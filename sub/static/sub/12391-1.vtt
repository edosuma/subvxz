What's with the Michael Jackson
outfit?

00:08.650 --> 00:09.674
That's, like,
two years old.

00:09.710 --> 00:11.086
I got scared.

00:11.120 --> 00:12.485
You were supposed to be
Billy Ocean.

00:15.090 --> 00:16.193
Why would Michael Jackson

00:16.230 --> 00:17.254
sign with Roland Orzabal?

00:17.300 --> 00:20.189
Why would Billy Ocean
sing with Roland Orzabal?

00:20.240 --> 00:22.629
'Cause he's awesome.

00:22.670 --> 00:25.207
Now we gotta add
the moonwalk into Shout

00:25.250 --> 00:27.445
and hope the judges
don't slam us for it.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.118
I don't know how
to moonwalk.

00:29.160 --> 00:30.252
You better learn quick.

00:32.360 --> 00:34.499

You're stiff.

01:08.630 --> 01:09.790
Inarticulate.

01:09.830 --> 01:12.401
Slightly jaundiced.
Asymmetrical.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.634
You smell.

01:13.680 --> 01:15.170
The one on the right--

01:15.210 --> 01:16.279
there's something
in your teeth.

01:16.320 --> 01:17.218
All in all,
I'd say

01:17.250 --> 01:18.547
there's absolutely
nothing worthwhile

01:18.590 --> 01:20.410
about either one of you.

01:21.460 --> 01:23.519
But we haven't even sang yet.

01:26.870 --> 01:27.666
I like 'em.

01:27.700 --> 01:29.361
Well, of course
you liked them.

Well, I--

01:32.610 --> 01:33.838

01:33.880 --> 01:35.518
Coming up after the break--

01:35.550 --> 01:36.983
You see what I mean?
Shh!

01:37.020 --> 01:38.954
You shooshing me
for reality TV?
Shh!

01:38.990 --> 01:40.958

Zip!

01:50.680 --> 01:52.614
Oh, for the love
of Lori Loughlin.

01:52.650 --> 01:55.426
Please use the pause button
just once.

01:55.460 --> 01:56.620
Why did we get TiVo

01:56.660 --> 01:57.991
if we never fast-forward

01:58.030 --> 01:59.429
and I can't stop
for commentary?

01:59.470 --> 02:00.232
[phone ringing]

02:00.240 --> 02:02.708
Whoa, no calls either.

02:03.940 --> 02:06.670
Gus, don't be
a rabid porcupine.

02:06.720 --> 02:07.914
This is just
another knockoff

02:07.950 --> 02:09.349
of the other knockoff

02:09.390 --> 02:10.812
of the original knockoff
of that other show.

02:10.860 --> 02:12.487
[Lester on TV]
And welcome back
to American Duos.

02:12.530 --> 02:13.827
First of all, Shawn,

02:13.860 --> 02:14.952
look at the guy
on the right.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.729
* American Duos *

02:16.770 --> 02:18.306
(Shawn)
Zapato?

02:18.340 --> 02:20.570
He's not black.
He's Latino.

02:20.610 --> 02:21.679
That's different.

02:21.710 --> 02:23.644
The contestants in this one
are duos,

02:23.680 --> 02:25.409
which makes it_
way more compelling.

02:25.450 --> 02:27.384
They have to mesh;
become one soul.

02:27.420 --> 02:29.888
Like V'ger and Stephen Collins
in Star Trek I.

02:29.930 --> 02:32.626
And they're shooting
in Santa Barbara this year,

02:32.670 --> 02:34.365
which more than compensates.

02:34.410 --> 02:35.399
[phone ringing]

02:35.440 --> 02:37.476
Don't you dare answer that.

02:37.510 --> 02:38.602
Dude, it's Jules.

02:38.650 --> 02:39.548
She could be bleeding
and in a ditch.

02:39.580 --> 02:41.389
She's not bleeding.
She could be in a ditch.

02:41.420 --> 02:42.284
She's not in a ditch.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.083
She could be lonely
and in the shower.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.451
She has a shower phone?
I certainly hope so.

02:45.490 --> 02:46.593
Dude, it's a win-win...

02:46.630 --> 02:48.723
except for the ditch one.

02:48.770 --> 02:49.862
Hello?

02:49.900 --> 02:53.370
Nothing...at all.

02:53.410 --> 02:54.775
We'll be right there.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.648
Shawn!

02:58.990 --> 03:00.355
(Shawn)
That's it.
I'm canceling the TiVo.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.487
No more frame-by-frame.

03:02.530 --> 03:03.622
No more Ghost Cat.

03:03.660 --> 03:04.922
I recorded that
by accident.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.166
Then why didn't you erase it
for three months?

03:06.200 --> 03:07.098
Fine, but I'm putting up

03:07.140 --> 03:08.835
the official Burton Guster
sp0|ler alert.

03:08.870 --> 03:10.679
Until I get back
and watch the recording,

03:10.710 --> 03:12.849
nobody utters a word
about American Duos.

03:12.880 --> 03:14.108
That's going to be difficult.

03:14.150 --> 03:15.447
Why?

03:19.090 --> 03:20.728
Oh, wow!
That's Nigel St. Nigel.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.131
You know,
you were totally unfair

03:24.170 --> 03:25.637
to Catherine Clement
In season two.

03:25.670 --> 03:27.831
I don't remember the person

03:27.880 --> 03:29.108
to whom you are referring.

03:29.150 --> 03:31.744
But she was hideous.

03:31.790 --> 03:33.781
This is them?

03:33.820 --> 03:36.220
Yes, this is Shawn Spencer
and Burton Guster--

03:36.260 --> 03:38.228
our resident psychic team.

03:38.260 --> 03:40.660
The answer is no.

03:40.700 --> 03:43.999
Mr. St. Nigel, this is exactly
what you asked for.

03:44.040 --> 03:45.041
Hear them out.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.240
There's no reason.

03:46.280 --> 03:49.886
Hear...them...out.

03:52.990 --> 03:54.526
Nigel needs protection.

03:54.570 --> 03:55.992
Do you realize
you're in a police station?

03:56.030 --> 03:58.237
I don't trust the police.

03:58.270 --> 03:59.669
They're useless.

03:59.710 --> 04:01.507
No offense.

04:01.550 --> 04:02.903
Oh, none taken.

04:02.950 --> 04:03.917
Mr. St. Nigel has been
the victim

04:03.950 --> 04:06.043
of a series of attempts
and threats on his life

04:06.090 --> 04:07.216
by a crazed stalker.

04:07.260 --> 04:09.922
He believes that even
the police

04:09.960 --> 04:11.666
_could somehow be
In on the conspiracy

04:11.700 --> 04:12.769
even though we've assured him
that--

04:12.800 --> 04:16.304
I can speak for myself.

04:16.340 --> 04:18.877
And stop slouching.

04:18.910 --> 04:19.740
Every time I bring in

04:19.780 --> 04:22.112
some sort _
of profe55ional protection

04:22.150 --> 04:23.754
my attacker gets closer.

04:23.790 --> 04:26.020
My car has been tampered with.

04:26.060 --> 04:27.857
My trailer has been
broken into.

04:27.900 --> 04:30.095
Accidents follow me everywhere.

04:30.140 --> 04:32.199
What I need is someone

04:32.240 --> 04:37.109
who can anticipate
my attacker's next move.

04:37.150 --> 04:39.618
Someone who can move about
undetected.

04:39.660 --> 04:40.911
You're talking about
a psychic.

04:40.960 --> 04:44.054
Someone who can see danger
before it occurs.

04:44.100 --> 04:45.328
Someone who can say,
"Nigel, duck!"

04:45.370 --> 04:47.634
before the bullet
exits the chamber.

04:47.670 --> 04:50.104
Spare me the theatrics.

04:50.140 --> 04:52.847
Can you do it or not?

04:52.880 --> 04:54.711
Look, we are asking you
to go undercover.

04:54.750 --> 04:56.012
No one outside of this office

04:56.050 --> 04:57.278
will know that
you're on the job.

04:57.320 --> 05:00.596
What about Detective Lassiter?

05:00.600 --> 05:02.966
Absolutely not.

05:03.000 --> 05:03.762
His hair looks like

05:03.800 --> 05:05.961

out of a cake mold.

to feel safe.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.326
Come up with a plan.

05:18.370 --> 05:19.962
You'll need to blend.

05:20.000 --> 05:20.989
Obviously the local police
already know you

05:21.040 --> 05:22.029
so a false identity--

05:22.070 --> 05:23.162
I already have a plan.

05:23.210 --> 05:24.199
You have a plan?

05:24.240 --> 05:26.105
What is it?

05:27.880 --> 05:29.017
Oh, I'm sorry.

to be stealth.

08:29.650 --> 08:30.674
on any one of us.

08:30.720 --> 08:32.449
But it didn't, Lester.

08:32.490 --> 08:34.185
It landed on me!

08:34.220 --> 08:36.450
You daft punk!

08:42.810 --> 08:44.801
Have you guys gone
completely insane?

08:44.840 --> 08:45.807
No.

08:45.850 --> 08:47.169
What was that?

08:47.220 --> 08:48.619
Us advancing
to the next round.

08:48.650 --> 08:50.151
You got half the words wrong!

08:50.190 --> 08:52.852
Jules, those A-ha guys
are Norwegian.

08:52.890 --> 08:53.857
They didn't even know
what they were singing.

08:53.890 --> 08:56.097
What are you planning on singing
for round two?

08:56.130 --> 08:57.165
Yankee Rose,
David Lee Roth.

08:58.270 --> 08:59.862
What?
Too obvious?

08:59.910 --> 09:01.070
No--Gus can sing
the guitar part.

09:01.080 --> 09:04.243
Guys, if you're gonna stay
in this competition,

09:04.280 --> 09:06.214
you're gonna need
to step it up--way up.

09:06.250 --> 09:08.115
Now, I have to go.

09:08.160 --> 09:09.718
I can't be seen talking to you.

09:09.760 --> 09:12.661
And not just because
you're undercover.

09:15.300 --> 09:17.507
Well, Nigel's essentially
a monster.

09:17.540 --> 09:19.303
He's an equal-opportunity
bastard.

09:19.350 --> 09:20.476
The list of suspects

09:20.510 --> 09:21.477
can be narrowed down
to everybody.

09:21.520 --> 09:22.714
Even I kind of want
to kill him.

09:22.750 --> 09:24.183
So where does that leave us?

09:24.220 --> 09:25.255
Well, there have been
at least nine incidents

09:25.290 --> 09:26.325
that can be counted

09:26.360 --> 09:28.920
as attempts on his life--
in nine different cities.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.666
We have to assume it's someone
who's here every week.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.361
Great.
No, not great.

09:32.410 --> 09:35.243
That only narrows it down
to crew, security, and fans.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.316
Most of which
are pretty die-hard.

09:37.350 --> 09:38.442
We're gonna have to talk
to everybody,

09:38.480 --> 09:39.788
which is gonna be difficult,

09:39.820 --> 09:41.310
because I think
I'm developing a polyp.

09:41.360 --> 09:45.797
[descending scales]
* Eee-e-e-e-e

09:45.830 --> 09:49.800
* Ah-a-a-a-a-ah

09:49.840 --> 09:51.330
Yo!

09:53.250 --> 09:55.411
I'm Shawn Spence Starr.

09:55.450 --> 09:57.850
This is my partner,
Gus 'l'l' Showbizz.

09:57.890 --> 09:59.585
The extra T
is for extra talent.

09:59.630 --> 10:00.927
(Shawn)
We just advanced
to the second round.

10:00.960 --> 10:02.461
Congratulations!

10:02.500 --> 10:03.831
Bevin.

10:03.870 --> 10:04.996
Bevin Rennie Llywellen.

10:05.040 --> 10:06.007
I'm next, I think.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.008
I think you got us beat
with that name already.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.747
[both forcing laughter]

10:10.780 --> 10:11.815
Where's your partner?

10:11.850 --> 10:13.681
I got rid of him.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.278
I sing both parts.

10:15.320 --> 10:17.356
The show's called
American Duos.

10:17.400 --> 10:18.822
(Bevin)
It's my hook.

10:18.860 --> 10:20.634
Everyone needs a thing,
right?

10:20.670 --> 10:22.399
I learned that last year.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.271
Good luck, dudes.

10:25.910 --> 10:26.945
He did it.

10:26.980 --> 10:27.969
Him?

10:28.020 --> 10:29.442
You talk to one dude
and you're done?

10:29.490 --> 10:31.685
_ _ His name
is Bevm Rennie Lleellen.

10:31.720 --> 10:33.028
Whoo hoo hoo!

10:33.060 --> 10:35.824
Whoo hoo!

10:35.870 --> 10:38.293
We made it!

10:38.340 --> 10:39.898
Hey, you fellow winners!

10:39.940 --> 10:40.702
Chance Cade.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.446
This here's my brother
Rance.

10:42.480 --> 10:43.742
We just made it
to the next round too.

10:45.550 --> 10:47.916
Rance...nice.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.622
Nigel just called us
a curious cocktail

10:50.660 --> 10:52.025
of inbreeding
and type 2 diabetes.

10:52.070 --> 10:54.538
But then he passed us through
anyway.

10:54.570 --> 10:56.106
That's hitting
below the belt.

10:56.140 --> 10:57.801
Yeah, well...

10:57.840 --> 10:59.341
Australian people are mean.

11:01.150 --> 11:01.309
Hey!
[snaps fingers]

11:01.320 --> 11:04.551
Let's go.

11:06.630 --> 11:07.597
I was wrong;
they did it.

11:07.630 --> 11:08.699
Shawn.

11:08.730 --> 11:11.995
[dance music playing]

11:12.040 --> 11:19.378
*

11:23.960 --> 11:25.496
The stalker
could've accessed

11:25.530 --> 11:26.519
the fallen light
from up here.

11:26.570 --> 11:27.764
He sure could've.

11:37.590 --> 11:39.558
You supposed to be
up here?

11:39.590 --> 11:41.455
Define "supposed to be."

11:47.980 --> 11:49.004
How do you expect me

11:49.050 --> 11:51.473
to carry you two howler monkeys
through tomorrow?

11:51.520 --> 11:52.589
Whoa.

11:52.620 --> 11:54.212
Well, I might've been
a little pitchy.

11:54.250 --> 11:55.854
I had a dairy-heavy
Jamba Juice.

11:55.890 --> 11:57.448
Stop the excuses.

11:57.500 --> 11:58.398
Step it up!

11:58.430 --> 12:00.933
I cannot carry you
through another round.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.564
I think I preferred
the stalker.

12:03.610 --> 12:04.599
(Shawn)
Don't.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.505
Don't what?

12:06.550 --> 12:08.108
Uh...smoke.

12:08.150 --> 12:09.515
Those things'll kill you.

12:09.550 --> 12:10.539
Well, add them to the list.

12:10.590 --> 12:13.525
[dramatic music]

12:13.560 --> 12:17.735
*

12:17.770 --> 12:18.737
Stop!

12:18.770 --> 12:20.635
I do not have physical contact

12:20.670 --> 12:22.979
with people with arm hair!

12:23.010 --> 12:25.012
That case--

12:25.050 --> 12:28.281
Was a gift from Les McKeown
of the Bay City Rollers.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.151
It's a very expensive bla--

12:30.190 --> 12:31.862
[electricity zapping]

12:37.610 --> 12:38.770
[thump]

12:38.810 --> 12:40.539
How many do we got, officer?

12:40.580 --> 12:42.047
A lot--you're sure
that you wanted

12:42.090 --> 12:43.318
everybody who was
in the building?

12:43.350 --> 12:44.317
Well, that's what I said,
isn't it?

12:44.350 --> 12:46.056
Everybody inside,
everybody outside.

12:46.090 --> 12:47.853
It's attempted murder.
I'm not screwing around here.

12:47.900 --> 12:48.798
Okay, but--

12:48.830 --> 12:51.333
Just stop talking
and open the door, please.

12:51.370 --> 12:52.302
Really, McNab,

12:52.340 --> 12:54.638
you might want to open
your ears for once.

12:54.680 --> 12:55.772
You could learn--

12:59.720 --> 13:01.312
Go get me some coffee.

13:02.890 --> 13:04.198
Great.

13:04.230 --> 13:06.221
What are you two doing
down at that competition?

13:06.270 --> 13:07.589
We're looking
for our big break.

13:07.640 --> 13:08.561
Do I get a phone call?

13:08.600 --> 13:11.603
No, I am trying
to conduct an investigation.

13:11.640 --> 13:12.675
Out!

13:12.710 --> 13:14.075
Don't you want to ask us
if we did it?

13:14.110 --> 13:16.783
Ask him.
I plead the Fifth.

13:19.260 --> 13:21.148
[laughter]

13:21.200 --> 13:22.997
What's happening,
undercover partner?

13:23.030 --> 13:25.362
No public discussion
of your undercover business.

13:25.400 --> 13:26.662
We need a choreographer.

13:26.710 --> 13:27.699
You need a choreographer.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.674
You both have many needs, so--

13:29.710 --> 13:31.712
So I'm getting
a very strong vibration

13:31.750 --> 13:32.739
that you can dance.

13:32.790 --> 13:35.827
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

13:38.800 --> 13:41.268
Well, I did go
to cheerleader camp.

13:41.300 --> 13:43.131
For two weeks.
I got kicked out.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.899
Kicked out?
Yeah, it's a long story.

13:46.480 --> 13:47.777
who steal nail polish
and then pass out

13:47.820 --> 13:48.809
when you slap 'em
a little bit

13:48.850 --> 13:50.715
on the back of the head.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.293
Jules, listen--
I can feel in my heart

13:55.330 --> 13:57.127
that you can get
into the groove.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.728
Now, we need to step it up,
literally.

13:58.770 --> 14:01.671
And we need to stomp the yard...
figuratively.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.740
This is an elite class
of performer.

14:04.780 --> 14:07.089
Shawn, 97 teams have advanced
to round two.

14:07.120 --> 14:08.758
We're out of time.
You're all we've got.

14:08.790 --> 14:09.757
Everything's riding on this!

14:09.790 --> 14:10.950
Step up to the plate!

14:14.170 --> 14:15.967
[whispering]
Guys.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.741
Sit.

14:19.780 --> 14:21.509
Okay, look--

14:21.550 --> 14:23.415
the only time
I have ever danced publicly

14:23.450 --> 14:25.759
was in a high school performance
of Everybody Hip-Hop!

14:25.790 --> 14:28.020
which closed after
two performances.

14:28.060 --> 14:29.869
Jules, all we do is argue.

14:29.900 --> 14:30.889
Gus is very stubborn.

14:30.940 --> 14:32.464
We need a guiding force.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.001
A Svengali, if you will.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.099
Shawn, I'm a detective,
not a Svengali.

14:36.150 --> 14:37.105
Jules--
Shawn, I think I would know

14:37.150 --> 14:38.947
ifI were a Svengali.

14:39.920 --> 14:40.989
Fine.

14:41.020 --> 14:42.248
Whatever.

14:42.290 --> 14:45.794
I guess my heart vibes
are jammed.

14:45.830 --> 14:47.388
Never mind.

14:54.950 --> 14:55.917
Wait.

14:55.950 --> 14:57.144
So what exactly do you do

14:57.190 --> 14:58.282
on the show,
Zappko?

14:58.320 --> 14:59.548
Zapato.

14:59.590 --> 15:00.852
It's immaterial.

15:00.900 --> 15:01.798
I'm a judge.

15:01.800 --> 15:04.098
What kind of judge?

15:04.140 --> 15:08.201
A talent judge...
on camera.

15:08.240 --> 15:09.275
Sit on the far left.

15:09.310 --> 15:10.948
Really?

15:12.250 --> 15:13.239
Have you seen the show?

15:13.290 --> 15:14.382
Yeah, a hundred times.

15:14.420 --> 15:16.058
I'm sure I would've
remembered you.

15:16.090 --> 15:17.921
[laughs]
I can't believe this.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.622
I was the first person
hired for the show.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.262
My first record went gold.

15:22.300 --> 15:24.905
* Mira me

15:27.150 --> 15:28.117
Well, you are spinning yourself
into circles,

15:28.150 --> 15:29.447
whoever you are.

15:29.480 --> 15:30.913
Maybe you should go outside
and rethink your story.

15:30.960 --> 15:31.984
What story?

15:32.030 --> 15:33.452
Exactly.

15:33.490 --> 15:34.855
Get him out of here.

15:37.540 --> 15:39.906
Keep an eye on that one.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.977
Who's next?

15:43.010 --> 15:45.342
Yeah, great,
the Bride of Frankenstein.

15:45.380 --> 15:47.109
Have a seat.

15:48.990 --> 15:49.957
What am I doing here?

15:49.990 --> 15:51.423
Well, let's see.

15:51.460 --> 15:53.564
_ Your trailer_'s
right next to Nigel's.

15:53.600 --> 15:54.726
You hate him.

15:54.770 --> 15:57.170
And you can't seem to account
for your whereabouts

15:57.210 --> 15:58.279
for most of the last 60 days.

15:58.310 --> 15:59.709
Everybody hates Nigel.

15:59.740 --> 16:01.719
And Everybody Loves Raymond.

16:01.750 --> 16:04.014
But everybody doesn't have
a vacant sense of morality

16:04.060 --> 16:06.255
and an assault with a deadly
weapon charge on their record.

16:06.290 --> 16:08.599
That was a publicity stunt.

16:08.630 --> 16:12.031
The "weapon" was a forklift
and I was drunk

16:12.070 --> 16:14.732
on a spray bottle
of Charlie.

16:14.780 --> 16:15.929
Well, I'm gonna need
some answers, and fast.

16:15.980 --> 16:18.016
Otherwise you and I are gonna
turn on the hot lights,

16:18.050 --> 16:20.484
do the "Lindsay Hop"
and see who cracks first.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.283
Now you're trying
to seduce me.

16:22.330 --> 16:24.127
I never thought
I would make this sound

16:24.160 --> 16:27.163
in my lifetime,
but. . .ew.

16:30.110 --> 16:33.409
You left me alone
half the day.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.145
You were at a police station.

16:35.180 --> 16:37.114
You'll never make it
as bodyguards.

16:37.160 --> 16:38.149
We're not bodyguards.

16:38.190 --> 16:40.556
You'll never make it
as anything.

16:43.830 --> 16:45.092
Oh, thank God!

16:45.140 --> 16:47.131
I'm starving.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.807
Hmm.

16:48.840 --> 16:50.068
What do you got there?

16:50.110 --> 16:52.249
My standing order.

16:53.490 --> 16:56.550
[humming]

16:56.590 --> 16:57.625
Wait!

16:58.760 --> 16:59.727
Give it back!

16:59.760 --> 17:00.795
[English accent]
No.

17:00.830 --> 17:02.036
Give it back!

17:02.040 --> 17:03.359
No.

17:03.410 --> 17:04.559
[splat]

17:04.610 --> 17:07.249
What is it with you
and throwing things?

17:08.380 --> 17:09.415
Don't eat that!

17:09.450 --> 17:10.542
Why the devil not?

17:10.590 --> 17:11.750
'Cause I'm getting

17:11.790 --> 17:13.587
a very strong feeling
about this sandwich.

17:13.630 --> 17:14.585
It's--

17:14.630 --> 17:15.619
Delicious?

17:15.660 --> 17:16.627
No.
Herb-crusted?

17:16.670 --> 17:18.228
No!

17:18.270 --> 17:20.101
It's not from
the hotel kitchen.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.129
And?

17:21.180 --> 17:24.115
And...
it's poisoned.

17:24.150 --> 17:25.811
Aah!

17:30.290 --> 17:33.123
Well, it stings, but it looks
like Spencer was right.

17:33.170 --> 17:34.068
According to the toxicology
reports,

17:34.100 --> 17:36.204
there's enough drugs
to kill a Clydesdale

17:36.240 --> 17:38.504

sandWIch.

17:38.540 --> 17:40.144

one room.

painted on my back.

17:46.930 --> 17:48.727

with the screen

17:50.230 --> 17:51.595

You can return
when we clear it.

slightly more pressmg issues

17:56.750 --> 17:57.842
at the moment.

17:57.880 --> 17:58.949
We need to rehearse.

17:58.980 --> 18:00.845
How did you know
that sandwich

18:00.890 --> 18:01.879
didn't come from
the kitchen?

18:01.920 --> 18:04.252
Easy, there were only
83 sesame seeds on his bun.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.393
All the other ones
from the hotel have 87.

18:06.430 --> 18:07.931
Are you serious?
No.

we found prints.

Was he in
a little red corvette?

18:18.390 --> 18:19.482
Under the cherry moon?

18:19.520 --> 18:20.828
Finger prints!

18:20.860 --> 18:22.327
They belong
to Emilina Saffron.

27:20.770 --> 27:22.635
Is that--damn!

27:22.680 --> 27:24.079
I built that table.

27:24.110 --> 27:25.008
Really?

27:25.050 --> 27:27.484
I'm pretty sure
ifI were to build a table,

27:27.520 --> 27:30.455
I would start by using wood
that had never drifted.

27:30.490 --> 27:31.752
All right, you know--
thaUsit

27:31.800 --> 27:32.892
Already?

27:32.930 --> 27:34.466
I'm just getting started.

27:34.500 --> 27:35.762
I've got a sonnet
for each piece

27:35.800 --> 27:37.358
of fish paraphernalia.
Oh, yeah?

27:37.410 --> 27:38.604
Well I got an ice-cold can
of whip-ass

27:38.640 --> 27:39.800
just sitting in that fridge!

27:39.840 --> 27:42.673
Actually,
that's diet whip-ass.

27:42.720 --> 27:44.517
Yeah!
You must be out
of your damn mind!

27:44.550 --> 27:46.051
Dude, you have three full cobs!

27:46.090 --> 27:47.057
I will slap you, Shawn.

27:47.090 --> 27:48.125
Now, tell me--

27:48.160 --> 27:49.525
are you absolutely certain

27:49.560 --> 27:50.959
that this cow shoulder
on my plate

27:51.000 --> 27:52.558
is in fact dead?

27:52.600 --> 27:53.828
I'm just asking.

27:53.870 --> 27:55.030
That's it--
take off the robe!

27:55.070 --> 27:56.628
Wearing that robe
is a privilege

27:56.680 --> 27:57.772
and you, pal,
have just lost it!

27:57.810 --> 27:59.619
I steadfastly refuse.

27:59.650 --> 28:02.653
This is the plushiest,
most opulent robe

28:02.690 --> 28:04.385
I've ever had the pleasure
of wearing.

28:04.430 --> 28:05.556
Well, there's one thing
we could agree on.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.498
Now give it up.

28:06.530 --> 28:08.020
No.

28:08.070 --> 28:10.664
I feel like an angel baby

28:10.710 --> 28:14.407
swaddled in a cocoon
of cloud candy.

28:14.450 --> 28:16.179
You either take it off,
or I'll take it off for you.

28:16.220 --> 28:17.539
Dad, I don't think
you're thinking this through.

28:17.590 --> 28:18.454
Shawn!
Dad!

28:18.490 --> 28:19.889
I'm pretty sure he's
90ng commando under--

28:19.920 --> 28:21.057
Ow! Ow!

28:21.090 --> 28:22.626
Keep playin', Shawn.
Go ahead.

28:22.660 --> 28:24.662
What kind of sick bastard
goes commando

28:24.700 --> 28:26.861
underneath another man's robe?

28:26.910 --> 28:27.865
All right, all right.

28:27.910 --> 28:29.537
All right!
Come with me.

28:29.580 --> 28:30.672
Come with me!
Come on.

28:30.710 --> 28:33.508
Dad, just walk it off.

28:33.550 --> 28:34.642
He's not staying here.

28:34.690 --> 28:36.009
He violated basic robe code.

28:36.060 --> 28:37.652
Robe code violation--
check.

28:37.690 --> 28:39.123
Look, Shawn, there's a reason
this guy's on the run.

28:39.160 --> 28:40.969
He's been here ten minutes,
even I want to kill him!

28:41.000 --> 28:41.796
That's the problem, Dad.

28:41.830 --> 28:43.639
How do I protect him
from everybody?

28:43.670 --> 28:44.739
You've already got
a suspect in jail.

28:44.770 --> 28:45.805
She was just released.

28:45.840 --> 28:46.909
Now we have a plethora
of suspects

28:46.950 --> 28:47.905
and no way
to narrow them down.

28:47.950 --> 28:48.917
It's easy;
tighten your focus.

28:48.950 --> 28:50.713
Who does he victimize
the most?

28:50.750 --> 28:53.685
Is that peach cobbler
in the fridge for everybody?

28:54.660 --> 28:57.060
I'm sorry.
Not today.

28:57.100 --> 28:58.226
I don't think so.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.602
I showed him!

29:00.640 --> 29:02.699
It'll all go away.

29:02.740 --> 29:04.879
Hmm.
You think it's funny?

29:06.750 --> 29:08.081
Nigel!

29:08.120 --> 29:10.884
Naughty!

29:10.930 --> 29:14.058
I hope you have
some food in there.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.192
Aah!

(Vick)
Mr. Spencer, Mr. Guster,

29:31.730 --> 29:32.936
I'm afraid
I have some unfortunate news.

29:32.970 --> 29:34.767
Emilina Saffron was found
in the bathroom

29:34.810 --> 29:36.334
of her hotel_ suite
this morning.

29:36.380 --> 29:37.608
She was clinging to life
and has been rushed

29:37.650 --> 29:39.777
to St. Thomas of the Apostles.

29:39.820 --> 29:40.946
And so far all signs

29:40.990 --> 29:42.685
point to an overdose
of some sort.

29:42.720 --> 29:44.028
But we are fully investigating
the matter.

29:44.060 --> 29:45.322
Overdose?

29:45.360 --> 29:47.726
She injected herself
with enough tranquilizers

29:47.770 --> 29:48.998
to kill an adult rhinoceros.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.769
But how did she escape?

29:50.810 --> 29:53.335
Mr. St. Nigel,
Ms. Saffron was released

29:53.380 --> 29:55.610
this morning,
after her alibi checked out.

29:55.650 --> 29:56.469
She is the last person

29:56.520 --> 29:57.714
that you should
be worried about now.

29:57.750 --> 29:59.354
We have to cancel the show.

29:59.390 --> 30:00.652
Are you kidding?

30:00.690 --> 30:02.226
Look, I don't want to seem
insensitive,

30:02.260 --> 30:03.591
but this is the third time
this season

30:03.600 --> 30:05.022
she's been in the ICU.

30:05.070 --> 30:06.094
Not like this.

30:06.140 --> 30:08.404
I will not go on.

30:08.440 --> 30:09.771
I'll be a sitting duck
out there.

30:09.810 --> 30:11.744
I will personally oversee

30:11.780 --> 30:13.338
your security detail,
Mr. St. Nigel.

30:13.380 --> 30:14.779
We'll all be out there
together.

30:14.820 --> 30:16.117
You'll be just ﬁne.
Suck it up.

30:16.160 --> 30:17.127
Now I gotta bolt.

30:17.160 --> 30:18.821
I'm way late
for my Pilates.

30:24.870 --> 30:26.428
Lester Beacon sure didn't seem
too broken up

30:26.480 --> 30:27.447
about Emilina.

30:27.480 --> 30:28.708
He sure didn't.

30:28.750 --> 30:30.274
Plus, his hair.

30:41.010 --> 30:42.307
You have a plan yet?

30:42.340 --> 30:43.432
Gus, I'm a lyrical gangster.

30:43.480 --> 30:45.141
I'll use some colorful
vernacular

30:45.180 --> 30:46.886
and if necessary,
you'll engage in fisticuffs.

30:46.920 --> 30:48.080
Shh.

31:03.720 --> 31:07.508
[both gasping]

31:07.560 --> 31:09.790
That was close.
Too close.

31:14.070 --> 31:15.264
Huh.

31:15.310 --> 31:16.800
No guard.

31:16.840 --> 31:18.376
We did all that sneaking around

31:18.410 --> 31:19.877
because you thought
they put a guard

31:19.920 --> 31:21.046
at Emilina's empty hotel room?

31:21.090 --> 31:22.489
Seemed like a decent theory
at the time.

31:22.520 --> 31:23.782
You better have the key.

31:29.400 --> 31:30.492
(Gus)
What are we looking for?

31:30.540 --> 31:31.529
(Shawn)
Beats me.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.117
Damn.

31:36.150 --> 31:37.981
Seems clean.

32:09.450 --> 32:11.486
That's what you get
for drinking whole milk, Shawn.

like granite.

32:15.290 --> 32:17.121
And we just got ourselves
a clue.

32:19.270 --> 32:20.237
What is it?

32:20.270 --> 32:21.601
(Shawn)
I don't know.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.005
Reach in there
and fish it out.

32:23.040 --> 32:24.041
I'm not putting my hand
in there.

32:24.080 --> 32:25.047
You do it.

32:25.080 --> 32:26.377
Gus, I found it.
You get it.

32:26.420 --> 32:27.387
That's how it works.

32:27.420 --> 32:28.546
I'm not putting my hand

32:41.980 --> 32:44.084
You gotta get us in there
as soon as possible.

32:44.120 --> 32:45.951
Oh, and, uh...
bring gloves.

32:50.060 --> 32:51.288
Oh, my God!

32:51.330 --> 32:53.662
It's just as I imagined.

32:53.700 --> 32:55.975
Oh, I am feeling something
in here.

32:56.010 --> 32:56.999
Right here?

32:57.050 --> 32:58.039
Did you bring the gloves?

32:58.080 --> 32:59.047
Yeah, I brought
the gloves.

Wow, Shawn, that's amazing.

33:12.740 --> 33:14.298
How did you know that?

33:14.350 --> 33:17.786
I feel things...deeply.

33:17.820 --> 33:19.117
Yeah.

33:23.660 --> 33:25.321
I need to speak with Emilina

33:54.830 --> 33:56.695
You know, before she started

No.

34:03.710 --> 34:04.074
But I will be right here
when she does.

34:04.080 --> 34:06.810
I can tell you that.

34:06.850 --> 34:08.886
That's...

35:20.960 --> 35:23.690

he wouldn't advance.

36:57.060 --> 36:58.982
Mr. Spencer,
last time I checked,

36:59.030 --> 37:03.069
Emilina overdosed on her own
prescription medication.

37:03.100 --> 37:06.206
That's precisely what
Bevin Rennie Llywellen

37:06.240 --> 37:07.901
wanted you to think.

37:07.950 --> 37:09.815
That's really his name?

37:09.850 --> 37:11.943
That's the wanker w_ho auditioned
in every City.

37:11.990 --> 37:14.584
Just another slice
of deception.

37:14.630 --> 37:16.086
The truth is,
he can sing like a bird.

37:16.130 --> 37:17.119
But if you heard that,

37:17.160 --> 37:19.025
he wouldn't have
to reaudition

37:19.070 --> 37:21.868
in every city on the tour.

37:21.910 --> 37:23.832
Every city
that you almost died in, Nigel.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.279
And after Emilina
was released,

37:25.310 --> 37:28.017
he tried to silence her
for good

37:28.050 --> 37:30.883
before she could put it all
together.

37:33.860 --> 37:34.861
Put what together?

37:34.900 --> 37:38.108
And who might this be,
Detectives?

37:38.140 --> 37:39.778
Meet Bevin Rennie Llywellen.

37:39.810 --> 37:41.107
Ms. Saffron woke up
out of her coma,

37:41.140 --> 37:43.017
rabbit-punched me
in the sternum,

37:43.050 --> 37:45.018
and remembered this guy
as one of her assailants.

37:45.050 --> 37:48.156
This crystal puts him
at the scene of the crime.

37:48.190 --> 37:49.691
(Vick)
So he made an attempt

37:49.730 --> 37:51.322
on Emilina's life.

37:51.360 --> 37:53.169
Allegedly poisoned

37:53.200 --> 37:54.337
a tuna salad sandwich.

37:54.370 --> 37:57.669
Uh, tuna Nicoise salad
sandwich, Chief.

37:57.710 --> 37:59.041
There's a difference.

37:59.080 --> 38:00.945
(Vick)
But what about all the other
near misses With Nigel?

38:00.980 --> 38:03.016
But it can't be him.
It's impossible.

38:03.060 --> 38:04.550
He was just a contestant.

38:04.560 --> 38:06.949
Sounds like he had
somebody

38:07.000 --> 38:09.560
on the inside.

38:13.340 --> 38:15.649
He had somebody
on the inside.

38:15.680 --> 38:17.147
Didn't he?

38:17.180 --> 38:19.114
Zzzapato!

38:19.150 --> 38:21.254
[Nigel chuckling]
Oh.

38:21.290 --> 38:23.121
Don't be ridiculous.

38:23.160 --> 38:26.095
Zapato adores me.

38:26.130 --> 38:27.165
Plus he can't even think.

38:27.200 --> 38:29.236
Oh, it has to be someone else.

38:29.270 --> 38:32.103
Um, how about Lester?

38:32.150 --> 38:34.414
Oh, I'd love to see him
in prison.

38:34.450 --> 38:37.351
Bevin is Zapato's biggest fan.

38:39.900 --> 38:41.197
(Shawn)
They actually became
pretty good friends.

38:41.230 --> 38:42.697
And I don't think this show

38:42.740 --> 38:43.832
turned out to be
quite the comeback

38:43.870 --> 38:45.337
either of them were
hoping for.

38:48.950 --> 38:50.315
I could go on.

38:51.180 --> 38:52.750
But why don't you
take the floor?

38:52.790 --> 38:55.884
Zzzapato.

38:55.930 --> 38:57.795
Well, what could he say?

38:57.830 --> 38:59.092
He can't even speak.

38:59.130 --> 39:01.166
Yes, I can!

39:01.200 --> 39:02.337
But you don't let me.

39:02.370 --> 39:04.679
I was the first to sign on.

39:04.680 --> 39:07.012
This was supposed to be
my show!

39:07.050 --> 39:09.450
My shot, my comeback!

39:09.490 --> 39:12.254
You turned me into a simp.
I freakin' hate you!

39:12.290 --> 39:13.496
People don't even know
who I am.

39:13.530 --> 39:16.795
I get fan letters addressed
to Geraldo,

39:16.840 --> 39:21.004
Riclq Martin, and that guy
from El Pollo Loco commercial!

39:22.510 --> 39:23.477
You ruined everything!

39:23.520 --> 39:26.239
Why won't you die?

39:27.420 --> 39:28.751
(Vick)
Oh--oh!

39:28.790 --> 39:30.291
Argh!

39:30.330 --> 39:33.265
Really?
That was your plan?

39:33.300 --> 39:35.336
That has to be

39:35.370 --> 39:38.407
the poorest-executed attack
in history.

39:38.450 --> 39:42.819
I was two feet away from you
all the time.

39:42.860 --> 39:45.021
I mean, you have to be

39:45.060 --> 39:46.459
absolutely, without doubt,

39:46.490 --> 39:51.405
the worst murderer
I have ever seen.

of rodeo clowns up there.

Nothing was in synch.

41:39.490 --> 41:42.084

are ridiculous.

41:43.760 --> 41:46.160

additional torture
