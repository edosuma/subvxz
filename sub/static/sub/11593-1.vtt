01:14.230 --> 01:16.130
So, we keep headin' east?

01:16.170 --> 01:19.900
Yeah, that's the idea.

01:19.940 --> 01:21.740
Stay out of the big cities?

01:21.770 --> 01:23.370
Uh-huh.

01:26.580 --> 01:29.640
I think I'm tired.

01:29.680 --> 01:33.080
Yeah. Me, too.

01:37.860 --> 01:40.660
Here.

01:40.690 --> 01:43.530
Bring it on up to the office.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.460
I'm going to go check us out.

01:45.500 --> 01:46.930
All right.

03:11.980 --> 03:13.750
What took you so long?

03:13.790 --> 03:15.340
Nothing.

03:18.660 --> 03:20.590
I had a little trouble
with the maid...

03:20.630 --> 03:24.360
but everything's fine now.

03:30.640 --> 03:31.970
Damn.

03:33.970 --> 03:35.630
8:00.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.770
It's already this hot.

03:37.810 --> 03:40.340
Yep.

03:40.380 --> 03:42.610
How are we fixed for water?

03:42.650 --> 03:44.710
Probably not enough.

03:44.750 --> 03:46.880
Yeah.

03:54.630 --> 03:58.890
There's a cooler in the back
in the office.

05:41.130 --> 05:42.360
Hey.

05:56.250 --> 05:58.380
Shh.

06:05.760 --> 06:09.820
Aah! Aah! Aah!

06:09.860 --> 06:12.390
Sarah, honey, what's wrong?

06:12.430 --> 06:14.400
Huh?

06:14.430 --> 06:17.270
What is it, sweetie? Hmm?

06:17.300 --> 06:18.770
- Daddy.
- Yeah?

06:18.800 --> 06:21.600
- Daddy.
- Daddy's here.

06:21.640 --> 06:25.510
- Daddy's here.
- There were monsters.

06:25.540 --> 06:29.640
No, sweetie. There's
no such thing as monsters.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.380
You were just having
a bad dream.

06:31.420 --> 06:32.580
What's wrong, Dad?

06:34.450 --> 06:38.180
Hi, kiddo.
Sarah's just having a bad dream.

06:38.220 --> 06:39.990
Oh.

06:40.030 --> 06:42.120
I saw monsters, Jack.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.990
Monsters?

06:44.030 --> 06:45.720
What kind?

06:45.770 --> 06:48.100
I don't know.
They came out of my closet...

06:48.130 --> 06:49.690
and then
they were in the shadows.

06:49.740 --> 06:52.640
Mmm, shadow monsters.

06:52.670 --> 06:53.800
Well, they look pretty scary...

06:53.840 --> 06:55.470
but they really
can't do anything...

06:55.510 --> 06:57.140
especially
when the lights are on.

06:57.180 --> 06:58.800
They're scared of the light.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.810
What happened, baby?

07:01.950 --> 07:04.110
- You OK?
- I'm OK.

07:04.150 --> 07:06.050
Sarah had a bad dream
about monsters.

07:06.090 --> 07:08.210
- Oh.
- And I was telling her...

07:08.250 --> 07:10.090
that there's
no such thing as monsters.

07:10.120 --> 07:11.490
Oh.

07:11.520 --> 07:14.190
I'm going to turn on
my night light just in case.

07:14.230 --> 07:16.720
That sounds like
a brilliant solution.

07:18.130 --> 07:19.460
Mmm.

07:23.940 --> 07:26.840
- Hey, Jack?
- Hey, Mom?

07:26.870 --> 07:29.400
Morning.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.000
Morning, baby.

07:33.680 --> 07:36.240
Hey, hon,
the pick up still won't start.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.340
You mind dropping me off
on the way in?

07:37.380 --> 07:38.480
Sure.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.150
- Did you feed Burrow?
- Yeah, I fed him.

07:44.190 --> 07:46.520
All right. Good.

07:46.560 --> 07:48.550
The night light worked,
didn't it?

07:52.630 --> 07:54.530
I got it, Dad.

08:00.470 --> 08:03.410
What do you got going today,
Jack?

08:03.440 --> 08:05.740
Uh, nothing much.
A math test in a few days...

08:05.780 --> 08:09.180
and I think we're playing
baseball in gym class today...

08:09.220 --> 08:12.280
so I can look forward
to sucking hard in right field.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.910
Well, just remember...

08:15.290 --> 08:16.780
don't let the hitter
get the ball over your head...

08:16.820 --> 08:19.420
Unless it's out of the park.

08:19.460 --> 08:22.450
Well, yeah.

08:46.820 --> 08:48.340
Bye.

08:51.020 --> 08:52.650
I get off early today.
All I have...

08:52.690 --> 08:55.390
is the Watsons-Willard Day
bride's tractor sale.

08:55.430 --> 08:57.190
You want me to pick you up?

08:58.330 --> 08:59.920
Yeah.

08:59.970 --> 09:03.160
Then we can go to the drive-in
and make out tonight.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.640
There hasn't been
a drive-in here...

09:04.670 --> 09:06.870
since the early seventies,
but...

09:09.170 --> 09:10.770
I love you.

09:10.810 --> 09:12.330
I love you.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.870
- Have a good one.
- You, too.

09:25.620 --> 09:27.720
- Morning.
- Derek.

09:28.930 --> 09:31.230
- Hey, Tom.
- Morning, Joseph.

09:42.910 --> 09:45.470
That's wild.

09:45.510 --> 09:47.640
- Hey, Tom.
- Morning, Pat.

09:47.680 --> 09:50.310
- Hey, Mick.
- Tom.

09:50.350 --> 09:51.840
Charles is going to be
a little late this morning.

09:51.880 --> 09:54.680
- Is he drunk again?
- Yeah, I guess.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.750
Hey, who's the craziest woman
you ever dated?

09:57.790 --> 09:59.090
Me?

09:59.120 --> 10:00.390
Yeah. Mick and me,
we were talking...

10:00.430 --> 10:01.550
about some of the girls
we went with.

10:01.590 --> 10:04.030
- Uh-huh.
- He once dated a girl...

10:04.060 --> 10:06.550
who used to attack him
in the middle of the night.

10:06.600 --> 10:09.070
- She what?
- Yeah.

10:09.100 --> 10:11.590
She used to have
these crazy goddamn dreams...

10:11.640 --> 10:12.730
where instead
of her boyfriend...

10:12.770 --> 10:14.240
I was
some kind of demented killer.

10:14.270 --> 10:18.180
I woke up one night, she stuck
a goddamn fork in my shoulder.

10:18.210 --> 10:22.670
- You're kidding me.
- No. I'm spurting blood.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.080
She's sitting there crying...

10:24.120 --> 10:26.740
going,
"Baby, I love you, I love you."

10:28.150 --> 10:30.210
So, what happened?
You broke up with her, right?

10:30.260 --> 10:32.350
No, I married her.

10:35.530 --> 10:37.320
Hey, it lasted six years.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.230
Nobody's perfect, Tom.

10:39.260 --> 10:42.500
I guess not.

10:45.870 --> 10:49.900
Strike this guy out.
We got 'em. Let's go.

10:51.340 --> 10:53.330
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:53.380 --> 10:54.810
Two out.

11:00.290 --> 11:02.340
One winning run
coming right up, boys.

11:02.390 --> 11:03.980
- Go, Bobby!
- Whoo!

11:04.020 --> 11:06.250
It's all right, Billy.

11:07.690 --> 11:09.460
Look alive, look alive.

11:14.430 --> 11:15.990
Yeah!

11:17.840 --> 11:19.170
Ball.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.540
Yeah, that's it.

11:20.570 --> 11:22.200
He's got nothing.
He's got nothing.

11:22.240 --> 11:24.900
Let's go, let's go.
One more. Come on, now.

11:27.050 --> 11:29.110
Come on, Bobby.

11:29.150 --> 11:31.910
Yeah. He's yours, he's yours.

11:31.950 --> 11:35.320
- Oh!
- Whoo!

11:35.350 --> 11:37.880
- Whoo!
- Easy, Jack. Come on, Jack.

11:37.920 --> 11:39.720
Don't drop it, Jack!

11:39.760 --> 11:41.620
- That's yours. Come on.
- Jinx, Jackie boy!

11:41.660 --> 11:42.790
- Oh!
- Oh!

11:42.830 --> 11:46.230
Game over!
Yellows win. Let's go, guys.

11:46.270 --> 11:48.600
Taylor, Dietrich,
you're on equipment. Let's go.

11:53.710 --> 11:55.110
Guys, come on. Let's go.

11:55.140 --> 11:57.170
- Good try, Bobby.
- You was robbed, Bobby.

11:57.210 --> 11:59.940
Everyone hit the showers.

11:59.980 --> 12:01.310
- Awesome.
- Nice.

12:04.350 --> 12:05.870
Good job.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.970
Guess you think
you're hot shit, huh, Stall?

12:21.000 --> 12:24.700
What? No, I don't.

12:24.740 --> 12:26.900
Little hero here, huh?

12:26.940 --> 12:28.770
Little superstar here.

12:28.810 --> 12:31.780
Little hero saves the day
at the last minute, right?

12:31.810 --> 12:34.340
Bobby, it's just a game, OK?

12:34.380 --> 12:37.080
It's just stupid gym class.

12:37.120 --> 12:39.280
Who you calling stupid?

12:39.320 --> 12:43.380
Ahem.
No, I said gym class was stupid.

12:43.420 --> 12:46.880
"No, I said gym class was..."
Listen to this little faggot.

12:46.930 --> 12:50.490
Yeah. You're right.

12:50.530 --> 12:54.160
I'm both little and a faggot.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.530
You got me dead to rights.

12:56.570 --> 12:59.000
Come on, chickenshit,
let's do this.

13:00.210 --> 13:01.730
What would be the point?

13:01.770 --> 13:04.740
I mean, you win.
You win, you win.

13:04.780 --> 13:08.510
You've established
your alpha male standing.

13:08.550 --> 13:12.280
You've established
my unworthiness.

13:12.320 --> 13:15.380
But doing violence to me
just seems... ahem...

13:15.420 --> 13:18.390
pointless and cruel,
don't you think?

13:18.420 --> 13:20.190
Let's do this, you punk bitch.

13:20.230 --> 13:24.630
Shouldn't that be little punk
ass chickenshit faggot bitch?

13:26.430 --> 13:29.200
Chickenshit faggot bitch.

13:30.740 --> 13:32.830
Uh-oh.

13:34.140 --> 13:36.230
God!

13:41.680 --> 13:44.150
Bobby is a chickenshit.

14:05.900 --> 14:07.960
Hey, good looking.

14:13.450 --> 14:15.940
Where are we going?

14:17.880 --> 14:21.380
Well, Jack's studying
over at Judy Danvers'...

14:21.420 --> 14:25.410
and Martha's
taking care of Sarah.

14:25.460 --> 14:28.520
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:30.730 --> 14:32.890
So, where are we going?

14:35.470 --> 14:39.430
We never got to be teenagers
together.

14:39.470 --> 14:41.800
Uh-huh.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.740
I'm going to fix that.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.520
What's going on in there?

15:28.550 --> 15:31.580
Keep your shirt on. I'm coming.

15:44.940 --> 15:49.070
Holy cow.

15:50.310 --> 15:51.610
What?

15:58.580 --> 16:02.020
Do you need some help with that,
big boy?

16:02.050 --> 16:05.350
Uh... maybe.

16:09.290 --> 16:12.130
Oh, my God.

16:22.370 --> 16:23.930
What have you done with my wife?

16:23.980 --> 16:26.500
Ready? OK!

16:26.550 --> 16:30.210
Go, Wildcats!

16:31.780 --> 16:34.310
No wives in here, mister.

16:37.320 --> 16:39.190
Mmm.

16:40.960 --> 16:43.260
- Wow.
- Shh.

16:43.300 --> 16:46.320
Quiet.
My parents are in the next room.

16:48.200 --> 16:49.670
Mmm.

16:57.810 --> 16:59.870
You're naughty.

17:27.609 --> 17:29.870
What are you doing?

17:31.810 --> 17:33.540
Nothing.

17:36.280 --> 17:39.220
You are such a bad boy.

17:39.250 --> 17:41.120
Mm-hmm.

17:42.390 --> 17:45.410
Rah, rah, sis, boom, bah.

17:50.900 --> 17:52.260
Oh.

17:52.300 --> 17:56.230
There wasn't much of that
in high school.

17:58.300 --> 18:00.170
Ah...

18:02.510 --> 18:04.240
Mmm.

18:14.890 --> 18:17.410
- Uhh.
- Mmm.

18:22.790 --> 18:25.420
What is it?

18:27.170 --> 18:29.530
Huh?

18:29.570 --> 18:33.770
I remember the moment
I knew you were in love with me.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.940
I saw it in your eyes.

18:42.110 --> 18:44.610
I can still see it.

18:47.490 --> 18:49.610
Of course you can.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.960
I still love you.

19:11.840 --> 19:15.640
I'm the luckiest
son of a bitch alive.

19:18.720 --> 19:22.310
You are the best man
I've ever known.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.810
There's no luck involved.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.400
You want to go down
and get some food or something?

19:40.440 --> 19:42.500
You ever wonder
what kids did for fun...

19:42.540 --> 19:45.530
on a Saturday night
a hundred years ago?

19:45.580 --> 19:48.010
I don't know.

19:48.050 --> 19:49.380
I guess I always figured...

19:49.410 --> 19:50.940
they got into
their parents' wagon...

19:50.980 --> 19:52.810
and went cruising
up and down their main drag...

19:52.850 --> 19:55.680
playing loud banjo music
and acting like idiots.

19:57.890 --> 20:00.980
So, you think
this is as good as it gets?

20:01.030 --> 20:04.930
For us? Yeah.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.020
For now.

20:07.070 --> 20:11.760
Eventually, we... we grow up,
we get jobs, we have affairs...

20:11.800 --> 20:13.860
and we become alcoholics.

20:18.380 --> 20:22.370
Ahem. You know, sometimes...

20:22.410 --> 20:24.380
you depress me.

20:27.790 --> 20:30.250
Hey, that's what I'm good at.

20:39.660 --> 20:40.930
Give me that.

20:43.900 --> 20:46.340
Hey, isn't that
that Stall faggot?

20:46.370 --> 20:47.930
Yeah.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.600
You should go kick his ass.

20:51.640 --> 20:54.310
I'm going to.

21:12.600 --> 21:13.720
Who the fuck was that?

21:13.770 --> 21:16.860
I don't know,
and I don't want to know.

21:21.140 --> 21:23.900
Can I just say how sick I am
of these podunk towns...

21:23.940 --> 21:26.410
and the goddamn podunks
who live in 'em?

21:26.440 --> 21:29.040
Do you think
if you keep saying that...

21:29.080 --> 21:30.210
it's actually going
to change anything?

21:30.250 --> 21:32.550
I am so sick of this shit.

21:32.580 --> 21:37.210
Yeah, you made that clear
about ten thousand miles ago.

21:37.260 --> 21:38.380
Now, if you haven't got
a better idea...

21:38.420 --> 21:40.450
I don't want to hear
about it anymore.

21:42.190 --> 21:44.420
We are so goddamned broke.

21:44.460 --> 21:47.860
Yeah, well...

21:47.900 --> 21:49.870
that's easy to fix.

21:51.570 --> 21:52.900
No way.

21:52.940 --> 21:54.170
- Come on.
- Mm-mmm.

21:54.210 --> 21:56.140
Are you going to go shoot pool
with Jerry?

21:56.170 --> 21:58.400
Maybe.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.670
Thanks, Tom.
Thanks, Mick... good as ever.

22:00.710 --> 22:03.410
There you go.

22:03.450 --> 22:05.180
See you in church.

22:05.220 --> 22:06.810
Yep. Have a good evening.

22:06.850 --> 22:09.050
You, too.
See you tonight, Charlotte.

22:09.090 --> 22:10.950
Yeah. See you.

22:10.990 --> 22:12.890
Oh, I'm sorry.

22:12.920 --> 22:15.290
Aw, it's all right, old fella.

22:16.800 --> 22:19.460
Just closing up, fellas.

22:24.500 --> 22:27.440
Coffee, black.

22:27.470 --> 22:32.210
The same. I'll have some pie...
some of that lemon meringue pie.

22:32.240 --> 22:36.300
Guys, guys, I'm sorry. I'm...
We're closed.

22:37.480 --> 22:39.580
I said... coffee!

22:43.920 --> 22:45.910
OK.

22:47.290 --> 22:49.690
I guess we can handle that.

22:52.860 --> 22:55.200
It's not very fresh.

23:02.640 --> 23:04.610
You can go home now, Charlotte.

23:04.640 --> 23:07.510
Just leave the pie.

23:07.550 --> 23:09.540
OK.

23:14.950 --> 23:16.680
Billy...

23:23.530 --> 23:26.430
You're going to be sticking
around for a while, honey.

23:28.170 --> 23:29.660
Tom?

23:32.970 --> 23:36.700
Don't fuckin' move.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.750
Sir, we don't... we don't
carry much cash here.

23:48.790 --> 23:51.280
You gentlemen are certainly
welcome to all of it.

23:51.320 --> 23:53.880
Oh, I know that, asshole,
believe me.

23:53.930 --> 23:56.050
I do know that.

23:56.090 --> 23:58.150
- Aah!
- Shut up, bitch!

24:02.530 --> 24:04.630
OK, Billy...

24:04.670 --> 24:07.660
let's show this asshole
we mean business.

24:07.710 --> 24:09.800
What? Her?

24:09.840 --> 24:11.640
Yes, her.

24:11.680 --> 24:13.080
Do her!

24:15.910 --> 24:17.040
Aah!

24:27.130 --> 24:28.250
Uhh.

24:28.290 --> 24:29.850
- Aah!
- Uhh.

24:33.600 --> 24:34.900
Unh.

25:06.230 --> 25:07.930
I'm telling you,
those men were...

25:07.970 --> 25:09.490
They were going to kill us.

25:09.530 --> 25:13.370
They were going to kill us,
and if it weren't for Tom...

25:13.400 --> 25:14.430
He's a hero.

25:14.470 --> 25:17.840
...in conjunction with
several murders in those states.

25:17.880 --> 25:19.370
Now, Tom Stall
is a family man...

25:19.410 --> 25:21.780
with longstanding ties
to this community.

25:21.810 --> 25:25.040
Tom Stall
was just another hard-working...

25:25.080 --> 25:26.740
small business
owner and operator...

25:26.780 --> 25:29.380
in Millbrook, Indiana,
but now...

25:29.420 --> 25:34.550
Um, one of the guys
had a... a gun to my head...

25:34.590 --> 25:37.030
and Tom...
He was amazing. He...

25:42.400 --> 25:44.930
Hi, baby.

25:44.970 --> 25:46.990
- Hey, honey.
- How you doing?

25:47.040 --> 25:50.200
How are you?

25:50.240 --> 25:52.000
Uhh.

25:52.040 --> 25:55.640
Are you as sick of hearing
about me as I am?

25:55.680 --> 25:59.240
No, I kind of like it.

25:59.280 --> 26:01.840
Look.
Your picture's in the paper.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.370
Oh, God.

26:21.370 --> 26:22.570
Careful.

26:26.980 --> 26:29.470
- Hi, guys.
- Mom.

26:29.510 --> 26:33.040
Can I... Can I get up now?

26:33.080 --> 26:35.050
- You got it, Dad?
- Yeah.

26:35.090 --> 26:37.350
- Way to go, Tommy.
- We're all here for you, Tom.

26:39.490 --> 26:40.680
Way to go, Tom.

26:40.730 --> 26:43.890
- Hi, sweetie.
- Oh, that's so nice.

26:43.930 --> 26:47.760
Thank you so much for coming.

26:49.830 --> 26:51.630
We're in Millbrook,
just outside the home...

26:51.670 --> 26:53.760
of American hero Tom Stall...

26:53.810 --> 26:57.260
who's just now returning from
the hospital with his family.

27:00.140 --> 27:03.310
Mr. Stall,
Jenny Wyatt, WRPK news.

27:03.350 --> 27:06.150
I have a few questions for you.
How did it feel...

27:06.180 --> 27:08.120
when you saw the guns
of those ruthless killers...

27:08.150 --> 27:09.620
pointed directly at you?

27:09.650 --> 27:13.520
- How did it feel?
- Yeah.

27:13.560 --> 27:15.620
Not very good.

27:17.930 --> 27:19.660
Not very good.

27:19.700 --> 27:20.890
Were you surprised, though...

27:20.930 --> 27:23.130
by your own reaction
to the situation?

27:23.170 --> 27:27.370
Uh... what I did was...

27:27.410 --> 27:30.030
I mean,
anybody would have done that.

27:30.070 --> 27:33.570
It was just...
It was a terrible thing.

27:33.610 --> 27:37.050
I think we'll all be better off
when we get past it.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.740
Yeah, but you really went
beyond what the average...

27:38.780 --> 27:41.880
I... I need to... I really need
to be with my family.

27:41.920 --> 27:43.650
Thanks.

27:45.090 --> 27:48.350
I'm Jenny Wyatt in Millbrook,
and that was Tom Stall...

27:48.390 --> 27:51.950
American hero, man of few words.

27:53.230 --> 27:56.100
Well, I guess that's all
we're going to get.

28:00.770 --> 28:02.670
Man, it's good to be home.

28:02.710 --> 28:05.040
I hope there won't be
too much more of that.

28:09.980 --> 28:11.310
Hey, Dad, they all just
want to interview you...

28:11.350 --> 28:13.040
because of what you did.

28:14.050 --> 28:16.680
You're a hero, Dad. Ha ha!

28:16.720 --> 28:18.660
No, I'm not.

28:18.690 --> 28:21.020
I just got lucky... very lucky.

28:21.060 --> 28:22.120
This will all blow over...

28:22.160 --> 28:23.790
as soon as they find
some other hot story.

28:23.830 --> 28:28.060
Yeah. Maybe the Lydons will have
another two-headed cow.

28:28.100 --> 28:29.430
You guys
aren't thinking big enough.

28:29.470 --> 28:31.800
<i>You could probably do
Larry King Live, Dad.</i>

28:31.840 --> 28:34.770
- That would be cool.
- Oh, you stop it. Stop it.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.840
Look at this... more reporters.

28:37.880 --> 28:40.740
Are they still there?

28:40.780 --> 28:42.770
Yeah. Now there's some car
parked across the road.

28:42.810 --> 28:44.780
- They're just sitting there.
- Huh.

28:44.820 --> 28:46.940
- Does anyone want some tea?
- I'll take some, Mom.

28:46.980 --> 28:48.320
Yes, please.

28:48.350 --> 28:51.720
Unh. Aw, jeez.

29:10.210 --> 29:11.800
Hey, Edie.

29:11.840 --> 29:13.000
Hi. How are you?

29:13.040 --> 29:15.270
- Did you go to the shop?
- Yes, sir.

29:15.310 --> 29:17.370
Hello. Hey, Bill.

29:17.420 --> 29:20.320
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, baby. How are you?

29:20.350 --> 29:22.980
Oh, I'm all right.
What brings you by?

29:23.020 --> 29:24.390
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

29:24.420 --> 29:27.220
Doing good. Business is great.
Just can't keep up.

29:27.260 --> 29:29.230
Yeah, it's busy.

29:29.260 --> 29:33.060
Oh, look, more reporters. Nice.

29:33.100 --> 29:36.790
They don't look like reporters.

29:36.830 --> 29:39.430
Grilled cheese is ready.

29:39.470 --> 29:44.000
Got fries
and a strawberry shake.

29:45.810 --> 29:47.900
Hello. Welcome to Stall's.

29:47.950 --> 29:49.910
Would you gentlemen
like some coffee?

29:49.950 --> 29:52.380
You're the hero.

29:53.720 --> 29:56.020
Uh, I don't know, sir.
I was just...

29:56.050 --> 29:57.250
Nah, you're the big hero.

29:57.290 --> 30:00.590
You sure took care
of those two bad men.

30:00.630 --> 30:03.960
I really don't like
talking about it, sir.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.290
We're trying to get
back to normal here.

30:06.330 --> 30:08.390
So, can I offer you gentlemen
some coffee?

30:08.430 --> 30:11.030
Sure. Give me some coffee.
Make it black...

30:11.070 --> 30:13.900
- Yes, sir.
- Joey.

30:15.840 --> 30:18.570
And... and your friends?

30:18.610 --> 30:20.200
They don't drink coffee.

30:20.240 --> 30:24.410
It doesn't agree
with them... Joey.

30:25.880 --> 30:28.610
- Who's Joey?
- You are.

30:31.820 --> 30:35.280
- My name's Tom, sir.
- Of course it is.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.690
Mmm. That's good coffee.

30:46.370 --> 30:48.000
Thank you, sir.

30:48.040 --> 30:51.340
If I were to find coffee
as good in Philadelphia...

30:51.380 --> 30:54.240
but you know that,
don't you, Tom?

30:55.510 --> 30:57.280
Heh.

30:57.320 --> 31:01.450
No, actually, I don't.
I've never been to Philadelphia.

31:01.490 --> 31:04.280
Pennsylvania? Is that where
you gentlemen are from?

31:04.320 --> 31:07.420
Yeah, like you don't know.

31:08.590 --> 31:11.430
Sorry.
Did... Did we know each other?

31:21.170 --> 31:22.970
You tell me.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.380
No.

31:26.410 --> 31:27.900
We don't know each other.

31:27.950 --> 31:29.640
Come on, Joey. Cut the crap.

31:29.680 --> 31:31.150
My name is Tom.

31:31.180 --> 31:35.880
Joey Cusack.
Your name is Joey Cusack.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.290
You're from Philly.

31:39.620 --> 31:42.920
- Mm-hmm. OK. Whatever.
- Uh-huh.

31:44.660 --> 31:48.000
Excuse me, gentlemen, if you're
not going to order anything...

31:48.030 --> 31:49.160
my husband and I
would appreciate it...

31:49.200 --> 31:50.260
if you would be on your way.

31:50.300 --> 31:52.900
We ate on the road.

31:52.940 --> 31:54.960
It's all right.

31:55.010 --> 31:56.560
It's OK.

31:56.610 --> 32:01.940
We really are very busy here
today, as you can see.

32:01.980 --> 32:05.140
Um, so if you gentlemen
aren't going to be eating...

32:05.180 --> 32:09.280
I really should offer
your seats to paying customers.

32:09.320 --> 32:10.580
Hmm.

32:12.720 --> 32:14.090
Well...

32:17.730 --> 32:20.220
now we're paying customers.

32:21.900 --> 32:23.490
I can't take this.

32:23.530 --> 32:25.130
It shouldn't be
any problem for you.

32:25.170 --> 32:26.860
What is that supposed to mean?

32:26.900 --> 32:29.900
Mr. Fogarty's
just making conversation here.

32:29.940 --> 32:31.370
Well, whatever
you want to call it...

32:31.410 --> 32:33.040
this conversation is over.

32:33.080 --> 32:35.570
I think he wants us to leave,
Mr. Fogarty.

32:35.610 --> 32:36.810
Do you know what he does...

32:36.850 --> 32:38.470
when he don't like people,
Mr. Fogarty?

32:38.520 --> 32:40.110
Yeah. I'm scared.

32:40.150 --> 32:43.090
We should leave before he goes
all Dirty Harry on us.

32:45.960 --> 32:48.290
I want to thank you
for the coffee, Joey.

32:48.330 --> 32:50.950
It really is very good.

32:51.000 --> 32:54.160
It's Tom. My name's Tom Stall.

33:09.950 --> 33:11.740
Excuse me.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.880
What are you doing?
Who are you calling?

33:17.920 --> 33:21.920
Hi... Hi, Molly.
This is Edie Stall. Is he in?

33:21.960 --> 33:23.260
I'm fine, thanks.

33:23.290 --> 33:24.850
You're calling Sam?

33:24.900 --> 33:26.450
Yes.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.900
Is there a problem
with my driving, officer?

34:03.930 --> 34:06.400
Can I see your license, sir?

34:06.440 --> 34:08.030
Sure.

34:12.780 --> 34:15.300
I thought I was under the limit.

34:17.449 --> 34:20.080
Is there some problem
I should know about?

34:21.150 --> 34:23.120
What's your business
in Millbrook, sir?

34:23.150 --> 34:24.920
We're tourists.

34:24.960 --> 34:29.120
And what business did you have
at Stall's Diner today?

34:29.159 --> 34:31.360
We heard the coffee
was terrific.

34:31.400 --> 34:37.030
Let me make something clear
to you and to Mr. Mulligan.

34:37.070 --> 34:38.500
Uh-huh?

34:38.540 --> 34:41.060
This is a nice town.

34:41.110 --> 34:43.540
We have nice people here.

34:43.570 --> 34:45.770
We take care of our nice people.

34:45.810 --> 34:48.800
- Do you understand me?
- Yeah, sure.

34:50.110 --> 34:52.380
Don't let me see you around
again.

34:52.420 --> 34:54.880
You keep up the good work,
officer.

35:09.170 --> 35:11.030
Charles Roarke, Philadelphia.

35:11.070 --> 35:14.660
Indicted
on three counts of murder.

35:14.710 --> 35:17.670
Frank Mulligan,
out of New York...

35:17.710 --> 35:20.110
indicted on one count of murder.

35:20.140 --> 35:23.640
Questioned in relation
to dozens of acts of violence...

35:23.680 --> 35:26.280
that you don't want
to hear about.

35:27.350 --> 35:29.840
Both men work for Carl Fogarty.

35:29.890 --> 35:31.720
He's the fella with the eye.

35:31.760 --> 35:35.210
He spent fifteen years in prison
on several counts of assault.

35:35.260 --> 35:37.820
He's suspected
in half a dozen murders...

35:37.860 --> 35:40.230
and more disappearances.

35:40.260 --> 35:44.760
Tom, these guys are organized
crime from the east coast.

35:44.800 --> 35:47.770
Now, they're the real thing.
They're bad men.

35:47.810 --> 35:51.400
Jesus. Jesus, honey.

35:52.840 --> 35:55.370
I have to ask you a question.

35:59.150 --> 36:01.740
Are you in some kind
of witness protection plan?

36:02.850 --> 36:05.250
- Sam.
- Some kind of what?

36:05.290 --> 36:06.780
This is no laughing matter,
Edie.

36:06.820 --> 36:08.720
Of course he's not, Sam.

36:08.760 --> 36:12.090
I'd just like to hear
Tom say that.

36:17.900 --> 36:22.930
OK. No. No,
I'm not in a witness program.

36:22.970 --> 36:24.870
Those men just have
the wrong guy.

36:24.910 --> 36:26.970
They must've seen me on TV,
and I guess, uh...

36:27.010 --> 36:29.170
I reminded them
of this Johnny guy.

36:29.210 --> 36:31.200
- Joey.
- J-Joey somebody.

36:31.250 --> 36:34.910
I mean, good lord.
The idea of me...

36:34.950 --> 36:38.390
I never honestly believed it,
but I had to ask.

36:38.420 --> 36:43.660
I've done some research
on this, uh, Joey Cusack.

36:43.690 --> 36:45.890
I didn't find anything.

36:45.930 --> 36:49.420
But there is a Richie Cusack
in Philadelphia.

36:49.470 --> 36:51.660
Apparently, he's the head...

36:51.700 --> 36:55.700
of some kind of crime syndicate
in that city.

36:55.740 --> 36:59.200
Men like this come to our town
and start harassing a citizen...

36:59.240 --> 37:00.570
we have to take them seriously.

37:00.610 --> 37:02.270
Sure.

37:03.450 --> 37:06.710
All right. So, if you folks
see them coming around...

37:06.750 --> 37:08.080
you let me know.

37:08.120 --> 37:10.480
Will do.

37:10.520 --> 37:13.720
I'm sorry, Sam. Do you want
a piece of pie or something?

37:13.760 --> 37:15.190
Ah, no, thanks, Edie.

37:15.230 --> 37:17.990
I'd love to,
but I've gotta get back to work.

37:18.030 --> 37:19.830
Thank you. Thanks for coming.

37:19.860 --> 37:22.730
Uh, Sam? Thank you.

37:22.770 --> 37:24.860
It's good to know
you're watching out for us.

37:24.900 --> 37:27.500
Come on, Tom.

37:27.540 --> 37:29.940
You know we look out
for our own here.

37:29.970 --> 37:33.270
- Good night.
- Good night.

37:33.310 --> 37:35.470
See ya. Thanks.

37:45.890 --> 37:47.320
Huh.

37:51.260 --> 37:52.820
Don't worry.

37:54.470 --> 37:56.460
They're as good as gone.

38:02.870 --> 38:06.140
Sorry. Sorry.

38:10.180 --> 38:12.240
It's over and done with.

38:16.490 --> 38:18.110
OK.

39:20.050 --> 39:21.750
Honey. Can you get that, hon?

39:21.790 --> 39:23.980
Come on, come on!

39:27.830 --> 39:28.990
Hello?

39:29.030 --> 39:30.860
The shotgun, Edie!
Get the shotgun!

39:30.890 --> 39:32.420
Tom, Tom... Tom, what's wrong?

39:32.460 --> 39:33.950
They're coming to the house!

39:34.000 --> 39:35.260
Who's coming to the house?

39:35.300 --> 39:36.930
Just grab it!
Do it and be ready!

39:36.970 --> 39:38.130
OK, stop. Are you serious?

39:38.170 --> 39:40.330
I'll be there as soon as I can.

39:44.780 --> 39:46.270
Shit.

39:56.820 --> 39:59.190
Come on.

40:05.860 --> 40:07.490
Oh, shit.

40:09.130 --> 40:10.290
Oh, come on.

40:17.610 --> 40:19.270
Come on.

40:40.930 --> 40:42.490
Edie! Oh.

40:42.530 --> 40:45.630
Ohh, fuck. Tom!

40:47.170 --> 40:50.470
Tom. Tom, what's going on?

40:50.510 --> 40:51.630
- I...
- Huh?

40:51.680 --> 40:53.700
I... I don't know, baby.

40:53.740 --> 40:55.840
Jesus.

40:55.880 --> 40:58.070
What's going on?

40:58.120 --> 41:01.350
I don't... I don't know. Ohh.

41:01.390 --> 41:04.150
Let me call Sam, all right?

41:04.190 --> 41:06.020
- No, don't.
- OK.

41:06.060 --> 41:08.250
I... I don't even know...

41:08.290 --> 41:12.590
I... I don't know
why I thought... I...

41:12.630 --> 41:14.360
Mom?

41:14.400 --> 41:16.030
It's OK, baby.

41:22.070 --> 41:27.140
Yeah. Uh... ha ha. I...

41:27.180 --> 41:30.640
I... I... I think
I'm losing my mind.

41:30.680 --> 41:33.340
No, no, no. OK.
You're not losing your mind.

41:33.380 --> 41:36.350
You've been through
some serious trauma, all right?

41:36.390 --> 41:38.350
I'm here for you, baby.
We're all here for you.

41:38.390 --> 41:39.790
It's all right.
It's gonna be OK.

41:39.820 --> 41:41.590
Mom?

41:41.630 --> 41:44.750
You haven't forgotten about
my new shoes, have you?

41:44.800 --> 41:47.420
Gosh, no. It's my top priority
for the day.

41:47.460 --> 41:48.830
How could I forget?
You all right?

41:48.870 --> 41:51.630
Yeah, yeah. Hi... Hi, sweetie.

41:51.670 --> 41:53.600
Honey,
just get ready for school.

41:53.640 --> 41:55.260
I'll speak to you afterwards,
all right?

41:55.310 --> 41:56.800
OK.

41:58.080 --> 42:00.100
Come on.

42:00.140 --> 42:02.240
Let's go shopping.

42:17.760 --> 42:19.250
Hey.

42:20.830 --> 42:22.300
Careful. It's loaded.

42:34.710 --> 42:38.650
Why was Mom running
around the house with that?

42:38.680 --> 42:40.670
What's going on, Dad?

42:40.720 --> 42:43.280
False alarm.

42:43.320 --> 42:45.380
Nothing to worry about.

42:46.720 --> 42:48.350
<i>I am worried.</i>

42:48.390 --> 42:51.360
You're sweating.
You're soaked, Dad.

42:51.400 --> 42:53.120
What kind of false alarm?

42:53.160 --> 42:54.860
What did you mean,
you think you...

42:54.900 --> 42:56.370
You think
you're losing your mind?

42:58.200 --> 43:00.640
Some mob guys
showed up at the diner.

43:01.910 --> 43:07.100
They saw me on TV, and they
came by to take a look at me.

43:07.140 --> 43:08.940
Yeah.

43:08.980 --> 43:12.010
Yeah, I heard about that.
Uh, so...

43:12.050 --> 43:13.350
They thought they knew me.

43:15.250 --> 43:19.450
They thought...
I was somebody else.

43:19.490 --> 43:21.290
Heh. That's weird.

43:21.330 --> 43:24.560
Yeah. Weird.

43:24.600 --> 43:27.460
And I guess, um...
Well, I guess...

43:27.500 --> 43:30.160
they don't like this guy
they think you are.

43:32.170 --> 43:33.930
Apparently not.

43:33.970 --> 43:37.130
And, um, and I guess I...

43:37.170 --> 43:39.370
I guess... I guess they want...

43:39.410 --> 43:41.500
to kill this guy
they think you are?

43:41.550 --> 43:44.910
See, that's... that's
the losing my mind part.

43:44.950 --> 43:47.440
I mean, I have no reason
to think that.

43:47.480 --> 43:51.420
It's just I was down at work,
and, you know...

43:51.460 --> 43:56.220
suddenly I thought
maybe... maybe...

43:56.260 --> 43:58.820
they'd come looking around.

43:58.860 --> 44:00.160
You know?

44:03.100 --> 44:05.500
And, uh...

44:05.540 --> 44:08.660
And then you came running
back here to save us?

44:08.710 --> 44:12.330
Yeah, something silly like that.

44:13.640 --> 44:15.700
I'm sorry.

44:15.750 --> 44:18.610
What if you're right?

44:22.620 --> 44:24.750
Then we deal with it.

44:58.820 --> 44:59.980
OK.

45:15.840 --> 45:17.470
Now, look what I just found.

45:17.510 --> 45:20.570
It's my last pair in this style,
and it's exactly your size.

45:20.610 --> 45:22.840
Just try these on.
They should fit like a dream.

45:24.250 --> 45:25.710
How do they feel?

45:25.750 --> 45:28.550
Good. Yeah, I think I like them.

45:28.590 --> 45:29.980
I have a pair of these myself.

45:30.020 --> 45:31.250
They look great
and they really last.

45:31.290 --> 45:34.120
Really? OK. I'll take them.

45:34.160 --> 45:36.630
And I needed a pair
for her as well.

45:38.200 --> 45:39.990
Sarah?

45:43.600 --> 45:45.160
Sarah?

45:45.200 --> 45:47.070
- Uh, ma'am? The shoes...
- I have to find my daughter.

45:47.100 --> 45:48.540
I can't let you leave the store
with the shoes.

45:48.570 --> 45:51.040
OK, OK, OK. Sarah!

45:52.310 --> 45:54.400
Sarah?

45:57.350 --> 45:59.250
Sarah?

46:09.630 --> 46:13.760
Sarah. Sarah.
Don't ever do that again, OK?

46:13.800 --> 46:15.160
I'm sorry, Mommy.

46:15.200 --> 46:17.290
But look.
They have the new Vespa dolls.

46:17.330 --> 46:18.820
Nothin' to worry about,
Mrs. Stall.

46:18.870 --> 46:20.730
I've been watching over her.

46:20.770 --> 46:23.970
You stay the fuck away from
my family, you son of a bitch.

46:24.010 --> 46:28.000
There's no need for that kind
of language, Mrs. Stall.

46:28.040 --> 46:30.100
Listen to me.
I don't know what you want...

46:30.150 --> 46:31.550
and I don't really care.

46:31.580 --> 46:33.780
You should care about
what I want, Mrs. Stall...

46:33.820 --> 46:36.410
because I want something
from your husband...

46:36.450 --> 46:40.580
that might affect you,
might change your life.

46:40.620 --> 46:42.790
My husband does not know you.

46:42.830 --> 46:45.020
He wouldn't know you,
somebody like you.

46:45.060 --> 46:48.090
Oh, he knows Carl Fogarty,
all right.

46:48.130 --> 46:49.830
He knows me intimately.

46:51.400 --> 46:56.030
See? This isn't
a completely dead eye.

46:56.070 --> 46:58.400
It still works a bit.

46:58.440 --> 47:00.810
The problem is, the only thing
I can see with it...

47:00.840 --> 47:03.210
is Joey Cusack.

47:03.250 --> 47:06.010
And it can see
right through him.

47:06.050 --> 47:08.450
Right through your husband,
Edie.

47:08.490 --> 47:12.440
See what's inside him,
what makes him tick.

47:12.490 --> 47:14.580
He's still the same guy.

47:14.620 --> 47:18.750
- No.
- He's still crazy fuckin' Joey.

47:18.800 --> 47:20.520
And you know it, don't you?

47:20.560 --> 47:24.060
I know that my husband is
Tom Stall. That's what I know.

47:24.100 --> 47:25.430
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

47:25.470 --> 47:28.100
Well, why don't you ask Tom
about his older brother Richie?

47:28.140 --> 47:29.260
He doesn't...

47:29.310 --> 47:33.770
Ask Tom about how he tried to
rip my eye out with barbed wire.

47:33.810 --> 47:36.140
And ask him, Edie...

47:36.180 --> 47:41.880
how come he's so good
at killing people?

47:41.920 --> 47:45.820
If I see you within
five hundred feet of me...

47:45.860 --> 47:48.320
or my children or my husband,
I'll have you arrested.

47:48.360 --> 47:49.550
Heh heh heh heh.

47:49.590 --> 47:52.460
Can I possibly make myself
any clearer than that?

47:52.500 --> 47:56.260
No, no, Mrs. Stall, you can't.
I thank you for your time.

47:56.300 --> 47:58.820
You have an enchanting daughter.

48:00.370 --> 48:02.770
And, Mrs. Stall...

48:02.810 --> 48:04.970
don't forget your shoes.

48:05.010 --> 48:07.440
Heh heh heh heh.

48:07.480 --> 48:08.940
So, how's your dad?

48:08.980 --> 48:11.470
I don't know. A little weird.

48:11.510 --> 48:13.280
Well, after
what he went through?

48:13.320 --> 48:16.110
I mean,
actually killing someone?

48:16.150 --> 48:19.210
I mean, that's enough
to freak anybody out.

48:19.260 --> 48:21.880
Yeah. I guess.

48:25.560 --> 48:28.030
So, your old man's
some kind of tough guy, huh?

48:28.060 --> 48:30.190
What's he think
of his wimp son?

48:30.230 --> 48:33.330
You think he'd take this shit?
You think he'd make jokes?

48:33.370 --> 48:35.600
Go on, bitch.
Say something funny.

48:35.640 --> 48:37.270
Bobby, leave him alone.

48:37.310 --> 48:40.000
Shut up, skank.

48:40.040 --> 48:42.670
Uh-oh. He's gettin' mad.

48:42.710 --> 48:45.340
Jack, let's just
get out of here, OK?

48:46.580 --> 48:49.140
Jack, he's an asshole.
You know that.

48:49.190 --> 48:51.710
He doesn't mean shit.
Let's just go.

48:51.760 --> 48:53.620
Let's just get out of here, OK?

48:53.660 --> 48:56.680
Yeah, puss. Run away.

48:56.730 --> 49:00.130
Goddamn, I bet your daddy
would be real ashamed by you.

49:01.400 --> 49:03.460
Go ahead, bitch.
Say something funny.

49:03.500 --> 49:06.160
Make me laugh.

49:21.050 --> 49:23.710
- Uhh!
- Ohh!

49:23.750 --> 49:25.550
Uhh!

49:25.590 --> 49:31.030
OK, you motherfucker! Get
over there, you son of a bitch!

49:31.060 --> 49:32.220
Ohh!

49:32.260 --> 49:33.590
Come here. Are you laughin'?

49:33.630 --> 49:35.390
Are you laughin' now...

49:35.430 --> 49:39.990
you motherfucking
cocksucking piece of shit?

49:45.580 --> 49:47.410
What the hell were you thinking?

49:47.440 --> 49:50.610
- I wasn't thinking.
- Obviously not.

49:50.650 --> 49:54.240
Bobby's been riding me
all year, Dad. He's a jerk.

49:55.490 --> 49:56.610
He's a jerk?

49:56.650 --> 49:58.680
Yeah. He's a jerk.

49:58.720 --> 50:01.450
That's no excuse.
You stand up to him.

50:01.490 --> 50:03.120
You don't put him
in the hospital!

50:03.160 --> 50:04.290
Oh, big deal.

50:04.330 --> 50:07.130
It's the best thing
anyone could've done to him.

50:07.160 --> 50:08.960
Besides, I only got suspended.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.760
<i>It Is a big deal!</i>

50:10.800 --> 50:12.630
His parents say
they might sue us.

50:12.670 --> 50:14.530
There could be assault charges.

50:14.570 --> 50:15.730
We can't afford that, Jack.

50:15.770 --> 50:17.210
We don't have
that kind of money.

50:17.240 --> 50:19.400
Oh, what?
Mom's not gonna take the case?

50:19.440 --> 50:23.380
- Oh, whatever, Dad...
- Listen, smart mouth!

50:23.410 --> 50:26.540
In this family, we do not solve
our problems by hitting people!

50:26.580 --> 50:28.920
No, in this family,
we shoot them!

50:28.950 --> 50:30.080
Ah!

50:36.490 --> 50:37.860
Jack.

50:48.440 --> 50:51.270
Honey, have you seen Jack?

50:55.010 --> 50:56.500
What?

50:57.610 --> 50:59.670
What's wrong, baby?

51:03.490 --> 51:06.460
Fogarty and his men
followed us to the mall.

51:06.490 --> 51:07.980
He what?

51:09.990 --> 51:12.520
Call Sam.
Should... Should we call Sam?

51:12.560 --> 51:13.860
We should call...

51:13.900 --> 51:15.260
I already took care of it,
honey.

51:15.300 --> 51:17.860
I already took care of it.
Went down to the courthouse...

51:17.900 --> 51:20.030
got a restraining order.

51:20.070 --> 51:22.130
A lot of good that'll do.

51:22.170 --> 51:25.200
Well, it's something.

51:25.240 --> 51:27.070
At least
we could have him arrested...

51:27.110 --> 51:28.700
if he ever
comes around here again.

51:31.380 --> 51:33.440
You're right.

51:36.450 --> 51:38.220
But I have to tell you
something.

51:40.060 --> 51:41.220
What?

51:42.460 --> 51:45.920
This man Fogarty
really believes...

51:45.960 --> 51:50.460
that you're this Joey Cusack.

51:50.500 --> 51:53.490
I mean, the things that
he told me this afternoon...

51:53.540 --> 51:56.060
- What things?
- Things. Just bullshit.

51:56.110 --> 52:01.540
But he's, uh,
he's sure that it's you.

52:01.580 --> 52:04.240
And we have to convince him
that it's not.

52:04.280 --> 52:09.310
Well, I don't think he's
interested in examining my DNA.

52:30.110 --> 52:31.970
Get off our property.

52:32.010 --> 52:33.410
We'll go, Joey.

52:33.440 --> 52:35.430
We just want you
to come with us.

52:35.480 --> 52:38.610
Come back to Philly,
see some people.

52:38.650 --> 52:41.850
I told you, I have never been
to Philadelphia.

52:41.890 --> 52:45.080
Heh. You almost believe
your own crap, don't you?

52:45.120 --> 52:48.580
You know, you're trying so hard
to be this other guy.

52:48.630 --> 52:50.680
It's painful to watch.

52:52.500 --> 52:54.790
- Charlie.
- Hey.

52:54.830 --> 52:57.230
Look what we found.

52:57.270 --> 52:59.330
Come on.

52:59.370 --> 53:00.630
Yeah? Ha ha ha.

53:00.670 --> 53:02.160
- Mom!
- Jack!

53:02.210 --> 53:04.610
- No! Edie! Edie!
- Mom!

53:04.640 --> 53:06.610
- Edie! No! No!
- Jack!

53:06.640 --> 53:08.410
Let go, you son of a bitch!

53:08.440 --> 53:09.710
Come here.

53:11.650 --> 53:13.210
Wait.

53:13.250 --> 53:15.380
Mom.

53:16.520 --> 53:18.920
Don't make us hurt the kid,
Joey.

53:18.960 --> 53:21.250
We just want you to come
for a little trip with us...

53:21.290 --> 53:22.880
down Memory Lane.

53:22.930 --> 53:26.450
Put the popgun down.
Come over and talk to us.

53:26.500 --> 53:27.960
Baby, wait.

53:28.000 --> 53:31.430
Edie... I will get him.

53:31.470 --> 53:34.230
I'll get him. Please.

53:34.270 --> 53:36.140
Go up to Sarah.

53:36.170 --> 53:39.160
Go up to her. Do it.

53:47.580 --> 53:49.520
Put the gun down.

53:54.560 --> 53:57.120
Put it down, Joey.

54:01.860 --> 54:04.770
Come closer.

54:10.240 --> 54:12.230
A little further.

54:18.880 --> 54:20.280
Come on.

54:34.760 --> 54:36.990
Go back to the house, Jack.

54:40.740 --> 54:42.500
Go on.

54:52.620 --> 54:57.080
You see how cozy it can be
when you decide to play nice?

54:58.350 --> 55:00.580
Now, come on, Joey.
Get in the car.

55:00.620 --> 55:03.890
You won't need your toothbrush.
We'll take care of everything.

55:03.930 --> 55:07.160
I think it'd be better
if you'd just leave now.

55:12.670 --> 55:14.400
Joey.

55:25.080 --> 55:27.050
Come on, Joey, let's go.

55:31.750 --> 55:32.880
Ahh!

55:32.920 --> 55:34.910
- Uhh!
- Uhh! Uhh!

55:34.960 --> 55:36.550
Ohh! Ohh!

55:39.930 --> 55:42.020
Uhh!

55:42.070 --> 55:43.790
Tom!

55:49.170 --> 55:50.700
Fuck.

55:53.180 --> 55:54.800
Mommy, what's wrong?

56:04.020 --> 56:05.720
It's OK.

56:09.760 --> 56:12.420
You got anything to say
before I blow your brains out...

56:12.460 --> 56:14.050
you miserable prick?

56:16.300 --> 56:19.290
I should've killed you
back in Philly.

56:24.570 --> 56:27.410
Yeah, Joey.

56:27.440 --> 56:29.570
You should have.

56:39.490 --> 56:42.290
Uhh! Uhh.

58:10.010 --> 58:11.710
Edie.

58:19.090 --> 58:20.850
Honey, are you OK?

58:22.990 --> 58:24.790
Tell me the truth.

58:27.800 --> 58:29.490
The truth?

58:32.570 --> 58:35.500
Please.
You can do that, can't you?

58:38.940 --> 58:42.340
You can do that, can't you?
Please?

58:42.380 --> 58:44.610
What do you think you heard?

58:44.650 --> 58:47.580
It's not what I heard.

58:47.620 --> 58:49.210
It's what I saw.

58:53.290 --> 58:55.850
I saw Joey.

58:55.890 --> 59:00.120
I saw you turn into Joey
right before my eyes.

59:01.400 --> 59:05.030
I saw a killer...
the one Fogarty warned me about.

59:06.540 --> 59:10.730
You did kill men
back in Philly, didn't you?

59:12.640 --> 59:14.340
Did you do it for money...

59:14.380 --> 59:16.000
or did you do it
because you enjoyed it?

59:16.050 --> 59:20.110
Joey did, both. I didn't...

59:20.150 --> 59:21.580
Tom Stall didn't.

59:28.790 --> 59:31.120
Oh, God.

59:31.160 --> 59:32.650
Oh, my God.

59:43.870 --> 59:45.860
Oh, God, it's really happening.

59:45.910 --> 59:47.540
Oh.

59:48.880 --> 59:53.280
What are you, like, some
multiple personality schizoid?

59:53.320 --> 59:55.980
It's like flipping a switch
back and forth for you?

59:56.020 --> 59:58.710
I never expected
to see Joey again.

59:58.750 --> 01:00:01.550
Oh, yeah. Joey.

01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:03.580
What, was he in hiding?
Was he dead?

01:00:03.630 --> 01:00:05.360
I thought he was.

01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:07.260
I thought I killed Joey Cusack.

01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:09.260
I went out to the desert,
and I killed him.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:10.420
Oh, my God.

01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:14.960
I spent three years
becoming Tom Stall.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.030
Edie, you have to know this.

01:00:17.070 --> 01:00:20.700
I wasn't really born again
until I met you.

01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:23.880
I was nothing.

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:28.410
I don't believe you.

01:00:29.690 --> 01:00:31.680
I can't believe
this is happening.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:33.190
I can't believe
this is happening.

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:37.250
I can't believe
this is fucking happening!

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:41.660
You didn't grow up in Portland.

01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:44.890
And you never talk about
your adopted parents...

01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:47.330
because you don't have any!

01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:50.470
And our name.

01:00:50.510 --> 01:00:54.240
Jesus Christ, my name.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.840
Jack's name. Sarah's name?

01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:01.370
Stall? Tom Stall?

01:01:02.850 --> 01:01:05.750
Did you just make that up?

01:01:05.790 --> 01:01:08.260
Where did that name come from?

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.220
I mean...

01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:15.530
it was available.

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:17.030
Yeah.

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:29.840
I guess I was available, too.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.620
Hey, Jack.

01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:18.120
What am I supposed
to call you now?

01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:23.600
You're supposed to call me Dad.

01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:25.290
That's what I am... your dad.

01:02:25.330 --> 01:02:26.800
Are you really?

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:31.770
So, you're some kind of
closet mobster dad?

01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:34.000
I mean, if I go rob
Millikan's Drug Store...

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:37.310
will you ground me if I don't
give you a piece of the action?

01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:39.870
What, Dad? You tell me.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:42.150
Please, son. Don't.

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:46.640
If I talk to Sam about you,
will you have me whacked?

01:02:49.930 --> 01:02:51.620
Jack.

01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:54.210
Tom?

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:56.620
Hey, Sam. How are you doing?

01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:58.220
Good to see you up and around.

01:03:58.260 --> 01:04:01.390
- Yeah.
- You had her runnin' yet?

01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:03.630
Yeah, for a second there.

01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:06.160
She's coming back to life.

01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:09.100
Ah, shit.

01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:12.630
Tom...

01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:17.410
I got a problem.

01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:21.710
Want to come inside
for a minute?

01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:30.780
I've been running through it all
for the last couple days.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.560
It just doesn't fit.

01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:39.000
What doesn't fit?

01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:40.060
None of it.

01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:47.400
Is that Edie coming home?

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.270
Yeah.

01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:53.610
Well, we don't have
to do this now.

01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:56.850
Might as well.

01:05:01.690 --> 01:05:03.750
Hi, Sam.

01:05:03.790 --> 01:05:05.490
Edie.

01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:07.290
How you doing?

01:05:07.330 --> 01:05:09.560
I'm OK.

01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:12.800
You want some coffee?

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.430
No, I'm good.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.130
So, what brings you out here?

01:05:19.170 --> 01:05:22.110
Well, Tom and I
were just talking about that.

01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:25.480
Mmm. I'd like to hear it.

01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:29.580
Well, it's just that...

01:05:31.790 --> 01:05:32.980
none of this makes any sense.

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:34.790
Mmm.

01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:36.420
These are serious secretive men.

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:37.520
I mean, they wouldn't have
come out here...

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.050
they wouldn't have
gone through all this...

01:05:39.090 --> 01:05:41.620
exposed themselves like this...

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:44.500
unless they were dead certain
they had the right man.

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:49.130
So, what are you saying, Sam?

01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:56.140
I'm saying I think
I need to hear the truth.

01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:59.970
The truth?

01:06:04.450 --> 01:06:07.150
The truth.

01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:17.900
Sam, you've got
too much time on your hands.

01:06:19.070 --> 01:06:20.190
I'm sorry?

01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:23.800
Tom is...

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:27.070
Tom is who he says he is.

01:06:27.110 --> 01:06:29.600
That's all that really matters.

01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:33.710
Sam, hasn't this family
suffered enough?

01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:40.520
Well...

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.150
goddamn.

01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:47.190
Edie.

01:06:47.230 --> 01:06:48.590
It's OK.

01:06:51.330 --> 01:06:54.200
I guess I'll be going.

01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:02.940
You folks give me a ring
if you need anything.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:10.520
Anything at all, understand?

01:07:21.030 --> 01:07:23.190
Thanks.

01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:25.890
You...

01:07:27.570 --> 01:07:30.900
Edie. Edie!

01:07:30.940 --> 01:07:32.930
- Get off of me!
- Unh!

01:07:36.710 --> 01:07:39.840
Fuck you, Joey!

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.010
Aah! Get off!

01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:49.090
Uhh!

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.420
Uhh!

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.439
Ohh!

01:08:51.420 --> 01:08:53.450
Ohh. Ohh.

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:09.100
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:12.630
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:16.479
Mmm.

01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:39.970
Uhh.

01:10:34.990 --> 01:10:36.220
Uhh.

01:10:41.460 --> 01:10:42.830
Uhh.

01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:52.470
Hello.

01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:55.000
Hey, bro-ham.

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:57.940
You're still pretty good
with the killing.

01:10:57.980 --> 01:10:59.910
That's exciting.

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.310
Richie.

01:11:02.350 --> 01:11:06.190
Yeah, it's Richie.
What do you say, Joey?

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.210
Are you going to come see me?

01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:10.590
Or do I have to come see you?

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:41.540
What's that supposed to mean?

01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:48.910
Uh, Jenny Cream.

01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:50.920
Bottle.

01:14:31.690 --> 01:14:33.660
You Ruben?

01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:35.930
Yeah.

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:37.160
You Joey?

01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:50.500
Yeah, I'm Joey.

01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:55.410
So, what do we do now?

01:14:58.220 --> 01:15:00.420
You finish your beer...

01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:03.020
then I take you to see Richie
in the Escalade.

01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:27.150
Nice houses.

01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:30.350
Richie's
a very upscale kind of guy.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.470
Nice gate.

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:50.630
Yeah.

01:16:23.710 --> 01:16:25.070
We're here.

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:28.740
Home, sweet home.

01:16:58.410 --> 01:17:00.530
Got to frisk you.

01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:02.540
Nah. I'll save you the trouble.

01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:03.810
I'm not packing.

01:17:05.650 --> 01:17:06.880
I got to frisk you.

01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.650
All right.

01:17:11.690 --> 01:17:13.480
I don't smell very good.

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.580
I've been driving
pretty much non-stop...

01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:17.850
fifteen to sixteen hours.

01:17:17.890 --> 01:17:20.120
I'll hold my nose.

01:17:31.570 --> 01:17:34.370
Can you believe that place
is still standing...

01:17:34.410 --> 01:17:36.640
the Track and Turf?

01:17:43.250 --> 01:17:45.410
Didn't you bang
Jill Levy there...

01:17:45.450 --> 01:17:48.050
right on the bar
in front of everybody?

01:17:48.090 --> 01:17:50.720
I never banged Jill Levy.

01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:57.230
Well, you should've.
She was... She was something.

01:18:05.770 --> 01:18:08.400
How you doing, Richie?

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:14.810
Mmm.

01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:29.320
Yeah.

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:32.660
It's been a long, long time,
bro-ham.

01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:45.650
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.940
Come with me.

01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:03.560
- You want anything?
- Nah.

01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:11.400
So, you like that farm life?

01:19:12.810 --> 01:19:15.210
Milking cows and shit?

01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:18.300
I don't have a farm.

01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:20.440
No?

01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:24.540
Fogarty thought you lived
on some kind of farm.

01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:30.110
Said you could smell pig.

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:32.180
How that old fart would know...

01:19:32.230 --> 01:19:33.590
what a pig smells like,
I don't know...

01:19:33.630 --> 01:19:34.790
but that's what he said.

01:19:39.530 --> 01:19:41.500
Ahem.

01:19:41.540 --> 01:19:43.560
Do you like being married?

01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:45.370
What?

01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:47.500
Do you like being married?

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:52.040
Does it work for you?

01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:54.950
I can't see it working for me.

01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:57.250
I never felt the urge, you know?

01:19:57.290 --> 01:20:00.150
A lot of great looking women
in the world.

01:20:00.190 --> 01:20:04.560
I never met one made me
want to give up all the others.

01:20:04.590 --> 01:20:06.180
Sure, you can fuck around...

01:20:06.230 --> 01:20:08.630
but it's so much goddamn work,
you know?

01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:10.720
Keeping it quiet.

01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:12.790
It's not worth the effort.

01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:15.830
Don't see the upside.

01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:18.630
You see the upside, Joey?

01:20:19.710 --> 01:20:22.140
Yeah, Richie, I do.

01:20:23.510 --> 01:20:25.380
I do now.

01:20:27.250 --> 01:20:31.150
I'm pretty pissed at you,
bro-ham.

01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:34.650
You could've called.

01:20:34.690 --> 01:20:39.720
You could've dropped a postcard
in the mail.

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:42.730
We're brothers.
What'd you think would happen?

01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:59.570
I thought that business
would come first.

01:20:59.610 --> 01:21:01.510
Well, yeah.

01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:05.020
Yeah, I know.

01:21:05.050 --> 01:21:07.850
Tch. I know.

01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:12.320
What am I going to do?

01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:15.420
You bust up a made man's place.

01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:17.520
You killed some of his guys.

01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:20.030
You take his eye.

01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:23.730
Jesus, Joey, you took his eye.

01:21:23.770 --> 01:21:26.570
Barbed wire, wasn't it?

01:21:26.610 --> 01:21:30.170
That's disgusting.
You always were the crazy one.

01:21:30.210 --> 01:21:33.180
- Not anymore.
- Yeah, I heard.

01:21:33.210 --> 01:21:34.810
You're living
the American dream.

01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:36.820
You really bought into it,
didn't you?

01:21:36.850 --> 01:21:38.750
You've been this other guy...

01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:42.090
almost as long
as you've been yourself.

01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:49.020
Hey, when you dream...

01:21:49.060 --> 01:21:52.500
are you still Joey?

01:21:53.770 --> 01:21:55.930
Joey's been dead a long time.

01:21:55.970 --> 01:21:58.230
And yet here you sit...

01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:01.240
big as life.

01:22:04.210 --> 01:22:06.310
You know you cost me...

01:22:06.350 --> 01:22:09.810
a lot of time and money.

01:22:09.850 --> 01:22:12.410
Before you pulled that shit
with Fogarty...

01:22:12.450 --> 01:22:15.050
I was a shoe-in to take over...

01:22:15.090 --> 01:22:18.680
when the boss croaked...
a shoe-in.

01:22:18.730 --> 01:22:21.520
It was made very clear to me,
Joey.

01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.000
I had to clean up your mess...

01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:27.400
or nothing was ever
going to happen for me.

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:31.390
You got no idea
how much shit I had to pull...

01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:34.600
to get back in with those guys.

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:39.110
You cost me...

01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:45.340
a hell of a lot, Joey,
a hell of a lot.

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:50.090
Looks like you're doing
all right over here.

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:53.720
Yeah, I am, I am.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:58.130
I'm still behind
the eightball...

01:22:58.170 --> 01:23:00.000
because of you.

01:23:00.030 --> 01:23:02.030
There's a certain
lack of respect...

01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:04.600
a certain lack of trust.

01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:11.130
The boys in Boston are
just waiting for me to go down.

01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:19.880
You always were
a problem for me, Joey.

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:22.250
When Mom brought you home
from the hospital...

01:23:22.290 --> 01:23:25.050
I tried to strangle you
in your crib.

01:23:25.090 --> 01:23:28.460
I guess all kids try to do that.

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:30.460
She caught me...

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:33.800
whacked the daylights out of me.

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:36.570
I've heard that story.

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:42.500
Well, what do you think?

01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:49.050
Better late than never?

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:50.850
Richie...

01:23:52.750 --> 01:23:55.660
I'm here to make peace.

01:23:55.690 --> 01:23:59.460
Tell me what I got to do
to make things right.

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:03.820
You could do something, I guess.

01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:11.630
You could die, Joey.

01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:31.020
Ooh!

01:24:33.460 --> 01:24:35.090
Uhh!

01:24:35.130 --> 01:24:36.290
Uhh!

01:24:36.330 --> 01:24:38.030
- Unh!
- Oh!

01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:44.160
Oh!

01:24:44.210 --> 01:24:45.430
Uhh!

01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:49.710
Uhh! Ohh!

01:25:07.930 --> 01:25:09.620
How do you fuck that up?

01:25:10.670 --> 01:25:11.790
Uhh!

01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:15.860
How do you fuck that up?

01:25:33.490 --> 01:25:36.180
What are you going to do,
give him mouth-to-mouth?

01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:38.920
Did you see my brother?

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:40.190
Fuckin' leave this...

01:25:40.230 --> 01:25:43.930
and let's just kill
that little fuck!

01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:47.930
Jesus, Joey.

01:27:11.050 --> 01:27:13.380
Jesus, Richie.
