16:26.520 --> 16:27.520
You all are.

16:27.840 --> 16:30.000
Otherwise you wouldn't be here right now.
- NEARBY THUD

16:30.200 --> 16:31.759
The real danger isn't the creatures.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.719
It's the over-reaction to them.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.316
NEARBY BANG
- It's the way society's changed

16:36.920 --> 16:40.072
because of the way our fear
has been manipulated and used against us.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.192
NEARBY CLATTER
- That's why you're racing.

16:43.120 --> 16:45.589
And right now your only option
is to get back in the race.

16:46.480 --> 16:48.597
NEARBY THUD
- Cos it's the last chance you've got.

16:49.760 --> 16:50.910
THUD

16:51.840 --> 16:53.672
This place is overrun with creatures.

16:55.400 --> 16:58.438
How are we supposed to get back to our cars?
- No one said it would be easy.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.189
NEARBY THUD

17:01.440 --> 17:02.920
CLATTER

17:03.840 --> 17:05.115
THUD

17:06.880 --> 17:08.916
Yo, yo. I've... I think I got an idea,
you know.

17:09.240 --> 17:10.356

17:10.720 --> 17:12.757

17:14.760 --> 17:16.433

17:25.920 --> 17:28.310
Not just fast.
In that suit, he's indestructible.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.516

17:34.920 --> 17:35.956

17:36.800 --> 17:38.075
Well, there you have it.

17:38.240 --> 17:39.240
EL CAPITANO:
Fuck!

17:39.280 --> 17:41.795
Thanks to our feathered friend,
our course is clear

17:41.880 --> 17:44.031
for a final race to the finish.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.634
You couldn't have planned it better.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.836
You want to win, don't you?

17:49.880 --> 17:50.916
I can feel it.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.753
I'm only here for the shits and giggles.

17:55.040 --> 17:56.360
MAC:
Everyone out now!

17:57.160 --> 17:59.038
Look, don't worry.
I'm not going anywhere.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.715
I want you to deliver my baby.
Not here though.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.919
You're six centimetres dilated.
I think you need to stay where you are.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.601
You're gonna deliver my baby
in the back of the ambulance.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.116
And you're gonna drive.

18:12.880 --> 18:16.271
Would it make any difference if I told you
there is a significant risk

18:16.360 --> 18:18.800
there may be complications with this birth?
- None whatsoever.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.630
I will do whatever I have to to make sure
this baby grows up in a safe environment.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.115
So don't think for one second
I won't pull this trigger.

18:45.400 --> 18:46.993
I know it's none of my business, but...

18:47.800 --> 18:50.634
there's a spot out the back
where my wife is buried.

18:52.520 --> 18:53.520
I could...

18:54.560 --> 18:55.880
lay your daughter to rest there.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.240
If you wanted to keep going.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.436
JOKER:
All this time, I thought it was a joke.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.309
There's no punch line.

19:26.640 --> 19:29.109
That skinny little toe-rag is right.

19:30.160 --> 19:31.196
The world is fucked

19:32.200 --> 19:35.511
and it's gotta get a hell of a lot worse
before it gets any better.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.354
Well, come on, El Capitano.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.353
What the hell you standing around for?

19:41.920 --> 19:43.320
We've got a race to win.

33:10.720 --> 33:11.790
Go! Go!

33:16.640 --> 33:18.472
No!
- ROMAN GASPS

33:20.520 --> 33:22.193
SHE SCREAMS

33:23.800 --> 33:25.553
BABY CRIES

33:26.000 --> 33:28.834
MICHAEL:
He's alright. He's alright.

33:32.440 --> 33:34.193
JENNY GASPS

33:36.760 --> 33:38.956
THEY GASP AND LAUGH

33:43.280 --> 33:44.794
BABY CRIES

33:46.280 --> 33:49.956
OK. OK. He's alright.

33:53.400 --> 33:54.993
I'm gonna take you to Mummy now.

33:55.920 --> 33:56.920
Hi...

34:09.719 --> 34:12.554
APPLAUSE

34:44.679 --> 34:45.679
How does it feel?

34:46.760 --> 34:48.239
Pretty good, right?

34:48.320 --> 34:49.833
I bet it does. Good driving, kid.

34:50.400 --> 34:51.436
Thanks, Mr Larssen.

34:53.199 --> 34:54.873
This is my sister, Meg.

34:57.560 --> 34:58.560
She's adopted.

35:00.640 --> 35:02.154
Well raced, "Meg".

35:03.320 --> 35:05.080
My condolences for those who didn't make it.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.637
So, the island's real then?

35:10.920 --> 35:12.656
You don't mean to tell me
you came all this way

35:12.680 --> 35:14.512
without believing it existed, did you?

35:15.200 --> 35:16.200
W...

35:16.600 --> 35:17.920
My husband told me it was real.

35:19.680 --> 35:20.680
I wasn't sure.

35:21.280 --> 35:22.600
The island's real, Jenny.

35:23.720 --> 35:24.880
And I'm gonna take you to it.

35:34.040 --> 35:35.633
BABY GURGLES

36:07.600 --> 36:09.080
I think we bonded back there.

36:10.240 --> 36:11.310
Me and the little guy.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.518
I'd forgotten how good that feels.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.114
The sun on your face.

36:24.400 --> 36:27.472
Do you really think that we can do this?
After everything that's happened.

36:29.480 --> 36:30.480
Definitely.

36:30.560 --> 36:34.474
Going to Kiloran, attempting to synthesise
an antidote from your DNA...?

36:35.280 --> 36:37.480
Yeah, no, no, that's...
that's what I thought you meant.

36:43.720 --> 36:44.756
GUN COCKS

36:47.120 --> 36:48.156
Thanks for the bunny.

36:49.320 --> 36:50.320
But we're not done yet.

36:59.440 --> 37:00.560
JOKER:
What the hell is that?

37:01.360 --> 37:03.511
It's a complimentary box
for next year's race.

37:03.680 --> 37:04.680
Yeah?

37:05.240 --> 37:06.959
Why don't you stick it in your butt?

37:08.000 --> 37:10.037
THEY LAUGH
- Ohhh!

37:10.520 --> 37:12.193
THEY GIGGLE
- Oick!

37:12.280 --> 37:14.400
Shove it into the anus, y'know.
- Thank you very much.

37:14.520 --> 37:15.520
Anus time, y'know.

37:17.120 --> 37:18.270
I know how you're feeling.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.439
I was beside you every step of the way.

37:22.280 --> 37:23.280
I don't know...

37:24.040 --> 37:27.317
No, I'm certain. I don't think you have
any idea how I'm feeling.

37:27.880 --> 37:29.030
It hurts, doesn't it?

37:30.200 --> 37:33.716
But you have to remember,
it's not about how hard you fall.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.957
It is about how you pick yourself back up.

37:37.240 --> 37:38.240
Yeah.

37:39.680 --> 37:40.511
CHEESE:
Oh!

37:40.640 --> 37:43.280
Holy shit! Rum and Ribena...

37:43.320 --> 37:45.040
Why don't you pick yourself up off of that?

37:46.960 --> 37:47.996
MAN:
Up you get.

38:07.800 --> 38:09.678
I'm sorry, Faith. I can't...

38:10.400 --> 38:11.400
I won't do it.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.276
I made a vow,
to do whatever it takes to keep him safe.

38:15.080 --> 38:16.080
Not this though.

38:17.720 --> 38:19.120
I've seen what this world's like.

38:20.080 --> 38:21.355
I've seen the way it's heading.

38:22.120 --> 38:23.920
It's not a world I want my son growing up in.

38:25.880 --> 38:29.040
If you didn't feel the same way deep down,
you would've never entered this race.

38:30.280 --> 38:31.280
Look at him...

38:31.760 --> 38:33.035
he needs to be with his mother.

38:34.840 --> 38:35.840
He will be.

38:40.640 --> 38:42.711
LARSSEN:
Can I interest you in a consolation prize?

38:42.960 --> 38:44.280
No, we're good, thanks.

38:44.720 --> 38:46.040
Got better things to do.

38:57.680 --> 38:58.680
ROMAN:
Michael!

38:59.280 --> 39:00.280
Wait.

39:01.240 --> 39:02.240
Hey.

39:02.280 --> 39:03.396
Congratulations.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.549
Listen, there's something
I wanted to give you.

39:08.200 --> 39:10.157
Data I downloaded
from the Brookeheath server.

39:11.040 --> 39:12.076
It's all about you.

39:12.760 --> 39:14.035
That's how I knew who you were.

39:16.680 --> 39:17.840
MICHAEL:
My medical records...

39:18.200 --> 39:19.360
I thought it could be useful.

39:19.800 --> 39:20.800
It will be.

39:22.480 --> 39:23.630
We should get going.

39:26.440 --> 39:29.239
Guess you got the girl in the end.
- Yeah, speak for yourself.

39:31.280 --> 39:33.431
Come on. Come on!

39:41.880 --> 39:44.600
DOG BARKS

39:51.680 --> 39:52.680
Disappointed?

39:53.520 --> 39:56.115
Well, instead of going to a paradise island
in the Pacific

39:56.440 --> 39:58.716
we are going to a derelict medical facility.

39:59.640 --> 40:00.915
Why would I be disappointed?

40:18.680 --> 40:20.911
BABY GURGLES

40:21.400 --> 40:22.400
This is...

40:23.240 --> 40:24.240
Simon.

40:26.280 --> 40:28.158
We were expecting someone a little older.
