00:01.084 --> 00:02.927
<i>Previously on Hit the Floor:</i>

00:03.086 --> 00:04.588
You're hiding things from me.

00:04.713 --> 00:07.182
We don't have honesty,
we don't have anything.

00:07.299 --> 00:09.301
The "no pictures of your family"
thing?

00:09.384 --> 00:12.183
You said you and your mom were cool.
Were you lying?

00:12.304 --> 00:15.228
You're a good guy.
But I also know you're not my guy.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.851
Bye, Pete.

00:16.975 --> 00:20.400
I'm putting in new plays. You may
not be getting the ball as much.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.525
- When did you come up with this?
- It was brought to me.

00:23.649 --> 00:26.198
- German.
- As long as you're caught in the past,

00:26.318 --> 00:30.698
there's no future for you until you
admit how angry you are at your father.

00:30.822 --> 00:36.079
You're the one who let herself
get beaten over and over.

00:37.788 --> 00:41.759
Did you go see Olivia Vincent before
she died? What did she have on you?

00:41.917 --> 00:44.386
- She knew about the coke.
- She knew I got it.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.884
Oscar may be responsible
for Mia's death.

00:47.005 --> 00:49.554
There are files on every Devil Girl.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.718
I'm not gonna say anything
to anyone.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.498
Raquel.

01:14.741 --> 01:19.247
Oscar asked to see me, but he won't
say why. Know what might be it about?

01:19.371 --> 01:22.341
- I don't.
- You put those files back in his office?

01:22.499 --> 01:26.470
- Every one.
- Then I have no idea.

01:26.628 --> 01:29.757
I guess I'll just have
to face him blind.

01:36.013 --> 01:38.892
- Hey. You okay?
- Yeah.

01:39.057 --> 01:42.106
I found out I'm the honouree
at the Devils Roast this year.

01:42.227 --> 01:45.071
I've heard stories about Oscar's roasts,
urban legend.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.232
- That's a huge honour.
- Yeah.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.401
I'm not feeling like
being made fun of.

01:49.568 --> 01:53.618
- Why? Something going on?
- Why don't we ask this guy.

01:53.780 --> 01:56.533
- Ask this guy what?
- Why he's working overtime

01:56.700 --> 02:00.170
- to come up with plays?
- Hey, man, look, it's not personal.

02:00.329 --> 02:01.672
Why would it be personal?

02:01.830 --> 02:04.879
Look, I work for the team, not you.
And I'm about winning.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.298
Yeah.
Yeah, you should try that sometime.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.179
- Cool it.
- Tell him to cool it.

02:09.338 --> 02:11.386
You're not gonna back this dude
over me.

02:11.506 --> 02:12.974
Derek.

02:19.181 --> 02:21.604
I was starting to worry
you weren't coming.

02:22.225 --> 02:26.651
As you know, our next game is also
our annual Family Day,

02:26.813 --> 02:30.989
our way of counterbalancing
the unholy filth of the Devils Roast.

02:31.151 --> 02:35.748
I can't think of better ambassadors
for this year's Family Day

02:35.864 --> 02:38.743
than my in-house family,
the three of you.

02:41.078 --> 02:43.422
- We're not--
- You may not be conventional

02:43.538 --> 02:45.586
but the fans love your story.

02:45.749 --> 02:50.425
All it requires is walking on court
together, saying a few words.

02:50.545 --> 02:53.890
Basically, be the happy family
I know you are.

03:10.065 --> 03:15.287
Jelena, I'm gonna need you to oversee
last looks at the girls' dance tomorrow.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.324
I do that anyway.
Not that I don't trust your style.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.913
- More important things to do?
- Actually, yes.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.755
Oscar's asked Pete, Ahsha and me
to introduce Family Day.

03:24.913 --> 03:28.338
Riveting what passes
for a family nowadays.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.420
Maybe you should look into one.

03:35.340 --> 03:38.640
This week is extremely important
to me. I want you involved.

03:38.802 --> 03:41.772
- With Family Day? Of course.
- No, not that.

03:41.930 --> 03:44.228
You'll work with Raquel on the roast.

03:44.349 --> 03:47.319
- What do you need?
- The governor's confirmed to attend.

03:47.436 --> 03:50.406
We need to run background checks
on all Playground staff.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.695
Put together a list
so Jude can run point.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.659
I'll get it to you today.

03:54.818 --> 03:57.913
- What were you thinking for decor?
- I've got that covered.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.999
I was told to come see a man
about a horse.

04:07.539 --> 04:12.466
Tomorrow is the roast of Derek Roman.
I need it to look and feel over the top.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.088
Of course, I thought of you.

04:15.547 --> 04:17.970
I bring the party,
I don't decorate them.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.307
Can't you do both?

04:22.345 --> 04:25.849
This card has no limits,
so neither should you.

04:29.936 --> 04:33.691
You could've hired a professional.
Why'd you really ask me?

04:34.483 --> 04:36.736
I might be in the market
for a Girl Friday.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.112
Well, if this comes with the job,

04:39.237 --> 04:41.706
I can be your Girl Friday,
Saturday and Sunday.

04:48.163 --> 04:50.882
That week doesn't work.
I'm doing Fallon on the 24th

04:50.999 --> 04:53.593
and I have lunch with
Kathryn Bigelow on the 25th.

04:54.252 --> 04:58.052
I can't cancel on her again.
She is a scary woman.

04:59.049 --> 05:02.553
Yeah, the next week is better.
Thank you.

05:03.512 --> 05:04.889
Scheduling reshoots.

05:05.055 --> 05:08.309
Just when you think you're finished,
it's never quite over.

05:08.850 --> 05:13.356
Well, thanks for carving out the time.
The Devils Roast is tomorrow.

05:13.522 --> 05:18.369
I'm supposed to say something
biting about Derek. I don't bite.

05:18.527 --> 05:19.870
I recall differently.

05:21.571 --> 05:25.542
I've been giving myself an aneurysm
trying to come up with anything.

05:25.700 --> 05:29.455
This is way more up your alley, so any
chance you could help a guy out?

05:29.621 --> 05:31.965
- Let's see what you've got.
- All right.

05:32.123 --> 05:34.501
It's not-- Well, I mean...

05:40.340 --> 05:42.138
People say Derek's a ball hog,

05:42.300 --> 05:45.270
but it takes a lot of balls
to date the coach's daughter.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.889
That actually could work. I like that.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.441
You want to make the audience roar,

05:50.559 --> 05:53.984
we should go together. Was there
a bigger joke than our marriage?

05:56.731 --> 06:01.202
But, you know, going together
is not the worst idea in the world.

06:02.404 --> 06:05.999
- What do you think?
- I suppose not.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.164
What else you got?

06:11.621 --> 06:14.044
Is there anyone
who does know how to spell?

06:14.207 --> 06:17.837
Hayes. H-A-Y-E-S.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.927
You're looking even more tense
than usual.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.176
You end up at a fight club last night?

06:25.260 --> 06:27.058
Judging by how fast you hung up,

06:27.220 --> 06:29.723
I'm guessing you're scheming
on Ahsha.

06:30.265 --> 06:34.315
Judging by your mood,
I'm guessing it's not going so well.

06:35.395 --> 06:38.365
How hard is it to dig up dirt
on a 22-year-old?

06:40.775 --> 06:43.824
- Wrong Hayes.
- Mama Bear?

06:46.031 --> 06:47.874
Everyone knows she had a wild past.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.495
I want to know how wild it got.

06:53.580 --> 06:57.301
- What are you doing later?
- You are looking at it.

07:12.557 --> 07:15.185
- Why were you fighting?
- Your dude started it.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.859
He went to Coach with new plays,
cutting me out.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.773
My dad said German's good.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.945
If German's suggesting something,
it's because he has a good reason why.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.071
- I know why.
- German's not like that.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.039
He wouldn't do anything
to hurt you.

07:28.198 --> 07:30.917
No, punching me,
that was a trip to Baskin-Robbins.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.249
That was different and you know it.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.630
I'm not gonna treat someone
with kid gloves

07:35.747 --> 07:38.341
when they're coming at me.
Whose side are you on?

07:38.458 --> 07:42.179
I've always been on your side. Even
when people told me I shouldn't be.

07:42.337 --> 07:45.807
Even when I had to sneak around.
When it almost cost me my job.

07:45.924 --> 07:48.177
Put German on the other side,
what happens?

07:48.301 --> 07:51.350
I'm leaving before I have to take you
to Baskin-Robbins.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.815
- Go. Fine!
- I'm already gone.

07:59.896 --> 08:03.116
Derek, there's a lady at will call
saying she's your mother?

08:05.193 --> 08:08.242
- Hi, Coach.
- Hey, hey. How you doing, Desiree?

08:08.405 --> 08:11.329
Coach D!
How's joke-writing treating you?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.664
It's a work in progress.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.625
Can't you recycle jokes they used

08:15.704 --> 08:18.628
- when they roasted you?
- No. They never put me there.

08:18.790 --> 08:22.044
Back before the internet,
you could get into a kind of trouble

08:22.168 --> 08:24.091
that even Oscar
would not want aired.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.097
You're messing with me,
aren't you?

08:26.256 --> 08:28.099
Zero, you're a good Christian kid.

08:28.216 --> 08:31.311
I will not subject you
to Pete Davenport, The Blue Years.

08:31.469 --> 08:35.940
Proverbs 4:6:7.
"The beginning of wisdom is insight."

08:37.392 --> 08:42.523
You want insight? Let me tell you
about the '92 playoffs, okay?

08:47.110 --> 08:49.204
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but you need a ticket.

08:49.320 --> 08:52.540
- I don't need a ticket, I have a Devil.
- Mom?

08:53.283 --> 08:56.662
See, what'd I tell you?
They thought I was making it up.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.254
Hey!

09:00.331 --> 09:02.379
- Hi.
- Mom, what are you doing here?

09:02.500 --> 09:05.754
I know, baby, it's been a while.
I just thought I'd stop by.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.675
- Is that okay? I can come back--
- No, of course, of course, it's fine.

09:09.799 --> 09:13.053
It's just I've invited you,
like, a hundred games. It's just.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.644
You know, Coach is trying some
new plays this game. Why today?

09:16.806 --> 09:20.356
I wanted to introduce you
to somebody. Lloyd?

09:20.518 --> 09:23.738
Excuse me, excuse me.
Lloyd, this is my son Derek.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.615
It's a real pleasure, Derek.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.030
Your mother tells me
you're a supportive son.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.537
- Yeah, thanks for coming.
- No problem.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.747
Lloyd is in the car wash industry.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.207
That's an industry?

09:34.324 --> 09:37.453
Yeah. I'd love to franchise car washes
with your name on it.

09:37.577 --> 09:40.751
Call it "The Roman Baths."
Import soap from Italy, the works.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.633
Yeah, I usually let my business
manager handle that.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.673
You should probably get his name.

09:45.835 --> 09:49.760
- Smart, that's right.
- Derek is a one-man dunk contest.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.596
Wait 'til you see how he scores.

09:51.716 --> 09:54.139
I mean, it's gonna blow you away,
right, baby?

09:54.677 --> 09:58.682
- Yeah. Yeah, it'll be great.
- Look at all these fans.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.852
- Hi.
- Man, Derek Roman. In the flesh.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.774
Can we get a beer before we go in?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.527
You ready to be
the Partridge family?

10:06.689 --> 10:09.533
The father in the Partridge family
was dead.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.779
- Ladies and gentlemen,
- Here we go.

10:12.904 --> 10:16.750
Please draw your attention to centre
court for this special announcement.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.539
See?

10:24.040 --> 10:30.298
Hi, I'm Devil Girl Ahsha Hayes, and this
is my dad, Coach Pete Davenport,

10:30.421 --> 10:33.425
and my mom,
Devil Girl director Sloane Hayes.

10:33.591 --> 10:37.346
We know how special it is that you
all brought your families here today.

10:37.512 --> 10:40.891
- So from our--
- So from our family-- Is it?

10:41.057 --> 10:43.685
- No, sorry.
- So from our family to your family,

10:43.852 --> 10:46.321
- thanks for coming.
- She stole my line.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.732
- You stole my line.
- You were messing up.

10:48.857 --> 10:51.235
You did mess it up, you.

10:51.359 --> 10:54.112
- No, you didn't!
- It's getting in my hair!

10:54.279 --> 10:57.749
- She didn't get that arm from me.
- I'll eat it, I'll eat it.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.877
Hey, enjoy Family Day.
Don't throw popcorn at each other

11:00.994 --> 11:03.417
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

11:06.332 --> 11:09.381
Ladies and gentlemen,
please put your hands together

11:09.502 --> 11:13.382
for your Los Angeles Devil Girls!

13:44.907 --> 13:46.875
This throne needs to hit the ceiling.

13:46.993 --> 13:50.088
I want Derek Roman to look like
he got shrunk in the wash.

13:50.246 --> 13:54.001
Spray gold?
Oh, no, darling, I want actual gold.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.129
Oh, just charge it to the card.

13:58.755 --> 14:02.635
You do realise you're on national
television talking on the phone?

14:02.800 --> 14:06.100
- Where do you even keep that thing?
- Oh, I've got places.

14:06.220 --> 14:09.064
I have no time to plan the
awesomeness I have in store

14:09.140 --> 14:10.608
for your man.

14:10.767 --> 14:15.318
He's not really in an awesome place.
We had a fight last night.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.950
And hot make-up sex
this morning based on that hickey.

14:19.484 --> 14:21.862
Whatever good that did
went out the window

14:22.028 --> 14:26.750
- as soon as Derek's mom showed up.
- Mary Roman's here? This is perfect.

14:26.866 --> 14:29.164
I'm putting together
a Baby DeRo slide show.

14:29.327 --> 14:32.422
- She's gotta have embarrassing pics.
- Wouldn't bet on it.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.917
She didn't raise him.
She left him with his grandparents.

14:36.084 --> 14:38.132
She was in and out.

14:38.753 --> 14:40.755
That's her right there.

14:43.508 --> 14:46.603
- Two minutes left in the first quarter.
- Come on, Devils!

14:46.719 --> 14:50.815
Zero enters the front court.
Passes it to Fahie. There's Derek.

14:53.017 --> 14:56.021
Not a lot of action tonight,
Derek wide open.

14:56.187 --> 14:59.236
Pass goes by him,
right back to Zero.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.864
Zero shoots!

15:03.027 --> 15:07.828
Smooth! Another two.
Devils 27, Miami 16.

15:07.949 --> 15:09.792
Three minutes left before halftime.

15:09.951 --> 15:13.922
Jerry, I gotta tell you, looks like the
Devils are running some new plays.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.003
Miami doesn't seem too happy
with it.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.126
I'll tell you what.
Neither does Derek.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.471
A lot of action tonight,
a lot of movement.

15:23.256 --> 15:27.386
Zero, he's on the move.
Slices through the lane, scores again!

15:27.552 --> 15:31.102
Devils now at 55, <i>27</i> for Miami.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.524
Here we are
midway through the third quarter.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.484
- Come on.
- A lot of pressure here.

15:35.601 --> 15:38.024
I did not expect things
would go like they are

15:38.104 --> 15:40.653
and I gotta tell you,
as surprised as I am

15:40.815 --> 15:43.318
the fans here
seem even more surprised.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.452
Derek's open.
Zero back to Fahie.

15:45.611 --> 15:49.457
- Pass, pass!
- Zero's got it, takes it to the hoop!

15:49.615 --> 15:52.084
Zero taking full advantage,
making it look easy.

15:52.201 --> 15:57.048
L.A. 68, Miami 60.
What a game, what a game!

15:57.206 --> 16:01.177
What an outstanding individual effort.
Zero has been on fire tonight.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.632
Got that right.

16:02.795 --> 16:07.301
Zero getting two more points,
bringing his team-high total to 22.

16:07.425 --> 16:12.226
And there's the final buzzer.
The Devils win, 103 to 93.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.561
Yes.

16:16.434 --> 16:21.440
- You guys were great tonight.
- Thanks. I'll catch you later, okay?

16:22.773 --> 16:24.946
- That was ridiculous.
- We won by ten.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.988
- I looked like a chump.
- It's not about how you look.

16:28.112 --> 16:32.242
It's about how we do.
You're on a team, remember?

16:37.371 --> 16:39.794
I do have a decent
future father-in-law joke.

16:39.916 --> 16:43.466
My daughter married to Derek.
That's not a joke, that's a nightmare.

16:43.628 --> 16:47.303
You could do worse for a son
than a multi-million dollar baller.

16:47.381 --> 16:51.261
- Is that what you told your parents?
- Before you, I dated Nicolas Cage.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.472
My parents had nothing
to say about you.

16:53.638 --> 16:57.438
Yeah, yeah, that's before I started
drunk driving kids all over town.

16:57.600 --> 17:01.730
- What are you talking about?
- That's what Raquel accused me of.

17:01.896 --> 17:04.740
I had a drink hours before
I went to pick up Miguel

17:04.898 --> 17:07.823
and suddenly she's labelling me
an After School Special.

17:07.902 --> 17:09.494
That's why we broke up.

17:10.445 --> 17:13.165
I was in an After School Special
with Crispin Glover

17:13.281 --> 17:16.205
and the daughter from
Mr. Belvedere. That was tragic.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.800
Don't mind me, y'all.

17:34.095 --> 17:37.315
Raquel. Has Oscar given you
his guest list?

17:37.473 --> 17:41.774
His roasts are filled with heavyweights.
I bet a few are tied to the new arena.

17:41.936 --> 17:45.190
He sent it an hour ago.
I was just starting to look through it.

17:47.900 --> 17:52.906
B Waxier. I recognise that name.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.704
It was on a form in Mia's file.

17:55.825 --> 17:59.500
He called and confirmed this afternoon.
He'll be here tomorrow night.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.372
Then so will I.

18:06.002 --> 18:10.007
- Have I got something for you.
- If it's what I think it is...

18:10.172 --> 18:13.642
Oh, you're gonna want it
when I tell you.

18:14.468 --> 18:18.348
I had an enlightening conversation
with Pete about his past party days.

18:18.514 --> 18:21.267
Specifically about one wild
early '90s mansion party.

18:21.434 --> 18:25.610
Pete Davenport with frosted tips.
I care because--

18:25.771 --> 18:28.900
It was one of his low moments,
which means...

18:29.025 --> 18:32.154
- It was one of Sloane's low moments.
- You want it now?

18:32.278 --> 18:34.076
The same person own that mansion?

18:34.196 --> 18:37.791
He does and Hank has informed me
he loves having company.

18:42.538 --> 18:45.587
Oh, I needed a moist towelette
after I got that call.

18:45.750 --> 18:50.472
The chance to host the Devils again.
Are you kidding me?

18:50.630 --> 18:53.554
In the old days,
when the Devils were champs,

18:53.716 --> 18:57.311
the wins were like aphrodisiacs.
Every player turned up here.

18:57.470 --> 19:02.567
- Pete Davenport?
- Definitely Davenport. So virile.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.773
Oh, the body on that one.

19:04.935 --> 19:08.906
We were hoping to hear
about one special party.

19:09.023 --> 19:11.526
Think "Caligula" on acid.

19:12.485 --> 19:17.082
What you're looking for is depravity.
My strongest suit.

19:44.392 --> 19:46.736
The composition of this one
is fascinating.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.940
I'd love a copy.

19:51.941 --> 19:57.072
I can't imagine parting with it.
These are my private selections.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.074
I could possibly make an exception

20:01.909 --> 20:04.788
if I were able to add a new one
to my gallery.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.665
Strictly for my personal enjoyment,
of course.

20:09.417 --> 20:12.466
- That's not possible.
- Okay.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.090
I'll do it.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.388
That works.

20:24.181 --> 20:27.060
You know I'm not just talking
about shirtless.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.312
Oh, I know.

20:40.906 --> 20:42.499
Raquel.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.460
Hey, I saw the list
of employees

20:45.619 --> 20:50.090
and noticed one name
was missing. Yours.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.502
I guess I was so focused
on everyone else--

20:52.585 --> 20:54.258
It's fine. I'll have you added.

20:55.838 --> 20:59.934
Actually, it wasn't entirely a mistake.

21:00.092 --> 21:03.938
So embarrassing, I just,
I have a ton of parking tickets

21:04.096 --> 21:05.894
and I could risk
the embarrassment

21:06.056 --> 21:09.981
but if I get pulled from the party
over it, the roast would fall apart.

21:10.102 --> 21:15.484
- Oscar wouldn't like that very much.
- I don't want to give him the headache.

21:15.649 --> 21:19.244
- I think we can leave your name off.
- Thank you.

21:28.788 --> 21:32.588
Mrs. Roman, hi.
I didn't know you were--

21:32.750 --> 21:35.845
- I'm Derek's girlfriend, Ahsha.
- Hi.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.926
- Come on in.
- Okay, thank you.

21:38.088 --> 21:40.261
Derek's with his trainer.
Let me call him.

21:40.341 --> 21:43.845
Oh, no, don't worry about that.
I just wanted him to sign this.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.516
Oh, okay. Who's it for?

21:45.679 --> 21:49.650
SportsCollectibles.com.
One of those is a Louis bag.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.525
Okay, I'll make sure
he brings it tonight.

21:53.687 --> 21:55.985
Oh, about tonight.
I told Derek I was coming

21:56.065 --> 21:58.909
but something else came up.
Can you tell him for me?

21:59.068 --> 22:01.867
I could, but are you sure
you can't make it?

22:02.029 --> 22:03.622
Even...

22:03.739 --> 22:06.868
Even forjust a little bit?
This is a huge honour for Derek.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.832
Oh, there'll be plenty of people.

22:08.953 --> 22:11.331
I'm sure he won't even notice
I'm not there.

22:11.455 --> 22:14.925
It's just, I really think that's not true.

22:15.084 --> 22:18.133
He's loved having you there
for other stuff, right?

22:18.254 --> 22:21.804
His trophy case is filled with
junior high and high school trophies.

22:22.675 --> 22:27.522
Yeah, you know, in the sixth grade,
his team won the state championship.

22:27.680 --> 22:31.605
He was the only one who wore a suit
and tie to the ceremony. He insisted.

22:33.561 --> 22:35.484
I know there were others.

22:39.400 --> 22:43.906
Mrs. Roman, Derek might not say it,

22:44.071 --> 22:50.704
but you're a big part of his life,
even if you aren't a big part of his life.

22:54.915 --> 22:58.010
- What's the dress code?
- Cocktail.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.299
All right.

23:06.552 --> 23:07.895
I'm gonna keep it quick.

23:08.053 --> 23:11.478
I had no business coming at you
like that in public. I'm sorry.

23:11.599 --> 23:14.523
- Apology accepted.
- We have history out of the arena.

23:14.685 --> 23:16.983
I need to accept
that this will happen.

23:17.104 --> 23:21.860
This is 100 percent about the game.
These new plays, they work.

23:21.984 --> 23:23.486
They worked great for Ohio.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.414
Ohio.

23:30.576 --> 23:33.955
I gotta go.
Look, sorry again about earlier.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.421
You must want these women
gone pretty bad

23:41.587 --> 23:46.468
- to get your hands dirty like this.
- Hands dirty? I didn't do a thing.

23:46.634 --> 23:51.606
No, I did.
You got me on the Sloane trail.

23:51.764 --> 23:56.986
You got me to get naked for this photo.
You got me to do your dirty work.

23:57.102 --> 24:00.697
Now that you've got what you
were after, what are you gonna do?

24:02.358 --> 24:05.828
The question and answer portion
of this programme is over.

24:16.246 --> 24:17.748
<i>- HEY-
- HEY-</i>

24:17.915 --> 24:20.509
I just got the footage of us
from Family Day

24:20.626 --> 24:23.846
- so I thought I'd drop off a copy.
- Oh, man.

24:24.004 --> 24:26.382
I have a few extra minutes.
Come on, sit down.

24:26.507 --> 24:30.228
- We can watch it together.
- Okay.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.395
- I'm not sure I really want to see this.
- I know.

24:42.398 --> 24:46.653
Cue bumbling dad. What?
I don't even know.

24:46.819 --> 24:49.368
Well, come on.
It was only a matter of time

24:49.488 --> 24:52.287
before Ahsha was embarrassed
by her mother and father.

24:52.449 --> 24:53.871
Yeah.

24:54.576 --> 24:56.328
She is.

24:58.247 --> 25:00.921
I'm glad we have this on tape.

25:02.084 --> 25:03.802
Me too.

25:31.739 --> 25:35.710
- I should probably...
- Yeah, me too.

25:36.452 --> 25:38.705
- Okay-
- okay-

25:54.887 --> 25:59.893
You look so pretty.
Thanks for coming.

26:03.312 --> 26:06.316
It's like Spartacus vomited
on Super Fly.

26:07.608 --> 26:11.363
- Isn't it beautiful?
- It's the height of taste and class.

26:13.697 --> 26:18.419
Have fun. Thanks for coming tonight.
You're gonna be sitting at table five.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.080
- I sat you beside him.
- Okay.

26:32.758 --> 26:35.637
- Brandt Waxier.
- Sloane Hayes.

26:44.269 --> 26:47.694
Hi. I'm glad you came.
I thought you might not.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.984
Because of what happened
with Derek.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.828
It's cool. Look, I'm just here
to enjoy the roast.

26:52.945 --> 26:57.701
Okay. Good. It's just.
Derek's been super stressed lately.

26:57.825 --> 26:59.702
Not that you need to know that,

26:59.827 --> 27:03.081
but I just wanted to say sorry
if he took it out on you.

27:03.247 --> 27:05.966
- Ahsha, would you stop?
- Stop what?

27:06.125 --> 27:10.505
Apologising. Checking in on me.
Asking about my feelings.

27:13.090 --> 27:15.718
I get what you think
you're trying to do, okay?

27:15.884 --> 27:18.433
But all you're doing
is keeping me in your drama.

27:18.595 --> 27:20.723
- I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

27:21.890 --> 27:25.235
You've gotta see the mixed
messages you're sending.

27:26.311 --> 27:29.281
Look, you moved on. I've moved on.

27:29.439 --> 27:32.864
We're not in each other's lives
anymore. Not like that.

27:35.112 --> 27:37.456
You've moved on?
You're seeing someone?

27:37.614 --> 27:41.960
No. But I'm not sitting at home waiting
for you to come back like a monk.

27:45.080 --> 27:49.301
Look, we don't need to keep having
these same conversations, okay?

27:54.506 --> 27:56.679
He's coming, he's coming.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.106
<i>Hey-</i>

28:11.356 --> 28:13.609
- Girls.
- All right, y'all.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.743
It's time to get this party started.

28:15.861 --> 28:20.492
Put your hands together for the man
of the hour, Derek Roman!

29:16.546 --> 29:18.719
Don't worry. She'll be here.

29:32.104 --> 29:35.699
I'm Sommore and I'm glad to see
that you all made it out.

29:35.857 --> 29:40.078
I'm guessing that you all were afraid
to turn down Oscar's invitation

29:40.988 --> 29:43.332
lest you turn up underneath
his next arena.

29:44.700 --> 29:50.207
Oh, is it too soon for that?
Okay, I'm dead wrong for that one.

29:51.123 --> 29:55.720
Okay, we're here tonight
to honour Derek Roman.

29:57.879 --> 30:00.632
Let's give it up for the man of the hour.

30:03.510 --> 30:07.060
Or, as most women call him,
the man of 27 seconds.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.317
Okay, by a show
of venereal diseases

30:11.476 --> 30:15.982
how many people in here have
crowned the Roman Emperor?

30:16.106 --> 30:18.404
Okay, penicillin for you, penicillin...

30:19.568 --> 30:23.289
So club promoting?
That's interesting work.

30:23.447 --> 30:26.826
Yeah. I've hired your Devil Girls
a couple of times.

30:28.285 --> 30:30.754
Is that how you met Oscar,
through your clubs?

30:30.912 --> 30:33.711
I've been trying to get Oscar
to buy a club for years.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.051
He tells me the Playground's
all he needs.

30:36.209 --> 30:39.463
I'll get him to do business with me
at some point.

30:39.629 --> 30:41.381
How thin are you girls gonna get?

30:41.506 --> 30:44.806
I mean, y'all getting ready
to disappear. I'm gonna talk fast.

30:44.926 --> 30:48.305
And what's up with the togas?
I mean, it's not covering anything.

30:48.472 --> 30:51.521
Kind of like the Devils' defence,
lguess.

30:53.226 --> 30:55.228
Okay, well, I mean.
Well, I'm kidding.

30:55.354 --> 30:58.449
I mean, we all know that
the Devils don't have a defence.

30:59.316 --> 31:03.116
Okay, so where is the queen bee?

31:03.278 --> 31:06.157
Jelena Howard. Where is she at?

31:06.323 --> 31:09.543
This girl is so tiny I can't even see her.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.756
It's going great.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.757
Thanks for covering me
with that ticket thing.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.224
No problem.

31:26.176 --> 31:28.929
You're really nothing like your dad.

31:29.054 --> 31:31.398
What do you know about Oscar?

31:34.101 --> 31:37.480
Oh, nothing. I was just...

31:37.646 --> 31:40.240
I really don't know why I said that.

31:40.357 --> 31:41.904
Okay.

31:42.067 --> 31:46.197
Oscar Kincade, wow.

31:46.363 --> 31:50.789
Damn, this man has a lot of money.
Some of it's his too.

31:50.951 --> 31:52.669
My wedding dress is in my trunk.

31:52.744 --> 31:56.840
I can throw it on for a quick laugh
if you start to bomb up there.

31:59.501 --> 32:03.847
You have been such a help
and not just today.

32:04.631 --> 32:10.309
But I feel like I owe it to you
to tell you

32:10.470 --> 32:13.815
my feelings about us
haven't changed.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.481
Well, ladies,
I mean, don't be judgmental.

32:17.602 --> 32:20.981
I heard he's a Christian man.
Spends a lot of time praying.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.575
If you ask me,
that's the best kind of man

32:23.733 --> 32:25.861
that spends a lot of time
on his knees.

32:28.155 --> 32:32.285
So I hope y'all are having a good time.
But how about last night's game?

32:32.451 --> 32:36.126
Haven't seen DeRo get that little
bit of action since he had the clap.

32:38.081 --> 32:42.461
But I'm glad to see that Derek
is using his clap in a positive way.

32:42.586 --> 32:46.636
I mean, y'all seen him out there
applauding for Terrence and Zero.

32:47.716 --> 32:50.515
I see you back there laughing.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.771
After last night,
the Devils are thinking about

32:56.933 --> 33:00.983
renaming the Roman Emperor
the Billion-Dollar BJ.

33:01.104 --> 33:05.951
I mean, he never handled any balls.
He just got paid a lot to suck.

33:09.029 --> 33:11.373
You wanna laugh, go ahead.
Laugh now.

33:13.158 --> 33:15.911
Matt 5:22. Anyone who
is angry with his brother

33:16.036 --> 33:17.709
will be subject to judgment.

33:17.829 --> 33:19.877
- Shut your mouth.
- That's enough.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.467
I've had enough
of you backing everyone else.

33:22.542 --> 33:25.762
- I'm backing people helping me win.
- He's not here to help.

33:25.879 --> 33:28.177
You've been staring
at that chair all night.

33:28.298 --> 33:32.144
Whatever your deal is with
your mother, you need to grow up.

33:37.307 --> 33:39.150
Derek!

33:42.395 --> 33:46.195
Look, I'm leaving.
Are you coming or staying?

33:55.742 --> 33:58.712
It's not a party
till someone clears a table.

33:58.870 --> 34:02.249
Fight notwithstanding,
nice work tonight, Kyle.

34:02.415 --> 34:06.716
And nice dress. I assume
it also made its way to the card.

34:06.878 --> 34:09.380
I'm a part of the decorations.

34:09.547 --> 34:13.518
- I could get used to this kind of dough.
- I think you should.

34:13.677 --> 34:17.898
Word on the street is you like
to keep track of high rollers.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.650
These guys are as high up as it gets.

34:24.728 --> 34:26.606
Why are you giving this to me?

34:26.773 --> 34:30.402
There may come a future time
when I could use your talents.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.411
How does that sound?

34:33.947 --> 34:36.324
You got yourself a deal.

34:48.962 --> 34:51.511
I talked to Waxier.

34:52.549 --> 34:55.643
He had a good reason
for being in Mia's file.

34:55.802 --> 34:59.181
- So it's a dead end?
- Red wine, please?

34:59.973 --> 35:02.351
I thought so.

35:02.517 --> 35:06.147
But then I saw him send a text
to Oscar's second phone.

35:06.313 --> 35:09.658
Raquel, Oscar has a burner phone.

35:11.901 --> 35:15.246
Now, we could go after Waxier,
who may know something,

35:15.405 --> 35:19.535
or we could go after that phone
that could have everything.

35:31.463 --> 35:36.765
What a miserable night.
And Pete's already on his third drink.

35:36.885 --> 35:39.479
We both know how it goes after
that tipping point.

35:39.596 --> 35:42.349
If this is where we share
our war stories, I'll pass.

35:42.474 --> 35:46.069
Suit yourself. Besides, Raquel's
the one with the real horror story.

35:47.687 --> 35:51.317
Pete drunk drove with her son
in the car. That's why they broke up.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.464
The locker room is gonna be
a delight tomorrow.

36:09.125 --> 36:10.468
You look beautiful.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.514
Pete, don't.

36:15.548 --> 36:17.892
Earlier, I got caught up in a moment.

36:18.051 --> 36:20.930
I really just need to step back
for a second.

36:21.096 --> 36:25.647
Wait, Sloane.
This isn't you backing away.

36:25.809 --> 36:28.813
I've seen this before.
This is you shutting down.

36:33.149 --> 36:35.948
This feisty blonde
just threatened to burn my buns

36:36.111 --> 36:39.081
if I don't keep this shindig moving.

36:39.239 --> 36:41.742
Well, to go with Derek
acting like a big baby

36:41.908 --> 36:45.082
why don't we see some pictures
of Derek as a little baby.

36:48.415 --> 36:50.588
What a chocolate drop.

36:52.419 --> 36:55.343
His first motorcycle.

36:56.715 --> 37:01.562
Wow, look at the head on this boy.
Oh, my God.

37:26.411 --> 37:28.630
Derek, say something.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.920
Say you're angry,
say the jokes were bad.

37:32.375 --> 37:36.721
If you're not up to talking about it,
say that but please say something.

37:37.922 --> 37:39.265
Perfect.

37:48.224 --> 37:50.977
It's just a speeding ticket.
You weren't going fast.

37:52.187 --> 37:55.908
It'll be okay. And we're both sober.

37:59.861 --> 38:01.909
What? Why do you have that?

38:02.030 --> 38:04.829
- I'll explain, I promise.
- Licence and registration.

38:09.829 --> 38:11.957
Ma'am? Step out of the car.

38:18.505 --> 38:20.633
<i>Next time on Hit the Floor:</i>

38:20.799 --> 38:22.472
Your cocaine ended up in my bag.

38:22.634 --> 38:25.513
I'm online, naked, with a strap
tied around my arm.

38:25.637 --> 38:28.356
She's not in a position to say no.
Why are you here?

38:28.473 --> 38:31.443
- Looking for you.
- I didn't come to play backup.

38:31.559 --> 38:33.357
It's him or me, Jelena.

38:33.520 --> 38:37.445
- What are you hiding from me?
- Olivia had something on me.

38:37.607 --> 38:39.154
The blonde lady who died?

38:39.317 --> 38:41.866
- The one you were here with.
- That wasn't me.

38:42.028 --> 38:44.781
You had fun coming at me,
you came at my mother.

38:44.864 --> 38:47.788
Big mistake.
Now I'm coming for you.
