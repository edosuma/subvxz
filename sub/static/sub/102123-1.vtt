M_I_SForEver

02:34.638 --> 02:39.059
Forgive this man, found guilty here
of collaboration with the enemy.

02:40.602 --> 02:42.938
May God have mercy on your soul.

02:44.106 --> 02:45.107
Amen.

02:52.823 --> 02:54.032
Attention!

02:54.825 --> 02:58.287
Make ready! Aim!

03:00.747 --> 03:01.623
Fire!

03:29.109 --> 03:31.653
- Has it arrived? Is it here?
- Last night.

03:32.237 --> 03:35.449
- Jerome, good work on those etchings.
- I aim to please.

03:35.532 --> 03:37.534
There's a gift on your desk.
Cherries for the family.

03:37.618 --> 03:40.329
I'll try not to eat them
before I get home this time. Thank you.

03:47.169 --> 03:49.713
A Dutch Jew with a Canadian uniform.

03:50.964 --> 03:53.133
Captain. Captain Piller.

03:53.217 --> 03:54.593
Who let this one in?

03:58.597 --> 04:01.600
Dekker, this is Minna.
Minna, this is Dekker.

04:01.683 --> 04:03.685
- Hello, Minna. Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

04:03.769 --> 04:06.230
We used to be in the Resistance together.

04:06.313 --> 04:08.732
Yeah, but he couldn't resist anything
without me.

04:12.027 --> 04:14.363
- Working with the Allies now.
- Yes.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.947
Everything in here was stolen,

04:17.031 --> 04:19.493
and they put me in charge
of finding out who took it

04:19.576 --> 04:21.077
and who sold it to the Nazis.

04:22.371 --> 04:25.582
But I want to avoid interference
from the Ministry of Justice

04:25.666 --> 04:29.086
'cause they seem to have their own agenda,
and that's why I need you.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.296
I need someone I can trust.

04:31.380 --> 04:35.509
Well, anything for an old friend.
But do I have to wear a uniform?

04:35.592 --> 04:37.261
Oh, yeah, it's one of the perks.

04:38.011 --> 04:42.516
This was just found
in Göring's hidden collection.

04:42.599 --> 04:46.144
<i>Christ and the Adulteress.</i> It's a Vermeer.

04:46.228 --> 04:50.023
- Vermeer!
- And... we found a letter.

04:50.774 --> 04:52.067
Folded in the crate.

04:55.571 --> 04:57.614
I attended a show there once,

04:58.407 --> 05:00.409
had champagne and smoked salmon,

05:00.492 --> 05:02.452
and saw some terrible paintings.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.663
And what Germans did you meet there?

05:05.664 --> 05:07.124
I shook a hand or two.

05:08.333 --> 05:10.752
Those pigs were everywhere.
You couldn't avoid them.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.339
I never had that problem.

05:14.423 --> 05:16.091
No, me neither.

05:17.426 --> 05:19.595
I'm a personal friend of Prince Bernhard

05:20.095 --> 05:21.972
and the commander
of the Ministry of Justice.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.557
That's very good for you,

05:23.640 --> 05:26.602
but I don't work for the Dutch government
who ran off when things got hot.

05:26.685 --> 05:29.271
Dekker, will you please go sit down?

05:34.443 --> 05:37.404
I was commissioned by the Allied Command.

05:37.487 --> 05:40.741
Who will soon relinquish power
to the rightful Dutch government.

05:40.824 --> 05:42.242
But not today.

05:42.326 --> 05:43.994
And the more time I waste on you,

05:44.077 --> 05:47.706
the Nazi sympathizers
you drank champagne with will slip away.

05:47.789 --> 05:49.583
I'm afraid I must ask you to...

05:51.084 --> 05:55.505
In this letter,
the owner of the Goudstikker Gallery

05:56.006 --> 06:00.552
references you in verifying
the background of a Vermeer painting...

06:00.636 --> 06:01.929
I don't collect art.

06:02.012 --> 06:05.682
...before Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring
agreed to buy it.

06:11.438 --> 06:15.734
<i>Christ and the Adulteress</i> was
just recovered from a railway car

06:15.817 --> 06:17.486
in an Austrian salt mine.

06:17.986 --> 06:19.279
Thing about Göring...

06:20.322 --> 06:22.950
he kept meticulous records
of all his acquisitions.

06:23.033 --> 06:26.870
So, now, tell me about this letter.

06:30.874 --> 06:32.292
It was a favor.

06:33.919 --> 06:35.629
I had a respectable name.

06:36.922 --> 06:40.467
I simply wrote that I'd vouch
for the painting's provenance

06:40.551 --> 06:41.593
to finalize the sale.

06:41.677 --> 06:44.388
Because the painting had been stolen
from Jews?

06:46.348 --> 06:47.766
Who was the favor for?

06:49.434 --> 06:52.104
Who brought you the painting?

06:52.187 --> 06:53.564
Han Van Meegeren.

07:27.264 --> 07:28.265
Han Van Meegeren?

07:30.058 --> 07:31.143
Indeed.

07:31.226 --> 07:34.396
I'm Captain Joseph Piller
of the Allied Provisional Government.

07:35.105 --> 07:37.608
- Please, come in, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

07:46.783 --> 07:48.118
Were you expecting us?

07:49.286 --> 07:51.538
In these times, one expects anything.

07:52.247 --> 07:53.707
Do you play?

07:53.790 --> 07:55.626
No, not anymore.

07:59.213 --> 08:01.381
- May I offer you a drink?
- Yes.

08:01.465 --> 08:02.549
No, thanks.

08:05.552 --> 08:06.553
No?

08:13.060 --> 08:15.187
Do you live here all by yourself?

08:15.270 --> 08:18.148
For the time being.
I am recently divorced.

08:18.232 --> 08:19.900
This is my wife's house now.

08:20.484 --> 08:24.655
She is in France,
and the housekeeper went back to Utrecht.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.615
The war has been good to you, huh?

08:27.991 --> 08:30.452
I was lucky enough to sell
a series of Flemish primitives

08:30.536 --> 08:32.246
before hostilities broke out.

08:32.328 --> 08:33.828
So, you're an art dealer?

08:34.621 --> 08:36.750
I am a painter and an art lover.

08:37.668 --> 08:40.462
But, of course,
I take my opportunities where I can.

08:40.544 --> 08:42.923
And during the war, what did you do?

08:43.006 --> 08:45.092
Tried to survive, like everybody else.

08:45.175 --> 08:47.386
Running out of champagne
must have been devastating.

08:47.469 --> 08:50.681
Oh, not as bad as running out of caviar.
Shall we sit?

08:50.764 --> 08:52.975
No, no, we're taking a walk.

08:54.393 --> 08:55.435
Do I need a jacket?

09:02.526 --> 09:04.194
You haven't asked why I'm here.

09:05.362 --> 09:07.906
Well, I find that in life, as in art,

09:07.990 --> 09:10.576
it's always best
not to spoil the surprise.

09:11.451 --> 09:13.412
Or maybe it's no surprise at all.

09:17.374 --> 09:18.375
Shall we?

10:23.357 --> 10:26.652
- <i>Do you like Johannes Vermeer?</i>
- <i>Of course.</i>

10:26.735 --> 10:29.613
<i>The equal of Rembrandt, superior to Hals,</i>

10:29.696 --> 10:32.741
<i>and only a hair
behind Michelangelo and da Vinci.</i>

10:32.824 --> 10:36.286
And this one, <i>Christ and the Adulteress.</i>

10:36.370 --> 10:37.579
How does that rate?

10:39.957 --> 10:41.542
Undoubtedly a masterpiece.

10:42.167 --> 10:45.379
It has his hallmark command
of light and color

10:45.462 --> 10:50.592
and yet with a gravitas absent
from his more celebrated work.

10:50.676 --> 10:53.053
You take interest in art as well as music?

10:53.136 --> 10:54.930
Oh, no, no, no.

10:56.223 --> 10:59.851
What interests me is that it was sold
to Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring

10:59.935 --> 11:02.437
for more than 1.5 million guilders,

11:02.521 --> 11:07.150
which is the largest sum ever paid
for a work of art.

11:07.943 --> 11:10.737
Which proves
that pigs can sometimes have taste.

11:10.821 --> 11:12.614
Or perhaps too much money.

11:14.157 --> 11:17.494
I've traced the sale
back to the Goudstikker Gallery,

11:17.578 --> 11:21.164
through a network
of your associates, to you.

11:25.502 --> 11:27.504
I need to know
where this Vermeer came from.

11:27.588 --> 11:31.091
Was it from a looted collection?
Jews trying to flee Europe?

11:34.219 --> 11:37.514
Mr. Van Meegeren, as you know,

11:38.015 --> 11:42.144
collaboration with the enemy
is a capital offense.

11:42.227 --> 11:44.855
They're shooting people
in the streets daily.

11:45.981 --> 11:47.691
We all must die sometime.

11:48.734 --> 11:52.696
Although Vermeer, Hals, Bosch,
they live forever.

11:52.779 --> 11:54.740
They speak to us across the centuries.

11:54.823 --> 11:56.992
But you're not among those names,
are you...

11:58.118 --> 11:59.369
Mr. Van Meegeren?

12:00.829 --> 12:03.624
So, you must have made
your fortune some other way.

12:03.707 --> 12:08.253
And what, may I ask,
will be your great legacy, Captain Piller?

12:08.337 --> 12:10.464
Putting you and your friends in jail.

12:10.547 --> 12:11.965
Or in a noose.

12:12.591 --> 12:15.510
This is your chance at redemption

12:15.594 --> 12:19.223
and perhaps, more importantly, survival.

12:20.807 --> 12:25.187
And yet I am sensing that perhaps
it is you who needs redemption, no?

12:40.410 --> 12:41.662
Put him in solitary.

12:42.329 --> 12:44.623
Single rations. No visitors.

13:22.995 --> 13:25.747
- Finn, want to help me?
- Sure, Papa.

13:30.544 --> 13:32.337
- Take these.
- Okay.

13:33.672 --> 13:35.591
And they go into these.

13:48.437 --> 13:52.316
<i>Only I can paint the picture
that you so desperately want to see.</i>

13:54.651 --> 13:58.614
And what is it
that I so desperately want to see?

13:59.489 --> 14:01.658
You want justice against the wicked, yes?

14:02.701 --> 14:05.579
So, you're going to need me.

14:06.079 --> 14:09.833
But I ask a favor.
I need my paints. I need my brushes.

14:09.917 --> 14:12.294
- Please, send me home...
- I'll have them brought here.

14:12.920 --> 14:15.380
There is no life here, no inspiration.

14:17.716 --> 14:19.176
Do you want inspiration?

14:20.135 --> 14:24.097
What do you need inspiration for
if I break your hands?

14:44.618 --> 14:45.619
Piller?

14:47.246 --> 14:48.705
I'm Detective De Klerks.

14:50.165 --> 14:52.125
Ministry of Justice. Long time.

14:52.209 --> 14:56.380
I've heard you snagged a big fish,
a Van Meegeren. Is that right?

14:56.463 --> 14:59.508
- Who told you?
- Jungle drum, you know.

14:59.591 --> 15:01.009
We need to question him.

15:05.389 --> 15:07.975
We're on the same team.
We need to share information.

15:08.892 --> 15:10.310
Are we on the same team?

15:10.811 --> 15:14.147
Last time I handed over a lead,
he somehow slipped away.

15:14.231 --> 15:15.566
The old boys' network.

15:15.649 --> 15:20.237
Perhaps they should rename your outfit
the Ministry of Convenient Justice.

15:22.447 --> 15:24.867
You and me, we're just foot soldiers.

15:24.950 --> 15:26.910
We don't have to worry
about the big picture.

15:27.578 --> 15:30.706
I see. Well, keep your attention
on your feet, then.

15:31.582 --> 15:34.001
Excuse me. What were you before the war?

15:34.793 --> 15:36.253
A tailor, right?

15:36.336 --> 15:38.714
I've been a police investigator
for 15 years,

15:38.797 --> 15:40.841
and this could be bigger
than some paintings.

15:40.924 --> 15:44.219
This Van Meegeren may have helped fund
the Abwehr spy ring,

15:44.303 --> 15:45.804
laundering money for the Nazis.

15:45.888 --> 15:49.266
Even more reason your department
should stay away from this.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.518
All this bluster and confidence, Piller,

15:51.602 --> 15:54.521
it's a pretty good mask,
but you're in over your head here.

15:55.105 --> 15:56.815
Yeah. And you know it.

15:57.816 --> 16:00.485
Actually, I don't need your permission
to see Van Meegeren.

16:00.569 --> 16:01.778
I was just being courteous.

16:01.862 --> 16:04.406
This is a joint jurisdiction facility,

16:04.489 --> 16:09.536
and I have a signed order here
from the Dutch government

16:10.162 --> 16:11.538
granting me your fish.

16:13.916 --> 16:15.500
So, in fact, we'll take it from here.

16:33.393 --> 16:34.686
Ministry of Justice.

16:41.610 --> 16:42.611
Boys.

17:01.672 --> 17:03.382
Dekker? Dekker!

17:04.298 --> 17:05.592
Get him out.

17:10.721 --> 17:13.224
- Time for exercise. Come on.
- What?

17:13.307 --> 17:14.309
- Come on.
- Come on.

17:15.560 --> 17:16.811
Get him out of there.

17:38.625 --> 17:39.710
This way.

17:42.170 --> 17:43.171
Hey!

17:48.927 --> 17:49.928
Piller!

17:55.601 --> 17:58.729
Not that I didn't enjoy it,
but what the hell did we just do?

17:59.396 --> 18:03.025
De Klerks wants him,
but no one takes my fish.

18:04.234 --> 18:06.778
Your fish? How flattering.

18:20.083 --> 18:21.293
Very beautiful, Joe.

18:29.801 --> 18:30.802
Yes.

18:32.137 --> 18:34.973
Well, splendid.
I can definitely paint in here.

18:35.057 --> 18:36.683
As long as you're happy...

18:38.560 --> 18:40.229
I'll make a list of my supplies.

18:40.312 --> 18:43.190
My assistant, Cootje, knows
where everything is in my studio.

18:43.273 --> 18:44.775
And I'm going to need my whiskey.

18:45.359 --> 18:47.861
I'll get your paints.
Forget about the whiskey.

18:47.945 --> 18:51.156
And, please, don't play games with me.

18:51.240 --> 18:55.160
Mr. Dekker here has my permission
to break both your legs

18:55.244 --> 18:56.411
if you try and escape.

18:57.204 --> 18:59.248
May I borrow your notepad and pen?

19:06.380 --> 19:09.007
You are going to need to find this man.

19:12.970 --> 19:14.638
Theo Wijngaarden.

19:15.264 --> 19:16.598
Why? Who's he?

19:16.682 --> 19:19.726
He's the most important player
in this little game.

19:21.603 --> 19:23.564
Do you want your paints or not?

19:24.189 --> 19:27.067
Yes, and in return, all will be revealed.

19:27.150 --> 19:31.071
I believe Theo should be in Amsterdam.
I don't know. But you need to find him.

19:33.991 --> 19:35.492
Don't let him out of your sight.

19:38.078 --> 19:39.788
<i>This is outrageous!</i>

19:39.872 --> 19:44.167
Han Van Meegeren is instrumental
to our case. We have every right...

19:44.251 --> 19:46.545
His lackey, De Klerks,
tried to steal my prisoner.

19:46.628 --> 19:47.462
Enough.

19:51.216 --> 19:53.302
Where'd you serve in the war?

19:53.385 --> 19:56.221
- Don't see what that has to do with this.
- Answer the question.

19:57.055 --> 20:01.685
London. Helping Holland's efforts
to the best of my ability.

20:02.603 --> 20:04.396
Get the hell out of my office.

20:16.158 --> 20:17.034
Thank you.

20:18.410 --> 20:21.371
He'll be back.
Allied Command is coming to an end.

20:21.955 --> 20:25.375
And Theo Wijngaarden, what about him?

20:25.459 --> 20:26.835
I'll put it out on the wire.

20:33.467 --> 20:34.509
Joe.

20:36.178 --> 20:37.179
Ease up.

20:38.388 --> 20:40.682
You're not going to get
every single one of them.

20:53.612 --> 20:55.948
I had a call from the Ministry of Justice.

20:56.490 --> 20:58.575
They're taking you
off their Christmas list.

20:59.159 --> 21:00.953
Yeah, we don't have much time.

21:01.036 --> 21:03.163
We need to keep up the search
for Theo Wijngaarden.

21:03.247 --> 21:05.874
And let's put more pressure
on Van Meegeren.

21:09.294 --> 21:10.379
<i>Maybe I can help.</i>

21:11.964 --> 21:15.425
- You want to have a go at him?
- Yeah. I can rough him up a little.

21:16.134 --> 21:19.513
What? I'm not saying
it's going to be pretty, but...

21:19.596 --> 21:20.847
And here I was thinking

21:20.931 --> 21:23.892
that you're just a nice, quiet girl
from The Hague.

21:25.435 --> 21:27.396
We need to find Van Meegeren's wife.

21:28.313 --> 21:29.856
- Yes.
- Right.

21:29.940 --> 21:31.817
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

21:50.711 --> 21:51.545
Hello.

21:52.671 --> 21:53.672
Who was that?

21:54.882 --> 21:56.508
That's Minna. That's my assistant.

21:56.592 --> 21:59.177
She's helping me
with the Van Meegeren case.

22:00.262 --> 22:01.471
She's very pretty.

22:02.723 --> 22:05.309
Is she? I hadn't noticed.

22:05.893 --> 22:08.270
Must make the long hours so much easier.

22:08.770 --> 22:11.523
Do you want to talk about
your long hours during the war?

22:17.654 --> 22:18.947
That's not fair, Joe.

22:30.751 --> 22:33.754
Hey, boys. Looking to buy some art?

22:35.422 --> 22:39.051
We are crazy for art.
Love to take a peek at what you have.

22:39.134 --> 22:40.510
Well, we're closed now.

22:41.470 --> 22:42.346
Which means...

22:44.473 --> 22:47.267
take your boy scouts and fuck off.

22:52.856 --> 22:56.193
Tell your tailor he'll be sewing
prison uniforms for the next 40 years

22:56.276 --> 22:58.445
when I'm done with him, will you?

23:01.448 --> 23:02.449
Good dog.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.201
Let's go.

23:06.745 --> 23:08.497
Anything else we can get you?

23:08.997 --> 23:10.415
A drink would be nice.

23:14.336 --> 23:15.379
And who's she?

23:16.004 --> 23:18.340
This is my assistant, Cootje Henning.

23:18.423 --> 23:20.801
Cootje, meet my jailer, Joseph.

23:21.510 --> 23:23.095
I have to run.

23:26.014 --> 23:28.225
Next time, I'll try to bring your whiskey.

23:28.308 --> 23:29.601
Yes, if you could.

23:29.685 --> 23:33.063
She's not your assistant, is she?
She's your goddamn girlfriend.

23:33.647 --> 23:34.648
Little bit of both.

23:37.192 --> 23:38.861
She brought the paints.

23:38.944 --> 23:43.156
When she took her clothes off,
you know, what was I supposed to do?

23:43.866 --> 23:47.035
Miss Henning, wait up. I'd like a word.

23:47.119 --> 23:48.954
I'm late meeting my husband.

23:49.955 --> 23:51.373
Han knows where to find me.

23:53.333 --> 23:55.168
All for art, I assure you.

23:56.336 --> 23:59.631
- We're wasting time, Joe.
- No, you're wasting my time.

23:59.715 --> 24:01.633
Theo Wijngaarden can't be found.

24:02.426 --> 24:05.721
I don't imagine you've heard of a painter
by the name of Willem Gillisz Kool.

24:05.804 --> 24:07.306
No, I haven't.

24:07.389 --> 24:11.268
Kool created hundreds
of beautiful works three centuries ago,

24:11.351 --> 24:13.812
and not one of them is worth
the canvas they're painted on.

24:13.896 --> 24:16.481
Listen, I'm not interested in art history.

24:16.565 --> 24:18.191
Vermeer, on the other hand,

24:18.275 --> 24:20.235
paints just over 30 pictures
his whole career,

24:20.319 --> 24:22.070
each worth a staggering fortune.

24:22.154 --> 24:24.281
- Do you know why?
- No, and I don't care.

24:24.364 --> 24:25.574
You should.

24:25.657 --> 24:29.578
You think you're investigating art,
but you're investigating money and power.

24:29.661 --> 24:31.121
Then get on with it.

24:31.872 --> 24:36.752
Somebody decides.
A so-called expert, a critic.

24:36.835 --> 24:41.548
They proclaim that this is genius,
this is important, this is art.

24:41.632 --> 24:45.177
And so a legend begins
and a legend builds.

24:45.802 --> 24:49.765
Wealthy merchants see their chance
to become cultured by owning it,

24:49.848 --> 24:53.894
museums fight to put it on their walls,
and so it goes, on and on.

24:54.770 --> 24:58.523
When I was a boy,
my father used to beat me for painting.

25:00.234 --> 25:02.903
<i>Even though it was
the only passion in life I had.</i>

25:04.988 --> 25:07.074
But I took my beatings.

25:07.157 --> 25:10.202
And when I could,
I moved away from home to Paris

25:10.285 --> 25:11.328
and I painted even more.

25:11.411 --> 25:13.956
I drank too much,
I slept with too few women,

25:14.039 --> 25:15.707
and I eventually went insane.

25:15.791 --> 25:20.212
One very stormy night,
about to leap off the Eiffel Tower,

25:20.295 --> 25:22.339
a crack in the heavens opened.

25:22.422 --> 25:26.468
It could have been the absinthe,
but I swore I glimpsed the Almighty.

25:27.469 --> 25:29.054
I very quickly came back to Holland,

25:29.137 --> 25:33.267
and in a raging fever of creation,
I painted for months without sleep.

25:34.101 --> 25:35.644
Finally, when I collapsed,

25:36.478 --> 25:40.023
I wept for days, beholding my work.

25:40.107 --> 25:45.654
I had captured my soul on canvas,
snatched perfection from the gods.

25:46.613 --> 25:51.368
An influential friend immediately arranged
an exhibit at the Biesling Gallery.

25:51.451 --> 25:53.996
And the entire community was buzzing

25:54.079 --> 25:58.000
that a new, important artistic voice
had risen.

25:59.293 --> 26:00.961
<i>All of Amsterdam was there.</i>

26:01.753 --> 26:03.463
<i>I can still hear the chatter,</i>

26:03.547 --> 26:06.049
<i>smell the perfume
of all those beautiful women</i>

26:06.133 --> 26:07.968
<i>who suddenly realized I existed.</i>

26:08.677 --> 26:13.390
<i>The energy was palpable,
the critics... unanimous.</i>

26:17.269 --> 26:22.107
They said my ham-fisted attempt
at profundity was devoid of emotion,

26:22.190 --> 26:25.152
lacking in vision, utterly without soul.

26:26.153 --> 26:30.032
They not only wanted to destroy me,
they wanted to crush my bones into flour.

26:30.616 --> 26:31.617
Why?

26:36.205 --> 26:40.375
I had failed to properly seek
their illustrious approval.

26:43.045 --> 26:49.009
So, all my new admirers suddenly vanished
and it was over.

26:50.802 --> 26:54.014
Which brings us back
to <i>Christ and the Adulteress.</i>

26:57.434 --> 26:59.519
Is music in your blood, Joe?

26:59.603 --> 27:01.813
I'm sure you've had
your own Eiffel Tower moment.

27:01.897 --> 27:04.483
Did you not always just want to be
a piano player?

27:04.566 --> 27:07.069
Please, Mr. Van Meegeren,

27:07.653 --> 27:10.739
how did you come by the painting?

27:13.408 --> 27:15.494
The same way I came by all of them.

27:16.870 --> 27:19.289
With the help of my friend, Theo.

27:19.915 --> 27:24.211
Theo. Theo Wijngaarden,
this mysterious man.

27:25.879 --> 27:29.424
Dirk Hannema will know exactly
where he is.

27:29.508 --> 27:33.303
- And help me here, who's Dirk Hannema?
- He's a so-called expert.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.764
He's the guiltiest
of all of those critics.

27:36.890 --> 27:40.352
He's also the director
of the Boijmans Museum in Rotterdam,

27:40.435 --> 27:42.771
which still to this day confounds me.

27:45.232 --> 27:49.528
Well, Dekker, it seems
I'm on my way to Rotterdam.

28:56.261 --> 28:57.930
Awe-inspiring, isn't it?

29:00.390 --> 29:03.185
It teaches one the meaning of forgiveness.

29:03.268 --> 29:04.561
Mr. Hannema?

29:07.397 --> 29:10.192
Until I discovered <i>The Supper at Emmaus,</i>

29:10.275 --> 29:13.487
there were just over 30 Vermeers
known to be in existence.

29:13.570 --> 29:16.823
They've become the Holy Grails
of the 20th century.

29:17.491 --> 29:20.452
If there's any silver lining to this war,

29:21.537 --> 29:24.706
it's that other hidden masterpieces
may come to light.

29:25.916 --> 29:30.963
To discover this one was
the great accomplishment of my life.

29:32.214 --> 29:34.633
What can I do for you, mister...?

29:36.468 --> 29:38.011
Captain Piller.

29:38.971 --> 29:42.683
Yes. Your office has been keeping us busy.

29:44.309 --> 29:45.852
What brings you here?

29:45.936 --> 29:47.187
Theo Wijngaarden.

29:55.571 --> 29:58.156
You're Jewish, aren't you?

29:59.908 --> 30:02.744
Yes. Is that a problem for you?

30:03.745 --> 30:05.873
Tragic what happened to your people.

30:08.500 --> 30:09.585
My people?

30:11.378 --> 30:12.588
Aren't we all Dutch?

30:17.926 --> 30:20.470
Theo Wijngaarden. There.

30:22.723 --> 30:24.099
Do you know this fellow?

30:24.766 --> 30:28.520
A failure as a painter.
Not much of an art dealer either.

30:28.604 --> 30:29.980
What was your business with him?

30:30.063 --> 30:34.276
He was a competent restorer.
He did a job for me some time ago.

30:35.360 --> 30:37.279
And your opinion of Han Van Meegeren?

30:37.362 --> 30:40.407
Third-rate artist, first-rate opportunist.

30:41.700 --> 30:46.205
Did he associate with the Germans
floating around through the art scene?

30:46.997 --> 30:50.167
- It would surprise me if he didn't.
- And why's that?

30:50.250 --> 30:53.503
He's a raging narcissist
and a cunning devil.

30:53.587 --> 30:56.381
Enjoy your day, Captain Piller.

31:21.031 --> 31:22.449
Satan's piss.

31:26.119 --> 31:30.415
Well, that turpentine's all that's left,
thanks to your Nazi friends.

31:30.499 --> 31:32.834
You're misinformed. I have no friends.

31:32.918 --> 31:34.503
Yeah, I see why.

31:39.633 --> 31:40.968
This smells drinkable.

31:41.051 --> 31:43.428
That's my highest-grade paint stripper.
Why not try it?

31:43.512 --> 31:44.888
It'll give you a second asshole.

31:45.973 --> 31:47.891
Well, that'd be interesting.

31:50.435 --> 31:54.189
I'll tell you what, go to my house.
I have a whiskey collection in the cellar.

31:54.273 --> 31:57.150
Bring two cases here
and I will teach you how to drink.

31:59.486 --> 32:02.322
If I go to your house, you'll run.

32:03.574 --> 32:05.284
My diabolical plan foiled.

32:05.909 --> 32:08.120
Except I have no interest in running.

32:13.083 --> 32:15.002
Do I look that stupid to you?

32:15.794 --> 32:16.795
Of course not.

32:17.337 --> 32:20.340
People like you have done more
for this country than anybody.

32:26.013 --> 32:27.014
Damn right.

32:29.641 --> 32:31.184
So, what are you painting?

32:33.228 --> 32:35.731
My deliverance. I don't know yet.

32:35.814 --> 32:38.817
My subject is somewhat of a mystery to me.

33:32.496 --> 33:34.498
<i>It's quite liberating, you know.</i>

33:35.123 --> 33:38.293
To lay yourself bare and...

33:39.795 --> 33:41.380
have someone paint you,

33:41.922 --> 33:43.590
stroke by stroke.

33:45.968 --> 33:48.679
- I see.
- I suppose Theo was in love with me.

33:50.430 --> 33:55.561
He said I had a timeless Dutch face
that could grace the classics.

33:56.562 --> 34:01.984
Which was his way
of trying to get me into bed.

34:03.068 --> 34:07.489
And did Theo introduce you to Han?

34:07.573 --> 34:09.157
Yeah, I think so.

34:10.409 --> 34:12.869
Yeah, I think he did.

34:14.788 --> 34:15.873
Caroline.

34:17.666 --> 34:19.293
The perfect choice for you.

34:42.565 --> 34:44.568
<i>Han loves to paint me.</i>

34:46.195 --> 34:50.449
<i>You know, sometimes we don't...
We don't even touch.</i>

34:52.034 --> 34:53.367
<i>We don't need to.</i>

34:53.452 --> 34:57.121
<i>And tell me, your husband,
he doesn't mind?</i>

34:58.040 --> 35:01.126
<i>Well, Han thinks that, deep down,</i>

35:01.210 --> 35:06.632
<i>all men fantasize about their wives
being seduced by another man.</i>

35:07.925 --> 35:09.343
Or woman.

35:11.178 --> 35:14.890
Han understands the human animal
better than anyone.

35:15.724 --> 35:18.769
Is that why the Germans
were so fond of him?

35:20.646 --> 35:24.024
- <i>Everyone... Everyone likes Han.</i>
- The photograph!

35:24.107 --> 35:26.276
- <i>He's...</i>
- Five! Come on.

35:26.360 --> 35:28.779
- <i>He's the life of the party.</i>
- Four! Three!

35:28.862 --> 35:31.865
- <i>What Germans attended his parties?</i>
- Two! One!

35:34.952 --> 35:36.286
I never said they did.

35:37.621 --> 35:43.252
Look... I don't know anything
about <i>Christ and the Adulteress.</i>

35:44.127 --> 35:45.337
Or any Germans.

35:46.171 --> 35:49.174
And I have no idea where Theo is.

35:54.179 --> 35:55.973
Who did Han consort most with?

35:57.391 --> 36:02.938
Himself, me and his wife. Ex-wife.

36:03.021 --> 36:04.648
Johanna. Where's she?

36:05.524 --> 36:07.067
Somewhere in France.

36:07.150 --> 36:10.445
She got tired of his joie de vivre.

36:11.613 --> 36:15.742
But he gave her everything, you know.
The houses, the money.

36:16.577 --> 36:21.123
What other man would give his wife
his entire fortune?

36:26.670 --> 36:28.130
What did you find out?

36:28.213 --> 36:30.090
Well, depending on who you ask,

36:31.300 --> 36:33.552
he's either Satan or a saint.

36:35.137 --> 36:38.557
Maybe I'll find something
in Theo Wijngaarden's notebooks.

36:38.640 --> 36:41.476
Yes, and check death records, too, please.

36:41.560 --> 36:44.104
Yes, after I've finished the mail,
captain.

36:45.314 --> 36:46.523
Thank you.

36:51.737 --> 36:52.613
Hello?

36:56.575 --> 36:57.576
Dekker?

36:58.368 --> 36:59.912
Piller, in here!

37:04.458 --> 37:05.542
Walk towards me.

37:06.126 --> 37:07.002
Stop!

37:07.669 --> 37:11.256
Now, two steps to your right... Left.

37:12.799 --> 37:16.637
One more step.
Not that big. Half a step back.

37:17.888 --> 37:19.139
- Here?
- Yeah.

37:19.223 --> 37:22.893
- Yeah?
- Now walk slowly towards me.

37:24.269 --> 37:25.270
Just do it.

37:34.238 --> 37:35.614
You're gonna need this.

37:53.882 --> 37:55.092
How much is there?

37:55.968 --> 37:56.969
I don't know.

37:57.803 --> 38:00.472
It started whispering to me,
so I called you.

38:02.099 --> 38:04.142
Having a conscience
is a terrible affliction.

38:04.226 --> 38:06.186
Yes, but our reward will come later.

38:06.270 --> 38:09.648
You're damn right it will.
I got two cases of liquor packed.

38:09.731 --> 38:11.275
- No, no, no.
- What?

38:11.358 --> 38:14.278
- We're not taking any of that.
- What? We're gonna let it rot?

38:14.361 --> 38:17.072
Or leave it for some undeserving asshole?
It's hooch.

38:17.155 --> 38:20.200
- It's world-class hooch.
- Yes, and you've had enough.

38:20.284 --> 38:21.285
You've had plenty.

38:22.327 --> 38:25.330
Just a nip, to make sure
it wasn't an illusion.

38:26.456 --> 38:29.459
I've been having a lot of those lately,
and so have you, right?

38:29.543 --> 38:31.753
Yes, and booze is not gonna help,
my friend.

38:32.880 --> 38:34.214
Damn well might.

38:35.674 --> 38:39.344
This will bring back a bit
of the old world, help us readjust.

38:49.813 --> 38:53.442
Your wife just called.
Should I call her back? What should I say?

38:53.525 --> 38:56.361
Tell her I'll be late.
I'll deal with her later.

39:01.658 --> 39:05.204
New Year's Eve, two years ago.
That was some night.

39:05.287 --> 39:07.748
I bet. Who's who?

39:08.874 --> 39:10.626
That's Cootje on my left,

39:10.709 --> 39:13.045
and Johanna, my wife, on my right...
My ex-wife.

39:13.712 --> 39:15.923
Van Stuyvesande you've already met,
the old fop.

39:16.006 --> 39:17.883
And these are just friends of friends.

39:18.634 --> 39:21.428
What about this one here
next to the blond?

39:21.511 --> 39:23.597
The kraut with his arm around her?

39:23.680 --> 39:25.015
Wouldn't have a clue.

39:26.099 --> 39:27.559
Are you sure about that?

39:28.477 --> 39:30.687
Look at his face
and that criminal haircut.

39:30.771 --> 39:32.564
I wouldn't let that creep shake my hand.

39:33.607 --> 39:35.567
Do you remember not shaking his hand?

39:35.651 --> 39:39.738
Oh, Joe, you're so literal.
Have you found Theo yet?

39:39.821 --> 39:41.823
I don't want to talk
about phantoms right now.

39:41.907 --> 39:44.368
I want to talk about this Nazi spy

39:44.451 --> 39:46.912
who's toasting to your good health
in this photo.

39:46.995 --> 39:48.121
My parties are lively.

39:48.205 --> 39:50.916
People hear about free booze
and free drugs and easy women,

39:50.999 --> 39:53.252
and there were plenty
of those there that night.

39:54.920 --> 39:57.714
Well, he didn't just walk
in your door, did he?

39:57.798 --> 39:59.800
- Who brought him?
- I don't know.

40:00.384 --> 40:02.135
Jerome. Maybe it was Jerome.

40:02.219 --> 40:04.680
- Jerome Heidjen?
- Yes, but who cares?

40:04.763 --> 40:06.223
Look at all these beautiful women

40:06.306 --> 40:08.892
and you want to talk about
some pig farmer from Muggendorf.

40:10.519 --> 40:12.771
I think you have more
than a drinking problem.

40:13.313 --> 40:17.234
This pig farmer from Muggendorf
was called Hermann Kempf.

40:17.317 --> 40:19.278
He was a German intelligence officer,

40:19.361 --> 40:22.573
and he used to recruit Dutch citizens
to spy for him.

40:22.656 --> 40:26.285
Hermann Kempf was very costly
to the Dutch Resistance.

40:26.368 --> 40:28.495
I am an artist, not a Nazi spy.

40:28.579 --> 40:31.415
- Why did you hide the picture?
- I didn't hide it.

40:31.999 --> 40:35.043
- Maybe Johanna did before she left.
- Kempf shows up at your party.

40:35.127 --> 40:38.338
Shortly after, you take payment
of 1.6 million guilders

40:38.422 --> 40:41.842
from Hermann Göring,
far more than even a Vermeer is worth.

40:41.925 --> 40:45.095
And why? Because the Nazis
are so generous?

40:45.178 --> 40:47.347
No, because they're narcissistic.

40:47.431 --> 40:49.850
Hitler already had two Vermeers
in his collection.

40:49.933 --> 40:52.477
Göring wanted to outdo his Führer.

40:52.561 --> 40:56.148
He wanted to own the most valuable
painting in the world, legitimately,

40:56.231 --> 40:59.568
- which meant he had to pay for it.
- Or perhaps you were paid

40:59.651 --> 41:02.070
for something more
than just the painting.

41:02.154 --> 41:03.030
Such as?

41:04.281 --> 41:07.034
Money to funnel
to Nazi operatives in Holland,

41:07.117 --> 41:09.119
using the art world as a front.

41:20.839 --> 41:22.466
Jerome, it's Piller.

41:23.175 --> 41:24.218
Just a moment.

41:24.301 --> 41:25.427
Let me dress.

41:54.623 --> 41:56.250
Good evening, Jerome.

41:56.333 --> 41:59.503
Why don't you tell us about
your connection to Van Meegeren?

42:01.922 --> 42:03.715
It's been confirmed by others

42:03.799 --> 42:06.093
that you arrived
at his parties with Kempf,

42:06.176 --> 42:07.553
that you were friends.

42:09.596 --> 42:11.765
Keep your friends close,
your enemies closer.

42:11.848 --> 42:13.850
That's how I tried to deal with Nazis.

42:13.934 --> 42:15.602
Is that how you dealt with Kempf?

42:17.312 --> 42:20.482
You kept him close,
brought him cherries from your garden?

42:20.566 --> 42:21.775
I am speaking in general.

42:23.944 --> 42:25.487
Van Meegeren is setting me up.

42:26.446 --> 42:28.782
- He's got old scores to settle.
- Like what?

42:30.117 --> 42:31.660
Some things I said got back to him.

42:32.619 --> 42:35.122
He was a rotten artist, a lecherous drunk.

42:35.205 --> 42:38.041
That's bullshit.
You had this club going, right?

42:38.667 --> 42:41.587
You passed information and art
up the chain to Berlin.

42:41.670 --> 42:44.214
They lined your pockets
and let you keep your pretty homes.

42:44.298 --> 42:47.175
- No!
- Did you work with Theo Wijngaarden?

42:48.677 --> 42:49.970
You have their eyes.

42:50.888 --> 42:52.556
So locked in your crusade.

42:54.057 --> 42:55.726
You're not gonna listen to anything.

42:56.685 --> 42:58.937
You just need someone to nail to a cross.

43:13.994 --> 43:17.080
Now, that's a very interesting gun,
isn't it?

43:18.540 --> 43:21.460
That's the same gun
the German officers carry.

43:21.543 --> 43:23.045
And all that cash...

43:24.087 --> 43:25.714
From your Christmas club, is it?

43:28.759 --> 43:32.346
Come clean,
I'll guarantee you a fair trial.

43:39.937 --> 43:43.899
A fair trial? As if they won't
rip me apart in the streets.

43:45.108 --> 43:47.444
A Mussert. A traitor!

43:47.528 --> 43:50.155
Tell me the truth.
I promise I'll help you, Jerome.

44:02.626 --> 44:03.752
Talk to me!

44:19.184 --> 44:21.144
Joe? What's the matter?

44:35.075 --> 44:37.244
You met Han Van Meegeren.

44:46.795 --> 44:51.008
- You went to one of his parties.
- I went to a lot of parties, Joe.

44:51.675 --> 44:52.885
You know this.

44:54.970 --> 44:57.848
- With Kempf?
- Yes, with Kempf.

44:57.931 --> 44:59.975
What is this? What do you want me to say?

45:00.058 --> 45:02.060
I want you to tell me the truth.

45:02.144 --> 45:03.478
The truth?

45:03.562 --> 45:08.191
The truth is that I risked my life
every day to survive, Joe,

45:08.275 --> 45:09.401
and you left.

45:10.110 --> 45:11.236
I did not leave.

45:14.198 --> 45:17.659
I joined the Resistance.
Had to go underground.

45:18.243 --> 45:20.412
I'm a Jew, remember?

45:21.455 --> 45:24.416
If I'd stayed,
I would have endangered our family.

45:25.584 --> 45:26.835
What did you do?

45:26.919 --> 45:28.253
Went out to parties...

45:29.630 --> 45:30.881
dressed as a whore.

45:35.135 --> 45:36.678
We can't go on like this, Joe.

45:38.472 --> 45:42.184
I need to get out of the city
and go to my father's.

45:44.186 --> 45:45.020
That's fine.

45:52.653 --> 45:54.613
You've been going for six hours now.

45:56.365 --> 45:57.491
Don't you get tired of it?

45:58.158 --> 46:00.786
Inspiration is fleeting.
You do not waste it.

46:01.578 --> 46:03.539
All paint is merely ash and dirt,

46:03.622 --> 46:06.750
but layered together in perfect harmony
and you have a masterpiece

46:07.376 --> 46:12.214
that will survive wars, civilizations,
live longer than mountains.

46:13.257 --> 46:16.385
And that, my friend,
is as close to God as we get.

46:18.220 --> 46:19.346
It's all child's play.

46:19.972 --> 46:24.268
Exactly. Children know that secret,
and we grow up and forget.

46:24.351 --> 46:29.940
And the only way back is through alcohol
or pain, madness, self-destruction...

46:30.566 --> 46:31.817
Story of my life.

46:33.277 --> 46:36.488
- You miss the war, don't you?
- I miss the action, yeah.

46:36.572 --> 46:38.782
But I do like my country being safe.

46:47.791 --> 46:49.668
Why don't you paint something, my friend?

46:58.719 --> 47:01.013
What do you say?
I will make you a palette.

47:02.514 --> 47:05.642
Sure. I'll paint you a masterpiece.

47:09.646 --> 47:10.814
Well, look at that.

47:12.149 --> 47:13.150
Yeah.

47:13.817 --> 47:15.235
I'm still working on it.

47:16.236 --> 47:19.114
- I know it's a little childish.
- That was my whole point.

47:19.198 --> 47:21.950
This has a truth
and therein lies its power.

47:57.361 --> 47:59.154
Your dock worker painted that.

48:00.197 --> 48:01.031
It's awful.

48:02.115 --> 48:04.159
And yet you can't take
your eyes off it, can you?

48:04.701 --> 48:07.663
I have absolutely no problem
taking my eyes off it.

48:09.373 --> 48:11.041
Why did your wife leave you?

48:13.168 --> 48:14.503
She married an artist.

48:15.754 --> 48:17.381
But then I became a wealthy man.

48:17.464 --> 48:20.133
And you were fucking half the town,
weren't you?

48:21.176 --> 48:22.427
Well, yes.

48:27.057 --> 48:28.684
Is your wife leaving you, Joe?

48:30.602 --> 48:31.436
Yes.

48:34.523 --> 48:37.568
Or we're leaving each other.

48:40.696 --> 48:41.572
Never easy.

48:43.615 --> 48:46.618
But, truthfully,
marriage is an unnatural state.

48:47.160 --> 48:49.496
It's hard for people
to accept that, of course.

48:49.580 --> 48:50.581
You know what?

48:52.624 --> 48:55.002
I loved being married, but...

48:57.421 --> 48:58.755
the war killed us.

48:59.756 --> 49:00.799
The war is over.

49:01.884 --> 49:04.553
Well, the Nazis are still
at my house or...

49:05.971 --> 49:07.806
Or their ghosts are, anyway.

49:11.894 --> 49:13.645
My wife took a job...

49:14.730 --> 49:17.190
as a secretary for a German officer.

49:17.608 --> 49:21.987
It turns out it was Hermann Kempf,
the man whose hand you refused to shake.

49:23.322 --> 49:26.742
It was a way to funnel information
to the Resistance,

49:26.825 --> 49:28.785
and she was good.

49:30.245 --> 49:34.082
She was very good.
And her effort saved a lot of people.

49:35.542 --> 49:36.960
The Germans trusted her.

49:39.463 --> 49:43.926
But that trust had to be earned.

49:45.594 --> 49:48.305
She had to sleep with this man
to keep in his confidence.

49:49.223 --> 49:50.849
I never asked her about it.

49:53.644 --> 49:54.853
I asked her to quit.

49:56.063 --> 49:57.147
But only once.

49:59.650 --> 50:00.651
And now?

50:03.612 --> 50:05.822
The past no longer exists to her.

50:07.533 --> 50:09.326
She's cut it out like a tumor.

50:10.077 --> 50:12.746
I'm sure there are things
you have done in the Resistance

50:12.829 --> 50:15.165
that you won't be telling your wife.

50:17.084 --> 50:21.421
You should play piano again.
Music, art, it's good for the soul.

50:26.760 --> 50:28.595
Time is growing short, I think.

50:31.807 --> 50:35.644
My painting's nearly finished
and then I would like to show it to you.

50:57.666 --> 50:58.834
Would you like a drink?

51:02.087 --> 51:03.088
It's...

51:04.882 --> 51:06.592
It's Van Meegeren's private stash.

51:09.428 --> 51:10.262
Joe.

51:11.221 --> 51:12.055
It's good.

51:16.351 --> 51:17.436
It's empty.

51:19.229 --> 51:21.648
Yes, probably is.

51:24.693 --> 51:25.944
A walk might be good.

51:32.201 --> 51:35.871
- He offered me a job spying for them.
- One of De Klerk's?

51:36.747 --> 51:39.499
He said I should think about my future

51:39.583 --> 51:41.543
because the Allied Command
is on the way out.

51:43.879 --> 51:45.297
And what did you say to him?

51:46.965 --> 51:48.759
I said that I would think about it.

51:58.936 --> 52:01.188
You should think about your future.

52:02.648 --> 52:03.649
Yes, I know.

52:12.658 --> 52:13.492
This is me.

52:17.829 --> 52:21.291
What do you do up there? In the dark?

52:25.963 --> 52:27.214
I wait for the light.

52:33.387 --> 52:34.805
Were you waiting for me?

52:38.684 --> 52:40.143
Yes, I think I was.

53:21.894 --> 53:23.145
Is this your husband?

53:25.063 --> 53:25.898
Yes.

53:40.370 --> 53:43.582
When he died, I... didn't cry.

53:45.709 --> 53:46.543
Couldn't.

53:48.086 --> 53:49.588
I couldn't feel anything.

53:50.672 --> 53:51.673
I was numb.

53:54.676 --> 53:59.556
And then the war was over
and the Allies came, and I just continued.

54:01.350 --> 54:02.351
Just like that.

54:04.311 --> 54:06.813
And I was scared
I might not feel anything anymore.

54:10.734 --> 54:12.945
But now I see hope.

54:14.112 --> 54:14.988
For all of us.

54:16.573 --> 54:17.574
I don't know.

54:19.284 --> 54:21.286
Leez and I are like strangers now.

54:23.413 --> 54:24.248
It's...

54:29.586 --> 54:31.922
- You're tired.
- Yes, I am.

54:32.631 --> 54:34.591
Want to lie down? Rest?

54:35.217 --> 54:36.593
Yeah, I'd like that.

54:38.512 --> 54:39.555
Lie with me?

54:40.556 --> 54:41.390
Yes.

55:04.413 --> 55:05.789
It will be light soon.

55:07.124 --> 55:07.958
Yes.

55:09.042 --> 55:10.127
We'll wait for it.

55:21.138 --> 55:21.972
Yes, hello?

55:32.065 --> 55:34.318
Sorry, boss. There's too many of them.

55:40.616 --> 55:43.410
Closed for business. Fuck off.

55:44.161 --> 55:45.162
Let Piller in.

55:48.332 --> 55:49.333
And there he is.

55:54.254 --> 55:55.923
You blew it, Piller.

55:57.132 --> 56:00.928
Your bull-in-a-china-shop routine
finally pissed off the big boys

56:01.011 --> 56:04.514
and now this gallery
is Dutch government's property.

56:04.598 --> 56:06.225
- Okay, listen, I'm...
- No, no, no.

56:06.308 --> 56:08.393
Whatever you're selling, Piller,
I don't want it.

56:08.477 --> 56:10.145
I'm wrapping this whole thing up.

56:11.772 --> 56:13.982
You're gonna cut Van Meegeren a deal,
aren't you?

56:14.858 --> 56:15.859
Yes.

56:16.610 --> 56:19.404
You have a tin ear.
I'm going to cut his throat.

56:19.488 --> 56:22.449
Give the people some taste of blood.
Isn't that what you wanted?

56:22.533 --> 56:25.369
This guy is an honorary Nazi.
Let him swing with the rest of them.

56:25.452 --> 56:27.329
And I assumed
he had friends in high places.

56:27.412 --> 56:30.123
Yes, he does, and they'd all like
to see his head on a plate.

56:30.207 --> 56:31.750
Enough of this. Where is he?

56:31.833 --> 56:34.586
In the prison, where he belongs.
"Where is he?"

56:34.670 --> 56:37.130
You put him up there
like in some grand hotel.

56:37.214 --> 56:38.674
Did he offer you money?

56:38.757 --> 56:43.345
Actually, how much does it cost
to buy Joe Piller? How much?

56:44.054 --> 56:46.765
Hey! Get off! Get off.

56:48.350 --> 56:50.102
Get him out. Get him out!

56:53.772 --> 56:54.773
My hat, please.

56:58.819 --> 56:59.820
That's sweet.

57:01.780 --> 57:05.576
Hey, there's still a job here for you
if you want it, sweetheart.

57:07.244 --> 57:08.078
Joe.

57:09.580 --> 57:10.414
Come on.

57:18.297 --> 57:21.216
I had him. I goddamn had him.

57:21.300 --> 57:24.136
And now he's locked in that dungeon
and I can't get to him.

57:24.219 --> 57:26.305
We no longer have jurisdiction
over the prison,

57:26.388 --> 57:29.016
and Allied Field Security
has been disbanded.

57:29.641 --> 57:32.769
- Nothing left I can do.
- Not a single favor you can call in?

57:33.937 --> 57:37.858
In your government's eyes,
we're no longer liberators.

57:37.941 --> 57:40.903
We're the nuisance keeping Holland
from its future.

57:41.820 --> 57:44.531
Maybe it's time to move on, for all of us.

57:46.950 --> 57:50.662
Van Meegeren will pay for what he's done.
Isn't that what you wanted?

57:51.622 --> 57:53.624
Thanks to you, we got another one.

57:59.588 --> 58:00.589
Help me.

58:01.465 --> 58:02.466
Help me.

58:03.258 --> 58:04.259
Help.

58:18.148 --> 58:19.149
Help me!

58:19.691 --> 58:20.692
Traitor!

58:21.276 --> 58:22.528
Traitor!

58:28.867 --> 58:29.701
Help me!

58:34.248 --> 58:35.374
Help me!

58:40.504 --> 58:41.505
Attention!

58:43.131 --> 58:43.966
Aim!

58:49.471 --> 58:50.722
Fire!

59:45.068 --> 59:46.320
Thank you, Grandpapa.

59:50.199 --> 59:51.033
Joseph.

59:56.205 --> 59:57.789
- Bye, son.
- Bye, Papa.

59:59.499 --> 01:00:01.460
- Take care of yourself.
- Yes, sir.

01:00:01.543 --> 01:00:02.794
Promise me one thing.

01:00:03.503 --> 01:00:05.297
- Take care of Mommy.
- Promise.

01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:06.715
- Promise?
- Promise.

01:00:06.798 --> 01:00:07.799
Get a kiss?

01:00:57.099 --> 01:00:58.809
The ministry has complained.

01:01:54.156 --> 01:01:55.324
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:58.911
I'd give you a hug, but... Yeah.

01:02:03.248 --> 01:02:04.082
I...

01:02:05.876 --> 01:02:07.002
Can we take a walk?

01:02:08.462 --> 01:02:09.880
Yeah, sure.

01:02:14.301 --> 01:02:15.677
Yeah, so here I am.

01:02:17.429 --> 01:02:19.973
Full tarred and feathered
by the government.

01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.644
At least it gives you plenty of fresh air.

01:02:26.563 --> 01:02:29.566
<i>I know I wasn't allowed,
but I hate unfinished puzzles,</i>

01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:33.487
so I took all of Theo Wijngaarden's
notebooks home with me

01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:34.738
to have a closer look.

01:02:36.323 --> 01:02:39.618
And I think I found something.
Can I show it to you?

01:02:39.701 --> 01:02:40.536
Yes.

01:02:44.081 --> 01:02:45.165
Do you remember this one?

01:02:45.916 --> 01:02:48.919
This is Cootje Henning
drawn by Theo Wijngaarden.

01:02:49.002 --> 01:02:49.836
Yes.

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:53.882
Do you know he died
three months ago in Belgium?

01:02:53.966 --> 01:02:55.926
That hardly matters now, does it?

01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:01.098
And now... look at this one.

01:03:02.224 --> 01:03:04.560
<i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i>
by Johannes Vermeer.

01:03:04.643 --> 01:03:05.477
Exactly.

01:03:08.564 --> 01:03:09.690
Look at this one.

01:03:11.525 --> 01:03:14.903
- This one I don't know.
- Also Vermeer. <i>The Smiling Girl.</i>

01:03:15.654 --> 01:03:18.782
This one was a known Vermeer
when he was still alive.

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:23.453
This one... was found in 1926

01:03:23.537 --> 01:03:27.082
and authenticated in 1928 by Dirk Hannema.

01:03:27.165 --> 01:03:30.168
Now it's in the National Gallery of Art
in Washington, D.C.

01:03:30.836 --> 01:03:33.338
All right. And why am I looking at it?

01:03:35.757 --> 01:03:36.758
What do you see?

01:03:37.426 --> 01:03:39.553
I see two women.

01:03:40.429 --> 01:03:41.805
Look at their faces.

01:03:50.814 --> 01:03:52.774
Look. They look like sisters.

01:03:54.067 --> 01:03:56.153
They look almost the same.

01:03:56.737 --> 01:04:00.365
So what? So, someone looked
like Cootje Henning 280 years ago.

01:04:00.449 --> 01:04:04.119
No. This painting is not 280 years old.

01:04:04.661 --> 01:04:06.371
This is Cootje Henning.

01:04:09.583 --> 01:04:10.918
So, you're saying it's a fake.

01:04:11.835 --> 01:04:13.253
This is Cootje Henning

01:04:13.337 --> 01:04:16.757
painted to look like a Vermeer
by Theo Wijngaarden.

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:19.384
Theo Wijngaarden was not talented enough.

01:04:33.982 --> 01:04:35.651
I know someone who can help.

01:04:40.155 --> 01:04:40.989
Minna!

01:04:41.073 --> 01:04:43.617
Look, it may not be past your bedtime,

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:46.537
- but it is certainly past mine.
- Can we come in?

01:04:47.996 --> 01:04:50.290
One moment, please. My wife.

01:04:59.508 --> 01:05:02.052
Sir, are you a registered lawyer?

01:05:03.095 --> 01:05:04.972
Minna, who is this man?

01:05:05.722 --> 01:05:09.184
This is Joseph Piller.
He's... He's a good man.

01:05:10.978 --> 01:05:12.187
I see.

01:05:12.271 --> 01:05:16.400
I am a registered lawyer, yes,
but I haven't practiced for...

01:05:16.483 --> 01:05:19.820
- You're hired.
- Hired? My dear fellow...

01:05:19.903 --> 01:05:22.239
I can offer you a dozen ration tickets.

01:05:36.128 --> 01:05:37.129
My credentials.

01:05:38.171 --> 01:05:40.173
This is my paralegal, Jacob.

01:05:43.218 --> 01:05:46.972
You stink of mothballs.
When did you last wear that?

01:05:48.682 --> 01:05:51.143
My wedding. My name is Joseph.

01:05:53.812 --> 01:05:55.647
No one is permitted to see him.

01:05:56.690 --> 01:06:00.736
This facility is now governed
by Dutch law, not military, yes?

01:06:02.196 --> 01:06:05.157
Mr. Van Meegeren is entitled
to legal representation,

01:06:05.240 --> 01:06:06.241
and I'm his lawyer.

01:06:06.992 --> 01:06:09.953
If you refuse me access,
I will take it to a judge

01:06:10.037 --> 01:06:12.497
and move to have the entire case dropped.

01:06:13.624 --> 01:06:16.585
Call someone
and tell them exactly that. Now!

01:06:18.378 --> 01:06:19.213
Very good.

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.384
This painting that you sold to Göring,

01:06:24.468 --> 01:06:26.136
<i>Christ and the Adulteress,</i>

01:06:27.304 --> 01:06:28.430
it's not a Vermeer.

01:06:30.432 --> 01:06:32.184
It's a fake. You painted it.

01:06:34.519 --> 01:06:35.354
Finally.

01:06:36.355 --> 01:06:38.023
Why didn't you just tell me?

01:06:39.149 --> 01:06:40.567
You would have believed me?

01:06:41.443 --> 01:06:42.778
The experts would have told you

01:06:42.861 --> 01:06:44.905
it's impossible
to fake the immortal Vermeer,

01:06:44.988 --> 01:06:47.658
and I needed you
to discover the truth for yourself.

01:06:48.492 --> 01:06:50.327
Always best, don't you think?

01:06:50.410 --> 01:06:52.037
And Theo's part in this?

01:06:52.871 --> 01:06:55.082
Theo taught me a very important part
of the process.

01:06:55.165 --> 01:06:57.167
He is my only witness.
Have you found him yet?

01:06:58.919 --> 01:07:01.922
I am sorry to tell you this,
but Theo is dead.

01:07:04.508 --> 01:07:07.135
- How? Do you know?
- I don't know how.

01:07:13.517 --> 01:07:15.143
So, there was no spy ring?

01:07:17.271 --> 01:07:18.939
I'm sure there was. I don't know.

01:07:19.022 --> 01:07:23.277
I am merely a lost artist who found
his calling imitating the masters.

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:26.071
And I stuck those Nazi pigs
for all I could.

01:07:28.282 --> 01:07:29.741
But you know the best part for me?

01:07:30.701 --> 01:07:33.036
The experts swooning over my creations,

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.956
calling them the most exquisite works
ever put to canvas.

01:07:37.833 --> 01:07:39.501
That made Theo very proud.

01:07:41.587 --> 01:07:44.965
How are we gonna prove any of this,
now that Theo is dead?

01:08:02.733 --> 01:08:03.942
He kept it safe.

01:08:14.328 --> 01:08:16.037
<i>We have your painting.</i>

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:20.082
- Good.
- And... it looks just like a Vermeer.

01:08:21.042 --> 01:08:23.337
A Vermeer that was painted
only two weeks ago.

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:26.131
That's right.
There's more that must be done to it.

01:08:26.214 --> 01:08:30.509
Now, this is the process
that Theo and I perfected,

01:08:30.594 --> 01:08:32.970
which fools the alcohol test
used by the experts,

01:08:33.054 --> 01:08:35.473
which means
the painting can be authenticated.

01:08:35.557 --> 01:08:37.350
Well, none of this may matter.

01:08:38.893 --> 01:08:40.687
- Why?
- Do you think

01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:45.734
that the owners of these masterpieces
will deface them on your behalf?

01:08:45.817 --> 01:08:48.529
We only have to prove
that one of them is a fake, surely.

01:08:48.612 --> 01:08:51.823
Do you think that the experts
who authenticated these paintings

01:08:51.906 --> 01:08:53.866
and whose reputations will be destroyed...?

01:08:53.951 --> 01:08:56.286
Can you wait a second, please?

01:08:56.370 --> 01:08:59.872
Whose reputations will be destroyed,
do you think they will help you?

01:08:59.957 --> 01:09:03.167
I'm not asking them to help me.
I'm asking you to help me.

01:09:03.252 --> 01:09:06.087
Go to my basement!
Everything you need is there!

01:09:13.761 --> 01:09:15.054
Yeah, close it.

01:09:17.432 --> 01:09:18.475
All right.

01:09:18.558 --> 01:09:21.562
Stuyvesande, Wijngaarden.

01:09:22.103 --> 01:09:22.937
Yes.

01:09:25.274 --> 01:09:26.524
<i>Christ and the...</i>

01:09:26.607 --> 01:09:29.152
- <i>Christ and the Adulteress.</i>
- Yes.

01:09:36.576 --> 01:09:39.120
It's no good. I can't remember.

01:09:40.746 --> 01:09:42.499
And when I remember, I can't remember.

01:09:42.582 --> 01:09:45.919
I lock up and become a stammering fool.

01:09:46.002 --> 01:09:50.631
Mr. Bakker, you don't have to remember.
I'll remember. And I'll do the talking.

01:09:51.341 --> 01:09:54.803
I just need you to keep me straight
on the legal stuff.

01:10:03.854 --> 01:10:05.272
It says to be rough with it.

01:10:15.365 --> 01:10:17.534
Please, find someone else.

01:10:17.618 --> 01:10:19.411
You're the only one who I can trust.

01:10:20.037 --> 01:10:21.788
You don't have a career to protect.

01:10:36.678 --> 01:10:39.139
Why do you care so much about this man?

01:10:42.017 --> 01:10:45.479
It's not the man, really.
It's the fact that he's innocent.

01:10:48.523 --> 01:10:50.776
How can I let him go to his death?

01:10:53.195 --> 01:10:55.447
How could I face my son, knowing that?

01:10:56.698 --> 01:10:58.492
You're not going to like this.

01:11:00.369 --> 01:11:03.121
They say you've tried to shield
Van Meegeren from the authorities.

01:11:03.872 --> 01:11:05.832
De Klerks has put a bull's-eye on you.

01:11:09.253 --> 01:11:11.755
De Klerks. Sad, little man.

01:11:30.482 --> 01:11:32.276
- Traitor!
- Traitor!

01:11:42.244 --> 01:11:43.912
Dekker, stop. Stop. Stop!

01:12:54.399 --> 01:12:56.235
Henricus Antonius Van Meegeren.

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:02.533
You are charged with collaborating
with the enemy during a time of war.

01:13:02.616 --> 01:13:03.617
How do you plead?

01:13:04.326 --> 01:13:05.911
Not guilty, Your Honor.

01:13:06.828 --> 01:13:07.663
Very well.

01:13:08.872 --> 01:13:09.706
Proceed.

01:13:10.791 --> 01:13:13.961
May it please the court, I am
Special Prosecutor Maarten Wooning.

01:13:14.795 --> 01:13:18.006
The government will prove to the court
that Mr. Van Meegeren is guilty

01:13:18.090 --> 01:13:22.594
of selling Dutch cultural treasures
to Hitler's Reich,

01:13:22.678 --> 01:13:25.013
for the purpose of enriching himself

01:13:25.097 --> 01:13:28.141
and giving aid
to the occupational government.

01:13:28.225 --> 01:13:31.937
A capital offense for which he deserves
the harshest punishment.

01:13:32.813 --> 01:13:33.897
Thank you.

01:13:39.194 --> 01:13:40.237
I'm Captain Jo...

01:13:41.697 --> 01:13:43.365
I'm Captain Joseph Piller.

01:13:44.116 --> 01:13:45.617
May it please the court.

01:13:47.035 --> 01:13:50.539
May it please the court.
I am former Captain Joseph Piller.

01:13:50.622 --> 01:13:52.666
Are you a lawyer, Mr. Piller?

01:13:52.749 --> 01:13:56.461
No, sir. Mr. Bakker here next to me
is a lawyer.

01:13:57.212 --> 01:14:00.591
But I have spent more time than anyone
investigating Mr. Van Meegeren,

01:14:00.674 --> 01:14:03.802
and I've come to the conclusion
that he is innocent of these charges.

01:14:04.344 --> 01:14:08.223
Hence, I was asked by the defendant
to speak on his behalf.

01:14:09.725 --> 01:14:11.435
- Very well.
- We will prove

01:14:12.185 --> 01:14:14.855
that Mr. Van Meegeren
is not a collaborator

01:14:14.938 --> 01:14:16.398
but indeed a patriot,

01:14:16.481 --> 01:14:20.736
who swindled the Nazi regime
out of a fortune from their war chest

01:14:20.819 --> 01:14:23.822
by selling them a fake masterpiece.

01:14:23.906 --> 01:14:25.574
How much did he pay you, Piller?

01:14:28.869 --> 01:14:29.703
Quiet.

01:14:32.414 --> 01:14:33.415
Mr. Wooning.

01:14:35.375 --> 01:14:37.836
Mr. Henricus Van Meegeren.

01:14:38.378 --> 01:14:40.964
We might save time
if you just call me Han.

01:14:42.466 --> 01:14:45.636
Very well. Do you recognize this receipt?

01:14:47.346 --> 01:14:49.181
I would hope so. Those are my initials.

01:14:49.890 --> 01:14:52.351
Please tell the court what it was for.

01:14:53.268 --> 01:14:56.688
It is the bill of sale
for <i>Christ and the Adulteress.</i>

01:14:56.772 --> 01:15:00.859
That you sold to the second-highest
ranking Nazi in the Reich

01:15:01.652 --> 01:15:05.572
for the staggering sum
of 1.6 million guilders.

01:15:05.656 --> 01:15:08.158
Indeed. It is a unique painting.

01:15:08.242 --> 01:15:12.621
I'd say. That's the most on record
ever paid for a work of art.

01:15:13.539 --> 01:15:16.458
If I'd offered a discount,
he would have suspected it was a fake.

01:15:21.797 --> 01:15:26.510
Johannes Vermeer was one
of the greatest artists in history.

01:15:27.719 --> 01:15:30.055
And you're asking this court
to believe that you,

01:15:30.722 --> 01:15:33.976
a man who could hardly sell
a single picture with your own name on it,

01:15:34.768 --> 01:15:38.105
somehow painted better
than the Master of Delft

01:15:38.188 --> 01:15:41.441
and outsmarted the world's
most esteemed Vermeer experts?

01:15:41.525 --> 01:15:42.818
Well-stated, sir.

01:15:43.694 --> 01:15:46.196
All you've left me to say is yes.

01:15:51.326 --> 01:15:53.912
I call Dirk Hannema to the floor.

01:15:59.376 --> 01:16:02.421
Mr. Hannema,
state your credentials for us.

01:16:02.921 --> 01:16:06.300
I have been the director
of the Boijmans Museum for eight years.

01:16:06.383 --> 01:16:10.637
Before that, I was an art dealer
for six of the top galleries in Holland

01:16:10.721 --> 01:16:13.390
and also the chief critic
for the <i>Nederlander.</i>

01:16:14.141 --> 01:16:17.144
How many paintings have you verified
in your career?

01:16:17.227 --> 01:16:18.103
Hundreds.

01:16:18.186 --> 01:16:20.480
- Come across any fakes?
- Scores.

01:16:20.564 --> 01:16:22.232
They're quite easy to spot.

01:16:22.316 --> 01:16:25.819
In rare cases, the technique is adequate,

01:16:25.903 --> 01:16:29.031
but none pass the chemical test used
to verify their age.

01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:34.703
You were one of the experts
who verified <i>Christ and the Adulteress.</i>

01:16:34.786 --> 01:16:36.997
Indeed, very thoroughly.

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:39.958
- Could it possibly be a fake?
- Absolutely not.

01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:42.127
But that's just your opinion.

01:16:42.211 --> 01:16:45.339
I consulted
with half a dozen published experts

01:16:45.422 --> 01:16:47.466
who have spent two months
with the painting,

01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:49.593
cleaning and restoring it,

01:16:49.676 --> 01:16:52.930
- and came to the same conclusion I did.
- Which is?

01:16:53.597 --> 01:16:57.684
Johannes Vermeer painted
<i>Christ and the Adulteress</i> around 1660.

01:16:59.519 --> 01:17:01.230
Do you know the defendant?

01:17:01.313 --> 01:17:04.566
Mr. Van Meegeren and I have crossed paths
in the art world.

01:17:04.650 --> 01:17:07.945
And is there any way
he could have created a Vermeer?

01:17:10.614 --> 01:17:12.032
There is no way.

01:17:12.115 --> 01:17:18.038
This was painted by the defendant
around the time <i>Adulteress</i> sold.

01:17:20.791 --> 01:17:23.168
Mr. Van Meegeren's art
has always been imbued

01:17:23.252 --> 01:17:26.713
with a base, almost pornographic nature.

01:17:26.797 --> 01:17:31.552
It's fantasy to believe these two works
were painted by the same man.

01:17:32.553 --> 01:17:33.387
Thank you.

01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:36.265
Mr. Piller?

01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:42.396
Some ten years ago,
you discovered another lost Vermeer.

01:17:42.479 --> 01:17:44.147
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

01:17:44.648 --> 01:17:45.732
<i>The Supper at Emmaus.</i>

01:17:46.358 --> 01:17:49.695
That made you...
a bit of a celebrity, right?

01:17:49.778 --> 01:17:51.405
Well, I suppose.

01:17:52.114 --> 01:17:54.950
It's now considered
Vermeer's greatest triumph.

01:17:55.576 --> 01:17:57.995
Mr. Hannema,
help me understand something.

01:17:58.996 --> 01:18:03.000
Vermeer painted just over 30 works
in the 1600s,

01:18:03.083 --> 01:18:08.338
with no new works being discovered
for the next 250 years.

01:18:09.172 --> 01:18:13.385
Then, suddenly, six new works
are found in as many years

01:18:13.468 --> 01:18:16.263
and all of them traceable
back to one person...

01:18:17.764 --> 01:18:18.974
Mr. Van Meegeren.

01:18:19.057 --> 01:18:20.559
What it tells me

01:18:20.642 --> 01:18:24.187
is that Van Meegeren got the paintings
from a single source,

01:18:24.855 --> 01:18:26.773
a family, perhaps,

01:18:26.857 --> 01:18:29.776
desperate to flee Europe
before the war began.

01:18:30.861 --> 01:18:32.321
Perhaps Jews.

01:18:35.949 --> 01:18:41.747
And has any member of this mystery family
come forward, Mr. Hannema?

01:18:43.123 --> 01:18:46.668
Provenances are sometimes difficult
to authenticate during wartime.

01:18:47.794 --> 01:18:49.671
So, the answer to that question is no.

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:58.513
How do you determine
if a painting is real or fake?

01:18:58.597 --> 01:19:01.934
A deep intuition
that cannot be put into words,

01:19:02.517 --> 01:19:05.979
followed by scrupulous analysis
of the painter's technique,

01:19:06.063 --> 01:19:08.148
composition and color palette.

01:19:08.232 --> 01:19:10.651
And should it pass this rigorous process,

01:19:11.109 --> 01:19:13.654
the final arbiter
is the application of alcohol

01:19:13.737 --> 01:19:15.447
to a tiny portion of the canvas.

01:19:16.114 --> 01:19:18.742
Oil paints dry and harden over time,

01:19:18.825 --> 01:19:21.537
and by that, I mean decades,
even a century.

01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:26.416
If the paint dissolves, it's a fake.
Let me demonstrate for you.

01:19:36.176 --> 01:19:38.262
It's completely safe, I assure you.

01:19:46.728 --> 01:19:48.855
No paint, no forgery.

01:19:49.773 --> 01:19:51.900
And this technique is foolproof?

01:19:52.609 --> 01:19:56.655
When it comes to oil paint,
you simply can't cheat time.

01:19:58.907 --> 01:20:00.951
Thank you, Mr. Hannema.

01:20:02.244 --> 01:20:06.081
Ladies and gentlemen,
<i>The Supper at Emmaus.</i>

01:20:14.548 --> 01:20:16.008
It became my passion

01:20:16.091 --> 01:20:19.887
after critics like Dirk Hannema
destroyed my career years earlier.

01:20:19.970 --> 01:20:24.933
So, you painted all these
as sort of revenge?

01:20:25.434 --> 01:20:27.644
And others which are not here today.

01:20:27.728 --> 01:20:30.439
They are hanging in the Rijksmuseum,
the Boijmans,

01:20:31.148 --> 01:20:32.691
even in the National Gallery of Art

01:20:32.774 --> 01:20:35.110
in the capital
of the United States of America.

01:20:35.819 --> 01:20:37.821
And I painted them not as revenge

01:20:37.905 --> 01:20:41.366
but to bring more beauty
into the world, more Vermeer.

01:20:42.201 --> 01:20:43.368
There is simply not enough.

01:20:45.621 --> 01:20:51.001
And tell us how you might pass
the alcohol test Mr. Hannema described.

01:20:51.543 --> 01:20:54.338
Same way I pass every alcohol test,
with flying colors.

01:20:55.797 --> 01:20:58.675
Mr. Van Meegeren, answer the question.

01:21:00.677 --> 01:21:03.847
I use a very common plastic resin
called Bakelite.

01:21:04.389 --> 01:21:07.184
Invented in 1908,
it was the first plastic.

01:21:07.684 --> 01:21:09.895
And when it's heated,
it perfectly emulates

01:21:09.978 --> 01:21:13.148
the hardness and consistency
of centuries-old paint,

01:21:13.232 --> 01:21:17.069
so Mr. Hannema can douse it in alcohol
all day if he so chooses

01:21:17.152 --> 01:21:19.196
and he won't succeed
in removing any of it.

01:21:19.279 --> 01:21:21.865
And what challenges does one face?

01:21:22.574 --> 01:21:25.369
Because the Bakelite is mixed
into the pigment,

01:21:25.452 --> 01:21:27.704
<i>it makes it very difficult
to compose with.</i>

01:21:28.830 --> 01:21:31.792
- And then?
- I must also find canvas and frame

01:21:31.875 --> 01:21:34.836
from the correct period.
They are impossible to duplicate.

01:21:35.587 --> 01:21:37.005
<i>Once the canvas is stripped,</i>

01:21:37.089 --> 01:21:40.592
<i>I then must create
an unmistakably original work.</i>

01:21:40.676 --> 01:21:43.887
I have studied every one
of Vermeer's brushstrokes.

01:21:43.971 --> 01:21:47.307
I understand perfectly
the pressure he applied,

01:21:47.391 --> 01:21:48.767
<i>the movement of his wrist,</i>

01:21:48.850 --> 01:21:51.979
<i>even the hairs that he's chosen
for each brush.</i>

01:21:52.062 --> 01:21:54.690
<i>I also understand
how he mixes his pigments</i>

01:21:54.773 --> 01:21:56.567
as well as how he interprets light.

01:21:56.650 --> 01:21:59.111
So, you tried to emulate a genius?

01:21:59.194 --> 01:22:03.490
Yes, but more than that, I must also weave
the present into the past

01:22:03.574 --> 01:22:06.869
to make the viewer my coconspirator,

01:22:06.952 --> 01:22:09.955
so it not only fools the mind,
it tugs at the heart.

01:22:10.455 --> 01:22:13.625
Look at my lacemaker.
Is she from Vermeer's time?

01:22:14.710 --> 01:22:19.214
No. She is a jazz-age flapper.
And she arouses you, yes?

01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:22.968
And if you look closely
at this young lady here,

01:22:23.051 --> 01:22:25.178
you may recognize the face of Greta Garbo.

01:22:25.262 --> 01:22:26.722
Göring was no different.

01:22:27.222 --> 01:22:30.893
At the Olympics in '36,
I learned of the kind of art he liked,

01:22:30.976 --> 01:22:35.898
so when I painted <i>Adulteress,</i>
I gave him his very own Nazi Jesus.

01:22:37.858 --> 01:22:41.612
He believed he was gazing
at a 300-year-old painting,

01:22:41.695 --> 01:22:46.033
but as Narcissus, he would see
his own eternity in that canvas,

01:22:46.575 --> 01:22:48.410
his thousand-year Reich.

01:22:50.329 --> 01:22:52.623
Never once occurred to him
the painting was a fake.

01:22:53.248 --> 01:22:56.585
And, Mr. Van Meegeren,
your views on fascism?

01:22:57.711 --> 01:22:59.087
I despise it intensely.

01:22:59.922 --> 01:23:02.049
I believe every fascist deserves
to be swindled.

01:23:04.218 --> 01:23:05.219
Thank you.

01:23:12.726 --> 01:23:15.687
All these exploits...

01:23:18.565 --> 01:23:21.068
Yet there isn't a soul
to corroborate any of it.

01:23:21.151 --> 01:23:23.570
All we have is your fantastic story...

01:23:24.363 --> 01:23:27.115
against the experts' facts.

01:23:27.199 --> 01:23:29.910
And you declare yourself
a hater of fascists,

01:23:30.619 --> 01:23:32.287
yet you were a registered member

01:23:32.371 --> 01:23:35.666
of the fascist-leaning Unity Party
before the war.

01:23:36.375 --> 01:23:39.795
- That was simply a matter of...
- In fact, the chairman of the party

01:23:39.878 --> 01:23:44.049
described you as,
"One of our best contemporary artists,

01:23:44.132 --> 01:23:46.718
motivated more by passion
for our principles

01:23:46.802 --> 01:23:50.055
than by desire for material gains."

01:23:50.639 --> 01:23:53.517
They weren't Nazis. They were
the wealthy and elite of society.

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:57.854
Closet fascists who saluted the Nazis
when they took over.

01:23:57.938 --> 01:24:00.899
They could afford to have flattering
portraits of themselves painted,

01:24:00.983 --> 01:24:03.068
and as a young artist,
that was survival for me.

01:24:03.151 --> 01:24:04.987
Is there anything else
you haven't told me?

01:24:05.070 --> 01:24:08.532
Nothing. I would have told you this
if I'd remembered such nonsense.

01:24:08.615 --> 01:24:10.409
You had the courtroom!

01:24:12.286 --> 01:24:13.829
You got under their skin.

01:24:13.912 --> 01:24:17.040
And now Wooning has taken away
all your credibility.

01:24:18.083 --> 01:24:19.710
And there's something else.

01:24:19.793 --> 01:24:22.588
Wooning has found your ex-wife in France.

01:24:23.463 --> 01:24:25.090
He's going to put her on the stand.

01:24:30.095 --> 01:24:30.929
Well, this...

01:24:32.139 --> 01:24:33.223
This is good news.

01:24:34.641 --> 01:24:36.310
That is good news indeed.

01:24:43.108 --> 01:24:47.529
Your ex-husband gave you
most of the assets in the divorce.

01:24:48.363 --> 01:24:50.741
- He did.
- And what were those?

01:24:51.491 --> 01:24:52.618
Couldn't tell you.

01:24:55.495 --> 01:24:57.206
Fourteen houses,

01:24:58.123 --> 01:25:00.542
seven plots of land in Laren,

01:25:00.626 --> 01:25:02.586
two homes in Deventer,

01:25:02.669 --> 01:25:04.755
a chateau in Monaco,

01:25:05.797 --> 01:25:11.553
and 567 individual properties
in Amsterdam,

01:25:12.095 --> 01:25:15.307
as well as the millions of guilders
stowed in the floorboards of your home.

01:25:15.390 --> 01:25:16.642
Does that sound correct?

01:25:17.476 --> 01:25:18.477
I suppose so.

01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:21.313
For the record, Your Honor,
most of Van Meegeren's real estate

01:25:21.396 --> 01:25:23.482
was bought during the German occupation,

01:25:23.565 --> 01:25:26.944
after the sale
of <i>Christ and the Adulteress.</i>

01:25:28.111 --> 01:25:32.366
Now, did your former husband ever intimate

01:25:32.449 --> 01:25:35.953
that the pictures he sold
by Vermeer, Hals, de Hooch,

01:25:36.787 --> 01:25:39.039
were actually painted by his own hand?

01:25:39.122 --> 01:25:39.957
No.

01:25:40.874 --> 01:25:43.919
Though, if anyone could do it,
it would be him.

01:25:44.795 --> 01:25:47.798
He is relentless
once he has an idea in his mind.

01:25:48.715 --> 01:25:52.636
His artistic talents, I believe,
are second to none.

01:25:53.178 --> 01:25:54.221
He is a genius.

01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:57.432
Do you recognize this photograph?

01:25:59.142 --> 01:26:02.062
It's from a party we hosted
shortly before our divorce.

01:26:06.358 --> 01:26:08.569
Germans attended your parties often.

01:26:11.446 --> 01:26:13.198
Rarely but it did happen.

01:26:13.282 --> 01:26:14.825
- Thank you.
- They were everywhere.

01:26:33.093 --> 01:26:36.555
<i>Were you married to him
when he joined the National Unity Party?</i>

01:26:36.638 --> 01:26:37.681
Yes, we were.

01:26:38.307 --> 01:26:40.350
Please tell us why he joined.

01:26:41.476 --> 01:26:42.853
It was a long time ago.

01:26:43.604 --> 01:26:47.316
Painting portraits was one of the few ways
an artist could make a living.

01:26:48.066 --> 01:26:51.445
And was your husband a believer
in the party's doctrine?

01:26:51.528 --> 01:26:57.075
My ex-husband is apolitical,
agnostic, apathetic.

01:26:57.951 --> 01:27:01.163
I can think of a few other adjectives...

01:27:02.122 --> 01:27:04.917
- but here is not the place for them.
- Thank you.

01:27:08.420 --> 01:27:10.589
<i>You are Van Meegeren's assistant?</i>

01:27:10.672 --> 01:27:11.632
I am.

01:27:11.715 --> 01:27:13.592
And also his mistress.

01:27:14.843 --> 01:27:19.723
We're... friendly,
both professionally and personally.

01:27:19.806 --> 01:27:22.142
- You were a confidante for years.
- Yes.

01:27:22.893 --> 01:27:27.898
Would you describe Mr. Van Meegeren
as a bit of a showman,

01:27:27.981 --> 01:27:30.609
someone that wanted
to be seen, recognized?

01:27:31.527 --> 01:27:32.694
What artist isn't?

01:27:34.655 --> 01:27:37.574
Did you ever witness Han forge
a Vermeer painting?

01:27:38.659 --> 01:27:39.493
Yes, I did.

01:27:40.702 --> 01:27:41.537
Many times.

01:27:42.704 --> 01:27:45.666
Did you know that he then sold them
for exorbitant sums?

01:27:45.749 --> 01:27:48.794
- Of course.
- That would make you an accomplice.

01:27:50.045 --> 01:27:51.129
I understand.

01:27:53.507 --> 01:27:56.176
What about this one?
Did you see him paint it?

01:27:56.885 --> 01:28:00.264
- I did.
- In 1939, at his studio in Amsterdam.

01:28:00.347 --> 01:28:01.181
Yes.

01:28:02.349 --> 01:28:08.105
Han Van Meegeren spent all of 1939
at his villa in France.

01:28:08.188 --> 01:28:11.108
- If I didn't see that one...
- No further questions.

01:28:13.652 --> 01:28:14.695
Mr. Piller?

01:28:16.530 --> 01:28:18.615
Questions for Mrs. Henning?

01:28:21.535 --> 01:28:22.619
No.

01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:26.123
We will adjourn until tomorrow.

01:28:44.349 --> 01:28:45.934
Proceed, Mr. Piller.

01:28:46.894 --> 01:28:50.689
Your Honor,
we have one final piece of evidence.

01:28:52.065 --> 01:28:53.817
Very well but get on with it.

01:29:07.122 --> 01:29:10.250
We call Dirk Hannema to the stand.

01:29:20.177 --> 01:29:23.430
Mr. Hannema,
do you recognize this painting?

01:29:23.513 --> 01:29:27.601
Yes, it was brought to me recently
for analysis

01:29:28.393 --> 01:29:30.979
by the office of the Allied Command.

01:29:31.063 --> 01:29:32.689
And what was your opinion of it?

01:29:33.690 --> 01:29:38.820
Well, I subjected it
to the usual tests and scrutiny...

01:29:38.904 --> 01:29:41.031
I have your written statement here.

01:29:42.491 --> 01:29:47.287
"The painting tentatively titled
<i>Boy Jesus in the Temple</i>

01:29:47.871 --> 01:29:52.501
is likely an early work
in Vermeer's lost biblical series.

01:29:53.502 --> 01:29:58.924
The work is estimated to be 280 years old

01:29:59.675 --> 01:30:01.927
and is a major and important find."

01:30:03.428 --> 01:30:06.265
- You wrote that?
- Indeed. And I stand by it.

01:30:06.348 --> 01:30:09.726
You didn't spend very long
analyzing it, did you?

01:30:10.394 --> 01:30:12.563
It was clearly part
of the biblical series.

01:30:12.646 --> 01:30:14.565
I was able to expedite the process...

01:30:14.648 --> 01:30:16.149
It should be noted, Your Honor,

01:30:16.233 --> 01:30:20.320
that Mr. Hannema has already
put in a bid for this painting,

01:30:20.404 --> 01:30:23.240
hoping to acquire it
for the Boijmans Gallery.

01:30:23.323 --> 01:30:24.449
And why is that relevant?

01:30:25.409 --> 01:30:29.454
Your Honor, this painting
is not even 1 year old.

01:30:30.455 --> 01:30:33.584
It was painted by Han Van Meegeren
while in my custody

01:30:33.667 --> 01:30:35.502
at the Goudstikker Gallery.

01:30:35.586 --> 01:30:37.254
That's utter nonsense.

01:30:37.337 --> 01:30:41.091
My associates and I were there
for the entire creation,

01:30:41.174 --> 01:30:45.637
start till finish,
not knowing its purpose at the time.

01:30:45.721 --> 01:30:49.725
Mr. Van Meegeren painted this painting
to try and save his life.

01:30:49.808 --> 01:30:54.396
Are you saying that you then submitted it
to Mr. Hannema for verification?

01:30:54.479 --> 01:30:59.610
No, my assistant, Minna Holmberg, did,
through the Allied Command.

01:30:59.693 --> 01:31:02.613
But not until the process
had been completed in full.

01:31:02.696 --> 01:31:03.780
What does that mean?

01:31:03.864 --> 01:31:06.825
That means that Mr. Van Meegeren
painted the painting,

01:31:06.909 --> 01:31:11.205
and Mr. Dekker and I assisted him
in aging it.

01:31:11.914 --> 01:31:13.624
The process is quite intricate,

01:31:13.707 --> 01:31:17.002
but, as you can see,
it is very convincing.

01:31:17.085 --> 01:31:19.171
Another fantastic story!

01:31:19.254 --> 01:31:22.174
Your Honor, if I may,
I would ask the court to observe

01:31:22.257 --> 01:31:26.094
the second figure on the left
is in fact Captain Joseph Piller,

01:31:26.178 --> 01:31:30.182
my jailer, whom I painted
in the style of Vermeer.

01:31:33.227 --> 01:31:34.394
Quiet!

01:31:34.478 --> 01:31:36.939
There is some likeness
between Mr. Piller and the subject,

01:31:37.022 --> 01:31:37.981
but is that proof?

01:31:38.065 --> 01:31:39.858
It could be purely coincidental.

01:31:39.942 --> 01:31:42.653
- You need your eyes tested.
- Mr. Van Meegeren!

01:31:42.736 --> 01:31:44.738
You might find in this courtroom
several men,

01:31:44.821 --> 01:31:47.282
who, with some cloth on their head,
resemble this disciple.

01:31:47.366 --> 01:31:50.369
Your Honor, there is enough here

01:31:50.452 --> 01:31:54.498
to warrant a more radical
and foolproof test.

01:31:54.581 --> 01:31:57.834
Please, take a tiny scraping
of this painting

01:31:57.918 --> 01:32:02.005
and test it for the presence
of phenol formaldehyde or Bakelite,

01:32:02.673 --> 01:32:05.175
a compound invented
less than 40 years ago.

01:32:05.259 --> 01:32:06.593
We don't need...

01:32:09.054 --> 01:32:10.389
In my chambers.

01:32:10.472 --> 01:32:12.516
Even if Van Meegeren
did paint that thing,

01:32:12.599 --> 01:32:16.645
it doesn't mean that Göring's Vermeer,
for which he stands trial, is a fake.

01:32:16.728 --> 01:32:19.523
Test both paintings. Test all of them.

01:32:19.606 --> 01:32:23.735
These are priceless cultural treasures,
and to deface them is totally...

01:32:23.819 --> 01:32:26.697
Your Honor,
you're talking about paintings.

01:32:26.780 --> 01:32:29.950
I'm talking about a man's life.

01:32:30.742 --> 01:32:34.204
I... am not persuaded.

01:32:34.288 --> 01:32:36.832
This isn't a trial. This is a stage play.

01:32:36.915 --> 01:32:39.626
Someone who just wants
Van Meegeren out of the way.

01:32:39.710 --> 01:32:41.962
Someone whose wife he slept with.

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:44.673
Someone who didn't get
a good cut of bacon.

01:32:44.756 --> 01:32:47.092
- Oh, please.
- Let me tell you this.

01:32:50.679 --> 01:32:55.267
They're persuaded,
and when they hear the full truth,

01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:58.353
after you've thrown Van Meegeren
to the wolves,

01:32:58.437 --> 01:33:00.606
they will be coming for you next.

01:33:01.607 --> 01:33:03.442
Are you threatening me?

01:33:03.525 --> 01:33:06.195
Yes, you're goddamn right I am.

01:33:07.654 --> 01:33:10.574
You jumped-up spiv.

01:33:12.534 --> 01:33:15.621
Now, consider this a first...

01:33:16.330 --> 01:33:18.707
and final warning.

01:33:26.215 --> 01:33:27.925
You've been played, Piller.

01:33:28.759 --> 01:33:32.262
Van Meegeren is the magician
and you're his greatest trick.

01:33:32.346 --> 01:33:34.389
Maybe this case is all about you.

01:33:34.973 --> 01:33:36.934
Did you get a taste for the good life?

01:33:37.517 --> 01:33:39.811
You think he's gonna give you
a pile of cash

01:33:39.895 --> 01:33:42.022
to secure your family's future?

01:33:42.105 --> 01:33:44.149
Good luck with the verdict!

01:33:45.442 --> 01:33:47.903
That deliberation is not gonna
take very long, is it?

01:33:48.987 --> 01:33:50.781
I think we'd stand a chance.

01:33:52.533 --> 01:33:54.201
They believed that painting.

01:33:55.786 --> 01:33:57.496
Look at all these people.

01:34:00.541 --> 01:34:01.583
They need a win.

01:34:45.252 --> 01:34:49.339
Upon careful consideration
of all the facts presented,

01:34:50.924 --> 01:34:53.802
it is the unanimous conclusion
of this court...

01:34:55.053 --> 01:34:56.889
that Han Van Meegeren...

01:34:57.890 --> 01:35:02.019
is guilty of wartime collaboration
with the enemy.

01:35:03.645 --> 01:35:05.814
And I hereby sentence to...

01:35:08.025 --> 01:35:09.193
Quiet!

01:35:09.276 --> 01:35:12.404
And I hereby sentence him to death.

01:35:13.488 --> 01:35:14.489
Quiet!

01:35:19.036 --> 01:35:20.162
He doesn't deserve that!

01:35:22.164 --> 01:35:24.249
Order! Silence!

01:35:27.669 --> 01:35:28.879
Come on!

01:35:41.016 --> 01:35:42.059
Piller!

01:35:43.393 --> 01:35:44.478
What is he doing?

01:35:48.774 --> 01:35:50.526
Stop him! Stop him!

01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:59.326
"H.V.M."

01:36:00.285 --> 01:36:05.123
Han Van Meegeren.
This painting... is a fake.

01:36:05.207 --> 01:36:06.959
They're all fakes.

01:36:10.796 --> 01:36:12.047
Only one minute ago,

01:36:12.130 --> 01:36:15.259
these paintings were considered
sublime and priceless.

01:36:15.717 --> 01:36:19.221
Now they are worthless
and not one brushstroke has changed.

01:36:25.686 --> 01:36:26.687
Quiet!

01:37:41.887 --> 01:37:44.306
You kids don't know how to drink anymore.

01:37:45.098 --> 01:37:46.099
Another round.

01:37:47.893 --> 01:37:49.228
Who are you calling a kid?

01:37:51.688 --> 01:37:52.522
Thank you.

01:39:50.515 --> 01:39:51.516
Surprise.

01:39:54.102 --> 01:39:56.313
May I come in, just for one minute?

01:40:01.235 --> 01:40:02.236
Thank you.

01:40:09.243 --> 01:40:11.036
Congratulations are in order.

01:40:11.119 --> 01:40:13.747
Please don't tell me you're here
to give me the Medal of Merit.

01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:16.792
No, no, no.
I'm here, actually, to give you this.

01:40:18.252 --> 01:40:19.545
A souvenir.

01:40:19.628 --> 01:40:22.798
My assistant came across it
when we were packing up the gallery.

01:40:22.881 --> 01:40:25.259
It's a collection of Van Meegeren's art.

01:40:27.177 --> 01:40:31.181
Yes, I know it. The Americans found it
in Hitler's private library.

01:40:32.015 --> 01:40:33.976
The dedication page might interest you.

01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:51.869
The people have their hero.

01:40:55.747 --> 01:40:58.292
I'm done with this case,
but what about you?

01:41:10.095 --> 01:41:13.098
We are so pleased you came, Joe.

01:41:14.016 --> 01:41:17.644
Joseph, look at this.
Look at the light on their faces.

01:41:18.395 --> 01:41:20.772
Our story is all over the world.

01:41:20.856 --> 01:41:24.276
We have given Holland wings to rise
from the ashes.

01:41:25.152 --> 01:41:27.112
A victory over darkness.

01:41:28.655 --> 01:41:30.240
People want more life again.

01:41:31.158 --> 01:41:34.578
They want to laugh,
to drink, to have hope.

01:41:34.661 --> 01:41:36.747
They want to dream of a better day.

01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:39.583
And thanks to you, they can and they will.

01:41:40.751 --> 01:41:44.421
You got what you wanted.
You enabled them to see the truth.

01:41:44.504 --> 01:41:46.757
And here it is,
in beautiful black and white.

01:41:49.092 --> 01:41:51.011
You're quite the hero, it seems.

01:41:51.595 --> 01:41:54.723
I suppose this is more adulation
than even you imagined.

01:41:54.806 --> 01:41:58.227
Are you kidding me?
I always imagined it. Please sit down.

01:42:03.941 --> 01:42:06.568
Listen... Joseph.

01:42:07.486 --> 01:42:11.365
I never could have trusted anyone
in the way I trusted you.

01:42:12.574 --> 01:42:13.909
I hope you understand that.

01:42:15.202 --> 01:42:18.872
{\an8}Perhaps, then,
you can help me understand this.

01:42:26.171 --> 01:42:28.340
{\an8}"To my beloved Führer,

01:42:29.424 --> 01:42:31.385
in grateful tribute.

01:42:31.468 --> 01:42:33.387
Han Van Meegeren."

01:42:34.012 --> 01:42:36.932
Very touching gift to Adolf Hitler

01:42:37.641 --> 01:42:41.103
from Holland's most famous hater
of the Nazis.

01:42:47.734 --> 01:42:51.864
In the colonies of yesteryear,
we were the Nazis, yeah?

01:42:51.947 --> 01:42:55.075
We raped, we murdered, we took slaves.

01:42:55.158 --> 01:42:57.494
We even threw babies onto fires.

01:42:58.328 --> 01:43:02.165
And the statues of the men
who led to those glorious exploits

01:43:02.249 --> 01:43:04.334
stand proudly in our public spaces.

01:43:05.168 --> 01:43:09.590
The tide comes in, the tide goes out.
And we do what we can to survive.

01:43:11.341 --> 01:43:12.759
To keep the hope alive.

01:43:13.677 --> 01:43:15.679
In all our glorious colors,

01:43:16.638 --> 01:43:18.098
including gray.

01:43:20.392 --> 01:43:23.020
Bravo. To art.

01:43:29.234 --> 01:43:31.570
I never really cared about art.

01:43:31.653 --> 01:43:34.990
But now I know
that all truly great artists

01:43:35.073 --> 01:43:39.870
bravely walk through the fire of critics
and doubting sheep

01:43:40.412 --> 01:43:42.331
to claim their place in history.

01:43:42.998 --> 01:43:45.042
And that is black and white.

01:43:45.125 --> 01:43:48.212
And that is why the merchants place
such high value on art.

01:43:48.962 --> 01:43:54.343
They get to possess their own small piece
of an incorruptible soul.

01:43:56.345 --> 01:43:59.598
But you could have claimed
your place in history as an artist.

01:44:01.391 --> 01:44:05.729
Your own name and right next
to Hals, Rembrandt, Vermeer even.

01:44:06.521 --> 01:44:10.192
God gave you all the talent in the world.

01:44:12.361 --> 01:44:14.488
Yet you went and wasted it all away.

01:44:15.864 --> 01:44:18.575
Guess you weren't brave enough
to walk through the fire.

01:44:31.630 --> 01:44:32.714
Joseph, please.

01:44:34.091 --> 01:44:36.468
I did trust you, I did.

01:44:38.178 --> 01:44:39.972
That's why I stood up for you.

01:44:41.807 --> 01:44:43.809
And it almost cost me everything.

01:44:51.108 --> 01:44:52.568
Enjoy your victory, Han.

01:44:55.737 --> 01:44:56.738
Our victory.
