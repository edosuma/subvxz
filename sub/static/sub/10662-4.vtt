00:04.261 --> 00:05.428
Well, this is bad.

00:05.429 --> 00:07.330
This is really, really bad.

00:07.331 --> 00:10.099
No, it's not great.

00:10.100 --> 00:11.701
You're sure the condom broke?

00:11.702 --> 00:13.736
Oh, yeah, I'm sure the condom broke.

00:13.737 --> 00:16.706
But could we maybe take a second to,

00:16.707 --> 00:19.008
I don't know, celebrate this?

00:19.009 --> 00:20.810
Celebrate?

00:20.811 --> 00:22.011
Yeah, look, Maxine.

00:22.012 --> 00:23.379
I've never broken a condom before.

00:23.380 --> 00:25.982
It's my first time, and it's
kind of a big deal for me.

00:25.983 --> 00:28.418
And I feel, like,
really strong right now.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.520
This must be how Bruce Banner felt

00:30.521 --> 00:32.722
when he became the Incredible Hulk.

00:32.723 --> 00:35.925
Oh, calm down. I'm sure
the condom was just expired.

00:35.926 --> 00:39.228
So should I not buy condoms
from The Dollar Store anymore?

00:39.229 --> 00:42.365
Maxine, look.

00:42.366 --> 00:45.334
I just want you to know that
whatever you decide,

00:45.335 --> 00:46.702
I'm on board, okay?

00:46.703 --> 00:48.337
It's your body, it's your choice.

00:48.338 --> 00:51.307
I'm just here to support you.
There are no wrong answers.

00:51.308 --> 00:53.042
And everything's going to be fine.

00:53.043 --> 00:54.343
Yeah, I know we're going to be fine,

00:54.344 --> 00:55.645
because we're going to go to CVS

00:55.646 --> 00:57.080
and we're going to get a Plan B pill.

00:57.081 --> 00:59.015
(sighs)

00:59.016 --> 01:00.550
You don't know how happy that makes me.

01:00.551 --> 01:04.187
God, emergency contraception
is always the answer.

01:04.188 --> 01:06.322
You're the best girlfriend
ever, Maxine. Thank you.

01:06.323 --> 01:07.323
Okay, let's go.

01:07.324 --> 01:09.058
All right. Oh, man.

01:09.059 --> 01:11.561
You know, I don't care
if they ever cure cancer,

01:11.562 --> 01:12.929
'cause science has done enough.

01:12.930 --> 01:15.598
They cured pregnancy,
and that's a hard thing to do.

01:15.599 --> 01:18.701
It's so amazing... all we got
to do is just take a pill.

01:18.702 --> 01:21.971
We? We're not cutting the pill
in half and going splitzies.

01:21.972 --> 01:23.806
Fair enough.

01:23.807 --> 01:25.708
It's the women's job to take the pill.

01:25.709 --> 01:27.410
But it's the man's job
to watch anxiously

01:27.411 --> 01:30.213
and then check underneath your tongue.

01:30.214 --> 01:34.217
Okay. Well, let's go.

01:34.218 --> 01:35.251
All right.

01:35.252 --> 01:36.886
I don't know, Maxine.

01:36.887 --> 01:38.921
You sure we should go out?
It's a pretty bad storm.

01:38.922 --> 01:41.357
Like, you have to take it
within the first 72 hours,

01:41.358 --> 01:43.559
and the sooner you take it
the more effective it is.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.928
Plus, I am way more scared of the storm

01:45.929 --> 01:47.930
that may be brewing
in my uterus right now.

01:47.931 --> 01:49.665
Fair enough.

01:49.666 --> 01:52.535
I got to ask... how do you
know so much about Plan B?

01:52.536 --> 01:55.171
Because I'm an adult, Jerrod.

01:55.172 --> 01:56.706
I'm an adult, too.

01:56.707 --> 01:58.508
I broke a condom today.

How can CVS close at a time like this?

02:21.329 --> 02:23.029
Don't they know people
are stuck out there

02:23.030 --> 02:26.900
with no food or water or Plan B pills?

02:26.901 --> 02:29.202
What the hell are y'all doing out here?

02:29.203 --> 02:30.804
I don't know if you're aware of this,

02:30.805 --> 02:32.939
but they got gale force
winds out there.

02:32.940 --> 02:35.809
Yeah, we went to CVS, but it
shut down 'cause of the storm.

02:35.810 --> 02:37.277
Yeah, tress are knocked down,

02:37.278 --> 02:38.445
entire streets are flooded.

02:38.446 --> 02:40.146
We could barely see more
than a foot ahead of us,

02:40.147 --> 02:41.648
so we had to stop here.

02:41.649 --> 02:43.450
CYNTHIA: Joe, who are you
talking to up there?

02:43.451 --> 02:45.318
Jerrod and Maxine just walked in!

02:45.319 --> 02:50.490
Don't they know about the
gale force winds outside?

02:50.491 --> 02:53.827
Yeah, Mom, we know about
the gale force winds outside.

02:53.828 --> 02:55.888
Yeah, we gotta get to the basement.

02:58.766 --> 03:00.734
Dad, what are you
grabbing your gun for?

03:00.735 --> 03:02.669
Boy, you got to be prepared.

03:02.670 --> 03:05.138
I'm I the only one that learned
something from Katrina?

03:09.010 --> 03:12.712
Hey, Mom, we got some
sliced green beans,

03:12.713 --> 03:15.615
uh, some cream of mushroom...

03:15.616 --> 03:18.418
and some type of meat in a can.

03:20.054 --> 03:23.790
I've seen Paula Deen do more with less.

03:23.791 --> 03:27.294
I'm just glad that black people
finally got the big picture

03:27.295 --> 03:29.296
and they let her back on television.

03:29.297 --> 03:31.498
If somebody stopped me from cooking

03:31.499 --> 03:33.266
every time I used that word,

03:33.267 --> 03:36.870
y'all would have starved to death.

03:36.871 --> 03:39.339
Y'all plan on being
down here for a long time?

03:39.340 --> 03:41.708
Oh, yes. We could be
down here a couple of days.

03:41.709 --> 03:42.976
For a couple days?

03:42.977 --> 03:44.778
We can't be stuck down
here for a couple days.

03:44.779 --> 03:47.113
Yeah, they can't keep the CVS
closed for a couple days, right?

03:47.114 --> 03:49.049
This is America.

03:49.050 --> 03:52.485
CVS? What's so important
at CVS that couldn't wait?

03:53.621 --> 03:56.489
Okay, something's up right here.

03:56.490 --> 03:59.993
Let's see what we got.

03:59.994 --> 04:03.196
A couple rushing to CVS...

04:03.197 --> 04:05.532
in the middle...

04:05.533 --> 04:07.434
of a storm.

04:09.270 --> 04:11.738
JERROD: Look, Bobby. Save your energy.

04:11.739 --> 04:13.540
Our business is our business,

04:13.541 --> 04:16.009
and you're making Maxine and I
very uncomfortable right now.

04:16.010 --> 04:18.911
Oh, so Maxine's uncomfortable.

04:18.913 --> 04:20.647
Uh-huh.

04:22.683 --> 04:25.252
Dad, what was the last thing
you rushed to CVS for?

04:25.253 --> 04:26.653
My buddy Bernard texted me,

04:26.654 --> 04:28.855
said he saw Cam Newton
at the drug store.

04:28.856 --> 04:30.624
So I came home,

04:30.625 --> 04:32.492
threw my jersey on and grabbed
my digital camera.

04:32.493 --> 04:34.261
Head on over there,
I went to the wrong CVS.

04:34.262 --> 04:38.565
See, no, Jerrod is not
into sports like that.

04:38.566 --> 04:42.702
Yeah. Mom, what was the last
thing you rushed to CVS for?

04:42.703 --> 04:44.638
Cinnamon-flavored Trident.

04:44.639 --> 04:48.241
But they didn't have any
in stock, so I went over

04:48.242 --> 04:50.610
to the cashier and I said,
"Hey, you don't have

04:50.611 --> 04:52.746
no cinnamon-flavored Trident.
What's up with that?"

04:52.747 --> 04:55.215
Well, she looked at me

04:55.216 --> 04:57.550
like there was nothing
she could do to help me.

04:57.551 --> 04:59.686
She needed an attitude adjustment.

04:59.687 --> 05:04.591
But Jerrod wouldn't rush
to no CVS for no gum.

05:06.627 --> 05:08.695
Pregnancy test. Maxine's pregnant.

05:08.696 --> 05:10.931
(Cynthia shrieks)

05:10.932 --> 05:12.465
Maxine, you pregnant?!

05:12.466 --> 05:15.402
What? That's... What?

05:15.403 --> 05:16.870
Oh, she pregnant paused.
She's pregnant.

05:16.871 --> 05:18.471
That's where the term comes from.

05:18.472 --> 05:20.140
When you ask a pregnant
woman if she's pregnant,

05:20.141 --> 05:22.842
she pauses, thus... pregnant pause.

05:22.843 --> 05:25.312
Well, if you're not going to tell us,

05:25.313 --> 05:27.647
I'm going to have to take
control of the situation.

05:27.648 --> 05:30.250
I can always tell when
somebody's pregnant,

05:30.251 --> 05:32.819
just by touching their stomach.

05:32.820 --> 05:34.120
Come here, Maxine.

05:34.121 --> 05:36.456
No, I'm good.

05:37.525 --> 05:40.226
Mom, weren't you banned
from a church for doing this?

05:40.227 --> 05:42.228
Jerrod, let your momma do her work.

05:42.229 --> 05:43.630
You know she's got the gift.

05:43.631 --> 05:45.565
What... (stammers)

05:45.566 --> 05:48.268
(humming)

05:48.269 --> 05:53.373
(melodic vocalizing)

05:53.374 --> 05:54.407
(gasps)

05:54.408 --> 05:56.743
Maxine ain't got no vibes.

05:56.744 --> 05:57.911
I don't get nothing.

05:57.912 --> 06:01.514
I ain't never met nobody
that had no vibes.

06:01.515 --> 06:03.216
Look, if you must know...

06:03.217 --> 06:05.518
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What
are you going to tell them?

06:05.519 --> 06:07.621
I was just going
to tell them the truth.

06:07.622 --> 06:10.090
Well, how are you going to say it?

06:10.091 --> 06:11.892
I don't know, I was
probably going to use

06:11.893 --> 06:14.553
the whole Incredible Hulk thing.

06:15.429 --> 06:16.963
No, no. Let me... Let me do this.

06:16.964 --> 06:18.265
(exhales deeply)

06:18.266 --> 06:21.968
Jerrod and I had a sexual accident.

06:27.675 --> 06:29.409
Did you pull something, son?

06:29.410 --> 06:32.045
'Cause I told you, you got
to practice like you play.

06:33.447 --> 06:35.215
Look, look.

06:35.216 --> 06:38.885
There is a slight possibility
that Maxine could be pregnant.

06:38.886 --> 06:39.686
I knew it!

06:39.687 --> 06:41.321
Jerrod, I hate when you

06:41.322 --> 06:42.722
make me fish for information.

06:42.723 --> 06:44.791
You know something,
it makes me not trust you.

06:44.792 --> 06:46.393
It makes me think
you don't want us to be

06:46.394 --> 06:48.862
as close as we should be, as brothers.

06:48.863 --> 06:50.830
And that's on you.

06:52.867 --> 06:56.269
Maxine, you're telling me
I might be a grandmother.

06:56.270 --> 06:59.506
Oh, wow! I got to sit down for this.

06:59.507 --> 07:01.708
Grandma Cynthia.

07:01.709 --> 07:04.544
Ooh, I know it's going to be hell

07:04.545 --> 07:07.948
getting suitable hair products
for the little mixed kid.

07:07.949 --> 07:09.883
But I don't mind,

07:09.884 --> 07:12.586
because I'm going to be taking
care of a precious baby.

07:12.587 --> 07:14.120
"Might" be pregnant.

07:14.121 --> 07:15.822
Now, how far along are we talking?

07:15.823 --> 07:18.525
I don't know. An hour?

07:20.461 --> 07:21.428
An hour?

07:21.429 --> 07:22.529
What kind of scare is that?

07:22.530 --> 07:25.065
People scared too easy these days.

07:25.066 --> 07:26.733
Look, times have changed.

07:26.734 --> 07:27.993
There's nothing scary about this.

07:27.994 --> 07:29.235
We just have to act fast.

07:29.236 --> 07:32.506
Oh, yes, if you're expecting,
we have to act really fast.

07:32.507 --> 07:35.241
In fact, I got my old wedding gown

07:35.242 --> 07:38.144
down here... you can use it, Maxine.

07:38.145 --> 07:40.046
Hey, Jerrod, I'm going to
be your best man, right?

07:40.047 --> 07:41.781
We're not getting married, Bobby.

07:41.782 --> 07:44.684
Look, that's fine if
I'm not your best man,

07:44.685 --> 07:47.220
but don't lie to me.

07:47.221 --> 07:49.389
Don't lie.

07:50.291 --> 07:52.459
Okay. Go, Jerrod. Oh.

07:52.460 --> 07:55.028
Now, this has been over
by the water heater

07:55.029 --> 07:56.563
for what, 30 years.

07:56.564 --> 07:59.432
Which accounts for its off-white color.

07:59.433 --> 08:01.001
But I guess, uh,

08:01.002 --> 08:04.804
given the circumstances,
it's appropriate.

08:06.574 --> 08:08.275
Look, the thought of
having to get married

08:08.276 --> 08:11.077
because of a pregnancy, that's archaic.

08:11.078 --> 08:12.879
In fact, I kind of see the whole

08:12.880 --> 08:14.581
concept of marriage as archaic.

08:14.582 --> 08:17.150
It was created in a time when
women were viewed as property.

08:17.151 --> 08:19.686
Now, I don't need to be
given away by my father

08:19.687 --> 08:21.655
to the possession of another man

08:21.656 --> 08:23.156
just so I can take his last name.

08:23.157 --> 08:25.025
You mean like me?

08:25.026 --> 08:28.595
Or my mother? Or her mother before her?

08:28.596 --> 08:30.697
JOE: Yeah, Maxine.

08:30.698 --> 08:32.332
If marriage isn't so great,

08:32.332 --> 08:33.866
what have all these gay people

08:33.868 --> 08:35.669
been fighting for all these years?

08:35.669 --> 08:37.102
Are you saying

08:37.104 --> 08:39.639
that they just like to complain
for the hell of it, Maxine?

08:39.640 --> 08:42.409
Are you saying, Maxine,

08:42.409 --> 08:45.345
that gay people just
like to make a scene?

08:45.346 --> 08:47.380
Because if that's what you are saying,

08:47.381 --> 08:51.384
I find it incredibly insensitive.

08:51.385 --> 08:54.521
Maxine, if you're pregnant

08:54.522 --> 08:56.122
you need to get married.

08:56.123 --> 08:59.059
Now, Jerrod is my son
and I love him dearly,

08:59.060 --> 09:01.962
but once he hears
that baby crying at 3:00am,

09:01.963 --> 09:04.898
he's a flight risk.

09:04.899 --> 09:06.800
JERROD: All right.

09:06.801 --> 09:08.535
Everybody calm down. Relax.

09:08.536 --> 09:10.370
None of what you're saying
matters anyway,

09:10.371 --> 09:13.440
because Maxine and I
are not having a kid.

09:13.441 --> 09:15.175
They're having an abortion.

09:15.176 --> 09:17.110
Do something, Joe!

09:18.546 --> 09:21.381
Jerrod, don't have an abortion,
you're upsetting your momma.

09:23.551 --> 09:26.086
Hey! (gasping)

09:26.087 --> 09:29.556
Nekeisha. Nekeisha,
where did you come from?

09:29.557 --> 09:31.625
Maxine texted me.

09:31.626 --> 09:34.286
Here. I brought your Plan B.

09:35.196 --> 09:37.163
Well, thank you.
I guess you missed the part

09:37.164 --> 09:38.598
where I said,
"Let's keep this between us."

09:38.599 --> 09:41.301
Oh, I thought that meant,
"Don't post it on Facebook."

09:41.302 --> 09:43.770
Nekeisha, you, uh, you just keep.

09:43.771 --> 09:45.438
Plan B pills laying around your house?

09:45.439 --> 09:46.673
Oh, yeah, I'm a modern woman.

09:46.674 --> 09:50.143
I'm like Mary Tyler Moore with braids.

09:50.144 --> 09:53.446
You see, Cynthia, nobody
is having an abortion.

09:53.447 --> 09:56.016
I just take this pill
and I will avoid pregnancy.

09:56.017 --> 09:58.785
It's just contraception, no
different than using a condom.

09:58.786 --> 10:00.420
Well, it sounds like
you're pulling a condom

10:00.421 --> 10:02.289
over your baby's face.

10:02.290 --> 10:05.625
Ma, Ma, stop acting like
we are killing a baby.

10:05.626 --> 10:06.826
We're not.

10:06.827 --> 10:09.696
We're killing the idea of a baby.

10:11.165 --> 10:12.799
Man, this thing's childproof.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.235
Kind of ironic when you think about it.

10:15.236 --> 10:16.770
They're having a Plan B.

10:16.771 --> 10:18.705
Joe, do something!

10:18.706 --> 10:22.108
So, this B plan, it stops
anything before it gets started?

10:22.109 --> 10:23.176
Mm-hmm.

10:23.177 --> 10:24.477
And you just buy it over the counter?

10:24.478 --> 10:25.245
Yeah.

10:25.246 --> 10:27.247
Well, get out if here.

10:27.248 --> 10:30.517
How much does this scientific
achievement cost?

10:30.518 --> 10:33.119
Joe, who's side are you on here?

10:33.120 --> 10:34.087
It's like 40 bucks.

10:34.088 --> 10:35.388
"40 bucks"?!

10:35.389 --> 10:36.957
Man, something that amazing

10:36.958 --> 10:39.025
should cost like $7,000.

10:42.730 --> 10:45.298
I just don't understand
how y'all can act so casual

10:45.299 --> 10:47.767
about a decision this big.

10:47.768 --> 10:49.169
Cynthia, we're not acting casual.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.104
We're actually doing
the responsible thing.

10:51.105 --> 10:53.173
I know you think this morning
after pill is gonna solve

10:53.174 --> 10:55.442
all of your problems, but what
about the morning after that

10:55.443 --> 10:57.377
when you start feeling regret?

10:57.378 --> 10:59.646
You got a pill for that, Jerrod?

10:59.647 --> 11:02.716
Yeah, Xanax, Zoloft, Paxil,

11:02.717 --> 11:04.551
uh, uh, what is that...?

11:04.552 --> 11:05.685
- Abilify.
- Abilify!

11:05.686 --> 11:06.853
I got that on deck...
you want one? I got it...

11:06.854 --> 11:08.088
I most certainly want one of them.

11:08.089 --> 11:09.723
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.

11:09.724 --> 11:10.924
Jerrod, before you do this,

11:10.925 --> 11:12.492
I got something I need
to tell you, okay?

11:12.493 --> 11:13.860
(sighs)

11:13.861 --> 11:16.062
The Carmichael men got
a low sperm count.

11:16.063 --> 11:17.697
Matter of fact,

11:17.698 --> 11:20.767
we might not have a sperm count at all.

11:20.768 --> 11:22.602
What are you talking about, Bobby?

11:22.603 --> 11:24.571
Me and Nekeisha tried to get
pregnant for years, right?

11:24.572 --> 11:26.306
You know, I thought I could have a baby

11:26.307 --> 11:28.008
that would accomplish
all the things I didn't.

11:28.009 --> 11:30.377
You know, I thought, like,
if Big Bobby can't do it,

11:30.378 --> 11:32.145
then Little Bobby would.

11:32.146 --> 11:34.080
But we'll never know.

11:34.081 --> 11:36.750
Wow, I'm sorry, Bobby.

11:36.751 --> 11:39.519
We never even considered that.

11:39.520 --> 11:42.188
Look, the Carmichael men
can make babies.

11:42.189 --> 11:45.558
Now, I've been referred to by
several doctors as being potent.

11:45.559 --> 11:48.194
Now, that's not a word
they just throw around.

11:48.195 --> 11:49.529
BOBBY: But look, Dad.

11:49.530 --> 11:50.897
Maybe it skipped a
generation, you know?

11:50.898 --> 11:53.633
I just don't want Jerrod
to be as crushed as I was

11:53.634 --> 11:56.236
when I found out I
couldn't have a baby.

11:56.237 --> 11:58.471
Oh, Bobby, no worries about that.

11:58.472 --> 12:00.407
I was on birth control the whole time.

12:00.408 --> 12:01.608
Wait.

12:01.609 --> 12:03.208
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what?!

12:03.209 --> 12:04.644
You was on birth control the whole time

12:04.645 --> 12:05.879
we was trying to get pregnant?

12:05.880 --> 12:07.447
Yeah, to protect you.

12:07.448 --> 12:09.316
I mean, when you look
at the big picture,

12:09.317 --> 12:10.850
we were not in a situation
to be having a baby.

12:10.851 --> 12:13.019
I mean, you didn't have a job,
I didn't have a job.

12:13.020 --> 12:15.522
That's good enough reason right there.

12:15.523 --> 12:17.657
Well, look, this is not a family vote.

12:17.658 --> 12:20.393
This is a two-person decision.

12:20.394 --> 12:22.462
Or in your case, one person.

12:24.966 --> 12:26.967
Now, Bobby, I appreciate
you looking out for us.

12:26.968 --> 12:28.535
Can you open this thing?

12:28.536 --> 12:29.536
Yeah.

12:29.537 --> 12:30.670
CYNTHIA: Jerrod?

12:30.671 --> 12:32.205
How long am I gonna
have to stand around

12:32.206 --> 12:34.608
and watch you two make bad decisions?

12:34.609 --> 12:35.909
I've watched you two

12:35.910 --> 12:37.377
move in together. Fine.

12:37.378 --> 12:39.212
She don't want to get married.

12:39.213 --> 12:40.347
Fine.

12:40.348 --> 12:42.449
But we are talking about a baby here.

12:42.450 --> 12:45.685
And I'm not fine.

12:45.686 --> 12:47.020
Okay, uh, Mom?

12:47.021 --> 12:48.421
Mom, what are you doing?

12:48.422 --> 12:50.523
No! No, no...

12:54.595 --> 12:58.031
I guess you're gonna have
to come up with a plan C.

13:03.404 --> 13:07.073
She never would've flushed it
if it cost $7,000.

13:11.428 --> 13:13.062
Mom, I'm gonna ask this politely.

13:13.063 --> 13:14.931
What the hell did you just do?

13:14.932 --> 13:16.566
I flushed that horrible pill,

13:16.567 --> 13:19.535
so you'll do the right thing
and save my grand-baby.

13:19.536 --> 13:21.938
That I may or may not
even be pregnant with?

13:21.939 --> 13:24.107
Cynthia, you can't flush away
everything you disagree with.

13:24.108 --> 13:27.109
Our pipes can't take it!

13:27.110 --> 13:29.612
Well, won't this be a delightful
birth story for the child?

13:29.613 --> 13:32.281
It was a dark and stormy night,
and your grandma flushed

13:32.282 --> 13:34.784
the plan B pill, so we had
no choice but to have you.

13:34.785 --> 13:36.953
Anyway, happy birthday, son.

13:36.954 --> 13:39.188
You know, Ma?

13:39.189 --> 13:40.823
I could've just lied to you, you know?

13:40.824 --> 13:42.564
I didn't have to tell you
the truth, but I did.

13:42.565 --> 13:43.493
And then what did you do?

13:43.494 --> 13:44.961
You ran around trying
to plan my wedding,

13:44.962 --> 13:47.163
and doing everything
shy of naming the child.

13:47.164 --> 13:49.098
Jeremiah.

13:49.099 --> 13:51.601
I was gonna name him Jeremiah.

13:51.602 --> 13:53.336
No.

13:56.473 --> 13:58.172
Look, Cynthia, I know

13:58.173 --> 13:59.623
that you don't agree
with what we're doing,

13:59.624 --> 14:02.111
but Jerrod and I discussed this
before we even got here.

14:02.112 --> 14:03.755
Yeah, we were making a decision

14:03.756 --> 14:04.981
that was right for the both of us.

14:04.982 --> 14:07.550
Well, what if all of this happened

14:07.551 --> 14:09.152
for a reason?

14:09.153 --> 14:12.054
What if this is
your last chance to have a baby?

14:12.055 --> 14:13.656
You're gonna end up like...

14:13.657 --> 14:14.957
Do not say Jennifer Aniston.

14:14.958 --> 14:16.259
Jennifer Aniston!

14:16.260 --> 14:18.327
Well, you know what, Mom?

14:18.328 --> 14:20.029
Maybe we do.

14:20.030 --> 14:21.264
And maybe we never have kids.

14:21.265 --> 14:22.899
That's just fine with us. Whoa.

14:22.900 --> 14:24.734
I'm not fine with that.

14:24.735 --> 14:27.303
Are you fine with not having kids?

14:27.304 --> 14:29.806
I mean, I said it.

14:29.807 --> 14:31.808
Um...

14:31.809 --> 14:34.377
Clearly,

14:34.378 --> 14:36.479
this is not the place to say it.

14:36.480 --> 14:39.348
So yeah, I guess am cool
with never having kids.

14:39.349 --> 14:41.150
Wow.

14:41.151 --> 14:42.485
I think I'm gonna go take my chances

14:42.486 --> 14:44.720
- out in the storm.
- Maxine...

14:44.721 --> 14:47.790
This has been a most unpleasant day.

14:50.494 --> 14:51.928
Look what you did.

14:51.929 --> 14:53.196
Me?

14:53.197 --> 14:54.630
You know, Ma, let's make a deal.

14:54.631 --> 14:56.399
How about you don't tell me
how to live my life,

14:56.400 --> 14:58.768
and I won't tell you how
to live yours... is that okay?

14:58.769 --> 15:00.770
If I say yes...

15:00.771 --> 15:04.173
then you're telling me
how to live my life.

15:04.174 --> 15:05.274
Look it... You know what?

15:05.275 --> 15:06.975
I'm out. I'm fine.

15:11.682 --> 15:13.549
Look, look, Maxine, Maxine,

15:13.550 --> 15:15.551
I don't want you to be
mad at me, all right?

15:15.552 --> 15:17.086
And I know you think
you want to have kids,

15:17.087 --> 15:20.022
but can we stop and ask
a very important question?

15:20.023 --> 15:21.557
Why?

15:21.558 --> 15:23.126
What do you mean why?

15:23.127 --> 15:25.294
It's kids. It's what people do...

15:25.295 --> 15:27.063
Why wouldn't you want to have kids?

15:27.064 --> 15:29.599
I-I've only seen people
have kids out of like

15:29.600 --> 15:32.101
complete arrogance or utter despair.

15:32.102 --> 15:34.303
Either you think I'm great
and there should be more of me

15:34.304 --> 15:37.240
or you look back over your life,

15:37.241 --> 15:39.942
and realize you never
accomplished any of your goals,

15:39.943 --> 15:43.813
and you go, "Well, I guess
I could have a human being."

15:43.814 --> 15:47.083
It's basically giving up.

15:47.084 --> 15:49.118
So you think your parents
gave up when they had you?

15:49.119 --> 15:51.154
No, I think my parents gave up
when they had Bobby.

15:51.155 --> 15:53.255
Then they gave up on Bobby and had me.

15:55.292 --> 15:57.093
So, what do we do?

15:57.094 --> 15:58.294
I'm sorry.

15:58.295 --> 16:00.296
I love you, but I am
not gonna wait around

16:00.297 --> 16:01.697
and see if you're ready one day.

16:01.698 --> 16:03.966
Maxine, I really don't
want to hurt you or anything,

16:03.967 --> 16:05.835
but it would be a lie if I sat here,

16:05.836 --> 16:07.470
and didn't tell you how I really felt.

16:07.471 --> 16:09.472
(knocking)

16:15.078 --> 16:16.345
Perfect timing.

16:16.346 --> 16:17.480
We've already shared

16:17.481 --> 16:19.916
so many intimate moments today,
why stop now?

16:21.318 --> 16:22.518
What are you two doing here?

16:22.519 --> 16:24.887
Um...

16:24.888 --> 16:28.524
well, um...

16:28.525 --> 16:30.126
it's been called to my attention

16:30.127 --> 16:32.729
that I may have overstepped my bounds.

16:32.730 --> 16:34.397
And, um,

16:34.398 --> 16:37.166
I came to apologize
for flushing your pill

16:37.167 --> 16:39.502
and-and say that it's your life,

16:39.503 --> 16:42.705
and I apparently have no right
to tell you how to live it.

16:42.706 --> 16:44.574
That's very good, honey.

16:44.575 --> 16:47.235
See, rehearsing in the car paid off.

16:48.812 --> 16:49.912
So, what's happening here?

16:49.913 --> 16:51.881
Y'all still having your little fight?

16:51.882 --> 16:53.483
Well, Jerrod doesn't
want kids and I do,

16:53.484 --> 16:55.818
so that's where we're at.

16:55.819 --> 16:57.653
Then, Maxine, don't take that pill.

16:57.654 --> 16:59.422
You don't need Jerrod

16:59.423 --> 17:00.490
to have a baby.

17:00.491 --> 17:02.692
His part is over.

17:03.894 --> 17:06.162
We can raise that baby just you and me

17:06.163 --> 17:07.630
together.

17:07.631 --> 17:09.098
We'll take him walking.

17:09.098 --> 17:10.532
We'll sing him to sleep.

17:10.534 --> 17:11.901
Oh, and we'll just smell

17:11.902 --> 17:14.837
that little fresh baby head.

17:14.838 --> 17:19.075
Look, son, I know you said
you don't want kids.

17:19.076 --> 17:21.010
But do you think maybe
that's 'cause you're scared?

17:21.011 --> 17:22.712
I-I just don't want
my freedom inhibited.

17:22.713 --> 17:25.080
I want to travel.
I want to see the world.

17:25.082 --> 17:26.182
See the world?

17:26.183 --> 17:27.250
You live in America.

17:27.251 --> 17:28.550
You got the world right here.

17:28.551 --> 17:29.685
What?

17:29.686 --> 17:30.920
They got Chinatown in New York.

17:30.921 --> 17:33.222
They got that Eiffel Tower in Vegas.

17:33.223 --> 17:35.525
Shoot, we got so many
Syrians running around here

17:35.526 --> 17:36.926
we don't know what to do with.

17:36.927 --> 17:40.463
Jerrod, you need to hear this.

17:40.464 --> 17:43.966
Life is boring.

17:43.967 --> 17:46.569
See, you're young,
you think life is too short.

17:46.570 --> 17:49.272
No. Life is too long.

17:50.741 --> 17:53.543
Fill the time, go have kids.

17:53.544 --> 17:55.978
Look, I get why kids could be amazing,

17:55.979 --> 17:57.513
but I don't think I should have them

17:57.514 --> 17:58.748
unless I really, really want them.

17:58.749 --> 18:00.249
You know, the first time your momma,

18:00.250 --> 18:02.084
she told me she was
pregnant with Bobby,

18:02.085 --> 18:04.253
I kissed her and I told her

18:04.254 --> 18:06.322
she made me the happiest man
in the world.

18:06.323 --> 18:07.790
Then I got in my truck

18:07.791 --> 18:09.225
and I cried.

18:09.226 --> 18:10.893
Drove around for hours.

18:10.894 --> 18:15.231
Wound up eating a bag
of cereal at the cemetery.

18:15.232 --> 18:18.000
So when you came back hours
later with those flowers,

18:18.001 --> 18:20.470
were they from a grave?

18:20.471 --> 18:23.473
Well...

18:23.474 --> 18:26.909
the point is, sometimes fear
isn't necessarily a bad thing.

18:28.145 --> 18:30.246
If you don't feel like
crying in your truck

18:30.247 --> 18:31.647
before you're about to do something,

18:31.648 --> 18:33.649
maybe it's not worth doing.

18:33.650 --> 18:35.752
Well, that's beautiful, Joe.

18:35.753 --> 18:38.054
You know, it's not like
I don't have my own fears

18:38.055 --> 18:41.457
about becoming a mother, and I'm
sure Cynthia felt the same way.

18:41.458 --> 18:43.927
Nope, I never felt that.

18:43.928 --> 18:47.763
I mean, it's my baby, why would
I be afraid to have him?

18:47.764 --> 18:49.499
She is trying to connect with you.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.160
I don't understand her.

18:55.772 --> 18:59.509
I mean, Maxine, am I
a little afraid? Yeah.

18:59.510 --> 19:01.644
But neither one of us
wants kids right now,

19:01.645 --> 19:02.845
maybe that's all that matters.

19:02.846 --> 19:04.714
I mean, who knows
what the future holds?

19:04.715 --> 19:06.415
It holds kids.

19:06.416 --> 19:08.751
I'll try really, really
hard to be open.

19:08.752 --> 19:11.988
I really will, because I don't
know if I'll ever want kids,

19:11.989 --> 19:14.957
but I know I'll always want you.

19:14.958 --> 19:16.893
Mm.

19:18.262 --> 19:20.396
Yeah, I don't want kids today.

19:20.397 --> 19:23.232
And being a mother is the
hardest job in the world.

19:23.233 --> 19:24.834
I don't know, it's tough,

19:24.835 --> 19:28.070
but it's not like
we're on <i> The Deadliest Catch.</i>

19:31.565 --> 19:36.169
Right. Boom.

19:36.170 --> 19:40.207
Maxine, you are a very strong,

19:40.208 --> 19:42.074
very independent woman,

19:42.075 --> 19:45.211
and I just want you to know
that we're in this together.

19:45.212 --> 19:46.592
Any way, bon appétit.

19:47.748 --> 19:49.181
Ah, Plan B.

19:49.182 --> 19:51.050
The breakfast of champions.

19:51.051 --> 19:52.952
Oh, just so you know,
I made that a mimosa

19:52.953 --> 19:54.973
'cause, you know, you're not pregnant.

19:57.858 --> 19:59.959
Can you settle a debate for us?

19:59.960 --> 20:02.261
It's why we woke up this morning.

20:02.262 --> 20:04.230
What's up, guys?

20:04.231 --> 20:05.727
Now, you remember
when Nekeisha admitted

20:05.728 --> 20:06.778
that she was on birth control

20:06.779 --> 20:07.967
when I was trying to get her pregnant.

20:07.968 --> 20:09.480
You know, when we all
were stuck in the basement.

20:09.481 --> 20:10.736
You mean yesterday.

20:10.737 --> 20:13.072
Are you asking me if I remember
yesterday? 'Cause yeah.

20:13.073 --> 20:14.974
Look, let me ask y'all this.

20:14.975 --> 20:19.779
Am I entitled to sue Nekeisha
for pain and suffering?

20:19.780 --> 20:21.647
We're thinking about
taking this to Judge Judy

20:21.648 --> 20:24.517
'cause she is my moral compass.

20:24.518 --> 20:27.098
Ooh, is that the Plan B pill?

20:28.002 --> 20:30.503
Look at y'all, still going
through with it, huh?

20:30.504 --> 20:32.672
Well, let me throw a scenario at you.

20:32.673 --> 20:34.874
Have you thought about adoption?

20:34.875 --> 20:36.376
Think about it.

20:36.377 --> 20:39.429
Uncle-daddy-bobby.

20:39.430 --> 20:42.465
Uncle-daddy-bobby.

20:42.466 --> 20:44.733
Let me have y'all baby.

20:47.638 --> 20:49.178
Maxine, take the pill.

20:49.179 --> 20:49.887
On it.

20:50.067 --> 20:52.838
