WEBVTT

00:35.110 --> 00:40.490
THE COUNTERFEITERS

01:08.477 --> 01:12.439
THE WAR IS OVER

01:23.200 --> 01:25.702
BEAUTIFUL SHORE

02:21.425 --> 02:22.592
Monsieur Sorowitsch?

02:22.676 --> 02:24.928
I'm afraid we require a deposit.

02:35.647 --> 02:38.233
$200 is more than enough.

02:47.242 --> 02:49.494
Is this your first visit
to Monte Carlo?

03:07.804 --> 03:10.432
Excellent.
That's going to be fine.

03:10.515 --> 03:12.684
Little adjustment here, that's all.

03:36.958 --> 03:39.628
PRIVATE ROOM

03:51.014 --> 03:52.265
Cheers.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.134
What's that?

04:32.347 --> 04:34.307
You're not from a camp,
are you?

04:59.374 --> 05:00.542
I'm not a...

05:39.080 --> 05:40.248
Sally!

05:47.088 --> 05:48.256
Schmitz!

05:49.591 --> 05:52.177
Where's the other 150?

05:52.260 --> 05:55.430
Know how risky it is
off-loading your duds?

05:55.513 --> 05:56.681
Sally!

06:00.101 --> 06:02.520
Can you lend me something?
Twenty?

06:04.105 --> 06:06.024
Come over all political?

06:06.107 --> 06:08.193
Ludwig here took me along
to a meeting.

06:08.276 --> 06:10.028
Heil! Heil! Heil!

06:10.111 --> 06:13.031
And I've joined them too!

06:13.114 --> 06:14.866
Look!

06:14.950 --> 06:17.535
He gave it to me
'cause I'm so kind to him!

06:17.619 --> 06:19.371
In bed or in the party?

06:21.289 --> 06:22.624
You see, Schmitz...

06:23.625 --> 06:26.336
if I let you cheat me, tomorrow
someone else will cheat me.

06:26.419 --> 06:27.921
Soon they'll all cheat me.

06:28.046 --> 06:31.549
It's not about the 150.
It's a matter of principle.

06:31.633 --> 06:35.303
It's about my very existence,
and for that I could be driven...

06:36.304 --> 06:38.223
to take extreme measures.

06:39.641 --> 06:41.059
Sally, you old crook!

06:41.142 --> 06:43.478
Let me introduce
an old friend of mine!

06:43.603 --> 06:47.565
Sally Sorowitsch, the most
charming scoundrel in Berlin!

06:48.650 --> 06:49.776
Sorowitsch?

06:49.859 --> 06:51.236
Are you Russian?

06:51.319 --> 06:53.905
I hope you're not a Communist?

06:53.989 --> 06:56.741
Enough of a Communist
to share my champagne with you.

06:58.827 --> 07:01.246
Sally -- that's a droll sort of name.

07:01.329 --> 07:02.956
Where does it come from?

07:06.001 --> 07:07.502
It's short for Salomon.

07:09.671 --> 07:10.839
Salomon?

07:16.011 --> 07:19.431
She can spit the champagne back.
It's a Rothschild.

07:26.855 --> 07:28.189
I'm trusting you.

07:32.027 --> 07:35.530
What do they always say?
Don't do business with Jews!

07:38.366 --> 07:41.286
Trying so hard not to be noticed
gets you noticed.

07:41.369 --> 07:43.288
Not learnt that yet
in the Resistance?

07:43.371 --> 07:44.622
I'm sorry, Sally.

07:44.706 --> 07:47.792
- In two hours up at my place.
- OK, Sally.

07:59.721 --> 08:01.306
You're leaving?

08:01.389 --> 08:02.515
Tonight.

08:02.599 --> 08:05.060
Got a tip-off.
Been here too long.

08:13.985 --> 08:16.154
Crack the dollar
and you can do anything.

08:16.237 --> 08:19.324
It's not quite perfect.
But one of these days...

08:19.407 --> 08:21.576
Have you got the money?

08:22.118 --> 08:25.413
That's what we wanted
to talk to you about.

08:27.082 --> 08:29.501
- They're our people.
- Our people?

08:29.584 --> 08:32.169
I'm me and the others
are the others.

08:34.672 --> 08:37.174
Don't you see
what's going on around you?

08:37.258 --> 08:39.177
What the Nazis are doing to us?

08:39.260 --> 08:41.929
Know why the Jews
are always persecuted?

08:42.013 --> 08:44.682
Because they refuse to adapt!
It's not that hard.

08:44.766 --> 08:48.186
- Sally, don't you have any--
- No.

08:48.269 --> 08:49.854
Need a certificate of Aryan purity?

08:49.938 --> 08:53.024
I'll do one proving you descend
from Siegfried and the Dragon.

08:53.108 --> 08:54.359
Do you know Schiele?

08:55.360 --> 08:57.529
I even met him once,

08:57.612 --> 08:58.780
in Vienna.

08:58.863 --> 09:00.073
A great master.

09:01.116 --> 09:02.700
Your pictures.

09:03.701 --> 09:05.787
I don't believe
you're such an asshole.

09:11.793 --> 09:15.213
Who'd have thought it?
Hans using beautiful women...

09:15.296 --> 09:17.382
Listen--

09:17.465 --> 09:19.801
The jewellery's
not even worth half.

09:21.302 --> 09:23.388
I need an Argentinean passport.

09:25.473 --> 09:28.560
- I've already packed.
- Hans, you can go.

09:30.645 --> 09:32.188
I'll settle this with Mr. Sorowitsch.

09:46.327 --> 09:47.745
You're lucky...

09:49.205 --> 09:51.249
wanting an Argentinean passport.

09:52.917 --> 09:55.044
The home of tango.

10:44.052 --> 10:45.720
You could be a really great artist.

10:47.055 --> 10:48.723
What do you know about it?

10:49.891 --> 10:51.059
A great deal.

10:52.060 --> 10:53.978
Otherwise I wouldn't have stayed.

10:56.397 --> 10:58.316
Why earn money by making art?

10:59.400 --> 11:02.320
Earning money by making money
is far easier.

11:14.123 --> 11:15.542
I have to go.

11:26.803 --> 11:27.971
May I?

11:29.097 --> 11:32.267
Friedrich Herzog, Berlin CID,
Counterfeit Squad.

11:32.850 --> 11:35.353
It is a great honor

11:35.436 --> 11:38.064
to arrest the world's
best counterfeiter,

11:39.107 --> 11:40.775
if that is any consolation.

11:44.279 --> 11:45.446
The dollar!

11:47.782 --> 11:49.617
Bitten off more
than we can chew, eh?

12:22.150 --> 12:23.651
Go on!

12:30.658 --> 12:32.410
Get up, you lazy Jewish bastard!

12:32.493 --> 12:35.079
Get up, will you!

12:38.166 --> 12:40.168
You there!
Get rid of that vermin!

12:44.339 --> 12:46.174
They're out to get us.

12:51.179 --> 12:53.014
This is no jail.

12:54.182 --> 12:55.433
They're going to kill us.

12:56.517 --> 12:58.686
They're out to get us.

13:01.022 --> 13:02.148
The Kapo:

13:02.231 --> 13:03.608
Melzer.

13:04.901 --> 13:06.235
Watch out for him.

13:08.237 --> 13:09.405
A murderer.

13:11.199 --> 13:14.118
The ones with the green triangle...

13:14.202 --> 13:17.163
habitual criminals,
worse than the SS.

13:25.213 --> 13:26.547
But you don't look like a --

13:32.553 --> 13:35.139
If you touch me I'll cut your throat.

13:41.229 --> 13:44.273
I'll be watching you,
you filthy swine.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.442
I'll get you!

13:47.485 --> 13:50.822
Are you crazy?
You can't just --

13:50.905 --> 13:52.323
He has to respect me,

13:52.407 --> 13:54.659
but not lose face.

13:56.077 --> 13:57.662
The same as in any other jail.

15:06.981 --> 15:08.149
On your feet!

15:17.200 --> 15:18.701
Who did this?

15:32.340 --> 15:35.343
Number 75517.

15:46.395 --> 15:47.605
I like it.

15:49.524 --> 15:51.943
You've caught it well, Jew.

15:52.026 --> 15:54.403
- It would be better in color.
- What?

15:54.487 --> 15:58.616
It would be better in color,
Herr Unterscharfuhrer.

15:58.699 --> 16:01.035
The sheen of the boots.

16:02.119 --> 16:04.580
Drawn from memory.

16:26.561 --> 16:27.728
What's all this?

16:30.898 --> 16:33.609
Herr Hauptsturmfuhrer, it's...

16:34.610 --> 16:36.612
It's like this, I...

16:56.257 --> 16:58.301
FIVE YEARS LATER

17:01.596 --> 17:02.763
Sorowitsch!

17:04.098 --> 17:05.223
Look at this.

17:05.308 --> 17:08.185
I thought a Styrian jacket
would look good!

17:08.269 --> 17:11.564
I can paint whatever you want,
Herr Sturmbannfuhrer.

17:11.646 --> 17:14.567
You're being moved.
Sachsenhausen. Tomorrow.

17:16.944 --> 17:18.863
But the picture isn't finished.

17:18.945 --> 17:20.990
I have to finish the picture.

17:21.073 --> 17:23.701
So the maggot's afraid
of losing its bacon!

17:23.784 --> 17:26.871
A dirty little Jew like you
can fix himself up anywhere!

17:59.487 --> 18:01.656
Stinks to high heaven, that Jew!

18:15.211 --> 18:16.379
Food.

18:44.198 --> 18:47.118
I always admired
the Russian avant-garde.

18:47.201 --> 18:48.619
Kandinsky, Rodchenko!

18:48.703 --> 18:51.706
At the academy in Odessa
we had a professor called "Lebed".

18:53.749 --> 18:56.293
In my time,
"Lebed" was a junior lecturer.

18:56.377 --> 18:59.547
You were at the academy?
You're Russian too?

19:00.589 --> 19:04.552
I don't like speaking Russian.
Reminds me of bad times.

19:06.137 --> 19:08.514
You prefer to speak German?

19:13.561 --> 19:15.438
I had a family.

19:18.733 --> 19:20.151
We used to say,

19:20.234 --> 19:24.822
Lebed and good art
is like a virgin and good...

19:24.905 --> 19:26.490
Fucking.

19:26.574 --> 19:28.117
So you know that one too!

19:57.438 --> 19:59.356
Number 75517.

19:59.440 --> 20:01.192
Salomon Sorowitsch.

20:04.111 --> 20:05.529
The King of Counterfeiters!

20:07.114 --> 20:10.701
SS Sturmbannfuhrer Herzog.
Don't you remember? Herzog?

20:10.785 --> 20:12.870
CID Berlin, Counterfeit Squad.

20:14.288 --> 20:16.874
I arrested you!
It got me promoted!

20:20.628 --> 20:22.046
What size are you?

20:23.130 --> 20:24.298
48.

20:25.299 --> 20:27.259
- Shoe size?
- 42.

20:32.139 --> 20:33.849
Welcome to Sachsenhausen!

20:39.313 --> 20:41.857
Name, profession, size?

20:42.942 --> 20:44.401
Burger, printer.

20:44.485 --> 20:45.903
Collotype. 52.

20:45.986 --> 20:48.405
More like 46/48 now.

20:50.032 --> 20:51.033
Shoe size?

20:51.117 --> 20:52.118
41.

20:52.201 --> 20:53.327
No, thanks.

20:54.161 --> 20:56.747
A non-smoker! As you wish.
Much healthier!

20:58.999 --> 21:00.417
Name, profession, size?

21:05.005 --> 21:06.590
Welcome to Sachsenhausen.

21:35.202 --> 21:38.038
We use a different tone
here in my domain

21:38.122 --> 21:40.958
than in the camps
you've just come from.

21:41.041 --> 21:44.086
I'd like to regard you
as coworkers here.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.088
Together we're going to...

21:49.383 --> 21:50.551
Yes.

21:51.719 --> 21:54.346
The clothes are second-hand.

21:55.890 --> 21:58.517
You can wear prison stripes
if you prefer.

21:58.601 --> 22:00.644
After all,
stripes flatter the figure!

22:00.728 --> 22:02.771
What's his name?

22:13.073 --> 22:14.617
What the hell was that for?

22:15.743 --> 22:18.412
A symbolic gesture --
to get us shot?

23:01.121 --> 23:02.289
My dear Jews...

23:03.791 --> 23:07.211
today I bring you a specialist
of international standing,

23:07.294 --> 23:09.380
Salomon Sorowitsch.

23:09.463 --> 23:11.966
He will supervise
the retouching department!

23:15.636 --> 23:17.054
"Operation Bernhard."

23:18.138 --> 23:20.140
Counterfeit money on a huge scale.

23:21.183 --> 23:23.727
ID cards, documents, banknotes...

23:24.770 --> 23:27.481
all to the latest technical standards.

23:29.525 --> 23:32.736
I expect the newcomers will want
to freshen up and relax?

23:32.820 --> 23:35.406
Our foreman here, dear old Atze,

23:35.489 --> 23:36.991
will show you around.

23:37.992 --> 23:40.077
I wish you every success!

23:46.583 --> 23:49.837
Another fine speech by
Herr Sturmbannfuhrer.

24:11.859 --> 24:13.027
Fine beds.

24:16.530 --> 24:18.782
Why are they giving us
such fine beds?

24:21.869 --> 24:23.454
It's still a concentration camp.

24:27.708 --> 24:29.001
But the beds are soft.

24:30.878 --> 24:32.046
That's good.

24:54.735 --> 24:57.821
"Anny Ondra will only wash
with Sarinol."

25:07.414 --> 25:08.999
I was a commercial photographer.

25:26.266 --> 25:27.434
Quiet in here, isn't it?

25:28.602 --> 25:30.270
One forgets what it's like.

25:33.440 --> 25:34.942
Where are they all running to?

25:36.443 --> 25:37.611
The shoe-testing squad.

25:38.695 --> 25:40.614
They make the prisoners
run in a circle...

25:42.116 --> 25:43.534
to test the shoes.

25:43.617 --> 25:45.035
Test them? How?

25:45.119 --> 25:49.206
It's a punishment. The shoes are
too small, sandbags on their backs.

25:49.289 --> 25:50.457
Many of them die.

25:51.792 --> 25:53.377
Best not to even listen.

25:55.629 --> 25:57.214
Music!

25:58.298 --> 26:01.552
Right lads, I'll show you
where you'll be working!

26:05.639 --> 26:08.392
We've got men here from all
different camps. All professional --

26:08.475 --> 26:12.896
graphic artists, printers,
re-touchers, copper engravers.

26:12.980 --> 26:15.065
Why are they using Jews
for the work?

26:15.149 --> 26:17.901
I assume
they mean to kill us after the war.

26:17.985 --> 26:19.236
To keep it under wraps.

26:19.319 --> 26:22.573
A genuine platen press.
Worked with one before?

26:24.992 --> 26:28.078
Lazy bastards!
Faster, you idle riffraff!

26:28.162 --> 26:30.581
It's OK. He's Dr. Klinger,
our Kapo.

26:30.664 --> 26:33.000
The SS need to hear him
yelling at us.

26:42.759 --> 26:43.927
The new arrivals?

26:44.511 --> 26:46.430
Dr. Klinger, internal medicine.

26:48.015 --> 26:49.933
Welcome to the Golden Cage.

26:50.017 --> 26:52.936
Come and see me
at once, young man.

26:53.020 --> 26:54.771
That foot looks bad...

26:54.855 --> 26:56.440
really bad!

27:02.863 --> 27:06.116
I wept too, the first time
I saw a printing press again.

27:06.200 --> 27:07.451
Reminds you
you're a human being.

27:09.369 --> 27:11.455
Zilinski, darkroom.

27:11.538 --> 27:13.790
Matti, show him the ropes.

27:15.375 --> 27:16.543
Karloff?

27:17.628 --> 27:21.632
Graphics section. Through there,
straight ahead. You can't miss it.

27:21.715 --> 27:23.133
Us two beauties...

27:24.134 --> 27:25.719
are going to Quality Control.

27:33.727 --> 27:37.147
Dr. Viktor Hahn, Royal Prussian
Credit Bank, Hamburg.

27:38.190 --> 27:41.568
Mr. Sorowitsch will supervise
the retouching section.

27:41.652 --> 27:44.571
You're also
from the financial sector?

27:47.074 --> 27:49.576
Our main problem is the paper.

27:49.660 --> 27:51.578
It has the wrong feel.

27:52.579 --> 27:56.667
The English paper has the same
structure as a kind of Turkish linen.

27:56.750 --> 27:59.753
We've experimented
with various chemicals,

27:59.836 --> 28:02.005
but the results
remain unsatisfactory.

28:04.508 --> 28:05.676
A green triangle?

28:05.759 --> 28:08.345
A habitual criminal, Herr Laube?

28:08.428 --> 28:10.722
Sorowitsch is -- if one can say so --

28:10.806 --> 28:13.100
a "professional" counterfeiter.

28:13.183 --> 28:15.018
Till now the only criminals here

28:15.102 --> 28:18.230
were those wearing
Nazi uniforms, my good man.

28:19.773 --> 28:24.486
So it besmirches your honor
having to work with a jailbird?

28:25.112 --> 28:27.531
If honor is all one has left!

28:27.614 --> 28:30.534
You'll have a hard time here.
And that's a promise.

28:34.288 --> 28:35.455
Fuck you.

28:46.466 --> 28:47.884
A weekend off!

28:50.637 --> 28:52.222
And a shower on Sunday!

28:52.306 --> 28:54.725
Fraternizing
with a common criminal?

28:54.808 --> 28:57.894
The true criminals
are the capitalist exploiters.

28:57.978 --> 29:00.564
They're the ones
who made Fascism possible.

29:00.647 --> 29:04.067
If a proletarian steals bread
to feed his children...

29:04.151 --> 29:06.528
That's not exactly what I did.

29:06.612 --> 29:09.072
You gave a comrade
your slice of bread.

29:10.157 --> 29:11.408
That was solidarity.

29:11.491 --> 29:13.702
That was soup.

29:14.911 --> 29:16.079
A low number.

29:16.163 --> 29:18.415
How did you survive
so long in Auschwitz?

29:20.000 --> 29:21.168
A good work detail.

29:23.670 --> 29:25.088
What about a game?

29:26.506 --> 29:29.259
- What are we playing for?
- For honor's sake.

29:31.178 --> 29:33.180
I win even when I don't cheat.

29:48.111 --> 29:50.656
What are you doing,
you idle bastard?

29:50.739 --> 29:52.491
This isn't a rest home!

29:52.574 --> 29:54.951
You're here to work!
Understood?

29:55.035 --> 29:56.203
Holst!

29:57.871 --> 29:59.206
Leave him be!

30:00.540 --> 30:04.544
Thinking can also be work, Holst!
Try it yourself sometime.

30:09.216 --> 30:11.301
All amateurs and idiots.

30:11.385 --> 30:14.304
Forget the circumstances
for a moment.

30:15.389 --> 30:18.308
It's just you and me.
The most perfect forgeries ever.

30:18.392 --> 30:20.394
First the pound...

30:21.395 --> 30:23.563
and then the dollar!

30:25.399 --> 30:27.651
Men, machines, material --
whatever you need!

30:29.403 --> 30:31.154
You see, Sorowitsch...

30:32.406 --> 30:35.158
there are ways of surviving here.

30:35.242 --> 30:37.744
I can't guarantee it
for the others, but for you...

30:40.080 --> 30:41.248
if...

31:02.602 --> 31:05.689
Gentlemen, can't you stop that
nigger music?

31:05.772 --> 31:08.024
As if there
weren't any German music!

31:09.025 --> 31:10.360
One more before bedtime.

31:10.444 --> 31:13.029
Why isn't God in Auschwitz?

31:13.113 --> 31:15.282
He didn't get through
the selection process!

31:20.287 --> 31:21.455
Kanada.

31:24.791 --> 31:25.959
The low number.

31:27.127 --> 31:29.629
I was in the Canada work detail.

31:30.630 --> 31:32.883
We sorted the luggage
on the platform.

31:32.966 --> 31:35.135
We took the food in the bags

31:35.218 --> 31:38.221
while the people it belonged to
were being gassed.

31:40.807 --> 31:42.768
One adapts or dies.

31:46.813 --> 31:48.064
I can't go on like this.

31:51.485 --> 31:52.903
We have it so good in here...

31:54.821 --> 31:56.198
while out there...

31:58.825 --> 32:00.410
My wife is still in Auschwitz.

32:02.996 --> 32:06.833
I won't give the Nazis the pleasure
of being ashamed I'm still alive.

32:14.174 --> 32:18.261
All prisoners to remain
in their barracks!

32:22.015 --> 32:25.393
Allegedly not even the commandant
knows what we do in here!

32:25.477 --> 32:26.686
...will be shot immediately!

32:39.115 --> 32:42.202
...anything, as long as
we aren't put out here again.

32:43.203 --> 32:44.204
Anything...

33:05.725 --> 33:07.227
What's the matter?

33:08.228 --> 33:09.646
They're going to gas us!

33:09.729 --> 33:12.315
We're too valuable,
they won't harm us.

33:12.399 --> 33:14.192
Come on, get undressed.

33:14.276 --> 33:15.443
Come on!

33:18.905 --> 33:20.073
Burger!

33:21.575 --> 33:23.243
Can you hear me?
Are you hurt?

33:24.244 --> 33:25.745
Get up.

33:26.246 --> 33:27.914
- Leave him, Burger! Come here!
- Dr. Klinger!

33:32.460 --> 33:33.628
You there!

33:35.255 --> 33:36.673
What are you doing here?

33:38.925 --> 33:40.427
Did any of them speak to you?

33:40.927 --> 33:42.679
Did anybody speak to you?

33:42.762 --> 33:44.180
Number 64000.

33:44.264 --> 33:46.850
- I asked if anybody here spoke to you.
- He was lying on the...

33:46.933 --> 33:49.019
Shut your face.
Did he speak to you?

33:49.102 --> 33:51.521
- I don't know him.
- What did he say?

33:51.605 --> 33:54.024
God, are you dumb!
You come with me.

33:57.777 --> 33:59.529
What did you say to him?

33:59.613 --> 34:03.533
It's forbidden to speak
to other prisoners.

34:08.455 --> 34:12.876
Mr. Burger
is our only collotype expert.

34:12.958 --> 34:14.878
He didn't speak to him either.

34:17.964 --> 34:19.132
Go and shower.

34:23.469 --> 34:24.638
Go and shower!

34:31.978 --> 34:33.228
I just wanted to help him.

34:44.783 --> 34:47.452
Move!

34:49.996 --> 34:53.917
They're going to gas us.
Gas... I can smell it.

34:54.501 --> 34:57.337
Water! It's water!

35:33.623 --> 35:34.791
Odessa?

35:36.042 --> 35:37.335
For you!

35:38.378 --> 35:41.006
Please excuse,
about today in shower.

35:41.089 --> 35:43.299
Reminds me a bit of Lukanov.

35:45.218 --> 35:46.302
Yes.

35:46.386 --> 35:48.221
Do you know his city views?

35:49.222 --> 35:51.975
Colors!
A pity there are no colors here.

35:52.058 --> 35:54.644
For me Odessa is blue, dark blue!

35:58.064 --> 36:00.316
In the academy they said
my style is bad.

36:00.400 --> 36:03.403
But it's my art.
Even if it only pleases me.

36:28.344 --> 36:29.512
Let me have a look.

36:32.265 --> 36:33.433
I can do better than that.

36:34.768 --> 36:35.935
Let me try again.

36:40.815 --> 36:41.983
Number 93 --

36:43.735 --> 36:45.862
Have you settled in yet?

36:45.945 --> 36:47.363
Got everything you need?

36:47.447 --> 36:50.700
The ID cards we're supposed
to produce --

36:50.784 --> 36:52.869
the problem's
the cover and the paper.

36:52.952 --> 36:56.164
If we could have used originals...

36:56.748 --> 36:59.459
You must now devote
all your efforts to the pound!

37:00.543 --> 37:03.046
It's important
we get results soon.

37:03.129 --> 37:04.964
Himmler is growing impatient.

37:08.259 --> 37:09.427
What's this?

37:10.637 --> 37:12.138
My 5-year-old could do better!

37:16.476 --> 37:18.728
I'm a rail track layer.

37:18.812 --> 37:21.898
I said I was a printer
to get out of Sobibor.

37:21.981 --> 37:24.734
They couldn't translate
my ID card. Help me!

37:27.654 --> 37:31.241
Paracystosis,
a material defect in the copper.

37:31.324 --> 37:33.910
Loszek is a specialist
in relief printing.

37:33.993 --> 37:37.080
He could be transferred
to the ID card section.

37:38.164 --> 37:39.833
Paracystosis.

37:42.794 --> 37:46.756
Or we could have him shot.

37:50.593 --> 37:51.302
Beat it!

37:58.893 --> 38:02.188
Never try to deceive me again,
Sorowitsch.

38:03.189 --> 38:04.691
We're on the same side now.

39:02.749 --> 39:04.751
Is this some
of the Turkish linen?

39:05.752 --> 39:08.129
Yes. I thought --

39:09.380 --> 39:10.548
Throw that away.

39:12.425 --> 39:14.010
Rags!

39:14.093 --> 39:16.179
The English use rags!

39:16.262 --> 39:18.765
Fibers, torn and abraded
thousands of times!

39:55.468 --> 39:58.721
Hardly any of the English
use wallets.

39:58.805 --> 40:02.392
They pin the notes together
with safety pins.

40:02.475 --> 40:06.396
That's why we're making
the little holes here at the edges.

40:10.483 --> 40:11.859
Negative retouching.

40:43.850 --> 40:48.938
It's not just a matter of slipping
a few notes past a shop assistant.

40:50.857 --> 40:53.943
We intend to flood and destroy
Britain's economy.

40:56.529 --> 40:59.449
If they realize we're using
forged notes...

41:01.034 --> 41:02.785
that'll be the end of the operation.

41:03.703 --> 41:05.371
We'd have to send you back...

41:06.706 --> 41:08.416
to the camps.

41:25.516 --> 41:27.643
She wasn't wearing any knickers!

41:27.727 --> 41:31.606
Just imagine, a photo shoot with
an agent, producer, and everything,

41:31.689 --> 41:35.318
and that hot little tart
with no knickers! Skirt like this.

41:35.401 --> 41:37.987
"Doesn't the gentleman
want to take another shot?"

41:39.072 --> 41:41.991
"Sure. I won't even need a tripod."

41:43.951 --> 41:45.328
You're standing in the sun.

41:53.086 --> 41:54.837
If we fail to bring off the pound...

41:56.089 --> 41:57.673
we should organize ourselves!

41:59.592 --> 42:00.843
There's a lot of us.

42:01.427 --> 42:04.430
We're well nourished,
we're strong, we could fight!

42:05.431 --> 42:06.682
We've got tools.

42:06.766 --> 42:08.351
With retouching knives?

42:09.769 --> 42:11.354
Against an SS company?

42:12.605 --> 42:14.273
Rather than let them gas us!

42:17.610 --> 42:20.822
I'd rather be gassed tomorrow
than shot for nothing today.

42:20.905 --> 42:22.240
A day is a day.

42:24.075 --> 42:27.078
A revolt would at least be a sign!

42:31.457 --> 42:32.625
Zilinski's right.

42:34.293 --> 42:35.545
You're standing in the sun.

42:45.638 --> 42:47.390
Kolya?

42:47.473 --> 42:49.058
When did the fever start?

42:50.810 --> 42:52.895
Sometimes fever is bad.

42:52.979 --> 42:54.564
In between, it's OK.

42:56.441 --> 43:00.403
We've had TB cases here before.
I asked for drugs, and...

43:00.486 --> 43:02.238
Kleinfeld, Stiasny, Jilovsky.

43:02.321 --> 43:05.032
All shot, because of
the risk of infection.

43:05.116 --> 43:06.534
Can you help him?

43:06.617 --> 43:08.161
I'll see what I...

43:09.162 --> 43:10.663
Without the right drugs...

43:12.665 --> 43:13.833
Isolate him.

43:17.336 --> 43:18.921
I'm a doctor--

43:19.005 --> 43:20.173
internal medicine!

43:24.886 --> 43:26.053
Bad sickness?

43:26.137 --> 43:27.597
No, no.

43:28.681 --> 43:30.266
The doctor will make it better.

43:32.310 --> 43:35.438
I have to live to see
when the camp is over.

43:38.357 --> 43:39.525
Exactly!

43:59.378 --> 44:00.630
Bring some dressings, fast!

44:06.886 --> 44:09.805
Those original documents
you asked for.

44:09.889 --> 44:11.807
The crates came from Auschwitz.

44:11.891 --> 44:14.310
Loszek found
his children's passports.

44:19.899 --> 44:21.567
This is pointless!

44:24.320 --> 44:25.446
You have to survive.

44:27.448 --> 44:29.825
Only by surviving
can we defeat them!

44:30.910 --> 44:32.828
You have to survive!

44:32.912 --> 44:34.413
Loszek, you must survive!

44:43.548 --> 44:45.132
Wake up!

44:45.216 --> 44:46.676
Assemble for roll call outside!

44:46.759 --> 44:48.427
Filthy Jewish scum!

44:51.222 --> 44:52.473
Outside!

44:59.355 --> 45:00.982
Get out!

45:15.955 --> 45:19.709
Sorry to wake you,
but I have a story to tell.

45:20.793 --> 45:24.005
A few days ago, a businessman
went into a bank in Zurich.

45:25.006 --> 45:27.008
He was carrying a small case...

45:27.592 --> 45:28.759
full of money.

45:30.803 --> 45:32.221
Pound notes.

45:37.810 --> 45:42.565
Our agent asks to open an account
with his British pounds.

45:42.648 --> 45:43.941
Of course, Monsieur.

45:44.942 --> 45:47.862
But you must understand,
for reasons of security,

45:47.945 --> 45:50.906
we have to check
the authenticity of these notes.

45:50.990 --> 45:52.199
But of course!

45:53.200 --> 45:54.910
In times like these...

45:58.289 --> 46:00.416
For half an hour,

46:00.499 --> 46:03.711
Swiss bank experts scrutinized
our little printed products,

46:03.794 --> 46:05.588
with a vengeance.

46:14.388 --> 46:16.390
Your bank notes.

46:16.474 --> 46:19.435
Our examination has confirmed

46:19.518 --> 46:22.229
that as far as we can tell...

46:22.813 --> 46:25.441
they are...

46:26.025 --> 46:28.361
genuine!

46:32.615 --> 46:34.116
Wait, it's not over yet.

46:34.200 --> 46:36.285
Our agent gets cocky!

46:36.369 --> 46:37.703
Monsieur le Directeur...

46:38.704 --> 46:40.456
since I received these notes

46:40.539 --> 46:44.627
from an admittedly
rather dubious source...

46:45.711 --> 46:48.464
I'd prefer to have
absolute certainty.

46:48.547 --> 46:51.175
Our bank
will accept your money.

46:51.258 --> 46:54.136
- There is no need--
- Absolute certainty, Monsieur.

46:55.221 --> 46:57.139
If you insist,

46:57.223 --> 47:01.143
then I suggest we have the notes
checked by the Bank of England.

47:01.227 --> 47:03.312
The Bank of England!

47:03.396 --> 47:05.815
Let's see what they have
to carp about.

47:05.898 --> 47:07.566
Maybe we'll get a few tips.

47:12.071 --> 47:14.323
"After thorough examination,
we conclude

47:14.407 --> 47:17.493
"that the bank notes
submitted by you

47:17.576 --> 47:19.245
"in denominations of 5,

47:19.328 --> 47:22.456
"10, and 20 sterling...

47:23.541 --> 47:26.293
"are not forgeries.

47:27.378 --> 47:31.173
The Bank of England herewith
guarantees their authenticity."

47:37.930 --> 47:41.016
Reichsfuhrer SS Himmler
is very pleased with our efforts.

47:42.101 --> 47:45.020
These duds are so perfect
our plans have changed.

47:45.104 --> 47:47.356
They're too good to be
simply dropped over England.

47:47.440 --> 47:52.695
The German Reich will use them
for its long-term currency dealings!

47:53.529 --> 47:56.949
And in turn
this gave me the idea...

47:57.950 --> 48:00.035
of giving you a little pleasure.

48:01.620 --> 48:03.414
As an incentive, so to speak.

48:15.968 --> 48:17.219
I thought perhaps...

48:18.971 --> 48:20.556
after work, or...

48:21.807 --> 48:23.267
at the weekend?

48:26.312 --> 48:30.733
On behalf of all the men, I'd like
to thank you for all our privileges.

48:30.816 --> 48:33.068
Motivation, Klinger, motivation!

48:34.153 --> 48:37.740
I'm interested in managing people;
that's where the future lies.

48:39.158 --> 48:41.327
If you treat people like dirt,
they won't work.

48:41.410 --> 48:43.829
And if you treat dirt like people...

48:47.500 --> 48:50.920
You Jews -- tricks and fakery,
that's what you're good at.

48:51.003 --> 48:54.632
If one scratches just a bit
at that respectable facade...

48:55.508 --> 48:57.009
Herr Sturmbannfuhrer.

48:58.511 --> 49:00.930
All my life I've been
an upright citizen.

49:01.013 --> 49:02.431
I must point out that

49:02.515 --> 49:05.935
here I am being coerced
into performing dishonest acts.

49:19.615 --> 49:21.116
Excellent work, Sorowitsch.

49:21.200 --> 49:23.953
Set up a new working group
for the dollar!

49:52.898 --> 49:54.483
Can't anyone see
what's happening?

49:55.568 --> 49:56.986
The Germans are bankrupt.

49:58.070 --> 50:00.656
No foreign currency means
no gasoline, no raw materials.

50:00.739 --> 50:03.909
- We're financing the Nazi war effort!
- So?

50:04.910 --> 50:07.746
Are you suggesting sabotage?
In a concentration camp?

50:51.624 --> 50:55.044
The Americans use rotogravure,
we're using collotype...

50:55.127 --> 50:57.963
in order to produce
large amounts quickly.

50:59.048 --> 51:01.300
Collotype is good for definition
and halftones.

51:02.301 --> 51:06.889
There are still some problems,
but we're dealing with them.

51:06.972 --> 51:10.559
Thankfully we have
an expert in this field.

51:13.938 --> 51:15.856
A score to settle with the dollar?

51:15.940 --> 51:18.400
You know it was the dollars
that led to your arrest.

51:18.484 --> 51:20.819
Back then, I didn't have
the technical means.

51:22.154 --> 51:23.322
And now?

51:24.156 --> 51:25.658
How much do you need?

51:28.160 --> 51:29.411
Maybe a few hundred million.

51:36.502 --> 51:38.170
You cheap whore!

51:39.213 --> 51:42.424
Just be thankful you're in here,
you idiot!

51:49.348 --> 51:51.850
Shit, shit, shit!

52:08.867 --> 52:11.954
Maybe it's not the negative
but your gelatin.

52:18.043 --> 52:20.295
Sorowitsch's negative
was perfect, as always.

52:24.383 --> 52:25.551
But why...?

52:31.390 --> 52:35.811
My wife and I were sent to Auschwitz
for printing anti-Nazi flyers.

52:37.896 --> 52:40.315
I'm not going to print money
for the Nazis.

52:48.240 --> 52:49.408
Look...

52:50.242 --> 52:52.161
my family, small business...

52:52.244 --> 52:57.166
always careful, never any
problems with the authorities.

52:57.249 --> 53:00.335
Kept my nose out of politics.

53:00.419 --> 53:02.421
Gisela, my wife, always said...

53:03.505 --> 53:06.425
the reason we're printers
is to print the truth!

53:07.426 --> 53:09.428
Where did you learn that slogan?

53:09.970 --> 53:13.432
The Communist Printers' League,
youth section?

53:17.436 --> 53:20.856
If we print millions of dollars,
it could decide the war.

53:20.939 --> 53:23.108
We could contribute to fighting
the Nazis here...

53:24.109 --> 53:26.653
that wouldn't be
just a symbolic gesture!

53:26.737 --> 53:28.530
We're alive.

53:28.614 --> 53:30.949
- That's worth a hell of a lot.
- Exactly.

53:31.033 --> 53:33.535
Isn't it about more
than your own shitty little life?

53:33.619 --> 53:36.330
Our shitty life
is the only thing we have.

53:36.413 --> 53:40.918
Is this about surviving, or proving
that you can forge the dollar?

53:46.882 --> 53:48.884
I'll keep on
destroying your negatives.

53:50.469 --> 53:52.387
You can squeal to Herzog
if you want.

53:55.641 --> 53:58.852
We'll have to pay for it
if we don't deliver!

53:58.936 --> 54:02.314
All of us will pay!

54:04.650 --> 54:05.818
Yes.

54:29.842 --> 54:31.260
Warsaw!

54:31.343 --> 54:33.137
The bastards
are being driven back!

54:49.486 --> 54:50.654
Carry on!

54:54.533 --> 54:57.369
So you're failing with the dollar?

54:58.453 --> 55:01.123
We're still having problems
with the gelatin,

55:01.206 --> 55:02.791
Herr Hauptscharfuhrer.

55:03.208 --> 55:05.127
We can do the pound
without you now.

55:06.211 --> 55:08.714
And you know what you are
without the dollar?

55:08.797 --> 55:11.466
Nothing but criminal
Jewish scum.

55:13.552 --> 55:16.972
Fuck Herzog and his "motivation."

55:19.892 --> 55:22.477
I'd soon make you knuckle under.

55:38.577 --> 55:40.162
You're such filthy swine.

55:41.246 --> 55:43.415
Stoop to anything
to save your wretched lives.

55:45.584 --> 55:46.919
Nauseating.

56:30.128 --> 56:31.296
Plappler.

56:31.964 --> 56:35.467
Get Hotte. A basin's broken --
maybe he can repair it.

56:53.652 --> 56:58.156
I saved all our butts
by forging the pound for the Nazis.

57:11.169 --> 57:14.089
Dr. Klinger said you must eat well.

57:14.172 --> 57:15.340
What for?

57:19.011 --> 57:21.430
One for the Expressionists.

57:21.513 --> 57:24.266
One for the Avant-garde.

57:24.349 --> 57:26.101
Eat, or I'll flatten you.

57:31.023 --> 57:33.108
You certainly know
how to bring up children.

57:40.866 --> 57:42.451
What happened to your family?

57:47.372 --> 57:49.791
Deported, killed?

57:53.211 --> 57:56.131
I could've bought their release,
if I'd had money.

58:14.066 --> 58:17.069
14 to 6. Burger to serve.

58:27.704 --> 58:28.872
Get up!

58:30.999 --> 58:32.376
Keep running!

58:38.090 --> 58:39.591
What's going on?

58:39.674 --> 58:41.885
Herr Rottenfuhrer,
I was about to --

58:41.968 --> 58:43.762
What are you waiting for?

58:44.763 --> 58:48.266
No, please not...!

58:58.110 --> 59:01.279
Are you crazy, soldier?

59:01.363 --> 59:03.365
Stand at attention!

59:03.448 --> 59:04.741
Your name, cretin?

59:04.825 --> 59:06.701
Rottenfuhrer Wegener,
Herr Hauptscharfuhrer.

59:08.453 --> 59:10.205
Why are you shooting here?

59:10.288 --> 59:13.959
What if you'd hit one of my Jews?

59:17.295 --> 59:18.463
Play!

59:19.965 --> 59:21.341
15 to 6.

59:25.804 --> 59:28.890
It's a concentration camp.
Dozens are murdered here every day.

59:28.974 --> 59:30.475
Let's just stop up our ears!

59:33.145 --> 59:34.312
16 to 6.

59:40.986 --> 59:42.320
One of thousands.

59:43.488 --> 59:46.408
Just be thankful we're
on this side of the wall, Sally.

59:55.167 --> 59:58.211
Look at that!

01:00:13.727 --> 01:00:16.563
If you don't survive here
why survive at all?

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:47.052
Atze has just told me why we still have
no results after so many months.

01:00:47.594 --> 01:00:50.805
The gelatin, Herr Sturmbannfuhrer.
It melts.

01:00:50.889 --> 01:00:52.057
Oh, yes!

01:00:54.226 --> 01:00:56.728
I've already heard that lie
from the other Jew there.

01:01:06.571 --> 01:01:08.323
Are you trying to sabotage?

01:01:13.745 --> 01:01:15.455
- We're doing everything--
- Hold your tongue!

01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:17.707
Don't think you're irreplaceable!

01:01:24.089 --> 01:01:25.257
Right.

01:01:26.424 --> 01:01:28.176
Berlin is demanding the dollar.

01:01:29.427 --> 01:01:30.554
Those five there.

01:01:30.637 --> 01:01:32.138
Klinger, take down their names!

01:01:32.222 --> 01:01:34.182
If there's no dollar in four weeks,

01:01:34.266 --> 01:01:37.185
those five will be shot
and five others selected.

01:01:37.269 --> 01:01:39.187
Not Sorowitsch, that one.

01:01:40.605 --> 01:01:43.358
Don't believe
I can't dispense with you.

01:01:46.278 --> 01:01:47.445
By the way, Klinger.

01:01:51.116 --> 01:01:53.868
It's Carnival time!
What about having an evening's fun,

01:01:53.952 --> 01:01:57.372
with music, dancing,
cabaret, a knees-up!

01:01:57.455 --> 01:01:59.791
I'm sure a few talented men
can be found!

01:02:01.626 --> 01:02:03.044
Herr Sturmbannfuhrer!

01:02:03.128 --> 01:02:06.298
I've always done my best.

01:02:16.641 --> 01:02:20.395
He won't kill anyone. He's got to deliver,
so he's blackmailing us.

01:02:20.478 --> 01:02:23.857
- What would you do in his position?
- Me in his position?

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:26.234
I'd never be in the position
of an SS criminal.

01:02:49.507 --> 01:02:50.675
It's Burger.

01:02:51.843 --> 01:02:53.762
I suspect he's deliberately...

01:02:55.513 --> 01:02:57.098
Yesterday I saw him...

01:02:57.182 --> 01:02:59.768
- He's sabotaging them. I know.
- What?

01:03:01.519 --> 01:03:03.563
But if he doesn't stop...

01:03:09.694 --> 01:03:11.279
Herzog saved our lives.

01:03:11.363 --> 01:03:12.781
He plays fair.

01:03:12.864 --> 01:03:17.118
- One can talk to him.
- You'll hold your tongue, Zilinski.

01:03:17.202 --> 01:03:20.121
- One doesn't betray one's mates.
- Mates?

01:03:20.205 --> 01:03:23.458
We're to die for the ideals
of that shitty political ideologue?

01:03:26.544 --> 01:03:28.129
Sit down.

01:03:29.714 --> 01:03:31.216
Burger the hero!

01:03:33.051 --> 01:03:36.012
He's always determined
to play the martyr.

01:03:36.096 --> 01:03:38.014
That's fine for him,
but not with me!

01:03:41.393 --> 01:03:44.145
I lost four toes to frostbite
in Buchenwald.

01:03:44.229 --> 01:03:46.314
They broke my back in Dachau.

01:03:46.398 --> 01:03:49.150
More than once
I nearly died of starvation.

01:03:49.234 --> 01:03:52.278
I deserve to survive this too!

01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:54.906
One never squeals on one's mates.

01:03:56.241 --> 01:03:57.409
Never!

01:03:57.992 --> 01:03:59.494
What's this?

01:04:00.578 --> 01:04:02.080
Jailbirds' honor?

01:04:10.088 --> 01:04:12.424
If you betray him, I'll kill you.

01:04:28.273 --> 01:04:31.025
We've delayed the dollar by months.

01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:33.027
You've had your fun.

01:04:33.111 --> 01:04:36.030
But now our mates' lives
are at stake.

01:04:36.114 --> 01:04:37.365
You can't just...

01:04:41.411 --> 01:04:42.412
Gisela...

01:04:44.205 --> 01:04:45.373
my wife.

01:04:49.627 --> 01:04:51.171
She was in Auschwitz too.

01:04:53.631 --> 01:04:54.966
Shot trying to escape.

01:04:55.967 --> 01:04:57.552
I'm...

01:04:58.970 --> 01:05:00.138
You're sorry?

01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:06.478
Thanks.

01:05:17.155 --> 01:05:18.239
But now it's the dollar!

01:05:21.493 --> 01:05:22.660
We have to go on.

01:05:24.996 --> 01:05:26.164
It's a matter of...

01:05:26.831 --> 01:05:28.750
our comfortable life here.

01:05:28.833 --> 01:05:31.044
Of these fine beds.
These fine...

01:05:31.127 --> 01:05:32.837
soft beds!

01:05:52.857 --> 01:05:54.651
I thought I'd be able to cry.

01:06:10.375 --> 01:06:11.709
Serious but stable.

01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:14.462
A race against time.

01:06:14.546 --> 01:06:16.297
But without medication...

01:06:16.381 --> 01:06:17.799
What do you need?

01:06:19.884 --> 01:06:22.470
- But how...?
- The drugs!

01:06:24.889 --> 01:06:26.391
In Theresienstadt...

01:06:27.392 --> 01:06:28.977
there were never enough drugs.

01:06:30.061 --> 01:06:33.481
I had to decide...

01:06:34.566 --> 01:06:35.900
who was healed...

01:06:37.569 --> 01:06:39.153
and who died.

01:06:45.577 --> 01:06:48.538
Herzog's a crook.
I know how to handle him.

01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:01.426
Need an invitation, or what?

01:07:24.782 --> 01:07:26.784
How nice that you could come!

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:31.372
For goodness' sake
take the handcuffs off him.

01:07:32.957 --> 01:07:34.125
Chilly, isn't it?

01:07:40.548 --> 01:07:44.969
How I wish certain East Coast circles
in America could see you!

01:07:45.053 --> 01:07:47.513
You've no idea
of the dreadful propaganda

01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:49.390
being circulated about the camps!

01:07:50.141 --> 01:07:52.518
Friedrich, do pour Herr Soritsch
another cup of tea!

01:07:53.603 --> 01:07:56.898
Do you take candy sugar --
as a Jew?

01:07:56.981 --> 01:07:59.901
Friedrich told me you were
a dangerous criminal...

01:07:59.984 --> 01:08:01.110
and now?

01:08:01.194 --> 01:08:03.237
Serving a noble cause!

01:08:03.321 --> 01:08:05.657
I don't understand anything
about politics, but...!

01:08:06.157 --> 01:08:07.617
Now, children...

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:10.620
we must leave Daddy
and his visitor alone.

01:08:17.502 --> 01:08:19.170
Leni, Lotte...

01:08:20.212 --> 01:08:21.255
and little Friedrich.

01:08:23.174 --> 01:08:24.425
Bringing up children...

01:08:27.011 --> 01:08:29.596
making responsible individuals
of them,

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:31.099
who take charge of their lives.

01:08:32.183 --> 01:08:34.435
I don't hit my children.

01:08:34.519 --> 01:08:35.937
Ever.

01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:37.438
Words are enough...

01:08:38.856 --> 01:08:40.774
and setting
a good example oneself.

01:08:42.026 --> 01:08:43.611
That's what counts, Sorowitsch.

01:08:49.701 --> 01:08:51.786
After all, who knows
what the future will bring?

01:08:55.707 --> 01:08:56.957
If the Russians come...

01:08:58.542 --> 01:09:02.130
one will just have to fight anew
for one's place in society.

01:09:03.756 --> 01:09:04.924
Do you know...

01:09:05.383 --> 01:09:09.178
I used to be--a long,
long time ago--a Communist.

01:09:11.389 --> 01:09:14.142
Liberty, equality, human rights--

01:09:14.225 --> 01:09:15.643
the whole caboodle!

01:09:15.727 --> 01:09:18.062
And don't get the idea
that I'm a Nazi!

01:09:18.145 --> 01:09:19.647
No, no.

01:09:20.648 --> 01:09:22.567
No more grand ideals.

01:09:23.568 --> 01:09:25.819
I do my work where I'm needed.

01:09:25.903 --> 01:09:26.988
Do you understand?

01:09:27.988 --> 01:09:29.991
Everyone has to look out
for himself.

01:09:33.243 --> 01:09:34.662
You must produce the dollar!

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:37.957
Any longer and I can't--

01:09:39.250 --> 01:09:43.379
I know about the sabotage.
I know you won't betray your friends.

01:09:43.462 --> 01:09:44.796
But I must deliver the goods.

01:09:45.798 --> 01:09:47.258
Whatever the price.

01:10:08.112 --> 01:10:09.447
Who's it for?

01:10:12.450 --> 01:10:13.910
And then I get the dollar?

01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:17.413
You Jews!

01:10:17.497 --> 01:10:20.333
You'd even bargain
with a comrade's life!

01:10:26.964 --> 01:10:29.550
By the way, that Burger--

01:10:29.634 --> 01:10:31.385
Absolutely trustworthy.

01:10:31.469 --> 01:10:33.262
Collotype.
Our most important man.

01:10:47.819 --> 01:10:49.570
Only six days left.
Will you do the dollar?

01:10:52.698 --> 01:10:56.077
Leibowitz is a rotogravure printer.
Show him how, so you don't have to--

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.328
No, Zilinski.

01:10:57.411 --> 01:10:59.330
We have a responsibility

01:10:59.413 --> 01:11:01.916
towards our families
and our comrades...

01:11:01.999 --> 01:11:06.420
- because we've got it so good.
- I can't listen to this crap any longer!

01:11:09.173 --> 01:11:11.884
So you decide
that we get ourselves shot?

01:11:11.968 --> 01:11:13.261
It's the principle.

01:11:13.344 --> 01:11:16.097
Nobody's prepared
to die for a principle.

01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:18.307
That's why the Nazis'
system works!

01:11:23.396 --> 01:11:26.983
You will do the fucking dollar!

01:13:05.122 --> 01:13:06.290
Well...

01:13:07.291 --> 01:13:10.878
let's see what progress
has been made.

01:13:17.802 --> 01:13:19.053
Herr Sturmbannfuhrer...

01:13:20.638 --> 01:13:23.057
we're still having problems
with the gelatin.

01:13:24.475 --> 01:13:27.770
Herr Sturmbannfuhrer,
no, it's like this.

01:13:27.853 --> 01:13:29.021
Burger...

01:13:38.322 --> 01:13:40.741
See if you can tell
which are the genuine ones.

01:13:54.171 --> 01:13:55.673
The dollar!

01:13:56.674 --> 01:13:57.842
That is brilliant!

01:13:58.592 --> 01:14:00.011
Your masterpiece!

01:14:02.346 --> 01:14:07.018
Using collotype we could produce
a million a week?

01:14:09.979 --> 01:14:12.440
Now that is a nice surprise
for Carnival!

01:14:30.374 --> 01:14:32.877
I knew you could be relied upon!

01:14:45.306 --> 01:14:47.141
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:14:47.224 --> 01:14:54.023
let me give you a very warm welcome
to our 1945 Carnival Show.

01:14:54.565 --> 01:14:57.777
From the world's
most expensive stage!

01:15:35.272 --> 01:15:37.858
Try not to cough
when Herzog's around.

01:16:09.306 --> 01:16:11.600
You always wanted colors!

01:16:42.423 --> 01:16:43.799
Listen...

01:16:47.678 --> 01:16:50.514
here's another one...

01:16:51.599 --> 01:16:56.145
you've not heard this one yet.

01:16:56.228 --> 01:16:59.190
A nun goes to the gynecologist
with a hamster...

01:16:59.732 --> 01:17:02.651
Wait, I haven't finished yet!

01:17:04.153 --> 01:17:07.364
That you all owe your lives to me,
for getting you out of...

01:17:08.365 --> 01:17:10.534
- Auschwitz, Mauthausen...
- The drugs?

01:17:15.372 --> 01:17:17.791
Name, place of birth, in capitals.

01:17:17.875 --> 01:17:20.711
SWISS PASSPORT

01:17:24.882 --> 01:17:27.092
Put "Jew" as well,
to be on the safe side.

01:17:29.553 --> 01:17:32.223
You should take care
you don't get infected.

01:17:33.724 --> 01:17:38.020
Ultimately, your survival
is what it's all about!

01:17:45.236 --> 01:17:46.737
These are difficult times.

01:17:48.239 --> 01:17:49.907
It's no longer easy for me either.

01:18:08.259 --> 01:18:09.343
Wonderful!

01:18:11.262 --> 01:18:12.680
This will give us a chance.

01:18:13.931 --> 01:18:15.266
Where's Kolya?

01:18:50.718 --> 01:18:52.261
How old are you?

01:18:54.138 --> 01:18:55.306
Twenty.

01:18:56.307 --> 01:18:57.641
And where are you from?

01:18:58.642 --> 01:18:59.810
Odessa.

01:19:01.186 --> 01:19:03.230
The Black Sea, how lovely.

01:19:04.315 --> 01:19:05.482
Kneel down.

01:19:41.852 --> 01:19:43.604
Karloff had TB,

01:19:43.687 --> 01:19:46.774
a very dangerous,
infectious disease.

01:19:46.857 --> 01:19:49.943
He was endangering
the health of you all,

01:19:50.027 --> 01:19:52.112
so I had to shoot him.

01:19:52.696 --> 01:19:55.366
For your own good, lads!

01:19:56.367 --> 01:19:58.535
We smoked a cigarette together.

01:19:59.703 --> 01:20:02.122
He knew
what was going to happen.

01:20:02.206 --> 01:20:05.626
I tell you,
he was really brave.

01:20:05.709 --> 01:20:06.835
A Jew...

01:20:06.919 --> 01:20:09.213
but he died like a man!

01:20:11.215 --> 01:20:13.634
But now, let's forget about it!

01:20:13.717 --> 01:20:16.637
Sturmbannfuhrer Herzog
has had to leave,

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:19.807
but he left me these to give you.

01:20:19.890 --> 01:20:22.226
So let's thank him for that
with three cheers!

01:20:29.066 --> 01:20:30.234
Carry on as you were!

01:21:53.358 --> 01:21:55.068
Stop work!

01:21:55.152 --> 01:21:58.197
Stop work immediately!
Dismantle the machines!

01:22:00.783 --> 01:22:03.410
The Exakt platen press,
the rotopress,

01:22:03.494 --> 01:22:06.246
and the Boston press
must be loaded first.

01:22:06.330 --> 01:22:07.831
We must find out--

01:22:08.332 --> 01:22:10.584
Didn't I express myself
clearly enough?

01:22:10.667 --> 01:22:13.086
I said dismantle the machines!

01:22:13.170 --> 01:22:16.423
You've got exactly six days
to dismantle and pack everything!

01:22:16.507 --> 01:22:20.302
Anything not working afterwards
counts as sabotage!

01:22:20.385 --> 01:22:22.763
What's wrong with you?
Get them moving!

01:22:22.846 --> 01:22:24.932
Standing there
like stuffed dummies.

01:22:25.015 --> 01:22:27.601
The Exakt platen press,

01:22:27.684 --> 01:22:31.438
the rotopress, and the Boston press
must be loaded first.

01:22:31.522 --> 01:22:35.108
Herr Hauptscharfuhrer,
where are we being moved?

01:22:35.192 --> 01:22:38.529
How dare you?
Think we're a travel agency?

01:22:39.571 --> 01:22:40.864
Are you stupid, or what?

01:22:41.949 --> 01:22:43.075
A stupid fucking Jew!

01:22:48.205 --> 01:22:50.374
Hurry up!

01:23:01.718 --> 01:23:03.303
Those aren't aircraft bombs.

01:23:06.223 --> 01:23:08.058
They're not aircraft bombs,
it's artillery!

01:23:09.059 --> 01:23:10.561
The Allies are outside Berlin!

01:23:17.067 --> 01:23:19.069
If the war's ending, they'll kill us.

01:23:39.006 --> 01:23:40.173
Lads!

01:23:41.592 --> 01:23:44.720
The machines will be
taken to a safe hiding place.

01:23:44.803 --> 01:23:46.096
Secret caves in the Alps.

01:23:47.764 --> 01:23:48.974
You'll be following on.

01:23:56.607 --> 01:23:57.774
Hand these out to the men!

01:23:58.775 --> 01:23:59.943
Don't worry, men!

01:24:00.944 --> 01:24:02.779
We'll all be fine
come the Final Victory!

01:24:41.818 --> 01:24:43.070
The shoe-testing squad.

01:24:44.821 --> 01:24:45.989
They're not there anymore.

01:25:27.864 --> 01:25:29.032
What are you doing here?

01:25:30.867 --> 01:25:34.621
I forgot something.

01:25:34.705 --> 01:25:36.289
Sorowitsch, I warn you.

01:25:36.373 --> 01:25:39.292
If I'm harmed,
you'll all be liquidated!

01:25:39.376 --> 01:25:41.128
I'm your only chance of surviving!

01:25:52.055 --> 01:25:53.223
Do you want the money?

01:25:55.058 --> 01:25:56.476
We can share the money!

01:25:59.563 --> 01:26:00.814
Is it about Kolya?

01:26:02.733 --> 01:26:04.317
It was Holst who shot him!

01:26:04.401 --> 01:26:07.988
I know you think
Holst was only following orders.

01:26:08.071 --> 01:26:09.406
But what do you think I did?

01:26:13.410 --> 01:26:15.495
I always treated you well!

01:26:15.579 --> 01:26:17.831
No other prisoners
were treated so well as here!

01:26:19.249 --> 01:26:21.418
I can't save the entire
Jewish race on my own!

01:26:25.422 --> 01:26:27.841
One has to look after oneself.

01:26:28.925 --> 01:26:30.427
You know that better than anyone.

01:26:38.769 --> 01:26:41.188
You've pissed yourself.

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:45.001
What's happened here, Sally?

01:27:46.002 --> 01:27:47.170
Herzog.

01:27:48.255 --> 01:27:51.591
- You haven't...?
- I wanted to kill him, but...

01:27:53.093 --> 01:27:54.511
I let him go.

01:28:00.559 --> 01:28:02.060
They'll put us up against a wall.

01:28:07.190 --> 01:28:10.277
That would've suited you,
wouldn't it?

01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:12.154
If they'd shot you too.

01:28:14.781 --> 01:28:16.449
It's over.

01:28:17.409 --> 01:28:18.702
The war's over.

01:28:20.537 --> 01:28:22.122
No one will come for us now.

01:28:23.874 --> 01:28:26.751
I'm just not cut out
to play the martyr.

01:28:26.835 --> 01:28:28.003
Got any cards?

01:28:39.890 --> 01:28:43.643
Our people have taken over
the camp! This is the end.

01:28:43.727 --> 01:28:45.061
We're free!

01:28:46.938 --> 01:28:48.899
Dr. Klinger, internal medicine.

01:28:50.483 --> 01:28:53.820
We're the inmates
from Blocks 18 and 19.

01:28:53.904 --> 01:28:56.072
I know him! He's SS!

01:28:56.156 --> 01:28:58.158
No, no, no!

01:28:58.241 --> 01:29:00.619
Operation Bernhard.

01:29:00.744 --> 01:29:03.288
- We're prisoners!
- Mow them down, the scum!

01:29:03.371 --> 01:29:04.497
We're Jews.

01:29:04.581 --> 01:29:05.832
Shoot them, the fat pigs!

01:29:05.916 --> 01:29:07.667
Here!
Jewish nose, big ears!

01:29:07.751 --> 01:29:09.377
Don't shoot.
We're prisoners.

01:29:09.461 --> 01:29:10.879
Here, Auschwitz!

01:29:12.714 --> 01:29:14.299
Who else was in Auschwitz?

01:30:16.611 --> 01:30:20.573
We let the negatives
for the dollar overheat,

01:30:20.657 --> 01:30:23.159
to make the contours blur.

01:30:24.286 --> 01:30:26.496
They threatened to shoot us.

01:30:27.497 --> 01:30:29.582
This is Burger!
He's a hero!

01:30:29.666 --> 01:30:31.167
Say something!

01:30:32.752 --> 01:30:35.088
And then it was too late!

01:30:35.171 --> 01:30:37.424
The dollar would have changed
the course of the war.

01:30:37.507 --> 01:30:40.593
They'd have had heaps of dough.

01:30:43.305 --> 01:30:45.849
Sometimes we heard
that lovely music.

01:30:55.775 --> 01:30:59.696
We made the pound here.

01:30:59.779 --> 01:31:00.947
Clever, eh?

01:31:18.673 --> 01:31:20.675
I told him he had to keep going.

01:31:23.678 --> 01:31:25.013
I only said...

01:31:25.096 --> 01:31:27.307
he had to survive
until it was over.

01:31:30.226 --> 01:31:31.353
What an idiot.

01:31:31.436 --> 01:31:32.771
Best get away from here.

01:31:35.732 --> 01:31:37.150
Forget all about it!

01:31:45.408 --> 01:31:50.413
Where do I take him?
He's dead.

01:32:09.307 --> 01:32:10.642
Full house.

01:32:22.487 --> 01:32:23.738
Full house.

01:33:30.263 --> 01:33:31.431
To change?

01:33:31.514 --> 01:33:33.516
No, for the staff.

01:33:40.523 --> 01:33:43.109
May I offer you a bottle
of champagne on the house?

01:34:08.384 --> 01:34:10.470
You had bad luck?

01:34:17.227 --> 01:34:18.811
So much money!

01:34:29.072 --> 01:34:30.657
So much money!

01:34:31.574 --> 01:34:33.743
We can always make us some more.

01:34:39.249 --> 01:34:41.918
The Sachsenhausen
counterfeiting workshop

01:34:42.001 --> 01:34:44.420
forged pound notes to
a total value of 132 million...

01:34:45.421 --> 01:34:48.758
equivalent to four times Britain's
foreign currency reserves.

01:34:49.968 --> 01:34:52.178
Thanks to the inmates'
delaying tactics,

01:34:52.262 --> 01:34:54.931
only a very small number
of dollars was produced.

01:34:56.432 --> 01:34:58.351
"Operation Bernhard" remains

01:34:58.434 --> 01:35:00.937
the largest counterfeiting
operation of all time.
