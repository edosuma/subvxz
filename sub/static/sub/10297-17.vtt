ANNOUNCER:
 <i>Last week on</i>
Married With Children,

01:17.234 --> 01:20.968
 <i>Peggy was excited about going</i>
 <i>to their high school reunion,</i>

01:20.968 --> 01:23.968
 <i>because she was sure</i>
 <i>she'd be named reunion queen.</i>

01:23.968 --> 01:26.267
 <i>Al was excited too.</i>

01:26.267 --> 01:29.400
 <i>Meanwhile the kids</i>
 <i>are starving.</i>

01:29.400 --> 01:31.167
 <i>Peggy's competition</i>
 <i>for the crown</i>

01:31.167 --> 01:34.167
 <i>is her old high school rival:</i>
 <i>Connie Bender.</i>

01:34.167 --> 01:36.167
 <i>Al meets his rival, Jack,</i>

01:36.167 --> 01:37.667
 <i>who wants</i>
 <i>to pick up the fight</i>

01:37.667 --> 01:39.234
 <i>they never had</i>
 <i>in high school.</i>

01:39.234 --> 01:41.934
 <i>At the reunion, Peggy learned</i>
 <i>Connie has bought enough votes</i>

01:41.934 --> 01:43.434
 <i>to win the crown,</i>

01:43.434 --> 01:45.767
 <i>and it looks like</i>
 <i>Peggy's not going to be queen.</i>

01:45.767 --> 01:47.601
 <i>The kids are still</i>
 <i>starving.</i>

01:47.601 --> 01:50.701
 <i>And now,</i> Married With Children
 <i>continues.</i>

01:56.534 --> 01:58.801
Getting
a second chin?

01:58.801 --> 02:00.534
Getting a second
forehead?

02:03.801 --> 02:05.000
Gee, Peggy,

02:05.000 --> 02:08.434
I hope this doesn't ruin
the reunion for you.

02:08.434 --> 02:10.267
Oh, don't worry,
Connie.

02:10.267 --> 02:14.367
Seeing you look this old
more than makes up for it.

02:14.367 --> 02:15.367
Come on, Jack.

02:15.367 --> 02:16.868
They're serving
the shrimp cups.

02:16.868 --> 02:19.501
See you at
my coronation, Wanker.

02:19.501 --> 02:22.534
She still smells
like a bunch of men.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.534
Oh, Al.

02:27.534 --> 02:29.734
I'm not gonna
be reunion queen.

02:29.734 --> 02:33.200
I'll never know what it feels
like to wear that crown.

02:33.200 --> 02:35.100
I'll never know
what it feels like

02:35.100 --> 02:38.868
to have warm eggs and hot coffee
in my own home...

02:38.868 --> 02:42.033
so you'll pardon me
if I don't feel your sorrow.

02:42.033 --> 02:44.868
Ten bucks says Al Bundy
can drive his head

02:44.868 --> 02:46.434
right through the door.

02:46.434 --> 02:48.467
Oh, no.

02:48.467 --> 02:50.767
Aw, hey, big Al!
AL: Eli!

02:50.767 --> 02:52.367
How are you, Al?

02:52.367 --> 02:54.367
It's good to see you.

02:54.367 --> 02:55.968
Hello, Peggy.

02:55.968 --> 02:57.467
Don't touch me, Eli.

02:57.467 --> 02:59.834
Okay. No problem.
No problem.

02:59.834 --> 03:01.601
You know,
you marrying Peg

03:01.601 --> 03:03.467
was the only bet
I ever lost.

03:03.467 --> 03:05.801
Me too.

03:05.801 --> 03:07.968
So, what are you doing
these days, Eli?

03:07.968 --> 03:10.133
I'm a psychiatrist.
What do you do?

03:10.133 --> 03:11.634
A garbage salesman.

03:11.634 --> 03:13.234
Ah, that's great.
That's great. Come on.

03:13.234 --> 03:15.234
Say, why don't you say hello
to the gang.

03:15.234 --> 03:16.467
They're sitting
over there.

03:16.467 --> 03:17.734
I'm sitting
with the jocks.

03:17.734 --> 03:19.234
Why don't you
join them, huh?

03:19.234 --> 03:20.734
Oh, after you.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.300
Ooh, and after...

03:24.300 --> 03:25.667
Bundy!               Bundy!
Bundy!

03:25.667 --> 03:27.400
Al, how you
doing?

03:27.400 --> 03:28.701
Jimbo.
Yeah.

03:28.701 --> 03:30.367

Yeah!

03:30.367 --> 03:31.367
Ah...

03:31.367 --> 03:33.100
Uh...

03:33.100 --> 03:34.100

03:34.100 --> 03:35.567
How you doing, Al?

03:35.567 --> 03:36.601
[COUGHS]

03:36.601 --> 03:38.133
Gee, Speedy,
you're looking great.

03:38.133 --> 03:39.300
Exercise.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.601
I'm a golfer.

03:41.601 --> 03:44.367
You look like you could
still play football, Al, huh?

03:44.367 --> 03:46.000
How do you
stay in shape?

03:46.000 --> 03:47.367
Running from Peg
on sex nights.

03:49.067 --> 03:50.868
Al. Al.

03:50.868 --> 03:52.801
You want to see
something funny?

03:52.801 --> 03:54.300
You remember
the nerds,

03:54.300 --> 03:56.801
Tyrone
and Milton?

03:56.801 --> 03:58.767
The guy who used to
eat his pen?

03:58.767 --> 04:00.567
Look at him over there
with the other nerds,

04:00.567 --> 04:02.367
still sitting
together.

04:06.834 --> 04:09.701
You should have done
your own homework, guys!

04:11.100 --> 04:13.200
Aw, eat your pen,
Milton.

04:14.167 --> 04:15.534
Hey, Peggy.

04:15.534 --> 04:18.534
Did you hear Connie Bender's
gonna be reunion queen?

04:18.534 --> 04:21.767
Hey, Speedy. Did you hear
there's a new invention?

04:21.767 --> 04:23.634
It's called breath spray.

04:23.634 --> 04:27.133
Now, I'm gonna go try to get
some more votes for queen.

04:27.133 --> 04:28.634
You guys just sit back

04:28.634 --> 04:30.634
and reminisce
about being human.

04:30.634 --> 04:33.467
Oh, and don't you do
anything stupid.

04:34.634 --> 04:35.801
Ugh!

04:35.801 --> 04:37.067
Don't worry,
beautiful.

04:37.067 --> 04:38.467
I'll keep
an eye on him.

04:39.434 --> 04:41.100
Say, Al.

04:41.100 --> 04:45.000
I just happen to have
this nail here.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.367
Ten bucks says
Bundy can drive it

04:47.367 --> 04:49.267
through this table
with his head.

04:49.267 --> 04:50.534
Aw, come on, guys.

04:50.534 --> 04:52.300
I don't do that
kind of thing anymore.

04:52.300 --> 04:53.367
I'm an adult now.

04:53.367 --> 04:54.934
Oh, hey...

04:54.934 --> 04:56.100
What happened?

04:56.100 --> 04:58.100
Your head ain't as hard
as it used to be?

04:58.100 --> 04:59.601
Huh, Al? Huh?

04:59.601 --> 05:01.200
Place your bets.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.400
All right.
Come on.

05:03.400 --> 05:06.601
Well, the boot soup
is almost ready.

05:09.501 --> 05:10.901
Let it simmer,
Kel.

05:10.901 --> 05:12.033
I've got a plan.

05:12.033 --> 05:13.501
Now, you know
what they have

05:13.501 --> 05:14.701
at reunions,
don't you?

05:14.701 --> 05:17.701
A lot of old drunks
to roll?

05:18.901 --> 05:20.567
Food, Bimbostein.

05:22.701 --> 05:24.033
We're gonna crash
this party

05:24.033 --> 05:25.767
and get some
for ourselves.

05:25.767 --> 05:27.234
They'll never
let us in.

05:27.234 --> 05:28.734
We're under 80.

05:30.434 --> 05:32.267
I'll take care
of that.

05:32.267 --> 05:34.901
Now, we just need
some information.

05:34.901 --> 05:37.267
And I know the two
all-day suckers

05:37.267 --> 05:39.000
who can give it to us.

05:40.767 --> 05:42.901
Mr. and Mrs. Rhoades.

05:42.901 --> 05:44.834
Good of you to come.

05:44.834 --> 05:47.400
You said you needed some help
with your homework?

05:47.400 --> 05:50.934
Yes. Do either of you know
anything about ancient history?

05:50.934 --> 05:52.834
Why, yes we do.

05:52.834 --> 05:54.868
Tell us about
the 1960s.

05:57.567 --> 05:59.734
Well, strife
was rampant

05:59.734 --> 06:02.167
because of
the civil war.

06:02.167 --> 06:03.767
But then came
electricity,

06:03.767 --> 06:05.234
and before
you know it,

06:05.234 --> 06:06.567
Marcie and I
went home.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.067
Come on, Marcie.

06:08.067 --> 06:09.267
Oh, now, Steve.

06:09.267 --> 06:12.334
Their little minds are
reaching out for knowledge.

06:12.334 --> 06:15.334
Why, of course
we remember the '60s.

06:15.334 --> 06:17.834
And, oh, what a time it was.

06:17.834 --> 06:19.968
Incense and peppermints.

06:21.767 --> 06:23.434
Young Republican meetings.

06:28.100 --> 06:29.667
Yeah. We cared
about things

06:29.667 --> 06:31.367
in those days, kids.

06:31.367 --> 06:33.634
I remember protesting
the dress code

06:33.634 --> 06:35.934
in our school.

06:35.934 --> 06:37.667
I still remember
the principal's face

06:37.667 --> 06:40.200
when we all took the pennies
out of our loafers

06:40.200 --> 06:41.767
and wore our shirts
out of our pants.

06:45.300 --> 06:47.300
And, if that
wasn't enough,

06:47.300 --> 06:50.901
one day, I even put
a little dimple in my tie.

06:50.901 --> 06:52.234
He's a rebel,

06:52.234 --> 06:55.000
and he'll never ever
be any good.

the wrong people.

another thing

07:04.467 --> 07:06.234
I said I'd never do.

07:08.767 --> 07:11.200
Well, yes, I do need
the votes,

07:11.200 --> 07:13.634
but, um, I don't
do that anymore.

07:15.701 --> 07:18.567
But could you
vote for me anyway?

07:33.901 --> 07:35.300
Oh, I've been
fine.

07:35.300 --> 07:37.667

from your stealing Teddy,

07:37.667 --> 07:38.834
my high-school sweetheart

07:38.834 --> 07:40.334
and the only man
I've ever loved.

07:40.334 --> 07:43.100
Of course, you dumped him
a week later.

You stole
my boyfriend.

07:46.234 --> 07:47.934
You stole

a Connie table, huh?
