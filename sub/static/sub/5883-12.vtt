00:42.167 --> 00:45.086
Mr. Campbell. Mr. Campbell.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.673
l got your hot cocoa.

00:52.720 --> 00:53.886
Wonderful.

00:53.971 --> 00:57.640
l just got back from lunch,
and Mr. Pryce wants to see you.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.894
-lt's instant.
-lt's from the diner.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.438
l don't know how you can tell.

01:03.522 --> 01:06.816
You can tell because
they use water instead of milk.

01:08.152 --> 01:10.987
lt's warmer outside. lt's ridiculous.

01:12.030 --> 01:15.241
The building will take care of it.
They always do.

01:16.493 --> 01:20.413
Sorry about that.
This really is hitting the spot.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.213
Come in.

01:32.885 --> 01:34.302
Have a seat.

01:38.265 --> 01:41.517
l believe l have
what is rather disappointing news.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.187
lt's been decided that Mr. Cosgrove

01:44.271 --> 01:47.857
will be made senior vice president
in charge of account services,

01:47.941 --> 01:51.027
and you will be made
head of account management.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.280
Really?

01:54.364 --> 01:57.158
This is not to ignore
that you've distinguished yourself

01:57.242 --> 02:00.036
and been of great service to the company.

02:00.162 --> 02:03.456
What is it based on?
Our billings are neck and neck.

02:04.541 --> 02:09.378
ln fact, l think l've done a lot with
what l was given in this arbitrary scheme.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.672
lt's become apparent

02:12.549 --> 02:17.136
that you are excellent at making the clients
feel their needs are being met,

02:17.596 --> 02:20.473
but Mr. Cosgrove has the rare gift
of making them feel

02:20.557 --> 02:22.725
as if they haven't any needs.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.355
-l see.
-l improved your title.

02:28.857 --> 02:32.610
And you tell your clients
there'll be no need to be deprecating.

02:32.694 --> 02:36.489
-Bert and Roger know about this?
-This is under my authority.

02:37.199 --> 02:40.910
And l have to commend you
on taking it as well as you have.

02:49.086 --> 02:52.129
-l hope this was a difficult decision.
-lt was.

03:06.270 --> 03:07.770
There you go.

03:20.117 --> 03:22.827
-Where are you going?
-l don't feel well.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.706
Why did you pick that place?

03:26.790 --> 03:30.084
l don't know why a lunch counter
is any better than eating at your desk.

03:30.168 --> 03:32.086
Well, you could've joined me for a drink.

03:32.170 --> 03:35.214
l can drink at my desk if l want to,
and l'm not out $1 .25.

03:35.299 --> 03:39.010
l'm sorry l'm not as stimulating
a lunch companion as Doug.

03:39.553 --> 03:43.973
-lt's Duck, and l work most lunches.
-Well, l don't like his aftershave.

03:44.391 --> 03:47.476
l can smell it on you, and l can smell it
in the bathroom in the morning.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.437
What's wrong with him?

03:49.521 --> 03:53.482
Nothing. l don't even know
why l'm weighing in on men right now.

03:53.609 --> 03:56.485
l think it's good
that you're being picky, finally.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.905
Well, there's nothing around
but married ones.

03:58.989 --> 04:01.824
l mean, we can't all
throw caution to the wind.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.826
But Duck's not married.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.829
Then why are you with him?

04:11.668 --> 04:14.921
-Well, this is me. You working late tonight?
-l don't know yet.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.505
-Okay.
-Bye.

04:20.010 --> 04:23.804
Wow. Van Cleef.
How very Jane Siegel-Sterling.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.559
-They're blue and they're new.
-She's trying.

04:29.353 --> 04:31.354
You always take her side.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.357
l do not.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.069
She started giving me advice.

04:38.904 --> 04:42.281
"Don't go to bed angry.
Let them do what they want.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.575
"Dress sexy."

04:45.202 --> 04:48.955
And all l kept thinking about was Daddy.
lt's disgusting.

04:49.790 --> 04:53.709
Doesn't she know that?
That she ruined my life?

04:55.712 --> 04:57.880
Your father had a part in it.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.384
You don't think l know that?

05:02.886 --> 05:07.181
-Brooks is different than your father.
-l don't want to get married.

05:08.934 --> 05:13.980
Everything's pointing to the fact
that l shouldn't, and everybody knows.

05:14.564 --> 05:19.610
Brooks knows. His mother knows.
Do you know what she said to me?

05:21.738 --> 05:26.325
She said in lndia, if the wedding
doesn't take place at the appointed hour,

05:26.910 --> 05:28.577
they burn the bride.

05:28.662 --> 05:32.581
Just because she went to lndia
doesn't mean she's not an idiot.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.251
And Jane. lf she's coming,

05:37.921 --> 05:39.422
l'm not going.

05:39.923 --> 05:44.176
She's coming, because your father's coming
and he paid for everything.

05:44.261 --> 05:47.179
You're having the wedding.
The bride will not be burned.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.682
Turn those earrings
into a tea service or something.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.684
-Aren't you listening to me?
-l am,

05:51.768 --> 05:54.562
and you're babbling like a little fool.
Go to your room.

05:54.646 --> 05:55.813
-What?
-You heard me.

05:55.897 --> 05:59.316
You want to act like a child,
l'll treat you like one.

06:05.282 --> 06:07.241
Would somebody get that?

06:14.750 --> 06:16.250
-Hello?
-Daddy?

06:17.627 --> 06:19.128
Are you alone?

06:19.212 --> 06:21.589
-Yes, what's wrong?
-Nothing's right.

06:21.673 --> 06:25.760
My bridesmaids are supposed to give me
something blue and something new.

06:25.844 --> 06:28.679
-Or Mommy. She should know that.
-Who?

06:29.306 --> 06:33.184
l don't like her, Daddy, and l've told you
l don't want her to be there.

06:33.852 --> 06:37.772
-Honey, put your mother on the phone.
-He wants to talk to you.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.405
You have to keep Jane under control.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.699
Well, first of all, tell the bride
that everything is copacetic.

06:48.784 --> 06:51.452
We both agree that she's nuts
and she should shut up.

06:52.245 --> 06:55.498
Your father said that he's sorry
and that Jane will stay out of your way

06:55.582 --> 06:58.584
-and that we're both tired of the drama.
-He said all that?

06:58.668 --> 07:00.920
l'm not playing chicken anymore.
lf she wants to cancel the wedding,

07:01.004 --> 07:02.838
l'll take the deposit out of her inheritance.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.841
-He said the wedding's off.
-Fine.

07:06.510 --> 07:09.512
You mean that?
You're not worried about lndia?

07:09.763 --> 07:13.390
-Why are you doing this?
-Do you want to cancel it or not?

07:15.310 --> 07:16.435
No.

07:16.520 --> 07:20.189
Then go eat something.
l'm not taking that dress in again.

07:26.071 --> 07:28.989
Why did Jane get her
such an expensive gift?

07:29.866 --> 07:31.367
l didn't even know they saw each other.

07:31.535 --> 07:34.036
-Of course you didn't.
-l forbid it.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.790
-Can't wait to get her out of here.
-Everything okay?

07:39.709 --> 07:43.963
Goodbye.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.758
Jane! Get in here, now.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.429
-l didn't know you were home.
-l overdid it at lunch,

07:52.514 --> 07:54.265
as did you, l heard.

07:54.683 --> 07:57.935
l'm sorry, sweetheart.
l just wanted to make amends.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.228
l got her a beautiful present.

07:59.312 --> 08:03.482
Why the hell are you even talking to her?
You're screwing things up!

08:03.567 --> 08:07.319
l'm tired of the awkwardness,
and l'm trying to be nice.

08:08.029 --> 08:11.115
And l don't know
what kind of world you live in,

08:11.491 --> 08:14.118
-but l am the good person here.
-You're not good,

08:14.202 --> 08:17.746
because you didn't listen to me
and you really upset her.

08:21.751 --> 08:24.128
Everything you do is for her.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.089
l'm your wife.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.176
And guess what?
l live here and l get to do what l want to do,

08:30.260 --> 08:33.345
so stop trying to tell me
that you know better.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.728
-You'd better not have locked that door.
-Go away!

08:41.271 --> 08:43.606
Or what? You'll commit suicide?

08:53.241 --> 08:56.994
-Peter, what are you doing home?
-l got fired.

08:59.623 --> 09:01.123
What happened?

09:03.293 --> 09:08.964
Lane told me Kenny is senior something
of something accounts and l'm not.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.051
l'm account something.

09:14.054 --> 09:18.390
l couldn't even hear him.
All l saw was his frog-like mouth flapping.

09:19.309 --> 09:22.228
-So, did he ask you to leave?
-No.

09:24.814 --> 09:28.275
l have to ask this,
but did you lose your temper?

09:29.486 --> 09:30.986
No, l didn't.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.531
That's good. That's very good.

09:36.409 --> 09:40.829
Do you remember if he said anything
about how much they want you to stay?

09:41.331 --> 09:44.291
-No.
-That's good, too. So it didn't come up.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.419
Trudy, stop it with the Ellery Queen.

09:51.466 --> 09:54.176
-l'm going to call Duck.
-No, you're not.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.971
They would have fired you
if they wanted to fire you.

09:57.055 --> 09:59.682
You need to wait and see how it goes.

10:00.392 --> 10:04.687
He basically said l care too much
about my clients and they notice it.

10:05.188 --> 10:07.022
How could that be bad?

10:08.525 --> 10:11.777
Peter, you hold all the cards.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.242
lt's going to be fine.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.515
l thought you'd left.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.351
-l'm here.
-l see.

10:48.732 --> 10:51.859
-Well, thank you.
-l've done it before.

10:54.571 --> 10:56.113
Go back to bed.

11:06.082 --> 11:09.251
-Do you want anything?
-No. l'll be in, in a bit.

11:17.010 --> 11:21.930
-lt's got to be 1 00 degrees in here.
-You ask the building for heat, you get heat.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.391
Mr. Herman on line one.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.147
-Hello? Can you give me a minute?
-No.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.984
l'm right around the corner
at the ElysÃ©e, room 531 .

11:35.570 --> 11:40.240
-l'm in the middle of something.
-Pee wee, sweetheart, it's been three weeks.

11:40.450 --> 11:44.328
You can get room service. l think they have
a Monte Cristo sandwich. You love that.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.997
l'm having lunch with Kurt and Smitty.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.458
They're a couple of homos.
Tell them you have plans.

11:53.630 --> 11:57.383
-lt's kind of short notice.
-Come on, Creative, be creative.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.350
l have to go to the printer.

12:07.477 --> 12:11.105
-l know a nooner when l hear one.
-You're disgusting.

12:12.148 --> 12:14.358
No, Bob did.

12:15.318 --> 12:16.402
Bob?

12:16.861 --> 12:18.904
l was hoping to catch you
on your way to lunch.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.280
Too late.

12:21.491 --> 12:25.411
-I must say I'm surprised.
-Frankly, I was a little suspicious...

12:25.495 --> 12:30.207
l found out yesterday that head of accounts
is going to Kenny and his haircut.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.418
-l heard.
-This is the first time he's invited her here...

12:32.502 --> 12:35.087
-Can you turn that off?
-Not really.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.091
Did you ask him why he invited her?

12:39.175 --> 12:43.595
He said something about not wanting her
to actually have to get involved.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.640
-Were you consulted?
-After the fact.

12:48.810 --> 12:52.521
-What does it mean?
-lt's not good.

12:54.190 --> 12:58.068
l know it's not good.
There's no future for me here.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.532
-How did you do it? You made yourjob up.
-l didn't.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.993
l looked at other agencies
and saw that they had TV departments

13:06.077 --> 13:07.286
and wondered why we didn't.

13:07.370 --> 13:10.539
Well, there's no such thing
in the accounts field.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.625
-There's marketing.
-That's a research job.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.505
-ls this official?
-Yes.

13:19.007 --> 13:21.133
l'm afraid we can't hire Mr. Charcot.

13:21.217 --> 13:24.428
Well, at least you had the guts
to send me a memo.

13:24.512 --> 13:27.806
-He's far too expensive.
-Salvatore Romano is gone.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.017
There is no one in charge
of the art department.

13:30.101 --> 13:32.644
l haven't heard a complaint
from any of the clients.

13:32.729 --> 13:37.149
-Jesus! lt's hotter in here than in my office.
-That's because you're overexcited.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.443
Do you want me to walk you through
a delivery schedule?

13:43.823 --> 13:46.533
This is walter Cronkite in our newsroom,

13:47.744 --> 13:50.037
and there has been an attempt,
as perhaps you know now,

13:50.121 --> 13:51.663
on the life of President Kennedy.

13:51.748 --> 13:56.335
He was wounded in an automobile driving
from Dallas Airport into downtown Dallas

13:56.419 --> 13:58.504
along with Governor Connally of Texas.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.839
They've been taken
to Parkland Hospital there,

14:00.924 --> 14:03.383
where their condition is as yet...

14:09.807 --> 14:12.351
My God, how much
have you been smoking in here?

14:12.435 --> 14:14.061
Sorry about that.

14:19.400 --> 14:23.612
-l'm glad you ran over.
-Me too.

14:26.950 --> 14:30.035
l don't understand. l can't run
my department without an art director.

14:30.119 --> 14:34.456
-You want to call Saint John?
-Bert Cooper still has a say around here.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.467
Hello. What?

14:45.927 --> 14:48.804
lf they wanted to fire you,
they would've fired you.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.639
l'm gonna die at this desk, unnoticed.

14:50.723 --> 14:54.101
Do you have any idea
what l've done for this company?

14:54.477 --> 14:55.477
-What are you doing?
-Christ!

14:55.562 --> 14:56.645
-Somebody shot the president.
-Turn on the TV.

14:56.729 --> 14:57.854
What?

14:59.315 --> 15:01.733
...top of the president's car was down.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.027
They drew their pistols,
but the damage was done.

15:04.112 --> 15:05.737
-Oh, my God. Unbelievable.
-The president was slumped over

15:05.822 --> 15:07.948
in the backseat of the car, face down,

15:08.032 --> 15:10.993
then Governor Connally,
after slumping to the left for a moment,

15:11.077 --> 15:13.328
lay on the floor of the rear seats.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.913
-Oh, my God.
-Dear God.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.331
ls he dead?

15:29.053 --> 15:31.096
What the hell is going on?

15:37.520 --> 15:42.441
Every person listening at this moment
has flashed back to that day in April, 1945,

15:43.109 --> 15:45.861
when Franklin Delano Roosevelt...

15:45.945 --> 15:49.906
Excuse me, Chet, here is a flash
from the Associated Press, dateline Dallas.

15:49.991 --> 15:52.284
Two priests
who were with President Kennedy

15:52.368 --> 15:54.703
say he is dead of bullet wounds.

15:54.871 --> 15:58.874
There is no further confirmation,
but this is what we have on a flash basis...

15:58.958 --> 16:02.002
-ls he okay?
-They just said he died.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.046
Two priests in Dallas
who were with President Kennedy

16:04.130 --> 16:06.465
say he is dead of bullet wounds.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.592
-Oh, lord.
-There is no further confirmation.

16:08.676 --> 16:13.722
This is the only word we have indicating
the president may, in fact, have lost his life.

16:13.806 --> 16:17.309
It has just moved
on the Associated Press wires from Dallas.

16:17.393 --> 16:20.812
The two priests were called to the hospital
to administer the last rites...

16:20.897 --> 16:22.439
-Oh, my goodness.
-...of the Roman Catholic Church,

16:22.523 --> 16:24.941
-and it is from them we get the word...
-l know.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.526
...that the president has died,

16:26.611 --> 16:29.613
that the bullet wounds inflicted on him
as he rode in a motorcade

16:29.697 --> 16:32.240
through downtown Dallas have been fatal.

16:32.325 --> 16:37.412
We would remind you there is no official
confirmation of this from any source as yet.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.498
Bill, just moments before
you brought the flash,

16:39.582 --> 16:40.707
I had word from the hospital

16:40.792 --> 16:44.336
that the vice president, Lyndon Johnson,
and his wife had just left the hospital,

16:44.420 --> 16:46.129
been rushed away into a...

16:47.298 --> 16:49.299
Did you give me a hickey?

16:49.425 --> 16:52.594
-l don't think so.
-l told you l don't like that.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.639
l get questions from my mother.

16:57.016 --> 17:01.186
Listen, there was a news story
that was on right before you came in.

17:03.106 --> 17:07.192
-lt's been distracting me.
-You didn't seem distracted.

17:09.862 --> 17:14.241
-l just want to see what's going on.
-What's going on?

17:17.829 --> 17:22.290
Because it was only on October the 24th
that our ambassador to the United Nations,

17:22.375 --> 17:27.462
Adlai Stevenson, was assaulted in Dallas
leaving a dinner meeting there.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.802
From Dallas, Texas,
the flash, apparently official,

17:34.137 --> 17:39.182
President Kennedy died at 1 :00 p.m.
Central Standard Time,

17:39.809 --> 17:41.226
2:00 Eastern Standard Time...

17:41.310 --> 17:43.562
-Jesus.
-Oh, my God.

17:43.646 --> 17:46.356
-...some 38 minutes ago.
-What happened?

17:49.569 --> 17:53.780
Vice President Lyndon Johnson
has left the hospital in Dallas.

17:53.865 --> 17:55.323
-l've gotta call my kids.
-We do not know

17:55.408 --> 17:57.451
to where he has proceeded.

17:57.577 --> 18:01.329
Presumably, he will be taking
the oath of office shortly

18:01.581 --> 18:05.333
and become
the 36th President of the United...

18:05.418 --> 18:09.796
President Johnson is under heavy guard
and was whisked away from the hospital...

18:09.881 --> 18:10.922
lt's ruined.

18:11.007 --> 18:14.760
-President Kennedy, we are now informed...
-lt's all ruined.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.513
lt's gonna be ruined.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.100
...five-year-old boy and myself

18:22.185 --> 18:25.604
were by ourselves on the grass there
on Palmer Street,

18:25.688 --> 18:27.105
-and I asked Joe to wave to him...
-Betts?

18:27.190 --> 18:30.108
...and Joe waved and I waved,
and the man...

18:31.360 --> 18:34.321
That's all right, sir. Go ahead and tell it.

18:35.239 --> 18:40.118
As he was waving back, he was...
The shot rang out, and he slumped down...

18:40.203 --> 18:43.205
-Where's your mother?
-She's not feeling well.

18:44.874 --> 18:49.461
He was slumping down and the second
shot went off and just knocked him down.

18:50.838 --> 18:54.841
-l can't stop crying.
-No, sir, I did not see the man who did it.

18:56.385 --> 18:59.971
All I did was look in the man's face
when he was shot there...

19:00.056 --> 19:02.390
Why are the kids watching this?

19:03.726 --> 19:07.813
What am l supposed to do, Don?
Am l supposed to keep it from them?

19:08.439 --> 19:11.817
...that it hit him and he went
all the way down in the car.

19:11.901 --> 19:15.362
Take a pill and lie down.
l can handle the kids.

19:15.613 --> 19:19.115
...fell on him in hopes
that there wasn't a maniac around.

19:19.200 --> 19:24.037
I'm sorry, I can't help you more,
but I won't forget it.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.749
-Turn this off. l'll make us some dinner.
-A Polaroid picture

19:27.834 --> 19:30.669
taken by another witness,
Mary Moorman of Dallas,

19:30.753 --> 19:33.755
showing the president
slumped over in the car.

19:34.340 --> 19:39.177
Just as Mary started to take the picture,
the president came right even with us,

19:39.512 --> 19:42.973
-two shots... We looked at him...
-You two, look at me.

19:43.266 --> 19:45.976
Two shots rang out
and he grabbed his chest.

19:46.060 --> 19:47.519
Everything's gonna be okay.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.688
...on his face and fell across,
towards Jackie...

19:49.772 --> 19:52.399
-We have a new president...
-And she...

19:52.567 --> 19:54.776
-...and we're all gonna be sad for a little bit.
-...fell over on him

19:54.861 --> 19:56.194
and said, "My God, he's shot!"

19:56.279 --> 19:58.697
And then on Monday
there's gonna be a funeral.

19:58.781 --> 20:00.365
Are we going to the funeral?

20:00.449 --> 20:04.578
...more shots rang out, but by that time
the motorcade had sped away.

20:04.662 --> 20:07.789
What prompted you to take the picture
at that particular instance?

20:07.874 --> 20:10.375
Well, that's the only chance I had.

20:12.253 --> 20:14.296
For the nation and the world,

20:14.380 --> 20:17.215
Mrs. Rockefeller and I
join with all New Yorkers

20:17.300 --> 20:20.468
and every American in extending heartfelt...

20:48.289 --> 20:52.167
...chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba,
a pro-Castro organization,

20:52.251 --> 20:56.254
where he had been arrested
on disturbance of the peace charges.

20:56.339 --> 20:59.007
He denied he was a communist,
said he was a Marxist,

20:59.091 --> 21:02.677
and claimed there was quite a difference
between the two.

21:02.845 --> 21:05.513
Police in Dallas have just announced...

21:05.723 --> 21:09.434
-You should get ready. lt's almost 2:00.
-Really, Don?

21:09.518 --> 21:14.272
...has gunpowder traces on both hands,
indicating he'd recently used a rifle,

21:14.357 --> 21:17.359
the type of weapon
that killed Mr. Kennedy yesterday.

21:17.443 --> 21:20.403
As we told you a short time ago,
Oswald has refused...

21:20.488 --> 21:22.155
He's 24 years old.

21:23.950 --> 21:26.952
In Washington,
the body of the late president

21:27.036 --> 21:29.454
lies in the East Room of the White House...

21:29.538 --> 21:32.374
-Come on, Betts.
-...as official Washington and members of...

21:32.458 --> 21:36.252
Are you sure they haven't canceled it?
lt said in The Times they were doing that.

21:36.337 --> 21:38.922
l'm not gonna call Roger to find out.

21:39.715 --> 21:42.509
lf we go in and it's off,
we'll grab dinner or something.

21:42.593 --> 21:45.136
...third-floor living quarters
of the White House...

21:45.221 --> 21:49.474
-l can't sit in front of the TV all day.
-Fine.

21:50.434 --> 21:54.187
...ailing Mr. Kennedy stricken by a stroke
two years ago...

21:54.271 --> 21:56.523
Just stay here until Carla comes.

21:56.607 --> 22:00.151
...greatly, increasingly failing health
for the last...

22:00.820 --> 22:04.739
After the terrible news had reached us,

22:06.325 --> 22:08.952
-60,000 Berliners...
-Can you see bags?

22:09.495 --> 22:13.999
-l don't understand this. Here we are.
-...gathered with torches in their hands.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.209
Lyndon Johnson, more of the same.

22:16.293 --> 22:21.089
Nobody voted for him. lt felt for a second
like everything was about to change.

22:21.966 --> 22:27.262
You should get your coat and your scarf.
l know it's far, but l really feel like walking.

22:27.430 --> 22:29.097
Why are we going?

22:29.181 --> 22:31.474
Because it's your boss's
daughter's wedding.

22:31.559 --> 22:35.437
lt's business, Pete, and there's a system.
You always say that.

22:35.521 --> 22:38.940
lt's one thing to go to this wedding
and act like l don't hate them.

22:39.025 --> 22:43.445
lt's another thing to go and act
like the president hasn't been murdered.

22:43.779 --> 22:46.740
Maybe they'll cancel it,
but we have to show.

22:47.366 --> 22:50.160
...in the White House today and tomorrow.

22:52.913 --> 22:57.333
Though it is known
that they have lost their best...

22:57.418 --> 23:00.879
-Have you been drinking?
-The whole country's drinking,

23:01.005 --> 23:04.299
and not to celebrate
some spoiled brat's wedding.

23:04.800 --> 23:08.136
We are mourning together with his widow...

23:08.220 --> 23:11.097
-They'll never cancel. You know why?
-...with his children,

23:12.183 --> 23:15.894
-his parents, brothers and sisters.
-Because they're happy.

23:16.145 --> 23:18.897
You should've heard some of the things
people said yesterday.

23:18.981 --> 23:21.191
Like what? What did they say?

23:21.859 --> 23:25.070
"The man made a lot of enemies,"
things like that.

23:25.738 --> 23:30.283
That's awful. l don't care
what your politics are, this is America.

23:30.868 --> 23:33.369
You don't just shoot the president.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.455
Edwin Walker, who...

23:35.539 --> 23:38.750
Chet Huntley was talking about Jackie
and those kids

23:38.834 --> 23:40.376
and how she'd just lost that baby,

23:40.461 --> 23:44.130
and Harry Crane
was looking at his paperwork,

23:44.215 --> 23:46.800
calculating how many commercials
weren't going to be aired.

23:46.884 --> 23:49.552
...this prepared statement
be handed to newsmen...

23:49.637 --> 23:51.137
l'm not going.

23:51.639 --> 23:54.474
You can go and say l'm sick,
if you think it's that important.

23:54.558 --> 23:58.311
"...demonstrates the internal threat
that can never be underestimated."

23:58.395 --> 23:59.687
No, you're right.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.941
"Our sympathy for the Kennedy family
is no less than it is

24:03.025 --> 24:05.902
"for the millions of people
who have sustained equal losses

24:05.986 --> 24:10.240
"in the fight for freedom."
Then General Walker's statement went on...

24:13.953 --> 24:17.914
l got a call from Leona, this girl
l used to work with at the phone company.

24:17.998 --> 24:21.459
My friend Francine called me.
Don couldn't get through.

24:21.585 --> 24:24.087
Well, the system
was completely overloaded.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.756
lt's annoying that people think
the operators were watching TV.

24:26.841 --> 24:29.259
They were as frustrated as anyone.

24:29.468 --> 24:32.220
The maitre d' has reorganized the seating.

24:32.304 --> 24:36.015
If you are at an even-numbered table,
take these first six.

24:36.142 --> 24:39.310
If you are at an odd-numbered table,
the left side of the room.

24:39.395 --> 24:42.522
Maestro, do you mind? Thank you.

24:42.940 --> 24:46.651
Look, everybody, grab your plate
and come on up to the front here.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.361
Sit wherever you feel like,

24:48.445 --> 24:52.532
and please feel free to have
the prime rib and the fillet of sole.

24:52.741 --> 24:55.910
Help yourself.
I mean that. There are no waiters.

24:59.415 --> 25:02.250
Three months after Roosevelt died,
we bombed Hiroshima.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.252
That's how we got over it.

25:04.336 --> 25:09.174
l say we hang Lee Oswald, and then we
take care of Texas. Hell, the whole South.

25:11.427 --> 25:14.262
What did everyone think
of the sweetbreads?

25:14.763 --> 25:17.265
You were right, Mommy. Okay?

25:21.270 --> 25:23.271
-Problem solved.
-Hardly.

25:23.647 --> 25:27.525
-They just told me the cake's not coming.
-Shit.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.298
Of course.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.767
l have to say, on some level,
Harry has a point.

26:00.851 --> 26:04.562
l think he wanted attention.
He obviously didn't fit in.

26:05.439 --> 26:07.023
Congratulations.

26:07.149 --> 26:10.485
You are so beautiful,
like Natalie Wood or something.

26:10.986 --> 26:14.822
Daddy, l really wish
you could've gotten to see the ceremony.

26:15.157 --> 26:18.076
lt's okay. We understand.
We're honored you're here.

26:18.160 --> 26:21.788
-l heard the church was packed.
-Those weren't our guests.

26:22.456 --> 26:23.831
Have a seat.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.835
Just sit anywhere.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.546
l'm so happy for you.

26:36.679 --> 26:38.680
I would like some legal representation,

26:38.764 --> 26:42.392
but these police officers
have not allowed me to have any.

26:42.685 --> 26:45.186
I don't know what this is all about.

26:45.312 --> 26:47.105
-Did you kill the president?
-No, sir, I didn't.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.899
-People keep asking me that. Sir?
-Did you shoot the president?

26:49.984 --> 26:52.986
How would you know
that's what a monster looks like?

26:53.070 --> 26:55.822
Naturally, if I work in that building, yes, sir.

26:55.906 --> 26:58.324
Did you see The Times? He lived in Russia.

26:58.409 --> 27:01.369
-l thought he just visited.
-Would you visit?

27:02.204 --> 27:05.206
-I'm just a patsy.
-Did you shoot the president?

27:06.417 --> 27:11.045
-There you are. What are you doing here?
-They're about to interview Oswald.

27:11.380 --> 27:12.964
Hey, somebody go buy a cake.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.425
-Let's keep it quiet and we'll all get it!
-Hold it down.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.677
Has the gentleman been identified?

27:17.761 --> 27:19.846
Yes, sir, he's been identified
for killing the officer.

27:19.930 --> 27:22.724
l need you out there.
l'm about to give my toast.

27:22.808 --> 27:26.686
l've heard your toast a million times.
The president is dead.

27:26.937 --> 27:29.480
And l'll tell you something else,
our table has no one at it.

27:29.565 --> 27:31.566
l consolidated the tables.

27:32.776 --> 27:36.404
-Would you keep an eye on her?
-Absolutely.

27:41.952 --> 27:43.453
We better get back in there.

27:43.537 --> 27:45.330
-We want to say this...
-Jane.

27:45.414 --> 27:48.583
...that this investigation
has been carried on jointly by...

27:52.379 --> 27:55.006
This toast is going to be much shorter
than it was supposed to be.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.925
Obviously, we're all in a different mood.

27:59.428 --> 28:01.429
Can someone please
get my wife out of the kitchen?

28:01.513 --> 28:05.767
I have something very nice to say about her.
But while we're alone...

28:07.936 --> 28:10.938
I want to say something nice
about my ex-wife.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.900
Mona, you're a lioness.

28:15.444 --> 28:18.821
And thank you for resisting
the urge to eat your cub.

28:21.033 --> 28:23.368
This could've been an awful day,

28:23.619 --> 28:28.956
but here we are, not watching TV,
but together watching the two of you.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.878
To Margaret and Brooks Hargrove.

28:37.800 --> 28:40.718
The adults,
we all wanted to be strong for you,

28:40.803 --> 28:44.514
but your spirit, your love,
your hope is giving us strength.

28:46.141 --> 28:49.352
And I promise you now,
if you can make it through a day like today,

28:49.436 --> 28:51.312
marriage is a cakewalk.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.856
To many years of happiness.

28:53.941 --> 28:55.566
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

28:57.986 --> 29:01.989
We invite the father of the bride
and the bride to share the dance floor.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.699
Sorry about that.

29:07.871 --> 29:10.415
Now, if there are any other
fathers and daughters...

29:10.499 --> 29:13.626
You know what?
Everyone, please join them.

29:20.592 --> 29:24.512
-Do you want to dance?
-l don't know.

29:37.609 --> 29:41.446
-Want me to teach him how to dance?
-He's a great dancer.

29:46.410 --> 29:47.869
She's happy.

29:49.037 --> 29:52.915
That's because she doesn't know
his net worth just dropped by half.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.542
Stop it, Daddy.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.262
Hey.

30:10.267 --> 30:12.393
Everything's gonna be fine.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.938
How do you know that?

30:34.458 --> 30:35.833
You'll see.

30:48.222 --> 30:50.806
Why do you keep looking at that woman?

30:52.059 --> 30:54.143
What are you talking about?

31:21.630 --> 31:23.673
-Are you ready?
-Did Jennifer fall in?

31:23.757 --> 31:26.759
-She'll be right out.
-See you Tuesday.

31:39.147 --> 31:43.693
He was so handsome,
and now l'll never get to vote for him.

32:04.673 --> 32:05.715
Hey.

32:07.134 --> 32:09.927
You want me to cut you out of that dress?

32:15.058 --> 32:17.018
l'm making a phone call.

32:31.867 --> 32:34.619
-Hello?
-So what's new?

32:37.372 --> 32:40.082
-lt's incredible, isn't it?
-Yes.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.377
Margaret got married today.

32:43.879 --> 32:47.381
That's right, l forgot. Poor thing.

32:48.675 --> 32:53.512
Joanie, l wish you could've seen it.
Oh, my God, what a disaster.

32:53.722 --> 32:55.056
l'm sorry.

32:55.849 --> 32:59.518
She pulled through.
They pulled through. l pulled through.

33:04.232 --> 33:06.192
l can't believe how quiet it is out there.

33:06.276 --> 33:10.780
Not everywhere. Greg just called.
He's working the night shift at the ER.

33:12.574 --> 33:14.241
People are still getting sick.

33:14.326 --> 33:18.245
Car accidents are happening.
Babies are being born.

33:19.247 --> 33:23.000
Well, l'm glad he's not home.
l had to talk to you.

33:28.590 --> 33:30.883
Nobody else is saying
the right thing about this.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.219
My God, you're really upset.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.013
What's that about?

33:37.557 --> 33:40.226
Because there's nothing funny about this.

33:47.109 --> 33:50.111
Well, hang in there, red.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.113
You too.

33:54.616 --> 33:56.784
-Bye-bye.
-Goodbye.

34:05.460 --> 34:08.963
Put him on a standby
of indeterminate length, will you?

34:10.549 --> 34:12.591
Let me have it. I want it.

34:13.593 --> 34:16.429
Being led out by Captain Fritz.

34:17.347 --> 34:21.434
There is the prisoner. There is Lee Oswald.

34:23.854 --> 34:24.895
He's been shot.

34:24.980 --> 34:26.897
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-What happened?

34:26.982 --> 34:28.107
Lee Oswald has been shot.

34:28.191 --> 34:31.402
They shot him. The police were walking him
through the building

34:31.486 --> 34:34.238
-and some man ran up and shot him.
-What?

34:35.198 --> 34:36.574
Detectives have their guns drawn.

34:36.658 --> 34:39.410
-What is going on?
-Oswald has been shot.

34:40.537 --> 34:42.913
There is no question about it.
Oswald has been shot.

34:42.998 --> 34:45.750
-Please, leave me alone.
-Betts?

34:45.834 --> 34:48.794
...here in the basement
of Dallas police headquarters.

34:48.879 --> 34:50.379
What happened?

34:51.298 --> 34:54.759
-Do you know where he is at present?
-No, sir, I don't.

34:56.511 --> 35:00.139
-Can you give us some indication...
-Nothing. Go upstairs.

35:06.271 --> 35:08.647
The family, incidentally,
asked that there be no flowers,

35:08.732 --> 35:10.608
but there have, nevertheless, been flowers.

35:10.692 --> 35:13.819
People either didn't hear
or chose to ignore it,

35:13.945 --> 35:18.324
and one room or two rooms
in the White House have had to be set aside

35:20.494 --> 35:25.080
to hold them. The casket, incidentally,

35:25.248 --> 35:28.292
will remain closed at all times
during all ceremonies...

35:28.376 --> 35:29.877
l'm going out.

35:34.299 --> 35:36.133
-Where?
-For a drive.

35:37.844 --> 35:42.431
Let me drive. l'll get the kids.
We'll all go somewhere. That's a good idea.

35:42.557 --> 35:45.726
No. l need to clear my head.

35:46.061 --> 35:48.813
...airports, four of them around town...

36:16.758 --> 36:21.011
-l'm so glad you could see me.
-Where does your husband think you are?

36:21.888 --> 36:26.767
l don't care. He's been lying to me for years.
l couldn't be in that house.

36:29.938 --> 36:34.316
Then l saw you yesterday.
l didn't know you were going to be there.

36:36.319 --> 36:38.445
l hoped you would be there.

36:39.072 --> 36:43.909
Derby day, it seems like 1 00 years ago.

36:47.622 --> 36:51.125
And then this morning,
seeing that man shot to death...

36:53.545 --> 36:55.170
What is going on?

36:55.463 --> 36:59.925
lt will be okay. We've lost a lot of presidents
and we're still standing.

37:00.802 --> 37:05.306
l wish l could believe you.
l can't believe anything right now.

37:06.892 --> 37:10.144
Have you thought that
there are other ways to live?

37:12.731 --> 37:16.191
Listen. l'm not in love
with the tragedy of this thing.

37:17.110 --> 37:20.279
It's not Romeo and Juliet.
l want it to happen.

37:21.698 --> 37:23.574
l have three children.

37:23.867 --> 37:27.620
l'll know more when the primaries
start to shake out in spring,

37:27.704 --> 37:31.999
-but l can leave the campaign right now.
-l don't want you to do that.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.760
You don't have to answer me now,

37:43.845 --> 37:45.846
but l want to marry you.

37:50.602 --> 37:53.896
-l don't know what to say.
-You don't have to say anything.

37:53.980 --> 37:55.356
l told you.

37:56.191 --> 38:01.362
But if you search your heart,
you'll know that l can make you happy.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.092
l should go.

38:25.387 --> 38:28.472
l wish l could take you
to the movies right now,

38:29.391 --> 38:32.476
that some theater was playing
your favorite movie.

38:35.397 --> 38:37.147
Singin' in the Rain.

38:38.233 --> 38:41.318
Well, just think about that.

39:03.425 --> 39:08.595
This is made possible by special equipment,
and it will move at one-fourth speed.

39:08.930 --> 39:11.557
So we would like to show you
the slow motion of the shooting

39:11.641 --> 39:13.642
of Lee Harvey Oswald now.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.230
They just stood there.

39:18.356 --> 39:21.275
No security.
The most wanted man in America.

39:22.110 --> 39:25.571
Why even have a trial?
Just throw him over to the mob.

39:25.989 --> 39:30.325
Now you can see the two detectives,
one in a light suit, one in a dark,

39:30.910 --> 39:32.036
bringing Oswald out.

39:32.120 --> 39:35.456
The camera changes its lens
for a close-up of Oswald.

39:37.292 --> 39:40.544
The shot has been fired. You cannot hear it
in this version of the tape.

39:40.628 --> 39:42.546
Oswald falls.
The man with the hat moves in on him.

39:42.630 --> 39:45.007
He's grabbed by the man in light.

39:46.676 --> 39:50.262
-You're not going into work tomorrow?
-No, of course not.

39:50.764 --> 39:54.767
-lt's a national day of mourning.
-You're going to go in Tuesday.

39:56.269 --> 39:58.479
There's another happy thought.

40:00.315 --> 40:04.651
Those people don't care about you.
And honestly, what's the difference?

40:04.903 --> 40:06.653
What are you saying?

40:07.614 --> 40:11.492
You did everything they asked you to do,
but you don't owe them anything.

40:11.576 --> 40:14.953
...minutes past 2:00 Eastern Standard Time,
we were advised

40:15.038 --> 40:19.666
that Lee Harvey Oswald was dead.
Now Ruby is under arrest...

40:20.210 --> 40:24.838
You should start gathering your clients.
They'll follow you wherever you go.

40:25.423 --> 40:27.841
...is the operator of two nightclubs
in Dallas...

40:29.427 --> 40:32.971
The only other president buried there
is William Howard Taft,

40:33.056 --> 40:37.476
though, of course, there are many
other heroes of perhaps lesser renown.

40:37.769 --> 40:41.271
That is the Lee... Robert E. Lee Mansion.

40:41.523 --> 40:46.360
Its name, Arlington, has been given
to the cemetery and, in fact, to the county.

40:46.528 --> 40:49.113
-Francine has the kids.
-The president's brother, Robert Kennedy,

40:49.197 --> 40:51.907
and the Secretary of Defense,
Robert McNamara...

40:51.991 --> 40:55.119
-l don't know where to begin.
-What?

40:59.374 --> 41:04.586
l want to scream at you
for ruining all of this.

41:08.424 --> 41:13.220
But then you try to fix it
and there's no point.

41:15.598 --> 41:17.474
There's no point, Don.

41:22.397 --> 41:24.731
You're very upset. l understand.

41:27.485 --> 41:31.071
l know it's painful, but it's going to pass.

41:34.075 --> 41:37.119
-l don't love you.
-Betts, don't.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.665
-You're distraught.
-That's true,

41:43.084 --> 41:45.294
but l don't love you anymore.

41:47.964 --> 41:49.882
-l know that.
-Stop it.

41:50.758 --> 41:54.178
-l kissed you yesterday.
-Kennedy's remains...

41:54.262 --> 41:56.138
l didn't feel a thing.

41:56.764 --> 42:00.434
...the public allowed to pass through
and pay its respects.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.811
There will be a little roped...

42:02.896 --> 42:05.606
You'll feel better tomorrow. You'll see.

42:06.941 --> 42:09.359
You can't even hear me right now.

42:09.944 --> 42:11.445
You're right.

42:13.489 --> 42:15.824
...on Monday it will be taken

42:15.909 --> 42:20.621
to the St. Matthew's Cathedral, which is on
Rhode Island Avenue in Washington,

42:21.289 --> 42:22.915
for the funeral.

42:25.376 --> 42:29.755
This, I think, is the largest
Catholic cathedral in town.

42:29.839 --> 42:32.341
It is, as you see, draped in black.

42:32.675 --> 42:36.428
It's been open all day.
Great numbers of people have stopped...

43:31.359 --> 43:33.360
-Morning.
-Morning, Daddy.

43:33.444 --> 43:34.903
Good morning.

43:39.701 --> 43:43.161
-Where are you going?
-l have to go to work. l'm sorry.

43:43.496 --> 43:46.164
-lt's cold outside.
-l'm fine.

44:17.363 --> 44:18.530
Peggy.

44:24.245 --> 44:26.246
What are you doing here?

44:27.206 --> 44:29.082
l don't know. Aqua Net.

44:38.217 --> 44:41.011
lt doesn't shoot till after Thanksgiving.

44:42.597 --> 44:44.097
We'll be okay.

44:52.857 --> 44:54.483
What do you have?

44:54.609 --> 44:57.652
-What are you doing here?
-The bars are closed.

45:00.281 --> 45:03.825
My roommate invited over half the building
so they could watch TV

45:03.910 --> 45:06.620
and write condolence letters to Jackie.

45:07.455 --> 45:10.665
Then l went to my sister's
and my mother was crying

45:10.750 --> 45:12.501
and praying so hard.

45:13.336 --> 45:16.630
There wasn't room
for anyone else to feel anything.

45:20.468 --> 45:22.719
The funeral's already started.

45:23.346 --> 45:26.807
l was going to watch in Cooper's office.
ls that okay?

45:28.059 --> 45:29.142
Yes.

45:36.192 --> 45:37.734
Are you coming?
