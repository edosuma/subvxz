Our costume designer
would constantly be texting me

1:01:11.458 --> 1:01:13.583
pictures
from the Wawa convenience store,

1:01:13.667 --> 1:01:15.417
just of people in the line.

1:01:15.750 --> 1:01:18.709
JULIANNE NICHOLSON:
The clothes really all felt
lived in to me

1:01:18.792 --> 1:01:20.875
and of that place.
For instance,

1:01:20.959 --> 1:01:24.125
I mean, I had, I think,
a Dave Matthews concert T-shirt

1:01:24.208 --> 1:01:27.375
and certain things that maybe
you won't even see on camera,

1:01:27.458 --> 1:01:29.208
but those little details
for her

1:01:29.291 --> 1:01:31.750
and the actors are important.

1:01:33.166 --> 1:01:35.500
I wanted the show to have
a grittiness to it

1:01:35.583 --> 1:01:38.625
and have an honesty to it,
to have a realness to it.

1:01:39.417 --> 1:01:41.125
These are people that get up
every morning

1:01:41.208 --> 1:01:43.750
and go to jobs that don't
necessarily love,

1:01:43.834 --> 1:01:46.542
but yeah, they do it
out of a sense of duty.

1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.667
So, I wanted to portray
these communities that exist

1:01:49.750 --> 1:01:52.458
that don't often get any time
on the screen in a way

1:01:52.542 --> 1:01:55.542
that was heroic and noble
and also really sympathetic.

1:01:55.625 --> 1:01:57.583
MARE SHEEHAN: We're asking
parents if their child

1:01:57.667 --> 1:02:00.041
might have seen something'.
Please come forward.

1:02:00.959 --> 1:02:03.208
Every bit of information
helps at this point.

1:02:04.500 --> 1:02:06.083
GUY PEARCE: What's beautiful
about this story

1:02:06.166 --> 1:02:07.417
is that it isn't
just about the crime,

1:02:07.500 --> 1:02:09.500
it isn't just about the mystery
and who's done it,

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:11.291
but it's about the families.

1:02:11.667 --> 1:02:13.750
You have the opportunity
to sort of investigate

1:02:13.834 --> 1:02:15.667
all the families
and see the effects

1:02:15.750 --> 1:02:17.500
that the crime has had
and get involved

1:02:17.583 --> 1:02:20.667
in everybody's personal stories
and see how they're interwoven.

1:02:21.917 --> 1:02:24.625
So, there's something
kind of heightened, you know,

1:02:24.709 --> 1:02:27.333
in the drama, I suppose,
when it is a small town.

1:02:27.917 --> 1:02:29.500
You're pushin' everyone away.

1:02:32.333 --> 1:02:33.375
Including you?

1:02:33.709 --> 1:02:35.166
No, I won't let you.

1:02:36.792 --> 1:02:40.333
WINSLET: The show is very much
about compassion and mercy

1:02:40.417 --> 1:02:43.458
and looking out for your friends
and your neighbors,

1:02:43.542 --> 1:02:45.458
and it's quite special
in that regard,

1:02:45.542 --> 1:02:47.208
very moving in that regard.
