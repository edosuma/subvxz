in the original?

21:24.400 --> 21:25.840
Bosnian.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.800
So maybe the saban pitch
is older than we think.

21:27.824 --> 21:29.760
Maybe it's from the
yugoslavian war in the 1990s.

38:13.440 --> 38:15.640
Good.

38:15.720 --> 38:18.320
Um...

38:18.400 --> 38:22.640
The toy elephant
that bea lost, Lilly...

38:22.720 --> 38:24.800
We've already replaced it.

38:24.880 --> 38:25.880
Oh, have you?
Yeah.

38:25.920 --> 38:27.720
Ah, good.

38:27.800 --> 38:28.880
Good. Ok.

38:28.960 --> 38:33.520
I was just...
I, uh...

38:33.600 --> 38:36.480
This belonged
to my son.

38:36.560 --> 38:40.680
And, um, I just
thought, but...

38:40.760 --> 38:44.840
So we're eating.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.960
Sure, ok.

38:47.040 --> 38:50.640
Um, Adam.

38:50.720 --> 38:52.560
My son's name.
Adam.

38:52.640 --> 38:54.360
Right.

38:54.440 --> 38:56.360
Ok.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.000
[Sea gulls squawking]

39:18.800 --> 39:20.600
Ok.

39:45.960 --> 39:48.160
[Click]

40:14.840 --> 40:16.520
[Gasps]

40:40.800 --> 40:42.960
[Horn honks, distant alarms]

41:10.520 --> 41:12.640
Mr. Moreau.

42:09.720 --> 42:11.720
[Door closes]

42:18.920 --> 42:21.240
Bb: So there was
a census in 1991,

42:21.320 --> 42:23.880
but there's no mention
of any saban khasanovic.

42:23.960 --> 42:26.000
We think that
he wasn't born yet.

42:26.080 --> 42:29.920
All right, maybe.
Show the map, please.

42:34.120 --> 42:35.720
There you are.

42:49.720 --> 42:51.320
Excuse my French.

43:56.320 --> 43:58.960
What have you
got there?

43:59.040 --> 44:03.080
It's a database
of all the people who died

44:03.160 --> 44:06.040
during the war in Bosnia.

44:06.120 --> 44:08.880
It is called the Bosnian
book of the dead.

44:08.960 --> 44:12.000
If saban khasanovic or his
parents died in the conflict,

44:12.080 --> 44:13.920
it might be in there.

44:17.120 --> 44:18.560
Nope.

44:37.560 --> 44:39.720
[Women singing
indistinctly]

45:15.280 --> 45:16.680
What are you doing here?

45:16.760 --> 45:18.840
You know how I love
an all-nighter.

45:19.920 --> 45:21.080
Go on.

45:21.160 --> 45:22.600
What?

45:22.680 --> 45:23.680
Take a break.

45:23.760 --> 45:25.760
I'm all right.

45:32.400 --> 45:35.760
Terry heaney tested
positive for scopolamine.

45:38.040 --> 45:40.880
No wonder he was
compliant.

45:42.920 --> 45:45.640
[Women singing
indistinctly]

46:06.800 --> 46:09.720
Marco khasanovic
was killed in

46:09.800 --> 46:12.200
a sniper attack
in August 1994.

46:12.280 --> 46:15.200
[Karl sighs]

46:15.280 --> 46:20.600
So... whoever wants us to find
saban, it's not his father.

46:20.680 --> 46:25.720
Well, we haven't found his
mother amongst the dead yet.

46:25.800 --> 46:28.600
[Song continues]

46:44.480 --> 46:46.560
[Screaming]
