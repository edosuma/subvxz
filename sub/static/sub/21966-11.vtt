00:03.500 --> 00:06.667
Oh, yes.

00:06.709 --> 00:09.959
Another warm day

00:06.709 --> 00:09.959
in the dead of winter. Mm.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.500
Really thins my fluids.

00:11.542 --> 00:14.166
( bird chirping )

00:11.542 --> 00:14.166
Hello, bird of the air.

00:14.208 --> 00:17.417
Getting some sun too, I see.

00:17.458 --> 00:18.875
( yells )

00:20.875 --> 00:23.834
Someone's unleashed

00:20.875 --> 00:23.834
a Weather Machine!

00:23.875 --> 00:26.166
Snow!

00:26.208 --> 00:28.875
After a week of clear skies.

00:30.417 --> 00:33.625
Cody, see if Doc Greene's

00:30.417 --> 00:33.625
been tinkering again.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.291
And I'll alert the Chief in case

00:33.667 --> 00:36.291
Doctor Morocco has returned--

00:36.333 --> 00:38.542
CODY:

00:36.333 --> 00:38.542
No, no, wait.

00:38.583 --> 00:41.417
Ha, ha. That's not

00:38.583 --> 00:41.417
from a Weather Machine.

00:41.458 --> 00:44.500
Mr. Hooton's just decorating

00:41.458 --> 00:44.500
for the holiday.

00:44.542 --> 00:45.834
This isn't Christmas.

00:47.458 --> 00:49.166
But next week

00:47.458 --> 00:49.166
is Midwinter Morning.

00:49.208 --> 00:52.041
BLADES:

00:49.208 --> 00:52.041
How many holidays

00:49.208 --> 00:52.041
do you humans have?

00:52.083 --> 00:54.709
This one's special.

00:52.083 --> 00:54.709
It's just for Griffin Rock.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.458
It all started back when--

00:56.500 --> 00:58.333
( alarm bell ringing )

00:59.917 --> 01:03.083
Rescue Bots. A stack of logs

00:59.917 --> 01:03.083
just rolled onto a car.

01:03.125 --> 01:04.542
Someone's trapped

01:03.125 --> 01:04.542
inside.

01:04.583 --> 01:07.542

GRAHAM:

01:22.041 --> 01:23.542
Stop!

01:23.583 --> 01:25.583
We have to remove the logs

01:23.583 --> 01:25.583
in the right order,

01:25.625 --> 01:28.458
or they could shift

01:25.625 --> 01:28.458
too much weight onto the car.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.166

Just remain calm,

02:23.583 --> 02:25.250
Mrs. Neederlander.

02:25.291 --> 02:26.500
(  cat meows  )

02:26.542 --> 02:28.625
And, uh, you too, Mr. Pettypaws.

02:28.667 --> 02:30.709
Dani, any way to speed this up?

02:30.750 --> 02:33.083
Not safely.

02:33.125 --> 02:36.875
Ugh, I'm about to toss

02:33.125 --> 02:36.875
my waffles as it is.

02:36.917 --> 02:38.291
Toss your...?

02:38.333 --> 02:40.583
Oh! Your breakfast.

02:40.625 --> 02:42.875
Ugh.

02:45.667 --> 02:47.542
( grunts )

02:47.583 --> 02:50.875
Wanna tell me why there's

02:47.583 --> 02:50.875
a stack of logs downtown?

02:50.917 --> 02:53.500
A bonfire

02:50.917 --> 02:53.500
for Midwinter Morning.

02:53.542 --> 02:54.917
I don't know why we bother,

02:54.959 --> 02:57.000
hardly anyone shows up

02:54.959 --> 02:57.000
for it anymore.

02:57.041 --> 02:59.875
Doesn't a bonfire

02:57.041 --> 02:59.875
leave a big mess?

02:59.917 --> 03:03.250
Yep. Guess who

02:59.917 --> 03:03.250
cleans that up.

03:06.333 --> 03:08.208
( grunts )

03:17.041 --> 03:18.834
( grunts )

03:18.875 --> 03:20.583
You are safe now.

03:20.625 --> 03:23.375
How can I drive,

03:20.625 --> 03:23.375
you reckless robots?

03:23.417 --> 03:26.041
You tore the door off.

03:26.083 --> 03:28.125
KADE: Now hold on there.

03:26.083 --> 03:28.125
We took great care to--

03:28.166 --> 03:30.542
A little thank you would be--

03:28.166 --> 03:30.542
CODY: Please don't be upset.

03:30.583 --> 03:32.542
Uh, let me handle this.

03:32.583 --> 03:34.834
Mrs. Neederlander,

03:32.583 --> 03:34.834
now, our objective

03:34.875 --> 03:36.542
was to free you

03:34.875 --> 03:36.542
from the vehicle.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.041
Sometimes when we do that--

03:38.083 --> 03:39.750
This wouldn't have happened

03:38.083 --> 03:39.750
if that log pile

03:39.792 --> 03:41.417
wasn't such a hazard.

03:41.458 --> 03:44.291
Why even have a bonfire

03:41.458 --> 03:44.291
if nobody comes?

03:44.333 --> 03:45.917
We come.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.208
All right,

03:45.959 --> 03:48.208
how about if I give you

03:48.250 --> 03:50.208
and Mr. Pettypaws

03:48.250 --> 03:50.208
a lift home?

03:50.250 --> 03:52.291
Fine. Take me to my cabin.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.166
The one

03:52.333 --> 03:54.166
on the mountain?

03:54.208 --> 03:57.875
That's where I stay every year

03:54.208 --> 03:57.875
during this holiday charade.

03:57.917 --> 04:00.750
Well, after you.

04:03.083 --> 04:05.417
The last time I transported

04:03.083 --> 04:05.417
Mr. Pettypaws,

04:05.458 --> 04:08.041
he left me an odorous

04:05.458 --> 04:08.041
little parting gift.

04:08.083 --> 04:11.375
I remember. Had to drive with

04:08.083 --> 04:11.375
your windows down for a week.

04:11.417 --> 04:16.166
Young man, use that noisy

04:11.417 --> 04:16.166
tractor of yours to tow my car.

04:18.166 --> 04:20.083
I'm noisy?

04:20.125 --> 04:22.417
Uh, yes, ma'am.

04:25.834 --> 04:28.792
You're welcome!

04:30.667 --> 04:34.041
Maybe that old grump should

04:30.667 --> 04:34.041
call someone else next time.

04:35.458 --> 04:38.333
And she can get her own cat

04:35.458 --> 04:38.333
out of the tree too.

04:38.375 --> 04:41.333
A shame she has to be

04:38.375 --> 04:41.333
so ungrateful.

04:41.375 --> 04:43.375
Wonder why she doesn't

04:41.375 --> 04:43.375
like this holiday.

04:43.417 --> 04:46.083
Yeah, what could she have

04:43.417 --> 04:46.083
against getting presents?

04:46.125 --> 04:48.417
By the way,

04:46.125 --> 04:48.417
what'd you guys get me?

04:48.458 --> 04:50.041
Like I'd tell you.

04:50.083 --> 04:52.917
And like I'd remember.

04:50.083 --> 04:52.917
I clicked, I bought.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.417
It'll be here on the ferry.

04:54.458 --> 04:56.834
Were we supposed to buy

04:54.458 --> 04:56.834
presents?

04:56.875 --> 04:58.375
That's the way

04:56.875 --> 04:58.375
it works.

04:58.417 --> 05:00.166
I need a few things,

04:58.417 --> 05:00.166
so I'll give you a list.

05:00.208 --> 05:02.542
Presents cost money,

05:00.208 --> 05:02.542
right?

05:02.583 --> 05:05.625
Where do we get money?

05:02.583 --> 05:05.625
( Heatwave groans )

05:05.667 --> 05:07.000
Someone want to explain

05:07.041 --> 05:11.125
what this Midwinter fuss

05:07.041 --> 05:11.125
is all about?

05:11.166 --> 05:13.750
CODY:

05:11.166 --> 05:13.750
"'Twas a winter storm

05:11.166 --> 05:13.750
like no other.

05:13.792 --> 05:17.917
"The Great Nor'easter of 1713.

05:17.959 --> 05:20.583
"Snow and ice had buried

05:20.625 --> 05:23.792
"trapping the island's residents

05:20.625 --> 05:23.792
in their homes.

"Supply ships

05:23.834 --> 05:26.375

who this benefactor was.

05:43.625 --> 05:47.041
he became known as...

05:47.083 --> 05:50.917
the Rider of Midwinter."

05:50.959 --> 05:53.709
Clearly this Rider

05:50.959 --> 05:53.709
kept his identity a secret

05:53.750 --> 05:56.458
for fear of being arrested

05:53.750 --> 05:56.458
as a trespasser.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.875
So people give presents now

05:58.125 --> 06:00.875
as a way of honoring

06:00.917 --> 06:03.208
the mysterious Rider

06:00.917 --> 06:03.208
who saved the town?

06:03.250 --> 06:05.417
Right.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.417
And the cool part is

06:05.458 --> 06:07.917
everyone still finds bread

06:05.458 --> 06:07.917
on their doorstep

06:07.959 --> 06:09.542
every Midwinter Morning.

06:09.583 --> 06:11.625
A 300-year-old Rider?

06:11.667 --> 06:15.041
I'm sorry,

06:11.667 --> 06:15.041
but I would not eat that bread.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.041
Ha. No, Blades.

06:17.083 --> 06:19.417
It's someone else carrying on

06:17.083 --> 06:19.417
the tradition.

06:19.458 --> 06:21.083
But nobody knows who.

06:21.125 --> 06:24.542
So what's a bonfire

06:21.125 --> 06:24.542
have to do with any of this?

06:24.583 --> 06:26.834
After the blizzard,

06:24.583 --> 06:26.834
everyone gathered in town

06:26.875 --> 06:29.792
and lit a fire to keep warm.

06:26.875 --> 06:29.792
It just grew from that.

06:29.834 --> 06:33.375
Ugh. Hate to break it

06:29.834 --> 06:33.375
to you, Chase,

06:33.417 --> 06:36.375
but that air freshener?

06:33.417 --> 06:36.375
So not cutting it.

06:36.417 --> 06:38.834
Curse you, Mr. Pettypaws.

06:38.875 --> 06:41.333
CHIEF ( over PA ):

06:38.875 --> 06:41.333
Everyone to the garage, please.

06:41.375 --> 06:43.917
Winter storm.

06:43.959 --> 06:47.625
As if this holiday

06:43.959 --> 06:47.625
doesn't keep us busy enough.

06:50.834 --> 06:53.750
Well, at least the town won't

06:50.834 --> 06:53.750
need to decorate with fake snow.

06:53.792 --> 06:56.375
Isn't this just wonderful?

06:56.417 --> 06:59.834
Snow on the roads seriously

06:56.417 --> 06:59.834
complicates the rescues.

06:59.875 --> 07:01.792
Aw, I think

06:59.875 --> 07:01.792
it's beautiful.

07:01.834 --> 07:06.959
Me too.

07:01.834 --> 07:06.959
I hope it snows all week.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.792
It's been snowing all week!

07:09.834 --> 07:11.834
Conditions are so bad

07:11.875 --> 07:14.291
that nobody has even been out

07:11.875 --> 07:14.291
gift shopping.

07:14.333 --> 07:16.709
And for those of us

07:14.333 --> 07:16.709
who ordered online,

07:16.750 --> 07:20.709
the ferry carrying our packages

07:16.750 --> 07:20.709
has not arrived.

07:20.750 --> 07:23.917
Which means neither has

07:20.750 --> 07:23.917
the Gourmet Hot Chocolate Maker

07:23.959 --> 07:25.834
I bought for myself.

07:25.875 --> 07:27.750
I want my cocoa.

08:15.166 --> 08:18.667
Being only a land-based vehicle

08:15.166 --> 08:18.667
sure can be frustrating.

08:18.709 --> 08:21.625
I too feel revved up

08:18.709 --> 08:21.625
with nowhere to go.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.250
Don't worry. Blades and Heatwave

08:21.667 --> 08:24.250
will get it done.

follow our searchlight.

Unh!

08:51.792 --> 08:55.917
He made it! But that shipping

08:51.792 --> 08:55.917
container didn't.

08:55.959 --> 08:58.208
What?

09:01.333 --> 09:02.959
No!

09:03.000 --> 09:05.208
( feedback over earphones )

09:03.000 --> 09:05.208
Everything all right?

09:05.250 --> 09:08.834
CODY:

09:05.250 --> 09:08.834
Mario's safe, Dad. But the

09:05.250 --> 09:08.834
container of packages was lost.

09:08.875 --> 09:11.375
Ah. Understood.

09:11.417 --> 09:15.625
Hopefully the rest of the town

09:11.417 --> 09:15.625
takes the news better than that.

09:15.667 --> 09:18.667
This is catastrophic!

09:18.709 --> 09:21.125
No presents

09:18.709 --> 09:21.125
on Midwinter Morning?

09:21.166 --> 09:24.750
Oh, the humanity.

09:28.125 --> 09:32.000
My gifts were on that ferry.

09:32.041 --> 09:33.583
( gulps )

09:33.625 --> 09:34.875
Oh.

09:34.917 --> 09:37.125
(  light dramatic theme playing  )

09:51.166 --> 09:53.959
Please tell me somebody

09:51.166 --> 09:53.959
bought gifts locally.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.917
Sorry, Dani. We ordered them

09:54.000 --> 09:56.917
online like most people.

09:56.959 --> 09:59.500
Maybe we could still go

09:56.959 --> 09:59.500
buy some gifts downtown.

09:59.542 --> 10:02.709
Except that stores have been

09:59.542 --> 10:02.709
closed since the snow started.

10:02.750 --> 10:05.417
No one should be out

10:02.750 --> 10:05.417
in this weather, anyway.

10:05.458 --> 10:08.834
It is nearly impossible to drive

10:05.458 --> 10:08.834
responsibly in these conditions.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.667
BLADES:

10:08.875 --> 10:10.667
Try flying.

10:10.709 --> 10:13.917
I have no feeling

10:10.709 --> 10:13.917
in my tail rotor.

10:13.959 --> 10:18.500
Oh, face it. This holiday's

10:13.959 --> 10:18.500
an even bigger bust than usual.

10:18.542 --> 10:21.041
(  melancholic theme playing  )

10:24.291 --> 10:28.000
Are you upset because your gifts

10:24.291 --> 10:28.000
were lost at sea, Cody?

10:28.041 --> 10:31.542
A little. I ordered some pretty

10:28.041 --> 10:31.542
neat presents for my family.

10:31.583 --> 10:33.542
And for you guys too.

10:33.583 --> 10:36.875
But mostly I'm sad we won't be

10:33.583 --> 10:36.875
getting the bread tomorrow.

10:36.917 --> 10:39.208
Whoever the Rider

10:36.917 --> 10:39.208
of Midwinter is,

10:39.250 --> 10:41.959
he won't be able to make

10:39.250 --> 10:41.959
deliveries in this snow.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.208
Why not just consume the bread

10:42.000 --> 10:45.208
from your own kitchen?

10:45.250 --> 10:47.333
It's not really

10:45.250 --> 10:47.333
about the bread.

10:47.375 --> 10:50.041
But you just said--

10:50.083 --> 10:52.750
It's about the tradition.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.750
Being with family,

10:52.792 --> 10:54.417
finding bread

10:52.792 --> 10:54.417
on your doorstep...

10:54.458 --> 10:57.375
it all just gives you

10:54.458 --> 10:57.375
a warm feeling inside.

10:57.417 --> 11:00.750
Right.

10:57.417 --> 11:00.750
Because the bread is hot.

11:00.792 --> 11:02.583
Um, no.

11:02.625 --> 11:05.625
He means like

11:02.625 --> 11:05.625
internal combustion.

11:05.667 --> 11:08.959
Maybe I'm not being clear.

11:05.667 --> 11:08.959
BOULDER: I get it.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.333
The bread reminds everyone

11:10.375 --> 11:12.083
why they celebrate

11:10.375 --> 11:12.083
in the first place.

11:12.125 --> 11:15.083
Surviving the storm

11:12.125 --> 11:15.083
and being grateful for it.

11:15.125 --> 11:18.959
Exactly. Except nobody in town

11:15.125 --> 11:18.959
probably even cares anymore.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.125
They just want presents.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.125
( phone ringing )

11:24.000 --> 11:25.583
Griffin Rock Emergency.

11:25.625 --> 11:27.250
Uh, Mrs. Neederlander...

11:27.291 --> 11:30.750
( all groan )

11:30.792 --> 11:33.667
You need us all

11:30.792 --> 11:33.667
up at your cabin?

11:33.709 --> 11:37.125
( all groan loudly )

11:33.709 --> 11:37.125
Oh, Neederlander.

11:37.166 --> 11:39.208
What exactly is the emergency?

11:37.166 --> 11:39.208
(  line beeping  )

11:39.250 --> 11:41.834
Hello? Mrs. Neederlander?

11:41.875 --> 11:44.583
Hello? Lost the connection.

11:44.625 --> 11:46.542
Oh, we'd better get up there.

11:46.583 --> 11:48.000
You can't be serious.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.500
Hello,

11:48.041 --> 11:49.500
she's on the mountain.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.166
Can we wait until spring?

11:51.208 --> 11:52.959
I just hope Mr. Pettypaws

11:51.208 --> 11:52.959
does not need a ride.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.875
Why give her another reason

11:53.000 --> 11:54.875
to complain about us?

11:54.917 --> 11:56.542
If she just showed

11:54.917 --> 11:56.542
a little appreciation.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.959
But what if she really

11:56.583 --> 11:58.959
does need us?

11:59.000 --> 12:03.458
Cody's right. This is the job

11:59.000 --> 12:03.458
we all signed on for.

12:03.500 --> 12:07.000
Ugh. Agreed.

12:03.500 --> 12:07.000
How do we get up there?

12:07.041 --> 12:08.834
The mountain roads

12:07.041 --> 12:08.834
are iced over.

12:08.875 --> 12:12.250
And the upslope winds

12:08.875 --> 12:12.250
are too severe for flying.

12:12.291 --> 12:14.667
Boulder might be able

12:12.291 --> 12:14.667
to make it.

12:14.709 --> 12:17.000
She said she needed

12:14.709 --> 12:17.000
all of us.

12:17.041 --> 12:19.583
I have an idea.

12:25.208 --> 12:27.208
CHIEF:

12:25.208 --> 12:27.208
Good thinking, Cody.

12:27.250 --> 12:31.041
The MHQ is heavy enough,

12:27.250 --> 12:31.041
ice shouldn't be a problem.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.917
Dad, phones are still out.

12:32.959 --> 12:35.083
I hope Mrs. Neederlander

12:32.959 --> 12:35.083
is all right.

12:35.125 --> 12:36.875
Just don't be disappointed

12:35.125 --> 12:36.875
with her

12:36.917 --> 12:38.625
when this turns out

12:36.917 --> 12:38.625
to be nothing.

12:38.667 --> 12:40.250
I don't think

12:38.667 --> 12:40.250
she'd bring us all up there

12:40.291 --> 12:41.709
unless it was important.

12:41.750 --> 12:43.917
One would hope.

12:43.959 --> 12:47.166
(  dramatic theme playing  )

12:51.166 --> 12:52.792
Avalanche! Hang on!

13:01.250 --> 13:03.750
(  dramatic theme playing  )

13:07.625 --> 13:10.166
( all gasp )

13:18.834 --> 13:20.542
( gasps )

13:20.583 --> 13:22.542
Wow.

13:22.583 --> 13:24.417
Everyone okay?

13:24.458 --> 13:25.917
( all chatter )

13:25.959 --> 13:27.959
KADE: I guess.

13:25.959 --> 13:27.959
Relative to what?

13:28.000 --> 13:30.792
Though I do suggest we proceed

13:28.000 --> 13:30.792
on foot from here.

13:30.834 --> 13:32.875
Agreed.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.750
Mrs. Neederlander, what can--

13:45.792 --> 13:48.041
Get in here before you

13:45.792 --> 13:48.041
let all the heat out.

13:52.417 --> 13:54.875
Ah, she looks fine to me.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.959
Hmm. No cats in trees, either.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.166
Let's try to listen in.

14:03.333 --> 14:05.792
I am rather conflicted

14:03.333 --> 14:05.792
about eavesdropping.

14:05.834 --> 14:08.291
Think of it

14:05.834 --> 14:08.291
as covert surveillance.

14:08.333 --> 14:11.250
That works.

14:11.291 --> 14:14.458
Now, if you could tell us

14:11.291 --> 14:14.458
what the emergency is, Mrs.--

14:14.500 --> 14:17.875
I need someone to deliver

14:14.500 --> 14:17.875
my Midwinter Morning packages.

14:19.166 --> 14:22.750
I-- We all just-- You-- Mm.

14:22.792 --> 14:25.000
You brought us

14:22.792 --> 14:25.000
all the way up here

14:25.041 --> 14:27.750
during the worst

14:25.041 --> 14:27.750
Nor'easter in 300 years?

14:27.792 --> 14:29.583
So we can run your errands?

14:29.625 --> 14:32.583
It's the least you can do after

14:29.625 --> 14:32.583
your robots wrecked my car.

14:32.625 --> 14:34.500
( all gasp )

14:34.542 --> 14:37.000
Let me tell you something--

14:34.542 --> 14:37.000
( clears throat )

14:37.041 --> 14:40.291
( sniffing )

14:40.333 --> 14:42.792
( fire crackling )

14:42.834 --> 14:45.792
Mrs. Neederlander, what makes

14:42.834 --> 14:45.792
the delivery of these packages

14:45.834 --> 14:47.250
an emergency?

14:47.291 --> 14:50.083
They're important

14:47.291 --> 14:50.083
to the whole community.

14:50.125 --> 14:52.208
I hardly think--

14:50.125 --> 14:52.208
CODY: Dad, she's right.

14:52.250 --> 14:54.250
They are important.

14:54.291 --> 14:57.583
Mrs. Neederlander

14:54.291 --> 14:57.583
is the Rider of Midwinter.

14:57.625 --> 15:00.375
( all gasp )

15:00.417 --> 15:02.083
How old are you?

15:02.125 --> 15:04.667
I'm not the original,

15:02.125 --> 15:04.667
you knucklehead.

15:04.709 --> 15:07.542
Before me,

15:04.709 --> 15:07.542
it was Old Man Delgado.

15:07.583 --> 15:10.250
Before him, Mrs. Crabtree.

15:10.291 --> 15:13.250
But why do you do it?

15:10.291 --> 15:13.250
This holiday began

15:13.291 --> 15:16.083
because of one selfless act

15:13.291 --> 15:16.083
of kindness.

15:16.125 --> 15:18.709
Every year, it gets

15:16.125 --> 15:18.709
a little harder for people

15:18.750 --> 15:22.208
to remember that. I do it

15:18.750 --> 15:22.208
so they won't forget.

15:22.250 --> 15:24.917
That's a very good reason.

15:24.959 --> 15:27.583
And for the last 49 years,

15:27.625 --> 15:30.208
I've never missed

15:27.625 --> 15:30.208
a Midwinter Morning.

15:30.250 --> 15:32.750
And you're not gonna miss

15:30.250 --> 15:32.750
this one, either.

15:32.792 --> 15:34.583
Not if we can help it.

15:34.625 --> 15:37.041
We'll have to move fast.

15:34.625 --> 15:37.041
It'll be morning in a few hours.

15:37.083 --> 15:39.625
We need some big bags.

15:37.083 --> 15:39.625
Have any sheets we can use?

15:39.667 --> 15:43.083
Plenty. Now enough chitchat,

15:39.667 --> 15:43.083
let's move it, people!

15:43.125 --> 15:46.375
Wow. Who knew cranky

15:43.125 --> 15:46.375
Mrs. Neederlander

15:46.417 --> 15:48.000
had a heart of gold?

15:48.041 --> 15:50.000
( sniffling ):

15:48.041 --> 15:50.000
Not me. Ahem.

15:50.041 --> 15:52.166
I must be coming down

15:50.041 --> 15:52.166
with something.

15:52.208 --> 15:55.000
( sniffling ):

15:52.208 --> 15:55.000
Me too.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.542
Even though we don't get sick.

15:57.583 --> 15:59.917
Okay, robots.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.375
Looks like we have

15:59.959 --> 16:02.375
deliveries to make.

16:02.417 --> 16:05.333
(  soft theme playing  )

16:12.125 --> 16:15.834

16:12.125 --> 16:15.834

Looks like we barely made it.

18:21.500 --> 18:24.291
It also looks like

18:21.500 --> 18:24.291
Mrs. Neederlander miscounted.

18:24.333 --> 18:25.709
There's one left.

18:25.750 --> 18:29.083
She counted right.

18:25.750 --> 18:29.083
That one's ours.

18:29.125 --> 18:30.542
Wow.

18:30.583 --> 18:33.000
I guess I wasn't expecting

18:30.583 --> 18:33.000
anything.

18:33.041 --> 18:34.542
That makes it kind of nice.

18:34.583 --> 18:36.542
I imagine that's just

18:34.583 --> 18:36.542
how everyone felt

18:36.583 --> 18:39.959
on the first

18:36.583 --> 18:39.959
Midwinter Morning.

18:42.417 --> 18:44.250
Mmm.

18:42.417 --> 18:44.250
DANI: Oh, nice.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.625
That belongs to all of us.

18:44.291 --> 18:46.625
Didn't I teach you any manners?

18:46.667 --> 18:48.000
I think you slobbered on it.

18:48.041 --> 18:50.875
What? I'm hungry.

18:50.917 --> 18:52.834
Not able to consume bread,

18:52.875 --> 18:54.875
I feel as if

18:52.875 --> 18:54.875
we're missing something.

18:54.917 --> 18:56.750
Maybe if we sniff it?

18:56.792 --> 18:58.417
It's not about the bread.

18:58.458 --> 19:03.000
No. It's about the internal

Made it myself.

19:54.083 --> 19:57.291
Happy Midwinter Morning,

19:54.083 --> 19:57.291
Mr. Prescott.

19:57.333 --> 20:02.166
Oh, same to you, Dani.

20:02.208 --> 20:04.125
Eh, it's the thought

20:02.208 --> 20:04.125
that counts.

20:04.166 --> 20:06.166
Mm.

20:07.542 --> 20:10.083
Despite expectations,

20:07.542 --> 20:10.083
the bonfire has gathered

20:10.125 --> 20:12.208
a surprisingly large

20:10.125 --> 20:12.208
number of citizens.

20:12.250 --> 20:14.583
And everyone looks

20:12.250 --> 20:14.583
pretty happy.

20:14.625 --> 20:16.375
Especially for people

20:14.625 --> 20:16.375
whose presents

20:16.417 --> 20:17.917
are on the bottom

20:16.417 --> 20:17.917
of the ocean.

20:17.959 --> 20:21.166
Boy.

20:17.959 --> 20:21.166
That must be some bread.

20:21.208 --> 20:23.542
Yeah. It is.

20:23.583 --> 20:26.500
Okay, I know this'll come

20:23.583 --> 20:26.500
as a shock, but...

20:26.542 --> 20:28.583
I never liked this holiday.

20:28.625 --> 20:31.625
Oh, really? Shocking.

20:28.625 --> 20:31.625
And you've hidden it so well.

20:31.667 --> 20:33.083
Thank you

20:31.667 --> 20:33.083
for clueing us in.

20:33.125 --> 20:36.375
No, no, no, it's true.

20:33.125 --> 20:36.375
Have to admit though,

20:36.417 --> 20:38.000
was kinda fun saving it.

20:38.041 --> 20:41.667
Kids? Mrs. Neederlander

20:38.041 --> 20:41.667
has asked to speak with us.

20:43.625 --> 20:48.083
Thank you, Charlie. Because

20:43.625 --> 20:48.083
of you and your trusty robots,

20:48.125 --> 20:51.125
we have the holiday

20:48.125 --> 20:51.125
I've been longing for.

20:51.166 --> 20:54.458
People woke up this morning and

20:51.166 --> 20:54.458
held that bread in their hands

20:54.500 --> 20:57.625
and remembered why we celebrate.

20:57.667 --> 21:00.125
But now I've come to realize,

21:00.166 --> 21:02.834
my days as the Rider

21:00.166 --> 21:02.834
are behind me.

21:02.875 --> 21:04.083
Don't say that.

21:04.125 --> 21:06.959
No, it's time

21:04.125 --> 21:06.959
to pass the bread.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.625
Therefore,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.625
I would like to ask,

21:09.667 --> 21:11.458
would you all consider

21:11.500 --> 21:15.709
being the new

21:11.500 --> 21:15.709
Riders of Midwinter?

21:15.750 --> 21:19.500
Mrs. Neederlander, my family

21:15.750 --> 21:19.500
and I would be honored.

21:19.542 --> 21:23.208
Hey! I can be in charge

21:19.542 --> 21:23.208
of baking the bread!

21:25.542 --> 21:28.041
(  soft theme playing  )

21:32.041 --> 21:34.166
(  dramatic theme playing  )
