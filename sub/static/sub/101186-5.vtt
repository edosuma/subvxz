WEBVTT

00:07.641 --> 00:08.809
‐ Special agent Arp.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.078
‐ Welcome back to BBD.
(creature growling)

00:11.111 --> 00:12.679
‐ The Clantons are in Purgatory.

00:12.713 --> 00:15.015
(all): We vow to never forgive.

00:15.048 --> 00:17.417
‐ Sheriff Holt
and Cocaine Cleo are Clantons?

00:17.451 --> 00:19.152
(Doc): And that creature
answers to them.

00:19.186 --> 00:20.654
(screaming)
‐ We can't hang out anymore.

00:20.687 --> 00:23.090
I offer myself!
‐ Now that Waverly

00:23.123 --> 00:24.291
has been returned safely to you,

00:24.324 --> 00:26.593
it's time for you to deliver.
‐ Stay away from us.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.096
(Doc): You're better than this.
‐ What do you want me to do?

00:29.129 --> 00:30.597
‐ I want you to act
like Wyatt Earp's

00:30.631 --> 00:31.765
great‐great‐granddaughter.
‐ Together we take back

00:31.798 --> 00:34.334
the Black Badge offices
in Purgatory,

00:34.368 --> 00:36.737
then we hunt
some goddamn demons.

00:38.572 --> 00:41.375
(soft classical music)

00:41.408 --> 00:44.011
(sighs)

00:46.480 --> 00:49.016
‐ Oh! Boner alert!

00:49.049 --> 00:50.450
(giggling)

00:50.484 --> 00:52.986
‐ Yeah, you look
pretty good too...

00:53.020 --> 00:55.489
Sis.
‐ Yeah, we can get it.

00:55.522 --> 00:56.823
(chuckling)

00:56.857 --> 00:59.226
You ready?
‐ Ready?

00:59.259 --> 01:01.428
Feel like I've been waiting
my whole life.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.730
‐ C'mon.

01:06.233 --> 01:08.268
‐ Oh, I can't believe
I'm walking down the aisle

01:08.302 --> 01:10.571
to become Waverly Earp's wife.

01:11.605 --> 01:14.641
‐ Well, you sacrificed a lot
to keep this place safe.

01:14.675 --> 01:15.976
‐ Well, this place is my home,

01:16.009 --> 01:18.312
and you guys are my family.

01:19.846 --> 01:21.214
‐ If you say so.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.784
(classical music continues)

01:26.286 --> 01:27.821
‐ Wynonna, where's Waverly?

01:27.854 --> 01:30.657
‐ She's not coming.
(ominous music)

01:30.691 --> 01:32.025
Not after what you did.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.362
‐ What did I do?

01:36.863 --> 01:38.599
‐ I want to hear you say it.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.001
‐ I...

01:41.034 --> 01:42.569
(sinister music)

01:43.537 --> 01:45.105
I can't!

01:45.138 --> 01:47.574
(maniacal laughter)

01:48.408 --> 01:50.677
(gasps)
I really can't.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.383
(chuckling)

01:59.119 --> 02:00.520
(Wynonna): Light me up.

02:02.089 --> 02:04.324
After all,
this is a celebration.

02:04.758 --> 02:05.859
‐ A celebration...

02:05.892 --> 02:07.361
(sinister music)

02:07.394 --> 02:09.395
(laughing)

02:10.896 --> 02:12.332
‐ You ready?

02:16.303 --> 02:18.372
(breathing heavily)

02:19.740 --> 02:22.609
(blowing, Nicole coughing)

02:25.679 --> 02:28.682
(all coughing)

02:36.957 --> 02:39.459
(gasps, smoke detector beeping)

02:39.493 --> 02:40.594
(coughing)

02:41.094 --> 02:42.129
(Nicole): Fire.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.296
(coughing)

02:43.330 --> 02:44.364
Fire!

02:46.600 --> 02:47.768
Fire!

02:52.172 --> 02:55.308
♪ 'Cause I gave you
all I got to give ♪

02:55.342 --> 02:57.978
♪ I know that ain't
no way to live ♪

02:58.011 --> 03:00.580
♪ So I told that devil ♪

03:00.614 --> 03:02.849
♪ To take you back ♪

03:02.883 --> 03:05.652
♪ I told that devil ♪

03:05.686 --> 03:07.821
♪ To take you back ♪

03:08.822 --> 03:10.323
(smoke detector beeping)

03:10.357 --> 03:11.892
(coughing)
‐ Baby! Baby!

03:23.804 --> 03:26.173
Baby. Baby.

03:29.576 --> 03:31.812
(coughing)

03:38.185 --> 03:40.587
(gun clicks)
‐ Mornin'.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.790
‐ What are you doing sneaking
around my barn?

03:43.824 --> 03:45.859
‐ What are you doing sleeping
with a pistol

03:45.892 --> 03:46.827
under your pillow?

03:46.860 --> 03:48.995
‐ It's my bedroom.
I'll ask the questions.

03:49.029 --> 03:51.298
(gun clicks)
‐ I've been keeping watch.

03:51.331 --> 03:53.667
‐ Over me?
‐ Over all of you.

03:53.967 --> 03:56.336
As of late, we have been
under siege.

03:57.738 --> 03:58.505
‐ Hey.

03:59.506 --> 04:01.541
"Fastest gunslinger
in the west."

04:02.676 --> 04:04.144
I outdrew you.

04:04.177 --> 04:05.712
‐ I did not draw at all.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.482
‐ Have you ever been outdrawn?

04:09.082 --> 04:10.484
‐ Honestly?

04:12.686 --> 04:13.987
No.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.522
‐ Do you not need to...

04:16.389 --> 04:19.192
...sleep anymore
now that you're...

04:19.226 --> 04:21.027
(hisses)
‐ It's one of the benefits

04:21.060 --> 04:22.963
of my condition.

04:24.297 --> 04:26.233
‐ We don't talk
about that anymore.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.668
‐ There is much we fail
to discuss.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.806
(soft music)

04:43.316 --> 04:45.986
‐ Talking is overrated.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.354
‐ Hmm.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.696
(sniffing)

04:56.730 --> 04:58.398
Doc?
‐ Hmm?

04:58.431 --> 04:59.900
‐ Did you eat another fireman?

04:59.933 --> 05:01.635
(intense music)

05:06.439 --> 05:09.576
Waverly!
‐ Nicole! Rachel!

05:11.011 --> 05:12.646
(coughing)

05:12.679 --> 05:14.714
‐ I put... I put it out,
but we lost the couch.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.516
And most of your porn.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.718
‐ Oh, my God! Waverly!

05:19.820 --> 05:20.787
Shit!

05:21.288 --> 05:22.756
Waverly, wake up!

05:24.191 --> 05:25.425
Breathe, asshole!

05:25.458 --> 05:28.461
(Nicole coughing)
Waverly!

05:28.829 --> 05:31.398
Wake!
(gasps)

05:31.431 --> 05:34.301
(coughing)
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

05:34.334 --> 05:36.670
(Nicole): Oh, my God!
Don't ever do that to me again.

05:36.703 --> 05:39.039
‐ I don't actually know
what I did.

05:40.807 --> 05:42.809
(soft music)

05:43.210 --> 05:45.912
‐ Luckily this old house
was built by strong hands

05:45.946 --> 05:47.314
from stubborn wood.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.316
‐ That's what I used to call
my last boyfriend.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.153
Inappropriate.
‐ Because he died?

05:53.186 --> 05:54.554
Or because he's Waverly's
angel‐dad?

05:55.222 --> 05:56.289
‐ Yes.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.426
‐ Did someone go into
a TikTok trance and forget

05:59.459 --> 06:01.194
they were cooking again?
‐ This isn't on me.

06:01.228 --> 06:04.030
Besides, the fire started
in the living room.

06:04.064 --> 06:04.998
‐ Were you two...

06:05.031 --> 06:07.033
on the couch, and then...
(mimics explosion)

06:07.067 --> 06:08.602
'Cause that's why
they make lube.

06:09.135 --> 06:12.005
‐ That's not why they make lube.
‐ Agree to disagree.

06:12.472 --> 06:14.708
(sighs)
Okay, so if it wasn't Rachel,

06:14.741 --> 06:15.976
or us...

06:16.376 --> 06:17.277
You guys think someone
attacked us?

06:17.310 --> 06:18.979
‐ You mean, attacked us again?

06:19.779 --> 06:20.547
The Clantons.

06:21.147 --> 06:23.149
‐ We don't know for sure
it was them.

06:23.183 --> 06:24.150
(fire crackling)

06:24.184 --> 06:27.120
‐ Well then, who was it?
Doc was keeping watch.

06:27.754 --> 06:30.624
‐ All these prints are our own.

06:31.024 --> 06:33.360
‐ Like what, you've memorized
our shoe sizes?

06:33.393 --> 06:34.561
‐ Correct.

06:34.594 --> 06:37.364
There are no foreign prints
or scents on the perimeter.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.834
Whatever lit the fire,
did not get here on foot.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.837
‐ So it was supernatural.

06:44.938 --> 06:45.805
‐ Perhaps.

06:45.839 --> 06:48.341
‐ Are the Clantons supernatural?

06:48.775 --> 06:50.310
‐ Well, that Reaper they sent
after me,

06:50.343 --> 06:52.412
that slashed me
with its Flo Jo nails...

06:52.445 --> 06:54.414
‐ That Billy called off
with his DIY root canal...

06:54.447 --> 06:56.483
‐‐ That Doc couldn't kill
with his fancy six‐shooter...

06:56.516 --> 06:58.551
Yeah, that thing
was definitely supernatural.

06:58.585 --> 06:59.719
‐ Except it walked on two legs.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.155
‐ So you're saying we just
let them keep coming at us?

07:02.188 --> 07:05.392
‐ I am urging us to find a more
measured response.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.761
‐ This coming from the guy
who works for the biggest

07:07.794 --> 07:10.997
Demon Dong Corleone in town.
‐ I have never seen Amon's...

07:11.698 --> 07:14.334
I definitely do not know
the size of the...

07:16.937 --> 07:19.306
‐ Let's go take a look.

07:21.474 --> 07:24.044
Say hello to my little friend!

07:24.077 --> 07:25.512
(bottle shattering)

07:25.545 --> 07:27.981
(upbeat house music)

07:29.349 --> 07:31.918
I thought you'd be wider.
‐ Wynonna Earp.

07:33.386 --> 07:35.488
The Wynonna Earp.

07:36.489 --> 07:39.359
Doc. I'm so happy
you finally brought her here

07:39.392 --> 07:40.560
to meet me.

07:43.496 --> 07:45.365
‐ Well, she goes
where she pleases.

07:45.398 --> 07:47.567
Despite my protestations.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.703
‐ So you must be Amon.

07:49.736 --> 07:51.905
‐ And in the future,
if you want to hurt me,

07:51.938 --> 07:53.540
just say please.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.675
‐ You seem nice.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.345
‐ We need information.

07:58.378 --> 08:01.815
Somebody tried to set
the Earp Homestead ablaze.

08:01.848 --> 08:02.716
‐ Hmm...

08:03.817 --> 08:06.419
Only a coward would set fire
to a home full of women.

08:06.453 --> 08:08.254
(scoffs)
‐ That's kind of sexist.

08:08.855 --> 08:10.824
And you can just say
The Clantons.

08:10.857 --> 08:11.891
I know it was them.

08:11.925 --> 08:15.729
‐ Um, we try not to say
the "C" word around here.

08:15.762 --> 08:18.865
They've always been a scourge.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.800
‐ Ebenezer or McDuck?

08:20.834 --> 08:24.137
‐ No, love, it's scourge.
Not Scrooge.

08:25.038 --> 08:28.074
‐ Well, if they're not Scrooge,
then what are they?

08:28.108 --> 08:29.542
Demon, Revenant?

08:30.143 --> 08:33.712
‐ Less and a little more
than all of that.

08:36.716 --> 08:37.784
Wynonna...

08:37.817 --> 08:41.421
I think it's high time
that you got your magic gun

08:41.453 --> 08:42.422
and fought back.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.758
‐ Well, that's great advice,
Dorothy Dix‐head.

08:44.791 --> 08:47.027
But I don't know
where Peacemaker is.

08:47.060 --> 08:50.096
(eerie piano music)

08:50.130 --> 08:51.464
‐ But I do.

08:57.837 --> 09:00.940
‐ Yeah, okay, this is gonna
have to go too.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.309
You can take it or donate it

09:03.343 --> 09:05.779
to some sort of...
stripper charity.

09:05.812 --> 09:07.981
‐ Give me one good reason

09:08.014 --> 09:11.518
why I shouldn't pluck
your eyes out like grapes.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.220
And then steal these shades.

09:15.688 --> 09:17.323
‐ Look at me.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.159
I am the captain, now.

09:20.126 --> 09:21.861
By order of BBD.

09:23.596 --> 09:25.165
I trust you received
the paperwork

09:25.198 --> 09:27.367
handing this office back to me?
‐ I did.

09:27.400 --> 09:28.334
‐ Good.

09:28.835 --> 09:30.637
(sighs)

09:32.939 --> 09:35.041
‐ Argh!
(glass shattering)

09:35.542 --> 09:37.811
‐ One less thing for the movers
to get rid of.

09:37.844 --> 09:38.845
And they'll be here soon.

09:38.878 --> 09:41.848
Along with my team
of special agents,

09:41.881 --> 09:43.850
so feel free to leave
at any time.

09:43.883 --> 09:44.784
Thank you.

09:47.053 --> 09:49.355
‐ For God's sakes,
grow some balls, brother,

09:49.389 --> 09:52.725
before this entire town gets
pulled out from underneath us.

09:53.059 --> 09:54.727
‐ Mam told us to stand down.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.062
You really want
to cross her again?

09:56.896 --> 09:58.865
‐ Aren't you tired of waiting

09:58.898 --> 10:00.533
for someone else
to make our fate?

10:01.067 --> 10:02.135
‐ I've made my fate.

10:02.168 --> 10:06.005
But I'd be lying
if I didn't say, I am tired.

10:07.373 --> 10:08.241
Waverly, Ms. Haught.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.176
‐ We know what you did.
‐ What's that?

10:10.210 --> 10:11.911
Beat you out for being Sheriff?

10:11.945 --> 10:14.047
‐ Hey! You came!

10:14.080 --> 10:15.748
‐ Of course we came!

10:15.782 --> 10:18.718
(excited shouting)

10:18.751 --> 10:19.452
‐ Hey!

10:20.520 --> 10:23.089
‐ You kinda fell off
the face of the earth on me.

10:24.257 --> 10:27.093
‐ Uh... there was a lot
going on.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.028
And I knew
you could handle yourself.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.663
‐ Is that what I did?

10:31.431 --> 10:33.600
‐ We brought you
an office‐warming gift!

10:33.633 --> 10:34.667
‐ Oh! Wicked!

10:34.701 --> 10:36.603
Wha‐‐ What do I put in it?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.638
‐ Balls!
‐ I love balls!

10:38.671 --> 10:41.107
‐ I know!
(laughing)

10:41.741 --> 10:44.277
‐ Why do you smell like burnt
marshmallow cologne?

10:45.512 --> 10:46.412
Is it unisex?

10:49.315 --> 10:51.451
‐ So, one of the benefits
of owning a club

10:51.484 --> 10:56.022
is demons generally
can't hold their liquor.

10:58.057 --> 11:00.360
‐ I'm not drinking
that roofie‐colada.

11:01.761 --> 11:03.763
‐ Yeah, they're just
a bunch of sad,

11:03.796 --> 11:06.299
lonely, horny,

11:06.599 --> 11:08.368
sometimes literally horny...

11:08.401 --> 11:10.770
demons, drinking
and running their mouths.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.105
‐ Much the same as you are now.

11:12.138 --> 11:14.107
‐ So I heard...

11:14.140 --> 11:16.276
a few talk about a place...

11:16.309 --> 11:19.312
where cherished but forgotten
items end up.

11:19.879 --> 11:21.881
‐ Peacemaker wasn't forgotten.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.150
She just kinda disappeared
on me.

11:24.184 --> 11:27.120
‐ And why, pray tell,
would you help a demon‐hunter

11:27.153 --> 11:29.289
find her demon slaying weapon?

11:29.322 --> 11:32.592
‐ Well, because The Clantons
are more powerful than me.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.827
And I don't bottom for anyone.

11:35.094 --> 11:37.630
Not even you.
‐ Oh!

11:37.664 --> 11:38.965
Isn't he like your boss?

11:38.998 --> 11:40.300
You should call H. R.

11:41.768 --> 11:42.669
‐ There is a catch.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.939
The people who have Peacemaker

11:45.972 --> 11:48.174
are going to want an offering.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.678
‐ Gold, frankincense?
Tickets to Lizzo?

11:52.412 --> 11:55.114
‐ Once you have what they need,
they'll find you.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.883
‐ And if this turns out to be
a wild goose chase,

11:56.916 --> 11:59.786
we're gonna come back here and‐‐
‐ Kill the shit out of you.

11:59.819 --> 12:01.254
‐ What she said.

12:07.026 --> 12:08.895
‐ Fucking Clantons.

12:08.928 --> 12:10.830
‐ These are the last
of the BBD files

12:10.863 --> 12:11.864
we had stashed at the Homestead.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.767
‐ Nice. Uh, just put them
by the cabinets. Thanks.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.036
(door locks)
‐ There.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.738
That should keep out
Blah and Order for a while.

12:18.771 --> 12:21.774
(lock clatters to the floor)
‐ Get over here, Nerd‐Burger!

12:23.543 --> 12:24.811
‐ Hey!

12:25.211 --> 12:28.314
‐ You are a welcome sight
for these sore eyes.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.482
‐ Doc.

12:30.016 --> 12:31.884
Oh, it feels so good
to be home.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.620
And in your arms.

12:34.687 --> 12:38.157
‐ Alright. So, g‐‐
Boners, listen up...

12:38.858 --> 12:41.894
Turns out The Clantons
are more than meets the eyes.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.831
Amon wouldn't say exactly what,
but he's scared of them.

12:44.864 --> 12:45.498
And...

12:46.266 --> 12:47.700
He knows where Peacemaker is.

12:47.734 --> 12:50.069
(Nicole chuckles)
‐ A demon wants to help you

12:50.103 --> 12:52.605
find Peacemaker?
‐ We do not know how accurate

12:52.639 --> 12:54.941
this intelligence is.

12:54.974 --> 12:56.709
‐ So where is it? Spill!

12:56.743 --> 12:59.345
(Wynonna): Okay, well,
I don't know, but...

12:59.379 --> 13:02.649
(ominous music, drill whirring)

13:05.418 --> 13:07.720
Yo! Extreme Makeover:
Homo Edition,

13:07.754 --> 13:09.255
kill the drill.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.089
‐ Sorry.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.225
You know me and power tools.

13:12.258 --> 13:15.028
‐ It is risky, to put our faith
in a demon

13:15.061 --> 13:15.995
with questionable morals.

13:16.029 --> 13:18.965
‐ I don't know, worked for me
in the past.

13:18.998 --> 13:20.900
‐ I mean, what choice
do we have?

13:20.933 --> 13:22.535
All my BBD weapons failed you.

13:22.568 --> 13:25.571
‐ Uh, yeah. We scoured
the GRT for Peacemaker

13:25.605 --> 13:26.873
and... Yahtzee.

13:26.906 --> 13:29.275
‐ We really need to teach you
how to play that game properly.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.411
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐ So then we agree.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.646
Even though Amon is a sexy...
‐ Ahem!

13:33.680 --> 13:36.149
‐ Sketchy... demon douche,

13:36.182 --> 13:37.750
I have to trust him.

13:40.586 --> 13:43.556
‐ The team appears
to be unanimous.

13:43.589 --> 13:45.591
‐ Yeah. Speaking of the team,
has anyone seen Rachel

13:45.625 --> 13:46.726
since this morning?

13:47.827 --> 13:50.196
(phone vibrating)

13:52.799 --> 13:54.167
(typing)

13:54.200 --> 13:55.735
‐ At the Rec Center.

13:56.202 --> 13:58.237
So lame. Barf emoji.

13:58.271 --> 14:01.441
Home for dinner... maybe.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.815
(eerie music)

14:14.387 --> 14:17.790
‐ Huh. Who knew the Ghost
River Triangle had a museum.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.258
‐ Literally everyone?

14:20.560 --> 14:21.794
(sighs)

14:21.828 --> 14:23.329
‐ They shouldn't let
mean girls in here.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.498
This should be a sacred space
for geeks.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.468
Like Comic‐Con.
‐ Special Collections.

14:28.501 --> 14:30.269
A woman scorned.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.438
‐ She doesn't even go here!

14:34.507 --> 14:36.909
Now you mu‐see‐um,
now you don't.

14:37.677 --> 14:40.179
(man speaking in film)

14:41.147 --> 14:42.415
Wrong turn, MapQuest.

14:42.448 --> 14:45.151
(man): ...working as a stunt
consultant on the film set...

14:45.184 --> 14:46.786
‐ Is this the guy
from Big Lebowski?

14:46.819 --> 14:48.454
‐ I've been called many things,

14:48.488 --> 14:53.025
Hero, lawman,
murderer.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.462
But destiny is that
which we are drawn towards.

14:56.863 --> 15:00.767
And fate...
is that which we run into.

15:01.567 --> 15:04.170
So you tell me
if I had a choice.

15:04.203 --> 15:05.671
‐ No, Wynonna.

15:05.705 --> 15:08.174
That is your great,
great‐grandfather.

15:08.207 --> 15:09.342
Wyatt Earp.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.477
(soft Western music)

15:14.414 --> 15:16.649
(distant giggling)
‐ Hello.

15:16.682 --> 15:19.018
Whoa! Okay, uh, sorry.

15:19.051 --> 15:20.987
Did not mean to pull
a Wynonna on you.

15:21.287 --> 15:23.389
Why is Cleo's couch
still here?

15:24.190 --> 15:25.858
‐ Um, well, you know...
‐ We...

15:25.892 --> 15:28.594
‐ we asked the movers,
um, to put it back...

15:28.628 --> 15:31.531
‐ So we could all have
a place to hang out.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.433
‐ Oh. Okay, yeah. "Hang out".

15:33.466 --> 15:35.835
Is that what the queer lady
kids are calling it these days?

15:35.868 --> 15:36.602
‐ Look. Binders!

15:36.636 --> 15:38.538
(laughing)

15:38.571 --> 15:41.073
‐ These are the archives
that BBD had

15:41.107 --> 15:43.109
on the Old West Families
of the GRT.

15:43.142 --> 15:44.577
‐ Oh, cool!
‐ There must be something

15:44.610 --> 15:45.711
in here that can help us
figure out

15:45.745 --> 15:48.347
what The Clantons are.
‐ Yeah and how to take them down

15:48.381 --> 15:50.216
in case Wynonna
can't find Peacemaker.

15:50.249 --> 15:51.851
‐ She's gonna find Peacemaker.

15:51.884 --> 15:52.718
‐ I couldn't.

15:53.419 --> 15:55.455
‐ Yeah, well,
you're not the Earp heir.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.590
‐ Would you have called
more often if I was?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.494
‐ On my phone
that was being monitored?

16:03.729 --> 16:06.265
‐ Jeremy, where is Robin?

16:07.433 --> 16:10.403
‐ Look, all that matters
is he's safe.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.372
We should get to work.
‐ Okay. You're being super

16:13.406 --> 16:14.540
cagey about this.
‐ Yeah, Nicole,

16:14.574 --> 16:17.510
because a lot of stuff
happened while they...

16:18.077 --> 16:19.579
While you were in the Garden.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.914
And everyone
that was left behind, we just...

16:23.583 --> 16:27.019
We all did
what we had to do to survive.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.255
Okay?

16:32.358 --> 16:34.060
(pained groaning)

16:34.093 --> 16:36.028
Shit, I'm sorry.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.798
I think I'm allergic
to leopard print, or...

16:41.133 --> 16:43.436
(pained groaning)

16:44.003 --> 16:46.239
(eerie music)

16:46.272 --> 16:48.307
(screaming)

16:48.341 --> 16:50.476
‐ What is happening to me?

16:51.177 --> 16:52.645
(coughing)

16:58.484 --> 17:00.386
‐ I can't wait anymore.

17:02.121 --> 17:04.089
It's been over a year.

17:06.826 --> 17:07.926
Can you help?

17:07.960 --> 17:10.195
‐ I would very much like to,

17:10.229 --> 17:12.464
but the price is steep.

17:12.498 --> 17:13.900
‐ I will do...

17:13.933 --> 17:17.103
I will do, I will do anything
to get her back.

17:17.837 --> 17:18.838
Please.

17:20.239 --> 17:21.741
‐ Even this?

17:23.309 --> 17:25.511
(whispering)

17:32.251 --> 17:34.020
‐ If you'll save them
from the Garden.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.756
(chuckling)

17:39.191 --> 17:41.494
(Mam's laughter echoing)
No....

17:41.527 --> 17:43.963
No, I couldn't
have promised that.

17:43.996 --> 17:46.198
(pained groaning, shouting)

17:46.232 --> 17:48.334
‐ Nicole, what's wrong?

17:49.302 --> 17:51.671
Hey. Hey.

17:51.704 --> 17:54.307
‐ Waverly,
it's all coming back to me.

17:54.340 --> 17:58.177
I... I did something terrible
when you were in the Garden.

17:58.210 --> 17:59.679
‐ What?

18:00.046 --> 18:02.315
‐ I‐I...
(vomiting)

18:02.348 --> 18:04.150
‐ Sweetie, it's okay.

18:04.183 --> 18:06.018
Just spit it out.

18:06.052 --> 18:08.888
(vomiting)

18:11.257 --> 18:13.092
(frogs croaking)
(Jeremy): Oh, my God.

18:13.125 --> 18:14.727
You ate a billion frogs.

18:19.131 --> 18:23.269
‐ In 1878, I was at a card tabl
in Texas,

18:23.302 --> 18:26.238
and a man drew a pistol
at my back.

18:26.272 --> 18:29.342
I heard the shot, and I smelled
the gun powder.

18:30.076 --> 18:33.446
My would‐be executioner
behind me fell.

18:33.813 --> 18:37.583
Shot to death
by a dentist, of all things.

18:38.050 --> 18:42.021
John Henry Holliday
saved my life.

18:42.688 --> 18:46.158
I knew then,
I was bound to him.

18:46.192 --> 18:47.593
Forever.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.961
‐ Who was the shooter?

18:48.995 --> 18:51.163
‐ It never occurred to me
to inquire.

18:51.197 --> 18:53.432
Any man that would shoot
another man in the back

18:53.466 --> 18:56.736
does not deserve
to be known, or remembered.

18:56.769 --> 19:00.940
(man speaking in film)

19:00.973 --> 19:02.642
‐ You miss it, don't you?

19:03.175 --> 19:05.711
‐ The rules were simpler then.

19:06.278 --> 19:08.581
‐ Like "don't try
to steal our baby"?

19:09.982 --> 19:11.083
‐ Rosita.

19:11.117 --> 19:12.084
‐ If Revenants
were still around,

19:12.118 --> 19:13.819
she'd be my first
appointment back

19:13.853 --> 19:15.755
when I got Peacemaker.

19:15.788 --> 19:17.056
(gunshot)

19:17.089 --> 19:19.325
(man): Let's talk about
the O. K. Corral.

19:19.358 --> 19:21.460
(Wyatt): I have resisted
in the past...

19:21.494 --> 19:23.596
(man): It made you famous.
(laughing)

19:23.629 --> 19:25.097
‐ That is true.

19:25.531 --> 19:28.234
But I knew there'd never
be peace in Tombstone,

19:28.267 --> 19:31.671
or anywhere else with those
vermin Clantons around.

19:32.538 --> 19:35.274
To tell the truth, I was glad
when Doc Holliday

19:35.307 --> 19:36.375
took the first shot.

19:37.309 --> 19:39.879
What's the point of locking up
backwater scum...

19:39.912 --> 19:41.480
‐ I did not shoot first.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.683
(Wyatt): Sooner or later,
they simply slide

19:43.716 --> 19:46.752
through the bars,
makes everything dirty again.

19:47.753 --> 19:51.190
That man was the most
talented loose cannon

19:51.223 --> 19:53.025
I ever did see.

19:53.059 --> 19:56.562
At the end of our...
time together,

19:57.329 --> 20:00.533
I just rolled Doc off whatever
whore he was enjoying

20:00.566 --> 20:03.536
on that particular day,
and point him in the direction

20:03.569 --> 20:07.673
of someone who needed
to be got clean through.

20:08.841 --> 20:09.842
‐ Geezers get fuzzy.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.544
They remember things
the way they want to.

20:11.577 --> 20:12.678
Not the way they happened.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.847
‐ Yeah, well, I do not have
the luxury of growing old

20:14.880 --> 20:16.982
and forgetting
all the things I have done.

20:19.719 --> 20:20.986
‐ Well, next time
don't make a deal

20:21.020 --> 20:23.389
with a stone witch
and then became a vampire.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.361
What would Wyatt
think of all this?

20:30.029 --> 20:31.931
Do you think
he'd be proud of me?

20:32.465 --> 20:34.700
‐ I am no longer certain

20:34.734 --> 20:36.969
that you
would be proud of him.

20:38.304 --> 20:41.140
Come now. We have a heist
to attend to.

20:41.373 --> 20:43.542
(soft music)

20:44.810 --> 20:47.413
(Wyatt continues talking)

20:50.616 --> 20:53.652
‐ Ugh...
‐ You are massacring that onion.

20:55.321 --> 20:56.589
Your hand still hurting?

20:56.622 --> 20:58.424
‐ Yeah, but I guess
I deserve it.

20:58.758 --> 21:01.727
‐ Nobody deserves this.
‐ Wish you'd tell her that.

21:02.228 --> 21:04.029
‐ You first.
(door slamming)

21:07.066 --> 21:08.534
(chuckles)

21:08.567 --> 21:10.603
‐ You're always so goddamn
emotional.

21:10.636 --> 21:12.138
‐ It's from the onion.

21:12.171 --> 21:15.274
‐ My whole life, I obsessed

21:15.307 --> 21:18.711
over the happenings
at the O. K. Corral.

21:19.245 --> 21:22.281
Half a minute that wiped out
our entire clan.

21:22.314 --> 21:24.049
But now...

21:24.083 --> 21:27.386
finally, I have cause
for celebration.

21:29.688 --> 21:31.524
When I die,

21:31.557 --> 21:35.127
the charm that I possess
will pass to my children.

21:35.161 --> 21:37.663
Now, I have spent many
long nights

21:37.696 --> 21:41.133
worrying over which of you
will get the gift.

21:41.767 --> 21:43.402
Made me near sick with dread,

21:43.435 --> 21:46.405
thinking our legacy
would be left

21:46.438 --> 21:48.741
in your bumbling hands.

21:49.375 --> 21:51.644
But then I read
something on Oprah‐dot‐com,

21:51.677 --> 21:54.814
made me change my tune.
"I will not...

21:54.847 --> 21:58.450
give my power over
to the circumstances

21:58.484 --> 22:00.252
of my life."

22:00.286 --> 22:02.054
‐ Mam, what are you saying?

22:02.521 --> 22:05.124
‐ I have set the wheels
in motion

22:05.157 --> 22:07.493
for the end of our enemies.

22:07.526 --> 22:10.930
To the end... of the Earps.

22:12.498 --> 22:15.501
(eerie music)

22:15.534 --> 22:18.470
So why is it you two
look like you're at a funeral?

22:18.838 --> 22:21.173
‐ If it's all the same to you,
I'd like to know the plan

22:21.207 --> 22:22.241
before I celebrate it.

22:22.274 --> 22:24.977
‐ Yeah, um, how exactly
do you plan

22:25.010 --> 22:26.478
on killing the Earps?

22:26.512 --> 22:27.580
‐ Honey, the Earps
and Doc Holliday

22:27.613 --> 22:31.150
don't deserve death.
They deserve to be destroyed.

22:32.318 --> 22:33.586
By one another.

22:35.754 --> 22:37.022
(glass breaking)

22:37.790 --> 22:39.992
‐ Damn women's softball league.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.360
‐ I need booze!

22:41.393 --> 22:43.028
‐ You look like you need
an ambulance.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.663
‐ Whatever's wrong with her,
it can't be fixed

22:44.697 --> 22:45.965
with modern medicine.

22:45.998 --> 22:46.899
‐ Have you tried chicken soup

22:46.932 --> 22:47.933
and a One Day At A Time
marathon?

22:47.967 --> 22:50.502
‐ Tequila. I gotta get
the taste of frogs

22:50.536 --> 22:51.503
out of my mouth.

22:51.537 --> 22:54.673
‐ Did you say frogs?
‐ Oh boy, did she ever.

22:55.107 --> 22:56.976
‐ Well yeah, apparently
she did something terrible.

22:57.009 --> 23:00.112
But every time she tries
to tell us what it is,
she throws up.

23:00.579 --> 23:02.214
(gagging)
‐ So we're dealing with what,

23:02.248 --> 23:03.415
some kind of hex?

23:03.449 --> 23:05.551
With all the new creatures
in town, it could be anything.

23:05.584 --> 23:07.686
A warlock? An incubus?
A SpongeBob?

23:07.720 --> 23:09.889
‐ Aww. You did research!

23:09.922 --> 23:11.257
Sort of.
(vomiting)

23:11.290 --> 23:12.892
‐ We tried guessing for her too.

23:12.925 --> 23:15.160
But every time we do,
it's Big‐Vom‐Dot‐Com.

23:15.194 --> 23:16.362
(frogs croaking)
‐ Oh...

23:16.395 --> 23:17.897
‐ I don't...
(vomiting)

23:17.930 --> 23:20.532
‐ No, you just shut
your frog hole.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.738
No! Not on the froggies.

23:25.771 --> 23:27.606
What? It's not their fault.

23:28.774 --> 23:31.210
Sweetie...
‐ I need a pen!

23:32.077 --> 23:34.847
If I can't tell you guys,
maybe, I can...

23:34.880 --> 23:37.283
(Nicole breathing heavily)
‐ Okay, okay, okay...

23:37.316 --> 23:38.984
You were cursed by...

23:40.886 --> 23:41.787
Sperm?

23:41.820 --> 23:44.256
‐ What?
‐ No. I think they're tadpoles.

23:44.290 --> 23:45.190
‐ That makes
much more sense. Yup.

23:45.224 --> 23:46.125
‐ I was trying to write words!

23:46.158 --> 23:48.594
‐ Look, it seems to me the thing
to do here

23:48.627 --> 23:49.995
is to forget about the cause.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.932
We need to focus on a cure.
‐ Okay.

23:52.965 --> 23:54.967
What‐‐
(vomiting)

23:55.734 --> 23:57.436
(frogs croaking, Nicole crying)

23:57.469 --> 23:59.571
‐ Oh, my God.
‐ Indeed.

23:59.605 --> 24:00.739
‐ You're sure this is it?

24:00.773 --> 24:04.443
‐ Only someone truly evil
would value this abomination.

24:04.476 --> 24:06.445
‐ It's called "A Woman Scorned".

24:06.478 --> 24:07.613
You know who got scorned?

24:07.646 --> 24:10.716
The doink who paid actual money
for this wank of art.

24:12.017 --> 24:13.319
So, um...

24:13.352 --> 24:15.054
Should I slip into my Catsuit

24:15.087 --> 24:16.989
and slink through
the security lasers?

24:17.022 --> 24:19.158
‐ As much as I would love
to see that...

24:19.658 --> 24:21.226
we have already dawdled
too long.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.162
‐ Right. So we shoot out
the cameras,

24:23.195 --> 24:25.497
knock out the elderly volunteer
behind the desk,

24:25.531 --> 24:27.800
and hop a train to Mexico.
‐ Or...

24:27.833 --> 24:30.469
(Wynonna shivers)
‐ Still hot.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.805
‐ You can't just like,
take stuff.

24:32.838 --> 24:35.240
‐ Wise words from a leader
of tomorrow.

24:35.774 --> 24:38.010
Get bent, Regina Bored!

24:38.043 --> 24:39.912
(Wynonna laughing)

24:40.779 --> 24:41.647
Now what?

24:41.680 --> 24:43.816
‐ Amon said once
we procured the painting,

24:43.849 --> 24:45.718
the collectors would appear.

24:46.952 --> 24:48.587
‐ That's a big ass tramp stamp.

24:51.290 --> 24:52.992
‐ It's a Celtic Sisters Knot.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.661
It symbolizes sisterhood
and the strong, eternal bond

24:55.694 --> 24:56.762
that women share.

24:56.795 --> 24:59.932
I once made the acquaintance
of some sorority sisters

24:59.965 --> 25:01.100
from Wesleyan.

25:01.133 --> 25:04.036
They did in fact have tattoos
of that symbol on their‐‐

25:04.069 --> 25:05.104
‐ Great story.

25:05.704 --> 25:08.173
(loud chiming bells)
‐ Ahh!

25:09.608 --> 25:12.277
(chiming stops)

25:13.679 --> 25:15.748
‐ What in tarnation?

25:18.917 --> 25:20.119
Wynonna?!

25:21.820 --> 25:24.857
‐ What the... hell‐o?!

25:25.257 --> 25:28.327
‐ Welcome to the Sanctuary
of the Scorned Woman.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.862
‐ Oh damn.

25:29.895 --> 25:32.031
J. C. ghost you on Bumble?

25:32.064 --> 25:34.633
‐ These are dangerous
and uncertain times,

25:34.666 --> 25:37.136
Wynonna Earp.
‐ Oh great, you've heard of me.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.704
Wait. Is that great?

25:38.737 --> 25:41.040
‐ This sanctuary is a place
of cleansing

25:41.073 --> 25:43.776
for women who have lost
their way.

25:44.610 --> 25:46.178
Women like you.

25:46.745 --> 25:48.547
(Wynonna): Says who,
Mother Inferior?

25:48.580 --> 25:50.916
I'm exactly where I want to be.

25:50.949 --> 25:53.052
‐ I see I've struck a chord.

25:53.085 --> 25:56.255
‐ Yeah. You struck
the whole damn choir, Whoopi.

25:56.288 --> 25:58.023
‐ You misunderstand me.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.692
I'm releasing these women
from the judgments

26:00.726 --> 26:02.661
they've placed on themselves.

26:02.694 --> 26:04.196
I could do the same for you.

26:04.229 --> 26:07.433
(Wynonna scoffs): I'm not really
a habit kind of gal.

26:07.466 --> 26:10.502
Unless those habits include,
uh, you know,

26:10.536 --> 26:11.770
cheap whiskey and broody men.

26:11.804 --> 26:15.441
I'm just here because you have
something that belongs to me.

26:15.474 --> 26:17.576
And... vicey‐versey.

26:17.609 --> 26:19.812
(soft ethereal music)

26:23.749 --> 26:25.617
(speaking Latin):
Purga te, mulier,

26:25.651 --> 26:27.986
et liberi eritis.

26:29.154 --> 26:31.890
‐ Hey, you break it,
you bought it.

26:31.924 --> 26:32.925
Holy shit.

26:32.958 --> 26:34.793
‐ I don't want the painting.

26:34.827 --> 26:38.163
I want the woman
in the painting.

26:38.764 --> 26:42.134
‐ And I want my sword‐gun back.

26:42.534 --> 26:44.369
‐ Then take it.

26:45.871 --> 26:47.906
‐ Peacemaker, where you at,
Mama?

26:49.475 --> 26:51.977
It's me, old girl.
It's Wynonna.

26:53.512 --> 26:54.947
Peacemaker, come!

26:54.980 --> 26:57.616
‐ Perhaps the weapon
is rejecting you

26:57.649 --> 27:00.219
because its duty to you
is complete.

27:01.587 --> 27:03.355
‐ Now you listen to me, godda‐‐

27:04.656 --> 27:06.525
Gosh doink‐it!

27:07.159 --> 27:09.695
The curse may be broken,
but they still need me.

27:10.329 --> 27:12.598
Alright, everybody still
needs me to keep them safe.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.967
So this thing between you and I

27:14.967 --> 27:17.970
ain't over until
I say it's over!

27:18.003 --> 27:23.108
‐ Perhaps it's time for you
to choose a life of peace.

27:23.142 --> 27:23.976
‐ How?

27:24.943 --> 27:27.112
When the monsters keep coming
and coming,

27:27.146 --> 27:30.315
how am I supposed to live
a normal life?

27:32.684 --> 27:34.920
And why the fuck
would I want to?

27:42.561 --> 27:45.864
‐ Wa

27:45.898 --> 27:48.333
‐ Uh, best you refrain
from saying something

27:48.367 --> 27:50.002
we'll both regret.

27:50.035 --> 27:51.703
(indistinct chattering)

27:51.737 --> 27:53.505
I don't know
where Wynonna went,

27:53.539 --> 27:56.074
but if it was a trap
it wasn't set by me.

27:56.108 --> 27:57.643
Because, I don't pick sides.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.312
I'm in it for myself.
Does that sound familiar?

28:00.345 --> 28:03.215
‐ You would do well...
(gun clicking)

28:03.248 --> 28:06.218
...not to compare yourself
to me.

28:06.251 --> 28:07.686
‐ Oh, come on, Doc.

28:07.719 --> 28:10.756
It's a compliment.
It's how we've both managed

28:10.789 --> 28:13.192
to survive for centuries.

28:13.225 --> 28:14.726
‐ I am no cockroach.

28:14.760 --> 28:17.529
‐ No. But you're still alive.

28:17.563 --> 28:21.900
‐ Noble men do not have
the luxury of being neutral

28:21.934 --> 28:23.035
in times of war.

28:26.071 --> 28:28.674
(rhythmic music)

28:31.643 --> 28:34.880
We have not been
formally introduced.

28:36.315 --> 28:38.717
‐ I know who you are,
you know who I am.

28:38.750 --> 28:40.552
So what do you actually want?

28:40.586 --> 28:43.255
‐ There are more traditional
spots for a man like you

28:43.288 --> 28:44.423
to wet his whistle.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.558
‐ I'm not a traditionalist.

28:48.627 --> 28:50.195
I just wanted a beer.

28:50.662 --> 28:52.464
‐ You are a bold sort,

28:52.497 --> 28:54.733
I will give you that.
The whole Clanton lot.

28:54.766 --> 28:56.868
‐ You keep my family's name
out of your mouth, you hear?

28:56.902 --> 29:00.005
‐ You would be dead
before you drew.

29:02.841 --> 29:05.644
‐ This whole "Fastest Gunslinger
in the West"?

29:05.677 --> 29:07.546
Is that something
to be proud of?

29:07.579 --> 29:09.848
Shooting people who don't
have a chance to fight back?

29:11.783 --> 29:13.785
‐ Some people deserve
to be shot.

29:13.819 --> 29:14.820
‐ And who decides that?

29:16.088 --> 29:18.156
Because the history books
say one thing,

29:18.190 --> 29:19.758
my family says another.

29:24.630 --> 29:26.999
(laughing)

29:27.032 --> 29:28.267
So you tell me...

29:30.569 --> 29:32.638
Do you deserve a bullet?

29:32.671 --> 29:34.406
(setting gun down)

29:34.439 --> 29:35.907
Or do I?

29:38.677 --> 29:40.078
(gun clicking)

29:41.713 --> 29:44.650
Maybe... I let fate decide?

29:47.519 --> 29:49.755
‐ Whatever side we fight on,

29:50.422 --> 29:53.258
the blood we shed
to win the war

29:53.292 --> 29:54.760
will damn us all.

29:58.897 --> 30:00.766
‐ It's not a war, Holliday.

30:02.501 --> 30:03.802
It's just a town.

30:03.835 --> 30:06.171
Filled with women who would
have us both

30:06.204 --> 30:07.272
fight to the death.

30:21.420 --> 30:24.122
‐ Hey.
‐ I'm sorry, Waverly.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.224
‐ No. Don't apologize.

30:26.258 --> 30:28.360
I like taking care of you.

30:29.294 --> 30:32.264
I'd be happy do it
for the rest of our lives.

30:33.398 --> 30:36.902
‐ Yeah. I guess we gotta
talk about the engagement...

30:38.170 --> 30:38.937
‐ Yeah.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.575
But it's hard to make it
a priority,

30:43.608 --> 30:45.911
when, you know, you're voiding
amphibians.

30:45.944 --> 30:48.213
‐ No, it's not that, Waverly.

30:48.246 --> 30:50.582
It's that I‐‐
(gagging)

30:50.615 --> 30:51.950
‐ You did something terrible.

30:52.784 --> 30:56.154
Right? But you being you,
how terrible could it be?

30:57.522 --> 30:58.724
‐ Okay, guys.

30:59.224 --> 31:01.860
I have dug up three
possible cures.

31:02.461 --> 31:05.330
Option number one:

31:05.364 --> 31:07.599
a spell‐reflecting ceremony.

31:07.632 --> 31:09.735
Worst case scenario,
we do it wrong,

31:09.768 --> 31:11.370
and you turn into a demon dog.

31:11.403 --> 31:12.738
‐ Ugh, pass.

31:12.771 --> 31:14.406
I'm a cat person.

31:14.439 --> 31:16.208
‐ Yeah, me too. Okay...

31:16.241 --> 31:18.210
Option number two:

31:18.243 --> 31:20.979
an exorcism where we drown you
in salted holy water.

31:21.012 --> 31:23.115
‐ Drown me?
‐ You caught that part, huh?

31:23.148 --> 31:25.450
‐ Yeah. We are not
drowning my girlfriend.

31:25.484 --> 31:26.852
‐ Okay, fine.

31:27.319 --> 31:28.854
Option number three:

31:28.887 --> 31:30.622
we brew an antidote soup

31:30.655 --> 31:32.791
made out of fennel,
jasmine, and nettles.

31:32.824 --> 31:34.459
‐ That sounds okay.
‐ Worst case scenario?

31:34.493 --> 31:36.528
‐ If we don't get the correct
ratio of ingredients,

31:36.561 --> 31:39.030
uh, your intestines
might turn into snakes.

31:41.099 --> 31:42.934
These really
were the only choices.

31:42.968 --> 31:46.772
‐ Okay, so, uh... let's do um...

31:47.672 --> 31:49.274
...snake‐gut soup?

31:49.608 --> 31:53.078
‐ Yeah.
‐ Plus with Purgatory's best,

31:53.111 --> 31:55.914
brightest, most beautiful
brains on the case,

31:55.947 --> 31:57.449
I mean, I'm gonna be cured
in no‐‐

31:57.482 --> 31:59.217
(gagging)

31:59.251 --> 31:59.985
‐ Okay...

32:00.685 --> 32:02.320
(vomiting)
‐ What in unholy hell

32:02.354 --> 32:03.422
have you been eating?

32:04.689 --> 32:05.557
‐ I got it.

32:08.126 --> 32:09.828
(tense music)

32:09.861 --> 32:11.897
It's like she puked
the Dagobah System.

32:20.338 --> 32:22.741
(phone vibrating)

32:30.382 --> 32:31.383
(sighs)

32:34.886 --> 32:37.222
(phone ringing tone)

32:37.889 --> 32:40.325
(fire crackling)

32:41.493 --> 32:43.995
(distant cell phone ringtone)

32:47.365 --> 32:48.433
(door closing)

32:49.868 --> 32:52.137
‐ I come bearing apology beer.

32:53.371 --> 32:55.440
Waverly told me everything.

32:55.474 --> 32:56.675
(Nicole sighs)

32:56.708 --> 32:59.311
I'm really sorry
about Spewapalooza.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.446
Obviously the Clantons
came after me,

33:01.480 --> 33:03.215
and you got caught
in the frog fire.

33:03.248 --> 33:04.516
(can opening)

33:04.549 --> 33:06.885
‐ It wasn't you, Wynonna.
(sighing)

33:06.918 --> 33:08.620
‐ I wouldn't blame you
for not wanting

33:08.653 --> 33:10.121
to join this family, honestly.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.791
First it's Revenants,
then frogs,

33:12.824 --> 33:15.026
next it'll be fiery hail
and locusts.

33:15.060 --> 33:17.162
(laughing)
‐ Well, it would take a lot more

33:17.195 --> 33:18.997
than some Egyptian plagues

33:19.030 --> 33:20.799
to keep me from wanting
to marry your sister.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.334
‐ Then what are you two
waiting for?

33:23.835 --> 33:25.470
‐ I'm scared Waverly
won't want to

33:25.504 --> 33:26.738
when she finds out what I did.

33:26.771 --> 33:28.507
‐ Pfft. I wanna ask
what that is,

33:28.540 --> 33:29.341
but I just
de‐honked my boots.

33:29.374 --> 33:31.009
(chuckling)

33:32.010 --> 33:34.145
Well, here's what I know
you didn't do...

33:35.213 --> 33:37.649
You didn't give up on us
when we were in the Garden.

33:37.949 --> 33:39.918
And a year and a half,
that's a long time

33:39.951 --> 33:41.319
to keep the faith.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.122
‐ Thing is, I did give up.

33:44.923 --> 33:45.857
Not at first.

33:45.891 --> 33:50.095
At first, I believed
that Waverly, and you,

33:50.128 --> 33:52.631
and Doc were gonna
get home safe.

33:53.298 --> 33:56.401
Then 18 months went by,
and so I woke up one day and...

33:56.434 --> 33:57.469
(gagging)

33:57.502 --> 34:01.640
‐ Nicole. Did you do
something to get us home?

34:01.673 --> 34:04.042
(gagging)
Never mind, I didn't ask,

34:04.075 --> 34:05.844
I didn't ask.
La‐la‐la‐la.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.479
‐ Oh, God.

34:10.282 --> 34:11.917
‐ Do you wanna hear
my sob story?

34:11.949 --> 34:13.717
‐ Un‐huh, I do, really.

34:14.351 --> 34:17.322
‐ Peacemaker actively
rejected me today.

34:18.790 --> 34:20.458
‐ You want me to frog‐barf
on her?

34:20.492 --> 34:22.193
(chuckling)
‐ Yes.

34:23.929 --> 34:26.398
I did manage to get my hands
on this stupid thing.

34:26.965 --> 34:28.533
Finding this scorned woman
is the only shot I have

34:28.567 --> 34:31.002
at getting my gun back.
But this...

34:31.835 --> 34:33.705
This could be anywhere, so...

34:33.737 --> 34:36.274
‐ Oh, well, that's Steve Gulch.

34:37.007 --> 34:39.643
‐ Who now?
‐ I once had to rescue

34:39.678 --> 34:40.978
these two guys named Steve,

34:41.012 --> 34:42.880
they fell there while
they were bouldering,

34:42.914 --> 34:45.417
and got stuck. Naked.

34:47.518 --> 34:48.887
‐ There are no good men left.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.388
‐ Mm, definitely
no good Steves.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.389
(gagging)

35:01.032 --> 35:04.002
(gagging)
‐ Jesus, Haught, should I‐‐

35:04.035 --> 35:05.437
‐ No, no, I'm good.

35:05.470 --> 35:07.439
I'm good, I just...
(pained groaning)

35:07.472 --> 35:09.975
I'm gonna just go check
on that cure.

35:13.678 --> 35:15.580
(door closing)
‐ Are you alright?

35:16.147 --> 35:17.582
‐ Better than Nicole.

35:20.619 --> 35:21.753
‐ We're almost done.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.489
We just have to let it simmer
for an hour and then...

35:25.790 --> 35:26.958
Babe?

35:27.826 --> 35:29.294
No!
‐ What are you doing?!

35:29.327 --> 35:31.029
‐ Oh, my God!
‐ I'm so sorry...

35:31.062 --> 35:33.164
‐ Oh! Quick.
Help me save some!

35:33.198 --> 35:35.567
‐ Yeah, okay.
(intense music)

35:40.005 --> 35:41.806
‐ You are certain
the gun was there?

35:42.340 --> 35:45.343
‐ Yeah. I could feel it.
I just couldn't make it come.

35:46.177 --> 35:47.345
That's what she said.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.484
I guess it makes sense,
I'm not...

35:53.685 --> 35:57.255
...the heir anymore,
now that the curse is broken.

35:58.089 --> 35:59.824
Or much of anything.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.359
(can clattering)

36:02.093 --> 36:03.528
‐ You are everything.

36:03.561 --> 36:07.298
‐ Wait, what did you mean,
at the museum,

36:07.332 --> 36:09.334
that I might not be proud
of Wyatt?

36:10.735 --> 36:13.905
‐ We were immortalized as heroes

36:13.938 --> 36:17.308
for murdering
a family of ne'er‐do wells.

36:19.110 --> 36:20.245
‐ The Clantons were dickheads.

36:20.278 --> 36:21.746
They took whatever they wanted,
they murdered people,

36:21.780 --> 36:24.983
stole their land.
‐ It was the Old West.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.985
The only difference
between them and us

36:27.018 --> 36:29.087
were the stars
pinned to our chests.

36:29.120 --> 36:31.956
I have often been left
to ponder, Wynonna...

36:32.557 --> 36:34.726
whether or not this legacy
of bloodshed

36:34.759 --> 36:36.661
will be the ruin
of everyone we love.

36:36.695 --> 36:39.030
Perhaps, we should take our cue

36:39.064 --> 36:41.666
from an ironically
named Buntline.

36:42.967 --> 36:45.603
Could be we should aspire to...

36:45.637 --> 36:46.471
make peace.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.742
‐ Oh, my God. Did everyone
take Gandhi pills this morning?

36:50.775 --> 36:53.178
(ominous music)

36:56.081 --> 36:57.649
What up, Kermit?

37:02.287 --> 37:03.955
What the hell, Bog Breath?!

37:04.889 --> 37:06.858
Ahh! Son of a‐‐

37:06.891 --> 37:08.460
Jesus. Squeeze harder!

37:09.294 --> 37:10.929
‐ Why are you fighting Nicole?!

37:10.962 --> 37:12.630
(both): She started it!
‐ What?

37:12.664 --> 37:14.132
‐ Look away, baby girl.
‐ Why?

37:14.165 --> 37:15.433
‐ 'Cause gingers are bleeders.

37:16.601 --> 37:18.336
‐ Wynonna!
‐ Well...

37:18.970 --> 37:20.338
‐ Babe.

37:21.639 --> 37:24.109
(growling)
‐ Come on.

37:26.811 --> 37:28.813
‐ Oh no. No, no, no.

37:28.847 --> 37:30.081
‐ What the hell was that?

37:30.715 --> 37:33.151
‐ The darkest of magics.

37:33.952 --> 37:34.953
‐ Well, that's it.

37:34.986 --> 37:37.889
Hide your kids, hide your wives!

37:37.922 --> 37:40.959
Because we are storming
the fucking castle.

37:40.992 --> 37:43.495
And by castle, I mean ranch!

37:43.528 --> 37:46.064
And by storming, I mean
we are putting the "kill"

37:46.097 --> 37:47.732
back in Kill‐lanton‐‐

37:47.766 --> 37:50.135
Can you not do that right now
during my rousing speech?

37:50.168 --> 37:51.836
I even just dropped an F bomb.

37:52.170 --> 37:53.638
‐ Those are my clothes.

37:53.671 --> 37:56.875
‐ The ones you were wearing
last night before bed.

37:56.908 --> 37:59.210
‐ They smell of gasoline.

38:07.185 --> 38:09.187
‐ I started the Homestead fire.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.289
‐ Let's go.

38:12.090 --> 38:13.992
‐ Wynonna.
You need Peacemaker.

38:14.025 --> 38:15.260
‐ We don't have time, Nicole.

38:15.293 --> 38:16.294
Look what they did to you.

38:16.327 --> 38:18.396
Look what they tried
to make you do to us!

38:18.429 --> 38:20.165
‐ Those creatures they have...

38:20.198 --> 38:22.734
Without Peacemaker,
this is a suicide mission.

38:24.469 --> 38:27.305
‐ I agree.
‐ Of course you do.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.675
‐ Look. Don't jump to Plan Z

38:30.708 --> 38:32.377
before we've even tried Plan A.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.345
‐ Which is what, exactly?
‐ We have to find the woman

38:34.379 --> 38:37.182
in the painting,
and bring her to the sanctuary.

38:37.215 --> 38:39.017
‐ Yeah. And then,

38:39.050 --> 38:41.052
if Peacemaker
doesn't show itself...

38:41.653 --> 38:43.755
Then we take on the Clantons,

38:43.788 --> 38:46.658
and their monsters, together.

38:47.058 --> 38:48.693
(sighs)

38:49.394 --> 38:51.296
‐ Fine. You go find some rope,

38:51.329 --> 38:52.197
'cause you're gonna
tie up your girlfriend.

38:52.230 --> 38:54.799
‐ Won't be the first time.
‐ Okay.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.135
‐ We need mount up
for the gulch.

38:58.636 --> 38:59.704
‐ Are you okay with this?

38:59.737 --> 39:03.074
‐ Well, I don't want you
to kamikaze yourself for me.

39:05.743 --> 39:07.078
‐ Let's go.

39:08.313 --> 39:11.049
(eerie music)

39:12.116 --> 39:14.285
(sighs)
‐ There is not much left.

39:14.319 --> 39:15.954
All of it
went down the sink.

39:15.987 --> 39:17.255
‐ Make it tighter.

39:17.922 --> 39:19.490
Waverly, it has to be tighter!

39:19.524 --> 39:20.725
‐ Well, I don't want
to hurt you.

39:20.758 --> 39:23.228
‐ Maybe just go get
the handcuffs from upstairs.

39:23.261 --> 39:25.597
(clearing throat)
‐ Okay. Good idea.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.835
(curious music)

39:32.136 --> 39:34.105
‐ No. No,
I'm not gonna do it!

39:38.176 --> 39:40.778
(cell phone ringtone)

39:56.527 --> 39:58.763
(sinister music)

39:58.796 --> 40:00.298
(shivers)

40:00.999 --> 40:02.166
‐ Hello?

40:04.035 --> 40:05.503
‐ Hey.
‐ Hey.

40:05.536 --> 40:07.872
They're here.
‐ Oh. Better let me.

40:07.906 --> 40:09.707
I'm the pro.
‐ Sure.

40:09.741 --> 40:11.609
‐ At least, I used to be.

40:18.016 --> 40:19.550
I just need you
to know one thing.

40:19.584 --> 40:21.819
‐ Okay.
‐ I love you, Waverly Earp.

40:21.853 --> 40:25.189
And no matter what happens,
those are the truest words

40:25.223 --> 40:27.158
I'll ever speak.
‐ Baby.

40:27.191 --> 40:28.860
(cuffs clicking)

40:29.494 --> 40:30.528
What the hell?

40:30.561 --> 40:32.864
What the hell?

40:32.897 --> 40:34.999
Nicole. Nicole!

40:35.033 --> 40:37.001
Jeremy, do something!
‐ I am!

40:37.035 --> 40:37.869
But you're not gonna like it!

40:37.902 --> 40:39.971
Wait, wait.
You're sure about this?

40:40.004 --> 40:41.773
You know we don't have
another choice.

40:42.674 --> 40:43.875
‐ No, no, no, no.

40:43.908 --> 40:46.177
‐ Yeah...
‐ No, no!

40:48.012 --> 40:50.515
Argh, I'm gonna kill you!

40:52.016 --> 40:54.118
‐ I gotta talk
to that softball league.

40:54.152 --> 40:55.253
(panting)
‐ Nedley...

40:55.286 --> 40:58.623
Okay, hey, before you say
anything, I am so, so sorry

40:58.656 --> 41:00.692
that I spent the last year
and a half trying to kill you.

41:00.725 --> 41:02.660
‐ Well, to be fair,
I was a puffball monster.

41:02.694 --> 41:04.429
And I did eat several
people's pets.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.030
‐ I should've known it was you.

41:06.064 --> 41:07.165
And I shouldn't have given up.

41:07.198 --> 41:09.233
Because that's what I did.
I gave up.

41:09.267 --> 41:12.337
‐ Nicole...
‐ Time and time again,

41:12.370 --> 41:14.939
you have been there for me.
And I let you down.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.841
I let everyone down.
But today,

41:16.874 --> 41:18.910
I'm going to change that.
‐ You need my help.

41:19.344 --> 41:21.045
‐ It's a big ask.
‐ Whatever you need.

41:21.446 --> 41:22.747
‐ I need you to kill me.

41:22.780 --> 41:25.550
(intense music)

41:30.154 --> 41:31.556
(Wynonna): You know,
I don't care how many Steves

41:31.589 --> 41:32.857
fell down here,
it's still a dumb name.

41:33.191 --> 41:36.861
‐ Well, finally something
we do agree on.

41:37.462 --> 41:38.629
‐ Don't get testy with me.

41:38.663 --> 41:41.599
You're the famous gunslinger
who's turned into Jane Fonda

41:41.632 --> 41:42.433
all of a sudden.

41:42.467 --> 41:45.636
‐ Well, her work‐outs
are sublime.

41:46.404 --> 41:47.872
(Wynonna sighs)

41:47.905 --> 41:49.540
‐ Being the Earp heir
is the only job

41:49.574 --> 41:51.342
I've ever had
that I was good at,

41:51.376 --> 41:53.411
besides strip club DJ.

41:53.745 --> 41:55.847
Just because you're rejecting
your legacy,

41:55.880 --> 41:57.548
doesn't mean
I have to reject mine.

41:57.582 --> 41:59.484
‐ A fine pair we are.
Blood on our hands,

41:59.517 --> 42:01.753
and both too stubborn
to wash them off.

42:02.653 --> 42:07.358
It appears we have found
our Woman Scorned.

42:07.392 --> 42:10.395
‐ Oy, lady!
You're coming with us!

42:10.428 --> 42:13.164
(intense music)

42:14.265 --> 42:15.733
(both): Rosita?!

42:20.438 --> 42:21.406
(Jeremy): No!

42:21.439 --> 42:23.408
Your survival instinct's
kicking in!

42:23.441 --> 42:26.077
(voices echoing)

42:26.110 --> 42:28.112
(intense music)

42:29.414 --> 42:31.983
(heartbeat pounding loudly)

42:32.016 --> 42:35.586
(speaking Latin)

42:40.591 --> 42:43.127
(Waverly): Jeremy!

42:49.200 --> 42:51.569
‐ Hey. I know how this looks,

42:51.602 --> 42:53.938
but I'm asking you
to trust us.
