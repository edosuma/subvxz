WEBVTT

00:13.907 --> 00:14.875
And were you all right?

00:14.908 --> 00:16.442
I mean you were never in
physical danger.

00:16.476 --> 00:18.112
I mean you had plenty to eat and
stuff

00:18.144 --> 00:21.115
and you know it was, we had
the big screen color TV.

00:21.147 --> 00:23.483
You watched everybody watch
the Super Bowl together, right?

00:24.518 --> 00:25.687
I wish, Dave, I wish.

00:26.821 --> 00:28.890
What will you do now,
are you famous now?

00:28.923 --> 00:29.891
I'm big time now, Dave.

00:29.924 --> 00:31.026
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:31.059 --> 00:32.661
Now will you
continue coaching at the Y

00:32.694 --> 00:33.662
or will do other things?

00:33.695 --> 00:35.830
I'm out of there Dave,
I'm about to blow up.

00:39.768 --> 00:41.603
About to blow up.

00:49.477 --> 00:53.381
Blow up, motherfucker you
imploded.

00:54.717 --> 00:58.521
Man, you were my idol growing
up,

00:58.554 --> 01:00.957
and now you're sittin'
across here from me.

01:00.991 --> 01:03.259
Do you know I cried when
you lost "Survivor"?

01:04.560 --> 01:06.963
And then just like you
disappeared.

01:06.997 --> 01:09.498
And now, now you're the number
one

01:09.532 --> 01:10.834
trending topic on Twitter.

01:13.403 --> 01:15.405
Now I need you to help me help
you.

01:17.407 --> 01:18.910
How did those guys get to you?

01:20.210 --> 01:21.846
Those guys didn't get to me.

01:24.581 --> 01:26.017
State
your name.

01:26.050 --> 01:27.051
Ray Martin.

01:28.019 --> 01:30.055
Did you kidnap Gervase?

01:30.089 --> 01:31.355
No.

01:31.389 --> 01:33.291
Kidnapping is a crime.

01:33.324 --> 01:35.226
You know what that means?

01:35.259 --> 01:37.228
It means when someone is
forcibly abducted

01:37.261 --> 01:39.630
or confined against their will.

01:39.665 --> 01:40.632
You know what a crime is?

01:40.666 --> 01:42.768
A crime is this coffee.

01:42.801 --> 01:44.403
Why'd you kidnap Gervase?

01:46.940 --> 01:48.240
I didn't kidnap Gervase.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.512
Tell me about the last 24
hours.

02:48.471 --> 02:50.908
Yesterday started
off like any other day,

02:50.941 --> 02:52.843
my dad asked me to meet
with him in the morning.

02:52.876 --> 02:53.844
He said, "It was important."

02:59.149 --> 03:01.251
Hybrid, oh, fuck.

03:01.285 --> 03:02.286
Can I help you?

03:03.854 --> 03:06.523
Hello, Hybrid Planet, can I.

03:14.966 --> 03:16.234
What's up dad?

03:16.267 --> 03:19.536
Oh, hey, Ray.

03:19.570 --> 03:21.040
How ya feelin'?

03:21.073 --> 03:22.975
Everything hurts all the time
as yoozh.

03:23.008 --> 03:23.976
I hear ya.

03:24.009 --> 03:25.277
What the hell's that noise?

03:26.344 --> 03:31.016
It's the air conditioning,
it's on its last legs.

03:31.050 --> 03:32.051
Just like me.

03:34.954 --> 03:37.257
Listen, I wanna run somethin'
by ya.

03:37.290 --> 03:39.491
Well, good 'cause I actually,

03:39.525 --> 03:41.560
I got somethin' I wanna run by
you.

03:41.594 --> 03:42.796
- Really?
- Yeah.

03:42.829 --> 03:44.030
You go first.

03:44.064 --> 03:48.869
Okay, it's official, I have
no idea what I'm doing here.

03:50.770 --> 03:53.406
I'm completely out of ideas

03:53.440 --> 03:55.843
and this place has clearly gone

03:55.877 --> 03:58.378
in the dumper as a result so,
so.

04:01.015 --> 04:01.983
So?

04:02.016 --> 04:05.019
We have a good deal of debt as
you know,

04:05.052 --> 04:10.058
and steady client base,
loyal, loyal customers

04:10.259 --> 04:12.493
but that's not enough to erase
the debt

04:12.526 --> 04:14.763
so if we don't turn things

04:14.796 --> 04:19.801
around really soon, like
yesterday we're fucked.

04:22.036 --> 04:26.776
And by we, I mean you.

04:26.809 --> 04:30.313
So this puppy it's all yours
pal.

04:32.048 --> 04:33.049
Whatta ya think?

04:34.350 --> 04:36.319
I'm just a driver, Dad.

04:36.352 --> 04:40.724
No, no, no, that's
it, I'm done, I'm tired

04:40.758 --> 04:42.960
and I have no more ideas.

04:44.895 --> 04:47.064
Look all I've done since your
mom died

04:47.097 --> 04:51.534
is just try to run this place

04:51.567 --> 04:56.041
and I've done it, I've run
it right into the ground so.

04:56.975 --> 04:58.575
I don't know anything about
running a business, Dad.

04:58.609 --> 04:59.978
Well clearly neither do I.

05:03.281 --> 05:05.317
Have you thought about an app?

05:05.350 --> 05:07.385
Yeah, I've been thinkin'
about chicken wings.

05:07.419 --> 05:08.386
- No.
- Like, no seriously.

05:08.420 --> 05:09.520
No, no, no.

05:09.553 --> 05:10.822
I've been
thinkin' about 'em all morning.

05:10.855 --> 05:12.892
No, how about updating the
website?

05:12.925 --> 05:15.627
Dude, I can't even answer my
phone.

05:15.661 --> 05:17.430
This son of bitch been
ringing all morning.

05:17.495 --> 05:18.630
I can't even answer it.

05:20.032 --> 05:21.367
I'm not even gonna
talk about advertising.

05:21.400 --> 05:23.402
You know let me just get to why
I'm here.

05:23.436 --> 05:24.403
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:24.437 --> 05:25.805
I've been thinking about
this for a few weeks.

05:25.838 --> 05:27.206
Good, 'cause I got nothing.

05:27.239 --> 05:28.541
- All right.
- So go.

05:28.574 --> 05:29.475
Here's the plan,

05:31.211 --> 05:32.813
I got a TV show idea

05:32.846 --> 05:35.581
where I interview
celebrities in our hybrids.

05:35.614 --> 05:39.618
Then we get advertisers to pay
to advertise on our website.

05:40.654 --> 05:41.487
Boom.

05:42.621 --> 05:46.194
I'm out of ideas but that's
fuckin' crazy that one.

05:46.227 --> 05:49.297
And you couldn't even
ask at better time,

05:49.330 --> 05:51.866
there's a movie convention
in town this weekend.

05:51.899 --> 05:53.935
I already have the GoPro set up,

05:53.968 --> 05:56.237
I know a hotel everyone's
staying at,

05:56.270 --> 05:57.571
I'm bound to get somebody.

05:58.806 --> 06:01.176
I'm bound to get some
wings, what do you think?

06:01.210 --> 06:02.011
Come on.
Yeah, that's fine.

06:02.044 --> 06:03.145
All right.
All right.

06:03.178 --> 06:04.480
Let's go to lunch.

06:18.495 --> 06:20.196
Hold on, that's my boss
calling.

06:21.731 --> 06:22.699
Hey.

06:22.732 --> 06:24.200
Summer, I'm over here
at the hotel right now

06:24.234 --> 06:26.302
I gotta do this interview
for "The Urban Yodeler".

06:26.336 --> 06:27.670
I don't even wanna do this
interview.

06:27.704 --> 06:29.305
They're talkin' about
doing an "Urban Yodeler 2"

06:29.339 --> 06:31.708
and they're gonna have
Denzel Washington do this.

06:31.741 --> 06:33.277
I wanna do "Urban Yodeler 2".

06:33.310 --> 06:34.278
This is a stupid shirt.

06:34.311 --> 06:35.746
I don't even know if I
wanna wear this shirt

06:35.780 --> 06:36.747
and I don't know where you,

06:36.781 --> 06:38.382
I need you here with me right
now.

06:38.416 --> 06:40.017
I need ya to get here now.

06:41.719 --> 06:42.686
Gervase Peterson.

06:45.322 --> 06:49.194
No, not Ricky Gervais, Gervase
Peterson.

06:50.395 --> 06:53.231
He was on the very first
season of "Survivor".

06:53.265 --> 06:54.766
He was huge.

06:54.800 --> 06:56.535
Gervase Peterson.

06:56.567 --> 06:58.403
Gervase Peterson.

06:58.437 --> 07:00.638
Yes, well there was a bit
of a dip but he's back.

07:00.672 --> 07:02.741
Perhaps you've heard of his
most recent feature film,

07:02.774 --> 07:04.043
"The Urban Yodeler".

07:04.977 --> 07:09.682
He's not a trained actor
but he, he has charisma.

07:09.715 --> 07:13.219
"Urban Yodeler", "Urban
Yodeler".

07:14.754 --> 07:16.956
He's it better than mediocre at
acting.

07:16.989 --> 07:19.292
He just stared in "The Urban
Yodeler".

07:19.325 --> 07:21.728
He just stared in "The Urban
Yodeler".

07:21.762 --> 07:22.963
He just recently filmed a
feature

07:22.996 --> 07:26.200
called "The Urban Yodeler",
perhaps you've heard of it.

07:26.233 --> 07:27.234
You haven't.

07:29.503 --> 07:31.872
No, not extra work.

07:31.905 --> 07:33.440
He's too big for that.

07:33.474 --> 07:34.741
He's a star.

07:34.775 --> 07:36.411
How much do extras get paid?

07:37.345 --> 07:39.814
Stand-in work is fine.

07:39.848 --> 07:40.815
Okay.

07:40.849 --> 07:41.850
Too-da-loo.

07:49.657 --> 07:54.629
Sweet Gervase, how could
life get any worse for you?

08:02.371 --> 08:03.339
Thank you.

08:03.372 --> 08:04.340
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:04.373 --> 08:05.341
- You got this.
- Yeah.

08:05.374 --> 08:06.809
Don't be a bitch.

08:08.111 --> 08:10.981
Leslie, what happened
to our first guest?

08:11.014 --> 08:12.782
He canceled.

08:12.816 --> 08:15.152
He canceled, you're just
telling me now.

08:15.185 --> 08:18.054
This the best you.

08:26.330 --> 08:30.535
Hi, ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to "Marquis Jackson Show".

08:30.568 --> 08:32.736
Our first guest was on
the mega hit "Survivor"

08:32.770 --> 08:34.772
not once but twice.

08:34.804 --> 08:37.808
Please welcome Gervasa Peterson.

08:39.309 --> 08:41.145
It's Gervase Peterson.

08:41.179 --> 08:42.147
Right.

08:42.181 --> 08:44.015
So tell me, what was it like
being naked

08:44.049 --> 08:45.217
on national television?

08:45.250 --> 08:47.052
You're there waving your junk
around,

08:47.085 --> 08:48.020
I know they blocked it out

08:48.053 --> 08:49.555
but it's gotta get cold
sometime, right.

08:49.588 --> 08:51.757
That can be embarrassing.

08:52.758 --> 08:54.927
No, no, no, that was Rich,

08:54.960 --> 08:56.664
the fat hairy naked guy.

08:56.696 --> 08:58.431
- Wow.
- Yeah, that wasn't me.

08:58.464 --> 08:59.432
Right, you know what?

08:59.465 --> 09:00.867
Let's throw all that out.

09:00.900 --> 09:01.901
What are you here to do?

09:01.935 --> 09:04.771
You're here to promote
"The Urban Yodeler".

09:04.804 --> 09:05.638
Yes.

09:07.473 --> 09:08.875
- "The Urban Yodeler".
- Yes.

09:08.908 --> 09:10.376
What a title.

09:10.410 --> 09:11.680
I didn't get a chance to watch
it.

09:11.745 --> 09:13.914
All right, full disclosure

09:13.948 --> 09:15.516
I couldn't get myself to watch
it.

09:15.549 --> 09:17.785
The premise is just ridiculous
to me.

09:17.818 --> 09:19.920
What's a black man know about
yodeling?

09:19.954 --> 09:21.021
Really?

09:21.055 --> 09:24.291
You don't yodel in the
urban section man, you rap.

09:24.325 --> 09:26.760
If you did urban rapper
I could understand that

09:26.794 --> 09:28.964
but urban yodeler, it's gonna be
a flop.

09:28.997 --> 09:31.199
I gotta tell you it's a
disgrace.

09:31.233 --> 09:32.067
I'm a disgrace.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.202
Yeah, I mean I'm being honest
here.

09:34.236 --> 09:36.404
Are you serious right now?

09:36.438 --> 09:37.305
What?

09:37.339 --> 09:39.107
You're gonna disrespect me
like that!

09:39.140 --> 09:41.343
I'm your third cousin twice
removed!

09:41.376 --> 09:43.613
I'm gonna have my mom call
your mom, how about that?

09:43.646 --> 09:45.314
Then whatta ya gonna do, huh?

09:45.348 --> 09:47.450
I'd like to be your third
cousin all the way removed.

09:47.483 --> 09:49.085
Fuck you, Marquis!

09:49.118 --> 09:50.553
You know this ain't 18 years
ago

09:50.586 --> 09:52.221
when I needed you, remember
that?

09:52.255 --> 09:54.490
When I asked you to help
me with that vape company.

09:54.523 --> 09:56.058
I came to you for a loan.

09:56.092 --> 09:57.426
You turned your back on me.

09:57.460 --> 09:58.261
It's a stupid idea!

09:58.294 --> 09:59.095
It's not a stupid idea.

09:59.128 --> 10:01.164
That was a stupid idea!

10:01.198 --> 10:03.133
It wasn't stupid, it was vape
pens!

10:03.166 --> 10:05.636
We both could have been
millionaires!

10:05.670 --> 10:07.337
I will see you at Thanksgiving!

10:07.371 --> 10:08.605
Oh, no you won't, no you
won't!

10:08.639 --> 10:09.439
I'm not comin'!

10:12.744 --> 10:14.578
Well ladies and gentlemen,

10:14.611 --> 10:16.514
I don't think he'll be getting a
rose.

10:17.782 --> 10:19.617
That's "The Bachelor"
motherfucker!

10:23.388 --> 10:25.790
So were you behind that, Avery?

10:26.824 --> 10:28.626
Well, you just had a melt down

10:28.660 --> 10:31.897
on live national television,
Gervase.

10:31.930 --> 10:32.766
Not good.

10:34.199 --> 10:36.502
And on top of that Denzel just
got signed

10:36.535 --> 10:37.704
for "Urban Yodeler 2".

10:39.004 --> 10:41.507
So we're pretty much
in the shit my friend.

10:43.409 --> 10:44.476
So I don't know what you're
doing

10:44.510 --> 10:47.614
but I'm going to keep on
drinking.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.249
- Hey, wait Avery.
- Yes.

10:49.282 --> 10:50.150
- Avery.
- Okay.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.018
- Avery.
- Thank you, Gervase.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.422
Goddammit doesn't anybody
say good-bye anymore?

11:06.200 --> 11:07.301
How's it going boss?

11:09.370 --> 11:11.272
Yo, Vanilla Ice make a move.

11:14.743 --> 11:16.143
Let's go, jipbag!

11:18.079 --> 11:19.981
I'll be, I'll be right back.

11:25.420 --> 11:28.924
Kevin Garnett in my restaurant.

11:28.957 --> 11:30.727
- No.
- Dude, this is Philly,

11:30.760 --> 11:32.928
I'm a Sixers fan but my son

11:32.961 --> 11:35.063
is a blow out, blow out Celtics
fan.

11:35.097 --> 11:36.466
- No, no, no, no.
- You don't understand.

11:36.499 --> 11:39.068
- No, no, no-
- Shh, shh, shh.

11:39.102 --> 11:41.003
You have soft, very soft lips.

11:41.037 --> 11:42.972
Can you take a picture for my
son?

11:43.005 --> 11:44.107
This is unbelievable.

11:44.140 --> 11:45.475
How's the pizza?

11:45.508 --> 11:46.342
You like a little salt?

11:46.376 --> 11:47.176
No, it's good.

11:47.210 --> 11:48.010
The pizza's great.

11:48.044 --> 11:48.878
Awesome.

11:48.911 --> 11:50.980
Wait, I'll get the, there ya go.

11:51.013 --> 11:51.982
He's gonna shit his pants.

11:52.015 --> 11:53.050
This is unbelievable.

11:53.083 --> 11:54.118
How long you in town for?

11:54.151 --> 11:56.019
Yo, I'm not Keven Garnett.

11:56.053 --> 11:57.856
I'm Gervase from "Survivor".

11:59.623 --> 12:00.457
You're not.

12:00.491 --> 12:02.426
- No.
- But your face

12:02.459 --> 12:05.028
it's just, it's so the same.

12:05.062 --> 12:07.064
I know, I get it all the time.

12:07.097 --> 12:08.666
Yeah, when I do this.

12:08.701 --> 12:10.168
Yeah, yeah, that's
what I'm talkin' about.

12:10.201 --> 12:11.136
I know.

12:11.169 --> 12:13.104
People say I look like
him but it's not me.

12:15.240 --> 12:16.776
I'm really sorry.

12:16.809 --> 12:18.778
That's cool, it's a nice hat
though.

12:18.811 --> 12:19.845
No way.

12:19.879 --> 12:20.679
Enjoy the pizza.

12:20.713 --> 12:21.546
Have a good day.

12:23.381 --> 12:25.484
This is the worst day ever.

12:25.518 --> 12:26.318
Wait, are you Gervase,

12:26.352 --> 12:27.854
are you the Gervase from
"Survivor"?

12:27.888 --> 12:28.755
Yeah.

12:28.789 --> 12:29.655
Can I sit down?

12:29.689 --> 12:31.090
Yeah, sure.

12:31.123 --> 12:32.859
This is my assistant Summer.

12:32.893 --> 12:34.360
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:34.393 --> 12:35.928
And that's when I met Ray.

12:35.961 --> 12:39.031
And that's when I met Gervase.

12:39.064 --> 12:40.233
I heard your name over there

12:40.267 --> 12:42.669
and I just felt like maybe
this was meant to be.

12:43.637 --> 12:44.638
I'm in a bit of a pickle.

12:44.671 --> 12:46.473
Okay, my dad owns a chauffeur
service

12:46.506 --> 12:48.141
and he's gonna lose his company

12:48.175 --> 12:50.110
'cause Uber is crushing him.

12:50.143 --> 12:51.645
So I came up with a show idea

12:51.679 --> 12:54.281
where every week I would
drive a celebrity in the car.

12:54.314 --> 12:55.483
Like
Seinfeld?

12:55.516 --> 12:57.853
Yeah, sort of like
Seinfeld but different.

12:57.886 --> 12:59.320
Now listen, I got lucky enough

12:59.353 --> 13:01.355
because this movie convention in
town

13:01.389 --> 13:03.057
and I got the kid from
"Rookie of the Year".

13:03.090 --> 13:03.926
Smalls?

13:03.958 --> 13:04.860
No, that's "The Sandlot".

13:04.893 --> 13:07.195
The other kid, he was in
"American Pie".

13:07.228 --> 13:08.663
Ah, Stifler.

13:08.697 --> 13:09.765
No, they other guy.

13:11.433 --> 13:13.435
The one who always bring
everyone together

13:13.469 --> 13:15.671
and you know always calls
his brother for advice.

13:15.705 --> 13:17.139
Thomas Ian Nicholas.

13:21.343 --> 13:23.445
Who's the most famous person you
ever met?

13:25.080 --> 13:27.852
I met Stallone once.

13:27.885 --> 13:29.452
I wanted to buy him a
drink but he said, "No."

13:29.486 --> 13:30.286
He was like, "No, thank
you, that's all right,

13:30.320 --> 13:32.322
don't worry about it."

13:32.355 --> 13:34.925
I was like, "I thought you love
almost everybody, you know."

13:36.025 --> 13:37.227
And then he was like, "All
right, stop doing that."

13:37.260 --> 13:38.328
So.

13:38.361 --> 13:39.462
He was my first interview,

13:39.496 --> 13:40.764
I didn't do too good with it.

13:40.798 --> 13:41.598
Are you filming this right
now?

13:41.631 --> 13:42.833
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:43.902 --> 13:44.803
Is that a problem?

13:45.937 --> 13:46.771
I mean.

13:47.806 --> 13:49.006
I'm sorry.

13:49.039 --> 13:51.041
He got out on the highway.

13:51.075 --> 13:53.644
He's small, there's cars,
there's trucks out there.

13:53.678 --> 13:54.746
That's neither here nor there.

13:54.779 --> 13:57.114
I'm here, he's there,
you're here in front of me.

13:57.147 --> 13:58.082
Not sure if you're aware

13:58.115 --> 13:59.283
but there's a movie convention
going on

13:59.316 --> 14:00.118
right about your head.

14:00.151 --> 14:01.219
- Yeah, I know.
- Okay.

14:01.253 --> 14:02.387
Listen, here's what I need,

14:02.420 --> 14:04.623
if there's any chance do you
know anybody

14:04.656 --> 14:05.791
that's signing up there?

14:05.825 --> 14:07.827
I mean, everybody's gonna be
up there.

14:07.860 --> 14:08.961
I'm gonna be up there.

14:08.995 --> 14:10.228
For what?

14:10.262 --> 14:11.764
Everything that I do.

14:11.797 --> 14:13.699
Okay, let me give you my card,

14:14.599 --> 14:16.803
if there's anybody you
can think of call me.

14:16.837 --> 14:18.504
I would go up myself but my
mind,

14:18.538 --> 14:21.674
I'm just on overload from
everything that happened

14:21.708 --> 14:24.277
and I'm honestly concerned
about little Tommy.

14:24.310 --> 14:25.913
Look, I got a better idea,

14:25.946 --> 14:28.147
there's a after party tonight at
Barnaby's

14:28.180 --> 14:29.615
and all the celebs are gonna
be there from the convention.

14:29.649 --> 14:30.751
- Okay.
- All you gotta do

14:30.784 --> 14:32.921
is go there, you're
bound to meet somebody.

14:34.288 --> 14:35.322
Is there like a list or
anything.

14:35.355 --> 14:36.623
Nah, nah, just walk right on
in.

14:36.657 --> 14:39.727
And look I mean I guess
if you're not gonna go

14:39.761 --> 14:42.496
and I see somebody I give
you a call or somethin'.

14:42.529 --> 14:43.630
I can't thank you enough.

14:43.664 --> 14:45.499
I really appreciate you, sir.

14:45.532 --> 14:47.035
I appreciate, thank you,
Gervais.

14:47.067 --> 14:49.270
Thanks, it's Gervase though.

14:49.304 --> 14:50.138
Take care.

14:52.875 --> 14:53.976
What are you fuckin' stupid?

14:54.009 --> 14:55.945
That's the perfect opportunity.

14:55.978 --> 14:57.012
I'm not doing that bullshit.

14:57.046 --> 14:58.313
That guy's an asshole.

14:58.346 --> 14:59.915
You forget about that
bomb of an interview

14:59.949 --> 15:02.116
or the fact that you
got shit canned today,

15:02.150 --> 15:03.217
do you remember that?

15:04.320 --> 15:05.354
Good point.

15:05.387 --> 15:08.357
Yep, damn good point.

15:08.390 --> 15:12.796
Fuck me.

15:12.829 --> 15:16.332
I mean three autographs in
three hours.

15:16.365 --> 15:17.834
You gotta do better than that
buddy.

15:17.867 --> 15:20.103
I know, Summer, I know.

15:22.339 --> 15:24.307
Aren't you that guy from
"Survivor"?

15:25.175 --> 15:26.543
Yeah, I am.

15:26.576 --> 15:28.111
Cool.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.346
What else you been in?

15:31.181 --> 15:32.750
A bunch of stuff.

15:32.783 --> 15:34.584
Yeah, yeah, a lot of
stuff, a lot of stuff.

15:36.021 --> 15:36.855
All right, I'm out.

15:36.888 --> 15:37.689
Ya outta here?

15:37.723 --> 15:38.522
Talk to ya later.

15:38.556 --> 15:39.490
All right, Summer.

15:41.827 --> 15:42.961
- Hey, crybaby.
- Yeah.

15:42.995 --> 15:44.328
- Take my seat.
- I will.

15:47.465 --> 15:48.599
Hey Ray, what's up man?

15:48.633 --> 15:49.600
What's up, buddy?

15:49.634 --> 15:50.902
Thanks for inviting me.

15:50.936 --> 15:52.337
Glad you made it
down, man.

15:52.371 --> 15:53.271
I did, thanks for the invite.

15:53.305 --> 15:54.139
Yeah, no problem.

15:54.172 --> 15:55.808
Any luck?

15:55.842 --> 15:57.309
Nah, you know what,
I didn't have any luck

15:57.342 --> 15:58.778
at the convention finding
anybody for you

15:58.811 --> 16:00.312
but you know what?

16:01.346 --> 16:02.214
I was looking at your card

16:02.247 --> 16:04.449
and I was about to give you
call, man.

16:04.483 --> 16:06.052
I'm gonna do your show.

16:06.085 --> 16:06.919
You'll do my show.

16:06.953 --> 16:08.421
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna do your
show.

16:08.454 --> 16:10.390
How about you do the show

16:10.423 --> 16:12.893
and then maybe we get somebody
bigger to do the show?

16:12.926 --> 16:14.995
- You know-
- Like with you or something.

16:15.029 --> 16:16.295
How about that?

16:16.329 --> 16:17.798
I mean, if you could find
somebody

16:17.831 --> 16:18.766
but you know you got me now.

16:18.799 --> 16:20.968
But you were supposed
to find me somebody.

16:21.001 --> 16:23.604
Excuse me barkeep, barkeep.

16:23.637 --> 16:24.638
What's up, bud?

16:24.672 --> 16:26.107
You guys serve raw eggs here?

16:26.141 --> 16:27.341
Ah, fuck my life.

16:27.374 --> 16:28.475
Raw eggs.

16:28.509 --> 16:30.078
Yeah, raw eggs, just got
done throwing some plates

16:30.111 --> 16:32.546
around at the gym and
need a little protein.

16:33.782 --> 16:36.084
Does this look like IHOP to
you, bud?

16:36.117 --> 16:37.886
No, looks like a nice bar.

16:37.919 --> 16:40.388
I'll just have a beer, anything
alcoholic.

16:40.422 --> 16:41.757
Yeah, that's a good choice.

16:43.625 --> 16:48.296
Oh, my God, if it
isn't Gervase Peterson.

16:48.329 --> 16:49.699
Holy cannoli, we are in the
presence

16:49.732 --> 16:52.367
of a pure acting genius.

16:52.400 --> 16:53.601
I love you, man.

16:53.635 --> 16:54.937
Oh my God.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.572
Thanks, I appreciate that.

16:56.605 --> 16:57.406
- How are ya?
- I appreciate that.

16:57.440 --> 16:58.842
Names Tanner, Tanner Murphy.

16:58.875 --> 17:00.811
Hey, nice to meet ya, Tanner
Murphy.

17:00.844 --> 17:02.611
That's a unique name Tanner
Murphy.

17:02.645 --> 17:03.479
It is kind of a unique name.

17:03.512 --> 17:06.148
Yeah, yeah, the stories of its
origins

17:06.183 --> 17:07.884
are quite fascinating as well.

17:07.917 --> 17:10.586
You see when I was born I
came out of my mom's crotch

17:10.618 --> 17:14.657
extremely tan, like I had been
baking in the sun for hours,

17:14.692 --> 17:16.393
I was tanner than all the other
babies

17:16.425 --> 17:17.327
in the maternity ward.

17:17.359 --> 17:18.528
I was practically black.

17:20.064 --> 17:21.263
Hence the name Tanner.

17:22.632 --> 17:25.602
Okay, that's a good one,
Tanner Murphy.

17:26.502 --> 17:28.741
I'm not sure why the shits
so funny 'cause it's true.

17:28.774 --> 17:29.607
Here we go.

17:31.043 --> 17:33.045
Oh my bad, man, I thought
you were just joking about-

17:33.078 --> 17:35.080
- So where are they hiding
all the good looking chicks,

17:35.114 --> 17:37.116
in the back of this joint or
something?

17:37.149 --> 17:38.150
I know you from somewhere.

17:38.183 --> 17:39.383
- Oh, my God, yeah.
- Hold on.

17:39.417 --> 17:40.485
- Yeah, you do.
- Don't tell me,

17:40.518 --> 17:41.352
don't tell me.

17:41.385 --> 17:43.790
I'm your brother-in-law ya
idiot.

17:43.823 --> 17:45.759
Ray, wait a minute, I
can't have a brother-in-law

17:45.792 --> 17:47.060
my parents aren't divorced.

17:47.093 --> 17:48.795
I am your sister's husband.

17:48.828 --> 17:49.729
- That's it.
- That's it.

17:49.763 --> 17:50.562
That's it.

17:50.596 --> 17:51.497
Yes, that's the one.

17:51.530 --> 17:52.832
Excuse me for a minute.

17:56.102 --> 17:56.903
Are you
serious that's you brother-

17:56.936 --> 17:57.737
- Yeah, that's my
brother-in-law.

17:57.771 --> 17:58.570
Can I get a beer?

17:58.604 --> 18:00.107
Give me a beer.

18:00.141 --> 18:01.574
- Coming up.
- Thank you.

18:05.278 --> 18:06.546
Yo, what are ya doing?

18:06.579 --> 18:07.815
Never heard of that
game.

18:07.848 --> 18:09.750
- No.
- That's the cheeky game.

18:09.784 --> 18:10.650
- The cheeky game.
- Yeah.

18:10.683 --> 18:11.584
Ya never played.

18:11.618 --> 18:14.088
What you do is you scour the
area, right,

18:14.121 --> 18:14.955
see a lot of strangers, right.

18:14.989 --> 18:16.457
- Right.
- And somebody you do not know

18:16.490 --> 18:18.526
you gotta go up to 'em, sneak up
to them,

18:18.559 --> 18:21.196
you put your cheek on their
back, okay.

18:21.229 --> 18:23.198
The person that leaves the cheek

18:23.231 --> 18:25.801
on the back of a stranger
the longest wins.

18:25.834 --> 18:26.835
- Great game.
- Fun.

18:26.868 --> 18:27.903
Are you serious?

18:27.936 --> 18:29.104
Yeah, yeah.

18:29.137 --> 18:30.906
Right now I'm not playin'
with anybody just practicing.

18:30.939 --> 18:32.175
He plays by himself.

18:32.208 --> 18:35.211
In order to master the craft
one really has to practice.

18:35.244 --> 18:37.579
- Don't touch me.
- You know what I'm saying?

18:37.612 --> 18:38.680
Man, I wanna play this game.

18:38.714 --> 18:40.216
- You wanna play this game?
- You don't wanna play.

18:40.249 --> 18:41.516
- No.
- Oh my, Gervase Peterson.

18:41.550 --> 18:44.419
Listen, listen, it's
all in the mind, right.

18:44.452 --> 18:46.989
Ya scour the room, look at the
room.

18:47.023 --> 18:49.226
The most unsuspecting person you
do it to.

18:49.259 --> 18:52.062
Sneak up, gotta be
quiet, ya gotta be quiet.

19:04.142 --> 19:05.310
Oh my God, he did it.

19:05.342 --> 19:06.311
Gervase!

19:06.343 --> 19:07.879
I can't believe I played the
cheek game

19:07.912 --> 19:08.880
with Gervase Peterson.

19:08.913 --> 19:10.148
Yeah, that's a cool
game.

19:10.181 --> 19:11.850
My buddies in my
wrestling fantasy league

19:11.883 --> 19:12.984
are not gonna believe this.

19:13.017 --> 19:14.052
Yeah, that's pretty cool man.

19:14.085 --> 19:16.721
Now, if you can hold
it a minute you win.

19:16.754 --> 19:17.922
A minute's the
record.

19:17.956 --> 19:19.424
Yeah, check out this chick.

19:21.260 --> 19:24.163
She's gonna get it, she doesn't

19:24.196 --> 19:25.764
Watch and learn my little Jedi.

19:27.365 --> 19:28.633

your dad picking us up.

19:53.995 --> 19:54.896
Listen, we're gonna have fun.

19:54.929 --> 19:56.264

20:02.270 --> 20:03.271

20:03.304 --> 20:04.437
Just open the door.
You had a hell of a day.

20:04.471 --> 20:05.907
We're gonna go out and play.

20:05.940 --> 20:07.009
Open the

20:07.042 --> 20:09.610
Open the door, open the door.

20:12.047 --> 20:13.282

21:00.531 --> 21:01.565

convention earlier man,

21:10.041 --> 21:11.911
signing pictures, so you know
just like to be prepared.

21:11.944 --> 21:13.145
Wishful thinking, wishful
thinking.

21:13.179 --> 21:13.980
Here's your
sandwiches.

21:14.013 --> 21:15.214
Thanks buddy, appreciate it.

21:15.247 --> 21:16.148
You're welcome.

21:16.182 --> 21:17.216
Hey find a good spot

21:17.249 --> 21:18.050

- Right here in the front.

21:18.084 --> 21:18.884
Come on, come on.

21:18.918 --> 21:20.820
- That spot right there.
- He will.

21:32.766 --> 21:35.102
Should I do one or two Gerv?

21:36.303 --> 21:38.005
Come on, Ray, you only live
once.

21:38.038 --> 21:39.206
Take 'em both.

21:39.239 --> 21:41.640
Actually,
you only die once,

21:41.674 --> 21:43.244
you live everyday.

21:49.150 --> 21:50.084
Was that?

21:51.853 --> 21:52.787
Nah.
Nah.

22:52.217 --> 22:53.218
Oh my God.

22:57.522 --> 22:58.356
Ray.

22:59.657 --> 23:00.492
Ray, honey.

23:01.760 --> 23:02.593
Ray!

23:04.063 --> 23:04.864
What?

23:04.897 --> 23:05.798
- Hi.
- What?

23:05.832 --> 23:06.899
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:06.933 --> 23:09.202
Hi, so you had fun last night.

23:09.235 --> 23:10.870
Mm-hmm.

23:10.903 --> 23:13.573
Who is the mysterious man
downstairs on our couch.

23:15.975 --> 23:18.144
What, what'd he look like?

23:18.177 --> 23:22.916
Well, he's tall, he's dark,
bald,

23:23.817 --> 23:25.651
probably handsome if he was
drooling.

23:27.754 --> 23:28.555
Ring a bell.

23:28.589 --> 23:29.957
Yeah, it does.

23:29.990 --> 23:30.891
That's Gervase.

23:31.892 --> 23:35.296
Okay, great, what's
he doing here, honey?

23:36.431 --> 23:38.733
I met Gervase yesterday
at the movie convention.

23:38.766 --> 23:41.402
He invited me to the after party

23:41.436 --> 23:44.671
and he could barely walk
or talk on the way out.

23:44.705 --> 23:45.773
And his assistant left him

23:45.807 --> 23:49.611
so me and my dad gave him a ride
home.

23:49.643 --> 23:52.414
That reminds me my dad,
I have to go to office

23:52.448 --> 23:54.950
and see if he can get my rides
covered.

23:54.984 --> 23:57.219
Anyway you can watch
Gervase till I get back?

23:58.854 --> 24:00.356
I need to get the rides covered,

24:00.389 --> 24:03.859
get back here, become
Gervase's good buddy,

24:03.893 --> 24:06.061
and then he'll do the show

24:06.095 --> 24:07.831
and get his friends to do the
show.

24:08.999 --> 24:10.367
And then everybody's happy.

24:11.535 --> 24:14.137
In case you forgot
we have three children

24:14.171 --> 24:16.072
and I have to get them ready for
school

24:16.106 --> 24:19.209
plus I have a ton of errands
to run today so sorry.

24:19.242 --> 24:20.877
I'll call your brother.

24:20.911 --> 24:22.012
Good luck with that.

24:23.314 --> 24:24.148
Thanks.

24:28.386 --> 24:30.154
All right, two out of three
falls.

24:30.188 --> 24:31.789
You were lucky last time.

24:31.822 --> 24:32.657
Here we go.

24:34.992 --> 24:36.727
Whatta ya think of that, huh,

24:36.761 --> 24:38.062

24:48.840 --> 24:50.209

24:50.242 --> 24:53.078

exercising.

24:54.146 --> 24:55.582
What do you want?

24:55.615 --> 24:58.651
Oh yes, Gervase, yes, I know him
well.

24:58.685 --> 24:59.953
Okay.

24:59.986 --> 25:01.588
You want me to come over and
watch 'em?

25:01.621 --> 25:02.488
Don't touch 'em.

25:02.522 --> 25:03.456
At all?

25:03.489 --> 25:05.558
Okay, all right, all

This is it Tanner.

25:14.635 --> 25:16.570
This is what you've
been waitin' for buddy.

25:17.705 --> 25:19.907
Don't fuck it up.

25:23.510 --> 25:24.678
Mom!

25:24.712 --> 25:26.915
Mom, where's my lucky tank top?

25:27.916 --> 25:32.921
Mom, Mom, where is my tank
top, my lucky tank top?

25:33.855 --> 25:36.358
She always leaves, I
never know where she goes.

25:36.391 --> 25:38.026
I need my lucky tank top.

25:54.745 --> 25:56.145
What's up, Dad?

25:57.913 --> 25:59.316
What are ya doing?

25:59.349 --> 26:04.054
Oh man, can you get my rides

26:05.322 --> 26:06.156
No sweat.

26:10.661 --> 26:12.863
Yeah, we're good.

26:12.896 --> 26:14.866

26:14.899 --> 26:15.700
Ya sure?

26:15.734 --> 26:17.001
Yes, yes, yes, no problem.

26:17.035 --> 26:20.505
Like I got fuck all else to do,

26:20.538 --> 26:22.540
Okay, cool, awesome.

26:22.573 --> 26:23.408
- Ray.
- Yeah.

26:26.110 --> 26:31.050
Look Ray, let me just
tell ya a little something

26:31.083 --> 26:33.787
I've been wanting to
share with you for awhile.

26:33.819 --> 26:37.923
You probably know that
we had five miscarriages

26:37.956 --> 26:39.793
before you were born.
Right.

26:40.693 --> 26:42.928
And you were premature, you
know,

26:42.961 --> 26:45.097
and we were worried to death.

26:45.964 --> 26:48.435
And when you were in the
incubator

26:48.468 --> 26:51.237
your mom slipped into a coma.

26:51.271 --> 26:53.973
She came to, obviously.

26:54.007 --> 26:54.809
Yeah.

26:54.841 --> 26:56.876
And she started praying
nonstop,

26:56.910 --> 26:59.646
just begging God, nagging him
frankly,

26:59.679 --> 27:02.315
she said, "That if she could
please live

27:02.349 --> 27:05.853
until you were 21 then he could
take her."

27:08.222 --> 27:09.523
She said that?

27:09.557 --> 27:10.391
Somethin' huh?

27:12.593 --> 27:13.561
Sweet isn't it?

27:13.594 --> 27:16.230
She died three months
after my 21st birthday.

27:16.263 --> 27:17.098
I know that.

27:19.334 --> 27:21.002
Why ya telling me this now?

27:21.036 --> 27:23.505
Well, I just thought you
should know

27:23.538 --> 27:28.410
that after all these years
you killed your mother.

27:29.378 --> 27:30.479
Oh my God, Dad.

27:30.512 --> 27:32.948
By turning
21 you killed your mother.

27:35.251 --> 27:36.185
Are ya done?

27:36.219 --> 27:37.920
All right, all right, all
right, no, no.

27:37.954 --> 27:40.824
You did however kill my wife.

27:40.858 --> 27:41.825
That-
I'm done with ya.

27:41.859 --> 27:42.860
All right.

27:42.892 --> 27:43.693
I'm done with ya.

27:43.726 --> 27:46.462
Cover my rides, all right.

27:46.496 --> 27:48.498
- I got ya covered.
- Yeah.

27:48.531 --> 27:50.133
Stop smokin' that shit.
Okay.

28:01.912 --> 28:03.680
Good morning sleepy head.

28:03.714 --> 28:04.548
Oh!

28:05.916 --> 28:07.152
Yo.
Hold on.

28:07.185 --> 28:08.486
Yo, yo where's my shirt?

28:08.520 --> 28:09.454
- Relax.
- Where's Ray?

28:09.487 --> 28:11.256
Relax, don't worry
about your shirt or Ray.

28:11.289 --> 28:12.957
Ray has hired me to look after
you.

28:12.991 --> 28:14.125
You cannot leave.

28:14.159 --> 28:15.593
Who the hell are you?

28:15.627 --> 28:16.796
It's me Tanner.

28:16.829 --> 28:19.130
No, no, get my shirt, find
Ray.

28:19.164 --> 28:21.533
No, no, I'm not getting
either, okay.

28:21.566 --> 28:25.337
And I have to warn you
I'm a lifelong WWF fan,

28:25.371 --> 28:26.773
if you move any closer

28:26.807 --> 28:28.974
I will be forced to Hulk Hogan
your ass.

28:29.008 --> 28:29.876
What the hell are
you talkin' about, man?

28:29.910 --> 28:31.177
Hulk Hogan was a bitch.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.378
What?

28:32.411 --> 28:33.345
Wait a minute, are you talking

28:33.379 --> 28:35.080
about the Hulk Hogan from WCW
with black,

28:35.114 --> 28:36.315
'cause then I'd probably agree
with you?

28:36.348 --> 28:37.884
'Cause yellow and red was
definitely not a bitch.

28:37.918 --> 28:39.386
No, the WCW Hogan was the dope
one,

28:39.419 --> 28:41.221
that WWF with the yellow was all
whack.

28:41.254 --> 28:42.355
What did you just say?

28:42.389 --> 28:43.690
You take that shit back!

28:43.723 --> 28:44.958
For what he was whack.

28:47.360 --> 28:48.930
Let's go, let's go.

28:48.962 --> 28:50.230
Won't take it back JYD,

28:50.263 --> 28:51.598

28:51.631 --> 28:52.999

- Me and you.

28:53.033 --> 28:54.702
Let's go.
Let's go.

28:57.238 --> 28:59.974
Oh, oh you know wrestling

29:02.376 --> 29:04.278

29:09.217 --> 29:11.420
has reportedly been kidnapped

29:36.847 --> 29:39.115
Dude, is that Gervase?

29:47.591 --> 29:50.127
Celebrities, that's it.

29:51.295 --> 29:54.498
I'll get a posse of
celebrities to rescue Gervase.

30:18.491 --> 30:20.293
I'm out here in my skivvies.

Where he brings the pizza.

30:27.266 --> 30:29.435
You know what, just open the
door.

30:29.468 --> 30:32.272
Thank God I got my clean undies
on today.

30:32.306 --> 30:33.140
This isn't funny!

30:34.042 --> 30:35.709
Ray will be home any minute!

30:35.743 --> 30:36.610
Hey, you're home.

30:37.946 --> 30:41.348
Ray, that son of bitch
ripped my pants right off me.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.051
Right off my fanny, Ray.

30:43.083 --> 30:45.185
And the doors locked, I can't
even get in.

30:48.690 --> 30:49.490
It was in there tight.

30:49.524 --> 30:51.459
Yeah.

30:51.492 --> 30:52.327
You have a change of clothes?

30:52.360 --> 30:53.161
Yeah, upstairs.

30:53.194 --> 30:54.063
The kids are gonna be home
soon.

30:54.128 --> 30:55.697
Please go upstairs.

30:59.334 --> 31:01.269
Ray, where you been man?

31:01.302 --> 31:02.471
What happened?

31:02.504 --> 31:04.707
I wake up I got this goofy
bastard starring at my face.

31:04.740 --> 31:05.541
Then he starts some shit with me

31:05.574 --> 31:08.011
and I had to whoop his fat ass.

31:08.044 --> 31:10.814
Let me piss, tell me all about
it.

31:14.183 --> 31:15.250
Hey, what's up, Avery?

31:15.284 --> 31:19.122
Gervase, turn on the
television right now.

31:19.155 --> 31:20.123
- Hey, Ray
- What?

31:20.156 --> 31:21.025
Turn the TV on.

31:24.694 --> 31:26.429
Gervase
Peterson is the number one

31:26.463 --> 31:29.100
trending topic on Facebook and
Twitter.

31:29.132 --> 31:30.500
People everywhere are showing

31:30.533 --> 31:32.103
their support for Peterson.
What?

31:32.135 --> 31:35.306
With the
hashtag stealing a survivor.

31:35.339 --> 31:38.142
Peterson's longtime
manager Avery Masterson.

31:38.175 --> 31:39.477
That is a handsome man.

31:41.278 --> 31:42.346
Right?
Right.

31:43.214 --> 31:44.116
We can say that, right?

31:44.148 --> 31:45.316
Oh yeah.

31:45.349 --> 31:46.150
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:46.183 --> 31:46.985
- Just two guys.
- Yeah, sure.

31:47.019 --> 31:48.686
Can recognize a guy's good
lookin'.

31:48.719 --> 31:49.921
You're everywhere Gervase.

31:49.955 --> 31:52.257
All over the news, Facebook,
Twitter, Instagram, everywhere.

31:52.290 --> 31:55.795
Gervase, you're trending for
the first time in 19 years.

31:56.996 --> 31:58.397
I don't know what you're doing

31:58.430 --> 32:00.232
but wherever you are can you
stay there

32:00.265 --> 32:03.201
for the next 24 hours
and not talk to a soul?

32:04.137 --> 32:05.303
I don't know.

32:05.337 --> 32:06.739
Just do it.

32:07.740 --> 32:11.577
Trust me, I have a plan to
get you back on top buddy.

32:12.946 --> 32:14.048
Stay put.

32:16.482 --> 32:17.350
Local police have
yet to-

32:17.383 --> 32:19.153
- That was manager Avery.

32:19.185 --> 32:19.987
What's up?

32:20.020 --> 32:20.821
We're investigating
all-

32:20.854 --> 32:22.255
- He wants me to stay here.

32:22.288 --> 32:23.424
- To the whereabouts-
- Why?

32:23.457 --> 32:26.061
- Mr. Peterson at this time.
- I'm trending.

32:26.094 --> 32:28.495
For what, why they even
think you're kidnapped?

32:28.529 --> 32:29.764
I don't know.

32:31.066 --> 32:32.901
I make the calls, I make the
calls.

32:35.136 --> 32:36.236
Hello, Rita.

32:37.538 --> 32:39.574
Yes, this is Avery.

32:39.607 --> 32:40.642
Is Tom Hanks home?

32:43.678 --> 32:45.547
Please tell him that Avery
called.

32:45.580 --> 32:50.585
Ms. Streep, you may not remember
me but.

32:52.654 --> 32:56.860
Tom, yes, Tom, I still have your
number.

32:56.893 --> 32:59.863
Hi Will, it's Avery from Improv
Group.

33:01.131 --> 33:04.201
Yes, and I am also calling you.

33:05.568 --> 33:08.905
Yes, and I need a favor.

33:08.939 --> 33:12.342
Tom, Tom Hanks, please don't
hang up.

33:12.375 --> 33:15.746
Look Meryl, I don't have
time to go into that now.

33:15.780 --> 33:17.514
I just need a favor.

33:17.547 --> 33:18.381
Dwayne.

33:21.052 --> 33:24.254
Yeah, I'm calling for that
favor.

33:24.287 --> 33:26.357
Yes, and the aliens are coming.

33:26.390 --> 33:28.626
Will, goddammit I just need a
favor.

33:28.659 --> 33:29.494
Ms. Streep.

33:30.728 --> 33:31.562
Gwyneth.

33:32.898 --> 33:36.034
Mr. Ferrell, Will.

33:36.068 --> 33:37.368
We'll
be keeping you updated

33:37.401 --> 33:39.138
as the story develops.

33:39.171 --> 33:40.973
Everyone on social media is
buzzing.

33:41.006 --> 33:43.308
- Rematch!
- Kidnap reality star Gervase-

33:43.342 --> 33:44.144
- Tanner!

33:44.177 --> 33:44.978
Oh shit!
Peterson.

33:45.011 --> 33:45.812
- Woo-
- Was attending.

33:45.845 --> 33:47.579
- Bitch!
- An after party last night

33:47.613 --> 33:49.182
when he was reported.

33:49.215 --> 33:50.382
Oh.

33:51.851 --> 33:53.219
I think that's Jeff Probst,

33:53.253 --> 33:55.922
the guy who lost all that
weight eating Subway.

33:55.955 --> 33:57.857
- The Subway guy.
- The Subway.

34:01.095 --> 34:06.066
Oh my, oh, this is terrible.

34:08.568 --> 34:09.735
Poor Gervase.

34:11.371 --> 34:12.405
I had no idea.

34:13.739 --> 34:15.743
Who is that brute?

34:15.777 --> 34:17.846
He should be arrested for his
hair alone.

34:19.313 --> 34:21.581
So you don't know the guy with
Gervase?

34:24.085 --> 34:26.687
Why haven't you released this
yet?

34:26.719 --> 34:27.922
Well,
you know we got other stuff,

34:27.956 --> 34:28.857
other leads we gotta look at

34:28.889 --> 34:31.092
and you know we're not TMZ or
anything.

34:31.127 --> 34:33.360
Right, because it would
make fast headlines then

34:33.395 --> 34:35.630
and we wouldn't want that yet,
would we.

34:35.664 --> 34:37.934
Could I have a copy of this?

34:37.967 --> 34:40.303
Actually no, you know police
procedure.

34:40.335 --> 34:41.938
You don't know the guy in there.

34:45.007 --> 34:47.811
No, I do not recognize
this other gentlemen

34:47.844 --> 34:50.346
but he should be pursued and
arrested

34:50.379 --> 34:52.348
as soon as humanly possible.

34:53.683 --> 34:54.851
Excellent, okay.

34:54.885 --> 34:56.320
So thanks a lot for your time

34:56.351 --> 34:58.255
and enjoy the rest of your day.

34:58.288 --> 34:59.755
Maybe just a screenshot.

35:01.591 --> 35:03.061
Nah, look here's the thing,

35:03.094 --> 35:04.062
we can't release the tape

35:04.095 --> 35:06.898
because you know it's
evidence technically so

35:06.931 --> 35:08.365
if we violate any evidence
and stuff like that,

35:08.398 --> 35:09.934
you know we can get in trouble.

35:09.968 --> 35:11.435
So you know it's not you, it's
us.

35:11.468 --> 35:12.536
You ever see "Law & Order"?

35:12.569 --> 35:14.138
You know how they don't do any
extra work

35:14.172 --> 35:15.006
than they kinda of have to.

35:15.039 --> 35:16.908
So just if you don't mind,

35:16.941 --> 35:19.577
give me my phone if you
mind please, if you don't.

35:19.611 --> 35:20.445
Thank you.

35:22.114 --> 35:24.382
We'll be on our way Mr.
Masterson.

35:25.284 --> 35:27.086
And we got stuff to do.

35:27.119 --> 35:29.088
Let's go partner, we're double
parked.

35:33.458 --> 35:34.294
Yes.

35:36.796 --> 35:40.000
I'm gonna tell you this
one time and one time only,

35:41.902 --> 35:43.169
I'm a Gervase fanatic.

35:44.436 --> 35:47.406
I don't go to sleep without
puttin' my tiki light out.

35:48.674 --> 35:52.880
But something in here
stinks in my nostrils.

35:54.481 --> 35:55.515
And I think it's you.

35:57.684 --> 36:01.155
So motherfucker if you had
anything to do with this shit

36:02.924 --> 36:04.892
I'm gonna come for your ass.

36:13.434 --> 36:16.238
Look, you gotta relax.

36:16.271 --> 36:18.974
I got 37 days left till
retirement.

36:19.007 --> 36:21.910
From here on out let's
play by Vince's rules.

36:21.944 --> 36:25.714
Okay, number one we
don't chase after anybody

36:26.615 --> 36:28.918
that's why we got the car and
the radio.

36:28.952 --> 36:32.088
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't
know if you can tell or not

36:32.121 --> 36:33.423
but I've been in the gym.

36:33.455 --> 36:35.325
Yeah, I'm ready for all
that physical action.

36:35.358 --> 36:36.692
Matter of fact, I was thinking
you and I

36:36.725 --> 36:38.395
can be like new the "Bad Boys".

36:38.429 --> 36:41.131
No, no, listen I can't
be runnin' after anybody.

36:41.165 --> 36:43.767
You know I got plantar
fasciitis in both feet.

36:45.302 --> 36:46.437
What?

36:46.469 --> 36:49.539
It's a thing where your
arch kinda, google it, okay.

36:49.572 --> 36:54.145
Number two, my coffee,
one cream, one Splenda,

36:54.179 --> 36:55.546
that's the yellow packet.

36:56.414 --> 37:00.151
Most importantly, make
sure before every shift

37:00.185 --> 37:03.221
our car has a full tank of gas.

37:03.254 --> 37:05.723
I want that tank right on F.

37:08.093 --> 37:08.927
Why?

37:08.960 --> 37:10.096
Because we don't wanna run out
of gas

37:10.129 --> 37:11.831
when we're chasin' after
somebody.

37:12.664 --> 37:16.402
Why do you think OJ drove
so far in the Bronco,

37:16.435 --> 37:19.138
all afternoon he drove, you know
why?

37:20.773 --> 37:22.074
Full tank of gas.

37:38.724 --> 37:40.227
It's right here.

37:45.233 --> 37:47.802
Look fellas, we don't need
to do this man, I'm okay.

37:47.835 --> 37:49.603
No, no, you gotta let
me make this right dude.

37:49.636 --> 37:51.439
I'm the one that dropped you
okay.

37:51.472 --> 37:53.107
I'm sorry I snuck ya, had to do
it.

37:53.141 --> 37:54.942
- Okay, Tanner.
- Had to show you what's up.

37:54.976 --> 37:57.644
Okay, this guy's gonna make
everything better, all right.

37:57.677 --> 38:00.516
I play bocce ball with this
guy, he's awesome, okay.

38:00.548 --> 38:01.350
How do you know him?

38:01.383 --> 38:02.518
I played bocce ball with him.

38:02.550 --> 38:03.352
- Oh great.
- Now listen-

38:03.385 --> 38:04.253

38:04.286 --> 38:05.788

38:07.890 --> 38:10.658
But listen I'm really sorry I

38:10.691 --> 38:12.261
I mean you went down hard, man.

38:12.294 --> 38:13.962
You went down like sack of
potatoes.

38:13.997 --> 38:15.065
Okay, Tanner.

38:15.098 --> 38:17.000
I mean really I knew I was
strong

38:17.033 --> 38:18.134
but I didn't know I was that
strong.

38:18.168 --> 38:18.968
- Tanner.
- That was incredible.

38:19.002 --> 38:19.803
- Tanner.
- Oh dude,

38:19.836 --> 38:21.004
I'd broke your neck.

38:21.037 --> 38:22.172
- We get it.
- Sorry.

38:22.205 --> 38:23.273
We definitely get it, Tanner.

38:23.306 --> 38:24.207

39:09.489 --> 39:11.324

Not bad, huh?
That's pretty good, man.

39:24.670 --> 39:26.039

39:28.842 --> 39:29.910
Not allergic to anything.

This is from the craters of
Peru.

39:44.859 --> 39:45.692
Is that gonna help him?

39:45.726 --> 39:47.728
Rosemary, juniper, no, this is
just,

39:47.761 --> 39:49.264
the forced air really dries me
out.

39:49.297 --> 39:50.366
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah, no.

39:50.399 --> 39:52.734
All right, all right, I'm
just gonna get in here.

39:52.767 --> 39:53.569
Don't get, easy.

39:53.602 --> 39:55.938
All right, all right, easy does
it.

39:55.971 --> 39:57.206
Don't be weird.
It's all right.

39:57.239 --> 39:58.773
Don't be weird, it's easy.

39:58.807 --> 40:00.209
Everything's
gonna be all right.

40:00.242 --> 40:01.743
All right.

40:01.777 --> 40:03.145
I sense a lot of fear.

40:03.179 --> 40:04.213
- Yeah.
- Maybe a little shame

40:04.246 --> 40:05.614
in there, huh.

40:05.648 --> 40:07.117
That right side real tight.

40:07.150 --> 40:09.085
I'll tell you what, what you
just drank

40:09.119 --> 40:12.522
is gonna wash over you
like a warm blanket my man.

40:12.556 --> 40:13.990
It's gonna put ya into a little
place

40:14.024 --> 40:15.258
I like to call twilight.

40:16.226 --> 40:18.128
Okay, what you've taken my
friend

40:18.161 --> 40:22.400
is a combination of narcotics
and a little softener,

40:22.433 --> 40:24.869
a little ex-lax, just to soften
the blow.

40:24.902 --> 40:26.404
It's not gonna run through ya
too quick

40:26.437 --> 40:28.673
but you might spend a
little time on the potty.

40:28.705 --> 40:32.009
In an hour or so you'll be
right as rain, all right.

40:32.043 --> 40:32.843
There she goes.

40:32.877 --> 40:34.512
Looks like he's going.

40:34.545 --> 40:35.513
There you go.

40:35.546 --> 40:40.352
All right, steady as she
goes, sweet dreams, bud.

40:42.120 --> 40:43.655
Where do I know this dude from?

40:44.523 --> 40:46.024
Who is this guy, what's going
on?

40:46.058 --> 40:47.059
You didn't hear?

40:47.092 --> 40:48.393
What, what do we got cooking?

40:48.427 --> 40:49.228
You don't know who

40:49.261 --> 40:50.796
You said Gervase.

40:50.829 --> 40:51.630
Gervase Peterson

40:51.663 --> 40:52.464
"Survivor".

40:52.497 --> 40:53.532
- "Survivor".
- "Survivor".

40:53.565 --> 40:54.367
Gervase Peterson.

40:54.400 --> 40:55.268
I know I recognized him.

40:55.301 --> 40:56.502
I thought he was tax man or
something.

40:56.536 --> 40:58.404
Yeah, no, no, he's still
going.

40:58.438 --> 41:00.807
Well, anyway everybody
thinks he's kidnapped,

41:00.840 --> 41:01.975
it's all over the news.

41:04.711 --> 41:05.878
Why do they think he's
kidnapped?

41:05.912 --> 41:07.614
I have no idea but they do.

41:07.647 --> 41:10.251
Tan Man, did you kidnap him?

41:32.741 --> 41:34.209

cargo from here to Peru.

41:44.186 --> 41:45.187
- Cargo.

41:45.221 --> 41:46.922
He can't be cargo, he's

41:46.956 --> 41:48.524
Yeah, he can ship Gervase.

41:48.557 --> 41:49.358

Hello, gentleman, can I help

46:35.796 --> 46:39.099
Sorry to bother you, sir,

46:39.132 --> 46:42.436
Would you mind coming down to
the station for a little bit?

46:42.469 --> 46:44.638

46:44.671 --> 46:45.808
Like you don't' know.

46:47.108 --> 46:49.044
One of your vehicles was used

46:49.078 --> 46:50.846
in a possible crime last night.

46:53.281 --> 46:54.616
Oh boy.

46:54.649 --> 46:55.884

You gotta be kidding me?

47:21.846 --> 47:25.715
No, jackass here used his
own personal cell phone.

47:25.749 --> 47:27.885
What the hell is the fat man
wearing?

47:27.918 --> 47:29.185
I believe that's a romper.

47:29.219 --> 47:32.455
Oh God,

47:33.557 --> 47:35.861
I'm no fashionista but
he's kinda wearin' it.

47:35.894 --> 47:36.962
I tried to get in a romper
once

47:36.995 --> 47:39.097
but they had to cut me out of
it.

47:39.131 --> 47:40.665
Do you remember when Sean
Connery

47:40.698 --> 47:42.901
wore the romper in "Goldfinger".

47:42.934 --> 47:43.869
Oh, you're taking me back.

47:43.902 --> 47:45.536

47:50.542 --> 47:51.610
- Get out of here.

47:51.643 --> 47:52.477

drove home the other night.

48:10.898 --> 48:12.565
So you admit you kidnapped
him?

48:14.200 --> 48:15.635
What did you do to Gervase?

48:15.668 --> 48:16.937
We didn't kidnap him.

48:16.970 --> 48:19.505
We, he was drunk frankly,

48:19.539 --> 48:20.773
we gave him a ride home.

48:20.808 --> 48:22.309
We thought we were being nice.

48:23.945 --> 48:25.080
Mr. Martin, are you telling me

48:25.113 --> 48:26.380

48:28.248 --> 48:30.185
No, I don't watch the news.

48:31.186 --> 48:35.123
My TV broke and my kid
bought me a Smart TV

48:35.156 --> 48:39.360
and I'm frankly too dumb to use
it so no.

48:42.932 --> 48:45.567
Would you be willing to
give us your son's address?

48:46.668 --> 48:48.170
Is he gonna get in trouble?

48:48.204 --> 48:49.370
I'm not sure, sir,

48:49.404 --> 48:52.007
but we gotta figure this out.

48:52.041 --> 48:55.578
Yeah, Mr. Martin, you, you
stay here.

48:57.780 --> 48:59.482
Okay, all right.

48:59.515 --> 49:01.017
Gervase better be okay.

49:11.661 --> 49:13.064
Finally.

49:13.097 --> 49:14.031
- All right.
- Got they asses now.

49:14.065 --> 49:15.298
Here we go.

49:18.936 --> 49:20.537
Tell me you're out of gas again.

49:22.974 --> 49:26.211
I bet if Gervais was there
pumping gas over in Jersey

49:26.245 --> 49:27.212
you woulda stopped and got it.

49:27.246 --> 49:28.279
It's Gervase.

49:28.312 --> 49:30.281
Gervase, Gervais, oh my God.

49:30.314 --> 49:31.150
Oh my God.

49:33.085 --> 49:34.418
All right, call for backup.

49:38.656 --> 49:41.660
What a day, dude, what a day.

49:41.693 --> 49:42.528
I know.

49:44.130 --> 49:46.199
Hey, is everything cool with
Andrea?

49:46.232 --> 49:47.233
Yeah, now she's all right,
man.

49:47.267 --> 49:48.234
I calmed her down.

49:49.468 --> 49:50.870
How about you?

49:50.904 --> 49:52.437
I hope everything's all right
with you.

49:53.873 --> 49:55.108
I mean we'll see.

49:55.141 --> 49:57.710
I hope this all works out,
brother.

49:57.744 --> 49:59.847
Hope it works out for you too,
man,

49:59.880 --> 50:01.581
you and your dad and the
business.

50:02.682 --> 50:05.385
You know I remember when I was
acting

50:05.418 --> 50:07.520
and you were big on "Survivor"
that year

50:07.554 --> 50:10.623
and I saw on the TV that
you were on "Nash Bridges"

50:10.657 --> 50:12.159
and you got shot in the ass

50:12.193 --> 50:12.993
and I was pissed

50:13.027 --> 50:14.262
because I was working my ass off

50:14.296 --> 50:15.396
tryin' to be an actor.

50:15.429 --> 50:16.730
And they were just throwing a
bones

50:16.764 --> 50:18.834
like left and right all the
time.

50:20.467 --> 50:22.603
And I put everything on
hold when my mom died,

50:22.636 --> 50:24.906
everything for my dad.

50:28.009 --> 50:32.315
I just never had the
opportunity to live my dream.

50:39.188 --> 50:40.689
I miss my mom so much, man.

50:42.791 --> 50:44.994
Her name was Peachie,
her real name was Carol

50:45.027 --> 50:47.396
but everybody called her
Peachie.

50:47.430 --> 50:50.366
Even when she was sick,
a month before she died

50:50.399 --> 50:52.269
went to the movies to see "Down
to Earth",

50:52.302 --> 50:55.038
I had a small part where I ate a
hotdog.

50:55.072 --> 50:56.706
She was so sick by the time she
got up

50:56.739 --> 50:59.910
to say, that's my son, Chris
Rock was back on the screen.

51:01.745 --> 51:03.714
People were like, what's
wrong with that lady?

51:04.681 --> 51:05.850
I just miss it.

51:05.884 --> 51:09.686
But I wanna do my own thing,
I wanna live my dream,

51:09.720 --> 51:10.889
and I wanna ask questions.

51:10.922 --> 51:12.789
I wanna bring stuff out of
people.

51:14.158 --> 51:17.495
Like for you here's a
question I would ask ya,

51:17.528 --> 51:18.931
when you were at your height

51:19.899 --> 51:21.033
did you ever still walk into a
room

51:21.066 --> 51:23.401
and feel like nobody knew who
you were?

51:25.637 --> 51:28.140
Of course, man, think
that happens to everybody.

51:30.276 --> 51:32.810
I mean I remember this
one time I was in L.A.,

51:32.845 --> 51:34.881
I went to this huge house party

51:35.748 --> 51:39.019
and I get in there and in that
corner

51:39.052 --> 51:41.121
is Hugh Hefner and the seven
girlfriends,

51:41.154 --> 51:43.422
this corner over here is P
Diddy,

51:43.455 --> 51:44.891
the Lakers are over there,

51:46.126 --> 51:48.828
Tommy Lee and Pam Anderson
in the other corner.

51:48.862 --> 51:50.730
And I see Sam Jackson and Chris
Tucker

51:51.765 --> 51:53.901
and I'm a huge Sam Jackson fan.

51:53.935 --> 51:55.769
So I go over to him and I'm
like,

51:55.802 --> 51:56.837
"Hey Mr. Jackson, I'm."

51:56.871 --> 51:59.307
And he's like, "I know
who you are motherfucker!"

52:00.640 --> 52:02.776
Like Sam Jackson knew who I was.

52:02.809 --> 52:05.513
- That's awesome, man.
- Yeah man, it's pretty crazy.

52:06.514 --> 52:09.583
Being that you did all that
stuff and you were famous

52:09.617 --> 52:10.518
do you ever think about that

52:10.551 --> 52:11.452
when you're laying in bed at
night

52:11.485 --> 52:15.424
like how was there and now I'm
here?

52:15.456 --> 52:17.326
Like where'd it all go?

52:18.327 --> 52:20.896
I mean, look man everybody's
got a story to tell.

52:20.929 --> 52:24.334
You know like my mom had
Alzheimer's, you know.

52:24.367 --> 52:25.935
- She did.
- Yeah.

52:25.969 --> 52:28.438
You know same thing I
had to move back home

52:28.470 --> 52:30.206
and take care of her.

52:30.239 --> 52:31.606
But you know I was fortunate
enough

52:31.640 --> 52:33.508
to keep things going.

52:33.542 --> 52:34.877
You know a lot of people think

52:34.911 --> 52:37.513
that I was just given things,

52:37.547 --> 52:38.882
I caught a break 'cause I did
"Survivor"

52:38.916 --> 52:40.985
but I earned everything that
I've got

52:42.152 --> 52:44.855
and everything I've been
through I worked hard for.

52:44.888 --> 52:46.656
And it's like anybody else man,

52:46.689 --> 52:48.325
you know once you hit the top

52:48.359 --> 52:50.361
the only place to go is down
from there.

52:53.898 --> 52:55.699
I just hope it all works out,
man.

52:56.901 --> 52:58.303
I do too, man.

52:58.336 --> 53:00.771
I appreciate you and I'm glad
I met you.

53:01.973 --> 53:04.409
I guess everything happens
for a reason, right.

53:04.442 --> 53:05.877
That's what they
say.

53:07.979 --> 53:10.049
I'm gonna close my eyes
now for a little bit, man.

53:12.284 --> 53:17.289
That's not a bad idea.

53:35.108 --> 53:37.978
Gerv, we fell asleep, buddy.

53:40.847 --> 53:42.383
You got a red dot on your head.

53:43.784 --> 53:45.453
You got a red dot head
on your forehead too.

53:45.486 --> 53:47.488
- What?
- Hands up dickheads!

53:47.522 --> 53:49.257
Above your asshole!

53:49.290 --> 53:50.925
- Oh my god!
- Yo, yo!

53:50.958 --> 53:51.926
Does that have anything to do

53:51.959 --> 53:53.361
with the kid from "American
Pie"?

53:53.394 --> 53:54.195
Shut your mouth!

53:54.228 --> 53:55.196
Is he still alive?

53:55.229 --> 53:56.663
I didn't do anything.
Yo what's going on?

53:56.696 --> 53:59.268
He jumped out of
the car all on his own.

53:59.301 --> 54:00.335
We got you.

54:00.369 --> 54:02.204
Get you away from this
Buffalo Bill motherfucker.

54:02.237 --> 54:03.038
What's going on?

54:03.072 --> 54:04.239
What's happening?

54:04.273 --> 54:06.475
We come to arrest
him, get ya out of here.

54:07.543 --> 54:09.610
Don't worry, I got my special
blanket,

54:09.644 --> 54:11.646
it only has one crusty corner.

54:11.679 --> 54:12.780
I got more in the car.

54:13.749 --> 54:15.452
What you talkin' about?

54:15.485 --> 54:16.419
Gervase!

54:16.453 --> 54:17.786
What the
fuck is going on here?

54:17.820 --> 54:21.491
Gervase, there's
policeman and press outside

54:21.524 --> 54:22.758
and Summer's been on her phone
all day,

54:22.791 --> 54:26.529
and you are trending on every
social media that there is.

54:26.563 --> 54:28.730
You're back on top, buddy!

54:28.764 --> 54:30.401
Back on top!

54:30.434 --> 54:33.070
You just saved your own career.

54:33.104 --> 54:36.907
We are gonna do big things
together, big things!

54:36.941 --> 54:37.942
That was not sexual.

54:40.010 --> 54:40.845
Hey, Summer.

54:42.246 --> 54:43.713
Whew, what a dump.

54:44.982 --> 54:46.985
I don't remembering eating that.

54:47.018 --> 54:49.955
Can smell thing, hey
where are you guys going?

54:49.988 --> 54:51.256
What-
Oh, no, there's one more,

54:51.289 --> 54:52.756
there's one more!

54:52.790 --> 54:54.259
Hello, how are you?

54:54.292 --> 54:55.093
Good, how are you?

54:55.127 --> 54:56.061
What's your name?

54:56.094 --> 54:56.895
Summer.

54:56.928 --> 54:58.063
Summer, I'm Tanner.

54:58.096 --> 54:58.897
Hi, Tanner.

54:58.930 --> 54:59.763
You like wrestling?

54:59.797 --> 55:00.932
Oh, absolutely.

55:00.966 --> 55:01.834
Come over my parents house

55:01.868 --> 55:03.269

55:03.302 --> 55:04.103
Okay.

55:04.137 --> 55:05.138

55:05.171 --> 55:06.239
Thank you so much.

55:06.272 --> 55:09.275
Rochester Big and Tall

55:09.308 --> 55:11.110
Hey, email me, okay.

I think I love you.

55:59.528 --> 56:00.496
Summer Andrews.

56:00.529 --> 56:02.097

56:02.131 --> 56:05.168
Tanner, Tanner Murphy, two
N's, one T.

56:05.202 --> 56:06.369
Have you ever been arrested?

56:06.403 --> 56:07.770
No, I never been arrested.

56:07.803 --> 56:09.805
This is great, I never
been in one of these.

56:09.839 --> 56:11.308
Have you ever been arrested?

56:11.341 --> 56:14.077
Yeah, I've been a bad girl.

56:14.110 --> 56:15.078
Have you ever been arrested?

56:15.111 --> 56:17.080
Arrested, no, no, no,
I don't get arrested.

56:17.113 --> 56:20.116
I've never, I'm a big fan
of "Cops", love the show.

56:20.150 --> 56:22.119
Describe your relationship
with Gervase.

56:22.153 --> 56:23.921
Professional, he's great.

56:23.955 --> 56:26.023
You ever see the episode
where the guy stole the cop car?

56:26.057 --> 56:27.091
He's wife chased him down,

56:27.124 --> 56:28.392
you guys couldn't get 'em.

56:28.426 --> 56:31.195
And remember he ran, he got away

56:31.229 --> 56:32.729
but that doesn't matter.

56:32.762 --> 56:34.731
Gervase, did I see him on the
news?

56:34.764 --> 56:35.566
Are you kiddin' me?

56:35.600 --> 56:37.135
This guys all over the place.

56:37.169 --> 56:38.803
I shoulda let him keep the damn
hat.

56:38.836 --> 56:41.039
It wouldn't been
incredible for my business.

56:41.073 --> 56:43.242
Speaking of business,
do you like meatballs?

56:43.275 --> 56:46.011
Goddamn, got old.

56:46.044 --> 56:46.845
He looks like shit.

56:46.878 --> 56:48.013
I got a meatball sandwich.

56:49.147 --> 56:50.382
It'll knock your socks off.

56:50.415 --> 56:52.017
Did you kidnap Gervase?

56:52.050 --> 56:54.721
No, but I'd love to kidnap
you.

56:54.753 --> 56:56.356
Did you kidnap Gervase?

56:56.389 --> 56:57.557
No.

56:57.590 --> 57:00.293
I turned my back for one
second he takes the tincture.

57:00.326 --> 57:02.095
The tincture is meant for
sipping.

57:02.128 --> 57:04.430
It will relax his muscles
and help him quite a bit.

57:04.464 --> 57:07.100
He took the whole thing,
he's probably dead.

57:07.133 --> 57:08.534
Start from the beginning,
Gervase.

57:08.568 --> 57:10.337
Tell me about the last 24 hours.

57:10.371 --> 57:12.273
Yesterday was my first
interview

57:12.306 --> 57:14.408
for a movie I'm not even proud
of.

57:14.441 --> 57:16.844
Did you ever get enjoyment
from tying people up?

57:16.877 --> 57:18.379
Handcuffs are more my thing.

57:18.412 --> 57:19.580
I was Tanner's phone call,

57:19.613 --> 57:21.315
he called me, said, "He was in
jail."

57:21.348 --> 57:22.249
I ran right down.

57:24.652 --> 57:26.688
So I'd like to be put in a cell
with him.

57:26.721 --> 57:27.889
I think I killed Gervase.

57:27.922 --> 57:29.090
Did I kill Gervase?

57:29.124 --> 57:30.659
Have I, is he dead, is he dead?

57:32.961 --> 57:34.795
Oh fuck!

57:34.828 --> 57:35.664
Enough!

57:37.332 --> 57:39.134
Well, I just knew
there was something wrong

57:39.167 --> 57:40.936
when he didn't show up last
night.

57:43.673 --> 57:47.143
Ma'am, what's your
relationship with Gervase?

57:48.244 --> 57:49.979
Oh, we're lovers of course.

57:51.813 --> 57:52.715
Of course.

57:53.883 --> 57:55.017
Now if you wanna get out of here

57:55.051 --> 57:57.387
you need to tell us everything.

57:57.421 --> 57:58.255
Everything?

58:00.324 --> 58:02.092
It all started when I
was in the eighth grade

58:02.125 --> 58:03.694
I failed my math maintenance
test,

58:03.727 --> 58:05.429
I took it home, didn't show my
mom,

58:05.462 --> 58:07.030
threw it down the sewer,

58:07.064 --> 58:09.199
then the bad habits just
started.

58:09.232 --> 58:10.500
Wait that was Gervase?

58:11.335 --> 58:12.302
In my bar.

58:13.204 --> 58:15.073
Man, I didn't even recognize
that dude.

58:15.106 --> 58:18.676
I started smoking cigarettes,
masturbating, watching porn,

58:18.710 --> 58:21.446
smoking cigarettes while
masturbating while watching porn,

58:21.479 --> 58:22.547
it was horrible.

58:22.580 --> 58:25.450
And that's when Tanner
knocked Gervase on his ass.

58:25.483 --> 58:28.921
Tanner did not knock me out, I
fell.

58:28.954 --> 58:30.823
Then I got expelled from high
school,

58:30.856 --> 58:33.025
I didn't know she was a nun,
she was in plain clothes.

58:33.058 --> 58:34.226
Enough!

58:34.259 --> 58:36.762
Everything about Gervase.

58:36.795 --> 58:41.800
Oh, Gervase, oh, well, I just
got done pumpin' some iron.

58:42.901 --> 58:46.906
I can't be handing out
tinctures, I'm not a doctor.

58:46.940 --> 58:50.543
This is not a doctor's
coat, this is lounge wear.

58:50.577 --> 58:51.711
After I knocked him out

58:51.745 --> 58:53.113
we took 'em to my buddy the
Doctor,

58:53.146 --> 58:54.381
we didn't know where else to go.

58:54.414 --> 58:55.648
This guys a really good friend
of mine,

58:55.682 --> 58:56.483
we took him in there,

58:56.516 --> 58:57.684
I thought he'd help him out,

58:57.717 --> 58:59.319
I went along with whatever he
said.

58:59.352 --> 59:00.821
He just wouldn't stop talking,

59:00.856 --> 59:02.056
he memorizes me when he talks.

59:02.089 --> 59:03.591
He's a really interesting fella.

59:03.624 --> 59:05.726
You gonna keep somebody warm
at night.

59:05.760 --> 59:06.961
I'm not a kidnapper.

59:06.994 --> 59:08.796
I never kidnapped anything
in my entire life.

59:08.829 --> 59:11.065
Kidnapping is a serious
situation, all right.

59:11.098 --> 59:13.300
This is something you really
can't mess around with.

59:13.334 --> 59:15.202
It's not uncommon for
people in your position

59:15.236 --> 59:17.806
to wanna defend their abductors,

59:17.839 --> 59:19.975
it's called Stockholm syndrome.

59:20.008 --> 59:20.842
What?

59:22.477 --> 59:23.278
Finish this off.

59:23.311 --> 59:24.146
I gotta take a piss.

59:36.392 --> 59:38.995
Oh my God, I can't believe
I'm a felon, I'm a felon.

59:39.028 --> 59:40.530
How can I be a felon I
was a Boy Scout once?

59:40.563 --> 59:42.665
Oh my God, please get me out of
here.

59:42.698 --> 59:44.033
Please, I'll do anything God.

59:44.066 --> 59:45.368
I'll get rid of my porn

59:45.401 --> 59:46.736
except for the one "Hustler"

59:46.769 --> 59:48.304
'cause I really like that one.

59:48.337 --> 59:50.040
Oh, please, please get us out of
this.

59:50.073 --> 59:50.875
Please, please.

59:50.909 --> 59:51.842
- Tanner.
- Ray.

59:51.876 --> 59:53.477
God doesn't hear ya hear.

59:53.510 --> 59:54.913
Sorry.

59:56.915 --> 59:57.815
Why are we here?

01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:01.618
You fucked up flounder.

01:00:03.153 --> 01:00:05.223
I just wanted to help you,
pop.

01:00:05.256 --> 01:00:09.761
No, you help me, you
help me more than you know.

01:00:11.196 --> 01:00:13.965
You gave me grandkids.

01:00:13.998 --> 01:00:16.434
So much fucking fun.

01:00:17.937 --> 01:00:20.941
When I think of the fun your
mother would have with them

01:00:20.973 --> 01:00:22.675
ah, my heart melts.

01:00:25.644 --> 01:00:28.414
Look don't worry about
losing the business.

01:00:28.447 --> 01:00:29.281
Yeah.

01:00:29.315 --> 01:00:30.884
Life's about more than that,
okay.

01:00:30.917 --> 01:00:35.788
It's about what ya leave
behind, your legacy.

01:00:37.657 --> 01:00:40.862
I've always thought that
when ya die ya die twice,

01:00:40.895 --> 01:00:44.464
first time when ya, you know
actually die

01:00:44.498 --> 01:00:49.469
and the second time when the
last person mentions your name.

01:00:51.037 --> 01:00:53.641
Now with those kids they're
never

01:00:53.674 --> 01:00:55.944
gonna forget your mother's name.

01:00:55.978 --> 01:00:57.278
Yeah.

01:00:57.311 --> 01:01:00.314
And because of you nobody's

01:01:00.348 --> 01:01:03.184
gonna forget that Gervase's
name.

01:01:04.185 --> 01:01:05.286
What an asshole.

01:01:05.319 --> 01:01:06.721
Oh, come on, he's fine.

01:01:09.525 --> 01:01:11.293
You done good kiddo.

01:01:11.326 --> 01:01:12.127
Thanks, Dad.

01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:13.562
I'm proud of ya.

01:01:13.595 --> 01:01:14.429
I love ya.

01:01:17.699 --> 01:01:20.836
Oh no, no, no just blow
me with the slow clap.

01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:21.703
No.

01:01:23.105 --> 01:01:25.308
It would be my honor, sir.

01:01:25.341 --> 01:01:27.878
I guess that's the wrong
thing to say in jail.

01:01:27.912 --> 01:01:29.279
Right time wrong place.

01:01:30.146 --> 01:01:31.447
No, please stop.

01:01:31.481 --> 01:01:32.749
Got it, rain check.

01:01:38.956 --> 01:01:41.392
Well, we gotta let these
assholes go.

01:01:43.093 --> 01:01:45.396
You know this story is so
unbelievable

01:01:45.429 --> 01:01:46.932
that it's almost believable.

01:01:46.965 --> 01:01:49.533
Yeah, millennials, what ya
gonna do?

01:01:49.567 --> 01:01:52.703
Everybody's got a cellphone
and a camera on it.

01:01:52.736 --> 01:01:54.405
You know you can't even get
in a fight with somebody

01:01:54.438 --> 01:01:55.839
and throw them in your car.

01:01:55.874 --> 01:01:56.876
Now when I was a kid,

01:01:56.909 --> 01:01:59.311
when I was a kid ya got
in a fight that was it.

01:01:59.344 --> 01:02:01.580
You throw somebody in the back
of your trunk they disappear.

01:02:01.613 --> 01:02:02.915
They still haven't found my
Uncle Louie,

01:02:02.949 --> 01:02:05.317
God rest his soul, maybe, we
don't know.

01:02:08.453 --> 01:02:09.688
What ya gonna do?

01:02:10.655 --> 01:02:15.194
Oh, by the way Gervais's
agent's here, paid the bail.

01:02:16.162 --> 01:02:18.031
Don't take it so hard kid, all
right.

01:02:19.332 --> 01:02:20.166
Ya did good.

01:02:21.467 --> 01:02:22.835
It's Gervase.

01:02:22.869 --> 01:02:23.703
Whatever.

01:02:27.406 --> 01:02:29.509
Let's go get these assholes
out of here.

01:02:35.382 --> 01:02:38.151
Martins, romper boy!

01:02:40.287 --> 01:02:41.889
Love ya guys.

01:02:41.923 --> 01:02:42.823
Good luck.

01:02:45.193 --> 01:02:47.695
You must be Ray.

01:02:47.729 --> 01:02:48.998
Yeah.

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:51.066
I just wanted to thank you.

01:02:51.100 --> 01:02:52.200
For what?

01:02:52.233 --> 01:02:54.569
New revenue streams.

01:02:54.602 --> 01:02:55.570
Is this your lover?

01:02:56.404 --> 01:02:57.438
It's my father.

01:02:57.472 --> 01:03:00.441
Ooh, Mr. Ray, well hello.

01:03:01.377 --> 01:03:02.845
So I thought I should tell you

01:03:02.879 --> 01:03:04.279
that Gervase told the police,

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:08.051
"That it was all just a
big misunderstanding."

01:03:09.585 --> 01:03:11.687
So why don't you buy me a drink.

01:03:13.622 --> 01:03:14.456
Okay.

01:03:15.658 --> 01:03:16.458
Follow me.

01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:22.967
Oh my God, I'm free, I'm-

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.870
- Hey, you were in here for 58
minutes.

01:03:25.903 --> 01:03:28.271
- That's a long time.
- Get your ass out.

01:03:29.706 --> 01:03:30.540
Comin'.

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:33.477
Nah, nah, I'm good.

01:03:35.279 --> 01:03:36.081
You guys
are taking

01:03:36.114 --> 01:03:37.548
this no snitches way too far.

01:03:42.753 --> 01:03:44.056
We're a team now.

01:03:44.089 --> 01:03:45.623
I gotta represent in here.

01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:49.628
We're a team.

01:03:51.296 --> 01:03:52.664
Tanner, get emails!

01:03:59.538 --> 01:04:01.040
This is Cisco in the City

01:04:01.074 --> 01:04:04.342
and I'm sitting here with my
main man Gervase Peterson.

01:04:04.376 --> 01:04:06.279
Gervase, I mean this is
fantastic, man.

01:04:06.312 --> 01:04:07.780
I mean literally a year ago

01:04:07.814 --> 01:04:09.549
I mistakenly reported
that you were missing

01:04:09.582 --> 01:04:11.018
and the whole world thought
that you were missing.

01:04:11.051 --> 01:04:12.251
They thought you were kidnapped

01:04:12.285 --> 01:04:13.319
but now look at you.

01:04:13.352 --> 01:04:16.156
I mean shit is, ooh, can I
curse?

01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:17.991
One, ya get one.

01:04:18.025 --> 01:04:18.992
Shit is crazy.

01:04:19.026 --> 01:04:20.094
You get two.

01:04:21.528 --> 01:04:23.164
After the incident you know
everything

01:04:23.198 --> 01:04:24.331
just fell into place for me

01:04:24.364 --> 01:04:27.102
and God works in mysterious
ways.

01:04:27.135 --> 01:04:29.436
So you just finished a M.
Night film

01:04:29.470 --> 01:04:31.605
and he bought the rights
to your life story too.

01:04:31.638 --> 01:04:34.075
Yeah, that was crazy.

01:04:34.109 --> 01:04:35.977
You know we start filming early
next year.

01:04:36.010 --> 01:04:37.412
We're already in pre-production.

01:04:37.445 --> 01:04:38.881
Son of a bitch.

01:04:38.914 --> 01:04:40.615
- What?
- Think about it man.

01:04:40.648 --> 01:04:41.750
- Gervase.
- Ya fell of the face

01:04:41.783 --> 01:04:44.686
of the earth, ya get kidnapped,
your story goes viral

01:04:44.719 --> 01:04:46.956
and now your back on top of the
world.

01:04:46.989 --> 01:04:48.556
Can you believe that?

01:04:48.590 --> 01:04:51.326
No, at least somebody
made out on this deal.

01:04:51.359 --> 01:04:52.161
I would say so.

01:04:52.194 --> 01:04:55.331
And I have an awesome agent

01:04:55.364 --> 01:04:58.434
and I just hired a great
manager.

01:04:59.568 --> 01:05:00.402
Cecily, how are ya?

01:05:00.436 --> 01:05:01.670
- That's-
- My pleasure.

01:05:01.704 --> 01:05:02.772
That's Cisco.

01:05:02.805 --> 01:05:04.273
Right.

01:05:04.306 --> 01:05:05.341
Yeah, we got some great things

01:05:05.374 --> 01:05:06.809
in the works for old Gervase
here,

01:05:06.842 --> 01:05:08.211
a little "Dancing with the
Stars",

01:05:08.245 --> 01:05:09.579
a little "Survivor" reunion.

01:05:09.613 --> 01:05:10.781
- Nice.
- Right.

01:05:10.814 --> 01:05:12.382
And wanna tell the good news?

01:05:12.415 --> 01:05:13.617
Sure, we're engaged.

01:05:15.485 --> 01:05:16.386
Beautiful.

01:05:16.419 --> 01:05:18.189
Man, look at this lovely couple
here.

01:05:18.222 --> 01:05:19.790
You guys are sharp as a tack.

01:05:19.823 --> 01:05:21.625
You must be going somewhere
tonight.

01:05:22.793 --> 01:05:23.593
- No.
- No.

01:05:23.627 --> 01:05:24.462
No, just Tuesday.

01:05:25.663 --> 01:05:26.999
Son of a bitch.

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:30.802
What's up, bud?

01:05:30.835 --> 01:05:31.736
Hey man, package for Ray
Martin Jr.

01:05:31.769 --> 01:05:32.570
- That's me.
- That's you.

01:05:32.603 --> 01:05:34.472
- Yep.
- Hey man, thanks.

01:05:34.505 --> 01:05:35.640
Son of a bitch.

01:05:40.914 --> 01:05:42.215
Dear Ray, thank you

01:05:42.248 --> 01:05:44.316
for everything you did for me.

01:05:45.517 --> 01:05:47.020
I can't believe how much
someone's life

01:05:47.053 --> 01:05:49.388
can change within 24 hours

01:05:49.421 --> 01:05:50.722
and even more in a year.

01:05:53.226 --> 01:05:54.459
You came into my life at a time

01:05:54.493 --> 01:05:57.363
when I needed something to pick
me up.

01:05:58.232 --> 01:06:00.700
It turns out that something was
you.

01:06:02.735 --> 01:06:05.371
You didn't have to do
everything ya did for me

01:06:05.405 --> 01:06:07.507
but out the kindness of your
heart ya did.

01:06:10.443 --> 01:06:11.245
What the hell?

01:06:11.278 --> 01:06:12.479
I can't read it, what?

01:06:12.513 --> 01:06:13.347
What?

01:06:15.050 --> 01:06:18.086
I heard Hybrid
Planet was closing down

01:06:18.119 --> 01:06:23.124
so I wanna return the favor
here's a check for $500,000.

01:06:24.525 --> 01:06:25.593
That should be enough to get the
company-

01:06:25.626 --> 01:06:27.963
- No.
- To where it needs to be.

01:06:27.996 --> 01:06:29.531
Consider it an advance.

01:06:32.767 --> 01:06:35.905
Peachie, ya did it again,
girl.

01:07:28.559 --> 01:07:29.827
Ah, hey, what's up, man?

01:07:29.861 --> 01:07:32.264
You're Kabir.

01:07:33.133 --> 01:07:34.034
Do I look like a Kabir, man?

01:07:34.067 --> 01:07:35.701
I don't know, am I saying that
wrong or?

01:07:35.734 --> 01:07:37.270
You're saying, I don't even
know who you're looking for.

01:07:37.304 --> 01:07:38.138
We're not, I'm not a Uber,
buddy.

01:07:38.171 --> 01:07:40.739
No, it said, oh you're not my
Uber?

01:07:40.773 --> 01:07:41.607
Not an Uber.

01:07:44.144 --> 01:07:45.678
I mean it says it was the
right car.

01:07:45.711 --> 01:07:47.013
What's your license plate?

01:07:47.713 --> 01:07:49.616
- Oh fuck.
- Fuck this.
