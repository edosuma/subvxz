Uh, look, Max,
I saw something when we were-

29:44.581 --> 29:49.143
It-It was something being buried, and it felt
like it was something- something important.

29:50.421 --> 29:52.981
- It was here.
- I know this.

29:53.056 --> 29:55.787
- This is the old radio tower by Highway 42.
- Max. Highway 42.

29:55.859 --> 29:58.487
- Isn't that-
- Yeah.just a couple miles from the crash.

29:58.562 --> 30:02.328
Well, there's
something buried there.

30:02.399 --> 30:04.333
I should go to Michael.

30:04.401 --> 30:06.836
Is that what you
really wanna do?

No.

if we're gonna do this...

30:14.378 --> 30:17.177
we've gotta
do it tonight.

30:18.182 --> 30:21.482

- Come on. Let's go.

30:50.948 --> 30:53.349

So.

31:13.770 --> 31:15.704
So.

31:15.772 --> 31:17.900
So we have to decide...

31:17.975 --> 31:21.001
what our next step's
gonna be.

31:21.078 --> 31:24.844
- Right.
- I guess we could just start digging.

31:26.149 --> 31:28.675
Or, uh-

31:28.752 --> 31:31.619
Or, um, we could look
for the next clue.

31:31.688 --> 31:34.350
- Yeah. The clue idea seems more, uh-
- More efficient.

31:34.424 --> 31:36.415
Yeah.

31:38.061 --> 31:40.029

about you being all shut down...

to fake the flashes, that was...

but it's not really true.

about you being shut down all the time.

One had a Kermit patch on it,
and the shoelaces were blue...

and you had your dalmatian dog
with you there...

38:48.756 --> 38:51.054

about the stupid flashes.

Maybe they shouldn't
see each other for a little while.

to explain themselves?

can there possibly be?

- [ Chuckling] No. Did you?

everything we felt...

this thing?

You know,
you and me?

40:34.061 --> 40:37.326

could feel...

served their purpose.

- You know, like being used.
- Is that what you think?

Because you're not the only one

to other things you could be doing, like...

watching Kyle barf
after a beer blast.

- [ Chuckling] I can't believe you just said that.
- Why not?

- Because it really happened.
- You're kidding me.
