"Why I Love Wagstaff."
That's the theme?

00:24.183 --> 00:26.952
Wasn't it "I Love Wagstaff,
Here's Why" last year?

00:26.953 --> 00:28.453
Come on, it's cute.

00:28.488 --> 00:30.555
"Because Andy goes here."

00:30.556 --> 00:32.591
"Because Ollie goes here."

00:32.625 --> 00:34.493
Where are our kids' projects?
We've been around

00:34.494 --> 00:36.061
the whole cafeteria.
There's Mr. Frond.

00:36.062 --> 00:37.796
Let's ask him where
the kids' stuff is.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.698
Mr. Frond!

00:39.732 --> 00:40.832
Is he trying to hide?

00:40.833 --> 00:42.234
Hi, Miss La Bonz.
Sorry,

00:42.235 --> 00:44.503
uh, Mr. Frond is
right behind you hiding.

00:44.504 --> 00:46.238
Oh, happens every day.

00:46.239 --> 00:47.706
Frond, are you avoiding us?

00:47.740 --> 00:48.774
No!

00:48.808 --> 00:50.042
What? No.

00:50.043 --> 00:51.677
I'm in-voiding you.

00:51.711 --> 00:53.178
Why is your lip all sweaty?

00:53.212 --> 00:55.380
Uh, uh, what? No, just...

00:55.381 --> 00:57.582
Okay, stop it. Where are
our kids' projects?

00:57.583 --> 01:00.085
We can't find them.
Uh, they are, um...

01:00.086 --> 01:03.422
they're right there. You didn't point
at anything. When you say "right there,"

01:03.423 --> 01:05.424
you kind of have
to point at something.

01:05.425 --> 01:07.526
Oh, I-I meant...
they're right there-there.

01:07.560 --> 01:09.661
Frond, stop. Just tell
us where they are.

01:09.662 --> 01:11.196
Fine.

01:11.197 --> 01:12.564
Your children's essays

01:12.598 --> 01:14.366
were a little...
creative.

01:14.400 --> 01:15.967
But I thought they were
supposed to be creative.

01:16.002 --> 01:17.669
Too creative.

01:17.704 --> 01:18.770
Too creative!

01:18.771 --> 01:20.505
I like the sound of that, huh?

01:20.540 --> 01:22.207
Offensive.
They were offensive.

01:22.208 --> 01:23.608
The school superintendent is here,

01:23.609 --> 01:25.711
and I'm already
on thin ice with her

01:25.712 --> 01:28.447
because my "credentials"
aren't "valid"

01:28.448 --> 01:29.715
in this "state."

01:29.749 --> 01:31.750
Come on, Mr. Frond,
how bad can they be?

01:31.751 --> 01:33.719
They're kids' stories.
I mean, come on.

01:33.753 --> 01:35.087
This bad.

01:35.121 --> 01:36.855
Ooh! Let me see that.

01:36.856 --> 01:39.191
"The following story
is top secret."

01:39.192 --> 01:41.126
If you love Wagstaff like I do,

01:41.127 --> 01:42.894
then you need to know the truth.

01:42.895 --> 01:46.631
Once you know,
you can never un-know.

01:46.632 --> 01:49.201
It all started last week
while I was sitting in class.

01:49.202 --> 01:51.670
Not two miles away, the worst evil

01:51.704 --> 01:54.439
this world has ever seen
had just traveled here.

01:59.746 --> 02:01.079
Nude!

02:05.385 --> 02:06.785
Clothing match... negative.

02:06.819 --> 02:08.954
Whoa, cool yarn!

02:08.988 --> 02:11.390
Clothing match...
good enough.

02:31.477 --> 02:33.111
Remain calm.

02:33.146 --> 02:35.280
Remain calm.
No! No!

02:35.281 --> 02:37.616
Remain calm.
Remain calm.

02:37.650 --> 02:41.453
You sent me from the future
to help you in this time,

02:41.454 --> 02:44.756
to deactivate the student
known as Louise Belcher.

02:44.757 --> 02:45.757
What?!

02:45.758 --> 02:47.759
Ow! Bad hug, bad hug!

02:59.205 --> 03:01.139
Child called Louise Belcher...

03:01.140 --> 03:03.608
I'm on my break.

03:03.609 --> 03:06.344
Whoa. Are you a super strong
robot from the future?

03:06.345 --> 03:08.980
Wait, don't answer that.
That's rhetorical.

03:09.015 --> 03:11.283
I got to split.

03:29.368 --> 03:31.002
Louise!

03:31.003 --> 03:32.404
Calm down.
It's me, Darryl.

03:32.405 --> 03:34.973
Come with me if you want
to continue to be alive.

03:34.974 --> 03:36.541
Wait. Why do you look like that?

03:36.542 --> 03:38.877
Because... I'm from the future.

03:40.079 --> 03:42.314
Do they not have razors
in the future?

03:42.315 --> 03:44.216
Because that mustache is not okay.

03:44.250 --> 03:45.650
Really? You don't think
it looks cool?

03:45.685 --> 03:47.018
Uh, nope.

03:53.572 --> 03:55.573
Louise, listen, the Frond
that's chasing us

03:55.574 --> 03:58.276
is a robot from the future
built by the real Frond

03:58.277 --> 03:59.911
and sent back to destroy you.

03:59.912 --> 04:01.746
No doy.
I got that already.

04:01.747 --> 04:04.382
I sort of figured this would
happen at some point in my life.

04:04.416 --> 04:05.416
Quick! In here!

04:08.287 --> 04:10.588
I'm dodging for two.
Hey, Louise!

04:10.623 --> 04:12.690
Hey, weird future Darryl!

04:14.393 --> 04:16.661
So, what did I do to him
in the future, anyway?

04:16.661 --> 04:19.063
It all happened on the day
of your eighth grade graduation.

04:19.098 --> 04:21.733
♪ The bombs bursting in air... ♪

04:21.767 --> 04:24.014
Hmm?

04:25.004 --> 04:26.808
Aah!
Hmm?

04:29.975 --> 04:32.277
The brownie chair surprise!

04:32.278 --> 04:33.978
I actually did it!

04:33.979 --> 04:36.614
Yes. And from that day forward,
Frond was never the same.

04:36.615 --> 04:38.750
He quit his counseling job
and boarded himself up

04:38.751 --> 04:41.486
in his basement, working day
and night on both a time machine

04:41.487 --> 04:43.688
and a robot that he
could send back in time.

04:43.689 --> 04:45.657
Last week, he succeeded.
How did you find out?

04:45.658 --> 04:47.425
Because I'm also working
on a time machine,

04:47.426 --> 04:49.828
and we go on a lot
of the same message boards.

04:49.829 --> 04:53.164
So you used your time machine to
get here? No. I had to use his.

04:53.165 --> 04:54.999
Mine doesn't work
and it starts fires.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.969
So you came back through
time just to tell me this?

04:57.970 --> 05:01.606
Just to be a narrator? And you didn't
bring any special weapons or anything?

05:01.607 --> 05:04.509
Just a bucket load of exposition
and a stupid mustache?!

05:04.510 --> 05:06.277
Do you know what, Louise?
At this point,

05:06.278 --> 05:08.680
if I had any special weapons,
I'd use them on you!

05:08.681 --> 05:10.982
But you don't, right?
I mean, just to clarify, Darryl.

05:10.983 --> 05:13.284
Just to check that box.
There he is!

05:16.489 --> 05:19.491
Here comes the sweaty-
Belcher-belly special!

05:19.525 --> 05:21.626
Ha!

05:21.627 --> 05:22.961
Louise!
What? It was funny.

05:22.962 --> 05:24.032
We got to run!

05:28.734 --> 05:30.668
Grab the rope!

05:30.703 --> 05:31.870
Ah...

05:31.904 --> 05:33.872
Run, Gene!

05:36.542 --> 05:38.009
Hey, guys, I know we're running

05:38.010 --> 05:39.577
from Mr. Frond for some reason,

05:39.578 --> 05:41.946
and though I'm totally
willing to go along with it,

05:41.981 --> 05:43.815
a little lunch would
really hit the spot.

05:43.849 --> 05:46.217
Small bits of pork throughout
the day is what they say.

05:46.218 --> 05:47.519
Actually...

05:47.520 --> 05:49.420
Maybe someone will drop some food.

05:49.421 --> 05:51.556
Come on, creamed corn!

05:51.557 --> 05:53.057
Hey, guys,

05:53.058 --> 05:54.926
- can I sit with you?
- Oh, fine.

05:54.927 --> 05:56.895
So, how's your day? Not great.

05:56.896 --> 05:58.263
Yeah, me, too.

05:58.264 --> 06:00.098
Why? Wh-What's happening?

06:00.099 --> 06:01.533
Yeah, no, I'll be fine.

06:01.534 --> 06:04.068
I-I, like... brought
the wrong book to school.

06:05.271 --> 06:06.838
Whoa! Mr. Frond!

06:06.872 --> 06:08.573
You've been working
on your fitness, girl!

06:14.547 --> 06:16.080
We need more creamed corn!

06:16.115 --> 06:18.183
I know! That's what
I've been saying!

06:18.217 --> 06:20.351
Run to the kitchen!

06:20.386 --> 06:23.188
I'll deactivate all of you.

06:23.189 --> 06:25.156
Mr. Frond, your skin burned off.

06:25.191 --> 06:27.892
We made you a get-well card.
It's a banana peel.

06:42.641 --> 06:46.110
- This kitchen is so shiny!
- Gene! Over here!

06:54.253 --> 06:56.221
Hey, Frond!

06:56.255 --> 06:57.555
Let's do lunch.

07:13.906 --> 07:16.307
Ah, finally, something
fun happened at school.

07:16.308 --> 07:18.910
Kids, one; Future Frond, zero.

07:18.911 --> 07:20.478
Hmm?

07:25.084 --> 07:27.752
Uh... aw, crap.

07:27.753 --> 07:30.922
So, now we're here,
living off the grid in Mexico,

07:30.923 --> 07:33.358
or... someplace, planning,
waiting for when they find us.

07:33.359 --> 07:35.627
I'm gonna take a nap
under a warm tortilla

07:35.628 --> 07:38.163
and then eat my way
out when I wake up.

07:38.164 --> 07:40.698
I've heard of a power nap,
but a flour nap?

07:40.699 --> 07:42.534
'Cause tortillas are made of flour.

07:42.535 --> 07:43.868
He's under a tortilla.

07:43.869 --> 07:45.670
If you're reading this... What?

07:45.671 --> 07:48.206
Oh, no, I'm not talking to you.
I'm writing in my journal.

07:48.207 --> 07:49.641
Oh. 'Cause I...
I can hear you.

07:49.675 --> 07:51.109
Yeah, I say it out loud,

07:51.110 --> 07:53.144
and then if it sounds good,
I write it down.

07:53.179 --> 07:56.314
Well, I'm kind of trying to
sleep under a tortilla, so...

07:56.315 --> 07:59.517
You know what? I am sick of
being on this beach with you!

07:59.518 --> 08:01.953
Okay, then go a little
bit down the beach!

08:01.954 --> 08:04.122
And by the way, we're in Belize.

08:04.156 --> 08:06.191
It says it right on my hat!

08:06.192 --> 08:07.926
"Un-Belize-able"!

08:07.960 --> 08:10.161
We got them at a garage sale!

08:10.162 --> 08:12.697
Yes! But it was just a mile away!

08:12.731 --> 08:16.000
"If you're reading this,
then there is still a chance

08:16.035 --> 08:17.902
"for mankind,
and more importantly a chance

08:17.903 --> 08:20.405
"for a really great moment
when everyone will think

08:20.406 --> 08:23.875
Mr. Frond pooped his pants."

08:23.909 --> 08:26.711
Well, I loved it. Yeah, it was
good. I mean, it was a little...

08:26.712 --> 08:29.180
some of the references I felt
were a little... But whatever.

08:29.215 --> 08:32.250
Okay, okay, I can see that I'm
not getting through to you two.

08:32.251 --> 08:34.751
But take a look at this.

08:34.753 --> 08:36.988
Okay, Bobby, you read this one.
This time, I just want

08:36.989 --> 08:38.857
to listen and get
carried away with the story.

08:38.857 --> 08:41.159
Just want to close my eyes
and listen to the story.

08:41.159 --> 08:43.528
Okay, fine.
Okay. Read it out loud.

08:43.529 --> 08:45.330
"Fart School for the Gifted."

08:45.331 --> 08:47.699
"It was lunchtime at
Fart School for the Gifted..."

08:47.700 --> 08:49.634
I love it already!

08:49.668 --> 08:51.302
...the coolest school in the world,

08:51.337 --> 08:52.971
And we were all jamming

08:53.005 --> 08:54.973
to my new song, "Gas Class."

08:55.007 --> 08:57.375
♪ Gas class! ♪

08:57.376 --> 08:59.377
♪ You wanna pass gas class? ♪

08:59.378 --> 09:01.346
♪ You gotta pass gas... ♪

09:03.015 --> 09:05.216
But then uncool counselor Mr. Frond

09:05.217 --> 09:07.352
decided to be a total ding-dong.

09:07.353 --> 09:08.953
All right, that's it.

09:08.954 --> 09:11.856
I know this is
Fart School for the Gifted,

09:11.891 --> 09:15.560
but this is not a place
for dancing or singing!

09:16.562 --> 09:18.363
Whoa, nice song, Moz-fart!

09:19.798 --> 09:20.899
That wasn't me.

09:21.867 --> 09:22.967
I-I didn't fart.

09:22.968 --> 09:24.402
If you liked that fart sound,

09:24.403 --> 09:25.837
wait till you hear this one!

09:25.871 --> 09:27.539
I've been working on it all year.

09:27.540 --> 09:30.408
It'll literally blow the roof
off of the school!

09:31.777 --> 09:33.411
Aah!
Give it!

09:33.412 --> 09:34.445
Give!

09:36.115 --> 09:39.083
Until you prove that
you can behave better,

09:39.084 --> 09:41.819
I'm confiscating your keyboard.

09:41.820 --> 09:43.021
Where are you taking him?!

09:43.055 --> 09:44.789
To my office!

09:44.790 --> 09:46.724
I mean, to somewhere
you've never heard of.

09:46.725 --> 09:47.962
Not my office.

09:47.993 --> 09:50.261
No! I'll just
follow him and find out.

09:51.986 --> 09:53.286
Aw! Can't believe it!

09:53.321 --> 09:54.788
Mr. Frond is probably
tickling the ivories.

09:54.789 --> 09:56.156
And they're probably laughing,

09:56.157 --> 09:57.472
because they don't know any better.

09:57.492 --> 09:59.259
Well, there's nothing we can do.

09:59.260 --> 10:00.827
Sounds like you aren't
getting that keyboard back

10:00.828 --> 10:02.829
until you learn to behave better.
Or plan "B":

10:02.830 --> 10:04.631
We get it back by behaving worse.

10:04.632 --> 10:06.433
Keep talking.

10:06.434 --> 10:10.103
Uh-oh, I'm listening to
music on a portable tape player,

10:10.104 --> 10:13.139
and it's making me
very curious about sex.

10:14.842 --> 10:16.076
No, no, no, no.

10:16.077 --> 10:17.911
No curiosity in the halls.

10:21.015 --> 10:23.083
I'll need my lock-picking kit.

10:23.084 --> 10:24.851
No, you won't.
I've got mine right...

10:24.852 --> 10:26.153
♪ Here... ♪

10:27.421 --> 10:29.337
Hmm?

10:29.357 --> 10:31.124
We've got to get
to the P.A. system.

10:31.125 --> 10:32.592
But they already did the
morning announcements.

10:32.593 --> 10:34.027
Remember? Jody had a birthday,

10:34.028 --> 10:35.695
and the canned food
drive is going great.

10:35.696 --> 10:36.830
That is all.

10:36.831 --> 10:37.964
That is not all.

10:37.965 --> 10:40.634
I have a special announcement.

10:42.703 --> 10:44.404
Aah.
Aah!

10:47.642 --> 10:50.210
And turn.

10:51.445 --> 10:54.481
Hey, uh, there's a
Brendan Fraser DVD

10:54.482 --> 10:56.149

Oh, it's so beautiful.

12:36.784 --> 12:40.220
His farts set them free.
He's a hero. Don't you get it?

12:40.254 --> 12:43.456
A hero? He wants to destroy
the school with farts.

12:43.491 --> 12:45.392
Oh, come on. It was
pretty ambiguous, Frond.

12:45.393 --> 12:48.094
I think he wanted the
reader to decide...

12:48.095 --> 12:50.597
if the fart destroyed the school.

12:50.598 --> 12:52.265
Well, it was...
it was still gross.

12:52.266 --> 12:53.800
Oh, it was beautiful.

12:53.834 --> 12:56.303
And speaking of gross.

12:56.337 --> 13:00.440
Heh. "Tina Belcher's
Erotic Friend Fiction presents:

13:00.441 --> 13:03.843
A Tale of Horror."

13:03.844 --> 13:06.646
I'm Tina Belcher.
I love Wagstaff.

13:06.647 --> 13:09.115
I love it so much that I
became the volunteer sheriff.

13:09.116 --> 13:10.665
Okay, I mean hall monitor,

13:10.685 --> 13:12.586
But that's like
the sheriff of the hall.

13:12.587 --> 13:14.454
Something felt off that morning.

13:14.488 --> 13:16.089
I could feel it in my bones.

13:16.090 --> 13:18.458
My arm bones, my leg bones.

13:18.459 --> 13:19.759
All the bones.

13:19.760 --> 13:20.994
Aah.

13:20.995 --> 13:23.063
Hey, Tina, let me in.
I'm late.

13:23.097 --> 13:25.365
Tammy, you're tardy. I have
to write you a citation

13:25.366 --> 13:26.800
if you don't have a note.
Ugh.

13:26.801 --> 13:28.335
Don't be such a tattle-tampon.

13:28.336 --> 13:29.436
I don't want to get detention.

13:29.437 --> 13:30.804
Sorry, Tammy, but I...

13:30.805 --> 13:32.305
Hello.

13:32.340 --> 13:34.341
Excuse me, boys, but do
you have hall passes?

13:34.342 --> 13:36.009
Or tall passes?

13:36.043 --> 13:38.411
Okay, thanks, Tina, you're
a sucker. See you later.

13:38.446 --> 13:39.479
No, Tammy, come back, I...

13:39.480 --> 13:40.480
No!
...got, uh...

13:40.481 --> 13:41.548
Wow, she's not cool.

13:41.549 --> 13:43.216
We have hall passes.

13:43.217 --> 13:45.185
We're on our way to get
our jock itch vaccination.

13:45.186 --> 13:46.887
Glad to hear it.

13:46.888 --> 13:48.786
Jock health is the most
important kind of health.

13:48.789 --> 13:50.156
Good luck.
Great.

13:50.157 --> 13:52.025
I hope to see you
at the pep rally today.

13:52.026 --> 13:54.027
Not if I hope to see you
at the pep rally first.

13:55.062 --> 13:56.296
Swish.

13:56.297 --> 13:57.964
Nothing but butt.

13:57.965 --> 14:00.166
Oh.

14:01.535 --> 14:03.003
Whoa. That boy's jock

14:03.004 --> 14:04.271
must have really itched.

14:04.305 --> 14:06.239
Aw. Well, I should get going.

14:06.240 --> 14:07.874
That rally isn't gonna pep itself.

14:10.211 --> 14:11.745
Come on in.
Watch your step.

14:11.746 --> 14:12.979
Y'all ready for this?

14:14.048 --> 14:15.682
Uh, ooh, mmm, basketball!

14:15.683 --> 14:17.617
Basketball...!

14:17.652 --> 14:21.721
And now, here come your
district quarterfinal champions,

14:21.722 --> 14:23.990
the Wagstaff Whalers.

14:25.026 --> 14:26.393
Yay.

14:29.497 --> 14:30.697
Oh, that's weird.

14:34.769 --> 14:37.203
Oh, stop eating my shoulder.

14:37.204 --> 14:39.906
Now I can't wear halter tops,
you stupid zombie.

14:39.941 --> 14:41.908
Oh, no, zombies are
attacking the school.

14:41.909 --> 14:44.578
And I already bought Tammy
a halter top for her birthday.

14:46.101 --> 14:48.917
Oh, no, the jock itch vaccine
must've turned the players

14:48.918 --> 14:50.585
into zombies.
We spent so much time asking

14:50.586 --> 14:52.320
if we could cure jock itch,

14:52.321 --> 14:55.390
we never asked if we
should cure jock itch.

14:55.424 --> 14:58.960
Aah.

14:58.995 --> 15:00.729
Aah!

15:00.730 --> 15:02.063
Guys, this way.

15:12.642 --> 15:14.609
We'll be safest
in the teacher's lounge.

15:14.644 --> 15:16.511
It's the only door
on school property that locks.

15:16.512 --> 15:18.346
Plus you can smoke
in there, in case

15:18.347 --> 15:20.282
anyone is feeling
stressed out. No judgment.

15:20.283 --> 15:21.616
Oh, no, it's locked. What?

15:21.651 --> 15:23.618
Is somebody in there?
No.

15:23.653 --> 15:25.320
Mr. Frond, you have to let us in.

15:25.321 --> 15:27.422
The zombie JV basketball team
is right behind us.

15:27.423 --> 15:30.358
You know, I... I'd love to,
but, uh... my...

15:30.359 --> 15:32.127
This...  ...won't budge.

15:32.161 --> 15:34.429
Mr. Frond, open the door.

15:34.463 --> 15:35.930
No. You can't leave us all out here

15:35.931 --> 15:37.599
to get infected.
We're just kids.

15:37.633 --> 15:39.334
Ow!

15:39.335 --> 15:41.236
The door hurt my knuckles.

15:41.270 --> 15:43.305
All right, look, let me explain.

15:43.306 --> 15:46.107
I have to keep myself safe so
I can guide those who survive.

15:46.108 --> 15:47.842
They're gonna need me.

15:47.877 --> 15:50.378
- Makes sense.
- Mr. Frond, there's a...

15:50.379 --> 15:52.614
You just stay in there.
Keep yourself safe.

15:52.615 --> 15:55.383
You're so important.
We'll be fine.

15:55.384 --> 15:58.787
- Yes, I think that's b...
- aah!

15:58.821 --> 16:01.356
I wonder if she can
taste his sadness.

16:01.357 --> 16:02.624
Oh, no.

16:02.658 --> 16:04.392
Uh-oh.
We've got trouble.

16:04.393 --> 16:06.628
Oh, no. We're cornered.

16:06.662 --> 16:08.129
Throw Gene at them.

16:08.130 --> 16:10.498
I'll soil myself
to become less appetizing.

16:12.668 --> 16:14.502
Damn you, low-fiber diet.

16:14.537 --> 16:15.904
Hey, let's spit on 'em.

16:15.905 --> 16:17.305
That's what my stepmom does to me

16:17.306 --> 16:18.807
when I walk in on her
in the bathroom.

16:18.841 --> 16:20.542
Great idea, Zeke.
Spitting.

16:20.543 --> 16:21.843
Spit on 'em.
Yeah.

16:23.713 --> 16:25.880
- Come on, do it.
- Big-time loogies.

16:25.915 --> 16:28.650
Oh. Gross, Zeke.

16:34.156 --> 16:36.591
Whoa, they're trippin'
on your flippin'.

16:36.592 --> 16:38.093
Keep going, girl.
Yeah, it's working.

16:38.094 --> 16:40.595
They think you're
flirting with them.

16:40.596 --> 16:42.263
Say something nice
about their eyes.

16:42.264 --> 16:43.865
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

16:43.899 --> 16:45.700
I'm losing them.

16:45.735 --> 16:46.901
Turn it up, T.

16:46.902 --> 16:49.004
Get your flirt on, girl, come on.

16:49.005 --> 16:51.238
Okay. Everyone,
stand back.

16:51.240 --> 16:53.608
Mmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm, hmm.

17:00.716 --> 17:02.017
Tina, no!

17:06.088 --> 17:07.521
I think we're safe now.

17:07.522 --> 17:09.223
I've got them
eating out of my hands,

17:09.224 --> 17:10.759
instead of actually eating them.

17:10.760 --> 17:12.027
Because they're zombies.

17:12.028 --> 17:14.462
Man, girls always go for jocks.

17:14.463 --> 17:16.064
Follow me, fellas.
Let's go somewhere

17:16.065 --> 17:17.965
where the 16 of us can be alone.

17:17.967 --> 17:20.101
If your butts fall off, pick
them up and put them back on.

17:20.136 --> 17:23.070
She was never really mine, was she?

17:23.071 --> 17:25.140
Who? Oh, Tina.

17:25.141 --> 17:27.541
It wasn't easy
dating 15 zombies at once.

17:27.576 --> 17:28.910
Oh, wait, yes, it was.

17:28.911 --> 17:30.412
Thank you, zombie boyfriends.

17:46.996 --> 17:48.997
"Soon, I couldn't tell
where I ended

17:48.998 --> 17:50.966
"and the zombies began.
Butts, butts.

17:50.967 --> 17:52.500
I love butts."

17:52.501 --> 17:54.002
Okay, I-I think that's
enough. I got it.

17:54.003 --> 17:55.737
It-it got weird.

17:55.738 --> 17:58.907
So I think you can see why
this one could not be displayed.

17:58.908 --> 18:00.575
I don't know. You're
kind of making a big deal

18:00.576 --> 18:02.344
out of nothing.
I mean, they're just

18:02.345 --> 18:04.245
a bunch of kids' stories, Frond.
Come on. But... but...

18:04.246 --> 18:06.648
But-but... but...
But... but...

18:06.649 --> 18:08.516
What?
Why... why don't they...

18:08.517 --> 18:09.985
Why don't they like me?

18:09.986 --> 18:11.486
I mean, I...
I'm the villain

18:11.487 --> 18:13.321
in all of these stories.

18:13.322 --> 18:16.424
Aw, don't cry, Mr. Frond, come on.
I'm not crying.

18:16.425 --> 18:18.426
You are crying.
Hey look, you weren't that bad

18:18.427 --> 18:19.995
in Tina's story.

18:19.996 --> 18:21.863
What? I was a coward!

18:21.864 --> 18:24.199
I locked myself in a room

18:24.200 --> 18:26.468
while children got eaten!

18:26.469 --> 18:27.469
What?

18:27.470 --> 18:28.770
Say it again.
I said...

18:28.771 --> 18:29.938
Okay, okay.
I locked...

18:29.939 --> 18:31.806
Say it, don't...
...myself...

18:31.807 --> 18:33.708
Okay.
...in a room...

18:33.709 --> 18:36.778
Mmm.
...while children were eaten!

18:38.114 --> 18:39.948
Look, Frond, uh, you're...

18:39.949 --> 18:41.883
You're not a villain;
You're... you're just...

18:41.884 --> 18:43.718
You know, you're c...
You're complicated.

18:43.719 --> 18:45.820
What? And you're really uptight.

18:45.821 --> 18:47.522
What?
But, I mean, it's not like you

18:47.523 --> 18:49.557
actually took Gene's keyboard away.

18:49.558 --> 18:51.459
Yes, I did.
I have it right here.

18:51.460 --> 18:54.362
Oh. Well,
so maybe relax a little. Right?

18:54.363 --> 18:56.831
Try to talk to the kids
about kid stuff.

18:56.832 --> 18:58.700
You know? Relate to 'em.
On their level.

18:58.701 --> 19:02.470
Okay. So, like, um, chicken
nuggets and, uh, e-mail.

19:02.471 --> 19:04.639
Uh... Well, you're... You know,

19:04.640 --> 19:07.075
you'll get to something eventually.

19:07.076 --> 19:10.378
Maybe I should try to spend
more time with them. Huh?

19:10.379 --> 19:12.147
Yeah, or... Yeah, or the opposite.

19:12.148 --> 19:14.349
Bob, Linda, thank you.

19:14.350 --> 19:16.718
I feel like we've had a major
breakthrough in here today.

19:16.719 --> 19:18.053
Let's hug.

19:18.054 --> 19:19.688
Ow, ow.
Let's seal this heal.

19:19.689 --> 19:20.922
Ow.
Okay.

19:20.923 --> 19:22.223
This feels good.

19:22.224 --> 19:24.592
So, are you gonna
put their projects up?

19:24.593 --> 19:25.660
Absolutely not.

19:25.661 --> 19:26.928
Linda.

19:26.929 --> 19:28.663
Wha... What? Oh.
Look, look, look.

19:28.664 --> 19:29.931
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

19:29.932 --> 19:31.433
She got him.

19:31.434 --> 19:32.767
Okay, okay.
She got him.

19:32.768 --> 19:35.036
Well, it's time for me
to get back out there

19:35.037 --> 19:37.172
and give the big keynote speech:

19:37.173 --> 19:39.574
"Behind the Student Body."

19:39.575 --> 19:41.109
This is where I really get to

19:41.110 --> 19:44.346
show that superintendent
my best side.

19:44.347 --> 19:47.282
You show him. Yeah, well,
tonight's gonna be your night.

19:47.283 --> 19:49.184
Thank you, Belchers.

19:49.185 --> 19:50.418
Oh, my God.
Get your purse.

19:50.419 --> 19:51.619
Got it.
And Gene's keyboard.

19:51.620 --> 19:52.887
Yup.
Let's go.

19:52.888 --> 19:54.389
Let's go.

19:54.390 --> 19:56.958
I'm ready for Pasta Prom!

19:56.959 --> 19:58.026
You look gorgeous.
Mmm.

19:59.061 --> 20:01.296
It happened. I felt it.

20:01.297 --> 20:03.064
The brownie chair surprise.

20:03.065 --> 20:05.433
What?
Oh, nothing, Tina.

20:05.434 --> 20:07.736
Nothing at all.

20:07.737 --> 20:08.970
What happened?

20:08.971 --> 20:10.438
Uh, just... I, um...

20:10.439 --> 20:11.973
Wait, what did you say?
Brownie chair supplies?

20:11.974 --> 20:13.575
No, Gene.

20:13.576 --> 20:14.809
Brown hair supplies.
Is chair supplies...

20:14.810 --> 20:17.045
No.
"Brownie chair surprise."

20:17.046 --> 20:18.313
Right. What is that?

20:18.314 --> 20:21.082
Okay, you put a brownie on a chair,

20:21.083 --> 20:22.584
Uh-huh.
and then you walk away.

20:22.585 --> 20:24.486
How is the brownie
at all surprised by this?

20:24.487 --> 20:25.887
No, the brownie's...
Yeah, what...

20:25.888 --> 20:27.422
Why... Why are you
pranking a brownie?

20:27.423 --> 20:29.791
Somebody takes a seat
without looking

20:29.792 --> 20:31.726
and they got brownie on their butt.

20:31.727 --> 20:34.462
Oh! God, it doesn't sound
as good when I say it out loud.

20:34.463 --> 20:37.165
So it looks like somebody
sat in a pile of poo

20:37.166 --> 20:39.067
that they put in
their chair on purpose. Yes!

20:39.068 --> 20:40.568
Right. There is more to... Yeah.

20:40.569 --> 20:43.104
That is a great but unusual prank.
Thank you.
