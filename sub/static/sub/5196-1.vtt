"Laura,"

00:48.342 --> 00:51.329
at this stage, I can offer
nothing more than my word.

00:51.678 --> 00:55.574
I'm a senior government employee
in the intelligence community

00:55.744 --> 00:58.851
I hope you understand that contacting
you is extremely high risk

00:59.071 --> 01:01.350
and you are willing to agree
to the following precautions

01:01.469 --> 01:02.917
before I share more.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.894
This will not be a waste of your time.

01:06.643 --> 01:08.192
The following sounds complex,

01:08.372 --> 01:11.638
but should only take minutes to
complete for someone technical.

01:12.028 --> 01:15.824
I would like to confirm out of email that
the keys we exchanged were not intercepted

01:16.234 --> 01:18.272
and replaced by your surveillants.

01:19.381 --> 01:22.647
Please confirm that no one
has ever had a copy of your private key

01:22.817 --> 01:24.795
and that it uses a strong passphrase.

01:24.935 --> 01:28.462
Assume your adversary is capable
of one trillion guesses per second.

01:29.700 --> 01:33.217
If the device you store the private key
and enter your passphrase on

01:33.417 --> 01:34.555
has been hacked,

01:34.735 --> 01:36.913
it is trivial to decrypt
our communications.

01:38.142 --> 01:40.470
Understand that the above steps
are not bullet proof,

01:40.629 --> 01:42.797
and are intended only to
give us breathing room.

01:43.017 --> 01:45.225
In the end if you publish
the source material,

01:45.475 --> 01:47.223
I will likely be immediately implicated.

01:47.413 --> 01:50.949
This must not deter you from releasing
the information I will provide.

01:52.418 --> 01:53.936
Thank you, and be careful.

01:55.594 --> 01:58.881
Citizen Four...

02:21.279 --> 02:24.266
Radio:... surveillance
means that there are facts

02:24.436 --> 02:26.014
under the law to apply to

02:26.224 --> 02:27.552
if we should take away the surveillance

02:27.782 --> 02:29.960
there are no facts the
government could manufacture.

02:30.380 --> 02:33.058
Oh, that's right and it's all about
creating an independent record.

02:33.506 --> 02:37.343
To me this goes to the question

02:38.042 --> 02:39.540
of independently verifying

02:39.880 --> 02:42.368
what the government is doing.

02:42.677 --> 02:44.476
That's why I keep going
back to that question.

02:45.205 --> 02:50.180
So, that was David Suruda.
After CBS News traffic and weather...

02:57.742 --> 02:59.201
Hey, can you hear me?

03:00.000 --> 03:01.998
I am here David, how are you?

03:06.423 --> 03:07.572
Well, I would just point...

03:07.722 --> 03:10.729
start by pointing to (what) Barack Obama
himself said about those questions

03:10.919 --> 03:13.636
when he was running for
the office that he now occupies.

03:13.816 --> 03:17.193
On December 2007 he said
"The president does not have"

03:17.502 --> 03:21.408
the power under the Constitution to
unilaterally authorize a military attack

03:21.708 --> 03:25.824
in a situation that does not involve stopping
an actual or imminent threat to the nation...

03:26.144 --> 03:30.419
So by Obama's own words, the president doesn't
have the power that he is now exercising

03:30.609 --> 03:32.118
under the Constitution.

03:32.378 --> 03:35.554
And as far of why it matters,
in... on August 1st 2007

03:35.804 --> 03:39.111
when he laid out his reasons
why he was running for office

03:39.341 --> 03:41.948
and why he thought it was so important
to change the way we were doing things

03:42.358 --> 03:42.997
he said.

03:43.207 --> 03:46.453
"No more ignoring the law
when it's inconvenient,"

03:46.653 --> 03:48.072
that is not who we are.

03:48.232 --> 03:52.038
We will again set an example for the world
that the law is not subject

03:52.188 --> 03:53.547
"to the whims of stubborn rulers."

03:53.766 --> 03:56.643
So to allow presidents to simply
start wars on their own without any...

04:37.003 --> 04:41.159
For now, know that every border you
cross, every purchase you make,

04:41.498 --> 04:44.375
every call you dial, every
cell phone tower you pass,

04:44.615 --> 04:46.783
friend you keep, article you write,

04:47.033 --> 04:49.440
site you visit, subject line you type,

04:49.920 --> 04:51.308
and packet you route,

04:51.688 --> 04:53.936
is in the hands of a system
whose reach is unlimited

04:54.136 --> 04:56.164
but whose safeguards are not.

04:57.492 --> 05:00.349
Your victimisation by the NSA system means
that you are well aware

05:00.539 --> 05:03.466
of the threat
that unrestricted secret police pose

05:03.656 --> 05:05.494
for democracies.

05:05.674 --> 05:07.972
This is a story few, but you, can tell.

06:02.417 --> 06:03.736
Thank you for inviting me here,

06:04.166 --> 06:08.222
to give me the opportunity
to express my story.

06:08.371 --> 06:10.050
But let me give you some of my background.

06:11.039 --> 06:14.565
I spent about 4 years in the military
and then I went to NSA directly, so...

06:15.424 --> 06:19.680
so I ended up with about 37
years of service combined.

06:20.030 --> 06:22.427
Most of it was a lot of fun!
I tell you, it was really a lot of fun,

06:22.607 --> 06:23.726
breaking these puzzles.

06:23.876 --> 06:25.754
You know, solving problems
and things like that.

06:25.784 --> 06:27.632
So, and that's really what I did.

06:27.922 --> 06:31.049
Fundamentally started working with data,
looking at data and datasystems

06:31.248 --> 06:32.297
and how you do that.

06:32.577 --> 06:37.402
I was developing this concept of analysis
where you could lay it out in such a way

06:37.792 --> 06:42.647
that it could be coded and executed electronically.
Meaning you could automate analysis.

06:42.957 --> 06:46.493
And it has to do with metadata
and using metadata relationships.

06:46.693 --> 06:49.330
So that was the whole,
that was my whole theme there at NSA

06:49.790 --> 06:53.266
that was eventually what I ended up to, I was
the only one there doing that, by the way.

06:54.176 --> 06:56.253
So any rate, you know, 9/11 happened.

06:57.962 --> 07:00.409
And it must have been right after.

07:00.559 --> 07:02.957
A few days, no more than a week after 9/11

07:03.476 --> 07:08.881
that they decided to begin actively
spying on everyone in this country.

07:09.260 --> 07:14.495
And they wanted that back part of
our program to run all the spying.

07:15.155 --> 07:18.181
So that's that's exactly what they did.

07:18.921 --> 07:20.760
And then they started
taking the telecom data,

07:20.899 --> 07:22.487
and expanded after that.

07:23.996 --> 07:25.854
So, I mean, the one I knew was AT&T,

07:26.074 --> 07:29.131
and that one provided
320 million records every day.

07:30.249 --> 07:33.067
That program was reauthorized
every 45 days by the,

07:33.696 --> 07:35.174
what I call the "Yes Committee"

07:35.374 --> 07:39.071
which way Hayden, and Tenet, and the DOJ,

07:40.040 --> 07:42.227
that program was called STELLARWIND.

07:42.447 --> 07:45.224
So first I went to the
House Intelligence Committee,

07:45.424 --> 07:47.292
and the staff member I
personally knew there

07:48.022 --> 07:51.358
and she then went to the Chairman
of that Committee, Nancy Pelosi,

07:51.598 --> 07:53.686
who was the Minority Rep.

07:54.285 --> 07:57.442
They were all briefed in to
the program at the time, by the way,

07:57.732 --> 07:59.571
and all the other programs
that were going on,

07:59.600 --> 08:02.217
including all those CIA programs.

08:02.497 --> 08:04.985
I wasn't alone in this,
there were four others out of NSA,

08:05.264 --> 08:08.431
we were all trying to work interally
in the government over these years

08:08.711 --> 08:12.357
trying to get them to come around,
to being constitutionally acceptable,

08:12.637 --> 08:15.914
and take it in to the courts
and have the courts' oversight of it too.

08:16.513 --> 08:20.759
So we naÃ¯vely kept thinking
that that could, that could happen,

08:21.748 --> 08:23.336
and it never did.

08:24.125 --> 08:27.102
But any rate after that
and all the stuff we were doing

08:27.802 --> 08:30.179
they decided to raid us
to keep us quiet,

08:30.559 --> 08:31.678
threaten us, you know.

08:31.968 --> 08:34.674
So we were raided simultaneously,
four of us.

08:34.885 --> 08:36.783
In my case they came in
with guns drawn,

08:36.982 --> 08:39.900
I don't know why they did that,
but they did. So...

08:59.420 --> 09:00.459
"Laura,"

09:01.188 --> 09:02.077
I will answer what I remember

09:02.307 --> 09:04.135
of your questions as best I can.

09:04.445 --> 09:06.723
Forgive the lack of
structure, I am not a writer,

09:06.953 --> 09:08.971
and I have to draft this in a great hurry.

09:11.178 --> 09:12.927
What you know as STELLARWIND has grown,

09:14.245 --> 09:15.224
SSO,

09:15.384 --> 09:19.230
the expanded Special Source Operations
that took over STELLARWIND's share

09:19.450 --> 09:20.469
of the pie

09:20.659 --> 09:22.197
has spread all over the world

09:22.397 --> 09:23.276
to practically include

09:23.586 --> 09:26.293
comprehensive coverage
of the United States.

09:26.543 --> 09:29.230
Disturbingly, the amount
of US communication

09:29.490 --> 09:32.427
ingested by NSA is still increasing.

09:32.937 --> 09:33.866
Publicly,

09:34.095 --> 09:35.655
we complain that things are going dark,

09:35.914 --> 09:38.881
but in fact our accesses are improving.

09:39.160 --> 09:40.989
The truth is that the NSA has never

09:41.168 --> 09:41.798
in its history

09:41.988 --> 09:45.174
collected more than it does now.

09:46.323 --> 09:49.340
I know the location of most
domestic interception points,

09:49.770 --> 09:52.837
and that the largest
telecommunication companies in the US

09:53.136 --> 09:54.985
are betraying the trust of their customers,

09:55.234 --> 09:56.583
which I can prove.

09:57.772 --> 10:01.128
We are building the greatest weapon
for oppression in the history of Man.

10:01.328 --> 10:05.294
Yet its directors
exempt themselves from accountability.

10:05.784 --> 10:09.130
NSA director Keith Alexander
lied to Congress,

10:09.380 --> 10:10.819
which I can prove.

10:11.838 --> 10:15.444
Billions of US communications
are being intercepted.

10:16.663 --> 10:18.301
In gathering evidence of wrongdoing

10:18.571 --> 10:21.088
I focused on the wronging
of the American people,

10:21.268 --> 10:23.666
but believe me when I say that
the surveillance we live under

10:23.876 --> 10:25.884
is the highest privilege
compared to how we treat

10:26.103 --> 10:27.532
the rest of the world,

10:27.932 --> 10:29.979
this I can also prove.

10:31.638 --> 10:34.665
On cyberoperations
the government's public position

10:34.964 --> 10:36.613
is that we still lack a policy framework.

10:36.813 --> 10:37.922
This too is a lie.

10:38.111 --> 10:39.740
There is a detailed policy framework,

10:40.059 --> 10:42.427
a kind of martial law for Cyber Operations

10:42.717 --> 10:44.295
created by the White House.

10:44.495 --> 10:46.653
It's called "Presidential
Policy Directive 20"

10:46.813 --> 10:49.520
and was finalized at the end of last year.

10:49.730 --> 10:51.918
This I can also prove.

10:52.627 --> 10:54.795
I appreciate your concern for my safety,

10:55.074 --> 10:57.162
but I already know how
this will end for me,

10:57.352 --> 10:58.821
and I accept the risk.

10:59.330 --> 11:01.088
If I have luck, and you are careful,

11:02.337 --> 11:03.806
you will have everything you need.

11:03.985 --> 11:05.194
I ask only that you ensure

11:05.384 --> 11:08.261
this information makes it home
to the American public.

11:10.249 --> 11:14.125
Does the NSA routinely intercept
American citizen's emails?

11:14.825 --> 11:15.609
No.

11:17.222 --> 11:23.346
Does the NSA intercept Americans'
cell phone conversations.

11:23.676 --> 11:24.505
No.

11:24.755 --> 11:25.953
Google searches?

11:26.143 --> 11:26.952
No.

11:27.142 --> 11:28.361
Text messages?

11:28.541 --> 11:29.210
No.

11:29.420 --> 11:31.298
Amazon.com orders?

11:31.658 --> 11:32.537
Nope.

11:32.757 --> 11:33.586
Bank records?

11:33.826 --> 11:34.385
No.

11:34.655 --> 11:37.752
What judicial consent is required for NSA

11:37.941 --> 11:39.630
to intercept communications

11:40.629 --> 11:44.075
and information
involving American citizens?

11:44.405 --> 11:47.412
Within the United States
that would be the FBI lead.

11:47.712 --> 11:49.551
If it was a foreign actor
in the United states

11:49.730 --> 11:53.056
the FBI would still have the lead
and could work that with NSA

11:53.266 --> 11:55.844
or other intelligence
agencies as authorized.

11:56.323 --> 11:57.372
But to conduct that kind

11:58.281 --> 12:00.249
of collection within the United states

12:00.649 --> 12:02.427
it would have to go through a court order.

12:03.346 --> 12:04.994
And the court would have to authorize it.

12:05.244 --> 12:06.223
We are not authorized to do it,

12:06.433 --> 12:09.010
nor do we do it.

12:16.153 --> 12:17.941
All rise.

12:18.341 --> 12:19.701
The United States Court of Appeals

12:19.720 --> 12:21.658
for the Ninth Circuit is now in session.

12:23.156 --> 12:26.053
Please be seated.

12:34.585 --> 12:36.384
Good morning and welcome
to the Ninth Circuit.

12:37.202 --> 12:41.748
The first case for argument is
Jewell vs. National Security Agency.

12:42.337 --> 12:43.466
You may proceed.

12:46.683 --> 12:49.790
May it please the Court,
Kevin Bankston for Carolyn Jewell

12:50.109 --> 12:52.876
and her fellow plaintiff appellants
in Jewell vs. NSA.

12:53.116 --> 12:54.465
Your Honors,

12:54.655 --> 12:58.351
plaintiffs have specifically
alleged that their own communications

12:58.561 --> 13:01.588
and communications records have been
acquired by the government.

13:01.847 --> 13:05.584
But the District Court found that
we failed to allege facts

13:05.963 --> 13:08.920
that differentiated the injury
of our plaintiffs sufferred

13:09.130 --> 13:12.497
from the injury suffered
by every other AT&T user

13:12.856 --> 13:15.615
whose communications and records
have been acquired by the government.

13:15.714 --> 13:18.980
Basically concluding that so long as
every one is being surveilled,

13:19.470 --> 13:21.248
no one has standing to sue.

13:22.167 --> 13:24.395
However to deny standing to persons
who are injured simply because

13:24.585 --> 13:27.262
many others are also injured
would mean that the most injurious

13:27.672 --> 13:30.199
and widespread government actions
could be questioned by nobody.

13:31.238 --> 13:36.023
Do they have anything concrete
that in fact a specific communication

13:36.393 --> 13:39.310
of your client was intercepted?

13:39.510 --> 13:41.638
We have evidence that all
the communications passing

13:41.827 --> 13:45.294
between AT&T's network and other networks
in their Northern California facility

13:46.892 --> 13:49.750
have been intercepted,
so that would necessarily include

13:49.979 --> 13:53.566
the Internet communications of
our Northern California plaintiffs.

13:53.885 --> 13:55.234
Okay, thank you.

13:55.813 --> 13:57.392
Thank you, your honor.

14:04.145 --> 14:04.814
May it please the Court,

14:05.044 --> 14:06.883
I'm Thomas Byron from
the Department of Justice

14:07.062 --> 14:08.820
here on behalf of
the Government defendants.

14:09.440 --> 14:13.656
We think this litigation
need not be resolved in Federal Court.

14:14.035 --> 14:16.932
In light of the oversight
of the political branches

14:17.192 --> 14:18.990
both Legislative and Executive,

14:19.600 --> 14:24.315
which provides a better opportunity
for oversight and resolution

14:25.114 --> 14:27.901
of the concerns raised
concerning nationwide policies

14:28.411 --> 14:32.866
of alleged surveillance
in these complaints.

14:33.366 --> 14:36.443
Even if it's revealed
that one or more of the plaintiffs

14:36.742 --> 14:41.098
had email or telephone conversations
intercepted that had nothing to do

14:41.308 --> 14:42.796
with the national security?

14:43.076 --> 14:45.074
Your honor, I don't know
that anyone necessarily

14:45.414 --> 14:48.341
would have standing to raise
the particular claims that issue

14:48.531 --> 14:50.139
in these 2 cases.

14:50.479 --> 14:56.063
We think instead that the kinds of claims
that issue here against these defendants

14:56.313 --> 14:58.850
are those that are
better suited to resolution

14:59.839 --> 15:01.737
before the representative branches
of our government...

15:01.967 --> 15:08.131
What role... would the Judiciary have
if your.. approach is adopted...

15:08.391 --> 15:10.579
Judge Peterson, I think the...

15:10.948 --> 15:14.045
I mean, we just get out
of the way, is that it?

15:14.335 --> 15:16.473
Well, Judge Peterson, what I think
is that there is a narrow category,

15:16.882 --> 15:20.958
subset of cases in which
it may be appropriate

15:21.168 --> 15:24.714
to step aside
for that narrow category of cases.

15:24.904 --> 15:27.342
But mmm... the Judiciary plays a role...

15:27.512 --> 15:28.670
To be sure, Judge Peterson...

15:28.790 --> 15:29.989
in our system.

15:30.149 --> 15:33.086
Yes Your Honor and we don't
mean to diminish that.

15:33.326 --> 15:35.773
You're asking us to abdicate that role.

15:36.173 --> 15:37.492
No, Your Honor,

15:37.861 --> 15:41.368
but it is a question of this court's
discretion whether to reach that issue.

15:41.907 --> 15:45.484
We do think that there is simply
no way for the litigation to proceed

15:45.793 --> 15:49.999
without risk of divulging those very
questions of privileged information

15:50.519 --> 15:52.656
that would cause,
as Director of National Intelligence

15:52.826 --> 15:54.065
has explained,

15:54.595 --> 15:57.192
exceptionally great damage to
National Security's disclose.

16:01.827 --> 16:03.006
Thanks for having me.

16:03.975 --> 16:06.103
Hum, if anybody has any questions,
like I said just..

16:06.293 --> 16:08.920
Basically just raise your hand
and I'll try to call on you

16:09.120 --> 16:10.429
as soon as I possibly can.

16:11.078 --> 16:14.015
So, who here actually feels like
they are under surveillance,

16:14.555 --> 16:15.943
pretty regularly?

16:18.551 --> 16:19.590
Everyone inside of Occupy.

16:19.819 --> 16:21.379
How many people here have been arrested

16:21.518 --> 16:24.425
and at their Court date had
their phone taken into the back room?

16:25.044 --> 16:27.002
How many people here
had their retina scanned?

16:28.181 --> 16:29.300
Wow.

16:31.827 --> 16:33.745
So you guys are actually, in a sense,
the canaries in the coal mine,

16:33.955 --> 16:34.694
right,

16:34.924 --> 16:36.662
because the incentives
are all lined up against you.

16:36.912 --> 16:39.719
Anybody see how the subway link
your metro card to your debit card,

16:40.808 --> 16:42.557
right? And, like, auto refill.

16:42.906 --> 16:45.164
This is a concept which is key
to everything we'll talk about today.

16:45.364 --> 16:46.652
And it's called linkability.

16:46.872 --> 16:49.689
Take one piece of data
and link it to another piece of data.

16:50.089 --> 16:51.108
So for example,

16:51.328 --> 16:53.567
if you have your metro card
and you have your debit card,

16:53.715 --> 16:55.574
you have those things
and you can draw a line between them right?

16:56.143 --> 16:58.541
So that's, like, not a scary thing.

16:58.760 --> 17:02.057
Except your bank card is tied to everything
else that you do during the day.

17:02.247 --> 17:05.233
So now they know where you're going,
when you make purchases.

17:05.893 --> 17:09.230
So when they decide to target you, they
can actually recreate your exact steps.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.577
With a metro card and
with a credit card alone.

17:11.926 --> 17:13.685
Like literally where you
go and what you buy

17:14.095 --> 17:16.602
and potentially by linking
that data with other people

17:16.801 --> 17:18.810
on similar travel plans,

17:19.040 --> 17:21.279
they can figure out who you
talk to and who you met with.

17:21.637 --> 17:24.395
When you then take cellphone data,
which logs your location

17:24.983 --> 17:29.809
and you link up purchasing data,
metro card data and your debit card.

17:30.069 --> 17:32.307
You start to get what you
could call metadata,

17:32.487 --> 17:34.335
an aggregate over a person's life.

17:34.574 --> 17:37.342
And metadata, an aggregate, is content.

17:37.551 --> 17:39.240
It tells a story about you,

17:39.490 --> 17:42.407
which is made up of facts,
but is not necessarily true.

17:42.566 --> 17:44.604
So for example, just because
you were on the corner,

17:44.754 --> 17:48.131
and all these data points point to it,
it doesn't mean you committed the crime.

17:48.481 --> 17:50.039
So it's important to note

17:50.329 --> 17:52.277
that if someone has a perception
of you having done a thing,

17:52.457 --> 17:54.854
it will now follow you
for the rest of your life.

17:55.214 --> 17:57.761
So just keep in mind that
what happens to you guys for example

17:57.991 --> 18:01.737
with fingerprints, and retinal
scans, and photographs.

18:02.057 --> 18:04.025
That is what is going to happen
to people in the future

18:04.215 --> 18:06.163
when they resist policy changes
and when they try to protest

18:06.572 --> 18:09.829
in a totally constitutionally
protected way.

18:10.389 --> 18:11.662
This is for you, Director Clapper,
again on the surveillance front.

18:13.016 --> 18:15.623
And I hope we can do this
in just a yes or no answer,

18:15.843 --> 18:17.921
because I know Senator
Feinstein wants to move on.

18:18.391 --> 18:23.386
So, does the NSA collect
any type of data at all,

18:23.575 --> 18:26.592
on millions or hundreds
of millions of Americans?

18:27.771 --> 18:28.900
No sir.

18:29.599 --> 18:30.598
It does not?

18:32.127 --> 18:34.075
Not wittingly.

18:34.465 --> 18:37.402
There are cases where
they could inadvertently,

18:38.111 --> 18:41.477
perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.

18:57.202 --> 19:00.389
Email from April 2013.

19:07.202 --> 19:08.161
The encrypted archive

19:08.321 --> 19:10.928
should be available to
you within seven days.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.945
The key will follow when
everything else is done.

19:15.623 --> 19:17.032
The material provided,

19:17.322 --> 19:21.128
and investigative effort required
will be too much for any one person.

19:21.358 --> 19:24.674
I recommend at a very minimum
you involve Glen Greenwald.

19:24.874 --> 19:26.822
I believe you know him.

19:28.810 --> 19:30.049
The plaintext of the payload

19:30.229 --> 19:33.076
will include my true name details
for the record.

19:33.855 --> 19:35.124
Though it will be your decision

19:35.354 --> 19:38.351
as to whether or how
to declare my involvement.

19:39.210 --> 19:43.795
My personal desire is that you
paint the target directly on my back.

19:44.035 --> 19:49.330
No one, not even my most trusted confidant,
is aware of my intentions

19:49.869 --> 19:53.256
and it would not be fair for them
to fall under suspicion for my actions.

19:53.495 --> 19:55.423
You may be the only one
who can prevent that,

19:55.863 --> 19:58.231
and that is by immediately
nailing me to the cross

19:58.460 --> 20:01.447
rather than trying
to protect me as a source.

20:03.825 --> 20:07.461
On timing, regarding
meeting up in Hong Kong,

20:07.721 --> 20:10.638
the first rendezvous attempt
will be at 10 A.M. local time

20:10.848 --> 20:12.766
on Monday.

20:13.076 --> 20:15.324
We will meet in the hallway
outside of the restaurant

20:15.483 --> 20:17.072
in the Mira Hotel.

20:17.851 --> 20:19.250
I will be working on a Rubik's cube

20:19.429 --> 20:20.728
so that you can identify me.

20:22.007 --> 20:25.883
Approach me and ask if I know
the hours of the restaurant.

20:26.063 --> 20:28.460
I'll respond by stating that I'm not sure

20:28.760 --> 20:31.278
and suggest you try the lounge instead.

20:31.447 --> 20:35.463
I'll offer to show you where it
is, and at that point we're good.

20:35.843 --> 20:38.470
You simply need to follow naturally.

21:15.264 --> 21:16.672
As far as positioning I mean

21:16.842 --> 21:19.081
if you want us to sit in any
particular way or whatever.

21:19.140 --> 21:22.007
You know, I'm gonna go there
just like we get better light.

21:33.206 --> 21:34.944
There is, you know, so many different

21:35.254 --> 21:37.331
enormous stories

21:37.561 --> 21:39.769
just that are kind of standalone stories

21:41.088 --> 21:43.815
that, even like you know certain
things on my individual document

21:43.995 --> 21:46.013
that can just be their own story

21:46.213 --> 21:48.320
and I just want to start
turning those stories out.

21:48.480 --> 21:51.397
I basically woke up this morning and
I already started writing stories

21:52.037 --> 21:53.915
hum so I'm hoping to, you know,

21:54.145 --> 21:56.462
start publishing within
like a day or two days.

21:56.812 --> 21:57.521
OK

21:57.661 --> 21:59.180
It's as long as you're good with that.

21:59.230 --> 21:59.819
Yeah

22:00.378 --> 22:01.697
and so as far as I...

22:01.867 --> 22:03.146
the stuff we have to talk about,

22:03.236 --> 22:04.384
I mean I'm kind of like

22:04.734 --> 22:07.951
dichotomizing it between,

22:08.680 --> 22:10.268
you know, stuff that I'd like
to talk you about,

22:10.428 --> 22:12.267
in terms of like the documents
and the content.

22:12.326 --> 22:13.865
Laura has a bunch of questions
about that as well.

22:14.105 --> 22:16.702
So while we're working through
the documents getting your take-on,

22:16.822 --> 22:18.470
a lot of the stuff that, you know,

22:18.690 --> 22:22.117
help me understand it better, but then
also the sort of You story, right...

22:22.386 --> 22:24.005
<i>like the who you are</>?</i>

22:24.195 --> 22:24.694
Yeah

22:24.934 --> 22:26.932
what you've done, why you've
done what you've done.

22:26.962 --> 22:27.461
Yeah

22:27.931 --> 22:28.870
and I'd love to do that first.

22:29.030 --> 22:29.529
OK

22:30.039 --> 22:32.366
In part because, you are
the only one who can do that.

22:32.556 --> 22:33.056
Yeah

22:33.255 --> 22:35.583
so I'd like to just get it done
so let it's done,

22:35.753 --> 22:39.489
and also because, you know,
it might be that you wanna do that early.

22:39.729 --> 22:40.318
Yeah

22:40.918 --> 22:44.324
because, it might be necessary,
we might choose to have that done early.

22:44.664 --> 22:47.401
What are you... tell me your thoughts,
just where you are with that?

22:47.671 --> 22:49.759
So primary one on that,
I think I've expressed it

22:49.989 --> 22:51.108
a couple times online,

22:51.337 --> 22:56.053
is I feel the modern media
has a big focus on personalities.

22:56.252 --> 22:57.082
Totally.

22:57.341 --> 23:01.787
And I'm a little concerned (that)
the more we focus on that

23:01.967 --> 23:04.005
the more they're going
to use that as a distraction.

23:04.894 --> 23:09.170
I don't necessarily want that to happen, which
is why I've consistently said, you know,

23:09.399 --> 23:13.395
I'm not the story here,
hum haha, nervous uh?

23:14.105 --> 23:18.270
No it's a very very cheap pen, I
just, the slider is broke, go ahead.

23:19.239 --> 23:25.064
Hum, but hum, yeah, anything I can do
to help you guys get this out,

23:25.483 --> 23:26.402
I will do,

23:26.692 --> 23:33.225
I don't have any experience
with media, with how this works

23:33.625 --> 23:36.392
so I'm kind of learning as I go.

23:36.842 --> 23:40.368
Right, so, I just want to get a sense of
why did you decide to do what you've done.

23:40.738 --> 23:45.933
So for me it all comes down to
State Power against the people's ability

23:46.182 --> 23:48.750
to meaningfully oppose that power.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.557
And I'm sitting there everyday,

23:51.757 --> 23:57.451
getting payed to design methods
to amplify that State Power.

23:58.350 --> 24:01.767
And I'm realizing that if, you know,
the policy switches,

24:02.226 --> 24:05.753
that there are the only things that
restrains these states, were changed,

24:07.082 --> 24:09.629
there, you couldn't meaningfully
oppose these.

24:09.869 --> 24:14.964
I mean, you have to be the most incredibly
sophisticated ta* col* actor in existence.

24:15.393 --> 24:19.889
I'm not sure there's anybody,
no matter how gifted you are,

24:20.138 --> 24:24.434
who could oppose all of the
offices and all the bright people

24:24.854 --> 24:29.229
even all the mediocre people out there with all
of their tools and all of their capabilities.

24:30.568 --> 24:33.585
And as I saw the promise
of the Obama administration

24:35.114 --> 24:38.990
be betrayed and walk away from it.
In fact, actually advance

24:39.939 --> 24:43.955
the things that had been promised
to be sort of curtailed and rained in

24:44.394 --> 24:45.793
and dialed back.

24:45.983 --> 24:48.330
It actually gets worse,
particularly drone strikes.

24:48.660 --> 24:49.809
Which I also learned in NSA,

24:50.069 --> 24:53.016
we could watch drone videos
from our desktops,

24:56.652 --> 24:58.820
as I saw that, that really
hardened me to action.

24:59.109 --> 25:00.049
In real time?

25:00.238 --> 25:01.427
In real time, yeah,

25:01.687 --> 25:06.252
it'll stream a lower quality
of the video to your desktop,

25:06.732 --> 25:09.729
typically you'd be watching surveillance drones
as opposed to actually letting you know,

25:09.989 --> 25:12.756
murder drones really going out there
and bomb somebody.

25:13.695 --> 25:16.212
But you'll have a drone
that's just following somebody's house

25:16.402 --> 25:17.761
for hours and hours.

25:17.951 --> 25:19.829
And you won't know who
it is because, you know,

25:20.059 --> 25:23.245
you don't have the context for that
but it's just a page

25:23.405 --> 25:26.492
where it's lists
and lists of drone feeds

25:26.692 --> 25:29.439
and all these different countries
with all these different code names

25:29.659 --> 25:32.846
and you can just click
on which one you want to see.

25:34.134 --> 25:37.531
Right, so if your self interest
is to live in a world in which

25:37.741 --> 25:39.799
there's maximum privacy,

25:39.979 --> 25:42.526
doing something that could
put you into prison,

25:42.746 --> 25:46.622
in which your privacy is completely destroyed
is sort of the antithesis of that,

25:47.002 --> 25:50.868
how did you reach the point where
that was a worthwhile calculation for you?

25:51.827 --> 25:54.814
I remember what the Internet was like
before it was being watched.

25:55.153 --> 25:57.851
And there has never been anything
in the history of man like it.

25:58.270 --> 26:02.556
I mean you could have children
from one part of the world

26:03.205 --> 26:04.924
having an equal discussion,

26:05.493 --> 26:07.501
where you know they were sort of granted

26:08.590 --> 26:11.497
the same respect
for their ideas and conversation,

26:12.096 --> 26:14.874
with experts in the field
from another part of the world

26:15.253 --> 26:18.440
on any topic, anywhere,
anytime, all the time.

26:20.768 --> 26:22.256
And it was free and unrestrained.

26:22.446 --> 26:26.522
And we've seen the chilling of that,
the cooling of that and the changing

26:26.712 --> 26:30.958
of that model towards something
which people self police their own views.

26:31.197 --> 26:34.024
And they literally make
their own jokes on ending up on the list

26:34.384 --> 26:39.489
if they donate to a political cause
or if they say something in a discussion.

26:39.799 --> 26:43.675
And it has become an expectation
that we're being watched.

26:44.444 --> 26:47.211
Many people I've talked to have mentioned
that they're careful about what they type

26:47.541 --> 26:48.930
into search engines.

26:49.229 --> 26:50.948
Because they know that it's being recorded.

26:51.097 --> 26:54.993
And that limits the boundaries
of their intellectual exploration.

26:59.799 --> 27:04.594
And I'm more willing to risk

27:05.183 --> 27:06.232
imprisonment

27:06.442 --> 27:09.459
or any other negative outcome personally

27:09.819 --> 27:13.185
than I am willing to risk

27:13.615 --> 27:16.042
the curtailment of my intellectual freedom

27:16.832 --> 27:19.359
and that of those around me,

27:19.689 --> 27:23.325
whom I care for equally as I do for myself.

27:23.795 --> 27:26.522
And again that's not to say
that I'm self sacrificing

27:29.069 --> 27:30.758
because it gives me, I feel good,

27:31.287 --> 27:32.706
in my human experience

27:32.985 --> 27:35.063
to know that I can contribute
to the good of others.

27:51.797 --> 27:53.555
Could you elaborate on that?

27:54.314 --> 27:58.760
So, I don't know how much the programs
and the actual technical capacities

27:59.079 --> 28:02.366
everybody's talked to you about
but there is an infrastructure in place

28:02.596 --> 28:07.451
in the United States
and world wide that NSA has built

28:08.450 --> 28:13.125
in cooperation with
other governments as well,

28:14.064 --> 28:15.863
that intercepts

28:17.081 --> 28:18.220
basically every

28:18.490 --> 28:20.228
digital communication,

28:20.668 --> 28:22.546
every radio communication,

28:23.085 --> 28:24.794
every analog communication

28:25.153 --> 28:28.410
that it has sensors in place to detect.

28:28.750 --> 28:31.157
And with these capabilities,

28:31.597 --> 28:35.153
basically the vast majority

28:36.142 --> 28:36.911
of human

28:37.711 --> 28:39.839
and computer to computer communications,

28:40.168 --> 28:41.317
device-based communication,

28:41.667 --> 28:44.893
which that sort of then forms
the relationships between humans,

28:46.492 --> 28:49.119
are automatically ingested
without targeting.

28:50.188 --> 28:52.985
And that allows individuals
to retroactively

28:53.385 --> 28:57.361
search your communications
based on self certifications.

28:57.731 --> 29:01.287
So for example, if I wanted
to see the content

29:01.527 --> 29:03.535
of your email or,

29:04.064 --> 29:05.583
you know, your wife's phone calls

29:05.833 --> 29:07.461
or anything like that.

29:07.860 --> 29:11.757
All I have to do is use
what's called a selector.

29:12.006 --> 29:15.173
Any kind of thing

29:15.603 --> 29:17.461
in the communication's chain

29:18.350 --> 29:20.947
that might uniquely or almost uniquely

29:21.157 --> 29:21.916
identify you as an individual.

29:22.126 --> 29:24.084
And I'm talking about
things like email addresses,

29:24.384 --> 29:25.773
IP addresses, phone numbers,

29:25.992 --> 29:27.021
credit cards,

29:28.390 --> 29:29.848
even passwords

29:30.188 --> 29:32.636
that are unique to you,
that aren't used by anyone else.

29:33.824 --> 29:35.962
I can input those into the system

29:36.432 --> 29:38.450
and it will not only go
back through the database

29:39.049 --> 29:42.466
and go
"have I seen this anywhere in the past?",

29:43.884 --> 29:47.181
it will basically put an
additional level of scrutiny on it

29:47.791 --> 29:49.489
moving into the future that says

29:50.198 --> 29:52.436
"if this is detected now
or at anytime in the future,"

29:54.174 --> 29:57.201
I want this to go to me immediately"
and alert me in real time

29:57.391 --> 29:58.979
that you're communicating
with someone,

29:59.159 --> 29:59.898
things like that.

30:04.484 --> 30:06.582
So I don't know who you are
or anything about you.

30:08.250 --> 30:14.644
Ok. I work for Booz Allen Hamilton,
defense contractor.

30:15.822 --> 30:19.239
I am sort of on loan to NSA,
I don't talk to Booz Allen boss,

30:19.489 --> 30:21.717
I don't get tasking from Booz Allen,
it's all from NSA.

30:22.486 --> 30:23.645
So, I don't know your name.

30:23.954 --> 30:27.371
Oh, sorry, my name is Edward Snowden,

30:27.721 --> 30:29.099
I go by Ed.

30:30.298 --> 30:32.586
Edward Joseph Snowden is the full name.

30:32.845 --> 30:35.942
(spelling) S. N. O. W. D. E. N..

30:36.282 --> 30:37.431
And where are you from?

30:37.890 --> 30:41.167
I'm originally...
I was born in North Carolina,

30:41.547 --> 30:43.355
small town, Elizabeth City.

30:43.545 --> 30:44.514
There is a Coast Guard station there,

30:44.773 --> 30:46.052
I'm from a military family.

30:46.811 --> 30:50.977
But I spent most of my time
growing up around Fort Meade in Maryland.

30:53.784 --> 30:57.830
And your family,
what's the consequences for them?

30:59.738 --> 31:02.416
This is actually
what has made this hardest.

31:02.795 --> 31:08.290
My family doesn't know
what's happening, they're unaware.

31:11.537 --> 31:14.554
I don't think I'll be able
to keep the family ties

31:14.843 --> 31:18.739
that I've had for all my life

31:19.099 --> 31:22.396
because of the risk of
associating them with this.

31:23.754 --> 31:27.591
And I'll leave what to publish
and what not to publish to you guys,

31:28.220 --> 31:34.983
I trust you'll be responsible on this. But
basically, the closer I stay to my family,

31:36.961 --> 31:38.561
the more likely they are
to be leaned on.

31:38.580 --> 31:40.018
So you don't want me to report this?

31:40.028 --> 31:42.026
We dont have... I mean,
we definitely want to do

31:42.046 --> 31:45.623
whatever we can not to
include them or bring them into the mix.

31:46.102 --> 31:48.160
Oh I'm sorry that's fine, I won't...

31:48.829 --> 31:49.858
I'm sorry I'm going to interrupt you.

31:50.198 --> 31:53.035
Can we just stop for a second,
do the document and then go back to that?

31:53.744 --> 31:57.411
What do I need? Do I need
an email address that we're using or...

31:57.700 --> 32:02.945
Well you can send... Once you've encrypted it, you
can send it from whatever you think is appropriate.

32:03.425 --> 32:05.643
The main thing is
you've got to encapsulate all of this

32:06.092 --> 32:10.068
in a way that it can't be
decrypted and read

32:10.478 --> 32:15.023
once it's in transit across the
network or on either of the end points.

32:15.533 --> 32:18.251
Ok I mean just so you know
these documents are basically all going

32:18.380 --> 32:20.248
to be uploaded within like 48 hours.

32:20.638 --> 32:21.926
This is simply..

32:22.166 --> 32:24.354
You want to get in the process
of doing this for everything because

32:24.634 --> 32:27.621
it seems hard but it's not hard,
this is super easy.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.279
Ok so just walk me through it.

32:29.519 --> 32:33.794
Ok. Show me the actual folder structure
where these files are first.

32:38.150 --> 32:39.359
How many documents
did you say there were?

32:39.728 --> 32:40.987
Seven.

32:41.197 --> 32:41.866
Ok well, while you're working...

32:42.126 --> 32:43.794
Ok go ahead.

32:45.103 --> 32:46.252
How many documents are we talking about?

32:46.701 --> 32:47.391
Because in The Guardian,

32:47.650 --> 32:49.399
that Wikileaks, technical people

32:49.579 --> 32:51.167
set up a system

32:51.417 --> 32:53.754
so that they were available
for anybody to see

32:54.863 --> 32:57.710
and I just wonder if it's
possible to do the same thing.

32:58.939 --> 33:00.627
That would be the ideal end game.

33:02.715 --> 33:07.640
But because some of these documents
are legitimately classified

33:08.290 --> 33:11.606
in ways that could cause harm
to people and methods.

33:12.645 --> 33:15.802
I'm comfortable in my
technical ability to protect them.

33:16.082 --> 33:18.000
I mean you could literally
shoot me or torture me

33:18.400 --> 33:21.487
and I could not disclose
the password, if I wanted to.

33:23.195 --> 33:25.922
I have the sophistication to do that.

33:26.292 --> 33:29.179
There are some journalists
that I think could do that,

33:29.618 --> 33:31.527
but there are a number
of them that couldn't.

33:31.826 --> 33:33.704
But the question becomes,

33:33.944 --> 33:35.952
can an organization

33:36.262 --> 33:39.079
actually control that information

33:39.349 --> 33:40.647
in that manner

33:40.947 --> 33:43.724
without risking basically
an uncontrolled disclosure?

33:44.354 --> 33:45.972
But I do agree with that, honestly

33:46.601 --> 33:49.269
I don't want to be
the person making the decisions

33:49.608 --> 33:51.327
on what should be public
and what shouldn't.

33:51.646 --> 33:54.753
Which is why rather than
publishing these on my own,

33:55.383 --> 33:58.839
or putting them out openly,
I'm running them through journalists.

33:59.089 --> 34:01.576
So that my bias, and my things,

34:01.826 --> 34:04.354
because clearly
I have some strongly held views,

34:04.643 --> 34:06.611
are removed from that equation

34:07.171 --> 34:10.168
and the public interest is being
represented in the most responsible manner.

34:10.418 --> 34:11.246
Yeah.

34:12.136 --> 34:18.889
Actually given your sort of...
Geographic familiarity

34:19.248 --> 34:20.547
with the U.K and whatnot.

34:21.077 --> 34:28.989
I'd like to point out that
GCHQ has probably the most invasive...

34:29.279 --> 34:34.103
I know - network intercept
program anywhere in the world.

34:34.652 --> 34:38.569
It's called TEMPORA,
(spelling) T. E. M. P. O. R. A.

34:39.978 --> 34:42.656
And it's the world's first "full take",
they call it, and that means

34:42.925 --> 34:44.214
content in addition to metadata

34:44.384 --> 34:45.842
on everything.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.036
So this is what I'd like to do
just in term of scheduling

34:51.226 --> 34:54.793
if it's good with everybody else.
Are you feeling you're done?

34:55.023 --> 34:56.192
Yeah yeah I'm done.

34:57.381 --> 34:59.369
So, I'm anxious to go back,

34:59.648 --> 35:00.957
get those articles done

35:01.556 --> 35:03.105
and then there is a
bunch of documents

35:03.295 --> 35:06.072
that aren't about those first two or three
stories that I'd like to spend time with you...

35:06.292 --> 35:06.991
Sure yeah

35:07.191 --> 35:08.100
kinda going over.

35:08.849 --> 35:10.697
I'm not going anywhere.

35:10.927 --> 35:13.245
You're available?
You want to check your book first?

35:14.683 --> 35:16.032
Let me check my schedule.

35:16.272 --> 35:17.121
Is that good for you Laura?
You want to...

35:17.191 --> 35:19.349
- It's great.
- OK.

35:34.354 --> 35:36.282
Hello.

35:36.521 --> 35:37.810
Yes.

35:38.010 --> 35:43.624
My meal was great thank you very much.

35:43.964 --> 35:46.991
No I still have some left and I think
I'm gonna be eating it later

35:47.261 --> 35:50.977
so you can just leave me alone for now.

35:51.377 --> 35:54.483
Ok great thank you so
much, have a good one bye.

35:57.740 --> 35:59.978
Let's fix that real quick.

36:02.276 --> 36:03.914
So another fun thing I was telling
Laura about this:

36:04.304 --> 36:05.942
All these new VOIP phones

36:06.192 --> 36:07.551
they have little computers in them

36:07.710 --> 36:09.918
and you can hot mike these
over the network,

36:10.118 --> 36:12.226
all the time even when
the receiver's down so...

36:12.835 --> 36:13.874
as long as it's plugged in

36:14.134 --> 36:15.054
it can be listening on.

36:15.452 --> 36:18.030
And I haven't even considered
that earlier. But yeah...

36:18.220 --> 36:18.899
OK.

36:19.079 --> 36:20.837
There are so many ways...
This could be...

36:21.686 --> 36:23.175
Everything that's in here
is pretty much gonna be

36:23.494 --> 36:24.893
on the public record at some point.

36:25.083 --> 36:26.342
We should operate on that.

36:26.571 --> 36:28.230
Yeah. Yeah, I think...
I think we are...

36:28.829 --> 36:30.747
So, do you have your
air gapped machine with you?

36:30.817 --> 36:31.736
I do, I do.

36:31.926 --> 36:33.035
Let me pop that out.

36:36.631 --> 36:38.050
Do you have an
understanding or commitment on

36:38.340 --> 36:40.647
when you guys are gonna
to press for the first stories?

36:41.377 --> 36:43.544
It's very seven or eight
in the morning in London.

36:44.164 --> 36:45.193
Uh uh, OK.

36:47.211 --> 36:50.427
Oh, let's see here.

36:56.941 --> 36:58.809
Ok, hey look there's another one.

37:00.887 --> 37:06.232
Pro tip, let's not leave the same SD cards
in our laptops forever in the future.

37:11.317 --> 37:14.483
Did you know this was still
kicking around in your laptop?

37:15.043 --> 37:15.602
Yeah, I mean that was the... mmh...

37:15.822 --> 37:16.902
OK, just to make it sure.

37:17.890 --> 37:19.229
OK, yeah. This is it?

37:19.408 --> 37:19.908
Yeah.

37:20.028 --> 37:20.527
OK.

37:20.657 --> 37:21.218
Right there.

37:21.886 --> 37:24.443
Thanks. You will have a new one
who will look exactly identical

37:24.473 --> 37:26.791
but it's a different archive.
So you might want to take.

37:29.039 --> 37:32.345
Could you pass me my
magic mantle of power?

37:32.565 --> 37:34.004
Uh uh...

37:40.717 --> 37:43.464
Is that about possibility of overhead?

37:43.944 --> 37:49.878
Visual. Yes, Visual collection.

37:52.216 --> 37:53.624
I don't think at this point
there is anything in this regards

37:53.884 --> 37:55.622
that would shock us.

37:56.501 --> 37:58.749
We become pretty...
Ewen you once said before,

37:58.979 --> 38:01.247
he's like, he's like:
I'm never leaving my room,

38:01.426 --> 38:03.404
I'm never leaving anything
in my room again.

38:03.604 --> 38:04.453
And the single machine...
I was like

38:04.673 --> 38:09.189
you've been infected by the paranoia bug,
happens to all of us.

38:09.408 --> 38:12.166
He was like... I would never
leave a single of these device,

38:12.395 --> 38:14.343
and I would never leave my and again alone.

38:14.873 --> 38:16.391
My bag's getting heavier and heavier.

38:16.401 --> 38:17.191
Exactly.

38:22.575 --> 38:24.014
Alright, I'm gonna need you to enter

38:24.054 --> 38:28.299
your root password 'cause
I don't know what it is.

38:28.779 --> 38:31.546
If you wanna use this
you're more than welcome, so uh ..

38:31.886 --> 38:34.543
OK, looks like your root
password's not 4 caracters long anyway.

38:34.733 --> 38:37.850
It's usually a lot longer but that's
just like a one time only thing, right?

38:38.140 --> 38:39.748
So, it is uh...

38:39.988 --> 38:43.464
It had been a lot longer but ever since I
knew is that it was a one time only session,

38:43.614 --> 38:45.662
I've been making it shorter.
Is that not good?

38:46.042 --> 38:49.568
It's actually not. I was expressing this
with Laura either.

38:50.287 --> 38:52.206
The issue is because of the fact
it's got a hardware MAC address

38:52.465 --> 38:53.304
and things like that,

38:53.534 --> 38:57.990
and if people are able to identify
your machine and they're able to...

38:58.160 --> 39:00.168
This is the fact you're about
to break the most upsetting story?

39:00.417 --> 39:01.476
Yeah, that's true.

39:01.906 --> 39:03.185
So they might kinda prioritize.

39:03.474 --> 39:06.451
It's ten letters I type very quickly.
Actually it's ten letters but...

39:06.731 --> 39:11.516
So ten letters would be good if they
had to bruteforce the entire key space.

39:12.735 --> 39:15.912
That would still probably only take
a couple of days for NSA. Uh...

39:18.929 --> 39:23.304
That's a fire alarm, OK...

39:24.204 --> 39:28.639
hopefully this just sounds like
a 3 seconds test or is this...

39:28.859 --> 39:33.784
Do you wanna to call the desk and ask?
It's fine.

39:34.054 --> 39:36.732
Yeah, I don't think it's an issue,
but it's interesting that I just.

39:36.791 --> 39:37.890
Did that happen before?

39:38.090 --> 39:42.215
Maybe they got mad cause they couldn't
listen into us through the phone anymore.

39:43.065 --> 39:45.692
Has the fire alarm gone off before?

39:46.052 --> 39:54.044
No that's the first time that has happened. Let me...
so just in case they have like an alert.

39:58.100 --> 39:59.248
We probably...

39:59.448 --> 40:01.067
We might have to evacuate.

40:01.286 --> 40:03.694
Should we ignore that, I don't know?

40:03.984 --> 40:05.442
It's not continuous.

40:05.692 --> 40:09.948
It's not continuous.
No, I'm just saying if it continues...

40:13.904 --> 40:16.063
And then we come and
meet the guys down in the lobby.

40:16.571 --> 40:17.210
Yeah, alright.

40:17.460 --> 40:18.639
Yeah.

40:19.428 --> 40:25.312
Yeah let's, let's leave for now
when we'll have finished this up.

40:36.501 --> 40:39.079
Not that they're gonna answer 'cause
they probably have seven thousands calls.

40:39.288 --> 40:40.447
Yeah.

40:43.234 --> 40:45.942
Hi, we hear a loud buzzing
on the tenth flour.

40:46.211 --> 40:47.410
Can you tell us what that is?

40:49.848 --> 40:50.647
Ah, OK.

40:51.456 --> 40:52.245
OK, great.

40:52.425 --> 40:53.644
Thank you, bye.

40:55.172 --> 40:57.280
Fire alarm testing, maintenance.

40:57.530 --> 40:59.448
Yes. That's good,
that's what I wanted to hear.

41:01.386 --> 41:07.370
Nice of them to...
Nice of them to let us know.

41:09.059 --> 41:11.156
Uhm, I just wanna give you
kind of a quick tour, uh..

41:11.426 --> 41:13.784
When Laura was looking at this
she was kind of salivating...

41:13.934 --> 41:16.132
and couldn't stop like
actually reading these documents.

41:16.291 --> 41:18.209
Right, right.
So we'll try and restrain ourselves

41:18.219 --> 41:20.019
although I don't promise
that it will succeed.

41:20.088 --> 41:22.225
I just wanna kinda explain
a brief overview

41:22.925 --> 41:24.773
of what these are
and how they're organized.

41:25.103 --> 41:27.110
On the beginning of
document of interest,

41:27.420 --> 41:29.798
the primary purposes of the second archive
is to bring the focus over to.

41:30.048 --> 41:33.104
SSO as opposed to PRISM.

41:33.344 --> 41:36.671
This is in general.
SSO are the Special Source Operations.

41:37.230 --> 41:41.446
This is the world wide
passive collection on networks

41:41.906 --> 41:45.302
they're both domestic to the US
and international.

41:45.732 --> 41:47.840
There's a lot of
different ways they do it

41:48.089 --> 41:50.897
but, uh corporate partnerships
are one of the primary things,

41:51.096 --> 41:53.335
they do domestically
they also do this for multinationals

41:53.454 --> 41:55.812
that might be headquarted
in the US so they can kinda coerce

41:55.902 --> 41:57.920
or just pay into giving them access.

41:58.269 --> 42:01.396
And they also do bilaterally
with the assistance of certain governments.

42:02.016 --> 42:03.774
And that's based on the
premise that they go.

42:03.864 --> 42:07.160
"All right, we'll help you set the system
up if you give us all the data from it".

42:08.259 --> 42:12.755
Hum, there's... there's a lot more here

42:13.074 --> 42:15.172
than any one person
or probably one team could do.

42:15.362 --> 42:16.321
Right.

42:16.561 --> 42:18.449
Hum, XKEYSCORE Deep Dive.

42:18.859 --> 42:22.155
XKEYSCORE in general, and there's
a huge folder of documentation

42:22.355 --> 42:24.153
on XKEYSCORE and how it works,

42:24.963 --> 42:27.140
is the front-end system
that analysts use

42:29.568 --> 42:30.477
for querying that sort of ocean of raw
singing that I was telling you about.

42:30.877 --> 42:33.814
All that stuff where you can sort of
do the retroactive searches,

42:34.163 --> 42:35.962
live searches, get flagging, what not.

42:36.701 --> 42:39.078
XKEYSCORE is the front-end for that.

42:40.787 --> 42:44.613
I'm just gonna show you one slide here,
'cause Laura thought it was valuable

42:44.823 --> 42:49.218
on this talk on kinda
how these capabilities ramp up

42:49.428 --> 42:51.886
in sophistication over time.

42:52.355 --> 42:53.644
This is kinda nice.

42:53.964 --> 42:55.852
As of fiscal year 2011, they could monitor

42:56.241 --> 43:00.657
1 billion telephones and
internet sessions simultanously,

43:00.917 --> 43:02.485
per one of these devices,

43:02.955 --> 43:07.820
and they can collect at a rate
of 125 Gigabytes a second,

43:09.698 --> 43:10.897
which is a Terabit per second.

43:11.106 --> 43:11.816
That's for each one of these?

43:12.075 --> 43:13.554
That's for each one of these, yeah.

43:13.624 --> 43:16.041
How many TUMULT missions
would that be then?

43:16.241 --> 43:18.579
Part of this, back then
there were 20 sites,

43:18.949 --> 43:21.846
there's ten at DOD installations.

43:22.065 --> 43:24.813
But these are all outdated,
we've expanded pretty rapidly.

43:27.440 --> 43:29.548
But still 20 sites, that's
at least 20 billion.

43:29.808 --> 43:33.034
This all need to get out.
You know what I mean, it's like...

43:33.414 --> 43:39.088
Just in terms of understanding,
the capabilities, it's so opaque.

43:39.398 --> 43:41.836
It's not science fiction.
This stuff is happening right now.

43:41.896 --> 43:44.213
No, that's what I mean, it's like...
The magnitude of it,

43:44.843 --> 43:49.058
and like this a pretty inaccessible
technical document.

43:49.898 --> 43:52.755
But, even this it's really chilling,
you know what I mean?

43:53.164 --> 43:55.772
Yeah, I mean, we should be having debates

43:56.241 --> 43:57.969
about whether we want Government

43:58.319 --> 44:01.806
I mean this is massive and extraordinary.
It's amazing...

44:02.725 --> 44:04.884
Even though you know it...
Even though you know that...

44:04.933 --> 44:08.329
to see it like the
physical blueprints of it

44:08.689 --> 44:10.477
and sort of the technical
expressions of it,

44:11.396 --> 44:15.527
brutally hits home like...
in a super visceral way that is so needed.

44:21.386 --> 44:22.615
<font color="#FFFF00">This is CNN Breaking news.</font>

44:22.915 --> 44:26.451
<font color="#FFFF00">An explosive new report is
re-igniting the concerns</font>

44:26.741 --> 44:30.577
<font color="#FFFF00">that your privacy is being violated
to protect America's "security".</font>

44:30.996 --> 44:34.783
<font color="#FFFF00">It reveals a court order giving
the National Security Agency</font>

44:35.482 --> 44:38.189
<font color="#FFFF00">blanket access to millions of
Verizon customer's records</font>

44:38.469 --> 44:39.868
<font color="#FFFF00">on a daily basis.</font>

44:40.097 --> 44:42.125
<font color="#FFFF00">Earlier I had the chance to
conduct the first TV interview</font>

44:42.365 --> 44:44.663
<font color="#FFFF00">with the reporter
who broke this story wide open,</font>

44:45.102 --> 44:47.430
<font color="#FFFF00">Glenn Greenwald, of The Guardian.</font>

44:48.269 --> 44:49.428
<font color="#FFFF00">Congratulations on the scoop!</font>

44:49.718 --> 44:52.695
<font color="#FFFF00">Explain for our viewers
why this is important?</font>

44:54.313 --> 44:56.112
<font color="#FFFF00">It's important because
people have understood</font>

44:56.241 --> 44:58.779
<font color="#FFFF00">that the law that this was done under,
which is the Patriot Act</font>

44:59.008 --> 45:00.617
<font color="#FFFF00">enacted in the wake of 9/11.</font>

45:00.996 --> 45:04.473
<font color="#FFFF00">Was a law that allowed the government
very broad powers to get records</font>

45:04.703 --> 45:10.047
<font color="#FFFF00">about people with a lower level of suspicion
and probable cause to traditional standards.</font>

45:10.257 --> 45:12.496
<font color="#FFFF00">So it has always been assumed
that under the Patriot Act,</font>

45:12.585 --> 45:14.833
<font color="#FFFF00">if the government had even any suspicion
that you where involved</font>

45:14.982 --> 45:18.249
<font color="#FFFF00">in a crime or terrorism, they could
get a lot of information about you.</font>

45:18.579 --> 45:21.476
<font color="#FFFF00">What this court order does
that makes it so striking</font>

45:21.726 --> 45:26.391
<font color="#FFFF00">is that it's not directed at any individuals
who they believe or have suspicion of</font>

45:26.651 --> 45:28.918
<font color="#FFFF00">committing crime or a part of
a terrorist organization.</font>

45:29.238 --> 45:33.943
<font color="#FFFF00">It's collecting the phone records of
every single customer of Verizon business</font>

45:34.373 --> 45:37.531
<font color="#FFFF00">and finding out every single call that
they've made internationally and locally.

45:37.929 --> 45:41.346
<font color="#FFFF00">So it's indiscriminant and it's sweeping.
It's a Government program designed</font>

45:41.636 --> 45:43.354
<font color="#FFFF00">to collect information about all Americans</font>

45:43.684 --> 45:46.001
<font color="#FFFF00">not just people
where they believe there is reason to think</font>

45:46.131 --> 45:47.251
<font color="#FFFF00">they've done anything wrong.</font>

46:49.228 --> 46:50.417
It's a tough situation.

46:50.667 --> 46:51.875
You know hearing that

46:52.085 --> 46:54.942
the person that you love
that you've spent the decade with

46:55.422 --> 46:57.090
may not be coming back.

47:01.935 --> 47:03.154
What did they ask her?

47:04.832 --> 47:06.780
Hum... When was the last time she saw me?

47:06.950 --> 47:08.249
Where am I?

47:08.559 --> 47:10.027
What am I doing?

47:10.267 --> 47:11.106
Hum.. you know.

47:11.306 --> 47:13.164
What does she know about my illness?

47:13.614 --> 47:14.683
Things like that.

47:17.909 --> 47:22.934
So yeah they're pretty solidly aware.

47:23.304 --> 47:25.112
Cause she's...

47:25.422 --> 47:28.269
I'm clearly not at home ill.

47:49.068 --> 47:51.016
Hello, hello.

47:52.415 --> 47:55.422
Hello, let me disconnect
from the Internet.

47:59.817 --> 48:01.466
So there is some news?

48:02.025 --> 48:03.594
Yes there was indeed some news.

48:05.222 --> 48:08.109
I have config today, I think,
maybe just a few hours ago.

48:08.619 --> 48:11.835
What kind of people does it...?

48:13.933 --> 48:19.218
An HR lady I'm assuming from NSA
as opposed to Booz Allen.

48:19.697 --> 48:21.246
Because she has was accompanied
by a police officer

48:21.536 --> 48:24.593
which mean the NSA police
and they're planning to break into my house

48:24.982 --> 48:27.430
which regular police don't do.

48:27.650 --> 48:29.128
Does she lives there?

48:29.398 --> 48:32.485
Yeah she lives there so I
told her to cooperate fully

48:33.054 --> 48:34.573
I can't find my phone just one second.

48:34.822 --> 48:36.081
And don't worry about herself.

48:36.351 --> 48:38.479
You know what I gonna do,
I'll just take out the stuff I want to use.

48:38.728 --> 48:39.707
OK

48:40.447 --> 48:43.064
OK well look I mean this
is not a surprise at all.

48:43.314 --> 48:46.351
Not yeah I know I planned for it but
it's just you know when it's impacting

48:46.601 --> 48:48.668
and when they're talking to you
it's a little bit different.

48:48.938 --> 48:49.618
Absolutely.

48:51.626 --> 48:54.902
But it's possible that they just noticed
that you're missing

48:55.092 --> 48:56.412
I guess it's not really possible.

48:56.611 --> 49:01.516
It is but yeah they're I mean.

49:04.503 --> 49:06.591
Hum... let me just get rid of this.

49:08.589 --> 49:12.555
So I obviously was focused on other things
than appearance this morning.

49:14.752 --> 49:17.669
How was she? How does she reacted?
Was she relatively calm about it?

49:17.849 --> 49:19.048
She's relatively calm.

49:19.338 --> 49:21.177
Does she know anything
about what you're doing?

49:21.206 --> 49:23.244
She has, she has no idea

49:23.703 --> 49:27.280
and that's I mean I feel badly about that

49:27.510 --> 49:29.349
but that's the only way
I could think of where

49:29.647 --> 49:31.765
like she can't be in trouble.

49:31.965 --> 49:33.623
Did you just basically do a
"I have to go somewhere for reasons

49:33.893 --> 49:35.651
"that I can't tell you
about" kind of thing?

49:35.701 --> 49:37.859
I just disappeared
when she was on vacation

49:38.269 --> 49:40.487
and I left a note saying.

49:40.676 --> 49:42.734
"Hey I'm gonna be away
for a while for work"

49:42.954 --> 49:44.972
which isn't unusual for me in my business.

49:45.472 --> 49:46.031
Right

49:46.281 --> 49:46.850
you know so.

49:47.090 --> 49:49.328
OK so let me ask a couple
things just quickly.

49:49.548 --> 49:52.754
Are they gonna be able to go into your
stuff and figure out what you took?

49:55.641 --> 50:02.155
Hum in some kind of some sort of like
peripheral sense but not necessarily.

50:02.664 --> 50:06.301
Yes because I cast such a wide net

50:06.541 --> 50:08.588
I they do that the only thing they're gonna
do is they're gonna have a heart attack

50:08.808 --> 50:10.646
because they're gonna go
"He had access to everything".

50:10.906 --> 50:11.406
Yeah

50:11.625 --> 50:14.812
and they not gonna know what
specifically has been done.

50:15.092 --> 50:17.919
I think they're gonna start to
actually feel a little better

50:18.219 --> 50:21.745
although they're not gonna be
wild about this in any case.

50:22.205 --> 50:25.212
When they see that the stories
are kind of cleaving to a trend

50:25.611 --> 50:26.532
you know it's not like.

50:26.670 --> 50:28.748
"Here is the list of everybody
who works everywhere."

50:28.838 --> 50:29.627
Right.

50:29.907 --> 50:32.535
I also think you know there're gonna be
paranoid in the extreme

50:32.894 --> 50:34.682
and assuming all kind of
worst case scenarios

50:36.231 --> 50:37.669
which is gonna you know I think

50:37.969 --> 50:42.205
make them react in ways that probably
aren't like gonna be particularly

50:42.574 --> 50:44.533
rational on their part

50:45.611 --> 50:48.279
but at the same time there's...
I do think they're limited

50:48.479 --> 50:49.617
for the moment.

50:49.837 --> 50:54.083
I agree and I mean,
I had kind of time to set a stage where

50:54.413 --> 50:56.770
we all enjoy at least a minimum
level of protection you know

50:56.790 --> 50:59.348
no matter who we are who's involved in this
you know you're either a journalist.

50:59.597 --> 51:00.177
Right

51:00.367 --> 51:01.805
or you're either out of jurisdiction

51:01.895 --> 51:04.533
so we have some time to play this
before they can really get nasty.

51:04.572 --> 51:06.860
I think it's over you know the weeks
when they have times to get lawyers,

51:07.300 --> 51:08.548
really sort of go.

51:08.718 --> 51:12.415
"This is a special situation how can
we interpret this to our advantage?"

51:12.944 --> 51:14.333
like we seen them do this
all the time you know

51:14.752 --> 51:17.100
whether it's drones or wiretapping
or whatever they'll go.

51:17.529 --> 51:20.576
Well according to this law
from the 1840's you know.

51:20.926 --> 51:22.025
Yeah yeah of course

51:22.225 --> 51:22.954
we can apply x, y to the Authority.

51:23.234 --> 51:25.152
But that takes time and
that takes agreement.

51:25.382 --> 51:27.190
Yeah and also you know I mean I think

51:27.490 --> 51:29.897
the more public we are out there
to like as journalists

51:30.816 --> 51:33.164
and the more protection
it's gonna give as well.

51:34.273 --> 51:37.779
Have you started to give thoughts
to when you're ready to come forward?

51:38.349 --> 51:44.023
I'm ready whenever huh honestly
I think there is sort of an agreement

51:44.343 --> 51:46.690
that it's not going to bias
the reporting process.

51:46.990 --> 51:47.899
That's my primary concern at this point.

51:48.139 --> 51:51.675
I don't want to get myself into the issue
before it's gonna happen anyway

51:52.245 --> 51:54.692
and where it takes away
for the stories that are getting out.

52:33.583 --> 52:35.576
We're talking about tens of millions
of Americans

52:37.360 --> 52:38.919
who weren't suspected of doing anything

52:39.178 --> 52:40.726
who were surveilled in this way.

52:41.046 --> 52:43.523
Thoughts for a moment, I want to
continue this conversation,

52:43.563 --> 52:45.282
these are really important sensitive issues

52:45.621 --> 52:48.698
and the public out there has the right
to know what's going on... Stand by...

52:48.998 --> 52:51.545
<font color="#FFFF00">This is CNN breaking news.</font>

52:52.095 --> 52:56.341
<font color="#FFFF00">Another explosive article has just appeared
this time in the Washington Post</font>

52:56.850 --> 53:01.895
<font color="#FFFF00">it's breaking news and it reveals another broad
and secret US government surveillance program.</font>

53:02.375 --> 53:07.160
<font color="#FFFF00">The Washington Post and The Guardian in
London reporting that the NSA and the FBI</font>

53:07.549 --> 53:12.574
<font color="#FFFF00">are tapping directly into the central
servers of nine leading Internet companies</font>

53:13.014 --> 53:18.618
<font color="#FFFF00">including Microsoft, Yahoo, Google,
Facebook, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple.</font>

53:18.918 --> 53:23.324
<font color="#FFFF00">Reports says they're extracting audio,
video, photographs, e-mails, documents</font>

53:23.863 --> 53:29.477
<font color="#FFFF00">and connection logs that enable analysts to track
a person's movements and context over time.</font>

53:31.056 --> 53:33.883
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's discuss this latest revelation
that coming out fast,</font>

53:34.273 --> 53:36.660
<font color="#FFFF00">Bill Binney, the formal official of the NSA</font>

53:36.900 --> 53:39.787
<font color="#FFFF00">who quit back in 2001, you were angry about
what was going on</font>

53:40.187 --> 53:42.026
<font color="#FFFF00">you've been known as
a whistleblower right now.</font>

53:42.195 --> 53:44.512
<font color="#FFFF00">- Bill, what do you think about
this Washington Post story?</font>

53:44.542 --> 53:47.740
<font color="#FFFF00">- Well, I assume it's just the continuation
of what they've been doing all along.</font>

53:47.809 --> 53:48.848
<font color="#FFFF00">- So you're not surprised?</font>

53:49.108 --> 53:49.727
<font color="#FFFF00">- No.</font>

53:49.887 --> 53:51.455
<font color="#FFFF00">- Do you have any idea who's
leaking this information?</font>

53:51.725 --> 53:53.553
<font color="#FFFF00">- I don't know who leaked this,</font>

53:53.863 --> 53:56.920
<font color="#FFFF00">I have no doubt that the administration
will launch an investigation</font>

53:57.919 --> 54:01.955
<font color="#FFFF00">not into who approved these programs
but into who leaked the information.</font>

54:02.694 --> 54:06.001
I'm not shocked they come to
denying it, I don't assume that...

54:06.231 --> 54:07.220
Do you believe it?

54:07.609 --> 54:10.566
<font color="#FFFF00">- There're maybe some technical basis
on which they can say that we are not</font>

54:10.916 --> 54:15.032
<font color="#FFFF00">actively collaborating or they don't have
what we consider in our definition</font>

54:15.332 --> 54:18.438
<font color="#FFFF00">to be direct access to our servers
but what I do know is that I've talked to</font>

54:18.938 --> 54:20.546
<font color="#FFFF00">more that one person</font>

54:20.896 --> 54:25.441
<font color="#FFFF00">who has sat at a desk at a web portal
and typed out commands</font>

54:25.821 --> 54:28.348
<font color="#FFFF00">and reached into those servers
from a distance.</font>

54:29.158 --> 54:31.116
<font color="#FFFF00">So, whatever they want to call that,
that's what's happening.</font>

54:31.545 --> 54:35.501
Hold on, what are we calling the single biggest
infringement on American civil liberties

54:35.911 --> 54:37.469
probably of all time, isn't it?

54:38.029 --> 54:42.225
<font color="#FFFF00">- ...we already have the New York Times now today saying
that the Administration has lost all credibility.</font>

54:42.734 --> 54:44.113
<font color="#FFFF00">- The New York Times slammed
President Obama for this</font>

54:44.512 --> 54:45.711
<font color="#FFFF00">and frankly I was used to that</font>

54:45.821 --> 54:48.968
<font color="#FFFF00">the New York Times used to slam George Bush for
protecting the country for the steps he took.</font>

54:49.367 --> 54:50.727
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't want us to drop our guard.</font>

54:51.026 --> 54:53.803
I don't want us to be struck
again as we saw in Boston,

54:54.053 --> 54:55.062
I understand,

54:55.391 --> 54:59.387
<font color="#FFFF00">people are willing to sacrifice their civil liberties,
people are sheltered inside which is enough...</font>

54:59.447 --> 55:00.746
How can you believe
in freedom, do you see?

55:01.016 --> 55:04.053
I mean try and play the devil's advocate
for me, when you have secret courts,

55:04.203 --> 55:08.558
secret operations like PRISM,
secret investigations which go into

55:08.948 --> 55:12.974
every spit and cough of every American's lives
without any Member of the American public

55:13.363 --> 55:15.082
knowing about it. That's not freedom is it?

55:15.182 --> 55:19.228
<font color="#FFFF00">- In 2008, they eliminated the
warrant requirement for all conversations</font>

55:19.567 --> 55:22.215
<font color="#FFFF00">except ones that takes place
by and among Americans</font>

55:22.624 --> 55:24.332
exclusively on America's soil.

55:24.652 --> 55:27.649
So they don't need warrants now for people
who are foreigners

55:28.049 --> 55:30.996
outside of the US but they also don't need
warrants for Americans

55:31.375 --> 55:33.493
who are in the United States
communicating with people

55:33.833 --> 55:35.911
reasonably believed to be
outside of the US.

55:36.350 --> 55:40.966
So again, the fact that there are no checks, no
oversight about who's looking over the NSA's shoulder,

55:41.285 --> 55:43.933
means that they can take whatever they want
and the fact that it's all behind a wall

55:44.203 --> 55:47.339
of secrecy and they threaten people
who want to expose it

55:47.679 --> 55:50.746
means that whatever they're doing
even violating the law

55:51.126 --> 55:53.673
is something we're unlikely to know
until we start having real investigations

55:54.103 --> 55:57.609
and real transparency into
what it is the government is doing.

55:57.979 --> 56:01.505
<font color="#FFFF00">Glenn Greenwald, congratulations again
on exposing what is a true scandal,</font>

56:01.785 --> 56:02.964
I appreciate you joining me.

56:51.635 --> 56:57.040
Hey I just heard from Lindsay and huh...
she's still alive, which is good and free.

56:58.438 --> 57:01.965
My rent checks apparently are no longer
getting through to my landlord

57:02.474 --> 57:06.470
so they said if we don't pay them
in five days we will be evicted,

57:07.269 --> 57:11.026
which is strange because I got a system
set up that automatically pays them.

57:13.323 --> 57:16.340
So there is that apparently there is
construction trucks all over the street

57:20.057 --> 57:26.001
of my house, so that's, I wonder
what they're looking for.

58:07.939 --> 58:12.884
It is... It is an unusual feeling
that's kind of hard to...

58:14.992 --> 58:18.458
hard to like, describe or convey in words
but not knowing what's gonna happen

58:19.157 --> 58:21.735
in the next days, the next hour
or the next week

58:23.044 --> 58:26.001
it's scary but at the same time
it's liberating, you know,

58:27.749 --> 58:29.867
the planning comes a lot easier
because you don't have

58:29.887 --> 58:32.944
that many variables to take into plate,
you can only act, and then act again.

58:34.362 --> 58:36.480
Now all these phone calls
are being recorded digitally

58:36.960 --> 58:39.347
not for content but
for origin and destination

58:39.727 --> 58:43.493
now word the government is going right into the
servers of these large Internet companies.

58:44.282 --> 58:48.248
How does the government politically speaking
make the argument that this is essential

58:48.658 --> 58:51.085
to National Security and not
a dramatic overreach

58:51.815 --> 58:54.033
in terms of personal privacy?

58:54.312 --> 58:57.329
It's difficult Matt, because
as Peter was pointing out, overnight

58:58.378 --> 59:01.125
we had an extraordinary late night
close to midnight announcement

59:01.395 --> 59:03.993
and a declassification from the
Director of National Intelligence.

59:04.392 --> 59:08.039
They are scrambling, the Administration is
already supported strongly by leaders

59:08.428 --> 59:10.406
in both parties from the
Intelligence Committees.

59:10.896 --> 59:16.260
GCHQ has an internal Wikipedia at the top
secret you know, super classified level

59:17.309 --> 59:19.907
where anybody working intelligence
can work on anything they want.

59:20.566 --> 59:25.031
That's what this is, I'm giving it to you, you can make
the decision on that what's appropriate what's not.

59:25.341 --> 59:27.179
Hum it's gonna be documents of,
you know, different types,

59:27.549 --> 59:30.366
pictures and Power Points and Word documents.
Stuff like that...

59:30.916 --> 59:32.164
Sorry can I take that seat?

59:32.414 --> 59:33.373
Yeah.

59:35.781 --> 59:39.477
Sorry, I'm sorry I've got used to repeat,
so in these documents, they will show...

59:39.707 --> 59:41.405
Yeah there will be
a couple more documents on that,

59:41.705 --> 59:44.602
that's only one part though,
like it talks about Tempora

59:44.862 --> 59:47.389
and a little more thing
that's the wiki article itself.

59:48.438 --> 59:54.352
It was also talking about a self-developed tool
called UDAQ U.D.A.Q. it's their search tool

59:54.592 --> 59:56.940
for all the stuff they collect
was what it looked like.

59:57.239 --> 59:57.739
Yeah.

59:58.078 --> 01:00:00.636
Hum it's gonna be projects,
it's gonna be troubleshooting pages

01:00:00.846 --> 01:00:02.174
for a particular tool.

01:00:02.424 --> 01:00:03.103
Thanks.

01:00:03.793 --> 01:00:07.589
And, the next step,
when do you think you'll go public?

01:00:08.268 --> 01:00:12.934
Arh... I think it's pretty soon, I mean, with
the reaction, this escalated more quickly,

01:00:13.253 --> 01:00:16.011
I think pretty much as soon as they
start trying to make this about me

01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:17.709
which should be any day now.

01:00:17.929 --> 01:00:18.558
Yeah.

01:00:19.167 --> 01:00:24.232
Hum I'll come out just to go hey,
you know, this is not a question of

01:00:24.712 --> 01:00:27.569
somebody skulking around in the shadows.
These are public issues,

01:00:27.959 --> 01:00:30.746
these are not my issues
you know these are everybody's issues,

01:00:31.695 --> 01:00:34.712
I'm not afraid of you, you know,
you're not gonna bully me in the silence

01:00:34.981 --> 01:00:36.740
like you've done to everybody else

01:00:37.329 --> 01:00:38.967
and if no body else is gonna do it I will

01:00:39.966 --> 01:00:42.054
and hopefully when I'm gone
whatever you do to me,

01:00:42.444 --> 01:00:44.603
there will be somebody else
who will do the same thing.

01:00:45.361 --> 01:00:47.919
It will be the sort of Internet principle
you know, of the Hydra:

01:00:48.848 --> 01:00:51.405
You can stop one person
but there is gonna be seven more of us.

01:00:51.675 --> 01:00:52.684
Yeah.

01:00:55.741 --> 01:00:57.499
Are you getting more nervous?

01:01:00.596 --> 01:01:06.210
I mean... no. I think the way
I look at stress... particularly because

01:01:07.429 --> 01:01:13.023
I sort of knew this was coming... because
I sort of volunteered to walk into it.

01:01:16.810 --> 01:01:20.656
I'm already sort of familiar with the idea.

01:01:20.846 --> 01:01:21.924
I'm not worried about it.

01:01:22.244 --> 01:01:24.192
When somebody like
busts in the door suddenly

01:01:24.392 --> 01:01:25.111
I'll get nervous and it'll affect me
but until they do, you know...

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:26.540
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:29.137
But until they do umm... you know.

01:01:29.347 --> 01:01:32.344
I'm eating a little less
that's the only difference I think.

01:01:41.165 --> 01:01:43.804
Let's talk about the issue with
when we're gonna say who you are.

01:01:43.843 --> 01:01:44.392
Yeah.

01:01:44.672 --> 01:01:49.407
This is, you know, you have to talk me through
this because I have a big worry about this.

01:01:49.597 --> 01:01:50.416
OK tell me.

01:01:50.935 --> 01:01:53.992
Which is that...
if we come out and

01:01:55.171 --> 01:01:59.597
I know that you believe
that your detection is inevitable

01:01:59.956 --> 01:02:01.715
and that it's inevitable imminently.

01:02:02.544 --> 01:02:04.871
There is, you know, in the New York Times
today Charlie Savage the fascinating.

01:02:05.621 --> 01:02:08.118
Sherlock Holmes of political
reporting deduced that

01:02:09.297 --> 01:02:10.945
the fact that there has been
these leaks in succession

01:02:11.165 --> 01:02:13.573
probably means that there's some one person
that decided to leak...

01:02:13.803 --> 01:02:16.160
Somebody else quoted you saying
it was one of your readers.

01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:16.740
Yeah.

01:02:17.279 --> 01:02:18.348
And somebody else is putting on things.

01:02:18.628 --> 01:02:22.554
Yeah so you know, I mean it's fine
I want people to, I wanted to be like.

01:02:22.923 --> 01:02:23.423
Yeah.

01:02:23.643 --> 01:02:26.330
You know like this is a person,
I want to start introducing the concept of

01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:29.956
this is a person who has a particular set
of political objectives

01:02:30.316 --> 01:02:32.354
about informing the world about
what's taking place.

01:02:32.654 --> 01:02:35.920
Like you know,
I'm keeping it all anonymous totally

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:39.707
but I want to start introducing you
in that kind of incremental way.

01:02:40.865 --> 01:02:42.044
But here's the thing.

01:02:42.514 --> 01:02:45.221
What I'm concerned about it
that if come out and say

01:02:45.501 --> 01:02:47.619
here's who this is, here's what he did
the whole thing

01:02:47.819 --> 01:02:48.658
that we talked about.

01:02:49.657 --> 01:02:51.095
Then we're gonna basically be doing
the government's work for them

01:02:51.675 --> 01:02:54.492
and we're gonna basically be handing them
you know a confession

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.518
and helping them identify who find it.

01:02:59.037 --> 01:03:01.805
I mean maybe you're right,
maybe they'll find out quickly

01:03:02.054 --> 01:03:04.812
and maybe they'll know but is there
any possible idea that they won't?

01:03:04.971 --> 01:03:08.078
Are we kind of giving them stuff
that we don't...? Or...

01:03:09.377 --> 01:03:11.435
It's possible that they already know
but they don't want to reveal

01:03:11.785 --> 01:03:13.643
it because they don't know...

01:03:13.922 --> 01:03:15.151
Or that they don't know
and we're gonna be telling them like

01:03:15.201 --> 01:03:18.598
is it a possibility that they're gonna
need like 23 months or uncertainty

01:03:18.907 --> 01:03:20.865
and we're gonna be
solving their problem for them?

01:03:21.015 --> 01:03:24.282
Or let me just say the or part
maybe it doesn't matter to you,

01:03:24.542 --> 01:03:27.259
maybe you want it, maybe, I mean,

01:03:27.609 --> 01:03:29.317
you're not coming out because

01:03:29.557 --> 01:03:31.415
you think inevitably
they're gonna catch you

01:03:31.894 --> 01:03:33.014
and you want to do it first,

01:03:33.593 --> 01:03:35.341
you're coming out because
you want to fucking come out and...

01:03:35.701 --> 01:03:37.589
Oh there is that,
I mean that's the thing,

01:03:38.058 --> 01:03:40.016
I don't want to hide on this
and skulk around,

01:03:40.486 --> 01:03:41.685
I don't think I should have to

01:03:42.484 --> 01:03:44.602
obviously there is circumstances
that are saying that.

01:03:44.851 --> 01:03:46.989
I think it is powerful
to come out and be like

01:03:47.419 --> 01:03:50.915
look I'm not afraid and I don't think
other people should either,

01:03:51.165 --> 01:03:53.952
you know, I was sitting
in the office right next to you last week,

01:03:54.292 --> 01:03:56.759
we all have a stake in this,
this is our country

01:03:57.669 --> 01:04:00.885
and the balance of power
between the citizenry and the government

01:04:01.715 --> 01:04:03.802
is becoming that
of the ruling and the ruled

01:04:04.122 --> 01:04:07.739
as opposed to actually, you know,
the elected and the electorate.

01:04:08.228 --> 01:04:11.095
OK so that's what I need to hear,
that this is not about...

01:04:12.154 --> 01:04:15.361
But I do want to say,
I don't think there is a case

01:04:15.661 --> 01:04:18.708
that I'm not gonna be discovered,
in the fullness of time.

01:04:19.197 --> 01:04:20.346
It's just a question of time for me.

01:04:20.606 --> 01:04:22.064
You're right, it could take them
a long time, I don't think it will

01:04:23.223 --> 01:04:26.700
but I didn't try to hide the footprint
because again I intended to come forward.

01:04:27.239 --> 01:04:31.455
OK I'm gonna post this morning
just a general defense of whistleblowers

01:04:31.774 --> 01:04:34.891
and you in particular
without saying anything about you.

01:04:35.231 --> 01:04:36.240
I'm gonna go post
that right when I get back

01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:39.007
and I'm also doing like a big fuck you
to all the people who keep like talking

01:04:39.397 --> 01:04:42.304
about investigations like that.
I want that to be like...

01:04:43.293 --> 01:04:46.000
the fearlessness and the fuck you to like
the bullying tactics,

01:04:47.699 --> 01:04:50.296
has go to be completely preventing
every thing we do.

01:04:50.566 --> 01:04:53.163
I think that's brilliant.
I mean your principles on this I love,

01:04:53.453 --> 01:04:57.828
I can't support them enough because it is,
it's inverting the model

01:04:58.248 --> 01:05:00.606
of the government has laid out
where people where trying to,

01:05:00.815 --> 01:05:03.373
you know, say the truth, skulk around,
and then hide in the dark,

01:05:03.633 --> 01:05:06.680
and then quote anonymously.
I say yes, fuck that, let's just...

01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:10.715
OK, so here is the plan then,
I mean, and this is a thing, it's like

01:05:11.075 --> 01:05:14.252
once, I think we all just felt the fact
that this is the right way to do it.

01:05:15.131 --> 01:05:17.808
You feel the power of your choice,
you know what I mean,

01:05:18.168 --> 01:05:20.556
it's like I want that power
to be felt in the world.

01:05:20.755 --> 01:05:21.355
OK

01:05:22.204 --> 01:05:24.771
And it is the...
it's the ultimate standing up to them

01:05:25.031 --> 01:05:28.158
right like I'm not gonna fucking hide
even for one second,

01:05:29.337 --> 01:05:30.855
I'm gonna get right in your face,

01:05:31.155 --> 01:05:33.593
you don't have to investigate,
there's nothing to investigate,

01:05:33.782 --> 01:05:35.161
here I am!

01:05:35.481 --> 01:05:38.807
You know, and I think that
is just incredibly powerful,

01:05:39.567 --> 01:05:40.926
and then the question just becomes

01:05:41.455 --> 01:05:43.693
how do we do this in the right,
you know the perfect way,

01:05:43.812 --> 01:05:46.570
that's my burden and
that's what I'm gonna spend...

01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:48.947
So today it's gonna be
this story in the morning,

01:05:49.187 --> 01:05:51.125
assuming that
it doesn't change in The Guardian,

01:05:51.365 --> 01:05:52.474
it's gonna be this story in the morning,

01:05:52.634 --> 01:05:55.561
just to keep the mental going,
just to keep like the disclosures coming.

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:58.667
A big one at night, now it's becoming like.

01:05:59.017 --> 01:06:01.465
"OK, this is a major leak"

01:06:01.704 --> 01:06:04.542
and after today when we post
the two stuff things that we're gonna post.

01:06:04.781 --> 01:06:09.117
It's gonna be "what the fuck
is this leak and who did it?"

01:06:09.387 --> 01:06:10.456
I guarantee you.

01:06:20.246 --> 01:06:22.623
I just want to make sure,
move over slightly...

01:06:22.873 --> 01:06:24.672
Do you want me to move
a little move over...

01:06:24.701 --> 01:06:25.980
I just wanna move... all right.

01:06:27.169 --> 01:06:30.076
OK

01:06:30.306 --> 01:06:30.935
We are ready.

01:06:31.155 --> 01:06:32.475
So let's us begin with some basic

01:06:32.554 --> 01:06:33.752
background information like

01:06:34.212 --> 01:06:35.051
just state your name,

01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:37.598
what position you held
in intelligence community

01:06:37.868 --> 01:06:39.896
and how long you worked
within that community.

01:06:41.545 --> 01:06:44.811
OK, uh... just some...
how are we going, like,

01:06:45.291 --> 01:06:46.160
in depth or
are we going like in general,

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.218
like I'm currently
an infrastructure analyst, you know,

01:06:48.518 --> 01:06:50.875
Booz Allen Hamilton,
not going through my whole back story.

01:06:51.315 --> 01:06:51.814
Yes.

01:06:51.934 --> 01:06:52.514
OK,

01:06:52.733 --> 01:06:53.813
Just like summary kind of.

01:06:53.972 --> 01:06:54.601
OK

01:06:54.851 --> 01:06:57.718
My Name is Ed Snowden,
I'm 29 years old,

01:06:58.627 --> 01:07:01.744
I work for Booz Allen Hamilton
as an infrastructure analyst

01:07:01.964 --> 01:07:04.222
for NSA in Hawaii.

01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:08.148
And what are some of the positions
that you held previously

01:07:08.548 --> 01:07:09.926
within the intelligence community?

01:07:10.136 --> 01:07:13.533
I've been a system engineer,
system administrator, uh...

01:07:14.931 --> 01:07:19.896
senior advisor, uh...
for the, Central Intelligence Agency,

01:07:20.206 --> 01:07:23.772
solutions consultant and a
telecommunications information

01:07:23.982 --> 01:07:25.730
systems officer.

01:07:26.729 --> 01:07:29.027
And what kind of clearances have...
have you held,

01:07:29.207 --> 01:07:30.426
what kinda classification?

01:07:31.355 --> 01:07:33.413
Uh... Top secret,

01:07:36.649 --> 01:07:39.726
So, people in my levels of access
for systems administration

01:07:40.366 --> 01:07:44.681
or as a infrastructure analyst
typically have higher accesses

01:07:45.331 --> 01:07:48.228
than an NSA employee would normally have.

01:07:48.677 --> 01:07:51.495
Normal NSA employees have a
combination of clearances called.

01:07:52.294 --> 01:07:55.700
TS SI TK and Gamma.

01:07:57.179 --> 01:08:00.995
Uh, that's a Top Secret Signals
Intelligence Talent Keyhole

01:08:01.415 --> 01:08:02.294
and Gamma.

01:08:02.573 --> 01:08:06.190
And they all relate to certain things
that are sort of core to the NSA mission.

01:08:07.219 --> 01:08:10.146
As a systems administrator
you get a special clearance

01:08:10.476 --> 01:08:12.853
called PrivAcc
for Privileged Access,

01:08:13.233 --> 01:08:17.038
which allows you to be exposed
to informations of any classification

01:08:17.328 --> 01:08:20.156
regardless of what
your position actually needs.

01:08:37.129 --> 01:08:37.627
Monday.

01:08:42.983 --> 01:08:45.660
June 10, 2013.

01:08:55.091 --> 01:08:56.939
Just before we go,
a remind of our top story,

01:08:57.179 --> 01:09:00.296
and that's the full map,
CIA typically worked at Edward Snowden

01:09:00.654 --> 01:09:05.910
says he's responsible for leaking information
that US authorities have been monitoring

01:09:06.310 --> 01:09:08.298
phone and Internet data.

01:09:08.886 --> 01:09:11.544
The US justice deparment confirmed
it is the first stages

01:09:12.174 --> 01:09:14.051
of a criminal investigation.

01:09:14.292 --> 01:09:16.599
Leave it long or got it shorter,
what do you think?

01:09:16.959 --> 01:09:19.805
As far as the video the people saw.
Am I less identifiable now?

01:09:20.066 --> 01:09:20.585
Lose it?

01:09:20.785 --> 01:09:24.272
Lose it? Cause I can't go all the way
down, it's still gonna be stubble.

01:09:24.511 --> 01:09:26.759
I don't have the blade for closer.

01:09:29.037 --> 01:09:31.554
Will you be talking
to any other media about this story today?

01:09:32.254 --> 01:09:32.953
I am.

01:09:34.301 --> 01:09:35.740
Uh, will you be coming to our office

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:38.318
about where is Snowden
now, what his plans are?

01:09:39.216 --> 01:09:41.524
No, I won't talk about that,
so unless you have any other questions...

01:09:41.764 --> 01:09:42.264
OK

01:09:42.643 --> 01:09:45.760
What are you plans please?
Are you staying in Hong Kong

01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:46.799
for a the time being?

01:09:47.019 --> 01:09:47.858
For a little while.

01:09:47.978 --> 01:09:50.585
And do you have any hopes
to write more about this story

01:09:50.835 --> 01:09:52.983
or are you stopping
new writing about this story?

01:09:53.193 --> 01:09:54.332
No, I'm gonna continue
to write about it.

01:09:54.761 --> 01:09:56.759
Have you had any pressure
from the US Authorities

01:09:56.779 --> 01:09:58.258
about continuing to report on this?

01:09:58.437 --> 01:09:59.157
No.

01:09:59.686 --> 01:10:01.724
And have you heard anything about
what could be...

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:05.740
asked you the Hong Kong Authorities
towards this case,

01:10:06.010 --> 01:10:09.208
whether they contacted you or asked you
anything about the whereabouts of Snowden

01:10:09.786 --> 01:10:11.146
and whether that's just another...

01:10:11.554 --> 01:10:14.272
I haven't heard about
the Authorities of any Government.

01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:17.928
And do, where do you think
this story is going then?

01:10:18.258 --> 01:10:22.264
For you and of course for Snowden
and of course for the US media

01:10:22.453 --> 01:10:23.932
and the US Administration in general?

01:10:24.112 --> 01:10:25.830
Uh, for me, I'm gonna continue to report.

01:10:26.399 --> 01:10:30.705
Reporting on what the Government has been doing
and what I think people should know about.

01:10:31.374 --> 01:10:33.273
As for him I don't think anyone knows

01:10:34.142 --> 01:10:39.526
people come after me or any of their third partners you
know they work closely with a number of other nations

01:10:40.515 --> 01:10:45.530
or you know they could pay off the trial
you know any of their agents are assets...

01:11:19.796 --> 01:11:26.709
A criminal investigation the whistleblower...
monitoring phone calls and Internet data goes public...

01:11:28.068 --> 01:11:32.004
Security forces in Afghanistan
say a number of...

01:11:34.921 --> 01:11:38.337
Now it's time for our news paper review
and looking at what's making headlines

01:11:38.787 --> 01:11:39.846
around the world.

01:11:40.266 --> 01:11:45.700
Let's start with The Guardian our top story which is
revealing the identity of the former CIA employee.

01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:51.514
The paper says he leaks information exposing the
scale of American's surveillance of the Internet.

01:11:52.753 --> 01:11:55.011
Edward Snowden,
what a great story...

01:11:56.319 --> 01:11:59.926
Well I think it's a fantastic story this could
be straight out from a John Le CarrÃ© novel

01:12:00.595 --> 01:12:02.874
I mean when you read what he did,
yes he got the material,

01:12:03.482 --> 01:12:07.398
he then decided to go to a place he identified
to be very difficult for America to get at him.

01:12:07.608 --> 01:12:08.637
God dammit

01:12:09.187 --> 01:12:14.192
which is Hong Kong because of course technically
inside China, the one country two systems policy

01:12:14.571 --> 01:12:17.398
there meaning he would get
potentially some protection,

01:12:17.648 --> 01:12:20.895
he thought, all very well planned,
could be just out of a spy novel.

01:12:21.284 --> 01:12:22.673
But what about the details.

01:12:26.839 --> 01:12:34.831
That could make it worse.
But just the lower half of my face.

01:13:09.346 --> 01:13:13.482
Snowden says he'd become increasingly
dismay by what he saw as the growing power

01:13:13.852 --> 01:13:14.881
of the NSA.

01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:18.327
And it's his decision to pass on
documents which is said to reveal

01:13:18.847 --> 01:13:22.863
the organisation monitored
millions of phone calls

01:13:23.103 --> 01:13:25.640
but that it had direct access
to some of the...

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:26.959
How do you feel?

01:13:27.228 --> 01:13:28.627
Internet companies in the world.

01:13:30.086 --> 01:13:32.783
Uuh what happens, happens.
We've uh we've talked about this

01:13:32.993 --> 01:13:36.349
I knew what the risks and if I
get arrested, I get arrested,

01:13:39.586 --> 01:13:43.632
we were able to get the information
that needed to get out, out.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:50.935
And you and Glenn are able to keep
reporting regardless what happens to me.

01:13:53.172 --> 01:13:58.337
Now 29 year old Edward Snowden says that US intelligence
agencies gathered millions of phone records

01:13:59.007 --> 01:14:01.484
and monitored Internet data...

01:14:07.378 --> 01:14:09.166
Yes. I'm sorry who's asking?

01:14:11.834 --> 01:14:16.789
I'm afraid you have the wrong room thank you.
Wall Street Journal.

01:14:32.723 --> 01:14:35.061
Yes. I'm sorry say again?

01:14:36.629 --> 01:14:38.157
Uh, no thank you. No calls.

01:14:38.587 --> 01:14:40.175
I think they have the wrong number.

01:14:41.654 --> 01:14:43.142
Yeah, no calls. Thank you.

01:14:43.482 --> 01:14:49.826
Uh wait I'm sorry if it's two men from the
front desk they can call but no outside calls.

01:14:50.355 --> 01:14:55.290
Wait actually just... let them through.
Wait, wait m'am?

01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:56.299
Fuck.

01:15:03.552 --> 01:15:11.544
Yes. Wait is it a lawyer?
Yeah, no no no I mean,

01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:20.845
the people who are asking. Ask
them if they are lawyers.

01:15:26.889 --> 01:15:29.846
No tell her that she has the wrong number
and there is no Mr. Snowden here.

01:16:09.166 --> 01:16:11.834
Would you mind to talk in speakerphone?

01:16:13.242 --> 01:16:14.041
Sorry.

01:16:18.717 --> 01:16:19.517
Hi. I'm the client.

01:16:21.824 --> 01:16:23.812
Pretty good. I'm doing well.

01:16:40.305 --> 01:16:40.805
Ok.

01:16:46.329 --> 01:16:46.979
Ok.

01:16:58.187 --> 01:17:03.842
Ok, that's great. Is it OK if I bring equipment? Because
I'm just kind of going, so I can leave in any direction,

01:17:04.111 --> 01:17:06.689
at any time, and not come back.
If necessary.

01:17:17.508 --> 01:17:18.697
Ok, that sounds good.

01:17:20.285 --> 01:17:22.124
Thank you, thank you
so much for helping us.

01:18:04.761 --> 01:18:08.727
Yeah... And so, is there a precedent for
this where Hong Kong would extradite someone

01:18:08.986 --> 01:18:10.495
for political speech?

01:19:17.808 --> 01:19:20.055
"The President surely does not welcome
the way that this debate"

01:19:20.205 --> 01:19:21.963
has earned a greater attention
the last week,

01:19:22.433 --> 01:19:25.640
the leaked classified information about
sensitive programs that are

01:19:25.909 --> 01:19:27.618
important in our
fight against terrorists

01:19:27.957 --> 01:19:30.375
who would do harm
to Americans is a problem,

01:19:31.694 --> 01:19:35.240
but the debate itself is legitimate
and should be engaged.

01:23:25.959 --> 01:23:28.257
Right, so which one do we want here then.

01:23:28.457 --> 01:23:30.944
This is operational stuff,
so we mustn't say any of this.

01:23:31.194 --> 01:23:32.133
So redact that.

01:23:32.632 --> 01:23:33.951
Go near the top.

01:23:34.181 --> 01:23:35.989
What about the Alexander's quote,
is that something...

01:23:36.219 --> 01:23:39.995
Yeah. That's in TARMAC. "Why can't we
collect all the signals all the times?"

01:23:40.195 --> 01:23:43.362
Sounds like a good
summer homework project for Menwith".

01:23:43.601 --> 01:23:46.668
Keith Alexander the head of the NSA
on a visit to the UK. This one.

01:23:47.078 --> 01:23:47.907
Yeah.

01:23:48.157 --> 01:23:51.534
Yeah. It's a secret document
in that secret document.

01:23:51.773 --> 01:23:55.480
We've got a stick here that should
just have three single slides on it.

01:23:55.749 --> 01:23:59.306
If it's got more than three single slides,
we have to be extremely careful.

01:24:02.313 --> 01:24:02.812
Yeah?

01:24:02.962 --> 01:24:04.011
Yeah, that's it.

01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:07.128
This is really dangerous
stuff for us, Guardian.

01:24:07.398 --> 01:24:09.645
If we make mistakes, ...very angry.

01:24:09.995 --> 01:24:13.322
We kept it all under lock and key
and no one knows. No, I'm not saying that.

01:24:14.521 --> 01:24:15.090
OK

01:24:15.370 --> 01:24:18.327
They will come in and snap the front
door down if we elaborate on that...

01:24:19.116 --> 01:24:19.855
And he said...

01:24:20.225 --> 01:24:22.852
The Prime Minister is extremely
concerned about this.

01:24:23.152 --> 01:24:25.160
And they kept saying, "this
is from the very top."

01:25:36.598 --> 01:25:39.086
As you can see on this map the flight
that probably has Snowden aboard,

01:25:39.306 --> 01:25:42.158
has almost reached its destination here
in Moscow's scheduled plan,

01:25:42.832 --> 01:25:44.700
in the Russian capital within minutes...

01:25:46.279 --> 01:25:51.329
As you may have heard, there is a CIA agent
who has revealed a lot of information

01:25:53.112 --> 01:25:54.261
and he is now trapped in the

01:25:56.349 --> 01:25:57.497
airport in Moscow.

01:25:58.407 --> 01:25:59.966
We managed to get him out of Hong Kong,

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:02.073
but when he landed in the Moscow airport,

01:26:02.772 --> 01:26:06.658
the American government had
canceled his passport.

01:26:07.058 --> 01:26:09.705
So formally he hasn't entered
into Russian territory,

01:26:10.035 --> 01:26:11.673
he is in the transit area of the airport.

01:26:13.421 --> 01:26:15.849
And one of our people is accompanying him.

01:26:16.179 --> 01:26:18.626
We are trying to arrange a private jet

01:26:20.434 --> 01:26:25.000
to take him from Moscow

01:26:25.959 --> 01:26:30.874
to Ecuador or perhaps maybe Venezuela

01:26:31.124 --> 01:26:32.133
or maybe Iceland,

01:26:32.992 --> 01:26:34.480
countries where he would be safe.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.546
May I collect all the phones please?

01:30:15.759 --> 01:30:17.677
I have everything in here.

01:30:19.825 --> 01:30:22.372
Put them in the refrigerator.

01:30:33.152 --> 01:30:35.409
So, as you know, in June,

01:30:35.819 --> 01:30:39.136
Snowden was in charge with 3

01:30:39.525 --> 01:30:40.564
legal violations felonies.

01:30:42.192 --> 01:30:44.400
Principaly under a World War I era

01:30:45.379 --> 01:30:47.028
criminal law called the Espionage Act.

01:30:48.756 --> 01:30:51.074
The Espionage Act is an extremely broad

01:30:51.713 --> 01:30:52.852
criminal prohibition against

01:30:54.111 --> 01:30:55.849
the sharing or dissemination

01:30:56.458 --> 01:30:58.297
of what's called
"National Defense information"

01:30:58.816 --> 01:31:01.373
it was only used to

01:31:01.713 --> 01:31:03.811
prosecute people who had been accused of

01:31:04.091 --> 01:31:07.257
acting with a foreign power,
spies not whistleblowers

01:31:07.657 --> 01:31:09.775
and it's a very unusual legal
representation I think

01:31:10.284 --> 01:31:12.962
not just for all of you,
but for me as well.

01:31:13.791 --> 01:31:16.918
The Espionage Act has not
distinguished between

01:31:17.337 --> 01:31:19.205
leaks to the press
and the public interest,

01:31:19.695 --> 01:31:21.843
and selling secrets to foreign enemies

01:31:22.412 --> 01:31:23.921
for personal profit.

01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:25.929
So, under the Espionage Act

01:31:26.168 --> 01:31:29.275
it's not a defense if the
information that was disclosed

01:31:29.545 --> 01:31:31.683
should not have been withheld
in the first place,

01:31:31.923 --> 01:31:33.282
that it was improperly classified.

01:31:33.621 --> 01:31:36.798
It's not a defense if the
dissemination was in the public interest

01:31:37.227 --> 01:31:38.426
that it led to reforms.

01:31:38.926 --> 01:31:42.432
Even if the court determines
that the programs that were revealed

01:31:42.732 --> 01:31:44.360
were illegal or unconstitutional.

01:31:44.620 --> 01:31:46.878
That's still not a defense
under the Espionage Act,

01:31:47.127 --> 01:31:49.915
the Government doesn't have
to defend the classification,

01:31:50.234 --> 01:31:53.181
it doesn't have to demonstrate
harm from the release,

01:31:53.621 --> 01:31:55.439
All this is irrelevant.

01:31:55.929 --> 01:31:58.596
So when we say that
the trial wouldn't be fair,

01:31:59.495 --> 01:32:01.763
we are not talking about
what human rights lawyers think

01:32:02.043 --> 01:32:03.411
of this fair trial practices.

01:32:03.721 --> 01:32:05.409
We are saying the law, the statute itself,

01:32:06.798 --> 01:32:09.145
eliminates any kind of defense

01:32:09.495 --> 01:32:11.163
that Snowden might be able to make

01:32:11.573 --> 01:32:13.861
and essentially will equate him with a spy.

01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:18.506
And of course those three counts could be
increased to a hundreed or two hundreed

01:32:18.806 --> 01:32:20.484
or three hundreed, they
could charge him separately

01:32:20.754 --> 01:32:23.871
for each document that has been
published by a journalist.

01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:27.247
And I think that we all recognize,
even though we sit here as lawyers

01:32:28.786 --> 01:32:29.665
in a lawyer's meeting

01:32:30.464 --> 01:32:34.740
that it's propably
95% politics and 5% law.

01:32:35.429 --> 01:32:37.427
How this would be resolved.

01:33:09.185 --> 01:33:12.382
"Mr. Snowden has been charged
with very serious crimes"

01:33:13.171 --> 01:33:16.688
and he should be returned to the United States
where he would be granted full due process

01:33:16.798 --> 01:33:20.304
and every right available to him
as a United States citizen.

01:33:21.563 --> 01:33:24.420
"Facing our justice system
under the Constitution."

01:34:15.549 --> 01:34:17.307
No, I don't think
Mr. Snowden was a Patriot.

01:34:17.417 --> 01:34:19.875
I called for a federal review

01:34:20.664 --> 01:34:23.411
of our surveillance operations

01:34:23.891 --> 01:34:26.358
before Mr. Snowden made these leaks.

01:34:26.698 --> 01:34:28.286
My preference,

01:34:29.954 --> 01:34:31.423
and I think the American
people's preference,

01:34:31.633 --> 01:34:35.149
would have been for a lawful, orderly

01:34:35.489 --> 01:34:37.767
examination of these laws.

01:34:38.456 --> 01:34:43.101
A thoughtful, fact based debate,

01:34:43.591 --> 01:34:46.768
that would then lead us to a better place.

01:35:28.256 --> 01:35:30.903
Oh my God. David. Hello my baby.

01:35:32.242 --> 01:35:32.822
I'm OK.

01:35:33.051 --> 01:35:34.270
You're OK?

01:35:38.995 --> 01:35:39.915
I just wanna go home.

01:35:40.474 --> 01:35:43.461
OK, OK OK. You just have to walk...

01:35:50.344 --> 01:35:51.413
How are you?

01:35:51.743 --> 01:35:54.110
Good, good. I'm totally fine, I
didn't sleep at all, I couldn't sleep.

01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:55.309
I know.

01:35:55.559 --> 01:36:00.154
"Brazil Demands Explanation
from UK Government."

01:36:17.617 --> 01:36:21.683
Recent reports have revealed that the NSA
have access to encryption keys

01:36:22.042 --> 01:36:25.299
and they paid tech companies to introduce
backdoors in encryption protocols.

01:36:26.078 --> 01:36:30.803
So we are going to talk about ways in which
we can defend ourselves against

01:36:31.143 --> 01:36:33.171
governments spying on us.

01:36:33.421 --> 01:36:37.057
So Mr. Jacob Appelbaum, as an encryption
and security software developper,

01:36:37.267 --> 01:36:38.376
and journalist.

01:36:38.736 --> 01:36:41.922
Ladar Levison, the founder of the
encrypted email service.

01:36:42.392 --> 01:36:43.741
Lavabit

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.059
used by Edward Snowden.

01:36:45.239 --> 01:36:45.998
You have the floor.

01:36:46.358 --> 01:36:47.267
Thank you.

01:36:47.417 --> 01:36:50.064
Lavabit is an email service
that hopefully one day

01:36:50.314 --> 01:36:55.848
will be able to stand on its own
without any references to Snowden.

01:36:56.158 --> 01:36:59.095
My service was designed to remove me

01:36:59.375 --> 01:37:02.242
from the possibility of being forced

01:37:02.482 --> 01:37:04.500
to violate a person's privacy.

01:37:04.849 --> 01:37:05.739
Quite simply.

01:37:06.108 --> 01:37:08.266
Lavabit was designed to
remove the service provider

01:37:08.536 --> 01:37:09.784
from the equation,

01:37:10.224 --> 01:37:12.252
by not having logs on my server

01:37:12.612 --> 01:37:15.958
and not having access to
a person's emails on disk,

01:37:16.238 --> 01:37:17.277
I wasn't elimitating

01:37:17.547 --> 01:37:18.825
the possibility of surveillance,

01:37:18.995 --> 01:37:22.052
I was simply removing myself
from that equation.

01:37:23.331 --> 01:37:24.979
And that surveillance
would have to be conducted

01:37:25.159 --> 01:37:26.578
on the target

01:37:26.867 --> 01:37:27.966
either the sender

01:37:28.166 --> 01:37:29.884
or the receiver of the messages.

01:37:30.624 --> 01:37:34.030
But I was approached
by the FBI quite recently,

01:37:34.230 --> 01:37:35.349
and told

01:37:35.918 --> 01:37:38.026
that because I couldn't
turn over the information

01:37:38.306 --> 01:37:40.014
from that one particular user,

01:37:40.254 --> 01:37:42.322
I would be forced to
give up those SSL keys

01:37:42.562 --> 01:37:44.470
and let the FBI
collect every communication

01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:47.027
on my network without
any kind of transparency.

01:37:48.406 --> 01:37:50.374
And of course,

01:37:50.674 --> 01:37:52.242
I wasn't comfortable with that,

01:37:52.731 --> 01:37:53.890
to say the least!

01:37:54.630 --> 01:37:58.955
More disturbing was the fact that I couldn't
even tell anybody that it was going on.

01:37:59.515 --> 01:38:01.183
So I decided:

01:38:01.433 --> 01:38:04.250
"If I didn't win the
fight to unseal my case,"

01:38:04.650 --> 01:38:05.878
if I didn't win the battle

01:38:06.248 --> 01:38:08.775
to be able to tell people
what was going on,

01:38:09.774 --> 01:38:12.432
then my only ethical choice left
was to shutdown...

01:38:14.799 --> 01:38:16.917
Think about that.

01:38:17.597 --> 01:38:21.892
I believe in the rule of law, I believe
in the need to conduct investigations,

01:38:22.961 --> 01:38:26.678
but those investigations
are supposed to be difficult for a reason.

01:38:27.047 --> 01:38:30.853
It's supposed to be difficult
to invade somebody's privacy.

01:38:31.133 --> 01:38:33.511
Because of how intrusive it is,

01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:36.088
because of how disruptive it is.

01:38:36.528 --> 01:38:39.065
If we can't, if we don't have
a right to privacy,

01:38:39.405 --> 01:38:42.162
how do we have
a free and open discussion?

01:38:42.462 --> 01:38:44.729
What good is the right
to free speech,

01:38:47.197 --> 01:38:49.505
if it's not protected,

01:38:49.804 --> 01:38:51.992
in a sense that you can't have
a private discussion

01:38:52.372 --> 01:38:55.009
with somebody else
about something you disagree with.

01:38:55.748 --> 01:38:57.756
Think about the chilling effect
that that has.

01:38:58.576 --> 01:39:00.294
Think about the chilling effect
it does have

01:39:00.494 --> 01:39:03.511
on countries that don't have
a right to privacy.

01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:05.878
I've noticed a really interesting
discussion point

01:39:06.238 --> 01:39:08.517
which is that what people used to call
liberty and freedom

01:39:08.735 --> 01:39:10.094
we now call privacy.

01:39:11.123 --> 01:39:12.951
And we say in the same breath

01:39:13.351 --> 01:39:14.869
that privacy is dead.

01:39:15.409 --> 01:39:17.357
This is something
that really concerns me

01:39:17.597 --> 01:39:18.635
about my generation

01:39:18.915 --> 01:39:21.513
especially when we talk about
how we're not surprised by anything.

01:39:21.822 --> 01:39:23.291
I think that we should consider that

01:39:23.601 --> 01:39:25.569
when we lose privacy we lose agency,

01:39:25.858 --> 01:39:26.997
we lose liberty itself

01:39:27.277 --> 01:39:29.535
because we no longer feel free
to express what we think.

01:39:30.244 --> 01:39:32.362
There is this myth of
the passive surveillance machine

01:39:32.631 --> 01:39:35.299
but actually what is surveillance
except control?

01:39:35.858 --> 01:39:37.477
This notion that the NSA are passive

01:39:37.746 --> 01:39:38.556
this is nonsense

01:39:38.815 --> 01:39:40.004
what we see is that they actively attack.

01:39:40.354 --> 01:39:42.062
European citizens, American citizens and,

01:39:43.081 --> 01:39:44.450
in fact, anyone that they can

01:39:44.689 --> 01:39:45.888
if they perceive an advantage.

01:41:22.611 --> 01:41:24.579
OK. Right.

01:41:30.144 --> 01:41:32.492
I have to give that in testimony.

01:41:32.871 --> 01:41:34.230
What are you going to tell?

01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:37.726
Everything I can truthfully.

01:41:38.196 --> 01:41:40.144
What will you talk about?

01:41:40.474 --> 01:41:42.971
Uh, whatever the questions they ask me.

01:41:43.231 --> 01:41:44.130
Yeah I think it's over there.

01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:47.536
Ok, it's alright. Thank you.

01:41:54.030 --> 01:41:55.329
Hey, how are you?

01:41:55.469 --> 01:41:56.108
Good.

01:41:56.318 --> 01:41:56.878
How are you?

01:41:57.007 --> 01:41:57.566
Good to see you again.

01:41:57.736 --> 01:41:58.935
Nice to meet you again, yes.

01:42:00.434 --> 01:42:01.393
Yeah.

01:43:30.194 --> 01:43:34.060
What do you think they're doing to reporters,
those of us that are working directly with...

01:43:34.669 --> 01:43:35.978
Snowden documents?

01:43:36.228 --> 01:43:38.276
How do you think they would approach
dealing with people like us?

01:43:38.555 --> 01:43:41.692
You're.. You're on a
cast iron cover list.

01:43:42.342 --> 01:43:45.618
Which means any electronic device you use

01:43:46.278 --> 01:43:49.036
that they can attach to you
they all record and capture all that data.

01:43:49.974 --> 01:43:52.112
And what do they do with that data? They're
just trying to figure out what we're doing?

01:43:53.380 --> 01:43:55.209
Uh, well the primary...

01:43:55.388 --> 01:43:57.087
That's part of it. But the
other part, primarily part,

01:43:57.456 --> 01:43:59.594
is for them. I think it's to find the
sources of information you're getting.

01:44:00.204 --> 01:44:03.990
So if I have a confidential source who's
giving me information as a whistleblower,

01:44:04.649 --> 01:44:07.376
and he works within the US Government,
and he's concerned about

01:44:07.806 --> 01:44:10.623
what he perceives as
violation of the Constitution,

01:44:11.153 --> 01:44:13.211
uhm... and he gets in touch with me,
they...

01:44:13.470 --> 01:44:14.050
Yeah...

01:44:14.389 --> 01:44:15.149
Go ahead. Yeah.

01:44:15.408 --> 01:44:18.785
Yeah. From there on, they would nail him
and start watching everything he did.

01:44:20.643 --> 01:44:22.751
And if you start passing data,
I'm sure they'd take him off the street.

01:44:23.021 --> 01:44:26.188
I mean, the way you have to do it
is like Deep Throat did, right?

01:44:26.557 --> 01:44:30.034
In the Nixon years,
meet in a basement of a parking garage...

01:44:30.813 --> 01:44:32.082
physically.

01:45:13.001 --> 01:45:15.378
Let's disassociate our
metadata one last time.

01:45:15.718 --> 01:45:18.995
So we don't have a clear record of your
true name in our final communication chain.

01:45:21.113 --> 01:45:23.670
This is obviously not to say
you can't claim your involvement,

01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:26.757
but as every trick in the book
is likely to be used and looking into this,

01:45:27.476 --> 01:45:29.864
I believe it's better,
that that particular disclosure

01:45:30.064 --> 01:45:31.592
come on your own terms.

01:45:32.042 --> 01:45:34.489
Thank you again for all you've done.

01:45:34.749 --> 01:45:36.527
So sorry again for the multiple delays.

01:45:36.707 --> 01:45:38.226
But we've been entering a territory

01:45:38.635 --> 01:45:39.914
with no model to benefit from.

01:45:41.462 --> 01:45:42.891
If all ends well,

01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:45.408
perhaps the demonstration
that our mess has worked

01:45:45.918 --> 01:45:47.616
would embolden more to come forward.

01:45:48.565 --> 01:45:49.864
Citizen.

01:45:54.849 --> 01:45:58.755
So the update that I want
to give you is about the new,

01:46:00.663 --> 01:46:02.741
uh.. the new source that, that we...

01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:05.199
OK.

01:46:07.936 --> 01:46:11.282
That... uh, this is what...
this is the...

01:46:11.812 --> 01:46:15.438
you know this is the person who is doing
the... the most of the...

01:46:15.608 --> 01:46:16.657
Right, right, right.

01:46:17.017 --> 01:46:20.633
The work on it, uh...
And now... and now,

01:46:20.813 --> 01:46:22.541
what basically, what happens is...

01:46:25.508 --> 01:46:26.267
and...

01:46:27.107 --> 01:46:29.524
That's actually...
That's really dangerous...

01:46:31.173 --> 01:46:32.801
uh, on the source's side.

01:46:33.121 --> 01:46:34.369
Do they know how to
take care of themselves...

01:46:34.589 --> 01:46:35.588
Well he knows...

01:46:36.757 --> 01:46:37.256
or do you know anything about...

01:46:37.626 --> 01:46:38.625
he means it's, uh...

01:46:40.533 --> 01:46:42.102
It's all being done..
Through this...

01:46:42.331 --> 01:46:43.031
OK.

01:46:43.530 --> 01:46:46.657
And they're all talking this way...

01:46:46.977 --> 01:46:47.716
OK.

01:46:48.106 --> 01:46:48.945
And, uh...

01:46:49.234 --> 01:46:51.622
I was gonna say
one of the big questions there is:

01:46:51.952 --> 01:46:53.350
Can they handle it?
You know with...

01:46:53.570 --> 01:46:55.149
Yeah, they're very careful...

01:46:55.718 --> 01:46:56.757
even they're through that.

01:46:56.967 --> 01:46:57.736
OK

01:46:58.006 --> 01:46:58.715
Yeah.

01:47:02.731 --> 01:47:04.189
And...

01:47:10.933 --> 01:47:13.560
That's what that is.

01:47:14.869 --> 01:47:16.357
Wow, that's really something.

01:47:20.763 --> 01:47:22.102
Oh, oh...

01:47:29.574 --> 01:47:30.633
Did you know that?

01:47:31.113 --> 01:47:38.096
One key thing: ALL drone strikes are done through
Ramstein Air Base in Germany - German govt has always.

01:47:38.325 --> 01:47:39.624
It's not the actual plan.

01:47:40.293 --> 01:47:42.012
Right, right right. You mean the control.

01:47:42.131 --> 01:47:43.731
It's the process, who's sending the...

01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:44.759
Yeah.

01:47:45.148 --> 01:47:49.394
There's a... There's a chart.
You know, it goes like a whole layout in it

01:47:49.604 --> 01:47:50.573
for everyone and it's...

01:47:50.793 --> 01:47:52.112
Yeah. It's really bold,
but it's really risky.

01:47:52.551 --> 01:47:54.269
But you know that... that's the thing if...

01:47:54.309 --> 01:47:55.009
There's more...

01:47:55.238 --> 01:47:56.147
if they understand
what they're doing.

01:47:56.637 --> 01:48:00.773
There's this chart, it goes like this...
It shows the decision making chart.

01:48:01.053 --> 01:48:07.386
It's a chart... It's, it's...
it's shaped like this.

01:48:10.333 --> 01:48:10.973
- Hum hum...
- So up here it says "POTUS" (President of the Uniteed States)

01:48:11.242 --> 01:48:13.890
That's the decision making
chart for each... one.

01:48:19.124 --> 01:48:19.624
And...

01:48:19.874 --> 01:48:21.352
And it's so political...

01:48:21.582 --> 01:48:25.498
This is... This part's amazing.

01:48:29.594 --> 01:48:30.643
That's...

01:48:30.983 --> 01:48:32.871
That's fucking ridiculous.

01:48:33.790 --> 01:48:35.448
This... This is... it's so shocking.

01:48:38.225 --> 01:48:40.603
(laugh) That's...

01:48:42.261 --> 01:48:42.861
No, I know...

01:48:42.971 --> 01:48:43.470
That's...

01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:44.099
I know...

01:48:44.719 --> 01:48:47.116
There are 1.2 m people on various stages
of their watch list.

01:48:47.506 --> 01:48:49.304
The population of an entire country.

01:48:49.734 --> 01:48:50.573
I know.

01:48:50.883 --> 01:48:54.139
That's... what we're working on.

01:49:04.139 --> 01:49:06.797
That person is incredibly
bold, but, uh...

01:49:07.676 --> 01:49:09.124
But also very well aware.

01:49:09.534 --> 01:49:11.373
Right. I... You know, I just hope.
I mean...

01:49:12.051 --> 01:49:12.941
No, I mean...

01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:15.348
the boldness of it is shocking,
but I mean it was obviously..

01:49:15.798 --> 01:49:17.486
But the other thing is just...

01:49:17.796 --> 01:49:19.554
motivated by what you did,
I mean, it...

01:49:19.584 --> 01:49:21.272
This is going to... This is going to...

01:49:21.922 --> 01:49:23.750
That could raise a profile

01:49:24.659 --> 01:49:25.979
of this whole political situation

01:49:26.227 --> 01:49:28.515
with whistleblowing
to a whole new level, because...

01:49:28.825 --> 01:49:29.434
exactly...

01:49:29.784 --> 01:49:30.873
It's gonna...

01:49:31.122 --> 01:49:31.922
Yeah, I mean...

01:49:32.131 --> 01:49:33.610
I actually think
that's a great thing.

01:49:33.820 --> 01:49:35.979
And I think people
are gonna see what's being hidden...

01:49:36.547 --> 01:49:40.343
again, again..
By a totally different part.

01:49:43.050 --> 01:49:46.267
POTUS

01:49:47.305 --> 01:49:53.268
