00:36.707 --> 00:38.509
What the...

00:41.642 --> 00:44.645
(Police radio chatter)

00:46.477 --> 00:48.178
Brought you some coffee.

00:48.179 --> 00:50.420
I figured I wasn't the
only one who could use it.

00:50.421 --> 00:52.682
Well, thank you, partner.

00:52.683 --> 00:55.054
(Chuckles) Well, at
least we didn't dress alike.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.556
Well, I thought about that,

00:56.557 --> 00:58.528
but plum doesn't
really work for me.

00:58.529 --> 01:00.560
Mm-hmm.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.562
(Megan) Where's bud?

01:02.563 --> 01:04.063
Oh, he's running behind.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.065
Jeannie's having a bad
case of morning sickness.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.098
Just tell him to stay home.

01:08.099 --> 01:09.439
It's just one dealer
doing another.

01:09.440 --> 01:11.171
And you know that why?

01:11.172 --> 01:12.402
I'm guessing because
we've worked this area

01:12.403 --> 01:13.473
a lot longer than you.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.275
Ah. Actually, he's right.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.507
No one comes down here
except for dealers and addicts.

01:17.508 --> 01:20.410
Well, he certainly
wasn't dumped here.

01:20.411 --> 01:22.452
Any I.D.?

01:22.453 --> 01:24.254
(Peter) Uh, yeah.
Driver's license.

01:24.255 --> 01:26.286
Johnny vasquez,

01:26.287 --> 01:29.219
age 37, from Camden.

01:29.220 --> 01:31.121
Did you see that
sawdust on his boots?

01:31.122 --> 01:32.162
Yeah, we're, uh,
canvassing the area

01:32.163 --> 01:34.494
for construction sites now.

01:34.495 --> 01:37.827
Muzzle imprint,
stellate laceration,

01:37.828 --> 01:39.429
powder burns around
the entry wound.

01:39.430 --> 01:43.233
And we have a...

01:43.234 --> 01:46.336
White gold charm with
the number 3 on it...

01:46.337 --> 01:47.807
(Rustles paper)

01:47.808 --> 01:49.679
And a New York phone number.

01:49.680 --> 01:53.583
Hard contact, penetrating
gunshot wound...

01:53.584 --> 01:56.247
This was an execution.

01:59.690 --> 02:02.422
(Megan) The bullet
fragmented upon impact.

02:02.423 --> 02:04.224
That helps explain the
raccooning of the eyes.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.796
Ballistics is gonna have
a field day with this one.

02:06.797 --> 02:09.128
I have a small laceration
in the mid-knuckle...

02:09.129 --> 02:10.730
(Camera shutter
clicks) Of the right hand.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.862
(Clicks) Looks inflamed.

02:12.863 --> 02:14.164
Maybe he put up a fight.

02:14.165 --> 02:15.305
Not last night. That's
a couple of days old.

02:15.306 --> 02:17.207
Detective, no food or drink.

02:17.208 --> 02:18.208
You know that.

02:18.209 --> 02:21.311
(Sighs)

02:21.312 --> 02:23.313
How's Jeannie? Feeling better?

02:23.314 --> 02:25.315
If by better you mean
exhausted and peeing all the time,

02:25.316 --> 02:26.476
she's great.

02:26.477 --> 02:28.248
Is she drinking a lot of fluids?

02:28.249 --> 02:30.280
Orange juice, 2 gallons a day.

02:30.281 --> 02:31.481
Weight gain?

02:31.482 --> 02:33.783
You trying to get me killed?

02:33.784 --> 02:35.225
Can we stick to the
business at hand?

02:35.226 --> 02:37.257
(Ethan) He has receding
gums, which suggests

02:37.258 --> 02:39.259
chronic drug abuse.
Help me roll him.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.291
(Morris clears throat)
He is a drug dealer.

02:41.292 --> 02:42.492
That much we know.

02:42.493 --> 02:44.294
Spent some time in prison.

02:44.295 --> 02:45.395
Currently on parole.

02:45.396 --> 02:46.736
(Megan) There's some
kind of white powder

02:46.737 --> 02:48.798
on his posterior neck.

02:48.799 --> 02:51.271
Looks like some hairs.

02:51.272 --> 02:53.344
Hmm.

02:55.776 --> 02:57.907
Three of 'em.

02:57.908 --> 02:59.679
Well, since he's so...

02:59.680 --> 03:01.881
Follicularly challenged,

03:01.882 --> 03:06.417
I would assume that the
hairs are from the killer, right?

03:11.262 --> 03:12.762
(Grunts)

03:12.763 --> 03:15.194
Now let me guess.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.926
You want me to
run that to the lab,

03:16.927 --> 03:18.699
put it through codis, right?

03:20.200 --> 03:22.632
Thank you.

03:22.633 --> 03:24.675
I told you, detective.

03:27.278 --> 03:29.279
How do you women do it?

03:29.280 --> 03:30.440
How do we do what?

03:30.441 --> 03:31.911
Survive pregnancy.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.583
There are days
that Jeannie would...

03:33.584 --> 03:35.385
Trade places with this guy.

03:35.386 --> 03:37.587
Well, hopefully, she
has a good partner.

03:37.588 --> 03:39.389
(Peter) So crime lab said that

03:39.390 --> 03:40.690
the sawdust found
on vasquez's boots

03:40.691 --> 03:42.221
is not natural.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.393
It's compressed.

03:43.394 --> 03:44.894
And that is interesting how?

03:44.895 --> 03:47.257
You obviously don't
spend time in dive bars.

03:47.258 --> 03:50.430
They use sawdust to
clean up spilled beer.

03:50.431 --> 03:53.363
I know at least two
near the crime scene.

03:53.364 --> 03:56.606
(Bottles clink)

03:56.607 --> 03:59.969
Excuse me. You
know Johnny vasquez?

03:59.970 --> 04:02.612
Yeah, he's the bar manager.

04:02.613 --> 04:04.814
He should be in around noon.

04:04.815 --> 04:07.447
Afraid he won't be. Johnny
was murdered last night.

04:07.448 --> 04:08.878
(Sighs)

04:08.879 --> 04:09.879
Oh, my god.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.521
Look at me.

04:11.522 --> 04:13.723
Your eyes are glassy,
your pupils are dilated.

04:13.724 --> 04:14.724
You're high, aren't you?

04:14.725 --> 04:16.626
No.

04:16.627 --> 04:17.987
Was Johnny your dealer?

04:17.988 --> 04:19.389
J-Johnny's really dead?

04:19.390 --> 04:20.890
It hurts, I know.

04:20.891 --> 04:22.692
Now you're gonna
have to find another one.

04:22.693 --> 04:25.495
Johnny looked after me.

04:25.496 --> 04:27.297
He was gonna
introduce me to this guy

04:27.298 --> 04:29.399
that he knew in
the music business

04:29.400 --> 04:30.470
to start my career.

04:30.471 --> 04:32.872
Um, I sing, you know?

04:32.873 --> 04:34.304
Sublimely, I'm sure.

04:34.305 --> 04:36.045
Now who else was he supplying?

04:36.046 --> 04:37.707
I-I don't know
anything about that.

04:37.708 --> 04:39.409
Yep, all right.

04:39.410 --> 04:40.580
No, no, I tell you what,

04:40.581 --> 04:41.911
why don't you give us the names

04:41.912 --> 04:43.913
of everyone you know that
had dealings with Johnny,

04:43.914 --> 04:45.415
and we won't arrest you?

04:45.416 --> 04:47.417
(Billiard balls clatter)

04:47.418 --> 04:49.419
(People speak indistinctly)

04:49.420 --> 04:52.362
Prison records show
that the wrist fracture

04:52.363 --> 04:53.993
was from a fight
nine months ago,

04:53.994 --> 04:55.325
just before he got out.

04:55.326 --> 04:56.826
Autopsy was unremarkable.

04:56.827 --> 04:58.468
This guy was no drug addict.

04:58.469 --> 04:59.629
(Ethan) Which is weird,

04:59.630 --> 05:02.432
because prelim tox results
were positive for cannabis,

05:02.433 --> 05:05.635
cocaine metabolites,
and methadone.

05:05.636 --> 05:08.608
Methadone to kick a
heroin habit he didn't have?

05:08.609 --> 05:10.640
Check out this white
powder on his neck.

05:10.641 --> 05:12.311
It's a mixture

05:12.312 --> 05:13.913
of magnesium
oxide and cornstarch.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.486
It's used in latex gloves
to prevent stickiness.

05:16.487 --> 05:18.087
Gentlemen, we have a puzzle...

05:18.088 --> 05:20.350
A drug dealer with
drugs in his system

05:20.351 --> 05:22.722
who didn't abuse drugs.

05:22.723 --> 05:25.054
Look, I've been trying to
get ahold of his parole officer.

05:25.055 --> 05:27.458
Maybe that'll shed some light.

05:35.366 --> 05:36.766
Yeah.

05:36.767 --> 05:38.768
Charlie.

05:38.769 --> 05:40.870
The boy wonder. (Laughs)

05:40.871 --> 05:42.642
How long has it been, huh?

05:42.643 --> 05:43.973
It's been too long.

05:43.974 --> 05:45.645
Look at you in
your cushy office.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.046
Yeah, well, you know...

05:47.047 --> 05:48.948
You don't miss, uh,
mold and peeling paint?

05:48.949 --> 05:51.080
Well, I don't miss
being shot either.

05:51.081 --> 05:52.652
(Chuckles) Shoulda
ducked, partner.

05:52.653 --> 05:55.024
I told you that
banger was our man.

05:55.025 --> 05:56.487
(Chuckles)

05:58.529 --> 06:00.630
(People speaking indistinctly)

06:00.631 --> 06:02.361

06:02.362 --> 06:03.763
(Sets frame down)

06:03.764 --> 06:05.034
You like it here?

06:05.035 --> 06:06.966
You're stalling.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.668
(People continue

06:08.669 --> 06:12.142

06:19.810 --> 06:21.481
Megan, I don't believe
you know my old partner

06:21.482 --> 06:22.652
from the police force.

06:22.653 --> 06:23.983
This is Charlie meeks.

06:23.984 --> 06:26.617
Nice to meet you.

06:27.718 --> 06:30.720
I wish I could say the same.

06:30.721 --> 06:33.122
Charlie may know the victim.

06:33.123 --> 06:36.427
We already have an I.D.
His name is Johnny vasquez.

06:38.429 --> 06:41.431
Johnny vasquez
was his cover name.

06:41.432 --> 06:43.733
His real name is Eddie castillo.

06:43.734 --> 06:44.935
He was my partner.

06:46.637 --> 06:48.879
He's a cop.

06:54.545 --> 06:55.845
(Fabric snaps)

06:55.846 --> 06:58.489
♪♪♪

07:01.922 --> 07:03.723
Okay, listen up.

07:03.724 --> 07:07.196
Eddie castillo was my partner.

07:07.197 --> 07:09.559
No one's going home,
no texting your mother,

07:09.560 --> 07:12.201
until we find
whoever killed Eddie.

07:12.202 --> 07:14.163
Medical examiner's
office informs us

07:14.164 --> 07:16.836
we're looking for somebody
with dark brown hair,

07:16.837 --> 07:19.609
probably near the docklands.

07:19.610 --> 07:22.842
Anything you need to
nail this guy, you got it.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.714
Captain says so.

07:24.715 --> 07:25.815
So come on. (Claps hands)

07:25.816 --> 07:27.747
Let's go. We're
bringing this guy down!

07:27.748 --> 07:28.918
Come on! (Indistinct
conversations)

07:28.919 --> 07:31.721
Your troops seem a
little hopped up out there.

07:31.722 --> 07:33.923
Eddie was a good
man, a good cop.

07:33.924 --> 07:35.925
I think what she's trying to
say is, emotions are high.

07:35.926 --> 07:39.188
You may want to remind
your men to follow procedure.

07:39.189 --> 07:40.690
We know how to do our job.

07:40.691 --> 07:42.061
How can I help you do yours?

07:42.062 --> 07:44.063
Answer some questions.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.065
I assume, as part of his cover,

07:46.066 --> 07:48.137
that detective castillo
had to take drugs?

07:48.138 --> 07:51.100
Because we found
several in his system.

07:51.101 --> 07:53.643
He would do anything
to maintain his cover.

07:53.644 --> 07:56.646
He even did a stint in prison
to build up his street cred.

07:56.647 --> 07:58.177
What was Eddie investigating?

07:58.178 --> 08:00.550
Someone was
extorting the docklands.

08:00.551 --> 08:02.211
They're using
low-level drug dealers

08:02.212 --> 08:05.214
to shake down bars, restaurants,
even high-level dealers.

08:05.215 --> 08:07.557
Eddie set himself up as a Mark.

08:07.558 --> 08:09.689
Apparently, a little too well.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.661
Ballistics is still
working on the bullet.

08:11.662 --> 08:13.593
It goes without saying,
this is our top priority.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.825
Anything new on our end,
and you'll be the first to know.

08:15.826 --> 08:16.866
Thank you.

08:16.867 --> 08:18.528
(Sam) So you get
anywhere with that number?

08:18.529 --> 08:19.669
It's just an answering machine,

08:19.670 --> 08:21.130
but it does belong
to a ray Jones,

08:21.131 --> 08:22.872
music producer.

08:22.873 --> 08:24.834
Mm. So our poor torch
singer did have a fan.

08:24.835 --> 08:25.835
Maybe.

08:25.836 --> 08:27.537
(Cell phone rings) Ah.

08:27.538 --> 08:29.709
(Sam speaking indistinctly)
Lopez, that better not be my o.J.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.011
You got 4 gallons in there.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.784
It is for the wife. Put it away.

08:34.785 --> 08:35.845
(Sam continues
speaking indistinctly)

08:35.846 --> 08:36.846
Put it away.

08:36.847 --> 08:39.188
Jeez Louise. Greedy. Thank you.

08:39.189 --> 08:40.850
(Beeps)

08:40.851 --> 08:42.151
(Chuckles)

08:42.152 --> 08:44.994
A unit responded to a call
from the wonderland bar.

08:44.995 --> 08:49.629
Seems like our torch singer
just tried to Rob the place.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.631
So, Kirsten, where
were you going?

08:51.632 --> 08:54.604
Officers said you had
your bags packed in the car,

08:54.605 --> 08:56.035
tank full of gas.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.868
You're the ones who forced
me to dime out Johnny's contacts.

08:58.869 --> 09:00.970
You think I'm
gonna stick around?

09:00.971 --> 09:03.813
But first a quick stop
to Rob your employer.

09:03.814 --> 09:05.544
See,

09:05.545 --> 09:07.647
this is what we
call a telling act.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.779
You need money, you steal.

09:09.780 --> 09:11.250
You need drugs...

09:11.251 --> 09:13.322
You think I killed Johnny?

09:13.323 --> 09:16.325
Well, I can't say
it would shock us.

09:16.326 --> 09:18.728
J-J-Johnny said he had

09:18.729 --> 09:20.690
a friend in the music business

09:20.691 --> 09:22.732
who would listen to my demo.

09:22.733 --> 09:24.894
I didn't go in there to steal.

09:24.895 --> 09:26.796
I just...

09:26.797 --> 09:27.997
When I saw the money,

09:27.998 --> 09:30.741
I-I thought it would
help me get outta here.

09:31.842 --> 09:35.044
Start fresh, you know?

09:35.045 --> 09:38.649
I-I couldn't help myself.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.911
(Sam) Mm.

09:41.912 --> 09:44.714
I always knew this
day would come.

09:44.715 --> 09:47.116
(Megan) It must have
been very difficult,

09:47.117 --> 09:49.058
living with the constant stress.

09:49.059 --> 09:50.760
It was just the opposite.

09:50.761 --> 09:52.862
It was the most
liberating relationship

09:52.863 --> 09:54.664
I've ever been in.

09:54.665 --> 09:56.595
Nothing got swept under the rug.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.699
We both knew that every
day together could be our last.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.871
Did he ever talk about his work?

10:01.872 --> 10:04.003
The undercover stuff? No.

10:04.004 --> 10:06.736
Police gossip? I got an earful,

10:06.737 --> 10:09.909
especially about meeks.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.941
With all his womanizing
and drinking,

10:11.942 --> 10:14.684
I always thought he'd be
the one to walk into a bullet.

10:14.685 --> 10:17.747
(Indistinct conversations)

10:17.748 --> 10:19.118
Mrs. Castillo,

10:19.119 --> 10:21.050
we're trying to sort out
which of our findings

10:21.051 --> 10:22.892
are part of Eddie's cover

10:22.893 --> 10:24.654
and which weren't.

10:24.655 --> 10:26.195
Uh, we have some prison records

10:26.196 --> 10:28.858
that say that he broke
his wrist in a prison fight.

10:28.859 --> 10:29.830
Is that true?

10:29.831 --> 10:31.000
No.

10:31.001 --> 10:33.002
He broke it on our
first trip together,

10:33.003 --> 10:34.964
snowboarding in the poconos.

10:34.965 --> 10:36.836
The doctors put him in a cast,

10:36.837 --> 10:38.968
and he was back
out on the slopes...

10:38.969 --> 10:40.970
To be with me.

10:40.971 --> 10:43.843
We also found a white gold charm

10:43.844 --> 10:45.945
in one of Eddie's pockets

10:45.946 --> 10:47.777
with a number 3 on it.

10:47.778 --> 10:50.179

10:53.984 --> 10:55.284

10:55.285 --> 10:58.929
We were supposed to have
dinner, but he never showed.

11:00.731 --> 11:03.734
I think a part of me
knew at that moment.

11:05.996 --> 11:08.838
Can I have my
anniversary present?

11:08.839 --> 11:11.100
They're sending me to
a hotel for my protection.

11:11.101 --> 11:13.202
I don't know how long
I'm gonna be there for.

11:13.203 --> 11:15.945

like to have it.

11:15.946 --> 11:19.078
I'm very sorry. It's
still in police evidence.

11:19.079 --> 11:22.111

(Ethan) Okay. Check this out.

11:30.220 --> 11:33.022

fragment of foreign material

11:33.023 --> 11:34.323
in the knuckle laceration,

11:34.324 --> 11:36.996
and it's not biological.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.368
You know how your
case ends, right?

11:39.369 --> 11:41.200
Yeah, we catch a cop killer.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.201
Mnh-mnh.

11:44.374 --> 11:45.875

11:47.938 --> 11:49.408
This is a lose-lose situation.

11:49.409 --> 11:52.311
One tiny thing goes wrong,
and whose heads are gon' roll?

11:52.312 --> 11:54.043
Don't let anything go wrong.

11:54.044 --> 11:55.785
Hmm. What about
the hairs on the body?

11:55.786 --> 11:57.016
You got anything yet?

11:57.017 --> 12:00.019
Yeah, codis matched it to

12:00.020 --> 12:01.320
a Quentin whitsett,

12:01.321 --> 12:03.292
2-time felon.

12:03.293 --> 12:04.293
Okay.

12:04.294 --> 12:05.995
Here's a thought,

12:05.996 --> 12:08.858
next time you I.D. A cop killer,

12:08.859 --> 12:10.100
lead with that.

12:11.331 --> 12:14.303
Quentin whitsett.
That son of a bitch.

12:14.304 --> 12:16.465
I take it you know
the man. Yeah.

12:16.466 --> 12:18.407
What kind of history
you got with this guy?

12:18.408 --> 12:20.409
I busted him for
possession six months ago.

12:20.410 --> 12:22.441
He filed harassment charges.

12:22.442 --> 12:24.273
That's why I don't want
you anywhere near him.

12:24.274 --> 12:26.045
Captain...

12:26.046 --> 12:28.247
He executed my partner.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.821
There is no way I'm not going.

12:33.023 --> 12:34.353
Okay, as backup.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.085
S.w.a.t. Has tactical command.

12:36.086 --> 12:38.187
You take whoever you need,

12:38.188 --> 12:40.059
but you bring him in.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.191
I thought we'd
already I.D.'Ed whitsett.

12:42.192 --> 12:45.334
We did, but hair is
a nutritional timeline

12:45.335 --> 12:48.868
that shows relative health,
sickness, and drug use.

12:48.869 --> 12:49.939
So?

12:49.940 --> 12:51.901
Curtis, you still have
those records up?

12:51.902 --> 12:53.502
According to his parole records,

12:53.503 --> 12:54.944
whitsett wasn't doing drugs.

12:54.945 --> 12:57.006
As of the last one
three weeks ago,

12:57.007 --> 12:59.078
he tested negative 25 times.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.350
So how come his hair
sample tested positive

13:01.351 --> 13:03.052
for chronic drug use?

13:03.053 --> 13:04.453
Here's another
question for you...

13:04.454 --> 13:06.055
Does it strike anyone else
as odd that all three hairs

13:06.056 --> 13:08.918
are 1.5 inches in length?

13:08.919 --> 13:12.121
That's the sample
size the crime lab uses.

13:12.122 --> 13:14.563
I knew this case
was trouble. I told you.

13:14.564 --> 13:16.525
Wait a second. So
you're saying that...

13:16.526 --> 13:18.027
I'm saying that
they're whitsett's hairs,

13:18.028 --> 13:20.099
but they had to have
come from police evidence

13:20.100 --> 13:21.230
in a prior case.

13:21.231 --> 13:25.104
And the last time that
whitsett was busted was...

13:25.105 --> 13:27.106
Six months ago,
arresting officer...

13:27.107 --> 13:29.009
Charlie meeks.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.111
No way. You seriously think that

13:32.112 --> 13:34.984
Charlie is framing whitsett
for his partner's murder?

13:34.985 --> 13:36.215
I think someone is,

13:36.216 --> 13:38.217
and the police are about
to bust down whitsett's door.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.219
If one of them's behind
this, what do you think

13:40.220 --> 13:42.451
the chances are that
whitsett's gonna survive?

13:42.452 --> 13:43.822
(Gun clicks)

13:43.823 --> 13:45.325
(Click)

13:47.427 --> 13:49.399
All right. Let's go.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.871
They're about to
take him down now.

14:01.872 --> 14:03.112
Call it off. What?

14:03.113 --> 14:05.414
He's being framed. Call it off.

14:05.415 --> 14:06.415
What's going on?

14:06.416 --> 14:08.017
Peter says call of the bust.

14:08.018 --> 14:09.348
We can't call it off.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.180
They're about to take
the door right now.

14:11.181 --> 14:12.882
Whitsett's being
framed by a cop.

14:12.883 --> 14:15.324
Meeks.

14:15.325 --> 14:17.327

14:34.404 --> 14:36.245
Put the gun down! Put
the gun down right now!

14:36.246 --> 14:37.947
He killed my partner!

14:37.948 --> 14:39.108
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
(Officers shouting indistinctly)

14:39.109 --> 14:40.249

do anything! Shut up!

Come on, meeks.
Put it down, meeks.

away from this.

14:44.054 --> 14:45.214
Somebody get this guy
off of me! Stand down!

14:45.215 --> 14:47.016
No! This piece of
trash killed Eddie.

Shut up! Please

I appreciate that you're upset.

15:07.437 --> 15:08.477
Upset?

15:08.478 --> 15:10.009
We're lucky no one got shot.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.340
And where the

15:11.341 --> 15:13.382

tactical operation?

15:13.383 --> 15:15.344
Hi. My idea.

15:15.345 --> 15:17.016
Our evidence was compelling,
and as I understand it,

15:17.017 --> 15:19.448
your tactical
operation went to hell

15:19.449 --> 15:21.090
when meeks decided
to play cowboy.

15:21.091 --> 15:23.092
I put meeks on leave.

15:23.093 --> 15:24.493
But as for your
compelling evidence...

15:24.494 --> 15:27.396
Every hair 1.5 inches
automatically came from our lab?

15:27.397 --> 15:29.258
I don't think so.

15:29.259 --> 15:31.130
The hair tested
positive for cocaine.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.062
And yet your own parole reports

15:33.063 --> 15:35.134
have whitsett clean
as of three weeks ago.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.405
He could've gotten a
haircut six months ago,

15:36.406 --> 15:39.068
and the night of the murder,
put on the same hat or jacket.

15:39.069 --> 15:41.310
Whatever. (Mutters)

15:41.311 --> 15:43.412

(Megan) Mr. Whitsett, I would
not want to be you right now.

15:52.452 --> 15:54.323
The police think you
killed an undercover cop.

15:54.324 --> 15:56.525
Someone's setting me
up. I didn't kill anybody.

15:56.526 --> 15:59.058
Your hair was found on the body,

15:59.059 --> 16:00.429

positive for cocaine.

16:00.430 --> 16:03.062

16:04.594 --> 16:06.465
He feels the same way about you.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.138
He... he's trying to frame
me. I didn't kill no cop.

16:09.139 --> 16:10.469
Then give me a hair sample.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.990

18:32.682 --> 18:34.743
and I was scared for him.

18:34.744 --> 18:36.515
I mean, he was really

18:36.516 --> 18:39.788
burning the candle at both ends.

18:39.789 --> 18:41.620
Thought he was
taking too many risks

18:41.621 --> 18:42.891
getting in with these people,

18:42.892 --> 18:44.623
but he swore he
was on to something.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.124
And he wouldn't tell you what.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.596
Yeah, well...

18:47.597 --> 18:49.658
We were supposed to meet, but...

18:49.659 --> 18:51.430
He got shot in the head.

18:51.431 --> 18:54.132
Wait a second. Y... you
were in the area last night?

18:54.133 --> 18:56.635
I was waiting in my
car about 5 miles away.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.667
With no alibi for the shooting?

18:58.668 --> 19:00.509
♪♪♪

19:00.510 --> 19:03.612
Well, how about my word?

19:03.613 --> 19:06.815
Or does that not count
with you anymore?

19:06.816 --> 19:08.347
(Cell phone chirps)

19:08.348 --> 19:12.622
♪♪♪

19:21.531 --> 19:23.932
Ethan tied the gold
filling fragment to meeks.

19:23.933 --> 19:26.565
But since you already know that,

19:26.566 --> 19:28.897
I'm just wondering why I
didn't hear about it from you.

19:28.898 --> 19:30.569
I wanted to talk
to my partner first.

19:30.570 --> 19:31.640
I'm your partner.

19:31.641 --> 19:33.572
He's your ex-partner.

19:33.573 --> 19:36.445
And his partner is lying
in a refrigerated drawer.

19:36.446 --> 19:37.606
Charlie didn't kill him. Why?

19:37.607 --> 19:38.807
Because he says so?

19:38.808 --> 19:40.349
I spent six years putting
my life in his hands

19:40.350 --> 19:41.650
on a daily basis,

19:41.651 --> 19:43.612
so, yeah, because he says so.

19:43.613 --> 19:45.684
I know he didn't do it,
Megan. No, you don't.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.787
Get your emotions out of this.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.590
If you go after meeks, I
can't be with you on this one.

19:51.591 --> 19:52.821
Okay? I'm sorry.

19:52.822 --> 19:54.463
It's not about
divided loyalties.

19:54.464 --> 19:55.464
You work for me.

19:55.465 --> 19:56.626
Not on this one.

20:07.977 --> 20:10.980
(Indistinct conversations)

20:13.643 --> 20:15.784
(Conversations stop)

20:15.785 --> 20:16.945
(Sighs)

20:16.946 --> 20:18.447
I've noticed you have a knack

20:18.448 --> 20:20.789
for rubbing people
the wrong way.

20:20.790 --> 20:22.551
And I've noticed that you

20:22.552 --> 20:26.725
have got something
wrong with your department.

20:26.726 --> 20:30.259
The gun is a match.
I will give you that.

20:30.260 --> 20:32.261
But don't you think it's
odd that the only evidence

20:32.262 --> 20:34.303
that wasn't planted
on Eddie's body

20:34.304 --> 20:35.934
was the gold filling
from his knuckle,

20:35.935 --> 20:37.306
and that belongs to meeks?

20:37.307 --> 20:38.807
So now meeks
planted the gun, too?

20:38.808 --> 20:40.339
You said it yourself,

20:40.340 --> 20:41.670
someone's extorting
the docklands,

20:41.671 --> 20:43.772
somebody that you
can't I.D. Or get close to.

20:43.773 --> 20:45.774
And you think it's meeks?

20:45.775 --> 20:47.516
Well, I've know the
man for 15 years.

20:47.517 --> 20:48.677
And he's many things,

20:48.678 --> 20:50.379
but a dirty cop
isn't one of 'em.

20:50.380 --> 20:51.480
Okay, fine. Let
me prove his story.

20:51.481 --> 20:52.851
Let me examine
the murder weapon.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.383
Well, you were copied
on the crime lab report,

20:54.384 --> 20:55.454
weren't you?

20:55.455 --> 20:56.555
(Chuckles) Oh.

20:56.556 --> 20:58.557
I am asking you to take the
tiniest leap of imagination,

20:58.558 --> 21:00.559
and all you want to
do is pin it on whitsett.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.491
Hmm. I'm beginning
to wonder why.

21:02.492 --> 21:04.493
Well, I'm beginning to
wonder what that guy said

21:04.494 --> 21:06.595
when you were running
your fingers through his hair

21:06.596 --> 21:08.367
that's making you want to
stick your neck out for him.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.938
I didn't say he was a good guy.

21:09.939 --> 21:11.570
I just said that you
do not have enough.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.372
Well, I don't agree,
and neither does the d.A.

21:13.373 --> 21:16.345
Whitsett's being
arraigned as we speak.

21:16.346 --> 21:20.449
(Indistinct conversations)

21:20.450 --> 21:22.051
Fine.

21:23.613 --> 21:25.954
Then I am recommending
mandatory drug tests

21:25.955 --> 21:27.456
for the entire department.

21:27.457 --> 21:28.717
What drug test?

21:28.718 --> 21:30.419
This is a drug-related case.

21:30.420 --> 21:32.290
An undercover officer posing
as a drug dealer was murdered.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.723
Police evidence
from a prior drug bust

21:34.724 --> 21:36.795
was planted to frame a suspect.

21:36.796 --> 21:40.499
So everyone of your
people agrees to be tested

21:40.500 --> 21:42.571
or internal affairs
will make them.

21:42.572 --> 21:44.334
Hmm.

21:54.614 --> 21:57.015
(Clears throat)

21:57.016 --> 21:59.017
Please tell me you
did not just threaten

21:59.018 --> 22:02.421
an entire homicide squad
with mandatory drug testing.

22:02.422 --> 22:03.492
They wouldn't let me
see the murder weapon.

22:03.493 --> 22:04.653
You just alienated

22:04.654 --> 22:05.954
the only people who
could make that happen.

22:05.955 --> 22:07.526
Come on.

22:07.527 --> 22:08.527
You don't think internal
affairs will take our side?

22:08.528 --> 22:10.058
We don't have a side.

22:10.059 --> 22:12.731
If you have to have
the gun, you send Peter.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.433
I'm sure his standing over there

22:14.434 --> 22:15.734
is a lot better than
yours at the moment.

22:15.735 --> 22:18.367
Peter and I are not...

22:18.368 --> 22:21.440
Quite seeing
eye-to-eye on this one.

22:21.441 --> 22:24.342
Peter.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.644
Do I understand correctly,

22:25.645 --> 22:27.446
you're refusing
to work this case?

22:27.447 --> 22:28.747
Would you do an
autopsy on a friend?

22:28.748 --> 22:30.419
I'd prefer not to.

22:30.420 --> 22:32.451
Well, that's what you're
asking me to do to meeks.

22:32.452 --> 22:34.423
And if there were evidence
proving that he was innocent,

22:34.424 --> 22:35.454
would you go after
it? (Elevator bell dings)

22:35.455 --> 22:36.525
Of course.

22:36.526 --> 22:37.756
Good. Then go get
the murder weapon

22:37.757 --> 22:39.027
from the police
so we can test it.

22:39.028 --> 22:40.529
Test it to prove
what... (Clicks button)

22:40.530 --> 22:42.030
That meeks planted it?

22:42.031 --> 22:43.932
Peter, I'm not asking.

22:43.933 --> 22:45.994
You're either on our
team or you're not.

22:45.995 --> 22:47.496
And frankly, I'm okay with
whichever choice you make,

22:47.497 --> 22:49.569
but you're gonna make it, now.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.444
(Knock on door)

22:55.445 --> 22:57.946
(People speaking indistinctly)

22:57.947 --> 22:59.848
Dr. Megan hunt,

22:59.849 --> 23:01.850
this is my wife...
Jeannie Morris.

23:01.851 --> 23:03.852
I have heard so much about you.

23:03.853 --> 23:05.454
Oh, really?

23:05.455 --> 23:06.455
Don't worry. I've known
buddy long enough to know

23:06.456 --> 23:07.586
who he likes and who he doesn't,

23:07.587 --> 23:09.588
even though he
complains about both.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.389
I'm standing right here. Well,
it is very nice tofinallymeet you.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.561
(Chuckles) Please. Sit.

23:12.562 --> 23:13.862
There's more?

23:13.863 --> 23:15.063
Oh, relax.

23:15.064 --> 23:17.566
We'll talk about you
another time, bud.

23:17.567 --> 23:20.669
Jeannie, if it's
all right with you,

23:20.670 --> 23:22.471
I would like to
give you a spot test

23:22.472 --> 23:23.772
for your blood sugar level.

23:23.773 --> 23:26.505
Uh, sure. Why?

23:26.506 --> 23:28.937
Well, bud has mentioned
some of the difficulties

23:28.938 --> 23:31.480
that you've been having,

23:31.481 --> 23:33.442
and I'm sure you're
being monitored

23:33.443 --> 23:34.813
by your own doctor.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.515
(Clicks)

23:36.516 --> 23:37.487
But...

23:37.488 --> 23:38.787
(Whirs)

23:38.788 --> 23:41.419
Have you been tested for
gestational diabetes yet?

23:41.420 --> 23:43.522
Um, it's scheduled
for my next visit.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.023
Put pressure on that.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.525
Well, I didn't want to alarm bud

23:46.526 --> 23:48.957
or you unnecessarily...

23:48.958 --> 23:49.958
(Beep)

23:49.959 --> 23:51.460
But your level is high.

23:51.461 --> 23:55.605
So... you need to make
that next visit tomorrow.

23:58.608 --> 24:00.739
(People speaking indistinctly)

24:00.740 --> 24:03.743
(Indistinct conversations)

24:06.716 --> 24:08.617
Review this later.

24:08.618 --> 24:09.918
(Clears throat)

24:09.919 --> 24:11.980
Peter dunlop.

24:11.981 --> 24:13.982
A fool's errand is beneath you.

24:13.983 --> 24:16.625
And not cooperating
is beneath you, sir.

24:16.626 --> 24:18.627
Yeah. You know what I think?

24:18.628 --> 24:20.629
I think you shouldn't
have left the force.

24:20.630 --> 24:21.790
You ever think
about coming back,

24:21.791 --> 24:22.991
I can make that happen.

24:22.992 --> 24:24.092
No, thanks.

24:24.093 --> 24:25.233
(Chuckles)

24:25.234 --> 24:26.595
She must be something special,

24:26.596 --> 24:29.237
this Dr. Hunt.

24:29.238 --> 24:31.099
What do you mean?

24:31.100 --> 24:33.101
Well, you can't be
there for the work.

24:33.102 --> 24:35.604
Staring at dead
bodies all day isn't you.

24:35.605 --> 24:37.946
Staring at her on
the other hand...

24:37.947 --> 24:40.078
Now that I can understand.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.911
What is it that you really
want to ask me, captain?

24:42.912 --> 24:46.184
You want his gun?

24:46.185 --> 24:48.718
Tell me about Megan hunt.

24:50.690 --> 24:51.861
(Knocks)

24:52.992 --> 24:55.193
As requested.

24:55.194 --> 24:57.626
Thank you.

24:57.627 --> 24:59.027
And you didn't
have to send Kate.

24:59.028 --> 25:00.198
I didn't.

25:00.199 --> 25:02.070
But now that I know,

25:02.071 --> 25:06.575
I... wish you'd changed
your mind yourself.

25:06.576 --> 25:08.737
You want to know who Charlie is?

25:08.738 --> 25:10.539
Sure.

25:10.540 --> 25:13.882
We were investigating
a gang murder.

25:13.883 --> 25:15.714
We went to interview
the suspect's wife,

25:15.715 --> 25:17.646
and the kids are
out the front crying,

25:17.647 --> 25:18.947
and I say to her,

25:18.948 --> 25:20.949
"when was the last time
you saw your husband?"

25:20.950 --> 25:22.591
And then from the
garage comes this guy

25:22.592 --> 25:24.593
with a 9-millimeter glock.

25:24.594 --> 25:27.656
And I take one in the
shoulder, but Charlie, he just...

25:27.657 --> 25:29.828
He stands there, toe-to-toe,

25:29.829 --> 25:32.161
and he takes this guy out.

25:34.233 --> 25:37.206
I have not changed
my mind about anything.

25:38.307 --> 25:40.809
(Footsteps receding)

25:40.810 --> 25:42.841
(People speaking indistinctly)

25:42.842 --> 25:45.014
(Sighs)

25:46.676 --> 25:49.248
Fire in the hole!

25:50.780 --> 25:54.683
Ow!

25:54.684 --> 25:57.025
(Ethan) Dr. Hunt, are you
okay? What happened?

25:57.026 --> 25:58.627
The gun bit me.

25:58.628 --> 26:00.729
It's called beretta
bite. (Sighs)

26:00.730 --> 26:02.060
If you're not familiar
with how to handle it,

26:02.061 --> 26:03.161
the slide can give
you a nasty cut.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.332
(Click)

26:04.333 --> 26:07.035
That's good. Maybe
it bit our killer, too.

26:07.036 --> 26:09.668
The crime lab went over
this gun and found nothing.

26:09.669 --> 26:10.799
I didn't see anything
in that report

26:10.800 --> 26:12.570
about an ultrasonic
alcohol bath.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.173
Hey, and then maybe we could
get our neutron phase analyzers

26:15.174 --> 26:17.846
to create a 3-d hologram
of the actual event. I mean...

26:17.847 --> 26:20.008
Forgive him. Three
double espressos.

26:20.009 --> 26:21.209
Caffeine calms me.

26:21.210 --> 26:22.580
It's not working.

26:22.581 --> 26:24.753
(Kate) The ultrasound
would lift any residual

26:24.754 --> 26:26.214
biological material from
the weapon, including yours.

26:26.215 --> 26:27.716
(Lopez) Good evening, doctors.

26:27.717 --> 26:29.317
Sorry for the interruption,

26:29.318 --> 26:31.890
but here's a little gift
from the boys in blue.

26:31.891 --> 26:34.723
In the spirit of cooperation,
we pooled our urine samples.

26:34.724 --> 26:35.924
Oh, my god.

26:35.925 --> 26:37.265
Congratulations...

26:37.266 --> 26:39.127
Pissing off an entire
law enforcement agency.

26:39.128 --> 26:41.701
We'll let you get
back to work now.

26:48.007 --> 26:50.639
Think I'll let you
handle this one.

26:50.640 --> 26:53.382
Departments at war?
Somebody's going down.

27:01.390 --> 27:02.851
(Megan) How's Ethan doing?

27:02.852 --> 27:05.894
Well, he won't be welcome
back to the lab for a while.

27:05.895 --> 27:07.856
That bottle had a
whole witch's brew

27:07.857 --> 27:10.298
of caffeine, mood elevators,
and antidepressants,

27:10.299 --> 27:12.330
but no illegal drugs.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.632
There's nothing from
the alcohol bath either,

27:14.633 --> 27:17.736
except for my own
blood and epithelials.

27:17.737 --> 27:18.907
I was thinking about that.

27:18.908 --> 27:21.409
The lab report says the
gun was boxed at the scene.

27:21.410 --> 27:23.872
And ballistics would return
the gun to the same box

27:23.873 --> 27:25.914
to maintain chain of custody.

27:25.915 --> 27:26.915
So the box is...

27:26.916 --> 27:28.376
Is also evidence.

27:28.377 --> 27:30.118
Uh, relax, superwoman.

27:30.119 --> 27:32.050
I already beat you to it.

27:32.051 --> 27:33.952
Please tell me you found
something in that box.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.784
A minute piece of latex.

27:35.785 --> 27:39.027
Uh, it must have gotten
caught in the slide of the gun.

27:39.028 --> 27:41.259
We're running it
now for biologicals.

27:41.260 --> 27:44.893
This is pretty
damn good, Curtis.

27:44.894 --> 27:47.196
Who's your daddy?

27:52.842 --> 27:55.343
I... I don't get it.

27:55.344 --> 27:57.205
Did somebody bail me out?

27:57.206 --> 27:59.307
Unexpectedly, the
charges were dropped.

27:59.308 --> 28:01.850
So I'm free to go.

28:01.851 --> 28:03.251
Yeah.

28:03.252 --> 28:05.954
But there's something you
should know before you leave.

28:05.955 --> 28:08.456
Johnny wasn't who
you thought he was.

28:08.457 --> 28:11.019
His real name
was Eddie castillo.

28:11.020 --> 28:12.721
He was an undercover cop.

28:12.722 --> 28:14.022
(Indistinct conversations)

28:14.023 --> 28:15.794
A cop?

28:15.795 --> 28:17.295
I don't believe it.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.868
He was lying to
me the whole time.

28:19.869 --> 28:21.229
Not about everything.

28:21.230 --> 28:22.470
(Rustles paper)

28:22.471 --> 28:24.472
This is the number
you were looking for.

28:24.473 --> 28:26.935
Eddie had it on
him when he died.

28:26.936 --> 28:28.977
The name is ray Jones.

28:28.978 --> 28:31.940
He heard your demo
tape. He liked it.

28:31.941 --> 28:35.844
He's expecting your phone
call ifyou can get clean.

28:35.845 --> 28:38.086
These people
might be able to help.

28:38.087 --> 28:40.018
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

28:40.019 --> 28:42.091
Oh, my god. Seriously?

28:44.323 --> 28:46.354
Johnny...

28:46.355 --> 28:49.758
He should be here for this.

28:49.759 --> 28:51.930
I'll never get to
tell him thank you.

28:51.931 --> 28:53.431
Actually...

28:53.432 --> 28:55.804
Y-You can if you want to.

28:55.805 --> 28:57.907
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

28:59.268 --> 29:01.970
First a cop killer,
now a dirty cop?

29:01.971 --> 29:03.141
It's making me nervous.

29:03.142 --> 29:04.312
(Scoffs) Nervous?

29:04.313 --> 29:05.844
You know, trying
walking a urine sample

29:05.845 --> 29:07.145
the size of a big gulp
down to the toxicology lab,

29:07.146 --> 29:08.977
then we'll talk nervous.

29:08.978 --> 29:11.079
Anything on the piece
of latex from the gun?

29:11.080 --> 29:13.982
We found d.N.A., but it
was heavily degraded,

29:13.983 --> 29:15.854
and only a partial profile,

29:15.855 --> 29:17.485
so we can't match
it exactly to meeks.

29:17.486 --> 29:20.488
I thought that we find data
and then draw conclusions.

29:20.489 --> 29:23.291
(Mouth full) What he meant was,
there is no way to exclude meeks

29:23.292 --> 29:25.293
unless he does something
I'm not asking him to do.

29:25.294 --> 29:26.294
What is that?

29:26.295 --> 29:27.765
Give us a blood sample

29:27.766 --> 29:30.869
so we could run a
full, fresh d.N.A. Profile.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.941
Please.

29:32.942 --> 29:35.273
I don't understand
how this helps.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.175
Detective meeks,

29:37.176 --> 29:39.107
if you unraveled the
double helix ladder,

29:39.108 --> 29:41.109
it would stretch from
here to the moon and back

29:41.110 --> 29:42.480
over 300 times.

29:42.481 --> 29:45.814
However, the d.N.A. That
we found in the gun box

29:45.815 --> 29:49.057
has just a few rungs.

29:49.058 --> 29:50.889
We need the whole
ladder to find a match.

29:50.890 --> 29:53.361
(Chuckles) Well, are
those few rungs of d.N.A.

29:53.362 --> 29:55.063
You found in the box

29:55.064 --> 29:56.965
unique enough to
match only one person?

29:56.966 --> 29:58.066
(Sighs)

29:58.067 --> 29:59.928
That is a very astute question.

29:59.929 --> 30:02.000
And the short answer is, yes.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.571
(Chuckles)

30:03.572 --> 30:04.973
Peter.

30:04.974 --> 30:07.936
(People speaking indistinctly)

30:07.937 --> 30:11.009
Trust me.

30:11.010 --> 30:14.212
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

30:14.213 --> 30:16.214
Okay.

30:16.215 --> 30:18.847
Come on. Let's do it.

30:18.848 --> 30:22.421
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

30:25.394 --> 30:26.554
(Elevator bell dings)

30:26.555 --> 30:27.926
So let me get this straight.

30:27.927 --> 30:29.327
You trust him, but
you don't trust me?

30:29.328 --> 30:30.959
When that test
comes back negative,

30:30.960 --> 30:32.100
what are you gonna say?

30:32.101 --> 30:33.932
That I followed the
evidence where it led me,

30:33.933 --> 30:35.063
with no apology.

30:35.064 --> 30:36.234
Where's that gotten
you? Nowhere.

30:36.235 --> 30:37.405
All we're doing is
ruling people out.

30:37.406 --> 30:38.566
At least I'm still trying.

30:38.567 --> 30:40.068
Oh, okay, Megan,
maybe I deserve that,

30:40.069 --> 30:42.310
but it's a big city, and
whoever this guy is,

30:42.311 --> 30:46.074
we're not gonna get him
through a process of elimination.

30:46.075 --> 30:50.078
(Indistinct conversations)

30:50.079 --> 30:51.980
Bud.

30:51.981 --> 30:54.582
Thank you so much

30:54.583 --> 30:58.856
for the collective urine
sample from the precinct.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.129
Yours was particularly potent.

31:01.130 --> 31:02.630
I had nothing to do with that.

31:02.631 --> 31:05.063
I thought it was a sick
joke and I told 'em so.

31:05.064 --> 31:07.035
Right.

31:07.036 --> 31:09.898
I just came by to thank
you for talking to Jeannie.

31:09.899 --> 31:12.370
The doctor says she does
have gestational diabetes,

31:12.371 --> 31:14.542
and that it's
manageable with diet.

31:14.543 --> 31:17.175
Oh, she'll be fine. She
just needs a little t.L.C.

31:17.176 --> 31:19.007
Yeah, well...

31:19.008 --> 31:22.050
(Exhales) I owe you.

31:22.051 --> 31:24.913
There is something
you can do for me.

31:24.914 --> 31:29.017
(Indistinct conversations)

31:29.018 --> 31:30.558
You're not gonna like it.

31:30.559 --> 31:33.022
(Sighs)

31:41.100 --> 31:42.071
(Indistinct conversations)

31:42.072 --> 31:43.471
You wanted to see me?

31:43.472 --> 31:45.133
Close the door.

31:45.134 --> 31:47.176
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

31:50.679 --> 31:53.042
I just want to know
where your head is.

31:54.213 --> 31:56.184
I brought you the
gun like you asked.

31:56.185 --> 31:58.916
And?

31:58.917 --> 32:01.319
Sometimes I want
to strangle Megan.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.121
I know the feeling. Believe me.

32:03.122 --> 32:04.492
(Clears throat)

32:04.493 --> 32:07.555
But I have never once doubted
her commitment to this job.

32:07.556 --> 32:11.600
And I hope I never
doubt yours again.

32:17.366 --> 32:19.437
(Indistinct conversations)

32:19.438 --> 32:21.040
(Door closes)

32:23.973 --> 32:25.943
(Bell) Whitsett... i don't care
what the damn m.E. Says,

32:25.944 --> 32:27.115
you gotta...

32:27.116 --> 32:28.077
Yeah.

32:28.078 --> 32:29.417
Hey, speaking of.

32:29.418 --> 32:31.279
(Meeks) What's going on?

32:31.280 --> 32:33.281
Did the test come back?

32:33.282 --> 32:35.023
I'm cleared, right?

32:35.024 --> 32:36.084
Charlie meeks,
you're under arrest

32:36.085 --> 32:37.485
for the murder
of Eddie castillo.

32:37.486 --> 32:39.957
You have the right
to remain silent.

32:39.958 --> 32:42.530
Anything you say can and will be
used against you... (Handcuffs clicking)

32:42.531 --> 32:44.232
You set me up.
In a court of law.

32:44.233 --> 32:45.094
What the hell are you doing?
You have the right to an attorney.

32:45.095 --> 32:46.494
Lopez, back up.
He had no choice.

32:46.495 --> 32:48.196
If you cannot afford an
attorney... This is crazy.

32:48.197 --> 32:49.098
An attorney will be provided
for you. I didn't kill Eddie.

32:49.099 --> 32:50.738
He was my partner.

32:50.739 --> 32:52.440
Do you understand these
rights as I've presented it to you?

32:52.441 --> 32:54.243
I didn't do it!

32:59.248 --> 33:00.408
I don't need to tell
you the seriousness

33:00.409 --> 33:01.549
of the charges
that meeks is facing

33:01.550 --> 33:03.081
or the trouble it's gonna
be for this department.

33:03.082 --> 33:05.283
What I need from each
of you is a statement

33:05.284 --> 33:07.315
describing meeks'
involvement in this case.

33:07.316 --> 33:09.157
If you have no knowledge
of his involvement,

33:09.158 --> 33:11.489
I need you to write that
down and sign your name.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.261
If you were at the crime scene,

33:13.262 --> 33:15.163
if you were at the raid at
Quentin whitsett's house,

33:15.164 --> 33:16.524
or you engaged detective meeks

33:16.525 --> 33:18.526
in a conversation
about this case,

33:18.527 --> 33:20.298
then you need to write that down

33:20.299 --> 33:22.430
and sign your name.

33:22.431 --> 33:25.504
We'll do this one at a time
in the interrogation room.

33:36.345 --> 33:37.345
(Door closes)

33:37.346 --> 33:38.646
What the hell are you doing?

33:38.647 --> 33:40.488
You couldn't at least
give me a heads-up?

33:40.489 --> 33:42.190
It was your idea.

33:42.191 --> 33:44.492
My idea? What, to
arrest Charlie for murder?

33:44.493 --> 33:46.494
Peter. What?

33:46.495 --> 33:48.497
Trust me.

33:49.558 --> 33:50.559
Check out the monitor.

33:52.361 --> 33:54.562
They're signing
statements. So what?

33:54.563 --> 33:56.604
Process of elimination.

33:56.605 --> 33:58.666
We bust meeks to sell the idea
we need everyone's statements,

33:58.667 --> 34:01.709
then bring 'em in, make
'em sign before the camera.

34:01.710 --> 34:03.441
Well, what are you looking for?

34:03.442 --> 34:04.572
Beretta bite.

34:04.573 --> 34:06.274
And you were
right about Charlie.

34:06.275 --> 34:08.416
His d.N.A. Did not
match the fragment

34:08.417 --> 34:10.047
from the gun. (Sighs)

34:10.048 --> 34:12.321
But it's gotta belong
to somebody. (Sighs)

34:30.068 --> 34:32.540
Signed, sealed, delivered.

34:32.541 --> 34:35.544
I was just hoping it wasn't
gonna be from one of us.

34:37.746 --> 34:40.108
Uh, not so fast, detective.

34:40.109 --> 34:41.609
What? It's all there, captain.

34:41.610 --> 34:44.152
You left out the part
about killing Eddie castillo.

34:44.153 --> 34:46.214
It's you, you son of a
bitch. You're the dirty cop.

34:46.215 --> 34:47.285
You are a disgrace.

34:47.286 --> 34:48.686
Captain, come on. This is crazy.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.688
You thought you
were being so careful

34:50.689 --> 34:52.160
by wearing rubber gloves,

34:52.161 --> 34:54.792
but when you planted
whitsett's hairs on Eddie's neck,

34:54.793 --> 34:56.794
you left a trace of cornstarch.

34:56.795 --> 34:58.626
And you failed to familiarize
yourself with the gun

34:58.627 --> 35:00.628
before you shot him in the head.

35:00.629 --> 35:01.829
That's how you got
the Mark on your hand.

35:01.830 --> 35:03.571
I pinched it in a door.

35:03.572 --> 35:05.133
I don't think so.

35:05.134 --> 35:06.774
We have a d.N.A. Fragment on
the gun box. (Handcuffs clicking)

35:06.775 --> 35:08.176
A fragment?

35:08.177 --> 35:11.139
You can always give us
a full sample if you like.

35:11.140 --> 35:12.411
(Handcuffs jangle)

35:13.882 --> 35:15.413
I don't think so.

35:15.414 --> 35:17.145
(Sam) You know
what really bugs me?

35:17.146 --> 35:19.247
Guys who don't clean up after
themselves in the break room,

35:19.248 --> 35:21.649
leaving unwashed glasses
with their d.N.A. On it

35:21.650 --> 35:23.321
still lying around.

35:23.322 --> 35:26.195
I'll bet you you're sorry you
stole my wife's o.J. Now, right?

35:27.326 --> 35:29.527
(People speaking indistinctly)

35:29.528 --> 35:30.658
Get him outta here.

35:30.659 --> 35:34.332
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

35:34.333 --> 35:36.334
(Man) Lopez, man,
what's going on?

35:36.335 --> 35:39.338
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

35:44.543 --> 35:45.673
(Door opens)

35:45.674 --> 35:47.715
(Morris) Hey,
Jeannie. (Door closes)

35:47.716 --> 35:49.348
(Exhales deeply)

35:55.754 --> 35:57.486
(Sniffles)

36:05.494 --> 36:07.335
So this is dinner?

36:07.336 --> 36:08.666
(Sighs and sniffles)

36:08.667 --> 36:09.638
(Whimpers)

36:09.639 --> 36:11.369
Oh, no, no, no,
no. Don't... don't...

36:11.370 --> 36:12.900
Don't cry.

36:12.901 --> 36:15.343
No, i-i...

36:15.344 --> 36:17.505
I love beans.

36:17.506 --> 36:18.946
I just love 'em.

36:18.947 --> 36:21.579
Don't worry about it.

36:21.580 --> 36:23.751
First the genetic counselors
scare you to death

36:23.752 --> 36:25.753
with all the things that
could go wrong with the baby,

36:25.754 --> 36:28.556
and now there's
something wrong with me.

36:28.557 --> 36:30.418
I am stressed out.

36:30.419 --> 36:32.660
I'm practically useless at work.

36:32.661 --> 36:34.362
(Voice breaking)
And now I get to spend

36:34.363 --> 36:36.264
the next four
months praying to god

36:36.265 --> 36:37.665
I don't deliver prematurely.

36:37.666 --> 36:41.198
This is supposed to be,
like, this fresh start for us,

36:41.199 --> 36:42.530
and instead, it's...

36:42.531 --> 36:43.831
It's nine horrifying
months of dodging bullets,

36:43.832 --> 36:45.873
and I don't want to
put this on you, but...

36:45.874 --> 36:48.407
But you're going to, so...

36:51.640 --> 36:54.642
Every day you walk
out of that door...

36:54.643 --> 36:56.644
I am waiting

36:56.645 --> 36:58.486
for the same phone call

36:58.487 --> 37:01.419
that Eddie castillo's wife got.

37:01.420 --> 37:03.792
(Sniffles and exhales)

37:12.801 --> 37:14.001
(Whispering) Shh.

37:14.002 --> 37:15.503
(Sniffles)

37:15.504 --> 37:19.707
Shh.

37:19.708 --> 37:22.770
(Exhales deeply)

37:22.771 --> 37:24.473
(Door opens)

37:37.526 --> 37:38.986
Sometimes, you know, I wondered,

37:38.987 --> 37:41.529
how well I knew the
real Eddie when...

37:41.530 --> 37:43.631
He was so good at
pretending to be someone else.

37:43.632 --> 37:45.963
But then I'd catch a look,

37:45.964 --> 37:49.567
see him smile, watch
him sleep, and...

37:49.568 --> 37:52.500
And I'd feel his essence, but...

37:52.501 --> 37:55.403
I don't feel anything now.

37:55.404 --> 37:57.846
He really is dead.

38:01.710 --> 38:03.951
There is a poet named...

38:03.952 --> 38:05.683
Thomas Campbell

38:05.684 --> 38:07.516
who said...

38:09.287 --> 38:12.590
"To live in hearts
we leave behind

38:12.591 --> 38:14.763
is not to die."

38:17.826 --> 38:20.769
