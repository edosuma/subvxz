all agree,

01:16.588 --> 01:18.547

stereotypes out there

01:18.547 --> 01:20.338

a crowd favorite--

of the male persuasion.

10:35.172 --> 10:37.630

bachelorette?

10:37.630 --> 10:39.130
I was made for this.

10:39.130 --> 10:40.755
- I'm guessing this means
you're gonna be borrowing

10:40.755 --> 10:42.380
more of my ibuprofen tomorrow?

10:42.380 --> 10:44.255
- Hey Gary,
thanks for eavesdropping.

10:44.255 --> 10:45.713
You know what's super weird?

10:45.713 --> 10:47.630
No one ever asked to borrow
your penis.

10:47.630 --> 10:50.547

a penis, Gena.

11:12.838 --> 11:16.338
that was an awkward position
you put me in earlier today.

11:16.338 --> 11:17.963
- (Exhales)

11:17.963 --> 11:19.713
Is that my suitcase?

11:19.713 --> 11:22.838

scarves in my time here.

11:22.838 --> 11:26.005
- Okay, Mom, were you able
to contact the agency?

11:26.005 --> 11:30.588
Did you find a nanny or not?
- I used my own agency.

11:30.588 --> 11:33.588
I think Charlie needs
a sense of family.

11:33.588 --> 11:35.505
So I hired your sister.

11:35.505 --> 11:37.463

Eleanor: She has an artistic
sensibility

11:39.588 --> 11:41.588
that I think Charlie
very much needs.

11:41.588 --> 11:44.213
She's free spirited,
fluid, flexible.

11:44.213 --> 11:46.172
- Mom, she is the voice
of a cartoon,

11:46.172 --> 11:48.672
not Agnes Martin.
