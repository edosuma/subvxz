WEBVTT

00:03.580 --> 00:04.670
911 emergency.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.644
Oh, God. He's in the house.

00:06.679 --> 00:08.314
You've got to help me.
He's going to kill me.

00:08.349 --> 00:10.034
Okay, ma'am, now just calm down.

00:10.069 --> 00:10.870
Who is in the house?

00:10.905 --> 00:13.335
It's Dale Biederbeck.
Dale Biederbeck.

00:13.370 --> 00:15.676
Dale Biederbeck.

00:15.711 --> 00:16.805
Ma'am what is your address?

00:16.840 --> 00:19.831
It's 415 Vinton. For God's sakes, hurry.

00:19.866 --> 00:21.419
Okay, stay with me.

00:21.454 --> 00:22.720
Is he armed?

00:23.332 --> 00:24.521
Ma'am?

00:24.728 --> 00:26.919
Does he have a weapon?
Are you being threatened?

00:26.954 --> 00:29.513
He doesn't need a weapon,
he's Dale Biederbeck.

00:29.548 --> 00:32.348
All units, possible 556 in progress.

00:32.384 --> 00:34.042
Ma'am, can you get to a safe place?

00:34.077 --> 00:36.663
No, I'm upstairs. I'm trapped.

00:36.698 --> 00:38.561
Okay, ma'am, just stay by the phone.

00:38.596 --> 00:40.807
Here he comes. Oh, my God.!

00:41.021 --> 00:43.206
- No.! No.!
- Ma'am?

00:44.987 --> 00:46.305
Ma'am?

00:47.851 --> 00:49.301
Hello?

00:52.376 --> 00:58.557

01:45.500 --> 01:47.922
See, isn't this fun?

01:48.480 --> 01:54.080
Now, Adrian, this is what normal people
do on a Sunday morning. Get up.

01:54.115 --> 01:57.719
They hang out, relax, eat brunch.

01:57.987 --> 02:02.106
They don't stay at home vacuuming
their rug 40 times.

02:02.141 --> 02:03.983
Mom, we're not exactly normal.

02:04.018 --> 02:06.023
We are compared to some people.

02:06.058 --> 02:08.131
Okay, who do you want to be?

02:08.166 --> 02:10.544
Yellow, green, red or blue?

02:10.800 --> 02:14.267
Oh, boy. Okay, um...

02:16.932 --> 02:20.140
Okay. Oh, boy.

02:21.112 --> 02:25.169
Honey, remember we talked about how
Mr. Monk has trouble making decisions?

02:25.204 --> 02:27.885
Oh, yeah.
Okay, you'll be Colonel Mustard.

02:27.920 --> 02:30.230
- Good.
- Now, you remember how to play?

02:30.265 --> 02:32.157
You write down all the clues on your pad.

02:32.192 --> 02:33.678
I'm ready to guess.

02:34.202 --> 02:36.844
Adrian, you have to play the game.

02:36.879 --> 02:39.929
You have to go around the board
from room to room collecting clues.

02:39.964 --> 02:43.211
- I know who did it.
- We haven't started yet. Come on.

02:43.246 --> 02:46.107
It was Professor Plum
in the dining room with a rope.

02:49.547 --> 02:50.750
He's right.

02:50.785 --> 02:52.685
We played this game last year.

02:52.720 --> 02:56.167
I remember what cards everybody was
holding and how they were put away.

02:56.202 --> 02:57.263
And then, just now,

02:57.298 --> 02:59.278
- I was watching how Benjy shuffled...
- That's it.

02:59.313 --> 03:01.072
That-That is the last time

03:01.107 --> 03:05.064
I ever play a game with you, Adrian.
You are just no fun. - Okay.

03:05.099 --> 03:08.830
I mean, don't you ever wonder
why you never get invited anywhere?

03:09.003 --> 03:11.222
- No, not really.
- Well, this is why.

03:11.257 --> 03:13.607
- Okay.
- I think it's awesome.

03:13.642 --> 03:15.288
Mom, can I bring him to school, please?

03:15.323 --> 03:16.360
Like for show and tell?

03:16.395 --> 03:18.108
You can take him every day.

03:19.044 --> 03:20.336
Hello?

03:21.149 --> 03:23.633
Oh, hey, Captain.

03:24.041 --> 03:26.839
Yeah, he's right here. Stottlemeyer.

03:28.045 --> 03:31.774
Oh, well, actually, uh, we were
just finishing up a pretty big case.

03:31.809 --> 03:35.347
It was this nasty homicide, um,

03:35.382 --> 03:40.407
This woman was found murdered
in her dining room with a rope.

03:41.371 --> 03:44.395
Yeah. Hold on,
let me check our schedule.

03:44.430 --> 03:45.485
It's a job.

03:46.812 --> 03:47.903
Hey, Monk.

03:49.081 --> 03:52.671
Glad you're here. Miss Fleming.

03:53.117 --> 03:55.804
"Glad you're here?"
God, you must really be desperate.

03:55.839 --> 03:57.897
Usually the mayor's office has
to shove us down your throats.

03:57.932 --> 04:01.395
Fact is, the mayor's office did call,
but this time I did not argue.

04:01.430 --> 04:03.483
We have an unusual situation here.

04:03.518 --> 04:06.026
Yes? What do we have?

04:06.061 --> 04:09.278
Homicide with a baseball bat.
10:37 last night.

04:09.313 --> 04:11.030
You know the exact time of death?

04:11.065 --> 04:14.592
We know because she was
on the phone with 911 at the time.

04:14.627 --> 04:16.368
- Adrian. Wait, wait.
- What?

04:16.543 --> 04:19.629
Uh, Captain, before we get started,
could you just initial this agreement?

04:19.664 --> 04:23.005
- It's our standard consultation fee.
- It's what?

04:23.040 --> 04:25.043
Our standard consultation fee.

04:25.078 --> 04:26.631
Could we take care of that later, Sharona?

04:26.666 --> 04:28.267
Not now. - Adrian.

04:29.464 --> 04:31.258
I prefer to take care of business first.

04:31.293 --> 04:33.984
Bet that's not the first time
you've said that.

04:34.019 --> 04:35.153
Bite me.

04:35.188 --> 04:36.401
Give me that.

04:37.074 --> 04:41.354
Whoa, look at these prints.

04:41.606 --> 04:43.324
This was a big guy.

04:43.648 --> 04:46.149
Yes, he was a really big guy.

04:48.942 --> 04:51.371
Parked nearby, maybe around the corner.

04:51.406 --> 04:53.615
Walked through here and
went in through the side door.

04:53.650 --> 04:55.534
Yeah, and the lock's still intact.

04:55.569 --> 04:58.660
It wasn't jimmied.
She must have left it open.

04:58.695 --> 04:59.995
And what's all this?

05:00.030 --> 05:01.873
These are rocks from the garden.

05:01.908 --> 05:03.373
Killer left them like this.

05:03.408 --> 05:06.043
It's a message.
He's toying with us.

05:06.078 --> 05:07.296
Some sort of code,

05:07.331 --> 05:09.179
but I haven't been
able to figure it out yet.

05:09.214 --> 05:12.817
You think the killer stopped here
in plain view of the neighbors,

05:12.852 --> 05:15.471
went rooting around in the garden,
collected a few rocks...

05:15.506 --> 05:19.399
and then arranged them
carefully on the grass?

05:19.434 --> 05:20.777
What do you think?

05:20.975 --> 05:24.060
I think he was looking for a hide-a-key.

05:24.095 --> 05:25.022
I found it.

05:30.748 --> 05:35.464
Oh, man. Oh, God.
I don't feel so good.

05:35.499 --> 05:38.265
This is like a feng shui nightmare in here.

05:38.300 --> 05:41.712
Adrian, you gotta calm down.
You're rambling. Come on.

05:43.457 --> 05:44.706
Monk, Monk, Monk.

05:45.721 --> 05:48.426
Was there a fire?
L-I smell something.

05:48.461 --> 05:49.672
In the kitchen.

05:50.978 --> 05:52.757
Hey, hey, hey.
It's a crime scene.

05:52.792 --> 05:54.509
Okay. I know. I'm just...

05:54.544 --> 05:57.064
It's okay, I'll knock it all over again.
Don't worry.

05:57.099 --> 05:58.972
How many intruders?

06:01.433 --> 06:04.727
Are you guys gonna tell me
what's going on?

06:05.143 --> 06:06.862
Not yet.

06:12.110 --> 06:15.375
- Adrian, please.
- How many intruders?

06:15.410 --> 06:17.499
- Just one.
- One. Just one.

06:17.534 --> 06:19.294
- Just one...
- Monk, leave it.

06:19.504 --> 06:21.243
What's-What's with this?

06:21.278 --> 06:23.078
That's a smoke alarm.

06:23.113 --> 06:26.291
She was in the kitchen cooking something
when he broke in. It started to burn.

06:26.326 --> 06:30.097
A little girl across the street saw
the guy turning it off.

06:30.132 --> 06:31.671
So there was a witness?

06:31.706 --> 06:34.228
She's 10 years old.
She didn't see much.

06:34.263 --> 06:36.508
So the perp breaks in.
He goes berserk in here.

06:36.543 --> 06:39.303
The victim runs upstairs and calls 911.

06:39.725 --> 06:42.806
- It's strange.
- What's strange?

06:42.841 --> 06:44.216
The phone.

06:45.270 --> 06:47.893
He didn't take the phone off the hook.

06:47.928 --> 06:51.274
So, what, he just let her call 911?

07:17.342 --> 07:18.511
Any prints?

07:18.546 --> 07:20.511
Nope. Nothing so far.

07:22.863 --> 07:26.899
So... she's here cooking.

07:27.780 --> 07:32.107
He breaks in. He's a big guy.
Lot of noise.

07:32.142 --> 07:34.483
He must have cornered her in here,

07:34.518 --> 07:37.445
and then chased her out and
caught up with her in the bedroom?

07:37.480 --> 07:39.621
I would've grabbed a knife.

07:40.792 --> 07:43.911
- Why didn't she grab a knife?
- I don't know.

07:52.808 --> 07:56.505
She was over here on the phone.

07:56.674 --> 08:00.341
Severe blunt trauma to the head
with a baseball bat.

08:00.565 --> 08:04.473
- Has this phone been touched?
- No. No. The scene's intact.

08:16.526 --> 08:20.153
The antenna has to be up to
get a signal in here.

08:20.753 --> 08:22.155
So?

08:22.190 --> 08:26.536
Somebody lowered it all the way
after the call.

08:27.511 --> 08:28.957
You don't usually see that

08:28.992 --> 08:31.419
when someone's getting
bludgeoned to death.

08:33.096 --> 08:36.212
- Oh no, this can't be the victim.
- Yep.

08:36.248 --> 08:39.006
I recognize her.
Wasn't she a judge?

08:39.042 --> 08:41.341
Katherine Lavinio.
State Superior Court.

08:41.376 --> 08:43.227
We should check the court records.

08:43.261 --> 08:46.528
Somebody probably just lost a case
and held a grudge.

08:46.563 --> 08:49.650
We don't have to check anything,
because we know who did it.

08:49.685 --> 08:51.809
- What?
- The judge identified him...

08:51.844 --> 08:54.203
by name on the phone.

08:54.238 --> 08:55.899
Then why are we here?

08:57.107 --> 09:00.612
Because the man who
did it couldn't have done it.

09:02.447 --> 09:05.418
I'm sorry, Mr. Biederbeck,
that's out of the question. - Hold on.

09:05.453 --> 09:08.419
Now is it Danny or Daniel?

09:08.454 --> 09:09.799
Danny, sir.

09:09.834 --> 09:13.584
Fine, Danny. If you screw with me,

09:13.619 --> 09:16.767
I'll eat your heart on a stick.

09:16.802 --> 09:20.064
- Now the S. E. C...
- My boss is busy right now, sir.

09:20.099 --> 09:24.762
I know your boss is busy, Danny,
I'm watching him.

09:24.797 --> 09:28.846
Tell him Dale Biederbeck wants
an answer...

09:28.881 --> 09:30.849
- now, not later.
- Yes, sir.

09:30.884 --> 09:34.148
Now, is he in or out?

09:34.183 --> 09:40.274
If he's in, tell him
to... clean his glasses.

09:46.573 --> 09:52.163
Congratulate the congressman,
he's just been reelected to a fifth term.

09:53.288 --> 09:57.351
Oh, it's better than
the Home Shopping Network.

09:57.386 --> 10:00.588
Oh. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
I'm not finished!

10:00.623 --> 10:02.631
This stuff will kill you.

10:02.666 --> 10:04.775
I'm not gonna die.

10:04.810 --> 10:09.680
You won't let me, will you, Doctor?

10:11.099 --> 10:15.620
Ooh, ooh, ooh. Right on time.

10:16.272 --> 10:17.615
Dale Biederbeck?

10:17.650 --> 10:19.606
They call him Dale the Whale.

10:19.641 --> 10:21.108
I never heard of him.

10:21.143 --> 10:24.153
He spends a fortune every year
making sure nobody ever hears of him.

10:24.188 --> 10:27.413
He buys newspapers just to keep
his name out of them.

10:31.870 --> 10:35.889
All right. I want everybody
to be careful in there.

10:35.924 --> 10:38.267
This guy is smart.
He's gonna try to bait you.

10:38.302 --> 10:42.095
Assume you're being videotaped.
Do not accuse him of anything.

10:42.130 --> 10:45.841
Monk, I don't have to remind you
that this bastard's got deep pockets,

10:45.876 --> 10:49.345
and he's got a platoon of lawyers
and he loves to use them.

10:49.380 --> 10:51.026
You met him?

10:51.860 --> 10:53.359
What happened?

10:54.568 --> 10:57.560
Good afternoon.
I'm Christiaan Vezza.

10:57.595 --> 11:00.149
I am Mr. Biederbeck's
personal physician.

11:00.184 --> 11:01.357
I'm Captain Stottlemeyer,

11:01.392 --> 11:04.194
Lieutenant Disher, Adrian Monk
and Sharona Fleming.

11:04.229 --> 11:06.695
Sharona, enchante.

11:06.987 --> 11:09.364
Could you spell your last name
for me, Doctor?

11:09.399 --> 11:11.582
V-E-Z-Z-A.

11:11.759 --> 11:13.927
Mr. Biederbeck is expecting you.

11:13.962 --> 11:16.881
Really? Well, I didn't tell him
we were coming.

11:16.916 --> 11:19.415
Mr. Biederbeck is never surprised.

11:21.837 --> 11:25.975
Well, my, my, my,
it's the boys in blue.

11:26.010 --> 11:28.014
And the former boy in blue.

11:28.049 --> 11:30.260
Forgive me if I don't get up.

11:30.295 --> 11:32.971
Now, now, now.
Come on now, Bentley.

11:33.006 --> 11:35.686
I'm sorry. He hates cops.

11:35.902 --> 11:38.198
Mr. Biederbeck,
I am Captain Stottlemeyer.

11:38.233 --> 11:40.187
This is Lieutenant Disher and this is...
Adrian Monk.

11:40.222 --> 11:42.984
Oh, I know Adrian Monk.

11:43.019 --> 11:45.612
- How long has it been, my friend?
- Seven years.

11:45.647 --> 11:48.778
Seven years.
You look good.

11:48.813 --> 11:50.239
How do I look?

11:50.274 --> 11:52.800
You look great, Dale.
Hardly recognized you.

11:52.835 --> 11:56.163
Mr. Biederbeck has lost 104 pounds
since March.

11:56.198 --> 11:57.787
It's my own patented diet.

11:57.822 --> 11:59.206
High-protein juices and shakes.

11:59.241 --> 12:00.960
Of course, the hard part is
keeping it off.

12:00.995 --> 12:03.388
And this must be Sharona.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.511
The little nurse that saved his life.

12:05.546 --> 12:07.314
Come here, my dear.
Let me get a look at you.

12:07.349 --> 12:10.225
Come on. I won't bite.
Come closer.

12:13.362 --> 12:16.639
Tell me, are you still doing house calls?

12:16.674 --> 12:19.141
Um, I-I don't do that anymore.

12:19.176 --> 12:20.686
Oh, that's a shame.

12:20.721 --> 12:23.481
Call me if you change your mind.
You know, my night nurse just quit.

12:23.516 --> 12:26.192
Didn't give notice, can you imagine?

12:26.775 --> 12:28.163
Excuse me.

12:28.945 --> 12:30.988
Excuse me, putz?

12:31.023 --> 12:35.201
You're blocking the view.
It's really all I have.

12:35.953 --> 12:40.538
Mr. Biederbeck, we are investigating
the murder of Judge Katherine Lavinio.

12:40.573 --> 12:42.666
- I believe you knew her.
- Knew her very well.

12:42.701 --> 12:46.388
She was a political slug,
and I wasn't shy about saying so.

12:46.423 --> 12:50.227
Her antitrust ruling cost me $210 million,

12:50.262 --> 12:53.968
and this was back when
$210 million was a lot of money.

12:54.003 --> 12:57.681
Whoever killed her did the world a favor.

12:58.860 --> 13:00.101
Is this your bat?

13:00.136 --> 13:04.312
Captain, do I look like I play
a lot of baseball?

13:04.347 --> 13:06.567
Well, how do you explain your initials,
D. B., on the handle?

13:06.602 --> 13:09.283
Well, the question really is,
how do you explain it, Peewee?

13:09.318 --> 13:10.819
Maybe you put them there.

13:10.854 --> 13:12.406
Are you accusing us of tampering?

13:12.441 --> 13:15.448
Wouldn't dream of it.
But I could probably convince a jury of it.

13:15.483 --> 13:18.541
The first 20 numbers on
my speed-dial are all lawyers.

13:18.576 --> 13:20.288
Shall I call one?

13:20.497 --> 13:23.599
Adrian, by the way,
I was very sorry to hear about Trudy.

13:23.634 --> 13:25.754
I know she was your beloved,

13:25.789 --> 13:28.946
and I heard that during
our little difficulty,

13:28.947 --> 13:31.632
you never left her side, not even once.

13:33.467 --> 13:36.642
Where were you last night, about 10:30?

13:36.677 --> 13:38.806
Last night.

13:38.841 --> 13:41.476
Let me see, 10:30.

13:41.511 --> 13:45.491
Um, oh, yes. I was here.

13:45.526 --> 13:48.233
I haven't left this bed in 11 years.

13:48.268 --> 13:50.242
Even if I could,
I can't make it through the door.

13:50.277 --> 13:54.241
I'm five-and-a-half-feet wide
if you haven't noticed.

13:54.276 --> 13:58.173
More of me to love, Sharona.
I know what you're thinking.

13:58.208 --> 14:00.706
Is he really that big?
What's under those covers?

14:00.741 --> 14:05.625
I would confirm and swear under oath
that my patient weighs over 800 pounds.

14:05.660 --> 14:07.125
He's not faking anything.

14:07.160 --> 14:10.005
Excuse me, are you my lawyer?

14:10.306 --> 14:12.715
- Are you my lawyer?
- No, sir.

14:12.750 --> 14:15.260
Then shut up and stop defending me.

14:15.295 --> 14:17.596
Your job is very simple.
You keep me alive.

14:17.631 --> 14:18.984
Can you handle that?

14:19.019 --> 14:20.638
Yes. - Good.

14:21.473 --> 14:23.059
Where were we?

14:23.267 --> 14:25.302
Bread and butter.

14:27.438 --> 14:30.067
- What?
- Bread and butter.

14:30.102 --> 14:33.611
Those were Trudy's last words,
weren't they?

14:33.646 --> 14:37.238
The transcript of the coroner's inquest
is a matter of public record.

14:37.273 --> 14:41.493
The Internet, Monk,
it's the fat man's best friend.

14:41.528 --> 14:43.580
It's been troubling me for years.

14:43.615 --> 14:45.380
What could she have meant?

14:45.415 --> 14:47.915
Bread and butter.

14:48.793 --> 14:50.129
Go to hell.

14:50.802 --> 14:52.219
No doubt I will.

14:52.254 --> 14:54.839
I just hope it's handicapped accessible.

14:54.874 --> 14:59.096
No, no, no, no. Nunca me interrumpas.
Dije que no.!

14:59.131 --> 15:01.687
Afuera! Afuera!

15:02.223 --> 15:04.438
A trained monkey could do better.

15:04.473 --> 15:06.856
Mr. Biederbeck, this is not a joke.

15:06.891 --> 15:09.272
We have evidence, and
it's overwhelming. - Is it?

15:09.307 --> 15:11.524
Yes, it is. You have motive.

15:11.559 --> 15:14.626
You were identified
by name on the 911 call.

15:14.661 --> 15:17.948
A child in the neighborhood saw you
in the judge's house that night.

15:17.983 --> 15:21.797
Oh, my God, that sounds like
a strong case, Captain.

15:21.832 --> 15:23.707
What do you think, Monk?

15:23.910 --> 15:25.748
I think you killed her.

15:26.261 --> 15:28.122
Prove it.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.144
There's no way.

15:36.179 --> 15:38.255
Forty-five inches.
There's no way, Captain.

15:38.290 --> 15:40.049
The elevator's even smaller.

15:40.084 --> 15:40.928
What do you think?

15:40.963 --> 15:42.760
He did it. That's all I know.

15:42.795 --> 15:44.427
How about a crane through the window?

15:44.462 --> 15:46.264
A construction crane lowered
him to the street?

15:46.299 --> 15:48.684
Without anybody noticing?
It's impossible.

15:49.807 --> 15:52.310
Gentlemen. Sharona.

15:52.345 --> 15:54.037
Welcome to the freak house.

15:54.072 --> 15:56.858
Excuse me. Doctor, how long
have you worked for Biederbeck?

15:56.893 --> 16:01.277
I met him nine years ago while I was
writing an article on the morbidly obese.

16:01.312 --> 16:04.283
He funded my clinic and all my research.

16:04.318 --> 16:08.118
In exchange,
I am on call 24 hours a day.

16:08.153 --> 16:10.959
I sold my soul to the human wrecking ball.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.042
Will you excuse me?

16:13.334 --> 16:14.666
Helicopter. How about a helicopter?

16:14.701 --> 16:16.717
I thought you could use this.

16:17.352 --> 16:18.353
Thank you.

16:20.036 --> 16:23.906
- So you're a nurse?
- Mmm. I was.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.561
Where did you intern?

16:25.596 --> 16:27.818
Modesto General.

16:28.134 --> 16:29.942
So you knew Michelle Bletched?

16:29.977 --> 16:32.247
Oh, oh, my God, yes.

16:33.010 --> 16:35.083
"The Wretched Miss Bletched."

16:35.778 --> 16:37.187
Attention, everyone.

16:37.222 --> 16:39.974
Attention. This is not a drill.

16:40.394 --> 16:41.386
God.

16:41.876 --> 16:44.944
That-That is amazing.
You sound just like her.

16:44.979 --> 16:47.563
Yes, you should hear
my Katharine Hepburn.

16:47.598 --> 16:49.803
That's very good.
Very good.

16:50.360 --> 16:54.406
Well, uh, thank you.

16:54.441 --> 16:55.443
Thank you.

16:55.664 --> 16:58.935
I would, uh... I would love to buy you
a real drink sometime.

16:58.970 --> 17:00.542
When do you get off work?

17:00.799 --> 17:02.908
In December. No.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.207
Little joke.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.906
Excuse me, Doctor.

17:07.666 --> 17:11.439
Now, if Biederbeck is too big to
get out of the room,

17:11.473 --> 17:14.470
how'd he get there in the first place?
He's like a ship in a bottle.

17:14.505 --> 17:18.631
Well, when he first bought the apartment,
he weighed a mere 422 pounds.

17:18.665 --> 17:20.009
He could still walk.

17:20.044 --> 17:22.266
On a good day, he could see his toes.

17:22.300 --> 17:25.867
Then his mother died,
and he had a complete breakdown.

17:25.903 --> 17:27.430
He started bingeing.

17:27.464 --> 17:31.274
He would call restaurants and
order everything on the menu.

17:31.818 --> 17:35.221
He topped out at 927 pounds.

17:35.256 --> 17:37.043
That was a decade ago.

17:37.443 --> 17:39.851
He has not left the room since.

17:39.886 --> 17:43.079
Like I said, it's just not possible.

17:46.415 --> 17:47.688
Request denied.

17:47.723 --> 17:49.958
Your Honor, this is a very unusual case.

17:49.993 --> 17:52.146
- If you'll just let me explain the
details... - Denied, Lieutenant.

17:52.181 --> 17:54.074
How can I issue a search warrant?

17:54.109 --> 17:57.016
Your so-called primary suspect
can't possibly be guilty.

17:57.051 --> 17:59.751
He can't leave the room or
go down the elevator.

17:59.786 --> 18:01.565
- Adrian.
- It's all right, Miss Fleming.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.144
Mr. Monk is an old friend.

18:03.179 --> 18:04.314
Your Honor...

18:05.063 --> 18:08.508
Your Honor, Mr. Biederbeck may
not weigh as much as he claims.

18:08.543 --> 18:11.591
I have a deposition here from Dr. Vezza,
his personal physician.

18:11.626 --> 18:13.696
As well as two other physicians.

18:13.731 --> 18:15.725
Did Biederbeck ever threaten the victim?

18:15.760 --> 18:18.661
- No. Not exactly.
- He confess to the crime?

18:18.696 --> 18:20.725
He's too smart for that.

18:20.760 --> 18:22.568
But he did it, Judge.

18:22.752 --> 18:25.185
And he wants us to know he did it.

18:25.220 --> 18:26.861
He's rubbing our faces in it.

18:26.896 --> 18:30.130
Your Honor, he was identified
by name on a 911 tape.

18:30.165 --> 18:33.131
I don't like this any more than you do,
Lieutenant.

18:33.738 --> 18:36.062
Kate Lavinio was a friend of mine.

18:36.097 --> 18:39.355
We had dinner at Tuscany's
the night she was murdered.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.339
But the law is the law.

18:41.374 --> 18:44.605
You tell me how Biederbeck could have
possibly committed the crime,

18:44.640 --> 18:47.649
and I will serve this warrant personally.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.930
Uh-huh. Yes, sir.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.134
That was Captain. He said
it's okay to go ahead with Plan "B."

18:56.169 --> 18:57.606
What's Plan "B"?

18:57.641 --> 19:00.522
Sharona going undercover
as Biederbeck's nurse.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.526
- What?
- Thanks for consulting me.

19:02.561 --> 19:04.315
She still has her license, right?

19:04.350 --> 19:07.202
I mean, Biederbeck needs a nurse.
The other one just quit.

19:07.237 --> 19:10.003
No. Absolutely not.
I forbid it.

19:10.038 --> 19:13.825
- Sharona, she's not a police officer.
- Well, neither are you.

19:13.860 --> 19:15.972
- What?
- What, you don't think I can handle this?

19:16.007 --> 19:18.586
What are you talking... Forget this.

19:18.621 --> 19:21.007
I know Biederbeck, you
don't. He's dangerous.

19:21.042 --> 19:22.460
This man is capable of anything.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.322
He weighs 804 pounds.

19:24.357 --> 19:26.233
What is he gonna do, break wind on me?

19:26.268 --> 19:27.667
Let me explain the arrangement here.

19:27.702 --> 19:30.136
I'm the employer.
You work for me.

19:30.171 --> 19:33.626
I get to say what goes, and I say no.

19:45.471 --> 19:48.956
Yoo-hoo, Sharona?

19:48.991 --> 19:52.405
Come out, come out wherever you are.

19:52.440 --> 19:55.427
I know you can hear me.
Hello.

19:55.462 --> 19:55.897
Oh, my God.

19:55.932 --> 19:59.723
Florence Nightingale?
I need food.

19:59.758 --> 20:00.747
Crap.

20:03.037 --> 20:05.454
Oh, there you are.

20:05.489 --> 20:08.251
Didn't you hear the buzzer?
I'm starving.

20:08.286 --> 20:12.045
- I'm wasting away here.
- Sorry.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.214
Where were you?

20:13.249 --> 20:15.434
I was in the kitchen.
I couldn't find a tray.

20:15.469 --> 20:17.902
Liar, liar.

20:17.937 --> 20:20.990
Remember, there are no secrets
in the house of Biederbeck.

20:21.025 --> 20:22.641
You should know that.

20:22.676 --> 20:27.186
Hold on. You know,
Conroy is looking tired.

20:27.221 --> 20:29.622
Why don't you put in a left-hander.

20:42.549 --> 20:46.098
Oh. You know, most of
my other nurses sit on the chair.

20:46.133 --> 20:49.431
You must be attracted to me.

20:54.431 --> 20:57.135
Look, I-I'm just trying to do my job.
Okay?

20:57.170 --> 21:00.638
So, did you find what you were looking for?

21:00.673 --> 21:01.553
What do you mean?

21:01.588 --> 21:03.439
Don't be clever with me, Sharona.

21:03.474 --> 21:05.181
You're not up to it.

21:05.216 --> 21:08.501
I know that Monk sent you here
to spy on me.

21:08.646 --> 21:10.209
No, he didn't.

21:10.244 --> 21:12.085
You decided to come on your own.

21:12.120 --> 21:14.267
- Fantastic.
- That-That's not true.

21:14.302 --> 21:15.135
Of course it is.

21:15.170 --> 21:18.295
Hey, did he tell you
about his wife and me?

21:18.330 --> 21:20.825
- I know all about it.
- No, you don't.

21:20.860 --> 21:23.281
He didn't tell you.
He's too ashamed.

21:23.316 --> 21:27.614
See, nine years ago, his beloved
Trudy wrote a piece on me...

21:27.649 --> 21:32.086
in which she said I was
the Genghis Khan of world finance.

21:32.121 --> 21:35.730
So I sued her and the rag
that published the piece.

21:35.765 --> 21:37.442
Now, I knew I couldn't win,

21:37.477 --> 21:40.010
but I dragged things on long enough
that eventually

21:40.045 --> 21:43.688
Mr. And Mrs. Monk had to sell everything.

21:43.911 --> 21:46.667
Even that cute little starter house
they lived in.

21:46.702 --> 21:49.118
You know who owns it now?

21:49.153 --> 21:50.451
You. - Mm-hmm.

21:50.486 --> 21:54.296
I use it to store
my pornography collection.

21:54.331 --> 21:55.659
Which reminds me,

21:55.694 --> 21:58.590
are you interested in earning
a little extra money?

21:58.625 --> 22:00.678
Oh-Oh, come on, now.

22:00.713 --> 22:02.572
Don't be like that.

22:02.607 --> 22:03.860
I mean, after all, Sharona,

22:03.895 --> 22:07.265
I know how you paid your rent back
in Miami.

22:16.170 --> 22:17.852
What kind of dog is that?

22:20.447 --> 22:24.885
Sweetheart,
if you want to feel my stomach,

22:24.920 --> 22:27.472
all you have to do is ask.

22:27.755 --> 22:29.749
No, I wasn't trying...

22:29.784 --> 22:31.607
Of course you were.

22:31.642 --> 22:34.693
You were thinking, "My God,

22:34.728 --> 22:40.202
can he really be that
big, or is it a trick?"

22:40.466 --> 22:43.379
Let's find out, shall we?

22:45.703 --> 22:50.065
Totally... ¢Ü Alfresco ¢Ü

22:54.437 --> 22:55.501
Oh, my God.

22:59.386 --> 23:01.968
Mom, are you okay?

23:02.188 --> 23:03.418
You've been in there all morning.

23:03.453 --> 23:04.753
Go away.!

23:05.359 --> 23:06.837
Mr. Monk is here.

23:06.872 --> 23:09.494
Tell him I hate my job and I quit.

23:09.681 --> 23:11.377
I've never seen her freak out like this.

23:11.412 --> 23:13.998
I told her not to go!

23:16.169 --> 23:18.239
In case you're wondering, yes,

23:18.274 --> 23:20.471
he really is that fat, okay?

23:20.506 --> 23:23.369
He's Orca!
He's horrific!

23:30.717 --> 23:32.931
He also had videotapes of the judge.

23:32.966 --> 23:34.611
What kind of tapes?

23:36.674 --> 23:38.987
Interviews she did for TV.

23:39.205 --> 23:41.012
He had about 10 of'em.

23:41.047 --> 23:41.928
Wait.

23:43.269 --> 23:44.309
Hello.

23:45.789 --> 23:48.660
Yeah, he's here.
It's for you.

23:57.557 --> 24:00.398
- Hello.
- Bread and butter.

24:01.360 --> 24:04.476
Bread and butter.
It's been driving me crazy.

24:04.511 --> 24:06.716
What could she possibly have meant?

24:06.751 --> 24:08.808
Bread and butter.

24:08.952 --> 24:10.879
I figure it was a message.

24:10.914 --> 24:14.283
A secret message just for you.

24:15.964 --> 24:17.295
What can I do for you, Dale?

24:17.330 --> 24:19.699
Well, I'm a little worried about Sharona.

24:19.734 --> 24:22.255
She sort of fell apart on us last night.

24:22.290 --> 24:25.492
I'm really not sure
if we can count on her, Adrian.

24:25.527 --> 24:27.676
You have other things to worry about.

24:27.838 --> 24:29.770
You can't scare me.

24:29.805 --> 24:32.162
Don't even try.
You're meek.

24:32.197 --> 24:34.133
Meeky, meek, meek.

24:34.168 --> 24:36.647
Ooh, ooh. Gotta go.

24:36.682 --> 24:39.459
The Munich markets are closing.
Toodle-loo.

24:43.221 --> 24:46.850
I'm sorry... I'm sorry
I'm eating my lunch, but,

24:46.885 --> 24:48.929
you know, I only take 20 minutes for lunch.

24:48.964 --> 24:51.771
No, no, no, no.
I appreciate you squeezing me in.

24:51.806 --> 24:54.536
Okay. So, uh,

24:55.772 --> 24:59.951
we were talking about Dale the Whale.

25:00.147 --> 25:02.233
His name is, uh...

25:02.268 --> 25:03.355
His name is Biederbeck.

25:03.390 --> 25:05.498
Yeah, I know.
He owns my building.

25:05.533 --> 25:08.587
I'm not surprised.
He owns half the city with, uh,

25:08.622 --> 25:11.069
you know, with an option on the other half.

25:11.301 --> 25:17.283
Well, do you think he had like-like
a vendetta against Trudy?

25:17.318 --> 25:18.811
It was grueling.

25:18.846 --> 25:23.523
I would find her sitting in the car
in the driveway crying.

25:23.854 --> 25:26.316
It was the worst year of her life.

25:27.120 --> 25:30.827
She only had 34.
He stole one of them.

25:30.862 --> 25:36.138
So now he's a suspect
in this homicide case.

25:36.173 --> 25:39.805
- How does that make you feel?
- L-I-I hate the man.

25:40.381 --> 25:41.358
Is that wrong?

25:41.393 --> 25:43.901
No. No. I think it would be unusual if...

25:43.936 --> 25:46.408
you didn't... What,
is there something wrong?

25:49.514 --> 25:50.569
Uh...

26:08.441 --> 26:12.712
Yeah, um, tomato sauce on chin.

26:12.747 --> 26:15.362
Okay. Good.
Thank-Thank you, Adrian.

26:17.680 --> 26:18.802
What is that?

26:18.837 --> 26:21.838
That is a doggie bag.

26:21.873 --> 26:24.026
My wife and I went out
for dinner last night.

26:24.061 --> 26:26.155
And you couldn't finish?

26:27.162 --> 26:30.017
- You were full?
- Yeah. That's right.

26:31.513 --> 26:33.377
You were full.

26:33.412 --> 26:37.621
You-You brought the rest home
in a doggie bag.

26:37.891 --> 26:40.762
Am-Am I missing something here?

26:41.871 --> 26:45.147
Adrian, do you know
who asked me out? - Hmm?

26:45.182 --> 26:47.592
I'll give you a hint.
He's a doctor.

26:47.627 --> 26:48.914
Kervorkian?

26:48.949 --> 26:52.970
Very funny. Christiaan Vezza.

26:54.739 --> 26:57.078
I just love that name, Christiaan.

26:57.113 --> 26:59.236
You know who he's named after?

26:59.271 --> 27:03.634
Christiaan Barnard, who performed
the first human heart transplants.

27:03.669 --> 27:06.496
Yes, I know who Christiaan Barnard was.

27:17.332 --> 27:19.090
Help me out here.

27:19.125 --> 27:20.973
She lives alone.

27:21.008 --> 27:23.870
She's about to start cooking something.

27:23.905 --> 27:27.999
Stir-fried beef.
That's a meal, not a bedtime snack.

27:28.034 --> 27:29.176
So?

27:30.056 --> 27:31.342
Why?

27:33.103 --> 27:34.949
Maybe she was hungry.

27:34.984 --> 27:35.822
No.

27:36.146 --> 27:39.404
She went out to eat that night.
Remember?

27:41.753 --> 27:44.486
Doggie bags.
She couldn't finish her dinner,

27:44.521 --> 27:46.730
so why was she cooking?

27:46.967 --> 27:48.794
I have no idea.

27:50.560 --> 27:53.000
Maybe she wasn't.
Maybe after she was dead,

27:53.035 --> 27:55.621
the killer came back downstairs...

27:56.134 --> 27:58.471
to cook something himself.

27:58.506 --> 28:01.020
- Why?
- To make smoke.

28:01.249 --> 28:04.351
To set off the smoke alarm in there.

28:10.689 --> 28:11.880
My God.

28:11.915 --> 28:14.305
That's Dale Biederbeck's housekeeper.

28:15.594 --> 28:16.988
You worked for the judge.

28:17.023 --> 28:18.858
You cleaned her house?

28:18.893 --> 28:20.815
Then what happened?

28:20.850 --> 28:24.594
- The man, el gordo...
- Adrian, stop it.

28:24.629 --> 28:28.347
The fat man.
The big whale, he called me.

28:28.561 --> 28:30.487
He offered me more money.

28:30.522 --> 28:32.878
More than double to work for him.

28:32.913 --> 28:35.159
Adrian... - I know. I know.

28:35.388 --> 28:38.847
And then, the man... the fat man...

28:38.882 --> 28:42.383
He was always asking me
questions about the judge.

28:42.418 --> 28:45.495
When did she work?
Who were her friends?

28:45.530 --> 28:47.477
How late does she sleep?

28:47.710 --> 28:49.299
I tried not to answer.

28:49.334 --> 28:52.797
But he kept asking.

28:54.535 --> 28:59.156
Did he ask you how she locked her doors?

28:59.630 --> 29:01.221
Yeah.

29:02.189 --> 29:04.650
And you told him about the hide-a-key?

29:04.685 --> 29:07.045
The key in the rock?

29:07.919 --> 29:09.772
Oh, Senor Monk.

29:09.959 --> 29:13.510
Lo siento. Perdoname.!

29:14.417 --> 29:15.228
It's okay.

29:15.263 --> 29:17.558
- You know what, we gotta go now.
- Shh, shh, shh.

29:17.593 --> 29:20.489
- Don't-Don't... No, no.
- Thank you very much. Thank you.

29:20.524 --> 29:22.229
- It's all good.
- We're gonna go now.

29:22.264 --> 29:24.520
- We gotta go.
- We have to go.

29:24.950 --> 29:27.503
Sharona, just give me one more second.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.329
What time is it?

29:32.747 --> 29:34.363
No. Don't ask.

29:34.665 --> 29:39.033
Whew. Oh... Okay.

29:40.859 --> 29:42.628
Okay. Okay.

29:42.663 --> 29:45.125
Maybe we're looking at this all wrong.

29:46.174 --> 29:47.861
Maybe he killed her in his apartment,

29:47.896 --> 29:50.220
and then he somehow moved
the body back to her house.

29:50.255 --> 29:52.292
No. What about the 911 call?

29:52.327 --> 29:54.228
She made it from the house.

29:54.563 --> 29:55.439
Right.

29:58.681 --> 30:00.710
- What about liposuction?
- What?

30:00.745 --> 30:01.765
Liposuction. Yeah.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.990
He "lipoed"himself down to, like,

30:05.025 --> 30:07.200
I don't know, like, 400 pounds.

30:07.235 --> 30:10.751
Down the elevator, crossed town,
killed the judge.

30:10.786 --> 30:13.440
Well, how did he gain all the weight back?

30:15.043 --> 30:19.626
- Reverse liposuction.
- Oh, my God.

30:19.661 --> 30:22.462
Yeah. He just pumped it all back in.

30:23.950 --> 30:25.905
You think that's possible?

30:25.940 --> 30:28.702
I don't know. Should I call a doctor?

30:28.737 --> 30:34.417
No. Let's keep our reverse liposuction
theory to ourselves. Okay, Randy?

30:36.982 --> 30:40.631
Hi. Uh, which one of you is Sue Ellen?

30:40.802 --> 30:45.378
Hi. My name is Sharona,
and this is my friend Mr. Monk.

30:45.876 --> 30:49.015
He just wants to ask you
a couple of questions...

30:49.050 --> 30:53.200
about what you saw the night
that the judge was, um...

30:53.235 --> 30:57.528
- Brutally slain.
- Yeah. That's right.

30:58.043 --> 31:00.764
- Is he a policeman?
- He was.

31:00.799 --> 31:02.635
- What happened?
- I had a breakdown.

31:02.670 --> 31:05.958
I was nearly catatonic for
about three and a half years.

31:09.127 --> 31:10.916
I already talked to the real police.

31:10.951 --> 31:12.040
Three times.

31:12.075 --> 31:16.167
I know, but Mr. Monk has
a different way of looking at things.

31:16.202 --> 31:17.859
Make them buy some lemonade.

31:17.894 --> 31:19.590
I'll only talk if you buy some lemonade.

31:19.625 --> 31:20.918
That's the rule.

31:20.953 --> 31:22.688
Oh. Okay.

31:23.061 --> 31:24.574
He has to buy some too.

31:24.609 --> 31:27.434
No-No, thanks.

31:27.469 --> 31:29.291
Buy some lemonade.

31:29.767 --> 31:33.011
Okay, fine. I'll just have a small...

31:33.156 --> 31:35.089
very, very small.

31:36.072 --> 31:37.530
Yeah, that's...

31:42.796 --> 31:44.528
It's our own recipe.

31:51.268 --> 31:53.713
Mmm, that hit the spot.

31:53.954 --> 31:57.340
Thank you.
Okay, now it's your turn.

31:57.375 --> 31:59.543
I want you to think back to that night.

32:00.370 --> 32:02.016
You were walking your dog.

32:02.051 --> 32:04.226
Yeah, I was walking my dog
by the big house over there.

32:04.261 --> 32:05.914
Like I do every night.

32:05.949 --> 32:08.094
The smoke alarm went off, so I looked.

32:09.255 --> 32:13.107
And... what did you see?

32:15.456 --> 32:18.467
You familiar with the term extortion?

32:26.875 --> 32:28.652
Just drink it.

32:32.763 --> 32:33.811
Go on.

32:33.846 --> 32:36.868
So I looked, and I saw this really fat guy
in the house.

32:36.903 --> 32:40.694
No, I mean like, really fat.
Like, fat fat.

32:40.729 --> 32:41.619
Yeah, fat.

32:41.654 --> 32:44.691
Then he opened the curtains, stood
on the chair and turned off the alarm.

32:44.726 --> 32:48.244
Okay, Sue Ellen,
I just want to be absolutely sure.

32:48.279 --> 32:52.767
The alarm sounded,
and then you saw the curtains open up?

33:01.356 --> 33:03.170
Oh, look at that.

33:10.037 --> 33:11.266
Is that right?

33:11.301 --> 33:13.214
Smoke alarm and then the curtains?

33:13.249 --> 33:14.084
Yep.

33:14.119 --> 33:17.592
Why would he open the curtains
before he turns off the alarm?

33:18.223 --> 33:19.845
He was putting on a show.

33:19.880 --> 33:21.501
What kind of show?

33:22.339 --> 33:24.984
He was putting on a show for you.

33:28.595 --> 33:32.916
Adrian. Adrian.
Sit and stop it.

33:32.951 --> 33:34.633
Okay. - Just sit!

33:40.244 --> 33:44.385
Adrian, you know how much
I like this guy, Dr. Vezza, right?

33:44.420 --> 33:47.033
- Uh-huh.
- Okay. Now, look at me, please.

33:47.068 --> 33:50.787
I know you're gonna embarrass me,
and I know you can't help yourself.

33:50.822 --> 33:52.700
But I am just asking you...

33:52.735 --> 33:54.662
No, you know what, I am begging you,

33:54.697 --> 33:58.692
if you can just try not to embarrass me
too much. - Uh-huh.

33:59.553 --> 34:02.346
Just one or two questions and you're done.

34:02.381 --> 34:03.195
Hello.

34:03.459 --> 34:07.842
Oh. Doctor. Doctor, sorry to bother you.
I hope this isn't a bad time.

34:07.877 --> 34:09.478
Actually, I'm in the middle of a session,

34:09.514 --> 34:13.766
but, uh, yes,
I think I can spare a few minutes.

34:14.085 --> 34:15.784
- Hey there.
- Hi.

34:16.820 --> 34:19.228
I'm, uh, really looking forward
to Friday night.

34:19.264 --> 34:21.833
- I hope you like Thai.
- Oh, I love Thai.

34:21.869 --> 34:23.951
Oh, good. Because
there's a new place at the

34:23.952 --> 34:25.940
Embarcadero that I hear is just fantastic.

34:25.976 --> 34:29.052
Doctor, uh, just wanted to ask you,
uh, - One.

34:29.087 --> 34:33.706
A couple of questions about
your benefactor Mr. Biederbeck.

34:33.741 --> 34:36.873
Miss Fleming was at his apartment
last night... - I heard.

34:36.909 --> 34:39.232
Whatever he paid you, it wasn't enough.

34:39.266 --> 34:40.728
While she was there,

34:40.764 --> 34:43.946
Miss Fleming happened to notice
some videotapes of Judge Lavinio.

34:43.981 --> 34:45.431
Do you know anything about them?

34:45.467 --> 34:46.955
Yes, I recorded them.

34:46.989 --> 34:50.420
They were, uh, TV interviews,
uh, news clips.

34:50.455 --> 34:52.077
We're fine with that.

34:52.112 --> 34:53.661
You're done.

34:53.857 --> 34:57.238
Yes, and do you know
why Mr. Biederbeck wanted them?

34:57.273 --> 34:59.406
He was absolutely obsessed with her.

34:59.441 --> 35:00.921
He wanted to know everything about her.

35:00.956 --> 35:03.556
- And, Doctor...
- Oh, my God. What is that?

35:03.591 --> 35:08.219
Ah, this is the self-esteem mirror.
It's one of my inventions.

35:08.254 --> 35:10.289
Now, this is what you look like,

35:10.324 --> 35:14.141
and this is the inner you.
This is the you we're working toward.

35:14.176 --> 35:17.880
L-I love this. Best bud, right?

35:17.915 --> 35:18.868
Excuse me.

35:20.015 --> 35:23.736
I see you found another of my inventions.

35:23.967 --> 35:27.606
- The empathy suit.
- Dr. Vezza?

35:28.246 --> 35:29.591
Who had a birthday?

35:29.626 --> 35:31.075
Oh, mine, actually.

35:31.110 --> 35:33.590
Last week.
You missed a great party.

35:38.325 --> 35:40.021
You're 37.

35:40.056 --> 35:45.187
Yes. I was conceived during
the big blackout of 1965.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.003
Would you excuse me?

35:53.341 --> 35:57.114
We really have to work on our
"Not embarrassing Sharona skills."

35:57.149 --> 35:59.245
- Thirty-seven.
- What?

35:59.280 --> 36:00.577
He's 37.

36:01.926 --> 36:03.580
So what?

36:04.005 --> 36:09.042
If he's 37-years-old,
then I know how the judge was killed.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.502
Did you get the red dress I sent you?

36:23.100 --> 36:26.116
This is too weird just talking to a camera.

36:26.623 --> 36:28.382
Do you want me to wear it?

36:28.417 --> 36:31.175
That's the idea, sweetheart.

36:34.342 --> 36:35.751
It's Captain Stottlemeyer.

36:38.244 --> 36:40.971
- Hello, Mr. Biederbeck.
- Captain.

36:41.006 --> 36:45.003
I really wish you would've called.
I'm a little busy at the moment.

36:45.038 --> 36:48.270
I'm here to arrest you for the murder
of Judge Kate Lavinio.

36:48.764 --> 36:51.547
That's a warrant. Duly sworn.

36:51.758 --> 36:53.992
Sweetheart, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

36:55.493 --> 36:57.546
Doctor, will you call Howard Klein...

36:57.581 --> 37:01.261
and tell him we're suing the city
for malicious prosecution... again.

37:01.296 --> 37:04.792
I have hired a local construction
company to take out this door.

37:04.827 --> 37:08.092
We're gonna get a crane here and
lower your fat ass down to the street.

37:08.127 --> 37:10.929
A crane? Oh, that's rich.

37:10.964 --> 37:12.330
But would you mind explaining to me

37:12.365 --> 37:14.585
how I'm supposed to have killed the bitch?

37:14.620 --> 37:17.575
I can't leave this room, remember?

37:18.431 --> 37:19.846
Mr. Monk.

37:20.751 --> 37:22.754
Well, my, my, my.

37:22.789 --> 37:26.426
It's the defective detective once more.

37:27.805 --> 37:30.109
Lay it on me, Einstein.

37:30.825 --> 37:34.173
These two chairs are
from the judge's house.

37:34.547 --> 37:38.534
The killer stood on one of them
when he turned off the smoke alarm.

37:38.569 --> 37:44.684
A girl in the neighborhood saw, quote,
a very, very fat man standing on it.

37:45.253 --> 37:48.112
But there's something
funny about the chair.

37:50.216 --> 37:52.102
It's not broken.

37:52.376 --> 37:54.943
This is Sergeant Cargill
from the 14th Precinct.

37:54.978 --> 37:56.716
Sergeant, how much do you weigh?

37:56.751 --> 37:59.889
- 265.
- Would you mind?

38:05.064 --> 38:08.999
So how could a very, very fat man...

38:09.034 --> 38:10.868
have stood on it?

38:11.047 --> 38:14.371
There's only one explanation.
He was a fat man.

38:15.285 --> 38:18.773
Not a heavy man. Lieutenant.

38:22.924 --> 38:27.540
I visited your clinic today and
borrowed one of your empathy suits.

38:28.962 --> 38:32.364
Fat, but not heavy.

38:33.976 --> 38:36.566
I believe we have
another warrant to serve.

38:39.229 --> 38:40.323
You're joking.

38:40.358 --> 38:41.850
You were in it together.

38:41.885 --> 38:43.934
You killed her.

38:43.969 --> 38:46.668
Fat man planned it,
but you did it.

38:47.274 --> 38:50.521
It was brilliant.
You killed her,

38:50.556 --> 38:55.510
and then you left clues behind to make
it look like Biederbeck did it. Why?

38:55.545 --> 39:00.308
Because he's the only person on Earth
that couldn't possibly have done it.

39:00.507 --> 39:04.739
You wore enormous boots
to leave big footprints.

39:04.774 --> 39:06.053
Breaking in was no problem.

39:06.088 --> 39:09.357
The housekeeper told you
about the hide-a-key.

39:09.629 --> 39:14.645
I admit I was confused until
I figured out the sequence of events.

39:14.680 --> 39:16.829
First, you killed the judge.

39:17.912 --> 39:21.326
Then you ransacked the house.

39:21.361 --> 39:23.503
Of course, you needed a witness.

39:23.617 --> 39:25.953
You put on one of your fat suits,
set off the alarm,

39:25.988 --> 39:30.376
then waited until you were sure
somebody was watching.

39:32.468 --> 39:34.864
And, finally, you called 911.

39:34.899 --> 39:36.638
And you're great with voices, Doctor.

39:36.673 --> 39:40.014
He's in the house.
He's right downstairs.

39:40.123 --> 39:42.735
Biederbeck even supplied
you with videotapes

39:42.736 --> 39:44.825
of the judge so you could practice.

39:44.860 --> 39:46.446
This is insane.

39:46.707 --> 39:48.496
Why would I risk everything?

39:48.531 --> 39:52.060
You really didn't have a choice,
did you, Glenn?

39:53.327 --> 39:57.382
I knew Christiaan wasn't your real name
soon as you said you were 37 years old.

39:57.417 --> 40:01.393
You told Sharona that you were named
after Christiaan Barnard,

40:01.428 --> 40:06.163
but he wasn't famous until 1967.

40:06.198 --> 40:08.343
After you were born.

40:08.378 --> 40:10.304
I put the F. B. I. On it.

40:10.339 --> 40:12.209
They were looking for you.

40:12.438 --> 40:15.168
Your real name is Glenn Q Sindell.

40:15.203 --> 40:17.279
You killed a child five years ago.

40:17.314 --> 40:18.225
Accident.

40:18.260 --> 40:22.033
You were operating on her so doped up,
you couldn't see straight.

40:22.068 --> 40:22.704
Accident.

40:22.739 --> 40:25.485
Convicted of manslaughter
and reckless endangerment,

40:25.520 --> 40:27.418
you were looking at 15 years minimum.

40:27.453 --> 40:30.816
You jumped bail before sentencing,
and then you disappeared.

40:30.851 --> 40:32.291
Until now.

40:32.988 --> 40:36.708
And somehow, somehow,
Biederbeck learned your secret.

40:36.743 --> 40:40.715
From that moment on, he owned you,
didn't he?

40:40.750 --> 40:46.017
Listen, I just have to say,
fantastic work, really.

40:46.052 --> 40:48.076
Both of you, kudos.

40:48.111 --> 40:51.418
And-And for the record,
I am shocked, shocked,

40:51.453 --> 40:56.087
that my personal physician is
both a fugitive and a cold-blooded killer.

40:56.122 --> 40:58.240
Shocked. But...

40:58.275 --> 41:02.087
you can't really tie me to the crime,
can you?

41:02.122 --> 41:05.165
Well, now, that really depends
on Mr. Sindell.

41:05.200 --> 41:06.991
What do you say, Glenn?

41:07.139 --> 41:08.960
Would you like to talk to us?

41:08.995 --> 41:11.018
It'll be my pleasure.

41:11.498 --> 41:13.998
I'm looking forward to
testifying against you.

41:14.033 --> 41:17.460
Maybe once and for all, I can
redeem myself for everything I've done.

41:17.495 --> 41:19.732
All the pain I've caused.

41:19.935 --> 41:21.561
I detest you.

41:21.596 --> 41:24.912
- Do you?
- With every fiber of my being.

41:25.643 --> 41:28.490
Biederbeck, you're an abomination.

41:28.772 --> 41:33.248
An odious, gluttonous,
putrid freak of nature.

41:33.283 --> 41:37.027
Wow, it's been a long time
since anyone's called me that.

41:37.062 --> 41:40.218
Listen, by the time my lawyers
are through with you,

41:40.253 --> 41:42.770
you're not gonna know which end is up.

41:42.805 --> 41:45.916
There's not a prison in the country
that can hold me.

41:45.951 --> 41:48.650
There's very few shopping malls
that can hold you.

41:49.812 --> 41:53.307
But, nonetheless,
we're gonna give it a try.

41:53.571 --> 41:55.018
You...

42:00.523 --> 42:02.256
What's he doing?

42:02.291 --> 42:04.377
I think he's trying to kill me.

42:08.008 --> 42:10.514
Wasn't really much of a fight, was it?

42:15.256 --> 42:18.810
Adrian, can I ask you something?

42:18.845 --> 42:22.158
And if it's none of my business,
I promise I'll shut up.

42:22.193 --> 42:23.450
I doubt it.

42:27.946 --> 42:30.484
What did Trudy mean by bread and butter?

42:32.181 --> 42:36.905
Whenever Trudy and I were
walking somewhere, we'd hold hands.

42:36.940 --> 42:40.304
If there was a lamppost or somebody
walked between us,

42:40.339 --> 42:43.608
and we had to let go for a second,

42:43.888 --> 42:47.449
she'd always say "bread and butter."

42:47.684 --> 42:49.032
So when she died?

42:49.067 --> 42:51.687
Yeah, I think it was a message for me.

42:52.062 --> 42:53.728
She was saying,

42:53.763 --> 42:57.443
"I have to let go now for a little while...

42:57.696 --> 43:00.739
but it won't be forever."
