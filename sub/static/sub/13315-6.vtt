Reedus:
<i>I really like riding</i>
<i>with a partner.</i>

00:09.076 --> 00:11.243
I like the rumble
and then the following rumble.

00:11.245 --> 00:13.712
Yeah, baby.

00:13.714 --> 00:15.647
Hi, little
florida chicken.

00:15.649 --> 00:18.717
<i>And they came up with the idea</i>
<i>they were in jail.</i>

00:18.719 --> 00:21.286
- This gal was into free love.
- What's wrong with that?

00:21.288 --> 00:23.555
- Norman reedus!
- "walking dead," whoo!

00:23.557 --> 00:25.457
- For the record,
she just touched my butt.
- Okay, guys, look this way.

00:25.459 --> 00:28.460
I can't even catch my cat.
No way I can catch a gator.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.362
This is where,
like, you kill somebody
and dump their body.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.465
I myself will eat anything
that can eat me.

00:33.467 --> 00:34.767
<i>A sculpture you can ride.</i>

00:34.769 --> 00:36.602
- A rocket ship.
-  <i>Rocket ships.</i>

00:36.604 --> 00:39.304
How'd you get hooked up
with peter ( bleep ) fonda?

00:39.306 --> 00:42.541
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

00:55.655 --> 00:57.556
<i>( projector whirring )</i>

00:59.659 --> 01:02.728
Reedus:
<i>From the very first time</i>
<i>I saw bikers on the big screen,</i>

01:02.730 --> 01:05.097
<i>I was hooked.</i>

01:05.099 --> 01:07.733
<i>The rebellion,</i>
<i>the recklessness, the danger.</i>

01:07.735 --> 01:11.336
<i>Man, everything about those</i>
<i>old biker films was cool.</i>

01:11.338 --> 01:13.372
<i>I wanted to be</i>
<i>one of those guys.</i>

01:13.374 --> 01:15.707
<i>They rode hard</i>
<i>and they lived free.</i>

01:15.709 --> 01:18.710
<i>But to me</i>
<i>and an entire generation</i>

01:18.712 --> 01:22.548
<i>There was only one rider</i>
<i>who stood out from the rest--</i>

01:22.550 --> 01:24.116
The easy rider.

01:28.188 --> 01:30.689
<i>Today I'm stoked to be taking</i>
<i>a ride through florida</i>

01:30.691 --> 01:32.357
<i>With a motorcycle guru,</i>

01:32.359 --> 01:35.327
<i>Captain america himself,</i>
<i>peter fonda.</i>

01:37.597 --> 01:39.565
<i>One of my all-time heroes.</i>

01:58.518 --> 02:00.519
Joe's diner.
Joe's diner.

02:00.521 --> 02:03.489
Very good food
at joe's diner.

02:03.491 --> 02:06.158
Reedus:
<i>Peter fonda and I go back</i>
<i>a couple years.</i>

02:06.160 --> 02:09.695
<i>We met filming the sequel</i>
<i>to "the boondock saints."</i>

02:09.697 --> 02:11.730
<i>We talked about taking a ride</i>
<i>through the everglades</i>

02:11.732 --> 02:13.398
<i>And down into the keys</i>

02:13.400 --> 02:15.134
<i>Where peter called home</i>
<i>in the '70s.</i>

02:15.136 --> 02:17.136
Man:
<i>Good food.</i>

02:17.138 --> 02:20.172
Reedus:
<i>So we're meeting</i>
<i>at the gateway to the glades</i>

02:20.174 --> 02:23.342
- How are you, buddy?
- Pretty good, buddy.
How about yourself?

02:23.344 --> 02:25.210
- Good to see you, man.
- Good to see you.

02:25.212 --> 02:26.812
Yeah. Yeah!

02:26.814 --> 02:28.480
- Good to see you, buddy.
- There we go.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.716
I'm taking a ride
with peter fonda.

02:30.718 --> 02:32.718
This is like
a dream come true.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.454
- I'm taking a ride
with norman reedus.
- ( laughs )

02:35.456 --> 02:37.456
Reedus:
<i>Peter fonda--</i>

02:37.458 --> 02:40.192
<i>This dude has lived</i>
<i>one hell of an epic life.</i>

02:40.194 --> 02:43.729
<i>Son of henry,</i>
<i>brother of jane,</i>
<i>father of bridget.</i>

02:43.731 --> 02:46.465
<i>He's been in the family</i>
<i>business for over six decades.</i>

02:46.467 --> 02:48.467
<i>With over 100 credits</i>
<i>to his name,</i>

02:48.469 --> 02:50.369
<i>Peter is a hollywood legend.</i>

02:50.371 --> 02:55.240
<i>Best known for riding</i>
<i>and starring in "easy rider."</i>

02:55.242 --> 02:59.211
<i>But to me, peter's much more</i>
<i>than an actor.</i>

02:59.213 --> 03:05.617
<i>For him, I might not</i>
<i>have ever gotten on a bike</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

03:05.619 --> 03:07.686
The last time I saw you,

03:07.688 --> 03:09.588
You were falling through
a glass window

03:09.590 --> 03:12.724
With two big automatic
pistols just shooting
the hell out of me.

03:12.726 --> 03:16.395
That's right.
Actually, the first time
we ever met--

03:16.397 --> 03:19.298
I don't know if you remember,
it was in los angeles.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.699
I used to live up
by the hollywood sign.

03:20.701 --> 03:24.369
I had an "easy rider" poster
that was in my bathroom.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.372
And I don't know,
I think maybe you were filming
a commercial up there.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.641
I looked outside,
and I heard all this noise,

03:29.643 --> 03:32.911
And I'm like, "holy ( bleep ).
That's peter fonda."

03:32.913 --> 03:34.813
And then you
knocked on my door

03:34.815 --> 03:37.449
And asked if you could
use our phone.

03:37.451 --> 03:40.252
And I said, "sure, but you
have to sign this poster."

03:40.254 --> 03:42.688
And I think you wrote,
"ride hard or stay home."

03:42.690 --> 03:44.923
- Is that your thing?
Yeah, it was great.
- Yeah, that's it.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.792
- Ride hard or stay home.
- And I still have that poster
to this day.

03:46.794 --> 03:48.760
- Oh, that's cool.
- Yeah.

03:48.762 --> 03:50.596
Are you from here?
Is that correct?

03:50.598 --> 03:52.965
Well, I used to have
a place down in key west

03:52.967 --> 03:55.934
From '74
through the early '80s.

04:01.374 --> 04:04.276
<i>I was shooting a movie in '74</i>
<i>called "92 in the shade,"</i>

04:04.278 --> 04:07.980
<i>And I ended up</i>
<i>staying down there.</i>

04:09.682 --> 04:12.384
<i>When I was down there,</i>
<i>crosby, stills and nash</i>

04:12.386 --> 04:14.620
Were recording
down in miami,

04:14.622 --> 04:18.857
So I would drive up
and hang with them in
the recording booth

04:18.859 --> 04:21.760
And do claps or doo-wops
or whatever in the background.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.296
Have fun
and listen to the music.
I loved that.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.465
I love your stories.
Oh, I just rode down there

04:26.467 --> 04:27.833
And hung out with crosby,
stills and nash.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.434
- Absolutely.
- <i>I love it.</i>

04:29.436 --> 04:32.904
I came back once in '86
to see jimmy buffett

04:32.906 --> 04:36.975
And a friend of mine
you'll meet down there
benjamin bruce.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.678
I'm excited
to meet all your friends,
to do this ride.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.546
<i>We'll meet some friends</i>
<i>I'm sure.</i>

04:41.548 --> 04:43.915
You know, this is the first
time I'll have been riding.

04:43.917 --> 04:47.386
I drove a lot, but I never
took a motorcycle down there.

04:47.388 --> 04:49.054
- <i>Completely different</i>
<i> on a motorcycle. </i>
<i>- Yeah, you bet.</i>

04:49.056 --> 04:51.857
So this is gonna
be my first time
outside the cage.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.592
I love it.

04:53.594 --> 04:58.463
Reedus: <i>It's really cool.</i>
<i>It's a super comfortable</i>
<i>motorcycle.</i>

04:58.465 --> 05:01.333
<i>I'm riding</i>
<i>a triumph tiger 800xc.</i>

05:01.335 --> 05:05.604
<i>With its 799cc</i>
<i>inline-three engine,</i>

05:05.606 --> 05:08.006
<i>It's a perfect combination</i>
<i>of power and torque</i>

05:08.008 --> 05:09.841
<i>For on</i>
<i>and off road riding.</i>

05:09.843 --> 05:11.777
Plus it has all these
very posh features.

05:11.779 --> 05:15.013
Grip warmers,
seat warmers
front and back.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.749
- A seat warmer?
- Yeah, and it rides
like a dream.

05:17.751 --> 05:19.318
What do you got
over here?

05:19.320 --> 05:21.486
Fonda:
<i>This is the thunderbird storm.</i>

05:21.488 --> 05:25.023
Reedus:
<i>Peter's thunderbird storm</i>
<i>is a classic muscle cruiser.</i>

05:25.025 --> 05:27.759
<i>1699cc with a parallel</i>
<i>twin engine.</i>

05:27.761 --> 05:29.895
<i>It's pure rolling thunder.</i>

05:29.897 --> 05:32.898
It's low gravity.
It's not rigid like
the "easy rider" bike.

05:32.900 --> 05:36.468
- Can I sit on it?
- <i>Yeah, throw a leg over it.</i>
<i> Don't worry about it.</i>

05:36.470 --> 05:38.570
Wow.
This is like a cadillac.

05:38.572 --> 05:41.673
We'll call it
a coupe de ville
for the ride.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.508
<i>You know, I was</i>
<i>actually born in florida.</i>

05:43.510 --> 05:45.711
I think I lived
here like three days
or something.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.879
I don't really know
much about it,

05:47.881 --> 05:49.748
But I'm excited to get
to the end of key west.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.917
Yeah, let's go.
I'm gonna take you
down this road.

05:51.919 --> 05:55.387
I know these guys and they
really are knowledgeable
about the glades.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.923
- And they're
into motorcycles.
- Perfect.

05:57.925 --> 05:59.458
- Okay, let's do it.
- Cool.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.564
All right,
I'm following you.

06:05.566 --> 06:08.100
<i>( music playing )</i>

06:10.937 --> 06:13.405
- Loving this.
- Yeah.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.941
I just like the idea
of rolling through florida
with peter fonda.

06:15.943 --> 06:18.677
- Awesome.
- ( laughs )

06:18.679 --> 06:21.646
Who's better
on a motorcycle,
you or dennis hopper?

06:21.648 --> 06:25.417
- Me.
- I knew it.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.686
Reedus:
<i>It's not every day you get to</i>
<i>ride with one of your idols,</i>

06:27.688 --> 06:30.455
<i>So I'm taking</i>
<i>full advantage.</i>

06:30.457 --> 06:33.959
<i>We're starting out</i>
<i>in naples on the western</i>
<i>edge of the everglades.</i>

06:33.961 --> 06:37.062
<i>We'll ride 120 miles</i>
<i>through 1.5 million acres</i>

06:37.064 --> 06:39.030
<i>Of the swampiest wetlands</i>
<i>in america,</i>

06:39.032 --> 06:40.732
<i>Ending up in miami.</i>

06:40.734 --> 06:42.701
<i>Then we're taking</i>
<i>the overseas highway</i>

06:42.703 --> 06:44.803
<i>Passing through 1,700 coral</i>

06:44.805 --> 06:47.672
<i>And limestone islands</i>
<i>that make up the keys</i>

06:47.674 --> 06:49.107
<i>Until we reach</i>
<i>the southernmost point</i>

06:49.109 --> 06:51.543
<i>Of the continental us,</i>
<i>key west.</i>

06:58.718 --> 07:00.552
- This it?
- This is it.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.187
You gotta meet these guys.

07:02.189 --> 07:05.056
<i>"mohawk" playing</i>

07:05.058 --> 07:07.692
Reedus:
<i>It's been a while since</i>
<i>peter lived in florida.</i>

07:07.694 --> 07:11.563
- Hello, hello!
- <i>But he's kept in touch with</i>
<i> the local bike scene here.</i>

07:11.565 --> 07:13.899
<i>Those places are always great</i>
<i>for grabbing the best routes</i>

07:13.901 --> 07:16.101
<i>And must-see stops.</i>

07:16.103 --> 07:18.136
<i>Plus he tells me that</i>
<i>this tiny shop</i>

07:18.138 --> 07:20.605
<i>Is actually a world-class</i>
<i>custom built mecca</i>

07:20.607 --> 07:23.742
<i>That deals exclusively</i>
<i>in rare vintage harleys.</i>

07:23.744 --> 07:25.977
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, brian.

07:25.979 --> 07:27.946
Tyler.
Nice to meet you, dude.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.648
You know everything
about the glades.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.082
Reedus:
<i>Check out those grins.</i>

07:31.084 --> 07:32.751
<i>But who can blame them?</i>

07:32.753 --> 07:34.085
<i>If these brothers</i>
<i>are anything like me...</i>

07:34.087 --> 07:35.654
Fonda:
<i>Isn't that a sweet one?</i>

07:35.656 --> 07:37.489
<i>..."easy rider"</i>
<i>was their bible, too.</i>

07:37.491 --> 07:39.624
Tyler:
<i>We just built the chassis</i>
<i>around it.</i>

07:39.626 --> 07:42.160
- <i>It's always turbo. </i>
<i>- Fonda:</i> <i>All right.</i>

07:42.162 --> 07:44.696
- This is a harley?
- That's the liberator
edition.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.097
Fonda:
<i>The first time I've seen it.</i>

07:46.099 --> 07:48.533
Tyler:
<i>Harley did that in, like, '73</i>

07:48.535 --> 07:50.669
<i>To '76, I think.</i>

07:50.671 --> 07:53.672
There was, like, 1,500
of them made so it's
a pretty rare bike.

07:53.674 --> 07:59.010
41, the road that goes,
you know, from, like,
tampa to miami

07:59.012 --> 08:00.479
Through the swamp out there,
through the everglades.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.013
- Excellent.
- You swamp ride it?

08:02.015 --> 08:04.182
- Yeah.
- Do you get
completely filthy?

08:04.184 --> 08:07.085
- Yeah, pretty much.
- In my other job I'm filthy
all the time.

08:07.087 --> 08:09.921
- Yeah.
- Fonda: <i>Oh, norman,</i>
<i> you're such a dirty actor.</i>

08:09.923 --> 08:12.691
- This'll be my first
ride across it.
- Really?

08:12.693 --> 08:14.626
- I can't wait.
- Yeah, it gorgeous
out there.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.629
Do you see alligators
all the time when you ride?

08:17.631 --> 08:19.264
They'll lay
straight across it.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.833
What do you do?
Do you just pull up
and wait for them to go?

08:21.835 --> 08:23.535
Brian:
<i>We used to catch them</i>
<i>growing up.</i>

08:23.537 --> 08:26.605
I can't even catch my cat.
No way I can catch a gator.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.073
- You ever eaten alligator?
- <i>No.</i>

08:28.075 --> 08:30.642
You'll have to stop
by joanie's on 41.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.110
They'll feed you
some gator out there.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.945
Can we please do that?

08:33.947 --> 08:40.685
But we can make time to at least
kinda show you guys out
where joanie's is out there.

08:40.687 --> 08:41.920
- Thanks, guys.
- It's gonna be cool.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.522
<i>Except for the alligators.</i>

08:43.524 --> 08:45.257
You jump the gator,
I'll jump the shark.

08:45.259 --> 08:46.958
- <i>Done. </i>
<i>- There you go.</i>
<i>  Just like the fonz.</i>

08:46.960 --> 08:49.961
- Let's do it.
- Kick the tires
and light the fires.

With warren oates
and traveled around europe.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.965
I picked up a mercedes 6.3,

09:26.967 --> 09:29.334
At that time the fastest
sedan in the world.

<i>so high... ♪</i>

09:59.765 --> 10:02.901
Definitely looks like
alligator territory to me.

10:02.903 --> 10:05.003
Yeah, we're in
gator alley.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.739
These brothers better
show us some alligators.

10:09.910 --> 10:15.180
<i>This is where,</i>
<i>like, you kill somebody</i>
<i>and dump their body.</i>

10:15.182 --> 10:18.183
That's really
a gruesome thing to be
talking about like this.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.719
Yeah, no, it's good.
I like talking about it.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.921
- ( laughs )
- it's good to know.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.258
Yeah.

10:27.260 --> 10:31.830
They just waved us on.
Later, man.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.065
Reedus:
<i>The thrill</i>
<i>of the open road.</i>

10:34.067 --> 10:36.334
<i>The promise of the next</i>
<i>experience.</i>

10:36.336 --> 10:38.036
<i>That's what keeps</i>
<i>you going.</i>

10:38.038 --> 10:40.005
<i>Riding keeps you</i>
<i>young at heart.</i>

10:40.007 --> 10:44.743
<i>He's done it all and he still</i>
<i>can't stop exploring.</i>

10:44.745 --> 10:47.112
<i>Hopefully I'm gonna</i>
<i>end up just like that.</i>

10:50.349 --> 10:53.318
And the name lucky,
is that because you're
photographing naked models?

10:53.320 --> 10:55.086
- Want to swap? Trade bikes?
- Yeah, let's do it.

10:55.088 --> 10:58.056
"walking dead," whoo!

11:12.838 --> 11:15.707
<i>( people chatting )</i>

11:19.912 --> 11:21.713
Reedus:
<i>You must get a lot</i>
<i>of bikers coming in.</i>

11:21.715 --> 11:24.182
Slap full of crap,
I ain't gonna lie to you.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.985
That's the reason that says
biker parking only.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.054
I do get some
repeat customers,

11:29.056 --> 11:31.122
But most of them are just
people that are driving by.

11:31.124 --> 11:34.259
A lot of harleys.
A lot of bikers.
Good people.

11:34.261 --> 11:35.860
- Do you ride as well?
- I don't.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.862
But I'm looking for a guy
with a harley, though,

11:37.864 --> 11:40.098
So if you know one,
you send him to me
'cause I'm ready.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.234
Actually, there's a guy
back there in a white
jacket right now.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.270
- I will take him.
- He's been in lots
of movies.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.138
I will take him.
I will go.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.140
I guarantee it.
Guarantee it.

11:49.142 --> 11:51.743
Reedus:
<i>40 miles into our ride</i>
<i>to miami</i>

11:51.745 --> 11:54.713
<i>On a two-lane straightaway</i>
<i>surrounded by gators,</i>

11:54.715 --> 11:55.914
<i>Joanie's is hard to miss.</i>

11:55.916 --> 11:57.315
Look at this scary
clown right here.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.850
<i>For 30 years,</i>
<i>this swamp shack</i>

11:58.852 --> 12:00.385
<i>Has been serving up</i>
<i>big portions</i>

12:00.387 --> 12:02.153
<i>And even bigger</i>
<i>personalities</i>

12:02.155 --> 12:05.123
<i>In the oldest existing</i>
<i>building in the everglades.</i>

12:05.125 --> 12:06.891
<i>It's authentic places</i>
<i>like this</i>

12:06.893 --> 12:09.360
<i>That makes getting to know</i>
<i>peter's world that much easier.</i>

12:09.362 --> 12:12.197
- Yeah, let's do it.
Oh, oh, she touched my butt.
- ( laughing )

12:12.199 --> 12:15.767
<i>Get in here.</i>
<i>This is the photo</i>
<i>right here.</i>

12:15.769 --> 12:17.268
- Come on in.
- Get in here.

12:17.270 --> 12:18.970
( all laugh )

12:18.972 --> 12:22.774
This man's got boobs
all over him right now.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.442
- I hope you're warm.
- Whoo-hoo!

12:24.444 --> 12:26.144
All right, here.
Have a seat.

12:26.146 --> 12:29.481
I've been playing phone tag
with benjamin curry bruce.

12:29.483 --> 12:31.382
- Of key west.
- Okay.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.985
Ernest hemingway gave
him the nickname of dink.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.754
- Why?
- 'cause he had
a long schlong.

12:35.756 --> 12:38.923
- Oh, wow. No way.
- He's a short guy, too.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.792
So did you get in contact
with this guy?

12:40.794 --> 12:42.794
I'll catch him as soon
as I get back to my phone.

12:42.796 --> 12:45.797
Here we go, guys.
I've got a swamp combo
going your way.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.165
Did she call this
a swamp combo?

12:47.167 --> 12:49.467
- Swamp combo.
- Yeah, swamp combo.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.803
This is my first frog leg.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.872
- Huh-huh.
- ( laughs )

12:53.874 --> 12:56.808
I'll try tartar first.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.477
It does taste
like chicken.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.946
Let's do a gator bite.

13:01.948 --> 13:05.917
- <i>Put some sauce in you. </i>
<i>- I'm going au naturel.</i>

13:06.252 --> 13:08.820
What a fight, though.
Do you get the gator
and eat it,

13:08.822 --> 13:10.255
Or does the gator
get you and eat it?

13:10.257 --> 13:14.492
I myself will eat anything
that can eat me.

13:14.494 --> 13:16.361
That's why I eat
my gator meat.

13:16.363 --> 13:21.166
It's savory.
It's almost chicken and like
calamari mixed together.

13:21.168 --> 13:26.070
Fonda:
<i>You working in</i>
<i>your own cooking show?</i>

13:26.072 --> 13:28.273
My own cooking show, yeah.
Anthony bourdain, eat
your heart out.

13:28.275 --> 13:31.075
What do you suggest?
What else on our way

13:31.077 --> 13:33.344
<i>Can we see</i>
<i>some really wild stuff?</i>

13:33.346 --> 13:35.847
- On the way to key west.
- Go up the road here,

13:35.849 --> 13:38.316
- And go see
mr. Lucky cole.
- Lucky cole?

13:38.318 --> 13:41.820
Lucky cole does our pictures
that we have hanging on the hall
and in the bathroom.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.489
- In the bathroom. Yeah.
- Really?

13:47.259 --> 13:48.993
Lisa:
<i>You've got to go see him.</i>

13:48.995 --> 13:50.862
Reedus:
<i>And the name lucky,</i>
<i>is that because</i>

13:50.864 --> 13:52.864
He's constantly
photographing naked people?

13:52.866 --> 13:55.166
That's a good job right there,
wouldn't it be, guys?

13:55.168 --> 13:59.070
<i>I believe it's about</i>
<i>30 miles up the road</i>
<i>if I'm not mistaken.</i>

13:59.072 --> 14:01.339
- Not bad.
- Reedus: <i>You know what?</i>
<i> Miami can wait.</i>

14:01.341 --> 14:03.408
<i>It's about</i>
<i>the journey, right?</i>

14:03.410 --> 14:04.509
- Fonda: <i>Excellent. </i>
<i>- Let's go meet him.</i>

14:04.511 --> 14:06.244
- Let's do that.
- You need to.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.246
Reedus:
<i>And in my experience,</i>

14:08.248 --> 14:10.982
<i>Go where the locals</i>
<i>tell you to go.</i>

14:10.984 --> 14:12.984
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Thank you, gals.

14:17.489 --> 14:20.124
Reedus:
<i>I'll tell you, I'm not that</i>
<i>big a fan of the gator.</i>

14:20.126 --> 14:22.460
I wasn't going to say
anything there, though.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.029
All right.
Let's go meet lucky.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.631
( laughs )

14:26.633 --> 14:31.236
<i>These wetlands attracted</i>
<i>outcasts and outlaws</i>

14:31.238 --> 14:34.205
<i>And were considered</i>
<i>the last frontier east</i>
<i>of the mississippi river.</i>

14:34.207 --> 14:37.308
<i>It's a spirit that still</i>
<i>lives on today.</i>

14:37.310 --> 14:40.078
Fonda:
<i>When I was in college</i>
<i>in the midwest,</i>

14:40.080 --> 14:42.947
I'd go out to this country club
<i>that my uncle belonged to</i>

14:42.949 --> 14:47.018
'cause it had a swimming
pool, and the girl who
was the lifeguard,

14:47.020 --> 14:49.187
All the boys
said, "you got to
watch out for her.

14:49.189 --> 14:51.022
She's into free love."

14:51.024 --> 14:52.523
And I thought,
"are they kidding?

14:52.525 --> 14:55.560
Watch out for her?"
( bleep )

14:55.562 --> 14:57.362
I just went right
for the gusto.

14:57.364 --> 15:00.098
This gal
was into free love?
( bleep ). I loved it.

15:00.100 --> 15:04.669
Reedus:
<i>I can see why peter's always</i>
<i>connected to this place.</i>

15:04.671 --> 15:08.273
<i>His laidback free spirit</i>
<i>fits right in in the glades.</i>

15:08.275 --> 15:10.241
Some of those pictures,
I bet he's getting lucky.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.076
<i>( fonda laughs )</i>

15:12.078 --> 15:15.313
<i>You couldn't dream up</i>
<i>a better place for peter.</i>

15:15.315 --> 15:17.148
<i>Which is why I hope</i>
<i>we find it soon.</i>

15:21.320 --> 15:25.156
I think this is it.
We go in here.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.025
<i>Yeah, we're in</i>
<i>this little driveway.</i>

15:34.667 --> 15:37.068
- Hi, how are you?
- Hey, guys.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.970
- You have a good ride?
- Yeah, it was awesome.

15:38.972 --> 15:41.205
Hi, I'm norman.
This is peter.

15:41.207 --> 15:45.343
- And this is my wife maureen.
- Maureen, peter.
Nice to meet you.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.078
- Pleasure to meet you.
- This place is awesome.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.080
Oh, I'm glad you like it.

15:52.518 --> 15:55.653
I've ridden my motorcycle
more in florida than
anywhere else.

15:55.655 --> 15:59.390
There are so few
little places like this
left in the everglades.

15:59.392 --> 16:00.725
We get a lot
of motorcycles.

16:00.727 --> 16:03.194
We get a lot
of different people.

16:03.196 --> 16:06.197
This is just your compound
art space.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.532
Lucky:
<i>This is where I do</i>
<i>most of my photography.</i>

16:07.534 --> 16:08.599
Reedus:
<i>I love it.</i>

16:09.735 --> 16:11.369
- Go on up
the steps if you want.
- Yeah.

16:11.371 --> 16:14.005
Now this is a series.
I just set up these railings.

16:14.007 --> 16:16.741
The girls called
it jailbreak, and they
came up with the idea

16:16.743 --> 16:18.977
Of doing something
where it looked like
they were in jail.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.745
- I love it.
- How do you get your models?

16:20.747 --> 16:23.681
They actually find us,
and then it's word of mouth

16:23.683 --> 16:25.984
Because somebody
does it and says, "look,
this is where you got to go

16:25.986 --> 16:28.753
If you want to do something
really different and unusual."

16:28.755 --> 16:30.655
Peter, take it off.
Let's go get behind the cage.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.423
- ( laughs )
- I want photos.

16:32.425 --> 16:34.292
Do you board bikers
here as well?

16:34.294 --> 16:36.761
I have groups
that will come and camp.
All word of mouth.

16:36.763 --> 16:40.131
Most campgrounds you go to,
you have to go quiet at 10:00.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.000
For the bikers,
what they love,
is they come here

16:42.002 --> 16:44.235
And keep the fire
going all night.
I don't care.

16:44.237 --> 16:47.071
We try to make
that kind of environment
where it's just easy,

16:47.073 --> 16:50.074
Lay back, enjoy yourself,
nobody has to rush.

16:50.076 --> 16:52.610
Your photos, they have
this real antique,

16:52.612 --> 16:55.313
-  <i>Sort of voyeuristic</i>
<i> thing going on there. </i>
<i>-</i>  <i>Thank you.</i>

16:55.315 --> 16:57.181
This is fantastic.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.550
They found your bike
from "easy rider."

16:59.552 --> 17:02.053
- My god, that's what
happened to it.
- There it is.

17:02.055 --> 17:04.389
- <i>I thought hopper sold it. </i>
<i>- Lucky:</i> <i>There you go,</i>
<i> there's a picture.</i>

17:04.391 --> 17:07.125
This is awesome.
Who am I?

17:07.127 --> 17:08.559
( maureen laughs )

17:08.561 --> 17:10.728
Look at the flag
on that bike.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.797
Look at this.
Let me show you
my addiction wall.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.700
Every picture here
is a photograph of maureen

17:15.702 --> 17:18.169
<i>Starting the late '70s</i>
<i>up until present day.</i>

17:18.171 --> 17:19.604
<i>She's a professional</i>
<i>belly dancer.</i>

17:19.606 --> 17:22.273
- <i>That's maureen. </i>
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>

17:22.275 --> 17:24.075
How did you guys meet?

17:24.077 --> 17:26.577
I was washing my car
in a bikini.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.279
( laughter )

17:28.281 --> 17:31.382
She had a brand-new
fire engine red camaro.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.351
And I knew it was
love at first sight.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.787
- Walked straight over.
That was 40 years ago.
-  <i>I had to.</i>

17:35.789 --> 17:37.288
Yeah, that's exactly
how we met.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.256
That's a great story.

17:38.258 --> 17:39.824
Thanks for showing
us around.

17:39.826 --> 17:42.093
- Maureen: Where you
guys heading now?
- Miami.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.529
- And then the keys.
- Please come back again.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.764
While you're getting
suited up, I'll grab you
a couple of business cards.

17:46.766 --> 17:49.067
- You know, I think I stole
one out of your bathroom.
- Oh, did you?

17:49.069 --> 17:50.802
- Is this you?
- I got to tell you...

17:52.638 --> 17:56.641
This is on
her 62 birthday.
She's almost 65.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.109
- Wow.
- Yeah, I know.

17:58.111 --> 17:59.710
That's what I say every time
I go to bed with her.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.479
( both laugh )

18:01.481 --> 18:05.450
Tell 'em you just
left lucky cole's place
and they'll let you go.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.385
- Have a good night, everybody.
- Have a good ride, brother.

18:07.387 --> 18:09.120
Thank you, brother.

18:11.156 --> 18:13.291
Reedus:
<i>Lucky and maureen</i>
<i>are good people.</i>

18:13.293 --> 18:14.659
<i>Only their kind</i>
<i>of hospitality</i>

18:14.661 --> 18:16.494
<i>Could turn a barren stretch</i>
<i>of swampland</i>

18:16.496 --> 18:19.097
<i>Into a biker destination.</i>

18:19.099 --> 18:20.498
<i>And for that,</i>
<i>I'm sure anyone making</i>

18:20.500 --> 18:23.367
<i>The 120-mile ride</i>
<i>is incredibly grateful.</i>

18:34.880 --> 18:37.615
<i>Day two-- miami.</i>

18:37.617 --> 18:41.119
<i>Last night we rode 50 miles</i>
<i>cutting through the heart</i>
<i>of the everglades,</i>

18:41.121 --> 18:43.221
<i>The big cypress </i>
<i>national preserve,</i>

18:43.223 --> 18:46.190
<i>Before sprawling swampland</i>
<i>turned into concrete jungle.</i>

18:48.360 --> 18:51.262
Today, before hitting the road,
<i>I want to check out miami.</i>

18:51.264 --> 18:55.766
<i>Most people know</i>
<i>this town for its beaches</i>
<i>and its nightclubs.</i>

18:55.768 --> 18:59.137
<i>But I'm here to see</i>
<i>someone my friends have</i>
<i>been raving about,</i>

18:59.139 --> 19:01.839
<i>An amazing artist</i>
<i>who combines two of</i>
<i>my favorite things--</i>

19:01.841 --> 19:03.708
<i>Motorcycles</i>
<i>and sculpture.</i>

19:05.477 --> 19:06.811
- Hi, are you bruce?
- Yes, I am.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.279
Nice to meet you.
I'm norman.

19:08.281 --> 19:09.647
- This is max.
- Max, I'm peter.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.516
- Are you friends with ponos?
- Yes, I am.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.518
- That's awesome.
- Very small world indeed.

19:13.520 --> 19:17.622
I had your captain america
poster in my bedroom.

19:17.624 --> 19:21.359
- So did I.
- Who didn't have that?

19:21.361 --> 19:23.794
Bruce:
<i>So here we are.</i>
<i>This was my sculpture studio,</i>

19:23.796 --> 19:25.796
And now
it's the motorcycle studio.

19:25.798 --> 19:28.733
- What a cool combination.
- Bruce: <i>Yeah.</i>

19:28.735 --> 19:31.469
Reedus:
<i>Building mostly from old</i>
<i>ducatis and moto guzzis,</i>

19:31.471 --> 19:34.405
<i>Two of the oldest bike</i>
<i>manufacturers in the world,</i>

19:34.407 --> 19:35.940
<i>Bruce combines parts from</i>
<i>different bikes</i>

19:35.942 --> 19:41.913
<i>To create one-of-a-kind</i>
<i>high-performing machines.</i>

19:41.915 --> 19:44.515
I have a set
of magnesium wheels
from a ducati on that.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.584
The rear shock
is from an indy car.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.252
<i>Max does all the wiring.</i>

19:48.254 --> 19:50.821
<i>We take 14 pounds</i>
<i>of wires off the bike.</i>

19:50.823 --> 19:53.591
<i>Kind of a cool situation</i>
<i>where we're able to mix</i>
<i>and match.</i>

19:53.593 --> 19:56.494
<i>I never make</i>
<i>two bikes the same.</i>

19:56.496 --> 19:58.663
Reedus:
<i>I love the board</i>
<i>with the wheels on it.</i>

19:58.665 --> 20:01.432
<i>Can you show us the process</i>
<i>of how you design a bike?</i>

20:01.434 --> 20:03.234
This is the top
of the gas tank here.

20:03.236 --> 20:05.536
This is the current
seat height on what's here.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.439
<i>I have some guys</i>
<i>that don't mind having </i>
<i>their leg bent like this.</i>

20:08.441 --> 20:10.308
But then I have
other guys, like me,

20:10.310 --> 20:11.842
That have
had some surgeries,

20:11.844 --> 20:13.678
And I need to have
a little bit less bend.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.214
I could show you
my right knee

20:16.216 --> 20:17.949
And my two titanium hips

20:17.951 --> 20:19.984
And my fused
right ankle, you bet.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.587
<i>So I play around</i>
<i>with seat height,</i>
<i>you know, foot peg height,</i>

20:22.589 --> 20:24.422
And you kind of back
into the whole concept.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.958
- A rocket ship.
- Rocket ships.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.793
Wait till you ride it.
You will dig it.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.595
<i>"the cauldron" playing</i>

20:30.597 --> 20:33.297
- ( motor revving )
- dude, let's ride.

20:37.736 --> 20:40.471
<i>♪ hallelujah </i>
<i>hallelujah ♪</i>

20:40.473 --> 20:43.574
<i>♪ pen ain't mightier</i>
<i>than the sword anymore... ♪</i>

20:43.576 --> 20:47.378
Reedus:
<i>Even on busy miami streets,</i>
<i>I'm loving this ride.</i>

20:47.380 --> 20:51.616
<i>Bruce and his team </i>
<i>have taken a minimalistic</i>
<i>redesign approach</i>

20:51.618 --> 20:54.752
<i>To this 1995 moto guzzi</i>
<i>1100 sport,</i>

20:54.754 --> 20:58.589
<i>Giving it a sleek,</i>
<i>more streamlined aesthetic</i>
<i>than the original.</i>

21:01.760 --> 21:03.461
You want to swap?
Just trade bikes?

21:03.463 --> 21:05.730
- Whenever you want.
- Let's do it.

21:07.899 --> 21:10.301
( horn honking )

21:12.604 --> 21:13.638
( honks )

21:13.640 --> 21:14.905
( laughs )

21:22.447 --> 21:23.714
Game on.

21:24.650 --> 21:25.883
Yeah, it's a little
different.

21:28.720 --> 21:31.889
Reedus:
<i>This is the same exact guzzi</i>
<i>as the one I just rode.</i>

21:31.891 --> 21:33.491
Yeah, baby.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.426
<i>It's just stripped</i>
<i>of 140 pounds</i>

21:35.428 --> 21:36.727
<i>And given</i>
<i>a rebuilt engine.</i>

21:36.729 --> 21:38.596
<i>Now a simple twist</i>
<i>of the throttle</i>

21:38.598 --> 21:41.799
<i>Creates a visceral experience</i>
<i>like no other.</i>

21:41.801 --> 21:44.802
<i>Simply put,</i>
<i>this bike hauls ass.</i>

21:50.409 --> 21:52.410
Man, this bike will just
fly down the road.

21:52.412 --> 21:55.313
Fonda:
Oh, yeah, it looks like
it could handle a lot.

21:55.315 --> 21:56.881
<i>It's got a good profile</i>
<i>in the back.</i>

21:56.883 --> 21:58.816
Yeah?

21:58.818 --> 22:01.686
Fonda:
All these people around
us are caught in cages.

22:01.688 --> 22:03.454
Doesn't matter, though.
We're on motorcycles.

22:03.456 --> 22:06.057
- <i>We can go where we want. </i>
<i>- Right?</i>

22:06.059 --> 22:09.894
-  <i>You like the freedom? </i>
<i>- I do, indeed.</i>

22:09.896 --> 22:11.595
Whoo-hoo.

22:13.465 --> 22:14.799
They're gonna tear
your bike apart.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.967
( imitates gunshot )
that's crazy.

22:16.969 --> 22:19.470
- Eek.
- Woman: Kind of love you.
Not in a weird way.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.906
- Where the ( bleep ) are we?
- ( fonda laughs )

22:27.646 --> 22:29.447
Reedus:
<i>Before heading down</i>
<i>into the keys,</i>

22:29.449 --> 22:31.882
<i>Peter and I found master</i>
<i>motorcycle sculptor</i>

22:31.884 --> 22:34.085
<i>Bruce mcquiston</i>
<i>outside miami.</i>

22:34.087 --> 22:36.921
<i>He's known for his unique</i>
<i>artistic approach</i>
<i>to bike design.</i>

22:36.923 --> 22:40.825
<i>And lucky for us,</i>
<i>we've been invited over</i>
<i>to his home for lunch.</i>

22:40.827 --> 22:42.393
- Come on in.
- Fonda: Okay, bruce.

22:42.395 --> 22:44.595
Fonda:
<i>Look at these sculptures.</i>

22:44.597 --> 22:48.766
Fonda:
<i>Isn't it? Man.</i>
<i>This is great.</i>

22:48.768 --> 22:50.534
That's what you do
with a fine art degree.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.503
That and build
motorcycles, of course.

22:52.505 --> 22:55.706
I got to tell you,
when we swapped bikes
at that red light,

22:55.708 --> 22:56.974
<i>You could</i>
<i>feel the difference</i>
<i>in the bikes.</i>

22:56.976 --> 22:58.843
- Immediately.
- Yeah.

22:58.845 --> 23:02.113
Stone crab is pretty
traditionally linked
to florida.

23:02.115 --> 23:05.082
And this is my moto studio
stone crab cracker.

23:05.084 --> 23:08.552
You know, I played around
with the motion ratio
to get it just right,

23:08.554 --> 23:10.020
Because if you use a hammer,
you squish 'em.

23:10.022 --> 23:12.390
This ends up
working pretty well.

23:12.392 --> 23:14.492
- ( cracking )
- bruce: Yup. There we go.

23:14.494 --> 23:18.562
This bit as well?

23:18.564 --> 23:23.033
<i>You immediately</i>
<i>get the feel of it.</i>

23:23.035 --> 23:24.068
( imitates motorcycle )

23:25.504 --> 23:28.072
( laughs )

23:28.074 --> 23:31.142
This is so good.
Oh, my god.

23:31.144 --> 23:33.577
What inspires you?
Like when you see
something or hear something?

23:33.579 --> 23:36.414
Well, I definitely appreciate
sophisticated motorcycles,

23:36.416 --> 23:39.016
<i>But it's the visceral</i>
<i>nature that's going away,</i>

23:39.018 --> 23:41.018
You know, in all
modern motorcycles.

23:41.020 --> 23:44.422
So part of what drives me
is I want to feel like

23:44.424 --> 23:46.857
I'm connected
to the mechanical essence
of it, you know?

23:46.859 --> 23:49.193
I had the opportunity to go
through the moto guzzi museum

23:49.195 --> 23:51.662
And the ducati museum
in the same trip.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.697
<i>And, you know, you look at</i>
<i>the early drawings</i>

23:53.699 --> 23:57.468
<i>Of what</i>
<i>these guys were thinking</i>
<i>and how it evolved.</i>

23:57.470 --> 24:00.671
<i>I'd like to think</i>
<i>that what I'm doing is still</i>
<i>connected to that.</i>

24:00.673 --> 24:05.075
That's gonna take time.
We were gonna name max's
bike mad max,

24:05.077 --> 24:06.677
But it needed
a little more dirt.

24:06.679 --> 24:09.079
- What's the name again?
- It's quasimodo.

24:09.081 --> 24:11.148
It's funny,
he came up with
the drawing at this bar.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.050
He's like,
"yeah, this is what
we're gonna do."

24:13.052 --> 24:14.552
He starts drawing
on a napkin.

24:14.554 --> 24:15.953
How many of your bikes
have been designed

24:15.955 --> 24:17.655
On a napkin
with booze involved?

24:17.657 --> 24:19.156
- I think most all of them.
- Really?

24:19.158 --> 24:21.826
- ( laughter )
- right, right, right.

24:21.828 --> 24:24.595
Reedus:
<i>You know, I'm glad I got</i>
<i>the chance to meet bruce.</i>

24:24.597 --> 24:30.201
<i>And the visionary work</i>
<i>he's doing is pushing bike</i>
<i>design into the 21st century.</i>

24:34.039 --> 24:35.840
<i>But now it's time to head</i>
<i>down to the place</i>

24:35.842 --> 24:38.609
<i>Peter fonda</i>
<i>once called home.</i>

24:38.611 --> 24:42.613
<i>From miami, it's 160 mile,</i>
<i>island-hopping ride down us 1</i>

24:42.615 --> 24:44.982
<i>Until you end up</i>
<i>in key west,</i>

24:44.984 --> 24:46.217
<i>The end of the road.</i>

24:49.921 --> 24:51.121
This is really
a sweet engine.

24:51.123 --> 24:53.224
It's got a progressive
linkage system.

24:53.226 --> 24:56.961
Peter, my butt warmer has
three different settings--

24:56.963 --> 24:59.597
Hot, medium, lukewarm.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.966
- Yeah, I needed
to know that, man.
- ( laughs )

25:01.968 --> 25:03.734
Reedus:
<i>Hanging out with one</i>
<i>of your idols</i>

25:03.736 --> 25:06.270
<i>Is a lot like when you realize</i>
<i>your parents are people</i>

25:06.272 --> 25:11.575
<i>It's like a blinder's</i>
<i>lifted and you see them</i>
<i>as they really are.</i>

25:11.577 --> 25:14.979
<i>Yet they're all the more</i>
<i>amazing because of it.</i>

25:14.981 --> 25:16.881
Let me put on
my seat warmer, peter.

25:16.883 --> 25:19.617
I'm not mad
at these grip warmers
right now, either.

25:19.619 --> 25:22.586
Feel the heat
coming off my hands,
you know what I'm saying?

25:22.588 --> 25:24.889
I'm freezing my butt
and you're talking about

25:24.891 --> 25:27.291
Warm hands and warm ass.

25:27.293 --> 25:29.927
- ( bleep ) off and die.
- ( laughs )

25:33.965 --> 25:35.633
- Reedus: Are we close?
- Yeah.

25:35.635 --> 25:37.568
Key west, ( bleep ).

25:37.570 --> 25:40.871
<i>( music playing )</i>

25:40.873 --> 25:42.873
Announcer:
<i>Out to sea in an automobile</i>

25:42.875 --> 25:45.209
<i>On a road through</i>
<i>the atlantic ocean.</i>

25:45.211 --> 25:47.678
<i>At the extreme corner</i>
<i>of the United States,</i>

25:47.680 --> 25:50.948
<i>A new 100-mile highway</i>
<i>will connect 25 islands</i>

25:50.950 --> 25:53.951
<i>That soon will be swarming</i>
<i>with tourists and fishermen</i>

25:53.953 --> 25:57.087
<i>Traveling to and from</i>
<i>famous key west.</i>

26:04.729 --> 26:07.965
Whoo!
Yeah, baby.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.900
Reedus:
<i>With nothing but two narrow</i>
<i>lanes of pavement</i>

26:09.902 --> 26:13.070
<i>Cutting between gorgeous</i>
<i>panoramic ocean views,</i>

26:13.072 --> 26:16.907
<i>Seven mile bridge</i>
<i>is an experience best</i>
<i>served on a bike</i>

26:16.909 --> 26:18.175
<i>With the sea breeze</i>
<i>in your face</i>

26:18.177 --> 26:21.779
<i>And the salt</i>
<i>on your skin.</i>

26:21.781 --> 26:23.914
Smell the ocean.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.283
It's so beautiful
on this bridge.

26:26.285 --> 26:29.753
- It's just perfect.
- It's perfect, yeah.

26:36.194 --> 26:39.029
<i>So beautiful</i>
<i>on this bridge.</i>

26:39.031 --> 26:41.332
<i>The sun is so beautiful</i>
<i>right here.</i>

26:43.702 --> 26:46.270
Reedus:
<i>You see, this is what</i>
<i>riding bikes is all about.</i>

26:46.272 --> 26:48.806
<i>Simple moments</i>
<i>that turn magical,</i>

26:48.808 --> 26:50.741
<i>And then they're gone.</i>

26:50.743 --> 26:53.177
<i>( music playing )</i>

26:56.014 --> 26:57.881
<i>But after two hours</i>
<i>on these bridges,</i>

26:57.883 --> 27:01.018
<i>I'm ready to move on</i>
<i>and hit the town.</i>

27:01.020 --> 27:04.154
Every couple of minutes,
you can go over a bridge.

27:04.156 --> 27:06.757
- Are we close?
- You can't see it yet.

27:06.759 --> 27:10.361
- Where the ( bleep )
are we right now?
- ( laughs )

27:12.964 --> 27:16.300
Yeah, baby.

27:16.302 --> 27:19.169
<i>What'd you guys do back then</i>
<i>here, like, for fun?</i>

27:19.171 --> 27:22.339
Here we would
basically get wrecked.

27:22.341 --> 27:23.707
<i>Really?</i>

27:23.709 --> 27:26.377
<i>( music playing )</i>

27:31.316 --> 27:33.150
- This one?
- Woman: <i>I like that one</i>
<i> better, too.</i>

27:33.152 --> 27:34.852
- I'll take this one.
- All right.

27:34.854 --> 27:37.121
- Hog's breath.
- Woman: <i>Nice to meet you.</i>

27:37.123 --> 27:38.255
Have a good one, guys.

27:40.725 --> 27:42.993
Eek. Can we try
this one more time,
mr. Reedus?

27:42.995 --> 27:45.362
- Yeah.
- Did that one
come out good?

27:45.364 --> 27:47.164
I live in new york.
He lives in new york.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.932
- I'm from long island.
- Oh, right on.

27:48.934 --> 27:50.401
- Yeah, a pleasure.
- Name's rico.

27:50.403 --> 27:53.771
- Norman.
- I know that.
( laughs )

27:53.773 --> 27:56.907
Reedus:
<i>Key west has always drawn</i>
<i>outsiders and artists.</i>

27:56.909 --> 28:00.344
<i>Hemingway,</i>
<i>tennessee williams,</i>
<i>truman capote--</i>

28:03.448 --> 28:05.282
<i>I'm excited to learn</i>
<i>about the history</i>

28:05.284 --> 28:06.950
<i>And the influences</i>
<i>about this place</i>

28:06.952 --> 28:10.154
<i>That's inspired</i>
<i>so many people I admire.</i>

28:10.156 --> 28:12.356
Let's go check out
this cigar factory
right here.

28:12.358 --> 28:15.959
Fonda:
<i>It's open.</i>

28:15.961 --> 28:17.995
Reedus:
<i>And being only 90 miles</i>
<i>from cuba,</i>

28:17.997 --> 28:20.964
<i>A cigar shop seemed like</i>
<i>the perfect place to start.</i>

28:20.966 --> 28:23.133
- <i>Hi. How are you? </i>
<i>- Man:</i> <i>Good evening.</i>

28:23.135 --> 28:25.903
- I'm peter, this is norman.
- Nice to meet you. Hi.

28:25.905 --> 28:27.805
It smells great in here.

28:30.842 --> 28:32.943
- <i>How you doing? Danny. </i>
<i>-</i> <i>How are you, sir? Norman.</i>

28:32.945 --> 28:35.279
- Peter.
- Pleasure to meet you.
Welcome to rodriguez cigars.

28:35.281 --> 28:36.947
What's going on
right here?

28:36.949 --> 28:39.917
These are cigars
that we have pressed
this morning.

28:45.090 --> 28:46.857
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, that is slick.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.392
Is this a family business?

28:48.394 --> 28:51.729
<i>Yeah, my grandfather</i>
<i>began in this industry</i>

28:51.731 --> 28:54.098
<i>In central cuba in 1947.</i>

28:54.100 --> 28:57.201
And we're currently
the oldest cigar company
in the florida keys.

28:57.203 --> 29:01.438
- Yes, that's
the man right there.
- Oh, that's cool.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.273
And this is my grandmother
back in here.

29:03.275 --> 29:04.508
- Hi. How are you?
- <i>Hi.</i>

29:04.510 --> 29:06.276
She comes on in
from time to time

29:06.278 --> 29:07.978
To make sure that
I'm doing a good job.

29:07.980 --> 29:09.813
She's adorable.

29:09.815 --> 29:11.882
Fonda:
<i>See how she's so precise</i>
<i>with it, norman?</i>

29:11.884 --> 29:14.151
- She's definitely an artist.
- <i>She has the finger touch.</i>

29:14.153 --> 29:16.286
( speaks spanish )

29:16.288 --> 29:18.155
Come on over here.

29:22.961 --> 29:25.295
Now work your way
on the leaf.

29:25.297 --> 29:28.031
<i>There you go.</i>

29:28.033 --> 29:30.367
Reedus:
<i>This is twice</i>
<i>today that we've--</i>

29:30.369 --> 29:32.202
<i>We met a motorcycle builder</i>
<i>earlier</i>

29:32.204 --> 29:36.406
That makes unique,
one-of-a-kind motorcycles.

29:36.408 --> 29:39.443
And now every cigar
is a unique one-of-a-kind
cigar, really.

29:39.445 --> 29:41.845
Danny:
<i>It's an art.</i>
<i>It is craftsmanship.</i>

29:41.847 --> 29:43.313
Yeah, this is not as easy
as you'd think.

29:45.316 --> 29:47.851
I like all these
old tools and stuff.

29:47.853 --> 29:49.987
Now with that,
we're still not done.

29:49.989 --> 29:52.422
Those cigars need to sit
for approximately a year.

29:52.424 --> 29:55.425
- All right,
we'll be back in a year.
- ( laughs )

29:57.929 --> 30:00.330
- That's nice.
- Danny: <i>Take care of</i>
<i> yourselves, gentlemen.</i>

30:00.332 --> 30:03.066
It was a pleasure.
You're lovely.

30:03.068 --> 30:04.434
She's so sweet.

30:04.969 --> 30:06.303
Pleasure to meet you.

30:06.538 --> 30:09.473
- Bye.
- Num, num.

30:09.475 --> 30:10.374
Let's go this way, man.

30:10.376 --> 30:14.344
This area, has it always
been the cool, hip--

30:14.346 --> 30:16.413
All the time, yeah.

30:16.415 --> 30:20.050
"walking dead," whoo!
Oh, my god!

30:20.052 --> 30:23.353
How are you, man?
Nice to meet you, man.

30:23.355 --> 30:27.291
Oh, my god!
It's daryl from
"the walking dead."

30:27.293 --> 30:29.893
- <i>I'm not ( bleep )</i>
kidding you.
- ( laughs )

30:29.895 --> 30:31.461
Whoo, I love it.

30:31.463 --> 30:33.397
- Daryl!
- Yeah, hey.
What's happening?

30:33.399 --> 30:36.266
How are you, man?
Nice to meet you.

30:36.268 --> 30:38.035
Thank you so much
for the work that you do.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.369
I love it.

30:40.939 --> 30:43.207
- You're really awesome.
- You're awesome.

30:43.209 --> 30:44.908
- Man: I'm a big fan.
- Woman: I want a big hug.

30:44.910 --> 30:47.010
- Yeah, of course.
- ( laughing )

30:47.012 --> 30:49.513
- Why is it so foggy?
- I don't know.
I think it's--

30:49.515 --> 30:51.181
Get in here.

30:51.183 --> 30:52.583
- Thank you, baby.
- You're welcome.

30:52.585 --> 30:54.451
I like photobombing.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.253
I kind of love you.
Not in a weird way.

30:56.255 --> 30:58.488
Norman.
That's peter over there.
Say hi to peter.

30:58.490 --> 31:01.325
- Can we all get a picture?
- Yeah, get over here.

31:01.327 --> 31:02.993
All right I...

31:02.995 --> 31:05.095
- <i>Daryl, we love you. </i>
<i>- I love you, too.</i>

31:05.097 --> 31:07.331
- He looks really confused.
- I know.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.399
Reedus:
<i>Yeah, that just happened.</i>

31:09.401 --> 31:11.635
<i>At least he got a good</i>
<i>photo of himself.</i>

31:11.637 --> 31:13.237
That was hysterical.

31:13.239 --> 31:16.139
I lived on a place
called von phister street.

31:16.141 --> 31:18.108
And tennessee williams,
he was a hell of a writer.

31:18.110 --> 31:19.643
- Great plays.
- Of course. Yeah.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.278
We went over
to tennessee's house,

31:21.280 --> 31:26.016
Me and my ex-wife becky,
a couple of times.

31:26.018 --> 31:28.018
Tennessee was very
proud of the fact

31:28.020 --> 31:31.355
That he rolled joints,
opium inside the marijuana.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.290
That was my first
opium joint.

31:33.292 --> 31:35.959
Opium-marijuana joint
rolled by tennessee williams?

31:35.961 --> 31:38.362
- Yeah, how about that.
- ( imitates gunshot )
that's crazy.

31:38.364 --> 31:40.297
- Isn't that neat?
- That's crazy.

31:40.299 --> 31:42.432
And he was very cool
and very nice.

31:42.434 --> 31:45.068
What happened
after you smoked
the opium-marijuana joint?

31:45.070 --> 31:47.971
- Do you remember?
- I remember that we got
back to our house.

31:47.973 --> 31:51.041
- But I'm not sure how.
- ( laughs )

31:51.043 --> 31:52.643
I think we didn't come
by bicycle.

31:52.645 --> 31:55.045
We left the bicycles
at tennessee's place.

31:55.047 --> 31:57.314
I think I would
have just saved
the joint forever.

31:57.316 --> 31:59.483
Let me get your photo
right here next to this thing.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.218
Hold on one second.

32:01.220 --> 32:04.655
I mean, does this get
any better than this?

32:04.657 --> 32:06.323
( laughs )

32:06.325 --> 32:09.259
Yeah.
Too good. Too good.

32:14.065 --> 32:16.066
How'd you get hooked up
with peter ( bleep ) fonda?

32:16.068 --> 32:17.634
Where's my shot of tequila?

32:17.636 --> 32:19.503
- I wonder if
this is illegal?
- I hope it is.

32:19.505 --> 32:22.639
There's a billion dead
bugs stuck in my blood.

32:23.975 --> 32:27.077
- Oh, man, roosters.
-  <i>Chickens and roosters,</i>
<i> oh, my.</i>

32:27.079 --> 32:29.079
They used to be in cuba,
then they flew the coop.

32:29.081 --> 32:30.647
You do not want
to ( bleep ) with them.

32:30.649 --> 32:32.616
- Yo, don't hit a chicken.
- Don't you dare.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.618
<i>They will tear</i>
<i>your bike apart.</i>

32:34.620 --> 32:38.188
Those ( bleep ) have teeth
and lips and they are mean.

32:38.190 --> 32:41.224
( kissing )
come here, chicken.

32:41.226 --> 32:43.160
Hi, little chicken.

32:43.594 --> 32:46.430
Hi, little
florida chicken.

32:46.432 --> 32:48.699
Hey. Hey.

32:48.701 --> 32:52.336
What's your name?
( kissing )

32:52.338 --> 32:54.538
Come here.

32:54.540 --> 32:56.273
( laughs )

32:56.275 --> 32:57.975
( clucking )

32:57.977 --> 33:00.210
Oh, why'd the chicken
cross the road?

33:00.212 --> 33:01.278
Hey.

33:04.449 --> 33:07.150
Fine, be that way.

33:07.152 --> 33:08.485
Jerk.

33:18.130 --> 33:22.032
Reedus:
<i>Last night, now that</i>
<i>was a great time.</i>

33:22.034 --> 33:23.667
<i>Today, not so much.</i>

33:23.669 --> 33:26.003
<i>But I couldn't not go out</i>
<i>with peter fonda.</i>

33:26.005 --> 33:29.106
<i>I mean, come on, the guy</i>
<i>only knows one way to live.</i>

33:29.108 --> 33:32.275
<i>So today we're gonna go ahead</i>
<i>and skip breakfast</i>

33:32.277 --> 33:33.443
<i>And go straight to lunch.</i>

33:33.445 --> 33:37.314
- Hogfish sandwich
is our specialty.
- It's great.

33:37.316 --> 33:41.018
- Can I have
an ice tea as well?
- And a shot of tequila.

33:41.020 --> 33:44.021
- <i>Absolutely. </i>
<i>- Whoa.</i>

33:44.023 --> 33:45.555
Reedus:
<i>I didn't even know</i>
<i>there was a hogfish.</i>

33:45.557 --> 33:48.291
Fonda:
<i>This is very key west.</i>

33:48.293 --> 33:51.061
Key west
has its own flavor
unlike any other.

33:51.063 --> 33:53.330
- Well, this is known
as the conch republic.
- Why?

33:53.332 --> 33:56.133
Because they didn't have
the seven mile bridge

33:56.135 --> 33:58.035
In the 17 and 1800s.

33:58.037 --> 34:00.037
- You had to go by boat.
- Oh, wow.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.339
The currys and the bruces
which ran the island--

34:02.341 --> 34:05.042
Two families, they wanted
to be their own country.

34:05.044 --> 34:07.177
They were running cigarettes,
rum, and everything else.

34:07.179 --> 34:08.578
A bunch of pirates
down here.

34:08.580 --> 34:11.214
This is why my friend,
who we'll meet--

34:11.216 --> 34:13.216
- Dink?
- Benjamin curry bruce.

34:13.218 --> 34:15.218
Oh, he's one
of the two families.

34:15.220 --> 34:17.754
Yeah, he's the progeny
of both families
coming together.

34:17.756 --> 34:19.189
Two killer
hogfish sandwiches.

34:19.191 --> 34:21.324
- All right. Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

34:21.326 --> 34:23.360
Look at this thing.
That's insane.

34:23.362 --> 34:25.228
I can't even fit
this in my mouth.
This is nuts.

34:27.098 --> 34:28.799
See?

34:28.801 --> 34:30.600
That's delicious.

34:33.671 --> 34:35.672
What was your time
like here in key west?

34:35.674 --> 34:37.574
I bet you could pretty much
do anything back then.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.242
From what we witnessed
last night,

34:39.244 --> 34:42.312
I still think we can do
practically anything.

34:42.314 --> 34:44.414
Yeah, all those crazy people
jumping out of bars and stuff.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.716
- All calling you daryl.
- Yeah, yeah.

34:46.718 --> 34:50.620
- His name is norman reedus.
- My relatives are calling
me daryl now.

34:50.622 --> 34:52.756
Where's my shot
of tequila?

34:54.792 --> 34:56.760
No respect anymore.

34:57.261 --> 35:00.163
A fool.
A florida fool.

35:00.165 --> 35:03.633
How's it going?
Where you guys headed?

35:03.635 --> 35:06.136
Fonda:
<i>Best answer.</i>

35:06.138 --> 35:07.504
- Woman: <i>How you doing? </i>
<i>- Reedus:</i> <i>Hi.</i>

35:07.506 --> 35:09.306
How did you get hooked
up with peter fonda?

35:09.308 --> 35:11.575
- I know, right?
- It's peter ( bleep ) fonda.

35:11.577 --> 35:14.744
I saw him first,
and then I was like,
"oh, that's norman."

35:14.746 --> 35:18.281
We're, like, traveling
around florida and just meeting
people and hearing stories.

35:18.283 --> 35:19.816
- Nice.
- It's fun.

This is beautiful.
Look at that big cruiser

<i>And his family's roots</i>

36:28.320 --> 36:31.755
Peter was telling me
about that you were the two
originating families down here.

36:31.757 --> 36:35.625
Since before the 1800s.
A lot of history
in key west.

36:35.627 --> 36:38.328
- A lot of, you know.
- When was the last time
you guys hung out?

36:38.330 --> 36:41.464
Montana.
A few years ago, though.

36:41.466 --> 36:43.767
There was a spot you used
to tell me you used to go
and fly kites from.

36:43.769 --> 36:46.770
This is it.
I'd come out here
with my stepson,

36:46.772 --> 36:49.506
Thomas, fishing
and flying kites.

36:49.508 --> 36:51.208
Absolutely.

36:54.412 --> 36:58.582
<i>Thomas and I were</i>
<i>only flying old-time</i>
<i>fashioned paper kites.</i>

36:58.584 --> 37:01.818
But it was fun.
I mean, he loved
coming out.

37:03.955 --> 37:06.623
Reedus:
<i>For peter, this place</i>
<i>is a reminder</i>

37:06.625 --> 37:08.892
<i>Of a time when his kids</i>
<i>were just kids</i>

37:08.894 --> 37:12.229
<i>And a place where he wasn't</i>
<i>a counterculture rebel,</i>

37:12.231 --> 37:13.897
<i>But simply a dad.</i>

37:13.899 --> 37:16.233
<i>And that's something</i>
<i>I can relate to.</i>

37:16.235 --> 37:19.469
<i>It's a constant struggle</i>
<i>to find a balance that works.</i>

37:19.471 --> 37:21.571
<i>Today or back</i>
<i>when peter was my age,</i>

37:21.573 --> 37:23.740
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

37:23.742 --> 37:26.643
<i>Back then, I imagine,</i>
<i>he looked just as cool</i>
<i>with a kite in the sky</i>

37:26.645 --> 37:29.379
<i>As he did with his hand</i>
<i>on the throttle.</i>

<i>Coming back here</i>
<i>40 years later,</i>

37:31.617 --> 37:35.919
<i>Only a lifelong friend</i>

<i>what to bring.</i>

37:35.921 --> 37:38.722
Dink: <i>You know,</i>
<i>there's a law that you can't</i>
<i>put them up too high</i>

37:38.724 --> 37:40.390
<i>Because the airport's</i>

37:50.701 --> 37:53.670
- You fish off this pier?
- There's bait here in that bag.

37:53.672 --> 37:57.307
Oh, there is?
I've never fished
with a squid.

37:57.309 --> 38:00.810
Uh. Back up.
I'm slinging squid.

38:00.812 --> 38:02.679
- <i>You get over there. </i>
<i>-</i> <i>The birds are looking at it.</i>

38:02.681 --> 38:04.681
The birds are
after my squid.
Want to join me?

38:04.683 --> 38:06.516
All right.

38:06.518 --> 38:09.953
- The old men
of the sea here.
- Yeah, right?

38:09.955 --> 38:11.621
- Fonda:
Let's go get a drink.
- Dink: Okay.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.890
Reedus:
Dink, let's get a drink.

38:13.892 --> 38:17.027

- You got it.
- <i>Thank you.</i>

38:39.051 --> 38:43.687
Matusalem rum

and ginger ale.

38:43.689 --> 38:46.456

38:46.458 --> 38:48.058
You have your own

38:48.060 --> 38:52.062

made it down here.
- Here we are.

39:04.343 --> 39:07.077
- Yeah, it was a beautiful ride.
- The end of the ride here
in cayo hueso.

39:07.079 --> 39:09.112
To cayo hueso.

39:09.114 --> 39:12.415
Dink's known me
for forever.

39:12.417 --> 39:14.050
<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>I came in in '74...</i>

39:14.052 --> 39:16.353
With two cats
and a girlfriend.

39:16.355 --> 39:18.388
...With two cats
and a girlfriend

39:18.390 --> 39:22.359
And that silver
bmw 3.0 cs.

39:22.361 --> 39:25.795
- Yeah, I liked that.
- How has it changed,
this area?

39:25.797 --> 39:27.897
It wasn't so many people.

39:27.899 --> 39:30.967
You could see all
the old conch houses,
and they were great.

39:30.969 --> 39:34.871
There was no traffic then,
and bicycling was really
the way to go.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.907
- It was hysterical.
- What got you into
motorcycles to begin with?

39:37.909 --> 39:41.478
Well, I liked the idea,
and knew it would really
freak my father out.

39:41.480 --> 39:45.148
Oh, really?
Was your dad, like,
just totally against it?

39:45.150 --> 39:47.617
Well, yeah, but once
I was 21, screw it.

39:47.619 --> 39:49.619
Yeah, yeah.

39:49.621 --> 39:52.722
But, you know what?
Since then, I've enjoyed--

39:52.724 --> 39:56.493
I've ridden a lot
off highways.

39:56.495 --> 39:58.995
- You know, just cruising.
- It's great.

39:58.997 --> 40:03.032
Bugs everywhere
eating up the leather.
I loved it.

40:03.034 --> 40:05.034
Reedus:
<i>I have a road</i>
<i>like that in georgia.</i>

40:05.036 --> 40:08.505
When I'm done on set,
there's one road,

40:08.507 --> 40:11.574
It's a perfect
tunnel of trees.

40:11.576 --> 40:13.843
And the light
is so perfect
through there.

40:13.845 --> 40:15.745
And the temperature
changes

40:15.747 --> 40:17.914
To a perfect temperature
as soon as you enter it.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.817
It's like it's a magical,
magical road.

40:20.819 --> 40:24.654
I'll have blood all over my--
like, fake blood all over
my hands and arms

40:24.656 --> 40:27.924
And my neck
and everything else,
and I'll be riding like that,

40:27.926 --> 40:29.793
And by the time
I get to my house,

40:29.795 --> 40:33.463
There's a billion dead bugs,
like, stuck all in my blood.

40:33.465 --> 40:36.199
- It's disgusting.
- ( laughing )

40:36.201 --> 40:37.834
Yeah.

40:37.836 --> 40:40.069
I really like riding
with a partner.

40:40.071 --> 40:42.672
I like the rumble and then
the following rumble.

40:42.674 --> 40:44.874
I like the rumble
around me, you know?

40:44.876 --> 40:47.677
- I think it's nice.
- Yeah, absolutely right.

40:47.679 --> 40:52.182
And, you know,
going over the seven
mile bridge,

40:52.184 --> 40:55.218
I mean, the sun was right
in my face, setting.

40:55.220 --> 40:57.754
- Fonda: <i>Oh, it was beautiful. </i>
<i>-</i> <i>It was so pretty.</i>

40:57.756 --> 41:01.157
<i>But sometimes, like, a giant</i>
<i>truck would fly by,</i>

41:01.159 --> 41:04.727
<i>And it would wake me up,</i>
<i>'cause I was just so lost</i>

41:04.729 --> 41:07.597
<i>Looking around at</i>
<i>the ocean and the sunset</i>

41:07.599 --> 41:09.666
<i>And the breeze</i>
<i>going through me.</i>

41:09.668 --> 41:12.202
<i>You know?</i>
<i>Like, the breeze</i>
<i>and the smell</i>

41:12.204 --> 41:15.138
<i>And the ocean air</i>
<i>down here is just magical.</i>

41:17.908 --> 41:20.176
If you're riding in traffic,
you don't get that shot.

41:20.178 --> 41:24.814
You're actually out in the air
and you're not in a cage.

41:24.816 --> 41:27.684
<i>So relaxed.</i>
<i>I love riding.</i>

41:27.686 --> 41:31.120
'cause it forces focus,
and I need that.

41:31.122 --> 41:35.158
- Right.
- And once you get into
that thing of focus,

41:35.160 --> 41:38.895
And you get easy with it,
then you can actually
look around

41:38.897 --> 41:41.197
- And see what there is.
- Yeah. Yeah.

41:43.033 --> 41:45.602
Reedus:
<i>You know, it's crazy</i>
<i>how some things work out.</i>

41:45.604 --> 41:48.805
<i>Growing up, I wanted to be</i>
<i>peter fonda in "easy rider,"</i>

41:48.807 --> 41:51.207
<i>And these last few days,</i>
<i>I got the next best thing.</i>

41:51.209 --> 41:53.543
Reedus:
<i>I don't think I've ever</i>
<i>met anyone</i>

41:53.545 --> 41:56.613
That, like, the whole motto
of "live free and ride fast"

41:56.615 --> 41:57.981
Fits better than you.

41:57.983 --> 42:01.251
I mean, like, it's like
it was coined for you.

42:01.253 --> 42:03.520
- Fonda:
<i>Ride hard or stay home. </i>
<i>- Reedus:</i> <i>Yup.</i>

42:03.522 --> 42:05.822
<i>It's been such a joy you</i>
<i>showing me your key west,</i>

42:05.824 --> 42:08.591
- <i>Thank you for doing this. </i>
<i>- Fonda:</i> <i>Oh, hey, no.</i>

42:08.593 --> 42:10.059
It's been great for me.

42:12.796 --> 42:15.265
<i>( music playing )</i>

42:20.704 --> 42:23.907
I like florida.
I get why a lot of people
come here and retire.

42:23.909 --> 42:26.276
Retirement to me
is a dirty word.

42:26.278 --> 42:29.045
( laughs )
I want your life, peter.

42:29.047 --> 42:32.315
Reedus:
<i>They say you shouldn't spend</i>
<i>too much time with your heroes.</i>

42:32.317 --> 42:34.183
<i>I guess I lucked out.</i>

42:34.185 --> 42:37.554
Peter fonda is cooler in person
<i>than I ever wanted him to be</i>

42:37.556 --> 42:39.989
<i>And one hell of a co-rider.</i>

42:39.991 --> 42:43.226
<i>Life is a journey.</i>
<i>It's not about where</i>
<i>you end up.</i>

42:43.228 --> 42:46.195
<i>It's how you get there</i>
<i>and who you choose</i>
<i>to ride with.</i>

42:46.197 --> 42:50.300
<i>That's what riding with</i>
<i>peter fonda has taught me.</i>

42:50.302 --> 42:52.569
<i>And the best part</i>
<i>of riding to key west</i>

42:52.571 --> 42:55.138
<i>Is that, well,</i>
<i>there's only one way out.</i>
