00:01.914 --> 00:03.873
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...There's gonna be
an article in the

00:03.916 --> 00:06.745
-<i>L.A. Times</i> coming out tomorrow.
- Mayor's gonna have
your head for this.

00:06.789 --> 00:09.922
You're being demoted
from 20-Squad leader. <i>There have een rumors</i>

00:09.966 --> 00:12.708
- 20-Squad might not be reforming.
- What's Hondo got to say
about this?

00:12.751 --> 00:14.797
<i>Hondo's gone, man.
Rumor is he's in Mexico,</i>

00:14.840 --> 00:17.017
<i>but nobody from SWAT's
heard from him.</i>

00:17.060 --> 00:18.235
You can help my
mother and me.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.023
Why don't you
just leave that family alone.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.502
<i>That way, I can go back</i>

00:24.546 --> 00:26.069
-<i>nothing.
This time tomorrow,</i>

00:26.113 --> 00:27.418
you and I could be
on different teams.

00:27.462 --> 00:28.767
<i>And I'm done</i>

00:30.769 --> 00:32.162
for each other.

00:32.206 --> 00:33.859
It's probably our last ride.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.252
<i>Soon as we get
the new assignments,</i>

00:35.296 --> 00:37.124
- I'm asking you out. Deal?
- Deal.

00:37.167 --> 00:39.778
You run the show until this team
leader mess gets sorted out.

00:39.822 --> 00:40.953
There's nothing to sort out.

00:40.997 --> 00:42.085
<i>Hicks is gonna split us up</i>

00:42.129 --> 00:43.782
<i>and put us on different squads.</i>

00:43.826 --> 00:45.958
Hondo's gone, 20-Squad's done.

00:46.002 --> 00:48.396
What kills me, he's gonna come
- back, his team will be gone.
<i>You're leaving?</i>

00:48.439 --> 00:50.050
<i>I got what I needed.
- You never told me</i>

00:50.093 --> 00:52.313
- what you do back home.
- I help people.

00:52.356 --> 00:54.184
<i>There's no 20-Squad
without Hondo.</i>

00:56.491 --> 00:59.363
- It's time to get back to work.
- Yeah, baby.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.583
How's my team?

01:07.980 --> 01:09.895
Here you go.

01:11.027 --> 01:12.507
Thanks, Pop.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.468
So,

01:17.512 --> 01:20.428
first day back to school.
All right,

01:20.471 --> 01:22.125
whatever criticism
you got stuck in your throat,

01:22.169 --> 01:24.345
go ahead
and spit it out already.

01:24.388 --> 01:26.738
I just can't believe
that you walking back

01:26.782 --> 01:28.653
into that same damn building,

01:28.697 --> 01:31.700
playing good
little soldier

01:31.743 --> 01:34.355
after the way the LAPD
disrespected you like that.

01:34.398 --> 01:36.705
I don't disagree.

01:36.748 --> 01:38.315
Then why you doing it, then?

01:38.359 --> 01:42.102
I had a lot of time in Mexico
to try to figure that out.

01:42.145 --> 01:44.016
Oh. Well,
you want to clue me in, then?

01:44.060 --> 01:46.018
I still think
I can do good, Pop.

01:46.062 --> 01:47.281
I can still make a change.

01:47.324 --> 01:49.152
Oh, yeah, you can
make a change.

01:49.196 --> 01:51.894
You made so much of a change
that they demoted your ass

01:51.937 --> 01:54.026
for doing the right thing.

01:54.070 --> 01:56.072
You know,

01:56.116 --> 01:57.160
if it was me,
you know what I'd be saying

01:57.204 --> 01:58.466
to them bosses of yours?

01:58.509 --> 02:00.990
I got a pretty good idea,
Pop. Look...

02:03.558 --> 02:05.560
I can't be late for class.

02:08.606 --> 02:10.130
Hey, son.

02:12.175 --> 02:13.872
They don't deserve you.

02:13.916 --> 02:16.048
I want you to promise
me one thing.

02:16.092 --> 02:18.094
Just one thing.

02:18.921 --> 02:20.227
What's that?

02:20.270 --> 02:22.707
If they try to take
your dignity from you

02:22.751 --> 02:24.448
that you walk away.

02:24.492 --> 02:26.407
For good.

02:27.930 --> 02:30.150
No doubt.

02:31.412 --> 02:32.848
I love you, Pop.

02:32.891 --> 02:34.937
I love you, too, son.

02:40.986 --> 02:43.293
This is weird, right? Us all
getting called in like this?

02:43.337 --> 02:45.774
I'm telling you,
they got to be putting 20-Squad

02:45.817 --> 02:47.036
back together again.

02:47.079 --> 02:49.517
If that's true,
who's running the show?

02:49.560 --> 02:51.997
No way the suits downtown
changed their minds on Hondo.

02:52.041 --> 02:55.479
- So Deacon, then.
- Deac already turned
it down. Tan.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.525
- What are you hearing?
- Officially? Nothing.

02:57.568 --> 02:59.353
But I just finished a shift
with 50-Squad.

02:59.396 --> 03:00.876
Rocker stuck his head
in the locker room,

03:00.919 --> 03:03.052
called me a defector.
Dude, no question.

03:03.095 --> 03:06.577
- 20-Squad is back in the saddle.
- Know soon enough.

03:06.621 --> 03:09.363
I just saw Hondo and Deac
headed up to Hicks's office.

03:12.409 --> 03:15.195
[door closes]20-Squad's been reinstated.

03:17.545 --> 03:20.417
I thought that would get
more of a reaction from you two.

03:20.461 --> 03:23.333
- That's not all, though.
- Who's team leader?

03:24.682 --> 03:26.031
You always

03:26.075 --> 03:27.598
got to watch your six, fellas.

03:27.642 --> 03:29.121
You never know

03:29.165 --> 03:30.819
who might be lurking
- in the shadows.
- Sanchez.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.081
How are you?

03:32.124 --> 03:33.604
Whose idea was it
to ambush us?

03:33.648 --> 03:35.780
- Who do you think?
God, you two are a sight.

03:35.824 --> 03:38.522
Although, Deac, a little more
salt, lot less pepper

03:38.566 --> 03:40.611
- last time I saw you.
- What are you even doing here?

03:40.655 --> 03:43.135
I figured you left SWAT in
your rearview a long time ago.

03:43.179 --> 03:45.355
I did. I've been climbing
my way up the department.

03:45.399 --> 03:47.270
All the way
- to the mayor's detail.
- Oh, I got stories

03:47.314 --> 03:48.619
for you, believe me.

03:48.663 --> 03:50.099
None of them compare

03:50.142 --> 03:52.275
to my SWAT days.
So, when I heard there was

03:52.319 --> 03:55.017
a team leader slot open,
in 20-Squad, no less,

03:55.060 --> 03:57.541
I figured you <i>can</i> go home again.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.064
Sanchez comes to us
with the commission's

03:59.108 --> 04:00.588
full seal of approval.

04:00.631 --> 04:02.894
For what that's worth.
But I guess the commission's

04:02.938 --> 04:04.592
gonna shove some jackass
down your throat.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.637
- Yeah, why not this jackass?
- My thoughts exactly.

04:06.681 --> 04:08.639
- Let's get 20-Squad
up and running ASAP.

04:08.683 --> 04:11.076
Take Sanchez down,
inform the rest of them.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.643
We'll circle back if
there's any other details

04:12.687 --> 04:14.515
- we need to work out.
- Appreciate it, Commander.

04:14.558 --> 04:15.994
Yep.

04:19.868 --> 04:22.131
Hey, Deac, hold up a sec.

04:24.176 --> 04:25.961
Hondo, if it's
all the same,

04:26.004 --> 04:28.355
I'd like to make the intros
to the young guns myself.

04:28.398 --> 04:29.965
You're there, they're
gonna be more focused

04:30.008 --> 04:32.489
on trying to read you
than listening to me.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.926
Sure. Makes sense.

04:34.970 --> 04:36.319
Welcome aboard.

04:36.363 --> 04:37.886
Thank you.

04:42.369 --> 04:43.587
You good with this?

04:43.631 --> 04:45.807
It is what it is.

04:45.850 --> 04:48.375
I'm just surprised
you didn't take the job.

04:48.418 --> 04:52.074
Look, I-I wanted
Durham and his racist pals

04:52.117 --> 04:53.815
out of here as much as you.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.991
It's just what you did
got you demoted,

04:56.034 --> 04:58.472
and didn't feel right
coming out of all that

04:58.515 --> 04:59.821
and taking your spot.

04:59.864 --> 05:01.301
Not without talking to you.

05:01.344 --> 05:03.999
- Means a lot, Deac.
- Course, you'd know all that

05:04.042 --> 05:06.523
if you'd answer your phone
or any of the texts I sent

05:06.567 --> 05:07.916
- while you were gone.
- I know.

05:07.959 --> 05:10.222
- And I am sorry.
- It's okay.

05:10.266 --> 05:11.746
I get it.

05:11.789 --> 05:13.704
We're good.

05:13.748 --> 05:16.011
Yeah.

05:20.276 --> 05:22.322
Rocker wasn't easy on me
at first,

05:22.365 --> 05:23.801
but the team was
growing on me.

05:23.845 --> 05:26.456
- You having second thoughts?
- Nah, no way.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.893
If 20-Squad's back together,
I'm all in, for sure.

05:28.937 --> 05:30.982
Just who I was looking for.

05:31.026 --> 05:32.506
Street, right?

05:32.549 --> 05:35.378
Not looking too bad just
coming off major surgery.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.206
And, Tan, dude,
I got a buddy in Vice

05:37.249 --> 05:39.295
who raves about you.
Alonso, I hear

05:39.339 --> 05:41.210
you're the best sniper in SWAT.

05:41.253 --> 05:44.866
I'm your new 20-David,
Rodrigo Sanchez.

05:44.909 --> 05:46.868
I'm SWAT OG
from before your time,

05:46.911 --> 05:48.783
but I worked with Hondo,
Deacon, Luca.

05:48.826 --> 05:50.437
They were all my brothers.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.178
I look forward
to making you family, too.

05:53.962 --> 05:55.790
Well, good to meet you.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.835
It's great to have
- the team back.
- Soon as you're readied up,

05:57.879 --> 06:00.360
- let's all meet outside, yeah?
- Yeah.

06:02.187 --> 06:04.015
He's 20-David now?

06:04.059 --> 06:05.408
I hadn't thought about that.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.192
What's that make Hondo?

06:07.236 --> 06:09.891
It'd make him
27-David, I guess.

06:09.934 --> 06:11.588
- That doesn't sound right.
Yeah, well,

06:11.632 --> 06:13.851
sounds like we're gonna have
to get used to a lot of things.

06:44.142 --> 06:47.363
Everything all right?
- Can't be parked here.
Um, it's...

06:47.407 --> 06:50.018
My-my stupid truck, it just...
- It died.
- I don't mean

06:50.061 --> 06:52.412
to be a hard-ass, but it has
to move. Need me to call a tow?

06:52.455 --> 06:53.761
Oh, no. That's so sweet,

06:53.804 --> 06:55.676
but, um, I'm waiting
for my boyfriend. He has

06:55.719 --> 06:57.591
the magic touch,
so he'll fix it.

06:57.634 --> 06:59.375
All right.
I'll check back my next pass,

06:59.419 --> 07:01.333
- see how you're doing.
- Okay. Thank you.

07:01.377 --> 07:02.813
Yeah.

07:08.515 --> 07:10.255
Step out of the car. Now.

07:15.783 --> 07:17.306
Go. Go.

07:17.349 --> 07:18.612
What about Dale?

07:18.655 --> 07:19.743
Just go!

07:39.459 --> 07:40.982
This is Riley.
We have a man with a gun

07:41.025 --> 07:44.072
at Elite Wire and Cable.
Shots have been fired.

07:47.641 --> 07:49.033
Yeah,
I guess the rumors are true.

07:49.077 --> 07:50.252
I'm back, baby.

07:50.295 --> 07:51.471
Don't worry, we'll catch up

07:51.514 --> 07:53.081
- on the way there.
- That's Hondo's seat.

07:55.257 --> 07:57.955
This ain't kindergarten.
Don't need assigned spots.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.348
You sure?

08:00.175 --> 08:02.351
It's all good. Take it.

08:05.006 --> 08:07.487
<i>20-Squad on scene.
Barricade situation</i>

08:07.530 --> 08:09.184
<i>at Elite Wire and Cable.</i>

08:13.580 --> 08:16.060
All right, listen up. Go in

08:16.104 --> 08:17.192
straight stack on me.

08:17.235 --> 08:18.541
And they got a shooter inside,

08:18.585 --> 08:20.195
so let's be smart.
Don't need nobody

08:20.238 --> 08:21.675
trying to impress
the new boss.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.720
Let's play it straight and safe,
all go home happy.

08:23.764 --> 08:25.287
Luca, you with me?

08:25.330 --> 08:26.941
Absolutely, 100%.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.508
Good. Hondo,
anything you want to add?

08:30.118 --> 08:32.033
- Stay liquid.
Hell yeah, man.

08:32.076 --> 08:33.513
- That's it.
- Let's move.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.222
This is the LAPD.

08:47.265 --> 08:49.050
The building's surrounded.
You're outgunned,

08:49.093 --> 08:50.704
outnumbered. Be smart.

08:50.747 --> 08:53.184
Put your gun down and come out
with your hands in the air.

08:55.186 --> 08:57.406
20-David. No response
from the suspect.

08:57.449 --> 08:58.886
Making an entry.

08:58.929 --> 09:00.931
Got it.

09:04.456 --> 09:05.457
Move.

09:23.650 --> 09:26.217
Luca. Alonso.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.835
24-David. We got

09:34.878 --> 09:36.097
a security guard tied up.

09:36.140 --> 09:37.533
No sign of the suspect.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.275
Did you see which
way he went?

09:40.318 --> 09:42.059
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

09:44.235 --> 09:46.542
Let's get you out of here.

09:50.372 --> 09:52.940
24-David. Headed out
with the security guard

09:52.983 --> 09:54.594
to the exit.

10:17.138 --> 10:20.532
27-David. South aisle is clear.
No sign of him.

10:20.576 --> 10:21.577
30-David.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.883
Same on the north.

10:22.926 --> 10:25.059
- Think we missed him?
- That or he was gone

10:25.102 --> 10:27.452
before patrol
secured a perimeter.

10:28.453 --> 10:30.194
Street, tac lights.

10:44.339 --> 10:45.383
Hondo.

10:49.605 --> 10:50.432
LAPD!

10:50.475 --> 10:52.564
Show me your hands! Hey! Stop!

10:53.348 --> 10:54.741
27-David.

10:54.784 --> 10:57.352
Suspect is moving fast,
running back to the west.

11:01.225 --> 11:03.140
He's heading for the east exit.

11:05.839 --> 11:07.971
I said stop!

11:18.895 --> 11:20.418
Hell yeah!

11:23.204 --> 11:24.945
Like riding a bike.

11:25.989 --> 11:28.035
Tan, do the honors.

11:28.078 --> 11:30.994
On your stomach,
hands behind your back.

11:33.823 --> 11:35.259
Good job, Sanchez.

12:18.389 --> 12:20.652
Hey, Deac, wait up.
I'm joining you.
Uh, Tan was

12:20.696 --> 12:22.393
- gonna jump in there with me.
- The owner of the factory

12:22.437 --> 12:23.960
that was hit in the heist
earlier is on the way in.

12:24.004 --> 12:26.920
I'm-a have Tan team up
with Chris on that one.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.312
And to be honest?

12:28.356 --> 12:30.793
I just wouldn't mind
taking a run at this guy myself.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.664
You catch them, you
clean them, huh?

12:32.708 --> 12:35.580
- That's right.
- All right. Let's
have at him.

12:38.105 --> 12:40.672
Tough day, Dale, huh?

12:40.716 --> 12:44.633
Not exactly how you saw it
turning out, is it?

12:47.592 --> 12:50.073
- It's okay to speak, you know.
- Yeah, but I don't have to.

12:50.117 --> 12:52.989
And I'm not gonna give up
my friends.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.686
Well, your friends
ditched you this morning.

12:54.730 --> 12:56.210
They didn't give a damn
what happened to you.

12:56.253 --> 12:59.300
I sure hope you're not gonna try
to cover for them now.

12:59.343 --> 13:01.302
You got to be smarter
than that.

13:01.345 --> 13:03.130
They played you, Dale.

13:03.173 --> 13:05.523
They did. They played you.

13:05.567 --> 13:07.308
You're the security systems guy,

13:07.351 --> 13:09.527
and, well, once you got them

13:09.571 --> 13:11.747
past the alarm
into the building...

13:11.791 --> 13:14.315
You see how far
that love went.

13:14.358 --> 13:17.361
Who are they?

13:18.145 --> 13:20.190
- I don't really know their names.
All right.

13:20.234 --> 13:22.845
Then what were they after?
What'd they take?

13:22.889 --> 13:25.848
I don't really know that,
either.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.851
Look, the girl came to me,
just needed me

13:28.895 --> 13:31.767
to kill a security system.
No big thing.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.596
Offered me
a thousand bucks to do it.

13:37.120 --> 13:40.515
Is there anything
you can tell us about them?

13:40.558 --> 13:43.300
Dale, give us
something to work with.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.913
One of the guys,

13:46.956 --> 13:49.219
she called him the Chemist.

13:50.481 --> 13:51.874
Oh, and the-the license plate.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.963
- You got a plate?
- Part of it.

13:54.007 --> 13:58.663
It was "007," which I thought
was kind of cool.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.883
Maybe good luck or something.

14:00.927 --> 14:03.625
Guess you're not as useless
as we thought.

14:09.936 --> 14:12.373
That wasn't as much
fun as I remembered.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.027
Yeah, well,
it's-it's a lot better

14:14.070 --> 14:15.680
when they put up at least
a little bit of a fight.

14:15.724 --> 14:19.119
It's good to be back, though.

14:19.162 --> 14:22.513
So, how's the missus
and, uh, Lila?

14:22.557 --> 14:23.732
Well, they're good.

14:23.775 --> 14:26.604
Um, also, there's Matthew

14:26.648 --> 14:28.737
and Samuel and Victoria.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.173
Holy crap,

14:30.217 --> 14:31.914
Deac. When are you gonna
give poor Annie a break?

14:31.958 --> 14:33.437
How about you?

14:33.481 --> 14:35.570
- You, uh, you still with Brandi?
- Nah, Brandi was one wife

14:35.613 --> 14:37.354
- and two girlfriends ago.
- Ah.

14:37.398 --> 14:39.748
- Sorry.
- It's for the best.

14:39.791 --> 14:41.706
You know, what you said earlier

14:41.750 --> 14:43.970
about me leaving this place
in my rearview...

14:44.013 --> 14:47.060
All the other jobs since,
they haven't come close.

14:47.103 --> 14:50.106
None have ever felt
like a family.

14:52.413 --> 14:53.805
<i>Her name is Annabeth Kyle.</i>

14:53.849 --> 14:55.633
We talked on the phone.
She says she has no idea

14:55.677 --> 14:57.287
what the thieves might have
been after this morning.

14:57.331 --> 14:58.810
- You believe her?
- I don't know.

14:58.854 --> 15:01.552
But at least she was willing
to come down and talk to us.

15:01.596 --> 15:03.728
The guards, the fencing?

15:03.772 --> 15:05.643
That's all
because of trouble we had

15:05.687 --> 15:07.645
with people stealing copper.

15:07.689 --> 15:10.648
But there really wasn't anything
of value in the storeroom.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.259
Certainly not
worth stealing.

15:12.302 --> 15:14.783
Just books, paintings,

15:14.826 --> 15:16.045
pictures.

15:16.089 --> 15:18.526
Old memories
I couldn't bear to throw away.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.658
There must be something.
The crew specifically targeted

15:20.702 --> 15:22.617
that room, and whatever
they took, they were willing

15:22.660 --> 15:24.184
to shoot a man to get it.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.186
That's an inventory
of everything

15:26.229 --> 15:27.317
that was left in the storeroom.

15:27.361 --> 15:29.450
Notice anything missing?

15:29.493 --> 15:32.061
These are all my husband's
old things.

15:32.105 --> 15:35.325
Their value
is really just sentimental.

15:35.369 --> 15:37.153
Jerry passed away
three months ago.

15:37.197 --> 15:38.459
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

15:38.502 --> 15:40.374
Must be tough.

15:42.028 --> 15:43.986
Well, after he died, I...

15:44.030 --> 15:45.553
I couldn't stand
being at home alone,

15:45.596 --> 15:47.033
so I downsized
to a smaller place.

15:47.076 --> 15:49.644
And Jerry's caretaker
at the end, Pipa,

15:49.687 --> 15:51.298
helped me move all his
stuff to the warehouse,

15:51.341 --> 15:53.865
so she might know better.

15:54.605 --> 15:55.955
Hey, wait a minute.

15:55.998 --> 15:59.001
I don't see
his grandfather's drawings.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.699
- What kind of drawings?
- Uh, Jerry's grandfather was

16:01.743 --> 16:04.180
an architect, fairly prominent
back in L.A.'s golden age.

16:04.224 --> 16:05.965
Howard Kyle?

16:06.008 --> 16:09.620
He designed, well,
20-some buildings downtown.

16:09.664 --> 16:11.492
Jerry was always
pretty proud of that.

16:11.535 --> 16:13.233
But as far as value,

16:13.276 --> 16:16.323
the drawings aren't worth
the paper they're printed on.

16:16.366 --> 16:17.585
I just don't understand

16:17.628 --> 16:19.239
why someone
would want them so badly.

16:19.282 --> 16:21.850
Stealing old architectural
drawings and blueprints

16:21.893 --> 16:24.026
makes me think this morning's
crime's gonna lead to another.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.028
See if we can get copies
of what was stolen.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.335
Might help us
piece things together.

16:28.378 --> 16:29.684
Already spoke
to a historian

16:29.727 --> 16:30.990
at the, uh, Building
Preservation Society.

16:31.033 --> 16:32.948
Hand-drawn layouts
from that far back

16:32.992 --> 16:35.255
weren't digitized,
so no copies exist.

16:35.298 --> 16:37.387
According to our guy
in custody,

16:37.431 --> 16:39.781
one of the suspects
from this morning's crew?

16:39.824 --> 16:42.523
He's called the Chemist.
I hate to say it, but... Explosives?

16:42.566 --> 16:44.394
I hate to say it, too.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.396
Alonso, get back
with your contact

16:46.440 --> 16:47.658
at the Preservation Society.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.051
I'm sure they can give you
a list

16:49.095 --> 16:50.835
of the buildings
this Howard Kyle designed.

16:50.879 --> 16:52.620
You and Street figure out
how many are still standing,

16:52.663 --> 16:53.838
which ones might
make good targets.

16:53.882 --> 16:55.318
Meantime, I got Tan working

16:55.362 --> 16:56.972
on a partial plate
of the suspects' pickup truck.

16:57.016 --> 16:58.930
-"007"?
- It's casting
a pretty wide net,

16:58.974 --> 17:00.845
but maybe we get lucky.

17:00.889 --> 17:02.412
I hate relying on luck.

17:08.288 --> 17:09.550
Hey. You got a minute?

17:09.593 --> 17:11.682
Course, Luca. What's up?

17:11.726 --> 17:13.902
Look.

17:17.340 --> 17:18.776
I'm just gonna ask it.

17:18.820 --> 17:20.517
Why are you here, exactly?

17:20.561 --> 17:23.085
What do you mean?
Why are any of us here?

17:23.129 --> 17:24.434
This is SWAT.

17:24.478 --> 17:26.523
This is the brass ring
every cop's reaching for.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.264
Nah, you're not here
for any brass ring

17:28.308 --> 17:31.006
or running and gunning with
your old buds or any of that.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.878
- Okay, what's it about, then?
- Look, I know you.

17:33.922 --> 17:35.402
Always a climber,
a self-promoter.

17:35.445 --> 17:38.100
Always looking to grab
the next rung up the ladder.

17:38.144 --> 17:40.450
Coming back here
is a step down for you.

17:40.494 --> 17:42.061
There's no way
that you'd do that

17:42.104 --> 17:43.975
unless there was something
in it for you.

17:44.019 --> 17:45.629
Hell, you left
the mayor's detail for this.

17:45.673 --> 17:46.891
Why does everyone think
the mayor's detail

17:46.935 --> 17:48.676
is some kind of prime gig?

17:48.719 --> 17:50.286
99% of the time,

17:50.330 --> 17:52.636
you're just waiting in hallways
or restaurant lobbies.

17:52.680 --> 17:55.465
I got bored out
of my skull.

17:55.509 --> 17:56.814
Trust me,

17:56.858 --> 17:58.425
this right here
is the sweet spot.

17:58.468 --> 18:01.036
Now, I may not have known it
when I left six years ago,

18:01.080 --> 18:03.647
but I sure as hell know it now.

18:06.868 --> 18:09.392
All right, we got to jump.
Looks like Tan might have a line

18:09.436 --> 18:11.046
on our suspects.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.877
What'd you find?

18:15.920 --> 18:19.315
Turns out there are ten white
max cab Ford F-150s in L.A.

18:19.359 --> 18:22.057
with "007" in the tag number.
Got a list of the R.O.s.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.493
Anybody stand out
from the crowd?

18:23.537 --> 18:25.016
Nope. All ten
look squeaky-clean.

18:25.060 --> 18:26.801
It's the squeaky-clean ones
you got to look out for.

18:26.844 --> 18:28.977
You're right about that.
The wounded security guard

18:29.020 --> 18:31.414
mentioned a decal on the truck's
rear window in his statement.

18:31.458 --> 18:34.069
That's right. Said it looked
like a leprechaun's hat.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.549
Yeah. So, I did
a little digging.

18:35.592 --> 18:36.898
There's a men's service club,

18:36.941 --> 18:38.769
uses a green bowler
as its trademark.

18:38.813 --> 18:40.423
- The O'Dunes.
- Exactly.

18:40.467 --> 18:41.990
Bill Longmire.

18:42.033 --> 18:44.384
Applied for a special permit
to pull an O'Dunes float

18:44.427 --> 18:45.559
in a parade two years ago.

18:45.602 --> 18:47.561
Worth checking out.
Nice work, Tan.

18:47.604 --> 18:49.650
But next time,
I don't need the whole journey.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.347
Just get me
to the destination.

18:51.391 --> 18:52.957
Yes, sir.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.183
The truck's a match,
decal and all.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.054
- All right. This crew already
proved to be violent,

19:03.098 --> 19:04.186
so let's make sure
they never get

19:04.230 --> 19:05.492
another chance
to hurt anyone else.

19:05.535 --> 19:07.624
Nice speech.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.060
What's the approach?

19:09.104 --> 19:11.193
I was just getting to
that, fellow jackass.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.716
I'll take Luca,

19:12.760 --> 19:14.153
Alonso and Tan
to the one side.

19:14.196 --> 19:15.806
Hondo, take outside in
case we get a runner.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.765
Deacon and Street
to the three side.

19:18.940 --> 19:20.246
Got something
you want to add?

19:20.289 --> 19:22.857
It's just... Six windows

19:22.900 --> 19:24.728
on the left side of the house.
Only two on the right.

19:24.772 --> 19:26.426
Maybe take the right
to minimize exposure?

19:26.469 --> 19:27.731
I disagree.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.081
Why's that?

19:30.125 --> 19:31.474
Because I can.

19:31.518 --> 19:33.215
'Cause there's a little less
cover on that side,

19:33.259 --> 19:36.218
so it's a coin flip. Look, I
appreciate the input, 27-David,

19:36.262 --> 19:38.220
but as 20-David,
I'll make the call.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.309
Let's move.

20:11.471 --> 20:13.429
20-David.

20:13.473 --> 20:15.126
One side clear for entry.

20:15.170 --> 20:16.389
30-David.
In position on three side,

20:16.432 --> 20:17.651
ready for breach.

20:17.694 --> 20:20.219
On my count. One,

20:20.262 --> 20:22.177
two, three.

20:30.446 --> 20:31.534
Give me two.

20:31.578 --> 20:32.840
One who follows his nature keeps

20:32.883 --> 20:35.799
his original nature in the end.

20:35.843 --> 20:39.542
But haven't you heard ever
of something better to follow?

20:40.369 --> 20:41.283
LAPD!

20:41.327 --> 20:42.153
Search warrant! Do not move!

20:42.197 --> 20:44.068
Hands! Let's see the hands!

20:44.112 --> 20:45.287
Give me two, give me two.

20:46.070 --> 20:47.768
What's going on? What happened?

20:47.811 --> 20:49.944
Your truck was used in
an armed robbery this morning.

20:51.902 --> 20:53.730
Two, two, two.

20:53.774 --> 20:55.079
- What are you talking about?
- You got any guns

20:55.123 --> 20:56.385
on the premises?

20:56.429 --> 20:58.909
No. And I haven't driven
the truck, either.

20:58.953 --> 21:01.390
It's become too much of a hassle
getting out of this wheelchair.

21:01.434 --> 21:03.000
Anybody else have access
to your vehicle?

21:03.044 --> 21:04.872
Just the girl who comes by
to take care of me.

21:04.915 --> 21:06.439
- Pipa.
That's the same name

21:06.482 --> 21:08.310
as the woman who helped Mrs.
Kyle with her storage unit.

21:08.354 --> 21:11.139
Where is she?
- Where do we find Pipa?
Two!

21:11.182 --> 21:13.315
I don't know.
She's here somewhere.

21:19.060 --> 21:20.627
LAPD! Don't move!

21:20.670 --> 21:22.455
We got a rabbit
on the three side!

21:24.674 --> 21:26.502
Get off me!

21:28.374 --> 21:30.724
What's the situation in there?

21:30.767 --> 21:32.073
Stay down!

21:32.116 --> 21:33.335
- You're under arrest.
Nice work,

21:33.379 --> 21:34.989
Alonso.

21:42.562 --> 21:44.955
Look at you, showing
off for the new boss.

21:44.999 --> 21:47.262
Showed you up, anyway.

21:48.089 --> 21:49.264
Code 4 all the way around.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.658
Suspect in custody.
Hold your position.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.372
Hey, Tan.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.592
That little bit of friction

22:12.635 --> 22:14.071
between me and Hondo
out in the field.

22:14.115 --> 22:16.335
That's not gonna cause
any problems, right?

22:16.378 --> 22:18.337
- With Hondo? No way.
- Not with Hondo.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.990
Hondo's a pro.
Little beef like that,

22:20.034 --> 22:21.731
he was over with it
before we hit the house.

22:21.775 --> 22:25.039
I'm talking about with the young
guns. You, Street and Alonso.

22:25.082 --> 22:26.606
You got a lot of loyalty

22:26.649 --> 22:27.824
to Hondo.

22:27.868 --> 22:29.826
Hell, he's earned it.

22:29.870 --> 22:31.132
I just want to make sure

22:31.175 --> 22:32.481
that loyalty
doesn't confuse anybody

22:32.525 --> 22:35.049
where the chain of command
is concerned?

22:35.092 --> 22:36.920
No confusion.

22:36.964 --> 22:38.400
Good. Glad to hear it.

22:38.444 --> 22:41.360
That female suspect
you brought in. Pipa?

22:41.403 --> 22:44.058
She's keeping her mouth shut.
She's not saying a word.

22:44.101 --> 22:46.277
Haven't been able to work
my charms on her yet.

22:46.321 --> 22:48.802
Too late. She lawyered up.
Public defender's already here.

22:48.845 --> 22:50.760
I guess she'd rather go down
as an accessory

22:50.804 --> 22:52.936
than face whatever her
coconspirators would do to her.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.547
Maybe it's not fear
that's keeping her quiet.

22:54.590 --> 22:56.200
Maybe it's loyalty

22:56.244 --> 22:58.812
or some twisted
- version of romance.
- How do you mean?

22:59.465 --> 23:01.292
- We just got a dump
of her phone records,

23:01.336 --> 23:03.512
and for five months, she's
been getting daily rings

23:03.556 --> 23:05.035
from an inmate
up at Lancaster.

23:05.079 --> 23:07.298
- Regular, like clockwork.
Well, she likes bad boys.

23:07.342 --> 23:08.648
- So what?
- Yeah.

23:08.691 --> 23:10.693
Only three weeks ago,
the phone calls stopped.

23:10.737 --> 23:11.955
So either the lovebirds
broke up or...

23:11.999 --> 23:13.827
Or he got sprung in time
to mastermind

23:13.870 --> 23:15.306
- this crime spree.
All right.

23:15.350 --> 23:16.960
Reach out to the prison.
Tell them we're gonna need

23:17.004 --> 23:19.180
a list of every inmate
kicked free three weeks ago.

23:19.223 --> 23:21.443
Ask for Deputy Warden Cook.
Tell him it's Rodrigo Sanchez

23:21.487 --> 23:23.010
- asking.
- Got it.

23:26.317 --> 23:28.232
Hey. I've been
looking for you.

23:28.276 --> 23:30.104
Well, you found me.

23:30.147 --> 23:31.018
What's up?

23:31.061 --> 23:33.281
This whole thing with Sanchez.

23:33.324 --> 23:35.675
It doesn't strike you as wrong?

23:36.806 --> 23:38.504
Luca, I knew
what I was coming back to.

23:38.547 --> 23:39.983
It's just growing pains.

23:40.027 --> 23:41.463
We're all gonna have
to adjust a little bit.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.509
No, no,
I mean just him being here.

23:43.552 --> 23:47.034
Don't you think
- he's up to something?
- Who's up to what?

23:47.861 --> 23:49.428
Well, it sounds like Luca

23:49.471 --> 23:51.952
thinks that Sanchez is
running some kind of game.

23:51.995 --> 23:54.345
No, I didn't... I didn't say
that. I just have a hard time

23:54.389 --> 23:56.652
believing that he came back
to SWAT after all this time

23:56.696 --> 23:58.349
because he was bored
in the mayor's office

23:58.393 --> 23:59.829
or whatever other story
he's peddling.

23:59.873 --> 24:01.396
So, what do you think
is going on?

24:01.440 --> 24:03.572
I don't know yet,
but it's got to be something.

24:03.616 --> 24:05.487
Look, there's no way
a guy like Sanchez

24:05.531 --> 24:07.358
comes back here
without an agenda.

24:07.402 --> 24:09.665
It just doesn't make sense.

24:09.709 --> 24:13.277
Luca, when have you
ever liked Sanchez?

24:13.321 --> 24:14.844
I mean, come on.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.193
Back in the day when you guys
were running 30-Squad,

24:16.237 --> 24:17.804
there was always beef
between you two.

24:17.847 --> 24:19.022
Me and Rocker had

24:19.066 --> 24:20.502
to pull you apart
more than once.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.635
You guys are oil and
water. He's arrogant,

24:22.678 --> 24:23.853
self-centered,
always wants the credit,

24:23.897 --> 24:25.464
and-and you're
a selfless soldier

24:25.507 --> 24:26.726
who always puts the team first.

24:26.769 --> 24:28.597
You-you guys are destined
to bang heads.

24:29.424 --> 24:31.513
Okay, so you trust him, then?

24:34.255 --> 24:35.909
I don't distrust him.

24:37.476 --> 24:40.609
Hey. Just give it a chance.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.742
It's our first day back.
We're all out of our groove.

24:42.785 --> 24:46.093
Let's just wait and
see what happens.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.012
<i>Howard Kyle</i>

24:52.055 --> 24:53.753
was prolific, that's for sure.

24:53.796 --> 24:57.278
I mean, to design
22 office buildings,

24:57.321 --> 24:58.584
see them all get built?

24:58.627 --> 25:00.455
It would be pretty cool
to, you know,

25:00.499 --> 25:02.544
leave a legacy like that.

25:02.588 --> 25:03.806
Something sad
about it, though.

25:03.850 --> 25:05.286
Almost half of them
have been torn down.

25:05.329 --> 25:07.462
What kind of legacy is it
if it's crumbled to the ground

25:07.506 --> 25:08.811
and built over
with something else?

25:08.855 --> 25:11.422
Wow. That's pretty dark.

25:11.466 --> 25:12.902
That really surprise you?

25:12.946 --> 25:15.557
Okay, of the 13 buildings
still standing,

25:15.601 --> 25:17.559
only five seem
like viable targets.

25:17.603 --> 25:18.821
Three are now banks,

25:18.865 --> 25:20.214
one is
in the Jewelry District,

25:20.257 --> 25:21.868
and one is a sneaker store.

25:21.911 --> 25:23.652
They got kicks that
cost more than a car.

25:23.696 --> 25:25.045
Hicks

25:25.088 --> 25:26.612
already alerted patrol
to keep an eye on all 13,

25:26.655 --> 25:28.614
but, uh, why don't you
tell them to add units

25:28.657 --> 25:30.137
around the five
you're talking about.

25:30.180 --> 25:31.878
Okay.

25:41.452 --> 25:43.280
Guess, uh,

25:43.324 --> 25:46.196
kind of blew
- our chance, huh?
- What do you mean?

25:46.240 --> 25:48.721
For a day and a half,
we were on two different squads.

25:48.764 --> 25:50.679
No rules against dating.

25:50.723 --> 25:52.289
We didn't take advantage of it.

25:52.333 --> 25:55.945
I'm glad we didn't. I mean,
can you imagine if we did,

25:55.989 --> 25:57.947
and then suddenly we're back

25:57.991 --> 26:00.167
on the same team again?
What then?

26:00.210 --> 26:02.125
Yeah.

26:02.169 --> 26:04.954
Maybe this version of
20-Squad won't last.

26:04.998 --> 26:06.390
I mean, Sanchez can't love

26:06.434 --> 26:09.045
that we're all
Hondo's teammates to the core.

26:09.089 --> 26:11.265
- Mm.
- He'll probably
try to shuffle

26:11.308 --> 26:13.963
the deck at some point, get a
couple of his own guys in there.

26:14.007 --> 26:16.531
Might be an opportunity
for me to talk to him.

26:16.575 --> 26:17.793
Talk about what?

26:17.837 --> 26:19.969
Transferring?

26:20.013 --> 26:21.188
Street,

26:21.231 --> 26:23.886
the team's fragile enough
as it is.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.627
Yeah, that's my whole point.
This could be

26:25.671 --> 26:26.759
a temporary situation.

26:26.802 --> 26:29.022
Maybe. But it's day one.

26:29.065 --> 26:31.067
Let's just see what happens.

26:34.375 --> 26:35.506
<i>Tan.</i>

26:35.550 --> 26:36.638
What do you got for us?

26:36.682 --> 26:37.813
Prison phone records.

26:37.857 --> 26:39.249
They log
every inmate phone call.

26:39.293 --> 26:41.077
By focusing on inmates
released three weeks ago,

26:41.121 --> 26:42.209
I was able to match the times

26:42.252 --> 26:43.645
and dates
of Pipa's incoming calls

26:43.689 --> 26:45.038
with the phone use
of one of the inmates.

26:45.081 --> 26:46.648
Guy named Garett Hillman.

26:46.692 --> 26:49.477
Probably targeted Pipa for her
connection to the Kyle family.

26:49.520 --> 26:50.870
He's an ex-DEA agent.

26:50.913 --> 26:52.306
Convicted of stealing
drugs and cash

26:52.349 --> 26:53.829
from one of the agency's
evidence lockers

26:53.873 --> 26:54.656
back in 2014.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.005
Paroled three weeks ago.

26:56.049 --> 26:57.833
I'm guessing he
played Pipa all along,

26:57.877 --> 27:00.009
suckered her into helping him
steal the building plans.

27:00.053 --> 27:02.664
Are we any closer to nailing
their ultimate target?

27:02.708 --> 27:03.796
Two minutes ago,
I'd have said no,

27:03.839 --> 27:04.797
but you just mentioned the DEA.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.537
Howard Kyle
designed a building

27:06.581 --> 27:08.104
down on Claymore Street.

27:08.148 --> 27:09.845
It was demolished 12 years ago.
But guess what was built

27:09.889 --> 27:12.456
on that same lot,
over that same foundation?

27:16.896 --> 27:19.376
A new DEA
evidence storage facility.

27:19.420 --> 27:21.335
There's no way
that's a coincidence.

27:21.378 --> 27:22.815
Feds made a huge drug
and money seizure

27:22.858 --> 27:24.686
in El Cajon
two weeks ago.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.775
The entire haul could be sitting
in an evidence locker there.

27:26.819 --> 27:28.908
If Hillman still has
connections inside the DEA,

27:28.951 --> 27:30.170
he'd know about this.

27:30.213 --> 27:31.737
That building?
That's got to be our target.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.564
Tan, get them on the line
and give them a heads-up.

27:33.608 --> 27:35.044
Make sure everyone
and everything

27:35.088 --> 27:36.350
over there is accounted for!

27:36.393 --> 27:38.047
This is good work, Street.

27:38.091 --> 27:41.050
Chris had a hand in it, too.

27:43.357 --> 27:44.488
Makes no sense. They
should be picking up

27:44.532 --> 27:46.055
at the evidence locker.

28:13.082 --> 28:14.867
Sergeant Harrelson!
Soon as you're ready,

28:14.910 --> 28:17.043
- I'll run it down for you.
- Hit pause, Raquel.

28:17.086 --> 28:18.479
I'm not the guy
to talk to anymore.

28:18.522 --> 28:20.786
Sanchez is our
new team leader.

28:20.829 --> 28:22.483
- You the senior on lead?
- Yeah.

28:22.526 --> 28:23.876
- What do you got for me?
- Well, per your
commander's orders,

28:23.919 --> 28:25.399
no one's gone in or out.

28:25.442 --> 28:26.966
We locked the perimeter
as soon as we got here,

28:27.009 --> 28:29.055
did a check-- so far,
everything looks secure.

28:29.098 --> 28:30.970
- All right, thanks.
- Yeah.

28:31.013 --> 28:33.059
- Still no one in there answering.
- All right.

28:33.102 --> 28:34.930
Deacon, take Luca,
Street and Alonso.

28:34.974 --> 28:36.410
Start on the two side,
check for signs of penetration

28:36.453 --> 28:38.412
around the building.
Hondo, Tan, you're with me

28:38.455 --> 28:40.719
on a one-side breach,
shallow to deep. Everyone copy?

28:42.546 --> 28:45.636
Hey! You all got mouths,
use 'em. Speak up.

28:45.680 --> 28:46.637
Roger.

28:46.681 --> 28:48.639
- Roger.
- Roger that.

28:48.683 --> 28:50.772
All right, let's roll.

29:05.439 --> 29:06.614
She's alive.

29:06.657 --> 29:07.963
Wait a minute.

29:08.007 --> 29:10.749
Smoke, or some kind of gas.

29:10.792 --> 29:13.229
Let's mask up.

29:19.496 --> 29:21.194
Tan, mask on.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.205
He's alive.

29:32.248 --> 29:35.034
- Must be a sleeping agent.
- The work of "the Chemist."

29:35.861 --> 29:37.819
Got two more
down over here.

29:45.566 --> 29:47.698
Both still breathing.
We gotta get them out of here.

29:47.742 --> 29:48.961
30-David to D-Team.

29:49.004 --> 29:50.397
All sides of
the building are clear.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.747
- No signs of forced entry.
- Copy that, 30-David.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.183
Keep your eyes peeled.

29:54.227 --> 29:55.576
So, they didn't
breach the building

29:55.619 --> 29:57.839
from the outside
or come in from the front.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.841
Maybe we beat them here? The
smoke was put in play remotely.

29:59.885 --> 30:01.974
No. They went out of their way
to get the blueprints

30:02.017 --> 30:03.149
of the building
that used to stand here.

30:03.192 --> 30:04.846
- They found another way in.
- Tan,

30:04.890 --> 30:07.544
evac these people and get the
paramedics to check them out.

30:07.588 --> 30:08.807
Roger that.

30:08.850 --> 30:10.460
Sanchez, lights.

30:11.331 --> 30:14.508
25-David, we have three victims,
unconscious from inhaling

30:14.551 --> 30:18.251
unknown substance.
- Need R/
- A, my location.

30:30.654 --> 30:33.135
Sanchez, you see that?

30:34.441 --> 30:35.616
Yeah.

30:35.659 --> 30:38.271
Air looks clear here. Masks off.

30:56.942 --> 30:58.682
All right.

31:05.254 --> 31:06.560
LAPD! Show me your hands.

31:10.303 --> 31:12.348
27-David to D-Team,
we are taking fire.

31:12.392 --> 31:14.916
Suspects are in a sub-basement
tunnel below the building.

31:14.960 --> 31:16.048
Roger that.

31:16.091 --> 31:17.527
All units, this is 30 David.

31:17.571 --> 31:18.572
Suspects are armed,

31:18.615 --> 31:20.269
proceed with caution.

31:33.195 --> 31:34.980
Sanchez, they're rabbiting.

31:35.023 --> 31:37.634
After you.

31:37.678 --> 31:40.420
27-David to D-Team,
suspects are in the tunnel

31:40.463 --> 31:41.987
heading north.
We are in foot pursuit.

31:42.030 --> 31:43.945
These old tunnels must

31:43.989 --> 31:45.599
date back to
Howard Kyle's designs.

31:45.642 --> 31:47.427
Which means they know
the layout better,

31:47.470 --> 31:48.950
but they got to get past
the topside perimeter

31:48.994 --> 31:50.082
to make an escape.

31:50.125 --> 31:51.387
These tunnels have switchbacks,

31:51.431 --> 31:52.519
but the decommissioned
water channels

31:52.562 --> 31:53.955
run straight.
That's our play.

31:53.999 --> 31:55.043
Come on, man! Move your ass!

31:55.087 --> 31:56.218
This cash is heavy, man!

31:56.262 --> 31:58.133
You grabbed the light bag.

32:02.790 --> 32:04.966
Move!

32:05.010 --> 32:06.272
Deacon,
we're moving northwest now,

32:06.315 --> 32:07.708
probably 200 yards
from where we dropped in.

32:07.751 --> 32:10.102
Roger that!20-David to D-Team,

32:10.145 --> 32:11.930
roll armored on that heading.

32:11.973 --> 32:13.366
You got to stay
above these guys.

32:13.409 --> 32:16.499
We're on the move. Keep
feeding us your position.

32:20.764 --> 32:23.463
Hey, remember how we took
down the Vargas brothers?

32:23.506 --> 32:24.943
Those tunnels in Little Tokyo?

32:24.986 --> 32:27.989
Still on my
"greatest hits" list.

32:28.816 --> 32:30.209
We're closing in on you!

32:30.252 --> 32:32.428
You know that, right?
It's only a matter time

32:32.472 --> 32:34.865
before we lock your asses up.

32:36.824 --> 32:38.826
Come on!

32:38.869 --> 32:41.350
I'm not gonna
wait for you!

32:42.134 --> 32:43.657
Help!

32:43.700 --> 32:46.573
Brock? Brock!

32:51.926 --> 32:55.147
If you're <i>real</i> good, we might
come back for you after.

32:55.190 --> 32:57.018
Our latest greatest hit.

32:57.062 --> 32:59.890
Won't mean a whole hell of a lot
if the last one gets away.

32:59.934 --> 33:01.414
What are we standing here for?

33:10.771 --> 33:12.077
27-David to all D-Teams,

33:12.120 --> 33:13.643
we are moving east,
best as I can tell,

33:13.687 --> 33:15.558
about 100 yards
from our last position.

33:15.602 --> 33:17.647
Deac, be advised, suspect

33:17.691 --> 33:18.909
has a good lead on us.

33:18.953 --> 33:20.694
Roger that!
We're fanned out,

33:20.737 --> 33:22.565
just south of you now,
near Greeley.

33:25.873 --> 33:28.006
LAPD!
Stop right there!

33:34.403 --> 33:36.579
Deacon, our suspect
is above ground.

33:36.623 --> 33:39.452
I repeat, Garett is topside,
making an escape.

33:39.495 --> 33:42.368
Led us right to him, Hondo.
We're in pursuit.

33:42.411 --> 33:46.067
Eyes on suspect,
Eighth and Greeley.

33:46.111 --> 33:47.764
He's headed for a car,
mid-Greeley.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.033
Garett Hillman, this is LAPD!
Get out of the car,

33:55.076 --> 33:56.643
put your hands in the air!

33:56.686 --> 33:58.514
Shut off the car, now!

33:58.558 --> 34:00.125
Get your hands
where we can see them!

34:04.825 --> 34:07.175
It's over, Garett.
Turn the engine off,

34:07.219 --> 34:10.091
hands on the wheel
and do not move.

34:14.095 --> 34:17.055
Chris, rear window.

34:17.968 --> 34:19.274
Switching to pepper balls.

34:24.366 --> 34:26.629
Get your hands
where we can see them!

34:26.673 --> 34:28.327
- All right, all right!
- Get out of the car,

34:28.370 --> 34:29.937
- put your hands in the air!
- All right, all right!

34:29.980 --> 34:31.721
- I'm coming out.
- Get out!

34:31.765 --> 34:34.246
On the ground right now--
on the ground!

34:34.289 --> 34:35.769
Hands behind your back!

34:37.858 --> 34:39.425
26-David.

34:39.468 --> 34:43.124
Final suspect in custody.
Show us Code 4.

34:55.832 --> 34:57.530
Team, hold up a sec.

34:58.487 --> 34:59.793
I want to address something.

34:59.836 --> 35:01.925
Usually, we do
the after-action debriefs

35:01.969 --> 35:04.102
while we're still
- in the field.
- This ain't a debrief.

35:04.145 --> 35:05.277
I got nothing to criticize.

35:05.320 --> 35:06.974
That was tight
work back there.

35:07.017 --> 35:08.584
Just a victory speech, huh?

35:08.628 --> 35:11.544
No, let's call it
a confession.

35:12.632 --> 35:14.329
All right, cards
on the table,

35:14.373 --> 35:16.157
I was sent here to figure out
what's in the water--

35:16.201 --> 35:19.769
see why this team imploded
the past few months.

35:19.813 --> 35:23.295
Officer Rogers getting killed
on your watch; Deac,

35:23.338 --> 35:24.687
you recording other
cops; Hondo,

35:24.731 --> 35:26.472
you leaking to
the <i>Times...</i>

35:26.515 --> 35:28.213
You're leaving out a lot
- of context.
- You're right.

35:28.256 --> 35:30.345
I see that now.

35:32.782 --> 35:35.524
It's clear I don't need to
pull you back together--

35:35.568 --> 35:38.005
you're already
kick-ass as a team.

35:38.875 --> 35:42.227
I came here thinking this
was gonna be a chore.

35:43.053 --> 35:46.709
But after today, I'm just
looking forward to tomorrow.

35:47.667 --> 35:50.191
Great job, every one of you.

35:51.236 --> 35:52.498
Thanks.

35:52.541 --> 35:54.761
- We appreciate it.
- Thanks.

35:56.850 --> 35:58.417
Listen up.

35:58.460 --> 36:03.335
May not be what we expected,
but we're gonna make it work.

36:03.378 --> 36:07.121
He's lucky to have you,
and so am I.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.949
Just glad you're finally back.

36:08.992 --> 36:11.125
Glad we're all back.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.866
Sanchez ain't wrong.

36:12.909 --> 36:14.084
It is gonna be fun,

36:14.128 --> 36:15.216
going forward.

36:24.225 --> 36:28.534
Well, didn't make things
sound very temporary, did it?

36:30.100 --> 36:34.801
So, I guess 20-Squad's back
for good. And so are the rules.

36:36.498 --> 36:39.066
You know, I never thought
I'd be disappointed

36:39.109 --> 36:41.242
to have to keep
working with you.

36:43.113 --> 36:44.898
What do we do now?

36:47.292 --> 36:49.076
We keep doing
what we've been doing.

36:49.119 --> 36:51.078
For how long?

36:51.121 --> 36:53.428
As long as we have to, I guess.

37:07.399 --> 37:09.096
Uh, Sergeant Harrelson.

37:09.139 --> 37:11.316
Just wanted to let you know,
I'm glad to see you're back.

37:11.359 --> 37:12.708
Means a lot.

37:14.101 --> 37:15.363
We met before?

37:15.407 --> 37:17.278
No, I'm Reece Tatum.

37:17.322 --> 37:18.888
SWAT cadet.

37:18.932 --> 37:22.588
You taking on the system,
calling out those racist cops?

37:22.631 --> 37:25.112
You're the reason some of us
signed up for this.

37:25.155 --> 37:26.592
Just wanted to
let you know.

37:26.635 --> 37:30.770
I appreciate you, my man, I do.

37:31.640 --> 37:34.252
Good luck in the SWAT Academy.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.055
Hey, Pop.

37:55.098 --> 37:56.883
Hey, son.

37:56.926 --> 37:59.102
Listen, I made some salmon
if you're interested--

37:59.146 --> 38:01.148
brown rice, broccoli.

38:01.191 --> 38:02.497
So,

38:02.541 --> 38:04.978
how was the first day
back to school?

38:06.371 --> 38:08.329
It was all right.

38:08.373 --> 38:10.853
Seeing my team again
felt real good.

38:11.811 --> 38:14.422
But watching another guy
lead 20-Squad,

38:14.466 --> 38:16.642
hearing him use my call sign...

38:16.685 --> 38:19.688
Let me guess--
flat-out sucked.

38:20.950 --> 38:22.474
To be honest, it hurt.

38:23.388 --> 38:25.303
You made your choice.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.348
I did.

38:27.392 --> 38:29.350
And I support that.

38:31.047 --> 38:32.484
Salmon's in the fridge.

38:32.527 --> 38:34.050
Thanks, Pop.

38:35.748 --> 38:37.880
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Hmm.

38:49.109 --> 38:51.590
- Hey.
- Hey, sorry to just
drop by like this,

38:51.633 --> 38:54.506
but, um, can we come in?

38:55.333 --> 38:56.899
Sure.

38:56.943 --> 38:59.902
Hondo, meet Renee.
This is Hondo.

39:04.472 --> 39:06.561
- How you doing?
- Hello.

39:07.475 --> 39:10.260
- Is everything okay?
- Not really. Um...

39:10.304 --> 39:11.827
look, I know you
and Deacon think

39:11.871 --> 39:14.003
I'm off base about Sanchez.

39:14.047 --> 39:17.355
And it's true-- I never vibed
with the guy back in the day.

39:17.398 --> 39:19.400
And after our talk earlier,
I was pretty much ready

39:19.444 --> 39:21.446
to just roll with it
for the sake of the team,

39:21.489 --> 39:24.840
but I decided to make
a couple of calls first.

39:24.884 --> 39:27.539
Renee here, she's a staffer

39:27.582 --> 39:29.758
for the police commission.

39:31.020 --> 39:32.805
Tell him.

39:33.588 --> 39:37.070
First, you did not hear
any of this from me, okay?

39:37.113 --> 39:38.985
I mean, I wouldn't even be here
except for the fact that

39:39.028 --> 39:42.162
I really respect you for
what you did, going public.

39:42.205 --> 39:45.644
- People needed to know.
- Yes, they did.

39:45.687 --> 39:48.951
So, when I heard that my boss
and the others on the commission

39:48.995 --> 39:51.606
were demoting you, I thought,
"Well, that-that's not right."

39:51.650 --> 39:53.086
It's not.

39:54.304 --> 39:56.785
The other day, when the bosses
heard that you were

39:56.829 --> 39:58.526
returning to SWAT,
they weren't happy.

39:58.570 --> 40:00.702
So, they came up
with a plan.

40:01.703 --> 40:03.139
A plan?

40:03.183 --> 40:04.706
Rodrigo Sanchez.

40:04.750 --> 40:07.013
They sent him to
get you to quit.

40:07.056 --> 40:08.841
It's his one and
only job there.

40:08.884 --> 40:10.190
They offered him
something big

40:10.233 --> 40:12.410
- if he could do it.
- Okay, hold up.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.021
Sanchez is in on this?

40:15.064 --> 40:16.979
I overheard him

40:17.023 --> 40:19.329
telling my boss that it wouldn't
take him long to get rid of you.

40:21.070 --> 40:24.247
Look, I am risking my job
telling you this,

40:24.291 --> 40:27.425
but after talking to Luca,
I just...

40:27.468 --> 40:28.426
I thought you should know.

40:50.665 --> 40:52.667
