00:00.066 --> 00:00.266
█

00:01.034 --> 00:07.607
reads words on screen

00:10.043 --> 00:14.914
<i>Tonight, on Bachelor in
Paradise Canada...</i>

00:14.981 --> 00:17.384
I think tensions are high
because we're going into the

00:17.450 --> 00:19.586
last rose ceremony and,
it really feels like

00:19.652 --> 00:20.954
things are coming
to the end.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.355
Anything important
to talk about?

00:22.422 --> 00:23.656
A lot of things to chat about.

00:23.723 --> 00:26.693
Am I gonna push it or am I
going to back away?

00:26.760 --> 00:29.262
Better be on the same page
about things and

00:29.329 --> 00:30.730
not save it for
the last minute.

00:30.797 --> 00:34.501
My experience ending Paradise
last year wasn't great.

00:34.567 --> 00:36.936
And I would love not to go
through that again.

00:37.003 --> 00:38.538
We can just leave right now.

00:38.605 --> 00:40.573
Like,where is this
all coming from?

00:40.640 --> 00:41.641
Now that the end is nearing,
like,

00:41.708 --> 00:43.943
my head is just running a
million miles a minute.

00:44.010 --> 00:46.045
Feelings escalate quickly,
but right now

00:46.112 --> 00:48.548
it just seems like a
very scary jump.

00:48.615 --> 00:51.785
Logic definitely needs
to come into play.

00:51.851 --> 00:53.753
I know Maria's
interested in Josh.

00:53.820 --> 00:56.389
I have to step up my
game a little bit.

00:56.456 --> 00:57.390
Can I steal you away?

00:57.457 --> 01:00.293
I know he set up this
nice date, but frankly,

01:00.360 --> 01:01.494
I don't give a shit.

01:01.561 --> 01:03.396
I'm going in there,
I'm breaking this up.

01:03.463 --> 01:05.498
I'm taking my lady.

01:05.565 --> 01:07.734
At the end of the day, I put it
all out on the table.

01:07.801 --> 01:10.703
Well, I'm here to
shake things up.

01:10.770 --> 01:12.072
Something's going down.

01:12.138 --> 01:14.374
And I can definitely feel
the stress in the air.

01:14.441 --> 01:18.311
The next phase, overnight dates
in the fantasy suites.

01:18.378 --> 01:20.079
Today's gonna be a huge day.

01:20.146 --> 01:21.848
I feel like there's
gonna be break ups.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.750
I don't know if I'm
ready for this.

01:23.817 --> 01:27.020
Drama and the romance, that's
all coming to an end.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.721
Right now it feels to me
like you don't even

01:28.788 --> 01:30.523
want to take this
outside of here.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.759
Now I'm starting to feel
like I've been

01:32.826 --> 01:34.461
gaslit throughout
all of this.

01:34.527 --> 01:38.097
Today is the day that
everything in Paradise changes.

03:02.215 --> 03:05.485
Ah!

03:05.552 --> 03:08.721
- Hello!
- Hello, good sir.

03:08.788 --> 03:10.089
Can I take you up?

03:11.958 --> 03:13.459
It's a new day in Paradise.

03:13.526 --> 03:16.462
I think that the rose ceremony
is coming today.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.431
It feels like it's
about that time.

03:18.498 --> 03:21.701
So, Lisa, is Connor
getting your rose?

03:21.768 --> 03:23.603
What's the body language
expert say?

03:23.670 --> 03:25.205
I don't have to tell you
how you feel.

03:25.271 --> 03:27.473
Ooh.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.475
I want to spend as much time
with Connor as possible.

03:29.542 --> 03:30.977
There is a rose ceremony
coming up.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.546
And, I just feel like I need
to get to know him better

03:33.613 --> 03:36.749
because we've had
such limited time.

03:36.816 --> 03:38.651
I'm feeling good today.
I'm just looking forward to

03:38.718 --> 03:41.187
hanging out with Lisa again
and continuing to dive into...

03:41.254 --> 03:42.388
our connection.

03:42.455 --> 03:46.526
She's so funny and so quirky
and, I love that about her.

03:46.593 --> 03:48.761
"Mrrr"
Okay.

03:48.828 --> 03:51.698
Goodbye, boys.

03:51.764 --> 03:54.901
Girls have the roses this week
so, pressure is building.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.569
For the last couple
rose ceremonies,

03:56.636 --> 03:58.171
Lisa and I have been
exchanging roses.

03:58.237 --> 04:00.607
But now she's found someone
she really likes so,

04:00.673 --> 04:03.643
my best chance at a rose
is definitely Maria.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.111
- What's up, cutie?
- What's up?

04:05.178 --> 04:06.813
I know you guys are having a
little cute moment.

04:06.879 --> 04:08.214
- Yeah.
- Can I steal you away?

04:08.281 --> 04:10.483
- Yeah.
- Here's your drink.

04:10.550 --> 04:11.985
Should I leave you the chips,
Josh?

04:12.051 --> 04:14.187
He's gonna smash those.

04:14.253 --> 04:15.955
I feel pretty confident that
when it comes down to it,

04:16.022 --> 04:17.056
Maria will pick me over Karn.

04:17.123 --> 04:18.725
Given the amount of time
that we've had versus the

04:18.791 --> 04:19.993
amount of time that
they've spent together.

04:20.059 --> 04:21.995
But hey, this is Paradise,
and you never know.

04:22.061 --> 04:23.062
- How you doing?
- Good, how are you?

04:23.129 --> 04:25.632
You look so nice.
I love your, I love your style.

04:25.698 --> 04:27.000
I know Maria's
interested in Josh,

04:27.066 --> 04:28.501
but I don't want to
close that door.

04:28.568 --> 04:31.638
I have to step up my
game a little bit and...

04:31.704 --> 04:33.172
win Maria's heart over.

04:33.239 --> 04:35.775
I need to meet someone
with great sense of style.

04:35.842 --> 04:36.876
That's huge for me.

04:36.943 --> 04:39.212
And I'm like, Maria's got a
great sense of style.

04:39.278 --> 04:40.913
- She crushes it.
- Oh, thank you.

04:40.980 --> 04:42.715
I don't know, with you
I just felt like it was...

04:42.782 --> 04:45.885
I saw you and I was like,
this girl's mad cute.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.520
Oh, that's really sweet.

04:47.587 --> 04:51.257
I'm liking connecting with
Karn in this moment because

04:51.324 --> 04:54.027
I can just like be myself
and like, it's funny.

04:54.093 --> 04:59.032
I'm really excited to see
where this connection goes.

04:59.098 --> 05:01.034
I'd say there's definitely
pressure in the air.

05:01.100 --> 05:05.038
Joey and Vay decided to depart
as a couple together.

05:05.104 --> 05:06.806
My best friend's
getting married.

05:06.873 --> 05:09.208
I gotta be the best man
in the wedding and,

05:09.275 --> 05:10.810
I need my best girl
there with me.

05:10.877 --> 05:13.179
I asked Vay and she said
yes to come with me!

05:13.246 --> 05:15.682
- And she's coming to Alberta!
- No!

05:15.748 --> 05:18.818
Guys, Paradise works.
It really does.

05:18.885 --> 05:21.554
- Bye, guys!
- Let's go to a wedding.

05:21.621 --> 05:24.590
I think overall tensions are
high because serious couples

05:24.657 --> 05:26.893
here are trying to figure out
how their relationship would

05:26.959 --> 05:28.261
work in real life because
we're going into the last

05:28.327 --> 05:30.563
rose ceremony,
and it really feels like

05:30.630 --> 05:32.098
things are coming
to the end.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.100
I know some of us
have a better idea of

05:34.167 --> 05:35.368
what we're gonna do
at this point.

05:35.435 --> 05:38.771
We have Angela and Brendan M.,
which I would say is probably

05:38.838 --> 05:40.239
the strongest couple in
Paradise and the

05:40.306 --> 05:42.108
most likely to get engaged.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.876
Are you falling in love?

05:43.943 --> 05:46.179
I'm falling into something.

05:46.245 --> 05:48.614
And I know some of us
are very unsure.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.184
Kamil and Caitlin,
I really have no idea

05:51.250 --> 05:54.687
what's going on there.
They're 50/50.

05:54.754 --> 05:57.857
Kit and Alex,
I don't know if

05:57.924 --> 06:00.126
they will leave
Paradise together.

06:00.193 --> 06:03.029
When you have like a lot of
couples in here that have like,

06:03.096 --> 06:05.998
committed to relationships and
that are thinking about

06:06.065 --> 06:07.600
marriage and thinking
about moving forward,

06:07.667 --> 06:10.036
it's hard not to feel that
pressure and just like,

06:10.103 --> 06:11.671
should I be at that point too?

06:11.738 --> 06:15.274
I want whatever's
best for you.

06:15.341 --> 06:18.778
Stacy and Mike, I could see
those two break up so,

06:18.845 --> 06:21.280
it's just my
Lisa prediction.

06:21.347 --> 06:23.349
As the rose ceremony
is coming up,

06:23.416 --> 06:25.218
there's a little bit
of time left here.

06:25.284 --> 06:27.620
Anything important to
talk about?

06:27.687 --> 06:29.188
A lot of things to chat about.

06:29.255 --> 06:32.792
I wanted to feel out
where Stacy is in this,

06:32.859 --> 06:34.327
and what she's feeling.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.096
I feel like we are...

06:37.163 --> 06:38.631
in a gray area.

06:38.698 --> 06:41.968
We are. We're somewhere
in the middle.

06:42.034 --> 06:44.704
We're coming down to the nitty
gritty and it's hard not to

06:44.771 --> 06:47.306
think about it, but it's like,
that's just the reality.

06:47.373 --> 06:48.341
Mhm.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.643
Everything moves so quickly
here in Paradise,

06:50.710 --> 06:52.645
but we haven't, we haven't
moved quickly.

06:52.712 --> 06:55.748
I feel like our emotional,
like,

06:55.815 --> 06:59.685
deep connection has
been slower than...

06:59.752 --> 07:01.420
where I would like to be.

07:01.487 --> 07:04.891
Can we get there in the short
amount of time that we have?

07:04.957 --> 07:08.761
That's my number one
thing on my mind.

07:08.828 --> 07:12.098
I need to figure out who
Mike is as a person.

07:12.165 --> 07:13.432
We have so many
laughs together.

07:13.499 --> 07:16.035
But it's so much more than
just having fun and

07:16.102 --> 07:17.103
having a good time.

07:17.170 --> 07:20.706
I need to be able to trust
my partner and, and...

07:20.773 --> 07:22.809
have them, you know, ask me
the deep questions and

07:22.875 --> 07:24.744
just open up and
be vulnerable.

07:24.811 --> 07:29.415
When I think of this rose
ceremony, I think...

07:29.482 --> 07:32.351
you know, what's next?

07:32.418 --> 07:34.887
It's been, honestly,
pretty stressful for me.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.289
Am I gonna push it?

07:36.355 --> 07:39.425
Or am I going to back
away a little bit?

07:39.492 --> 07:42.295
What we can agree on,
for sure,

07:42.361 --> 07:44.697
is that we're both
into each other.

07:44.764 --> 07:46.199
I think the world of you,
and I had-

07:46.265 --> 07:48.034
I am having so
much fun here.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.203
Yeah. I know we have
limited time and

07:50.269 --> 07:53.139
I know we've gotta figure
this out quick.

07:53.206 --> 07:56.442
But, do we use our time
trying to figure out

07:56.509 --> 07:58.211
if this is going to work?

07:58.277 --> 08:01.247
Or do we use this time to try
to keep connecting?

08:01.314 --> 08:03.816
Do we keep going...

08:03.883 --> 08:05.184
if it's just gonna be like this?

08:05.251 --> 08:06.752
Like, I'm just
waiting for it to,

08:06.819 --> 08:08.487
to get to where it's
supposed to be.

08:08.554 --> 08:11.023
I do want to be there to be
supportive of you.

08:11.090 --> 08:14.026
But my mind's maybe just like a
little step back of just trying

08:14.093 --> 08:17.096
to figure out, as a
relationship, like...

08:17.163 --> 08:19.999
what are we, what do
we prioritize here?

08:20.066 --> 08:23.436
There's just a lot of unknown
happening in my brain right now.

08:37.583 --> 08:40.453
I like that we're on the
same page ́cause like,

08:40.519 --> 08:42.955
we only have a few
days left. It's weird.

08:43.022 --> 08:45.424
Our relationship is just,
it's in the perfect spot.

08:45.491 --> 08:48.361
Just happy, open.
Trying to figure it out,

08:48.427 --> 08:50.029
but there's something
there for sure.

08:50.096 --> 08:52.031
But it feels good to know
'cause I know like a lot of

08:52.098 --> 08:54.901
people here are kind of
unsure what the future holds

08:54.967 --> 08:58.004
for their relationships
and it's like...

08:58.070 --> 09:01.407
took us, took us a little bit
of a bumpy ride to get here,

09:01.474 --> 09:04.543
but now we're here.

09:04.610 --> 09:06.546
I guess...

09:06.612 --> 09:09.081
tonight might be the
rose ceremony.

09:09.148 --> 09:10.816
Yeah.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.785
Do you want to prep, Kamil?

09:12.852 --> 09:14.086
No, I'm just saying, like,

09:14.153 --> 09:17.356
better be on the same
page about things and...

09:17.423 --> 09:19.825
not save it for last minute.

09:19.892 --> 09:23.462
My experience ending Paradise
last year wasn't great.

09:23.529 --> 09:26.999
At the end, I had to break
up with Annalise because

09:27.066 --> 09:28.935
it was just too much.
I couldn't handle it.

09:29.001 --> 09:31.170
And I would love not to go
through that again.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.539
We can just leave right now
and get that alone time,

09:33.606 --> 09:34.974
and take advantage of it.

09:35.041 --> 09:37.209
And, work things out
in the real world.

09:37.276 --> 09:39.412
Get that alone time
where, like...?

09:39.478 --> 09:41.547
In a cab ride home,
like, it's, it's easy.

09:41.614 --> 09:43.816
- I'm confused.
- It's easy.

09:43.883 --> 09:45.318
We're getting close
to the end so,

09:45.384 --> 09:47.453
why would I leave
Paradise right now?

09:47.520 --> 09:49.822
Like, where is this
all coming from?

09:49.889 --> 09:53.392
I'm just being honest about
my experience from the past.

09:53.459 --> 09:56.329
I just had, you know,
like bad [beep]...

09:56.395 --> 09:58.464
flashbacks of it.

09:58.531 --> 10:01.300
I get his standpoint and I
get Caitlin's for sure,

10:01.367 --> 10:02.335
and I have her back too.

10:02.401 --> 10:04.837
I suppose I could kind of
understand why Kamil

10:04.904 --> 10:07.273
feels the way he feels.
I don't know what happened.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.175
But how can you live in the
past and expect

10:09.241 --> 10:11.344
to build a future
with someone?

10:11.410 --> 10:13.045
I hope they figure it out.

10:13.112 --> 10:16.048
And, I think it will be
good for us to

10:16.115 --> 10:17.483
have those conversations.

10:17.550 --> 10:18.484
Right.

10:18.551 --> 10:23.055
Last night, I just said,
"Brendan, I love you."

10:23.122 --> 10:26.258
I love you.

10:26.325 --> 10:30.429
I know you do.
And I love you too.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.868
Those words carry a lot
of weight to me.

10:35.935 --> 10:39.372
I think yesterday I was,
you know, on cloud nine.

10:39.438 --> 10:42.642
And then today I feel a lot
more in my head.

10:42.708 --> 10:43.709
I want you happy.

10:43.776 --> 10:45.644
That's why I just want to do
things right and-

10:45.711 --> 10:46.946
I know.

10:47.013 --> 10:49.382
I've always looked
ahead with you.

10:49.448 --> 10:51.217
That's why I think...

10:52.952 --> 10:55.187
I'm ready to start life outside
of Paradise with Illeana.

10:55.254 --> 10:57.323
I'm just, I'm excited to see
what the real world

10:57.390 --> 10:58.491
has to bring us.

10:58.557 --> 11:00.626
We've leaned on each other
through this whole process.

11:00.693 --> 11:03.129
We fell in love.
We're happy,

11:03.195 --> 11:06.065
we've been laughing and
it's like so light and fun.

11:06.132 --> 11:09.101
But I just think that logic

11:09.168 --> 11:11.170
definitely needs
to come into play.

11:11.237 --> 11:13.105
Especially when it comes to
like matters of love.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.074
- For sure.
- Yeah.

11:15.141 --> 11:18.277
It is Paradise and feelings
escalate quickly.

11:18.344 --> 11:21.380
But right now it just seems
like a very scary jump.

11:21.447 --> 11:22.515
So, now that the end
is nearing,

11:22.581 --> 11:24.984
my head is just running a
million miles a minute and

11:25.051 --> 11:27.953
I'm like, oh God, this works
in the bubble of Paradise.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.256
Like we have real, adult things
that we have to deal with

11:30.322 --> 11:31.457
when we get outside of here.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.093
And like, are we
equipped to do that?

11:34.160 --> 11:35.294
I know, baby.

11:35.361 --> 11:38.964
I feel like I've acted with my
heart all the way through.

11:39.031 --> 11:42.001
But now I have to start
using my head.

11:42.068 --> 11:43.035
A bit more.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.209
I just want to make sure
that we're heading

11:50.276 --> 11:52.044
in the same direction.

11:52.111 --> 11:57.083
Not only just romantically,
but goals and dreams.

11:57.149 --> 12:00.553
And I'm just not sure he's
understanding that.

12:00.619 --> 12:02.254
So, it's finding the
right language and

12:02.321 --> 12:04.256
way to navigate this.

12:06.725 --> 12:08.394
The reason I'm putting,

12:08.461 --> 12:11.530
you know, emphasis on
this time is just...

12:11.597 --> 12:13.699
because it'd be nice
to have time alone.

12:13.766 --> 12:15.067
Yeah, no, I agree.

12:15.134 --> 12:16.268
We're going to be
leaving this and

12:16.335 --> 12:18.204
you are going to be
going back home.

12:18.270 --> 12:20.372
Like, it just doesn't
seem like I'm,

12:20.439 --> 12:22.741
I'm really like part
of the plan.

12:22.808 --> 12:25.344
Caitlin, I've been telling
you every single day that-

12:25.411 --> 12:27.246
Okay, right, I'm crazy,
I'm crazy.

12:27.313 --> 12:28.514
No, you're not.

12:28.581 --> 12:32.551
I should feel like my
boyfriend wants to like

12:32.618 --> 12:33.719
spend time with
me before leaving.

12:33.786 --> 12:36.155
I do. Caitlin, it's not like
I want to abandon you and

12:36.222 --> 12:38.057
leave you here.
I want to spend time with you.

12:38.124 --> 12:39.558
I just want somebody to be
there for me because

12:39.625 --> 12:41.594
I'm not really feeling
that way right now.

12:41.660 --> 12:44.363
Kamil, it's about having
more time with you.

12:44.430 --> 12:48.100
It's all about you.
I want to spend time with you.

12:48.167 --> 12:51.036
And if I'm selfish for wanting
to spend more time with you

12:51.103 --> 12:54.540
before you leave and I have to
miss you, then so be it.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.143
Like, I don't think I'm
really asking for that much.

12:57.209 --> 12:59.278
And I understand that you're
like emotionally drained

12:59.345 --> 13:01.413
but like, [beep],
man, so am I.

13:01.480 --> 13:05.184
We went in talking about one
thing and now, all of a sudden,

13:05.251 --> 13:06.719
I'm doing something
wrong again.

13:06.785 --> 13:09.021
And I don't know what
I've done wrong.

13:09.088 --> 13:12.792
It's like talking to a wall.
I want you to feel supported.

13:12.858 --> 13:15.327
I want you to feel like I'm
here for you and I'm listening.

13:15.394 --> 13:18.564
And I think I've been like
very like open

13:18.631 --> 13:20.599
with you emotionally
throughout all of this.

13:20.666 --> 13:22.134
And I'm trying.

13:22.201 --> 13:24.336
But like, I need you to
hear me too when

13:24.403 --> 13:26.338
I'm saying that this
is how I feel.

13:26.405 --> 13:28.541
Now I'm starting to
feel like I've

13:28.607 --> 13:30.543
been gaslit throughout
all of this.

13:30.609 --> 13:32.178
And now I'm like, what have
I been doing wrong?

13:32.244 --> 13:33.445
Is this right for me?

13:33.512 --> 13:35.181
You got a point there,
saying that

13:35.247 --> 13:37.817
you're being there for me.
And that's what I want.

13:37.883 --> 13:40.586
We've been committed to each
other for the most part this

13:40.653 --> 13:45.291
entire journey so, to walk away
from that would be sad.

13:45.357 --> 13:47.359
So, you want to stick
around another day?

13:47.426 --> 13:49.495
I'll stick around
another day.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.842
...Desperate times call for
desperate measures.

14:06.378 --> 14:08.914
Wow...

14:08.981 --> 14:10.649
Hey!

14:14.353 --> 14:15.888
How's everyone
feeling tonight?

14:15.955 --> 14:17.489
Good!

14:17.556 --> 14:18.791
It's good to see you.

14:18.857 --> 14:21.860
Well, we've reached another
rose ceremony evening.

14:21.927 --> 14:24.496
If I look around, it's very
clear that there's some

14:24.563 --> 14:26.031
love building in the air.

14:26.098 --> 14:28.300
It makes me happy to know
that Paradise is doing

14:28.367 --> 14:31.303
exactly what it's
supposed to be doing.

14:31.370 --> 14:34.273
If you haven't found yourself
in a relationship as yet,

14:34.340 --> 14:38.677
the odds of you sticking around
in Paradise, not so good.

14:38.744 --> 14:40.913
However, if you have found
yourself in a connection,

14:40.980 --> 14:46.051
it's important to know that
time is running out.

14:46.118 --> 14:48.654
So, keep that in mind tonight.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.322
Enjoy the cocktail party.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.057
Loosen up a little bit,
too, okay.

14:52.124 --> 14:55.527
And I'll see you all at the
rose ceremony soon.

14:55.594 --> 14:57.496
Thank you!

14:59.932 --> 15:01.333
Excuse me, guys.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.801
Things are just becoming
a lot more real

15:02.868 --> 15:06.472
between Brendan S. and I.

15:06.538 --> 15:08.807
Less confused tonight?

15:08.874 --> 15:11.644
I mean...
like, what are you feeling?

15:11.710 --> 15:15.381
I'm nervous and hesitant to
have these conversations

15:15.447 --> 15:17.016
with Brendan S. because

15:17.082 --> 15:20.452
I don't know how
he's going to respond.

15:20.519 --> 15:22.321
I just want to make things
easier on you.

15:22.388 --> 15:24.690
It's not about making it
easier on me.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.493
It's about you telling me what
you think is best for you.

15:27.559 --> 15:30.062
And me telling you what
I think is best for me.

15:30.129 --> 15:31.797
And then we make
a compromise.

15:31.864 --> 15:35.334
- What's best for you?
- I just asked you first.

15:35.401 --> 15:37.403
I, I really don't know.
I mean, like I,

15:37.469 --> 15:39.571
I want to be here.
I love you.

15:39.638 --> 15:42.708
Now is the time to start
being more practical and

15:42.775 --> 15:44.109
logical about things.

15:44.176 --> 15:47.646
I want to be with you, babe.
I, I want to be with you.

15:47.713 --> 15:50.749
That's not my
question, Brendan.

15:50.816 --> 15:52.951
- Illy.
- Brendan.

15:53.018 --> 15:56.555
I have tried to kind of let
him know where I'm at.

15:56.622 --> 15:58.557
I don't know if he actually
gets the point of

15:58.624 --> 16:00.059
what I'm trying to say.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.628
I'm still so happy to be
by your side and,

16:02.695 --> 16:06.398
be with you and just hug you
and open up about stuff.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.033
Okay.

16:08.100 --> 16:09.568
Appreciate you.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.003
You too.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.138
I think there's gonna be doubts
in any single relationship

16:13.205 --> 16:14.907
you have, especially
leaving Paradise.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.875
It's normal.
I'm still feeling very

16:16.942 --> 16:19.111
confident with Illeana
and I's relationship.

16:30.889 --> 16:32.725
I'm gonna grab a drink.
Do you want to come with me?

16:32.791 --> 16:35.627
- Sure, let's go.
- Cool.

16:35.694 --> 16:37.996
The cocktail party starts.
Immediately I pull Maria.

16:38.063 --> 16:39.732
The ceremony's coming up,

16:39.798 --> 16:41.767
and I haven't kissed
this girl yet.

16:41.834 --> 16:46.105
This feels like
my last chance.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.874
Okay, so like, we just met,
it's been really cool.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.142
- Yeah.
- And...

16:50.209 --> 16:52.878
what I know from you so far and
like your personality is great.

16:52.945 --> 16:53.979
I really enjoy hanging
out with you.

16:54.046 --> 16:55.014
Me too.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.782
So, I would love to spend
another day with you

16:56.849 --> 16:58.050
because I want to get to
know you more.

16:58.117 --> 16:59.785
Obviously, like, it would've
been really cool

16:59.852 --> 17:02.020
if you came earlier.

17:02.087 --> 17:03.756
Earlier.

17:03.822 --> 17:07.192
Tonight's cocktail party is
probably the most important

17:07.259 --> 17:12.498
so far because now we're
almost at the end of Paradise.

17:12.564 --> 17:16.001
I feel like giving a rose to
someone just proves that you

17:16.068 --> 17:19.772
are interested in how
things are going and

17:19.838 --> 17:22.007
in advancing
your connection.

17:25.210 --> 17:29.014
- I don't bite.
- I know.

17:29.081 --> 17:30.949
These bugs,
these bugs do though.

17:31.016 --> 17:33.118
She's right up next to me,
the body language is great.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.754
Everything's firing and I'm
thinking, this is the moment.

17:35.821 --> 17:38.190
This is the perfect
moment to kiss Ma-

17:38.257 --> 17:40.058
What's going on?
How you doing?

17:40.125 --> 17:42.895
- Can I steal you away?
- Yeah, absolutely.

17:42.961 --> 17:44.229
Karn walks in.

17:44.296 --> 17:46.031
- See you soon, Josh.
- I'll catch you in a bit.

17:46.098 --> 17:48.867
Ugh!
Wrong moment, buddy.

17:48.934 --> 17:50.636
I get that you want to
talk to her, man,

17:50.702 --> 17:52.037
but you're in the last
quarter of the game.

17:52.104 --> 17:52.871
It's not gonna happen.

17:52.938 --> 17:54.740
I'm trying to get my
kiss in, alight?

18:00.846 --> 18:03.615
Well, let's try it.

18:03.682 --> 18:06.819
I still feel like I need to
show Maria a gesture

18:06.885 --> 18:08.654
because I only
have so much time.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.956
- So?
- So?

18:11.023 --> 18:12.558
How's your day
so far today?

18:12.624 --> 18:14.026
Ah, you made it really
good actually.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.127
- I did?
- Yeah.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.762
That's really sweet.

18:16.829 --> 18:17.763
Oh!

18:17.830 --> 18:21.200
I feel very grateful,
and excited, and happy

18:21.266 --> 18:24.970
because Karn is putting in
the effort to pursue me.

18:25.037 --> 18:27.072
And I don't even have to
really tell him to do it.

18:27.139 --> 18:28.273
He's just doing it.

18:28.340 --> 18:29.842
So, you look amazing.

18:29.908 --> 18:30.943
That's very sweet,
thank you.

18:31.009 --> 18:32.644
You're very welcome.

18:32.711 --> 18:34.146
But I don't want to beat
around the bush.

18:34.213 --> 18:37.516
I'm just gonna ask you,
how are you feeling?

18:37.583 --> 18:39.718
So, I was gonna talk
to you today.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.653
I feel like just me
as a person,

18:41.720 --> 18:43.755
it's really hard to
break through.

18:43.822 --> 18:46.024
Like, for me, like I just
started feeling like

18:46.091 --> 18:48.894
I like can relax and like
be myself so like,

18:48.961 --> 18:50.562
especially where
everyone's at.

18:50.629 --> 18:52.297
Yeah, well,
you shouldn't compare.

18:52.364 --> 18:55.267
I know, but it's really hard
to not compare because

18:55.334 --> 18:58.937
I'm really the only person
that's like not there.

18:59.004 --> 19:00.539
Like, I haven't kissed
anyone here or

19:00.606 --> 19:01.840
anything like that.
- Neither have I.

19:01.907 --> 19:03.642
- So...
- So, you're not alone.

19:03.709 --> 19:04.810
Don't worry.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.178
-
- We're in the same boat.

19:06.245 --> 19:09.581
Karn is extremely approachable.
He's super confident.

19:09.648 --> 19:12.217
And he goes for what
he wants, so like,

19:12.284 --> 19:14.686
if he's thinking something,
he'll just say it,

19:14.753 --> 19:16.755
which is pretty refreshing.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.156
It's like really hard to
have a connection

19:18.223 --> 19:20.626
with someone that
you just met.

19:20.692 --> 19:23.295
So, with you it's like, I think
you're really cool.

19:23.362 --> 19:24.963
I, I, like...

19:25.030 --> 19:26.965
I enjoy getting to know you.
I think you're really nice.

19:27.032 --> 19:30.135
I just want her to know what
my true intensions are.

19:30.202 --> 19:32.804
It's chill. Whatever you
end up doing, is all you.

19:32.871 --> 19:35.073
I just need to tell you that
this is how I'm feeling.

19:35.140 --> 19:36.775
I feel like I have a
connection with you and

19:36.842 --> 19:38.110
I'm hoping it's
reciprocated.

19:38.176 --> 19:39.711
And I just want to throw it
on the table, like,

19:39.778 --> 19:42.181
I definitely dig
your vibe and...

19:42.247 --> 19:43.815
Thank you, that's
really sweet.

19:43.882 --> 19:45.284
I think you're super cute.

19:45.350 --> 19:46.985
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:47.052 --> 19:48.887
Karn, I was wondering if I
could have just quick minute

19:48.954 --> 19:51.190
with Maria before we go
into the rose ceremony.

19:54.426 --> 19:55.794
We're going into the
last moments

19:55.861 --> 19:57.963
before the rose ceremony.
I don't want the

19:58.030 --> 20:00.132
last person Maria's
talking to, to be Karn.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.334
I want us to be able
to have a moment.

20:02.401 --> 20:04.369
- Go do your thing.
- Thank you for doing this.

20:04.436 --> 20:05.804
No worries.

20:05.871 --> 20:08.307
I know he set up this
nice date, but frankly,

20:08.373 --> 20:09.808
I don't give a shit.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.677
I'm going in there,
I'm breaking this up.

20:11.743 --> 20:13.111
And I'm taking my lady.

20:13.178 --> 20:16.348
And it's been, like, lovely
spending time with you too.

20:16.415 --> 20:18.050
I put it out there,
she knows it.

20:18.116 --> 20:20.852
And whether she decides to
give me her rose or not

20:20.919 --> 20:22.654
is completely up to her.

20:24.923 --> 20:26.658
Oh, Josh.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.333
I didn't want to waste
another second.

20:34.399 --> 20:36.335
I've had a few kisses
here in Paradise,

20:36.401 --> 20:39.271
but this is the one
that I wanted.

20:39.338 --> 20:41.106
I figured the spot where you
said no would be

20:41.173 --> 20:42.808
a good spot to say yes.

20:42.874 --> 20:45.177
- Ah, this is where I said no.
- Mhm.

20:45.243 --> 20:47.312
How many people have you
kissed in Paradise, Josh?

20:47.379 --> 20:49.781
-
- I don't, I- 3.

20:49.848 --> 20:51.216
3, wow!

20:51.283 --> 20:54.052
I understand that some
people are more open

20:54.119 --> 20:56.088
physically and
like romantically.

20:56.154 --> 20:58.223
I'm not so much.

20:58.290 --> 20:59.258
Are you the person
that has kissed

20:59.324 --> 21:00.959
the most people in Paradise?
- No, no, I'm not.

21:01.026 --> 21:02.260
What kind of guy
do you think I am?

21:02.327 --> 21:04.196
I don't know.

21:04.262 --> 21:05.964
I don't know if it's the
right moment.

21:06.031 --> 21:09.268
He's made out with like
quite a few girls.

21:09.334 --> 21:12.004
The experience that I went
through prior to the

21:12.070 --> 21:14.339
last rose ceremony
was quite draining.

21:14.406 --> 21:17.743
If the extra rose hadn't
happened, I wouldn't be here.

21:17.809 --> 21:19.711
So, I feel like a second choice.

21:24.049 --> 21:25.250
-
- Well, cheers.

21:25.317 --> 21:28.820
- Cheers to Paradise.
- Cheers to Paradise.

21:29.988 --> 21:31.757
It's quite the
adventure so far.

21:31.823 --> 21:33.692
There's a bug...

21:33.759 --> 21:35.294
It has been an adventure,
hasn't it?

21:35.360 --> 21:36.428
Mhm.

21:36.495 --> 21:37.596
It's the rose
ceremony tonight.

21:37.663 --> 21:40.766
I have the rose and, I think
it's pretty important that

21:40.832 --> 21:43.435
I talk to Mike just to make sure
that we're on the same page.

21:43.502 --> 21:46.471
So, did you have a
chance to think about

21:46.538 --> 21:48.473
our chat earlier
today or...?

21:48.540 --> 21:50.108
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

21:50.175 --> 21:51.176
Me too.

21:51.243 --> 21:53.111
Stacy, she's a
straight shooter.

21:53.178 --> 21:57.316
So, when I feel like I need to
talk about something,

21:57.382 --> 22:01.853
she's open to talking about
it and going deep.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.824
I think I'm ready to open up
to Stacy and let her know

22:05.891 --> 22:08.760
how I'm feeling and
what I want to do.

22:08.827 --> 22:10.762
Ah...

22:20.305 --> 22:22.441
I really like you a lot.

22:22.507 --> 22:24.443
And, I had a great experience.

22:24.509 --> 22:28.080
I met a gorgeous girl who has
an amazing personality.

22:28.146 --> 22:30.649
You don't even need to
continue with that...

22:30.716 --> 22:32.351
- Okay.
- ...sentence.

22:32.417 --> 22:33.919
I think he is just
talking at me.

22:33.985 --> 22:36.154
I think Mike's just saying
words to hope that

22:36.221 --> 22:37.122
they make sense.

22:37.189 --> 22:40.525
And they're really not
really landing with me.

22:40.592 --> 22:42.461
I was thinking more and
more about the rose and

22:42.527 --> 22:44.262
the significance of it.

22:44.329 --> 22:47.199
And as far as I'm concerned,
we're not quite at

22:47.265 --> 22:50.969
the level that this
rose deserves.

22:51.036 --> 22:55.006
Um...

22:55.073 --> 23:00.612
I wouldn't feel right about
accepting a rose from you.

23:00.679 --> 23:04.583
If I accept the rose,
I would be lying to you,

23:04.649 --> 23:07.018
and I'd be lying to myself.

23:07.085 --> 23:08.553
Um...

23:08.620 --> 23:10.088
What else could I have done?

23:10.155 --> 23:11.623
Like, what else could
I have done?

23:11.690 --> 23:13.959
You know, like, I was
patient with the guy.

23:14.025 --> 23:15.660
He went on dates with
other women.

23:15.727 --> 23:18.029
I think a lot of women probably
would've walked away from

23:18.096 --> 23:21.166
someone that was doing what
Mike kind of did to me.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.402
At this point, I think we
should maybe just like,

23:23.468 --> 23:25.270
just say our goodbyes.

23:25.337 --> 23:27.305
Okay.

23:27.372 --> 23:30.008
This is not easy for me.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.743
I did what I thought
was right because

23:31.810 --> 23:34.312
I care about her so much.

23:34.379 --> 23:37.215
My advice to the campers,
be real with yourself.

23:37.282 --> 23:41.086
Be genuine.
Life's too short.

23:41.153 --> 23:44.055
That's my advice.

23:44.122 --> 23:45.590
- Well...
- What's happening?

23:45.657 --> 23:48.360
Just wanted to say, like,
I'm gonna miss you guys.

23:48.426 --> 23:50.095
But I'm leaving Paradise.

23:50.162 --> 23:53.198
- I'm sorry?
- What?

23:53.265 --> 23:55.400
Mike said he wouldn't accept
my rose if I would...

23:55.467 --> 23:56.735
give it to him, so...

23:56.802 --> 24:00.639
Mike. Girl!
What in the world?

24:02.841 --> 24:03.775
I deserve love.

24:03.842 --> 24:05.610
I deserve someone that
knows what they want,

24:05.677 --> 24:07.712
and knows what they have
when they have it.

24:07.779 --> 24:13.118
I deserve someone that's going
to really try to get to know me.

24:13.185 --> 24:15.053
I'm not really
asking for a lot.

24:15.120 --> 24:17.589
I'm just asking for someone
to see me for who I am.

24:30.368 --> 24:31.436
Going into the rose ceremony
this week,

24:31.503 --> 24:35.440
the ladies have the power
and, it's the biggest one.

24:35.507 --> 24:37.542
This solidifies everything
leaving Paradise.

24:37.609 --> 24:40.312
This rose means we're taking
our relationships to the

24:40.378 --> 24:43.181
next level, and that's
very intimidating.

24:45.383 --> 24:46.551
Good evening, everyone.

24:46.618 --> 24:48.386
It's been an
interesting week.

24:48.453 --> 24:51.156
Existing connections
have been tested.

24:51.223 --> 24:54.559
And new relationships have
begun to blossom.

24:54.626 --> 24:57.696
And as we near the end of your
journey here in Paradise,

24:57.762 --> 25:03.802
these roses become that
much more important.

25:03.869 --> 25:07.272
Ladies, you'll be handing
out the roses this evening.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.308
I hope that each one comes
with deeper meaning,

25:10.375 --> 25:14.713
a symbol of love, happiness,
and your hopes for the future.

25:14.779 --> 25:17.516
Gentlemen, as you
receive the rose,

25:17.582 --> 25:21.753
I hope that the same feelings
remain true for you as well.

25:21.820 --> 25:26.725
Unfortunately, someone will be
leaving Paradise tonight.

25:29.694 --> 25:31.863
It's just me and Karn
vying for Maria's rose.

25:31.930 --> 25:33.365
I feel like I have
a good chance,

25:33.431 --> 25:35.267
but Karn did take her aside.

25:35.333 --> 25:36.801
They spoke for quite
a long time today.

25:36.868 --> 25:39.304
I don't know exactly
what's gonna happen.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.307
Fingers crossed.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.175
Let's get started.

25:44.242 --> 25:46.144
Angela.

25:52.651 --> 25:56.154
Brendan M.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.156
Angela and I are
falling in love.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.824
Our relationship is
constantly building,

25:59.891 --> 26:03.495
constantly growing and,
that's really what matters.

26:03.561 --> 26:08.166
Brendan, I am excited
to keep seeing

26:08.233 --> 26:09.834
where this journey takes us.

26:09.901 --> 26:13.204
And I wanted to know, will you
accept this rose?

26:13.271 --> 26:15.173
- Always.
- Always.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.309
- Looks good on you.
- Thank you.

26:20.879 --> 26:23.448
Kit.

26:28.753 --> 26:29.888
Alex...

26:29.955 --> 26:33.658
We've all been anticipating
Paradise to come to an end,

26:33.725 --> 26:39.597
but today, I'm just focused
on my journey here with Kit.

26:39.664 --> 26:41.232
Will you accept this rose?

26:41.299 --> 26:43.368
Gleefully.

26:45.804 --> 26:48.239
Lisa.

26:52.777 --> 26:53.745
Connor.

26:53.812 --> 26:56.681
I get super honest, genuine
vibes from Connor.

26:56.748 --> 26:58.216
I think he's such
a sweet guy,

26:58.283 --> 26:59.951
and I think he really is
here to find somebody.

27:00.018 --> 27:01.453
Will you accept this rose?

27:01.519 --> 27:03.655
Absolutely.

27:08.660 --> 27:12.764
Caitlin...

27:12.831 --> 27:17.502
Kamil and I have been having
communication issues.

27:17.569 --> 27:19.304
Kamil...

27:19.371 --> 27:22.340
But, he's my boyfriend and,
I'm hoping that we can

27:22.407 --> 27:25.276
both put in the work and
get through all of this.

27:25.343 --> 27:27.612
Kamil, will you
accept this rose?

27:27.679 --> 27:29.547
Yes.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.253
Thanks.

27:39.024 --> 27:41.626
Illeana.

27:44.029 --> 27:48.233
Today was probably the most
stressed out I've seen Illeana.

27:48.299 --> 27:49.834
Everyone's looking at us
thinking we're the

27:49.901 --> 27:51.369
happy go lucky couple that,

27:51.436 --> 27:53.405
that's just gonna run off
into the sunset.

27:53.471 --> 27:56.441
But, we are human beings.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.343
Brendan S.

28:01.079 --> 28:03.548
Brendan, will you
accept this rose?

28:03.615 --> 28:04.582
Absolutely.

28:19.664 --> 28:24.002
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
the final rose for the evening.

28:26.104 --> 28:27.539
At this point, I don't know
what's gonna happen.

28:27.605 --> 28:28.973
I'm at peace
with being here.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.276
I've really enjoyed my time.
That being said,

28:31.342 --> 28:32.377
I've met a pretty
incredible girl in the

28:32.444 --> 28:35.313
last couple days and, that's
the only rose I want.

28:35.380 --> 28:39.784
Maria...

28:39.851 --> 28:41.820
I feel good, I feel confident.

28:41.886 --> 28:44.355
But, whatever happens, happens.

28:50.395 --> 28:52.597
At the end of the day, I put it
all out on the table.

28:52.664 --> 28:54.566
And that's, that's all you
can really do.

28:58.703 --> 29:00.405
Josh...

29:05.743 --> 29:08.413
Josh, will you
accept this rose?

29:08.480 --> 29:10.782
- Absolutely.
- Okay.

29:15.753 --> 29:19.424
I decide to give my rose to
Josh because I feel like the

29:19.491 --> 29:21.860
more I get to know Josh,
the more I like him.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.094
It is absolutely a
connection that

29:23.161 --> 29:24.662
I'm interested in exploring.

29:24.729 --> 29:30.001
Karn, it's time to say
your goodbyes.

29:30.068 --> 29:31.936
- Pleasure, man.
- Nice meeting you.

29:32.003 --> 29:33.438
I do not have any regrets.

29:33.505 --> 29:36.741
I think I did
everything I could.

29:36.808 --> 29:39.911
I think I was
completely myself.

29:39.978 --> 29:42.881
I took those shots
and I missed.

29:42.947 --> 29:46.951
Still took the shots.
Maria, you up.

29:50.688 --> 29:51.756
<i>Coming up...</i>

29:51.823 --> 29:53.892
Whoa, Jesse's here!

29:53.958 --> 29:57.996
Today is the day that
everything in Paradise changes.

29:58.062 --> 29:59.030
Something's going down,

29:59.097 --> 30:01.699
and I can definitely feel
the stress in the air.

30:01.766 --> 30:04.435
The next phase,
fantasy suites.

30:04.502 --> 30:06.070
Now that we're getting
closer to the end,

30:06.137 --> 30:07.772
it's a little bit more real.

30:07.839 --> 30:09.474
I don't know if I'm
ready for this.

30:09.541 --> 30:10.341
We're here and I think

30:10.408 --> 30:12.043
we're both probably on
the same page.

30:12.110 --> 30:14.846
It could work. Could also
be a disaster.

30:14.913 --> 30:16.447
I'm excited to find out.

30:23.521 --> 30:24.756
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:24.823 --> 30:27.058
- Hello, men.
- Hey, how we doing?

30:27.125 --> 30:28.526
This is interesting.

30:28.593 --> 30:29.961
Welcome to my office.

30:30.028 --> 30:31.162
It's a new day in Paradise.

30:31.229 --> 30:32.931
We had a rose
ceremony last night.

30:32.997 --> 30:34.599
And now we're left
with 6 couples.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.569
Paradise is always full of
surprises, and, at this point,

30:37.635 --> 30:39.103
I don't know what's
gonna happen.

30:39.170 --> 30:42.106
Wouldn't it be so crazy if right
now someone new came in?

30:42.173 --> 30:44.876
I would turn right back around
if I walked into this.

30:51.049 --> 30:52.250
I can't believe it.

30:52.317 --> 30:54.619
I can't believe
we're still here.

30:54.686 --> 30:55.820
- I know.
- And...

30:55.887 --> 30:56.788
Who would 'a thought?

30:56.855 --> 31:00.258
Today I woke up feeling
really excited to keep

31:00.325 --> 31:03.094
exploring my relationship
with Brendan M.

31:03.161 --> 31:05.630
Brendan M. and I are
growing every day.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.966
We have a great foundation,
but there's definitely

31:08.032 --> 31:10.101
more conversations
to be had.

31:10.168 --> 31:12.770
I know you are...

31:12.837 --> 31:14.606
really feeling good.

31:14.672 --> 31:17.141
I'm feeling, I'm feeling
really, really happy right now.

31:17.208 --> 31:20.678
It's ironic that you and I kind
of like swapped scenarios

31:20.745 --> 31:23.514
because for Brendan M. and I
it was like rocky, rocky,

31:23.581 --> 31:25.149
smooth, smooth,
rocky, rocky.

31:25.216 --> 31:27.885
Now Brendan M. and I are kind
of on a flat surface and

31:27.952 --> 31:29.654
I know you're having...

31:29.721 --> 31:31.256
a struggle here and there and...
- Yeah.

31:31.322 --> 31:35.026
As we just get closer to the
end, you know, my...

31:35.093 --> 31:36.761
my head starting to kick in.

31:36.828 --> 31:39.697
Brendan S. and I haven't
really had any of those

31:39.764 --> 31:41.766
conversations where we have
needed to challenge

31:41.833 --> 31:44.602
one another's emotional
intelligence until now.

31:44.669 --> 31:48.640
And it's only becoming more
revealing to me now how big

31:48.706 --> 31:51.643
of a difference there might
be between the way that

31:51.709 --> 31:54.012
we comprehend and
understand things,

31:54.078 --> 31:57.081
and I think that's why
I'm getting nervous.

31:57.148 --> 31:59.917
They're normal concerns,
right, and doubts

31:59.984 --> 32:02.186
just because I don't know how
this is gonna necessarily

32:02.253 --> 32:06.758
translate into
the real world.

32:06.824 --> 32:09.160
Illeana and I, we've taken
off so quickly and we,

32:09.227 --> 32:10.328
we got what we wanted.

32:10.395 --> 32:11.262
We've communicated
really well.

32:11.329 --> 32:14.632
I've been so open here
with Illeana and,

32:14.699 --> 32:16.768
I think we're always
on the same page.

32:16.834 --> 32:19.203
You know, we can both go home
feeling very happy about it.

32:19.270 --> 32:21.940
Illeana has been off the
last couple days,

32:22.006 --> 32:24.242
at this stage in Paradise,

32:24.309 --> 32:28.079
but I don't really care how
tough the road is.

32:28.146 --> 32:30.581
I just want to be on the same
page leaving Paradise and,

32:30.648 --> 32:32.083
making it work in
the outside world.

32:32.150 --> 32:33.885
Our connection and our
feelings for each other,

32:33.951 --> 32:36.688
I know those won't change and
I'm not worried about it.

32:36.754 --> 32:39.357
But, let's transition
smoothly into reality.

32:39.424 --> 32:40.191
It's scary, man.

32:40.258 --> 32:42.060
It's scary leaving here
and, you know,

32:42.126 --> 32:43.795
I already had a
failed relationship

32:43.861 --> 32:45.029
coming out of Paradise.

32:45.096 --> 32:46.764
- You don't want to repeat it.
- I don't want to repeat it.

32:46.831 --> 32:48.666
And that's why I'm trying
to do, you know,

32:48.733 --> 32:52.770
things differently with
Caitlin at this moment.

32:52.837 --> 32:55.139
I just want to make sure
that like Caitlin

32:55.206 --> 32:57.775
didn't just get
like strung along.

32:57.842 --> 32:59.711
Did he do the most that he
could to make her

32:59.777 --> 33:01.245
feel special and make
her feel wanted?

33:01.312 --> 33:03.047
And I feel like that's been
like a common like

33:03.114 --> 33:04.816
theme with them.

33:04.882 --> 33:09.120
I know the past with Kamil.
I was there for it.

33:09.187 --> 33:11.255
I didn't love how he
treated my friend.

33:11.322 --> 33:13.324
You know, he blindsided her.

33:13.391 --> 33:15.393
Is he just coasting through
this and then gonna like

33:15.460 --> 33:17.762
dump Caitlin as
soon as he leaves?

33:17.829 --> 33:20.832
I do think he's been pretty
lazy through this process.

33:20.898 --> 33:22.233
And so, it's like, Kamil,

33:22.300 --> 33:24.836
this is you seeing Caitlin
every single day.

33:24.902 --> 33:26.404
Like, what's gonna happen
now that you have

33:26.471 --> 33:31.109
distance as a barrier?
Are you gonna put in the work?

33:31.175 --> 33:33.277
She's definitely given this
relationship every-

33:33.344 --> 33:35.213
- Every single ounce...
- ...everything in her.

33:35.279 --> 33:36.914
..of her energy.

33:36.981 --> 33:39.050
I'm not trying to like
rag on them,

33:39.117 --> 33:41.252
but do I think he is her
forever person?

33:41.319 --> 33:42.954
I don't.

33:49.193 --> 33:51.162
- Whoa, Jesse's here!
- Hello.

33:51.229 --> 33:52.897
- How you guys doing?
- Hey!

33:52.964 --> 33:54.098
Join us over here.

33:54.165 --> 33:56.167
Come on over here by
the Muskoka chairs.

33:56.234 --> 33:58.970
Jesse walks in and,
immediately I'm thinking,

33:59.037 --> 34:01.873
either somebody new is
coming in or we gotta make

34:01.939 --> 34:04.008
some pretty big
decisions today.

34:04.075 --> 34:07.145
Good, good.

34:07.211 --> 34:09.947
Jesse's here and
he's never here

34:10.014 --> 34:11.349
the morning after a
rose ceremony.

34:11.416 --> 34:13.084
And that means
there's trouble.

34:13.151 --> 34:16.354
It's nice to see everyone so
relaxed and happy.

34:16.421 --> 34:19.323
Well, I'm here to
shake things up.

34:21.793 --> 34:23.728
Something's going down
and I can definitely

34:23.795 --> 34:25.196
feel the stress in the air.

34:25.263 --> 34:31.335
Today is the day that
everything in Paradise changes.

34:31.402 --> 34:35.373
Last night was your
last rose ceremony.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.742
That means the next phase,

34:37.809 --> 34:41.112
overnight dates in
the fantasy suites.

34:41.179 --> 34:42.713
I think a lot of people
here are hesitant

34:42.780 --> 34:44.282
about fantasy suites.

34:46.417 --> 34:47.351
Brendan M. and Angela.

34:47.418 --> 34:49.320
That situation seems very
straight forward.

34:49.387 --> 34:50.955
That being said, I can
definitely see

34:51.022 --> 34:52.457
a little bit of doubt in
Brendan's eyes.

34:52.523 --> 34:54.492
When you meet someone
so fast, so soon,

34:54.559 --> 34:55.526
you're gonna have
doubt no matter what.

34:55.593 --> 34:59.163
So, it could work.
It could also be a disaster.

34:59.230 --> 35:00.932
I'm excited to find out.

35:00.998 --> 35:02.767
Now, this will give you an
opportunity to get a little

35:02.834 --> 35:07.004
closer and explore the next
phase of your relationships.

35:07.071 --> 35:10.241
Now, the fantasy suites and
entering into them together

35:10.308 --> 35:12.376
is nothing to be
taken lightly.

35:12.443 --> 35:15.813
This decision is for couples
who are looking to explore

35:15.880 --> 35:18.216
where they've been and take
things from what's happened

35:18.282 --> 35:22.753
here on the beach to a more
real world, committed situation.

35:22.820 --> 35:25.389
Every aspect of the fantasy
suite is important.

35:25.456 --> 35:28.292
Having the alone time, getting
to chat one on one,

35:28.359 --> 35:31.229
having some time
for intimacy.

35:31.295 --> 35:34.198
You should be open to
something longer term.

35:34.265 --> 35:37.101
And perhaps,
even a proposal.

35:37.168 --> 35:39.837
While he's talking, my head
kind of just starts

35:39.904 --> 35:42.473
running a million
miles a minute.

35:42.540 --> 35:46.410
I don't know if I'm
ready for this.

35:46.477 --> 35:50.114
I could see a proposal.
I mean, anything could happen.

35:50.181 --> 35:53.451
So, these are the conversations
you'll have to be having.

35:53.518 --> 35:56.153
And you'll have to be
crystal clear about

35:56.220 --> 35:59.190
your intentions and
your feelings.

35:59.257 --> 36:01.025
It's an opportunity for
you to be honest,

36:01.092 --> 36:03.928
not just with yourself,
but with your partner.

36:03.995 --> 36:07.999
And take this as the last
opportunity to figure out

36:08.065 --> 36:11.802
if you're both really looking to
take things to the next level.

36:11.869 --> 36:15.506
Because if not,
you and your partner

36:15.573 --> 36:19.010
will be heading home from
Camp Paradise...

36:19.076 --> 36:20.945
today.

36:23.114 --> 36:29.020
Today's the day that
everything in Paradise changes.

36:29.086 --> 36:31.589
Enjoy your conversations.

36:31.656 --> 36:34.458
And leave your heart out there
with each other.

36:34.525 --> 36:38.396
Good luck.

36:38.462 --> 36:41.499
Today's gonna be a huge day
for a lot of people.

36:41.566 --> 36:43.534
I feel like there's gonna be
break ups.

36:43.601 --> 36:46.270
It's been a rollercoaster of
emotions of the happy,

36:46.337 --> 36:50.908
and the sad, drama, and the
tears and the romance-

36:50.975 --> 36:53.177
that's all coming to an end.
It's crazy.

37:01.552 --> 37:05.423
Today's the day that
everything in Paradise changes.

37:05.489 --> 37:08.059
Enjoy your conversations.

37:08.125 --> 37:12.263
And leave your heart out there
with each other. Alright?

37:12.330 --> 37:14.665
- Thanks, Jesse.
- Good luck.

37:14.732 --> 37:17.335
Having Jesse come in and
drop that bomb on us,

37:17.401 --> 37:20.137
it definitely puts some
things in perspective.

37:20.204 --> 37:23.541
We all know we have to have
these difficult conversations.

37:23.608 --> 37:25.476
You know, decisions
need to be made.

37:29.380 --> 37:30.548
It's kind of nice now.

37:30.615 --> 37:32.350
This would have been a
really nice beach day.

37:32.416 --> 37:34.685
I never thought I
would see myself

37:34.752 --> 37:36.420
near the very
end of Paradise.

37:36.487 --> 37:38.589
Every day felt like
an uphill battle.

37:38.656 --> 37:40.091
I'm honestly
shocked at how this

37:40.157 --> 37:41.826
whole thing
turned out for me.

37:41.892 --> 37:43.794
So, you've had a really
short journey.

37:43.861 --> 37:45.796
I've had a really
rocky journey.

37:45.863 --> 37:47.732
I started here really hopeful.

37:47.798 --> 37:50.601
Unfortunately, for me,
I just had a lot of drama

37:50.668 --> 37:53.137
and like, it just
never felt right.

37:53.204 --> 37:55.473
And then you came in and
like, it was just so instant

37:55.539 --> 37:56.841
and like comfortable
and natural.

37:56.907 --> 37:57.908
And like, the moment you
came in was like

37:57.975 --> 38:01.712
when I feel like Paradise
finally began for me.

38:01.779 --> 38:03.748
Sitting down with Connor,
I just want to express

38:03.814 --> 38:05.483
how happy I am to
have met him.

38:05.549 --> 38:07.785
He showed me I can really
feel attraction and

38:07.852 --> 38:09.520
romance towards
somebody again.

38:09.587 --> 38:12.623
I felt like super fortunate to
have had the situation that

38:12.690 --> 38:15.326
I did, and that you were even
available when I got here.

38:15.393 --> 38:17.161
And especially like
on that first day

38:17.228 --> 38:18.796
where I felt so overwhelmed.

38:18.863 --> 38:21.298
I kind of felt like I was
always able to lean on you.

38:21.365 --> 38:23.501
I've enjoyed every minute
I've had with Lisa.

38:23.567 --> 38:25.269
The time that I have
had here with her

38:25.336 --> 38:27.405
has been an
amazing adventure.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.246
A lot of us have been here
since the beginning.

38:35.313 --> 38:38.416
And, it's surreal to realize
that Paradise is

38:38.482 --> 38:40.751
coming to an end.

38:40.818 --> 38:42.153
So, how you feeling?

38:42.219 --> 38:43.287
I'm feeling good.

38:43.354 --> 38:44.889
- Yeah?
- Super good, actually.

38:44.955 --> 38:48.492
We have had more than
one obstacle and,

38:48.559 --> 38:51.162
every single time,
we always fight through it.

38:51.228 --> 38:52.630
Yes, we work in this bubble,

38:52.697 --> 38:55.800
but I feel like we'll also
work in the real world too.

38:55.866 --> 38:57.868
My connection with
Brendan M. is amazing.

38:57.935 --> 38:59.370
It's the best
it's ever been.

38:59.437 --> 39:01.272
Each day we get stronger.

39:01.338 --> 39:02.673
I feel really confident
in where

39:02.740 --> 39:04.475
Brendan M. and
I are right now.

39:04.542 --> 39:07.611
Being able to have that
communication and that trust

39:07.678 --> 39:11.182
and that understanding,
I think it just puts us at

39:11.248 --> 39:13.217
that much more
of an advantage.

39:13.284 --> 39:16.287
When I spend time with Angela,
I feel happy.

39:16.353 --> 39:20.491
She's just so open.
It just feels right.

39:20.558 --> 39:23.194
What do you think about
going to fantasy suite?

39:23.260 --> 39:25.796
There are a lot of
implications tied to it.

39:25.863 --> 39:28.265
And added pressure,
I guess...

39:28.332 --> 39:30.267
- Yeah, and assumptions.
- Yeah...

39:30.334 --> 39:32.837
And I don't necessarily
think that

39:32.903 --> 39:35.740
we need to apply that
pressure to us.

39:35.806 --> 39:37.508
No, I agree.

39:37.575 --> 39:39.610
We just, we won't do
fantasy suite then.

39:39.677 --> 39:41.579
Me and Connor might not be
leaving together,

39:41.645 --> 39:43.614
but I can say that our
relationship seems

39:43.681 --> 39:46.283
a lot more legit than
some others in here.

39:46.350 --> 39:49.253
Just because camp is over
doesn't mean that like,

39:49.320 --> 39:50.921
we can't figure it out
outside of camp

39:50.988 --> 39:52.857
́cause I had a
really good time.

39:52.923 --> 39:53.924
Me too.

39:53.991 --> 39:57.228
The biggest thing I learned
in Paradise is that

39:57.294 --> 40:00.598
you gotta hold on and
good things will come.

40:04.635 --> 40:06.337
See you soon, okay?

40:13.844 --> 40:15.846
This thing called fantasy is
coming up, you know?

40:15.913 --> 40:17.448
Yeah, yeah!

40:17.515 --> 40:18.949
What's going on in
your head about that?

40:19.016 --> 40:21.418
Like, where do you stand?
How do you feel?

40:21.485 --> 40:22.920
I think it would be,
obviously,

40:22.987 --> 40:26.690
like dumb of us to not
use that time to...

40:26.757 --> 40:29.560
keep figuring things out and,
brush our teeth together and

40:29.627 --> 40:31.996
like, do like normal,
you know, like-

40:32.062 --> 40:34.231
Normal things? It's kind
of a glimpse of what-

40:34.298 --> 40:35.366
Yeah!

40:35.432 --> 40:38.803
I'm feeling confident about
going into fantasy suite

40:38.869 --> 40:42.807
because it is kind of a small
taste of, of real life.

40:42.873 --> 40:45.476
What about you?
What are you thinking?

40:45.543 --> 40:47.545
No, I'm in the
same boat as you.

40:47.611 --> 40:48.979
I'm looking forward to it.

40:49.046 --> 40:52.550
I never expected to meet
someone quite like you.

40:52.616 --> 40:53.918
It really is a blessing.

40:53.984 --> 40:56.720
And, I just look forward to,
to the future.

40:56.787 --> 40:58.456
I feel just at ease.

40:58.522 --> 41:00.291
You know, this is right,
makes sense.

41:03.427 --> 41:06.664
What Brendan M. and I
have is literally like just

41:06.730 --> 41:08.666
different than anything
I've ever felt ever.

41:08.732 --> 41:11.569
I feel so comfortable
with him. I'm good.

41:11.635 --> 41:13.471
I'm Gucci, baby.

41:27.885 --> 41:29.653
Illeana's been overthinking
a little bit in the last

41:29.720 --> 41:31.655
couple days and, I'm a
little high strung today.

41:31.722 --> 41:33.891
I think the scariest part
is the unknown.

41:36.460 --> 41:38.395
I'm a bit impatient for
this conversation.

41:38.462 --> 41:40.331
I want to know where Kit is at.

41:40.397 --> 41:42.766
She can only say
one of two things.

41:42.833 --> 41:44.768
It's either she wants to
continue exploring things

41:44.835 --> 41:47.872
with me or she doesn't.

41:47.938 --> 41:49.006
How do you feel?

41:49.073 --> 41:51.008
I know you were confused
yesterday a little bit and,

41:51.075 --> 41:52.142
just want to make
sure you're okay.

41:52.209 --> 41:56.013
I mean, I think the whole
time that we've been here,

41:56.080 --> 41:58.682
it's been all
smiles and easy.

41:58.749 --> 42:00.484
But now that we're getting
closer to the end,

42:00.551 --> 42:02.386
it's a little bit more real.

42:02.453 --> 42:04.688
Brendan S. and I have been

42:04.755 --> 42:06.824
focused on each
other since day one.

42:06.891 --> 42:08.492
It's a bit scary
because I feel like

42:08.559 --> 42:13.097
I went from zero to 100
really quick.

42:13.163 --> 42:15.566
And, I think it's
because I didn't

42:15.633 --> 42:17.368
have to think about
the real world.

42:17.434 --> 42:21.071
So, the reality of everything
is kind of kicking in right now.

42:21.138 --> 42:22.940
My head's starting to work
a little bit and I'm just

42:23.007 --> 42:28.646
wondering how this translates
into the outside world.

42:28.712 --> 42:30.381
What do you want to do?

42:30.447 --> 42:31.582
I don't know,
it's a loaded question.

42:31.649 --> 42:32.917
I mean, this very moment,

42:32.983 --> 42:34.685
I don't know if you're
thinking fantasy.

42:34.752 --> 42:37.021
I don't know where
you're at for that.

42:37.087 --> 42:39.924
No, so, where are you at?
That's what I'm asking.

42:39.990 --> 42:41.892
Being put on the spot
about what I want,

42:41.959 --> 42:43.761
I don't like those
questions, you know,

42:43.827 --> 42:46.864
to be honest. I just want
Illeana to be happy.

42:46.931 --> 42:49.099
He always just says he
wants me to be happy.

42:49.166 --> 42:51.669
And I'm genuinely curious
like, what he wants and

42:51.735 --> 42:53.037
what would make him happy,

42:53.103 --> 42:56.073
but I've never quite
gotten that answer.

42:56.140 --> 42:57.474
Obviously,
in a perfect world,

42:57.541 --> 42:58.976
I want to walk out of
here with you.

42:59.043 --> 43:01.078
No matter how it ends
for us, I don't care.

43:01.145 --> 43:03.480
I just really do want to try it
in the outside world.

43:10.187 --> 43:12.656
What a crazy
journey it's been.

43:12.723 --> 43:14.091
It has.

43:14.158 --> 43:16.627
Obviously, I came in...

43:16.694 --> 43:18.662
and, by sheer luck,

43:18.729 --> 43:20.864
somehow I picked
the optimum date.

43:20.931 --> 43:23.500
And I could not be
more thrilled and

43:23.567 --> 43:25.002
thankful for that choice.

43:25.069 --> 43:28.839
Probably the only good choice
I made out here.

43:28.906 --> 43:32.142
My biggest goal for today
is to really

43:32.209 --> 43:34.078
understand where Kit is at.

43:34.144 --> 43:37.014
I do feel great about where
we are in our connection,

43:37.081 --> 43:38.849
but I think she's
holding out on me.

43:38.916 --> 43:42.019
I know how much I like her.
I know what I want to do.

43:42.086 --> 43:43.887
I just need to hear it from her.

43:43.954 --> 43:45.923
When we first met and
after our first date,

43:45.990 --> 43:48.892
I wasn't sure that I would
ever let my guard down.

43:48.959 --> 43:51.462
I feel like I've grown
a lot and,

43:51.528 --> 43:53.430
through all of that
in Paradise,

43:53.497 --> 43:55.632
you've just been there.

43:55.699 --> 44:00.738
The realization that I have
come to is that in order for me

44:00.804 --> 44:03.941
to be able to be a partner
that you deserve,

44:04.008 --> 44:09.646
that I need to love myself more
and be stronger on my own.

44:09.713 --> 44:13.150
And, to do what I think is like
the best for both of us,

44:13.217 --> 44:15.219
is to leave here apart.

44:17.955 --> 44:20.791
Obviously, Alex is someone I
care for very deeply and,

44:20.858 --> 44:22.226
even though it's
the right decision,

44:22.292 --> 44:24.495
it doesn't make it an
easy one to make.

44:24.561 --> 44:28.966
I won't sit here and say I'm
not disappointed to hear that.

44:29.033 --> 44:32.836
I have so much appreciation
for the time you've given me.

44:32.903 --> 44:34.772
And I will do my best
to understand

44:34.838 --> 44:35.939
where you're coming from.

44:36.006 --> 44:38.942
I couldn't be more thankful
to Kit for being here and

44:39.009 --> 44:42.513
making this one of the most
beautiful experiences

44:42.579 --> 44:44.114
I've ever been through.

44:46.583 --> 44:47.985
I have no regrets.

44:48.052 --> 44:51.188
I'm happy with everything
that I did and said here.

44:51.255 --> 44:54.558
I'm happy I got to know such
an incredible woman.

45:00.330 --> 45:02.699
I've met so many
amazing people and

45:02.766 --> 45:04.768
I've learned so
much about myself and,

45:04.835 --> 45:07.171
I'm so grateful
that I got to be here.

45:11.775 --> 45:14.278
I honestly am more concerned
about the fact that

45:14.344 --> 45:18.015
I don't know anything about
your day-to-day life.

45:18.082 --> 45:20.084
I don't think I could figure
that out tonight.

45:20.150 --> 45:23.053
It's more like, you coming
to visit me in New York and

45:23.120 --> 45:26.223
seeing my friends and,
me coming to Toronto.

45:26.290 --> 45:29.093
Just like seeing how we mesh
in the outside world.

45:29.159 --> 45:31.295
Like, that would give me
the clarity I need.

45:31.361 --> 45:32.830
I mean, we're always
on the same page.

45:32.896 --> 45:33.931
Yeah.

45:33.997 --> 45:35.265
"We're always on
the same page."

45:35.332 --> 45:38.135
I just don't think we are.

45:38.202 --> 45:40.571
I do want to go to the
fantasy suites with you.

45:40.637 --> 45:42.306
I think we'll take that
next leap together.

45:42.372 --> 45:43.373
You mean the world to me.

45:43.440 --> 45:46.110
You've been my rock through
thick and thin here.

45:46.176 --> 45:50.247
I just don't want to go into
the fantasy suite under the

45:50.314 --> 45:54.051
notion that that means that
we're 100% walking out of here.

45:54.118 --> 45:56.854
So, I'll go if we're on
the same page.

45:56.920 --> 45:59.189
I should be, like,
excited about it.

45:59.256 --> 46:02.593
And I just don't
know if I am.

46:02.659 --> 46:05.095
I think I'm more
stressed about it.

46:05.162 --> 46:08.198
I don't want to create this
unrealistic expectation and

46:08.265 --> 46:09.967
make it seem like
everything's gonna be

46:10.033 --> 46:12.870
perfectly fine
after this night.

46:12.936 --> 46:15.172
Difficult conversations
need to be had.

46:25.382 --> 46:29.286
For me, the fantasy suite
means extra alone time with

46:29.353 --> 46:32.723
my boyfriend and,
I think that's crucial.

46:32.789 --> 46:37.194
Kamil's hesitation is based
on his past experiences.

46:37.261 --> 46:41.031
And that's frustrating for
me because if he's gonna let

46:41.098 --> 46:43.200
the past affect the present,
there won't be

46:43.267 --> 46:45.936
any room for growth
between him and I.

46:46.003 --> 46:47.804
You know, we've been
through our fair share

46:47.871 --> 46:49.506
of turmoil here, but...

46:49.573 --> 46:51.508
I think I've told you several
times I couldn't have

46:51.575 --> 46:54.278
seen myself being here
with anyone else.

46:54.344 --> 46:57.181
Going into the
fantasy suite solidifies

46:57.247 --> 46:58.916
a lot for our relationship.

46:58.982 --> 47:01.752
And if we don't go,
it kind of means that

47:01.818 --> 47:04.054
we're separating and, you know,
I'm going back to New York,

47:04.121 --> 47:06.323
she's going back to Toronto.
And who knows what could happen.

47:06.390 --> 47:09.092
I really want to go to the
fantasy suites with you and

47:09.159 --> 47:10.394
have that time alone.

47:10.460 --> 47:13.397
Seeing if this is gonna work
for both of us and,

47:13.463 --> 47:15.432
we'll get a chance to talk.

47:20.103 --> 47:21.939
My heart's beating because
Maria and I are

47:22.005 --> 47:23.407
so recent and so new.

47:23.473 --> 47:26.176
I just want more time,
but I don't have it.

47:26.243 --> 47:29.213
And now, we have to make a
really tough decision.

47:29.279 --> 47:31.515
It was a bit of a ride, eh,
that we had.

47:31.582 --> 47:33.517
Yeah, it started like this and
then it just went here and

47:33.584 --> 47:36.053
now it's like,
where's it gonna go?

47:36.119 --> 47:37.955
Yeah, that's a
good question.

47:38.021 --> 47:41.158
It was great for me to come in
here and find a connection just

47:41.225 --> 47:43.493
because I was a
little bit hesitant.

47:43.560 --> 47:45.362
It really surprised me.

47:45.429 --> 47:47.364
I mean, we had the talent show.

47:47.431 --> 47:50.167
We spoke very briefly, but I
was really glad that

47:50.234 --> 47:51.802
we had the chance to
speak that night.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.438
When Maria arrived,
something real happened.

47:54.504 --> 47:55.873
I met someone that
I could actually

47:55.939 --> 47:57.241
see myself with
outside of here.

47:57.307 --> 47:59.276
She's classy, she's beautiful.

47:59.343 --> 48:01.411
Every moment just feels like
I'm talking to someone

48:01.478 --> 48:04.581
I've known my whole life and,
it's tough, man, like...

48:04.648 --> 48:06.350
I don't know, I don't
meet people like that

48:06.416 --> 48:07.818
very often, you know.

48:07.885 --> 48:09.286
You showed up so
close to the end.

48:09.353 --> 48:11.455
I'm sorry I couldn't
be here sooner.

48:11.521 --> 48:14.258
- Definitely not your fault.
- No, I'm really glad I came.

48:14.324 --> 48:16.126
I'm really happy that
it ended up

48:16.193 --> 48:18.061
working out like
the way it did.

48:18.128 --> 48:19.930
I agree.

48:19.997 --> 48:21.832
What are you thinking
about tonight?

48:21.898 --> 48:25.269
Um...

48:25.335 --> 48:29.373
So, I feel like tonight
would be a...

48:29.439 --> 48:32.142
a great night to spend together.

48:32.209 --> 48:33.343
Yeah?

48:33.410 --> 48:36.580
I want to talk about, like,
the future and it will like

48:36.647 --> 48:39.216
give us also time to like make
a plan outside of this,

48:39.283 --> 48:40.183
which will be nice.

48:40.250 --> 48:43.053
Today it seems like
he's had this epiphany.

48:43.120 --> 48:45.956
Now, all of a sudden, he wants
to go to fantasy suites.

48:46.023 --> 48:49.126
So, I'm kind of
uneasy about it all.

48:49.192 --> 48:52.029
I guess I'm just curious
what kind of shifted and

48:52.095 --> 48:55.098
why you're more open to going
to the fantasy suites now.

48:55.165 --> 48:58.635
My past experience, it was kind
of like traumatic for me.

48:58.702 --> 49:00.637
And I wanted to, you know,

49:00.704 --> 49:03.106
move forward with you
because you're different.

49:03.173 --> 49:06.109
The realization that I came to
is, the past is the past and,

49:06.176 --> 49:08.145
Caitlin, she's a new person,
new future.

49:08.211 --> 49:09.212
That's where I want to head.

49:09.279 --> 49:13.116
I don't want to
dwell on the past.

49:13.183 --> 49:17.120
We're here and I think we're
both probably on the same page.

49:17.187 --> 49:20.223
The speed that we'd
have to move, it was,

49:20.290 --> 49:22.893
it'd be a bit rushed.

49:22.960 --> 49:25.362
So...

49:25.429 --> 49:28.165
I guess that means no
on the fantasy suite.

49:28.231 --> 49:30.267
It's best that we head off
in our separate directions

49:30.334 --> 49:31.635
at this point.

49:31.702 --> 49:33.036
But with a great friendship.

49:33.103 --> 49:34.471
- Yeah.
-

49:34.538 --> 49:36.139
Right now, it feels like
the best decision.

49:36.206 --> 49:37.641
It's just too soon.

49:37.708 --> 49:38.909
And Maria's definitely
someone I could

49:38.976 --> 49:40.344
see myself with
outside of this.

49:40.410 --> 49:42.646
And, that's what makes
this so difficult.

49:42.713 --> 49:44.548
That's the first time I felt
this way during this experience

49:44.614 --> 49:47.317
and it's really, really hard
to turn the other way

49:47.384 --> 49:50.053
to something like that.

49:50.120 --> 49:53.924
I don't know what the future has
in store for me and Josh.

49:53.990 --> 49:57.160
I think that the connection
that we built is great.

49:57.227 --> 50:00.530
So, if we were to find each
other in the same place,

50:00.597 --> 50:04.401
at the same time, hopefully,
we can see that still there.

50:08.171 --> 50:11.508
I want to make you happy, and I
feel like we do need that time.

50:11.575 --> 50:15.512
Mhm. I just wanted to make sure
that this something that,

50:15.579 --> 50:17.180
you know, we want
to do together.

50:17.247 --> 50:19.182
And, we'll have some time to
talk about communication this

50:19.249 --> 50:22.986
evening 'cause, I mean, I know
you're trying, and I know,

50:23.053 --> 50:24.388
like, you're doing
so much better.

50:24.454 --> 50:27.224
But, I think that's our
weakest point and

50:27.290 --> 50:29.726
we'll just have to keep
putting in the work to...

50:29.793 --> 50:33.130
try and understand each other's
communication styles.

50:33.196 --> 50:36.566
This is just one more step
in our chapter here.

50:36.633 --> 50:39.136
All I can do is hope tonight
we'll get all of the answers

50:39.202 --> 50:42.139
we need to any questions that
still haven't been asked.

50:42.205 --> 50:44.408
And feel strong
enough to continue

50:44.474 --> 50:47.978
this relationship
outside of here.

50:48.045 --> 50:49.346
I honestly didn't think
you were gonna

50:49.413 --> 50:51.214
change your tune on that.

50:51.281 --> 50:53.083
I said we're leaving today.

50:53.150 --> 50:54.584
What? Kamil!

51:03.226 --> 51:07.297
I'm feeling confident about
going into fantasy suites.

51:07.364 --> 51:09.065
I've never done
one before because

51:09.132 --> 51:11.635
I've never felt ready in
my past seasons.

51:11.701 --> 51:13.737
But I feel so
comfortable with him.

51:13.804 --> 51:16.339
I trust him. He trusts me.

51:16.406 --> 51:18.041
So, I've been planning this
for a minute,

51:18.108 --> 51:19.709
but I haven't been able to
do it until now.

51:19.776 --> 51:22.612
We made it through all the ups
and downs of Paradise.

51:22.679 --> 51:26.416
I wanted to take a little walk
through memory lane with you.

51:26.483 --> 51:30.754
I'm very excited to just have
more time to spend with him and

51:30.821 --> 51:35.325
my little surprise walk down
memory lane, you know,

51:35.392 --> 51:37.761
just to reconfirm that all
of the feelings that

51:37.828 --> 51:40.363
we've been having are
valid and real.

51:40.430 --> 51:41.631
So, I thought
we would start-

51:41.698 --> 51:46.103
Oh, my God, look.
Hi!

51:46.169 --> 51:47.437
Well, I guess
they're included because

51:47.504 --> 51:50.440
we've seen them grow up
before our eyes here.

51:50.507 --> 51:53.176
But I wanted to start on
the dock, obviously,

51:53.243 --> 51:55.378
because we've shared lots of
moments out here.

51:55.445 --> 51:58.515
Obviously, the very first
sunset you watched completely.

51:58.582 --> 52:02.786
And I just feel like we had
such a good connection out here.

52:02.853 --> 52:06.089
We have lots more to explore.
Lots more.

52:06.156 --> 52:08.325
Second spot.

52:08.391 --> 52:10.494
- Obviously...
-

52:10.560 --> 52:16.099
Is our amphitheatre where we
had our first kiss here.

52:16.166 --> 52:18.401
So...

52:18.468 --> 52:20.704
I thought this was an
extra special spot.

52:20.770 --> 52:24.107
So, obviously, I couldn't forget
the seated fire pit area.

52:24.174 --> 52:26.743
We were sitting right there
facing each other.

52:26.810 --> 52:29.179
Talking about our childhood.

52:29.246 --> 52:30.280
This actually kind of
reminds me of

52:30.347 --> 52:31.181
where I grew up in Maryland.

52:31.248 --> 52:33.283
I grew up in, like,
a very small town.

52:33.350 --> 52:34.718
Oh, yeah?

52:34.784 --> 52:36.386
Next...

52:36.453 --> 52:39.823
we're gonna head to
the small dock.

52:39.890 --> 52:41.391
I feel great about Paradise.

52:41.458 --> 52:44.394
Having met Angela, seeing
how we've grown together.

52:44.461 --> 52:47.230
It's, it's great.

52:47.297 --> 52:50.867
I think one of my most
memorable moments here would be

52:50.934 --> 52:53.737
the night that you stole me
away after the bonfire.

52:53.803 --> 52:57.641
And, we came here and laid and
just watched the stars.

53:01.378 --> 53:03.413
Like, I don't see one
spot here that

53:03.480 --> 53:05.248
doesn't have a
memory of you and I.

53:05.315 --> 53:06.249
- I know.
- You know what I mean?

53:06.316 --> 53:07.517
We made a lot of
memories here.

53:07.584 --> 53:08.518
- We're not done.
- We're not done?

53:08.585 --> 53:09.719
- Nm-nm.
- Okay.

53:09.786 --> 53:11.855
My connection with Brendan M.
at this point is amazing.

53:11.922 --> 53:13.323
It's the best
it's ever been.

53:13.390 --> 53:14.891
Every single moment I
spend with that man,

53:14.958 --> 53:17.460
I'm just like, happy.

53:17.527 --> 53:19.262
So, our final stop...

53:19.329 --> 53:21.598
These two bar stools.

53:21.665 --> 53:23.767
- Of course.
- At the end of the bar.

53:23.833 --> 53:25.535
Very first day of Paradise.

53:25.602 --> 53:27.804
I was the first person that you
sat down and talked to.

53:27.871 --> 53:30.407
And I'm pretty sure I smiled my
face off that conversation.

53:30.473 --> 53:31.575
I did too.

53:31.641 --> 53:33.510
- Wow!
- Yeah, you look good.

53:33.577 --> 53:35.178
- Points for Brendan.
- There we go.

53:37.414 --> 53:39.282
- You're so sweet.
- Cheers.

53:39.349 --> 53:40.417
Cheers.

53:40.483 --> 53:43.253
Angela makes me
feel warm inside.

53:43.320 --> 53:44.654
She makes me smile.

53:44.721 --> 53:47.324
She's just a breath
of fresh air.

53:47.390 --> 53:51.161
I have a little something
special here for you.

53:51.228 --> 53:52.495
- From me.
- Oh, this is...

53:52.562 --> 53:54.431
Aw.

53:54.497 --> 53:57.267
"Brendan, from the
moment we locked eyes,

53:57.334 --> 53:59.569
I knew there would be a
spark between us.

53:59.636 --> 54:01.905
Meeting you that first day of
Paradise filled me with

54:01.972 --> 54:04.407
excitement for this journey
and the possibilities

54:04.474 --> 54:05.609
of what may come.

54:05.675 --> 54:08.612
There has definitely been some
speed bumps along the way,

54:08.678 --> 54:10.647
but we keep on fighting,
and we always somehow

54:10.714 --> 54:12.415
make our way back
to each other.

54:12.482 --> 54:15.752
No matter what happens, I feel
so lucky to have met you.

54:15.819 --> 54:17.320
And I hope you know
I'm looking forward to

54:17.387 --> 54:20.824
more memories in
the future. Ange."

54:20.890 --> 54:23.426
You couldn't have summed it
up better in this letter.

54:23.493 --> 54:25.395
- I mean every word.
- I know you do.

54:25.462 --> 54:27.230
I would have never
guessed that

54:27.297 --> 54:28.832
I would find someone
like Angela.

54:28.898 --> 54:32.335
Our relationship is constantly
building, constantly growing.

54:32.402 --> 54:34.504
And because of that,
it's just, it's so simple.

54:34.571 --> 54:36.239
Every day I spend
time with you,

54:36.306 --> 54:39.275
you just like blow my
mind even more.

54:39.342 --> 54:41.711
There are these moments
sometimes and he'll just

54:41.778 --> 54:45.448
like be staring at me and,
with this look in his eye

54:45.515 --> 54:49.286
like he wants to say something
and stopped himself.

54:49.352 --> 54:50.787
I don't ever want
him to feel like

54:50.854 --> 54:53.490
there's anything that
he can't tell me.

54:58.561 --> 55:01.398
I genuinely feel as though I'm
falling in love with you.

55:01.464 --> 55:03.900
- Really?
- I really feel that.

55:03.967 --> 55:06.469
I'm falling in love with
you too, for real.

55:06.536 --> 55:07.937
Have been for a minute.

55:14.377 --> 55:16.413
- I'm so happy.
- Me too.

55:16.479 --> 55:18.882
At the bar, it was like a
full circle moment.

55:18.948 --> 55:20.850
́Cause that's where we met
and that's also where

55:20.917 --> 55:22.752
he told me he's falling
in love with me.

55:22.819 --> 55:24.821
I was figuring that was
what he was gonna say.

55:24.888 --> 55:25.855
- Mhm.
- My heart is full.

55:25.922 --> 55:26.856
- Is it?
- Yeah.

55:26.923 --> 55:28.525
Same, mine is too.

55:28.591 --> 55:31.494
I could see myself, at the end
of this, giving her a ring.

55:31.561 --> 55:33.329
This is a big decision.

55:33.396 --> 55:35.432
It can't be taken lightly so,

55:35.498 --> 55:37.634
I have to do a lot of
thinking about this one.

55:43.373 --> 55:44.874
<i>Coming up...</i>

55:44.941 --> 55:46.876
Please, like, I feel like
I'm in the hot seat.

55:46.943 --> 55:48.678
It's getting out of hand
right now.

55:48.745 --> 55:51.314
Now I feel like he's
gaslighting me again.

55:51.381 --> 55:54.017
Quite frankly, I don't know
if I want to leave and

55:54.084 --> 55:56.720
work on anything if we
can't resolve it here.

55:56.786 --> 55:59.389
I feel this is a prank
or something.

55:59.456 --> 56:01.391
Like I feel like I'm about
to explode.

56:01.458 --> 56:02.792
Kamil!

56:14.137 --> 56:16.139
- I'm so happy.
- Me too.

56:16.206 --> 56:17.707
I feel so happy.

56:17.774 --> 56:20.543
Brendan M. is falling
in love with me.

56:20.610 --> 56:22.679
I was figuring that was
what he was gonna say.

56:22.746 --> 56:24.914
I feel the same.

56:24.981 --> 56:27.684
And I feel really lucky that
we found each other,

56:27.751 --> 56:31.421
and that Paradise is
working this time for me.

56:31.488 --> 56:32.455
- Mm.
- Mm.

56:32.522 --> 56:33.990
- Mm...
- Mm.

56:34.057 --> 56:35.024
I don't know what
that is actually.

56:35.091 --> 56:36.659
- What is this?
- I'm not sure.

56:36.726 --> 56:38.762
- No, should we look at it?
- I guess.

56:38.828 --> 56:40.930
Alright, it says, "Angela
and Brendan M."

56:40.997 --> 56:43.700
I didn't write this one.
Oh, it's from Jesse.

56:43.767 --> 56:46.970
"Angela and Brendan M.,
the fantasy suite awaits.

56:47.036 --> 56:50.673
The choice is yours.
Jesse." Okay.

56:50.740 --> 56:53.009
- Mhm, I'm down for that.
- I am also down for that.

56:53.076 --> 56:54.477
I would love to spend
more time with you.

56:54.544 --> 56:55.979
I would love to spend
more time with you.

56:56.045 --> 56:57.147
Okay, good.

56:57.213 --> 56:59.482
Ding.

57:06.089 --> 57:08.158
I'm so excited for
fantasy suites tonight.

57:08.224 --> 57:10.794
We just get to hang out
and snuggle,

57:10.860 --> 57:13.930
and wake up beside each other
and have a little glimpse of

57:13.997 --> 57:17.133
what life in the real world
would be like.

57:17.200 --> 57:18.868
This is very nice.

57:21.938 --> 57:23.072
We're going to the
fantasy suite.

57:23.139 --> 57:24.274
I'm very excited.

57:24.340 --> 57:27.010
It gives Angela and I the
opportunity to connect and just

57:27.076 --> 57:30.013
talk about things on a
deeper level without...

57:30.079 --> 57:31.514
you know, any pressure.

57:31.581 --> 57:33.750
I can't wait to spend
a night with Angela.

57:44.994 --> 57:46.596
- Oh, this is fancy.
- This is exciting.

57:46.663 --> 57:49.666
- Ooh, chocolate!
- Yeah, have a seat.

57:49.732 --> 57:51.734
I guess we got champagne.

57:51.801 --> 57:54.671
Kamil knows I care about him.
But, there's still some

57:54.737 --> 57:57.907
things that I need to clarify
this evening in order to

57:57.974 --> 58:01.544
be able to move forward into
life outside of Paradise.

58:01.611 --> 58:03.813
- It's like another date.
- I know, our second one.

58:03.880 --> 58:05.715
I know, right.

58:05.782 --> 58:07.617
Coming into Paradise and,

58:07.684 --> 58:10.753
finding a woman like Caitlin
has been amazing.

58:10.820 --> 58:13.890
And I'm thinking about having
a nice, intimate moment.

58:13.957 --> 58:16.860
Pop some bubbly.
Fantasy suite sounds amazing.

58:16.926 --> 58:19.195
I didn't really pack much,
I just brought a toothbrush.

58:19.262 --> 58:20.864
How are you feeling?
Are you excited?

58:20.930 --> 58:22.599
Yeah, for sure.
Are you?

58:22.665 --> 58:25.735
Mhm...
That's it?

58:25.802 --> 58:27.537
No, no, I am really excited.

58:27.604 --> 58:28.938
Just dive in and
have a good time.

58:29.005 --> 58:31.241
- Just relax, kick back.
- Yeah.

58:31.307 --> 58:32.976
I'm hoping that he feels
more comfortable and

58:33.042 --> 58:36.012
can open up a little bit more
emotionally and shows me

58:36.079 --> 58:39.816
that he wants to make things
work outside of here.

58:39.883 --> 58:42.619
Do you have any, I don't
know, kind of like concerns

58:42.685 --> 58:45.922
or like questions about,
you know, my everyday life?

58:45.989 --> 58:48.658
No, not really.

58:48.725 --> 58:50.827
I mean, what are you
concerned about?

58:50.894 --> 58:54.230
I mean, I, you know, distance
is obviously like a huge factor.

58:54.297 --> 58:56.833
But, I mean, I think as
long as, you know,

58:56.900 --> 58:58.301
there's trust and honesty-

58:58.368 --> 59:01.204
I don't even know what
his day-to-day life is.

59:01.271 --> 59:03.339
Are you a good texter?
Are you a good caller?

59:03.406 --> 59:04.707
Like...

59:04.774 --> 59:06.109
Am I good a texter?
Am I a good caller?

59:06.175 --> 59:08.311
This is real shit.

59:08.378 --> 59:09.979
- I'm on silent.
- Oh.

59:10.046 --> 59:11.147
Yeah.

59:11.214 --> 59:13.816
But I always check my phone
every single minute so...

59:13.883 --> 59:17.287
I'm always there, but I just
don't like alerts.

59:17.353 --> 59:20.023
How are you gonna handle
life without Brendan?

59:20.089 --> 59:22.191
Oh, yeah, that will be hard.

59:22.258 --> 59:25.662
I feel like we have a plan
after life in Paradise.

59:25.728 --> 59:27.263
We're definitely gonna
FaceTime every day.

59:27.330 --> 59:29.065
I mean,
that doesn't feel great.

59:29.132 --> 59:31.367
Why? That's why tonight
is the perfect day to

59:31.434 --> 59:32.902
figure out what
we're gonna have.

59:32.969 --> 59:34.971
Are you freaking
serious right now?

59:35.038 --> 59:38.675
There have been instances
where I felt like

59:38.741 --> 59:40.343
his relationship
with Brendan S.

59:40.410 --> 59:42.679
was more important than ours.

59:42.745 --> 59:44.781
Is that something you'd
want to do with us?

59:44.847 --> 59:45.949
Yeah, of course.

59:46.015 --> 59:48.117
Yeah, like, why are
you like so...

59:48.184 --> 59:50.954
doubtful that that won't happen?

59:51.020 --> 59:52.689
- Kamil...
- Mhm.

59:52.755 --> 59:55.058
You're spinning this
back on me.

59:55.124 --> 59:56.392
I was just asking
you a question.

59:56.459 --> 59:58.928
I'm not, I'm not.
I'm just, not big deal.

1:00:01.431 --> 1:00:04.968
And if we're doing that
here in Paradise,

1:00:05.034 --> 1:00:07.904
then how is that gonna
translate into the real world?

1:00:07.971 --> 1:00:10.640
We don't even have a plan to
see each other after this.

1:00:10.707 --> 1:00:13.109
We just said this today for
shits and giggles.

1:00:13.176 --> 1:00:15.211
My brain is just trying
to process like,

1:00:15.278 --> 1:00:16.779
what the hell is going on?

1:00:16.846 --> 1:00:19.716
Why is she doing this?
Why is she doubting me?

1:00:19.782 --> 1:00:21.651
Why is she doubting
our relationship?

1:00:21.718 --> 1:00:23.419
Like I feel like this is
like an interview

1:00:23.486 --> 1:00:24.954
before me leaving Paradise.

1:00:25.021 --> 1:00:27.223
Like it feels like
nonsense to me.

1:00:27.290 --> 1:00:29.993
It's stressful!
It should be scary for you too.

1:00:30.059 --> 1:00:33.196
It's not scary for me.

1:00:33.262 --> 1:00:36.666
We're no longer, you know,
just thinking about Paradise.

1:00:36.733 --> 1:00:39.369
I'm thinking about how this
translates into the real world,

1:00:39.435 --> 1:00:42.138
and I have to make sure that
this is right for me.

1:00:42.205 --> 1:00:44.040
It's real life,
like I don't-

1:00:44.107 --> 1:00:45.274
Caitlin, I-

1:00:45.341 --> 1:00:47.410
I don't even know what
you want in a partner.

1:00:47.477 --> 1:00:50.046
Like we haven't even had
that conversation.

1:00:50.113 --> 1:00:53.282
And I don't know what boxes
I even check for you.

1:00:53.349 --> 1:00:55.718
I just want to leave
Paradise with you and

1:00:55.785 --> 1:00:57.220
that's all I want to do.

1:00:57.286 --> 1:01:00.223
Caitlin is bombarding me with
question, after question,

1:01:00.289 --> 1:01:02.959
after question, and it's
freaking me out.

1:01:03.026 --> 1:01:06.963
I came here to get my love story
and, you know what,

1:01:07.030 --> 1:01:09.699
I just realized, you know,
how much emphasis tonight

1:01:09.766 --> 1:01:12.468
really has on our relationship
outside of here.

1:01:12.535 --> 1:01:16.806
And I need to stick to what I
know I need in a relationship.

1:01:16.873 --> 1:01:19.242
And if I don't get that
this evening then

1:01:19.308 --> 1:01:21.010
I just have to walk away.

1:01:30.486 --> 1:01:32.422
I just want to leave
Paradise with you and

1:01:32.488 --> 1:01:33.990
that's all I want to do.

1:01:34.057 --> 1:01:36.526
So, but this is my biggest
worry, honestly.

1:01:36.592 --> 1:01:37.627
Alright.

1:01:37.693 --> 1:01:40.029
Because there is gonna be so
many challenges for us

1:01:40.096 --> 1:01:41.264
outside of here.

1:01:41.330 --> 1:01:42.498
I know that.

1:01:42.565 --> 1:01:46.035
I need someone who is going to
be okay with me disagreeing

1:01:46.102 --> 1:01:49.238
with them or okay
with me not liking

1:01:49.305 --> 1:01:51.074
what they say occasionally.

1:01:51.140 --> 1:01:52.375
And we have talk
to through them.

1:01:52.442 --> 1:01:56.479
Caitlin, relax, please, like-
I'm, I'm getting to the point,

1:01:56.546 --> 1:01:59.949
I feel like it's, it's getting
out of hand right now.

1:02:00.016 --> 1:02:02.185
I don't know what to do.
What am I doing wrong?

1:02:02.251 --> 1:02:04.153
How did I get here?

1:02:04.220 --> 1:02:05.455
Do you want to see me
outside of here?

1:02:05.521 --> 1:02:08.524
I just told you I do, like,
Caitlin, like-

1:02:08.591 --> 1:02:10.426
really, like,
right now, like...

1:02:10.493 --> 1:02:12.028
I feel like I'm in the
hot seat, like...

1:02:12.095 --> 1:02:14.497
Kamil, why are you
getting stressed out?

1:02:14.564 --> 1:02:16.733
Because it's like, it's...

1:02:16.799 --> 1:02:19.068
What, what, what is, like,
you have to use your words.

1:02:19.135 --> 1:02:20.236
I don't know how you're
feeling right now.

1:02:20.303 --> 1:02:22.038
I don't know, like the way
you're reacting to me, like,

1:02:22.105 --> 1:02:25.641
right now is like not the
person that I know and

1:02:25.708 --> 1:02:28.010
you always have like
a sweet smile and,

1:02:28.077 --> 1:02:30.179
and gentle like approach
to everything.

1:02:30.246 --> 1:02:32.381
And today you're like-

1:02:32.448 --> 1:02:34.016
"Tomorrow's the day,
we're leaving."

1:02:34.083 --> 1:02:35.218
- Tomorrow's like-
- ́Cause it is!

1:02:35.284 --> 1:02:38.187
I know, but why are you making
such a big deal about it?

1:02:38.254 --> 1:02:41.757
I have never seen this side
of Caitlin before and it's

1:02:41.824 --> 1:02:46.129
really tapping into my past
relationship in Paradise.

1:02:46.195 --> 1:02:48.598
This is like so surreal
at this moment.

1:02:48.664 --> 1:02:50.566
I just don't know
how to react.

1:02:50.633 --> 1:02:52.401
It's, it's very
overwhelming.

1:02:52.468 --> 1:02:54.270
Like, right now it feels to
me like you don't even

1:02:54.337 --> 1:02:56.172
want to take this
outside of here.

1:02:56.239 --> 1:02:59.275
Quite frankly, I don't know
if I want to leave and

1:02:59.342 --> 1:03:01.377
work on anything if we
can't resolve it here.

1:03:01.444 --> 1:03:02.512
And that's what I'm
seeing from you.

1:03:02.578 --> 1:03:04.480
Kamil, we're not going to
agree on a lot of things.

1:03:04.547 --> 1:03:07.216
Caitlin, I don't know, like,
I'd love to revisit this

1:03:07.283 --> 1:03:09.485
conversation, maybe tomorrow
morning or something.

1:03:09.552 --> 1:03:11.587
Because tonight, it's like...

1:03:11.654 --> 1:03:14.023
the way you're pushing
and just pushing,

1:03:14.090 --> 1:03:15.525
and pushing, and
pushing, it's like...

1:03:15.591 --> 1:03:16.592
Kamil...

1:03:16.659 --> 1:03:20.797
No, it's just, Caitlin,
like, I met you, day one.

1:03:20.863 --> 1:03:23.332
And right now you're being a
totally different person.

1:03:23.399 --> 1:03:26.536
I feel like this is a
prank or something.

1:03:26.602 --> 1:03:29.372
I can't believe this is
freaking happening right now.

1:03:29.438 --> 1:03:30.573
Kamil...

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:34.811
I'm having flashbacks to like
my bad time in Paradise...

1:03:34.877 --> 1:03:37.213
when I was sitting in
the hot seat and

1:03:37.280 --> 1:03:38.447
the whole world hated me.

1:03:38.514 --> 1:03:40.783
It was like a nightmare that
was unfolding in front of me,

1:03:40.850 --> 1:03:43.486
and I can't believe it's
happening for the second time.

1:03:43.553 --> 1:03:45.488
Like I feel like I'm about
to explode.

1:03:50.893 --> 1:03:53.563
<i>Next time, on the dramatic
season finale of</i>

1:03:53.629 --> 1:03:55.131
<i>Bachelor in Paradise Canada.</i>

1:03:55.198 --> 1:03:56.332
Last day.

1:03:56.399 --> 1:03:58.568
I do feel like there's something
that he's not telling me.

1:03:58.634 --> 1:04:00.603
Now is at the point where
we make a decision.

1:04:00.670 --> 1:04:04.073
You're gonna see if you can take
on the real world together.

1:04:07.543 --> 1:04:09.579
It's just a conversation
that turned into

1:04:09.645 --> 1:04:11.247
an epic battle.

1:04:11.314 --> 1:04:13.816
My heart is saying one thing
and my brain is saying

1:04:13.883 --> 1:04:15.484
something totally different.

1:04:15.551 --> 1:04:17.653
I just need a man who can
use his brain and

1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:18.921
answer the question.

1:04:18.988 --> 1:04:23.259
Shit's hitting the fan and now
the fan's breaking off.

1:04:23.326 --> 1:04:26.262
I'm so ready for my
happy ending, finally.

1:04:26.329 --> 1:04:30.266
I could see myself, at the end
of this, giving her a ring.

1:04:30.333 --> 1:04:31.601
Angela...

1:04:35.738 --> 1:04:38.574
<i>And campers go head-to-head
on After the Final Rose.</i>

1:04:38.641 --> 1:04:40.142
I also take blame
for some of that.

1:04:40.209 --> 1:04:42.545
Give him his airtime so he can
say his piece right now.

1:04:42.612 --> 1:04:43.746
You came in hot.

1:04:43.813 --> 1:04:45.514
It's kind of backhanded.
It makes no sense.

1:04:45.581 --> 1:04:46.682
And how'd that
work out for you?

1:04:46.749 --> 1:04:51.120
I'm a strong woman
and, I kind of lost myself.

1:04:51.187 --> 1:04:52.855
How was your best
friend's wedding?

1:04:52.922 --> 1:04:55.157
Vay...

1:04:55.224 --> 1:04:57.760
I catch you at a bar in the
arms of another guy.

1:04:57.827 --> 1:04:59.362
You think it's a good idea
to be sitting there

1:04:59.428 --> 1:05:01.330
with your friends talking
shit about me?

1:05:01.397 --> 1:05:03.499
I have a screen shot of the
text message

1:05:03.566 --> 1:05:04.467
you sent you, Vay.

1:05:04.533 --> 1:05:06.369
- I'm done.
- You use that as an excuse now.

1:05:06.435 --> 1:05:07.637
I'm done! Honestly!

1:05:07.703 --> 1:05:08.771
Oh, my God.

1:05:08.838 --> 1:05:12.141
Give us an update.
What's the latest?

1:05:12.208 --> 1:05:13.276
Yeah, so, ah...

1:05:13.342 --> 1:05:14.377
Ange is...
