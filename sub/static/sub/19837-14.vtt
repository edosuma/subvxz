00:20.040 --> 00:23.150
<b>The word "unknown" holds magic.</b>

<b>And some incredible people are

00:27.490 --> 00:29.290
<b>They are known...</b>

00:33.060 --> 00:35.010
<b>...as Hunters!</b>

01:57.780 --> 02:00.440
<b>We entered the long and difficult path.</b>

02:00.440 --> 02:02.370
<b>Then cut a hole in the wall,</b>

02:02.370 --> 02:05.060
<b>to sneak into the short and easy path.</b>

02:06.130 --> 02:08.190
<b><i>In an extreme situation,</i></b>

02:08.190 --> 02:10.090

02:54.980 --> 02:59.360
<b>Ladies and gentlemen, congratulations

02:59.810 --> 03:04.240
<b>Only the Fourth Phase and 
the Final Phase remain.</b>

03:04.240 --> 03:05.870
<b>Two more...</b>

03:06.540 --> 03:10.570
<b>The Fourth Phase will take place 
over there, on Zevil Island.</b>

03:10.570 --> 03:12.250
<b>Let us proceed.</b>

03:18.620 --> 03:21.910
<b>I will need you to draw lots.</b>

03:22.800 --> 03:23.930
<b>Lots?</b>

03:23.930 --> 03:26.310
<b>For what?</b>

03:28.520 --> 03:31.060
<b>To determine who will hunt 
and who will be hunted.</b>

03:31.820 --> 03:35.560
<b>In here are twenty-four numbered cards.</b>

03:35.990 --> 03:41.200
<b>In other words, your ID numbers 
are on the cards.</b>

03:41.810 --> 03:44.420
<b>Now, I need you each to draw a card,</b>

03:44.420 --> 03:46.700
<b>in the order by which you 
exited the tower.</b>

03:46.700 --> 03:49.200
<b>Will the first person come forward?</b>

04:17.230 --> 04:19.230
<b>Guess I'm next.</b>

04:24.940 --> 04:26.530
<b>I'm next.</b>

04:34.690 --> 04:35.910
<b>Hey, Killua.</b>

04:35.910 --> 04:36.500
<b>Huh?</b>

04:36.500 --> 04:39.250
<b>He said something about hunting 
and being hunted.</b>

04:39.250 --> 04:42.230
<b>Does that mean we'll be 
fighting each other?</b>

04:42.230 --> 04:43.510
<b>Yeah, probably.</b>

05:13.330 --> 05:15.400
<b>I don't know what this is all about,</b>

05:15.400 --> 05:17.800
<b>but I draw with style...</b>

05:31.050 --> 05:32.430
<b>Everyone's taken a card?</b>

05:33.350 --> 05:37.940
<b>Then, remove the seal from your card.</b>

05:48.860 --> 05:51.160
<b>The card indicates your target.</b>

06:04.210 --> 06:07.940
<b>This box has recorded which card</b>

06:07.940 --> 06:11.350
<b>each of you drew.</b>

06:11.800 --> 06:14.280
<b>This means that you're free</b>

06:14.280 --> 06:17.480
<b>to dispose of the cards if you wish.</b>

06:18.000 --> 06:19.020
<b>The objective</b>

06:19.020 --> 06:21.980
<b>is to steal your target's ID tag.</b>

06:21.980 --> 06:25.480
<b>Oh, so we don't need to kill each other.</b>

06:25.480 --> 06:28.280
<b>Naturally, you're free to use 
any method you choose</b>

06:28.280 --> 06:30.080
<b>to steal the ID tags.</b>

06:30.720 --> 06:35.240
<b>Including killing your target and 
taking the tag off the corpse.</b>

06:35.650 --> 06:38.570
<b>That sounds like the fastest way.</b>

06:38.570 --> 06:40.780
<b>S-So that's what this is about?</b>

06:40.780 --> 06:43.000
<b>Fool, there's nothing to be scared of.</b>

06:43.000 --> 06:44.500
<b>Listen carefully!</b>

06:45.750 --> 06:51.010
<b>Your target's ID tag is worth three points.</b>

06:51.690 --> 06:54.760
<b>Your own ID is also worth three points.</b>

06:55.270 --> 06:58.520
<b>All other ID tags are worth one point.</b>

06:58.520 --> 07:03.650
<b>You need six points to advance 
to the Final Phase.</b>

07:03.650 --> 07:06.580
<b>So while on Zevil Island,</b>

07:06.580 --> 07:10.680
<b>you must gather enough ID tags 
to total six points.</b>

07:12.090 --> 07:16.480
<b>That is the condition for clearing 
the Hunter Exam's Fourth Phase.</b>

07:21.260 --> 07:22.890
<b>I'd like to commend everyone on board</b>

07:22.890 --> 07:26.050
<b>for their excellent work during the 
Hunter Exam's Third Phase!</b>

07:26.050 --> 07:29.340
<b>I will serve as your guide.</b>

07:29.340 --> 07:31.300
<b>My name is Khara!</b>

07:31.300 --> 07:36.810
<b>It will take two hours for 
this boat to reach Zevil Island.</b>

07:36.810 --> 07:39.880
<b>All twenty-four applicants remaining here</b>

07:39.880 --> 07:45.190
<b>are automatically qualified

07:45.740 --> 07:48.690
<b>So if you fail this year, don't feel bad.</b>

07:48.690 --> 07:53.700
<b>Please try again next year...</b>

07:55.220 --> 07:58.200
<b><i>Th-This is so depressing.</i></b>

08:00.160 --> 08:03.080
<b>The battle has already begun.</b>

08:03.080 --> 08:06.880
<b>Yeah, everyone's removed their ID tags,</b>

08:06.880 --> 08:09.840
<b>and hid them.</b>

08:09.840 --> 08:12.830
<b>Well, you're free to do as you like,</b>

08:12.830 --> 08:15.200
<b>for the next two hours.</b>

08:15.200 --> 08:19.180
<b>Please enjoy the boat ride.</b>

08:26.650 --> 08:29.380
<b>Speaking hypothetically...</b>

08:29.960 --> 08:32.640
<b>If you happened to be my target,</b>

08:32.640 --> 08:35.450
<b>I wouldn't show any mercy.</b>

08:35.450 --> 08:37.250
<b>Naturally.</b>

08:37.250 --> 08:39.720
<b>If you happened to be my target,</b>

08:39.720 --> 08:41.450
<b>
I would say the same.</b>

08:41.870 --> 08:43.960
<b>Am I your target?</b>

08:45.420 --> 08:47.460
<b>I was speaking hypothetically.</b>

08:47.460 --> 08:50.750
<b>Oh, right...</b>

08:51.510 --> 08:53.060
<b>Don't worry.</b>

08:53.060 --> 08:55.330
<b>You are not my target.</b>

08:55.330 --> 08:56.720
<b>I-I see...</b>

08:57.430 --> 09:00.220
<b>And you aren't my target!</b>

09:06.280 --> 09:07.050
<b>Yo.</b>

09:17.810 --> 09:20.910
<b>What number did you draw?</b>

09:21.260 --> 09:22.680
<b>How about you?</b>

09:22.680 --> 09:23.820
<b>Secret.</b>

09:31.270 --> 09:32.760
<b>Don't worry.</b>

09:32.760 --> 09:35.300
<b>You aren't my target.</b>

09:35.850 --> 09:37.800
<b>And my target isn't you.</b>

09:40.500 --> 09:43.090
<b>Show each other our numbers 
at the same time?</b>

09:43.090 --> 09:44.310
<b>Okay!</b>

09:45.070 --> 09:46.310
<b>Ready, and...</b>

09:49.060 --> 09:51.160
<b>#44 is...</b>

09:54.590 --> 09:55.820
<b>Seriously?</b>

09:58.220 --> 10:00.510
<b>You have really bad luck...</b>

10:01.100 --> 10:02.430
<b>You think so?</b>

10:03.770 --> 10:06.880
<b>Who's #199?</b>

10:06.880 --> 10:09.030
<b>You don't know, either?</b>

10:09.030 --> 10:09.880
<b>Uh-uh.</b>

10:10.310 --> 10:14.250
<b>I didn't bother to memorize 
everyone's numbers.</b>

10:14.250 --> 10:15.920
<b>After the initial explanation,</b>

10:15.920 --> 10:18.070
<b>I started checking tags,</b>

10:18.070 --> 10:20.790
<b>but everyone had already removed them.</b>

10:20.790 --> 10:22.270
<b>That's so lame...</b>

10:27.810 --> 10:28.580
<b>Gon...</b>

10:29.240 --> 10:29.920
<b>Huh?</b>

10:29.920 --> 10:30.970
<b>What?</b>

10:31.940 --> 10:33.920
<b>Are you happy?</b>

10:33.920 --> 10:35.530
<b>Or scared?</b>

10:40.170 --> 10:42.400
<b>Both, I guess...</b>

10:44.380 --> 10:47.130
<b>In a straight-up fight,</b>

10:47.130 --> 10:49.550
<b>I wouldn't stand a chance.</b>

10:50.200 --> 10:53.000
<b>But if I only need to steal his ID tag,</b>

10:53.000 --> 10:56.650
<b>then I have a real shot.</b>

10:56.650 --> 10:57.800
<b>Yeah.</b>

10:58.700 --> 11:00.090
<b>Right now,</b>

11:00.090 --> 11:02.220
<b>I might actually have a chance.</b>

11:03.030 --> 11:06.310
<b>That scares me a little...</b>

11:06.790 --> 11:08.380
<b>But I think it's worth it.</b>

11:10.110 --> 11:11.810
<b>I see.</b>

11:13.560 --> 11:15.340
<b>Well, let's do our best.</b>

11:19.110 --> 11:21.570
<b>Make sure you stay alive, Gon.</b>

11:21.860 --> 11:22.480
<b>Uh-huh!</b>

11:22.480 --> 11:23.860
<b>You, too.</b>

11:31.730 --> 11:33.740
<b>Thanks for your patience, everyone.</b>

11:33.740 --> 11:36.210
<b>We've finally arrived at Zevil Island!</b>

11:36.210 --> 11:40.210
<b>Now, please disembark in the order by which</b>

11:40.210 --> 11:42.840
<b>you cleared the Third Phase.</b>

11:42.840 --> 11:43.930
<b>Tsk...</b>

11:43.930 --> 11:45.100
<b>This again.</b>

11:45.100 --> 11:47.300
<b>After each person disembarks,</b>

11:47.300 --> 11:50.890
<b>we'll wait two minutes before 
the next person's turn.</b>

11:51.450 --> 11:54.290
<b>That means we'll be waiting 
here a while.</b>

11:54.290 --> 11:55.380
<b>Yeah.</b>

11:55.380 --> 11:58.110
<b>You will stay on this island 
for exactly one week.</b>

11:58.110 --> 11:59.270
<b>During that time,</b>

11:59.270 --> 12:03.990
<b>you must amass your six points 
of ID tags and return here.</b>

12:03.990 --> 12:07.740
<b>All right then, the first person may start!</b>

12:16.750 --> 12:18.470
<b>I understand...</b>

12:18.470 --> 12:20.850
<b>Those who disembark earlier 
hold the advantage.</b>

12:20.850 --> 12:21.630
<b>Yeah.</b>

12:22.100 --> 12:24.300
<b>They can hide and monitor</b>

12:24.300 --> 12:27.390
<b>their target's movements.</b>

12:28.020 --> 12:29.560
<b>Two minutes have passed.</b>

12:29.560 --> 12:31.580
<b>The second person may start!</b>

12:37.850 --> 12:39.900
<b>The third person may start.</b>

12:39.900 --> 12:41.650
<b>Yeah!</b>

12:42.290 --> 12:43.650
<b>The seventh person...</b>

12:44.180 --> 12:45.740
<b>The eleventh person...</b>

12:46.540 --> 12:48.050
<b>The fifteenth person...</b>

12:49.330 --> 12:51.910
<b>The twentieth person may start.</b>

12:56.050 --> 12:57.480
<b>Two minutes have passed.</b>

12:57.480 --> 12:59.670
<b>The twenty-first person may start!</b>

13:00.670 --> 13:01.720
<b>See ya.</b>

13:01.720 --> 13:02.590
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

13:08.300 --> 13:09.550
<b>Well,</b>

13:09.550 --> 13:12.320
<b>guess I'll begin by scouting the island.</b>

13:14.540 --> 13:15.860
<b>Two minutes have passed.</b>

13:15.860 --> 13:17.940
<b>The twenty-second person may start.</b>

13:17.940 --> 13:19.020
<b>Okay!</b>

13:19.320 --> 13:20.300
<b>See you...</b>

13:20.300 --> 13:21.130
<b>Yeah!</b>

13:26.900 --> 13:29.070
<b><i>First, I need to find Hisoka!</i></b>

13:29.090 --> 13:39.170
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

13:35.120 --> 13:39.170
<b>Zevil Island</b>

13:46.860 --> 13:50.010
<b><i>How do I steal Hisoka's ID tag?</i></b>

13:53.680 --> 13:55.180
<b><i>Such a good boy.</i></b>

13:59.110 --> 14:00.360
<b><i>Very nice.</i></b>

14:01.350 --> 14:03.570
<b><i>I'm getting excited now...</i></b>

14:17.860 --> 14:22.360
<b><i>I won't be able to steal his tag 
with a head-on attack...</i></b>

14:30.280 --> 14:31.740
<b><i>It's another applicant.</i></b>

14:35.360 --> 14:37.430
<b><i>And another one is behind him.</i></b>

14:41.430 --> 14:43.690
<b><i>He's targeting the guy in front.</i></b>

15:15.850 --> 15:17.020
<b><i>He blew it!</i></b>

15:19.070 --> 15:21.770
<b>Hey, that was close.</b>

15:24.770 --> 15:28.310
<b>Sorry, but it won't be that easy...</b>

15:28.310 --> 15:30.530
<b>That easy...</b>

15:30.530 --> 15:31.990
<b>Wh-What?</b>

15:34.900 --> 15:36.700
<b>B-Bastard...</b>

15:37.800 --> 15:41.320
<b>The arrow was coated with 
a fast acting tranquilizer.</b>

15:41.320 --> 15:44.080
<b>You won't be able to walk 
for the next week.</b>

15:45.410 --> 15:46.740
<b>Don't worry.</b>

15:46.740 --> 15:48.420
<b>There's water nearby.</b>

15:48.420 --> 15:49.920
<b>You won't die.</b>

15:51.160 --> 15:53.190
<b>I'll be taking this.</b>

15:53.500 --> 15:54.800
<b>See ya.</b>

15:58.160 --> 15:59.380
<b><i>Wow.</i></b>

15:59.980 --> 16:02.120
<b><i>He was able to mask his own presence</i></b>

16:02.120 --> 16:04.190
<b><i>as he stalked his prey.</i></b>

16:05.440 --> 16:09.900
<b><i>And his target was able to

16:09.900 --> 16:11.150
<b><i>and quickly dodge it,</i></b>

16:11.150 --> 16:12.980

<b><i>However,</i></b>

16:14.160 --> 16:16.290
<b><i>the other applicant anticipated this,</i></b>

16:16.290 --> 16:18.200
<b><i>and poisoned his arrow...</i></b>

16:20.760 --> 16:22.490
<b><i>This is how you hunt!</i></b>

16:29.070 --> 16:33.300
<b><i>If I have any chance at

16:33.300 --> 16:34.590
<b><i>this is it!</i></b>

16:42.740 --> 16:45.020
<b><i>First, I have to sneak up on him</i></b>

16:45.020 --> 16:46.230
<b><i>without being noticed.</i></b>

16:48.070 --> 16:49.730
<b><i>Then I wait for my chance,</i></b>

16:50.080 --> 16:51.070
<b><i>and steal his tag!</i></b>

16:53.730 --> 16:55.110
<b>Yeah!</b>

17:01.310 --> 17:05.080
<b><i>But unlike this target, 
Hisoka will be moving...</i></b>

17:08.490 --> 17:10.800
<b><i>Regardless, I'll only get one shot.</i></b>

17:10.800 --> 17:13.880
<b><i>I have to hook Hisoka's tag</i></b>

17:13.880 --> 17:16.640
<b><i>when he isn't paying attention.</i></b>

17:20.730 --> 17:21.830
<b>Okay...</b>

17:27.250 --> 17:29.390
<b><i>Read his movements...</i></b>

17:33.730 --> 17:34.490
<b>Now!</b>

17:48.510 --> 17:49.750
<b>Hmm...</b>

17:49.750 --> 17:51.800
<b>This isn't quite right...</b>

17:52.590 --> 17:55.510
<b>It's too easy to predict</b>

17:55.510 --> 17:58.800
<b>how a swinging target will move.</b>

18:08.150 --> 18:09.410
<b>That's right.</b>

18:09.830 --> 18:12.440
<b>I shouldn't forget that Hisoka will 
try to move out of the way.</b>

18:24.410 --> 18:26.540
<b><i>If I can't get a bird</i></b>

18:26.540 --> 18:28.250
<b><i>by watching how it moves,</i></b>

18:28.250 --> 18:31.030
<b><i>I'll never be able to steal Hisoka's ID!</i></b>

18:42.300 --> 18:43.240
<b>Huh?</b>

18:44.190 --> 18:45.300
<b>Oh, well!</b>

18:45.300 --> 18:47.980
<b>I won't catch a bird on the

18:49.870 --> 18:50.720
<b>There!</b>

19:01.530 --> 19:04.040
<b>Whose number is this?</b>

19:09.030 --> 19:11.500
<b>The sun's about to set...</b>

19:11.500 --> 19:14.720
<b>I should probably stay in one place 
until tomorrow morning.</b>

19:22.890 --> 19:23.860
<b>Damn...</b>

19:23.860 --> 19:26.810
<b>I didn't think it would be so hard.</b>

19:28.950 --> 19:31.380
<b>It's too dark for me to see anything.</b>

19:31.380 --> 19:33.810
<b>And all the birds are gone...</b>

19:34.270 --> 19:35.170
<b>Okay...</b>

19:35.170 --> 19:36.730
<b>I'll catch one tomorrow!</b>

19:50.340 --> 19:51.360
<b>Right!</b>

19:51.360 --> 19:53.080
<b>Back to training!</b>

20:05.970 --> 20:07.330
<b>It's no use.</b>

20:08.100 --> 20:10.520
<b>Maybe it's not possible, after all.</b>

20:11.360 --> 20:13.150
<b>To catch a bird,</b>

20:13.660 --> 20:16.620
<b>with accuracy, while it's in flight...</b>

20:24.970 --> 20:29.290
<b><i>Birds can catch fish that are swimming.</i></b>

20:43.180 --> 20:43.800
<b><i>Go!</i></b>

20:51.420 --> 20:52.690
<b><i>I get it...</i></b>

20:53.750 --> 20:54.940
<b><i>There's a moment</i></b>

20:56.050 --> 20:58.940
<b><i>when I know exactly what 
my target will do next!</i></b>

21:17.520 --> 21:18.090
<b><i>Now!</i></b>

21:22.660 --> 21:24.160
<b>I did it!</b>

21:24.650 --> 21:26.360
<b><i>I figured it out!</i></b>

21:26.360 --> 21:30.560
<b><i>I have to aim for my target as 
he hunts his own prey!</i></b>

21:33.600 --> 21:34.550
<b><i>Heh.</i></b>

21:34.990 --> 21:37.270
<b><i>He actually mastered 
the art of hunting.</i></b>

21:37.270 --> 21:38.560
<b><i>Impressive little boy...</i></b>

21:40.310 --> 21:44.140
<b><i>But that intense concentration 
will be your undoing.</i></b>

21:48.010 --> 21:52.690
<b>Gon finally mastered the trick that 
would help him hunt Hisoka.</b>

21:52.690 --> 21:57.610
<b>However, Gon was also being hunted.</b>

23:28.130 --> 23:30.380
<b>Next time: Explosion x Of x Deception!</b>

23:30.380 --> 23:31.010
<b>Explode!</b>

23:31.010 --> 23:31.700
<b>Explode...</b>

23:31.700 --> 23:32.800
<b>Ka-boom!</b>

23:32.800 --> 23:34.140
<b>Oh, mushroom.</b>
