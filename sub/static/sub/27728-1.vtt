Every small town has a story,

00:06.206 --> 00:09.776
but my hometown has a legend.

00:09.776 --> 00:14.414
Roswell was a sleepy cowboy
settlement in postwar America,

00:14.414 --> 00:17.251
full of farmers
and military men,

00:17.251 --> 00:21.588
until, one day, something
extraordinary happened.

00:21.588 --> 00:24.291
Or so the legend goes.

00:44.311 --> 00:48.815

have flooded in,

00:48.815 --> 00:52.352
searching for
some cosmic phenomenon

00:52.352 --> 00:56.423
to prove we're not all alone
in the universe.

00:56.423 --> 00:59.927
As a kid, I was searching, too,
in my own way,

00:59.927 --> 01:04.531
until I realized that
Roswell is just a small town,

01:04.531 --> 01:07.734
full of small tragedies
and small people,

01:07.734 --> 01:11.838

Right.

I'm just a distraction.

24:34.173 --> 24:36.175
No. No. Use me.

24:36.175 --> 24:38.310
Okay.
Use me. Absolutely.

24:43.582 --> 24:47.653
Whoa. Liz.
What happened?

24:47.653 --> 24:50.622
Uh, nothing.

24:50.622 --> 24:53.726
This is probably
a bad idea.

24:55.794 --> 24:58.397

said that earlier.

25:28.193 --> 25:29.828
Ever since the blackout
the other night,

25:29.828 --> 25:32.364
it's been off the charts
here in old Roswell.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.836
I'm telling you,
aliens are coming.

25:37.836 --> 25:41.940
And when they do,
they're gonna rape and murder

25:41.940 --> 25:44.443
and steal our jobs!

25:44.443 --> 25:45.978
(bell jingles)

25:45.978 --> 25:47.780

25:47.780 --> 25:49.648

for you.

25:49.648 --> 25:52.117

26:09.334 --> 26:10.769

26:10.769 --> 26:11.904
Right.

26:11.904 --> 26:14.773

my dad was dying,

26:14.773 --> 26:17.409
he was barely coherent
toward the end there,

26:17.409 --> 26:20.712
but he'd repeat
this crazy mantra.

26:20.712 --> 26:25.284
"If you see the
handprint, go to Manes."

26:26.485 --> 26:29.321

26:29.321 --> 26:32.291
With all due respect, sir,

26:32.291 --> 26:35.294
I'm gonna need a
few answers first.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.129
I did get shot,
didn't I?

26:37.129 --> 26:38.497
I told you
I'll explain everything

26:38.497 --> 26:40.399
when we get up there.
I'm an idiot.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.668
Who goes wandering
in the desert with a stranger?

26:42.668 --> 26:45.103
I'm not a stranger.
This town makes me stupid.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.573
I will never understand
why anyone ever stays here.

26:47.573 --> 26:49.708
I stay here
because I like it.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.712
Look, I know people were
terrible to you when Rosa died.

26:53.712 --> 26:57.015
But people here
are good to me.

26:57.015 --> 26:58.584
My family's happy.

26:58.584 --> 27:00.786
You know, Isobel and
Michael won't leave.

27:00.786 --> 27:03.989
Why? Michael outscored me
on every AP exam. He--

27:03.989 --> 27:06.425
I thought he would get some
scholarship, change the world.

27:06.425 --> 27:08.594
I don't think Michael
likes the world enough

27:08.594 --> 27:10.095
to bother changing it.

LIZ: (sighs) Any indication
that you're not gonna murder me

27:33.552 --> 27:37.022
and bury my body 20 feet beneath
the desert would be super.

27:37.022 --> 27:40.025
You're gonna need to see this
to believe it.

27:46.932 --> 27:50.836
We think these are what kept
us safe during the crash.

27:50.836 --> 27:53.539
The crash?

27:54.373 --> 27:57.276
1947 UFO crash.

28:04.116 --> 28:06.118
What are you, Max?

28:06.118 --> 28:08.253
You already know
the legend.

28:08.253 --> 28:10.188
But 50 years after
the incident,

28:10.188 --> 28:13.125
in 1997, I woke
up in here,

28:13.125 --> 28:15.160
in one of those.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.563
Michael and Isobel, too.

28:17.563 --> 28:20.299
We had no memories
or rudimentary skills,

28:20.299 --> 28:21.400
just each other.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.101
A long-haul trucker found us,

28:23.101 --> 28:25.771
naked, mute,
wandering the desert.

28:25.771 --> 28:30.208
Our parents adopted
Isobel and me, but...

28:30.208 --> 28:31.710
Michael was harder to place.

28:31.710 --> 28:36.081
He, uh, he ended up
in foster care.

28:36.081 --> 28:38.216
And we just assimilated.

28:38.216 --> 28:41.186
Swore to keep
our secret.

28:41.186 --> 28:43.622
You're telling me
you're an alien?

28:46.191 --> 28:48.460
I know it sounds crazy.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.762
I... spent the last two days

28:50.762 --> 28:53.799
thinking that I needed
to have myself committed.

28:53.799 --> 28:55.801
This is...

28:55.801 --> 28:58.103
better than that.

28:59.171 --> 29:00.572
I mean,

29:00.572 --> 29:02.574
your squamous epithelial cells
are not human.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.876
Of course you stole my cells.

29:04.876 --> 29:08.547
Magical healing
does not make sense to me.

29:08.547 --> 29:09.881
DNA does.

29:09.881 --> 29:13.752
You know, it's the science
that scares us the most.

29:13.752 --> 29:17.623
We've always been terrified
that if anyone found out,

29:17.623 --> 29:21.293
they'd put us in a lab
and, I don't know...

29:21.293 --> 29:24.596
cut us up, experiment.

29:24.596 --> 29:27.332
Nothing has ever mattered
to me more than protecting

29:27.332 --> 29:29.701
Michael and Isobel
from that, until...

29:29.701 --> 29:33.305
I saw you bleeding,
and I just...

29:33.305 --> 29:35.173
I'll keep your secret, Max.

29:38.176 --> 29:41.079
I promise you.

29:49.388 --> 29:51.189
(engine turns off, doors close)

29:51.189 --> 29:53.525
You know, I was gonna
spend my Saturday night

29:53.525 --> 29:55.227

29:55.227 --> 29:57.195
I've been working out.
I'm a surgeon.

29:57.195 --> 29:59.698

been in the business

30:04.636 --> 30:06.271

your ancestors and mine
