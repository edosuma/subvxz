02:07.405 --> 02:09.439
<i>The surface of the earth...</i>

02:09.574 --> 02:10.806
<i>is 30 percent land...</i>

02:10.941 --> 02:13.309
<i>and 70 percent water.</i>

02:13.443 --> 02:16.279
<i>A newborn baby is composed
of 70 percent water...</i>

02:16.413 --> 02:17.512
<i>and 30 percent
everything else.</i>

02:19.215 --> 02:21.449
<i>I guess this means...</i>

02:21.584 --> 02:23.884
<i>that life and water
are inseparable.</i>

02:24.019 --> 02:26.720
<i>A human child at birth
undergoes a ritual...</i>

02:26.855 --> 02:30.623
<i>almost identical to that
inflicted upon a trout at death.</i>

02:30.758 --> 02:32.592
<i>The fish is whacked
on the head...</i>

02:32.726 --> 02:34.560
<i>thus putting it
out of its misery.</i>

02:34.695 --> 02:35.862
<i>The infant is whacked
on the behind...</i>

02:37.764 --> 02:39.464
<i>thus initiating it
into its misery.</i>

02:42.135 --> 02:45.836
<i>Upon my birth, my father
made sure that I was given...</i>

02:45.971 --> 02:49.573
<i>the proud, manly name
of Augustine.</i>

02:49.707 --> 02:53.109
<i>And since I was born into
the first family of angling...</i>

02:53.244 --> 02:54.678
<i>it should come
as no surprise...</i>

02:54.812 --> 02:56.979
<i>that I was a fishing prodigy.</i>

02:57.113 --> 02:59.848
<i>I caught my first steelhead
with my mom...</i>

02:59.983 --> 03:03.284
<i>on a worm when I was four.</i>

03:03.419 --> 03:07.121
<i>I didn't feel any hostility
towards land dwellers.</i>

03:07.256 --> 03:10.257
<i>I just had water
on the brain.</i>

03:10.391 --> 03:12.459
<i>The only thing I gave
much thought to...</i>

03:12.593 --> 03:17.863
<i>was bait versus fly.</i>

03:17.998 --> 03:19.498
<i>On my tenth birthday...</i>

03:19.633 --> 03:22.534
<i>I caught my 180th steelhead
with my dad...</i>

03:22.668 --> 03:24.569
<i>on a fly.</i>

03:24.704 --> 03:26.905
<i>By the time high school
rolled around...</i>

03:27.039 --> 03:29.340
<i>I was great
at attracting steelhead.</i>

03:29.474 --> 03:31.508
<i>Not so great
with the cheerleaders.</i>

03:31.643 --> 03:34.244
<i>And when most kids
were making college plans...</i>

03:34.379 --> 03:35.278
<i>I didn't bother.</i>

03:35.412 --> 03:36.412
<i>Gross.</i>

03:36.547 --> 03:38.047
<i>Figured the only
institution...</i>

03:38.182 --> 03:39.382
<i>my grades would get me in...</i>

03:39.516 --> 03:42.517
<i>was the Oregon State Pen.</i>

03:42.652 --> 03:43.919
<i>But on water?</i>

03:44.053 --> 03:47.556
<i>I understand
the way fish think.</i>

03:47.690 --> 03:50.191
<i>My parents' union...</i>

03:50.325 --> 03:53.060
<i>is one of stubborn,
extremely loyal...</i>

03:53.195 --> 03:56.463
<i>hot-tempered,
polar opposites.</i>

03:56.597 --> 03:58.598
<i>Ma is a bait fisher...</i>

03:58.733 --> 04:02.534
<i>an expert plunker of worms.</i>

04:02.669 --> 04:05.637
<i>My father
is a writer secondarily...</i>

04:05.772 --> 04:09.374
<i>and a famous
fly fisherman primarily.</i>

04:09.508 --> 04:11.509
<i>My brother Bill Bob
is different...</i>

04:11.643 --> 04:12.877
<i>than the rest of us.</i>

04:13.012 --> 04:16.012
<i>He was born
with a prodigious ability...</i>

04:16.147 --> 04:18.815
<i>to ignore
all things aquatic...</i>

04:18.950 --> 04:22.785
<i>which to a massive extent
implies his entire family.</i>

04:22.919 --> 04:24.220
<i>He hates water.
Won't drink it.</i>

04:25.455 --> 04:26.922
<i>He wears galoshes and a hat...</i>

04:27.057 --> 04:28.223
<i>almost every day...</i>

04:28.357 --> 04:29.557
<i>just to stay clear
of the stuff.</i>

04:31.227 --> 04:33.294
<i>Not that he doesn't need
a little protection...</i>

04:33.429 --> 04:34.962
<i>from other hazards
now and then.</i>

04:35.096 --> 04:37.698
<i>Good thing Ma has
native intelligence.</i>

04:37.832 --> 04:39.099
<i>And she always seems to be</i>

04:39.234 --> 04:41.000
<i>in the right place
at the right time.</i>

05:18.901 --> 05:20.200
<i>My father's battle...</i>

05:20.334 --> 05:22.436
<i>with a giant steelhead
he named Nijinsky...</i>

05:22.570 --> 05:24.871
<i>was the stuff of legends.</i>

05:25.006 --> 05:28.474
<i>And the story of that fish
brought him fame, fortune...</i>

05:28.608 --> 05:30.843
<i>and a healthy ego.</i>

05:30.977 --> 05:32.544
<i>Raised by
English aristocrats...</i>

05:32.678 --> 05:35.947
<i>he inherited their speech
and manners.</i>

05:36.082 --> 05:39.183
<i>When he autographs a book,
he writes his entire name...</i>

05:39.317 --> 05:41.485
<i>Henning Hale Orviston.</i>

05:41.619 --> 05:42.986
<i>To approach every task-</i>

05:43.121 --> 05:44.822
<i>I call him H20.</i>

05:44.956 --> 05:47.256
<i>He's the one person
in the world...</i>

05:47.391 --> 05:49.692
<i>who calls me by the name
on my birth certificate.</i>

05:49.827 --> 05:51.726
<i>Augustine...</i>

05:51.861 --> 05:55.030
<i>best get another box
from the car.</i>

05:55.164 --> 05:57.866
<i>I just brought in three boxes.</i>

05:58.000 --> 06:00.267
<i>Tell you what, Augustine.</i>

06:00.402 --> 06:02.470
<i>Until you find someone else
to employ you...</i>

06:02.604 --> 06:06.239
<i>you might want to do
what I request.</i>

06:06.373 --> 06:08.775
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

06:11.078 --> 06:12.678
<i>Do you have children?</i>

06:12.812 --> 06:14.079
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

06:37.933 --> 06:39.734
<i>Before I take
a few questions...</i>

06:39.869 --> 06:41.069
<i>let me conclude by saying...</i>

06:41.203 --> 06:43.171
<i>I like to think
of this legislation...</i>

06:43.305 --> 06:46.039
<i>as the Worship the Waters Act.</i>

06:46.174 --> 06:47.975
<i>Yes, little lady.</i>

06:48.109 --> 06:50.610
<i>Hi. Um, curious.</i>

06:50.744 --> 06:54.447
<i>How can building all those
new dams be an act of worship?</i>

06:54.581 --> 06:58.350
<i>I mean, even if the wild salmon
are lucky enough to survive...</i>

06:58.484 --> 07:00.852
<i>the turbines on their
pilgrimage up the river...</i>

07:00.987 --> 07:03.054
<i>their smolt will be
swallowed, of course...</i>

07:03.188 --> 07:05.990
<i>by the predators on their
way back to the ocean.</i>

07:06.124 --> 07:10.627
<i>Maybe we should call it the
Slaughter the Salmon Act instead.</i>

07:10.761 --> 07:13.263
<i>There may be some collateral
damage to the salmon...</i>

07:13.397 --> 07:17.299
<i>but this will create jobs
and cut taxes, and besides...</i>

07:17.433 --> 07:20.235
<i>we are making great strides
with aquaculture these days.</i>

07:20.370 --> 07:21.637
<i>You'd be amazed
what we're doing...</i>

07:21.771 --> 07:23.004
<i>with farmed salmon.</i>

07:23.138 --> 07:24.772
<i>There's
no smoking here.</i>

07:24.907 --> 07:26.107
<i>You need
to put that out.</i>

07:26.241 --> 07:27.808
<i>Of course.
The environment.</i>

07:27.943 --> 07:28.843
<i>Come on.</i>

07:28.977 --> 07:30.210
<i>Certainly.</i>

07:30.344 --> 07:32.679
<i>Let's go.
Come one.</i>

07:32.813 --> 07:34.314
<i>There's no evidence...</i>

07:34.448 --> 07:36.815
<i>that consuming farmed
salmon poses any threat.</i>

07:36.950 --> 07:39.218
<i>Yeah, you and I
can debate that.</i>

07:39.352 --> 07:42.187
<i>But we can both agree that fish
have better places to live...</i>

07:42.321 --> 07:44.889
<i>than pools
of their own shit!</i>

07:56.366 --> 07:58.834
<i>Where are
my books, Augustine?</i>

07:58.969 --> 08:01.404
<i>My name is Gus!</i>

08:04.807 --> 08:06.942
<i>¶¶And none may come for days ¶¶</i>

08:07.076 --> 08:08.209
<i>Sorry.</i>

08:08.343 --> 08:09.710
<i>Sorry.</i>

08:38.369 --> 08:40.903
<i>My parents argued
about a lot of things.</i>

08:41.037 --> 08:44.440
<i>But it was never a question of
who would have the last word...</i>

08:44.574 --> 08:46.642
<i>merely who would have
the next one.</i>

08:48.611 --> 08:51.279
<i>How could I tell them I was
thinking about leaving home...</i>

08:51.413 --> 08:54.381
<i>when I couldn't even
get a word in edgewise.</i>

09:04.358 --> 09:06.325
<i>So, Hen...</i>

09:06.460 --> 09:10.495
<i>have you ever been
to Royal Lake?</i>

09:10.630 --> 09:11.997
<i>If I have...</i>

09:12.131 --> 09:13.764
<i>the brain cells
recollecting it...</i>

09:13.898 --> 09:19.003
<i>have been destroyed
by this merciful beverage.</i>

09:19.137 --> 09:21.304
<i>So go ahead, Gusser.</i>

09:21.438 --> 09:22.905
<i>Tell him
about that record bass...</i>

09:23.040 --> 09:24.741
<i>you and Bill Bob pulled
out of there that time.</i>

09:24.875 --> 09:26.042
<i>Ma.</i>

09:26.175 --> 09:28.310
<i>Augustine, you call
yourself a fisherman?</i>

09:28.444 --> 09:30.545
<i>I call myself Gus.</i>

09:30.680 --> 09:33.814
<i>Well, Gus...</i>

09:33.949 --> 09:36.117
<i>why were you fishing
for bass?</i>

09:36.251 --> 09:38.152
<i>Dutch Hines says that-</i>

09:38.287 --> 09:40.453
<i>Dutch Hines is an idiot.
What does he know? Bass.</i>

09:40.588 --> 09:42.155
<i>Bass!</i>

09:42.290 --> 09:44.591
<i>It's been said
that a man with a Bible...</i>

09:44.725 --> 09:47.026
<i>is more dangerous
than a man with a gun.</i>

09:47.160 --> 09:49.928
<i>Izaak Walton's
The Compleat Angler...</i>

09:50.063 --> 09:52.064
<i>was my father's Bible.</i>

09:52.197 --> 09:54.399
<i>"The king of fish,
the trout. "</i>

09:54.533 --> 09:56.768
<i>And since the time
I was a toddler...</i>

09:56.902 --> 09:59.469
<i>I heard it quoted
and misquoted daily.</i>

09:59.604 --> 10:04.241
<i>"via the fly rod, the most
aesthetically perfect experience...</i>

10:04.375 --> 10:07.877
<i>available to mortal-"
Don't break my book.</i>

10:08.011 --> 10:11.646
<i>Don't worry about
your stupid book. Here.</i>

10:11.781 --> 10:13.948
<i>"Come. Let's
kill them all.</i>

10:14.083 --> 10:16.718
<i>"Then let's go find
an honest alehouse...</i>

10:16.852 --> 10:19.553
<i>"where we may drink
a cup of barley wine...</i>

10:19.688 --> 10:20.988
<i>and rejoice together. "</i>

10:21.122 --> 10:21.889
<i>Completely mistaken.</i>

10:22.023 --> 10:23.090
<i>I swear, Hen.</i>

10:23.224 --> 10:24.558
<i>You've taken
his facetious humor...</i>

10:24.692 --> 10:26.492
<i>and turned it into
a mortal condemnation.</i>

10:26.627 --> 10:28.461
<i>You bribed your
teacher for your diploma.</i>

10:28.595 --> 10:30.763
<i>Shows a lack of humor.
The trout-</i>

10:30.898 --> 10:33.065
<i>Ike Walton wrote all
that about fly fishing...</i>

10:33.199 --> 10:35.434
<i>just so he could make
some extra pocket money.</i>

10:48.279 --> 10:50.813
<i>Stop! Just
shut up! Stop.</i>

10:56.453 --> 11:00.188
<i>What would you think of me
if I didn't fly fish?</i>

11:00.322 --> 11:02.323
<i>You know what you are?
You're a fishing fascist.</i>

11:02.458 --> 11:05.192
<i>You're a diarrhea-mouthed
bigot who's blind to anyone...</i>

11:05.326 --> 11:09.329
<i>who doesn't drool over the
sound of your stupid, suave talk.</i>

11:09.464 --> 11:11.097
<i>The only person you
love is yourself...</i>

11:11.231 --> 11:13.232
<i>because you've got your head
so far up your own ass-</i>

11:13.367 --> 11:14.667
<i>All right now,
Gus Orviston...</i>

11:14.801 --> 11:16.601
<i>that's no way
to talk to your father.</i>

11:16.736 --> 11:18.236
<i>What in hell's
gotten into you?</i>

11:18.371 --> 11:20.338
<i>You're a greedy,
gloating shrew...</i>

11:20.473 --> 11:22.741
<i>and you don't know shit
about fishing or living.</i>

11:22.875 --> 11:24.908
<i>Neither one of you do
because you're just both...</i>

11:25.043 --> 11:26.076
<i>dug so deep
in your ruts...</i>

11:26.211 --> 11:27.745
<i>that you've got mud
in your ears.</i>

11:44.726 --> 11:46.660
<i>I gotta
get out of here.</i>

11:46.795 --> 11:48.896
<i>See this?</i>

11:49.030 --> 11:51.664
<i>No no no,
not Nijinsky.</i>

11:51.799 --> 11:54.033
<i>This is the source
of all your bullshit.</i>

11:56.503 --> 11:59.805
<i>Nijinsky was an honored
part of our family...</i>

11:59.939 --> 12:03.040
<i>since before
I was even born.</i>

12:03.175 --> 12:04.442
<i>And even though his body...</i>

12:04.576 --> 12:06.511
<i>was stuck
over the living room mantle...</i>

12:06.645 --> 12:09.780
<i>his spirit haunted
every corner of my life.</i>

12:12.383 --> 12:15.351
<i>What can you say after you've
spontaneously cremated...</i>

12:15.485 --> 12:18.354
<i>your parent's prized fish
in the fireplace?</i>

12:18.488 --> 12:20.189
<i>The only thing
that came to my mind</i>

12:20.323 --> 12:22.857
<i>was "Good-bye. "</i>

12:24.393 --> 12:26.995
<i>For me, happiness
would never be found...</i>

12:27.129 --> 12:29.897
<i>anywhere but on the banks
of a river anyway.</i>

12:30.031 --> 12:31.498
<i>So I took the few
possessions I owned-</i>

12:31.633 --> 12:32.566
<i>Bye, Gus.</i>

12:32.700 --> 12:34.234
<i>and turned to the river.</i>

12:34.369 --> 12:37.403
<i>And to a new life devoid of
every obstacle between me...</i>

12:37.538 --> 12:41.139
<i>and my beloved
art of angling.</i>

12:46.379 --> 12:48.612
<i>¶¶I will ask it plain ¶¶</i>

12:48.747 --> 12:53.451
<i>¶¶'Cause I just have
One way to speak ¶¶</i>

12:53.585 --> 12:55.285
<i>¶¶Help to make me strong ¶¶</i>

12:55.419 --> 12:59.956
<i>¶¶Because this world
Has made me weak ¶¶</i>

13:00.090 --> 13:02.958
<i>¶¶I remember
when I started out ¶¶</i>

13:03.092 --> 13:06.695
<i>¶¶There wasn't anything ¶¶</i>

13:06.830 --> 13:09.697
<i>¶¶Any man or any country ¶¶</i>

13:09.832 --> 13:14.601
<i>¶¶Any court or any king ¶¶</i>

13:14.735 --> 13:17.704
<i>¶¶That ever kept me ¶¶</i>

13:17.839 --> 13:21.607
<i>¶¶From my calling ¶¶</i>

13:21.741 --> 13:24.243
<i>¶¶Oh ¶¶</i>

13:26.046 --> 13:28.246
<i>¶¶No wall so tall ¶¶</i>

13:28.380 --> 13:32.617
<i>¶¶I could not scale ¶¶</i>

13:36.888 --> 13:39.323
<i>¶¶But now I feel ¶¶</i>

13:39.457 --> 13:44.160
<i>¶¶Like I am falling ¶¶</i>

13:44.294 --> 13:46.394
<i>¶¶Oh ¶¶</i>

13:46.529 --> 13:49.035
<i>¶¶Lord, don't let me fail ¶¶</i>

13:54.669 --> 13:57.271
<i>¶¶Let me run like
I'm a river ¶¶</i>

13:57.405 --> 14:01.674
<i>¶¶Let me travel
Like a trail ¶¶</i>

14:01.809 --> 14:04.314
<i>¶¶Lord don't let it fail ¶¶</i>

14:09.249 --> 14:11.817
<i>¶¶Let me run
Like I'm a river ¶¶</i>

14:11.951 --> 14:15.987
<i>¶¶Let me travel
Like a train ¶¶</i>

14:16.121 --> 14:18.356
<i>¶¶Let me run
like I'm a river ¶¶</i>

14:18.490 --> 14:22.659
<i>¶¶Let me travel
Like a train ¶¶</i>

14:22.793 --> 14:25.427
<i>¶¶Let me run
like I'm a river ¶¶</i>

14:25.562 --> 14:29.064
<i>¶¶Let me travel ¶¶</i>

14:29.199 --> 14:33.568
<i>¶¶¶¶Travel like a train ¶¶¶¶</i>

16:39.442 --> 16:41.709
<i>There's just nothing
like the feel...</i>

16:41.844 --> 16:43.811
<i>of a trout dancing
through the river...</i>

16:43.946 --> 16:46.881
<i>making the pole pulse
like a heart in your hands.</i>

16:48.483 --> 16:49.850
<i>It does to your hands...</i>

16:49.984 --> 16:52.119
<i>what dreams of eternity
do to your heart.</i>

16:52.253 --> 16:55.354
<i>And yet, I killed the trout.</i>

16:55.489 --> 16:58.290
<i>It's strange to kill
your dance partner...</i>

16:58.425 --> 17:00.726
<i>but that's what I did.</i>

17:00.861 --> 17:02.727
<i>I did it because the world
is strange.</i>

17:02.862 --> 17:05.829
<i>Because the world does not allow
you to make up your own rules...</i>

17:05.964 --> 17:07.998
<i>based on how you would
wish things to be.</i>

17:08.133 --> 17:10.800
<i>Because this is a world
where no matter who you are...</i>

17:10.935 --> 17:13.337
<i>your happiness,
your survival...</i>

17:13.471 --> 17:16.571
<i>is based on sacrifice.</i>

17:16.707 --> 17:20.443
<i>Sweet, bleeding sacrifice.</i>

17:35.389 --> 17:37.390
<i>Nice work, son.</i>

17:38.759 --> 17:41.660
<i>Very nice.</i>

17:41.795 --> 17:43.862
<i>How many you got?</i>

17:43.997 --> 17:45.664
<i>About a hundred.</i>

17:45.799 --> 17:48.966
<i>I'll take 'em all.</i>

17:49.101 --> 17:50.768
<i>Great!</i>

17:52.671 --> 17:55.672
<i>Hey! Stop!</i>

17:55.807 --> 17:57.374
<i>Hey.</i>

17:57.508 --> 17:58.341
<i>Howdy there.</i>

17:58.476 --> 17:59.642
<i>Howdy.</i>

17:59.776 --> 18:02.578
<i>Hi. My
name's Kernie.</i>

18:02.713 --> 18:04.714
<i>And, uh,
this is Bernie...</i>

18:04.848 --> 18:07.182
<i>and Marlene and Charlene and Darlene...</i>

18:07.316 --> 18:09.818
<i>and this one right
here is Ernie...</i>

18:09.952 --> 18:12.187
<i>except we call him
Hemingway for short.</i>

18:12.321 --> 18:13.420
<i>I'm Gus.</i>

18:13.555 --> 18:14.988
<i>Oh, yeah. Yeah,
yeah, we know.</i>

18:15.123 --> 18:17.391
<i>Yeah, you live right up there, upstream</i>

18:17.525 --> 18:18.525
<i>by the reef forest.</i>

18:18.660 --> 18:21.794
<i>Hey, uh...</i>

18:21.929 --> 18:23.029
<i>maybe,
do you guys...</i>

18:23.163 --> 18:26.064
<i>want some fish,
smoked fish-</i>

18:26.199 --> 18:27.332
<i>Yeah! Yeah!</i>

18:27.467 --> 18:29.301
<i>No, no, no. Don't grab, don't grab.</i>

18:29.435 --> 18:33.304
<i>Well, while you guys
pick at that, I'm gonna...</i>

18:33.438 --> 18:34.271
<i>move on
down the road.</i>

18:34.406 --> 18:35.740
<i>Oh, wait.
No, no, no.</i>

18:35.874 --> 18:39.109
<i>We got some stuff for
you. Just wait right here.</i>

18:43.581 --> 18:45.214
<i>Hey, you like fishing?</i>

18:45.348 --> 18:47.750
<i>If you ever want a lesson
or anything, you know...</i>

18:47.884 --> 18:49.585
<i>you can just
come by my cabin.</i>

18:50.954 --> 18:51.719
<i>Here you go.</i>

18:51.754 --> 18:52.987
<i>Oh, whoa.</i>

18:53.122 --> 18:54.956
<i>These are brand-new,
so they're really good.</i>

18:55.090 --> 18:56.424
<i>Wow, thank you.
Okay. Wow.</i>

18:56.558 --> 18:57.859
<i>Hello.</i>

18:57.992 --> 19:00.694
<i>Wow. This is really-
I don't- I can't-</i>

19:00.828 --> 19:02.996
<i>Oh, no, no, no. It's good, it's good.</i>

19:03.131 --> 19:04.231
<i>It's great.</i>

19:04.365 --> 19:05.364
<i>You're fine.</i>

19:05.499 --> 19:06.465
<i>Hi, I'm Gus.</i>

19:06.600 --> 19:07.666
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

19:07.801 --> 19:09.101
<i>Thank you.</i>

19:10.670 --> 19:11.770
<i>Bye.</i>

19:11.904 --> 19:13.638
<i>Thank you.
Nice meeting you.</i>

19:30.087 --> 19:32.220
<i>Nice job, Rodney.</i>

20:39.445 --> 20:40.612
<i>Alfred
I promise...</i>

20:40.746 --> 20:42.847
<i>I'll eat
something else tomorrow.</i>

21:32.290 --> 21:34.891
<i>Abe, are you out there?</i>

21:35.025 --> 21:38.361
<i>Abe! Are you all right?</i>

21:38.495 --> 21:40.528
<i>Hey, have you seen
a lone fisherman?</i>

21:40.663 --> 21:43.531
<i>Sorry. I haven't
seen anyone.</i>

21:43.666 --> 21:45.934
<i>Abe!</i>

21:46.068 --> 21:50.671
<i>Abe!</i>

21:50.805 --> 21:54.474
<i>Abe, where are you?</i>

21:54.608 --> 21:57.510
<i>Abe, come on!</i>

22:00.446 --> 22:02.414
<i>Abe!</i>

22:58.629 --> 22:59.796
<i>Oh!</i>

23:12.341 --> 23:14.208
<i>Oh!</i>

24:24.835 --> 24:28.405
<i>There's one thing
you can say about nature.</i>

24:28.539 --> 24:32.975
<i>If you make one lousy rule
to describe it...</i>

24:33.109 --> 24:37.078
<i>it'll contradict you even if
it has to bust its ass to do so.</i>

24:37.212 --> 24:41.949
<i>And so what? If anybody ever
discovered the real laws of nature...</i>

24:42.084 --> 24:44.284
<i>nature would rear back
and strike him dead...</i>

24:44.419 --> 24:45.952
<i>before he could
pass on the news.</i>

24:46.087 --> 24:47.821
<i>Jesus Christ.</i>

24:47.955 --> 24:50.523
<i>No. I think
his name is Abe.</i>

24:52.392 --> 24:55.361
<i>Maybe Abe knew.</i>

24:55.494 --> 24:58.029
<i>Maybe he had just figured
the whole world out...</i>

24:58.164 --> 25:01.499
<i>and was about to tell me
as I floated past.</i>

25:01.634 --> 25:04.568
<i>But God caught wind of it and
stuck out His invisible foot...</i>

25:04.702 --> 25:07.204
<i>tripped and drowned him.</i>

25:09.373 --> 25:12.442
<i>If the fool only knew
how to swim.</i>

25:24.453 --> 25:27.954
<i>Easy, friend.</i>

25:28.089 --> 25:31.391
<i>Let's see if we can
thaw you out.</i>

25:38.798 --> 25:40.132
<i>I am Titus.</i>

25:40.266 --> 25:44.068
<i>Titus I rving Gerrard.
At your service.</i>

25:44.203 --> 25:47.504
<i>Nice to meet you. I...</i>

25:47.638 --> 25:48.839
<i>am simply Gus.</i>

25:48.973 --> 25:50.774
<i>Simply Gus?
I don't think so.</i>

25:50.908 --> 25:52.342
<i>Anyone who knows
the secrets...</i>

25:52.477 --> 25:54.076
<i>to the catches
you made today...</i>

25:54.211 --> 25:55.311
<i>is not simply anything.</i>

25:55.445 --> 25:57.146
<i>There's no secrets
to those catches.</i>

25:57.280 --> 25:59.415
<i>The trout I caught
on a wet fly.</i>

25:59.549 --> 26:01.783
<i>The corpse I caught
on a soggy dry.</i>

26:01.917 --> 26:03.151
<i>Yes, well...</i>

26:03.285 --> 26:06.454
<i>you've done old Abe's
family some service...</i>

26:06.589 --> 26:07.921
<i>by collecting his remains.</i>

26:08.056 --> 26:10.858
<i>And since we're all bodily
destined for corpsehood...</i>

26:10.992 --> 26:13.227
<i>and spiritually possessed
of immortal souls...</i>

26:13.361 --> 26:16.496
<i>I see no reason to let the
proximity of corpses ruin our day.</i>

26:16.630 --> 26:19.132
<i>If you think we're all
possessed by immortal souls...</i>

26:19.266 --> 26:20.665
<i>I'd sure like
to see them.</i>

26:20.800 --> 26:23.869
<i>Maybe you're looking
in the wrong places.</i>

26:35.579 --> 26:38.515
<i>For clear vision.</i>

26:38.649 --> 26:40.182
<i>Thanks.</i>

26:40.316 --> 26:42.651
<i>M m-hm.</i>

26:42.785 --> 26:46.387
<i>And uh,
thanks for the ride.</i>

27:25.621 --> 27:27.422
<i>A fisherman is dead.</i>

27:30.560 --> 27:34.061
<i>Everyone I know
will one day be dead.</i>

27:34.196 --> 27:35.996
<i>What can I do about it?</i>

27:36.131 --> 27:39.032
<i>Death is the most natural
thing there is...</i>

27:39.166 --> 27:41.768
<i>and we all have a knack for
it. The only question is...</i>

27:41.902 --> 27:45.671
<i>when we'll master it.
Doesn't matter what we do...</i>

27:45.805 --> 27:48.273
<i>or what we don't do.</i>

27:51.376 --> 27:55.713
<i>This is no passing thought.</i>

27:55.847 --> 28:00.217
<i>It's a gnawing emptiness
more real than the cold.</i>

28:18.566 --> 28:21.868
<i>This is bullshit.</i>

28:23.870 --> 28:26.105
<i>Ma tossed
the baby rabbit skeleton...</i>

28:26.240 --> 28:27.907
<i>I had hanging in my closet.</i>

28:35.615 --> 28:37.548
<i>Is that tonight's dreefee?</i>

28:37.682 --> 28:38.949
<i>Yep.</i>

28:39.084 --> 28:40.851
<i>I had to get a new one.</i>

28:40.986 --> 28:44.320
<i>Whatever helps you sleep,
Bill Bob.</i>

28:44.455 --> 28:45.488
<i>Gussy?</i>

28:45.623 --> 28:48.324
<i>Bill Bob?</i>

28:48.459 --> 28:50.058
<i>I thought it might make
you feel better...</i>

28:50.193 --> 28:52.194
<i>to explain that you've
got a garden angel.</i>

28:52.328 --> 28:53.629
<i>You mean guardian angel?</i>

28:53.763 --> 28:56.831
<i>Nah. See, you think
you're alone.</i>

28:56.965 --> 28:59.834
<i>But you're not.
You've got a garden angel...</i>

28:59.968 --> 29:02.270
<i>that's your twin.</i>

29:02.403 --> 29:04.104
<i>It's called a guardian angel.</i>

29:04.238 --> 29:06.606
<i>No. I'm talking
about a garden angel.</i>

29:06.741 --> 29:09.842
<i>It's like your shadow.</i>

29:26.724 --> 29:28.557
<i>Dreefee.</i>

29:42.904 --> 29:45.606
<i>Garden angel.</i>

29:45.740 --> 29:49.242
<i>Gussy, garden angels
come from the ground...</i>

29:49.376 --> 29:50.910
<i>like carrots.</i>

29:51.045 --> 29:52.945
<i>When they first
come out of the ground...</i>

29:53.080 --> 29:55.113
<i>into the garden world,
they're very old...</i>

29:55.248 --> 29:56.848
<i>or hurt, or sick.</i>

29:56.983 --> 29:58.550
<i>And the longer
the angels live there...</i>

29:58.685 --> 29:59.918
<i>the younger and smaller
they grow</i>

30:00.053 --> 30:01.485
<i>and happier and friendlier
they get.</i>

30:01.620 --> 30:03.120
<i>When they get little little...</i>

30:03.255 --> 30:06.123
<i>they disappear out of the garden
world and into our world...</i>

30:06.258 --> 30:07.724
<i>and we trade places.</i>

30:07.858 --> 30:09.125
<i>We what?</i>

30:09.260 --> 30:11.461
<i>We trade places
with our twin.</i>

30:11.595 --> 30:13.496
<i>We go there and our twin comes here.</i>

30:13.631 --> 30:16.799
<i>We journey up and up
through a long black tunnel...</i>

30:16.933 --> 30:19.535
<i>till we reach
the garden angel grounds.</i>

30:19.669 --> 30:21.536
<i>Sprout up like carrots.</i>

30:21.670 --> 30:24.038
<i>Trade back and forth.</i>

30:24.173 --> 30:28.442
<i>Does knowing this make you feel
a little less lonely, Gussy?</i>

30:28.576 --> 30:30.277
<i>Yeah, Bill Bob.</i>

30:30.411 --> 30:32.145
<i>Thanks.</i>

32:51.497 --> 32:52.697
<i>Oh, sorry.</i>

32:52.832 --> 32:56.301
<i>Uh, I'm, uh-</i>

32:56.434 --> 32:57.968
<i>Don't get scared.</i>

32:58.102 --> 33:03.206
<i>I'm just- I'm just
a marmless misher-</i>

33:03.340 --> 33:06.409
<i>I just came here
to go swimming.</i>

33:13.049 --> 33:14.349
<i>Oops.</i>

33:14.484 --> 33:16.217
<i>I gotta go.</i>

33:16.351 --> 33:18.519
<i>You know, um-</i>

33:18.653 --> 33:20.788
<i>Do not- Uh.</i>

33:20.922 --> 33:22.922
<i>Bye.</i>

33:36.702 --> 33:38.002
<i>Hey!</i>

33:38.136 --> 33:40.838
<i>You all right up there?</i>

33:40.973 --> 33:42.205
<i>Yeah.</i>

33:42.340 --> 33:45.141
<i>Well, are you hurt?</i>

33:45.276 --> 33:47.811
<i>I- No- No!</i>

33:49.846 --> 33:52.147
<i>Can you get down?</i>

33:52.282 --> 33:54.817
<i>No.</i>

33:54.950 --> 33:57.952
<i>Why not?</i>

33:58.087 --> 33:59.854
<i>Just 'cause.</i>

33:59.989 --> 34:01.189
<i>All right, mummy mouth.</i>

34:01.323 --> 34:03.290
<i>If that's all you got
for me, good luck.</i>

34:03.424 --> 34:06.226
<i>No, no, no.
Don't go.</i>

34:06.361 --> 34:07.960
<i>Why not?</i>

34:08.094 --> 34:09.762
<i>"No life, good scholar...</i>

34:09.897 --> 34:12.331
<i>"no life so happy
and so pleasant...</i>

34:12.466 --> 34:14.799
<i>"as the life
of a well-governed angler.</i>

34:14.934 --> 34:16.801
<i>"So we may say that God
never did make...</i>

34:16.936 --> 34:20.170
<i>"a more calm, quiet...</i>

34:20.306 --> 34:24.775
<i>innocent recreation
than angling. "</i>

34:24.909 --> 34:26.409
<i>I don't suppose he did.</i>

34:26.545 --> 34:29.746
<i>And now, I think it's time...</i>

34:29.880 --> 34:31.581
<i>for you to repair
to your angle rod...</i>

34:31.715 --> 34:34.382
<i>which should not be left in
the water to fish for itself.</i>

34:34.516 --> 34:36.784
<i>Oh, yeah, is that what
we've been doing, huh?</i>

34:36.920 --> 34:39.454
<i>Funny, 'cause I thought...</i>

34:39.589 --> 34:41.355
<i>I was trying to catch me
a steelhead.</i>

34:41.489 --> 34:45.393
<i>And you, what are you
doing here?</i>

34:45.527 --> 34:48.661
<i>I am a fisherman, but I
only came here to swim.</i>

34:48.795 --> 34:51.498
<i>If you're a fisherman,
where's your gear?</i>

34:51.632 --> 34:54.300
<i>My gear is at home,
on the Tamanawis.</i>

34:54.434 --> 34:58.904
<i>"But let us say grace
and fall to breakfast.</i>

34:59.039 --> 35:00.471
<i>What say you, scholar?"</i>

35:00.606 --> 35:02.307
<i>You can say grace
all you want.</i>

35:02.441 --> 35:04.275
<i>Just don't fall
to breakfast, please.</i>

35:04.410 --> 35:07.377
<i>Why not?</i>

35:07.512 --> 35:09.513
<i>Because you're gonna
break your neck...</i>

35:09.647 --> 35:12.349
<i>before I figure out
that lingo of yours.</i>

35:12.483 --> 35:16.886
<i>It's Zizak Waltley.
I mean Zisac Walters-</i>

35:17.020 --> 35:19.088
<i>Izaak Walton?</i>

35:19.222 --> 35:22.524
<i>Yes!</i>

35:22.658 --> 35:24.626
<i>And what is your name?</i>

35:24.760 --> 35:26.293
<i>Crawl me Gust.</i>

35:26.428 --> 35:28.796
<i>Wh-Wh-Wh-What's
your name?</i>

35:31.099 --> 35:35.401
<i>Eddy.</i>

35:35.536 --> 35:37.470
<i>Just Eddy.
Nice to meet you.</i>

35:37.605 --> 35:41.173
<i>Eddy, like the swirvles
in the river wattle.</i>

35:41.307 --> 35:43.609
<i>I wish.</i>

35:43.743 --> 35:45.543
<i>No.</i>

35:45.677 --> 35:47.745
<i>Eddy like my dad, Edwin.</i>

35:51.216 --> 35:52.949
<i>You got- You got-
You got a bite.</i>

35:53.084 --> 35:54.484
<i>Hm?</i>

36:23.877 --> 36:25.410
<i>Where'd you go?</i>

38:02.460 --> 38:04.294
<i>Aiee!</i>

38:04.428 --> 38:07.597
<i>Sacajawea Argeiphontes!
I am wounded.</i>

38:07.732 --> 38:08.764
<i>Titus?</i>

38:21.009 --> 38:23.810
<i>The Sufi Attar
has written...</i>

38:23.945 --> 38:27.147
<i>"One tiny fly which
entered the ear of Nimrod...</i>

38:27.281 --> 38:29.815
<i>troubled the brain
of that idiot for centuries. "</i>

38:29.950 --> 38:33.719
<i>Please, Gus.
Spare me Nimrod's fate.</i>

38:35.888 --> 38:37.155
<i>It's hopeless.</i>

38:37.289 --> 38:39.691
<i>I'll never catch one
of those beautiful trout.</i>

38:39.825 --> 38:41.792
<i>Whoops. You just used
one of the two words...</i>

38:41.926 --> 38:45.496
<i>that should be deleted from
every true fisherman's vocabulary.</i>

38:45.630 --> 38:46.430
<i>Hopeless?</i>

38:46.564 --> 38:49.065
<i>No. Always and never.</i>

38:51.468 --> 38:52.335
<i>How's it feel?</i>

38:52.469 --> 38:53.802
<i>Eerie, thanks.</i>

38:53.936 --> 38:54.936
<i>Don't mention it.</i>

38:55.071 --> 38:57.973
<i>Consider it de-mentioned.</i>

38:58.107 --> 39:01.041
<i>What's that?</i>

39:01.176 --> 39:03.177
<i>It's a long, dull story.</i>

39:03.311 --> 39:05.946
<i>If I'm not mistaken,
I've seen that look before.</i>

39:06.081 --> 39:09.816
<i>Is there a woman in this?</i>

39:11.418 --> 39:13.086
<i>Twice she slipped
away now.</i>

39:13.220 --> 39:15.654
<i>She's uncatchable.</i>

39:15.789 --> 39:18.323
<i>Uncatchable
as in never?</i>

39:18.458 --> 39:21.459
<i>She's not a fish, Titus.</i>

39:21.593 --> 39:23.961
<i>Maybe not, but it
certainly sounds to me...</i>

39:24.096 --> 39:26.063
<i>like you're telling the story
of the one that got away.</i>

39:26.198 --> 39:28.265
<i>Live the rest of my life
without ever seeing...</i>

39:28.399 --> 39:30.066
<i>the beautiful
fisher girl again?</i>

39:30.201 --> 39:33.769
<i>That's- that's a pretty
miserable prospect.</i>

39:33.904 --> 39:35.237
<i>Well-</i>

39:35.372 --> 39:37.139
<i>I guess there's nothing
left to do...</i>

39:37.274 --> 39:39.641
<i>but just drink
till I die.</i>

39:41.443 --> 39:44.646
<i>I'll admit there is no cure
for a soul in your condition...</i>

39:44.780 --> 39:48.615
<i>but there are
three consolations.</i>

39:48.750 --> 39:51.351
<i>Okay.</i>

39:51.486 --> 39:54.353
<i>One is hope.
You may find her again.</i>

39:54.488 --> 39:56.088
<i>Yeah, fat chance.</i>

39:56.223 --> 39:59.291
<i>Gus, if she's as beautiful
as you say she is-</i>

39:59.425 --> 40:01.493
<i>She's twice as beautiful
as I say she is.</i>

40:01.627 --> 40:04.563
<i>She knows your name.
She knows the river.</i>

40:04.697 --> 40:05.696
<i>She may find you.</i>

40:05.831 --> 40:07.598
<i>Yeah. We may grow wings.</i>

40:07.732 --> 40:09.733
<i>We might.</i>

40:09.868 --> 40:14.137
<i>Okay. What are these
other two consolations?</i>

40:14.271 --> 40:17.540
<i>Well, you've already put down
a healthy dose of the second.</i>

40:17.675 --> 40:19.908
<i>The third, however,
requires more aptitude.</i>

40:20.043 --> 40:22.110
<i>What kind of aptitudes?</i>

40:22.245 --> 40:23.612
<i>Philosophical aptitude.</i>

40:23.746 --> 40:26.781
<i>Titus, I know how
to philosophize...</i>

40:26.915 --> 40:29.483
<i>as well as you
know how to fly cast.</i>

40:29.618 --> 40:32.519
<i>I think you should
get plowed tonight.</i>

40:32.653 --> 40:36.890
<i>And tomorrow,
we begin philosophizing.</i>

40:37.024 --> 40:38.090
<i>I just told you...</i>

40:38.225 --> 40:39.859
<i>I don't know
how to philosophize.</i>

40:39.993 --> 40:43.562
<i>Well, and I don't know
how to fish.</i>

40:43.697 --> 40:45.496
<i>Okay. So?</i>

40:45.631 --> 40:47.799
<i>So we teach each other.</i>

40:50.502 --> 40:52.336
<i>What have I got to lose?</i>

40:52.470 --> 40:55.839
<i>Your unhappiness.</i>

40:55.974 --> 40:58.007
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

41:03.247 --> 41:04.412
<i>What is that?</i>

41:04.547 --> 41:07.249
<i>Is that an imitation
of a grasshopper?</i>

41:07.383 --> 41:11.087
<i>This is an abstract
representation...</i>

41:13.722 --> 41:18.458
<i>of a fat tourist
on a golf course.</i>

41:18.592 --> 41:21.794
<i>It's called Bermuda shorts.</i>

41:21.929 --> 41:23.996
<i>Here, fishy.</i>

41:24.130 --> 41:27.132
<i>I like it. What say we
migrate to a watering hole...</i>

41:27.267 --> 41:29.867
<i>a little closer
to civilization?</i>

41:30.002 --> 41:31.369
<i>To Portland?</i>

41:31.503 --> 41:32.937
<i>Sure.</i>

41:33.071 --> 41:35.873
<i>The way that goes ahead often
looks as if it went back.</i>

41:36.008 --> 41:38.575
<i>I just want to go ahead
and find Eddy.</i>

41:39.877 --> 41:41.211
<i>Come on.</i>

42:15.507 --> 42:17.341
<i>Titus?</i>

42:18.710 --> 42:19.710
<i>Titus!</i>

42:19.844 --> 42:22.478
<i>Yes?</i>

42:22.613 --> 42:24.113
<i>Ah.</i>

42:24.248 --> 42:25.682
<i>This your dog?</i>

42:25.816 --> 42:26.883
<i>Yes.</i>

42:27.017 --> 42:29.584
<i>Well, he's kind of
staring at me.</i>

42:29.719 --> 42:30.719
<i>So?</i>

42:30.853 --> 42:32.254
<i>Does he bite?
Can I move? Or-</i>

42:32.388 --> 42:33.555
<i>Why won't he just
go away?</i>

42:33.690 --> 42:36.457
<i>He
- He doesn't bite without cause.</i>

42:36.591 --> 42:38.225
<i>But, uh,
you should move.</i>

42:38.360 --> 42:39.627
<i>You're in Descartes chair.</i>

42:40.896 --> 42:42.329
<i>Easy there, buddy.</i>

42:42.463 --> 42:46.199
<i>I'm just gonna move
over to the couch.</i>

42:46.334 --> 42:48.334
<i>And then Descartes'
silly chair...</i>

42:48.468 --> 42:51.003
<i>will be all fine.</i>

42:54.707 --> 42:55.773
<i>Uh, Titus?</i>

42:55.908 --> 42:59.510
<i>The dog's
in Descartes' chair now.</i>

42:59.645 --> 43:01.945
<i>And he's rocking. Should
I tell him to get down?</i>

43:02.080 --> 43:05.048
<i>No, you shouldn't.
The dog is Descartes.</i>

43:05.183 --> 43:08.050
<i>Oh.</i>

43:08.185 --> 43:09.652
<i>Well.</i>

43:09.786 --> 43:11.120
<i>This is amazing.</i>

43:11.254 --> 43:13.489
<i>How did you teach him to
rock a chair like that?</i>

43:13.623 --> 43:16.091
<i>Don't make a stew
about it, Gus.</i>

43:16.225 --> 43:18.560
<i>You'll only
confuse him.</i>

43:18.694 --> 43:21.628
<i>Descartes' immediate
goal is humanity...</i>

43:21.763 --> 43:23.831
<i>as surely as ours
is divinity.</i>

43:23.965 --> 43:26.933
<i>What?</i>

43:27.067 --> 43:28.301
<i>Sorry. I guess...</i>

43:28.435 --> 43:30.770
<i>I'm just from the orthodox
school, you know?</i>

43:30.904 --> 43:35.107
<i>Fido, Rover, fetch,
roll over.</i>

43:35.241 --> 43:37.976
<i>Well, Gus...</i>

43:38.111 --> 43:40.745
<i>are you ready to fish?</i>

43:40.879 --> 43:42.246
<i>Fish for what?</i>

43:42.381 --> 43:43.581
<i>For happiness.</i>

43:43.715 --> 43:48.251
<i>And where
do you fish for that?</i>

43:48.386 --> 43:51.221
<i>You believe that stuff?</i>

43:51.355 --> 43:53.789
<i>I'm not sane, Gus.</i>

43:53.923 --> 43:56.392
<i>I believe in the rivers
of living water.</i>

43:56.526 --> 43:59.327
<i>I believe our souls
swim in that water.</i>

43:59.461 --> 44:03.331
<i>I believe that Jesus,
Buddha, Krishna, Mohamed</i>

44:03.465 --> 44:05.433
<i>are the savor
in that water.</i>

44:05.567 --> 44:07.501
<i>Wish I believed that.</i>

44:07.635 --> 44:11.138
<i>And why don't you?</i>

44:11.272 --> 44:13.172
<i>Bait or fly.</i>

44:13.306 --> 44:15.241
<i>Fried or scrambled.</i>

44:15.375 --> 44:16.609
<i>Jesus or Mohamed.</i>

44:16.743 --> 44:18.110
<i>I mean, does it really
make any difference?</i>

44:18.245 --> 44:21.613
<i>Does it
really matter?</i>

44:21.747 --> 44:24.149
<i>Where are all these sages
and buddhas holing up...</i>

44:24.283 --> 44:27.284
<i>now when we really
need 'em?</i>

44:27.419 --> 44:30.621
<i>Well, would you know one
if you met one?</i>

44:30.755 --> 44:32.588
<i>Come on, Titus.</i>

44:32.723 --> 44:34.824
<i>Even Izaak Walton talks
about the goodness...</i>

44:34.958 --> 44:36.359
<i>of the God of nature.</i>

44:36.493 --> 44:38.894
<i>I've never seen Him, and
I've fished in ten states.</i>

44:39.028 --> 44:41.296
<i>Whoever, whatever,
wherever He is or isn't...</i>

44:41.431 --> 44:43.098
<i>if He really wants me
to notice Him...</i>

44:43.232 --> 44:45.399
<i>maybe He should stop
being so scarce.</i>

44:45.534 --> 44:49.136
<i>All right. Why can't a
duffer like me catch a fish?</i>

44:50.372 --> 44:52.105
<i>Isn't the answer obvious?</i>

44:52.239 --> 44:54.741
<i>Isn't it because at my
present level of skill...</i>

44:54.875 --> 44:57.410
<i>the fish would have to be
so damn dumb...</i>

44:57.545 --> 45:00.212
<i>and utterly unelusive
as to be not worth catching?</i>

45:00.346 --> 45:01.980
<i>And how much more elusive...</i>

45:02.115 --> 45:04.649
<i>should a thing as wondrous
as a soul be?</i>

45:04.783 --> 45:08.252
<i>Fishermen should be the
easiest of men to convince...</i>

45:08.387 --> 45:11.822
<i>to search for their souls,
because fishing is nothing but...</i>

45:11.956 --> 45:13.523
<i>the pursuit
of the elusive.</i>

45:13.658 --> 45:17.493
<i>How can you be so patient
in searching for fish...</i>

45:17.627 --> 45:20.096
<i>and so hasty
to write off your soul...</i>

45:20.230 --> 45:22.565
<i>because you can't see it?</i>

46:43.167 --> 46:45.201
<i>Hi.</i>

46:45.335 --> 46:48.204
<i>Yeah. Um...</i>

46:48.337 --> 46:51.139
<i>I was looking
for a girl named Eddy...</i>

46:51.274 --> 46:52.741
<i>who works for you.</i>

46:52.875 --> 46:55.910
<i>She- She worked
at your casting pool...</i>

46:56.044 --> 47:00.848
<i>at that angling fair
a couple of months ago?</i>

47:00.982 --> 47:02.916
<i>She got a new job?</i>

47:03.050 --> 47:05.018
<i>Okay. Well,
could you maybe tell me...</i>

47:05.152 --> 47:07.153
<i>you know,
where she's working now?</i>

47:07.288 --> 47:11.123
<i>No, because
of privacy issues. Right.</i>

47:14.060 --> 47:18.462
<i>Well, is there a supervisor that
I could talk to or something?</i>

47:43.518 --> 47:46.253
<i>You must be the only
living thing left in here.</i>

47:57.330 --> 48:00.331
<i>I'm thinking about an
ant. That sound good?</i>

49:41.584 --> 49:44.919
<i>Do you think the soul strikes
harder early in the morning...</i>

49:45.054 --> 49:46.254
<i>and late
in the evening...</i>

49:46.388 --> 49:47.388
<i>kind of like fish?</i>

49:47.523 --> 49:49.691
<i>Could be.</i>

49:49.825 --> 49:51.325
<i>Okay. So how
do you suppose...</i>

49:51.459 --> 49:52.759
<i>I ought to fish
for mine?</i>

49:52.894 --> 49:55.395
<i>With a soul pole,
I suppose.</i>

49:55.530 --> 49:57.396
<i>Where do
I get one?</i>

49:57.531 --> 49:59.231
<i>Right here's good.</i>

49:59.366 --> 50:00.633
<i>This where you
got yours?</i>

50:00.767 --> 50:01.734
<i>I got mine here.</i>

50:01.868 --> 50:05.337
<i>You got yours
in there.</i>

50:11.476 --> 50:14.645
<i>I still can't figure out
where this soul pole is.</i>

50:14.779 --> 50:15.813
<i>Shall I show you?</i>

50:15.947 --> 50:16.679
<i>Can you?</i>

50:16.814 --> 50:18.181
<i>I can by analogy.</i>

50:18.315 --> 50:20.683
<i>But you'll have to answer
a few questions first.</i>

50:20.818 --> 50:22.185
<i>Fire away.</i>

50:22.319 --> 50:23.952
<i>All right.</i>

50:24.087 --> 50:27.889
<i>Where is Rodney,
your trusty fishing rod...</i>

50:28.024 --> 50:29.024
<i>right now?</i>

50:29.158 --> 50:30.524
<i>At this moment...</i>

50:30.659 --> 50:33.227
<i>he is hanging
on my cabin wall.</i>

50:33.362 --> 50:34.795
<i>Who made Rodney...</i>

50:34.930 --> 50:36.563
<i>from an
indistinguishable blank...</i>

50:36.697 --> 50:39.366
<i>into the singing rod
he is today?</i>

50:39.500 --> 50:40.700
<i>I did.</i>

50:40.835 --> 50:43.001
<i>Yes. And who controls
his destiny?</i>

50:43.136 --> 50:44.770
<i>Decides when he'll
hang on the wall...</i>

50:44.904 --> 50:46.605
<i>or ride in the back
of the pickup truck...</i>

50:46.740 --> 50:47.973
<i>or cast for trout?</i>

50:48.108 --> 50:51.008
<i>And who will, one day,
decide he's worn out...</i>

50:51.143 --> 50:53.411
<i>and consign him
to a funeral pyre?</i>

50:53.545 --> 50:54.412
<i>I will.</i>

50:54.546 --> 50:55.579
<i>Excellent.</i>

50:55.713 --> 50:58.448
<i>Can you get me
a couple of cues?</i>

50:58.583 --> 50:59.716
<i>Yeah. Two of them.</i>

50:59.851 --> 51:02.752
<i>Now, who
do you suppose...</i>

51:02.886 --> 51:05.888
<i>created you...</i>

51:06.022 --> 51:08.323
<i>into the living fisherman
you are today?</i>

51:08.457 --> 51:09.457
<i>I wish I knew.</i>

51:09.592 --> 51:10.592
<i>Excellent!</i>

51:10.726 --> 51:12.160
<i>And who controls
your destiny?</i>

51:12.294 --> 51:13.695
<i>Wish I knew that, too.</i>

51:13.829 --> 51:16.630
<i>Very good. And who will,
one day...</i>

51:16.765 --> 51:19.066
<i>consign your body
to a wormy grave?</i>

51:19.200 --> 51:20.334
<i>I wish I knew that, too.</i>

51:20.468 --> 51:21.334
<i>Perfect!</i>

51:21.468 --> 51:22.635
<i>Why is that perfect?</i>

51:22.770 --> 51:25.338
<i>All I'm saying is,
"Oh, I wish I knew. "</i>

51:25.472 --> 51:27.739
<i>Come on. Don't you
want me to say...</i>

51:27.874 --> 51:30.142
<i>"God does it," or,
"My soul does it"-</i>

51:30.276 --> 51:34.079
<i>Gus, I'm a philosopher.
I'm not an evangelist.</i>

51:34.212 --> 51:37.815
<i>It's the "I wish I knew"
that is crucial.</i>

51:37.949 --> 51:40.784
<i>I mean, to say, "God did it,"
and then just leave it at that?</i>

51:40.918 --> 51:43.953
<i>That's to abandon the search
before it's even begun.</i>

51:44.088 --> 51:46.756
<i>Believe me, no one's ever
discovered any truth...</i>

51:46.891 --> 51:51.393
<i>by barfing up Sunday school
answers to questions.</i>

51:51.528 --> 51:54.028
<i>Now, you and I agreed,
did we not...</i>

51:54.163 --> 51:56.464
<i>that Rodney is oblivious...</i>

51:56.598 --> 51:59.033
<i>to everything save
some weight and varnish.</i>

51:59.168 --> 52:00.267
<i>We did.</i>

52:00.401 --> 52:02.736
<i>Therefore, does it follow...</i>

52:02.870 --> 52:05.338
<i>that he is
just as oblivious...</i>

52:05.473 --> 52:07.139
<i>to Gus?</i>

52:07.274 --> 52:09.275
<i>Even though Gus
is his maker?</i>

52:09.409 --> 52:12.545
<i>Even though Gus
controls his destiny?</i>

52:12.679 --> 52:14.078
<i>Even though Gus is-</i>

52:14.213 --> 52:17.682
<i>Let's go ahead and call it.
Gus is his essence.</i>

52:17.817 --> 52:18.817
<i>Yes, it follows.</i>

52:18.951 --> 52:21.518
<i>Then therefore,
is it possible...</i>

52:21.653 --> 52:23.487
<i>that maybe you and I...</i>

52:23.621 --> 52:24.788
<i>are just as oblivious...</i>

52:24.923 --> 52:26.389
<i>to the presence
of a Creator?</i>

52:26.523 --> 52:29.826
<i>Just as oblivious to a
controller of destiny?</i>

52:29.960 --> 52:32.727
<i>Just as oblivious
to our essence?</i>

52:32.862 --> 52:36.064
<i>An essence that wields you
and I even more deftly...</i>

52:36.199 --> 52:37.332
<i>than you wield Rodney.</i>

52:37.467 --> 52:40.868
<i>Sure, it's possible.</i>

52:41.002 --> 52:42.136
<i>Well, there you have it.</i>

52:42.270 --> 52:44.171
<i>Rodney is to Gus...</i>

52:44.306 --> 52:46.606
<i>as Gus is
to his essence.</i>

52:46.740 --> 52:49.075
<i>You name the essence soul
and you, sir...</i>

52:49.210 --> 52:50.743
<i>have your soul pole.</i>

52:50.878 --> 52:53.445
<i>Me?</i>

52:53.580 --> 52:56.381
<i>So, no matter how
hopelessly stupid I am...</i>

52:56.516 --> 53:01.419
<i>in comparison to my essence
or my soul...</i>

53:01.553 --> 53:05.589
<i>I still have
a profound purpose.</i>

53:05.723 --> 53:07.991
<i>I like that, Titus.</i>

53:08.125 --> 53:09.559
<i>I like that.</i>

53:09.694 --> 53:10.927
<i>Thank you.</i>

53:11.062 --> 53:14.730
<i>I swiped it
from Plotinus.</i>

53:16.399 --> 53:19.133
<i>¶¶Wait till I wake up ¶¶</i>

53:19.268 --> 53:22.337
<i>¶¶Wish something
could interrupt ¶¶</i>

53:22.471 --> 53:27.875
<i>¶¶The dream for much too long
I've lingered in ¶¶</i>

54:12.980 --> 54:13.914
<i>Hold on!</i>

54:14.048 --> 54:15.815
<i>Hang onto it. Easy.</i>

54:15.950 --> 54:19.652
<i>Easy. Don't force it,
don't force it.</i>

54:19.786 --> 54:21.220
<i>Easy. Easy.</i>

54:26.525 --> 54:29.893
<i>That's a real nice
jack salmon, son.</i>

54:30.028 --> 54:33.297
<i>It's not a jack.
It's a sea-run cutthroat.</i>

54:33.431 --> 54:35.265
<i>Oh.</i>

54:50.779 --> 54:51.845
<i>What are you doing?</i>

54:51.980 --> 54:54.281
<i>I'm getting skunked,
God damn it.</i>

54:54.416 --> 54:56.182
<i>I've been fishing all day...</i>

54:56.317 --> 54:59.752
<i>and I haven't
even gotten a bounce.</i>

54:59.887 --> 55:01.521
<i>I'm plum jinxed.</i>

55:01.655 --> 55:02.788
<i>Or plum dumb.</i>

55:02.922 --> 55:04.089
<i>What's that?</i>

55:04.223 --> 55:07.125
<i>Uh, done.</i>

55:10.295 --> 55:12.063
<i>I got here early
in the morning...</i>

55:12.197 --> 55:13.898
<i>nary a strike.</i>

55:14.032 --> 55:16.366
<i>You come here,
in ten seconds...</i>

55:16.500 --> 55:18.335
<i>zabba dabba doo.</i>

55:18.469 --> 55:21.271
<i>You land a nice jack.</i>

55:33.882 --> 55:35.282
<i>So, you...</i>

55:35.416 --> 55:39.987
<i>know any good tales about
this grand sport of ours?</i>

55:40.121 --> 55:41.187
<i>Yeah.</i>

55:41.321 --> 55:43.489
<i>So, what do you know?</i>

55:43.624 --> 55:45.157
<i>If you want to catch
a blueback...</i>

55:45.292 --> 55:46.192
<i>you're gonna need
some lighter gear.</i>

55:46.326 --> 55:48.493
<i>You have any with you?</i>

55:51.697 --> 55:56.000
<i>I guess, uh...</i>

55:56.134 --> 55:57.501
<i>I guess we can both
use my rod.</i>

55:57.636 --> 55:58.769
<i>Ah, now you're talking.</i>

56:00.038 --> 56:01.938
<i>Oh! God dammit!</i>

56:02.072 --> 56:03.940
<i>I am sorry.
I am sorry.</i>

56:04.074 --> 56:05.642
<i>It's okay, it's fine.
It's fine.</i>

56:05.776 --> 56:09.211
<i>Just- How about you
just stay up here...</i>

56:09.345 --> 56:13.781
<i>and hold on to that. I'm gonna,
you know, make us something up.</i>

56:13.915 --> 56:15.549
<i>Okay.</i>

56:24.692 --> 56:26.626
<i>Get yourself-</i>

56:26.760 --> 56:29.294
<i>Get yourself a little
nightcrawler there.</i>

56:29.429 --> 56:30.729
<i>Some clay.
Right there.</i>

56:30.864 --> 56:32.665
<i>Just roll it up
like that...</i>

56:32.799 --> 56:33.765
<i>and smooth it out.</i>

56:33.899 --> 56:35.767
<i>What's that
invention called?</i>

56:35.901 --> 56:40.470
<i>A Hostess Twinkie.</i>

56:40.605 --> 56:42.039
<i>And get ready.</i>

56:55.518 --> 56:57.952
<i>I got one!
I got it. I got it.</i>

56:59.421 --> 57:00.688
<i>Yeah. Don't
lose it.</i>

57:00.822 --> 57:02.623
<i>I got it!
I got it.</i>

57:02.757 --> 57:04.625
<i>Come on.</i>

57:06.593 --> 57:07.560
<i>You got him.</i>

57:07.695 --> 57:08.795
<i>Look at that.</i>

57:10.998 --> 57:11.998
<i>Nice.</i>

57:12.131 --> 57:14.933
<i>Oh. Oh.</i>

57:15.068 --> 57:17.069
<i>What do you say, 18 inches?</i>

57:17.203 --> 57:20.604
<i>Oh, you can tell people that's 24.</i>

57:20.739 --> 57:23.207
<i>Love it.</i>

57:23.341 --> 57:24.942
<i>Hey, I gotta
rush back to town...</i>

57:25.077 --> 57:27.143
<i>and write this up
for tomorrow's paper.</i>

57:27.278 --> 57:29.512
<i>For tomorrow's what?</i>

57:29.647 --> 57:31.014
<i>Post Telegram.</i>

57:31.148 --> 57:32.948
<i>Dutch Hines.</i>

57:33.083 --> 57:34.416
<i>The F-F-Fishing Dutchman.</i>

57:34.551 --> 57:35.517
<i>You're Dutch Hines.</i>

57:35.652 --> 57:37.553
<i>Yeah. What's your name?</i>

57:37.687 --> 57:39.454
<i>I'm just Gus.</i>

57:39.588 --> 57:41.556
<i>But that's really
just a nickname.</i>

57:41.690 --> 57:44.459
<i>So I wouldn't- I would-
I wouldn't use that.</i>

57:44.593 --> 57:47.994
<i>You know, I'd like
to interview you, Gus.</i>

57:48.129 --> 57:50.797
<i>Haven't had
a better day's f-f-fishing...</i>

57:50.932 --> 57:54.900
<i>since I lost nine steelhead
one morning on the Kilchis...</i>

57:55.035 --> 57:58.470
<i>two winters ago. I was
fishing with Fuzz Gramsay.</i>

57:58.604 --> 58:01.539
<i>Yeah, I
- I remember that trip. You wrote about it 12 times.</i>

58:01.674 --> 58:06.043
<i>Yeah! So, you wanna do
an interview?</i>

58:06.177 --> 58:09.847
<i>Um, c-c-</i>

58:09.981 --> 58:12.081
<i>Can I have one second?</i>

58:12.216 --> 58:14.417
<i>Sure.</i>

58:19.756 --> 58:21.556
<i>Dutch Hines wants
to interview me.</i>

58:21.691 --> 58:24.358
<i>That idiot's got three-quarter
of a million readers.</i>

58:24.493 --> 58:27.895
<i>He can write about me for
weeks and not be distracted.</i>

58:28.029 --> 58:30.130
<i>Nothing's gonna distract
him for months...</i>

58:30.264 --> 58:32.999
<i>'cause he's not gonna
catch a fish for months.</i>

58:33.134 --> 58:36.002
<i>He made Fuzz Gramsay rich
by endorsing him.</i>

58:36.137 --> 58:40.606
<i>He endorses me...</i>

58:40.740 --> 58:43.708
<i>and I'll have a thousand
polers by the end of the month.</i>

58:48.781 --> 58:51.448
<i>Well, what do you say? You
want to do an interview?</i>

58:51.582 --> 58:53.984
<i>Listen to this, Caroline.</i>

58:54.118 --> 58:58.521
<i>"By a stroke of dumb luck, this old
dog learned a bag full of tricks...</i>

58:58.655 --> 59:00.856
<i>"from a young buck

59:00.991 --> 59:03.191
<i>"who just might be...</i>

59:03.325 --> 59:06.694
<i>"the finest fisherman
this great Northwest of ours...</i>

59:06.829 --> 59:09.063
<i>has seen
in many a decade. "</i>

59:14.636 --> 59:19.772
<i>"His friends call him Gus. "</i>

59:19.907 --> 59:22.574
<i>"But he told us this
is just a nickname. "</i>

59:22.708 --> 59:26.978
<i>Okay. My real name
is Antoine Chapeau.</i>

59:27.113 --> 59:32.183
<i>I'm originally from Palm
Springs, California...</i>

59:32.317 --> 59:33.984
<i>where I used
to manage a-</i>

59:34.119 --> 59:37.053
<i>a beauty salon.</i>

59:37.188 --> 59:38.621
<i>And I would spend
my whole day...</i>

59:38.756 --> 59:42.658
<i>just looking
at women's hair.</i>

59:42.792 --> 59:43.725
<i>But you know
what, Dutch?</i>

59:43.860 --> 59:45.127
<i>I thought
I was going crazy...</i>

59:45.261 --> 59:47.095
<i>because I'd be looking
at a woman's hair...</i>

59:47.230 --> 59:50.531
<i>and I'd be imagining
five-pound tippets.</i>

59:50.666 --> 59:53.935
<i>Or algae or something. Three-pound
leaders. It doesn't matter.</i>

59:54.069 --> 59:58.104
<i>Everything reminded me
of-of the river.</i>

59:58.239 --> 59:59.739
<i>So finally I said,
you know what?</i>

59:59.874 --> 01:00:02.808
<i>Antoine, this
can't be healthy.</i>

01:00:02.943 --> 01:00:05.044
<i>So I pulled up the stakes.
I moved to Oregon...</i>

01:00:05.178 --> 01:00:07.079
<i>and I just
started fishing.</i>

01:00:07.214 --> 01:00:09.280
<i>All day
every day, fishing.</i>

01:00:09.415 --> 01:00:12.217
<i>"And fish he does, with
a passion and skill...</i>

01:00:12.351 --> 01:00:14.284
<i>"he claimed he acquired
using a fly rod...</i>

01:00:14.419 --> 01:00:16.920
<i>"out in the deserts
around Palm Springs.</i>

01:00:17.055 --> 01:00:19.623
<i>"This dry fishing, as he
calls it, is what taught him...</i>

01:00:19.757 --> 01:00:23.526
<i>"both the incredible patience
and the shamanistic approach...</i>

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:26.429
<i>to the sport
that characterizes him today. "</i>

01:00:26.563 --> 01:00:28.964
<i>Listen, I gotta get
back to the paper. Uh...</i>

01:00:29.098 --> 01:00:30.899
<i>what do you say we
meet again next week...</i>

01:00:31.033 --> 01:00:32.701
<i>and you tell me
some more?</i>

01:00:32.835 --> 01:00:37.338
<i>Okay. But only if you put a
message in the paper for me.</i>

01:00:37.472 --> 01:00:39.006
<i>"Will the girl who ran
from the guy...</i>

01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:41.140

<i>"please contact Gus on

<i>"He has your pole

<i>"He's totally harmless

01:00:50.917 --> 01:00:52.818
<i>"to bring
a loaded gun if scared.</i>

01:00:52.952 --> 01:00:55.720
<i>As long as you come.
Thank you. "</i>

01:01:16.272 --> 01:01:17.972
<i>Gus!</i>

01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:19.373
<i>We want to go fishing.</i>

01:01:19.507 --> 01:01:21.241
<i>It's time
for another lesson.</i>

01:01:21.376 --> 01:01:23.076
<i>Hey, guys. Can we
do it another time?</i>

01:01:23.211 --> 01:01:25.212
<i>I just- I just don't
really feel like it.</i>

01:01:25.346 --> 01:01:28.247
<i>Fishing. Fishing. Fishing.</i>

01:01:28.382 --> 01:01:31.083
<i>Let's go fishing.</i>

01:01:31.218 --> 01:01:32.884
<i>Let's go.</i>

01:01:33.019 --> 01:01:34.452
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:01:49.867 --> 01:01:50.900
<i>Very nice.</i>

01:01:56.839 --> 01:01:57.806
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

01:01:57.941 --> 01:01:58.873
<i>Gimme.</i>

01:01:59.007 --> 01:01:59.707
<i>Stop. It's snagged.</i>

01:01:59.741 --> 01:02:00.741
<i>Gimme.</i>

01:02:00.876 --> 01:02:01.809
<i>What?</i>

01:02:01.944 --> 01:02:03.577
<i>It's snagged. See?</i>

01:02:03.712 --> 01:02:04.611
<i>Oh, man.</i>

01:02:04.745 --> 01:02:06.146
<i>Whoa,
whoa, hey!</i>

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.681
<i>Hemingway,
come here.</i>

01:02:07.815 --> 01:02:08.815
<i>Come here. Hey!</i>

01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:10.717
<i>Do you wanna
catch this fish?</i>

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.167
<i>Just get right here.
That's the spot, okay?</i>

01:02:31.301 --> 01:02:34.537
<i>Just head west. Just
head west, all right?</i>

01:02:34.671 --> 01:02:37.472
<i>There you go.
Good luck.</i>

01:02:37.606 --> 01:02:40.241
<i>How's it going?</i>

01:02:40.376 --> 01:02:42.610
<i>Yeah, I fish out here
everyday with 'em.</i>

01:02:42.745 --> 01:02:43.844
<i>Those are good.</i>

01:02:50.784 --> 01:02:51.784
<i>Good luck.</i>

01:02:51.919 --> 01:02:53.186
<i>How's it going?</i>

01:02:55.889 --> 01:02:56.989
<i>Uh,</i>

01:02:59.759 --> 01:03:02.294
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:03:02.428 --> 01:03:04.161
<i>Uh.</i>

01:03:04.296 --> 01:03:06.330
<i>Good luck.</i>

01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:55.722
<i>See, I read that I should bring
a loaded gun with me, so...</i>

01:04:55.857 --> 01:04:58.826
<i>I took your advice
to the letter.</i>

01:05:00.828 --> 01:05:03.162
<i>I believe you have my pole.</i>

01:05:05.265 --> 01:05:06.731
<i>Right.</i>

01:05:21.212 --> 01:05:23.079
<i>And a fish.</i>

01:05:37.192 --> 01:05:40.127
<i>Wait, wait, wait. I
- I get the pole and the fish, but...</i>

01:05:42.864 --> 01:05:44.598
<i>what's this?</i>

01:05:44.732 --> 01:05:48.434
<i>The belly reel that goes with the
- the pole.</i>

01:05:53.706 --> 01:05:56.040
<i>And how'd you know
I'd come for them?</i>

01:05:56.175 --> 01:05:58.042
<i>I didn't.</i>

01:06:00.145 --> 01:06:03.580
<i>Everything in the world
made me think you wouldn't.</i>

01:06:11.754 --> 01:06:14.723
<i>There is something
I should tell you.</i>

01:06:14.857 --> 01:06:18.926
<i>About that day.</i>

01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:21.395
<i>I never ran.</i>

01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:23.864
<i>Huh?</i>

01:06:23.999 --> 01:06:26.799
<i>I never ran away.</i>

01:06:26.934 --> 01:06:30.036
<i>I was barefoot.
So I...</i>

01:06:30.171 --> 01:06:31.870
<i>hid in the woods and...</i>

01:06:32.005 --> 01:06:34.406
<i>I saw you climb
above that pole...</i>

01:06:34.541 --> 01:06:36.408
<i>where I hooked
the steelhead.</i>

01:06:39.278 --> 01:06:42.580
<i>And then,
I stepped on an orange...</i>

01:06:44.749 --> 01:06:45.782
<i>and this.</i>

01:06:49.921 --> 01:06:52.788
<i>See, when you came
crashing along...</i>

01:06:52.923 --> 01:06:55.057
<i>you came from upstream.</i>

01:06:55.192 --> 01:06:55.991
<i>Uh-</i>

01:06:56.126 --> 01:06:57.358
<i>And the orange-</i>

01:06:57.493 --> 01:07:01.162
<i>Huh? And the orange
and this, this telescope...</i>

01:07:01.297 --> 01:07:04.298
<i>this telescope
were downstream.</i>

01:07:04.432 --> 01:07:05.999
<i>Now, I mean, come on.
It doesn't take</i>

01:07:06.134 --> 01:07:07.467
<i>Sherlock freakin' Holmes-</i>

01:07:07.602 --> 01:07:08.502
<i>Okay.</i>

01:07:08.636 --> 01:07:09.636
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

01:07:09.771 --> 01:07:11.470
<i>Just listen to me
for a second.</i>

01:07:11.605 --> 01:07:13.005
<i>Spying on me.
While I was-</i>

01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:14.340
<i>Okay, wait,
hu- Hold- No-</i>

01:07:14.474 --> 01:07:15.641
<i>While I was-</i>

01:07:15.776 --> 01:07:19.611
<i>Hold on.
Just give me a second.</i>

01:07:19.745 --> 01:07:23.547
<i>Okay, I admit
that is my telescope.</i>

01:07:23.682 --> 01:07:29.552
<i>And I'm s-sorry that I
was spying on you, but...</i>

01:07:29.687 --> 01:07:31.688
<i>really, I was just
wandering around...</i>

01:07:31.822 --> 01:07:34.557
<i>looking for a place
to swim and then...</i>

01:07:36.726 --> 01:07:37.793
<i>there was you.</i>

01:07:41.130 --> 01:07:42.964
<i>This beautiful girl.</i>

01:07:43.098 --> 01:07:44.198
<i>And you were fishing.</i>

01:07:44.333 --> 01:07:45.700
<i>And the "here
goes nothing" way...</i>

01:07:45.834 --> 01:07:47.401
<i>you chucked
that hazel pole...</i>

01:07:47.536 --> 01:07:50.403
<i>into the water, and the way you
dove in and swam after it, I-</i>

01:07:50.538 --> 01:07:53.607
<i>I just knew that you had some
way of looking at things...</i>

01:07:53.741 --> 01:07:55.708
<i>some way of looking at life
and the world...</i>

01:07:55.842 --> 01:07:57.676
<i>which is exactly the way
of looking at things...</i>

01:07:57.811 --> 01:07:59.545
<i>that I've been trying
to look at things.</i>

01:07:59.679 --> 01:08:01.347
<i>I n my whole life,
I've only met two people...</i>

01:08:01.481 --> 01:08:03.414
<i>who have ever
looked at things...</i>

01:08:03.549 --> 01:08:06.017
<i>any way close to that way.</i>

01:08:06.151 --> 01:08:07.285
<i>My little brother...</i>

01:08:07.419 --> 01:08:09.052
<i>and a philosopher
who talks to his dog.</i>

01:08:09.187 --> 01:08:12.489
<i>And with both of them it
was love at first sight, too.</i>

01:08:18.795 --> 01:08:20.595
<i>But I'm not sorry.</i>

01:08:23.432 --> 01:08:24.666
<i>When you see
the most amazing...</i>

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.067
<i>beautiful thing
you've ever seen...</i>

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:28.769
<i>you don't think about
what's right or polite...</i>

01:08:28.903 --> 01:08:31.604
<i>or tell it to cover up.</i>

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:34.207
<i>Because you can't
stop looking.</i>

01:08:34.341 --> 01:08:35.707
<i>You s-</i>

01:08:35.843 --> 01:08:37.910
<i>You're just helpless.</i>

01:08:53.591 --> 01:08:54.890
<i>What's so funny?</i>

01:08:55.026 --> 01:08:57.127
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:08:59.729 --> 01:09:01.397
<i>You.</i>

01:09:01.531 --> 01:09:03.599
<i>I n a tree.</i>

01:09:03.733 --> 01:09:06.902
<i>Spouting off stuff like...</i>

01:09:07.036 --> 01:09:09.370
<i>"Oh, good scholar"</i>

01:09:09.505 --> 01:09:12.939
<i>and that "God never made...</i>

01:09:13.075 --> 01:09:16.542
<i>"a more pure,
innocent recreation...</i>

01:09:16.678 --> 01:09:18.912
<i>than angling. "</i>

01:09:24.117 --> 01:09:26.285
<i>I like that, Gus.</i>

01:09:29.721 --> 01:09:32.424
<i>Can I ask you
a question?</i>

01:09:32.558 --> 01:09:34.091
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:09:34.225 --> 01:09:37.627
<i>What are you
doing here?</i>

01:09:37.761 --> 01:09:38.929
<i>This is my cabin.</i>

01:09:39.064 --> 01:09:40.830
<i>Shouldn't I be
asking you that?</i>

01:09:40.964 --> 01:09:43.299
<i>No.</i>

01:09:43.434 --> 01:09:46.734
<i>Not here, here.
I mean-</i>

01:09:46.868 --> 01:09:49.004
<i>Here!</i>

01:09:49.138 --> 01:09:51.340
<i>Here.</i>

01:09:51.474 --> 01:09:53.741
<i>Alone.</i>

01:10:02.316 --> 01:10:04.684
<i>Fishing.</i>

01:10:06.686 --> 01:10:08.654
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

01:10:11.991 --> 01:10:13.925
<i>Here here?</i>

01:10:15.761 --> 01:10:17.528
<i>Here here.</i>

01:10:22.233 --> 01:10:24.935
<i>Fishing.</i>

01:10:27.804 --> 01:10:29.672
<i>You know, I saw you
in Portland.</i>

01:10:29.806 --> 01:10:33.475
<i>You did?
Where?</i>

01:10:33.609 --> 01:10:37.512
<i>I saw you rescue that trout
from that filthy creek.</i>

01:10:37.646 --> 01:10:40.781
<i>I guess you could
say it made me...</i>

01:10:40.915 --> 01:10:43.384
<i>curious.</i>

01:10:45.319 --> 01:10:46.252
<i>So, I drove
up here...</i>

01:10:46.387 --> 01:10:49.222
<i>to see
what I could see.</i>

01:10:49.356 --> 01:10:51.256
<i>And I ran
into this little boy...</i>

01:10:51.391 --> 01:10:55.694
<i>who called
himself Hemingway.</i>

01:10:55.828 --> 01:10:56.962
<i>And he
immediately...</i>

01:10:57.096 --> 01:10:58.896
<i>launched into this
epic tale...</i>

01:10:59.030 --> 01:11:02.700
<i>about a giant fish that
he caught with help...</i>

01:11:02.834 --> 01:11:07.704
<i>from a certain
superhero named Gus.</i>

01:11:07.838 --> 01:11:10.340
<i>Who spent seven
minutes under water</i>

01:11:10.474 --> 01:11:13.242
<i>before he wrassled the
fish with his bare hands.</i>

01:11:13.376 --> 01:11:14.410
<i>Bullshit.</i>

01:11:14.544 --> 01:11:15.444
<i>I know.</i>

01:11:15.578 --> 01:11:18.579
<i>That's what
I figured.</i>

01:11:18.714 --> 01:11:21.449
<i>But I could see
in his eyes...</i>

01:11:21.583 --> 01:11:25.218
<i>what little Hemingway
thought of you...</i>

01:11:25.353 --> 01:11:29.189
<i>and it made me
even more curious.</i>

01:11:36.495 --> 01:11:37.695
<i>You know,
I must have read...</i>

01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:39.898
<i>that Fishing
Dutchman's article...</i>

01:11:40.032 --> 01:11:42.801
<i>like, 8000 times.</i>

01:11:42.935 --> 01:11:45.135
<i>I knew
it was you.</i>

01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:48.439
<i>And this time
I came to see you.</i>

01:11:51.675 --> 01:11:54.577
<i>And you know
what happened next?</i>

01:11:54.711 --> 01:11:58.213
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:11:58.347 --> 01:12:00.749
<i>You do?</i>

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:02.950
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:12:30.641 --> 01:12:34.778
<i>You threw his prize fish in the fire?</i>

01:12:34.912 --> 01:12:36.579
<i>It wasn't
just any fish.</i>

01:12:36.713 --> 01:12:38.814
<i>He was Nijinsky.</i>

01:12:43.152 --> 01:12:45.253
<i>That went over real well, I'm sure.</i>

01:12:45.387 --> 01:12:48.589
<i>Uh, not really.</i>

01:12:48.723 --> 01:12:51.692
<i>I haven't even spoken
to either of them since.</i>

01:12:51.826 --> 01:12:56.128
<i>I don't even know why I came out here.</i>

01:12:56.263 --> 01:12:58.698
<i>Guess I just needed to get away.</i>

01:12:58.832 --> 01:13:01.633
<i>Your parents seem like
an interesting match.</i>

01:13:01.767 --> 01:13:05.370
<i>I nteresting is a kind word for it.</i>

01:13:23.786 --> 01:13:27.655
<i>Bravo, Nijinsky.</i>

01:13:27.789 --> 01:13:29.390
<i>There are two stories...</i>

01:13:29.525 --> 01:13:30.925
<i>of how Nijinsky
found his way...</i>

01:13:31.059 --> 01:13:32.860
<i>onto my parents' mantle.</i>

01:13:32.995 --> 01:13:36.429
<i>The one that landed
my father his book deal.</i>

01:13:36.564 --> 01:13:38.498
<i>And the one
that's the truth.</i>

01:13:38.633 --> 01:13:40.966
<i>Both versions begin
the same way.</i>

01:13:41.101 --> 01:13:42.401
<i>With an epic struggle...</i>

01:13:42.536 --> 01:13:44.637
<i>between a determined
young fly fisherman...</i>

01:13:44.771 --> 01:13:46.838
<i>and a giant steelhead.</i>

01:13:46.972 --> 01:13:48.406
<i>Little did
either of them realize...</i>

01:13:48.541 --> 01:13:49.974
<i>that their true nemesis...</i>

01:13:50.109 --> 01:13:52.677
<i>was lurking somewhere
down river.</i>

01:14:45.488 --> 01:14:48.090
<i>It was my father's
worst nightmare.</i>

01:14:48.224 --> 01:14:49.425
<i>A mere plunker of worms...</i>

01:14:49.559 --> 01:14:51.659
<i>had cost him
his prized Nijinsky.</i>

01:14:51.794 --> 01:14:53.561
<i>Whoever this crude
interloper was...</i>

01:14:53.696 --> 01:14:54.829
<i>he would have
to be dealt with.</i>

01:14:54.964 --> 01:14:55.863
<i>You-</i>

01:14:55.998 --> 01:14:57.231
<i>Man to man.</i>

01:14:57.366 --> 01:14:59.533
<i>had best refrain from that pole
and defend yourself.</i>

01:14:59.667 --> 01:15:01.535
<i>Because one of us
is going in that river...</i>

01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:03.170
<i>in search
of my fish!</i>

01:15:03.304 --> 01:15:04.670
<i>So be it, slicker.</i>

01:15:04.805 --> 01:15:06.606
<i>But I
guaran-goddamn-tee ya...</i>

01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:08.307
<i>It ain't
gonna be me.</i>

01:15:10.711 --> 01:15:13.445
<i>Come on
and fight me!</i>

01:15:13.579 --> 01:15:16.147
<i>Come on and fight me! Come on.</i>

01:15:25.356 --> 01:15:27.223
<i>Oops.</i>

01:15:41.803 --> 01:15:43.870
<i>As my father
watched the woman...</i>

01:15:44.005 --> 01:15:45.805
<i>reel in Nijinsky
for herself...</i>

01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:47.407
<i>he had no idea...</i>

01:15:47.541 --> 01:15:49.743
<i>that she would become
his lifetime adversary.</i>

01:15:51.144 --> 01:15:52.845
<i>She would also
become my mom.</i>

01:16:10.827 --> 01:16:13.796
<i>Looks like you could
use a little warming up.</i>

01:16:18.401 --> 01:16:20.969
<i>My parents came
to an understanding.</i>

01:16:21.103 --> 01:16:25.105
<i>The story would be told as
maybe it should have been.</i>

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:26.840
<i>After all,
my father reasoned...</i>

01:16:26.975 --> 01:16:29.308
<i>she did cause his
six-pound tippet to snap...</i>

01:16:29.443 --> 01:16:32.712
<i>and he had spent all that
time tiring the fish out...</i>

01:16:32.846 --> 01:16:35.714
<i>making it easy for Ma
to just reel him in.</i>

01:16:40.687 --> 01:16:42.253
<i>So the deal was sealed.</i>

01:16:42.387 --> 01:16:44.021
<i>H20 would have his story.</i>

01:16:44.156 --> 01:16:45.456
<i>But never again...</i>

01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:47.725
<i>would they use anything
resembling reason...</i>

01:16:47.859 --> 01:16:50.794
<i>in their discussion
of the art of angling.</i>

01:16:50.928 --> 01:16:53.129
<i>Never again would they
go fishing together...</i>

01:16:53.264 --> 01:16:57.599
<i>and never would their
marriage vows waver or weaken.</i>

01:17:03.806 --> 01:17:06.474
<i>Darn it.</i>

01:17:10.278 --> 01:17:12.546
<i>Fly tying is for certain
a tedious task...</i>

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:16.916
<i>but there's no need to let it
get to you like that, my love.</i>

01:17:17.050 --> 01:17:21.786
<i>Yeah, well, it ain't the
fly that's bothering me.</i>

01:17:21.921 --> 01:17:24.089
<i>Hm. Gus.</i>

01:17:24.223 --> 01:17:25.990
<i>I just can't help
but feel...</i>

01:17:26.125 --> 01:17:29.426
<i>like we let him go.</i>

01:17:29.561 --> 01:17:30.761
<i>You can't keep a person...</i>

01:17:30.895 --> 01:17:33.897
<i>in a place he doesn't
want to be.</i>

01:17:34.031 --> 01:17:36.632
<i>No, but can't you at
least make it a place...</i>

01:17:36.767 --> 01:17:39.302
<i>that they might
wanna visit?</i>

01:18:14.866 --> 01:18:17.300
<i>Cripes.</i>

01:18:35.083 --> 01:18:38.385
<i>Give me
the other one.</i>

01:19:07.210 --> 01:19:09.411
<i>What's that?</i>

01:19:09.546 --> 01:19:14.115
<i>Um, it's
today's dreefee.</i>

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:17.485
<i>What'd you say?</i>

01:19:17.619 --> 01:19:19.619
<i>When you were a kid,
didn't you have...</i>

01:19:19.754 --> 01:19:21.421
<i>you know,
some stuffed animal...</i>

01:19:21.556 --> 01:19:23.123
<i>or a ratty blanket
or something...</i>

01:19:23.257 --> 01:19:24.456
<i>that you
just absolutely...</i>

01:19:24.591 --> 01:19:26.058
<i>could not go
to sleep without?</i>

01:19:27.627 --> 01:19:29.595
<i>I had
the grossest pillow...</i>

01:19:29.729 --> 01:19:31.296
<i>that I had
to take everywhere.</i>

01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:34.432
<i>Okay. Well,
Bill Bob has dreefees.</i>

01:19:34.567 --> 01:19:36.034
<i>Okay.</i>

01:19:38.303 --> 01:19:41.305
<i>A dreefee is a, um...</i>

01:19:41.439 --> 01:19:43.040
<i>it's a carefully
selected relic...</i>

01:19:43.174 --> 01:19:45.007
<i>of that
day's adventure.</i>

01:19:45.142 --> 01:19:47.410
<i>So there's a different one every night.</i>

01:19:47.544 --> 01:19:50.279
<i>And just as important
as the dreefee itself...</i>

01:19:50.413 --> 01:19:54.082
<i>is the placement
of the dreefee.</i>

01:19:54.217 --> 01:19:56.218
<i>And if that's altered
in any way...</i>

01:19:56.352 --> 01:19:57.818
<i>before Bill Bob
falls asleep...</i>

01:19:57.953 --> 01:20:01.188
<i>it has the same effect
of not having one at all.</i>

01:20:01.323 --> 01:20:04.390
<i>And he doesn't fuss, he
doesn't protest, he just-</i>

01:20:04.525 --> 01:20:07.260
<i>doesn't go to sleep.</i>

01:20:07.394 --> 01:20:08.628
<i>All night long.</i>

01:20:08.762 --> 01:20:09.729
<i>M m-hm.</i>

01:20:09.864 --> 01:20:11.196
<i>Wow.</i>

01:20:15.168 --> 01:20:17.168
<i>There was one time
that the dreefee was...</i>

01:20:17.302 --> 01:20:21.405
<i>a- it was
a dried-up dog turd.</i>

01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:23.840
<i>And it had just
- It had been bleached white...</i>

01:20:23.975 --> 01:20:27.077
<i>by, you know, the sun
and the elements, and...</i>

01:20:27.211 --> 01:20:31.180
<i>and it was shaped exactly like
a tiny sleeping polar bear.</i>

01:20:31.314 --> 01:20:34.583
<i>But Bill Bob said that it was
a tiny sleeping polar bear.</i>

01:20:34.718 --> 01:20:38.152
<i>And that it had been eaten by a dog
and then it had proved indigestible...</i>

01:20:38.287 --> 01:20:39.854
<i>and then it
had been eliminated...</i>

01:20:39.989 --> 01:20:41.823
<i>and due
to its unmentionable...</i>

01:20:41.957 --> 01:20:44.057
<i>experience in the dog,
it was in a coma.</i>

01:20:44.192 --> 01:20:48.095
<i>Bill Bob was going to invoke
the powers of the Tooth Fairy...</i>

01:20:48.229 --> 01:20:52.365
<i>to bring it
back to life.</i>

01:20:52.499 --> 01:20:56.601
<i>But Ma just threw the poor
polar bear out the window...</i>

01:20:56.736 --> 01:20:58.570
<i>without a question
or even a glance...</i>

01:20:58.704 --> 01:21:03.741
<i>at its miraculously
sculpted bearness.</i>

01:21:03.875 --> 01:21:07.444
<i>She didn't
believe his story.</i>

01:21:07.579 --> 01:21:10.613
<i>Guess not.</i>

01:21:10.748 --> 01:21:13.716
<i>And he didn't
sleep all night long?</i>

01:21:13.851 --> 01:21:15.984
<i>M m-mm.</i>

01:21:52.951 --> 01:21:53.916
<i>Here we go.</i>

01:21:54.051 --> 01:21:56.052
<i>Where are
we going?</i>

01:21:59.056 --> 01:22:03.525
<i>Well, I'm going
to Portland tonight...</i>

01:22:03.659 --> 01:22:06.561
<i>and you...</i>

01:22:06.696 --> 01:22:08.562
<i>you're staying here.</i>

01:22:08.697 --> 01:22:09.697
<i>Come on.</i>

01:22:09.831 --> 01:22:11.031
<i>Come on what?</i>

01:22:11.166 --> 01:22:15.201
<i>What's the lightest
leader you've got?</i>

01:22:15.336 --> 01:22:17.003
<i>Three pound.</i>

01:22:17.137 --> 01:22:19.739
<i>All right,
hand me the rod.</i>

01:22:19.873 --> 01:22:23.575
<i>Tie it up
and bait it.</i>

01:22:23.710 --> 01:22:25.277
<i>Come on.</i>

01:22:25.411 --> 01:22:26.978
<i>Will it...</i>

01:22:27.112 --> 01:22:29.380
<i>will it mess up
your plan if I ask...</i>

01:22:29.514 --> 01:22:32.249
<i>what exactly you're doing?</i>

01:22:33.918 --> 01:22:35.151
<i>I'm fishing.</i>

01:22:35.286 --> 01:22:36.252
<i>You do realize...</i>

01:22:36.387 --> 01:22:37.821
<i>there's nothing
but Chinook...</i>

01:22:37.955 --> 01:22:40.923
<i>in the water
right now, don't you?</i>

01:22:41.057 --> 01:22:41.957
<i>I know that.</i>

01:22:42.092 --> 01:22:44.226
<i>Those can weigh fifty pounds.</i>

01:22:44.361 --> 01:22:47.762
<i>I know.</i>

01:22:47.896 --> 01:22:49.330
<i>So...</i>

01:22:49.465 --> 01:22:51.032
<i>even if it
were possible...</i>

01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:54.267
<i>to hook a Chinook...</i>

01:22:54.402 --> 01:22:57.170
<i>on that leader
without breaking it</i>

01:22:57.305 --> 01:23:01.273
<i>you couldn't land him even
if you played him all night.</i>

01:23:04.945 --> 01:23:06.077
<i>I know that.</i>

01:23:06.212 --> 01:23:11.049
<i>But you have to leave
before dark.</i>

01:23:11.183 --> 01:23:13.117
<i>I do.</i>

01:23:13.251 --> 01:23:15.986
<i>But you don't, Gus.</i>

01:23:16.121 --> 01:23:18.155
<i>Got to follow through
with the plan.</i>

01:23:37.372 --> 01:23:39.706
<i>There. Come here, Gus.</i>

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:42.175
<i>Come here.</i>

01:23:42.309 --> 01:23:45.744
<i>Take the rod.</i>

01:23:45.879 --> 01:23:48.247
<i>Keep your
tip up.</i>

01:23:48.381 --> 01:23:49.715
<i>Don't fight it.</i>

01:23:54.453 --> 01:23:56.521
<i>Play the Chinook.</i>

01:23:56.655 --> 01:23:58.221
<i>What?</i>

01:26:35.122 --> 01:26:38.524
<i>You getting a little
tuckered out there?</i>

01:26:40.526 --> 01:26:42.894
<i>Me too.</i>

01:27:32.370 --> 01:27:34.004
<i>Aha.</i>

01:28:48.302 --> 01:28:49.602
<i>You heading home?</i>

01:28:52.605 --> 01:28:55.140
<i>I thought
you might be a girl.</i>

01:29:21.496 --> 01:29:23.396
<i>As we walked upriver...</i>

01:29:23.531 --> 01:29:25.832
<i>I felt like we were
on a primordial journey...</i>

01:29:25.966 --> 01:29:29.401
<i>to some forgotten,
ancient home.</i>

01:29:29.536 --> 01:29:32.838
<i>The fisherman in me
was being unmade.</i>

01:29:32.972 --> 01:29:34.540
<i>With so light a line...</i>

01:29:34.674 --> 01:29:36.140
<i>there could be no question...</i>

01:29:36.275 --> 01:29:39.243
<i>of ever bringing
this great fish to bay.</i>

01:29:39.378 --> 01:29:41.512
<i>So there would be
no betrayal.</i>

01:29:41.647 --> 01:29:44.748
<i>No struggle.
No sacrifice.</i>

01:29:44.882 --> 01:29:46.783
<i>No death.</i>

01:29:46.918 --> 01:29:48.384
<i>There was only
a Chinook...</i>

01:29:48.518 --> 01:29:49.985
<i>leading an undone fisherman...</i>

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:52.254
<i>deeper into the night.</i>

01:32:05.034 --> 01:32:07.635
<i>As I watched the sun
wake the valley...</i>

01:32:07.770 --> 01:32:11.972
<i>I felt as though an oldest,
greatest, longest-lost friend...</i>

01:32:12.106 --> 01:32:16.109
<i>had come to walk the road,
unseen, beside me.</i>

01:32:16.244 --> 01:32:18.144
<i>And just as quickly
that feeling left...</i>

01:32:18.278 --> 01:32:20.913
<i>and blended
with the sunlight.</i>

01:32:22.983 --> 01:32:25.817
<i>I knew from this point on
there was no escape...</i>

01:32:25.952 --> 01:32:28.720
<i>and nowhere to go.</i>

01:32:28.855 --> 01:32:31.222
<i>I was already there.</i>

01:33:44.418 --> 01:33:46.185
<i>¶¶When the bough broke ¶¶</i>

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:49.421
<i>¶¶We were crossing America ¶¶</i>

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:55.426
<i>¶¶You with your stories ¶¶</i>

01:33:55.561 --> 01:33:58.496
<i>¶¶And me hanging on ¶¶</i>

01:34:02.533 --> 01:34:04.134
<i>¶¶Hands on the wheel ¶¶</i>

01:34:04.268 --> 01:34:07.103
<i>¶¶Your hair out the window ¶¶</i>

01:34:11.007 --> 01:34:13.142
<i>¶¶Its counterfeit color ¶¶</i>

01:34:13.276 --> 01:34:16.611
<i>¶¶Danced
In the September air ¶¶</i>

01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:21.648
<i>¶¶When the bough broke ¶¶</i>

01:34:21.783 --> 01:34:26.153
<i>¶¶We were flirting
With Canada ¶¶</i>

01:34:28.822 --> 01:34:31.257
<i>¶¶You said prove
that you love me ¶¶</i>

01:34:31.391 --> 01:34:33.726
<i>¶¶And live with me there ¶¶</i>

01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:36.161
<i>Today's dreefee.</i>

01:34:38.764 --> 01:34:40.498
<i>¶¶And leave
All the frivolous ¶¶</i>

01:34:40.633 --> 01:34:43.601
<i>¶¶Back in America ¶¶</i>

01:34:47.705 --> 01:34:49.072
<i>¶¶You found true love ¶¶</i>

01:34:49.206 --> 01:34:54.009
<i>¶¶In a picture
That you saw somewhere ¶¶</i>

01:34:56.679 --> 01:34:58.280
<i>¶¶He took her hand ¶¶</i>

01:34:58.414 --> 01:35:02.249
<i>¶¶They did cartwheels
Right into the air ¶¶</i>

01:35:04.686 --> 01:35:08.054
<i>¶¶¶¶And then they fell ¶¶¶¶</i>

01:35:43.386 --> 01:35:45.220
<i>Eddy!</i>

01:36:05.204 --> 01:36:06.971
<i>Ma?</i>

01:36:14.111 --> 01:36:16.112
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

01:36:18.748 --> 01:36:20.582
<i>I'm fishing with Eddy.</i>

01:36:38.498 --> 01:36:39.765
<i>Cripes O'Reilly.</i>

01:36:39.900 --> 01:36:43.302
<i>It's Glum Gus.</i>

01:36:47.206 --> 01:36:48.873
<i>His name is...</i>

01:36:51.443 --> 01:36:53.243
<i>Gus.</i>

01:37:04.987 --> 01:37:06.822
<i>Hen?</i>

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:30.141
<i>People often don't know
what they're talking about.</i>

01:37:30.275 --> 01:37:32.376
<i>But when they talk
about love...</i>

01:37:32.511 --> 01:37:36.114
<i>they really don't know
what they're talking about.</i>

01:37:36.247 --> 01:37:38.315
<i>The one sure thing
you can say about love...</i>

01:37:38.449 --> 01:37:41.218
<i>is that there isn't much
you can say about it.</i>

01:37:41.352 --> 01:37:42.885
<i>Not that you shouldn't try.</i>

01:37:43.019 --> 01:37:44.520
<i>You can make analogies.</i>

01:37:44.654 --> 01:37:46.455
<i>Love is like a lot of things.</i>

01:37:46.590 --> 01:37:49.257
<i>One thing it's like
is a trout stream.</i>

01:37:49.391 --> 01:37:52.127
<i>Try to capture
a trout stream with a dam...</i>

01:37:52.261 --> 01:37:53.795
<i>and you get a lake.</i>

01:37:53.929 --> 01:37:55.597
<i>Try to catch it in a bucket...</i>

01:37:55.730 --> 01:37:57.631
<i>and you get a bucket
of water.</i>

01:37:57.766 --> 01:37:59.500
<i>Put some under a microscope...</i>

01:37:59.634 --> 01:38:00.968
<i>and you get a close-up look...</i>

01:38:01.102 --> 01:38:03.903
<i>at some writhing
micro-cooties.</i>

01:38:04.037 --> 01:38:07.774
<i>But a trout stream...</i>

01:38:07.908 --> 01:38:10.375
<i>is only a trout stream...</i>

01:38:10.510 --> 01:38:14.179
<i>when it's flowing
between its own two banks...</i>

01:38:14.313 --> 01:38:17.548
<i>at its own pace...</i>

01:38:17.682 --> 01:38:20.184
<i>in its own sweet way.</i>

01:38:39.168 --> 01:38:41.035
<i>Run run river</i>

01:38:41.170 --> 01:38:45.305
<i>¶¶Carry me to my home
In the ocean ¶¶</i>

01:38:45.439 --> 01:38:48.541
<i>¶¶Carry me away ¶¶</i>

01:38:50.911 --> 01:38:52.945
<i>¶¶I know I have a home ¶¶</i>

01:38:53.079 --> 01:38:56.948
<i>¶¶Somewhere far and removed
Like the stars ¶¶</i>

01:38:57.082 --> 01:39:01.185
<i>¶¶That make you feeI
Like you got friends ¶¶</i>

01:39:01.319 --> 01:39:04.721
<i>¶¶Stars'll make you feeI ¶¶</i>

01:39:04.856 --> 01:39:08.558
<i>¶¶Like you got friends ¶¶</i>

01:39:37.317 --> 01:39:39.518
<i>¶¶Follow the empty valley ¶¶</i>

01:39:39.652 --> 01:39:43.821
<i>¶¶Past the hills To the
marshes Of the estuary ¶¶</i>

01:39:43.956 --> 01:39:49.326
<i>¶¶Come in peacefuI
river ¶¶</i>

01:39:49.460 --> 01:39:51.595
<i>¶¶In the light of the moon ¶¶</i>

01:39:51.729 --> 01:39:53.896
<i>¶¶With the river I do run ¶¶</i>

01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:58.834
<i>¶¶In the hope that one day
I will dive ¶¶</i>

01:39:58.969 --> 01:40:02.770
<i>¶¶Beneath the ocean ¶¶</i>

01:40:05.074 --> 01:40:09.843
<i>¶¶¶¶And that this river
Will forever run ¶¶¶¶</i>

01:40:53.848 --> 01:40:57.150
