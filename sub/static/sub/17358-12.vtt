00:21.873 --> 00:22.741
Kevin!

00:22.741 --> 00:25.243
What are you doing?

00:25.243 --> 00:27.045
Smoking the weed

00:27.045 --> 00:29.147
that I found hanging over the door.

00:29.147 --> 00:30.849
That's mistletoe, silly!

00:30.849 --> 00:33.651
Oh God, well, whatever
this strain is called,

00:33.651 --> 00:36.855
it's uh... it's pretty weak!

00:36.855 --> 00:37.722
I mean, it's getting me there,

00:37.722 --> 00:38.990
halfway there.

00:38.990 --> 00:40.959
So my friend Millie invited us to

00:40.959 --> 00:42.827
a little Christmas Eve party tonight.

00:42.827 --> 00:43.895
Uh, Millie?

00:43.895 --> 00:45.163
Yeah. My friend who died

00:45.163 --> 00:46.765
in the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire.

00:46.765 --> 00:48.299
She died on her period.

00:48.299 --> 00:49.868
- I've told you about her!
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:49.868 --> 00:51.102
I remember who she is. Yeah, she's great.

00:51.102 --> 00:52.904
I just... I don't know, Sue.

00:52.904 --> 00:54.806
Like a ghost party?

00:54.806 --> 00:57.008
I, like, I deal with
ghosts all day every day.

00:57.008 --> 00:58.243
The last thing I want to do is hang out

00:58.243 --> 01:01.046
with them off the clock.

01:01.046 --> 01:02.647
Wow.

01:02.647 --> 01:03.948
- I didn't...
- You know what?

01:03.948 --> 01:05.817
Don't bother coming to the party.

01:05.817 --> 01:07.185
You're off the clock.

01:07.185 --> 01:08.720
Merry Christmas.

01:08.720 --> 01:09.821
Come on, Sue.

01:09.821 --> 01:11.489
I don't... Ugh.

01:11.489 --> 01:13.658
It's the mistletoe talking!

01:15.593 --> 01:17.195
Well, at least I have you.

01:17.195 --> 01:20.198
Fuck you, dude.

01:20.198 --> 01:21.032
What?

01:22.100 --> 01:23.268
Yo, this is Tyson.

01:23.268 --> 01:24.169
Leave a message.

01:24.169 --> 01:25.103
For real!

01:25.103 --> 01:27.105
Hey! Hey playa!

01:27.105 --> 01:29.974
Uh... hey Tyson. It's Pac.

01:29.974 --> 01:32.110
I'm, uh... I'm just looking

01:32.110 --> 01:33.645
to score some drugs, you know?

01:33.645 --> 01:35.013
Like, maybe some drugs that can help

01:35.013 --> 01:37.682
with emotion sickness?

01:37.682 --> 01:39.951
Actually, just any drugs will do.

01:39.951 --> 01:42.654
I can't pay you in cash,
little bit strapped,

01:42.654 --> 01:45.156
but maybe I can pay you
in, like, admiration?

01:45.156 --> 01:47.926
Or uh, maybe I have some frozen pizzas?

01:47.926 --> 01:49.594
You like frozen pizzas, don't you?

01:52.130 --> 01:52.964
Never mind.

03:28.026 --> 03:29.594
Holy shit.

03:29.594 --> 03:30.595
Santa?

03:30.595 --> 03:33.198
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

03:35.567 --> 03:36.568
Boo!

03:36.568 --> 03:38.503
Yo, yo, yo! Merry Christmas!

03:38.503 --> 03:40.538
- Merry Christmas.
- Where's your dude?

03:40.538 --> 03:42.006
Oh, um. He couldn't make it.

03:42.006 --> 03:44.108
Ah, well, his loss. This party is gonna be

03:44.108 --> 03:45.577
off the motherfucking chain!

03:45.577 --> 03:46.945
- Really?
- Yeah!

03:46.945 --> 03:48.112
Okay, so the girl who died here yesterday,

03:48.112 --> 03:49.480
the one whose party it is?

03:49.480 --> 03:51.015
She is pretty rad.

03:51.015 --> 03:53.751
And my pilgrim buddy Chaz is coming,

03:53.751 --> 03:55.220
and this chick who died on 9/11

03:55.220 --> 03:56.521
who is hilarious.

03:56.521 --> 03:57.555
You're gonna love her.

03:57.555 --> 03:59.157
- Nice!
- Oh, holy shit!

03:59.157 --> 04:00.959
Did you hear about the food truck accident?

04:00.959 --> 04:02.126
What food truck accident?

04:02.126 --> 04:03.695
Oh my God. Let's just say

04:03.695 --> 04:06.531
that James McAvoy is a maybe.

04:06.531 --> 04:07.799
- What?
- Yeah!

04:07.799 --> 04:08.933
Oh my God. I'm dying.

04:08.933 --> 04:10.168
So is he!

04:10.168 --> 04:12.003
What's the matter, young man?

04:12.003 --> 04:14.806
Surprised to learn that Santa is a ghost?

04:14.806 --> 04:16.040
Uhh... quite frankly,

04:16.040 --> 04:17.507
I would be more surprised to learn

04:17.507 --> 04:18.509
that he was alive.

04:18.509 --> 04:19.978
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

04:19.978 --> 04:21.012
Good one!

04:21.946 --> 04:23.281
But it's the truth.

04:23.281 --> 04:27.018
I've been a ghost this entire time.

04:27.018 --> 04:30.021
Bull-fucking-shit.

04:30.021 --> 04:31.489
Ho-ho-ho!

04:31.489 --> 04:32.257
Language!

04:32.257 --> 04:34.192
Hey, fuck you, man.

04:34.192 --> 04:35.560
There is no Santa Claus.

04:35.560 --> 04:36.761
There never was, okay?

04:36.761 --> 04:37.795
And you wanna know how I know?

04:37.795 --> 04:40.064
I'll tell ya!

04:40.064 --> 04:41.065
I was a little boy in the orphanage

04:41.065 --> 04:42.000
and the older kids told me

04:42.000 --> 04:43.668
that if I was really good,

04:43.668 --> 04:46.204
I could ask Santa for
any present in the world.

04:46.204 --> 04:47.639
All I wanted was a candy bar

04:47.639 --> 04:49.874
called Spirit Chocolate Crunch.

04:49.874 --> 04:51.175
It had a little ghost
cartoon on the wrapper,

04:51.175 --> 04:53.244
which appealed to me as a child medium.

04:53.244 --> 04:54.812
It also had nougat and tasted like

04:54.812 --> 04:57.982
what I imagined parents smelled like.

04:57.982 --> 04:59.217
When I found my present,

04:59.217 --> 05:01.653
I was so happy I could have cried!

05:01.653 --> 05:02.687
I immediately shoved

05:02.687 --> 05:05.690
the whole thing into my mouth.

05:05.690 --> 05:08.559
Needless to say, it was not chocolate.

05:08.559 --> 05:09.994
But why did you eat it?

05:09.994 --> 05:11.796
Didn't you smell it first?

05:11.796 --> 05:13.665
I had a cold that day.

05:13.665 --> 05:14.699
But it was unwrapped.

05:14.699 --> 05:16.100
I know. I know! Okay?

05:16.100 --> 05:17.835
I know. Don't you think I know that?

05:17.835 --> 05:18.770
It doesn't matter. The point is,

05:18.770 --> 05:19.937
Santa failed me.

05:19.937 --> 05:21.105
Well, I'll go to the store

05:21.105 --> 05:22.240
and get you another candy bar.

05:22.240 --> 05:23.508
You can't! You can't

05:23.508 --> 05:24.642
because they discontinued

05:24.642 --> 05:26.077
Spirit Crunch 25 years ago!

05:26.077 --> 05:27.245
Well then, I'll get you
a different candy bar!

05:27.245 --> 05:28.579
I don't want another one!

05:28.579 --> 05:29.747
I want that one.

05:29.747 --> 05:30.948
All right! Fine!

05:30.948 --> 05:33.851
Fine, fine! Just stop already.

05:33.851 --> 05:35.720
Jeez.

05:37.689 --> 05:39.691
I'm not actually Santa.

05:39.691 --> 05:41.259
My name is Gary, Gary Poquette.

05:41.259 --> 05:42.927
I'm just a regular guy

05:42.927 --> 05:44.195
who used to dress up as Santa

05:44.195 --> 05:45.830
every December at the Fairfield Mall.

05:45.830 --> 05:47.265
There. Now, you happy?

05:47.265 --> 05:48.900
No, actually, I'm a little more sad.

05:48.900 --> 05:50.568
But that's why I'm here.

05:50.568 --> 05:53.604
'Cause I want you to deliver that present.

05:53.604 --> 05:56.641
Yeah... I'm not gonna do that.

05:56.641 --> 05:59.644
Oh, I think you will
if you ever want to see

05:59.644 --> 06:01.913
your precious weed again.

06:01.913 --> 06:03.781
My heartache medicine!

06:03.781 --> 06:05.049
No!

06:06.584 --> 06:07.819
Ahhh!

06:10.021 --> 06:13.057
No!

06:34.059 --> 06:35.895
Herro?

07:01.020 --> 07:02.221
Oh.

07:02.221 --> 07:03.255
Oh, that's so fucking good.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.994
Huh... hi?

07:08.994 --> 07:10.296
Can we help you, bro?

07:10.296 --> 07:11.197
What... what is this?

07:11.197 --> 07:12.264
What are you guys?

07:12.264 --> 07:13.933
We're a brotherhood.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.534
A brotherhood of Santas.

07:15.534 --> 07:17.036
A Santahood, if you will.

07:17.036 --> 07:18.804
I most certainly will not.

07:18.804 --> 07:21.540
Hey, take it easy, guy.

07:21.540 --> 07:24.643
This is a safe place, a secret society

07:24.643 --> 07:27.646
where Santa enthusiasts can gather.

07:27.646 --> 07:30.082
What the fuck is a Santa enthusiast?

07:30.082 --> 07:31.584
We're just regular bros

07:31.584 --> 07:32.852
who dig dressing up as Santa Claus

07:32.852 --> 07:34.920
for various Santa-centric holidays

07:34.920 --> 07:35.921
throughout the year.

07:35.921 --> 07:38.691
Uh, like Christmas?

07:38.691 --> 07:41.994
Uh, yeah, that's definitely one example.

07:41.994 --> 07:44.263
All right, hey bros, I... I just

07:44.263 --> 07:46.565
wanna drop off a present,
maybe finish the milk...

07:46.565 --> 07:47.933
Whoa, whoa, sorry, bro.

07:47.933 --> 07:49.969
You can't leave presents here.

07:49.969 --> 07:51.303
Brothers only.

07:51.303 --> 07:53.205
Okay. All right, well, you know, I'm in.

07:53.205 --> 07:54.673
Hey, how do I become a brother?

07:54.673 --> 07:56.642
Newsflash, brah.

07:56.642 --> 07:58.978
You can't just choose to be a member

07:58.978 --> 08:02.548
of Sigma Alpha Nu Tau Alpha.

08:02.548 --> 08:04.283
Yeah, dawg! You gotta get initiated.

08:04.283 --> 08:07.920
Okay, dawgs! So initiate me.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.556
All right, bitch.

08:10.556 --> 08:12.591
Welcome to pledge.

08:15.294 --> 08:16.562
Oh boy.

08:19.965 --> 08:21.967
Thank you so much for inviting me, Millie.

08:21.967 --> 08:23.702
I'm having such a good time.

08:23.702 --> 08:24.970
Yay! I knew you would.

08:24.970 --> 08:26.872
- Good peeps, right?
- Yeah!

08:26.872 --> 08:28.340
Truth or dare, bitches!

08:28.340 --> 08:30.709
Let's get this shit started.

08:30.709 --> 08:32.077
Oh my God, Sue.

08:32.077 --> 08:33.546
Have you played truth or dare as a ghost?

08:33.546 --> 08:35.214
How is it different than
regular Truth or Dare?

08:35.214 --> 08:37.650
Uh, remember the anonymous phone call

08:37.650 --> 08:38.884
that led to Watergate?

08:38.884 --> 08:40.519
- Yeah.
- Ghost dare.

08:40.519 --> 08:42.254
- What?!
- Yeah, I know!

08:42.254 --> 08:43.856
You have to play!

08:43.856 --> 08:44.924
Okay?

08:50.863 --> 08:52.097
Hi.

08:52.097 --> 08:53.899
Fuck you!

08:53.899 --> 08:55.568
Look, I'm sorry I didn't tell you

08:55.568 --> 08:57.303
about the fraternity. I
just didn't have time...

08:57.303 --> 09:00.072
I had to get that present
delivered by tonight.

09:00.072 --> 09:01.206
What are you talking about?

09:01.206 --> 09:02.274
Oh, they're not gonna like that.

09:02.274 --> 09:03.142
- Gary!
- All right!

09:03.142 --> 09:04.777
Look, before I died,

09:04.777 --> 09:07.146
I was a member of this
Secret Santa Society,

09:07.146 --> 09:08.247
until one of my brothers

09:08.247 --> 09:09.848
stabbed me in the back.

09:09.848 --> 09:11.050
Right in front of my face.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.117
All right. What happened?

09:12.117 --> 09:13.285
Well, it was last year's

09:13.285 --> 09:14.887
Secret Santa Gift Exchange,

09:14.887 --> 09:16.889
and everything was going really well

09:16.889 --> 09:20.159
until Santa Juan opened his gift.

09:20.159 --> 09:22.561
- What was it?
- It was the vagina wallet

09:22.561 --> 09:25.097
I had given Bill the year before!

09:25.097 --> 09:26.632
The vagina wallet?

09:26.632 --> 09:28.000
Yeah, I found it on Etsy?

09:28.000 --> 09:29.101
Looks like a vagina; it opens...

09:29.101 --> 09:30.636
Hey, that's not the point!

09:30.636 --> 09:32.871
The point is that Bill regifted my gift.

09:32.871 --> 09:35.007
Do you have any idea what
that means to a Santa?

09:35.007 --> 09:36.909
It is the ultimate slap in the face.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.711
Who the hell are you talking to, Neophyte?

09:38.711 --> 09:39.945
Oh well.

09:39.945 --> 09:42.948
There's the fat, four-eyed fuck now.

09:42.948 --> 09:44.917
No one.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.720
Let's get one thing straight, grinchface.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.022
We do not need you.

09:50.022 --> 09:52.758
You need us!

09:52.758 --> 09:53.792
And you're gonna demonstrate

09:53.792 --> 09:55.094
how much you need us

09:55.094 --> 09:57.529
by going through a series of tasks,

09:57.529 --> 09:59.531
each designed to push you

09:59.531 --> 10:01.133
to your physical, mental,

10:01.133 --> 10:03.168
and holiday spiritual limits.

10:03.168 --> 10:04.837
Do I make myself clear?

10:04.837 --> 10:06.138
Sure, yeah, sure!

10:09.775 --> 10:11.143
Nog me!

10:25.090 --> 10:27.926
Let's do this shit.

10:55.054 --> 10:56.855
Naughty.

10:56.855 --> 10:58.724
Nice.

10:58.724 --> 10:59.658
Naughty.

11:12.037 --> 11:14.339
Awanata, truth or dare?

11:14.339 --> 11:15.641
Okay...

11:15.641 --> 11:17.109
- Dare.
- Okay.

11:17.109 --> 11:18.811
When James McAvoy gets here...

11:18.811 --> 11:20.646
Oh, you guys didn't hear?

11:20.646 --> 11:22.281
Oh, McAvoy pulled through.

11:22.281 --> 11:24.116
- Oh no!
- Awww.

11:24.116 --> 11:27.619
Okay, um, okay, then I dare you

11:27.619 --> 11:28.687
to go in the corner

11:28.687 --> 11:30.656
and kiss that weird guy.

11:31.990 --> 11:34.026
Me?

11:34.026 --> 11:35.627
No, wait, truth!

11:35.627 --> 11:36.995
- No!
- No backsies!

11:36.995 --> 11:41.233
- No backsies!
- Awww. Fine.

11:50.342 --> 11:51.944
Ay, Chihuahua.

11:51.944 --> 11:53.178
Hey Scrooge Nuts?

11:53.178 --> 11:55.080
You really think we're gonna let you in?

11:55.080 --> 11:56.849
You're freaking worthless.

11:56.849 --> 11:58.817
You're more worthless than Rudolph

11:58.817 --> 12:02.817
before they realized
what his nose could do!

12:03.622 --> 12:05.657
You're doing great, by the way.

12:05.657 --> 12:07.726
Keep it up, bro.

12:09.795 --> 12:11.196
Now sing, you son of a bitch!

12:11.196 --> 12:12.631
Sing!

12:12.631 --> 12:15.067
♪ Silent night ♪

12:15.067 --> 12:18.003
Ow! Fuckin' ♪ Holy... ♪

12:18.003 --> 12:20.539
Oh! ♪... Night ♪

12:20.539 --> 12:22.207
♪ All is calm... ♪

12:22.207 --> 12:23.308
Oh!

12:23.308 --> 12:26.678
♪ All is bright ♪

12:28.781 --> 12:30.048
He's ready!

12:52.638 --> 12:54.239
The Santa Claus.

13:05.083 --> 13:06.084
USA!

13:06.084 --> 13:07.286
USA!

13:07.286 --> 13:08.720
USA!

13:08.720 --> 13:09.822
USA!

13:09.822 --> 13:11.690
USA!

13:11.690 --> 13:12.925
Way to go, Pac!

13:12.925 --> 13:14.726
We're in the home stretch.

13:14.726 --> 13:17.162
- Of what?
- My revenge on Bill?

13:17.162 --> 13:19.998
Oh yeah. Right. That.

13:19.998 --> 13:21.834
Do you think we still need to do that?

13:21.834 --> 13:23.135
I don't know, do you really want

13:23.135 --> 13:24.903
your heartbreak medicine back?

13:26.305 --> 13:27.806
Come on, bro!

13:27.806 --> 13:29.575
I got a stocking with your name on it!

13:29.575 --> 13:31.677
That just says Santa.

13:31.677 --> 13:34.179
Well, I guess you're one of us now.

13:38.951 --> 13:41.920
Oh, fuck.

13:42.220 --> 13:47.761
Sue, is it true that you're dating a solid?

13:49.161 --> 13:50.462
Well, I mean, he's a medium,

13:50.462 --> 13:51.897
so it's, like, not a big deal.

13:51.897 --> 13:54.166
Uh-huh. How's the sex?

13:54.166 --> 13:55.367
It's fine.

13:55.367 --> 13:56.601
Okay, do you use a condom?

13:56.601 --> 13:59.171
Or does he, like, jizz through you

13:59.171 --> 14:01.106
onto his own face?

14:04.109 --> 14:05.577
Excuse me, um, I'm just gonna go

14:05.577 --> 14:07.345
freshen up my aura.

14:12.250 --> 14:14.419
Welcome to Secret Santa, bitches.

14:14.419 --> 14:16.922
You all know how this thing works.

14:16.922 --> 14:20.458
Every gift under the tree
has one of our names on it,

14:20.458 --> 14:24.229
and that's it. That's how it works.

14:24.229 --> 14:28.500
All right, this gift is for...

14:28.500 --> 14:30.202
Santa Dylan!

14:31.503 --> 14:32.604
All right!

14:32.604 --> 14:34.973
I wonder what it could be!

14:37.576 --> 14:40.178
Is this some sort of fuckin' joke?

14:42.280 --> 14:44.149
This gift is clearly over

14:44.149 --> 14:46.251
the ten dollar spending limit,

14:46.251 --> 14:49.521
a monumental violation of the rules!

14:49.521 --> 14:52.324
Who bought this present, yo? Who?

14:52.324 --> 14:53.358
That's it.

14:53.358 --> 14:54.259
I'm checking the list.

14:54.259 --> 14:56.561
Check it twice.

14:59.931 --> 15:02.467
- Bill.
- What?

15:02.467 --> 15:04.369
I didn't buy that present.

15:04.369 --> 15:06.304
It's your name, dawg.

15:07.439 --> 15:08.940
Suck it, Bill.

15:08.940 --> 15:10.609
See what life's like on the outside.

15:10.609 --> 15:12.611
You know what this means, Bill.

15:12.611 --> 15:14.079
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait!

15:14.079 --> 15:15.313
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:15.313 --> 15:17.449
What... what are you doing?

15:17.449 --> 15:21.052
I brought that gift.

15:21.052 --> 15:22.387
My brothers, I gotta tell you something...

15:22.387 --> 15:24.055
I'm a medium, and I'm here

15:24.055 --> 15:25.190
with the ghost of a former Santa

15:25.190 --> 15:27.058
named Gary Poquette. Okay?

15:27.058 --> 15:28.326
He's the one who made me bring that present

15:28.326 --> 15:30.495
to bring down Santa Bill.

15:30.495 --> 15:33.131
Bring me down? Why?

15:33.131 --> 15:34.299
Because he's mad at you for regifting

15:34.299 --> 15:36.167
the vagina wallet he gave you.

15:36.167 --> 15:38.303
Hold up!

15:38.303 --> 15:40.138
This was a regift?

15:40.138 --> 15:41.506
Of course not!

15:41.506 --> 15:43.608
Wait, Gary thinks I regifted

15:43.608 --> 15:45.243
the vagina wallet?

15:45.243 --> 15:46.378
Yeah, bro.

15:46.378 --> 15:48.813
You mean this vagina wallet?

15:49.381 --> 15:50.548
What the hell?

15:50.548 --> 15:53.451
I didn't regift anything.

15:53.451 --> 15:56.021
I love this present.

15:56.021 --> 15:57.422
Every time I open it up

15:57.422 --> 15:59.090
and the little lady is staring up at me

15:59.090 --> 16:02.060
every time I buy a Power Bar!

16:02.060 --> 16:03.928
I just wanted to share that experience

16:03.928 --> 16:05.997
with my bro.

16:05.997 --> 16:07.932
I just wanted to be the guy who knew

16:07.932 --> 16:09.968
how to get the perfect present.

16:09.968 --> 16:11.136
When I thought that Santa Bill

16:11.136 --> 16:12.570
had regifted the vagina wallet,

16:12.570 --> 16:15.407
I began to question my
whole purpose in life.

16:15.407 --> 16:17.509
But now I'm finally free!

16:17.509 --> 16:20.478
Thank you for that gift, Pac.

16:46.037 --> 16:46.905
Hey.

16:46.905 --> 16:47.972
Hey.

16:47.972 --> 16:49.341
I'm so sorry about Sean.

16:49.341 --> 16:51.910
- He's an asshole.
- No, he's not.

16:51.910 --> 16:54.979
It's just... maybe
they're all right to laugh.

16:54.979 --> 16:56.948
I mean, a ghost dating a solid?

16:56.948 --> 16:58.350
It's stupid!

16:58.350 --> 16:59.884
How can I be in a relationship with someone

16:59.884 --> 17:01.219
if we're not even on the same plane

17:01.219 --> 17:03.121
of existence?

17:03.121 --> 17:04.289
I guess it all just depends

17:04.289 --> 17:07.058
what you're looking for.

17:07.058 --> 17:09.461
I just wanna date someone who I can feel

17:09.461 --> 17:12.430
without having to be
in someone else's body.

17:12.430 --> 17:14.866
You know?

17:14.866 --> 17:19.002
It's just been so long since I...

17:19.002 --> 17:21.473
- Since I've...
- Felt?

17:30.181 --> 17:33.985
I... I... Millie, I...

17:33.985 --> 17:37.222
Sue, I really like you.

17:37.222 --> 17:39.224
I really like you, too.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.926
Truth or dare?

17:41.926 --> 17:43.194
Dare.

17:43.194 --> 17:46.064
I dare you to kiss me.

17:46.064 --> 17:48.900
I've never been with another ghost before.

17:53.304 --> 17:54.305
Sue?

17:54.305 --> 17:55.206
Sue?

17:55.206 --> 17:56.541
Sue?

17:56.541 --> 17:58.042
Kevin?

17:58.042 --> 17:59.844
Sue! Hey, Sue.

17:59.844 --> 18:01.346
I need to talk to you about tonight

18:01.346 --> 18:02.280
after you left.

18:02.280 --> 18:05.116
The fuck are you doing?

18:05.116 --> 18:07.051
Oh shit, I didn't...

18:07.051 --> 18:08.186
I didn't realize this was gonna be

18:08.186 --> 18:10.121
like a, like a whole thing.

18:10.121 --> 18:12.023
I would've prepared
something a little more,

18:12.023 --> 18:13.258
I don't know, rom-comy?

18:13.258 --> 18:15.860
Like, uh...

18:17.285 --> 18:18.319
No that's... that is stupid.

18:18.319 --> 18:19.621
That's a complete rip-off.

18:19.621 --> 18:21.289
- What do you want?
- Listen, listen Sue!

18:21.289 --> 18:23.091
Tonight after you left

18:23.091 --> 18:25.026
I met the ghost of Santa Claus.

18:25.026 --> 18:26.060
Not the real Santa Claus,

18:26.060 --> 18:27.362
calm down.

18:27.362 --> 18:28.630
Just a mall Santa named Gary Poquette.

18:28.630 --> 18:30.198
But, but I went on this crazy journey

18:30.198 --> 18:32.066
where I, like, pledged a Santa fraternity,

18:32.066 --> 18:34.035
and I became part of, of a gift exchange,

18:34.035 --> 18:35.403
and I thought I was gonna,
like, learn something

18:35.403 --> 18:37.639
about brotherhood, or, like, Christmas,

18:37.639 --> 18:39.674
or, like, believing in
things, but I didn't.

18:39.674 --> 18:41.676
I didn't learn about any
of that goddamn stuff.

18:41.676 --> 18:43.978
All I got was this weed

18:43.978 --> 18:45.146
and this old chocolate bar.

18:45.146 --> 18:47.148
Oh, worst make-up speech ever.

18:47.148 --> 18:48.483
Hey screw you, man!

18:48.483 --> 18:50.318
I... I'm going somewhere with this. Just...

18:50.318 --> 18:51.986
Kevin, what are you doing here?

18:51.986 --> 18:54.088
Okay, look.

18:54.088 --> 18:55.456
I'm sorry about what I said earlier,

18:55.456 --> 18:56.558
about you and ghosts.

18:56.558 --> 18:57.392
I didn't mean that. Okay?

18:57.392 --> 18:58.993
That was bullshit!

18:58.993 --> 19:02.297
I just, like... I was upset.

19:02.297 --> 19:05.333
I was upset 'cause of the whole sex thing.

19:05.333 --> 19:06.968
And you know? I was getting scared,

19:06.968 --> 19:08.369
I started to question...

19:08.369 --> 19:10.405
I started questioning us!

19:10.405 --> 19:12.907
And that scared the shit out of me.

19:12.907 --> 19:14.475
And I know we haven't exactly had

19:14.475 --> 19:16.511
the best of luck finding a sex vessel,

19:16.511 --> 19:18.146
but Sue, tonight, I think I did it.

19:18.146 --> 19:19.547
I think I finally found

19:19.547 --> 19:21.249
the perfect vessel.

19:25.453 --> 19:27.088
An old candy bar?

19:27.088 --> 19:29.257
What? No. Oh, no. Sorry.

19:32.727 --> 19:34.162
Me!

19:50.345 --> 19:52.280
How's it feeling?

19:52.280 --> 19:54.248
It's good.

19:54.248 --> 19:56.584
It's really fucking good.

19:56.584 --> 20:00.021
Why is this weed so fucking good?

20:05.193 --> 20:06.594
This can't be good for me.

20:06.594 --> 20:08.663
- What?
- Huh, nothing, nothing.

20:08.663 --> 20:11.399
Nothing, it's kicking in.

20:11.399 --> 20:13.334
Okay.

20:13.334 --> 20:15.236
Oh my God, it's kicking in.

20:15.236 --> 20:16.571
This is the sweet spot.

20:16.571 --> 20:18.072
You ready?

20:18.072 --> 20:20.441
I think so.

20:30.151 --> 20:33.354
Oh my God.

20:33.354 --> 20:35.456
Kevin, are you here?

20:35.456 --> 20:37.959
Yeah I'm here, I'm here.

20:37.959 --> 20:40.628
Oh my gosh!

20:40.628 --> 20:43.231
I can feel everything.

20:43.231 --> 20:44.399
I know, me too.

20:44.399 --> 20:47.435
I can feel you inside of me.

20:47.435 --> 20:50.304
Oh my gosh.

20:50.304 --> 20:52.240
Okay, let's do this.
