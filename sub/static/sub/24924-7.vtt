00:06.210 --> 00:08.201
[theme music playing]

00:30.110 --> 00:32.351
[Hannah] It's a giant fucking universe.

00:34.320 --> 00:36.902
[Clay] It is a giant universe.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.363
[Hannah] Like, how are we supposed to do
anything significant?

00:41.450 --> 00:43.953
Anything that means anything?
We're not even clots.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.918
But, somehow,
every day feels like life or death, right?

00:48.630 --> 00:51.758
Even though, at some level,
it also feels like nothing matters at all.

00:52.840 --> 00:54.080
Or means anything.

00:54.920 --> 00:59.038
And, like, in a real way, we're all just
accidents of birth, you know?

00:59.470 --> 01:02.928
Like, it's just dumb luck
that we're not having this conversation

01:03.020 --> 01:04.920
somewhere much worse than this basement.

01:05.020 --> 01:10.936
Like, some shantytown in South Asia,
or the frozen north of Iceland,

01:11.020 --> 01:14.023
or a burning desert in Africa.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.106
But that's it.

01:16.200 --> 01:20.523
We are exactly who we are,
in this moment, in this place,

01:20.620 --> 01:22.281
and I think that matters.

01:23.080 --> 01:26.538
Because without you, without me,
everything is different.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.741
I don't know if anything
would be different without me.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.409
I would be different.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.949
Okay, if I do something, it affects you.

01:34.300 --> 01:38.009
Makes you do something that affects,
I don't know, Alex Standall,

01:38.090 --> 01:40.888
who affects Jessica Davis.

01:41.140 --> 01:47.090
[Clay] Who affects Justin Foley,
then Zach Dempsey, then Mrs. Bradley,

01:47.190 --> 01:50.227
-and then Tony Padilla...
-[Hannah] And on and on.

01:50.770 --> 01:52.510
[Clay] It's huge if you think about it.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.971
[Hannah] It's an infinite universe.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.446
[Clay] Infinity.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.157
It's funny we have a word
for that concept,

02:00.240 --> 02:02.697
but there's no way we can understand it.

02:03.790 --> 02:08.033
-Maybe... love?
-Love?

02:09.420 --> 02:12.162
Maybe love is how you understand infinity.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.549
When your love has no limit.
When it goes on forever.

02:17.840 --> 02:20.252
Maybe that feels like infinity.

02:21.470 --> 02:23.847
Yeah. Maybe.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.761
[alarm clock ringing]

02:34.520 --> 02:35.350
[Clay] Hey, Slqe.

02:37.440 --> 02:39.567
It's, uh... It's me again.

02:41.450 --> 02:43.577
Clay. Calling you.

02:45.490 --> 02:48.994
Nothing much new to report.
I go to court today.

02:51.710 --> 02:55.089
To testify. For Hannah.

02:58.170 --> 03:00.001
Still dealing with Justin.

03:01.630 --> 03:02.676
This is weird.

03:04.760 --> 03:07.593
You should have some pancakes.
They're fucking amazing.

03:08.520 --> 03:09.475
[Matt] I'll get you a plate.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.436
Clay, your dad's going to take you
to court today.

03:15.570 --> 03:16.889
[exhales] Great.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.983
-I wish I could be there as well.
-Rea|ly no problem.

03:20.190 --> 03:23.489
I've got this.
And you've got alt-Clay here, so...

03:26.950 --> 03:29.248
But, I mean, things are actually great.

03:30.460 --> 03:31.654
I'm glad to be going to court,

03:31.750 --> 03:34.241
and I really think it's going to be
a good way to get closure.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.462
Yeah, I'm really looking forward
to being done with all this.

03:45.680 --> 03:46.635
I love you.

03:47.970 --> 03:49.380
Call me. Bye.

03:52.390 --> 03:55.439
[Mrs. Standall]
Alex, honey? Wake up. Wake up.

03:56.020 --> 03:58.932
-Alexander.
-What? What happened?

03:59.400 --> 04:01.948
-Sorry, you were sleeping so soundly.
-[sighs]

04:02.740 --> 04:06.198
Sorry, I was dreaming about running.

04:08.530 --> 04:09.656
Happy birthday.

04:11.370 --> 04:13.531
-Oh, wow.
-[laughs]

04:13.620 --> 04:16.077
Right. Thanks.

04:16.960 --> 04:20.919
So I heard from Peter,
and he is driving down this afternoon

04:21.010 --> 04:22.375
to be here in time for the party.

04:22.880 --> 04:23.835
Oh.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.086
Do we have to have a party?

04:26.800 --> 04:29.803
But it's all booked,
and your father got his shift off.

04:29.890 --> 04:31.346
Haven't you told your friends?

04:31.930 --> 04:36.799
Well, yeah, I mean... Plus, they got
your e-vite with the bunnies on it.

04:38.110 --> 04:42.183
-You not feeling up to it?
-No, I am. I totally am.

04:42.690 --> 04:44.567
Good. We'll have fun.

04:44.650 --> 04:46.652
All right. Get yourself up,
do your stretches.

04:46.740 --> 04:49.982
[gasps] And I have a new hemp milk to try.
It's delicious.

04:51.740 --> 04:52.946
[door closes]

04:57.210 --> 04:58.029
[sighs]

05:02.420 --> 05:04.217
You should come _
for a morning run next time.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.757
[chuckles]
I don't run unless I'm being chased.

05:07.470 --> 05:09.040
And even then, I don't run.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.846
You ran pretty fast last night.

05:12.930 --> 05:15.307
Yeah, uh... I'm sorry.

05:15.390 --> 05:17.301
I got a text from Mrs. Baker,
and I had to go--

05:17.400 --> 05:18.594
No excuses needed.

05:20.770 --> 05:23.147
Look, I don't wanna tie you down.

05:23.650 --> 05:25.732
And I don't want you to think
you owe me anything.

05:28.110 --> 05:32.069
But I like you. A lot, I think.

05:43.380 --> 05:44.836
-I'm done early tonight.
-Hmm.

05:44.920 --> 05:46.251
No self-defense class.

05:48.680 --> 05:53.049
-That's quite a group you got there.
-Yeah. Yeah, right?

05:53.850 --> 05:57.434
The, uh, the guy with no eye,
what's his deal?

05:58.350 --> 05:59.840
I don't know, really.

06:00.270 --> 06:03.353
He got beat pretty bad a while back.
I think it was mugging or something.

06:03.940 --> 06:05.646
He takes a few classes.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.026
I think he's working through the PTSD
from the assault.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.400
Seems pretty haunted by it.

06:11.660 --> 06:12.479
Jesus.

06:15.290 --> 06:17.861
-Does he remember much?
-Haven't spoken to him about it.

06:18.460 --> 06:21.532
-There's lots of stories in that class.
-I bet.

06:22.670 --> 06:25.047
Aren't we going the wrong way
for your first period?

06:25.130 --> 06:27.371
Uh, I thought we'd take
the long way today.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.921
-Why is Zach waiting for us?
-[chuckles]

06:31.930 --> 06:36.845
-And why is he smiling like that? What?
-[laughs]

06:37.980 --> 06:42.644
-Wait, is it your birthday?
-[Jessica] Whoo!

06:42.730 --> 06:43.970
-What?
-What?

06:44.070 --> 06:45.970
[Zach, Jessica laugh]

06:46.070 --> 06:49.278
-You guys got a banner made?
-It was a group project.

06:49.360 --> 06:53.319
I made the design, Clay ordered it online,
and Zach put it up.

06:53.910 --> 06:54.979
Wow, that's...

06:57.250 --> 06:59.366
[chuckles] ...that's really, really nice,
you guys.

06:59.960 --> 07:01.245
[Bryce] Aw.

07:02.460 --> 07:04.087
Happy birthday, buddy.

07:04.460 --> 07:06.451
Oh, sweet banner.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.199
Is your mom bringing cupcakes?

07:08.300 --> 07:10.336
I hope she brings enough
for the whole class.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.330
Maybe you'll get a new cane
this year too, huh?

07:12.430 --> 07:14.421
[chuckling] Yeah.

07:14.510 --> 07:15.807
And some new friends.

07:17.470 --> 07:18.767
[Alex] Fuck you!

07:19.520 --> 07:20.885
You fucking rapist!

07:30.190 --> 07:33.694
Dude, shit like that
doesn't do anybody any good.

07:33.780 --> 07:35.577
Yeah? Well, it felt good to me.

07:36.160 --> 07:37.866
Maybe if you'd stop defending him
all the time.

07:37.950 --> 07:40.578
-When have I ever defended him?
-Every day.

07:40.660 --> 07:43.072
Every day you hang around him
and play baseball with him,

07:43.330 --> 07:44.456
you choose his side.

07:44.920 --> 07:45.989
Jess, tell him.

07:47.710 --> 07:49.166
Why would you do that?

07:50.260 --> 07:52.501
Shit. I'm so sorry.

07:53.630 --> 07:55.040
-I mean...
-Jess.

07:56.430 --> 07:57.385
Don't.

08:11.820 --> 08:13.697
Come on, didn't you see the red light?

08:14.200 --> 08:15.406
-It means you're not--
-Hey.

08:16.990 --> 08:17.820
Uh, hi.

08:18.870 --> 08:22.283
-Sorry.
-No, uh, you're-- No big deal.

08:22.370 --> 08:24.418
I know what the red light means.
[chuckles]

08:24.500 --> 08:26.707
So, um, last night was really fun.

08:27.670 --> 08:29.740
We should, maybe, do it again sometime.

08:29.880 --> 08:32.462
We should clean vomit
off your brother's boots?

08:32.670 --> 08:35.798
We should hang out.
Maybe not in the bathroom.

08:36.050 --> 08:38.098
So, hang out in your yard?

08:38.600 --> 08:43.549
Or another building. Restaurant.
Movie theater, perhaps?

08:44.020 --> 08:45.897
-Do you mean, like a--
-I mean, like a date.

08:47.860 --> 08:50.647
It's an early stage in the mating ritual
of homo sapiens.

08:50.940 --> 08:52.350
We agree to go somewhere together.

08:52.530 --> 08:54.020
I obsess over what to wear

08:54.110 --> 08:57.614
and then you obsess over if you should pay
or if we're splitting it.

08:58.200 --> 09:01.533
We show up,
it either goes great or it goes terrible,

09:01.700 --> 09:05.409
and then we decide if we wanna
put ourselves through It again.

09:05.750 --> 09:07.661
What sadistic person invented this ritual?

09:07.750 --> 09:08.626
[Mackenzie chuckles]

09:10.090 --> 09:10.988
Every person.

09:13.170 --> 09:15.218
-So, you wanna?
-Um...

09:16.680 --> 09:19.342
Yes. I-- I really do.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.387
She was faithful.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.302
She was kind to me
and cared about what happened to me.

09:25.520 --> 09:28.762
She never gossiped,
or told lies about people.

09:28.850 --> 09:31.603
And what sorts of things
did you do together?

09:31.690 --> 09:35.103
We had some classes together,
we ate lunch together sometimes,

09:35.490 --> 09:37.481
and we worked together at the Crestmont.

09:37.740 --> 09:39.401
And we talked, a lot.

09:39.740 --> 09:42.197
-What did you talk about?
-We talked about...

09:42.490 --> 09:47.200
about books and shows
and songs and eclipses

09:47.290 --> 09:51.784
and zombies and bike helmets and...

09:52.340 --> 09:55.832
and I guess our... our hopes and dreams.

09:56.420 --> 09:57.250
[Hannah] Helmet.

10:00.390 --> 10:02.551
Helmet. Helmet.

10:03.640 --> 10:06.382
If you don't help build this tower,
you don't get to knock it down.

10:08.230 --> 10:09.766
I-- I just need to finish this chapter.

10:10.480 --> 10:13.859
Do you really have homework?
School's over in, like, two days.

10:13.940 --> 10:16.238
All we do in my classes
is watch Stand and Deliver.

10:19.740 --> 10:25.440
I wanna get the summer reading done
before I, um, leave for my grandparents'

10:25.540 --> 10:26.404
for the summer.

10:27.330 --> 10:28.149
Wait, what?

10:29.620 --> 10:32.032
My parents think it's good
for a "growing boy"

10:32.130 --> 10:34.451
to spend time in the country. [scoffs]

10:34.550 --> 10:36.871
We don't exactly live
in a thriving metropolis.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.927
Ten minutes at my grandparents',
and you would disagree. [chuckles]

10:43.100 --> 10:45.056
What am I supposed to do all summer
without you?

10:46.430 --> 10:49.228
-Wait, you're... you're gonna miss me?
-Of course.

10:49.890 --> 10:51.300
You're the only friend I have left.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.435
Come on, that's not true.

10:55.820 --> 10:58.687
Will you write me,
like, old-school letters?

11:00.200 --> 11:03.272
Yeah. I mean, can I write them
on the computer and print them?

11:03.570 --> 11:05.902
You may not. And no postcards.

11:06.330 --> 11:10.118
_ I_want handwritten missives
filled With your deepest, darkest secrets.

11:11.250 --> 11:12.490
Are you gonna write me back?

11:13.420 --> 11:14.330
"Dear Helmet,

11:14.880 --> 11:16.950
today, someone smeared feces
on the bathroom wall,

11:17.050 --> 11:18.335
and I got to clean it up.

11:18.840 --> 11:23.083
But there was an expired box of Milk Duds
that I got to take home for free."

11:23.180 --> 11:24.966
Those are your deepest
and darkest secrets?

11:26.100 --> 11:27.510
Write me, and you'll find out.

11:30.890 --> 11:32.471
-Whoa!
-[laughs]

11:33.150 --> 11:34.299
I never wrote her.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.235
Ijust...

11:41.070 --> 11:44.562
Summer gets away from you,
and stuff happens.

11:44.950 --> 11:47.657
And I guess I didn't really think
that she'd be thinking of me.

11:47.870 --> 11:50.498
I mean, I didn't think
I was that important.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.743
And you always think that...
you think that you'll have plenty of time.

11:56.670 --> 11:57.489
[whimpers]

12:01.260 --> 12:02.158
I'm sorry.

12:08.430 --> 12:10.136
-What the hell?
-Whatever happened to

12:10.220 --> 12:12.768
"What happens in The Clubhouse
stays in The Clubhouse"?

12:12.850 --> 12:14.556
Not in here. Jesus.

12:15.520 --> 12:18.398
-What the fuck is your problem?
-Somebody's blackmailing me.

12:20.070 --> 12:21.731
If my dad sees that, I'm dead.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.275
Fuck.

12:24.530 --> 12:26.521
Look, you need to help me shut this down.

12:26.870 --> 12:29.020
-I need to?
-You owe me.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.610
I don't owe anybody anything, Marcus.

12:33.410 --> 12:35.287
I got a lot of eyes on me right now, okay?

12:35.370 --> 12:38.248
I can't get involved
in some stripper shit.

12:38.340 --> 12:41.002
-You're already involved. You were there.
-I'm not in the video.

12:41.710 --> 12:42.916
Are you fucking kidding me?

12:43.010 --> 12:45.831
After what I did for you in court,
you can't return the favor?

12:46.140 --> 12:48.677
A favor's only a favor
if someone asks for it.

12:48.760 --> 12:50.967
And I didn't ask you
to drag my name into this shit.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.089
That's on you.

12:52.430 --> 12:54.591
[school bell rings]

12:59.480 --> 13:02.358
Clay, you've testified today
that Hannah was a victim

13:02.440 --> 13:04.943
of a culture of bullying at Liberty High.

13:05.820 --> 13:08.527
But isn't it true
that you are also a part of that culture?

13:08.620 --> 13:09.905
No, I don't think I am.

13:09.990 --> 13:13.494
Isn't it true that you took pictures
of Tyler Down through his window

13:13.580 --> 13:16.617
that you then circulated around the school
via social media?

13:16.710 --> 13:18.621
-Yes, but--
-[Dennis] Objection, Your Honor.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.086
Beyond the scope of the direct.

13:20.170 --> 13:23.162
Your Honor, he's already testified
to the nature of bullying at Liberty.

13:24.010 --> 13:24.965
[judge] I'll allow it.

13:25.050 --> 13:27.678
[Sonya] Clay, isn't it true
that you were suspended from school

13:27.760 --> 13:29.079
for possession of marijuana?

13:29.180 --> 13:31.466
-It wasn't mine. I was set up.
-I see.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.131
And at any point
subsequent to that suspension,

13:34.230 --> 13:35.936
did you attempt to buy more marijuana?

13:36.690 --> 13:39.807
-Yes, but I was--
-And isn't it true that your vandalism

13:39.900 --> 13:42.607
caused thousands of dollars of damage
to Zach Dempsey's car?

13:42.690 --> 13:46.103
I was angry at him.
I... I paid for the damage.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.441
What did you do when you were angry
at Courtney Crimsen?

13:48.530 --> 13:50.020
I just took her to Hannah's grave.

13:50.280 --> 13:53.693
And isn't it true that you accused her
of being responsible for Hannah's death?

13:53.790 --> 13:56.862
She is responsible.
All of those kids are responsible.

13:56.960 --> 14:00.452
Are you responsible, Clay?
Are you responsible for Hannah's death?

14:03.710 --> 14:06.372
Yes, I am. I let her down.

14:06.920 --> 14:10.424
But there are kids who did a lot worse,
kids who you let skate,

14:10.510 --> 14:13.502
who did things you won't even talk about.
And adults at Liberty don't--

14:13.600 --> 14:15.591
[Sonya] Request to strike that
as non-responsive.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.638
[judge] So ordered.
The jury will ignore that answer.

14:18.850 --> 14:21.853
Clay, you've testified
that you were Hannah's friend

14:21.940 --> 14:22.929
but never her boyfriend.

14:23.020 --> 14:24.601
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

14:24.860 --> 14:26.600
And you said that you kissed once.

14:27.280 --> 14:28.986
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.151
Did you ever spend a night together?

14:31.240 --> 14:35.404
You mean, have... have sex? No.

14:35.700 --> 14:39.739
No. I mean, spend a night together,

14:39.830 --> 14:42.537
evening, night, into the next morning.

14:45.210 --> 14:48.464
Clay, did you and Hannah
ever spend a night together?

14:48.920 --> 14:49.796
Yes.

14:50.050 --> 14:51.756
And did you do drugs together?

15:01.310 --> 15:02.140
Yes.

15:04.360 --> 15:06.430
-[music playing]
-[students cheering]

15:06.820 --> 15:07.935
Go, Tigers!

15:09.610 --> 15:12.568
-Hey! Go, Tigers!
-Yeah!

15:13.320 --> 15:15.447
Hey! Go, Tigers!

15:15.740 --> 15:16.616
[air horn blares]

15:18.620 --> 15:20.247
Hey! Go, Tigers!

15:22.290 --> 15:24.121
Hey! Go, Tigers!

15:24.210 --> 15:28.169
[cheering]

15:29.630 --> 15:34.465
[Chle] Let's give it up
for our varsity baseball team!

15:37.220 --> 15:39.211
[student] Go, Tigers!

15:39.640 --> 15:42.382
-[student] Oh, look at him.
-[audience] Aww.

15:42.480 --> 15:45.142
Hey, how about a hand
for our new cheer captain, Chle Rice?

15:45.230 --> 15:50.145
[cheering]

15:50.240 --> 15:51.525
So sweet.

15:52.240 --> 15:56.324
And now, for our emcee
of today's assembly,

15:56.870 --> 15:59.111
Marcus Cole!

15:59.200 --> 16:01.361
-[cheering]
-[music playing]

16:12.420 --> 16:13.250
That's right.

16:14.010 --> 16:18.504
That's right.
I, uh... dressed for the occasion.

16:18.600 --> 16:19.464
Who's impressed?

16:20.100 --> 16:22.091
[cheering]

16:28.980 --> 16:30.891
He turned it
into a fucking publicity stunt.

16:31.440 --> 16:33.351
He's got this whole
fucking school brainwashed.

16:33.450 --> 16:36.237
We have to do something else, man.
Okay? Something bigger.

16:39.030 --> 16:40.076
What did you have in mind?

16:47.000 --> 16:48.536
I'm sorry, Dad.

16:50.090 --> 16:53.082
For what, kiddo? For telling the truth?

16:54.630 --> 16:56.040
For not telling you...

16:59.010 --> 16:59.840
stuff.

17:00.390 --> 17:01.379
And what did you say?

17:01.680 --> 17:05.593
I didn't...
I didn't know what to say. I...

17:08.230 --> 17:09.766
You know there's nothing you could do,

17:11.150 --> 17:15.769
nothing that would stop your mother and me
from loving you.

17:15.990 --> 17:19.062
You heard Hannah say this,
and you did nothing?

17:19.370 --> 17:21.076
I didn't think she meant it like that.

17:23.580 --> 17:29.200
Why is it kids
don't tell their parents anything, ever?

17:31.670 --> 17:32.750
Is it shame?

17:34.380 --> 17:35.210
Or fear?

17:36.930 --> 17:40.093
It can't be fear of punishment.
No one's punished for anything anymore.

17:42.890 --> 17:44.471
Are you afraid we won't understand?

17:46.770 --> 17:49.261
More like afraid
you'd understand too well.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.396
So you're protecting your secrets?

17:51.900 --> 17:54.391
We were all still recovering--

17:54.610 --> 17:58.023
From drugs.
And that explains why you did nothing?

17:59.160 --> 18:00.445
Or we're protecting you.

18:06.870 --> 18:08.201
Look, I have to get to school.

18:13.420 --> 18:17.254
_ Let's welcome
this year's varSIty track team!

18:18.300 --> 18:20.712
-[students cheering]
-[music playing]

18:32.110 --> 18:37.104
[Clay] Hey, Slqe. Me again.
Court was not great.

18:38.740 --> 18:41.231
They found out about this thing
Hannah said one time,

18:41.320 --> 18:43.481
and they blew it way out of proportion.

18:47.580 --> 18:50.788
But now I can't stop thinking
about the morning she said it

18:51.170 --> 18:52.876
and the night we spent before.

18:53.380 --> 18:54.369
[Jeff] Hey, Jensen.

19:00.590 --> 19:01.921
Don't you have a class to get to?

19:03.510 --> 19:05.842
-Don't you guys?
-No, man. We just won State.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.175
They don't make us go to school anymore.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.129
Yeah, you wish.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.016
I'm wondering why
after such an excellent pep rally,

19:14.110 --> 19:16.681
it seems like your pep
has not been rallied.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.230
[chuckles]

19:18.900 --> 19:22.484
-I'm not a pep sort, I guess.
-Okay.

19:24.450 --> 19:26.236
I didn't see you sit next to Hannah.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.035
I never sit next to Hannah.

19:30.710 --> 19:31.779
You always try to.

19:32.830 --> 19:33.910
[chuckles]

19:34.000 --> 19:34.910
Not lately.

19:39.670 --> 19:42.173
Remember that poem
that everyone was talking about?

19:42.550 --> 19:44.791
Everyone was talking about a poem?
How is that possible?

19:44.890 --> 19:46.380
Who talks about poems?

19:46.470 --> 19:48.347
[stammers] I-- Aanay...

19:49.640 --> 19:50.629
I made fun of it.

19:52.020 --> 19:55.512
And I didn't know it was hers, and...

19:55.980 --> 19:59.472
Man, if you and Hannah's relationship
were a novel,

19:59.990 --> 20:03.027
a major theme would be "mistakes."

20:04.200 --> 20:05.235
Thank you.

20:07.740 --> 20:08.820
We'll figure this out.

20:09.870 --> 20:12.532
The last time I took your advice,
she ran out on me at the dance.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.070
No, no, no, no,
that wasn't my fault, all right?

20:15.170 --> 20:16.489
IfI recall correctly,

20:16.880 --> 20:20.043
it was your nerves and uptight nature
that just ruined everything.

20:20.630 --> 20:24.043
Look, you both
are just too hung up on shit.

20:25.930 --> 20:27.170
We'll work on this.

20:27.430 --> 20:29.000
I don't have an uptight nature.

20:31.520 --> 20:32.805
[both chuckle]

20:34.100 --> 20:37.012
You know what? We're gonna have
a gathering this weekend.

20:37.110 --> 20:40.273
Me, you, Hannah, my girl, Leah,
and some friends. I'll text you.

20:42.610 --> 20:46.239
-I don't really do parties.
-Oh, you'll do this one.

21:07.300 --> 21:10.178
We're taking State this year.
And it's for him.

21:13.810 --> 21:17.348
He was what a teammate should be. Loyal.

21:17.440 --> 21:20.102
-Yeah, he always had your back.
-Never had to wonder about that.

21:21.820 --> 21:23.105
And he looked out for people.

21:24.190 --> 21:26.351
Always took care of his guys,
no questions asked.

21:26.780 --> 21:28.566
-Yeah.
-Right.

21:34.960 --> 21:40.080
[Clay] Ijust keep thinking... did I miss
something huge, like I did with you?

21:44.010 --> 21:45.045
What are you doing here?

21:46.630 --> 21:49.793
I stayed to watch them hang Jeff's jersey.

21:51.470 --> 21:52.630
Yeah, me, too.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.550
How'd it go, in court?

21:59.600 --> 22:00.601
Not well.

22:03.110 --> 22:05.567
-I'm sorry.
-They asked me about the party at Jeff's.

22:06.030 --> 22:07.236
Before summer, last year.

22:07.780 --> 22:09.657
Oh, shit. How'd they know about that?

22:11.410 --> 22:13.822
God, no, Clay. I would never.

22:14.370 --> 22:15.189
I swear.

22:17.330 --> 22:20.242
Someone must've brought it up
at their deposition. Maybe Leah.

22:20.960 --> 22:22.416
It doesn't matter now.

22:24.050 --> 22:26.006
Was there anything in your text messages?

22:27.340 --> 22:28.625
No. Why?

22:28.720 --> 22:32.133
Well, 'cause the other night, your mom,
she was asking me about a text.

22:35.430 --> 22:38.137
Look, anyways, I'm sure it's not as bad
as you think it is.

22:40.520 --> 22:41.475
It's worse.

22:42.690 --> 22:44.601
[register clicks]

22:44.690 --> 22:47.682
[Clay] And, like,
what other signs have I missed?

22:49.150 --> 22:51.198
-[man] Call if you have questions.
-[Deputy Standall] Got it.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.939
-Good seeing you.
-Thanks, man.

22:53.030 --> 22:53.860
Let's go, bud.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.076
You good?

22:56.660 --> 22:57.740
Oh, hey, there he is.

22:58.660 --> 23:01.413
-Tyler, good to see you.
-Good to see you too, sir.

23:01.670 --> 23:02.568
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:02.670 --> 23:05.127
Baker Drugs.
This is a little out of your way, yeah?

23:05.210 --> 23:08.213
Yeah. Uh, they carry some stuff
that the WalPlex doesn't, so...

23:08.630 --> 23:10.757
Uh, so we're gonna see you
at the party tonight?

23:11.300 --> 23:13.882
Oh, I-- I didn't know, so--

23:13.970 --> 23:16.177
I thought that you invited
all your friends.

23:16.260 --> 23:17.761
Yeah, well, Jessica was supposed to--

23:17.850 --> 23:19.761
It's at the Epicenter tonight.
Come if you can.

23:19.850 --> 23:21.386
Alex would love to have you there.

23:21.480 --> 23:23.766
-I don't know. I don't wanna--
-[Alex] You should come.

23:23.940 --> 23:25.510
-Rea|ly. You should.
-Yeah?

23:25.610 --> 23:26.429
[both] Yeah.

23:27.530 --> 23:30.192
-Okay. Yeah, I'll be there.
-[Deputy Standall] Good.

23:30.280 --> 23:31.690
-Good to see you.
-Yeah, you, too.

23:31.780 --> 23:33.361
-Right on.
-Later.

23:33.910 --> 23:34.865
Later.

23:36.790 --> 23:38.940
Don't they do any fucking maintenance
at this place?

23:39.040 --> 23:40.200
-[Andy] Olivia.
-Seriously.

23:40.290 --> 23:42.201
With what we pay for this plot?

23:42.290 --> 23:45.999
-I'|| speak to them on the way out.
-They promised weekly maintenance.

23:46.090 --> 23:49.799
-They can't even cut the fucking grass.
-Liv.

23:49.880 --> 23:50.790
Liv.

23:52.970 --> 23:53.789
[sighs]

23:56.600 --> 23:58.215
This day, Andy...

24:00.810 --> 24:04.394
I don't-- I'm not even sure
how well that kid knew Hannah.

24:04.480 --> 24:05.390
He knew her well.

24:07.230 --> 24:08.686
I think he was in love with her.

24:11.530 --> 24:12.565
He's a good kid.

24:15.780 --> 24:17.691
Yeah, who encouraged her
to do some bad things.

24:17.780 --> 24:19.486
One. One thing, and it wasn't...

24:21.160 --> 24:22.115
it wasn't that bad.

24:23.420 --> 24:24.819
Nothing that you and...

24:26.170 --> 24:27.910
you and I didn't do in high school.

24:28.920 --> 24:31.161
But what she said to him
the next morning--

24:31.260 --> 24:33.831
I've said to myself over the years.

24:36.930 --> 24:39.808
Was it my fault, Andy? Did I...?

24:40.350 --> 24:42.591
Was she sick? Did I give something to her?

24:42.680 --> 24:44.432
-God, no.
-The women in my family--

24:44.520 --> 24:48.263
Stop, Liv. Just stop.
Our Hannah was very happy.

24:48.360 --> 24:52.433
She was kind, intelligent, beautiful,
and she was very, very happy.

24:52.900 --> 24:54.356
That's our Hannah.

25:01.660 --> 25:02.820
[Olivia sobs]

25:06.170 --> 25:09.412
We were happy, weren't we?

25:10.590 --> 25:11.579
We were happy.

25:31.650 --> 25:32.526
Andy...

25:35.360 --> 25:36.236
Andy...

25:37.740 --> 25:39.025
Should we go have some dinner?

25:44.250 --> 25:45.399
These are kinda cute.

25:46.410 --> 25:48.378
-They're all right.
-I need more yoga pants.

25:48.540 --> 25:51.668
I mean, how many pairs of yoga pants
does one person need?

25:52.090 --> 25:56.208
-I mean, do you even do yoga?
-I do, I--

25:56.300 --> 25:58.040
-All right. Shut up.
-[laughs]

25:59.220 --> 26:00.881
How long have you been together?

26:01.470 --> 26:05.133
Uh, it'll be five months next Thursday.

26:05.770 --> 26:07.385
Damn. Has it been that long already?

26:08.140 --> 26:11.303
Wow, okay. Don't act so excited now.

26:11.400 --> 26:12.810
-Uh...
-[laughs]

26:12.900 --> 26:16.484
See, that's her way of saying,
"I can't get enough of you, baby."

26:16.570 --> 26:20.609
Wow. You guys are adorable.
And by that, I mean disgusting.

26:20.740 --> 26:21.900
[chuckles]

26:23.580 --> 26:25.195
I'll let you guys do your thing.

26:25.290 --> 26:26.530
-All right. Thanks.
-All right.

26:35.420 --> 26:37.752
So is he, like, in college, or...?

26:38.550 --> 26:40.586
[Nina] Uh, junior college.

26:40.680 --> 26:44.218
But he's transferring to Berkeley
for fall semester. Pre-law.

26:44.310 --> 26:48.178
-Shit. He's kind of amazing.
-I know, right?

26:49.690 --> 26:53.262
But, I mean, hey, I deserve amazing.

26:54.400 --> 26:55.640
So do you, by the way.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.391
Whenever you're ready
to get back out there.

27:03.580 --> 27:05.866
[Bryce] Shh. Shh. Don't worry about it.

27:06.410 --> 27:08.321
-Just having fun.
-What are you doing? Please!

27:19.880 --> 27:21.006
Don't worry about it.

27:21.090 --> 27:23.081
-Just having fun.
-What are you doing? Please!

27:23.760 --> 27:24.590
[gaSPS]

27:25.890 --> 27:27.050
[Jessica] Please. No.

27:27.140 --> 27:28.721
[panﬁng]

27:36.940 --> 27:38.931
[sobbing]

27:40.740 --> 27:41.695
[alarm beeping]

27:41.780 --> 27:45.739
Jessica! Hey. Hey. What's--

27:45.830 --> 27:46.865
You need to pay for that.

27:46.950 --> 27:50.499
Uh, no, here, it was an accident.
I'm sorry. She's not buying it.

27:51.120 --> 27:52.667
Jess. Hey.

27:52.750 --> 27:55.287
-[Jessica] I'm sorry. [panting]
-[alarm stops]

27:59.630 --> 28:02.042
It's okay. It's okay.

28:04.090 --> 28:04.966
Are you okay?

28:08.060 --> 28:12.099
Yeah, must have been a trigger
or something.

28:12.190 --> 28:14.556
Security tag triggered the alarm.
It's no big deal.

28:15.020 --> 28:16.681
Are you sure you're okay?

28:16.770 --> 28:20.433
Um, babe, can you get us some gelato,
actually? Please?

28:20.900 --> 28:22.891
-Good idea.
-Thank you so much.

28:23.820 --> 28:24.946
-My treat.
-Thanks.

28:27.490 --> 28:30.197
He knows how we know each other, right?

28:31.000 --> 28:32.706
Uh, well, yeah. School.

28:35.460 --> 28:37.371
I don't let what happened to me define me.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.127
So why should I tell him
when it's not who I am?

28:41.760 --> 28:43.216
Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

28:47.470 --> 28:50.462
-[Olivia] Haven't been here in a while.
-It didn't feel right at first.

28:53.100 --> 28:54.010
How's the store?

28:55.150 --> 28:58.358
Uh, yeah, I was able to find
some new distributors

28:58.440 --> 29:01.773
for a lot of the items _
so we could compete, price-Wise.

29:02.530 --> 29:04.236
Cosmetics, for one, so...

29:04.320 --> 29:05.605
-That's great.
-Yeah.

29:05.820 --> 29:07.151
And the new pharmacist?

29:08.740 --> 29:09.650
He's good.

29:09.870 --> 29:13.112
He's young, so he knows the medicine part,
but not the people part.

29:16.080 --> 29:19.538
What about you? How's WalPlex?

29:20.090 --> 29:22.126
-Getting used to it.
-Yeah.

29:22.710 --> 29:24.758
I realized that I liked being my own boss,

29:24.840 --> 29:28.173
or letting you be the boss.

29:33.350 --> 29:36.262
-I don't know the right way to say this.
-Just say it, Andy.

29:41.020 --> 29:42.931
We need to finalize things, Liv.

29:43.990 --> 29:45.639
We can't stay in limbo forever.

29:52.370 --> 29:55.248
This is about the divorce?

29:59.750 --> 30:01.377
I don't wanna wait till after the trial.

30:02.000 --> 30:02.989
We need to move on.

30:04.800 --> 30:07.621
-You wanna marry her.
-No. Iwant...

30:10.180 --> 30:12.592
I wanna close a door
that I can never go back through.

30:19.020 --> 30:19.839
Yes.

30:22.940 --> 30:23.816
I see.

30:28.400 --> 30:32.939
[Clay] Hey, Slqe. It's me. Again.

30:33.910 --> 30:36.117
Listen, I don't know
if you get news there.

30:36.200 --> 30:37.861
Uh, you might hear about...

30:39.330 --> 30:42.584
about stuff I did that came out in court.

30:43.670 --> 30:44.876
It's kind of bad.

30:45.420 --> 30:46.330
Good.

30:47.050 --> 30:48.927
-Hungry?
-Uh, sure. Why not?

30:50.090 --> 30:52.342
Are you out of your mind? No.

30:53.050 --> 30:54.347
Dude, listen.

30:54.970 --> 30:57.803
-You know my body's a temple, right?
-I don't think about your body.

30:58.600 --> 31:01.342
What I mean is you know how healthy I am.

31:01.600 --> 31:04.398
-You're an athlete.
-Yeah, and a damn good one.

31:05.190 --> 31:07.146
But on the rare occasion,
when I want a deep,

31:07.240 --> 31:10.448
lovely night with my lady,
we'll do a little love drug.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.901
I've read that that_shit
can fry your brain,

31:12.990 --> 31:14.196
like, first time you try it.

31:14.410 --> 31:16.617
And riding your bike without a helmet
can kill you.

31:17.370 --> 31:19.907
But which one's gonna help you let loose

31:20.000 --> 31:23.128
and help you get past your shit
with Hannah and into each other?

31:24.420 --> 31:25.956
_ _ -Hmm?
-Th|s IS peer pressure.

31:26.340 --> 31:28.752
No, no. I don't wanna pressure you.

31:30.010 --> 31:31.546
You put too much pressure on yourself.

31:32.090 --> 31:34.138
I mean... that's the whole point.

31:35.260 --> 31:37.216
You agonize over every decision.

31:39.980 --> 31:40.799
I do not.

31:43.610 --> 31:44.508
Are you sure?

31:45.650 --> 31:49.188
I mean, we don't know where these drugs
come from, or even what drugs they are.

31:49.820 --> 31:52.778
The way you say "drugs" makes you sound
like a Republican senator.

31:53.700 --> 31:54.985
I'm just saying, we don't...

31:56.580 --> 31:57.615
we don't have to do this.

31:58.790 --> 32:02.453
You know, we can go hang out
somewhere else, or...

32:05.210 --> 32:07.792
Sure. I mean, if you want to. But...

32:09.590 --> 32:10.625
aren't you curious?

32:11.340 --> 32:12.500
[Alex] I'm telling you, Clay.

32:12.840 --> 32:14.216
It's a very good idea for you.

32:16.470 --> 32:17.300
Water?

32:18.180 --> 32:20.262
Guys, what if we just ate
a bunch of sugar and caffeine?

32:20.350 --> 32:23.979
-That's a certain kind of high, right?
-Seriously, do not worry.

32:24.940 --> 32:26.680
All right. Here you go.

32:26.940 --> 32:28.771
Three first-timers,

32:29.570 --> 32:30.480
three veterans.

32:31.360 --> 32:32.486
We got you guys.

32:34.070 --> 32:34.900
Totally.

32:36.740 --> 32:39.948
This is so peer pressure.
Like, at its worst.

32:53.260 --> 32:55.387
[video machine beeping]

32:55.720 --> 32:58.291
Uh, so tell me the truth.
How's he doing, guys?

32:58.810 --> 32:59.879
-He's good.
-Yeah?

32:59.970 --> 33:02.347
His balance is getting better
and so is his strength.

33:02.640 --> 33:04.767
I mean, he's still working
on his memory, but...

33:04.850 --> 33:06.090
But he's doing great.

33:06.770 --> 33:09.603
[Deputy Standall] You only need one hand
to whoop your old man at Skee-Ball.

33:09.730 --> 33:11.311
-[Peter] Hey.
-Yep.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.641
You should've challenged me
at Dance Dance Revolution.

33:15.990 --> 33:18.868
It's my birthday.
You're supposed to laugh at my jokes.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.860
[Mrs. Standall] All right. Wings.

33:21.040 --> 33:21.938
Yeah.

33:22.040 --> 33:25.248
-Fries. And curly fries.
-All right.

33:25.330 --> 33:27.537
-Burgers will come up when they're ready.
-Thanks, Mom.

33:27.630 --> 33:28.449
Thank you.

33:28.540 --> 33:29.780
You got all your game cards?

33:29.880 --> 33:31.745
Yeah. Yeah, thank you, Mrs. Standall.

33:34.300 --> 33:35.289
[Zach] Hey. Jess.

33:38.220 --> 33:39.596
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Yeah?

33:39.680 --> 33:41.420
He can go. He's good.

33:51.230 --> 33:52.060
Hey.

33:52.940 --> 33:57.525
I won this for you
just to say sorry about today.

33:58.990 --> 34:00.230
You didn't have to do that.

34:00.580 --> 34:02.980
Yeah, well, if I hadn't won it,
I'd just be saying sorry,

34:03.080 --> 34:05.867
and I thought
maybe the cuteness would help.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.916
Look, we don't need to talk about it.

34:11.460 --> 34:12.290
[Jessica] Hey.

34:14.050 --> 34:16.917
-[Mrs. Standall] Hi, sweetie. How are you?
-[Deputy Standall] Great to see you.

34:18.550 --> 34:19.585
[Jessica] Hi. How are you?

34:19.680 --> 34:21.841
-[all laughing]
-I just think it's complicated.

34:21.930 --> 34:24.057
See, the thing is to be in the group,

34:24.390 --> 34:26.881
but not about the group,
you know whatI mean?

34:27.190 --> 34:30.262
-No. What do you mean?
-All right. Take Alex.

34:30.610 --> 34:34.353
[laughs] You're friends with Justin Foley.

34:34.980 --> 34:36.686
[laughs] Which is, like, whatever.

34:41.200 --> 34:43.828
He doesn't. It's 'cause he's a dick.

34:44.040 --> 34:46.110
[laughter]

34:46.500 --> 34:50.413
I just feel, like, tremendous positivity
for everyone right now.

34:51.880 --> 34:53.450
Mmm. Exactly.

34:54.670 --> 34:56.877
In fact, I think it's time
that a few of us

34:56.960 --> 34:59.258
actually slip off for a while.

34:59.340 --> 35:01.001
-Sound good?
-Totally.

35:04.680 --> 35:06.056
[Jeff] Enjoy your night.

35:07.060 --> 35:08.766
It's already a great night.

35:09.600 --> 35:12.228
I agree. [chuckles]

35:12.310 --> 35:16.474
It's like... It's like everything
is what it is, but, like, more.

35:16.820 --> 35:19.983
-Like, touching... touching things.
-I know.

35:20.280 --> 35:22.157
[gasping]

35:29.910 --> 35:31.866
[arcade game noises continue]

35:38.300 --> 35:40.791
For someone who hates parties,
I go to a lot of parties.

35:42.800 --> 35:43.630
Yeah.

35:46.060 --> 35:47.266
And it never ends well.

35:49.350 --> 35:50.226
Nope.

35:54.270 --> 35:55.305
[sighs]

35:56.610 --> 35:57.645
What is he doing here?

35:58.610 --> 36:01.443
-No, Alex told me to come.
-Tyler, he was just being nice.

36:01.780 --> 36:03.020
He doesn't want you here.

36:03.490 --> 36:06.732
I wanna talk to Alex.
Okay, look, I brought him something.

36:07.030 --> 36:10.193
What? "Oh, happy birthday, Alex.
Here's a photo book of you in a coma"?

36:10.710 --> 36:12.166
He told you about that?

36:12.790 --> 36:15.122
Get out. Now.

36:23.180 --> 36:26.047
Wait. Where is Tyler going?

36:27.350 --> 36:30.092
-Don't worry. We got rid of him.
-No, I told him to come.

36:30.180 --> 36:32.842
Alex, look, I know he visited you a lot
in the hospital,

36:32.940 --> 36:35.431
-but he's a fucking pervert.
-After what he did to Hannah--

36:35.520 --> 36:37.226
[Clay] What he did? Seriously?

36:37.440 --> 36:39.601
At least Tyler tried
to help Hannah in court.

36:39.690 --> 36:42.818
That's more than you can say, Zach.
You helped turn her into Hannah the Slut.

36:42.900 --> 36:45.448
-At least we didn't do drugs.
-You guys, come on.

36:45.780 --> 36:47.236
You come on. You didn't help either.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.400
-I tried.
-From what you said today in court,

36:49.490 --> 36:50.866
you hurt her more than any of us.

36:51.200 --> 36:53.919
-They took that out of context.
-[Alex] So you didn't let her down?

36:54.170 --> 36:55.569
How are you any different than us?

37:00.170 --> 37:01.296
What are you thinking about?

37:03.050 --> 37:04.460
What are you thinking about?

37:04.550 --> 37:06.461
Come on, tell me.
What are you thinking about?

37:06.550 --> 37:09.007
-I... I don't know.
-[upbeat guitar song playing]

37:09.470 --> 37:10.880
You're not saying.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.056
I have...

37:14.850 --> 37:16.647
so many thoughts.

37:17.230 --> 37:18.219
Give me one.

37:24.360 --> 37:27.523
[groaning]

37:27.620 --> 37:28.769
[chuckles]

37:33.830 --> 37:34.990
Infinity.

37:36.620 --> 37:38.417
It's an infinity ceiling?

37:38.500 --> 37:41.128
No. It totally is. Look at it.

37:51.510 --> 37:52.590
Infinity.

37:55.270 --> 37:57.511
It's funny how we have a word
for that concept,

37:57.600 --> 38:00.012
but there's no way we can understand it.

38:02.530 --> 38:03.599
Maybe love.

38:06.030 --> 38:07.145
Love?

38:07.910 --> 38:10.822
Maybe love is how you understand infinity.

38:11.910 --> 38:14.652
When your love has no limits,
when it goes on forever.

38:15.080 --> 38:17.241
Maybe that feels like infinity.

38:23.380 --> 38:24.199
Huh.

38:26.840 --> 38:27.829
Yeah, maybe.

38:34.220 --> 38:35.426
How are you feeling?

38:35.600 --> 38:38.842
[chuckles] I feel fucking great.

38:38.940 --> 38:40.805
[both laugh]

38:40.900 --> 38:43.812
At this moment,
I am not afraid of anything.

38:43.900 --> 38:46.232
-I am fearless.
-Yeah.

38:49.450 --> 38:50.269
Ifeel...

38:52.120 --> 38:53.405
peaceful.

38:55.830 --> 38:59.118
-But it's just the drug, right?
-Is it?

39:02.540 --> 39:03.700
for the drug to find them?

39:05.500 --> 39:07.127
I'm not sure that's how it works.

39:09.180 --> 39:10.545
Do you believe we have a soul?

39:12.760 --> 39:14.170
I don't know. I hope so.

39:15.770 --> 39:18.421
If you could see the future,
would you wanna see the future?

39:19.770 --> 39:20.589
No.

39:21.400 --> 39:24.267
-You answered that fast.
-[chuckles] Well...

39:25.520 --> 39:27.602
Like, can I change the future?

39:28.900 --> 39:32.313
Because if I can see it
and I know what's coming,

39:32.410 --> 39:35.789
and there's nothing I can do about it,
then it's just anxiety.

39:35.870 --> 39:37.906
You can always change the future.

39:39.830 --> 39:41.536
So you don't believe in destiny?

39:42.380 --> 39:44.871
I do. I just believe it can change.

40:00.230 --> 40:02.346
This is the saddest birthday party ever.

40:03.310 --> 40:05.642
[cell phone ringing, vibrating]

40:07.400 --> 40:09.140
Shit. Uh, I gotta take this.

40:11.240 --> 40:13.606
Hey, Mom.
Yeah, no, I'm just out with the guys.

40:16.080 --> 40:19.243
I'll be home soon.
Yeah. No, I know, I know.

40:21.370 --> 40:22.200
[sighs]

40:22.290 --> 40:25.248
Okay. Yeah, I'm on my way. Bye.

40:28.710 --> 40:29.665
"The guys"?

40:31.050 --> 40:32.210
You're out with the guys?

40:32.840 --> 40:34.580
I just told her I'd go home and watch May.

40:34.680 --> 40:35.544
Home from what?

40:35.970 --> 40:37.380
Why'd you lie about where you are?

40:38.010 --> 40:38.920
I wasn't sure--

40:39.100 --> 40:41.011
Of course you should lie to her
and everybody

40:41.100 --> 40:43.261
'cause that's better than admitting
you're my friend?

40:43.350 --> 40:45.398
-She knows you're my friend.
-Bryce know where you are?

40:45.480 --> 40:47.016
-Come on, man.
-Fuck you, Zach.

40:47.110 --> 40:48.316
-Okay.
-Go home.

40:50.230 --> 40:52.232
Yeah, I should. Um...

40:53.070 --> 40:55.903
-Thank you guys for having me.
-[Deputy Standall] You don't have to go.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.440
I'm gonna go play some games.

41:07.630 --> 41:10.201
All right, you guys, truth now.

41:16.680 --> 41:19.638

41:19.720 --> 41:21.176
Bullshit. You said he made progress.

41:21.270 --> 41:23.261
He hasn't made any
since the day I saw him last.

41:23.350 --> 41:24.886
-A month ago.
-[Mrs. Standall] He's trying.

41:24.980 --> 41:26.186

-Just playing a game, Dad.

41:42.910 --> 41:45.208
Okay, maybe this isn't the right game
to be playing now.

41:45.290 --> 41:47.360
Why not? I'm really good at it.

41:48.460 --> 41:50.166

-Fuck, no.

Fuck, no!

42:09.400 --> 42:12.142
-All right, buddy, I'm sorry. Come here.
-Fucking let me go!

42:14.570 --> 42:16.731
I'm broken, okay?

42:21.240 --> 42:22.537
I'm fucking broken.

42:22.870 --> 42:25.407
That's how it's gonna be.
Why don't you just live with it?

-Alex, you're not broken.
-How the fuck would you know?

I've seen you twice
since I got out of the hospital.

42:30.880 --> 42:33.371
-I had school.
-I had fucking school, too!

42:35.260 --> 42:36.579
And I had friends.

-Stop.

Wouldn't that be better?

42:53.020 --> 42:55.102
You could get on
with your stupid fucking lives.

42:55.190 --> 42:57.852
Fuck you, Alex. Okay? Shut up.
Just shut up.

42:57.950 --> 42:58.848
-Jess.
-No.

42:58.950 --> 43:00.690
Listen to me, you asshole.

43:00.990 --> 43:02.230
How could you do what you did?

43:02.450 --> 43:05.328
After Hannah, I needed you.

43:05.580 --> 43:08.242
You were the only one I could trust,
who understood

43:08.330 --> 43:11.128
what I was going through, and you
were gonna fucking leave me behind?

43:11.460 --> 43:15.044
-That's messed up, Alex. It's messed up.
-I'm sorry.

43:16.510 --> 43:18.660
Everybody here loves you.

Sounds right.

I'm introducing my old man
to the wizarding world of Harry Potter.

-Seriously.

Hey.

Pay attention here. You're gonna need
to know that for the sixth movie.

Hey, so, uh...

44:16.020 --> 44:17.180
I wanna do Zach next.

Okay. Again?

44:20.280 --> 44:22.942
Yeah. He's just a fucking asshole
who needs to be checked.

44:25.370 --> 44:27.611
-Cool.
-Yeah. So I have this whole idea for him.

44:27.700 --> 44:29.998
-So I'm thinking--
-Ty, you know I'm down for whatever,

44:30.080 --> 44:33.072
but I got to make sure my dad
doesn't fall asleep.

44:33.170 --> 44:35.957
He's, like, 47.
They tend to do that during movies.

44:37.750 --> 44:38.660
Hey.

44:39.710 --> 44:41.211
Just tell me the plan. I'll be there.

44:41.300 --> 44:43.040
Yeah, fine. Later.

45:15.250 --> 45:17.377
[Sonya] Clay, isn't it true
that you heard Hannah say

45:17.460 --> 45:19.246
that she wanted her life to be over?

45:19.340 --> 45:21.160
And isn't it true that you did nothing?

45:22.550 --> 45:24.211
You did nothing to help her.

45:31.010 --> 45:32.978
If he had been honest with us
about the drugs--

45:33.060 --> 45:34.596
Did you know they were gonna ask?

45:35.640 --> 45:39.098
No, of course not. I removed myself, Matt.

45:39.900 --> 45:41.561
If I were to interfere with a witness--

45:41.650 --> 45:43.277
A witness? He's your son.

45:43.360 --> 45:47.399
If I were to interfere in any way,
I would be fired.

45:47.660 --> 45:49.116
I could be disbarred, Matt.

45:49.530 --> 45:50.986
Our boy did drugs, we didn't know.

45:51.080 --> 45:53.150
He hid a homeless boy for a week,
we didn't know.

45:53.250 --> 45:54.569
I mean, what the fuck, Lainie?

45:55.960 --> 45:58.576
-[Lainie] Trying to help a friend in need.
-Our son is in need.

45:58.670 --> 46:00.626
Yes, Matt, I'm aware.

46:01.000 --> 46:04.299
[Clay] I can't stop thinking about it,
Slqe. They destroyed me.

46:04.380 --> 46:05.870
Ask me why she was depressed.

46:06.130 --> 46:08.291
Why she was destroyed.
Ask me who did that to her.

46:08.390 --> 46:10.346
-[Sonya] No further questions.
-[judge] Jury will disregard.

46:10.430 --> 46:11.556

I will literally puke.

It's normal.

-Yeah, exactly.

what's the point of anything?

anymore"? Like, "I wanna die"?

Yep. Every single minute.

Okay? Get through this moment.

47:21.630 --> 47:22.995
And it'll all be clear.

and I couldn't help her today.

I care about the truth. I care about you.

and admit it

51:47.140 --> 51:49.381
and understand how fucked up it was.

in cleaning it up.
