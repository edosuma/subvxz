WEBVTT

00:08.792 --> 00:10.792
Okay, this one's from me.

00:10.875 --> 00:13.667
Oh. I told you guys, no gifts.

00:13.750 --> 00:15.041
Yeah, who ever believes that?

00:15.125 --> 00:16.458
Come on. Open it already, Bren.

00:16.542 --> 00:18.041
Alright, alright, alright.

00:19.166 --> 00:20.750
(all)
Aw!

00:20.834 --> 00:23.792
Oh, Dana, this is adorable.

00:23.875 --> 00:26.250
- I told you, you'd like
it.
- Oh!

00:26.333 --> 00:27.917
How can you tell
it's a girl, mommy?

00:28.000 --> 00:31.542
'Cause when I do this,
she sounds just like
you.

00:32.792 --> 00:34.750
Give me a hand, sweetie. C'mon.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.375
Time to pack it on, girls.

00:43.458 --> 00:45.792
Oh, and I'm supposed
to be dieting.

00:45.875 --> 00:48.917
Oh, one of the few good
perks of being this huge

00:49.000 --> 00:50.250
is you can eat
like a horse.

00:51.542 --> 00:53.291
Bring it on!

00:53.375 --> 00:54.375
Right here.

00:54.458 --> 00:55.333
Dana.

00:55.417 --> 00:57.166
Hey. No boys allowed.

00:57.250 --> 00:59.458
I told you this was
a girls' party, babe.

01:02.375 --> 01:04.792
From the National Guard.

01:04.875 --> 01:06.709
Oh, my God.

01:07.917 --> 01:10.041
I'm being deployed?

01:10.125 --> 01:11.000
Yeah.

01:13.333 --> 01:15.458
But you have a kid.

01:16.458 --> 01:17.583
How soon?

01:17.667 --> 01:20.625
Uh, three weeks.

01:20.709 --> 01:22.166
Who's going to take
care of Lindsey?

01:22.250 --> 01:24.291
I will, baby.

01:27.250 --> 01:30.542
[chuckles]
Hey...I'm a baker.

01:30.625 --> 01:33.500
Probably get stationed in
one of Saddam's old palaces

01:33.583 --> 01:35.834
<i>filets</i>
for the generals.

01:35.917 --> 01:37.041
'Right.'

01:37.917 --> 01:39.625
Well, here. I'll slice the tart.

01:39.709 --> 01:41.208
Here, honey.

01:41.291 --> 01:43.208
You're going away, mommy?

01:43.291 --> 01:45.500
I'll be back
before you know
it.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.542
In no time at all.

02:50.208 --> 02:52.250
That Veronica in the car?

02:52.333 --> 02:54.792
We're on our
way to
school.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.166
She's pouting because I
won't let her come with.

02:57.250 --> 02:58.667
[chuckles]
Eight-year-old

02:58.750 --> 03:00.208
wants to see a crime scene?

03:00.291 --> 03:02.917
She's a weird kid.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.500
- Hey, boss.
- Morning.

03:04.583 --> 03:06.750
- We got a floater?
- Not exactly.

03:06.834 --> 03:10.959
Marine Unit was doing a trawl
of the Delaware, turned this
up.

03:16.583 --> 03:18.750
Is that an arm?

03:18.834 --> 03:20.917
Ran the serial number,
matches the prosthetic

03:21.000 --> 03:23.583
of a missing Iraq War veteran.

03:23.667 --> 03:25.417
Guy couldn't catch a break, huh?

03:25.500 --> 03:28.125
Gal. Dana Taylor.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.709
Went missing three months after
returning from the Middle East.

03:30.792 --> 03:33.458
How long could someone
with a missing arm stay lost?

03:33.542 --> 03:35.750
You ever see
"The
Fugitive?"

03:35.834 --> 03:40.125
These things don't come cheap.
It's a custom fit, titanium.

03:40.208 --> 03:42.917
- Not something you'd just
toss.
- Not on purpose.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.291
So where'd
the rest of her
go?

03:44.375 --> 03:45.458
Well, if the arm
was in the river

03:45.542 --> 03:47.542
odds are the body is too.

03:47.625 --> 03:50.291
Divers are coming out.

03:50.375 --> 03:52.583
Not really a Bring Your
Daughter to Work Day.

04:29.333 --> 04:32.000
- Lady soldier, huh?
- Yup.

04:32.083 --> 04:34.500
- Got to wonder.
- Wonder what?

04:34.583 --> 04:38.041
Remember the girl in
Iraq,
had that guy on a leash?

04:38.125 --> 04:39.083
Yeah.

04:41.333 --> 04:42.250
What's your point?

04:42.333 --> 04:43.625
I just don't get these chicks

04:43.709 --> 04:44.834
that want to tote
guns
and take prisoners

04:44.917 --> 04:47.959
for a
living.
No
offense.

04:48.041 --> 04:49.500
(Will)
'Dana Taylor, 30.'

04:49.583 --> 04:52.583
Three months in Iraq.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.083
Hmm.

04:54.166 --> 04:56.208
Joined the Guard to
pay for cooking school.

04:56.291 --> 04:58.208
Seven and a half years
into an eight-year bid.

04:58.291 --> 05:00.500
Yeah. Probably never
thought she'd get called
up.

05:00.583 --> 05:02.458
Lost her right arm
in a grenade attack

05:02.542 --> 05:04.375
on her truck
outside
Fallujah.

05:04.458 --> 05:06.125
Ribbon of Valor for heroism.

05:06.208 --> 05:08.208
Pulled another soldier
out of the wreckage.

05:08.291 --> 05:09.542
When did she get back?

05:09.625 --> 05:11.542
June 2004.

05:11.625 --> 05:13.417
Disappeared October
the same year.

05:13.500 --> 05:15.375
Last to see was
the husband, Geoff.

05:15.458 --> 05:17.959
Says she went for
a walk that night..

05:18.041 --> 05:19.500
...never came back.

05:19.583 --> 05:20.583
Lame story.

05:20.667 --> 05:22.625
Yeah, so lame
it could be
true.

05:22.709 --> 05:25.750
Though he and Dana were
going through a rough
patch.

05:25.834 --> 05:27.917
So maybe she took a header
into the river on her own?

05:28.000 --> 05:31.125
Or maybe the husband
pulled a Scott Peterson.

05:31.208 --> 05:32.583
Hmm.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.333
Valens upstairs?

05:34.417 --> 05:37.917
Taking lost
time.
Didn't say why.

05:56.709 --> 05:57.834
Uncle Scotty's here!

05:57.917 --> 05:59.250
[laughing]
What's up?

05:59.333 --> 06:00.500
How you doing, Em?

06:00.583 --> 06:01.834
Oh, you're so big.

06:01.917 --> 06:04.959
(Scotty)
Where's your mom and dad, huh?

06:05.041 --> 06:06.375
Hiya, Scotty.

06:06.458 --> 06:08.333
What? You run out of
corn flakes or something?

06:08.417 --> 06:11.500
I can't visit my own brother
without being abused, hmm?

06:13.500 --> 06:16.125
Orange juice was sour.
We had to throw it away.

06:16.208 --> 06:17.208
- No kidding.
- 'Yeah.'

06:17.291 --> 06:18.625
Enough with that, Emilio.

06:18.709 --> 06:19.583
Hey.

06:19.667 --> 06:21.375
- What's up?
- Hi, mommy.

06:21.458 --> 06:24.750
Uh, you know, maybe we
could take a walk, or..

06:24.834 --> 06:26.792
papi,

06:29.375 --> 06:31.583
I won't rough him
up too bad, hmm?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.417
So, something happen?

06:37.500 --> 06:38.834
Um..

06:40.542 --> 06:42.834
...you remember
Coach
Fitzpatrick?

06:44.625 --> 06:46.250
The boxing guy
who taught classes

06:46.333 --> 06:48.458
at the gym
around the way?

06:48.542 --> 06:50.208
Uh..

06:50.291 --> 06:53.208
...you know, he...
got picked up.

06:53.291 --> 06:56.291
- A lewd act with a minor.
- Oh.

06:56.375 --> 06:57.625
DA's really
gunning for him

06:57.709 --> 07:01.291
and he's got a long
list of...witnesses.

07:01.375 --> 07:03.500
Are you serious?

07:04.667 --> 07:06.875
You're on the list, Mikey.

07:08.834 --> 07:11.333
Th-that
don't
make sense.

07:11.417 --> 07:13.250
- No?
- No.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.625
But to put this guy away,
they're gonna need

07:14.709 --> 07:16.375
all the ammo
they can get.

07:16.458 --> 07:18.834
Hey, God bless
'em,
but I can't help.

07:21.458 --> 07:22.583
Okay.

07:24.834 --> 07:26.750
I just told 'em
I'd check with you.

07:26.834 --> 07:28.542
Told who?

07:29.875 --> 07:32.041
The people who got
it wrong, I guess.

07:43.500 --> 07:45.458
Dana never took off that arm.

07:45.542 --> 07:47.834
She wanted to be
as normal as possible.

07:47.917 --> 07:49.625
Like before.

07:49.709 --> 07:52.166
Before Iraq?

07:52.250 --> 07:53.458
She come home
different?

07:53.542 --> 07:56.250
If you had your arm
blown off, wouldn't you?

07:56.333 --> 07:58.083
Just asking
a question.

07:58.166 --> 08:00.625
Yes. She was different.

08:00.709 --> 08:01.875
When I came
back from Vietnam

08:01.959 --> 08:05.083
my wife and I had
some troubles adjusting.

08:05.166 --> 08:08.125
We were
working it
out..

08:08.208 --> 08:09.792
...till she walked
out
the door that
night

08:09.875 --> 08:11.375
and I became a widower.

08:11.458 --> 08:12.750
She happen to mention

08:12.834 --> 08:15.667
she was headed toward
the river that night?

08:15.750 --> 08:18.667
She used to go on
long walks alone.

08:18.750 --> 08:20.208
Never said
where she went.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.542
Any problems with
friends, neighbors?

08:22.625 --> 08:26.166
No way...Fishtown's
a military
neighborhood.

08:26.250 --> 08:28.166
Dana went over,
did her duty.

08:28.250 --> 08:29.709
People respected that.

08:30.667 --> 08:34.208
I hate to ask, but...suicide?

08:37.250 --> 08:40.458
I thought we were
finding our way
back.

08:40.542 --> 08:42.250
Maybe Dana couldn't make it.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.709
Like you said, she
came back
different.

08:45.959 --> 08:49.166
And it...threw me.

08:55.667 --> 08:57.750
(male #1)
'You know what I miss the
most?'

08:57.834 --> 08:59.000
Your leg?

08:59.083 --> 09:00.083
Ha ha ha.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.375
(Dana)
'Uh...the chow?'

09:03.458 --> 09:04.458
The danger.

09:08.792 --> 09:10.041
Geoff.

09:10.125 --> 09:12.291
- Hey, Linds!
- Mommy!

09:15.166 --> 09:18.250
They couldn't put
your arm back on?

09:20.041 --> 09:22.959
No, baby, they couldn't.

09:23.041 --> 09:25.542
It's okay.
Give your mom a hug.

09:25.625 --> 09:27.834
[whispers]
Come here.

09:27.917 --> 09:30.750
Oh. We're all going
to get used to it.

09:30.834 --> 09:32.417
Yeah, sure.

09:34.458 --> 09:35.417
I don't like it.

09:35.500 --> 09:37.458
- It's weird.
- Lindsey!

09:37.542 --> 09:39.458
Hey, it's just an arm, okay?

09:39.542 --> 09:41.125
- I got another one.
- Okay.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.917
I'm so glad
to be back.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.083
We're glad too.

09:49.917 --> 09:51.667
Hey, Tommy.

09:51.750 --> 09:53.083
Neighborhood's
been pretty sleepy

09:53.166 --> 09:55.333
'without you
around raising some.'

09:55.417 --> 09:57.542
Been busy
kicking Iraqi ass.

09:57.625 --> 09:58.875
(Geoff)
'Whoa, Tommy.'

09:59.583 --> 10:00.834
(Tommy)
Sorry.

10:00.917 --> 10:02.583
You...forget.

10:02.667 --> 10:03.709
It's okay.

10:06.583 --> 10:08.000
(Lindsey)
'When are you coming home?'

10:08.083 --> 10:09.250
(Dana)
'In a week.'

10:09.333 --> 10:11.125
'I'll have
a prosthetic by then.'

10:11.208 --> 10:12.166
Be 100%.

10:15.375 --> 10:17.500
Well, 90%.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.542
I couldn't look at her.

10:27.625 --> 10:29.000
And she knew it.

10:29.083 --> 10:30.875
So, maybe that
hurt enough..

10:30.959 --> 10:32.417
...she put herself
in the river.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.291
The person who'd
know better than me?

10:35.375 --> 10:36.458
Tommy.

10:36.542 --> 10:38.083
Tommy from the hospital?

10:38.166 --> 10:40.542
Yeah, he was just a guy we
knew from the neighborhood

10:40.625 --> 10:41.917
but after what they went through

10:42.000 --> 10:45.166
he was...her new best friend.

10:45.250 --> 10:47.417
Was he in
the RPG attack
too?

10:47.500 --> 10:49.583
He was the one she saved.

10:49.667 --> 10:53.208
If Dana had any secrets,
it's Tommy who'd know 'em.

10:59.250 --> 11:04.208
Me and Dana fought in Iraq,
93 days and nights.

11:04.291 --> 11:05.709
Brings you
together,
huh?

11:05.792 --> 11:07.792
In a way you can't understand.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.250
Her cell phone records show
a lot of calls to you, Tommy

11:10.333 --> 11:12.125
after you both got back.

11:12.208 --> 11:14.375
Includes the
night
she disappeared.

11:14.458 --> 11:17.166
Uh, it's 'cause we
talked every night.

11:17.250 --> 11:19.083
It's not
what you
think.

11:19.166 --> 11:21.375
We talked about the war, rehab.

11:21.458 --> 11:22.750
Frank.

11:22.834 --> 11:24.750
Who's Frank?

11:24.834 --> 11:26.458
Our friend.

11:26.542 --> 11:28.625
Died in the attack.

11:28.709 --> 11:31.250
That you and Dana survived?

11:31.333 --> 11:34.583
What'd you talk about
the night she
disappeared?

11:34.667 --> 11:35.917
Well, the usual.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.083
Night terrors.

11:37.166 --> 11:39.291
Seeing Frank in our dreams.

11:39.375 --> 11:41.709
How the thanks you get for
fighting is people back here

11:41.792 --> 11:44.125
looking at you
like you're a freak.

11:44.208 --> 11:45.667
Sounds hard
to live
with.

11:45.750 --> 11:50.417
No one else gets it,
so we'd...tell each other.

11:57.625 --> 11:59.083
I wrote the Guard.

11:59.166 --> 12:00.166
Yeah?

12:00.250 --> 12:02.375
Asked them to
send me back over.

12:03.834 --> 12:04.792
You're kidding.

12:04.875 --> 12:07.083
Nope. I'm walking
good as new.

12:07.166 --> 12:08.333
Why not?

12:13.709 --> 12:14.792
You okay?

12:14.875 --> 12:16.458
Yeah.

12:16.542 --> 12:18.000
It was just..

12:23.208 --> 12:25.750
Oh, Dana, they're precious.

12:25.834 --> 12:27.458
You know, it's the best
I can do at the moment.

12:27.542 --> 12:29.250
Oh, they're sweet.

12:30.834 --> 12:33.500
- Brenda?
- No.

12:39.417 --> 12:41.500
Look at that face.

12:43.250 --> 12:45.500
I see Frank every
time I look at her.

12:46.792 --> 12:48.917
Missed you at his memorial.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.125
I heard it was beautiful.

12:53.875 --> 12:56.375
'Out on the bridge.'

12:56.458 --> 12:58.500
I guess you had
something better to do?

12:58.583 --> 12:59.875
I didn't think
you wanted me there.

12:59.959 --> 13:01.709
Oh, you got that right.

13:01.792 --> 13:03.083
(Dana)
'So what should I have done?'

13:03.166 --> 13:04.875
Just don't act
like we're friends.

13:04.959 --> 13:06.667
We're not.

13:06.750 --> 13:08.333
'And we never will be again.'

13:08.417 --> 13:11.041
- Brenda, you've had a few--
- You blew it off too, Tommy.

13:11.125 --> 13:12.333
So you just save it!

13:12.417 --> 13:14.125
- It's hard on us too.
- 'Oh, boo-hoo!'

13:14.208 --> 13:16.083
You didn't lose anyone.

13:16.166 --> 13:18.166
We lost Frank.

13:18.250 --> 13:20.667
You don't have
a baby with no father.

13:21.625 --> 13:24.125
I can't stand to see you alive

13:24.208 --> 13:27.542
when he is nothing but ashes
at the bottom of that river.

13:37.709 --> 13:40.083
Why was Brenda
laying this on Dana?

13:42.041 --> 13:45.125
Dana was driving
the truck when..

13:46.500 --> 13:49.375
So she blames her
for her husband
dying?

13:49.458 --> 13:51.542
But Brenda wasn't
in her right mind.

13:51.625 --> 13:53.542
She was drinking
all the time and..

13:53.625 --> 13:56.083
..half crazy over losing Frank.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.834
Crazy enough
to kill someone?

14:10.959 --> 14:12.583
Crap!

14:16.250 --> 14:17.333
What, are you
trying
to smoke us out?

14:17.417 --> 14:18.417
A nudge would
have worked.

14:18.500 --> 14:20.041
I was trying
to make breakfast.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.417
Well, maybe I'll
take a rain
check.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.834
[chuckles]
In my family

14:23.917 --> 14:25.959
"cooked" pretty much
meant whatever was spinning

14:26.041 --> 14:28.709
under the heat lamp
at 7-11, so..

14:28.792 --> 14:30.250
So I guess this is it then.

14:32.291 --> 14:34.250
Go ahead, pack
your bags and leave.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.583
Yeah, it's been
nice knowing
you.

14:35.667 --> 14:36.917
Get the door on
your way out, huh?

14:37.000 --> 14:38.458
<i>Adios.</i>

14:38.542 --> 14:41.959
Cut and run.
You wouldn't be the first.

14:45.041 --> 14:47.458
Who left you, Lil?

14:47.542 --> 14:48.875
What?

14:51.542 --> 14:53.333
My dad.

14:53.417 --> 14:55.458
I was six.

14:55.542 --> 14:57.000
Yeah?

14:59.500 --> 15:01.667
I always thought
he'd come back.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.542
My high school graduation,
I'm sitting there..

15:06.625 --> 15:09.166
...looking for him
in the bleachers.

15:09.250 --> 15:11.709
- Did he show?
- What do you think?

15:13.041 --> 15:14.625
I'm sorry.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.583
Yeah.

15:20.500 --> 15:24.041
Like I said, you
wouldn't be the first.

15:24.125 --> 15:27.000
Yeah, well, you know,
maybe I'll stay..

15:27.083 --> 15:29.166
...see if I can't be the last.

15:39.917 --> 15:41.667
(John)
'We appreciate you
taking the time.'

15:41.750 --> 15:43.917
You said it was about Dana.

15:45.208 --> 15:46.417
Did you find her?

15:46.500 --> 15:48.125
(Scotty)
Her arm.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.625
We're thinking the rest
of her might be dead.

15:51.917 --> 15:53.792
Missed the sensitivity
training, did you?

15:53.875 --> 15:57.166
4th of July, 2004

15:57.250 --> 15:59.166
things got ugly
between you two.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.583
I was reeling
over Frank's death.

16:03.542 --> 16:05.875
Not for nothing, I was..

16:05.959 --> 16:07.875
...a few glasses
<i>Chablis.</i>

16:07.959 --> 16:09.375
That can fuel the fire.

16:09.458 --> 16:12.375
I was grieving, not homicidal.

16:14.125 --> 16:15.250
And I was at home with my

16:15.333 --> 16:17.458
six-month-old the night
she went missing.

16:17.542 --> 16:20.041
Well, a six-month-old
alibi

16:20.125 --> 16:22.291
How would killing Dana help me?

16:23.291 --> 16:24.750
'Wouldn't bring Frank back.'

16:24.834 --> 16:26.875
Well, murder ain't
logical like that.

16:26.959 --> 16:28.542
Look, I apologized to her.

16:28.625 --> 16:30.709
- After the hangover.
- 'Yeah.'

16:30.792 --> 16:33.000
Things got back
to normal for us again.

16:33.083 --> 16:35.875
Of course, going back
to normal not that easy.

16:37.250 --> 16:38.458
No.

16:42.333 --> 16:43.709
Like a lot of guys coming back

16:43.792 --> 16:46.041
it seemed like part of
Dana was stuck in Iraq.

16:54.208 --> 16:57.583
How come daddy's not
driving me to gymnastics?

16:57.667 --> 16:59.333
'Cause mommy's home now.

16:59.417 --> 17:01.750
And this was
always
our thing, right?

17:01.834 --> 17:04.250
Daddy always lets
me sit up front.

17:07.291 --> 17:09.792
Why don't you braid
Lucy's hair, huh?

17:13.458 --> 17:15.750
So I stopped drinking.

17:15.834 --> 17:17.542
Yeah?

17:17.625 --> 17:19.375
After the way
I talked to you..

17:19.458 --> 17:20.750
Oh, come on.

17:20.834 --> 17:22.500
It was understandable.

17:24.583 --> 17:26.959
I'm going to grief counseling..

17:28.375 --> 17:30.959
...to talk about Frank..

17:31.041 --> 17:32.250
'...missing him.'

17:32.333 --> 17:33.500
(Dana)
'Sure.'

17:33.583 --> 17:35.959
(Brenda)
'You thought about it?'

17:36.041 --> 17:37.667
Counseling?

17:37.750 --> 17:39.500
Me? For what?

17:39.583 --> 17:42.500
Geoff says you never even
talked about the attack.

17:44.166 --> 17:45.458
No.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.750
I'd like to know
what happened.

17:50.542 --> 17:52.667
We were driving.

17:52.750 --> 17:54.417
Like we are now.

17:58.750 --> 18:01.000
Orders are you keep on
moving, you never stop.

18:01.083 --> 18:04.166
- What was Frank doing?
- 'He was looking out.'

18:04.250 --> 18:06.083
You always have
to look out 'cause..

18:06.166 --> 18:09.250
...the one thing out of
place can be the thing that..

18:09.333 --> 18:11.291
The thing that what?

18:13.208 --> 18:14.291
[shouting]
Get off the street!

18:16.750 --> 18:18.250
Hey, lady, watch it, you freak.

18:18.333 --> 18:20.041
- What are you doing?
- Mommy, don't.

18:20.125 --> 18:22.417
Didn't you see me coming?
Are you a complete moron?

18:22.500 --> 18:25.250
- Dane, stop!
- What a total loser!

18:25.333 --> 18:27.000
What a freak!

18:32.917 --> 18:34.500
I'm sorry.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.166
I keep forgetting I
can't act like that here.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.458
It's okay, sweetie.

18:47.542 --> 18:48.917
She's always doing that

18:49.000 --> 18:51.583
making people mad.

18:53.917 --> 18:58.375
(Scotty)
From happy homemaker
to road-rage case.

18:58.458 --> 18:59.458
'It's quite a flip.'

18:59.542 --> 19:02.208
Combat vet, classic PTSD.

19:02.291 --> 19:05.792
I realized that day that
the Dana I knew was gone.

19:07.709 --> 19:10.000
I wonder who else
she went off on.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.375
Sounds like this daughter
could tell some tales.

19:16.291 --> 19:18.959
Do you know where my mom went?

19:19.041 --> 19:20.834
We're trying to find out.

19:20.917 --> 19:22.625
That's why we're here.

19:22.709 --> 19:25.208
Do you remember when she came
back from the war, Lindsey?

19:25.291 --> 19:27.083
Yeah, she didn't have an arm.

19:27.166 --> 19:31.166
We heard she'd get upset
sometimes, make people mad.

19:31.250 --> 19:32.583
Yeah.

19:32.667 --> 19:35.375
Do you remember
any of those
people?

19:35.458 --> 19:36.750
No.

19:38.333 --> 19:40.625
You won't get in
trouble if you tell
us.

19:44.542 --> 19:47.625
- Maybe one man.
- Okay.

19:47.709 --> 19:50.709
At my school assembly.
He sat behind my mom.

19:52.208 --> 19:56.917
In this time of unrest,
we honor our own war heroes

19:57.000 --> 20:01.250
who put themselves in
harm's way to keep you
safe.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.041
'There are currently a..'

20:03.125 --> 20:04.709
What's with you?

20:04.792 --> 20:08.417
My petition to go
back was rejected.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.792
- I got medically discharged.
- It was a long shot.

20:11.875 --> 20:15.125
- It was also my last shot.
- At what?

20:15.208 --> 20:17.333
I just..

20:17.417 --> 20:19.834
...got nothing. No one.

20:19.917 --> 20:23.917
(female #1)
'And our first speaker
is from the 24..'

20:24.000 --> 20:26.208
Here. Hold this for me.

20:26.291 --> 20:28.792
(female #1)
'...and her daughter
is in Ms. Connor's'

20:28.875 --> 20:30.875
third grade class.

20:30.959 --> 20:33.792
Please welcome
Lindsey Taylor's mom

20:33.875 --> 20:35.959
Corporal Dana Taylor.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.875
I was in Iraq for three months.

20:48.917 --> 20:51.500
I drove a supply truck.

20:51.583 --> 20:56.625
'I was scared going over,
but...was ready to do my
duty.'

20:58.542 --> 21:00.709
Then, this happened to me.

21:03.250 --> 21:05.750
Now I..

21:05.834 --> 21:08.583
...I have confused
feelings about the war.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.792
So instead of
giving you a speech

21:10.875 --> 21:13.041
maybe I'll just
take some questions.

21:16.250 --> 21:18.417
Did you ever waste anyone?

21:22.792 --> 21:24.875
No.

21:24.959 --> 21:27.208
But I watched my
good friend get
wasted.

21:27.291 --> 21:29.500
His name was Frank.

21:29.583 --> 21:33.375
One second, he was telling
a joke and in the next,
his..

21:33.458 --> 21:36.667
...his blood and his insides
were all over the truck..

21:36.750 --> 21:38.500
'...all over me.'

21:38.583 --> 21:40.875
It's not like
a video game or a movie.

21:42.917 --> 21:45.125
It breaks your
heart right in half.

21:50.291 --> 21:55.375
(female #1)
Our next guest has been
in the Navy his entire
career.

21:56.792 --> 21:58.208
What kinda
soldier are you?

21:58.291 --> 22:00.000
The kind that tells the truth.

22:00.083 --> 22:01.917
I'm going back for my
second tour in a week.

22:02.000 --> 22:04.542
'How do you think
my kid feels now?'

22:04.625 --> 22:05.750
Maybe we should go, Linds.

22:05.834 --> 22:07.875
You should have stayed
in the damn kitchen.

22:07.959 --> 22:08.875
You know that?

22:08.959 --> 22:09.917
You got no business

22:10.000 --> 22:12.333
trying to do a man's job.

22:12.417 --> 22:14.500
I'm a soldier, same as you.

22:16.625 --> 22:21.208
(female #1)
His son Charlie is in
Mr. Levin's fifth grade
class.

22:21.291 --> 22:22.709
Someone ought to
teach you a lesson.

22:22.792 --> 22:25.709
(female #1)
'Please welcome
Lieutenant Jamal Ross.'

22:31.166 --> 22:32.917
Who was this man?

22:33.000 --> 22:35.166
Penny Kozlowski's dad.

22:36.333 --> 22:39.000
That helps
a lot,
Lindsey.

22:39.083 --> 22:41.542
Maybe my mom went
away 'cause of me.

22:43.208 --> 22:44.709
Why would she do that?

22:44.792 --> 22:46.041
'Cause maybe she found out

22:46.125 --> 22:48.750
I thought her arm was scary.

22:48.834 --> 22:50.291
(Lilly)
'You know what, Lindsey?'

22:50.375 --> 22:52.291
If you were my girl

22:52.375 --> 22:53.542
I'd be so proud.

22:53.625 --> 22:57.125
- You would?
- 'Yeah, because you're
brave.'

22:57.208 --> 22:59.917
I know your mom could
see that just like I can.

23:08.417 --> 23:09.625
Thanks a lot, sir.

23:13.542 --> 23:15.500
Sounds like this
Kozlowski
didn't like girls

23:15.583 --> 23:17.125
fighting his war.

23:17.208 --> 23:19.375
What say we
find out how much?

23:30.709 --> 23:34.083
Charles Kozlowski?

23:34.166 --> 23:36.333
- Who's asking?
- 'Philly Homicide.'

23:37.125 --> 23:38.375
It's about Dana Taylor.

23:38.458 --> 23:39.834
Homicide, huh?

23:39.917 --> 23:42.166
Not surprised, the mouth on her.

23:42.250 --> 23:43.583
We heard you
were a real fan

23:43.667 --> 23:45.834
of her speech at your
daughter's assembly.

23:45.917 --> 23:48.000
[chuckles]
GI Janes.

23:48.083 --> 23:49.750
Some jobs women just can't do.

23:49.834 --> 23:51.834
Not disagreeing,
but why go after Dana?

23:51.917 --> 23:54.417
'Cause that bitch traumatized
every kid in the place.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.125
So, maybe you retaliated.

23:56.208 --> 23:58.959
Aggravated assault does
seem to be your specialty.

23:59.041 --> 24:00.834
That Taylor broad
needed to be shut up.

24:00.917 --> 24:03.458
And if I was the one
who did it, I'd tell you.

24:03.542 --> 24:05.500
(Nick)
'All the same, we got to
verify'

24:05.583 --> 24:07.166
'your whereabouts
when she disappeared.'

24:07.250 --> 24:08.667
I keep great calendars.

24:08.750 --> 24:11.166
You tell me the date,
I'll tell you where I was.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.500
Deal.

24:21.458 --> 24:24.375
They say you're only supposed
to cut to the first five-leaf.

24:24.458 --> 24:26.500
Is that right?

24:26.583 --> 24:28.917
My grandma was
a green thumb.

24:29.000 --> 24:32.125
Always said that's how you
get double the bloom in
return.

24:32.208 --> 24:33.875
That's a good tip.

24:33.959 --> 24:36.542
Got any tips for me?

24:36.625 --> 24:39.625
You know your husband's
temper all too well, I bet.

24:40.625 --> 24:42.792
Got anything to add?

24:45.417 --> 24:47.709
- I knew that woman.
- Dana?

24:47.792 --> 24:50.542
- 'Well, I knew of her.'
- Meaning?

24:50.625 --> 24:51.709
I knew her husband.

24:54.750 --> 24:56.208
Paula, who's your friend?

24:56.291 --> 24:58.875
This is Geoff.
His wife Dana is a soldier.

24:58.959 --> 25:00.041
(all)
'Hi, Geoff.'

25:00.125 --> 25:01.166
Hi.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.875
(female #2)
'Welcome to our support
group.'

25:03.959 --> 25:06.000
Tell 'em about her.

25:08.166 --> 25:12.667
Dana? Well, uh...she's been
my girl since we were 15.

25:14.875 --> 25:17.834
We got a kid.

25:17.917 --> 25:21.041
Thank God 'cause that's all
I have to hang onto right
now.

25:21.125 --> 25:25.208
I mean, I'm not even
allowed to know where Dana is.

25:25.291 --> 25:29.041
Just that she's...
over there someplace.

25:30.875 --> 25:33.417
I worry all the time and..

25:37.083 --> 25:40.625
...I...I guess, just
feel kind of lost.

25:43.250 --> 25:45.125
Why don't we take
a coffee break?

25:53.834 --> 25:55.417
Helps to talk, right?

25:55.500 --> 25:57.250
- Feel like a fool.
- Why?

25:57.333 --> 25:59.250
'Cause I'm a man, Paula.

25:59.333 --> 26:02.125
Sitting around
expressing feelings..

26:05.959 --> 26:08.000
I know you're a man.

26:20.125 --> 26:22.959
So Geoff had a side dish.

26:23.041 --> 26:25.542
A lot of people have Jodies.

26:25.625 --> 26:26.542
"Jodies?"

26:26.625 --> 26:27.875
Someone to keep
company with

26:27.959 --> 26:29.834
till your soldier
comes home.

26:29.917 --> 26:32.083
Meaning it wasn't
serious between them?

26:32.166 --> 26:34.250
Well, except Paula's
husband kept re-upping

26:34.333 --> 26:36.375
so she was alone a lot.

26:36.458 --> 26:39.834
My opinion, she wanted
something real with Geoff.

26:39.917 --> 26:42.542
So his wife coming
home was a problem.

26:42.625 --> 26:45.000
And when Paula wants something

26:45.083 --> 26:47.709
she's pretty determined.

26:55.917 --> 26:58.250
Your husband's
overseas, Paula?

27:00.083 --> 27:01.959
Ass-deep in
the Sunni
Triangle.

27:02.041 --> 27:04.208
Not exactly a garden spot.

27:04.291 --> 27:05.625
Desert air must
appeal to him.

27:05.709 --> 27:07.875
He keeps re-enlisting.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.583
Hmm.

27:10.875 --> 27:12.667
Lonely nights?

27:12.750 --> 27:14.375
I keep busy.

27:14.458 --> 27:16.875
(Lilly)
Like with Geoff Taylor?

27:16.959 --> 27:19.000
Me and Geoff might
have had a thing.

27:19.083 --> 27:20.417
(Lilly)
'"A thing?"'

27:20.500 --> 27:21.875
Like an affair?

27:21.959 --> 27:25.333
No, we'd get
together
and do crosswords.

27:25.417 --> 27:28.041
And Dana being your friend,
didn't count for much.

27:28.125 --> 27:30.625
Wartime. Rules change.

27:30.709 --> 27:32.709
So you and Geoff
are hitting it

27:32.792 --> 27:34.500
then Dana comes home

27:34.583 --> 27:37.583
and he starts flying right.
You're out in the cold.

27:37.667 --> 27:40.834
Well, you know the old
saying
about the woman scorned.

27:40.917 --> 27:42.709
Except I wasn't.

27:44.333 --> 27:45.917
The affair kept going?

27:46.000 --> 27:48.834
Geoff was patient,
but a month after she came home

27:48.917 --> 27:50.750
Dana still wouldn't
let him touch her.

27:50.834 --> 27:53.250
So pretty soon,
he's back in your
arms.

27:54.083 --> 27:56.166
And then it all blew up.

27:58.625 --> 28:01.834
Button up already.
You got to get out of here.

28:01.917 --> 28:04.083
My house tomorrow?

28:05.834 --> 28:07.500
What are we
doing,
Paula?

28:07.583 --> 28:09.417
Living.

28:09.500 --> 28:10.750
Yeah.

28:10.834 --> 28:13.583
We could make it permanent.

28:13.667 --> 28:15.834
[sighs]
Sometimes I
think..

28:20.417 --> 28:21.750
What, baby?

28:21.834 --> 28:23.875
I get dark thoughts.

28:25.041 --> 28:27.166
About changing my life.

28:32.208 --> 28:34.709
- No.
- I-I thought you were at
rehab.

28:34.792 --> 28:35.875
Lindsey's school called.

28:35.959 --> 28:37.959
- She has a fever.
- Look, Dane--

28:38.041 --> 28:40.125
So I've been busting my ass
trying to learn how to brush

28:40.208 --> 28:41.959
my teeth again and this
is what you're doin'?

28:42.041 --> 28:44.333
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, me too.

28:44.417 --> 28:46.709
But, hey, let me make it
right.
I'll pack up and get lost.

28:46.792 --> 28:48.125
- Leave you to it.
- That's not gonna happen--

28:48.208 --> 28:49.709
I'll take Lindsey with
me, 'cause there's no way

28:49.792 --> 28:51.792
I'm letting this bitch set
an example for my little girl.

28:51.875 --> 28:53.000
Dana.

28:54.458 --> 28:56.875
I can't believe you
threw it all away.

29:04.542 --> 29:06.959
You probably think I'm
some bimbo home-wrecker.

29:08.208 --> 29:10.542
Pretty much.

29:10.625 --> 29:13.000
He was
lonely.
So was I.

29:13.083 --> 29:15.083
And then Dana
cleared the way for you.

29:15.166 --> 29:17.834
Once she busted us,
it was over.

29:17.917 --> 29:18.834
Over for her too.

29:18.917 --> 29:20.166
She disappeared that night

29:20.250 --> 29:22.542
leaving Geoff kind of...single.

29:22.625 --> 29:25.375
Like I said, that was
the end of him and me.

29:25.458 --> 29:28.417
But no worries, I've
got a new Jody now.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.000
Oh, congratulations.

29:31.083 --> 29:33.375
You can go, Paula.

29:33.458 --> 29:34.542
Hmm.

29:41.250 --> 29:44.458
Didn't Geoff say his little
girl
was all he had to hang onto?

29:46.041 --> 29:48.500
Yeah, if Dana was gonna
leave and take the kid..

29:48.583 --> 29:51.208
Maybe those dark thoughts
got the best of him.

30:06.875 --> 30:09.208
Didn't tell us
about
your girlfriend,
Geoff.

30:10.667 --> 30:12.375
Excuse me?

30:12.458 --> 30:14.166
The skank. Paula.

30:16.208 --> 30:17.959
Sounds like you
found out anyway.

30:18.041 --> 30:20.041
(Scotty)
'Didn't want to share
that piece of the puzzle?'

30:20.125 --> 30:22.000
- Would you?
- If a murder cop was asking?

30:22.083 --> 30:23.750
Yeah, I'd come clean.

30:23.834 --> 30:26.750
Ashamed enough of something,
you do a lot to hide it.

30:28.792 --> 30:32.917
Not to mention...it gives you
motive for offing your wife.

30:34.417 --> 30:36.917
I didn't kill Dana. I loved her.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.417
You loved your daughter too and
Dana wanted to take her away.

30:39.500 --> 30:42.709
Look...whatever punishment

30:42.792 --> 30:44.875
I had coming my way
I was gonna take it.

30:44.959 --> 30:46.709
But something good actually

30:46.792 --> 30:49.333
came out of all that crap.

30:49.417 --> 30:51.917
Oh, yeah? What?

30:52.000 --> 30:54.750
We finally talked about it.

30:54.834 --> 30:56.667
About?

30:56.750 --> 30:58.750
What happened over there.

30:59.834 --> 31:01.542
How's she doing?

31:01.625 --> 31:03.667
Fever's down.

31:04.834 --> 31:06.500
Helps her sleep.

31:06.583 --> 31:09.250
She always loved this.

31:09.333 --> 31:11.500
(Geoff)
'Still does.'

31:14.834 --> 31:17.458
You're going, huh?

31:37.792 --> 31:40.250
What happened, Dane?

31:40.333 --> 31:42.500
I don't know.

31:42.583 --> 31:44.959
It's like I lost
you over there.

31:47.083 --> 31:49.750
'I'm so sorry.'

31:49.834 --> 31:52.625
Look, I'll go if
that's what you
want.

31:53.542 --> 31:55.583
But first..

31:57.458 --> 31:59.583
...tell me..

31:59.667 --> 32:01.375
...what happened
over there

32:01.458 --> 32:03.667
'when you got hurt.'

32:06.792 --> 32:07.959
You don't wanna know.

32:08.041 --> 32:09.750
Yeah, I do.

32:09.834 --> 32:11.166
You'll hate me.

32:11.250 --> 32:13.166
I could never hate you.

32:14.250 --> 32:16.166
[sniffles]
That Ribbon of Valor

32:16.250 --> 32:18.291
I don't deserve it.

32:19.125 --> 32:21.083
'Why not?'

32:22.625 --> 32:23.667
[crying]
What happened
to Frank

32:23.750 --> 32:25.542
was my fault.

32:27.041 --> 32:29.500
How's that possible?

32:29.583 --> 32:31.917
We'd just made a delivery.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.875
We were driving back.

32:34.959 --> 32:37.250
Frank was telling
a stupid joke.

32:38.583 --> 32:41.500
And then suddenly, there
was something in the road.

32:41.583 --> 32:42.834
Someone.

32:42.917 --> 32:44.125
Who?

32:54.125 --> 32:56.750
A little girl.

32:56.834 --> 32:58.709
And they tell you

32:58.792 --> 32:59.834
you see anyone in the road

32:59.917 --> 33:01.875
you-you just run 'em down.

33:01.959 --> 33:03.166
Even a kid?

33:03.250 --> 33:06.333
They use the kids to
get the convoys to stop.

33:07.750 --> 33:09.041
I didn't see a trap

33:09.125 --> 33:10.667
I saw a little girl

33:10.750 --> 33:13.333
who could've been Lindsey,
so I slowed down

33:13.417 --> 33:15.542
and that's when we got hit.

33:18.250 --> 33:20.291
Dane. Dane.

33:23.166 --> 33:25.333
Typical girl soldier, right?

33:25.417 --> 33:27.250
That wasn't a girl thing.

33:27.333 --> 33:30.542
It was, it was a hu-human thing.

33:30.625 --> 33:32.709
I would've done the same.

33:34.417 --> 33:38.875
Baby, an RPG
killed Frank, not you.

33:47.333 --> 33:48.875
I don't want
that ribbon.

33:48.959 --> 33:51.834
It's keeping me in
a place I don't wanna be.

33:54.291 --> 33:55.542
So get rid of it.

33:55.625 --> 33:57.583
And Frank.

33:57.667 --> 34:00.709
- We gotta say goodbye to him.
- Okay.

34:00.792 --> 34:03.917
Can you stay with
Linds...
for a couple of hours?

34:04.041 --> 34:07.583
Sure. Of course.
I'll be right here.

34:07.667 --> 34:10.166
Yeah? Good.

34:10.250 --> 34:11.458
Dane?

34:15.458 --> 34:17.500
You're my girl.

34:26.333 --> 34:29.375
I was praying she'd come
home and wanna start over.

34:30.709 --> 34:33.667
'But she never made it back.'

34:33.750 --> 34:35.250
And you didn't go with her?

34:35.333 --> 34:36.750
No.

34:36.834 --> 34:38.792
So what did she mean by we?

34:38.875 --> 34:39.875
I don't know.

34:39.959 --> 34:41.542
I..

34:41.625 --> 34:42.959
...I always assumed

34:43.041 --> 34:45.917
she went on her walks alone.

34:46.041 --> 34:47.125
Tommy.

34:47.208 --> 34:48.792
He didn't go to
Frank's memorial
either.

34:48.875 --> 34:50.458
And he had
the Ribbon of Valor.

34:50.542 --> 34:52.000
So where would they
go to say goodbye?

34:52.083 --> 34:54.417
Frank's ashes were
in the river,
right?

35:06.000 --> 35:07.208
(Lilly)
'We know why Dana went out'

35:07.291 --> 35:09.333
'that night, Tommy.'

35:09.417 --> 35:12.709
- Oh, yeah?
- To ditch that Ribbon of
Valor.

35:12.792 --> 35:14.917
Put the war behind her.

35:15.000 --> 35:18.000
Any thoughts how she
might've done that?

35:18.083 --> 35:20.250
- Not really.
- Want my guess?

35:20.333 --> 35:21.417
She threw it
in the river.

35:21.500 --> 35:23.166
Where Dana
ended up
too.

35:23.250 --> 35:25.709
- Probably.
- Why are you telling me?

35:25.792 --> 35:27.291
(Lilly)
''Cause she called
you that night.'

35:27.375 --> 35:30.208
- Asked you to meet her.
- 'Bring the ribbon.'

35:30.291 --> 35:33.000
She knew you both needed
to lay Frank to rest.

35:34.250 --> 35:35.875
So what if that's true?

35:35.959 --> 35:37.458
(Lilly)
'Seems like something
you'd mention'

35:37.542 --> 35:40.667
unless something went
real wrong that night.

35:40.750 --> 35:43.709
What I don't
get?
Dana saved you.

35:43.792 --> 35:46.208
Pulled you
from that
truck.

35:46.291 --> 35:48.875
- Why would you wanna hurt her?
- I wouldn't.

35:48.959 --> 35:50.959
That is the last thing I'd want.

35:51.041 --> 35:52.208
Well, I believe you, Tommy

35:52.291 --> 35:54.208
'cause I think you
wanted more of her

35:54.291 --> 35:56.041
than you could have.

35:56.125 --> 35:57.542
What do you mean?

35:57.625 --> 35:59.542
Iraq. Rehab.

35:59.625 --> 36:02.375
All those late-night
calls when you got home.

36:03.291 --> 36:05.291
Brings you
together in a way

36:05.375 --> 36:08.208
other people
can't understand.

36:08.291 --> 36:11.458
Hard not to get attached
to someone after all that.

36:11.542 --> 36:12.667
But she was married.

36:12.750 --> 36:15.250
Geoff was messing
around on her.

36:15.333 --> 36:16.750
She told me that night.

36:16.834 --> 36:18.834
And you saw your opening.

36:23.834 --> 36:27.041
Well...seemed like
she felt the same.

36:28.500 --> 36:29.959
When we'd talk,
you know?

36:30.041 --> 36:33.083
got

36:33.166 --> 36:35.291
...and she got me.

36:39.583 --> 36:41.625
And no one else did.

36:43.291 --> 36:46.709
I thought it was gonna be
the start of a new life.

36:46.792 --> 36:49.583
Instead it was the end.

36:58.458 --> 36:59.750
What are you doing?

36:59.834 --> 37:02.625
Flirting with
danger again?

37:02.709 --> 37:04.875
River looks
beautiful from up
here.

37:05.667 --> 37:07.959
Yeah.

37:08.041 --> 37:10.125
Did you bring it?

37:13.083 --> 37:15.041
(Tommy)
'What are we going
to do with it?'

37:16.959 --> 37:18.583
Move on.

37:20.500 --> 37:22.792
This is about what was.

37:22.875 --> 37:25.333
Memories, right?

37:25.417 --> 37:27.291
I guess.

37:30.208 --> 37:32.417
It's time to leave 'em behind.

37:37.083 --> 37:38.834
Rest in peace, Frankie.

37:47.583 --> 37:49.500
New chapter, huh?

37:49.583 --> 37:50.875
Right.

37:55.375 --> 37:57.125
So how about
you and me?

37:58.625 --> 37:59.750
You and me?

37:59.834 --> 38:02.959
There's a reason we
talk every night, Dane.

38:03.041 --> 38:04.750
Why we never
wanna hang up.

38:06.500 --> 38:07.834
Tommy..

38:07.917 --> 38:10.208
...we went through a lot.

38:10.291 --> 38:12.792
And now it's
part
of our lives.

38:12.875 --> 38:14.208
I have a family. I can't--

38:14.291 --> 38:15.709
He cheated on you.

38:15.792 --> 38:17.083
I know.

38:17.166 --> 38:18.875
And maybe, we'll never
recover from that

38:18.959 --> 38:20.959
but we're gonna try.

38:24.875 --> 38:26.417
When I'm standing
right here?

38:26.500 --> 38:30.166
Tommy, we almost
died together.

38:30.250 --> 38:32.208
Of course, that
brought us
close.

38:32.291 --> 38:33.417
I got nothin' else, Dane.

38:33.500 --> 38:36.208
You got me. As your friend.

38:36.291 --> 38:37.500
No. That's not enough.

38:37.583 --> 38:39.875
We're vets. That's special.

38:39.959 --> 38:41.458
Oh, bull.

38:41.542 --> 38:44.125
That's nothing.

38:44.208 --> 38:48.000
I can't...hold on to that.

38:48.083 --> 38:51.417
We're finding our
way back, Tommy.

38:51.500 --> 38:54.041
And we're gonna make it.

38:54.125 --> 38:56.208
You will.

38:56.291 --> 38:58.542
Not me.

38:58.625 --> 39:00.667
- Not me!
- Ah!

39:00.750 --> 39:02.208
- Ah!
- No!

39:02.291 --> 39:03.333
(Tommy)
'No!'

39:06.166 --> 39:07.625
No!

39:07.709 --> 39:08.917
Dana!

39:09.542 --> 39:10.709
No!

39:14.000 --> 39:15.667
Dana, no!

39:17.333 --> 39:18.417
Dana!
