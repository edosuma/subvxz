11:52.799 --> 11:54.299
Thanks for sticking this out.

11:54.333 --> 11:56.335
Reporter: <i>...Have rallied around</i>
<i>one longtime neighbor</i>

11:59.072 --> 12:00.706
<i>Tell us your feelings, sir.</i>

12:00.740 --> 12:03.242
Homeowner: Good people are being
forced out of their homes

12:03.276 --> 12:06.412

to begin with... the banks.

12:06.446 --> 12:10.282
Actually, I'm gonna go home.

Homeowner: <i>They're the ones who
broke their promises to us.</i>

12:13.619 --> 12:16.521
<i>Now me and my family,</i>
<i>we're homeless.</i>

12:16.555 --> 12:18.690

<i>Who's looking out for us?</i>

12:23.262 --> 12:25.830
<i>( Birds chirping )</i>

12:25.865 --> 12:29.134
Tina, we have to focus
on the campaign.

12:29.168 --> 12:31.070
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

12:31.104 --> 12:33.906
You're being incredibly
petty right now.

12:33.940 --> 12:35.474
<i>Uh, we'll talk</i>
<i>about this later.</i>

12:35.509 --> 12:37.977
Kitty's here.

12:38.011 --> 12:40.946
- Morning.
- First time in four campaigns

12:40.981 --> 12:43.949
Cook County is oh-so-possibly
ours for the taking.

12:43.983 --> 12:48.086
My longtime staffers don't know
what to do with themselves.

12:49.189 --> 12:51.190
Tina's upset
because I wanna move

12:51.224 --> 12:53.726
my headquarters to Chicago

12:53.760 --> 12:56.361
with you at the helm.

12:56.396 --> 12:57.896
Oh.

12:58.898 --> 13:01.266
Are you game?

13:02.051 --> 13:03.669
Of course.

13:04.203 --> 13:05.537
Good.

13:05.572 --> 13:07.039
Just don't get used to it.

13:07.073 --> 13:09.975
Soon enough, I'll have you
with me in Springfield.

13:12.746 --> 13:14.480
This mass eviction thing
is turning ugly.

13:14.514 --> 13:16.082
Do you want me
to head over there?

13:16.116 --> 13:18.017
Chuck, why did no one,
including myself,

13:18.052 --> 13:20.086
uncover the fact that
right beneath our eyes

13:20.120 --> 13:21.988
a few months back
there was an internal plot

13:22.022 --> 13:23.957
to run Zajac
for mayor of Chicago

13:23.991 --> 13:25.759
instead of
governor of Illinois?

13:25.793 --> 13:28.628
A plot that might have come to pass
had he not been caught on camera

13:28.662 --> 13:30.963
screwing the wife
of the man who hatched it,

13:30.998 --> 13:32.532
i.e. Alderman Ross.

13:32.566 --> 13:36.035
I mean, how come Kane can crack
that story, but we can't?

13:36.069 --> 13:40.339
Um, there have been six arrests
made at Lennox Gardens.

13:41.341 --> 13:42.808
Well, what are you waiting for?

13:42.842 --> 13:44.576
Get out there.

13:48.547 --> 13:51.749
Ezra: <i>This is just a fantasy.
I'm still here.</i>

13:51.783 --> 13:53.584

<i>There's no remedy.</i>

13:53.618 --> 13:55.352

<i>A wish!</i>

- <i>I'm not going anywhere.</i>
- ( Volume increases )

13:59.825 --> 14:02.994
<i>I'm the only thing that makes sense!
A wish.</i>

<i>I'm the only one</i>
<i>who knows the truth.</i>

14:04.963 --> 14:06.497
- ( Tuning stations )
- <i>A distraction.</i>

14:06.532 --> 14:09.701

<i>There's only resistance.</i>

Reporter: <i>Here in the windy city
where indeed a storm is brewing</i>

14:12.705 --> 14:15.908

14:32.024 --> 14:34.125
"God forbid we should
ever be 20 years

14:34.160 --> 14:35.894
without such a rebellion."

14:38.431 --> 14:39.430
( Laughs )

14:39.431 --> 14:41.933
Thomas Jefferson.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.368
You have some
reading to do, son,

14:43.402 --> 14:45.338
if you really wanna make
a go in this business.

14:45.372 --> 14:47.407
You know when Lennox Gardens
last blew up?

14:49.243 --> 14:52.145
1993.
You do the math.

14:53.147 --> 14:55.381
- 19 years.
- One shy of 20.

14:55.416 --> 14:58.084
What might Jefferson
himself recommend

14:58.118 --> 14:59.886
for a course of action today?

15:00.170 --> 15:01.670
Rebellion?

15:01.705 --> 15:04.039
If you say so.

15:04.074 --> 15:08.010
You are a man with
influence in the community

15:08.044 --> 15:09.677
<i>with foot soldiers at the ready</i>

15:09.712 --> 15:12.914
<i>who surely know</i>
<i>how to disturb the peace.</i>

15:12.948 --> 15:14.716
You mean light shit up?

15:14.751 --> 15:16.719
"And the rockets' red glare,

15:16.753 --> 15:19.221
the bombs bursting in air"...

15:19.255 --> 15:20.722
I assume that means more to you

15:20.757 --> 15:22.791
than drunken sing-alongs
at a Sox game.

15:22.825 --> 15:25.393
Sir, I was just hoping to have

15:25.428 --> 15:28.063
a more legitimate role
in things.

15:28.097 --> 15:31.499
As Kenya Taylor's replacement,
for example?

15:32.501 --> 15:34.636
<i>Ward boss of the 21st?</i>

15:38.141 --> 15:40.242
Is something
happening in Chicago?

15:40.276 --> 15:42.477
- Ezra: <i>It's burning to the ground.</i>
- I'm afraid I don't know.

15:42.512 --> 15:45.447
- What's that?
- Ezra: <i>Poison. Don't take it.</i>

15:45.482 --> 15:47.349
It's just for contrast,
Mr. Kane.

15:47.383 --> 15:49.017
Gives us a better MRI scan.

15:49.051 --> 15:51.587
Ezra:
<i>Why would you want that?</i>

15:51.621 --> 15:55.291
<i>They might see then</i>
<i>what you really are,</i>

15:55.325 --> 15:57.092
<i>everything that</i>
<i>you've ever done.</i>

15:57.126 --> 16:00.861
<i>That wouldn't be</i>
<i>a good thing, Tom...</i>

16:03.331 --> 16:05.866
<i>Because you are a bad man.</i>

16:06.401 --> 16:08.569
<i>You can't change it, Tom.</i>

16:08.604 --> 16:11.606
<i>( Whispering continues</i>

<i>more than it hurts me.</i>

16:21.517 --> 16:23.185
<i>( Sirens wailing )</i>

16:23.186 --> 16:24.853
Letting things play out
might only make them worse.

16:24.887 --> 16:26.921
I'll show you
affirmative action...

16:26.956 --> 16:29.357
a goddamn wrecking ball
on that dump.

16:29.391 --> 16:30.792
After all I've given you...

16:30.826 --> 16:35.263
your career, this office,
my own daughter!

16:35.298 --> 16:38.033
Half my time is spent cleaning
up the mess you left behind!

16:38.067 --> 16:39.768
Fuck him!

<i>You remember, don't you.</i>

You need to stay calm, sir.
Try not to get agitated.

17:18.941 --> 17:21.141
I've recovered, sweetheart.

17:24.412 --> 17:27.046
I see no reason why
you can't do the same.

17:39.326 --> 17:41.328
City Hall, please.

( Engine starts )

17:52.575 --> 17:54.909
( Siren wailing )

17:56.779 --> 17:59.814
Listen up, listen up!

17:59.848 --> 18:01.549
This is private
property, people.

18:01.583 --> 18:03.050
If you wanna protest the banks,

18:03.085 --> 18:06.654
I suggest you take it to
their door, not this one.

18:06.688 --> 18:09.857
Otherwise, you run the risk of
getting arrested for trespassing.

18:09.891 --> 18:12.525
- Hey, officer, maybe I can help.
- ( Crowd laughs, murmurs )

18:12.560 --> 18:14.994
- How are you doing, folks?
- ( People groaning )

18:15.029 --> 18:18.297
I know many of you have heard
a lot about me lately...

another bullshit politician.</i>

18:23.437 --> 18:25.473
Woman: <i>Yeah, exactly.</i>

18:25.474 --> 18:27.508
Hey, asshole, stop
using us for publicity.

18:27.542 --> 18:30.477
- Man: <i>That's right, man.</i>
- What publicity?

18:30.512 --> 18:32.813
Huh? You had the news here
this morning, right?

18:32.847 --> 18:34.515
For 10 minutes?

18:34.549 --> 18:37.150
But they're gone now and so is any
awareness of you or your neighbors

18:37.185 --> 18:39.819
who are getting evicted from their homes
they've been making payments on for years.

18:39.853 --> 18:42.155
- Hey, come on. Come on.
- Me? I've got a big spotlight on me.

18:42.189 --> 18:43.456
Use it.

18:46.027 --> 18:49.929
All right, everyone link
arms, make a chain.

18:49.964 --> 18:52.332
<i>Let's show the banks</i>

evacuations at Lennox Gardens

have become increasingly
violent in the past hour...

No, I'm not.

19:28.704 --> 19:31.472

You can't leave,

20:04.773 --> 20:06.708
Well, we just have
a lot of work.

20:06.742 --> 20:08.877
Mrs. Kane, do you have anything
to say to the people of Chicago?

20:09.411 --> 20:12.647
Just that I'm so grateful

20:12.682 --> 20:14.950
for their encouragement
and support.

20:14.984 --> 20:20.389
And it's wonderful
to be back among you,

to be, again,

20:23.659 --> 20:25.493
in the service
of this great city

20:25.528 --> 20:27.963

20:27.997 --> 20:29.998
Thank you so much.
Excuse me.

20:30.032 --> 20:31.499

Yes. How may
I help you, Mrs. Kane?

<i>( Door closes )</i>

20:55.322 --> 20:57.390

it seemed necessary

20:59.993 --> 21:01.460
Ron, the press...

21:01.494 --> 21:03.862
let them know the mayor's
hunkered down on the fifth floor

escalations of events.

21:05.898 --> 21:07.466
We'll need a cover story

21:07.467 --> 21:08.833
Right.

21:08.868 --> 21:12.937
I'm sorry, but what exactly
are the circumstances?

21:12.972 --> 21:14.272
Where is the mayor?

21:14.306 --> 21:15.740
You'll be apprised soon enough.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.610
Until then, I believe
you have a job to perform

21:18.645 --> 21:20.312
either way.

21:22.015 --> 21:24.617
My understanding is that
you've been a prime mover

21:24.651 --> 21:26.920
behind things
at Lennox Gardens,

21:26.954 --> 21:29.355
which suggests you bear
a certain burden

21:29.390 --> 21:31.391
to see this powder keg
contained.

21:31.426 --> 21:33.661
( Chimes )

Council leadership
is calling for

21:38.899 --> 21:40.834
an emergency meeting
in the chambers.

21:40.868 --> 21:43.803
How do you propose
we handle that, Mrs. Kane?

21:47.808 --> 21:50.276
Here in the conference room,

21:50.311 --> 21:52.779
away from the prying eyes
of the press.

21:55.032 --> 21:56.316
That'll be all for now.

22:03.690 --> 22:06.258
"Bear a certain burden"?

22:06.293 --> 22:09.128
Fuck you.

the reins like that?

22:12.366 --> 22:14.166
I think she did.

22:15.435 --> 22:16.902
All right, y'all.

22:16.936 --> 22:20.839
Stick to the chain stores,

For what?

You know your problem?

23:05.352 --> 23:07.587
You're too weak to lead,

Tssh.

Deliberation is not inaction.

Are rumors true, Mr. Mayor,

Can someone please tell me

25:51.221 --> 25:52.655
- His office?

Because Moretti said so?

25:58.996 --> 26:00.564

( Ringing )

26:08.707 --> 26:10.707
Kitty:

Look, I'm not good
at this sort of thing, okay?

26:16.047 --> 26:17.615
What sort of thing is that?

26:17.649 --> 26:19.450
Please don't make this

26:21.820 --> 26:23.321
I'm not.

26:23.355 --> 26:27.926

what this is between us.

26:29.729 --> 26:31.964
I don't know,

you're a journalist.

26:35.734 --> 26:38.069
I won't take that as an insult.

26:38.103 --> 26:41.272
And I'm... whatever,
an operative.

26:41.306 --> 26:43.374
I'm sensing some
pretty blurry boundaries.

26:43.408 --> 26:44.976
I'm willing to stay in my Lane

26:58.892 --> 27:01.360
<i>You need more than that?</i>

27:01.394 --> 27:03.728

27:05.498 --> 27:07.065
Hello, everyone.

27:07.099 --> 27:09.667
Thank you for agreeing
to join us upstairs.

27:10.702 --> 27:12.203
First and foremost,

27:12.237 --> 27:14.271
the mayor is fine
and in control.

27:14.306 --> 27:15.906
<i>I've just been</i>
<i>in touch with him.</i>

27:15.940 --> 27:19.343
<i>But what I'm about to tell you</i>
<i>is not to leave this room</i>

27:19.377 --> 27:21.845
and, for reasons of security,
is not what the public

27:21.880 --> 27:24.114
<i>has been or will be told.</i>

27:24.148 --> 27:26.283
So please, respect
the sensitivity.

27:26.317 --> 27:29.587
<i>Late last night, before this
morning's troubles began,</i>

27:29.621 --> 27:33.024
the mayor was summoned
to Washington by the FBI

27:33.058 --> 27:34.692
regarding matters
linked to the attempt

27:34.726 --> 27:37.729
<i>made on his life and mine.</i>

27:37.763 --> 27:39.764
The exact nature
of these matters

27:39.798 --> 27:42.500
even I cannot know
from my husband,

27:42.535 --> 27:45.703
but they appear to require
his urgent involvement.

27:45.738 --> 27:48.306
In DC now, as we speak?

27:48.341 --> 27:53.011
Meredith: <i>Yes, for time-sensitive
reasons as of late last night.</i>

27:53.045 --> 27:55.947
<i>I should add that given</i>
<i>the standard hostile relations</i>

27:55.982 --> 27:58.984
<i>between the FBI and</i>
<i>the State's Attorney's office,</i>

27:59.018 --> 28:02.921
even Mr. Doyle will not be
privy to the mayor's absence.

28:02.956 --> 28:05.257
- And he comes back when?
- As soon as he's able to.

28:05.291 --> 28:08.693
In the meantime, he is in constant
contact with Superintendent Royczyk,

28:08.728 --> 28:10.696
Chief Malley,
and Governor Cullen.

28:10.730 --> 28:13.765
<i>Anything he would do,</i>
<i>he's doing from there.</i>

28:13.799 --> 28:15.867

Meredith:
<i>Alderman Ross,</i>

28:17.703 --> 28:19.270
I would hope there's enough
water under the bridge

28:19.305 --> 28:22.340
to wash away
the usual recriminations.

28:22.374 --> 28:25.310
The mayor's expecting
everyone's cooperation

28:25.344 --> 28:26.845
until he returns.

28:28.214 --> 28:30.582
Did you two know about this?

28:30.616 --> 28:32.651
As of early this morning.

28:32.686 --> 28:34.486
Hmm.

28:35.271 --> 28:38.891
Will the mayor be available
to join us by speakerphone?

28:38.926 --> 28:41.861
Not for the moment.

28:41.896 --> 28:44.064
Now then, to the
situation at hand.

28:49.103 --> 28:50.570

Hell no, we won't go!
Hell no, we won't go!

28:57.178 --> 28:59.412
How long are all of you
planning on staying here?

28:59.447 --> 29:01.548
Until the banks
give us an extension.

29:01.582 --> 29:03.917
And is it true that
State Treasurer Zajac

29:03.952 --> 29:06.987
- organized this protest?
- No, it's not.

29:07.021 --> 29:10.157
Mr. Zajac, is this an attempt to get
back in your wife's good graces?

29:10.191 --> 29:12.659
How do you plan to recover
from the scandal?

29:12.694 --> 29:14.795
I'm not the person
you need to be directing

29:14.829 --> 29:16.496
your questions at
about recovery.

29:16.531 --> 29:17.998
This man's about
to lose his home.

29:18.033 --> 29:20.434
And so is this woman and so is
that gentleman right there.

29:20.469 --> 29:23.071
( Cheering )

29:23.105 --> 29:24.706
Maybe if the press
was more interested

29:24.740 --> 29:26.808
in what's going on
in the real world

29:26.842 --> 29:28.843
instead of what's happening
in people's bedrooms,

29:28.878 --> 29:30.345
we wouldn't be in this mess.

29:30.379 --> 29:32.381

29:32.415 --> 29:34.449

- Get that shit out of my face!

29:34.484 --> 29:38.119
- You need to back off.
- Cool it. Just relax.

29:38.154 --> 29:40.621

- Yo, man, what the fuck?

29:40.656 --> 29:41.989
Hey, hey.
Walk away.

29:42.023 --> 29:43.257

This whole thing's

30:01.641 --> 30:03.943
He needs to say
something to the public.

Meredith: The superintendent and his

39:16.072 --> 39:18.140
We've quite a history
together, don't we?

39:18.174 --> 39:20.209
And I think we'd prefer
to speak privately,

39:20.243 --> 39:22.177

39:24.214 --> 39:25.714
We'll be right outside.

He could have been
abducted for all we know.

39:40.263 --> 39:42.397
That's the point...
we don't know anything.

39:42.431 --> 39:44.633
Clearly, Mrs. Kane does.

the State's Attorney

Royczyk:
<i>Yes.</i>

40:02.418 --> 40:05.220
I also heard that the mayor

40:05.254 --> 40:07.522
which isn't true.

40:07.557 --> 40:09.024
( Sighs )

40:09.058 --> 40:10.892
An obvious miscommunication.

40:13.329 --> 40:17.032
Jim, a clean conscience

40:17.066 --> 40:19.000
can wait in situations
like this,

40:19.035 --> 40:21.002
clean streets cannot.

40:21.037 --> 40:22.671
What do you need
to make that happen?

40:25.308 --> 40:28.543
Direct word from Tom
endorsing the use

40:28.578 --> 40:30.912
of armored vehicles
and tactical squads

40:30.947 --> 40:34.483
to contain the hot spots
where unrest is spreading.

40:34.517 --> 40:37.019
Hmm, of course.

40:37.053 --> 40:41.156
Unless it was
deemed wiser to look

40:41.191 --> 40:44.927
to the National Guard
for the same.

40:46.596 --> 40:49.264
So, Cullen's in charge
with Kane gone?

40:49.298 --> 40:50.932
Here's what needs to happen...

40:50.967 --> 40:53.635
a public statement
to the press by you

40:53.669 --> 40:56.705
that given the unrest and the
heightened security concerns,

40:56.740 --> 40:59.374
with the attempted
assassination case still open,

40:59.409 --> 41:02.945
it's been decided that mayor Kane
should stay out of the public eye

41:02.980 --> 41:05.781
until the dust settles,
et cetera, et cetera.

41:05.815 --> 41:08.017
How does that make
for clean streets?

41:08.051 --> 41:10.386
One step at a time.

41:10.420 --> 41:12.121
And after
last night's shooting,

41:12.155 --> 41:14.990
I imagine that your next step

41:15.025 --> 41:19.028
is doing what it takes
to keep your job, no?

41:23.399 --> 41:25.801
Due to heightened
security concerns,

41:25.835 --> 41:27.537
it has been deemed necessary

41:27.571 --> 41:30.006
that the mayor remain
in a secure location.

41:30.040 --> 41:31.774
Reporter:

47:39.238 --> 47:42.541
- Meredith?
- <i>Hello, Mac.</i>

47:42.575 --> 47:45.010
Things up there must be
worse than they look

47:45.044 --> 47:48.780
for you to be calling me or...
I don't know what to think.

47:48.815 --> 47:52.450
We've always had a mutual
respect, Mac, you and I.

47:52.485 --> 47:56.021
We have, you being cut from the
same cloth as your father.

47:58.925 --> 48:01.193
20 years ago, he urged Tom

48:01.228 --> 48:02.928
to ask Governor Dunham
for a deployment

48:02.963 --> 48:05.598
of the National Guard
to quell the riots.

48:06.132 --> 48:07.400
In hindsight it was

48:07.434 --> 48:10.370
- <i>Tom's first mistake as mayor.</i>
- But not his last.

48:10.904 --> 48:14.374
I would like to prevent the same
mistake from happening twice,

48:14.408 --> 48:18.011
<i>and only your office</i>
<i>has the power</i>

48:18.045 --> 48:20.313
<i>to reach both city and state.</i>

48:23.718 --> 48:25.719
I'd like to hear it from him.

48:25.753 --> 48:29.723
You will in due time.

48:29.758 --> 48:31.258
On my honor.

48:37.032 --> 48:40.134
Mac: <i>As the outgoing governor</i>
<i>of this great State,</i>

48:40.169 --> 48:43.872
<i>it is with pride and regret that
one of my last actions in office</i>

48:43.906 --> 48:45.974
will be a deployment
of the National Guard

48:46.008 --> 48:47.876
to quell the strife
in Chicago...

48:48.410 --> 48:51.245
regret that such a situation
ever came to this,

48:51.280 --> 48:56.451
<i>but pride that we the people of
Illinois would face it head on.</i>

48:56.485 --> 48:58.286
<i>I've been in touch</i>
<i>with the mayor's office there</i>

48:58.320 --> 49:00.488
and will remain so
until the unrest

49:00.523 --> 49:02.156
has fully subsided.

49:02.191 --> 49:03.758
She pulled the trigger on this?

49:03.793 --> 49:05.260
I don't think
you'll be disappointed

49:05.294 --> 49:06.796
by the mayor's
inevitable reaction.

49:06.831 --> 49:08.666
While State Senator Walsh
and I have had

49:08.700 --> 49:10.734
our disagreements in the past,

49:10.769 --> 49:13.838
her proposed bill denying
felons the right to vote

49:13.872 --> 49:16.908
<i>can't reach my desk</i>
<i>fast enough.</i>

49:16.942 --> 49:18.776
Did he just endorse
Walsh for governor?

49:18.811 --> 49:23.047
Those responsible for the crimes
of the past two days in Chicago

49:23.081 --> 49:27.418
will have no say in who
their future leaders are.

49:27.452 --> 49:29.086
Thank you.

49:31.590 --> 49:34.191
Reporter: As many as 4,000
national guardsmen have arrived...

49:34.226 --> 49:35.693
Wow.

49:35.727 --> 49:39.530
- Peace is restored.
- ( Ringing )

49:41.467 --> 49:43.534
Uh, give me a sec?

49:45.604 --> 49:47.238
Hey.

49:47.272 --> 49:49.807
Hey. Takeout's
getting cold.

49:49.841 --> 49:51.909
<i>Looks like I'm gonna be late</i>
<i>with all the troops in town.</i>

49:51.943 --> 49:54.445
What's up with Cullen
going public, but not Kane?

49:54.479 --> 49:56.213
<i>It's not strategic timing</i>
<i>on his part,</i>

49:56.248 --> 49:59.417
<i>it's just</i>
<i>a good old no-show.</i>

49:59.451 --> 50:02.119
<i>I mean, the question is why?</i>

50:03.955 --> 50:06.357
- Sam?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

50:08.727 --> 50:11.629
The papers on your table...

50:11.664 --> 50:12.664
Rosebud.

50:14.232 --> 50:15.366
Okay.

50:15.401 --> 50:17.468
<i>That's who leaked the
Bensenville document, right?</i>

50:19.663 --> 50:22.273
I'm pretty sure
the handwriting's Stone's.

50:30.549 --> 50:34.586
- Doctor: <i>Tell me what you see.</i>
- <i>( Projector clicks )</i>

50:34.620 --> 50:36.121
A beach.

50:40.227 --> 50:42.328
A bouquet of flowers.

50:44.265 --> 50:46.333
Ice cream.

50:46.367 --> 50:48.735
<i>( Projector clicks )</i>

50:52.574 --> 50:54.842
A desert.

51:01.082 --> 51:04.218
Emma:
<i>Grandpa? Grandpa.</i>

51:04.752 --> 51:07.555
Grandpa, did they...

51:08.339 --> 51:11.325
Did they do this to you?

51:11.360 --> 51:14.362
<i>Grandpa, did they?</i>
