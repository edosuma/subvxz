Harley, what are you doing?

01:53.761 --> 01:56.331
- Why did you scream?
- Because you scared me.

01:58.499 --> 02:00.602
Hey, Drooper. Mail's here.

02:02.404 --> 02:03.437
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

02:08.476 --> 02:10.710
It's the middle of the night.
Why are you awake?

02:10.711 --> 02:13.479
I'm too excited.
I can't go to sleep.

02:13.481 --> 02:17.049
It's not your birthday yet.

02:17.051 --> 02:19.519
It's past midnight.

02:19.521 --> 02:21.787
Okay.

02:21.789 --> 02:24.793
It is your birthday, but we're
not celebrating it yet.

02:26.594 --> 02:29.831
Come on. Let's go.
Let's get you back to bed.

03:10.004 --> 03:12.172
Mom.

03:12.174 --> 03:15.074
Um, uh, what time is it?

03:15.076 --> 03:18.878
It's past your curfew.
That's what time it is.

03:18.880 --> 03:22.416
Mom, I'm-I'm 19. Why do I
have to be home by midnight?

03:22.418 --> 03:25.484
Because I wanna know that
you're safe before I go to bed.

03:25.486 --> 03:26.919
I worry about you, Austin.

03:26.921 --> 03:29.121
Just,
please don't tell Mitch, okay?

03:29.123 --> 03:31.458
I can't handle
another one of his lectures.

03:31.460 --> 03:33.492
Okay.

03:33.494 --> 03:36.096
Just promise me that you won't
mess with him tomorrow.

03:36.098 --> 03:37.430
I just really want
your brother's birthday

03:37.432 --> 03:38.865
to be perfect.

03:38.867 --> 03:40.803
Yeah, so do I. Me too.

03:42.037 --> 03:43.373
Okay.

03:45.440 --> 03:48.009
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

03:58.486 --> 04:00.686
The flu? Really?

04:00.688 --> 04:02.222
You sure?

04:02.224 --> 04:04.691
Wow. Both hands. Okay.

04:04.693 --> 04:08.161
Um, well, I..

04:08.163 --> 04:10.697
Please tell Duncan
I hope he feels better.

04:10.699 --> 04:13.934
Okay, bye.
Duncan has the flu.

04:13.936 --> 04:15.568
He's not gonna be able
to come with us.

04:15.570 --> 04:17.603
Harley's gonna be
so disappointed.

04:17.606 --> 04:18.870
So invite one
of his other friends.

04:18.873 --> 04:20.140
He doesn't have
any other friends.

04:20.142 --> 04:22.111
Duncan's the only one
he plays with.

04:23.245 --> 04:24.614
Really?

04:27.248 --> 04:29.950
There's gotta be someone else
we can invite.

04:29.952 --> 04:31.116
There's not too many kids
his age

04:31.118 --> 04:33.886
that still like that show.

04:33.888 --> 04:35.020
It's because it's stupid, Beth.

04:37.493 --> 04:38.859
It's his favorite show

04:38.861 --> 04:40.826
and I bought tickets
five months ago

04:40.828 --> 04:41.927
so like it or not

04:41.929 --> 04:43.963
we are going to a live taping

04:43.965 --> 04:46.501
of "The Banana Splits."

Oh!

05:11.960 --> 05:14.059
- 'Hello.'
- Hi.

05:14.061 --> 05:15.595
This is Harley's mom calling.

05:39.287 --> 05:41.054
What are you doing?

05:41.056 --> 05:43.623
Um, looking for my other sock.

05:43.625 --> 05:44.924
Thought, thought
maybe it got mixed up

05:44.926 --> 05:46.258
'with yours, but it didn't.'

05:46.260 --> 05:48.929
So you weren't stealing
money from me?

05:48.931 --> 05:51.864
No. I wasn't, Mitch.

05:51.866 --> 05:53.133
Because you know
if you need money

05:53.135 --> 05:55.701
you can just ask me, right?

05:55.703 --> 05:58.237
Okay.
Can I have, uh, 20 bucks?

05:58.239 --> 06:01.140
No. Not a chance.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.282
Dick.

06:13.087 --> 06:15.020
- Yay!
- Happy birthday, sweetheart.

06:15.022 --> 06:16.791
Happy birthday, buddy.

06:18.092 --> 06:19.662
Happy birthday, Harley.

06:23.164 --> 06:25.765
Oh. A tiny wand.

06:25.767 --> 06:27.937
No, no. Uh, push the button.

06:32.274 --> 06:34.773
Your old one broke,
so I got you a new one.

06:34.775 --> 06:36.275
I love it, Austin.

06:36.277 --> 06:38.979
We have another surprise
for you. We...

06:38.981 --> 06:42.982
Are going
to "The Banana Splits."

06:42.984 --> 06:46.285
Thank you so much, daddy.

06:46.287 --> 06:48.354
- You're the best.
- Harley, we talked about this.

06:48.356 --> 06:50.659
You're too old
to call me daddy, okay?

06:54.962 --> 06:57.696
There's five tickets.
Can Duncan come?

06:57.698 --> 06:59.633
Oh, Duncan is sick, sweetheart

06:59.635 --> 07:01.234
but I called
another one of your friends

07:01.236 --> 07:04.337
and they are so excited to go.

07:04.339 --> 07:06.672
I don't wanna see
"The Banana Splits."

07:06.674 --> 07:09.208
Oh, Zoe, come on. It was nice
enough that they invited you.

07:09.210 --> 07:12.111
- We're not even friends.
- Well, maybe he wants to be.

07:12.113 --> 07:14.347
Mom, he's weird.
He believes in fairies

07:14.349 --> 07:16.982
and thinks he can talk to
animals. Please don't make me.

07:16.984 --> 07:18.785
It's his birthday
and you're going

07:18.787 --> 07:20.886
and that's final.

07:20.888 --> 07:22.321
But that show's for babies.

07:22.323 --> 07:24.657
Oh, and suddenly
you're so mature.

07:24.659 --> 07:26.595
You have bunnies
on your undies.

07:27.828 --> 07:29.895
Go upstairs and get dressed.

07:29.897 --> 07:31.967
They're coming to get you
in ten minutes.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.107
Welcome to Taft Studios.

07:42.109 --> 07:44.277
Hi. Yeah, we're here
to see the, uh...

07:44.279 --> 07:47.112
"The Banana Splits." We're
seeing "The Banana Splits."

07:47.114 --> 07:50.015
- It's my birthday.
- He's a little excited.

07:50.017 --> 07:51.854
Just need your ID.

07:55.356 --> 07:57.924
You're just gonna follow
the main avenue

07:57.926 --> 07:59.893
down to Stage 12.

07:59.895 --> 08:03.229
Hang a right, and then a left,
and then two more rights.

08:03.231 --> 08:06.398
Stage 1 is kind of tucked back
in the corner.

08:06.400 --> 08:09.234
Uh, you know what?
It's all in the map.

08:09.236 --> 08:10.903
Thanks.

08:10.905 --> 08:13.439
I can't believe
you actually get to work here.

08:13.441 --> 08:15.874
Is this the best job
in the world?

08:15.876 --> 08:17.710
Do you know
"The Banana Splits?"

08:17.712 --> 08:19.746
Beth, those wings are staying
in the car.

08:19.748 --> 08:22.381
You know, sometimes at night

08:22.383 --> 08:24.850
when I'm the only one here

08:24.852 --> 08:28.455
I see the Splits riding around
in their little cars

08:28.457 --> 08:31.224
laughin' and singin'.

08:31.226 --> 08:33.696
- Really?
- He's playing with you, Harley.

08:38.967 --> 08:41.500
'Harley, you excited?'

08:41.501 --> 08:43.769
'I really wanna meet Snorky.'

08:43.770 --> 08:45.471
'Zoe, did you ever dream'

08:45.473 --> 08:48.108
'that you'd get to meet
the Banana Splits?'

08:48.110 --> 08:49.408
'No?'

08:49.410 --> 08:52.345
'No, I did not.'

08:52.347 --> 08:55.315
"The Banana Splits" is
me and Austin's favorite show.

08:55.317 --> 08:57.050
'Really?'

08:57.052 --> 08:58.417
'So how long
have you been watching'

08:58.419 --> 09:00.452
' "The Banana Splits?"'

09:00.454 --> 09:02.888
'Uh..'

09:02.890 --> 09:06.058
'I'm-I'm-I'm sure she,
she really loves the show.'

09:06.060 --> 09:08.261
'I hope Snorky
does the Snorky Shuffle.'

09:08.263 --> 09:10.229
'It's so funny.'

09:10.231 --> 09:12.231
'He's totally gonna do it.
He does it every time.'

09:12.233 --> 09:15.033
'Sounds awesome.'

09:15.035 --> 09:17.402
'Oh, map says Stage 1'

09:17.404 --> 09:19.839
'is the oldest sound stage
at Taft Studios.'

09:19.841 --> 09:21.840
'This is going to
be the best birthday ever.'

09:21.842 --> 09:23.779
'I'm never gonna forget it.'

09:32.154 --> 09:34.787
Who's excited to see
"The Banana Splits?"

09:37.292 --> 09:38.825
Hi, I'm Paige.

09:38.827 --> 09:41.226
The audience page.
Paige, the page.

09:41.228 --> 09:43.329
Guess you could say
I was born to do this job.

09:43.331 --> 09:44.497
God, I hope not.

09:44.499 --> 09:46.065
Please have your tickets ready

09:46.067 --> 09:47.466
and I'll get you checked
in lickety-splits.

09:47.468 --> 09:50.069
- Oh!
- That's lame.

09:50.071 --> 09:52.108
I know it's bad.
They make me say it.

09:56.443 --> 09:58.344
Cell phones, please.

09:58.346 --> 10:00.345
'Thank you.
Thank you so much.'

10:00.347 --> 10:02.949
Parker, seriously?
Stop chewing on your hair.

10:02.951 --> 10:04.883
I just paid $70
for that blow up

10:04.885 --> 10:07.019
and straighten up.

10:07.021 --> 10:09.455
What's up, you guys?
Check it out, right?

10:09.457 --> 10:12.224
We're here at the Taft Studios.

10:12.226 --> 10:16.461
The home of "The Banana Splits"
since 1969.

10:16.463 --> 10:20.465
This is hallowed ground,
my friends.

10:20.467 --> 10:22.969
And we're gonna be going live
all day long.

10:22.971 --> 10:24.838
- Behind the scenes.
- Oh, yeah.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.974
Actually, there's no cell phones
allowed inside, so..

10:27.976 --> 10:29.508
Seriously?

10:29.510 --> 10:31.411
I just told all my followers

10:31.413 --> 10:34.013
like all of them,
that I'll be going live.

10:34.015 --> 10:36.248
Well, you can tell your..

10:36.250 --> 10:39.018
...218 followers all about it
after the show.

10:39.020 --> 10:40.887
Yeah.
I'm not giving up my phone.

10:40.889 --> 10:42.892
- Then you can't come in.
- Thadd.

10:44.491 --> 10:46.261
It's fine.

10:49.496 --> 10:51.500
Thanks. Enjoy the show.

11:08.650 --> 11:10.249
Harley!

11:22.264 --> 11:23.428
What the hell
were you thinking?

11:23.430 --> 11:24.898
Mom, did you see that?

11:24.900 --> 11:27.032
I waved at Snorky,
but he didn't wave back.

11:27.034 --> 11:29.167
You have to be more careful
than that.

11:29.169 --> 11:31.104
Mom, Snorky wouldn't hurt me.

11:31.106 --> 11:33.273
He's my favorite.

11:33.275 --> 11:35.675
Zoe,
which one's your favorite?

11:35.677 --> 11:38.677
- The cat.
- There isn't a cat.

11:38.679 --> 11:42.348
Uh, she means the..
Drooper, the lion.

11:42.350 --> 11:44.920
Yeah. That's what I meant.
The lion.

11:46.353 --> 11:49.589
I can't believe
he just ran out like that.

11:49.591 --> 11:51.327
- Mitch.
- Huh?

11:54.663 --> 11:56.195
Hey, I need that. It's work.

11:56.197 --> 11:59.498
Harley was almost hit
by a Banana Buggy.

11:59.500 --> 12:01.700
Jesus, that would have been
an embarrassing way to die.

12:01.702 --> 12:03.436
- Phones, please.
- No, no, no.

12:03.438 --> 12:05.171
I-I need that for work.

12:05.173 --> 12:06.940
Don't worry, they'll be safe
in the production office

12:06.942 --> 12:08.977
till after the show.
Thank you.

12:13.515 --> 12:15.281
Hey, uh, here you go.

12:15.283 --> 12:18.153
You can put your number
in there if you want.

12:21.289 --> 12:24.389
I'm, I'm so sorry.
I don't know why I said that.

12:24.391 --> 12:27.225
I thought it would sound cool,
like-like smooth.

12:27.227 --> 12:28.293
- It didn't.
- Okay.

12:28.295 --> 12:29.494
Just take my phone, please.

12:29.496 --> 12:31.500
I did.. Just hate myself.

12:32.733 --> 12:35.701
- That was painful, bro.
- Hmm. Yeah.

12:35.703 --> 12:37.072
'Yeah.'

13:13.408 --> 13:16.575
How was your drive, boys?

13:16.577 --> 13:19.745
You naughty splits.

13:19.747 --> 13:22.382
You almost hit that little boy.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.383
Someone's reflex subroutine

13:24.385 --> 13:27.387
needs a little tweaking, hm?

13:27.389 --> 13:30.355
We'll start with you, Drooper.
Hmm.

13:30.357 --> 13:33.393
'You boys, get backstage.'

13:33.395 --> 13:34.761
As you know..

13:37.399 --> 13:39.668
The show must go on.

13:49.309 --> 13:51.244
Let's get you updated, eh?

13:51.246 --> 13:53.615
We don't want
any hiccups today, do we?

13:58.419 --> 13:59.587
Ah.

14:10.231 --> 14:11.663
The script says giant hammer.

14:11.665 --> 14:14.302
What I'm holding
is a regular hammer.

14:15.803 --> 14:18.439
No..
Tell Props I'm coming to them.

14:25.813 --> 14:27.613
Where's Drooper?

14:27.615 --> 14:30.182
Does anybody have a 20
on Drooper?

14:30.184 --> 14:32.220
Damn it.
Do I have to do everything?

14:35.255 --> 14:38.191
- Rebecca, you got a minute?
- No. I don't.

14:38.193 --> 14:40.192
'We're about to
start and I'm a Split short.'

14:40.194 --> 14:43.528
Okay, well,
I was gonna do this gently

14:43.530 --> 14:46.099
but since you're in a rush,
I'm canceling the show.

14:46.101 --> 14:47.834
What?

14:47.836 --> 14:50.636
Uh, you probably heard
about my promotion this morning?

14:50.638 --> 14:52.772
No, I didn't.
I'm a little busy, Andy.

14:52.774 --> 14:54.440
Oh, are you?

14:54.442 --> 14:56.742
Well, I'm the vice president
of Programming now

14:56.744 --> 14:58.444
and "The Banana Splits"
doesn't really

14:58.446 --> 15:00.278
represent my vision
for the network.

15:00.280 --> 15:02.581
Are you kidding?
We're still a huge hit.

15:02.583 --> 15:05.585
Yeah, but it's old and stupid.

15:05.587 --> 15:07.887
And I wanna do something cool
and edgy

15:07.889 --> 15:09.888
so today's your last show.

15:09.890 --> 15:12.691
But we have tapings
lined up for weeks.

15:12.693 --> 15:14.429
Not anymore.

15:25.405 --> 15:28.209
Somebody find Karl and tell him
to get Drooper out on stage.

15:40.321 --> 15:42.654
Welcome to "The Banana Splits."

15:45.760 --> 15:47.192
Yay!

15:47.194 --> 15:49.862
Whoo! Hoo-hoo!

15:49.864 --> 15:52.230
Now, I want you all
to check your tickets

15:52.232 --> 15:56.168
'because we've got a little
extra treat for some of you.'

15:56.170 --> 15:58.771
If you've got stars in the back,
then you're in luck.

15:58.773 --> 16:03.242
You get to stay after the show
and meet "The Banana Splits."

16:03.244 --> 16:04.509
And Stevie.

16:04.511 --> 16:06.778
A-and Stevie.
Don't forget Stevie.

16:06.780 --> 16:10.248
- Mom, hurry.
- I know, honey. I'm checking.

16:10.250 --> 16:14.387
Yes! We got stars.
We got stars.

16:14.389 --> 16:16.589
Oh, my God.
Thadd, Thadd!

16:16.591 --> 16:19.495
Baby, we are gonna
meet the Splits.

16:22.529 --> 16:26.135
- We didn't get stars.
- It's okay, honey.

16:38.446 --> 16:42.514
'Taft Studios
presents "The Banana Splits."'

16:45.352 --> 16:46.619
Whoo!

16:46.621 --> 16:48.890
'Starring Fleegle..'

16:51.726 --> 16:53.529
'...Snorky..'

16:56.563 --> 16:58.400
'...Bingo..'

17:04.471 --> 17:05.471
Bingo!

17:05.473 --> 17:07.242
'Drooper.'

17:09.009 --> 17:10.578
'Drooper.'

17:13.281 --> 17:14.445
'Drooper?'

17:14.448 --> 17:17.817
- Where the hell is it?
- It just..

17:17.819 --> 17:19.651
Just go out there and say

17:19.653 --> 17:21.685
Drooper got caught in
Mr. Walterscheid's fence again.

17:21.688 --> 17:24.624
I'll make sure Karl has him
ready for the next scene.

17:24.626 --> 17:26.259
Cue announcer.

17:26.261 --> 17:29.298
'And featuring Stevie.'

17:35.836 --> 17:37.802
Is that man
dressed like a child?

17:37.804 --> 17:41.741
That's Stevie.
Nobody really likes him.

17:41.743 --> 17:43.642
Guys, we have to get Drooper

17:43.644 --> 17:48.013
out of Mr. Walterscheid's fence
again!

17:54.889 --> 17:58.291
'Our first scene
will begin in a few minutes, folks.'

17:58.293 --> 18:01.026
'So sit tight.'

18:01.028 --> 18:03.763
- Where are you going?
- Bathroom, Mitch.

18:03.765 --> 18:06.032
Want a full report
when I get back?

18:06.034 --> 18:09.034
Spoiler alert.
It's a dump.

18:09.036 --> 18:10.838
Don't be long.

18:21.349 --> 18:25.618
Alert Rebecca that
Drooper is functioning at 100%.

18:25.620 --> 18:27.555
I'm sending him to the stage.

18:52.846 --> 18:55.513
'It's Sloppy Time!'

18:55.515 --> 18:58.751
'Give it up
for Ashley and Trevor!'

18:58.753 --> 19:01.920
'Watch out for that slide.'

19:01.922 --> 19:04.790
'Oh, there goes Ashley.'

19:04.792 --> 19:06.458
That should have been you
out there.

19:06.460 --> 19:08.093
I don't wanna get messy.

19:08.095 --> 19:09.895
You wanna get discovered
or not?

19:09.897 --> 19:11.397
Because if you're not
committed to this

19:11.399 --> 19:14.065
you tell me right now.

19:14.067 --> 19:16.804
'And they're
coming up to the balance beam.'

19:19.806 --> 19:22.006
'Watch out for those eyes!'

19:29.583 --> 19:33.619
'Oh, and Trevor's down
for the count.'

19:33.621 --> 19:37.389
'Only one left.
Can she find the blue key?'

19:37.391 --> 19:39.361
I don't know
what's taking Austin so long.

19:40.628 --> 19:43.561
I'll go find him.

19:43.563 --> 19:45.164
No, no, no, no.
You don't have to. It's okay.

19:45.166 --> 19:48.167
No, it's fine. I've gotta check
in the office, anyway, so..

19:48.169 --> 19:49.702
Really?
It's Harley's birthday.

19:49.704 --> 19:51.704
You can't forget about work
for one day?

19:51.706 --> 19:53.438
I'm just gonna check in.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.073
You don't even have
your cell phone.

19:55.075 --> 19:57.879
Then I'll find one
right after I find Austin.

19:59.613 --> 20:00.815
Okay.

20:03.784 --> 20:06.484
'And Ashley's
moving up the ladder.'

20:08.456 --> 20:11.557
Ashley! Ashley! Ashley!

20:11.559 --> 20:13.628
It's time to fly.

20:36.082 --> 20:39.651
She took it down to Hammer Town.

20:39.653 --> 20:42.022
For the love of God,
can somebody find Stevie?

20:44.225 --> 20:47.025
He's in the next scene.

20:48.463 --> 20:49.831
Stevie.

20:51.998 --> 20:54.867
- Are you drunk?
- No.

20:54.869 --> 20:56.668
I'm buzzed.

20:56.670 --> 20:59.571
After this, I'll be drunk.

20:59.573 --> 21:00.773
You want one?

21:00.775 --> 21:02.907
Come on,
they need you on set.

21:02.909 --> 21:04.412
Paige.

21:05.746 --> 21:07.980
The page.

21:10.584 --> 21:12.083
I just got that.

21:12.085 --> 21:15.154
Come on, have a drink with me.
One drink.

21:15.156 --> 21:17.590
- Stevie, seriously...
- They wait for the puppets.

21:17.592 --> 21:19.761
They can wait for me.

21:26.033 --> 21:28.069
'You know
that page uniform is..'

21:29.536 --> 21:31.472
...really workin' for ya.

21:32.773 --> 21:35.073
It's working for me too.

21:38.579 --> 21:40.980
Hey. Excuse me.

21:40.982 --> 21:43.616
Dude, I'm not doing autographs
right now.

21:43.618 --> 21:45.921
Okay, I actually wanted
to talk to her.

21:50.925 --> 21:54.059
Tell that bitch Rebecca
I'll be there.

21:54.061 --> 21:57.098
On cue... like always.

21:59.233 --> 22:01.699
I'm sorry.

22:01.701 --> 22:03.535
Hope I didn't get you
in any trouble.

22:03.537 --> 22:05.070
Just 'cause your fits
build on a kid's show

22:05.072 --> 22:07.673
it doesn't mean you get to act
like an epic asshole.

22:07.675 --> 22:09.542
Absolutely.

22:09.544 --> 22:10.743
Probably, um..

22:10.745 --> 22:13.779
I'm not really
in show business.

22:13.781 --> 22:16.282
- So I don't know...
- You're from the audience.

22:16.284 --> 22:18.149
You're not supposed
to be back here.

22:18.151 --> 22:20.087
Yeah, um, that is true.

22:22.122 --> 22:25.090
Um, look, it's my
little brother's birthday

22:25.092 --> 22:27.158
and he's crazy about this show

22:27.160 --> 22:30.829
but we didn't get any stars
on our tickets.

22:30.831 --> 22:33.032
He's like a great kid
and, and you know

22:33.034 --> 22:34.733
meeting the Splits
would be huge.

22:34.735 --> 22:36.769
So I need to know

22:36.771 --> 22:39.338
if there's maybe a way
to, like, hook us up.

22:39.340 --> 22:41.173
- Hook you up?
- Y-yeah.

22:41.175 --> 22:43.908
I stole a $20 bill from my
stepdad's sock drawer, you know.

22:43.910 --> 22:47.045
That's in it for you if that
makes a difference, seriously.

22:47.047 --> 22:49.113
Just stick around after the
show. I'll take care of you.

22:49.115 --> 22:51.317
For real? Seriously?

22:51.319 --> 22:55.123
This is, um, this is,
this is very, very cool.

23:00.261 --> 23:02.828
Yeah, you can return
to your seat now.

23:02.830 --> 23:07.032
Right, yeah, um,
which way would that be? I..

23:07.034 --> 23:08.867
Follow me.

23:08.869 --> 23:10.138
Okay.

23:25.085 --> 23:28.186
Do they usually just walk around
on their own like that?

23:28.188 --> 23:30.121
Not really.

23:30.123 --> 23:31.692
Come on.

23:39.265 --> 23:41.769
Show time, bitches.

23:50.678 --> 23:53.145
'Glen, I told her it's done.'

23:53.147 --> 23:55.347
'The show's cancelled.'

23:55.349 --> 23:57.683
'She was pissed.
What do you think?'

23:57.685 --> 23:59.784
Ha, and ask me if I care?

23:59.786 --> 24:01.954
Of course, I don't.

24:01.956 --> 24:04.723
Th-this show is gonna free up
two stages.

24:04.725 --> 24:06.992
Not to mention, what we can do
with all that tech.

24:06.994 --> 24:09.962
We're gonna tear
those fuzzy bastards apart

24:09.964 --> 24:13.331
and sell 'em
to the theme park division.

24:13.333 --> 24:15.400
"The Banana Splits" show
is done.

24:15.402 --> 24:17.369
It's my call.

24:17.371 --> 24:19.040
Oh, oh, and, and Glen..

24:20.707 --> 24:22.076
...live with it.

25:02.449 --> 25:04.052
Hey!

25:10.123 --> 25:11.990
Are you kidding me?

25:11.992 --> 25:14.092
What the hell is goin' on?

25:53.868 --> 25:56.334
Hey, everybody, it's time

25:56.336 --> 26:00.438
to spin the wheel of endings.

26:04.544 --> 26:07.346
I wonder
how the show's gonna end.

26:07.348 --> 26:12.083
It's gonna end on rock out.
They always end on rock out.

26:12.085 --> 26:15.419
Why don't you spin it, Drooper?

26:15.421 --> 26:20.091
Might be the last time
you ever do.

26:26.233 --> 26:28.269
Okay, Stevie.

26:34.307 --> 26:37.746
Rock out!
Rock out! Rock out! Rock out!

Thank you for coming, everyone.

28:46.607 --> 28:48.706
If you have a star
in your tickets, sit tight.

28:48.708 --> 28:51.109
The rest of you,
Doug will show you out.

28:51.111 --> 28:53.046
Hope you enjoyed the show.

28:55.381 --> 28:57.014
When we get down there

28:57.016 --> 28:59.451
I'll find a producer
and introduce you.

28:59.453 --> 29:01.956
- Don't freeze up. You hear me?
- Yes, daddy.

29:03.423 --> 29:05.389
You excited?

29:05.391 --> 29:07.192
Huh? Yeah.

29:07.194 --> 29:09.528
Yeah, of course.

29:09.530 --> 29:12.496
Your parents follow you
on Instagram, right?

29:12.498 --> 29:14.599
Yeah. Why?

29:14.601 --> 29:17.338
I don't know.
It's just a random thought.

29:21.675 --> 29:23.675
- Sorry, we couldn't stay.
- It's okay.

29:23.677 --> 29:26.677
It was still
a great birthday present.

29:26.679 --> 29:28.480
Where do you think
you're going?

29:28.482 --> 29:30.314
We don't have stars
on our tickets.

29:30.316 --> 29:32.516
Do you really think the Banana
Splits aren't gonna wanna meet

29:32.518 --> 29:34.655
their biggest fan
on his birthday?

29:36.290 --> 29:38.159
How did you know?

29:39.726 --> 29:42.426
Um, sorry,
how long is this gonna take?

29:42.428 --> 29:44.362
- Gotta get Zoe back home.
- Oh.

29:44.364 --> 29:46.398
I don't need to get home.

29:46.400 --> 29:50.167
Okay, great.
Then let's meet the Splits.

29:50.169 --> 29:51.570
Follow me.

29:55.476 --> 29:57.544
Oh, hey, I'll, uh,
I'll be right behind you.

30:15.763 --> 30:19.233
Oh, look, it's my cast-mates.

30:21.768 --> 30:24.037
I was just drinking a toast..

30:25.505 --> 30:28.309
...to our cancellation.

30:30.611 --> 30:33.110
This show's done

30:33.112 --> 30:35.746
because the network thinks
you suck.

30:35.748 --> 30:38.151
You'll never perform
in front of an audience..

30:39.719 --> 30:42.155
...ever again.

30:44.323 --> 30:46.157
Cheers to you.

30:46.159 --> 30:50.765
I've hated every minute
of working with you assholes.

31:29.503 --> 31:31.472
You gotta be kidding me.

31:33.207 --> 31:35.409
Karl's stupid update
didn't work.

31:36.610 --> 31:38.379
Big surprise.

31:43.717 --> 31:46.184
Get the hell out of here.

31:59.765 --> 32:01.601
Goddamn robots.

'"The Banana
Splits Adventure Hour"'

32:53.486 --> 32:55.553
'was first conceived in 1967'

32:55.555 --> 32:58.557
as a send-up of another popular
TV show from the era.

32:58.559 --> 32:59.624
Anyone know which one?

32:59.626 --> 33:02.226
Duh. "The Monkees."

33:02.228 --> 33:03.628
You know, "The Banana Splits"
was supposed

33:03.630 --> 33:05.463
to be called "Banana Bunch."

33:05.465 --> 33:08.934
But there was already
another movie by that name.

33:08.936 --> 33:10.801
Actually,
it was a children's book.

33:10.803 --> 33:12.803
Actually, I'm a pretty big fan

33:12.805 --> 33:13.938
so I think I'd know.

33:13.940 --> 33:16.374
Thadd, let it go.

33:16.376 --> 33:19.444
It's an incredibly sweet thing
you did for your brother.

33:19.446 --> 33:22.647
Hey, his dad sucks,
but I love him.

33:22.649 --> 33:25.849
- And his mom's okay too.
- Cut me some slack.

33:25.851 --> 33:27.586
And why I would I do that?

33:27.588 --> 33:30.421
Because he raised you like a son
for the last 11 years.

33:30.423 --> 33:33.891
Mom, mom, the guy's
a selfish prick. He hates me.

33:33.893 --> 33:35.793
He barely remembered
his own son's birthday.

33:35.795 --> 33:38.530
He doesn't even wanna be here.
He'd rather be at work.

33:38.532 --> 33:41.302
- It's not true.
- Then where is he?

33:49.275 --> 33:51.445
Just stay with your brother.
I'll be right back.

33:55.916 --> 33:57.881
Are you excited?

33:59.620 --> 34:00.985
'Everyone, stay clam.'

34:00.987 --> 34:04.688
I'm sure it's just...
"The Banana Splits."

34:04.690 --> 34:06.494
Oh, my God.

34:09.661 --> 34:11.728
If everybody can get in a line,
I'll make sure

34:11.731 --> 34:14.367
you all get photos
with the Splits.

34:27.280 --> 34:29.580
- Excuse me, miss?
- Uh, one moment, sir.

34:29.581 --> 34:32.382
Jonathan, please.
Call me Jonathan.

34:32.385 --> 34:34.385
Jonathan, you're next.
Just wait your turn.

34:36.755 --> 34:40.791
Uh, miss, excuse me. Miss?

34:40.793 --> 34:43.695
Go to our website
to download the photos.

34:43.697 --> 34:45.362
Dude, what?

34:45.364 --> 34:47.601
I really need
to see the producer.

34:49.402 --> 34:51.503
What's on your cheek?

34:51.505 --> 34:53.536
Oh, I'm not sure.

34:53.539 --> 34:55.639
Must have rubbed off
of Drooper.

34:55.641 --> 34:58.579
I bet it's strawberry from
one of the Sloppy Time pies.

35:01.081 --> 35:03.316
Nope, that's not strawberry.

35:04.718 --> 35:06.450
I don't know what that is.

35:06.452 --> 35:10.354
I really think if the producer
saw Parker, he would...

35:10.356 --> 35:12.890
- She.
- She.

35:12.892 --> 35:14.925
She would realize
that she had a star

35:14.927 --> 35:16.628
standing right in front of her.

35:16.630 --> 35:18.762
She'd probably even
give you a promotion

35:18.764 --> 35:20.698
for making the introduction.

35:20.700 --> 35:23.667
- I can't do that.
- But..

35:23.669 --> 35:26.437
It's not gonna happen.

35:26.439 --> 35:28.039
O-okay.

35:28.041 --> 35:29.776
I understand.

35:32.979 --> 35:35.579
Hey, guys, are you excited
to get your photos?

35:35.581 --> 35:37.414
- Yes.
- Come on, Parker.

35:37.416 --> 35:39.818
We'll have to find
the producer ourselves.

35:44.825 --> 35:47.395
Hey! You can't go back there.

35:52.365 --> 35:55.066
- This is perfect. Come on.
- What are you doing?

35:55.068 --> 35:56.834
Let's check out
the rest of this place.

35:56.836 --> 35:59.037
We can go live
from another set.

35:59.039 --> 36:00.070
I don't think we should.

36:00.072 --> 36:01.673
Babe, it will be a moment

36:01.675 --> 36:04.041
we'll remember forever.

36:04.043 --> 36:06.413
- I promise.
- Okay.

36:08.548 --> 36:10.481
What about our pictures?

36:10.483 --> 36:12.517
Um, I'm sure she'll be back.

36:12.519 --> 36:13.785
Besides,
this is kind of awesome.

36:13.787 --> 36:15.790
You have the Splits
all to yourself.

36:18.023 --> 36:19.726
Come on.

36:22.595 --> 36:25.632
Hi, I'm Harley.
This is my friend Zoe.

36:28.834 --> 36:30.434
Say hi.

36:30.436 --> 36:32.739
Uh, sup?

36:36.108 --> 36:38.511
Why is Drooper all wet?

36:53.459 --> 36:54.994
Where's Snorky?

36:59.800 --> 37:02.901
It's my kid's birthday.
I can't get away.

37:02.903 --> 37:04.872
There's nothin' I can do.
I'm sorry.

37:06.840 --> 37:08.872
Hey. What are you
doin' out here?

37:08.874 --> 37:11.142
'I've been looking
all over for you.'

37:11.144 --> 37:14.144
Um, I told you
I had to call in to the office.

37:14.146 --> 37:16.747
There's some, some stuff
going down.

37:16.749 --> 37:19.716
You're making Kara work
on a Saturday?

37:19.718 --> 37:22.653
But I didn't say Kara.
Why, why would you say Kara?

37:22.655 --> 37:24.888
'Cause she's your assistant.

37:24.890 --> 37:27.725
Who else
will be at the office?

37:27.727 --> 37:29.997
Right. Yes, it was Kara.

37:33.133 --> 37:35.633
Um, are we,
are we ready to go yet?

37:35.635 --> 37:38.169
Yup. Yeah. You wanna come in
with me? We'll grab the kids.

37:38.171 --> 37:40.238
- Sure.
- Okay.

37:40.240 --> 37:41.972
Beth, wait, no.
Beth, please.

37:41.974 --> 37:43.143
'Beth, don't.'

37:45.778 --> 37:48.680
- Oh, my God.
- I can explain.

37:48.682 --> 37:51.548
Like, how can you explain this?

37:51.550 --> 37:53.920
Are you sleeping with her?

38:00.526 --> 38:02.526
I can't believe this.

38:02.528 --> 38:04.195
I swear it was just one time.

38:04.197 --> 38:06.129
There's hundreds of these.

38:06.131 --> 38:08.800
Sleeping with your assistant.
God, you're such a cliche.

38:08.802 --> 38:10.767
- Beth, look...
- I knew it, man.

38:10.769 --> 38:13.070
- I knew you were a scumbag.
- You watch your mouth!

38:13.072 --> 38:14.204
- Austin, go back inside.
- No, no, no, no, don't.

38:14.206 --> 38:16.073
You know what,
she stands up for you

38:16.075 --> 38:19.142
and she defends you and she
tells me to give you a chance.

38:19.144 --> 38:21.678
And the whole time
you've been cheatin' on her?

38:21.680 --> 38:23.548
- I should be, I should...
- You should what?

38:23.550 --> 38:25.883
- Okay, stop, stop, stop.
- You should what, little boy?

38:25.885 --> 38:28.620
You know what? You're just
a 19-year-old burnout.

38:28.622 --> 38:30.024
That's all you are.

38:32.057 --> 38:33.624
- Your dad's lucky he didn't...
- Don't talk about my dad.

38:33.626 --> 38:35.894
Okay, stop, stop it!
Go back inside, okay?

38:35.896 --> 38:37.896
- What're you gonna do about it?
- This is between us.

38:37.898 --> 38:39.963
Us?

38:39.965 --> 38:43.200
Beth, there's never been an us.

38:43.202 --> 38:45.840
There was always Austin
and then there was Harley.

38:47.807 --> 38:48.805
Us.

38:50.677 --> 38:52.111
What a joke.

38:53.847 --> 38:56.747
You know what?
You go inside and get the kids.

38:56.749 --> 38:59.085
I'll be at the car, okay?

39:00.887 --> 39:02.055
Us.

39:12.097 --> 39:14.899
- Mom, mom, stop. Stop.
- No, he is a dick.

39:14.901 --> 39:16.971
Yeah, yeah, I know, okay?

39:18.905 --> 39:21.939
Just wanted to be
with somebody safe

39:21.941 --> 39:24.611
so that you and Harley
would never ever get hurt.

39:33.653 --> 39:35.852
- I'm sorry.
- No.

39:35.854 --> 39:37.791
Don't, don't say that.

39:44.097 --> 39:45.629
You know what? Let's just
go get the kids, okay?

39:45.631 --> 39:47.034
Yeah, yeah.

39:54.073 --> 39:55.740
- 'Hello.'
- Hey.

39:55.742 --> 39:57.678
Guess whose night just freed up.

40:13.827 --> 40:15.994
I can't believe
I'm actually here.

40:15.996 --> 40:18.164
I cant' believe I'm
actually enjoying it.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.834
I dare you to open that.

40:22.836 --> 40:24.836
Why? What's gonna happen?

40:24.838 --> 40:26.303
'Open it. You'll see.'

40:26.305 --> 40:29.207
Unless you're scared.

40:29.209 --> 40:30.675
Ha.

40:35.215 --> 40:37.818
- Come on.
- Don't rush me.

40:46.992 --> 40:48.992
Was something
supposed to happen?

40:48.994 --> 40:52.195
When Drooper does it,
letters shoot out.

40:52.197 --> 40:55.301
Well, uh, there's nothing here.

40:57.202 --> 40:59.206
I never got to meet Snorky.

41:01.740 --> 41:04.975
- Let's go find him.
- Like a quest?

41:04.977 --> 41:06.443
Sure.

41:06.445 --> 41:08.445
Like a quest.

41:08.447 --> 41:10.083
Let's go!

41:12.751 --> 41:14.053
Let's go.

41:16.122 --> 41:18.955
I told you,
I never should have taken this job.

41:18.957 --> 41:22.727
Now look, six years..

41:22.729 --> 41:25.366
...six years on a kid's show
and I get fired.

41:26.932 --> 41:29.700
I mean,
where do I go from here?

41:29.702 --> 41:31.037
Time to fly!

41:35.941 --> 41:38.311
- A-are you the producer?
- I'll call you back.

41:39.878 --> 41:41.211
Something I can do for you?

41:41.213 --> 41:43.448
It's more like
what I can do for you.

41:43.450 --> 41:45.349
Parker, do the thing.

41:45.351 --> 41:47.151
Rebecca, I'm so sorry.

41:47.153 --> 41:49.122
'Parker, this is our shot.'

41:51.957 --> 41:53.758
♪ Whatcha gonna do
with all that junk ♪

41:53.760 --> 41:55.126
♪ All that junk
inside your trunk... ♪♪

41:55.128 --> 41:56.961
Stop.

41:56.963 --> 41:59.229
That is disturbing.

41:59.231 --> 42:00.965
Incredibly dated.

42:00.967 --> 42:03.033
She can sing something else.
What do you wanna hear?

42:03.035 --> 42:05.970
- It doesn't matter.
- 'But she's talented, right?'

42:05.972 --> 42:08.271
She should be in the
Sour Grapes Bunch or somethin'.

42:08.273 --> 42:09.506
You have to put her in the show.

42:09.508 --> 42:11.175
There is no show.
We're canceled.

42:11.177 --> 42:12.744
- What?
- What?

42:12.746 --> 42:14.812
Network pulled the plug.

42:14.814 --> 42:16.280
So, take her junk
somewhere else.

42:16.282 --> 42:18.448
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

42:18.450 --> 42:21.218
Andy told me
right before tonight's show.

42:21.220 --> 42:24.354
- Who's Andy?
- Head of the network.

42:24.356 --> 42:26.860
Is he still here?
I need to see him.

42:29.394 --> 42:31.331
Thank you for the opportunity.

42:32.999 --> 42:35.202
So I'm out of a job.

42:37.336 --> 42:38.905
We all are.

42:41.474 --> 42:42.974
Just get the meet-and-greets
out of here

42:42.976 --> 42:44.977
and we'll start wrapping out
on Monday.

42:53.385 --> 42:56.120
I can't believe it.

42:56.122 --> 42:57.988
Thadd, this is amazing.

42:57.990 --> 43:00.927
That's Snorky's circus
and Bingo's jungle.

43:03.095 --> 43:05.296
Holy crap.

43:05.298 --> 43:08.198
That's Fleegle's Magic Shop.

43:08.200 --> 43:09.836
Oh, my gosh.

43:11.070 --> 43:13.303
FYI, the design
is loosely modeled

43:13.305 --> 43:16.006
of Davenport's Magic Shop
in London.

43:16.008 --> 43:19.079
This is like my whole childhood
right here.

43:21.014 --> 43:23.013
Babe, give me your phone.

43:30.356 --> 43:33.323
What's up, you guys?
It's your boy Thadd.

43:33.325 --> 43:36.394
Mr. Thadastic to all my fans.

43:36.396 --> 43:41.465
I'm here with the one
and only Miss Poppy Glarady

43:41.467 --> 43:45.001
and we're live on set
of "The Banana Splits."

43:45.003 --> 43:46.570
What up, everyone?

43:46.572 --> 43:49.106
We're alone
in Fleegle's Magic Shop.

43:49.108 --> 43:51.441
I can't even.

43:51.443 --> 43:54.313
Yo, check this out.
You're gonna love this.

44:02.488 --> 44:03.557
Hey, Pop?

44:05.925 --> 44:07.524
Thadd, no.

44:07.526 --> 44:09.861
Babe, I love you so much.

44:09.863 --> 44:12.229
'And I can't think
of a better place than this.'

44:12.231 --> 44:14.198
'Will you marry me?'

44:14.200 --> 44:15.466
Thadd, yes.

44:15.468 --> 44:17.968
Yo, she said yes!

44:17.970 --> 44:19.106
Oh.

44:33.919 --> 44:36.120
What the hell?

44:36.122 --> 44:37.558
Fleegle.

44:40.260 --> 44:42.062
We just got engaged.

44:43.528 --> 44:45.264
Hey.

44:51.169 --> 44:53.905
'Banana-cadabra!'

44:53.907 --> 44:56.274
- What the hell, man?
- Thadd, relax.

44:56.276 --> 44:58.212
I think he's just doing
a magic trick.

45:02.981 --> 45:04.550
What are you doing?

45:07.986 --> 45:09.287
Hey.

45:13.358 --> 45:15.992
- Poppy, please!
- Thadd.

45:15.994 --> 45:17.430
- Thadd!
- Let me out!

45:21.934 --> 45:23.934
Please let him out, please.

45:23.936 --> 45:25.468
No, please!

45:25.470 --> 45:28.638
No! Let him out. Please!

45:28.640 --> 45:30.474
Thadd. Thadd!

45:30.476 --> 45:32.008
- What's going on?
- 'No, please.'

45:32.010 --> 45:33.477
- Let me out.
- 'Thadd, please!'

45:33.479 --> 45:35.646
Let me out!

45:35.648 --> 45:37.615
No!

45:37.617 --> 45:40.017
'No!'

45:40.019 --> 45:41.551
- Poppy.
- 'No!'

45:41.553 --> 45:43.222
- Stop!
- Please.

45:45.224 --> 45:47.361
- Thadd!
- Aah!

45:49.963 --> 45:51.629
Thadd.

45:51.631 --> 45:53.330
'No!'

45:53.332 --> 45:55.198
'No, please.'

45:55.200 --> 45:58.234
No!

46:03.209 --> 46:05.412
Please don't make me. Please!

46:08.548 --> 46:10.284
No!

46:37.343 --> 46:39.376
Ta-da!

46:42.548 --> 46:45.282
No. No, please. No!

46:45.284 --> 46:47.954
Get off of me! Get off!

46:53.191 --> 46:56.126
Please, no!

46:56.128 --> 46:58.064
- No.
- 'Snorky?'

47:00.767 --> 47:03.370
'Here's the circus.
He's got to be here.'

47:16.715 --> 47:18.351
Fleegle!

47:22.789 --> 47:24.758
Do you know where Snorky is?

47:27.727 --> 47:29.593
Can you take us to him?

47:29.595 --> 47:31.698
Harley really
wants to meet Snorky.

47:45.811 --> 47:48.681
Come on. You wanna meet Snorky.
Don't ya?

48:18.244 --> 48:20.514
Oh, Kara, you are killing me.

49:24.543 --> 49:27.577
Daddy, I just wanna go home.

49:27.579 --> 49:30.713
Not until I get you
a real audition.

49:30.715 --> 49:34.318
We've worked too hard
to give up now. Hm?

49:34.320 --> 49:35.722
Come on.

49:46.932 --> 49:49.535
Are you ready to meet
your next superstar?

49:52.505 --> 49:54.872
Hey!

49:54.874 --> 49:56.974
I'm talking to you.

50:02.847 --> 50:04.847
Daddy, I'm scared.

50:04.849 --> 50:07.286
You don't have to be scared,
honey. It's just a puppet.

50:49.695 --> 50:51.762
Where is everybody?

50:51.764 --> 50:54.698
- They were all here.
- They're not with you?

50:54.700 --> 50:57.367
They're probably just exploring
the rest of the sets.

50:57.369 --> 50:59.470
- Harley! Zoe!
- Shit.

50:59.472 --> 51:02.573
Mom, uh, we'll find them.
It's fine.

51:02.575 --> 51:05.642
- You don't know that. Harley!
- Shit.

51:05.644 --> 51:07.644
- 'Zoe!'
- I promise, they're okay.

51:07.646 --> 51:09.379
Yeah, yeah, I know.

51:09.381 --> 51:11.383
My mom just..
She sometimes gets this way.

51:12.550 --> 51:15.285
We'll find them. Trust me.

51:15.287 --> 51:17.553
Can't even get off the lot
at this time of night.

51:17.555 --> 51:19.390
Somebody help me!

51:22.294 --> 51:24.563
Why are you doing this to me?

51:46.017 --> 51:49.722
Help! There's this psycho
tryin' to run me over!

51:52.090 --> 51:55.591
Oh, thank God.

51:55.593 --> 51:58.595
Hey.

51:58.597 --> 52:00.798
Did you hear me?

52:07.506 --> 52:08.705
'Mom,
Paige went to look for them.'

52:08.707 --> 52:10.774
She knows this place
better than anybody.

52:10.776 --> 52:13.343
I can't believe Harley
would just run off like that.

52:13.345 --> 52:14.711
You know him.
He's in his own world.

52:14.713 --> 52:16.446
He was probably just excited.

52:16.448 --> 52:17.983
If something happens to him, I..

52:19.852 --> 52:22.986
This is.. I don't, I don't know
if I can go through that again.

52:22.988 --> 52:24.887
We are at a taping
of "The Banana Splits."

52:24.889 --> 52:26.492
Nobody's gonna die.

52:29.662 --> 52:32.495
You weren't like this
when dad was alive.

52:32.497 --> 52:33.664
You were fearless.

52:33.666 --> 52:34.865
I watched him die

52:34.867 --> 52:36.367
and I couldn't stop it.

52:36.369 --> 52:38.102
It wasn't your fault.

52:38.104 --> 52:40.504
Bad things happen, you still..

52:40.506 --> 52:42.575
You know, we still need to live.

52:44.376 --> 52:48.379
I know that you think
I worry too much.

52:48.381 --> 52:50.414
'And that our life is boring,
but I..'

52:50.416 --> 52:52.852
I am just trying
to keep you guys all safe.

52:57.590 --> 52:58.955
Did you find them?

52:58.957 --> 53:00.858
Paige brought me up to speed
on the whole situation

53:00.860 --> 53:02.925
and I assure you
everything is under control.

53:08.700 --> 53:11.568
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

53:11.570 --> 53:14.604
God, it's that stage dad.

53:14.606 --> 53:16.840
Sir, can-can you hear me?
What happened?

53:16.842 --> 53:20.910
They attacked me.

53:20.912 --> 53:23.717
- Who did?
- Banana Splits.

53:24.983 --> 53:26.452
Paige, call 911.

53:27.952 --> 53:29.753
Go!

53:29.755 --> 53:31.053
There has to be an explanation.

53:31.055 --> 53:33.689
Th-the Banana Splits
don't hurt people.

53:39.865 --> 53:42.533
We have to get the kids.

53:42.535 --> 53:45.936
Uh, okay, just take..
Keep-keep breathing.

53:49.707 --> 53:51.508
What is this place?

53:51.510 --> 53:53.847
This must be where they were
built or something.

53:55.447 --> 53:57.416
Is Snorky in here?

54:00.186 --> 54:01.821
In there?

54:04.590 --> 54:06.392
This is weird.

54:11.063 --> 54:12.796
Hello? Snorky?

54:12.798 --> 54:14.700
Get me out of here!

54:18.037 --> 54:20.169
I brought friends.

54:28.680 --> 54:31.117
We're gonna have so much fun!

54:39.858 --> 54:42.194
Harley! Zoe!

54:44.095 --> 54:46.696
Mom, this is crazy, right?

54:46.698 --> 54:48.899
He loves this show.
Maybe he's hiding somewhere.

54:48.901 --> 54:50.233
He-he probably
doesn't wanna leave.

54:50.235 --> 54:51.602
Harley!

54:51.604 --> 54:53.604
Where are you?

54:53.606 --> 54:55.972
Come on. Come on, hurry.

54:55.974 --> 54:58.175
Harley! Zoe!

54:58.177 --> 54:59.609
Harley!

55:01.847 --> 55:03.917
- What's that noise?
- Bingo.

55:05.885 --> 55:07.149
'Mom!'

55:08.820 --> 55:10.122
Austin!

55:12.224 --> 55:14.561
Austin!

55:17.997 --> 55:19.896
Mom!

55:19.898 --> 55:21.867
Get out of here.

55:23.102 --> 55:24.637
Run!

55:42.320 --> 55:44.988
Time's almost up.

55:44.990 --> 55:46.256
For you.

56:04.642 --> 56:06.713
Mom,
that was seriously badass.

56:08.881 --> 56:10.817
Let's go find your brother.

56:24.729 --> 56:26.729
Oh, my God.

56:29.735 --> 56:31.704
He asked me to marry him.

56:33.805 --> 56:35.909
Mom, I think she's lost it.

56:38.876 --> 56:40.612
I'm so sorry.

56:44.082 --> 56:46.350
I'm looking for my son
and his friend.

56:46.352 --> 56:48.318
Have you seen them?

56:48.320 --> 56:50.720
- Fleegle took them.
- What?

56:50.722 --> 56:52.659
Where-where,
where did there go?

56:56.195 --> 56:58.260
Listen to me. Listen,
it's not safe here for you.

56:58.262 --> 57:00.631
You have to come with us, okay?

57:00.633 --> 57:02.265
I won't leave Thadd.

57:02.267 --> 57:05.001
I know how you feel. Trust me.

57:05.003 --> 57:07.206
He would not want anything bad
to happen to you.

57:08.807 --> 57:10.776
You have to come with us
right now.

57:41.740 --> 57:44.243
Hey, you gotta let us
out of here.

57:48.414 --> 57:50.713
- I can't.
- Of course, you can.

57:50.715 --> 57:52.749
Just unlock the gate.

57:52.751 --> 57:54.785
I tried to tell them
that it's wrong

57:54.787 --> 57:57.220
but they wouldn't listen.

57:57.222 --> 57:59.122
'Something went wrong
with my update.'

57:59.124 --> 58:01.425
They didn't listen to me now.

58:01.427 --> 58:04.227
This is all the network's fault.

58:04.229 --> 58:07.229
They shouldn't have taken away
their show.

58:07.231 --> 58:10.302
'Then none of
this would have happened.'

58:11.769 --> 58:15.271
This show is all they have.

58:20.345 --> 58:22.479
You built them, didn't you?

58:22.481 --> 58:25.251
- Yes.
- You love them, don't you?

58:27.218 --> 58:29.452
- Yes.
- I love them too.

58:29.454 --> 58:32.891
They're my favorite.
They make people happy.

58:34.325 --> 58:35.959
That's why I built them.

58:35.961 --> 58:38.195
But now they're hurting people.

58:38.197 --> 58:41.367
You can stop this, but you
have to let us out of here.

59:03.889 --> 59:06.055
Come on!

59:17.769 --> 59:19.104
Fleegle!

59:23.307 --> 59:26.178
My precious boy.
Who-who did this to you?

59:40.425 --> 59:43.492
Hi, kids.
Put on your hap-happiest faces

59:43.494 --> 59:46.331
because "The Banana Splits" show
is about to begin.

01:00:07.285 --> 01:00:09.789
'I can fix you. Wait.'

01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:14.124
Where do you think
you're going?

01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:26.872
Help! Ah!

01:00:29.474 --> 01:00:31.110
You'll never stop them!

01:00:33.044 --> 01:00:35.345
The show must go on!

01:00:35.347 --> 01:00:37.012
Everything's going to be okay.

01:00:37.014 --> 01:00:39.548
The, the ambulance
will be here soon.

01:00:39.550 --> 01:00:41.584
Where the hell are they?

01:00:46.157 --> 01:00:48.326
It's Sloppy Time!

01:00:49.494 --> 01:00:50.997
Oh, no.

01:00:54.365 --> 01:00:55.802
Stand down.

01:00:58.135 --> 01:01:00.236
I'm ordering you to stand down.

01:01:24.296 --> 01:01:25.495
No.

01:01:39.577 --> 01:01:41.111
Damn it.

01:02:31.229 --> 01:02:32.995
What's happening?

01:02:32.997 --> 01:02:35.198
We..

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.470
We have to run
the Sloppy Time course.

01:02:55.519 --> 01:02:57.454
- Oh, come on.
- Give me, give me your hand.

01:03:39.231 --> 01:03:42.068
Don't stop now.
You're almost there.

01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:51.077
We're gonna make it.

01:04:00.651 --> 01:04:02.420
Where's the blue key?

01:04:15.434 --> 01:04:17.503
It's time to fly!

01:04:24.508 --> 01:04:27.843
I, I did it.

01:04:27.845 --> 01:04:30.015
I did it.

01:04:31.682 --> 01:04:33.316
Don't hit the hammer.

01:04:36.387 --> 01:04:38.454
She did it!

01:04:38.456 --> 01:04:41.256
He took it down
to Hammer Town.

01:04:42.561 --> 01:04:44.861
Three cheers for Rebecca!

01:04:44.863 --> 01:04:47.162
'Hip hip hooray!'

01:05:03.682 --> 01:05:05.618
Which way do we go?

01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:17.329
It's locked.

01:05:22.434 --> 01:05:24.637
I'll take him out.
You guys run.

01:05:33.144 --> 01:05:36.114
What are you doing?
We can't trust him.

01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:39.584
It's Snorky. He's different.

This is some messed up stuff
right here.

01:06:18.822 --> 01:06:20.492
Please, Snorky.

01:06:22.793 --> 01:06:24.561
Help us.

01:06:39.311 --> 01:06:40.778

Hey, shh, don't worry.

01:08:19.611 --> 01:08:21.644
You scared the hell out of me.

01:08:21.645 --> 01:08:23.613
Are the police coming?

01:08:23.615 --> 01:08:24.779
No, the phones don't work

01:08:24.782 --> 01:08:26.515
and all the cell phones
were smashed.

01:08:26.518 --> 01:08:29.319
We have to find Fleegle.
They took Harley and Zoe.

01:08:29.321 --> 01:08:31.354
We have to stop them.

01:08:31.356 --> 01:08:33.788
There must be a way
to stop them.

01:08:33.791 --> 01:08:34.926
Karl.

01:08:36.661 --> 01:08:37.930
Come on.

01:08:50.375 --> 01:08:51.908
Yo! Shit.

01:08:53.678 --> 01:08:56.048
- Austin. Austin! Austin!
- Don't you touch him!

01:08:57.549 --> 01:08:58.984
Karl?

01:09:02.554 --> 01:09:03.984
How do we stop
the Banana Splits?

01:09:06.724 --> 01:09:08.390
You can't.

01:09:08.393 --> 01:09:09.890
You built them.
There must be a way.

01:09:09.893 --> 01:09:12.560
The show must go on.

01:09:12.563 --> 01:09:13.995
It's in their programming.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.036
They took my kids.

01:09:19.837 --> 01:09:21.904
Your children are safe.

01:09:21.906 --> 01:09:26.140
Mm, they're having
a wonderful time.

01:09:31.982 --> 01:09:33.551
Is that music?

01:09:37.755 --> 01:09:39.791
Sounds like it's coming
from down there.

01:09:42.826 --> 01:09:44.529
Help me move this.

01:09:50.468 --> 01:09:53.468
- What's down there?
- The show.

01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:06.919
Let's go.

01:10:17.929 --> 01:10:19.194
What is that?

01:10:19.196 --> 01:10:22.667
I was building a sister
for my boys.

01:10:23.634 --> 01:10:26.468
A fifth Banana Split?

01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:28.674
Her name is Hooty.

01:10:31.476 --> 01:10:33.445
We were gonna get married.

01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:40.619
But then they killed him.

01:10:52.129 --> 01:10:54.400
What are you doing?

01:10:56.567 --> 01:10:59.537
Stop that! It's not for you.

01:11:09.613 --> 01:11:12.013
'Stay back!'

01:11:15.586 --> 01:11:17.589
He's dead because of you.

01:11:31.936 --> 01:11:34.569
'Where's Poppy?
She was right behind me.'

01:11:34.571 --> 01:11:36.641
'She'll catch up. Come on.'

01:12:33.063 --> 01:12:35.730
What, uh, what is that
in his eyes?

01:12:35.732 --> 01:12:37.900
Bing-Bingo's drumsticks.

01:12:37.902 --> 01:12:39.601
It's Doug. The other page.

01:12:39.603 --> 01:12:41.807
They sent him out
with the rest of the audience.

01:12:47.778 --> 01:12:50.648
- Oh, Jesus.
- It's only the adults.

01:12:54.686 --> 01:12:57.052
Where are the children?

01:13:00.791 --> 01:13:02.059
Let's go.

01:13:28.251 --> 01:13:31.119
Ta-da!

01:13:34.692 --> 01:13:36.962
Well, who could that be?

01:13:49.874 --> 01:13:52.644
Look who I found.
It's Stevie.

01:13:53.777 --> 01:13:54.810
What the hell is this?

01:13:54.812 --> 01:13:56.712
Isn't it wonderful, Stevie?

01:13:56.714 --> 01:13:58.814
All of our friends are here.

01:13:58.816 --> 01:14:00.382
Now the show can go on

01:14:00.384 --> 01:14:04.188
'forever and ever and ever!'

01:14:05.689 --> 01:14:07.789
They're never gonna let them go.

01:14:07.791 --> 01:14:10.092
They'll die in here.

01:14:10.094 --> 01:14:11.761
We have to save those kids.

01:14:25.876 --> 01:14:29.214
Hey, Stevie. Mail's here!

01:14:43.061 --> 01:14:44.793
Shh.

01:14:55.238 --> 01:14:56.971
Silly Stevie.

01:14:56.973 --> 01:15:00.943
Smoking's bad for your health.

01:15:00.945 --> 01:15:04.148
- I can't see Harley or Zoe.
- Maybe they got away.

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:12.721
Oh, boy, it's time for..

01:15:12.723 --> 01:15:15.427
- The wheel of endings.
- The wheel of endings.

01:15:33.277 --> 01:15:35.714
I'm the vice president
of Programming.

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:39.448
You can't do this to me.

01:15:39.450 --> 01:15:41.449
We have to hurry.

01:15:46.256 --> 01:15:48.923
I wonder
how the show is gonna end.

01:15:54.965 --> 01:15:56.168
Guys.

01:15:58.068 --> 01:15:59.470
Take it slow.

01:16:11.281 --> 01:16:13.516
Oh, my God.

01:16:13.518 --> 01:16:16.185
Great job, Snorky.

01:16:16.187 --> 01:16:18.457
Put them
with our other friends.

01:16:25.897 --> 01:16:28.830
You can't do this.
You're the Banana Splits.

01:16:28.832 --> 01:16:31.103
The show must go on.

01:16:37.942 --> 01:16:40.212
Snorky, please don't do this.

01:17:07.437 --> 01:17:10.940
Banana split!

01:17:10.942 --> 01:17:13.278
What, what's a banana split?

01:17:14.978 --> 01:17:17.312
What's a banana split?

01:17:17.314 --> 01:17:18.980
- What's a banana split?
- I don't know.

01:17:18.982 --> 01:17:21.283
It always lands on rock out.

01:17:26.122 --> 01:17:27.422
Mom.

01:17:27.424 --> 01:17:28.891
Everybody, close your eyes.

01:17:28.893 --> 01:17:30.292
'Close your eyes!
Don't watch this.'

01:18:13.437 --> 01:18:14.906
Come on, guys.

01:18:18.142 --> 01:18:20.008
Austin, Paige,
take the kids out.

01:18:20.010 --> 01:18:21.243
Go.

01:18:24.180 --> 01:18:25.280
I'm not gonna leave you behind.

01:18:25.282 --> 01:18:27.917
Grab Harley and Zoey and go.

01:18:27.919 --> 01:18:29.618
Go!

01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:31.352
Come on.

01:18:40.997 --> 01:18:42.931
Come on, you fuzzy son of bitch.

01:19:22.339 --> 01:19:25.209
Drooper, mail's here.

01:19:27.244 --> 01:19:29.347
- No, no, no, no, no!
- 'Hey!'

01:19:34.151 --> 01:19:36.150
- Mom.
- I told you to leave.

01:19:36.152 --> 01:19:38.252
I'm not leaving you.

01:19:38.254 --> 01:19:39.587
No!

01:20:01.679 --> 01:20:03.348
Mom!

01:20:10.388 --> 01:20:12.557
Banana-cadabra, bitch!

01:20:31.741 --> 01:20:34.543
This show is really not
what I expected.

01:20:37.313 --> 01:20:38.749
Come on, let's go.

01:20:45.555 --> 01:20:50.628
♪ Tra la la la.. ♪♪

01:21:06.277 --> 01:21:08.177
Zoe!

01:21:08.179 --> 01:21:10.482
- Hey, it's Harley.
- Oh, they're okay.

01:21:24.128 --> 01:21:26.528
Time's almost up.

01:22:18.749 --> 01:22:19.847
'Snorky!'

01:22:35.866 --> 01:22:37.431
Snorky!

01:22:37.433 --> 01:22:38.869
Harley, no!

01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:44.373
Snorky.

01:22:45.442 --> 01:22:47.543
You will always be my favorite.

01:23:13.437 --> 01:23:14.836
- Mom?
- Yeah.

01:23:14.838 --> 01:23:16.637
Can I go to acting class?

01:23:16.639 --> 01:23:18.610
Anything you want, my darling.

01:23:22.513 --> 01:23:25.314
- Here you go, honey.
- Thank you.

01:23:25.316 --> 01:23:26.448
I'll be right back,
okay, guys?

01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:27.284
Okay.

01:23:29.353 --> 01:23:31.919
You know, you're not
as weird as I thought.

01:23:31.921 --> 01:23:34.489
This show is weird.
I'm awesome.

01:23:34.491 --> 01:23:36.194
Yeah. You are.

01:23:39.530 --> 01:23:43.832
So, um, I was kind of wondering
after everything that happened

01:23:43.834 --> 01:23:47.938
maybe, um, you could, um,
give me your number?

01:23:56.647 --> 01:23:58.346
'Beth.'

01:23:58.348 --> 01:24:00.548
Honey.

01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:02.486
I got, I got hit by a car.

01:24:04.455 --> 01:24:06.421
It was awful.

01:24:06.423 --> 01:24:08.390
But it made me realize
something.

01:24:08.392 --> 01:24:10.929
I don't wanna be with Kara.
I want you.

01:24:12.996 --> 01:24:14.698
I love you, Beth.

01:24:20.571 --> 01:24:22.307
I want a divorce.
