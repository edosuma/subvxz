WEBVTT

00:00.578 --> 00:01.914
Previously on Gotham...

00:02.078 --> 00:03.977
- The Doc, you know 'em?
- Oh, I know The Doc.

00:04.080 --> 00:05.723
Sometimes we search for things

00:05.748 --> 00:07.523
we don't wish to find.
Doc! Doc!

00:07.547 --> 00:10.251
- I enjoy being the queen of Gotham.
- Glad we understand each other.

00:10.275 --> 00:11.808
There are other ways

00:11.833 --> 00:12.999
for me to hurt you.

00:13.125 --> 00:14.938
Something's eating at you,
Jim, and you're not gonna

00:14.962 --> 00:16.711
feel clean till you
get it off your chest.

00:18.113 --> 00:19.146
That's done now.

00:19.459 --> 00:21.058
I'm at Sofia Falcone's.

00:21.160 --> 00:22.526
I just shot and killed the Pyg.

00:22.629 --> 00:24.531
I see Arkham's treating you well.

00:24.556 --> 00:27.308
- Good-bye, Oswald.
- I am held captive,

00:27.333 --> 00:28.444
all my brilliance locked away.

00:28.468 --> 00:30.167
You're still there.

00:30.192 --> 00:31.883
And you're gonna help me
find a way out of here.

00:31.907 --> 00:33.375
- I need a name.
- Ivy Pepper.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.901
- I know Ivy.
- No she's changed, like, a lot.

00:37.243 --> 00:38.254
Called Lazarus Water.

00:38.278 --> 00:39.598
What are you going to do with it?

00:40.141 --> 00:42.250
I'm going to make miracles happen.

00:43.328 --> 00:45.897
Reel it in a little? Or
should I call your keeper?

00:45.922 --> 00:47.303
Call Alfred. He won't answer.

00:47.405 --> 00:49.054
- Why?
- 'Cause I fired him.

01:45.484 --> 01:46.928
Where is the other guy who works here?

01:46.952 --> 01:48.163
You mean Harvey?

01:48.188 --> 01:51.189
He's out sick. You
want to leave a message?

01:56.762 --> 01:58.210
I do.

02:00.532 --> 02:02.210
All right. What should I say?

02:02.371 --> 02:04.038
Nothing.

02:04.692 --> 02:08.295
Because all of you, with your blood

02:08.473 --> 02:12.281
and your flesh and
what you will become...

02:14.070 --> 02:16.737
...you are the message.

02:36.768 --> 02:38.398
He was a good man.

02:39.273 --> 02:40.882
It doesn't matter that Mario is gone.

02:40.907 --> 02:42.907
You'll always be my sister.

02:43.118 --> 02:45.151
For Falcones, it's all about family.

02:45.667 --> 02:47.203
I appreciate that.

02:48.085 --> 02:50.062
So, sister to sister,

02:50.682 --> 02:52.843
we're not really here
to look at photographs.

02:55.992 --> 02:57.654
There's only one neighborhood in Gotham

02:57.679 --> 02:59.046
that hasn't bent the knee.

02:59.398 --> 03:01.804
The Narrows has never
submitted to an outside boss.

03:01.829 --> 03:04.281
There's never been someone
like me ruling Gotham.

03:05.062 --> 03:06.396
Okay.

03:06.498 --> 03:07.731
What do you want?

03:07.833 --> 03:09.399
A tax.

03:09.501 --> 03:11.624
30% on all income
coming from the Narrows,

03:11.649 --> 03:13.578
legal and illegal.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.631
Every family there lives hand
to mouth. They'll starve.

03:17.909 --> 03:19.999
We all have to make sacrifices.

03:20.923 --> 03:22.755
I'll need an answer
by the end of the day.

03:27.889 --> 03:30.593
You want me to kiss the ring,
I'll do it to keep the peace,

03:30.618 --> 03:32.890
but what you're asking
for is impossible.

03:34.646 --> 03:36.093
You'll find a way.

03:37.882 --> 03:39.703
Thought it was all about family.

03:41.619 --> 03:43.538
Never said it was a happy family.

03:52.384 --> 03:53.749
Thank you.

04:07.986 --> 04:09.501
Thank you for meeting me.

04:14.595 --> 04:16.635
My parents' foundation is having
their annual dinner tonight.

04:16.659 --> 04:17.642
I thought we'd go.

04:17.666 --> 04:19.635
Somehow, I don't think you
called me all the way down here

04:19.659 --> 04:21.899
to talk about a fundraiser, did you?

04:23.931 --> 04:26.095
Bruce, what exactly...

04:26.120 --> 04:27.939
is it that you want from me?

04:33.725 --> 04:34.964
Help.

04:36.425 --> 04:38.732
Figuring this out. I can't do it alone.

04:38.757 --> 04:39.823
I...

04:41.073 --> 04:42.745
Alfred, I need your help.

04:48.220 --> 04:49.389
No.

04:53.053 --> 04:54.092
What?

04:54.117 --> 04:56.593
Listen, you can't just waltz
back in here and expect me

04:56.618 --> 04:58.852
to go and clean your
smalls and cook your tea,

04:58.877 --> 05:00.796
- after what you've done.
- Alfred, I'm not asking for that.

05:00.820 --> 05:02.796
- I've changed.
- Oh, you have, have you?

05:02.821 --> 05:05.060
See, it's one thing
saying that you've changed

05:05.085 --> 05:06.522
and another actually changing.

05:06.547 --> 05:08.858
So... show me.

05:09.853 --> 05:13.061
Show me how you've
changed, I might reconsider.

05:15.774 --> 05:17.358
Show you how?

05:20.984 --> 05:22.513
Well...

05:24.235 --> 05:26.255
that's for you to figure out, isn't it?

05:31.886 --> 05:34.919
I'm asking... as a friend.

05:34.944 --> 05:37.263
I am not... your friend.

05:39.025 --> 05:40.857
I was your butler.

05:42.159 --> 05:44.125
And you fired me.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.349
He'll pay for the tea, miss.

06:00.857 --> 06:03.802
Sure hope Lee is gonna figure
something out with Sofia.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.564
Lee being the love of your life and all.

06:06.263 --> 06:07.677
We're friends.

06:08.184 --> 06:09.547
You know, those cuckoo pills

06:09.572 --> 06:10.903
aren't gonna make me go away.

06:12.169 --> 06:14.248
Well, they have stopped
you from getting out

06:14.273 --> 06:17.537
and trying to kill Lee
again, so works for me!

06:18.838 --> 06:20.171
Mail arrived.

06:24.115 --> 06:25.576
Oh, who's it from?

06:26.156 --> 06:27.591
Oswald.

06:27.860 --> 06:29.993
"I want to apologize."

06:30.548 --> 06:32.482
"Can we be friends again?" What?

06:32.584 --> 06:34.404
What is he... I'm
never gonna forgive him.

06:34.429 --> 06:36.177
Oh, I think it's a nice letter.

06:36.202 --> 06:38.906
- Oh, shut up!
- Hey, Ed.

06:39.189 --> 06:41.056
What has two eyes but can't see?

06:42.388 --> 06:48.740
What has two...?

06:53.359 --> 06:56.529
Good Lord. This is new.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.353
More aggressive.

06:59.097 --> 07:01.560
Plants are literally
bursting through their flesh.

07:04.188 --> 07:06.830
You! Get away from that now.

07:06.978 --> 07:08.144
Now.

07:08.504 --> 07:11.541
Same flower growing out of these bodies.

07:11.959 --> 07:13.058
That's a weapon?

07:13.083 --> 07:14.821
Gordon.

07:14.971 --> 07:17.407
This must be what Ivy did
with the Lazarus Water.

07:17.432 --> 07:19.564
Used it to increase the
potency of a toxic plant.

07:19.589 --> 07:21.643
- The seeds made it airborne...
- Where's Bullock?

07:21.668 --> 07:23.494
- What?
- He works here.

07:24.481 --> 07:26.650
Harvey killed Ivy's father.

07:32.379 --> 07:33.511
Clear.

07:35.697 --> 07:38.334
- Too late.
- No, we're not.

07:38.436 --> 07:39.802
Hey!

07:39.904 --> 07:41.338
Hey!

07:41.363 --> 07:44.164
Aah! Damn it, Jim!

07:44.475 --> 07:46.010
Jim, what the hell?!

07:46.035 --> 07:49.035
- Hey, someone's paying for that door!
- Ivy Pepper.

07:49.681 --> 07:50.502
Who?

07:50.527 --> 07:53.510
Mario Pepper's kid... she's
been working on some biotech.

07:53.584 --> 07:55.518
She attacked your bar.

07:55.697 --> 07:57.182
It's bad.

07:57.397 --> 07:59.196
Donnie, the bartender?

08:00.307 --> 08:03.362
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, God.

08:03.553 --> 08:07.166
Look, I got to think
that you were the target.

08:07.243 --> 08:09.143
Jim, I only shot Ivy Pepper's dad

08:09.168 --> 08:11.778
because I was saving your stupid hide!

08:11.803 --> 08:13.670
- You can't put this on me!
- Guys.

08:13.695 --> 08:15.394
- I'm not putting it on you!
- Guys!

08:15.419 --> 08:17.066
In the interest of public
safety, we have decided

08:17.090 --> 08:18.756
to share the footage, so in a moment,

08:18.781 --> 08:20.565
the video we are about to show you

08:20.590 --> 08:23.290
is from a tape received this morning.

08:23.315 --> 08:26.726
And again, let me warn
you, it is very disturbing.

08:28.687 --> 08:30.877
Plants love us.

08:30.902 --> 08:33.962
They give us food, shelter,

08:34.211 --> 08:36.229
the very air we breathe.

08:37.349 --> 08:39.221
And what do we do in return?

08:40.519 --> 08:41.995
Kill them.

08:42.746 --> 08:44.420
Because that's our nature.

08:46.099 --> 08:48.299
We cause pain.

08:50.599 --> 08:56.108
Everyone I've known has
only hurt or betrayed me.

08:56.723 --> 09:00.024
Maybe I've always known in
my heart what I needed to do.

09:00.233 --> 09:03.303
But I finally have the power to do so.

09:05.040 --> 09:08.074
I'm giving your city back to the plants,

09:08.379 --> 09:10.703
starting with the people who hurt me.

09:11.596 --> 09:13.490
So if that's you...

09:14.811 --> 09:16.511
your time is coming.

09:18.281 --> 09:21.078
- Guess we know what she's up to.
- Yeah.

09:21.103 --> 09:23.103
She's gonna kill everyone in Gotham.

09:23.451 --> 09:24.984
Starting with me.

09:27.680 --> 09:30.181
Preliminary reports indicate
that similar takes

09:30.206 --> 09:32.373
have been delivered to
multiple news organizations...

09:34.390 --> 09:37.618
Wait a minute. What's that there?

09:38.445 --> 09:40.195
"Sully's Eatery."

09:40.220 --> 09:43.221
That's in Ives Square.
House must be right across.

09:43.323 --> 09:44.727
You should go to the precinct.

09:44.752 --> 09:46.829
Hey, I'm not hiding like
some freaking coward.

09:46.854 --> 09:50.061
All right? Four people are
dead because she wanted me.

09:50.240 --> 09:53.297
Okay. Then we'll work on it together.
You can wear the badge.

09:53.322 --> 09:56.278
Get this straight, Jim! I ain't
working for you now or ever.

09:56.602 --> 09:59.147
I got more contacts in the
Narrows than any of you.

09:59.531 --> 10:02.465
I'm gonna find her, alone.

10:06.259 --> 10:08.521
Once I find my pants.

10:12.919 --> 10:14.919
Doesn't make any sense.

10:16.537 --> 10:18.089
There's no money here.

10:18.191 --> 10:20.060
Okay, so it's about power.

10:21.231 --> 10:23.193
I offered to bend the knee.

10:25.482 --> 10:28.789
She's asking for something
she knew I couldn't give.

10:29.697 --> 10:31.367
She wants...

10:32.492 --> 10:34.525
She wants to punish me.

10:35.041 --> 10:36.297
For what?

10:36.435 --> 10:39.354
I don't know, but you
can't fight an enemy

10:39.379 --> 10:41.945
whose motivations you
don't understand, Lee.

10:47.562 --> 10:52.156
You... are the greatest
spies in all of Gotham.

10:52.503 --> 10:54.976
You have eyes and ears everywhere.

10:55.394 --> 11:00.569
The survival of the
Narrows depends upon you!

11:03.187 --> 11:05.194
Whoever learns why Sofia Falcone

11:05.219 --> 11:07.929
wants to destroy Lee
Thompkins will receive...

11:09.109 --> 11:11.209
a complete set of encyclopedias.

11:11.311 --> 11:12.741
Minus the "T."

11:16.433 --> 11:19.261
- Plus 20 bucks.
- Yeah! Yes!

11:19.394 --> 11:20.960
Go get 'em.

11:33.167 --> 11:34.547
She wasn't bluffing.

11:34.863 --> 11:36.021
With this many plants,

11:36.046 --> 11:38.126
she could kill hundreds,
if not thousands, of people.

11:39.113 --> 11:41.550
Search the other room for any
signs of where she's heading.

11:52.169 --> 11:53.824
What are you gonna do to her?

11:55.199 --> 11:56.598
Where is she?

11:56.785 --> 11:58.027
I don't know.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.590
I just saw the news.

12:00.961 --> 12:02.723
She killed four more people today.

12:03.140 --> 12:04.637
You knew where she was staying.

12:04.662 --> 12:05.794
If you had told me,

12:06.209 --> 12:08.191
- we could've saved lives.
- Or not.

12:08.590 --> 12:09.872
I mean, you couldn't even stop her

12:09.896 --> 12:11.862
from hypnotizing your own cops.

12:13.082 --> 12:14.879
So why'd you come here?

12:17.073 --> 12:20.066
- To try to reason with her.
- Have you heard a word she said?

12:20.091 --> 12:22.285
- She's a fanatic.
- She's my friend.

12:23.028 --> 12:25.094
I mean, what do you expect me to do?

12:25.119 --> 12:27.820
She contacts you again, call me.

12:28.054 --> 12:30.691
I'll try and find her
and bring her in quietly.

12:30.827 --> 12:33.394
Otherwise, stay out of her way.

12:35.696 --> 12:38.769
- Harvey?
- Hey.

12:38.948 --> 12:41.637
- I got a lead.
- Great.

12:45.078 --> 12:48.396
I knocked some heads, heard a
hot redhead was poking around

12:48.421 --> 12:50.087
in that dive bar next door.

12:50.135 --> 12:52.613
That is the place in the
Narrows for low-end muscle,

12:52.638 --> 12:54.551
so I figured if she was
planning something big,

12:54.576 --> 12:56.410
she might've gone there to recruit.

12:56.435 --> 12:59.508
That's the back entrance.
That's where my contact said that...

13:03.314 --> 13:04.855
Hello, Detective Gordon.

13:04.880 --> 13:06.262
On the ground, now.

13:06.287 --> 13:08.254
Harvey, call it in.

13:08.993 --> 13:11.168
She's beautiful, don't you think, Jim?

13:12.921 --> 13:14.590
Drop your weapon.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.160
You don't look good.

13:23.608 --> 13:26.074
Think you might be exceeding
your recommended dosage.

13:26.251 --> 13:28.051
Are you experiencing...

13:28.076 --> 13:31.077
"trembling extremities"? Check.

13:31.693 --> 13:33.949
"Cognitive impairment"? Definite check.

13:33.974 --> 13:36.722
Though, to be fair, how would you know?

13:36.747 --> 13:37.913
Shut up!

13:38.158 --> 13:40.992
Take all the pills you want,
Ed. I'm only getting stronger.

13:41.017 --> 13:42.951
Soon, I'm gonna be out,

13:43.474 --> 13:46.051
- and the fun begins!
- No.

13:46.076 --> 13:48.394
I won't let you, 'cause
I know what you'll do.

13:48.419 --> 13:50.183
Oh, you mean kill Lee?

13:50.544 --> 13:52.344
Yeah, I guess I will do that.

13:52.855 --> 13:54.089
And you can't stop me.

13:54.114 --> 13:56.686
- There are things that I can do.
- Like what?

13:56.836 --> 13:58.308
You need to face it, pal.

13:58.333 --> 14:01.367
The only way you'll get rid
of me is to kill yourself.

14:04.362 --> 14:06.441
I guess you are smarter than me.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.683
- You wouldn't actually...
- Oh, yeah.

14:13.532 --> 14:15.499
Oh, yeah.

14:16.418 --> 14:18.832
I said drop the gun, Jim.

14:26.105 --> 14:29.006
Do you believe in
fate, Detective Gordon?

14:29.084 --> 14:31.551
I went out today to test my plants

14:31.576 --> 14:33.643
on the man who shot my father.

14:34.259 --> 14:35.858
He wasn't there.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.324
It was disappointing.

14:39.363 --> 14:41.676
Then, he found me,

14:42.381 --> 14:46.715
and I realized I could make
him deliver his partner as well.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.606
Fate.

14:49.631 --> 14:51.742
Stay strong, Harvey.
She's controlling you.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.258
I kind of like it, Jim.

14:53.661 --> 14:55.211
Sweet surrender.

14:55.862 --> 14:58.875
You need help, Ivy. Let me find Selina.

14:58.900 --> 15:00.781
- She wants to help you.
- Quiet.

15:01.945 --> 15:03.390
I have to go.

15:03.642 --> 15:05.742
Big plans tonight.
Lots of people to kill.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.625
- Detective Bullock?
- Ma'am?

15:08.650 --> 15:10.320
After you kill your partner,

15:10.697 --> 15:12.554
be sure to shoot yourself
in the head, okay?

15:12.579 --> 15:13.937
Copy that.

15:21.664 --> 15:24.148
Harvey... Don't even try and
talk your way out of this!

15:24.173 --> 15:25.273
I wouldn't.

15:25.414 --> 15:27.714
But... quick question.

15:28.512 --> 15:31.000
Is Ivy's hair more auburn or scarlet?

15:32.632 --> 15:35.109
I, um... That's a good Que...

15:41.471 --> 15:44.562
Think I didn't come prepared? Huh?

15:45.797 --> 15:47.984
You always underestimate me.

15:49.484 --> 15:51.570
That's not why I'm shooting you.

15:51.758 --> 15:55.015
I just think we should,
uh... clear the air.

15:56.167 --> 15:58.725
What do you want to
talk about? I'm all ears.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.523
How you stole my job, for starters!

16:03.678 --> 16:06.226
Was it really your job, though?

16:06.251 --> 16:08.930
I mean, you only got it
'cause one captain died,

16:08.955 --> 16:11.622
- and the other one went nuts.
- Like hell!

16:12.066 --> 16:14.891
I paid my dues! I earned that
job, and you took it!

16:14.916 --> 16:18.000
You mean like the time
you gut-shot Officer Patel?

16:18.820 --> 16:21.836
That was... a mistake.

16:21.861 --> 16:24.390
Hey, give yourself some credit.

16:24.508 --> 16:26.734
Did shoot her from across the room.

16:26.759 --> 16:29.336
Although you couldn't
face her later, remember?

16:29.956 --> 16:32.765
You didn't have the courage to
meet her the next day, did you?

16:34.460 --> 16:36.404
- You coward.
- Screw you!

16:58.172 --> 16:59.132
We're not open.

16:59.157 --> 17:01.032
- I wanted to see you.
- Why? Because you weren't

17:01.056 --> 17:03.290
big enough of an ass
the last time I saw you?

17:03.602 --> 17:06.303
Selina... I don't have
time for this, Bruce.

17:06.994 --> 17:08.444
Something happened.

17:08.790 --> 17:11.452
- I need to talk to someone.
- Okay, then go find Alfred.

17:14.044 --> 17:15.741
Oh.

17:15.877 --> 17:17.042
You did.

17:17.311 --> 17:19.499
And he wanted nothing to do with you.

17:20.897 --> 17:22.421
Smart guy, Alfred.

17:24.531 --> 17:25.711
Will you at least hear me out?

17:25.734 --> 17:27.810
No, Bruce, because Ivy's
out there killing people,

17:27.836 --> 17:29.266
and I need to find her and stop her.

17:29.290 --> 17:31.132
So whatever problem you have

17:31.157 --> 17:33.710
going on right now, you
need to figure it out.

17:33.935 --> 17:36.002
I mean, say sorry to Alfred.

17:36.896 --> 17:39.562
'Cause I'm sure whatever
happened was your fault.

17:47.918 --> 17:49.860
According to my spies,

17:50.554 --> 17:54.532
Sofia and Jim were
carrying on an affair,

17:55.285 --> 17:57.318
till Jim ended it.

17:57.408 --> 17:59.274
So, technically,

17:59.544 --> 18:00.911
your ex has been sleeping with

18:00.936 --> 18:03.336
- your dead husband's mafiosa sister...
- Okay, Ed, I get it.

18:06.758 --> 18:09.204
If Sofia was sleeping with
the captain of the GCPD,

18:09.229 --> 18:10.610
it was a power play.

18:11.258 --> 18:12.946
And it failed.

18:13.511 --> 18:15.157
I'm her next step.

18:17.114 --> 18:19.321
Why don't I just give
her what she wants:

18:19.757 --> 18:21.735
power over Jim Gordon.

18:23.254 --> 18:24.946
You would do that?

18:25.385 --> 18:28.227
I'm not trying to get back
at Jim, though he deserves it.

18:28.973 --> 18:30.383
My job is to make sure

18:30.408 --> 18:32.133
that the people of the Narrows are safe,

18:32.158 --> 18:34.743
and I will do everything
in my power to ensure that.

18:40.274 --> 18:41.938
What?

18:42.259 --> 18:43.617
Lee...

18:43.642 --> 18:44.876
I...

18:48.943 --> 18:50.399
I, uh...

18:53.497 --> 18:55.464
I have to leave.

19:07.123 --> 19:08.423
Harvey. Harvey, come on.

19:08.731 --> 19:10.231
- Hey, come on.
- Okay. Whoa. Whoa.

19:10.256 --> 19:11.269
Where am I?

19:11.294 --> 19:14.028
You were hypnotized.
I need you to focus.

19:14.053 --> 19:16.637
Did Ivy give you any clue
about who she's targeting next?

19:16.662 --> 19:18.317
I can't believe I let her get to me.

19:18.342 --> 19:19.457
Hey, you want to help?

19:19.482 --> 19:21.168
Here's how. Did she say anything?

19:22.768 --> 19:24.450
Something about, uh,

19:24.475 --> 19:26.609
"They get rich by murdering plants"?

19:27.238 --> 19:30.139
So she's targeting a
group of rich people?

19:30.942 --> 19:32.293
At her place,

19:32.318 --> 19:35.239
she was trying on fancy
clothes, fancy shoes.

19:35.348 --> 19:36.551
A party?

19:36.576 --> 19:37.684
She said she had big plans,

19:37.709 --> 19:38.989
- couldn't be late.
- Come on.

19:40.290 --> 19:42.365
- Yeah, black tie. Fancy-schmancy.
- No, no, no. Come on.

19:42.389 --> 19:44.700
You know, like a charity
for hobos or something.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.020
Wayne Foundation's
annual dinner is tonight,

19:47.305 --> 19:48.793
over at Gotham Square.

19:48.818 --> 19:50.301
All right. Get the Strike Force.

19:50.326 --> 19:53.129
I want full body armor,
gas masks, nonlethal rounds.

19:54.278 --> 19:57.239
- T-To fight plants?
- When Ivy got me, she was hypnotizing

19:57.264 --> 20:00.100
- a bunch of low-end muscle.
- Go.

20:04.817 --> 20:06.707
Could really use you there, Harv.

20:07.217 --> 20:09.153
Jim, she got in my head.

20:09.604 --> 20:12.246
I really, I just don't
trust myself right now.

20:12.271 --> 20:14.037
All right. You can help out here.

20:14.062 --> 20:15.497
Man the phones.

20:19.950 --> 20:21.395
Hey, Jim.

20:23.874 --> 20:26.543
I spent too long
putting this all on you.

20:27.281 --> 20:29.434
What happened between us.

20:31.280 --> 20:33.645
Fact is, I only got myself to blame.

20:38.093 --> 20:39.522
I'll call.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.014
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

21:04.039 --> 21:09.276
please welcome to the
stage our host, Bruce Wayne.

21:22.304 --> 21:23.788
Good evening.

21:24.826 --> 21:26.952
Welcome to the third annual dinner

21:26.977 --> 21:29.514
for the Thomas and
Martha Wayne Foundation.

21:30.370 --> 21:33.569
This year, we disbursed $4 million in...

21:38.524 --> 21:40.186
Um...

21:41.958 --> 21:47.123
Uh, we-we disbursed
$4 million, and, uh...

22:01.604 --> 22:04.110
My parents spent their
lives helping people.

22:07.395 --> 22:08.821
I was so proud of them,

22:08.846 --> 22:10.891
and I always wanted
them to be proud of me.

22:16.615 --> 22:18.493
And then I saw them get murdered.

22:21.024 --> 22:23.922
I survived because someone
in my life kept me going

22:26.068 --> 22:27.719
He's been everything to me.

22:29.875 --> 22:31.305
A teacher.

22:31.924 --> 22:33.657
A protector.

22:36.586 --> 22:38.313
He's been a father to me.

22:41.673 --> 22:45.595
I hope... I hope he can see that.

22:48.966 --> 22:51.009
And give me another chance.

22:53.979 --> 22:55.509
Thank you.

23:07.532 --> 23:09.212
Thank you.

23:10.722 --> 23:12.244
That meant a great deal.

23:13.990 --> 23:15.681
But I can't help you.

23:17.394 --> 23:21.087
Not until you accept who you really are.

23:23.018 --> 23:25.572
I know who I am. I've
seen what's inside me.

23:25.597 --> 23:27.728
Darkness and anger.

23:27.974 --> 23:29.908
But what's beneath that?

23:30.756 --> 23:32.823
It's a heart that feels pain.

23:32.848 --> 23:36.439
Your heart, it's what makes
you want to help other people.

23:36.552 --> 23:38.775
Your heart is your strength.

23:40.459 --> 23:43.679
Deny the darkness and you deny that.

23:44.805 --> 23:46.679
But accepting that is something

23:46.704 --> 23:48.788
that you must do on your
own. Do you understand me?

23:53.031 --> 23:55.304
I was stupid for reaching out.

24:01.327 --> 24:02.667
That was quite a speech.

24:03.245 --> 24:04.683
Hello, all.

24:06.600 --> 24:08.700
I'm Ivy Pepper.

24:08.725 --> 24:11.475
No, no, no. Please.

24:11.500 --> 24:12.866
Stay seated.

24:27.990 --> 24:29.089
Can I just say...

24:30.100 --> 24:32.033
this is crazy!

24:32.810 --> 24:36.073
Well, this whole thing was your idea.

24:36.951 --> 24:39.825
And you're the smart one,
as you always tell me.

24:39.850 --> 24:41.483
Oh, very funny.

24:42.505 --> 24:43.654
Okay, fine!

24:43.679 --> 24:46.280
Fine! You win!

24:46.667 --> 24:50.392
- What?
- You... win.

24:50.494 --> 24:53.638
You beat me. Is that
what you want to hear?

24:54.150 --> 24:56.050
That is very nice.

24:56.982 --> 24:58.576
But I still have to do it.

24:59.061 --> 25:00.093
Wait!

25:00.231 --> 25:01.713
Wait. Wait.

25:02.138 --> 25:03.572
What if there's a way

25:03.674 --> 25:05.774
to do this where nobody gets hurt?

25:06.591 --> 25:08.560
- I don't believe you.
- So you're just gonna

25:08.585 --> 25:10.451
kill yourself without hearing me out?

25:12.577 --> 25:14.444
I'm telling you, Ed, there is a way

25:14.469 --> 25:17.271
to save Lee without killing yourself!

25:18.967 --> 25:20.614
Or killing us.

25:24.607 --> 25:25.925
I'm listening.

25:29.590 --> 25:32.885
Aren't these crimson flowers lovely?

25:39.281 --> 25:41.057
You're a handsome man.

25:42.046 --> 25:44.073
But you want more from life.

25:44.548 --> 25:45.956
I can feel it.

25:54.888 --> 25:56.888
Bruce! Is Ivy Pepper in there?

25:57.201 --> 25:59.644
Ivy? No. I mean, I didn't see her.

26:01.294 --> 26:03.496
Get out of here. Let's go!

26:05.725 --> 26:08.492
Breach that door!

26:18.582 --> 26:19.996
We...

26:20.021 --> 26:22.465
are going to turn this room into

26:22.759 --> 26:26.461
the most gorgeous garden
the world has ever seen.

26:28.293 --> 26:29.925
All you have to do...

26:30.827 --> 26:33.730
is take a deep... breath.

26:36.152 --> 26:37.666
Ah.

26:38.033 --> 26:40.099
A volunteer.

26:42.331 --> 26:44.532
GCPD! GCPD!

26:45.861 --> 26:47.894
Drop your guns on the ground now!

26:50.614 --> 26:51.988
Kill everyone.

27:03.090 --> 27:05.390
You got this. I'm going after Ivy.

27:42.833 --> 27:44.733
I'm getting you out of here.

27:44.758 --> 27:47.650
- Come on, let's go.
- Listen, listen.

27:47.675 --> 27:49.608
People need your help.

27:50.255 --> 27:52.607
This is who you are.

28:10.633 --> 28:12.313
Watch the doors.
I'm gonna go look for him.

28:12.420 --> 28:15.121
Where'd you go, punk? You
can run, but you can't hide.

28:25.399 --> 28:27.232
Hey! Hey!

28:27.552 --> 28:29.353
- Drop it!
- No!

28:39.913 --> 28:41.879
Hey. Hey!

29:32.607 --> 29:34.373
You hear the news?

29:34.711 --> 29:38.947
Crazy Ivy Pepper attacks
the Wayne Foundation dinner.

29:40.701 --> 29:44.091
I'll be honest, the evening didn't
turn out quite the way I'd hoped.

29:44.116 --> 29:47.138
You mean you didn't
get to kill everyone in there?

29:48.195 --> 29:49.615
Something like that.

29:49.917 --> 29:51.517
You got out.

29:51.809 --> 29:53.709
Made it back here.

29:57.094 --> 29:59.135
You always were the survivor.

30:00.628 --> 30:02.448
Well, you taught me that, Selina.

30:05.156 --> 30:07.119
What's in the bag, Ivy?

30:14.976 --> 30:16.854
It's the last of the Lazarus Water

30:16.879 --> 30:18.779
I stole from Wayne Enterprises.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.159
So you can go

30:21.184 --> 30:24.018
and make more plants to kill people?

30:28.377 --> 30:30.346
Yeah, that ain't gonna happen.

30:33.320 --> 30:35.589
Are you gonna stop me, Selina?

30:36.774 --> 30:40.443
You gonna remind me of the old days,

30:40.695 --> 30:42.895
tell me I'm not this person?

30:42.920 --> 30:45.821
No, I think we're past words now.

30:54.998 --> 30:57.783
Well, Selina Kyle

30:58.442 --> 31:00.974
turns out to be the hero.

31:05.965 --> 31:07.755
I'm no hero.

31:14.835 --> 31:17.803
One scratch is all it takes, Selina.

31:17.838 --> 31:20.455
And there's no antidote this time.

31:21.103 --> 31:23.455
And there's no more
jumping across rooftops

31:23.480 --> 31:25.978
for little dead Selina.

31:26.003 --> 31:27.681
I'll keep that in mind.

31:33.254 --> 31:35.521
You're gonna have to fight me, Selina.

31:36.182 --> 31:38.626
You can't run forever.

31:40.221 --> 31:42.661
I wasn't running.

31:42.707 --> 31:44.767
I was getting this.

31:46.567 --> 31:49.736
This is what you're gonna use
to make all your little plants?

31:50.837 --> 31:53.883
So I guess it's safe to say
that I shouldn't drop it.

31:53.908 --> 31:55.392
Stop, Selina.

31:56.577 --> 31:59.478
- I will let you leave.
- Let me?

32:01.782 --> 32:04.439
You're not gonna turn me into some

32:04.464 --> 32:06.631
geranium type thing?

32:07.921 --> 32:10.922
That's so generous.

32:11.344 --> 32:13.111
No!

32:16.978 --> 32:19.145
How can you side with them?

32:20.345 --> 32:22.638
All the people who hurt us.

32:26.287 --> 32:28.021
You think they're innocent.

32:29.536 --> 32:31.287
They're guilty.

32:32.446 --> 32:35.451
Every person in this city.

32:35.762 --> 32:37.803
They spew out poison.

32:39.383 --> 32:41.455
How are you not choking on it?

32:42.690 --> 32:46.681
The only thing that I'm choking
on, Ivy, is your insanity.

32:56.681 --> 32:58.781
You shouldn't have done that.

33:00.650 --> 33:03.462
- Now you're gonna die.
- Ivy, look down.

33:12.478 --> 33:15.134
- Well.
- Yeah.

33:16.557 --> 33:18.408
So, what happens now?

33:19.341 --> 33:22.499
- We kill each other?
- That's an option.

33:22.524 --> 33:24.860
You always did think
you were better than me.

33:24.885 --> 33:27.173
That's not true. I was your friend.

33:27.580 --> 33:30.439
We were friends, Ivy.
You said so yourself.

33:33.425 --> 33:35.439
That was a long time ago.

33:36.248 --> 33:38.252
I'm a different person now.

33:42.568 --> 33:44.400
This isn't what I want.

34:02.255 --> 34:04.400
Don't get in my way again.

34:20.164 --> 34:22.728
Lift your hands up. Got any weapons?

34:23.885 --> 34:25.025
I'd almost think

34:25.050 --> 34:27.283
this wasn't going to be
a friendly conversation.

34:27.762 --> 34:29.235
Just being careful.

34:29.261 --> 34:30.360
- They're clean.
- Okay.

34:30.802 --> 34:32.228
Smart lady.

34:33.398 --> 34:37.434
So you said you wanted 30%
of everything in the Narrows.

34:38.360 --> 34:39.705
What if I told you

34:39.739 --> 34:41.525
I had something more valuable to offer?

34:42.117 --> 34:43.907
Such as?

34:44.645 --> 34:46.174
Jim Gordon.

34:49.027 --> 34:51.619
I know crimes he's
committed no one else does.

34:51.871 --> 34:54.672
It would give you control over him.

34:54.965 --> 34:57.588
Surely that's worth
more than 30% of this.

34:57.613 --> 34:59.513
I have my own dirt on Jim Gordon.

34:59.631 --> 35:00.897
But you can't use it.

35:02.142 --> 35:04.814
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
sitting there threatening me.

35:05.125 --> 35:06.369
Would you?

35:09.804 --> 35:11.103
Sofia,

35:12.596 --> 35:13.994
take my deal.

35:20.399 --> 35:22.707
I have a better way
to bring Gordon around.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.639
No! No!

35:29.623 --> 35:32.591
Stay with me. Stay with me.

35:34.601 --> 35:37.333
You're never gonna
get out of here alive.

35:37.358 --> 35:39.992
- My people are gonna kill you!
- Your people?

35:40.017 --> 35:42.351
Who do you think planted these guns?

35:42.835 --> 35:44.777
You can come out.

35:48.809 --> 35:50.590
How you doing, Doc?

35:52.606 --> 35:55.012
I'm having Sampson run the Narrows.

35:55.037 --> 35:57.283
You know, you should've killed
me when you had the chance.

35:57.307 --> 35:58.864
Mm, the fact that you didn't

35:58.889 --> 36:01.390
told me everything I needed to know.

36:02.473 --> 36:03.689
No!

36:05.659 --> 36:08.848
Since we're family, I'm
only going to do one hand.

36:24.513 --> 36:26.567
Throw her on the streets.

36:28.159 --> 36:30.395
Let the Narrows see their queen.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.051
The scene here remains
largely out of control

36:42.075 --> 36:43.975
but Ivy Pepper remains at large.

36:44.077 --> 36:47.078
Now, inside, we have a
team of investigators...

36:56.612 --> 36:58.345
Yeah.

36:59.969 --> 37:01.481
What?

37:02.481 --> 37:03.871
Where is she?

37:14.205 --> 37:15.473
Sir?

37:16.114 --> 37:18.754
Sir? Excuse me.

37:19.295 --> 37:20.996
Are you family?

37:22.160 --> 37:23.613
I'm a cop.

37:25.820 --> 37:27.551
She wouldn't tell us who do it.

37:34.384 --> 37:36.187
She didn't have to.

37:44.662 --> 37:48.359
Arkham doesn't get many volunteers.

37:48.926 --> 37:50.960
You do know who I am, right?

37:51.964 --> 37:54.202
Criminally-insane
pretty much covers it.

37:54.450 --> 37:55.960
Read...

37:55.985 --> 37:57.398
and sign.

37:57.576 --> 37:59.309
I'll be back.

38:06.586 --> 38:08.419
Hate that you were right about this,

38:08.865 --> 38:10.798
but it'll keep her safe.

38:10.823 --> 38:12.456
Hey, Ed?

38:12.481 --> 38:15.491
- What has two eyes but can't see?
- Oh, this again.

38:15.608 --> 38:17.147
Two needles.

38:17.958 --> 38:20.006
Half of "Mississippi." Who cares?

38:22.057 --> 38:23.991
You should, Ed.

38:30.922 --> 38:33.056
I knew you'd come!

38:34.350 --> 38:37.809
- I knew you'd understand my letter!
- How did you know I'd be...?

38:38.256 --> 38:39.928
What are you talking about?

38:39.953 --> 38:45.905
- I'm not talking to you, Ed.
- I'm talking to him.

38:48.307 --> 38:50.407
He read my letter!

38:52.751 --> 38:54.998
Read the first word of each sentence.

38:56.458 --> 39:02.162
"Please bring Ed to Arkham
so I can set you free."

39:02.250 --> 39:04.155
What has two eyes but can't see

39:04.195 --> 39:05.530
what's happening in front of him?

39:05.555 --> 39:07.764
Ed Nygma!

39:07.789 --> 39:10.592
No. I came here to save Lee.

39:10.617 --> 39:12.264
He read my letter!

39:12.334 --> 39:13.334
You...

39:13.928 --> 39:15.569
You're wrong!

39:15.594 --> 39:17.327
I am Ed!

39:17.352 --> 39:19.486
Edward Nygma! That is it!

39:19.511 --> 39:22.061
Lee believes in me. She
sees me for who I am.

39:22.086 --> 39:26.235
- But I see him, Ed!
- No.

39:28.127 --> 39:31.061
Lee Thompkins may have made Ed strong,

39:31.445 --> 39:34.413
but I see the other you.

39:36.728 --> 39:39.763
The one whose name I wouldn't speak.

39:41.124 --> 39:43.389
But because he has earned it,

39:43.414 --> 39:47.194
and because I need
him, I'm saying it now.

39:47.234 --> 39:49.155
No, please! Please don't.

39:49.180 --> 39:51.914
- I need you...
- Please.

39:53.475 --> 39:55.030
Riddler.

40:17.812 --> 40:19.373
Shall we get to work?

40:30.159 --> 40:31.897
So...

40:32.841 --> 40:34.881
how'd you make it off the roof, then?

40:36.515 --> 40:38.678
A fire escape on the next building.

40:39.409 --> 40:41.575
Why'd you run from Gordon?

40:42.084 --> 40:43.897
I mean, you could've
told him it was you.

40:46.406 --> 40:47.819
I don't know.

40:51.302 --> 40:55.022
I just... couldn't.

40:58.302 --> 41:00.368
I'm going to help people, Alfred.

41:01.717 --> 41:04.108
And if that means accepting
every part of myself,

41:04.420 --> 41:06.220
good and bad,

41:07.542 --> 41:09.210
then I will.

41:13.234 --> 41:14.433
I do.

41:16.147 --> 41:17.917
That's what my parents
would have wanted.

41:18.762 --> 41:21.597
Your parents would be very proud of you.

41:25.130 --> 41:27.011
I'm proud of you.

41:32.191 --> 41:33.494
Alfred?

41:35.023 --> 41:39.125
If you... need a ride back
to Gotham, I can drive you.

41:40.189 --> 41:42.189
Oh, I'm not going anywhere, sir.

41:44.056 --> 41:45.861
I'm home.

42:01.694 --> 42:03.860
Congratulations.

42:04.284 --> 42:06.183
I heard you saved the day.

42:06.411 --> 42:07.994
Good job.

42:09.832 --> 42:11.439
There's a reason you're captain,

42:11.464 --> 42:15.366
and I'm a 50-year-old screw-up
pouring shots for barflies.

42:17.949 --> 42:19.635
There's a reason, all right.

42:19.660 --> 42:21.267
It's not what you think.

42:24.081 --> 42:25.588
I screwed up, Harv.

42:26.853 --> 42:28.541
I screwed up bad.

42:29.040 --> 42:31.049
And I'm gonna need your
help to make it right.

42:33.099 --> 42:34.939
Sofia hired the Pyg.

42:36.797 --> 42:38.150
And I knew.

42:40.142 --> 42:41.627
I knew,

42:43.219 --> 42:44.947
and I covered it up.

42:55.733 --> 42:57.826
And now I'm gonna take her down.
