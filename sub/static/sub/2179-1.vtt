WEBVTT

02:23.483 --> 02:25.942
Doc! Doc! Doc!

02:26.024 --> 02:27.775
Doc! Doc!
What?

02:29.524 --> 02:31.859
Okay, relax, Doc. It's
me. It's me! It's Marty.

02:31.939 --> 02:34.399
No, it can't be. I just
sent you back to the future.

02:34.483 --> 02:35.900
Yeah. No, I know.
You did send me

02:35.982 --> 02:37.775
back to the future,
but I'm back.

02:37.856 --> 02:40.024
I'm back
from the future.

02:43.231 --> 02:44.857
Great Scott!

05:00.888 --> 05:02.513
Hey, kids, what time is it?

05:02.594 --> 05:05.137
Howdy Doody time!

05:06.885 --> 05:08.677
Great Scott!

05:08.761 --> 05:12.221
It's Howdy Doody Time

05:12.303 --> 05:17.974
Bob Smith and Howdy Do
Say Howdy Do to you

05:18.053 --> 05:19.803
Howdy Doody time?

05:24.968 --> 05:29.555
Date. Sunday, November
13, 1955. 7:01 a. m.

05:29.634 --> 05:31.052
Last night's
time travel experiment

05:31.134 --> 05:33.052
was apparently
a complete success.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.718
Lightning struck the clock
tower at precisely 10:04 p. m.

05:35.799 --> 05:38.634
Sending the necessary 1.21
gigawatts into the time vehicle,

05:38.716 --> 05:40.925
which vanished in a
brilliant flash of light

05:41.007 --> 05:43.383
leaving a pair of
fire trails behind.

05:43.465 --> 05:45.549
I, therefore, assume that
Marty and the time vehicle

05:45.633 --> 05:49.428
were transported forward
through time into the year 1985.

05:49.507 --> 05:50.591
After that...

05:50.674 --> 05:53.634
After that, I can't
recall what happened.

05:53.715 --> 05:56.508
In fact, I don't even
remember how I got home.

05:56.590 --> 05:58.382
Perhaps
the gigawatt discharge

05:58.465 --> 06:00.174
coupled with the temporal
displacement field

06:00.255 --> 06:01.714
generated by
the time vehicle

06:01.797 --> 06:03.673
caused a disruption
of my own brain waves

06:03.757 --> 06:06.717
resulting in a condition
of momentary amnesia.

06:06.797 --> 06:08.089
Indeed, I now recall
that moments

06:08.173 --> 06:10.090
after the time vehicle
disappeared

06:10.172 --> 06:11.213
into the future,

06:11.297 --> 06:13.381
I saw a vision
of Marty saying

06:13.464 --> 06:15.381
he had come back
from the future.

06:15.463 --> 06:16.421
Hey, Doc!

06:16.504 --> 06:17.838
Undoubtedly, this was some
sort of residual image...

06:17.922 --> 06:18.964
Doc.

06:24.961 --> 06:28.213
Doc, calm down, okay. Just
calm down. It's me. It's Marty.

06:28.296 --> 06:30.839
No, it can't be you! I
sent you back to the future!

06:30.920 --> 06:32.046
That's right, Doc.
That's right,

06:32.127 --> 06:34.045
but I came back again. I
came back from the future.

06:34.128 --> 06:35.128
Don't you
remember last night?

06:35.211 --> 06:36.378
You fainted.
I brought you home.

06:36.462 --> 06:39.047
This can't be happening!
You can't be here!

06:39.129 --> 06:40.337
It doesn't make sense
for you to be here!

06:40.419 --> 06:42.545
I refuse to even believe
that you are here!

06:42.627 --> 06:44.545
Doc, I am here,
and it does make sense.

06:44.626 --> 06:47.170
Look, I came back to
1955 again with you,

06:47.253 --> 06:50.088
the you from 1985, 'cause we
had to get a book from Biff!

06:50.170 --> 06:51.253
So once I got
the book back,

06:51.334 --> 06:53.044
you, that is the you
from 1985,

06:53.126 --> 06:54.877
were in the DeLorean, and
it got struck by lightning,

06:54.960 --> 06:57.045
and you got
sent back to 1885!

06:57.126 --> 06:58.460
1885?

07:00.709 --> 07:03.669
It's a very interesting
story, future boy,

07:03.751 --> 07:06.461
but there's just one little
thing that doesn't make sense.

07:06.543 --> 07:08.919
If the me of the future
is now in the past,

07:09.003 --> 07:11.379
how could you
possibly know about it?

07:11.460 --> 07:12.877
You sent me a letter.

07:12.958 --> 07:15.126
"Dear Marty, if my
calculations are correct,

07:15.208 --> 07:16.709
"you will receive this
letter immediately after

07:16.792 --> 07:19.461
"you saw the DeLorean
struck by lightning.

07:19.541 --> 07:22.376
"First, let me assure you
that I'm alive and well.

07:22.459 --> 07:26.503
"I've been living happily these
past eight months in the year 1885.

07:26.583 --> 07:28.042
"The lightning bolt
that hit the DeLorean

07:28.124 --> 07:29.374
"caused a gigawatt
overload

07:29.457 --> 07:31.041
"which scrambled
the time circuits,

07:31.123 --> 07:32.707
"activated
the Flux Capacitor,

07:32.791 --> 07:35.710
"and sent me
back to 1885.

07:35.791 --> 07:37.542
"The overload shorted
out the time circuits

07:37.622 --> 07:39.582
"and destroyed
the flying circuits.

07:39.665 --> 07:42.333
"Unfortunately, the car
will never fly again. "

07:42.415 --> 07:43.707
It actually flew?

07:43.789 --> 07:45.457
Yeah, we had
a hover conversion done

07:45.538 --> 07:47.039
in the early
21st century.

07:47.122 --> 07:49.040
Incredible!

07:49.122 --> 07:52.207
"I set myself up as a
blacksmith as a front

07:52.289 --> 07:55.583
"while I attempted to repair
the damage to the time circuits.

07:55.663 --> 07:57.497
"Unfortunately,
this proved impossible,

07:57.579 --> 07:59.121
"because suitable
replacement parts

07:59.204 --> 08:02.457
"will not be
invented until 1947.

08:02.538 --> 08:04.080
"However,
I've gotten quite adept

08:04.162 --> 08:07.497
"at shoeing horses
and fixing wagons. "

08:08.621 --> 08:11.582
1885! Amazing!

08:11.662 --> 08:14.914
I actually end up as a
blacksmith in the Old West.

08:15.329 --> 08:16.705
Pretty heavy, huh?

08:16.787 --> 08:19.706
"I have buried the DeLorean
in the abandoned Delgado Mine

08:19.786 --> 08:22.121
"adjacent to the old
Boot Hill Cemetery

08:22.201 --> 08:24.369
"as shown on
the enclosed map.

08:24.452 --> 08:25.994
"Hopefully, it should
remain undisturbed

08:26.076 --> 08:29.537
"and preserved until
you uncover it in 1955.

08:30.786 --> 08:33.955
"Inside, you will find
repair instructions.

08:34.618 --> 08:38.078
"My 1955 counterpart... "
That's me.

08:38.159 --> 08:39.659
"... should have no
problem repairing it

08:39.743 --> 08:42.327
"so that you can drive it
back to the future.

08:42.408 --> 08:46.369
"Once you have returned to
1985, destroy the time machine. "

08:46.451 --> 08:47.951
Destroy it?

08:48.035 --> 08:51.120
Yeah. Well, it's
a long story, Doc.

08:51.199 --> 08:54.076
"Do not, I repeat,
do not attempt

08:54.159 --> 08:56.201
"to come back here
to get me.

08:56.783 --> 09:00.870
"I am perfectly happy living in
the fresh air and wide-open spaces.

09:00.950 --> 09:03.452
"And I fear that
unnecessary time travel

09:03.532 --> 09:05.199
"only risks
further disruption

09:05.283 --> 09:07.242
"of the space-time
continuum.

09:07.323 --> 09:10.784
"And please take care
of Einstein for me. "

09:12.323 --> 09:13.449
Einstein?

09:13.532 --> 09:17.952
He's your dog, Doc. Einstein is
what you call your dog in 1985.

09:20.947 --> 09:22.906
"I know you will
give him a good home.

09:22.989 --> 09:24.531
"Remember to
walk him twice a day

09:24.614 --> 09:26.991
"and that he only
likes canned dog food.

09:27.073 --> 09:30.284
"These are my wishes. Please
respect them and follow them.

09:30.364 --> 09:34.743
"And so, Marty, I now say
farewell and wish you Godspeed.

09:34.822 --> 09:37.365
"You've been a good, kind,
and loyal friend to me,

09:37.447 --> 09:40.157
"and you made a real
difference in my life.

09:40.238 --> 09:42.698
"I will always treasure
our relationship

09:42.778 --> 09:44.696
"and think on you
with fond memories,

09:44.778 --> 09:47.947
"warm feelings, and a
special place in my heart.

09:49.613 --> 09:53.450
"Your friend in time,
Doc Emmett L. Brown.

09:53.528 --> 09:56.155
"September 1st, 1885."

09:58.153 --> 10:00.029
I never knew I could
write anything so touching.

10:00.110 --> 10:01.861
I know. I know, Doc.
It's beautiful.

10:04.944 --> 10:06.820
It's all right,
Copernicus.

10:06.902 --> 10:08.111
Everything is
gonna be fine.

10:08.193 --> 10:11.070
I'm sorry, Doc. It's all my
fault you're stuck back there.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.736
I never should've
let Biff get to me.

10:12.818 --> 10:15.695
There are plenty worse places
to be than the Old West.

10:15.777 --> 10:17.361
I could have ended up
in the Dark Ages.

10:17.444 --> 10:18.652
They probably
would have burned me

10:18.736 --> 10:21.195
at the stake as
a heretic or something.

10:21.277 --> 10:22.861
Let's look at the map.

10:22.944 --> 10:24.611
All right, according to
this, the time vehicle

10:24.694 --> 10:27.696
is sealed off
in a side tunnel.

10:27.775 --> 10:29.276
We may have to blast.

10:42.442 --> 10:43.608
Whoa!

10:44.483 --> 10:46.651
I think you woke up
the dead with that blast.

10:46.733 --> 10:49.443
Take this camera. I want
to document everything!

10:51.816 --> 10:53.275
This reminds me
of the time

10:53.356 --> 10:55.691
I attempted to reach
the center of the Earth.

10:55.773 --> 10:58.316
I'd been reading my
favorite author, Jules Verne.

10:58.399 --> 11:00.191
I spent weeks preparing
that expedition.

11:00.273 --> 11:01.940
I didn't even
get this far.

11:02.023 --> 11:04.566
Of course, I was only 12 at the time.

11:04.647 --> 11:07.858
You know, it was the
writings of Jules Verne

11:07.938 --> 11:10.440
that had a profound
effect on my life.

11:10.523 --> 11:12.024
It was when I was 11
that I first read

11:12.106 --> 11:14.274
Twenty Thousand
Leagues Under the Sea.

11:14.356 --> 11:15.940
It was then
that I realized

11:16.022 --> 11:19.357
that I must devote
my life to science.

11:19.439 --> 11:21.898
Doc, check it out.
Look at this.

11:25.645 --> 11:27.187
My initials!

11:27.272 --> 11:29.606
Just like in Journey to
the Center of the Earth!

11:29.688 --> 11:30.730
That means
the time machine

11:30.771 --> 11:32.439
must be right
through this wall!

11:53.935 --> 11:59.189
It's been buried in here for 70
years, two months, and 13 days.

11:59.267 --> 12:00.600
Astounding!

12:00.685 --> 12:02.686
"As you see,
the lightning bolt

12:02.768 --> 12:05.812
"shorted out the time
circuit control microchip.

12:07.975 --> 12:10.059
"The attached... "

12:10.141 --> 12:11.182
Schematic.

12:11.267 --> 12:15.353
"Schematic diagram will allow
you to build a replacement unit

12:15.434 --> 12:16.976
"with 1955 components,

12:17.057 --> 12:19.767
"thus restoring the time machine
to perfect working order. "

12:19.850 --> 12:22.226
Unbelievable that this
little piece of junk

12:22.308 --> 12:24.309
could be
such a big problem.

12:26.849 --> 12:28.391
No wonder this
circuit failed.

12:28.474 --> 12:29.808
It says,
"Made in Japan. "

12:31.599 --> 12:35.102
What do you mean, Doc? All the
best stuff is made in Japan.

12:37.182 --> 12:38.558
Unbelievable!

12:44.597 --> 12:47.016
You know,
when I was a kid,

12:47.096 --> 12:49.222
I always wanted
to be a cowboy.

12:50.264 --> 12:52.807
And now, knowing I'm gonna
spend my future in the past,

12:52.888 --> 12:56.725
it sounds like a wonderful way
to spend my retirement years.

12:56.804 --> 12:59.681
It just occurred to me,
Marty, since I end up in 1885,

12:59.763 --> 13:01.848
perhaps I'm now in
the history books.

13:01.930 --> 13:03.806
I wonder.

13:03.887 --> 13:05.638
Could I go to the
library and look myself up

13:05.722 --> 13:07.973
in the old
newspaper archives?

13:08.054 --> 13:09.179
I don't know, Doc.

13:09.263 --> 13:10.430
You're the one that's
always saying, you know,

13:10.511 --> 13:12.512
it's not good to know too
much about your own destiny.

13:12.594 --> 13:16.097
You're right, Marty.
I know too much already.

13:16.177 --> 13:17.511
Better that I not
attempt to uncover

13:17.593 --> 13:21.346
the circumstances
of my own future.

13:21.428 --> 13:24.388
Copernicus.
Come on, boy!

13:24.928 --> 13:27.221
I'll get him, Doc.
Copernicus!

13:28.427 --> 13:31.262
Copernicus, come on.
Let's go home, boy.

13:32.177 --> 13:34.178
What's wrong?

13:34.261 --> 13:37.555
What's wrong,
Copernicus? Come on.

13:37.636 --> 13:40.304
Come on, let's go home.
Come on. Come on.

13:44.010 --> 13:47.095
Doc! Doc!
Come here!

13:47.175 --> 13:48.426
Quick!

13:50.258 --> 13:53.760
What's wrong, Marty? You
look like you've seen a ghost.

13:53.843 --> 13:55.969
You're not
far off, Doc.

14:00.216 --> 14:02.175
Great Scott!

14:02.258 --> 14:03.383
Check this out.

14:03.466 --> 14:06.635
"Died September 7th,
1885."

14:06.716 --> 14:08.425
That's one week after
you wrote the letter!

14:08.797 --> 14:12.133
"Erected in eternal memory
by his beloved Clara. "

14:12.507 --> 14:14.008
Who the hell
is Clara?

14:14.089 --> 14:15.881
Marty, please
don't stand there!

14:15.964 --> 14:17.506
Oh! Right. Sorry.

14:17.588 --> 14:19.548
I gotta get
another picture.

14:20.923 --> 14:25.010
"Shot in the back by Buford
Tannen over a matter of $80"?

14:25.589 --> 14:27.799
What kind of a future
do you call that?

14:28.881 --> 14:31.341
"Buford Tannen
was a notorious gunman

14:31.423 --> 14:34.174
"whose short temper
and a tendency to drool

14:34.255 --> 14:36.172
"earned him
the nickname Mad Dog.

14:36.256 --> 14:37.506
"He was quick
on the trigger

14:37.588 --> 14:39.798
"and bragged that
he had killed 12 men

14:39.880 --> 14:41.673
"not including
Indians or Chinamen. "

14:41.754 --> 14:43.463
Does it mention me?
Am I one of the 12?

14:43.546 --> 14:44.587
Just a minute.

14:44.672 --> 14:46.464
"However this claim
cannot be substantiated,

14:46.545 --> 14:48.254
"since precise records
were not kept

14:48.337 --> 14:50.005
"after Tannen shot
a newspaper editor

14:50.087 --> 14:52.922
"who printed an unfavorable
story about him in 1884."

14:53.003 --> 14:54.003
That's why
we can't find anything.

14:54.087 --> 14:55.087
Look.

14:56.669 --> 14:59.546
William McFly and family.
Your relatives?

14:59.627 --> 15:02.170
My great-grandfather's
name was William.

15:02.254 --> 15:04.755
That's him.
Good-looking guy.

15:06.835 --> 15:09.169
McFlys, but no Browns.

15:09.252 --> 15:10.252
Well, maybe it was
a mistake, Doc.

15:10.334 --> 15:11.418
Maybe that grave
wasn't yours.

15:11.502 --> 15:13.795
There could've been another
Emmett Brown back in 1885.

15:13.875 --> 15:14.875
No.
I don't know.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.043
Did you have any
relatives here back then?

15:16.127 --> 15:18.169
The Browns didn't come
to Hill Valley until 1908.

15:18.253 --> 15:19.837
And then they
were the von Brauns.

15:19.918 --> 15:22.461
My father changed our name
during the First World War.

15:22.543 --> 15:23.668
Doc, look.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.961
Great Scott, it's me!

15:29.041 --> 15:31.960
Then it is true,
all of it.

15:32.041 --> 15:35.460
It is me who goes back
there and gets shot.

15:35.543 --> 15:37.961
It's not gonna
happen, Doc.

15:38.041 --> 15:39.625
After you fix
the time circuits

15:39.708 --> 15:41.208
and put new tires
on the DeLorean,

15:41.292 --> 15:44.753
I'm going back to 1885,
and I'm bringing you home.

15:56.290 --> 15:58.166
The clothes fit?

15:58.247 --> 16:01.749
Yeah, everything except the
boots, Doc. They're kind of tight.

16:01.830 --> 16:04.164
I don't know. Are you sure
this stuff is authentic?

16:04.248 --> 16:07.583
Of course. Haven't
you ever seen a Western?

16:08.415 --> 16:10.541
Yeah, I have, Doc.

16:10.622 --> 16:13.499
Clint Eastwood never wore
anything like this.

16:14.746 --> 16:16.372
Clint who?

16:16.455 --> 16:18.456
That's right. You
haven't heard of him yet.

16:18.537 --> 16:20.371
Marty, you have
to wear the boots.

16:20.455 --> 16:23.165
You can't wear those
futuristic things back in 1885.

16:23.247 --> 16:25.081
You shouldn't even be
wearing them here in 1955.

16:25.162 --> 16:26.371
All right, Doc. Look,
as soon as I get there,

16:26.452 --> 16:27.661
I'll put them on.
I promise.

16:27.745 --> 16:29.329
Okay. I think
we're about ready.

16:29.412 --> 16:30.745
I put gas in the tank.

16:30.827 --> 16:32.327
Your future clothes
are packed.

16:32.411 --> 16:36.122
Just in case, fresh batteries
for your walkie-talkies.

16:36.579 --> 16:39.081
Oh! What about that
floating device?

16:39.162 --> 16:41.122
Hoverboard.
All right.

16:43.245 --> 16:44.870
You know, Doc, it's gonna
be a hell of a long walk

16:44.953 --> 16:46.662
back to Hill Valley
from here.

16:46.744 --> 16:48.036
It's still
the safest plan.

16:48.119 --> 16:50.829
After all, we can't risk sending
you back into a populated area

16:50.910 --> 16:53.161
or to a spot that's
geographically unknown.

16:53.244 --> 16:54.828
You don't want to
crash into some tree

16:54.911 --> 16:56.620
that once existed
in the past.

16:56.703 --> 16:59.162
This was all
completely open country,

16:59.243 --> 17:01.869
so you'll have plenty of run
out space when you arrive.

17:01.951 --> 17:05.078
Remember, where you're
going, there are no roads.

17:05.159 --> 17:06.326
There's a small cave
over there

17:06.410 --> 17:08.786
which will be a perfect place
to hide the time vehicle.

17:08.867 --> 17:12.621
Well, the new time circuit
control tubes are warmed up.

17:15.574 --> 17:17.367
Time circuits on.

17:17.449 --> 17:18.616
I wrote the letter
on September 1st,

17:18.699 --> 17:20.324
so we'll send you back
the very next day,

17:20.407 --> 17:21.407
September 2nd.
That's a Wednesday.

17:21.491 --> 17:24.159
September 2nd,
1885, 8:00 a. m.

17:24.239 --> 17:25.489
I get shot
on Monday the 7th,

17:25.574 --> 17:26.907
so you have five days
to locate me.

17:26.991 --> 17:28.241
According to my letter,
I'm a blacksmith,

17:28.324 --> 17:30.325
so I probably have
a shop somewhere.

17:30.990 --> 17:32.991
All you have to do is
drive the time vehicle

17:33.073 --> 17:34.407
directly toward
that screen,

17:34.490 --> 17:36.616
accelerating to
88 miles an hour.

17:36.698 --> 17:39.700
Wait a minute. Doc, if I drive
straight towards the screen,

17:39.781 --> 17:41.323
I'm gonna crash
into those Indians.

17:41.408 --> 17:44.743
Marty, you're not thinking
fourth-dimensionally.

17:44.824 --> 17:46.992
You'll instantly be
transported to 1885,

17:47.074 --> 17:49.200
and those Indians
won't even be there.

17:50.405 --> 17:52.280
Right.
Well.

17:53.989 --> 17:56.657
Good luck for
both of our sakes.

17:56.737 --> 17:57.988
See you in the future.

17:59.155 --> 18:00.155
You mean the past.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.240
Exactly.

18:08.071 --> 18:10.072
Happy trails, Marty!

18:15.653 --> 18:17.070
Ready, Marty?

18:18.070 --> 18:19.237
Ready!

18:19.903 --> 18:21.112
Set!

18:21.194 --> 18:22.403
Hi-ho, Silver.

18:59.734 --> 19:01.443
Indians!

19:40.312 --> 19:41.521
The cave!

20:16.643 --> 20:17.935
Charge!

20:22.101 --> 20:23.142
Shit! The cavalry!

21:14.306 --> 21:16.557
Damn, I ripped
the fuel line.

22:01.345 --> 22:05.431
Maggie! Fetch some water!
We got a hurt man here.

22:13.467 --> 22:16.052
Mom! Mom, is that you?

22:16.132 --> 22:17.299
There, there now.

22:17.382 --> 22:20.717
You've been asleep for
nearly six hours now.

22:20.801 --> 22:23.094
I had this
horrible nightmare.

22:24.799 --> 22:28.134
I dreamed... I dreamed
I was in a Western.

22:29.799 --> 22:36.179
I was being chased by all
these Indians and a bear.

22:36.256 --> 22:37.715
Well, you're safe
and sound

22:37.799 --> 22:39.549
here now
at the McFly farm.

22:40.465 --> 22:42.132
McFly farm?

22:45.339 --> 22:48.841
Well, you're my...
You're my, my...

22:50.588 --> 22:51.713
Who are you?

22:51.797 --> 22:54.423
The name is McFly.
Maggie McFly.

22:54.506 --> 22:58.050
McFly. Maggie?

22:58.422 --> 23:01.591
And that's Mrs. McFly, and
don't you be forgetting the Mrs.

23:01.672 --> 23:02.964
And what might
your name be, sir?

23:03.046 --> 23:04.880
Well, it's...

23:08.421 --> 23:09.755
Eastwood.

23:11.546 --> 23:13.714
Clint Eastwood.

23:14.170 --> 23:15.963
Well, you hit your head,
Mr. Eastwood.

23:16.044 --> 23:17.670
Not too serious,
but lucky for you,

23:17.753 --> 23:19.796
Seamus found you
when he did.

23:19.878 --> 23:21.629
Seamus.

23:21.710 --> 23:23.169
Me husband.

23:24.878 --> 23:29.048
You'll be excusing me, Mr.
Eastwood, while I tend to William.

23:29.126 --> 23:30.126
William.

23:30.378 --> 23:33.004
Oh, that's okay, Will.
It's okay.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.086
That's William?
Aye.

23:42.167 --> 23:45.753
William Sean McFly, the first of
our family to be born in America.

23:46.708 --> 23:48.084
It's okay, Will.

23:48.166 --> 23:51.752
This here is Mr. Clint
Eastwood here visiting.

23:51.834 --> 23:53.877
He surely likes you,
Mr. Eastwood.

23:54.874 --> 23:56.166
Maggie.

23:58.460 --> 23:59.627
I've got supper.

23:59.709 --> 24:02.336
I'm not one to pry into
a man's personal affairs,

24:02.415 --> 24:06.835
but exactly how is it that
you came to be way out here

24:06.916 --> 24:11.252
without a horse,
or boots, or a hat?

24:11.332 --> 24:13.541
Well, my car...

24:13.624 --> 24:16.751
Horse broke down,
and a bear ate my boots,

24:16.831 --> 24:18.707
and I guess
I just forgot my hat.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.584
How could you forget
a thing like your hat?

24:21.665 --> 24:22.873
Would you like
some water?

24:22.957 --> 24:24.123
Yeah.

24:34.954 --> 24:37.288
I'll tell you what
I'll do, Mr. Eastwood.

24:37.372 --> 24:39.706
I'll help you find
your blacksmith friend.

24:41.037 --> 24:44.122
You can stay
the night in the barn,

24:44.206 --> 24:47.375
and tomorrow I'll take you
as far as the railroad tracks.

24:47.454 --> 24:49.747
You can follow them
straight on into town.

24:52.745 --> 24:54.412
I'll even
give you a hat.

24:57.745 --> 24:59.120
That's great. Thanks.

25:02.536 --> 25:04.079
Ah...

25:04.162 --> 25:05.204
That's my William.

25:09.577 --> 25:10.869
Oh.

25:12.203 --> 25:13.328
Yes.

25:14.286 --> 25:16.871
I think you'll find
the barn comfortable.

25:16.953 --> 25:19.871
Never had any complaints
about it from the pigs.

25:19.952 --> 25:21.953
Mmm.
Seamus!

25:22.035 --> 25:23.118
A word with you.

25:23.202 --> 25:24.202
Aye.

25:27.909 --> 25:30.285
Will you hold him
for a minute?

25:34.034 --> 25:36.285
Are you sure you're not after
bringing a curse on this house

25:36.368 --> 25:38.577
taking him in
like that?

25:38.659 --> 25:40.076
He's such
a strange young man.

25:40.158 --> 25:43.118
Aye. But I've just got a
feeling about him, Maggie,

25:43.200 --> 25:45.910
that looking after him
is the right thing to do.

25:45.990 --> 25:47.407
That it's important.

25:47.490 --> 25:49.157
Hey, buddy.

25:49.241 --> 25:51.368
Look how the baby
takes to him.

25:51.449 --> 25:55.118
Little Will never
takes to strangers.

25:55.198 --> 25:58.116
It's almost as if
he's connected to us.

25:58.197 --> 25:59.197
Hey, Will.

25:59.822 --> 26:02.491
So you're my
great-grandfather.

26:02.572 --> 26:04.949
The first McFly
born in America.

26:10.698 --> 26:12.491
And you peed on me.

27:03.359 --> 27:04.567
Give us some soap.

27:04.651 --> 27:05.817
Here you go.

28:52.851 --> 28:55.478
Take a look and see what
just breezed in the door.

28:58.391 --> 29:00.893
Why, I didn't know
the circus was in town.

29:00.974 --> 29:04.518
Must have got that
shirt off a dead Chinese.

29:24.599 --> 29:26.183
What will it be,
stranger?

29:28.764 --> 29:32.391
I'll have ice water.

29:32.472 --> 29:34.139
Ice water?

29:35.181 --> 29:36.181
Water?

29:36.262 --> 29:38.347
You want water, you
better go dunk your head

29:38.430 --> 29:41.015
in the horse trough
out there.

29:41.096 --> 29:44.182
In here,
we pour whiskey.

29:54.970 --> 29:56.220
Excuse me.

29:56.304 --> 29:57.512
For what?

29:57.596 --> 30:00.014
I'm trying to
find the blacksmith.

30:01.053 --> 30:02.511
Hey, McFly!

30:04.510 --> 30:07.262
Thought I done told
you never to come in...

30:09.009 --> 30:10.801
You ain't
Seamus McFly.

30:12.510 --> 30:14.178
You look like him,
though,

30:14.261 --> 30:15.845
especially with
that dog-ugly hat.

30:19.177 --> 30:21.511
You kin to
that hay barber?

30:21.593 --> 30:23.385
What's your name,
dude?

30:23.469 --> 30:24.761
Marty...

30:25.883 --> 30:27.175
Eastwood.

30:28.635 --> 30:30.135
Clint Eastwood.

30:32.009 --> 30:34.344
What kind of
stupid name is that?

30:34.425 --> 30:36.509
I'd say he's the runt of the litter.

30:36.592 --> 30:39.218
Hey, now, boys, would you take a
look-see at these pearly whites?

30:39.300 --> 30:40.592
Hell, I ain't seen
teeth look that straight

30:40.674 --> 30:41.716
that weren't
store-bought.

30:41.799 --> 30:43.759
Take a gander at
them moccasins.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.343
What kind of skins
is them?

30:45.424 --> 30:46.507
What's that
writing mean?

30:46.592 --> 30:47.926
"Nike"?
What is that?

30:48.008 --> 30:49.634
Some sort of Injun
talk or something?

30:52.840 --> 30:56.468
Bartender, I'm looking for that
no-good, cheating blacksmith.

30:56.548 --> 30:57.882
You seen him?

30:57.963 --> 30:59.756
No, sir, Mr. Tannen.
I have not.

31:01.299 --> 31:02.591
Tannen.

31:03.507 --> 31:04.841
You're "Mad Dog" Tannen.

31:11.213 --> 31:13.006
"Mad Dog"?

31:13.087 --> 31:14.421
I hate that name.

31:15.422 --> 31:18.049
I hate it, you hear?

31:18.129 --> 31:21.006
Nobody calls me
"Mad Dog"!

31:21.089 --> 31:25.009
Especially not some duded-up,
egg-sucking gutter trash.

31:27.171 --> 31:29.047
Dance!

31:29.129 --> 31:30.254
Come on!

31:32.463 --> 31:35.381
Come on, runt! You can
dance better than that!

31:45.627 --> 31:46.668
Shit.

31:47.920 --> 31:49.086
Whoo!

32:08.501 --> 32:10.085
You better run,
squirrel.

32:10.166 --> 32:11.541
Get him!

32:23.458 --> 32:24.625
Whoa!

33:15.161 --> 33:18.038
We got ourselves
a new courthouse.

33:18.120 --> 33:19.662
High time
we had a hanging!

33:39.701 --> 33:41.410
Look at him swing.

33:44.869 --> 33:48.163
Yeah, haven't had a
hanging in a long time!

33:51.368 --> 33:54.704
It'll shoot the fleas off a
dog's back at 500 yards, Tannen,

33:54.783 --> 33:56.784
and it's pointed
straight at your head!

34:07.282 --> 34:08.741
You owe me money,
blacksmith.

34:08.822 --> 34:10.239
How do you figure?

34:10.324 --> 34:11.949
My horse threw a shoe.

34:12.031 --> 34:13.572
And seeing as you was the
one that done the shoeing,

34:13.655 --> 34:15.031
I say that makes
you responsible.

34:15.116 --> 34:19.077
Well, since you never paid me for
the job, I say that makes us even.

34:19.157 --> 34:21.241
Wrong! See I was
on my horse

34:21.322 --> 34:23.032
when it threw the shoe,
and I got throwed off!

34:23.114 --> 34:25.239
And that caused me
to bust a perfectly

34:25.324 --> 34:27.742
good bottle of
fine Kentucky red eye.

34:27.822 --> 34:29.697
So the way
I figure it, blacksmith,

34:29.781 --> 34:31.657
you owe me $5
for the whiskey

34:31.739 --> 34:33.949
and $75 for the horse!

34:34.822 --> 34:35.907
That's the $80.

34:35.989 --> 34:38.449
Look, if your horse
threw a shoe,

34:38.529 --> 34:40.405
bring him back,
and I'll reshoe him.

34:40.487 --> 34:42.112
I done shot that horse!

34:42.196 --> 34:44.406
Well, that's your problem,
Tannen.

34:44.487 --> 34:47.532
Wrong. That's yours.

34:47.614 --> 34:51.283
So from now on, you better be
looking behind you when you walk.

34:51.364 --> 34:53.991
Because one day you're gonna
get a bullet in your back.

35:03.986 --> 35:04.944
Doc!

35:05.028 --> 35:10.157
Marty, I gave you explicit
instructions not to come here

35:10.236 --> 35:12.404
but to go
directly back to 1985.

35:12.484 --> 35:15.153
I know, Doc,
but I had to come.

35:15.986 --> 35:18.404
But it's good to
see you, Marty.

35:22.651 --> 35:24.611
Marty, you're gonna have to do
something about those clothes.

35:24.693 --> 35:26.068
You walk around town
dressed like that,

35:26.151 --> 35:27.693
you're liable
to get shot.

35:27.774 --> 35:28.733
Or hanged.

35:28.817 --> 35:31.944
What idiot dressed you
in that outfit?

35:32.024 --> 35:33.316
You did.

35:36.152 --> 35:38.403
"Shot in the back
by Buford Tannen

35:38.775 --> 35:40.735
"over a matter of $80,

35:40.901 --> 35:43.068
"September 7"?

35:43.150 --> 35:45.151
That's this Monday!

35:45.232 --> 35:47.734
Now I wish
I'd paid him off.

35:47.817 --> 35:49.568
And who's this
beloved Clara?

35:49.649 --> 35:51.942
I don't know
anyone named Clara.

35:52.024 --> 35:54.817
I don't know, Doc.

35:54.900 --> 35:57.067
I thought maybe she was
a girlfriend of yours.

35:57.149 --> 36:02.403
Marty, my involvement in such a
social relationship here in 1885

36:02.480 --> 36:06.400
could result in a disruption
of the space-time continuum.

36:06.480 --> 36:10.525
As a scientist, I can
never take that risk.

36:12.148 --> 36:14.691
Certainly not after what
we've already been through.

36:14.771 --> 36:15.897
Emmett!

36:15.980 --> 36:17.147
Hello, Emmett.

36:17.229 --> 36:18.354
Hubert.

36:18.897 --> 36:20.105
It's the mayor.

36:20.187 --> 36:22.397
Excuse me, Emmett.

36:22.478 --> 36:25.147
Do you remember last week at the
town meeting when you volunteered

36:25.229 --> 36:26.563
to meet the new
schoolteacher

36:26.645 --> 36:27.687
at the station
when she came in?

36:27.770 --> 36:28.729
Oh, yes, quite so.

36:28.812 --> 36:31.272
Well, we just got word
she's coming in tomorrow.

36:31.354 --> 36:33.314
Here are the details
for you.

36:33.396 --> 36:34.855
Thanks for
all your help.

36:34.937 --> 36:36.855
Anytime, Hubert.

36:36.937 --> 36:40.982
Oh! Her name's Miss
Clayton. Clara Clayton.

36:49.476 --> 36:53.646
Well, Doc, now we know who Clara is.

36:55.392 --> 36:57.602
Marty, it's impossible.

36:57.686 --> 37:00.980
The idea that I could fall in love
at first sight is romantic nonsense.

37:02.144 --> 37:04.395
There's no scientific
rationale for that concept.

37:04.476 --> 37:06.477
Aw, come on, Doc.
It's not science.

37:06.560 --> 37:09.061
You meet the right girl, it just
hits you. It's like lightning.

37:09.142 --> 37:10.726
Marty, please
don't say that.

37:10.809 --> 37:13.394
That's the way it was
for me and Jennifer.

37:13.475 --> 37:16.436
I mean, we couldn't keep
our eyes off each other.

37:16.516 --> 37:18.559
God, Jennifer, damn. I
hope she's all right, Doc.

37:18.641 --> 37:20.976
I can't believe we just
left her there on the porch.

37:21.057 --> 37:23.058
Don't worry, Marty.
She'll be fine.

37:23.140 --> 37:25.224
When you burned
the almanac in 1955,

37:25.308 --> 37:26.892
the normal timeline
was restored.

37:26.975 --> 37:28.726
That means once
we're back in 1985,

37:28.806 --> 37:30.807
you just have to go over
to her house to wake her up.

37:32.683 --> 37:34.976
Oh, Marty, turn that valve over there

37:35.057 --> 37:36.099
all the way
to the right.

37:36.180 --> 37:38.056
Yeah, pull it
all the way around.

37:38.139 --> 37:39.639
Okay. Let's go!

37:53.807 --> 37:55.349
Iced tea?

37:55.430 --> 37:56.805
No, thanks.

37:57.389 --> 37:59.265
It's a refrigerator.

37:59.347 --> 38:01.056
Well, I guess
Miss Clayton

38:01.137 --> 38:03.054
will have to find
other transportation.

38:03.139 --> 38:04.139
If I never
meet the woman,

38:04.221 --> 38:06.389
there's no possibility of a
romantic infatuation, right?

38:06.471 --> 38:08.347
You're the doc, Doc.
All right.

38:08.428 --> 38:10.971
We'll get the DeLorean and get
ourselves back to the future.

38:11.054 --> 38:12.388
Oh, listen, Doc,
I tore a hole

38:12.470 --> 38:13.637
in the gas tank
when I was landing,

38:13.720 --> 38:16.305
so we're gonna have to
patch it up and get some gas.

38:16.385 --> 38:18.678
You mean we're
out of gas?

38:18.762 --> 38:19.762
Yeah, it's no big deal.

38:19.847 --> 38:21.472
We've got
Mr. Fusion, right?

38:21.553 --> 38:25.389
Mr. Fusion powers the time
circuits and the Flux Capacitor,

38:25.469 --> 38:28.388
but the internal combustion
engine runs on ordinary gasoline.

38:28.469 --> 38:30.220
It always has.

38:30.302 --> 38:32.261
There's not gonna be
a gas station around here

38:32.343 --> 38:34.970
until sometime in
the next century.

38:35.052 --> 38:36.720
Without gasoline,

38:36.801 --> 38:39.970
we can't get the DeLorean
up to 88 miles per hour.

38:42.509 --> 38:43.926
So what do we do?

38:54.384 --> 38:55.968
Twenty-four!

38:56.051 --> 38:57.594
It's no use, Marty!

38:57.675 --> 38:59.885
Even the fastest
horse in the world

38:59.966 --> 39:02.634
won't run more than 35,
40 miles an hour!

39:13.299 --> 39:16.467
Bartender said that's the
strongest stuff they got.

39:16.549 --> 39:18.091
Try it, Marty.

39:29.340 --> 39:31.133
Give it more gas!

39:40.422 --> 39:41.630
Damn!

39:43.630 --> 39:46.215
It blew the fuel
injection manifold.

39:46.296 --> 39:48.213
Strong stuff,
all right.

39:48.296 --> 39:51.214
It will take me a month
to rebuild it.

39:51.296 --> 39:52.671
A month?

39:53.004 --> 39:54.796
Doc, you're gonna
get shot on Monday!

39:54.878 --> 39:58.422
I know! I know!
I know! I wish...

39:58.503 --> 40:03.215
Wait. I've got it! We can
simply roll it down a steep hill!

40:03.295 --> 40:05.212
Oh! We'd never find
a smooth enough surface.

40:05.294 --> 40:06.294
Unless...

40:06.377 --> 40:08.336
Of course! Ice!

40:08.421 --> 40:10.630
We'll wait until winter
when the lake freezes over.

40:10.710 --> 40:12.460
Winter? Doc, what are you talking about?

40:12.544 --> 40:14.003
Monday!
It's three days away!

40:14.086 --> 40:15.044
All right, all right,
all right.

40:15.128 --> 40:18.380
Just let's think this
thing through logically.

40:18.459 --> 40:20.210
We know it won't run
under its own power.

40:20.293 --> 40:22.168
We know
we can't pull it.

40:22.252 --> 40:25.713
But if we could
figure out a way

40:25.793 --> 40:28.962
to push it up to
88 miles an hour.

40:29.042 --> 40:30.418
Huh?

40:38.583 --> 40:39.666
That's it.

40:39.749 --> 40:43.627
How fast can she go? Why,
I've had her up to 55 myself.

40:44.789 --> 40:46.790
I heard that
Fearless Frank Fargo

40:46.874 --> 40:48.207
got one of these
up to near 70

40:48.292 --> 40:50.084
out past
Verde Junction.

40:50.166 --> 40:52.835
Do you think it's possible
to get it up to 90?

40:52.915 --> 40:54.165
Ninety?

40:54.249 --> 40:57.042
Tarnation, son, who'd ever
need to be in such a hurry?

40:57.123 --> 40:59.374
It's just a little bet
he and I have, that's all.

40:59.455 --> 41:01.957
Theoretically speaking,
could it be done?

41:02.041 --> 41:03.876
Well, I suppose,
if you had a straight

41:03.957 --> 41:05.791
stretch of track
with a level grade,

41:05.874 --> 41:08.333
and you weren't hauling
no cars behind you,

41:08.415 --> 41:10.207
and if you could get
the fire hot enough.

41:10.289 --> 41:14.250
And I'm talking about hotter than the
blazes of hell and damnation itself.

41:14.331 --> 41:16.541
Then yes, sir, it might be
possible to get her up that fast.

41:16.620 --> 41:18.705
Tell me, when does the next
train come through here?

41:18.788 --> 41:20.205
Monday morning at 8:00.

41:20.289 --> 41:22.874
Here. This spur that
runs off the main line

41:22.955 --> 41:24.455
three miles out
to Clayton Ravine.

41:24.537 --> 41:26.079
It's a long stretch
of level track

41:26.161 --> 41:28.496
that will still
exist in 1985.

41:28.581 --> 41:32.041
This is where we'll push the
DeLorean with the locomotive.

41:32.120 --> 41:35.664
Funny. This map calls
Clayton Ravine Shonash Ravine.

41:35.745 --> 41:38.873
That must be the old Indian
name for it. It's perfect.

41:38.954 --> 41:40.746
A nice long run
that goes clear across

41:40.828 --> 41:41.870
the bridge
over the ravine,

41:41.952 --> 41:44.287
you know, over near that
Hilldale housing development.

41:44.369 --> 41:48.956
Right, Doc, but according to
this map, there is no bridge.

41:49.325 --> 41:52.870
Well, Doc,
we can scratch that idea.

41:52.953 --> 41:54.287
I mean, we can't
wait a year and a half

41:54.369 --> 41:55.411
for this thing
to get finished.

41:55.495 --> 41:56.912
Marty, it's perfect.

41:56.995 --> 41:59.121
You're just not thinking
fourth-dimensionally.

41:59.203 --> 42:00.912
Right. Right. I have a
real problem with that.

42:00.994 --> 42:04.872
Don't you see? The
bridge will exist in 1985.

42:04.951 --> 42:06.827
It's safe
and still in use.

42:06.910 --> 42:09.704
Therefore, as long as we get the
DeLorean up to 88 miles an hour

42:09.785 --> 42:11.494
before we hit
the edge of the ravine,

42:11.576 --> 42:14.035
we'll instantaneously
arrive at a point in time

42:14.118 --> 42:16.244
where the bridge
is completed.

42:16.325 --> 42:21.872
We'll have track under us and
coast safely across the ravine.

42:21.948 --> 42:23.115
What about
the locomotive?

42:23.200 --> 42:25.201
It will be
a spectacular wreck.

42:25.285 --> 42:27.160
Too bad no one will
be around to see it.

42:28.990 --> 42:30.866
Help me! Help!

42:30.949 --> 42:32.324
Great Scott!

43:14.778 --> 43:15.862
Hurry!

43:17.988 --> 43:19.280
Jump!

43:29.570 --> 43:30.570
Whoa.

43:31.403 --> 43:32.570
Whoa.

43:32.944 --> 43:33.986
Oh...

43:34.067 --> 43:36.777
Thank you, sir.
You saved my...

43:39.027 --> 43:40.069
...life.

43:44.443 --> 43:46.862
Emmett Brown at
your service, Miss...

43:50.317 --> 43:51.651
Clayton.

43:53.275 --> 43:54.441
Clara Clayton.

43:55.774 --> 43:56.774
Clara!

44:00.609 --> 44:02.318
What a beautiful name.

44:19.773 --> 44:22.441
May I help you
inside with these?

44:22.524 --> 44:25.234
Oh, no, that won't be
necessary. I can take care of it.

44:25.314 --> 44:27.816
You've done more
than enough already.

44:27.897 --> 44:29.648
But it's really
no trouble.

44:29.731 --> 44:32.108
Doc, she says it's fine,
and we got to get going.

44:32.187 --> 44:35.940
Ma'am, good luck with your
school teaching and everything.

44:36.022 --> 44:39.024
Clara, I'll straighten
everything out

44:39.105 --> 44:40.897
with Mr. Statler for
the buckboard rental.

44:40.980 --> 44:42.313
Don't worry about that.

44:42.397 --> 44:44.439
I feel somewhat responsible
for what happened.

44:44.521 --> 44:45.521
Oh.

44:46.437 --> 44:50.190
That would be very gentlemanly
of you, Mr. Brown. Emmett.

44:53.062 --> 44:55.522
You know,
I'm almost glad

44:55.603 --> 44:56.979
that snake
spooked those horses.

44:57.062 --> 44:59.981
Otherwise,
we might never have met.

45:00.061 --> 45:01.562
I suppose
it was destiny.

45:05.102 --> 45:07.270
Well, thank you
for everything.

45:07.687 --> 45:09.563
You're quite welcome.

45:11.893 --> 45:14.520
I will see you again,
won't I?

45:14.603 --> 45:15.854
Of course.
You'll see lots of me.

45:15.936 --> 45:17.395
I'm sure.
I have a shop in town.

45:17.477 --> 45:20.354
I'm the local scientist,
blacksmith.

45:21.018 --> 45:23.770
Science?
What sort of science?

45:23.852 --> 45:25.602
Astronomy?
Chemistry?

45:26.060 --> 45:28.520
Actually, I'm a student
of all sciences.

45:28.600 --> 45:31.644
Hey, Doc,
we got to get going.

45:31.725 --> 45:34.686
Oh, yes.
Well, excuse us, Clara.

45:34.768 --> 45:36.602
We have to get going.

45:41.184 --> 45:42.268
Toodle-oo.

45:50.640 --> 45:52.599
What do you mean, you're gonna
be seeing lots of her, Doc?

45:52.681 --> 45:55.850
Well, I might see her
again just in passing.

45:55.931 --> 45:58.015
Come on, Doc. Did you see the
way she was looking at you?

46:00.016 --> 46:03.102
She did have
quite a scare, right?

46:03.180 --> 46:04.639
After all, Miss Clayton
almost ended up

46:04.722 --> 46:06.640
at the bottom of
Clayton Ravine.

46:06.724 --> 46:07.683
Clayton Ravine.

46:07.765 --> 46:12.894
Holy shit. Hey, Doc, Clayton
Ravine was named after a teacher.

46:12.974 --> 46:14.933
They say she fell in
there 100 years ago.

46:15.015 --> 46:17.851
100 years ago!
That's this year!

46:17.930 --> 46:19.180
Every kid in school
knows that story,

46:19.263 --> 46:20.221
'cause we all
have teachers

46:20.305 --> 46:22.306
we'd like to see
fall into the ravine.

46:22.388 --> 46:23.847
Great Scott!

46:25.220 --> 46:28.430
Then she was supposed
to go over in that wagon.

46:29.596 --> 46:32.473
Now I may have
seriously altered history.

46:33.595 --> 46:36.639
Look, Doc, what's the
worst that can happen, huh?

46:36.720 --> 46:39.097
So they don't name
the ravine after her.

46:39.179 --> 46:40.304
Let's just get
the DeLorean ready

46:40.387 --> 46:41.512
and get the hell
out of here.

46:41.593 --> 46:45.054
I wish I'd never invented
that infernal time machine.

46:46.387 --> 46:49.138
It's caused
nothing but disaster.

46:52.760 --> 46:54.010
Doc, Doc,
this is Marty.

46:54.095 --> 46:55.178
Do you read me? Over.

46:55.260 --> 46:56.301
Check, Marty.

46:56.386 --> 46:58.762
Great, Doc.
These things still work.

46:58.844 --> 47:00.261
All right, Marty.

47:00.343 --> 47:03.804
Once more, let's go over
the entire plan and layout.

47:03.885 --> 47:05.886
I apologize for the crudity
of this model, but I just...

47:05.968 --> 47:08.970
Yeah, I know, Doc. It's not
to scale. It's okay, Doc.

47:09.050 --> 47:12.511
All right.
Tomorrow night, Sunday,

47:12.593 --> 47:15.470
we'll load the DeLorean onto
the tracks here, on the spur

47:15.549 --> 47:17.842
right by the old
abandoned silver mine.

47:17.925 --> 47:20.760
The switch track is where the
spur runs off the main line

47:20.842 --> 47:24.344
three miles out to
Clayton... Shonash Ravine.

47:24.424 --> 47:27.218
The train leaves the station
at 8:00 Monday morning.

47:27.299 --> 47:29.843
We'll stop it here, uncouple
the cars from the tender,

47:29.924 --> 47:32.133
throw the switch track,
and then we'll hijack...

47:32.216 --> 47:36.177
Borrow the locomotive and use
it to push the time machine.

47:36.258 --> 47:37.466
According to
my calculations,

47:37.550 --> 47:38.925
we'll reach
88 miles per hour

47:39.006 --> 47:41.007
just before we hit
the edge of the ravine,

47:41.089 --> 47:44.758
at which point we'll be
instantaneously transported back to 1985

47:44.840 --> 47:47.258
and coast safely across
the completed bridge.

47:47.338 --> 47:50.090
What does this mean?
"Point of no return. "

47:50.173 --> 47:52.132
That's our
fail-safe point.

47:52.215 --> 47:53.590
Up until there, we have
still have enough time

47:53.673 --> 47:56.258
to stop the locomotive before
it plunges into the ravine.

47:56.338 --> 47:57.505
But once we
pass this windmill,

47:57.588 --> 47:58.755
it's the future
or bust.

48:01.755 --> 48:05.424
Here you go, Marty. Connect
that to the positive terminal.

48:06.420 --> 48:07.462
All right,
Marty, you all set?

48:07.546 --> 48:08.796
Yeah. Yeah. Go!

48:09.254 --> 48:11.922
Train pulling
out of the station!

48:12.003 --> 48:14.171
Coming up to
the switch track!

48:14.253 --> 48:16.838
Stop at
the switch track!

48:16.922 --> 48:19.173
Throw the switch!

48:19.253 --> 48:21.671
Pull up
to the DeLorean!

48:21.754 --> 48:25.924
Pushing the DeLorean
up to 88 miles per hour!

48:32.293 --> 48:34.253
It couldn't be simpler.

48:40.752 --> 48:42.753
Emmett?

48:42.837 --> 48:44.420
It's Clara.

48:44.502 --> 48:46.586
Quick,
cover the DeLorean!

48:53.876 --> 48:54.876
Hello.

48:54.959 --> 48:56.167
Why, hello.

48:56.251 --> 48:58.377
This is
quite a surprise.

48:59.915 --> 49:02.041
Well, I hope I'm not
disturbing anything.

49:02.124 --> 49:05.669
Oh, no, no, we were just doing
a little model railroading.

49:06.207 --> 49:07.290
Oh.

49:08.790 --> 49:11.834
Emmett, when my bags were
thrown from the wagon,

49:11.916 --> 49:13.792
my telescope
was damaged.

49:13.874 --> 49:17.418
And since you mentioned
an interest in science,

49:17.500 --> 49:20.836
I thought you might be
able to repair it for me.

49:20.915 --> 49:22.874
I would pay you,
of course.

49:22.957 --> 49:27.252
Oh, no, no, no. I wouldn't
think of charging you for this.

49:27.331 --> 49:29.499
Well, let's have
a look at it.

49:29.581 --> 49:31.833
I think a lens may
be out of alignment,

49:31.913 --> 49:35.457
because if you
move it this way,

49:35.539 --> 49:38.582
the image turns fuzzy.
See?

49:38.664 --> 49:43.751
But if you turn it
the other way then...

49:44.704 --> 49:46.497
Everything becomes...

49:49.412 --> 49:50.746
...clear.

49:55.912 --> 49:58.664
I could repair it right away
and have it for you tonight.

49:58.745 --> 50:01.497
Oh, tonight is
the town festival.

50:01.578 --> 50:04.163
I wouldn't dream of having
you work on my telescope

50:04.244 --> 50:05.994
during such
an important occasion.

50:06.078 --> 50:09.247
You are planning on
attending, aren't you?

50:10.494 --> 50:12.161
Well, actually,
ma'am, I don't think...

50:12.244 --> 50:14.829
Yes, of course,
the festival.

50:14.911 --> 50:16.829
Well, in that case,

50:16.910 --> 50:20.454
I'll see you this evening
at the festival, Emmett.

50:20.536 --> 50:22.495
Mr. Eastwood.
Ma'am.

50:25.576 --> 50:27.994
Thank you for taking
care of my telescope.

50:28.076 --> 50:29.952
You're quite welcome.

50:35.911 --> 50:37.328
It's a nice telescope.

50:37.408 --> 50:40.077
Ladies and gentlemen,

50:40.159 --> 50:44.538
as mayor of Hill Valley,
it gives me great pleasure

50:44.617 --> 50:47.744
to dedicate this clock to
the people of Hill County!

50:48.909 --> 50:52.662
May it stand
for all time!

50:52.740 --> 50:54.032
Tell me when, gentlemen.

50:55.241 --> 50:59.077
Three! Two! One!

50:59.907 --> 51:01.241
Now!

51:06.698 --> 51:09.158
Let the festivities
begin!

51:16.780 --> 51:17.905
You know, Marty,
in a way, it's fitting

51:17.986 --> 51:20.279
that you and I are
here to witness this.

51:20.363 --> 51:23.031
It's too bad I didn't
bring my camera.

51:29.738 --> 51:30.863
Ready, gentlemen?

51:32.239 --> 51:35.658
The only problem is we'll never
be able to show it to anybody.

51:35.736 --> 51:36.903
Smile, Doc.

51:39.321 --> 51:40.571
Yee-ha!

52:01.651 --> 52:03.985
What great music!

52:04.068 --> 52:06.778
Yeah, it's got a beat,
and you can dance to it.

52:06.859 --> 52:07.859
Step right up
gentlemen

52:07.941 --> 52:09.858
and test your mettle
with the latest products

52:09.943 --> 52:13.987
from Colonel Samuel Colt's Patent
Firearms Manufacturing Company

52:14.067 --> 52:15.692
of Hartford,
Connecticut.

52:15.775 --> 52:18.693
Now, take this model,
for example.

52:18.775 --> 52:22.444
The new, improved and
refined Colt Peacemaker

52:22.525 --> 52:27.737
selling to you tonight for
the low, low price of $12.

52:43.857 --> 52:45.817
Good evening.
Evening.

52:47.064 --> 52:49.482
You look very nice.

52:49.564 --> 52:51.023
Thank you.

52:59.897 --> 53:01.523
Would you like...

53:03.396 --> 53:04.605
Would you care to...

53:04.687 --> 53:05.896
I'd love to.

53:24.228 --> 53:26.187
Young man, how about you?
You want to give it a try?

53:26.268 --> 53:29.479
No, no. No, thanks.
Hey, Doc, this...

53:37.352 --> 53:38.560
Son!

53:39.392 --> 53:40.392
Sonny boy!

53:40.477 --> 53:41.936
The Doc can dance?

53:44.560 --> 53:48.438
Son. Son. Son!

53:48.519 --> 53:52.939
Hey, I just told you that even
a baby could handle this weapon.

53:53.017 --> 53:56.102
Surely you're not afraid to try
something that a baby could do.

53:56.184 --> 53:57.434
Hey, I'm not afraid
of nothing.

53:57.518 --> 54:00.478
Come on, then. Let's just
step up here like a man.

54:00.557 --> 54:04.977
Now, then what you do is you
just ease that hammer back there

54:05.058 --> 54:06.809
and squeeze off
a round.

54:06.891 --> 54:08.475
No, no, no!

54:08.558 --> 54:11.310
Right on out there
and be real smooth.

54:11.390 --> 54:13.475
That's the way
you do it.

54:16.932 --> 54:18.599
Listen,
can I try that again?

54:18.680 --> 54:20.097
Yeah, go ahead.

54:32.223 --> 54:34.015
Hey, just tell me
one thing.

54:34.096 --> 54:36.640
Where did you learn
to shoot like that?

54:36.724 --> 54:38.058
7- Eleven.

54:42.972 --> 54:44.264
Buford, you sure
that blacksmith

54:44.346 --> 54:46.138
is gonna be at
this here shindig?

54:46.222 --> 54:49.057
Sure he's here.
Everybody's here tonight.

54:51.637 --> 54:53.471
You gentlemen will have
to check your firearms

54:53.554 --> 54:55.806
if you want to join in
on the festivities.

54:57.137 --> 54:58.638
Who's gonna make us,
tenderfoot? You?

54:58.720 --> 55:00.221
I am.

55:03.261 --> 55:06.013
Marshal Strickland. I didn't
know you was back in town.

55:06.093 --> 55:07.719
If you can't
read the sign, Tannen,

55:07.803 --> 55:10.054
I presume
you can read this.

55:10.469 --> 55:11.803
Pretty tough hombre
when you're pointing

55:11.886 --> 55:13.220
a scatter gun
at a man's back.

55:13.303 --> 55:16.430
Just like you, Tannen, I take
every advantage I can get.

55:16.510 --> 55:19.178
Now you gonna
check your iron?

55:19.843 --> 55:22.303
I was just joking
with your deputy.

55:22.384 --> 55:24.093
Of course,
I'm gonna check my iron.

55:24.175 --> 55:25.550
We all were.
Weren't we, boys?

55:25.634 --> 55:26.967
Yeah, right.

55:28.593 --> 55:30.093
Tannen.

55:31.218 --> 55:33.052
Your knife, too.

55:39.926 --> 55:43.094
Smile, Marshal. After
all, this is a party.

55:43.175 --> 55:45.635
Only party
I'll be smiling at

55:45.717 --> 55:48.385
is the one that sees you
at the end of a rope.

55:51.299 --> 55:52.758
Have fun!

55:56.422 --> 55:57.756
See, that's how
you handle them, Son.

55:57.841 --> 55:58.883
Never give them
an inch

55:58.966 --> 56:01.301
and maintain discipline
at all times.

56:01.383 --> 56:04.302
Remember that word,
discipline.

56:04.381 --> 56:05.882
I will, Pa.

56:06.715 --> 56:09.133
Swing that partner
With a right big swing

56:09.214 --> 56:11.423
Over to the side
It's the same old thing

56:11.797 --> 56:12.838
Thank you very much.

56:12.922 --> 56:17.300
Why, Mr. Eastwood,
nice to see you.

56:17.380 --> 56:21.801
I see you got yourself some respectable
clothes, lad, and a fine hat.

56:21.879 --> 56:22.921
Yeah, well,
a couple people

56:23.004 --> 56:25.214
didn't like the way the
other one looked on me.

56:25.297 --> 56:26.964
Sure, and that one
suits you, Mr. Eastwood.

56:27.046 --> 56:28.880
It's very becoming.
Oh, thanks.

56:30.087 --> 56:33.006
Hey, "Frisbie. "
Far out.

56:35.753 --> 56:37.086
What was the meaning
of that?

56:37.211 --> 56:38.795
It was right in front of him. Aye.

56:38.879 --> 56:41.047
Swing that partner
halfway round

56:41.128 --> 56:43.421
Sashay back to
the head of the set

56:43.503 --> 56:46.463
All the way up to
the head of the set

56:46.545 --> 56:49.297
Now, bow to the partner
You're through

56:53.545 --> 56:55.129
Hey, that's mine!
Not anymore.

56:55.211 --> 56:56.503
Give me that.

56:56.586 --> 56:58.045
There he is, Buford.

56:59.376 --> 57:00.877
Where?
There.

57:00.959 --> 57:03.461
Dancing with that
piece of calico.

57:03.543 --> 57:05.711
What are you
gonna do, boss?

57:07.625 --> 57:10.126
I figure if I bury
this muzzle

57:10.209 --> 57:12.919
deep enough in his back,
nobody will hear the shot.

57:13.001 --> 57:15.377
Careful, Buford. You ain't
got but one bullet with that.

57:15.459 --> 57:17.251
I only need one.

57:28.999 --> 57:30.875
I told you to watch
your back, smithy.

57:30.957 --> 57:33.167
Tannen, you're early.

57:33.247 --> 57:35.624
It's a Derringer, smithy.
Small but effective.

57:35.707 --> 57:38.417
The last time I used it, fellow
took two whole days to die.

57:38.499 --> 57:39.499
Bled to death inside.

57:39.581 --> 57:41.290
It was real,
real painful.

57:41.373 --> 57:45.001
That means you'll be dead
by about supper time Monday.

57:45.081 --> 57:48.459
Excuse me. I don't know who you
think you are, but we're dancing.

57:48.539 --> 57:50.665
Well, look at what
we have here.

57:50.748 --> 57:52.290
Ain't you gonna
introduce me to the lady?

57:52.374 --> 57:53.416
I'd like a dance.

57:53.498 --> 57:54.748
I wouldn't give
you the pleasure.

57:54.831 --> 57:57.249
You'll just have to
go ahead and shoot.

57:57.331 --> 57:58.331
All right.

57:58.414 --> 57:59.581
No, no. Emmett,
I'll dance with him.

57:59.663 --> 58:01.456
Boys, keep the
blacksmith company

58:01.538 --> 58:03.456
while I get acquainted
with the filly!

58:09.663 --> 58:13.082
I don't dance very well when my
partner has a gun in his hand.

58:13.162 --> 58:15.663
You'll learn.
You'll learn.

58:15.746 --> 58:18.998
You know, smithy, maybe I'll
just take my $80 worth out of her!

58:19.078 --> 58:20.287
Tannen,
leave her alone!

58:21.702 --> 58:23.411
Whoo!

58:24.037 --> 58:27.498
Yeah, I bet there's something
you can do that's worth $80.

58:28.787 --> 58:31.288
I believe you've
underestimated me, mister.

58:31.369 --> 58:32.828
Have I?

58:36.701 --> 58:37.951
Ow!

58:40.285 --> 58:43.287
Stop it!
Damn you, Tannen!

58:43.368 --> 58:45.787
No, I damn you!

58:47.285 --> 58:49.953
I damn you to hell!

58:56.576 --> 58:57.743
You.

58:57.825 --> 58:59.409
Hey, lighten up, jerk!

59:03.533 --> 59:05.493
Mighty strong words,
runt!

59:05.574 --> 59:07.033
You man enough
to back them up

59:07.116 --> 59:09.618
with more than
just a pie plate?

59:11.991 --> 59:15.118
Look, just leave
my friends alone.

59:15.200 --> 59:17.659
What's wrong, dude?
You yellow?

59:25.198 --> 59:28.074
That's what I thought.
A yellow belly.

59:34.198 --> 59:37.074
Nobody calls me yellow.

59:37.696 --> 59:40.990
Then let's
finish it right now.

59:41.071 --> 59:43.823
Not now, Buford.
Marshal's got our guns.

59:43.903 --> 59:46.029
Like I said,
we'll finish this tomorrow!

59:46.112 --> 59:49.406
Tomorrow we're robbing
the Pine City stage.

59:49.490 --> 59:51.949
What about Monday?
We doing anything Monday?

59:52.029 --> 59:53.988
No, Monday would be fine.
You can kill him on Monday.

59:54.070 --> 59:56.322
I'll be back
this way on Monday.

59:56.403 --> 59:57.987
We'll settle this then.

59:58.070 --> 01:00:00.781
Right there
out in the street

01:00:00.861 --> 01:00:02.195
in front of
the Palace Saloon.

01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:05.905
Yeah, right. When?

01:00:05.987 --> 01:00:07.863
High noon?
Noon?

01:00:08.361 --> 01:00:12.156
I do my killing
before breakfast. 7:00!

01:00:14.693 --> 01:00:19.405
8:00. I do my killing
after breakfast.

01:00:19.486 --> 01:00:20.861
Marty!

01:00:25.567 --> 01:00:26.609
All right, now.
Break it up.

01:00:26.692 --> 01:00:27.734
What's all this about?

01:00:27.817 --> 01:00:30.527
You causing
trouble here, Tannen?

01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:32.319
No trouble, Marshal.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.694
Just a little personal matter
between me and Eastwood.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.692
This don't
concern the law.

01:00:37.776 --> 01:00:40.652
Tonight, everything concerns
the law. Now break it up.

01:00:40.733 --> 01:00:44.152
Any brawling, it's 15
days in the county jail.

01:00:44.232 --> 01:00:46.442
All right, folks.
Come on, this is a party.

01:00:46.524 --> 01:00:48.484
Come on!
Let's have some fun!

01:00:53.733 --> 01:00:55.942
8:00 Monday, runt.

01:00:56.024 --> 01:00:57.441
If you ain't here,

01:00:57.524 --> 01:01:01.402
I'll hunt you and shoot
you down like a duck.

01:01:01.482 --> 01:01:04.650
It's "dog," Buford.
Shoot him down like a dog.

01:01:04.731 --> 01:01:09.359
Let's go, boys! Let these
sissies have their party!

01:01:10.607 --> 01:01:11.607
Marty,
what are you doing,

01:01:11.689 --> 01:01:13.064
saying you're
gonna meet Tannen?

01:01:13.147 --> 01:01:15.148
Hey, Doc, Doc,
don't worry about it.

01:01:15.229 --> 01:01:16.271
Monday morning 8:00 a. m.

01:01:16.355 --> 01:01:17.689
We're gonna
be gone, right?

01:01:17.772 --> 01:01:20.732
Theoretically, yes, but
what if the train's late?

01:01:20.813 --> 01:01:22.230
Late? We'll discuss this later.

01:01:22.313 --> 01:01:23.480
No, we'll discuss it now.
Late? What do you mean?

01:01:23.564 --> 01:01:24.773
Thank you for your
gallantry, Mr. Eastwood.

01:01:24.856 --> 01:01:26.106
Hey, ma'am.

01:01:26.189 --> 01:01:28.565
Had you not interceded,
Emmett might have been shot.

01:01:28.645 --> 01:01:31.397
Marty... Clint, I'm
gonna take Clara home.

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.813
Right. Good night,
Doc. Good night, Clara.

01:01:32.896 --> 01:01:34.605
You sure set him straight,
Mr. Eastwood.

01:01:34.686 --> 01:01:35.770
I'm glad somebody
finally got the gumption

01:01:35.854 --> 01:01:37.521
to stand up to
that son of a bitch.

01:01:37.603 --> 01:01:39.061
You're all right in
my book, Mr. Eastwood.

01:01:39.145 --> 01:01:40.353
I'd like to
buy you a drink.

01:01:40.436 --> 01:01:41.436
Hey, listen,
I don't want a drink.

01:01:41.519 --> 01:01:43.228
You don't have to buy me
anything. Young man. Young man.

01:01:43.311 --> 01:01:45.270
It was no big deal. I'd like
for you to have this brand-new

01:01:45.352 --> 01:01:48.396
Colt Peacemaker and
gun belt free of charge.

01:01:49.686 --> 01:01:50.770
Free?

01:01:50.853 --> 01:01:52.270
I want everybody
to know

01:01:52.351 --> 01:01:56.146
that the gun that shot Buford
Tannen was a Colt Peacemaker!

01:01:56.228 --> 01:01:59.022
Hey, no problem.
Thanks a lot.

01:01:59.104 --> 01:02:00.521
Of course
you understand

01:02:00.602 --> 01:02:02.978
that if you lose,
I'm taking it back.

01:02:06.186 --> 01:02:07.686
Thanks again.

01:02:10.975 --> 01:02:12.601
You had him,
Mr. Eastwood.

01:02:12.685 --> 01:02:13.769
You could have
just walked away,

01:02:13.850 --> 01:02:16.101
and nobody would have thought
the less of you for it.

01:02:16.184 --> 01:02:20.395
All it would have been was
words, hot air from a buffoon.

01:02:20.475 --> 01:02:22.142
Instead,
you let him rile you.

01:02:22.225 --> 01:02:26.270
Rile you into playing his
game, his way, by his rules.

01:02:26.348 --> 01:02:28.725
Seamus, relax.
I know what I'm doing.

01:02:28.808 --> 01:02:29.808
He reminds me
of poor Martin.

01:02:29.892 --> 01:02:30.892
Aye.

01:02:30.975 --> 01:02:32.142
Who?
Me brother.

01:02:32.225 --> 01:02:33.267
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

01:02:33.347 --> 01:02:35.390
You have a brother
named Martin McFly?

01:02:35.473 --> 01:02:37.891
Had a brother.

01:02:37.973 --> 01:02:40.641
Martin used to let men
provoke him into fighting.

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:43.600
He was concerned that people would
think him a coward if he refused.

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.056
That's how he got a Bowie
knife shoved through his belly

01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:49.017
in a saloon
in Virginia City.

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:50.933
Never considered
the future, poor Martin.

01:02:51.014 --> 01:02:52.931
God rest his soul.

01:02:54.430 --> 01:02:58.266
Sure, and I hope you're considering
the future, Mr. Eastwood.

01:03:01.513 --> 01:03:04.015
I think about it
all the time.

01:03:04.890 --> 01:03:06.599
And that crater
in the middle north west,

01:03:06.679 --> 01:03:08.597
the one that's out there all
by itself like a starburst...

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:09.722
Uh-huh.

01:03:09.804 --> 01:03:12.055
...that one's
called Copernicus.

01:03:13.055 --> 01:03:15.515
Listen to me. I feel
like I'm teaching school.

01:03:16.679 --> 01:03:19.181
Please,
continue the lesson.

01:03:19.262 --> 01:03:22.264
I never found lunar
geography so fascinating.

01:03:22.345 --> 01:03:24.430
You're quite
knowledgeable.

01:03:24.512 --> 01:03:26.263
When I was 11,
I had diphtheria.

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:28.345
I was quarantined
for three months.

01:03:28.428 --> 01:03:30.512
So my father
brought this telescope,

01:03:30.594 --> 01:03:31.969
and he put it
next to my bed

01:03:32.050 --> 01:03:34.594
so I could see
everything out the window.

01:03:35.761 --> 01:03:39.096
Emmett, do you think we'll ever
be able to travel to the moon

01:03:39.177 --> 01:03:42.262
the way we travel across
the country on trains?

01:03:42.343 --> 01:03:45.763
Definitely. Although not for
84 years and not on trains.

01:03:45.843 --> 01:03:49.679
We'll have space vehicles,
capsules sent aloft with rockets.

01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.594
Devices that
create giant explosions.

01:03:51.675 --> 01:03:54.093
Explosions so powerful
that they just...

01:03:54.177 --> 01:03:56.261
That they break the pull
of the Earth's gravity

01:03:56.342 --> 01:03:59.595
and send the projectile
through outer space.

01:04:01.009 --> 01:04:03.385
Emmett,
I read that book, too!

01:04:03.467 --> 01:04:05.468
You're quoting
Jules Verne

01:04:05.551 --> 01:04:07.010
From the Earth
to the Moon.

01:04:07.092 --> 01:04:09.343
You've read Jules Verne?

01:04:10.135 --> 01:04:12.052
I adore Jules Verne.

01:04:12.133 --> 01:04:13.759
So do I.

01:04:13.842 --> 01:04:16.719
Twenty Thousand Leagues Under
the Sea. My absolute favorite.

01:04:16.798 --> 01:04:18.716
The first time I read that
when I was a little boy,

01:04:18.798 --> 01:04:21.383
why, I wanted to
meet Captain Nemo.

01:04:21.465 --> 01:04:22.631
Don't tease, Emmett.

01:04:22.716 --> 01:04:24.592
You couldn't have read
that when you were a boy.

01:04:24.674 --> 01:04:27.092
It was only first
published 10 years ago.

01:04:27.339 --> 01:04:31.217
Oh, yes. Well, I meant it
made me feel like a boy.

01:04:33.506 --> 01:04:38.135
I never met a woman who
liked Jules Verne before.

01:04:40.173 --> 01:04:43.592
I never ever met a man
like you before.

01:05:35.916 --> 01:05:42.922
Doc?

01:05:45.916 --> 01:05:48.293
Hope you know
what you're doing.

01:06:01.498 --> 01:06:03.332
You talking to me?

01:06:05.998 --> 01:06:08.332
You talking to me,
Tannen?

01:06:12.165 --> 01:06:14.750
Well, I'm the
only one here.

01:06:14.829 --> 01:06:18.498
Go ahead,
make my day.

01:06:24.997 --> 01:06:26.497
Say good morning,
Mr. Eastwood.

01:06:26.581 --> 01:06:27.873
Morning.

01:06:27.954 --> 01:06:29.580
Have a cigar,
Mr. Eastwood.

01:06:29.662 --> 01:06:32.164
Anything I can do for
you today, Mr. Eastwood?

01:06:32.246 --> 01:06:33.788
No, that's fine.

01:06:33.871 --> 01:06:35.413
Good luck tomorrow,
Mr. Eastwood.

01:06:35.496 --> 01:06:37.080
We'll be praying
for you.

01:06:37.162 --> 01:06:38.203
Thanks.

01:06:39.495 --> 01:06:41.580
Good morning,
Mr. Eastwood.

01:06:41.661 --> 01:06:43.662
Interest you in a new suit for tomorrow?

01:06:45.703 --> 01:06:47.704
I'm fine. Thanks.

01:06:58.828 --> 01:07:00.912
Doc, what are
you doing?

01:07:00.994 --> 01:07:02.369
Oh, nothing.

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:05.035
I was just out
enjoying the morning air.

01:07:05.119 --> 01:07:07.454
It's really lovely here in
the morning. Don't you think?

01:07:07.535 --> 01:07:08.577
Yeah, it's lovely, Doc.

01:07:08.659 --> 01:07:09.909
So listen, we've got
to load the DeLorean up

01:07:09.993 --> 01:07:11.577
and get ready
to roll, all right?

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:14.162
Hey, look at that,
the tombstone.

01:07:15.868 --> 01:07:18.745
Marty, let me see
that photograph again.

01:07:20.534 --> 01:07:23.327
My name,
it's vanished.

01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:25.786
Hey, that's great, Doc.
Don't you get it?

01:07:25.867 --> 01:07:26.950
We're going back to
the future tomorrow,

01:07:27.033 --> 01:07:28.367
so everything's
being erased.

01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:30.242
But only my name
is erased.

01:07:30.324 --> 01:07:32.075
The tombstone itself
and the date still remain.

01:07:32.159 --> 01:07:34.076
That doesn't
make sense.

01:07:34.157 --> 01:07:36.742
We know that this photograph
represents what will happen

01:07:36.823 --> 01:07:38.240
if the events
of today continue

01:07:38.324 --> 01:07:40.159
to run their course
into tomorrow.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.240
Right. So?

01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:42.574
Excuse me,
Mr. Eastwood.

01:07:42.657 --> 01:07:44.074
I just need to take
your measurements.

01:07:44.157 --> 01:07:46.199
Oh, look, pal, I don't
want to buy a suit.

01:07:47.364 --> 01:07:49.490
No, this is
for your coffin.

01:07:49.573 --> 01:07:50.614
My coffin?

01:07:50.698 --> 01:07:53.158
Well, the odds are running
two to one against you.

01:07:53.238 --> 01:07:55.573
Might as well
be prepared.

01:07:55.656 --> 01:07:59.117
So it may not be my name that's
supposed to end up on this tombstone.

01:07:59.195 --> 01:08:00.946
It may be yours.

01:08:02.196 --> 01:08:03.238
Great Scott.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:04.279
I know.
This is heavy.

01:08:04.363 --> 01:08:06.322
Marty, why are you
wearing that gun?

01:08:06.404 --> 01:08:08.488
You're not considering going
up against Tannen tomorrow?

01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:11.405
Doc, tomorrow morning I'm going
back to the future with you.

01:08:11.487 --> 01:08:13.238
But if Buford Tannen
comes looking for trouble,

01:08:13.322 --> 01:08:14.906
I'm gonna be
ready for him.

01:08:14.988 --> 01:08:17.363
You heard what that son of
a bitch called me last night.

01:08:17.447 --> 01:08:18.697
Marty, you can't go
losing your judgment

01:08:18.778 --> 01:08:20.237
every time someone
calls you a name.

01:08:20.319 --> 01:08:21.319
That's exactly
what causes you

01:08:21.404 --> 01:08:24.656
to get into that accident
in the future.

01:08:25.987 --> 01:08:29.740
What?
What about my future?

01:08:29.821 --> 01:08:32.948
I can't tell you. It
might make things worse.

01:08:33.026 --> 01:08:36.821
Wait a minute. Doc, what
is wrong with my future?

01:08:37.736 --> 01:08:39.944
Marty, we all have to make decisions

01:08:40.026 --> 01:08:42.403
that affect
the course of our lives.

01:08:42.484 --> 01:08:45.404
You've got to do
what you've got to do,

01:08:45.484 --> 01:08:47.319
and I've got to do
what I've got to do.

01:08:58.817 --> 01:09:00.859
Marty.
Yeah.

01:09:00.942 --> 01:09:02.734
I've made a decision.
Uh-huh.

01:09:02.817 --> 01:09:03.859
I'm not going
with you tomorrow.

01:09:05.024 --> 01:09:06.734
I'm staying here.

01:09:10.107 --> 01:09:12.942
What are you
talking about, Doc?

01:09:13.022 --> 01:09:14.898
There's no point
in denying it.

01:09:14.982 --> 01:09:16.064
I'm in love with Clara.

01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:17.524
Oh, man.

01:09:17.608 --> 01:09:21.694
Doc, we don't belong
here. Neither one of us.

01:09:21.773 --> 01:09:24.649
You know, it could still be
you that gets shot tomorrow.

01:09:24.732 --> 01:09:27.274
This tombstone could
still be in your future.

01:09:27.356 --> 01:09:30.692
Marty, the future
isn't written.

01:09:30.772 --> 01:09:33.189
It can be changed.
You know that.

01:09:34.606 --> 01:09:38.276
Anyone can make their future
whatever they want it to be.

01:09:38.354 --> 01:09:40.064
I can't let this
one little photograph

01:09:40.148 --> 01:09:42.733
determine
my entire destiny.

01:09:42.813 --> 01:09:44.063
I have to
live my life

01:09:44.147 --> 01:09:47.983
according to what I believe
is right in my heart.

01:09:50.313 --> 01:09:53.189
Doc, you're a scientist.

01:09:55.146 --> 01:09:59.649
So you tell me. What's the
right thing to do up here?

01:10:13.477 --> 01:10:14.853
You're right, Marty.

01:10:37.726 --> 01:10:38.892
Wow, that worked great.

01:10:38.976 --> 01:10:41.894
I've at least got
to tell her goodbye.

01:10:42.808 --> 01:10:45.768
Come on, Doc.
Think about it.

01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:47.225
What are you
gonna say to her?

01:10:47.308 --> 01:10:48.726
"I've got to go
back to the future?"

01:10:48.808 --> 01:10:51.059
I mean, she's not gonna
understand that, Doc.

01:10:51.141 --> 01:10:52.182
Hell, I'm in it
with you,

01:10:52.265 --> 01:10:54.808
and I don't
even understand it.

01:10:57.392 --> 01:11:00.352
Doc, listen.

01:11:01.639 --> 01:11:03.223
Maybe we...

01:11:03.306 --> 01:11:06.684
I don't know, maybe we can
just take Clara with us.

01:11:07.763 --> 01:11:09.305
To the future?

01:11:13.557 --> 01:11:16.225
As you reminded me,
Marty, I'm a scientist,

01:11:16.304 --> 01:11:18.973
so I must be
scientific about this.

01:11:19.055 --> 01:11:20.889
I cautioned you about
disrupting the continuum

01:11:20.971 --> 01:11:22.304
for your own
personal benefit.

01:11:22.387 --> 01:11:24.638
Therefore,
I must do no less.

01:11:24.722 --> 01:11:25.847
We shall proceed
as planned,

01:11:25.932 --> 01:11:27.891
and as soon as
we return to 1985,

01:11:27.973 --> 01:11:31.475
we'll destroy this
infernal machine.

01:11:31.555 --> 01:11:35.015
Traveling through time has
become much too painful.

01:12:05.427 --> 01:12:07.219
It's Emmett, Clara.

01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:14.052
Emmett,
won't you come in?

01:12:14.135 --> 01:12:17.262
No, I better not. I...

01:12:19.507 --> 01:12:20.799
What's wrong?

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:23.843
I've come
to say goodbye.

01:12:25.632 --> 01:12:28.134
Goodbye? Well,
where are you going?

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.718
I'm going away.

01:12:30.801 --> 01:12:33.469
And well, I'm afraid
I'll never see you again.

01:12:34.966 --> 01:12:36.299
Emmett!

01:12:36.382 --> 01:12:41.594
Clara, I want you to know
that I care about you deeply.

01:12:42.633 --> 01:12:44.300
But I've realized that
I don't belong here,

01:12:44.382 --> 01:12:48.051
and I have to go back
where I came from.

01:12:48.133 --> 01:12:50.676
And where
might that be?

01:12:50.757 --> 01:12:52.466
I can't tell you.

01:12:54.756 --> 01:12:58.551
Well, wherever you're
going, take me with you.

01:12:59.879 --> 01:13:02.131
I can't, Clara.

01:13:02.212 --> 01:13:03.546
I wish it didn't
have to be this way,

01:13:03.631 --> 01:13:05.173
but just believe me
when I tell you

01:13:05.254 --> 01:13:09.674
that I'll never forget you
and that I love you.

01:13:11.837 --> 01:13:14.088
I don't understand what
you're trying to say.

01:13:14.171 --> 01:13:18.091
Clara, I don't think there's any
way that you can understand it.

01:13:18.795 --> 01:13:21.171
Please, Emmett.
Please, I have to know.

01:13:21.254 --> 01:13:22.879
If you sincerely
do love me,

01:13:22.963 --> 01:13:24.296
then tell me
the truth.

01:13:26.377 --> 01:13:28.044
All right then.

01:13:29.085 --> 01:13:30.293
I'm from the future.

01:13:32.335 --> 01:13:35.337
I came here in a time
machine that I invented,

01:13:35.421 --> 01:13:39.465
and tomorrow I have to
go back to the year 1985.

01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:47.127
Yes, Emmett.

01:13:48.542 --> 01:13:50.209
I do understand.

01:13:52.793 --> 01:13:55.128
I understand that
because you know

01:13:55.209 --> 01:13:57.502
I'm partial to the
writings of Jules Verne,

01:13:57.583 --> 01:13:59.000
you concocted
those mendacities

01:13:59.083 --> 01:14:01.126
in order to take
advantage of me.

01:14:02.084 --> 01:14:04.544
Oh! I've heard some
whoppers in my day,

01:14:04.625 --> 01:14:05.750
but the fact
that you'd expect me

01:14:05.833 --> 01:14:07.125
to entertain
a notion like that

01:14:07.208 --> 01:14:09.960
is so insulting
and degrading!

01:14:11.749 --> 01:14:13.542
All you had to say is,
"I don't love you,

01:14:13.624 --> 01:14:15.709
"and I don't want
to see you anymore. "

01:14:15.791 --> 01:14:18.251
That, at least, would
have been respectful!

01:14:18.997 --> 01:14:20.331
But that's
not the truth.

01:14:59.955 --> 01:15:01.831
Good to
see you, too.

01:15:03.120 --> 01:15:06.664
Emmett. What can I get you? The usual?

01:15:06.744 --> 01:15:08.328
No, Chester, I'm gonna need something

01:15:08.411 --> 01:15:10.537
a lot stronger
than that tonight.

01:15:10.618 --> 01:15:12.035
Sarsaparilla.

01:15:12.119 --> 01:15:13.494
Whiskey, Chester.

01:15:14.370 --> 01:15:16.788
Whiskey?
Emmett, are you sure?

01:15:16.868 --> 01:15:19.203
You know what happened to
you on the Fourth of July.

01:15:19.284 --> 01:15:20.493
Whiskey.

01:15:21.867 --> 01:15:25.078
Okay, I ain't your papa.

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:28.413
Just don't want to see
you do the wrong thing.

01:15:29.743 --> 01:15:31.786
You can leave
the bottle.

01:15:33.618 --> 01:15:35.452
It's a woman, right?

01:15:37.117 --> 01:15:39.368
I knew it. I have seen
that look on a man's face

01:15:39.450 --> 01:15:42.327
a thousand times
all across the country.

01:15:42.409 --> 01:15:44.743
All I can tell you, friend,
is you'll get over her.

01:15:44.825 --> 01:15:48.285
Oh... Clara was
one in a million.

01:15:49.325 --> 01:15:53.578
One in a billion.
One in a googolplex.

01:15:53.659 --> 01:15:57.286
The woman of my dreams, and
I've lost her for all time.

01:15:58.574 --> 01:16:02.035
I can assure you, sir,
there are other women.

01:16:02.116 --> 01:16:04.742
Why, peddling this barbed
wire all across the country

01:16:04.824 --> 01:16:07.158
has taught me
one thing for certain,

01:16:07.239 --> 01:16:10.199
is that you never know
what the future might bring.

01:16:10.281 --> 01:16:14.159
The future. Oh, I can
tell you about the future.

01:16:24.613 --> 01:16:26.572
Oh, man, did I sleep.

01:16:29.613 --> 01:16:31.447
What time is it, Doc?

01:16:35.445 --> 01:16:36.612
Doc?

01:16:47.945 --> 01:16:49.195
Wake up!

01:16:50.945 --> 01:16:52.862
Get up! Let's go!

01:16:54.112 --> 01:16:56.113
I got me
a runt to kill.

01:16:56.194 --> 01:16:59.154
It's still early, boss.
What's your hurry?

01:17:00.194 --> 01:17:01.486
I'm hungry.

01:17:02.277 --> 01:17:05.321
And in the future,
we don't need horses.

01:17:07.026 --> 01:17:10.445
We have motorized carriages
called automobiles.

01:17:11.610 --> 01:17:14.987
If everybody's got one
of these auto whatsits,

01:17:15.068 --> 01:17:17.486
does anybody walk
or run anymore?

01:17:18.151 --> 01:17:22.071
Of course we run, but
for recreation, for fun.

01:17:22.149 --> 01:17:25.819
Run for fun? What the
hell kind of fun is that?

01:17:36.065 --> 01:17:38.274
Doc! Doc!

01:17:45.107 --> 01:17:46.899
How much
has he had?

01:17:46.981 --> 01:17:48.691
None.
That's the first one,

01:17:48.774 --> 01:17:50.274
and he hasn't
touched it yet.

01:17:51.106 --> 01:17:52.690
He just likes
to hold it.

01:17:56.232 --> 01:17:59.192
Doc! Doc!
What are you doing?

01:18:00.189 --> 01:18:03.483
I've lost her, Marty. There's
nothing left for me here.

01:18:03.563 --> 01:18:05.481
All right, that's why you
gotta come back with me.

01:18:05.562 --> 01:18:06.521
Where?

01:18:06.604 --> 01:18:07.813
Back to the future!

01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:14.021
Right!
Let's get going!

01:18:14.106 --> 01:18:15.189
Great.

01:18:15.271 --> 01:18:18.440
Gentlemen, excuse me, but my
friend and I have to catch a train.

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.229
Here's to you,
blacksmith.

01:18:20.312 --> 01:18:21.604
And to the future.

01:18:21.687 --> 01:18:22.728
Amen.

01:18:23.187 --> 01:18:24.771
Amen.
Emmett, no!

01:18:32.936 --> 01:18:35.896
Doc! Doc! Doc!

01:18:36.810 --> 01:18:39.853
Come on, Doc.
Wake up. Wake up, Doc!

01:18:40.894 --> 01:18:41.852
How many did he have?

01:18:41.935 --> 01:18:43.060
Just the one.

01:18:43.141 --> 01:18:45.267
Just the one?
Come on, Doc.

01:18:45.351 --> 01:18:47.602
There's a fellow that
can't hold his liquor.

01:18:47.686 --> 01:18:49.353
Get me some coffee.
Black!

01:18:49.436 --> 01:18:50.561
Joey, coffee!

01:19:00.557 --> 01:19:02.684
Ma'am?

01:19:02.767 --> 01:19:04.685
How far does
the 8:00 train go?

01:19:04.768 --> 01:19:07.103
San Francisco is
the end of the line.

01:19:08.767 --> 01:19:10.935
I'll take
a one-way ticket.

01:19:12.266 --> 01:19:14.309
You want to sober him
up in a hurry, son,

01:19:14.391 --> 01:19:16.350
you're gonna have to use something
a lot stronger than coffee.

01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:19.057
Yeah,
what do you suggest?

01:19:19.141 --> 01:19:22.519
Joey, let's make
some wake-up juice.

01:19:22.597 --> 01:19:25.099
Come on, Doc, swallow.
Here we go.

01:19:30.181 --> 01:19:32.182
In about 10 minutes,

01:19:32.264 --> 01:19:35.266
he's gonna be as sober
as a priest on Sunday.

01:19:36.306 --> 01:19:37.473
Ten minutes!

01:19:37.555 --> 01:19:40.015
Why do we have to cut
these things so damn close?

01:19:40.097 --> 01:19:42.807
Here, stick this
clothespin on his nose.

01:19:44.679 --> 01:19:46.763
When he opens up
his mouth,

01:19:46.844 --> 01:19:50.305
go ahead and pour it on down his gullet.

01:19:50.389 --> 01:19:52.098
Oh, and stand back.

01:20:10.553 --> 01:20:11.553
He's still out!

01:20:11.636 --> 01:20:13.845
Oh, that? That was
just a reflex action.

01:20:13.928 --> 01:20:15.345
It's gonna take
a few more minutes

01:20:15.427 --> 01:20:17.261
for the stuff to really
clear up his head.

01:20:17.344 --> 01:20:18.552
Perfect.

01:20:39.801 --> 01:20:41.927
Come on, Doc.
Come on, wake up, buddy.

01:20:42.008 --> 01:20:44.885
Wake up, Doc!
Come on. Come on.

01:20:44.965 --> 01:20:47.550
Seamus, wouldn't expect to
see you here this morning.

01:20:47.631 --> 01:20:51.592
Aye. Something inside me
told me I should be here

01:20:52.592 --> 01:20:55.761
as if my future had
something to do with it.

01:20:57.425 --> 01:20:59.885
He'll come around
in a minute. Come on.

01:20:59.964 --> 01:21:01.924
Come on, Doc.
Let's go, Doc!

01:21:02.007 --> 01:21:03.925
Let's wake up now, buddy.
Come on.

01:21:10.963 --> 01:21:13.256
Are you in there,
Eastwood?

01:21:15.214 --> 01:21:18.257
It's 8:00,
and I'm calling you out.

01:21:23.214 --> 01:21:24.881
It's not 8:00 yet!

01:21:25.296 --> 01:21:27.255
It is by my watch!

01:21:27.338 --> 01:21:30.256
Let's settle this
once and for all, runt!

01:21:31.922 --> 01:21:34.215
Or ain't you
got the gumption?

01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:44.919
Listen.

01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:50.255
I'm not really feeling up to this today.

01:21:51.836 --> 01:21:53.462
So I'm gonna
have to forfeit.

01:21:54.127 --> 01:21:56.420
Forfeit?

01:21:57.044 --> 01:21:58.795
What's that mean?

01:22:00.169 --> 01:22:02.170
It means that you win
without a fight.

01:22:02.252 --> 01:22:04.045
Without shooting?
He can't do that.

01:22:04.128 --> 01:22:06.254
Hey, you can't do that!

01:22:06.335 --> 01:22:07.835
You know what I think?

01:22:07.917 --> 01:22:11.252
I think you ain't nothing
but a gutless, yellow turd!

01:22:11.336 --> 01:22:13.796
And I'm giving you
to the count of 10

01:22:13.875 --> 01:22:16.001
to come out here
and prove I'm wrong!

01:22:16.919 --> 01:22:18.211
One!

01:22:18.292 --> 01:22:20.877
Doc, come on, sober up,
buddy. Let's go. Come on.

01:22:20.958 --> 01:22:22.000
Two!

01:22:22.084 --> 01:22:23.334
You better get
out there, son.

01:22:23.417 --> 01:22:26.544
I got $20 gold bet on
you, so don't let me down.

01:22:26.625 --> 01:22:27.833
Three!

01:22:27.917 --> 01:22:32.128
I got $30 gold bet against
you, so don't let me down.

01:22:32.207 --> 01:22:33.207
Four!

01:22:33.290 --> 01:22:35.249
You better face
up to it, son,

01:22:35.333 --> 01:22:37.751
because if you
don't go out there...

01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:39.289
What?
Five!

01:22:40.791 --> 01:22:42.375
What if I don't
go out there?

01:22:42.457 --> 01:22:43.707
You're a coward.

01:22:43.791 --> 01:22:44.874
Six!

01:22:44.956 --> 01:22:48.125
And you'll be branded a coward
for the rest of your days!

01:22:48.206 --> 01:22:52.334
Everybody everywhere
will say Clint Eastwood

01:22:52.414 --> 01:22:55.124
is the biggest yellow belly in the West!

01:23:00.247 --> 01:23:01.289
Seven!

01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:03.455
Here!

01:23:07.581 --> 01:23:08.748
Eight!

01:23:17.579 --> 01:23:18.788
I already got a gun.

01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:22.120
Nine!

01:23:26.952 --> 01:23:27.994
Ten!

01:23:33.079 --> 01:23:34.788
Do you hear me, runt?

01:23:34.869 --> 01:23:39.081
I said that's 10, you
gutless, yellow pie-slinger!

01:23:42.742 --> 01:23:44.993
He's an asshole!

01:23:45.076 --> 01:23:47.035
I don't care
what Tannen says!

01:23:47.117 --> 01:23:50.078
And I don't care what
anybody else says either.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:52.533
Doc! Doc, you okay?

01:23:52.617 --> 01:23:53.659
I think so.

01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:56.369
What a headache!

01:23:56.450 --> 01:23:58.201
Listen, you got a back
door to this place?

01:23:58.283 --> 01:23:59.325
Yeah, it's in the back.

01:23:59.407 --> 01:24:00.449
Let's go, Doc.

01:24:00.533 --> 01:24:04.078
Are you coming out here, or
do I have to come in after you?

01:24:05.992 --> 01:24:07.910
The thing I really
miss here is Tylenol.

01:24:08.782 --> 01:24:09.907
Hey!

01:24:15.907 --> 01:24:17.449
Reach, blacksmith!

01:24:34.406 --> 01:24:37.116
Yes, sir, that poor fellow last night

01:24:37.197 --> 01:24:41.158
had the worst case of broken
heart I have ever seen.

01:24:41.238 --> 01:24:42.489
When he said
he didn't know

01:24:42.571 --> 01:24:44.280
how he could live
the rest of his life

01:24:44.364 --> 01:24:47.157
knowing how much hurt he'd
caused that little girl.

01:24:47.238 --> 01:24:51.283
Well, I really felt for
him. I did. Right here.

01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:57.820
Listen up, Eastwood!

01:24:57.904 --> 01:24:59.446
I aim to shoot
somebody today,

01:24:59.529 --> 01:25:01.322
and I prefer
it'd be you.

01:25:01.403 --> 01:25:03.946
But if you're
just too damn yellow,

01:25:04.028 --> 01:25:06.488
I guess it'll just have to
be your blacksmith friend.

01:25:06.571 --> 01:25:08.989
Forget about me, Marty,
and save yourself!

01:25:14.026 --> 01:25:16.152
You got one minute
to decide.

01:25:16.235 --> 01:25:18.570
You hear me, runt?
One minute!

01:25:21.778 --> 01:25:24.780
I've never seen a man so
broken up over a woman.

01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:27.487
What did he say her
name was? Cara? Sara?

01:25:27.568 --> 01:25:29.110
Clara.
Clara.

01:25:32.402 --> 01:25:34.153
Excuse me.
Ma'am?

01:25:35.318 --> 01:25:38.654
But was this man tall with
great big, brown puppy-dog eyes

01:25:38.734 --> 01:25:41.235
and long silvery,
flowing hair?

01:25:41.317 --> 01:25:42.525
You know him.

01:25:45.399 --> 01:25:46.483
Emmett!

01:26:01.314 --> 01:26:03.190
Time's up, runt!

01:26:09.273 --> 01:26:12.108
Prepare to meet
your maker, blacksmith.

01:26:12.190 --> 01:26:13.982
Right here, Tannen!

01:26:51.726 --> 01:26:52.768
Draw!

01:26:56.102 --> 01:26:57.227
No!

01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:15.354
I thought we could
settle this like men.

01:27:16.894 --> 01:27:18.895
You thought wrong, dude.

01:27:41.057 --> 01:27:42.515
Thank you.

01:28:46.009 --> 01:28:47.760
That was good.

01:28:50.551 --> 01:28:52.510
You know what I think? No.

01:28:52.592 --> 01:28:53.800
I think Buford's
going to jail.

01:28:53.885 --> 01:28:55.010
Yeah.

01:29:00.675 --> 01:29:02.760
Get him out
of that shit.

01:29:02.841 --> 01:29:04.383
Get them!

01:29:08.383 --> 01:29:10.968
Buford Tannen,
you're under arrest

01:29:11.049 --> 01:29:13.008
for robbing
the Pine City stage.

01:29:13.090 --> 01:29:15.216
You got anything to say?

01:29:20.383 --> 01:29:22.176
I hate manure.

01:29:22.257 --> 01:29:23.299
Look!

01:29:27.050 --> 01:29:28.300
Yes!

01:29:29.757 --> 01:29:30.757
The train!

01:29:30.841 --> 01:29:32.050
Can we make it?

01:29:32.132 --> 01:29:34.050
We'll have to cut them
off at Coyote Pass.

01:29:36.548 --> 01:29:39.342
Hey! Hey, mister.
Mr. Eastwood.

01:29:39.424 --> 01:29:40.633
Here's your gun, mister.

01:29:40.715 --> 01:29:41.882
Thanks, kid.

01:29:47.213 --> 01:29:48.922
Seamus!

01:29:50.045 --> 01:29:52.004
It's worth $12.
Never been used.

01:29:53.422 --> 01:29:55.506
Maybe I'll trade it
for a new hat.

01:29:55.588 --> 01:29:57.922
Right, and take care of that baby!

01:29:59.129 --> 01:30:00.379
I will!

01:30:07.043 --> 01:30:14.674
Emmett!

01:30:19.544 --> 01:30:21.211
"Time machine. "

01:31:04.624 --> 01:31:05.624
Come on, Marty!

01:31:09.372 --> 01:31:10.372
Go, Doc.

01:31:10.455 --> 01:31:12.205
Come on.
Give me your hand!

01:31:47.662 --> 01:31:49.079
Come on, Marty.

01:31:53.577 --> 01:31:55.036
Come on. Let's go!

01:32:03.702 --> 01:32:05.036
Masks on.

01:32:20.201 --> 01:32:21.410
Reach!

01:32:21.492 --> 01:32:22.659
Is this a holdup?

01:32:24.657 --> 01:32:27.075
It's a science experiment.

01:32:27.158 --> 01:32:29.993
Stop the train just before you
hit the switch track up ahead.

01:32:45.823 --> 01:32:46.823
Doc!

01:32:46.907 --> 01:32:48.908
Uncouple the cars
from the tender!

01:33:15.696 --> 01:33:18.239
I've wanted to
do that all my life.

01:33:51.651 --> 01:33:52.901
What are these things,
anyway?

01:33:52.984 --> 01:33:54.818
My own version
of Pres-to-Logs.

01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:56.276
Compressed wood
with anthracite dust

01:33:56.358 --> 01:33:58.610
chemically treated to
burn hotter and longer.

01:33:58.693 --> 01:34:01.111
I use them in my forge
so I don't have to stoke it.

01:34:01.192 --> 01:34:03.193
These three in the furnace
will ignite sequentially,

01:34:03.275 --> 01:34:04.692
make the fire
burn hotter,

01:34:04.775 --> 01:34:05.942
kick up
the boiler pressure,

01:34:06.025 --> 01:34:07.400
and make the train
go faster.

01:34:19.273 --> 01:34:21.107
Ready to roll!

01:34:52.731 --> 01:34:54.023
Emmett!

01:34:58.688 --> 01:35:01.148
Marty, are the
time circuits on?

01:35:02.353 --> 01:35:03.353
Check, Doc!

01:35:04.021 --> 01:35:06.105
Input the destination time.

01:35:06.187 --> 01:35:09.898
October 27, 1985,
11:00 a. m.

01:35:11.311 --> 01:35:15.647
Check. Okay, we're cruising at
a steady 25 miles an hour, Doc.

01:35:15.726 --> 01:35:17.518
I'm throwing in
the Pres-to-Logs.

01:35:27.184 --> 01:35:28.977
Marty, the new gauge
on the dashboard

01:35:29.060 --> 01:35:30.644
will tell us
the boiler temperature.

01:35:30.725 --> 01:35:34.102
It's color-coded to indicate
when each log will fire.

01:35:34.182 --> 01:35:35.683
Green, yellow and red.

01:35:36.517 --> 01:35:38.101
Each detonation
will be accompanied

01:35:38.185 --> 01:35:40.020
by a sudden burst
of acceleration.

01:35:42.183 --> 01:35:44.101
Hopefully, we'll hit
88 miles per hour

01:35:44.184 --> 01:35:47.061
before the needle
gets much past 2,000.

01:35:47.142 --> 01:35:49.852
Why? What happens
after it hits 2,000?

01:35:49.933 --> 01:35:51.726
The whole boiler
explodes!

01:35:52.684 --> 01:35:53.767
Perfect!

01:36:09.723 --> 01:36:11.599
Hey, Doc!
We just hit 35!

01:36:11.681 --> 01:36:13.557
Okay, Marty.
I'm coming aboard!

01:36:24.347 --> 01:36:28.100
Emmett!

01:36:30.263 --> 01:36:31.847
Come on. Come on.

01:36:41.389 --> 01:36:42.806
You better hold
onto something, Doc!

01:36:42.889 --> 01:36:44.390
The yellow log
is about to blow!

01:36:49.637 --> 01:36:50.679
Golly.

01:36:54.344 --> 01:36:56.012
We just passed 40, Doc!

01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:30.269
Emmett!

01:37:32.675 --> 01:37:35.343
We just passed 45, Doc!
Go for it!

01:37:45.717 --> 01:37:46.717
Fifty.

01:37:57.838 --> 01:37:58.879
Emmett!

01:37:58.963 --> 01:37:59.963
Clara!

01:38:00.966 --> 01:38:02.383
I love you!

01:38:04.506 --> 01:38:06.799
Doc! Doc!
What's happening?

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:10.049
It's Clara!
She's on the train!

01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:12.046
Clara? Perfect.

01:38:12.672 --> 01:38:16.258
She's in the cab!
I'm going back for her!

01:38:16.336 --> 01:38:17.420
The windmill!

01:38:17.504 --> 01:38:21.424
Doc! The windmill! We're going
past 50! You'll never make it!

01:38:23.461 --> 01:38:25.296
Then we'll have to
take her back with us!

01:38:25.378 --> 01:38:27.879
Keep calling out
the speed!

01:38:27.961 --> 01:38:31.338
Clara,
climb out here to me!

01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:32.712
I don't know if I can!

01:38:32.794 --> 01:38:34.253
You can do it!

01:38:34.337 --> 01:38:36.463
Just don't look down!

01:38:39.919 --> 01:38:41.169
That's it!

01:38:55.335 --> 01:38:57.003
Sixty miles
an hour, Doc!

01:39:00.127 --> 01:39:03.296
You're doing fine!
Nice and steady!

01:39:06.668 --> 01:39:08.168
Come on!

01:39:08.875 --> 01:39:10.960
Just a little further!

01:39:11.041 --> 01:39:13.001
I can't, Emmett!
I'm scared!

01:39:15.499 --> 01:39:16.499
Seventy!

01:39:17.499 --> 01:39:19.250
Keep coming, Clara!

01:39:20.582 --> 01:39:23.625
Come on! Come on!
You're doing fine!

01:39:24.833 --> 01:39:28.544
Come on!
Nice and easy!

01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:32.625
Don't look down! That's
it! You're doing fine!

01:39:35.538 --> 01:39:39.666
Doc! The red log
is about to blow!

01:39:47.329 --> 01:39:48.329
Clara!

01:39:51.162 --> 01:39:52.830
Emmett!

01:40:02.704 --> 01:40:04.371
I'm trying
to reach you!

01:40:04.454 --> 01:40:05.705
Clara, hold on!

01:40:05.787 --> 01:40:06.996
I can't!

01:40:15.035 --> 01:40:16.077
Oh!

01:40:17.202 --> 01:40:19.036
Doc, I'm gonna slip you
the Hoverboard!

01:40:26.826 --> 01:40:28.326
Marty, watch out!

01:40:36.825 --> 01:40:38.325
Emmett, help!

01:40:40.991 --> 01:40:42.575
Hold on, Clara!

01:40:45.909 --> 01:40:47.493
Doc, ready, Doc?

01:40:48.741 --> 01:40:49.783
Catch it!

01:40:51.533 --> 01:40:52.783
Yes! Yes!

01:41:03.450 --> 01:41:04.701
Emmett!

01:41:04.782 --> 01:41:06.157
Hold on!

01:41:09.824 --> 01:41:10.824
Yes!

01:43:51.142 --> 01:43:52.476
Well, Doc,

01:43:54.185 --> 01:43:55.936
it's destroyed.

01:43:58.141 --> 01:44:00.142
Just like you wanted.

01:44:19.058 --> 01:44:20.141
Hey, butthead,
get away...

01:44:20.224 --> 01:44:21.224
Watch it, Biff!

01:44:21.307 --> 01:44:23.225
Marty, I didn't mean
to scare you.

01:44:23.307 --> 01:44:24.558
I didn't recognize you
in those clothes.

01:44:24.641 --> 01:44:26.058
What the hell
are you doing?

01:44:26.141 --> 01:44:28.893
Just putting on
the second coat now.

01:44:30.014 --> 01:44:31.390
You going cowboy, huh?

01:44:31.473 --> 01:44:34.183
Come on, guys. We're
gonna be late for brunch.

01:44:34.265 --> 01:44:35.265
Coming, Dave.

01:44:35.348 --> 01:44:36.640
Come on, Dad,
we're not gonna hold

01:44:36.722 --> 01:44:38.223
your reservations
all day.

01:44:38.306 --> 01:44:39.723
I can't
find my glasses.

01:44:39.806 --> 01:44:41.098
Lorraine, have you seen my glasses?

01:44:41.180 --> 01:44:43.223
They're in your
suede jacket, honey.

01:44:43.305 --> 01:44:45.974
Marty, what's wrong? We
thought you went to the lake.

01:44:46.054 --> 01:44:47.221
You wore that
to the lake?

01:44:47.303 --> 01:44:49.221
Thank God you guys
are all back to normal.

01:44:49.305 --> 01:44:51.306
Marty, who are you supposed
to be? Clint Eastwood?

01:44:52.638 --> 01:44:55.181
Right.
I gotta go get Jennifer.

01:44:59.429 --> 01:45:00.972
I really like
that hat, Marty.

01:45:01.052 --> 01:45:02.594
Thanks, Biff.

01:45:16.970 --> 01:45:18.303
Jennifer.

01:45:20.344 --> 01:45:21.594
Jen.

01:45:25.843 --> 01:45:27.135
Jennifer.

01:45:50.216 --> 01:45:54.261
Marty.

01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:57.676
I had the worst
nightmare.

01:46:04.131 --> 01:46:07.592
Marty, that dream
I had is so real.

01:46:07.672 --> 01:46:10.131
It was about
the future.

01:46:10.217 --> 01:46:12.218
About us.

01:46:12.299 --> 01:46:14.551
And you got fired.

01:46:14.632 --> 01:46:16.967
Wait a minute. What do
you mean I got fired?

01:46:17.881 --> 01:46:19.090
"Hilldale. "

01:46:20.382 --> 01:46:23.717
Hilldale!
This is where we live.

01:46:23.797 --> 01:46:26.799
I mean, this is where
we're going to live.

01:46:28.297 --> 01:46:29.339
Someday.

01:46:32.587 --> 01:46:35.798
Marty, it was a dream,
wasn't it?

01:46:39.671 --> 01:46:41.004
Hey.

01:46:41.087 --> 01:46:43.213
The big M.

01:46:43.296 --> 01:46:45.297
How's it hanging, McFly?

01:46:45.379 --> 01:46:46.629
Hey, Needles.

01:46:46.711 --> 01:46:50.839
Nice set of wheels.
Let's see what she can do.

01:46:50.919 --> 01:46:52.002
Next green light.

01:46:52.086 --> 01:46:53.127
No, thanks.

01:46:54.460 --> 01:46:57.003
What's the matter?
Chicken?

01:46:57.501 --> 01:46:59.043
Chicken McFly.

01:46:59.294 --> 01:47:00.253
Whoo!

01:47:01.670 --> 01:47:03.128
Marty, don't.

01:47:03.208 --> 01:47:04.625
Grab hold of something.

01:47:05.627 --> 01:47:07.336
Come on!
Get on!

01:47:08.752 --> 01:47:10.962
Yeah, go! Go, go, go!

01:47:33.584 --> 01:47:34.918
Did you
do that on purpose?

01:47:35.001 --> 01:47:37.461
Yeah, you think I'm stupid
enough to race that asshole?

01:47:43.665 --> 01:47:46.667
Jeez! I would have
hit that Rolls-Royce.

01:47:56.497 --> 01:47:58.289
It erased.

01:48:12.329 --> 01:48:14.205
You're right. There's not much left.

01:48:16.787 --> 01:48:18.829
Doc's never
coming back.

01:48:33.286 --> 01:48:34.912
I'm sure gonna
miss him, Jen.

01:48:47.576 --> 01:48:48.660
What the hell?

01:49:06.075 --> 01:49:07.200
Doc!

01:49:07.698 --> 01:49:08.782
Marty!

01:49:08.866 --> 01:49:11.034
Doc! Doc!

01:49:11.116 --> 01:49:13.993
Marty,
it runs on steam!

01:49:19.281 --> 01:49:22.784
Meet the family.
Clara, you know.

01:49:22.866 --> 01:49:24.033
Hi, Marty!

01:49:24.115 --> 01:49:25.199
Ma'am!

01:49:26.242 --> 01:49:28.409
These are our boys.

01:49:29.199 --> 01:49:32.993
Jules and Verne.

01:49:36.114 --> 01:49:38.950
Boys, this is Marty and Jennifer.

01:49:41.948 --> 01:49:43.907
Doc, I thought I'd
never see you again.

01:49:43.989 --> 01:49:46.199
You can't keep
a good scientist down.

01:49:46.279 --> 01:49:48.405
After all, I had to
come back for Einstein,

01:49:48.489 --> 01:49:51.783
and, well, I didn't want
you to be worried about me.

01:49:52.405 --> 01:49:53.405
Oh!

01:49:53.862 --> 01:49:56.322
I brought you
a little souvenir.

01:50:12.984 --> 01:50:16.153
It's great, Doc.
Thanks.

01:50:18.528 --> 01:50:22.364
Dr. Brown, I brought this
note back from the future,

01:50:22.443 --> 01:50:24.694
and now it's erased.

01:50:24.778 --> 01:50:26.737
Of course
it's erased.

01:50:28.652 --> 01:50:29.985
But what does
that mean?

01:50:30.070 --> 01:50:33.948
It means your future
hasn't been written yet.

01:50:34.027 --> 01:50:35.778
No one's has.

01:50:35.859 --> 01:50:38.277
Your future is
whatever you make it.

01:50:38.359 --> 01:50:40.902
So make it a good one,
both of you.

01:50:44.025 --> 01:50:45.234
We will, Doc!

01:50:45.317 --> 01:50:46.859
Stand back!

01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:49.444
All right, boys,
buckle up!

01:50:54.441 --> 01:50:59.612
Hey, Doc, where are you
going now? Back to the future?

01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:03.113
Nope! Already been there.
