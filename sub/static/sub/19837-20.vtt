<b>Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...</b>

00:09.020 --> 00:12.110
<b>Vast riches... Hidden treasures...</b>

00:14.570 --> 00:18.330
<b>Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...</b>

00:20.040 --> 00:23.150
<b>The word "unknown" holds magic.</b>

00:23.150 --> 00:27.080
<b>And some incredible people are 
drawn to that magic.</b>

00:27.490 --> 00:29.290
<b>They are known...</b>

00:33.220 --> 00:35.010
<b>...as Hunters!</b>

02:40.910 --> 02:45.890
<b>Baffling x Turn Of x Events</b>

02:48.460 --> 02:49.990
<b>You're awake?</b>

02:51.160 --> 02:52.380
<b>Where am I?</b>

02:52.840 --> 02:56.030
<b>A waiting room, next to the 
arena for the Final Phase.</b>

02:57.940 --> 03:00.470
<b>Upsie-daisy...</b>

03:01.620 --> 03:05.270
<b>Right. I was in the middle 
of the Hunter Exam.</b>

03:06.410 --> 03:08.880
<b>Your arm will heal quickly.</b>

03:08.880 --> 03:11.730
<b>The break was very clean.</b>

03:11.730 --> 03:16.240
<b>In fact, once it heals, the bone 
will be stronger than before.</b>

03:17.830 --> 03:19.050
<b>In any case,</b>

03:19.050 --> 03:21.590
<b>congratulations on passing the exam.</b>

03:27.510 --> 03:29.610
<b>Satotz-san, I...</b>

03:29.610 --> 03:30.430
<b>You can't.</b>

03:35.330 --> 03:39.650
<b>Just as someone who has failed 
the exam can no longer pass,</b>

03:39.650 --> 03:43.550
<b>someone who has passed 
the exam can no longer fail.</b>

03:44.440 --> 03:46.990
<b>The rest is up to you.</b>

03:47.440 --> 03:50.280
<b>If you feel you are unqualified to be a pro,</b>

03:50.280 --> 03:54.650
<b>you are free to destroy or 
put away your license.</b>

03:54.650 --> 03:56.960
<b>You can even sell it,</b>

03:56.960 --> 03:59.600
<b>since no one else will be able to use it.</b>

04:00.030 --> 04:01.130
<b>However,</b>

04:01.690 --> 04:07.140
<b>a person who has passed the exam will 
not be allowed to take it again.</b>

04:08.580 --> 04:10.840
<b>Professional Hunters are treated well,</b>

04:10.840 --> 04:14.020
<b>largely due to our predecessors' efforts.</b>

04:14.260 --> 04:20.150
<b>Hence, there are many applicants 
who harbor ill intentions.</b>

04:20.490 --> 04:22.650
<b>If it weren't for them,</b>

04:23.190 --> 04:27.290
<b>we would accept every person who applied.</b>

04:33.590 --> 04:35.740
<b>Most professional Hunters consider</b>

04:35.740 --> 04:39.850
<b>this card more valuable than their own lives,</b>

04:39.850 --> 04:43.490
<b>yet no more than a worthless scrap 
of paper at the same time.</b>

04:44.110 --> 04:45.300
<b>The important thing</b>

04:45.680 --> 04:49.930
<b>is what you accomplish once 
you become a Hunter.</b>

04:51.730 --> 04:54.180
<b>What I accomplish...</b>

04:55.770 --> 04:56.940
<b>Gon-kun,</b>

04:57.370 --> 05:00.590
<b>you can decide for yourself when 
you're ready to use this card.</b>

05:01.210 --> 05:03.430
<b>I have faith in your judgment.</b>

05:11.290 --> 05:12.410
<b>Okay.</b>

05:12.410 --> 05:16.830
<b>A lot of people helped me reach this point.</b>

05:17.180 --> 05:20.340
<b>I'll use this once I've returned the favor.</b>

05:20.950 --> 05:24.320
<b>Then allow me to congratulate you.</b>

05:24.870 --> 05:26.720
<b>Thank you, Satotz-san.</b>

05:29.850 --> 05:31.760
<b>What about the other applicants?</b>

05:31.760 --> 05:33.720
<b>The exam is still going on, right?</b>

05:35.460 --> 05:38.230
<b>No, the exam is over.</b>

05:39.330 --> 05:40.530
<b>Really?</b>

05:40.530 --> 05:44.410
<b>Yes, you slept for nearly an entire day.</b>

05:44.980 --> 05:46.300
<b>Really?</b>

05:46.300 --> 05:50.050
<b>The others who passed are currently 
completing a brief orientation.</b>

05:50.050 --> 05:52.770
<b>You will undergo the orientation later.</b>

05:53.230 --> 05:54.620
<b>Who failed?</b>

05:56.050 --> 05:57.870
<b>It was</b>

06:00.740 --> 06:02.220
<b>Killua.</b>

06:05.070 --> 06:08.130
<b>Why did Killua fail?</b>

06:09.130 --> 06:12.470
<b>First, let me fill you in on what transpired</b>

06:12.470 --> 06:14.420
<b>after you were knocked out.</b>

06:15.130 --> 06:18.020
<b>That will help you understand 
what occurred.</b>

06:22.300 --> 06:24.350
<b>After you fell unconscious...</b>

06:29.700 --> 06:33.410
<b>When he wakes up, he'll probably 
refuse his license.</b>

06:34.730 --> 06:37.540
<b>That sounds like something Gon would do.</b>

06:39.450 --> 06:41.970
<b>Only one person will fail this round, right?</b>

06:42.480 --> 06:48.420
<b>If Gon fails, wouldn't that make the 
rest of our fights meaningless?</b>

06:48.560 --> 06:51.680
<b>Don't worry. Gon has passed.</b>

06:51.980 --> 06:55.410
<b>Nothing he says can change that.</b>

06:57.220 --> 07:00.750
<b>If Gon were to throw a fit and kill me,</b>

07:00.750 --> 07:04.420
<b>we still wouldn't be able 
to revoke his license.</b>

07:04.420 --> 07:05.800
<b>Very well.</b>

07:09.920 --> 07:12.950
<b>Why did you let him win?</b>

07:14.540 --> 07:16.080
<b>Let him win?</b>

07:16.080 --> 07:20.710
<b>I'm sure you knew how to make Gon 
surrender without killing him.</b>

07:21.190 --> 07:22.330
<b>Given your skills.</b>

07:28.190 --> 07:30.690
<b>When I torture someone,</b>

07:30.690 --> 07:33.470
<b>I expect that person to hate me 
for the rest of their life.</b>

07:34.170 --> 07:36.850
<b>It's more effective and less stressful.</b>

07:37.400 --> 07:38.890
<b>When someone is in pain,</b>

07:38.890 --> 07:42.600
<b>their eyes show a gleam of hostility toward 
the one responsible for that pain.</b>

07:43.090 --> 07:46.370
<b>Even with extensive training,</b>

07:46.370 --> 07:48.980
<b>it is difficult to suppress 
that gleam of hate and rage.</b>

07:49.370 --> 07:52.240
<b>But there was no gleam in Gon's eyes.</b>

07:52.930 --> 07:55.060
<b>Can you believe it?</b>

07:55.060 --> 07:57.480
<b>I had just broken his arm.</b>

07:57.480 --> 08:02.210
<b>But his eyes had already 
forgotten about that.</b>

08:04.640 --> 08:07.880
<b>I guess you could say that he won me over.</b>

08:09.610 --> 08:12.630
<b>If you need a reason, there you go.</b>

08:16.210 --> 08:19.140
<b>Gon-kun, you were able to 
win over your opponent.</b>

08:19.690 --> 08:22.240
<b>Hanzo said so himself.</b>

08:24.950 --> 08:28.520
<b>After that, the second match began.</b>

08:29.030 --> 08:32.280
<b>The second match is Kurapika versus Hisoka.</b>

08:33.360 --> 08:34.030
<b>Begin!</b>

08:38.130 --> 08:41.160
<b>After the two of them fought for a while...</b>

08:45.330 --> 08:46.310
<b>Whaâ€”</b>

08:54.160 --> 08:55.580
<b>I lose.</b>

08:55.580 --> 08:56.300
<b>Huh?</b>

08:56.720 --> 08:59.650
<b>And Kurapika won.</b>

08:59.650 --> 09:01.310
<b>What did Hisoka say?</b>

09:01.610 --> 09:02.890
<b>I don't know,</b>

09:02.890 --> 09:07.060
<b>but Hisoka voluntarily conceded.</b>

09:07.480 --> 09:10.570
<b>The third match pit Hanzo against Pokkle.</b>

09:11.900 --> 09:15.280
<b>Pokkle found himself in much 
the same position as you,</b>

09:15.280 --> 09:18.570
<b>but he admitted defeat immediately.</b>

09:18.900 --> 09:21.560
<b>Sorry, but I won't go easy on you.</b>

09:22.520 --> 09:25.210
<b>That sealed the deal.</b>

09:26.100 --> 09:28.960
<b>The fourth match was between 
Hisoka and Bodoro.</b>

09:42.340 --> 09:44.640
<b>The match was extremely one-sided,</b>

09:45.040 --> 09:48.150
<b>but Bodoro refused to give up.</b>

09:52.230 --> 09:55.580
<b>However, while Bodoro 
was lying on the floor,</b>

09:55.580 --> 09:58.010
<b>Hisoka whispered something in his ear.</b>

09:59.500 --> 10:02.760
<b>And Bodoro surrendered.</b>

10:03.890 --> 10:06.540
<b>The fifth match featured Killua and Pokkle,</b>

10:06.540 --> 10:09.420
<b>but as soon as the fight began, 
Killua walked away.</b>

10:10.890 --> 10:13.660
<b>Confidently, he declared...</b>

10:14.590 --> 10:18.050
<b>Sorry, but I'm not interested in fighting you.</b>

10:18.730 --> 10:22.300
<b>He must have felt that he 
could win his next match.</b>

10:22.920 --> 10:24.180
<b>However,</b>

10:24.500 --> 10:27.150
<b>Leorio requested that the sixth match</b>

10:27.150 --> 10:30.270
<b>be postponed while Bodoro 
recovered from his injuries.</b>

10:30.770 --> 10:35.530
<b>So Killua and Gittarackur fought first.</b>

10:37.710 --> 10:38.530
<b>Begin!</b>

10:38.980 --> 10:43.260
<b>That was when Killua made a fatal mistake.</b>

10:55.510 --> 10:57.300
<b>It's been too long, Kil.</b>

11:33.520 --> 11:34.640
<b>Brother...</b>

11:38.070 --> 11:48.140
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

11:44.090 --> 11:48.140
<b>Illumi</b>

11:48.410 --> 11:52.340
<b>Huh? Gittarackur is Killua's brother?</b>

11:52.860 --> 11:56.480
<b>Yes, his name is Illumi.</b>

12:02.790 --> 12:03.830
<b>Hey.</b>

12:05.910 --> 12:07.930
<b>Killua's brother?</b>

12:07.930 --> 12:10.660
<b>He used those needles to change 
the shape of his face?!</b>

12:15.070 --> 12:17.670
<b>I heard that you cut up Mom and Milluki.</b>

12:18.090 --> 12:19.050
<b>I guess.</b>

12:19.760 --> 12:21.800
<b>Mom was crying.</b>

12:22.120 --> 12:26.180
<b>Anyone would cry if their 
son did that to them.</b>

12:26.430 --> 12:27.830
<b>Tears of joy.</b>

12:29.400 --> 12:32.940
<b>She was so happy to see that you'd grown up.</b>

12:33.400 --> 12:36.690
<b>But she was worried about you leaving home,</b>

12:36.690 --> 12:40.270
<b>so she asked me to check up on you.</b>

12:40.270 --> 12:41.440
<b>What a coincidence.</b>

12:42.180 --> 12:45.470
<b>I didn't know you wanted to be a Hunter.</b>

12:45.970 --> 12:50.810
<b>I'm trying to get a license for my next job.</b>

12:51.410 --> 12:54.590
<b>I don't really want to be a Hunter.</b>

12:54.590 --> 12:56.710
<b>I just felt like taking the exam.</b>

12:58.470 --> 12:59.530
<b>I see...</b>

13:00.180 --> 13:01.700
<b>That's a relief.</b>

13:02.010 --> 13:04.500
<b>Then I have some advice for you.</b>

13:06.090 --> 13:08.440
<b>You're not cut out to be a Hunter.</b>

13:09.710 --> 13:11.790
<b>You were born to be...</b>

13:15.160 --> 13:16.650
<b>a killer.</b>

13:23.810 --> 13:25.580
<b>Is that really what he said?</b>

13:27.600 --> 13:29.640
<b>Killua mentioned his family before,</b>

13:29.640 --> 13:31.270
<b>but they sound crazy...</b>

13:31.750 --> 13:34.120
<b>He wasn't finished yet.</b>

13:34.880 --> 13:37.880
<b>You're a puppet of darkness, without passion.</b>

13:37.880 --> 13:42.120
<b>You don't want anything or wish for anything.</b>

13:42.120 --> 13:44.260
<b>As one who lives in the shadows,</b>

13:44.260 --> 13:46.660
<b>you can only feel pleasure</b>

13:46.660 --> 13:49.140
<b>when people die.</b>

13:50.520 --> 13:54.080
<b>That's how Dad and I raised you.</b>

13:55.470 --> 13:59.270
<b>What would you accomplish 
by becoming a Hunter?</b>

14:01.130 --> 14:02.200
<b>True,</b>

14:02.830 --> 14:06.150
<b>I don't desire to become a Hunter.</b>

14:06.150 --> 14:07.290
<b>But...</b>

14:08.480 --> 14:11.660
<b>I do have something I want...</b>

14:12.000 --> 14:12.700
<b>You don't.</b>

14:12.700 --> 14:13.660
<b>I do!</b>

14:13.660 --> 14:15.720
<b>There's something I really want!</b>

14:17.700 --> 14:20.540
<b>Tell me what it is that you want.</b>

14:27.880 --> 14:29.180
<b>What's wrong?</b>

14:29.180 --> 14:31.300
<b>There's nothing you really want, is there?</b>

14:31.300 --> 14:32.420
<b>That's not it!</b>

14:39.680 --> 14:43.200
<b>I want to become friends with Gon...</b>

14:47.560 --> 14:50.880
<b>I'm sick of killing people...</b>

14:51.770 --> 14:53.440
<b>I want to become friends with Gon,</b>

14:54.720 --> 14:56.340
<b>and to live a normal life...</b>

14:57.200 --> 14:58.330
<b>That's impossible.</b>

14:59.950 --> 15:02.820
<b>You'll never be able to make friends.</b>

15:04.680 --> 15:09.910
<b>Your only concern when you meet someone 
is whether you should kill them.</b>

15:09.910 --> 15:12.220
<b>That's how you were trained.</b>

15:13.630 --> 15:16.130
<b>You just don't know how to classify Gon</b>

15:16.130 --> 15:18.360
<b>because he's too dazzling for your eyes.</b>

15:18.360 --> 15:20.660
<b>You don't actually want to 
become friends with him.</b>

15:21.740 --> 15:23.230
<b>You're wrong...</b>

15:23.560 --> 15:25.600
<b>If you stay with him,</b>

15:25.600 --> 15:28.360
<b>you'll end up wanting to kill him one day.</b>

15:28.690 --> 15:32.870
<b>You'll get the urge to see if 
you can kill him or not.</b>

15:33.260 --> 15:37.290
<b>Because you have the soul of a killer.</b>

15:42.710 --> 15:44.650
<b>As we mentioned before...</b>

15:44.650 --> 15:46.250
<b>Yeah, I know!</b>

15:46.250 --> 15:47.130
<b>Killua!</b>

15:47.640 --> 15:50.800
<b>I don't give a damn if he's your brother.</b>

15:50.800 --> 15:52.910
<b>He's a worthless piece of crap!</b>

15:52.910 --> 15:54.300
<b>Don't listen to him!</b>

15:54.300 --> 15:57.220
<b>Just beat the crap out of 
him like usual and win!</b>

15:57.700 --> 16:00.020
<b>You want to become friends with Gon?</b>

16:00.020 --> 16:01.190
<b>Are you daft?</b>

16:02.940 --> 16:05.810
<b>You already are friends!</b>

16:07.380 --> 16:10.120
<b>I'm sure that's how Gon feels!</b>

16:10.670 --> 16:11.700
<b>Really?</b>

16:12.190 --> 16:14.200
<b>Hell, yeah, idiot!</b>

16:15.020 --> 16:17.360
<b>Really... That's no good.</b>

16:17.360 --> 16:20.270
<b>He considers Kil a friend.</b>

16:21.380 --> 16:23.250
<b>Okay, I'll kill Gon.</b>

16:27.150 --> 16:29.460
<b>A killer doesn't need any friends.</b>

16:29.700 --> 16:31.570
<b>They'll only slow you down.</b>

16:34.150 --> 16:35.840
<b>Where is he?</b>

16:37.990 --> 16:39.960
<b>P-Please wait!</b>

16:39.960 --> 16:41.410
<b>The match is still...</b>

16:46.650 --> 16:47.650
<b>Where is he?</b>

16:47.650 --> 16:50.740
<b>The waiting room over there...</b>

16:51.630 --> 16:52.650
<b>Thank you.</b>

17:02.570 --> 17:04.200
<b>This won't do.</b>

17:04.200 --> 17:08.420
<b>I need a Hunter license to do my job...</b>

17:08.830 --> 17:11.190
<b>But if I kill them, I'll fail,</b>

17:11.190 --> 17:14.840
<b>and Kil will pass automatically.</b>

17:14.840 --> 17:19.190
<b>Oh, darn. The same thing 
will happen if I kill Gon.</b>

17:21.170 --> 17:22.060
<b>I know!</b>

17:22.590 --> 17:25.190
<b>I'll pass the exam before killing Gon.</b>

17:28.720 --> 17:30.480
<b>Bastard...</b>

17:31.080 --> 17:33.710
<b>If I wait until after passing the exam,</b>

17:33.710 --> 17:36.990
<b>I can kill everyone here and 
still keep my license, right?</b>

17:36.990 --> 17:40.620
<b>Yes, according to the rules.</b>

17:40.900 --> 17:42.490
<b>Did you hear that, Kil?</b>

17:44.590 --> 17:48.250
<b>You have to beat me if 
you want to save Gon.</b>

17:53.510 --> 17:56.290
<b>Will you fight me for your friend's sake?</b>

17:56.680 --> 17:58.280
<b>You can't do it.</b>

17:58.280 --> 18:01.190
<b>Because you're more worried</b>

18:01.190 --> 18:06.140
<b>about whether or not you can defeat me.</b>

18:08.670 --> 18:11.900
<b>And you already have your answer:</b>

18:12.640 --> 18:15.460
<b>"I'm not strong enough to beat my brother."</b>

18:16.680 --> 18:19.080
<b>"Never fight an enemy you can't beat."</b>

18:19.550 --> 18:22.790
<b>I drilled that into you...</b>

18:24.890 --> 18:26.410
<b>Don't move!</b>

18:26.740 --> 18:31.010
<b>If you move an inch, I'll assume 
that the fight has begun.</b>

18:31.010 --> 18:33.740
<b>And if our bodies make contact,</b>

18:33.740 --> 18:36.570
<b>that will also mean the fight has begun.</b>

18:37.130 --> 18:39.450
<b>There's only one way to stop me.</b>

18:40.170 --> 18:41.550
<b>You know what that is.</b>

18:43.400 --> 18:45.060
<b>But don't forget...</b>

18:45.500 --> 18:50.310
<b>If you don't fight me, your dear Gon will die.</b>

18:52.420 --> 18:53.970
<b>Take him out, Killua!</b>

18:54.370 --> 18:57.570
<b>We won't let him kill you or Gon!</b>

18:58.170 --> 19:00.450
<b>We'll stop him, whatever it takes!</b>

19:01.150 --> 19:02.930
<b>Let him have it!</b>

19:12.710 --> 19:13.840
<b>I surrender.</b>

19:14.760 --> 19:17.590
<b>I lose...</b>

19:23.650 --> 19:25.330
<b>Oh, that's good!</b>

19:26.040 --> 19:28.230
<b>Then the battle's over.</b>

19:30.200 --> 19:31.520
<b>I lied, Kil.</b>

19:31.520 --> 19:33.410
<b>I was lying about killing Gon.</b>

19:33.870 --> 19:36.870
<b>That was just a little test.</b>

19:36.870 --> 19:38.990
<b>But now I have my answer.</b>

19:40.960 --> 19:43.980
<b>You don't have the right to make friends.</b>

19:44.570 --> 19:45.990
<b>Nor do you need friends.</b>

19:47.000 --> 19:53.260
<b>You should just listen to Dad and me, 
and do your job as you always have.</b>

19:53.960 --> 19:55.710
<b>When the time comes,</b>

19:55.710 --> 19:58.010
<b>I'll tell you to take the Hunter Exam.</b>

19:58.680 --> 20:00.230
<b>You don't need a license yet.</b>

20:00.920 --> 20:03.560
<b>After that, he was reduced 
to a shell of himself.</b>

20:04.850 --> 20:07.930
<b>Leorio and Kurapika tried to help,</b>

20:07.930 --> 20:10.020
<b>but he wouldn't respond.</b>

20:10.770 --> 20:14.020
<b>The sixth match was between 
Leorio and Bodoro.</b>

20:14.640 --> 20:18.320
<b>Bodoro had recovered, 
but when the match began...</b>

20:18.790 --> 20:19.650
<b>Begin!</b>

20:45.420 --> 20:47.140
<b>It was over in a second.</b>

20:47.470 --> 20:50.770
<b>Killua had killed Bodoro.</b>

20:51.310 --> 20:55.150
<b>The committee disqualified him.</b>

20:56.420 --> 20:57.230
<b>Gon-kun!</b>

20:57.550 --> 20:59.050
<b>Where is everyone?</b>

20:59.600 --> 21:02.240
<b>You need more rest, Gon-kun...</b>

21:26.270 --> 21:27.510
<b>Gon.</b>

21:39.340 --> 21:41.150
<b>Apologize to Killua!</b>

21:44.160 --> 21:46.160
<b>Gon was angry.</b>

21:46.650 --> 21:49.160
<b>Illumi had trampled on</b>

21:49.160 --> 21:53.660
<b>his brother's desire to become 
friends with Gon,</b>

21:53.660 --> 21:56.170
<b>abandoning Killua to despair.</b>

21:56.570 --> 21:58.260
<b>And Gon was angry.</b>

23:28.160 --> 23:30.590
<b>Next time: Some x Brother x Trouble!</b>

23:30.590 --> 23:32.640
<b>Do Leorio and I look alike?</b>

23:32.640 --> 23:33.990
<b>Get out of here...</b>
