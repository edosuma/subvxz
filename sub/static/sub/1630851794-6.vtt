11:36.029 --> 11:38.263
That should give us
a good radius to be
able to move

11:38.265 --> 11:39.330
and follow the gold.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.199
That looks like
it's a pretty good space.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.500
<i>  This has got to work.</i>

11:42.502 --> 11:44.669
I'm running out of time,
and I need five or six

11:44.671 --> 11:47.238
more ounces to keep
this operation going.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.207
<i>  We can move over to tomcod,</i>

11:49.209 --> 11:52.444
but it'll eat up a lot of time
that I don't have,

11:52.446 --> 11:54.612
and we can still end up
with no gold.

11:54.614 --> 11:55.814
[machinery whirring]

11:55.816 --> 11:57.515
-wow.
-Nice.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.250
That was easy.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.852
Let's see
how thick this ice is.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.396
Man,
that's deep ice.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.631
[machinery whirring]

12:13.633 --> 12:14.866
goodness gracious.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.000
Wow.

12:16.002 --> 12:17.102
Dude, what the hell?

12:17.104 --> 12:18.970
Oh, my god.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.905
[indistinct]

12:28.148 --> 12:30.381
[zeke] damn.
Ice is at least this deep,

12:30.383 --> 12:31.549
which is pretty deep,

12:31.551 --> 12:33.351
'cause I'm like
six feet tall,

12:33.353 --> 12:34.853
it's a whole person deep.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.821
A short dude.

12:36.823 --> 12:38.990
[man] there's still like
a sheet of bottom ice there.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.925
[zeke] yeah, there's
something else
going on down there.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.427
Yeah, yeah,
we're not actually through.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.828
[man] no, we're not.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.232
If we can't get
a hole made in this ice,

12:47.234 --> 12:49.000
we'll have to make
a ice hole elsewhere,

12:49.002 --> 12:50.802
where the ice is not as thick.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.771
I'm just processing
this information

12:52.773 --> 12:55.206
and trying to think of a plan.

12:55.208 --> 12:57.442
<i>  I just can't catch</i>
<i>  a break right now.</i>

12:57.444 --> 13:00.478
Seven feet of ice is just
too thick to drill through.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.147
This is just
not gonna work.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.816
Once again, we're gonna
have to reassess

13:04.818 --> 13:07.318
and figure out
a new plan of attack.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.820
Dude, if we can't get
through the ice,

13:08.822 --> 13:10.121
we can't get through the ice.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.590
<i>  What the hell?</i>

13:17.798 --> 13:18.997
<i> [narrator] eight miles west...</i>

13:22.602 --> 13:25.236
Your umbilical line
is the biggest problem

13:25.238 --> 13:26.738
you have underneath the water,

13:26.740 --> 13:28.740
because that [bleep]
if it gets tangled up,

13:28.742 --> 13:30.708
it will kill you.

[man] there's also
a current underneath

13:36.082 --> 13:38.383
this ice
that will wash you away.

13:38.385 --> 13:41.619
So, you know, don't worry,
you're gonna be just fine.

13:41.621 --> 13:44.522
So we're way behind
where we need to be right now.

13:44.524 --> 13:48.126
I owe a boatload of money,
and we only have seven ounces.

13:48.128 --> 13:49.627
<i>  We need to catch up fast,</i>

13:49.629 --> 13:52.897
but I have an itty bitty
little life-changing situation

13:52.899 --> 13:54.933
coming in right now.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.138
<i>  We've got</i>

14:00.140 --> 14:03.441
That means teaching james,
who has never dove for gold,

14:03.443 --> 14:05.510
has never seen gold underneath
the water,

14:05.512 --> 14:07.545
and doesn't know
what the [bleep] he's doing.

14:07.547 --> 14:09.013
[brad] taking bets
right now on james.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.248
I have faith in him,
what do you...

14:10.250 --> 14:11.683
How long do you think
he's gonna last?

14:11.685 --> 14:13.084
[andy] I want less than 15.
[indistinct]

14:13.086 --> 14:17.422
[kris] put in 20 bucks on
less than 10 minutes for me.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.290
[man] kris is saying
you're gonna last
less than ten.

14:19.292 --> 14:20.458
Andy says
you're gonna last 15,

14:20.460 --> 14:22.227
but I'd say you're gonna
last 20 minutes at least.

14:22.229 --> 14:26.030
[kris] I'm just saying
15 minutes out of the water,
dude, hey.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.532
We're gonna see
if he can do it.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.933
We all have faith in him.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.703
We're gonna see.

14:31.705 --> 14:34.672
[kris] jim's ready to go
underneath the water.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.841
[man]
if you see my mom, say hi.

14:36.843 --> 14:38.643
If you see your mom,
you're not gonna have to.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.645
[laughing]

14:44.050 --> 14:46.517
first dive ever,
and just so happens,

14:46.519 --> 14:49.087
it's gonna be
under the ice,

14:49.089 --> 14:50.588
probably
not the smartest thing

14:50.590 --> 14:54.259
and then diving with people
that may not dive properly,

14:54.261 --> 14:56.628
but what could go wrong?

14:56.630 --> 14:59.530
Come on down,
you're the next contestant.

15:00.867 --> 15:03.534
The timer is not starting
until he touches

15:03.536 --> 15:05.403
the bottom
of the [bleep] ground,

15:05.405 --> 15:07.605
because anybody can stay
on the ladder.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.743
Mining underneath
the ice is brutal.

15:11.745 --> 15:14.979
I need james to kill it,
but I've got to be realistic.

15:14.981 --> 15:19.450
There's always
a learning curve
and it's steep, very steep.

15:19.452 --> 15:20.885
You can do it.

15:20.887 --> 15:23.187
You can do it, james.

15:23.189 --> 15:25.223
[james speaking]

15:30.363 --> 15:32.030
wow! This is awesome.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.198
Yeah,
I'm looking right at you,

15:34.200 --> 15:35.833
that's not awesome.
Get down there.

15:37.404 --> 15:38.670
He's two feet down,

15:38.705 --> 15:41.372
you know, it's gonna take
half-an-hour
just to start the timer.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.276
<i>  Hey, you can swim, right?</i>

15:45.278 --> 15:46.711
[james] uh, yeah.

15:46.713 --> 15:47.879
[kris]
<i>  get your ass down there.</i>

15:47.881 --> 15:49.681
<i>  We're waiting</i>
<i>  to start the time on you.</i>

15:51.551 --> 15:53.151
[james] dude, this is cold.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.552
<i> [kris] that's great.</i>

15:54.554 --> 15:57.388
<i>  Now, pull your ass</i>
<i>  down to the bottom</i>
<i>  and make my money.</i>

16:01.428 --> 16:02.727
[james] I'm on the bottom.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.964
<i> [kris] okay.</i>
<i>  Timer started, tell me</i>

16:05.966 --> 16:09.033
<i>  when you get to the nozzle</i>
<i>  and you want to tie it all up</i>

16:09.035 --> 16:11.235
<i>  so you can actually</i>
<i>  start working.</i>

16:11.237 --> 16:13.171
[james] dude, this is a trip.

16:15.175 --> 16:18.676
Hey, is water supposed to come
at the bottom of my mask?

16:21.047 --> 16:24.215
There's no water supposed
to come in your mask?

16:24.217 --> 16:27.952
[james] oh. Uh, I got
salt water in my mouth.

16:27.954 --> 16:30.154
[kris]
<i>  drink it and keep going.</i>

16:30.156 --> 16:32.724
[james] all right.
Okay.

16:32.726 --> 16:34.092
Come up.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.694
We'll drain the mask
and figure it out.
Guess who won.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.162
<i> [james] ah!</i>

16:38.164 --> 16:40.965
That [bleep] counts,
he made it to the floor

16:40.967 --> 16:42.667
and he had to come back up.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.839
Hey, you know what, [bleep]
that, stay on the bottom

16:47.841 --> 16:49.907
for another 14 minutes
until I win.

16:49.909 --> 16:51.442
[james laughs]

16:54.114 --> 16:56.581
[james]
can somebody fix the mask?

16:56.583 --> 16:58.049
I know what the problem is,

16:58.051 --> 16:59.717
the mask is too tight.

16:59.719 --> 17:02.720
At least you're not scared
when you're down there.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.889
The learning curve
is always super steep.

17:04.891 --> 17:07.558
But for james, it's the size
of mount everest.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.927
<i>  But hey, where there's risk,</i>
<i>  there's a reward,</i>

17:09.929 --> 17:13.064
and james is gonna make
or break my season.

17:13.066 --> 17:14.198
Comfortable?

17:15.602 --> 17:17.635
Okay, go underneath the water,
try it.

17:23.777 --> 17:25.510
[james speaking]

17:26.980 --> 17:28.946
[brad] all right. Tell me
when you're at the bottom.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.786
[james speaking]

17:38.792 --> 17:40.358
dude, we all know
what the bottom looks like.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.392
Just get to work.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.394
[james speaking]

17:46.332 --> 17:48.599
<i> [brad] I didn't mean walk like</i>
<i>  a grandma, dude.</i>

17:51.337 --> 17:54.072
[james speaking]

17:55.942 --> 17:57.241
grab the nozzle

17:57.243 --> 18:00.611
and start
sucking the bottom up
and get to the clay.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.385
And don't let
a lot of big rocks go up
the nozzle, okay?

18:07.387 --> 18:08.686
[james speaking]

18:12.058 --> 18:13.191
wow!

18:15.562 --> 18:17.228
Are you
vacuuming up the bottom?

18:17.230 --> 18:19.397
<i> [james] yeah.</i>
<i>  I'm vacuuming.</i>

18:22.769 --> 18:26.204
[james speaking]

18:28.241 --> 18:30.908
<i>  oh, dude,</i>
<i>  I'm gonna blow</i>
<i>  past 15 minutes.</i>

18:42.655 --> 18:45.423
Either we find
a thin spot around here,

18:45.425 --> 18:46.757
where we can get
through the ice

18:46.759 --> 18:50.094
or we just like pack up
and, like, move down
to tomcod.

18:50.096 --> 18:52.530
But like, there is gold here.

18:52.532 --> 18:55.299
So like, that's why I am
careful with making
that decision

18:55.301 --> 18:56.634
because it's gonna be
a big,

18:56.636 --> 18:58.970
huge effort moving.

<i>  a desperate situation</i>
<i>  even more desperate.</i>

19:08.715 --> 19:09.981
<i> [zeke] well,</i>
<i>  I just want to check</i>

19:10.049 --> 19:13.918

to this seven-foot thick ice.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.660
Can't even get
through this ice.

19:22.662 --> 19:26.063
I haven't found nearly
enough gold so far to keep
this operation running.

<i>  If we can't find</i>
<i>  any thinner ice,</i>

19:28.034 --> 19:30.735
then I think
that just might be it
for me this season.

19:32.906 --> 19:34.505
Did it go all the way down?

19:34.507 --> 19:36.407
Yeah.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.776
This is gonna give me
a radius,

19:38.778 --> 19:41.112
you know, of another
30, 40 feet around this way.

19:41.114 --> 19:43.381
But it's...
You know, it's not,

19:43.383 --> 19:47.051
it's not as much
new territory as I would like.

19:47.053 --> 19:48.953
But I know
there's some gold here

on top of each other.

it goes all the way
to the bottom.

Oh, yeah,
looks like this is right

dredging before, I think.

it's spooky.

20:50.950 --> 20:54.252
Got giant ice cones that
are just, like, terrifying.

20:54.254 --> 20:56.187
Yeah, I don't really
want to go under there.

20:56.189 --> 20:57.888
There's plenty of gold
everywhere else.

what we can here
and the [bleep] out.

[music]

21:21.581 --> 21:23.914
okay,
now that you're down there,
you're comfortable,

21:23.916 --> 21:27.051
make sure you have an exit
in case everything goes bad,

21:27.053 --> 21:28.352
which it does sometimes.

a third diver
for the rest of the season.

Make sure you get
all the black sand,

22:13.866 --> 22:16.300
even if you don't see
gold in the black sand,

22:16.302 --> 22:17.635
there's gold in it.

22:18.805 --> 22:20.938
[james speaking]

22:39.125 --> 22:40.791
<i> [kris] that's great.</i>
<i>  Good job.</i>

22:41.828 --> 22:43.627
I told you
he was gonna work out.

22:43.629 --> 22:45.463
You know,
what makes the best miner,

22:45.465 --> 22:48.532
when you're too stupid
to [bleep] know
you're in trouble.

22:48.534 --> 22:50.668
Right now, he's doing it,
he's making gold.

22:50.670 --> 22:53.270
He doesn't know
about all the problems
that could happen.

22:53.272 --> 22:54.572
And it's beautiful.

22:54.574 --> 22:56.774
He doesn't need to know.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.409
<i> [man] welcome to the reaper.</i>

23:01.614 --> 23:04.648
[music]

23:09.789 --> 23:11.589
[shawn] time to get
the little dozer going.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.725
[narrator]
<i>  with his season on the line,</i>

23:14.727 --> 23:18.396
shawn pomrenke
is bringing out the big guns.

23:18.398 --> 23:20.898
[shawn]
time to move some snow.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.533
Priority number one,

23:22.535 --> 23:25.936
I need to get as much snow off
this site as I possibly can.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.671
<i>  It's weighing down</i>
<i>  the ice so much.</i>

23:27.673 --> 23:31.742
<i>  It's bursting through</i>
<i>  all the holes</i>
<i>  and any cracks in the ice.</i>

23:31.744 --> 23:35.679
<i>  Of course,</i>
<i>  putting this much pressure</i>
<i>  on weak ice is risky,</i>

23:35.681 --> 23:38.416
but with only a few weeks left
in the season,

23:38.418 --> 23:40.284
it's a chance I have to take.

23:46.325 --> 23:48.325
It's gonna take
a whole lot of work.

23:48.327 --> 23:50.528
[joe] definitely a lot easier
than shoveling.

23:52.331 --> 23:53.664
Ooh, yeah!

23:53.666 --> 23:55.366
<i> [shawn] obviously,</i>
<i>  I can't plow</i>

23:55.368 --> 23:57.968
<i>  all the snow off the entire</i>
<i>  bering sea.</i>

23:57.970 --> 24:00.371
Hopefully, I can clear off
a big enough area

24:00.373 --> 24:05.476
that the ice will float up
and we won't be working in
five feet of overflow

24:05.478 --> 24:07.344
<i> and we can get back to diving.</i>

24:13.152 --> 24:15.219
[man] we got
a little bit of overflow.

24:17.023 --> 24:18.989
[shawn] well,
that's not working out well.

24:20.193 --> 24:23.160
<i>  The ocean is coming up</i>
<i>  on top of the ice.</i>

24:23.162 --> 24:25.463
There's too much weight
on the ice.

24:26.666 --> 24:28.132
[man] you see that?

24:30.736 --> 24:33.871
[shawn]
<i>  you got a foot of water</i>
<i>  on top of the ice.</i>

24:33.873 --> 24:36.240
Get the dozer
stuck in that,

24:36.242 --> 24:39.710
it'll be
the end of that dozer.

24:39.712 --> 24:42.780
<i>  I can't be anywhere</i>
<i>  near of these holes.</i>

24:42.782 --> 24:44.582
<i>  I'm not gonna lie.</i>

24:44.584 --> 24:45.983
<i>  It's pretty grim.</i>

24:45.985 --> 24:47.518
<i>  Plan's not working at all.</i>

24:47.520 --> 24:50.120
But we're gonna go
try a new spot,

24:50.122 --> 24:51.589
where we haven't drilled.

24:51.591 --> 24:53.190
<i>  See if it works there.</i>

24:53.192 --> 24:54.825
<i>  Hopefully,</i>
<i>  I can get enough weight off</i>

24:54.827 --> 24:56.393
<i>  that area</i>
<i>  to stop the flooding.</i>

24:56.395 --> 24:59.530
If not, it's game over.

24:59.532 --> 25:02.700
<i> [shawn] we got</i>
<i>  a lot of weight in this area</i>
<i>  with all the shacks,</i>

25:02.702 --> 25:05.002
we're gonna go
over a little further,

25:06.405 --> 25:07.972
try to clear
our area,

25:07.974 --> 25:09.106
see what it does.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.742
Hopefully, I can get
this ice to come up.

25:11.744 --> 25:15.145
If it doesn't, then that's
the end of this ice season.

25:16.682 --> 25:19.383
[engine revving]

25:24.056 --> 25:25.723
[shawn]
we're gonna have to clear
a big area.

25:25.725 --> 25:26.991
There's no doubt.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.496
<i>  Look, there's so much snow.</i>

25:34.233 --> 25:37.201
[music]

25:42.742 --> 25:44.141
[man] I don't know,
what do you reckon?

25:44.143 --> 25:46.343
[shawn] drill a hole
and see what happens.

25:46.345 --> 25:49.146
[machinery whirring]

25:52.151 --> 25:53.984
[man speaking]

26:06.065 --> 26:07.231
[shawn] yeah.

26:08.734 --> 26:09.967
Our plan worked.

26:09.969 --> 26:12.703
We got all the weight
of the snow off the ice.

26:12.705 --> 26:14.838
Ice raised up.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.440
We're good.

26:16.442 --> 26:18.008
Thank god it worked.

26:18.010 --> 26:20.678
Now, let's get back to mining
and get some gold.

26:20.680 --> 26:24.415
I think, get
out here tomorrow morning
and get all the stuff pulled,

26:24.417 --> 26:28.619
get it back underwater and get
to mining and dredging.

26:28.621 --> 26:31.055
I love it when a plan
comes together.

26:33.459 --> 26:36.060

all the time?

26:52.378 --> 26:53.744
<i> [gary] why is that?</i>

26:55.982 --> 26:57.381
[man] well, if you had
that many crabs

26:57.383 --> 26:59.316
on your bottom,
you'd roar too.

26:59.318 --> 27:01.952
[gary laughing]

27:01.954 --> 27:04.555
[gary] all right.

27:04.557 --> 27:08.726

27:17.169 --> 27:21.672
Okay, well,
you've got 5 hours
and 20 minutes,

27:21.674 --> 27:23.507
<i>  then it's time to come up.</i>

27:23.509 --> 27:25.843
All right.

Throw a little gold out there

27:27.213 --> 27:30.781
in front of your nose
and I'll know it's time
to get you up.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.349
[gary] I mean,
I don't know what it is.

27:32.351 --> 27:34.051
I kind of like it down here.

[vernon] good. Iron man.
Or a gold man I should say.

27:38.524 --> 27:41.325
We're getting
closer and closer
to that open lead.

<i>  up on that thin ice</i>

27:43.729 --> 27:45.663
<i>  and our divers underneath it,</i>

27:45.665 --> 27:47.898
<i>  we've got to be</i>

<i>  So we're gonna take</i>
<i>  a break,</i>

27:49.568 --> 27:53.871

and make sure the gold
is as good as we think it is.

Holy [bleep].
Look at all that.
[bleep] yeah.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.577

28:00.579 --> 28:01.679
[man] oh, yeah.

28:01.681 --> 28:03.614
Got a lot of gold
in there.

28:03.616 --> 28:06.316
Good gold.
Love it.

28:06.318 --> 28:08.585
All I got to say is booyah.

28:08.587 --> 28:10.754
<i>  Our hot streak</i>
<i>  just keeps going.</i>

28:10.756 --> 28:13.424

<i>  as long as the ice holds up</i>
<i>  and the guys are willing,</i>

28:16.495 --> 28:19.630
but we'll need to
keep our eyes and ears
open at all times.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.733
The hole is looking
really good.

28:22.735 --> 28:26.003
We'll send gary down
to finish up the day

28:26.005 --> 28:28.806
and put some more gold
in the box.

28:28.808 --> 28:30.207
All right, gary.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.675
Get after it, buddy.

28:41.787 --> 28:45.756

my way back towards the hole.

28:45.758 --> 28:47.057
All right.

Oh, this looks like
some good stuff.

you were gonna do.

31:26.185 --> 31:27.451
[james]
[bleep] loads of water.

31:31.423 --> 31:33.023
I didn't want to stop.

31:33.025 --> 31:35.292
Honestly, I thought james
was gonna get down there,

31:35.294 --> 31:36.560
cause nothing but trouble.

31:36.562 --> 31:39.129

<i>  This is way better than</i>
<i>  I hoped for.</i>

31:41.000 --> 31:44.268

Hey, buddy,
you did a good job.

31:45.704 --> 31:48.372

32:01.954 --> 32:04.121
but nothing like
super awesome yet.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.622
Gotcha.

32:05.624 --> 32:09.192
We put a lot of work
into digging this hole
and getting set up on it.

32:09.194 --> 32:11.194
So there's a lot riding
on there

32:11.196 --> 32:15.098
being a good amount of gold
here.

32:15.100 --> 32:18.702
<i> [narrator] looking to tap</i>

[man] zeke, you've been
down there a couple hours.

32:27.012 --> 32:28.278
Does it looked like
it's worth staying?

32:30.382 --> 32:35.185
[zeke] well, it's not looking
super hot out here.

32:36.522 --> 32:37.955
There's a lot of sand
around here,

32:37.957 --> 32:40.490
and I was just dredging up
a bunch of sand.

32:40.492 --> 32:42.693
What's the ice
look like above you?

32:43.896 --> 32:47.130
All I see above me
is like all these ice blocks

32:47.132 --> 32:48.832
that are on
top of other ice blocks.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.135
It's pretty sketch up there,
I don't like it.

32:52.137 --> 32:54.838
I don't like thinking about
that on me, you know.

32:57.543 --> 33:01.211
And I haven't seen
a single little puddle
of gold that I like.

33:04.950 --> 33:06.883
I think
this hole is just a dud.

33:09.121 --> 33:11.021
I think that it's a clear sign

33:11.023 --> 33:12.823
that it's time
to move out of here.

33:15.427 --> 33:17.127
Yeah,
I'm just gonna head on up.

I stopped dredging last
time, that was like

33:33.112 --> 33:35.479
the end of there being
really anything at all.

33:39.184 --> 33:42.219
This is a huge disappointment.

33:42.221 --> 33:43.954
It's already
the back half of the season,

33:43.956 --> 33:46.256
we're gonna have to move
this entire operation

33:46.258 --> 33:48.692
<i>  and set it up on a new claim.</i>

33:48.694 --> 33:52.262

<i>  show up at tomcod</i>
<i>  and start diving.</i>

33:52.264 --> 33:55.699
First,
I'm gonna have to make
a deal with pomrenke.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.267
It's not a cool ice hole.

33:57.269 --> 34:00.537

so it's time to bail.

we're gonna be talking
about a 6-inch operation

and an 8-inch operation.

Hold on, calm down.

Get your head
out of the gutter.

<i>  I didn't even bring my pants</i>
<i>  or nothing.</i>

34:23.228 --> 34:25.896
In mining, size does matter,

34:25.898 --> 34:28.265
maybe not in everything
in life.

34:28.267 --> 34:31.001
But whoever says
that's kind of [bleep] too.

34:31.003 --> 34:33.770
<i>  The 6-inch is lighter,</i>
<i>  easier to handle.</i>

34:33.772 --> 34:38.408
6-inch operation is also
probably under half the price.

34:38.410 --> 34:39.876
But what do you really
want to do?

34:39.878 --> 34:42.813
You want to get down there
and get as much gold
as you can.

34:42.815 --> 34:45.482
And that's what
an 8-inch operation
will get you.

34:46.552 --> 34:49.152
[man] oh, yeah. Yeah!

34:49.154 --> 34:51.488
6-inch nozzle.
8-inch nozzle.

34:51.490 --> 34:53.256
Two inches count.

34:53.258 --> 34:55.859
With that extra two inches
that you have,

34:55.861 --> 34:58.095
<i>  you're not gonna have</i>
<i>  to move as many rocks.</i>

34:58.097 --> 34:59.863
You know,
you're not going
to have to get down there

34:59.865 --> 35:02.432
and physically work
all [bleep] day long.

35:02.434 --> 35:03.867
Once you've been
with an eight,

35:03.869 --> 35:06.103
it's extremely hard
to go back to a six

35:06.105 --> 35:08.738
and everybody out there will
probably agree with me.

35:08.740 --> 35:10.140
Thank you very much
for watching

35:10.142 --> 35:13.343
another edition of secret...
What the [bleep] am I doing?

35:13.345 --> 35:14.911
Thank you very much
for watching

35:14.913 --> 35:18.582
another episode
of kris kelly's secret guide
to successful mining.

35:22.454 --> 35:25.789
[music]

35:31.029 --> 35:33.296
[brad] that spot we're
on now is the motherlode.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.031
[kris] that's a lot of gold.

35:35.067 --> 35:40.036
<i> [narrator] kris' plan</i>
<i>  for the back half of winter</i>
<i>  may already be bearing fruit.</i>

35:40.038 --> 35:42.806
James is working all right,
you know, his first dive.
[indistinct].

35:42.808 --> 35:43.907
Yeah.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.509
He did better than
any other diver

35:45.511 --> 35:47.744
we've had down there,
and you got to admit
he's a pretty good diver.

35:47.746 --> 35:49.579
Let's not start high-fiving
each other yet.

35:49.581 --> 35:52.048
For the reaper to hit
25 ounces this season,

35:52.050 --> 35:55.018
I need james
to be a reliable diver.

35:55.020 --> 35:57.020
He actually did pretty good
for his first time.

35:57.022 --> 35:59.890
Now, we'll weigh it out
and the proof will be
in the pudding.

35:59.892 --> 36:01.658
Let's weigh this up.
Let's see where we're at.

36:01.660 --> 36:02.993
Okay.

36:04.696 --> 36:07.731
That's one ounce, two ounces,
two and a half, three,

36:09.334 --> 36:10.367
four,

36:12.137 --> 36:13.303
five,

36:15.140 --> 36:16.540
six ounces.

36:18.243 --> 36:20.577
[kris] whoa, 6.4 ounces.

36:20.579 --> 36:21.845
All right.

36:21.847 --> 36:22.979
That's really good money.

36:22.981 --> 36:24.381
That is awesome money.

36:24.383 --> 36:27.918
<i> [narrator] 6.4 ounces</i>
<i>  is worth over $12,000.</i>

36:27.920 --> 36:30.554
<i>  A successful haul</i>
<i>  for any diver,</i>

36:30.556 --> 36:33.023
<i>  let alone a first timer.</i>

36:33.025 --> 36:34.991
-Hey, cap that
[bleep] up. Let's go.
-Okay.

36:34.993 --> 36:36.126
Everything's good.

36:36.128 --> 36:37.460
[man]
mission successful so far,

36:37.462 --> 36:39.196
now that I move
us to the real goal.

36:39.198 --> 36:40.664
<i>  Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

36:40.666 --> 36:42.032
<i>  The sun shines</i>
<i>  on a dog's ass some days.</i>

36:42.034 --> 36:43.900
<i> [brad] well, it always shines</i>
<i>  on my ass. Let's go.</i>

36:46.038 --> 36:48.738
[music]

36:54.346 --> 36:56.313
<i> [zeke] we got to figure out</i>
<i>  how to make this work.</i>

36:57.482 --> 36:58.982
[indistinct]

36:58.984 --> 37:02.285
<i> [narrator] zeke's looking</i>
<i>  to tomcod to pick up</i>
<i>  a sagging season.</i>

37:02.287 --> 37:04.454
<i>  And that means making a deal.</i>

37:04.456 --> 37:05.522
[zeke] hey, shawn.

37:05.524 --> 37:06.590
[shawn] what's up, zeke?

37:06.592 --> 37:08.725
<i> [narrator] with mr. Gold.</i>

37:08.727 --> 37:10.994
[zeke]
we got our ice operation
pretty much running.

37:10.996 --> 37:12.162
Yeah.

37:12.164 --> 37:15.832
But where we are
by the causeway,

37:15.834 --> 37:17.867
kind of feel like
pretty well picked over.

37:17.869 --> 37:19.369
Yeah, well, you know,

37:19.371 --> 37:21.938
that area is close to the...
Close to the port,

37:21.940 --> 37:25.008
so it gets hammered
because it's easy.

37:25.010 --> 37:27.444
I was wondering
if you still had any spots
open on tomcod

37:27.446 --> 37:28.678
we could go out and check out.

37:30.983 --> 37:32.515
[shawn] we've got
some spots out there for you.

37:32.517 --> 37:34.251
[zeke] nice.

37:34.253 --> 37:37.053
Moving the entire operation
this late in the game

37:37.055 --> 37:39.189
could just be a disaster
for me.

37:39.191 --> 37:40.724
<i>  But I'm desperate.</i>

37:40.726 --> 37:42.959
If I can't find enough gold
to keep going,

37:42.961 --> 37:44.961
my mining season is over.

37:44.963 --> 37:46.229
Cool.

37:46.231 --> 37:48.164
We'll probably need to get
some paperwork
together for you.

37:48.166 --> 37:49.332
[shawn] yeah.

37:49.334 --> 37:50.567
And get all that straight.

37:50.569 --> 37:52.002
But as soon as
we get that straight,

37:52.004 --> 37:53.436
I'm ready to go out there.

37:53.438 --> 37:54.871
What about royalty?

37:58.043 --> 37:59.442
What are you thinking?

38:00.779 --> 38:01.945
I'd like 20.

38:03.115 --> 38:04.447
Fifteen would be better.

38:06.585 --> 38:08.752
It's up to you.

38:08.754 --> 38:10.620
[shawn] I mean, I like it,

38:10.622 --> 38:12.722
and I know
how hard ice mining is,

38:12.724 --> 38:15.992
so I'll give you a
15% royalty.

38:15.994 --> 38:18.328
-[zeke] right on.
I appreciate it.
-Yeah, no problem.

38:18.330 --> 38:21.631
I could have probably
squeeze zeke
for a little bit more.

38:21.633 --> 38:24.200
It's late in the season
and he's getting desperate,

38:24.202 --> 38:25.468
but zeke's a good dude.

38:25.470 --> 38:27.037
I know
he's gonna bust his ass.

38:27.039 --> 38:28.538
And the more gold he gets,

38:28.540 --> 38:30.040
it's better for both of us.

38:30.042 --> 38:31.408
Right on.
We'll see you out there.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.443
-[shawn] okay. Yeah.
-We'll see you on the ice.

38:33.445 --> 38:34.878
-Thanks, shawn.
-Yep. We'll see you.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.179
[zeke] see ya.

38:40.452 --> 38:43.420
[music]

38:46.325 --> 38:47.490
[gary] this is looking good.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.159
Packing the box full.

38:50.429 --> 38:52.696
[vernon] that's some nice,
clean gold right there.

38:52.698 --> 38:55.665
[narrator]
<i>  after pushing closer</i>
<i>  to the open water lead,</i>

38:55.667 --> 39:01.237
<i>  the question is will it lead</i>
<i>  vernon's team to make a gold?</i>

39:01.239 --> 39:03.239
[vernon] weigh it up, gary,
let's see what we got there.

39:03.241 --> 39:04.607
[gary] all right.
Here we go.

39:07.479 --> 39:14.317
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

39:20.125 --> 39:24.627
twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen,

39:24.629 --> 39:26.596
sixteen, seventeen.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.935
18.04.

39:31.937 --> 39:36.973
<i> [narrator] 18.04 ounces</i>
<i>  is worth over $34,000.</i>

39:36.975 --> 39:40.210
<i> Proof that if they can outlast</i>
<i>  the thinning ice,</i>

39:40.212 --> 39:43.546
<i>  this spot may lead</i>
<i>  vernon straight to the top.</i>

39:43.548 --> 39:46.750
I'm telling you, buying
56 was the best move

39:46.752 --> 39:48.852
I've ever made in my life.

39:48.854 --> 39:49.953
[gary] yeah.

39:49.955 --> 39:51.054
I mean, that's gonna be

39:51.056 --> 39:53.590
my retirement program
right out there on 56.

39:53.592 --> 39:55.992
More money,
more money, more money.

39:55.994 --> 39:58.561
This claim just keeps
on delivering,

39:58.563 --> 40:01.331
<i>  and this new spot might be</i>
<i>  the richest of all.</i>

40:01.333 --> 40:04.267
<i>  I'm hoping the lead</i>
<i>  doesn't expand any further.</i>

40:04.269 --> 40:06.803
<i>  Otherwise,</i>
<i>  both our underwater atm</i>

40:06.805 --> 40:09.706
and our safety
will be at risk.

40:09.708 --> 40:12.776
We might have to call
this el primo.

40:12.778 --> 40:14.144
I mean, I'm liking super gold,

40:14.146 --> 40:18.548
but this is
the cream of the crop
right here.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.550
All right, gary,
let's get this tucked away

40:20.552 --> 40:22.619
and get the hell
on back out there.

40:26.024 --> 40:31.828
<i> [narrator] vernon</i>

<i>  mr. Gold stalls out.</i>

<i> [kris] the baby could come</i>
<i>  pretty much any time</i>
<i>  right now,</i>

40:38.470 --> 40:40.103
so we need to get as much
gold as we can today.

40:40.105 --> 40:44.207
