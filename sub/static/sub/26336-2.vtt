We need a cop who doesn't
think like a cop,

00:05.353 --> 00:07.181
who isn't afraid to break
the rules a little bit.

00:07.224 --> 00:09.705
Or break somebody's nose.Well, so, you
heard about that?

00:09.748 --> 00:11.489
Yeah, we heard that your
training officer deserved it.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.839
TANI:
I found something.

00:13.883 --> 00:15.667
The gun matches a slug
found in Noriko.

00:15.711 --> 00:17.843
As far as I'm concerned, prison
would be letting her off easy.

00:17.887 --> 00:18.844
She deserves worse.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.368
A lot worse.

00:20.411 --> 00:23.284
Adam just saved
my brother's life.

00:23.327 --> 00:24.546
I'm supposed to repay him
by turning him in?

00:24.589 --> 00:25.895
If Adam killed his sister,

00:25.938 --> 00:27.157
you need to do
he right thing.

00:27.201 --> 00:29.855
Are you telling me there's
a mole inside the CIA?

00:29.899 --> 00:32.075
Who is that?DANNY: It's Agent Greer.

Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain.

00:47.090 --> 00:49.614
We're getting ready to make
our final descent into Honolulu

00:49.658 --> 00:52.748
and should be on the ground
in roughly ten minutes.

00:52.791 --> 00:54.576
So if anyone needs to use
the restroom before we land,

00:54.619 --> 00:55.881
now would be the time.

your tray tables stowed

01:24.084 --> 01:26.303

to have you return to...

03:00.092 --> 03:02.399
What'd you do?

03:02.443 --> 03:04.271
What did Ido?
Tell you what happened.What'd you do?

03:04.314 --> 03:06.447
Your stupid dog went digging

03:06.490 --> 03:07.752
in your backyard.[sighs]

03:07.796 --> 03:09.058
Junior came out here
this morning, you got money

03:09.101 --> 03:10.538
flying around
like we're at a-a strip club.

03:10.581 --> 03:11.887
Okay?

03:11.930 --> 03:13.454
How much did we lose?I don't know

03:13.497 --> 03:15.325
how much we lost.
We're gonna have to do a count.

03:15.369 --> 03:16.587
You understand that?
We're gonna do a count,

03:16.631 --> 03:18.459
and if that dog ate
any of the money,

03:18.502 --> 03:20.461
you're gonna be in charge
of finding out

03:20.504 --> 03:22.332
if whatever he ate comes out,
you know what I mean?

03:22.376 --> 03:24.465
Hey, I think, uh,
Eddie feels pretty bad

03:24.508 --> 03:25.901
about what he did, if
that's any consolation.

03:25.944 --> 03:27.685
[Eddie whines]

03:27.729 --> 03:30.514
No. It's not. Thanks, though.I found most of the bills

03:30.558 --> 03:33.169
that made it into the water.Okay, good.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.258
We need to get those dried,
those cleaned,

03:35.302 --> 03:38.000
get whatever's left in the bag
and then tally it all up.

03:40.045 --> 03:42.004
Say it. Just say it.I'm not saying anything.

03:42.047 --> 03:43.701
Oh, good. You're maturing.

03:43.745 --> 03:45.877
But you know what?
Actually, to tell you the truth,

03:45.921 --> 03:47.705
I think I would be
irresponsible...

03:47.749 --> 03:48.793
Here we go.

03:48.837 --> 03:50.099
...if I didn't tell you
how I think

03:50.142 --> 03:52.362
that burying Kamekona's money
in your backyard

03:52.406 --> 03:55.583
was the stupidest,
most ignorant, dumbest idea

03:55.626 --> 03:57.193
you ever had in the nine years
I've known you.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.499
The dumbest. Dumb,
dumb, dumb, dumb,

03:58.542 --> 04:00.196
dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.Okay, you done?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.111
Uh-huh.Good. 'Cause this
is partly your fault.

04:02.154 --> 04:03.504
Myfault?Yeah, partly. Yeah.

04:03.547 --> 04:05.593
How is it my fault?Okay, because you and Lou

04:05.636 --> 04:06.637
were supposed to be over here

04:06.681 --> 04:08.160
helping me and Junior
dig that hole.

04:08.204 --> 04:10.032
You guys never showed up,
all right?

04:10.075 --> 04:11.294
Then we had to leave

04:11.338 --> 04:12.817
and go to work,

04:12.861 --> 04:13.905
and if you had've shown up,
put your back

04:13.949 --> 04:15.777
into it for a minute,

04:15.820 --> 04:17.779
that hole
would have been deeper.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.607
What I think he's trying to say
is that, you know,

04:19.650 --> 04:21.173
i-it wasn't the plan.

04:21.217 --> 04:23.088
It was the execution of the plan
that's the problem. Right?

04:23.132 --> 04:25.177
Yeah. Yeah.Okay, okay, okay. You guys
want to know what I think now?

04:25.221 --> 04:26.875
Sure. Yeah.I'm gonna tell you anyway.

04:26.918 --> 04:29.138
I think what happened is,

04:29.181 --> 04:32.924
is that this man
behind me is so boring

04:32.968 --> 04:34.752
that this dog got so bored

04:34.796 --> 04:38.365
that he had nothing better to do
than to dig in the backyard.

04:38.408 --> 04:39.888
That's what I think. Well...What do you... I'm sorry.

04:39.931 --> 04:41.455
W-What are you talking about?Yeah, everybody knows

04:41.498 --> 04:43.195
you got to mentally stimulate
your dog,

04:43.239 --> 04:45.285
and if you don't,
they act out. See that?

04:45.328 --> 04:47.939
You got to mentally
stimulate the animal.Look at this dog.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.463
Look how stimulated this dog is.
I talk to him every day.

04:49.506 --> 04:51.595
What do you mean
he's feeling...?That's the problem.

04:51.639 --> 04:53.467
Come on, boy.You talk to him. You ever hear

04:53.510 --> 04:54.859
what comes out of your mouth?
You talk to the dog.

04:54.903 --> 04:57.645
Buy it a toy.
Buy it a stuffy.

04:57.688 --> 04:58.950
Buy it a-a bone. Something.

04:58.994 --> 05:00.474
A stuffy?A stu...

05:00.517 --> 05:02.911
A bully stick. I don't know.I-I know, buddy.

05:02.954 --> 05:04.652
I hate it when Mom
and Dad argue, too.

05:04.695 --> 05:06.218
[Eddie whines]It's okay.

05:07.611 --> 05:09.961
Well, don't just stand there
and be handsome. Say something.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.659
How'd it go with the governor?It went great.

05:11.702 --> 05:13.748
The CIA was there
delivering their brief,

05:13.791 --> 05:16.098
and the good news is that
the information we fed to Greer

05:16.141 --> 05:17.447
led to the capture and arrest

05:17.491 --> 05:19.449
of three members
of the Chinese spy network.

05:19.493 --> 05:20.668
And the bad news?

05:20.711 --> 05:22.496
Bad news is that they
must have wised up

05:22.539 --> 05:24.193
to the trap we sprung,
'cause they pulled the rest

05:24.236 --> 05:25.847
of their agents
out of the field.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.371
So why are you still pouting?

05:29.416 --> 05:32.070
Nobody has any idea
where Greer is.

05:32.114 --> 05:33.637
DANNY:
All right, look,

05:33.681 --> 05:35.073
you did what you thought
you had to do with Greer.

05:35.117 --> 05:36.597
It was the right
thing at the time.[phone ringing]

05:36.640 --> 05:37.772
You let her go, you let her go.

05:37.815 --> 05:39.295
Don't be so hard on yourself.Hold on.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.732
Hold on, hold on,
hold on. McGarrett.

05:41.776 --> 05:43.517
Yes.

05:44.561 --> 05:46.650
Yeah, we'll be right there.

05:46.694 --> 05:48.565
A plane just made
an emergency landing

05:48.609 --> 05:49.871
at Honolulu International.

05:49.914 --> 05:52.656
There was an explosion on board.

05:55.398 --> 05:59.228
[passengers screaming]

05:59.271 --> 06:01.361
Well, that's something
you don't see every day, huh?

06:01.404 --> 06:03.624
Got that right.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.626
FAA is in the process of
trying to gather all the data

06:05.669 --> 06:07.628
from the tower and
from the black box.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.194
If they can pinpoint

06:09.238 --> 06:10.848
the exact coordinates
where the door blew,

06:10.892 --> 06:12.633
there's a chance
we can figure out

06:12.676 --> 06:15.070
where those two
may have touched down.Right.

06:15.113 --> 06:16.941
If they didn't get sucked
into the jet on the way out.Okay.

06:16.985 --> 06:18.595
Can we just take into
consideration for a second

06:18.639 --> 06:19.596
the difficulty of that jump?

06:19.640 --> 06:20.858
There's very few people

06:20.902 --> 06:22.512
that could have
pulled that off.
Okay.

06:22.556 --> 06:24.296
So who's this guy?
He had to, uh...

06:24.340 --> 06:25.776
he had to go through security.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.517
He had to have a ticket, right?GROVER:
Nobody knows

06:27.561 --> 06:29.737
who he is. They thought
he was the air marshal.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.347
He was sitting
in the air marshal seat.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.871
But the air marshal assigned
to the flight never made it

06:33.915 --> 06:35.743
onto the plane
on account of he's dead.

06:35.786 --> 06:37.353
[mouths]Found his body in
his house in Dallas

06:37.397 --> 06:39.355
a couple hours ago.STEVE:
Okay.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.574
So this guy's using
the marshal's credentials

06:40.617 --> 06:42.532
to bypass security.
That explains how

06:42.576 --> 06:44.273
he got the gun and the
explosives on board the plane.

06:44.316 --> 06:46.144
DANNY: Why? Why-why
go through all that trouble?

06:46.188 --> 06:47.842
Right? Why not wait
till the guy lands, uh...

06:47.885 --> 06:49.887
pull up in your car,
put him in your trunk?

06:49.931 --> 06:52.150
Yeah, but we got to assume
that whoever executed this plan

06:52.194 --> 06:53.543
did so for a reason, right?

06:53.587 --> 06:55.153
I mean, they had to have figured

06:55.197 --> 06:56.677
that this was their best shot
at grabbing this guy alive.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.766
So, what's up with the victim?

06:58.809 --> 07:01.551
Our victim is Jack Teague.
He's a systems analyst

07:01.595 --> 07:03.466
from Plano, Texas.

07:03.510 --> 07:04.685
He works at one of
those big telecoms

07:04.728 --> 07:06.774
they got out there.

07:06.817 --> 07:08.471
That's his wife and daughter

07:08.515 --> 07:09.690
over there. According
to the wife,

07:09.733 --> 07:11.692
all they wanted to do
was come out here

07:11.735 --> 07:13.302
to spend a week at the Hilton.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.391
That's a nice start
of a vacation.
STEVE:
Can I presume

07:15.435 --> 07:16.740
she has no idea
why this happened?

07:16.784 --> 07:18.655
None. And I believe her.

07:18.699 --> 07:21.876
According to this woman,
her husband's a family man.

07:21.919 --> 07:24.618
Good husband.
Been working at his job

07:24.661 --> 07:26.794
more than ten years.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.317
The guy even coaches
his daughter's soccer team

07:28.360 --> 07:30.232
on the weekend.
DANNY:
So what do you think?

07:30.275 --> 07:31.886
A big case of mistaken identity
or what?

07:31.929 --> 07:33.496
STEVE:
Yeah.

07:33.540 --> 07:36.020
Or there's a whole bunch
we don't know about Jack Teague.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.951
[sneezes]

07:53.995 --> 07:56.127
[sniffles]

07:56.171 --> 07:58.129
MAN:
Well done, recruits.

07:58.173 --> 08:00.305
If your intention

08:00.349 --> 08:02.177
was to botch the crime scene,

08:02.220 --> 08:04.962
make sure any evidence
is not admissible in court,

08:05.006 --> 08:07.617
that was some top-notch work.

08:07.661 --> 08:10.272
Scene contamination.

08:10.315 --> 08:12.883
What did we say about gloves?

08:12.927 --> 08:15.146
U-Use them?

08:15.190 --> 08:16.626
The use of gloves

08:16.670 --> 08:20.238
does not guarantee that
there will not be contamination.

08:20.282 --> 08:22.327
Gloves themselves

08:22.371 --> 08:24.547
may become contaminated
through touching fluid,

08:24.591 --> 08:26.810
blood, and through
some not so obvious means,

08:26.854 --> 08:29.334
like scratching your nose,
Pearson,

08:29.378 --> 08:31.206
or sneezing

08:31.249 --> 08:33.208
just before you bag
the murder weapon, Olina.

08:33.251 --> 08:36.124
Any public defender

08:36.167 --> 08:38.648
straight out of law school
gets this case tossed,

08:38.692 --> 08:42.870
which means we have to let
a murderer go

08:42.913 --> 08:44.915
because you two were sloppy.[door opens]

08:44.959 --> 08:46.743
[footsteps approaching]

08:46.787 --> 08:48.440
[door closes]

08:50.399 --> 08:51.922
Okay.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.794
That's enough for today.

08:58.189 --> 08:59.364
Ms. Rey.

08:59.408 --> 09:01.323
Back at the scene of the crime.

09:01.366 --> 09:03.281
Please.

09:03.325 --> 09:04.544
Come on in.

09:04.587 --> 09:06.546
Thank you.

09:07.590 --> 09:10.767
Realize this is more
than a little awkward.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.682
Just do me a favor, all right?
If you're gonna throw

09:12.726 --> 09:14.423
another punch,
just avoid the face.

09:14.466 --> 09:16.338
I had a crown replaced.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.253
I know I've said this before,

09:18.296 --> 09:21.038
but I'm-I'm truly sorry
for that.

09:21.082 --> 09:23.650
Well, from where I'm standing,

09:23.693 --> 09:26.000
it seems like a pretty
smart career move.

09:26.043 --> 09:28.393
Get yourself booted
out of the academy,

09:28.437 --> 09:31.135
land a job with Five-O.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.095
There were a couple weeks
in between

09:34.138 --> 09:35.531
where I did some lifeguarding.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.707
You know, I, uh, ate some ramen

09:37.751 --> 09:39.622
and reflected on my mistakes.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.581
So, what can I do
for you, Ms. Rey?

09:41.624 --> 09:44.496
Okay, um...

09:47.238 --> 09:50.154
[sighs] This is crazy.
I was practicing

09:50.198 --> 09:52.417
what I was gonna say
the whole way over here,

09:52.461 --> 09:54.376
and now I'm standing
in front of you and...

09:54.419 --> 09:56.726
Aah, okay.
I'm just gonna say it.

09:56.770 --> 09:59.424
Captain Keo, I, uh...

09:59.468 --> 10:01.513
I need a favor from you.

10:01.557 --> 10:04.168
And it's a big one.

10:04.212 --> 10:07.258
And I realize you are
the last person on the planet

10:07.302 --> 10:09.391
I should be asking.

10:09.434 --> 10:11.393
But...

10:11.436 --> 10:14.483
y-you're the only person
that I can trust.

10:17.791 --> 10:20.663
Right. Um...

10:20.707 --> 10:23.971
I need you
to run ballistics on a gun

10:24.014 --> 10:25.363
to see if it comes back

10:25.407 --> 10:27.278
to any open cases, and...

10:27.322 --> 10:29.803
I need it done off the books.

10:33.328 --> 10:35.852
Well, from what I understand,
Commander McGarrett isn't really

10:35.896 --> 10:37.549
a stickler for the books, is he?

10:37.593 --> 10:39.203
So why do you need me?

10:39.247 --> 10:43.686
McGarrett's the one person
that can't know about this.

10:43.730 --> 10:46.341
Go on.

10:47.864 --> 10:51.085
I have a hunch about
the gun in question.

10:51.128 --> 10:53.304
And if I'm right,
it could incriminate

10:53.348 --> 10:55.306
someone who's really close
to McGarrett.

10:55.350 --> 10:57.395
If I'm wrong, um,

10:57.439 --> 11:01.312
it will completely destroy
my relationship with him

11:01.356 --> 11:04.185
and everybody else on the team.

11:04.228 --> 11:08.624
You know more than anyone else
how badly I messed up here.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.105
And how lucky I am
to have a job with Five-O.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.498
Aside from my brother,

11:13.542 --> 11:18.068
these people are the only family
that I have.

11:18.112 --> 11:20.157
And I can't risk losing them.

11:20.201 --> 11:22.246
You want to know why

11:22.290 --> 11:24.509
I was so tough on you when you
were in my class?

11:24.553 --> 11:29.210
It's 'cause you were the best
damn student I ever had.

11:29.253 --> 11:32.909
That's why I was so disappointed
with how things turned out.

11:32.953 --> 11:35.782
You know, you knew me before any
of this happened.

11:35.825 --> 11:39.089
And I trust that you know
the kind of person that I am.

11:39.133 --> 11:40.874
See, y-you tell me
you've changed,

11:40.917 --> 11:42.092
but you're coming here now,

11:42.136 --> 11:43.354
you're asking me to bend
the rules for you.

11:43.398 --> 11:45.487
No, I'm asking you to help me do
the right...

11:45.530 --> 11:46.923
You could have been a great cop.

11:46.967 --> 11:49.926
But instead,

11:49.970 --> 11:52.146
you're a woman who cheated
on her test

11:52.189 --> 11:54.670
and punched her instructor.

11:54.714 --> 11:58.195
You're a rule breaker, Ms. Rey.

11:58.239 --> 12:01.242
Now, that may be okay for you,
for Five-O,

12:01.285 --> 12:04.593
but it is not the way
I do things.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.118
I'm sorry.

12:08.162 --> 12:09.772
I can't help you out.

12:09.816 --> 12:12.732
Okay.

12:12.775 --> 12:14.559
I understand.

12:16.692 --> 12:19.695
[footsteps recede, door opens]

12:24.352 --> 12:26.528
Jerry, any updates?

12:26.571 --> 12:28.835
I just heard back from
the FAA, and using the data

12:28.878 --> 12:30.532
that they pulled,
I was able to pinpoint

12:30.575 --> 12:32.403
the plane's exact location

12:32.447 --> 12:34.275
the moment
the emergency door was blown,

12:34.318 --> 12:36.451
which puts our drop zone

12:36.494 --> 12:38.453
somewhere in this
30-mile radius.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.455
That's a lot of
jungle to search

12:40.498 --> 12:41.673
and we don't have
a ton of people.

12:41.717 --> 12:42.849
I can help you
out with that.

12:42.892 --> 12:44.372
I've been doing
some calculations.

12:44.415 --> 12:46.635
And based on wind speed,
altitude and drop rate,

12:46.678 --> 12:49.638
I think I can narrow down
our search area considerably.

12:49.681 --> 12:52.510
Hey, Jerry, can you plug in
these coordinates?

12:52.554 --> 12:54.382
Now factoring in
the average foot speed

12:54.425 --> 12:56.036
of four miles per hour,

12:56.079 --> 12:58.473
I think we can reduce the search
radius to eight square miles.

12:58.516 --> 13:00.388
That's some pretty dense
foliage.

13:00.431 --> 13:01.955
How do you even land
a parachute in that?

13:01.998 --> 13:04.522
Without breaking a leg,
it's not easy.

13:04.566 --> 13:06.873
Yeah, and your chute's gonna get
caught up in a tree for sure.

13:06.916 --> 13:09.963
Which may actually help us here.

13:10.006 --> 13:12.269
JERRY: So we're looking for
a parachute in this image.

13:12.313 --> 13:15.011
Yeah, I don't, uh,
I don't see one.

13:15.055 --> 13:16.621
Something else
we got going for us

13:16.665 --> 13:18.667
is this map is entirely
tree cover,

13:18.710 --> 13:19.842
which means it's almost
all green.

13:19.886 --> 13:22.540
So if we just filter
out that color...

13:22.584 --> 13:26.283
What's that?

13:26.327 --> 13:27.502
Boo-yah.

13:27.545 --> 13:30.287
Don't-don't-don't say "boo-yah."

13:30.331 --> 13:31.985
I mean, that was very good what
you did, but don't say boo-yah.

13:32.028 --> 13:34.683
STEVE:
All right, Danny, you go
with Tani and Junior,

13:34.726 --> 13:36.467
chopper out to the drop site.
Hopefully, you can pick up

13:36.511 --> 13:37.947
a trail from the landing point

13:37.991 --> 13:39.557
and track our targets through
the jungle from there.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.864
Cool. I'll call the helo
and let Tani know.

13:41.908 --> 13:42.952
All right.All right.

13:42.996 --> 13:45.520
Excuse me, um,
why don't you want to go?

13:45.563 --> 13:48.001
I mean, jumping out
of a helicopter,

13:48.044 --> 13:49.916
chasing bad guys in the jungle,
that's kind of like your jam.

13:49.959 --> 13:51.526
STEVE:
I mean, somebody's got

13:51.569 --> 13:53.354
to stay back here and
dig into Teague, right?

13:53.397 --> 13:54.964
Find out who he is,
why he was targeted.

13:55.008 --> 13:58.228
Besides, Danny,
y-you're plenty competent.

13:58.272 --> 13:59.882
Yeah, I-I don't,
I don't buy that.

13:59.926 --> 14:01.405
You're up to something and I'm
gonna figure out what it is.

14:01.449 --> 14:03.668
Okay. Well,
you're the detective.

14:03.712 --> 14:04.582
Thanks.

14:19.380 --> 14:20.642
DANNY:
That's it.

14:29.085 --> 14:31.522
Okay, so based on the way
that canopy's tangled up,

14:31.566 --> 14:34.308
I'd say they were suspended
about 15 feet off of the ground.

14:34.351 --> 14:38.486
Kidnapper must have used his
knife and cut the chute lines.

14:40.444 --> 14:42.707
TANI:
Impact marks over here.

14:42.751 --> 14:45.406
Looks like they fell
pretty hard.It's a pretty good drop.

14:45.449 --> 14:47.625
Let's assume one of them
or both of them are injured.

14:47.669 --> 14:49.801
Let's keep moving,
maybe we could catch up.

14:51.325 --> 14:53.370
JUNIOR:
Hey, I got something here.

14:53.414 --> 14:54.458
Let's move.

14:59.942 --> 15:03.554
TANI:
So these guys have, what,
like, two hours on us?

15:03.598 --> 15:05.469
What are the chances
that we catch up to them?

15:05.513 --> 15:07.950
Oh, you're starting
to sound like me.

15:07.994 --> 15:10.170
Listen, you got to have hope
when you do this job, right?

15:10.213 --> 15:11.432
You got to have hope.

15:11.475 --> 15:12.781
Hope you'll, uh,
catch a break.

15:12.824 --> 15:14.043
Hope you catch
the bad guys.

15:14.087 --> 15:15.784
Be realistic,
but you got to have hope.

15:15.827 --> 15:17.699
Thank you. I have hope,
I definitely have hope.

15:17.742 --> 15:19.570
It's just,
realistically speaking...

15:19.614 --> 15:21.094
Hey, got something.

15:24.358 --> 15:25.707
What were you saying?

15:25.750 --> 15:27.187
Never mind.

15:39.895 --> 15:41.723
He's dead.

15:43.725 --> 15:44.944
TANI:
That's not Teague.

15:44.987 --> 15:47.598
It's the kidnapper.

15:47.642 --> 15:49.731
Look, he's got no stab wounds,
no gunshot wounds,

15:49.774 --> 15:50.950
but he's got a broken neck.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.255
TANI:
Well, it can't be from the fall,

15:52.299 --> 15:54.344
otherwise his body would be back
by the chute.

15:54.388 --> 15:55.606
Yeah, you're right.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.217
It was deliberate;
someone snapped it.

16:05.355 --> 16:06.313
[knocking on door]

16:06.356 --> 16:07.662
Yo, anything on Teague?

16:07.705 --> 16:09.272
Only thing this guy
looks guilty of

16:09.316 --> 16:11.057
is being Father of the Year.

16:11.100 --> 16:14.669
Okay, I got something
for you to see. Follow me.

16:14.712 --> 16:18.281
So we've been trying to
figure out why the Chinese

16:18.325 --> 16:19.761
would go through
all that trouble

16:19.804 --> 16:22.024
to snatch a guy off
a plane in mid-flight.

16:22.068 --> 16:24.809
You yourself said
it had to be some kind

16:24.853 --> 16:26.768
of pressing emergency
in order

16:26.811 --> 16:29.858
to get this guy off the plane
before it lands. Well...

16:29.901 --> 16:32.643
I decided to look into
what was going on

16:32.687 --> 16:35.864
at the Honolulu airport around
the time of the abduction.

16:39.781 --> 16:42.740
You recognize anybody sitting
around, waiting around there?

16:42.784 --> 16:44.655
STEVE:
Is that... That's Agent Miller.

16:44.699 --> 16:45.874
GROVER:
Exactly.

16:45.917 --> 16:47.528
Which got me to thinking.

16:47.571 --> 16:49.965
Why in the hell would the CIA
be sitting at an arrival gate

16:50.009 --> 16:52.098
waiting to meet Ward Cleaver?

16:52.141 --> 16:54.274
I got a better question.
Why is Miller there at all?

16:54.317 --> 16:56.711
Greer was his partner.

16:56.754 --> 16:59.018
Now, when she was exposed
as a Chinese asset,

16:59.061 --> 17:02.238
there's no way the Agency's
keeping this guy on active duty.

17:02.282 --> 17:03.805
The standard operating procedure
would be to...

17:03.848 --> 17:07.809
to put him on paid leave
pending a security evaluation.

17:07.852 --> 17:10.072
I guess we can all agree
that Miller has gone rogue.

17:10.116 --> 17:12.988
It would explain why the CIA
didn't bother notifying us.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.208
All right.
We need to find out

17:15.251 --> 17:16.818
what the hell Miller
has to do with Teague.

17:16.861 --> 17:19.212
Let's run his phone,
his financials,

17:19.255 --> 17:21.040
see if we can figure out where
he's staying on the island.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.912
JERRY:
Hey, guys, you
got to see this.

17:23.955 --> 17:26.132
This computer was retrieved from
Jack Teague's carry-on luggage.

17:26.175 --> 17:28.221
Now, a routine scan turned up
nothing out of the ordinary,

17:28.264 --> 17:30.832
but when I dug deeper,
boo-yah.

17:32.834 --> 17:35.663
Last time, I promise. Anyway,

17:35.706 --> 17:37.708
I found an
encrypted partition

17:37.752 --> 17:41.103
and check out what's on it.

17:41.147 --> 17:43.323
Are these in Chinese?

17:43.366 --> 17:45.368
What would Father of the Year
Jack Teague be doing

17:45.412 --> 17:48.067
with a bunch of Chinese
documents hidden behind
a secret partition?

17:51.983 --> 17:55.335
Hi. Yeah, no. That, uh,
that changes things, I guess.

17:55.378 --> 17:57.641
Okay, so it turns out Teague
was not the, uh,

17:57.685 --> 17:59.078
all-American father
we thought he was.

17:59.121 --> 18:00.470
Who is he?

18:00.514 --> 18:02.124
He's a Chinese spy.

18:02.168 --> 18:04.344
â™ª

18:16.617 --> 18:17.922
STEVE:
You know something,

18:17.966 --> 18:19.837
this has, uh,
surprisingly good pickup.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.797
You want to take it easy?

18:22.840 --> 18:25.191
What are you talking
about? I'm doing 35.

18:25.234 --> 18:29.717
My wife refers to her car
as her third child,

18:29.760 --> 18:33.373
which means it's a really big
deal just for me to borrow it.

18:33.416 --> 18:36.854
This thing has
to get home unscathed.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.943
That way I can live another day,

18:38.987 --> 18:41.381
and I can go pick my own car up
from the shop tomorrow.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.687
Relax, please.
Would you relax?

18:43.731 --> 18:45.167
I'm an excellent
driver, all right?

18:45.211 --> 18:47.082
Let's just not think
about the car anymore.

18:47.126 --> 18:48.475
Let's focus on the case.

18:48.518 --> 18:51.347
Speaking of which, you know,
if you told me right now

18:51.391 --> 18:53.958
that you were a member
of some rogue spy agency

18:54.002 --> 18:55.438
out of China,
I'd probably believe it.

18:55.482 --> 18:57.440
They got everybody
and their mama on the payroll.

18:57.484 --> 18:58.963
Well, you know,
that's what happens

18:59.007 --> 19:00.835
when one of these covert
networks gets exposed.

19:00.878 --> 19:02.793
Everybody surfaces
and runs for cover.

19:02.837 --> 19:04.578
Yeah, Teague included.

19:04.621 --> 19:06.188
So I'm thinking Teague
must have got word

19:06.232 --> 19:09.148
that he was about to be
exposed as a Chinese spy,

19:09.191 --> 19:11.933
and he grabs his family,
heads to Hawaii

19:11.976 --> 19:13.239
under the cover
of a vacation.

19:13.282 --> 19:14.588
Well, that makes sense.

19:14.631 --> 19:16.807
Hawaii's about halfway
to China.

19:16.851 --> 19:18.679
Hell, this could be
the first leg

19:18.722 --> 19:20.681
of him escaping
the country altogether.

19:20.724 --> 19:21.899
It is possible.

19:21.943 --> 19:23.379
But then Miller finds
out what's going on,

19:23.423 --> 19:26.426
he's waiting here
to intercept Teague.

19:26.469 --> 19:28.819
And then the Chinese somehow
get wind of that plan,

19:28.863 --> 19:31.953
and concoct some crazy scheme
of snatching him in midair.

19:31.996 --> 19:33.302
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

19:33.346 --> 19:35.391
The Chinese had to have
had advance knowledge

19:35.435 --> 19:36.914
that Teague was gonna be
on that flight, right?

19:36.958 --> 19:38.786
Yeah.
Why would they go
to all the trouble

19:38.829 --> 19:41.180
of killing an air marshal,

19:41.223 --> 19:42.833
putting a kidnapper
on the plane,

19:42.877 --> 19:44.052
when, really, they could
have just grabbed Teague

19:44.095 --> 19:46.141
before he got to the
airport in Dallas?

19:46.185 --> 19:49.013
Well, you got me there;
I got no answer.And not to mention,

19:49.057 --> 19:51.233
if that kidnapper was put
in place to prevent Teague

19:51.277 --> 19:55.106
from falling into CIA hands,
why does Teague kill the guy?

19:55.150 --> 19:57.674
All right, now I'm starting
to get a headache.
[sighs]

19:57.718 --> 19:59.502
Hopefully, Miller can
shed some light on this,

19:59.546 --> 20:01.461
'cause right now
nothing adds up.

20:08.729 --> 20:11.427
JUNIOR:
Okay, I got something here.

20:13.908 --> 20:16.432
All right, no boot treads.

20:16.476 --> 20:18.260
That looks like a loafer,
that should be Teague's print.

20:18.304 --> 20:20.262
JUNIOR:
Okay.

20:20.306 --> 20:22.264
So he went through the water.
Okay, that's smart.

20:22.308 --> 20:26.007
He's trying to throw off
any of his pursuers.

20:26.050 --> 20:27.791
I'm thinking that he went
upstream, he crossed over,

20:27.835 --> 20:29.097
and then he carried on
in that direction, right?

20:29.140 --> 20:32.405
I don't know. Something
feels off to me.

20:32.448 --> 20:34.058
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah.

20:34.102 --> 20:37.888
The trail is pretty clear.That's the problem.

20:37.932 --> 20:40.239
What are you thinking?I'm thinking that sometimes

20:40.282 --> 20:42.023
when evidence seems, uh,

20:42.066 --> 20:43.851
too good to be true,
it's because it is, right?

20:43.894 --> 20:45.853
This guy, he knows
that somebody's

20:45.896 --> 20:47.724
out here looking for him,
he knows he's being tracked.

20:47.768 --> 20:49.073
This thing with the river,

20:49.117 --> 20:51.250
it's a good idea, but it
seems a little obvious.

20:51.293 --> 20:53.034
I've, personally, seen
it a million times.

20:53.077 --> 20:54.209
You have?

20:54.253 --> 20:56.559
I have. You, uh...

20:56.603 --> 20:58.605
remember The Fugitive?

20:58.648 --> 21:00.955
The movie?
Uh, yes, movie.

21:00.998 --> 21:02.957
It was also a highly underrated
television show from the '60s.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.785
But that in no way
invalidates my point.

21:04.828 --> 21:06.830
The point is this:
you got to always

21:06.874 --> 21:10.094
be thinking, why do I
believe what I believe?

21:10.138 --> 21:12.009
Right? Am I missing something?

21:12.053 --> 21:13.663
Or am I not missing anything?

21:13.707 --> 21:15.274
Right? Sometimes the
most obvious leads,

21:15.317 --> 21:16.753
they turn out to be
wild goose chases.

21:16.797 --> 21:18.929
Why? Because you went
for an easy assumption.

21:18.973 --> 21:20.670
Right?

21:20.714 --> 21:22.019
This.

21:22.063 --> 21:23.934
You, uh... you ever
been to Hollywood?

21:23.978 --> 21:25.849
To Los Angeles.
The Walk of Fame.

21:25.893 --> 21:27.416
They got all the jerks,
they put their...

21:27.460 --> 21:29.200
footprints in the--
That's what this looks like.Mm.

21:29.244 --> 21:31.942
Deliberate.
Like someone did it on purpose.

21:31.986 --> 21:33.509
This does not look like
the footprint of a man

21:33.553 --> 21:34.510
who's running scared
for his life.

21:34.554 --> 21:36.207
Have a look.

21:36.251 --> 21:38.035
Okay.

21:41.038 --> 21:42.126
DANNY: Now what
do you think?

21:42.170 --> 21:43.606
[grunting]JUNIOR: I-I'm thinking

21:43.650 --> 21:45.434
that he went up this tree here,

21:45.478 --> 21:48.002
crossed, went over.

21:50.004 --> 21:52.267
Okay. He dropped down here.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.616
Good, good.So he went

21:53.660 --> 21:56.097
that way, all right?
Not that way.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.926
Yeah.
Okay. Cool.

21:58.969 --> 22:02.233
Hey, we don't need to tell
McGarrett about this, right?

22:02.277 --> 22:04.061
Tell him about what?

22:04.105 --> 22:06.063
You schooling a Navy SEAL
on how to track someone.Oh, come on.

22:06.107 --> 22:07.456
That didn't happen.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.545
I mean, it happened
a little bit, but not--

22:09.589 --> 22:11.765
That wasn't, you know--Yeah, just a little bit.
All right?

22:11.808 --> 22:14.028
[beeping]
JUNIOR:
Hey.

22:14.071 --> 22:15.682
Well, thanks
to Detective Williams,

22:15.725 --> 22:17.074
we're back on Teague's trail.

22:17.118 --> 22:19.076
Okay, good. I'm sending
these pictures to Jerry.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.730
Maybe he can ID him.

22:20.774 --> 22:22.950
Also, I found this
interesting piece of equipment.

22:22.993 --> 22:26.257
Looks like some sort
of injection device.

22:26.301 --> 22:28.129
Could be used to sedate him
during the jump.

22:28.172 --> 22:29.739
Let me see that.

22:32.002 --> 22:34.091
No, I've seen
this type of tech before.

22:34.135 --> 22:36.485
They inject a GPS
implant into the subject

22:36.529 --> 22:37.399
so he can be tracked. [shouts]

22:37.443 --> 22:38.966
Yeah, that makes sense,

22:39.009 --> 22:40.881
considering how valuable
he is to the Chinese.

22:40.924 --> 22:43.144
It's their insurance, in case he
gets lost during the extraction.

22:43.187 --> 22:44.624
All right, he's got a GPS.
Let's go.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.582
It'll make our job easier.Yeah, except

22:46.626 --> 22:49.106
it looks like the
receiver is missing, so...

22:49.150 --> 22:50.847
Teague must've taken it
to prevent anyone

22:50.891 --> 22:52.588
from tracking him.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.157
GROVER: Good afternoon,
Agent Miller.

22:56.200 --> 22:57.985
My name is Captain Lou Grover.

22:58.028 --> 23:00.161
I'm with the Five-O Task Force.

23:00.204 --> 23:01.641
I was wondering
if you had a few minutes.

23:01.684 --> 23:03.643
I'd like to ask you
some questions.

23:03.686 --> 23:05.471
How'd you find me here?Who do you think
you're talking to, man?

23:05.514 --> 23:06.994
I'm the police.

23:07.037 --> 23:08.430
It's what I do.

23:08.474 --> 23:11.041
Please, it'll only
take a few minutes.

23:12.086 --> 23:14.218
Yeah, that doesn't work for me.

23:14.262 --> 23:15.611
So, unless you have a warrant

23:15.655 --> 23:17.526
or you plan on charging me
with something,

23:17.570 --> 23:19.093
I'd like you to leave.

23:19.136 --> 23:21.095
All right. Fine.

23:21.138 --> 23:22.705
I was just trying to stall you

23:22.749 --> 23:25.229
long enough for my colleague
to break into your room.

23:25.273 --> 23:26.448
Whatever.

23:27.623 --> 23:29.016
[pants]

23:39.505 --> 23:41.855
I got to say, for somebody
who's supposed to be on leave,

23:41.898 --> 23:44.031
it looks like you've been
keeping yourself pretty busy.

23:44.074 --> 23:45.511
Why don't you two skip
to the part where you tell me

23:45.554 --> 23:47.121
what this is about.Okay.

23:47.164 --> 23:49.602
Works for me.[phone beeps]

23:49.645 --> 23:51.821
All right, champ.
That's you

23:51.865 --> 23:54.041
at HNL arrivals today,
waiting for Jack Teague's plane

23:54.084 --> 23:56.739
to arrive.Here's the thing,
we know that Teague's

23:56.783 --> 23:58.132
been working for the Chinese.

23:58.175 --> 23:59.873
What we don't know
and we can't figure out

23:59.916 --> 24:01.962
is why you were there
waiting for him.

24:05.095 --> 24:07.054
[chuckles]

24:07.097 --> 24:10.971
30 years I gave the agency.

24:11.014 --> 24:13.147
That's all out the window,

24:13.190 --> 24:14.975
thanks to Greer.

24:15.018 --> 24:16.150
She's the traitor.

24:16.193 --> 24:17.760
I'm the
collateral damage.

24:17.804 --> 24:21.155
I wasn't gonna wait around
for some suits

24:21.198 --> 24:22.852
at Langley to
clear my name.

24:22.896 --> 24:25.246
So you're, what, taking things
into your own hands?

24:25.289 --> 24:26.334
Running my own investigation,
yes.

24:26.377 --> 24:28.423
And you know what I found out?

24:28.467 --> 24:30.207
Teague's one of ours.

24:30.251 --> 24:31.557
GROVER:
Wait, what?

24:31.600 --> 24:33.254
MILLER:
Jack Teague

24:33.297 --> 24:34.734
has been working
as a double agent,

24:34.777 --> 24:37.258
feeding counterintelligence
to the Chinese.

24:37.301 --> 24:38.259
They've been
cultivating Americans

24:38.302 --> 24:40.043
for intelligence assets
for years.

24:40.087 --> 24:43.133
Wait a minute, you gave Teague
deep cover and then you hang him

24:43.177 --> 24:44.526
out there
like a carrot.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.746
MSS eventually
recruits him,

24:46.789 --> 24:48.095
and now you got a
man on the inside

24:48.138 --> 24:49.270
of Chinese intelligence
operations.

24:49.313 --> 24:50.663
Is that right?That's exactly right.

24:50.706 --> 24:52.273
Except the whole thing unraveled

24:52.316 --> 24:54.536
when you exposed
their spy network.

24:55.581 --> 24:58.148
All right, so Teague
is one of ours.

24:58.192 --> 25:00.194
Well, then why didn't
he just come in?

25:00.237 --> 25:01.195
You have to
look at it

25:01.238 --> 25:03.110
from his point of view.

25:03.153 --> 25:04.764
His handler's murdered.

25:04.807 --> 25:06.113
Guy's spooked.
He doesn't know

25:06.156 --> 25:08.115
whether his
cover's been blown

25:08.158 --> 25:09.464
or who to trust.
So I reached out.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.074
I offered him
protection.

25:11.118 --> 25:12.467
I-I call in a couple of favors.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.338
I get a team shadowing him
on the ground in Dallas.

25:14.382 --> 25:15.688
They put him
on the plane

25:15.731 --> 25:17.559
to Oahu. The plan
is for me to meet him there,

25:17.603 --> 25:19.343
take him and his family
to a safe house.

25:19.387 --> 25:22.521
Clearly the Chinese got wind
of what was going on, okay,

25:22.564 --> 25:24.566
and they grabbed him
the one time they could.

25:24.610 --> 25:25.915
Yeah.

25:25.959 --> 25:26.916
On a plane.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.439
Mid-flight.Yeah, and I have

25:28.483 --> 25:30.529
no idea how the Chinese knew
that I was bringing Teague in.

25:30.572 --> 25:32.269
But if I had to guess,

25:32.313 --> 25:34.576
I would say that Greer
was involved somehow.

25:34.620 --> 25:36.360
Yeah, well,
that would be consistent

25:36.404 --> 25:38.014
with what we know about her,
wouldn't it?

25:38.058 --> 25:39.973
MILLER: The bottom line is we
got about 12 hours to get Teague

25:40.016 --> 25:41.409
back into American hands.

25:41.452 --> 25:43.324
That's how long it takes
the Chinese to debrief him,

25:43.367 --> 25:45.587
find out what disinformation
he's been feeding them,

25:45.631 --> 25:48.372
and, uh, extract
whatever intelligence he has

25:48.416 --> 25:49.678
on U.S. spy operations.

25:49.722 --> 25:51.898
'Cause after that,
he's a dead man.

25:51.941 --> 25:53.900
Well, we've got reason

25:53.943 --> 25:57.251
to be a little bit
more optimistic than that.

25:57.294 --> 25:59.906
We got a team on the ground
in that jungle right now.

25:59.949 --> 26:01.255
They've already
found the kidnapper

26:01.298 --> 26:02.909
who grabbed Teague
off the plane.

26:02.952 --> 26:04.258
He's dead.

26:04.301 --> 26:06.086
Looks like Teague
overpowered him

26:06.129 --> 26:07.914
and is on the run.So, with any luck,

26:07.957 --> 26:09.132
we'll find him
before the Chinese do.

26:09.176 --> 26:11.308
Yeah, there's only one problem
with that.

26:11.352 --> 26:12.919
What's that?As soon as I heard
what happened

26:12.962 --> 26:15.312
on the plane, I deployed
a search team to the jungle.

26:15.356 --> 26:16.400
They were in regular comms

26:16.444 --> 26:17.880
till 30 minutes ago.

26:17.924 --> 26:19.273
Since then,
nothing.

26:20.970 --> 26:23.190
[phone beeps]

26:23.233 --> 26:24.931
Danny, yeah, listen to me,
be advised,

26:24.974 --> 26:27.324
there is
a CIA Special Activities team

26:27.368 --> 26:29.239
in that jungle right now
looking for Teague.

26:29.283 --> 26:31.241
DANNY:
Yeah, we just found 'em.

26:31.285 --> 26:32.678
They're all dead.

26:32.721 --> 26:34.070
How many?

26:34.114 --> 26:35.071
Six of 'em.

26:35.115 --> 26:36.464
All special ops.

26:36.507 --> 26:38.205
They were all killed
by automatic weapons.

26:38.248 --> 26:40.250
All right, and the only gun
I'm aware of

26:40.294 --> 26:42.644
is the 9mm that Teague
took off the kidnapper.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.472
Danny, Teague's one of us.

26:44.515 --> 26:46.474
He's a double agent. We just
found out. He didn't do this.

26:46.517 --> 26:48.302
Okay, then who did?

26:48.345 --> 26:50.347
There's got to be a Chinese
extraction team in that jungle

26:50.391 --> 26:52.045
hunting Teague.

26:59.182 --> 27:01.358

â™ª

28:29.838 --> 28:32.885
[handcuffs clicking]

28:32.928 --> 28:34.060
Teague got away.

28:34.103 --> 28:35.191
TANI:
What?

28:35.235 --> 28:36.932
He was right here.
How is that possible?

28:36.976 --> 28:39.892
I don't know, I don't know.
He either, uh, disappeared

28:39.935 --> 28:41.894
into thin air,
or he jumped off

28:41.937 --> 28:42.764
of a hundred-foot
cliff into...

28:42.808 --> 28:44.548
into a river.

28:45.898 --> 28:48.727
Jun, let's, uh, get Jerry to
redirect satellite surveillance.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.293
We got to see where
that river ends, okay?

28:50.337 --> 28:51.730
Yes, sir.

28:51.773 --> 28:54.123
You, is this over?

28:54.167 --> 28:57.474
Are there more people
looking for Teague right now?

28:59.781 --> 29:00.956
It's okay. You don't got
to say anything.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.131
I already know the answer.

29:02.175 --> 29:04.786
Um, all right, let's,
uh... let's have

29:04.830 --> 29:07.180
you guys rendezvous with HPD.
Set up a tight perimeter.

29:07.223 --> 29:09.530
We cannot let this guy
get out of this jungle.

29:09.573 --> 29:11.314
What do we do with her?Are you kidding me?

29:11.358 --> 29:13.229
Her. This is-- this is
a gift. I'm taking her

29:13.273 --> 29:15.275
to Steve myself.
Come on.
[grunting]

29:17.016 --> 29:19.018
[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

29:31.552 --> 29:32.901
Steve, you
look flustered.

29:32.945 --> 29:35.338
Everything okay?

29:41.867 --> 29:43.129
Make the call.

29:43.172 --> 29:44.130
I'm sorry,

29:44.173 --> 29:45.522
who is it you want me to call?

29:45.566 --> 29:48.525
You still got men
in the field, all right?

29:48.569 --> 29:50.789
Call 'em. Tell 'em
Teague's in custody.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.486
They need to stand down.

29:52.529 --> 29:54.314
Why would I tell them that
when it's clearly a lie?

29:54.357 --> 29:55.837
Look, you took an oath

29:55.881 --> 29:57.447
to serve and protect
your country.

29:57.491 --> 29:59.710
I'm counting on there
still being some-some shred

29:59.754 --> 30:02.844
of honor and decency inside of
you that still cares about that.

30:02.888 --> 30:06.239
The last time I saw you,
you asked me why I did it.

30:06.282 --> 30:10.330
Well, here's my answer:
why not?

30:10.373 --> 30:13.072
You like to pretend the
work we do is so noble.

30:13.115 --> 30:14.900
It's not.

30:14.943 --> 30:16.118
We've armed governments

30:16.162 --> 30:18.729
who use weapons
against their own people.

30:18.773 --> 30:20.470
Interfered in elections.

30:20.514 --> 30:22.255
Propped up
dictators.

30:22.298 --> 30:23.865
Tortured innocent people.

30:23.909 --> 30:24.953
This island you call home?

30:24.997 --> 30:27.303
It's only American soil now

30:27.347 --> 30:28.783
because we staged a coup here,

30:28.827 --> 30:30.872
overthrew its rightful monarchy,
and then covered it up.

30:30.916 --> 30:33.614
All right, thanks for the
history lesson. I appreciate it.

30:33.657 --> 30:36.617
The point is, it takes
doing this job to realize

30:36.660 --> 30:38.706
there's no right or wrong.So, what,

30:38.749 --> 30:40.795
there's no right or wrong? What,
so just be in it for yourself?

30:40.839 --> 30:42.884
Why not be in it for yourself?
Is that what you're saying?

30:42.928 --> 30:44.146
[sighs]

30:44.190 --> 30:47.062
You think
you're such a good guy, Steve.

30:47.106 --> 30:49.064
But you've done things.

30:49.108 --> 30:51.850
Bad things.

30:51.893 --> 30:53.895
You can tell yourself
they were in the name

30:53.939 --> 30:55.854
of doing some
greater good.

30:55.897 --> 30:57.943
But were they, really?

30:59.031 --> 31:01.033
And no matter
how you dress this up,

31:01.076 --> 31:03.513
this whole thing
is about money to you. Yeah.

31:04.906 --> 31:08.257
I won't lie.
The Chinese pay very well.

31:09.302 --> 31:10.912
All right. Well,

31:10.956 --> 31:12.044
you know what?
Here's the good news.

31:12.087 --> 31:14.394
You have the rest
of your life

31:14.437 --> 31:16.918
in an eight-by-eight-foot cell
to figure out

31:16.962 --> 31:18.920
if that payday
really was worth it.

31:19.965 --> 31:21.444
[lock buzzes, latch clicks]

31:22.837 --> 31:24.839
Steve.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.456
So I dumped Greer's phone

31:33.500 --> 31:35.067
and found some
highly-sophisticated spyware

31:35.110 --> 31:38.200
on it that she's been using
to monitor Agent Miller's comms:

31:38.244 --> 31:40.899
his texts, his e-mail,
his phone calls, the works.

31:40.942 --> 31:43.466
STEVE:
And that explains how
Teague was made, how

31:43.510 --> 31:44.946
the Chinese knew
he'd be on that plane.

31:44.990 --> 31:47.209
JERRY: And one more thing.
Miller received a phone call

31:47.253 --> 31:50.038
less than 20 minutes ago
from a local landline.

31:52.171 --> 31:54.173
DANNY:
That's less

31:54.216 --> 31:56.436
than five miles
from where I saw Teague last.

31:56.479 --> 31:58.307
Yeah, alarm system was
triggered at the location

31:58.351 --> 32:00.048
just before the
call went out.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.223
Only one person that could be.

32:05.227 --> 32:06.925
[phone ringing]Commander McGarrett?

32:06.968 --> 32:08.317
STEVE:
Where are you?

32:08.361 --> 32:09.797
I'm picking up Teague.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.191
I'll call you as soon as
I have him in a secure location.

32:12.234 --> 32:14.367
No. Listen to me. Listen to me,
Miller. You have been

32:14.410 --> 32:16.064
completely compromised,
you understand?

32:16.108 --> 32:18.893
Greer was up on your phone,
which means we have to assume

32:18.937 --> 32:20.155
the Chinese have
your current location.

32:20.199 --> 32:22.331
We're gonna
take care of that.

32:22.375 --> 32:24.768
It's a through-and-through.
I'll live.

32:24.812 --> 32:26.857
My family?
They're safe.

32:26.901 --> 32:28.555
I made sure of it.

32:28.598 --> 32:29.991
Miller, listen to me, all right?

32:30.035 --> 32:31.384
Just tell us where you are,
where we can pick you up

32:31.427 --> 32:33.081
from, and then dump your cell.

32:33.125 --> 32:35.083
[tires squealing,

Hey! Miller!

[dialing]

33:47.242 --> 33:48.417
Hey.

33:48.461 --> 33:50.550
Teague is nowhere
to be found.

33:50.593 --> 33:52.160
Yeah. Looks like
the Chinese finally got to him.

33:52.204 --> 33:53.944
Who knows where they
would have taken him.

33:53.988 --> 33:55.250
I can tell you
somebody who knows.

33:55.294 --> 33:56.599
Yeah, Greer.
GROVER:
She ain't gonna

33:56.643 --> 33:58.210
give you any intel.

33:58.253 --> 34:00.299
You're gonna have to give her
something, like, right now.

34:00.342 --> 34:02.257
Teague's life is on the clock.STEVE: All right, look,

34:02.301 --> 34:04.651
before I crawl back
in there to make a deal,

34:04.694 --> 34:06.218
I want to try something
else. You guys,

34:06.261 --> 34:09.047
you said that Miller's car
was run off the road, right?

34:09.090 --> 34:11.875
Can you go and find some
evidence that might help us ID

34:11.919 --> 34:13.312
the suspect vehicle, please?

34:13.355 --> 34:14.400
Yeah. On it.

34:14.443 --> 34:16.663
I got broken glass.

34:16.706 --> 34:19.231
Got black paint transfer
on the driver's side.

Hey. I got

from the other car.

Perfect.

34:22.451 --> 34:23.757
That's great.
Look inside

gonna see either

34:25.454 --> 34:27.717

or a part number.

the local traffic cam logs.

34:46.606 --> 34:48.999
JERRY: Got it. Uh, looks like
they ran a red light less than

34:49.043 --> 34:51.001
five minutes ago. They're headed
east on Farrington.

34:51.045 --> 34:53.787
East on Farrington?
That doesn't make any sense.

34:53.830 --> 34:55.310
Why the hell would
they be headed

downtown Honolulu?

I'm so glad you're okay.DANNY:
I want...

36:16.957 --> 36:18.480
I want to ask you
a question, okay?Okay.

36:18.524 --> 36:20.395
All seriousness, why did you
send me into the jungle

36:20.439 --> 36:22.092
with those two? I just...
I need to know. Please.

36:22.136 --> 36:24.007
You still haven't
figured that out?No, I haven't.

36:24.051 --> 36:25.835
That's why I'm asking.Okay. Okay,
I sent you out there

36:25.879 --> 36:27.489
so they could learn
something from you,

36:27.533 --> 36:29.752
because every time I'm around,
Danny, you're more than happy

36:29.796 --> 36:31.711
to let them defer to me, okay?That's the stupidest thing

36:31.754 --> 36:34.104
you ever done
since I known you.
Oh, it is?

36:34.148 --> 36:35.497
Yeah, absolutely.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.064
Oh, so burying Kamekona's
cash in my backyard--

36:37.107 --> 36:39.153
that's been dethroned as the
dumbest thing I've ever done?

36:39.197 --> 36:40.241
Do I look like
a jungle person to you?

36:40.285 --> 36:41.503
Like I'd do well
in the jungle?

36:41.547 --> 36:42.461
Like a teachable moment's
gonna come out of me

36:42.504 --> 36:44.027
in a jungle setting?
Okay.

36:44.071 --> 36:45.507
So what you're saying is y-you
didn't teach 'em anything,

36:45.551 --> 36:46.595
they didn't learn a thing?

36:46.639 --> 36:47.988
I didn't say that.
I definitely had a,

36:48.031 --> 36:49.555
you know, couple good moments,
couple jams I dropped.

36:49.598 --> 36:50.947
That's what I'm th... Good.
That's what I'm talking about.

36:50.991 --> 36:52.166
And by the way, in the future,

36:52.210 --> 36:53.515
you should look to
do more of this.

36:53.559 --> 36:54.951
What, do I look like
Mr. Miyagi to you?

36:54.995 --> 36:56.431
No, you don't look like

36:56.475 --> 36:58.041
Mr. Miyagi, but I want you
to teach 'em what you know

36:58.085 --> 36:59.608
about being the good cop
that you are, all right?

36:59.652 --> 37:01.219
Okay. All right.
All right.
That's it.

Buddy, what's going on?

37:03.351 --> 37:04.352
Why are you upset?

Oh, I'm not upset.

Listen to me.

A couple of days
in the shop,

this thing-- good as new.

I'll call an Uber.

37:31.553 --> 37:33.294
You know I can't
go home now, right?

37:33.338 --> 37:34.513
It's all right.

37:34.556 --> 37:36.297
I'm moving in with you,

37:36.341 --> 37:38.908
and when I'm sitting at your
breakfast table in my drawers

37:38.952 --> 37:41.563
eating a bowl of Fruit Loops--
then it'll be funny.

37:41.607 --> 37:43.870
Oh, yeah, that'll be funny.

38:04.499 --> 38:07.502
This morning,
when you came and saw me,

38:07.546 --> 38:09.809
said that Five-O
was your only family

38:09.852 --> 38:12.202
aside from your brother,
that got me thinking.

38:12.246 --> 38:14.379
Okay.

38:14.422 --> 38:16.859
So I looked into you.

38:16.903 --> 38:19.427
You lost your father last year.

38:19.471 --> 38:22.212
I did.

38:22.256 --> 38:24.737
Well, my understanding is
that was just two days

38:24.780 --> 38:27.305
before our little altercation
in the classroom.

38:30.569 --> 38:32.527
Yeah, I...

38:32.571 --> 38:35.922
I didn't want to use that
as an excuse.

38:35.965 --> 38:37.706
My father

38:37.750 --> 38:39.229
would've hated that.

38:39.273 --> 38:40.709
Well, considering
it would have

38:40.753 --> 38:43.625
saved your ass and kept you
in the academy, that's

38:43.669 --> 38:47.063
very noble of you,
or pretty stupid.

38:47.107 --> 38:48.674
I can't tell which.

38:48.717 --> 38:50.719
Listen, I didn't

38:50.763 --> 38:53.069
come here
to drag all that stuff up again.

38:54.157 --> 38:56.377
Why'd you come here, then?

38:56.421 --> 38:59.380
The gun.
I'll run it for you.

39:00.425 --> 39:03.950
Thank you. Um, I can...

39:03.993 --> 39:05.386
I'll bring it
to you tomorrow.

39:05.430 --> 39:06.648
Don't thank me yet.

39:06.692 --> 39:08.694
You don't know
what I'm gonna find.

39:31.717 --> 39:33.719
Let's go.

39:40.682 --> 39:43.163
Congratulations.

39:43.206 --> 39:46.427
For what?

39:46.471 --> 39:49.125
No American has ever been
charged under the Espionage Act.

39:49.169 --> 39:51.301
It looks like you're
gonna be the first.

39:52.433 --> 39:54.609
Do you remember
Marrakesh, Steve?

39:54.653 --> 39:57.220
What's that got to
do with anything?

39:57.264 --> 40:01.834
It's actually what we did before
we jumped into bed.

40:03.966 --> 40:05.751
I always worried
our enemies would know

40:05.794 --> 40:07.274
it was us, and retaliate,

40:07.317 --> 40:08.493
but I had the comfort

40:08.536 --> 40:10.625
of knowing you never
would have implicated me,

40:10.669 --> 40:12.627
as I'm sure you knew
that as long

40:12.671 --> 40:15.717
as we were on the same side,
I wouldn't implicate you.

40:15.761 --> 40:18.154
You threatening me?

40:18.198 --> 40:20.505
Just stating the facts.

40:21.549 --> 40:23.769
Facts.

40:23.812 --> 40:28.513
You know as well as I do,
we were just following orders.

40:28.556 --> 40:32.865
That won't matter
to the people who want answers.

40:36.085 --> 40:37.522
Get her out of here.
