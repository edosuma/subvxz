00:06.560 --> 00:08.080
Doward,

00:08.080 --> 00:10.280
is the device gone?

00:10.280 --> 00:11.680
Aye, sir.

00:11.680 --> 00:13.080
Where's DCI Silva?

00:13.080 --> 00:14.560
She's gone to shower.

00:17.680 --> 00:19.600
And what about her suit -
where's that?

00:19.600 --> 00:20.720
I'm getting rid of it.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.680
No, no, don't do that. I need it.

00:23.920 --> 00:25.240
OK.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.320
OK.

00:34.320 --> 00:35.440
OK, good job.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.680
Get Walsh to wash you down.
I can stay if I'm needed, sir.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.440
No, no, no. It's fine. Get washed
down and get out of here.

00:40.440 --> 00:41.760
Come on, arms up.

00:41.760 --> 00:43.640
Might sting a wee bit.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.040
Oh, my God, help!

00:51.040 --> 00:53.040
Help, please!

00:55.120 --> 00:56.560
I'll clean up here.

00:56.560 --> 00:59.720
You go get a hazmat suit and
go and fix our comms wire.

00:59.720 --> 01:01.480
Thank you, sir.

01:01.480 --> 01:02.600
I won't let you down.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.320
Yeah, I don't doubt it.

01:04.320 --> 01:06.200
Best man for the job.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.280
Go on, then.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.880
Help! Ah, ah...

01:15.120 --> 01:17.920
Aargh! Help!

01:21.040 --> 01:22.800
Help!

01:30.960 --> 01:34.440
Fuel To Fire
by Agnes Obel

01:34.440 --> 01:36.360
# Do you want me on your mind?

01:36.360 --> 01:41.160
# Or do you want me to go on?

01:44.560 --> 01:50.560
# I might be yours
as sure as I can say

01:50.560 --> 01:54.400
# Be gone be faraway

01:57.320 --> 02:02.520
# Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

02:05.440 --> 02:10.880
# Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh ooh. #

02:22.400 --> 02:24.440
Sir, they're using sonobuoys
to find us.

02:24.440 --> 02:26.320
More and more are being laid
all the time,

02:26.320 --> 02:28.320
both in front of us and behind us.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.760
They've tried to disable us.

02:32.760 --> 02:35.240
Now they're hunting us.

02:35.240 --> 02:39.480
And we have no intel and no orders
until that comms wire is fixed.

03:22.400 --> 03:23.720
Where's DCI Silva?

03:23.720 --> 03:25.560
Er, she's getting cleaned-up.

03:25.560 --> 03:30.080
Sir, engineer's asking permission to
commence the decontamination?

03:30.080 --> 03:31.800
Tell them to go ahead.

03:36.480 --> 03:40.520
Commencing bleach decontamination of
the missile compartment, all levels.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.560
There's no guarantee it'll work,
sir,

03:46.560 --> 03:48.400
so we'll need to limit access.

03:48.400 --> 03:52.160
EBS masks and a limited exposure
time for anyone who has to go in.

03:52.160 --> 03:54.880
Yes, sir. The coxswain requires
specialist treatment.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.360
He's deteriorating.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.880
Look at those screens.

04:05.880 --> 04:09.880
We still can't send or receive
messages, but even if we could,

04:09.880 --> 04:12.360
we can't signal for
a Casualty Evacuation.

04:12.360 --> 04:16.360
Not until we have a handle on
the tactical situation.

04:16.360 --> 04:19.200
If we don't get him
the drugs he needs,

04:19.200 --> 04:21.000
I don't think he'll survive.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.160
Understood.

04:25.400 --> 04:26.960
I'm sorry.

05:15.160 --> 05:16.640
What are you doing?

05:16.640 --> 05:18.800
It sounded like he was choking.
Out, out!

05:18.800 --> 05:20.240
It's all right.

05:20.240 --> 05:21.520
I've got you.

05:21.520 --> 05:22.640
OK...

05:26.520 --> 05:29.480
Sir, my eyes were playing up
and so I came to get checked.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.840
Right. Well, there's obviously
nothing we can do now,

05:31.840 --> 05:34.120
so get back on watch
and do the best you can.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.480
Aye, sir.

05:35.480 --> 05:36.840
That's it, nice and easy.

06:43.000 --> 06:46.560
Ben Oakley, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of conspiracy

06:46.560 --> 06:48.440
to murder Jade Antoniak.

06:48.440 --> 06:49.960
You are not obliged to say anything,

06:49.960 --> 06:53.160
but anything you do say will be
noted and may be used in evidence.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.560
Do you understand?

06:58.720 --> 07:02.480
This is you with the GRU officer

07:02.480 --> 07:04.680
known as Peter Ingles.

07:05.640 --> 07:07.920
I don't deny knowing him.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.520
What was your relationship with him?

07:10.520 --> 07:14.400
I'll talk to anyone
who's opposed to nuclear weapons.

07:14.400 --> 07:18.480
He said he wanted Russia
to de-militarise.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.760
Russia can't do that
unless we let go of Trident.

07:21.760 --> 07:25.320
He helped out with some things
that were useful to our operations.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.680
I suggested a few people
he could talk to.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.480
That is it.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.240
You have a photo
on your phone of Ingles

07:32.240 --> 07:34.360
and a member of the Royal Navy.

07:34.360 --> 07:37.120
I'd like you to give us your PIN
so that we can take a look at it.

07:37.120 --> 07:40.320
You've arrested me for something
I didn't do.

07:40.320 --> 07:42.680
And that picture is
private property.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.320
When did you take this photo?

07:47.320 --> 07:48.960
A while ago.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.080
Weeks ago.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.440
Weeks ago? That is odd.

07:53.400 --> 07:57.560
Because this is Jade taking
that exact photograph.

07:59.560 --> 08:03.440
You took a copy of that photo
and then deleted it from her laptop.

08:03.440 --> 08:06.120
Digital forensics are working
on that laptop right now

08:06.120 --> 08:08.280
and they'll be able to
get your phone open.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.840
I need to see that photo you stole.

08:09.840 --> 08:11.040
Now.

08:11.040 --> 08:14.440
I need to be clear with you
about...what happened.

08:14.440 --> 08:16.440
What is your PIN?

08:23.480 --> 08:25.120
4547.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.080
Oh, my God.

08:43.040 --> 08:44.200
Branning.

08:44.200 --> 08:45.560
It's Burke's replacement,

08:45.560 --> 08:47.000
the guy who flew out with Amy.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.240
He's the one who's been
working with Ingles.

08:50.640 --> 08:52.640
Sir?

08:52.640 --> 08:55.280
The police have a name
for the Russian operative.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.720
It's the sonar operator,
Matthew Doward.

09:34.160 --> 09:35.600
I love you.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.640
I'm going be with you...

09:46.080 --> 09:48.040
..for the whole of your life.

09:58.080 --> 09:59.960
I... Mm-hm.

10:09.840 --> 10:11.480
You can't even say it, can you?

10:26.440 --> 10:28.040
Oh...

10:42.480 --> 10:44.080
Come on.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.120
Sir?

10:55.640 --> 10:57.640
I'm picking up banging in the boat.

10:57.640 --> 10:58.800
Banging?

11:03.880 --> 11:05.240
What is...?

11:06.920 --> 11:08.320
Well, that's Morse code.

11:08.320 --> 11:11.040
Where's it coming from?
Somewhere near the bow.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.280
Hey, come on...

11:18.280 --> 11:20.480
Oh, fucking come on!

11:23.960 --> 11:25.160
I can't make it out.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.520
You said it's coming from the bow.
Can you narrow it down?

11:27.520 --> 11:29.440
It's marking stronger
in the lower decks, sir.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.920
Maybe the fore-ends.

11:32.880 --> 11:34.600
All right. I'll go check.

11:37.640 --> 11:39.200
What was that?

11:39.200 --> 11:40.800
Banging.

11:47.760 --> 11:49.920
Sir, may I go off watch?

11:49.920 --> 11:51.600
I'm really not feeling good.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.760
You'll have to wait
until your shift's over.

11:53.760 --> 11:54.960
I'm going to be sick.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.480
OK, Christ... Get out of here.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.840
Sir, the ballast hull valve's open.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.160
High level bilge warnings
from AMS 1, sir..

12:57.160 --> 12:59.040
Ballast hull valve AMS 1 open.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.520
Ship Control, emergency stations.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.080
That's more than a tonne of water
a second coming onto the boat.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.680
How does that end up open?

13:04.680 --> 13:06.720
It's sabotage.

13:06.720 --> 13:08.560
Put guards on all essential systems.

13:08.560 --> 13:09.720
Aye, sir.

13:11.080 --> 13:13.000
Shut bulkhead doors.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.560
Emergency stations,
emergency stations...

13:16.560 --> 13:19.240
Ballast hull valve open AMS 1.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.680
Make the battle short.

13:20.680 --> 13:22.640
Shut bulkhead doors.

13:24.200 --> 13:27.960
117 bulkhead door shut and locked.

13:27.960 --> 13:29.360
Bulkhead shutdown.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.040
117 bulkhead door shut and locked.

13:31.040 --> 13:32.840
117 bulkhead shutdown.

13:57.240 --> 13:58.920
Shit!

14:01.080 --> 14:02.240
No...

14:06.720 --> 14:08.480
Ah... It won't go.

14:09.480 --> 14:11.480
Shit!

14:11.480 --> 14:12.960
Go, go.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.320
Yeah, the ballast hull valve's
been fouled.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.840
Come on! We can't shut it.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.120
No, no, the tank top's off.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.000
It's buggered!

14:24.000 --> 14:26.240
We can't stop the water
flooding the tanks.

14:29.840 --> 14:32.680
This is Commander Fleming
on board HMS Archer.

14:32.680 --> 14:35.280
We've picked up a sound that
may be Vigil in distress.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.560
We have the file ready, sir.

14:46.240 --> 14:47.640
What is that?

14:47.640 --> 14:48.840
It's still being analysed,

14:48.840 --> 14:51.360
but it's below the surface
and it's ongoing.

14:51.360 --> 14:54.640
Five Russian ships have changed
course towards that sound.

14:54.640 --> 14:58.480
If they maintain course,
they'll converge around here.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.240
Carry on.
What else have we got in the area?

15:01.240 --> 15:03.120
The Russians are a lot closer.

15:04.160 --> 15:07.240
Our nearest Type 23 is
30 minutes behind.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.240
What's this?

15:10.240 --> 15:12.160
That's the USS Delaware.

15:14.240 --> 15:17.040
This is an attack on us,
and as our long-standing ally

15:17.040 --> 15:19.400
and under the terms of
the NATO agreement,

15:19.400 --> 15:21.200
I'm requesting your assistance.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.640
To do what?

15:22.640 --> 15:24.480
Delaware's in the area.

15:24.480 --> 15:28.080
Flood them with active sonar
and open the bow-caps.

15:28.080 --> 15:31.680
And how do you think they'll respond
to the Delaware getting ready

15:31.680 --> 15:33.320
to fire torpedoes?

15:34.560 --> 15:37.040
I'm hoping
they'll shit their uniforms.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.000
They believe they're unopposed.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.320
It's our job to change
that perception.

15:43.320 --> 15:44.760
I'll talk to my people.

15:44.760 --> 15:45.920
Thank you.

15:52.360 --> 15:55.120
Sir, we're getting really heavy.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.600
What's our depth now?

15:56.600 --> 15:59.880
200 metres. That's the weight of
the water we're taking on.

15:59.880 --> 16:01.360
Hadlow, what are we looking at?

16:01.360 --> 16:03.240
Valve fully open at 200m depth,

16:03.240 --> 16:05.480
so the water pressure's
about 20 bar.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.120
Unlock the emergency blows.

16:07.120 --> 16:10.440
Sir, I think we've got less
than ten minutes.

16:10.440 --> 16:13.040
After that we'll be too heavy to get
back up, no matter what we do.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.480
Understood.

16:36.920 --> 16:38.160
You're not listening to me!

16:38.160 --> 16:40.200
I loved you.
And I wanted to know you,

16:40.200 --> 16:42.120
and you don't even like that
about me.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.040
Kirsten...

16:50.040 --> 16:51.600
I'm sorry.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.560
Don't go.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.560
Christ!

17:57.240 --> 17:58.440
Oh...

18:01.640 --> 18:02.840
OK.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.520
OK, come on.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.320
Doward...

18:15.320 --> 18:17.000
He's the reason Burke was killed.

18:18.160 --> 18:19.600
To get Doward on the boat.

18:21.120 --> 18:22.440
Christ...

18:22.440 --> 18:23.800
Where's Glover?

18:23.800 --> 18:25.240
He's unconscious.

18:25.240 --> 18:27.440
Can you stand up? Stand up.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.480
Doward will go after him.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.640
Y-you need to tell them,
you need to tell them.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.760
Ship Control, this is Pre...

18:39.760 --> 18:41.480
Their fucking line's dead.

18:41.480 --> 18:43.920
Right, come on. We have to go
through the missile deck.

18:43.920 --> 18:45.200
Come on. On me.

18:45.200 --> 18:46.400
Let's go.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.640
Come on. Let's keep going.
Let's keep going.

18:48.640 --> 18:49.840
Come on.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.120
This area's out of bounds, sir.
You know that.

18:58.840 --> 19:00.480
Doward, I've already reported you.

19:00.480 --> 19:03.240
No, you haven't. I cut the wiring.

19:03.240 --> 19:04.800
What's the point?

19:04.800 --> 19:06.920
You've sunk the boat.
You've killed us all.

19:06.920 --> 19:11.040
Newsome's going to surface this boat
and we're all going to evacuate.

19:11.040 --> 19:14.120
Well, some of us are.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.960
I need you to run now.
You've got to tell them.

19:18.680 --> 19:20.520
Fucking...!

19:27.160 --> 19:29.840
Run! Run now!

19:47.280 --> 19:49.120
Go!

20:55.480 --> 20:57.680
Where is the XO?

20:57.680 --> 21:00.760
Depth? 350 metres.

21:03.400 --> 21:05.200
What if we run the hover?

21:05.200 --> 21:08.320
If we can get it online, it'll help
pump out water, slow our descent?

21:08.320 --> 21:11.000
It's not designed for
anything deeper than 150 metres.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.480
I know, but we do not have
another option.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.440
We are taking on water
in tonnes per second

21:15.440 --> 21:19.960
and pumping it out at tonnes per
minute. We're going to the bottom.

21:19.960 --> 21:21.960
Anderton, initiate the hover.

21:24.280 --> 21:25.880
Hover initiated, sir.

22:19.680 --> 22:22.560
You can't hide in here forever.

22:22.560 --> 22:24.280
That bleach will burn your lungs.

22:49.440 --> 22:52.560
We need to get the spanner
out of that valve!

22:52.560 --> 22:54.480
The bastard's stuck hard!

22:55.520 --> 22:58.560
Ah, open the valve! Full open.

22:58.560 --> 23:01.040
Are you fucking mad?!
Come on, we need to get it loose!

23:01.040 --> 23:03.080
If it gets stuck open,
we'll sink this boat!

23:03.080 --> 23:05.320
Open that fucking valve!

23:26.400 --> 23:28.080
Ship Control.

23:28.080 --> 23:30.520
Ship Control, Walsh here.

23:30.520 --> 23:33.280
Yeah, yeah, comms wire streaming.
Reception starting to come in.

23:33.280 --> 23:34.440
Roger.

23:35.600 --> 23:37.440
The forward bilge tanks
are nearly full.

23:37.440 --> 23:39.600
I need to get that hull valve shut.

23:39.600 --> 23:42.480
Sir, communications fully restored!

23:42.480 --> 23:45.080
We're to contact base immediately,
sir. They advise caution -

23:45.080 --> 23:47.200
a lot of Russian units
closing in on our position.

23:47.200 --> 23:48.720
We can't bloody get back up!

23:48.720 --> 23:51.520
Sir, they're saying
Doward is a Russian spy.

23:59.240 --> 24:01.080
Attention, all stations.

24:01.080 --> 24:04.200
Sonar operator Matthew Doward
is a traitor.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.200
He has sabotaged Vigil.

24:06.200 --> 24:09.240
Apprehend him if you can.
Kill him if you can't. But find him.

25:28.520 --> 25:32.200
Everyone knows what you've done.
Leave her alone!

25:32.200 --> 25:34.320
Shut up. I'll slit her throat.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.040
I'll kill you for this.

25:39.040 --> 25:41.040
Control room, now.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.200
Move now!

25:54.040 --> 25:57.440
Fucking come on!
It's coming, it's coming.

25:57.440 --> 26:00.080
Yeah, got it! The valve, shut it!

26:04.720 --> 26:05.800
Come on!

26:12.560 --> 26:15.680
Get in!

26:19.360 --> 26:22.080
Sir, ballast hull valve is shut.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.920
Sir, we're still dropping.
The hover won't take much more.

26:24.920 --> 26:26.280
They can't cool it fast enough.

26:26.280 --> 26:29.880
We have to give it more time
to pump more water out.

26:29.880 --> 26:33.200
Full ahead. Then on my mark,
full rise on the fore planes,

26:33.200 --> 26:37.080
full rise on the after planes.
Wait for my mark. Full ahead, sir.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.040
Keep your distance.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.440
Sir, the hover motor is smoking.
Keep it running.

26:49.440 --> 26:52.160
Depth? 540 metres.

26:52.160 --> 26:54.400
Ten more metres
and we'll hit crush depth.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.080
 Captain...

26:56.080 --> 26:58.280
..the chain of command is changing.

26:58.280 --> 27:01.520
I'm going to give you instructions,
and you're going to execute them

27:01.520 --> 27:04.520
without arguing, or I will slit
this woman's throat.

27:04.520 --> 27:06.680
You understand?

27:06.680 --> 27:08.080
We are going to surface

27:08.080 --> 27:11.600
and make contact with
one of the Russian vessels.

27:11.600 --> 27:14.160
Emergency surface
this submarine now.

27:14.160 --> 27:16.600
Is that an order?
Don't fuck around with me!

27:16.600 --> 27:20.200
Sir, we are still dropping.
545 metres.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.600
All right.

27:25.720 --> 27:28.640
Team, on my mark, execute my orders.

27:33.400 --> 27:34.440
Mark.

27:48.440 --> 27:51.360
Ship Control, do not surface
the submarine.

27:51.360 --> 27:54.600
Come to periscope depth. I will not
give them the satisfaction.

27:54.600 --> 27:57.160
Matthew Doward, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of the murder

27:57.160 --> 28:00.080
of Lieutenant Commander Prentice.
You're not obliged to say anything,

28:00.080 --> 28:04.440
but anything you do say may be noted
and used in evidence.

28:04.440 --> 28:05.760
Do you understand?

28:22.400 --> 28:25.640
Plot their course
over the last hour.

28:35.240 --> 28:38.440
That's where the Delaware
opened her bow caps.

28:38.440 --> 28:40.680
And in response, all
the Russian units have dispersed

28:40.680 --> 28:42.320
from their original positions.

28:46.560 --> 28:49.000
Any more flooding noise? No, sir.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.360
Nothing more.

28:52.880 --> 28:54.680
Well done, everyone.

28:54.680 --> 28:56.320
Get this intel to Vigil.

28:58.080 --> 29:00.680
And if she signals home, I want her
100 miles from anyone

29:00.680 --> 29:01.720
when she does it.

29:05.960 --> 29:09.080
I didn't go through Jade's laptop.

29:09.080 --> 29:12.040
She came to me with the photo.
I recognised Peter.

29:13.280 --> 29:15.440
Did she say why she took it?

29:15.440 --> 29:18.120
Well, she'd seen him
around Dunloch before.

29:18.120 --> 29:19.600
She was convinced he was MI5

29:19.600 --> 29:22.640
and she wanted to make a big story
out of it in the press.

29:22.640 --> 29:25.600
So you told Peter about it
before she could?

29:25.600 --> 29:26.840
No, I...

29:26.840 --> 29:29.520
I told Peter to be more careful
in future, that's all.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.400
I thought that was the end of it.

29:33.640 --> 29:36.040
But then you arranged for them
to meet.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.600
He asked to meet her.

29:38.880 --> 29:41.360
He said he wanted to work with her
like we did,

29:41.360 --> 29:44.520
and that he could tell her
what really happened to Craig Burke.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.640
So what happened at this meeting?

29:55.680 --> 29:57.760
We met at the place
that was arranged.

30:00.160 --> 30:02.160
He was supposed to talk to her...

30:04.600 --> 30:07.000
..but he grabbed her,

30:07.000 --> 30:08.400
dragged her into the water.

30:10.240 --> 30:12.320
I didn't understand
what was happening.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.080
Then he started drowning her.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.800
I just...

30:17.800 --> 30:20.640
I had no idea he was going to do
anything like that.

30:20.640 --> 30:22.240
I ran over.

30:22.240 --> 30:24.280
I would have tried to stop him.

30:26.280 --> 30:27.520
But it was too late.

30:29.440 --> 30:31.640
Did you take her out of the water?

30:33.760 --> 30:35.480
Did you try mouth-to-mouth?

30:37.880 --> 30:39.240
Did you call an ambulance?

30:40.240 --> 30:41.280
I wanted to.

30:44.200 --> 30:46.400
He'd made it look like I was
his accomplice.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.640
You can see that, can't you?

30:51.120 --> 30:53.120
You could have talked to us.

30:54.160 --> 30:56.080
Jade wanted that photograph
out there,

30:56.080 --> 30:58.120
to get rid of the deterrent.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.360
You would have covered it up.

31:00.360 --> 31:03.160
I thought if I could at least do
that... You tried to claim asylum

31:03.160 --> 31:06.120
so that we wouldn't be able
to arrest you for Jade's murder.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.960
You just ran.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.640
So don't play the hero with me.

31:11.640 --> 31:13.800
I tried to do the right thing.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.240
She trusted you...

31:16.800 --> 31:19.960
..and then you sold her out to a man
who you knew to be a Russian spy,

31:19.960 --> 31:22.320
and then you helped them
cover up her murder.

31:25.280 --> 31:29.320
You're going to go to prison
for that for a long time.

31:39.880 --> 31:41.480
Come on.

31:47.480 --> 31:49.840
Hey. Hey!

31:53.840 --> 31:55.640
Hey, it's all good.

31:56.880 --> 31:58.680
They arrested Doward.

31:58.680 --> 32:00.080
The boat's safe.

32:02.400 --> 32:03.640
You're going to be OK.

32:54.680 --> 32:56.560
If he hadn't have heard me
in there...

32:58.560 --> 32:59.600
..I'd have died.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.320
He did his job.

33:05.840 --> 33:06.960
He did it well.

33:08.960 --> 33:10.600
He'd have known that.

33:14.360 --> 33:15.840
What will your report cover?

33:18.720 --> 33:22.080
I'll report my findings
on Jackie, Burke and Doward.

33:22.080 --> 33:24.320
I'll give the Crown Office
the evidence they need

33:24.320 --> 33:25.560
to make their case.

33:27.120 --> 33:28.160
And that's it.

33:29.440 --> 33:32.600
Sir, five minutes
till the helicopter arrives.

33:49.240 --> 33:51.280
Sir, we've treated DCI Silva.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.760
And she'll be monitored
until she's released.

33:53.760 --> 33:56.080
We have stocked up on
atropine and pralidoxime

33:56.080 --> 33:58.120
in case anybody else gets exposed.

33:58.120 --> 34:00.400
Adams is stable,
not likely to get worse.

34:00.400 --> 34:03.400
And Hadlow, Walsh and Kierly, we've
treated for nerve agent exposure,

34:03.400 --> 34:05.880
but they're refusing medevac.

34:05.880 --> 34:08.280
But Vanquish takes over our patrol
in three days.

34:08.280 --> 34:13.080
We can run on a reduced crew.
Sir, with respect, I want to stay.

34:13.080 --> 34:14.760
Me too, sir.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.600
Me too. I'll see it through.

34:21.520 --> 34:23.960
Lieutenant Surgeon,
I shall defer to your judgment.

34:23.960 --> 34:26.760
Well, it's a risk,
but it's only a risk to them.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.160
Carry on, then.

34:42.640 --> 34:45.520
Godspeed, my friend. I'll see you
when we get alongside.

34:46.800 --> 34:47.840
Carry on.

35:24.920 --> 35:25.960
Thank you.

35:27.880 --> 35:30.560
I speak on behalf
of the entire ship's company.

35:33.040 --> 35:34.280
Good luck.

35:54.200 --> 35:56.240
 Suspect Matthew Doward
is detained

35:56.240 --> 35:58.680
and requires secure transportation.

35:58.680 --> 36:01.920
Warrant Officer Elliott Glover
needs urgent medical assistance

36:01.920 --> 36:03.920
for nerve gas inhalation.

36:03.920 --> 36:07.720
DCI Amy Silva to be taken
for precautionary assessment.

37:57.120 --> 37:58.160
Welcome home.

38:00.680 --> 38:01.720
Thanks.

38:03.040 --> 38:07.600
Hey, welcome back! How are you?

38:07.600 --> 38:09.960
Good. Erm...

38:09.960 --> 38:11.920
I just want some answers.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.120
MI5 are in. They got your report.

38:14.120 --> 38:16.160
They're ready to have a crack
at Doward.

38:16.160 --> 38:18.040
Do you want to take a look?
Yeah, please.

38:18.040 --> 38:21.080
Maybe you should rest.
No, I really want to see this.

38:21.080 --> 38:22.560
Shall we go through?

38:24.160 --> 38:25.200
Yeah, sure.

38:28.840 --> 38:30.480
Matthew Doward, you are here

38:30.480 --> 38:34.920
because we want answers about the
actions you took on board HMS Vigil.

38:34.920 --> 38:39.640
We have more than enough evidence to
convict from DCI Silva's report...

38:39.640 --> 38:41.080
Are you all right?

38:41.080 --> 38:43.640
..but we'd like your account
of what happened.

38:46.440 --> 38:49.160
What do I get if I help you?

38:49.160 --> 38:50.680
We can talk to the judge

38:50.680 --> 38:53.800
and request a lighter sentence
for your co-operation.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.240
We can put you
somewhere comfortable,

38:57.240 --> 39:00.640
or we can put you in a cage
where you shit in a bucket.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.480
So...

39:06.720 --> 39:07.760
..Jackie Hamilton?

39:17.280 --> 39:19.120
I was told what Jackie
was going to do

39:19.120 --> 39:21.200
in exchange for them
getting her son out.

39:21.200 --> 39:23.040
And the reason that Burke was killed

39:23.040 --> 39:25.960
was because he had the same job
as you?

39:30.840 --> 39:35.880
There's a guy at the Peace Camp -
some old-school CND type.

39:36.960 --> 39:40.080
He told the Russians
to approach Burke.

39:40.080 --> 39:42.440
They went ahead, made an approach...

39:43.920 --> 39:44.960
..but Burke...

39:47.040 --> 39:48.360
..turned them down flat.

39:50.240 --> 39:55.440
So now you've got Burke,
this mouthy wee guy,

39:55.440 --> 39:59.640
knowing crews are being approached
and knowing who Peter Ingles is.

39:59.640 --> 40:02.760
Are you saying that's why
they chose to kill Burke?

40:02.760 --> 40:05.440
It had to be one of
the sonar operators, didn't it,

40:05.440 --> 40:07.080
to get you on board?

40:07.080 --> 40:09.760
But this way, they're getting rid
of someone

40:09.760 --> 40:11.520
who could identify Ingles as well.

40:12.840 --> 40:14.720
You'd have to ask THEM that.

40:14.720 --> 40:18.160
What was the plan
behind the nerve agent?

40:21.160 --> 40:24.000
Jackie Hamilton released
the nerve agent.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.880
She set it off accidentally.

40:25.880 --> 40:28.800
We know that from
DCI Silva's report.

40:28.800 --> 40:33.120
You had threatened her when she
didn't deliver it as you'd ordered.

40:33.120 --> 40:35.400
She opened it
because she didn't trust you

40:35.400 --> 40:38.320
and she wanted to protect the crew.

40:38.320 --> 40:41.840
Your job was to force an evacuation
of the submarine,

40:41.840 --> 40:44.040
with Russian boats standing by
to meet you.

40:47.280 --> 40:49.920
What were you told
would happen next?

40:49.920 --> 40:51.080
Nothing.

40:52.320 --> 40:55.160
A few photographs
and the offer of a tow home.

40:55.160 --> 40:57.360
What?! So he's just...?

40:58.880 --> 41:01.640
He's saying it was just a PR stunt.

41:01.640 --> 41:04.200
We think Russia's aim was
to make the deterrent look bad.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.040
There's a vote coming up
on its funding,

41:06.040 --> 41:08.200
and if questions
were raised about it...

41:08.200 --> 41:09.840
People were killed for that?! No.

41:09.840 --> 41:11.800
But a lot of MPs want Trident gone

41:11.800 --> 41:14.440
but don't want to look soft
on defence. And this...

41:14.440 --> 41:17.120
This would have given them an excuse
to vote against it.

41:17.120 --> 41:19.760
Russia dupes Britain
into scrapping its deterrent -

41:19.760 --> 41:21.840
that's modern warfare.

41:21.840 --> 41:25.280
You seem...relaxed,
given your situation.

41:25.280 --> 41:27.400
I think we all know
how these things work -

41:27.400 --> 41:29.760
one of them for one of me.

41:29.760 --> 41:32.920
And you're confident
Russia want you?

41:36.160 --> 41:38.200
You don't want a trial.

41:39.960 --> 41:41.560
Me giving evidence...

41:42.960 --> 41:45.760
..that's your worst nightmare.
Well, it'll be a closed trial.

41:45.760 --> 41:47.680
And after that, you'll be
kept in isolation -

41:47.680 --> 41:52.600
no visitors, no phone calls,
just you becoming an old man.

41:56.840 --> 41:59.880
We're not going to tell the Russians
that we've got you.

41:59.880 --> 42:03.000
And they're hardly going to come
asking for you, are they?

42:05.480 --> 42:06.720
So, if you think about it...

42:08.080 --> 42:09.720
..you don't really exist.

42:11.760 --> 42:14.280
Why did you decide to work
for Russia?

42:25.440 --> 42:26.480
No comment.

42:28.160 --> 42:29.480
He's a narcissist.

42:31.880 --> 42:34.000
It made him feel special.
Gave him power.

42:35.240 --> 42:36.640
That's all I need to see.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.960
Do you want me to drive you home?
I can take you.

42:41.960 --> 42:43.720
No. I want to see Poppy.

42:44.760 --> 42:47.000
She's missed you.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.440
What?

42:48.440 --> 42:51.440
I dropped her off a present.
It was on your calendar.

42:55.720 --> 42:56.920
Come with me.

42:58.440 --> 42:59.640
To see Poppy?

43:03.880 --> 43:05.000
OK.

43:42.480 --> 43:45.400
What are you going to say
to the press?

43:45.400 --> 43:47.920
You're going to have a hard time
getting MPs to sign off

43:47.920 --> 43:50.040
on new warheads with THIS story
breaking.

43:50.040 --> 43:52.040
I just don't think
they'll vote for it.

43:52.040 --> 43:54.160
Well, that's certainly what
Russia will be hoping.

43:54.160 --> 43:55.600
Are you going to help them?

43:55.600 --> 43:57.880
The Russians tried to bury
this photo.

43:57.880 --> 44:00.360
People were killed to try
and stop this story from coming out.

44:00.360 --> 44:02.440
This was when they had an operative
in the field.

44:02.440 --> 44:04.720
The story's over now.
He's been arrested.

44:04.720 --> 44:07.880
Now a victory for Russia
would be you telling the world

44:07.880 --> 44:09.920
that they managed to get a spy
onboard Vigil.

44:09.920 --> 44:11.840
Which they did! Which they did.

44:13.160 --> 44:16.480
So your argument amounts to, "Please
let the Navy get away with this"?

44:16.480 --> 44:18.960
It's not just about protecting
the Navy, is it?

44:18.960 --> 44:20.520
It's about protecting Britain.

44:20.520 --> 44:22.840
And how exactly does the deterrent
achieve that?

44:22.840 --> 44:24.880
The Cold War is over.

44:24.880 --> 44:27.440
Admiral, there are better ways
to exert our influence

44:27.440 --> 44:29.440
in the world than
the threat of mutual distrust.

44:29.440 --> 44:32.000
Yes, so says China,
so says Russia, so says France.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
We all agree. Everyone agrees.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.120
But no-one moves till we all move.

44:38.080 --> 44:41.080
All the more reason for us
to set an example.

44:41.080 --> 44:43.320
And we should start by owning up
to what happened

44:43.320 --> 44:45.760
to the five Scottish trawlermen
who drowned.

44:45.760 --> 44:48.400
Their families deserve some closure.

44:50.560 --> 44:52.920
Or are you going to blame that
on Russia as well?

44:55.760 --> 44:57.400
 Of course you will.

44:58.680 --> 45:01.560
I think I need to remind you
of your own actions.

45:01.560 --> 45:04.760
You had photographic evidence
that there was a Russian spy

45:04.760 --> 45:07.640
on board a British
Vanguard Class Submarine...

45:07.640 --> 45:09.280
We had no idea that man
was on Vigil.

45:09.280 --> 45:11.920
..which you choose to hang onto
for political gain

45:11.920 --> 45:14.080
rather than hand it over
to the security services.

45:14.080 --> 45:15.640
Because you would have
covered it up,

45:15.640 --> 45:18.160
just like you did at Port Havers!

45:18.160 --> 45:20.560
We intended to publish
then go straight to the police.

45:20.560 --> 45:23.320
You're talking a matter of hours.
So you say. It doesn't play well,

45:23.320 --> 45:25.680
though, does it? And in this game,
every second counts.

45:25.680 --> 45:27.360
Minutes before that man
was arrested,

45:27.360 --> 45:29.280
he killed one of my officers.

45:29.280 --> 45:31.520
How do you feel about that story
getting out?

45:39.080 --> 45:41.480
I'd like to get this matter
wrapped up today if possible.

45:41.480 --> 45:44.760
I don't see how this benefits anyone
except Russia. But it's up to you.

45:48.240 --> 45:50.360
We'll keep it from the press
this time.

45:52.520 --> 45:55.000
WOMAN: They're ready for you, sir.

45:59.640 --> 46:02.840
We will get nuclear weapons
out of Scotland within my lifetime.

46:05.120 --> 46:06.880
I don't doubt your commitment.

46:18.440 --> 46:21.200
Amy, when I was last here,
Morag and Gordon,

46:21.200 --> 46:24.560
they mentioned the conversations
you've been having about custody,

46:24.560 --> 46:26.640
and they thought that I knew.

46:26.640 --> 46:29.440
But you don't need to say anything.
It's just...

46:29.440 --> 46:32.400
Well, it's just in case
it comes up. They...

46:32.400 --> 46:34.120
They know we're not together now.

46:39.560 --> 46:42.160
OK, I owe you an explanation...
No, you really don't need to...

46:42.160 --> 46:44.440
No, let me just... I want to.
Just let me try.

46:52.840 --> 46:54.200
I got scared.

46:58.640 --> 46:59.680
Why?

47:02.440 --> 47:03.600
I don't know. I just...

47:08.400 --> 47:11.800
Because when it was you and me,
on our own, that was...

47:14.440 --> 47:16.040
Like, I was really happy.

47:18.320 --> 47:19.600
I was happy too.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.320
It's just when we had to be
out in the world...

47:24.320 --> 47:29.240
No. I know, I know. I mean,
I can see how it changed you.

47:31.520 --> 47:33.680
I could see it happen.

47:33.680 --> 47:35.040
Well, it's like you always said.

47:35.040 --> 47:36.960
I have to put everything
in its own little box,

47:36.960 --> 47:40.920
so I just put Poppy in one
and work in another.

47:40.920 --> 47:44.440
And you... I never wanted just
the parts of you that were easy.

47:44.440 --> 47:46.160
Ever.

47:51.520 --> 47:53.800
I know I hurt you, and I'm sorry.

47:57.400 --> 48:00.040
You did hurt me. I just didn't know
how to bring Poppy into this,

48:00.040 --> 48:02.000
not when I had so many questions.

48:05.520 --> 48:07.080
Well, how do you feel now?

48:13.000 --> 48:16.480
You always made it sound so easy
when you said you loved me. Hm.

48:17.880 --> 48:20.120
Aye, well, I don't think
that should be hard.

48:23.680 --> 48:24.800
I find it hard.

48:27.760 --> 48:30.440
But it doesn't mean
that I don't feel it.

48:35.480 --> 48:37.600
I want us to try.

48:42.160 --> 48:44.560
I don't want to go back
to the way things were.

48:44.560 --> 48:46.240
I know... No, I really don't.

48:46.240 --> 48:49.280
I mean, what if you wake up
in 12 months' time

48:49.280 --> 48:51.280
and you're back where you started?

48:51.280 --> 48:53.160
I don't want that to happen.

48:58.640 --> 49:01.120
You know, when I was down there
and I was trapped...

49:03.200 --> 49:05.880
..like, all I could think about
was Poppy...

49:07.800 --> 49:08.960
..and you.

49:15.080 --> 49:16.840
Do you love me?

49:20.000 --> 49:21.400
Yeah.

49:28.400 --> 49:29.440
I love you.

49:32.560 --> 49:36.360
Earlier this month, a Scottish
fishing trawler, the Mhairi Finnea,

49:36.360 --> 49:39.400
went down south of Barra Head,
on the west coast of Scotland.

49:40.440 --> 49:41.880
On examination of the wreck,

49:41.880 --> 49:46.320
we found strong evidence that the
Mhairi Finnea had been dragged down

49:46.320 --> 49:51.280
by a Russian submarine
that snagged her nets.

49:51.280 --> 49:53.840
This submarine was
operating illegally

49:53.840 --> 49:56.800
inside British territorial waters.

49:56.800 --> 49:59.720
We believe the sinking
was probably an accident.

49:59.720 --> 50:06.560
However, this is evidence
of Russian aggression

50:06.560 --> 50:09.680
and Russian incompetence.

50:11.360 --> 50:15.800
I think today has to be
a wake-up call for a lot of people.

50:15.800 --> 50:20.920
We have in this country to be ready
for a new kind of peacekeeping,

50:20.920 --> 50:23.440
on the battlefields of tomorrow,

50:23.440 --> 50:27.680
which will be under the surface
of the sea.

50:27.680 --> 50:30.080
Parliament will shortly be
voting on...

50:51.480 --> 50:52.520
Jade...

50:53.520 --> 50:55.640
..I don't want this world to burn.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.080
And I know you don't want that
either.

51:01.200 --> 51:02.480
I want it safe...

51:04.480 --> 51:06.360
..so we can be in it together.

51:14.520 --> 51:16.520
 I got up
early today.

51:17.840 --> 51:19.360
It was still dark, but...

51:20.520 --> 51:22.240
I went down by the side of the loch.

51:27.440 --> 51:29.000
Mum?

51:32.800 --> 51:37.640
I saw the sun come up over the sea
and birds out flying...

51:48.200 --> 51:50.680
..and I thought of how beautiful
this world is...

51:57.720 --> 52:00.600
..and how much I miss
when I'm under the water.

52:09.320 --> 52:14.000
Hey! Hi! Mummy! Hi, darling! Hi!

52:15.240 --> 52:16.360
How are you?

52:17.880 --> 52:22.800
Are you OK? I missed you.
I missed you. I missed you.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.880
 And then I thought of you.
