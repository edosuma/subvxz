So let's all get together and welcome
him to the stage with a great big hand.

00:40.207 --> 00:42.377

01:29.017 --> 01:32.146
I believe we're gonna have
a goodtime tonight

01:33.398 --> 01:37.111
It's good to have somebody

01:37.194 --> 01:39.280
Right now

01:39.363 --> 01:40.740

01:41.616 --> 01:44.995

01:45.079 --> 01:47.665
To twist the night away

01:47.749 --> 01:50.085
- Lord have mercy.
- What you running from, son?

01:52.797 --> 01:54.382
We got a call.

02:00.431 --> 02:03.894
Don't fight the feelin'

02:05.187 --> 02:08.691
Got to feel the feelin' now
Got to feel the feelin'

02:09.776 --> 02:13.280
'Cause it make you groove right
when you feel the feelin'

02:13.364 --> 02:16.618
Oh, make me want you now

02:16.659 --> 02:19.037
Got to feel the feelin'

02:19.121 --> 02:23.835
'Cause it make you groove right
when you feel the feelin'

02:23.918 --> 02:28.507
Make me want ya
when I got the feelin; baby

02:28.591 --> 02:30.802
So don't fight it

02:30.885 --> 02:32.804
No, don? t fight it

02:32.846 --> 02:35.474
Baby, just feel it

03:29.457 --> 03:31.501
I'm gonna bust you up.

03:31.543 --> 03:34.171
Beat your ass
like I was your daddy.

04:15.847 --> 04:18.935
I said I'm beginning
to feel allright now

04:24.942 --> 04:28.947
I feel can tell you
about my baby right now

04:33.077 --> 04:36.122
I said I feel
you're in the mood right now

04:44.841 --> 04:48.346
I said I feel
you're in the mood

04:50.891 --> 04:53.310
Some times me and my baby
we fuss and fight

04:53.394 --> 04:56.314
And my baby leave home
'cause things ain't right

04:56.397 --> 04:58.817
For those of you
who think you came here today...

04:58.859 --> 05:01.612
to hear us tell you
like these Negro leaders do...

05:01.654 --> 05:04.282
that your times
will just get better...

05:04.365 --> 05:09.372
that we shall
overcome someday...

05:09.455 --> 05:12.500
I say to you,
you came to the wrong place.

05:12.584 --> 05:15.880
Because your times will never
get better unless you make them better.

05:17.131 --> 05:20.010
Those of you who think you came here
to hear us tell you...

05:20.051 --> 05:23.681
to turn the other cheek
to the brutality of the white man...

05:23.764 --> 05:27.644
and this system of injustice
that's in place right here in America...

05:27.686 --> 05:30.064
you think you're gonna come here
and hear us tell you...

05:30.147 --> 05:34.152
to go out there and beg
for a place at their lunch counter...

05:34.945 --> 05:38.157
again, I say you came
to the wrong place.

05:38.199 --> 05:42.662
We don't teach you
to turn the other cheek in the South.

05:42.704 --> 05:45.499
And we don't teach you
to turn the other cheek in the North.

05:45.541 --> 05:49.379
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches you to obey the law...

05:49.421 --> 05:52.216
to Cary yourselves
in a respectable way...

05:52.299 --> 05:54.844
in a proud
Afro-American way.

05:55.553 --> 05:58.098
But at the same time,
we teach you...

05:58.182 --> 06:00.518
that anyone puts
their hand on you...

06:02.645 --> 06:07.777
brother, you do your best to see they
don't put their hand on anybody else...

06:07.860 --> 06:09.112
again.

06:13.575 --> 06:14.910
Time.

06:34.309 --> 06:36.270
Just like that, Daddy.

06:36.312 --> 06:38.398
Never jump in one place.
Bad for the heart.

06:38.439 --> 06:40.025
Forwards, backwards, sideways.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.985
That's the most important thing.

06:53.124 --> 06:55.252
I'm called Bundini.

06:55.335 --> 06:58.881
Rhymes with Houdini.
He was a Jew too.

06:58.965 --> 07:02.677
Some people call me Fast Black.
Some call me Daddy Mac.

07:03.804 --> 07:06.516
Gave Sugar Ray Robinson
my power for seven years.

07:06.599 --> 07:09.060
My voodoo. My magic.

07:09.144 --> 07:12.064
Now Shorty done sent me here
to work for you.

07:12.147 --> 07:15.360
- Who's Shorty?
- I call him Shorty.

07:15.443 --> 07:17.613
Call him Shorty
'cause he like 'em circumcised.

07:17.696 --> 07:22.494
Original people. Like Moses.
And I was a babe in a basket too.

07:22.577 --> 07:25.748
Born on a doorstep with a note
across my chest that read...

07:25.831 --> 07:28.876
"You do the best
you can for him, world."

07:28.960 --> 07:30.879
I wanna be your inspiration.

07:30.962 --> 07:33.632
Your motivator in your corner.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.095
Can I be in your corner,
young man?

07:44.521 --> 07:45.939
Time!

07:49.360 --> 07:52.280

Sonny Liston,

09:53.721 --> 09:55.849
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

09:55.932 --> 09:58.936
Oh!
Rumble, young man, rumble.

09:59.019 --> 10:01.773
Y'all wanna lose y' all money?
Then you bet it on Sonny.

10:01.856 --> 10:04.693
He know I'm great.
He will fall in eight.

10:04.776 --> 10:07.530
Come on, you big, ugly bear.
I'll whup you right now.

10:09.240 --> 10:12.619
Two-ten and a half.
Two-ten and a half!

10:12.703 --> 10:16.499
The challenger, Cassius Clay,
two hundred and ten and a half pounds.

10:16.541 --> 10:19.169
- Man, you sure that's right?
- That's what the weight is.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.839
Old, ugly bear, come on.
Let's go.

10:21.922 --> 10:26.386
You got these folks fooled. I ain't
scared of ya! I ain't scared of ya!

10:28.180 --> 10:30.475
Two hundred and eighteen.
Two hundred and eighteen.

10:30.558 --> 10:33.437
Sonny Liston,
the champion of the world.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.814
Two hundred and eighteen pounds.

10:35.898 --> 10:37.942
- Pounds of what?
- Pounds of ugly.

10:38.026 --> 10:40.529
That man's so ugly,
when he sweat...

10:40.612 --> 10:44.408
the sweat run backwards off his forehand
just to stay away from his face.

10:48.914 --> 10:51.626
Come on, you big, ugly bear!
I'll turn you into a rug!

10:51.709 --> 10:54.170
Keep talkin'.
I'm gonna fuck you up.

11:00.720 --> 11:02.138
If you whup me...

11:02.222 --> 11:06.143
I'll crawl out of the ring and take
the first jet airplane out the country.

11:06.227 --> 11:09.356
- Is that a promise, Mr. Clay?
- You'll eat his words first.

11:09.439 --> 11:13.277
- Cassius, you're a 7-1 underdog.
- Liston says he talks with his fists.

11:13.319 --> 11:15.321
- What do you say?
- You scared of him?

11:15.405 --> 11:17.658
I'm gonna give Sonny Liston
talkin' lessons...

11:17.741 --> 11:20.202
boxin' lessons
and fallin' down lessons.

11:20.995 --> 11:24.124
Cassius, are you a black Muslim?
Pat Putnam says in the Miami Herald...

11:24.207 --> 11:26.752
A man's religion is his own business.
What kind of question is that?

11:26.794 --> 11:32.050
- Angelo, tell me...
- Malcolm X was in town, then he left.

11:32.134 --> 11:34.261
Was that so
he wouldn't embarrass you?

11:34.345 --> 11:36.222
- Yeah, Howard?
- Liston doesn't like you.

11:36.305 --> 11:39.142
Really can't stand you.
Says he wants to kill you.

11:39.184 --> 11:41.270
Howard Cosell, you ain't
nothin' but an instigator.

11:41.353 --> 11:44.941
- Man, how you get that way?
- Cassius, now you? re being truculent.

11:45.025 --> 11:46.485
If it's good, I'm that.

11:48.988 --> 11:52.617
You next. Soon as I'm done with Sonny
Liston, I'm fightin' Howard Cosell.

11:52.701 --> 11:54.661
Y'all write that down right now.

12:09.805 --> 12:11.515
That's good?

12:12.558 --> 12:14.144
Wanna check that out?

12:22.529 --> 12:24.865
Hey, man, when you get back?

12:24.907 --> 12:27.702
I just got here.
I'm front row, seat seven.

12:31.749 --> 12:34.419
I'll be sittin'
with Mom and Dad.

12:37.255 --> 12:40.843
You should've stayed in the first place.
Nobody gotta hide when they're with me.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.263
There's nothing wrong
with being cool, my brother.

12:43.346 --> 12:44.264
He's right.

13:31.781 --> 13:34.409
- ...and challenger, Cassius Clay.
- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

13:34.451 --> 13:37.788
Brought to you
by the City Service Oil Company...

13:37.872 --> 13:41.251
and its dealers
in 37 states and Canada...

13:41.292 --> 13:44.713
known to millions of motorists
for Big Gallon gasoline...

13:44.797 --> 13:48.551
and by new Wildroot,
totally new Wildroot in a new tube...

13:48.635 --> 13:53.724
with a great formula that grooms hair
to look neat and natural, never greasy.

13:53.808 --> 13:56.144
Another boxing milestone
is at hand.

13:56.227 --> 14:00.149
In just a few minutes,
Louisville's Cassius Marcellus Clay...

14:00.191 --> 14:02.318
will be facing
the devastating punching power...

14:02.402 --> 14:05.656
of the heavyweight champion,
Charles "Sonny" Liston.

14:05.697 --> 14:09.869
For the heavyweight championship
of the world.

14:12.331 --> 14:14.333
Introducing, on my right...

14:15.293 --> 14:17.295
And now the time has come.

14:17.378 --> 14:21.967
Both challenger and champion
are in the ring.

14:22.009 --> 14:25.472
The heavyweight championship
of the world is on the line.

14:25.555 --> 14:29.351
I fit goes past the first round,
there will be surprises already.

14:30.061 --> 14:33.523
Sonny Liston wrapped in that
tery cloth towel of his...

14:33.607 --> 14:36.277
wrapped around his head
swami fashion...

14:36.360 --> 14:39.197
Looking as malevolent
and baleful as ever.

14:39.239 --> 14:42.618
But this man
is a professional prizefighter.

14:42.701 --> 14:44.745
Make no mistake about it.

14:47.916 --> 14:49.877
I want a clean fight.

14:49.918 --> 14:52.338
When I say break,
stop punching and step back.

14:52.380 --> 14:54.507
Do you have
any questions, champ?

14:54.591 --> 14:56.426
Any questions, challenger?

14:56.510 --> 15:00.264
We're fine.
Touch gloves, gentlemen. Good luck.

15:03.268 --> 15:06.063
Good evening,
sports fans across the nation.

15:06.105 --> 15:08.733
Liston in the white trunks
with the black stripes.

15:08.817 --> 15:12.947
Clay, an inch and a half taller, in
the white trunks with the red stripes...

15:27.047 --> 15:29.843
And Cassius Clay
is sidestepping.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.822
There it is, champ.
Stay on your toes now.

15:54.706 --> 15:58.461
And we can see that the champion
is the aggressor.

15:58.503 --> 16:01.089
There's a shot under the heart.

16:30.083 --> 16:33.504
Cassius Clay slips away.
And now Clay pounds a left.

16:33.588 --> 16:36.591
Another left. A straight jab.

16:40.096 --> 16:42.891
It seems to have stunned him.
And that's the bell.

16:42.974 --> 16:46.395
And they're fighting after the bell.
And they're still fighting.

16:46.478 --> 16:49.065
This round is over.

16:49.148 --> 16:50.942
Break it up, ref.

16:51.026 --> 16:54.113
There is no love lost between
the two contenders at this time.

16:54.196 --> 16:58.034
Cassius goes back to his corner.
It's been an amazing round.

16:58.076 --> 16:59.578
You can beat this guy.

17:02.081 --> 17:04.584
I'm still here.

17:04.666 --> 17:08.047
And Sonny Liston
is not taking the stool.

17:08.088 --> 17:11.134
He's anxious to get back
into the challenger's face.

17:11.217 --> 17:14.137
Take it to the body.
Kill the body, the head will follow.

17:45.217 --> 17:47.512
This is a totally different fight
than Liston expected...

17:47.595 --> 17:49.431
and anyone in this arena
will tell you.

17:49.514 --> 17:53.895
There's a long, looping left hand.
Clay's eyes are wide open now.

18:04.616 --> 18:06.952
- Come on, Cass! Move!
- Step back.

18:08.955 --> 18:11.833
- Come on, Cassius!
- Come on, Chi-Chi!

18:14.879 --> 18:16.547
I'm not prognosticating
anything...

18:16.631 --> 18:18.967
but merely his survival
to this juncture...

18:36.697 --> 18:38.658
Cass, hit him!

18:49.838 --> 18:50.756
Break.

18:52.258 --> 18:54.094
Let him go.

19:22.545 --> 19:26.216
Sonny Liston is hurt.
He's bleeding from his eye.

19:29.178 --> 19:30.513
He's defying the experts early.

19:30.555 --> 19:35.436
We have to take a look at this man and
say he is not in awe of the champion.

20:03.846 --> 20:07.309
He ain't nothin' to me.
And he know it.

20:07.392 --> 20:08.810
This is it now.

20:14.776 --> 20:16.737
Let me have that, John.

20:21.785 --> 20:23.412
And now they're ready.

20:27.625 --> 20:30.170
You gonna knock
the ugly off of him.

20:30.253 --> 20:32.506
That's gonna take a long time,
but you can do it.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.931
There he is. Get him off.
Do your job, ref.

20:39.682 --> 20:42.060
Shake him.
Do your job, ref.

20:46.941 --> 20:49.110
There it is.

20:49.903 --> 20:51.488
Come on, ref.

20:55.368 --> 20:56.369
Break.

21:02.501 --> 21:04.921
- There he is.
- Clay slips around and out.

21:07.966 --> 21:10.636
Up against the ropes.
Right above me now.

21:14.766 --> 21:17.311
Too tight. Get in there.

21:29.493 --> 21:31.787
My eyes. There's something in my eyes.
I can't see nothin'.

21:31.871 --> 21:32.955
Come on.

21:36.543 --> 21:37.795
- What's going on?
- Nothin'.

21:37.878 --> 21:41.424
The guy's punchin' on the breaks.
Just take care of it. We're fine.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.846
I can't see nothin', man.
Just go and cut 'em off, Angie.

21:45.888 --> 21:48.725
No, no. You can't fight
with no gloves on.

21:49.559 --> 21:51.520
Just get up. Get up.
Try and do it. Come on.

21:51.562 --> 21:54.023
I can't see, man.

21:54.065 --> 21:56.735
- Come on, Cass!
- Dance!

22:03.410 --> 22:05.412
Liston crouching,
hitting to the body.

22:05.495 --> 22:08.457
It's like he's blinking,
like he doesn't see Liston.

22:08.541 --> 22:11.127
Ref, you gotta doy our job.

22:20.848 --> 22:21.891
Hold it.

22:24.894 --> 22:27.272
Stay away from him, Clay.
Stay away from him.

22:28.065 --> 22:30.443
The champion, you can see,
is the aggressor.

22:36.909 --> 22:38.828
- Get him, Cass!
- Come on, Cass!

22:39.913 --> 22:42.416
- Knock him up!
- Clay looks all done.

22:42.499 --> 22:44.502
Hold on to him!

22:48.715 --> 22:51.510
- Stop it. Stop. Break.
- Knock him up.

22:54.889 --> 22:57.309
Get on him.
Get on him, man.

23:14.497 --> 23:17.459
- You can see him now.
- You go get him, man.

23:28.598 --> 23:31.101
Clay lands a left,
but Liston ducked under it...

23:31.184 --> 23:33.437
and took it high
on the forehead.

23:34.396 --> 23:36.607
It's Clay coming on.

23:41.530 --> 23:44.242
And Liston backs away.

24:29.923 --> 24:33.636
And all the predictions
are going down the drain...

24:33.719 --> 24:35.638
as Liston is listless.

24:38.016 --> 24:39.810
And there's the bell.

24:42.730 --> 24:44.649
We're coming up to round seven.

25:22.988 --> 25:25.324
Wait a minute!

25:25.408 --> 25:27.202
Liston's not coming out.

25:28.203 --> 25:31.499
The winner and new heavyweight
champion of the world is Cassius Clay.

25:31.582 --> 25:35.629
Eat your words!
Eat your words!

25:35.670 --> 25:39.467
Les, I'm going up into the ring.
Get back.

25:40.677 --> 25:43.055
I'm the greatest thing
ever happened to boxing.

25:43.138 --> 25:44.974
Cassius. Cassius.

25:45.015 --> 25:47.602
I shook up the world!

25:47.685 --> 25:50.939
It's a scene of
absolute bedlam in the ring!

25:51.023 --> 25:55.278
I am the greatest.
I'm a bad man. I shook up the world!

25:55.361 --> 25:57.072
Did he ever hurt you?

25:57.155 --> 26:00.159
I'm only 22 years old.
I ain't got a mark on my face.

26:00.201 --> 26:02.161
- I must be the greatest.
- And you're pretty.

26:02.203 --> 26:04.164
I must be the greatest.

26:04.206 --> 26:07.501
Wait. Hold on. Hold on one second.
That's Sam Cooke back there.

26:07.543 --> 26:09.504
- Come on, Sam Cooke.
- Let Sam Cooke in here.

26:09.545 --> 26:12.466
The greatest rock-and-roll singer,
and I'm the world's greatest boxer.

26:12.549 --> 26:14.051
Hello, Sam.

26:22.979 --> 26:25.148
That mummy's
gonna get him, baby.

26:25.982 --> 26:28.402
- That mummy ain't gonna get him.
- Yeah, he is.

26:28.485 --> 26:32.741
He ain't scared of that mummy.
That mummy too slow to catch anybody.

26:33.700 --> 26:36.328
- What's going on, Sam?
- How you doing, Cassius?

26:36.412 --> 26:40.876
Don't believe that stuff on TV.
Don't listen to him.

26:40.917 --> 26:43.045
- Hey, congratulations, Clay.
- Hey, thank you, Jim.

26:43.128 --> 26:46.132
- Hell of a fight.
- You next, man. You next.

26:46.215 --> 26:49.511
- Go ahead and get some food, brother.
- Cassius Clay versus Jim Brown.

26:49.595 --> 26:51.013
Biggest fight in history.

26:51.096 --> 26:54.225
- The mummy only has one eye.
- One eye and a limp.

26:54.267 --> 26:56.895
That mummy's 643 years old.

26:56.937 --> 26:58.898
He can't catch nobody.
Look at him.

26:58.939 --> 27:02.152
You gotta fall down 'cause that's
the only way the mummy could catch you.

27:13.666 --> 27:15.126
Way to go, champ!

27:17.796 --> 27:21.217
- Yeah, you the greatest.
- Thank you, brother. Thank you.

27:21.300 --> 27:23.261
- I'll see your next fight.
- You'll see the next one?

27:23.344 --> 27:26.181
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, you better get there very early.

27:26.265 --> 27:29.268
You better get there very early
'cause that man's going down.

27:31.980 --> 27:34.608
If he talk a little jive,
he's going down in five.

27:36.527 --> 27:39.489
He talk a little more,
I might drop him in four.

27:40.616 --> 27:42.785
If you wanna have more fun,
do it in round one.

27:42.868 --> 27:44.954
Oh, yeah. Hold on.
I'm doing the rhymin'.

27:58.972 --> 28:02.226
The people really look up to you. You
plan on being a champ like Joe Louis?

28:02.309 --> 28:05.271
Well, yeah, I'm gonna be
the people's champ.

28:05.354 --> 28:07.732
Not like Joe Louis.
Well, you know, not exactly.

28:10.194 --> 28:12.321
My name is not Clay.

28:12.363 --> 28:14.950
Clay is the name of the people
that owned my ancestors...

28:15.033 --> 28:18.037
and I no longer wanna be called
by that slave name.

28:18.120 --> 28:20.373
- I am Cassius X.
- Minister Malcolm.

28:20.456 --> 28:22.709
What about the divisions
in the Nation of Islam?

28:22.793 --> 28:26.797
This is the champ's time. I'm here
as a friend to support his victory...

28:26.881 --> 28:29.342
so I have nothing you want.

28:29.384 --> 28:31.386
I'm definitely gonna be
the people's champion...

28:31.428 --> 28:33.889
but I just ain't gonna be the champ
the way you want me to be the champ.

28:33.973 --> 28:36.393
I'm gonna be the champ
the way I wanna be.

28:47.573 --> 28:50.201
For no home is immune
to termites...

28:50.243 --> 28:53.372
no matter how well
it is built or maintained.

28:53.455 --> 28:55.416
- Hey, brother.
- I was leaving.

28:55.499 --> 28:58.753
I saw your light on.
What you doing up at this hour, champ?

28:58.837 --> 29:02.591
Oh, man, I'm watching this program
on termites.

29:02.675 --> 29:06.930
And them little itsy-bitsy things is
eatin' these people's whole house down.

29:07.014 --> 29:09.725
Oh, man, look.

29:12.854 --> 29:17.610
I've been invited to speak
at Ibadan University in Nigeria.

29:17.652 --> 29:20.363
- You wanna go with me?
- Hey, look, man.

29:20.447 --> 29:24.577
You can have six million termites
in your house and don't even know it...

29:24.619 --> 29:27.580
till you going to get something to eat
and you bust through the floor.

29:29.458 --> 29:33.212
- What'd you say? Where?
- Africa. You been?

29:34.297 --> 29:35.215
Africa.

29:35.298 --> 29:37.634
All right, come on.
Let's go.

29:43.225 --> 29:44.810
What is it?

29:49.316 --> 29:51.902
You ever thought you'd lose it?

29:51.985 --> 29:54.739
I mean, really lose it?

29:58.577 --> 30:02.332
When I was little, I tore out
this picture of Emmett Till.

30:02.415 --> 30:04.334
They put the barbed wire
around his neck...

30:04.417 --> 30:08.589
and strapped him
to that 75-pound cotton gin fan.

30:08.673 --> 30:12.511
And they cut out one of his eyes
'cause he looked at some white lady.

30:14.346 --> 30:16.307
Man.

30:16.349 --> 30:19.436
I couldn't take my eyes to it,
couldn't throw it away.

30:24.025 --> 30:26.945
When I heard about those...

30:27.029 --> 30:29.991
four little girls who got bombed
in that Birmingham church...

30:33.203 --> 30:35.914
the prohibitions of the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad prevented me...

30:35.998 --> 30:38.251
from speaking
my thoughts in action.

30:40.253 --> 30:42.464
Because Birmingham was part
of the civil rights struggle.

30:42.548 --> 30:46.761
You know, begging for our place
at the white man's table.

30:46.845 --> 30:49.515
But dead children
are dead children.

30:49.598 --> 30:54.145
So the anger I felt
I had to contain.

30:56.064 --> 30:59.151
I locked it up so tight...

30:59.235 --> 31:01.154
my muscles seized.

31:02.322 --> 31:05.242
I lost control
over the right side of my body.

31:05.326 --> 31:07.745
My leg gave out.

31:07.829 --> 31:10.540
Right arm gave out.
"I'm having a stroke," I thought.

31:12.126 --> 31:15.254
But I had to hold it in
'cause all I wanted...

31:15.338 --> 31:19.802
Brother, all I wanted to do
was find something and break it.

31:19.885 --> 31:23.056
Break a part...
Break any part of this system...

31:23.139 --> 31:27.353
because you are so provoked
in your heart...

31:27.436 --> 31:29.564
and your spirit
as a human being...

31:31.483 --> 31:33.444
at dead children.

31:35.112 --> 31:37.198
And I could do...

31:39.785 --> 31:41.537
nothing.

31:49.964 --> 31:53.718
Everyone knows
I can't do nothing...

31:53.802 --> 31:55.220
anymore.

31:59.726 --> 32:03.272
So Elijah Muhammad has suspended me
as a minister in the Nation of Islam.

32:11.782 --> 32:14.619
Man...

32:14.661 --> 32:16.204
you can fix that.

32:16.288 --> 32:19.166
I don't know.

32:19.208 --> 32:21.503
I'll try when we get back.

32:29.721 --> 32:31.765
You get some rest, champ.

32:31.849 --> 32:33.768
All right, brother.

33:09.061 --> 33:10.021
Sit.

33:22.411 --> 33:27.041
You know, only after
long service and high merit...

33:27.083 --> 33:31.547
in the spiritual and physical rebirth
of Afro-American people...

33:31.589 --> 33:33.841
is one granted an original name.

33:33.925 --> 33:36.678
But you are special.

33:36.762 --> 33:38.222
A world champion.

33:40.767 --> 33:43.395
So there is a gift
I wish to give you.

33:43.437 --> 33:45.439
From this day forward...

33:45.481 --> 33:49.986
you will be known
as Muhammad Ali.

33:54.158 --> 33:56.536
- What?
- That's right.

33:56.619 --> 33:58.539
You what?

34:01.042 --> 34:04.754
Well, what's wrong with our name?
My name?

34:04.796 --> 34:07.132
We... We made you.

34:07.216 --> 34:08.676
Ain't nobody made me.

34:08.759 --> 34:10.887
No bow tie-wearin',
Arab-talkin' nigger gonna change that.

34:10.969 --> 34:12.889
Ain't nobody in that ring but me.
I made me.

34:12.973 --> 34:15.476
You don't know who you are.

34:15.559 --> 34:18.313
I know who I ain't.
I ain't drinkin'.

34:18.396 --> 34:20.690
I ain't going back on my wife
and for sure I ain't prayin'...

34:20.774 --> 34:22.943
to no blond-haired,
blue-eyed Jesus.

34:22.985 --> 34:26.947
Paintin' those blue-eyed, blond-haired
Jesuses is what put food in you.

34:27.032 --> 34:29.702
- Steak and vegetables on the table.
- It's dinner!

34:35.333 --> 34:37.253
Go ahead.

34:38.379 --> 34:39.714
Go ahead.

35:01.658 --> 35:02.909
Hello?

35:03.827 --> 35:06.372
Here you go, Daddy.

35:06.455 --> 35:07.999
Thank you, baby.

35:08.041 --> 35:10.502
- Yeah?
- Brother Malcolm.

35:10.544 --> 35:14.590
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad has given
the Muslim name of Muhammad Ali...

35:14.674 --> 35:17.427
to Cassius X.

35:17.511 --> 35:20.931
Herbert Muhammad has been put
in charge of his training.

35:21.015 --> 35:23.268
He will not be traveling
with you to Africa.

35:23.351 --> 35:25.979
He also asked me
to inform you...

35:26.063 --> 35:29.066
that your suspension
will be extended indefiinitely.

35:39.705 --> 35:42.166
Brother Cassius
won't be coming to Africa.

35:45.754 --> 35:47.714
Not with me.

35:51.678 --> 35:53.805
Don't put it off.

35:59.062 --> 36:00.981
We'll be fine.

36:06.112 --> 36:07.489
I will.

36:07.572 --> 36:10.743
I got a little doll
for Atallah.

36:10.784 --> 36:11.869
Really?

36:11.952 --> 36:13.579
Yeah, it? s beautiful.

36:13.621 --> 36:16.458
I've got so much
to show the girls when I get back.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.919
- I'm taking alot of pictures.
- Yeah?

36:18.961 --> 36:21.297
Yeah, I got some good stuff
I want to show you.

36:21.381 --> 36:23.300
Are you eating?

36:24.301 --> 36:26.888
Well, you're not cooking, so...

36:26.971 --> 36:29.599
- What's going on? Anything?
- Nothing.

36:30.559 --> 36:32.686
He's on the phone,
talking to his wife.

36:32.770 --> 36:35.940
She's having a hard time sleeping,
the baby's kicking a lot...

36:36.024 --> 36:38.318
what are they gonna
name the baby.

36:41.155 --> 36:45.202
I just wake up a couple of times
in the night, but it? s okay.

36:57.800 --> 37:00.178
Would you like to take a seat?

37:00.220 --> 37:02.181
Sure, thank you.

37:05.852 --> 37:08.063
What y'all done did
with the real pilot?

37:08.147 --> 37:11.025
I am the pilot.
He's the copilot.

37:11.067 --> 37:13.028
Here. Sit down, Mr. Clay.

37:13.069 --> 37:15.489
Oh, man.

37:15.531 --> 37:19.494
In Louisville, where I growed up,
they barely let black folks drive buses.

38:59.325 --> 39:00.576
Muhammad!

39:04.039 --> 39:07.835
Hey, brother.
What's going on, man?

39:12.007 --> 39:13.968
- What you doing here?
- I was just going to the airport.

39:14.010 --> 39:16.638
We just got here now.
So where you going?

39:16.680 --> 39:17.639
Liberia.

39:17.681 --> 39:21.143
Say hello to Maya Angelou right here
and Ambassador Huang Hua.

39:21.185 --> 39:24.022
And that is Taher Kaid.
He's the ambassador from Algeria.

39:24.105 --> 39:27.276
Oh, man. Where should I go?
I wanna go all over this place.

39:27.359 --> 39:29.487
Go to Algeria.
See Ben Bella.

39:29.570 --> 39:33.867
Then go to see Mecca and Medina.
I just came from there.

39:33.951 --> 39:36.287
Made my seven circuits
around the Kaaba.

39:36.370 --> 39:39.499
I prayed at sunrise. Two million people.
Pilgrims from all over, man.

39:39.541 --> 39:42.712
Dressed the same.
High and low, the same.

39:42.795 --> 39:46.633
Blond-haired, blue-eyed Muslims,
Arabs, Africans, Indonesians.

40:01.443 --> 40:04.363
Seeing brothers just like us,
praying together, it was beautiful.

40:04.405 --> 40:06.449
I drank water
from the well of Zem Zem.

40:06.532 --> 40:11.580
I prayed in the ancient city of Mena.
I prayed on Mount Arafat.

40:11.664 --> 40:14.083
You shouldn't have quarreled
with Elijah Muhammad.

40:15.418 --> 40:17.629
Walking in their footsteps.

40:17.713 --> 40:19.340
All of us together.

40:19.423 --> 40:22.260
You shouldn't have quarreled
with the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

40:23.094 --> 40:24.721
What?

40:25.890 --> 40:29.310
You shouldn't have quarreled
with Elijah Muhammad.

40:29.394 --> 40:31.897
Hey, Brother Muhammad,
look here.

40:36.236 --> 40:38.155
Brother Muhammad!

41:00.390 --> 41:02.393
Listen, I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

41:16.493 --> 41:18.120
Into each life...

41:18.204 --> 41:20.248
a little rain must fall.

41:20.331 --> 41:23.210
And, you know,
every day cannot be sunny.

41:23.293 --> 41:25.963
Every smile is not
a smile of happiness.

41:26.005 --> 41:27.507
And every tear that is shed...

41:27.549 --> 41:29.801
Sonji, Sonji, Sonji.

41:29.843 --> 41:33.598
- What you keep saying my name for?
- 'Cause I love it, girl.

41:33.681 --> 41:36.059
- How long you been working with Herbert?
- About a year.

41:36.143 --> 41:39.021
I sell Muhammad Speaks
over the phone.

41:39.105 --> 41:42.901
- What kind of name is that?
- My father named me after Sonja Henie.

41:44.027 --> 41:45.988
What's your father do?

41:46.030 --> 41:50.160
He was shot in a poker game
when I was two, so he don't do nothing.

41:50.243 --> 41:52.663
And my mother died
when I was eleven.

41:52.705 --> 41:55.583
- Who raised you?
- My godparents.

41:55.667 --> 41:59.672
But I been off on my own
for a long time.

42:00.798 --> 42:02.759
What you doing tomorrow?
Go for a ride with me.

42:02.842 --> 42:05.303
- Oh, no, no. I gotta work.
- I'm gonna square it with Herbert.

42:05.387 --> 42:08.265
- Herbert said you met the Beatles.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

42:08.349 --> 42:11.353
Only one of 'em is smart, though.
The fella with the glasses.

42:11.394 --> 42:13.564
Oh, he is my favorite.

42:13.647 --> 42:16.275
Yeah, folks was screaming
and fainting.

42:16.359 --> 42:18.778
I said, "Man, is this how they act
when you get big?"

42:18.862 --> 42:21.490
- What did he say?
- He said, "Champ...

42:21.573 --> 42:25.453
the more real you get,
the more unreal it's gonna get."

42:26.371 --> 42:28.373
Wow.

42:33.839 --> 42:35.758
Your

42:37.009 --> 42:41.181
Precious love

42:41.264 --> 42:42.975
Love

42:43.058 --> 42:46.896
Means more tome

42:48.982 --> 42:53.154
More, more

42:53.237 --> 42:56.450
Than any love

42:56.533 --> 42:58.953
Can ever bring me

42:58.994 --> 43:01.915
Never came true

43:01.956 --> 43:04.543
Oh, and I

43:07.463 --> 43:09.466
I wanted you

43:09.549 --> 43:12.177
Let me tell ya I was so lonely

43:12.261 --> 43:16.182
So lonely, lonely
So lonely and so blue

43:17.267 --> 43:19.645
Good God All mighty

43:19.687 --> 43:21.898
That's what love will do

43:21.981 --> 43:23.441
Do

43:28.364 --> 43:30.658
Let's go.

43:30.742 --> 43:32.244
Yeah.

43:32.327 --> 43:34.371
Where you live?

43:34.455 --> 43:36.374
I'm gonna take you there.

43:37.667 --> 43:41.004
And you know I got a man somewhere
out there that I don't mind crawling to.

43:41.088 --> 43:44.425
Sometimes I wake up in the midnight
hour, tears rolling down my face.

43:44.509 --> 43:46.428
And if I look around for my man
and I can't find him...

43:46.511 --> 43:48.973
I follow the Lord,
look a little higher.

43:49.014 --> 43:50.766
Kind of pray to the Lord.

43:50.850 --> 43:54.020
Because I always believed that the Lord
could help me if nobody else could.

43:54.104 --> 43:56.023
But sometime
I think he don't even hear me.

43:56.065 --> 43:58.526
So I have to fall a little lower
on my knees, look a little higher.

43:58.568 --> 44:00.695
Kind of raise my voice
a little higher.

44:00.779 --> 44:02.906
And this is what I say
when I call on my man.

44:02.990 --> 44:06.452
I especially want you ladies to listen
to me 'cause maybe you can try this.

44:06.536 --> 44:08.538
It might help you
every once in a while.

44:08.622 --> 44:11.083
This is what you say
when you call on your man.

44:11.166 --> 44:13.085
Get in tune to...

44:19.760 --> 44:24.558
Darlin'

44:24.600 --> 44:28.104
Darlin; don't you know

44:28.187 --> 44:32.067
That I love you so much, yeah

44:33.694 --> 44:35.989
Fall down on my knees

44:36.072 --> 44:38.158
Beg my baby, please

44:38.241 --> 44:41.787
I got to tell the man
that I love him, yes, I will

44:45.000 --> 44:46.960
For your precious love

44:47.044 --> 44:49.213
For your precious love

44:49.297 --> 44:51.716
There? s nothing
There? s nothing, nothing

44:51.758 --> 44:55.054
In this whole wide world
I wouldn? t do for you, darling

44:56.931 --> 44:59.935
I'll walk all night
out in the rain

45:00.018 --> 45:03.648
Lord, I got to see
my baby again

45:03.731 --> 45:06.318
I got to tell the man
that I love him

45:06.401 --> 45:08.487
One more time, yeah

45:23.672 --> 45:25.174
You ain't no Muslim, huh?

45:25.258 --> 45:29.096
Cover my hair, wear no makeup
and wear those long dresses?

45:29.137 --> 45:30.681
Honey, please.

45:34.978 --> 45:36.480
Were you a virgin?

45:37.272 --> 45:40.359
A virgin? How you gonna...
What you saying?

45:40.443 --> 45:44.823
Well, you were just so gone,
off on a little good time.

45:44.865 --> 45:47.994
Well, no, I ain't no virgin.

45:48.077 --> 45:49.537
But I may as well be.

45:50.413 --> 45:52.833
I ain't joking.

45:52.875 --> 45:55.628
I always know when I know.

45:57.714 --> 46:00.009
You see this face?

46:00.050 --> 46:02.136
You got a pretty face
for a lady's face...

46:02.220 --> 46:04.639
but you ever seen anything
as pretty as me?

46:04.681 --> 46:07.393
Who wouldn't want
to be with me?

46:07.476 --> 46:09.604
What, you five foot three
or something like that?

46:09.687 --> 46:12.232
That's too small for me,
but I'm gonna make an exception.

46:12.315 --> 46:14.652
- Oh, well, thank you.
- Because of your spirit.

46:14.693 --> 46:17.322
- My spirit?
- Yeah, girl. You too much fun.

46:17.363 --> 46:19.991
- But you got to be a Muslim.
- A Muslim?

46:20.033 --> 46:23.621
And how you do that? You jump over
a broom and, shazam, you're a Muslim?

46:23.704 --> 46:26.541
I ain't never been
with nobody like you.

46:26.625 --> 46:28.627
And, baby...

46:28.711 --> 46:32.048
baby, you ain't never
gonna be with any other.

46:48.777 --> 46:50.738
- What?
- That's right.

46:52.990 --> 46:55.118
I wanna marry her.

46:57.287 --> 46:58.747
True love.

46:58.789 --> 47:02.127
You don't marry that girl.
She was a date.

47:02.210 --> 47:03.879
Have some fun.

47:03.920 --> 47:07.675
She's not your wife.
You don't marry this girl.

47:07.759 --> 47:11.221
Here's some management papers.
I need you to sign right there.

47:11.263 --> 47:12.973
My father would kill me.

47:14.308 --> 47:15.977
Watch what you're signing, Ali.

47:16.060 --> 47:17.979
This ain't got nothing
to do with you.

47:18.063 --> 47:22.235
Anything's to do with me I say is to do
with me, fat boy. I'm still a Christian.

47:22.902 --> 47:26.406
And get me a kosher cook. I want
that lady over at Malcolm's temple.

47:26.448 --> 47:28.534
- Lana Shabazz.
- And put my brother on payroll.

47:28.617 --> 47:31.162
Fifty G a year
just for drivin' and jivin'.

47:31.246 --> 47:34.166
What do you say, Howard?
Come on full-time as my photographer?

47:34.249 --> 47:38.046
I'm not gonna be on the payroll.
I'm freelance. Emphasis on "free."

47:38.129 --> 47:40.799
Muhammad, she's not for you.

47:40.883 --> 47:42.927
When I met her,
she worked in a cocktail lounge...

47:42.968 --> 47:45.096
with a bunny tail
on her backside.

47:45.138 --> 47:48.058
What the hell was you doing
in a bunny tail lounge anyway, Herbert?

47:48.141 --> 47:49.977
Sellin' Muhammad Peeks?

47:52.814 --> 47:56.569
- You been saving it up training, Ali.
- Your ass.

47:56.652 --> 47:59.364
You should spread that stuff around
a little bit before you settle down.

47:59.447 --> 48:02.451
No, man. Marriage is
the cornerstone of Muslim life.

48:02.492 --> 48:06.623
- Yeah, well, Sonji Roi is not a Muslim.
- Well, she's gonna be now.

48:06.664 --> 48:09.084
You just fix it up, Herbert.

48:26.439 --> 48:29.150
Yeah. Okay.

48:29.234 --> 48:32.112
So, why we meeting?

48:32.196 --> 48:35.324
I got Malcolm shoulder to shoulder
with Martin Luther King.

48:35.366 --> 48:38.286
And we got Malcolm traveling all over
the world, getting Ben Bella and Nasser.

48:41.832 --> 48:44.753
We were better off before
with Malcolm inside the Nation.

48:46.713 --> 48:50.510
So we've decided we want you...

48:50.552 --> 48:54.014
to get Elijah Muhammad
to take Malcolm back.

49:02.441 --> 49:04.485
That's a joke, Joe.

49:16.709 --> 49:19.879
When am I being reimbursed
for my expenses?

49:19.963 --> 49:22.299
Dry-cleaning all these suits
is not free.

49:24.176 --> 49:26.554
We gotta talk about this guy too.

49:30.267 --> 49:33.730
Get me receipts, I'll reimburse you
for your dry cleaning.

49:43.408 --> 49:45.327
- What you drinking?
- What I'm drinking?

49:45.411 --> 49:48.331
Come on, champ. This is water.
You know I'm a natural man.

49:48.414 --> 49:49.833
You know.

49:49.916 --> 49:52.836
- What's going on? We're late.
- I'm changing my damn clothes.

49:52.920 --> 49:56.382
You gave me that look,
so I know you don't like what I had on.

49:57.801 --> 50:00.429
- What is this?
- What you wanted, isn't it?

50:00.513 --> 50:02.724
- A water glass with vodka in it.
- No, that was before.

50:02.807 --> 50:06.228
- Before what, sir?
- Before you showed up. Get out of here.

50:07.646 --> 50:10.775
I'm fine running around here
in these cute, short things for you.

50:10.859 --> 50:12.569
I am submissive to you.

50:12.652 --> 50:15.990
I ain't gonna be submissive to them
Brother X's and Z's...

50:16.073 --> 50:17.951
about what they think.

50:17.992 --> 50:20.579
They ask me a bunch
of questions all the time anyway.

50:20.662 --> 50:22.623
- What questions?
- About you and us.

50:22.665 --> 50:25.418
- And I ain't telling them shit.
- You tell it like it is, sugar.

50:29.340 --> 50:32.176
Took away my boy's name.
What they give him back?

50:32.218 --> 50:33.553
Bad style.

50:36.265 --> 50:40.603
I think you drunk.
Daddy Clay, you're something else.

50:40.687 --> 50:44.149
Now, that's a firecracker right there.
We're gonna have to work with that.

50:44.233 --> 50:46.194
- A scale of one to ten.
- That's right.

50:46.235 --> 50:48.405
I have one... I had a ten...
Well, I didn't have a ten.

50:48.488 --> 50:51.158
I had a five...
five good twos.

50:52.702 --> 50:56.373
I don't drink. I don't smoke.
I converted to Islam for you.

50:56.456 --> 50:59.335
Okay? l...
All except the dress.

52:40.125 --> 52:42.628
What you doing in my pockets, man?
Get your hand out of my pocket!

52:42.712 --> 52:44.965
- Hold it, my brothers.
- We got a thief in here!

52:45.006 --> 52:47.134
Just be cool.

52:47.217 --> 52:48.803
Be cool.

53:40.616 --> 53:42.494
Brother, you crazy?

53:42.577 --> 53:45.956
They killed Malcolm!
They shot Malcolm! They shot Malcolm!

53:46.040 --> 53:47.959
They shot Malcolm!

53:49.794 --> 53:54.342
Wash it seven times
in the chest and body...

53:54.425 --> 53:57.012
and one in the lower
right shin.

53:57.095 --> 54:00.683
Apparently, the unknown man...

54:00.766 --> 54:04.270
walked up
to the speaker's platform...

54:04.354 --> 54:08.150
at the time
Malcolm X was speaking...

54:09.610 --> 54:13.240
opened fire at him
at very short range.

55:20.364 --> 55:23.576
The arena is surrounded by FBI.

55:23.660 --> 55:26.163
The stands are only half full.

55:26.204 --> 55:30.251
The promoter has taken out
a million-dollar insurance policy...

55:30.335 --> 55:35.508
due to Cassius Clay's membership in
the militant and radical black Muslims.

55:35.591 --> 55:39.679
And, oh, by the way,
Sonny Liston is here too.

55:39.721 --> 55:42.349
Touch gloves
and come out fighting.

56:13.930 --> 56:15.515
Come on, son.

56:15.599 --> 56:18.310
- Come on, Chi-Chi.
- Put a whupping on him now.

56:24.234 --> 56:26.403
Ain't nothing changed.

56:26.487 --> 56:28.865
Whup on him now.
Whup up on him.

56:31.451 --> 56:33.329
Way to go!

56:35.123 --> 56:38.084
- There it is!
- Sock it to him, baby!

56:47.304 --> 56:48.723
Yes!

56:48.806 --> 56:51.434
Get up!
Ain't nobody gonna believe this.

56:51.518 --> 56:53.604
Get up!

56:53.687 --> 56:54.855
Yes!

57:07.996 --> 57:09.957
Confused.
We're confused.

57:11.584 --> 57:14.004
- Check his time.
- Timekeeper's sounding it's over.

57:14.045 --> 57:16.006
Check his time!

57:18.134 --> 57:19.218
It is over!

57:31.609 --> 57:34.028
I think the champ
was in a hurry.

57:42.706 --> 57:44.124
Are you okay?

57:46.210 --> 57:48.296
What's wrong?

57:48.379 --> 57:51.299
Why you all done up like that?

57:54.053 --> 57:56.556
I'm out there dying for you
out of worry.

57:56.639 --> 57:58.141
- Worry?
- Yes.

57:58.225 --> 58:00.644
And all you can think about
is if I look dull enough?

58:01.437 --> 58:04.566
What if I straightened my hair
and moved into some white suburb?

58:04.649 --> 58:06.693
How I am says something.

58:30.806 --> 58:33.184
You want me to go get her?

58:45.783 --> 58:46.951
Not now.

58:47.035 --> 58:48.954
- Not right now, fellas.
- Not now.

58:54.627 --> 58:58.090
- What I got to do?
- About Sonji?

58:58.132 --> 59:00.426
Have no contact with her
for 90 days.

59:00.510 --> 59:02.762
Make a public statement
of divorce at the mosque...

59:02.804 --> 59:05.015
and Islamic law
will be satisfied.

59:05.099 --> 59:08.561
Satisfaction is not making it with
the woman who send you to the moon?

59:08.645 --> 59:10.605
I'm the only normal person
left around here.

59:10.689 --> 59:13.275
I'm a black Jew, I can't read
and I'm half drunk.

59:15.445 --> 59:16.905
I need to talk to you.

59:18.323 --> 59:21.452
- No, you can stay, Brother Herbert.
- Brother? He ain't your brother.

59:21.535 --> 59:24.748
Your brother's taking your wife back
to Chicago. She's crying like a widow.

59:24.831 --> 59:27.501
- Well, I ain't dead.
- Well, you may as well be.

59:27.584 --> 59:30.129
You don't remember your name
or who you are.

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.306
You gonna try for Germany?

01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:48.100
You gonna try to get
stationed in Germany?

01:00:48.184 --> 01:00:52.939
- Everybody is trying to avoid Vietnam.
- What you talkin' about, man?

01:00:53.023 --> 01:00:56.027
They changed your classification.
It's in the paper.

01:00:56.110 --> 01:00:57.904
- What?
- Champ. Eskridge.

01:00:57.946 --> 01:00:59.406
You're 1 A.

01:01:02.451 --> 01:01:04.912
They tryin' to draft me in the army?
You know about this?

01:01:04.954 --> 01:01:06.206
Okay, here we go.

01:01:07.332 --> 01:01:11.379
All right, all right.
Hey, I got to go.

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:17.303
They started runnin'.

01:01:19.472 --> 01:01:19.597
You know, so I went down there,
I did everything I was supposed to do...

01:01:19.598 --> 01:01:22.142
You know, so I went down there,
I did everything I was supposed to do...

01:01:22.225 --> 01:01:24.144
and I flunked
their draft board test.

01:01:24.228 --> 01:01:28.316
Then without testing me again,
to see if I'm any wiser or worser...

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.819
they decide
I can go in the army?

01:01:30.903 --> 01:01:33.155
- Cassius, in my opinion...
- My name ain't Cassius Clay.

01:01:33.239 --> 01:01:35.784
That is a slave name,
and I am a free man.

01:01:35.867 --> 01:01:37.452
I am Muhammad Ali.

01:01:37.536 --> 01:01:42.792
You know, I apologize.
I apologize to you on the air.

01:01:42.876 --> 01:01:45.087
Your name is Muhammad Ali.

01:01:45.170 --> 01:01:47.298
You have a right to be called
whatever you want.

01:01:47.381 --> 01:01:49.342
I apologize to you.

01:01:49.384 --> 01:01:52.972
You sure make a lot of mistakes
for a so-called educated man.

01:01:53.055 --> 01:01:55.475
- You really went to law school?
- Yes, Muhammad.

01:01:55.516 --> 01:01:59.313
And to think I gave up a lucrative
practice for the likes of you.

01:01:59.354 --> 01:02:01.357
I'm the best thing
ever happened to you, Cosell.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:05.278
Without me, you'd be a tall white man
with a microphone in his mouth.

01:02:05.362 --> 01:02:08.616
And without me,
you'd be a mouth.

01:02:15.541 --> 01:02:17.460
We'll be right back.

01:02:18.878 --> 01:02:22.508
- You want some food for that thing?
- How could you do such a thing?

01:02:22.591 --> 01:02:25.219
- 'Cause it's funny.
- To someone you revere.

01:02:25.303 --> 01:02:28.223
- That thing almost bit my finger off.
- Mr. Bundini...

01:02:28.265 --> 01:02:32.520
I'm glad you were here
to witness this... this assault.

01:02:35.273 --> 01:02:37.902
Have a little coffee
with your sugar.

01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:43.909
They're coming after you...

01:02:43.993 --> 01:02:47.539
because they're scared of
black militancy in the inner cities.

01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:53.421
I ain't no H. Rap Brown.
I ain't no Stokely Carmichael.

01:02:53.463 --> 01:02:55.256
All they are is political.

01:02:55.340 --> 01:02:57.926
You're the heavyweight
champion of the world.

01:03:13.737 --> 01:03:15.865
Here's the deal the government offered.
You do six weeks in basic.

01:03:15.948 --> 01:03:18.452
You go to the reserves.
You don't go to Vietnam.

01:03:18.535 --> 01:03:21.455
Now, the messenger would not object
if you joined under those terms.

01:03:21.539 --> 01:03:23.333
I stay out of jail and keep boxing.

01:03:23.416 --> 01:03:25.710
If you accept the induction,
life goes on.

01:03:36.474 --> 01:03:36.515
Marvin Decker Anderson,
US Army.

01:03:36.516 --> 01:03:40.270
Marvin Decker Anderson,
US Army.

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:45.568
Juan Raymondo Benitez, US Army.

01:03:47.571 --> 01:03:50.825
Pryce Marshall Benson,
US Marines.

01:03:55.330 --> 01:03:59.460
Cassius Marcellus Clay,
US Army.

01:04:10.682 --> 01:04:12.476
Mr. Clay,
I'm required to inform you...

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.522
that refusal to accept
a lawful induction order...

01:04:16.314 --> 01:04:18.525
constitutes a felony...

01:04:18.609 --> 01:04:22.322
under the Universal Military
Training and Service Act...

01:04:22.363 --> 01:04:26.452
punishable by
five years imprisonment...

01:04:26.535 --> 01:04:29.372
and a $10,000 fine.

01:04:29.456 --> 01:04:31.041
Do you understand?

01:04:31.625 --> 01:04:34.003
Yes, sir.

01:04:53.735 --> 01:04:56.489
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

01:04:56.572 --> 01:04:59.409
Mr. Clay, you're under arrest
for refusing induction.

01:05:37.497 --> 01:05:39.542
Yeah.

01:05:39.625 --> 01:05:41.836
Yeah, this is me.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:45.632
No, you got to ask Chauncey Eskridge.
That's my lawyer. He's in Chicago.

01:05:47.468 --> 01:05:49.387
No, I'm out on bail.

01:05:51.473 --> 01:05:54.852
No, man, I ain't never
shot nothin' in my life.

01:05:54.936 --> 01:05:58.857
No ducks, no geese,
no deer, no nothin'.

01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:02.570
Yeah, I know where Vietnam is.
It's on TV.

01:06:04.114 --> 01:06:07.910
Southeast Asia?
What, it's there too?

01:06:11.873 --> 01:06:14.042
What do I think about who?

01:06:14.126 --> 01:06:15.669
The Vietcong?

01:06:18.006 --> 01:06:21.176
Man, I ain't got no quarrel
with them Vietcong.

01:06:22.803 --> 01:06:26.099
Ain't no Vietcong
ever called me nigger.

01:06:27.058 --> 01:06:29.103
Yeah, that's right.

01:06:34.067 --> 01:06:36.737
You know what you're doin', Ali?

01:06:38.030 --> 01:06:39.824
You know what you just said?

01:06:40.492 --> 01:06:42.536
Everyone, Europe to China,
every home in America...

01:06:42.619 --> 01:06:44.663
everyone? s gonna know what the
heavyweight champion of the world...

01:06:44.705 --> 01:06:46.833
said about the US war.

01:06:48.627 --> 01:06:51.630
So what? So what?
I ain't got to be...

01:06:51.714 --> 01:06:53.674
what nobody else
want me to be...

01:06:53.716 --> 01:06:56.386
and I ain't afraid to be
what I wanna be...

01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:58.472
think how I wanna think.

01:07:17.412 --> 01:07:20.416
I got almost nowhere I can
promote a fight for you.

01:07:20.499 --> 01:07:22.919
Plus I think they're gonna
vacate you from the crown.

01:07:23.002 --> 01:07:25.255
- What?
- Yeah, if you're convicted.

01:07:26.924 --> 01:07:30.136
Oh, so they're gonna take from me
what no fighter in the world can.

01:07:30.219 --> 01:07:32.180
And New York may revoke
your boxing license.

01:07:32.264 --> 01:07:35.225
You sure you wanna do this?

01:07:35.309 --> 01:07:38.396
The next three to four years
are every heavyweight's prime.

01:07:38.479 --> 01:07:41.358
There are few of those years.

01:07:44.111 --> 01:07:47.240
- What about Terrell?
- We'll know about that this afternoon.

01:07:47.282 --> 01:07:50.578
I gotta find us some venues fast.
I'll call you later.

01:07:55.208 --> 01:08:00.757
You understand the issue is your
license to fight Terrell in Illinois?

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.426
Yes.

01:08:02.509 --> 01:08:04.762
Then are you prepared
to apologize...

01:08:04.845 --> 01:08:07.557
about your unpatriotic remarks
about the war?

01:08:16.984 --> 01:08:19.654
- You say you're the people's champion.
- Yes, sir.

01:08:19.738 --> 01:08:22.242
Do you think you're acting
like the people's champion?

01:08:22.325 --> 01:08:25.370
Yes, sir.
I'm not gonna apologize to you.

01:08:25.453 --> 01:08:29.000
This is not a courtroom, and I do not
have to answer your questions.

01:08:37.928 --> 01:08:40.805
- What about Terrell?
- We'll fight in another state!

01:08:40.848 --> 01:08:43.267
- Are you gonna dodge the draft?
- I ain't draft-dodgin'...

01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:45.812
I ain't burnin' no flag,
and I ain't runnin' to Canada.

01:08:45.895 --> 01:08:48.858
I'm stayin' right here.
You wanna send me to jail?

01:08:48.941 --> 01:08:51.236
Fine. You go right ahead.
I've been in jail for 400 years.

01:08:51.319 --> 01:08:53.238
I can be there
for four or five more.

01:08:53.321 --> 01:08:55.241
But I ain't going'
no 10,000 miles...

01:08:55.323 --> 01:08:57.827
to help murder and kill
other poor people.

01:08:57.910 --> 01:09:02.207
If I wanna die, I'll die right here
right now, fightin' you, if I wanna die.

01:09:02.291 --> 01:09:06.212
You my enemy. Not no Chinese,
no Vietcong, no Japanese.

01:09:06.296 --> 01:09:08.340
You my opposer
when I want freedom.

01:09:08.423 --> 01:09:12.136
You my opposer when I want justice.
You my opposer when I want equality.

01:09:12.220 --> 01:09:13.930
You want me to go somewhere
and fight for you.

01:09:14.014 --> 01:09:16.015
You won't even stand up for me
right here in America...

01:09:16.058 --> 01:09:18.018
for my rights
and my religious beliefs.

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:20.395
You won't even stand up for me
right here at home.

01:09:22.899 --> 01:09:24.984
- Which guy you want to go first?
- You, sir.

01:09:25.069 --> 01:09:28.031
Tell Clay he gettin' on after me.
I'm the champ.

01:09:28.073 --> 01:09:30.951
- What?
- I said you can get on after me.

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:33.703
- No. What'd you call me?
- I called you Clay.

01:09:33.787 --> 01:09:36.374
You will announce it from right here,
from flat on your back.

01:09:36.416 --> 01:09:38.460
What's my name?
What's my name?

01:09:40.337 --> 01:09:44.384
What's my name? Say my name!
You gonna say my name!

01:09:44.426 --> 01:09:47.095
Your mama called you Clay!
I'm gonna call you Clay!

01:09:47.179 --> 01:09:49.224
I want you all to tell
all their aunts...

01:09:49.265 --> 01:09:51.268
and all their uncles
and cousins and friends...

01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:53.812
get to your television set,
get to your radio...

01:09:53.895 --> 01:09:56.441
'cause I never wanted
to whup a man so bad!

01:10:10.541 --> 01:10:13.336
What's my name?
What's my name?

01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:13.118
What's my name, motherfucker?
What's my name?

01:11:16.039 --> 01:11:18.124
What's my name?

01:11:37.899 --> 01:11:40.193
The jury has found you guilty
of refusing induction...

01:11:40.277 --> 01:11:43.572
into the United States
Armed Forces.

01:11:43.656 --> 01:11:45.700
Does the defense have anything
it wants to say?

01:11:45.783 --> 01:11:49.204
Yeah, I'd appreciate if the court would
just give me my sentence right now...

01:11:49.246 --> 01:11:52.583
rather than waitin' and stallin'.

01:11:52.667 --> 01:11:54.210
Very well.

01:11:56.964 --> 01:12:00.426
I sentence you to
the maximum sentence allowable:

01:12:00.468 --> 01:12:03.722
Five years imprisonment
and a fine of $10,000.

01:12:05.307 --> 01:12:07.393
Doubtless your lawyer
will lodge an appeal...

01:12:07.435 --> 01:12:10.731
so while you're free on bond, I order
that your passport be surrendered.

01:12:11.523 --> 01:12:16.238
I'll not have you benefiting yourself
by fighting abroad.

01:12:16.279 --> 01:12:18.407
This court is adjourned.

01:12:57.997 --> 01:12:58.039
Hold on. Watch this.
I've been working on this at home.

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:01.627
Hold on. Watch this.
I've been working on this at home.

01:13:01.668 --> 01:13:03.713
Just relax.

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:07.175
See? 'Cause it's spooky and sometimes
people get scared and run.

01:13:07.217 --> 01:13:09.470
Pay attention.
This is very spooky.

01:13:12.140 --> 01:13:14.476
Go ahead.
Blow on that for me.

01:13:20.567 --> 01:13:22.486
See, you don't need
to fight no more.

01:13:26.282 --> 01:13:28.868
You don't remember me, do you?

01:13:30.746 --> 01:13:34.959
Yeah. I remember somethin'.
What's your name?

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:37.337
- You know my name.
- I know your name.

01:13:37.421 --> 01:13:40.842
You came to my school
right before you won the title.

01:13:40.883 --> 01:13:43.553
I interviewed you
for my school paper.

01:13:43.637 --> 01:13:45.848
I was eleven.

01:13:46.932 --> 01:13:49.352
You had a long braid.

01:13:49.394 --> 01:13:51.396
Yeah.

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.358
- You called me "Little Indian Girl."
- Wow.

01:13:55.735 --> 01:13:57.862
- Man, that was you.
- That was me.

01:13:59.114 --> 01:14:02.410
And I loved you then,
just like all them kids did.

01:14:02.493 --> 01:14:04.746
I never stopped.
I still do.

01:15:09.659 --> 01:15:11.995
Hey, did you see
that Ellis-Quary fight?

01:15:12.079 --> 01:15:13.956
Yeah.

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.171
We're gonna be in front of
the US Court of Appeals next month.

01:15:19.254 --> 01:15:20.297
We're gonna lose.

01:15:20.339 --> 01:15:23.301
- We'll appeal to the Supreme Court.
- Jimmy Ellis, the champ.

01:15:23.343 --> 01:15:26.054
Man, I've been whupping on that boy
since I was 1 6.

01:15:26.138 --> 01:15:28.766
All that's gonna happen,
they gonna give Ellis to Frazier...

01:15:28.849 --> 01:15:31.478
Frazier's gonna kill him,
then what?

01:15:31.519 --> 01:15:34.606
Where's the gate?
Then they got to let me fight.

01:15:36.025 --> 01:15:39.988
Jimmy Ellis.
Fight that boy in a phone booth.

01:15:40.071 --> 01:15:44.076
Fight him in the middle of Times Square.
You think that'd draw a crowd?

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:47.706
Champ, draw a crowd
or not draw a crowd...

01:15:47.789 --> 01:15:50.501
it's not gonna make a difference
with your boxing licenses.

01:15:54.089 --> 01:15:56.842
The ACLU's handling your case
against the New York Boxing Commission.

01:15:56.925 --> 01:15:59.679
They've discovered that New York's
got actual ex-murderers...

01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:02.349
and ex-rapists
currently licensed to fight.

01:16:02.432 --> 01:16:04.894
But revoke yours?

01:16:04.935 --> 01:16:08.189
They don't want you to fight.

01:16:08.273 --> 01:16:09.608
- Tijuana.
- No.

01:16:09.691 --> 01:16:12.570
State Department refuses permission
for the one-hour visa.

01:16:12.611 --> 01:16:15.365
No fight in Tijuana.
Look...

01:16:15.448 --> 01:16:18.827
Can't fight here.
Can't fight outside the country.

01:16:18.911 --> 01:16:20.830
I know people
in the restaurant business.

01:16:20.913 --> 01:16:23.416
They want to start a chain.
Muhammad Ali Champ Burgers.

01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.836
Muhammad Malts,
Fistful of Fries.

01:16:25.919 --> 01:16:27.755
All of that.

01:16:27.838 --> 01:16:29.883
Why do I wanna be
in the restaurant business?

01:16:29.924 --> 01:16:31.218
'Cause you need the money.

01:16:31.301 --> 01:16:34.221
- How much all this gonna cost?
- Too much.

01:16:36.057 --> 01:16:38.435
They do that to you too, you know.

01:16:38.518 --> 01:16:40.479
They bust you out.

01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:54.621
All right.

01:16:58.626 --> 01:17:01.129
Go get me some Champ Burgers.

01:17:11.517 --> 01:17:13.478
Did y'all see that?
That man just hit me.

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:17.066
Oh, you done messed up now, sucka.
You done messed up...

01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:19.444
I don't wanna do nothin'
in front of your daughters, though.

01:17:19.485 --> 01:17:21.655
I can't beat you up
in front of your daughters.

01:17:21.738 --> 01:17:25.534
- Hey, champ, good to see you.
- All right, ladies. Take care now.

01:17:25.618 --> 01:17:27.662
All right now.
All right now.

01:17:38.550 --> 01:17:42.180
You called me "Little Indian Girl"
'cause I wore my hair in a braid.

01:17:44.558 --> 01:17:46.518
And then I said,
"Man, you scribble.

01:17:47.979 --> 01:17:49.606
You can't even write.

01:17:49.689 --> 01:17:52.150
Need to go back to school
till you learn how to do it better."

01:17:52.192 --> 01:17:55.613
Now, why you just havin'
a fresh mouth talkin' to me.

01:17:55.696 --> 01:17:57.657
So you think that's funny, huh?

01:17:57.741 --> 01:18:00.536
Telling me I can't write,
that I scribble.

01:18:01.287 --> 01:18:03.456
Now you wanna try
to make up with me.

01:18:03.539 --> 01:18:06.668
- This will make everything better.
- Shut up.

01:18:25.441 --> 01:18:28.028
Mommy and Daddy
moved to Mexico!

01:18:46.133 --> 01:18:48.094
Come on, baby.

01:18:49.179 --> 01:18:51.306
Oh, sweetie, come on.

01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:08.578
We will give you five minutes
to leave this area.

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:14.627
Who is the heavyweight champion
of the world?

01:19:26.016 --> 01:19:28.018
What's happenin'?

01:19:42.953 --> 01:19:45.415
- Hey, man.
- We lost on the appellate level...

01:19:45.498 --> 01:19:46.708
in New Orleans.

01:19:46.791 --> 01:19:49.628
- We're heading to the Supreme Court.
- We already got turned down there.

01:19:49.670 --> 01:19:54.467
I'm petitioning on a conscientious
objection basis. Religious belief.

01:19:54.551 --> 01:19:57.721
I believe that they'll hear that.

01:19:57.805 --> 01:20:00.809
Where the money
gonna come from, Chauncey?

01:20:00.892 --> 01:20:04.563
Herbert say I'm runnin' on empty.
Now, just put aside...

01:20:04.647 --> 01:20:06.399
"How did that happen?"

01:20:06.482 --> 01:20:11.321
License all revoked, passport gone,
can't fight here, can't fight nowhere.

01:20:11.405 --> 01:20:13.491
Then what happen if I lose
at the Supreme Court?

01:20:15.994 --> 01:20:18.288
Then you go to jail for five years.

01:21:34.006 --> 01:21:36.760
Oh, I saw Bundini
when I was in Europe.

01:21:36.843 --> 01:21:41.307
- Yeah? How is he?
- He's bad. He's in bad shape, man.

01:21:41.349 --> 01:21:44.269
You better get your belt back

01:21:48.441 --> 01:21:51.236
Look at this.

01:21:51.319 --> 01:21:53.781
Joe Frazier.
He can't up no gate.

01:21:53.822 --> 01:21:56.868
Can't fill no arena.
They got to let me fight.

01:21:56.951 --> 01:21:58.495
Fight.

01:22:01.874 --> 01:22:07.214
If that happens, promise me you? ll
put some new people around you.

01:22:10.009 --> 01:22:11.886
What you talkin' about?

01:22:13.054 --> 01:22:15.307
Where Herbert and them
when we need 'em?

01:22:15.349 --> 01:22:19.688
Gene Kilroy's dropping off groceries
like charity.

01:22:21.899 --> 01:22:25.069
We borrow money from my folks.

01:22:25.153 --> 01:22:29.575
They're all over you when you got it,
and then they just drop off you...

01:22:29.658 --> 01:22:31.327
when you don't.

01:22:43.801 --> 01:22:46.721
Norton, he's big and strong,
but he ain't nothin'.

01:22:46.804 --> 01:22:50.017
Hold on a second, Joe.
They're telling me we have a caller.

01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:53.437
- Go ahead, please.
- Cosell, this is Muhammad Ali.

01:22:53.521 --> 01:22:54.772
It's Muhammad Ali.

01:22:54.856 --> 01:22:56.942
Everybody knows
that I am the champ.

01:22:57.025 --> 01:23:00.404
The crown is a lie. I know it's a lie.
Joe Frazier knows it's a lie.

01:23:00.488 --> 01:23:02.866
And it's time for everybody
to stop lying and tell the truth.

01:23:02.907 --> 01:23:06.287
Let's tell it like it is.
With your court and boxingproblems...

01:23:06.370 --> 01:23:08.372
can you get a fight promoted?

01:23:08.456 --> 01:23:10.667
I would fight Joe Frazier for free
in a phone booth...

01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:13.128
in the middle of Times Square
if I wasn't broke.

01:23:13.212 --> 01:23:15.381
Did you say you were broke?
How can you be broke?

01:23:15.464 --> 01:23:18.927
You made more money than all previous
heavyweights champions combined.

01:23:18.969 --> 01:23:21.514
What about your management?
Surely they have provided for you.

01:23:21.597 --> 01:23:24.726
All I'm trying to say is it's time
for everybody to stop lyin'.

01:23:24.809 --> 01:23:26.520
Muhammad Ali is the champ.

01:23:26.603 --> 01:23:29.649
Get my son Herbert
on the telephone.

01:23:29.732 --> 01:23:32.569
Muhammad, thank you for calling in.
I'll relay that to Joe.

01:23:32.611 --> 01:23:36.782
And tell Joe I said
he is very ugly.

01:23:38.201 --> 01:23:41.413
Muhammad says that he will
fight you anywhere, anytime...

01:23:41.496 --> 01:23:46.252
and that the championship really is his
until that battle ensues.

01:23:59.477 --> 01:24:02.898
Mr. Ali has sporting blood.

01:24:02.981 --> 01:24:06.068
Mr. Ali wants a place
in this sports world.

01:24:06.152 --> 01:24:08.905
He loves it too much.

01:24:08.989 --> 01:24:13.452
I am therefore suspending Mr. Ali
from the practice of Islam.

01:24:13.536 --> 01:24:17.708
He may no longer appear in temple,
pray or teach...

01:24:17.791 --> 01:24:22.839
or have any conversation
with any Muslim whatsoever.

01:24:26.510 --> 01:24:28.095
Why didn? t you call
an ambulance or a doctor?

01:24:28.179 --> 01:24:30.807
Because he gave me your number
when he checked in.

01:24:30.849 --> 01:24:33.060
Normally, he's up there
making a lot of noise.

01:24:33.143 --> 01:24:35.605
But now he hasn't answered the door
in three days.

01:24:39.067 --> 01:24:40.819
- What's that?
- It's daylight.

01:24:42.363 --> 01:24:44.324
Get me that short dog.

01:24:46.827 --> 01:24:49.163
Give it to me.

01:24:51.875 --> 01:24:53.001
What's wrong with you?

01:24:53.043 --> 01:24:55.921
Ain't nothin' wrong with me.
My head ain't bad.

01:24:56.005 --> 01:24:57.924
- Leave me alone.
- Leave you alone. You called me!

01:24:58.007 --> 01:25:00.594
Yes, but that was a week ago.

01:25:00.677 --> 01:25:02.888
- Why are you shamin' yourself?
- Let me go, man.

01:25:02.972 --> 01:25:04.724
Why you doin' that to yourself?

01:25:04.807 --> 01:25:07.519
- Why you shamin' yourself?
- Ain't nobody shamed.

01:25:07.561 --> 01:25:09.855
Ain't nothin' wrong with me.

01:25:09.897 --> 01:25:11.732
I'm flyin'.

01:25:11.816 --> 01:25:13.902
The Sky Chief talk through me.
I know the word.

01:25:13.985 --> 01:25:15.362
- You know low.
- Yeah?

01:25:15.404 --> 01:25:17.656
I know low where the king
is goin' back to his throne!

01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:20.535
- From the root to the fruit!
- Them rhymes is old, Bundini.

01:25:20.577 --> 01:25:22.537
You need to get some new ones.

01:25:26.417 --> 01:25:30.255
God don't care about you.
Don't care about me.

01:25:30.339 --> 01:25:33.551
In all of everything, we don't mean
nothin'. He don't owe us.

01:25:33.634 --> 01:25:35.345
We be.

01:25:35.428 --> 01:25:38.724
And that's the onliest thing He did.

01:25:38.807 --> 01:25:41.894
But that's good.
That's why we free.

01:25:41.936 --> 01:25:45.774
But free ain't easy. Free is real
and real is a motherfucker.

01:25:48.027 --> 01:25:50.780
It eats raw meat.

01:25:50.864 --> 01:25:53.409
It walk in its own shoes.

01:25:53.492 --> 01:25:55.953
It don't ever waiver.

01:25:56.037 --> 01:25:57.497
Yeah.

01:26:03.463 --> 01:26:06.341
I... I sold your belt.

01:26:07.718 --> 01:26:10.680
I sold your belt to a barber
for $500 on Lenox Avenue.

01:26:10.763 --> 01:26:14.268
That's how low I did you.
I couldn't help it. I got a crazy mind.

01:26:16.562 --> 01:26:18.690
That belt say you the heavyweight
boxing champion of the world...

01:26:18.773 --> 01:26:21.693
and I took that $500...

01:26:21.777 --> 01:26:24.196
and I put it in my arm.

01:26:26.032 --> 01:26:28.076
That's what I called to tell you.

01:26:35.335 --> 01:26:38.631
I heard about the Nation stuff,
the courtroom.

01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:42.511
What you gonna do?

01:26:53.524 --> 01:26:55.360
Take me back.

01:27:03.787 --> 01:27:06.957
I could go down there and get the belt.
I can go get the belt.

01:27:46.798 --> 01:27:48.759
Hey, champ.

01:28:22.342 --> 01:28:28.266
$1,000 to the man that bring me
Howard Cosell's toupee dead or alive!

01:28:28.307 --> 01:28:30.936
Don't bother me.
I'm a world-famous sportscaster...

01:28:30.977 --> 01:28:33.272
and you're an ex-champion
with diminished skills.

01:28:33.355 --> 01:28:35.107
I can't be seen with you.

01:28:38.486 --> 01:28:41.282
- How's it goin', champ?
- Pretty good, man.

01:28:47.039 --> 01:28:50.376
Muhammad, I'd do anything for you.
You know that.

01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:55.925
But I've got bosses who only
give a damn about Nielsen ratings.

01:28:56.008 --> 01:28:58.636
I guarantee...

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:02.516
it will be a historical
and a momentous night.

01:29:08.565 --> 01:29:11.986
If they came to me tomorrow and say,
"We want you to fight Joe Frazier.

01:29:12.028 --> 01:29:15.031
Madison Square Garden.
Millions and millions of dollars.

01:29:15.073 --> 01:29:17.660
Here's your license back."
I will tell them...

01:29:17.743 --> 01:29:19.495
"I will never fight again."

01:29:19.579 --> 01:29:23.041
Frankly, Muhammad, I'm surprised,
because unless you...

01:29:23.083 --> 01:29:25.544
or until you fight Frazier...

01:29:25.628 --> 01:29:29.591
Cosell, are you losin' your hearing
along with your hair?

01:29:29.674 --> 01:29:32.720
Don't put no question to it, man.
I done told you, I'm through fightin'.

01:29:32.803 --> 01:29:35.181
I got a much bigger contender,
a much heavier opponent.

01:29:35.265 --> 01:29:37.184
I'm fightin'
the entire US government.

01:29:38.435 --> 01:29:40.938
Do you think
you're going to jail?

01:29:41.022 --> 01:29:43.692
I don't know. I don't know.

01:29:43.733 --> 01:29:49.365
Joe Frazier told me on this show
that he could knock you out.

01:29:49.407 --> 01:29:51.701
See, there you go agitatin'.

01:29:51.743 --> 01:29:55.623
You should've asked Smokin' Joe
what have he been smokin'?

01:29:55.706 --> 01:29:59.461
That boy even dream he whupped me,
he better wake up and apologize.

01:29:59.544 --> 01:30:01.589
If I was to get in the ring with Joe...

01:30:01.672 --> 01:30:03.591
here's what you might see.

01:30:03.675 --> 01:30:08.389
Ali comes out to meet Frazier,
but Frazier starts to retreat.

01:30:08.430 --> 01:30:12.686
If Joe goes back an inch farther,
he'll wind up in a ringside seat.

01:30:12.769 --> 01:30:15.898
Ali swings with his left,
Ali swings with his right.

01:30:15.981 --> 01:30:18.151
Just look at the kid
carry the fight.

01:30:18.234 --> 01:30:20.821
Frazier keeps backin',
but there's not enough room.

01:30:20.904 --> 01:30:24.367
It's only a matter of time
before Ali lowers the boom.

01:30:24.450 --> 01:30:27.245
Ali swings with his right.
What a beautiful swing.

01:30:27.329 --> 01:30:30.249
But the punch lifts Frazier
clean out of the ring.

01:30:30.291 --> 01:30:33.086
Frazier's still risin',
and the referee wears a frown...

01:30:33.169 --> 01:30:36.548
'cause he can't start countin'
till Frazier comes down.

01:30:36.632 --> 01:30:39.969
Frazier's disappeared from view.
The crowd is getting frantic.

01:30:40.053 --> 01:30:44.016
But our radar stations picked him up.
He's somewhere over the Atlantic.

01:30:44.099 --> 01:30:46.352
Now, who would've thought
when they came to the fight...

01:30:46.435 --> 01:30:50.399
they was gonna witness the launchin'
of a black satellite.

01:30:50.482 --> 01:30:52.985
But don't wait for that fight.

01:30:53.069 --> 01:30:55.238
It ain't never gonna happen.

01:30:55.321 --> 01:30:57.407
Only thing you could do...

01:30:57.491 --> 01:31:00.995
is wonder and imagine.

01:31:01.579 --> 01:31:07.420
This has been another
sports exclusive from ABC.

01:31:07.503 --> 01:31:09.505
- Two. Go two.
- Over to Jim McKay...

01:31:09.589 --> 01:31:11.842
in Bern, Switzerland.

01:31:11.925 --> 01:31:14.136
- How you gonna go from me to Jim McKay?
- Listen, uh...

01:31:15.346 --> 01:31:19.017
- Did your wife leave you yet?
- No, she hasn't left me yet.

01:31:19.101 --> 01:31:21.437
She's going to, 'cause I
told your wife when I seen her...

01:31:21.520 --> 01:31:24.774
I said, "Listen, why you
doin' this to yourself?"

01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:37.498
Oh, man, Joe.
Who dresses you?

01:31:37.582 --> 01:31:40.460
You look like the heavyweight
champion of pimps.

01:31:40.544 --> 01:31:42.588
Hey, shut up and get in.

01:31:43.881 --> 01:31:45.425
That jacket? s a mess, man.

01:31:49.722 --> 01:31:52.225
What you in Philly for?
Philly's my town.

01:31:52.308 --> 01:31:55.312
Well, I just wanted to get
a little closer to you, honey.

01:31:55.395 --> 01:31:56.396
Man, fuck you.

01:31:58.733 --> 01:32:02.195
There'll be two undefeated heavyweight
champions, and they ain't fightin'.

01:32:02.237 --> 01:32:04.949
- What about your license?
- I can fight in Atlanta.

01:32:05.032 --> 01:32:07.702
There ain't no state boxing commission
in Georgia.

01:32:07.744 --> 01:32:11.039
It's all set. I do a prelim in Atlanta
against Jerry Quary...

01:32:11.081 --> 01:32:13.709
but we got to get this
steamroller movin' right now.

01:32:13.751 --> 01:32:15.378
So what do I have to do?

01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:18.841
All you got to do is announce
that after I whup Jerry Quary...

01:32:18.924 --> 01:32:21.427
you gonna give me a title shot.

01:32:21.511 --> 01:32:24.139
Come on, man.
Say it! Say it!

01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:36.404
What I got and all I got,
I got with these right here.

01:32:36.487 --> 01:32:38.740
Hell, man, I already got the title.

01:32:38.824 --> 01:32:43.371
So I ain't got nothin' to win,
but I got eveythin' to lose.

01:32:44.956 --> 01:32:47.334
Yeah, but you know
you ain't the real champ yet.

01:32:56.470 --> 01:32:58.598
You beat Quary...

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:01.768
I'm gonna get you in the ring.
I'm gonna kick your ass.

01:33:12.698 --> 01:33:15.076
By the way...

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:19.540
you need any money
or anything to tide you by?

01:33:20.959 --> 01:33:22.878
No, I'm fine.

01:33:37.813 --> 01:33:40.274
Time!

01:33:47.825 --> 01:33:50.453
What you want?

01:33:52.998 --> 01:33:54.959
Take me back, boss.

01:33:56.711 --> 01:33:58.630
I'm clean.

01:33:58.713 --> 01:34:03.094
This is a resurrection.
This is God's act.

01:34:03.177 --> 01:34:06.348
And the prophet is goin' home.

01:34:06.431 --> 01:34:08.767
Take me with you, boss.

01:34:09.810 --> 01:34:11.896
I'll do anything.

01:34:22.409 --> 01:34:26.289
Your hands can't hit
what your eyes can't see.

01:34:29.293 --> 01:34:33.131
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

01:34:33.214 --> 01:34:35.634
Rumble, young man, rumble.

01:34:54.031 --> 01:34:54.198
God ain't watching'!
Ain't nobody but us!

01:34:54.199 --> 01:34:57.744
God ain't watching'!
Ain't nobody but us!

01:35:04.878 --> 01:35:07.715
There it is!
Stay in his face!

01:35:11.595 --> 01:35:13.430
Go, Muhammad!

01:35:24.944 --> 01:35:26.279
There it is!

01:35:32.495 --> 01:35:34.081
Now for the right. Boom!

01:35:40.463 --> 01:35:42.424
Prophet is goin' home
to the throne.

01:35:59.237 --> 01:36:01.448
That's how you do it, Ali.

01:36:01.531 --> 01:36:03.784
That's how you do it.

01:36:10.876 --> 01:36:13.462
You okay?
You're a goddamn Superman.

01:36:13.546 --> 01:36:15.799
Ain't no kryptonite
in this ring tonight.

01:37:00.186 --> 01:37:02.397
- We want Joe Frazier!
- We want him!

01:37:02.481 --> 01:37:07.028
- We want Joe Frazier!
- And you deserve it. You deserve it.

01:37:10.741 --> 01:37:13.786
This prophet is comin' home,
goin' from the darkness to the light.

01:37:16.582 --> 01:37:18.834
Soak it in this
for about 20 minutes.

01:37:20.962 --> 01:37:23.799
We don't need their management.

01:37:24.758 --> 01:37:28.137
Hey, Herbert, we did good.
Doin' good tonight.

01:37:39.818 --> 01:37:41.571
All praise to Allah.

01:37:45.117 --> 01:37:47.661
The messenger has lifted
your suspension.

01:37:47.745 --> 01:37:49.664
Congratulations.

01:37:49.747 --> 01:37:51.750
So you? re sayin'
I can be a Muslim again.

01:37:51.833 --> 01:37:53.419
- Yes.
- I ain't never stopped.

01:37:53.502 --> 01:37:55.463
Just like I ain't never stopped
bein' the champ.

01:37:57.674 --> 01:37:59.342
I begged my father
to reinstate you.

01:37:59.426 --> 01:38:02.221
When? When you do that, Herbert?

01:38:02.304 --> 01:38:04.724
After I promoted this Quary fight
or after I won it?

01:38:05.684 --> 01:38:07.728
- We can get Frazier.
- Man, I done already got Frazier.

01:38:07.811 --> 01:38:10.273
We can get $5 million for Frazier.

01:38:10.356 --> 01:38:13.485
We talkin' management,
talkin' money or talkin' religion?

01:38:13.527 --> 01:38:16.530
When I got leery
and talked up why I'm broke...

01:38:16.614 --> 01:38:18.157
then come the suspension.

01:38:18.241 --> 01:38:21.787
Now you explain that one to me,
my brother.

01:38:21.870 --> 01:38:24.039
That was my father.

01:38:26.584 --> 01:38:28.545
Your father.

01:38:28.587 --> 01:38:32.717
I love your father, Herbert.
I swear, man. I love the Nation.

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:35.262
But it don't own me.

01:38:44.398 --> 01:38:47.151
You go on out there
and you make that Frazier deal.

01:38:52.408 --> 01:38:54.327
My brother.
Yeah, your brother Herbert.

01:38:54.410 --> 01:38:56.287
Go on somewhere,
make that deal.

01:39:06.884 --> 01:39:10.180
And he accepts me.
I? m Jewish, but yet he's Muslim...

01:39:10.263 --> 01:39:11.723
and we still get along.

01:39:11.807 --> 01:39:15.311
He understands me. He understands me
and he still allows me to hang with him.

01:39:15.394 --> 01:39:18.857
He knows I like pork and white women,
but still allows me to be here with him.

01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:20.901
Now, I can give up pork...

01:39:20.943 --> 01:39:23.738
but them white women,
goddamn it!

01:39:23.821 --> 01:39:25.865
How you deal with it, boy?

01:39:39.758 --> 01:39:43.053
Hello?
Muhammad, it's for you.

01:39:47.517 --> 01:39:49.728
Thank you, Lana.

01:39:49.812 --> 01:39:52.940
- Yeah?
- Muhammad? Howard Cosell.

01:39:52.982 --> 01:39:56.612
- You TKO'd them.
- Hey, what you talkin' about, Howard?

01:39:56.695 --> 01:39:58.697
- With Quary?
- No.

01:39:58.781 --> 01:40:00.700
The Supreme Court ruled today...

01:40:00.783 --> 01:40:04.121
in the case of The United States
vs. Cassius Clay...

01:40:04.163 --> 01:40:07.959
aka Muhammad Ali.

01:40:08.042 --> 01:40:12.006
You won an eight-to-zero
unanimous decision.

01:40:12.047 --> 01:40:14.884
You're free.

01:40:14.967 --> 01:40:16.928
Congratulations.

01:40:33.323 --> 01:40:34.784
I'm free.

01:40:40.707 --> 01:40:42.626
The Supreme Court
just set me free.

01:40:47.507 --> 01:40:49.969
What are you talkin' about?

01:40:51.304 --> 01:40:52.806
Eight-to-oh, unanimous decision.

01:40:52.889 --> 01:40:55.601
The Supreme Court
just overturned my conviction.

01:40:57.395 --> 01:41:00.106
- Yes!
- All right. All right.

01:41:00.190 --> 01:41:01.650
- Did we get 'em, Ali?
- We got 'em, man.

01:41:03.569 --> 01:41:05.697
Hey, man.

01:41:07.073 --> 01:41:10.494
- Did we do it?
- We did it, man.

01:41:10.578 --> 01:41:14.040
They wanna be on your side now because
the truth has shown itself to the power.

01:41:14.124 --> 01:41:16.960
Now the power's comin' to the truth.
That's what it is.

01:41:17.044 --> 01:41:19.463
And the truth tastes good
when there's a belly full of lies.

01:41:19.547 --> 01:41:22.676
- What you talkin' about?
- It don't matter. It don't matter.

01:41:31.478 --> 01:41:34.190
Ladies and gentlemen,
1 5 rounds of boxing...

01:41:34.273 --> 01:41:38.987
for the undisputed heavyweight
championship of the world.

01:41:39.071 --> 01:41:43.952
In this corner, the contender and former
heavyweight champion of the world...

01:41:44.035 --> 01:41:48.207
weighing in at 21 3 pounds...

01:41:48.291 --> 01:41:52.129
with a record of31 and 0
with 25 knockouts...

01:41:52.212 --> 01:41:54.882
Muhammad Ali!

01:42:00.305 --> 01:42:05.019
His opponent,
weighing in at 2051/2 pounds...

01:42:05.103 --> 01:42:09.233
with a record of26 and 0
with 23 knockouts...

01:42:09.316 --> 01:42:12.862
the current heavyweight
champion of the world...

01:42:12.946 --> 01:42:17.201
Smokin? Joe Frazier!

01:42:19.245 --> 01:42:22.666
I want a good, clean fight.
Protect your self at all times.

01:42:22.750 --> 01:42:25.962
Gentlemen, touch gloves.
Good luck to both of you.

01:43:04.801 --> 01:43:05.969
Come on!

01:43:06.053 --> 01:43:08.055
Stick him! Come on!

01:43:50.691 --> 01:43:52.777
That's okay, champ.
Don't stop fightin'.

01:43:54.863 --> 01:43:56.156
What's comin'?

01:43:56.239 --> 01:43:59.577
Lean back, man.
Move back. Work, legs.

01:44:12.134 --> 01:44:13.344
Ain't nobody hurt.

01:44:13.427 --> 01:44:15.889
That's all right.
Ain't no...

01:44:33.827 --> 01:44:35.204
Keep puttin' out.
Come on.

01:44:47.010 --> 01:44:49.805
- Move, Ali!
- Back, back, back!

01:45:23.138 --> 01:45:25.057
Muhammad, you said
you were gonna win the fight.

01:45:25.140 --> 01:45:27.143
How do you account
for the beating you've taken?

01:45:27.226 --> 01:45:29.938
- Did he hurt you?
- Joe said you don't wanna fight again.

01:45:30.021 --> 01:45:32.566
Oh, how wrong he is.

01:45:32.650 --> 01:45:34.193
- Why would it be different?
- Muhammad, wait!

01:45:39.283 --> 01:45:42.578
- But I wanna ask him something!
- We all wanna ask him something.

01:45:42.662 --> 01:45:45.248
- Sons of bitches! Get outta here!
- When are you gonna get a hairpiece?

01:45:45.332 --> 01:45:47.334
Don't worry about it.
You lost all of yours.

01:45:47.418 --> 01:45:49.379
You cue ball head motherfucker.
Get outta here!

01:45:49.420 --> 01:45:51.798
- Just one more question.
- Let me talk to him.

01:45:51.882 --> 01:45:54.134
We're close to the start
of round one.

01:45:54.218 --> 01:45:56.053
Now that Smokin? Joe
done run outta tomato cans...

01:45:56.137 --> 01:45:59.725
I got Yank to commit to a rematch
with you in about six months.

01:45:59.766 --> 01:46:01.977
Frazier said he'd be happy
with three mil.

01:46:02.061 --> 01:46:06.483
I'll fly to Jamaica, get Yank to sign
right after Joe beats this big stiff.

01:46:07.943 --> 01:46:10.488
I think he hurt Joe Frazier.

01:46:10.571 --> 01:46:13.241
I think Joe is hurt.

01:46:13.283 --> 01:46:16.871
Down goes Frazier!
Down goes Frazier!

01:46:16.954 --> 01:46:18.748
- Down goes Frazier!
- Get up, Joe.

01:46:18.790 --> 01:46:22.377
The heavy weight champion is
taking the mandatory eightcount...

01:46:22.461 --> 01:46:25.423
and Foreman
i spoised as can be.

01:46:27.342 --> 01:46:29.803
Foreman is all over Frazier.

01:46:29.887 --> 01:46:32.223
And Frazier is down again!

01:46:32.306 --> 01:46:34.851
He maybe...
No, he's rising.

01:46:36.770 --> 01:46:38.105
It's over! It is over!

01:46:38.147 --> 01:46:41.484
It'd be easy to get a fight
with Frazier now.

01:46:41.568 --> 01:46:45.823
Only thing he's champion of
is gettin' knocked down.

01:46:45.906 --> 01:46:49.870
George Foreman is
the heavyweight champion of the world.

01:46:51.663 --> 01:46:55.627
The Rumble in the Jungle.
That is the name that I've given it.

01:46:55.710 --> 01:47:00.257
Muhammad Ali and George Foreman
in Kinshasa, Zaire.

01:47:00.341 --> 01:47:02.343
- Don, Zaire?
- Yeah, Don.

01:47:02.427 --> 01:47:04.805
I mean, why not Antarctica,
somethin' like that?

01:47:04.888 --> 01:47:06.974
What's wrong with New York City?

01:47:08.851 --> 01:47:10.895
Because you miss the significance.

01:47:10.979 --> 01:47:15.192
See, I dream of overcoming
400 years of racial depression...

01:47:15.276 --> 01:47:19.489
to the dawn of a new day of liberation,
financial and otherwise.

01:47:19.573 --> 01:47:22.702
It will raise up the spirits
of our inner cities.

01:47:22.785 --> 01:47:25.288
It will rise up and fill with hope,
the souls...

01:47:25.371 --> 01:47:27.958
the unrequited needs
of the black proletariat.

01:47:28.041 --> 01:47:30.878
That is, the discouraged, dispirited,
denigrated denizens...

01:47:30.962 --> 01:47:33.965
of the demimonde
that is called the ghetto.

01:47:34.049 --> 01:47:36.844
Man, Don, you crazy.

01:47:36.886 --> 01:47:40.849
You must've studied the whole
"D" section of the dictionary.

01:48:05.462 --> 01:48:07.381
Good morning, sister.

01:48:09.843 --> 01:48:11.512
Hi, brother.

01:48:13.514 --> 01:48:15.391
How you doin', champ?

01:48:42.591 --> 01:48:44.677
Why they saying that?
What they sayin'?

01:48:49.016 --> 01:48:51.102
What that mean?
I don't understand.

01:48:51.185 --> 01:48:52.729
- It means...
- What?

01:48:52.812 --> 01:48:56.233
It mean, "Ali, kill him.
Ali, kill him."

01:49:42.832 --> 01:49:45.585
The champ is here!

01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:49.465
Ladies and gentlemen, the heavyweight
champion of the world has arrived!

01:49:51.051 --> 01:49:53.095
The champ is here!

01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:00.312
Hey, man.

01:50:00.395 --> 01:50:02.523
He's quite younger than you.
How you feeling about that?

01:50:02.606 --> 01:50:05.276
He's quite younger than me?
Well, we quite younger than you.

01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:09.824
What you talkin' about? Thirty-two
years old. Best shape of my life.

01:51:07.269 --> 01:51:09.897
Hey, stop!
All right, back up.

01:51:16.697 --> 01:51:19.951
Did you see Muhammad Ali?

01:55:40.188 --> 01:55:43.734
- Here's your water.
- Oh, thank you, hon.

01:55:43.817 --> 01:55:47.238
Bottled water.
Frozen steaks.

01:55:47.322 --> 01:55:49.950
Brought all that stuffin
like Africa's ain't got no steaks.

01:55:50.033 --> 01:55:53.955
- You could pick up parasites.
- Mobutu eats it.

01:55:53.997 --> 01:55:56.583
Mobutu's takin' care of Mobutu.

01:55:56.667 --> 01:55:59.295
He steals all the wealth
and sends it to Switzerland.

01:56:00.671 --> 01:56:03.049
What that got to do
with any of why we here?

01:56:03.133 --> 01:56:08.514
We are here 'cause Don King
got Mobutu to put up $1 0 million.

01:56:08.598 --> 01:56:12.394
Don King don't care about Africa.
He's worse than Herbert.

01:56:13.103 --> 01:56:15.481
Here come Herbert.

01:56:15.565 --> 01:56:18.276
And Don King fit right in too.

01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:20.654
Now he's a dashiki-wearin' rip-off.

01:56:20.738 --> 01:56:22.740
Don King delivered the first-ever...

01:56:22.824 --> 01:56:25.076
black-promoted
championship fight in Africa.

01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:29.081
Don King talks black,
lives white and thinks green.

01:56:29.165 --> 01:56:31.501
And you're defending him
and Brother Herbert?

01:56:31.543 --> 01:56:34.505
'Cause clean-cut Muslims in a parade
on the South Side of Chicago...

01:56:34.546 --> 01:56:37.634
ain't gonna get this done!

01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:41.388
I got to put honkies with connections
and bad-ass niggas to it.

01:56:41.472 --> 01:56:43.391
And now they matched you up
against George Foreman.

01:56:43.474 --> 01:56:46.436
Do you think they give a damn
if you get killed?

01:56:52.777 --> 01:56:54.821
So that's what you think?

01:57:04.083 --> 01:57:07.086
I just wanna know why
my Muslim husband...

01:57:07.170 --> 01:57:10.215
is allowing himself
to get strung up on a cross.

01:57:10.299 --> 01:57:12.301
Just tell me why.

01:57:20.645 --> 01:57:22.314
Mayum's sick.

01:57:27.737 --> 01:57:30.657
Maybe I ought to go back
to Chicago and look after her?

01:57:33.577 --> 01:57:35.037
Sure.

01:57:41.838 --> 01:57:44.466
Well, then I guess
I'll be back before the fight.

01:57:46.009 --> 01:57:48.387
If that? s all right, my husband.

01:58:14.503 --> 01:58:16.463
This fight is no contest!

01:58:16.547 --> 01:58:18.508
He is entirely too slow to fight me.

01:58:18.591 --> 01:58:21.094
I say that George Foreman
is a mummy.

01:58:21.178 --> 01:58:24.056
He's too slow.
You know I name all my fighters.

01:58:24.139 --> 01:58:26.309
I'm gonna call George Foreman
"The Mummy."

01:58:26.351 --> 01:58:28.603
He fight like a mummy.

01:58:32.441 --> 01:58:35.278
And when I see George throwin' punches,
this is what I hear:

01:58:35.362 --> 01:58:37.740
Here come the left.

01:58:37.823 --> 01:58:40.076
Here come the right.

01:58:40.159 --> 01:58:42.829
But the mummy can't hit
what the mummy can't see...

01:58:42.913 --> 01:58:44.790
'cause I'm too fast for him.

01:58:46.375 --> 01:58:49.170
I'm too fast.

01:58:49.254 --> 01:58:53.217
I'm too fast. I'm too fast.
I move too good for him.

01:58:53.300 --> 01:58:56.304
I'll hit George Foreman so many times,
he'll think he's surrounded.

01:58:57.556 --> 01:59:00.976
He gonna say, "Call the police!
It's five of 'em in here!"

01:59:02.645 --> 01:59:04.856
I'm bad, man. I'm bad!

01:59:04.898 --> 01:59:08.778
Muhammad, I'm sorry.
I have to ask.

01:59:09.445 --> 01:59:11.489
Are you really
fast enough anymore...

01:59:11.573 --> 01:59:13.826
to beat George Foreman?

01:59:13.867 --> 01:59:18.707
If he gets you against the ropes,
he can knock you out with either hand.

01:59:18.748 --> 01:59:23.379
Many people believe you? re not the man
you used to be ten years ago.

01:59:26.424 --> 01:59:28.135
See, now, Howard...

01:59:28.218 --> 01:59:31.556
I didn't even want to talk
about this, man.

01:59:33.058 --> 01:59:36.854
Especially not out here
in front of all these people.

01:59:36.896 --> 01:59:39.566
But I talked to your wife...

01:59:39.649 --> 01:59:43.904
and she said you not the man
you used to be two years ago!

02:00:06.390 --> 02:00:08.351
Champ.

02:00:12.439 --> 02:00:15.360
- Champ, George had an accident.
- He... He had what?

02:00:15.443 --> 02:00:18.238
- What are you talking about?
- He got cut right above his right eye.

02:00:18.322 --> 02:00:20.825
His sparring partner's elbow
split it open.

02:00:20.908 --> 02:00:23.411
- Can he fight?
- Not for six weeks.

02:00:25.372 --> 02:00:27.458
This is not a humorous situation,
my champ.

02:00:27.541 --> 02:00:31.171
This postponement could be long,
especially if George leaves.

02:00:31.254 --> 02:00:33.465
You tying to
pull something here, Don?

02:00:33.549 --> 02:00:36.219
If George leaves, he ain't comin' back.
George don't like it here.

02:00:37.303 --> 02:00:40.933
How right you are, my suspicious
and short Italian brother.

02:00:40.974 --> 02:00:43.728
Look here, man,
my fiduciary responsibility...

02:00:43.811 --> 02:00:46.231
to this first all-black promotion...

02:00:46.314 --> 02:00:49.819
is analogous to a garden in the African
sun... it must grow, it must bloom.

02:00:49.902 --> 02:00:54.324
Cannot flower in the gloom and shade
of postponement to the Astrodome...

02:00:54.366 --> 02:00:57.161
or any dome out of Zaire where it be
deprivileged of light and bled of water.

02:00:57.203 --> 02:01:00.874
'Cause what gonna be bleedin' out of
there is money... a hemorrhage of cash.

02:01:00.957 --> 02:01:02.876
I'm talkin' about blood on the floor.

02:01:02.960 --> 02:01:06.464
Double hotel costs, airplane,
travel costs, food and beverage.

02:01:06.547 --> 02:01:10.427
- So what do you want us to do?
- Muhammad Ali. The people's champion.

02:01:10.511 --> 02:01:11.762
My black brother.

02:01:11.846 --> 02:01:14.641
I need you.
I need your strength.

02:01:14.724 --> 02:01:17.978
I need you to find a way
to get George to stay.

02:01:18.020 --> 02:01:20.440
Be Moses in reverse.

02:01:20.523 --> 02:01:24.611
Do not let my people go.
Keep them the fuck right here in Egypt.

02:01:24.695 --> 02:01:26.948
- If you? ll pardon my Swahili.
- Lingala.

02:01:27.031 --> 02:01:29.325
- Say what?
- They speak Lingala.

02:01:30.410 --> 02:01:33.789
Ali wants his title,
and he wants it in Zaire.

02:01:37.752 --> 02:01:40.464
Okay, all right, okay.
Let's take it back.

02:01:40.548 --> 02:01:43.718
George go, George go.
Hell, I can get you Joe Frazier.

02:01:43.802 --> 02:01:46.889
Ali-Frazier 3.
That's the fight everybody want to see.

02:01:46.972 --> 02:01:50.894
- We don't want Frazier, we want George.
- Hell, I don't control George Foreman.

02:02:33.947 --> 02:02:38.118
There's been an accidental injury
to George Foreman in training.

02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:39.954
The truth is...

02:02:40.037 --> 02:02:41.790
George knocked his self out.

02:02:42.832 --> 02:02:44.293
That's right.

02:02:44.334 --> 02:02:47.421
He did three rounds, realized
he was gonna lose to Muhammad Ali...

02:02:47.463 --> 02:02:48.923
and knocked his self out.

02:02:49.925 --> 02:02:52.678
I predict that when the fight is set,
he might not show.

02:02:52.761 --> 02:02:53.888
Oh, you bad.

02:02:53.971 --> 02:02:56.933
- That's right, I'm a bad man.
- Ain't no doubt about that.

02:02:57.017 --> 02:02:59.311
Yeah, but you tell George
the same thing.

02:02:59.394 --> 02:03:01.313
I heard you.
I been watching you.

02:03:01.397 --> 02:03:05.402
I know he's your man, I know you got
him picked, but the man is in trouble.

02:03:05.485 --> 02:03:08.531
The whole world was gonna know,
but now he ain't gonna show.

02:03:09.323 --> 02:03:12.494
In order to ensure that George is ready,
we are thinking of postponing...

02:03:12.536 --> 02:03:15.498
from September 24 to October 30.

02:03:15.581 --> 02:03:17.542
What about the concert?

02:03:17.625 --> 02:03:22.089
The concert will go on as planned.
Those dates are September 20, 21...

02:03:22.172 --> 02:03:26.469
I want all the helicopters guarded,
all the private planes, private boats.

02:03:26.511 --> 02:03:28.472
I'm serious.
I want the airports...

02:03:28.514 --> 02:03:30.725
I want President Mobutu
and all his paratroopers...

02:03:30.808 --> 02:03:33.561
All you Zaireans,
y'all be on guard too.

02:03:33.645 --> 02:03:37.274
Any strange boats creeping away,
they might be taking him out.

02:03:37.358 --> 02:03:38.734
Bus stations.

02:03:38.818 --> 02:03:40.320
And bus stations!

02:03:40.361 --> 02:03:42.322
Right.
Watch the bus stations.

02:03:42.364 --> 02:03:45.827
The elephant caravans... They might be
tying to take him out on an elephant.

02:03:45.910 --> 02:03:48.330
- What'd you say?
- Hell, I ain't talking to you.

02:03:48.371 --> 02:03:49.998
Hey. Hey, man.

02:03:51.083 --> 02:03:53.252
Don? t you never talk
to Angelo like that.

02:03:53.336 --> 02:03:57.007
Don? t you never talk to Angie
like that again.

02:03:57.049 --> 02:03:58.884
Something wrong with you, man?

02:04:00.511 --> 02:04:03.932
Think you callin' some shots here?
You ain't callin' nothin'.

02:04:05.935 --> 02:04:08.313
They all know.

02:04:08.396 --> 02:04:11.358
All them ladies out there,
they know I'm ready.

02:04:11.400 --> 02:04:14.612
I see fear in the eyes
of his followers.

02:04:14.695 --> 02:04:18.325
This was supposed to be the fight
that Muhammad Ali was ended.

02:04:18.408 --> 02:04:23.122
Supposed to be Muhammad was gonna fall.
Supposed to be my destruction.

02:04:23.206 --> 02:04:25.709
Well, they miscalculated.
They misjudged.

02:04:25.792 --> 02:04:27.419
They got it wrong.

02:04:50.448 --> 02:04:52.200
Hold on a second.

02:04:53.451 --> 02:04:54.578
What's your name?

02:04:56.080 --> 02:04:57.248
Veronica Porche.

02:04:57.289 --> 02:04:59.250
Porche. Like the sports car.

02:04:59.292 --> 02:05:02.254
- Yes.
- With just a little something extra.

02:05:02.296 --> 02:05:03.797
Hey, you with Don?

02:05:04.882 --> 02:05:08.678
Don brought me here,
but I'm not with anybody, no.

02:05:08.762 --> 02:05:11.140
- Where you come from?
- LA.

02:05:11.223 --> 02:05:13.559
- LA?
- But my people are from Louisiana.

02:05:13.643 --> 02:05:14.978
Louisiana.

02:05:15.061 --> 02:05:17.022
What, you Creole?

02:05:17.105 --> 02:05:22.153
We're Creole,
so I'm African, French and Spanish.

02:05:22.237 --> 02:05:24.281
My mother's grandfather was Jewish.

02:05:24.990 --> 02:05:28.286
Well, they mixed all that stuff up
in there real nice.

02:05:28.328 --> 02:05:31.206
I'm the only witch doctor here.
Bundini Brown.

02:05:31.289 --> 02:05:33.501
Bundini Brown
is an authentic witch doctor.

02:05:33.584 --> 02:05:36.504
- You tell 'em.
- The only one in the United States.

02:05:38.131 --> 02:05:41.510
I'm real glad
you said what you did.

02:05:41.552 --> 02:05:44.848
You made sure the fight stays here.

02:05:48.018 --> 02:05:51.106
You know all them reporters
and writers in there...

02:05:52.399 --> 02:05:54.860
they say George
is gonna kill me.

02:05:55.945 --> 02:05:57.321
What you think?

02:06:01.368 --> 02:06:03.371
Mr. Ali? Mr. Ali?

02:06:03.454 --> 02:06:05.540
- We want thank you.
- Hey, fella.

02:06:05.623 --> 02:06:07.501
Y'all wanna thank me?

02:06:08.710 --> 02:06:10.880
Y'all gonna thank me?
What I did?

02:06:13.884 --> 02:06:16.387
They thanking me for something.

02:06:16.470 --> 02:06:20.725
Hey, you ever been down to Hong Kong?
Thailand? Taiwan?

02:06:20.809 --> 02:06:23.729
- No.
- No? I can't go there.

02:06:24.396 --> 02:06:27.859
- Hi, Ruthie. How are you?
- Hi, champ.

02:06:30.529 --> 02:06:32.490
What's going on?
I'm great. How you feeling?

02:06:32.573 --> 02:06:34.909
When I go to sleep,
this closes up.

02:06:35.994 --> 02:06:39.415
That's what happens. When I go
to sleep, all this rests together.

02:06:39.498 --> 02:06:41.793
During the day, I got to think.

02:06:41.876 --> 02:06:45.255
Get me out of this county.
All the women so pretty.

02:06:45.339 --> 02:06:50.595
All of? em, they got hair come all
the way down to the back of their knees.

02:06:50.679 --> 02:06:54.266
All of? em... All of? em
about Veronica's complexion.

02:06:54.350 --> 02:06:56.728
Every single one of? em.
Bad, man.

02:06:58.397 --> 02:07:00.649
But ain't nothing like the sisters.

02:07:01.817 --> 02:07:04.613
Ain't nothing like the sisters.

02:07:08.451 --> 02:07:11.746
Come on. Why don't we go
take a ride or something?

02:07:11.788 --> 02:07:13.373
Wanna come with me?

02:07:23.219 --> 02:07:26.765
Ruth, tell us the truth.
Is this your kind of guy?

02:07:27.474 --> 02:07:29.143
More cushion for the pushin'.

02:07:32.438 --> 02:07:33.648
What'd he say?

02:07:34.983 --> 02:07:36.986
So why you so glad
we still here?

02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:44.161
Making the fight stay here
in Africa...

02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:49.501
Anybody can fight in Vegas.

02:07:55.383 --> 02:07:57.845
Well, that's one job.
I got two.

02:07:57.886 --> 02:07:59.847
Got to whup George.

02:08:08.024 --> 02:08:10.151
Islamic faith help you do that?

02:08:11.445 --> 02:08:15.199
Listen, girl, as a Muslim
I am failed in the eyes of God.

02:08:15.241 --> 02:08:19.538
I should've discovered Islam at 50,
'cause I'm weak on women.

02:08:20.789 --> 02:08:22.959
First they take my eyes.

02:08:23.042 --> 02:08:25.504
My heart follow.

02:08:25.545 --> 02:08:27.715
Making me the lovingest husband
in the world...

02:08:27.798 --> 02:08:30.718
and the most terriblest husband
at the same time.

02:08:33.347 --> 02:08:35.057
Look at you.

02:08:35.099 --> 02:08:37.477
Green eyes.

02:08:37.560 --> 02:08:39.354
Cocoa skin.

02:08:40.439 --> 02:08:42.733
Okay, rest of me, let's go.

02:08:50.701 --> 02:08:51.786
Rumble, Ali.

02:09:35.590 --> 02:09:37.926
- Mrs. Ali.
- Hello, Muhammad, Mr. Cosell.

02:09:37.968 --> 02:09:40.805
- Hey, when you get in?
- Today.

02:09:40.888 --> 02:09:44.309
And I learned we now have this suite
at the intercontinental Hotel.

02:09:45.811 --> 02:09:48.189
Muhammad, may I have
a word with you, please?

02:09:48.272 --> 02:09:49.690
Yeah.

02:09:58.618 --> 02:09:59.870
What's goin' on?

02:09:59.953 --> 02:10:02.373
What do you mean,
what's goin' on?

02:10:02.456 --> 02:10:04.917
Do you have to throw it
in my face?

02:10:05.001 --> 02:10:08.589
Do I have to read about it? Do people
have to call me on the phone to tell me?

02:10:08.672 --> 02:10:10.591
I didn't mean for that
to come out.

02:10:10.675 --> 02:10:14.429
And I live with the casual ones.
I live with 'em.

02:10:14.513 --> 02:10:17.349
So why do you
disrespect me like this?

02:10:17.433 --> 02:10:21.062
I respect you.
I will always respect you.

02:10:30.866 --> 02:10:32.493
Do you love her?

02:10:38.042 --> 02:10:39.502
I don't know.

02:10:46.260 --> 02:10:48.846
So what is supposed to happen now?

02:10:50.682 --> 02:10:52.601
I fight George.

02:10:54.186 --> 02:10:56.856
I didn't come all this far to lose.

02:10:59.526 --> 02:11:00.945
Neither did l.

02:11:27.227 --> 02:11:28.645
Belinda.

02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:34.528
What, Bingham?

02:15:09.876 --> 02:15:11.127
There it is.

02:15:25.103 --> 02:15:27.481
Hey, Zack, where's George?

02:15:27.564 --> 02:15:29.024
What's he pulling?

02:15:29.066 --> 02:15:30.943
Where's George?
Where'd he go?

02:15:32.028 --> 02:15:35.282
I just wanna make sure
you're gonna control the evening.

02:15:36.033 --> 02:15:38.953
George is jerking us off,
making us wait.

02:17:17.366 --> 02:17:21.079
It's all over for you, man.
You don't have a chance.

02:17:22.205 --> 02:17:24.207
You don't have no chance.

02:17:24.290 --> 02:17:26.334
The rumble in the jungle!

02:17:26.418 --> 02:17:28.504
You don't have no chance, man.

02:17:28.588 --> 02:17:29.672
Okay, let's go.

02:17:30.423 --> 02:17:33.093
You guys know the rules.
I want a good, clean fight.

02:17:33.177 --> 02:17:35.722
Ali, be quiet
and listen to the instructions.

02:17:35.805 --> 02:17:37.807
You been hearing about me
ever since you was a boy.

02:17:37.891 --> 02:17:40.311
Ali, be quiet.
Listen to the instructions.

02:17:40.394 --> 02:17:42.647
- Now you got to face me.

02:17:42.730 --> 02:17:45.150
- When I tell you to break...
- You got to face me now.

02:17:45.233 --> 02:17:47.193
Be quiet,
or I'll disqualify you.

02:17:47.277 --> 02:17:50.239
When I tell you to break,
I want a clean break. Understand?

02:17:50.281 --> 02:17:53.869
- You shoulda never came to Africa.
- All right, shake hands.

02:17:53.951 --> 02:17:55.913
Take your corners.

02:17:55.955 --> 02:17:58.040
Okay. All right.
No problem.

02:18:41.843 --> 02:18:43.305

02:18:52.983 --> 02:18:55.111
All right, break. Step back.

Take it to him!
That's what we came to do, Daddy!

02:19:41.501 --> 02:19:43.462

- That's all you got?
- Ive via satellite...

02:19:46.215 --> 02:19:48.175
direct from Zaire, Africa.

02:19:50.679 --> 02:19:53.599
- There we go.
- That's it, Daddy.

02:19:53.683 --> 02:19:56.394
You just keep dancing
around him, okay?

02:19:57.229 --> 02:19:58.856
Just keep moving.

02:20:06.574 --> 02:20:08.409
Legs hurting.

02:20:09.494 --> 02:20:10.954
Air heavy...

02:20:11.037 --> 02:20:13.040
ike I'm in water.

02:20:33.982 --> 02:20:35.985
Get away from the rope!

02:20:37.570 --> 02:20:40.574
Get off the rope!
Get off there! Move it!

02:20:42.952 --> 02:20:45.663
Get off there! Get off there!

02:20:54.174 --> 02:20:56.093

02:21:08.859 --> 02:21:10.694
Come on, Ali!

02:21:12.530 --> 02:21:15.492
That's it?
That's all you got? That's it?

02:21:21.207 --> 02:21:23.627
Move him out to the center!

02:21:23.668 --> 02:21:25.295
There he goes!

02:21:27.298 --> 02:21:30.635
Get away from the ropes!
Get off the ropes!

02:22:04.302 --> 02:22:06.888
Been here before.

02:22:06.972 --> 02:22:08.974
Little greenroom.

02:22:09.057 --> 02:22:11.602
Open that door.
Gonna get out this place.

02:22:11.686 --> 02:22:14.272
Come on, man,
get up and get out.

02:22:29.541 --> 02:22:32.378
They said you could punch, George.

02:22:32.420 --> 02:22:35.131
You ain't hittin'.
You hittin' like a sissy, George.

02:22:36.758 --> 02:22:39.011
You can't lay up on the ropes
like that.

02:22:40.054 --> 02:22:44.434
You're letting him beat on you.
You can't do that, champ. Come on, now.

02:22:44.476 --> 02:22:48.231
- You wanna explain that to me?
- Jab, then go to the middle of the ring.

02:22:48.272 --> 02:22:51.652
- You had your fight going, then...
- You gotta dance, baby.

02:22:51.735 --> 02:22:55.114
Shut up! Just be quiet!
You let me take care of this!

02:22:55.156 --> 02:22:58.410
Got to dance.
You can't come out there like that.

02:22:58.452 --> 02:23:00.412
- You can't back up.
- You got to respect the man.

02:23:00.454 --> 02:23:04.375
What is with the ropes? Something
going on you wanna talk to me about?

02:23:04.459 --> 02:23:07.421
Tell me what's going on with you.
What are you doing?

02:23:07.504 --> 02:23:11.301
Put the jab on him.
You got to let him go and dance.

02:23:11.342 --> 02:23:14.888
Don't let him get in your corner.
He's tying to cut the ring off you.

02:23:14.972 --> 02:23:18.810
He's tying to cut you off the ring.
You can't let that happen.

02:23:19.978 --> 02:23:22.231
Just take care of it!

02:23:24.942 --> 02:23:28.155
And there's the bell.
The fighters meet in mid-ring.

02:23:38.167 --> 02:23:39.669
Get off the ropes!

02:23:39.711 --> 02:23:41.588
Stay off the ropes!

02:23:43.298 --> 02:23:46.636
Foreman again
pushing him against the ropes.

02:23:46.677 --> 02:23:51.141
And Ali laying back, fighting those
blows against the sides of his body.

02:23:51.183 --> 02:23:53.811
Get back in the middle
of the ring, Ali!

02:23:54.854 --> 02:23:57.149
Muhammad, get off the ropes!

02:24:29.230 --> 02:24:32.859
You're punching like a sissy, George.
Punching like a sissy.

02:24:45.041 --> 02:24:47.210
What the hell's going on?
Come on.

02:24:59.267 --> 02:25:02.896
George, get him back.
What the hell's going on? Come on.

02:25:14.994 --> 02:25:17.748
You got to get off the ropes!

02:25:17.789 --> 02:25:19.375
Get off the ropes!

02:25:19.458 --> 02:25:22.378
Eight rounds to go.
Running out of gas, big fella?

02:25:23.547 --> 02:25:24.965
Let him go.

02:25:37.939 --> 02:25:41.861
Can't let you get that second wind which
you don't even know is there for you.

02:25:41.944 --> 02:25:45.115
You want the title?
Want to wear the heavyweight crown?

02:25:45.156 --> 02:25:48.327
Nose broke, jaw smashed,
face busted in.

02:25:48.410 --> 02:25:50.329
You ready for that?
Is that you?

02:25:50.413 --> 02:25:53.834
'Cause you facing a man who will die
before he lets you win.

02:26:06.182 --> 02:26:09.103
Ali, don't let him beat on you
on the inside.

02:26:10.229 --> 02:26:12.190
Don't let him beat on you
on the inside.

02:26:20.867 --> 02:26:22.202
Come on, Ali.

02:26:24.204 --> 02:26:26.415
Let's go, Ali.

02:26:26.499 --> 02:26:29.711
Let's go, baby!
Stay off the ropes!

02:26:29.753 --> 02:26:31.088
Get off the ropes!

02:26:31.171 --> 02:26:33.466
There it is.
Keep 'em in his face.

02:26:35.093 --> 02:26:36.094
Break!

02:26:36.177 --> 02:26:38.305
Oh, you missed him, George!

02:26:38.389 --> 02:26:40.516
You gotta go to work on him, Ali!

02:26:49.068 --> 02:26:52.030
I thought you could punch, George.
They said you could punch.

02:26:52.072 --> 02:26:53.532
Come on, Ali!

02:26:54.742 --> 02:26:57.495
Get away from the rope!
Get off the rope!

02:26:57.579 --> 02:26:58.997
He got him!

02:27:05.505 --> 02:27:07.424
Move him around! Take him!

02:27:08.634 --> 02:27:10.094
Come on, Ali!

02:27:17.144 --> 02:27:20.357
Get off the ropes!
Get off the ropes!

02:27:21.525 --> 02:27:22.902
Get off the ropes!

02:28:07.999 --> 02:28:10.961
George Foreman is hit
by a combination of punches...

02:28:11.002 --> 02:28:12.504
and down he goes!

02:28:12.546 --> 02:28:14.298
George Foreman is down!

02:28:14.340 --> 02:28:17.427
He's fallen
like a tree in the forest!

02:28:17.510 --> 02:28:20.848
He is felled by a combination of blows
from Muhammad Ali!

02:28:38.995 --> 02:28:42.207
Okay, this fight's over!
This fight's over!

02:28:54.598 --> 02:28:57.184
I told you! I told you!

02:29:07.113 --> 02:29:10.659
Referee Zack Clayton is counting.
Seven, eight!

02:29:10.742 --> 02:29:12.703
And he's on his knee.
It is over!

02:29:12.787 --> 02:29:14.831
It is over! It is over!

02:29:14.914 --> 02:29:16.374
It is over!

02:29:16.416 --> 02:29:20.463
George Foreman has been knocked out
by Muhammad Ali!

02:29:20.546 --> 02:29:23.049
Muhammad Ali
has done the impossible!

02:29:23.091 --> 02:29:25.511
He has regained
the heavyweight crown...

02:29:25.594 --> 02:29:30.058
that was taken unjustly
from him in 1 967.

02:29:32.936 --> 02:29:35.565
What a moment of history
in this arena...

02:29:35.648 --> 02:29:38.109
in Zaire, Africa!

02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:50.583
A tremendous, tremendous moment.
