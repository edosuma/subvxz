00:51.424 --> 00:52.558
<i>I'm the hero.</i>

00:54.126 --> 00:55.461
<i>Big shiny hero.</i>

00:57.863 --> 00:59.931
<i>A bloodbath won't do anything.</i>

01:02.502 --> 01:03.536
<i>What, are you trying
to be a hero now?</i>

01:05.102 --> 01:07.507
<i>Grace Baker keeps her word.</i>

01:08.474 --> 01:10.208
<i>Stay in your lane, Sheriff.</i>

01:11.244 --> 01:12.978
<i>You're a fucking
waste of space.</i>

01:15.281 --> 01:17.849
<i>Who the fuck killed my sister?</i>

01:43.909 --> 01:45.578
All right, sir,
I need you to stand up please.

01:52.552 --> 01:55.120
<i>You have to
fight for your liberty.</i>

01:55.355 --> 01:57.022
<i>You have to support people</i>

01:57.055 --> 01:59.525
<i>who are willing to fight
for your liberty.</i>

02:01.594 --> 02:04.630
- See you soon, baby!
- Come on!

02:06.232 --> 02:08.368
Wish I were you!

02:12.672 --> 02:14.906
Don't get used to
the fresh air, asshole.

02:14.940 --> 02:15.941
You'll be back.

03:45.398 --> 03:46.699
I hope you don't want a hug.

03:47.733 --> 03:48.601
What are you wearing?

03:48.634 --> 03:50.969
You couldn't pick me up
a little closer?

03:51.270 --> 03:52.572
You look like GI Joe.

03:52.605 --> 03:54.540
The fuck?
You're one to talk, emo kid.

03:54.874 --> 03:58.711
Dude, my plan was
to go to Keats's house,

03:58.744 --> 04:01.747
not the forest.
Like, what are you wearing?

04:01.781 --> 04:03.516
- You look like an idiot.
- Your plan?

04:03.549 --> 04:05.451
It's not your plan.
First of all,

04:05.485 --> 04:07.587
I planned this
for the past 10 years.

04:07.620 --> 04:09.522
I don't even know what
Brigit saw in you.

04:09.555 --> 04:10.690
Get in the car.

04:11.257 --> 04:12.758
Yeah, it's not your plan.

04:18.363 --> 04:20.333
- What's this?
- My ashtray.

04:20.366 --> 04:21.801
What are you smoking
three packs a day?

04:21.834 --> 04:23.736
That ain't gonna be
what kills me.

04:39.084 --> 04:40.319
Get out, I'm driving.

04:40.520 --> 04:41.721
My truck, my rules.

04:41.921 --> 04:43.823
Last time you tried
to drive me anywhere,

04:43.856 --> 04:45.825
you try to take me
to a mental institution,

04:45.858 --> 04:47.493
so I don't trust you.

04:47.527 --> 04:49.328
- Good morning, Toby.
- Fuck you.

04:50.161 --> 04:50.997
Prick.

04:51.029 --> 04:53.198
I still think this is a bad idea

04:53.232 --> 04:54.600
that we waited for him
all this time.

04:55.100 --> 04:57.270
Everything shit
that happened to Brigit

04:57.303 --> 04:59.070
happened after she got with him.

04:59.505 --> 05:03.074
Now, I ain't getting in
this truck unless I'm driving.

05:03.108 --> 05:05.745
Fine! Christ Almighty
on a broken rocking horse.

05:05.778 --> 05:07.446
It is too early for your crazy.

05:08.213 --> 05:10.650
Get out. Get out!

05:12.785 --> 05:14.453
Thank you, little sister.

05:15.821 --> 05:17.122
Oh, my God.

05:18.324 --> 05:20.125
I was listening to a preacher
this morning on the radio

05:20.158 --> 05:23.729
and he said the word "sinner"
six times in six minutes.

05:23.763 --> 05:25.331
You know what that means?

05:26.766 --> 05:28.768
I mean it's gonna be
a glorious day.

05:32.872 --> 05:33.773
Give me the gun.

05:36.475 --> 05:37.476
Don't hurt yourself.

06:00.833 --> 06:01.701
Right.

06:23.623 --> 06:24.657
Shit.

06:27.259 --> 06:28.761
Someone's here! Someone's here!

06:28.794 --> 06:29.795
The fuck?

06:42.908 --> 06:44.175
Come on, Toby.

06:48.814 --> 06:50.516
Does it look like
she needs help?

07:09.869 --> 07:10.936
Fuck, door's sealed.

07:17.843 --> 07:19.311
Hey, asshole.

07:20.112 --> 07:21.414
I can give you
anything you want.

07:21.747 --> 07:23.015
Oh, I think I know what you got.

07:23.049 --> 07:25.818
The only thing you're guilty of
right now is just trespassing.

07:25.851 --> 07:27.653
Nah, I killed that guard
back there.

07:30.356 --> 07:32.558
Keats has a guard?
Why does Keats have guard?

07:32.591 --> 07:34.694
And his boys are packing
some real firepower.

07:34.727 --> 07:36.962
That's military spec,
right there.

07:36.996 --> 07:38.864
Grace never mentioned anything
about a fucking guard.

07:39.065 --> 07:40.766
I knew he was hidin' something.

07:45.337 --> 07:46.872
You leave right now,
I swear I won't tell a soul.

07:46.906 --> 07:47.907
I won't say a word.

07:49.041 --> 07:50.876
You can answer a question for us
and we'll be on our way.

07:50.910 --> 07:52.278
Yes, anything.

07:53.646 --> 07:54.947
What happened to Brigit Baker?

07:55.748 --> 07:58.517
You were the last person
to see her alive.

07:59.051 --> 08:00.218
House is clear.

08:01.654 --> 08:04.523
See, I told you
this Ayn Rand-lovin',

08:04.557 --> 08:06.292
Epstein-wannabe
is hiding something.

08:06.325 --> 08:07.660
It's just my safe room..

08:07.893 --> 08:08.894
Fucking open it.

08:10.029 --> 08:11.864
Fuck the door! I want to know
what you did to Brigit.

08:12.431 --> 08:14.700
You can still go.
I didn't press the silent alarm.

08:14.734 --> 08:15.801
Go ahead, push it.

08:17.636 --> 08:19.905
You want me to trip the alarm?

08:19.939 --> 08:22.475
Yes we do, Doctor Keats.

08:22.508 --> 08:25.344
I'm not leaving here,
but you can.

08:26.011 --> 08:26.812
Push the button.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.381
Don't make him repeat himself.

08:29.849 --> 08:31.684
Let's get the whole town
in on the fun.

08:33.085 --> 08:34.385
Here's your baker's dozen.

08:34.419 --> 08:35.621
How we doing, sweetheart?

08:35.654 --> 08:37.823
- Cash or credit?
- Hold on.

08:42.595 --> 08:43.696
What are we working with?

08:44.864 --> 08:45.831
This'll do.

08:47.700 --> 08:49.769
Thanks.

08:50.369 --> 08:51.403
Hold on.

08:55.708 --> 08:57.009
Okay, bye.

08:59.078 --> 09:01.447
You forgot your gun.

09:03.349 --> 09:04.383
Oh, hell.

09:11.957 --> 09:13.526
All right, see you later.

09:32.711 --> 09:33.913
Hey.

09:35.848 --> 09:37.049
I thought you were dead.

09:37.850 --> 09:38.818
Get up.

09:39.552 --> 09:41.587
- It's time to get up.
- You could...

09:41.954 --> 09:44.456
- You could sit in my lap.
- Oh.

09:46.058 --> 09:49.895
I don't know if it could,
you know, hold both of us.

09:51.797 --> 09:52.798
Come on.

10:04.109 --> 10:05.312
Let's go.

10:05.744 --> 10:07.546
- Gotta go.
- Let's have a snow day.

10:07.580 --> 10:09.648
Nobody cares, Boy Scout.

10:11.050 --> 10:13.018
Here, oh, yes.

10:14.987 --> 10:16.822
Let's roll, old man.
I got donuts.

10:16.856 --> 10:18.023
The other one.

10:20.693 --> 10:22.494
Woo!

10:26.432 --> 10:27.499
Mm.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.501
You boys have fun out there.

10:30.035 --> 10:31.036
Christ, Chief.

10:31.737 --> 10:33.572
At least act like
you give a shit.

10:33.973 --> 10:34.974
Let's go.

10:48.821 --> 10:49.955
What's cooking?

10:50.656 --> 10:52.892
I just gotta go
to the kindergarten at 11,

10:52.925 --> 10:55.494
talk to the kids about
being a hero and all that.

10:57.630 --> 10:58.964
Nah, I wish.

11:00.199 --> 11:01.834
Let's go see your daddy.

11:02.501 --> 11:03.802
I need a word.

11:05.037 --> 11:06.872
Let's make it a surprise.

11:07.806 --> 11:09.408
My daddy don't like surprises.

11:11.143 --> 11:13.212
I understand.

11:13.246 --> 11:14.446
<i>Pull.</i>

11:39.104 --> 11:40.172
<i>Pull.</i>

11:53.185 --> 11:54.019
Pull.

12:25.251 --> 12:26.051
Pull.

12:40.233 --> 12:42.001
The '66 was better.

12:45.704 --> 12:46.972
Morning, Daddy.

12:54.213 --> 12:55.581
What's wrong?

12:56.915 --> 12:58.584
Maybe we just
want to come say hello.

13:00.019 --> 13:01.020
<i>Deputy Rutledge,</i>

13:01.053 --> 13:03.188
<i>Deputy Rutledge,
you got eyes on Sheriff Ben?</i>

13:04.357 --> 13:05.291
Yeah, I'm here.

13:05.325 --> 13:06.725
<i>Silent alarm
was just tripped</i>

13:06.759 --> 13:07.793
<i>at Doctor Keats's house.</i>

13:08.127 --> 13:09.628
<i>Probably him just
knocking it again,</i>

13:09.661 --> 13:11.730
<i>but when I called the house,
he didn't answer.</i>

13:11.764 --> 13:14.166
- <i>Copy?</i>
- One of his maids again.

13:15.301 --> 13:18.271
Get Marisa to, you know,
to head over.

13:18.737 --> 13:20.839
She ain't gonna be happy,
it's her day off.

13:22.007 --> 13:23.742
Yeah, Aggie, we got it.

13:23.776 --> 13:25.144
We're gonna handle it.
Thank you.

13:28.914 --> 13:30.015
Deputy Marisa.

13:33.286 --> 13:34.620
<i>Deputy Marisa?</i>

13:36.021 --> 13:37.022
What?

13:37.524 --> 13:39.925
I'm requesting a 89
at the residence

13:39.958 --> 13:41.693
of one Doctor John Keats.

13:42.628 --> 13:43.562
1403...

13:43.595 --> 13:44.997
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

13:45.030 --> 13:46.165
<i>It's my day off.</i>

13:47.333 --> 13:49.802
Deputy,
crime don't take days off.

13:50.270 --> 13:52.204
<i>One of his maids must
have hit it with her ass.</i>

13:53.138 --> 13:54.139
'Preciate it, Deputy.

13:57.843 --> 13:59.178
Oop!

14:03.816 --> 14:05.050
Problem handled.

14:06.685 --> 14:11.723
Delegated. That's the word
you're looking for, delegated.

14:13.259 --> 14:14.260
What you want, Ben?

14:15.727 --> 14:17.062
I've been doing some math.

14:17.430 --> 14:19.031
There you go, son.

14:22.302 --> 14:24.870
I saw this real nice boat.

14:25.438 --> 14:27.840
A schooner in, uh, Jacksonville.

14:30.443 --> 14:32.010
Hand me a water, would you?

14:34.179 --> 14:35.281
Pull.

14:41.321 --> 14:42.355
- Thank you.
- There you go.

14:44.756 --> 14:45.757
Pull.

14:52.064 --> 14:53.732
Why don't you try
hitting one, son?

14:54.700 --> 14:56.336
Those shells are expensive.

14:57.202 --> 14:58.304
Sorry, Pa.

14:59.004 --> 15:02.040
He always said
he takes after his mother.

15:02.542 --> 15:05.378
She'd be rolling in her grave
she saw him shoot like that.

15:09.148 --> 15:10.182
How much?

15:11.783 --> 15:12.784
50.

15:16.188 --> 15:17.222
30'll cover it.

15:19.191 --> 15:20.393
Thank you.

15:22.262 --> 15:24.763
Drop by the house tonight,
I'll have it for you.

15:25.498 --> 15:27.400
Pull.

15:32.372 --> 15:33.373
Get in there.

15:33.739 --> 15:36.074
- Get...
- Easy. Easy!

15:36.376 --> 15:37.310
- Sit down.
- Easy.

15:40.045 --> 15:42.415
- You okay, little sis?
- Always.

15:44.417 --> 15:46.486
What you hiding
behind that door, huh?

15:46.519 --> 15:48.153
You the Black El Chapo

15:48.187 --> 15:49.255
or you running
a sex cult

15:49.289 --> 15:51.424
sending in the blood of virgins
to the ultra rich?

15:51.457 --> 15:52.958
You watch
too much YouTube, Toby.

15:52.991 --> 15:54.860
Doctor Keats ain't
sellin' virgin blood.

15:54.893 --> 15:57.397
society's
a real thing, Grace.

15:58.498 --> 16:00.165
What's taking the sheriff
so long?

16:00.567 --> 16:01.900
T, give me his phone.

16:03.336 --> 16:04.404
They don't let me have a phone

16:04.437 --> 16:06.239
who don't let you have a phone?

16:07.440 --> 16:08.740
I've already said too much.

16:09.342 --> 16:10.909
T, give me your phone.

16:12.077 --> 16:13.145
Do you think I'm dumb?

16:13.446 --> 16:15.214
I didn't bring my phone,
they could track me.

16:15.248 --> 16:17.115
- Grace.
- All right.

16:33.932 --> 16:36.469
You ain't never tied
anybody to a chair before?

16:36.502 --> 16:38.971
- That's not how you do it.
- What, you want Roy to do it?

16:53.620 --> 16:55.555
Albany Federal Bureau
of Investigations.

16:55.588 --> 16:56.356
How can I help?

17:10.236 --> 17:11.471
Say that again.

17:11.503 --> 17:13.872
I have one Roy Lambert
on the other line,

17:14.205 --> 17:16.509
he says
he's taken John Keats hostage.

17:17.443 --> 17:19.345
What a horrendous prank.

17:20.045 --> 17:21.580
<i>It doesn't sound like
a prank, sir.</i>

17:22.648 --> 17:26.852
Hey, Daddy. Yeah,
my friends are on their way.

17:27.051 --> 17:28.488
<i>You're gonna see 'em
real soon.</i>

17:28.920 --> 17:31.156
They'll be there in
just a minute, don't you worry.

17:31.823 --> 17:33.359
Brass will take care of it.

17:33.892 --> 17:35.961
<i>Sir, we have to roll the unit.</i>

17:35.994 --> 17:38.830
Hostage situations are federal,
it's protocol.

17:38.864 --> 17:40.566
<i>Perhaps
you never got the call.</i>

17:40.600 --> 17:42.134
It's already been logged.

17:44.337 --> 17:45.505
Where they coming from?

17:45.837 --> 17:48.374
Albany.
That's an hour to Fitzgerald.

17:48.675 --> 17:51.411
If they get there and sense
there's anything in that house,

17:51.444 --> 17:53.279
<i>they will come in
and they will find it.</i>

17:54.179 --> 17:55.515
An hour.

17:56.948 --> 17:58.518
Stall 'em as long as you can.

17:59.585 --> 18:00.453
Mm-hm.

18:02.522 --> 18:03.523
Who was that?

18:04.590 --> 18:07.293
Someone we pay
to keep us informed.

18:08.528 --> 18:10.463
Roy Lambert's out of prison?

18:12.465 --> 18:14.166
Go start the truck, son.

18:24.544 --> 18:26.044
Shoulda killed him.

18:27.079 --> 18:28.314
Can you clean this up?

18:30.082 --> 18:31.183
How clean?

18:32.285 --> 18:33.619
Don't have to be squeaky.

18:35.288 --> 18:37.989
- Doctor Keats?
- Alive.

18:38.924 --> 18:42.094
Can't lose Doctor Keats,
you know that, right?

18:42.595 --> 18:44.196
He's the best at what he does.

18:46.399 --> 18:48.200
I should send in Silas.

18:48.234 --> 18:50.269
No, no, you don't wanna do that.

18:51.671 --> 18:52.971
Let me try.

18:53.506 --> 18:55.408
Well, Silas can get this done.

18:55.708 --> 18:57.075
You want discreet?

18:57.577 --> 18:59.312
That's why I'm here.

19:02.948 --> 19:03.949
All right.

19:05.050 --> 19:07.185
You get a shot at Roy,
you're gonna take it, right?

19:08.287 --> 19:09.221
Yes, sir.

19:09.255 --> 19:11.491
<i>FBI is 55 minutes out.</i>

19:11.524 --> 19:13.459
Call just went out on the radio.

19:16.027 --> 19:17.463
You contain this.

19:57.336 --> 19:58.404
Thank God.

20:13.553 --> 20:15.555
Let's try some diplomacy.

20:22.328 --> 20:24.263
- Grace, give me a rifle.
- Why?

20:24.297 --> 20:26.365
The sheriff is here.
Give me a rifle, come on.

20:26.899 --> 20:30.101
- A big one.
- You get what you get.

20:32.271 --> 20:34.973
- I'm gonna do the talking.
- That's all you do.

20:36.542 --> 20:37.443
Hey, Keats.

20:37.477 --> 20:40.480
Tell me, how does
a small-town pharmacist

20:40.513 --> 20:42.248
afford a place like this, huh?

20:42.748 --> 20:43.549
I'm frugal.

20:45.050 --> 20:46.017
Bullshit.

20:46.051 --> 20:48.019
My family's lived in this house
for 85 years

20:48.053 --> 20:49.689
until you uppity animals
barged in.

20:49.722 --> 20:50.523
Shut the hell up.

20:50.556 --> 20:52.558
Bet the farm
you don't see sundown.

21:08.674 --> 21:09.742
That's far enough, Ben.

21:12.745 --> 21:16.649
Can we pretend for a moment
that we're civilized?

21:19.719 --> 21:21.787
I need proof of life.

21:24.457 --> 21:25.591
Doctor.

21:26.224 --> 21:27.360
You well?

21:27.393 --> 21:28.794
That's a stupid question
considerin' the circumstance,

21:28.828 --> 21:30.061
you drunk bastard.

21:30.563 --> 21:31.631
Tell them I'll pay them
whatever they want.

21:31.664 --> 21:33.799
- Shut the fuck up.
- It's all about the money

21:33.833 --> 21:34.634
with you people.

21:37.770 --> 21:39.605
I thought you were
in the big house.

21:40.640 --> 21:42.073
Got out a few hours ago.

21:42.107 --> 21:43.376
You hurt anyone yet?

21:43.676 --> 21:45.611
Yep, and the day is still young.

21:46.612 --> 21:48.281
You want to negotiate, kid?

21:48.681 --> 21:51.149
Money? Reparations?

21:51.350 --> 21:53.619
How about a nice gin and tonic?

21:55.254 --> 21:56.656
Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

21:56.689 --> 21:58.424
Where's your
hometown spirit, Ben?

21:59.224 --> 22:03.629
I know you know exactly
who to ask to get what we want.

22:03.663 --> 22:06.265
- Which is?
- The answer to one question.

22:06.532 --> 22:08.501
Who the fuck killed my sister?

22:09.535 --> 22:10.636
I investigated.

22:11.737 --> 22:13.406
She went missing.

22:13.439 --> 22:15.140
She probably went to Atlanta.

22:15.608 --> 22:17.843
Yeah, got mixed up
in a bad scene.

22:17.877 --> 22:20.713
My sister wasn't no junkie.
She would never just run off.

22:21.247 --> 22:24.182
The last time she was seen,
she was coming here,

22:24.717 --> 22:26.285
to Doctor Keats's house.

22:26.852 --> 22:28.287
So here's what's what.

22:28.321 --> 22:30.323
You have 30 minutes to solve

22:30.356 --> 22:31.557
the disappearance
of Brigit Baker.

22:31.591 --> 22:32.825
Or?

22:32.858 --> 22:34.860
Or I start sending out
John Keats piece by piece

22:34.894 --> 22:36.429
until you got him all.

22:36.462 --> 22:37.663
So let me get this straight.

22:37.930 --> 22:40.800
If you don't hear
what you don't want to hear,

22:41.434 --> 22:43.703
then you're going to
shoot Doctor Keats.

22:44.337 --> 22:46.137
That's right.

22:47.840 --> 22:50.910
It took all three of you
to come up with that?

22:50.943 --> 22:52.578
Call the FBI,

22:52.612 --> 22:54.680
get every Leo in the state here,

22:54.880 --> 22:56.782
or I kill my number one suspect.

22:56.816 --> 22:58.651
- No, Roy.
- Yes, Ben.

22:58.951 --> 23:00.920
30 minutes, three-zero,

23:00.953 --> 23:03.389
or I start asking Doctor Keats
the truth.

23:03.856 --> 23:05.791
And if he doesn't answer?

23:05.825 --> 23:07.927
I put a gun to his head
and I ask him again.

23:07.960 --> 23:09.795
And if he still doesn't answer?

23:09.829 --> 23:11.263
It's a small town.

23:11.597 --> 23:14.800
She's got a lot of bullets.
Someone's gonna talk.

23:15.568 --> 23:18.738
This started 10 years ago,
but it ends today.

23:36.722 --> 23:38.591
What in God's name
possessed them to do this?

23:39.157 --> 23:40.760
They're here for Brigit.

23:41.594 --> 23:43.496
- Who?
- Brigit Baker.

23:47.466 --> 23:49.835
We should smoke 'em out
right now before they dig in.

23:50.903 --> 23:52.203
Fuck.

23:53.639 --> 23:54.640
Yeah.

24:00.980 --> 24:02.515
<i>Deputy Lewis.</i>

24:04.383 --> 24:05.918
<i>Deputy Lewis, are you on?</i>

24:07.753 --> 24:09.789
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, what's up?

24:10.389 --> 24:13.693
Thanks for doing that welfare
check on Doctor Keats.

24:13.893 --> 24:15.895
No problem, no problem.

24:16.162 --> 24:19.732
Did you notice anything,
uh, unusual?

24:19.965 --> 24:22.435
Mm-mm, no. No, nothing.

24:22.835 --> 24:25.337
Nothing?
'Cause he's been taken hostage

24:25.838 --> 24:27.306
- <i>by Roy Lambert...</i>
- Fuck.

24:27.640 --> 24:29.875
- ...<i>Grace Baker, and Toby.</i>
- What?

24:30.643 --> 24:33.345
- What's Toby's last name?
- Tony Cavendish.

24:33.779 --> 24:36.415
- Toby Cavendish.
- Same mom as Grace and Brigit.

24:36.449 --> 24:37.717
- Different dad.
- <i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

24:37.750 --> 24:38.951
<i>I'm on my way, I'm on my way.</i>

24:39.285 --> 24:41.954
I want you to go
to the far side of the lake,

24:42.254 --> 24:43.856
- <i>go to the point.</i>
- You got it.

24:43.889 --> 24:45.991
- <i>Play God.</i>
- You got it, you got it. Shit.

24:48.461 --> 24:49.862
This whole police department
is fucked.

24:50.262 --> 24:52.832
First thing I'm gonna do when
I get in charge, I'm firing her.

24:53.499 --> 24:55.501
FBI's gonna make a meal
out of this.

24:56.202 --> 24:57.837
We should wait,
let them handle it.

24:58.237 --> 25:00.372
Yeah, the feds are gonna
fuck this up.

25:02.608 --> 25:04.643
Let's let them cool off.

25:05.478 --> 25:06.846
What, are you trying to
be a hero now?

25:07.480 --> 25:11.016
Fuck off.
I can do this.

25:12.952 --> 25:14.820
What you hidin'
in that safe room, Keats?

25:15.421 --> 25:19.291
That where you keep your
reptilian friends hidden? Hm?

25:20.860 --> 25:23.963
I'm gonna find out all your
secrets by the end of this day.

25:24.764 --> 25:25.531
What gives you the impression

25:25.564 --> 25:27.933
that I'm anything
but a good man?

25:28.167 --> 25:30.669
Well, this is Georgia.

25:30.903 --> 25:32.371
Everyone is doing something

25:32.404 --> 25:33.973
they're not
supposed to be doing.

25:34.173 --> 25:36.308
Sometimes it's their cousin

25:36.876 --> 25:39.845
and sometimes people
are running a satanic sex cult.

25:40.880 --> 25:41.881
Now.

25:42.114 --> 25:44.383
I say we just remove
his fingernails

25:44.416 --> 25:45.584
with a fucking blender.

25:45.618 --> 25:46.886
How would that even work?

25:47.453 --> 25:50.923
I read a book about it.
You break the wrist first.

25:50.956 --> 25:52.958
You tap the fingers,
you do one finger at a time...

25:52.992 --> 25:54.894
We're not fucking
torturing anyone!

25:55.795 --> 25:56.896
- Yet.
- No.

25:58.130 --> 26:00.032
You don't got the stomach
for this,

26:00.065 --> 26:02.034
why don't you just
walk off, Roy?

26:02.334 --> 26:05.371
- Right now.
- Brigit was everything to me.

26:05.604 --> 26:08.407
I think about her
every fucking day.

26:08.440 --> 26:11.777
She made me a better person
and if we torture him,

26:11.811 --> 26:13.479
we're no fucking better
than him.

26:14.780 --> 26:18.017
We were country
founded on violence, Roy.

26:18.050 --> 26:19.051
You hear me?

26:19.585 --> 26:20.920
Fuck are you talking about?

26:20.953 --> 26:23.055
I'm talking about
our constitutional right

26:23.088 --> 26:27.393
as American citizens
to enact violence on people

26:27.593 --> 26:30.796
so we can get what we want
in the name of justice.

26:30.830 --> 26:32.832
You are fucking crazy!

26:33.632 --> 26:34.800
Yes, I am.

26:37.570 --> 26:41.073
You are a rare specimen, Toby.
And you too, Grace.

26:41.407 --> 26:42.608
Thank you.

26:42.908 --> 26:45.578
I didn't mean that
as a good thing.

26:46.045 --> 26:48.581
You see,
Brigit was nothing like you.

26:49.014 --> 26:50.716
She was a team player.

26:50.749 --> 26:52.918
Hey, she worked for you
one summer for two months.

26:53.253 --> 26:54.453
You didn't know her.

26:55.654 --> 26:57.089
Brigit Baker was not the young
woman you thought she was.

26:57.122 --> 26:58.490
What do you mean?

27:00.125 --> 27:01.794
She never loved you, Roy.

27:01.827 --> 27:02.928
Ain't that the truth.

27:02.962 --> 27:05.998
No, you do not have permission
to talk to me like that.

27:06.031 --> 27:08.701
I will talk to you
however I want to.

27:08.734 --> 27:09.635
No, you won't.

27:09.668 --> 27:12.004
We were in love.
From the moment I met her,

27:12.037 --> 27:13.973
she was everything to me.

27:14.974 --> 27:16.442
Where'd you meet, Roy?

27:16.475 --> 27:18.077
It's none of
your fucking business.

27:18.777 --> 27:22.948
You met at a show in Bridgeport
and one cool summer night.

27:30.990 --> 27:32.524
'Bout 11:05.

27:35.961 --> 27:37.463
<i>She swept you off your feet.</i>

27:42.568 --> 27:45.070
<i>You was her music man.</i>

27:47.840 --> 27:48.874
How do you know that?

27:48.908 --> 27:50.976
She tell you that
before you fucking killed her?

27:51.911 --> 27:56.115
Brigit only spoke to you,
tolerated you,

27:56.715 --> 27:58.751
because Charles Rutledge
ordered it.

27:59.518 --> 28:03.455
That's a lie.
That's a fucking lie!

28:07.059 --> 28:08.560
And you two?

28:09.296 --> 28:11.196
She was embarrassed
by the both of you.

28:12.197 --> 28:13.666
Truth is,

28:13.999 --> 28:16.635
she resented the fact that
she was even related to you.

28:16.669 --> 28:18.871
Truth is,
she could be a prissy bitch.

28:18.904 --> 28:20.739
Hey, you don't
talk about her like that.

28:20.773 --> 28:24.176
- ...my sister too, I'mma talk...
- Do not disrespect her name

28:24.209 --> 28:26.812
right now!

28:26.845 --> 28:30.115
Stop! He's just trying
to get in our fucking heads!

28:30.149 --> 28:31.150
Stop!

28:32.151 --> 28:33.052
Stop!

28:35.521 --> 28:38.023
Well, it's fucking working.
Ain't it?

29:45.758 --> 29:46.959
Mr. Rutledge.

29:50.162 --> 29:51.264
Grace Baker?

29:53.732 --> 29:54.733
Okay.

29:55.768 --> 29:56.769
Move out.

30:25.331 --> 30:28.000
I'm going to find out
all your secrets, I am.

30:31.036 --> 30:32.137
Okay.

30:32.505 --> 30:34.173
How does this work?

30:38.344 --> 30:42.014
Oh, and you thought you built
you so smart, you damn door.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.183
Let me tell you,

30:45.150 --> 30:49.255
Toby's going to find a way in.
Fucking find a way.

30:51.990 --> 30:55.160
Oh, guess we're gonna do this
the old fashioned way, door.

31:11.777 --> 31:13.178
Here we go.

31:18.418 --> 31:19.218
Fire in the hole.

31:24.324 --> 31:26.024
What the fuck was that?

31:27.025 --> 31:28.894
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

31:28.927 --> 31:31.930
- What the fuck was that?
- Sounded like C4.

31:36.369 --> 31:37.870
Shit.

31:39.204 --> 31:42.074
You are one goddamn
strong door, aren't you?

31:43.008 --> 31:44.244
Where'd he get C4 from?

31:44.444 --> 31:46.845
I don't know.
Probably had it in his pocket.

31:47.347 --> 31:48.714
Redneck.

31:51.417 --> 31:54.354
That was some of the weakest C4
I ever blown up.

31:56.088 --> 31:57.222
That's all right.

31:59.292 --> 32:01.093
I'm gonna find my way in.

32:03.263 --> 32:04.264
Here we go.

32:06.798 --> 32:08.434
Ah, shit!

32:10.236 --> 32:11.770
We should get in there,
save the day.

32:14.340 --> 32:16.108
Well, that would be stupid.

32:20.346 --> 32:22.382
Ha-ha! Hell yes.

32:22.415 --> 32:25.251
That's a '61 St. Andrews,
don't you dare.

32:27.453 --> 32:29.955
It's a little early
to be celebrating, Grace.

32:33.091 --> 32:34.427
Bit late to be sober.

32:35.295 --> 32:38.030
Nah, you're on probation,
that would be illegal.

32:38.063 --> 32:39.731
Are you ever not a fuck up?

32:40.466 --> 32:43.336
Give me one more ounce of lip
and I will lay you out.

32:45.037 --> 32:46.406
You are a very angry person.

32:46.439 --> 32:48.374
Oh-ho,
I can be a violent person too.

32:48.408 --> 32:50.376
I contain multitudes,
motherfucker.

32:52.778 --> 32:54.314
You people are sick in the head.

32:56.114 --> 32:57.483
We haven't even
gotten started yet.

32:58.451 --> 33:00.453
You killed Kane in cold blood.

33:00.486 --> 33:03.456
Our blood hasn't been cold
in 10 years.

33:03.489 --> 33:05.791
- Who's Kane?
- Your security guard?

33:05.824 --> 33:09.262
Yeah, I tore through him
like a seafood buffet.

33:09.295 --> 33:10.463
He's not my guard.

33:11.497 --> 33:12.498
The fuck you say?

33:13.266 --> 33:15.033
You're so naïve, child.

33:15.867 --> 33:19.071
I'd leave this place if I could.
Forget it.

33:19.104 --> 33:20.440
Say that again.

33:22.107 --> 33:24.310
Charles. He's the monster.

33:24.843 --> 33:27.212
He's the one you need to be
asking questions about Brigit,

33:27.513 --> 33:28.448
not me.

33:28.481 --> 33:29.881
They don't let you leave?

33:32.851 --> 33:35.754
Once a week I get to go get
a good meal at a restaurant.

33:36.121 --> 33:37.889
Other than that,
I'll work for Charles.

33:39.191 --> 33:41.126
Over and over.

33:41.893 --> 33:44.963
- You're serious.
- As cancer.

34:00.045 --> 34:01.314
<i>What does Charles Rutledge</i>

34:01.347 --> 34:02.348
<i>have to do with this?</i>

34:03.915 --> 34:05.251
<i>All we want is the truth.</i>

34:05.285 --> 34:07.387
It's not as easy as it sounds.

34:08.288 --> 34:11.089
Nothing worth getting is easy,
except drunk.

34:11.556 --> 34:14.327
Easy? Not the way I do it.

34:14.360 --> 34:16.496
Oh, we're making jokes now?

34:16.529 --> 34:17.996
Well, here's a funny one
for you.

34:18.030 --> 34:19.599
Brigit was 19
when she disappeared

34:19.632 --> 34:22.335
and she never had
a legal drink in her life.

34:38.216 --> 34:41.018
If, you know you were them,

34:42.054 --> 34:43.456
how would you escape?

34:43.489 --> 34:45.956
Well, we got lake on both sides,

34:46.726 --> 34:49.594
but in the back, it's just bush
all the way to Florida.

34:52.130 --> 34:53.931
They knew they weren't leaving.

35:02.642 --> 35:04.243
<i>Mr. Rutledge.</i>

35:04.943 --> 35:07.079
I got this
right where I want it.

35:07.280 --> 35:09.915
- <i>Not fast enough.</i>
- I'm taking care of it.

35:10.616 --> 35:14.454
Silas and the old boys are en
route to expedite the situation.

35:14.654 --> 35:17.256
We can't just
shoot our way out of it.

35:21.927 --> 35:23.296
Doctor Keats...

35:23.895 --> 35:25.931
means a great deal to this town.

35:26.499 --> 35:29.134
We lose him, we possibly
lose our way of life.

35:30.403 --> 35:31.537
<i>Am I understood?</i>

35:32.839 --> 35:37.343
There's a chance that this ends
without another bullet fired.

35:38.644 --> 35:41.447
- <i>How?</i>
- Anything you can tell me?

35:42.582 --> 35:45.016
About Brigit's disappearance?

35:45.651 --> 35:48.554
- I wouldn't go there.
- <i>Or what?</i>

35:50.590 --> 35:52.425
You might join her.

35:53.459 --> 35:54.960
Wherever that may be.

35:55.294 --> 35:58.498
- A girl went missing.
- <i>You investigated.</i>

36:00.299 --> 36:04.102
And the town had a vigil,
and no body was ever found.

36:05.471 --> 36:07.440
You even said it yourself.

36:07.939 --> 36:11.977
- <i>No body, no crime.</i>
- Think of their perspective.

36:13.413 --> 36:14.980
<i>Imagine if it was Kyle.</i>

36:15.281 --> 36:16.649
<i>How far would you go for him?</i>

36:17.082 --> 36:18.984
Stay in your lane, Sheriff.

36:19.485 --> 36:20.586
<i>Assist Silas.</i>

36:21.186 --> 36:26.492
The FBI negotiating team is
going to be here in 41 minutes.

36:27.125 --> 36:29.995
<i>I need this wrapped
in a bow in 30.</i>

36:39.439 --> 36:41.340
Your daddy sends his love.

36:42.007 --> 36:44.677
I thought Roy Lambert
was doing 10 years for assault.

36:45.043 --> 36:48.079
- He was.
- Who did he attack?

36:50.015 --> 36:51.317
Three guesses.

36:52.452 --> 36:54.520
Doctor Keats? No.

36:55.388 --> 36:56.422
Dad?

36:57.222 --> 36:59.090
Roy sucker-punched him.

37:01.427 --> 37:03.596
Yeah,
and your dad got him a decade.

37:03.796 --> 37:05.698
10 years for assaulting someone?

37:05.964 --> 37:07.600
Must have been hell of a punch.

37:08.166 --> 37:09.134
It was.

37:11.203 --> 37:13.739
After we called off
the search for Brigit,

37:14.407 --> 37:17.510
your father,
in his infinite wisdom,

37:17.543 --> 37:21.179
told Roy that Brigit
was better off dead.

37:22.682 --> 37:24.383
I woulda punched him too.

37:26.719 --> 37:27.753
You wouldn't've.

37:52.545 --> 37:55.648
Shit.

37:56.482 --> 37:57.416
Are you in position?

37:57.817 --> 37:59.552
<i>Patience
isn't one of your virtues,</i>

37:59.585 --> 38:00.586
<i>is it, Ben?</i>

38:05.223 --> 38:06.726
I spoke with Mrs. Baker.

38:07.293 --> 38:09.262
She doesn't want anything
to do with her daughter.

38:09.729 --> 38:11.597
<i>Adopted daughter, that is.</i>

38:12.298 --> 38:14.600
I've got eyes and ammo
on the house.

38:14.901 --> 38:16.636
Unless they don't
get through you...

38:18.404 --> 38:19.672
they ain't comin' through here.

38:20.138 --> 38:24.777
That's my call, don't fire till
I give the green light.

38:24.810 --> 38:27.112
Understood. Sheriff.

38:33.786 --> 38:35.621
Oh, fuck.

39:06.552 --> 39:07.553
Ben.

39:10.690 --> 39:11.791
We've got it under control.

39:12.458 --> 39:13.659
Doesn't look that way to me.

39:14.060 --> 39:15.328
Look Ben,
it's been a true pleasure

39:15.361 --> 39:16.662
working with you on this,

39:16.696 --> 39:17.830
but we got it from here.

39:19.065 --> 39:20.700
Why don't you and the kid go
set up a perimeter or some shit?

39:21.033 --> 39:22.768
Fuck off, Silas.

39:24.870 --> 39:25.671
Timeline.

39:26.137 --> 39:28.674
15 minutes to breach,
10 to wrap out.

39:29.308 --> 39:31.777
Rutledge wants this done
and we're here to handle it.

39:32.445 --> 39:35.781
Thank you for your service,
but you're on the bench.

39:35.815 --> 39:36.816
Let's go.

39:41.754 --> 39:43.823
Ben,
what the hell's happening here?

39:44.323 --> 39:45.758
Dad sent a militia?

39:46.492 --> 39:48.594
You think you can
get inside the house?

39:50.296 --> 39:51.330
How?

39:51.764 --> 39:53.265
Hug the tree line.

39:53.666 --> 39:56.167
Wait. So you want me
inside the house

39:56.201 --> 39:57.837
so Silas
doesn't shoot the shit up?

40:00.205 --> 40:01.340
Something like that.

40:01.941 --> 40:03.876
A bloodbath won't do anything.

40:05.845 --> 40:07.212
You understand?

40:08.748 --> 40:09.715
All right.

40:10.148 --> 40:11.484
You ain't gonna do it,

40:11.884 --> 40:13.886
guess it's my time
to be the hero.

40:15.220 --> 40:16.322
It's my time.

40:33.806 --> 40:34.807
Say what?

40:35.941 --> 40:36.909
You want me to do what?

40:37.710 --> 40:38.878
Get up on in here?

40:39.745 --> 40:41.947
Okay. I can do that.

40:42.915 --> 40:44.350
Jesus be with me.

40:45.951 --> 40:47.920
We're doing
the Lord's work here.

40:48.821 --> 40:49.889
Okay.

40:49.922 --> 40:52.324
Brigit told me
Toby was going off the deep end,

40:52.358 --> 40:54.427
but that guy needs help.

40:54.927 --> 40:56.762
He went downhill after Brigit.

40:57.096 --> 40:59.498
Last year he went to
a donnybrook in Alabama,

40:59.765 --> 41:01.934
said he partied
and got a weird bump of coke.

41:04.837 --> 41:07.940
Grace.
Didn't you want to be a dancer?

41:09.909 --> 41:12.778
Whatever happened to that
Grace Baker used to...

41:13.279 --> 41:14.980
sell Girl Scout cookies
door to door?

41:15.281 --> 41:17.416
She learned to fight
and shoot a gun.

41:19.752 --> 41:22.488
Must have been real hard
growing up in Brigit's shadow.

41:24.356 --> 41:25.825
She was wicked smart.

41:26.792 --> 41:28.894
I helped her write
some of her college application.

41:31.430 --> 41:34.834
I even helped her win that
full ride scholarship to Yale.

41:35.768 --> 41:37.903
Broke my heart
when Charles convinced her to...

41:38.304 --> 41:40.272
join the town business.

41:41.974 --> 41:43.609
Brigit was a good kid.

41:44.443 --> 41:46.011
One of the greatest kids
you could hope for

41:46.045 --> 41:47.680
coming out of a foster home.

41:50.082 --> 41:51.817
She always looked out for you.

41:52.985 --> 41:54.353
Didn't she?

41:56.956 --> 41:58.324
You and Toby?

42:00.659 --> 42:02.361
Your caseworks failed you.

42:03.729 --> 42:06.732
But the three of you?
You always had each other.

42:07.900 --> 42:08.901
That's good.

42:10.402 --> 42:11.670
Nice.

42:14.907 --> 42:17.710
I had a foster kid once.
Didn't work out.

42:17.977 --> 42:20.646
Of course, that was
back when the state paid you

42:20.679 --> 42:22.715
good money
to take care of bastards.

42:22.748 --> 42:23.783
Do you hear yourself?

42:24.150 --> 42:25.851
Does that sound like
a normal thing to say?

42:26.886 --> 42:31.724
Some of those kids, their
family tree looked like circles.

42:34.360 --> 42:37.296
Grace. I want you to know.

42:38.931 --> 42:42.802
Just because your own family
abandoned you doesn't mean

42:42.835 --> 42:44.370
you have to give up on yourself.

42:45.971 --> 42:47.940
All this hate,

42:49.041 --> 42:50.876
all this anger...

42:53.379 --> 42:55.548
Brigit would have wanted you
to forget her.

42:57.616 --> 42:58.951
Well, I try.

42:59.252 --> 43:02.054
- What? You try?
- Shut up.

43:02.822 --> 43:03.889
You try?

43:03.923 --> 43:05.024
That's not what I meant.

43:05.057 --> 43:07.393
What'd you mean then?
Enlighten us.

43:09.028 --> 43:14.400
I've spent 10 years trying
to move on, Roy. 10 years.

43:14.867 --> 43:20.105
And I feel guilty,
but I want to forget her. I do.

43:20.940 --> 43:24.777
I try so hard, but my mind
just doesn't let me sleep.

43:24.810 --> 43:27.980
And I keep thinking about what
these sick fucks did to her!

43:28.547 --> 43:30.416
And I just wanna sleep.

43:31.784 --> 43:33.452
I need to know
what happened, Roy.

43:35.821 --> 43:38.424
I'm tired of visiting
an empty grave.

43:41.627 --> 43:43.729
I spent 10 years in prison.

43:44.029 --> 43:46.966
I lost my career.
I lost everything.

43:47.600 --> 43:50.769
No one cared. Except for you.

43:51.971 --> 43:53.973
You and the memory of her.

43:54.473 --> 43:56.542
That's all that kept me sane.

43:56.575 --> 43:57.476
Okay, well try being free

43:57.509 --> 43:59.712
and not being able
to do anything about it

43:59.745 --> 44:02.014
because I made your stupid ass
a promise

44:02.047 --> 44:04.416
that I would wait until
you got out to do shit.

44:04.817 --> 44:06.552
And every soul
from God to the devil

44:06.585 --> 44:09.455
knows that Grace Baker
keeps her word.

44:10.389 --> 44:13.425
I swore on Brigit's grave
that I would kill anyone

44:13.459 --> 44:16.128
who had anything to do
with her disappearance.

44:16.161 --> 44:19.732
If I find out that you had
anything to do with it,

44:19.765 --> 44:21.133
God fucking help you,

44:21.334 --> 44:23.535
I kill you myself.

44:45.124 --> 44:46.792
Shit.

44:47.294 --> 44:48.494
You hear that?

44:52.831 --> 44:54.033
Toby, do you hear that?

45:09.181 --> 45:12.184
- Who's inside?
- You got Roy,

45:12.551 --> 45:15.587
you got Grace,
and the dipshit cousin,

45:16.221 --> 45:17.589
I can't remember his name.

45:18.190 --> 45:20.225
Yeah, Toby Cavendish.
What a piece of shit.

45:20.693 --> 45:24.096
Toby Cavendish is nothing but
an all-American loser.

45:24.830 --> 45:27.866
I heard he tried
to start a gun store and failed.

45:28.534 --> 45:31.136
Who the fuck can't make money
owning a gun store in Georgia?

45:31.737 --> 45:34.006
Are we just
doing surveillance for now?

45:34.240 --> 45:37.042
'Cause this drone could knock
real loud if it needs to.

45:37.543 --> 45:40.179
You're not doing
a fucking drone strike.

45:40.546 --> 45:42.248
You're gonna kill Keats.

45:43.716 --> 45:46.852
Rutledge authorized it,
so we're doing it.

45:50.055 --> 45:52.057
Yo,
didn't Toby and Grace enlist?

45:52.725 --> 45:55.561
Yeah, I heard that too.

45:56.262 --> 45:57.963
Then they washed out.

46:13.279 --> 46:14.747
- You find anyone?
- No.

46:21.020 --> 46:22.121
What is that?

46:22.154 --> 46:23.356
Called a drone, convict.

46:23.390 --> 46:27.226
Or in the language of my people,
we call it target practice.

46:37.303 --> 46:38.271
Come on!

46:46.312 --> 46:52.117
Oh, what a strange toy that
is for grown men.

46:54.219 --> 46:55.754
All right,
we're gonna take this house.

46:55.788 --> 46:57.689
We don't need robots.
You got it?

46:59.292 --> 47:01.693
Charles didn't
exactly send his finest minds.

47:02.027 --> 47:03.229
The hell was that?

47:04.264 --> 47:06.031
What? Why are you smiling?

47:06.332 --> 47:08.301
That wasn't a drone,
that was a drone-drone.

47:08.334 --> 47:10.869
They must've packed that TNT
or some shit,

47:10.903 --> 47:13.072
'cause I only shot it
with my .556.

47:14.773 --> 47:17.343
That means they think
you're expendable, John Keats.

47:17.377 --> 47:20.646
Well, that's fascinating.

47:21.980 --> 47:23.982
How about that, Doctor Keats?

47:24.616 --> 47:28.187
Who's more scary now?
Us or them?

47:28.220 --> 47:29.322
Last time I saw Brigit,

47:30.523 --> 47:31.291
she was getting into the back
of the sheriff's cruiser.

47:31.324 --> 47:34.327
They were taking her away,
I swear.

47:40.899 --> 47:42.201
Put it on speaker.

47:49.409 --> 47:50.477
Yeah?

47:50.510 --> 47:51.210
<i>Why does Doctor Keats say that</i>

47:51.244 --> 47:52.545
you know
what happened to Brigit?

47:52.579 --> 47:56.682
<i>Me? I hardly
know my way to the station.</i>

47:57.350 --> 47:59.718
What possible reason
would I have?

48:00.453 --> 48:04.390
Doctor Keats said he saw her
in your police cruiser.

48:04.424 --> 48:07.626
<i>10 years ago?
I blacked out drunk.</i>

48:08.361 --> 48:09.229
If you ain't
trying to hide anything,

48:09.262 --> 48:10.996
why are you sending
drone-drones, huh?

48:11.029 --> 48:12.332
Trying to turn this into Waco?

48:12.698 --> 48:15.200
<i>No more bloodshed,
okay? Please.</i>

48:15.634 --> 48:17.903
<i>I don't know
what happened to Brigit.</i>

48:20.005 --> 48:21.374
<i>Grace, you hear me?</i>

48:24.444 --> 48:25.644
Ah.

48:26.778 --> 48:31.351
I don't... I... I investigated it
and it's... it's tough.

48:32.485 --> 48:35.355
<i>I put together
a list of suspects.</i>

48:35.787 --> 48:38.957
<i>On the top of the list,
Roy Lambert.</i>

48:39.725 --> 48:40.759
Bullshit!

48:41.960 --> 48:45.331
When he assaulted Charles,
it gave us a way to lock him up.

48:45.365 --> 48:47.833
- It's bullshit.
- <i>Charles insisted</i>

48:47.866 --> 48:50.936
<i>we stop the investigation
after Roy's conviction</i>

48:51.337 --> 48:53.071
<i>to keep the community safe.</i>

48:53.105 --> 48:56.476
<i>And around here, whatever
Charles wants, he gets.</i>

48:56.509 --> 48:58.777
- Anything else?
- Just....

48:59.512 --> 49:02.348
<i>let Doctor Keats go.</i>

49:02.382 --> 49:05.318
<i>Nobody else
needs to die today.</i>

49:07.019 --> 49:08.321
Christ.

49:11.491 --> 49:13.058
They fucking set me up.

49:13.692 --> 49:16.396
She was the best girl
that I ever met.

49:16.962 --> 49:18.764
She was too good for me.

49:19.432 --> 49:21.767
But you know there's no way
I could have done this.

49:23.269 --> 49:24.470
She was too good for you.

49:24.504 --> 49:25.471
She was.

49:26.439 --> 49:28.073
She really wants.

49:29.107 --> 49:30.142
Christ.

49:30.343 --> 49:31.477
I know you didn't kill Brig.

49:32.144 --> 49:34.247
- Thanks.
- You're too much of a pussy.

49:34.947 --> 49:38.050
Now, I definitely know
they're hiding something,

49:38.083 --> 49:39.818
so, Toby, get that door down.

49:40.520 --> 49:41.321
What the hell you think

49:41.354 --> 49:43.121
I've been trying to do,
little sister?

49:43.155 --> 49:44.890
Trying ain't doing, is it,
big brother?

49:46.459 --> 49:48.026
Some things can't be unseen.

49:49.462 --> 49:50.796
If you get through that door,

49:52.130 --> 49:53.399
everything changes.

49:58.103 --> 49:59.472
I told y'all!

50:00.939 --> 50:05.143
I'mma get in that door
right now. You hear me?

50:32.538 --> 50:36.208
Holy shit. Charles Rutledge
actually showed up.

50:36.576 --> 50:39.044
I'll say my plan is working.

50:40.012 --> 50:41.213
Your plan?

50:47.253 --> 50:48.521
Status.

50:49.355 --> 50:52.924
Boys are preppin' now.
We've only got to do this once.

50:53.626 --> 50:55.528
How did
your delicate approach go?

50:56.061 --> 50:59.265
It's goin'. Kyle's inside now.

50:59.465 --> 51:00.366
What?

51:00.400 --> 51:02.067
What the fuck did you just say?

51:02.702 --> 51:04.370
There was no stopping him.

51:05.070 --> 51:08.106
- He overpowered me.
- Don't get it, do you?

51:09.207 --> 51:10.543
Negotiating with them,

51:11.209 --> 51:13.413
announces to every
goddamn degenerate

51:13.680 --> 51:16.549
that all they have to do
to get ahead in this world

51:16.749 --> 51:18.618
is point a gun in a man's face

51:18.651 --> 51:20.353
that works for a living.

51:21.387 --> 51:23.489
No. Those are assholes.

51:24.590 --> 51:25.924
They have a different mindset.

51:26.492 --> 51:29.462
Now you sent my only son
in there to deal with them.

51:36.001 --> 51:38.471
Marisa? Got eyes on Kyle?

51:40.138 --> 51:44.876
Negative. I can't see him.
He's not with you?

51:46.579 --> 51:49.515
S'posed to be the babysitter,
fucking dumbass.

51:50.616 --> 51:52.285
I'm the sheriff of this county.

51:52.552 --> 51:54.019
Yes, you are.

51:55.488 --> 51:59.091
Don't forget who put you there,
who keeps you there.

51:59.592 --> 52:01.327
And who could put you
in the ground

52:01.361 --> 52:03.463
faster than a sparrow can shit.

52:04.062 --> 52:09.369
You're a burned out, washed up
disgrace to this town,

52:09.702 --> 52:14.574
and it's only by my patience and
the benevolence of the good Lord

52:15.207 --> 52:16.609
that you're still breathing.

52:17.109 --> 52:20.513
My family, they built this town.

52:21.179 --> 52:25.183
They toiled to make her great.
My blood is in every tree.

52:25.685 --> 52:28.454
My breath in every gust of wind.

52:29.255 --> 52:32.658
Couldn't make it
as a cop in New York or Atlanta

52:32.692 --> 52:35.361
or even as a security guard
in a fucking Walmart.

52:35.994 --> 52:39.632
You're a corrupt,
godless, divorced,

52:39.665 --> 52:42.934
deadbeat dad whose only children

52:43.269 --> 52:45.304
don't even call you
on your birthday.

52:45.772 --> 52:49.975
Yeah, you're the sheriff.
What are you doing?

52:50.543 --> 52:52.278
Still thinking
you're the quarterback?

52:52.311 --> 52:53.312
Well, you're not.

52:53.679 --> 52:55.648
You're a fucking waste of space.

52:55.681 --> 53:00.486
You got me?
A fucking waste! Goddammit!

53:01.521 --> 53:03.188
- Are we clear?
- Yes.

53:03.523 --> 53:06.191
- Yes, what?
- Yes, sir.

53:06.224 --> 53:07.326
Good.

53:07.627 --> 53:09.194
Now you're relieved, Sheriff.

53:09.961 --> 53:13.232
- Thank you for your service.
- Stop fucking yelling at me.

53:14.132 --> 53:16.201
Gonna send you the money
you need for that boat

53:16.235 --> 53:17.570
you wanted so bad,

53:17.603 --> 53:19.405
then I never wanna
see you again.

53:19.672 --> 53:20.673
That's the deal.

53:21.474 --> 53:24.142
Good doing business with you,
now fuck off!

53:24.176 --> 53:25.578
Get the fuck outta here, Ben.

53:26.279 --> 53:27.547
Goddamn it, boy!

53:28.013 --> 53:32.685
Ben! That's my property over
there! You're fucking walking!

53:44.797 --> 53:46.632
Where the hell
is the sheriff going?

54:09.388 --> 54:10.723
They're making a play.

54:10.756 --> 54:12.425
Are they really
trying to kill me?

54:12.458 --> 54:14.594
Now we have to
keep you alive. Great.

54:15.126 --> 54:16.295
Me?

54:16.329 --> 54:17.396
They'll have to get in line.

54:18.631 --> 54:20.131
T, if you want to get in there,
you gotta do it yesterday.

54:24.537 --> 54:26.104
shit.

54:31.711 --> 54:34.680
I knew it. I'm in.

54:36.716 --> 54:38.684
That's what I'm talking about.

54:40.753 --> 54:43.789
Come on, Jesus.
Help me open this door.

54:49.094 --> 54:51.564
Hey Grace, I'm in.

55:05.278 --> 55:07.112
I can't see shit.

55:08.481 --> 55:10.115
Better not be aliens.

55:11.751 --> 55:13.519
All right, I'm going down.

55:16.455 --> 55:19.725
Stay with me now, JC.
Be with me.

57:44.470 --> 57:47.807
The feds are
23 minutes out, three SUVs.

57:59.285 --> 58:00.920
You're not
going to believe this.

58:01.787 --> 58:05.257
Turns out that Doctor Keats here
is cooking up more d-rugs

58:05.291 --> 58:07.493
below our feet than
Hunter S, Thompson could do

58:07.526 --> 58:08.961
in 1,000 lifetimes.

58:09.395 --> 58:14.533
You, my friends, are looking at
the Georgia Peach Pablo Escobar.

58:14.567 --> 58:16.268
- It's not what it looks like.
- Really?

58:16.669 --> 58:18.437
'Cause I saw enough d-rugs

58:18.471 --> 58:22.808
to make 1,000 pounds
of fentanyl, crystal, ecstasy.

58:22.842 --> 58:23.943
You name it.

58:24.477 --> 58:26.645
I was right, Grace,
this whole time.

58:26.912 --> 58:30.015
Me! I knew this, I was right,

58:30.049 --> 58:32.885
and y'all will never
hear the end of this.

58:33.586 --> 58:36.255
There's four incoming.
Grace, get upstairs.

58:36.489 --> 58:37.923
Yeah, well,
if you don't keep him alive,

58:37.957 --> 58:39.992
we won't live long enough
to hear the start of it.

58:42.895 --> 58:44.830
They're moving
to the side of the house, Grace.

58:46.966 --> 58:48.667
You're the devil.

58:54.740 --> 58:56.375
Are you making a move
on the house?

58:56.709 --> 58:59.011
<i>Little fucking heads up
would have been nice, Ben.</i>

58:59.445 --> 59:01.013
Ben is no longer sheriff.

59:01.680 --> 59:04.884
You get a shot at those SOBs,
you take it, you got me?

59:04.917 --> 59:06.585
<i>Oh, Mr. Rutledge.</i>

59:06.952 --> 59:08.921
Okay. Yes, sir.

59:16.562 --> 59:20.032
Oh, I can't wait to see
the faces of those FBI boys

59:20.065 --> 59:22.034
when they discover your stash.

59:59.939 --> 01:00:00.906
Are you kidding?

01:00:09.048 --> 01:00:12.051
I lit those fuckers up
like a Christmas tree.

01:00:17.122 --> 01:00:19.825
Come here! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:21.460
C'mere, c'mere, c'mere.

01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:24.697
Wait, wait, hold on.

01:00:24.997 --> 01:00:28.667
No? Yeah? Right?

01:00:28.968 --> 01:00:31.003
Drop it. Drop it!

01:00:31.036 --> 01:00:32.771
Shoot this fuck nugget!

01:00:34.006 --> 01:00:36.075
Hey, Keats.
What's goin' on?

01:00:36.675 --> 01:00:40.179
Did they get a call off? Huh?
Did they? Who'd you tell?

01:00:40.212 --> 01:00:41.380
I didn't tell 'em anything!

01:00:42.481 --> 01:00:43.582
No, that's bullshit.
I don't believe a word of it.

01:00:43.949 --> 01:00:46.752
I found out about
your cave of sin, though.

01:00:47.152 --> 01:00:49.655
How many people are in on it,
huh? The whole town?

01:00:50.155 --> 01:00:52.791
Oh, I think I know you.

01:00:53.225 --> 01:00:55.794
Aren't you little Callan Martin?

01:00:56.395 --> 01:00:58.063
You know
you couldn't even spell

01:00:58.097 --> 01:01:00.099
your own name till freshman
year!

01:01:00.132 --> 01:01:04.970
That's real rich coming from
the guy who wore a tin foil suit

01:01:05.004 --> 01:01:06.505
to his own graduation.

01:01:06.538 --> 01:01:08.107
Bet your parents
were real proud,

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:09.141
thinking that you're, what?

01:01:10.343 --> 01:01:12.111
The fucking NSA was scratching
the inside of your skull?

01:01:12.444 --> 01:01:13.579
You loony bin.

01:01:13.612 --> 01:01:16.015
That's pretty cocky from
the guy who's got a gun on him.

01:01:16.249 --> 01:01:18.217
No, no, the only person
who's gonna be fucking shooting

01:01:18.251 --> 01:01:19.618
anybody is gonna be me.

01:01:19.952 --> 01:01:22.054
I'm gonna blow
your fucking head off.

01:01:22.087 --> 01:01:23.689
And then I'm gonna take my time,

01:01:24.156 --> 01:01:26.625
interrogatin' all three of ya.

01:01:29.995 --> 01:01:31.897
Don't you fucking move.
I heard everything.

01:01:33.198 --> 01:01:34.667
Were you lyin'
about all that stuff

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.502
they were saying about
that bunker, Toby?

01:01:36.535 --> 01:01:38.103
I wish I was, Kyle.

01:01:39.939 --> 01:01:40.973
Get it off me.

01:01:41.006 --> 01:01:43.208
I'm the only cop here man,
it's time for you to go.

01:01:43.243 --> 01:01:45.245
You get that fucking
gun out of my back, boy.

01:01:45.278 --> 01:01:48.013
You couldn't hit the broad side
of a barn.

01:01:48.213 --> 01:01:50.015
You wouldn't know your ass
from a hole in the ground!

01:01:50.049 --> 01:01:52.084
You are way
the fuck over your head,

01:01:52.117 --> 01:01:53.253
Callan, you know,
I'm warning you.

01:01:53.286 --> 01:01:54.354
No,
I'm gonna fucking tell you...

01:01:54.387 --> 01:01:56.689
Shut up. I mean,
you do not have to die here.

01:01:56.722 --> 01:01:57.923
Don't be a fucking hero.

01:01:57.957 --> 01:01:58.991
Get outta here, man.

01:01:59.024 --> 01:02:01.126
Your daddy's outside!

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:03.929
And the only person leaving
here alive is going to be me

01:02:03.963 --> 01:02:05.965
and possibly you unless
you fucking turn around

01:02:05.998 --> 01:02:07.032
right when you came out of...

01:02:07.066 --> 01:02:08.167
Grace!

01:02:41.301 --> 01:02:43.202
Never seen a dead body before.

01:02:57.016 --> 01:02:58.150
Roy.

01:02:59.018 --> 01:03:02.154
Get the phone.
Come on, Roy, on the double.

01:03:07.793 --> 01:03:09.862
<i>Callan, status report.</i>

01:03:09.895 --> 01:03:11.964
Morning, Daddy. I'm sorry.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.168
You hurt my boy...

01:03:16.735 --> 01:03:20.572
and I'll rain an unholy violence
down upon you Sodomites.

01:03:20.839 --> 01:03:24.710
Oh, we found your manufactorium
of iniquity, Charles.

01:03:25.278 --> 01:03:27.746
You are responsible
for what happens now.

01:03:28.113 --> 01:03:31.083
<i>Tell us everything that
you know about Brigit,</i>

01:03:31.116 --> 01:03:34.219
<i>or Kyle gets real familiar
with the inside of my gun.</i>

01:03:34.887 --> 01:03:38.190
You want to save your secrets
or your son?

01:03:47.933 --> 01:03:49.668
I have to give credit
where it's due.

01:03:51.271 --> 01:03:53.672
Those three
shot your boys to shit.

01:03:56.008 --> 01:03:57.142
Just a warm-up.

01:04:00.212 --> 01:04:01.814
We don't have time for games.

01:04:02.515 --> 01:04:06.985
Get in there. Get my son.
Kill the rest.

01:04:07.853 --> 01:04:08.921
You got it?

01:04:14.327 --> 01:04:18.063
Hey. How long
to get everybody to Keats's?

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.600
Okay.

01:04:45.391 --> 01:04:46.392
Yeah.

01:04:48.961 --> 01:04:50.195
Got it. On my way.

01:05:36.074 --> 01:05:38.010
That man
was here to kill us, Roy.

01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:42.147
You did the right thing.
Saved our lives.

01:05:43.383 --> 01:05:46.051
What happened to my sister?

01:05:48.354 --> 01:05:49.888
She's dead.

01:05:57.297 --> 01:06:00.199
That's all that matters.
She's dead.

01:06:00.732 --> 01:06:02.000
Who did it?

01:06:05.037 --> 01:06:06.439
It's not that simple.

01:06:08.106 --> 01:06:10.310
This all has something to do
with what you're cooking

01:06:10.343 --> 01:06:12.010
down in the dungeon, doesn't it?

01:06:12.312 --> 01:06:13.946
It was Brigit's idea.

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:17.849
She had a vision.

01:06:18.451 --> 01:06:20.219
Really owe it all to you, Toby.

01:06:20.253 --> 01:06:21.220
Bullshit.

01:06:22.422 --> 01:06:23.489
She was inspired by you.

01:06:26.459 --> 01:06:30.028
She saw you getting high
behind the group home.

01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:40.306
All you do is lie, Keats.

01:06:42.174 --> 01:06:43.309
And you, Grace.

01:06:45.478 --> 01:06:48.013
She saw how
unafraid you were of violence.

01:06:49.848 --> 01:06:53.852
She wanted to find something
that would bring you peace.

01:06:56.522 --> 01:06:58.023
But you need to understand.

01:06:59.525 --> 01:07:02.362
The future pharmaceuticals
is all for the taking.

01:07:03.463 --> 01:07:04.930
Once upon a time,

01:07:05.764 --> 01:07:11.003
cartels built their empires
strictly on marijuana.

01:07:11.404 --> 01:07:15.907
And then, they saw
the coastal elites and posers,

01:07:16.942 --> 01:07:18.244
their appetite for blow.

01:07:19.479 --> 01:07:21.381
Then the Brit Brigade brought E.

01:07:21.748 --> 01:07:25.551
<i>Brought it from the raves
to the clubs.</i>

01:07:28.254 --> 01:07:29.422
And the cartels...

01:07:30.523 --> 01:07:32.224
shifted to heroin.

01:07:33.992 --> 01:07:37.996
And oxycontin was being
prescribed wholesale.

01:07:40.165 --> 01:07:42.067
So the cartels innovated.

01:07:43.035 --> 01:07:46.872
Started to cut that demon drug,
fentanyl into every damn thing

01:07:47.573 --> 01:07:49.509
and everyone was
pitching a hissy fit.

01:07:52.878 --> 01:07:55.448
Not to mention
those gay vegans in Los Angeles

01:07:55.881 --> 01:07:58.451
worried about all the additives
in their orange juice,

01:07:58.484 --> 01:08:00.520
but they couldn't even pronounce
half the damn shit

01:08:00.553 --> 01:08:02.522
that was in their fucking drugs.

01:08:02.888 --> 01:08:05.057
Get to the point, Keats.

01:08:08.528 --> 01:08:13.299
She started off working for me
that summer stacking shelves.

01:08:14.634 --> 01:08:16.536
Within a month,
she was running the place.

01:08:19.037 --> 01:08:20.406
She would always ask me

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:24.410
mountains of questions
about...'bout the business.

01:08:26.912 --> 01:08:28.481
For a moment,
I thought she was...

01:08:29.081 --> 01:08:31.451
trying to figure out
how to create a meth lab.

01:08:33.653 --> 01:08:36.555
But I knew
she was smarter than that.

01:08:37.221 --> 01:08:40.460
You're not just cooking up
any old Dilaudid down there.

01:08:42.528 --> 01:08:45.430
- You're experimenting.
- Innovating!

01:08:46.666 --> 01:08:49.201
Brigit was a pioneer.

01:08:51.136 --> 01:08:52.537
She told me her idea.

01:08:55.274 --> 01:08:59.612
We needed capital to
build her labs, you know?

01:08:59.944 --> 01:09:02.348
<i>Pharmaceutical components
and shit like that.</i>

01:09:03.982 --> 01:09:05.451
<i>And I introduced her
to Charles.</i>

01:09:08.421 --> 01:09:12.492
I borrowed money for him.
Long time ago.

01:09:15.661 --> 01:09:17.129
<i>He liked Brigit's idea.</i>

01:09:19.163 --> 01:09:20.299
<i>He liked it a lot.</i>

01:09:25.304 --> 01:09:29.006
<i>We was already into
some shady shit, but...</i>

01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:31.444
<i>But what?</i>

01:09:34.145 --> 01:09:35.648
Charles is a diligent man.

01:09:38.618 --> 01:09:39.886
He wanted to know how this
new drug

01:09:39.917 --> 01:09:44.256
that would be the ecstasy of
the 2000s could be transported.

01:09:46.359 --> 01:09:49.094
Well, Brigit went out,

01:09:49.395 --> 01:09:50.929
did some research.

01:09:53.031 --> 01:09:54.400
She started to think that...

01:09:55.368 --> 01:09:59.171
traveling musicians...
would be the answer,

01:09:59.839 --> 01:10:02.575
and they would be the best way
to transport the new drug.

01:10:08.681 --> 01:10:10.148
<i>That's where you came in, Roy.</i>

01:10:11.149 --> 01:10:13.453
The only reason she was
at that bar that night, Roy,

01:10:13.486 --> 01:10:14.986
was to see what she could see.

01:10:16.756 --> 01:10:18.156
Then she'd sell you.

01:10:20.426 --> 01:10:21.627
<i>She used you.</i>

01:10:26.699 --> 01:10:27.733
<i>After you hit Charles,</i>

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:30.035
<i>you were the perfect Patsy
for him.</i>

01:10:31.102 --> 01:10:32.705
<i>Anyone who asked about Brigit,</i>

01:10:32.905 --> 01:10:36.776
<i>Charles could say that it
must have been her violent ex,</i>

01:10:36.809 --> 01:10:38.444
<i>even without evidence.</i>

01:10:39.211 --> 01:10:42.248
<i>He had an influence
everywhere, cops, judges.</i>

01:10:42.815 --> 01:10:44.717
<i>It was all too easy for him.</i>

01:10:45.518 --> 01:10:49.755
<i>And town drunk Sheriff Ben was
happy to look the other way.</i>

01:10:49.789 --> 01:10:52.157
<i>We all knew he was
the worst cop in the country.</i>

01:10:52.792 --> 01:10:54.627
<i>Couldn't even see
half the cops in the county</i>

01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:55.561
<i>were on Charles's payroll.</i>

01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:02.468
You're lyin'.
These are all lies.

01:11:02.802 --> 01:11:06.639
My dad's a good man.
He can't be doing this.

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:10.676
I have no reason to lie.

01:11:11.744 --> 01:11:12.411
Not anymore.

01:11:12.879 --> 01:11:17.350
So, you, Brigit, and Charles
were business partners?

01:11:17.650 --> 01:11:18.718
And Silas.

01:11:19.685 --> 01:11:21.354
There's always a Silas.

01:11:22.688 --> 01:11:24.323
<i>Someone to do
their dirty work.</i>

01:11:26.559 --> 01:11:28.327
As I started to make headway,

01:11:30.263 --> 01:11:31.597
Charles saw the potential.

01:11:34.433 --> 01:11:35.635
He got greedy.

01:11:38.771 --> 01:11:40.606
He invited Brigit here
one night.

01:11:43.242 --> 01:11:44.477
And she never made it.

01:11:52.818 --> 01:11:54.754
<i>Silas pulled her over
in the sheriff's cruiser.</i>

01:11:57.256 --> 01:11:58.691
<i>I never saw her again.</i>

01:12:04.864 --> 01:12:06.632
I don't know
what happened after that.

01:12:11.437 --> 01:12:12.772
I don't know
what happened after...

01:12:15.408 --> 01:12:16.742
<i>Meanwhile, Charles told Ben</i>

01:12:16.776 --> 01:12:17.843
<i>to stop the investigation.</i>

01:12:18.377 --> 01:12:20.178
<i>The town moved on.</i>

01:12:20.813 --> 01:12:23.649
<i>Everyone except you three
and me.</i>

01:12:24.884 --> 01:12:26.586
<i>Brigit was my apprentice.</i>

01:12:26.886 --> 01:12:28.354
<i>My friend.</i>

01:13:29.715 --> 01:13:31.450
Answer the phone, Ben.

01:13:32.418 --> 01:13:33.419
Fuck!

01:14:08.487 --> 01:14:09.789
Let's trade!

01:14:10.956 --> 01:14:13.292
We'll give you free passes out.

01:14:14.694 --> 01:14:15.928
Just give us Kyle.

01:14:17.596 --> 01:14:19.197
We'll stand down.

01:14:21.934 --> 01:14:23.602
Give you my word.

01:14:26.372 --> 01:14:27.807
I'll corroborate everything.

01:14:28.274 --> 01:14:30.242
You just gotta wait for
the FBI boys to get here

01:14:30.276 --> 01:14:32.778
and I'll... I'll back everything
you say, I swear.

01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:35.815
Does the sheriff know
about Brigit?

01:14:36.649 --> 01:14:38.384
No, no.

01:14:38.417 --> 01:14:41.320
We keep the sheriff and Kyle
in the dark about everything.

01:14:41.821 --> 01:14:44.356
It's good cover for Charles
to have a son as a deputy.

01:14:44.857 --> 01:14:46.792
Everybody knows
that Kyle's a dumbass.

01:14:48.694 --> 01:14:50.863
My dad's a man of his word.

01:14:52.465 --> 01:14:53.799
You just let me go and he'll...

01:14:54.266 --> 01:14:56.969
he'll let you guys free,
I... I promise.

01:15:03.743 --> 01:15:06.011
You best keep your word, Kyle.

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:08.881
You hear me?

01:15:14.687 --> 01:15:18.858
Get outta here. Get!
Run to your daddy.

01:15:26.031 --> 01:15:27.500
I'm sorry.

01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:32.571
I don't know what for, but...

01:15:33.739 --> 01:15:34.740
I'm sorry.

01:15:53.359 --> 01:15:55.027
Walk to me, son.

01:15:59.131 --> 01:16:00.666
You gonna keep your promise?

01:16:06.672 --> 01:16:08.641
You gave your word
you'd let them go.

01:16:09.742 --> 01:16:10.910
Come on, now.

01:16:12.511 --> 01:16:14.013
Just a little further.

01:16:15.481 --> 01:16:17.082
Don't be a pigeon of peace, son.

01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:38.971
You're gonna let them go.

01:16:42.575 --> 01:16:45.878
- Doctor Keats alive?
- He is.

01:16:48.113 --> 01:16:49.815
Let them pass.

01:16:51.150 --> 01:16:52.952
Let them pass
or when the FBI arrive,

01:16:52.985 --> 01:16:54.053
I'll tell 'em everything.

01:16:58.824 --> 01:16:59.959
You don't mean that.

01:17:03.162 --> 01:17:04.430
I swear it.

01:17:06.098 --> 01:17:07.666
I swear on my life.

01:17:08.301 --> 01:17:10.035
On Mom's grave, I swear it.

01:17:52.878 --> 01:17:56.515
What are they doing?
No, no! Get me outta here.

01:17:57.082 --> 01:17:58.150
Fucking kidding me?

01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:02.154
Get this done.

01:18:02.621 --> 01:18:05.925
Kill them all, burn the lab.
FBI is 8 minutes out.

01:18:22.107 --> 01:18:23.075
Cut him loose, Roy.

01:18:25.044 --> 01:18:27.146
If we can get to the lab,
we may be able to hold them off.

01:18:43.296 --> 01:18:45.030
Keats got hit!

01:18:45.464 --> 01:18:46.765
Toby, he's hit!

01:20:17.589 --> 01:20:19.158
<i>Marisa, it's me.</i>

01:20:19.792 --> 01:20:23.162
<i>Don't shoot the kids.
This is on Charles.</i>

01:20:36.208 --> 01:20:37.209
Get my gun!

01:21:02.768 --> 01:21:04.337
<i>Stay in your lane, Sheriff.</i>

01:21:06.672 --> 01:21:08.207
<i>What, are you trying to
be a hero now?</i>

01:21:16.715 --> 01:21:18.784
Hey. Hey!

01:21:20.386 --> 01:21:21.186
Stop!

01:21:23.956 --> 01:21:26.191
Let's get these fuckers
for Toby.

01:21:30.463 --> 01:21:32.398
<i>You're a fucking
waste of space.</i>

01:22:00.460 --> 01:22:02.262
Hold still, motherfucker.

01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:18.877
Hey!

01:22:19.312 --> 01:22:21.146
Where the fuck d'you think
you're going?

01:22:34.826 --> 01:22:38.931
Ben. How come shit
always lands on top?

01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:41.967
It's over, Charlie.

01:22:50.142 --> 01:22:51.810
Do you regret anything?

01:23:15.301 --> 01:23:17.869
<i>If anyone is still
breathing in there, it's over.</i>

01:24:50.330 --> 01:24:51.431
Christ.

01:24:52.498 --> 01:24:54.099
How much did you know?

01:24:55.133 --> 01:24:57.637
It was Keats and Charles.

01:24:57.670 --> 01:24:59.339
Keats ran the drugs.

01:24:59.372 --> 01:25:00.972
But Silas killed Brigit.

01:25:01.006 --> 01:25:02.342
He had your car that night.

01:25:02.375 --> 01:25:04.076
I should have done more.

01:25:04.377 --> 01:25:05.578
Yeah, you fucking should have.

01:25:06.078 --> 01:25:07.447
And now you're bleeding.

01:25:08.448 --> 01:25:09.549
It ain't my blood.

01:25:10.483 --> 01:25:11.584
You sure about that?

01:25:12.452 --> 01:25:17.357
The feds are almost here.
So go, you're free.

01:26:10.410 --> 01:26:11.511
Marisa.

01:26:13.145 --> 01:26:14.480
You were never here.

01:26:19.552 --> 01:26:22.321
<i>If anyone asks,
I found a drug den.</i>

01:26:24.222 --> 01:26:25.525
<i>Fought off the army.</i>

01:26:27.993 --> 01:26:29.495
I'm the hero.

01:26:30.596 --> 01:26:32.298
Big shiny hero.
