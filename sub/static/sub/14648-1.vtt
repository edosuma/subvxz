03:37.010 --> 03:39.596
<i>July 18, 1870.</i>

03:39.762 --> 03:42.473
<i>On the eve of the Franco-Prussian War,</i>

03:42.640 --> 03:46.728
<i>Napoleon III and General Bazaine
pay a secret visit</i>

03:46.895 --> 03:50.064
<i>to a young scientist, Gustave Franklin.</i>

04:03.119 --> 04:04.871
So, Gustave,

04:05.038 --> 04:06.414
is my serum ready?

04:06.748 --> 04:10.835
Your Majesty, my research
yielded surprising results.

04:11.169 --> 04:15.506
The serum altered my subjects,
but not the way I expected.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.051
You'll see, it's extraordinary.

04:18.301 --> 04:20.011
Rodrigue! ChimÃ¨ne!

04:20.178 --> 04:21.846
Don't be shy, kids.

04:22.013 --> 04:24.015
Say hello to the Emperor.

04:32.774 --> 04:34.400
- Hello to the Emperor!
- Hello to the Emperor!

04:34.609 --> 04:36.402
Those animals talk?

04:36.486 --> 04:38.196
- Yes, they're...
- Invincible?

04:38.279 --> 04:40.114
- No...
- Don't mess with me, Gustave!

04:40.281 --> 04:43.868
Where's the Ultimate Serum
to make my soldiers invincible?

04:44.035 --> 04:45.203
War is coming.

04:45.495 --> 04:49.248
You promised me a secret weapon,
and all I see are two freaks!

04:49.624 --> 04:51.834
I have no time for silly games.

04:52.043 --> 04:54.295
Bazaine! Shoot those things.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.881
Too bad if they're not invincible!

04:57.048 --> 04:58.216
Yes, Your Majesty!

04:58.299 --> 04:59.967
No, wait!

05:24.075 --> 05:25.785
- Boom!
- Boom?

05:36.421 --> 05:39.590
There, there... Sleep, Prosper.

05:39.757 --> 05:42.635
That's just Daddy working.

05:48.057 --> 05:53.271
<i>And that's how Napoleon III,
Emperor of France, met his end.</i>

05:54.147 --> 05:57.942
<i>The next day, his son Louis-Napoleon
becomes Napoleon IV</i>

05:58.067 --> 06:01.279
<i>and signs a peace treaty with Prussia.</i>

06:01.446 --> 06:03.114
<i>The course of history is changed.</i>

06:03.281 --> 06:05.450
<i>The war of 1870 never happens,</i>

06:05.616 --> 06:09.412
<i>and the Napoleon dynasty continues
to reign over France.</i>

06:09.954 --> 06:11.998
<i>Several years later, all over the world,</i>

06:12.165 --> 06:15.334
<i>scientists mysteriously begin to disappear.</i>

06:15.543 --> 06:18.963
<i>Police throughout the world are stumped.</i>

06:19.130 --> 06:23.634
<i>No one knows what happened
to Branly, Einstein, Hertz,</i>

06:23.801 --> 06:25.678
<i>Marconi, Nobel, Pasteur</i>

06:25.845 --> 06:28.681
<i>and so many other
promising young scientists.</i>

06:28.848 --> 06:30.391
<i>With the best scientists gone,</i>

06:30.558 --> 06:33.561
<i>the world is forced
to rely on outdated science,</i>

06:33.728 --> 06:36.230
<i>deprived of electricity, radio, television</i>

06:36.397 --> 06:39.567
<i>and dozens of other important inventions.</i>

06:39.734 --> 06:44.655
<i>Without oil or the atom,
humanity relies massively on coal.</i>

06:44.822 --> 06:49.035
<i>The mines run dry
and coal is replaced by charcoal.</i>

06:49.243 --> 06:53.247
<i>European forests are flattened,
and an energy crisis ensues.</i>

06:53.414 --> 06:59.212
<i>The French Empire fights the Americas
for control of Canadian forest land.</i>

06:59.420 --> 07:03.925
<i>To win this war, the Empire needs scientists
to improve its weaponry.</i>

07:04.175 --> 07:08.346
<i>Its best policemen pursue
the few who haven't disappeared</i>

07:08.471 --> 07:10.807
<i>and refuse to work for the army.</i>

07:10.973 --> 07:12.683
<i>Thus, 70 years later,</i>

07:12.850 --> 07:16.687
<i>Gustave's son, Prosper Franklin,
and his son Paul,</i>

07:16.854 --> 07:20.274
<i>are in hiding to pursue Gustave's research.</i>

07:20.441 --> 07:22.985
<i>They are fugitives now, in 1931,</i>

07:23.152 --> 07:26.572
<i>with the world still stuck in the Age of Steam!</i>

07:31.577 --> 07:36.207
April and the Twisted World

08:02.733 --> 08:03.734
Dad?

08:04.318 --> 08:05.736
I knew I'd find you here.

08:05.903 --> 08:09.240
I can't help it. I need to see it every day.

08:09.407 --> 08:12.743
I know, it's the last one
and reminds you of before.

08:12.910 --> 08:16.414
But today we have something important
to finish.

08:16.581 --> 08:18.374
It's risky to come here.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.209
They'll capture you!

08:20.376 --> 08:23.421
I keep telling you, I can't help it.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.844
5 cents a song! 5 cents!

08:30.261 --> 08:31.262
Please!

08:38.477 --> 08:41.856
<i>Charge forth!
Soldiers of our Empire</i>

08:41.939 --> 08:45.234
<i>Raise your swords
The enemy must perish!</i>

08:45.318 --> 08:48.654
<i>Charge forth!
Mow them down without a frown!</i>

08:48.946 --> 08:52.199
<i>Shoot fearlessly
For our future</i>

08:52.366 --> 08:55.369
<i>Full steam ahead
We will cross</i>

08:55.536 --> 08:58.915
<i>The ocean
To wage the final battle</i>

08:59.081 --> 09:02.084
<i>As the bugles blare
And the bullets fly</i>

09:02.251 --> 09:05.171
<i>Their forests will be ours!
Their charcoal will be ours!</i>

09:27.818 --> 09:29.904
Don't tell Annette.

09:31.155 --> 09:32.406
I never do.

09:45.294 --> 09:46.671
Inspector, they're back!

09:46.837 --> 09:49.131
We can nab the whole family.

09:51.133 --> 09:54.136
Officer, it took us weeks to track them down.

09:54.303 --> 09:57.473
Give me 10 more minutes to finish my nap.

10:05.690 --> 10:07.358
Prosper, where've you been?

10:08.109 --> 10:09.568
I had to mix it myself!

10:09.735 --> 10:12.905
I'm Pops! And it's none of your business.

10:13.114 --> 10:15.199
Annette, darling!

10:15.366 --> 10:18.202
You two can argue another time.

10:18.369 --> 10:20.413
This is supposed to be the big day!

10:20.496 --> 10:21.497
Filtration?

10:22.540 --> 10:23.541
Ready.

10:24.542 --> 10:26.168
Enzymatic insertion?

10:28.879 --> 10:29.880
Done.

10:30.464 --> 10:31.799
Molecular hybridization?

10:31.966 --> 10:33.009
Successful.

10:37.930 --> 10:39.557
Mutagenic agent injection?

10:39.724 --> 10:40.766
Injecting.

10:48.399 --> 10:50.026
Emulsions 1 and 2?

10:50.276 --> 10:51.402
Here they are!

10:52.069 --> 10:53.738
April, not now!

10:53.946 --> 10:55.740
Are we gonna mix this thing?

10:55.906 --> 10:57.742
Buttercup, the best way to help us

10:58.075 --> 11:01.245
is to stay put and not touch anything.

11:02.455 --> 11:03.539
Where were we?

11:03.706 --> 11:05.750
- Emulsions 1 and 2?
- Here.

11:05.916 --> 11:08.753
- Hydrostatic pressure?
- Good, stable...

11:08.919 --> 11:10.379
Stop making that face!

11:10.546 --> 11:13.215
Come play. Forget stinky old chemistry!

11:13.382 --> 11:16.177
Darwin, chemistry is what made you talk.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.638
You're proud of your parents?
It was a failed experiment.

11:19.805 --> 11:22.683
I was supposed to be an invincible cat!

11:22.850 --> 11:25.269
This time, if we got it right,

11:26.604 --> 11:27.605
we've created

11:29.648 --> 11:31.358
the Ultimate Serum!

11:33.944 --> 11:35.821
The Ultimate Serum!

11:36.155 --> 11:39.450
All forms of life will be invincible.

11:39.617 --> 11:43.746
Sickness, old age and death will be no more.

11:44.997 --> 11:48.459
A more worthy goal
than invincible soldiers, Grandpa.

11:48.959 --> 11:53.130
We made the same mistakes as you,
but today we will finally succeed.

11:53.297 --> 11:55.466
We can now test on our guinea pig.

11:55.633 --> 11:56.634
Prosper, please...

11:56.759 --> 11:58.511
Pops, I'm Pops!

12:05.017 --> 12:06.644
<i>Inspector Pizoni here!</i>

12:07.103 --> 12:08.270
<i>Imperial Security!</i>

12:08.521 --> 12:10.815
<i>We've got you surrounded!</i>

12:11.107 --> 12:12.817
Remember, I want them alive.

12:13.109 --> 12:15.820
<i>You're under arrest for breaking the law!</i>

12:15.986 --> 12:19.073
<i>All scientists must serve the Empire!</i>

12:20.074 --> 12:21.117
Open up!

12:21.367 --> 12:23.577
The serum! They mustn't get it!

12:23.661 --> 12:24.662
Open up!

12:25.162 --> 12:26.163
The trapdoor, quick!

12:28.707 --> 12:29.875
Come on! Hurry!

12:30.835 --> 12:32.586
- Pops!
- I'll distract them.

12:32.753 --> 12:35.256
Meet you at the Steam Mobile! Get going!

12:39.718 --> 12:40.845
Hands up!

12:41.470 --> 12:42.471
My pleasure.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.038
Surprise!

13:11.834 --> 13:12.835
Hands up!

13:31.437 --> 13:32.438
Turn off the boiler.

13:32.605 --> 13:36.192
With the hands up it won't be easy.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.693
Will this help?

13:41.614 --> 13:43.908
The boiler! Aim for the boiler!

13:47.995 --> 13:49.079
Dad!

13:51.540 --> 13:52.625
Grandpa!

14:02.134 --> 14:03.302
Freeze!

14:18.150 --> 14:20.444
Get back here, you swine!

14:41.465 --> 14:43.300
Our only hope is the train station!

15:02.319 --> 15:04.113
Annette! April!

15:04.280 --> 15:05.823
You okay? Nothing broken?

15:05.990 --> 15:08.492
<i>Attention please, Platform 2.</i>

15:08.701 --> 15:12.079
<i>Immediate boarding for the 1:47 to Berlin.</i>

15:13.998 --> 15:16.583
There! Arrest them!
In the name of the Empire!

15:20.045 --> 15:21.255
Arrest them!

15:25.009 --> 15:28.012
<i>Platform 2, Paris-Berlin is leaving.</i>

15:43.944 --> 15:46.363
<i>Third-class passengers are forbidden</i>

15:46.530 --> 15:48.866
<i>to speak to other passengers.</i>

15:49.033 --> 15:52.453
<i>We wish you a pleasant voyage.</i>

15:52.619 --> 15:53.871
Farewell, Paris.

15:54.413 --> 15:55.456
What about Grandpa?

15:55.622 --> 15:59.251
He's smarter than the police,
I'm sure he's fine.

15:59.418 --> 16:02.046
In Berlin we'll find a way to contact him.

16:02.212 --> 16:05.758
There are police in Berlin, too.
We must hide the serum.

16:05.924 --> 16:06.967
Arrest them!

16:07.134 --> 16:08.886
In the name of the Empire!

16:31.158 --> 16:32.451
You dirty swine!

16:32.618 --> 16:34.995
Where are you hiding?

17:01.313 --> 17:02.439
The life baskets!

17:02.606 --> 17:03.899
Annette, quick!

17:07.569 --> 17:09.613
Close, you darn thing!

17:10.781 --> 17:12.282
Annette, what're you doing?

17:12.449 --> 17:13.867
Coming!

17:16.036 --> 17:17.913
Stop! Don't move!

17:18.247 --> 17:19.998
Party's over! You're under arrest.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.750
For real this time.

17:54.658 --> 17:55.701
April!

17:58.620 --> 18:00.247
Mom! Dad!

18:37.701 --> 18:39.036
A cable car destroyed!

18:39.203 --> 18:41.747
Prized scientists
we've been after for weeks, dead!

18:41.830 --> 18:42.789
IMPERIAL HOSPITAL

18:42.873 --> 18:45.542
Vaporized!
Like the passengers and your men.

18:45.709 --> 18:49.713
Prosper Franklin,
another prized scientist, missing!

18:49.880 --> 18:52.216
The girl is mute, useless to us.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.676
Pizoni, I ask you again, what happened?

18:54.843 --> 18:56.220
I already told you.

18:56.386 --> 18:59.473
A storm,
then everything blew to smithereens!

19:00.057 --> 19:03.185
It's the old schnook's fault!
I almost had them.

19:03.352 --> 19:05.187
Grandpa's gonna pay when I'm out!

19:05.604 --> 19:08.899
No more disasters!
No more hunting scientists!

19:09.233 --> 19:10.234
That's an order!

19:10.317 --> 19:15.197
When you're out, you'll catch
bums and potato thieves, Officer Pizoni!

19:15.822 --> 19:18.909
That's right, Officer.
You're an inspector no more!

19:27.584 --> 19:29.044
You can thank the Empire.

19:29.378 --> 19:32.506
You'll be cared for
and placed in an orphanage.

19:32.673 --> 19:35.425
They don't like head lice there.

20:03.287 --> 20:06.623
Halt! Police! I want a word with the little girl.

20:07.457 --> 20:10.919
Sorry about what happened to your parents.

20:11.086 --> 20:13.213
Tough break for you.

20:13.380 --> 20:16.216
But you still have your grandpa,
Prosper Franklin.

20:16.466 --> 20:18.427
You wanna find him, right?

20:20.721 --> 20:23.682
Come on, you must know where he is.

20:24.474 --> 20:27.436
Talk, say something! Cat got your tongue?

20:34.735 --> 20:35.986
Come back!

20:36.153 --> 20:37.696
Stop her!

20:50.667 --> 20:51.752
So?

20:51.835 --> 20:55.172
So nothing. She's gone. I give up.

20:57.883 --> 20:59.551
April Franklin!

20:59.718 --> 21:02.137
Hide all you like, I'll find you!

21:02.387 --> 21:04.514
And your grandpa, too!

21:04.681 --> 21:08.018
I'll throw him in the clink
and be an inspector again!

21:08.185 --> 21:09.853
Beware, Franklin family!

21:10.020 --> 21:13.774
Beware the wrath of Gaspard Pizoni!

21:25.035 --> 21:30.040
10 years later...

21:30.332 --> 21:32.084
<i>June 18, 1941.</i>

21:32.709 --> 21:34.961

<i>Rome. Another scientist

21:42.469 --> 21:44.846
<i>No trace of poor Enrico Fermi.</i>

21:44.930 --> 21:48.892
<i>Unrest in the Americas.

<i>Exciting rides and thrilling attractions await!</i>

22:22.092 --> 22:23.343
You like chemistry?

22:23.927 --> 22:25.095
Got anything recent?

22:25.554 --> 22:27.055
'Fraid not, little lady.

22:28.890 --> 22:31.184
Nothing new in science for a century.

22:31.268 --> 22:34.938
Right. Then I'll take that one.

22:35.105 --> 22:36.481
Consider it done.

22:41.278 --> 22:42.571
CHEMISTRY TREATY

22:49.244 --> 22:50.579
SUMMER FUNFAIR

22:52.164 --> 22:54.875
Watch where you're going!

22:55.041 --> 22:57.461
They should chuck you in prison!

23:21.860 --> 23:23.695
Pardon me, sorry!

23:49.054 --> 23:50.805
Dang it!

24:19.918 --> 24:21.044
I'm home!

24:23.088 --> 24:24.548
French poems

24:27.676 --> 24:28.843
Darwin!

24:28.927 --> 24:31.638
You know reading wears you out.

24:31.888 --> 24:33.598
I'll read to you, okay?

24:35.517 --> 24:37.060
What's it like outside?

24:37.227 --> 24:38.728
Same as always. War.

24:39.145 --> 24:41.314
Another scientist missing, in Rome.

24:41.481 --> 24:43.984
And there's a bridge
between England and France.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.569
Blasted soot!

24:48.363 --> 24:49.656
I got you this.

24:50.365 --> 24:51.908
And some glucose.

24:52.492 --> 24:54.578
Perrault, <i>Puss in Boots...</i>

24:55.036 --> 24:57.747
Thanks, but we have it. Did you forget?

24:58.498 --> 25:02.002
It was your favorite story
back when I read to you.

25:03.253 --> 25:05.755
Sorry, I had no time to choose.

25:07.424 --> 25:09.593
Darwin, what's Rome like?

25:09.759 --> 25:12.596
You should've retained
my geography lessons.

25:14.264 --> 25:16.349
There's more to life than chemistry.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.019
Rome is beautiful!

25:19.185 --> 25:20.687
The Colosseum.

25:21.771 --> 25:23.398
Bernini's Throne.

25:23.607 --> 25:25.400
I'll never see them.

25:26.109 --> 25:27.485
Don't be silly.

25:27.944 --> 25:29.154
April!

25:29.571 --> 25:33.241
Reading exhausts me, my head hurts.

25:35.577 --> 25:38.788
I've got more soot than air in my lungs.

25:40.457 --> 25:42.792
Soon, it'll smell better here.

25:43.209 --> 25:46.004
You won't have my litter box to clean.

25:46.963 --> 25:50.133
Nonsense! Your brain's overheating.

25:50.967 --> 25:52.177
I'll take your temperature.

25:52.344 --> 25:54.804
Leave my backside alone!

25:55.221 --> 25:57.432
My muzzle's hotter than yesterday,

25:57.515 --> 26:00.143
and my fever's not going down.

26:02.145 --> 26:04.981
I'll find that serum, and you'll get well!

26:05.315 --> 26:07.817
A new friend is what you should find.

26:07.984 --> 26:09.486
I don't need anyone.

26:12.405 --> 26:15.784
You're afraid
you'll meet someone and lose them.

26:17.160 --> 26:20.622
But cable cars
only blow up once in a lifetime.

26:22.999 --> 26:24.042
Sorry.

26:25.293 --> 26:26.294
It's ready.

26:26.378 --> 26:29.506
Drink this and shut your feline trap!

26:35.011 --> 26:36.054
How's the food?

26:37.347 --> 26:39.891
I come here mainly for the view. So?

26:40.308 --> 26:44.479
No news. She goes out daily to steal stuff.
Always alone.

26:44.562 --> 26:47.315
Never sees anyone.
And I can't find her hideout.

26:47.399 --> 26:51.277
I always lose her on that square.
She exits and enters, and poof!

26:52.862 --> 26:54.030
And the old guy, Prosper?

26:54.322 --> 26:57.450
I keep telling you! She never sees anyone.

26:57.617 --> 26:58.827
Why don't you let it go?

26:59.077 --> 27:01.579
You've hunted that old guy for 10 years.

27:01.746 --> 27:03.039
Hunt other scientists.

27:03.331 --> 27:06.835
I'm getting tired of tailing that girl.

27:07.001 --> 27:10.422
I'd rather spy on a prettier one.
She's no prize.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.298
Radishes or mushrooms?

27:12.549 --> 27:15.927
Listen up!
You're still green so I'll explain again.

27:16.094 --> 27:18.722
I'll nab Prosper if it takes 10 more years!

27:18.888 --> 27:21.057
Do the job or go back to jail!

27:21.391 --> 27:24.102
Punks like you are a dime a dozen.

27:25.186 --> 27:28.523
Calm down, I read you! What are my orders?

27:28.690 --> 27:29.899
One, find her hideout.

27:30.233 --> 27:34.028
Two, make sure
she doesn't get caught stealing.

27:34.195 --> 27:37.073
Three, let me eat in peace.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.242
You must've had a rough childhood.

27:39.451 --> 27:40.493
Get lost.

27:48.126 --> 27:51.045
THE FLYING PIGEON

27:51.421 --> 27:53.965
And the cat began to speak...

27:54.132 --> 27:57.343
"In return for your favor,
I will make you happy.

27:58.136 --> 28:02.432
"Give me just a bag and a pair of boots
and I will make your fortune."

28:02.599 --> 28:03.600
So?

28:04.726 --> 28:06.853
Sorry I didn't make your fortune.

28:07.061 --> 28:08.104
Dummy!

28:08.730 --> 28:09.773
How do you feel?

28:11.232 --> 28:12.942
The serum should've worked.

28:13.902 --> 28:15.445
If I may say,

28:16.112 --> 28:17.739
you should change your recipe.

28:18.031 --> 28:22.035
Molecular hybridization failed
due to incomplete polymerization.

28:22.285 --> 28:24.078
I didn't have enough reagents.

28:24.245 --> 28:25.455
Potassium permanganate,

28:25.622 --> 28:27.624
- dioxygen...
- In French, please.

28:27.999 --> 28:31.211
I didn't have enough of certain ingredients.

28:31.461 --> 28:32.962
But I know where to find them!

28:37.675 --> 28:39.677
Summer Funfair...

28:40.595 --> 28:43.890
"The Magic and Wonders of Chemistry."

28:44.307 --> 28:46.559
With any luck, I'll find what I need.

28:46.976 --> 28:48.186
I'm coming with you!

28:49.312 --> 28:51.648
In your condition? No way!

29:05.954 --> 29:10.083
<i>Come on down!
See the bearded Siamese twin ladies!</i>

29:10.250 --> 29:12.710
<i>Free admission for soldiers.</i>

29:18.508 --> 29:23.304
The Lovers' Carousel

29:32.188 --> 29:33.189
April!

29:34.691 --> 29:36.150
I'd love to dance.

29:36.359 --> 29:38.695
Cat's don't dance. Or talk!

29:38.862 --> 29:40.154
So keep quiet.

29:42.574 --> 29:45.201
And with the magic of boric acid...

29:45.368 --> 29:47.036
Abracadabra...

29:48.830 --> 29:52.000
A green flame! The color of hope!

29:54.043 --> 29:57.922
THE MAGIC AND WONDERS OF CHEMISTRY

29:58.131 --> 29:59.757
Thank you!

29:59.841 --> 30:02.719
I see you're itching to see the next miracle.

30:03.011 --> 30:05.179
Lithium, potassium, calcium...

30:05.346 --> 30:07.015
A fiery rainbow!

30:07.181 --> 30:08.433
Hop to it!

30:09.183 --> 30:10.476
April!

30:10.560 --> 30:11.603
He's coming!

30:13.271 --> 30:14.439
What the heck?

30:15.565 --> 30:16.774
Hurry up!

30:17.066 --> 30:18.234
I got you, missy!

30:22.071 --> 30:24.282
Stop her! Stop, thief!

30:29.370 --> 30:30.663
<i>Hurry up!</i>

30:31.831 --> 30:32.874
<i>Hurry up!</i>

30:33.041 --> 30:34.459
A talking cat!

30:34.626 --> 30:37.545
- Maximum surveillance, send in a rat-spy!
- Right away!

30:41.257 --> 30:42.258
Thief!

30:42.884 --> 30:44.510
Stop her!

30:46.137 --> 30:49.098
Honey, where've you been? I lost you!

30:51.643 --> 30:53.186
Open your purse!

30:54.187 --> 30:56.356
How dare you? Hands off my girlfriend!

30:56.522 --> 30:58.274
Better watch your girlfriend.

31:00.401 --> 31:03.237
If she weren't here I'd shove
that clown hat you know where!

31:03.404 --> 31:06.950
<i>Little lost Leopold awaits his mother
by the molten boiler.</i>

31:08.785 --> 31:10.954
Your tiger doesn't look so hot.

31:11.454 --> 31:13.289
I don't know what to say...

31:14.082 --> 31:15.041
Thanks.

31:15.124 --> 31:17.043
I think these are yours.

31:17.460 --> 31:18.586
Magic, eh?

31:18.753 --> 31:20.838
You do magic with this stuff, too?

31:20.922 --> 31:23.091
I'd love to see it, at your place.

31:23.508 --> 31:24.634
Listen...

31:24.801 --> 31:27.470
Thanks again,
but you wouldn't like my place.

31:27.553 --> 31:30.807
And I'm not alone. Better leave it at that.

31:41.776 --> 31:43.486
Filtration, good.

31:44.153 --> 31:47.323
Enzymatic insertion,
molecular hybridization,

31:47.657 --> 31:49.367
mutagenic agent injection...

31:49.534 --> 31:51.619
And colloidal solution, now!

31:52.745 --> 31:54.455
Oxidation-reduction...

31:55.748 --> 31:56.791
Glycolysis...

31:56.874 --> 31:59.127
Not quite what I wanted, but it could work.

31:59.502 --> 32:00.712
You could be cured!

32:26.029 --> 32:27.530
Come on, come on...

32:34.746 --> 32:37.081
What's it like to be kissed?

32:37.790 --> 32:39.459
Did he bite you?

32:40.293 --> 32:42.253
Lick your tongue?

32:43.296 --> 32:45.256
- Did you like it?
- Drink this.

32:45.631 --> 32:46.716
And shut up.

33:10.406 --> 33:12.200
It should be working.

33:12.867 --> 33:14.452
Do you feel anything?

33:14.619 --> 33:16.496
Thanks for a wonderful day.

33:19.665 --> 33:22.168
Now I can go...

33:22.335 --> 33:24.295
Go where? Silly sausage!

33:25.546 --> 33:27.465
I'll meet Homer,

33:27.632 --> 33:28.925
Plato,

33:29.092 --> 33:30.802
Shakespeare...

33:30.968 --> 33:32.637
Perrault, too.

33:32.804 --> 33:35.640
I have a thing or two to tell him about cats.

33:38.267 --> 33:40.978
April... I'm thirsty.

33:43.815 --> 33:44.899
Darwin?

33:45.817 --> 33:46.859
Darwin!

33:48.194 --> 33:51.280
It's your fault! Why'd I listen to you?

33:51.531 --> 33:54.784
You never should've gone out
in that rotten soot!

33:56.035 --> 33:58.871
And this... This is rotten, too!

34:01.749 --> 34:04.627
Everything's rotten, lousy, useless!

34:04.794 --> 34:05.962
Everything!

34:27.984 --> 34:30.653
CHEMISTRY AND COAL
THE MYSTERIES OF PARIS

34:46.460 --> 34:49.130
Don't expect me to clean up the mess!

34:50.214 --> 34:51.215
Darwin?

34:52.300 --> 34:54.010
You're cured?

34:54.260 --> 34:55.887
That tickles!

34:57.680 --> 34:59.015
How can it be?

34:59.182 --> 35:02.518
Here's your answer.
One sip and I'm fit as a fiddle!

35:02.685 --> 35:06.606
Hang on.
You drank this, and you're not sick anymore?

35:06.856 --> 35:10.193
Mom gave me this ball the last day I saw her.

35:11.986 --> 35:13.154
The serum!

35:13.529 --> 35:16.532
The last version they didn't have time to test!

35:16.699 --> 35:20.203
Somehow they injected it here
and you drank some.

35:21.037 --> 35:24.498
<i>My parents succeeded!
The Ultimate Serum works!</i>

35:24.874 --> 35:26.876
It's better than chicken soup!

35:27.043 --> 35:29.086
I feel like I swallowed a panther!

35:34.383 --> 35:35.843
You may applaud.

35:39.096 --> 35:40.765
What are you doing here?

35:40.932 --> 35:43.768
Nothing, just admiring the view! Help me!

35:48.940 --> 35:50.024
Thanks.

35:50.233 --> 35:52.026
Boy, was I scared!

35:52.193 --> 35:54.946
I almost peed in Napoleon's eye!

35:55.279 --> 35:56.739
So, Romeo?

35:56.906 --> 35:59.242
Love got you climbing the walls?

35:59.575 --> 36:00.660
Spying on me?

36:01.035 --> 36:02.370
I said to leave me alone.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.831
Is he part of your act?

36:07.583 --> 36:09.961
<i>- April, buttercup, it's Dad.</i>
- Dad?

36:10.127 --> 36:12.046
<i>Listen, I don't have much time.</i>

36:12.213 --> 36:13.965
<i>You're in danger. They're coming.</i>

36:14.423 --> 36:17.760
<i>Leave immediately. The oak!
Get to the oak, fast.</i>

36:17.927 --> 36:19.262
<i>With luck, you'll find...</i>

36:19.762 --> 36:20.763
Darwin!

36:22.014 --> 36:24.267
Sorry, instinct.

36:24.433 --> 36:25.851
Can't control it.

36:27.603 --> 36:29.355
What is this thing?

36:30.022 --> 36:31.065
How can it be?

36:31.274 --> 36:33.192
Dad... Alive?

36:33.859 --> 36:35.611
Something's going on outside.

36:49.417 --> 36:51.168
We have to leave. Now!

37:42.845 --> 37:44.680
Where are you going?

37:44.847 --> 37:48.142
Your place. A smart aleck like you
must sleep somewhere.

37:48.309 --> 37:50.686
You'll put us up for the night. Thanks!

37:51.312 --> 37:53.647
What? Got a problem?

37:53.856 --> 37:56.442
Don't like people dropping in unannounced?

37:56.776 --> 37:59.320
And don't get fresh! No more sharing saliva.

37:59.487 --> 38:02.198
Darwin will keep watch while I sleep.

38:07.995 --> 38:09.580
I think she likes you.

38:09.747 --> 38:10.998
Where do you live?

38:25.930 --> 38:28.182
- What happened?
- There you are!

38:28.265 --> 38:30.559
- Where's the rat?
- Got him, he's in the lab.

38:30.643 --> 38:35.231
What happened? We had the serum,
but she fled like she'd been warned.

38:35.398 --> 38:39.235
She was. Someone hijacked the rat-spy.

38:39.819 --> 38:41.904
Come, everything's ready.

38:42.071 --> 38:44.990
My love, you're too easy on those humans.

38:45.574 --> 38:48.911
The scientists have too much freedom.
Punish him.

38:49.078 --> 38:52.123
Brutality is against our principles.

39:03.801 --> 39:05.553
Paul Franklin, please rise.

39:06.804 --> 39:08.931
You erased your transmission.

39:09.098 --> 39:11.308
What'd you tell your daughter?

39:12.059 --> 39:16.147
You know the project could succeed,
with April's help.

39:16.313 --> 39:17.898
Where can we find her?

39:19.191 --> 39:23.320
You'll soon be smiling less and talking more.

39:23.487 --> 39:24.488
Rodrigue!

39:24.780 --> 39:26.449
Just a little intimidation.

39:26.615 --> 39:28.492
You don't want to tell us,

39:28.576 --> 39:31.078
but might be more chatty with someone else.

39:31.245 --> 39:32.830
You may enter now.

40:06.530 --> 40:08.491
Sweet!

40:10.451 --> 40:11.827
Do these pay the rent?

40:11.994 --> 40:15.498
I found them. I'm a collector.
Got a problem with that?

40:16.290 --> 40:18.834
Sleep there, I'll take the corner.

40:19.043 --> 40:21.712
There's the bucket for... You know what.

40:22.588 --> 40:24.840
Do you stand up or go like normal cats?

40:25.007 --> 40:27.801
I'm normal! I like my privacy.

40:35.267 --> 40:36.852
By the way, I'm Julius.

40:37.853 --> 40:39.313
Good night, Julius.

40:40.022 --> 40:42.316
What happened at the statue?

40:42.399 --> 40:43.484
No idea.

40:43.776 --> 40:45.402
Why does your cat talk?

40:45.569 --> 40:47.112
He just does.

40:47.279 --> 40:49.740
Was that rat like Darwin?

40:49.907 --> 40:51.325
I don't think so.

40:52.243 --> 40:53.536
Did you lose your parents?

40:53.827 --> 40:55.996
What's it to you? Why the questions?

40:56.497 --> 40:58.207
You're young,

40:58.332 --> 41:01.460
you live alone... I doubt it's for fun.

41:01.877 --> 41:03.254
I know how it is.

41:03.587 --> 41:06.257
I never knew who my dad and mom were.

41:07.925 --> 41:10.553
At least you don't know what you're missing.

41:11.011 --> 41:13.430
So, you've got nobody?

41:13.597 --> 41:16.392
A brother, an uncle, a grandfather?

41:16.642 --> 41:18.018
None of your business!

41:18.185 --> 41:19.979
Darwin and I are leaving tomorrow.

41:20.229 --> 41:22.731
You can go on collecting watches.

41:22.898 --> 41:24.400
Now let me sleep.

41:40.541 --> 41:43.586
I could help you. Think it over.

41:44.628 --> 41:47.339
I already told you, I don't need anyone.

41:49.383 --> 41:53.596
Thanks to him, you avoided arrest
and got your dad's message!

42:02.771 --> 42:06.108
Julius, do you know where
to find an oak in Paris?

42:06.275 --> 42:08.902
- A what?
- An oak. A tree.

42:09.445 --> 42:11.905
I know one place, just one.

42:23.459 --> 42:26.378
We've been here for hours.
What're we waiting for?

42:26.545 --> 42:28.339
I have no idea. Be quiet and wait.

42:28.422 --> 42:29.632
OAK (QUERCUS)

42:31.634 --> 42:34.637
"Some strains could live 1,100 years.

42:35.137 --> 42:38.015
"Oak trees were found throughout Europe.

42:38.182 --> 42:40.976
"Three specimens remain."

42:42.311 --> 42:43.479
Not interested?

42:43.646 --> 42:46.440
No, Dr. Darwin, the Boring Scientist!

42:47.274 --> 42:48.567
Don't look at me.

42:49.568 --> 42:51.195
Don't look at me!

42:51.362 --> 42:53.989
101 Bayonet Street in SÃ¨vres.

42:54.156 --> 42:56.200
To get in press "1931

42:56.283 --> 42:59.953
Stay here another hour. I must leave alone.

43:13.050 --> 43:15.052
What're you doing? He said to wait!

43:15.219 --> 43:16.762
Weren't you in a hurry?

43:18.806 --> 43:21.558
Annette!
I watched those screens for 10 years!

43:21.684 --> 43:25.312
I finally find April,
and you play cop for those wackos!

43:25.479 --> 43:28.691
Don't you realize
April has what we're looking for?

43:28.774 --> 43:32.444
Here, despite the best equipment
and biologists,

43:32.528 --> 43:34.363
we've failed every time.

43:34.571 --> 43:39.159
Thanks to her, and to the Ultimate Serum,
the project will become a reality!

43:42.246 --> 43:45.374
Where is April? What did you tell her?

43:47.501 --> 43:49.795
Paul, April will be safe here.

43:49.962 --> 43:52.631
We'll be a family again. We'll work together.

43:52.798 --> 43:55.300
Together? You don't want to find her.

43:55.634 --> 43:58.804
You want to recruit her for your sick dream!

43:58.929 --> 44:00.806
It used to be your dream, too.

44:00.973 --> 44:02.307
I woke up!

44:02.474 --> 44:04.560
April will not be safe here!

44:04.727 --> 44:08.897
There's no scientific proof
the project won't end in disaster!

44:08.981 --> 44:12.443
I'm sorry, I don't want my daughter
anywhere near this insanity.

44:13.110 --> 44:14.820
Our daughter.

44:24.079 --> 44:27.958
BOUTARDIEU BOILERS

44:51.482 --> 44:52.775
Anyone home?

45:10.250 --> 45:11.460
They're real!

45:12.544 --> 45:13.629
Did you see?

45:14.087 --> 45:15.088
April?

45:18.175 --> 45:19.718
Know where we are?

45:19.968 --> 45:21.011
Yes.

45:36.985 --> 45:38.153
April!

45:39.154 --> 45:41.949
Why didn't you wait like I told you?

45:43.283 --> 45:45.702
Ten years I've looked for you. Everywhere.

45:45.911 --> 45:49.248
Orphanages, hospitals... Even cemeteries!

45:49.456 --> 45:52.167
At the Memorial, I wasn't sure.

45:52.334 --> 45:54.503
But I saw Darwin and knew it was you!

45:55.587 --> 45:57.840
How you've grown!

45:58.173 --> 45:59.675
You too, Darwin.

46:00.384 --> 46:03.470
Look! I even bought some cakes.

46:04.638 --> 46:06.723
Who is this young man?

46:08.183 --> 46:10.435
Why'd you come so early?

46:10.686 --> 46:14.690
I wanted to wait for you
and make it a surprise.

46:14.857 --> 46:17.150
The party is spoiled.

46:18.151 --> 46:20.654
Some reunion this is!

46:22.281 --> 46:24.741
It's a swell reunion, Grandpa.

46:25.033 --> 46:27.327
Pops! I'm Pops.

46:27.870 --> 46:29.246
You forgot.

46:31.915 --> 46:33.542
How'd you find me?

46:33.709 --> 46:37.421
That tree was a secret
between me and your father.

46:37.588 --> 46:40.007
Yesterday I got a message from Dad.

46:40.883 --> 46:43.719
If he's alive, Mom must be, too.

46:44.511 --> 46:46.513
And that's not all. In here...

46:46.680 --> 46:49.057
The formula from 10 years ago.

46:49.224 --> 46:50.517
It cured Darwin!

46:51.310 --> 46:54.187
You succeeded! It's the Ultimate Serum!

46:54.980 --> 46:56.023
Can you explain?

46:56.189 --> 46:58.317
Not a good time.

46:58.734 --> 47:00.986
Paul and Annette, alive?

47:02.070 --> 47:03.488
Impossible!

47:14.249 --> 47:16.460
Were you better at convincing him?

47:16.627 --> 47:19.922
Paul won't talk. You won't hurt him, will you?

47:20.422 --> 47:22.007
You know we won't.

47:23.258 --> 47:26.595
Darwin swallowed the serum in the ball.

47:26.762 --> 47:30.432
After his recovery,
Paul transmitted a message to you

47:30.599 --> 47:33.727
via a rat fitted with unknown technology.

47:33.894 --> 47:37.064
Then, the black cloud and lightning,

47:37.230 --> 47:38.982
and your lab, kaput!

47:40.150 --> 47:43.362
Who's behind all this, and why?

47:43.528 --> 47:45.238
Maybe to get this?

47:45.572 --> 47:46.573
The serum.

47:46.990 --> 47:48.825
What's this? What's it do?

47:48.992 --> 47:51.370
It's a prototype, never used.

47:51.536 --> 47:54.039
Get your paws off it!

47:54.206 --> 47:58.085
So... Let's assume your aggressors

47:58.168 --> 48:00.253
are trying to procure the serum.

48:00.337 --> 48:03.674
But that won't help us find your parents.

48:04.633 --> 48:06.927
We have no leads, no clues...

48:07.094 --> 48:08.637
Yes, we do. The rat.

48:09.179 --> 48:14.101
You're right!
If I examine him, I'll surely unearth a clue.

48:14.267 --> 48:16.269
- I'm going to the statue.
- Me, too.

48:17.396 --> 48:18.981
Is that a good idea?

48:19.147 --> 48:20.816
He's right, it's too dangerous.

48:21.024 --> 48:23.860
I lost you once, that's enough.

48:24.027 --> 48:27.239
Stay here, it's safe. I've seen to that.

48:27.823 --> 48:29.074
Don't worry about me.

48:29.408 --> 48:33.245
In 10 years,
I've become an expert at blending in.

48:33.328 --> 48:34.329
Pops?

48:34.413 --> 48:36.832
- Yes?
- You have chalk on your nose.

48:39.334 --> 48:41.920
One last thing, don't touch the serum.

48:42.087 --> 48:44.589
We must examine it, test it.

48:46.675 --> 48:50.178
You'll find a change of clothing upstairs.

48:56.768 --> 48:59.521
Pizoni! You're wanted on the iteraphone!

48:59.855 --> 49:00.856
Pizoni!

49:04.526 --> 49:05.736
About time.

49:08.613 --> 49:11.324
Pizoni, Imperial Police. Yes?

49:11.825 --> 49:14.411
It's me. I found the old guy, Pops.

49:14.578 --> 49:16.329
I know where to nab him.

49:16.872 --> 49:18.373
<i>But you must keep your word.</i>

49:18.540 --> 49:21.251
Not until he's in handcuffs. And the girl?

49:23.211 --> 49:26.798
Gone. Don't ask me where, I have no idea.

49:48.320 --> 49:49.404
Julius?

49:52.949 --> 49:54.618
Julius...

49:55.035 --> 49:56.495
What do you think?

49:58.538 --> 49:59.664
Julius?

50:01.750 --> 50:02.918
Julius?

50:35.492 --> 50:37.786
A signal! Electromagnetic activity!

50:37.869 --> 50:39.830
Another one discovered electricity.

50:39.996 --> 50:42.249
Send a rat-spy to scout it out.

50:49.297 --> 50:51.133
Don't just stand there!

50:51.299 --> 50:53.969
Help me! Do something!

51:07.107 --> 51:08.775
What's with you? You okay?

51:21.538 --> 51:24.291
Don't make a sound, freeze. Turn around.

51:25.292 --> 51:28.920
Make up your mind.
Do I turn around or do I freeze?

51:29.379 --> 51:32.674
Always the wise guy, Pops. Turn around.

51:36.011 --> 51:37.053
Souvenir!

51:37.762 --> 51:39.347
Bring back memories?

51:56.531 --> 51:59.951
Prosper Franklin! Better late than never.

52:00.660 --> 52:02.537
Now you can fix my career.

52:03.622 --> 52:05.123
Right away!

52:05.540 --> 52:06.708
Arrest him.

52:07.375 --> 52:09.169
What? Seriously?

52:09.336 --> 52:10.629
Stop it!

52:10.795 --> 52:12.839
Thanks for the capture, Pizoni.

52:13.048 --> 52:15.300
But orders are orders, even 10 years on.

52:15.717 --> 52:18.220
You were forbidden to approach scientists.

52:18.386 --> 52:20.722
You could've caused another disaster

52:21.223 --> 52:22.432
with your talents.

52:22.599 --> 52:24.351
- Pops!
- Darwin!

52:24.559 --> 52:27.229
Warn April. In case of danger, use the globe!

52:27.395 --> 52:30.398
Uruguay! With a U, like urgency!

52:30.565 --> 52:31.733
You swine!

52:32.484 --> 52:35.028
- Come on! Off we go!
- This is an outrage!

52:35.487 --> 52:36.488
To Fort La Latte!

52:36.571 --> 52:37.739
Let me go!

52:37.948 --> 52:40.075
Let me go! Let me go!

52:43.203 --> 52:44.871
You won't tell me where you were?

52:45.163 --> 52:48.458
Outside. I needed to think.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.294
- I have to tell you something.
- I'm listening.

52:52.504 --> 52:53.797
The thing is...

52:54.339 --> 52:55.507
I can't stay.

53:00.053 --> 53:01.680
We found her, at last.

53:01.846 --> 53:03.265
How'd you locate her?

53:03.390 --> 53:04.599
An electric signal.

53:04.766 --> 53:07.435
This time we'll get the serum.

53:09.437 --> 53:10.563
So you're leaving?

53:10.939 --> 53:12.357
In the middle of the night?

53:12.649 --> 53:14.901
You could've told Pops goodbye.

53:15.944 --> 53:18.780
Sorry, but it's really for the best.

53:19.489 --> 53:21.783
Darwin will be so sad.

53:22.117 --> 53:24.077
I think he liked you.

53:25.370 --> 53:26.371
Darwin?

53:26.788 --> 53:28.039
Darwin!

53:28.123 --> 53:30.792
April, April! Pops has been arrested!

53:31.334 --> 53:32.711
What? How?

53:32.877 --> 53:34.337
Where'd they take him?

53:34.504 --> 53:37.340
To Fort La Latte. Wherever that is!

53:53.189 --> 53:56.109
Gentlemen, the Fort La Latte staff
welcomes you

53:56.276 --> 53:58.778
to the Empire's most secure secret base.

53:58.945 --> 54:01.990
A place immune to your disasters, Pizoni.

54:02.490 --> 54:05.452
A charming 14th century chamber
awaits you!

54:06.119 --> 54:07.329
Prosper Franklin,

54:07.495 --> 54:11.291
your brain cells
will be working for the Empire now.

54:12.000 --> 54:14.586
Try to help us win the war. That'll be all.

54:20.633 --> 54:23.720
My good man, what exactly is this place?

54:23.845 --> 54:27.682
A research lab.
People like you try to make new weapons.

54:27.849 --> 54:29.517
They pulled a wreck from the sea.

54:30.185 --> 54:31.853
We don't know what it is.

54:32.687 --> 54:34.773
This is our 19th attempt.

54:34.939 --> 54:37.067
I have a bad feeling.

54:37.233 --> 54:38.568
Here we go.

54:46.117 --> 54:47.702
Let's get lunch.

54:51.623 --> 54:55.001
What an absolute marvel!

54:55.585 --> 54:58.671
We don't know
where it's from or who made it.

54:58.838 --> 55:02.133
If you have any ideas we missed, get to work.

55:12.977 --> 55:14.938
"Fort La Latte, Brittany.

55:15.480 --> 55:19.734
"A deserted medieval fort on a cliff."

55:19.901 --> 55:22.570
How do we get there? By paw?

55:22.737 --> 55:24.197
Julius, any idea?

56:09.117 --> 56:11.661
- What're you doing?
- Geography does come in handy!

56:34.267 --> 56:38.688
<i>Dear visitor, if you can hear me,
you're in dire straits!</i>

56:38.855 --> 56:41.107
<i>Welcome to my Meta-Mansion!</i>

56:41.274 --> 56:44.903
<i>To steer the Meta-Mansion
to the location of your choice,</i>

56:44.986 --> 56:47.197
<i>type your destination on the keyboard.</i>

56:47.280 --> 56:51.326
<i>For all other information,
refer to the user's manual.</i>

57:30.031 --> 57:32.951
What is this place? Where are we going?

57:33.117 --> 57:34.452
To find Pops.

57:44.170 --> 57:45.880
Where are we?

57:58.393 --> 57:59.435
The bottom of the Seine.

58:25.461 --> 58:27.255
<i>April could've been hurt.</i>

58:27.422 --> 58:29.507
<i>Change your methods.</i>

58:29.674 --> 58:32.302
My dear, if you know a peaceful way

58:32.468 --> 58:35.597
to wipe out that shack on legs, wonderful.

58:35.763 --> 58:38.600
Meanwhile let me fly. Thank you.

58:48.526 --> 58:50.612
This is Normandy?

58:51.904 --> 58:55.074
No wonder we're stuck
eating fish and mushrooms.

58:55.950 --> 58:57.702
The countryside's gone.

58:58.620 --> 59:01.205
- This trip's got me down!
- Be patient.

59:01.539 --> 59:03.374
Just a few more hours.

59:03.958 --> 59:06.002
- Julius?
- Yeah?

59:06.544 --> 59:11.132
I know you didn't have a choice,
but thanks for helping me find Pops.

59:12.091 --> 59:14.218
At your service.

59:14.385 --> 59:16.429
You're in love!

59:16.721 --> 59:18.556
Don't you have cat stuff to do?

59:18.890 --> 59:20.767
Lick your butt or eat a rat?

59:21.434 --> 59:23.936
You're in love!

59:24.479 --> 59:26.397
Give that cat a shot!

59:26.564 --> 59:28.483
His brains are boiling over!

59:28.650 --> 59:31.736
No time. I'm kind of preparing an attack.

59:54.342 --> 59:58.137
My dear colleagues,
your method is totally wrong.

59:58.304 --> 1:00:02.100
The energy generated by this machine
clearly flows here.

1:00:02.266 --> 1:00:06.104
So the cables should be plugged in
here and here.

1:00:06.270 --> 1:00:08.022
We've wondered for years.

1:00:08.481 --> 1:00:10.108
What's the energy?

1:00:10.274 --> 1:00:14.445
A phenomenon long known,
but never mastered.

1:00:15.029 --> 1:00:17.281
Electricity!

1:00:17.699 --> 1:00:19.701
Magnetism, or lightning...

1:00:19.867 --> 1:00:21.703
Tremendous!

1:00:22.537 --> 1:00:24.330
This machine is a masterpiece.

1:00:24.497 --> 1:00:26.374
A bouquet of cables!

1:00:27.542 --> 1:00:30.044
What's going on? The doors! Quick!

1:00:30.211 --> 1:00:31.546
Alert! Alert!

1:00:31.629 --> 1:00:32.672
Evacuate!

1:00:34.090 --> 1:00:35.341
Everyone out!

1:00:35.508 --> 1:00:37.510
Run! To the stairs!

1:00:54.152 --> 1:00:55.486
Ready?

1:00:55.820 --> 1:00:57.155
Here we go.

1:01:09.834 --> 1:01:12.754
Help! Open up! Open up!

1:01:19.177 --> 1:01:22.305
This down here, this up there...

1:01:24.807 --> 1:01:25.892
Pops!

1:01:27.769 --> 1:01:28.936
Pops!

1:01:29.395 --> 1:01:30.646
Dang!

1:01:31.522 --> 1:01:32.815
Where's the blasted exit?

1:01:32.982 --> 1:01:34.984
No idea. Keep going!

1:01:49.123 --> 1:01:50.124
Pops!

1:02:01.969 --> 1:02:02.970
Pops?

1:02:04.639 --> 1:02:05.723
Pops?

1:02:05.807 --> 1:02:06.808
April?

1:02:17.735 --> 1:02:20.029
You shouldn't have, it's too dangerous.

1:02:20.196 --> 1:02:24.367
Excuse me, but we're kind of
surrounded in a sinking castle.

1:02:24.534 --> 1:02:26.327
Just give me a minute.

1:02:26.494 --> 1:02:29.205
I'm about to get this marvel working.

1:02:29.372 --> 1:02:30.790
Got a screw loose? Come on!

1:02:31.165 --> 1:02:32.667
To your motor shack!

1:02:39.465 --> 1:02:40.883
- My house!
- Sorry.

1:02:41.050 --> 1:02:42.802
We have to find another way out.

1:02:43.594 --> 1:02:45.388
Hands up! Next time we won't miss!

1:02:46.013 --> 1:02:47.014
Get in!

1:02:52.645 --> 1:02:53.688
Hang on!

1:03:02.363 --> 1:03:04.866
- There's a door...
- I'm on it, young man!

1:03:23.634 --> 1:03:26.846
It's calm now. Maybe we should land?

1:03:27.179 --> 1:03:29.515
We need to know our position first.

1:03:30.224 --> 1:03:32.977
We're flying at night with no visibility,

1:03:33.144 --> 1:03:35.855
and the guidance system doesn't work.

1:03:36.439 --> 1:03:40.735
So... We're lost
at sea in a busted contraption?

1:03:40.902 --> 1:03:42.278
There's no danger.

1:03:42.445 --> 1:03:44.405
Automatic pilot.

1:03:47.700 --> 1:03:51.579
It works.
I must say, I'm doing a pretty good job.

1:03:51.746 --> 1:03:54.498
- If you're so good, where are we?
- No idea.

1:03:54.665 --> 1:03:57.418
Could be the North Pole,
could be Madagascar.

1:03:57.501 --> 1:04:01.589
We'll know
once I repair the locating machine.

1:04:02.131 --> 1:04:03.174
But first,

1:04:03.257 --> 1:04:07.929
I'd like some explanations
from you, young man.

1:04:08.262 --> 1:04:11.349
Pizoni, the officer who handled my arrest,

1:04:11.515 --> 1:04:13.434
had two bits of information

1:04:14.268 --> 1:04:16.520
he wasn't supposed to have.

1:04:16.854 --> 1:04:20.399
One, my family nickname... Pops!

1:04:20.566 --> 1:04:23.527
Two, the place I was going,

1:04:23.611 --> 1:04:25.738
the statue of Napoleon.

1:04:26.364 --> 1:04:30.868
I see no reason why April, Darwin or myself

1:04:31.035 --> 1:04:32.578
would've turned me in.

1:04:33.245 --> 1:04:36.624
Julius, why did you do that?

1:04:37.875 --> 1:04:40.294
You lied to me? The whole time?

1:04:40.461 --> 1:04:43.589
You used me, just to give Pops to the cops!

1:04:43.714 --> 1:04:46.092
I had no choice. It was that or jail!

1:04:46.258 --> 1:04:47.677
But I came back. For you!

1:04:47.843 --> 1:04:49.053
Just to say goodbye.

1:04:49.136 --> 1:04:51.180
I wish you hadn't. Don't touch me!

1:04:51.389 --> 1:04:53.140
And don't talk to me.

1:05:10.032 --> 1:05:12.994
Pizoni told me
Pops would work for the Empire

1:05:13.160 --> 1:05:14.495
and be well-treated.

1:05:14.662 --> 1:05:16.706
I figured it was okay.

1:05:17.915 --> 1:05:20.334
But all that was before...

1:05:21.002 --> 1:05:23.004
Before you fell in love.

1:05:23.170 --> 1:05:25.256
You were just dumb at the wrong time.

1:05:27.049 --> 1:05:28.384
Thanks.

1:05:28.843 --> 1:05:29.844
Okay...

1:05:30.011 --> 1:05:31.804
Now it's going to work.

1:05:36.142 --> 1:05:37.685
Now what? Come on!

1:05:38.519 --> 1:05:41.188
<i>Dear scientist, welcome aboard.</i>

1:05:43.149 --> 1:05:45.693
<i>We're Rodrigue and ChimÃ¨ne,
your new masters.</i>

1:05:45.860 --> 1:05:48.696
<i>In nice surroundings
far from your government's stupidity,</i>

1:05:48.863 --> 1:05:50.614
<i>your talents are at our service.</i>

1:05:50.906 --> 1:05:52.324
<i>All science is useful.</i>

1:05:52.491 --> 1:05:56.162
<i>Like your cruel species, we have learned
that power is knowledge.</i>

1:05:56.328 --> 1:05:57.413
<i>With your expertise,</i>

1:05:57.580 --> 1:06:00.666
<i>our technological superiority
will forever prevail.</i>

1:06:00.833 --> 1:06:03.878
<i>We will explain our aim at a later stage.</i>

1:06:04.045 --> 1:06:08.049
<i>If you have an illness or defect,
please report it.</i>

1:06:08.132 --> 1:06:10.718
<i>Your diet will be strictly vegetarian.</i>

1:06:10.885 --> 1:06:14.096
<i>In case of airsickness,
please use the sick bags.</i>

1:06:14.263 --> 1:06:16.390
<i>We wish you a pleasant trip.</i>

1:06:25.816 --> 1:06:27.068
<i>Lizards?</i>

1:06:28.819 --> 1:06:31.322
<i>Lizards kidnapped Mom and Dad?</i>

1:06:31.739 --> 1:06:35.868
<i>I believe, in actual fact, they're dragons.</i>

1:06:36.786 --> 1:06:38.204
Where are they?

1:06:38.746 --> 1:06:40.247
On Airocopter 13.

1:06:40.414 --> 1:06:43.250
We can locate and hear them,
but not see them.

1:06:43.417 --> 1:06:45.628
Airocopter 13 was lost in a storm.

1:06:45.795 --> 1:06:47.129
How'd they get it?

1:06:47.296 --> 1:06:50.257
Doesn't matter, we located April.

1:06:50.424 --> 1:06:53.260
Prepare for takeoff!
I'll bring that Airocopter back!

1:06:53.427 --> 1:06:55.429
No. We know the outcome of your methods.

1:06:55.596 --> 1:06:57.431
Rodrigue, let me handle this.

1:06:57.765 --> 1:06:59.934
Sorry I got carried away.

1:07:00.101 --> 1:07:03.104
If you know a way to bring April back safely,

1:07:03.270 --> 1:07:04.939
I'm at your service.

1:07:05.272 --> 1:07:09.276
ChimÃ¨ne, never criticize me
in front of the children!

1:07:14.532 --> 1:07:17.993
Reptiles who talk... Like Darwin.

1:07:18.160 --> 1:07:20.287
We'll figure that out later.

1:07:20.454 --> 1:07:22.832
First we need to know where we are.

1:07:22.998 --> 1:07:26.627
If I can get this pile of junk working!

1:07:27.336 --> 1:07:29.380
<i>Dear friends, thanks for coming.</i>

1:07:29.547 --> 1:07:33.634
<i>April, I can't wait to see you, and your serum.</i>

1:07:42.768 --> 1:07:44.687
They've taken over the Airocopter!

1:07:44.854 --> 1:07:46.856
The controls have stopped working!

1:08:27.021 --> 1:08:28.189
Where are you going?

1:08:28.355 --> 1:08:29.648
Down to the hold!

1:08:30.357 --> 1:08:34.028
The propulsion's out of order. I'll try to fix it.

1:08:41.619 --> 1:08:43.162
You're insane! Stop!

1:08:43.329 --> 1:08:45.372
Stay back, Gramps! I heard everything!

1:08:45.539 --> 1:08:48.042
No lizard's taking me prisoner!

1:08:48.209 --> 1:08:50.211
This contraption's going down!

1:08:51.086 --> 1:08:52.379
Right now!

1:09:25.079 --> 1:09:26.372
Music...

1:09:26.872 --> 1:09:31.043
One of the rare pleasures created by humans.

1:09:31.794 --> 1:09:33.295
So, Fleming?

1:09:33.462 --> 1:09:35.631
You're very tense. Too much stress.

1:09:35.798 --> 1:09:37.925
You need a vacation.

1:09:39.385 --> 1:09:42.346
<i>Rodrigue, we got control of the Airocopter.</i>

1:09:42.513 --> 1:09:45.432
Congratulations, my love. And?

1:09:45.599 --> 1:09:47.810
<i>We lost contact. It crashed on the base.</i>

1:09:47.977 --> 1:09:49.019
Remarkable!

1:09:49.186 --> 1:09:51.855
Our fugitives must love
the outcome of your methods.

1:09:52.022 --> 1:09:53.857
Letting them come alone was stupid!

1:09:54.024 --> 1:09:56.652
April could be in pieces now!

1:09:56.819 --> 1:09:58.237
<i>Don't be childish.</i>

1:09:58.404 --> 1:10:01.282
<i>To be useful, we must search the jungle.</i>

1:10:07.788 --> 1:10:09.123
Pops?

1:10:11.959 --> 1:10:12.960
Pops?

1:10:19.174 --> 1:10:20.175
Pops?

1:10:57.546 --> 1:10:59.006
Where are we?

1:11:12.811 --> 1:11:14.813
Come now, Pizoni, be brave!

1:11:14.980 --> 1:11:18.108
I did it, and I could be your father!

1:11:18.442 --> 1:11:19.735
I don't care, I'm not moving!

1:11:19.902 --> 1:11:23.113
Hurry up, I've got a granddaughter to find.

1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:25.199
Why don't these trees have stairs?

1:11:25.366 --> 1:11:30.704
Pizoni, close your eyes
and just slide down this lovely vine.

1:11:41.715 --> 1:11:44.802
So this is what those lizards want? But why?

1:11:44.968 --> 1:11:47.346
They're dragons.

1:11:48.555 --> 1:11:50.391
So beautiful, all these trees...

1:11:51.100 --> 1:11:52.518
All these plants...

1:11:54.311 --> 1:11:55.854
All this clean air...

1:11:59.400 --> 1:12:00.401
Do you hate me?

1:12:00.567 --> 1:12:01.985
What do you want me to do?

1:12:02.152 --> 1:12:04.196
Say we're meant for each other?

1:12:04.363 --> 1:12:05.948
Kiss and make up?

1:12:06.657 --> 1:12:07.699
Yeah!

1:12:07.783 --> 1:12:09.952
Julius, you're the love of my life!

1:12:10.119 --> 1:12:13.330
So what if you sold Pops to the cops
and lied to me!

1:12:13.497 --> 1:12:16.750
If they hadn't nabbed Pops
we wouldn't be here!

1:12:17.084 --> 1:12:19.920
Thanks to me you might find your parents!

1:12:20.087 --> 1:12:23.090
I went looking for them
and ended up with you.

1:12:23.257 --> 1:12:25.592
Is that it? Are you through?

1:12:25.759 --> 1:12:27.094
What do we do now?

1:12:27.261 --> 1:12:30.389
How do I know?
Go sniff ahead, see what you find.

1:12:30.556 --> 1:12:33.434
I gotta take all the risks? Brilliant!

1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:35.060
Go sniff ahead yourself.

1:12:35.227 --> 1:12:38.230
Darwin, don't be upset. Come back.

1:12:38.397 --> 1:12:41.650
I have a little private need to attend to.

1:12:47.239 --> 1:12:49.575
For a cop, I'm behind bars a lot.

1:12:54.913 --> 1:12:57.291
Incredible!

1:12:59.877 --> 1:13:02.296
Do you like your enclosure?

1:13:02.629 --> 1:13:04.715
It wasn't me! He wrecked your machine!

1:13:04.798 --> 1:13:06.550
Let me out, I'll work for you.

1:13:06.633 --> 1:13:08.635
Discipline is my middle name!

1:13:10.137 --> 1:13:11.638
Where's April?

1:13:12.097 --> 1:13:14.141
I wish I knew.

1:13:14.308 --> 1:13:15.309
Me, too.

1:13:15.559 --> 1:13:17.895
I'm sure you're lying.

1:13:19.980 --> 1:13:21.648
Rodrigue,

1:13:21.732 --> 1:13:23.942
stop playing the cruel male.

1:13:24.109 --> 1:13:25.652
They don't know.

1:13:25.903 --> 1:13:28.947
The children found part
of the Airocopter, and footprints.

1:13:29.031 --> 1:13:30.949
We must keep searching.

1:13:38.832 --> 1:13:41.084
See that? I nearly tricked him.

1:13:41.251 --> 1:13:43.378
He almost set us free.

1:13:43.545 --> 1:13:44.588
Dad?

1:13:48.675 --> 1:13:50.010
Paul?

1:13:56.350 --> 1:13:57.809
Smells <i>buonissimo!</i>

1:13:57.893 --> 1:13:59.061
Can I try it?

1:13:59.144 --> 1:14:01.647
If you like. It's cockroach pÃ¢tÃ©.

1:14:02.356 --> 1:14:05.609
<i>GraziÃ© mille, ma</i> I'd hate
to deprive you of your protein.

1:14:05.901 --> 1:14:07.402
Sure you don't want any?

1:14:07.694 --> 1:14:09.821
My friend, I have work to do.

1:14:09.988 --> 1:14:12.115
I thought those scientists were prisoners?

1:14:12.741 --> 1:14:16.036
I'm sick of Schumann.
Couldn't they play some Verdi?

1:14:41.562 --> 1:14:42.896
How's tricks?

1:14:43.397 --> 1:14:45.190
Tell me, dear colleague,

1:14:45.357 --> 1:14:48.026
have you seen Annette and Paul Franklin?

1:14:48.527 --> 1:14:50.529
<i>Scusi, ma...</i> Who are you?

1:14:53.323 --> 1:14:54.866
Where are the Franklins?

1:14:55.117 --> 1:14:57.160
You don't know who you are?

1:14:57.244 --> 1:15:01.039
Why are you looking for Mr. Franklin?
That traitor! Who are you?

1:15:01.206 --> 1:15:03.917
Security! We've got spies!

1:15:06.837 --> 1:15:08.088
No, not here!

1:15:25.939 --> 1:15:27.608
I forgot to save my file!

1:15:27.774 --> 1:15:29.568
Activate the emergency generators.

1:15:29.735 --> 1:15:30.902
It takes time.

1:15:31.069 --> 1:15:32.904
Go check the power plant.

1:15:34.406 --> 1:15:36.366
Night falls fast around here.

1:15:38.994 --> 1:15:40.829
- Dad?
- Paul!

1:15:43.457 --> 1:15:44.666
Now what do we do?

1:15:44.833 --> 1:15:46.293
We must find April!

1:15:46.460 --> 1:15:47.544
Where's Annette?

1:15:47.711 --> 1:15:49.338
Don't worry about her.

1:15:57.638 --> 1:15:59.514
Hey, tadpole! Here, boy!

1:15:59.681 --> 1:16:01.016
Heel!

1:16:26.667 --> 1:16:29.378
No, mercy! I'm afraid of heights!

1:16:31.004 --> 1:16:32.839
Where are the Franklins?

1:16:33.006 --> 1:16:35.717
The female, I don't know.
The male is locked up!

1:16:35.884 --> 1:16:37.678
Dad, imprisoned? Where?

1:16:37.761 --> 1:16:40.597
The cellular zone. Follow the blue lights.

1:16:42.557 --> 1:16:45.185
I've had it with these dang vines!

1:16:45.686 --> 1:16:46.728
Where are we going?

1:16:46.812 --> 1:16:49.523
To find my daughter.
I think I know where she is.

1:16:50.273 --> 1:16:51.858
I'm over your family.

1:16:52.025 --> 1:16:53.527
I just want out of here.

1:16:53.694 --> 1:16:55.696
Where's the blasted exit?

1:16:56.279 --> 1:16:58.490
Bloody vegetation!

1:16:59.574 --> 1:17:02.703
We should survive without his abilities.

1:17:03.537 --> 1:17:04.579
Right.

1:17:04.663 --> 1:17:06.915
The surveillance system is disabled.

1:17:07.290 --> 1:17:09.251
You can go out the chimney.

1:17:09.418 --> 1:17:10.877
The chimney?

1:17:13.547 --> 1:17:15.465
<i>Dad? 521 here.</i>

1:17:15.632 --> 1:17:18.051
<i>I'll pass you 238. We just found him.</i>

1:17:18.218 --> 1:17:20.887
What happened, 238?
Was it April and her gang?

1:17:21.555 --> 1:17:23.557
Yes. They're headed for the cells.

1:17:23.724 --> 1:17:25.726
Looking for Paul Franklin.

1:17:26.893 --> 1:17:29.604
They got my ray lance. Sorry, Dad.

1:17:30.814 --> 1:17:32.149
They're here.

1:17:32.482 --> 1:17:34.735
We've got them. Capture is near...

1:17:34.901 --> 1:17:36.069
But delicate.

1:17:36.236 --> 1:17:38.488
We must avoid a shootout.

1:17:38.655 --> 1:17:41.324
ChimÃ¨ne, I just got an idea.

1:17:41.491 --> 1:17:42.784
A pacifist idea.

1:17:42.951 --> 1:17:44.619
It will be to your liking.

1:17:45.787 --> 1:17:46.955
Paul!

1:17:47.038 --> 1:17:49.916
Paul, slow down. I'm not 60 anymore.

1:17:53.754 --> 1:17:55.922
Where are we going?

1:17:58.008 --> 1:18:01.428
April doesn't know this jungle.
She's surely been captured.

1:18:01.762 --> 1:18:04.055
I know where they'll take her.

1:18:05.557 --> 1:18:07.434
What's she look like now?

1:18:09.770 --> 1:18:11.438
Follow the blue lights!

1:18:11.605 --> 1:18:12.856
Piece of cake.

1:18:13.023 --> 1:18:15.108
Too easy for this one!

1:18:15.275 --> 1:18:18.612
This one wanted to blend into the scenery
like an animal!

1:18:18.779 --> 1:18:21.031
This one didn't want to be seen!

1:18:21.281 --> 1:18:23.283
So this one got us lost!

1:18:23.450 --> 1:18:25.160
Fight quietly, please.

1:18:25.327 --> 1:18:27.245
You can be heard for miles.

1:19:02.739 --> 1:19:03.990
Mom?

1:19:05.075 --> 1:19:06.409
April!

1:19:07.077 --> 1:19:08.328
Mom!

1:19:18.004 --> 1:19:21.216
Mom, look! It's Darwin.

1:19:21.383 --> 1:19:23.802
And that's... Julius.

1:19:23.969 --> 1:19:27.556
We'll get acquainted later. We can't stay here.

1:19:33.728 --> 1:19:35.355
So, you escaped?

1:19:35.522 --> 1:19:38.149
Were you in prison, like Dad?

1:19:39.484 --> 1:19:41.069
Know how to get him out?

1:19:41.236 --> 1:19:43.029
I'll explain everything.

1:19:46.783 --> 1:19:48.034
Beautiful, isn't it?

1:19:48.201 --> 1:19:50.328
A technological paradise.

1:19:50.495 --> 1:19:52.706
A paradise with prisoners.

1:19:53.206 --> 1:19:54.207
Where's Dad?

1:19:54.457 --> 1:19:58.128
Here, the world's smartest people
work with animals.

1:19:58.295 --> 1:20:02.799
Dragons and scientists,
working together for the Project.

1:20:03.466 --> 1:20:05.552
What do you mean? What project?

1:20:05.719 --> 1:20:07.804
Anything to do with the serum?

1:20:08.263 --> 1:20:10.390
Why aren't you in prison like Dad?

1:20:10.557 --> 1:20:11.641
Hang on.

1:20:49.721 --> 1:20:52.515
Welcome, little female!

1:20:59.105 --> 1:21:01.900
You lied to me. You betrayed us!

1:21:02.067 --> 1:21:03.652
I did neither.

1:21:03.985 --> 1:21:06.571
You're here for the greatest cause.

1:21:06.738 --> 1:21:08.239
Excellent work, thanks.

1:21:11.785 --> 1:21:13.954
The Franklins' little runt.

1:21:14.120 --> 1:21:18.249
What a pleasure,
knowing this family for so long... Not!

1:21:18.667 --> 1:21:20.961
Here's your serum. That's what you want.

1:21:21.127 --> 1:21:23.672
It's yours!
Give me back my dad and let us go.

1:21:33.014 --> 1:21:37.310
Idiot! We don't want that stupid ball,
we want your mind!

1:21:37.560 --> 1:21:41.398
We want the formula
you worked so hard to find.

1:21:41.481 --> 1:21:42.857
It saved your cat.

1:21:43.024 --> 1:21:44.943
The real Ultimate Serum.

1:21:45.110 --> 1:21:46.569
What are you on about?

1:21:46.653 --> 1:21:49.823
My cat was saved by my parents' serum,
in the ball.

1:21:49.906 --> 1:21:51.449
My formula never worked.

1:21:51.616 --> 1:21:55.286
April, the serum we left you
10 years ago was ineffective.

1:21:55.453 --> 1:21:58.748
We recreated it here, and it failed.

1:22:01.084 --> 1:22:02.460
329!

1:22:04.546 --> 1:22:06.715
I'm 156, Mom!

1:22:08.133 --> 1:22:12.095
This is Spy 217.
We sent him to your laboratory.

1:22:12.178 --> 1:22:16.683
Two drops of your serum revived him
after he met your cat.

1:22:38.663 --> 1:22:40.790
Like Darwin, the rodent mutated.

1:22:40.957 --> 1:22:44.002
He can regenerate, survive any attack.

1:22:44.169 --> 1:22:46.296
Hear that? I'm a cat-warrior!

1:22:46.463 --> 1:22:48.298
I'm kittenvincible!

1:22:48.882 --> 1:22:51.718
How could I have done that
in my crummy lab?

1:22:57.599 --> 1:22:59.059
Murderer!

1:23:00.268 --> 1:23:01.561
Psychopath!

1:23:01.728 --> 1:23:05.065
Shut up! And watch...

1:23:14.032 --> 1:23:16.701
Kittenvincible!

1:23:18.036 --> 1:23:19.913
That really wasn't necessary.

1:23:20.080 --> 1:23:25.168
You will recreate the Ultimate Serum
here, for the Project.

1:23:25.418 --> 1:23:26.836
The Project?

1:23:26.920 --> 1:23:30.673
<i>The emergency generators are working!
Activate!</i>

1:24:05.458 --> 1:24:09.129
This is a rocket.
It'll explode way out in space.

1:24:09.546 --> 1:24:11.422
Scattering the leaves and vines,

1:24:11.923 --> 1:24:14.884
spreading billions of spores from our jungle.

1:24:15.218 --> 1:24:17.262
These organisms, treated with your formula,

1:24:17.428 --> 1:24:20.306
will survive the explosion
and interstellar space.

1:24:20.807 --> 1:24:23.393
They'll live and multiply on new planets.

1:24:23.560 --> 1:24:26.813
April, thanks to your discovery,
life will never die!

1:24:26.938 --> 1:24:29.816
The rocket vegetation awaits your serum.

1:24:29.983 --> 1:24:32.694
"Project Second Life" is finally happening!

1:24:32.861 --> 1:24:33.862
Hang on...

1:24:34.320 --> 1:24:38.032
You're gonna blow up
a giant bomb to save life?

1:24:38.199 --> 1:24:40.118
All this science for that?

1:24:40.201 --> 1:24:41.286
April,

1:24:41.619 --> 1:24:46.666
your ancestor, Gustave, showed us
how you humans use science.

1:24:46.833 --> 1:24:49.586
You'll end up destroying everything.

1:24:49.752 --> 1:24:53.006
Using your science to preserve life
is our only hope.

1:24:53.381 --> 1:24:55.925
Far from humans, nature could survive.

1:24:56.092 --> 1:24:57.468
Some pacifists you are!

1:24:57.552 --> 1:25:01.097
You kidnapped my parents
and blew up a cable car, killing everyone!

1:25:01.181 --> 1:25:02.307
That was an accident.

1:25:02.473 --> 1:25:04.767
Nothing compared to your wars.

1:25:05.268 --> 1:25:08.479
If you refuse to help us, though it repels me,

1:25:08.646 --> 1:25:10.899
Rodrigue will have to deal with your mother.

1:25:12.108 --> 1:25:13.735
Sorry, Annette.

1:25:13.902 --> 1:25:16.029
But we have to save nature.

1:25:17.739 --> 1:25:19.490
Where's your lab?

1:25:38.718 --> 1:25:39.802
Need a hand?

1:25:39.969 --> 1:25:41.429
Pass me the catalyst.

1:25:41.554 --> 1:25:42.722
That liquid there.

1:25:45.850 --> 1:25:48.937
Should you give your serum
to those lizards?

1:25:49.103 --> 1:25:51.856
Julius, it's water.

1:26:17.090 --> 1:26:18.216
There, done.

1:26:18.383 --> 1:26:20.093
Let's test it.

1:26:20.385 --> 1:26:21.844
132!

1:26:26.266 --> 1:26:27.725
Hold it.

1:26:52.500 --> 1:26:55.503
The Ultimate Serum! You did it!

1:26:58.756 --> 1:27:00.008
The vial!

1:27:08.391 --> 1:27:09.392
You're welcome.

1:27:09.559 --> 1:27:10.560
Final phase!

1:27:10.727 --> 1:27:12.895
Injecting the serum into the rocket vines!

1:27:13.062 --> 1:27:14.439
Checking guidance.

1:27:14.605 --> 1:27:17.900
Firing the engines. Clearing the launch pad!

1:27:18.067 --> 1:27:20.570
Rodrigue, will you give me the serum?

1:27:21.446 --> 1:27:22.822
Rodrigue!

1:27:28.036 --> 1:27:30.413
The serum is for the rocket only!

1:27:31.998 --> 1:27:34.709
Korolev! Fire the engines! Blastoff time!

1:27:35.001 --> 1:27:36.669
The serum hasn't been injected!

1:27:36.836 --> 1:27:39.213
Verifications are not finished...

1:27:39.380 --> 1:27:43.343
I handled it. Prepare for blastoff
if you want to keep your legs.

1:27:50.433 --> 1:27:54.645
How great it feels to be invincible!

1:27:54.812 --> 1:27:58.024
ChimÃ¨ne! I adjusted the bomb's altimeter.

1:27:58.191 --> 1:28:00.985
The rocket will explode at 500 meters.

1:28:01.152 --> 1:28:03.279
All earthly life will be destroyed!

1:28:03.488 --> 1:28:06.574
<i>Firing the engines! Phase 1...</i>

1:28:13.122 --> 1:28:15.375
Humans will meet the fate they deserve.

1:28:15.541 --> 1:28:17.126
We'll dance on their ashes!

1:28:17.293 --> 1:28:20.213
We, the dragons,
will reign to the end of time,

1:28:20.380 --> 1:28:23.591
invincible, immune to sickness and death!

1:28:23.758 --> 1:28:25.760
ChimÃ¨ne, we will protect life,

1:28:25.927 --> 1:28:28.179
the lives of the deserving, our lives!

1:28:28.721 --> 1:28:30.515
Let's drink the serum!

1:28:30.681 --> 1:28:34.310
Never! I can't let you commit
such an abomination!

1:28:35.561 --> 1:28:36.979
ChimÃ¨ne...

1:28:37.146 --> 1:28:38.773
My ChimÃ¨ne...

1:28:38.940 --> 1:28:41.150
I can no longer bear your orders.

1:28:41.317 --> 1:28:44.654
I am appalled
at how you treat this human trash.

1:28:44.987 --> 1:28:48.741
We no longer see eye to eye.
It's time for us to part!

1:28:50.868 --> 1:28:52.703
And I'll take the children!

1:28:57.708 --> 1:29:00.044
Children! Make up your minds.

1:29:00.378 --> 1:29:02.797
Live and reign with Dad,

1:29:02.964 --> 1:29:04.966
or die with Mom?

1:29:07.677 --> 1:29:08.761
Leave her alone!

1:29:11.597 --> 1:29:12.682
Mom!

1:29:39.500 --> 1:29:40.751
Dad!

1:29:41.252 --> 1:29:42.420
Mom!

1:29:42.712 --> 1:29:43.713
Dad!

1:29:43.796 --> 1:29:46.048
<i>Firing the engines, phase 2...</i>

1:29:54.640 --> 1:29:56.476
The dragons have gone bananas!

1:29:56.642 --> 1:29:58.060
To the monorail, quick!

1:29:58.227 --> 1:30:00.438
Doctors first!

1:30:00.980 --> 1:30:02.356
Make room!

1:30:03.816 --> 1:30:04.859
Wait for me!

1:30:08.529 --> 1:30:10.239
Julius! Julius!

1:30:10.323 --> 1:30:11.324
Mom!

1:30:11.741 --> 1:30:13.618
The Project... Our lives...

1:30:13.784 --> 1:30:15.119
All a failure.

1:30:15.453 --> 1:30:18.498
April, if you only knew how sorry I am...

1:30:19.373 --> 1:30:23.044
We must find ChimÃ¨ne.
Only she can prevent the disaster.

1:30:23.377 --> 1:30:24.837
I can't leave you.

1:30:25.254 --> 1:30:27.173
Go. I'll manage.

1:30:43.564 --> 1:30:44.565
April.

1:30:45.191 --> 1:30:46.484
ChimÃ¨ne!

1:30:46.901 --> 1:30:50.530
Listen to me. We have one last chance.
The altimeter.

1:30:50.863 --> 1:30:53.449
Go in the rocket
and adjust the bomb's altimeter.

1:30:54.492 --> 1:30:56.494
So it'll explode in space.

1:31:00.331 --> 1:31:01.332
ChimÃ¨ne,

1:31:10.466 --> 1:31:11.968
April.

1:31:12.718 --> 1:31:15.221
Thanks again for everything.

1:31:22.562 --> 1:31:24.063
Yoo-hoo, lizard!

1:31:24.230 --> 1:31:26.566
Idiot! I'm invincible!

1:31:31.028 --> 1:31:33.864
That's right, tadpole! Here's the serum!

1:31:34.031 --> 1:31:35.491
I gave you water!

1:31:35.908 --> 1:31:40.162
Rodrigue, king of the universe,
you drank good old H2O!

1:31:57.388 --> 1:31:58.973
<i>Lift-off in three minutes.</i>

1:31:59.140 --> 1:32:01.309
<i>Evacuate the launch pad, please.</i>

1:32:01.475 --> 1:32:02.476
Come on!

1:32:02.643 --> 1:32:03.936
To the rocket!

1:32:04.103 --> 1:32:06.564
The rocket? Are you crazy?

1:32:06.731 --> 1:32:07.732
April, wait! Hey!

1:32:19.118 --> 1:32:21.370
<i>Lift-off in two minutes.</i>

1:32:22.121 --> 1:32:24.999
<i>Attention, doors sealing.</i>

1:32:35.968 --> 1:32:37.970
Darwin! Darwin!

1:32:38.929 --> 1:32:39.972
Too late!

1:32:54.487 --> 1:32:57.823
<i>Firing the engines, phase 3.</i>

1:33:06.499 --> 1:33:07.708
April!

1:33:07.875 --> 1:33:08.876
Dad!

1:33:11.045 --> 1:33:12.129
Come on, hurry!

1:33:22.848 --> 1:33:24.350
April, what're you doing?

1:34:45.139 --> 1:34:46.182
What?

1:35:14.960 --> 1:35:18.297
- Where are we?
- No time to explain. Go!

1:35:49.995 --> 1:35:51.705
Keep going!

1:35:52.456 --> 1:35:53.499
This way!

1:35:56.544 --> 1:35:58.546
Hurry, as far away as possible!

1:35:58.629 --> 1:36:00.422
TOILET
IMPERIAL

1:36:08.514 --> 1:36:09.765
Get in!

1:36:21.277 --> 1:36:22.778
The bomb's going to explode!

1:36:22.945 --> 1:36:26.907
We have to try to get as far away as possible!

1:36:27.074 --> 1:36:28.617
Unless Darwin succeeds!

1:36:28.784 --> 1:36:30.244
What do you mean?

1:36:40.588 --> 1:36:43.340
What have we done? Science will know sin.

1:36:43.507 --> 1:36:44.884
Big time!

1:36:46.552 --> 1:36:48.637
Lousy rotten chimney!

1:37:20.753 --> 1:37:23.255
<i>September 16, 1941.</i>

1:37:23.422 --> 1:37:27.259
<i>To thank him
for his invaluable services to the Empire,</i>

1:37:27.426 --> 1:37:31.847
