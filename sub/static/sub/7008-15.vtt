WEBVTT

00:03.601 --> 00:06.469
Welcome to a very magical <i>Tool Time.</i>

00:11.742 --> 00:13.973
That was just a cheesy video effect.

00:14.045 --> 00:16.004
On today's show,
we're gonna have some real magic.

00:16.047 --> 00:18.312
That's right.
Heidi is going to introduce us

00:18.382 --> 00:21.443
to two of the world's biggest
prestidigitators.

00:24.522 --> 00:26.616
Not on this show you're not.

00:28.593 --> 00:29.754
No, no.

00:30.228 --> 00:32.561
A prestidigitator is a magician.

00:35.800 --> 00:37.632
Well, in that case, you're wondering

00:37.735 --> 00:39.897
why would you have a magician
on this show?

00:39.971 --> 00:41.208
That's because I think magic is cool.

00:41.238 --> 00:42.604
In order to spice <i>Tool Time</i> up,

00:42.707 --> 00:44.869
we're gonna turn <i>Tool Time</i>
into <i>Cool Time.</i>

00:44.976 --> 00:47.946
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Penn & Teller!

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:59.690 --> 01:00.690
Thank you.

01:01.726 --> 01:03.160
- Oh, wow!
- This is great.

01:03.227 --> 01:05.498
- Great to have you on the show.
- Oh, it's great to be here.

01:05.529 --> 01:07.329
I'm such a...
I'm such a big fan of <i>Tool Time.</i>

01:07.365 --> 01:08.594
Teller, how about you?

01:08.666 --> 01:10.225
He doesn't talk.

01:10.601 --> 01:12.832
An assistant who doesn't talk.

01:14.538 --> 01:16.700
I'd like to switch.
I've got 20 bucks right here...

01:16.807 --> 01:18.708
Where's my wallet?

01:21.112 --> 01:22.944
Oh, that's great!

01:23.214 --> 01:24.477
He's very good. He's...

01:24.548 --> 01:26.915
That's the really tough one.

01:29.387 --> 01:31.356
They are very good, huh?

01:31.822 --> 01:33.848
So, what other tricks
are you gonna show us today?

01:33.924 --> 01:36.587
We're gonna show you
the Houdini box escape!

01:36.661 --> 01:38.152
Houdini box escape!

01:38.229 --> 01:40.562
We have a perfectly ordinary box here.
Solid plywood.

01:40.631 --> 01:41.711
Need someone to examine it,

01:41.766 --> 01:44.861
make sure there are no trapdoors
or secret panels or anything.

01:44.935 --> 01:47.097
- Anybody?
- Tim, why don't you examine it here?

01:47.171 --> 01:49.902
You're the expert on structural integrity.
Check it out here.

01:49.974 --> 01:51.612
Check it out. Check it out on the inside.

01:51.642 --> 01:54.322
Be sure to check the bottom there.
Make sure there are no trapdoors.

01:54.378 --> 01:55.378
No trapdoor.

01:55.446 --> 01:57.485
You want to make sure
there's no catch there or anything.

01:57.515 --> 01:59.677
- All right.
- Just check it out there. There we go!

01:59.750 --> 02:00.774
Hey!

02:01.152 --> 02:02.176
There we go.

02:03.254 --> 02:05.120
Watch your fingers.
Watch your fingers.

02:06.223 --> 02:07.589
There we go.

02:08.925 --> 02:11.293
- How are you doing in there, Tim?
- I'm in a box!

02:11.395 --> 02:12.693
All right!

02:13.597 --> 02:15.532
Okay. So, what happens now?

02:15.599 --> 02:20.333
Well, if he were Houdini,
he'd be escaping in about 38 seconds.

02:20.404 --> 02:23.067
But since it's Tim, it's gonna be awhile.

02:23.140 --> 02:25.075
- Get comfortable.
- What?

02:25.843 --> 02:27.471
Excellent trick!

02:27.878 --> 02:29.039
Shut up, Al.

02:32.316 --> 02:35.684
So, what do you want to do?
It's Al's <i>Tool Time</i> now.

02:38.155 --> 02:40.056
All right. Well, can we saw this in half?

02:40.124 --> 02:42.616
How about we saw Teller in half?
He's coming right over here.

02:42.693 --> 02:44.131
Hey, let me out of here!
It's my show!

02:44.161 --> 02:45.925
Yeah. Was your show. Hurry up.

02:46.597 --> 02:48.327
Look at this.
So, you can saw him in half.

02:48.399 --> 02:50.129
What would you like to use?
What tool?

02:50.201 --> 02:53.501
Well, why don't we use
the Binford 6100 power handsaw?

02:53.571 --> 02:55.631
That's too much saw for Al!

02:57.775 --> 02:59.403
Save your oxygen.

03:00.044 --> 03:02.411
This works most of the time.
Go ahead, give it a shot.

03:02.813 --> 03:04.338
You'll be okay.

03:05.716 --> 03:07.685
There you go. Beautiful.

03:07.952 --> 03:10.615
Oh, nicely done. Nicely done.
Beautifully done.

03:11.622 --> 03:14.592
Beautiful. Now, let's just prove
you went all the way through.

03:15.459 --> 03:16.825
There it is!

03:19.397 --> 03:20.922
I did it! All right!

03:21.499 --> 03:22.990
Now, are you okay?

03:23.801 --> 03:25.429
- He's fine. He's fine.
- Yeah!

03:26.370 --> 03:29.033
- You want to see how it's done?
- I'd like to see how it's done.

03:29.106 --> 03:31.837
Okay. Just... Well, we're not murderers.

03:31.909 --> 03:35.607
So, we just have Teller squished up
in the top half of the box.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.340
Tim, you got to see this!

03:38.883 --> 03:40.408
That was so great.

03:40.484 --> 03:42.851
Then you just find
some flunky backstage

03:42.953 --> 03:45.889
and use him to play the part of the feet.

03:45.956 --> 03:48.084
There he is! Escapo!

03:48.893 --> 03:50.521
Very nicely done, Tim.

03:51.195 --> 03:53.061
Ladies and gentlemen, Penn & Teller!

04:42.980 --> 04:44.346
- Hey, Jill.
- Hi.

04:44.448 --> 04:45.939
What you working on?

04:46.016 --> 04:49.544
Oh, I have to write this essay
describing myself

04:49.620 --> 04:52.180
for the PhD application to U of M.

04:52.256 --> 04:56.421
Well, tell them you're brilliant,
insightful and a great humanitarian.

04:56.527 --> 04:59.361
- I am?
- No. But they don't know that, right?

04:59.897 --> 05:01.456
Brad, I can't screw this up.

05:01.565 --> 05:05.127
Some of us aren't soccer stars who can
count on getting a scholarship.

05:05.903 --> 05:08.031
In fact, some of us
are stuck working at the zoo,

05:08.105 --> 05:10.267
hosing out the penguin house.

05:12.810 --> 05:16.110
Well, that explains those feathers
in the lint trap.

05:17.081 --> 05:19.710
- Oh, your friend Jim called, Brad.
- Oh, yeah.

05:19.783 --> 05:22.912
He must be calling about that party
he's having Saturday night.

05:22.987 --> 05:25.218
The ladies are gonna be
rolling through there.

05:25.289 --> 05:27.815
Saturday night's all right for Brad.

05:29.293 --> 05:32.024
Actually, Saturday night's
kind of big for me, too.

05:32.096 --> 05:34.656
Chilly Millie's eggs are gonna hatch.

05:37.968 --> 05:39.493
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

05:39.570 --> 05:42.506
Say, did you guys catch
<i>Tool Time</i> today?

05:42.573 --> 05:44.439
Yeah. I actually did.

05:44.808 --> 05:45.935
You watched <i>Tool Time?</i>

05:46.010 --> 05:48.775
Yeah. I was trying to avoid
writing my essay.

05:50.080 --> 05:51.207
I was desperate.

05:51.282 --> 05:54.514
But, yeah, I really liked Penn & Teller.
They were great.

05:54.585 --> 05:57.282
Yeah. You know,
but some of the die-hard tool fans

05:57.354 --> 05:58.583
got to me after the show

05:58.656 --> 06:02.286
and said they're missing the regular,
basic <i>Tool Times</i>, you know?

06:02.359 --> 06:04.089
Wonder if I'm alienating my fan base?

06:04.161 --> 06:06.460
Don't worry. He'll forgive you.

06:10.467 --> 06:12.368
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Mark.

06:12.570 --> 06:15.062
What's the buzz about <i>Tool Time</i>
around school?

06:15.139 --> 06:17.165
No one's ever heard of it.

06:18.776 --> 06:21.007
Hey, what's this big wet spot?

06:21.211 --> 06:24.272
Oh, it looks like the hallway toilet
overflowed. I'll shut it off.

06:24.348 --> 06:26.647
Oh, no!
Like we need this right now.

06:26.717 --> 06:29.209
Would you go downstairs
in the basement and get some rags?

06:29.286 --> 06:30.447
- Sure.
- I can't believe it!

06:30.554 --> 06:33.183
We're gonna have to pull up the rug
and dry it out!

06:33.257 --> 06:34.486
Fix the toilet!

06:34.558 --> 06:37.460
You know, honey, as usual, you look
at a broken toilet as half-empty,

06:37.528 --> 06:39.497
I look at it as half-full.

06:40.431 --> 06:43.196
This is a perfect project to get
<i>Tool Time</i> back on track, huh?

06:43.267 --> 06:44.758
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:44.835 --> 06:46.106
No <i>Tool Times</i> in the house.
It's disruptive.

06:46.136 --> 06:47.741
You always end up
breaking something else.

06:47.771 --> 06:49.743
This broken toilet's too good
an opportunity to pass up.

06:49.773 --> 06:52.072
It's like that guy that saw a spring.

06:52.142 --> 06:55.237
He said, "That's not a spring.
That's a Slinky."

06:59.817 --> 07:01.581
Welcome back to <i>Tool Time</i>
on location.

07:01.652 --> 07:03.757
Today, we're gonna do a great
old-fashioned <i>Tool Time.</i>

07:03.787 --> 07:05.483
It's a hands-on one. You'll enjoy it.

07:05.556 --> 07:08.720
That's right.
You get to watch us in the bathroom.

07:10.494 --> 07:12.766
That's not all. Later, we're gonna
replace carpet padding.

07:12.796 --> 07:14.162
What a show!

07:15.232 --> 07:17.531
Okay, this toilet overflowed
through the top of the tank

07:17.601 --> 07:19.263
due to a broken float valve.

07:19.336 --> 07:21.771
Now, first you want to drain the tank,
loosen the nuts

07:21.839 --> 07:24.399
and remove
the old ball-cock assembly.

07:26.110 --> 07:29.740
Al's looking to do a similar procedure
with his own doctor.

07:31.749 --> 07:35.481
Right now, Al's gonna show us how
to install a high-tech float mechanism.

07:36.954 --> 07:38.616
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Cut! Sorry, guys.

07:38.689 --> 07:40.427
What's so important
you gotta interrupt the show?

07:40.457 --> 07:42.824
I need my earring and my mousse.

07:43.761 --> 07:46.424
Your earring's probably
in your mom's jewelry case.

07:46.497 --> 07:49.558
If you're looking for a moose,
go to a VFW hall.

07:51.268 --> 07:53.674
Okay, now we're gonna show you
how to deal with any water damage

07:53.704 --> 07:54.865
that may have occurred.

07:54.972 --> 07:57.441
In this case, it also damaged
some of the carpet pad.

07:57.508 --> 07:59.033
And the drywall in the ceiling.

07:59.109 --> 08:00.737
We're gonna show you
how to replace both.

08:00.811 --> 08:03.747
That's right. What could be a better
hands-on <i>Tool Time</i> than that?

08:03.814 --> 08:05.874
I started this show, what?
Nine years ago

08:05.949 --> 08:07.918
with just a dream and my hammer.

08:07.985 --> 08:11.251
And the best assistant
that minimum wage could buy.

08:11.755 --> 08:13.656
Oh, my God! Brad!

08:13.724 --> 08:15.095
- Are you all right?
- Cut, cut, cut!

08:15.125 --> 08:16.457
- Are you all right?
- My knee.

08:16.527 --> 08:19.395
Your knee? You hit your knee?
Okay, okay. Does this hurt?

08:19.463 --> 08:20.534
- Yes.
- What kind of hurt is it?

08:20.564 --> 08:21.769
- Pain!
- Okay. What kind of pain?

08:21.799 --> 08:24.098
- Pain!
- It's an emergency! Emergency!

08:24.168 --> 08:26.173
- Don't panic...
- Quick! Get a doc! Doctor, emergency!

08:26.203 --> 08:28.763
It's a good thing Binford has
a paramedic standing by, you know?

08:28.872 --> 08:30.500
Right here. Right this way. This way.

08:30.574 --> 08:32.475
He fell down the stairs.

08:36.880 --> 08:40.783
You might want to look at the guy
that's at the bottom of the stairs.

08:58.702 --> 09:01.729
- How's Brad doing?
- Oh, his tests are almost done.

09:01.805 --> 09:03.831
He'll be out of Radiology in a minute.

09:03.907 --> 09:05.746
I don't understand
why I couldn't go in there with him.

09:05.776 --> 09:09.144
Because you've had so many X-rays
you glow in the dark.

09:10.681 --> 09:12.616
I'm gonna check on Brad.

09:13.150 --> 09:16.211
Tim, don't touch anything.

10:01.865 --> 10:03.094
Okay, Brad.

10:03.167 --> 10:07.070
Dr. Brown is gonna come by
and give you your X-ray results.

10:07.137 --> 10:10.301
Okay, now, use some of your weight.
Ready, one, two, three, go.

10:22.719 --> 10:28.681
Okay, Brad, if your dad tries to touch
anything else, just hit him with this.

10:31.195 --> 10:32.424
Will do.

10:32.930 --> 10:34.558
How you feeling?

10:34.631 --> 10:36.036
I feel terrible. I mean, this sucks.

10:36.066 --> 10:37.830
I have a game to get ready
for on Sunday.

10:37.901 --> 10:39.870
I'll bet you'll be okay
by game time, huh?

10:39.970 --> 10:42.667
I came as fast as I could. Oh, my God!

10:42.739 --> 10:45.504
My poor baby.
What did the doctor say?

10:45.609 --> 10:47.915
They just got the X-rays,
and we're waiting for the results.

10:47.945 --> 10:49.505
- How did this happen?
- It was a fluke.

10:49.546 --> 10:50.951
You know, he wasn't watching
where he was going.

10:50.981 --> 10:52.506
He just tripped down the stairs.

10:52.683 --> 10:54.652
- Wait, wait. This is my fault?
- No fault.

10:54.751 --> 10:56.720
No, no, no.
It's because of his stupid <i>Tool Time.</i>

10:56.787 --> 10:58.559
- Oh, "stupid" <i>Tool Time?</i>
- Yes. Stupid <i>Tool Time.</i>

10:58.589 --> 11:00.460
Dad, you left the carpet
in the middle of the stairs!

11:00.490 --> 11:01.549
I didn't leave it there.

11:01.625 --> 11:03.797
It wouldn't have been there
if you'd waited to come down the stairs

11:03.827 --> 11:04.898
after we'd finished the scene.

11:04.928 --> 11:06.400
Hey, hey, hey, there's no point
assigning blame.

11:06.430 --> 11:07.634
- Yeah, well, he started it.
- I did not.

11:07.664 --> 11:08.893
- Did, too.
- Did not.

11:08.966 --> 11:10.059
Did, too.

11:10.133 --> 11:12.295
Guys! Guys, knock it off!

11:12.369 --> 11:14.508
The important thing is
it's gonna get taken care of, okay?

11:14.538 --> 11:15.562
Yeah.

11:16.273 --> 11:18.970
- Hello, Brad.
- Oh, hi. Hi. I'm Jill Taylor.

11:19.042 --> 11:20.738
Dr. Brown. Hi. Hi.

11:20.811 --> 11:22.677
- Hey, Dr. Brown.
- I know. Tim Taylor.

11:22.746 --> 11:26.205
Thanks to you we have a spanking new
CAT scan machine!

11:29.486 --> 11:32.354
So, Doctor, am I gonna be ready
for the game on Sunday?

11:32.422 --> 11:35.984
Well, I'm afraid
you won't be playing soccer for a while.

11:36.493 --> 11:37.586
What?

11:38.462 --> 11:40.897
You probably have a meniscal tear.

11:41.465 --> 11:44.025
Looks like you're gonna need surgery.

11:47.905 --> 11:49.999
Surgery. It's that serious?

11:50.941 --> 11:52.705
I can't believe this.

11:53.276 --> 11:56.838
Well, you know, as soon as it heals,
it'll be as good as new, right?

11:58.181 --> 11:59.740
It will be as good as new, right?

11:59.850 --> 12:02.911
Well, it's hard to say. Here.
Let me show you.

12:04.888 --> 12:07.016
The meniscus, which is right here,

12:07.090 --> 12:11.551
is a cartilage disk which acts
like a shock absorber for the knee joint.

12:11.728 --> 12:12.752
I see.

12:12.829 --> 12:16.197
It's like going over potholes
without your suspension.

12:18.168 --> 12:21.798
Yes, Mr. Taylor, it's just like that.

12:23.774 --> 12:26.266
There's no way to assess
the full extent of the damage

12:26.343 --> 12:28.107
until we get inside.

12:29.179 --> 12:31.739
Well, should we schedule the surgery
right away?

12:31.815 --> 12:34.876
Well, first I want to send you
to an orthopedic surgeon.

12:34.952 --> 12:38.252
He'll do an MRI to make sure
my diagnosis is correct.

12:39.156 --> 12:41.887
And until then, Brad, stay off that leg.

12:42.726 --> 12:44.888
Okay. Well, thank you, Dr. Brown.

12:44.962 --> 12:46.055
Okay.

12:47.597 --> 12:49.429
This is a total nightmare.

12:49.499 --> 12:51.638
I mean, with a blown knee,
I might never play soccer again.

12:51.668 --> 12:53.432
This could ruin my entire scholarship.

12:53.503 --> 12:55.404
- Now, you don't know that.
- No.

12:55.472 --> 12:59.409
And if that was eventually the case,
we could still pay for your college.

12:59.476 --> 13:02.708
And you'd be able to park closer
to the school then.

13:06.350 --> 13:09.022
Dad, I'm not even gonna get into
college without a soccer scholarship.

13:09.052 --> 13:11.325
If it wasn't for your stupid <i>Tool Time,</i>
this would've never happened!

13:11.355 --> 13:12.459
It wasn't my stupid <i>Tool Time.</i>

13:12.489 --> 13:13.961
- Yes, it is.
- There's no point blaming your dad.

13:13.991 --> 13:15.896
- Come on, Brad!
- Look, I'm sorry this happened.

13:15.926 --> 13:17.431
But we're not even sure
how serious this is yet.

13:17.461 --> 13:19.366
Yeah. You don't even know
if you're gonna have surgery.

13:19.396 --> 13:21.668
- Yeah, or my career could be over.
- Let's not talk like that.

13:21.698 --> 13:22.722
No. Wait.

13:22.799 --> 13:25.496
Sometimes it's helpful to play out
the worst-case scenario.

13:25.869 --> 13:27.741
All right. So, let's play out
the worst-case scenario.

13:27.771 --> 13:28.771
All right.

13:28.839 --> 13:30.777
I've blown my knee, my career's over,
I never get a job,

13:30.807 --> 13:32.969
I spend all my time
sitting on the couch, watching TV

13:33.076 --> 13:35.773
and picking potato chips
out of my cheesy mustache.

13:35.846 --> 13:37.940
Yeah, thanks! I feel great!

13:38.782 --> 13:41.877
That works much better
in my Psychology groups.

13:45.989 --> 13:49.482
Hey, Brad. Do you want us to drop you
by Jim's soccer party?

13:50.527 --> 13:51.790
Yo, Brad?

13:52.396 --> 13:54.763
Honey, do you want a ride or not?

13:54.898 --> 13:57.104
Yeah, I'm just dying to listen to people
talk about soccer

13:57.134 --> 14:00.036
while I limp around
like some washed-up loser.

14:00.103 --> 14:01.103
Well, do you want to go

14:01.171 --> 14:02.809
to the Saginaw Cheese Awards
banquet, huh?

14:02.839 --> 14:06.571
Yeah, your dad's nominated
for Car Guy of the Year again.

14:06.910 --> 14:10.142
He's gonna get
the Lifetime A-cheese-ment Award.

14:12.482 --> 14:16.112
I'd rather sit here
and relive the highlights of my youth.

14:16.486 --> 14:19.149
Okay. Well, you know,
maybe it's better if you get some rest

14:19.222 --> 14:21.248
before the operation, Monday.

14:21.691 --> 14:23.455
We'll see you later.

14:26.530 --> 14:28.624
So, what do you want to do?

14:29.466 --> 14:32.595
I want to sit here and think of all
the reasons why life sucks.

14:32.669 --> 14:34.035
Hey, cool.

14:39.876 --> 14:41.174
Hey, Wilson.

14:45.182 --> 14:46.343
Hey, Wilson.

14:46.683 --> 14:49.448
Oh. I'm sorry, Brad.
I was just meditating.

14:49.519 --> 14:51.351
Aren't you cold out here?

14:51.421 --> 14:53.447
Well, when I chant
"Om mani pa-toe-me foom"

14:53.523 --> 14:54.889
I'm trying to commune with nature.

14:54.991 --> 14:59.361
But now that you mention it,
I am freezing my pa-toe-mes off.

14:59.663 --> 15:01.029
Yeah. Living next to my dad,

15:01.098 --> 15:04.398
you're lucky your pa-toe-mes
are still in one piece.

15:04.935 --> 15:08.303
Well, obviously you're still upset
with him about your injury.

15:08.371 --> 15:10.738
Shouldn't you be inside,
resting that knee?

15:10.841 --> 15:14.334
Yeah. But if it wasn't for my dad,
I wouldn't have to rest it at all.

15:14.411 --> 15:17.677
You know, Brad,
you remind me of an Iban tribesman.

15:17.981 --> 15:20.143
Yeah. I get that all the time.

15:20.851 --> 15:22.615
You see, the Iban live in Borneo.

15:22.686 --> 15:25.656
And they believe that evil spirits
are the cause of all their misfortunes.

15:25.755 --> 15:27.690
So, every night they dance
and they put on

15:27.757 --> 15:29.521
these strange wooden masks

15:30.093 --> 15:32.562
to drive the evil spirits away.

15:32.963 --> 15:34.932
So, what does that have to do with me?

15:34.998 --> 15:36.536
Well, like the Iban,
we'd all like to believe

15:36.566 --> 15:39.627
that outside forces are the cause
of all of our problems.

15:39.703 --> 15:41.399
It gives rationality to our universe.

15:41.471 --> 15:45.238
But the truth is,
sometimes accidents just happen.

15:45.909 --> 15:48.469
So, you're saying that it's not
my dad's fault that I tripped.

15:48.545 --> 15:50.036
And it was more or less bad luck?

15:50.113 --> 15:51.547
Yeah, I suppose so.

15:51.615 --> 15:54.107
I think the thing to do
is just hope for the best

15:54.184 --> 15:56.915
and be open to exploring new paths.

15:56.987 --> 15:58.792
You know,
the British author, J.M. Barrie said,

15:58.822 --> 16:02.953
"A man's life is like a diary in which
he means to write one story,

16:03.927 --> 16:06.158
"but ends up writing another."

16:06.897 --> 16:09.799
Yeah, I know. But, Wilson, I mean,
soccer's always been part of my life.

16:09.866 --> 16:11.425
You know, it's, like, who I am.

16:11.501 --> 16:13.173
If you go to my school,
you can ask anybody.

16:13.203 --> 16:14.899
I'm Brad the soccer dude.

16:14.971 --> 16:18.271
But you can also be Brad
the nuclear-physicist dude.

16:18.875 --> 16:21.344
Or Brad the animal-husbandry dude.

16:23.280 --> 16:26.045
Yeah. But I don't know anything
about physics.

16:26.149 --> 16:30.416
And I really don't want to know what
it's like to be an animal's husband.

16:33.456 --> 16:35.322
You know, Brad, all I'm saying is,

16:35.392 --> 16:38.658
there's a whole world out there
for you to explore.

16:39.129 --> 16:41.189
So, there's gonna be
a lot of opportunities for me?

16:41.264 --> 16:44.234
Yes, exactly. That's the spirit.

16:44.734 --> 16:46.703
Let me ask you something.
Aside from soccer,

16:46.803 --> 16:49.568
have you thought about
what you want to focus on in college?

16:49.639 --> 16:51.608
Oh, yeah. I think about it all the time.

16:51.708 --> 16:53.267
Besides girls?

16:54.778 --> 16:55.905
Then, no.

16:57.547 --> 17:00.483
Well, that was quite a night for you.

17:00.550 --> 17:01.609
Yup.

17:07.624 --> 17:10.184
Saginaw Cheese's Car Guy of the Year

17:10.260 --> 17:12.559
for an unprecedented
three years running.

17:12.628 --> 17:14.859
And I just can't seem to enjoy it.

17:14.931 --> 17:17.833
Oh, come on, Tim.
They immortalized you in Gouda.

17:19.402 --> 17:21.962
Yeah, but with Brad so mad at me,
this trophy of cheese

17:22.038 --> 17:23.700
seems almost meaningless.

17:25.976 --> 17:27.705
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey.

17:28.912 --> 17:30.175
Hey, Dad.

17:30.714 --> 17:33.548
So, you decided to go to the party
after all?

17:33.617 --> 17:35.347
Yeah. What smells so good?

17:35.418 --> 17:36.647
My head.

17:38.855 --> 17:40.527
- Cool. How'd the banquet go?
- It was great.

17:40.557 --> 17:41.895
Three years running, I'm the champ.

17:41.925 --> 17:43.430
The Lifetime A-cheese-ment Award,
everything.

17:43.460 --> 17:47.124
I met Mrs. Cheese, the Muenster twins,
everybody was there.

17:47.864 --> 17:49.799
You sound like you're in a better mood.

17:49.866 --> 17:52.097
Yeah. I just realized I was blaming you

17:52.168 --> 17:55.332
because I was seeking rationality
in my universe.

17:58.208 --> 17:59.972
That's some pretty heavy thinking.

18:00.043 --> 18:02.410
Well, you know me. I'm very deep.

18:03.113 --> 18:05.673
- You been talking to Wilson?
- Yeah, that, too.

18:06.716 --> 18:09.185
Well, I'm glad you're not mad
at your dad anymore.

18:09.252 --> 18:11.949
Yeah. I was just mad at the situation.

18:12.388 --> 18:13.788
I mean, it's really nobody's fault.

18:13.857 --> 18:15.962
That shows a lot of maturity,
the way you're working through this.

18:15.992 --> 18:20.225
You know, I really should put
your father's head in the refrigerator.

18:20.897 --> 18:23.059
I'm just sorry you got to go through
any of this, Brad.

18:23.166 --> 18:24.293
Yeah. Me, too.

18:24.367 --> 18:28.304
But I just have to use this injury as
an opportunity to think about my future.

18:28.438 --> 18:30.270
Your future. You got a lot of options!

18:30.340 --> 18:32.969
I know. But then why do I feel sick
to my stomach?

18:33.043 --> 18:34.347
Well, because it's kind of scary,

18:34.377 --> 18:36.082
thinking of your life going
in an opposite direction

18:36.112 --> 18:37.603
than it was before this, you know?

18:37.680 --> 18:40.650
Yeah, I never thought
I'd have to think about this now.

18:40.750 --> 18:43.242
I figured I'd be playing soccer
well into my 60s.

18:43.320 --> 18:46.347
Yeah. The only soccer player out there
in a walker.

18:46.956 --> 18:49.448
I'll get it. Hold on, I'll get it.

18:56.833 --> 18:58.301
It's too big.

18:58.735 --> 19:02.297
You guys are just gonna have to eat
through the cranium tonight.

19:03.740 --> 19:05.470
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night.

19:06.009 --> 19:07.671
I'll be right up.

19:08.778 --> 19:10.610
What were we talking about?

19:10.680 --> 19:13.115
We were talking about
what I want to do with my life.

19:13.183 --> 19:14.276
Well, you're 17 years old.

19:14.350 --> 19:16.389
I don't think we gotta figure that out
right now, do we?

19:16.419 --> 19:17.590
Yeah. Well, that's easy for you to say.

19:17.620 --> 19:19.054
You knew what you were gonna do.

19:19.122 --> 19:20.122
No, I didn't.

19:20.190 --> 19:22.395
I figured I was gonna be
a Binford salesman the rest of my life.

19:22.425 --> 19:25.054
I never figured I'd be the head guy
on a tool show.

19:25.128 --> 19:27.563
Or would that be the big cheese?

19:28.899 --> 19:30.663
Or the head cheese.

19:33.503 --> 19:36.223
Look, I don't know what your future's
gonna bring and neither do you.

19:36.272 --> 19:38.178
I just know that if you work hard
like you do at soccer,

19:38.208 --> 19:40.439
you can be good at anything, Brad.

19:40.510 --> 19:41.876
Yeah, I hope so.

19:41.945 --> 19:45.006
- Listen, I'm sorry I was such a jerk.
- It's okay, it's okay.

19:45.081 --> 19:47.141
- I'm hungry. You?
- Yeah, I'm starving.

19:47.217 --> 19:49.584
Hey, how about... I don't know...

19:50.086 --> 19:51.850
Macaroni and cheeks?

19:53.123 --> 19:55.422
How about some nose and crackers?

19:55.492 --> 19:56.516
I like it.

19:56.593 --> 19:58.255
I'll get a knife, I'll cut the cheese.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.491
Slowly, honey.

20:08.138 --> 20:09.800
How'd the physical therapy go?

20:09.872 --> 20:10.931
It went great.

20:11.007 --> 20:12.847
They said I'm healing really fast
from surgery.

20:12.909 --> 20:15.048
And they said I have a good chance
of playing soccer again.

20:15.078 --> 20:16.842
- All right!
- Where's your dad?

20:16.946 --> 20:18.710
Oh, he's out in the backyard.

20:18.815 --> 20:20.545
I think he's got a little surprise for you.

20:21.217 --> 20:22.378
No.

20:32.195 --> 20:33.561
Check it out.

20:34.164 --> 20:37.259
No, it's Binford's new experimental
all-terrain chair.

20:37.333 --> 20:41.236
Now you can heal at 40 miles an hour.

20:41.471 --> 20:43.309
So you expect me to ride this thing
around town.

20:43.339 --> 20:47.572
It's great. Two-cylinder, 46 horsepower.
This thing is wonderful.

20:47.677 --> 20:49.236
All-wheel drive.

20:50.580 --> 20:52.549
After this, we could go down
to the rest home

20:52.649 --> 20:54.117
and do some drag racing.

20:54.184 --> 20:56.210
Old Man Brady's
been talking trash again.

20:56.286 --> 20:58.050
Steering is pretty intense.

20:58.121 --> 21:00.818
You just point it where you want to go.

21:19.476 --> 21:22.156
Hey, Brad, you want us to take...
You want us to take you over to...

21:24.948 --> 21:27.315
Hey, Brad, you want us to take...

21:29.519 --> 21:31.488
Hey, Brad. You want us to...

21:36.292 --> 21:38.193
Do you want us to drop you by...

21:38.261 --> 21:39.661
It's gonna come out like that, see?

21:39.729 --> 21:42.858
Hey, Brad. Do you want us to
drop you by that Jim's soccer party?

21:44.467 --> 21:45.992
Huh? You'd like to...

21:46.069 --> 21:48.903
I'll get a knife, I'll cut the cheese.

21:51.507 --> 21:52.975
I just did.
