00:02.001 --> 00:03.711
Previously on Lost:

00:10.260 --> 00:12.261
Do you think he's gonna live?

00:12.888 --> 00:15.848
- Do you know him?
- He was sitting next to me.

00:16.308 --> 00:18.393
You think they
would have come by now.

00:19.353 --> 00:22.146
- Who?
- Anyone.

00:22.648 --> 00:24.023
What is it, like checkers?

00:24.108 --> 00:26.984
Not really.
It's a better game than checkers.

00:27.069 --> 00:29.487
Two players. Two sides.

00:29.571 --> 00:32.782
One is light. One is dark.

00:34.201 --> 00:35.868
Walt...

00:37.371 --> 00:39.038
...do you wanna know a secret?

01:01.645 --> 01:03.771
Don't trust her.

01:03.856 --> 01:05.857
She's dangerous.

01:05.941 --> 01:10.278
- Try not to move, man.
- I have to find her.

01:10.362 --> 01:13.740
- I have to bring her back.
- Yeah, you keep saying that.

01:13.824 --> 01:17.326
Every time I ask who you have to
bring back, you pass out on me again.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.705
Since your fever's pretty high,
I'm guessing you have no idea

01:20.789 --> 01:23.750
- who the hell you're talking about.
- My cuffs.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.835
My handcuffs.

01:26.336 --> 01:30.047
- Where are my cuffs?
- What?

01:32.509 --> 01:34.886
- My jacket pocket.
- I don't...

01:34.970 --> 01:37.555
- Jacket pocket!
- Okay.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.982
Dangerous.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.318
She's dangerous.

02:11.715 --> 02:14.008
- It's getting dark.
- Then pick up the pace.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.177
- Hick.
- A little louder?

02:16.261 --> 02:17.762
We should make camp.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.972
- What, here?
- Yes, here.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.433
I'm not stopping.
Y'all have a nice cookout.

02:22.518 --> 02:25.978
- Walk through the jungle in the dark.
- The trees are gonna get us?

02:26.063 --> 02:29.023
No. What is knocking
down the trees will get you.

02:29.107 --> 02:31.859
You're so worried,
how about give me the clip back?

02:31.944 --> 02:33.361
Put your gun in your pants.

02:33.445 --> 02:36.948
Sayid's right. Keep walking,
you're not gonna make it to the beach.

02:37.032 --> 02:39.450
Yeah, why's that?

02:41.829 --> 02:43.746
Trust me.

02:44.456 --> 02:45.873
This is Australia.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.210
- This is us.
- Nice stick.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.629
Two days ago, we take off from Sydney.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.673
We fly along the same northeast route

02:53.757 --> 02:56.551
every commercial airliner
bound for Los Angeles does.

02:56.635 --> 02:59.512
The pilot said he lost
communication with the ground?

02:59.596 --> 03:02.598
Yeah, six hours in.
He turned around and headed for Fiji.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.141
So we changed course.

03:04.226 --> 03:07.228
Regrettably,
no one knew we changed course.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.772
The turbulence hit.

03:10.649 --> 03:11.774
We know the rest.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.361
The pilot said we were
over 1,000 miles off course.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.407
Yeah, but they'll find us.

03:19.491 --> 03:23.077
They have satellites that
take pictures of your license plate.

03:23.161 --> 03:25.621
If only we were all
wearing license plates.

03:26.164 --> 03:29.709
- Aren't you the pessimist.
- Basic photography: point and shoot.

03:29.793 --> 03:33.462
Satellites can shoot,
but they must be told where to point.

03:35.507 --> 03:36.883
Bollocks.

03:36.967 --> 03:39.927
Okay, really enjoyed
the puppet show. Fantastic.

03:40.012 --> 03:42.680
So we're stuck in
the middle of damn nowhere.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.974
How about we talk
about that other thing?

03:46.101 --> 03:49.103
The transmission
Abdul picked up on his little radio.

03:49.187 --> 03:52.231
The French chick that said,
"They're all dead."

03:52.316 --> 03:55.568
The transmission's been on a loop for...
How long, Freckles?

03:56.778 --> 03:59.780
- Sixteen years.
- Right.

03:59.865 --> 04:02.199
Let's talk about that.

04:05.996 --> 04:08.539
Well, we have to tell
the others when we get back.

04:08.624 --> 04:11.542
- Tell them what exactly?
- What we heard.

04:11.627 --> 04:14.837
- I'm not a stupid translator.
- No one tell them anything.

04:16.130 --> 04:20.301
To relay what we heard without fully
understanding it will cause a panic.

04:21.845 --> 04:25.097
If we tell them what we know...

04:25.182 --> 04:27.767
...we take away their hope.

04:28.226 --> 04:31.896
And hope is a very
dangerous thing to lose.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.358
So we lie?

04:41.698 --> 04:44.241
- Was it a dinosaur?
- It wasn't a dinosaur.

04:44.326 --> 04:48.621
- You said you didn't see it.
- I didn't.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.790
So how do you know it wasn't a dinosaur?

04:50.874 --> 04:52.708
Because dinosaurs are extinct.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.545
Yeah.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.344
So, what's his story?
He looks kind of...

05:04.304 --> 05:06.180
- ...dying.
- He's not gonna die.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.307
- He's yellow.
- His wound is infected,

05:08.392 --> 05:11.811
- but the antibiotics will fight it off.
- What if they don't?

05:13.230 --> 05:15.481
Then his body will shut down...

05:15.565 --> 05:17.149
...one piece at a time.

05:17.234 --> 05:20.027
His abdomen goes rigid, then...

05:24.408 --> 05:26.742
He looks like he's in pain.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.744
Yeah.

05:32.708 --> 05:33.916
What's this?

05:37.587 --> 05:38.587
Dude?

05:44.761 --> 05:47.388
- What do you think she did?
- None of my business.

05:47.472 --> 05:50.057
- She looks pretty hardcore.
- Hurley.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.725
What are you doing?

06:33.685 --> 06:36.771
I'm standing guard.
You heard what they said's out there.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.439
You took my gun off me, boy?

06:38.523 --> 06:41.233
He doesn't believe in guns.
He goes on marches.

06:41.318 --> 06:43.069
- I don't.
- Give it back.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.780
- Aljazeera will protect us.
- Aljazeera's a network.

06:45.864 --> 06:49.283
- I'll keep the damn gun.
- We should give it to her.

06:54.539 --> 06:57.958
- Yeah. Kate should hold the gun.
- Fine with me.

07:01.671 --> 07:02.671
Well?

07:21.066 --> 07:23.818
- Good morning.
- Morning.

07:23.902 --> 07:28.364
- You're sleeping in my sheep pen.
- Sorry.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.329
- How'd you get here?
- I walked.

07:35.413 --> 07:36.705
- You walked?
- Yeah.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.667
- From where?
- Town.

07:39.751 --> 07:42.795
- Nearest town's 15 kilometers.
- That's why I'm exhausted.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.338
What's your name?

07:45.549 --> 07:48.968
- Annie.
- You hungry, Annie?

07:53.431 --> 07:58.018
So you want to tell me why
you're trespassing on my property?

07:58.270 --> 08:00.187
I ran out of money.

08:01.439 --> 08:02.565
You're an American?

08:03.567 --> 08:07.278
Canadian. I graduated from college
and figured I'd see the world.

08:07.362 --> 08:10.656
Australia was top of my list,
so I hopped a flight to Melbourne,

08:10.740 --> 08:14.410
but I don't know anybody here,
so I figured I'd walk for a while.

08:14.494 --> 08:17.371
Melbourne's a hundred
kilometers from here.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.039
I like walking.

08:19.124 --> 08:21.625
And you just happened
to wander onto my farm?

08:21.710 --> 08:24.086
I like farms too.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.510
Do you know how to work one?

08:34.389 --> 08:35.556
Yeah.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.354
My wife died
eight months ago Wednesday.

08:43.607 --> 08:47.151
She left me with too many chores
and a hell of a mortgage.

08:48.278 --> 08:50.487
If you help me with the first one,

08:50.572 --> 08:52.907
I'll give you a fair wage
and a place to stay.

08:56.411 --> 08:57.578
Deal.

09:01.124 --> 09:03.083
I'm a lefty.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.214
Dude. Dude!

09:09.633 --> 09:12.218
Hey, dude, they're back.

09:13.637 --> 09:17.014
As you and the others know,
we hiked up the mountain in an attempt

09:17.098 --> 09:19.975
to help the rescue team locate us.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.604
The transceiver failed
to pick up a signal.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.732
We weren't able to send out
a call for help.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.692
But we're not giving up.

09:28.777 --> 09:32.571
If we gather electronic equipment,
your cell phones, laptops,

09:32.656 --> 09:34.990
I can boost the signal
and we can try again.

09:35.659 --> 09:38.118
But that may take some time,
so for now,

09:38.203 --> 09:40.913
we should begin
rationing our remaining food.

09:40.997 --> 09:44.833
If it rains, we should set up tarps
to collect water.

09:44.918 --> 09:48.087
I need to organize
three separate groups.

09:48.171 --> 09:51.465
Each group should have a leader.
One group for water.

09:51.549 --> 09:56.679
I'll organize that. Who's gonna organize
electronics? You? Rationing food?

09:57.180 --> 09:59.348
Okay.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.893
And I will need a third group
to concern themselves with...

10:04.145 --> 10:06.272
- Hi.
- Hey.

10:09.693 --> 10:13.696
I... I need to tell you something.

10:15.865 --> 10:18.200
Okay. Sure.

10:23.540 --> 10:26.292
We couldn't send out a signal

10:26.376 --> 10:29.545
because there was
another signal blocking it.

10:31.047 --> 10:34.800
The other signal, we heard it.

10:36.219 --> 10:38.679
It was a distress call
from a French woman.

10:38.763 --> 10:41.432
She said that the others were dead.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.934
That something had killed them all.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.895
She was alone on the island.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.817
It's been playing for 16 years, Jack.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.995
I wanted to tell you.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.296
Anything else?

11:19.179 --> 11:22.264
How is he?
The man with the shrapnel in his side.

11:25.143 --> 11:28.937
- He's touch and go.
- Did he wake up?

11:29.981 --> 11:32.399
Just for a few seconds
during the surgery.

11:33.985 --> 11:35.194
He say anything?

11:39.157 --> 11:41.617
No.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.091
So, what did she say?

11:57.592 --> 11:59.843
She didn't say anything.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.679
But you told her you knew.

12:04.724 --> 12:05.974
I don't know anything.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.560
Well, you kinda know
she's in that mug shot.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.229
And we found those handcuffs.

12:10.313 --> 12:14.316
And that guy keeps mumbling
"She's dangerous," over and over.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.778
It's not my business. Not my problem.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.743
Yeah, you're right.

12:24.828 --> 12:27.996
We'll let Johnny Fever take care
of her when he gets better.

12:28.081 --> 12:31.417
He's not getting better if we
don't get stronger antibiotics.

12:31.501 --> 12:35.254
- That stuff from the luggage...
- For ear infections and foot fungus.

12:35.338 --> 12:36.922
We went through everything.

12:37.006 --> 12:40.050
What about that luggage
in the overhead compartments?

12:40.677 --> 12:43.303
- That's inside the plane.
- Yeah?

12:44.431 --> 12:46.807
But the bodies are in there,

12:47.350 --> 12:50.394
and they're all... dead.

12:53.815 --> 12:57.651
- I'll handle it. Keep an eye on...
- Great. Yeah, I'd love to. On it.

13:40.695 --> 13:43.614
- What are you doing?
- Trick-or-treat. Same as you.

13:43.698 --> 13:45.073
You're looting.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.951
You say potato.

13:48.453 --> 13:52.915
- What's in the bag?
- Booze, smokes, a couple Playboys.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.792
- What's in yours?
- Medicine.

13:55.877 --> 13:58.837
Well, just about sums it up, don't it?

13:58.922 --> 14:02.007
You do this back home too?
Steal from the dead?

14:02.091 --> 14:05.093
Brother, you got to wake up
and smell the gull crap here.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.513
Rescue ain't coming.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.016
You're just wasting your time,

14:11.100 --> 14:13.852
trying to save a guy who,
last time I checked,

14:13.937 --> 14:18.148
had a piece of metal the size of my head
sticking out of his bread basket.

14:19.442 --> 14:21.109
Let me ask you something.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.987
How many of those pills
you gonna use to fix him up?

14:24.072 --> 14:26.740
- As many as it takes.
- Yeah?

14:26.824 --> 14:28.200
How many you got?

14:33.623 --> 14:36.458
You're just not looking
at the big picture, doc.

14:36.960 --> 14:42.047
- You're still back in civilization.
- Yeah? And where are you?

14:42.131 --> 14:45.842
Me? I'm in the wild.

15:00.650 --> 15:03.402
Hey, I got it. I got it.

15:04.654 --> 15:08.532
- Thanks.
- I got it. I got it. Yeah.

15:11.703 --> 15:13.328
Well, look on the bright side.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.290
Whoever's this was is probably
better off than we are.

15:16.374 --> 15:17.958
I got it.

15:54.621 --> 15:57.623
- How's the baby?
- It's okay, I think.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.875
Good.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.085
So your...

16:02.170 --> 16:04.630
Your husband,
was he on the flight?

16:04.714 --> 16:06.715
Oh, no, I'm not married.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.887
I know. How modern of me.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.307
Well, who needs men, right?

16:15.391 --> 16:16.933
Bloody useless.

16:20.688 --> 16:24.399
So you guys hiked all the way up
that mountain for nothing, huh?

16:28.946 --> 16:30.781
Hey. Sorry.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.992
I was gonna get some more water.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.452
We haven't met. I'm Kate.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.499
- Hi, Kate.
- Hi.

16:43.753 --> 16:45.003
Hurley.

16:46.214 --> 16:48.924
I was looking for Jack,
I thought he might be there.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.342
Yeah, no.

16:50.426 --> 16:53.303
He went to go get some medicine.
Over there.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.851
- Where, in the fuselage?
- What?

16:59.936 --> 17:02.562
Yeah. Yeah, in the...

17:04.773 --> 17:07.317
You know,
I got to go get that water.

17:58.786 --> 18:01.288
The bank would have
given you a heck of a toaster

18:01.372 --> 18:03.540
if you'd kept that in a savings account.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.751
What do I need a toaster for?

18:05.835 --> 18:08.962
You're hiding your wages
in a tin can, Annie.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.882
I mean, I would have
held onto it for you.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.384
I got trust issues.

18:19.140 --> 18:22.434
- Weren't you gonna say goodbye?
- I wrote you a note.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.607
You've been here
almost three months,

18:28.691 --> 18:30.776
and every time
I ask you about yourself,

18:30.860 --> 18:33.528
you get that look in your eye.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.322
Yeah, that one.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.700
So I mind my own business.

18:38.785 --> 18:42.287
I figured maybe you got off on the
wrong side of a bad relationship.

18:42.371 --> 18:46.249
Maybe you ran. I always knew
you'd leave here someday.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.836
I guess I hoped it wouldn't
be in the middle of the night.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.633
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.844
So am I.

19:03.059 --> 19:05.936
Annie, why don't you
just stay one more night?

19:06.020 --> 19:10.398
I'll drive you to the train station
first thing in the morning. I promise.

19:15.738 --> 19:18.573
- Okay.
- Good.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.409
I get it, you know.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.787
Everyone deserves a fresh start.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.064
Damn it!
Let her go, damn it!

19:56.612 --> 19:58.613
Breathe! Come on!

19:58.698 --> 20:01.575
Come on. Look at me! Look...

20:06.122 --> 20:08.081
What did you do?

20:08.207 --> 20:10.959
I was just checking to see if he...

20:11.544 --> 20:14.379
He jumped on me.
He grabbed me.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.636
Is he... okay now?

20:22.096 --> 20:24.222
He's not responding to antibiotics,

20:24.307 --> 20:27.601
he's bleeding internally,
his fever's pushing 104...

20:29.145 --> 20:31.021
...and his abdomen's rigid.

20:41.115 --> 20:43.116
He needs water.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.372
So, what are you gonna do about it?

20:49.457 --> 20:51.166
- About what?
- About him.

20:51.250 --> 20:54.210
- I told you, he needs water.
- Will he suffer?

20:55.796 --> 20:58.882
- What?
- Will it be quick?

20:58.966 --> 21:00.842
No, it won't be quick.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.762
- Two, three, maybe four days.
- And he'll feel it?

21:03.846 --> 21:06.097
Yeah, he'll feel it.

21:06.182 --> 21:08.975
Can't you put him out of his misery?

21:15.024 --> 21:17.442
I saw your mug shot, Kate.

21:17.693 --> 21:20.862
I am not a murderer.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.633
Do they listen to Patsy Cline in Canada?

21:41.717 --> 21:44.094
They listen to Patsy Cline everywhere.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.225
- You hungry?
- I'll eat on the train.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.935
You sure?

21:52.019 --> 21:54.729
A little place up here
makes a mean burger.

22:00.236 --> 22:02.988
- What are you looking for, Ray?
- What?

22:03.072 --> 22:05.281
I'm not. Just...

22:15.876 --> 22:17.502
How long have you known?

22:19.255 --> 22:21.548
Couple of days.

22:21.632 --> 22:24.175
I saw your picture in the post office.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.386
I guess they knew
you were Down Under.

22:28.514 --> 22:32.434
- Why?
- The reward's $23,000.

22:33.436 --> 22:36.771
I told you when I met you.
I got a hell of a mortgage.

22:37.732 --> 22:41.526
If it makes you feel any better,
it was a hard decision, Annie.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.778
My name's not Annie.

23:13.225 --> 23:16.519
- Who's that you were hanging out with?
- What guy?

23:16.604 --> 23:19.898
- You know, the bald guy.
- Oh, Mr. Locke?

23:19.982 --> 23:21.816
Mr. Locke.

23:22.818 --> 23:25.779
- Mr. Locke got any kids?
- He didn't say.

23:26.155 --> 23:28.740
- Yeah, what did he say?
- I don't know.

23:28.824 --> 23:31.743
What do you mean,
you don't know? What did he say?

23:31.827 --> 23:33.495
Some of it's secret.

23:34.914 --> 23:38.083
- He tell you not to tell me?
- No.

23:38.167 --> 23:39.667
Then what's the secret?

23:43.005 --> 23:46.424
Mr. Locke said
a miracle happened here.

23:49.553 --> 23:52.305
Yeah, well, a miracle
happened to all of us, Walt.

23:52.389 --> 23:55.141
We survived the plane crash.

23:55.851 --> 23:59.020
- I don't want you hanging around him.
- Why? He's my friend.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.399
Hey, I'm your friend too.

24:03.484 --> 24:05.860
If you're my friend, you'd find Vincent.

24:07.238 --> 24:09.364
Walt...

24:10.699 --> 24:13.952
Look, I haven't given up on your dog.

24:14.036 --> 24:16.287
I'm gonna do everything
I can to find him.

24:16.372 --> 24:18.915
- You won't. You don't care.
- Yeah, I will.

24:18.999 --> 24:21.960
I'm gonna get your dog back
as soon as it stops raining.

24:22.044 --> 24:25.004
Listen to me.
I'm gonna get your dog back.

24:33.973 --> 24:36.516
As soon as it stops raining.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.227
Good. Nice.

24:40.896 --> 24:43.439
I'm gonna find your dog.

24:43.816 --> 24:47.777
I'm just gonna go walking through
the haunted damn jungle,

24:48.529 --> 24:50.613
looking for your...

24:55.911 --> 24:57.704
Vincent?

25:05.921 --> 25:07.964
Vincent.

25:08.048 --> 25:09.841
That you, buddy?

25:37.203 --> 25:40.955
Something was chasing me, so...

25:43.209 --> 25:48.046
Yeah, I don't hear it now.
But you should probably...

25:50.549 --> 25:53.259
...head back.

25:57.765 --> 25:59.974
I didn't see anything.

26:02.394 --> 26:05.688
You know,
if you're worried about it,

26:05.773 --> 26:08.149
I didn't see anything.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.841
What are you making?

26:37.429 --> 26:39.347
A whistle.

26:41.809 --> 26:46.104
I used some tribal flutes once
in a recording session.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.149
I'm in a band.

27:00.286 --> 27:04.998
- I wish he would just die already.
- Real humane, Shannon.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.211
Anything I can do to help?

27:11.380 --> 27:14.257
No, I'm good. Thanks.

27:15.175 --> 27:19.387
The others are getting upset. They want
to know what's going on inside the tent.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.390
I'm trying to save his life.

27:23.017 --> 27:25.435
Rumor has it you can't.

27:54.256 --> 27:56.257
You need a light?

28:05.100 --> 28:07.518
Came by to thank you.

28:10.272 --> 28:13.399
- You gonna ask what for?
- What for?

28:15.277 --> 28:18.112
- Taking that gun away from me.
- I didn't take it away.

28:18.197 --> 28:21.115
Stickin' out of your denims, ain't it?

28:25.204 --> 28:28.831
Sure wouldn't want to be
the one with that gun right now.

28:30.793 --> 28:34.545
Everyone sitting out here listening
to that poor boy scream all night

28:34.630 --> 28:36.798
knows what's got to be done.

28:37.132 --> 28:41.260
Only one that can do it
is the one with that gun.

28:42.429 --> 28:46.974
Don't act so surprised. I heard
you tell the hero the same thing.

28:49.019 --> 28:51.896
Hell, there's only one bullet left.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.482
Be damn near poetic.

29:15.629 --> 29:17.755
- Listen...
- No, you need to keep quiet.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.383
Listen to me.
No matter what she does,

29:20.467 --> 29:22.427
no matter how she makes you feel,

29:22.511 --> 29:25.596
just don't...
trust a word that she says.

29:25.681 --> 29:29.809
She will do anything to get away.

29:32.062 --> 29:34.272
- What did she do?
- I want to talk to her.

29:34.356 --> 29:38.443
- Tell me what she did.
- I want to talk to her alone.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.242
She got to you too, huh?

31:59.167 --> 32:01.210
Hey, Kate.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.635
What was it?

32:12.347 --> 32:14.640
- What?
- The favor.

32:14.891 --> 32:17.018
I don't know what you're talking about.

32:17.102 --> 32:21.439
Last thing I heard before the crash,
you wanted a favor.

32:32.618 --> 32:35.870
The captain has switched on
the "fasten seatbelts" sign.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.623
Return to your seats
and fasten your seatbelts.

32:38.707 --> 32:42.960
- I have one favor to ask.
- Really? This ought to be good.

33:09.821 --> 33:10.946
Well?

33:15.911 --> 33:19.664
I wanted you to make sure
that Ray Mullen got his 23 grand.

33:24.586 --> 33:28.172
What, the guy who ratted you out?

33:30.258 --> 33:32.593
He had a hell of a mortgage.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.679
Kate...

33:34.763 --> 33:37.181
...you really are one of a kind.

33:42.854 --> 33:46.482
You know, you would have got away
if you hadn't saved him.

33:48.985 --> 33:51.821
In case you hadn't noticed,
I did get away.

33:51.905 --> 33:54.198
You don't look free to me.

33:56.827 --> 34:00.121
Kate, I'm gonna die, right?

34:07.629 --> 34:10.297
- Yeah.
- So...

34:10.382 --> 34:13.426
...are you gonna do it...

34:13.510 --> 34:15.928
...or what?

34:24.688 --> 34:26.981
Yo.

34:29.317 --> 34:32.069
So, where's the fugitive?

34:33.655 --> 34:36.991
- In the tent.
- You let her in there alone?

34:37.951 --> 34:41.120
What's she gonna do?
She's 120 pounds soaking wet.

34:41.204 --> 34:43.831
Yeah, but she's got that gun.

34:43.915 --> 34:47.042
- What?
- She's strapped, man. I saw it in...

34:51.297 --> 34:53.424
Kate.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.446
- What did you do?
- What you couldn't.

35:16.656 --> 35:19.533
I get where you're coming from,
being a doctor and all.

35:19.618 --> 35:22.661
But he wanted it.
Hell, he asked me.

35:22.746 --> 35:25.831
So I don't like it
any more than you do...

35:25.916 --> 35:28.542
...but something had to be done.

35:31.922 --> 35:34.381
Oh, no way.

35:35.008 --> 35:36.717
Guys.

35:43.558 --> 35:46.769
- You shot him in the chest?
- I was aiming for his heart.

35:46.853 --> 35:49.647
- You missed.
- Man, is he still breathing?

35:49.731 --> 35:53.734
You perforated his lung.
It'll take hours to bleed out.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.778
There was...

35:55.862 --> 35:58.155
- I only had one bullet.
- Get out.

35:59.407 --> 36:01.075
Get out!

36:24.766 --> 36:26.851
Damn it!

37:50.727 --> 37:52.853
I found your son's dog.

37:53.146 --> 37:55.397
- What?
- Vincent?

37:55.482 --> 37:58.692
I tethered him
to a tree just over there.

37:59.486 --> 38:01.737
I know that Walt lost his mom.

38:01.821 --> 38:06.367
I thought that you should be the one
to bring his dog back to him.

38:09.871 --> 38:12.748
- Hey, thanks.
- Welcome.

38:42.612 --> 38:44.446
I want to tell you what I did.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.702
Why he was after me.

38:51.204 --> 38:53.414
I don't want to know.

38:55.417 --> 38:57.751
It doesn't matter, Kate,

38:57.836 --> 39:02.297
who we were, what we did before this,
before the crash.

39:02.424 --> 39:04.591
It doesn't really...

39:10.098 --> 39:12.558
Three days ago, we all died.

39:14.894 --> 39:17.938
We should all be able to start over.

39:29.743 --> 39:33.579
- Okay.
- Okay?
