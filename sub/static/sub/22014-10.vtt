19:58.365 --> 19:59.732
Shh.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.834
Thanks, Dad.
Dark meat's my favorite.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.836
Oh, dark meat. I know
it's your favorite.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.872
Are those reindeer
hooking up?

20:05.905 --> 20:08.608
No, they're dancing!

20:08.641 --> 20:09.909
Oh, wait.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.544
Dylan:
Is this thing even on?

20:11.578 --> 20:13.980
It is. Thanks
for the camera, sis.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.550
* We wish you a sexy Christmas
and a funky New Year *

20:17.584 --> 20:19.185
Ooh.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.187
Young man: Still on!
Thanks for this, Ray.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.391
Look out, ladies.
He's single.

20:24.424 --> 20:27.260
I appreciate all the times
you've listened to me,

20:27.294 --> 20:29.796
even though you
couldn't hear me.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.265
I've been listening
to you, too.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.038
-Oh!

20:39.071 --> 20:42.275
It's not a service dog,
but it is a family dog.

20:42.309 --> 20:44.944
Thanks.

20:44.977 --> 20:47.079
Merry Christmas, everyone.

Taylor.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.964
I don't have your jacket, if
that's what you came here for.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.433
No, I came to see you.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.468
I thought your mom said you
couldn't see me anymore.

21:08.501 --> 21:10.937
She did. And I've never wanted
to see you more.

21:10.970 --> 21:13.306
You're the bad boy.

21:13.340 --> 21:16.909
That's who I am! I'm the guy you
don't take home to see Mom!

21:16.943 --> 21:18.445
It was almost too obvious.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.313
I guess it's time
to break curfew.

21:20.347 --> 21:22.482
[ Clunk ]
Ow. Ow. That kills.

21:22.515 --> 21:25.117
Ohh!
Can we break curfew tomorrow?

21:25.151 --> 21:27.053
Bad boy needs some ice.
