00:01.702 --> 00:02.968
     NARRATOR: Tonight on
  The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.070 --> 00:04.837
             GARY:
We're heading to Apple Island.

00:04.939 --> 00:06.538
-JACK: Do you see what I see?
     -TONY: Oh, my God.

00:06.640 --> 00:08.240
        -We're dead on.
  -GARY: The star map theory

00:08.342 --> 00:10.509
       -could be correct.
 -BRENNAN: Hold the phone, boys!

00:10.611 --> 00:12.378
       -The plot thickens.
 -MARTY: The Money Pit collapsed

00:12.480 --> 00:15.047
     in 1861 and we're in
      the debris field.

00:15.149 --> 00:17.316
 ROB H.: This stone was used
  as something in the past,

00:17.418 --> 00:19.118
 and it has caused certain areas
     to wear off completely.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.053
 Those are letters inscribed
       into the stone.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.188
       Without a doubt,
      this is the stone.

00:23.290 --> 00:24.189
        -TERRY: Whoa!
   -LAIRD: This definitely

00:24.291 --> 00:25.924
        isn't on any map.

00:26.027 --> 00:27.593
   This is an undiscovered
         structure.

00:29.797 --> 00:32.931
NARRATOR: There is an island
    in the North Atlantic

00:33.034 --> 00:35.801
where people have been looking
   for an incredible treasure

00:35.903 --> 00:38.737
     for more than 200 years.

00:38.839 --> 00:42.641
           So far,
they have found a stone slab

00:42.743 --> 00:45.077
     with strange symbols
       carved into it,

00:45.179 --> 00:47.980
     mysterious fragments
        of human bone,

00:48.082 --> 00:50.582
  and a lead cross whose origin

00:50.684 --> 00:54.353
may stretch back to the days
   of the Knights Templar.

00:54.455 --> 00:58.724
  To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

00:58.826 --> 01:01.760
    And, according to legend,

01:01.862 --> 01:04.696
    one more will have to die

01:04.799 --> 01:08.367
      before the treasure
         can be found.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.580
     It is the beginning
    of an exciting new day

01:21.682 --> 01:23.015
          on Oak Island,

01:23.117 --> 01:25.150
         as brothers
    Rick and Marty Lagina,

01:25.252 --> 01:27.553
       along with members
   of the Oak Island team...

01:27.655 --> 01:29.488
  All right, turn the pump off.

01:29.590 --> 01:34.059
   ...continue their massive
  excavation of Smith's Cove.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.662
             LAIRD:
 We got something here, Charles.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.564
            -Huh?
   -We got something here.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.866
           CHARLES:
What? Is that another upright?

01:40.968 --> 01:42.301
        -LAIRD: Yeah.
    -JACK: Is it numbered
        on this log?

01:42.403 --> 01:43.602
          CHARLES:
     Well, it should be.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.104
       If that's the case,

01:45.206 --> 01:46.371
    then there should be
 a number in here somewhere.

01:46.474 --> 01:48.307
      Try in there, Laird.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.542
       NARRATOR: As part
   of their effort to locate

01:50.644 --> 01:53.078
          and turn off
an ancient flood tunnel system

01:53.180 --> 01:57.082
believed to channel seawater
   deep into the Money Pit,

01:57.184 --> 02:01.920
     the team has constructed
a 525-foot-long steel cofferdam

02:02.022 --> 02:05.657
      completely surrounding
the cove, allowing for the area

02:05.759 --> 02:08.393
      to be fully drained
       and then excavated

02:08.496 --> 02:10.529
     to a depth of ten feet.

02:10.631 --> 02:14.733
That should be the corner of the
U-shaped structure, right there.

02:15.669 --> 02:16.902
       Yeah, of some sort.

02:17.004 --> 02:18.637
          NARRATOR:
          Last week,

02:18.739 --> 02:22.508
while digging on the northwest
     side of the cofferdam,

02:22.610 --> 02:24.977
          Rick, Marty
    and members of the team

02:25.079 --> 02:26.612
  uncovered a large wooden beam

02:26.714 --> 02:29.515
  with the Roman numeral VII
      carved into it...

02:29.617 --> 02:33.252
 RICK: Here's a notch there,
   and a line and a line.

02:33.354 --> 02:34.887
             JACK:
           Oh, wow!

02:34.989 --> 02:37.122
 NARRATOR: ...a wooden beam
    they believe is a part

02:37.224 --> 02:38.757
       of the so-called
      U-shaped structure

02:38.859 --> 02:41.693
first discovered by Oak Island
        treasure hunter

02:41.795 --> 02:45.364
     Dan Blankenship in 1971.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.299
    Now it is the team's hope

02:47.401 --> 02:49.601
    that by fully exposing
        the structure,

02:49.703 --> 02:51.303
   and deciphering its purpose,

02:51.405 --> 02:53.038
         it may provide
    a critical breakthrough

02:53.140 --> 02:58.377
           in solving
    a 223-year-old mystery.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.379
    CHARLES: Yeah, I got
 a Roman numeral right here!

03:00.481 --> 03:01.613
        -Nice, Charles!
   -TERRY: What do you got?

03:01.715 --> 03:03.916
  X-I. I got eleven right here.

03:06.620 --> 03:10.756
    So there should be one
        right in here.

03:15.162 --> 03:16.995
              Yep.

03:17.097 --> 03:19.731
  -X-I-I right here. Twelve.
      -LAIRD: Excellent.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.200
 RICK: Oh, it's a great find.
          Absolutely.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.334
          CHARLES:
         Hey, Craig.

03:22.436 --> 03:25.671
       I got XII here. XI.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.006
    So if this is eleven,
        that's twelve

03:28.108 --> 03:29.975
     and Laird should be
       on number ten.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.944
           All right.

03:32.046 --> 03:34.513
MARTY: It's extremely gratifying
that as this U-shaped structure

03:34.615 --> 03:37.316
    is gradually uncovered,
the things that we know about

03:37.418 --> 03:39.618
are showing up. We're finding
     the Roman numerals.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.621
  We're finding the spaced,
      hand-cut uprights

03:42.723 --> 03:44.590
  depicted in the old pictures.

03:44.692 --> 03:46.158
  So everything's coming in
         just right.

03:46.260 --> 03:49.161
        On Oak Island,
when you can confirm old data,

03:49.263 --> 03:50.762
        it's a great day.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.165
            TERRY:
  But it seems to be packed,

03:53.267 --> 03:55.467
   with till, clay-rich till.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.069
       And it didn't,
    it didn't just happen

03:57.171 --> 04:00.472
   down around all of these
     natural beach sands.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.208
 It was put here. So, again,
   part of the structure.

04:03.310 --> 04:05.010
    This is really vibrant
          blue clay.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.345
    Yeah, this reminds me
       of what you see

04:06.447 --> 04:07.813
    up towards the Money Pit.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.048
           -Mm-hmm.
   -Anywhere above 50 feet,
          you can get

04:10.150 --> 04:13.418
      a very, very blue
 to purplish clay-rich till.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.053
   So maybe they dug it out
      from the Money Pit

04:15.155 --> 04:16.654
    -and put it down here.
             -Yes.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.656
           NARRATOR:
           Blue clay

04:18.759 --> 04:23.328
   from the Money Pit, found
inside the U-shaped structure?

04:23.430 --> 04:28.033
      In 1804, as members
     of the Onslow Company

04:28.135 --> 04:29.835
    excavated the original
          Money Pit,

04:29.937 --> 04:32.938
   they uncovered platforms
      made of oak logs,

04:33.040 --> 04:35.173
      spaced every ten feet.

04:35.276 --> 04:38.710
      At a depth of 40 feet,
they were intrigued to discover

04:38.812 --> 04:43.782
   a packed layer of blue clay
covering the next oak platform.

04:43.884 --> 04:46.385
      Could the presence
   of blue clay be evidence

04:46.487 --> 04:49.755
that the U-shaped structure
was built by the same people

04:49.857 --> 04:52.190
  involved in the Money Pit's
  construction centuries ago?

04:52.293 --> 04:56.295
    And if so, could it also
   provide an important clue

04:56.397 --> 05:00.632
   in determining the purpose
of this mysterious structure?

05:00.734 --> 05:04.703
     What looks very clear
is that the outside, for sure,

05:04.805 --> 05:06.672
       of the structure,
     what we can examine,

05:06.774 --> 05:09.875
 that clay was packed against it
         intentionally.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.644
     Looks for all the world
 like intentional waterproofing,

05:12.746 --> 05:15.781
            -to me.
       -I would concur.

05:15.883 --> 05:19.785
             RICK:
      That is a big log.

05:19.887 --> 05:23.522
-It continues to go that way.
        -TERRY: Yep.

05:23.624 --> 05:27.225
So what Billy needs to do is put
it right here and dig that back.

05:27.328 --> 05:28.560
            TERRY:
             Yeah.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.128
      And then we'll get
     a good understanding

05:30.230 --> 05:32.531
      of how far that goes.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.607
            RICK:
 Amazing. Quite a structure.

05:42.710 --> 05:43.942
          -JACK: Yeah.
-There's no question about that,

05:44.044 --> 05:47.179
   but what was it, or is it?

05:47.281 --> 05:48.814
            GARY:
            Yep.

05:48.916 --> 05:51.717
  The whole purpose of this
    program, if you will,

05:51.819 --> 05:55.120
     has been to expose
   the U-shaped structure.

05:55.222 --> 05:58.690
      There's something just
significantly strange about it.

05:58.792 --> 06:02.160
  And so to once and for all
       put that to bed:

06:02.262 --> 06:03.895
    "What is this structure?"

06:03.997 --> 06:07.032
        "Who built it,
   for what purpose, when?"

06:07.134 --> 06:09.234
   Those are the questions
     we hope to answer.

06:09.336 --> 06:12.304
Do you want me to get in there
   and have a metal detect?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.540
          Coming down.

06:15.642 --> 06:17.509
    TERRY: Okay, we'll get
 to the end here in a second.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.644
       The very end of it.

06:22.950 --> 06:25.884
             GARY:
     Coming around, Rick.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.057
   I'm not getting any metal.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.792
      -CHARLES: Nothing?
             -No.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.161
    Not even in the loose
        sandy areas.

06:36.263 --> 06:39.631
       I'm not getting
    any metal whatsoever.

06:39.733 --> 06:43.001
              RICK:
Another thing that's curious is,

06:43.103 --> 06:44.936
 why no nails if it was somewhat

06:45.038 --> 06:47.038
   -of a modern construct?
           -Yeah.
           -Yeah.

06:47.141 --> 06:48.440
          Why no nails?

06:48.542 --> 06:51.243
         -GARY: Yeah.
            -Right?

06:51.345 --> 06:53.345
 RICK: We don't see any evidence
   of spikes in these timbers.

06:53.447 --> 06:56.882
   Obviously, they were notched

06:56.984 --> 06:59.718
        and timbered
    and doweled in place.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.087
  So that holds great promise
      for the possibility

07:02.189 --> 07:05.257
      that this is very old.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.861
Okay, here's the end right here.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.797
        Is this the end?

07:11.899 --> 07:13.632
         That's the end.

07:13.734 --> 07:16.368
Wait, so have we uncovered all
of the U-shaped structure now?

07:16.470 --> 07:18.837
         As we know it,

07:18.939 --> 07:21.606
       but we don't have
    an explanation for it.

07:21.708 --> 07:24.643
    MARTY: Well, here's the
question: who first identified

07:24.745 --> 07:27.078
  the so-called finger drains?

07:27.181 --> 07:28.613
That would be the Truro Company.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.751
          NARRATOR:
           In 1850,

07:32.853 --> 07:34.753
while searching for the source
       of the ocean water

07:34.855 --> 07:36.354
     flooding the Money Pit,

07:36.457 --> 07:39.224
       treasure hunters
    from the Truro Company

07:39.326 --> 07:43.295
    discovered five man-made
  box drains at Smith's Cove.

07:43.397 --> 07:47.199
  Made using two rows of rock
   spaced eight inches apart,

07:47.301 --> 07:49.334
     and with flat stones
         on the top,

07:49.436 --> 07:52.537
   they appeared to converge
      into a single tunnel

07:52.639 --> 07:57.309
   heading directly towards
  the fabled treasure shaft.

07:57.411 --> 07:59.544
     Would they have been
      within the boundary

07:59.646 --> 08:01.279
 -of this U-shaped structure?
             -Yes.

08:01.381 --> 08:02.914
    Yes. Okay, well, then,
       that makes sense

08:03.016 --> 08:05.517
  that searchers were trying
         to dam it up.

08:05.619 --> 08:08.620
    But why no record of it?

08:08.722 --> 08:11.289
      How do we know
  that this is searchers?

08:13.393 --> 08:14.926
     I mean, it could be
      original people.

08:15.028 --> 08:18.964
    This is probably the base
 of something, like a cofferdam.

08:19.066 --> 08:20.799
   And then if they put it
   in place, it would have

08:20.901 --> 08:23.535
     allowed them to build
   the flood tunnel system.

08:23.637 --> 08:26.571
        -Yes, correct.
            -JACK:
  'Cause the original people

08:26.673 --> 08:28.673
       would have had
  some sort of a cofferdam,

08:28.775 --> 08:31.977
you know, to block off the water
while they built the booby trap.

08:32.078 --> 08:34.546
      -Would have had to.
-No question about that, Jack.

08:34.648 --> 08:37.015
          NARRATOR:
Could the U-shaped structure

08:37.116 --> 08:39.717
        be the remains
   of an ancient cofferdam?

08:39.820 --> 08:41.986
       One used during
       the construction

08:42.089 --> 08:45.290
of an elaborate flood tunnel
   system at Smith's Cove?

08:45.392 --> 08:48.994
And, if so, could it mean the
  team is close to discovering

08:49.096 --> 08:54.165
the entrance to the legendary
       stone box drains?

08:54.268 --> 08:57.102
     If this is a cofferdam,
 then it's containing something.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.971
         Okay, so this--
this material has to be removed.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.773
      -Between the arms?
            -Yeah.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.775
   -I like the sound of that.
-Okay, well, let's get after it.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.176
         Start digging.

09:05.279 --> 09:08.280
            MARTY:
    Let's get some results.

09:09.816 --> 09:12.183
This could be the 90 Foot Stone.

09:12.286 --> 09:14.319
 RYAN: Definitely intentional
     carving of a letter.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.887
             JACK:
    Do you see what I see?

09:15.989 --> 09:17.355
     -TONY: Oh, my God.
    -JACK: We're dead on.

09:17.457 --> 09:19.891
  GARY: The star map theory
      could be correct.

09:25.632 --> 09:27.966
          NARRATOR:
    One day after exposing

09:28.068 --> 09:30.168
the entire U-shaped structure
       at Smith's Cove...

09:30.270 --> 09:32.003
  -Hey, Laird. Good morning.
      -LAIRD: Hey, Marty.

09:32.105 --> 09:35.040
  ...Marty Lagina meets with
   archeologist Laird Niven

09:35.142 --> 09:36.508
to continue their investigation

09:36.610 --> 09:39.444
         of the unusual
       wooden formation.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.680
    MARTY: So, look, I know
  you're anxious to get data

09:41.782 --> 09:43.982
       -on this, right?
     Get it all recorded?
       -Yes, absolutely.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.283
   -Yeah, so, let's measure
        this thing up.
            -Okay.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.485
 We'll start with the south end,
            I guess.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.354
 -That end over there? Okay.
           -Yeah.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.590
  NARRATOR: Before the team
      begins excavating

09:51.692 --> 09:53.525
  inside the U-shaped structure,

09:53.627 --> 09:57.462
  Marty and Laird will record
  its exact size and position

09:57.564 --> 09:59.397
          in the hopes
     that this information

09:59.499 --> 10:01.333
  could offer an important clue

10:01.435 --> 10:04.135
       as to who built it
   and what it was used for.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.704
  I don't know what you want
       archaeologically,

10:05.806 --> 10:09.608
     but I kind of want
almost projected to projected

10:09.710 --> 10:11.376
 the inside to inside dimension,

10:11.478 --> 10:12.711
 'cause that's what they were
      trying to enclose.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.512
           LAIRD:
      Yeah, absolutely.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.081
   MARTY: Whenever you do
   an experiment like this,

10:16.183 --> 10:17.582
      something may happen,

10:17.684 --> 10:18.850
  some data may come out of it

10:18.952 --> 10:20.752
       that you weren't
      even anticipating,

10:20.854 --> 10:22.520
    so it's-it's worth doing.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.957
           LAIRD:
 Now we'll do this east arm.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.626
MARTY: All the way to the end
      of the other one?

10:27.728 --> 10:28.793
        -LAIRD: Yeah.
           -Okay.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.631
     LAIRD: That's good.
  Just down a little lower.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.299
    (vehicle breaks whining)

10:35.268 --> 10:36.201
            Perfect.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.103
           What is it?

10:38.205 --> 10:41.339
              65.5.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.608
    Well, I'm sure there's
     some meaning in that.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.343
              Yeah.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.146
     MARTY: You never seen
  anything like this before?

10:48.248 --> 10:50.482
            LAIRD:
 No. No, it's pretty massive.

10:50.584 --> 10:52.884
 It's a massive undertaking--
    even if it's searchers,

10:52.986 --> 10:54.386
 -it's a massive undertaking.
        -Oh, uh, yeah.

10:54.488 --> 10:56.321
   They must've had to have...

10:56.423 --> 10:58.757
I mean, 'cause we, we would've
   been below sea level here

10:58.859 --> 11:00.692
     at... even at low tide,

11:00.794 --> 11:02.627
       -300 years ago.
           -Yeah.

11:02.729 --> 11:04.963
    But how do you start
   at two feet underwater?

11:05.065 --> 11:07.198
 -I don't know. I don't know.
     -I mean, these things
         would float.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.633
          -(chuckles)
        -I don't know.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.268
     So we have no evidence

11:10.370 --> 11:12.537
    -of anchoring at all.
           -Right.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.172
      So they would rely
     on the weight above.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.740
           -Yeah.
          -Somehow.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.543
    Maybe that is it, because
 if these were pegged already...

11:18.645 --> 11:19.944
      No, and the pegs
      go right through.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.746
        They go right--
   come out the other side.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.415
            MARTY:
             Wow.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.183
-So, yeah, that's a massive peg.
             -Yeah.

11:25.285 --> 11:28.286
MARTY: We've got the U-shaped
      structure exposed.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.955
  Laird wasn't sure what it was.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.892
   He'd never seen anything
       like that before.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.828
  It could be archeologically
          significant.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.065
     All right, what else
   do you need? Is that it?

11:40.167 --> 11:42.067
      I think that's it.
 We should go start the pump.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.935
         -Get to work.
     -Let's go, let's go.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.938
 NARRATOR: While Marty and Laird
        begin preparations

11:47.040 --> 11:49.340
         to dig inside
    the U-shaped structure,

11:49.443 --> 11:53.845
Rick Lagina, Craig Tester and
members of the Oak Island team

11:53.947 --> 11:55.814
     gather in the war room.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.383
       Well, gentlemen,
       today we welcome

11:58.485 --> 12:00.151
  Rob and Ryan to the war room.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.654
   NARRATOR: Joining them
        are Rob Hyslop

12:02.756 --> 12:05.724
      and Ryan Levangie
  of Azimuth Consulting, LTD

12:05.826 --> 12:08.326
        who have come
to present their findings on

12:08.428 --> 12:11.896
what could be the team's most
  important discovery to date.

12:11.998 --> 12:14.299
 You know, every time we sit
     around this table,

12:14.401 --> 12:16.267
  we're always talking about
     interesting subjects.

12:16.369 --> 12:19.604
But we have in front of us one
of the most mysterious objects

12:19.706 --> 12:20.805
     relating to Oak Island.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.241
This could be the 90 Foot Stone.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.343
              Yeah.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.612
       I think we've got
     something over here.

12:27.714 --> 12:29.280
          NARRATOR:
       Two weeks ago...

12:29.382 --> 12:30.715
   while exploring the basement

12:30.817 --> 12:32.450
      underneath a former
         bookbindery...

12:32.552 --> 12:37.021
Jack Begley, Charles Barkhouse
  and researcher Doug Crowell

12:37.124 --> 12:39.791
      found a large slab
   matching the description

12:39.893 --> 12:43.027
     of one of Oak Island's
  most legendary artifacts...

12:43.130 --> 12:45.630
   the so-called 90 Foot Stone.

12:45.732 --> 12:47.766
              DOUG:
 There's something carved there.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.969
 NARRATOR: First discovered by
members of the Onslow Company

12:51.071 --> 12:54.806
   in 1804 while excavating
    the original Money Pit

12:54.908 --> 12:56.441
     to a depth of 90 feet...

12:56.543 --> 13:00.178
the unusual olive-gray stone
         was reported

13:00.280 --> 13:02.814
     to have been carved with
a number of hieroglyphic shapes

13:02.916 --> 13:05.517
     and markings which,
    when later translated,

13:05.619 --> 13:07.218
      were believed to read,

13:07.320 --> 13:10.455
  "40 feet below, two million
      pounds are buried."

13:12.159 --> 13:14.659
        There's, uh,
   several markings on it.

13:14.761 --> 13:17.395
    But we feel there might
 be things that are obscured.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.330
          NARRATOR:
         Last week...

13:19.432 --> 13:21.266
    in an effort to reveal
    any man-made carvings

13:21.368 --> 13:24.369
believed to have been damaged
   on the artifact's surface,

13:24.471 --> 13:26.638
  the team invited Rob and Ryan

13:26.740 --> 13:28.873
       to the Oak Island
        Research Center

13:28.975 --> 13:31.309
      where they conducted
a three-dimensional laser scan

13:31.411 --> 13:33.945
of the suspected 90 Foot Stone.

13:36.683 --> 13:39.784
RICK: Rob and Ryan, they've done
     the scan of the stone.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.886
   And, uh, they'll tell us
        whether or not

13:41.988 --> 13:44.155
   there are carvings on here.

13:44.257 --> 13:47.091
    So, to that end, Rob,
        enlighten us.

13:47.194 --> 13:48.693
             ROB:
          Certainly.

13:48.795 --> 13:50.795
 So, from our initial analysis,

13:50.897 --> 13:52.764
     the stone was used
  as something in the past.

13:52.866 --> 13:55.200
 and it has caused certain areas
     to wear off completely.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.435
     So, traditionally,
    we look at a 3D model

13:57.537 --> 13:59.537
    from a perspective view.

13:59.639 --> 14:02.173
    We're just gonna focus
  on the top view right now,

14:02.275 --> 14:04.309
    that's where the most
interesting descriptions are.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.979
       So, looking at
     this overview here,

14:08.949 --> 14:11.249
      We've got this "LN."

14:11.351 --> 14:14.018
   And this has definitely
      been carved out.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.253
              Damn.

14:16.623 --> 14:19.991
 ROB: Now, if we r-rotate it
       180 degrees...

14:20.093 --> 14:21.626
       now you can see...

14:24.431 --> 14:26.531
...we've got a well-defined "A."

14:28.201 --> 14:31.202
 Those are definitely letters
   inscribed into the stone.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.137
   DOUG: That's interesting
  because we didn't see any,

14:33.240 --> 14:35.707
    -any sign on the "A."
          -Mm-hmm.

14:35.809 --> 14:37.842
      It is very faint;
      so whether or not

14:37.944 --> 14:40.545
  that's an "A" from looking
      at it upside down,

14:40.647 --> 14:43.147
 or an N the other way around...

14:43.250 --> 14:45.450
    definitely intentional
     carving of a letter.

14:45.552 --> 14:47.585
      Now, keep in mind,
       Captain Bowdoin,

14:47.687 --> 14:49.554
    who was an eyewitness
        to the stone,

14:49.656 --> 14:52.123
one of the last eyewitnesses,
 he just said two initials.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.291
             Mm-hmm.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.462
           NARRATOR:
    According to reports...

14:57.564 --> 14:59.230
   the 90 Foot Stone was taken

14:59.332 --> 15:02.667
  to the city of Halifax in 1865

15:02.769 --> 15:04.936
  where it was put on display
         in the window

15:05.038 --> 15:07.171
       of the Creighton
   and Marshall's bookstore

15:07.274 --> 15:08.773
  in an attempt to raise capital

15:08.875 --> 15:11.009
      for the Oak Island
        treasure hunt.

15:11.111 --> 15:15.780
  Upon hearing of the stone's
      whereabouts in 1909,

15:15.882 --> 15:17.682
       treasure hunter
   Captain Henry L. Bowdoin

15:17.784 --> 15:19.684
       visited the store
          in the hopes

15:19.786 --> 15:22.086
   that by seeing the stone
         for himself,

15:22.188 --> 15:24.055
  he might be able to find clues

15:24.157 --> 15:26.057
  missed by previous searchers.

15:26.159 --> 15:30.561
However, he was disappointed to
find that the stone had spent

15:30.664 --> 15:32.830
years being used as a surface
          for cutting

15:32.933 --> 15:35.400
      and beating leather
          bookbinding.

15:35.502 --> 15:38.970
  And all that remained of the
stone's legendary inscription

15:39.072 --> 15:43.041
  were what Bowdoin described
   to be two carved initials.

15:44.911 --> 15:47.745
  Could the letters the laser
   scanning has just revealed

15:47.847 --> 15:51.449
be proof that this is the same
   stone Captain Bowdoin saw

15:51.551 --> 15:53.284
       over a century ago?

15:53.386 --> 15:57.155
Proof that the Oak Island team
      has, in fact, found

15:57.257 --> 15:59.390
        the 90 Foot Stone?

15:59.492 --> 16:03.494
   And, if so, could further
scientific testing help reveal

16:03.596 --> 16:08.199
what else may have once been
    carved on its surface?

16:09.903 --> 16:13.371
RICK: So this is what you see,
       and nothing more?

16:13.473 --> 16:16.240
 No, we don't see any linear
     features that would

16:16.343 --> 16:19.811
     indicate characters,
  other than those initials.

16:19.913 --> 16:22.613
 We've reached the limit of what
      lidar is capable of.

16:22.716 --> 16:24.182
      We'll have to look
       at other methods

16:24.284 --> 16:25.483
    to bring out more detail.

16:27.721 --> 16:30.722
It has to have an inscription
on it to be the original stone.

16:30.824 --> 16:33.257
So we're going to do some more
testing to see if it once did.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.926
RICK: There's still some more
       work to be done

16:35.028 --> 16:36.561
      as far as analysis
        is concerned,

16:36.663 --> 16:38.463
   so there's still some hope,

16:38.565 --> 16:41.366
and we need to follow that path.

16:41.468 --> 16:44.635
 -To me, I think this is the
   stone that Bowdoin saw.
            -Yep.

16:44.738 --> 16:47.071
       Without a doubt,
      this is the stone.

16:47.173 --> 16:50.008
So, it's been a very interesting
morning, thanks to Rob and Ryan.

16:50.110 --> 16:53.177
        -Our pleasure.
    -Thanks for having us.

16:53.279 --> 16:55.146
    The door isn't closed
    on the 90 Foot Stone.

16:55.248 --> 16:56.514
           Absolutely.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.383
     So the hunt continues.

16:58.485 --> 17:01.452
    -PAUL: Yes, it does.
     -CRAIG: Absolutely.

17:02.922 --> 17:04.756
             GARY:
  Oh, look at that one there.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.557
 -TONY: That's a better hit.
     -GARY: That's good.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.326
            JACK:
         Oh, my God.

17:08.428 --> 17:09.794
          BRENNAN:
    Hold the phone, boys!

17:09.896 --> 17:12.096
        Hold the phone.
      The plot thickens.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.669
RTY: Maybe take this
all the way back to the end.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.104
           NARRATOR:
        As Marty Lagina

17:20.205 --> 17:22.040
    and members of the team
            continue

17:22.142 --> 17:25.943
  to dig within the U-shaped
structure at Smith's Cove...

17:27.814 --> 17:30.515
      ...Rick Lagina, Dave
Blankenship, Charles Barkhouse

17:30.617 --> 17:34.018
    and Doug Crowell head
    to the Money Pit site.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.853
      If this is a tunnel,

17:35.955 --> 17:38.456
       and we confirm it
    with today's drilling,

17:38.558 --> 17:40.191
 the first thing I want to do
        is run a tape.

17:40.293 --> 17:41.692
     Where's the Money Pit?

17:41.795 --> 17:44.128
  NARRATOR: They are eager
     to continue progress

17:44.230 --> 17:46.697
    of their core drilling
    operation in search of

17:46.800 --> 17:48.466
       a centuries-old
       searcher tunnel,

17:48.568 --> 17:50.635
    which they believe will
       lead them directly

17:50.737 --> 17:53.237
  to the original Oak Island
       treasure shaft.

17:53.339 --> 17:54.806
     We do have some data
         to work with,

17:54.908 --> 17:56.741
  and we can confirm a tunnel.

17:56.843 --> 18:00.478
We know that Shaft Six has to
be at the end of that tunnel.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.081
      -Then we might be
       onto something.
           -Yeah.

18:03.183 --> 18:07.485
NARRATOR: In 1861, a group of
  treasure hunters attempted

18:07.587 --> 18:09.754
    to reach the bottom of
    the original Money Pit

18:09.856 --> 18:14.092
by digging an adjacent shaft,
   later known as Shaft Six,

18:14.194 --> 18:17.829
        some 18 feet west.

18:17.931 --> 18:20.298
     At a depth of 118 feet,

18:20.400 --> 18:23.067
     they began to tunnel
     underneath the pit,

18:23.169 --> 18:26.104
in the hopes of circumventing
    the fabled booby traps,

18:26.206 --> 18:30.007
   allowing them to retrieve
    the treasure from below.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.310
Unfortunately, just inches away

18:32.412 --> 18:34.545
        from breaching
      the chamber floor,

18:34.647 --> 18:36.848
   the tunnel began flooding
         with seawater,

18:36.950 --> 18:39.283
         forcing a halt
       to their efforts.

18:40.987 --> 18:43.955
  Shortly afterward, a series
     of thunderous crashes

18:44.057 --> 18:45.623
     were heard underground,

18:45.725 --> 18:48.793
  indicating that the wooden
     beams of Shaft Six,

18:48.895 --> 18:51.562
    along with the cribbing
     inside the Money Pit,

18:51.664 --> 18:54.132
        had collapsed,
  scattering tons of lumber,

18:54.234 --> 18:56.934
    and possibly treasure,
        across a deep,

18:57.036 --> 18:59.070
     underwater debris field.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.074
       Uh-oh, that's wood.

19:03.176 --> 19:05.343
 That's the edge of your timber.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.578
           NARRATOR:
        Four weeks ago,

19:07.680 --> 19:10.381
         while drilling
    at a depth of 109 feet,

19:10.483 --> 19:13.484
the Oak Island team discovered
   evidence of wood timbers,

19:13.586 --> 19:17.722
which they believed to be part
    of the Shaft Six tunnel,

19:17.824 --> 19:21.459
whose location has been lost
     for over 100 years.

19:21.561 --> 19:24.729
      If it is Shaft Six,
    it's been long sought.

19:24.831 --> 19:28.232
NARRATOR: Since then, the team
      has drilled two more

19:28.334 --> 19:30.635
     exploratory boreholes
      targeting the shaft,

19:30.737 --> 19:32.436
  in the hopes of pinpointing
          the tunnel's

19:32.539 --> 19:34.705
   exact position underground.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.340
            TERRY:
   There's a piece of wood.

19:36.442 --> 19:38.910
We must have clipped the edge,
  just the edge of a tunnel.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.412
      Six. That's it. Six.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.582
            RICK:
       There's Brennan.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.951
  Mike and Adam are on the rig.

19:50.056 --> 19:52.456
      -RICK: Let's see
      how far they are.
         -DOUG: Yes.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.492
 NARRATOR: Working with the team
      from Choice Drilling,

19:54.594 --> 19:59.230
    it is Rick Lagina's hope
that their fourth hole, K-5.5,

19:59.332 --> 20:02.600
      will also intersect
the long-lost searcher tunnel,

20:02.702 --> 20:04.702
allowing them to accurately map
          the direction

20:04.804 --> 20:06.470
    of the original Money Pit

20:06.573 --> 20:08.272
        and possibly find

20:08.374 --> 20:10.875
    a massive debris field
         of treasure.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.110
     -Good morning, guys.
     -RICK: Good morning.
         How are you?

20:13.213 --> 20:15.079
            -Good.
        -Hey, Brennan.

20:15.181 --> 20:16.514
     Okay, so where are we?

20:16.616 --> 20:18.649
     We are at 68 right now.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.451
  Just came out of the ground.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.988
  NARRATOR: Using a process
   known as sonic drilling,

20:24.090 --> 20:26.157
        which employs
    a high-frequency sound

20:26.259 --> 20:29.227
  to pulverize through earth
     and other obstacles,

20:29.329 --> 20:32.263
  a specialized coring barrel
      will extract samples

20:32.365 --> 20:34.865
in intervals of up to ten feet.

20:34.968 --> 20:38.769
These core samples will then be
     carefully sifted by hand

20:38.871 --> 20:41.105
     for not only evidence
         of the tunnel,

20:41.207 --> 20:44.141
    but also any artifacts
     or possible treasure

20:44.244 --> 20:46.043
       they might contain.

20:46.145 --> 20:49.947
 DOUG: As long as we get into
 in situ material before 104.

20:50.049 --> 20:52.049
       We're a ways away.

20:52.151 --> 20:54.785
          NARRATOR:
   While drilling continues

20:54.887 --> 20:56.921
      at the Money Pit site,

20:57.023 --> 21:00.024
Jack Begley and metal detection
       expert Gary Drayton

21:00.126 --> 21:03.561
  are meeting with local diver
and boat captain Tony Sampson

21:03.663 --> 21:05.863
   at the marina just across
    the bay from Oak Island.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.832
           Hey, Tony.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.567
            TONY:
  Hey, how you doing, guys?

21:09.669 --> 21:11.035
           -Good.
        -Hello, mate.
      -Good to see you.

21:11.137 --> 21:12.970
  And you, mate. How you doing?

21:13.072 --> 21:15.139
     TONY: Good, buddy.
  Good to see you, brother.

21:15.241 --> 21:16.374
   Where are we off to, guys?

21:16.476 --> 21:18.009
             JACK:
   Well, we have a theorist

21:18.111 --> 21:20.444
  that came in just recently
      and he has a theory

21:20.546 --> 21:24.715
 that the stars actually map out
         on Oak Island.

21:24.817 --> 21:27.718
 But one of his points lands
  directly on Apple Island.

21:27.820 --> 21:28.686
              Okay.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.155
            TRAVIS:
         What we have

21:31.257 --> 21:34.425
    are all of the stars
  aligning onto the island.

21:34.527 --> 21:37.028
           NARRATOR:
Two weeks ago, astrophysicist

21:37.130 --> 21:40.398
    and aerospace engineer
      Dr. Travis Taylor

21:40.500 --> 21:42.967
      presented the team
  with an incredible theory.

21:43.069 --> 21:47.071
A theory which shed new light
         on connections

21:47.173 --> 21:49.340
between the Oak Island mystery
   and the ancient fraternity

21:49.442 --> 21:52.410
      of builders known
      as the Freemasons.

21:52.512 --> 21:54.812
 TRAVIS: One of the first things
      that jumped out at me

21:54.914 --> 21:57.581
      was Hiram Abiff's
 Freemason drawing template.

21:57.684 --> 21:59.517
  There are actually meanings
          on this map

21:59.619 --> 22:01.319
   that are based on astronomy.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.921
   NARRATOR: After studying
the so-called drawing template

22:04.023 --> 22:06.324
     of Hiram Abiff, who,
  according to the teachings

22:06.426 --> 22:08.826
        of Freemasonry,
    was the chief architect

22:08.928 --> 22:10.895
    of King Solomon's Temple,

22:10.997 --> 22:13.798
Travis observed secret symbols
           and images

22:13.900 --> 22:16.367
representing a hidden star map.

22:16.469 --> 22:19.136
     One that he believes
      actually connects

22:19.238 --> 22:22.239
   the constellation Taurus
to points across Oak Island,

22:22.342 --> 22:26.444
as well as to the neighboring
    Frog and Apple Islands.

22:26.546 --> 22:29.213
TRAVIS: If we follow the right
  procedure, we might be led

22:29.315 --> 22:33.751
 to the point on Oak Island
where the actual treasure is.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.387
           NARRATOR:
Using the star map as a guide,

22:36.489 --> 22:39.590
       Travis led the team
to various points on the island

22:39.692 --> 22:42.993
where they identified a number
   of possible stone markers.

22:43.096 --> 22:46.430
  Is that not a giant stone,
         right there?

22:46.532 --> 22:47.832
            JACK:
 It's amazing that we've run

22:47.934 --> 22:50.434
into big boulders at each point.

22:50.536 --> 22:53.170
           NARRATOR:
Now, after securing permission

22:53.272 --> 22:54.672
      to visit Apple Island,

22:54.774 --> 22:57.575
located just a half mile east
         of Oak Island,

22:57.677 --> 23:00.511
    Jack and Gary are eager
  to search the two-acre area

23:00.613 --> 23:02.780
   for any important markers
            or clues

23:02.882 --> 23:06.650
          connected
to Travis Taylor's star map.

23:06.753 --> 23:08.886
   JACK: I'm kind of giddy
     with anticipation.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.188
    I have a good feeling
        about today.

23:11.290 --> 23:12.823
 -We're gonna find something.
        -GARY: Oh yeah.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.425
            JACK:
And I hope you find something

23:14.527 --> 23:16.360
  with your detector, too,
so that we can get permission

23:16.462 --> 23:18.829
    to come back and dig it.

23:18.931 --> 23:21.799
It's gonna be interesting to see
   what kind of targets I get.

23:21.901 --> 23:26.103
I just think that this is, like,
 a stepping stone to the island.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.272
That's what it looks like to me.

23:28.374 --> 23:30.474
  Okay, that looks good, guys.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.810
   -I'll drop anchor here.
         -All right.

23:35.615 --> 23:37.181
  JACK: What I really like
     about Travis's theory

23:37.283 --> 23:39.383
 is that he has hard targets
     for us to explore.

23:39.485 --> 23:42.286
   And whenever we can take
   a theory into the field,

23:42.388 --> 23:43.921
   that's really good for us.

23:44.023 --> 23:45.890
       After you, brother.

23:45.992 --> 23:47.691
   JACK: Where do you think
       we should start?

23:47.794 --> 23:49.794
 Well, that last time I came up,
  Gary, the northern side here

23:49.896 --> 23:51.562
    -was the easiest way.
           -Yeah.

23:51.664 --> 23:54.665
          NARRATOR:
Although Gary, Tony and Jack

23:54.767 --> 23:57.568
      are hopeful to make
    an important discovery,

23:57.670 --> 23:59.537
they are not the first members
     of the Oak Island team

23:59.639 --> 24:02.106
   to explore on Apple Island.

24:02.208 --> 24:06.177
     In 1994, Dan Blankenship

24:06.279 --> 24:08.813
     formed the Mahone Bay
      Exploration Company

24:08.915 --> 24:12.216
      and secured permits
    to search Apple Island,

24:12.318 --> 24:14.618
  along with several others,
        for any clues

24:14.720 --> 24:17.521
   that might help him solve
    the Oak Island mystery.

24:17.623 --> 24:20.624
        Unfortunately,
     Dan's investigations

24:20.726 --> 24:23.727
        of the islands
      were inconclusive.

24:23.830 --> 24:27.565
However, he was not armed with
the metal detection equipment

24:27.667 --> 24:30.801
   that the Oak Island team
          has today.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.404
      JACK: All right,
   let me look at the map.

24:33.506 --> 24:36.674
   All right. So I have GPS
    pulled up on my phone,

24:36.776 --> 24:40.077
in comparison to where Travis
    marked it on his map.

24:40.179 --> 24:42.046
     It should be that way.

24:42.148 --> 24:46.217
    GARY: Yep, let's see
if we can prove Travis right.

24:46.319 --> 24:49.653
-Yeah. Do you see what I see?
        -Oh, my God.

24:49.755 --> 24:51.222
       -Look at that.
-You're looking for boulders,

24:51.324 --> 24:53.424
      that's a big boulder.

24:58.164 --> 24:59.697
       Whoa! Interesting.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.899
    Laird, take a quick look?

25:03.369 --> 25:04.535
 This is as good as it can get.

25:04.637 --> 25:06.103
           -Yeah.
         -(chuckles)

25:11.310 --> 25:13.244
         -GARY: Ooh.
     -JACK: Oh. No way!

25:13.346 --> 25:15.746
      That's a big boulder.

25:15.848 --> 25:18.315
  NARRATOR: While exploring
       on Apple Island,

25:18.417 --> 25:21.752
   located just a half mile
off the coast of Oak Island,

25:21.854 --> 25:25.189
   Jack Begley, Gary Drayton
        and Tony Sampson

25:25.291 --> 25:28.392
have just made a potentially
    significant discovery.

25:28.494 --> 25:30.995
             GARY:
      This is fantastic.

25:31.097 --> 25:33.130
      Oh, look at these.
        We've got more.

25:33.232 --> 25:35.099
       -TONY: Oh, geez.
   -GARY: I think these two

25:35.201 --> 25:36.967
 -are even bigger than this one.
          -No, I know.
     Look at that one there.

25:37.069 --> 25:38.936
 So there's three in this area.

25:39.038 --> 25:42.473
         -JACK: Yep.
     -Right in the place
  where Travis pointed out.

25:42.575 --> 25:45.576
     NARRATOR: Boulders?
   In nearly the exact spot

25:45.678 --> 25:48.479
          indicated
on Travis Taylor's star map?

25:48.581 --> 25:52.216
Could these boulders contain
any important markings or clues

25:52.318 --> 25:55.953
that could help the team solve
    the Oak Island mystery?

25:56.055 --> 25:57.688
            GARY:
     That is impressive.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.356
            JACK:
            Yeah.

25:59.458 --> 26:02.259
  -This was probably eroded,
          this area.
             -Yup.

26:02.361 --> 26:04.194
  GARY: And these would have
     been sitting higher.

26:04.297 --> 26:06.163
  It would have been a group
       of big boulders.

26:06.265 --> 26:09.099
    -They could have been
  sitting just up above us.
           -Yeah.

26:09.201 --> 26:11.035
-TONY: Should we go and check
    those other two out?
        -GARY: Yeah.

26:11.137 --> 26:14.605
  You notice how two of the
 boulders are white granite,

26:14.707 --> 26:16.874
 -and this one's more of a pink?
   -TONY: He's sort of a reddy
        color, isn't he?

26:16.976 --> 26:18.208
         -GARY: Yeah.
         -JACK: Yeah.

26:18.311 --> 26:21.879
      This whole side's
      been broken off.

26:21.981 --> 26:23.347
 So this was probably bigger
        at one time.

26:23.449 --> 26:25.316
 Yeah, there's a chunk missing.

26:25.418 --> 26:27.418
       These are massive.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.321
    -I mean, these are big
        for Oak Island.
            -Yeah.

26:30.423 --> 26:34.525
 I do believe it's possible that
 Travis Taylor's star map theory

26:34.627 --> 26:35.859
        could be correct.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.461
     The boulders are here.

26:37.563 --> 26:40.698
Apple Island's bearing fruit.
      Forgive the pun.

26:40.800 --> 26:43.300
    -Travis's theory seems
      to be working out.
            -Yeah.

26:43.402 --> 26:46.236
   Do you want to have a look
 around or just start detecting?

26:46.339 --> 26:48.939
 -I'd say go on the interior.
           Let's go.
           -Agreed.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.808
        -TONY: Okay.
 -NARRATOR: Having confirmed

26:50.910 --> 26:54.645
   the existence of possible
stone markers on Apple Island,

26:54.747 --> 26:58.549
   Jack, Gary and Tony have
  decided to search the area

26:58.651 --> 27:01.585
        for any signs
      of human activity.

27:01.687 --> 27:03.053
 -Do you want to start here?
           -Yeah.

27:03.155 --> 27:04.588
   I'm gonna start detecting.

27:04.690 --> 27:06.056
        Fingers crossed.

27:06.158 --> 27:07.958
           NARRATOR:
  Because the two-acre island

27:08.060 --> 27:10.995
         is and always
     has been uninhabited,

27:11.097 --> 27:14.298
any indications of metal that
Gary obtains with his detector

27:14.400 --> 27:19.003
could mean important clues-- or
treasure-- may be buried there.

27:19.105 --> 27:21.238
    Let's see if there's
  any metal on this island.

27:21.340 --> 27:24.508
Unfortunately, since the team's
      treasure trove license

27:24.610 --> 27:27.378
  is limited to Oak Island,
  they will have to petition

27:27.480 --> 27:28.912
     the Canadian government

27:29.015 --> 27:30.681
      before they can dig
     any promising targets

27:30.783 --> 27:33.917
    that they identify today.

27:34.020 --> 27:36.487
            (beeping)

27:36.589 --> 27:38.756
        -Ooh, oh, no.
        -What's that?

27:38.858 --> 27:40.858
              GARY:
Yeah, right under the tree here.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.192
           It's iron.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.762
         -How deep?
   -It's five, six inches.

27:44.864 --> 27:47.665
    -JACK: Oh, and it goes
      over there as well?
-Yeah. There's more iron here.

27:47.767 --> 27:50.567
 Yeah, there's a lot of iron
        around here.

27:50.670 --> 27:53.837
  This is the type of stuff
  you want to be detecting

27:53.939 --> 27:57.374
      when you're looking
    for signs of activity.

27:57.476 --> 27:59.043
 And walking around this island,
      it doesn't look like

27:59.145 --> 28:01.812
         there's been
  any recent human activity.

28:01.914 --> 28:04.581
     -No, nothing at all.
          -GARY: Ooh.

28:04.684 --> 28:07.051
 -JACK: That's a better hit.
     -That sounds good.

28:07.153 --> 28:09.286
     We're lucky we ain't
     got a spade with us,

28:09.388 --> 28:11.188
   'cause I'd be digging this.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.490
      So that's a good--
      so, a lot of iron.

28:13.592 --> 28:17.528
That was a nonferrous target,
   meaning it's not iron.

28:17.630 --> 28:21.732
  It could be-- potentially,
   be a coin or an artifact.

28:21.834 --> 28:24.802
That's good sign, with so many
   targets in the one area.

28:24.904 --> 28:26.603
 JACK: We need to get permission
          to dig here.

28:26.706 --> 28:28.372
            GARY:
            Yep.

28:28.474 --> 28:32.476
Just like on Oak Island, Apple
Island has got a lot of targets,

28:32.578 --> 28:36.046
and that's kind of tough on me,
          because I knew

28:36.148 --> 28:39.783
     I couldn't dig them, but
who knows, maybe in the future,

28:39.885 --> 28:43.320
    we will be allowed back
  and dig those good targets.

28:43.422 --> 28:44.588
  TONY: Well, that weather's
       picking up, guys.

28:44.690 --> 28:46.356
   We better start heading
      back to the boat.

28:46.459 --> 28:48.225
             GARY:
        Okay. Let's go.

28:48.327 --> 28:51.962
NARRATOR: While Gary, Jack and
Tony return to the mainland,

28:52.064 --> 28:54.264
     back at the Money Pit...

28:56.402 --> 28:59.236
  ...Rick Lagina and members
     of the team continue

28:59.338 --> 29:02.806
    to monitor the progress
       of Borehole K-5.5,

29:02.908 --> 29:06.510
a hole they hope will encounter
     the 1861 searcher tunnel

29:06.612 --> 29:10.080
      known as Shaft Six,
       located at a depth

29:10.182 --> 29:13.951
    of approximately 118 feet.

29:14.053 --> 29:16.520
  98 feet right now, gentlemen.

29:16.622 --> 29:18.455
            RICK:
          Yeah. 20,

29:18.557 --> 29:20.090
            20 feet.

29:20.192 --> 29:21.425
       Will tell the tale.

29:21.527 --> 29:24.795
  Yeah. Yeah, let's open it up.

29:24.897 --> 29:27.631
  NARRATOR: If successful,
   it should allow the team

29:27.733 --> 29:29.867
          to pinpoint
    the original Money Pit,

29:29.969 --> 29:32.636
    as well as the location
         of an enormous

29:32.738 --> 29:34.872
    underground debris field.

29:34.974 --> 29:37.508
       A definite change.

29:37.610 --> 29:40.043
     -From the four feet
      of material here?
       -RICK: Mm-hmm.

29:40.146 --> 29:42.379
There's a noticeable difference.

29:42.481 --> 29:44.148
    If you found some wood
       in this location,

29:44.250 --> 29:48.519
  I would say, definitely,
we're in a shaft or a tunnel.

29:48.621 --> 29:50.454
And that is interesting, that
it's happening at the depths

29:50.556 --> 29:52.589
-we were hoping to see a tunnel.
         -CHARLES: Yeah.

29:52.691 --> 29:55.292
      I mean, other than
    having a piece of wood

29:55.394 --> 29:56.927
       capping it all off.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.228
   CHARLES: We're assuming
     that they timbered

29:58.330 --> 29:59.696
       the entire roof.
     They might not have.

29:59.799 --> 30:02.132
      Maybe they just put
  the supports sporadically,

30:02.234 --> 30:05.536
you know, they didn't-- it's not
    a, it's not a solid roof.

30:05.638 --> 30:07.004
          NARRATOR:
   Although the core sample

30:07.106 --> 30:09.773
       has not turned up
     any evidence of wood,

30:09.875 --> 30:12.042
  finding what appears to be
   a highly disturbed layer

30:12.144 --> 30:14.778
     of soil and material
       is an indication

30:14.880 --> 30:17.714
       of human activity
       deep underground.

30:17.817 --> 30:20.884
   It suggests that the team
may now be drilling somewhere

30:20.986 --> 30:24.288
        in the center
   of the Shaft Six tunnel.

30:24.390 --> 30:28.192
 If we don't see some hardscape,

30:28.294 --> 30:30.360
          some evidence
 that you can hold in your hand,

30:30.462 --> 30:32.863
     I guess we'll call it.

30:47.112 --> 30:48.846
          BRENNAN:
    Hold the phone, boys!

30:48.948 --> 30:51.515
              DAVE:
 That looks like wood there now.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.584
          We got wood.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.723
              RICK:
 If this comes up with all wood,

30:59.825 --> 31:03.427
  it's the long sought for,
      long elusive Six.

31:03.529 --> 31:04.728
             Right.

31:09.001 --> 31:10.968
             RICK:
      Well, here you go.

31:14.073 --> 31:16.707
          BRENNAN:
     Well, you got wood.

31:16.809 --> 31:18.809
       Where are we here?

31:18.911 --> 31:23.046
   So this wood's somewhere
     between 118 and 124.

31:23.148 --> 31:24.982
    DAVE: You wanted wood,
       now we got wood.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.884
   It's a little bit deeper
than what it's supposed to be,

31:26.986 --> 31:28.252
        but we got wood.

31:30.890 --> 31:32.756
    Five feet, approximately.

31:32.858 --> 31:34.858
          NARRATOR:
      Five feet of wood?

31:34.960 --> 31:38.262
   Found at the same depth
   as Shaft Six and deeper?

31:38.364 --> 31:40.230
   Could this wood be evidence

31:40.332 --> 31:43.033
      of the Money Pit's
      collapse in 1861?

31:43.135 --> 31:45.435
           And if so...

31:45.537 --> 31:47.971
     has the team located
     not only Shaft Six,

31:48.073 --> 31:51.675
       but also a portion
of the suspected debris field?

31:53.812 --> 31:56.947
   Money Pit collapsed in 1861

31:57.049 --> 31:59.349
  and a whole bunch of wood
    sort of went missing.

31:59.451 --> 32:02.619
 So, one plausible theory is
    we're seeing that...

32:02.721 --> 32:04.554
       collapsed wood
    in the collapse zone.

32:04.657 --> 32:08.458
RICK: Are we on the extreme edge
of the Money Pit? I don't know.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.927
       But at some point...

32:10.029 --> 32:11.194
  you release the hounds, right?

32:11.297 --> 32:12.496
        It's time to dig.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.965
       RICK: I think it
    strongly advocates for

32:15.067 --> 32:19.002
         smaller cans
    at multiple locations.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.604
  This is as good as it'd get.

32:20.706 --> 32:23.674
           -Yeah.
         -(chuckles)

32:23.776 --> 32:25.709
  DOUG: Count this as a win
       today, I think.

32:29.281 --> 32:30.681
            LAIRD:
       It's pretty big.

32:30.783 --> 32:31.782
      TERRY: Pretty big
   and pretty interesting.

32:31.884 --> 32:33.116
   Hold it, now, what's this?

32:33.218 --> 32:34.885
           MARTY:
     This is a new find.

32:34.987 --> 32:37.220
  This is totally undiscovered.

32:42.628 --> 32:45.228
NARRATOR: As a new day begins
        on Oak Island,

32:45.331 --> 32:47.998
          Rick Lagina
    and members of the team

32:48.100 --> 32:50.600
    return to Smith's Cove...

32:50.703 --> 32:52.269
    where they're carefully
     monitoring the spoils

32:52.371 --> 32:54.304
      dredged up from inside

32:54.406 --> 32:57.607
         the mysterious
      U-shaped structure.

32:57.710 --> 32:58.842
    This is probably where
      something the size

32:58.944 --> 33:00.010
    of the cross would come.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.645
          -To here.
            -Yep.

33:01.747 --> 33:03.113
           Or a coin.

33:03.215 --> 33:06.817
            NARRATOR:
As each load of excavated earth

33:06.919 --> 33:09.720
    and material is loaded
into the massive wash plant,

33:09.822 --> 33:12.022
       they are funneled
     through a metal grate

33:12.124 --> 33:14.257
   also known as "grizzly bars"

33:14.360 --> 33:17.694
which filters out larger rocks
       and other debris.

33:17.796 --> 33:19.997
  The spoils are then deposited

33:20.099 --> 33:22.199
      onto two individual
          shaker decks

33:22.301 --> 33:25.836
       which separate out
  any hidden objects by size,

33:25.938 --> 33:28.238
       literally shaking
         the soil loose

33:28.340 --> 33:29.806
       and washing it away

33:29.908 --> 33:32.876
         using a series
    of fixed spray nozzles.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.680
     The resulting piles
    will then be carefully

33:36.782 --> 33:38.582
       searched by hand...

33:38.684 --> 33:40.384
       as well as scanned
     with a metal detector

33:40.486 --> 33:44.287
  for any important artifacts
     or possible treasure.

33:44.390 --> 33:45.455
             Randy!

33:45.557 --> 33:48.158
 Is there a way to turn it down?

33:48.260 --> 33:51.094
            JACK:
      What is it, Gary?

33:51.196 --> 33:53.997
What is it? A lot of spoil piles
    I haven't been over yet.

33:54.099 --> 33:55.599
   I'm gonna check these out.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.434
    Yeah, I'll come help you.

33:57.536 --> 33:59.669
All right, mate, if you can help
      me rake these piles,

33:59.772 --> 34:01.471
     I'll metal detect them.

34:01.573 --> 34:03.006
 And I also want to check where

34:03.108 --> 34:04.875
     Dave's been dumping
    all the big boulders.

34:04.977 --> 34:06.309
       -Because-- Yeah.
       -You never know.

34:06.412 --> 34:07.944
   We can't start up again
      until these piles

34:08.047 --> 34:09.246
   are removed from the area.

34:12.583 --> 34:13.817
       (detector beeping)

34:13.918 --> 34:15.418
  Yeah, I'm getting a hit here.

34:15.521 --> 34:18.621
     All I've found so far
  is just some modern stuff.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.157
        (detector beeps)

34:20.259 --> 34:24.327
     That's a potential.
      It's a potential.

34:24.429 --> 34:25.962
       (detector beeping)

34:26.065 --> 34:27.264
          Oh, there's
    a couple targets here.

34:27.366 --> 34:28.998
   Yeah, that's definitely
          a target,

34:29.101 --> 34:30.500
    let's see how deep it is.

34:30.601 --> 34:32.735
   Only three or four inches.

34:32.838 --> 34:36.339
 -Should be able to pinpoint it.
       -(pinpointer beeps)

34:36.442 --> 34:38.442
      (pinpointer beeping)

34:40.512 --> 34:42.978
      Hopefully it's not
    another piece of slag.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.014
  (pinpointer beeping rapidly)

34:46.985 --> 34:48.150
-Oh, it's probably in your hand.
   -(pinpointer beeps rapidly)

34:48.253 --> 34:49.319
             -Yep.
  -Yeah, that's a good sign.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.254
            (beeping)

34:51.356 --> 34:53.190
     -It's a coin! Look.
           -Yeah!

34:55.127 --> 34:57.394
-GARY: Oh, man, it's not old.
   -JACK: That is awesome.

34:57.496 --> 34:59.196
    You see the date on that?

34:59.298 --> 35:02.399
    -You got younger eyes.
            -1963.

35:02.501 --> 35:05.035
    1963, but heck of a test.

35:05.137 --> 35:07.637
 We knew that if we're gonna
      find some coins,

35:07.739 --> 35:09.539
         it's gonna be
     in this gravel pile.

35:09.641 --> 35:12.175
    The wash plant works.
    That's awesome, Gary.

35:12.277 --> 35:14.778
Yeah. Yeah, that is a good test.
          It really is.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.547
   Certainly gets you excited
anytime you see that coin shape.

35:17.649 --> 35:19.349
        -JACK: Mm-hmm.
          -GARY: Wow.

35:19.451 --> 35:21.418
   I'm gonna see if there's
    anything older in here.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.353
           All right.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.522
NARRATOR: While Jack and Gary
      continue to search

35:25.624 --> 35:27.624
      through the spoils
     at the wash plant...

35:27.726 --> 35:29.726
    TERRY: I want to clean
  this side out a little bit.

35:29.828 --> 35:31.495
  See if we can pick things up.

35:31.597 --> 35:33.897
           NARRATOR:
   Archeologist Laird Niven,

35:33.999 --> 35:36.199
     along with geologist
        Terry Matheson

35:36.301 --> 35:38.935
and heavy equipment operator
       Billy Gerhardt,

35:39.037 --> 35:41.838
  are continuing to excavate
       the area inside

35:41.940 --> 35:44.107
         the so-called
      U-shaped structure.

35:44.209 --> 35:47.244
   A structure they believe
    could have been built

35:47.346 --> 35:49.479
       -centuries ago.
         -(scrapes)

35:49.581 --> 35:52.048
       Whoa. Interesting.

35:52.151 --> 35:53.717
    It looks like a post
    sticking straight up.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.118
          Yeah, it is.

36:01.093 --> 36:03.059
    Laird. Take a quick look.

36:03.162 --> 36:06.062
      Billy just clipped a,
 what looks like, perhaps a post

36:06.165 --> 36:08.131
    -sticking straight up;
     it's pretty vertical.
            -Okay.

36:08.233 --> 36:09.599
             TERRY:
What do you, what do you figure?

36:09.701 --> 36:11.701
             LAIRD:
Actually, that's the third piece

36:11.803 --> 36:12.869
          -of wood.
 -TERRY: It starts to become

36:12.971 --> 36:14.771
          kind of an
    interesting-looking...

36:14.873 --> 36:17.040
      something more than
     just a plank or two.

36:17.142 --> 36:18.842
       Maybe a structure.

36:19.912 --> 36:21.811
           NARRATOR:
        Planks of wood?

36:21.914 --> 36:24.214
         Buried within
    the U-shaped structure?

36:24.316 --> 36:27.217
         Could they be
   a previously undiscovered

36:27.319 --> 36:29.186
part of this ancient formation?

36:29.288 --> 36:31.788
       Or could the team
        have just found

36:31.890 --> 36:34.724
   an entirely new structure
        at Smith's Cove?

36:34.826 --> 36:36.026
            LAIRD:
        I think, uh...

36:36.128 --> 36:38.028
        it may be wise
       just to leave it

36:38.130 --> 36:39.596
         and let Rick
      take a look at it.

36:39.698 --> 36:41.831
  That's probably a good point.

36:41.934 --> 36:43.333
  We could dig around it a bit.

36:43.435 --> 36:45.969
      Try to-- but-but
 no heavy-duty stuff, maybe.

36:47.272 --> 36:49.172
     Surgically now, Billy.

36:59.318 --> 37:01.952
        Whoa, yeah. Yeah.

37:02.054 --> 37:04.521
   This is it, here; we got
   something going on here.

37:04.623 --> 37:06.156
            BILLY:
Yeah, you can see the top of--

37:06.258 --> 37:07.457
           TERRY:
       Gently, gently.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.526
       We're gonna see
    what we can see here.

37:09.628 --> 37:12.162
          Looks like...

37:12.264 --> 37:13.630
        timbers on edge.

37:13.732 --> 37:14.931
  It's not one-inch planks,
           like...

37:15.033 --> 37:16.433
               No.

37:16.535 --> 37:17.934
   Thick enough to be a wall.

37:23.875 --> 37:26.243
               ♪ ♪

37:26.345 --> 37:28.445
 NARRATOR: While excavating
  near the U-shaped structure

37:28.547 --> 37:30.013
        at Smith's Cove...

37:31.316 --> 37:32.649
         Here it comes.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.017
           NARRATOR:
  ...archeologist Laird Niven

37:34.119 --> 37:35.952
         and members
    of the Oak Island team

37:36.054 --> 37:38.355
       have just uncovered

37:38.457 --> 37:40.290
  an unusual man-made formation.

37:40.392 --> 37:41.758
        Odd construction.

37:41.860 --> 37:43.860
          -Very odd.
       -They're offset.

37:43.962 --> 37:46.596
     TERRY: Uh, looks like
  it was built for strength.

37:46.698 --> 37:47.931
           LAIRD:
      Yeah. Pretty big.

37:48.033 --> 37:49.833
      TERRY: Pretty big
   and pretty interesting.

37:49.935 --> 37:51.101
           BILLY:
       Heads up, guys.

37:54.072 --> 37:55.205
        What do you got?

37:55.307 --> 37:56.873
            LAIRD:
        We don't know.

37:56.975 --> 37:59.242
 We started right down here
 and then the next thing is:

37:59.344 --> 38:00.577
   hold it, now, what's this?

38:00.679 --> 38:01.911
    Wow, that's pretty cool.

38:02.014 --> 38:04.214
          You know,
 quite a s-significant wall.

38:05.217 --> 38:06.249
          NARRATOR:
        A wooden wall?

38:06.351 --> 38:08.184
     Buried at Smith's Cove?

38:08.287 --> 38:10.186
     But if so, who built it?

38:10.289 --> 38:12.589
      And for what purpose?

38:12.691 --> 38:14.190
              JACK:
 How deep do these go? Any idea?

38:14.293 --> 38:15.992
           TERRY:
     We're not sure yet.

38:16.094 --> 38:17.761
 It's possible they're trying
      to hold back water

38:17.863 --> 38:19.529
from entering the flood tunnels.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.131
           MARTY:
    Makes you wonder what

38:21.233 --> 38:23.133
 you're gonna find back there
        a little ways.

38:23.235 --> 38:26.403
  LAIRD: But this definitely
       isn't on any map.

38:26.505 --> 38:29.906
   No, this is a new find.
This is totally undiscovered.

38:30.008 --> 38:32.208
           MARTY:
So we're finding these walls

38:32.311 --> 38:33.643
that nobody else has ever found

38:33.745 --> 38:37.380
      which, in a sense,
    is a piece of evidence

38:37.482 --> 38:40.050
        that perhaps
    it could be original,

38:40.152 --> 38:42.252
  because somebody doing it
  originally would've been

38:42.354 --> 38:44.187
      scrupulous about
    clearing up evidence.

38:44.289 --> 38:47.357
      And we're dig it up
      and see what it is.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.661
             RICK:
 Hey. What are we looking at?

38:51.763 --> 38:53.897
          You tell me.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.633
     Oh. That's well-built.

38:56.735 --> 38:58.601
      MARTY: Oh, yeah.
   It's pretty impressive.

39:01.273 --> 39:02.372
    A little bit of blue clay

39:02.474 --> 39:03.773
          -on this...
   -Oh, no there was a lot.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.408
      They scraped it away.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.243
            RICK:
  Oh, here. See this, here?

39:07.346 --> 39:10.180
             JACK:
 It looks like stacked rocks.

39:10.282 --> 39:12.282
            LAIRD:
 There were rocks down there.

39:12.384 --> 39:14.918
    JACK: Are we starting
to get into the French drain?

39:15.954 --> 39:18.221
           NARRATOR:
        A French drain?

39:18.323 --> 39:20.690
        This is packed
    with stones right here

39:20.792 --> 39:22.659
   and just next to it was...

39:22.761 --> 39:24.127
     you know, virgin soil.

39:24.229 --> 39:26.196
          NARRATOR:
       Two years ago...

39:26.298 --> 39:27.697
   while searching for evidence

39:27.799 --> 39:29.466
       of the box drains
        at Smith's Cove,

39:29.568 --> 39:30.734
       The team discovered

39:30.836 --> 39:32.736
    layers of rounded stones,

39:32.838 --> 39:35.805
   forming what they believe
     to be a French drain:

39:35.907 --> 39:38.241
   an ancient irrigation system

39:38.343 --> 39:41.244
        used to control
and direct the flow of water.

39:43.148 --> 39:44.848
       MARTY: I'm gonna
   put you on the spot now.

39:44.950 --> 39:46.282
            Man-made?

39:46.385 --> 39:48.017
  -I believe so, yeah. Yeah.
             -Wow.

39:49.154 --> 39:50.520
          NARRATOR:
      Could these stones

39:50.622 --> 39:52.655
       be another part
   of a French drain system

39:52.758 --> 39:55.925
   constructed centuries ago
        at Smith's Cove?

39:56.027 --> 39:59.462
   And if so, could it mean
the team is closer than ever

39:59.564 --> 40:03.032
to finding one of Oak Island's
    legendary flood tunnels?

40:03.135 --> 40:04.501
    Really, what we should--

40:04.603 --> 40:07.537
  We should just go at this
     real light, Laird.

40:07.639 --> 40:08.805
 -You know? And then just...
            -Yes.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.140
        ...see if this
     really is something.

40:11.877 --> 40:13.843
  NARRATOR: For Rick, Marty
       and their team,

40:13.945 --> 40:16.012
         the discovery
    of another French drain

40:16.114 --> 40:19.048
        at Smith's Cove
       could prove to be

40:19.151 --> 40:21.317
  their biggest breakthrough
       in the 12 years

40:21.420 --> 40:24.587
   since they began searching
  for treasure on Oak Island.

40:24.689 --> 40:27.223
   It offers not only evidence

40:27.325 --> 40:29.626
      that an incredible
      engineering effort

40:29.728 --> 40:31.828
  took place here centuries ago.

40:31.930 --> 40:34.264
It could also be the first step

40:34.366 --> 40:36.599
   in locating the entrance
        to the fabled

40:36.701 --> 40:38.568
   booby-trapped flood tunnels.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.770
     And perhaps to whatever

40:40.872 --> 40:42.639
   they were built to protect.

40:42.741 --> 40:45.508
      But as the Laginas
      and their partners

40:45.610 --> 40:48.077
      continue to follow
   the flood system further

40:48.180 --> 40:50.513
        and deeper down
      into the Money Pit,

40:50.615 --> 40:53.016
     where will it lead them?

40:53.118 --> 40:56.286
  To a treasure vault filled
    with gold and jewels?

40:58.423 --> 41:02.392
Or will they discover that as
they get to closer to solving

41:02.494 --> 41:05.929
    a 223-year-old mystery...

41:06.031 --> 41:09.199
           the island
  will fight harder than ever

41:09.301 --> 41:12.802
  to protect its buried secrets?

41:16.541 --> 41:18.174
          Next time on
  The Curse of Oak Island...

41:18.276 --> 41:20.710
 DOUG: I found a description
     on the finger drains

41:20.812 --> 41:23.279
in Smith's Cove-- these drains
     were made by placing

41:23.381 --> 41:26.382
 -two stones on their edges.
       -ALEX: This is
   new information for us.

41:26.485 --> 41:28.785
  DOUG: Look between those two
rocks. There's an opening there.

41:28.887 --> 41:31.554
 -It was a triangular shape.
    -RICK: That could be
        a box drain.

41:31.656 --> 41:33.623
 -TORY: It's just over here,
            guys.
   -RICK: We've never seen

41:33.725 --> 41:34.791
    another stone like this
         on the island.

41:34.893 --> 41:36.593
            CRAIG:
  Almost like Roman numerals.

41:36.695 --> 41:37.694
           MARTY:
       It's mysterious,

41:37.796 --> 41:38.728
        and it was found
      near the Money Pit.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.463
   TERRY: Whoa! Looks like
     we have something,

41:40.565 --> 41:42.699
