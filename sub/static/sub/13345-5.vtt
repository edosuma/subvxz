WEBVTT

00:07.708 --> 00:10.044
( train horn blows )

00:10.144 --> 00:12.780
EXCUSE ME.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.083
EXCUSE ME.

00:17.885 --> 00:19.787
EXCUSE ME.

00:19.887 --> 00:21.655
( sighs heavily )

00:21.755 --> 00:23.491
LET'S SEE...

00:23.591 --> 00:25.259
I THINK THIS--

00:25.359 --> 00:27.661
( clears throat )
IS THAT FREE?

00:27.761 --> 00:29.763
THAT THERE--
IS THAT FREE?

00:29.863 --> 00:30.764
SURE.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.834
THANKS.

00:33.934 --> 00:35.836
UH, DO YOU MIND?

00:35.936 --> 00:38.139
THAT'S GREAT.

00:38.239 --> 00:40.141
THAT'S GREAT.
THANK YOU.

00:40.241 --> 00:42.610
( grunts )
THERE WE GO.

00:42.710 --> 00:46.580
OH, BOY.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.582
( sighs )

00:48.682 --> 00:52.953
OH, BOY, I'LL TELL YOU,
WHAT A DAY.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.256
- HEY, THANKS A LOT.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.228
HOW'S IT GOING?

01:00.328 --> 01:01.962
GOOD.
GOOD, THANKS.

01:02.062 --> 01:06.100
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
THE AFTERNOON TRAINS
WOULD BE LESS CROWDED.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.837
FRIDAY--
IT'S BAD ALL DAY.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.239
SURE.

01:11.339 --> 01:13.874
AND IT GETS MORE CROWDED
THE LONGER YOU STAY ON.

01:13.974 --> 01:15.776
UH-HUH, SURE.

01:15.876 --> 01:18.246
AND BY THE TIME
WE GET TO D.C.

01:18.346 --> 01:21.882
I'LL BE SITTING
IN YOUR LAP.

01:21.982 --> 01:23.217
I'M JUST JOKING.

01:23.317 --> 01:26.820
JUST JOKING.
NO OFFENSE.

01:26.920 --> 01:30.124
MY STUPID SHRINK
SAYS I SHOULD SAY
SHIT LIKE THAT.

01:30.224 --> 01:32.526
BUT WHAT DOES HE KNOW?

01:32.626 --> 01:35.296
LAST YEAR HE TELLS ME
I SHOULD LEAVE MY WIFE.

01:35.396 --> 01:38.031
NOW WHO DO I GOT
LEFT TO TALK TO?

01:38.132 --> 01:40.168
STRANGERS ON TRAINS.

01:42.736 --> 01:46.073
SO WHAT DO YOU DO?

01:46.174 --> 01:47.875
I'M IN SALES.

01:47.975 --> 01:49.710
AH.

01:49.810 --> 01:52.480
( theme music playing )

02:09.863 --> 02:12.666
( knocks on door )

02:15.135 --> 02:18.706
- HI.
- HI.

02:22.743 --> 02:27.381
YOU'VE DONE A NICE JOB
ON THE PLACE.

02:27.481 --> 02:31.552
I TRIED TO WARM IT UP
A BIT.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.853
SIT DOWN.

02:32.953 --> 02:35.823
LISTEN, THANKS FOR TAKING
THE TIME OUT TO SEE ME.

02:35.923 --> 02:39.092
I KNOW
YOU'RE REALLY BUSY.

02:39.193 --> 02:42.463
I'D ALWAYS SEE YOU.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.969
SO I'VE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT YOU.
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM YOU
FOR A WHILE.

02:49.069 --> 02:50.604
YEAH, I KNOW.

02:50.704 --> 02:55.075
I'M NOT SO GREAT
AT KEEPING IN TOUCH.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.110
NO, I KNOW YOU HAD
YOUR REASONS.

02:57.211 --> 02:59.913
A LOT'S HAPPENED,
YOU KNOW?

03:03.884 --> 03:04.952
DID MY LAWYER
CALL YOU?

03:05.052 --> 03:06.787
YES, HE DID.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.089
I'M SO SORRY, PAUL.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.691
TO HAVE A PATIENT DIE
IS TERRIBLE.

03:10.791 --> 03:13.327
BUT THEN TO HAVE
THE FAMILY SUE YOU IS--

03:13.427 --> 03:16.430
DID HE SAY THAT
HE WANTS YOU TO TESTIFY?

03:16.530 --> 03:18.499
HE DID.
I'M GOING TO BE DEPOSED.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.201
ALTHOUGH I'M NOT SURE
HOW MUCH HELP I CAN BE.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.937
THAT'S WHAT
THEY WANT ME

03:24.037 --> 03:27.007
TO KIND OF
SUSS OUT FROM YOU.

03:27.107 --> 03:31.279
WELL, YOU DIDN'T REALLY
TALK MUCH ABOUT ALEX
UNTIL AFTER HE DIED.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.614
I TOLD THEM
YOU WEREN'T IN THE ROOM.

03:33.714 --> 03:36.450
YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY KNOW
WHETHER OR NOT I GAVE HIM
THE PROPER CARE.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.420
YOU DIDN'T KEEP ANY NOTES,
DID YOU?

03:39.520 --> 03:41.789
- I DON'T NEED NOTES.
YOU DON'T NEED NOTES.
- NO NO.

03:41.889 --> 03:45.426
WAS IT MY NOT TAKING NOTES
THAT KILLED HIM?

03:45.526 --> 03:47.761
I HAVEN'T TAKEN NOTES
IN 15 YEARS, GINA.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.598
SHOULD WE PUT ALL
THE REST OF MY PATIENTS
ON SUICIDE WATCH?

03:50.698 --> 03:52.032
WHY DO YOU CALL IT
A SUICIDE?

03:52.132 --> 03:53.567
ISN'T THAT WHAT
EVERYBODY THINKS?

03:53.667 --> 03:56.570
NO, PAUL, HE DIED.
THAT'S ALL ANYBODY CAN KNOW.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.506
HE EITHER KILLED HIMSELF
OR I KILLED HIM.

03:58.606 --> 04:02.242
- TAKE YOUR PICK.
- PAUL,

04:02.343 --> 04:05.446
WHATEVER HAPPENED BETWEEN
YOU AND ALEX IN TREATMENT,

04:05.546 --> 04:07.281
YOU DIDN'T KILL HIM.

04:07.381 --> 04:09.417
YOU WERE TRYING
TO HELP HIM.

04:09.517 --> 04:13.220
HE LEFT THERAPY.
HIS PLANE CRASHED.
HE DIED.

04:13.321 --> 04:15.222
THOSE THINGS OCCURRED
IN A SEQUENCE,

04:15.323 --> 04:17.157
BUT THEY ARE NOT
CAUSALLY RELATED.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.626
- I KNOW THAT.
- I KNOW YOU KNOW THAT.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.260
I'M JUST SAYING IT
SO YOU CAN HEAR IT.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.995
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I KNEW THAT TOO.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.664
( chuckles )

04:26.233 --> 04:29.169
WHEN SOMEONE DIES,

04:29.269 --> 04:31.305
YOU WANT
AN EXPLANATION.

04:31.405 --> 04:34.608
BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
THERE IS ONE.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.478
( knocks on door )

04:37.578 --> 04:39.947
I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT
COULD BE. SORRY.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.487
I'M SORRY, GINA.
I LEFT MY GLASSES.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.756
OH, COME IN.
I DIDN'T SEE THEM,
BUT TAKE A LOOK.

04:50.991 --> 04:52.626
PAUL.

04:52.726 --> 04:55.729
TAMMY.

04:57.598 --> 05:00.601
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD.

05:00.701 --> 05:03.337
AND YOU?

05:03.437 --> 05:05.739
I BARGE RIGHT IN.
THAT'S ME.
I'M SORRY.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.708
NO, PAUL IS A FRIEND.
HE'S NOT A PATIENT.

05:07.808 --> 05:11.244
I LEFT MY GLASSES,
OR AT LEAST I HOPE
I LEFT THEM HERE.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.714
OH, THERE THEY ARE.

05:15.749 --> 05:18.151
- HERE YOU GO.
- THANKS.

05:18.251 --> 05:21.121
IMAGINE, AFTER
ALL THESE YEARS.

05:21.221 --> 05:22.590
YES, IT'S BEEN
A LONG TIME.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.658
- YOU LOOK GREAT.
- YOU TOO.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.327
I'M SORRY.
I SHOULD'VE CALLED.

05:29.262 --> 05:31.064
- BYE.
- BYE.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.700
- SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.
- OKAY.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.637
( laughs )

05:36.737 --> 05:38.506
IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU SMILE.

05:38.606 --> 05:42.009
I KEEP FORGETTING
HOW SMALL THIS TOWN IS.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.544
THAT'S TAMMY KENT,
RIGHT?

05:43.644 --> 05:47.180
SHE'S TAMMY MESWICK NOW.

05:47.280 --> 05:51.385
YOU KNOW, WE GREW UP
ON THE SAME STREET,

05:51.485 --> 05:53.120
10 MINUTES FROM HERE.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.288
SHE'S YOUR--?

05:55.389 --> 05:57.290
ARE YOU SEEING
PATIENTS AGAIN?

05:57.391 --> 05:59.693
I AM.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.430
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
A WRITER NOW.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.331
JUST THE ONE BOOK.

06:04.432 --> 06:05.933
BUT PEOPLE SEEMED
TO LIKE IT.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.068
YEAH, I SAW
THE REVIEWS.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.537
THEY MORE THAN
LIKED IT.

06:09.637 --> 06:11.572
YOU DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO READ IT?

06:11.672 --> 06:15.809
TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH, GINA,

06:15.909 --> 06:19.212
I DON'T THINK I'M READY
TO READ IT YET.

06:19.312 --> 06:21.649
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

06:21.749 --> 06:23.016
I DO.

06:23.116 --> 06:25.619
I ENJOYED WRITING,

06:25.719 --> 06:29.089
BUT I FEEL LIKE I'VE HAD
ENOUGH TIME ALONE FOR NOW.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.024
HAVE YOU EVER LIVED
BY YOURSELF?

06:31.124 --> 06:34.662
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME

06:34.762 --> 06:39.199
IN FOREVER

06:39.299 --> 06:41.368
THAT I'VE LIVED ALONE.

06:41.469 --> 06:43.837
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?
I'M 53 YEARS OF AGE

06:43.937 --> 06:47.240
AND I'VE NEVER LIVED
BY MYSELF.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.209
IT TAKES SOME
GETTING USED TO.

06:49.309 --> 06:51.712
BUT THERE ARE GOOD
THINGS ABOUT IT.

06:51.812 --> 06:54.147
YEAH.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.654
GINA, ABOUT THIS LAWSUIT--

07:00.754 --> 07:03.156
WHAT I'M GOING
TO TELL THEM IS

07:03.256 --> 07:05.158
THAT YOU DID
EVERYTHING YOU COULD

07:05.258 --> 07:07.027
TO HELP THIS PATIENT
IN TREATMENT,

07:07.127 --> 07:10.063
AND THAT IF YOU HAD FELT
HE WAS IN ANY DANGER,

07:10.163 --> 07:12.065
YOU WOULD'VE
TRIED ANYTHING

07:12.165 --> 07:13.901
TO KEEP HIM
FROM FLYING AGAIN.

07:14.001 --> 07:16.236
OKAY.
THANK YOU.

07:16.336 --> 07:17.871
YOU THINK THAT'LL HELP?

07:17.971 --> 07:20.407
I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS
WHAT YOU SAY.

07:20.508 --> 07:21.909
THE OTHER SIDE ARE GONNA
HAVE THEIR EXPERTS.

07:22.009 --> 07:24.377
AND THEY WON'T
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE
TALKING ABOUT EITHER.

07:24.478 --> 07:25.946
THEY WON'T KNOW WHAT
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT?

07:26.046 --> 07:28.516
THE WHOLE CASE IS GONNA
BE DECIDED BY PEOPLE

07:28.616 --> 07:30.584
WHO HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT WENT ON IN THE ROOM.

07:30.684 --> 07:33.053
THEN THE ETHICS BOARD ARE
GONNA TAKE AWAY MY LICENSE

07:33.153 --> 07:35.789
BECAUSE IT'S
THE CHEAPEST WAY
TO SETTLE THE THING.

07:35.889 --> 07:39.192
I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY
TO FIGHT IT.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.161
IF THE JURY
AWARDS THEM

07:41.261 --> 07:43.531
ANY MORE THAN
THE $3 MILLION
THE INSURANCE WILL COVER,

07:43.631 --> 07:45.365
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
DECLARE BANKRUPTCY.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.300
I'LL LOSE THE APARTMENT
IN BROOKLYN

07:47.400 --> 07:51.171
AND ANYTHING I HAVE LEFT
AFTER CHILD SUPPORT
AND ALIMONY.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.574
BROOKLYN?
YOU MOVED TO BROOKLYN?

07:53.674 --> 07:55.776
AND KATE AND THE KIDS
ARE STILL HERE?

07:55.876 --> 07:58.145
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS,

07:58.245 --> 08:00.313
THEY CAN HAVE
MY LICENSE.

08:00.413 --> 08:01.915
THEY CAN
HAVE MY PRACTICE.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.751
I'M AN EDUCATED MAN.

08:03.851 --> 08:08.756
I CAN DO SOMETHING
RESPECTABLE,

08:08.856 --> 08:10.490
OR NOT.

08:10.591 --> 08:13.460
I JUST DON'T CARE.
I DON'T CARE ANYMORE.

08:13.561 --> 08:16.063
THE TRUTH IS,
I'M JUST FUCKING SICK

08:16.163 --> 08:18.799
OF SITTING IN A CHAIR
DAY AFTER DAY AFTER DAY

08:18.899 --> 08:21.401
LISTENING TO
PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.503
OH, BOY.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.707
OH, BOY.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.912
YEAH.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.181
SORRY.

08:36.483 --> 08:40.988
KATE AND THE KIDS
ARE STILL HERE.

08:42.623 --> 08:46.794
IAN IS IN COLLEGE.

08:46.894 --> 08:50.764
I'VE BECOME ONE
OF THOSE AMTRAK DADS.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.966
I SEE THE KIDS
ON WEEKENDS.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.301
THAT MUST BE HARD.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.169
YEAH.

08:56.269 --> 08:59.740
BUT MY ALMA MATER
HAVE OFFERED ME
A TEACHING POSITION.

08:59.840 --> 09:04.544
I WAS HOPING THAT
THAT MIGHT MEAN
A FRESH START.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.546
SOME NEW PROBLEMS
TO LISTEN TO.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.916
THERE ARE
NO NEW PROBLEMS.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.550
I KNOW.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.623
WHY DO WE DO THIS, GINA?

09:15.723 --> 09:20.694
DON'T YOU GET TIRED
OF SITTING IN THE CHAIR?

09:22.329 --> 09:25.165
THAT'S WHY I TOOK
TWO YEARS OFF.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.771
MY OFFICE IS
IN MY LIVING ROOM,

09:30.871 --> 09:33.440
SO I ACTUALLY NEVER
GET AWAY FROM THEM.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.108
THEY LEAVE THINGS
IN THE SOFA.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.010
I'LL BE READING
OR DOZING OFF,
AND SOMEBODY'S EARRING

09:37.110 --> 09:39.546
OR A DATE BOOK
WILL FALL OUT
ON THE FLOOR.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.782
YOU'RE SLEEPING
IN THE LIVING ROOM?

09:41.882 --> 09:45.185
IT'S A GOOD
SLEEPING COUCH.

09:45.285 --> 09:47.721
I MADE SURE OF THAT,

09:47.821 --> 09:52.159
IN CASE ROSIE OR MAX
COME TO VISIT.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.729
DID I TELL YOU ROSIE IS
LOOKING AT COLLEGES NOW?

09:55.829 --> 09:59.532
AND MAX--
MAX LIKES THE METS,

09:59.633 --> 10:02.169
WHICH COULD BE AN EARLY
SIGN OF MASOCHISM.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.305
I PROMISED
TO TAKE HIM TO A GAME

10:05.405 --> 10:09.242
IF HE EVER COMES
TO SEE ME.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.346
DO YOU THINK
IT WILL WORK?

10:13.446 --> 10:15.415
I'M SURE
IT WILL WORK.

10:15.515 --> 10:18.686
YOU JUST NEED
TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME,

10:18.786 --> 10:21.855
FIND SOME GOOD
RESTAURANTS

10:21.955 --> 10:23.623
FOR YOU AND THE KIDS
TO EAT AT,

10:23.724 --> 10:25.693
FIND SOME
NEW ROUTINES.

10:25.793 --> 10:29.029
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE
ALONE FOR LONG, PAUL.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.466
BUT I WANT
TO BE ALONE.

10:33.566 --> 10:37.738
I HAD MY CHANCE
AT LOVE LAST YEAR

10:37.838 --> 10:39.940
AND I BLEW IT.
I'M NOT TAKING
THAT RISK AGAIN.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.541
THAT RISK?

10:41.641 --> 10:44.044
THE RISK OF SEEING
HOW HAPPY I COULD BE.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.379
THE RISK OF HAVING
SOMEBODY WANT ME.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.716
THE RISK
OF BEING HAPPY.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.383
NO, THANKS.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.753
THE TRUTH IS, I'M STILL
FUCKING ANGRY

10:52.853 --> 10:56.890
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.426
I--

10:59.526 --> 11:02.495
I THOUGHT
I WAS COMING

11:02.595 --> 11:04.732
TO FIND OUT
ABOUT YOUR DEPOSITION.

11:04.832 --> 11:07.234
WHY DID YOU COME HERE?

11:15.108 --> 11:19.412
I NEED SOME CLARITY
IN MY LIFE, GINA.

11:19.512 --> 11:23.550
I NEED YOU TO EXPLAIN
HOW I LET THIS--

11:23.650 --> 11:26.153
WHATEVER YOU CALL IT--
LOVE FOR LAURA,

11:26.253 --> 11:28.722
BLIND ME TO THE NEEDS
OF MY PATIENT.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.490
ALEX USED LAURA
TO GET ME.

11:30.590 --> 11:33.126
BY THE TIME HE WAS
FINISHED IN THERAPY,
I HATED HIM.

11:33.226 --> 11:34.694
I REALLY HATED HIM.

11:34.795 --> 11:36.629
- I LET MY FEELINGS
FOR THIS--
- YOUR LOVE.

11:36.730 --> 11:39.199
ALL RIGHT,
MY LOVE FOR LAURA,

11:39.299 --> 11:40.834
WHICH, BY THE WAY,

11:40.934 --> 11:45.138
I NEVER GOT TO EXPRESS
PHYSICALLY OR--

11:45.238 --> 11:47.040
- MY LOVE FOR THIS--
- BEAUTIFUL.

11:47.140 --> 11:50.744
YES, SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL.
STOP PUTTING WORDS
IN MY MOUTH.

11:50.844 --> 11:54.247
I'M SORRY.
WHEN YOU CALLED,
YOU ASKED IF WE COULD TALK.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.682
THIS IS HOW FRIENDS TALK.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.818
I DON'T THINK
I HAVE ANY FRIENDS.

11:57.918 --> 11:59.619
IT'S TOO BAD
YOU DON'T HAVE A DOG.

11:59.719 --> 12:02.389
- YOU COULD
MESS THAT UP TOO.
- OH, GOD.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.858
WOULD YOU STOP?

12:04.958 --> 12:08.395
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO, PAUL?

12:08.495 --> 12:10.764
HMM?

12:10.864 --> 12:14.802
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

12:16.669 --> 12:19.106
I WANT TO KNOW

12:19.206 --> 12:23.410
WHAT TO FEEL
ABOUT ALL THIS.

12:23.510 --> 12:24.778
ABOUT ALL WHAT?

12:24.878 --> 12:27.280
EVERYTHING.

12:27.380 --> 12:30.650
EVERYTHING
IN MY LIFE.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.386
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL?

12:35.755 --> 12:37.590
NO.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.993
I DON'T KNOW
HOW I FEEL.

12:40.093 --> 12:43.263
AND THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE HERE?

12:45.598 --> 12:49.436
I NEED YOUR HELP, GINA.

12:52.672 --> 12:55.242
OKAY.
OKAY.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.845
SO WHEN YOU STOPPED
ALEX'S THERAPY--

12:57.945 --> 12:59.646
NO, HE STOPPED IT.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.982
HE SHOWED UP AT MY DOOR
IN A UNIFORM.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.951
HE'D ALREADY MADE
A DECISION.

13:04.051 --> 13:07.287
OKAY, WHEN HE
STOPPED THERAPY,

13:07.387 --> 13:10.290
DID YOU FEEL THAT
THE THERAPY HAD FAILED?

13:10.390 --> 13:12.092
- NO.
- GOOD.

13:12.192 --> 13:15.528
HE CAME TO ME BECAUSE
HE WAS AFRAID TO FLY.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.697
AND HE STOPPED THERAPY

13:17.797 --> 13:20.067
BECAUSE HE FELT THAT
HE WAS READY GO BACK.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.668
SO YOU MET HIS GOALS
FOR THE TREATMENT.

13:21.768 --> 13:23.303
YES.

13:23.403 --> 13:25.438
AND DID YOU HAVE DIFFERENT
GOALS FOR HIS TREATMENT?

13:25.538 --> 13:27.474
YES, I DID.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.176
AND WHAT WERE
YOUR GOALS?

13:29.276 --> 13:33.046
WELL, YOU KNOW, I HOPED
THAT HE'D BE ABLE

13:33.146 --> 13:35.949
- TO FORGIVE HIMSELF FOR--
- FOR WHAT?

13:36.049 --> 13:38.785
FOR WHAT HE DID.
HE DROPPED A BOMB
ON A SCHOOL.

13:38.886 --> 13:40.220
RIGHT.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.355
AND WAS HE ABLE
TO FORGIVE HIMSELF?

13:42.455 --> 13:45.225
I DON'T KNOW.
DO PEOPLE EVER FORGIVE
THEMSELVES REALLY?

13:45.325 --> 13:47.227
I KNOW WE TALK
ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME,

13:47.327 --> 13:49.229
BUT DO PEOPLE EVER
REALLY DO IT?

13:49.329 --> 13:50.830
SOMETIMES.

13:50.931 --> 13:54.634
SOMETIMES, YEAH.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.904
HOW LONG
DOES IT TAKE?

13:58.939 --> 14:02.342
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT SOMETHING

14:02.442 --> 14:05.112
YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO
FORGIVE YOURSELF FOR?

14:05.212 --> 14:07.180
WHAT, LIKE BREAKING UP
MY MARRIAGE,

14:07.280 --> 14:09.216
DESTROYING MY KIDS' LIVES,
WRECKING MY CAREER,

14:09.316 --> 14:11.751
NOT BEING ABLE
TO SAVE MY MOTHER

14:11.851 --> 14:14.154
AND NOT PAYING ATTENTION
TO MY FATHER?

14:14.254 --> 14:16.056
THAT WOULD
ABOUT COVER IT.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.958
ARE YOU
LAUGHING AT ME?

14:19.292 --> 14:21.828
WHY NOT?
WE SHOULD BOTH LAUGH.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.897
BUT I CAN'T.

14:23.997 --> 14:27.067
SO YOU GO AHEAD,

14:27.167 --> 14:31.138
LAUGH AT MY
MESS OF A LIFE.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.178
WOULD YOU LIKE
A DRINK?

14:40.047 --> 14:43.616
SURE.
WHY NOT?

14:45.052 --> 14:46.853
IT'S FUN NOT HAVING
THERAPY, ISN'T IT?

14:46.954 --> 14:48.989
IS VODKA OKAY?

14:49.089 --> 14:51.491
YEAH, THAT'D BE GREAT.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.596
- I ONLY HAVE SODA.
- THAT'S FINE.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.407
OKAY, TO--

15:07.507 --> 15:09.542
TO OLD FRIENDS.

15:11.144 --> 15:14.514
AND TO TAMMY KENT.

15:14.614 --> 15:15.949
TO TAMMY KENT.

15:16.049 --> 15:17.951
TELL ME ABOUT TAMMY.

15:18.051 --> 15:21.354
WELL, I THINK
I CAN SAY

15:21.454 --> 15:23.623
THAT I WOULD NEVER HAVE
SURVIVED MY ADOLESCENCE

15:23.723 --> 15:25.392
IF IT HADN'T BEEN
FOR HER.

15:25.492 --> 15:29.529
SHE WAS MY FIRST LOVE.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.498
WAS SHE?

15:31.598 --> 15:34.301
AND EVEN BEFORE THAT
SHE WAS

15:34.401 --> 15:37.204
- THE ONLY ONE WHO KNEW--
- WHO KNEW--?

15:37.304 --> 15:41.841
HER FAMILY LIVED
DOWN THE HALLWAY FROM US.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.977
AND THE NIGHT
MY MOTHER WAS--

15:44.077 --> 15:47.480
SHE WENT
TO THE HOSPITAL--

15:47.580 --> 15:51.051
ANYWAY, LET'S NOT TALK
ABOUT TAMMY KENT.

15:51.151 --> 15:55.522
BESIDES,
SHE'S YOUR PATIENT.

15:57.357 --> 16:01.061
SO CAN WE GO BACK
TO THE LAWSUIT?

16:02.195 --> 16:04.264
AFTER ALEX'S FUNERAL,

16:04.364 --> 16:06.299
NOTHING MORE HAS HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU AND LAURA?

16:06.399 --> 16:09.269
NO, I COULDN'T EVEN--
I COULDN'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT LAURA

16:09.369 --> 16:11.271
WITHOUT BLAMING MYSELF
FOR HIS DEATH.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.140
IF I HADN'T BEEN
IN LOVE WITH HER,

16:13.240 --> 16:14.741
IF I HADN'T BEEN
JEALOUS OF HIM,

16:14.841 --> 16:18.578
IF I HADN'T BEEN
COMPETING WITH HIM
FOR HER LOVE--

16:18.678 --> 16:21.114
YOU MIGHT HAVE SAVED HIM.
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

16:21.214 --> 16:23.783
- YEAH, I GUESS SO.
- YOU GUESS SO?

16:23.883 --> 16:27.620
ISN'T THAT WHAT
WE ALL WANT TO DO--
SAVE OUR PATIENTS?

16:27.720 --> 16:29.389
IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT?

16:29.489 --> 16:32.325
THIS IS BEGINNING
TO SEEM LIKE THERAPY.

16:32.425 --> 16:35.328
WELL, WE'RE FRIENDS
TALKING ABOUT WORK.

16:35.428 --> 16:37.330
OKAY.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.999
THEN LET'S--

16:40.100 --> 16:43.736
LET'S TALK
ABOUT THE WORK.

16:46.173 --> 16:50.177
OKAY, I HAVE
A NEW PATIENT.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.179
HER NAME IS APRIL.

16:52.279 --> 16:55.348
SHE'S JUST LEARNED
THAT SHE'S GOT LYMPHOMA.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.853
YEAH, SHE'S TERRIFIED
AND SHE'S IN DENIAL.

17:00.953 --> 17:03.090
SHE HASN'T
TOLD ANYBODY--

17:03.190 --> 17:04.924
NOT HER FAMILY,
NOT HER FRIENDS,

17:05.024 --> 17:06.259
NOBODY EXCEPT ME.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.394
WHY NOT?

17:07.494 --> 17:10.297
SHE SAYS SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO HAVE THE CHEMO.

17:10.397 --> 17:12.465
I THINK SHE PROBABLY HAS
AN UNCONSCIOUS FANTASY

17:12.565 --> 17:15.168
THAT IF SHE DOESN'T
HAVE THE TREATMENT,

17:15.268 --> 17:17.370
SHE DOESN'T HAVE
THE CANCER.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.239
YOU HAVEN'T SAID
THAT TO HER YET?

17:19.339 --> 17:21.774
I DON'T THINK SHE'S
READY TO HEAR IT YET.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.078
AND I DON'T HAVE
THE TIME

17:25.178 --> 17:27.680
TO GET HER THERE.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.083
I MEAN,
WITH THE PARTICULAR
CANCER THAT SHE HAS,

17:30.183 --> 17:31.984
IF SHE STARTS
TREATMENT NOW

17:32.085 --> 17:34.621
HER CHANCES OF RECOVERY
ARE PRETTY GOOD.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.056
BUT IF SHE DOESN'T--

17:39.159 --> 17:40.793
LOOK, IF IT WAS
MY DAUGHTER

17:40.893 --> 17:42.829
I WOULD JUST TAKE HER
BY THE ARM

17:42.929 --> 17:45.498
AND I WOULD DRAG HER
TO THE HOSPITAL.

17:45.598 --> 17:48.201
OF COURSE YOU WOULD.
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO
FOR YOUR FAMILY.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.237
BUT NOT FOR YOUR
PATIENTS?

17:53.173 --> 17:55.007
THIS IS THE QUESTION.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.843
WHAT DOES
THE GOOD THERAPIST DO

17:56.943 --> 17:58.845
WHEN THE PATIENT NEEDS

17:58.945 --> 18:02.315
MORE THAN JUST TALK?

18:02.415 --> 18:04.117
DO YOU JUST SIT
THERE AND LISTEN

18:04.217 --> 18:06.219
UNTIL SHE DIES
ON THE COUCH?

18:06.319 --> 18:08.054
YOU CAN ONLY BE
RESPONSIBLE

18:08.155 --> 18:10.390
FOR WHAT HAPPENS
IN TREATMENT, PAUL.
YOU KNOW THAT.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.526
SO ARE YOU SAYING
THAT YOU WOULDN'T
TAKE HER TO CHEMO?

18:13.626 --> 18:15.695
I WOULD DO
EVERYTHING I COULD
TO GET HER TO GO.

18:15.795 --> 18:19.065
AND IF SHE
STILL REFUSED?

18:19.166 --> 18:22.169
I'M JUST AFRAID THAT
THIS GIRL IS GOING TO DIE.

18:22.269 --> 18:25.172
AND I CAN'T
GET INVOLVED

18:25.272 --> 18:27.274
BECAUSE I'M AFRAID
OF ANOTHER LAWSUIT.

18:27.374 --> 18:29.976
OKAY, THEN STOP BEING
HER THERAPIST AND
BECOME HER NURSE.

18:30.076 --> 18:33.280
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
DON'T SIMPLIFY IT.

18:34.914 --> 18:38.218
I MEAN, ARE YOU SAYING
THAT YOU WOULDN'T HELP HER?

18:38.318 --> 18:40.387
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT

18:40.487 --> 18:42.455
WE WERE ON THE EARTH FOR--
TO HELP EACH OTHER

18:42.555 --> 18:46.426
AND STEP UP TO THE PLATE
WHEN SOMEBODY NEEDS US.

18:49.095 --> 18:50.897
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
TREATING HER?

18:50.997 --> 18:52.599
A WEEK.

18:52.699 --> 18:56.469
YOU'VE SEEN HER ONLY ONCE
AND SHE'S MADE YOU
FEEL THIS--?

18:56.569 --> 18:58.471
I'M JUST AFRAID
THAT SHE'S GOING TO DIE.

18:58.571 --> 19:02.475
AND I'M ANGRY THAT SHE
WON'T LET ME HELP HER.

19:02.575 --> 19:05.412
ISN'T THIS THE SAME ANGER
THAT YOU FELT TOWARDS ALEX

19:05.512 --> 19:07.647
BECAUSE HE WOULDN'T
LET YOU SAVE HIM?

19:07.747 --> 19:10.617
THIS ISN'T
ABOUT ALEX, GINA.
THIS IS ABOUT APRIL.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.286
I DON'T THINK THIS IS
ABOUT YOUR PATIENTS AT ALL.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.954
I KNOW YOU DON'T.

19:15.054 --> 19:18.225
YOU HAD THIS ANGER
BEFORE THESE PATIENTS
WALKED INTO YOUR OFFICE.

19:18.325 --> 19:20.527
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DRAG ME
DOWN THAT PATH AGAIN.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.395
NO, I AM NOT DRAGGING
YOU DOWN ANY PATH.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.963
YOU THINK THIS IS
ABOUT MY MOTHER.

19:24.063 --> 19:25.632
YES, I THINK THIS IS
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.967
I DON'T WANT TO GO
INTO THERAPY.

19:28.067 --> 19:30.437
OKAY.

19:30.537 --> 19:33.306
OKAY.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.915
HOW DID YOU LEAVE
THINGS WITH HER?

19:43.015 --> 19:45.051
I MADE HER PROMISE
TO CALL ME.

19:45.151 --> 19:48.355
AND I CALLED HER
A COUPLE OF TIMES
YESTERDAY.

19:48.455 --> 19:49.956
I CALLED HER
THREE TIMES TODAY.

19:50.056 --> 19:51.824
SHE STILL HASN'T
CALLED BACK.

19:51.924 --> 19:53.626
I JUST--

19:53.726 --> 19:55.428
YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO
HELP THIS GIRL.

19:55.528 --> 19:58.998
PAUL, WE'RE NOT GODS.
WE CAN'T SAVE ANYBODY.

19:59.098 --> 20:01.668
YOU REALLY CARE
ABOUT YOUR PATIENTS.

20:01.768 --> 20:04.537
BUT I HAVE TO SAY,
YOU'RE NO GOOD TO ANYBODY

20:04.637 --> 20:07.240
AS LONG AS YOU ARE LIVING
WITH ALL THIS FEAR AND ANGER.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.909
WHAT, FEAR THAT
I CAN'T SAVE THEM,

20:10.009 --> 20:12.379
FEAR THAT THEY'RE
ALL GONNA DIE?

20:12.479 --> 20:15.147
- THEY WON'T ALL DIE.
- YEAH, BUT MY MOTHER DIED.

20:15.248 --> 20:18.518
YOU CAN SAY IT.
GO ON. GO AHEAD.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.219
YES.

20:20.320 --> 20:24.123
IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING
YOU COULD DO,

20:24.223 --> 20:26.158
YOUR MOTHER DIED.

20:26.259 --> 20:28.395
AND IF YOUR MOTHER
COULD DIE,

20:28.495 --> 20:30.830
THE ONE WHO PROMISED YOU
SHE WOULD ALWAYS BE THERE--

20:30.930 --> 20:32.699
SHE DIDN'T
PROMISE ME THAT.

20:32.799 --> 20:34.801
- BUT YOU THOUGHT SHE DID.
- YEAH, I THOUGHT SHE DID--

20:34.901 --> 20:37.437
BECAUSE SHE
BROUGHT ME INTO THE WORLD,
SHE WAS GONNA STAY WITH ME.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.707
AS A KID
I THOUGHT THAT.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.942
SHE WAS SICK, PAUL.

20:43.042 --> 20:45.278
SHE WAS TOO SICK
FOR YOU TO SAVE HER.

20:45.378 --> 20:49.816
YEAH, I WISH
YOU COULD TELL THAT
TO MY UNCONSCIOUS.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.251
IT WAS DEVASTATING.

20:53.853 --> 20:57.424
IF YOU COULD
HAVE SAVED HER,
YOU WOULD HAVE.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.130
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE FEELING NOW?

21:04.230 --> 21:08.535
LOOK,

21:08.635 --> 21:11.771
WHAT IF I--

21:11.871 --> 21:15.375
WHAT IF I WANTED
TO COME BACK TO YOU
FOR THERAPY--

21:15.475 --> 21:17.410
NO SUPERVISION,
NO BLURRED LINES,

21:17.510 --> 21:21.280
JUST PLAIN OLD THERAPY?

21:24.484 --> 21:26.753
YOU THINK
YOU CAN TRUST ME?

21:29.389 --> 21:31.558
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
I CAN TRUST.

21:33.526 --> 21:35.328
BESIDES, I'D FEEL
REALLY STUPID

21:35.428 --> 21:37.364
IF I HAD TO START
ALL OVER AGAIN,

21:37.464 --> 21:39.165
LYING TO SOMEBODY
FOR A YEAR.

21:39.265 --> 21:41.634
I DON'T WANT
TO FEEL STUPID.

21:44.404 --> 21:46.439
WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO FEEL?

21:47.874 --> 21:50.943
I JUST WANT TO FEEL--

21:55.281 --> 21:57.717
OF COURSE
I'LL SEE YOU.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.354
ARE YOU SURE?

22:01.454 --> 22:05.392
MM-HMM, I'M SURE.

22:24.544 --> 22:26.646
IS THIS TIME GOOD?

22:26.746 --> 22:28.681
YES, IT IS.

22:33.119 --> 22:35.522
( music playing )
