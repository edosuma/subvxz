WEBVTT

00:07.257 --> 00:08.216
Come on, boy!

00:11.177 --> 00:12.387
Come on. Come on.

00:13.596 --> 00:14.514
They got a scent!

00:30.739 --> 00:32.657
I heard dogs, Eddie! They got dogs!

00:35.535 --> 00:36.828
Dolly, what are you doing?

00:37.746 --> 00:39.039
What are you looking at?

00:39.122 --> 00:41.458
We gotta strip! Throw 'em off our scent.

00:42.625 --> 00:43.460
Really?

00:43.543 --> 00:45.420
Yes, you didn't know that?

00:45.503 --> 00:47.130
I've seen it in, like, a million movies.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.340
Hurry up, take your pants off!

00:49.799 --> 00:50.675
Okay.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.637
- Hurry.
- Yeah.

01:32.967 --> 01:33.927
Come on.

01:41.976 --> 01:43.394
It's deserted.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.313
Yes! Yes, come on.

01:50.985 --> 01:52.112
<i>Oh, Edmund.</i>

01:53.029 --> 01:54.030
<i>What have you done?</i>

03:01.764 --> 03:03.224
Would you mind giving us a minute?

03:41.387 --> 03:42.972
I have a confession to make.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.477
I haven't been honest with you.

03:48.686 --> 03:50.813
I haven't been able to tell you the truth.

03:52.857 --> 03:54.859
The truth about who I really am.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.697
Deep down, I know I've wanted to...

04:00.865 --> 04:03.284
but it's something I've never told anyone.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.789
Something I've never wanted
to tell anyone.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.000
Until now.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.131
But the thought that I might lose you...

04:17.840 --> 04:21.135
I can't keep lying to you.
I have to tell you the truth.

04:24.555 --> 04:25.390
Gwendolyn.

04:26.766 --> 04:27.642
Nurse!

04:27.725 --> 04:29.060
Nurse!

04:29.811 --> 04:30.645
Get the doctor.

04:30.728 --> 04:31.729
She's awake.

04:35.566 --> 04:37.610
No, no, no. Shh, don't speak, don't speak.

04:39.153 --> 04:41.322
You're going to be all right.

04:42.490 --> 04:43.700
You just stay with me.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.177
Seems like they left in a hurry.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.765
Uh... Gross.

06:31.432 --> 06:33.810
Well, they all did in the Depression.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.813
When the banks took over people's farms,

06:36.896 --> 06:40.149
they hired actual thugs and goons
to throw you out.

06:41.651 --> 06:44.278
Then all those trashy Okies
started showing up.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.491
Some people just starved.

06:49.325 --> 06:50.576
Their animals, too.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.995
-I wonder if there are bones around here.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.957
You got a taste for the macabre,
don't you, Dolly?

06:57.417 --> 06:58.251
Give me that.

07:01.671 --> 07:04.298
Don't you understand?
This is killer-diller good luck.

07:04.799 --> 07:05.925
Like Bonnie and Clyde.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.595
Your teeth are chattering.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.140
Are you scared?

07:12.223 --> 07:13.182
Of course not.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.185
I'm cold and hungry, aren't you?

07:16.936 --> 07:18.563
I'll make you warm.

07:19.897 --> 07:21.315
First things first, Dolly.

07:21.732 --> 07:23.526
We gotta find a gun or something.

07:23.609 --> 07:25.903
Those bloodhounds are gonna pick up
our scent sooner or later.

07:26.487 --> 07:28.322
I don't know why you're so worried.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.742
I hate to tell you this, Dolly,
but you can't outrun bloodhounds,

07:31.826 --> 07:33.286
and that's just a fact.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.037
We just slowed them down.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.497
What do you mean?

07:36.581 --> 07:38.499
I saw it in that Jane Russell movie.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.461
Yeah, I knowÂ they like that bullshit
in the movies.

07:41.544 --> 07:42.879
This is real life.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.092
You were so sure, it was sweet.

07:50.261 --> 07:51.929
I didn't wanna burst your bubble.

07:59.061 --> 07:59.979
Burst my bubble?

08:03.024 --> 08:05.151
You know what I think would be adorable?

08:05.234 --> 08:07.403
Why don't you sweep up this rat shit?

08:08.571 --> 08:10.573
Or are you too busy
having your hissy fit?

08:11.532 --> 08:12.366
Hey.

08:13.993 --> 08:16.287
Hey, did you find anything to eat
in these cupboards?

08:16.370 --> 08:17.455
You got eyes?

08:26.631 --> 08:27.882
Oh. Oh.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.093
Hey.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.554
Know how to cook tomatoes?

08:34.347 --> 08:35.598
Come on, Dolly.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.476
Holy Toledo, Dolly, put it down.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.774
That was just sitting up there?

08:44.857 --> 08:48.194
My grandma used to keep her shotgun
on the beam above her bed too.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.279
She wasn't scared of nobody.

08:51.113 --> 08:52.240
That thing loaded?

09:01.791 --> 09:03.334
-Could have killed me.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.294
Don't be so serious.

09:05.878 --> 09:08.464
You gotta admit, you pointed a gun
and pulled the trigger at someone

09:08.548 --> 09:09.590
not too many hours ago.

09:10.841 --> 09:12.301
We already discussed that.

09:13.010 --> 09:14.428
You slit Harold's throat.

09:14.887 --> 09:17.223
You see me acting
like you're going to kill me?

09:18.432 --> 09:20.601
I thought you liked being scared, anyways.

09:21.477 --> 09:22.311
Which is it?

09:24.313 --> 09:26.816
Quit making such a big deal
out of everything.

09:26.899 --> 09:27.817
Just drop it.

09:28.609 --> 09:30.486
You kind of scare <i>me,</i> Dolly.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.405
I scare <i>you?</i>

09:33.864 --> 09:34.782
Here's the truth.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.207
I'm probably the least scary man
you ever met.

09:46.377 --> 09:47.837
What's that supposed to mean?

09:50.339 --> 09:51.299
I don't know.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.427
I don't know, you're right, let's drop it.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.846
We're stuck with each other anyways.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.202
Whatcha doing, Dolly?

10:20.870 --> 10:22.955
I'm not sleeping in that rat shit house.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.418
Can I sleep here too?

10:29.503 --> 10:30.546
Don't act stupid.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.382
Don't call me stupid.

10:34.759 --> 10:35.718
You still love me?

10:37.136 --> 10:39.305
Why do you think
I'm making this bed for us?

10:40.890 --> 10:42.308
I'm trying to be romantic.

10:46.812 --> 10:47.647
Hey.

10:50.858 --> 10:53.235
I want to kiss you so bad,
it's driving me crazy.

10:54.528 --> 10:55.363
I love you.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.611
You're a wild woman, Dolly.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.158
Never would have figured that.

12:22.241 --> 12:23.159
Mm.

12:24.785 --> 12:25.745
Me neither.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.417
I imagined that I was Jane Russell.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.503
Not exactly imagined. It was still me.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.174
But I was imagining how she'd be,

12:38.257 --> 12:39.759
if she felt like me.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.053
She'd just act like she felt.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.642
I love you so much.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.730
You're my beautiful magic man.

12:56.066 --> 12:57.109
We're magic.

13:08.454 --> 13:09.747
Poor little fella.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.707
Now that's a survivor.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.668
-You know how I feel right now?
-Mm.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.379
I'm hungry enough to eat that rooster.

13:18.839 --> 13:20.549
Do you know how to cook a rooster?

13:20.800 --> 13:23.552
Yeah, sure. I'll make a fire.

13:24.011 --> 13:26.430
Clean one of those pots, boil some water.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.601
I'll throw in those stewed tomatoes.

13:30.684 --> 13:33.729
You just have to catch him first,
and wring his neck and pluck him.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.360
You want me to kill him?

13:40.528 --> 13:41.821
I mean, well, yeah.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.781
You've never killed a chicken before?

13:45.658 --> 13:46.992
I mean, it's no big deal.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.328
Poor guy survived this long only to be--

13:49.411 --> 13:50.788
Shit, Eddie.

13:51.705 --> 13:54.708
You can kill four priests
and slit a nice guy's throat,

13:54.792 --> 13:57.127
but you can't kill a chicken to feed us?

13:57.211 --> 13:58.212
It was your idea.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.090
That chicken never had a mean thought.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.009
It never did one bad thing.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.845
Animals are not like people.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.306
Well, I suggest
you watch and learn,

14:09.390 --> 14:12.059
because you're gonna have to do it
next time.

14:26.490 --> 14:29.827
So you grab it by the feet,
so it's upside down like this.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.831
And then you take the first finger

14:33.914 --> 14:36.458
and second finger of your right hand here,

14:36.542 --> 14:39.169
and you put your thumb
under its little beak,

14:39.295 --> 14:41.630
and you tilt...

14:42.756 --> 14:44.633
-and snap...

14:44.717 --> 14:46.719
-and Bob's your uncle.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.013
And that's just his nervous system.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.222
He's dead.

14:50.639 --> 14:51.807
He's not in any pain.

14:55.394 --> 14:56.270
Really?

14:56.812 --> 14:58.022
You couldn't watch me?

14:58.814 --> 15:00.316
I'm okay.

15:01.525 --> 15:02.693
I'll clean him, just...

15:03.777 --> 15:04.778
show me how.

15:06.238 --> 15:08.324
<i>Hey there, boys and girls.</i>

15:08.407 --> 15:10.618
Ow.

15:11.201 --> 15:12.077
Hi.

15:14.622 --> 15:16.832
The doctor tells me
you're out of the woods.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.043
How do you feel?

15:19.960 --> 15:21.128
Like I've been shot.

15:22.546 --> 15:24.381
I don't recommend it.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.091
Thank you.

15:26.592 --> 15:27.676
Well, you look good.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.178
No, I don't.

15:29.637 --> 15:30.721
But thank you.

15:33.599 --> 15:34.516
Ow.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.645
Every time I laugh,

15:37.728 --> 15:41.148
it feels like I'm being stabbed
in the chest with a hot poker.

15:41.857 --> 15:43.359
At least I'm laughing.

15:44.652 --> 15:45.694
So that's something.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.825
<i>Wanna know my favorite animal?</i>

15:51.909 --> 15:52.993
<i>I sure do.</i>

15:53.577 --> 15:56.205
- <i>My favorite animal goes, "Woof."</i>
<i>-</i>Nurse?

15:56.580 --> 15:58.374
Miss Briggs is not a child.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.960
Would you please find her
some age-appropriate programming?

16:01.043 --> 16:02.086
Oh, no, please.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.629
I asked her to put it on.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.049
Makes me feel like a kid.

16:08.258 --> 16:09.885
I've always loved puppets.

16:11.553 --> 16:12.388
Thank you.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.223
<i>Can you tell me</i>
<i>what animal that was?</i>

16:14.306 --> 16:15.224
<i>Oh, I know.</i>

16:15.724 --> 16:16.684
<i>It was a duck.</i>

16:17.017 --> 16:17.851
<i>That's right.</i>

16:17.935 --> 16:19.561
Would you care to have a seat?

16:20.771 --> 16:22.022
I could use some company.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.150
<i>I know another animal.</i>

16:25.943 --> 16:28.696
<i>What sound does your animal</i>
<i>that you're thinking of make?</i>

16:28.779 --> 16:30.990
<i>This animal goes,</i>
<i>"Cheep, cheep, cheep."</i>

16:31.073 --> 16:31.991
There was a...

16:34.660 --> 16:37.955
a little puppet theater in the basement
of the house I grew up in.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.083
You don't say.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.004
Some kids have all the luck.

16:48.799 --> 16:49.842
Are you all right?

17:00.352 --> 17:01.186
I am now.

17:19.371 --> 17:20.831
I don't understand.

17:20.914 --> 17:21.999
Well, I...

17:24.251 --> 17:27.713
I told the governor that
I would meet him in Stockton

17:27.796 --> 17:29.840
tomorrow morning for a campaign stop,

17:29.923 --> 17:33.552
but the doctor told me
I'm not allowed to drive myself yet.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.512
So I thought...

17:36.055 --> 17:37.514
if you would be so kind...

17:38.932 --> 17:40.642
Modesto is right on the way.

17:41.560 --> 17:45.064
We could see a marionette show
and have a nice dinner afterwards.

17:47.649 --> 17:48.984
Make an evening of it.

17:49.568 --> 17:50.736
Maybe even a...

17:53.197 --> 17:54.031
an overnight.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.660
You could hold on to my car and...

17:59.286 --> 18:02.664
drive it back here by tomorrow's rounds.

18:03.540 --> 18:04.500
What do you think?

18:12.674 --> 18:14.009
I don't want to do that.

18:18.013 --> 18:19.431
Oh. Well...

18:21.100 --> 18:22.267
Well, then, forget it.

18:25.938 --> 18:26.980
Just an idea.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.574
I mean the puppet show.

18:39.993 --> 18:42.788
I don't see why we would want to do
something like that.

18:43.580 --> 18:46.083
Because I thought it would be fun,
Mildred.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.000
That's all.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.460
Yes, but we're not children.

18:48.585 --> 18:50.045
Well, you know what?

18:50.337 --> 18:51.421
Sometimes...

18:52.464 --> 18:53.632
I wish that we were.

18:55.467 --> 18:59.471
I wish that I could've met Mildred Ratched
before the world got to her.

19:01.431 --> 19:04.309
Before somebody convinced her
that the only way to survive

19:04.393 --> 19:06.311
is to build a wall around herself...

19:07.855 --> 19:09.189
and never let anybody in.

19:10.732 --> 19:11.567
Ever.

19:14.194 --> 19:16.530
I'm sorry, I think you misunderstand.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.866
Actually, I think I understand perfectly.

19:21.285 --> 19:24.037
And I can't do this anymore.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.539
This little...

19:26.498 --> 19:28.250
I don't even know what to call it.

19:28.792 --> 19:31.295
This little game of cat and mouse.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.382
It's obvious that what I have to offer...

19:36.967 --> 19:38.218
you're not interested in.

19:40.220 --> 19:41.180
And that's fine.

19:41.930 --> 19:42.764
But...

19:45.434 --> 19:47.102
life is just too short.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.480
And nearly dying, um...

19:52.107 --> 19:54.484
...is very illuminating
in that regard, so...

19:57.779 --> 20:00.741
So Mildred, I'm sorry
for having wasted your time.

20:02.784 --> 20:05.829
And I guess I'll have to forgive you
for having wasted mine.

20:16.465 --> 20:17.591
I'll go.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.509
I'll go with you.

20:20.719 --> 20:21.637
I want to.

20:23.013 --> 20:24.056
You're right, it...

20:25.265 --> 20:26.350
sounds fun.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.396
You...

20:34.316 --> 20:35.943
You getting hurt...

20:37.861 --> 20:38.737
and almost...

20:41.657 --> 20:43.784
It was very illuminating for me, too.

20:46.286 --> 20:47.162
Yes?

20:47.663 --> 20:49.331
I didn't want to lose you.

20:51.875 --> 20:54.878
So I'm happy to do
whatever you want to do.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.179
That would make me so happy.

21:09.935 --> 21:11.979
I just have to go home and pack a bag.

21:14.856 --> 21:16.108
We can leave around noon.

21:24.408 --> 21:25.534
Oh.

21:25.617 --> 21:26.994
It's charming, isn't it?

21:27.494 --> 21:28.328
Sure.

21:50.892 --> 21:52.060
Mwah, mwah, mwah!

21:52.144 --> 21:55.022
Oh, hello, boys and girls!

21:55.105 --> 21:59.192
Are you ready for my puppet friends
to tell you a story?

21:59.276 --> 22:01.570
- Yes!
- Oh, good, good, good, good, good.

22:01.653 --> 22:04.573
Now, my puppet friends need you
to be good listeners.

22:04.656 --> 22:07.868
So, when you hear something funny,
what do you do?

22:08.243 --> 22:09.161
Laugh.

22:09.244 --> 22:10.704
Yes, you're gonna laugh.

22:10.787 --> 22:11.997
This is so much fun.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.665
Thank you for coming with me.

22:13.749 --> 22:17.294
And when you see
something sad, what do you do?

22:17.377 --> 22:18.503
Cry.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.255
Very good.

22:22.132 --> 22:23.383
And now...

22:25.761 --> 22:27.387
...the story of a brother and a sister

22:27.471 --> 22:30.766
who lose their mommy and daddy
and go on a great adventure.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.227
Once upon a time,

22:34.311 --> 22:37.272
there was a little girl
who grew up in the Great Depression,

22:37.356 --> 22:39.608
whose mommy drank
until she was blackout drunk.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.277
Mommy woke up one day and said...

22:42.736 --> 22:44.613
"I don't want to be a mommy anymore."

22:46.615 --> 22:48.950
So the little girl was sent
to a foster home...

22:50.911 --> 22:53.872
<i>where someone else's mommy and daddy</i>
<i>would take care of her.</i>

22:56.917 --> 22:58.293
What's your name?

22:58.794 --> 22:59.669
Mildred.

23:01.004 --> 23:01.922
<i>Mildred.</i>

23:04.674 --> 23:07.219
I don't ever want to hear
your mouth open again, girl.

23:09.429 --> 23:11.515
This mommy and daddy were very mean.

23:11.598 --> 23:15.185
Whatever Mildred did,
they would beat her and yell at her,

23:15.268 --> 23:17.479
as well as the other orphan
they took care of.

23:29.324 --> 23:30.200
What's your name?

23:31.034 --> 23:31.910
Edmund.

23:35.205 --> 23:36.373
Hi, Edmund.

23:37.290 --> 23:38.458
Hi, Mildred.

23:42.129 --> 23:44.423
No talking.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.967
-It's okay. No, no, don't!

23:51.430 --> 23:53.348
The boy and girl were very unhappy,

23:53.432 --> 23:54.933
until one day,

23:55.725 --> 23:57.686
<i>they met their fairy godmother.</i>

24:05.026 --> 24:06.695
- <i>A kind caseworker...</i>

24:07.863 --> 24:09.906
<i>who pitied the boy and girl so much,</i>

24:09.990 --> 24:11.908
she fudged their paperwork,

24:11.992 --> 24:14.244
<i>writing that</i>
<i>they were biological siblings...</i>

24:16.997 --> 24:19.249
<i>so that they would never be separated,</i>

24:19.332 --> 24:21.209
<i>and they would always have one another.</i>

24:22.711 --> 24:24.671
-She said...
-Be a good boy and girl,

24:25.380 --> 24:27.215
and take care of each other.

24:28.133 --> 24:31.428
But each foster home they were sent to
was worse than the next.

24:33.430 --> 24:34.848
You're my brother.

24:34.931 --> 24:36.516
And you're my sister now.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.143
It's very nice to meet you.

24:38.268 --> 24:39.603
Nice to meet you, too.

24:40.645 --> 24:41.897
What? Ow!

24:43.690 --> 24:47.152
No matter how well they behaved,
their foster parents hated them,

24:47.235 --> 24:49.029
and beat them whenever they could.

24:49.529 --> 24:52.616
- What?! Ow!
- Hey! Stop that, you!

24:57.746 --> 25:01.041
Seems they were often just taken in
for the government stipend they received.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.418
What? No! Stop! No!

25:03.502 --> 25:05.712
One day, the boy was beaten so badly,

25:05.795 --> 25:08.089
-his sister thought he might die.
- No!

25:08.173 --> 25:10.258
-Don't! Stop it!
- Ow!

25:10.342 --> 25:11.301
So they ran away,

25:11.927 --> 25:13.386
<i>back to the caseworker,</i>

25:13.470 --> 25:16.264
<i>and begged her to find them</i>
<i>a mommy and daddy who would love them</i>

25:16.348 --> 25:18.016
<i>and take care of them.</i>

25:18.266 --> 25:21.645
<i>Well, that kind caseworker</i>
<i>took pity on them once again,</i>

25:21.728 --> 25:23.438
and had very good news.

25:23.522 --> 25:26.191
She had found their forever family.

25:27.192 --> 25:31.446
<i>A wealthy mommy and daddy</i>
<i>who lived in a house big as a castle.</i>

25:32.197 --> 25:37.869
Mildred and Edmund were so overjoyed
to meet their new mommy and daddy.

25:44.459 --> 25:47.587
They gave them presents and candy,

25:47.671 --> 25:49.965
and all the ice cream they could eat.

25:58.390 --> 26:02.394
Later, they showed the boy and girl
the best thing of all.

26:03.144 --> 26:07.190
Down in the basement,
there was a puppet theater,

26:07.274 --> 26:10.402
where the boy and girl could play
to their hearts' content.

26:12.612 --> 26:15.532
-After a while, they realized...

26:15.615 --> 26:17.659
...the stage wasn't made for puppets.

26:17.742 --> 26:20.370
They were the ones
who were expected to perform.

26:22.205 --> 26:23.665
Their forever mommy and daddy

26:23.748 --> 26:27.544
<i>took out classified ads in newspapers</i>
<i>using a special code.</i>

26:29.212 --> 26:31.506
I'd like to place an advertisement.

26:31.590 --> 26:35.010
Baby Bloom. Wednesdays at 8:00 p.m.

26:35.093 --> 26:37.679
565 Westerfield Lane.

26:37.762 --> 26:42.017
And perverts from all around
paid lots of money to watch them perform

26:42.100 --> 26:45.395
-unnatural acts on each other.

27:28.688 --> 27:30.940
The boy and girl decided
they had to escape,

27:31.024 --> 27:33.568
but the little boy didn't want
to just run away.

27:35.528 --> 27:37.572
They have to pay for what they've done.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.741
His sister begged him not to,

27:39.824 --> 27:41.951
that they should run off
while they had the chance.

27:42.035 --> 27:44.871
- No, come with me.
- But the little boy said...

27:44.954 --> 27:45.830
No.

27:46.289 --> 27:47.165
<i>And so,</i>

27:47.832 --> 27:49.209
while the couple slept...

27:50.001 --> 27:53.213
he took a pair of razor-sharp scissors...

27:56.424 --> 27:58.009
and gouged out their eyes.

28:11.272 --> 28:13.233
Edmund, we have to get out of here!

28:15.777 --> 28:18.238
Edmund, please.
We have to get out of here.

28:18.321 --> 28:19.823
I don't want to leave you!

28:24.744 --> 28:25.954
Get out of here!

28:39.801 --> 28:41.428
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

28:41.511 --> 28:43.430
Sorry. So sorry. I'm so sorry.

28:43.513 --> 28:46.307
The little girl ran and ran
until she couldn't run anymore.

28:46.391 --> 28:47.767
I'm sorry, Edmund.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.477
I'm sorry.

28:49.811 --> 28:53.189
Finally, she sat down
beneath a tree and cried.

28:54.983 --> 28:57.569
I told you I'd never leave you, but I did.

28:58.820 --> 29:00.071
I did leave you.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.782
Please forgive me, Edmund.

29:03.199 --> 29:06.286
I promise I will come
and find you someday.

29:06.369 --> 29:07.370
I promise!

29:09.789 --> 29:10.957
How dare you!

29:13.752 --> 29:16.629
How dare you force these children
to watch this show?

29:16.713 --> 29:18.214
What kind of place is this?

29:18.298 --> 29:19.174
Mildred.

29:19.257 --> 29:20.216
How dare you!

29:20.800 --> 29:21.885
How dare you!

29:21.968 --> 29:22.802
Mildred.

29:26.848 --> 29:28.808
-What's that?

29:32.479 --> 29:33.313
So sorry.

29:33.396 --> 29:34.981
I'm so, so sorry.

29:48.620 --> 29:51.080
Do you want to talk about
what happened back there?

29:54.918 --> 29:56.836
I suppose I should apologize.

29:58.129 --> 29:59.172
Pull over, please.

29:59.506 --> 30:00.340
What?

30:01.758 --> 30:03.051
Stop the car, Mildred.

30:16.898 --> 30:19.692
You need to tell me
what is going on with you,

30:20.318 --> 30:22.529
and I know you want to talk to me
about it.

30:23.404 --> 30:24.572
I heard you, you know.

30:25.990 --> 30:28.159
In the hospital
after I came out of surgery.

30:29.577 --> 30:30.954
You were holding my hand,

30:32.038 --> 30:34.624
and you said there was something
you had to tell me.

30:37.168 --> 30:38.002
So tell me.

30:39.546 --> 30:40.380
Who are you?

30:46.427 --> 30:48.096
<i>As a child, I was...</i>

30:48.847 --> 30:51.099
well, I suppose you'd say I was an orphan.

30:54.185 --> 30:56.354
And I was placed into the foster system.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.107
I had a brother.

31:01.192 --> 31:02.944
Well, he wasn't really my brother.

31:05.321 --> 31:06.823
He was also an orphan.

31:09.784 --> 31:12.370
But a caseworker
took a liking to us and...

31:13.621 --> 31:16.624
forged our paperwork
to say that we were...

31:17.292 --> 31:20.128
biological siblings,
so we would be kept together.

31:29.554 --> 31:30.847
One of the families...

31:33.725 --> 31:34.684
the last one...

31:40.023 --> 31:41.065
They abused us.

31:44.569 --> 31:47.989
Most of the families... abused us.

31:52.452 --> 31:53.620
But this one...

31:56.873 --> 31:57.999
This man and...

32:01.628 --> 32:03.046
and his wife...

32:09.010 --> 32:11.137
They forced my brother and I...

32:12.472 --> 32:16.100
to perform sexual acts on one another.

32:24.150 --> 32:25.318
After a time...

32:27.070 --> 32:29.030
I'm not exactly sure how long...

32:31.699 --> 32:32.867
Maybe months.

32:34.661 --> 32:35.995
My brother and I...

32:37.246 --> 32:39.040
We decided we had to escape.

32:43.920 --> 32:44.921
But first...

32:46.923 --> 32:48.675
he decided he had to kill them.

32:51.636 --> 32:52.512
And he did.

32:55.682 --> 32:57.558
And he told me to run.

32:59.268 --> 33:00.520
And so I did.

33:06.067 --> 33:06.985
I left him there.

33:08.486 --> 33:09.487
I left him behind.

33:13.199 --> 33:14.951
So I made a promise to myself...

33:16.327 --> 33:18.621
that one day, I would find him.

33:22.917 --> 33:24.377
And now I finally have.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.757
He's a patient at Lucia State Hospital.

33:33.761 --> 33:34.804
My brother...

33:36.139 --> 33:37.765
is Edmund Tolleson.

33:54.157 --> 33:56.159
Dolly, get up.

33:56.242 --> 33:57.285
We overslept.

34:02.373 --> 34:03.791
What do you mean?

34:04.125 --> 34:05.793
We don't got anywhere to be.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.296
On the move is where we gotta be.

34:08.963 --> 34:10.631
You think they're just gonna...

34:10.715 --> 34:13.009
You think they're just gonna
give up looking for us?

34:14.719 --> 34:15.762
I heard something.

34:16.262 --> 34:17.513
I don't hear anything.

34:21.642 --> 34:23.478
What about some eggs first?

34:23.978 --> 34:25.146
We don't got any eggs.

34:25.229 --> 34:28.357
Yeah, but there was that rooster
wandering around. I mean...

34:28.900 --> 34:31.110
he's not gonna stick around
an old farmhouse

34:31.194 --> 34:32.820
without a hen to keep him company.

34:32.904 --> 34:35.114
There's no hen, no eggs.

34:40.119 --> 34:42.663
Well, how's about a little loving

34:42.747 --> 34:46.125
before we hit
the First National Bank of Sacramento?

34:52.590 --> 34:53.800
Later. All right?

34:53.883 --> 34:55.134
-Okay.
-Later.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.221
Drop your weapon!

34:58.304 --> 34:59.847
We have you surrounded!

34:59.931 --> 35:01.057
Turn around! Turn around!

35:02.100 --> 35:03.017
Out the back!

35:03.101 --> 35:03.976
Go, go!

35:07.563 --> 35:09.982
Shit! Dolly. In here!

35:10.566 --> 35:11.484
In here. In here.

35:14.570 --> 35:16.614
Where's the gun? Where's the shotgun?

35:16.697 --> 35:18.157
Ah... They have us surrounded.

35:18.241 --> 35:20.701
We're not gonna be able
to shoot our way out of this, Dolly.

35:21.410 --> 35:22.662
Eddie, what do we do?

35:23.704 --> 35:24.539
We go out there.

35:26.624 --> 35:27.875
I gotta turn myself in, baby.

35:28.501 --> 35:30.711
No. No, I won't let you.

35:31.379 --> 35:33.881
-I'll tell them I kidnapped you.
-No! No!

35:33.965 --> 35:35.466
You won't go to jail or nothing.

35:35.550 --> 35:38.344
But I... I shot a woman.

35:38.427 --> 35:39.762
You have to let me go.

35:40.346 --> 35:42.640
It's the only way we don't end up dead.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.059
I don't want to live without you.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.227
Dolly, listen to me.

35:50.314 --> 35:52.692
You've given me more life
than I ever deserved.

35:53.901 --> 35:55.528
I love you so much, Edmund.

35:56.612 --> 35:57.697
I love you, too.

36:00.783 --> 36:02.493
I wanted it all with you, you know?

36:03.703 --> 36:04.662
A house...

36:06.205 --> 36:08.332
babies, and everything.

36:09.208 --> 36:10.293
Don't say it.

36:11.961 --> 36:12.879
Don't say it.

36:14.463 --> 36:16.674
But maybe it was just never in the cards.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.059
I'm unarmed.

36:28.436 --> 36:30.146
Walk real slow, son.

36:30.521 --> 36:31.981
The girl didn't do anything.

36:33.149 --> 36:34.483
I kidnapped her.

36:37.987 --> 36:40.448
You have no right to punish her
for something I did.

36:42.158 --> 36:43.451
It was all my idea.

36:44.368 --> 36:45.536
-No!

36:46.287 --> 36:48.748
-Dolly, no!

36:48.831 --> 36:49.707
-No!

37:10.770 --> 37:12.521
Hold! Hold! Hold your fire!

37:13.773 --> 37:14.732
Everybody, move in!

37:16.776 --> 37:18.277
All right, she's down!

37:21.614 --> 37:22.740
Patrolmen down!

37:27.036 --> 37:29.247
You're gonna rot in hell,
you son of a bitch.

38:19.005 --> 38:20.131
You Nurse Ratched?

38:20.881 --> 38:22.425
Mildred Ratched, Sheriff.

38:22.508 --> 38:24.552
Head nurse. We spoke on the phone.

38:25.261 --> 38:26.429
Sign here, please.

38:27.763 --> 38:28.889
Nurse Ratched.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.225
We'll be taking him down to M ward.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.102
We got armed deputies guarding his cell

38:33.185 --> 38:34.854
until the governor gets here
in the morning.

38:34.937 --> 38:35.771
Good.

38:36.022 --> 38:39.150
-Nurse Ratched!
-Don't you dare address me, Mr. Tolleson.

38:39.233 --> 38:42.778
You should thank your lucky stars
these men didn't blow your head off.

38:43.487 --> 38:45.948
It's far more mercy
than I would have shown you.

38:47.450 --> 38:48.284
Get him out of here.

38:49.118 --> 38:50.328
Nurse Ratched!

39:11.140 --> 39:13.476
The governor's here to see you,
Dr. Hanover.

39:14.393 --> 39:15.353
Thank you.

39:16.520 --> 39:18.439
You're looking well today, Nurse Bucket.

39:25.738 --> 39:26.822
Go ahead.

39:28.407 --> 39:32.244
<i>And after just a handful</i>
<i>of sessions of hypnotherapy,</i>

39:32.328 --> 39:35.498
<i>Miss Wells's alternate personalities</i>
<i>all but disappeared.</i>

39:36.374 --> 39:38.793
Here's her chart.
Nurse Ratched, will you please...

39:39.668 --> 39:44.548
And, Governor, you will see
that she is a fascinating case,

39:44.632 --> 39:45.925
and a charismatic one to boot.

39:46.008 --> 39:51.180
Much more the face of this facility
than EdmundÂ Tolleson ever was.

39:52.556 --> 39:53.933
And why are you telling me this?

39:54.392 --> 39:55.267
Well...

39:55.810 --> 39:58.020
as you can see in the... in the chart--

39:58.104 --> 40:01.440
Dr. Hanover is aware that you believe
your campaign to be flagging.

40:01.524 --> 40:02.358
Miss Cratchet--

40:02.441 --> 40:03.609
It's Ratched.

40:04.193 --> 40:05.277
It's Mildred Ratched.

40:07.363 --> 40:12.284
He also knows that Edmund Tolleson is
insane and therefore unfit to stand trial,

40:12.368 --> 40:15.579
but he still believes that
this facility can remain a central part

40:15.663 --> 40:17.248
of your reelection campaign.

40:18.457 --> 40:21.293
-Was I speaking to you?
-You were not, but as head nurse--

40:21.377 --> 40:22.503
Then shut the fuck up!

40:34.140 --> 40:36.517
Worst mass murderer
in the history of the state of California,

40:36.600 --> 40:39.937
and he's allowed to attend a dance
in the same hospital

40:40.020 --> 40:42.398
that I lent my credibility to as governor.

40:43.566 --> 40:44.400
Murders a guard,

40:44.483 --> 40:46.235
shoots my press secretary,

40:46.318 --> 40:48.237
and he escapes with the help
of an accomplice

40:48.320 --> 40:50.448
who's a nurse from the very same hospital!

40:52.366 --> 40:54.493
A statewide manhunt ensues,

40:54.577 --> 40:56.162
and ends in a gunfight

40:56.245 --> 40:58.581
with two patrolmen
and the accomplice dead.

40:58.664 --> 41:00.541
Now, I think I got all my facts straight.

41:02.543 --> 41:03.752
Unless I'm mistaken.

41:03.836 --> 41:07.131
Well, it was the accomplice who shot me,

41:07.214 --> 41:08.382
not Edmund.

41:12.386 --> 41:15.639
Does this seem like a good week
for my reelection campaign?

41:16.724 --> 41:17.766
Hm?

41:18.809 --> 41:20.769
Dr. Hanover, our relationship is over.

41:21.520 --> 41:23.272
I can only hope that
the voters of this state

41:23.355 --> 41:26.400
thought making my campaign
about the war on mental illness

41:26.484 --> 41:30.070
as stupid an idea as I did,
and they forget it ever happened.

41:31.572 --> 41:33.908
So if you want your hospital to stay open,

41:33.991 --> 41:36.744
if you want one more penny
of state funding

41:36.827 --> 41:39.538
to provide treatment
for your patients here...

41:39.622 --> 41:40.789
Miss Briggs.

41:40.873 --> 41:42.416
...you will sign this release

41:43.417 --> 41:45.753
saying that Tolleson is sane.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.089
Fit to stand trial.

42:04.688 --> 42:05.564
Dr. Hanover.

42:07.024 --> 42:08.275
Yes.

42:11.612 --> 42:13.989
Now. See, that wasn't so hard, was it?

42:14.990 --> 42:15.950
No.

42:18.869 --> 42:21.205
Now, I sincerely hope
I never meet you again.

42:22.998 --> 42:23.832
Doctor.

42:24.542 --> 42:25.376
Miss Briggs.

42:26.877 --> 42:29.964
You know, I gotta say, when we first met,
everybody said that you were brilliant.

42:30.047 --> 42:32.299
But that's not what I thought.
I said to myself,

42:32.383 --> 42:35.511
"This motherfucker, he's the crazy one."

42:36.387 --> 42:38.180
That just goes to show you,

42:38.264 --> 42:40.307
first impressions, they're never wrong.

42:59.076 --> 43:00.327
Governor, I'm impressed.

43:00.411 --> 43:01.245
How so?

43:01.328 --> 43:04.748
At your being brave enough to keep
this facility open after what happened.

43:04.832 --> 43:07.001
-You're dumber than you look.
-I'm sorry?

43:07.084 --> 43:10.129
I pulled the funding.
This hospital will be bankrupt in a month.

43:10.212 --> 43:12.298
I lied to him so he'd sign the release.

43:12.381 --> 43:14.592
Edmund Tolleson will be
frying in the electric chair

43:14.675 --> 43:16.176
by Monday of next week.

43:17.845 --> 43:21.599
-I see. You know, it occurs to me, um,

43:21.682 --> 43:25.227
now that he's in custody
and we know he's going to be put to death,

43:25.311 --> 43:29.398
maybe his execution is something
we could tease to the voters.

43:30.024 --> 43:31.984
We could put it off
until after the election

43:32.067 --> 43:36.071
and let the public's interest in the case
motivate them to turn out to the polls.

43:36.905 --> 43:38.574
You have a nice ass...

43:39.283 --> 43:40.534
but you know that, right?

43:41.452 --> 43:42.786
It's the mouth.

43:43.871 --> 43:48.208
I am so tired of hearing
bullshit advice spewing from it.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.754
Miss Briggs, you're fired.

43:55.591 --> 43:56.925
Sorry you got shot.
