00:01.827 --> 00:02.994
So you got a prescription

00:02.996 --> 00:04.496
for hydrocodone from Dr. Sacani?

00:04.498 --> 00:05.464
Yes.

00:05.466 --> 00:06.765
Then you used that up,

00:06.767 --> 00:08.634

to the Bellport pain clinic.

00:08.636 --> 00:11.136
I had undiagnosed radicular pain

00:11.138 --> 00:13.555

a prescribed medication.

- Okay.

02:11.425 --> 02:12.641
Where have you been recently?

02:12.643 --> 02:14.142
I spent most of the summer in Florida

02:14.144 --> 02:16.795
doing the initial assembly of the bones.

02:16.797 --> 02:19.765
But last week, I did
a raptor dig in North Dakota.

02:19.767 --> 02:22.317
Lots of time outdoors, I assume.

02:22.319 --> 02:23.568
I slept in a sleeping bag.

02:23.570 --> 02:24.686
Wouldn't that keep the problem out?

02:24.688 --> 02:26.438
Maybe, or keep it in.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.157
Huh. Well, I left the bag behind.

02:29.159 --> 02:31.743
But when I got home, I got the rash.

02:31.745 --> 02:33.745
Well, they don't look too alarming.

02:33.747 --> 02:35.330
I'll do a scraping to test for scabies

02:35.332 --> 02:37.916

No.

04:21.971 --> 04:24.723
to me or to Hank.

04:24.725 --> 04:27.309
But I have a theory.

04:27.311 --> 04:30.111
What is your theory?

04:30.113 --> 04:31.429
Divya overheard me telling Paige

04:31.431 --> 04:34.783
about your feelings for her.

04:44.043 --> 04:47.779
Is that a good theory?

the ancient skeleton bit him.

really need to be that sharp?

Well, in fairness to Emma,

05:45.505 --> 05:46.888
she hasn't eaten in 65 million years.

05:46.890 --> 05:48.106

your expectations,

Huh. Another Hungarian psycho at large?

10:38.499 --> 10:40.449
No, Boris is in town for the weekend.

10:40.451 --> 10:41.500
But we can move back in once he leaves.

10:41.502 --> 10:44.720
Until we have to vacate again.

10:44.722 --> 10:46.055
The price of not having our own home.

10:46.057 --> 10:48.140
She keeps bringing it up. It's so funny.

10:48.142 --> 10:50.626
Not really.

10:50.628 --> 10:52.761
How comfortable for me.
Anyone need a drink?

10:52.763 --> 10:54.480
- No, I'm good.
- I'm all right.

10:54.482 --> 10:56.798
So do I.

11:04.241 --> 11:05.441
[Baby cries]

11:05.443 --> 11:07.026
He's learning
how to use that stethoscope

11:07.028 --> 11:08.911
faster than I did.

11:08.913 --> 11:10.312
Do you think Carlos will ask

11:10.314 --> 11:11.813
to see her again in six months?

11:11.815 --> 11:14.333
[Laughs]

11:14.335 --> 11:17.286
So Marisa found
a real clinical trial for you

11:17.288 --> 11:19.371
while planning a fake one for Milos?

11:19.373 --> 11:22.291
- Yep.
- Nothing shocks me anymore.

11:22.293 --> 11:24.493
I appreciate the irony, believe me,

11:24.495 --> 11:26.095
and the good fortune.

11:26.097 --> 11:27.963
I have not yet been cleared though

11:27.965 --> 11:30.332
to begin my treatment.

11:30.334 --> 11:31.500
Well, I'll rush the blood

11:31.502 --> 11:32.334
and have everything ready tomorrow.

11:32.336 --> 11:33.719
Thank you, Hank.

11:33.721 --> 11:35.688
The exam isn't the only reason
I called you though.

11:35.690 --> 11:38.557
Does Carlos want a job at Hankmed?

11:38.559 --> 11:42.344
Perhaps.
[Sighs]

11:42.346 --> 11:44.063
<i>Mi amor.</i>

11:45.532 --> 11:48.484
I have decided to take stock

11:48.486 --> 11:52.288
of my properties and assets...

11:52.290 --> 11:55.324
And begin to divest them.

11:55.326 --> 11:57.910
Wow. That sounds like a big step.

11:57.912 --> 11:59.295
It is.

11:59.297 --> 12:01.630
But after all the events
of this past year,

12:01.632 --> 12:03.031
it's time to leave the past behind

12:03.033 --> 12:04.800
and focus on the future.

12:04.802 --> 12:08.671
I want to simplify my life, Hank.

12:08.673 --> 12:10.172
I understand the way you feel.

12:10.174 --> 12:13.892
The chief investigator
of the clinical trial agreed

12:13.894 --> 12:15.844
I would be able to travel as necessary

12:15.846 --> 12:17.596
to take care of everything.

12:17.598 --> 12:19.881
If there is continuity of care.

12:19.883 --> 12:21.900
Yes.

12:21.902 --> 12:23.736
I volunteered,

12:23.738 --> 12:27.439
but family members are not
permitted to provide care.

12:27.441 --> 12:29.525
- Aha.
- So...

12:29.527 --> 12:32.194
Guys, I'm flattered. Truly, I am, but...

12:32.196 --> 12:33.412
Ah, you see? I told you.

12:33.414 --> 12:35.164
You can't take Hank out of Hankmed

12:35.166 --> 12:37.249
and drag him from Paris to Beijing

12:37.251 --> 12:39.585
to Sydney to Moscow.

12:39.587 --> 12:42.204
But I'm happy to help find someone else.

12:42.206 --> 12:43.372
It's not necessary.

12:43.374 --> 12:45.174
We already have a few candidates,

12:45.176 --> 12:47.626
not as universally loved
and trusted as you.

12:47.628 --> 12:49.345
Ah, it's not always so universal.

12:49.347 --> 12:51.847
But still, I can't leave my practice.

12:51.849 --> 12:53.849
You sure?

12:53.851 --> 12:57.636
I'm... I'm sorry, Boris.

12:57.638 --> 13:00.556
No apology necessary, Hank.

13:00.558 --> 13:02.808
I can't expect you
to complicate your life

13:02.810 --> 13:06.094
so that I may simplify mine,

13:06.096 --> 13:09.648
but it was worth a try.

13:18.792 --> 13:20.042
This is a new one for me.

13:20.044 --> 13:21.660
For Emma too.

13:21.662 --> 13:25.614
Doesn't really believe
in going to the doctor.

13:25.616 --> 13:28.133
No internal fracture.
[Sighs]

13:28.135 --> 13:29.418
That's great news.

13:29.420 --> 13:31.453
Emma should still fetch top dollar

13:31.455 --> 13:34.173
for the people of Mongolia.

13:34.175 --> 13:36.725
- Yeah, she should.
- Everything okay?

13:36.727 --> 13:38.794
Nah, you don't wanna hear
about my travails

13:38.796 --> 13:39.845
in the dinosaur business.

13:39.847 --> 13:41.013
Actually, I'd love to.

13:41.015 --> 13:42.431
I'm fascinated by what you do.

13:42.433 --> 13:45.484
Well, it's not quite
<i>Jurassic Park,</i> but...

13:45.486 --> 13:47.469
When I started working with dinosaurs,

13:47.471 --> 13:48.904
bone diggers were thieves,

13:48.906 --> 13:51.740
selling to the richest patron
they could find.

13:51.742 --> 13:55.811
I don't really believe
in that kind of paleontology.

13:55.813 --> 13:57.780
These government officials,

13:57.782 --> 13:59.248
oh, they promised
that the profits will go

13:59.250 --> 14:01.667
towards financing
a world-class museum, but...

14:01.669 --> 14:02.918
Now you're having doubts.

14:02.920 --> 14:05.037
I'm doubting whether these particular

14:05.039 --> 14:06.538
Mongolian officials actually serve

14:06.540 --> 14:08.624
the Mongolian people.

14:08.626 --> 14:10.292
What, you think they'll pocket the cash?

14:10.294 --> 14:12.928
Well, the cash seemed
to skip over the museum

14:12.930 --> 14:15.681
on our last venture.

14:15.683 --> 14:16.998
I just believe artifacts like this

14:17.000 --> 14:19.601
should be available for everyone to see,

14:19.603 --> 14:22.271
not just the mega-rich collectors.

14:22.273 --> 14:24.056
[Sighs]
Monique?

14:24.058 --> 14:25.607
Are you... are you feeling okay?

14:25.609 --> 14:27.893
Yeah, I'm just a bit tired and sore.

14:27.895 --> 14:30.863
The scraping from your rash
was negative for scabies.

14:30.865 --> 14:34.650
Mm.
[Thermometer beeps]

14:34.652 --> 14:36.869
But now you have a fever.

14:36.871 --> 14:39.405
- Well, what does that mean?
- Probably an infection.

14:39.407 --> 14:41.073
And with your travel,
it could be anything.

14:41.075 --> 14:43.692
- Like what?
- Maybe just a virus.

14:43.694 --> 14:46.044
But it could be tularemia,
which is a bacteria

14:46.046 --> 14:47.546
you can get from digging in dirt.

14:47.548 --> 14:49.248
Oh, well, what are the symptoms?

14:49.250 --> 14:51.383
Fever, lethargy, and skin lesions.

14:51.385 --> 14:53.034
Oh.
[Laughs]

14:53.036 --> 14:54.035
Well, that sounds
like a pretty good guess.

14:54.037 --> 14:55.337
[Laughs]

14:55.339 --> 14:56.972
I'll give you prophylactic antibiotics

14:56.974 --> 14:58.590
to be safe, but I wanna do a blood draw

14:58.592 --> 14:59.725
and a chest X-ray.

14:59.727 --> 15:01.977
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

15:08.184 --> 15:10.269
He's returning constituent emails.

15:10.271 --> 15:13.105
He's been a good sport.
This clearly isn't his scene.

15:13.107 --> 15:17.025
Well, it is mine, but we're leaving.

15:17.027 --> 15:18.160
Before you go, I want your opinion

15:18.162 --> 15:19.611
on choosing my Paris replacement.

15:19.613 --> 15:21.697
Oh, okay.

15:21.699 --> 15:23.332
You have a front-runner in mind?

15:23.334 --> 15:24.950
I do.

15:24.952 --> 15:27.419
And do you have any concerns
about that person?

15:27.421 --> 15:29.955
Just two:

15:29.957 --> 15:32.591
Whether she'd be so cheerful,
she'd force the French to smile,

15:32.593 --> 15:36.178
and whether she could take
a semester off from Parsons

15:36.180 --> 15:37.546
for the job of a lifetime.

15:37.548 --> 15:39.214
You're being serious.

15:39.216 --> 15:41.216
You're the best intern I've ever had.

15:41.218 --> 15:43.084
[Laughs]

15:43.086 --> 15:44.686
I respect you.

15:44.688 --> 15:46.188
I trust you.

15:46.190 --> 15:47.806
Unless you wanna lobby for Kristof,

15:47.808 --> 15:48.857
- who's the runner-up.
- No.

15:48.859 --> 15:52.611
No, no.
[Laughs]

15:52.613 --> 15:54.146
What's going on over here?

15:54.148 --> 15:56.231
Oh, don't sweat it. She's not my type.

15:56.233 --> 15:57.900
- What'd I miss?
- Oh, that.

15:57.902 --> 16:01.119
You and your wife are going
to Paris for a few months.

16:01.121 --> 16:02.488
Perfect timing too.

16:02.490 --> 16:05.240
Nothing like the most
passionate city on earth

16:05.242 --> 16:07.793
to rekindle a troubled romance.

16:13.249 --> 16:14.650
Hmm.

16:18.675 --> 16:21.426
Where are all of Divya's boxes
supposed to go?

16:21.428 --> 16:23.628
Um, anything else you told Russel?

16:23.630 --> 16:26.130
Oh, you don't discuss our
relationship with other people?

16:26.132 --> 16:29.350
You told him it's...
what was the word, "troubled"?

16:29.352 --> 16:31.936
Oh. How unfair of me.

16:31.938 --> 16:33.938
Clearly, this marriage
is just killing it.

16:33.940 --> 16:36.107
Okay, Paige, Paige.

16:36.109 --> 16:38.109
It may not be perfect, but it's ours.

16:38.111 --> 16:39.760
So if you wanna discuss
its imperfections,

16:39.762 --> 16:42.113
please do it with me, okay?

16:42.115 --> 16:44.148
I'm glad Russel said it.

16:44.150 --> 16:45.817
At least it got us
talking about our issues

16:45.819 --> 16:46.868
instead of avoiding them.

16:46.870 --> 16:47.935
What are you talking about?

16:47.937 --> 16:49.070
We haven't been avoiding them at all.

16:49.072 --> 16:50.488
We've been really busy this summer.

16:50.490 --> 16:51.739
Both of us have.

16:51.741 --> 16:53.908
Which is why we should go to Paris.

16:53.910 --> 16:55.326
What's it gonna look like

16:55.328 --> 16:57.212
if I go gallivanting off to Europe

16:57.214 --> 16:58.463
right after getting elected?

16:58.465 --> 17:01.949
Might look like you care about us.

17:01.951 --> 17:04.085
I do care. I care so much.

17:04.087 --> 17:06.287
But you're asking me to...

17:06.289 --> 17:08.089
what, you want me to leave my job

17:08.090 --> 17:09.840
and all my responsibilities behind,

17:09.843 --> 17:12.393
so I can run off to Paris for your job?

17:12.395 --> 17:13.645
I told you,

17:13.646 --> 17:16.631
I... I made promises that I have to keep.

17:20.469 --> 17:21.903
I have to go.

17:21.905 --> 17:24.805
I have to stay.

17:26.308 --> 17:28.276
Thanks for meeting with us.

17:28.278 --> 17:30.078
Course. What are we meeting about?

17:30.080 --> 17:32.080
The fact that you're trying
to replace him.

17:32.082 --> 17:34.332
Divya told you about our chat.

17:34.334 --> 17:36.034
She might have mentioned it, yeah.

17:36.036 --> 17:39.654
Hank, nothing has been
officially decided yet,

17:39.656 --> 17:42.090
but you did put us in a tough spot.

17:42.092 --> 17:43.291
Now the lawyers are trying to figure out

17:43.293 --> 17:44.792
the best course of action.

17:44.794 --> 17:46.878
And until then,
I need to explore my options.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.346
What are the lawyers figuring out?

17:48.348 --> 17:49.931
My client didn't do anything wrong.

17:49.933 --> 17:52.216
He violated his morals clause.

17:52.218 --> 17:55.053
My contract has a morals clause?

17:55.055 --> 17:56.271
I figured with you,

17:56.273 --> 17:57.338
it was the last thing
I had to worry about.

17:57.340 --> 17:58.673
Right, well, you and Shelby

17:58.675 --> 17:59.857
had more important things to agree on.

17:59.859 --> 18:01.842
Hank, I understand that you're angry,

18:01.844 --> 18:03.027
and I'm angry too.

18:03.029 --> 18:05.029
I went to the mat for you,

18:05.031 --> 18:07.282
never expecting that mat
to be out on a limb.

18:07.284 --> 18:08.399
And now my ass is on the line.

18:08.401 --> 18:09.817
So you're scrambling to cover it,

18:09.819 --> 18:11.819
which must be tough,
what with it being on the line

18:11.821 --> 18:13.705
on the mat on the limb.
Did I get that right?

18:13.707 --> 18:15.657
This is about <i>your</i> impropriety.

18:15.659 --> 18:17.158
The appearance of impropriety.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.493
I was treating pain,

18:18.495 --> 18:21.028
and I never compromised
my ability to do my job.

18:21.030 --> 18:23.915
So the hospital administration
is being naive and reactionary.

18:23.917 --> 18:25.466
Just curious, is that what happened

18:25.468 --> 18:26.968
back at Brooklyn Heights Mercy Hospital

18:26.970 --> 18:28.836
before you moved to the Hamptons?

18:28.838 --> 18:31.923
[Exhales]

18:31.925 --> 18:34.092
When you said Symphony was different,

18:34.094 --> 18:35.760
that they put patients first,

18:35.762 --> 18:37.979
you might have also mentioned
that they put doctors last.

18:37.981 --> 18:39.931
You wanna let me go? That's fine.

18:39.933 --> 18:42.266
I'll go back to practicing
the way I did before,

18:42.268 --> 18:43.818
and we'll all be happier.

18:43.820 --> 18:45.687
That'd be nice, but unfortunately,

18:45.689 --> 18:48.189
it's not that simple.

18:48.191 --> 18:50.158
Your contract also has
a non-compete clause.

18:50.160 --> 18:53.244
So you're welcome to go back
to where you were

18:53.246 --> 18:55.830
as long as it's not
within 200 miles of here.

18:58.834 --> 19:02.170
[Device beeps]

19:02.172 --> 19:03.504
Okay.

19:03.506 --> 19:05.039
Russel.

19:05.041 --> 19:06.741
Your nervousness is making me nervous.

19:06.743 --> 19:08.092
You'd be crazy <i>not</i> to be nervous.

19:08.094 --> 19:10.044
Why should we be nervous?

19:10.046 --> 19:11.379
His private client is coming to visit,

19:11.381 --> 19:13.431
the one we hope wins Emma
at the auction.

19:13.433 --> 19:14.549
Oh.

19:14.551 --> 19:15.550
It's not easy marketing a dinosaur.

19:15.552 --> 19:16.634
[Chuckles]

19:16.636 --> 19:19.470
Hey. How did the meeting go?

19:19.472 --> 19:20.972
Not well.

19:20.974 --> 19:23.274
- Sorry to hear that.
- How's it going here?

19:23.276 --> 19:25.610
Russel had too much coffee.

19:25.612 --> 19:27.061
What makes you say that?

19:27.063 --> 19:29.197
[Groans]
I think I've had too much coffee.

19:29.199 --> 19:30.598
Huh.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.067
My client is very serious
about anonymity.

19:33.069 --> 19:36.120
Any chance we can complete
this exam expeditiously?

19:36.122 --> 19:37.205
We rush all our exams.

19:37.207 --> 19:41.042
That's why our patients are so healthy.

19:41.044 --> 19:42.660
Monique, let me have a look.

19:42.662 --> 19:44.912
[Clears throat]

19:44.914 --> 19:46.798
Yeah, your rash is starting to clear up.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.300
No fever,
which means it's not tularemia.

19:49.302 --> 19:50.752
But we're still not sure what it is.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.053
I'm just glad it's not soil.

19:52.055 --> 19:54.305
I love soil,
or at least what I find in it.

19:54.307 --> 19:56.507
For someone who spends
so much time in dirt,

19:56.509 --> 19:57.508
you clean up real nice.

19:57.510 --> 19:58.976
Oh. Thanks.

19:58.978 --> 20:01.062
Well, it's no easy chore.

20:01.064 --> 20:02.230
I have the most overworked loofah

20:02.232 --> 20:05.600
in the Western hemisphere.

20:05.602 --> 20:07.101
Sorry.

20:07.103 --> 20:08.770
No. Monique, can I see your back?

20:08.772 --> 20:11.906
Um, sure.

20:11.908 --> 20:14.692
[Zipper unzips]

20:14.694 --> 20:16.828
Yep.

20:16.830 --> 20:18.863
- Do you scrub right here?
- No.

20:18.865 --> 20:20.998
I'd need trenching equipment
to get to that area.

20:21.000 --> 20:24.285
Monique, how old
is your overworked loofah?

20:24.287 --> 20:26.587
Uh, I don't know.

20:26.589 --> 20:29.791
I mean, it's got quite
a few miles on it, I'm sure.

20:29.793 --> 20:32.176
- Why?
- Because it caused your rash.

20:32.178 --> 20:33.928
Pseudomonas folliculitis.

20:33.930 --> 20:37.265
Sorry, that species is
outside of my biological domain.

20:37.267 --> 20:39.434
It's an infection of the hair follicles

20:39.436 --> 20:42.303
due to bacteria that contaminate
bathing products.

20:42.305 --> 20:45.022
Oh. Prescription.

20:45.024 --> 20:46.474
[Laughs]
New loofah.

20:46.476 --> 20:50.194
Where should I put
these giant dinosaur eggs?

20:50.196 --> 20:51.979
Uh, just over on that side table.

20:51.981 --> 20:55.450
They may be giant,
but Emma still had it easy.

20:55.452 --> 20:56.534
You can hold the nest if you like.

20:56.536 --> 20:59.287
It's just a plaster reproduction.

20:59.289 --> 21:00.988
It's light. Hmm.

21:00.990 --> 21:03.357
[Gasps]

21:03.359 --> 21:05.860
Divya, what's wrong?

21:05.862 --> 21:08.463
I... I don't know.

21:08.465 --> 21:11.332
[Groans]

21:18.672 --> 21:20.021
Obviously, you've been monitoring it.

21:20.023 --> 21:21.606
The intrauterine septum? Yeah.

21:21.608 --> 21:23.141
Since my first ultrasound.

21:23.143 --> 21:24.443
We knew it could cause trouble.

21:24.445 --> 21:25.510
But it hasn't.

21:25.512 --> 21:28.447
Until now.

21:28.449 --> 21:30.282
Until now.

21:30.284 --> 21:31.700
A little English, please?

21:31.702 --> 21:32.951
For all the non-medical loved ones.

21:32.953 --> 21:34.369
Uh, there's a wedge-shaped partition

21:34.371 --> 21:35.454
in her uterine cavity.

21:35.456 --> 21:36.872
That's plenty of English. Thanks.

21:36.874 --> 21:38.123
Okay.

21:38.125 --> 21:41.409
I am seeing something new here.

21:44.130 --> 21:45.914
A sub-chorionic hemorrhage.

21:45.916 --> 21:47.749
Right behind the placenta.

21:47.751 --> 21:49.134
But I don't have any bleeding...

21:49.136 --> 21:52.587
[Groans]
Divya.

21:52.589 --> 21:54.473
The good news is
that it's not an abruption.

21:54.475 --> 21:56.708
Divya, I'll give you Tylenol
for the pain.

21:56.710 --> 22:00.712
But the key is rest
until the cramps subside.

22:00.714 --> 22:03.715
- We'll take turns visiting.
- Yeah.

22:06.402 --> 22:08.320
Jeremiah.

22:08.322 --> 22:10.555
Uh, may I...

22:10.557 --> 22:15.193
Of course. Jeremiah, please come in.

22:15.195 --> 22:16.695
How did you know?

22:16.697 --> 22:18.997
Evan.

22:18.999 --> 22:19.948
Hmm.

22:19.950 --> 22:23.034
Thank you for the call.

22:23.036 --> 22:25.337
Uh, guys, let's let Jeremiah visit.

22:25.339 --> 22:28.039
Yeah.

22:28.041 --> 22:31.593
Bye.

22:36.265 --> 22:37.682
[Sighs]

22:37.684 --> 22:39.935
[Door closes]

22:39.937 --> 22:43.054
How are you feeling?
[Sighs]

22:43.056 --> 22:46.424
A bit calmer now.

22:46.426 --> 22:48.026
How about you?

22:48.028 --> 22:50.762
[Sighs]

22:59.655 --> 23:01.156
It seems we have a lot to discuss

23:01.158 --> 23:03.542
after you're discharged.

23:03.544 --> 23:05.660
We can discuss it now,

23:05.662 --> 23:08.213
or we can just talk
about something else.

23:08.215 --> 23:10.382
It's entirely up to you.

23:13.118 --> 23:14.636
[Sighs]

23:26.298 --> 23:29.801
Joining Hankmed was a very
difficult adjustment for me.

23:34.574 --> 23:36.992
But you made it so much easier

23:36.994 --> 23:39.411
with your kindness

23:39.413 --> 23:41.913
and your compassion.

23:44.116 --> 23:46.167
In retrospect,

23:46.169 --> 23:49.921
I believe that's when my feelings began.

23:49.923 --> 23:52.924
I just never found the strength
to tell you.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.829
Yeah, you did.

23:57.831 --> 23:59.831
You found it today.

24:12.895 --> 24:13.895
How's she doing?

24:13.897 --> 24:15.780
She's resting.

24:17.817 --> 24:21.236
So I thought about what you said.

24:22.521 --> 24:23.788
It was manipulative

24:23.790 --> 24:25.040
to ask you to prescribe those meds

24:25.042 --> 24:28.460
and then disregard your advice.

24:28.462 --> 24:30.578
I needed to prove
that I could shoulder the burden

24:30.580 --> 24:32.797
all on my own.

24:32.799 --> 24:34.132
I needed to prove it to Hankmed,

24:34.134 --> 24:38.036
to our patients, to myself.

24:38.038 --> 24:40.371
But that was my problem,

24:40.373 --> 24:42.307
and I made it yours.

24:42.309 --> 24:44.893
I just... I didn't treat you

24:44.895 --> 24:47.979
with the respect you deserve.

24:47.981 --> 24:51.816
But I do respect you, Jeremiah.

24:51.818 --> 24:53.068
I mean, since you came here,

24:53.070 --> 24:56.438
you've met every challenge you've faced.

24:58.908 --> 25:03.161
And I'm very sorry
that I was one of them.

25:05.164 --> 25:08.750
I hope you'll come back

25:08.752 --> 25:11.736
because we need you.

25:14.623 --> 25:16.791
I need you.

25:18.911 --> 25:20.745
I accept your apology.

25:20.747 --> 25:24.182
And thank you for the explanation.

25:24.184 --> 25:26.968
I wanted to please you,

25:26.970 --> 25:29.420
and I compromised my medical
judgment because of that

25:29.422 --> 25:32.607
and because of insecurities

25:32.609 --> 25:37.445
about other issues in my life.

25:37.447 --> 25:41.866
So I... I'm partly responsible.

25:41.868 --> 25:46.287
But I mustn't risk
repeating those errors.

25:46.289 --> 25:48.289
So...

25:50.960 --> 25:54.612
I can't work with you ever again.

26:09.895 --> 26:11.462
She's hanging us out to dry.

26:11.464 --> 26:15.066
Typical corporate suit.
Saving her own ass.

26:15.068 --> 26:17.519
Mm. All right.

26:17.521 --> 26:19.404
[Snaps fingers]
So what's our move?

26:19.406 --> 26:21.272
Well, we need her back in our corner.

26:21.274 --> 26:23.324
I don't want her near our corner.

26:23.326 --> 26:24.642
No, Hank, we have to fight
the non-compete.

26:24.644 --> 26:26.144
This is our livelihood.

26:26.146 --> 26:27.862
This is more than that.
This is personal.

26:27.864 --> 26:29.864
This is about defending yourself, Hank.

26:29.866 --> 26:30.915
You are Hankmed.

26:30.917 --> 26:32.367
Hankmed is a team effort.

26:32.369 --> 26:33.785
Yeah, you can spare us the modesty, doc.

26:33.787 --> 26:35.086
It's not strategically
productive right now.

26:35.088 --> 26:36.621
Okay.

26:36.623 --> 26:38.206
Trusted by patients

26:38.208 --> 26:39.340
battling severe pain...

26:39.342 --> 26:41.159
pain that symphony's own doctors

26:41.161 --> 26:43.428
couldn't even diagnose.

26:43.430 --> 26:46.014
That's it. Evan, you're a genius.

26:46.016 --> 26:47.465
I'm with you so far.

26:47.467 --> 26:49.768
We threaten to countersue.

26:49.770 --> 26:51.803
Hamptons Heritage failed
to properly investigate

26:51.805 --> 26:53.388
Dr. Lawson's post-operative pain.

26:53.390 --> 26:55.690
No, no, it's not quite
that simple, Keller.

26:55.692 --> 26:57.175
We'll show them impro-fricking-priety.

26:57.177 --> 26:59.177
First, their own incompetence
causes my client

26:59.179 --> 27:00.562
prolonged pain and suffering.

27:00.564 --> 27:01.980
Then they discriminate against him

27:01.982 --> 27:03.398
for treating the very pain they caused.

27:03.400 --> 27:04.566
Ken, that's just not...

27:04.568 --> 27:05.900
We'll bring Shelby to her knees.

27:05.902 --> 27:07.068
Huh.

27:07.070 --> 27:08.236
I walked right into that one.

27:08.238 --> 27:10.238
So I love a good counterattack,

27:10.240 --> 27:11.689
but I'm a newly elected councilman.

27:11.691 --> 27:12.957
I can't be seen targeting

27:12.959 --> 27:14.459
the community hospital for annihilation.

27:14.461 --> 27:16.494
Yeah, nor can I as, you know, a doctor.

27:16.496 --> 27:18.413
I may not have caused
your problem, Hank,

27:18.415 --> 27:19.747
but I certainly made it worse.

27:19.749 --> 27:21.216
And that's not what you hired me to do.

27:21.218 --> 27:22.801
It's time for me to make this right.

27:22.803 --> 27:27.005
No, Ken, please,
just don't make anything right.

27:27.007 --> 27:28.423
[Sighs]

27:28.425 --> 27:29.891
[Knocking at door]

27:29.893 --> 27:32.393

27:32.395 --> 27:35.230

27:35.232 --> 27:38.733
Uh, I'm in for Paris.

27:38.735 --> 27:40.268
And I hope you know how much

27:40.270 --> 27:41.719
your confidence means to me.

27:41.721 --> 27:43.571
I... as you can tell, I'm brushing up on

27:43.573 --> 27:45.240
<i>mon francaise en ce moment.</i>

27:45.242 --> 27:46.891
[Footsteps approach]

27:46.893 --> 27:48.693
Russel, are you in there?

27:48.695 --> 27:51.913
[Groans]

27:51.915 --> 27:54.115
Russel?

27:59.475 --> 28:00.909
[Groaning]

28:00.911 --> 28:02.360
I also called 911.

28:02.362 --> 28:04.529
I know you're not supposed
to do anything for a seizure,

28:04.531 --> 28:05.664
but why won't it stop?

28:05.666 --> 28:07.115
[Panting]

28:07.117 --> 28:08.366
Because this isn't a seizure.

28:08.368 --> 28:10.285
He's making eye contact.
[Groans]

28:10.287 --> 28:12.037
- Russel, can you hear me?
- Help me.

28:12.039 --> 28:13.421
[Pants]

28:13.423 --> 28:15.006
I think he's experiencing

28:15.008 --> 28:17.208
somatic skeletal
neuromuscular dysfunction.

28:17.210 --> 28:19.761
[Groans]
Something poisoned him.

28:19.763 --> 28:21.129
[Sirens wail]
Wha...

28:21.131 --> 28:22.931
you think this is related to his cut?

28:22.933 --> 28:25.133
It's not a cut.

28:25.135 --> 28:27.502
I think this is a bite,
just not from a dinosaur,

28:27.504 --> 28:29.105
and he's having a reaction to the venom.

28:29.106 --> 28:30.855
[Groaning]

28:30.857 --> 28:32.607
In here.

28:32.609 --> 28:34.609
- Is there an antivenom?
- I'm gonna find out.

28:34.611 --> 28:36.478
- What can I do?
- Call poison control.

28:36.480 --> 28:37.779
They need to inspect Emma.

28:37.781 --> 28:39.531
We have to find and identify
the source of the bite

28:39.533 --> 28:40.899
to know what to administer.

28:40.901 --> 28:42.016
I'll go in the ambulance with him.

28:42.018 --> 28:43.818
- I'll meet them on site.
- Okay.

28:43.820 --> 28:45.904
And warn Monique to stay away.

28:45.906 --> 28:48.856
If something poisonous is hiding
inside her dinosaur,

28:48.858 --> 28:49.874
she could be next.

28:49.876 --> 28:51.209
- Right here, guys.
- Okay.

28:51.211 --> 28:52.794
- Let's lay it down right here.

29:09.646 --> 29:12.347
What are you doing here?

29:12.349 --> 29:13.848
Hank called me. I'm here to help.

29:13.850 --> 29:15.216
Help how?

29:15.218 --> 29:16.568
I'm not gonna let you
inside that thing's mouth.

29:16.570 --> 29:17.569
What if it's deadly or something?

29:17.571 --> 29:19.688
Well, then, Russel's dying.

29:19.690 --> 29:21.156
Look, one of us has to do this.

29:21.158 --> 29:24.693
Are you volunteering?

29:24.695 --> 29:25.744
I... I... wait, wait, wait, wait.
Just come down.

29:25.746 --> 29:29.664
Come down, come down.

29:29.666 --> 29:32.734

tells my story, okay?

- I love you.
- Love you.

Okay.

- Wait.
- Oh, thank God.

29:50.187 --> 29:53.188
Take these.

29:53.190 --> 29:54.522
What am I supposed to do with these?

29:54.524 --> 29:57.359
You want me to moonwalk?

29:57.361 --> 30:00.228
It's better than nothing.

30:00.230 --> 30:02.480
Yeah, you're right.

30:03.866 --> 30:05.617
Very small.

30:05.619 --> 30:08.319
Grown men wear these?

30:08.321 --> 30:11.706
- Got that one on.
- Yeah.

30:11.708 --> 30:14.108
Eh.

30:14.110 --> 30:17.829
Do you need some help? Just... let's go.

30:19.215 --> 30:21.115
All right.

- So can you just...
- I got it, I got it.

30:23.420 --> 30:24.803
Just don't look down.

30:24.805 --> 30:26.554

than looking up right now,

but, uh...
