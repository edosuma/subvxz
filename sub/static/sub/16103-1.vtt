01:07.694 --> 01:08.987
Margaret.

01:11.447 --> 01:12.740
Margaret.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.245
Margaret.

01:17.328 --> 01:19.122
Yes?

01:19.205 --> 01:21.165
You should get
some sleep.

01:42.395 --> 01:43.479
Dr. Matheson!

01:43.563 --> 01:46.190
Thanks for coming.

01:46.274 --> 01:49.152
You can't imagine how
pleased I am to see you.

01:49.235 --> 01:51.279
This is Dr. Matheson,
actually.

01:51.362 --> 01:52.864
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.699
Please, forgive me.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.826
These last few days have
been a bit difficult.

01:56.909 --> 01:59.120
Don't worry, I should have worn a lab coat.
That's Dr. Buckley.

01:59.203 --> 02:00.079
Nice to meet you.

02:05.168 --> 02:07.920
The pleasure's
all mine, really.

02:08.003 --> 02:12.050
You can't begin to imagine what's
been going on here, really.

02:12.133 --> 02:15.011
We haven't slept
a wink in weeks--

02:15.094 --> 02:17.138
isn't that right, Sarah?

02:17.221 --> 02:18.973
<i>She hasn’t' been coping</i>
<i>very well None of us have</i>

02:19.057 --> 02:21.142
Did I mention we haven't
slept a wink in days?

02:25.271 --> 02:27.523
That's it.

02:27.607 --> 02:30.068
Did you hear?

02:30.151 --> 02:31.194
It's starting.

02:34.238 --> 02:37.075
Did you hear him?

02:37.158 --> 02:40.203
He is a bit angry today.

02:41.621 --> 02:43.956
Who's angry?

02:44.040 --> 02:46.876
Traci's been
a real help, you know?

02:46.959 --> 02:48.419
She's, uh-- she's
been such a help.

02:48.503 --> 02:49.879
I bet.

02:49.962 --> 02:51.673
Can we see the rest
of the house?

02:51.756 --> 02:53.549
Sure. This
way, please.

02:53.633 --> 02:56.219
It's an old house,
but the price was great.

02:56.302 --> 02:59.972
We only moved in a while ago.
We're still settling in.

03:00.056 --> 03:02.767
Hi, I'm Tom.
Uh, I'm a physicist.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.603
- If you want to keep doing--
- I'm a physicist, too.

03:05.687 --> 03:08.439
What did you think I was?
A housewife?

03:08.523 --> 03:10.775
- A hairdresser?
- No, I--

03:10.858 --> 03:13.194
- Oh, I--I didn't mean--
- Forget it.

03:13.277 --> 03:14.195
Actually, I am
a hairdresser.

03:14.278 --> 03:15.446
Oh.

03:15.530 --> 03:17.657
Traci.
Traci Northrop.

03:17.740 --> 03:21.119
Tom, enough mingling.
We're going upstairs.

03:28.251 --> 03:30.920
I know, she's
been a real help.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.296
Since when?

03:32.380 --> 03:33.923
I don't know,
a few days.

03:34.006 --> 03:35.800
Three or four, isn't
that right, Sarah?

03:35.883 --> 03:38.302
You took so long. We
didn't know where to turn.

03:38.386 --> 03:40.138
We're not a public
service, Mr. Sidgwick.

03:40.221 --> 03:41.931
We do what we can.

03:42.014 --> 03:44.308
Sure. Uh, excuse
me a moment.

03:44.392 --> 03:45.601
The girls' room.

03:49.981 --> 03:51.566
Susan.

03:51.649 --> 03:53.484
How many times have
I told you not to play

03:53.568 --> 03:55.653
on the floor till
the heating gets fixed.

03:55.737 --> 03:57.822
We're still settling
in, you know?

03:57.905 --> 04:01.325
We, uh--still have some
stuff to sort out.

04:01.409 --> 04:02.994
But the price
was great.

04:03.077 --> 04:05.580
Stand up, sweetheart,
and say hello.

04:05.663 --> 04:06.998
Say hi.

04:07.081 --> 04:08.082
Hi.

04:08.166 --> 04:09.250
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:09.333 --> 04:10.668
You said "the girls."

04:10.752 --> 04:12.044
Julia is
at her grandparents'.

04:12.128 --> 04:13.421
She wasn't
feeling so great,

04:13.504 --> 04:15.089
so we thought
we just as soon

04:15.173 --> 04:17.007
send her back to Vermont
for a few days.

04:17.091 --> 04:17.966
A few days.

04:19.469 --> 04:21.262
She's much better now.

04:21.345 --> 04:23.556
Everything's ready.

04:23.639 --> 04:25.975
Sorry. I didn't
mean to butt in.

04:27.310 --> 04:28.978
Whenever you want.

04:32.356 --> 04:33.733
Too much light.

05:06.265 --> 05:08.976
When I begin the session,
no matter what happens,

05:09.060 --> 05:13.231
please don't break
the circle.

05:13.314 --> 05:16.943
It can be dangerous.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.363
January twenty-second.

05:20.446 --> 05:22.448
Eleven fifteen.

05:22.532 --> 05:25.535
Session participants are, from
the north side: Mr. Sidgwick

05:25.618 --> 05:27.203
and his wife,

05:27.286 --> 05:32.083
Dr. Margaret Matheson
and Traci Northrop.

05:32.166 --> 05:35.002
The session is recorded
by Dr. Thomas Buckley.

05:46.764 --> 05:49.433
Temperature is dropping
slowly, one degree--

05:49.517 --> 05:52.562
Correction, two degrees.

05:52.645 --> 05:57.441
Spring scale pressure
remains constant.

05:57.525 --> 06:00.403
I--I can hardly hear you.

06:00.486 --> 06:02.280
Speak up, please.

06:09.829 --> 06:12.832
I can hardly hear you.

06:23.009 --> 06:25.428
I know.

06:25.511 --> 06:26.596
I know, but you
have to speak louder.

06:35.897 --> 06:37.231
Gently.

06:37.315 --> 06:38.649
Please, we've
come to help you.

07:04.634 --> 07:06.177
It really hurts!

07:06.260 --> 07:07.678
Stop it.
Tell it to stop!

07:07.762 --> 07:08.888
Michael, don't break it.

07:08.971 --> 07:10.181
It hurts.
I can't--

07:10.264 --> 07:11.849
I demand
that you stop!

07:11.933 --> 07:13.559
I'm telling you, I
demand that you stop!

07:13.643 --> 07:14.727
Michael, don't
break the circle.

07:14.810 --> 07:16.562
It hurts!
I can't!

07:16.646 --> 07:18.689
- Don't break the circle!
- I demand that you stop!

07:28.616 --> 07:29.659
<i>Mommy! Mommy!</i>

07:29.742 --> 07:31.452
I'm scared, Mommy!

07:31.535 --> 07:33.454
Let's get out of here.
Let's go away from here.

07:33.537 --> 07:35.289
Okay, darling.

07:35.373 --> 07:36.916
Okay.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.587
So do you
miss Vermont?

07:43.881 --> 07:46.717
- Where do you live?
- In Bakersfield.

07:46.801 --> 07:47.885
Nice?

07:48.761 --> 07:49.971
Uh-huh.

07:50.054 --> 07:51.639
Your sister
like it too?

07:54.016 --> 07:55.643
Who had the idea
about the closet?

07:55.726 --> 07:58.354
Was that you,
or your sister?

07:58.437 --> 08:00.272
Julia.

08:00.356 --> 08:03.526
She show you how to bang it
against the wall like that?

08:03.609 --> 08:05.569
It really
scares my dad.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.446
What about your mom?

08:07.530 --> 08:09.365
Mom wants to leave, too.

08:11.659 --> 08:15.079
Let's make a deal,
just between you and me.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.707
Do we have
to shake hands?

08:17.790 --> 08:23.170
No, we don't have
to shake hands.

08:23.254 --> 08:24.672
Here's the deal.

08:24.755 --> 08:26.424
If you promise not
to do it again

08:26.507 --> 08:30.386
I won't say
anything to your dad.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.179
That's it.

08:32.263 --> 08:35.349
I--I didn't do that
thing with the table.

08:35.433 --> 08:39.895
No, I know that, Susan. I
didn't ask you about a table.

08:39.979 --> 08:42.273
My sister's gonna
be real sad.

08:42.356 --> 08:43.566
Yeah.

08:43.649 --> 08:45.693
She's gonna
be real sad.

08:49.155 --> 08:52.366
My car, you drive.
That's fair.

08:52.450 --> 08:54.118
- Why is that fair?
- It is.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.620
Where are you going?

08:56.704 --> 08:58.539
You still didn't get
to the bottom of this!

08:58.622 --> 09:00.583
Don't worry about it,
Mr. Sidgwick.

09:00.666 --> 09:03.753
If the banging starts
again, just call us.

09:03.836 --> 09:05.588
And get rid
of the hairdresser!

11:17.720 --> 11:20.598
It's been an honor to fly
you here, Mr. Silver.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.308
I hope you had
a pleasant flight.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.018
Please, allow me
to help you--

11:24.101 --> 11:27.563
Would you
mind letting go of me?

11:27.646 --> 11:28.731
Thank you.

11:53.339 --> 11:56.342
If you press down
hard on the top of the table

11:56.425 --> 11:59.136
and draw your hands
toward your body,

11:59.220 --> 12:00.846
the outer
two table lengths

12:00.930 --> 12:04.475
are going to go up like
a schoolgirl's dress.

12:04.558 --> 12:07.186
You can even stick
the edge of your shoe

12:07.269 --> 12:08.896
under one
of the table legs

12:08.979 --> 12:11.315
and, by pressing down
firmly with your hands

12:11.398 --> 12:13.234
and lifting your foot
at the same time,

12:13.317 --> 12:15.986
you can make the whole
table come off the ground.

12:16.070 --> 12:18.239
It just takes
a little bit of muscle

12:18.322 --> 12:20.032
and a whole
lot of practice.

12:20.115 --> 12:22.117
So, with the right
partner in crime,

12:22.201 --> 12:24.662
you can put on quite a show.

12:24.745 --> 12:27.373
The setting is important.
Keep it dark,

12:27.456 --> 12:29.875
always, under
any pretext whatsoever.

12:29.959 --> 12:33.671
The spirits demand it,
you need to concentrate--

12:33.754 --> 12:37.216
I know what you are thinking.
It's not scientific.

12:37.299 --> 12:42.221
But you need darkness to develop
a photograph, don't you?

12:42.304 --> 12:44.056
Miss Owen?

12:44.139 --> 12:45.933
So are you saying that
all paranormal phenomena

12:46.016 --> 12:48.102
are frauds
without any exception?

12:48.185 --> 12:49.853
Actually, no, I'm not.

12:49.937 --> 12:52.648
The majority simply have
a natural explanation

12:52.731 --> 12:55.776
or are the result
of subjective interpretation.

12:55.859 --> 12:58.737
But how do you
establish proper controls?

12:58.821 --> 13:00.781
It's not difficult.

13:00.864 --> 13:03.492
In a case like this one, without
any special preparation,

13:03.575 --> 13:05.661
we would sit the medium
against the wall

13:05.744 --> 13:07.997
and place two cards
behind his elbows.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.499
Then if he moves his
arms to shift the table,

13:10.582 --> 13:12.418
the cards will fall.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.169
If the cards
remain in place,

13:14.253 --> 13:16.714
only the spirit
of a very friendly stagehand

13:16.797 --> 13:18.549
is going to be
moving that table.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.050
That's the principle.

13:20.134 --> 13:21.552
Or if you prefer,
you can mark out

13:21.635 --> 13:24.096
a security perimeter
for the hands

13:24.179 --> 13:26.056
to ensure that
no pressure is applied

13:26.140 --> 13:28.225
outside the center of gravity.

13:28.309 --> 13:30.728
For instance,
for the round table,

13:30.811 --> 13:35.524
it will only move if pressure
is exerted here--or here.

13:35.607 --> 13:38.193
Have you ever
come across a single case

13:38.277 --> 13:39.945
that couldn't
be explained?

13:40.029 --> 13:42.197
Like the existence of
an anomalous ability?

13:42.281 --> 13:44.199
An anomalous ability?

13:44.283 --> 13:46.118
Like what?

13:46.201 --> 13:49.538
Like running a hundred
meters in under ten seconds?

13:49.621 --> 13:53.834
Like composing a masterpiece
when you're stone deaf?

13:53.917 --> 13:57.046
Your brain may be
the exception, Ben,

13:57.129 --> 13:59.048
but most brains carry out

13:59.131 --> 14:02.343
a dazzling array of complex
mental processes every second.

14:02.426 --> 14:06.889
100,000 million neurons in
constant synaptic communication

14:06.972 --> 14:10.934
geared to generating and regulating
our sensations and perceptions.

14:11.018 --> 14:12.936
How we reason, how we think,

14:13.020 --> 14:14.938
our emotions,
our mental images,

14:15.022 --> 14:17.691
our attention span,
learning, memory.

14:17.775 --> 14:21.236
Are these not merits enough
for the brain

14:21.320 --> 14:23.781
without it having
"special powers" as well?

14:23.864 --> 14:26.617
So you're
saying the existence of any kind

14:26.700 --> 14:29.620
of paranormal power
is impossible?

14:29.703 --> 14:31.747
What I'm saying,
Miss Owen,

14:31.830 --> 14:35.584
is that after 30 years of
investigating all kinds of phenomena

14:35.667 --> 14:38.295
with the right
controls in place,

14:38.379 --> 14:41.632
I have yet to witness
a single miracle.

14:41.715 --> 14:44.426
- Excellent table lifting.
- Thank you.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.887
I--I just
sat in on your class.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.347
Dr. Shackleton.

14:48.430 --> 14:50.432
Inspirational.
Congratulations.

14:50.516 --> 14:53.477
You know, I admire
your skepticism, Margaret,

14:53.560 --> 14:56.814
but you can't deny reality just
because you can't explain it.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.941
That's not
exactly true.

14:59.024 --> 15:01.151
I can't explain why your
department gets double our budget,

15:01.235 --> 15:03.070
but I don't deny
it's the case.

15:03.153 --> 15:05.614
So let's talk,
join forces.

15:05.697 --> 15:08.826
We're making huge strides
forward in the SPRC.

15:08.909 --> 15:11.829
A discerning vision like
yours could really help.

15:11.912 --> 15:14.123
I don't do hocus
pocus, Shackleton.

15:14.206 --> 15:15.666
I suggest you
don't either.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.594
You didn't
even touch that.

15:27.678 --> 15:29.680
How do you do that?

15:29.763 --> 15:31.348
Isn't that incredible?

15:31.432 --> 15:33.058
Well, it doesn't
always work, Mike.

15:33.142 --> 15:34.435
I got lucky today,

15:34.518 --> 15:35.853
that's all.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.063
The fact is,
we can all do it.

15:38.147 --> 15:40.357
Well, frankly, I knew
that, uh, blind people

15:40.441 --> 15:42.359
had a more developed
sense of smell,

15:42.443 --> 15:44.361
but after what we've
seen here tonight--

15:48.449 --> 15:50.909
You're right.
You're right.

15:50.993 --> 15:54.288
<i>Simon Silver became</i>
<i>popular at the end of the Sixties</i>

15:54.371 --> 15:58.041
<i>and his fame continued</i>
<i>to grow over the next decade.</i>

15:58.125 --> 16:01.003
<i>In 1.975, he suddenly</i>
<i>announced his retirement,</i>

16:01.086 --> 16:02.838
<i>stunning his legion of fans.</i>

16:02.921 --> 16:04.923
<i>Many linked his exit</i>
<i>from the limelight</i>

16:05.007 --> 16:07.676
<i>with the death of a veteran</i>
<i>journalist, Martin Weiner,</i>

16:07.759 --> 16:09.595
<i>a skeptical reporter</i>

16:09.678 --> 16:11.346
<i>who suffered</i>
<i>a heart attack</i>

16:11.430 --> 16:13.265
<i>while attending</i>
<i>one of Silver's shows.</i>

16:13.348 --> 16:15.350
<i>The post-mortem concluded</i>
<i>the heart attack was</i>

16:15.434 --> 16:17.519
<i>the result' of</i>
<i>natural causes</i>

16:17.603 --> 16:19.897
<i>but Silver was never able</i>
<i>to shake off the suspicion</i>

16:19.980 --> 16:22.191
<i>surrounding Weiner's death.</i>

16:22.274 --> 16:25.569
<i>He disappeared just' as suddenly</i>
<i>as he had become a star,</i>

16:25.652 --> 16:27.654
<i>which is why his</i>
<i>come-back announcement</i>

16:27.738 --> 16:30.741
<i>more than 30 years after</i>
<i>his last public appearance...</i>

16:30.824 --> 16:32.910
Margaret, I
was watching that.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.995
Sorry, I, uh--

16:35.078 --> 16:38.874
I thought maybe you wouldn't
hear me, 'cause you--didn't.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.129
Is Dr. Matheson around?

16:44.213 --> 16:45.464
Uh--

16:46.757 --> 16:47.508
No, she's not.

16:47.591 --> 16:49.051
Mm.

16:49.134 --> 16:50.969
Can I leave the
assignment with you?

16:55.015 --> 16:56.099
Yeah.

16:59.394 --> 17:01.563
Just watch
the coin, okay?

17:15.452 --> 17:18.454
- Where'd it go?
- Lift your glass, please.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.627
Where did you
learn to do that?

17:23.710 --> 17:25.671
You can't always
trust your eyes.

17:25.753 --> 17:29.091
You did most of the magic
by looking in the wrong place.

17:29.174 --> 17:30.842
Oh, now you're really
taking the fun out of it.

17:30.926 --> 17:33.554
The simpler, the better.
That's the principle.

17:33.637 --> 17:35.931
The only way to pull a
rabbit out of a hat

17:36.014 --> 17:38.976
is by putting it there
in the first place.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.435
Open it.

17:40.519 --> 17:43.981
It's in your left hand.

17:44.064 --> 17:45.816
Did you--
Did you see that?

17:45.899 --> 17:47.985
No, I got lucky.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.861
The class is really
great, you know?

17:49.945 --> 17:51.947
It makes you think.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.490
So, right, um--

17:53.574 --> 17:55.158
you been working
for Matheson long?

17:55.242 --> 17:56.785
Or are you
a psychologist too?

17:56.868 --> 17:57.953
Or a magician?

17:58.036 --> 17:59.288
Wha--?

17:59.371 --> 18:00.914
Uh, no,
I'm not a magician.

18:00.998 --> 18:02.499
Um, actually,
I'm a physicist.

18:02.583 --> 18:04.960
- So why do you do this?
- Do what?

18:05.043 --> 18:07.254
Investigate fake
paranormal stuff.

18:07.337 --> 18:09.631
Don't you think
it's a bit weird?

18:09.715 --> 18:12.301
- I just try to help Margaret--
- I mean, what for?

18:12.384 --> 18:15.178
If someone claims to have
powers and actually don't,

18:15.262 --> 18:16.972
who cares?
Why bother?

18:17.055 --> 18:18.348
Why bother?

18:22.185 --> 18:24.021
If your mom was one
of those people

18:24.104 --> 18:25.856
who went to see
a psychic

18:25.939 --> 18:29.359
because, um-- her stomach
was bothering her

18:29.443 --> 18:32.779
and the psychic

18:32.863 --> 18:35.866
told her that it was nothing,
that it was just a--

18:35.949 --> 18:39.953
a touch of gastritis.

18:40.037 --> 18:41.705
But then
later on--

18:41.788 --> 18:45.167
you find out
it was stomach cancer

18:45.250 --> 18:46.585
and it's too late to treat.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.007
Do you think then you'd
say "Why bother?"

18:54.134 --> 18:56.219
Did--did that
happen to you?

18:59.348 --> 19:00.349
Okay, watch this.

19:06.063 --> 19:08.523
Ready? Here we go.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.202
Oh, God!
Jesus Christ!

19:21.578 --> 19:23.121
Oh my God,

19:23.205 --> 19:24.539
how did you do that?
Doesn't that hurt?

19:24.623 --> 19:26.458
No.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.335
Well, a litt--
a little.

19:28.418 --> 19:30.295
Simon Silver,

19:30.379 --> 19:32.255
<i>perhaps the most celebrated</i>
<i>psychic of all time,</i>

19:32.339 --> 19:35.050
<i>will visit us here</i>
<i>in just under three weeks.</i>

19:35.133 --> 19:38.720
<i>On/ine bookings have</i>
<i>sky-rocketed in just six hours.</i>

19:38.804 --> 19:41.473
<i>And as soon as the Columbus</i>
<i>Theatre box office opens,</i>

19:41.556 --> 19:43.392
<i>there will be a mad</i>
<i>rush for tickets.</i>

20:51.668 --> 20:54.129
Margaret Matheson.

20:54.212 --> 20:56.047
Hello?

20:56.131 --> 20:59.050
Hello?

21:44.554 --> 21:47.766
Are you okay, Stevie?

21:47.849 --> 21:50.185
You want your music, Stevie?

21:50.268 --> 21:53.647
You want us
to put on your music?

21:53.730 --> 21:58.652
Sometimes it helps him
to listen to music.

21:58.735 --> 22:00.278
Okay.

22:08.286 --> 22:11.331
He thinks
this is really cool!

22:11.414 --> 22:14.292
We do too, but
we don't paint!

22:14.376 --> 22:16.920
Only Stevie paints!

22:17.003 --> 22:19.422
Isn't that right, Stevie?

22:19.506 --> 22:21.591
You paint, don't you?

22:23.802 --> 22:26.012
Kids, huh?

22:26.096 --> 22:28.765
Automatic painting,
my ass!

22:28.849 --> 22:30.642
I was about to make him
eat those crayons.

22:30.725 --> 22:33.603
You heard it, it was, it
was the interference.

22:33.687 --> 22:37.065
It was because Stevie and Van Gogh,
they just-- they don't talk.

22:37.148 --> 22:39.025
If it would
help him channel,

22:39.109 --> 22:40.610
I'm sure the mother would be
happy to cut off his ear.

22:42.070 --> 22:43.405
- Well, a 90 mile drive
- Hm.

22:43.488 --> 22:44.906
And not one
lousy doodle.

22:48.326 --> 22:50.245
Are you okay?

22:50.328 --> 22:53.123
If it were just
me on my own, I--

22:53.206 --> 22:55.458
I don't think
I could continue.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.377
I'm getting too old
for this shit.

22:57.460 --> 22:59.629
Oh, come on.

22:59.713 --> 23:02.299
Where did
you spring from?

23:02.382 --> 23:03.967
You know you could
have a brilliant career

23:04.050 --> 23:06.303
at any university
in the world, right?

23:06.386 --> 23:08.388
You know that.

23:08.471 --> 23:11.933
- Mm. I like this.
- But why are you with me?

23:17.397 --> 23:20.275
Hey, so, um--

23:20.358 --> 23:22.444
Yeah, I was, uh--

23:22.527 --> 23:24.571
You know, maybe
it would be good if

23:24.654 --> 23:27.616
someone else joined the team.
Do you ever think about that?

23:27.699 --> 23:29.284
She's a little young,
don't you think?

23:29.367 --> 23:30.368
Who?

23:33.371 --> 23:34.331
For what?

23:34.414 --> 23:35.832
Right.

23:41.129 --> 23:42.839
I think I'll
look in on David.

23:42.923 --> 23:44.424
If you could drop
me there, please.

23:44.507 --> 23:45.508
Okay.

23:52.515 --> 23:56.019
The reason people
believe in ghosts is

23:56.102 --> 23:58.438
the same as the
reason they believe

23:58.521 --> 24:01.441
in haunted houses
or tunnels of light.

24:01.524 --> 24:05.695
Because it would mean that there
was something-- after death.

24:08.490 --> 24:11.910
I only wish there were.

24:11.993 --> 24:15.497
But I'm not prepared
to let my--beliefs

24:15.580 --> 24:19.501
be determined by my
desires or my--needs.

24:19.584 --> 24:22.003
If David woke up now
and looked in the mirror,

24:22.087 --> 24:24.339
he wouldn't even
know who the man was

24:24.422 --> 24:26.591
staring back at him.

24:26.675 --> 24:29.260
He wouldn't know who I was.

24:29.344 --> 24:32.597
If I thought for one second

24:32.681 --> 24:34.766
that there was something else,

24:34.849 --> 24:37.727
I would shut off all this crap

24:37.811 --> 24:40.355
and let my son go.

24:40.438 --> 24:41.523
Margaret.

24:45.860 --> 24:49.864
A contactee was visited
and raped on a daily basis

24:49.948 --> 24:51.616
by an extraterrestrial.

24:51.700 --> 24:55.161
Savagely possessed.
Every night.

24:55.245 --> 24:59.541
So she goes to a hypnologist
and the visits stop.

24:59.624 --> 25:02.669
So she goes back to the
hypnologist and says:

25:02.752 --> 25:06.006
"Can't you just make him
come back once a week?"

25:11.177 --> 25:13.638
You know, there are two
kinds of people out there

25:13.722 --> 25:15.557
with a special gift:

25:15.640 --> 25:19.519
the ones who really think
they have some kind of power

25:19.602 --> 25:21.021
and the other guys--

25:21.104 --> 25:24.065
who think
we can't figure them out.

25:24.149 --> 25:25.525
They're both wrong.

26:01.311 --> 26:03.563
Aren't
you a little young?

26:04.773 --> 26:06.107
For what?

26:09.110 --> 26:10.570
Right.

26:10.653 --> 26:12.447
So what are
we looking for?

26:12.530 --> 26:13.698
Red lights.

26:13.782 --> 26:15.158
Red lights?

26:15.241 --> 26:16.576
Discordant notes,

26:16.659 --> 26:18.995
things that
shouldn't be there.

26:19.079 --> 26:20.455
Like that
guy over there.

26:21.998 --> 26:23.374
Hot dogs, hamburgers!

26:25.877 --> 26:30.090
Hey, what about
over there?

26:30.173 --> 26:31.549
Well spotted.

26:44.604 --> 26:46.356
- I'm so so sorry.
- What, are you blind?

26:46.439 --> 26:48.233
- It's totally my fault.
- Watch where you're going.

26:48.316 --> 26:50.235
- No, I wasn't watching. I'm sorry.
- Give me that.

26:50.318 --> 26:51.694
- I'm sorry.
- Go on, just get lost now, will you, buddy?

26:51.778 --> 26:52.904
Apologies.

27:01.621 --> 27:02.580
Hoo.

27:02.664 --> 27:04.624
Ha.

27:04.707 --> 27:07.168
Like candy from a baby.

27:07.252 --> 27:08.378
Good.
In we go.

27:08.461 --> 27:09.629
Okay.

27:21.808 --> 27:24.394
Ah. Dr. Matheson.

27:24.477 --> 27:28.523
I take it you've been
told I like the box all to myself.

27:28.606 --> 27:30.233
Yes, of course, doctor,
we know that,

27:30.316 --> 27:32.110
but I was just thinking
we'd have a safe--

27:32.193 --> 27:34.070
And I'm sure you understand
that this deployment

27:34.154 --> 27:39.200
is not what I meant
when I said discreet.

27:39.284 --> 27:41.077
I'm sorry,
Dr. Matheson.

27:41.161 --> 27:44.581
I'll give the orders
to pull back.

27:56.342 --> 27:59.596
Doctor, how come we're
so sure this guy's a fraud?

27:59.679 --> 28:01.848
Ever heard
of Occam's razor?

28:01.931 --> 28:03.349
Occam's razor?

28:03.433 --> 28:04.934
When I hear the
drumming of hooves,

28:05.018 --> 28:06.394
I don't
think unicorns,

28:06.477 --> 28:08.938
I think horses.

28:13.318 --> 28:14.277
Hm.

28:17.113 --> 28:20.325
My name
is Leonardo Palladino.

28:20.408 --> 28:22.410
I can see things.

28:22.493 --> 28:24.537
Just like you.

28:24.621 --> 28:28.791
If not, I would be blind.

28:28.875 --> 28:30.793
I am a mentalist.

28:30.877 --> 28:34.631
I've got a mind, like you.

28:34.714 --> 28:36.257
I'm a clairvoyant.

28:36.341 --> 28:38.635
Because
I can see clearly.

28:40.178 --> 28:41.262
He hasn't changed
a single word.

28:41.346 --> 28:42.889
The only difference--

28:42.972 --> 28:44.182
- You know Palladino from before?
- Hm.

28:44.265 --> 28:45.600
Well, not exactly.

28:45.683 --> 28:46.976
We've had,
Leonardo Borga,

28:47.060 --> 28:49.729
Giordano and--
What was it?

28:49.812 --> 28:51.648
Zarica.

28:51.731 --> 28:54.234
Zarica. But Leonardo Palladino,
it's our first time.

28:54.317 --> 28:55.693
And we're
just thrilled.

28:55.777 --> 28:57.403
And he can't see us?

28:57.487 --> 28:58.696
Not with this light.
The glass is polarized.

28:58.780 --> 29:00.365
No one can see anything.

29:00.448 --> 29:02.242
Unless of course they
have special powers.

29:02.325 --> 29:03.201
I'll tell you
what I don't believe in.

29:03.284 --> 29:05.119
Watch this.

29:05.203 --> 29:08.623
I don't believe in angels
of light curing the good.

29:08.706 --> 29:11.793
I don't believe in
extraterrestrial beings

29:11.876 --> 29:13.711
coming down from the sky

29:13.795 --> 29:17.257
to guide the human race
to an age of re-awakening.

29:17.340 --> 29:18.424
That's new.

29:19.884 --> 29:21.344
Is that the Zimmer?

29:21.427 --> 29:23.096
Yeah, I fixed it
It's all good.

29:23.179 --> 29:25.223
You fixed it? You should
have sent it out.

29:25.306 --> 29:26.766
We don't have any
money. It's fine.

29:26.849 --> 29:28.476
Tom, we should
ask for the money.

29:28.559 --> 29:29.894
I said I fixed it.
It'll work.

29:29.978 --> 29:31.562
- with the Cosmos.

29:31.646 --> 29:33.856
I don't
believe in the Devil.

29:33.940 --> 29:35.358
I don't believe in gods.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.694
I don't believe
in God himself!

29:41.072 --> 29:43.199
I only believe

29:43.283 --> 29:46.035
in a primal, single...

29:46.119 --> 29:47.662
Come on, Tom,
let's go.

29:47.745 --> 29:50.456
Yeah, just a sec.
I'm on it.

29:50.540 --> 29:52.875
...an explosion
of lucidity,

29:52.959 --> 29:56.796
old like the world, which
burns deep within me

29:56.879 --> 30:00.008
and explodes with savage
brutality...

30:00.091 --> 30:02.719
- Tom.
- Yeah, just give me a sec.

30:02.802 --> 30:04.804
- Tom.
- One second. I'm on it.

30:06.306 --> 30:08.808
I only believe in me!

30:08.891 --> 30:10.018
Tom!

30:10.101 --> 30:13.021
I only believe in me!

30:14.397 --> 30:15.189
Come on, Tom.

30:16.399 --> 30:17.984
That's it. Got it.

30:18.067 --> 30:20.028
<i>Leo, can you hear me?</i>

30:20.111 --> 30:22.739
<i>Leo, if you can '2' hear</i>
<i>me, you're in trouble.</i>

30:22.822 --> 30:24.490
My head--

30:24.574 --> 30:25.950
My head.

30:26.034 --> 30:27.618
<i>Judi Cale.</i>

30:27.702 --> 30:29.203
I can feel it.

30:29.287 --> 30:31.039
<i>I repeat': Judi Cale</i>

30:31.122 --> 30:32.540
<i>- Judi Cale.</i>
<i>- To your right'</i>

30:32.623 --> 30:34.459
Judi Cale.

30:34.542 --> 30:36.336
<i>She should be in the</i>
<i>8th row, next to...</i>

30:41.341 --> 30:43.343
They're using inhibitors.
They know what they're doing.

30:43.426 --> 30:46.346
- Can't you do something?
- Yeah, I think so. Just a minute.

30:46.429 --> 30:48.765
Judi Cale, stand up right
now, in the name of God!

30:48.848 --> 30:51.476
Hallelujah! Leonardo
believes again.

30:51.559 --> 30:54.103
Stand up right now.

30:54.187 --> 30:56.856
Stand up right now,
in the name of God!

30:56.939 --> 31:01.361
<i>Lives with her</i>
<i>parents at 3154 Greenwich.</i>

31:01.444 --> 31:04.822
3154 Greenwich.

31:04.906 --> 31:07.617
I can see a ring of white
fire protecting your home.

31:07.700 --> 31:09.827
<i>The girl's</i>
<i>got stomach cancer, Leo.</i>

31:09.911 --> 31:10.953
Don't be scared.

31:11.037 --> 31:12.413
<i>Stomach cancer.</i>

31:12.497 --> 31:14.082
Everything all
right down there?

31:14.165 --> 31:16.042
Everything's wonderful.
Thanks for asking.

31:16.125 --> 31:18.836
- Is it always like this?
- No. We got lucky.

31:18.920 --> 31:21.881
The signal scrambles
every 40 to 50 seconds.

31:23.758 --> 31:25.301
I just gotta isolate
this frequency.

31:25.385 --> 31:26.803
They're not
usually this careful.

31:26.886 --> 31:28.346
I know what's
wrong with you, Judi.

31:28.429 --> 31:31.307
Don't be scared.

31:32.308 --> 31:34.143
Get out!

31:34.227 --> 31:36.729
Leave Judi's stomach! She
doesn't need you anymore!

31:36.813 --> 31:38.314
Get out of there!

31:41.401 --> 31:42.902
Judi.

31:42.985 --> 31:45.363
You're cured.

31:45.446 --> 31:47.532
Shout it out.

31:47.615 --> 31:49.033
I'm cured.

31:49.117 --> 31:50.618
Shout it out, in
the name of God!

31:50.701 --> 31:51.577
I'm cured!

31:51.661 --> 31:53.454
Hallelujah!

31:53.538 --> 31:55.415
'Got it!

31:55.498 --> 31:57.291
<i>Alright',</i>
<i>Leo, Richard Vargas-</i>

31:57.375 --> 31:59.043
<i>I repeat':</i>
<i>Richard Vargas</i>

31:59.127 --> 32:01.170
I'm calling Richard Vargas,
in the name of God!

32:01.254 --> 32:02.964
<i>No, Leo,</i>
<i>correct your position.</i>

32:03.047 --> 32:04.882
I'm calling Richard Vargas,
in the name of God!

32:04.966 --> 32:06.717
<i>He should be</i>
<i>on your right.</i>

32:06.801 --> 32:09.011
Don't be afraid on account
of your sins, Richard.

32:09.095 --> 32:11.848
Stand up and accept
the light of salvation!

32:11.931 --> 32:15.017
He really knows
his moves, doesn't he?

32:15.101 --> 32:16.602
He had a good teacher.

32:16.686 --> 32:17.979
He worked with Silver
for over a year.

32:18.062 --> 32:20.231
Simon Silver,
the blind guy?

32:20.314 --> 32:23.526
<i>Okay, so he's</i>
<i>here with his sister, Maria,</i>

32:23.609 --> 32:26.362
<i>and his mother--</i>
<i>Just hang on--</i>

32:26.446 --> 32:27.697
<i>Dorina.</i>

32:27.780 --> 32:29.824
Richard, don't
be afraid.

32:29.907 --> 32:33.911
Dorina and Maria aren't afraid.
Listen to them.

32:33.995 --> 32:36.372
They want you
to come to the light.

32:36.456 --> 32:38.791
<i>Watch out, Leo! Don't'...</i>
<i>don't get in line with the...</i>

32:40.460 --> 32:42.545
<i>Sorry, my fault-</i>

32:42.628 --> 32:44.589
<i>I think everything's all right.</i>
<i>Everything okay?</i>

32:44.672 --> 32:46.048
You gotta be shitting me.

32:46.132 --> 32:48.342
<i>Do Yo" Copy me, Leo?</i>

32:48.426 --> 32:50.303
I'm with you, Richard!

32:50.386 --> 32:52.054
I'm sorry, my fault'.

32:52.138 --> 32:54.891
Look at me, Richard.
Look at me.

33:00.062 --> 33:02.190
423 Wilbur.

33:02.273 --> 33:06.319
I repeat:
423 Wilbur.

33:06.402 --> 33:09.322
You guys go position yourselves
in the central block now.

33:09.405 --> 33:14.869
We're going with the woman on crutches.
Row--32.

33:14.952 --> 33:17.872
That was close.

33:17.955 --> 33:21.584
Did you check
the auxiliary control?

33:21.667 --> 33:24.921
No. No, Leo. Stop touching
his chest, please.

33:25.004 --> 33:27.006
His arm is the problem.

33:27.089 --> 33:28.716
You know,
one of these days

33:28.799 --> 33:30.218
somebody's gonna
work out he's Argentinean.

33:30.301 --> 33:32.261
Then--then we'll
be in real shit.

33:33.846 --> 33:37.308
Hey. You guys
lose this?

33:37.391 --> 33:41.020
A lot of cancer. Mm.

33:41.103 --> 33:44.023
I'm here, I'm back. There's
no doubt about that.

33:45.691 --> 33:47.818
You know what I'm
talking about, Simon.

33:47.902 --> 33:49.111
Are you going
back on stage?

33:49.195 --> 33:50.655
Well, who
knows, Nina.

33:50.738 --> 33:52.865
I heard it's
a distinct possibility.

33:56.827 --> 34:01.082
I know it's
a delicate subject,

34:01.165 --> 34:03.251
but your last show didn't
turn out so great.

34:03.334 --> 34:04.877
According to some
people, you were--

34:04.961 --> 34:06.712
That was a long time ago

34:06.796 --> 34:08.755
and I said all I had to
say about it back then.

34:08.839 --> 34:10.716
It was a just an unfortunate
thing that happened.

34:10.800 --> 34:12.217
You gotta admit
it was weird.

34:12.301 --> 34:13.469
Your biggest
detractor attacks you

34:13.553 --> 34:15.888
at your own
show, and--

34:15.972 --> 34:17.306
It was unpleasant
for everyone.

34:17.389 --> 34:18.766
The rumor at
the time was that

34:18.849 --> 34:20.518
Martin Weiner
was writing a book

34:20.601 --> 34:22.143
to demonstrate that you
were, uh--well, a fake.

34:22.228 --> 34:23.646
That's, that's
the kind of thing

34:23.728 --> 34:25.481
that I mean
that doesn't stack up.

34:25.565 --> 34:27.650
The same folks out there
who say I have no powers

34:27.733 --> 34:29.860
also say I induced a
heart attack in Martin.

34:29.944 --> 34:31.195
Your number one enemy?

34:31.279 --> 34:32.989
You're safe
with me, Nina.

34:35.032 --> 34:36.826
You know what I think?

34:36.909 --> 34:39.203
I think you're getting
everybody to talk about you

34:39.286 --> 34:40.788
without even going
out there again.

34:40.871 --> 34:42.331
Wouldn't that just
confirm my powers?

34:43.498 --> 34:45.501
You bet it would!

34:45.585 --> 34:48.795
You know, Silver? I've been
wanting to do this for 30 years.

34:48.879 --> 34:49.964
You know what I've
brought with me?

34:50.047 --> 34:51.047
Let me guess.

34:52.757 --> 34:56.846
Is it something
that I can--

34:56.929 --> 34:58.431
bend?

34:58.514 --> 34:59.890
Well, how did
you know that?

34:59.974 --> 35:01.767
Did you just
read my mind?

35:01.851 --> 35:04.103
No. The handle's been
sticking out of your pocket

35:04.186 --> 35:06.105
for the last
few minutes.

35:06.188 --> 35:07.481
So you can--

35:09.817 --> 35:13.029
You are just a big
kid, you know that?

35:13.112 --> 35:15.031
<i>All right, what</i>
<i>do you guys think?</i>

35:15.114 --> 35:17.158
<i>Should we ask him</i>
<i>to bend it'?</i>

35:19.535 --> 35:22.872
Why does no one let
me watch TV in this place?

35:22.955 --> 35:25.041
Because only housewives
watch that show.

35:25.124 --> 35:26.542
Come on!

35:26.626 --> 35:28.711
I have nothing
against housewives.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.296
My mom happens
to be one.

35:30.379 --> 35:32.465
I'm sure your mom

35:32.548 --> 35:35.134
doesn't sit around all day doing
macramé and watching crap TV.

35:35.217 --> 35:36.886
We should take
a shot at Silver.

35:36.969 --> 35:38.554
Oh, come on.
Forget about it.

35:38.638 --> 35:40.056
There's nothing interesting
for us there.

35:40.139 --> 35:42.058
This arrived
this morning.

35:42.141 --> 35:44.810
It hasn't been
digitally retouched.

35:50.274 --> 35:52.068
It's a trampoline.

35:52.151 --> 35:54.820
Are there no real
challenges left out there?

35:54.904 --> 35:56.364
Silver's a
real challenge.

35:56.447 --> 35:58.366
Silver's already
been investigated.

35:58.449 --> 35:59.867
Yeah, like 30 years ago. We
should investigate him now.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.869
He doesn't interest me.
Forget him.

36:01.952 --> 36:03.746
He interests me. Come on! He's
gonna be here in 10 days.

36:03.829 --> 36:06.332
You are like a broken record.
I said no.

36:06.415 --> 36:09.001
What is wrong with you?
Are you afraid of him?

36:13.631 --> 36:17.093
So, if you can get that in--
into a chart for me--Margaret!

36:17.176 --> 36:21.180
Margaret, I heard about Palladino.
Everyone's talking about it.

36:21.263 --> 36:23.933
I wanted to say thank you. People
like them give us a bad name.

36:24.016 --> 36:25.518
I doubt it.

36:25.601 --> 36:27.395
Come on, Margaret,
give us a break.

36:27.478 --> 36:29.146
It's serious work
we're doing up there.

36:29.230 --> 36:30.981
We started
with scores of 2.1.

36:31.065 --> 36:33.025
You know, nothing to write
home about, I know,

36:33.109 --> 36:37.279
but in the last couple of
weeks we scored 3.4, 4, 4.6--

36:37.363 --> 36:40.866
And the chances the difference are down
<i>to coincidence is 2 in 100, Margaret.</i>

36:40.950 --> 36:42.743
- PauL
- Two in a hundred!

36:44.328 --> 36:45.746
All right--

36:45.830 --> 36:47.415
All right.

36:47.498 --> 36:49.458
Tom, go ahead and start
class without me.

36:49.542 --> 36:51.419
Take this,
this and that.

36:51.502 --> 36:54.088
And, um, show them the photograph.
They'll enjoy that.

36:54.171 --> 36:55.881
I won't be long.

36:55.965 --> 36:58.384
So what is it this time?
Psychic photography?

36:58.467 --> 37:00.886
- Retrocognition, remote vision?
- Telepathy.

37:00.970 --> 37:02.847
- Drawings, sealed envelopes, cards?
- Zener cards.

37:02.930 --> 37:04.265
Double blind, triple
blind, simple blind?

37:04.348 --> 37:06.183
Simple blind.
I did it myself.

37:06.267 --> 37:08.227
I take it from your enthusiasm
you just did a test.

37:08.310 --> 37:09.645
That's right.

37:09.729 --> 37:10.688
Were you facing
your subject?

37:10.771 --> 37:12.523
Sure.

37:12.606 --> 37:14.567
What about them?

37:14.650 --> 37:16.277
Uh, they were in the control
booth, monitoring the subject.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.070
Who was monitoring you?

37:18.154 --> 37:20.573
Me? Why would anyone want
to be monitoring me?

37:20.656 --> 37:22.408
It's a joke.

37:22.491 --> 37:24.827
So were you at the same
eye level as the subject?

37:24.910 --> 37:26.245
Approximately, yes

37:26.328 --> 37:27.371
- Under a light, I guess.
- Yes.

37:27.455 --> 37:29.457
The way we are now?

37:29.540 --> 37:31.500
More or less, I guess.

37:31.584 --> 37:33.919
- You have the cards with you?
- No, I-I don't have them here.

37:36.464 --> 37:38.966
- Oh. Yeah, here.
- Okay.

37:43.304 --> 37:45.347
Okay.

37:45.431 --> 37:46.932
Shoot

37:47.016 --> 37:49.185
What do you
mean, "shoot"?

37:49.268 --> 37:51.270
Go ahead. Shoot.

37:51.353 --> 37:53.189
- T-To you?
- Sure.

37:54.398 --> 37:56.484
- Here?
- Why not?

37:56.567 --> 37:58.110
Okay.

38:00.362 --> 38:04.283
Square.

38:04.366 --> 38:06.911
Cross.

38:06.994 --> 38:07.870
Square.

38:09.997 --> 38:12.041
Square.

38:12.124 --> 38:13.501
Star.

38:13.584 --> 38:16.003
- Wave.
- How are you doing that?

38:16.086 --> 38:18.130
- Methodological defects--
- No, w--w--they're not transparent, we make sure--

38:18.214 --> 38:22.009
improper controls, the inadvertent
inclusion of relevant data

38:22.092 --> 38:24.053
or, in this case,

38:24.136 --> 38:25.679
all three at
the same time.

38:25.763 --> 38:27.306
Congratulations.

38:27.389 --> 38:29.725
Next time, try taking
them off first.

38:34.396 --> 38:36.690
So why'd you hold the
card up to the light?

38:36.774 --> 38:39.318
So you wouldn't think
about your glasses.

38:43.322 --> 38:46.992
So, these images were
made during the Cold War--

38:49.537 --> 38:53.207
under conditions controlled
by the Soviet authorities,

38:53.290 --> 38:55.793
so there was no
independent investigations.

39:11.100 --> 39:13.102
Leningrad, 1970.

39:13.185 --> 39:16.605
Here Katia Novikova
carries out

39:16.689 --> 39:19.441
one of her more
controversial experiments.

39:19.525 --> 39:21.318
As you can see,

39:21.402 --> 39:24.363
she concentrates intensely
on the heart of the frog,

39:24.446 --> 39:27.283
at the beginning
making it beat faster,

39:27.366 --> 39:29.410
then slower,

39:29.493 --> 39:34.290
and then, stopping
it beating altogether.

39:34.373 --> 39:38.794
Katia asserted that she had, she had
inherited her powers from her mother--

39:38.878 --> 39:41.714
and that during her childhood,
she would see objects...

39:48.804 --> 39:51.473
Only God is right
all the time, Dr. Matheson.

39:51.557 --> 39:54.435
And yes, there are sensitives
who are impostors,

39:54.518 --> 39:56.353
just like
there are skeptics.

39:56.437 --> 39:58.439
Uh, you know, even scientists
are wrong every day.

39:58.522 --> 40:00.107
But you, the
professional skeptics,

40:00.190 --> 40:01.734
you also seem to be
experts in rhetoric.

40:01.817 --> 40:03.152
Don't--don't bite off
my finger, doctor.

40:03.235 --> 40:05.070
Look where
I'm pointing.

40:05.154 --> 40:07.823
Scientists' mistakes are
usually random, Mr. Cohen.

40:07.907 --> 40:09.825
Pseudo-scientists' mistakes
tend to be directional.

40:09.909 --> 40:11.535
Dr. Matheson seems
to forget that she

40:11.619 --> 40:13.537
set up her stall
on this over 30 years ago.

40:13.621 --> 40:16.332
Most professionals are fully
aware of the dangers of fraud

40:16.415 --> 40:20.002
and design their experiments with
every imaginable precaution.

40:20.085 --> 40:22.171
We're believers, doctor,
not simply credulous.

40:22.254 --> 40:24.173
Very smart people are
often the most credulous

40:24.256 --> 40:26.342
and are taken in by all
kinds of phenomena.

40:26.425 --> 40:29.094
They're easy victims of fraud
because they think logically,

40:29.178 --> 40:31.472
and professional magicians
count on that.

40:31.555 --> 40:34.308
Like your client, for instance.
He's certainly one of them.

40:34.391 --> 40:36.101
You should've told me
she would be here.

40:36.185 --> 40:37.728
Oh, you said you wouldn't
speak to my client.

40:37.811 --> 40:39.939
Are you scared of me too?

40:40.022 --> 40:42.358
The question is why does every
parapsychological phenomenon vanish

40:42.441 --> 40:44.735
when there's a qualified
skeptic in the room?

40:44.818 --> 40:47.404
Three to four Americans say they've had
some kind of metaphysic experience

40:47.488 --> 40:49.281
and an even
higher percentage say--

40:49.365 --> 40:51.241
He's gotta be in on it.
He's in on it.

40:51.325 --> 40:53.285
Doctor, this is a question for you.
Don't you think--?

40:53.369 --> 40:56.372
Margaret, just
get out of there.

40:56.455 --> 40:57.831
- and even my colleagues,

40:57.915 --> 40:59.833
the experimental
psychologists--

40:59.917 --> 41:01.627
They're just gonna box her in.
They're just boxing her in.

41:01.710 --> 41:03.504
...about their approach
to strange occurrences.

41:03.587 --> 41:04.797
This is just what I'm
saying, it's just rhetoric.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.674
It's just
pure rhetoric,

41:06.757 --> 41:09.009
it's just talking the talk,
but to refute the role

41:09.093 --> 41:10.636
that all crows are black you need
just one single white one. Actually--

41:10.719 --> 41:11.804
I've never seen a
white crow, have you?

41:11.887 --> 41:13.806
Look a bit harder.

41:13.889 --> 41:15.015
Miss Hansen, I believe that
you're Simon Silver's agent,

41:15.099 --> 41:17.059
are you not?

41:17.142 --> 41:18.435
I guess that means you've
gotten to know him pretty well

41:18.519 --> 41:20.562
over the years,
is that true?

41:20.646 --> 41:22.523
I'm privileged.
He's a constant inspiration.

41:22.606 --> 41:24.692
Silver's comeback has turned
into an event.

41:24.775 --> 41:27.903
His recent sell-out performances
in both Atlanta and Dallas

41:27.987 --> 41:30.906
can only be described
as an unbelievable success.

41:30.990 --> 41:33.617
Today he will be
performing in our city,

41:33.701 --> 41:37.079
at the Columbus Theater, less than
500 yards away from this studio.

41:37.162 --> 41:40.416
Now, Miss Hansen, is "perform"...?
That's a funny word.

41:40.499 --> 41:42.710
Do you think that's the right word
to describe what's going on here?

41:42.793 --> 41:45.004
I would say "share."

41:45.087 --> 41:46.839
Simon has never been ashamed of
sharing his extraordinary abilities.

41:46.922 --> 41:48.924
I think that "perform"
is exactly the right word.

41:49.008 --> 41:50.342
I beg to disagree.

41:50.426 --> 41:52.094
Why allow for
a rigorous study

41:52.177 --> 41:54.096
when the mass spectacle
is there to be embraced

41:54.179 --> 41:55.556
and there's money
to be made?

41:55.639 --> 41:57.099
A lot of money,
I would imagine.

41:57.182 --> 41:59.018
The word "choice."

41:59.101 --> 42:01.145
- Excuse me, Simon Silver
- Taking advantage of people.

42:01.228 --> 42:02.813
Was subjected to rigorous studies
by at least two different--

42:02.896 --> 42:04.398
Oh, come on!

42:04.481 --> 42:05.899
Universities of
unquestionable renown.

42:05.983 --> 42:07.609
But I guess
you know this, doctor,

42:07.693 --> 42:09.486
since you were on one
of those committees.

42:09.570 --> 42:10.863
<i>I never signed off</i>
<i>on the findings however.</i>

42:10.946 --> 42:12.865
- Are you okay?
- Sh--sh--sh.

42:12.948 --> 42:14.575
<i>The</i>
<i>experiments weren't done</i>

42:14.658 --> 42:16.160
<i>under proper</i>
<i>controlled conditions.</i>

42:16.243 --> 42:18.120
Yeah,
controlled conditions.

42:18.203 --> 42:19.747
Those of us born different
feel real safe.

42:19.830 --> 42:21.665
Complete inspection
of all body orifices,

42:21.749 --> 42:23.709
Faraday cages where we are
locked away like animals,

42:23.792 --> 42:25.627
And--and you're
surprised that Silver

42:25.711 --> 42:27.004
refused to subject
himself to that.

42:27.087 --> 42:28.714
No, I'm not
at all surprised

42:28.797 --> 42:30.758
that he refused to
follow the one protocol

42:30.841 --> 42:33.469
that would effectively eliminate
any possibility of fraud.

42:33.552 --> 42:36.597
All this sounds very convincing,
doctor, but in actual fact,

42:36.680 --> 42:38.390
telepathic experiments...

42:38.474 --> 42:40.601
No, no, no, no, do not
go on the defensive.

42:40.684 --> 42:42.561
Margaret, do not go
on the defensive!

42:42.644 --> 42:44.188
She's going
on the defensive.

42:44.271 --> 42:46.231
Can you see this?
This is what she does.

42:46.315 --> 42:47.524
She goes on the defensive and
then the whole thing just--

42:47.608 --> 42:49.526
- in light of

42:49.610 --> 42:50.903
my considerable experience
investigating these phenomena,

42:50.986 --> 42:53.363
Aw, don't give
'em an edge.

42:53.447 --> 42:55.199
<i>...Of the existence</i>
<i>of paranormal powers...</i>

42:55.282 --> 42:57.910
She's gonna
mention the bone.

42:57.993 --> 42:59.661
Just wait, she's gonna
mention the bone.

42:59.745 --> 43:01.914
Do not
mention the bone.

43:01.997 --> 43:04.374
I've spoken to some
of those supposed victims

43:04.458 --> 43:06.251
whose eyes you
claim to have opened,

43:06.335 --> 43:07.836
and, believe me, they don't
have very nice things

43:07.920 --> 43:09.922
to say about you.

43:10.005 --> 43:11.715
Telling people they've been
victimized by these crazy ideas

43:11.799 --> 43:13.509
and then trying to get
the ideas away from them

43:13.592 --> 43:15.219
it's like trying to take
a bone away from a dog.

43:16.637 --> 43:18.347
They don't
want to let go.

43:18.430 --> 43:19.932
<i>Maybe / don'!</i>
<i>know my place but'-</i>

43:20.015 --> 43:21.391
How did
you know that?

43:21.475 --> 43:22.684
Because I'm psychic.

43:22.768 --> 43:24.561
Yes, she did,

43:24.645 --> 43:26.563
that's exactly what we are to you.
We were animals.

43:26.647 --> 43:27.981
What I'm saying is give me
proof that a photon of light

43:28.065 --> 43:29.775
can pass through
a human body

43:29.858 --> 43:31.360
and I will start to
believe in invisibility.

43:31.443 --> 43:33.362
Until that happens,

43:33.445 --> 43:35.614
all we're talking about here
is simple subjective beliefs.

43:35.697 --> 43:38.117
What do you
believe in, Dr. Matheson?

43:38.200 --> 43:41.120
Do you have a transcendent
view of life?

43:41.203 --> 43:42.496
A what?

43:42.579 --> 43:44.957
Well, you
talk about beliefs.

43:45.040 --> 43:47.042
What do you
believe in?

43:47.126 --> 43:48.919
Well, I don't really see what
that has to do with anything.

43:49.002 --> 43:50.712
Well, it's a very
simple question

43:50.796 --> 43:52.548
that maybe
you can answer.

43:52.631 --> 43:54.591
I'm just asking you,
do you believe or don't you?

43:54.675 --> 43:57.845
Well, I try to
understand, not believe.

43:57.928 --> 44:00.722
So you accept that it's possible
there's something out there?

44:00.806 --> 44:03.100
No, I didn't say that.

44:03.183 --> 44:05.978
You're a
religious person?

44:06.061 --> 44:10.566
No. You know, once, long
ago, I suppose I was.

44:10.649 --> 44:12.442
Long ago?

44:12.526 --> 44:16.864
And you lost your faith.
What--what happened, what--

44:16.947 --> 44:20.659
What happened to
turn you into this--

44:20.742 --> 44:24.496
lost, lonely woman?

44:24.580 --> 44:26.582
- It's just a simple question.
- We're done.

44:26.665 --> 44:28.125
<i>Oh, so just</i>
<i>get up and walk away?</i>

44:28.208 --> 44:31.128
<i>I didn't mean</i>
<i>anything by it.</i>

44:31.211 --> 44:32.963
<i>Sometimes things get'</i>
<i>said, Dr. Maths-son,</i>

44:33.046 --> 44:34.882
<i>and it's not always</i>
<i>pure hyperbole-</i>

44:34.965 --> 44:36.717
<i>It's always</i>
<i>the same with girls</i>

44:36.800 --> 44:39.011
<i>I'm terribly</i>
<i>sorry about this.</i>

44:39.094 --> 44:41.013
<i>We expected her to</i>
<i>follow through--</i>

44:41.096 --> 44:43.182
<i>Animals!</i>

44:43.265 --> 44:45.017
<i>--and I hope</i>
<i>she'll come back</i>

44:45.100 --> 44:46.768
<i>Meantime, thank</i>
<i>you to the panelists.</i>

44:55.777 --> 44:57.529
This is one
of the kinder ones.

44:57.613 --> 44:59.531
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Tom.

44:59.615 --> 45:01.700
Do you have any idea the
advantage he has over us now?

45:01.783 --> 45:03.785
In one minute we've
gone back decades!

45:03.869 --> 45:05.954
We gotta investigate Silver!
We gotta do it now!

45:06.038 --> 45:07.789
Tom, I can see
you're angry--

45:07.873 --> 45:09.625
You've been keeping me
away from him for weeks.

45:09.708 --> 45:11.293
I'm not stupid, Margaret,
so stop pretending I am.

45:11.376 --> 45:13.295
I know you're not.
He is not worth your--

45:13.378 --> 45:14.630
Enough!

45:14.713 --> 45:16.256
We gotta
investigate him,

45:16.340 --> 45:17.966
and if you won't,
I'll do it on my own.

45:18.050 --> 45:19.801
Look, I know they did
a job on you, okay?

45:19.885 --> 45:21.678
I know it wasn't fair and
that stooge of Silver's

45:21.762 --> 45:23.347
played dirty.
But she did it.

45:23.430 --> 45:25.182
They took you by
surprise, I understand.

45:25.265 --> 45:26.934
I don't know what I would
have done in your place

45:27.017 --> 45:29.228
but here's where we are:
We look like idiots.

45:29.311 --> 45:30.854
It's been over two years

45:30.938 --> 45:32.731
since we received
a lousy private dollar

45:32.814 --> 45:34.775
and the department funding
is so ridiculously low,

45:34.858 --> 45:37.069
the only way they can make it
clearer they want rid of us

45:37.152 --> 45:38.737
is with a marching band.

45:38.820 --> 45:39.738
It has nothing to do
with the university,

45:39.821 --> 45:41.156
it's Silver.

45:41.240 --> 45:42.491
But Silver
wasn't even there!

45:42.574 --> 45:44.451
Silver is
always there.

45:44.534 --> 45:45.911
Don't you get it?

45:45.994 --> 45:47.204
No, we gotta
investigate Silver!

45:47.287 --> 45:48.330
And we
gotta do it now!

45:48.413 --> 45:51.208
Tom, sit down.

45:51.291 --> 45:52.834
Just sit down.

45:53.961 --> 45:55.212
Please?

46:01.593 --> 46:03.345
This is how
he does it.

46:03.428 --> 46:05.222
He did it to me, and now
he's doing it to you.

46:05.305 --> 46:07.474
- What does that even mean?
- It's not the first time.

46:07.557 --> 46:09.434
He knows
what he's doing.

46:09.518 --> 46:13.188
We're weak, Tom. We want to
be strong but we're not.

46:13.272 --> 46:14.773
You're not
angry with me.

46:17.651 --> 46:22.197
Every time I close my eyes,
I see my son that day.

46:22.281 --> 46:25.200
I see David playing
over there on the floor.

46:25.284 --> 46:30.122
He was so small.
He was sturdy.

46:30.205 --> 46:32.124
And then he fell.

46:32.207 --> 46:34.418
He just fell over.

46:34.501 --> 46:36.378
I thought he was
playing, but he wasn't.

46:36.461 --> 46:38.005
He was four
years old.

46:38.088 --> 46:40.340
- Margaret, I'm really--
- Shh.

46:40.424 --> 46:42.050
Everything's all right.

46:42.134 --> 46:43.510
I write to him,
you know?

46:43.593 --> 46:45.804
Because I know
he can't hear me.

46:45.887 --> 46:47.431
"Dear David..."

46:52.144 --> 46:54.104
Silver and I

46:54.187 --> 46:57.566
were on a television show just
like the one yesterday...

46:57.649 --> 46:59.234
and he was shouting.

46:59.318 --> 47:00.986
I was shouting.

47:01.069 --> 47:03.864
We were young.

47:03.947 --> 47:06.325
And then he
started staring.

47:06.408 --> 47:07.993
Not at me.

47:08.076 --> 47:10.871
He was staring at
something beside me,

47:10.954 --> 47:12.998
as if he could see
someone beside me,

47:13.081 --> 47:14.624
you know, the
way the mediums do

47:14.708 --> 47:17.419
when they say they
can see an angel or--

47:17.502 --> 47:20.255
or a dead relative
next to you.

47:20.339 --> 47:23.300
No. I wasn't surprised.

47:23.383 --> 47:25.427
I was expecting theatrics,

47:25.510 --> 47:27.929
so I was prepared.

47:28.013 --> 47:31.266
"I see a boy
by your side.

47:31.350 --> 47:33.101
"I see a blond boy.

47:33.185 --> 47:35.520
"Do you know who that
might be, Margaret?

47:35.604 --> 47:37.522
"Has a boy close
to you died?"

47:41.068 --> 47:43.487
I didn't answer.

47:43.570 --> 47:45.530
I couldn't speak.

47:45.614 --> 47:48.075
I was so frightened.

47:48.158 --> 47:50.285
And he kept going.

47:50.369 --> 47:55.832
"This boy is asking
you to let him go.

47:55.916 --> 47:59.920
"He says you
have to let him go.

48:00.003 --> 48:04.549
"It's his time and you
won't let him go."

48:04.633 --> 48:07.469
Now, did I
denounce him

48:07.552 --> 48:09.805
as an unscrupulous fraud?

48:09.888 --> 48:13.809
Did I tell him that my
son was still alive?

48:13.892 --> 48:17.979
Did I say anything in front
of those millions of people

48:18.063 --> 48:20.732
who were waiting
for my answer?

48:20.816 --> 48:24.027
No. I didn't say a thing.

48:24.111 --> 48:27.864
And you know the one
thing I can't forgive?

48:27.948 --> 48:30.283
And I hate myself
for feeling this.

48:30.367 --> 48:32.911
I hate myself from the moment
I wake up in the morning

48:32.994 --> 48:35.163
to when I close
my eyes at night.

48:35.247 --> 48:39.501
What I can't forgive is not
that he dared to use my son,

48:39.584 --> 48:41.920
my sleeping, sick son.

48:42.003 --> 48:45.298
What I can't forgive
is that for one second,

48:45.382 --> 48:48.677
and it only
lasted a second,

48:48.760 --> 48:51.763
I thought
it might be true.

48:51.847 --> 48:56.601
He made me doubt!

48:56.685 --> 48:58.103
And everyone
could see it.

49:02.691 --> 49:05.485
He's dangerous, Tom.

49:05.569 --> 49:08.029
Stay away from him.

49:11.992 --> 49:14.411
What can
you really know?

49:14.494 --> 49:17.372
What can you really trust?

49:17.456 --> 49:21.877
What are your doubts?
What are your certainties?

49:21.960 --> 49:24.921
What do you call truth?

49:25.005 --> 49:28.049
When you look at the sky,
what do you see?

49:28.133 --> 49:31.845
Shadows? Reflections?

49:31.928 --> 49:35.098
Distant echoes?

49:35.182 --> 49:38.393
You see the moon as it was
more than a second ago.

49:38.477 --> 49:41.396
You see the sun as it was
shining eight minutes ago.

49:41.480 --> 49:43.982
But what
do you really see?

49:44.065 --> 49:46.276
Can you trust your eyes?

49:46.359 --> 49:49.446
Can you trust--me?

50:12.844 --> 50:15.096
We can go forward
with lies but--

50:15.180 --> 50:17.182
we can never go back.

50:57.347 --> 50:59.057
You are cured.

51:03.144 --> 51:06.356
Go in peace.

51:06.439 --> 51:10.318
I never felt proud
of being what I am.

51:10.402 --> 51:12.904
I didn't choose it.
I didn't ask for anything.

51:12.988 --> 51:15.365
Why was I chosen?
Who singled me out?

51:15.448 --> 51:18.326
You're asking
yourselves the same questions.

51:18.410 --> 51:20.954
Right now.
At this very instant.

51:21.037 --> 51:22.664
I can hear you.

51:22.747 --> 51:24.958
James Liddenbrock.

51:26.376 --> 51:29.838
James Herbert Liddenbrock.

51:29.921 --> 51:31.756
Stand up!

53:32.669 --> 53:33.670
Margaret?

54:02.532 --> 54:03.658
Margaret!

54:03.742 --> 54:04.743
Margaret.

54:04.826 --> 54:05.702
It's okay.

54:07.120 --> 54:08.455
It's okay.
Come on.

54:08.538 --> 54:09.914
Help!

54:09.998 --> 54:10.832
Please!

54:10.915 --> 54:12.250
Help!

54:12.333 --> 54:14.169
What are you
doing, Margaret?

54:16.254 --> 54:18.214
Fuck!

54:18.298 --> 54:20.008
It's okay.

54:22.677 --> 54:25.221
All right.

54:28.850 --> 54:30.602
You gotta wait here.

54:30.685 --> 54:32.479
As soon as we know anything,
I'll come find you.

54:32.562 --> 54:33.855
- Does she have any relatives?
- Uh, well, a son, but--

54:33.938 --> 54:35.648
- Can you let him know?
- Uh...

54:35.732 --> 54:37.776
As soon as we know anything,
I'll come find you.

54:48.536 --> 54:50.205
Hey.

54:50.288 --> 54:53.625
Uh, they told me
you were here.

54:53.708 --> 54:55.168
How's the doctor?
Is she all right?

54:55.251 --> 54:57.295
I don't--uh,
I don't know.

54:57.378 --> 54:58.963
They haven't
told me anything.

55:01.508 --> 55:04.385
What happened to you?
You're hurt.

55:10.517 --> 55:13.728
I wasn't with her.

55:13.812 --> 55:16.815
I wasn't with her.

55:16.898 --> 55:18.608
I was at the theater
with Silver.

55:18.691 --> 55:21.236
She told me
not to go.

55:21.319 --> 55:23.613
I said horrible things.

55:30.036 --> 55:33.748
What's the point in keeping him
here like that after all this time?

55:54.602 --> 55:58.773
Every science has its
corresponding pseudoscience.

55:58.857 --> 56:03.278
Psychology has its flip
side, parapsychology.

56:03.361 --> 56:08.366
Medicine has acupuncture
and homeopathy.

56:08.449 --> 56:11.953
Astronomy has astrology.

56:12.036 --> 56:15.248
I've had personalized birth
charts made for each of you

56:15.331 --> 56:17.083
based on your
individual dates of birth.

56:17.166 --> 56:19.168
If you could open
the envelope, please,

56:19.252 --> 56:21.546
and study them carefully.

56:41.733 --> 56:43.776
Hello?

56:43.860 --> 56:46.863
Hello? This is
Tom Buckley.

56:46.946 --> 56:48.489
Hello?

56:48.573 --> 56:50.491
This is Tom Buckley.

56:54.495 --> 56:55.705
Silver?

56:59.709 --> 57:01.711
Okay, now you've
all had a chance to

57:01.794 --> 57:03.630
study your charts

57:03.713 --> 57:05.965
so we're going to grade
them from one through five,

57:06.049 --> 57:07.926
one being a low level
of coincidence

57:08.009 --> 57:10.386
five, being a maximum
of correlation.

57:10.470 --> 57:12.931
How many ones?

57:13.014 --> 57:14.307
Good.

57:14.390 --> 57:18.311
Two?

57:18.394 --> 57:21.064
Threes?

57:21.147 --> 57:21.898
Good.

57:21.981 --> 57:24.901
Four?

57:24.984 --> 57:25.818
Good.

57:25.902 --> 57:27.236
And five?

57:27.320 --> 57:28.696
Good.

57:28.780 --> 57:30.031
Okay. If you can
pass your chart

57:30.114 --> 57:31.741
to the person behind you.

57:31.824 --> 57:32.700
And if you guys
in the back--

57:33.618 --> 57:34.285
What?

57:51.594 --> 57:52.845
They're all the same.

57:56.432 --> 57:59.310
Er--

57:59.394 --> 58:01.562
We're just going to leave
it at that for today, so--

58:01.646 --> 58:04.440
We'll pick it up tomorrow.
Thank you for coming.

58:38.474 --> 58:41.269
Fuck!

59:51.756 --> 59:54.717
This isn't my
first time inside, know that?

59:59.472 --> 01:00:00.932
Leonardo.

01:00:01.015 --> 01:00:02.934
Yes, Buckley, Leonardo.
Good memory.

01:00:03.017 --> 01:00:07.814
You're butting
in already!

01:00:07.897 --> 01:00:10.775
At 5:00 a.m. they give you
a little carton of milk.

01:00:10.858 --> 01:00:14.195
I don't eat breakfast.
I wait until lunch at eleven.

01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:17.865
Elbow macaroni with hot
pepper, rice, frijoles...

01:00:17.949 --> 01:00:19.784
Hardly ever meat.

01:00:19.867 --> 01:00:22.161
Sometimes you get
a spicy hamburger.

01:00:22.245 --> 01:00:24.038
They think
we're all Mexicans.

01:00:24.122 --> 01:00:26.707
At five, you get
the same thing again.

01:00:26.791 --> 01:00:28.626
And that's it
until the next day.

01:00:28.709 --> 01:00:31.337
So at night I take out
my carton of milk.

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:32.964
Leonardo...

01:00:33.047 --> 01:00:34.090
I've lost 15 pounds
in less than 4 weeks.

01:00:34.173 --> 01:00:35.883
- Leonardo!
- Yes?

01:00:35.967 --> 01:00:39.554
You told Silver
we'd be there,

01:00:39.637 --> 01:00:41.514
didn't you?

01:00:41.597 --> 01:00:45.601
You told him how
we shut you down.

01:00:45.685 --> 01:00:48.187
Did the blind guy
spook us then, Buckley?

01:00:50.231 --> 01:00:52.275
Did the blind guy see us
when we were up to no good?

01:00:52.358 --> 01:00:53.901
When'd you talk to Silver?

01:00:53.985 --> 01:00:55.486
Buckley, you've come
to the wrong place.

01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:56.988
Silver doesn't
need me to know

01:00:57.071 --> 01:00:58.948
whatever he wants
to know, get it?

01:00:59.031 --> 01:01:00.408
This isn't one
of your shows.

01:01:00.491 --> 01:01:01.993
I'm the guy
who put you in here.

01:01:02.076 --> 01:01:03.911
Now tell me when
you spoke to Silver!

01:01:03.995 --> 01:01:06.706
I hardly know Silver, you
fucking shit for brains!

01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:08.332
You worked with him
for over a year!

01:01:08.416 --> 01:01:10.334
20 years ago! Did
nobody tell you that?

01:01:10.418 --> 01:01:11.878
I'm 37, Buckley.

01:01:11.961 --> 01:01:13.588
I was just a fucking
kid back then.

01:01:13.671 --> 01:01:15.464
He used me!

01:01:15.548 --> 01:01:17.383
I just had to cry and shut
up whenever he told me.

01:01:17.466 --> 01:01:19.552
Do you think he spilled his
fucking heart out to me?

01:01:19.635 --> 01:01:21.512
I'm wasting
my time here.

01:01:21.596 --> 01:01:22.972
You've got no idea what
you're getting yourself into.

01:01:23.055 --> 01:01:24.932
Good seeing you
again, Leonardo.

01:01:25.016 --> 01:01:28.186
You've got no idea what
you're getting yourself into!

01:01:30.688 --> 01:01:32.690
<i>Whoa, did you know...</i>

01:01:32.773 --> 01:01:35.109
<i>Silver canceled his</i>
<i>last' performances in Denver</i>

01:01:35.193 --> 01:01:37.111
<i>to do one more here?</i>

01:01:37.195 --> 01:01:39.530
<i>I guess</i>
<i>he-'s afraid of flying-</i>

01:01:39.614 --> 01:01:41.449
<i>I hope the theater</i>
<i>had insurance-</i>

01:01:41.532 --> 01:01:43.201
<i>I mean, last show in</i>
<i>town almost spelled</i>

01:01:43.284 --> 01:01:45.244
<i>the end of</i>
<i>the Columbus Theater.</i>

01:01:45.328 --> 01:01:47.955
<i>Forget it. My nephew bends</i>
<i>spoons all the time</i>

01:01:48.039 --> 01:01:49.707
<i>and all he's gotten</i>
<i>for his troubles</i>

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:51.959
<i>is to make my sister</i>
<i>hide the spoons.</i>

01:01:52.043 --> 01:01:53.920
<i>If your nephew was blind,</i>

01:01:54.003 --> 01:01:55.463
<i>God forbid</i>
<i>I would say that'-</i>

01:01:55.546 --> 01:01:57.298
<i>If my nephew was blind,</i>

01:01:57.381 --> 01:02:00.051
<i>my sister wouldn’t '2' need</i>
<i>to hide the spoons.</i>

01:02:00.134 --> 01:02:01.594
<i>That sure</i>
<i>would be cruel.</i>

01:02:01.677 --> 01:02:04.013
- You bet.
- Ow.

01:02:04.096 --> 01:02:06.474
<i>What' do you say we open the phone</i>
<i>lines so some people can call?</i>

01:02:06.557 --> 01:02:09.644
<i>Anybody blind out there</i>
<i>who wants to sue us?</i>

01:02:09.727 --> 01:02:11.145
<i>Anybody-- What?</i>
<i>No, no, please.</i>

01:02:11.229 --> 01:02:12.313
<i>No- None of that</i>

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:14.023
<i>I challenge you</i>

01:02:14.106 --> 01:02:15.650
<i>You'll leave us</i>
<i>with no aim in life!</i>

01:02:15.733 --> 01:02:16.734
<i>Bring it on... bring...</i>

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:35.503
Fuck!

01:02:40.174 --> 01:02:41.175
What?

01:02:41.259 --> 01:02:43.094
Okay, okay, Okay-

01:02:43.177 --> 01:02:44.011
Come on!

01:02:45.012 --> 01:02:45.805
Come on!

01:02:51.519 --> 01:02:52.728
Come on.

01:03:19.213 --> 01:03:20.298
Oh, fuck!

01:03:23.175 --> 01:03:24.343
I'm sor--

01:03:24.427 --> 01:03:26.095
I'm sorry.

01:03:39.525 --> 01:03:41.610
<i>J” In the summertime,</i>
<i>When the weather is hot J"</i>

01:03:41.694 --> 01:03:43.779
<i>J' You can touch right up</i>
<i>And touch the--J'./'</i>

01:03:54.790 --> 01:03:55.916
Ah, fuck!

01:05:30.845 --> 01:05:31.971
Fuck.

01:05:53.367 --> 01:05:54.660
Okay.

01:06:20.478 --> 01:06:22.229
Do you have
an appointment, sir?

01:06:22.313 --> 01:06:23.439
Can I help you?

01:06:23.522 --> 01:06:24.982
I was--

01:06:25.065 --> 01:06:28.027
I was just looking
for the way out.

01:06:28.110 --> 01:06:28.903
Excuse me.

01:06:28.986 --> 01:06:30.321
Right.

01:06:36.827 --> 01:06:40.080
Tom.

01:06:40.164 --> 01:06:42.333
Tom.

01:06:42.416 --> 01:06:44.251
Open your eyes.

01:07:33.676 --> 01:07:35.052
- Hey, what's the matter?
- Aw!

01:07:35.135 --> 01:07:36.554
Fuck!

01:07:36.637 --> 01:07:38.514
Wait, are you okay?
What happened?

01:07:38.597 --> 01:07:40.558
Hey, hey.

01:07:40.641 --> 01:07:41.475
Shh!

01:07:43.561 --> 01:07:44.645
Tom... Tom...

01:07:44.728 --> 01:07:45.729
Shh!

01:07:48.357 --> 01:07:49.400
Tom...

01:07:49.483 --> 01:07:50.359
Tom.

01:08:13.924 --> 01:08:15.884
Shh. It's okay.

01:08:15.968 --> 01:08:18.511
- Will you tell me what's going on?
- It's okay. It's okay!

01:08:24.935 --> 01:08:26.520
Silver?

01:08:34.403 --> 01:08:35.487
Silver!

01:09:03.015 --> 01:09:04.558
Silver!

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.604
Tom, what's going on?

01:09:09.688 --> 01:09:11.106
Come on.

01:09:15.277 --> 01:09:17.279
Don't leave me here.

01:09:17.363 --> 01:09:19.156
Don't leave me here!

01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:20.407
Silver!

01:09:26.121 --> 01:09:27.915
Silver!

01:09:53.816 --> 01:09:55.317
You left me on my own.

01:09:55.401 --> 01:09:56.694
I told you not
to leave me on my own.

01:09:56.777 --> 01:09:58.278
You need to leave here.

01:09:58.362 --> 01:09:59.655
What's going on?

01:09:59.738 --> 01:10:01.115
Jesus, Tom,
you're bleeding.

01:10:01.198 --> 01:10:02.700
You need to get
that cleaned up.

01:10:08.497 --> 01:10:10.165
What's going on?

01:10:32.688 --> 01:10:34.648
<i>University sources</i>
<i>confirm that Simon Silver</i>

01:10:34.732 --> 01:10:36.108
<i>has accepted</i>
<i>the invitation</i>

01:10:36.191 --> 01:10:38.110
<i>of Paul Shackleton,</i>

01:10:38.193 --> 01:10:40.112
<i>head of the Scientific</i>
<i>Paranormal Research Center</i>

01:10:40.195 --> 01:10:42.197
<i>to be submitted to</i>
<i>an exhaustive scientific study</i>

01:10:42.281 --> 01:10:44.533
<i>of his extrasensory abilities.</i>
<i>Isn/sn't that right, Dick?</i>

01:10:44.616 --> 01:10:46.076
<i>Yes, that's</i>
<i>the way it is, Dana</i>

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.120
<i>For two weeks,</i>
<i>Simon Silver,</i>

01:10:48.203 --> 01:10:50.330
<i>who had been called into</i>
<i>question in this university</i>

01:10:50.414 --> 01:10:52.332
<i>by the late</i>
<i>Margaret's son</i>

01:10:52.416 --> 01:10:54.293
<i>will put' himself through</i>
<i>all kinds of tests</i>

01:10:54.376 --> 01:10:56.712
<i>designed by a committee</i>
<i>of experts from the SPRC.</i>

01:10:56.795 --> 01:10:59.757
<i>University sources confirm that</i>
<i>Dr. Matheson had been suffering</i>

01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:02.426
<i>from a rare and long-standing</i>
<i>vascular condition</i>

01:11:02.509 --> 01:11:04.428
<i>which could</i>
<i>be the cause</i>

01:11:04.511 --> 01:11:06.305
<i>of her unexpected illness</i>
<i>and sudden death-</i>

01:11:06.388 --> 01:11:07.931
Why didn't you tell me?

01:11:08.015 --> 01:11:10.058
I don't understand
what you're talking--

01:11:10.142 --> 01:11:12.436
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Why don't you step into my office?

01:11:12.519 --> 01:11:14.271
I want to be on that
committee, Shackleton.

01:11:14.354 --> 01:11:15.814
Whatever it takes,

01:11:15.898 --> 01:11:17.691
I don't care what,
I wanna be there.

01:11:17.775 --> 01:11:19.443
It's impossible. The team
has already been presented.

01:11:19.526 --> 01:11:21.403
There's nothing I can do.

01:11:21.487 --> 01:11:24.156
Don't give me your excuses,
Shackleton. Just do it.

01:11:26.658 --> 01:11:28.619
The committee was
approved by Silver!

01:11:28.702 --> 01:11:30.204
You know what that means?

01:11:30.287 --> 01:11:31.997
It's a once
in a lifetime opportunity!

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.707
Whatever it
takes, Shackleton!

01:11:33.791 --> 01:11:36.376
No more whining.
No more moaning.

01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:40.297
Ask for more observers. Make
up whatever story you want.

01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.841
Get that over-subsidized
brain of yours working.

01:11:42.925 --> 01:11:46.887
I wanna be there.

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:49.223
I'll be waiting
for your call.

01:11:54.853 --> 01:11:56.230
Don't leave me here.

01:11:56.313 --> 01:11:57.397
Let me at least
try and help you.

01:11:57.481 --> 01:11:58.899
I'm going to be fine.

01:11:58.982 --> 01:11:59.983
It's just
for a little while, okay?

01:12:00.067 --> 01:12:01.902
Look at you, Tom.

01:12:01.985 --> 01:12:04.321
Margaret was right. Can't you see it?
Just let it go.

01:12:04.404 --> 01:12:05.989
- I need to know how he does it.
- What difference does it make how he does it?

01:12:06.073 --> 01:12:07.825
Forget about Silver, Tom.

01:12:07.908 --> 01:12:09.159
There are certain things
it's better not to know.

01:12:09.243 --> 01:12:10.494
Sally, I just
need to know.

01:12:16.208 --> 01:12:18.001
<i>Meters have been installed</i>

01:12:18.085 --> 01:12:20.212
<i>to defect the exertion</i>
<i>of any physical force</i>

01:12:20.295 --> 01:12:22.130
<i>or the use of irregular</i>
<i>chemical compounds</i>

01:12:22.214 --> 01:12:24.216
<i>such as mercuric chloride,</i>

01:12:24.299 --> 01:12:26.468
<i>known to alter the</i>
<i>resistance level of metals</i>

01:12:26.552 --> 01:12:28.595
<i>Each piece has</i>
<i>been specially marked</i>

01:12:28.679 --> 01:12:31.181
<i>to prevent the possibility</i>
<i>of any swap during the tests.</i>

01:12:31.265 --> 01:12:35.394
<i>Thermoelectric heat meters,</i>
<i>radiation monitors,</i>

01:12:35.477 --> 01:12:38.355
<i>everything in the Scientific</i>
<i>Paranormal Research Center /ab</i>

01:12:38.438 --> 01:12:40.148
<i>is in place</i>
<i>to test Simon Silver,</i>

01:12:40.232 --> 01:12:42.025
<i>who this morning</i>
<i>may have just canceled</i>

01:12:42.109 --> 01:12:44.361
<i>a number of his</i>
<i>public appearances.</i>

01:12:44.444 --> 01:12:45.988
This just isn't fair.

01:12:46.071 --> 01:12:47.239
We've been waiting
in line for two days.

01:12:47.322 --> 01:12:48.699
Eating and sleeping here.

01:12:48.782 --> 01:12:50.325
Who's standing up
for our rights?

01:12:50.409 --> 01:12:52.578
It wasn't
just a show, for me.

01:12:52.661 --> 01:12:56.415
For me it was more
important. And now--

01:12:56.498 --> 01:12:58.083
I don't care.
Hell, I really don't.

01:12:58.166 --> 01:13:00.127
If he thinks it's cool,
I think it's cool.

01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:02.754
I just hope he shows those
smart-ass college know-it-alls.

01:13:02.838 --> 01:13:04.840
Shit, what the hell are all
these people doing here anyway?

01:13:04.923 --> 01:13:07.384
Like, they put on the TV for 15
minutes and obey like sheep.

01:13:07.467 --> 01:13:09.595
What's this guy done
that's so incredible?

01:13:09.678 --> 01:13:11.555
Like, has nobody
heard of Criss Angel?

01:13:11.638 --> 01:13:13.932
It's a matter
of absolute priority

01:13:14.016 --> 01:13:16.268
that science begins to learn
all it can about these forces.

01:13:16.351 --> 01:13:17.728
We can't wait any longer.

01:13:17.811 --> 01:13:19.438
The aim of my public
appearances

01:13:19.521 --> 01:13:20.939
is just to generate
the necessary conditions

01:13:21.023 --> 01:13:22.774
so that our blind
society will open

01:13:22.858 --> 01:13:25.360
its eyes to the existence
of other forms of energy.

01:13:25.444 --> 01:13:27.613
These forces can't
be ignored any longer.

01:13:27.696 --> 01:13:30.490
They have to be verified and accepted
once and for all. Thank you.

01:13:30.574 --> 01:13:32.951
Is it true that you
canceled some of your shows?

01:13:33.035 --> 01:13:35.412
Nothing's been canceled.
We're just re-scheduling.

01:13:35.495 --> 01:13:37.789
Mr. Silver.
One more question.

01:13:37.873 --> 01:13:39.374
<i>More than 100 journalists</i>
<i>have requested accreditation</i>

01:13:39.458 --> 01:13:41.460
<i>to cover the SPRC experiments,</i>

01:13:41.543 --> 01:13:43.670
<i>more like the numbers we</i>
<i>expect at a political summit</i>

01:13:43.754 --> 01:13:45.464
<i>than scientific research.</i>

01:13:45.547 --> 01:13:47.633
<i>However, only a handful</i>
<i>of media outlets</i>

01:13:47.716 --> 01:13:50.177
<i>have been granted passes</i>
<i>to the inside of the building</i>

01:13:50.260 --> 01:13:51.845
<i>and none are allowed</i>
<i>to remain there</i>

01:13:51.929 --> 01:13:53.972
<i>while the tests</i>
<i>are faking place.</i>

01:13:54.056 --> 01:13:57.351
We're trying to guarantee control conditions.
We're scientists,

01:13:57.434 --> 01:14:00.646
and for the first time we could
just obtain conclusive results

01:14:00.729 --> 01:14:03.357
about the reality
of extrasensory perception,

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.859
the power of the
mind over matter.

01:14:05.943 --> 01:14:10.030
Our priority has to be to ensure
the veracity of those results.

01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:12.282
Today's a great day,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:14:12.366 --> 01:14:15.535
We could just be about
to go beyond...

01:14:15.619 --> 01:14:18.163
beyond a point of no return.

01:14:18.246 --> 01:14:20.916
And... cut!

01:14:20.999 --> 01:14:22.376
Great, we got it.

01:14:22.459 --> 01:14:23.919
Thank you.
Thank you, everyone.

01:14:24.002 --> 01:14:26.046
Thank you for coming.

01:14:26.129 --> 01:14:28.882
From now on, no cameras
except the university's

01:14:28.966 --> 01:14:33.553
will be allowed in the lab. Thank
you again for your cooperation.

01:14:40.811 --> 01:14:42.396
Remember, Buckley,

01:14:42.479 --> 01:14:43.855
you don't form
a part of this committee.

01:14:43.939 --> 01:14:45.816
You're just an observer.

01:14:45.899 --> 01:14:48.193
You'll make no contribution
to the design of the tests

01:14:48.276 --> 01:14:50.404
or the control protocols.

01:14:50.487 --> 01:14:53.448
You can look, you can listen and
you can shut your goddamn mouth.

01:14:53.532 --> 01:14:55.701
Don't think
I'm scared of you.

01:14:55.784 --> 01:14:58.745
If I'm putting up with you, it's
out of respect for Margaret.

01:14:58.829 --> 01:15:00.497
You try to honor her
in the same way.

01:15:04.793 --> 01:15:06.753
Mr. Silver!

01:15:06.837 --> 01:15:08.755
Mr. Silver,
allow me to say

01:15:08.839 --> 01:15:10.507
thank you for
agreeing to do this.

01:15:10.590 --> 01:15:12.342
And let me
apologize in advance

01:15:12.426 --> 01:15:15.012
for any inconvenience
we might cause.

01:15:15.095 --> 01:15:17.014
Science will be
very grateful to you.

01:15:17.097 --> 01:15:18.640
Well, that is
my sole objective.

01:15:18.724 --> 01:15:21.059
It's me who should
be grateful to you.

01:15:21.143 --> 01:15:23.812
Oh, you already
know Dr. Haynes.

01:15:23.895 --> 01:15:26.398
Doctor.

01:15:26.481 --> 01:15:27.774
Dr. Campbell.

01:15:27.858 --> 01:15:29.818
- Doctor.
- Hello, sir.

01:15:29.901 --> 01:15:32.279
Dr. Conrad Jennings, professor
of Biomedical Engineering,

01:15:32.362 --> 01:15:34.031
University of Leeds,

01:15:34.114 --> 01:15:36.658
- has been kind enough to join us.
- Doctor.

01:15:36.742 --> 01:15:38.952
And Professor Franklin,
Professor of Physics,

01:15:39.036 --> 01:15:40.370
Case Western University
of Ohio.

01:15:40.454 --> 01:15:41.663
Doctor.

01:15:41.747 --> 01:15:43.415
Now, if you
don't mind--

01:15:43.498 --> 01:15:48.503
There's another guest
here, isn't that right?

01:15:48.587 --> 01:15:50.589
Yes, that--that
is right.

01:15:50.672 --> 01:15:52.299
Excuse me, I--I didn't
introduce you formally.

01:15:52.382 --> 01:15:53.717
Have you met before?

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.719
I don't know. Have we?

01:15:55.802 --> 01:15:57.429
Dr. Buckley, of the University's
Psychology Department.

01:15:57.512 --> 01:15:59.473
He worked very
closely with Doctor--

01:15:59.556 --> 01:16:02.642
I have a great interest in the
figure of Doctor Buckley.

01:16:02.726 --> 01:16:08.023
I follow his
progress very closely.

01:16:08.106 --> 01:16:10.192
It's been a difficult
time for all of us, Tom.

01:16:10.275 --> 01:16:11.902
How are you
getting along?

01:16:11.985 --> 01:16:15.530
I was so sorry to hear
about Dr. Matheson.

01:16:15.614 --> 01:16:17.616
Of course, uh--

01:16:17.699 --> 01:16:22.329
we can begin whenever
you feel ready.

01:16:22.412 --> 01:16:24.039
If you'd like
to come this way.

01:16:26.792 --> 01:16:29.628
We know this isn't
an exact science.

01:16:32.297 --> 01:16:34.800
Take your
time, whatever you need.

01:16:34.883 --> 01:16:36.802
We'll start with something
straightforward,

01:16:36.885 --> 01:16:38.678
you know,
like an icebreaker.

01:16:38.762 --> 01:16:41.515
Oh, oh, sure.
Psy-- Psychic photography?

01:16:41.598 --> 01:16:43.225
Thoughtography.
How--How did you know?

01:16:43.308 --> 01:16:45.143
Oh, it's been a long
time since I did this,

01:16:45.227 --> 01:16:46.812
a very long
time indeed.

01:16:46.895 --> 01:16:48.396
Digital, isn't it?

01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:50.565
Yeah, it is.
Exactly. Do you need...?

01:16:50.649 --> 01:16:52.275
I just need a simple
piece of cardboard.

01:16:52.359 --> 01:16:53.985
I don't want my fingers
smudging the lens.

01:16:54.069 --> 01:16:56.655
We opted to prepare
a plastic cylinder.

01:16:56.738 --> 01:17:01.409
I hope you don't mind. It's
a half inch in diameter.

01:17:01.493 --> 01:17:03.036
Is it okay, will it do?

01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:05.038
One never knows,
Dr. Shackleton.

01:17:05.122 --> 01:17:09.042
As you just said yourself,
this isn't an exact science.

01:17:09.126 --> 01:17:11.628
Do you mind?

01:17:11.711 --> 01:17:13.130
Go ahead.

01:17:29.646 --> 01:17:31.189
Please, be careful
with my watch.

01:17:31.273 --> 01:17:33.316
The glass top flips up.

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.694
I don't want the hands
moved by mistake.

01:17:57.507 --> 01:17:59.134
From now on you'll
not be allowed

01:17:59.217 --> 01:18:01.052
to withdraw your hands
from the table,

01:18:01.136 --> 01:18:03.763
unless it is for the purpose
of another inspection.

01:18:03.847 --> 01:18:04.764
You understand that,
don't you?

01:18:04.848 --> 01:18:05.765
Yes.

01:18:05.849 --> 01:18:07.267
If you do so,

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:09.019
the test will
be declared invalid.

01:18:09.102 --> 01:18:10.812
Okay, thank you.

01:18:32.209 --> 01:18:34.377
Ready when you are.

01:18:42.594 --> 01:18:45.263
<i>This film</i>
<i>shows the first six days</i>

01:18:45.347 --> 01:18:47.140
<i>of investigation carried out</i>

01:18:47.224 --> 01:18:49.309
<i>in the Scientific Paranormal</i>
<i>Research Center</i>

01:18:49.392 --> 01:18:51.686

01:18:56.816 --> 01:18:58.860
<i>This is Simon Silver.</i>

01:19:04.866 --> 01:19:06.993
<i>For the following experiment,</i>

01:19:07.077 --> 01:19:09.412
<i>Silver received three different</i>
<i>models of still camera:</i>

01:19:09.496 --> 01:19:11.164
<i>a middle range</i>
<i>digital camera</i>

01:19:11.248 --> 01:19:12.832
<i>with a fixed /ens</i>
<i>focused on infinity,</i>

01:19:12.916 --> 01:19:15.043
<i>a conventional</i>
<i>analogical camera</i>

01:19:15.126 --> 01:19:17.337
<i>with a 50 mm /ens</i>
<i>focused on infinity</i>

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:21.091
<i>and an instant Polaroid camera,</i>
<i>also focused on infinity.</i>

01:19:21.174 --> 01:19:22.968
<i>Silver's attempts</i>
<i>with the digital camera</i>

01:19:23.051 --> 01:19:25.178
<i>did not produce</i>
<i>any positive result'</i>

01:19:25.262 --> 01:19:27.973
<i>The second camera registered</i>
<i>only partial results,</i>

01:19:28.056 --> 01:19:30.350
<i>insufficient' for</i>
<i>a positive evaluation</i>

01:19:30.433 --> 01:19:33.687
<i>Only the Polaroid camera allowed</i>
<i>the apparent projection</i>

01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:35.897
<i>of Silver's thoughts</i>
<i>onto the photographic plate.</i>

01:19:35.981 --> 01:19:38.984
<i>There is no scientific</i>
<i>explanation for these results.</i>

01:19:39.067 --> 01:19:42.279
<i>The cylinder or gizmo which</i>
<i>Silver was provided with</i>

01:19:42.362 --> 01:19:44.781
<i>in order to concentrate</i>
<i>the flow of his thoughts</i>

01:19:44.864 --> 01:19:48.159
<i>was carefully checked before</i>
<i>and after each experiment</i>

01:19:48.243 --> 01:19:51.413
<i>in order to rule out</i>
<i>any possible manipulation.</i>

01:19:55.125 --> 01:19:58.420
<i>Silver claims to be capable of</i>
<i>bending metal at a distance</i>

01:19:58.503 --> 01:20:00.380
<i>without needing</i>
<i>to touch it'.</i>

01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:02.257
<i>However, during the</i>
<i>course of these tests,</i>

01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:04.801
<i>this could not be</i>
<i>experimental! y confirmed.</i>

01:20:04.884 --> 01:20:07.220
<i>Following a more</i>
<i>relaxed protocol,</i>

01:20:07.304 --> 01:20:09.264
<i>Silver was allowed</i>
<i>to touch the metal</i>

01:20:09.347 --> 01:20:11.516
<i>which, as can be seen</i>
<i>in the film, was indeed bent.</i>

01:20:11.599 --> 01:20:14.728
<i>Visual analysis of the film</i>

01:20:23.111 --> 01:20:25.572
<i>by a paranormal ability,</i>
<i>as he claims.</i>

01:20:25.655 --> 01:20:28.033
<i>Later, Simon Silver</i>
<i>held his hand out</i>

01:20:28.116 --> 01:20:30.493
<i>in the continuous flow</i>
<i>of a running tap.</i>

01:20:30.577 --> 01:20:33.872
<i>As the images show, the flow</i>
<i>of water was notably deviated</i>

01:20:33.955 --> 01:20:37.709
<i>by some kind of external</i>
<i>stimulus around Silver's hand.</i>

01:20:37.792 --> 01:20:39.669
<i>The difficulty in measuring</i>
<i>this distortion</i>

01:20:39.753 --> 01:20:41.004
<i>in a conclusive manner,</i>

01:20:41.087 --> 01:20:43.048
<i>means this demonstration</i>

01:20:43.131 --> 01:20:45.884
<i>has been excluded from</i>
<i>any experimental e valuation.</i>

01:20:55.977 --> 01:20:57.687
I think I've
got it, Doctor.

01:20:57.771 --> 01:20:59.064
I was trying with
the second adapter

01:20:59.147 --> 01:21:00.023
but if I could
just join--

01:21:01.232 --> 01:21:02.901
Concentrate, Ben.

01:21:02.984 --> 01:21:04.736
I appreciate your help.
No more mistakes, okay?

01:21:04.819 --> 01:21:06.529
I'm sorry,
Doctor, I promise--

01:21:06.613 --> 01:21:09.366
Don't promise anything.
Just plug it in. Good.

01:21:09.449 --> 01:21:11.034
What, black and white?

01:21:11.117 --> 01:21:13.119
It's fine. It doesn't matter.
Okay.

01:21:13.203 --> 01:21:14.746
Keep going keep
going keep going...

01:21:14.829 --> 01:21:16.831
Stop! Stop there.

01:21:16.915 --> 01:21:20.293
Okay, this was the last test.
Telepathy booths.

01:21:20.377 --> 01:21:22.087
During the
whole two weeks,

01:21:22.170 --> 01:21:23.922
I wasn't able to get
within six feet of Silver,

01:21:24.005 --> 01:21:26.091
but you and I both know
the whole thing is a farce.

01:21:26.174 --> 01:21:28.885
- Actually, Dr. Buckley, I--
- A total fucking farce. Okay, rewind.

01:21:28.968 --> 01:21:30.678
Keep going,
keep going.

01:21:30.762 --> 01:21:32.430
Okay, go over to the
other side of the gym.

01:21:32.514 --> 01:21:34.391
Stop, Ben!
Stop there! Stop!

01:21:34.474 --> 01:21:36.935
You know, right now, Shackleton
is analyzing the data,

01:21:37.018 --> 01:21:39.479
getting ready to publish
his positive findings tonight.,

01:21:39.562 --> 01:21:42.357
which just happens to coincide
with Silver's last show,

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.067
which by some
strange coincidence,

01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:45.318
just happens to be
taking place

01:21:45.402 --> 01:21:47.028
in this very city.

01:21:47.112 --> 01:21:48.738
It's the finale he's
been after all along.

01:21:48.822 --> 01:21:50.281
Well, why
all this pressure?

01:21:50.365 --> 01:21:51.825
If we find out
something afterwards,

01:21:51.908 --> 01:21:53.618
they'll have to change
the findings.

01:21:53.701 --> 01:21:55.120
Ben, nothing that happens
afterwards will matter.

01:21:55.203 --> 01:21:57.330
Listen to me.
You are the only guy

01:21:57.414 --> 01:22:00.125
separating the world from stupidity
at this point in time. Okay?

01:22:00.208 --> 01:22:03.294
Okay? Now, you
see this button?

01:22:03.378 --> 01:22:07.966
I've spent two days loading all
the images from all the cameras

01:22:08.049 --> 01:22:09.509
then synching them
frame by frame,

01:22:09.592 --> 01:22:11.052
with all the
angles in here, okay?

01:22:14.013 --> 01:22:15.849
Okay? Okay, Ben?

01:22:15.932 --> 01:22:18.518
This is the reception booth.
Silver is the receiver.

01:22:18.601 --> 01:22:21.813
That's the instrument panel.
It's got ten luminous buttons.

01:22:21.896 --> 01:22:23.273
Normally they put
a playing card in each one,

01:22:23.356 --> 01:22:25.024
but given
that Silver is blind

01:22:25.108 --> 01:22:26.484
they've just numbered
them one through ten.

01:22:26.568 --> 01:22:27.819
Okay, and what's
supposed to...?

01:22:27.902 --> 01:22:28.945
Quiet.
Now, second booth.

01:22:30.697 --> 01:22:32.198
It doesn't matter.
It's just a dead bird.

01:22:32.282 --> 01:22:34.033
This is the
transmission booth.

01:22:34.117 --> 01:22:35.702
Now, you see the monitor?
It's a closed circuit.

01:22:35.785 --> 01:22:37.370
Is he seeing
his own panel?

01:22:37.454 --> 01:22:38.955
No. No, no, no.
He's seeing Silver's panel.

01:22:39.038 --> 01:22:40.707
It's supposed
to help him concentrate.

01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:43.001
So the computer randomly
turns on a light.

01:22:43.084 --> 01:22:44.544
Then the guy
concentrates

01:22:44.627 --> 01:22:46.087
on the number he's
been given. Okay?

01:22:46.171 --> 01:22:47.422
When he thinks
he knows the number,

01:22:47.505 --> 01:22:49.090
he presses
the red button,

01:22:49.174 --> 01:22:51.217
which sets off a signal
in Silver's booth.

01:22:51.301 --> 01:22:53.219
When Silver
hears the signal,

01:22:53.303 --> 01:22:55.054
he clears his mind, he
concentrates, whatever the fuck,

01:22:55.138 --> 01:22:56.598
when he thinks
he knows the answer,

01:22:56.681 --> 01:22:57.932
he presses
the corresponding number

01:22:58.016 --> 01:22:59.517
he think the guy
has sent.

01:22:59.601 --> 01:23:01.019
Is that clear?

01:23:01.102 --> 01:23:02.687
Okay.The
experiment lasted

01:23:02.770 --> 01:23:04.814
a total of seven
hours, including breaks.

01:23:04.898 --> 01:23:08.151
It was repeated a total of
nine times, in blocks of ten.

01:23:08.234 --> 01:23:10.987
The results were spectacular,
with a deviation rate

01:23:11.070 --> 01:23:13.865
eight times higher than
can be explained by chance.

01:23:13.948 --> 01:23:15.074
Now, what
does this mean?

01:23:15.158 --> 01:23:16.910
That Silver's powers--?

01:23:16.993 --> 01:23:19.412
No! It means that Silver
is pulling a fast one!

01:23:19.496 --> 01:23:22.499
Do you know how I know this?
Because telepathy does not exist!

01:23:22.582 --> 01:23:24.876
Because nobody
has special powers!

01:23:24.959 --> 01:23:27.253
No. The protocol,
in theory, is sound.

01:23:27.337 --> 01:23:29.923
It's just that Silver has
found a way of breaching it.

01:23:30.006 --> 01:23:32.091
Okay, don't look
for radio transmitters,

01:23:32.175 --> 01:23:33.843
because the booths work as Faraday chambers.
I've checked them.

01:23:33.927 --> 01:23:35.386
They're isolated.

01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:36.971
What if he's not
pulling a fast one?

01:23:37.055 --> 01:23:38.515
Ben, you've got
4 1/2 hours

01:23:38.598 --> 01:23:40.683
of footage there
from seven cameras.

01:23:40.767 --> 01:23:42.393
- That's 30 hours.
- What am I looking for?

01:23:42.477 --> 01:23:43.937
An explanation, Ben,
just an explanation.

01:23:44.020 --> 01:23:45.855
Try to make
it rational.

01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:08.086
Hey.

01:24:08.169 --> 01:24:09.671
Is everything
okay, sweetie?

01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:56.718
It's raining.

01:25:40.219 --> 01:25:41.679
Sit down, please.

01:25:41.763 --> 01:25:43.431
I'll be with you
in just a minute.

01:25:51.522 --> 01:25:54.025
I'm not a very
accessible person.

01:25:54.108 --> 01:25:56.361
I suppose you've
realized that by now.

01:25:56.444 --> 01:26:02.950
Only somebody who really wants
to get to me can do so.

01:26:03.034 --> 01:26:05.912
I won't talk to
anybody else today.

01:26:05.995 --> 01:26:11.334
Maybe I'll do so tomorrow,
in some other city.

01:26:11.417 --> 01:26:12.919
Maybe I won't ever again.

01:26:19.008 --> 01:26:22.095
As for me, I live each day
as if it were my last.

01:26:22.178 --> 01:26:24.597
And I'm starting
to feel tired.

01:26:24.681 --> 01:26:26.432
Very tired indeed.

01:26:36.109 --> 01:26:40.279
I don't always demand payment for
my services, did you know that?

01:26:40.363 --> 01:26:45.284
At least, not in money. There's
other ways of paying for things.

01:26:45.368 --> 01:26:47.495
But you know that already.

01:26:52.667 --> 01:26:54.127
You do know that,
don't you?

01:26:58.131 --> 01:27:01.300
To be
or to appear to be,

01:27:01.384 --> 01:27:05.888
that is the question.
It always is.

01:27:05.972 --> 01:27:08.474
We all try to be
something we're not.

01:27:29.912 --> 01:27:31.914
We dream 27 times a night.

01:27:31.998 --> 01:27:34.625
An intricate neurological
protection mechanism

01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:37.170
which makes us forget.

01:27:37.253 --> 01:27:40.131
What protects you?

01:27:40.214 --> 01:27:45.178
Aline of salt?

01:27:45.261 --> 01:27:48.181
From the time of ancient
Greece to the present day,

01:27:48.264 --> 01:27:50.683
philosophers and scholars
have argued

01:27:50.767 --> 01:27:52.310
man is essentially rational.

01:27:52.393 --> 01:27:54.479
I don't happen to agree.

01:27:54.562 --> 01:27:56.856
If one observes and
studies another person

01:27:56.939 --> 01:27:59.150
without having first
studied oneself,

01:27:59.233 --> 01:28:03.279
how do we know whether our
instruments are appropriately set?

01:28:03.362 --> 01:28:06.115
How do we know we are reliable?
We have no proof.

01:28:06.199 --> 01:28:08.743
There's only one way

01:28:08.826 --> 01:28:11.370
of gaining
access to the truth,

01:28:11.454 --> 01:28:13.039
and that's not
to expect anything.

01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:17.126
If our intentions
aren't pure,

01:28:17.210 --> 01:28:19.462
we might end up
creating monsters.

01:28:30.139 --> 01:28:33.267
Hm. Please excuse me.
It's getting late.

01:28:33.351 --> 01:28:36.187
For you too.

01:28:36.270 --> 01:28:40.608
Don't worry, we'll see
each other again.

01:28:40.691 --> 01:28:44.237
Oh, yes. We'll see
each other again.

01:28:46.572 --> 01:28:49.325
<i>Silver is in the</i>
<i>final stages of his countdown,</i>

01:28:49.408 --> 01:28:52.912
<i>only 12 hours after the announcement</i>
<i>of his most recent retirement.</i>

01:28:52.995 --> 01:28:55.915
This unexpected news
has caused commotion...

01:28:55.998 --> 01:28:58.376
...all kinds of
contradictory reactions.

01:28:58.459 --> 01:29:01.254
Those that predicted that
Silver had come back to stay

01:29:01.337 --> 01:29:03.548
have had no option
but to accept...

01:29:05.383 --> 01:29:07.552
...estimate that Silver
may well have pocketed

01:29:07.635 --> 01:29:09.679
more than four million dollars
in less than a month,

01:29:09.762 --> 01:29:11.556
a figure that
would confirm...

01:29:11.639 --> 01:29:13.432
--most immediate
consequences,

01:29:13.516 --> 01:29:16.102
with prices of up
to 2,000 dollars

01:29:16.185 --> 01:29:18.563
being asked by
scalpers for seats,

01:29:18.646 --> 01:29:20.731
a more than dubious record
being held today...

01:29:20.815 --> 01:29:22.483
...packed out an hour and
a half before the start

01:29:22.567 --> 01:29:24.777
of what will be
his last appearance.

01:29:24.861 --> 01:29:27.363
It is impossible to predict
an outcome for this...

01:29:27.446 --> 01:29:29.448
...and it's with
great expectation

01:29:29.532 --> 01:29:33.327
the verdict from the Scientific
Paranormal Research Center,

01:29:33.411 --> 01:29:35.246
to be announced
officially tonight.

01:29:35.329 --> 01:29:37.248
If the leaks get out...

01:29:37.331 --> 01:29:39.292
...maybe thereby silencing
more than one skeptical voice,

01:29:39.375 --> 01:29:40.668
and transcending
once and for all

01:29:40.751 --> 01:29:42.378
the area of mystification

01:29:42.461 --> 01:29:44.338
and the study
of frontier sciences.

01:29:44.422 --> 01:29:46.799
Science has rarely had the
chance to study at close hand

01:29:46.883 --> 01:29:48.551
such controversial
manifestations

01:29:48.634 --> 01:29:50.970
as those which have made
Simon Silver famous.

01:29:51.053 --> 01:29:53.639
<i>We really have to wonder if the</i>
<i>spectators presently witnessing</i>

01:29:53.723 --> 01:29:56.309
<i>the final chance to see Simon</i>
<i>Silver will get' what' they paid-</i>

01:30:20.291 --> 01:30:23.294
Why have you
come here tonight?

01:30:25.129 --> 01:30:27.423
What are you
hoping to see?

01:30:27.506 --> 01:30:31.135
Do you think I
should surprise you?

01:30:31.218 --> 01:30:35.306
Do you think I
should entertain you?

01:30:35.389 --> 01:30:40.311
What are you
looking at so closely?

01:30:40.394 --> 01:30:42.396
What do you know about me?
How much do you believe?

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:44.857
How much do
you want to believe?

01:30:44.941 --> 01:30:48.444
I can feel your longings,
your desires...

01:30:48.527 --> 01:30:51.364
I can feel your demands.

01:30:51.447 --> 01:30:54.533
It is a deep, painful
urgency of the animal

01:30:54.617 --> 01:30:56.535
forced to live in darkness

01:30:56.619 --> 01:30:59.956
which finally opens his eyes
and voraciously demands light

01:31:00.039 --> 01:31:03.209
with a howl of rage!

01:31:03.292 --> 01:31:05.461
What is it
you've come to see?

01:31:05.544 --> 01:31:07.088
This?

01:31:10.508 --> 01:31:12.969
Have you come to see this?

01:31:17.473 --> 01:31:19.809
I feel my veins burning

01:31:19.892 --> 01:31:24.438
with the fire
of a new understanding!

01:31:32.989 --> 01:31:35.074
We called Ptolemy insane,

01:31:35.157 --> 01:31:37.827
we spat in the face of Galileo,

01:31:37.910 --> 01:31:40.913
we burned Giordano Bruno...

01:31:40.997 --> 01:31:42.957
What did we need?

01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:47.253
What do we need
in order to learn?

01:31:51.674 --> 01:31:54.051
What makes us
be what we are?

01:31:54.135 --> 01:31:58.639
What finally makes
us come to accept?

01:31:58.723 --> 01:32:01.142
What makes us believe?

01:32:01.225 --> 01:32:07.898
The question is:
Why did you come here...

01:32:07.982 --> 01:32:09.734
today?

01:32:09.817 --> 01:32:12.403
Are you crazy? I shouldn't
even be talking to you.

01:32:12.486 --> 01:32:13.988
Wait, wait, Ben,
I'm not against you.

01:32:14.071 --> 01:32:15.489
I--I just need to
know what you've got.

01:32:15.573 --> 01:32:17.074
You're my student
too, remember?

01:32:17.158 --> 01:32:18.576
Dr. Shackleton,
you know I can't talk.

01:32:18.659 --> 01:32:20.703
Listen, Ben,
I've always respected

01:32:20.786 --> 01:32:22.538
Dr. Buckley's work,
and Dr. Matheson's.

01:32:22.621 --> 01:32:24.165
I'm not the enemy.

01:32:24.248 --> 01:32:26.083
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I'm going to hang up.

01:32:26.167 --> 01:32:27.877
Ben, I've got the results
of nine days of experiments

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:29.128
sitting right
here in front of me.

01:32:29.211 --> 01:32:30.755
Definitive results.

01:32:30.838 --> 01:32:33.090
The only thing missing
is my signature.

01:32:33.174 --> 01:32:36.385
I'm talking about the scientific
verification of extrasensory perception

01:32:36.469 --> 01:32:39.555
and forces which until today have
only been seen as para-science...

01:32:39.638 --> 01:32:41.640
I can imagine.

01:32:41.724 --> 01:32:43.392
Do you have any idea what the
publication of these results

01:32:43.476 --> 01:32:44.977
will mean to Dr. Buckley
and his department?

01:32:45.061 --> 01:32:46.645
Yeah, I--I guess.

01:32:46.729 --> 01:32:48.064
Ben, if we've got
anything wrong, anything,

01:32:48.147 --> 01:32:50.608
I need to know.

01:32:50.691 --> 01:32:52.610
What have you got?

01:32:52.693 --> 01:32:53.486
Nothing.

01:32:53.569 --> 01:32:56.864
What?

01:32:56.947 --> 01:33:01.452
- What do you mean?
- We got...

01:33:01.535 --> 01:33:02.578
nothing.

01:33:11.045 --> 01:33:13.047
Final call,
we'd better get going.

01:33:13.130 --> 01:33:15.299
I hope the second half
is better than the first.

01:33:15.382 --> 01:33:17.843
I didn't spend 300
bucks to see Hamlet.

01:34:18.154 --> 01:34:20.239
- Sally!
- Ben? What are you doing here?

01:34:20.322 --> 01:34:22.575
Shit, Sally, you don't know
how pleased I am to see you.

01:34:22.658 --> 01:34:24.034
Tom told me
you'd be here.

01:34:24.118 --> 01:34:25.911
You should be
doing this, not me.

01:34:25.995 --> 01:34:28.122
What are you doing here?
Where is Tom? He's not home

01:34:28.205 --> 01:34:30.666
and he's not answering his phone.
Did something happen to him?

01:34:30.749 --> 01:34:32.668
Is that SPCR?

01:34:32.751 --> 01:34:34.712
Telepathy booths. I've been
watching the same images.

01:34:34.795 --> 01:34:36.839
- If you want my opinion...
- Ben, I don't. Where is Tom?

01:34:36.922 --> 01:34:38.632
With Silver, I think.

01:34:38.716 --> 01:34:40.593
- What do you mean with Silver?
- At the theater.

01:34:40.676 --> 01:34:42.428
It's nothing out
of the ordinary.

01:34:42.511 --> 01:34:43.679
He wants you to wait for him
here, so take a seat.

01:34:43.762 --> 01:34:46.098
He's perfectly all right.

01:35:40.402 --> 01:35:41.654
What's that?

01:35:41.737 --> 01:35:43.906
- What's what?
- That. There.

01:35:43.989 --> 01:35:45.532
His watch?

01:35:45.616 --> 01:35:47.076
Why would
Silver wear a watch?

01:35:47.159 --> 01:35:48.744
Blind people wear
watches too.

01:35:48.827 --> 01:35:50.120
They tell the time
by touching the hands.

01:35:50.204 --> 01:35:51.538
They checked it.
It's clean.

01:35:51.622 --> 01:35:52.456
Can you split
the image in two?

01:37:09.742 --> 01:37:11.827
- What are you looking for?
- I don't know yet.

01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:15.122
Put the sender on the left
and Silver on the right.

01:37:15.205 --> 01:37:16.582
That's it.

01:37:16.665 --> 01:37:18.584
Move in on the watches.

01:37:18.667 --> 01:37:20.377
- Can you do that?
- On the watches? Sure. Give me a sec.

01:37:22.212 --> 01:37:23.547
I can't get an angle.

01:37:23.630 --> 01:37:28.052
Let me try with
another camera.

01:37:28.135 --> 01:37:29.762
Can you
improve the quality?

01:37:29.845 --> 01:37:31.597
Mm-hm. Sure. I can
amplify a single pixel,

01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:33.057
click it up
with my magic

01:37:33.140 --> 01:37:34.558
and make it so
bright and shiny

01:37:34.641 --> 01:37:35.851
you need sunglasses
to look at it.

01:37:35.934 --> 01:37:37.436
This ain't a movie.

01:37:37.519 --> 01:37:38.937
We're in
the psychology department.

01:37:39.021 --> 01:37:40.939
All right.
Go to the other camera.

01:37:42.775 --> 01:37:43.692
I'd like to know
what the hell is--

01:37:43.776 --> 01:37:45.402
There! Stop!

01:37:45.486 --> 01:37:47.196
Shit, Sally. It's a
recording, you know?

01:37:47.279 --> 01:37:48.572
We can go back and forth
as much as we want.

01:37:48.655 --> 01:37:50.574
We can chill out.

01:37:50.657 --> 01:37:52.409
- Are you sure they're synchronized?
- Yes.

01:37:52.493 --> 01:37:54.411
- Completely?
- Completely.

01:37:54.495 --> 01:37:56.705
What are you looking for? They
don't have the same time.

01:37:56.789 --> 01:37:58.707
What are the chances
that Silver and the sender

01:37:58.791 --> 01:38:00.542
are both wearing
analogical watches

01:38:00.626 --> 01:38:02.836
and that both are
synchronized second by second

01:38:02.920 --> 01:38:04.713
in millimetric precision?

01:38:04.797 --> 01:38:06.590
Synchronized? Didn't you
hear what I just said?

01:38:06.673 --> 01:38:08.258
The watches don't tell
the same time.

01:38:08.342 --> 01:38:11.428
Second by second.

01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:16.392
Shit. It's a code.

01:38:38.330 --> 01:38:40.457
They divide.

01:38:40.541 --> 01:38:41.834
They just have to divide the dial
of the watch into ten sections,

01:38:41.917 --> 01:38:43.794
one for each number.

01:38:43.877 --> 01:38:45.838
When the second hand reaches
the corresponding section--

01:38:45.921 --> 01:38:47.756
--the sender presses
the button.

01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:49.508
Silver just has to know
where the second hand is

01:38:49.591 --> 01:38:51.301
when he hears the signal

01:38:51.385 --> 01:38:52.678
and translate it
to the position.

01:38:52.761 --> 01:38:54.221
They're in it together.

01:38:54.304 --> 01:38:56.640
Dr. Buckley was right.
It's a fraud.

01:38:56.723 --> 01:38:57.933
Silver never
touched the hands.

01:38:58.016 --> 01:38:59.476
The simpler,
the better.

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:00.978
Okay, it's right here
in front of us.

01:39:01.061 --> 01:39:03.021
What was it Matheson
used to say?

01:39:03.105 --> 01:39:05.691
Results appear when there
is defective methodology,

01:39:05.774 --> 01:39:07.443
important data is
inadvertently included...

01:39:07.526 --> 01:39:10.320
...or improper controls
are in place.

01:39:10.404 --> 01:39:14.283
They've taken
something for granted.

01:39:14.366 --> 01:39:15.951
Oh, shit.

01:39:16.034 --> 01:39:17.119
Silver can see.

01:39:31.884 --> 01:39:33.343
Simon Silver!

01:39:37.347 --> 01:39:41.560
Simon Silver.

01:39:41.643 --> 01:39:43.520
Did you really
need to go this far?

01:39:43.604 --> 01:39:45.105
You will
know the truth,

01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:47.065
but the truth will
make you furious.

01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:49.109
Ladies and gentlemen, and
I don't think I'm wrong

01:39:49.193 --> 01:39:50.777
when I say

01:39:50.861 --> 01:39:52.738
we have a distinguished
guest amongst us.

01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:55.324
It's okay.

01:39:55.407 --> 01:39:57.784
The young and persistent
Thomas Buckley,

01:39:57.868 --> 01:39:59.578
as many of you
may know,

01:39:59.661 --> 01:40:02.372
decided some time ago
to devote part of his life

01:40:02.456 --> 01:40:05.834
to making mine
as difficult as possible.

01:40:05.918 --> 01:40:08.378
Am I going too far

01:40:08.462 --> 01:40:10.923
if I say he seems
somewhat out of sorts?

01:40:11.006 --> 01:40:13.300
I wasn't able.

01:40:13.383 --> 01:40:17.804
In the end I
just wasn't able.

01:40:17.888 --> 01:40:19.765
But you know that,
don't you?

01:40:22.684 --> 01:40:25.020
You can't deny yourself.

01:40:25.103 --> 01:40:29.983
You can't live
in denial forever!

01:40:30.067 --> 01:40:32.444
I tried with
all my strength.

01:40:37.616 --> 01:40:41.662
Today it will be over.

01:40:41.745 --> 01:40:43.872
For you and for me.

01:40:43.956 --> 01:40:46.917
- I just hope we're both ready.
- You're a fool, Buckley.

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.961
Are you threatening me
in front of everyone?

01:40:49.044 --> 01:40:51.797
I'm not like you. You can't hurt me.
I am the life force!

01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:54.967
I come with the wind
and I go with the wind.

01:40:55.050 --> 01:40:56.969
Do you want me
to hurt you?

01:40:57.052 --> 01:40:58.804
Get out of here
now while you can.

01:40:58.887 --> 01:41:00.681
I don't want to
interrupt anything

01:41:00.764 --> 01:41:02.933
but I'd really
like to sit down.

01:41:03.016 --> 01:41:05.644
My arm is hurting.

01:41:05.727 --> 01:41:09.064
Then put it down. There's
nothing stopping you.

01:41:09.147 --> 01:41:12.317
I just--just I--
I simply can't.

01:41:18.031 --> 01:41:21.660
Don't believe everything
they tell you.

01:41:21.743 --> 01:41:23.954
You'd be better
off sitting down.

01:41:30.043 --> 01:41:32.129
Buckley, how dare you?

01:41:32.212 --> 01:41:35.048
Are you challenging me? Are
you questioning my power?

01:41:35.132 --> 01:41:37.050
We fill our
heads with noise.

01:41:37.134 --> 01:41:39.678
Stay where you are. Do
you want me to hurt you?

01:41:39.761 --> 01:41:44.891
We renounce ever
knowing ourselves.

01:41:44.975 --> 01:41:48.270
But you can't deny
yourself forever.

01:41:48.353 --> 01:41:49.187
Isn't that right?

01:41:49.271 --> 01:41:51.064
Buckley!

01:41:51.148 --> 01:41:53.692
Don't you dare
ignore me!

01:41:53.775 --> 01:41:56.653
Time goes on.

01:41:56.737 --> 01:41:59.615
And you think you have
all the time in the world,

01:41:59.698 --> 01:42:01.033
that nothing is final...

01:42:01.116 --> 01:42:02.784
But time goes on.

01:42:02.868 --> 01:42:04.494
Stay where you are.
Don't take another step.

01:42:04.578 --> 01:42:05.871
You're playing with fire,
I'm telling you.

01:42:05.954 --> 01:42:07.581
You're playing
with fire!

01:42:07.664 --> 01:42:10.250
But in the end, so much
time has gone by--

01:42:10.334 --> 01:42:12.794
And you know you should
have done something,

01:42:12.878 --> 01:42:14.713
and then you wake up.

01:42:14.796 --> 01:42:17.090
Don't you know the kind of
force you're up against?

01:42:17.174 --> 01:42:18.759
It's already over.

01:42:18.842 --> 01:42:20.761
- Stay where you are!
- Margaret never knew.

01:42:20.844 --> 01:42:22.220
I don't think you don't know
what you're up against.

01:42:22.304 --> 01:42:24.139
I never told her.
She never knew.

01:42:24.222 --> 01:42:25.515
Don't come any closer.

01:42:25.599 --> 01:42:27.142
And now
everything is a lie!

01:42:27.225 --> 01:42:29.353
Don't come any closer!
I'm warning you!

01:42:29.436 --> 01:42:32.814
Did you know all along, Simon Silver?
Did you know?

01:42:32.898 --> 01:42:34.650
Buckley! Buckley!

01:42:34.733 --> 01:42:37.527
That's all I want to know.
Did you know all along?

01:42:37.611 --> 01:42:39.029
Buckley!

01:42:40.197 --> 01:42:40.822
Buckley!

01:42:43.283 --> 01:42:45.118
Buckley!

01:44:05.490 --> 01:44:07.367
How did you do that?

01:44:27.721 --> 01:44:29.306
Phoney.

01:44:34.394 --> 01:44:35.729
How did you do that?

01:44:38.356 --> 01:44:40.525
<i>Simon, come with me.</i>

01:44:40.609 --> 01:44:42.652
How did
you do that?

01:44:47.449 --> 01:44:49.534
How did you do that?

01:45:13.391 --> 01:45:15.769
<i>Dear Margaret,</i>

01:45:15.852 --> 01:45:23.318
<i>Even today / 'm not exactly</i>
<i>sure when everything ended.</i>

01:45:23.401 --> 01:45:29.199
<i>I wanted to cry,</i>
<i>to feel anger, grief I</i>

01:45:29.282 --> 01:45:32.536
<i>to feel,</i>

01:45:32.619 --> 01:45:34.704
<i>just' like I used to</i>

01:45:38.208 --> 01:45:42.379
<i>A whole life</i>
<i>denying myself,</i>

01:45:42.462 --> 01:45:45.590
<i>searching in silence</i>
<i>for someone like me.</i>

01:45:48.635 --> 01:45:52.097
<i>A whole life</i>
<i>looking for an answer,</i>

01:45:55.058 --> 01:45:56.893
<i>without finding it</i>

01:46:03.441 --> 01:46:05.986
<i>I /earned so many things</i>
<i>from you-</i>

01:46:09.406 --> 01:46:13.410
<i>But' I forgot'</i>
<i>the most' essential thing</i>

01:46:13.493 --> 01:46:15.996
How did you know that?

01:46:16.079 --> 01:46:18.290
Because I'm psychic.

01:46:18.373 --> 01:46:19.374
Silver?

01:46:20.792 --> 01:46:23.086
It was me all along,

01:46:26.464 --> 01:46:28.049
wasn't it, Margaret?

01:46:28.133 --> 01:46:30.468
Where did
you spring from?

01:46:30.552 --> 01:46:32.345
Why are you with me?

01:46:32.429 --> 01:46:34.264
It was me...

01:46:38.351 --> 01:46:39.352
all along.

01:46:43.815 --> 01:46:46.484
You can't deny
yourself forever.

01:46:46.568 --> 01:46:50.655
You did most of the magic
by looking in the wrong place.

01:46:52.449 --> 01:46:54.784
I did what
you'd have wanted.

01:46:54.868 --> 01:47:04.419
But I'll never forgive myself
for not revealing myself,

01:47:04.502 --> 01:47:08.548
for not at least giving
you the consolation

01:47:08.632 --> 01:47:10.258
of knowing...
