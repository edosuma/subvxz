DAMON: Previously on
The Vampire Diaries...

00:04.440 --> 00:05.566
DAMON: She has Elena.

00:05.760 --> 00:07.285
And I'm the only one
who knows where she is.

00:07.560 --> 00:10.211
Oscar's been gone days running
your errands, but we're stuck here,

00:10.440 --> 00:11.521
starving ourselves,

00:11.720 --> 00:13.563
pretending like we're not
the strongest people on the planet.

00:13.760 --> 00:15.524
I don't want to be
a part of Lily's cavalry.

00:15.720 --> 00:16.767
I just wanna have fun.

00:16.960 --> 00:19.486
You will not lay a hand on
another member of my family.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.165
Give me Elena, you get your son back.

00:21.360 --> 00:23.681
Once you bury a body,
the grieving process begins.

00:23.880 --> 00:25.291
Oh, I'm not planning on burying her.

00:25.480 --> 00:28.086
The Phoenix Stone brings people
back from the dead.

00:28.280 --> 00:30.123
- Tell me you'll try.
- I'll try.

00:30.320 --> 00:31.481
What was the deal with you and Stefan?

00:31.680 --> 00:33.728
I was the first love of Stefan's life.

00:33.920 --> 00:36.571
CAROLINE: You put that spell on me
so Stefan couldn't touch me.

00:36.800 --> 00:38.086
It's like your skin is vervain.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.327
Stefan, meet Julian.

00:39.560 --> 00:42.291
Julian was the man you are
not supposed to fall for.

00:42.520 --> 00:45.569
Does Stefan Salvatore know that
you are pregnant with his child?

00:45.800 --> 00:47.040
(JULIAN GRUNTS)

00:47.240 --> 00:48.844
So, have you found Julian yet?

00:49.040 --> 00:50.087
I found him months ago.

00:50.320 --> 00:53.961
Julian is the devil.
I can't let Lily bring him back.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.569
Oh, damn it.

01:31.760 --> 01:33.808
-(SIGHS)
- Is it fixed yet?

01:34.520 --> 01:38.241
Not yet, sweetheart.
And it's past your bedtime.

01:38.440 --> 01:39.566
BOTH: No!

01:39.760 --> 01:41.330
Yes, it is. You wanna go brush your teeth?

01:41.520 --> 01:42.965
BOTH: (GIGGLING) No!

01:43.200 --> 01:44.645
Yeah, well, too bad.

01:46.440 --> 01:49.205
Surgery will have to resume tomorrow.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.890
All right, Josie,
help your sister find her PJs, okay?

01:57.520 --> 01:58.806
Girls?

02:29.040 --> 02:30.690
Damon.

02:30.920 --> 02:33.207
Well, aren't you adorable? (CHUCKLES)

02:34.160 --> 02:35.571
The girls, too.

02:37.040 --> 02:38.530
Stand behind Daddy.

02:38.760 --> 02:40.171
Why so gloomy?

02:40.360 --> 02:42.010
Looks like you got everything you wanted.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.009
The fact that you're here
means somebody died.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.440
No. Not yet.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.889
But if you don't do exactly as I say,
that can change real fast.

02:50.240 --> 02:51.526
So.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.171
You gonna invite me in?

03:15.560 --> 03:16.891
Geez.

03:17.840 --> 03:20.286
You're here. At 5 a.m.

03:20.480 --> 03:23.165
I'm gonna need the place to myself today.

03:23.360 --> 03:24.805
Oh, come on, man.

03:25.280 --> 03:27.169
Don't make me an accomplice to
whatever weird stuff

03:27.360 --> 03:29.089
you're doing with your wife's dead body.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.962
You have no idea how weird it's gonna get.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.840
Is this enough to buy some privacy?

03:41.360 --> 03:43.169
I'm gonna throw in a free reality check.

03:43.760 --> 03:46.764
Preserved bodies
still have an expiration date,

03:46.960 --> 03:48.769
and this is her last day.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.321
She doesn't have to go home,
but she can't stay here.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.286
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

04:01.280 --> 04:03.203
Mother, tell me you have Elena.

04:03.400 --> 04:04.447
LILY: Let me speak to Oscar.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.490
No can do, I'm about to wake him up
from his little vervain nap.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.165
You do realize that when you get her back,

04:09.360 --> 04:10.805
you're not actually
getting her back, right?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.206
She's still in a box.

04:12.400 --> 04:13.811
You think I need to be reminded of that?

04:14.000 --> 04:15.764
And yet you're leveraging
a member of my family

04:15.960 --> 04:17.803
just to get her body closer to you.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.411
How selfish can you be?

04:19.600 --> 04:20.680
Spare me the lecture, Mommy.

04:20.880 --> 04:23.486
Damon. If you have harmed
Oscar in any way...

04:23.680 --> 04:27.446
Yeah, yeah, yeah, say good-bye to Elena.
It's not my first hostage swap.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.326
(BEEPS)

(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

04:35.400 --> 04:36.640
Uh-oh.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.363

04:41.240 --> 04:42.810
I smell the blood on you, buddy.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.480
Huh?

05:01.560 --> 05:02.800
You gotta be kidding me.

05:11.600 --> 05:12.840
(CAROLINE MOANS)

05:13.680 --> 05:14.761
I didn't want to wake you.

05:15.040 --> 05:20.126
Well, I would lose more sleep
if you just snuck out without saying hi.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.047
Hi.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.480
Mmm. I missed this.

05:26.760 --> 05:27.807
Am I gonna catch fire?

05:28.040 --> 05:31.089
No. I just can't touch vampires.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.966
Valerie basically turned
my skin into vervain.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.730
I'll work on unraveling the spell
when I get back.

05:35.920 --> 05:38.491
Stop. We have so much to catch up on.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.569
Let's just go shopping
for Halloween costumes

05:40.760 --> 05:42.808
and we can worry about magic later.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.651
I'm kind of already worrying
about magic today.

05:46.240 --> 05:49.210
Alaric thinks we can
reunite Jo's spirit with her body

05:49.400 --> 05:51.971
by using some sketchy
Native American resurrection stone.

05:52.200 --> 05:55.807
My job is to crush his dreams
in the most gentle way possible.

05:56.040 --> 05:59.965
Wow. Okay.
You don't even think it'll work?

06:00.160 --> 06:01.844
(CHUCKLES) I don't think it should.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.884
The Other Side is gone,
there's no more Gemini prison worlds,

06:05.080 --> 06:07.048
which means that Jo's spirit is...

06:07.240 --> 06:08.844
Probably at peace.

06:10.320 --> 06:11.606
(SIGHS)

- Tell me about it.
-(CHUCKLES)

06:22.520 --> 06:23.726
How the hell did you let this happen?

06:23.920 --> 06:27.163
Don't even think about blaming this on me.
I'm not the one that unscrewed his heart.

06:27.400 --> 06:29.607
No, you're just the one
who chased him down, kidnapped him

06:29.800 --> 06:31.962
and are still, technically,
holding him hostage.

06:32.200 --> 06:33.406
To get Elena back.

06:33.600 --> 06:34.726
And how's that working out for you?

06:34.920 --> 06:37.571
Because, from where I'm standing,
she's in more danger than ever,

06:37.760 --> 06:38.841
because you won't let her rest.

06:39.080 --> 06:42.368
You spend one day with mommy dearest
and now you're on her side?

06:42.560 --> 06:44.369
I don't have to be on her side to see
what's happening here.

06:44.560 --> 06:49.088
You can't be with Elena, so you're making
all your bad decisions about Elena.

06:52.800 --> 06:53.926
We need to get rid of this body.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.963
No,no,no.
You need to get rid of this body.

06:56.640 --> 06:57.880
(SCOFFS)

07:05.160 --> 07:07.447
Brekkie. What are we having?

07:07.640 --> 07:09.529
Mushroom omelets.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.409
Hey, they're for Oscar, not you.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.126
He's coming home today.

07:15.320 --> 07:18.529
I'm impressed. Especially considering
how late you got home last night.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.405
- Where's Oscar?
- I don't know.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.726
Damon never showed up.

07:27.960 --> 07:31.601
I suppose I've taken the notion of trust
for granted lately.

07:33.680 --> 07:37.605
Lorenzo, would you mind terribly
if I had a moment alone with Valerie?

07:37.840 --> 07:39.330
Is something wrong?

07:39.560 --> 07:41.164
Just some family business.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.490
I spent yesterday with Stefan.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.843
Learned all about your little tryst
in 1863.

07:56.280 --> 07:59.363
(SIGHS) We were children. It was...

08:00.320 --> 08:02.800
It was puppy love. It meant nothing.

08:03.040 --> 08:08.126
Hmm. Right. That explains why you held on
to his journal all these years.

08:08.720 --> 08:12.202
You were fragile at the time.
I didn't want to upset you.

08:12.520 --> 08:16.491
You told him you were coming back for him,
and he believed you.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.690
Why put him through that?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.446
I was a foolish human back then.

08:26.040 --> 08:27.451
I'm sorry.

08:28.160 --> 08:29.730
I will only say this once.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.605
If you have anything to tell me,

08:32.799 --> 08:34.688
anything at all,

08:34.880 --> 08:36.405
now is the time.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.727
I have nothing to hide.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.405
I should go look for Oscar.

08:45.600 --> 08:47.090
That won't be necessary.

08:48.240 --> 08:50.208
NORA: God, it feels good to get out
of that deserted town

08:50.400 --> 08:52.482
and be around living,
breathing people we can eat.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.247
Mystic Falls is a prison world
all over again.

08:55.440 --> 08:58.330

09:21.560 --> 09:22.925
How sad.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.171
Not as sad as being exiled here
by your own mother.

09:26.360 --> 09:28.601
Lily must have had the wrong address
for the hostage exchange.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.484
- Hmm.
- Where's Oscar?

09:30.680 --> 09:32.045

Oscar turned the tables,
and he knocked me out and he took off.

09:55.520 --> 09:58.444
I lost my one and only bargaining chip.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.529
Then why isn't Oscar answering his phone?

13:22.040 --> 13:25.487
considering that she's the reason
why I literally can't touch you.

13:25.680 --> 13:29.401
Unfortunately, she's the heretic that I am
the least concerned about right now.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.170
Oh, God. Who now?

13:31.360 --> 13:33.488
Let's just say that it involves
two bored mean girls,

13:33.680 --> 13:35.569
and a campus full of easy targets.

13:35.760 --> 13:39.731
But fortunately, I have come up
with a genius plan

13:39.960 --> 13:43.043
to keep them occupied while
Damon sorts out his Oscar problem.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.291
- The dance.
- Mmm-hmm.

13:46.520 --> 13:47.567
Full of potential victims.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.689
And distractions. All in one place.

13:49.880 --> 13:52.884
Easy to babysit. I think the hardest part
will be feigning enthusiasm.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.162
Yeah, they'll never fall for it.

13:56.720 --> 13:59.041
Unless they think it's their idea.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.209
I'm getting hungry.
Is it death o'clock yet?

14:09.240 --> 14:11.561
We still have thirteen minutes.

14:12.800 --> 14:15.167
- What's this?
- Oh. Nothing.

14:15.360 --> 14:17.840
It's, it's just some
silly Heaven and Hell ball.

14:18.080 --> 14:19.969
Stefan invited me, but I don't know.

14:20.160 --> 14:24.290
These days, Halloween just seems
like an excuse to get drunk and show skin.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.408
Sorry, no heretics allowed.

14:28.760 --> 14:31.445
Halloween's only for people
who dress up as psychopaths.

14:31.760 --> 14:33.808
As if we'd want to drink
cheap beer out of plastic

14:34.000 --> 14:36.207
and then brag about it
all over the Internet.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.165
As if you'd even know how to do that.
We're going.

14:39.360 --> 14:40.964
To a college party?

14:41.160 --> 14:42.605
Oh. Okay.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.444
(CHUCKLES) Good luck With that.

14:45.280 --> 14:46.566
What's that supposed to mean?

14:47.280 --> 14:50.602
Nothing. No, you two
will fit in just fine.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.883
I mean, seriously, you guys have
nothing to feel self-conscious about.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.770
Did I say you could leave?

15:01.280 --> 15:02.566
What do you want?

15:08.280 --> 15:11.011
I see you found a dress. From my closet.

15:12.480 --> 15:15.165
Haven't been to a party
since New Year's, 1902.

15:15.960 --> 15:18.691
Be honest.
Will I make a proper modern devil?

15:20.720 --> 15:23.929
Shouldn't be too much
of a stretch. (CHUCKLES)

15:24.400 --> 15:25.890
Unlike the hips of that dress.

15:28.640 --> 15:31.325
Would you prefer I chose a different one
and dyed it with your blood?

15:32.760 --> 15:35.684
Look, I gave you an outfit.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.046
Now it's your turn.

15:37.240 --> 15:40.130
Siphon off this annoying
anti-vampire spell.

15:40.720 --> 15:42.245
Aw. Are you prohibited from

15:42.440 --> 15:44.807
showing physical affection
for your significant other?

15:45.040 --> 15:46.849
Try being gay in nineteen hundred.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.008
What do you care about some silly spell?

15:49.200 --> 15:50.281
You don't even like Valerie.

15:50.480 --> 15:51.970
You're right. I don't.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.766
I've had to endure two lifetimes
with that conniving shrew.

15:54.960 --> 15:56.724
And I've learned that
when it comes to Val,

15:57.680 --> 15:59.091
you don't get on her bad side.

16:08.640 --> 16:10.369
(SIGHS) Not happening, Stefan.

16:10.560 --> 16:12.722
Look, if I siphon Caroline's spell,
Valerie will find out,

16:12.920 --> 16:15.446
and she'll retaliate
with something much worse.

16:15.640 --> 16:17.165
The girl is a rancid bitch.

16:17.520 --> 16:18.567
That's not the Valerie that I knew.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.286
Well, I used to be a sickly,
abused little urchin,

16:21.480 --> 16:23.608
cast out by my coven, and...

16:23.800 --> 16:25.131
Then I met Mary Louise.

16:25.800 --> 16:27.211
Love changes people.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.810
I mean, maybe Valerie's obsession with you

16:30.000 --> 16:32.367
is the reason why
she's a walking funeral dirge.

16:33.080 --> 16:34.445
MARY: Oh, Nora!

16:35.480 --> 16:36.766
Well?

16:39.360 --> 16:41.044
Hmm. Not bad.

16:41.760 --> 16:43.000
"Not bad" is not "good."

16:43.200 --> 16:44.531
No, you look nice, it's just...

16:45.800 --> 16:47.290
Kinda plain.

16:47.520 --> 16:48.885
But I can sex it up for you.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.844
I'm comfortable like this, Nora, don't...

16:51.040 --> 16:52.451
Stop it!

16:52.720 --> 16:55.007
Come on, you're supposed to be a devil.

16:55.240 --> 16:57.686
- You want a devil?
-(G ROANS)

17:01.520 --> 17:04.842
It's fifteen minutes past the hour.
Distraction period over.

17:05.079 --> 17:06.650
Mary Lou. Wait!

17:12.480 --> 17:14.642
Well, what better way
to spend Halloween, huh?

17:14.880 --> 17:17.690
Why would I want to go
to some stupid Halloween party

17:17.880 --> 17:19.928
like a normal student,
and maybe meet a nice guy,

17:20.119 --> 17:23.169
or not-so-nice guy, have a fun,
drunk Halloween hookup,

17:23.359 --> 17:24.646
when I can be here,

17:25.200 --> 17:26.486
struggling to raise the dead?

17:26.760 --> 17:31.368
Well, if it makes any difference,
this is worth some serious extra credit.

17:31.560 --> 17:32.800
Oh, you think?

17:34.160 --> 17:36.766
Whether or not I'm capable,
you're lucky I'm willing.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.883

scare the hell out of me,

bring this guy back to life.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.444
You weren't, oh, I don't know,

18:21.640 --> 18:24.769
already coming to this
and just forgot to invite me?

18:24.960 --> 18:27.122
I didn't forget to invite you.

18:27.320 --> 18:32.008
I just felt like a Halloween party
wasn't great first-date material.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.450
So then, this isn't our first date?

18:34.640 --> 18:35.926
Well, it depends.

18:36.320 --> 18:37.731
What do you think it is?

18:41.840 --> 18:43.126
Torture.

18:46.720 --> 18:47.960
Oh, they're here.

18:49.160 --> 18:51.891
- Guess it's time for us to babysit.
- Mmm-hmm.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.250
Hi, girls. What can I get you?

18:59.440 --> 19:04.162
A Bijou for me and a Creme Yvette
for my little flower here.

19:04.360 --> 19:07.250
(CHUCKLES) I'm sorry,
I have no idea what that is.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.727
A gin martini and a Sex On The Beach.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.325
Got you.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.970
So, let me guess.

19:16.440 --> 19:20.001
Old-fashioned devil and slutty angel.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.009
- I love it.
- Beg your pardon?

19:22.200 --> 19:25.602
Thanks. It's cobbled together
with stuff I found on Pinterest.

19:25.800 --> 19:27.609
Oh, my God, Pinterest. I love Pinterest.

19:27.800 --> 19:28.961
I get half my recipes from it.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.491

Hey. You're not the only one
banking on this.

20:05.320 --> 20:08.927
It's not for me, Ric. Why does everything
have to be about me today?

20:09.120 --> 20:10.929
Will both of you just shut up?

20:11.120 --> 20:12.281
The stone works.

20:12.520 --> 20:15.046
I think it's creating a bridge between
the body and the spirit.

20:15.240 --> 20:18.881
I just have to find a spell
that makes that bridge permanent.

Caroline and I have saved. Barely.

So, did you just call to brag?

Oh, crap! Ric, put it out!

Ah, there's the mopey face
I've come to know and love.

20:55.160 --> 20:58.528
I guess all it takes is
a scolding from Lily to ruin breakfast.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.284
We have an icebox
full of blood downstairs, you know.

21:03.480 --> 21:05.403
Yeah, but sometimes
it's nice to get out of the house.

21:05.600 --> 21:10.322
Take a drive. Get out of town.
Come back. Wouldn't you agree?

21:10.720 --> 21:14.247
Clearly, I'm not as quick
as the other orphans in the workhouse.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.283
Are you accusing me of something?

21:18.320 --> 21:19.845
Town surveillance has you on the road

21:20.040 --> 21:22.327
to and from Whitmore
last night in a stolen car.

21:23.400 --> 21:26.404
Curious how Oscar
was also at Whitmore last night

21:26.600 --> 21:28.841
and has since mysteriously disappeared.

21:29.040 --> 21:30.280
So... (SCOFFS)

21:30.920 --> 21:33.605
Yes, I am accusing you of something.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.770
I'm just not sure whether
it's lying to Lily, murder,

21:36.960 --> 21:38.200
or both.

21:39.600 --> 21:42.683
Forget everything you think you know.

21:43.520 --> 21:46.285
Because you are wrong in ways
you cannot even imagine.

21:47.200 --> 21:48.645
Enlighten me.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.969
What exactly don't I know?

21:53.680 --> 21:56.570
(SCOFFS) Or maybe it's easier
if I just ask Lily.

21:56.760 --> 22:00.321
And I'm sure she'll be eager to uncover
the truth and punish you for it.

22:01.440 --> 22:02.930
I killed Oscar.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.050
He knew too much.

22:05.240 --> 22:08.403
I had to prevent him from bringing
a monster back into Lily's life.

22:09.080 --> 22:10.320
What monster is that?

22:11.320 --> 22:12.606
Julian.

22:14.520 --> 22:15.760
You don't know?

22:19.320 --> 22:21.527
I guess Lily doesn't tell you everything.

22:23.240 --> 22:25.004
Who's Julian, Valerie?

22:27.120 --> 22:29.566
Someone you'll want to keep
as far away as possible.

you want Lily to love you

if she gives it to her,

that Nora's gonna leave her.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.160
Figured you might.

26:40.440 --> 26:41.771
Either our friend still has the munchies

26:41.960 --> 26:45.248
or this ravenous hunger
is a side effect of resurrection.

26:45.440 --> 26:47.966
Don't look at me.
I barely understand how the guy is alive.

26:48.160 --> 26:52.848
If hunger is the worst consequence
of the stone spell, then we got off easy.

26:54.600 --> 26:55.886
You sure you wanna do this to Jo?

26:56.080 --> 26:57.127
Look, it's now or never, Damon.

26:57.320 --> 26:59.163
No offense, Ric, but I was asking Bonnie.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.520
Look at you sad-sacks.

27:03.760 --> 27:05.603
What, am I gonna say no?

27:05.800 --> 27:07.768
Damon, go get your girl.

27:08.600 --> 27:09.931
I'll get his.

27:15.920 --> 27:17.649
Trick or treat?

27:17.840 --> 27:19.683
I've been tricked enough today.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.887
Still haven't heard a peep
from the girls since they left.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.280
(SIGHS)

27:29.480 --> 27:30.970
Who's Julian?

27:31.840 --> 27:32.966
Where did you hear that name?

27:33.200 --> 27:34.929
I've heard a lot of names
in this house since I moved in.

27:35.120 --> 27:38.249
But Julian, that's a new one.

27:38.440 --> 27:40.841
Which means your family isn't talking
about him for a reason.

27:41.040 --> 27:42.371
Well, that's nonsense.

27:43.680 --> 27:46.684
No one who ever met Julian
would dare say a bad thing about him.

27:46.880 --> 27:48.120
He was a saint.

27:50.560 --> 27:52.369
He was the love of my life.

27:54.680 --> 27:55.920
Was?

27:57.400 --> 27:58.640
Or is?

28:00.760 --> 28:02.000
(CELL PHONE CHIMES)

28:03.760 --> 28:05.444
Damon found Oscar.

28:25.560 --> 28:28.723
- Get out of my way.
- Why? You're done here.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.604
That's excellent news.

28:35.280 --> 28:36.770
Where's Nora?

28:37.720 --> 28:39.131
I don't know.

28:40.320 --> 28:41.560
We had a fight.

28:45.560 --> 28:48.131
- I'm sorry.
- Do not pity me.

28:49.920 --> 28:51.763
Trust me, I don't.

28:53.160 --> 28:55.527
Is this how relationships work
in the modern era?

28:55.720 --> 28:58.246
Everybody peddling their flesh
like a street bazaar?

28:59.320 --> 29:02.290
Because bloody Nora seems
quite interested in the browsing.

29:03.360 --> 29:07.809
You know, these days they have
this wonderful thing called a therapist.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.645
How old do you think I am?

29:11.560 --> 29:15.451
I can think of nothing more futile
than prattling on about one's emotions.

29:15.640 --> 29:20.043
As if I can prevent Nora from drifting
away if I only find the right words.

29:20.800 --> 29:27.809
Or as if confronting my first love
will somehow make her disappear.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.762
Caroline thinks that
Valerie's mere existence

29:30.960 --> 29:33.486
is somehow sabotaging our relationship.

29:33.680 --> 29:36.126
But if she could just get into my head,

29:36.320 --> 29:39.483
she would see that the only thing
standing between me and my girlfriend

29:39.880 --> 29:41.962
is that damn spell.

29:44.280 --> 29:45.520
Which you can remove.

29:49.480 --> 29:52.051
Ah, I got you. Come on, come on.

29:52.240 --> 29:54.811
Will you... Will you slow down, please?

29:55.000 --> 29:57.048
Trust me, you do not want
to make Lily wait.

29:57.240 --> 29:58.287
I learned that the hard way.

29:58.520 --> 30:00.284
Here, this'll take the edge off.

30:00.520 --> 30:02.648
- I'm gonna need more.
- Not till we get our stories straight.

30:02.840 --> 30:05.969
We were in Myrtle Beach.
We were wasted. You passed out.

30:06.200 --> 30:07.486
I've never been to Myrtle Beach.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.489
How deep does this amnesia go?

30:09.680 --> 30:12.365
I just need a little more, okay? Just...

30:12.560 --> 30:14.050
Just a taste. A drop.

30:14.240 --> 30:15.287
Well, that was the last one.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.970
Well, then you're gonna
have to stop this thing!

30:17.160 --> 30:19.003

who can solve this case for you,
Detective Dumbass.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.007
What happened?

31:14.200 --> 31:16.202
Oscar's acid trip went from bad to worse.

31:16.400 --> 31:17.890
I've been tracking him through the woods.

31:18.080 --> 31:19.206
Damon, it's Halloween.

31:19.400 --> 31:22.404
There'll be ghost tours going through
Mystic Falls every thirty minutes.

31:22.600 --> 31:24.250
Perfect. At least I know where he's going.

31:24.480 --> 31:26.289
I'm coming with you.

31:28.600 --> 31:33.049
Donovan, that badge does not take away
the fact that you are human.

31:33.280 --> 31:36.011
Please don't commit
suicide-by-heretic tonight.

31:36.240 --> 31:37.287
Since when do you care?

31:37.480 --> 31:38.527
Give me a break.

31:38.720 --> 31:42.202
I don't wanna add your death to a long
list of things that are already my fault.

31:44.720 --> 31:47.849
Mar? Mary Lou?

31:48.280 --> 31:49.850
You can't avoid me for...

31:52.760 --> 31:55.206
Siphon the repulsion spell off Caroline,

31:55.400 --> 31:57.084
or your girlfriend dies.

31:57.280 --> 31:59.089
Do you see how easy I made that for you?

31:59.280 --> 32:02.523
Yes, thanks.
Now, let me make it harder for you.

Any questions before
we head to the final stop on our tour?

32:53.840 --> 32:55.922

34:18.440 --> 34:20.806
Of course it matters.
They were going to hurt you.

34:22.560 --> 34:23.800
I'm going to find them
and rip their heads off

No. I'm sorry.

We've been on our own.
Scorned, abused, imprisoned for so long.

34:58.480 --> 35:02.007
I've forgotten this world is meant
to be enjoyed, not feared.

that I've wanted for a really long time,

No, but sometimes I say things
that I don't really need to say,

but I'm just scared that
I'm the only one thinking them.

36:04.320 --> 36:06.368
The reason that
I'm not talking about Valerie

full of corpses in the cemetery

I came here to be alone.

Or you're planning your escape.

Only a matter of time
before Oscar sobers up

37:32.440 --> 37:34.090

- Which, clearly, you're bloody awful at.
- What do you want, Enzo?

37:37.320 --> 37:40.529
I want, dear, not-so-innocent Valerie,

37:40.920 --> 37:43.446
for you to tell me
how we're going to prevent Julian

37:43.640 --> 37:45.369
from walking back into Lily's life.

38:02.680 --> 38:05.331
I've asked Beau to remove
the cloaking spell from Elena's coffin.

38:05.800 --> 38:08.485
You'll find her in the ruins
of the old Salvatore mansion.

38:10.160 --> 38:12.128
Clever. ..ish.

38:12.320 --> 38:14.687
- Glad you think so.
- I'm moving back to Mystic Falls.

38:17.040 --> 38:19.566
I will certainly ask the family to take it
under consideration.

38:19.720 --> 38:20.960
Wasn't a request.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.970

by one of your free-range children.

gonna cut into my social schedule.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.529
And what, you're going to help keep order?

38:32.880 --> 38:35.042
Damon, you can hardly keep
a covered box safe.

38:35.400 --> 38:38.563
You do realize that this innate desire

38:38.800 --> 38:41.167
to keep Elena physically
present in your life,

38:41.360 --> 38:45.524
this boyish refusal to let her go,
will only put her in more danger.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.241
After everything you've been through,

38:47.480 --> 38:48.686
what a shame it would be to lose her

38:48.880 --> 38:51.884
because you're too terrified to find out
who you actually are without her.

38:55.080 --> 38:57.845
If you dare to return to Mystic Falls,
it's no skin off my nose.

38:58.040 --> 38:59.246
I want one more thing.

39:03.720 --> 39:04.926
DAMON: Dear Elena.

39:05.720 --> 39:07.768
Yes, you heard that correctly.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.922
Hell has frozen over.

39:10.400 --> 39:11.606
I'm writing it all down.

39:12.000 --> 39:16.528
Granted, I'm a half-bottle in, thanks
to my 1950 Chéteau Cheval Blanc.

39:17.240 --> 39:20.449
A bottle I waited 65 years to open.

39:20.920 --> 39:23.571
I used to spend nights
sitting in my wine cellar,

39:23.760 --> 39:25.967
convincing myself
I could actually hear it age.

39:26.920 --> 39:29.446
Tannins growing, fermenting.

39:30.040 --> 39:33.203
But appreciating its beauty
didn't make the time go by any faster.

39:34.200 --> 39:38.967
The bottle just laid there on its shelf,
torturing me while I waited for Katherine.

39:39.760 --> 39:41.091
And time stood still.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.760
Eventually, I convinced myself
that no sip of that wine

39:44.960 --> 39:47.566
could ever taste
as good as I dreamt it would.

39:49.400 --> 39:51.880
So, I hid the bottle and walked away.

39:52.240 --> 39:54.720
And that is the story
of why I drink bourbon.

39:57.960 --> 40:00.486
I don't know who I am without you.

40:00.760 --> 40:03.286
But I do know that
as long as I'm with you,

40:03.720 --> 40:05.245
time will stand still.

40:14.280 --> 40:17.443
So who is Damon Salvatore
without Elena Gilbert?

41:04.560 --> 41:07.689
Or maybe, with a little luck,
I'll do right by you.

41:08.840 --> 41:12.845
Because you may be a thousand miles away,
or a hundred years away, but...

41:13.680 --> 41:15.409
You're still here with me.

41:15.640 --> 41:18.211
