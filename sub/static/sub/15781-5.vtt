Hmm.
It needs something...

00:25.025 --> 00:26.493
[short laugh ]

00:26.559 --> 00:28.221
Yes Chuck, it needs...

00:28.294 --> 00:30.695
JAM!

00:33.266 --> 00:35.326
FANCY:
It's all there.

00:35.402 --> 00:37.166
What is this?

00:37.237 --> 00:38.398
Oh, that's a ham sandwich

00:38.471 --> 00:40.997
and a 100 calorie pack
of little Oreos.

00:41.074 --> 00:42.736
Casper here double-crossed us!

00:42.809 --> 00:45.677
[laughter]

[gagging ]

01:02.128 --> 01:04.096
COUNCIL 9:
Intangible Fancy!

01:04.164 --> 01:06.360
We are lenient on murderers.

01:06.433 --> 01:07.924
COUNCIL 1:
We've all been there.

01:08.001 --> 01:11.938
But the penalty for smuggling
contraband is beheading!

01:12.005 --> 01:13.667
Does he have a head?

01:13.740 --> 01:15.299
Can we even get that-
whatever that is-

01:15.375 --> 01:17.037
that head area...off?

01:17.110 --> 01:19.238
COUNCIL 9:
What say you to the charges?

01:19.312 --> 01:22.043
I didn't swallow it.
I dropped it.

01:22.115 --> 01:23.310
COUNCIL 3:
We all saw it!

01:23.383 --> 01:25.648
I mean, you're like
a ghost or something!

01:25.718 --> 01:26.777
You're clear!

01:26.853 --> 01:29.618
Here's something,
I can see Councilman 8.

01:29.689 --> 01:32.921
Yes...
Okay, that's peculiar.

01:32.992 --> 01:34.927
My name is...

01:34.994 --> 01:36.462
Revenge!

01:36.529 --> 01:37.895
COUNCIL 1:
That was odd.

01:37.964 --> 01:39.296
Shouldn't we do something?

01:39.365 --> 01:41.061
These rooms have no alarms
or anything.

01:41.134 --> 01:43.069
I don't even know
where you guys are.

01:43.136 --> 01:45.435
Are we even in the same
building?

01:45.505 --> 01:47.804
COUNCIL 9:
Um...F.Y.I...

01:47.874 --> 01:50.241
It seems that we can now
see Councilman 3.

01:50.310 --> 01:51.642
Oh dear.

01:51.711 --> 01:53.646
Well that can't be good news.

01:53.713 --> 01:56.046
COUNCIL 9:
Am I still in silhouette?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.779
FANCY:
Can I go now?

02:03.656 --> 02:05.056
I can't just sit here!

02:05.125 --> 02:08.118
I am coming to help!

02:08.193 --> 02:10.753
[weezing ]

02:10.830 --> 02:14.426
Oh, hello.
Well, that didn't work out.

02:17.403 --> 02:18.769
BILLY:
They'll live.

02:18.838 --> 02:21.569
Remember, if they die...
You die.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.166
What more do you want?!

02:23.243 --> 02:24.643
I just performed an-
um, guy graft?

02:24.711 --> 02:27.510
Silence!
The room has ears.

02:27.580 --> 02:28.809
They are everywhere.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.316
Listening, plotting!

02:30.383 --> 02:32.375
Laughing at our hair!

02:32.452 --> 02:33.886
BILLY:
Look. I did the surgery thing.

02:33.953 --> 02:35.785
We are even.
Right? Even?

02:35.855 --> 02:37.255
You took my limbs!

02:37.323 --> 02:39.224
You built some crazy machine
that took your limbs!

02:39.292 --> 02:40.817
I just pulled a lever!

02:40.894 --> 02:42.920
And then they took
my limbs that you took!

02:42.996 --> 02:45.795
Like a butterfly painting
his wings in powders!

02:45.865 --> 02:48.164
Whorish and deceptive!

02:48.234 --> 02:49.463
Okaaaay...

02:49.536 --> 02:51.129
I'm gonna just
get back in the bag

02:51.204 --> 02:52.763
and you can knock me out
or whatever.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.432
I just want to wake up
in my own bed again.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.203
Nnnngh.

02:56.276 --> 02:58.836
I feel like moist hell...
Who are you?

02:58.912 --> 03:00.904
My name is Revenge.

03:00.980 --> 03:03.006
Conserve your strength,
Red Mantle.

03:03.082 --> 03:04.846
You'll need it.

03:04.918 --> 03:07.353
Agh! What have you done?!
You idiot!

03:07.420 --> 03:08.945
Your bodies were dying.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.581
I have saved you.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.182
What are you,
Ray Harryhausen?!

03:12.258 --> 03:14.454
I was fine!
He was the dying one.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.826
You should have put his head
on your shoulders!

03:16.896 --> 03:19.491
Yell why don't you.
I'm trying to sleep.

03:19.566 --> 03:22.468
Good lord!
We've been stitched together!

03:22.535 --> 03:24.936
Welcome to alive, Dragoon.

03:25.004 --> 03:26.472
My name is Revenge.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.202
Your name is Phantom Limb,
you fucking lunatic!

03:29.275 --> 03:30.538
That's Phantom Limb?

03:30.610 --> 03:31.543
Ah, no wonder!

03:31.611 --> 03:34.080
He's like number 1 on the
Guild's Most Wanted list.

03:34.147 --> 03:35.615
Great!

03:35.682 --> 03:37.048
He's going to kill us!

03:37.116 --> 03:38.414
[snickers]
Hardly.

03:38.484 --> 03:39.975
I have plans for you.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.783
And after you hear
what I will tell you...

03:41.854 --> 03:44.323
You will willingly help me.

03:44.390 --> 03:45.653
BILLY-BAG:
I can't hear that!

03:45.725 --> 03:48.126
And if I did,
I have a very bad memory.

03:50.830 --> 03:52.662
WATCH/WARD:
Sovereign!

03:52.732 --> 03:55.634
Pay no attention to the handsome
and ageless rock star

03:55.702 --> 03:57.898
hiding behind the couch!

03:57.971 --> 04:00.668
I am the Mighty Sovereign.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.572
Everybody knows who you are,
my master.

04:02.642 --> 04:05.578
Really? You sure?
Everybody?

04:05.645 --> 04:07.079
Pretty much.

04:07.146 --> 04:09.911
And may I say that Hours was
a totally underrated album.

04:09.983 --> 04:11.713
Yeah?
I mean, I thought so.

04:11.784 --> 04:13.412
But wasn't it kinda
too little to late?

04:13.486 --> 04:14.613
That would be Tin Machine.

04:14.687 --> 04:16.986
Master, The Guild has
been penetrated.

04:17.055 --> 04:19.355
Two of your council members
have been taken.

04:19.425 --> 04:20.449
Impossible!

04:20.526 --> 04:21.994
Getting past the diamond dogs?

04:22.060 --> 04:23.154
We would have at least
heard the chants

04:23.229 --> 04:25.198
of the ever circling
Skeletal Family!

04:25.265 --> 04:26.858
The Intruder knew
all of our secrets.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.231
We suspect that--

04:28.301 --> 04:29.894
Phantom Limb has returned!

04:29.969 --> 04:32.234
Aaaand that's kinda
the good news.

04:32.305 --> 04:34.399
The bad news...
You tell him.

04:34.474 --> 04:35.373
No way!

04:35.441 --> 04:36.875
Dude, we already
went through this.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.707
Tell me or you both die.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.873
He penetrated
the Chamber Sub-Rosa.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.541
The Chamber Sub-Rosa!?...

04:43.616 --> 04:45.278
And the Charter?
Is the Charter safe?

04:45.351 --> 04:46.944
Uh...Gone.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.921
You!
Summon the High Council!

04:48.988 --> 04:50.718
And you, Call Iman!

04:50.790 --> 04:52.486
Tell her I'll be on tour!

04:54.494 --> 04:57.020
What are you doing?
I'm trying to read!

04:57.096 --> 04:59.122
I have read this page twice.

04:59.198 --> 05:02.726
I can almost feel our hands,
so I'm trying to turn the page.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.533
You going to make me
bloody my nose, you fool!

05:05.605 --> 05:07.301
Then turn the page!

05:07.373 --> 05:09.308
Well I don't know
what I'm looking for!

05:09.375 --> 05:11.071
Stop feigning ignorance!

05:11.144 --> 05:12.806
You two are the oldest living
members of the Guild.

05:12.879 --> 05:14.745
You know her secrets.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.146
Yes fine.

05:16.215 --> 05:18.241
And your grandfather
started it.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.617
I don't need to read
the charter for this!

05:20.687 --> 05:22.315
You want to know
about your grandfather?

05:22.388 --> 05:23.822
Well why didn't-

05:23.890 --> 05:27.486
Alright, it was
February, 1659...

05:27.560 --> 05:30.052
We were playing
the Winter Dance Party

05:30.129 --> 05:32.530
in the middle
of nowhere Iowa.

05:32.598 --> 05:34.328
We were musicians then--

05:34.400 --> 05:37.336
RED MANTLE:
I was! You just
kinda talk-singed.

05:37.403 --> 05:39.531
DRAGOON:
I was accidentally
creating hip-hop!

05:39.605 --> 05:41.403
Anyway, this old guy
approached us

05:41.474 --> 05:43.170
with an offer
we couldn't refu--

05:43.242 --> 05:44.676
BILLY-BAG:
Wait, wait.
I'm confused.

05:44.744 --> 05:46.804
This happened in
sixteen fifty nine?

05:46.879 --> 05:49.542
DRAGOON:
What? No. Nineteen fifty nine.

05:49.615 --> 05:51.584
You said sixteen fifty nine.

05:51.651 --> 05:52.983
No I didn't.

05:53.052 --> 05:54.315
You totally did!

05:54.387 --> 05:55.787
Right?
Am I crazy?

05:55.855 --> 05:57.653
Whatever.
It doesn't matter.

05:57.724 --> 05:59.784
Ya see, the old guy told us
he was making

05:59.859 --> 06:02.886
a rock and roll orchestra!

06:02.962 --> 06:04.624
And that old man was
The legendary Fantomas!

06:07.133 --> 06:09.500
DRAGOON:
The grandfather
of Captain Crazy here.

06:09.569 --> 06:12.300
PHANTOM LIMB:
My grandfather was himself
a talented musician.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.670
RED MANTLE:
Sousaphone!

06:13.740 --> 06:15.675
Your grandfather played
a sousaphone.

06:15.742 --> 06:16.801
He was awful!

06:16.876 --> 06:18.640
Every day
he'd make us rehearse.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.976
This band made up
of kidnapped musicians

06:21.047 --> 06:24.677
and this old man and
his ridiculous sousaphone.

06:24.751 --> 06:27.118
So Phantom Limb kidnapped you
to start a band?

06:27.186 --> 06:29.178
So he could be like
his grandfather?

06:29.255 --> 06:30.416
No, young William!

06:30.490 --> 06:32.516
The Guild was once much more
than a safe haven

06:32.592 --> 06:35.255
for washed up rock stars!

06:35.328 --> 06:36.728
It was a sacred order
of knights

06:36.796 --> 06:38.355
that were sworn
to protect

06:38.431 --> 06:40.229
an ancient
doomsday device!

06:40.299 --> 06:41.597
The ORB!

06:41.667 --> 06:43.363
I don't remember reading that.

06:43.436 --> 06:44.836
I admit it...
I was skimming.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.066
Okay... Um...
Don't kill me or anything.

06:47.140 --> 06:51.271
But...
I know where the ORB is.

06:51.344 --> 06:53.040
Is he pointing
a gun at me?

06:53.112 --> 06:54.375
- Tell me!
- It's in a safe!

06:54.447 --> 06:56.609
At the Venture compound...

I have a list of

07:02.155 --> 07:03.521
Number one!

07:03.589 --> 07:05.285
This.
Don't do this!

07:05.358 --> 07:07.122
What's number two?

07:07.193 --> 07:08.525

Nothing!
I don't have a number two.

07:08.594 --> 07:09.857
I don't even have a list.

Get out of the bathroom!

07:10.997 --> 07:12.625
Hank hates me!

07:12.698 --> 07:14.860
I- I can't take it.

07:14.934 --> 07:18.098
I have given the boy
nothing but appropriate

07:18.171 --> 07:21.573
and one million
percent legal love,

07:21.641 --> 07:24.805
and he just
hates me.

Your name is Hatred.

07:26.412 --> 07:28.108
You have "HATRED" tattooed
down your chest!

07:28.181 --> 07:29.410
What do you expect?

07:29.482 --> 07:32.350
I also have Calvin and Hobbs
tattooed on my thigh!

07:32.418 --> 07:34.910
And Calvin isn't
taking a wee!

07:34.987 --> 07:37.081
No, he's huggin' Hobbs!

07:37.156 --> 07:39.057
He's killing me
with this crap.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.525
Every week...

07:40.593 --> 07:42.118
That's impossible!

07:42.195 --> 07:44.460
Apparently Rhode Island is
in our driveway.

07:44.530 --> 07:45.657
I gotta deal with this.

07:45.731 --> 07:48.166
Dean, he listens to you.
Get him out of there.

07:48.234 --> 07:49.998
Uncle Hatred?

07:50.069 --> 07:51.037
HATRED:
Dean?

07:51.103 --> 07:53.072
I'm gonna be straight up
and down with you.

07:53.139 --> 07:56.507
Uncle Hatred has
fallen right off the wagon.

07:56.576 --> 07:58.568
I'm drinking-
I don't know-

07:58.644 --> 08:01.239
It's awful-
I think it's Axe cologne.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.545
Or...
maybe the CVS equivalent.

08:03.616 --> 08:05.244
I don't know--

08:05.318 --> 08:06.149
Hatred! You listen to me!

08:06.219 --> 08:08.017
This is your sponsor talking!

08:08.087 --> 08:10.784
What is step number 4?!

08:10.857 --> 08:14.191
To make a fearless moral
inventory of ourselves?

08:14.260 --> 08:16.456
Yes, and what are you doing
in there?

08:16.529 --> 08:19.055
I don't know what
"moral inventory" means!

08:19.131 --> 08:21.532
And you're not my sponsor!

08:21.601 --> 08:23.763
Pretty little boys
do not drink!

08:23.836 --> 08:25.600
You need your shot.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.936
You're going to the dark
place again.

08:28.007 --> 08:28.838
HATRED:
I know!

08:28.908 --> 08:30.809
Dean!
You gotta see this!

08:30.877 --> 08:34.712
The front lawn is crawling with
those bald-headed Guild guys!

08:34.780 --> 08:36.544
WHAT!?

08:36.616 --> 08:39.085
We are in full lockdown!

08:39.150 --> 08:41.985
Into the panic room!

08:42.054 --> 08:44.421
Hank? Buddy?

08:44.490 --> 08:45.856
Wow...
Look at that.

08:45.925 --> 08:47.154
HANK:
Whatever...

08:47.226 --> 08:49.058
I guess I'll go hide
in the panic room...

08:49.128 --> 08:50.391
HATRED:
Hey, uh...

08:50.463 --> 08:53.797
You wanna help your uncle Hatred
stop the bad guys?

08:53.866 --> 08:54.799
DRAGOON:
You! Me!

08:54.867 --> 08:56.597
You! Me!
You! Me!

08:56.669 --> 08:57.864
You! Me! You! Me!

08:57.937 --> 08:59.906
Alright, fine, fine, fine.

08:59.972 --> 09:01.838

17:12.798 --> 17:14.266
BILLY-BAG:
I don't know, I guess.

17:14.333 --> 17:15.425
I can't see anything.

17:15.501 --> 17:17.492
Well then get out of the ba-
Oh dear.

17:17.569 --> 17:19.401
Hands up in the air.

17:19.471 --> 17:20.530
Put your hand up!

17:20.606 --> 17:22.768
Screw that!

17:22.840 --> 17:23.740
What was that?

17:23.809 --> 17:26.472
That's a Guild Blackout.
Dangerous idiots.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.012
They don't even make
minimum wage.

17:28.079 --> 17:30.015
And Chuck is the muscle.

17:30.082 --> 17:32.176
Hilarious.
Here. Hold this.

17:32.251 --> 17:33.742
I just learned how
to make a fist,

17:33.819 --> 17:35.117
and that's like
a bomb.

17:35.187 --> 17:36.177
You carry it.

17:36.255 --> 17:37.985
I'm carrying the Billy-bag!

17:38.057 --> 17:39.081
Then leave him!

17:39.158 --> 17:41.059
But...
Great, we knocked him out.

17:41.126 --> 17:43.186
What is this, an episode of
Gilligan's Island?

17:43.262 --> 17:46.323
Everybody gets hit once then
they are instantly unconscious.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.230
Good one.

17:48.300 --> 17:51.202
Six bucks says he has amnesia
when he wakes up.

17:51.270 --> 17:54.866
PHANTOM LIMB:
Where are you, Shape shifter?!

17:54.940 --> 17:56.806
So sneaky.
You could be anywhere.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.867
Anything.

17:58.944 --> 18:00.344
Yes, Wisdom.

18:00.412 --> 18:01.710
A shape shifter.

18:01.780 --> 18:03.442
You know that...

18:03.515 --> 18:05.416
Well I didn't say you were.

18:05.484 --> 18:07.350
What are you getting at,
Wisdom?

18:07.419 --> 18:09.547
If that is your name...

18:09.621 --> 18:11.783
Or could it be Sovereign!

18:11.857 --> 18:13.883
Every professional nemesis
has weaknesses.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.427
One! They wear goggles.

18:15.494 --> 18:16.757
Peripheral vision is shot.

18:16.829 --> 18:17.819
Two!

18:17.896 --> 18:19.558
Helmets with logos
and stuff on them.

18:19.631 --> 18:21.395
A guy with a big metal piece
of punctuation on his hat

18:21.467 --> 18:22.992
can't turn his head fast.

18:23.068 --> 18:25.094
So you gotta be moving.
Always moving!

18:25.170 --> 18:26.968
Got it!
Always moving.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.598
I'm you from the the future!

18:28.674 --> 18:30.233
We have to finish
our time machine

18:30.309 --> 18:33.404
before the the Angels of
Destruction find the portal!

18:33.479 --> 18:35.209
Naaa, I'm just
messing with you.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.146
Come with me.
I need your help.

18:37.216 --> 18:39.048
Guild has been standing
out there all night

18:39.118 --> 18:40.552
just waiting for me.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.110
Guaranteed...
this is a trap.

18:42.187 --> 18:44.418
Hmm...probably a bag
of scorpions

18:44.490 --> 18:47.756
that have been trained to take
the shape of a guy!

18:47.826 --> 18:49.988
- Hank, that's mental.
- Watch out!

18:50.062 --> 18:51.997
The scorpions coulda been
trained to shoot

18:52.064 --> 18:53.623
little cocktail rifles!

18:53.699 --> 18:56.225
It's a trap!

18:56.301 --> 18:58.532
It's a sleeping boy.

18:58.604 --> 19:02.097
He's all cozy in his
sweet little PJs.

19:02.174 --> 19:03.938
They're preying
on my weakness!

19:04.009 --> 19:06.171
Those monsters!

19:06.245 --> 19:08.714
Hey! I found
the stack of Playboys!

19:15.354 --> 19:17.380
Look what he did to us.

19:17.456 --> 19:19.925
I heard. But you guys are
kinda working it.

19:19.992 --> 19:20.857
Looks good.

19:20.926 --> 19:22.417
Really?
Thank you.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.690
Hey, we're sorry for probably
killing everyone.

19:24.763 --> 19:27.062
He wants us to read this.

19:27.132 --> 19:28.794
[ clears throat ]

19:28.867 --> 19:31.962
"Make way for
the dashing Phantom Limb!"

19:32.037 --> 19:34.006
I didn't write this crap.

19:34.072 --> 19:36.632
"Grandson of FantOmas!

19:36.708 --> 19:39.507
Victor at the battle
of Cremation Creek

19:39.578 --> 19:41.012
and Keeper of the Orb!

19:41.079 --> 19:42.206
And the rightful Sovereign

19:42.281 --> 19:46.013
of the Guild
of Calamitous Intent

19:51.089 --> 19:53.388
Well done, Lady Nightshade!

19:53.458 --> 19:55.051
Was that a shoe?

19:55.127 --> 19:58.461
Sweetie!
Have you seen my other shoe?

19:58.530 --> 20:00.726
The black Ferragamo?

20:00.799 --> 20:04.395
By birthright,
I am your sovereign!

20:07.739 --> 20:08.707
Wisdom!

20:08.774 --> 20:10.106
I should have trusted you.

20:10.175 --> 20:11.905
I will avenge your death.

20:11.977 --> 20:14.845
If it's not
the Thin White Douche!

20:14.913 --> 20:17.280
Hand the Guild over
to its rightful heir!

20:17.349 --> 20:19.341
Or I will activate this!

20:19.418 --> 20:21.683
Please, no. Don't activate
a broken coffee mug.

20:21.753 --> 20:23.722
Behold!

20:23.789 --> 20:25.553
The Orb!

20:25.624 --> 20:28.025
Yes, well, in that case,
I'll hand the Guild over.

20:28.093 --> 20:31.257
Meet the rightful heir to the
Guild of Calamitous Intent...

20:31.330 --> 20:33.094
Dean Venture!

20:33.165 --> 20:35.157
Lloyd Venture,
that boy's great grandfather,

20:35.234 --> 20:37.135
was the Grand Protector
of the Orb.

20:37.202 --> 20:40.695
Your Grandfather, not unlike
you, was a usurper!

20:40.772 --> 20:43.105
All hail the Sovereign!

20:43.175 --> 20:44.905
[ cheering ]

20:44.977 --> 20:47.674
I am the Sovereign!

20:47.746 --> 20:49.271
Alright boy, hustle this up.

20:49.348 --> 20:50.407
I want these idiots
out of here.

20:50.482 --> 20:51.313
They're killing my lawn.

20:51.383 --> 20:52.681
Oh, sorry.

20:52.751 --> 20:54.185
In the name of Chaos!

20:54.253 --> 20:55.243
Dominion!

20:55.320 --> 20:56.982
And organized havoc!

20:57.055 --> 20:59.615
I dub thee Sovereign,

20:59.691 --> 21:02.286
lord of the Guild
of Calamitous Intent!

21:02.361 --> 21:04.227
Good on ya, boy.

21:04.296 --> 21:05.491
He's a Venture.

21:05.564 --> 21:07.260
This is crap!
I'm the rightful heir!

21:07.332 --> 21:09.130
Me! Phantom Limb!

21:09.201 --> 21:12.228
And I shall go down in history
as her destroyer!

21:12.304 --> 21:14.034
Behold!

21:14.106 --> 21:19.875
The awesome power of the Orb!

21:20.879 --> 21:22.780
Please don't activate it.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.214
Sandow...

21:24.283 --> 21:25.342
I must.

21:25.417 --> 21:28.512
Then so must Sandow.

21:30.989 --> 21:32.287
You broke it!

21:32.357 --> 21:33.985
You destroyed the Orb!

21:34.059 --> 21:35.721
My orders were to kill you.

21:35.794 --> 21:37.387
Oh.
Well in that case...

21:37.462 --> 21:38.896
Thanks?

21:38.964 --> 21:41.627
And let's not tell anybody
about this, shall we?

21:41.700 --> 21:43.999
No! No!

21:44.069 --> 21:45.537
It doesn't work!

21:45.604 --> 21:48.130
Seize the traitor!

21:50.842 --> 21:52.834
Two heads are better
than one!

21:52.911 --> 21:53.844
What does that have to do
with anything?

21:53.912 --> 21:55.175
Nothing...

21:55.247 --> 21:56.681
I've just been wanting
to say that all day.

21:56.748 --> 21:59.047
I got sick of waiting
for an opportunity.

22:27.913 --> 22:29.006
[startles from sleep]

22:29.081 --> 22:30.049
That was crazy...

22:30.115 --> 22:32.175
White!
White, you up?!

22:32.250 --> 22:34.310
You gotta hear
about this dream I had!

22:34.386 --> 22:35.354
It was completely nu-

22:35.420 --> 22:37.412
Good morning, sunshine!

22:37.489 --> 22:40.653
I wanna go back in my bag!
