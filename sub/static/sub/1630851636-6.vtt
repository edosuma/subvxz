Did you deliver a child

04:24.924 --> 04:27.013

the night before the verdict,

05:18.021 --> 05:21.894
to see what he was up to,
from afar.

05:21.938 --> 05:24.027
And that is a standard
trial science tactic.

Maybe your team will
tell me that, maybe not.

Case like this breeds
a lot of stress.

under that projected confidence?

05:43.133 --> 05:45.353
Not even a little.Really?

The only thing you're facing
is the loss of your career,

05:48.791 --> 05:51.271
your reputation, your freedom.

05:51.315 --> 05:53.491
That's why I hired the best.

05:55.885 --> 05:58.104
Then why are you standing there
taking up my time

05:58.148 --> 06:00.106
instead of letting me do my job?

06:00.150 --> 06:01.804
Because I can be of help.

Don't give me that.

Don't think I won't do it again.

Are you threatening

06:52.985 --> 06:54.465
to chain yourself to our lobby?

06:54.509 --> 06:57.076
Sure, if it'll get me

06:57.120 --> 06:58.556

07:05.302 --> 07:07.957
and practicing medicine without
a license in Tioga County.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.090
They want to lock me away
for delivering babies.

07:11.134 --> 07:13.876
Tioga County? It's a little
out of our jurisdiction.

07:13.919 --> 07:16.095
The D.A. asked
for a change of venue,

07:16.139 --> 07:17.880
got the trial moved
to Manhattan.

07:17.923 --> 07:21.492
Probably thought you'd get a
sympathetic jury at home. Smart.

07:21.536 --> 07:23.146
Yeah, my first lawyer said that.

07:23.189 --> 07:25.757
Told me we'd lose in New York
City, I should take a deal.

07:25.801 --> 07:27.759
So I fired the weasel.

That's when
I found your name.

Her trial starts on Monday,
and as I've been

07:31.981 --> 07:35.375
trying to explain,
we have a very full weekend.

07:35.419 --> 07:38.291
We do, but I can spare
five minutes.

40 years.

07:49.868 --> 07:51.348
how can they charge you
with fraud?

07:51.391 --> 07:52.523
I was licensed

07:54.046 --> 07:56.745
where my late husband and I
used to live.

07:56.788 --> 07:59.530
Plus, 34 other states.

07:59.574 --> 08:01.227
Not New York.

08:01.271 --> 08:03.273
Why not get licensed
in New York?

08:03.316 --> 08:05.318
State requires
a master's degree,

08:05.362 --> 08:09.453
and the-the closest program is
three hours from where I live.

08:09.497 --> 08:12.587
Not to mention
they want 30,000 bucks.

08:12.630 --> 08:15.546
[scoffs] Do I look like
I have 30,000 bucks?

08:15.590 --> 08:17.592
Why not practice
where you're legal?

08:17.635 --> 08:20.246
What... What keeps you
in Tioga County?

08:20.290 --> 08:23.293
I work with
Old Order Mennonites.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.905
That particular community
is especially traditional.

08:26.949 --> 08:29.125
They don't see regular doctors,

08:29.168 --> 08:31.823
let alone step inside
a hospital for an ultrasound.

08:31.867 --> 08:34.652
I've spent years
building trust

08:34.696 --> 08:36.088
in that community.

08:36.132 --> 08:38.134
Without me, their pregnant women

08:38.177 --> 08:40.789
won't get any medical care
at all.

08:40.832 --> 08:42.791
It's a disaster.

08:42.834 --> 08:45.141
Our sheriff...

08:45.184 --> 08:47.752
...used to look the other way.

08:47.796 --> 08:50.712
He understood
that I'm all they've got.

08:50.755 --> 08:52.801
And then this new D.A.
gets the job.

08:52.844 --> 08:55.151
She's a real little...

08:56.195 --> 08:57.327
...stickler.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.242
Mm.I know three law firms

08:59.285 --> 09:01.592
that would be really
well-suited to help you in...No.

09:01.636 --> 09:04.116
I need you. You're the jury guy.

09:04.160 --> 09:07.206
A New York City jury
is not gonna get what I do.

09:07.250 --> 09:11.210
I wish I could help you, Maggie,
but like my colleague told you,

09:11.254 --> 09:13.648
I am stretched very thin
right now. I...Look,

09:13.691 --> 09:16.259
if this is about money...

09:17.303 --> 09:19.741
...I've got 200

so apparently, yes.

19:16.380 --> 19:17.990
You won't get anyone
without my help.

19:18.034 --> 19:20.079
Well, we'll see about that.

19:20.123 --> 19:22.125
But you are staying here
with me,

19:22.169 --> 19:24.258
and I am gonna teach you
how to testify.

19:28.175 --> 19:29.872
[exhales]

19:29.915 --> 19:31.047
We good?

19:31.090 --> 19:32.266
I'm here.

19:32.309 --> 19:35.704
All right. Let's get to work.

19:35.747 --> 19:37.532
Why is it hard for a Mennonite

19:37.575 --> 19:40.622
who needs health care
in Tioga County?

19:40.665 --> 19:42.624
Well, it's rural.

19:42.667 --> 19:47.455
The closest hospital is usually
at least an hour away by car.

19:47.498 --> 19:50.109
But the majority of Mennonites
don't use cars

19:50.153 --> 19:52.721
and they're strongly resistant
to modern medicine

19:52.764 --> 19:54.766
and most of its technology.

19:54.810 --> 19:58.901
Then how can a Mennonite woman
get help delivering her baby?

19:58.944 --> 20:02.644
Well, the old practice of
the doctor who makes house calls

20:02.687 --> 20:07.388
and knows everybody's name
would work, but that's gone.

20:07.431 --> 20:09.564
So instead, you go. Correct?

20:09.607 --> 20:12.393
Yes. I have been visiting
patients in that community

20:12.436 --> 20:14.221
for seven years.

20:14.264 --> 20:16.266
BULL:
But you are not licensed

20:16.310 --> 20:18.268
in this state, so why
would you risk your freedom

20:18.312 --> 20:20.270
to help these Mennonite women?

20:20.314 --> 20:24.405
These women are facing the most
profound moment of their lives,

20:24.448 --> 20:29.453
moments of joy
or heartbreaking tragedy.

20:29.497 --> 20:32.413
The difference between
one outcome and the other

20:32.456 --> 20:35.764
is having a medical professional
at their side.

20:35.807 --> 20:40.334
Knowing that, how could I
turn my back on them?

20:43.902 --> 20:46.165
Good.

20:46.209 --> 20:49.647
The jury is connecting with you.
That's what we want.

20:49.691 --> 20:51.606
Now, Chester Palmer's
gonna come up here

20:51.649 --> 20:54.261
and he's gonna give you
a very hard time.

20:54.304 --> 20:56.001
Do not let him trigger you.

20:56.045 --> 20:57.133
CHUNK:
How many children have died

20:57.176 --> 20:59.091
during birth under
your supervision?

20:59.135 --> 21:02.051
Stillbirths
are a fact of nature.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.226
They have nothing to do...

21:03.270 --> 21:04.880
How many dead infants?

21:06.664 --> 21:08.449
Not many.

21:08.492 --> 21:10.494
But too many.

21:10.538 --> 21:13.105
Did you know that the infant
mortality rate is higher

21:13.149 --> 21:14.455
for home births
under midwives

21:14.498 --> 21:16.152
than it is in
American hospitals?

21:16.195 --> 21:17.632
Not true.

21:17.675 --> 21:19.938
Are you disputing
the findings

21:19.982 --> 21:21.592
of the American
Medical Association?

21:21.636 --> 21:22.767
No.

21:22.811 --> 21:24.595
It's misleading, what you're...

21:24.639 --> 21:27.555
Yes or no, Mrs. Haldane?

21:29.121 --> 21:30.949
Stay cool.

21:30.993 --> 21:34.823
CHUNK:Are you aware of the higher risk
for deaths under home births?

21:34.866 --> 21:37.608
Are you aware that maternal
death rates after birth

21:37.652 --> 21:39.567
are higher in hospitals
than at home?

21:39.610 --> 21:40.916
That's not what I asked.

21:40.959 --> 21:42.613
But no one blames obstetricians.

21:42.657 --> 21:44.876
CHUNK:Knowing how risky
home births can be,

21:44.920 --> 21:46.835
why did you refuse to comply

21:46.878 --> 21:49.011
with the state-sanctioned
requirements

21:49.054 --> 21:51.056
meant to ensure
safety standards?

21:51.100 --> 21:52.841
They have nothing to do
with safety

21:52.884 --> 21:55.147
and everything to do
with greedy hospitals

21:55.191 --> 21:57.672
who want the money that
all these home births cost them.

21:57.715 --> 21:59.108
You have no
evidence of that,

21:59.151 --> 22:00.457
do you?I have eyes.

22:00.501 --> 22:02.851
I can see.

22:02.894 --> 22:05.070
The hospital-industrial
complex

22:05.114 --> 22:06.637
put pressure on the D.A.

22:06.681 --> 22:09.248
to lock up a little old lady
who catches babies

22:09.292 --> 22:11.250
all so they could
make a buck.

22:11.294 --> 22:13.514
They're a bunch
of money-grubbing bastards.

22:15.777 --> 22:18.127
MARISSA:
I mean, the jurors
just don't like her.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.130
They don't think that Maggie
is nurturing and professional.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.784
They find her defensive
and volatile.

22:22.827 --> 22:25.177
Even you can't change
someone's entire personality

22:25.221 --> 22:26.831
in 36 hours.Yeah.

22:26.875 --> 22:29.399
Well, she might get a little
better, but she's never gonna

22:29.443 --> 22:32.663
convince a jury to acquit,
not by herself.

22:32.707 --> 22:35.274
We need a character witness.
How's Taylor coming with that?

22:35.318 --> 22:37.668
It's a bust. She left messages,
but nobody's called back.

22:37.712 --> 22:40.323
She even managed to find
a community landline,

22:40.367 --> 22:42.064
but no one's
answering.

22:42.107 --> 22:44.153
Well, given how they feel about
strangers, I'm not surprised.

22:44.196 --> 22:47.243
Hmm. She was right.

22:47.286 --> 22:50.681
We need Maggie
to bring someone in.

22:51.856 --> 22:54.337
You seem nervous, Ms. Rentzel.

22:54.381 --> 22:55.817
TAYLOR:
Staring down the barrel

22:55.860 --> 22:57.732
of going to prison
will do that to a girl.

22:57.775 --> 23:00.561
So you think you did
something illegal?

23:00.604 --> 23:03.346
No, absolutely not. It's just...

23:03.390 --> 23:05.827
any time the teacher says
someone cheated on a test,

23:05.870 --> 23:08.264
you think it might be you,
even though you know you didn't.

23:08.307 --> 23:09.483
[laughs softly]

23:09.526 --> 23:12.181
Okay. So, at Dr. Bull's
direction,

23:12.224 --> 23:15.576
you investigated the finances
of Randall Hughes,

23:15.619 --> 23:18.796
the juror who alleges
Dr. Bull bribed him.

23:18.840 --> 23:22.583
Um, yes, but...

23:22.626 --> 23:25.063
evaluating jurors' finances
is typical

23:25.107 --> 23:26.978
for a trial
science company.

23:27.022 --> 23:28.589
Statistically,
people who owe money

23:28.632 --> 23:31.113
often grant
bigger settlement payouts.

23:31.156 --> 23:33.202
And what did Dr. Bull learn

23:33.245 --> 23:35.160
about Hughes's
financial situation?

23:35.204 --> 23:39.513
Hughes had pretty substantial
medical debt.

23:39.556 --> 23:41.210
He had to refinance his house.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.255
So you see the problem for us?

23:44.256 --> 23:45.606
Nothing I did was wrong.

23:45.649 --> 23:47.303
All my research was legal.

23:47.346 --> 23:49.044
But the prosecution
will say

23:49.087 --> 23:51.220
you drew Dr. Bull a map

23:51.263 --> 23:54.092
to the juror most susceptible
to bribery.

23:54.136 --> 23:56.094
That wasn't what I was doing.

23:58.662 --> 24:01.448
Dr. Bull says he went
to Randall Hughes's house

24:01.491 --> 24:03.493
the night
before jury deliberations

24:03.537 --> 24:05.626
to rummage through the trash.

24:05.669 --> 24:08.629
Has he ever done that before?

24:09.760 --> 24:12.633
I don't remember.

24:12.676 --> 24:14.896
I mean, we've had
a lot of cases.

24:16.854 --> 24:19.509
Do you doubt Dr. Bull's
innocence, Ms. Rentzel?

24:21.511 --> 24:23.470
No, I don't.

24:23.513 --> 24:25.297
I was told that you do.

24:26.342 --> 24:28.344
Doubts about lines
being crossed.

24:28.387 --> 24:32.217
About "good people
doing the wrong things

24:32.261 --> 24:33.480
for the right reasons."

24:35.133 --> 24:37.701
You said that, yes?

24:37.745 --> 24:40.617
Yes.So let's revisit
my questions

24:40.661 --> 24:43.315
about Dr. Bull's dumpster dive.

24:43.359 --> 24:46.884
And from here on in,
I want the truth.

24:49.060 --> 24:51.367
Why did you tell that woman
what I said about Bull?

24:51.410 --> 24:53.282
Uh, Taylor...Why would you do that?

24:53.325 --> 24:54.762
BULL:
Hey. You guys.

24:54.805 --> 24:55.980
I need the two of you

24:56.024 --> 24:57.199
to go with Maggie upstate.

24:57.242 --> 24:59.418
Upstate? Why?

25:05.773 --> 25:07.252
[horse neighing]

25:07.296 --> 25:09.907
If anyone is gonna consider
making a trek

25:09.951 --> 25:14.172
to Manhattan for a trial,
it's Sybil and Niels Knudsen.

25:14.216 --> 25:16.000
I delivered
their last three kids.

25:16.044 --> 25:17.698
They have a car. Good sign.

25:17.741 --> 25:20.439
Sounds good. Let's go see
what they have to say.

25:20.483 --> 25:22.441
Uh, let me talk to them first.

25:22.485 --> 25:26.533
Meantime, uh, you two are gonna
need to make some adjustments.

25:26.576 --> 25:28.796
Mennonites prefer modest dress.

25:28.839 --> 25:31.320
Button up your top button,
roll down your sleeves.

25:32.582 --> 25:34.105
Listen, you're
strangers,

25:34.149 --> 25:37.065
so their antenna is already
gonna be sky-high.

25:37.108 --> 25:38.501
Your point?

25:38.545 --> 25:40.590
The tension between you two
in the car

25:40.634 --> 25:43.637
was so thick you needed
a Weedwacker to cut through it.

25:43.680 --> 25:45.639
Whatever's
going on,

25:45.682 --> 25:48.685
end it, or at least
hide it better.

25:53.821 --> 25:56.650
How dare you tell Olivia
I had doubts about Bull.

25:56.693 --> 25:58.869
You do have doubts.
You told me.

25:58.913 --> 26:01.611
That's right. I told
you and no one else.

26:01.655 --> 26:03.787
We're supposed to be
transparent with Olivia.

26:03.831 --> 26:06.355
You can be as transparent
as you want about yourself.

26:06.398 --> 26:07.965
Leave me out of it.

26:08.009 --> 26:11.708
She pressed me.
I didn't exactly have a choice.

26:11.752 --> 26:13.362
TAYLOR:Now she thinks
I'm a liar.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.059
And she squeezed out
a bunch of things about Bull

26:15.103 --> 26:16.234
I didn't want her to know.

26:16.278 --> 26:17.409
All because you had
to run your mouth.

26:17.453 --> 26:19.629
I think you're overreacting.

26:19.673 --> 26:21.022
TAYLOR:
I thought I could trust you.

26:21.065 --> 26:23.415
I thought you of all people
would have my back.

26:23.459 --> 26:25.200
[door closes]

26:27.376 --> 26:29.030
Big surprise.

26:29.073 --> 26:31.772
The Knudsens don't want to have
anything to do with you.

26:31.815 --> 26:33.469
Why not?

26:33.512 --> 26:35.906
What part of
"Mennonites don't like conflict"

26:35.950 --> 26:37.604
did you not understand?

26:42.913 --> 26:44.872
[knocks on door]

26:44.915 --> 26:46.874
Burning the midnight oil?

26:46.917 --> 26:49.528
[door closes]

26:49.572 --> 26:50.834
Jason Bull.

26:50.878 --> 26:54.795
That special snowflake
who thinks,

26:54.838 --> 26:57.232
of all the criminal
defendants in the world,

26:57.275 --> 27:00.844
he can't possibly
be sent to jail.

27:00.888 --> 27:03.934
I'm guessing the day
didn't go well.

27:03.978 --> 27:06.284
Taylor will testify

27:06.328 --> 27:08.852
that, before Randall
Hughes, you'd never

27:08.896 --> 27:10.462
staked out a juror's home,

27:10.506 --> 27:12.551
never foraged
through the garbage.

27:12.595 --> 27:14.728
Moreover, you didn't tell anyone

27:14.771 --> 27:17.600
about the Hughes visit
until after the arrest.

27:17.644 --> 27:19.515
Others will
corroborate.

27:22.213 --> 27:24.215
I needed to think.

27:24.259 --> 27:26.261
Take the measure of the man.Great.

27:26.304 --> 27:30.265
So all I have to do is explain
your perfectly innocent,

27:30.308 --> 27:35.662
secret, unprecedented trip
to dig through a juror's trash.

27:36.750 --> 27:38.665
You say it like it's a problem.

27:38.708 --> 27:40.710
[laughs softly]

27:42.799 --> 27:45.846
This Mr. Glib routine...

27:45.889 --> 27:48.065
I don't think
it's fooling you,

27:48.109 --> 27:50.720
and it sure as hell
ain't fooling me.

27:50.764 --> 27:55.072
I never denied I was there
or the reasons why.

27:55.116 --> 27:57.074
All we have to do
is explain them.

27:57.118 --> 27:58.728
When you're
explaining,

27:58.772 --> 28:00.469
you're losing.

28:00.512 --> 28:04.125
And right now, you're losing.

28:06.780 --> 28:10.000
I got to hand it to her, the
woman knows how to stir the pot.

28:10.044 --> 28:12.873
Taylor is so mad at me
I've taken refuge in the car.

28:12.916 --> 28:15.397
Wow. Well, maybe
Olivia is stirring up

28:15.440 --> 28:17.138
more than she bargained for.

28:17.181 --> 28:19.140
Well, what's she got you
wrestling with?

28:19.183 --> 28:21.185
Smokestack was
supposed to be the case

28:21.229 --> 28:23.840
that made my name in this town.

28:23.884 --> 28:25.581
And Olivia said it. She's right.

28:25.624 --> 28:28.192
Having your name attached
to a jury tampering charge

28:28.236 --> 28:30.934
is not an auspicious way
to begin a law career.

28:32.631 --> 28:36.287
[sighs] Am I crazy for not
considering a plan B?

28:36.331 --> 28:38.115
Maybe.

28:40.074 --> 28:42.163
I've been offered a job.

28:42.206 --> 28:45.340
Whoa. I didn't see that coming.

28:45.383 --> 28:46.907
W-With who? What?

28:46.950 --> 28:48.778
Remember when I pitched
the idea of licensing

28:48.822 --> 28:51.738
my algorithm and biotech
to some outside firms?

28:51.781 --> 28:54.175
To help shore up TAC's finances?

28:54.218 --> 28:55.785
Yeah, and Bull shut it down.

28:55.829 --> 28:57.656
It's hard to forget.MARISSA: Well...

28:57.700 --> 28:59.354
one of the firms circled back

28:59.397 --> 29:02.879
and asked me if I would work
for them in-house.

29:04.141 --> 29:05.621
And what did you say?

29:05.664 --> 29:08.755
"Need to think about it."

29:08.798 --> 29:10.800
That's what I'm doing, Chunk.

29:10.844 --> 29:12.802
In the middle
of all this mayhem,

29:12.846 --> 29:15.544
I am considering a plan B.

29:23.857 --> 29:26.076
[moans]
Ah, good morning.

29:26.120 --> 29:27.295
Short stack?

29:27.338 --> 29:28.165
Somebody said they'd be
working all weekend.

29:29.210 --> 29:32.561
To what do I owe this surprise?

29:32.604 --> 29:37.087
My client, she's technically
guilty but spiritually innocent.

29:37.131 --> 29:38.567
Marissa and Taylor...

29:38.610 --> 29:42.353
[groans] ...are up trying

I make pancakes.

29:44.791 --> 29:45.966
Lots of pancakes.

with my husband?

29:47.576 --> 29:49.708
[laughs softly]

29:49.752 --> 29:51.101
What's this?

29:52.624 --> 29:54.409
Oh, just some, uh...

29:54.452 --> 29:56.498

for your money manager.

30:06.595 --> 30:08.292

30:08.336 --> 30:10.033
Well, I figured it was time
to put some of that stuff

30:10.077 --> 30:11.208
down on paper.

30:11.252 --> 30:12.731
Why?

30:12.775 --> 30:14.211
In case.

30:14.255 --> 30:16.257
In case of what?

30:16.300 --> 30:18.172
In case...

30:18.215 --> 30:21.131
my case, it's not going so well.

30:22.785 --> 30:24.831
How not so well?

30:25.875 --> 30:27.616
Well, bad enough where I thought

30:27.659 --> 30:30.140
I ought to get
my affairs in order.

30:33.665 --> 30:34.841
I see.

30:36.843 --> 30:39.497
Uh, okay.

30:42.587 --> 30:45.068
Okay, uh-- Okay, hey.

30:45.112 --> 30:47.070
Well, it's never bad
to be prepared.

30:47.114 --> 30:49.420
That's what I thought.

30:49.464 --> 30:50.900
It's just...
[laughs softly]

30:50.944 --> 30:52.815
I mean, some of these passwords.
Baby, come on.

30:52.859 --> 30:55.557
I-I mean, for a smart guy,
I mean, you really

30:55.600 --> 30:58.168
[laughs]:
are bad at digital security.

30:58.212 --> 31:00.170
You got the plumber's number
in here?

31:00.214 --> 31:01.998
Well...Do you really think I don't know
how to find a plumber?

31:02.042 --> 31:05.132
You could pretend that you are
gonna miss me just a little.

31:05.175 --> 31:08.309
Mm. Can't lie.

31:08.352 --> 31:11.094
I could really use
the closet space.

MARISSA:
Thank you for your time.

31:20.887 --> 31:22.671
I've gotten plenty of
prayers and love for Maggie,

31:22.714 --> 31:24.368
but no one's
willing to testify.

31:24.412 --> 31:27.589
[sighs] Last couple I talked to
was actually considering it,

31:27.632 --> 31:30.766
but between running a farm
and raising eight children,

31:30.809 --> 31:33.116
it's just not possible
to get away.

31:34.335 --> 31:35.510
[sighs]

31:37.033 --> 31:39.383
My mother used to tell me
it's okay to get mad,

31:39.427 --> 31:40.950
not to stay mad.

31:40.994 --> 31:42.604
So now you're calling me
a child?

31:42.647 --> 31:44.954
I am saying the last thing
I would ever want to do

31:44.998 --> 31:46.956
is betray your trust.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.566
I have Mauricio.

31:48.610 --> 31:50.699
The idea that I could
even be in the vicinity

31:50.742 --> 31:52.527
of an obstruction charge is...I know,

31:52.570 --> 31:55.356
but Olivia pressed me,
and I convinced myself

31:55.399 --> 31:57.314
that the more I talked,
the more...

31:57.358 --> 31:59.360
Okay. I'll be right there....it would be helpful
for Bull's case.

31:59.403 --> 32:01.014
I was just trying
to protect him. Like always.

32:01.057 --> 32:03.059
Come on, I got to see a patient.

32:03.103 --> 32:04.582
No.

I was asking?

♪

32:18.988 --> 32:21.425
This is great. First,
we fail to find a witness,

When I was pregnant,
my blood pressure was so high,

Maggie's figuring it out

in a living room.

32:51.847 --> 32:54.023

32:54.067 --> 32:56.286
Here's my problem:

32:56.330 --> 32:59.115
in my heart,
I absolutely believe

32:59.159 --> 33:00.943
Bull did not bribe that juror.

33:00.987 --> 33:02.858
[whispering]:
Me, too.But I have doubts,

33:02.901 --> 33:07.471
because I just can't make sense
of what he did that night.

33:07.515 --> 33:09.996
Because it doesn't make sense.

33:10.039 --> 33:11.780
And that scares me.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.174
Me, too.

33:16.828 --> 33:20.615
There is a laptop on that table
there, next to the telephone.

33:20.658 --> 33:22.704
Guess they don't reject
all technology.

33:23.748 --> 33:25.881
You thinking what I'm thinking?

33:27.100 --> 33:28.405
Neleah is negative

33:28.449 --> 33:29.711
for preeclampsia.

33:29.754 --> 33:31.582
The baby's okay,

33:31.626 --> 33:33.280

as the aspirin kicks in,

33:33.323 --> 33:35.021
she's gonna be fit as a fiddle.

Great, because there's
something we want to ask her.

33:38.111 --> 33:40.330
They have any luck up there?

33:40.374 --> 33:43.420
Okay, I'll see you then. Yep.

33:43.464 --> 33:46.423
They are on their way back
with a pregnant witness.

33:46.467 --> 33:48.034
She is 25,

33:48.077 --> 33:50.079
and Maggie delivered
their first baby.

33:50.123 --> 33:52.908
Nice.There's a problem.

33:52.951 --> 33:55.041
Her husband
died recently,

33:55.084 --> 33:57.043
and she's living
under her father's roof,

33:57.086 --> 33:59.480
who strictly forbids her from
talking about intimate matters

33:59.523 --> 34:01.351
in front of any men.

34:01.395 --> 34:03.571
Like pregnancy and childbirth?

34:03.614 --> 34:05.181
Yeah, I think that qualifies.

34:05.225 --> 34:08.271
So no males can be present
during her testimony.

34:08.315 --> 34:12.319
Well, even if I clear the entire
courtroom of all spectators...

34:12.362 --> 34:14.582
Easy....I got a female lawyer
to do all of the questioning...

34:14.625 --> 34:15.974
Done.

34:16.018 --> 34:17.846
...there's no way
that I can work voir dire

34:17.889 --> 34:20.066
to seat an all-female jury.

34:21.328 --> 34:25.288
Actually, I think
there's a way we can.

34:29.684 --> 34:32.339
My son Noah wasn't due
for five more weeks,

34:32.382 --> 34:34.080
but, um, he had other plans.

34:36.343 --> 34:39.737
My husband Silas,
God rest his soul,

34:39.781 --> 34:43.089
reached out to Maggie, not
expecting her to come, mind you,

34:43.132 --> 34:45.874
just to let her know
my water had broken.

34:45.917 --> 34:49.399
At that time, when did you
expect Maggie to arrive?

34:49.443 --> 34:51.793
We didn't expect her at all.

34:51.836 --> 34:53.577
At least, not until
after the blizzard passed.

34:53.621 --> 34:55.101
It was impossible.

buckets of snow.

So you thought
you were on your own?

35:01.194 --> 35:03.109
But Maggie set off.

35:03.152 --> 35:04.806
Her truck got stuck
on the fire road

35:04.849 --> 35:06.808
and she had to trek in snowshoes
the rest of the way,

35:06.851 --> 35:09.419
which was a godsend,
considering...

35:09.463 --> 35:11.378
Considering what?

35:11.421 --> 35:13.554
All the things that went wrong.

35:13.597 --> 35:18.124
And at any time,
did you or your late husband

35:18.167 --> 35:20.300
consider calling 911?

35:20.343 --> 35:22.650
Even if we had chosen
to give birth in a hospital,

35:22.693 --> 35:25.087
there's no way an ambulance
could've made it in time.

35:25.131 --> 35:27.655
MARISSA [over video]:
So then, what happened?

35:27.698 --> 35:30.223
The birth was difficult.

35:30.266 --> 35:32.877
Baby was kind of breech,
you know,

35:32.921 --> 35:35.402
so it-it took some doing
to get him out.

35:35.445 --> 35:38.622
And then,
the umbilical cord

35:38.666 --> 35:41.364
was wrapped around his neck.

35:42.931 --> 35:45.151
Take as much time as you need.[sniffles]

35:49.633 --> 35:52.941

35:52.984 --> 35:55.335
and his tiny mouth opened
and no sound came out,

35:55.378 --> 35:58.947
just... this terrible silence.

36:00.905 --> 36:02.994
And Maggie's hands
took hold, she...

36:03.038 --> 36:04.300
she unknotted the cord

36:04.344 --> 36:06.346
and-and cleared
his airway and...

36:06.389 --> 36:09.523
and I heard my baby cry.

It was the most beautiful sound
in the world.

One last question.

Do you believe
that Maggie Haldane

saved your son's life
that night?

36:22.405 --> 36:26.366

were God's instruments.

36:26.409 --> 36:29.760
With him working through her,

36:29.804 --> 36:32.328
she did save my son's life.

Thank you.

36:51.129 --> 36:52.653
You were right.

speck of dirt she could find,

defend me or not, I think...

...I think I just had
to have something to do.

37:06.144 --> 37:07.798
I know.

37:09.365 --> 37:12.629
Olivia asked me
if I was quitting.

37:12.673 --> 37:14.022
She did?

As good as.And?

37:18.374 --> 37:20.463
it'll no doubt
leave a stain on me.

to bail

probation.

No prison time.

That's a win.

38:06.379 --> 38:07.684
No.

It's not,

38:10.383 --> 38:11.645
Those women need me.

38:11.688 --> 38:16.040
Yes, Maggie, they need someone

38:16.084 --> 38:21.176
to help find
state-licensed midwives.

38:21.219 --> 38:23.221
You can take all that passion

38:23.265 --> 38:25.876
and grit that you have
and use it

38:25.920 --> 38:28.314
to help train these midwives
to respect the culture

38:28.357 --> 38:29.793
the way you do.

38:29.837 --> 38:33.797
And be the leader
you clearly are.

Yes, you're not riding
to the rescue anymore.

being the hero.

38:51.685 --> 38:55.341
Sounds like you're speaking
from personal experience.

38:57.081 --> 39:00.868
Well, I did learn something
relatively recently.

39:00.911 --> 39:04.654
You do a lot more good
as the leader of a pack

39:04.698 --> 39:06.439
than you do as a lone wolf.

to your guilt.

to all of them--

have doubts...

I'm sorry. Continue.

40:50.760 --> 40:52.719
But not bribery.

No one thinks you'd be satisfied
with a win like that.

40:57.550 --> 41:00.030
For the record,
I agree with them.

41:02.642 --> 41:04.774
So what does that mean?

41:04.818 --> 41:08.604
It means, my friend,
that you are screwed.

You're an innocent man
with not much case to make.

Luckily for you,
that really pisses me off.

This isn't gonna
be a court case.
