00:59.726 --> 01:00.894
I'll save you.

03:32.838 --> 03:34.464
- Did I get anything yesterday?
- Oh...

03:36.216 --> 03:39.010
Let me guess,
Al-Qaeda oven mitts.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.889
Rudy Giuliani placemats.

temperate and nearly cloudless
in the eastern United States.

05:05.263 --> 05:09.309
Honey, you didn't see Bob at
the casino last night, did you?

05:10.143 --> 05:12.687
Temperate and nearly cloudless.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.148
- Okay.
- And nearly cloudless.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.526
Don't forget we're going
to the Golden Corral tonight

05:17.609 --> 05:20.195
to celebrate, okay?
Let's see if we can make it this year.

05:21.488 --> 05:24.741
I put cookies in your bag
in case you get hungry on the bus.

05:25.784 --> 05:26.910
Look good?

05:28.703 --> 05:29.703
Looks good.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.963
On September 11th, 2001,
it was dawned temperate

05:38.046 --> 05:40.757
and nearly cloudless
in the eastern United States.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.426
September 11th, 2001.

06:50.952 --> 06:54.164
<i>The names of the dead</i>
<i>were read at ground zero this morning</i>

06:54.247 --> 06:57.125
<i>on the third anniversary
of the attack on our nation...</i>

07:01.755 --> 07:03.256
Well, hello, Mr. Chipley.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.550
Ned Chipley to see
Master Sergeant Foutz, ma'am.

07:05.634 --> 07:08.470
Oh, Master Sergeant Foutz
is no longer with this office.

07:08.553 --> 07:09.679
He was reassigned.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.224
Do you wanna talk
to Staff Sergeant Kendrick?

07:14.726 --> 07:15.769
Thank you, ma'am.

07:19.689 --> 07:20.689
Sir?

07:21.191 --> 07:23.234
Yes, can you come back
to the front office, please?

07:23.985 --> 07:26.696
Thank you.
He'll be right with you.

07:27.697 --> 07:29.407
- Thank you, ma'am.
- You are welcome.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.629
Ned Chipley reporting for duty, sir.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.382
Easy there, soldier.
What can we do you for?

07:46.800 --> 07:50.095
Sir, I'm tired of these terrorists.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.888
And I'm ready to be a member...

07:53.264 --> 07:56.059
Member of the most elite fighting force
in the world...

07:56.184 --> 07:57.184
sir!

07:58.061 --> 07:59.914
All right, let's talk in Jenkins's office,
shall we?

07:59.938 --> 08:01.398
Yes, thank you, sir.

08:01.773 --> 08:03.608
May I keep this, sir?

08:04.401 --> 08:06.903
If you stop saying "sir,"
you can take whatever you like.

08:10.490 --> 08:11.491
Just relax.

08:12.117 --> 08:13.917
I'm just gonna ask you
some routine questions.

08:18.123 --> 08:19.165
You can take a seat.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.048
Okay.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.176
Did you get my letters, sir?

08:30.719 --> 08:31.719
Your letters?

08:32.011 --> 08:34.681
My training progress,
I sent them to Master Sergeant Foutz.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.393
Well, Master Sergeant Jenkins
just replaced Foutz...

08:39.227 --> 08:42.522
so I don't know anything
about any training letters.

08:44.733 --> 08:45.733
Hm.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.747
We have to get Bin Laden, sir.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.541
We're working on that, son.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.061
Seriously, you don't need
to keep saying "sir."

09:04.085 --> 09:05.211
I'm sorry, sir.

09:07.922 --> 09:10.526
I'm not claustrophobic and I know
how to build a fire and find water.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.736
I've studied survival techniques.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.304
I've been sleeping on the floor
so I can have field readiness.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.931
I've also read the 9/11 commission report.

09:17.015 --> 09:19.455
Is there any medical conditions
we should know about, Chipley?

09:23.146 --> 09:25.586
But I felt like I needed
to improve my physical fitness.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.860
And as you can see, I have done that
by doing the Marine workout,

09:28.943 --> 09:31.571
and through mixed martial arts training
and Jeet Kune Do.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.243
Bruce Lee did Jeet Kune Do.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.165
Master Sergeant Foutz
knows all about this.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.541
Do you know where he is, sir?

09:44.542 --> 09:45.543
I do not.

09:47.754 --> 09:48.754
Can we call him?

09:49.005 --> 09:51.174
Look, it seems like you've put
a lot of time and effort

09:51.257 --> 09:53.510
- into your preparation, so...
- Yes, sir.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.316
If you could just fill this out for me...

09:56.346 --> 09:59.599
- and I will be right back.
- Thank you, sir.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.268
Temperate and nearly cloudless, sir.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.689
What's in the case, soldier?

10:07.482 --> 10:08.691
Chips Ahoy, sir.

10:10.568 --> 10:11.778
Chips Ahoy cookies.

10:49.357 --> 10:52.360
Full body improvement, check.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.406
Jeet Kune Do, check.

10:59.284 --> 11:01.411
Afghanistan, check.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.624
Bin Laden, check.

11:19.387 --> 11:22.724
- This is Master Sergeant Jenkins.
- Ned Chipley reporting for duty, sir.

11:26.269 --> 11:27.269
At ease, son.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.607
Sir, I'm ready.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.705
Ready to be a member of the most
elite fighting force in the world.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.362
And I hate terrorists.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.716
You the young man writing
all those letters to Foutz, son?

11:38.740 --> 11:40.283
Yes, sir. Master Sergeant Foutz.

11:41.492 --> 11:42.492
Hm.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.079
Okay, good.
We got your name and social.

11:45.371 --> 11:46.371
Yes, sir.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.499
This is my fourth attempt to enlist.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.752
Excellent.
I'll tell you what, partner.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.379
We'll run these through
the appropriate channels,

11:53.463 --> 11:55.506
something comes up,
we'll call you first thing.

11:55.590 --> 11:58.635
No, I mean...
I wanna join up right now.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.679
I wanna prove my heroism.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.473
I don't think we can help right now.

12:03.765 --> 12:06.267
Sir, I've made improvements.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.188
Now, hold on a minute.
Just... Wait, hold on a second.

12:10.271 --> 12:11.272
See?

12:11.356 --> 12:13.274
- Ned...
- I put on 15 pounds of muscle mass.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.085
- Son...
- I can do 60 push-ups without stopping

12:15.109 --> 12:16.736
and 100 if you give me
a 30-second break.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.660
I can run six miles in 42 minutes.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.549
- Ned...
- I watch all of Randy Couture's fights.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.093
- I can mix martial arts.
- Now, son...

12:22.158 --> 12:23.677
- That's not how it works.
- Please, sir.

12:23.701 --> 12:24.786
I will go to the caves.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.371
- Okay.
- I will leave no man behind.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.331
Son, please put your shirt back on.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.666
I can do 100 push-ups.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.960
- Forget the break.
- Now, hold on now.

12:32.043 --> 12:33.711
- And, one, two...
- Ned.

12:33.795 --> 12:35.380
- ...three, four...
- Ned.

12:35.463 --> 12:36.543
- ...five...
- Hold on, son.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.092
...six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

12:39.175 --> 12:44.389
11, 12, 13, 14,
15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20...

12:44.514 --> 12:46.575
Now, son, get up
and put your shirt back on.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.310
...21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,

12:49.394 --> 12:52.897
27, 28, 29, 30, 31,

12:52.981 --> 12:55.441
32, 33, 34, 35...

13:10.623 --> 13:13.001
<i>Ned, come on, honey!</i>

13:14.252 --> 13:16.713
<i>Golden Coral, it's your night.
We're gonna have fun.</i>

13:21.092 --> 13:22.092
<i>Let's go!</i>

13:26.347 --> 13:27.947
I don't suppose you've seen him.

13:30.685 --> 13:31.685
No.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.480
He's probably down there
sulking in the cougar suit.

13:34.897 --> 13:38.377
<i>- Same as when they canned him from the hospital.</i>
<i>- There were a lot of cutbacks that year.</i>

13:38.401 --> 13:40.004
Same as when they found
that girl in the lake.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.405
The Andersons were very
grateful for his help.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.866
Same as when he was
the mascot in the first place.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.842
Ned! Oh, my God. - He was gonna score.
- Please, wait.

14:01.299 --> 14:03.384
That's my son. He's not dangerous.
Please let him go.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.710
- Sorry, Mom, he was gonna score.
- Sweetheart, are you all right?

14:05.734 --> 14:07.109
Mom, I got him.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.807
- He just wants to help.
- That's not the point.

14:10.725 --> 14:13.561
I don't know why you let him
chase these pipe dreams, Rose.

14:13.853 --> 14:14.979
The Marine Corps?

14:15.480 --> 14:18.566
He's been going down there
every year since 9/11,

14:18.649 --> 14:20.276
and every year
the same thing happens,

14:20.360 --> 14:21.444
and you're always surprised

14:21.527 --> 14:23.821
when we have to cancel
the kid's birthday dinner.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.993
I mean, they kicked him out
of a volunteer fire department,

14:29.077 --> 14:30.078
for God's sake.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.496
When is enough, enough?

14:31.579 --> 14:33.331
Well, it's not like
you're any help either,

14:33.414 --> 14:35.500
watching those movies
with him every single night.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.960
No one in their right mind
would watch <i>The Deer Hunter</i>

14:38.044 --> 14:39.045
and want to enlist!

14:41.381 --> 14:42.381
Really?

14:45.593 --> 14:46.677
You know what I mean.

14:55.645 --> 14:56.729
Don't worry about it.

14:59.649 --> 15:00.858
The kid's a rubber ball.

15:23.548 --> 15:27.093
Is there a possibility we could watch
something else, just for a change?

15:30.430 --> 15:32.723
- How about <i>Platoon?</i>
- Yeah, well, that's...

15:34.100 --> 15:35.184
Okay, forget it.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.105
I can give you a lift to work,
if you want?

15:39.272 --> 15:41.592
Thought I'd run and see Jojo,
you know, see how he's doing.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.818
I might have to borrow
some gas money though.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.611
Don't tell your mother.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.457
Time to roll, Bobby De Niro.

16:25.651 --> 16:26.903
What did I tell you, Ned?

16:28.029 --> 16:29.697
Don't talk to the customers.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.759
I've been getting a couple complaints.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.748
I was close.

16:40.291 --> 16:43.571
Security, your little friend is back.
All right, I'm leaving, Sameer. I'm leaving.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.715
Back off! I said I'm leaving.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.344
Back off! I said I'm leaving.

16:53.846 --> 16:54.846
Excuse me!

16:55.139 --> 16:56.139
Hey!

16:56.307 --> 16:59.894
Hey, looks like my ride split.
Any chance I can get a lift with you?

16:59.977 --> 17:03.189
You gotta get some new material, honey.
You told me that last week.

17:04.147 --> 17:05.983
Well, what can I say? People leave.

17:07.234 --> 17:09.153
- Come on, the night is young.
- And so are you.

17:09.237 --> 17:10.445
I'll give you this though,

17:10.530 --> 17:12.490
you are a good-looking
little son of a bitch.

17:13.241 --> 17:15.535
But I can't.
I gotta get home to my old lady.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.036
Well, I don't see no ring.

17:17.118 --> 17:18.704
We're old school.
We don't need rings.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.498
Shit, everybody needs a ring.

17:20.580 --> 17:21.665
Have a good one.

17:35.304 --> 17:36.347
Hey, Tally.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.148
Hey, Lyle.

17:47.692 --> 17:51.445
So, um... your boy, Ray, he split.

17:52.822 --> 17:55.575
He said he was hitting up Big Bear
or something.

17:56.492 --> 17:57.535
He's gone?

17:58.286 --> 17:59.286
Yeah.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.666
Whatever.
I wasn't with him anyway.

18:05.126 --> 18:07.962
You was already behind,
so I had to padlock you.

18:09.005 --> 18:12.091
I'm sorry. It's just that I got people
I gotta answer to is all.

18:13.342 --> 18:16.470
'Course, we might could
work something out.

18:20.516 --> 18:21.516
I don't know.

18:56.302 --> 18:57.779
Didn't go to the casino last night?

18:57.803 --> 18:59.283
I told you, I'm done with that place.

19:00.056 --> 19:01.682
Little early for a beer then.

19:06.937 --> 19:09.857
I have been working all night.
It's not the same thing.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.777
- Does it relax you?
- Yes.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.154
Then it's the same thing.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.409
Why don't you give this section a whirl?

19:20.493 --> 19:22.662
Jesus Christ, Rose,
how many times have we been...

19:22.745 --> 19:24.789
Do you think I like
sitting around here all day?

19:25.498 --> 19:28.626
They told me I can't work
or we're gonna lose that settlement.

19:29.043 --> 19:31.420
Somebody takes a picture of me
doing something physical,

19:31.754 --> 19:32.880
we lose the lawsuit.

19:32.963 --> 19:35.216
Well, you at least ought to try
and sell the truck then.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.385
It's been almost a year already.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.555
- Speaking of settlements...
- Nope. Forget it.

19:41.972 --> 19:44.934
That is his.
He's the one that suffered, not you.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.352
- Short-term loan.
- No.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.938
Jerry says they're gonna settle any day.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.421
We'd give him the money right back.

19:51.232 --> 19:52.232
No.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.988
You never should've taught him
how to use eBay.

19:58.906 --> 20:01.492
<i>Ned, I'm in the truck

<i>The bearer of the cross is America.</i>

20:26.225 --> 20:30.688
<i>We will blow you up
and finish you off," end quote.</i>

20:33.107 --> 20:36.318
<i>According to the </i> Washington Post,

20:45.077 --> 20:47.163
I miss it more than I can say, brother.

20:48.122 --> 20:50.082
I'm dying a slow death out here.

20:50.332 --> 20:51.351
<i>Hey, man, I hear you,</i>

20:51.375 --> 20:53.145
<i>but it's worth it.
We're gonna win this thing.</i>

20:53.169 --> 20:55.087
Listen, I gotta split.

20:55.504 --> 20:57.965
I'll keep you posted on the lawsuit.

20:58.048 --> 20:59.884
Say hi to Brains for me, okay?

21:00.050 --> 21:01.594
- Ten-four.
<i>- Roger that.</i>

21:02.636 --> 21:04.096
Hey, welcome back, Ned.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.350
America is the bearer of the cross.

21:08.517 --> 21:09.517
I know it.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.563
Al-Qaeda is alive and well, Bob.

21:13.564 --> 21:15.065
They have to let me help.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.529
You ought to take Paul Delgado's place.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.072
His mom's always going on about

21:22.156 --> 21:24.116
how he wants to come home
from Afghanistan.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.095
Who wants to come home
from Afghanistan?

21:28.996 --> 21:30.039
Paul Delgado.

21:32.625 --> 21:33.793
Two houses down.

21:35.836 --> 21:37.713
You walk his dog, Ned.

21:39.507 --> 21:40.507
Waffles.

21:41.383 --> 21:43.719
A little fluffy white dog
about this big.

21:45.554 --> 21:46.554
Waffles.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.524
Spell Delgado for me.

21:58.734 --> 22:01.654
We'll see, yeah. Delgado.

22:02.488 --> 22:03.489
Here you go.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.244
- Thank you, Bob.
- No problem.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.711
That might not have been a good idea.

22:22.883 --> 22:23.968
Hi, Ned.

22:24.051 --> 22:27.346
I'd like to talk about your son,
Paul Delgado?

22:28.305 --> 22:29.865
I'd also like a picture of him, please.

22:32.852 --> 22:33.894
Hello, Waffles.

22:35.062 --> 22:37.815
You know, all these years,

22:37.898 --> 22:39.567
we've never really been anywhere.

22:39.984 --> 22:41.902
- Lake Hav...
- Don't say Lake Havasu.

22:47.283 --> 22:49.535
Well, when you spend your life
on the road,

22:49.869 --> 22:52.830
you know, the last thing
you wanna do with your downtime is travel.

22:52.913 --> 22:55.332
I have lived here my entire life.

22:55.791 --> 22:57.167
I never thought that would happen.

22:57.251 --> 22:59.837
I wouldn't worry about it.
I mean, travel's overrated.

23:00.421 --> 23:02.673
One place,
pretty much the same as another.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.177
Yeah. That doesn't sound right.

23:15.561 --> 23:16.812
Where's my shake?

23:20.316 --> 23:21.316
Al-Qaeda.

23:22.902 --> 23:25.696
Thank you, Bob.
I'll get it for you, honey.

23:27.323 --> 23:28.866
You got a good sweat going there.

23:29.742 --> 23:30.742
It's hot.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.595
Ned Chipley to see
Master Sergeant Foutz, ma'am.

24:31.971 --> 24:35.808
I... I told you, Master Sergeant Foutz
was reassigned to a different office.

24:41.105 --> 24:44.066
- Staff Sergeant Kendrick?
- He's not here today.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.112
- Master Sergeant Jenkins?
- He's unavailable right now.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.155
I am not sure when his schedule
is gonna open up.

24:50.280 --> 24:52.324
That's okay. I'm off work today.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.493
Oh. Okay.

24:59.707 --> 25:01.083
Why don't you take a seat, Ned?

25:02.334 --> 25:03.377
Thank you, ma'am.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.049
Do you need some food
or water or something?

25:09.133 --> 25:10.634
I need very little food or water.

25:10.718 --> 25:12.011
I have field readiness.

25:13.303 --> 25:14.346
That's good.

25:19.184 --> 25:20.686
Do you know Paul Delgado, ma'am?

25:21.311 --> 25:22.855
No, I don't think so.

25:23.564 --> 25:24.815
This is Paul Delgado.

25:26.984 --> 25:29.486
He's a Marine and he would like
to come home right now.

25:29.903 --> 25:31.155
I'm gonna take his place.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.199
Right now, I just walk his dog.

25:35.576 --> 25:36.577
Waffles.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.330
I don't have a picture of the dog,

25:40.581 --> 25:42.833
but it's white and fluffy
and about this big.

25:43.333 --> 25:48.005
Or... well, actually it's about...

25:49.965 --> 25:51.550
Sir?

25:52.593 --> 25:55.637
No, I know what you said.
I'm sorry, sir. Yes, I'm just...

25:57.097 --> 25:59.451
I just thought you should know
that Ned Chipley is here again.

25:59.475 --> 26:00.517
What?

26:01.268 --> 26:03.437
He's saying that he'd like to...

26:03.520 --> 26:04.897
Is that Master Sergeant Jenkins?

26:05.606 --> 26:07.399
That he'd like to take the place of...

26:07.524 --> 26:08.524
Paul Delgado.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.277
Paul Delgado.

26:10.360 --> 26:11.487
Tell him about the dog.

26:11.570 --> 26:13.697
And he has a dog.

26:13.781 --> 26:16.116
- Named...
- Named Waffles.

26:16.617 --> 26:17.618
Thank you.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.538
Master Sergeant Jenkins
will see you now.

26:21.622 --> 26:22.831
Thank you, ma'am.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.666
What's this all about, son?

26:24.750 --> 26:26.335
Al-Qaeda is alive and well, sir.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.630
Okay. What's this about, specifically?

26:31.215 --> 26:32.966
Paul Delgado would like to come home.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.011
And I'll take his place.

26:37.387 --> 26:40.099
That's...
That's not how it works, Ned.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.976
You just can't take someone's place.

26:43.477 --> 26:48.649
A military outfit is about cohesion.
It's about uniformity, it's...

26:48.982 --> 26:50.692
Stop writing and listen to me.

26:55.489 --> 26:57.324
- Ned...
- What is that?

27:05.582 --> 27:07.626
Can I have this, sir?

27:09.378 --> 27:13.215
Ned... why do you wanna
join the Marines?

27:13.298 --> 27:17.219
And don't quote the brochure,
just tell me in your own words.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.557
I hate terrorists, sir.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.561
And I want to save lives.

27:26.186 --> 27:27.688
- Save lives?
- Yes, sir.

27:31.316 --> 27:32.317
Shut the door.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.987
Let me tell you something.
Have a seat.

27:35.529 --> 27:37.114
I'll give you the poster already.

27:43.287 --> 27:44.663
There's an old saying.

27:45.497 --> 27:47.958
Here, give me one of those cards,
I'll write it down for you.

27:48.917 --> 27:49.960
It says...

27:51.378 --> 27:57.301
"An immature man
wants to die nobly for a cause,

27:57.634 --> 28:04.474
but a mature man
wants to live humbly for one."

28:08.061 --> 28:10.439
What that means, Ned,
is we're in danger at home.

28:10.856 --> 28:13.233
We need good people
looking after things here.

28:13.817 --> 28:14.860
I mean, sure,

28:14.943 --> 28:17.154
everybody wants to put on
a uniform and be a hero,

28:17.321 --> 28:20.115
but... the real heroes

28:20.199 --> 28:22.117
are the ones looking after
their fellow citizens

28:22.201 --> 28:23.577
here on the home front.

28:28.081 --> 28:29.374
The home front.

28:30.209 --> 28:32.586
Didn't you say Al-Qaeda
was alive and well?

28:33.462 --> 28:34.462
Yes, sir.

28:34.755 --> 28:36.798
Then there's bound to be sleeper cells
everywhere.

28:37.799 --> 28:39.676
Right under our noses, even.

28:40.385 --> 28:43.138
Chances are, they're gonna keep
attacking us where we live,

28:43.388 --> 28:45.641
at the malls, at the supermarkets.

28:46.099 --> 28:48.518
We need good people
looking after things here.

28:49.228 --> 28:50.854
Special Operatives, if you will.

28:54.483 --> 28:56.068
You want me to be a Special Operative?

28:56.151 --> 28:57.319
Absolutely.

28:59.279 --> 29:02.479
- So I'll be a Marine? - Uh... - A Special Operative.
- Marine Special Operative.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.578
No. Don't tell people
you're a Marine, Ned.

29:06.662 --> 29:09.456
You don't wanna compromise
yourself or this office.

29:09.539 --> 29:10.874
Can I have a gun, sir?

29:14.336 --> 29:16.129
Weapons draw
the wrong kind of attention.

29:16.213 --> 29:18.465
What can I have then,
besides that poster?

29:29.601 --> 29:30.769
Okay.

29:32.479 --> 29:34.314
Be very careful with these, Ned.

29:34.856 --> 29:38.402
On them are the 52 biggest
terrorist threats in the world.

29:44.074 --> 29:45.575
Saddam is the Ace of spades?

29:45.909 --> 29:47.661
Those are the men you're looking for

29:48.203 --> 29:49.997
and anyone associated with them.

29:50.664 --> 29:52.874
And what I need you to do, Ned,
is be vigilant.

29:53.583 --> 29:56.336
Can you do that for me?
Be vigilant?

29:57.462 --> 30:00.257
Vigilant? Absolutely, sir.

30:00.841 --> 30:02.259
What is my unit's nickname?

30:02.634 --> 30:04.344
- Am I Devil Dog?
- No.

30:04.845 --> 30:05.887
You're a...

30:10.142 --> 30:12.060
You know what a Sun Dog is, Ned?

30:14.354 --> 30:16.481
Wait, hold on, look. Let me show you.

30:18.442 --> 30:20.277
You see the sun in the middle here?

30:20.402 --> 30:21.402
Mm-hm.

30:21.737 --> 30:23.655
Picture that as, say, the...

30:23.739 --> 30:26.033
the Marines in Iraq and Afghanistan.

30:26.533 --> 30:27.534
And these...

30:28.744 --> 30:30.162
those are Sun Dogs.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.039
They're just as important,

30:32.664 --> 30:35.042
but they shine their light
off to the side of the sun,

30:35.625 --> 30:38.170
which is kinda like
what you'll be doing here,

30:38.628 --> 30:42.007
at home, as a Special Operative.

30:43.467 --> 30:46.053
So, I'm a Sun Dog, not a Devil Dog?

30:46.136 --> 30:47.456
Right. But there are two of them.

30:53.060 --> 30:55.729
Well, Sun Dogs often come in pairs,

30:55.812 --> 30:58.690
but let's not get too caught up
in the details, Ned.

31:03.487 --> 31:05.113
Sir, how do I contact you?

31:05.405 --> 31:07.657
Here. Here's my card.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.120
Thank you, sir.

31:14.331 --> 31:15.540
Welcome to the fight.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.554
Can I get that poster, sir?

31:42.609 --> 31:44.569
<i>The rumors of gold</i>

31:44.653 --> 31:45.946
<i>long before...</i>

31:46.905 --> 31:49.658
<i>The Spanish Explorer,
Juan Bautista de Anza,</i>

31:49.741 --> 31:52.452
<i>- for whom the California town is named...</i>
- Hey, that's us.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.037
I can't do this.

31:55.622 --> 31:58.333
I wrote the directions down.
Just go step-by-step.

31:59.960 --> 32:01.800
- I... I don't think I can.
- Hold your horses.

32:02.754 --> 32:05.132
They're talking about buried gold
right around the corner.

32:06.133 --> 32:08.213
And turn that printer off.
Take that stuff to Kinkos.

32:08.969 --> 32:11.513
- They can do this at Kinkos?
- That's what they do at Kinkos.

32:11.596 --> 32:12.949
But you don't know what I'm doing.

32:12.973 --> 32:14.450
And I don't wanna know what you're doing.

32:14.474 --> 32:16.674
But I know whatever it is,
Kinkos is gonna do it better.

32:17.561 --> 32:18.770
I gotta order the show now,

32:18.854 --> 32:20.772
I missed half the damn thing
dealing with you.

32:21.148 --> 32:23.733
I'll get it for you on eBay,
they have everything.

32:23.859 --> 32:25.026
You don't say.

32:39.458 --> 32:40.584
Nice.

32:41.835 --> 32:45.088
And, there you go. There's 2,000
of those puppies right there.

32:46.006 --> 32:47.966
Whoa, these are awesome.

32:48.049 --> 32:50.969
Yeah, no, thanks.
I thought they turned out good.

32:52.429 --> 32:54.890
Al-Qaeda's alive and well
here in the United States.

32:56.308 --> 32:59.311
There are sleeper cells everywhere,
right under our noses.

32:59.603 --> 33:03.283
Chances are they're gonna keep attacking us where
we live. At malls, in supermarkets, Kinkos.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.360
- What, are you being serious?
- Oh, yes.

33:08.028 --> 33:09.404
We have to be vigilant.

33:10.697 --> 33:11.697
Here.

33:13.241 --> 33:15.321
My email is on the bottom,
but you already know that.

33:16.077 --> 33:18.163
Okay. Who are you?

33:18.455 --> 33:19.706
The name is Chipley.

33:19.873 --> 33:22.667
I'm with Master Sergeant Jenkins' unit,
out of San Diego.

33:23.835 --> 33:24.961
They call us Sun Dogs.

33:25.045 --> 33:27.714
Okay, and if I wanted to be a Sun Dog,

33:27.797 --> 33:29.757
- is there more information?
- Don't say anything.

33:30.175 --> 33:31.468
Don't say anything about what?

33:33.386 --> 33:34.746
America's the bearer of the cross.

33:35.222 --> 33:36.681
- Dude.
- Hello, sir.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.391
- Are you serious?
- Name is Chipley.

33:38.475 --> 33:39.809
My email's on the bottom.

33:40.519 --> 33:41.603
Be vigilant.

33:44.231 --> 33:45.649
Hello, ma'am.

33:46.983 --> 33:49.027
Ned Chipley.
My email's on the bottom.

33:51.613 --> 33:54.824
Ma'am, my name is Ned Chipley.
My email is on the bottom.

33:56.117 --> 33:58.828
<i>Welcome back,</i>
<i>it's time to meet our next contestant</i>

33:58.912 --> 34:00.747
<i>from Anza, California.</i>

34:00.830 --> 34:03.458
<i>We have nursing student,
Rose Chipley.</i>

34:03.542 --> 34:06.545
<i>It says here you'd like to live
in New York City one day, Rose.</i>

34:07.128 --> 34:09.065
<i>My girlfriends and I tried</i>
<i>to get on </i> The Price is Right

34:09.089 --> 34:10.590
<i>to try and win a trip there.</i>

34:11.257 --> 34:13.842
<i>Oh, my God, can I say that?
Can I say another show?</i>

34:15.262 --> 34:17.973
<i>Well, we'll leave that up</i>
<i>to the editing crew, Rose.</i>

34:18.056 --> 34:20.891
<i>In the meantime, maybe you can win
some cold hard cash</i>

34:20.976 --> 34:23.103
<i>to help you to get to New York City.</i>

34:34.572 --> 34:37.534
Did I ever tell you
I wanted to live in New York

34:37.617 --> 34:38.659
when I was younger?

34:38.743 --> 34:40.036
Be an EMT?

34:41.121 --> 34:42.621
Thought that'd be exciting.

34:44.416 --> 34:48.295
Go to New York, be an EMT.

34:51.297 --> 34:55.176
But you can't just go to New York
and be an EMT at my age.

34:56.219 --> 34:59.723
Have to get the credentials
for one thing.

35:02.559 --> 35:03.727
Get the credentials.

35:08.982 --> 35:10.150
I'll save you.

35:13.403 --> 35:16.239
It's very difficult to learn
a new vocation as an adult.

35:16.990 --> 35:20.076
Of course, my nursing background
puts me nearly all the way there, but I...

35:20.952 --> 35:22.037
I don't know.

35:31.087 --> 35:34.090
You're right, I'm making excuses.

35:54.653 --> 35:57.197
Yes! Oh, my God!

36:08.792 --> 36:10.669
Sir, are you okay? Oh, my God.

36:10.752 --> 36:12.188
- Oh, my God.
- Call an ambulance.

36:12.212 --> 36:14.148
- Call an ambulance right away.
- Can you breathe?

36:14.172 --> 36:16.020
- Are you all right, sir?
- Get out of the way.

36:16.044 --> 36:17.920
- He's not breathing.
- Security, if you could...

36:17.944 --> 36:20.220
- Get out of here.
- Somebody needs to help him!

36:20.303 --> 36:22.406
- Call an ambulance!
- An ambulance is on the way, sir.

36:22.430 --> 36:24.265
Just take a deep breath.

36:24.641 --> 36:25.641
Relax.

36:25.684 --> 36:26.768
Excuse me, ma'am?

36:27.811 --> 36:29.104
- Ma'am?
- I'm already leaving.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.272
- Wait.
- What? What do you want?

36:31.648 --> 36:33.942
Shouldn't you be cleaning the toilet
or something?

36:34.025 --> 36:36.277
- Julio and Mark do the toilets.
- Congratulations.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.530
Wait. Do you know that guy
who grabbed you inside?

36:38.613 --> 36:39.864
Who, Osama Bin Laden?

36:40.740 --> 36:41.950
That's not Osama Bin Laden.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.953
No shit, it's not Osama Bin Laden,
are you serious?

36:45.036 --> 36:46.204
Can you keep a secret?

36:52.669 --> 36:54.379
- No way.
- Mm-hm.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.340
I'm with the Sun Dogs.

36:58.758 --> 37:01.261
Master Sergeant Jenkins’ unit
out of San Diego.

37:01.928 --> 37:03.972
Al-Qaeda is alive and well.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.392
Why are you wearing that outfit?

37:09.310 --> 37:12.272
Oh, oh, I get it.
You're undercover.

37:15.608 --> 37:16.860
This is crazy.

37:16.943 --> 37:18.343
There are sleeper cells everywhere.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.573
And I hate terrorists.

37:24.367 --> 37:26.178
Oh, my God, if there is anything
more depressing

37:26.202 --> 37:29.122
than dying in a shitty casino,
I don't know what it is.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.545
Any man ever grabs you
like that again,

37:35.628 --> 37:37.172
- just go like this.
- Oh.

37:38.631 --> 37:39.674
Martial arts.

37:41.426 --> 37:42.886
- Thanks.
- Sure.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.429
Leave no man behind.

37:49.893 --> 37:51.933
Excuse me, sir?

38:02.906 --> 38:04.199
My name is Ned Chipley.

38:04.449 --> 38:06.951
I'm with the Sun Dogs.
Master Sergeant Jenkins’ unit.

38:07.744 --> 38:08.745
Be vigilant.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.747
<i>So, let me get this straight.</i>

38:10.914 --> 38:12.123
You want to be a nurse?

38:12.207 --> 38:14.167
- I am a nurse.
- But on wheels.

38:15.585 --> 38:17.045
Okay.

38:17.128 --> 38:18.129
Excuse me.

40:11.284 --> 40:12.577
Why do you take the bus?

40:12.869 --> 40:14.537
- I can't drive.
- Why?

40:15.496 --> 40:16.789
Did you get hurt or something?

40:18.625 --> 40:20.251
Is that scar from the war?

40:25.298 --> 40:27.300
Sorry.
You don't have to answer that.

40:27.383 --> 40:28.384
I didn't mean to pry.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.437
- Stay here.
- Well, can't I come in?

40:40.813 --> 40:41.813
Fine.

40:42.649 --> 40:45.026
But you could...
Could you tell them that...

40:45.652 --> 40:48.529
I could drive you, 'cause, like,
you're gonna need a driver

40:48.696 --> 40:50.073
to follow them around.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.201
- Hm.
- So...

40:54.994 --> 40:56.204
Don't forget to tell them.

41:15.807 --> 41:16.807
Thank you, sir.

41:17.350 --> 41:18.518
- See you later.
- Okay.

41:18.601 --> 41:19.601
All right.

41:23.856 --> 41:25.316
Is that the case you forgot?

41:25.817 --> 41:27.402
Are there important documents in there?

41:28.987 --> 41:30.196
Welcome to the fight.

41:30.989 --> 41:33.300
<i>Four soldiers were killed</i>
<i>in Afghanistan yesterday</i>

41:33.324 --> 41:34.324
<i>when a car bomb...</i>

41:34.367 --> 41:39.288
Here's your credit card and here
is Ms. Petersen's license, Mr. Chipley.

41:39.956 --> 41:42.393
<i>We should have more about</i>
<i>this attack later on in the day.</i>

41:42.417 --> 41:43.730
Be vigilant.

41:43.876 --> 41:44.876
Okay.

41:45.461 --> 41:47.690
We have Uday's address
and we're about to get on his tail.

41:47.714 --> 41:48.881
Do you have anything to say?

41:50.049 --> 41:52.218
Four soldiers were killed
in Afghanistan yesterday

41:52.301 --> 41:53.553
when a car bomb exploded.

41:54.429 --> 41:55.430
Did you know them?

42:01.602 --> 42:02.602
Those are nice.

42:03.354 --> 42:05.023
Are those special-issued shades?

42:11.070 --> 42:12.905
You been to a lot of places, Ned?

42:13.614 --> 42:14.907
A lot of places.

42:14.991 --> 42:17.785
Yeah, I've been to a lot of places too,
but...

42:18.703 --> 42:20.538
they've all been shitholes
just like this one.

42:20.955 --> 42:22.540
- Shitholes?
- Mm-hm.

42:22.623 --> 42:23.624
Mm-hm.

42:26.002 --> 42:27.920
You come here
after you got injured?

42:28.254 --> 42:30.631
Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to.

42:31.632 --> 42:33.009
You don't have to tell me.

42:34.177 --> 42:36.721
Maybe you'll tell me
when you get to know me better.

42:37.055 --> 42:39.640
And I'll tell you a few things
when I get to know you better too,

42:39.724 --> 42:41.124
so it'll be a fair deal. Fair deal.

42:42.143 --> 42:44.062
Do you...
Do you live with people?

42:45.188 --> 42:46.814
Like other Marines? I don't...

42:47.356 --> 42:49.692
I don't know how this
counter-terrorism stuff works.

42:54.238 --> 42:55.448
I'll just shut up now.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.744
Most guys just want you to shut up.

42:59.827 --> 43:01.412
Unless they want to get in your pants.

43:01.788 --> 43:02.872
I live with my mother.

43:04.248 --> 43:05.248
And Bob.

43:05.792 --> 43:07.335
Okay. Oh.

43:09.545 --> 43:10.922
You know what? That is...

43:11.672 --> 43:14.467
That's actually pretty smart
from an undercover standpoint.

43:14.842 --> 43:16.762
You work as a janitor,
you live with your mother.

43:16.803 --> 43:19.180
That's...
No one would ever expect that.

43:19.263 --> 43:20.848
That's kind of genius.

43:21.474 --> 43:23.893
Holy shit, look.

43:24.352 --> 43:25.394
Holy shit.

43:26.312 --> 43:29.398
A white van? Very fishy.

43:35.154 --> 43:36.965
Al-Qaeda is alive and well
here in America.

43:36.989 --> 43:38.449
Man, you got that right.

43:39.367 --> 43:41.369
- This is so awesome.
- You like it?

43:41.452 --> 43:43.746
- Yes.
- Look, I can add graphics.

43:45.039 --> 43:47.875
My mom lived with a million losers,

43:47.959 --> 43:49.794
but this one guy, Ben, was all right.

43:50.294 --> 43:53.214
He cut music videos
and he taught me all this stuff.

43:54.507 --> 43:55.967
You're really good at this.

43:56.884 --> 43:59.720
Well, I'm good at a lot of things.

44:00.429 --> 44:02.140
We need to get this to Jenkins.

44:08.479 --> 44:10.398
<i>Dear Master Sergeant Jenkins,</i>

44:10.773 --> 44:13.609
<i>the nine of spades
are on field, three friends.</i>

44:13.985 --> 44:16.362
<i>They do not look like any
of the other cards in the deck.</i>

44:16.654 --> 44:17.974
<i>But they are driving a white van.</i>

44:18.990 --> 44:20.741
<i>And that's very fishy.</i>

44:25.496 --> 44:26.656
That's not what I said.

44:27.331 --> 44:29.500
What I said was
I didn't get the point.

44:32.003 --> 44:33.462
- <i>Ned!</i>
- Ned.

44:43.806 --> 44:44.806
Nice.

44:48.436 --> 44:50.563
Part of me wants to know
what's going on,

44:50.646 --> 44:51.646
part of me doesn't.

44:52.064 --> 44:54.942
I think it's sweet, whatever it is.

44:58.446 --> 45:00.698
I'm supposed to have three of these,
did you take one?

45:03.951 --> 45:05.661
- More supplies.
- Mmm.

45:08.998 --> 45:10.082
I'm going in there.

45:11.375 --> 45:12.375
He'll see you.

45:12.418 --> 45:15.087
Well, one of us has to,
and you work with him so you're out.

45:15.379 --> 45:17.256
- Mm.
- I'll just keep my distance.

45:17.340 --> 45:20.343
Now, hold the camera still like I...

45:22.094 --> 45:23.304
You crack me up.

45:23.888 --> 45:26.432
You can assemble a rifle in 15 seconds,

45:26.515 --> 45:27.808
but you can't use a camera.

45:27.892 --> 45:30.478
It's like you're ill equipped
to be a civilian.

45:30.937 --> 45:32.230
Oh. Hold on.

45:34.106 --> 45:35.274
What's that?

45:35.650 --> 45:36.650
Here.

45:40.529 --> 45:42.240
Sun Dogs often come in pairs.

45:44.325 --> 45:45.534
These are for me?

45:47.203 --> 45:48.203
Yeah.

45:52.166 --> 45:53.709
I'm a Sun Dog now?

45:56.003 --> 45:57.046
Mm-hm.

46:19.360 --> 46:20.361
Be right back.

46:20.903 --> 46:21.903
Okay.

46:54.562 --> 46:57.106
How cool do we look
in our matching shades?

46:57.189 --> 46:59.317
- What did he buy?
- More fishy stuff.

46:59.775 --> 47:02.445
Some epoxy glue,
some other kind of glues,

47:02.528 --> 47:03.612
some paint.

47:04.280 --> 47:05.614
I got the receipt.

47:05.990 --> 47:06.866
How?

47:06.991 --> 47:08.367
I flirted with the check-out guy.

47:14.874 --> 47:18.836
<i>Dear Master Sergeant Jenkins,
more fishy stuff.</i>

47:18.919 --> 47:21.630
<i>They bought epoxy glue,
some other kind of glue,</i>

47:21.714 --> 47:23.549
<i>some fuel, and some paint.</i>

47:23.966 --> 47:26.135
<i>We got the receipt. This is it.</i>

48:00.169 --> 48:01.295
You got it, right?

48:02.546 --> 48:03.546
Ned?

48:04.048 --> 48:05.549
- Tally?
- You got the plan, right?

48:06.384 --> 48:08.719
Yes. You're really good
at making plans.

48:08.803 --> 48:10.864
All right. So, when you see me,
you distract the guards,

48:10.888 --> 48:12.448
so Uday'll have to drag me out himself,

48:12.473 --> 48:14.713
I'll pick his pocket,
it'll be a piece of cake, trust me.

48:16.977 --> 48:18.854
Once I pick his pocket,
we'll have his phone,

48:18.938 --> 48:20.481
and then we'll have all his contacts.

48:20.564 --> 48:22.124
- That'll be good, right?
- Right.

48:22.149 --> 48:24.485
Okay, okay.

48:24.944 --> 48:26.612
Glad to see you. Yes. I'll be...

48:27.405 --> 48:29.990
Okay. Don't run. I'm leaving.

48:30.783 --> 48:33.327
Get your hands off!
Don't touch me!

48:33.411 --> 48:35.746
No! I'm not doing this! I'm not.

48:37.081 --> 48:40.793
I didn't do anything wrong!
Okay. We're doing it this way.

48:41.627 --> 48:43.087
All right. I'm not getting down!

48:43.170 --> 48:45.798
Oh, my God. Stop resisting.
Ned! Ned!

48:46.882 --> 48:50.344
Ned, Ned, what are you doing?
Ned, what are you doing?

48:50.428 --> 48:52.948
<i>...please report</i>
<i>to the front lobby immediately.</i>

48:53.097 --> 48:54.825
I'm not gonna ask you
what you were thinking,

48:54.849 --> 48:56.827
but it's interesting,
the minute you start dating girls,

48:56.851 --> 48:59.395
you wind up in the can.
I think there's a lesson there.

48:59.478 --> 49:02.857
I'm just playing with you, Ned.
Don't go all UFC on me.

49:02.982 --> 49:04.382
And I'm not gonna tell your mother,

49:04.442 --> 49:07.194
'cause God knows you kept your mouth shut
about me enough times.

49:07.278 --> 49:09.572
Good news is,
they're not gonna press charges.

49:09.655 --> 49:11.615
Bad news is,
you're out of a job again.

49:11.907 --> 49:14.553
But what the hell would you wanna work
for anyone with the cash you have?

49:14.577 --> 49:16.454
Listen. I wanna talk to you
about something.

49:17.079 --> 49:21.500
Why don't you and I go in
some kinda little business, kid, huh?

49:22.209 --> 49:23.210
What do you think?

49:24.086 --> 49:25.796
Well, think about it.
We'll talk about it.

49:26.297 --> 49:28.632
Come up with a couple of things.

50:20.351 --> 50:21.936
Well, now it all makes sense.

50:24.355 --> 50:26.315
Hey! I'm Tally.

50:27.107 --> 50:28.107
Uh...

50:28.651 --> 50:30.152
- How's Ned?
- He's fine.

50:30.694 --> 50:32.238
They're not gonna press charges.

50:32.321 --> 50:34.641
Yeah. I figured Master Sergeant
Jenkins would get involved.

50:34.698 --> 50:36.742
- Who?
- Ned's Commander.

50:36.992 --> 50:39.161
Look, I don't know what you're pulling,
but...

50:39.828 --> 50:42.122
why don't you hustle somebody else, okay?

50:46.710 --> 50:47.710
Did you get it?

50:48.254 --> 50:52.174
I... I... I got all his texts
and contacts going back six months,

50:52.258 --> 50:53.842
and I printed it out at Kinkos.

50:54.176 --> 50:55.427
Kinkos is awesome.

51:00.015 --> 51:01.934
Bye, Bob. Have a nice day.

51:02.184 --> 51:03.352
Nice to meet you.

51:03.435 --> 51:05.938
Ned, you are my hero.

51:08.399 --> 51:10.192
<i>Okay. Yassir.</i>

51:10.276 --> 51:12.653
Y-A-S-S-I-R.

51:17.324 --> 51:19.868
I still cannot get over
how you put that guy to sleep.

51:21.036 --> 51:22.705
That was badass.

51:22.997 --> 51:24.797
And you didn't have
to blow your cover for me.

51:24.832 --> 51:26.959
I could've kicked their asses
if I wanted to.

51:29.211 --> 51:30.296
But thank you.

51:31.589 --> 51:33.090
I'm never gonna forget that.

51:34.842 --> 51:36.176
Never forget, right?

51:37.636 --> 51:38.637
Never forget.

51:40.639 --> 51:42.308
Is this the only place you got hurt?

51:44.143 --> 51:47.646
Or did you get hurt another place?

51:49.481 --> 51:50.899
You can tell me, you know,

51:50.983 --> 51:53.402
I read <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>
before I dropped out.

51:56.488 --> 51:58.449
<i>Dear Master Sergeant Jenkins,</i>

51:58.532 --> 52:00.993
<i>please run a check
on the following names.</i>

52:03.120 --> 52:07.124
<i>Jamal Abur, Jaheim Dean...</i>

52:08.584 --> 52:10.794
<i>Eric Ramirez...</i>

52:12.212 --> 52:14.298
<i>Joseph Gilvenstein...</i>

52:15.674 --> 52:16.842
<i>Yassir Bah.</i>

52:21.889 --> 52:24.892
Did Bob say anything to you
by any chance?

52:24.975 --> 52:26.852
My mom said to ask you
for Thanksgiving.

52:28.020 --> 52:29.313
- Really?
- Yeah.

52:29.605 --> 52:30.856
What did Bob say?

52:31.023 --> 52:32.024
Bob...

52:33.275 --> 52:34.735
was buying lottery tickets.

52:35.819 --> 52:37.988
And my mom yelled at him.

52:40.240 --> 52:41.240
Well...

52:42.117 --> 52:43.619
I have plans on Thanksgiving.

52:44.036 --> 52:46.080
Okay.

53:00.928 --> 53:02.054
What does that mean?

53:02.805 --> 53:03.805
Hm?

53:06.767 --> 53:08.936
How did you get through school
and not read this?

53:10.896 --> 53:13.440
You'll read the 9/11
Commission Report and not this.

53:16.944 --> 53:18.445
The title's from the book.

53:19.405 --> 53:22.408
Holden's sister, Phoebe, asks him
what he wants to do with his life,

53:22.491 --> 53:23.575
what job or whatever,

53:24.535 --> 53:26.415
and he says he wants to be
a catcher in the rye.

53:27.621 --> 53:31.834
If, like, a group of kids
are playing in a field, a field of rye,

53:32.501 --> 53:34.381
and one of them runs over
and falls off a cliff,

53:34.461 --> 53:36.046
he'd swoop in and catch them.

53:40.259 --> 53:41.343
I could do that.

53:41.969 --> 53:43.846
Well, it's not a real job, though.

53:43.929 --> 53:45.347
It's just something he imagined.

53:45.639 --> 53:47.307
That's the problem, it's a fantasy.

53:47.641 --> 53:49.435
There's no real job like that.

53:50.394 --> 53:51.645
That's kinda the whole point.

53:52.646 --> 53:54.106
He's not living in reality.

54:08.912 --> 54:10.038
Come on, Ned.

54:10.414 --> 54:13.083
There's not been anything for hours.
He's probably asleep.

54:14.001 --> 54:16.837
There's a bottle of peach schnapps
at my place with our names on it.

54:20.340 --> 54:22.801
Okay...

54:22.926 --> 54:25.179
Yep. Here it is. You want a sip?

54:26.013 --> 54:29.016
Let's make another movie.
You're really good at those.

54:29.683 --> 54:30.684
Well, I appreciate that,

54:30.809 --> 54:33.312
but we're missing a little thing
called electricity right now.

54:33.896 --> 54:34.896
Here.

54:37.858 --> 54:39.234
I thought our names were on it.

54:39.526 --> 54:41.487
Ha-ha.

54:45.991 --> 54:47.284
That burns my throat.

54:47.367 --> 54:49.286
You've never had peach schnapps before?

54:49.369 --> 54:50.537
- No.
- Oh.

54:52.414 --> 54:53.499
Can we play the car game?

54:54.875 --> 54:56.960
- I've been doing it all day.
- Do the car game.

55:00.130 --> 55:03.634
All right,
but only because you like it.

55:04.384 --> 55:06.512
- Come back here.
- What?

55:06.595 --> 55:08.680
Come on, come back here,
lay down for a sec.

55:22.486 --> 55:23.862
- Who are they?
- Oh.

55:24.530 --> 55:25.697
Oh, man. That's...

55:26.240 --> 55:28.492
Ann Marie Silvano and her four kids.

55:29.409 --> 55:30.953
They're moving to Reno.

55:31.578 --> 55:35.249
Ann Marie's husband, Phil,
lost his job as a pharmaceutical salesman

55:35.332 --> 55:37.876
and learned to deal blackjack
so he's been there a month,

55:37.960 --> 55:39.000
and now they're following.

55:39.586 --> 55:42.256
But Ann Marie doesn't know
that Phil's been banging

55:42.339 --> 55:44.883
a cocktail waitress at Harrah's
for the past three weeks.

55:44.967 --> 55:46.134
- No.
- Yep.

55:46.218 --> 55:47.427
- Phil?
- Yep.

55:47.511 --> 55:48.887
- Jerk.
- I know.

55:50.848 --> 55:53.688
All five of them are about to go up
to Wyoming to live with her parents,

55:53.809 --> 55:55.727
- but guess what?
- What?

55:55.811 --> 55:58.331
Her parents aren't gonna be there,
'cause they're gonna die in a fire

55:58.355 --> 56:00.732
of unknown origins in the next week.

56:02.651 --> 56:03.902
We have to save them.

56:06.738 --> 56:09.366
You're too cute, you know that?
It's just a game.

56:10.534 --> 56:12.661
- It's a good game.
- Yeah, I know.

56:13.954 --> 56:17.249
My mom and I used to play it
when we lived in a trailer in Arkansas.

56:18.959 --> 56:21.837
After we'd get home from the drive-in
we'd go to all the time,

56:21.920 --> 56:24.047
we'd lay in our bed

56:24.131 --> 56:26.800
and we'd just make believe
like we were rolling along

56:26.884 --> 56:28.510
with every car that passed by.

56:29.052 --> 56:32.472
And before I fell asleep,
I'd ask her where we'd be in the morning

56:32.723 --> 56:36.101
and she always said,
"San Francisco, baby girl."

56:36.226 --> 56:38.562
Because she'd never been there

56:38.645 --> 56:40.814
and she'd heard it was
the prettiest city in the world.

56:42.900 --> 56:43.901
It was fun.

56:46.987 --> 56:48.947
It also sucked
because when you woke up,

56:49.031 --> 56:50.157
you were still in Arkansas.

56:50.282 --> 56:52.159
Hm.

56:55.829 --> 56:57.164
Hey, you wanna see something?

56:58.248 --> 56:59.249
Yeah.

57:03.045 --> 57:04.045
That's us.

57:05.380 --> 57:07.007
I think we were in Biloxi.

57:11.720 --> 57:13.096
My mom was a hottie.

57:13.931 --> 57:17.351
Her self-esteem was for shit though,
that's why she 86'd herself.

57:18.644 --> 57:19.644
She what?

57:21.480 --> 57:22.648
She killed herself.

57:28.278 --> 57:29.278
How?

57:33.241 --> 57:34.660
Threw herself off a bridge.

57:40.666 --> 57:42.084
I could show you something else.

57:44.586 --> 57:46.755
Here, take another sip. Go on.

57:57.224 --> 57:58.684
This is my mom's note.

58:00.894 --> 58:02.104
You wanna see it?

58:03.647 --> 58:04.647
Yes.

58:13.198 --> 58:14.282
Can you read it?

58:25.460 --> 58:27.462
"I'm walking to the train station.

58:27.879 --> 58:30.799
If one person says hello
or asks me how I am today,

58:30.882 --> 58:32.342
I will not kill myself."

58:39.933 --> 58:42.978
Obviously, no one said hello
or asked her how she was.

58:45.647 --> 58:47.482
Everyone thinks it was an accident.

58:47.566 --> 58:49.818
When the cops came by,
I didn't show them the note.

58:50.110 --> 58:52.320
- Why?
- Because fuck them, that's why.

59:06.710 --> 59:09.087
I don't even know why I keep this,
I should throw it out.

59:09.171 --> 59:10.172
Can I have it?

59:13.008 --> 59:14.092
You want it?

59:15.469 --> 59:16.470
Yes.

59:25.437 --> 59:28.231
Sure, why not?

59:34.196 --> 59:35.781
My mom would have really liked you.

59:37.282 --> 59:40.243
You're crazy serious,
but you care about people.

59:43.038 --> 59:45.499
You would have said hello to her
if you saw her, I bet.

59:46.625 --> 59:48.460
You're just that kind of guy,
you know?

59:57.385 --> 01:00:01.723
Ned, are you gonna move on
to another case after this?

01:00:01.807 --> 01:00:03.975
'Cause I wouldn't mind
helping if you do.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:10.273
And, you know,

01:00:10.357 --> 01:00:12.150
maybe I will come for Thanksgiving too,

01:00:12.234 --> 01:00:14.653
I could change my plans
if you want me to.

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:22.118
Ned.

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:26.623
Ned?

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:11.225
- So, what is it you do, Tally?
- Yeah, what is it you do?

01:01:11.877 --> 01:01:13.670
Makes movies.
Pass the turkey, please.

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:15.672
Movies, wow.

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:18.675
Are you interested
in film school, honey?

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.053
- Um... I don't know, maybe.
- Pass the gravy, please.

01:01:22.429 --> 01:01:24.157
Well, you should go
to film school then.

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:27.821
It took me almost 30 years to go back to school
and it's been the best thing I've ever done.

01:01:28.268 --> 01:01:29.144
I don't know.

01:01:29.227 --> 01:01:32.689
There's this program out in San Francisco
I might check out.

01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:34.900
It's like this apprenticeship thing,

01:01:34.983 --> 01:01:37.360
the <i>Star Wars </i> guy created it.

01:01:37.736 --> 01:01:40.572
Luke, I am your father.

01:01:41.156 --> 01:01:44.075
It's Darth Vader. He's your father.

01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:48.121
You should look into that,
it sounds like great idea,

01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:50.373
and Tally's very talented,
isn't she, Ned?

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:52.000
Very talented.

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:53.563
- Pass the corn, please.
- See?

01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:56.421
Well, maybe I will. I don't know.

01:01:58.256 --> 01:02:01.384
- What do you do, Bob?
- Yeah, what do you do, Bob?

01:02:02.886 --> 01:02:04.012
Bob drives trucks.

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:05.931
Pass the potatoes, please.

01:02:06.014 --> 01:02:08.600
I used to drive a truck
before I got in an accident,

01:02:08.683 --> 01:02:09.809
hurt my back.

01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:11.603
Long Haul Trucking.

01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:13.605
Just me, my thoughts and the road.

01:02:14.356 --> 01:02:17.317
- It was glorious.
- It really was.

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:22.905
<i>Deer Hunter.</i>

01:02:23.657 --> 01:02:24.657
Let's do it.

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:43.385
So, what's up with you and Bob?
Been together a long time?

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:47.514
Oh, yes. Yes, very long time.

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.015
He's not Ned's dad though, right?

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:51.977
No, no, no.
That one didn't stick around.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:56.106
You love Bob, or... or just live with him?

01:02:58.900 --> 01:02:59.985
I love Bob.

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:04.072
For years,
when he was on the road,

01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:06.533
my stomach would do flips

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.451
when I heard his truck
coming up the street.

01:03:08.535 --> 01:03:09.911
Every single time.

01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:13.164
All I can say is that if...

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:16.060
men were only around
one week of the month,

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:18.164
there'd probably be a lot more
happy women out there.

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:22.549
It's just... It's hard when
you get used to it one way and then...

01:03:23.049 --> 01:03:24.968
you know,
you have to see someone every day.

01:03:25.051 --> 01:03:26.344
I see Ned every day.

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:30.140
- I know, you two are very secretive.
- Oh, it's just that I drove his work.

01:03:30.724 --> 01:03:33.226
You must be glad
he's not overseas anymore.

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:36.187
I'm sorry, what?

01:03:36.521 --> 01:03:38.815
I said it must be nice
to have him home.

01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:41.735
Oh, it is.
He's such a joy to have around.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:43.320
He's the most helpful person I know.

01:03:43.403 --> 01:03:46.031
Right? He's such a do-gooder.

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:50.910
I'm...

01:03:51.411 --> 01:03:54.706
I'm so glad you don't have a problem
with his condition.

01:03:55.915 --> 01:03:58.752
Oh, it's... it's not a big deal.
It's just...

01:03:59.753 --> 01:04:01.254
bad luck, is all.

01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:03.548
Bob fell asleep.

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:06.134
Let's go walk Waffles and find Uday.

01:04:07.052 --> 01:04:08.887
Go, that sounds like fun.

01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:10.889
Bye, sweetie.

01:04:21.441 --> 01:04:22.901
This doesn't make any sense.

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:28.114
You can't afford
to be out of work six months.

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:30.200
I told you,
it's an exchange program.

01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:33.661
I'll be working at a hospital in Harlem.
The housing is included.

01:04:34.079 --> 01:04:35.246
This is insane.

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.874
Right? It's exciting.

01:04:41.753 --> 01:04:44.631
The opportunity just presented itself,
sweetheart.

01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:48.551
I would never forgive myself
if I didn't at least try.

01:04:48.635 --> 01:04:51.930
But this is in New York City,
that's halfway across the world.

01:04:52.263 --> 01:04:54.057
Okay, now you're just being silly.

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:55.975
It's not that far on a plane.

01:04:56.601 --> 01:05:00.855
You know I don't fly,
and obviously, I can't drive.

01:05:05.777 --> 01:05:07.237
What are we gonna do for Christmas?

01:05:09.531 --> 01:05:11.199
What do you care about Christmas?

01:05:11.282 --> 01:05:12.617
Every year, we go to the casino.

01:05:13.701 --> 01:05:14.701
What about Ned?

01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:18.123
Ned can take care of himself.

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:22.335
The truth is, he's always been able
to take care of himself.

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:24.921
I have just been using him as an excuse.

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:30.093
I mean, this whole thing
was his idea, really.

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:32.220
That explains everything now.

01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:46.109
Listen to me.

01:05:49.404 --> 01:05:52.031
Why don't you wait just a little bit
'til the settlement comes in?

01:05:53.366 --> 01:05:56.077
Jerry promised me it's gonna be soon.

01:05:57.162 --> 01:05:58.955
And I'll take you on a nice cruise.

01:06:05.587 --> 01:06:06.587
No?

01:06:08.423 --> 01:06:09.466
So, that's it.

01:06:11.176 --> 01:06:14.429
- This is goodbye?
- What? It's not goodbye.

01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:18.892
Just think of it
as a new chapter in our lives.

01:06:26.608 --> 01:06:28.693
- I'm going.
- See you.

01:06:45.793 --> 01:06:47.670
Hello, Bob.

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:50.590
- How are you today?
- I think I lost your mother.

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:52.425
Did you look upstairs?

01:06:54.219 --> 01:06:58.299
- Always great talking to you, Ned.
- Hey, you know that article I was telling you about?

01:07:04.312 --> 01:07:06.648
It said that someone jumps
off the Golden Gate Bridge

01:07:06.814 --> 01:07:08.024
once every two weeks.

01:07:08.233 --> 01:07:11.027
That's 26 people a year,

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:12.862
double or triple
around the holidays.

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:16.086
Do you know how many people
you can save during the holidays alone?

01:07:16.324 --> 01:07:17.324
How many?

01:07:18.576 --> 01:07:20.370
Well, let's be conservative

01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:23.164
and say it's 30 people a year total

01:07:23.248 --> 01:07:25.041
who throw themselves
off the bridge.

01:07:25.875 --> 01:07:28.586
Let's say that
each one of those 30 people

01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:32.257
would've had two kids
if they didn't off themselves.

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:35.843
In 50 years, you'd save...

01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:39.806
You'd save 3,000 people.

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:45.478
That basically evens out 9/11 in...
in, like, a big picture way.

01:07:45.853 --> 01:07:47.146
Big picture way?

01:07:51.025 --> 01:07:52.110
Can I have that?

01:08:06.708 --> 01:08:07.708
What's this?

01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:10.086
I got it in the mail.

01:08:12.547 --> 01:08:13.673
Can I have that?

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:19.845
I was kidding. You don't have to...

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.639
Ned, no... You don't have to.

01:08:41.242 --> 01:08:44.621
- He's getting his pilot license.
- What? This is it.

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:48.625
This is it. This is...
This is exactly what they did on 9/11.

01:08:49.626 --> 01:08:51.752
Exactly what they did on 9/11.

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:58.134
<i>What is he doing now?</i>
<i>Is he smiling?</i>

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:00.845
- <i>No.</i>
<i>- What is he doing now?</i>

01:09:01.679 --> 01:09:03.238
<i>He's walking into the building.</i>

01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:05.183
<i>What is that? Is that like a...</i>

01:09:05.265 --> 01:09:07.154
<i>Where they give out</i>
<i>pilot's licenses.</i>

01:09:08.603 --> 01:09:09.604
<i>What?</i>

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:11.689
Confirmed.

01:09:12.607 --> 01:09:14.149
We fly on the 15th.

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:16.527
Praise Allah.

01:09:19.947 --> 01:09:21.073
Have you seen Ned?

01:09:22.116 --> 01:09:25.161
He went to help the Delgados.
He'll be back in a couple of minutes.

01:09:25.745 --> 01:09:27.455
Are you sad 'cause your old lady left?

01:09:30.041 --> 01:09:31.376
Told you everybody needs a ring.

01:09:31.459 --> 01:09:33.544
Right. Like you always need a ride home.

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:36.673
But Ned can't give you a ride home.

01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:40.069
But there's other things
you can get from him, right?

01:09:40.093 --> 01:09:42.595
- It's not his fault he can't drive.
- No, it's not his fault.

01:09:43.763 --> 01:09:45.683
But it's your fault
for taking advantage of that.

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:50.060
Nobody's taking advantage.
What are you talking about?

01:09:50.228 --> 01:09:52.438
Working a parking lot is classy

01:09:52.563 --> 01:09:54.816
compared to scamming a guy
with half a brain.

01:09:55.441 --> 01:09:58.528
Screw you, Bob.
He doesn't have half a brain.

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:00.279
He got injured in the war.

01:10:01.239 --> 01:10:04.075
Did you fight in any wars?
I don't see no scar on your head.

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:08.575
I fought in Vietnam, smart-ass. And he
got that scar from a paint can falling

01:10:10.373 --> 01:10:12.083
and hitting him on the head
in the garage.

01:10:12.583 --> 01:10:13.583
What?

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:16.295
- Tell me you're not serious?
- Ned's a Marine.

01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:20.633
He's a Special Operative.
A Sun Dog.

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:22.552
Yeah, he's special, all right.

01:10:23.136 --> 01:10:24.178
What about this?

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:26.931
What about it?

01:10:27.181 --> 01:10:30.393
He knows Marines. He's...
He's got credit cards.

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:32.437
I don't know anything
about him knowing Marines.

01:10:32.979 --> 01:10:34.814
But people feel sorry for him
all the time,

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:36.065
that doesn't surprise me.

01:10:37.608 --> 01:10:39.485
The hospital fucked him up
when he was born.

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:40.945
That's how he got like that.

01:10:41.446 --> 01:10:42.530
You're full of shit.

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.157
Go look in his room.

01:10:45.283 --> 01:10:48.369
Tell me if a Marine lives there.

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:03.402
<i>Why are you wearing that outfit?</i>

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:05.612
<i>Oh, I get it, you're undercover.</i>

01:11:09.974 --> 01:11:12.134
- <i>Why do you take a bus?</i>
<i>- I can't drive.</i>

01:11:12.226 --> 01:11:13.811
<i>Is that scar from the war?</i>

01:11:16.689 --> 01:11:17.982
<i>I live with my mother.</i>

01:11:18.816 --> 01:11:21.027
<i>Pretty smart</i>
<i>from an undercover standpoint.</i>

01:11:46.803 --> 01:11:48.643
<i>Are there important documents</i>
<i>in there?</i>

01:11:48.971 --> 01:11:50.389
I'm a Sun Dog now?

01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:29.512
Hey, Tally.

01:12:30.596 --> 01:12:31.681
They fly today.

01:12:32.598 --> 01:12:33.598
We should go.

01:13:04.463 --> 01:13:05.756
I haven't heard from Jenkins.

01:13:07.258 --> 01:13:08.467
We should call the police.

01:13:22.231 --> 01:13:23.232
Here we go.

01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:24.649
Here.

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:30.907
Hello, there are terrorists
at the airfield,

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:32.617
with bomb-making equipment.

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:35.286
They're Al-Qaeda
and they plan to strike today.

01:13:48.215 --> 01:13:50.718
Congratulations,
you just saved the world.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:58.434
What are they doing?

01:13:58.517 --> 01:14:00.770
They're flying model planes, Ned.

01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:05.608
You wanna know
why you don't drive, Ned?

01:14:06.817 --> 01:14:10.613
You don't drive because you rode
the short bus your entire life.

01:14:13.324 --> 01:14:15.076
Where'd this come from?

01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:17.035
eBay.

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.165
eBay?

01:14:27.546 --> 01:14:29.465
It's just a deck of cards.

01:14:34.762 --> 01:14:36.764
You wanna chase some pretend terrorists?

01:14:36.847 --> 01:14:39.308
Go! Go chase some pretend terrorists.

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:42.436
- Why are you doing this?
- 'Cause you're a retard, and...

01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:46.023
You're a virgin,
and I hate your stupid guts.

01:14:55.616 --> 01:14:57.803
Don't move. Don't move.

01:14:57.827 --> 01:14:58.911
Hands up.

01:15:02.581 --> 01:15:04.981
Watch his hands.
Look out for him move his hands.

01:15:43.664 --> 01:15:46.751
I bet this Bautista de Anza's gold
is still out there.

01:15:46.917 --> 01:15:48.419
So why don't you go get it?

01:15:49.754 --> 01:15:50.754
What?

01:15:51.172 --> 01:15:52.673
Why don't you go get it?

01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:55.634
Ned, take the head off, will you, please?

01:15:55.718 --> 01:15:57.428
It's depressing enough around here.

01:16:03.642 --> 01:16:05.102
I said, why don't you go get it?

01:16:05.186 --> 01:16:07.146
'Cause I don't exactly know where it is.

01:16:07.730 --> 01:16:09.732
I'd need a hell of a metal detector.

01:16:11.275 --> 01:16:12.318
What?

01:16:12.818 --> 01:16:14.862
I said I'd need a metal detector.

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:34.965
<i>Dear Master Sergeant Jenkins,</i>
<i>I resign.</i>

01:16:35.049 --> 01:16:36.884
<i>Sincerely, Ned Chipley.</i>

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:57.058
I'm worried about you, man.
You've been down here a week.

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.328
The holidays are brutal enough
without you going Howard Hughes on me.

01:17:35.401 --> 01:17:37.379
What do you think about
taking that thing off your head

01:17:37.403 --> 01:17:38.988
so we can have a little man to man?

01:17:55.254 --> 01:17:56.422
Okay, listen.

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:58.591
I came to apologize.

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:01.844
I didn't consider the ramifications
of any of this.

01:18:03.429 --> 01:18:06.473
I was flippant.
A man should never be flippant.

01:18:17.568 --> 01:18:21.030
You'll never be a Marine, Ned.
I shoulda told you that.

01:18:23.991 --> 01:18:27.328
You have a condition that renders you
unable to meet our standards.

01:18:29.955 --> 01:18:32.082
Those are the facts
whether we like it or not.

01:18:33.918 --> 01:18:35.419
I should've bucked up and told you

01:18:35.502 --> 01:18:38.339
just like I tell anybody else
who doesn't meet the requirements.

01:18:44.637 --> 01:18:46.805
You need a cause, son, a purpose.

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:51.101
Every man does.

01:18:52.186 --> 01:18:53.312
But this... this is not it.

01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:08.661
Can you stand and give me a salute?

01:19:28.013 --> 01:19:29.181
Merry Christmas.

01:19:38.482 --> 01:19:41.527
<i>Ned, something came</i>
<i>in the mail for you.</i>

01:19:48.534 --> 01:19:50.995
It's from your mom
and your ex-girlfriend.

01:19:56.166 --> 01:19:57.835
<i>Ned, I suck!</i>

01:19:58.419 --> 01:20:00.587
<i>Those things I said to you
are unforgivable.</i>

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:04.383
<i>I don't know what else to say
except I'll try to make it up to you.</i>

01:20:04.842 --> 01:20:05.884
<i>I promise.</i>

01:20:06.593 --> 01:20:07.886
<i>Well, I finally did it.</i>

01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:10.347
<i>I finally came to San Francisco
because of you.</i>

01:20:11.098 --> 01:20:13.600
<i>It's just as pretty
as my mom always said it was.</i>

01:20:14.268 --> 01:20:16.228
<i>If you ever come out here,
you should come visit.</i>

01:20:16.562 --> 01:20:20.524
<i>It's just a crappy dorm room,
but I got into that film camp.</i>

01:20:20.899 --> 01:20:24.236
<i>I sent them the videos from the stakeout
and they gave me a scholarship.</i>

01:20:25.195 --> 01:20:28.991
<i>Those stakeouts were
the best time I ever had.</i>

01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:31.702
<i>I hope you can forgive me, Ned.</i>

01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:33.996
<i>I don't know what
I would've done without you.</i>

01:20:34.538 --> 01:20:36.415
<i>Love, Tally.</i>

01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:40.836
<i>P.S. The bridge is amazing!</i>

01:20:43.922 --> 01:20:45.883
<i>Ned!</i>

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:50.220
eBay!

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:52.639
Come on, let's try this sucker out!

01:20:55.809 --> 01:20:58.437
<i>Well, I hear you, Ned,</i>
<i>but that's not what happened, is it?</i>

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.230
- No.
- That's right.

01:21:01.065 --> 01:21:03.025
Let me tell you
what my father used to say.

01:21:03.776 --> 01:21:05.527
My father used to say,

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:09.698
"If ifs and buts were candies and nuts,
we'd all have a hell of a Christmas.

01:21:10.074 --> 01:21:11.992
But we're not having
a hell of a Christmas."

01:21:12.576 --> 01:21:15.204
And what that means is,
things are what things are,

01:21:15.287 --> 01:21:17.748
no matter how you think
they could have been.

01:21:18.332 --> 01:21:22.127
Ned, work a little bit over here.
You're going in a goddamn circle.

01:21:22.419 --> 01:21:23.897
It would be easier during the day.

01:21:23.921 --> 01:21:26.006
Yes, it would be easier
during the day, but...

01:21:26.507 --> 01:21:28.550
Jerry told me he thinks
the company hired some guy

01:21:28.634 --> 01:21:29.802
to watch during the day.

01:21:30.552 --> 01:21:32.405
Try to get a picture of me
doing something physical,

01:21:32.429 --> 01:21:34.056
then they'll never settle the case.

01:21:35.015 --> 01:21:37.559
'Course they'll probably never
settle it anyway,

01:21:37.643 --> 01:21:39.144
on account of it's not their fault.

01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:43.315
But what the hell.
We'll get rich the old-fashioned way.

01:21:43.649 --> 01:21:46.568
Oh.

01:21:47.277 --> 01:21:48.529
- Oh.
- You got something?

01:21:49.405 --> 01:21:50.531
Here, let's switch.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:52.616
Good. Good.

01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:59.039
I gotta hand it to you, Ned,
you're a hard worker.

01:22:00.666 --> 01:22:02.668
And you know enough
to keep your mouth shut.

01:22:04.670 --> 01:22:06.547
People like to have
a guy like that around.

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:10.342
And you're an optimistic
son of a bitch.

01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:13.971
I've seen you fail at more things

01:22:14.054 --> 01:22:16.265
most people wouldn't even begin
to wanna try.

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:20.769
I don't wanna fail.

01:22:21.061 --> 01:22:24.773
Well, then you gotta stop doing things
that you're not qualified for.

01:22:25.315 --> 01:22:27.901
Shit! When I was a kid,

01:22:27.985 --> 01:22:29.653
I wanted to play for the Tigers...

01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:33.490
but I didn't have the ability
to play in the Major League.

01:22:33.574 --> 01:22:36.702
See, for me,
that was an unrealistic goal.

01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:41.874
So I had to drive a truck for a living.

01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:43.417
I was a damn good truck driver.

01:22:45.085 --> 01:22:48.839
And... that's the best you can do.

01:22:51.508 --> 01:22:54.011
- My mom says that if I...
- Ned, if you don't mind, please.

01:22:54.094 --> 01:22:55.814
I don't wanna talk about
your mom right now.

01:22:59.057 --> 01:23:00.058
Okay.

01:23:02.603 --> 01:23:03.603
Listen to me.

01:23:05.105 --> 01:23:07.505
Don't stop digging.
"Listen to me" doesn't mean stop digging.

01:23:07.733 --> 01:23:11.236
The bottom line, things aren't so bad.

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:12.738
You got your health.

01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:15.240
People seem to like you,
and what else?

01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:17.784
You got money.

01:23:18.452 --> 01:23:21.497
Two big things,
your health and money.

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:24.917
You could practically do
anything that you want,

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.505
so long as you don't keep
setting these unrealistic goals.

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:33.467
Listen, if I were you, right off the bat,

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:36.637
I would rule out anything
that required you to take a test.

01:23:38.138 --> 01:23:39.324
- Is that a car?
- Car.

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:40.516
Shit! Get down!

01:23:42.518 --> 01:23:43.602
You see it?

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:44.978
- Yeah.
- Is it gone?

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:48.565
They're gone.

01:23:49.399 --> 01:23:50.400
Good.

01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:55.364
Hey, what did that Jenkins fella say?

01:23:57.908 --> 01:23:59.326
A man needs a purpose.

01:23:59.409 --> 01:24:02.037
He's absolutely right, hundred percent.

01:24:05.832 --> 01:24:07.543
What do you wanna do with your life, Ned?

01:24:09.044 --> 01:24:10.379
What is your purpose?

01:24:12.839 --> 01:24:16.301
- I want to save lives.
- Save lives, all right.

01:24:17.928 --> 01:24:20.180
Well, for starters,
you're not gonna be a doctor, right?

01:24:20.681 --> 01:24:22.724
Rule out anything
in the medical profession.

01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:25.477
I mean, you got fired
from one hospital already.

01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:27.813
What else...

01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:31.316
Sherpa maybe? Maybe a Sherpa.

01:24:31.858 --> 01:24:36.098
I read a book about climbing Everest, and... sometimes
someone keels over and the Sherpas save their lives.

01:24:38.991 --> 01:24:41.660
'Course you might have to be an Indian
or a mountain-person

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:45.122
or whatever the hell they are.
All right, jot that down.

01:24:45.205 --> 01:24:46.665
Here, I'll hold that for you.

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:52.546
Maybe a Sherpa is not a good idea.

01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:55.591
I just can't figure out
what else fits in that category.

01:24:56.216 --> 01:24:59.344
- I could be a catcher in the rye.
- I don't what that is.

01:24:59.678 --> 01:25:02.598
I mean, I know it's a book,
but I don't know what the hell

01:25:02.681 --> 01:25:04.534
that has to do with
what we're talking about here.

01:25:04.558 --> 01:25:06.810
It's someone who catches kids
after they fall off cliffs.

01:25:06.893 --> 01:25:08.020
Okay, no!

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:11.940
See, Ned, this is an example
of where you go a little askew.

01:25:12.441 --> 01:25:14.521
You can't catch somebody
after they fall off a cliff.

01:25:14.568 --> 01:25:16.945
I mean, you can,
but that's comic book stuff,

01:25:17.029 --> 01:25:18.697
that's super hero stuff.

01:25:19.031 --> 01:25:21.783
I mean, you can prevent somebody
before they fall off a cliff,

01:25:21.867 --> 01:25:23.368
that's another thing,

01:25:23.452 --> 01:25:25.329
but once they go over,
they go over.

01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:29.166
And catching somebody
falling off a cliff is not a job.

01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:31.126
See, that's off point.

01:25:31.501 --> 01:25:33.621
That's not something
you should even be talking about.

01:25:35.631 --> 01:25:37.215
Now you got me talking about it.

01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:39.050
Here.

01:25:41.303 --> 01:25:44.181
Where the hell is this
catcher in the rye coming from?

01:25:46.683 --> 01:25:47.683
Tally.

01:25:48.727 --> 01:25:49.728
Tally.

01:25:51.563 --> 01:25:52.648
You know what, Ned?

01:25:53.607 --> 01:25:56.109
There's no easy answers to life.

01:25:57.027 --> 01:26:01.448
Most of the time, we're all just
stumbling around, you know.

01:26:02.115 --> 01:26:04.368
If you're lucky,
things just come to you.

01:26:05.202 --> 01:26:06.495
Now, in my case,

01:26:07.037 --> 01:26:09.197
I should have realized
what was going on with your mom.

01:26:09.873 --> 01:26:10.916
But I didn't.

01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:13.460
It didn't come to me.

01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:18.423
But this information
about Bautista de Anza's gold,

01:26:18.507 --> 01:26:20.258
that did come to me, so...

01:26:21.134 --> 01:26:24.680
you know,
we work with what we got.

01:26:31.436 --> 01:26:32.938
A man needs a purpose.

01:26:35.649 --> 01:26:36.817
Keep digging, Ned.

01:27:46.678 --> 01:27:47.804
I'll save you.
