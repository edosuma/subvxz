WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.737
NARRATOR: Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.771 --> 00:05.539
RICK: If there's something
to be found in the Money Pit,

00:05.573 --> 00:07.575
-we'll find it.
-KYLE: Hey, Rick.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.810
RICK:
That is interesting.

00:09.843 --> 00:11.212
CRAIG: We're trying to figure
out how old it is.

00:11.245 --> 00:13.214
Well, this is from the 1400s.

00:13.247 --> 00:15.483
-Could be a lot older.
-Wow.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.650
-(detector beeping)
-Ooh!

00:16.684 --> 00:17.651
JACK:
That's a good hit.

00:17.685 --> 00:19.720
GARY: We found something
that will blow 'em away.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.222
This is great!

00:21.255 --> 00:23.791
I have Captain James
Anderson's sea chest.

00:23.824 --> 00:26.227
Like a treasure chest?
Is this it here?

00:26.260 --> 00:28.629
-That's the baby. -Holy crap.
Look at that thing.

00:32.133 --> 00:35.103
NARRATOR: There is an island in
the North Atlantic...

00:35.136 --> 00:38.639
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.672 --> 00:41.442
for more than 200 years.

00:41.475 --> 00:45.546
So far they have found
bits of gold chain,

00:45.579 --> 00:49.183
a stone slab with strange
symbols carved into it,

00:49.217 --> 00:53.287
even a 17th century
Spanish coin.

00:53.321 --> 00:57.425
To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.827
And according to legend,

00:59.860 --> 01:03.297
one more will have to die,

01:03.331 --> 01:06.467
before the treasure
can be found.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.521
It is the beginning
of an exciting new day

01:27.555 --> 01:29.623
on Oak Island...

01:29.657 --> 01:31.625
as brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina--

01:31.659 --> 01:33.727
along with their team--

01:33.761 --> 01:37.331
are about to begin their first
big project of the summer:

01:37.365 --> 01:39.767
an extensive drilling
operation that will

01:39.800 --> 01:44.472
pinpoint the exact location
of the original Money Pit.

01:44.505 --> 01:46.507
So, you really believe
in three weeks, eh, Rick?

01:46.540 --> 01:50.344
-All will be revealed?
-I think, you know,

01:50.378 --> 01:53.481
if everything went perfect,
in 20 days we will find

01:53.514 --> 01:55.249
the one significant thing.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.218
Look, Rick, I mean you and I
disagree sometimes but

01:57.251 --> 02:00.921
I'm so on board with drilling
everything you want to drill.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.657
We're singularly focused
on the Money Pit this year.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.726
I always felt like
the Money Pit was where it began

02:05.759 --> 02:07.828
and the Money Pit is probably
where it will end.

02:09.530 --> 02:11.565
NARRATOR:
Because the exact location

02:11.599 --> 02:15.236
of the original Money Pit
shaft has been lost over time,

02:15.269 --> 02:17.705
finding it has proved
more difficult--

02:17.738 --> 02:19.540
and more expensive--

02:19.573 --> 02:23.411
than Rick and Marty Lagina
could ever have imagined.

02:23.444 --> 02:25.246
Last year, the team spent

02:25.279 --> 02:28.416
more than $2 million
excavating four

02:28.449 --> 02:30.284
40-inch-wide shafts,

02:30.318 --> 02:33.687
which, they hoped,
would narrow their search.

02:33.721 --> 02:37.291
Digging down to depths
of approximately 160 feet,

02:37.325 --> 02:40.194
they made a series of
important discoveries...

02:40.228 --> 02:44.432
particularly in the so-called
spoils excavated from

02:44.465 --> 02:48.469
their fourth and final shaft
of last summer-- GAL-1.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.904
-Ooh.
-What the heck is that?

02:50.938 --> 02:52.706
JACK:
Come on. Whoa!

02:52.740 --> 02:54.475
NARRATOR:
Last week...

02:54.508 --> 02:57.278
while resuming his search
of the GAL-1 spoils,

02:57.311 --> 02:59.880
metal detection expert,
Gary Drayton,

02:59.913 --> 03:04.685
and members of the team made
another eye-opening find.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.420
Wow.

03:06.454 --> 03:10.324
What that is, that's an old,
hand-forged nail.

03:10.358 --> 03:13.994
-This could dip into the 1600s.
-If we can verify that,

03:14.027 --> 03:15.863
I'm holding a piece of
the original Money Pit.

03:23.371 --> 03:25.706
NARRATOR: Now,
using the GAL-1 dig site

03:25.739 --> 03:28.476
as a center point
of reference...

03:28.509 --> 03:31.712
Rick, Marty and the team
are about to employ

03:31.745 --> 03:33.981
what is called
"The Geo-tech System."

03:34.014 --> 03:35.883
If successful,

03:35.916 --> 03:38.386
it will confirm the Money Pit's
exact location--

03:38.419 --> 03:40.254
once and for all.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.990
Okay. Let's put
these guys to work.

03:43.023 --> 03:44.758
-Ready to make some hole?
-Yeah.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.694
Where do you
want to start, Kyle?

03:46.727 --> 03:49.597
I think we're going to start
in here and work our way out.

03:49.630 --> 03:51.565
So, point to the first hole.

03:51.599 --> 03:52.533
Start in here.

03:59.807 --> 04:03.544
(truck beeping)

04:03.577 --> 04:06.980
NARRATOR: "The Geo-tech System"
will involve the drilling

04:07.014 --> 04:09.049
of approximately
40 six-inch wide

04:09.082 --> 04:14.021
holes in a grid pattern down
to depths of up to 200 feet.

04:14.054 --> 04:17.425
MARTY: I am a strong proponent
of the Geo-tech grid

04:17.458 --> 04:18.959
from a strategy standpoint.

04:18.992 --> 04:21.629
It's scientific,
it's methodical,

04:21.662 --> 04:23.697
uh, I am convinced it's
the right thing to do.

04:25.899 --> 04:29.370
CRAIG:
Here we go.

04:29.403 --> 04:33.374
Look, I think we've rounded to
a pretty proper grid and if--

04:33.407 --> 04:35.476
and I won't say if there's
something to be found--

04:35.509 --> 04:38.346
but when it's found,
it will be within the grid.

04:38.379 --> 04:40.348
Rick has spent a lot
of time out here already,

04:40.381 --> 04:41.949
laying out a grid

04:41.982 --> 04:44.918
that is going to make it
virtually impossible

04:44.952 --> 04:48.456
to miss the original works
there,

04:48.489 --> 04:50.324
if they still exist.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.959
We're going to drill
how many holes?

04:51.992 --> 04:55.028
-38, right now.
-Yeah, 38 holes.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.333
RICK: I think we've all rallied
around this idea

04:59.367 --> 05:01.335
that if there's something
to be found in the Money Pit,

05:01.369 --> 05:03.671
and I truly believe there is,

05:03.704 --> 05:06.407
we'll find it.

05:06.440 --> 05:08.442
NARRATOR:
During the drilling process,

05:08.476 --> 05:11.579
the team will also be
obtaining core samples.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.347
These will help them--

05:13.381 --> 05:15.349
not only in their search
for the location

05:15.383 --> 05:17.518
of the original
treasure shaft--

05:17.551 --> 05:19.820
but also locate
valuable clues--

05:19.853 --> 05:24.625
and perhaps bits of treasure
buried down below.

05:33.701 --> 05:37.137
While the Geo-tech drilling
operation gets under way...

05:37.170 --> 05:40.808
Rick, Marty and Craig Tester
make their way

05:40.841 --> 05:43.110
approximately 50 miles
northeast,

05:43.143 --> 05:48.382
to Saint Mary's University
in the city of Halifax.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.551
They have arranged
to have the iron spike

05:50.584 --> 05:54.788
found in the GAL-1 spoils
scientifically tested.

05:54.822 --> 05:56.490
If, as they hope,

05:56.524 --> 06:00.160
the spike can be dated
to before 1795--

06:00.193 --> 06:03.664
the year when the Money Pit
was first discovered--

06:03.697 --> 06:06.133
then the spike may have
been used in the Money Pit's

06:06.166 --> 06:08.702
original construction.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.139
CRAIG:
I believe this is her office.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.174
-Oh, yes. I see the lab coats.
-Yep. Hello.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.609
-Hello, Christa. Hello.
-CHRISTA: Hi.

06:15.643 --> 06:16.844
-Nice to see you again.
-How are you?

06:16.877 --> 06:18.579
-Welcome back.
-Thank you.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.180
-How are you doing?
-Hello, Christa.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.849
NARRATOR:
Dr. Christa Brosseau

06:21.882 --> 06:24.985
is an Associate Professor
of Chemistry.

06:25.018 --> 06:28.121
She is also considered to be
one of Canada's leading experts

06:28.155 --> 06:32.626
in the study of metals and
their chemical compositions.

06:32.660 --> 06:35.162
Um, and this is it here.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.064
What we're trying to do
is figure out how old it is.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.032
Okay.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.802
All right, it looks like you've
already had a section taken,

06:41.835 --> 06:42.836
-yeah? -Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.472
Okay.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.974
-So, we can sample
that section directly. -Okay.

06:47.007 --> 06:49.142
Let's go test out the spike.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.111
Let's go check it out.
Head downstairs.

06:51.144 --> 06:54.748
MARTY: Great. Okay, let's go
find out what it is.

06:54.782 --> 06:57.084
RICK: The hope, of course,
is that it dates very,

06:57.117 --> 07:01.889
very early, pre-searcher
and that with, um, certainty.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.491
That's the hope.

07:03.524 --> 07:04.892
NARRATOR:
Working with her colleague,

07:04.925 --> 07:07.595
-Dr. Sean Yang...
-Hi, Dr. Yang.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.697
...Dr. Brosseau will examine

07:09.730 --> 07:14.134
the spike using a high-powered
Scanning Electron Microscope.

07:14.167 --> 07:18.205
SEAN: So, we're going
to look at the, uh, spike.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.807
NARRATOR: The microscope
will generate images

07:19.840 --> 07:22.510
of the spike's surface

07:22.543 --> 07:25.579
that are tens of thousands
of times their actual size.

07:28.716 --> 07:30.484
RICK: Based on composition
and morphology,

07:30.518 --> 07:34.522
how definite can you date this,
to what kind of timeline?

07:34.555 --> 07:36.223
So, right,
so there's a few markers.

07:36.256 --> 07:38.125
So, in the metal itself,
one of the things

07:38.158 --> 07:41.895
we want to look for is
from the 1860s onwards,

07:41.929 --> 07:43.531
metals like nickel,

07:43.564 --> 07:46.734
molybdenum were added
into iron objects.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.869
One of the things we want
to look for is manganese,

07:48.902 --> 07:50.971
'cause it's one of the best
elemental markers.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.106
Generally if you see
between point two

07:53.140 --> 07:54.842
and one percent manganese

07:54.875 --> 07:58.245
in a steel,
then it's likely post 1840s.

07:58.278 --> 08:01.248
And, so if we see
any of those elements,

08:01.281 --> 08:02.983
then that would generally
be an indication

08:03.016 --> 08:04.918
it is a modern iron object.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.754
-Okay, well let's-let's see what
we've got here. -We'll see.

08:18.766 --> 08:23.070
-Okay. -So what we'll do
is we'll zoom in

08:23.103 --> 08:26.607
and we'll look at what
is the elemental makeup

08:26.640 --> 08:29.843
of those darker strings
that you see.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.112
So they look to be
the stringers of slag

08:32.145 --> 08:34.081
so the reason they're sort of

08:34.114 --> 08:36.016
strung out like this is
'cause they would of sort of

08:36.049 --> 08:38.752
hammered the metal to try
and get rid of that,

08:38.786 --> 08:41.288
and so they would have kind
of gotten squished.

08:41.321 --> 08:42.956
MARTY: Right, but that is one
of those dark streaks

08:42.990 --> 08:43.957
that's been magnified?

08:45.693 --> 08:46.960
Yeah, looks to be.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.136
So 90% iron,

08:56.169 --> 08:58.739
-10% carbon, that's very
typical. -FRANK: No maganese.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.741
-No manganese.
-That's good. -That's good.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.176
So, it's a pretty
good indication

09:03.210 --> 09:06.847
at this point that's
it's an early iron.

09:06.880 --> 09:11.184
I mean, if we knew
this piece was from the 1400s,

09:11.218 --> 09:13.754
would-- could you
look at it and say,

09:13.787 --> 09:16.356
-"Yes, I mean..."
-It's consistent with that.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.258
It's consistent with that.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.093
Yeah, I would say
there's nothing here

09:20.127 --> 09:22.730
that indicates it
couldn't be at least,

09:22.763 --> 09:26.934
that I see from the analysis,
that it couldn't be a lot older.

09:33.006 --> 09:36.209
CRAIG: If we knew this piece
was from the 1400s...

09:36.243 --> 09:39.312
could you look at it
and say, "Yes, I mean,

09:39.346 --> 09:41.815
-it's consistent with that."
-It's consistent with that.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.617
-Could you say that?
-Yeah,

09:43.651 --> 09:46.119
-I would say it looks to me to
be consistent with that. -Okay.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.789
There's nothing here that is
a flag for a modern iron.

09:51.191 --> 09:54.161
NARRATOR: At Saint Mary's
University in Halifax,

09:54.194 --> 09:57.130
Rick Lagina,
his brother, Marty...

09:57.164 --> 10:00.167
and their friend and business
partner, Craig Tester...

10:00.200 --> 10:04.071
have just received astounding
news concerning the metal spike

10:04.104 --> 10:07.708
they found last week
in the GAL-1 spoils.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.977
Right. And no sulfur
would indicate that your...

10:10.010 --> 10:13.847
Right, so no sulfur indicates
likely it was smelted

10:13.881 --> 10:17.685
with charcoal so that is also
an earlier time date.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.353
-Okay. -Fossil fuels became
very common in the 1700s.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.289
-It's intriguing.
-It's old.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.860
-Okay, so it's also consistent,
-Yeah.

10:26.894 --> 10:29.096
what you showed us and you're
seeing that same thing.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.032
So, we have slag.
We don't have manganese.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.934
We've got relatively pure iron.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.403
-RICK: No sulfur.
-MARTY: No sulfur.

10:36.436 --> 10:39.740
Those three things showing up
are not inconsistent,

10:39.773 --> 10:42.042
I know that's a double negative,
but are not inconsistent

10:42.075 --> 10:44.444
-with something even much older.
-In my opinion, yes.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.347
-In your opinion.
-Yeah.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.416
Well that's all good stuff,
I mean, you know,

10:49.449 --> 10:51.151
it's almost as good
as you can get.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.686
-Wow.
-So, looks good.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.255
MARTY:
The data comes back.

10:55.288 --> 10:58.826
Basically, that spike is
probably hundreds of years old.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.761
Several hundreds of years old.

11:00.794 --> 11:03.230
If it is prior to the 1600s,
then that's the thing

11:03.263 --> 11:05.132
I keep looking for.

11:05.165 --> 11:08.301
'Cause people in the island
100 years ago is one thing.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.338
People on the island
underground 100 years

11:11.371 --> 11:12.773
before the discovery of
the Money Pit

11:12.806 --> 11:15.308
is really
the definitive thing.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.476
Well, doctors,
that's excellent,

11:16.509 --> 11:18.411
that's great data,
it's intriguing,

11:18.445 --> 11:23.183
the composition of the spike.
We want to thank you very much.

11:23.216 --> 11:24.785
It's a pleasure.
Thank you.

11:24.818 --> 11:26.253
You're welcome.
Thanks for coming by.

11:36.529 --> 11:37.798
NARRATOR: After their
breakthrough trip

11:37.831 --> 11:39.967
to Saint Mary's University...

11:40.000 --> 11:41.468
Hi, how you doing?

11:41.501 --> 11:45.038
...Rick, Marty
and Charles Barkhouse

11:45.072 --> 11:46.406
return to the Money Pit

11:46.439 --> 11:48.108
to check on the progress

11:48.141 --> 11:50.343
of the Geo-tech drilling
operation.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.946
So, there's the three holes,
that's the fence that way.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.381
These are the three we've done?

11:54.414 --> 11:57.017
Yeah, yeah, here.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.486
NARRATOR: As each borehole
in the Geo-tech grid

11:59.519 --> 12:01.855
is drilled,
the cuttings--

12:01.889 --> 12:05.025
or spoils-- are carefully
searched by hand.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.127
This will allow the team

12:07.160 --> 12:09.830
to know if the holes they are
drilling are finding evidence

12:09.863 --> 12:14.534
of underground structures--
or possible treasure.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.436
Terry Matheson is
a local geologist.

12:16.469 --> 12:20.373
We hired him to do what we
would call, "mud logging."

12:20.407 --> 12:23.276
In this case,
he's gonna watch the cuttings.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.813
He's gonna describe them,
and bag them every five feet.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.882
He's gonna basically
take the geologic sciences

12:28.916 --> 12:31.919
that he is proficient in,

12:31.952 --> 12:34.855
and use them to analyze
our scientific,

12:34.888 --> 12:36.824
drilling array.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.091
NARRATOR:
Once bedrock is reached

12:38.125 --> 12:40.861
at approximately 200 feet,

12:40.894 --> 12:44.464
each Geo-tech hole is cased
with plastic piping.

12:44.497 --> 12:47.835
This is done to prevent
the holes from collapsing.

12:47.868 --> 12:51.104
It will also allow for
a metal detecting device

12:51.138 --> 12:55.809
to later scan each hole
for possible metal artifacts.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.510
Okay. Let's let them get
down hole,

12:57.544 --> 12:59.412
start collecting samples.

12:59.446 --> 13:01.281
-Yeah, yeah, I got to get
at her. -All right.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.449
Nice talking to you.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.955
NARRATOR: To help them search
the Geo-tech spoils by hand,

13:07.988 --> 13:11.058
the team from Brewster Drilling
has set up what is called,

13:11.091 --> 13:12.893
"a shaker table,"

13:12.926 --> 13:16.263
a device which literally
shakes the soil free

13:16.296 --> 13:20.901
from bits of important
evidence or artifacts.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.903
KYLE:
Hey, Rick.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.905
That's what you're getting
mixed in with the cuttings.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.506
Old and new.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.481
-That's old.
-Maybe just burnt?

13:34.514 --> 13:36.016
Almost looks like charcoal.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.318
Yeah, that's what
I was going to say.

13:44.424 --> 13:49.329
RICK:
Hey, look at that.

13:49.362 --> 13:52.132
Almost like charcoal.
That's strange.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.366
Yeah, that looks burnt.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.635
He's at 195.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.404
NARRATOR:
Charcoal?

13:57.437 --> 14:00.173
Has the team already
found important evidence

14:00.207 --> 14:02.209
of ancient man-made workings--

14:02.242 --> 14:06.546
more than 190 feet underground?

14:06.579 --> 14:09.116
Before the 19th century,

14:09.149 --> 14:12.585
miners would employ a method
known as "the chimney effect."

14:12.619 --> 14:15.388
This involved burning
wood and coal deep

14:15.422 --> 14:18.625
within the shaft in order
to force smoke up and out,

14:18.658 --> 14:22.662
and fresh air down and in.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.598
Did the Oak Island team
just discover evidence

14:25.632 --> 14:28.001
of this ancient
mining technique

14:28.035 --> 14:30.337
being used on Oak Island?

14:30.370 --> 14:34.341
Possibly in the construction
of the original Money Pit?

14:34.374 --> 14:35.675
The other possible connection

14:35.708 --> 14:38.378
is the early description
of the Money Pit,

14:38.411 --> 14:41.214
and removing the log layers
every ten feet,

14:41.248 --> 14:43.383
that several of them
had charcoal.

14:43.416 --> 14:46.586
Might that be a connection?
Perhaps.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.522
What the hell's it doing
down in bedrock?

14:49.556 --> 14:52.960
-I don't know.
-Eyes and boots.

14:52.993 --> 14:56.663
-Eyes and boots.
-Well, I'll bag it.

14:56.696 --> 14:59.066
See what the, see what the next
20 feet comes up with.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.167
Yeah, keep drilling.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.977
NARRATOR:
As far as Rick,

15:10.010 --> 15:12.312
Marty and the Oak Island team
are concerned,

15:12.345 --> 15:15.415
the Geo-tech operation
is going smoothly

15:15.448 --> 15:17.384
and according to plan.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.053
The fact that we have made
some finds and we have a much

15:20.087 --> 15:21.421
better understanding
of the underground,

15:21.454 --> 15:23.223
we will be successful.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.393
-(explosion)
-Whoa!

15:32.565 --> 15:34.034
Whoa!

15:41.574 --> 15:43.176
NARRATOR:
(explosion) .

15:45.678 --> 15:46.980
Whoa!

15:49.149 --> 15:50.150
Whoa!

15:52.419 --> 15:55.588
NARRATOR: While drilling one of
the exploratory boreholes

15:55.622 --> 15:58.091
in search of
the original Money Pit,

15:58.125 --> 16:01.061
a torrent of water has started
gushing out of nearby borehole,

16:01.094 --> 16:02.695
C-1--

16:02.729 --> 16:05.098
the same borehole
where the team found

16:05.132 --> 16:08.168
a mysterious gold-colored
object two years ago.

16:12.305 --> 16:16.076
Wow.

16:16.109 --> 16:19.379
Oh, yeah.
That's what I was afraid of.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.613
NARRATOR: Did the team
from Brewster Drilling

16:20.647 --> 16:22.549
just penetrate

16:22.582 --> 16:25.552
one of the infamous
booby-trapped flood tunnels?

16:25.585 --> 16:27.354
Or is there another--

16:27.387 --> 16:30.490
even more intriguing
explanation?

16:43.403 --> 16:45.538
All of a sudden,
we get a giant geyser

16:45.572 --> 16:49.242
from one of the wells
that we were drilling.

16:49.276 --> 16:51.044
So, the first thing
you're sure of

16:51.078 --> 16:53.513
is that we've got very
solid communication,

16:53.546 --> 16:57.084
between those two holes.
We're pumping air down one,

16:57.117 --> 16:59.452
it's coming out the other.

16:59.486 --> 17:02.222
NARRATOR: If the two holes
are communicating--

17:02.255 --> 17:05.358
or, in some way, connected--
does this mean Rick,

17:05.392 --> 17:08.761
Marty and the team have found
a natural underground link

17:08.795 --> 17:11.164
between the Money Pit and C-1?

17:28.781 --> 17:31.784
NARRATOR: Unfortunately
for the Oak Island team,

17:31.818 --> 17:33.753
the explosion of water coming
from deep

17:33.786 --> 17:37.857
within borehole C-1 means
that plans to send a diver

17:37.890 --> 17:42.329
down to the bottom of the shaft
will have to be put on hold.

17:42.362 --> 17:45.232
The churned silt and
debris could take weeks,

17:45.265 --> 17:47.234
or even months to settle--

17:47.267 --> 17:50.637
making visibility-- even
with high-tech equipment--

17:50.670 --> 17:53.473
virtually impossible.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.109
Look at, it's all communicated,

17:56.143 --> 17:58.845
I mean, we're pretty
sure of that.

17:58.878 --> 18:02.282
NARRATOR: Although the team has
suffered a temporary setback,

18:02.315 --> 18:05.152
the fact that
the Geo-tech drill hole

18:05.185 --> 18:08.755
and the C-1 shaft are
inter-linked could offer proof

18:08.788 --> 18:10.557
that a network of flood tunnels

18:10.590 --> 18:15.328
really does lie deep
beneath the surface.

18:15.362 --> 18:18.365
It's just so Oak Island.
A little piece of something.

18:18.398 --> 18:22.502
But what does it mean?
Got 55 questions.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.711
DAVE:
Doug.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.480
-Hi, Doug.
-Hey, Doug.

18:33.513 --> 18:34.881
Good to see you, everybody.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.616
NARRATOR:
Later that day...

18:36.649 --> 18:39.386
Rick, Marty, and members
of the team gather

18:39.419 --> 18:42.189
at the Mug & Anchor Pub
in the nearby town

18:42.222 --> 18:44.357
of Mahone Bay.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.925
They have been invited
by their friend,

18:45.958 --> 18:49.396
local historian, Doug Crowell--
who is eager

18:49.429 --> 18:53.166
to share what he believes is
some important information.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.335
Good to see you, Doug.
Where have you been? Been well?

18:55.368 --> 18:56.703
I've been well,
I've been well.

18:56.736 --> 18:57.904
Spending a lot of
time in the archives.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.506
What have you got for us?

18:59.539 --> 19:01.341
Well, one of the things
I was following up on

19:01.374 --> 19:03.810
over the winter was, um...

19:03.843 --> 19:06.246
your work on Lot 24

19:06.279 --> 19:08.815
and finding the coins
and various artifacts.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.750
So, I thought I'd take
a look at lot ownership

19:10.783 --> 19:12.919
and see what activity
might have preceded Sam Ball's

19:12.952 --> 19:15.755
purchase of those lots.

19:15.788 --> 19:20.193
-Holy smokes.
-Look at these.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.761
Wow. All in one spot?

19:21.794 --> 19:23.863
Yup.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.865
NARRATOR: Last year, while
searching an area of Oak Island

19:25.898 --> 19:28.501
once owned by Samuel Ball--

19:28.535 --> 19:31.338
a former 18th century
American slave--

19:31.371 --> 19:33.506
turned British loyalist...

19:33.540 --> 19:36.576
the team found a number
of British coins, buttons,

19:36.609 --> 19:37.944
and other artifacts--

19:37.977 --> 19:41.648
all dating from
the 17 and 1800s.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.484
Wow, Gary.
1700s, that changes a lot.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.985
They're not supposed to be here.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.820
There's so much stuff here,

19:47.854 --> 19:50.323
I think this is
an encampment or a camp.

19:52.725 --> 19:55.228
One of the things
I found was that Lot 26

19:55.262 --> 19:58.431
was owned by
a Captain James Anderson

19:58.465 --> 20:01.768
and this fella's history turned
out to be really interesting.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.436
He was a privateer

20:03.470 --> 20:04.904
and when the American Revolution
started,

20:04.937 --> 20:07.274
he took the patriot oath,

20:07.307 --> 20:11.378
was given command of a ship,
defected to the British,

20:11.411 --> 20:13.646
took the ship and all
and went across the lines,

20:13.680 --> 20:16.215
became a loyalist privateer.

20:18.851 --> 20:21.421
NARRATOR: Although his story
is not well known,

20:21.454 --> 20:23.890
Captain James Anderson
was believed to be

20:23.923 --> 20:26.393
from Baltimore, Maryland.

20:26.426 --> 20:27.560
According to historical
records,

20:27.594 --> 20:30.463
he was a pirate and privateer--

20:30.497 --> 20:33.866
before pledging his loyalty
to the United States

20:33.900 --> 20:38.338
during the American Revolution
in the late 1700s.

20:38.371 --> 20:41.308
But after being given
command of an American ship,

20:41.341 --> 20:43.710
he then defected
to the British--

20:43.743 --> 20:47.013
and was later charged with
high treason and piracy

20:47.046 --> 20:49.516
by then-Virginia-Governor--

20:49.549 --> 20:53.786
and future American President--
Thomas Jefferson.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.322
According to reports,

20:55.355 --> 20:58.358
Anderson soon fled
to Canada where he

20:58.391 --> 21:01.961
purchased Lot 26 on
Oak Island and lived there

21:01.994 --> 21:05.698
until 1788.

21:05.732 --> 21:09.336
He did die in the West Indies
in 1796

21:09.369 --> 21:11.304
just after the
discovery of the Money Pit.

21:11.338 --> 21:13.573
-What was he doing there?
-I suspect privateering.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.508
(all laugh)

21:15.542 --> 21:20.413
Well, what I did find out was
that there is still a descendant

21:20.447 --> 21:21.948
of his here in Nova Scotia.

21:24.951 --> 21:28.588
And he's agreed to talk
with us and tell us

21:28.621 --> 21:29.922
a little more about his family.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.524
So I thought it might
be interesting to see

21:31.558 --> 21:32.925
if there's any information

21:32.959 --> 21:35.328
in the family that might
help us on the search.

21:35.362 --> 21:37.730
-Yeah, well worth a look, yeah.
-Yeah.

21:37.764 --> 21:40.833
MARTY: The Captain Anderson
investigation is interesting

21:40.867 --> 21:42.769
because it shows,
once again,

21:42.802 --> 21:45.572
the colorful history
of this bloody little island.

21:45.605 --> 21:48.341
If we can get something
from his descendants,

21:48.375 --> 21:50.910
more about this fellow,
it could be a clue.

21:50.943 --> 21:52.412
If Oak Island
tells you anything,

21:52.445 --> 21:54.947
this island is all
about the "what ifs"

21:54.981 --> 21:59.018
and the possibilities.
You have to follow every lead.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.787
I think we should run it down.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.555
-Alex?
-Sure.

22:02.589 --> 22:06.593
Look, the information hunt
to me has always been the most

22:06.626 --> 22:08.461
intriguing part of this and you
know,

22:08.495 --> 22:11.464
the young minds should go
as far as I'm concerned.

22:11.498 --> 22:14.000
You know, you guys
can puzzle it out.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.869
Look, I know one thing,
he's not going.

22:16.903 --> 22:18.971
(all laugh)

22:19.005 --> 22:22.141
I mean, you, you'd fall
asleep in five minutes, so...

22:22.174 --> 22:25.378
This is every bit an information
hunt as much as treasure hunt

22:25.412 --> 22:28.381
and I find it fascinating,
absolutely fascinating.

22:28.415 --> 22:29.549
We'll see where it goes.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.719
DAVE:
Let's go 60, 40, Rick.

22:32.752 --> 22:36.122
60 on the treasure,
40 on the (bleep).

22:36.155 --> 22:39.025
(all laugh)

22:39.058 --> 22:40.560
To success.

22:40.593 --> 22:42.929
-To the hunt.
-ALL: Cheers.

22:45.498 --> 22:47.534
NARRATOR:
Did Captain James Anderson

22:47.567 --> 22:50.437
bury a portion of his
treasure on Oak Island--

22:50.470 --> 22:52.905
more than 200 years ago?

22:52.939 --> 22:55.007
And could finding
evidence of it

22:55.041 --> 22:59.011
really be the key to solving
the Oak Island mystery?

22:59.045 --> 23:01.414
MARTY: All right, then,
more work to do.

23:01.448 --> 23:05.552
NARRATOR:
Coming up...

23:05.585 --> 23:07.620
NARRATOR:
As a new day begins...

23:07.654 --> 23:10.757
and as Rick Lagina
and Dave Blankenship

23:10.790 --> 23:12.559
continue to oversee the
Geo-tech drilling operation

23:12.592 --> 23:16.095
in the Money Pit area
on Oak Island...

23:21.133 --> 23:24.437
...Alex Lagina,
Peter Fornetti,

23:24.471 --> 23:26.038
and Charles Barkhouse--

23:26.072 --> 23:28.841
along with researcher
Doug Crowell...

23:28.875 --> 23:32.178
travel some 50 miles north
to the city of Wolfville,

23:32.211 --> 23:34.981
Nova Scotia.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.916
They are on their way
to meet a descendant

23:36.949 --> 23:39.619
of Captain James Anderson--

23:39.652 --> 23:42.622
the 18th century pirate
who once owned property

23:42.655 --> 23:44.624
on Oak Island.

23:44.657 --> 23:46.759
I mean, the main thing that
sticks out to me is the fact

23:46.793 --> 23:48.094
that he's on the island prior
to the discovery

23:48.127 --> 23:50.096
of the Money Pit.

23:50.129 --> 23:53.099
So, you know, what's the odds
that this guy was involved in

23:53.132 --> 23:55.067
the actual placing
the treasure there?

23:55.101 --> 23:56.736
Or, if he got word

23:56.769 --> 23:58.170
of the treasure being there and
was looking.

23:58.204 --> 23:59.772
-Or that he knows something,
yeah. -Mm-hmm.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.474
It's kind of an
intriguing thought.

24:01.508 --> 24:03.643
I'm hoping we're going
to get some information

24:03.676 --> 24:07.146
that maybe will be of some use
to us on the hunt.

24:07.179 --> 24:09.516
One of the things we know
about Captain Anderson is

24:09.549 --> 24:12.885
that he was a privateer.
He was active in the area.

24:12.919 --> 24:15.488
So, what we're hoping for
is any evidence of actual

24:15.522 --> 24:17.824
treasure on Oak Island.

24:17.857 --> 24:20.627
(doorbell rings)

24:22.028 --> 24:23.162
Good day, sir.

24:23.195 --> 24:24.564
-Hello.
-How ya doin?

24:24.597 --> 24:25.832
-Hey, you Steve?
-Yes.

24:25.865 --> 24:27.233
-Doug Crowell.
-Nice to meet you, Doug.

24:27.266 --> 24:29.068
-Steve, thanks for taking
the time. -No problem.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.803
You guys want to come
in for a chat and sit?

24:30.837 --> 24:32.004
-Absolutely.
-That'd be great. -Come on in.

24:32.038 --> 24:33.540
Thanks, Doug.

24:36.142 --> 24:39.746
-Take a seat there,
anywhere you want to. -Okay.

24:39.779 --> 24:40.980
Thank you.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.588
Well, Steve, what brought us
to look you up was:

24:48.621 --> 24:51.924
-Lot 26 was owned by
James Anderson. -Correct.

24:51.958 --> 24:54.561
And according to this
record here, it was sold

24:54.594 --> 24:57.296
-to Samuel Ball in 1788.
-Mm-hmm.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.131
And what we're hoping
to do is learn a little bit more

24:59.165 --> 25:01.568
about the background
of James Anderson.

25:01.601 --> 25:02.969
And there's always
been a question

25:03.002 --> 25:05.304
of how Samuel Ball
came to the area.

25:05.337 --> 25:08.808
-Yeah. -I wonder if he knew
James Anderson a long time ago?

25:08.841 --> 25:11.077
Could he possibly have
sailed with him at one time?

25:11.110 --> 25:15.548
And maybe some secrets
spilled out?

25:15.582 --> 25:19.986
NARRATOR: Born into slavery
in South Carolina in 1765,

25:20.019 --> 25:23.255
Samuel Ball won his freedom
by fighting for the British

25:23.289 --> 25:26.626
during the American Revolution.

25:26.659 --> 25:29.061
After the war, he fled
to Canada where--

25:29.095 --> 25:33.700
in 1786-- he was reported
to be living on Oak Island

25:33.733 --> 25:36.168
as a simple cabbage farmer.

25:36.202 --> 25:40.139
But, by the time of
his death in 1846--

25:40.172 --> 25:44.076
Samuel Ball had mysteriously--
and inexplicably--

25:44.110 --> 25:47.880
become one of the wealthiest
men in Nova Scotia.

25:47.914 --> 25:50.349
Could he--
as many suspect--

25:50.382 --> 25:53.019
have found a portion of
the Oak Island treasure?

25:53.052 --> 25:54.987
And, if so,

25:55.021 --> 25:57.089
could the treasure have
originally been buried there--

25:57.123 --> 25:59.258
by Captain James Anderson?

26:01.227 --> 26:03.195
DOUG:
Samuel Ball bought Lot 25

26:03.229 --> 26:07.166
the year before he bought
Lot 26 from James Anderson.

26:07.199 --> 26:08.968
So we're hoping you can
fill us in

26:09.001 --> 26:10.336
a little bit more
on the history.

26:10.369 --> 26:15.775
-Okay. Well...
-Thanks.

26:15.808 --> 26:17.744
He was a mariner.

26:17.777 --> 26:22.314
And he was both pirate and spy.

26:22.348 --> 26:25.051
And he had a ship
that was called The Betsy.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.986
And there is record

26:27.019 --> 26:30.322
of him sailing the waters,
I think in 1768.

26:30.356 --> 26:32.725
So, that puts it back
a bit before 1788.

26:32.759 --> 26:36.763
So, he's been around for
a while in the waters, right?

26:36.796 --> 26:38.364
-Was quite a character.
-Yeah,

26:38.397 --> 26:41.367
that's a very good way to
describe him, yeah.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.169
I can show you guys more things.

26:43.202 --> 26:45.137
I have Captain James Anderson's
sea chest.

26:47.206 --> 26:49.008
Sea chest?
Like a treasure chest?

26:49.041 --> 26:50.743
Yeah, just like
a treasure chest.

26:50.777 --> 26:53.913
We would love to see that.
That would be a first for us.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.281
NARRATOR:
A treasure chest?

26:55.314 --> 26:56.749
Yeah, we'll give you a hand
with that.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.818
All right. Thank you.

26:58.851 --> 27:01.087
NARRATOR: One that belonged
to an 18th century privateer--

27:01.120 --> 27:03.823
who once owned property
on Oak Island?

27:03.856 --> 27:05.858
Just through here
in the next room.

27:05.892 --> 27:09.295
-Is this it here?
-That's the baby. -Wow!

27:09.328 --> 27:11.097
Holy crap!
Look at that thing.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.370
DOUG:
Oh, look at this.
NARRATOR:
Coming up...

27:18.404 --> 27:19.672
-Wow.
-What do you think, guys?

27:19.706 --> 27:21.173
Yeah. Check this thing out.

27:21.207 --> 27:22.574
NARRATOR:
Alex Lagina

27:22.608 --> 27:26.212
and members of the Oak Island
team are visiting the home

27:26.245 --> 27:28.014
of Steve Atkinson--

27:28.047 --> 27:30.917
a direct descendant of
the 18th century pirate,

27:30.950 --> 27:32.919
Captain James Anderson...

27:32.952 --> 27:35.087
Okay. Who wants to do
the honors of opening it?

27:35.121 --> 27:36.889
-Alex?
-Sure. Yeah, love to.

27:36.923 --> 27:38.825
-Here you go.
-Okay.

27:38.858 --> 27:41.694
NARRATOR: They have just been
shown an incredible artifact:

27:41.728 --> 27:44.130
a wooden chest once
owned by Captain Anderson,

27:44.163 --> 27:46.766
and that has been passed down

27:46.799 --> 27:49.368
though the Atkinson family
for generations.

27:49.401 --> 27:51.103
This is so cool.
(chuckles)

27:55.374 --> 27:58.878
-I think this is it. I feel
something happening. -Wow.

28:00.512 --> 28:05.251
-Wow. -Now, in this chest
right here...

28:05.284 --> 28:07.186
Mm-hmm?

28:07.219 --> 28:09.221
You'll find some documents
you're gonna like.

28:09.255 --> 28:11.323
ALEX: We open up the chest
and we see a couple of older,

28:11.357 --> 28:15.294
smaller chests inside and
a bunch of old documents.

28:15.327 --> 28:17.096
So, I'm pretty excited by that.

28:17.129 --> 28:20.266
STEVE: The papers are
extremely delicate.

28:20.299 --> 28:24.003
-Died, July 1796.
-Exactly.

28:24.036 --> 28:28.007
-One year after the discovery
of the Money Pit. -Mm-hmm.

28:28.040 --> 28:30.142
Here we go.

28:30.176 --> 28:33.746
"To all whom it may concern,
we do hereby certify

28:33.780 --> 28:38.517
"that brother James Anderson is
a registered master Mason

28:38.550 --> 28:41.453
in the Lodge number nine."

28:41.487 --> 28:43.522
-Master Mason.
-That's right.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.058
"Given under our hand
and seal of our lodge

28:46.092 --> 28:49.528
this 24th of June 1791."

28:49.561 --> 28:52.364
-Definitely a Mason.
-Definitely a Mason, yeah.

28:52.398 --> 28:55.267
NARRATOR:
Captain James Anderson...

28:55.301 --> 28:58.971
a Mason? A member of a society
of master builders--

28:59.005 --> 29:01.974
living on Oak Island
during the years

29:02.008 --> 29:07.146
before the Money Pit was
first discovered in 1795?

29:07.179 --> 29:12.118
With ancient ties to everything
from the Knights Templar...

29:12.151 --> 29:14.420
to the Illuminati, Masons--

29:14.453 --> 29:17.223
also known as Freemasons--

29:17.256 --> 29:21.994
enjoy a unique status
in the history of Oak Island.

29:22.028 --> 29:23.963
Prominent treasure hunters,
Frederick Blair

29:23.996 --> 29:26.966
and M.R. Chappell
were members--

29:26.999 --> 29:31.203
as was future U.S. President,
Franklin D. Roosevelt.

29:31.237 --> 29:34.273
One of the symbols
of Freemasonry

29:34.306 --> 29:37.176
is the letter "G,"
which is usually depicted

29:37.209 --> 29:40.046
in the center of a triangle--

29:40.079 --> 29:43.549
and both the letter "G" and the
triangle have been found carved

29:43.582 --> 29:47.353
on numerous objects both
in and around Oak Island.

29:49.288 --> 29:52.358
That's quite
an amazing document.

29:52.391 --> 29:56.095
Now, this one's a little bit
better penmanship, I think,

29:56.128 --> 29:58.364
for us to read.
And it's pretty cool.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.402
Lay that one out there
and see if you can...

30:03.435 --> 30:05.437
This says,
"In consideration of

30:05.471 --> 30:08.540
"the sum of 67 pounds,
17 shillings sterling

30:08.574 --> 30:10.576
"paid me by James Anderson.

30:10.609 --> 30:12.378
"The said sum being the
amount of a bottomry

30:12.411 --> 30:14.346
bond on the schooner Betsy."

30:14.380 --> 30:16.615
So, is this the purchase,
for lack of a better word,

30:16.648 --> 30:18.184
-of The Betsy?
-The Betsy, I would say.

30:18.217 --> 30:20.853
In 1778, it was purchased
by James Anderson

30:20.887 --> 30:23.022
-and presumably then taken here.
-Yeah.

30:23.055 --> 30:25.357
Was the Betsy,
was that his privateer ship?

30:25.391 --> 30:29.495
-I do believe so.
-Amazing.

30:29.528 --> 30:32.364
NARRATOR:
Did Captain James Anderson--

30:32.398 --> 30:34.934
a privateer
and pirate operating

30:34.967 --> 30:37.169
in the waters off Nova Scotia--

30:37.203 --> 30:41.240
bring his ship,
The Betsy to Oak Island?

30:41.273 --> 30:42.975
I found something!

30:43.009 --> 30:45.644
NARRATOR: And, if so,
could this be the source

30:45.677 --> 30:47.880
of the evidence of
an ancient ship--

30:47.914 --> 30:50.549
recently found at the bottom
of the Oak Island swamp?

30:50.582 --> 30:55.087
It may be a ship's plank.

30:55.121 --> 30:58.390
Now, all those keys
he has in his hand.

30:58.424 --> 31:00.292
-Can I see them for a sec?
-Sure.

31:00.326 --> 31:03.562
That one opens
that treasure chest.

31:03.595 --> 31:05.231
Maybe some other ones, could
be...

31:05.264 --> 31:06.999
I couldn't help
noticing there are four keys.

31:07.033 --> 31:08.901
Could there have been more
treasure chests on the island?

31:08.935 --> 31:11.270
That's what I wonder.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.172
NARRATOR:
Could the three keys be,

31:13.205 --> 31:17.009
in some way, connected
to the three treasure chests--

31:17.043 --> 31:20.012
which were reportedly
found by Daniel McGinnis

31:20.046 --> 31:21.413
and his two friends
while digging

31:21.447 --> 31:24.116
in the original Money Pit?

31:24.150 --> 31:28.354
Grandpa Daniel, he and his two
friends started digging.

31:28.387 --> 31:34.126
Now, I've been told they
found three treasure chests.

31:34.160 --> 31:37.696
And what is in this box
is one of the things

31:37.729 --> 31:40.432
-that came from that chest.
-Wow.

31:45.137 --> 31:46.538
Thanks so much for letting us
take a look at this.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.374
I mean, this...

31:48.407 --> 31:50.309
Honestly, it's like nothing
we've seen before. So...

31:50.342 --> 31:52.644
You've shown us some great
information right here.

31:52.678 --> 31:55.614
-So, thank you.
-Oh, you're very welcome, guys.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.155
NARRATOR:
The next morning...

32:03.189 --> 32:06.325
as the Geo-tech operation
continues at the Money Pit...

32:06.358 --> 32:09.428
metal detection
expert Gary Drayton--

32:09.461 --> 32:12.431
along with Peter Fornetti
and Jack Begley...

32:12.464 --> 32:14.967
begin searching for new clues

32:15.001 --> 32:16.368
at the area known
as Isaac's Point--

32:16.402 --> 32:20.172
located on the eastern
side of the island.

32:20.206 --> 32:25.011
I fancy going out to the point
and doing around the bluffs.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.179
They've had a couple
of big storms here.

32:27.213 --> 32:29.248
There might be some erosion
down that side.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.183
And it might have
pulled stuff away?

32:31.217 --> 32:33.252
Yeah. That's what I'm hoping
for.

32:33.285 --> 32:36.322
-Got you. All right.
-Yeah, let's go.

32:36.355 --> 32:38.490
GARY: One of the first things
I was told

32:38.524 --> 32:40.026
when I walked
onto the island,

32:40.059 --> 32:43.162
was that there'd been
a couple of bad storms,

32:43.195 --> 32:45.531
and there'd been
some beach erosion.

32:45.564 --> 32:47.533
That makes your toes tingle
because

32:47.566 --> 32:50.336
when the banks are eroded,

32:50.369 --> 32:55.341
anything that was in those
banks is now on the beach.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.543
Look at this erosion.
That tree is hanging out.

32:57.576 --> 33:01.113
Let me have a little scan
along this bank.

33:01.147 --> 33:03.749
-This is sweet.
-Careful.

33:11.390 --> 33:12.724
(detector beeping)

33:12.758 --> 33:15.327
Ooh!

33:15.361 --> 33:16.428
(detector beeping)

33:16.462 --> 33:18.664
It says, "six inches."

33:18.697 --> 33:20.666
Oh, that looks
like a good hit, too.

33:20.699 --> 33:24.036
-Yeah, it's like a...
-Bronze, something like that?

33:24.070 --> 33:25.771
I'm not sure what it is.

33:25.804 --> 33:29.341
It's tough because
my coil's on an angle.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.343
So, it's somewhere in there.

33:31.377 --> 33:35.214
PETER: Nothing like digging
higher than you.

33:38.150 --> 33:41.720
GARY: Should we pinpoint?
See if it's out?

33:46.792 --> 33:48.627
Yeah, seems like it's out.

33:48.660 --> 33:50.662
(detector beeping)

33:52.864 --> 33:55.534
Yeah, it's somewhere here.

33:59.171 --> 34:00.206
Oh, a musket ball!

34:00.239 --> 34:02.208
That's cool.

34:02.241 --> 34:04.076
That's still old.
Let's have a look.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.713
Good find.

34:07.746 --> 34:09.715
NARRATOR:
A musket ball?

34:09.748 --> 34:12.784
Over the years it has
been well documented

34:12.818 --> 34:15.321
that the islands of Mahone Bay,

34:15.354 --> 34:18.090
in Nova Scotia were considered
strategic outposts

34:18.124 --> 34:20.492
for the British military
during the American War

34:20.526 --> 34:23.695
for independence.

34:23.729 --> 34:27.099
Last year,
while searching Lot 24,

34:27.133 --> 34:29.135
on the western side
of the island,

34:29.168 --> 34:32.804
Gary Drayton found a number
of coins and other artifacts

34:32.838 --> 34:35.774
that suggested Oak Island
had once been the site

34:35.807 --> 34:38.177
of a military encampment.

34:38.210 --> 34:43.182
This is an ingot, a lead ingot
for making musket balls.

34:43.215 --> 34:46.718
Well, that's-that's cool,
I mean, this is, you know,

34:46.752 --> 34:49.488
-pre-1850s.
-Yeah. Great.

34:49.521 --> 34:50.889
It's old, that's for sure.

34:50.922 --> 34:53.225
And it goes in
the good finds pouch.

34:53.259 --> 34:54.760
I always like finding
a musket ball.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.695
But this is sweet,

34:56.728 --> 34:59.665
if we can find one thing,
we should be able to find more.

34:59.698 --> 35:02.868
I mean, I hate to say it,
but, you know,

35:02.901 --> 35:04.570
the more erosion, the better.

35:10.642 --> 35:14.180
-(detector beeping)
-I'm getting a signal here.

35:14.213 --> 35:20.186
Nah, it's jumpy.
But, it's hard to tell.

35:20.219 --> 35:22.188
Once you start putting
these search coils at an angle,

35:22.221 --> 35:26.825
you know, it's--
you get wonky readings.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.336
-Depth check.
-All right.

35:37.369 --> 35:40.772
-See if I was in the right area.
-Let me have a pinpoint.

35:40.806 --> 35:45.577
Might be out,
it just might be surface junk.

35:45.611 --> 35:47.646
-I hope not.
-Me, too.

35:47.679 --> 35:49.915
Might have fallen, yeah.

35:49.948 --> 35:52.651
(detector beeping)

35:57.956 --> 36:01.159
Don't keep us in suspense.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.398
Oh, it's part of a coin!

36:11.637 --> 36:12.671
GARY:
Wow...

36:12.704 --> 36:14.306
That's a cut coin.

36:14.340 --> 36:17.343
I bet you this is
a cut Maravedi.

36:17.376 --> 36:19.278
Oh, this is great!

36:19.311 --> 36:21.980
NARRATOR: On the eastern point
of Oak Island...

36:22.013 --> 36:24.783
metal detection expert,
Gary Drayton,

36:24.816 --> 36:28.787
has just made a potentially
important discovery.

36:28.820 --> 36:31.757
You see the angle
on both sides here?

36:31.790 --> 36:34.726
-That was cut on purpose.
-For making change, right?

36:34.760 --> 36:35.961
Yeah, making change.

36:40.299 --> 36:43.302
NARRATOR: Often deemed "The
First Coins of the New World,"

36:43.335 --> 36:46.672
the Maravedi was
a Spanish-made copper coin

36:46.705 --> 36:49.375
that was primarily used
by explorers

36:49.408 --> 36:53.712
who came to the Americas during
the 17th and 18th centuries.

36:53.745 --> 36:56.648
They were also often
used by pirates

36:56.682 --> 36:59.518
of various nationalities
as payment for crewmembers--

36:59.551 --> 37:01.853
and were commonly
cut into pieces

37:01.887 --> 37:04.390
when it was necessary
to make change

37:04.423 --> 37:07.859
or make an advance
on a purchase.

37:07.893 --> 37:11.797
It was a 17th century Spanish
Maravedi

37:11.830 --> 37:13.999
that was found
in the Oak Island swamp

37:14.032 --> 37:15.567
nearly four years ago.

37:17.803 --> 37:22.474
Could finding another one add
even more fuel to the notion

37:22.508 --> 37:25.677
that pirates had frequented
the island more than a century

37:25.711 --> 37:28.013
before it was used
as a campsite

37:28.046 --> 37:30.749
by the British military?

37:30.782 --> 37:34.420
-Definitely have to
have this cleaned up. -Yeah.

37:34.453 --> 37:36.855
-You think we should call
my uncles? -Yeah, for sure.

37:36.888 --> 37:38.990
-Yeah? -Yeah. We've actually
found something

37:39.024 --> 37:41.793
that will blow them away.

37:41.827 --> 37:44.062
-Hello?
-Hello, Rick.

37:44.095 --> 37:47.866
-Yeah, Gary.
-We have got some good news.

37:47.899 --> 37:50.369
JACK: Of the surface
finds we've had,

37:50.402 --> 37:54.039
the Maravedis have proven to be
the oldest coins we've found,

37:54.072 --> 37:57.543
and they're the best information
that someone was here,

37:57.576 --> 38:00.078
back in the mid-to-late 1600s.

38:00.111 --> 38:04.383
You're gonna love this, Rick.

38:04.416 --> 38:05.884
All right. What you got?

38:05.917 --> 38:07.919
Well, you're always
telling me to find stuff...

38:07.953 --> 38:10.021
-Yes.
-This time we found stuff.

38:10.055 --> 38:12.791
-What do you got?
-What we got, we got a,

38:12.824 --> 38:15.927
an interesting musket ball
to start with.

38:15.961 --> 38:19.064
-Yeah. -So someone was up here
with a musket,

38:19.097 --> 38:22.601
ball got stuck in
the musket barrel,

38:22.634 --> 38:25.371
pulled it out
and just dropped it.

38:25.404 --> 38:26.938
This is great, Gary,
but there's no,

38:26.972 --> 38:28.607
-no way to date this, right?
-No, it's...

38:28.640 --> 38:30.108
That's what we're looking for,
man.

38:30.141 --> 38:32.110
Yeah, we're looking for
something with a date on it.

38:32.143 --> 38:35.013
-Um...
-Let's see.

38:35.046 --> 38:38.049
This didn't even make the pouch.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.918
This is a top pocket find.

38:46.625 --> 38:49.027
And you think that is...

38:49.060 --> 38:52.631
That is a cut Maravedi.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.000
-And that's an oldie.
-Yeah.

38:57.503 --> 38:59.505
Wait, when you say "old,"
what do you mean?

38:59.538 --> 39:03.375
I got no doubt that's... 1700s,

39:03.409 --> 39:05.977
you might even be in the 16's.

39:06.011 --> 39:08.113
And look at the way
it's been cut;

39:08.146 --> 39:10.148
you can see it's been
basically chiseled off.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.451
Yeah, yeah. It looks like it
was done intentionally,

39:12.484 --> 39:14.586
that's for sure.
I agree with you,

39:14.620 --> 39:15.721
that isn't worn away.
That's cut.

39:15.754 --> 39:17.055
GARY:
Yeah.

39:17.088 --> 39:18.557
We need to do some
research on that,

39:18.590 --> 39:21.126
-when they quit cutting coins.
-Yeah.

39:21.159 --> 39:23.529
And the reason why this
is in such good condition,

39:23.562 --> 39:25.764
is because it was in the soil,

39:25.797 --> 39:28.634
it's had no contact
with saltwater.

39:28.667 --> 39:30.402
We might get lucky.

39:30.436 --> 39:32.003
This might be the part
with the date on it.

39:32.037 --> 39:33.672
-With the date on it.
-Yeah.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.441
Gold would be great,
and it's always exciting,

39:35.474 --> 39:37.876
but the date
is super significant.

39:37.909 --> 39:41.713
Oh, yeah.
No doubt this is old.

39:41.747 --> 39:45.851
I mean, there was
these Maravedis were copper,

39:45.884 --> 39:50.188
-and then you had silver reales
and then gold escudos. -Right.

39:50.221 --> 39:54.793
-So maybe we're working
our way up slowly. -Yeah.

39:54.826 --> 39:57.963
Gary being turned loose
and finding stuff right away,

39:57.996 --> 40:01.533
underscores the importance of
doing this metal detecting.

40:01.567 --> 40:04.069
If he can go out there and find
this stuff reasonably quickly,

40:04.102 --> 40:06.505
then there's probably
a lot of it.

40:06.538 --> 40:07.973
RICK: We got to get that
cleaned and tested.

40:08.006 --> 40:09.841
MARTY:
Yup.

40:09.875 --> 40:12.544
That's fantastic,
but still no gold dance, eh?

40:12.578 --> 40:15.013
No, no gold dance,
but that had me wiggling.

40:15.046 --> 40:17.449
(all laugh)

40:17.483 --> 40:19.685
-All right, good. Keep going.
-Oh, yeah.

40:19.718 --> 40:20.819
We've only just begun.

40:20.852 --> 40:23.589
Yeah, Gary, all right!

40:23.622 --> 40:26.224
NARRATOR: For brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina,

40:26.257 --> 40:29.461
the discovery of yet
another Spanish coin

40:29.495 --> 40:31.497
gives hope
that the many stories

40:31.530 --> 40:34.132
and legends of pirates
coming to Oak Island--

40:34.165 --> 40:36.234
and burying a vast
treasure here--

40:36.267 --> 40:40.539
could very well be true.

40:40.572 --> 40:42.107
Although their current season
on the island

40:42.140 --> 40:44.242
has only just begun,

40:44.275 --> 40:47.613
they are encouraged by the many
discoveries they and members

40:47.646 --> 40:51.517
of their team have made
so far this year:

40:51.550 --> 40:54.820
-A rose head spike...
-That is sweet.

40:54.853 --> 40:57.923
-A pirate chest...
-Oh, look at this. -Wow.

40:57.956 --> 41:01.893
NARRATOR: And now,
another Spanish coin...

41:01.927 --> 41:04.195
But as their Geo-tech search

41:04.229 --> 41:07.699
for the elusive Oak Island
Money Pit continues...

41:07.733 --> 41:12.103
an even more important
mystery lies before them.

41:12.137 --> 41:15.106
What if they find
what they're looking for?

41:15.140 --> 41:17.108
What then?

41:17.142 --> 41:20.078
Will it be everything
they hoped it would be?

41:20.111 --> 41:24.583
Or will it be something
so fearful--

41:24.616 --> 41:26.552
so disturbing--

41:26.585 --> 41:29.154
that it would have been best
to let it lie buried...

41:29.187 --> 41:31.957
deep beneath the ground?

41:34.993 --> 41:37.863
NARRATOR: Next time
on The Curse of Oak Island...

41:37.896 --> 41:39.531
It's a coin!

41:39.565 --> 41:41.867
-MARTY: Holy smokes.
-GARY: 1600s.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.902
-This is really cool.
-I've never seen you so excited.

41:43.935 --> 41:45.604
It means something!

41:45.637 --> 41:47.873
Here's hard evidence
people were on this island

41:47.906 --> 41:51.677
120 years before the discovery
of the Money Pit.

41:52.711 --> 41:54.245
The drill bar is stuck.

41:57.816 --> 41:59.117
We've hit an obstruction.

41:59.150 --> 42:00.085
MARTY:
This is so serious.

42:00.118 --> 42:01.587
This is the first step

42:01.620 --> 42:02.821
to shutting down
the whole island.
