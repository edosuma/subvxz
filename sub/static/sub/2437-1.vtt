<i>Trying to find a phone

17:29.207 --> 17:30.543
<i>I have not made the pickup.</i>

17:30.641 --> 17:32.234
We got a problem.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.320
Can you talk?

17:34.437 --> 17:37.782
- No. You see our man?
- No, 'cause there was no man.

<i>Gags took a walk
through his 12th-story window.</i>

17:41.361 --> 17:43.534

17:45.156 --> 17:46.829
<i>What do you want to do?</i>

17:46.949 --> 17:48.576
Did he down our merch?

17:48.743 --> 17:51.337
Is he gone? Did he carry
the cash on him? What?

17:51.454 --> 17:53.456
I'm talking
to somebody's somebody.

17:53.581 --> 17:55.208
I will know in 25 minutes.

Get the work car and meet me
at Armitage and Lincoln.

17:59.337 --> 18:01.260
Jimmy, here, here.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.817
On the side,
Gags was laying down juice loans...

18:12.934 --> 18:14.902
on the street
for this Attaglia, right?

18:15.019 --> 18:16.771
He was turning in
the vig money...

18:16.938 --> 18:19.236
but he was putting
in his pocket the principal.

18:19.357 --> 18:22.531
They found out
he was screwing 'em over.

18:22.652 --> 18:24.780
They went crazy.
Ba-boom.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.623
- Gags down our merch?
- Yeah. At the R.D. Lounge.

18:27.740 --> 18:29.492
Pauli saw it go down.

18:29.617 --> 18:32.962
It was your money in Gags' pocket
when he went out the window.

18:39.961 --> 18:41.759
You keep this runnin'.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.654
<i>Can I help you?</i>

18:57.770 --> 18:59.898
Yes, please.
I'd like to see a Mr....

19:00.022 --> 19:02.400
<i>- I want a cup too.
- Sure. Where's your cup?</i>

19:02.525 --> 19:05.153
<i>Back by the machine.
I'm sorry. What were you saying?</i>

19:05.278 --> 19:07.872
Yes. Mr. Attaglia.
I'd like to see him.

19:07.989 --> 19:11.368
You've made a delivery of some plating,
and I had problems with it.

19:11.492 --> 19:12.789
<i>Just a minute.</i>

19:12.910 --> 19:15.959
<i>There's someone to see you
about some plating.</i>

19:16.080 --> 19:17.673
<i>Okay.</i>

19:19.500 --> 19:21.502

- Thank you.

19:38.769 --> 19:41.113
I'm Mr. Attaglia.

19:41.230 --> 19:43.653
You didn't get a delivery
or somethin'? Sit down.

19:43.774 --> 19:45.367
Zinc? What?

19:46.444 --> 19:48.287
My name is Frank...

19:48.404 --> 19:50.406
and that was bullshit.

19:53.326 --> 19:57.376
- What is this?
- "This" is Joe Gags.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.795
185,000 of my money.

19:59.916 --> 20:01.668
We have this problem.

20:01.792 --> 20:04.170
<i>What problem?
What are you talkin' about?</i>

20:05.588 --> 20:07.966
He was moving
my merchandise...

20:08.090 --> 20:12.061
so the money in his pocket when
he went out the window is my money.

20:12.178 --> 20:14.806
This is a plating company.
What are you telling me this shit?

20:14.931 --> 20:17.480
"Shit"?
I want my money.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.773
Hey, I don't know
what you're talkin' about...

20:19.894 --> 20:23.774
Mr. Frank La La... whatever.

20:23.898 --> 20:27.072
- Some guy die?
- Yes.

20:28.402 --> 20:31.379
The estate goes to probate.
Take it to probate court.

20:31.405 --> 20:33.058
What do you bug me with this?

20:34.909 --> 20:37.583
I come hereto discuss
a piece of business with you.

20:37.703 --> 20:40.707
And what are you gonna do?
You gonna tell me fairy tales?

20:40.831 --> 20:43.050
Who the fuck are you, slick?
Somebody knows you?

20:43.167 --> 20:45.295
<i>What are you, crazy?
I don't know you.</i>

20:45.419 --> 20:47.922
<i>I don't know
some clown named Gags.</i>

20:48.047 --> 20:49.469
Get outta here. Carl!

20:49.590 --> 20:51.843
Go ahead,
get the fuck outta here.

20:53.844 --> 20:55.642
- Hold it.
- All right, all right.

20:55.763 --> 20:57.231
Jesus Christ.

20:57.348 --> 20:59.771
All right, do what he says.

21:01.269 --> 21:02.737
- Do what he says.
- Lay down.

21:02.853 --> 21:04.821
Go ahead.

21:04.939 --> 21:08.739
Put your hands on your head.
Spread your legs. Now.

21:08.859 --> 21:11.237
Hey, you, you goof!
Look at the wall.

21:12.363 --> 21:15.993
I am the last guy
in the world...

21:16.117 --> 21:18.290
that you want to fuck with.

21:19.495 --> 21:22.248
You found
my money on Gags.

21:22.373 --> 21:25.343
Let us pretend you don't know
whose money it is.

21:25.459 --> 21:27.587
That's right.
I don't know who you are.

21:34.093 --> 21:36.221
Three hours.

21:36.345 --> 21:39.440
I will call to set a meet.

21:39.557 --> 21:44.154
You will pay me my money...
$185,000.

22:16.594 --> 22:18.312
Sit down.

22:29.940 --> 22:32.034
Thanks for comin' on down
so soon.

22:32.151 --> 22:34.119
I was comin' anyway.

22:37.198 --> 22:40.042
- How's it goin'?
- Me?

22:40.159 --> 22:41.877
I am doin' terrific.

22:43.079 --> 22:45.207
Every day is a surprise.

22:45.331 --> 22:48.380
It is real fuckin' weird
out there.

22:48.542 --> 22:50.715
It is nothing
like we figured out.

22:50.836 --> 22:53.430
So what's to it, my man?

22:53.547 --> 22:57.347
Same old shit. Morris finally busted
Red's pruno operation.

22:57.468 --> 22:59.937
- And a lot of knifings going on.
- Yeah. Dope?

23:00.054 --> 23:01.522
Yeah, that and sex.

23:01.639 --> 23:04.188
You wouldn't believe the quality
of people they're puttin' in here.

23:04.308 --> 23:08.233
Ten or 15 years ago, they'd have
dumped 'em in a funny farm somewhere.

23:08.396 --> 23:10.023
Rapists, child molesters.

23:10.147 --> 23:13.026
They put that shit in here
with the mainstream population.

23:13.150 --> 23:17.155
Used to be, somebody like that, if they
lasted five days, it'd be a record.

23:17.279 --> 23:19.031
Perverse.

23:19.156 --> 23:20.749
How's the wife?

23:21.742 --> 23:23.494
The wife?

23:24.787 --> 23:27.131
There's nothing with the wife.
I pulled the plug.

23:27.248 --> 23:29.171
What happened?

23:29.291 --> 23:31.043
Uh, I, uh...

23:31.168 --> 23:33.262
She does not know
I'm putting down scores...

23:33.379 --> 23:36.483
and the rocket scientist that
she is, she figures out...

23:37.425 --> 23:39.723
That I am having affairs
with fancy ladies.

23:41.595 --> 23:44.565
Anyway, it gets all screwy
and twisted.

23:44.682 --> 23:46.776
What are you gonna do?

23:46.892 --> 23:49.771
Well, I'm gonna
put it back together.

23:51.021 --> 23:54.241
Look, I met this new chick,
this Jessie.

23:54.358 --> 23:58.113
- You gonna marry her and have kids?
- Yes.

23:58.237 --> 23:59.955
But, uh...

24:00.114 --> 24:02.742
she does not know
what I do.

24:02.867 --> 24:06.292
So what?
Do I bullshit her along, or what?

24:08.205 --> 24:09.957
Lie to no one.

24:10.124 --> 24:13.219
If they're somebody close to you,
you're gonna ruin it with a lie.

24:13.335 --> 24:16.134
And if they're a stranger,
who are they you gotta lie to?

24:22.595 --> 24:25.314
Hey, what do you need, man?

24:25.431 --> 24:28.105
Get me out of here.

24:32.605 --> 24:34.778
Ten months
and you're on the street.

24:34.899 --> 24:37.243
- You know Doc Shelton?
- Yeah.

24:37.359 --> 24:40.283
That old bastard's killed more guys
than the electric chair.

24:41.447 --> 24:45.327
Well, I got angina somethin'
somethin' somethin'...

24:45.493 --> 24:48.497
and I'm not gonna last
ten months.

24:48.662 --> 24:50.915
And I don't want to die
in here, Frank.

24:51.040 --> 24:52.667
Not in here.

25:03.260 --> 25:05.638
Well, you got it.

25:07.264 --> 25:09.266
Gotta go, kid.

25:10.601 --> 25:12.148
You got it.

25:28.577 --> 25:31.376
He downed the merch to Gags
is what he said.

25:31.497 --> 25:34.967
I'm telling you, this cocksucker's
trouble. We whack him out.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.888
Is this the prowler?

25:40.047 --> 25:42.800
- The guy Gags had?
- Has to be the one.

25:57.731 --> 26:00.905
My name's Leo.
How are ya?

26:01.026 --> 26:03.370
How am I? I am Frank.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.418
Here's your money.

26:10.953 --> 26:12.671
Jesus Christ!

26:12.788 --> 26:15.337
There's two inches
of money out there.

26:19.295 --> 26:22.219
<i>- Is it all there?</i>
- I am sure that it is.

26:22.339 --> 26:26.560
<i>- Don't you say thanks or somethin'?</i>
- Whose money is this?

26:26.677 --> 26:30.432
Your money. But I stopped this guy
from giving you a hard time.

26:33.642 --> 26:35.895
<i>Well, thanks.</i>

26:36.020 --> 26:38.739
You're welcome.
It's no big deal.

26:38.856 --> 26:41.075
I'll see ya.

26:41.191 --> 26:43.364
- Where are you goin'?
- Where am I going?

26:43.485 --> 26:45.112
- Yeah.
- I am late.

26:45.237 --> 26:46.830
Come on.

26:46.947 --> 26:49.120
I thought we'd talk
a little business...

26:49.241 --> 26:51.039
get to know each other.

26:52.119 --> 26:54.042
Uh, no offense.

26:54.163 --> 26:58.464
You want to get to meet people,
join a lonely-hearts club.

26:58.584 --> 27:00.803
<i>I know you already.</i>

27:00.920 --> 27:02.797
<i>- Yeah?
- Yeah.</i>

27:04.006 --> 27:07.306
- How you know me?
- That merch you put down to Gags.

27:07.468 --> 27:09.141
Max Sherman.

27:09.303 --> 27:12.056
Puerto Rican fence.
Cotazar.

27:12.181 --> 27:14.855
Where do you think they down it?
To me.

27:14.975 --> 27:17.979
<i>I'm the bank.
I handle the fence for half this city.</i>

27:18.103 --> 27:20.652
You been puttin' down
two, three scores a month...

27:20.773 --> 27:22.491
month in, month out.

27:22.650 --> 27:24.652
I see your stuff.
You got great taste.

27:24.777 --> 27:27.451
<i>Regular highline pro.</i>

27:27.571 --> 27:31.451
So I said to Gags,
"I want to meet this guy."

27:31.575 --> 27:33.669
- He tell you that?
- Yes.

27:33.786 --> 27:36.130
- Fine.
- Let's cut the bullshit.

27:36.246 --> 27:37.668
<i>Who is he?</i>

27:37.790 --> 27:40.009
How the hell do I know?

27:41.794 --> 27:45.890
You want to put down contract scores all
over the country, working directly for me?

27:46.006 --> 27:47.974
I am self-employed.

27:48.092 --> 27:50.766
I am doin' fine.
I don't deal with egos.

27:50.886 --> 27:54.811
I am Joe the boss of my own body,
so what do I have to work for you for?

27:54.932 --> 27:58.311
Maybe you don't.
I'll lay it out. You can be the judge.

27:58.435 --> 27:59.812
<i>You don't look...</i>

27:59.937 --> 28:02.531
You don't case,
you don't do nothin'.

28:02.648 --> 28:04.616
We point you to a score.

28:04.733 --> 28:07.612
When we say it's there,
it's there.

28:07.736 --> 28:09.613
They're all laid-out scores.

28:09.738 --> 28:11.536
How are they worked up?

28:11.699 --> 28:14.669
Alarm system diagrams, blueprints,
sometimes a front-door key.

28:14.785 --> 28:16.460
Sometimes the scores are in on it.

28:16.486 --> 28:18.735
Everybody's ripping off
the insurance company.

28:18.831 --> 28:22.051
- Work cars? Drops? Tools?
- Whatever you need, you'd see me.

28:22.209 --> 28:24.052
I'd be your father.

28:24.211 --> 28:28.057
Money, guns, cars...
I'd be your father from here on out.

28:28.173 --> 28:31.598
- What's my end?
- You get a price. No negotiation.

28:31.719 --> 28:35.724
We got expenses you don't have.
But you'll know the price up front.

28:35.848 --> 28:37.475
- How big?
- Boxcar.

28:37.599 --> 28:41.103
Nothin' under six figures. I'll make
you a millionaire in four months.

28:41.228 --> 28:43.947
I go to work for you,
I'm pullin' a lot of exposure.

28:44.064 --> 28:46.237
- Our protection trades that off.
- Yeah, I take a bust.

28:46.358 --> 28:48.406
Turn around,
there's gonna be a lawyer...

28:48.527 --> 28:50.950
a bondsman right there...
you never spend a night in jail.

28:51.071 --> 28:54.200
Look, I steal ice.
No furs, no coin collections...

28:54.324 --> 28:58.170
no stock certificates, no cartage,
no Treasury bonds, no nothin'.

28:58.287 --> 29:00.255
- Just diamonds or cash.
- Fine.

29:00.372 --> 29:02.750
- No cowboy shit. No home invasions.
- Fine.

29:02.916 --> 29:05.260
- I work with a partner.
- We take care of you.

29:05.419 --> 29:09.014
A partner is strictly your responsibility.
He beefs on you, that's your problem.

29:09.131 --> 29:11.680
He beefs on us,
that's your problem too.

29:11.800 --> 29:12.927
Who are your inside people?

29:12.953 --> 29:15.625
That's my end. You don't have
to know anything about that.

29:15.763 --> 29:17.390
So what do you say?

29:17.514 --> 29:19.437
<i>I don't know.</i>

29:19.558 --> 29:22.232
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know!

29:22.352 --> 29:25.196
I don't believe
in lifetime subscriptions.

29:25.314 --> 29:27.549
Maybe it don't fit in with
my retirement program.

29:27.575 --> 29:29.139
What are you gonna do retired?

29:29.234 --> 29:32.063
Pick corn with the chickens.
Watch daytime TV the rest of my life.

29:32.089 --> 29:33.059
What's the difference?

29:33.155 --> 29:35.829
All right, all right.

29:35.949 --> 29:37.451
Two, three moves.

29:37.618 --> 29:39.541
You want to keep goin',
that's fine.

29:39.661 --> 29:42.335
But if you wanna split,
that's fine too.

29:42.456 --> 29:45.756
Everybody's business-like.
Everybody's an adult.

29:45.876 --> 29:48.095
So let me know...

29:48.212 --> 29:50.010
'cause we'd be terrific.

29:50.130 --> 29:53.304
Yeah, that's fine.
I'll call ya.

30:03.060 --> 30:06.655
<i>- You wanna pick him up?
- We'll see.</i>

31:35.611 --> 31:38.410
<i>Come on,
let's groove it one time.</i>

32:22.115 --> 32:25.619
- Hurry. I got my car parked in red.
- What the hell are you doing here?

32:25.744 --> 32:28.213
- Finding you.
- Get away from me, okay?

32:28.330 --> 32:31.004
You are two hours late.
I do not need this.

32:31.124 --> 32:33.252
I do not need to be humiliated.

32:33.377 --> 32:35.471
- Wait. I want to talk to you.
- No.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.510
<i>Hey, you!</i>

32:37.631 --> 32:40.851
I will take you for coffee and explain.
What's the big goddamn deal?

32:40.968 --> 32:42.970
You, take me anywhere?
That's a big laugh.

32:44.638 --> 32:47.642
- Look, maybe there is a reason.
- Hey, I'm talkin' to you.

32:47.766 --> 32:50.519
Hey! Take a walk, flash.
All right? Go on.

32:50.644 --> 32:53.147
- Hey, watch out, baby!

32:53.272 --> 32:55.900
I don't know the reason.
I don't want to hear the reason.

32:56.024 --> 32:57.822
There is no reason.
That's all.

32:57.985 --> 32:58.936
What's the big goddamn...

32:58.962 --> 33:01.014
- Look, you were lookin' forward to this.
All right?

33:01.154 --> 33:02.497
Come on.

33:05.075 --> 33:07.294
- Get in the car, darling.
- No!

33:23.385 --> 33:25.012
Wait a minute!

33:26.013 --> 33:27.856
<i>- Hey!
- My God!</i>

33:27.973 --> 33:29.850
<i>Oh, man!</i>

33:31.059 --> 33:33.608
- What did I do?
- Why did you push him?

33:46.616 --> 33:49.870
Look, in what I do,
there are sometimes pressures.

33:51.038 --> 33:54.383
What the hell
do you think that I do?

33:54.499 --> 33:56.376
Come on, come on!

33:56.501 --> 34:00.005
Come on! Every morning I walk in
for five months, say hi.

34:00.130 --> 34:02.224
What the hell
do you think that I do?

34:03.258 --> 34:07.354
You sell little fuckin' cars,
that's what you do.

34:07.471 --> 34:10.815
I wear $150 slacks!
I wear silk shirts!

34:10.931 --> 34:14.232
I wear $800 suits!
I wear a gold watch!

34:14.393 --> 34:17.568
I wear a perfect D flawless,
three-carat ring!

34:17.731 --> 34:21.156
I change cars like other guys
change their fuckin' shoes!

34:22.235 --> 34:23.908
I'm a thief.
I've been in prison.

34:24.071 --> 34:26.244
- So what? I don't care.
- "So what"?

34:26.364 --> 34:29.289
- Don't tell me
- I never even told my wife that!

34:29.409 --> 34:31.456
- I don't care!
- Who is now gone.

34:31.578 --> 34:33.672
- Did I ever come on to you?
- No.

34:33.789 --> 34:36.417
- Well, you see?
- See? See what?

34:36.583 --> 34:38.835
See... I am a straight arrow.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.213
I am a true-blue kind of a guy.

34:41.338 --> 34:43.841
I've been cool.
I am now unmarried.

34:43.965 --> 34:46.184
So let's cut the mini-moves
and the bullshit...

34:46.301 --> 34:48.645
and get on
with this big romance.

34:49.804 --> 34:51.773
What?

34:51.931 --> 34:53.650
I don't believe it!

34:53.766 --> 34:56.940
Do you think I have been waiting
for you to come along?

34:57.103 --> 34:58.856
What is this shit?

34:59.940 --> 35:03.865
You think I'm kiddin'. I can tell.
This is strictly on the up-and-up.

35:04.945 --> 35:07.164
Jesus Christ!

35:09.616 --> 35:12.961
- You are scared to death.
- You're an asshole.

35:13.120 --> 35:14.622
That's lovely.

35:14.746 --> 35:17.545
What are you doing in your life
that is so terrific?

35:17.666 --> 35:20.795
- My life is fine.
- Yeah, sure. Here.

35:20.961 --> 35:23.965
- You don't know about me.
- Yeah?

35:24.089 --> 35:27.309
- I know all about...
- You know bullshit.

35:27.426 --> 35:29.599
Hey.

35:29.719 --> 35:31.596
Why you gotta shout?

35:31.721 --> 35:34.816
Excuse me.
Can we have two coffees here?

35:34.975 --> 35:36.477
Sorry. So?

35:36.643 --> 35:38.270
<i>"So"?
So what?</i>

35:38.395 --> 35:39.988
So tell me.

35:40.147 --> 35:41.820
Menus?

35:41.940 --> 35:43.487
No, thanks.

35:44.860 --> 35:47.579
So, uh, what was it like?

35:49.656 --> 35:52.455
<i>You know, a lot of money.
Tucson...</i>

35:52.576 --> 35:54.544
Mexico City, Bogotá.

35:54.661 --> 35:57.130
Drifting, you know.
Okay?

35:57.247 --> 35:58.464
<i>Okay.</i>

35:58.582 --> 36:01.085
<i>It got twisted
and ugly and empty.</i>

36:01.209 --> 36:05.180
It was over already, but we kept
moving through the moves.

36:06.339 --> 36:08.216
It ended very badly.

36:09.676 --> 36:12.725
Now I get up in the morning,
I take a shower...

36:12.846 --> 36:17.022
I go to work, I have a job,
I have a Social Security card.

36:17.142 --> 36:19.895
And my life is very ordinary,
very boring...

36:20.020 --> 36:22.523
which is good,
because it's solid.

36:22.647 --> 36:25.526
You're marking time
is what you are.

36:25.650 --> 36:27.652
You're backing off.
You're hiding out.

36:27.777 --> 36:29.905
You're waiting for a bus
you hope never comes...

36:30.030 --> 36:33.204
because you don't want to get on it anyway
because you don't wanna go anywhere.

36:33.325 --> 36:35.999
Do you have a license for this?

36:36.119 --> 36:38.121
All right,
how much was he moving?

36:43.335 --> 36:45.588
Nothing, till the end.

36:46.880 --> 36:49.724
And then kilo amounts.
I don't... I don't know.

36:49.883 --> 36:51.726
And then what?

36:53.428 --> 36:55.647
- He's dead.
- Hmm?

36:55.764 --> 36:57.607
He is dead.

36:57.724 --> 37:00.898
That is good,
because he's an asshole.

37:01.019 --> 37:04.193
- There was a lot of love in the beginning.
- The guy was an asshole.

37:04.314 --> 37:07.739
- There was love in the beginning.
- A big asshole.

37:10.153 --> 37:13.407
He put you in a box.
You know the things they do to you...

37:13.532 --> 37:15.910
ten times a day
if you do a bit in Colombia?

37:16.034 --> 37:18.503
- Do you? Jesus Christ!
- Don't shout in here.

37:20.622 --> 37:22.624
I was alone.

37:22.749 --> 37:25.047
I had no money,
no clothes, no visa...

37:25.168 --> 37:28.889
standing on the corner
in Bogota' in Colombia.

37:29.005 --> 37:31.258
Things did happen.

37:31.383 --> 37:34.762
Where were you in prison?
Would you pass the cream, please?

37:35.804 --> 37:37.681
Joliet.

37:38.765 --> 37:40.767
The warden...
Whoa, God!

37:40.934 --> 37:44.063
Hey, can we have
some new cream here?

37:45.438 --> 37:47.065
What's wrong with it?

37:47.190 --> 37:49.318
"What's wrong with it?"
It's cottage cheese.

37:54.281 --> 37:57.455
The warden there was,
uh, Joe Reagan.

37:57.617 --> 37:59.290
"Meatball Joe."

38:00.370 --> 38:04.420
If that slob was a penologist,
I'm a jet airplane pilot.

38:04.541 --> 38:06.589
I did 11 years.

38:06.710 --> 38:08.883
I got out, what,
four years ago.

38:10.171 --> 38:12.674
<i>What'd you go up for?</i>

38:12.799 --> 38:14.597
I stole $40.

38:14.718 --> 38:16.265
Forty dollars?

38:17.971 --> 38:19.348
Yeah.

38:19.472 --> 38:24.353
<i>Started with a two-year bit,
parole in six months.</i>

38:24.477 --> 38:26.275
And then right away...

38:26.396 --> 38:28.615
I got into this problem
with these two guys.

38:28.732 --> 38:30.860
They tried to turn me out.

38:30.984 --> 38:33.157
So I picked up nine more...

38:33.278 --> 38:35.372
on a manslaughter beef...

38:35.488 --> 38:37.786
some other things.

38:37.907 --> 38:41.002
I was 20 when I went in,
31 when I come out.

38:42.871 --> 38:45.545
You don't count
months and years.

38:45.665 --> 38:47.667
You don't do time that way.

38:47.792 --> 38:50.716
What do you mean?
Why?

38:50.837 --> 38:53.636
<i>Why?
You gotta forget time.</i>

38:53.757 --> 38:56.806
You gotta not give a fuck
if you live or die.

38:56.926 --> 38:59.395
You gotta get to where
nothin' means nothin'.

39:00.930 --> 39:04.025
<i>I'll tell you a story
all about it.</i>

39:04.142 --> 39:07.942
Once there was
this Captain Morphis...

39:08.063 --> 39:11.567
this 300-pound slob.
He couldn't write his name.

39:11.691 --> 39:13.614
And he had this crew...

39:13.735 --> 39:17.080
of 16 or 17
guards and cons.

39:17.197 --> 39:19.370
Prison groups, you know?
Crews.

39:21.034 --> 39:23.332
They would go
into these cells...

39:23.453 --> 39:25.672
and grab these young guys...

39:25.789 --> 39:29.009
and bring 'em up
to hydrotherapy in the mental ward.

39:29.125 --> 39:31.048
Uh, gang bang.

39:31.169 --> 39:34.423
If a guy puts up a struggle,
they beat him half to death...

39:34.547 --> 39:36.549
and he winds up
in the funny farm.

39:36.716 --> 39:39.435
Anyway, word comes down
that I am next...

39:40.512 --> 39:43.140
and I do not know
what I am supposed to do.

39:43.264 --> 39:46.359
I, uh... I am scared.

39:48.353 --> 39:51.607
<i>11:30, 12:00,
lights come on.</i>

39:51.731 --> 39:54.780
I got this pipe
from plumbing...

39:56.569 --> 39:58.617
and, uh...

39:58.738 --> 40:01.912
I whacked the first guard
in the shins.

40:02.075 --> 40:04.919
I go through a convict
and another convict and...

40:05.036 --> 40:08.882
Anyway, I get to Morphis,
and I whack him across the head twice.

40:08.998 --> 40:12.844
Boom. And then they jump
all over me, do a bunch of things.

40:13.920 --> 40:17.766
I spent six months
in the hospital ward, but...

40:17.882 --> 40:21.477
Morphis, he is also
fucked up real good.

40:21.594 --> 40:23.642
Cerebral hematoma.

40:23.763 --> 40:25.982
They pension him out,
he can't walk straight...

40:26.099 --> 40:28.193
and he dies two years later...

40:28.309 --> 40:30.937
which is a real loss
to the planet Earth.

40:32.939 --> 40:35.283
<i>Meanwhile,
I gotta go back...</i>

40:35.400 --> 40:37.619
<i>into the mainstream population...</i>

40:37.736 --> 40:40.660
and I know the minute I hit the yard,
lam a dead man.

40:40.780 --> 40:43.624
<i>So I hit the yard.</i>

40:43.783 --> 40:46.286
<i>So you know what happens?</i>

40:48.621 --> 40:51.340
Nothin'.
I mean, nothin' happens.

40:52.542 --> 40:56.297
'Cause I don't mean nothin' to myself.
I don't care about me.

40:56.421 --> 40:59.800
I don't care about... nothin',
you know?

40:59.924 --> 41:04.225
And then I know
from that day that I survive...

41:04.345 --> 41:07.474
because I achieved
that mental attitude.

41:10.977 --> 41:13.526
Then, uh...

41:13.646 --> 41:16.274
see, later, I...

41:18.026 --> 41:19.994
I worked this out.

41:29.329 --> 41:31.707
<i>In the stone cell.</i>

41:31.831 --> 41:33.549
What is this?

41:33.666 --> 41:36.169
<i>That is my life.</i>

41:37.837 --> 41:39.680
And, uh...

41:39.839 --> 41:43.514
nothin', nobody can stop me
from makin' that happen.

41:46.012 --> 41:48.686
And right there,
that would be you.

41:51.309 --> 41:54.404
Who...
Who's the old man here?

41:54.521 --> 41:58.151
That is David Okla Bertinneau.

41:58.274 --> 42:01.027
He's a master thief-
a master...

42:01.194 --> 42:03.697
and a great man.

42:03.863 --> 42:06.992
He was like a father.
He taught me everything...

42:07.116 --> 42:08.993
that I know about what I do.

42:09.118 --> 42:11.041
And I told him about you.

42:12.497 --> 42:15.922
Did you cut these out
from magazines and...

42:16.042 --> 42:18.010
Yeah. Newspapers, whatever.

42:18.127 --> 42:20.050
Why...

42:20.171 --> 42:23.926
Why all of these
dead people?

42:24.050 --> 42:27.975
<i>Inside,
you are on ice from time.</i>

42:28.096 --> 42:31.066
You can't even die right,
you know? And here...

42:31.182 --> 42:33.355
<i>here, people grow.</i>

42:33.476 --> 42:35.353
<i>They get old, they die.</i>

42:35.478 --> 42:37.446
<i>Children come after.</i>

42:37.564 --> 42:39.566
<i>Just a cycle, you know?</i>

42:40.900 --> 42:42.823
I don't know. I...

42:42.944 --> 42:45.743
Yes, you do. You do.

42:45.864 --> 42:48.708
You don't know
from one day to the next...

42:48.825 --> 42:51.920
whether you're going to be killed,
go home, or get busted.

42:55.206 --> 42:58.460
Look, I have run out of time.

42:58.585 --> 43:02.135
I have lost it all.

43:02.255 --> 43:05.930
And so I can't work
fast enough to catch up...

43:06.050 --> 43:08.678
and I can't run
fast enough to catch up...

43:08.803 --> 43:11.101
and the only thing
that catches me up...

43:11.264 --> 43:13.266
is doin' my magic act.

43:13.433 --> 43:15.902
But it ends, you know?
It will end.

43:16.019 --> 43:18.397
When I got this,
right there...

43:18.521 --> 43:21.274
<i>it ends, it's over.</i>

43:21.441 --> 43:24.240
So I'm just asking you...

43:24.360 --> 43:26.454
to be with me.

43:32.493 --> 43:34.291
I can't.

43:34.454 --> 43:37.333
I can't, uh...

43:37.457 --> 43:40.802
I can't have children.

43:40.919 --> 43:42.967
I don't fit into this.

43:43.087 --> 43:45.215
What? So we adopt.

43:50.678 --> 43:54.182
I... I'm not ready, see?

43:54.307 --> 43:57.561
And-And I have my life.

43:57.685 --> 44:00.404
- So I... I can't.
<i>- What?</i>

44:01.731 --> 44:04.985
I mean, what is going on
in your life that is so terrific?

44:05.109 --> 44:06.656
Mine's been a mess.

44:08.655 --> 44:11.408
<i>I was just thinkin',
you know, that...</i>

44:11.532 --> 44:14.376
<i>just maybe
between the two of us...</i>

44:14.494 --> 44:16.622
<i>we could make
somethin' happen...</i>

44:16.746 --> 44:19.249
<i>somethin' special,
somethin' really nice.</i>

44:19.374 --> 44:20.967
<i>You know?</i>

44:22.377 --> 44:25.301
<i>So I'm just, uh...
I'm just askin' you...</i>

44:25.421 --> 44:28.721
uh, to, uh...

44:29.801 --> 44:33.726
Look, I got a way now
I can make it happen faster.

44:33.846 --> 44:35.769
I mean, much faster.

44:37.016 --> 44:39.860
And, uh, I'm just...

44:40.019 --> 44:42.989
I'm just askin' you,
you know?

45:19.559 --> 45:22.278
You're on.
They gotta be big scores.

45:22.395 --> 45:25.899
They gotta be fast.
One, two tops.

45:26.065 --> 45:27.658
Right.

45:34.407 --> 45:36.660
<i>- That's it.
- Where?</i>

45:36.784 --> 45:39.628
Third from the top, this side.

45:39.746 --> 45:42.875
- Alarm systems?
- Five independent systems.

45:42.999 --> 45:46.173
Four silent ringers into an alarm
company over the phone lines.

45:46.294 --> 45:47.967
Infrared pots...

45:48.087 --> 45:50.806
magnetics on the front door,
sonic alarm.

45:50.923 --> 45:53.301
<i>- Vault door's bugged.</i>
- What's this?

45:53.426 --> 45:56.976
This is the top floor.
Top of the elevator shafts.

45:57.096 --> 46:00.441
Floors eight through 14's alarm lines
conduit with the phones...

46:00.558 --> 46:02.276
through the top
of the elevator shaft.

46:02.393 --> 46:04.521
What about taking the elevator
to the top floor...

46:04.645 --> 46:06.693
open the hatch,
and goin' in that way?

46:06.814 --> 46:09.613
No. Elevators are locked down
and bugged at night.

46:09.776 --> 46:11.744
Your way, I gotta take out
two systems.

46:11.861 --> 46:14.034
Chop through the roof
and get the lines that way.

46:14.155 --> 46:16.704
Assuming we get the alarm,
what is the box?

46:16.824 --> 46:18.167
Richmond-Lackett.

46:18.284 --> 46:19.957
- <i>Richmond-Lackett?</i>
- Yeah.

46:21.537 --> 46:23.414
Terrific. It's a burn job.

46:23.539 --> 46:26.292
- No way to drill?
- "Drill"?

46:26.417 --> 46:28.795
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Drill what?

46:30.046 --> 46:34.051
They're custom-made. You bang
on this box all day, nothin' happens.

46:34.175 --> 46:36.678
<i>And I am pulling
a lot of exposure.</i>

46:36.803 --> 46:39.431
Sixteen, 18 hours in there.

46:39.555 --> 46:42.479
Your end covers the risk.
830,000.

46:42.600 --> 46:45.319
Four million at wholesale
in unmounted stones.

46:54.904 --> 46:58.124
- What's the fifth alarm?
- We cannot run it down.

46:58.241 --> 47:00.039
Why?

47:00.159 --> 47:02.708
Because it does not go out
over the phone lines.

47:02.829 --> 47:04.957
We swept the lines
in the whole building.

47:05.081 --> 47:09.336
But we know it is there.
How long?

47:09.460 --> 47:12.054
Four, eight weeks...

47:12.171 --> 47:14.014
assuming we get the alarm...

47:14.132 --> 47:16.134
and what to cut the box with.

47:17.635 --> 47:21.640
I need a couple Cal licenses,
and two new work cars here.

47:21.764 --> 47:24.557
Okay. I'll set it up.
What time's our plane?

47:24.583 --> 47:26.010
We're on the 2:30.

47:26.102 --> 47:28.446
Stay here
and make out that fifth alarm.

47:32.859 --> 47:34.532
<i>You like it?</i>

47:34.652 --> 47:36.529
I mean...

47:36.654 --> 47:39.578
do you think it'll do or what?
It's okay?

47:39.699 --> 47:43.044
Frank, I love it. I love it.
I think it's terrific.

47:47.039 --> 47:49.383
What are you looking at?

47:51.961 --> 47:53.884
You, that's all.

48:45.306 --> 48:47.274
Sam.

48:48.517 --> 48:50.019
How you doin'?

48:50.144 --> 48:52.863
Me, I'm golden, glowin',
scorin' like a champ.

48:52.980 --> 48:54.778
I need a favor.

48:56.275 --> 48:58.118
How's Okla?

48:58.277 --> 49:02.157
Angina. I'm makin' some moves
to get him out of there.

49:02.281 --> 49:04.409
I got a hearing fixed up.

49:04.533 --> 49:06.456
Who's the yo-yo
in the white coat?

49:06.619 --> 49:08.542
<i>Metallurgist
Son-in-law's idea.</i>

49:08.663 --> 49:11.086
A load of tubing comes in...

49:11.207 --> 49:13.380
I taste it, I smell it...

49:13.501 --> 49:16.254
I chew it, I spit on it.

49:16.379 --> 49:18.757
Hey, scientist cocksucker!

49:18.881 --> 49:22.431
Eighteen percent zinc,
43 percent copper...

49:22.551 --> 49:26.226
38 percent tin,
and one percent I don't know.

49:26.347 --> 49:29.396
A white coat. Around here
he wears a white coat.

49:29.517 --> 49:32.691
What's he?
Gonna discover penicillin?

49:32.812 --> 49:36.612
You gotta be a real putz
to wear a white coat around here.

49:41.195 --> 49:43.573
Huey, excuse us.

50:00.339 --> 50:03.684
- What kind of steel?
- Swedish cold-rolled, 247.

50:03.801 --> 50:07.055
Here, here,
here, and here.

50:07.179 --> 50:10.774
- One-inch plates.
- Copper to bind drills...

50:10.891 --> 50:13.360
titanium alloy here.

50:13.519 --> 50:16.022
This is a well-made,
very expensive...

50:16.147 --> 50:18.275
very special vault.

50:18.399 --> 50:20.117
- English?
- Mm.

50:20.234 --> 50:22.032
Richmond and Lackett?

50:22.153 --> 50:24.497
I need a very special
piece of equipment.

50:24.613 --> 50:28.709
- Drill a hole in the lockbox-
- No. Each one is made different.

50:28.826 --> 50:31.204
There's no way of telling
where the lockbox is.

50:31.329 --> 50:34.048
I want to cut me
a whole new door and walk in.

50:34.165 --> 50:37.260
Seven, eight thousand degrees?

50:37.376 --> 50:39.219
Portable equipment?

50:39.378 --> 50:41.881
- There's no other way to do it?
- No.

50:42.048 --> 50:45.143
Sonny,
if I can build something...

50:45.259 --> 50:48.388
it's gonna be
a son of a bitch to use.

50:48.512 --> 50:50.514
Okay, so is it worth it?

50:50.639 --> 50:52.562
It is worth it.

50:53.976 --> 50:56.900
- You sweep the phone?
- Weekly. it's clean.

51:23.881 --> 51:26.304
<i>Hello .I'm Frank.</i>

51:26.425 --> 51:30.350
<i>Leo said to call about
California licenses and registrations.</i>

51:30.471 --> 51:32.018
<i>Yeah.</i>

51:32.139 --> 51:36.110
<i>I'll be in Division 126 in an hour.
I'm wearing a gray leather coat.</i>

51:36.227 --> 51:37.570
Good.

51:39.146 --> 51:41.615
So what's to it, Sam?

51:41.732 --> 51:44.451
I gotta build
a section of vault to tell.

51:44.610 --> 51:48.535
So I don't know if it's even possible
to build a tool that'll cut it like that.

51:49.615 --> 51:51.458
See me in a week.

51:55.454 --> 51:59.175
The nature of this petition is that David
Okla Bertinneau pleads for Your Honor...

51:59.291 --> 52:01.965
to modify the instruction
of his 1958 conviction...

52:02.128 --> 52:04.130
and to issue
a writ of habeas corpus.

52:05.214 --> 52:09.060
But he violated Chapter 38,
Section 19-1: burglary...

52:09.176 --> 52:12.726
<i>Chapter 38, Section 16-1: theft...</i>

52:12.847 --> 52:15.691
Here's two California licenses
I fixed in Sacramento.

52:15.808 --> 52:18.186
...and dignity of the state.

52:25.067 --> 52:26.990
That distresses me,
Your Honor...

52:27.153 --> 52:28.996
'cause this man
is of reformed character...

52:29.155 --> 52:31.658
advanced age, and suffers
from a severe heart condition...

52:31.782 --> 52:34.626
<i>and may not be able
to serve out his sentence.</i>

52:34.743 --> 52:37.838
He's spent over 21 years
of incarceration...

52:37.997 --> 52:40.591
and has become
a different person.

52:42.668 --> 52:44.466
I don't know.

52:46.255 --> 52:48.804
I remain unconvinced.

52:48.924 --> 52:51.848
- Are they pickin' their noses?
- Wait. I want to hear this.

52:56.515 --> 52:59.359
However,
upon consideration...

52:59.518 --> 53:02.112
I will issue
a writ of habeas corpus.

53:02.229 --> 53:04.482
<i>Thank you, Your Honor.
I'll write up the order.</i>

53:04.607 --> 53:06.450
I know
how busy your docket is.

53:06.567 --> 53:09.616
My wife's in the market
for a fur coat.

53:14.033 --> 53:15.706
I am a car salesman.

53:15.826 --> 53:18.625
Sure.
Whatever you say.

53:18.746 --> 53:23.047
<i>- That's right.</i>

53:25.836 --> 53:28.214
Okla will be on the street
in a week.

53:28.380 --> 53:30.803
I need 6,000 for Earl Warren.

53:30.925 --> 53:33.929
A week? Yeah?
Here. Ten thousand.

53:34.053 --> 53:36.772
You're a prince.
Buy yourself a new suit.

53:36.889 --> 53:38.357
- A week?
- A week.

53:38.474 --> 53:39.896
All right.

53:56.617 --> 53:58.460
Who lives here?

53:58.577 --> 54:00.579
- Come on, who lives here?
- Hi.

54:00.746 --> 54:03.249
It's gotta be
some millionaire guy, huh?

54:03.374 --> 54:06.924
Hey, look at this.
Tree. Bush.

54:07.044 --> 54:09.138
- Pink tree.
- Hello!

54:09.255 --> 54:11.223
<i>- Hi!</i>
- Pink?

54:12.841 --> 54:16.186
- Hey. It's real nice.
- Sure. Come in back.

54:17.596 --> 54:19.940
- Hi, Frank.
- How you doin', Marie?

54:20.057 --> 54:22.685
- This is beautiful, man.
<i>- When did you get back?</i>

54:22.810 --> 54:25.438
Oh, uh, last night, late.

54:26.814 --> 54:30.614
You, uh... you make
that fifth alarm?

54:30.776 --> 54:32.699
I made the fifth alarm.

54:35.322 --> 54:36.699
Good.

54:43.122 --> 54:45.796
- So, uh, what's to it?
- Okay.

54:45.916 --> 54:49.841
Alarm system number five
is a one-channel radio transmitter.

54:51.088 --> 54:55.013
- How's it triggered?
- There's a sonic detector off the ceiling.

54:55.134 --> 54:57.741
They set off the alarm every
morning when they walk in.

54:57.767 --> 54:59.255
Ring, ring, ring.
It's tripped.

54:59.346 --> 55:03.396
They have ten seconds to transmit a code
word to the alarm company to cancel it.

55:03.517 --> 55:06.396
Now, the code word
goes over the radio.

55:06.520 --> 55:08.989
That's why
there's no phone lines.

55:10.024 --> 55:12.243
All right, I tell you what.

55:12.359 --> 55:14.236
- You bug it.
- All right.

55:14.361 --> 55:16.784
Call Joseph, have him fix you one,
go back out there...

55:16.905 --> 55:18.828
and you bug 'em for the word.

55:18.991 --> 55:20.868
Come on.
It's gettin' cold.

55:20.993 --> 55:23.212
Oh. Uh...

55:23.329 --> 55:25.331
this L.A. move, you know-

55:25.456 --> 55:28.209
it's home free for me
after it's done.

55:31.003 --> 55:32.676
You happy?

55:34.256 --> 55:35.929
Come on.

55:43.390 --> 55:45.358
Frank,
want something to eat?

55:46.894 --> 55:50.319
Well...

55:54.860 --> 55:57.079
I see
on your application here...

55:57.196 --> 55:59.324
By the way,
you misspelled "male."

55:59.448 --> 56:01.667
It's M-A-L-E.

56:01.784 --> 56:04.162
The other is what
we put in postboxes.

56:04.286 --> 56:06.004
<i>I see you put
under "employer"...</i>

56:06.121 --> 56:10.217
"1959 to 1976,
Joliet State Penitentiary."

56:10.334 --> 56:14.589
- Yes.
- You worked for the state, I take it?

56:14.713 --> 56:17.432
- After a fashion.
- What did you do at the prison?

56:17.549 --> 56:20.223
Desks.

56:20.344 --> 56:22.597
I, uh, spot-welded desks...

56:22.721 --> 56:24.598
and then I got
promoted to shoes.

56:24.723 --> 56:26.691
<i>You were in charge
of the shop?</i>

56:26.809 --> 56:29.528
Lady, I was a convict.
I was doing time.

56:29.645 --> 56:32.194
- You were what?
- Frank, let's go.

56:32.314 --> 56:35.443
<i>Uh, you have to understand...</i>

56:35.567 --> 56:38.286
<i>we have more applicants
than children.</i>

56:38.404 --> 56:40.372
Then why do you still
have kids here?

56:40.489 --> 56:44.665
As a kid, I would not be falling all over
myself to stay in one of these places.

56:44.785 --> 56:46.879
We will relieve you
of some of the burden.

56:46.995 --> 56:51.501
The point is, we establish
criteria for parenting...

56:51.625 --> 56:54.048
and an ex-convict
compared to other desirables...

56:54.169 --> 56:56.922
Wait. So we'll take a kid
that's not so desirable.

56:57.047 --> 56:59.425
You got a black kid?
We'll take a black kid.

56:59.550 --> 57:01.678
<i>- You got a Chink kid?
- You don't understand...</i>

57:01.802 --> 57:05.079
No one likes older kids. You got
an eight-year-old black Chink kid?

57:05.105 --> 57:05.923
We'll take him.

57:06.014 --> 57:09.985
- Frank...
- If it's a matter of, you know... here.

57:10.102 --> 57:12.104
- What is that?
- "What is that"?

57:12.229 --> 57:15.654
That is D flawless,
3.2 carats, emerald-cut.

57:15.774 --> 57:18.573
- This is not a marketplace.
- <i>Right.</i>

57:18.694 --> 57:22.574
You're not smart enough to take this any
more than you are to recognize good parents.

57:22.698 --> 57:25.542
Get out of my office.

57:25.659 --> 57:28.583
You did not ask about us,
what kind of people we are.

57:28.704 --> 57:32.379
There is a child waiting,
and you are denying us him and him us.

57:32.499 --> 57:34.672
- Who the hell are you?
- Don't make a scene.

57:34.793 --> 57:37.797
- Our criteria...
- Your criteria?

57:37.963 --> 57:41.809
Your criteria are so far up your ass, they
can't see daylight. This is bullshit!

57:41.967 --> 57:44.265
Look, it's not happening.
Let's go.

57:44.386 --> 57:47.265
I got some ABC-type
information for you, lady.

57:47.389 --> 57:49.391
I was state-raised...

57:49.516 --> 57:51.610
and this is a dead place.

57:51.727 --> 57:54.480
A child in eight-by-four
green walls...

57:54.605 --> 57:57.233
after a while you tell the walls,
"My life is yours."

57:57.357 --> 57:59.951
- You grow up in the suburbs?
- Yes.

58:00.068 --> 58:02.241
Right. Right.

58:05.407 --> 58:07.751
What are you lookin' at?
Huh?

58:58.544 --> 59:00.217
Jimmy's got better.

59:00.379 --> 59:04.054
<i>Yeah, it's 'cause
he charcoals them... charcoals.</i>

59:07.469 --> 59:10.063
- I'm gonna pull him over here.
- Yeah.

59:45.591 --> 59:48.390
Hey, how you doin'?

59:48.510 --> 59:51.263
- I'm wonderful, thank you.
- Yeah, that's good.

59:51.388 --> 59:54.267
You know, a very important thing
for you to remember...

59:54.433 --> 59:57.232
is gonna be my name:
Sergeant Urizzi.

59:57.352 --> 59:59.070
Urizzi. Why's that?

59:59.187 --> 01:00:01.656
Because I'm gonna do
good things for ya.

01:00:01.773 --> 01:00:03.901
What for?
Good-conduct medal?

01:00:04.026 --> 01:00:05.653
Nah.

01:00:05.777 --> 01:00:07.996
I'm here to make life
easy for you.

01:00:08.113 --> 01:00:11.413
- Oh, yeah?
- Smooth out the bumps and the humps.

01:00:11.533 --> 01:00:13.752
You know...
your relationship with us.

01:00:13.869 --> 01:00:16.372
I didn't know I had one.

01:00:17.623 --> 01:00:21.469
Look, we're your new partners.
We're in for ten points.

01:00:22.878 --> 01:00:24.801
What'd this set you back?

01:00:25.881 --> 01:00:27.758
Ten points of what?

01:00:27.883 --> 01:00:30.306
You know.

01:00:30.469 --> 01:00:32.471
The guy? Leo.

01:00:32.596 --> 01:00:34.564
Your action.

01:00:37.684 --> 01:00:39.652
I don't get this.
What's with you?

01:00:39.770 --> 01:00:41.647
Listen.

01:00:41.772 --> 01:00:44.150
Our end...

01:00:44.274 --> 01:00:47.118
goes with the territory.

01:00:47.235 --> 01:00:50.114
Don't you know
you gotta come up?

01:00:50.238 --> 01:00:52.366
I am a car salesman.

01:00:52.491 --> 01:00:55.085
You guys want a deal
on a Buick, come on.

01:00:55.202 --> 01:00:57.079
<i>- Hey, motherfucker...</i>
- Wait, wait.

01:00:57.204 --> 01:00:59.127
Don't you come on to me.
And you...

01:00:59.247 --> 01:01:02.501
You want to pinch me, pinch me.
I'll be out in ten minutes.

01:01:02.626 --> 01:01:05.971
If not, get the
fuck off my car!

01:02:00.559 --> 01:02:03.062
You all right?

01:02:03.228 --> 01:02:06.027
What does this mean?

01:02:06.148 --> 01:02:08.071
It means...

01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:10.410
heat, police.

01:02:10.569 --> 01:02:14.415
Means it's hard for me
to make moves from now on.

01:02:14.531 --> 01:02:16.954
Beepers on the cars,
the works.

01:02:18.243 --> 01:02:22.089
Are they in the walls? Can they hear
everything we say all the time?

01:02:22.205 --> 01:02:25.209
Probably it's just the phones,
but I'll check.

01:02:25.333 --> 01:02:27.051
You're uneasy.

01:02:31.798 --> 01:02:33.892
Fuck this house.
We move.

01:02:34.009 --> 01:02:36.808
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:02:40.307 --> 01:02:42.275
Bastards.

01:03:02.621 --> 01:03:06.342
I got this business deal
from your end of the L.A. score.

01:03:06.458 --> 01:03:08.460
Want me to put some of it
to work for you?

01:03:08.585 --> 01:03:09.395
Street juice?

01:03:09.421 --> 01:03:12.660
"Juice"? You couldn't get
me out of bed for that.

01:03:12.756 --> 01:03:14.929
We're not cuttin' up
nickels here.

01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:16.597
Shopping centers.

01:03:16.718 --> 01:03:19.312
Fort Worth,
Davenport, Jackson.

01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:20.806
Strictly legit.

01:03:20.931 --> 01:03:23.434
- My money goes in my pocket.
- Yours if you want in.

01:03:23.558 --> 01:03:25.481
Gonna give you
everything you need.

01:03:25.644 --> 01:03:28.397
You don't have to tell me now.
Let me know later.

01:03:28.522 --> 01:03:31.025
Let you know?
What I want to know is...

01:03:31.149 --> 01:03:34.153
why the minute I get locked up with you,
everybody knows my business.

01:03:34.277 --> 01:03:36.245
My house is bugged.
My wife is upset.

01:03:36.363 --> 01:03:38.331
The guy at the Vehicle Bureau
wants a fur coat.

01:03:38.490 --> 01:03:41.835
There's a cop tail half a block
down the street. My car is bugged.

01:03:41.993 --> 01:03:45.668
Here. This one behind the bumper
I'm supposed to find.

01:03:45.831 --> 01:03:49.426
The other one in the wheel well is supposed
to fool me. What the hell is this?

01:03:49.543 --> 01:03:51.841
- Leave it to me.
- Leave what to you? Do it!

01:03:51.962 --> 01:03:54.260
I said I'll take care of it.

01:03:54.381 --> 01:03:57.681
- What about burning the vault?
- What about it?

01:03:57.801 --> 01:03:59.599
- Can you do it?
- I don't know.

01:03:59.719 --> 01:04:02.472
Okay.
Fifth alarm system?

01:04:02.597 --> 01:04:04.565
Nothing yet.

01:04:04.683 --> 01:04:06.685
<i>Okay.</i>

01:04:08.687 --> 01:04:10.735
What else you got
on your mind?

01:04:12.107 --> 01:04:14.030
What are you talking about?

01:04:14.192 --> 01:04:17.492
You got family troubles?
Somethin' with the old lady?

01:04:17.612 --> 01:04:21.583
- What is this, Dear fuckin' Abby?
- You tryin' to adopt a kid?

01:04:29.124 --> 01:04:31.047
How you know that?

01:04:31.209 --> 01:04:34.008
Barry mentioned to Mitch,
Mitch to me.

01:04:34.129 --> 01:04:37.975
You got friends.
Lighten up, for chrissake.

01:04:38.091 --> 01:04:40.219
Why don't you come to me
with your problems?

01:04:40.385 --> 01:04:42.604
What am I,
a fuckin' stranger?

01:04:42.721 --> 01:04:45.565
I take care of my people.
Anything you want.

01:04:45.682 --> 01:04:48.811
You and me, we do business.
I do not mix apples and oranges.

01:04:48.935 --> 01:04:50.152
- Yeah, bullshit.
- "Bullshit"?

01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:52.364
Yeah.

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:55.450
With my wife, with my kids...

01:04:55.567 --> 01:04:58.070
that's my whole life.

01:04:58.236 --> 01:05:02.241
We are very tight.
Kids are special, a miracle.

01:05:02.407 --> 01:05:04.409
A little hoochie-coo,
drop of energy...

01:05:04.576 --> 01:05:06.419
wham, bam, magic Sam...

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:08.914
there's something
sacred there.

01:05:13.126 --> 01:05:15.094
That's my attitude.

01:05:23.637 --> 01:05:25.765
What happens?

01:05:25.931 --> 01:05:27.649
You state your model.

01:05:27.766 --> 01:05:30.110
Black, brown, yellow or white.

01:05:30.268 --> 01:05:31.861
Boy or girl.

01:05:31.978 --> 01:05:34.231
Where from?

01:05:36.107 --> 01:05:38.075
Couple of ladies.

01:05:38.193 --> 01:05:41.117
They got babies to sell.

01:05:41.238 --> 01:05:44.538
<i>- Their own. They sell 'em.</i>
- Jesus!

01:05:44.658 --> 01:05:47.127
It's not the kid's fault
his mother's an asshole.

01:05:47.285 --> 01:05:50.960
And you're not buyin' the mother. You're
not gonna get a kid on the straight.

01:06:03.385 --> 01:06:05.103
I want a boy.

01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:07.643
- Done.
<i>- Hmm?</i>

01:06:07.764 --> 01:06:09.607
Done. You got a boy.

01:06:09.724 --> 01:06:10.913
- Yeah?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

01:06:10.939 --> 01:06:12.127
I got a boy?

01:06:12.227 --> 01:06:14.275
Yeah.
What else you want?

01:06:16.564 --> 01:06:19.067
- You son of a bitch!
- Hey, Mitch, get the...

01:06:19.192 --> 01:06:21.490
Yeah! You got a boy.
Get outta here.

01:06:23.905 --> 01:06:27.125
<i>Gimme a phone, will ya?</i>

01:06:27.242 --> 01:06:29.040
<i>Right.</i>

01:06:35.041 --> 01:06:36.714
Hey, Jess.

01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:21.592
It's okay. Go ahead.

01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:32.228
Hey, pal.

01:07:34.434 --> 01:07:36.778
What are you doin'?
You playin' sick in here?

01:07:38.021 --> 01:07:40.615
I got three chicks
waitin' for you on the street.

01:07:40.732 --> 01:07:42.700
You're gonna get me in trouble.

01:07:44.444 --> 01:07:46.242
Goof.

01:07:49.491 --> 01:07:52.711
Oh, this is my wife, Jessie.

01:07:56.289 --> 01:07:57.711
Frank.

01:08:09.469 --> 01:08:11.346
Code blue.
You'll have to leave.

01:08:11.471 --> 01:08:13.144
- No.
- You'll have to leave.

01:08:13.264 --> 01:08:14.937
<i>Frank, come on.</i>

01:08:19.979 --> 01:08:21.777
After the hearing...

01:08:21.939 --> 01:08:24.363
Judge Ramsey's court
writ him mittimus papers.

01:08:24.484 --> 01:08:26.452
The board had
to release him to me.

01:08:27.737 --> 01:08:29.738
<i>On the stairs outside...</i>

01:08:29.863 --> 01:08:31.582
<i>he just dropped.</i>

01:08:31.698 --> 01:08:33.827
<i>What did he whisper to you?</i>

01:08:35.203 --> 01:08:39.582
<i>He said, uh...
he said thanks, you know...</i>

01:08:39.707 --> 01:08:41.300
for gettin' him out.

01:08:41.459 --> 01:08:43.381
That's the big thing,
you know...

01:08:43.502 --> 01:08:45.971
not to die in that joint,
not to die in there.

01:08:46.089 --> 01:08:48.638
It's a big thing.

01:08:51.970 --> 01:08:54.018
- Who's Mr. Bertinneau's family?
- I am.

01:08:54.139 --> 01:08:56.938
Look, I'm sorry
he didn't make it.

01:08:57.058 --> 01:09:00.028
If there's anything
I can do, uh...

01:09:02.647 --> 01:09:05.571
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry.

01:09:12.323 --> 01:09:14.325
Do you want to sit down?

01:10:07.295 --> 01:10:08.888
Refill.

01:10:13.259 --> 01:10:15.227
That's a nice baby.

01:10:15.386 --> 01:10:17.229
You lucky you got
such a nice baby.

01:10:17.388 --> 01:10:19.891
Thank you very much.
Can you warm this up?

01:10:20.016 --> 01:10:23.020
Sure, no problem.
What his name, huh?

01:10:23.144 --> 01:10:25.067
No name, not yet.

01:10:31.736 --> 01:10:34.489
So... here we are.

01:10:37.492 --> 01:10:39.085
Are you okay?

01:10:42.288 --> 01:10:45.337
Long, long, long, long time.

01:10:47.085 --> 01:10:49.087
You see that?

01:10:49.212 --> 01:10:52.386
Okla dies,
and our baby is born.

01:10:52.507 --> 01:10:54.760
Do you want to name him
after Okla?

01:11:00.598 --> 01:11:03.021
Okla's real name was David.

01:11:04.102 --> 01:11:06.275
David.

01:11:06.396 --> 01:11:07.943
David.

01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.568
David?

01:11:11.693 --> 01:11:13.445
David?

01:11:14.779 --> 01:11:17.282
Hey!

01:11:21.661 --> 01:11:24.710
Our kid,
his name is David.

01:11:24.831 --> 01:11:27.880
David.
David good name.

01:11:35.883 --> 01:11:37.885
Hey, David.

01:11:39.304 --> 01:11:40.897
What's to it?

01:11:46.269 --> 01:11:49.443
<i>Light this,
then get out of the way.</i>

01:12:19.135 --> 01:12:21.137
Not bad.

01:12:21.262 --> 01:12:23.185
I'll see ya, kid.

01:12:37.028 --> 01:12:39.406
I don't think so. There's something
going around the school.

01:12:39.530 --> 01:12:42.875
<i>Did you call a doctor?</i>

01:12:42.992 --> 01:12:45.495
- <i>He had to give her a shot.</i>
- Yeah?

01:13:03.971 --> 01:13:06.520
He gave Ruth a shot.
Twenty-four hours, it was gone.

01:13:06.641 --> 01:13:08.689
<i>Must've been a flu bug
or something.</i>

01:13:13.523 --> 01:13:16.402
Mexico. We're in, thanks.

01:13:36.587 --> 01:13:38.931
Did you remember
cream and sugar for my coffee?

01:13:39.090 --> 01:13:41.138
I have never forgotten
your cream and sugar.

01:13:47.432 --> 01:13:50.811
Yeah. Have Julio
wax the floor, will ya?

01:13:59.026 --> 01:14:01.575
- Yeah, Green Mill.
- Is Frank there?

01:14:01.696 --> 01:14:03.994
Wait a minute. Frank?

01:14:04.115 --> 01:14:06.538
Oscar, get Frank.

01:14:06.659 --> 01:14:08.502
Hey, come back.

01:14:13.124 --> 01:14:14.546
Telephone.

01:14:16.711 --> 01:14:18.088
Yeah?

01:14:18.212 --> 01:14:19.930
<i>- Is that you?
- Yeah, hold on.</i>

01:14:20.047 --> 01:14:22.141
- Do me a favor.
- Psst! Move down.

01:14:22.258 --> 01:14:25.137
<i>- Yeah, go ahead.
- We are on.</i>

01:14:25.261 --> 01:14:28.105
<i>You understand?</i>

01:14:28.222 --> 01:14:30.725
Yes. I understand.

01:15:07.845 --> 01:15:10.018
Come on! Come on!

01:15:10.139 --> 01:15:12.813
Give me an excuse!
Come on!

01:15:17.188 --> 01:15:18.861
Get out of that car!

01:15:30.117 --> 01:15:32.245
- You're pinched, jagoff!
- For what?

01:15:32.370 --> 01:15:34.543
Driving without a taillight.

01:16:08.364 --> 01:16:10.241
Pick him up, huh?

01:16:12.201 --> 01:16:13.794
<i>Fuck!</i>

01:16:21.085 --> 01:16:23.429
Hey, car salesman: Urizzi.

01:16:23.588 --> 01:16:25.761
You remember my name now?

01:16:25.923 --> 01:16:27.800
How can I not...

01:16:27.925 --> 01:16:30.178
since the police department...

01:16:30.303 --> 01:16:32.806
does not hire
too many Puerto Ricans.

01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:35.604
Hey, asshole, I'm Italian!

01:16:36.601 --> 01:16:39.730
I'm pleased to meet you,
ugly wop son of a bitch.

01:16:39.854 --> 01:16:42.198
You motherfucker!

01:16:42.315 --> 01:16:44.283
You're a stand-up guy.

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.402
You're a real stand-up guy.

01:16:46.527 --> 01:16:49.952
You got a mouth.
You can take a trimmin'.

01:16:50.114 --> 01:16:53.084
<i>You could make things easy
for everybody. But no.</i>

01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.703
You gotta be a goof.

01:16:55.828 --> 01:16:57.421
You're real good.

01:16:57.538 --> 01:16:59.256
<i>No violence.</i>

01:16:59.373 --> 01:17:01.967
Strictly professional.

01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:04.132
I'd probably like ya.

01:17:04.295 --> 01:17:06.969
Like to go to the track,
ball games...

01:17:07.089 --> 01:17:09.717
stuff like that, you know?

01:17:11.302 --> 01:17:14.146
Frank, there's ways
of doin' things...

01:17:14.305 --> 01:17:16.228
that round off the corners...

01:17:16.349 --> 01:17:18.522
make life easy for everybody.

01:17:18.643 --> 01:17:22.864
What's wrong with that?
There's plenty to go around.

01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:26.780
We know what you take down.

01:17:26.901 --> 01:17:30.121
We know you got somethin' major
comin' down soon.

01:17:30.237 --> 01:17:34.743
But no, you gotta come on
like a stiff prick!

01:17:34.867 --> 01:17:37.541
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

01:17:37.662 --> 01:17:40.461
<i>What's the matter with you?
You got somethin' to say...</i>

01:17:40.581 --> 01:17:43.676
or you waitin' for me
to ask you to dance?

01:17:43.793 --> 01:17:46.387
Did it ever occur to you...

01:17:46.504 --> 01:17:48.472
to try to work for a livin'?

01:17:48.589 --> 01:17:51.684
- Take down your own scores?
<i>- Okay, fuck this guy.</i>

01:17:51.801 --> 01:17:54.725
Tell you something:
I'm gonna be on your ass so much...

01:17:54.845 --> 01:17:57.598
you're gonna get careless,
and on that day...

01:17:57.723 --> 01:17:59.817
I'm gonna be in that place.

01:17:59.934 --> 01:18:03.279
And that is the last place...

01:18:03.396 --> 01:18:06.741
that you want to be,
'cause no matter what happens...

01:18:06.857 --> 01:18:10.031
I will never, ever
take a pinch...

01:18:10.152 --> 01:18:12.655
from a greasy motherfucker
like you.

01:18:13.864 --> 01:18:16.913
Motherfucker!
I'll kill you right here!

01:18:17.034 --> 01:18:20.584
- Dancin' goes two ways, prick!
- Get this asshole out of here!

01:18:22.707 --> 01:18:24.380
Cut him loose.

01:18:31.549 --> 01:18:33.893
- John?
- Yeah?

01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:36.388
You got eyes?
You got him?

01:18:36.512 --> 01:18:38.765
Yeah, he's beepin' in good.

01:18:38.889 --> 01:18:41.062
<i>Okay.</i>

01:18:57.783 --> 01:19:00.753
Pull over!

01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:03.089
He'll spot us.
He's stoppin'.

01:19:23.225 --> 01:19:25.353
John, what's he doin'?

01:19:25.478 --> 01:19:28.948
Just relax and stay put.

01:20:02.014 --> 01:20:03.982
Hit it! Hit it!
He's movin'!

01:20:17.488 --> 01:20:19.161
Hit it.

01:20:28.457 --> 01:20:31.336
Okay, relax and fall back.
We got him.

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:33.713
We're right with you.

01:20:35.464 --> 01:20:38.092
What do you think
he's gonna put down?

01:20:38.217 --> 01:20:41.562
I don't know. But we're gonna be
right on this guy's ass.

01:20:41.679 --> 01:20:43.898
This guy's gonna be history.

01:20:45.891 --> 01:20:47.643
Gimme some coffee.

01:24:45.089 --> 01:24:47.057
- Okay.
- Here.

01:24:57.101 --> 01:24:59.445
Forty volts.
You got a phone line.

01:25:06.151 --> 01:25:08.119
Phone.

01:25:14.368 --> 01:25:16.416
Hold it. You got one.

01:25:18.789 --> 01:25:20.291
Hook it up.

01:25:33.095 --> 01:25:34.642
Go.

01:25:41.019 --> 01:25:42.145
Phone.

01:25:49.403 --> 01:25:51.076
Yeah.

01:25:53.615 --> 01:25:56.118
Come on.
One more and we open her up.

01:26:41.872 --> 01:26:43.874
- Mexico.

01:27:08.607 --> 01:27:10.405
All right, I'm inside.

01:27:11.652 --> 01:27:14.155
Any surges on the line?

01:27:16.990 --> 01:27:18.913
They held.

01:27:19.034 --> 01:27:21.412
Come on. We own it.

01:28:22.556 --> 01:28:24.650
- Lit?
- No.

01:28:27.269 --> 01:28:28.987
<i>Okay.</i>

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:20.622
Hey!

01:34:21.665 --> 01:34:23.542
You should come in.
The water's great.

01:34:23.667 --> 01:34:26.546
Yeah. Enjoy it now.
We're goin' home.

01:34:26.670 --> 01:34:29.173
Tomorrow we collect.
Just talked to Leo.

01:34:29.339 --> 01:34:31.512
That's great, man.

01:34:31.675 --> 01:34:33.143
Hey, Marie.

01:34:35.512 --> 01:34:37.139
Marie.

01:35:55.383 --> 01:35:57.431
I'll go get the bags.

01:37:01.241 --> 01:37:03.253
Come on in, Frank. Sit down.
- Thank you.

01:37:03.279 --> 01:37:04.236
How you doin'?

01:37:04.327 --> 01:37:06.000
- Good, good.
- You look great.

01:37:06.162 --> 01:37:09.462
- Couldn't be better.
- I know this is what you're here for, kid.

01:37:10.667 --> 01:37:13.546
That's it.
Mitch, what's to it?

01:37:13.670 --> 01:37:16.469
Your tan is great.
How long were you in San Diego?

01:37:17.674 --> 01:37:21.099
- A few days.
- Mitch told me all about the score.

01:37:21.219 --> 01:37:23.813
Said that you were Dr. Wizard.

01:37:23.930 --> 01:37:25.352
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:37:27.058 --> 01:37:29.356
Hello, Frank.

01:37:33.231 --> 01:37:36.485
- Where's the rest?
- Don't worry about it.

01:37:37.902 --> 01:37:39.529
What is this?

01:37:39.654 --> 01:37:41.577
This is the cash part.

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:47.162
Well, you're light.

01:37:47.287 --> 01:37:49.335
830,000 is supposed be here...

01:37:49.455 --> 01:37:51.549
and I count, what, 70, 80, 90.

01:37:51.666 --> 01:37:54.044
That's because I put you
into the Jacksonville, Fort Worth...

01:37:54.169 --> 01:37:56.388
and Davenport shopping centers
with the rest.

01:37:56.546 --> 01:37:58.423
I take care of my people.

01:37:58.548 --> 01:38:00.676
You can ask these guys.
Papers are at your house.

01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:02.552
It's set up
as a limited partnership.

01:38:02.719 --> 01:38:05.047
The general partner is a
subchapter S corporation.

01:38:05.073 --> 01:38:06.669
You've got equity
with me in that.

01:38:09.434 --> 01:38:12.984
- Well, count me out.
- I thought we had this good thing.

01:38:14.105 --> 01:38:18.406
Plus, I got a major score
in Palm Beach for you in six weeks.

01:38:21.571 --> 01:38:24.541
You talkin' to me,
or somebody else walk in this room?

01:38:28.745 --> 01:38:30.668
What's that supposed
to mean?

01:38:32.498 --> 01:38:34.876
It means you are dreaming.

01:38:35.001 --> 01:38:37.095
This is payday.
It is over.

01:38:41.716 --> 01:38:44.970
You know, when you have
trouble with the cops...

01:38:45.094 --> 01:38:49.065
you pay 'em off like everybody else,
because that's the way things are done.

01:38:50.350 --> 01:38:52.694
- But not you, huh?
- No.

01:38:52.810 --> 01:38:55.359
They don't run me,
and you don't run me.

01:38:56.272 --> 01:38:59.071
I give you houses.
I give you a car. You're family.

01:39:00.568 --> 01:39:03.321
I thought you'd come around.
What the hell is this? What...

01:39:03.446 --> 01:39:05.073
Where is gratitude?

01:39:05.198 --> 01:39:06.791
Where is my end?

01:39:06.908 --> 01:39:09.752
You can't see day for night.

01:39:09.869 --> 01:39:13.749
I can see my money
is still in your pocket...

01:39:13.873 --> 01:39:16.467
which is from the yield
of my labor.

01:39:19.629 --> 01:39:21.222
What gratitude?

01:39:22.674 --> 01:39:25.223
You're making big profits
from my work...

01:39:25.343 --> 01:39:27.311
my risk, my sweat...

01:39:27.428 --> 01:39:29.726
but that is okay...

01:39:29.847 --> 01:39:32.066
because I elected
to make that deal...

01:39:32.183 --> 01:39:34.231
but now the deal is over.

01:39:34.352 --> 01:39:36.980
I want my end,
and I am out.

01:39:41.985 --> 01:39:44.158
Why don't you join
a labor union?

01:39:46.906 --> 01:39:50.160
- I am wearing it.
- Frank, don't.

01:39:50.285 --> 01:39:52.629
Do it, slick.

01:39:53.621 --> 01:39:57.842
My money in 24 hours,
or you will wear your ass for a hat.

01:39:57.959 --> 01:39:59.882
Get him the hell outta here.

01:40:01.254 --> 01:40:04.258
Did I tell ya?
What did I tell ya?

01:40:41.711 --> 01:40:43.304
Where is he?

01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:47.554
Where is he?
Where is he?

01:41:26.714 --> 01:41:28.637
Hey, Barry?

01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:32.933
Talk to him!

01:41:33.054 --> 01:41:35.022
Answer him.

01:41:39.644 --> 01:41:42.272
Answer him.
Answer him!

01:42:09.715 --> 01:42:12.138
He's talkin' to you.
Answer him.

01:42:12.301 --> 01:42:14.224
- Answer him.
- Frank!

01:42:15.888 --> 01:42:18.186
<i>You're set up!</i>

01:42:50.631 --> 01:42:52.349
Look.

01:42:55.636 --> 01:42:57.354
I said fuckin' look at him.

01:42:57.472 --> 01:42:59.850
Look what happened
to your friend...

01:43:00.016 --> 01:43:03.190
'cause you gotta go
against the way things go down.

01:43:06.606 --> 01:43:10.486
You treat what I tried to do
for you like shit.

01:43:10.610 --> 01:43:13.363
You don't want to work for me.
What's wrong with you?

01:43:15.656 --> 01:43:18.580
And then you carry
a piece in my house.

01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:24.466
You one of those burned-out,
demolished wackos in the joint?

01:43:24.582 --> 01:43:27.461
You're scary,
because you don't give a fuck.

01:43:27.585 --> 01:43:30.338
But don't come on to me now
with your jailhouse bullshit...

01:43:30.463 --> 01:43:32.386
because you are not that guy.

01:43:32.548 --> 01:43:35.222
Don't you get it,
you prick?

01:43:35.384 --> 01:43:37.887
You got a home, car...

01:43:38.012 --> 01:43:39.730
businesses, family...

01:43:39.847 --> 01:43:43.522
and I own the paper
on your whole fuckin' life.

01:43:44.852 --> 01:43:48.231
I'll put your cunt wife on the street
to be fucked in the ass...

01:43:48.356 --> 01:43:50.279
by niggers and Puerto Ricans.

01:43:51.567 --> 01:43:53.911
Your kid's mine
because I bought it.

01:43:55.321 --> 01:43:59.246
You got him on loan. He is leased.
You are renting him.

01:44:00.409 --> 01:44:02.332
I'll whack out your whole family.

01:44:04.163 --> 01:44:08.964
People'll be eating 'em for lunch tomorrow
in their Wimpy burgers and not know it.

01:44:09.085 --> 01:44:11.759
You get paid what I say.

01:44:11.879 --> 01:44:13.802
You do what I say.

01:44:13.923 --> 01:44:16.176
I run you.
There is no discussion.

01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:19.099
I want, you work.
Until you are burned out...

01:44:19.220 --> 01:44:21.314
you are busted, or you're dead.

01:44:22.848 --> 01:44:24.441
You get it?

01:44:25.518 --> 01:44:27.646
You got responsibilities.

01:44:31.190 --> 01:44:33.238
Tighten up and do it.

01:44:34.443 --> 01:44:36.537
Clean this mess up.

01:44:36.654 --> 01:44:38.327
Get him outta here.

01:44:38.447 --> 01:44:40.449
Back to work, Frank.

01:46:10.915 --> 01:46:14.215
Joseph, get over here
right away.

01:46:14.377 --> 01:46:17.130
You're goin' on a trip.

01:46:19.423 --> 01:46:21.016
Frank?

01:46:22.635 --> 01:46:24.433
What?

01:46:24.553 --> 01:46:27.147
Wake up the kid.

01:46:28.766 --> 01:46:30.985
<i>Hmm?</i>

01:46:32.186 --> 01:46:34.029
You're going away.

01:46:37.024 --> 01:46:39.743
<i>It's not what was
supposed to be.</i>

01:46:39.860 --> 01:46:41.783
<i>It can't be this way.</i>

01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:45.408
Don't you understand?

01:46:47.034 --> 01:46:48.911
Hmm-mm.

01:46:56.419 --> 01:46:58.592
Do not take anything.

01:46:58.754 --> 01:47:00.927
Do not pack.
Do it now.

01:47:02.216 --> 01:47:05.220
<i>- Where are we going?</i>
- "We" are not going.

01:47:06.846 --> 01:47:10.476
- You are going.
<i>- Where? What's wrong with you?</i>

01:47:10.599 --> 01:47:12.772
<i>I don't understand.
When are you gonna come?</i>

01:47:12.935 --> 01:47:14.608
I am not.

01:47:16.939 --> 01:47:20.159
You will work out with Joseph
where you're going to go.

01:47:20.276 --> 01:47:23.120
Here is $410,000.

01:47:25.281 --> 01:47:27.500
Wait. We just...

01:47:27.616 --> 01:47:31.337
We just disassemble it
and put it back in a box...

01:47:31.454 --> 01:47:35.459
<i>like an Erector set
you just send back to a store?</i>

01:47:37.585 --> 01:47:40.134
I love you.
I'm not going anywhere.

01:47:41.422 --> 01:47:43.641
You give Joseph 20,000...

01:47:43.799 --> 01:47:45.927
for month number one.

01:47:46.051 --> 01:47:47.974
What are you doing?

01:47:49.054 --> 01:47:51.363
He stays with you a month,
you give him 25,000...

01:47:51.389 --> 01:47:53.050
Doesn't anything mean anything?

01:47:53.142 --> 01:47:55.065
For month number two.

01:47:56.145 --> 01:47:59.615
- I'm your woman. You're my man.
- 30,000 for the third.

01:48:08.532 --> 01:48:11.832
Frank, Frank,
I made a commitment.

01:48:11.994 --> 01:48:15.294
To hell with me, with you...

01:48:15.414 --> 01:48:17.837
with everything.

01:48:21.378 --> 01:48:23.676
I'm throwing you out.

01:48:30.930 --> 01:48:32.807
Get out.

01:48:40.856 --> 01:48:42.608
Get out.

01:48:51.408 --> 01:48:53.035
Get out!

01:49:09.051 --> 01:49:11.554
<i>Frank?</i>

01:54:36.044 --> 01:54:38.297
You want some milk?

01:54:38.422 --> 01:54:40.390
No, I'm okay.

01:58:17.349 --> 01:58:19.101
Aah!
