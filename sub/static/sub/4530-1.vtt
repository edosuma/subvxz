00:33.408 --> 00:35.183
Praise be to the God,

00:35.283 --> 00:38.683
and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:38.783 --> 00:43.367
the Father of compassion
and the God of all comforts,

00:43.492 --> 00:47.308
who comforts us
through all our afflictions

00:47.408 --> 00:50.450
so that we can comfort those
in any afflictions...

00:54.283 --> 00:57.408
We come together today
to say farewell...

01:14.200 --> 01:16.533
Shut up, fucking pedophile.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.950
She did her best to be there
for all those in her life.

01:26.367 --> 01:29.992
Her son, her family. Her friends.

01:30.117 --> 01:32.183
Sometimes this meant forgetting
about her own...

01:32.283 --> 01:34.658
Cunt-licking fucking faggot!

01:36.158 --> 01:38.950
You dye your hairy pubes ginger.

01:53.533 --> 01:55.616
Fuck, fuck!

02:03.533 --> 02:08.699
Fuck-ing... Fucking cunt fucking faggot!

02:39.033 --> 02:41.075
Cunt.

03:06.033 --> 03:09.366
- Are you packed?
- Hey, Dad? This picture?

03:10.700 --> 03:14.450
- Where were you guys?
- California.

03:15.241 --> 03:19.200
- Where in California?
- Why does it matter?

03:19.325 --> 03:22.491
Mom wanted you to take her there again.

03:33.741 --> 03:35.600
She was laughin'.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.241
Yeah.

03:42.116 --> 03:45.100
Will you... move back in?

03:45.200 --> 03:47.641
Fuck... fucking cunt.

03:47.741 --> 03:49.808
With Monica?

03:49.908 --> 03:52.116
We're going to sell the house.

04:01.575 --> 04:02.825
Why is this packed?

04:03.408 --> 04:06.033
- Because I was going to take her.
- Where?

04:06.408 --> 04:08.475
- The ocean.
- You can't be serious.

04:08.575 --> 04:10.100
Well, you weren't here.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.491
Cunt. Yes, so the two of us
were going to go.

04:12.616 --> 04:15.850
- The two of you, the dynamic duo.
- I took care of her!

04:15.950 --> 04:18.241
You held her hand
while she drank herself to death.

04:18.533 --> 04:21.408
You... go fuck...

04:21.533 --> 04:23.366
Fuck, fucking cu...

04:34.783 --> 04:38.491
I'm not as... helpless as you think.

04:40.158 --> 04:41.450
You want to go to the ocean?

04:43.491 --> 04:45.366
You can't even get to 7-11.

04:46.533 --> 04:48.075
Fuck you.

04:48.200 --> 04:51.933
- Be packed and ready to go in 20 minutes.
- I am not going into a hospital.

04:52.033 --> 04:57.325
It's not a hospital.
It's an experimental treatment center.

05:02.616 --> 05:05.700
Your campaign balloons! Get that one.

05:05.825 --> 05:09.908
- Let it go. Free advertisement.
- There.

05:12.700 --> 05:15.533
We'll see you at Christmas, okay?

05:35.783 --> 05:37.574
Call you later.

05:37.699 --> 05:39.574
Okay.

05:54.491 --> 05:56.533
Tourette's isn't something you can cure.

05:57.366 --> 06:00.199
But with behavioral exercises,
you can learn to manage it.

06:00.533 --> 06:03.866
It's great, it's great.
Ain't that great, Vincent?

06:07.116 --> 06:10.641
Mr. Rhodes, do you mind if I have
a little chat with Vincent?

06:10.741 --> 06:13.158
No, not at all.

06:14.741 --> 06:16.949
Alone.

06:21.408 --> 06:23.658
All right.

06:31.574 --> 06:34.116
Mind if I... sit?

06:39.824 --> 06:42.366
Would you like to ask me anything?

06:43.533 --> 06:45.366
Nope.

06:46.241 --> 06:48.241
Okay, I got some questions.

06:48.366 --> 06:52.074
- Your mother was your primary...
- Look, you said you can help me.

06:53.658 --> 06:55.033
So what can you do?

06:55.991 --> 06:57.724
What kind of drugs have you tried?

06:57.824 --> 07:01.324
Amy Winehouse sucks my cock.

07:04.866 --> 07:09.033
Everything. Everything.
Nothing has worked.

07:10.741 --> 07:13.449
Cunt. Cunt.

07:16.616 --> 07:19.241
What would you do if you
could better control your tics?

07:19.908 --> 07:22.991
- It's never really mattered.
- Matters now.

07:28.658 --> 07:30.908
I don't know. A lot.

07:31.116 --> 07:33.658
Anything more concrete?

07:39.408 --> 07:41.683
Graduate from...

07:41.783 --> 07:44.158
high school.

07:45.741 --> 07:48.324
Maybe go to college.

07:50.741 --> 07:53.116
Then let's try this.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.533
Okay?

08:05.116 --> 08:06.533
Christmas.

08:06.866 --> 08:08.741
Yeah.

08:12.574 --> 08:15.908
I think it's best for you to have
a roommate. Not to be alone.

08:16.033 --> 08:18.366
At first, anyway.

08:19.366 --> 08:22.408
Oh, I forgot. Do you have a cell phone?

08:22.533 --> 08:25.474
No. Yes, I do! No, I don't.

08:25.574 --> 08:28.783
Okay, don't get one.
It's against the rules.

08:29.366 --> 08:31.974
Anyway. Your roommate's name is Alex.

08:32.073 --> 08:36.099
He's a wonderful young man.
He's come to us from very far away.

08:36.198 --> 08:39.198
Because, like you,
he just wants to get better.

08:40.366 --> 08:42.741
- Alex?
- No.

08:44.574 --> 08:47.157
I didn't say you could come in.

08:51.866 --> 08:54.849
Take your shoes off! Take them off.

08:54.949 --> 08:56.532
I have to start all over again now.

08:56.949 --> 09:00.599
These are my inside shoes.
I promise you there's no germs on them.

09:00.699 --> 09:04.199
What about his? His shoes are befouled.

09:04.324 --> 09:06.932
Well, a perfect opportunity
for a behavioral exercise.

09:07.032 --> 09:09.532
I don't want to do
a behavioral exercise!

09:09.741 --> 09:11.307
I want him and his filthy feet
out of here.

09:11.407 --> 09:14.907
In one of these exercises,
I operate as if there's nothing wrong

09:15.032 --> 09:18.141
so that Alex can see
that there isn't anything wrong.

09:18.241 --> 09:20.907
Alex? This is Vincent.
He's gonna be your roommate for awhile.

09:21.407 --> 09:23.366
- Hi.
- Absolutely not.

09:23.657 --> 09:26.657
If you need me for anything,
you just come find me, okay?

09:27.157 --> 09:28.741
I don't want a roommate.

09:28.866 --> 09:31.807
Just get settled in,
and if nothing else comes up for today,

09:31.907 --> 09:34.741
I will see you bright and early
tomorrow morning at group.

09:34.866 --> 09:36.866
You too.

09:50.199 --> 09:53.616
It's... classical?

09:55.949 --> 09:58.199
It's Bach.

09:59.449 --> 10:00.866
It's nice.

10:01.241 --> 10:04.516
It's Bach. It's Bach.

10:04.616 --> 10:06.532
It's Bach, it's Bach.

10:15.574 --> 10:19.016
- Hey, there is...
- No, no. Don't touch those.

10:19.116 --> 10:21.849
In fact, don't come over
to this side of the room.

10:21.949 --> 10:25.741
This is my bed, my desk,
and my wardrobe.

10:26.366 --> 10:30.407
Everything on that side can be yours
but you do not cross this line, understood?

10:30.532 --> 10:32.116
All right.

10:36.741 --> 10:37.866
What's wrong with you?

10:43.699 --> 10:45.616
Why are you here?

10:45.741 --> 10:47.907
Me? I...

10:48.032 --> 10:50.866
Raghead fuck. Raghead!

10:52.032 --> 10:55.199
She can't be serious.
She simply cannot be serious.

10:55.324 --> 10:56.932
Dr. Rose!

10:57.032 --> 10:59.032
- Fuck.
- Dr. Rose.

10:59.657 --> 11:02.866
Raghead. I'm sorry.

11:06.282 --> 11:09.199
I'm sorry. Clean freak. Clean freak.

11:11.866 --> 11:13.907
Fuck.

11:15.741 --> 11:18.032
And I'm British, you imbecile.

11:46.282 --> 11:48.032
They'll kick you out for that.

11:50.282 --> 11:51.782
What, pot?

11:52.116 --> 11:55.907
No. No.

11:56.782 --> 11:58.182
Whatever.

11:58.282 --> 12:00.907
I'm Marie. I'm supposed
to show you around the clinic.

12:01.032 --> 12:03.907
So, let's get it over with.

12:05.032 --> 12:06.932
Move.

12:07.032 --> 12:08.991
What, no mask today?

12:09.116 --> 12:11.699
Have you gained weight?
Your ass looks fat.

12:13.782 --> 12:15.865
Come on.

12:21.657 --> 12:23.615
There's one main rule
here at the clinic.

12:23.740 --> 12:26.282
We have to want it.

12:27.449 --> 12:32.740
- What are you doing?
- Just... sneezing. I had to sneeze.

12:33.532 --> 12:35.765
So if they catch you
with any alcohol or drugs,

12:35.865 --> 12:38.682
they take it to mean you're not serious
about your therapy, and you're out.

12:38.782 --> 12:42.949
So just be careful with whatever
it is you have hidden.

12:43.074 --> 12:45.765
Over there is Building B,
mostly depressives and suicidees.

12:45.865 --> 12:48.224
So, stay clear of that.

12:48.324 --> 12:50.890
- Hey, hey, hey! Fuck you.
- Excuse me?

12:50.990 --> 12:54.199
Suck my dick. I don't mean it. I'm...

12:55.449 --> 12:57.782
It's Tourette's. Cunt.

12:58.574 --> 13:00.265
We had one like you before.

13:00.365 --> 13:03.115
He had a little loop in his pants
to keep his hands in.

13:03.240 --> 13:07.365
At one point he had two of them.
Looked like a goddamn penguin.

13:08.949 --> 13:11.782
Computer room but the Internet blows.

13:12.199 --> 13:14.907
TV room, no cable.

13:15.615 --> 13:18.224
Game room but they're all stupid.

13:18.324 --> 13:22.782
And finally,
the sweet smell of gourmet shit.

13:23.865 --> 13:25.949
That's pretty much it.

13:26.074 --> 13:27.824
Any questions?

13:27.949 --> 13:32.824
Fuck you, fatty. I'm... I'm sorry.

13:32.949 --> 13:37.449
- Thank you for the... tour.
- It was a punishment.

13:40.782 --> 13:43.865
Behavioral exercise.

13:53.657 --> 13:55.949
I'm sorry.

13:56.949 --> 13:59.724
- You have no idea what you're talking about.
- Alex, you have got to stop.

13:59.824 --> 14:01.324
I think... I think
you might need glasses.

14:01.449 --> 14:05.224
Seriously, Alex, you are trying
my patience today. Enough.

14:05.324 --> 14:07.990
You're wrong.
I was taking the bottle out.

14:08.115 --> 14:11.032
I saw you putting it in.

14:13.532 --> 14:17.615
- I barely touched you, Alex.
- I don't know where your hands have been.

14:21.949 --> 14:23.432
You must be Vincent.

14:23.532 --> 14:26.365
- Yeah.
- He said he found that in your bag?

14:27.449 --> 14:28.432
I don't...

14:28.532 --> 14:31.057
That's what I thought.
I'll get someone to clean it up.

14:31.157 --> 14:35.282
And nice try, Alex. But you are getting
a roommate whether you like it or not.

14:48.490 --> 14:52.032
- Thanks a lot.
- What did I do?

14:52.449 --> 14:55.849
I don't want you here. I want you gone,
you addle-brained freak.

14:55.949 --> 14:57.907
Fuck...

15:00.407 --> 15:03.115
Cunt. Cunt.

15:03.699 --> 15:05.532
Fuck.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.282
Cunt.

15:10.282 --> 15:13.449
I need to get in there.
I still have soap on my hands.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.449
- Tough!
- You better not be going to the bathroom.

15:17.574 --> 15:19.240
You have to go to the one
down the hall for that.

15:19.740 --> 15:23.532
- Leave me alone.
- I'm serious, do not use that toilet.

15:24.032 --> 15:25.907
Fuck.

15:30.032 --> 15:32.407
Oh, my God!

15:55.407 --> 15:57.532
You wanking?

16:02.782 --> 16:05.948
I told you not to mess with these.

16:23.907 --> 16:28.032
Can you... can you turn on the music?

16:29.573 --> 16:31.573
Please?

17:09.948 --> 17:11.365
Mind if I...

17:19.615 --> 17:21.781
I'm not...

17:22.281 --> 17:25.656
interested in men in case
that's what Dr. Rose told you.

17:27.781 --> 17:29.823
She didn't.

17:49.407 --> 17:50.532
Fuck!

17:51.032 --> 17:53.115
That's disgusting.

17:53.323 --> 17:55.448
- I'm sorry.
- Alex?

17:55.948 --> 17:57.448
That was in your mouth.

17:58.115 --> 17:59.598
What's going on?

17:59.698 --> 18:02.740
- He spat his food on me.
- Okay, that is disgusting.

18:03.115 --> 18:06.932
He's contaminated me.
I'm going to get sick now.

18:07.032 --> 18:09.890
Who does that? Who spits their food out?

18:09.990 --> 18:11.823
Now I'm going to have
to go and change now.

18:11.948 --> 18:13.948
I'm...

18:20.532 --> 18:23.240
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.

18:29.865 --> 18:32.490
- Done.
- Really?

18:32.782 --> 18:34.573
Well, then you can go.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.532
Missed.

18:55.948 --> 18:57.990
Fuck.

19:02.573 --> 19:04.948
Holy moly, boobs.

19:14.781 --> 19:18.281
Can't they... can't they
see you from in there?

19:24.781 --> 19:27.615
- No.
- It helps.

19:28.031 --> 19:29.573
Helps with what?

19:31.198 --> 19:33.448
Everything.

19:40.365 --> 19:42.931
So do you know
when you're going to spasm?

19:43.031 --> 19:45.073
Yeah.

19:47.865 --> 19:50.223
What's it feel like?

19:50.323 --> 19:54.531
It builds... like
when you have to sneeze.

19:54.823 --> 19:57.098
Can you make it stop?

19:57.198 --> 19:59.573
Can you stop yourself from sneezing?

20:01.781 --> 20:03.281
Good point.

20:14.448 --> 20:16.323
Fuck, gross. Kiss.

20:30.323 --> 20:32.531
Turn that off.

20:32.823 --> 20:35.990
Little shits. Fuck off.

20:36.115 --> 20:38.156
Turn that off.

20:39.490 --> 20:41.115
Come on.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.156
Turn it off. Get back here.

20:44.573 --> 20:48.698
- Give it to me. Give it to me.
- Are you kidding? This shit's going viral.

20:49.490 --> 20:50.931
Why don't you come and get it?

20:51.031 --> 20:52.890
- Vincent, come on.
- Get off.

20:52.990 --> 20:55.490
Tony, he's spazzing.

20:56.573 --> 20:57.948
Vincent.

21:02.615 --> 21:04.531
Get off him. He's a fucking kid.

21:08.448 --> 21:10.073
You're hurting him!

21:15.740 --> 21:18.181
As if we don't have enough problems
with this community.

21:18.281 --> 21:20.573
- He didn't do anything.
- I didn't ask you.

21:21.073 --> 21:23.615
Well, you weren't there. Okay? We were.

21:32.781 --> 21:34.056
Hey.

21:34.156 --> 21:37.990
It's okay. Just leave it, please.
Sorry. Thank you.

21:42.448 --> 21:44.681
Can I have one?

21:44.781 --> 21:46.823
Please?

21:58.115 --> 21:59.281
Thank you.

22:01.323 --> 22:02.931
Vincent, would you please
leave us alone for a minute?

22:03.031 --> 22:06.573
I need to talk to Marie
about her little stunt in the lunch room.

22:08.740 --> 22:10.323
Yeah.

22:29.865 --> 22:31.906
So...

22:32.281 --> 22:35.156
if you could go anywhere in the world...

22:35.615 --> 22:37.781
where would you go?

22:43.948 --> 22:45.989
The ocean.

23:33.281 --> 23:35.681
- Here.
- You drive. I don't really like to.

23:35.781 --> 23:37.698
Why not?

23:39.073 --> 23:41.198
Good point.

23:55.239 --> 23:56.431
- Stop!
- Hey, watch out.

23:56.531 --> 23:58.073
Stop.

24:00.864 --> 24:02.823
Give me back my Bach.

24:02.948 --> 24:06.031
- Your what? What is he talking about?
- My CD, you idiot.

24:06.156 --> 24:08.823
If you scratched it,
I'll have you arrested.

24:09.823 --> 24:13.198
Can you give it back to him, please?
So Dumbo here can fly away.

24:16.406 --> 24:17.823
Is that Dr. Rose's car?

24:18.989 --> 24:20.656
Yeah, she...

24:20.948 --> 24:23.948
- We were supposed to get her something.
- She lent it to us.

24:24.281 --> 24:26.614
She lent it to us so we can
go get her something.

24:26.739 --> 24:28.239
Lying pig.

24:31.614 --> 24:33.698
Okay.

24:38.239 --> 24:40.989
And I'm sure it won't be a problem
if I just go ask her about it then?

24:41.114 --> 24:42.614
Shit.

24:42.739 --> 24:44.448
You're definitely out of my room now.

24:49.281 --> 24:51.098
- No, let me go.
- Shut up, Alex. Shut up.

24:51.198 --> 24:53.698
- Don't touch me, you spastic.
- What should we do?

24:55.198 --> 24:57.264
Shut up.

24:57.364 --> 24:59.864
Alex, would you shut up?

25:00.906 --> 25:02.906
No, no, no.

25:09.781 --> 25:13.848
I don't want to go. Turn the car around.
This car reeks of cigarettes!

25:13.948 --> 25:16.323
We can probably take the back roads
in case they come looking for us.

25:16.448 --> 25:19.056
Only the main streets
are shown on this map.

25:19.156 --> 25:23.948
Oh, I guess, I don't know,
we should just go south?

25:24.073 --> 25:25.848
You guys don't even have a plan.

25:25.948 --> 25:28.223
Don't you know a kidnapping
must be carefully planned?

25:28.323 --> 25:31.223
What... Since... Nobody wants you here.
It's a little extreme...

25:31.323 --> 25:35.098
fuckity fuck-ass...
to call it a kidnapping.

25:35.198 --> 25:37.364
He's got a point.

25:47.156 --> 25:49.431
- I don't like it, I don't like it.
- You like it?

25:49.531 --> 25:51.889
- It's too loud right now. It's too loud.
- You want me to turn it up?

25:51.989 --> 25:53.448
Turn it up.

25:53.573 --> 25:56.014
- Is this loud enough?
- This is noise pollution.

25:56.114 --> 25:59.223
I'm trying to turn it up,
but this is as loud as it goes.

25:59.323 --> 26:01.198
Yipe!

26:02.323 --> 26:05.198
Holy shit, we're out
of that fucking place.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.906
He's still there.

26:40.239 --> 26:41.947
Good morning, sunshine.

26:44.614 --> 26:47.197
So where are you and the incredibly
shrinking woman headed?

26:50.447 --> 26:52.114
California.

26:53.614 --> 26:55.264
What for?

26:55.364 --> 26:57.989
So Vincent can go to the beach.

26:58.322 --> 27:00.197
Swim in the ocean.

27:01.114 --> 27:03.531
I've been to the ocean.

27:03.822 --> 27:08.347
- It's filled with... excrement.
- Then go back to the fucking clinic, Alex.

27:08.447 --> 27:12.406
Doctors eat shit sandwiches on Tuesdays.

27:21.364 --> 27:24.406
The backseat is full crumbs.
I want shotgun.

27:38.281 --> 27:40.864
Could you pull your seat forward?

27:42.281 --> 27:44.864
- Alex.
- You have to pull the lever.

27:45.489 --> 27:48.447
- Just fucking touch it. Jesus Christ!
- Roll the thing on the side of the seat.

27:54.781 --> 27:56.972
- Bob Rhodes.
- <i>Hi, this is Dr. Rose.</i>

27:57.072 --> 27:58.447
- <i>We have a situation.</i>
- What's the matter?

27:58.572 --> 28:00.322
<i>I need you to come
to the clinic right away.</i>

28:00.447 --> 28:02.389
Now? I'm a little busy.

28:02.489 --> 28:04.947
<i>Well, it's important
because your son's gone.</i>

28:05.072 --> 28:08.556
- What do you mean, gone?
- Gone. He left.

28:08.656 --> 28:10.739
Give me a minute.

28:14.572 --> 28:16.447
- When?
- Some time during the night.

28:16.572 --> 28:18.697
He and two other patients are missing.

28:19.114 --> 28:23.947
- Listen, I'm about to give a campaign...
- He stole my car.

28:32.114 --> 28:34.931
Okay, and the gas is...

28:35.031 --> 28:37.239
Saab.

28:40.614 --> 28:42.614
Sorry.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.156
I got a gun.

28:45.281 --> 28:48.781
- That's not funny, asshole.
- I'm sorry.

28:55.072 --> 28:57.406
And this shit ain't no good, man.

28:59.989 --> 29:02.656
It has to work. Could you...
could you try it again...

29:02.781 --> 29:05.406
Poligrip denture cream.

29:07.281 --> 29:09.906
I'll... I'll be right back.

29:11.531 --> 29:12.781
How you doin'?

29:13.281 --> 29:15.597
- Marie?
- Yeah?

29:15.697 --> 29:17.389
My...

29:17.489 --> 29:19.972
- My card isn't working.
- Shit.

29:20.072 --> 29:22.614
Yeah, and I have, like, a few dollars
in cash. Do you have anything?

29:22.739 --> 29:26.889
- No, nothing.
- You came on this trip with no money?

29:26.989 --> 29:31.722
You can thank Dr. Rose for that.
She thinks no money equals no accidents.

29:31.822 --> 29:34.056
Fuck. Great.

29:34.156 --> 29:36.906
Alex? You got any money?

29:38.072 --> 29:40.531
- In my pajama pockets?
- Spear-chucker cunt.

29:41.447 --> 29:44.305
Are you incognizant?
I'm British, not Pakistani,

29:44.405 --> 29:47.764
- not Native American, British.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

29:47.864 --> 29:50.405
What the fuck are we going to do now?

29:55.364 --> 29:57.180
What the fuck?

29:57.280 --> 29:59.030
Alex.

29:59.447 --> 30:00.447
Open the door.

30:00.780 --> 30:03.947
- I'm going home and filing charges.
- You left the keys in the ignition?

30:04.072 --> 30:06.530
How was I supposed to know Mr. Clean
was going to try and ditch us?

30:13.780 --> 30:16.364
You touched the gas nozzle! Car! Cunt.

30:16.489 --> 30:19.655
Guys? Could you open the door?
The fucking guy's coming.

30:19.947 --> 30:22.972
- What the hell are you guys doing?
- Alex, drive.

30:23.072 --> 30:24.822
Give me a moment.
I haven't driven in a long time.

30:24.947 --> 30:27.764
- You owe me for that gas.
- I'm going to fucking kill you. Just go.

30:27.864 --> 30:30.822
- I can't. It's not right yet.
- It's not about being right, just go.

30:30.947 --> 30:32.264
Get out of the car, now!

30:32.364 --> 30:34.280
- Put your foot...
- Hands off!

30:34.780 --> 30:37.572
- Get out of this damn car.
- Gas would be good right about now.

30:37.947 --> 30:40.530
- Get out of the car!
- Gas!

30:41.030 --> 30:43.197
- Where are you going?
- You ain't going to rob me,

30:43.322 --> 30:47.764
you little asshole! You stupid punks!

30:47.864 --> 30:50.947
I'll break your ass if I catch you.

30:51.447 --> 30:54.514
- Alex, you are such an asshole.
- Don't touch me whilst I'm driving.

30:54.614 --> 30:59.697
Just stop... stop the car now!
The windshield wipers are on!

31:03.947 --> 31:06.072
- Fuck!
- This is my space, okay?

31:06.280 --> 31:07.764
You stay over there
with your nozzle hands,

31:07.864 --> 31:09.847
and you stay back there
with all those disgusting crumbs.

31:09.947 --> 31:12.905
You don't get to tell us what to do.
I'm in charge here.

31:13.030 --> 31:15.597
- Not you, you cunt.
- Are you calling me a cunt?

31:15.697 --> 31:19.697
- That was his Tourette's, you idiot.
- No, I said that on purpose.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.947
What's so... What's so funny?

31:26.072 --> 31:28.572
Nothing. Sorry.

31:32.280 --> 31:35.264
It's just... it's hard to tell where you stop
and your Tourette's begins.

31:35.364 --> 31:39.197
It's not funny. Assholes.

31:41.655 --> 31:44.364
You guys are fucking idiots.

31:52.114 --> 31:55.180
- Left. Right! I mean left!
- Stop yelling.

31:55.280 --> 31:58.322
I know you're experimental,
but the prices you charge,

31:58.447 --> 32:00.722
I expected you to at least
keep tabs on my son.

32:00.822 --> 32:03.280
Your son is an adult.
He can leave any time he wants.

32:03.405 --> 32:06.055
He doesn't have to ask permission
from me or you to do so.

32:06.155 --> 32:09.489
What about your car? Shouldn't he
have asked for permission for that?

32:10.114 --> 32:11.889
Here are Vincent's things.

32:11.989 --> 32:15.555
I think what's happening
is that your son is in shock.

32:15.655 --> 32:18.780
The only person who he had
any real relationship with has just died.

32:18.905 --> 32:22.280
He's not in shock.
He's just doing this to piss me off.

32:22.989 --> 32:27.264
I'm not playing this little game with him.
I put a hold on his bank account.

32:27.364 --> 32:29.822
What? They need money to buy food.

32:29.947 --> 32:33.239
And when they can't buy it,
they'll come back here.

32:35.197 --> 32:37.555
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, this is Officer... calling.</i>

32:37.655 --> 32:41.114
- What can I do for you, officer?
- <i>Dark green Saab 9-3?</i>

32:41.239 --> 32:43.572
Yes, that's my car.

32:44.572 --> 32:48.597
- This gets out, I'm ruined.
- Your compassion is outstanding.

32:48.697 --> 32:51.597
You should be just as worried
about this as I am.

32:51.697 --> 32:53.655
I'll call you in a bit to let you know
what's going on.

32:53.780 --> 32:58.280
Excuse me, those are my patients.
You're not... You're not leaving without me.

32:58.655 --> 33:02.764
- Does your car have LoJack?
- It's a 1999 Saab.

33:02.864 --> 33:05.222
Are you sure you're a real doctor?

33:05.322 --> 33:09.139
Would you prefer your money go into my
bank account rather into your son's care?

33:09.239 --> 33:12.530
What care? He's gone.

33:17.447 --> 33:19.430
So let's think.

33:19.530 --> 33:22.155
Where could they be?

33:23.572 --> 33:25.638
They have to eat.

33:25.738 --> 33:28.555
- What are you doing?
- Looking to see if there's a Subway restaurant

33:28.655 --> 33:30.888
- near that gas station.
- Subway?

33:30.988 --> 33:33.863
That's the only place Alex will eat
because they wear gloves.

33:34.947 --> 33:37.222
You realize this is pointless?
They can be anywhere by now.

33:37.322 --> 33:39.405
- No, they can't.
- Why not?

33:39.988 --> 33:42.613
Because it's raining.

33:48.322 --> 33:51.155
That's the highest setting.

33:52.988 --> 33:55.988
But I can make it slower, if you like.

34:15.155 --> 34:17.987
- Put that out.
- Make me.

34:19.237 --> 34:22.612
- Hey, how much money do we have left?
- Like, six dollars.

34:22.737 --> 34:25.947
- Marie can live off that for a week.
- Will you leave her alone?

34:28.197 --> 34:30.447
Would you like a...

34:30.572 --> 34:32.822
A bite of my sandwich?

34:32.947 --> 34:34.179
No thanks.

34:34.280 --> 34:37.013
Maybe my... fatty.

34:37.112 --> 34:38.947
Sorry.

34:39.072 --> 34:42.030
- Maybe my chips?
- No.

34:47.072 --> 34:50.530
- Pickle?
- Jesus fucking Christ, leave me alone.

34:50.737 --> 34:52.987
All right, all right.

34:53.112 --> 34:55.197
- You have got to be kidding.
- What?

34:55.322 --> 34:57.305
- Clean that up!
- Fuck.

34:57.405 --> 35:01.263
Wipe your hands before you touch
everything with those greasy fingers.

35:01.363 --> 35:03.947
- And all the yelling and smoking...
- Hey!

35:04.072 --> 35:06.697
...shall henceforth take place
outside of the car.

35:06.822 --> 35:10.530
- Alex. Fuck. Oi, fuck.
- I said out!

35:16.738 --> 35:19.363
Fuck. Fuck.

35:34.863 --> 35:36.030
Come on!

35:41.322 --> 35:42.238
Shit.

35:43.947 --> 35:46.363
Oh, fuck.

35:53.863 --> 35:57.988
Don't mind him. He really does
have a fucking stick up his ass.

36:01.447 --> 36:03.613
Hey, what's in the can?

36:07.572 --> 36:09.780
My mother.

36:14.947 --> 36:16.947
She's the one that needs
to go to the ocean?

36:59.571 --> 37:01.488
Shit.

37:11.363 --> 37:12.763
Where's Marie?

37:12.863 --> 37:17.113
Peeing. Puking. I don't know.

37:20.821 --> 37:24.613
Holy Tin Man wants a heart.

37:37.446 --> 37:39.446
This is ridiculous.

37:39.571 --> 37:42.596
That guy said they asked
about a lake, right?

37:42.696 --> 37:44.821
And this being the only lake
in this shit town,

37:44.946 --> 37:48.113
I suppose they gotta be somewhere
around here, right?

37:48.238 --> 37:50.405
It stopped raining 30 minutes ago.
They're gone.

37:54.238 --> 37:56.446
Five missed calls, shit.

38:00.655 --> 38:02.571
Oh, my God.

38:04.571 --> 38:07.405
- What?
- It's them.

38:08.280 --> 38:11.930
Okay, okay. Now let's just
approach them calmly and quietly.

38:12.030 --> 38:14.030
- Vincent!
- Or not.

38:14.321 --> 38:16.280
Vincent!

38:16.405 --> 38:18.446
- Vincent.
- Alex?

38:18.821 --> 38:20.780
- Dr. Rose?
- Dad?

38:21.446 --> 38:24.988
- Get over here, now!
- What now?

38:25.280 --> 38:26.863
Vincent, get over here.

38:27.571 --> 38:29.280
Kiss my ass.

38:30.071 --> 38:33.821
- Now he's just fucking with me.
- Calm down.

38:34.113 --> 38:36.530
Where's Marie?

38:36.655 --> 38:38.113
What are you doing?

38:39.238 --> 38:41.388
Marie. Shit.

38:41.488 --> 38:43.405
Marie. Marie.

38:46.780 --> 38:49.780
Marie? Where are you?

38:50.196 --> 38:51.263
- We have to go.
- What?

38:51.363 --> 38:53.155
- We have to go.
- Okay. What's going on?

38:53.280 --> 38:54.930
My fucking dad.

38:55.030 --> 38:57.263
Alex, get in the car.

38:57.363 --> 39:00.030
Alex, get in the fucking car.

39:01.405 --> 39:03.405
Alex!

39:20.071 --> 39:21.846
Get out.

39:21.946 --> 39:25.238
- Now.
- Don't touch me.

39:38.321 --> 39:40.763
Where are your things?

39:40.863 --> 39:42.988
Fuck... in the... cunt.

39:43.696 --> 39:45.363
Fuck.

39:48.530 --> 39:51.071
Let's go. Get out there.

39:52.946 --> 39:55.488
I try to be the nice guy,
and this is the thanks I get.

39:56.196 --> 39:57.780
Are you okay?

39:57.905 --> 39:59.946
I think.

40:01.446 --> 40:02.680
Have you had anything to drink?

40:02.780 --> 40:05.946
That's a great thing about you.
I can always count on you to fail.

40:06.071 --> 40:08.113
That's...

40:08.238 --> 40:11.221
- Yes?
- That's... That's not...

40:11.321 --> 40:12.763
Fuck... Not...

40:12.863 --> 40:15.279
See, you can't even finish
that sentence.

40:15.404 --> 40:17.404
Get in.

40:23.529 --> 40:25.654
Vincent!

40:35.613 --> 40:38.013
- Hey, stop!
- What?

40:38.113 --> 40:40.613
Where do you think you're going?
You're just going to leave us standing here?

40:40.988 --> 40:44.654
- You have a car.
- But I don't have my phone.

40:46.404 --> 40:48.554
Your phone.

40:48.654 --> 40:51.404
Your phone.

40:56.154 --> 40:58.071
Fuck.

40:59.029 --> 41:01.904
Here's your goddamn phone.

41:04.279 --> 41:05.679
Hey!

41:05.779 --> 41:07.821
Next time...

41:09.613 --> 41:11.513
don't give me a roommate.

41:11.613 --> 41:13.654
Alex!

41:14.279 --> 41:17.363
- Wait! Wait.
- Alex, come on.

41:19.113 --> 41:20.571
- Come on.
- Piss hands, piss hands.

41:20.696 --> 41:23.529
Okay, okay. Just get in the fucking car.

41:24.988 --> 41:27.763
- We did it.
- The car is so clean.

41:27.863 --> 41:29.821
And no cigarette smell.
I like your father.

41:29.946 --> 41:33.054
- Well, you can... Have him.
- I like him, I like him.

41:33.154 --> 41:36.221
- We're gonna crash.
- Vincent.

41:36.321 --> 41:38.304
- We're gonna crash.
- What are you doing?

41:38.404 --> 41:41.513
- Vincent, stop ticcing. Stop ticcing.
- We're heading off the road.

41:41.613 --> 41:44.613
Shit. Stop, Vincent.

41:49.488 --> 41:52.446
You guys thought I was a bad driver.

41:53.446 --> 41:57.096
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

41:57.196 --> 41:59.613
Sweet Fanny Adams.

42:00.446 --> 42:02.404
I'll let you drive.

42:10.779 --> 42:13.154
Vincent's running away
now makes complete sense.

42:13.446 --> 42:16.154
- Mind your own damn business.
- I am.

42:16.279 --> 42:18.279
That young woman is sick
and needs to eat.

42:18.988 --> 42:21.513
Yeah, well, I was supposed
to give a speech three hours ago,

42:21.613 --> 42:23.696
and instead I'm in the middle
of a lake looking for froggy keys

42:23.821 --> 42:26.404
with a shitty doctor
who's less capable than my son.

42:26.779 --> 42:28.154
Now you're projecting.

42:28.279 --> 42:29.946
- What?
- Projecting.

42:30.071 --> 42:33.863
Calling me a shitty doctor to make up
for the fact that you're a shitty father.

42:34.446 --> 42:38.529
Oh, yeah, you got me figured out? Too bad
I was paying you to figure out Vincent.

42:49.238 --> 42:51.779
This is ridiculous.

42:52.613 --> 42:54.279
I'm calling Triple A.

42:54.988 --> 42:57.279
- MBrace.
- What?

42:57.404 --> 42:59.446
- My car has MBrace.
- Good for you.

42:59.571 --> 43:03.154
No, you peasant.
It means I can track it with my phone.

43:03.279 --> 43:07.904
My phone. My phone.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

43:08.029 --> 43:10.613
Now what? I left my phone in the car.

43:10.738 --> 43:14.221
- The car's right there.
- My car.

43:14.321 --> 43:16.763
<i>Please say your destination.</i>

43:16.863 --> 43:19.446
- The ocean.
- <i>Location not found.</i>

43:19.571 --> 43:22.054
You can't just say ocean. You have to
tell it the name by the name of the beach.

43:22.154 --> 43:24.721
- I don't know the name.
- Why doesn't that surprise me?

43:24.821 --> 43:28.179
- Okay, what's a city near a beach?
- Los Angeles.

43:28.279 --> 43:31.721
- <i>Destination Los Angeles.</i>
- No. No, we're not going to Los Angeles.

43:31.821 --> 43:34.113
That place is a cesspool
of communicable diseases.

43:34.238 --> 43:37.721
- Colon cancer rots your ass hole.
- There are closer beaches, anyway.

43:37.821 --> 43:41.279
What about San Francisco?

43:42.612 --> 43:45.362
- You would say that.
- Shut up.

43:45.487 --> 43:49.096
Shut up? Really?
Why don't you make me shut up, Alex?

43:49.196 --> 43:51.279
Oh, wait, that means
you have to touch me.

43:51.404 --> 43:53.387
Touch those repulsive bird arms,
no thank you.

43:53.487 --> 43:56.737
Oh, I'm a bird? I'm a little baby bird?

43:58.654 --> 44:02.946
- Get away from me, I'm driving.
- Somebody tell it where the fuck we're going.

44:03.571 --> 44:06.362
I don't know, fuck it, I've been
to Santa Cruz. Let's just go there.

44:12.071 --> 44:15.071
- What the hell?
- Hell is for horses.

44:21.779 --> 44:23.029
What the fuck?

44:26.279 --> 44:30.262
- Alex, what is happening right now?
- The car. I felt it run over something.

44:30.362 --> 44:34.054
It was a person. Sweet Fanny Adams,
I don't want to go to prison.

44:34.154 --> 44:36.721
Wow, you are way more fucked up
than I thought you were.

44:36.821 --> 44:40.179
Alex. Stop. You didn't run over anyone.

44:40.279 --> 44:43.762
- It was... It was a pothole.
- No, I'm sure I did, and I...

44:43.862 --> 44:45.946
Probably a pregnant woman,
and I killed the baby, too.

44:46.071 --> 44:50.262
No. No, no, no. You didn't kill anyone.

44:50.362 --> 44:55.071
- No pregnant lady. No baby.
- Just shut up and look around for a body.

44:56.362 --> 44:58.362
Come on.

45:02.946 --> 45:05.096
I don't see a dead body.

45:05.196 --> 45:07.571
No. Not over here either.

45:11.196 --> 45:13.237
Oh, my God.

45:14.362 --> 45:15.446
There it is.

45:18.862 --> 45:20.779
Where?

45:21.612 --> 45:24.487
- Where?
- Over there.

45:24.612 --> 45:26.821
In the middle of the road.

45:27.196 --> 45:30.654
Wait. At... At like 12 o'clock?

45:31.112 --> 45:34.237
More like... More like 1 o'clock.

45:36.029 --> 45:38.054
I don't see it. I don't see the body.

45:38.154 --> 45:39.987
Exactly.

45:40.112 --> 45:43.071
Because you hit a fucking pothole.

45:49.821 --> 45:51.821
Shotgun.

46:04.904 --> 46:07.112
You all right?

46:09.696 --> 46:11.946
I'm sorry, guys.

46:13.737 --> 46:15.737
I really thought I hit someone.

46:19.071 --> 46:24.654
Yeah, well, I think I'm fat.
So, I guess we all have issues.

46:31.654 --> 46:34.612
Where the fuck is that coming from?

46:36.904 --> 46:39.054
- Hello?
- <i>You all pleased with yourselves?</i>

46:39.154 --> 46:41.262
- Mr. Rhodes.
- Fuck.

46:41.362 --> 46:44.279
- Hey, how's it goin'?
- <i>Fucking peachy.</i>

46:44.404 --> 46:47.904
I'm sorry to hear that.
What can I... what can I do you for, man?

46:48.029 --> 46:51.279
- <i>Let me talk to my son.</i>
- One second.

46:51.737 --> 46:54.887
I can't... I can't talk to him.

46:54.987 --> 46:58.321
- He doesn't want to fucking talk to you.
- <i>Put him on the phone!</i>

46:58.446 --> 47:01.721
I don't think he's going to change his mind
just because you're saying it louder.

47:01.821 --> 47:05.612
<i>I'm going to report the car stolen, and the
cops will track you and have you arrested.</i>

47:05.737 --> 47:08.112
He says he's gonna report
the car stolen.

47:08.696 --> 47:12.195
And the cops can track us.
We'll probably be arrested.

47:12.320 --> 47:14.612
I'm going to get deported.

47:14.737 --> 47:17.195
Nah. He won't do it.

47:17.404 --> 47:21.737
- How do you know?
- Because he won't risk the bad press.

47:22.279 --> 47:23.429
- Trust me.
- You sure?

47:23.529 --> 47:26.945
I'm... absolutely. Absolutely.

47:27.070 --> 47:29.154
Fuck. What's his first name?

47:29.279 --> 47:32.029
- Robert.
- Robert.

47:33.612 --> 47:36.654
Robbie? Hey, can I...
Do you mind if I call you Robbie?

47:36.779 --> 47:39.845
Great, thanks. So we really
appreciate the head's up,

47:39.945 --> 47:42.512
but I think we're just going
to take our chances.

47:42.612 --> 47:44.904
Yeah, if I see a cop,
I'll just fuckin' floor it.

47:45.029 --> 47:48.929
And I don't think there's ever been
a car chase that wasn't televised.

47:49.029 --> 47:52.429
Yeah, we'll probably get caught.
The perps always do, but you know what?

47:52.529 --> 47:54.695
I'm really looking forward
to being on the news.

47:54.820 --> 47:58.154
You know the camera does add ten pounds,
but I think it will be worth it, don't you?

48:00.195 --> 48:03.387
Hello? You still... you still there?

48:03.487 --> 48:06.095
And two... Oh! Two things.

48:06.195 --> 48:10.237
You're wrong. You don't know anything
about me. And you'll never see me again.

48:28.112 --> 48:29.945
What did she say?

48:30.279 --> 48:33.945
- She threatened me.
- What did he say?

48:34.445 --> 48:38.112
- That I'm wrong.
- Well, I could've told you that.

48:38.279 --> 48:39.654
Okay.

48:39.779 --> 48:44.570
We can't track them.
We need to put ourselves in their shoes.

48:45.154 --> 48:47.529
Where would we go?

48:48.237 --> 48:50.179
What do you mean?

48:50.279 --> 48:52.820
You just told off your father.
Where would you go?

48:52.945 --> 48:55.904
I'd never tell off my father.
I had too much respect for him.

48:58.070 --> 49:03.487
Okay. Then imagine your father
just told you that you were worthless,

49:03.779 --> 49:07.737
good for nothing, that you
couldn't even finish a sentence.

49:11.070 --> 49:12.612
Where would you go?

49:24.779 --> 49:26.529
I think I know where they're going.

49:31.695 --> 49:33.404
Careful!

49:33.529 --> 49:36.904
You're right. They probably
don't make parts for this car anymore.

49:38.445 --> 49:41.487
How in God's name do you know
how to do this, anyway?

49:41.612 --> 49:44.987
Let's just say
I wasn't always a politician.

49:45.820 --> 49:46.779
What?

49:46.904 --> 49:49.904
Maybe the apple didn't fall
far from the tree.

50:17.154 --> 50:21.529
<i>Dan, we're going to have
to cancel the next few days.</i>

50:21.737 --> 50:25.845
Cancel the next few days.
I don't care. Make something up.

50:25.945 --> 50:30.404
Whatever you want as long
as it doesn't cost me votes.

50:53.487 --> 50:58.095
I know, Monica. I know.

50:58.195 --> 51:00.445
I know!

51:28.778 --> 51:31.612
Alex, it was just a pothole, all right?
You don't have to stop.

51:35.070 --> 51:38.820
- What the fuck?
- Dead babies on the road.

51:42.153 --> 51:45.653
Fuck. We hit a pothole.

51:54.028 --> 51:55.487
Wake up!

52:01.153 --> 52:04.637
- Are you all right?
- No. You?

52:04.737 --> 52:06.737
No.

52:08.070 --> 52:11.987
Might I suggest that we stop
at a hotel for a few hours?

52:13.112 --> 52:15.612
Excellent idea.

52:20.820 --> 52:21.845
I'm starving.

52:21.945 --> 52:23.678
- We need gas.
- I need food.

52:23.778 --> 52:25.820
- What you need is a lobotomy.
- Shut up, Skeletor.

52:25.945 --> 52:29.570
Just... both of you shut up.
We need a plan.

52:30.070 --> 52:32.778
One of us pumps, one of us steals,
one of us distracts. I'll steal.

52:32.903 --> 52:34.345
I want to steal.

52:34.445 --> 52:38.112
So you can get stuck opening and closing
the door four times before you run out?

52:38.237 --> 52:41.653
- You're pumping.
- Absolutely not.

52:47.778 --> 52:50.737
- Get away from me.
- Going to get you.

52:52.403 --> 52:55.695
- You're pumping.
- Anal bleach.

52:56.237 --> 52:58.595
And I guess that means
you're distracting.

52:58.695 --> 53:02.278
Well, sounds like I was born
for this job.

53:03.362 --> 53:05.237
Okay.

53:35.070 --> 53:39.070
- That it?
- Yeah. Thank you.

53:40.278 --> 53:42.653
It's 5.95, then.

53:44.237 --> 53:47.278
- Can I help you?
- No, thanks.

53:53.070 --> 53:57.112
- Dude, 5.95.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

54:08.987 --> 54:11.028
Anything else?

54:13.570 --> 54:15.278
No.

54:16.236 --> 54:18.220
- What the fuck was that?
- I don't know.

54:18.320 --> 54:20.903
I can't remember
the last time that happened.

54:21.820 --> 54:23.945
- Where's my food?
- He didn't tic.

54:24.153 --> 54:27.945
You mean the only thing we got out
of that was a copy of Family Circle?

54:29.153 --> 54:32.195
This fucking sucks.

54:32.403 --> 54:37.261
Can't I get one suck ass advantage
out of this cock-sucking illness?

54:37.361 --> 54:39.095
They only come
when I don't want them to,

54:39.195 --> 54:42.695
and always at the worst
motherfucking moments.

54:43.986 --> 54:46.220
You just said like four sentences
without ticcing once.

54:46.320 --> 54:48.261
But he swore, like, ten times,
what's the difference?

54:48.361 --> 54:50.820
Shut the fu... up, Alex.

54:51.903 --> 54:54.320
There they are.
Welcome back to the freak show.

54:54.445 --> 54:58.070
Now? Cock fuck. Now?

54:58.570 --> 55:00.678
Okay, you know what?
Let's get out of here before they realize

55:00.778 --> 55:03.220
- we have no money for gas, okay?
- Absolutely not.

55:03.320 --> 55:05.720
I'm going in there
and I'm getting something to eat.

55:05.820 --> 55:08.778
You two stay here and be ready
to go when I run out.

55:18.445 --> 55:19.445
Really?

55:33.111 --> 55:35.011
Good evening, sir.

55:35.111 --> 55:37.070
Latex gloves are where?

55:41.528 --> 55:43.053
Fuck.

55:43.153 --> 55:45.403
Vincent, relax.

55:50.195 --> 55:52.845
There's a clown in my head,

55:52.945 --> 55:56.261
and he shits in between my thoughts.

55:56.361 --> 55:59.178
And he forces me to do
the most inappropriate... fuck!

55:59.278 --> 56:02.653
The most inappropriate thing
at the most inappropriate moment.

56:03.070 --> 56:08.111
So relaxing is pretty much
the one thing I cannot do.

56:17.028 --> 56:19.611
Why don't you eat?

56:21.195 --> 56:23.028
What?

56:24.111 --> 56:26.486
My brain is broken,

56:27.111 --> 56:30.111
but all you have to do is eat something.

56:34.611 --> 56:37.195
I...

56:42.361 --> 56:44.403
It's not that easy.

56:45.528 --> 56:47.903
Why not?

56:52.153 --> 56:54.845
- Go! Drive! Go! Go, now!
- How did you do that?

56:54.945 --> 56:57.261
- I said go!
- Holy shit.

56:57.361 --> 56:59.011
Fucking Christ.

56:59.111 --> 57:01.028
Come on.

57:10.861 --> 57:13.111
Hold it in until it makes you...

57:15.736 --> 57:17.111
Exactly.

57:17.236 --> 57:19.153
Why am I doing this again?

57:19.278 --> 57:22.070
Maybe it will help with the ticcing.

57:24.236 --> 57:28.153
So, what are you going to do
after we get to the ocean?

57:28.486 --> 57:30.528
I don't know.

57:31.528 --> 57:33.528
I haven't thought that far ahead yet.

57:37.986 --> 57:40.319
I want to get a dog.

57:40.444 --> 57:42.219
Hello, random. Someone's stoned.

57:42.319 --> 57:45.053
No, I'm serious, but I always
wanted a dog growing up,

57:45.153 --> 57:47.844
and my dad wouldn't let me.

57:47.944 --> 57:49.719
And then...

57:49.819 --> 57:51.986
And...

57:52.111 --> 57:54.761
after the divorce,

57:54.861 --> 57:57.553
taking care of my mom,

57:57.653 --> 58:00.403
it was a lot of work.

58:00.528 --> 58:02.553
Yeah.

58:02.653 --> 58:04.444
Well, now you're free.

58:05.486 --> 58:08.111
You don't have to take care of anyone.

58:23.653 --> 58:26.319
I don't know what's worse,
the fact that I just...

58:26.444 --> 58:30.986
defecated in the woods, or that my buttocks
now smell like Handiwipes.

58:32.819 --> 58:34.736
The mental image is worse.

58:36.028 --> 58:37.569
Are you guys smoking weed?

58:38.319 --> 58:40.069
No.

58:45.944 --> 58:48.403
You're repugnant.

58:51.653 --> 58:54.011
Come on, come back.

58:54.111 --> 58:56.053
Love you.

58:56.153 --> 58:58.861
I love pressing his buttons.

59:03.361 --> 59:05.903
What are you knitting, a noose?

59:06.569 --> 59:10.028
One more day in that clinic,
and, yeah, maybe.

59:10.528 --> 59:14.028
What ended up happening with Dr. Rose?

59:18.778 --> 59:21.153
Do you like to dance?

59:22.361 --> 59:23.403
Yeah.

59:23.778 --> 59:26.528
- Well, this is a waltz.
- I know.

59:27.111 --> 59:29.594
I know means you don't.

59:29.694 --> 59:31.903
You could show me.

59:32.403 --> 59:33.653
Okay.

59:34.153 --> 59:35.178
- Okay.
- Okay.

59:35.278 --> 59:36.428
- We're dancing?
- We're dancing.

59:36.528 --> 59:40.111
I want to take this hat off
so I look cooler.

59:42.569 --> 59:44.094
Yeah...

59:44.194 --> 59:46.594
- This hand, here.
- Okay.

59:46.694 --> 59:48.819
This hand, here.

59:48.944 --> 59:53.569
Look over the shoulder.
Posture, darling. Posture.

59:54.903 --> 59:57.469
Start with your right foot
and go forward.

59:57.569 --> 01:00:00.678
- Right. Foot forward.
- Foot, go forward.

01:00:00.778 --> 01:00:02.861
- All right, I'm ready.
- Ready? And...

01:00:10.111 --> 01:00:12.319
We're good. We're good, though.

01:00:15.903 --> 01:00:17.528
- Okay, spin me.
- Spin you?

01:00:20.278 --> 01:00:22.403
See, that was nice.

01:00:33.736 --> 01:00:35.319
Hey!

01:00:35.444 --> 01:00:37.444
I'm sorry.

01:00:37.569 --> 01:00:39.736
I'm sorry.

01:00:48.903 --> 01:00:52.403
Hey guys, this car
even has movie listings.

01:00:58.069 --> 01:01:00.236
Then kiss me right.

01:01:35.777 --> 01:01:37.052
I can't sleep.

01:01:37.152 --> 01:01:39.486
Probably because you got
enough sleep in the car.

01:01:44.736 --> 01:01:46.861
That girl...

01:01:47.236 --> 01:01:49.944
- Marie?
- Why doesn't she eat?

01:01:51.861 --> 01:01:54.444
Anorexia is a disease of the mind,

01:01:55.736 --> 01:01:59.611
so, even though we see skin and bones,

01:02:00.319 --> 01:02:02.527
all she sees is fat.

01:02:04.569 --> 01:02:06.652
But she won't drop dead
from that, right, I mean...

01:02:07.069 --> 01:02:09.694
you can live for weeks without food.

01:02:09.819 --> 01:02:13.569
Her heart already gave out once
a few months ago...

01:02:16.902 --> 01:02:22.194
which is why I threatened to force
feed her through a tube yesterday.

01:02:24.402 --> 01:02:26.944
And she jumped ship.

01:02:37.361 --> 01:02:40.111
It's not your fault.

01:02:41.444 --> 01:02:44.444
You were just doing your job.

01:03:03.194 --> 01:03:04.319
Morning.

01:03:11.402 --> 01:03:13.611
You're wearing my windbreaker.

01:03:17.652 --> 01:03:19.736
Behavioral exercise.

01:03:23.694 --> 01:03:25.736
Hey, do you think it's far to the top?

01:03:26.902 --> 01:03:29.552
Do I look like a tour guide?

01:03:29.652 --> 01:03:32.486
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's not and say we did.

01:03:35.569 --> 01:03:38.761
- I've never been on a mountain before.
- What if it sucks?

01:03:38.861 --> 01:03:41.219
- What if it's amazing?
- What if it's dangerous?

01:03:41.319 --> 01:03:43.444
What if it's... What if it's exciting?

01:03:43.694 --> 01:03:46.386
- What if we die?
- Well, what if we fucking live?

01:03:46.486 --> 01:03:50.344
- Stop yelling.
- He has Tourette's.

01:03:50.444 --> 01:03:52.611
We're going to the top.

01:03:54.736 --> 01:03:56.277
What?

01:03:58.444 --> 01:04:01.027
- Damn it.
- We're going to find them.

01:04:04.944 --> 01:04:07.386
Okay, you win.

01:04:07.486 --> 01:04:09.594
We'll go to the police.

01:04:09.694 --> 01:04:11.736
Thank you.

01:04:18.444 --> 01:04:20.486
Not far?

01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:22.736
It's probably not that far now.

01:04:26.777 --> 01:04:29.027
You okay?

01:04:29.402 --> 01:04:30.486
Fuck you.

01:04:36.361 --> 01:04:38.511
Be careful about Marie.

01:04:38.611 --> 01:04:40.777
Excuse me?

01:04:41.194 --> 01:04:44.152
Don't be fooled. She doesn't love you.

01:04:45.152 --> 01:04:49.319
Well, thanks... Fuck. For the advice.

01:04:49.735 --> 01:04:51.510
It's not you, it's her.
She's not capable.

01:04:51.610 --> 01:04:56.110
And you're the expert on relationships?
You can't even shake hands with someone.

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:07.485
It's just a plant.

01:05:12.569 --> 01:05:13.802
- Shit!
- Snake.

01:05:13.902 --> 01:05:15.860
Shit.

01:05:16.152 --> 01:05:18.219
- Get off the log. Let's get off the log!
- Hey, wait.

01:05:18.319 --> 01:05:20.610
Go. Go, go, go.

01:05:20.735 --> 01:05:24.110
I think it's, like, another...

01:05:24.944 --> 01:05:27.902
couple of hundred yards,
and we're there.

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:50.319
Echo!

01:05:55.235 --> 01:05:57.527
Look at that.

01:06:39.777 --> 01:06:43.735
I'm Alex in wonderland!

01:07:16.152 --> 01:07:18.360
I love these.

01:07:23.444 --> 01:07:27.735
- Hey, what the fuck are you doing?
- What is on my face? What is on my face?

01:07:28.027 --> 01:07:29.944
Vincent's mother.

01:07:35.652 --> 01:07:40.069
It serves you right... freak fuck.
You don't touch other people's stuff.

01:07:40.194 --> 01:07:42.152
Funny, that's how
this whole escapade started.

01:07:45.235 --> 01:07:47.152
Fuck.

01:08:32.234 --> 01:08:34.734
I didn't steal this food.

01:08:35.818 --> 01:08:39.051
Or the gas. I paid for it.

01:08:39.152 --> 01:08:40.943
With what money?

01:08:44.734 --> 01:08:46.402
Where did you get all that?

01:08:49.652 --> 01:08:51.818
It's mine.

01:08:52.234 --> 01:08:53.609
- From my disability allowance.
- Wait a minute,

01:08:53.734 --> 01:08:55.510
you've had that with you
the whole fucking time?

01:08:55.609 --> 01:08:57.176
You think I'd leave
my money lying around?

01:08:57.277 --> 01:08:59.635
- Why didn't you say something?
- Yeah, we could have used it.

01:08:59.734 --> 01:09:04.777
I may have issues, but I wasn't
about to fund my own kidnapping.

01:09:05.859 --> 01:09:08.010
Yeah, but... at the last gas station...

01:09:08.109 --> 01:09:09.968
Now, wait a minute,
the attendant chased you.

01:09:10.068 --> 01:09:14.234
I paid him to do that. I paid him!

01:09:15.027 --> 01:09:16.943
Why?

01:09:19.109 --> 01:09:22.152
Because I wanted you to think
I was cool.

01:09:22.443 --> 01:09:24.984
You don't know what it's like.

01:09:25.734 --> 01:09:30.568
I think I have a lot to offer, but these
stupid rituals just take over everything.

01:09:33.402 --> 01:09:35.359
This thing has...

01:09:35.652 --> 01:09:38.234
made my world smaller and smaller.

01:09:38.359 --> 01:09:40.777
I'm stuck in a fucking clinic.

01:09:44.734 --> 01:09:49.318
I'd give anything to be free from this,
but it doesn't stop, and it's not my fault.

01:10:00.235 --> 01:10:03.943
It was pretty cool
the way you ran out of there.

01:10:06.193 --> 01:10:07.818
Yeah, you did look pretty bad ass.

01:11:22.652 --> 01:11:24.860
I love you.

01:11:37.277 --> 01:11:39.193
Hey.

01:11:40.026 --> 01:11:41.860
Hey.

01:12:29.068 --> 01:12:30.818
We should...

01:12:31.235 --> 01:12:33.443
We should probably go.

01:12:33.776 --> 01:12:36.318
Alex is waiting.

01:12:38.443 --> 01:12:40.443
Yeah.

01:12:42.485 --> 01:12:44.735
Let's go.

01:13:31.235 --> 01:13:33.235
Fuck.

01:13:34.693 --> 01:13:38.151
- Marie?
- I'm coming.

01:13:38.568 --> 01:13:40.693
Alex is gone.

01:13:41.526 --> 01:13:45.385
- What?
- Alex is gone. The car is gone.

01:13:45.485 --> 01:13:47.318
Fuck!

01:14:04.568 --> 01:14:07.510
- <i>I got his account turned back on.</i>
- Thank you.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:10.610
Okay, so what do you want me
to tell Dan about tonight?

01:14:11.193 --> 01:14:16.360
- I don't know.
- <i>But, Robert, I just picked up my dress!</i>

01:14:16.735 --> 01:14:19.526
He's my son, Monica.

01:14:22.568 --> 01:14:25.860
- I'm going to go take a piss.
- All right.

01:14:31.776 --> 01:14:34.218
Where are you?

01:14:34.318 --> 01:14:36.443
Marie?

01:14:36.568 --> 01:14:37.968
Fuck.

01:14:38.068 --> 01:14:41.276
What, you get eaten by a bear
or something?

01:15:09.234 --> 01:15:11.984
We should probably keep going.

01:15:46.609 --> 01:15:48.693
Vincent?

01:15:57.193 --> 01:15:59.401
Car cunt.

01:16:00.318 --> 01:16:02.901
- Fuck.
- Where the fuck is he?

01:16:07.109 --> 01:16:09.651
Cunt licker. Fuck.

01:16:11.276 --> 01:16:13.568
What are you staring at?

01:16:13.984 --> 01:16:17.026
- What are you staring at? Fuck.
- Vincent, come on.

01:16:20.318 --> 01:16:21.443
- Anything?
- Nope.

01:16:21.568 --> 01:16:22.568
Shit.

01:16:22.693 --> 01:16:26.776
This is stupid. We should just camp out
by the car until he comes back.

01:16:28.068 --> 01:16:30.276
Wait a minute.

01:16:31.484 --> 01:16:34.651
- Do you hear that?
- What?

01:16:40.443 --> 01:16:42.484
Bach.

01:16:58.151 --> 01:17:00.109
Alex?

01:17:00.234 --> 01:17:02.343
I didn't say you could come in.

01:17:02.443 --> 01:17:05.443
Are you out of your mind? Crazy cunt.

01:17:05.568 --> 01:17:09.109
We've been searching everywhere for you.

01:17:10.193 --> 01:17:14.234
- I didn't ask you to.
- Well, you took the car, asshole.

01:17:14.818 --> 01:17:16.776
What was I supposed to do?

01:17:16.901 --> 01:17:19.551
Sit there and wait while you two
screwed yourselves silly?

01:17:19.651 --> 01:17:22.484
Please. Come on, Vincent. Let's go.

01:17:24.901 --> 01:17:27.901
He's not worth it. Come on, let's go.

01:17:35.734 --> 01:17:37.943
That's right, go on. Follow
the skinny bitch own the rabbit hole.

01:17:38.068 --> 01:17:40.009
Shut up, Alex!

01:17:40.109 --> 01:17:43.734
She's just using you.
You could be anyone. Anyone!

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:45.526
Do you really think she came
with you because she thinks

01:17:45.651 --> 01:17:47.843
you're just the most amazing
guy she ever met?

01:17:47.943 --> 01:17:50.384
Shut up. Shut your fucking face.

01:17:50.484 --> 01:17:53.401
Because when she sees you twitch,
she just can't help herself?

01:17:53.526 --> 01:17:56.651
She just wants an audience when she
finally starves herself to death.

01:17:57.526 --> 01:18:00.359
Come on, Vincent. Come on!

01:18:01.359 --> 01:18:03.401
But she needs someone to clean up
the mess after it's over,

01:18:03.526 --> 01:18:06.318
- and you're the perfect guy for the job.
- Stop it, Alex. Just stop!

01:18:06.734 --> 01:18:10.901
Running away from daddy to fulfill
mommy's dying wish. What a fucking hero.

01:18:11.026 --> 01:18:12.843
Though she probably imagined
her last trip to the coast

01:18:12.943 --> 01:18:15.568
in something other
than a ten-cent can of tin...

01:18:16.068 --> 01:18:18.234
Vincent!

01:18:18.693 --> 01:18:22.193
Vincent! Stop it!

01:18:22.901 --> 01:18:26.384
- You think you're better than us?
- Vincent, get off of him.

01:18:26.484 --> 01:18:28.568
You're nothing!

01:18:29.401 --> 01:18:31.151
Get off him, Vincent!

01:18:38.901 --> 01:18:41.984
Vincent, stop!

01:18:47.692 --> 01:18:50.942
I'll go get a towel. Alex, it's okay.
I'm going to get a towel.

01:18:57.067 --> 01:18:59.234
Just...

01:18:59.609 --> 01:19:03.276
Just calm down. It's just blood.
It's your blood.

01:19:03.401 --> 01:19:05.734
It's going to be okay.

01:19:07.942 --> 01:19:11.234
Just leave me alone.
You got the car, so just go.

01:19:11.734 --> 01:19:14.151
- Calm down.
- Just go.

01:19:17.901 --> 01:19:20.942
We're not going anywhere without you.

01:19:21.734 --> 01:19:25.276
You terrorist asshole.

01:19:50.484 --> 01:19:52.901
Holy fuck.

01:19:59.859 --> 01:20:02.901
- Oh, come on.
- What?

01:20:03.026 --> 01:20:04.734
You got a spare?

01:20:07.401 --> 01:20:10.234
God damn fucking piece of shit!

01:20:10.359 --> 01:20:13.026
The apple really didn't fall
far from the tree.

01:20:16.109 --> 01:20:18.567
Maybe you're right.

01:20:19.317 --> 01:20:20.984
You know, I was...

01:20:23.026 --> 01:20:26.651
I was the first one of my friends
to become a father.

01:20:27.859 --> 01:20:29.942
And Vincent was amazing.

01:20:30.067 --> 01:20:32.942
He was a little devil,
but he was amazing.

01:20:33.067 --> 01:20:37.067
- When did he start to show signs?
- In second or third grade.

01:20:37.234 --> 01:20:40.342
His teacher came to us and...

01:20:40.442 --> 01:20:42.984
said that he was...

01:20:43.901 --> 01:20:45.609
extremely outspoken.

01:20:46.067 --> 01:20:48.609
- Bet you liked that.
- Of course.

01:20:48.901 --> 01:20:52.776
And we just thought it was a phase
and that he'd grow out of it.

01:20:53.942 --> 01:20:56.442
But it just got worse?

01:20:57.817 --> 01:21:00.776
No, something died inside...

01:21:01.526 --> 01:21:04.776
of me when we got the diagnosis.

01:21:06.901 --> 01:21:11.317
All my hopes and dreams
for him just disappeared.

01:21:14.234 --> 01:21:17.901
And every time
I looked at him and he was...

01:21:19.026 --> 01:21:21.426
twitching and...

01:21:21.526 --> 01:21:24.567
cursing and what not...

01:21:28.026 --> 01:21:31.401
It felt like I was looking
at someone else's kid.

01:21:31.734 --> 01:21:34.442
Someone else's problem.

01:21:39.317 --> 01:21:43.942
And I felt awful, not only for him,
but for his parents.

01:21:46.526 --> 01:21:48.567
And then...

01:21:48.901 --> 01:21:53.067
he called me dad. Dad!

01:21:54.067 --> 01:21:55.692
Fuck, dad!

01:21:59.734 --> 01:22:02.651
It's awful to say, but...

01:22:04.484 --> 01:22:06.734
I was embarrassed by him.

01:22:07.442 --> 01:22:11.442
And the pitiful looks
we'd get from people.

01:22:11.734 --> 01:22:14.900
Have to leave restaurants and movies.

01:22:15.025 --> 01:22:17.650
We got kicked off a plane once.

01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:23.775
And I just wanted...

01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:28.567
a different boy...

01:22:30.734 --> 01:22:33.109
and he knew it.

01:22:34.817 --> 01:22:37.609
He could see it on my face.

01:22:39.692 --> 01:22:43.234
I don't think he'll ever be able
to forgive me for that.

01:22:53.234 --> 01:22:57.484
Seems like he's capable
of a whole lot more than you think.

01:24:34.525 --> 01:24:36.425
Anything?

01:24:36.525 --> 01:24:38.400
No.

01:24:39.192 --> 01:24:41.359
Nothing at the clinic either.

01:24:41.650 --> 01:24:43.967
You know, he's right.

01:24:44.067 --> 01:24:47.984
- I don't know anything about him.
- Why'd you think he'd come here?

01:24:51.025 --> 01:24:53.775
He took this right over there.

01:24:56.692 --> 01:24:58.884
It's a beautiful photo of her.

01:24:58.984 --> 01:25:01.484
See how happy she was?

01:25:01.775 --> 01:25:03.900
I think you can see something else.

01:25:04.192 --> 01:25:06.234
What?

01:25:06.359 --> 01:25:09.859
Just how happy the photographer was too.

01:25:44.483 --> 01:25:46.342
Alex... Alex, relax.

01:25:46.442 --> 01:25:50.067
It's just a pothole, please. No, please.

01:26:09.608 --> 01:26:11.983
Race you to the water?

01:26:28.192 --> 01:26:30.358
Hey, wait.

01:26:31.858 --> 01:26:33.108
Vincent...

01:26:33.233 --> 01:26:35.858
Come on! Marie?

01:26:37.567 --> 01:26:39.400
Marie?

01:26:39.733 --> 01:26:41.775
Marie!

01:26:44.608 --> 01:26:46.300
Oh, my God.

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:48.733
Marie! Marie?

01:26:50.233 --> 01:26:54.508
Ge... Get... Get help! Get an ambulance!

01:26:54.608 --> 01:26:56.692
Marie?

01:26:57.233 --> 01:26:59.317
Quick!

01:27:01.942 --> 01:27:02.942
Marie?

01:27:10.650 --> 01:27:12.983
Can you hear me?
Marie, can you hear my voice?

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:15.275
Marie?

01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:19.008
Marie. Marie, I'm here.

01:27:19.108 --> 01:27:20.967
- Marie...
- Back.

01:27:21.067 --> 01:27:23.900
Look, we're taking her to Santa Cruz
Hospital. You can meet us there.

01:27:27.442 --> 01:27:29.983
Take care of her.

01:28:54.608 --> 01:28:56.567
Hi.

01:28:56.692 --> 01:28:58.358
Hey.

01:29:03.025 --> 01:29:05.108
How are you?

01:29:08.650 --> 01:29:12.508
Marie... Marie, it's okay. Just relax.

01:29:12.608 --> 01:29:14.300
Listen... Listen, just... just relax.

01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:17.608
- Just relax. Please?
- Take it out. Take it out, please.

01:29:17.733 --> 01:29:19.216
- I can't.
- Please!

01:29:19.316 --> 01:29:21.400
You know, your parents are coming.

01:29:25.525 --> 01:29:27.525
No.

01:29:28.525 --> 01:29:29.941
Get me out of here.

01:29:30.566 --> 01:29:34.175
Get you out of here?
Marie, you were dead.

01:29:34.275 --> 01:29:35.466
They brought you back.

01:29:35.566 --> 01:29:38.883
Please, just undo the straps, okay?
Just undo the straps for me!

01:29:38.983 --> 01:29:42.525
Marie, please, just listen to me
for a second. Just listen to me.

01:29:43.025 --> 01:29:45.675
- Listen to me.
- We can keep on going.

01:29:45.775 --> 01:29:48.675
Without Alex. Just me and you.

01:29:48.775 --> 01:29:50.608
We can keep on going.

01:29:50.816 --> 01:29:56.191
- Anywhere you wanna go.
- I... I can't take care of you.

01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:59.025
- I'm okay. I'm okay.
- I can't...

01:29:59.150 --> 01:30:03.316
I can't make you better. I'm sorry.

01:30:05.691 --> 01:30:07.900
Vincent...

01:30:08.816 --> 01:30:10.316
Vincent...

01:30:14.066 --> 01:30:18.441
Just find me. Find me, okay?

01:30:23.025 --> 01:30:25.550
Where are you going?

01:30:25.650 --> 01:30:27.775
I'll be waiting.

01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:30.108
Where are you going?

01:30:31.025 --> 01:30:34.566
Please... Please come back.

01:30:37.566 --> 01:30:40.650
Vincent, you love me!

01:30:40.983 --> 01:30:44.150
Please! Please!

01:30:44.441 --> 01:30:47.316
Vincent, come back!

01:31:30.441 --> 01:31:31.900
You all right?

01:31:32.525 --> 01:31:36.300
- What do you care?
- Vincent, stop.

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:40.066
- Vincent. Vincent!
- What do you want?

01:31:40.191 --> 01:31:43.566
What the fuck do you want from me?

01:31:48.025 --> 01:31:50.425
- Nothing. Can we please just...
- Good! Good!

01:31:50.525 --> 01:31:53.150
'Cause I don't want anything
from you either!

01:31:53.733 --> 01:31:55.091
Vincent, stop.

01:31:55.191 --> 01:31:58.383
I'm trying to have a conversation with you,
but you're making it impossible.

01:31:58.483 --> 01:32:00.566
I'm making a conversation impossible?

01:32:00.691 --> 01:32:02.983
Maybe it's because I have
fucking Tourette's.

01:32:03.525 --> 01:32:04.816
Vincent, don't.

01:32:05.608 --> 01:32:08.883
Vincent, stop! Don't be this person.

01:32:08.983 --> 01:32:11.800
Oh, what... what...
what person am I being?

01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:13.775
Me!

01:32:17.191 --> 01:32:21.608
You got my temper, that's for sure,
but the rest of this... this isn't you.

01:32:23.566 --> 01:32:25.191
You're more like your mom.

01:32:25.691 --> 01:32:27.300
And thank God for that,

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:32.150
because I will have completely failed you
as a father if you end up anything like me.

01:32:34.066 --> 01:32:37.733
And I can't live with that.
I just can't.

01:32:42.816 --> 01:32:47.441
She wasn't... perfect either.

01:32:49.108 --> 01:32:51.341
No, she wasn't.

01:32:51.441 --> 01:32:54.024
But I wish I had half
the strength that she did.

01:32:58.149 --> 01:33:00.899
She was one tough lady.

01:33:03.024 --> 01:33:06.024
Obviously not tough enough.

01:34:15.941 --> 01:34:18.024
Wait.

01:34:18.899 --> 01:34:23.108
If it's okay, I wanna
hang around here for a bit.

01:34:24.774 --> 01:34:28.608
Maybe see if I can get to 7-Eleven.

01:34:33.649 --> 01:34:35.024
You look awful.

01:34:36.733 --> 01:34:38.899
I'm fine.

01:34:39.566 --> 01:34:41.441
Really?

01:34:44.816 --> 01:34:47.524
Never better.

01:34:52.066 --> 01:34:53.899
So...

01:34:54.733 --> 01:34:56.233
I'll see you soon.

01:34:56.649 --> 01:34:59.191
Hopefully before Christmas.

01:35:02.566 --> 01:35:05.233
Vincent, wait.

01:35:05.774 --> 01:35:07.358
Can I have her?

01:35:10.649 --> 01:35:12.233
I know where she wants to go.

01:35:42.399 --> 01:35:44.649
Thanks for the suit.

01:35:53.733 --> 01:35:57.066
Wait! Wait!

01:35:57.733 --> 01:36:00.174
What are you doing here?

01:36:00.274 --> 01:36:02.483
Behavioral exercise.

01:36:20.941 --> 01:36:23.632
So, when are we gonna visit Marie?

01:36:23.732 --> 01:36:27.049
First thing tomorrow.
We need to find a hotel.

01:36:27.149 --> 01:36:29.816
Fine. But I'm starving.
Let's go to Subway.

01:36:29.941 --> 01:36:33.399
- Eat fresh latex, cunt.
- You really love that word, don't you?

01:36:33.524 --> 01:36:35.799
Have you ever counted how many times
you say that word a day?

01:36:35.899 --> 01:36:38.591
62,175...

01:36:38.691 --> 01:36:41.191
Four million and a half.

01:36:41.649 --> 01:36:43.732
<i>No</i>

01:36:44.316 --> 01:36:46.591
<i>And I don't wanna let it go</i>

01:36:46.691 --> 01:36:50.566
<i>I'm a little bit angry
when everyone's around</i>

01:36:50.691 --> 01:36:54.466
<i>But I get a little lonely
when no one's out</i>

01:36:54.566 --> 01:36:57.899
<i>I feel my demons</i>

01:36:58.024 --> 01:37:02.316
<i>Misleading me</i>

01:37:02.482 --> 01:37:06.341
<i>I'm just a believer
that things will get better</i>

01:37:06.441 --> 01:37:10.424
<i>Some can take it or leave it
But I don't wanna let it go</i>

01:37:10.524 --> 01:37:14.566
<i>I'm just a believer
that things will get better</i>

01:37:22.566 --> 01:37:25.232
<i>Oh, only dreaming about tomorrows</i>

01:37:25.357 --> 01:37:28.857
<i>Got us feeling so alive</i>

01:37:28.982 --> 01:37:33.632
<i>And we're livin' it up
Only thinking about tomorrow</i>

01:37:33.732 --> 01:37:38.007
<i>With the rain falling light</i>

01:37:38.107 --> 01:37:43.232
<i>And the mountains are on our eyes</i>

01:37:50.274 --> 01:37:52.799
<i>Oh, only dreaming about tomorrow</i>

01:37:52.899 --> 01:37:56.424
<i>And the possibilities of life</i>

01:37:56.524 --> 01:38:01.174
<i>Is not a way to host
Or let go of the sorrow</i>

01:38:01.274 --> 01:38:05.466
<i>Just the sun setting right</i>

01:38:05.566 --> 01:38:09.424
<i>And the ocean before our eyes</i>

01:38:09.524 --> 01:38:11.607
<i>Singing</i>

01:38:21.066 --> 01:38:23.982
<i>Sha-la-la-la</i>

01:38:37.899 --> 01:38:40.674
<i>Oh, only dreaming about tomorrows</i>

01:38:40.774 --> 01:38:43.924
<i>Got us smiling eye to eye</i>

01:38:44.024 --> 01:38:46.066
<i>And there's not a</i>

01:38:46.191 --> 01:38:49.007
<i>Worry to hold or a fear left to borrow</i>

01:38:49.107 --> 01:38:53.191
<i>Just the rain falling light</i>

01:38:53.316 --> 01:38:57.066
<i>And the mountains are on our eyes</i>

01:38:57.191 --> 01:38:59.191
