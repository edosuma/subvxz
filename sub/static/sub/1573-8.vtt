<b>6x08 - "The Disappeared", part 1</b>

00:22.582 --> 00:24.501
<i>Mystery on Bardotta!</i>

00:24.543 --> 00:27.087
<i>An oasis of peace during the Clone Wars.</i>

00:27.129 --> 00:29.923
<i>The galaxy-wide conflict now
threatens the ancient ways</i>

00:29.965 --> 00:31.675
<i>of the Bardottan people.</i>

00:31.717 --> 00:34.594
<i>With their spiritual leaders
mysteriously vanishing,</i>

00:34.636 --> 00:38.057
<i>the foundations of order in
its system are near collapse.</i>

00:38.098 --> 00:40.351
<i>In desperation, the Queen of Bardotta</i>

00:40.391 --> 00:43.937
<i>has called upon the Republic Senate
with a puzzling request:</i>

00:43.979 --> 00:47.316
<i>to help save her people
from certain doom.</i>

00:47.358 --> 00:49.193
I have humbly come before you

00:49.235 --> 00:52.863
to ask for assistance
in our time of need, Chancellor.

00:52.905 --> 00:56.116
Queen Julia,
the Republic is honored

00:56.158 --> 00:58.827
that you have come to us
for aid.

00:58.869 --> 01:01.080
We are always happy to support

01:01.121 --> 01:04.833
the neutral systems
in a time of crisis.

01:04.875 --> 01:08.670
If I may introduce
two of our best Ambassadors...

01:08.712 --> 01:10.672
With all due respect, Chancellor,

01:10.714 --> 01:14.843
there is only one person in
the Republic I will meet with.

01:20.349 --> 01:22.475
Representative Binks?

01:22.517 --> 01:23.852
Why would the Queen of Bardotta

01:23.894 --> 01:25.812
request the presence of Jar Jar Binks?

01:25.854 --> 01:27.647
I'm afraid she would not say,

01:27.689 --> 01:29.482
but she impressed upon the Senate

01:29.524 --> 01:31.902
the urgency of their situation.

01:31.944 --> 01:35.281
And what exactly
is the trouble on Bardotta?

01:35.322 --> 01:37.657
Several
of the ancient mystics,

01:37.699 --> 01:41.161
the Dagoyan Masters,
have disappeared.

01:41.203 --> 01:44.915
A strong connection to the Force
the Dagoyan Masters have.

01:44.957 --> 01:47.960
Yet unlike the Jedi or Sith they are.

01:48.001 --> 01:50.796
Warriors they are not.

01:50.837 --> 01:53.090
Intuition, knowledge,

01:53.132 --> 01:56.427
the harmony of the universe
is what they sense.

01:56.468 --> 01:58.762
Passively they connect with the Force.

01:58.804 --> 02:01.890
I wonder why the Queen
doesn't want a Jedi

02:01.932 --> 02:04.601
sent to solve this mystery.

02:04.643 --> 02:08.854
Long ago, inducted into the Jedi
Order Bardottan children were.

02:08.896 --> 02:12.985
However thieves the Jedi
were named by the Dagoyan.

02:13.026 --> 02:14.527
The Dagoyan Masters believed

02:14.569 --> 02:16.696
the Jedi took the children
against their will.

02:16.738 --> 02:19.116
We were labeled as kidnappers.

02:19.158 --> 02:20.575
Chancellor, am I to understand

02:20.617 --> 02:22.369
the Queen requested
Representatives Binks

02:22.411 --> 02:24.579
go alone to Bardotta?

02:24.621 --> 02:27.582
I'm afraid she was
quite specific on that point.

02:27.624 --> 02:30.669
I think that course of action is unwise.

02:30.710 --> 02:32.421
If there is trouble on Bardotta,

02:32.463 --> 02:34.881
I'm afraid
Representative Binks will be...

02:34.923 --> 02:36.633
out of his depth.

02:36.675 --> 02:39.928
I agree, which is why I came to you.

02:39.970 --> 02:43.307
We await your decision.

02:43.349 --> 02:44.850
Are you volunteering

02:44.891 --> 02:47.144
to undertake this mission,
Master Windu?

02:47.186 --> 02:50.605
If the Council agrees, yes.

03:00.115 --> 03:03.076
Do not touch anything.

03:03.118 --> 03:05.912
Oh, mesa not doing nothing.
Hmm.

03:05.954 --> 03:07.247
Representative Binks,

03:07.289 --> 03:09.249
I do not mean to be presumptuous,

03:09.291 --> 03:12.252
but are you sure you are the delegate

03:12.294 --> 03:13.753
the Queen spoke of?

03:13.795 --> 03:16.423
Yup.
The Queen is mesa pallo.

03:16.465 --> 03:19.759
Mesa knowin' her for a longo time.

03:43.658 --> 03:47.079
The Queen did not request
your presence, Jedi.

03:50.790 --> 03:52.667
Your lightsaber, please.

03:55.379 --> 03:58.006
Mesa Representative Binks
of the Republic Senate,

03:58.048 --> 04:00.675
and hesa with mesa.

04:00.717 --> 04:05.638
Representative Binks, you are
an honored guest of the Queen.

04:05.680 --> 04:07.099
Come.

04:23.323 --> 04:24.741
Oh!

04:34.334 --> 04:36.836
Representative Binks
of the Republic,

04:36.878 --> 04:39.465
you were requested
to come here alone.

04:39.506 --> 04:43.385
Why have you brought this Jedi
to Bardotta?

04:43.427 --> 04:47.514
Oh, Great Queenie Julia,
please forgive mesa.

04:47.556 --> 04:49.433
Disa Jedi is mesa pallo.

04:49.475 --> 04:52.644
Hesa coming here to be helping
mesa solve your troubles.

04:52.685 --> 04:54.854
He is your servant, then?

04:54.896 --> 04:55.855
Umm...

04:55.897 --> 04:59.318
Yes!
Yes, dat is the truth.

04:59.359 --> 05:03.196
Masteren Mace
is mesa humble servant.

05:03.238 --> 05:04.615
Very well.

05:04.656 --> 05:08.118
Jedi, because Jar Jar Binks
vouches for you,

05:08.160 --> 05:11.371
I will allow you
to stay here.

05:11.413 --> 05:14.625
For now, you must wait
in the antechamber.

05:22.090 --> 05:24.050
Jar Jar, we are in danger.

05:24.092 --> 05:26.553
An ancient prophecy
is coming true.

05:26.595 --> 05:30.807
Our beloved Dagoyan Masters
are disappearing one by one,

05:30.849 --> 05:32.892
and if they are not returned,

05:32.934 --> 05:36.271
a darkness will arise
that will engulf the galaxy.

05:36.313 --> 05:40.108
Mesa not letting that happen,
milady.

05:40.150 --> 05:41.901
High Seneschal Peteen,

05:41.943 --> 05:45.447
I must speak
to Representative Binks alone.

06:02.631 --> 06:06.677
It's been a long time,
my love.

06:06.717 --> 06:08.928
Come.

06:08.970 --> 06:13.433
Meditate with me,
so our minds may be as one.

06:21.816 --> 06:24.570
There is a great disturbance
in the Force here.

06:24.611 --> 06:26.737
That much is certain.

06:26.779 --> 06:28.615
I can sense it all around me.

06:28.657 --> 06:31.284
Hmm, difficult to see.

06:31.326 --> 06:34.580
Such disdain for the Jedi
there is on Bardotta.

06:34.621 --> 06:37.583
A good place for evil
to hide it may be.

06:37.624 --> 06:39.000
Yet remember,

06:39.042 --> 06:41.294
drifting within the flow
of the living Force,

06:41.336 --> 06:44.590
the minds
of the Dagoyan Masters are.

06:44.631 --> 06:46.466
Essential this connection is,

06:46.508 --> 06:49.553
whether friend to the Jedi
they be or not.

06:49.595 --> 06:51.263
Hmm.

06:51.304 --> 06:52.723
If you are looking for
a friend of the Bardottan's,

06:52.763 --> 06:54.433
look no further
than Representative Binks.

06:54.474 --> 06:58.061
The Queen has been alone with
him for quite some time now.

06:58.103 --> 07:02.065
The innocence of a child
this Gungan has.

07:02.107 --> 07:05.569
Perhaps appealing
to the Dagoyan his mind is.

07:05.611 --> 07:07.738
Well, my mind
would be more at ease

07:07.778 --> 07:09.864
if I knew
what they've been up to.

07:12.158 --> 07:14.077
I'm here to see
Representative Binks.

07:14.119 --> 07:16.538
The Queen said
no interruptions.

07:24.087 --> 07:27.758
Jar Jar, I asked you here
because I trust you,

07:27.799 --> 07:29.884
because I know you
will be able to help me

07:29.926 --> 07:31.844
in ways others cannot.

07:31.886 --> 07:34.973
Mesa hoping so, milady.

07:38.143 --> 07:40.437
You will let me inside.

07:40.479 --> 07:43.106
You should know better,
Master Jedi.

07:43.148 --> 07:45.400
That will not work
on a Dagoyan.

07:47.486 --> 07:48.487
Hmm.

07:59.831 --> 08:02.584
I have discovered
a terrible secret,

08:02.626 --> 08:05.629
buried within the rippling waves
of the Force.

08:05.671 --> 08:10.550
Uh, maybe itsa best to get
Masteren Mace to hear this.

08:10.592 --> 08:12.469
No, Jar Jar, only you.

08:12.511 --> 08:13.762
I must tell you.

08:13.804 --> 08:16.515
I cannot trust the Jedi
with this secret.

08:27.359 --> 08:29.986
When the Dagoyan Masters
started disappearing,

08:30.028 --> 08:33.365
I meditated to try
and discover their whereabouts,

08:33.405 --> 08:35.283
but what I saw was shocking.

08:35.325 --> 08:38.035
I stumbled upon
a terrible plot.

08:39.371 --> 08:41.289
Excuse the intrusion,
your majesty.

08:42.332 --> 08:44.417
I will not excuse you!

08:44.459 --> 08:46.961
Where are the guards
who told you to enter?

08:47.003 --> 08:49.631
The guards had other business
to attend to.

08:51.049 --> 08:52.676
We apologize, your majesty.

08:52.718 --> 08:54.803
The Jedi slipped past us.

08:54.845 --> 08:58.849
You see, Jar Jar, these Jedi
are deceptive, as I said.

08:58.890 --> 09:02.602
Julia Queenie, uh,
but yousa let mesa handle dis.

09:02.644 --> 09:05.605
I promise
da Jedi Masteren Mace

09:05.647 --> 09:08.024
will besa no trouble
for you.

09:08.066 --> 09:09.651
Very well, Jar Jar.

09:09.693 --> 09:11.027
Take him out of my sight.

09:11.069 --> 09:14.072
I will wait right here
for you.

09:24.750 --> 09:27.001
Careful!

09:27.043 --> 09:28.795
What do you think
you're doing?

09:28.837 --> 09:30.547
Where were you last night?

09:30.589 --> 09:33.132
Doing?
Mesa love da Queen Julia.

09:33.174 --> 09:34.634
Wadsa wrong witdat?

09:34.676 --> 09:36.887
You are jeopardizing
the mission.

09:36.928 --> 09:38.889
No, no, Masteren Jedi.

09:38.930 --> 09:40.682
Mesa love
for beautiful Julia

09:40.724 --> 09:42.601
is da only thing
startin' the talks.

09:42.642 --> 09:44.936
Shesa trustin' only mesa...

09:44.977 --> 09:46.979
oh, and now yousa...

09:47.021 --> 09:49.148
a little.

09:49.190 --> 09:50.734
You must understand,
Jar Jar,

09:50.776 --> 09:53.069
the Force is strangely
out of balance here.

09:53.111 --> 09:55.071
Did the Queen tell you
anything important?

09:55.113 --> 09:56.364
Dats what she
was trying to do

09:56.406 --> 09:58.658
before yousa come in all hot-like.

09:59.951 --> 10:01.286
Take this.

10:01.327 --> 10:03.079
Since they seem to want
to keep us separated,

10:03.121 --> 10:05.164
contact me if you learn
anything useful.

10:05.206 --> 10:06.958
Okey-day, Masteren Mace,

10:06.999 --> 10:10.378
but only if Queenie thinks
it's all right to tell you.

10:19.345 --> 10:21.640
Masteren Mace, come quickly!

10:24.016 --> 10:25.393
Shesa gone!

10:26.937 --> 10:28.271
Queenie is gone!

10:28.313 --> 10:30.482
Calm yourself, Binks.

10:30.523 --> 10:32.984
Dissin bad,
very very bad.

10:33.025 --> 10:34.986
She has disappeared,

10:35.027 --> 10:37.572
like the other
Dagoyan Masters before her.

10:37.614 --> 10:39.324
But it's not possible.

10:39.365 --> 10:42.201
No one could have left this room
without our knowing it.

10:42.243 --> 10:44.329
I will convene
the Bahk-tov Council.

10:44.370 --> 10:45.371
Come!

11:03.473 --> 11:05.976
<i>Guards!
Bahk-tov toi!</i>

11:11.857 --> 11:13.984
There can be no doubt.

11:14.024 --> 11:16.778
The prophecy is being fulfilled,
as it was written.

11:16.820 --> 11:19.698
First, the Dagoyan Masters
disappeared,

11:19.739 --> 11:21.533
and now the Queen.

11:21.574 --> 11:24.160
If she does not return
in three rotations,

11:24.202 --> 11:26.538
I'm afraid she will
be gone forever

11:26.579 --> 11:30.667
and an era of Darkness
will rise throughout the galaxy.

11:30.709 --> 11:32.711
Distinguished Council,
if I may...

11:32.752 --> 11:35.630
The coming of the Jedi
was a sign!

11:35.672 --> 11:37.298
It was a sign!

11:37.340 --> 11:39.091
Harbinger of doom!

11:39.133 --> 11:40.426
The harbinger of doom!

11:40.468 --> 11:41.678
Council!

11:41.720 --> 11:44.597
Oh, great Bardotta Council.

11:44.639 --> 11:47.851
Please, yousa
must listen to mesa.

11:47.893 --> 11:52.104
Queenie Julia was me bombad
pallo for many years.

11:52.146 --> 11:54.649
Shesa knew there
be troubles here.

11:54.691 --> 11:56.484
Dats why she callin' mesa,

11:56.526 --> 11:59.821
to helpin' in your time
of need.

11:59.863 --> 12:04.158
Mesa takin' my loyal helper,
Masteren Mace,

12:04.200 --> 12:06.036
and we findin' da Queenie

12:06.076 --> 12:08.872
and bringin' her
backin to yousa.

12:12.918 --> 12:15.670
Ask them about the origin
of the prophecy.

12:15.712 --> 12:21.634
Now, let mesa askin' yousa
where dis prophecy comin' from.

12:21.676 --> 12:24.262
They are the words
of the Frangawl clan,

12:24.303 --> 12:26.096
who worshipped to Malmourral,

12:26.138 --> 12:29.099
the ancient demon
of our faith.

12:29.141 --> 12:33.646
Their ancient shrine is located
under our present-day Temple,

12:33.688 --> 12:35.523
far beneath the surface.

12:35.565 --> 12:38.985
It is a cursed place,
an evil place.

12:39.027 --> 12:43.949
No one who enters those caverns
ever returns.

12:43.990 --> 12:46.993
Then that is where
we must look first.

12:47.035 --> 12:50.246
Den dats where we be
goin' first!

12:59.589 --> 13:01.173
Oh, boi!

13:01.215 --> 13:03.217
Dis gonna be bombad trouble.

13:03.259 --> 13:04.970
Mesa knowin' it.

13:13.227 --> 13:17.273
Um, uh, are yousa sure
dissa the right way?

13:17.315 --> 13:22.112
Yes, but ahead there
is only darkness and evil.

13:22.152 --> 13:25.991
Then, yes, Jar Jar,
this is the correct path.

13:26.032 --> 13:29.619
Okay.
Hmm...

13:31.788 --> 13:33.957
Here's your weapon,
Master Jedi.

13:33.999 --> 13:36.709
Let us hope you do not
have to use it.

13:41.006 --> 13:43.758
The Frangawl ruled Bardotta
with an iron hand

13:43.800 --> 13:45.301
for most of its early history.

13:45.343 --> 13:47.428
They were warriors.

13:47.470 --> 13:49.221
Some would call them barbarians,

13:49.263 --> 13:53.225
but in fact they were men
and women of spirit.

13:57.897 --> 14:01.484
Mesa no liken this place.
No way.

14:14.080 --> 14:17.542
Look... a piece of
the Queenie Julia's headdress!

14:22.254 --> 14:24.507
Oh, no.
Mesa disappearin'.

14:24.549 --> 14:26.051
Mesa disappearin'!

14:26.092 --> 14:28.970
Masteren Mace! Help!
Masteren Mace!

14:30.680 --> 14:32.098
Masteren Mace!

14:41.191 --> 14:42.400
Jar Jar!

14:47.030 --> 14:48.907
He's been taken,

15:38.915 --> 15:40.959

and brought here.

15:43.086 --> 15:44.754
You'll never free yourself.

15:44.796 --> 15:48.382
We are doomed to be sacrificed
to Malmourral.

15:53.345 --> 15:55.140
This is bombad trouble.

15:56.432 --> 15:58.101

17:09.297 --> 17:12.550

17:12.590 --> 17:15.761
They are stealing the Force
within us.

17:15.803 --> 17:17.471
<i>Humbah!</i>

<i>Looganah!</i>

17:22.560 --> 17:25.063
<i>Disjenck!</i>

17:25.104 --> 17:29.775
Now shall the demon of war,
Malmourral, be sated.

17:34.280 --> 17:38.201
Now shall the Frangawl clan
steal your essence.

17:46.167 --> 17:47.168

18:23.037 --> 18:24.496
Yousa got the wrong Gungan.

18:24.538 --> 18:27.458
The Force resides
within all living things.

18:27.499 --> 18:31.503
What little you have
will be ours.

18:31.545 --> 18:32.922
Jar Jar!

18:32.964 --> 18:35.174
Hmm?

18:41.847 --> 18:43.182

18:47.686 --> 18:48.687
Yah!

18:51.065 --> 18:52.275

18:52.317 --> 18:55.320
Mesa bombad warrior.

Go!

20:07.641 --> 20:09.143
Oh!

20:47.639 --> 20:50.476
The demonic cult of Malmourral
is active once again.

20:50.518 --> 20:52.353
If they steal
the essence of the Queen,

20:52.395 --> 20:55.814
darkness will fall across the stars.

20:55.856 --> 20:57.942
Mesa no bombad warrior,

20:57.983 --> 21:01.112

21:01.153 --> 21:05.324
