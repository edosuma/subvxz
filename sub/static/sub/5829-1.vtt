01:32.509 --> 01:36.513
Once upon a time in New York,
there was a cop named Charlie.

01:36.680 --> 01:42.436
He was a very decent guy,
as was his partner, Bo.

01:42.644 --> 01:45.189
He was a good listener.

01:47.900 --> 01:51.069
He loved kids.

02:03.040 --> 02:07.336
He had patience
and common sense.

02:19.681 --> 02:23.936
He was resourceful.

02:27.314 --> 02:34.363
Okay people, let's go.
Step lively now, come on.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.584
He was just a good cop.

02:51.421 --> 02:56.760
Charlie lived happily in Queens,
where he was born and grew up.

02:56.927 --> 03:00.097
- Yo, Charlie!
- Jesu!

03:00.305 --> 03:04.309
- Kill anybody today?
- Didn't even wound anybody.

03:04.476 --> 03:09.106
- You won't see your wife?
- I mustn't surprise her at work.

03:09.273 --> 03:14.236
Charlie was married to Muriel.
She hated Queens.

03:14.403 --> 03:19.199
If he was a detective,
he'd have decent clothes.

03:19.366 --> 03:25.873
- But he's got to wear the uniform.
- I feel for you. You have ambition.

03:26.039 --> 03:29.710
I never pushed him enough.

03:29.918 --> 03:33.755
If he was on the take,
I'd say, "He has initiative!"

03:33.964 --> 03:37.968
My sister was married to a cop.
It's a no-win situation.

03:38.135 --> 03:42.055
Either they're honest and broke,
or crooks that never come home.

03:42.264 --> 03:44.558
What did she do?

03:44.725 --> 03:49.688
She left him and married an
electrician. That's real money.

03:49.855 --> 03:55.485
I'm running out of patience.
I'm a person who needs money.

03:56.195 --> 04:01.491
And then there's Yvonne, a waitress,
who gets some terrible news.

04:01.658 --> 04:07.998
Miss Biasi, it says here that you
owe $12,000 on your MasterCard.

04:08.165 --> 04:13.587
Those charges were incurred by my
ex-husband, after I threw him out.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.380
The bank is not aware
of your divorce.

04:16.548 --> 04:21.678
We're not divorced yet, but I told
him to tear up the credit cards.

04:21.887 --> 04:26.850
If you're not divorced yet, you're
liable for your husband's debts.

04:27.017 --> 04:30.687
I'm divorced in my heart.
That's what counts.

04:30.854 --> 04:34.191
Legally, that's not what counts.

04:34.983 --> 04:39.696
Do you know how much it costs?
Have you ever been divorced?

04:41.949 --> 04:46.912
Probably not. Probably you've
had good luck your entire life.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.791
Which is the opposite of me.

04:50.999 --> 04:56.755
If the MasterCard is in your name,
it's your responsibility.

04:56.922 --> 05:02.845
Listen, please. I came to New York
five years ago, to be an actress.

05:03.053 --> 05:07.683
I was in "Our Town". I played Emily.
People cried buckets.

05:07.850 --> 05:12.729
- I'm sure they were.
- Will there be anything else?

05:12.896 --> 05:17.067
So I come to New York,
and I meet Eddie.

05:17.234 --> 05:22.447
Talk about the worst luck of all!
He swept me off my feet.

05:22.614 --> 05:27.411
He bought me flowers,
he took me to real restaurants.

05:27.619 --> 05:31.039
With linen, wine and good lighting,
you know?

05:31.206 --> 05:36.253
It was perfect, except he turned out
to be a pathological liar.

05:36.420 --> 05:42.759
I believed every word he said,
because I had faith in people.

05:47.139 --> 05:52.519
So, in short...

05:52.686 --> 05:56.982
What are my options here?

06:19.713 --> 06:22.799
Charlie, Muriel and Yvonne
lived in a city -

06:22.966 --> 06:26.887
- where people pray
for miracles every day.

06:27.054 --> 06:30.641
Like winning
the $64-million lottery.

06:30.849 --> 06:37.731
My name is Angel. This story...
Well, it's pretty much all true.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.658
I had a dream last night. I got
three cherries on a slot machine, -

06:47.658 --> 06:51.745
I had a dream last night. I got
three cherries on a slot machine, -

06:51.912 --> 06:56.625
- but they were the face of
my dead father. It's a sign.

06:56.792 --> 07:02.422
- But you hated your father.
- No matter. A sign is a sign.

07:02.589 --> 07:07.469
- You think I'm nuts, but we'll win.
- I didn't say you were nuts.

07:07.636 --> 07:14.601
I said the odds of winning the
lottery are not overwhelming.

07:14.768 --> 07:19.022
One bedroom in Queens
is not my idea of living.

07:19.189 --> 07:25.696
One bedroom is fine. If we had kids,
it would be another story.

07:25.863 --> 07:30.492
- We can't afford to have kids.
- Of course we can!

07:30.701 --> 07:34.371
Cops have kids!
Firemen have kids...

07:34.538 --> 07:39.835
- That's why we have public schools.
- Just get the ticket!

07:40.002 --> 07:46.008
She's got to get real. You got to
tell her, "I'm out here every day, -

07:46.216 --> 07:52.055
- getting paid, bringing it home."
She's got to listen to you.

07:52.639 --> 07:57.352
- You can't be serious!
- It takes two minutes.

07:57.561 --> 08:00.397
I'm starving, man!

08:00.564 --> 08:06.987
This is police business, step aside.
It'll take two minutes...

08:07.154 --> 08:11.408
This will take forever. And
Burger King's another five blocks.

08:11.575 --> 08:17.915
- It's only across the street.
- What, that place? Oh, no...

08:25.839 --> 08:30.802
- Where the hell were you?
- I told you. A personal matter.

08:31.595 --> 08:36.558
- Then it comes off your pay cheque.
- But I have sick days coming!

08:36.725 --> 08:42.022
You want a sick day, get sick.
If you're healthy, you work.

08:42.188 --> 08:45.776
Get me some coffee.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.948
On your head, sweetie pie.

08:53.283 --> 08:58.872
- That guy sets a nice tone.
- Yeah, like a drill sergeant.

08:59.081 --> 09:01.875
Here we go.

09:06.171 --> 09:10.175
- You want some coffee?
- Please.

09:12.803 --> 09:18.350
- You guys know what you want?
- Cheeseburger and blueberry muffin.

09:22.604 --> 09:25.774
And you, Officer?

09:25.941 --> 09:30.654
You recommend
the lobster thermidor?

09:34.324 --> 09:38.453
That's really funny.
I'm gonna die laughing.

09:38.662 --> 09:44.042
- Especially today. What a treat!
- You've had a bad day?

09:46.587 --> 09:52.176
- Call me when you're ready.
- A meatball sandwich. Really!

09:54.011 --> 09:56.722
Meatball?

09:59.016 --> 10:02.352
You are very brave, Officer.

10:03.854 --> 10:10.777
- She likes you, she really does.
- I was trying to cheer her up.

10:10.944 --> 10:16.700
- Store alarm on Spring Street...
- Well, I'm full!

10:16.867 --> 10:20.370
I'm gonna starve to death.

10:22.706 --> 10:26.627
Your turn to pay.

10:28.587 --> 10:33.383
- Miss, we've got to run.
- After that whole routine?

10:33.550 --> 10:39.056
- When those radios go off...
- Where, where?

10:43.185 --> 10:48.899
Two coffees plus taxes...
Two, even.

10:54.738 --> 11:00.077
Oh, Jeez... I'm short.

11:00.244 --> 11:04.414
- Fine, Officer. No charge.
- No, it's the tip...

11:04.581 --> 11:09.086
- I'll live!
- I can't not leave a tip.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.926
A lottery ticket?

11:16.093 --> 11:20.973
With my luck? Go, get the cat
out of the tree, or whatever...

11:21.139 --> 11:25.435
No, that's the Fire Department.

11:25.602 --> 11:29.106
- Come on, Charlie!
- In a second.

11:29.314 --> 11:32.568
I got an idea.
What's your name?

11:33.610 --> 11:38.156
Yvonne? I'm Charlie Lang,
and we're partners.

11:38.323 --> 11:45.164
If I win, I give you half. If not,
I'll leave a tip. What do you think?

11:45.330 --> 11:48.333
- I'll never see you again.
- You'll see me tomorrow.

11:48.542 --> 11:53.589
- Well, I'll be here.
- You've got a deal.

12:09.980 --> 12:13.901
- All right, five more minutes.
- I ordered Chinese. Come up!

12:14.109 --> 12:16.862
- In a minute.
- Are you whipped?

12:17.029 --> 12:24.578
No, I've got adult responsibilities.
Next batter!

12:27.289 --> 12:31.543
That's it!
I'm out of here.

12:31.710 --> 12:37.799
- Jesu! Vien aqui, la comida.
- I'm coming, Mom!

12:38.008 --> 12:44.264
- Are you whipped, Jesu?
- It's my mother, that's different.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.603
Did you have surgery last night?

12:49.811 --> 12:54.691
You mean these?
No, it's just a prosthetic bra...

12:54.900 --> 12:59.863
Charlie, don't do that next to me!
That's disgusting.

13:00.072 --> 13:04.451
- I'm just soaking my feet.
- Please!

13:09.873 --> 13:14.503
- Since when did this bother you?
- Since now, okay?

13:14.711 --> 13:17.881
You're spilling water everywhere!

13:18.048 --> 13:23.262
I'll call the Red Cross
and tell them we're a disaster area.

13:23.428 --> 13:28.559
I have some larger ones
that I change into after work.

13:28.725 --> 13:33.230
Charlie...
Should I get my boobs done?

13:33.397 --> 13:38.527
- Done?
- Enlarged. So I could be like that.

13:41.655 --> 13:46.869
Are you nuts?
It seems so extreme.

13:47.035 --> 13:51.999
- Forget it.
- I just don't think you need it.

13:58.046 --> 14:01.800
Look, I had to declare bankruptcy.

14:02.009 --> 14:07.681
When will I be able
to get my MasterCard back?

14:13.478 --> 14:16.899
What are my chances?

14:18.025 --> 14:23.780
- Under 15,000 a year...
- Shall I speak to them? Love to.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.953
I see.

14:34.082 --> 14:38.629
Well, thank you.
That's what I thought.

14:38.795 --> 14:42.382
- What did they say?
- My chances are slim to none.

14:42.549 --> 14:46.303
The lotto jackpot has grown
to over $64 million.

14:46.512 --> 14:50.974
We'll check the winning numbers
when we return.

14:53.977 --> 14:58.690
- You got the numbers wrong!
- Wrong?

14:58.857 --> 15:05.197
- Our anniversary is the 27th.
- We always celebrate on the 26th.

15:05.405 --> 15:10.994
We got the licence on the 26th.
We got married on the 27th.

15:11.161 --> 15:16.124
- So why do we go out on the 26th?
- I don't know, maybe it's custom.

15:16.333 --> 15:20.254
The fact is,
I told you our anniversary.

15:20.462 --> 15:25.342
To anybody with any sense,
that means the day they got married.

15:25.551 --> 15:29.054
I am sorry, darling.

15:29.263 --> 15:32.432
Did he say 26?

15:32.599 --> 15:39.565
Those numbers again are:
6, 12, 16, 26, 64, 84.

15:40.816 --> 15:44.736
We won!
We got the jackpot!

15:46.488 --> 15:51.785
- That's unbelievable!
- We're rich!

15:51.952 --> 15:57.541
- The jackpot?
- We're rich, rich, rich!

15:57.708 --> 16:02.671
- What are we having?
- BLT down with turkey bacon.

16:02.838 --> 16:09.011
- Any Miracle Whip?
- Yes. No matter how broke I am.

16:09.178 --> 16:13.974
You have to have things
that are stable. Permanent.

16:14.183 --> 16:19.229
- Oreos, Smuckers...
- Exactly.

16:19.396 --> 16:23.859
- Thank you.
- Will there be anything else?

16:26.570 --> 16:30.073
Will there be anything else?

16:31.700 --> 16:34.578
There'll never be anything else.

16:34.745 --> 16:38.499
God, I hate this.
I feel bankrupt.

16:39.208 --> 16:41.960
What?

16:42.127 --> 16:45.964
A bowling team
had the same numbers!

16:46.173 --> 16:51.303
- They get nine million!
- Why am I not surprised?

16:51.470 --> 16:56.266
- How many are on the team?
- Average team is twelve guys.

16:56.433 --> 17:01.396
Do each of them get a piece,
or do you consider them as one?

17:01.563 --> 17:05.943
Muriel... your veins,
they're bulging out of your neck.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.029
You look like a psycho.

17:14.201 --> 17:19.498
Oh, my God. The bowlers,
thank God, only count as one.

17:19.665 --> 17:24.795
That's 16 people that picked
these numbers... Oh, God.

17:24.962 --> 17:27.881
That only leaves us with...

17:28.048 --> 17:30.968
Four million.

17:31.134 --> 17:35.430
We could live on that, right?

17:35.639 --> 17:39.226
We could live on less, even.

17:39.434 --> 17:45.232
Let's pray nobody else calls in,
so we don't have to split it again.

17:48.819 --> 17:52.739
What?

17:54.074 --> 17:58.954
What? You're making me nervous.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.836
Honey...

18:09.339 --> 18:13.427
I've got something to tell you.

18:16.221 --> 18:21.018
- A complete stranger? Charlie!
- I owed her a tip.

18:21.185 --> 18:24.855
A tip?
Two million dollars? Come on!

18:25.022 --> 18:28.358
I never thought we'd win, darling.

18:28.525 --> 18:34.198
- But we did win, like I said.
- But not with your numbers.

18:34.364 --> 18:38.368
Don't do that!
Because you know and I know -

18:38.535 --> 18:42.206
- that in my dream,
my dead father came.

18:42.372 --> 18:48.378
In his eyes he had dollar signs.
And a "4" in place of the pupil.

18:48.545 --> 18:53.675
That's ridiculous. He was a nut job,
he prayed to chickens.

18:53.884 --> 18:57.638
He wants us to have
the four million.

18:57.846 --> 19:04.561
If he intended us to have half,
there would have been a "2".

19:07.397 --> 19:11.401
It's not the right thing.

19:12.569 --> 19:16.615
The right thing?
What the hell is that?

19:16.823 --> 19:20.744
You've always done the right thing
for everybody else.

19:20.953 --> 19:26.458
Just once, please,
do the right thing for us.

19:26.625 --> 19:30.921
I gave her my word.

19:31.129 --> 19:37.719
- Honey... Do you love me?
- Of course I love you.

19:37.886 --> 19:43.642
Then stiff her. Stiff her
and smell the flowers. For me.

19:47.521 --> 19:52.317
- What would you do?
- I'd buy the Knicks.

19:52.526 --> 19:58.115
- I mean, about the girl.
- I'd take her to watch me play.

19:58.282 --> 20:02.619
I'd start myself as
a very small, round forward.

20:02.786 --> 20:06.623
So you agree with Muriel?
Giving her half is crazy?

20:06.790 --> 20:09.877
If I can't have the Knicks,
I want season tickets -

20:10.043 --> 20:14.840
- where you sit with Jack Nicholson
and Spike Lee.

20:16.008 --> 20:21.305
- A promise is a promise.
- And a stereo for the whole house.

20:21.471 --> 20:25.934
So you don't have to carry around
that boom box.

20:26.143 --> 20:30.063
I could tell her I just won $5,000.

20:30.230 --> 20:35.736
So... season tickets,
stereo system, Mazda GL6?

20:35.903 --> 20:41.825
- I couldn't just lie like that.
- A boat! I've never been on one.

20:41.992 --> 20:46.955
- Are you listening?
- You'll do the appropriate thing.

20:47.164 --> 20:51.460
- Which is?
- I don't know. That's your field.

20:59.927 --> 21:06.183
Tuna on whole wheat, one scrambled
soft, toast crisp, tea with lemon.

21:06.350 --> 21:10.521
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

21:13.440 --> 21:17.569
- You're back.
- I said I'd be back.

21:17.778 --> 21:21.281
- Coffee?
- No, thanks. I just wanted to...

21:21.448 --> 21:27.871
I'm sorry I was so rude yesterday.
But it was the worst day of my life.

21:28.038 --> 21:31.208
Yvonne, wake up!

21:31.375 --> 21:35.420
- You're all dreaming.
- Quit the socialising!

21:35.587 --> 21:39.842
Don't go,
I want to apologise in detail.

21:40.717 --> 21:46.640
Western for Walter. And for Timothy,
oatmeal like Mom used to make.

21:46.849 --> 21:51.812
My mother never made oatmeal.
She never made food in her life.

21:52.020 --> 21:56.149
Bloody Marys, she made.
White Russians...

21:56.358 --> 22:00.571
- But she had a great personality.
- So did lmelda Marcos.

22:00.737 --> 22:05.450
- She produced a nice son, right?
- You're okay.

22:05.659 --> 22:08.745
Eat!

22:11.290 --> 22:17.045
- He's got it, huh?
- Yeah, a couple of years.

22:17.212 --> 22:23.385
He's really starting to go downhill.
In and out of hospital...

22:23.552 --> 22:30.058
What a world! We should appreciate
every moment, not be spiteful.

22:30.267 --> 22:35.314
- I know just what you mean.
- Yvonne!

22:35.480 --> 22:38.984
Speaking of which...

22:41.445 --> 22:46.950
What I have is a bill for $9.53.
What I do not have is the $9.53!

22:47.159 --> 22:51.788
- He went to get his wallet...
- Never let them out the door!

22:51.997 --> 22:55.751
- What is this, a soup kitchen?
- I made a mistake.

22:55.959 --> 23:02.466
You sure did! The $9.53 comes out of
your cheque. Bring me some coffee.

23:19.858 --> 23:23.278
Let me!

23:29.201 --> 23:32.955
Enjoy!

23:36.166 --> 23:41.296
- Now that's coffee!
- So, what'll it be?

23:41.463 --> 23:45.384
- They're right there...
- Amazing, but true.

23:45.551 --> 23:50.681
- We've no cantelope or grapefruit.
- I'm not hungry.

23:50.848 --> 23:55.394
The thing is...
I got something for you.

23:56.645 --> 24:01.775
- For me?
- It's just a trifle.

24:05.946 --> 24:08.657
May I?

24:08.824 --> 24:15.539
It's a string for your glasses,
so they hang around your neck.

24:16.415 --> 24:20.961
So you'll know where they are.
At all times.

24:28.010 --> 24:32.890
This is... the nicest thing
anyone's ever gotten me.

24:34.224 --> 24:39.188
- I certainly hope not.
- It's close.

24:39.396 --> 24:43.066
You sure I can't get you anything?
Coffee?

24:43.233 --> 24:47.613
Decaf, please.
I've reached my target heart rate.

24:47.779 --> 24:51.200
Decaf it is!

24:52.493 --> 24:58.499
- So... You've had bad luck?
- Unbelievable!

24:58.707 --> 25:02.628
When I was eleven,
my dog died of parvo.

25:02.836 --> 25:07.132
I don't know to this day
what parvo is.

25:07.299 --> 25:13.388
I married the wrong man.
I mean the wrong, by a lot, man!

25:13.555 --> 25:19.645
Now I can't afford to get divorced.
I mean, I'm used to my luck...

25:19.811 --> 25:26.401
But yesterday, I went bankrupt
before I came into work.

25:27.945 --> 25:31.865
That's why I was so rude to you.

25:32.032 --> 25:35.118
You went bankrupt?

25:35.285 --> 25:39.122
- Look! From the officer.
- That's sweet, honey.

25:40.415 --> 25:44.336
About our little agreement...

25:46.129 --> 25:50.676
Double the tip, or
half of what I won in the lottery.

25:52.135 --> 25:56.348
- That agreement...
- Let's make it your choice.

25:56.515 --> 26:01.478
Door one, double the tip.
Door two, half my winnings.

26:01.645 --> 26:05.566
My choice? Okay...

26:05.774 --> 26:11.947
Whatever. I'll take door number two.
I'll take half of the lottery.

26:13.198 --> 26:18.078
- You're sure?
- Positive.

26:25.169 --> 26:29.423
- I hoped you'd say that.
- I'll bet! Better luck next time.

26:29.590 --> 26:33.510
Actually, we were pretty lucky.

26:33.677 --> 26:38.473
- Did you win something?
- We won something.

26:38.682 --> 26:42.186
We won something?
What did we win?

26:42.352 --> 26:45.939
Four million dollars.

26:50.861 --> 26:54.698
Why are you doing this?
This sick joke!

26:54.865 --> 27:02.581
- It's not a joke.
- No? What you're saying to me...

27:02.789 --> 27:06.710
You think I'm making this up?
I'm not! We won.

27:06.919 --> 27:13.258
The lottery? The actual New York
State lottery? Four million dollars?

27:13.425 --> 27:16.512
It happened last night.
It would have been more, -

27:16.720 --> 27:22.142
- but a bowling team took
about nine million out of the pot.

27:22.309 --> 27:27.189
And you're telling me that
you'll actually split it with me?

27:30.025 --> 27:33.695
A promise is a promise.

27:36.907 --> 27:40.494
Oh, my God...

27:41.829 --> 27:49.127
- You all right?
- Oh, my God!

27:58.303 --> 28:02.057
Now I know why
all these bad things happened.

28:02.266 --> 28:06.979
It's so stupendously, phenomenally,
unbelievably great!

28:07.145 --> 28:12.901
Because I had such bad luck...
Who wants ice cream?

28:13.443 --> 28:17.364
Who wants pie?

28:34.965 --> 28:40.721
Wait a minute!
I can't accept this, can I?

28:40.888 --> 28:46.310
I can't accept this!
I want to, so desperately, but...

28:46.476 --> 28:51.523
- This neurotic part of me says...
- Accept it!

28:51.690 --> 28:55.944
- How can I?
- I want you to have it.

28:56.111 --> 29:01.325
- With all my heart.
- Yvonne, take it!

29:07.581 --> 29:12.044
Muriel, $2 million is still
an enormous amount.

29:12.211 --> 29:16.340
You should be
committed to an asylum for life.

29:16.548 --> 29:24.348
They should give you a straitjacket
and take you to the loony bin!

29:25.474 --> 29:28.810
Look sweetheart,
you weren't there...

29:29.019 --> 29:33.232
She has customers with Al DS,
and treats them like an angel.

29:33.398 --> 29:39.321
- She's got a boss from hell...
- Why not give her all the money?

29:39.488 --> 29:42.699
- Get off my foot!
- We're doing the right thing.

29:42.866 --> 29:49.122
And the whole city will admire you.
You'll be a celebrity.

29:49.289 --> 29:53.126
Maybe I could get some
commercial endorsements?

29:53.293 --> 29:56.797
Absolutely. "Muriel Lang,
the woman with the heart of gold."

29:57.005 --> 30:03.971
You can endorse shampoos,
conditioners, nail polish...

30:04.179 --> 30:08.892
"Muriel Lang,
the woman with the heart of gold!"

30:09.059 --> 30:12.563
Well, I'd better get
something out of this.

30:14.857 --> 30:20.654
- Bowling for dollars!
- I want my cheque, Harry.

30:22.030 --> 30:26.326
Some of New York's luckiest people
are here in Manhattan -

30:26.535 --> 30:32.791
- to stake their claim in the
state's $64-million lotto jackpot.

30:32.958 --> 30:37.671
- So you promised Miss Biasi half?
- As a tip.

30:37.838 --> 30:42.551
A tip? We got a cop that gave
a waitress a $2-million tip!

30:42.759 --> 30:46.430
We're gonna open our own
bowling alley...

30:46.638 --> 30:50.225
- You insulted him.
- Next time, you talk!

30:50.434 --> 30:53.604
I'd like a little cottage
in the country.

30:59.443 --> 31:03.697
- Excuse me!
- Mrs. Lang, how do you feel?

31:03.864 --> 31:10.287
- I'm Mrs. Lang!
- Mrs. Lang? These are for you.

31:11.788 --> 31:17.294
- What an incredible woman you are.
- You have no idea!

31:17.461 --> 31:21.965
Does it bother you that he split
$4 million with a stranger?

31:22.132 --> 31:26.512
Not at all. In the beauty parlour,
I'm known as:

31:26.720 --> 31:30.974
"Muriel Lang,
the woman with the heart of gold."

31:31.141 --> 31:34.561
And if there are any sponsors
out there, like Denorex...

31:34.770 --> 31:38.106
Which I use, because...

31:38.315 --> 31:42.611
We've got to get the winners
in a group picture.

31:42.778 --> 31:46.365
- Miss Biasi, what will you buy?
- A car? An apartment?

31:46.573 --> 31:52.830
- I haven't thought about it yet.
- A promise is a promise.

31:52.996 --> 31:56.667
"Muriel Lang,
woman with the heart of gold."

31:56.834 --> 32:01.964
Oh, actress... briefly.
It didn't work out.

32:04.216 --> 32:08.595
"Denorex.
Works out each individual dandruff."

32:10.180 --> 32:14.393
- Will you stay on the force?
- I'll buy the force!

32:15.185 --> 32:19.189
- Yvonne?
- So it's "Yvonne" already?

32:19.356 --> 32:23.360
- Is this your biggest tip?
- Definitely!

32:29.658 --> 32:32.452
- Have you ever won before?
- Never!

32:32.619 --> 32:35.622
Big smile, everybody!

33:07.988 --> 33:13.452
She has no taste. That outfit
looked like it came from the 60's.

33:13.619 --> 33:17.456
I thought she looked just fine.

33:17.623 --> 33:20.876
She's not flashy.
She's just a waitress.

33:21.084 --> 33:25.214
Beauty is my business,
defer to my judgement.

33:25.380 --> 33:32.262
My God, it's Bendel's! What a
feeling, to come here with money.

33:33.597 --> 33:39.686
- God bless you.
- Stop giving it away to every bum!

33:43.315 --> 33:45.526
God bless you.

33:47.778 --> 33:52.407
- Now I'm happy.
- I'm glad, sweetheart.

33:55.828 --> 33:59.081
- Now I'm at peace with myself.
- I'm glad, sweetheart.

34:00.916 --> 34:04.336
Just a quick stop at Tiffany's,
and I'll be born again.

34:04.545 --> 34:09.007
Fur's for animals,
not for people!

34:55.512 --> 34:58.432
Excuse me.

35:35.552 --> 35:39.806
This is Eleanor Smith of
MasterCard. You are now eligible, -

35:39.973 --> 35:44.228
- Miss Yvonne Biasi,
for a $20, 000 line of credit.

35:44.394 --> 35:49.691
Please call me at 1-800-555-2000.

35:49.858 --> 35:55.155
- I've died and gone to heaven.
- Hi Yvonne, congratulations.

35:55.322 --> 36:01.078
My name is Paul, and I'd like you
to spank me with a wire brush.

36:01.245 --> 36:05.457
That's disgusting.

36:07.960 --> 36:13.382
- I've got to change my number.
- Hello, please leave a message.

36:14.758 --> 36:19.721
Hello? Sweetheart?
C'est moi!

36:19.930 --> 36:22.850
I'll bet you're there!

36:24.726 --> 36:27.604
I know you're mad about the account.

36:27.771 --> 36:32.651
- But I can explain.
- Stay out of my life, Eddie.

36:32.860 --> 36:35.320
You are there.
Hi, baby!

36:35.487 --> 36:39.324
The only reason you're calling
is the lottery.

36:39.491 --> 36:43.245
What? You won something?

36:43.453 --> 36:47.291
- Die!
- No, baby. I'm serious.

36:47.457 --> 36:52.588
I've been out of town.
The lottery? That's fabulous.

36:53.672 --> 36:57.593
You did good?

36:57.801 --> 37:00.012
I did all right.

37:00.220 --> 37:06.476
Well, that's great, baby. No one
deserves it more. I mean that.

37:06.643 --> 37:09.313
From the bottom of my heart.

37:11.356 --> 37:16.820
- Hello?
- Please, don't ever call me again.

37:24.495 --> 37:28.707
- When are you retiring?
- I'm not retiring! Get off my case.

37:28.874 --> 37:31.960
Where's that sense of humour?

37:32.169 --> 37:36.882
A guy calls at 3 a.m., says
he's holding a gun to his head...

37:37.049 --> 37:40.302
Unless you give him $1,000
he'll pull the trigger.

37:40.511 --> 37:44.515
If he called me at 3 a.m.,
I'd tell him to do it.

37:44.681 --> 37:49.144
- That really happen?
- Last night. This lottery thing...

37:49.353 --> 37:54.399
- You become this other person.
- I feel bad for you, baby.

37:54.608 --> 37:58.904
I'm not bad-mouthing it.
I'm just saying, it's an adjustment.

38:02.324 --> 38:05.327
Sun. How are things
in the mysterious East?

38:05.494 --> 38:10.290
- Very good. Very busy.
- No unjustified price increases?

38:10.499 --> 38:15.212
Good! Two coffees,
one regular, one light.

38:23.887 --> 38:28.517
- How's the wife?
- She has the flu.

38:44.533 --> 38:47.202
On the house.

38:47.369 --> 38:52.749
Thank you.
That's very sweet of you.

38:55.169 --> 38:58.839
Down there, make a right.

38:59.006 --> 39:03.719
Our favourite Korean
is getting robbed right now.

39:03.886 --> 39:08.223
- He said his wife has the flu.
- She'd work if she was dead!

39:08.390 --> 39:13.187
- Then he gives me coffee for free.
- Shit! How do we play it?

39:13.353 --> 39:18.233
Stay here, I'll go through the
basement. Call for some back-up.

39:20.068 --> 39:23.655
Faster!

39:24.281 --> 39:27.868
Nobody moves!
A carton of Virginia Slims!

39:49.806 --> 39:52.768
That cop's just sitting out there.

39:52.935 --> 39:56.605
Don't worry about the cop.

39:58.482 --> 40:01.401
What was that?

40:01.610 --> 40:05.614
Come here.
Watch him!

40:07.741 --> 40:11.245
Come on, pal. Move!

40:17.042 --> 40:19.837
- What's back there?
- Nothing.

40:20.003 --> 40:24.508
- What about that door?
- Basement. Just rats.

40:24.675 --> 40:26.969
- Rats?
- Big ones.

40:27.135 --> 40:31.515
I hate rats.
Don't you keep this place clean?

40:37.896 --> 40:40.440
Nobody move!

40:42.734 --> 40:45.362
What's with this cop?

40:45.529 --> 40:49.741
He's got nothing better to do
than write tickets?

40:49.908 --> 40:53.162
With all the crime in this city?

40:53.370 --> 41:00.294
- What do we do?
- Wait, till he leaves.

41:00.460 --> 41:07.050
- What if he doesn't leave?
- He'll leave. Just shut up!

41:17.102 --> 41:21.190
- What's the matter?
- I think it's a heart attack.

41:23.567 --> 41:27.905
- Shut up!
- Call a doctor.

41:28.071 --> 41:31.658
I'm the doctor here, honey!

41:48.050 --> 41:52.596
Get up, Charlie!
You all right?

41:52.804 --> 41:57.851
Get inside,
there's another one inside.

41:58.060 --> 42:01.647
Come on, Charlie, get up.
You all right?

42:03.023 --> 42:07.736
- Why didn't you just shoot him?
- Too many customers.

42:07.945 --> 42:12.991
- You all right, man?
- Yeah... I'm great.

42:18.789 --> 42:21.416
Oh man, you got shot!

42:23.836 --> 42:29.550
He saved lives and prevented
injuries, though not to himself.

42:29.716 --> 42:33.387
And certainly not
to the criminals he stopped.

42:33.595 --> 42:38.725
So I give to Officer Charles Lang
this citation for bravery, -

42:38.892 --> 42:42.145
- and wish him a quick recovery.

42:43.480 --> 42:47.317
Thank you very much.

42:49.319 --> 42:54.533
I guess fate's telling me to
take it easy. Or so says my wife.

42:56.618 --> 43:00.664
I love being a cop,
lottery or no lottery.

43:00.831 --> 43:04.334
I think it's the
most important job in the world.

43:04.501 --> 43:10.757
So I'll be donating $10,000
to the Policemen's Widows' Fund.

43:12.968 --> 43:16.013
Thanks a lot!

43:18.557 --> 43:22.227
You're too young
to be hanging around.

43:22.436 --> 43:25.689
I'm injured.
Don't you read the papers?

43:25.898 --> 43:31.236
- You're a hero? Play with one hand.
- If I could, I would.

43:31.403 --> 43:34.615
- See you.
- Yeah, see you later.

43:53.675 --> 43:57.012
Good afternoon, sir.

44:01.308 --> 44:06.355
- This looks like Beirut!
- Isn't it great?

44:06.563 --> 44:11.026
We'll go co-op next year,
and sell the apartment.

44:11.193 --> 44:16.240
- Mr. Patel told me.
- Hi, I'm your accountant.

44:16.406 --> 44:20.702
- All the best on your new fortune.
- Thank you.

44:20.869 --> 44:26.375
- He says we'll get $100,000 for it.
- Minimum!

44:26.542 --> 44:30.295
And we beat the taxes
if we move to Jersey.

44:30.504 --> 44:36.343
- But I want to stay here.
- And do what? Play stickball?

44:38.887 --> 44:42.391
It's the architect.
Excuse me!

44:42.599 --> 44:45.769
- Where's my chair?
- I gave it to Goodwill.

44:45.978 --> 44:50.440
But I loved that chair!
You could have asked me.

44:52.609 --> 44:57.656
Why should I? You're the one
that loves to give everything away.

44:58.323 --> 45:03.954
Women! Who can live with them?
And without them?

45:04.121 --> 45:05.956
What?

45:13.463 --> 45:17.593
Gray's Antiques
had another break-in.

45:17.759 --> 45:22.139
Two brothers walked off
with a Biedermeyer chest.

45:22.306 --> 45:26.435
Gray says, "How could
black guys know what it's worth?"

45:26.602 --> 45:30.355
He said that?
What did you say?

45:30.564 --> 45:36.153
"They must get the African-American
Antiques Newsletter."

45:36.320 --> 45:39.573
He pissed me off.

45:41.825 --> 45:45.996
- I miss you, man.
- I'm going out of my mind.

45:46.163 --> 45:50.542
My house is a wreck,
and I've got nothing to do...

45:50.751 --> 45:55.297
Well, that's retirement.

45:55.506 --> 46:02.095
- Well! "Yvonne's".
- She bought it a few weeks ago.

46:02.304 --> 46:07.351
- Can I get you anything else?
- Tea, please.

46:07.518 --> 46:11.355
Eight wants tea.

46:14.483 --> 46:17.903
- How's the soup?
- Not enough basil.

46:18.070 --> 46:22.199
You're kidding...
I'll see what I can do.

46:22.366 --> 46:27.871
- Go in. Say hello.
- Forget it, she's busy.

46:28.038 --> 46:32.459
I know you're dying to go in there.

46:33.544 --> 46:37.923
No, I've got to get home.
But I got you something.

46:38.090 --> 46:41.093
Season tickets to the Knicks.

46:41.260 --> 46:45.556
- They're not on the floor...
- Knicks tickets? For me?

46:45.764 --> 46:51.103
- I couldn't get the floor.
- Don't worry, give me some!

46:51.270 --> 46:55.566
- Knicks tickets!
- I'm glad she's doing well.

47:07.202 --> 47:10.455
Why the coat?
It's a warm night.

47:10.664 --> 47:13.834
Maybe I'll get a chill later.
Just hold it.

47:24.469 --> 47:28.515
- There's a lot of people here.
- Isn't it great?

47:28.682 --> 47:33.145
I feel like
we're at the Academy Awards.

47:33.353 --> 47:37.691
I'm going to go circulate.

47:48.452 --> 47:51.955
Here's your lipstick.

47:53.165 --> 47:57.794
I won $55 million, and
increased my net worth 40 percent -

47:57.961 --> 48:00.881
- through well-chosen mutual funds.

48:01.048 --> 48:05.511
- 40 percent?
- At virtually no risk.

48:05.761 --> 48:11.308
S & L funds, Biotech funds...
Gold funds, they were a disaster.

48:11.475 --> 48:16.355
- Stay away from those.
- What about Treasury Bills?

48:16.563 --> 48:22.110
They're for little old ladies.
Which you certainly are not.

48:22.277 --> 48:25.781
Aren't you a tiger!

48:49.888 --> 48:54.101
Why can't you change 20 dollars?
You drive all day!

48:54.309 --> 48:59.606
- We go get change.
- No, you have to break this.

48:59.773 --> 49:02.734
Hi!

49:03.026 --> 49:06.947
Hi... Can you break a 20?

49:13.745 --> 49:17.666
Repeat after me:
"Keep the change."

49:17.833 --> 49:21.879
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

49:26.383 --> 49:31.722
- Oh my God, the boat!
- Oh, no! Wait!

49:44.067 --> 49:47.905
I suppose your wife is...

49:48.113 --> 49:52.910
She's in her element. Stockbrokers,
accountants. She'll enjoy it.

49:53.076 --> 49:58.999
- What about you?
- I hate boats. I'm relieved.

50:01.168 --> 50:05.255
- I think this is sturgeon.
- Definitely not.

50:06.048 --> 50:10.135
- It's like velvet.
- Scottish salmon. The very best.

50:10.302 --> 50:12.513
More champagne?

50:12.721 --> 50:18.268
- It's not bad, for a Californian.
- You're not kidding. Fooled me.

50:19.603 --> 50:23.649
- This is living.
- And it's just beginning.

50:23.816 --> 50:29.488
- You can say that again!
- And it's just beginning.

50:36.912 --> 50:39.289
Thank you.

50:43.961 --> 50:49.174
It's a pleasure to have you here.
A cocktail? Some champagne?

50:49.383 --> 50:53.762
Champagne? Champagne.

50:55.138 --> 51:01.645
- You decided not to be an actress?
- I decided to become a waitress.

51:01.812 --> 51:05.816
I had the "tress" part right.

51:05.983 --> 51:09.653
And I was a great waitress.

51:09.862 --> 51:12.948
I saw you bought the place.

51:13.115 --> 51:18.579
- I passed by the other day.
- And you didn't come in?

51:18.745 --> 51:23.542
Well, I... I figured you were busy.

51:23.709 --> 51:28.005
Please, you have to come in
and see what I did.

51:28.172 --> 51:33.552
I have a table with your name on it,
for people who can't afford a meal.

51:34.803 --> 51:37.931
Of course.
After what you did.

51:38.098 --> 51:42.978
What I did? I made a promise
and I kept it, period.

51:43.187 --> 51:47.649
- Most people would do the same.
- Nobody would!

51:48.567 --> 51:54.323
Are you kidding?
What you did was like a fairy tale.

51:58.535 --> 52:04.041
And everyone gets to
live happily ever after?

52:18.555 --> 52:23.769
- Well, that's a hopeful sight.
- You think?

52:23.936 --> 52:28.065
I always wonder...
What's in store for them?

52:28.273 --> 52:31.360
Are they going to be happy?

52:31.527 --> 52:36.907
If she puts on 50 pounds,
will he love her anyway?

52:37.825 --> 52:43.038
- How long were you married?
- Three years.

52:44.164 --> 52:47.751
To an actor named Eddie.

52:47.918 --> 52:52.881
Who suggested, if we had a child,
that we name him Al Pacino.

52:54.925 --> 53:01.181
- Al Pacino Biasi.
- Come on!

53:17.406 --> 53:22.369
Muriel and I met in high school,
in one of those cooking classes -

53:22.578 --> 53:27.916
- where the boys dress like chefs.
And there might be a fire drill...

53:28.083 --> 53:35.299
- And you're outside in your aprons?
- Exactly. Even now, I get chills.

53:35.465 --> 53:39.761
Anyhow, we started dating, and...

53:43.640 --> 53:46.560
Muriel was the first girl I ever...

53:48.270 --> 53:51.607
Really?

53:51.815 --> 53:57.362
- Oh. Well, that's sweet.
- I guess.

53:58.989 --> 54:04.328
We went to get the marriage licence,
and there was this other couple...

54:04.495 --> 54:08.790
Orthodox Jews.
It was an arranged marriage.

54:08.999 --> 54:14.838
They weren't allowed to see each
other. They couldn't get a glimpse.

54:15.047 --> 54:20.719
And I thought, "They don't
even know if they're attracted."

54:20.886 --> 54:25.849
"They don't know if they've
got anything to talk about."

54:26.058 --> 54:32.231
Now, ten years later, I bet they're
happily married with six kids.

54:32.397 --> 54:38.904
But Muriel and I have nothing
to say. I don't know what happened.

54:39.071 --> 54:43.951
We're on two different channels.
I'm CN N, she's "Home Shopping".

55:08.183 --> 55:12.229
How would you feel about dancing?

55:15.232 --> 55:19.278
Oh, I'd... be in favour of it.

56:38.524 --> 56:43.070
When I was on night shift,
I felt like an explorer.

56:43.278 --> 56:48.075
There's this whole other city
that goes on all night long.

56:48.242 --> 56:51.995
- Am I talking incessantly?
- Yes.

56:52.204 --> 56:56.667
But I like it.
I myself am a talker.

56:56.834 --> 57:03.006
It's nice to meet somebody you
can just talk with, and hang with.

57:03.882 --> 57:09.513
Look... here's the thing.
I'm free all the time, basically.

57:09.680 --> 57:14.643
So if you ever want to do something,
or you want company...

57:14.810 --> 57:20.232
Really?
How about tomorrow?

57:20.399 --> 57:23.819
- Too soon?
- No, not at all.

57:24.027 --> 57:29.158
Okay, great. I'll have
Carol watch the register, -

57:29.324 --> 57:33.245
- and you could pick me up at noon?

57:33.412 --> 57:36.373
I'll be there.

57:39.209 --> 57:42.212
Goodnight.

57:55.809 --> 58:01.231
Weirdest thing happened.
I thought I'd dropped my wallet.

58:01.398 --> 58:06.695
Weirdest thing happened.
I came out because I felt seasick.

58:10.407 --> 58:12.367
Weirdest thing happened...

58:12.534 --> 58:12.576
- I have some ideas for you...
- Weirdest thing happened.

58:12.576 --> 58:17.206
- I have some ideas for you...
- Weirdest thing happened.

58:18.165 --> 58:21.084
Wasn't the veal fabulous?

58:21.251 --> 58:26.298
That was what was so weird.
I expected chicken.

58:26.465 --> 58:29.968
I would have come sit with you,
but Mr. Gross...

58:30.177 --> 58:33.764
Jack Gross.
Pleased to meet you, Officer.

58:33.931 --> 58:37.851
He's going to help us develop
an economic strategy.

58:38.018 --> 58:43.649
- What a great idea.
- She's some girl. Smart.

58:44.817 --> 58:48.737
Beautiful...
And she knows what she wants.

58:48.946 --> 58:52.282
- See?
- I agree.

58:52.491 --> 58:58.121
Thank you very much for a
very stimulating evening, Mr. Gross.

58:58.288 --> 59:02.918
- If you ever need any advice...
- I will be calling.

59:05.128 --> 59:07.673
Ready?

59:07.881 --> 59:12.761
- I got to get my coat.
- Bye-bye.

59:29.820 --> 59:33.991
- You're doing great!
- I never had great balance.

59:34.158 --> 59:38.245
I tried skiing. They threw me off
the "Peter Rabbit" slope.

59:38.412 --> 59:43.041
- Your knees. That's the problem.
- One of them!

59:43.250 --> 59:49.673
There's a little bit of a hill here,
so you might want to watch it.

59:49.882 --> 59:52.843
- Slow down!
- I can't.

59:53.010 --> 59:56.346
- Sure you can!
- Sure I can't!

01:00:00.893 --> 01:00:03.770
Charlie, turn!

01:00:10.611 --> 01:00:14.364
- Are you okay?
- Fine.

01:00:14.531 --> 01:00:19.661
I'll catch leprosy from the water,
but otherwise I'm okay.

01:00:19.870 --> 01:00:24.500
So I guess this is it
for you and rollerblading?

01:00:24.666 --> 01:00:27.044
I would have to say yes.

01:00:28.879 --> 01:00:34.885
Okay, your turn. What next?
What do you want to do?

01:00:42.267 --> 01:00:46.897
Ladies and gentlemen,
I've just won the lottery.

01:00:47.105 --> 01:00:52.069
Tonight's ride home is on me
and Miss Yvonne Biasi.

01:00:58.951 --> 01:01:02.454
- What's going on?
- They're treating everybody.

01:01:15.425 --> 01:01:20.973
- This is going to be hard to top.
- I'll top it.

01:01:26.186 --> 01:01:30.899
Welcome to Charlie Lang,
Yvonne Biasi, -

01:01:31.108 --> 01:01:34.611
- Officer Bo Williams -

01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:39.783
- and all the kids
from Woodside, Queens.

01:02:24.077 --> 01:02:27.915
I know, I know.
I'm trying.

01:04:15.939 --> 01:04:21.320
It was a great day for me, too.

01:04:22.613 --> 01:04:28.452
- What the hell is she doing?
- She's pissed, whatever it is.

01:04:33.123 --> 01:04:38.795
- Congratulations, Mr. Token Man.
- Oh God!

01:05:13.997 --> 01:05:19.586
- Honey, I'm home.
- No, you have to leave.

01:05:19.795 --> 01:05:24.508
- Stop eating my macadamia nuts!
- Give me a kiss.

01:05:24.675 --> 01:05:30.931
- You can't stay here. Out!
- Why? You expecting company?

01:05:31.098 --> 01:05:35.185
Not Officer Krupke, the saintly cop?

01:05:35.352 --> 01:05:39.189
There's nothing going on.
And he's not a saint, -

01:05:39.356 --> 01:05:43.986
- simply a decent human being.
Something you couldn't...

01:05:44.194 --> 01:05:46.655
If you eat one more of those...

01:05:47.739 --> 01:05:53.036
- Are you having an affair?
- No, we just hang out together.

01:05:53.203 --> 01:05:57.833
You should have heard that bitch
downstairs talking about it.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:04.006
What's the real issue here? Us,
or what some idiot neighbour thinks?

01:06:04.173 --> 01:06:08.385
It's been like a cold war.
If I try to talk about it, you...

01:06:08.552 --> 01:06:13.265
- I just tried to make you happy.
- No, that's not all.

01:06:13.474 --> 01:06:16.977
I used to come home,
and you'd hug me.

01:06:17.144 --> 01:06:22.900
You'd kiss me and ask how my
day was. When did you do that last?

01:06:23.066 --> 01:06:27.279
It's not important.
It's history.

01:06:27.446 --> 01:06:31.575
- You go around with this girl!
- I'm not having an affair.

01:06:31.742 --> 01:06:36.705
This thing between you and the cop
is none of my business.

01:06:36.914 --> 01:06:41.627
But... there is one thing
that's very important. This:

01:06:41.793 --> 01:06:44.588
Don't be afraid.

01:06:44.755 --> 01:06:50.511
"The Eddie Biasi Players!"

01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:57.768
You want money.
Of course you want money.

01:06:57.935 --> 01:07:03.607
Just fifty grand in seed money.
Then we're off. Picture this...

01:07:03.774 --> 01:07:10.030
Of course not. Not Mr. Saintly.
You're too good to have an affair.

01:07:10.197 --> 01:07:14.827
I'm just so sick of it!
Your niceness and decency.

01:07:15.035 --> 01:07:20.791
You're nothing. A working-class
stiff. Blue collar all the way.

01:07:27.422 --> 01:07:31.677
I'm not gonna change, Muriel.

01:07:33.512 --> 01:07:36.765
I know.

01:07:37.975 --> 01:07:42.938
- So I want a divorce.
- You want a divorce?

01:07:43.147 --> 01:07:45.691
As soon as possible.

01:07:45.858 --> 01:07:51.864
I have wings, Charlie.
I want to fly.

01:08:00.205 --> 01:08:03.876
Honey?

01:08:04.042 --> 01:08:10.632
The bottom line is, I'm
sticking around until you kick in.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.887
You stick around.
I'm out of here.

01:08:15.053 --> 01:08:20.809
Where are you going, big shot?
The Plaza?

01:08:21.018 --> 01:08:23.395
Yeah, the Plaza.

01:08:23.604 --> 01:08:27.774
If you're here when I get back,
I'll call the cops.

01:08:27.941 --> 01:08:33.238
And believe me, I am now
in a position to get them to come.

01:08:44.582 --> 01:08:49.712
- Where you going?
- A hotel.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:53.383
- You mean, you and her...
- We're history.

01:08:53.591 --> 01:08:59.515
- Can't say I'm surprised.
- No? It's funny, I am.

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:04.728
No matter what comes before,
you don't expect this.

01:09:04.895 --> 01:09:10.234
- What hotel, Charlie?
- The Holiday Inn on Ninth.

01:09:10.399 --> 01:09:15.197
Holiday Inn?
Charlie, you won the lottery.

01:09:15.404 --> 01:09:19.910
One night at least,
stay at the Plaza.

01:09:21.411 --> 01:09:27.084
Maybe I will.
You're a real pal, you know that?

01:09:27.251 --> 01:09:30.504
I'll see you guys.

01:09:56.738 --> 01:09:59.283
Good evening.

01:09:59.449 --> 01:10:03.787
I'd like to get a room.

01:10:04.288 --> 01:10:08.834
I'm not that waitress,
if that's what you're thinking.

01:10:09.042 --> 01:10:11.712
I didn't think so.

01:10:11.879 --> 01:10:16.758
- Single or double?
- A single.

01:10:17.593 --> 01:10:21.805
- Smoking or non-smoking?
- Non-smoking.

01:10:23.015 --> 01:10:27.311
Sir, can I help you?

01:10:41.366 --> 01:10:46.330
- He moved back in.
- She threw me out.

01:10:46.538 --> 01:10:50.375
811 is this way, ma'am.

01:10:52.294 --> 01:10:57.841
Sir?
If you'll just follow me...

01:11:37.714 --> 01:11:42.344
- That was the cop.
- That's the waitress.

01:12:00.696 --> 01:12:04.741
Checked your bathroom yet?
There's a robe.

01:12:04.908 --> 01:12:09.079
- Are you serious?
- Swear to God!

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:17.462
- Well... goodnight.
- Come in.

01:12:23.844 --> 01:12:31.059
Unbelievable! Your room is exactly
like mine, just a different colour.

01:12:31.268 --> 01:12:35.397
Would you like some fruit?

01:12:35.564 --> 01:12:42.237
You have some in your room.
Every room probably has fruit.

01:12:42.821 --> 01:12:46.950
- There's really a robe?
- Terry cloth.

01:12:47.117 --> 01:12:52.247
Nice... really nice.

01:12:52.414 --> 01:12:58.754
It's for sale. You can buy it
for like $100. I think it's $100.

01:12:58.962 --> 01:13:02.883
I'll do it.

01:13:03.091 --> 01:13:08.138
I'll split it with you. We'll share.
You have it one month, then me...

01:13:08.347 --> 01:13:15.646
- Or every other day, or weekends.
- Or we could get two.

01:13:28.033 --> 01:13:32.329
- Why am I so nervous?
- I don't know.

01:13:32.538 --> 01:13:39.127
- We've spent so much time together.
- Maybe that's why.

01:14:26.592 --> 01:14:28.468
Here we go...

01:14:29.511 --> 01:14:32.848
There they are!

01:14:43.525 --> 01:14:47.779
- Unbelievable!
- Make yourselves comfortable.

01:14:47.946 --> 01:14:51.533
- I mean, I've seen some offices...
- Walter, please.

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:56.663
They must charge you an arm
and a leg. Just the chairs...

01:14:56.830 --> 01:15:01.126
- A glass of water?
- Real leather. I thought so.

01:15:01.293 --> 01:15:06.340
- Where's Muriel?
- Mrs. Lang just stepped out.

01:15:07.716 --> 01:15:10.260
And here she is.

01:15:11.804 --> 01:15:17.434
- You had them done.
- Had what done?

01:15:17.601 --> 01:15:22.105
- Can we proceed?
- What did she have done?

01:15:22.272 --> 01:15:27.236
- I'll tell you later.
- Let's cut to the chase.

01:15:27.444 --> 01:15:32.741
The lottery money should not be
divided. It was Mrs. Lang's ticket.

01:15:32.908 --> 01:15:37.162
- Completely unacceptable.
- It's all right.

01:15:37.329 --> 01:15:40.749
She can have my half.

01:15:41.625 --> 01:15:45.462
Come here.

01:15:45.629 --> 01:15:50.175
Are you nuts?
You're giving up without a fight?

01:15:50.342 --> 01:15:53.929
She can have my half, period.

01:15:54.138 --> 01:15:58.642
- You're talking a million dollars!
- Walter, please!

01:15:58.809 --> 01:16:02.479
You got to be kidding me!

01:16:04.481 --> 01:16:10.654
- We concede the point.
- That's a very mature attitude.

01:16:10.821 --> 01:16:18.620
As to their pre-lottery holdings,
we have a bank account totalling...

01:16:19.955 --> 01:16:27.671
...$3,611.
I insist we split this 50-50.

01:16:29.131 --> 01:16:32.050
Chump change.

01:16:32.217 --> 01:16:38.724
That's basically it. There's
furnishings, some good linens...

01:16:38.932 --> 01:16:42.352
Not quite accurate, Mr. Zakuto.

01:16:42.519 --> 01:16:49.193
We are also attaching the monies
given by Mr. Lang to Miss Biasi.

01:16:49.359 --> 01:16:52.196
That is out of bounds!

01:16:52.362 --> 01:16:58.368
Mr. Lang volunteered his wife's
earnings without her consent.

01:16:58.577 --> 01:17:04.041
That's horrible, Muriel. Please,
think about what you're doing.

01:17:04.208 --> 01:17:08.295
We believe that he and Miss Biasi
had a long-standing relationship -

01:17:08.462 --> 01:17:12.466
- that he deliberately
deceived his wife about.

01:17:12.633 --> 01:17:16.720
And we have drafted a letter
to Miss Biasi -

01:17:16.887 --> 01:17:22.518
- demanding that she return the
money in full, or face penalties.

01:17:22.684 --> 01:17:27.147
- I can't believe this!
- I can't listen to this screaming.

01:17:27.981 --> 01:17:32.402
- Our whole marriage was like this.
- It was not.

01:17:32.569 --> 01:17:35.322
Is this just to get even
with Yvonne?

01:17:35.531 --> 01:17:40.953
I am tired of your physical abuse.
Did you see that?

01:17:43.789 --> 01:17:49.127
If you fellows need a cab,
my secretary will call one.

01:17:50.462 --> 01:17:55.092
How am I going to say this
to Yvonne?

01:17:55.259 --> 01:18:00.597
You'll have to stop
seeing her for a while.

01:18:04.434 --> 01:18:11.567
This is Yvonne Biasi. Please
leave a message after the beep.

01:18:11.733 --> 01:18:15.779
Yvonne, I just wanted to say
I'm thinking about you.

01:18:15.988 --> 01:18:20.450
We'll win this, because it's right.
It's not your fault.

01:18:20.617 --> 01:18:27.207
I'm at Bo's at 555-3840.
I guess I'll see you in court.

01:18:27.416 --> 01:18:31.712
I hope you don't mind
sleeping on the floor.

01:18:31.879 --> 01:18:38.927
- There's beer in the fridge.
- Thanks for the blanket, Tracey.

01:18:40.262 --> 01:18:45.142
Goodnight, Gail.
I'm sorry.

01:19:02.826 --> 01:19:09.708
"The trial, which has attracted
citywide interest, begins today."

01:19:09.875 --> 01:19:14.922
- This whole thing is unbelievable!
- My money's on Yvonne.

01:19:15.839 --> 01:19:22.012
- What are your birthday's numbers?
- 12, 16, 64.

01:19:22.179 --> 01:19:26.809
12... 16... 64.

01:19:27.017 --> 01:19:33.774
And the numbers for
your anniversary, my dear?

01:19:36.443 --> 01:19:39.530
6, 26, 84.

01:19:39.696 --> 01:19:43.116
6, 26...

01:19:44.493 --> 01:19:49.039
Did I hear 26?

01:19:49.206 --> 01:19:54.628
As a matter of fact,
weren't you married on the 27th?

01:19:55.379 --> 01:19:59.842
- Yes.
- So your husband picked 26?

01:20:00.008 --> 01:20:05.222
- Objection. What's the point?
- The point is, Counsellor...

01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:08.934
The point is, Your Honour...
I am demonstrating -

01:20:09.143 --> 01:20:14.898
- that Mr. Lang is responsible
for the winning ticket.

01:20:15.065 --> 01:20:18.318
Overruled.

01:20:18.527 --> 01:20:24.950
So, Mrs. Lang, your husband
picked the 26th on his own, correct?

01:20:25.117 --> 01:20:28.620
- No.
- No?

01:20:28.829 --> 01:20:33.709
There was you...
there was your husband...

01:20:33.917 --> 01:20:38.547
Who else was there that morning?

01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:47.097
My dead father.

01:20:51.351 --> 01:20:57.858
- Excuse me?
- My dead father, God rest his soul.

01:20:58.025 --> 01:21:03.697
He came to me in a dream. "Baby",
he said, floating out the window.

01:21:03.906 --> 01:21:10.787
He had these big angel wings,
the perfect colour of white leather.

01:21:10.954 --> 01:21:16.460
He says, "Baby, it's time to go
to the church. You'll be late."

01:21:16.627 --> 01:21:22.216
To my shock, I'm standing there
in my wedding gown.

01:21:22.382 --> 01:21:28.472
So I run down Queen's Boulevard,
through Flatbush... impossible!

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:33.894
I came to the church:
St. Catherine's of the Holy Lotto.

01:21:34.061 --> 01:21:39.650
And then I realised I wasn't late,
I was a whole day early.

01:21:39.817 --> 01:21:42.653
God, I wanted to die!

01:21:42.820 --> 01:21:47.115
Then my father was standing
right next to me.

01:21:47.282 --> 01:21:51.036
And he says,
"Little girl, don't cry."

01:21:51.203 --> 01:21:58.418
"Because to me, your anniversary
will always be on the 26th."

01:21:58.669 --> 01:22:03.632
M U RI EL'S DREAM
DEAD FATH ER PICKED WI N N ERS

01:22:08.804 --> 01:22:11.849
Mr. Lang.

01:22:12.015 --> 01:22:17.396
Have you ever purchased
nail polish remover for your wife?

01:22:17.563 --> 01:22:20.482
Quiet, please!

01:22:22.234 --> 01:22:25.320
Nail polish remover?

01:22:26.488 --> 01:22:30.492
- A couple of times, I guess.
- And you paid for it?

01:22:30.659 --> 01:22:35.038
Did you therefore consider it yours?

01:22:35.205 --> 01:22:38.709
No, I guess I didn't.

01:22:39.376 --> 01:22:43.839
Did you force your wife
to split the ticket with Miss Biasi?

01:22:44.047 --> 01:22:47.801
I only said
we should do the right thing.

01:22:48.010 --> 01:22:52.389
- Were you wearing a gun?
- Of course not.

01:22:52.598 --> 01:22:57.144
- You hit her, didn't you?
- I never, ever...

01:22:57.352 --> 01:23:01.648
You are under oath, Mr. Lang!

01:23:02.941 --> 01:23:09.531
- Okay, once I grabbed her arm...
- No further questions.

01:23:13.202 --> 01:23:17.331
Your witness, Counsellor.

01:23:18.707 --> 01:23:24.129
Miss Biasi. Would you describe
your financial circumstances -

01:23:24.296 --> 01:23:29.593
- before Mr. Lang offered you
half his wife's winning ticket?

01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:33.096
I was struggling to make ends meet.

01:23:33.263 --> 01:23:38.060
Isn't it a fact you owed $12,000
on your MasterCard?

01:23:38.268 --> 01:23:43.482
- That's because my ex-husband...
- Just answer yes or no.

01:23:43.649 --> 01:23:48.111
Technically, yes.
But I hadn't overspent.

01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:53.951
Didn't you go bankrupt the same day
he offered to split the ticket?

01:23:55.410 --> 01:24:00.624
Yes.
But that was just... fate.

01:24:00.833 --> 01:24:05.963
- Right, fate...
- Yes. Really.

01:24:06.129 --> 01:24:11.176
What was your relationship with
Mr. Lang when he made his offer?

01:24:11.343 --> 01:24:15.556
- I'd never met him before.
- Really?

01:24:15.764 --> 01:24:18.642
Yes, really.

01:24:18.809 --> 01:24:23.355
Describe your relationship
with Mr. Lang today.

01:24:27.734 --> 01:24:31.822
I love him more than
anything in the world.

01:24:31.989 --> 01:24:36.785
And you went to the Plaza
with him the day he left his wife.

01:24:36.994 --> 01:24:42.583
- Objection! What is the relevancy?
- Motivation.

01:24:42.749 --> 01:24:49.339
Mrs. Lang had thrown him out,
the marriage was in ruins...

01:24:49.506 --> 01:24:54.928
They're trying to make me into a
gold-digger... him, the media...

01:24:55.095 --> 01:24:57.389
Control yourself, please.

01:24:57.556 --> 01:25:02.519
I've worked all my life. Finally
something wonderful happened.

01:25:02.686 --> 01:25:07.483
I met a man who was intelligent,
kind and compassionate.

01:25:07.649 --> 01:25:11.320
Just knowing him has
changed my life. It's not the money.

01:25:11.487 --> 01:25:15.949
He made me believe
people were fundamentally decent.

01:25:16.158 --> 01:25:20.287
I won't let some lawyer
make our relationship look ugly.

01:25:20.454 --> 01:25:25.417
Are you divorced?

01:25:25.626 --> 01:25:29.046
You're married to one man,
and in love with another.

01:25:29.213 --> 01:25:35.803
- I couldn't afford to get divorced.
- Well, that's convenient!

01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:42.059
In dramatic testimony,
Yvonne Biasi was depicted -

01:25:42.226 --> 01:25:47.356
- as a gold-digging nymphomaniac.
A verdict is expected tonight.

01:25:48.482 --> 01:25:53.779
- Has the jury reached a verdict?
- We have, Your Honour.

01:26:08.710 --> 01:26:11.588
What say you?

01:26:11.755 --> 01:26:17.094
We rule in favour of the plaintiff,
Mrs. Muriel Lang, on all counts.

01:26:18.053 --> 01:26:22.516
The court would like to thank
the jury for its service.

01:26:22.683 --> 01:26:25.394
Court dismissed.

01:26:45.873 --> 01:26:51.295
- About your affair with...
- Shut up about her!

01:26:51.461 --> 01:26:54.798
She's down there.

01:26:55.507 --> 01:26:58.677
Yvonne!

01:27:10.731 --> 01:27:13.692
- Mrs. Lang? Your reaction?
- Justice was done.

01:27:13.859 --> 01:27:16.570
Aren't the good deeds
of your husband...

01:27:16.737 --> 01:27:21.700
- We're happy, that's all.
- Very happy.

01:29:16.482 --> 01:29:20.319
I don't even know where she is.

01:29:21.445 --> 01:29:27.284
Look... You'll be a cop again.
It's what you love.

01:29:27.451 --> 01:29:30.704
I'll be all right.

01:29:30.871 --> 01:29:34.541
I'll be all right.

01:30:15.249 --> 01:30:18.669
Is anyone here?

01:30:18.836 --> 01:30:21.964
Go away.

01:30:23.173 --> 01:30:28.053
- You don't want to be with me.
- What are you talking about?

01:30:31.014 --> 01:30:35.561
- I love you.
- Don't you get it?

01:30:35.769 --> 01:30:43.068
- I've ruined your life.
- I feel like half of me is missing.

01:30:43.235 --> 01:30:49.575
You won $4 million. Do you know
what an amazing gift that is?

01:30:49.741 --> 01:30:53.745
And because of me you have nothing.

01:30:53.912 --> 01:30:57.916
Because of you, I have you.
Why can't you understand?

01:30:59.793 --> 01:31:06.300
If you don't want me, then
I'll walk out that door forever.

01:31:06.508 --> 01:31:12.347
But please stop talking about the
money. It means nothing to me.

01:31:20.063 --> 01:31:23.317
Do you want me to go?

01:31:27.279 --> 01:31:30.449
No.

01:31:33.327 --> 01:31:35.954
Never.

01:31:37.039 --> 01:31:40.876
Never, never.

01:31:44.588 --> 01:31:48.175
You have to excuse me sometimes,
it's just...

01:31:48.342 --> 01:31:53.806
Nobody ever loved me before.

01:32:25.129 --> 01:32:30.008
- I guess he wants some food.
- Shall we invite him in?

01:32:32.010 --> 01:32:34.972
Why not?

01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:59.580
We should leave New York.

01:33:01.039 --> 01:33:05.043
I mean, we're like freaks here.

01:33:06.879 --> 01:33:11.049
I've got a cousin
that lives in Buffalo.

01:33:11.216 --> 01:33:14.344
He keeps asking me to visit.

01:33:14.511 --> 01:33:18.015
Maybe we can stay there for a while.

01:33:18.223 --> 01:33:22.352
I could join the Buffalo force.

01:33:23.812 --> 01:33:28.192
I could be a Buffalo waitress.

01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:48.754
Tonight, I, Angel Dupree,
photographer for the N. Y. Post, -

01:33:48.962 --> 01:33:55.886
- had the chance to study grace and
generosity in dire circumstances.

01:34:00.974 --> 01:34:06.021
In their darkest hour, the stalwart
officer and good-hearted waitress -

01:34:06.188 --> 01:34:09.691
- shared a bowl of soup with me.

01:34:09.858 --> 01:34:14.154
When I left,
the good Samaritan gave me money, -

01:34:14.321 --> 01:34:16.990
- wishing it could be more.

01:34:17.157 --> 01:34:23.997
- "Mail it to Yvonne's Coffee Shop."
- It's a good idea.

01:34:32.256 --> 01:34:35.425
I just want to make one stop.

01:34:40.347 --> 01:34:43.934
- Sweetie...
- I'm okay.

01:34:44.101 --> 01:34:48.147
- I knew this was a bad idea.
- I just wanted to see it again.

01:34:48.313 --> 01:34:51.650
Why is the gate open?

01:34:51.859 --> 01:34:57.197
I don't know.
Well, Carol has a key...

01:34:57.364 --> 01:34:59.741
The door's stuck.

01:35:08.041 --> 01:35:11.962
- What is this?
- It must be a mistake.

01:35:12.171 --> 01:35:16.800
- "The Good Samaritan's Fund".
- "Lotto Lovers".

01:35:16.967 --> 01:35:20.554
"Yvonne's Coffee Shop."

01:35:22.306 --> 01:35:27.102
- It's five dollars.
- Oh, come on!

01:35:27.311 --> 01:35:32.983
"There should be more people
like you. Ethel from Staten Island."

01:35:36.278 --> 01:35:39.781
Here's a cheque for ten.

01:35:43.327 --> 01:35:47.331
This is all for us.
Oh, Charlie!

01:36:22.866 --> 01:36:26.620
"You are an example to all of us.
Betty and Phil. The Bronx."

01:36:27.788 --> 01:36:33.460
"We hope you have a great future.
The Garcias, Long Island City."

01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:50.227
It took them
three days to open all their mail.

01:36:50.394 --> 01:36:56.066
When they were done, New York
had given them a $600, 000 tip.

01:36:58.986 --> 01:37:01.864
Charlie went back to the force.

01:37:07.369 --> 01:37:10.372
Yvonne got her coffee shop back.

01:37:12.666 --> 01:37:16.086
Eddie could only get work
driving a cab.

01:37:17.588 --> 01:37:21.175
And Muriel...
She married Jack Gross, -

01:37:21.383 --> 01:37:25.471
- who took her money
and fled the country.

01:37:25.637 --> 01:37:30.767
Muriel lives in the Bronx now
and works in a nail salon.

01:37:34.104 --> 01:37:37.774
Charlie, Muriel and Yvonne
all lived in a city -

01:37:37.941 --> 01:37:43.614
- where people prayed for miracles.
And sometimes they happened.

01:37:44.305 --> 01:37:50.787
