00:02.181 --> 00:03.764
I need to talk to him
about a kidnap.

00:04.070 --> 00:06.711
It's a tiger kidnap, live,
ongoing, happening now.

00:06.724 --> 00:08.003
Catherine Cawood...

00:08.004 --> 00:10.483
Your grandson - is it him that's
our Tommy's lad?

00:10.484 --> 00:12.603
I'm your dad! You're my son!

00:12.604 --> 00:15.203
I knew your mum!

00:15.204 --> 00:18.043
Nobody "higher up" is gonna know

00:18.044 --> 00:20.443
a single damn thing about
this stupid business!

00:20.444 --> 00:23.283
If he can prove he is his dad,
then he will have rights.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.843
It's all your fault!

00:24.844 --> 00:27.723
You genius, who never gets
his hands mucky!

00:27.724 --> 00:30.043
I'll look in on Tommy Lee Royce's
mother again.

00:30.044 --> 00:32.003
Shan't be long.
OK. What for?

00:32.003 --> 00:35.124
Fun. It was them that killed
that policewoman!

00:41.100 --> 00:43.220
I think I might know
who these people are.

01:05.358 --> 01:07.798
Can you hear me?!

01:07.799 --> 01:09.398
You've got to help me!

01:09.399 --> 01:11.159
He's going to kill me.

01:12.679 --> 01:14.559
He's going to kill me!

01:17.359 --> 01:19.198
I'll gouge his eyes out,

01:19.199 --> 01:21.279
I'll tear his hair out by the
roots...

01:28.959 --> 01:30.918
Shit! Sarge!

01:30.919 --> 01:33.678
Sarge? Do you hear me?

01:33.679 --> 01:37.878
What've you done to her?!
M-Me? I...

01:37.879 --> 01:40.718
It's him! It's him, he's done it,
not me!

01:40.719 --> 01:42.518
Tell me what's happened.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.198
Don't you bloody touch me!
Where've you bloody well been?!

01:45.199 --> 01:47.759
I'm not trying to touch you, I
need to know what's happened.

01:54.079 --> 01:55.838
What the hell's happened?

01:55.839 --> 01:58.278
Sir, girl in the car says
she's been held in a cellar

01:58.279 --> 02:00.958
and assaulted for the last four
days.

02:00.959 --> 02:04.118
Hey, love, you'll be all right
now. What's your name?

02:04.119 --> 02:06.799
Ann... Gallagher.

02:08.439 --> 02:11.078
Who's-Who's done this to my
sergeant, Ann?

02:11.079 --> 02:13.918
I don't know his name,
but he's still in there.

02:13.919 --> 02:16.998
He's in the cellar.

02:16.999 --> 02:19.558
She sprayed him with something.

02:19.559 --> 02:21.278
You and you, round t'back.

02:21.279 --> 02:23.878
Shaf, you're going in the ambulance
with Catherine. If she speaks,

02:23.879 --> 02:26.958
I want to know what she's saying.
Stay with t'lass. Everyone else...

02:26.959 --> 02:29.478
Check the cellar first,
and be careful!

02:29.479 --> 02:32.198
I want the on-call DI,
I want H-MIT, I want CSI.

02:32.199 --> 02:35.119
This is the attempted murder
of a police officer.

02:55.519 --> 02:57.358
There's nobody down here, sir!

02:57.359 --> 02:59.959
She sprayed him!
She gassed him!

03:11.599 --> 03:14.598
Hello?
'Ashley, it's Tommy.'

03:14.599 --> 03:16.838
You all right?
She's escaped.

03:16.839 --> 03:19.518
What?
'She's escaped.'

03:19.519 --> 03:22.078
That bastard policewoman!
They've got her.

03:22.079 --> 03:24.438
You've got to come and pick
me up, you've got to help me.

03:24.439 --> 03:25.758
You're on your own, pal.

03:25.759 --> 03:29.078
Ashley?

03:29.079 --> 03:29.919
Ashley!

03:33.879 --> 03:34.879
Shit!

03:36.479 --> 03:38.278

Don't tell him I already know what's
going on.

04:10.999 --> 04:14.759
Just introduce us as being
from CID. Right.

04:20.119 --> 04:21.158
Kevin.

04:21.159 --> 04:24.358
These fellas are from the CID,
they want to talk to you.

04:24.359 --> 04:26.239
Hi.
How do you do?

04:27.879 --> 04:29.999
Could you give us a few minutes?

04:36.199 --> 04:38.838
Mr Weatherill.
Can I call you Kevin?

04:38.839 --> 04:41.479
Er, yeah. Y-Yeah, of course.

04:54.519 --> 04:57.358
- Hello.
- Lewis?

04:57.359 --> 04:59.158
Yeah, might be.

04:59.159 --> 05:02.558
It's Tommy.
I need a lift. I need picking up.

05:02.559 --> 05:03.999
Have you got a car you can use?

05:06.319 --> 05:08.279
Look, I'll pay you.

05:11.119 --> 05:13.719
Do you know anyone
who's got a car I can borrow?

05:19.359 --> 05:20.918
Where are you?

05:20.919 --> 05:23.638
Where did you drop the
money off, Kevin?

05:23.639 --> 05:25.518
Where did they tell you
to drop the money off?

05:25.519 --> 05:28.559
Er... Er, McDonald's
on the Huddersfield ring road.

05:29.959 --> 05:32.358
And then Birch Services on
the M62.

05:32.359 --> 05:34.599
Whose car did you drive there in?

05:36.199 --> 05:38.359
Mine.
Both times?

05:40.039 --> 05:42.638
Yeah.
You're absolutely certain about that?

05:42.639 --> 05:45.998
You didn't take Nevison's or...
anyone else's?

05:45.999 --> 05:46.999
No.

05:48.039 --> 05:49.078
No, no.

05:49.079 --> 05:50.999
What's your registration number?

05:53.599 --> 05:55.598
Erm...

05:55.599 --> 05:56.839
VE56...

05:58.399 --> 06:00.719
..CHX.

06:03.319 --> 06:05.478
Can you give me, near as you can,
specific times

06:05.479 --> 06:07.998
when those drops were made?
Erm...

06:07.999 --> 06:11.638
The first time, Huddersfield
ring road, that was...

06:11.639 --> 06:13.518
er, Thursday, this last Thursday.

06:13.519 --> 06:15.358
Er, around lunchtime.

06:15.359 --> 06:18.038
Probably... five past, ten past 12?

06:18.039 --> 06:19.558
And the other time?

06:19.559 --> 06:24.438
That was... Er, that was Birch
Services.

06:24.439 --> 06:28.718
Erm, half past ten, quarter to
11, this Monday.

06:28.719 --> 06:30.878
And where did you put it?
The money.

06:30.879 --> 06:33.438
In-in-in-in... In a...

06:33.439 --> 06:36.198
Wasn't, like, in a bin, next to
a... bin.

06:36.199 --> 06:39.318
Was this the Huddersfield
ring road or Birch Services?

06:39.319 --> 06:41.078
Er... Huddersfield.

06:41.079 --> 06:43.359
The second time was in the
men's toilets.

06:44.799 --> 06:49.038
Can you describe to me where the bins
and these toilets are?

06:49.039 --> 06:50.439
Where you left the money?

06:53.679 --> 06:55.678
You can draw a map
or a diagram if it's easier.

06:55.679 --> 06:57.479
Yeah, er...

07:04.039 --> 07:05.239
Phil Crabtree.

07:08.159 --> 07:09.359
Thanks, bye-bye.

07:10.799 --> 07:13.238
Can you just give me a
minute, Kevin?

07:13.239 --> 07:14.679
Has something happened?

07:23.399 --> 07:25.118
We've got her. She's safe.

07:25.119 --> 07:26.958
Huh!

07:26.959 --> 07:28.799
Jesus.

07:30.839 --> 07:33.398
So he knew where she was?

07:33.399 --> 07:35.798
No, I've just had a phone call.
Do you want to ring Helen?

07:35.799 --> 07:37.838
She's asking for her mother.
Where is she?

07:37.839 --> 07:39.998
Local. They're taking her to hospital
in Halifax.

07:39.999 --> 07:41.599
For a checkup. It's routine.

07:43.199 --> 07:44.878
Have they caught the bastards?

07:44.879 --> 07:46.958
That's as much as I know
at the minute.

07:46.959 --> 07:48.078
So-So he didn't know?

07:48.079 --> 07:50.638
We're still having that conversa...
Helen!

07:50.639 --> 07:52.478
Hello, love.
They've found her!

07:52.479 --> 07:54.759
She's safe!

08:01.639 --> 08:02.639
Boss.

08:04.639 --> 08:08.198
There's no ANPR on this fella's
vehicle at either of the two

08:08.199 --> 08:12.119
drop-off points he's mentioned, at
any point over the last four days.

08:15.119 --> 08:18.238
You were telling me which bin
you put the money next to.

08:18.239 --> 08:21.158
Yeah. I, er...
It-It-It's difficult to explain.

08:21.159 --> 08:22.558
Erm...

08:22.559 --> 08:25.118
OK. Well, the thing is, Kevin...

08:25.119 --> 08:26.878
I'm arresting you
on suspicion of abduction

08:26.879 --> 08:28.879
and demanding money with
menaces.

08:30.079 --> 08:32.518
No, that's... Why?!

08:32.519 --> 08:34.878
You're wrong! You've got
the wrong end of the stick!

08:34.879 --> 08:37.638
You do not have to say anything, but
it may harm your defence

08:37.639 --> 08:42.438
if you do not mention when questioned
something you later rely on in court.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.118
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

08:45.119 --> 08:47.238
Do you understand what I'm
saying, Kevin?

08:47.239 --> 08:49.278
Yes, but... I-I...

08:49.279 --> 08:50.759
Is this your mobile phone?

09:01.639 --> 09:03.118
Come on, Mum!

09:03.119 --> 09:05.918
Come on! Mum, come on!

09:05.919 --> 09:07.358
No!

09:07.359 --> 09:09.838
You'll love it.

09:09.839 --> 09:14.198
It's beautiful, it's perfect!

09:14.199 --> 09:16.879
Just let go, Mummy!

09:18.799 --> 09:20.439
Mummy!

09:21.639 --> 09:24.358
She's become
extremely tachycardic.

09:24.359 --> 09:25.839
Is everything OK down there?

09:28.759 --> 09:32.238
She is becoming very unstable.
Packs. Quickly.

09:32.239 --> 09:35.039
Her abdomen's full of blood,
she's bleeding out.

09:36.639 --> 09:39.039
The spleen's gone. Get the suction.

09:56.079 --> 09:57.678
What do we know?

09:57.679 --> 09:59.758
No more than I told you on the
phone.

09:59.759 --> 10:02.318
She's still in theatre.
I don't know where she is.

10:02.319 --> 10:06.038
They showed me in here. They said it
could be hours. Why?

10:06.039 --> 10:08.958
They're having to remove her spleen.
Why?!

10:08.959 --> 10:11.438
Well, she... Somebody beat her up.

10:11.439 --> 10:12.758
Who? I don't know.

10:12.759 --> 10:15.838
Well, what... What does that mean,
your spleen? What does that do?

10:15.839 --> 10:18.518
I don't... I have no...
You know as much as I do.

10:18.519 --> 10:20.278
What was she doing?

10:20.279 --> 10:22.598
Just what I've said. That's all I
know.

10:22.599 --> 10:25.239
Is there someone to talk to?
They keep popping in.

10:26.519 --> 10:27.998
Are you all right?

10:27.999 --> 10:31.958
Yeah. I just...

10:31.959 --> 10:33.959
I don't know what to do with meself.

10:41.519 --> 10:44.039
Are you not in t'salon today?

10:45.559 --> 10:48.039
Yeah, I'm down there now.
This is a hologram.

10:51.679 --> 10:52.559
What's up?

10:56.879 --> 10:57.999
I might...

10:58.959 --> 11:00.599
I might pop out for a bit.

11:09.039 --> 11:11.078
You've been at it again.

11:11.079 --> 11:13.999
After everything that's been said.

11:20.239 --> 11:23.518
Ashley Cowgill? I'm Detective
Constable Christine Whittaker.

11:23.519 --> 11:24.998
Can I come in?

11:24.999 --> 11:27.559
What's it to do with?
You all right if I come in?

11:30.719 --> 11:32.038
Is this your wife?

11:32.039 --> 11:34.278
Yeah, she's...
What's the matter?

11:34.279 --> 11:35.438
What's going on?

11:35.439 --> 11:38.998
OK, Ashley, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of abduction

11:38.999 --> 11:40.478

11:40.479 --> 11:41.958
What?!

11:41.959 --> 11:44.438

it may harm your defence

11:44.439 --> 11:47.438
if you do not mention when questioned
something you later rely on in court.

11:47.439 --> 11:48.678
That's...

11:48.679 --> 11:52.038
You can't, th... Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

11:52.039 --> 11:54.679
Are you with me, Ashley?
Have you taken that in?

11:56.319 --> 11:57.279
I haven't...

11:58.919 --> 12:00.398
I didn't... This isn't me.

12:00.399 --> 12:03.599
Why would he do something
like that? We've got caravans!

12:05.279 --> 12:08.759
We've got a games room that caters
for people in wheelchairs!

12:37.279 --> 12:39.078
Ryan, your grandad's here.

12:39.079 --> 12:41.918
Hiya, Ryan.
And your stepgran, Ros.

12:41.919 --> 12:43.438

12:43.439 --> 12:46.078

home with them today

12:46.079 --> 12:48.238

had to go into hospital.

12:48.239 --> 12:51.318
And your Auntie Clare's with
her, so...

12:51.319 --> 12:52.359
OK.

12:53.519 --> 12:56.078
Do you want to have another go at
football in our back garden?

12:56.079 --> 12:57.958
See if you can teach me
a few new moves?

12:57.959 --> 12:59.239
Why's she in hospital?

13:00.759 --> 13:03.118
She's had a bit of an
accident at work. Yeah.

13:03.119 --> 13:05.398
Is she all right?

13:05.399 --> 13:08.319
She's going to be absolutely
fine, love.

14:32.559 --> 14:35.518
'and the abduction of Ann Gallagher.'
They're gonna do house-to-house,

14:35.519 --> 14:37.198
door-to-door, then what?

14:37.199 --> 14:39.238
I'll think of summat.

14:39.239 --> 14:43.278
'To Tommy Lee Royce and Lewis
Whippey, I would like to say -

14:43.279 --> 14:47.199
'there is no safe haven,
you will not escape justice.'

14:49.359 --> 14:50.799
Twat.

14:59.879 --> 15:01.958
Could you eat something?

15:01.959 --> 15:06.398
No. I don't know. Should I?

15:06.399 --> 15:08.719
You need to take the Subutex.
Yeah, yeah.

15:10.359 --> 15:11.718
What were they asking you?

15:11.719 --> 15:15.678
I don't want to go through all
that again. Oh, that's fine.

15:15.679 --> 15:17.798
I want to go and see Clare's
sister.

15:17.799 --> 15:20.199
She's going to let us know
when you can visit.

15:26.599 --> 15:27.599
I'll...

15:29.439 --> 15:31.079
I'll go and put the kettle on.

15:34.479 --> 15:36.119
Mm...

15:38.559 --> 15:39.878
Mm...

15:39.879 --> 15:41.839
Catherine?
Mm...

15:44.399 --> 15:45.399
Mm...

15:47.159 --> 15:48.599
Catherine?
Mm...

15:53.119 --> 15:54.518
Hello.

15:54.519 --> 15:56.958
Daniel's here.

15:56.959 --> 16:01.119
And there's a detective outside needs
to talk to you. About what happened.

16:02.759 --> 16:03.759
No shit.

16:05.879 --> 16:07.239
We've been here all day.

16:10.719 --> 16:13.798
All day?

16:13.799 --> 16:14.958
Why, what time is it?

16:14.959 --> 16:16.759
Knocking on for midnight.

16:18.719 --> 16:21.159
You've been asleep,
you've had an anaesthetic.

16:22.319 --> 16:23.678
Why?

16:23.679 --> 16:27.119
The doctors are going to come and
explain everything to you.

16:28.439 --> 16:30.079
Explain everything to me? Why?

16:32.279 --> 16:34.279
Have I died?
No!

16:35.439 --> 16:38.799
You just need to take things steady
for a few days, that's all.

16:41.199 --> 16:43.119
Do you remember what happened?

16:47.519 --> 16:50.438
You got Ann Gallagher out
alive. You saved her life.

16:50.439 --> 16:52.839
Is she all right?
Yeah.

16:54.599 --> 16:57.158
Physically, she's...

16:57.159 --> 17:00.958
And oh, my God, do Helen and Nevison
love you!

17:00.959 --> 17:03.038
I've had a phone call.

17:03.039 --> 17:04.998
He said, "If there's ever anything we
can do..."

17:04.999 --> 17:08.199
I said, "Well, if you fancied
paying off the mortgage!"

17:13.039 --> 17:15.877
They said you were losing
blood. Internally.

17:15.878 --> 17:18.638
That was why they had to take you
into the operating theatre.

17:20.398 --> 17:22.758
You were in there for five
hours. More.

17:22.759 --> 17:24.638
They've all been very kind.

17:26.638 --> 17:27.479
Mum?

17:29.479 --> 17:31.518
How're you feeling?

17:31.519 --> 17:34.478
Hello, love.

17:34.479 --> 17:35.958
How're you feeling?

17:35.959 --> 17:39.198
What do I look like?

17:39.199 --> 17:41.279
You're... bruised.

17:42.759 --> 17:45.798
Mum, there's a detective
from H-MIT outside.

17:45.799 --> 17:48.279
He wants to talk to you
about what happened.

17:49.599 --> 17:50.559
Oh...

17:51.679 --> 17:53.679
Y-You all right?

17:57.159 --> 17:58.359
I got him, though, eh?

18:01.159 --> 18:02.919
I got the bastard.

18:12.639 --> 18:15.958
The big news is we are this close to
proving the people that abducted

18:15.959 --> 18:20.558
Ann Gallagher were the same people
who murdered Kirsten McAskill.

18:20.559 --> 18:22.918
God almighty.

18:22.919 --> 18:24.798
You were right about Milton
Avenue.

18:24.799 --> 18:27.798
We picked Ashley Cowgill up
around lunchtime.

18:27.799 --> 18:30.958
Ann's told us she was held
in a caravan for two nights

18:30.959 --> 18:33.118
after they removed her from
Milton Avenue.

18:33.119 --> 18:35.598
She was in Milton Avenue.

18:35.599 --> 18:37.478
I fast-tracked the swabs you
authorised.

18:37.479 --> 18:42.478
We found DNA from Ann, Tommy Lee
Royce, and the blood...

18:42.479 --> 18:44.398
is from a lad called Lewis
Whippey.

18:44.399 --> 18:46.159
Lewis Whippey.

18:48.479 --> 18:51.718
I collared him for nicking a
motor when he were 15.

18:51.719 --> 18:54.118
Ann Gallagher's identified
them both in the Viper suite

18:54.119 --> 18:56.598
as the men who abducted her.

18:56.599 --> 19:00.238
Back to Cowgill. He's the registered
owner of a white van.

19:00.239 --> 19:05.278
The same make, model and year that'd
been at the scene where Kirsten died.

19:05.279 --> 19:08.638
It was stolen, the van, last week.

19:08.639 --> 19:11.958
Did you report it to the police?
No.

19:11.959 --> 19:14.958
What'd have been t'point?
You'd not do owt about it.

19:14.959 --> 19:17.078
Well, for the insurance, at least.

19:17.079 --> 19:19.758
It wasn't worth owt, wasn't worth
the hassle. It was a shit heap.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.478
He's denying everything, of course.

19:22.479 --> 19:25.078
Doesn't know Tommy or
Lewis from Adam.

19:25.079 --> 19:29.119
But we've got Telecoms analysing his
phone. It's just a matter of time.

19:30.319 --> 19:32.278
And we took the dogs in.

19:32.279 --> 19:36.798
They sniffed out 20 kilos of cannabis
stashed in one of his caravans.

19:36.799 --> 19:39.598
Course, he didn't know
anything about that either.

19:39.599 --> 19:41.199
Wow.

19:42.759 --> 19:43.799
There is some...

19:45.879 --> 19:47.999
..less good news, however,
I'm afraid.

19:51.799 --> 19:55.519
Tommy Lee Royce is still on his toes,
and so is Lewis Whippey.

20:01.239 --> 20:02.439
No...

20:03.719 --> 20:05.678
No...

20:05.679 --> 20:08.718
What-what do you mean? He...

20:08.719 --> 20:11.798
I sprayed him, I blinded him!

20:11.799 --> 20:14.958
He were in the cellar,
he was helpless, he were...

20:14.959 --> 20:17.118
PolSA's pulled that house
apart. Believe me.

20:17.119 --> 20:18.518
They've been in there all day.

20:18.519 --> 20:22.518
He must've managed to slip out before
the first emergency vehicles pulled up.

20:22.519 --> 20:24.398
No.

20:24.399 --> 20:27.279
We will get him, Catherine.
He can't have got far.

20:46.039 --> 20:48.999
I won't become addicted. I refuse.

20:50.239 --> 20:51.879
Good.

20:56.159 --> 20:57.359
I wanted...

20:58.879 --> 21:01.798
..to ask you to do something for me.

21:01.799 --> 21:02.958
What?

21:02.959 --> 21:05.239
I don't want my mum to know.

21:06.519 --> 21:09.078
I want her to die not knowing.

21:09.079 --> 21:10.359
Not knowing...?

21:15.479 --> 21:16.919
He raped you.

21:22.359 --> 21:24.158
I don't want her to know.

21:24.159 --> 21:25.518
Ever.

21:25.519 --> 21:29.758
Ever. Ever. And I can't tell my
dad that.

21:29.759 --> 21:32.558
I tried to, last night,
but I couldn't. I...

21:32.559 --> 21:34.039
I wanted to, but...

21:36.399 --> 21:38.038
..I don't want him picturing...

21:38.039 --> 21:40.799
I don't want to see him picturing...

21:42.359 --> 21:44.718
But he will need to know.
Eventually.

21:44.719 --> 21:45.958
When it goes to court.

21:45.959 --> 21:48.438
And it will go to court,

21:48.439 --> 21:50.559
I will see those people in
court.

21:51.639 --> 21:52.879
My mother...

21:55.119 --> 21:58.198
I think they think it's unlikely
she'll live that long.

21:58.199 --> 22:02.998
And they said it could be eight
months before it gets to court,

22:02.999 --> 22:05.559
and if she never needs to
know, that's... that's...

22:07.239 --> 22:08.679
..that's how I'd like it.

22:10.519 --> 22:13.958
My dad... he will need to know.
Before.

22:13.959 --> 22:16.078
And...

22:16.079 --> 22:17.519
You want me to tell him?

22:19.159 --> 22:20.598
OK.

22:20.599 --> 22:21.998
Really?

22:21.999 --> 22:22.999
Yeah.

22:24.519 --> 22:26.718
When I get out of here.

22:26.719 --> 22:28.719
Can you wait that long?

22:32.679 --> 22:35.558
They took swabs,
the police doctors did,

22:35.559 --> 22:37.918
before they let me see my
mum and dad, so...

22:37.919 --> 22:39.479
they've got everything they
needed.

22:41.279 --> 22:43.079
And they will get him.

22:44.519 --> 22:45.359
Yeah.

22:47.359 --> 22:49.079
I hope so.

23:26.279 --> 23:28.518
Hi, Mike!
Clare. How are you?

23:28.519 --> 23:31.119
Not so bad.
Is Catherine not up?

23:32.359 --> 23:34.358
Yeah, she should be.

23:34.359 --> 23:36.158
I took her up a cup of tea
before I left.

23:36.159 --> 23:39.478
And she's under strict instructions
not to wallow in bed all day.

23:39.479 --> 23:41.119
Come on in.

23:43.999 --> 23:46.359
I won't stop long.
I'll stick t'kettle on.

23:48.479 --> 23:50.279
Oh, you're up!

23:51.919 --> 23:55.199
Catherine! I was knocking on t'door.

23:56.879 --> 23:59.358
You've not started smoking again?

23:59.359 --> 24:01.478
No, it's me.
She just has th'odd one.

24:01.479 --> 24:03.799
How're you feeling?

24:06.639 --> 24:08.439
I'm all right.

24:11.119 --> 24:13.398
I was just popping in to say...

24:13.399 --> 24:14.958
you...

24:14.959 --> 24:19.078
You've probably seen what's on the
front of a couple of the tabloids?

24:19.079 --> 24:20.998
I've spoken to the District
Commander.

24:20.999 --> 24:23.278
He wanted me to assure you
there's no intelligence

24:23.279 --> 24:25.678
whatsoever to suggest that he's got
out of the country.

24:25.679 --> 24:27.718
But if the twisted bastard'd
done it successfully,

24:27.719 --> 24:31.158
there wouldn't be, would there? You think
the press'd know that and we wouldn't?

24:31.159 --> 24:32.718
It wouldn't be t'first time.

24:32.719 --> 24:34.078
We will get him.

24:34.079 --> 24:37.798
Yeah. Do you know how many...

24:37.799 --> 24:40.599
tossers in uniform have said that to
her over t'last three weeks?

24:41.799 --> 24:44.798
Did you make an appointment
with the psychologist?

24:44.799 --> 24:48.478
She told her to put all her
troubles in little envelopes.

24:48.479 --> 24:50.878
And to put the little envelopes
into a little box.

24:50.879 --> 24:54.078
And to put it in the attic till she
felt strong enough to open it up again.

24:54.079 --> 24:55.839
She meant well.

24:57.799 --> 25:00.238
Kevin Weatherill's having
a bad time on remand.

25:00.239 --> 25:03.758
His cell-mate took a shine to him.

25:03.759 --> 25:06.358
You know what it's like inside wi'
some of these Neanderthals.

25:06.359 --> 25:08.078
Every hole's a goal.

25:08.079 --> 25:10.918
He's been hospitalised
with his injuries, apparently.

25:10.919 --> 25:13.478
Jesus.
Sorry.

25:13.479 --> 25:14.918
But the other thing is that

25:14.919 --> 25:17.198
Ashley Cowgill's up for Judge in
Chambers bail this week

25:17.199 --> 25:18.759
and the rumour is he's going
to get it.

25:20.479 --> 25:22.718
How come?

25:22.719 --> 25:23.878
Has he done a deal?

25:23.879 --> 25:25.358
That's...

25:25.359 --> 25:27.798
Yeah. More than likely
what's happened here.

25:27.799 --> 25:29.278
What's that mean?

25:29.279 --> 25:31.718
It means he has information
that could be useful.

25:31.719 --> 25:32.998
To the NCA, I'd imagine.

25:32.999 --> 25:35.519
In return for a reduced
sentence, probably.

25:37.079 --> 25:38.638
And bail.

25:38.639 --> 25:39.838
Does that really happen?

25:39.839 --> 25:44.559
Well, we're speculating. But, yes.
It really happens.

25:45.599 --> 25:47.518
There is some good news.

25:47.519 --> 25:49.518
You wouldn't normally
be told this in advance.

25:49.519 --> 25:52.038
Normally the first you'd hear is
when you got a Royal Warrant

25:52.039 --> 25:54.998
from t'Palace. The District
Commander asked me to let you know -

25:54.999 --> 25:57.518
he thought it might give you
a boost.

25:57.519 --> 26:01.399
He's put your name forward for the
Queen's Police Medal for bravery.

26:02.999 --> 26:04.359
That's big, Catherine.

26:05.879 --> 26:09.958
There's only two other serving officers in
the whole of West Yorkshire who've got it.

26:09.959 --> 26:13.878
You'll have to go and shake hands
and curtsey.

26:13.879 --> 26:15.839
Right.

26:20.959 --> 26:24.838
I think he's holed up, Tommy Lee
Royce, right under our noses.

26:24.839 --> 26:26.878
I think, when we find him,

26:26.879 --> 26:30.638
he'll have been holed up
in t'same spot all along.

26:30.639 --> 26:32.159
It's only a matter of time.

26:35.239 --> 26:37.399
I'll see myself out. Ta-ta.

26:47.159 --> 26:49.199
Will you pick Ryan up at tea time?

26:50.959 --> 26:52.438
He was asking again this
morning,

26:52.439 --> 26:54.878
"When's Granny going to
start picking me up again?"

26:54.879 --> 26:59.278
He just wants... everything
to get back to normal.

26:59.279 --> 27:01.158
Can you drive me up to Heptonstall?

27:01.159 --> 27:02.478
Not again.

27:02.479 --> 27:04.398
Fine. I'll walk.

27:04.399 --> 27:06.158
I'll drive you.
I'll walk.

27:06.159 --> 27:07.919
You can't walk. You can't walk
that far.

27:48.879 --> 27:51.479
It's your birthday next week. Do you
fancy doing something?

27:54.999 --> 27:56.718
No, not really.

27:56.719 --> 27:59.278
We could have a little do.

27:59.279 --> 28:01.079
Just family. A few friends.

28:02.279 --> 28:05.158
Or we could go out. For a meal.

28:05.159 --> 28:07.759
Just a few of us. Somewhere nice.

28:09.919 --> 28:11.199
Hm?

28:18.399 --> 28:21.198
I can't believe
I wasn't at Kirsten's funeral.

28:21.199 --> 28:23.599
Catherine, you were poorly.
You couldn't stand up.

28:26.639 --> 28:28.758
She'd be wondering why I
wasn't there.

28:28.759 --> 28:30.238
Who would?

28:30.239 --> 28:32.239
Kirsten.

28:39.479 --> 28:42.239
I don't think I'd be able
to do it again. On the bus.

28:44.599 --> 28:47.918
I think in future, if I can't get a
lift, I'll just have to stay at home.

28:47.919 --> 28:48.919
OK.

28:50.959 --> 28:53.079
We've had more nonsense
through the letter box.

28:54.479 --> 28:56.558
A dead bird crawling with maggots.

28:56.559 --> 28:58.758
As well as the other filth.

28:58.759 --> 28:59.998
I haven't been back.

28:59.999 --> 29:02.999
My dad went round to pick up
a few more bits and pieces.

29:04.239 --> 29:08.238
So I think I'm just going to stay
there now. At their house.

29:08.239 --> 29:09.839
With the girls. I think that's best.

29:11.279 --> 29:14.038
Could your dad not... drive
you over here?

29:14.039 --> 29:17.038
He won't, Kevin.
He doesn't want me to come.

29:17.039 --> 29:19.318
That's...

29:19.319 --> 29:22.958
You've got to make it clear to him
it wasn't my fault. Any of it.

29:22.959 --> 29:24.638
What do you mean?

29:24.639 --> 29:26.558
Think about it.

29:26.559 --> 29:29.078
If I hadn't seen that
block of cannabis, whatever,

29:29.079 --> 29:31.078
drop out of that sandbag,
then none of it would...

29:31.079 --> 29:33.958
It would never have occurred
to me. Would it? And if... Nevison

29:33.959 --> 29:36.718
had done the decent
thing in the first place.

29:36.719 --> 29:38.838
when I asked him for a rise,
then none of it, again,

29:38.839 --> 29:41.238
none of it would've happened.

29:41.239 --> 29:44.679
I made a mistake. Maybe, I flipped,
God knows, but...

29:47.879 --> 29:50.078
And then you...
Me?

29:50.079 --> 29:51.278
Oh, come on!

29:51.279 --> 29:52.638
You encouraged me.

29:52.639 --> 29:54.078
I...
Maybe not to start with.

29:54.079 --> 29:55.638
But you did. You did!

29:55.639 --> 29:58.198
"Let's split it up into smaller
amounts,

29:58.199 --> 30:01.078
"just a few hundred pounds each,
in different bank accounts."

30:01.079 --> 30:04.518
I was just trying to make some sense
of the mess that you'd made!

30:04.519 --> 30:07.638
Don't you blame me.
Don't you dare blame me!

30:07.639 --> 30:11.639
You've just got to explain to
people that it wasn't entirely...

30:12.879 --> 30:14.998
These things don't happen in
isolation.

30:14.999 --> 30:16.518
That's the point. Surely,

30:16.519 --> 30:18.478
any of us, any one of us,

30:18.479 --> 30:20.998
could find ourselves in a situation
not entirely of our own...

30:20.999 --> 30:22.638
and-and...

30:22.639 --> 30:25.238
I shouldn't have to explain this!

30:25.239 --> 30:26.839
You know what I'm saying!

30:35.359 --> 30:38.518
'It's been almost four weeks,
Superintendant,

30:38.519 --> 30:40.998
'and these men are still out there.

30:40.999 --> 30:44.078
'A number of newspapers ran a
front-page story this morning

30:44.079 --> 30:47.718
'suggesting Tommy Lee Royce had been
seen in Spain.

30:47.719 --> 30:50.998
'What can you say to assure the
people of West Yorkshire, and beyond,

30:50.999 --> 30:54.718
'that these violent criminals
will be brought to justice?

30:54.719 --> 30:58.078
'Well, first I'd like to assure
people that we remain confident

30:58.079 --> 31:01.438
'that they will be caught, and that
it's simply a matter of time.

31:01.439 --> 31:04.998
'What you do have to appreciate with
an inquiry of this nature is

31:04.999 --> 31:07.478
'just how much work
goes on behind the scenes.

31:07.479 --> 31:08.878
'And yet they're still out there.

31:08.879 --> 31:11.639
'And the search goes on,
and it'll continue to go on...'

31:12.639 --> 31:15.078
They're doing this block.
Right now, knocking on doors.

31:15.079 --> 31:16.318
Shit. Shit!

31:16.319 --> 31:18.358
We knew this would happen.
Just calm right down!

31:18.359 --> 31:20.918
They're on the first couple of
floors, the cocky bastards,

31:20.919 --> 31:22.918
and there's a fair good few of 'em.

31:22.919 --> 31:25.838
I-I need a piss!
So, go, then!

31:25.839 --> 31:27.719
It'll take 'em a while to get here.

31:28.959 --> 31:31.958
Won't it?
Probably. I dunno.

31:31.959 --> 31:33.318
Why have you got so much shopping?

31:33.319 --> 31:35.878
Well, cos... Didn't you ask me...?

31:35.879 --> 31:38.638
No. When the idiots are in here
asking stupid little questions.

31:38.639 --> 31:40.719
Why have you got so much shopping?
Oh!

31:42.079 --> 31:46.438
It's for me mum. She can't get out
and about so much...

31:46.439 --> 31:47.799
these days, what with her legs.

31:48.959 --> 31:49.878
Good lad.

31:49.879 --> 31:51.479
Yeah.

31:57.559 --> 31:59.639
You know what to do.

32:46.559 --> 32:49.918
Afternoon. Is it all right if we
step inside for a few minutes?

32:49.919 --> 32:52.198
We're doing
a house-to-house in the area,

32:52.199 --> 32:54.238
and I'd just like to ask you
one or two questions.

32:54.239 --> 32:56.638
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
of course you can. Come in.

32:56.639 --> 32:59.038
Is it all right if my colleague
has a little look round

32:59.039 --> 33:00.398
whilst we're just having a chat?

33:00.399 --> 33:02.479
Yep. No problem.

33:10.559 --> 33:12.278
Who lives in the property?

33:12.279 --> 33:14.558
Besides yourself?
No-one.

33:14.559 --> 33:17.158
How long have you lived here?

33:17.159 --> 33:19.278
Probably... like...18 months?

33:19.279 --> 33:21.838
And the tenancy's
registered in your name?

33:21.839 --> 33:23.038
Yeah.

33:23.039 --> 33:25.398
Do you know
your neighbours? On either side.

33:25.399 --> 33:26.758
Yeah.

33:26.759 --> 33:29.758
Who lives on this side?
Oh, they're weird.

33:29.759 --> 33:32.158
Mucky as well, and it stinks.

33:32.159 --> 33:36.358
I mean, I know I could use a bit of a tidy
up, but at least I can flush my toilet.

33:36.359 --> 33:39.358
Hmm. Have you not been in there,
then?

33:39.359 --> 33:41.838
They're not answering their
door at the minute.

33:41.839 --> 33:45.278
What's the point of an 'ouse to 'ouse
if half of 'em don't answer their doors?

33:45.279 --> 33:47.078
Oh, we just have to keep
coming back till they do.

33:47.079 --> 33:50.278
You'd think they didn't want
to help you, wouldn't you?

33:50.279 --> 33:55.919
No, they're just not all in when we
call, but like I say, we'll be back.

33:58.919 --> 34:03.358
So, who lives there, next
door? How many of them?

34:03.359 --> 34:04.598
Er...

34:04.599 --> 34:07.958
It wouldn't have happened if she
hadn't called me a loser.

34:07.959 --> 34:12.438
Granny? She goes, "You're a
loser, Ryan."

34:12.438 --> 34:16.558
I told Mrs Mukherjee, but she
wouldn't take any notice, so...

34:16.559 --> 34:20.277
So? So you're admitting now that it
was you that ripped up this kid's painting?

34:20.279 --> 34:24.757
It wasn't reet good.
Did you rip up the painting?

34:24.759 --> 34:27.277
I might of.
I might have. Not of.

34:27.279 --> 34:29.638
You couldn't of done any
thing, of isn't a verb.

34:29.639 --> 34:32.598
And don't blame other people
for decisions that you make.

34:32.599 --> 34:34.998
You made the decision
to rip up the painting!

34:34.998 --> 34:39.679
Whatever the hell else happened, whatever
she called you, you made that decision.

34:41.599 --> 34:45.678
When? When? When can I ever pick you
up from that bloody place

34:45.679 --> 34:47.478
without the constant threat
of being hauled in

34:47.478 --> 34:49.838
and made to feel this big
and like a rubbish parent?

34:49.839 --> 34:52.678
Because I am not a rubbish parent!
You are lucky to have me!

34:52.679 --> 34:57.438
And you better start showing me
some respect by behaving properly or...

34:57.439 --> 35:00.278
or there'll be consequences.
And you won't like them.

35:00.279 --> 35:04.719
What consequences?

35:05.919 --> 35:07.399
Granny!

35:14.239 --> 35:15.919
Where is he?
No idea.

35:18.239 --> 35:19.278
What... what's up?

35:19.279 --> 35:21.718
Oh, the usual. Behaving like an
idiot and then lying.

35:21.719 --> 35:24.638
I hate you! Yes, I know, I'm under
no illusions.

35:24.639 --> 35:26.959
You keep telling me.

35:29.199 --> 35:31.638
Bitch! You're an old bitch!
You're an ugly old bitch!

35:31.639 --> 35:34.198
You better do something with
him, cos I'll just kill him.

35:34.199 --> 35:36.758
I think you both need to calm down.
I don't even want to live here!

35:36.759 --> 35:38.398
What's happened?
Good. Move out.

35:38.399 --> 35:40.718
See if anyone else is
daft enough to have you. Please!

35:40.719 --> 35:44.078
Feel free, cos you've ruined me and
your Auntie Clare's life long enough.

35:44.079 --> 35:46.278
I'm ringing Childline.
Yeah, they'll be interested.

35:46.279 --> 35:48.959
I'm reporting you!
Do you want the number?

35:50.359 --> 35:53.038
Cow! Bitch! Wanker!

35:53.039 --> 35:54.999
Wanker. That's new.

35:57.879 --> 35:59.318
Perhaps it was a bit soon for you

35:59.319 --> 36:01.078
to go picking him up.
Looks like it.

36:01.079 --> 36:04.238
You can't talk to him like that.
I've had enough.

36:04.239 --> 36:05.358
I had enough years ago.

36:05.359 --> 36:07.358
It's not normal, is it?
I don't know!

36:07.359 --> 36:10.838
I don't know what's happened!
I've done everything! We both have!

36:10.839 --> 36:12.198
And look at him!
Ssh!

36:12.199 --> 36:14.358
Why did I do it?
Shut up, Catherine!

36:14.359 --> 36:17.158
Richard. My marriage.
Everything. And for what?

36:17.159 --> 36:19.199
A psychopath.
Stop it!

36:21.759 --> 36:25.358
Right, well, there you go.

36:25.359 --> 36:27.879
He's trashing his bedroom,
wrecking our house.

36:29.639 --> 36:31.199
My house.

36:40.719 --> 36:43.438
What are you doing?
I'm trashing my bedroom!

36:43.439 --> 36:45.238
You're not trashing your bedroom!
I hate her!

36:45.239 --> 36:47.519
No, you don't.

36:56.479 --> 37:01.559
I thought... I thought they'd bloody
moved in! I thought they'd never leave!

37:02.799 --> 37:05.358
Why did you sit on me? I thought it'd
look convincing.

37:05.359 --> 37:09.078
You knob! I couldn't breathe! You've
dislocated me shoulder!

37:09.079 --> 37:11.598
I'm friggin' freezing!
I've gotta get Tommy out.

37:11.599 --> 37:13.118
Leave him!
Eh?

37:13.119 --> 37:15.638
Leave him a bit longer.
Don't be stupid.

37:15.639 --> 37:18.558
Brett, Brett, Brett! Listen to
me! Listen!

37:18.559 --> 37:21.958
I did not kill that police woman. And
I did not rape Ann Gallagher.

37:21.959 --> 37:25.278
I did not beat up that other one! I
am not going down for those things!

37:25.279 --> 37:27.958
Let's go, let's get the police
now, let's tell 'em.

37:27.959 --> 37:31.158
Grass him up?
It's not about grassing him up!

37:31.159 --> 37:33.078
It's about me and you getting
in deep shit,

37:33.079 --> 37:35.278
because we're hiding him
and we don't need to be!

37:35.279 --> 37:36.958
He's a nutter!
Not happening.

37:36.959 --> 37:39.039
You're not even his friend.
You're my friend.

37:40.239 --> 37:42.598
Not happening.

37:42.599 --> 37:44.919
Why? Why?

37:52.079 --> 37:53.479
They've gone, big fella.

38:11.399 --> 38:12.838
She does love you.

38:12.839 --> 38:16.758
She loves you more than you could
ever begin to imagine.

38:16.759 --> 38:19.718
What you've got to try
and get your head round -

38:19.719 --> 38:23.478
and you're only eight, and it's
difficult, and that's fine.

38:23.479 --> 38:27.238
What you've got to
understand is that Granny's...

38:27.239 --> 38:31.278
She's still poorly,
and she's going to get better,

38:31.279 --> 38:33.279
she's going to be absolutely
fine.

38:34.999 --> 38:39.478
But sometimes, you can be poorly in
your head as well as in your body.

38:39.479 --> 38:42.558
Do you mean like... mental?

38:42.559 --> 38:44.759
No, Ryan. She's not mental.

38:46.759 --> 38:49.038
She's depressed.

38:49.039 --> 38:52.638
And that sometimes means that someone
isn't quite their self,

38:52.639 --> 38:57.918
and I think we just have to be kind
to her, like she's kind to you, normally,

38:57.919 --> 39:00.678
when you're angry and upset.

39:00.679 --> 39:03.998
And that's what's going
to help her get better.

39:03.999 --> 39:07.998
Am I adopted?
Well, no... Not...

39:07.999 --> 39:11.678
I mean, she's your real granny
and I'm your real auntie. What do you mean?

39:11.679 --> 39:13.759
Who was that man
who said he was my dad?

39:16.119 --> 39:17.399
No-one.

39:18.519 --> 39:19.519
No-one.

39:20.839 --> 39:23.599
He's not your dad. Your dad's dead.

39:29.599 --> 39:31.759
What about tidying this room?
Hm?

39:40.159 --> 39:42.559
Do you want some tea?

39:44.559 --> 39:45.919
I've broken the kettle.

39:51.519 --> 39:53.678
Well, I can boil some water in
a pan.

39:53.679 --> 39:56.838
And then, tomorrow, you can go out
and buy us a new one.

39:56.839 --> 39:59.039
It'll give you something to do.

40:00.439 --> 40:01.559
Is he all right?

40:04.319 --> 40:06.479
Are you?

40:35.279 --> 40:38.438
Open it.
Is the incorrect response.

40:38.439 --> 40:41.039
I'm not in the mood, Julie!
Join the club, pal.

40:43.119 --> 40:46.919
All right. Thanks for picking
me up. I'm sorry I've...

40:49.439 --> 40:51.438
I'm sorry.

40:51.439 --> 40:53.158
I am sorry.

40:53.159 --> 40:55.559
I'm sorry for everything.

40:59.759 --> 41:01.199
How are the boys?

41:10.119 --> 41:11.718
You smell like a lag.

41:11.719 --> 41:14.359
Let's go home.
Have you done a deal?

41:16.599 --> 41:18.078
Can we just get home?

41:18.079 --> 41:22.519
I want to know... if you've sold us
down the river.

41:24.679 --> 41:26.879
I'll explain it all to you
when we get home.

41:47.959 --> 41:51.399
Thank you for helping Clare with
Ryan when I was in hospital.

41:55.399 --> 41:57.878
He's all right.

41:57.879 --> 41:59.998
I can't stand him.

41:59.999 --> 42:02.078
Sorry?
I can't stand him.

42:02.079 --> 42:05.918
What are you talking about? Ryan. I
can't stand looking at him.

42:05.919 --> 42:09.558
Why are you saying that? No, I
understand it. I get what it was.

42:09.559 --> 42:11.998
I get why you couldn't live in the
same house. I get it. I get it.

42:11.999 --> 42:14.718
Believe me, I get it. You can't...
You can't say that.

42:14.719 --> 42:15.758
Can't I? Why?

42:15.759 --> 42:18.278
Because you made the choice.
Why didn't I listen to you?

42:18.279 --> 42:21.238
You can't say that, Catherine.
Do you want him? No!

42:21.239 --> 42:26.358
I mean, I would, but you...
you don't mean this.

42:26.359 --> 42:28.558
The times I've had to sit and
listen

42:28.559 --> 42:33.278
to the stupid, mindless, idiotic
things he's done at that school.

42:33.279 --> 42:36.158
Daniel was never like that!
Becky was never like that!

42:36.159 --> 42:37.598
Where's it come from? Hm?

42:37.599 --> 42:40.158
It's not rocket science, is it?
Yeah.

42:40.159 --> 42:42.878
And it's still not his fault
either, is it?

42:42.879 --> 42:45.398
I thought you said he was dyslexic?
He's daft.

42:45.399 --> 42:48.158
Catherine, if he's dyslexic, he will
get angry and frustrated.

42:48.159 --> 42:51.358
It doesn't mean he's... like his
dad.

42:51.359 --> 42:52.758
Yeah, but...

42:52.759 --> 42:54.838
What? But what?
He's bound to be at some level.

42:54.839 --> 42:56.519
He's just bound to be, in't he?

42:59.479 --> 43:01.638
Tommy Lee Royce, right?

43:01.639 --> 43:06.038
I don't even think he's a
psychopath, not a real one.

43:06.039 --> 43:11.158
I think he is this little twisted
thing who grew up unloved.

43:11.159 --> 43:13.198
More than unloved, despised
probably,

43:13.199 --> 43:16.878
treated like dirt on a daily
basis in squalor and chaos.

43:16.879 --> 43:19.478
Ryan is loved.

43:19.479 --> 43:24.438
Cared for. He has not grown up in
either squalor or chaos, thanks to you.

43:24.439 --> 43:26.638
There's a massive, massive
difference!

43:26.639 --> 43:31.438
And yeah, part of him will always
inevitably be Tommy Lee bloody Royce,

43:31.439 --> 43:33.518
but part of him will always be
Becky.

43:33.519 --> 43:36.838
And a bigger part of him will
be you. And Clare.

43:36.839 --> 43:40.278
Because you're the people who've had
most influence on him!

43:40.279 --> 43:42.558
And I understand it's tough
from time to time,

43:42.559 --> 43:44.958
but kids are a nightmare.

43:44.959 --> 43:47.798
All kids, any kid,
they all have their moments.

43:47.799 --> 43:51.038
You know this.
Blimey! Becky, she used to

43:51.039 --> 43:52.919
drive us up the flaming...
Don't!

43:56.119 --> 43:59.039
It's kind of interesting
to hear you defending him.

44:04.399 --> 44:06.119
Daniel rang me last night.

44:08.759 --> 44:12.678
Clare had rung him. She was
worried. About you.

44:12.679 --> 44:15.879
That's... that's why I asked you
out.

44:18.839 --> 44:20.878
What are you doing
for your birthday next week?

44:20.879 --> 44:22.358
Same as I do every year.
Nothing.

44:22.359 --> 44:23.718
That's not true.

44:23.719 --> 44:26.798
We used to do... We...
Why am I even here?

44:26.799 --> 44:28.198
Sorry?

44:28.199 --> 44:31.718
For the last eight years, I have not
celebrated my birthday.

44:31.719 --> 44:34.959
Course, you wouldn't know that,
because you divorced me.

44:36.079 --> 44:39.438
Ever since Becky died,
do you know how...?

44:39.439 --> 44:42.198
You must, she was your daughter too,
maybe it's different for men.

44:42.199 --> 44:44.358
I've got no idea. But do you
know how perverse it is

44:44.359 --> 44:47.398
that people think you want to
celebrate your own existence

44:47.399 --> 44:49.958
when you've got a child who's
dead?

44:49.959 --> 44:52.878
No offence, but I carried her
for nine months in here.

44:52.879 --> 44:54.918
Her flesh was my flesh, and
she's dead.

44:54.919 --> 44:56.878
Part of me is dead.

44:56.879 --> 44:58.998
Physically dead.

44:58.999 --> 45:01.958
I thought I'd come to terms with it,
and I haven't, I never will,

45:01.959 --> 45:05.518
and why the hell Clare's got this
obsession with celebrating my birthday,

45:05.519 --> 45:08.478
I do not know.
Catherine, it's not an obsession.

45:08.479 --> 45:11.239
She's just trying to focus on it
to... Cheer me up!

45:13.279 --> 45:16.679
People are trying to help you,
because they love you.

45:17.999 --> 45:20.879
And at the moment, it feels
like they're hitting a brick wall.

45:27.039 --> 45:29.198
There you go.

45:29.199 --> 45:30.839
Thanks.
Thanks.

45:34.079 --> 45:37.599
I have to go.
We've just... got food.

45:40.199 --> 45:41.798
I don't want you to ring me up
any more.

45:41.799 --> 45:45.638
We should never have got back into
bed together, it was stupid.

45:45.639 --> 45:48.198
You don't have to do that.
Catherine...

45:48.199 --> 45:49.759
Catherine!

46:16.479 --> 46:18.878
Hello?

46:18.879 --> 46:22.198
Catherine? It's Phil. Crabtree.

46:22.199 --> 46:23.679
Oh, er, hello.

46:24.959 --> 46:26.358
How are you?

46:26.359 --> 46:28.078
Fine. I'm fine.

46:28.079 --> 46:31.358
I wondered if you wanted to be brought
up to speed with where we're at.

46:31.359 --> 46:33.638
I think you might find it
interesting.

46:33.639 --> 46:36.479
Ashley Cowgill was let out on bail
this morning.

46:37.759 --> 46:38.759
What's the story?

46:41.039 --> 46:43.438
Can I trust you?

46:43.439 --> 46:45.239
I don't know. What do you think?

46:47.119 --> 46:49.238
While he was on remand,
he indicated

46:49.239 --> 46:51.878
he had information that would make
the National Crime Agency

46:51.879 --> 46:54.238
wet themselves with excitement.
Well, yeah...

46:54.239 --> 46:56.519
I assumed it'd be something
of that sort.

46:57.679 --> 47:01.958
Cowgill, many moons ago, worked on
the importation side.

47:01.959 --> 47:05.438
Have you heard of Gathercoles?
Pharmaceuticals?

47:05.439 --> 47:09.038
They've got factories in the North East
and Scotland. Completely legitimate.

47:09.039 --> 47:11.118
OK.

47:11.119 --> 47:14.238
They import all sorts of refined
chemicals from all over,

47:14.239 --> 47:17.478
and one thing they do import
is paracetamol.

47:17.479 --> 47:19.918
From a Spanish company
based in Almeria.

47:19.919 --> 47:22.518
The hauliers bring the product
up through Spain,

47:22.519 --> 47:24.918
up through France, into Holland
in trucks.

47:24.919 --> 47:29.878
The trucks go from Rotterdam to Hull,
then onto the North East and Scotland.

47:29.879 --> 47:31.998
Eight or nine of them,
every week,

47:31.999 --> 47:35.798
carrying up to 500 kilos
of paracetamol in each.

47:35.799 --> 47:37.358
Yeah?

47:37.359 --> 47:39.878
But before they leave Rotterdam,

47:39.879 --> 47:43.198
every other lorry visits
another factory in Dordrecht.

47:43.199 --> 47:45.038
On a daily basis,

47:45.039 --> 47:48.638
a number of lorries pull in at this
place and the driver is paid

47:48.639 --> 47:52.958
£25 a kilo to wander
over there and have a fag.

47:52.959 --> 47:56.798
One drum in every load
is taken out, partially emptied,

47:56.799 --> 47:59.798
refilled with exactly
the same weight in cocaine

47:59.799 --> 48:02.038
and shipped to England.

48:02.039 --> 48:04.598
In England, the reverse happens.

48:04.599 --> 48:06.838
As soon as the lorry's
away from the docks,

48:06.839 --> 48:10.118
the cocaine's taken out and the
paracetamol's put back in.

48:10.119 --> 48:16.278
That's 25 kilos of cocaine
coming into the UK

48:16.279 --> 48:18.358
up to four times a week.

48:18.359 --> 48:21.678
And how do you know all this isn't
Tales of the Arabian Nights?

48:21.679 --> 48:24.038
We're confident he hasn't made
the whole thing up.

48:24.039 --> 48:27.278
So, if it is true, that's...
Catherine. It's huge.

48:27.279 --> 48:30.278
You've facilitated a link
to a team of drug dealers

48:30.279 --> 48:34.358
with a distribution network
in the UK worth millions.

48:34.359 --> 48:38.758
Ultimately, some serious players are
going to have their assets frozen.

48:38.759 --> 48:41.638
And they're going to want to know
who's opened their mouth.

48:41.639 --> 48:45.518
Ashley Cowgill may have bought
himself a reduced sentence,

48:45.519 --> 48:49.078
but him and his family'll be on the
witness protection programme for ever.

48:49.079 --> 48:52.839
He'll be looking over his shoulder
for the rest of his life.

48:56.199 --> 48:58.278
I don't believe what you're
telling me.

48:58.279 --> 48:59.279
We'll be fine.

49:00.799 --> 49:02.279
What about the salon?

49:03.399 --> 49:04.919
There'll be other salons.

49:06.079 --> 49:08.118
What about me mum and dad?

49:08.119 --> 49:10.318
My family.

49:10.319 --> 49:11.599
Everything!

49:15.679 --> 49:18.119
God, you really have
sold us down the river!

49:28.999 --> 49:30.559
I'm sorry I've been an arse.

49:32.279 --> 49:33.479
You're not an arse.

49:34.519 --> 49:36.558
Where have you been?
Richard rang.

49:36.559 --> 49:41.678
Oh. Oh, that was a mistake, I should
never have got back into all that.

49:41.679 --> 49:43.518
You all right? Yep.

49:43.519 --> 49:45.558
Sure?

49:45.559 --> 49:47.998
Yeah, I were thinking, um...

49:47.999 --> 49:50.958
maybe I should... maybe we should...

49:50.959 --> 49:52.599
for my birthday... do...

49:55.239 --> 49:56.599
Nothing big, but...

49:58.199 --> 49:59.518
OK.

49:59.519 --> 50:02.558
OK, yeah. What about Helen
and Nevison and Ann?

50:02.559 --> 50:05.478
Yeah. If... Yeah.

50:05.479 --> 50:08.998
When you going to tell
Nevison about Ann?

50:08.999 --> 50:13.039
Well, when... when I... I'll do it
tomorrow. Where's Ryan?

50:39.199 --> 50:40.759
What's this?

50:42.039 --> 50:43.358
Zombies.

50:43.359 --> 50:44.839
Oh, nice.

51:12.799 --> 51:13.879
Are you warm enough?

51:15.279 --> 51:18.438
You see? This is why I spend half my
time round at our Marie's.

51:18.439 --> 51:20.158
It's just to keep warm.

51:20.159 --> 51:22.278
Although...

51:22.279 --> 51:26.198
with all this, er, this cash
you've got...

51:26.199 --> 51:27.958
Tommy?

51:27.959 --> 51:31.479
If you wanted me to get it switched
on again, the heating...

51:39.799 --> 51:42.238
What's happened?
Where've you been?

51:42.239 --> 51:45.558
What's happened?
He come at me with a knife!

51:45.559 --> 51:47.998
When?
Last night.

51:47.999 --> 51:49.559
Shit! Shit!

51:50.719 --> 51:51.998
The ungrateful bastard!

51:51.999 --> 51:55.318
They'd have caught him by now. They'd
have had him if it hadn't been for me!

51:55.319 --> 51:57.238
Shit!
I need some pills.

51:57.239 --> 51:59.159
What pills?
Painkiller pills!

52:02.239 --> 52:05.638
Tommy! You're going to die, man!
You need to got to hospital!

52:05.639 --> 52:07.638
Shit!
What am I going to do?

52:07.639 --> 52:08.918
I need some...

52:08.919 --> 52:11.399
bandages or...
No. OK, but...

52:13.119 --> 52:16.038
That's not bandages, that's...
You're going to...

52:16.039 --> 52:19.438
I think, Tommy, it's the end
of the road, mate.

52:19.439 --> 52:22.798
Buddy, you gotta hand yourself in!
We could've got away with this.

52:22.799 --> 52:26.758
All we had to do was bide our
time. The dopey twats were clueless.

52:26.759 --> 52:29.678
You've done really well,
Tommy. I can't believe it!

52:29.679 --> 52:31.919
Just cos of that dozy feckless
piece of shite!

52:33.799 --> 52:36.078
What a way to go, eh?

52:36.079 --> 52:38.918
No, you'll be fine. You're not going
nowhere, Tommy.

52:38.919 --> 52:41.038
I'm not going to an hospital,
I'm not...

52:41.039 --> 52:42.358
I'm not handing myself in.

52:42.359 --> 52:44.518
But you...
It... it... it's over.

52:44.519 --> 52:47.759
It's over, I know, but... no way
am I handing myself in.

52:51.039 --> 52:53.879
Do you want a beer?
Er...

53:11.239 --> 53:14.478
I could've been someone, me.
I could've done stuff.

53:14.479 --> 53:17.358
You still can, Tommy.
Ashley Cowgill.

53:17.359 --> 53:19.879
He's nothing compared
to what I could've done.

53:21.119 --> 53:26.558
I had ideas, I had plans.
I could've rocked the world.

53:26.559 --> 53:29.478
Why don't you just let me go and ring
for an ambulance?

53:29.479 --> 53:33.678
No, no, no. I just want you to go
and get me some pain killers. That's all.

53:33.679 --> 53:35.518
Why?

53:35.519 --> 53:37.879
I've got a... kid.

53:39.759 --> 53:42.639
Did you know that? A boy.

53:44.519 --> 53:47.358
He don't know me. He...

53:47.359 --> 53:49.798
He lives in Hebden Bridge.

53:49.799 --> 53:51.919
With that bitch that gassed me.

53:53.439 --> 53:56.558
She's his granny. How mad is that?

53:56.559 --> 54:00.079
What...? What kind of life is that
for a lad, eh?

54:01.919 --> 54:04.679
Living with an old woman
and no dad.

54:06.399 --> 54:07.879
It... it's not...

54:10.239 --> 54:11.759
It's not... Shit!

54:13.959 --> 54:15.639
Oh, shit!

54:17.439 --> 54:20.599
It's no life, not for a lad.

54:29.959 --> 54:33.838
What do you want me to do
about him? Who?

54:33.839 --> 54:38.518
Him! Do you want me to give him a
good kicking before he wakes up?

54:38.519 --> 54:42.679
No. You... you don't need
to give him a good kicking.

54:45.399 --> 54:46.838
He isn't...?

54:46.839 --> 54:49.239
You didn't really think he was
asleep?

55:03.759 --> 55:05.518
You...

55:05.519 --> 55:06.639
Oh, you've slit his...

55:09.599 --> 55:10.759
Oh, Jesus!

55:38.079 --> 55:39.318
Hey...

55:39.319 --> 55:42.558
You're not going to go weird on
me, Brett, are you?

55:42.559 --> 55:44.478
Oh, oh...

55:44.479 --> 55:49.559
Come on, you're not... You're not
chicken shit like him. Are you?

55:52.599 --> 55:55.078
Hey, shut your mouth!

55:55.079 --> 55:56.678
Shut your mouth!

55:56.679 --> 55:59.119
Ssh! Shut...

57:28.919 --> 57:32.119
Come on, don't want you
to be late for school.

57:35.679 --> 57:37.838
Sorry I've not been much fun lately.

57:37.839 --> 57:40.038
It's all right.

57:40.039 --> 57:41.079
Morning.

57:42.399 --> 57:43.599
Morning.

57:44.919 --> 57:47.319
I miss your mum sometimes,
that's all.

57:48.759 --> 57:49.959
Why are you crying?

57:51.001 --> 57:53.800
It just happens when you get
to my age.

57:53.801 --> 57:55.041
It'll be reet.
