your husband and son.

00:06.220 --> 00:08.690
But now Frankie's dead

And now it's all going to come out.

00:10.460 --> 00:12.530
Mate, your girlfriend is so fit.

00:12.580 --> 00:15.610
- Clarissa, where did you find this?
- In Frankie's mobile cache.

00:15.660 --> 00:17.930
I'm not surprised they were
worried. That was rape.

00:17.980 --> 00:19.890
'I need to speak to Becky
and she's blocked me.

00:19.940 --> 00:21.050
'It's about her dad.'

00:21.100 --> 00:23.410
- You're going to call her.
- And what if I don't?

00:23.460 --> 00:25.410
- Is Paul your boyfriend?
- No.

00:25.460 --> 00:28.690
- We live together, but not like that.
- We think Frankie may have been

00:28.740 --> 00:31.050
killed because of
something him and Liam did.

00:31.100 --> 00:34.100
I know where Liam is. I'm on my way.

Cheer, guys. Drink up, please!

You all right, mate? Come on.

- It's all right.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.740
- Sorry.
- All right.

02:14.380 --> 02:15.890
Liam opens the door,

02:15.940 --> 02:19.140
but keeps the chain on,
because he's suspicious.

02:20.180 --> 02:22.090
He was right to be.

02:22.140 --> 02:24.880
Gunman shoots him through the crack...

02:25.580 --> 02:27.690
.. hits him in the shoulder.

02:27.740 --> 02:33.780
He kicks the door in... but Liam,
he's still mobile, stumbles away.

02:35.460 --> 02:37.930
Now, someone, presumably Liam...

02:38.740 --> 02:41.850
.. smashes the bottle of
beer -- mind the glass --

02:41.900 --> 02:45.170
he crawls toward the back door.

02:45.220 --> 02:47.690
Bullet wound to the right shoulder,

02:47.740 --> 02:50.010
another bullet caught him
in the back of the knee.

02:50.060 --> 02:53.780
And one to the back of the skull.

02:58.980 --> 03:02.980
Looks like our gunman caught
his clothing as he climbed over.

03:04.660 --> 03:06.130
What is it?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.620
Not just fibres. He cut himself.

03:45.020 --> 03:47.930
Both boys in the video are dead, guv.

03:47.980 --> 03:50.410
And we know that they were
scared about retribution.

03:50.460 --> 03:52.410
I've just checked with the nursing staff.

03:52.460 --> 03:55.500
Stuart Teller arrived back at
the hospital in the last hour.

03:56.980 --> 03:58.730
Becky's his only child.

03:58.780 --> 04:02.280
If he'd somehow found out
what those boys had done...

04:07.420 --> 04:08.890
Mr Teller?

04:10.580 --> 04:12.050
Mr Teller.

04:16.339 --> 04:20.060
DI Tanner. We met briefly
yesterday at Becky's flat.

04:23.620 --> 04:25.770
Is this about my daughter's boss?

04:25.820 --> 04:29.300
Just a quick word down the
station, if you don't mind.

05:07.860 --> 05:10.730
We're taking your dad in for questioning.

05:12.300 --> 05:16.100
- Why? - He assaulted
your boss, Jason Bradwell.

05:19.140 --> 05:20.450
I didn't know.

05:20.500 --> 05:24.170
They say you can go home today.
Will there be someone there?

05:24.220 --> 05:26.290
Erm... Paul.

05:26.340 --> 05:27.370
Why?

05:27.420 --> 05:29.570
Becky, I need to ask you some questions

05:29.620 --> 05:31.960
that you might find difficult.

05:32.940 --> 05:34.540
Embarrassing.

05:35.300 --> 05:38.570
You know we were investigating
the murder of your ex-boyfriend,

05:38.620 --> 05:40.360
Frankie McAteer.

05:41.820 --> 05:43.130
I'm afraid that his friend,

05:43.180 --> 05:46.220
Liam Stanwell, was also
murdered last night.

05:51.340 --> 05:54.140
I'm sorry to have to tell you like this.

05:55.580 --> 05:57.650
Did you know Liam well?

05:58.860 --> 06:01.330
We went out... a couple of times.

06:02.780 --> 06:04.920
Never really talked much.

06:06.340 --> 06:08.410
Becky, I have to ask...

06:09.700 --> 06:14.540
.. did you ever have sexual
relations with Liam Stanwell?

06:22.380 --> 06:24.380
I know this is hard...

06:26.220 --> 06:28.760
.. but we need to talk about this.

06:35.540 --> 06:37.290
That...

06:37.340 --> 06:40.080
That doctor you brought to the house...

06:41.940 --> 06:44.090
.. I'll talk to her.

06:44.140 --> 06:46.610
I found out that Bradwell
had fired my daughter.

06:46.660 --> 06:48.410
I went round there to reason with him.

06:48.460 --> 06:50.650
You broke his nose. Knocked
two of his teeth out.

06:50.700 --> 06:53.300
Doesn't seem that reasonable to me.

06:53.540 --> 06:56.570
Don't get me wrong, I can
understand the anger.

06:56.620 --> 06:58.730
Got a couple of girls myself.

06:58.780 --> 07:01.770
Some of the fellas they've
brought home? Christ on a bike.

07:01.820 --> 07:06.090
Bushy beards, half-mast jeans.
I've imagined doing what you did.

07:06.140 --> 07:08.930
Taking my fist and planting it
full-square in their stupid,

07:08.980 --> 07:10.250
grinning faces.

07:10.300 --> 07:14.090
But that's the difference
between me and you, right there.

07:14.140 --> 07:16.810
I fantasise about extreme violence...

07:17.700 --> 07:19.700
.. you actually do it.

07:21.020 --> 07:25.420
If you can do that to some little
ponce who sacked your daughter...

07:26.220 --> 07:28.370
.. I wonder what you'd do to
someone who really hurt her.

07:28.420 --> 07:30.130
Why don't you just say what you mean?

07:30.180 --> 07:32.810
I think you know what I mean.
Becky was filmed having sex.

07:32.860 --> 07:35.940
One of the boys involved put
the footage on the internet.

07:37.020 --> 07:38.250
You didn't know about this?

07:38.300 --> 07:43.220
I said "boys", plural, and
you didn't even question that?

07:45.620 --> 07:48.250
The footage depicts your
daughter having sex with

07:48.300 --> 07:50.690
the two young men who are now dead.

07:50.740 --> 07:55.460
We don't know if it was
consensual or if it was assault.

07:58.340 --> 08:01.540
I can only imagine how
terrible that must feel...

08:03.020 --> 08:06.620
.. knowing that your daughter's
been treated that way.

08:06.780 --> 08:08.450
If it was me...

08:10.580 --> 08:13.250
.. I'd want to do something about it.

08:15.780 --> 08:18.120
And if I'd known about that...

08:18.580 --> 08:21.380
.. you bet your life, I would have done.

08:23.220 --> 08:27.370
Becky, some footage was
found on Frankie's phone.

08:27.420 --> 08:31.940
He'd deleted it, but my
colleagues managed to retrieve it.

08:33.100 --> 08:34.770
You've seen it?

08:36.940 --> 08:38.940
I think you should go.

08:39.380 --> 08:42.330
I only agreed to see you because
I thought you hadn't seen it.

08:42.380 --> 08:45.580
- Just go. - Of course.
If that's what you want.

08:47.060 --> 08:50.010
But I think that maybe
you agreed to see me

08:50.060 --> 08:53.060
because you know you
need to talk about it.

08:53.460 --> 08:56.200
And I'm a doctor, not a police officer.

08:56.700 --> 08:59.300
It's a lot for you to carry around.

09:03.780 --> 09:06.380
I don't actually remember that much.

09:08.100 --> 09:11.460
I know... I had sex.

09:13.980 --> 09:16.250
I had sex with both of them.

09:17.020 --> 09:20.580
- Oh, Christ. - Saying you had
sex suggests it was consensual.

09:22.100 --> 09:25.340
To give consent, you need the
freedom and the capacity to choose.

09:26.620 --> 09:29.360
I don't think you got to choose, Becky.

09:30.260 --> 09:32.900
Whatever happened wasn't your fault.

09:39.420 --> 09:41.160
Look, I'm sorry.

09:42.940 --> 09:44.940
This isn't me.

09:46.700 --> 09:49.040
Before all this happened, I...

09:50.740 --> 09:52.050
.. I was strong,

09:52.100 --> 09:54.040
I was... I was happy.

09:55.060 --> 09:57.530
I thought... that people that tried

09:57.580 --> 10:01.220
to kill themselves were... pathetic.

10:06.100 --> 10:09.300
But I just... can't get it out of my head.

10:11.740 --> 10:16.620
That's me, out there, on the
internet, for anyone to see.

10:19.020 --> 10:21.360
And I just want it to go away.

10:22.740 --> 10:24.080
But I...

10:24.860 --> 10:26.290
I just...

10:26.340 --> 10:28.280
I know it never will.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.820
What happened is awful.

10:32.700 --> 10:36.970
But Liam and Frankie are dead. The
police think that what happened

10:37.020 --> 10:40.020
to them is linked to what happened to you.

10:41.860 --> 10:43.730
Did you tell anyone?

10:45.580 --> 10:47.580
Did you tell your dad?

10:56.700 --> 10:59.010
Why did you lie to us, Mr Teller?

10:59.060 --> 11:02.060
You said you didn't
know about the footage.

11:02.540 --> 11:04.610
We know that's not true.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.170
Your daughter just informed a doctor.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.700
When did she tell you?

11:17.460 --> 11:19.530
A couple of days after.

11:20.180 --> 11:24.010
She found out that one of those
little bastards had uploaded it.

11:24.060 --> 11:25.770
She was going out of her mind.

11:25.820 --> 11:27.970
But you didn't approach the police. Why?

11:28.020 --> 11:30.370
Didn't want to draw attention to it.

11:30.420 --> 11:32.650
And I thought I could handle it myself.

11:32.700 --> 11:34.840
What do you mean by that?

11:35.580 --> 11:38.580
I wanted to get that
filth off the internet.

11:39.860 --> 11:41.930
All I could think about
was some old pervert

11:41.980 --> 11:44.980
sat at his computer
watching my little girl.

11:45.780 --> 11:48.370
- They put it up there. They can get it off.
- So, you threatened him?

11:48.420 --> 11:52.210
- Oh, yeah. - One of the young
men had a historic head fracture

11:52.260 --> 11:54.530
that can't be accounted for.

11:55.380 --> 11:57.290
- That was you?
- Damn right.

11:57.340 --> 12:00.420
I took a baseball bat to
that little prick's head.

12:03.380 --> 12:07.090
Took every ounce of my self-control
to stop myself from killing him.

12:07.140 --> 12:11.140
But you threatened him. You
threatened to kill both of them.

12:12.140 --> 12:14.340
You said you had daughters.

12:15.580 --> 12:18.260
Imagine your daughter was...

12:20.180 --> 12:21.450
Raped.

12:26.300 --> 12:28.240
She's my little girl.

12:35.660 --> 12:37.850
I didn't kill those boys.

12:37.900 --> 12:39.850
But when you find out who did,

12:39.900 --> 12:41.930
will you let me know, so I
can shake them by the hand?

12:41.980 --> 12:44.050
You've already confessed to two assaults,

12:44.100 --> 12:46.450
on Frankie McAteer and Jason Bradwell.

12:46.500 --> 12:49.170
You need to start remembering
where you were last night,

12:49.220 --> 12:51.170
cos if we can't establish
your whereabouts,

12:51.220 --> 12:54.620
a GBH charge is gonna be
the least of your worries.

12:58.700 --> 12:59.890
No need to worry.

12:59.940 --> 13:03.340
- We're just eliminating
you from the scene. - Yeah.

13:03.660 --> 13:05.060
Last one.

13:11.100 --> 13:13.900
- That's it. - Right, I'm done? - Mm-hm.

13:21.060 --> 13:22.530
Is he here?

13:23.980 --> 13:25.520
He is, yeah.

13:31.420 --> 13:33.490
You're Frankie's father.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.170
You have a right to see him.

13:42.540 --> 13:45.140
I'm sorry for your loss, Mr McAteer.

13:48.180 --> 13:49.490
It's not my loss.

13:49.540 --> 13:52.540
Bill was his dad in
every way that mattered.

13:54.380 --> 13:56.370
You never told your brother?

13:56.420 --> 13:58.210
I thought about it.

13:58.260 --> 14:01.260
But Bill loved his boy,
his boy loved Bill.

14:02.820 --> 14:04.820
Anyone could see that.

14:10.420 --> 14:12.290
I thought about it.

14:19.340 --> 14:20.940
What a night!

14:23.060 --> 14:24.170
Oh, man, I'm wasted!

14:24.220 --> 14:25.930
Nikki?

14:25.980 --> 14:27.920
You have to see this.

14:28.460 --> 14:30.130
And this is my main man, Frankie.

14:30.180 --> 14:33.170
- Clarissa, I really don't want to...
- Neither do I.

14:33.220 --> 14:37.050
This is the raw footage from
Liam's mobile that was recovered

14:37.100 --> 14:40.090
last night. The video he uploaded,
the video on Frankie's phone,

14:40.140 --> 14:41.650
had been edited right down.

14:41.700 --> 14:45.540
- And this... this is Becky.
- Watch.

14:47.500 --> 14:49.240
Beautiful Becky.

14:52.580 --> 14:54.170
Mate, your girlfriend is so fit.

14:54.220 --> 14:56.420
I know, mate!

14:59.660 --> 15:00.930
There.

15:02.020 --> 15:03.740
Rewind.

15:15.660 --> 15:16.770
Do you know him?

15:16.820 --> 15:18.820
It's Becky's flatmate.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.010
She said that she told
him about the assault,

15:22.060 --> 15:23.810
but she never said he was actually there.

15:23.860 --> 15:25.860
Maybe she didn't know.

16:44.380 --> 16:46.450
I'm just saying the fact
Paul Kirkeby was there

16:46.500 --> 16:49.410
- may not mean that much.
- It does mean he knew what happened that night.

16:49.460 --> 16:52.050
And that makes him what?
A potential murderer?

16:52.100 --> 16:54.450
If the killer's motive is to
take revenge on anybody involved

16:54.500 --> 16:57.700
in what happened to Becky, he
could be a potential victim.

16:59.340 --> 17:01.970
The police still have Stuart
Teller in custody, don't they?

17:02.020 --> 17:04.490
So maybe it doesn't matter. But
they should be told, in any case.

17:04.540 --> 17:08.089
- That doesn't make sense. - Of course
they should! - Not that -- this.

17:08.140 --> 17:10.569
The blood left by the gunman who shot Liam

17:10.619 --> 17:13.450
doesn't match the DNA
on the cigarette dropped

17:13.500 --> 17:15.569
by the McAteer killer.

17:15.619 --> 17:17.609
Yeah, but the same gun
was used in both cases.

17:17.660 --> 17:20.650
So, maybe it wasn't the gunman
who dropped the cigarette

17:20.700 --> 17:21.770
in the garage forecourt.

17:21.819 --> 17:25.940
Or, the blood you found
at the flat isn't his.

18:01.340 --> 18:03.580
Where are you going?

18:24.340 --> 18:26.410
Back out the front door?

18:36.170 --> 18:37.170
Yep.

18:37.220 --> 18:38.460
Huh.

19:20.860 --> 19:24.650
The fact that the DNA from both
killings didn't match bothered me.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.370
I mean, we know it was the same gun,

19:26.420 --> 19:29.730
- so it had to be the same shooter, right?
- You don't think it was?

19:29.780 --> 19:30.850
I'm not saying that.

19:30.900 --> 19:33.090
I'm saying that the person
who ran out the back door

19:33.140 --> 19:36.010
just before you arrived wasn't the gunman.

19:36.940 --> 19:41.090
I remembered this little quirk I read.

19:41.140 --> 19:45.250
When you put Guinness under
UV light, it luminesces.

19:45.300 --> 19:47.450
Lights up bright green.

19:47.500 --> 19:52.170
Now, the gunman stepped in
Guinness. I followed his steps.

19:52.220 --> 19:55.810
He approached the point
where Liam's body was found.

19:55.860 --> 19:58.370
Presumably that's when
he finished him off.

19:58.420 --> 20:01.890
But does he go anywhere near
the back door? He does not.

20:01.940 --> 20:06.050
He exits the way he came
in. Out the front door.

20:06.100 --> 20:08.890
So who was the bloke I saw
running from the flats?

20:08.940 --> 20:11.530
I don't know, but it wasn't the gunman.

20:11.580 --> 20:13.850
There were three people
in that room -- Liam,

20:13.900 --> 20:15.970
the killer and someone else.

20:16.020 --> 20:17.890
What about Paul Kirkeby?

20:17.940 --> 20:21.530
I cross-referenced all the
data on Liam's phone to see if

20:21.580 --> 20:24.050
I could find any correlation
with Paul Kirkeby.

20:24.100 --> 20:26.050
Just one hit. A phone call.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.370
From Liam to Paul on the day he died...

20:28.420 --> 20:30.850
And we know from the footage
found on Liam's phone

20:30.900 --> 20:33.650
that Paul was at his apartment
on the night Becky was assaulted.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.700
He knew what happened.

20:46.740 --> 20:48.680
Are you following me?

20:53.260 --> 20:55.730
Talked about the funerals today.

20:57.260 --> 21:03.500
Father Gallagher suggested they're
buried side by side, father and son.

21:07.740 --> 21:11.090
I couldn't -- and I didn't want to...

21:11.140 --> 21:13.650
No, no, no. It's good.

21:13.700 --> 21:17.020
It's... It's great.

21:20.180 --> 21:22.210
I saw him today.

21:22.260 --> 21:25.060
I saw Frankie.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.490
It wasn't my idea.

21:29.540 --> 21:31.540
I...

21:33.860 --> 21:36.380
I, um....

21:39.140 --> 21:40.980
I'm glad.

21:45.140 --> 21:47.100
Glad you saw him.

21:48.180 --> 21:50.100
Yeah, so am I.

21:54.260 --> 21:55.650
Carol...

21:55.700 --> 21:57.610
You want to be a father to that boy?

21:57.660 --> 21:59.690
You find out who did this.

21:59.740 --> 22:02.650
You find 'em, and you tear
them to pieces, d'you hear me?

22:02.700 --> 22:04.300
You find 'em!

22:08.180 --> 22:09.780
Sorry.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.840
Woody? It's me, Tommy McAteer.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.020
Paul Kirkeby?

22:36.180 --> 22:39.850
I'm DCI Underhill. This is DI Tanner.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.930
You all right, son?

22:41.980 --> 22:46.970
Don't tell her, please.
Don't tell her I saw.

22:47.020 --> 22:49.490
We won't have to, unless
it becomes relevant.

22:49.540 --> 22:52.970
Why is it so important that Becky doesn't
know you saw what happened, Paul?

22:53.020 --> 22:56.460
Because I'm her friend. Because
it nearly destroyed her.

22:57.620 --> 22:59.210
She's ashamed. If she knew...

22:59.260 --> 23:02.970
You're worried that she might
not want to look at you again.

23:03.020 --> 23:05.610
But she told you afterwards.
Told you what happened.

23:05.660 --> 23:10.410
Not all of it. They'd been drinking,
smoking. She was barely conscious.

23:10.460 --> 23:13.410
She doesn't remember much. She doesn't
understand exactly what happened.

23:13.460 --> 23:14.610
But you do.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.130
They took advantage of her.

23:16.180 --> 23:17.610
- But you didn't.
- No!

23:17.660 --> 23:19.170
No, you weren't involved in any way.

23:19.220 --> 23:20.890
Of course not!

23:20.940 --> 23:22.210
I'd been out.

23:22.260 --> 23:25.570
So when you came back, when you saw what
was happening, why didn't you stop it?

23:25.620 --> 23:27.450
Because you were afraid?

23:27.500 --> 23:29.290
Did you know Liam and Frankie well?

23:29.340 --> 23:30.610
- No.
- But you knew them?

23:30.660 --> 23:33.130
- Yes. - Knew them well enough for
Liam to have your phone number.

23:33.180 --> 23:34.290
I don't know. Maybe.

23:34.340 --> 23:37.090
Maybe? Definitely. He called
you yesterday at around 5pm.

23:37.140 --> 23:38.890
The same day he was murdered.

23:38.940 --> 23:41.570
He was murdered, and the
last call he made was to you.

23:41.620 --> 23:44.650
Yeah, that's... that's
right. Yeah, I remember now.

23:44.700 --> 23:48.570
- Now? This was yesterday. - Becky
had been admitted to hospital. I
hadn't been thinking straight.

23:48.620 --> 23:50.810
- What did he want to speak to you about?
- I don't know!

23:50.860 --> 23:52.210
Was he warning you, maybe?

23:52.260 --> 23:55.010
- Why would he want to warn me?
- Maybe he thought you were in danger, too.

23:55.060 --> 23:56.410
Maybe you went to see him.

23:56.460 --> 23:58.810
No. Absolutely not.

23:58.860 --> 24:00.850
Look, I answered the call,

24:00.900 --> 24:02.690
but as soon as I heard
his voice, I cut it off.

24:02.740 --> 24:04.530
- Why? - Because I didn't
want to speak to him.

24:04.580 --> 24:06.890
- Because you were angry about
what he did to Becky. - Yes!

24:06.940 --> 24:09.940
You really care about
her, don't you, Paul?

24:11.020 --> 24:12.380
Yes.

24:14.060 --> 24:18.050
Look, I-I don't know why
Liam tried to call me.

24:18.100 --> 24:20.290
Perhaps he was trying to
get in touch with Becky,

24:20.340 --> 24:23.500
and that that when he couldn't
contact her, he tried me.

24:27.860 --> 24:31.810
OK, Paul, I can see that
you're finding this stressful.

24:31.860 --> 24:34.170
Just so we can cover all eventualities,

24:34.220 --> 24:38.220
appreciate it if you could tell us exactly
where you've been the past couple of nights.

24:43.100 --> 24:46.010
OK, so, Kirkeby's alibi
checks out both nights.

24:46.060 --> 24:48.730
He stayed over in Manchester
on a training course.

24:48.780 --> 24:50.410
Didn't finish until lunchtime,

24:50.460 --> 24:53.770
so he wasn't even in the city
when the McAteers were killed.

24:53.820 --> 24:56.770
And then last night he was in
the pub. Barman remembers him.

24:56.820 --> 24:58.210
He was drunk out of his skull.

24:58.260 --> 25:00.370
Knocked over a table as
he left around midnight.

25:00.420 --> 25:02.770
So he can't've been the third
person in the flat last night.

25:02.820 --> 25:05.330
Yeah, but he's definitely
hiding something. Jumpy as hell.

25:05.380 --> 25:08.490
Yeah, but we know how much he cares about
Becky, and that does give him motive.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.730
With that alibi, you're
looking at accessory at best.

25:10.780 --> 25:13.410
Could he have been working with
Teller? Feeding him information?

25:13.460 --> 25:15.690
Have you established Teller's
presence in the flat?

25:15.740 --> 25:18.450
Turned the place upside down. Can't
find anything to put him there.

25:18.500 --> 25:20.250
Yeah, but absence of evidence

25:20.300 --> 25:24.170
doesn't mean evidence of absence if
he's prepared, forensically aware.

25:24.220 --> 25:27.250
We are missing something here.

25:27.300 --> 25:30.970
Cast iron alibi or not, Kirkeby
has to be involved somehow, right?

25:31.020 --> 25:34.540
Sorry to interrupt. Jack, we've got
a stabbing victim, West London.

25:36.300 --> 25:38.250
What did the police want?

25:38.300 --> 25:40.770
They were asking about your dad.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.610
Have you spoken to him?

25:44.260 --> 25:45.610
What did they ask?

25:45.660 --> 25:47.930
What he knew.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.970
When he knew it.

25:50.020 --> 25:51.690
What did you tell them?

25:51.740 --> 25:53.570
The truth.

25:53.620 --> 25:54.850
And that he didn't do it.

25:54.900 --> 25:56.450
You don't know that.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.650
Yes, I do.

25:58.700 --> 26:01.850
This is your dad we're
talking about, Becky.

26:01.900 --> 26:04.490
He couldn't do something like that.

26:04.540 --> 26:07.690
It's not a coincidence they're both dead.

26:07.740 --> 26:11.530
I saw his face when I told
him what happened. The rage...

26:11.580 --> 26:13.490
It-it scared me.

26:13.540 --> 26:16.770
If I hadn't told him, if I'd
just kept it to myself...

26:16.820 --> 26:21.250
You can't blame yourself.
None of this is your fault.

26:21.300 --> 26:23.010
Come on. You go to bed.

26:23.060 --> 26:25.700
The doctors said you had to rest.

26:26.740 --> 26:30.940
I'm sorry. I'm sorry you had to find me.

26:33.020 --> 26:34.890
I just panicked, and I just wasn't...

26:34.940 --> 26:37.530
- Don't ever say that.
- .. thinking...

26:37.580 --> 26:39.250
Never be sorry.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.840
I'm so lucky to have you.

26:56.980 --> 26:59.170
Brilliant, thanks.

26:59.220 --> 27:00.650
Have we got a name?

27:00.700 --> 27:02.690
Clive Maitland. Deputy Head.

27:02.740 --> 27:05.330
Croxley Park Academy. Just left work.

27:05.380 --> 27:06.690
What, dressed like this?

27:06.740 --> 27:08.970
Yeah, he was headed to the gym.

27:09.020 --> 27:13.490
Colleagues say he went every
day after work. 50 years old.

27:13.540 --> 27:16.330
Trying to get back in shape. Poor bugger.

27:16.380 --> 27:19.290
I know the feeling. Any
thoughts on motive?

27:19.340 --> 27:20.890
Well, his wallet was emptied

27:20.940 --> 27:23.940
so they're running with
robbery gone wrong.

27:24.700 --> 27:26.570
Yeah, I don't buy it, either.

27:26.620 --> 27:28.930
The victim has multiple stab wounds,

27:28.980 --> 27:31.250
separated into two distinct clusters.

27:31.300 --> 27:32.650
Three wounds in the abdomen.

27:32.700 --> 27:34.970
The majority of the blood...

27:35.540 --> 27:38.530
Yeah, seems to have issued from
the uppermost of these three.

27:38.580 --> 27:40.770
- May have hit the celiac artery.
- He may.

27:40.820 --> 27:42.370
The wounds are elliptical in shape,

27:42.420 --> 27:44.330
suggesting the knife was doubled-edged.

27:44.380 --> 27:47.810
Also, yeah, there are small
contusions above and below

27:47.860 --> 27:50.890
each wound, which may indicate the
weapon had some sort of fingerguard.

27:50.940 --> 27:52.130
So what do you think?

27:52.180 --> 27:54.850
Combat knife bought for the
job, rather than a kitchen knife?

27:54.900 --> 27:56.730
Possibly, yeah.

27:56.780 --> 27:58.210
A blush of bruising.

27:58.260 --> 28:01.060
Maybe. Anything else?

28:02.660 --> 28:09.050
Discoid bruising suggests the attacker grabbed
the back of his neck with his right hand...

28:09.100 --> 28:12.500
Whilst pushing the knife
in with his left...

28:15.340 --> 28:16.810
Thank you.

28:19.100 --> 28:23.210
The wounds in the chest angle downwards.

28:23.260 --> 28:27.650
Don't know. Suggests maybe they
were inflicted once the victim had

28:27.700 --> 28:30.530
fallen backwards onto the floor,
his attacker straddling him,

28:30.580 --> 28:32.410
knife held in a reverse grip.

28:32.460 --> 28:34.290
Four, five, six -- seven stab wounds.

28:34.340 --> 28:36.680
He really wanted to make sure.

28:37.860 --> 28:41.570
I've got blood. Back of the collar.

28:41.620 --> 28:46.210
Given the location, it's unlikely
to be spatter from the wounds.

28:46.260 --> 28:49.650
This wound is ragged round the
edges. So are a few of the others.

28:49.700 --> 28:51.610
Either he had two weapons, or...

28:51.660 --> 28:54.290
Or the weapon he was using
was damaged in the act.

28:54.340 --> 28:57.930
Yeah, there's a distinct
mark, here on the sternum.

28:57.980 --> 29:00.320
Can you get me some tweezers?

29:01.260 --> 29:04.020
It looks as if the knife hit square on.

29:12.420 --> 29:14.620
Sternum one, knife nil.

29:16.140 --> 29:17.850
Anything interesting?

29:17.900 --> 29:19.290
Yeah, blood on the victim's collar.

29:19.340 --> 29:21.130
It's a possibility it
came from the attacker.

29:21.180 --> 29:22.410
Well, makes sense.

29:22.460 --> 29:25.530
We found bruising suggesting the
victim was grabbed by the neck.

29:25.580 --> 29:29.450
This knife tip from the
victim's chest -- unusual.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.700
Think you can find a make?

29:32.540 --> 29:34.010
We can try.

29:43.660 --> 29:45.130
Are you OK?

29:45.180 --> 29:47.490
Fine. You?

29:47.540 --> 29:50.930
That noise. What was it?

29:50.980 --> 29:54.450
Um, I've been putting some pictures up.

29:54.500 --> 29:57.010
Are you sure you're OK, Paul?

29:57.060 --> 29:58.780
Me? Of course.

30:00.820 --> 30:03.020
I'm sorry about the noise.

30:03.940 --> 30:05.410
'Night.

30:05.460 --> 30:06.800
'Night.

30:19.580 --> 30:21.370
Morning.

30:21.420 --> 30:22.770
Can you come here a second?

30:22.820 --> 30:25.290
You did go home last night?

30:25.340 --> 30:29.130
I need you to check this, because
I can't believe what I'm seeing...

30:29.180 --> 30:33.970
DNA results from the blood
on Maitland's collar, right?

30:34.020 --> 30:35.500
OK.

30:39.980 --> 30:43.770
OK, same DNA. So where's
this sample come from?

30:43.820 --> 30:46.610
Tommy McAteer's back yard.

30:46.660 --> 30:51.570
Whoever killed Clive Maitland was also present
in McAteer's flat when Liam was killed.

30:51.620 --> 30:53.650
Somehow, these cases are linked.

30:53.700 --> 30:56.850
We're all absolutely devastated.

30:56.900 --> 31:00.770
Mr Maitland was one of the
transformational teachers. You know?

31:00.820 --> 31:05.410
I mean, you ask anyone in this community,

31:05.460 --> 31:09.820
and I guarantee they'll know someone
whose life he helped turn around.

31:11.740 --> 31:13.810
It's just so senseless.

31:16.460 --> 31:21.810
How can the murder of a 51-year-old
school teacher from the other side
of town be linked to this case?

31:21.860 --> 31:25.210
Unrelated victims. Different MO.

31:25.260 --> 31:27.330
The blade's coated in polytetrafluoroethylene.

31:27.380 --> 31:29.090
- In English?
- Teflon.

31:29.140 --> 31:31.730
Does that suggest we could be looking
at a kitchen knife after all?

31:31.780 --> 31:33.810
I don't think so.

31:33.860 --> 31:35.450
It's double-edged, for a start,

31:35.500 --> 31:38.970
and extrapolating from this
fragment and your post-mortem,

31:39.020 --> 31:42.370
I'd say that we're looking at
a Teflon-coated stiletto knife.

31:42.420 --> 31:44.290
You'd have to order that from abroad.

31:44.340 --> 31:46.570
Which suggests the
killing was pre-planned.

31:46.620 --> 31:47.770
Hang on a second.

31:47.820 --> 31:51.020
Liam and Frankie's murders
were both gun crimes.

31:51.980 --> 31:54.090
We're looking at two different killers.

31:54.140 --> 31:56.330
One shot the McAteers and Stanwell,

31:56.380 --> 31:57.930
the other stabbed Maitland.

31:57.980 --> 32:00.010
That's the man you saw running away.

32:00.060 --> 32:02.170
And the blood we found in the backyard?

32:02.220 --> 32:03.690
Same blood on Maitland's collar.

32:03.740 --> 32:06.970
So what you're saying is, although
we've got Stuart Teller in custody,

32:07.020 --> 32:08.410
he couldn't have killed Maitland,

32:08.460 --> 32:10.890
but he could have still carried
out the other two murders.

32:10.940 --> 32:14.570
Correct. So, if Teller's our gunman,
how does he link to stiletto knife man?

32:14.620 --> 32:18.170
He was ex-military, wasn't he? Might
he have drafted in a colleague?

32:18.220 --> 32:20.250
We're exploring that, but no joy so far.

32:20.300 --> 32:23.130
Wait. Are we looking
at this the wrong way?

32:23.180 --> 32:26.890
Rather than trying to find the
link between the assailants,

32:26.940 --> 32:30.140
maybe we should be focusing on
the link between the victims.

32:57.940 --> 33:02.370
Thanks for agreeing to meet me here,
Michael. Seemed to make sense.

33:02.420 --> 33:06.410
I, er, understand you told one of my
colleagues you wanted to see your father's body.

33:06.460 --> 33:09.210
I was hoping we could talk about him.

33:09.260 --> 33:12.690
I don't know what I can tell you that
I haven't already told your colleagues.

33:12.740 --> 33:17.170
I'm on the investigation that might have
some bearing on your father's murder.

33:17.220 --> 33:19.530
I'm sorry? I don't understand.

33:19.580 --> 33:23.140
Did your father ever mention
someone called Frankie McAteer?

33:25.540 --> 33:27.250
Liam Stanwell?

33:27.300 --> 33:29.040
They ex-students?

33:29.820 --> 33:32.620
No. Why d'you say that?

33:33.580 --> 33:35.810
I already told the other
police officers...

33:35.860 --> 33:37.530
I know, and I'm sorry.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.530
But if you could just tell me.

33:39.580 --> 33:42.610
My dad had worked at
Croxley Park all his career.

33:42.660 --> 33:45.860
Never had any problems. Loved
the school, loved the kids.

33:47.900 --> 33:51.250
Couple of months ago, he had
a run-in with two ex-students

33:51.300 --> 33:54.490
who were selling weed
outside the school gates.

33:54.540 --> 33:57.570
He confronted them. One
of them pulled a knife...

33:57.620 --> 33:59.930
It has to be him.

33:59.980 --> 34:03.130
He was the last person to enter that
alley before the girl who found the body.

34:03.180 --> 34:04.690
Can you fast forward?

34:04.740 --> 34:06.450
Yep.

34:06.500 --> 34:09.929
Stop. Turned right.

34:09.980 --> 34:13.179
Now, you've been there --
where would he be going?

34:15.300 --> 34:16.370
Jack?

34:16.420 --> 34:20.050
It's not where he's going,
it's what he's left behind.

34:20.100 --> 34:23.219
He was carrying a plastic bag
when he went down the alley.

34:26.219 --> 34:28.100
He's dumped it.

34:33.460 --> 34:35.969
You all right, mate? You Tommy McAteer?

34:36.020 --> 34:37.690
Yeah, that's me.

34:37.739 --> 34:40.570
Nice one. Yeah, well,
Woody told me to come here.

34:40.620 --> 34:42.290
Something about you needing a car.

34:42.340 --> 34:45.969
Now, Woody tells me you
nicked a car five nights back.

34:46.020 --> 34:48.620
Black Nissan X-Trail. Is that right?

34:49.219 --> 34:52.219
Shit, mate -- look, if
that was your motor...

34:54.420 --> 34:57.010
Now...

34:57.060 --> 35:00.260
I only want to hear two
words from you now, son.

35:00.820 --> 35:02.890
The name of the man you sold it to.

35:02.940 --> 35:04.770
But you've searched here, right?

35:04.820 --> 35:06.610
Obviously not well enough.

35:06.660 --> 35:09.820
- Well, the bins? That's the
first place you'd look. - We did.

35:25.620 --> 35:27.220
Got something.

35:30.700 --> 35:32.530
Urgh!

35:32.580 --> 35:34.250
Watch yourself.

35:49.700 --> 35:51.300
There you go.

35:52.300 --> 35:53.570
He'd scouted the area.

35:53.620 --> 35:56.620
Knew exactly where he
was going to dump it.

36:49.540 --> 36:50.810
New phone?

36:50.860 --> 36:52.620
Er, yeah.

37:04.100 --> 37:05.490
You going?

37:05.540 --> 37:08.330
Er... bottle of wine.

37:08.380 --> 37:10.170
Paul, is there something wrong?

37:10.220 --> 37:11.610
Of course not.

37:11.660 --> 37:14.450
If there was, you'd tell me, right?

37:48.540 --> 37:51.530
Traced the knife to the manufacturer
using the serial code on the blade.

37:51.580 --> 37:54.130
It was shipped from Italy two weeks ago.

37:54.180 --> 37:55.410
Address?

37:55.460 --> 37:58.010
Well, the buyer stipulated
a collection locker,

37:58.060 --> 38:01.010
so we can try to trace,
but it might be difficult.

38:01.060 --> 38:02.410
How did he pay?

38:02.460 --> 38:05.730
- They won't say. - We could try to get the
Italian courts to force them to disclose.

38:05.780 --> 38:07.730
I'll be pensioned off before that happens.

38:07.780 --> 38:12.130
Was Maitland's son able to give you any
insight as to how the victims might be linked?

38:12.180 --> 38:15.290
Nothing. Dad talked about some
skirmish with a couple of ex-students,

38:15.340 --> 38:16.530
one of them pulled a knife.

38:16.580 --> 38:20.690
- Would a kid really go to the trouble of
ordering a specialist knife like that? - Whoa...

38:20.740 --> 38:23.930
Are you having a moment, Jack, or is there
something you'd like to share with us?

38:23.980 --> 38:26.850
I looked at trace residues
on the knife blade.

38:26.900 --> 38:28.810
It tests positive for toner ink.

38:28.860 --> 38:30.530
Toner ink?

38:30.580 --> 38:32.610
Toner ink. Like the stuff
you use in a laser printer.

38:32.660 --> 38:34.410
Yeah, I know what it is,
but how is it relevant?

38:34.460 --> 38:37.490
How often do you actually have
to change a toner cartridge?

38:37.540 --> 38:39.930
This is either a massive coincidence,

38:39.980 --> 38:42.050
or we're looking at someone
who does this all the time.

38:42.100 --> 38:44.450
Who do we know who works
in a print shop? Becky.

38:44.500 --> 38:46.770
Yeah, and her flatmate Paul.

38:55.140 --> 38:57.210
Hi, Becky. Is Paul here?

38:58.220 --> 39:00.460
No. He... just nipped out.

39:02.460 --> 39:05.090
Paul ever talk to you
about someone called...

39:05.140 --> 39:06.890
Clive Maitland?

39:06.940 --> 39:08.010
No.

39:08.060 --> 39:10.730
D'you know where Paul
was yesterday afternoon?

39:10.780 --> 39:11.890
No,

39:11.940 --> 39:15.050
I-I only saw him when he got
back from talking to you.

39:15.100 --> 39:19.010
Yeah, we noticed that he
seemed distracted, anxious.

39:19.060 --> 39:23.540
He's been acting strange since...
I got back from hospital.

39:25.260 --> 39:28.250
First I thought it was
because of what I'd done.

39:28.300 --> 39:31.130
Look, I know you're worried about him...

39:31.180 --> 39:34.970
and it's possible that he's got
himself mixed up in something,

39:35.020 --> 39:37.130
and we need to get him out.

39:37.180 --> 39:41.820
So Becky, if there's anything you can
think of that might help us help him...

39:44.620 --> 39:49.170
He smashed up his computer,

39:49.220 --> 39:51.210
and his phone.

39:51.260 --> 39:53.250
We waited at the shop, he didn't show.

39:53.300 --> 39:55.770
Becky tried calling, no
answer. Print shop's closed.

39:55.820 --> 39:58.010
She says he's been acting
weird ever since yesterday.

39:58.060 --> 39:59.450
When Maitland was murdered.

39:59.500 --> 40:01.850
We know Kirkeby left the
shop at three o'clock.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.370
That gave him an hour to get
across town to kill Maitland.

40:04.420 --> 40:07.210
We picked him up on his
return to the flat.

40:07.260 --> 40:10.370
Chances are he'd just come
straight from the crime scene.

40:10.420 --> 40:11.690
Do we think he knew Maitland?

40:11.740 --> 40:13.690
Well, Becky can't think why he would.

40:13.740 --> 40:16.170
Totally different lines of
work, different part of town.

40:16.220 --> 40:18.970
The chances of them crossing in a
city of eight million! Yeah, right.

40:19.020 --> 40:21.490
So what's the motive? Even
if it was a random killing,

40:21.540 --> 40:25.090
why head across town to select a
victim? It doesn't make sense.

40:25.140 --> 40:29.530
I don't know. But I've got a smashed-up laptop
and a mobile phone that might shine a light.

40:29.580 --> 40:31.210
You reckon you might
be able to get access?

40:31.260 --> 40:32.530
How badly damaged?

40:32.580 --> 40:35.730
Put it this way. If it was a
car got smashed up like this,

40:35.780 --> 40:38.090
the insurers wouldn't even
bother opening the bonnet.

40:38.140 --> 40:39.410
Can you do something or not?

40:39.460 --> 40:42.090
Hate to say it, but, er,

40:42.140 --> 40:44.810
Max specialises in data recovery.

40:44.860 --> 40:46.660
Can we do it here?

40:48.340 --> 40:49.880
Go on, then.

40:51.300 --> 40:53.060
'Is that a yes?'

40:54.340 --> 40:56.410
Fine. We'll come get it.

41:16.740 --> 41:18.050
Good afternoon, Emma.

41:18.100 --> 41:19.610
Afternoon. There we are.

41:19.660 --> 41:20.890
Hi.

41:20.940 --> 41:22.820
Hi there. Thank you.

41:25.180 --> 41:26.720
You're here!

41:28.220 --> 41:30.170
- Welcome!
- Maximilian.

41:30.220 --> 41:31.850
Jackson.

41:31.900 --> 41:33.700
- Shall we?
- Mm.

41:41.020 --> 41:42.730
I've seen worse.

41:42.780 --> 41:45.850
I've just restored a laptop
that'd been smashed up,

41:45.900 --> 41:48.810
then burnt by a blowtorch
and then dumped in a river.

41:48.860 --> 41:50.290
99% data recovery.

41:50.340 --> 41:51.890
It's impressive.

41:51.940 --> 41:55.340
People think computers are
delicate as bone china...

41:56.020 --> 41:58.090
.. and everything disappears
like it was never there.

41:58.140 --> 42:00.410
If you're serious, you need
to get an angle grinder...

42:00.460 --> 42:03.580
Can you access it, Max? Yes or no.

42:16.780 --> 42:19.980
This better be good, Tom,
cos I'm up to my neck.

42:22.660 --> 42:26.810
The car used by the gunman... He
commissioned the theft online.

42:26.860 --> 42:29.330
And that... that's your website.

42:32.860 --> 42:34.170
And this?

42:34.220 --> 42:37.580
That's the gunman. Or if
it ain't, he knows who is.

42:39.060 --> 42:41.930
Just check it out. That's all I'm saying.

42:46.340 --> 42:48.570
So I replaced the broken heads.

42:48.620 --> 42:52.010
The platter was a bit scratched,
but nothing too catastrophic.

42:52.060 --> 42:54.130
Um... Now, what does that say?

42:54.180 --> 42:57.330
100% data recovery.

42:58.860 --> 43:01.260
I have to admit, I'm impressed.

43:02.300 --> 43:05.850
That was Underhill. One of the
men was using an online identity.

43:05.900 --> 43:10.010
Dreadnought. We should cross-reference that
name with the data on Kirkeby's laptop.

43:10.060 --> 43:11.330
Oh, I'm ahead of you.

43:11.380 --> 43:14.610
Thinking they have some
kind of relationship online?

43:14.660 --> 43:15.850
Relationship?

43:15.900 --> 43:18.650
Judging by the amount of
correspondence I'm seeing here,

43:18.700 --> 43:21.010
- they were halfway
down the aisle. - Whoa!

43:21.060 --> 43:24.890
In the last month they were talking
on a forum non-stop, all day,

43:24.940 --> 43:26.620
every day...

43:29.060 --> 43:30.810
Hello, Paul.

43:30.860 --> 43:32.450
How d'you know my name?

43:32.500 --> 43:33.690
It wasn't that difficult.

43:33.740 --> 43:36.740
What am I supposed to
call you? Dreadnought?

43:37.420 --> 43:38.730
Why are we here?

43:38.780 --> 43:40.210
I wanted to know who you are.

43:40.260 --> 43:41.930
You know who I am.

43:41.980 --> 43:43.890
We're friends.

43:43.940 --> 43:48.370
Friends don't pressurise each other
to... to doing what we've done.

43:48.420 --> 43:49.770
You threatened me!

43:49.820 --> 43:52.730
You needed a push to go
through with it. I pushed.

43:52.780 --> 43:53.930
To kill someone?

43:53.980 --> 43:55.810
To do what you promised.

43:55.860 --> 43:57.450
And I dunno why you're angry.

43:57.500 --> 44:01.130
I should be the angry one. The
police have linked the murders.

44:01.180 --> 44:02.810
How?

44:02.860 --> 44:04.890
Don't know.

44:04.940 --> 44:06.740
But I was careful.

44:07.380 --> 44:09.330
Were YOU careful, Paul?

44:09.380 --> 44:12.090
The night Becky was
assaulted, Kirkeby was online.

44:12.140 --> 44:16.690
He spent two hours on this website
forum. He has friends there,

44:16.740 --> 44:19.930
and he alludes to something
bad happening to his flatmate.

44:19.980 --> 44:23.250
He can't talk about it. One
friend won't let it go.

44:23.300 --> 44:24.370
Dreadnought.

44:24.420 --> 44:25.770
Exactly.

44:25.820 --> 44:27.370
All this in a month?

44:27.420 --> 44:31.090
You can follow the narrative. I
mean, it starts off as venting.

44:31.140 --> 44:33.330
Paul's blowing off steam.

44:33.380 --> 44:35.810
Fantasist projections, for Paul at least.

44:35.860 --> 44:39.690
He's hurt, he's feeling impotent,
he wants revenge for Becky.

44:39.740 --> 44:42.970
He, er, he imagines
torturing Liam and Frankie

44:43.020 --> 44:45.130
but it's scary movie stuff.

44:45.180 --> 44:47.850
I'm not even sure Paul Kirkeby was
aware that he was planning a murder.

44:47.900 --> 44:49.010
But Dreadnought was.

44:49.060 --> 44:52.010
At first he's the friendly
ear, but that changes.

44:52.060 --> 44:55.810
He has his own axe to grind.
He says he's been abused,

44:55.860 --> 44:58.450
and he wants to find the
man. He wants justice.

44:58.500 --> 44:59.650
Clive Maitland?

44:59.700 --> 45:01.610
He doesn't mention Maitland by name.

45:01.660 --> 45:04.930
So he builds the fantasy,
feeds Kirkeby's anger.

45:04.980 --> 45:08.170
Yeah, and then it's Dreadnought
who suggests the murders.

45:08.220 --> 45:10.250
So, how does Stuart Teller fit into this?

45:10.300 --> 45:11.770
Well, he doesn't.

45:11.820 --> 45:15.250
Paul and Stuart know each
other in the real world.

45:15.300 --> 45:16.970
This relationship's born online.

45:17.020 --> 45:20.050
Well... how do we find Dreadnought?

45:20.100 --> 45:21.490
I don't know, Thomas.

45:21.540 --> 45:23.810
Nikki, you said something earlier.

45:23.860 --> 45:26.490
Find the link between the victims.

45:26.540 --> 45:28.570
But there IS no link between the victims.

45:28.620 --> 45:30.930
And there's the point. There's
no link between the victims,

45:30.980 --> 45:33.450
because there's no link between
the KILLERS, in the real world.

45:33.500 --> 45:36.290
Paul Kirkeby worships Becky.

45:36.340 --> 45:38.970
He knew what Frankie and Liam
had done, and he was angry.

45:39.020 --> 45:41.290
But he know he didn't kill
them. He's got an alibi!

45:41.340 --> 45:44.170
Of course he had an alibi for those
murders, because he didn't do them.

45:44.220 --> 45:46.010
Dreadnought did.

45:46.060 --> 45:48.970
Paul and Dreadnought.
Strangers On A Server.

45:49.020 --> 45:51.450
Each wants someone dead,
neither wants to get caught.

45:51.500 --> 45:53.490
So what do they do? They swap.

45:53.540 --> 45:54.890
They swap murders.

45:54.940 --> 45:58.410
You lied to me! You said he was an abuser!

45:58.460 --> 46:00.490
That he'd raped you, ruined your life.

46:00.540 --> 46:01.810
He DID ruin my life!

46:01.860 --> 46:04.370
No. He was just a... just a teacher.

46:04.420 --> 46:06.210
He was just an ordinary bloke.

46:06.260 --> 46:08.210
The kids that he taught, they loved him.

46:08.260 --> 46:09.250
They didn't know him.

46:09.300 --> 46:11.040
No. You're lying.

46:13.660 --> 46:18.940
How can I be sure he wasn't just
some random bloke you made me kill
just because you bloody could?

46:22.740 --> 46:24.080
Please!

46:26.660 --> 46:30.820
Please tell me the truth,
because I can't live with this.

46:32.500 --> 46:35.090
I pushed a knife into a stranger's body

46:35.140 --> 46:38.170
and I took away... his life.

46:38.220 --> 46:39.610
Are you following me?

46:39.660 --> 46:42.970
'I can't eat. I can't sleep.

46:43.020 --> 46:46.770
'Every time I close my
eyes, I see his face.

46:46.820 --> 46:49.420
'He was trying to understand why...'

46:59.380 --> 47:01.490
I know...

47:01.540 --> 47:03.940
you're looking for forgiveness.

47:05.100 --> 47:06.450
You don't need it.

47:06.500 --> 47:08.130
You killed for me,

47:08.180 --> 47:09.920
I killed for you.

47:11.900 --> 47:16.220
I'm not your enemy, Paul. I'm your friend.

47:17.380 --> 47:19.490
We found each other in the darkness.

47:19.540 --> 47:21.610
We raised each other up.

47:26.460 --> 47:28.570
You think that'll make everything better?

47:28.620 --> 47:31.730
I never wanted this. Any of it.

47:31.780 --> 47:35.130
Well, you're going to have
to learn to live with it.

47:35.180 --> 47:39.140
Because if you can't, if you weaken...

47:40.220 --> 47:42.290
.. I'll find her again.

47:43.260 --> 47:45.690
Do you understand?

47:45.740 --> 47:47.610
Do you understand?!

47:54.300 --> 47:56.450
'So we know Dreadnought's the prime mover?

47:56.500 --> 47:58.850
'Absolutely. He has the idea,'

47:58.900 --> 48:05.570
takes care of the practicalities,
he sources the gun, the car. Even
the stiletto knife Kirkeby used.

48:05.620 --> 48:07.970
So if Kirkeby's gone to ground,
how do we find Dreadnought?

48:08.020 --> 48:13.260
I don't know. But if Paul's motivation was
personal, then maybe Dreadnought's was, too.

48:23.540 --> 48:25.530
Did anyone follow you here?

48:25.580 --> 48:29.450
No, I don't think so. I
did just like you said.

48:29.500 --> 48:32.410
Changed tubes. Doubled back.

48:32.460 --> 48:35.610
Thank you. Thank you for coming.

48:35.660 --> 48:39.210
You won't thank me when
you know what I've done.

48:39.260 --> 48:41.970
I don't care. Whatever it is.

48:42.020 --> 48:47.010
Your phone, and computer... When
the police came to look for you...

48:47.060 --> 48:48.890
Really, Becky,

48:48.940 --> 48:51.280
none of that matters any more.

48:53.180 --> 48:54.780
I'm so scared.

48:56.740 --> 48:58.080
Paul...

49:00.180 --> 49:02.020
What's happening?

49:04.140 --> 49:06.610
D'you remember when we first met?

49:07.460 --> 49:09.570
Of course.

49:09.620 --> 49:12.170
- When you started working
at the shop... - No.

49:12.220 --> 49:15.660
No, it was at the Lamb and
Flag about three weeks before.

49:17.300 --> 49:19.640
You were drunk, and we talked.

49:22.500 --> 49:26.970
I fell in love with you that
night. Right there and then.

49:27.020 --> 49:30.420
You were the most magical
person that I'd ever met.

49:31.700 --> 49:34.040
You told me where you worked.

49:35.060 --> 49:39.210
I used to walk past the shop now and
again, trying to bump into you...

49:39.260 --> 49:42.300
and then a job came up, and I applied.

49:44.500 --> 49:45.930
When I first saw you at the shop,

49:45.980 --> 49:49.130
I was ready to make out it
was all this big coincidence,

49:49.180 --> 49:51.380
but you didn't remember me.

49:55.100 --> 49:58.700
Now, when I say it, it all
sounds kinda creepy, I know.

50:02.620 --> 50:05.730
They raped you, Becky. Frankie and Liam.

50:05.780 --> 50:06.770
Don't say that.

50:06.820 --> 50:10.700
I don't know if that's what they thought they
were doing, but it really doesn't matter.

50:13.020 --> 50:16.540
I was there, and I was
too scared to do anything.

50:21.540 --> 50:23.100
Argh!

50:24.060 --> 50:25.210
Why?!

50:25.260 --> 50:27.930
I know this changes everything.

50:27.980 --> 50:30.130
I know you won't ever want
to see me again, but...

50:30.180 --> 50:33.280
you needed to know what
they did to you, Becky.

50:37.780 --> 50:40.250
I think it's how you get better.

50:46.780 --> 50:49.540
Go. Just go.

50:51.700 --> 50:53.100
Please!

50:58.700 --> 51:01.810
Don't-Don't come back to the
flat tonight, go to your dad's.

51:01.860 --> 51:04.290
Please. Just give me this
one night to clear out,

51:04.340 --> 51:07.940
and then you can forget this
whole thing ever happened.

51:39.060 --> 51:42.690
'Society has to extract its petty
revenge however inhumane as it may be.

51:42.740 --> 51:46.210
'Don't get bitter, son, just
do your time and move on.

51:46.260 --> 51:49.250
'Well, I mean, will you?

51:49.300 --> 51:51.650
'It's not any of my business
why you're in here, but...

51:51.700 --> 51:54.140
'Oh, it was a heist...'

52:12.580 --> 52:14.610
Nikki...

52:14.660 --> 52:16.600
Clive Maitland's DNA.

52:17.540 --> 52:18.850
He's a paternal match.

52:18.900 --> 52:20.970
Paternal match for who?

52:22.020 --> 52:24.690
The man who gunned down the McAteers.

52:25.260 --> 52:28.020
The gunman's Clive Maitland's son.

52:43.580 --> 52:45.500
You came quickly.

52:49.780 --> 52:51.050
I can't live with this.

52:51.100 --> 52:52.440
I know.

52:54.180 --> 52:56.610
I've been trying to work out how
the police linked the murders.

52:56.660 --> 52:58.810
I went to the flat.

52:58.860 --> 53:01.650
Where Liam was staying.
It was probably that.

53:01.700 --> 53:05.010
Why would you do that?
We had it all planned.

53:05.060 --> 53:08.010
I can't live with this, any of it!

53:08.060 --> 53:09.770
You don't need to be scared, Paul.

53:09.820 --> 53:11.340
I'm not.

53:12.900 --> 53:15.240
I told you -- now you tell ME.

53:15.860 --> 53:17.090
Who was he?

53:17.140 --> 53:18.130
My father.

53:18.180 --> 53:19.650
Your father?

53:19.700 --> 53:20.650
Are you following me?

53:20.700 --> 53:22.500
- Why?
- Because.

53:23.660 --> 53:25.220
What?

53:27.700 --> 53:29.410
Shut up.

53:29.460 --> 53:30.980
SHUT UP!

53:34.700 --> 53:37.810
Single shot pierced the frontal
bone. Massive brain trauma.

53:37.860 --> 53:39.890
Death would have been
almost instantaneous.

53:39.940 --> 53:42.490
- Weapon? - Same gun used
to kill McAteer, Stanwell.

53:42.540 --> 53:45.090
Please tell me you can put
Michael Maitland in the flat?

53:45.140 --> 53:46.570
Not yet.

53:46.620 --> 53:48.090
But you have DNA evidence --

53:48.140 --> 53:50.210
the cigarette butt dropped
out of the SUV window.

53:50.260 --> 53:53.810
His brief's already suggested that Maitland
visited that garage earlier that same week.

53:53.860 --> 53:54.930
Scouting it out in advance.

53:54.980 --> 53:56.810
Or filling up with
petrol if you believe him.

53:56.860 --> 53:59.170
So unless we can prove that
the cigarette we found was

53:59.220 --> 54:03.100
indisputably dropped from that SUV
on the night in question, then...

54:04.820 --> 54:06.970
Thank you.

54:07.020 --> 54:10.340
For, um... For letting me see him.

54:12.100 --> 54:15.130
It's a very human need.

54:15.180 --> 54:19.220
Seeing the things that
upset us makes them real...

54:21.060 --> 54:23.260
.. and then we can move on.

54:27.180 --> 54:28.850
He said that...

54:35.340 --> 54:37.220
.. I was raped.

54:54.180 --> 54:58.450
Maitland has been released
pending further investigation.

54:58.500 --> 55:00.650
How is that even possible?

55:00.700 --> 55:03.850
The CPS don't think there's enough
evidence to launch a prosecution yet.

55:03.900 --> 55:07.410
But he's had to surrender
his passport. He can't run.

55:07.460 --> 55:09.970
- You thinking he might
wriggle out of this? - No.

55:10.020 --> 55:14.250
We've got some forensic evidence and
we're hoping we can pin him on it,

55:14.300 --> 55:18.450
but the bulk of the case rests on his
online interactions with Kirkeby.

55:18.500 --> 55:22.890
HTCU are working on it,
and it's a massive job.

55:22.940 --> 55:26.380
Big difference between what
we know and what we can prove.

55:28.700 --> 55:32.140
Have faith, Mrs McAteer. He'll
get what's coming to him.

55:37.940 --> 55:39.770
Ah, Max.

55:39.820 --> 55:41.050
Excuse me a second.

55:41.100 --> 55:43.210
Thanks a lot for all your assistance.

55:43.260 --> 55:45.090
Oh -- always happy to collaborate.

55:45.140 --> 55:47.610
And, um, if you ever want to kick
some of your employees my way

55:47.660 --> 55:49.290
for a little training...

55:49.340 --> 55:51.970
- What's wrong, Jack?
- I'll tell you what's wrong.

55:52.020 --> 55:55.050
I'm... a bit worried he's going
to try and tempt you away.

55:55.100 --> 55:57.410
- Well, he does try.
- I knew it!

55:57.460 --> 56:00.290
Well, he tries because Max is
Max and he can't help himself.

56:00.340 --> 56:01.890
He knows I'll never say yes.

56:01.940 --> 56:03.330
Big pay rise, swanky office.

56:03.380 --> 56:05.210
And leave all this?

56:05.260 --> 56:06.450
You never know.

56:06.500 --> 56:09.730
No. I like it down here
with the blood and the bones.

56:09.780 --> 56:12.450
Besides -- you'd be lost without me.

56:12.500 --> 56:13.970
Proper catch-up soon?

56:14.020 --> 56:15.090
Absolutely.

56:15.140 --> 56:18.250
- Right. And I'll see you at home.
- Mm-hm.

56:18.300 --> 56:20.840
- Text me when you leave?
- Yeah.

56:21.500 --> 56:24.410
I know I married him for his mind, but...

56:24.460 --> 56:27.460
I do love the way that
man leaves a room...

56:31.020 --> 56:32.850
What will you do with the business?

56:32.900 --> 56:35.100
Well, I'll try and run it.

56:35.380 --> 56:38.530
There's been a McAteer at
Billingsgate for 150 years,

56:38.580 --> 56:40.810
I can... I can do a couple more.

56:40.860 --> 56:43.370
Let's talk about money later, though.

56:43.420 --> 56:44.890
Yeah, yeah.

56:44.940 --> 56:46.900
Or you could help me.

56:48.260 --> 56:50.810
You and me.

56:50.860 --> 56:52.300
Together.

57:02.220 --> 57:04.340
Too late for us, Tommy.

57:58.540 --> 58:02.100
I want to be a pathologist,
Nikki, but I have to go home.

58:05.180 --> 58:07.530
It's not your job. And
this is not our fight.

58:07.580 --> 58:11.210
Maybe our being here is another
reason for them to kill.

58:11.260 --> 58:12.930
Tell me, where are they?

58:12.980 --> 58:15.730
Nikki!
