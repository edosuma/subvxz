WEBVTT

00:01.251 --> 00:04.003
- Previously on The Originals...
- When the spell is over, you got

00:04.046 --> 00:06.981
to get away from each other, and
you have to stay away from Hope.

00:06.982 --> 00:08.050
Take away the memories.
Compel me.

00:08.092 --> 00:10.678
The promise of always
and forever. Forget it.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.680
If the Mikaelsons
come together,

00:12.721 --> 00:13.681
it will signal darkness

00:13.722 --> 00:15.182
like we've never known.

00:15.224 --> 00:16.558
Hope Mikaelson
will be our downfall.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.185
I don't blame you for forgetting.

00:18.227 --> 00:20.062
It was a long time ago.

00:20.104 --> 00:22.523
Germany, 1933.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.776
My beloved.

00:25.818 --> 00:27.277
I and my friends

00:27.319 --> 00:30.406
have taken your sweet Hayley.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.949
I'm responsible
for her being taken.

00:31.991 --> 00:33.742
What are you doing here?
Protecting my family.

00:33.784 --> 00:34.785
Elijah.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:45.129 --> 00:46.422
No!

00:59.768 --> 01:00.936
Hope!

01:03.313 --> 01:04.355
Mom?

01:04.397 --> 01:06.442
Hope.

01:06.483 --> 01:07.568
Mom?

01:07.609 --> 01:08.861
I'm here.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.487
What happened?
Where is she?

01:10.529 --> 01:12.906
Breathe.
You're safe now.

01:12.948 --> 01:14.450
Where is my mom?

01:22.833 --> 01:24.293
What?

01:25.878 --> 01:27.796
She's gone.

01:27.838 --> 01:31.383
No, no.
No, no.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.594
No, no.

01:33.635 --> 01:36.013
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no...

01:37.181 --> 01:39.433
No. No...

01:39.475 --> 01:44.480
No...

02:24.102 --> 02:25.896
Dear Klaus,

02:25.937 --> 02:29.232
you and I are no strangers
to heartbreak,

02:29.274 --> 02:33.904
and yet, each loss hits more
deeply than the one before.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.906
I've had to return
to my daughters,

02:35.947 --> 02:38.700
as I'm sure you can understand.

02:38.742 --> 02:41.203
Please know I am
a phone call away

02:41.244 --> 02:42.454
if you need a friend.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.664
With all my sorrow,

02:44.706 --> 02:48.001
and with love for you
and your family,

02:48.043 --> 02:50.128
Caroline.

02:57.719 --> 03:00.055
This was my fault.

03:00.097 --> 03:03.350
I'm the one who
let Greta get away.

03:03.392 --> 03:06.895
You can't beat yourself up
over this, Josh.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.564
Greta's plan was
already in motion.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.025
You didn't start the fire,
you just got burnt by the flame,

03:12.067 --> 03:14.319
like everybody else.
Yeah, well, still,

03:14.361 --> 03:15.862
I can't believe
this was our people

03:15.904 --> 03:17.197
who did this to Hayley.

03:17.239 --> 03:19.074
Those are not our people, all right?

03:19.116 --> 03:22.244
They are a cancer that
needs to be wiped out.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.703
That can wait till tomorrow.

03:23.745 --> 03:27.624
Today is about grieving.

03:27.666 --> 03:29.876
I set up a truce between
all four of the factions.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.962
This afternoon,
we have the second line,

03:32.003 --> 03:34.631
and then, this evening,
we have our werewolf funeral.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.842
And Klaus?

03:36.883 --> 03:39.970
Don't mean to be
the doomsday prophet,

03:40.011 --> 03:42.973
but if he's in the city,
with Hope,

03:43.014 --> 03:44.599
he brings all that chaos
back with him.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.601
No, no, he'll do the right thing
for New Orleans

03:46.643 --> 03:48.270
and his daughter.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.230
Well, for all of our sakes,
I certainly hope so.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.525
To Hayley.

03:53.567 --> 03:55.569
May she sleep with the angels.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.404
And I'm sure she'll teach 'em
a thing or two.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.948
The plane will be there
to pick you up in half an hour.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.325
We'll be ready.

04:43.366 --> 04:44.868
Did you find a witch to help

04:44.910 --> 04:46.661
with our geographical
predicament?

04:46.703 --> 04:49.080
I cannot miss the second line.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.416
Vincent asked Ivy to do it.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.502
Ivy hates me.

04:53.543 --> 04:56.171
Well, all the witches hate you,

04:56.213 --> 04:58.548
but they liked Hayley,

04:58.590 --> 05:01.259
and they know that
Hope needs you today.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.678
Well, astral projection
is tricky magic.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.763
This had better work.

05:04.804 --> 05:06.306
It'll work.

05:06.348 --> 05:08.350
You'll be there
in the only way that you can.

05:08.391 --> 05:09.935
I should never have
agreed to this.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.686
I should be there beside her,
holding her hand.

05:11.728 --> 05:13.230
I know.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.440
But the consequences
of you two being together

05:15.482 --> 05:17.275
have been escalating.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.903
We can't bring that kind
of danger into the city.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.488
This is her mother's funeral.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.573
I should let the city burn.

05:23.615 --> 05:26.201
I'm sick and tired...

05:26.243 --> 05:28.787
What's wrong?

05:32.082 --> 05:33.583
If this houseplant
gasping for life

05:33.625 --> 05:35.043
is any indication,

05:35.085 --> 05:38.255
there's another Mikaelson
in New Orleans.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.840
That can't be right.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.467
Kol and Rebekah know
to stay away

05:42.509 --> 05:43.802
and Hope is with me.

05:47.097 --> 05:50.600
Elijah.

06:00.944 --> 06:03.113
You must be Antoinette.

06:03.154 --> 06:04.656
It is an honor to meet you.

06:06.908 --> 06:09.202
Thank you for inviting us.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.870
Honored to meet you, Elijah.

06:10.912 --> 06:14.374
You slayed a hybrid.
You're a hero here.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.293
And you are?

06:16.334 --> 06:19.296
Emmett.
Thanks for coming.

06:19.337 --> 06:22.007
We wanted to make sure Greta
was properly celebrated.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.926
Sorry for the location.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.970
They took our daylight rings.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.430
Which is fine, because,

06:28.471 --> 06:31.433
you know, she always said

06:31.474 --> 06:33.226
the purest path was
the simplest path.

06:33.268 --> 06:34.769
Well, it's fine by me.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.564
Should we expect your brother?

06:37.606 --> 06:40.358
Roman knows that he's not
welcome in the city

06:40.400 --> 06:43.695
after the part he played
in my mother's plan.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.781
He'll be staying away.
Well,

06:46.823 --> 06:48.617
come meet everyone.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.243
We're all friends
of your mother's

06:50.285 --> 06:52.037
and followers of your
father's doctrine.

06:54.706 --> 06:57.709
My father's views were extreme,

06:57.751 --> 06:59.294
to say the least.

06:59.336 --> 07:01.880
Extreme at a time when lines
needed to be drawn.

07:01.921 --> 07:04.674
Like now.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.427
Your mother was
the first to show us

07:07.469 --> 07:09.512
this city had lost its way.

07:09.554 --> 07:12.849
It's time for vampires
to reclaim our place

07:12.891 --> 07:15.435
as the apex predator,
and rid the community

07:15.477 --> 07:17.437
of its abominations.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.397
I appreciate your commitment,

07:19.439 --> 07:22.359
but it hasn't been a movement
in almost a century.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.656
And with good reason.

07:27.697 --> 07:30.742
I'm not sure what you mean.

07:30.784 --> 07:34.120
It's not just a movement.

07:34.162 --> 07:36.206
It is an army.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.460
This is an army?

07:43.588 --> 07:45.882
Well...

07:45.924 --> 07:47.384
you're early.

08:16.956 --> 08:20.418
Well, that was very, very weird.

08:20.459 --> 08:24.588
Yeah. Your mother made
quite the impression.

08:24.630 --> 08:27.049
We haven't talked about it.

08:28.884 --> 08:31.137
It's the elephant
in the room. My...

08:31.178 --> 08:33.764
my mother's the bad guy in this,

08:33.806 --> 08:35.433
and I know that.

08:35.474 --> 08:37.226
I'm so sorry.
Listen to me.

08:37.268 --> 08:39.437
Your family was in trouble.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.605
I'd do anything for you.
You know that.

08:41.647 --> 08:43.232
I-I do, but my mother
and my brother

08:43.274 --> 08:44.734
got Hayley Marshall killed.

08:44.775 --> 08:46.527
Stop saying that, please.

08:46.569 --> 08:48.738
Well, she meant
something to you,

08:48.779 --> 08:50.281
and I don't want to
pretend that she didn't.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.372
Remove them from my city.

09:06.964 --> 09:08.841
I thought you'd be
meeting with Klaus by now.

09:08.883 --> 09:11.385
Yeah, he can wait five minutes.

09:11.427 --> 09:13.262
Drink this.
No.

09:14.764 --> 09:16.182
I've had plenty.

09:16.223 --> 09:19.310
Yeah, well, I've got news.
No news.

09:19.351 --> 09:22.688
No. Today is all about

09:22.730 --> 09:25.107
reflecting on the loss
of a vibrant woman.

09:25.149 --> 09:28.068
No news, because
news means information,

09:28.110 --> 09:29.528
information means action

09:29.570 --> 09:31.197
and action means dead people.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.448
I don't want any news.

09:36.827 --> 09:38.788
Hit me.

09:38.829 --> 09:42.291
All this dark magic that happens

09:42.333 --> 09:44.919
when that family is together
has been nagging at me.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.255
Blood rain, serpents,
maggots, and now I hear

09:48.297 --> 09:49.590
there's hail
at the edge of town.

09:49.632 --> 09:51.550
Please do not tell me
that the end is nigh.

09:51.592 --> 09:52.593
I don't want to hear that today.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.512
Nothing biblical,

09:54.553 --> 09:56.639
but there is something in
some of the old teachings

09:56.680 --> 09:58.432
from the Ancestors
that I remembered.

10:01.894 --> 10:05.981
It's a grimoire of a
powerful seer from 1718

10:06.023 --> 10:07.566
who prophesied the destruction

10:07.608 --> 10:11.654
of this city's
supernatural communities.

10:11.695 --> 10:13.280
Here.

10:13.322 --> 10:17.076
"And thou shall know the signs
of blood from water,

10:17.117 --> 10:19.411
"vipers from the rivers,
larvae from the soil,

10:19.453 --> 10:21.080
ice rain from
the skies..."

10:21.121 --> 10:23.332
Let me see that.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.129
It gets worse.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.438
Shh. It's okay.

10:48.607 --> 10:50.818
Where are we?

10:52.903 --> 10:56.824
Um, just outside the city.

10:56.866 --> 10:59.076
Why is my head on fire?

10:59.118 --> 11:02.246
Klaus' hybrids shot you up
with vervain.

11:02.288 --> 11:03.539
Not you?

11:10.212 --> 11:13.966
We were foolish to go there.

11:16.135 --> 11:18.470
I wanted my mother's friends
to have a chance

11:18.512 --> 11:23.058
to pay their respects, but...
we should have stayed away.

11:26.770 --> 11:29.481
I understand
his anger towards me, I just...

11:29.523 --> 11:32.318
This game, whatever it is
that he's playing here...

11:32.359 --> 11:37.156
I don't think it's a game.

11:48.292 --> 11:51.253
No.

11:51.295 --> 11:53.631
Oh, no, no.

11:59.970 --> 12:01.639
What the hell is wrong with you?

12:01.680 --> 12:03.390
Hope's burying her mother
here today.

12:03.432 --> 12:05.392
Elijah had to go.
I did the city a favor.

12:05.434 --> 12:08.187
By inflaming Greta's vampires?
She's already their martyr.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.855
What do you think they're gonna
do when they find out

12:09.897 --> 12:12.232
you've murdered her daughter?
Let them come.

12:12.274 --> 12:14.360
I'm in the mood for a fight.

12:17.029 --> 12:19.114
Yes.

12:19.156 --> 12:21.158
Elijah says he wants to talk to you.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.993
Put him on.

12:26.288 --> 12:28.165
What did you do?

12:28.207 --> 12:30.626
That's a question you should be
asking yourself, isn't it?

12:30.668 --> 12:32.795
Her family was in danger.

12:32.836 --> 12:34.630
And what a hero
you turned out to be.

12:34.672 --> 12:36.507
This is revenge.

12:36.548 --> 12:39.343
You force me to watch her die
just to show me how it feels.

12:39.385 --> 12:41.053
Actually, on a day filled
with sorrow,

12:41.095 --> 12:42.554
I'm taking great pleasure

12:42.596 --> 12:44.348
in knowing
how terribly she'll suffer.

12:44.390 --> 12:45.808
You listen to me, okay?

12:45.849 --> 12:48.060
Anything happens to her,

12:48.102 --> 12:49.979
I will never forgive this.

12:50.020 --> 12:52.106
One doesn't need forgiveness
from enemies.

12:52.147 --> 12:54.066
And that's where we are,
you and I.

12:54.108 --> 12:56.110
We're certainly
no longer family.

12:56.151 --> 12:57.695
I want to make a deal.

12:57.736 --> 13:00.447
Nothing you have
is of interest to me.

13:00.489 --> 13:02.157
What if you could have me back?

13:02.199 --> 13:05.285
You've made your choice
on that matter perfectly clear.

13:05.327 --> 13:06.912
No, no, no, no.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.497
My memory.

13:08.539 --> 13:10.708
No! No!

13:10.749 --> 13:12.418
No, Elijah.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.255
Marcel Gerard
and Vincent Griffith

13:16.296 --> 13:18.090
cast the spell to take it away.

13:18.132 --> 13:20.134
My guess is
they can bring it back.

13:23.721 --> 13:26.098
You would do that for her?

13:26.140 --> 13:27.766
Without hesitation.

13:30.686 --> 13:32.604
Your offer is rejected.

14:04.826 --> 14:05.910
What are you doing?

14:05.952 --> 14:06.995
This is exactly what you wanted.

14:07.036 --> 14:08.037
You can get your brother back.

14:08.079 --> 14:09.747
My brother's dead to me.

14:09.789 --> 14:11.291
Oh, come on. You say that,
but you don't mean that.

14:11.332 --> 14:13.209
Enough! He let Hayley die.

14:13.251 --> 14:16.254
I could have saved her,
but he stopped me.

14:16.296 --> 14:18.339
You didn't see her face, Marcel.
She looked right at him.

14:18.381 --> 14:21.175
She thought Elijah was there
for her, but he wasn't.

14:21.217 --> 14:23.720
And he didn't.

14:23.761 --> 14:26.180
And now, she's dead.

14:29.434 --> 14:31.144
Hope will be landing soon.

14:31.185 --> 14:32.520
I need to be gone.

14:36.566 --> 14:38.693
You didn't even ask me.

14:38.735 --> 14:40.695
I'm not gonna lose you.

14:42.030 --> 14:44.240
The irony.

14:44.282 --> 14:46.242
My mother did all these heinous things

14:46.284 --> 14:49.829
because of some deluded ideology

14:49.871 --> 14:53.041
that vampires need to be pure.

14:53.082 --> 14:54.834
And now the only thing
that will save me

14:54.876 --> 14:57.837
is the blood of the very
creature she despised.

14:57.879 --> 15:01.215
Maybe this is God's way of

15:01.257 --> 15:06.012
punishing our family,
or my father's stupid legacy.

15:07.847 --> 15:09.015
Maybe I deserve this.

15:09.057 --> 15:10.433
Antoinette, please.

15:10.475 --> 15:13.394
Stop it. We got to fight this.

15:16.022 --> 15:18.775
And what happens when
your memories have returned?

15:20.818 --> 15:22.153
You'll have your family back.

15:23.529 --> 15:25.698
You'll remember why you cared.

15:28.117 --> 15:30.078
The seven years we've spent
together is no match

15:30.119 --> 15:33.039
for a thousand years
of loving them...

15:36.501 --> 15:38.836
and all the years
you spent loving her.

15:38.878 --> 15:41.297
What are you even
suggesting here?

15:43.424 --> 15:45.635
I will never stop loving you.

15:45.676 --> 15:48.012
I just...

15:50.181 --> 15:52.308
I don't want this to end.

16:00.024 --> 16:01.484
Hey.

16:01.526 --> 16:03.444
Hey.

16:05.446 --> 16:08.032
You are gonna live. Okay?

16:08.074 --> 16:11.369
And I'm gonna find another way
to get that cure.

16:13.830 --> 16:15.456
From a jail cell?

16:17.500 --> 16:19.419
From a jail cell with this.

16:22.046 --> 16:23.965
Okay?

16:25.883 --> 16:27.260
So he called you?

16:27.301 --> 16:29.095
Yeah, he wants to make a deal.

16:29.137 --> 16:30.513
We get him the cure for Klaus' bite,

16:30.555 --> 16:31.848
he'll take his memories back.

16:31.889 --> 16:33.516
And how does this help us?

16:33.558 --> 16:35.351
He'll go back to France,

16:35.393 --> 16:37.437
and he'll take Greta's
nightwalker Nazis with him.

16:37.478 --> 16:40.148
Once he has his memories back,
he's not gonna want to leave.

16:40.189 --> 16:42.150
No, no, no. He knows he can't
be here. I told him

16:42.191 --> 16:43.526
the consequences
of the Mikaelsons

16:43.568 --> 16:46.028
sharing the same space.
He gets it.

16:46.070 --> 16:47.613
If we thought he could
stay away from Klaus,

16:47.655 --> 16:49.824
then why did we take
his memories in the first place?

16:49.866 --> 16:51.617
I think it's gonna be
a long time

16:51.659 --> 16:54.495
before Elijah and Klaus find
their way back to each other.

17:00.501 --> 17:02.003
You have the cure?

17:02.044 --> 17:04.005
I got a small collection
of Klaus's blood saved up

17:04.046 --> 17:05.756
for a rainy day,
and given the circumstances,

17:05.798 --> 17:06.965
I'd say it's pouring.

17:07.008 --> 17:09.260
What happens if we don't use it?

17:09.301 --> 17:11.262
Greta's vampires are bragging

17:11.304 --> 17:13.598
that they've got an Original
on their team.

17:13.638 --> 17:15.183
Now, we let his girlfriend die,
we've pretty much

17:15.223 --> 17:16.684
radicalized him ourselves.

17:18.769 --> 17:20.229
Whatever we decide
to do, Marcel,

17:20.271 --> 17:21.897
Elijah can't stay
in New Orleans.

17:21.939 --> 17:23.398
All right? We can't have
multiple Mikaelsons

17:23.441 --> 17:24.775
running around here, period.

17:24.817 --> 17:26.402
Because if you think

17:26.444 --> 17:28.320
a blood rain is bad,
wait until you hear

17:28.362 --> 17:30.406
what the witches say
is gonna come next.

17:47.465 --> 17:48.508
Where's Dad?

17:48.549 --> 17:50.551
He'll be here soon.

17:50.593 --> 17:53.304
He's just waiting on Ivy to help
him with the astral projection.

17:54.639 --> 17:57.391
Everyone else?

17:59.936 --> 18:01.646
Marcel should be here.

18:01.687 --> 18:04.357
Vincent.

18:04.398 --> 18:05.900
There's Josh.

18:09.153 --> 18:12.823
What about Declan?

18:16.410 --> 18:18.663
Please tell me
someone told Declan.

18:18.704 --> 18:20.373
He's in Ireland.

18:20.414 --> 18:21.749
I-I was so focused
on everyone else...

18:21.791 --> 18:23.376
Oh, my God, Freya.

18:23.417 --> 18:25.127
I'll fix it.

18:43.437 --> 18:44.438
You're late.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.565
By five minutes.

18:45.606 --> 18:46.732
I don't want to hear excuses.

18:46.774 --> 18:47.984
My daughter's waiting for me.

18:48.025 --> 18:49.026
Watch your tone.

18:49.068 --> 18:51.320
I'm doing you a favor.

18:53.739 --> 18:55.741
Remember, if you touch her,
she'll just feel

18:55.783 --> 18:58.411
an ugly chill, so I'd avoid
any sort of physical comfort.

19:00.788 --> 19:02.790
And how do I know this
isn't some secret vengeance

19:02.832 --> 19:04.208
you and the covens are plotting

19:04.250 --> 19:05.459
against me?

19:05.501 --> 19:07.920
No witch would ever
mess with a man

19:07.962 --> 19:10.131
on the day that he buries
his daughter's mother.

19:21.100 --> 19:22.310
Give me your hands.

19:24.895 --> 19:27.273
Just be sure
you don't transport me

19:27.315 --> 19:29.108
to the bottom
of the Mississippi. Hmm?

19:29.150 --> 19:31.360
I'll do my best.

19:37.825 --> 19:40.703
Voye á sa fille.

19:46.709 --> 19:48.669
This is all wrong.

19:48.711 --> 19:51.756
She didn't even know
all these people.

19:51.797 --> 19:54.717
Your mom made a
mark on this city.

19:54.759 --> 19:57.219
Everyone's here to honor her.

19:57.261 --> 19:58.929
But where are
all of her friends?

20:03.684 --> 20:04.810
Marcel, where are you?

20:04.852 --> 20:06.312
I'm with Vincent.

20:06.354 --> 20:07.521
There's something
we got to take care of.

20:07.563 --> 20:09.106
Cover for us.
Cover for you?

20:09.148 --> 20:10.900
What the hell are you doing?

20:12.902 --> 20:16.405
This is all wrong.

20:27.416 --> 20:30.002
Voye á sa fille.
Voye á sa fille.

20:30.044 --> 20:33.130
Voye á sa fille.
Voye á sa fille.

20:33.172 --> 20:34.340
Voye á sa fille...

20:34.382 --> 20:35.466
What's the delay?

20:35.508 --> 20:38.135
It's magic, not pay-per-view.

20:40.179 --> 20:43.265
Voye á sa fille.
Voye á sa fille.

21:03.244 --> 21:04.245
Josh!

21:05.496 --> 21:06.789
Freya!

21:06.831 --> 21:07.998
Klaus!

21:10.209 --> 21:11.460
Emmett.

21:11.502 --> 21:13.254
What the hell
are you doing here?

21:13.295 --> 21:15.339
Where are Antoinette and Elijah?

21:15.381 --> 21:16.549
Probably under a rock somewhere.

21:16.590 --> 21:17.633
Maybe you should join them.

21:21.303 --> 21:24.306
We're not going anywhere till
they're returned to us safely.

21:27.309 --> 21:29.311
I need to be there.
You can't.

21:29.353 --> 21:31.647
There is a big difference
between "can't" and "shouldn't."

21:31.689 --> 21:32.732
I need to protect my daughter.

21:34.859 --> 21:36.360
I'm sorry,
but I can't let you go.

21:44.412 --> 21:46.247
We've got to get out of here.
No.

21:46.289 --> 21:48.249
Hope. I said no. This
already sucks enough.

21:48.291 --> 21:49.709
Look, I'm not gonna
let them ruin it more.

21:52.003 --> 21:54.797
Bruciare supe terram,
faciendo...

21:54.839 --> 21:57.049
Hope!
Ignis ga praemium.

22:02.930 --> 22:04.932
Weapons up.

22:04.974 --> 22:07.018
Bruciare supe...
Josh!

22:07.059 --> 22:10.104
Faciendo ignis ga...

22:10.146 --> 22:13.524
She's gone. Let's
get out of here.

22:15.651 --> 22:19.405
I'm gonna break
every bone in your body.

22:19.447 --> 22:21.866
I'm sorry, but there are things
you don't know yet.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.034
She's in danger!

22:23.075 --> 22:24.660
She's in more danger if you go.

22:24.702 --> 22:26.162
I don't care about the plagues.

22:26.204 --> 22:28.080
Let molten lava
rain from the sky!

22:28.122 --> 22:31.042
You'll care about this.

22:37.381 --> 22:39.509
Read this.

22:39.550 --> 22:41.677
"And thou shall know the signs
of blood from water,

22:41.719 --> 22:43.679
"vipers from the rivers,
larvae from the soil,

22:43.721 --> 22:45.223
ice rain from the skies..."

22:45.264 --> 22:49.435
"Fire across the water,
monsoons from the sea."

22:54.941 --> 22:57.693
"The death of all firstborns."

23:00.947 --> 23:04.116
What happens if they don't come?

23:04.158 --> 23:05.660
They'll come.

23:05.701 --> 23:08.538
But if they don't...

23:10.998 --> 23:13.584
I want to be cremated.

23:13.626 --> 23:15.211
My ashes...
They will come.

23:15.253 --> 23:17.088
That little pond in Manosque,

23:17.129 --> 23:19.173
near the bakery,
would be a nice place.

23:19.215 --> 23:21.717
You are not going to die.

23:21.759 --> 23:25.137
Okay?

23:25.179 --> 23:26.889
So confident.

23:30.852 --> 23:32.895
And with good reason.

23:45.366 --> 23:46.701
Did you bring it?

23:49.328 --> 23:51.706
Vincent Griffith, I presume?

23:51.747 --> 23:54.166
In the flesh.

23:54.208 --> 23:55.459
Ready to do this?

23:55.501 --> 23:58.421
Yeah. Heal her first.

23:58.462 --> 23:59.672
No, that's not gonna happen.

24:00.923 --> 24:02.550
As soon as it's over.

24:02.592 --> 24:04.051
No, I need your word
you are going to heal her.

24:04.093 --> 24:06.053
When it's done, I promise.

24:06.095 --> 24:08.806
We're all in danger.

24:08.848 --> 24:11.726
Freya, me,

24:11.767 --> 24:14.395
and every firstborn that
calls this city home.

24:14.437 --> 24:17.899
Hope.

24:17.940 --> 24:21.027
Bottom line, every moment
your family spends together

24:21.068 --> 24:23.112
takes us one step
closer to our deaths

24:23.154 --> 24:26.908
and as you can see, there isn't
much more left until the end.

24:29.118 --> 24:31.871
I'm sorry.

24:36.250 --> 24:38.169
Get me back there.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.963
Send me to my daughter.

24:43.633 --> 24:45.885
Voye á sa fille.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.434
Hope.

24:53.476 --> 24:56.562
Go away.

24:56.604 --> 24:59.357
There's no magic
that can fix this.

24:59.398 --> 25:01.067
I said leave.

25:01.108 --> 25:02.109
Please don't push me away.

25:02.151 --> 25:04.278
You deserted me.

25:05.529 --> 25:07.073
You left me all by myself

25:07.114 --> 25:09.033
when you promised me
that you would be there.

25:09.075 --> 25:10.743
I wanted to be there.

25:12.828 --> 25:14.664
I only just found out
how dangerous this is.

25:14.705 --> 25:15.831
I could kill you.

25:15.873 --> 25:16.999
Then let me die!

25:22.088 --> 25:24.632
My mom is dead.

25:24.674 --> 25:26.467
She's dead.

25:26.509 --> 25:28.010
And it's my fault.

25:28.052 --> 25:30.680
And I need more than some
half version of you.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.396
I can't do this.

25:38.437 --> 25:40.231
Dad, I can't do this anymore.

25:40.272 --> 25:41.899
I can't live like this.

25:41.941 --> 25:44.402
I don't want
to live like this anymore.

25:44.443 --> 25:47.238
P... Please don't say that.

25:47.279 --> 25:49.573
You need to go.

25:51.367 --> 25:54.370
Just go.

26:03.129 --> 26:05.881
Are you okay?

26:39.668 --> 26:42.337
I should've been there for you

26:42.379 --> 26:43.964
and for Hope.

26:45.674 --> 26:48.635
But...

26:48.677 --> 26:52.013
I was scared...

26:52.055 --> 26:53.473
of this very moment.

26:57.686 --> 27:00.647
This family, hmm?

27:02.816 --> 27:04.359
We're a curse to each other

27:04.401 --> 27:06.653
and to our home.

27:06.695 --> 27:09.447
And I know...

27:09.489 --> 27:10.824
she needs me.

27:10.865 --> 27:12.242
I see that now.

27:12.284 --> 27:16.204
But loving her brings her
closer to death.

27:20.834 --> 27:24.671
And I want her to live.

27:24.713 --> 27:28.174
I want her to grow up.

27:28.216 --> 27:32.554
I want her to love...

27:32.596 --> 27:37.851
and be as strong
and beautiful a woman...

27:37.892 --> 27:41.062
as her mother.

27:48.737 --> 27:52.574
I don't know what to do.

27:55.619 --> 27:58.872
And I really wish that
you were here to tell me...

28:05.170 --> 28:07.088
Little wolf.

28:14.137 --> 28:16.681
Are you ready?

28:18.725 --> 28:21.353
I am.

28:29.319 --> 28:32.989
Louvri animo,
Pémét pou accessum.

28:33.031 --> 28:35.909
Louvri animo,
Pémét pou accessum.

28:37.827 --> 28:41.539
Louvri animo, Pémét
pou accessum.

28:50.340 --> 28:52.133
The promise
"always and forever,"

28:52.175 --> 28:55.053
it anchored you, filled you,

28:55.095 --> 28:58.765
grounded you
for a thousand years.

28:58.807 --> 29:01.434
Remember that love.

29:01.476 --> 29:03.770
The bond.

29:11.152 --> 29:14.155
Open the red door.

29:14.197 --> 29:16.991
Let it all back in.

29:34.843 --> 29:38.888
What you did to me,
you set my course!

29:38.930 --> 29:41.558
No.

29:41.599 --> 29:44.853
I can't.

29:44.894 --> 29:46.312
I can't.

29:50.942 --> 29:52.861
Let it all back in.

30:03.538 --> 30:06.332
You knew that
your secret betrayal

30:06.374 --> 30:10.295
was the cause of everything
I became!

30:10.336 --> 30:11.546
No!

30:11.588 --> 30:13.214
No!

30:13.256 --> 30:14.382
What is happening?

30:14.424 --> 30:15.592
He's remembering.

30:15.633 --> 30:17.761
No. No.

30:17.802 --> 30:18.970
You're hurting him.

30:20.805 --> 30:21.931
Marcel, we can't stop now, man.

30:21.973 --> 30:23.141
You got to keep going.

30:24.392 --> 30:25.977
Remember the bond.

30:27.312 --> 30:28.980
Always and forever.

30:47.081 --> 30:50.502
Elijah, stop.

30:50.543 --> 30:52.837
Stop!

30:52.879 --> 30:54.255
Remember your family.

30:54.297 --> 30:56.257
Remember Hayley.

30:56.299 --> 30:57.801
Please, don't do this.
Please, don't do this.

30:57.842 --> 30:59.844
Please!

31:09.479 --> 31:10.855
What the hell
just happened?

31:15.944 --> 31:18.696
I looked into the prophecy

31:18.738 --> 31:21.574
and as far as I can tell,
it's real.

31:21.616 --> 31:25.328
Every moment
our family spends together

31:25.370 --> 31:27.372
leads us one step closer
to our deaths.

31:27.413 --> 31:30.542
The decision we made
to take the power from her

31:30.583 --> 31:32.377
was to save her life.

31:32.418 --> 31:35.463
I had no idea it would ruin her
in this way.

31:37.590 --> 31:42.679
She's in her room, searching
for a spell that doesn't exist

31:42.720 --> 31:45.181
to fix a problem
that can't be solved.

31:45.223 --> 31:48.935
I feel like I can't do anything
right today.

31:48.977 --> 31:51.271
Just... feel so...

31:51.312 --> 31:53.773
Powerless.

31:55.817 --> 31:57.610
Listen, um...

31:57.652 --> 32:00.530
we're going to be heading
to the bayou in a few minutes.

32:00.572 --> 32:02.615
Are you...
I'll be gone.

32:02.657 --> 32:05.326
I'll check in from the road.

32:05.368 --> 32:08.246
Klaus, there's something
you should know.

32:08.288 --> 32:11.833
Marcel and Vincent decided
to take Elijah up on his offer.

32:11.875 --> 32:13.585
They what?

32:13.626 --> 32:15.044
And I don't disagree.

32:15.086 --> 32:16.588
All of this happened

32:16.629 --> 32:18.172
because Elijah doesn't know
who he is.

32:18.214 --> 32:20.758
Well, that's the point.
He doesn't know.

32:20.800 --> 32:22.844
He doesn't have any idea
of the damage he's wrought.

32:22.886 --> 32:24.137
If he finds out,
it'll destroy him.

32:26.222 --> 32:28.558
Either way, we've lost him.

32:29.893 --> 32:32.937
I was trying to save him
from himself.

32:36.316 --> 32:37.692
I'm so sorry.

32:37.734 --> 32:41.195
Um... but it's too late.

32:45.074 --> 32:46.409
Good-bye, Freya.

33:30.789 --> 33:32.374
What have you done to him?

33:32.416 --> 33:34.084
Why isn't he waking up?

33:34.126 --> 33:35.711
This didn't have
anything to do with us.

33:35.752 --> 33:37.713
This... there's some dark magic
on the body.

33:37.754 --> 33:39.465
It's like his mind
isn't even in there.

33:39.506 --> 33:41.842
What do you mean? Like
someone took him? Yeah.

33:41.884 --> 33:44.011
Who? VINCENT: We could ask
you that same question.

33:44.052 --> 33:46.722
It ain't like your mama ain't
have access to witches, right?

33:46.763 --> 33:48.223
My mother is dead.

33:48.265 --> 33:50.976
Yeah, but her minions live on.

33:51.018 --> 33:53.395
I had nothing to do with this.

33:53.437 --> 33:55.397
All right, fair enough.

33:55.439 --> 33:56.982
But you better hope
that he wakes up

33:57.024 --> 33:59.318
in time to clear your name
and to get you this.

33:59.359 --> 34:01.528
I could be dead by then.

34:01.570 --> 34:03.906
Yeah, that sounds like
a personal problem.

34:03.947 --> 34:05.449
You hate me

34:05.491 --> 34:06.909
and you don't even know me.

34:06.950 --> 34:08.368
We know all we need to know.

34:08.409 --> 34:09.786
Your mother infected this city

34:09.828 --> 34:11.413
with her backward thinking.

34:11.455 --> 34:13.706
She came for my family
and she murdered my friend.

34:13.748 --> 34:15.792
If Elijah doesn't wake up
in time,

34:15.833 --> 34:18.795
just consider yourself another
one of Greta's innocent victims.

34:18.837 --> 34:20.505
Open.

34:37.063 --> 34:40.650
Moze li la paix.

34:40.692 --> 34:43.027
Moze li la paix.

34:44.655 --> 34:46.949
Moze li la paix.

34:48.033 --> 34:50.369
Moze li la paix.

35:02.214 --> 35:05.717
I know how much that you've lost
over all these years

35:05.759 --> 35:07.511
trying to get our family
back together.

35:07.553 --> 35:10.180
And...

35:10.222 --> 35:11.640
I know that you think

35:11.682 --> 35:13.600
that there's nothing else
that we can do.

35:15.352 --> 35:16.687
But I believe that there is.

35:21.441 --> 35:22.818
There has to be.

35:22.859 --> 35:24.570
We have to save each other.

35:24.611 --> 35:26.530
We have to save
always and forever.

35:30.117 --> 35:33.203
You've taught me most of what
I know about magic, and...

35:34.955 --> 35:36.373
if you're up for it,

35:36.415 --> 35:40.252
I'd really like your help
figuring it out.

35:44.631 --> 35:46.883
Anything you need.

35:52.139 --> 35:55.559
Do you think that I could, um...

35:55.601 --> 35:57.477
Yeah.

35:57.519 --> 35:58.687
Absolutely.

36:25.172 --> 36:26.131
Freya.

36:32.262 --> 36:33.930
Keelin.

36:36.975 --> 36:40.062
Oh. Oh...

36:41.063 --> 36:42.731
How did you...

36:42.773 --> 36:44.691
I got on a plane as soon
as I heard the news.

36:53.784 --> 36:58.955
People will forget
the things you said,

36:58.997 --> 37:01.917
forget the things you did,

37:01.958 --> 37:06.046
but no one ever forgets
the way you made them feel.

37:08.799 --> 37:10.676
Hayley Marshall...

37:10.717 --> 37:13.720
made me feel like
I was part of a family.

37:15.472 --> 37:16.807
And when the realities

37:16.848 --> 37:19.434
of this life became
too much to bear,

37:19.476 --> 37:21.603
we shouldered them together.

37:21.645 --> 37:24.064
We laughed,

37:24.106 --> 37:25.482
we cried.

37:25.524 --> 37:28.026
When I failed,

37:28.068 --> 37:30.028
she lifted me up.

37:30.070 --> 37:32.948
And when I succeeded,

37:32.989 --> 37:34.950
she danced by my side.

37:38.620 --> 37:40.914
And she did that for all of us.

37:43.917 --> 37:47.379
No one will ever be able
to replace her,

37:47.421 --> 37:49.381
or heal the pain

37:49.423 --> 37:51.425
we feel at her loss.

37:51.466 --> 37:53.427
But we can honor her

37:53.468 --> 37:55.262
with our actions

37:55.303 --> 37:57.431
and with our words...

37:58.807 --> 38:00.934
We can love each other...

38:02.602 --> 38:04.980
The way she would've
wanted us to love.

38:22.080 --> 38:24.332
Good-bye, Mom.

38:43.310 --> 38:45.812
What are you doing?
You can't be here.

38:45.854 --> 38:47.230
Yes, I can.

38:47.272 --> 38:48.690
Just for a moment.

38:50.233 --> 38:52.611
Our family has infinite
struggles ahead,

38:52.652 --> 38:55.489
but right now,
I need to be here...

38:55.530 --> 38:57.115
with my daughter.

39:07.626 --> 39:09.920
Things are probably
gonna get ugly.

39:11.880 --> 39:13.173
Let's pack it in, everyone.

39:13.215 --> 39:14.883
Take shelter.

39:32.567 --> 39:35.821
I'll always be here for you.

39:35.862 --> 39:38.365
Even if I can't truly be
by your side,

39:38.406 --> 39:39.783
holding your hand,

39:39.825 --> 39:42.577
I'll call and I'll write.

39:42.619 --> 39:45.580
And Freya will allow us some
time together with her magic.

39:46.915 --> 39:48.750
But you have to know,

39:48.792 --> 39:51.628
this is the last time
we can do this.

39:54.047 --> 39:55.549
Come here, sweetheart.

40:04.015 --> 40:07.644
I'm gonna fix this for us.

40:09.020 --> 40:10.689
I hope that you do.

40:13.650 --> 40:15.193
We shouldn't let the fire
reach land.

40:15.235 --> 40:16.903
You should go.

40:16.945 --> 40:18.321
Just one more minute.

40:24.411 --> 40:25.662
I love you.

40:25.704 --> 40:28.832
I love you, too.

41:02.532 --> 41:04.242
It's no use.

41:11.041 --> 41:13.543
You stay away from me.

41:13.585 --> 41:15.253
Oh, believe me, I'm not here

41:15.295 --> 41:17.047
'cause I enjoy
the pleasure of your company.

41:25.472 --> 41:27.432
There's no way out.

41:29.309 --> 41:30.894
We're trapped.
