WEBVTT

00:06.845 --> 00:09.313
It's not fair.
I don't want to!

00:09.348 --> 00:12.016
Molly, you're old enough
to know that life isn't fair.

00:12.050 --> 00:13.651
I'm six.

00:13.685 --> 00:15.486
That's right.
You're my big, brave girl.

00:15.521 --> 00:18.189
And Mommy needs your help.
Don't you love Mommy?

00:18.223 --> 00:19.657
We're just gonna play
make-believe.

00:19.691 --> 00:22.293
Like when we said
that Grandma set that fire

00:22.327 --> 00:24.929
so that she could go live with
those other nice old people.

00:24.963 --> 00:26.063
I miss Grandma.

00:26.098 --> 00:28.065
It's just for
a couple of hours.

00:28.100 --> 00:30.501
You'll wait in the well,
Mommy will call the police,

00:30.536 --> 00:33.171
they'll rescue you,
and then we'll be on TV!

00:36.408 --> 00:41.479
Okay, okay, we're gonna
get money and presents.

00:41.513 --> 00:45.783
Now, when the police arrive,
you have to say

00:45.818 --> 00:47.385
that you ran off
by yourself

00:47.419 --> 00:49.587
and that I came
looking for you.

00:56.395 --> 00:58.696
Okay... here we go.

00:58.730 --> 01:01.766
No, no! It's dark
and it smells.

01:01.800 --> 01:03.234
Don't be a baby.

01:03.268 --> 01:04.602
I don't want to.

01:04.635 --> 01:07.104
It's fine, it's fine.

01:07.139 --> 01:08.940
I'll do it.
I'll show you.

01:16.648 --> 01:19.217
Doesn't this look fun?

01:20.152 --> 01:22.253
You're gonna love this.

01:22.287 --> 01:24.088
It's exciting. See?

01:24.122 --> 01:27.391
It's fun in here!

01:31.597 --> 01:33.931
There's lots of pennies!

01:44.576 --> 01:46.644
What did you do?!

01:48.981 --> 01:51.582
Help! Help!

01:51.617 --> 01:53.150
Help!

01:53.185 --> 01:54.619
Help!

01:54.653 --> 01:56.020
You little brat!

01:56.054 --> 01:58.990
Help!

02:05.797 --> 02:07.064
Why didn't you wake me?

02:07.099 --> 02:08.900
Why? 'Cause I didn't
want to wake

02:08.934 --> 02:11.335
that big, brilliant,
beautiful brain of yours.

02:11.370 --> 02:13.204
I doubt you would find

02:13.238 --> 02:15.606
a brain oozing cerebrospinal
fluid attractive.

02:15.641 --> 02:16.219
Oh!

02:16.244 --> 02:17.308
You came home
late last night.

02:17.309 --> 02:19.911
Yeah, well, you know what?
I got a lot to review here

02:19.945 --> 02:21.812
before I testify
in front of the subcommittee.

02:21.847 --> 02:23.314
You see all this stuff?

02:23.348 --> 02:26.250
You have two more weeks, Booth.
You should take a break.

02:26.285 --> 02:27.852
I want to.

02:27.886 --> 02:30.221
You know, Sweets wants
to take on more responsibility,

02:30.255 --> 02:32.423
take some of this
workload off of me.

02:32.457 --> 02:34.725
You want Sweets
to lead a murder investigation?

02:34.760 --> 02:37.061
Well, he's earned it, right?
Without Sweets,

02:37.095 --> 02:39.497
we would never have caught the
kid who killed the chess player.

02:39.531 --> 02:42.300
While I agree with that,
<i>you</i> are my partner.

02:42.334 --> 02:44.602
I'll still be around.

02:44.636 --> 02:46.504
And I can call you any time?

02:46.538 --> 02:48.439
That means all the time, right?

02:50.375 --> 02:52.009
Brennan.

02:52.044 --> 02:53.210
Yes?

02:53.245 --> 02:55.346
Okay.
Yes, thank you.

02:55.380 --> 02:57.882
We'll see how he does.
Remains were found in a well

02:57.916 --> 02:59.817
outside of Ellicott City.
Tell Sweets to meet there.

02:59.851 --> 03:02.653
I can drop you off
if you want.

03:02.688 --> 03:05.156
You study. If Sweets is
incompetent, I'll let you know.

03:06.058 --> 03:07.458
Yeah.

03:07.492 --> 03:09.360
I'm sure you will.

03:24.776 --> 03:27.945
Please place any tissue floating
on the water in evidence bags.

03:27.980 --> 03:30.081
You can check for particulates
back at the lab.

03:30.115 --> 03:32.555
Yeah, this isn't our first
rodeo, there, Dr. Saroyan.

03:32.584 --> 03:34.585
You're equating
this victim

03:34.619 --> 03:37.321
with animals mistreated
at a rodeo. Quite clever.

03:37.356 --> 03:39.523
No, but... Okay.

03:39.558 --> 03:43.160
So, Cam, I'm sending up
tissue and pupal casings.

03:43.195 --> 03:44.762
And bone fragments
that were dislodged

03:44.796 --> 03:46.230
when rats fed on him.

03:46.264 --> 03:48.466
Him?

03:48.500 --> 03:50.101
Yes, the size
of the femoral head

03:50.135 --> 03:51.669
indicates a male.

03:51.703 --> 03:53.637
Second instar larvae from
blowflies and flesh flies.

03:53.672 --> 03:56.607
Time of death
is five days prior.

03:56.641 --> 04:00.111
No marked lipping
on the symphyseal dorsal margin

04:00.145 --> 04:02.913
places him in his early 40s.

04:02.948 --> 04:04.915
Guys, the area blocked off

04:04.950 --> 04:06.650
by crime scene tape
is too localized.

04:06.685 --> 04:08.719
I want it increased
by 50 meters. And anyone

04:08.754 --> 04:10.554
not wearing booties
is gonna be written up.

04:10.589 --> 04:11.822
Including you.

04:11.857 --> 04:13.958
Good morning to you,
Dr. Sweets.

04:13.992 --> 04:15.626
Booties?

04:15.660 --> 04:16.761
Yeah, well,
it's regulation.

04:16.795 --> 04:18.329
I gotta do everything
by the book.

04:18.363 --> 04:19.697
I can't let Booth down.

04:19.731 --> 04:22.065
Is that Sweets?

04:22.100 --> 04:24.235
Yes, it is. And he looks

04:24.269 --> 04:25.569
mighty dashing
in his booties.

04:25.604 --> 04:26.737
Thank you.

04:26.772 --> 04:28.739
Hey, got a new sheriff in town.

04:28.774 --> 04:30.941
Dr. Sweets,
please make sure that

04:30.976 --> 04:34.045
Dr. Saroyan has the support
that she needs.

04:34.079 --> 04:37.615
She's in charge of the scene,
and sometimes

04:37.649 --> 04:41.352
the FBI techs can be sloppy
handling evidence.

04:41.386 --> 04:43.487
Regulations can be a bitch,
can't they?

04:43.522 --> 04:46.590
I think your man over there's
not wearing proper gloves.

04:46.625 --> 04:48.025
Who? Which man?

04:48.060 --> 04:50.294
Hey!

04:50.328 --> 04:53.397
Ooh, bones...
where the surface made contact

04:53.432 --> 04:57.835
with the bottom of the well,
it's encrusted with coins.

04:57.869 --> 05:00.471
Yeah, the well was drilled into
the limestone.

05:00.505 --> 05:02.773
So there was
an electrochemical reaction

05:02.808 --> 05:05.476
that fused the coins
to the bone.

05:05.510 --> 05:07.150
These will be difficult
to remove

05:07.179 --> 05:08.813
without damaging the bones.
Ooh.

05:08.847 --> 05:12.850
The tissue
on the femur, Cam.

05:12.884 --> 05:17.254
According to the locals, this
area hosts family picnics by day

05:17.289 --> 05:19.356
and underage drinking by night.
Your booties.

05:19.391 --> 05:21.258
Booties.

05:21.293 --> 05:24.962
How considerate. So how do you
even know this is a murder?

05:24.996 --> 05:27.098
The deceased could've been
sitting on the edge,

05:27.132 --> 05:29.433
fallen in after
drinking too much.

05:29.468 --> 05:31.836
A test? Okay.
Well, there are drag marks

05:31.870 --> 05:34.472
that go all the way
from the trail all the way over

05:34.506 --> 05:36.107
to the well here.
And if you look at the grate,

05:36.141 --> 05:39.110
it shows signs of stress,
as if someone stomped it in.

05:39.144 --> 05:41.212
This is a body dump,
Dr. Saroyan.

05:41.246 --> 05:43.514
Okay. I'm impressed.

05:43.548 --> 05:45.649
Wow, did he just
"Brennan" you?

05:45.684 --> 05:47.451
I believe he did.

05:47.486 --> 05:49.286
What does it mean
to "Brennan" someone?

05:49.321 --> 05:50.654
Is that a compliment?

05:50.689 --> 05:52.590
Dr. Sweets seems
to be very thorough.

05:52.624 --> 05:54.458
Thank you.

♪

06:32.289 --> 06:34.849
There are numerous fractures
on the remains.

06:34.850 --> 06:37.321
I can't distinguish peri
from postmortem damage

06:37.322 --> 06:39.256
until all the metals
have been removed.

06:39.291 --> 06:41.192
And between the victim's
hair and the tissue,

06:41.226 --> 06:43.327
I should be able
to run a tox screen.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.696
Greater and lesser humeral
tubercles are enlarged.

06:45.731 --> 06:47.932
You know, somebody could've
tossed this guy in

06:47.966 --> 06:49.967
knowing that the coins
and other metals

06:50.001 --> 06:52.236
would obscure the evidence
on the bone.

06:53.371 --> 06:55.306
Nah, could be knowledge
of predation,

06:55.340 --> 06:56.574
or maybe...

06:56.608 --> 06:58.576
Ms. Warren.
Yeah?

06:58.610 --> 06:59.810
Brennan doesn't speculate.

06:59.845 --> 07:01.212
We observe,

07:01.246 --> 07:02.747
we analyze, we use facts.

07:02.781 --> 07:04.715
As an intern, you should
know this already.

07:04.750 --> 07:06.784
Yeah, but my instincts
are highly developed.

07:06.818 --> 07:09.320
It'd be a crime
not to put that in the mix.

07:09.354 --> 07:11.455
Look, I appreciate that
Ms. Warren's here to learn,

07:11.490 --> 07:13.924
but perhaps a novice isn't the
best choice in this situation.

07:13.959 --> 07:16.127
You really didn't have
to accompany the remains

07:16.161 --> 07:17.695
to the Jeffersonian,
Dr. Sweets.

07:17.729 --> 07:19.630
Though we appreciate
your thoroughness.

07:19.664 --> 07:23.134
Well, no, Booth would know
if I wasn't following protocol.

07:23.168 --> 07:24.468
You're making this about you.

07:24.503 --> 07:26.036
What about this guy, huh?

07:26.071 --> 07:28.773
I was actually talking
to Dr. Saroyan just then.

07:28.807 --> 07:30.775
You know, when someone is

07:30.809 --> 07:33.844
as uptight as you, usually they
have something bubbling inside.

07:33.879 --> 07:37.214
I wouldn't try to shrink
the shrink, Warren.

07:37.249 --> 07:38.349
The remains, Ms. Warren.

07:38.383 --> 07:41.118
Okay. But I'm thinking

07:41.153 --> 07:42.753
That's it.
One more word that isn't

07:42.788 --> 07:44.021
specifically related
to the case,

07:44.055 --> 07:45.923
and I will dismiss you,
Ms. Warren.

07:45.957 --> 07:47.625
Thank you.
There you go.

07:47.659 --> 07:50.528
There's your paperwork.
Chain of custody is complete.

07:50.562 --> 07:52.630
I believe regulations state
that's all you need.

07:52.664 --> 07:54.532
Um, maybe I should...

07:54.566 --> 07:55.866
Regulations, Dr. Sweets.

07:55.901 --> 07:58.602
Bye-bye for now.

08:04.409 --> 08:07.812
I find I am fond of Sweets
in this new role.

08:07.846 --> 08:09.613
His attention to detail
is impressive.

08:09.648 --> 08:13.751
The heads of both femurs
are also enlarged.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.619
I think the victim
was an athlete.

08:15.654 --> 08:17.021
Just a vibe.

08:18.190 --> 08:20.658
A vibe is not evidence.
Right.

08:20.692 --> 08:23.761
Okay, then.
No remodeled fractures.

08:23.795 --> 08:28.332
Increased irregularity in both
the coracoid processes.

08:28.366 --> 08:29.867
So there was strain
to his shoulders

08:29.901 --> 08:31.402
from overdeveloped muscles.

08:31.436 --> 08:33.571
Most commonly found
in swimmers.

08:33.605 --> 08:35.339
Like I said, an athlete.

08:36.274 --> 08:37.908
Off the physical evidence,

08:37.943 --> 08:40.077
I'm willing to confirm
the possibility

08:40.111 --> 08:42.513
the victim was a swimmer.

08:42.547 --> 08:45.149
And it all started with a vibe.

08:51.890 --> 08:53.791
The report on the
transfer of the remains

08:53.825 --> 08:55.693
to the Jeffersonian.
This is just about the transfer?

08:55.727 --> 08:58.095
Yeah, it's protocol.
You're not gonna read it?

08:58.129 --> 08:59.730
Okay, there's a whole
section in there

08:59.764 --> 09:01.465
on the new intern.
I'm not a fan.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.234
I know. Cam told me.
I don't care.

09:03.268 --> 09:05.903
I tell you what, take a look
at the crime scene photos here.

09:05.937 --> 09:08.105
Do your shrinky thing and see
if you see anything, huh?

09:08.139 --> 09:09.440
I was there.
I don't need the photos.

09:09.474 --> 09:11.008
All right, well,
tell me what you know.

09:11.042 --> 09:13.043
Okay. Well, the grate
was stomped out.

09:13.078 --> 09:14.712
The location of the dump
was methodical.

09:14.746 --> 09:16.881
The killer was deliberate
and thoughtful...

09:16.915 --> 09:18.983
So not a crime of passion?

09:19.017 --> 09:20.684
Perhaps initially.
But after the act,

09:20.719 --> 09:22.620
whoever did this seems
to accept what he's done.

09:22.654 --> 09:23.921
No regrets.

09:23.955 --> 09:25.756
Oh.

09:26.992 --> 09:28.959
I got a hit off Missing Persons.

09:28.994 --> 09:31.362
The victim is Brian Thomas, 43.

09:31.396 --> 09:35.799
He's the head swim coach at Knox
Community College in Maryland.

09:35.834 --> 09:38.469
He was reported missing
by his wife.

09:38.503 --> 09:39.837
I sent it all to your inbox.

09:39.871 --> 09:41.071
Great. Thanks, Angela.
All right,

09:41.106 --> 09:42.740
I tell you what.
You talk to the wife.

09:42.774 --> 09:43.974
See if we're dealing with

09:44.009 --> 09:45.743
a grieving widow
or a potential suspect,

09:45.777 --> 09:47.044
all right?
Need those photos?

09:47.078 --> 09:48.145
I don't need the pictures.

09:48.179 --> 09:49.546
I was there.

09:49.581 --> 09:51.115
Are you sure?

09:51.149 --> 09:52.549
We are.

09:52.584 --> 09:54.952
I'm very sorry
for your loss, Mrs. Thomas.

09:54.986 --> 09:56.887
Can you think of anyone

09:56.922 --> 09:58.756
who might have wanted
to hurt your husband?

09:58.790 --> 09:59.890
No.

09:59.925 --> 10:02.092
His life was devoted
to his work.

10:02.127 --> 10:04.828
All he did
was coach and swim.

10:04.863 --> 10:07.097
Did he compete?
Someone could've been jealous.

10:07.132 --> 10:09.867
He hadn't competed in years.
Mm.

10:09.901 --> 10:12.836
What time did your husband

10:12.871 --> 10:15.139
leave the house
the day he went missing?

10:15.173 --> 10:17.875
Why is that important?

10:17.909 --> 10:20.110
You don't know, do you?

10:20.145 --> 10:21.578
I'm a nurse.

10:21.613 --> 10:24.048
I work mostly nightshifts.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.749
And Brian would
usually stay at the pool

10:25.784 --> 10:27.584
late to work out.

10:27.619 --> 10:31.088
We hadn't spent a lot
of time together lately.

10:31.122 --> 10:33.924
That must've taken a toll
on your marriage.

10:33.959 --> 10:38.095
We had talked about
taking the summer off to travel.

10:38.129 --> 10:39.730
Just the two of us.

10:39.764 --> 10:42.533
Make up for
lost time.

10:44.035 --> 10:47.004
We could've made it work.

10:52.844 --> 10:54.878
Is this gonna
take long, Curly?

10:54.913 --> 10:56.246
Nicknames and a highly
competitive nature.

10:56.281 --> 10:58.148
I'm gonna go out
on a limb and say

10:58.183 --> 10:59.817
you grew up
with a bunch of boys.

10:59.851 --> 11:01.185
Good call. Five
older brothers.

11:01.219 --> 11:04.121
Whoa, hey, hey, hey!
This is hydrochloric acid.

11:04.155 --> 11:05.389
I don't know about this.

11:05.423 --> 11:06.623
I don't want my bones damaged.

11:06.624 --> 11:08.726
Your bones will be fine.

11:08.760 --> 11:10.527
I'm diluting it down
to a one-molar solution.

11:10.562 --> 11:13.330
So, it'll remove
the carbonate material,

11:13.365 --> 11:15.032
and I can pry off the coins.

11:15.066 --> 11:16.133
Oh.

11:16.167 --> 11:17.534
Everyone here is so smart.

11:17.569 --> 11:19.036
I don't understand

11:19.070 --> 11:20.237
why there's not
more appreciation

11:20.271 --> 11:21.872
for scientific imagination.

11:21.906 --> 11:24.008
Science fiction?
Try the H.G. Wells exhibit

11:24.042 --> 11:25.542
on the fourth floor.

11:25.577 --> 11:27.778
Every new discovery started
with a dream, dude.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.080
Including you diluting the HCL.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.083
Nice work.
Right?

11:33.118 --> 11:34.651
All right.

11:34.686 --> 11:36.920
Let me know when I can start
de-fleshing the bones

11:36.955 --> 11:38.355
and getting rid of the staining.

11:38.390 --> 11:40.024
Yeah, good luck with that.

11:40.058 --> 11:41.558
Thanks. Any idea

11:41.593 --> 11:44.228
where I could get
about 80 pounds of pineapples?

11:47.999 --> 11:49.080
So, Cam didn't get anything

11:49.100 --> 11:50.601
from the tox screens, all right?

11:50.635 --> 11:53.003
There is no poisons or drugs
in the victim's system.

11:53.038 --> 11:55.072
She should've called me. You're
busy prepping for your hearing.

11:55.106 --> 11:57.007
Ah, you know, force of habit.

11:57.042 --> 11:59.476
I looked into the victim's work
at the community college.

11:59.511 --> 12:01.745
Oh, hazing.
Yeah.

12:01.780 --> 12:03.180
The reporter cites
an anonymous source

12:03.214 --> 12:05.516
who told her about hazing
on the swim team

12:05.550 --> 12:06.917
orchestrated by one
of its members,

12:06.951 --> 12:08.585
Avery Parrish.
He made them

12:08.620 --> 12:10.721
drink dangerous amounts
of milk and vinegar

12:10.755 --> 12:12.623
until they vomited?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:12.657 --> 12:14.058
Two of the students
were hospitalized.

12:14.092 --> 12:16.160
One of them quit the team.

12:16.194 --> 12:17.661
That's horrible.
Why-why-why would this kid

12:17.695 --> 12:19.196
turn against Brian?

12:19.230 --> 12:21.065
Well, I tracked down
the student reporter

12:21.099 --> 12:24.134
who confirmed that the informant
was Brian Thomas,

12:24.169 --> 12:25.369
the swim coach.

12:25.403 --> 12:27.504
So much for the source
being anonymous.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.206
I told her
if she withheld the name,

12:29.240 --> 12:30.874
she'd be impeding
a federal investigation. So...

12:30.909 --> 12:33.043
Look at you, huh?
Okay, I'll tell you what,

12:33.078 --> 12:34.411
I'll go with you,
we'll go talk to him.

12:34.446 --> 12:36.180
No, no. It's my lead,
Agent Booth.

12:36.214 --> 12:38.348
You got a lot of studying to do.
You're gonna be on C-SPAN.

12:38.383 --> 12:40.664
Yeah, that's heavy.
Okay, listen, uh, take Bones with you.

12:40.685 --> 12:41.522
I don't need a babysitter.

12:41.547 --> 12:43.253
I'm not saying that
you need a babysitter,

12:43.254 --> 12:45.055
I'm just saying--
look, you're doing a great job.

12:45.090 --> 12:48.258
You really are. Just take Bones
so she can do her Boney thing.

12:48.293 --> 12:50.294
Right. No, I knew that.

13:00.672 --> 13:04.208
Since acting as an agent,
you're finally using evidence

13:04.242 --> 13:06.210
to reach conclusions--
I appreciate that.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.887
As opposed to my usual
meaningless psychobabble?

13:08.912 --> 13:09.613
Exactly.

13:09.614 --> 13:12.950
Okay. Well, I wish I could say
I appreciate your new intern.

13:12.984 --> 13:14.751
Oh, Ms. Warren
is in Mensa.

13:14.786 --> 13:17.621
She graduated at the top
of her class from Michigan State at 19.

13:17.655 --> 13:18.494
She has a lot to offer.

13:18.495 --> 13:20.343
But you said that
you were gonna fire her.

13:21.126 --> 13:24.294
Well, she needs discipline,
but we both need her expertise.

13:24.329 --> 13:27.197
I'm surprised you're not
more accepting, Dr. Sweets.

13:27.232 --> 13:28.499
Well...

13:28.533 --> 13:30.467
That's Avery Parrish.

13:30.502 --> 13:31.502
Avery Parrish?

13:31.536 --> 13:32.970
- Yeah?
- FBI.

13:33.004 --> 13:35.506
We need to talk to you
about Brian Thomas.

13:35.540 --> 13:37.040
Oh, my God,
what's happened to him?

13:37.075 --> 13:39.543
He hasn't been at practice all week.
Wait, who?

13:39.577 --> 13:40.944
Our coach.

13:40.979 --> 13:43.046
His remains were found
at the bottom of a well.

13:43.081 --> 13:45.682
Most of his flesh
had been consumed by rats.

13:45.717 --> 13:47.217
Did she say "bats"?

13:47.252 --> 13:48.819
Are you kidding, Quentin?

13:48.853 --> 13:51.188
I imagine he has
temporary hearing loss

13:51.222 --> 13:52.890
from excessive
exposure to water.

13:52.924 --> 13:55.292
You should see
an otolaryngologist.

13:55.326 --> 13:57.261
You're good.
And you

13:57.295 --> 13:58.495
should see an orthopedist.

13:58.530 --> 14:00.364
Based on your
asymmetrical posture,

14:00.398 --> 14:02.399
caused by limited mobility

14:02.433 --> 14:04.401
in your right glenohumeral
joint, you seem to have

14:04.435 --> 14:07.037
a musculoskeletal condition
known as "swimmer's shoulder."

14:07.071 --> 14:08.505
So Coach Brian
turned you in

14:08.540 --> 14:11.041
for hazing-- you must have
been upset about that.

14:11.075 --> 14:13.177
And you think...?

14:14.179 --> 14:15.479
Hey, no way.

14:15.513 --> 14:17.414
No matter what he did,
I loved the guy.

14:17.448 --> 14:19.416
Because of him, Quentin
and I are looking

14:19.450 --> 14:22.152
at scholarships to four-year colleges.
When I got out of the Army,

14:22.187 --> 14:24.121
I thought it was just
community college for me.

14:24.155 --> 14:25.689
We all loved the guy.
Yeah.

14:25.723 --> 14:27.958
When was the last time
any of you saw him?

14:27.992 --> 14:29.693
Last Wednesday night--
practice ended at 8:00,

14:29.727 --> 14:31.195
and we all left.

14:31.229 --> 14:33.697
Coach stayed to lock up
and swim laps, like usual.

14:33.731 --> 14:35.999
I think Coach Gabby
was still here, though.

14:36.034 --> 14:38.502
Oh. Yeah.

14:38.536 --> 14:40.416
- Gabby.
- Although a nonspecific response,

14:40.438 --> 14:42.773
it seemed fraught
with meaning.

14:42.807 --> 14:45.008
I agree.
What are you alluding to?

14:45.043 --> 14:46.543
It seemed like...

14:46.578 --> 14:48.579
they were sleeping together.
You don't know

14:48.613 --> 14:50.581
if they were sleeping together.
Coach loved his wife.

14:50.615 --> 14:53.784
Brian's dead, man.
They need us to tell the truth.

14:53.818 --> 14:56.587
Gabby and Coach were together
all the time.

15:02.170 --> 15:04.148
I wasn't having an affair
with Brian.

15:04.331 --> 15:06.232
We were coworkers
and friends.

15:07.074 --> 15:08.018
My God.

15:08.043 --> 15:10.326
Now, I've had sex with
coworkers and friends.

15:10.845 --> 15:12.512
In the past.

15:12.546 --> 15:14.881
- Why do I care?
- Uh...

15:14.915 --> 15:16.416
maybe what was

15:16.450 --> 15:18.284
a casual affair to him
meant more to you.

15:18.319 --> 15:19.986
You wouldn't be
the first person to kill

15:20.021 --> 15:21.287
because an affair ended.

15:21.322 --> 15:24.758
For the last time,
there was no affair.

15:26.060 --> 15:28.094
At least not with me.

15:28.129 --> 15:30.697
You're saying he was having
an affair with someone else?

15:34.101 --> 15:37.103
A couple of weeks ago,
Brian gave me a ride home...

15:37.138 --> 15:40.740
and I found a woman's earring
in his car.

15:40.775 --> 15:43.710
And he smelled like perfume
a couple of times.

15:43.744 --> 15:45.879
He was married, Ms. Morrell.

15:45.913 --> 15:48.481
I know Lyla.
She didn't wear perfume,

15:48.516 --> 15:50.684
because it irritated
her patients.

15:50.718 --> 15:53.019
And this earring
was gaudy,

15:53.054 --> 15:54.387
with rhinestones and stuff.

15:54.422 --> 15:56.489
Lyla barely wears studs.
You met her, right?

15:56.524 --> 15:58.091
You may think
that this clears you,

15:58.125 --> 15:59.659
but it actually gives you
another motive,

15:59.694 --> 16:01.161
which is jealousy.

16:01.195 --> 16:03.997
I agree.
His reasoning is sound.

16:17.478 --> 16:19.913
It's actually working.
Yeah.

16:19.947 --> 16:21.481
I just had a feeling.

16:21.515 --> 16:22.849
There's an enzyme
in pineapple.

16:22.883 --> 16:24.784
Bromelain.
Yeah.

16:24.819 --> 16:26.386
It breaks down proteins.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.521
I took a Thai cooking course,

16:28.556 --> 16:31.157
and I saw what the pineapples
did to the meat,

16:31.192 --> 16:33.093
and I thought, you know,
why the hell not?

16:33.127 --> 16:34.317
Man, I should've
known this.

16:34.318 --> 16:35.771
Hey, you think it's gonna
remove all the staining?

16:35.796 --> 16:37.530
It is.

16:37.531 --> 16:39.532
And thankfully,

16:39.567 --> 16:41.167
the acidity
didn't degrade the bone.

16:41.202 --> 16:43.069
You risked the
remains by using

16:43.104 --> 16:45.238
a technique you weren't
sure would work?

16:45.272 --> 16:48.308
Yeah. Thanks for all
the pineapples and trusting me.

16:48.342 --> 16:50.477
I'm thinking mai tais
after work.

16:50.511 --> 16:53.213
But I don't trust you. Not now.
It was risky,

16:53.247 --> 16:56.216
but I got to say,
science was on her side.

16:56.250 --> 16:57.784
And Dr. Brennan
will be so stoked

16:57.818 --> 16:59.185
to see all the injuries.

16:59.220 --> 17:01.454
There's a fracture
to the superior portion

17:01.489 --> 17:03.456
of the acetabulum
and another upwards

17:03.491 --> 17:05.358
into the ilium
sustained postmortem

17:05.392 --> 17:07.794
during the fall down the well.
And perimortem injuries

17:07.828 --> 17:09.628
to the left humerus
and to the back

17:09.663 --> 17:11.931
of the left ribs,
numbers nine, ten and 11.

17:11.965 --> 17:14.701
Also, the L3 and L4
are shattered.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.236
That would have
paralyzed the victim.

17:16.270 --> 17:17.470
Oh, totally.

17:17.505 --> 17:19.339
Right now I'm guessing

17:19.373 --> 17:21.111
that he was beaten
while in the fetal position.

17:21.136 --> 17:22.633
I'll swab
the wounds-- maybe there's

17:22.634 --> 17:24.608
some trace that can help us
identify a weapon.

17:25.112 --> 17:29.282
How much do you love
the humble pineapple right now?

17:30.951 --> 17:32.318
<i>All right, so,</i>

17:32.353 --> 17:34.120
I had Forensic
Accounting analyze

17:34.155 --> 17:35.488
the victim's financials.

17:35.523 --> 17:37.791
Did you say "excuse me"?
Because I-I missed that.

17:37.825 --> 17:39.025
I'm studying here.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.527
I didn't want to waste time.

17:40.561 --> 17:42.796
Brian bought dinner
at the same restaurant

17:42.830 --> 17:46.199
every Friday, using
the same credit card.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.768
That's one of the nights his
wife worked at the hospital.

17:48.803 --> 17:50.403
Maybe he <i>was</i>
having an affair.

17:50.437 --> 17:51.597
That's exactly
what I thought.

17:51.605 --> 17:53.506
Where are you going?
You know what?

17:53.541 --> 17:55.175
I'll tell you what,
I need a study break.

17:55.209 --> 17:57.310
I'll take this one, okay?

17:59.547 --> 18:01.281
<i>I just had a feeling</i>

18:01.315 --> 18:03.983
it would work, and now the
lab smells like Hawaii!

18:04.018 --> 18:06.085
You were lucky this
ended well, Ms. Warren.

18:06.120 --> 18:08.888
Oh, luck is the unknown
mixed with knowledge,

18:08.923 --> 18:11.624
instinct, commitment,
imagination and foresight.

18:11.659 --> 18:15.995
I-I mean, I wouldn't call
the discovery of penicillin luck, or...

18:16.030 --> 18:17.764
complex math...
Fine, but as an intern,

18:17.798 --> 18:19.465
before you do anything
like this again,

18:19.500 --> 18:20.733
get my approval.

18:20.768 --> 18:23.303
Lot of red tape
around here.

18:23.337 --> 18:25.271
Uh, did you see
that his calcaneus

18:25.306 --> 18:28.608
was driven backwards, causing
chipping damage to the cuboid?

18:28.642 --> 18:32.145
He was thrown feet-first
down the well.

18:33.380 --> 18:34.848
Oh.
What?

18:34.882 --> 18:36.583
You didn't see this?

18:36.617 --> 18:38.451
A bony enlargement
at the distal end

18:38.485 --> 18:40.753
of the first metatarsal
of the left foot.

18:40.788 --> 18:43.525
It's a hallux abducto
valgus deformity.

18:43.550 --> 18:44.591
Bunions are
usually caused

18:44.592 --> 18:47.160
by ill-fitting shoes.
I also see

18:47.194 --> 18:50.697
a remodeled hairline Lisfranc
fracture in the mid-foot.

18:50.731 --> 18:53.333
About two weeks old.
I should have seen these.

18:53.367 --> 18:55.668
Yes. Perhaps your
vibe is broken.

18:55.703 --> 18:57.971
This injury is the
result of someone

18:58.005 --> 19:00.039
stumbling over a
plantar-flexed foot,

19:00.074 --> 19:02.508
an injury often sustained
by women in high heels.

19:02.543 --> 19:04.143
Snowboarders could
sustain this injury.

19:04.178 --> 19:05.912
There's no evidence
Brian went snowboarding

19:05.946 --> 19:07.814
two weeks prior to his death.

19:07.848 --> 19:10.216
I also found
these osteophytes.

19:10.251 --> 19:12.952
From observation,
not a vibe.

19:12.987 --> 19:14.921
Uh, here on
the anterosuperior edges

19:14.955 --> 19:17.023
of the thoracic vertebrae
one, two and three.

19:17.057 --> 19:20.326
This would indicate a continued
stress to the upper back.

19:20.361 --> 19:23.096
That's not a result of swimming.
Definitely not.

19:23.130 --> 19:25.125
He was clearly involved
in some other form of

19:25.150 --> 19:26.786
strenuous physical activity.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.171
Oh, wow. Bones,
this doesn't make any sense.

19:32.206 --> 19:34.507
I mean, if the victim used
his credit card here

19:34.541 --> 19:36.109
every Friday night, someone
should've recognized him.

19:36.143 --> 19:38.311
Are you sure you should be
out in the field, Booth?

19:38.345 --> 19:40.813
You know what, I cannot look
at another operational manual

19:40.848 --> 19:43.683
or disciplinary report without
shooting it, all right?

19:43.717 --> 19:46.085
Let's just...
let's go to that motel

19:46.120 --> 19:48.121
we saw earlier
around the corner, okay?

19:48.155 --> 19:50.523
Just show the manager
the victim's photo.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.492
If he was having
an affair...

19:52.526 --> 19:55.795
- No.
- No what?

19:55.829 --> 19:56.996
He was going in there.

19:57.031 --> 19:58.064
It makes sense.

19:58.098 --> 20:00.099
What makes sense?
Come on!

20:00.134 --> 20:02.302
It's a club.

20:02.336 --> 20:04.737
♪ Keep it cool

20:04.772 --> 20:06.572
♪ What's the name of the club?

20:32.666 --> 20:34.600
He <i>was</i> wearing high heels!

20:34.635 --> 20:36.903
That's why he had the hallux
abducto valgus deformity

20:36.937 --> 20:38.972
and the Lisfranc fracture.

20:39.006 --> 20:40.406
A-And the osteophytes

20:40.441 --> 20:42.141
on the vertebrae
were caused

20:42.176 --> 20:44.077
by the weight
of fake breasts.

20:44.111 --> 20:46.779
Are you saying that the perfume and
the earrings belonged to <i>him?</i>

20:46.814 --> 20:47.780
Yes.

20:47.815 --> 20:49.015
There.
What?

20:49.049 --> 20:50.616
The mandible and
the zygomatic

20:50.651 --> 20:52.385
are Brian Thomas's.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.287
Wait a second,
he wasn't having an affair.

20:54.321 --> 20:55.788
He was a drag queen.

20:55.823 --> 20:57.090
♪ Out on the floor

20:57.124 --> 20:59.692
Whoa.

20:59.727 --> 21:00.960

21:00.995 --> 21:03.229

I can't believe
Jenny's dead.

21:15.658 --> 21:17.659
Oh. This is awful.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.093
I'm... I'm sorry.

21:19.128 --> 21:21.329
She was a good friend
and a great beauty.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.297
Yes. Excellent
bone structure.

21:23.332 --> 21:26.067
Right. Look,
how long had, uh, he...

21:26.101 --> 21:27.702
she been working with you,

21:27.736 --> 21:29.771
Ms. Childs?
Just call me Destiny, sugar.

21:29.805 --> 21:32.373
About a year.
Uh, Fridays only.

21:32.408 --> 21:34.108
Jenny had a day
job. You know,

21:34.143 --> 21:36.678
not everyone can live off booze,
singles and applause.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.113
You know, G-man,

21:39.148 --> 21:41.449
I could make you
look fabulous.

21:41.483 --> 21:42.450
I'm straight. Thanks.

21:42.484 --> 21:43.818
So was Jenny.

21:43.852 --> 21:45.219
Anthropologically
speaking,

21:45.254 --> 21:46.988
homosexuality
is not a prerequisite

21:47.022 --> 21:48.389
for cross-dressing.

21:48.424 --> 21:50.725
There are Kabuki actors

21:50.759 --> 21:53.061
and certain
Hindu devotees

21:53.095 --> 21:55.263
of Krishna.
It's an expression of personality,

21:55.297 --> 21:56.864
like you wearing your socks.

21:56.899 --> 21:58.900
Okay, look, socks are
a little different than a dress.

21:58.934 --> 22:00.234
Oh, you could get used to it.

22:00.269 --> 22:01.669
Actually, kilts are...
Look, guys,

22:01.704 --> 22:03.671
I don't have any problem
with any of this.

22:03.706 --> 22:05.073
Really. I think
you look very...

22:05.107 --> 22:06.874
pretty
in your dress.

22:06.909 --> 22:08.309
But I prefer pants, okay?

22:08.343 --> 22:10.311
So, did Brian have any enemies
at the bar?

22:10.345 --> 22:11.846
Kimmy Moore.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.414
Kimmy Moore.
She was mad at Jenny

22:13.449 --> 22:16.651
for taking her time slot here.

22:16.685 --> 22:18.753
It was prime, darling.
And Kimmy thought

22:18.787 --> 22:20.855
she could parlay her gig
into something bigger,

22:20.889 --> 22:22.857
like a tour or a TV show, but...

22:22.891 --> 22:24.192
Jenny was simply better.

22:24.226 --> 22:25.526
And Kimmy would've killed
over this?

22:25.561 --> 22:26.828
Let's put
it this way,

22:26.862 --> 22:28.096
she has
the worst characteristics

22:28.130 --> 22:29.397
of both the genders--

22:29.431 --> 22:30.798
she has the aggression of a man

22:30.833 --> 22:32.834
and the temper of a woman.
She also has

22:32.868 --> 22:34.001
very well-developed biceps

22:34.036 --> 22:36.204
and trapezius muscles. She's...

22:36.238 --> 22:39.207
definitely strong enough to
throw a grown man down a well.

22:39.241 --> 22:41.042
She was thrown down a well?

22:41.076 --> 22:44.579
Oh, honey, that's no way for
a queen to take her final bow.

22:46.215 --> 22:47.982
♪ All that I ask

22:48.016 --> 22:51.185
♪ Is that you dance with me

22:51.220 --> 22:53.821
♪ Dance with me, dance with me

22:53.856 --> 22:56.124
♪ Yeah...

22:56.158 --> 22:57.859
Sweets.

22:57.893 --> 22:59.655
Am I being called to
the principal's office?

23:00.195 --> 23:03.564
No. Uh, listen, about
the "novice" remarks earlier,

23:03.599 --> 23:05.333
I just wanted
to apologize.

23:05.367 --> 23:07.468
Accepted.
You can pick me up at 8:00.

23:07.503 --> 23:10.371
I like my steak rare
and my beers thick and cold.

23:10.405 --> 23:13.608
I'm glad you understand.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.910
Doesn't seem you do.

23:15.944 --> 23:17.979
Excuse me? What?

23:18.013 --> 23:20.782
Are we gonna drink
and eat meat or what?

23:20.816 --> 23:22.717
Oh, you were serious about that.

23:22.751 --> 23:25.086
Is that such a weird thing
to do or...

23:25.120 --> 23:28.122
No. It's...

23:29.291 --> 23:30.858
Well, we're colleagues.

23:30.893 --> 23:33.327
Okay.

23:33.362 --> 23:34.896
I was feeling it there
for a minute,

23:34.930 --> 23:37.560
but I guess my Sweets-dar
is way off.

23:37.585 --> 23:38.199
No.

23:38.200 --> 23:41.002
I mean, look, I...
It's not like I don't like you.

23:41.036 --> 23:42.880
I mean, I think you're
very attractive and you're...

23:42.881 --> 23:45.987
Dr. Sweets, this is a lab,
not speed dating.

23:46.008 --> 23:47.600
No, we... Uh, I just needed

23:47.625 --> 23:48.976
to see if there was any new
information about the case.

23:48.977 --> 23:52.213
And apparently I'm irresistible.
It's not his fault.

23:52.247 --> 23:54.982
Then do him a favor and try
to rein it in, Ms. Warren.

23:56.084 --> 23:58.719
You wanted to see me?
Yeah.

23:58.754 --> 24:01.389
Fractures to the third
and fourth metacarpals

24:01.423 --> 24:04.592
on the victim's right hand.
It's known as a "fight bite."

24:04.626 --> 24:07.195
So Brian was punching someone?
Yes.

24:07.229 --> 24:11.132
Nice job, Sweets. The person's
tooth penetrated a joint capsule

24:11.166 --> 24:13.734
in Brian's hand, fracturing
the bone. Remodeling suggests

24:13.769 --> 24:16.537
that the injury happened
two weeks before he died.

24:16.572 --> 24:18.773
At the same time
as the fracture to the foot.

24:18.807 --> 24:20.942
Wasn't that the result
of tripping in high heels?

24:20.976 --> 24:24.412
Oh, so the victim was in drag
during the fight.

24:24.446 --> 24:25.880
Hey.
Right?

24:25.914 --> 24:27.415
Brian must've fought
with someone at the bar.

24:27.449 --> 24:28.850
You know, Booth
is there right now.

24:28.884 --> 24:29.984
I'll go give him a call.

24:30.018 --> 24:31.319
Toodle-oo.

24:34.990 --> 24:37.458
I'm a diva, not a murderer.

24:37.492 --> 24:39.293
Well, there's a first time
for everything, okay?

24:39.328 --> 24:41.395
We know that you were mad
that Jenny took your slot.

24:41.430 --> 24:44.165
Yeah. I called in sick,
and the next thing I know,

24:44.199 --> 24:46.434
this queen is trying
to take my crown.

24:46.468 --> 24:48.603
Ha. All because I got the flu.

24:48.637 --> 24:51.038
We were told it was because
your act wasn't very good.

24:51.073 --> 24:53.975
Destiny is jealous.

24:54.009 --> 24:56.644
My act could play Vegas,
sweetheart.

24:56.678 --> 24:58.279
I need you
to remove your makeup.

24:58.313 --> 24:59.814
What?
Jenny got

24:59.848 --> 25:01.716
into a fight. She punched
someone in the face.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.718
So we need you to
remove your... mask.

25:03.752 --> 25:06.821
Uh, two words, okay?
"Uh" and "uh."

25:06.855 --> 25:09.190
It takes hours to create Kimmy,

25:09.224 --> 25:11.492
and I have a show in 15.
Right, well,

25:11.526 --> 25:14.161
you're a suspect in a murder,
so either you take it off

25:14.196 --> 25:17.064
or we go for a ride downtown.
What's it gonna be?

25:23.572 --> 25:26.474
This fight
you say she was in,

25:26.508 --> 25:28.409
it was about three weeks ago,
wasn't it?

25:28.443 --> 25:30.645
Yes.
It wasn't me.

25:30.679 --> 25:33.114
Jenny came in from
the parking lot between shows.

25:33.148 --> 25:34.882
She had a bloody hand.

25:34.917 --> 25:36.884
Okay. What happened?
I don't know.

25:36.919 --> 25:39.220
All she said was that
the situation had been handled.

25:39.254 --> 25:41.856
She was a tough one.
Ooh, butch queen.

25:41.890 --> 25:44.258
If she and I had been
in a fight, this face

25:44.293 --> 25:46.594
wouldn't still be
so beautiful.

25:46.628 --> 25:48.696
I wish I was back home studying
the operational manual, Bones.

25:48.730 --> 25:52.066
I don't
see anything.

25:52.100 --> 25:54.435
You have the results
of the swabs?

25:54.469 --> 25:56.637
Yeah. I found traces
of a copper-zinc alloy

25:56.672 --> 25:59.440
in the fractures to the L3 and
L4 that were not from the coins.

25:59.474 --> 26:01.142
What's the polyethylene?

26:01.176 --> 26:03.210
It's a common
plastic. I found it

26:03.245 --> 26:05.579
in the damage to the humerus.
Now, the most common use

26:05.614 --> 26:08.849
of copper, zinc and plastic is
in a plumbing pipe.

26:08.884 --> 26:11.953
So this lovely dude-lady was
beaten with a plumbing pipe?

26:11.987 --> 26:13.154
Yep.
Come on.

26:13.188 --> 26:15.189
Hey, um, have either
of you seen Cam?

26:15.223 --> 26:16.590
I saw her in the lounge.

26:16.625 --> 26:19.460
Oh, uh, I've been meaning
to ask you.

26:19.494 --> 26:23.564
Was that a blushing Sweets that
I saw run out of here earlier?

26:23.598 --> 26:25.333
He came to apologize
for being stupid,

26:25.367 --> 26:26.934
so I made him feel more stupid.

26:26.969 --> 26:28.135
Wait a minute. What
is it with Sweets

26:28.170 --> 26:29.837
and the interns?
Whoever it was,

26:29.871 --> 26:31.005
I can make him forget.

26:31.039 --> 26:32.440
So the feeling's mutual.

26:32.474 --> 26:34.875
The proper ones
are always crazy in bed.

26:34.910 --> 26:36.110
Right?
Again?

26:36.144 --> 26:37.545
We were, uh,

26:37.579 --> 26:39.513
talking about the case,
about how it's...

26:39.548 --> 26:42.283
New rule: next person I find
discussing their sex life

26:42.317 --> 26:45.453
instead of the case
cleans my autopsy room.

26:54.496 --> 26:55.930
Dr. Sweets.

26:55.964 --> 26:59.600
Mrs. Thomas,
what are you doing here?

26:59.634 --> 27:02.103
I was looking for you, actually.

27:02.137 --> 27:04.071
Oh, do you have
more information for us?

27:04.106 --> 27:07.675
No. I was hoping
to get some answers from you.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.810
I'm-I'm sorry. There are rules.

27:09.845 --> 27:12.680
I'm not allowed to discuss
an ongoing investigation.

27:12.714 --> 27:14.382
It... I understand that, but...

27:14.416 --> 27:17.485
I just heard about Brian
and about him being Jenny

27:17.519 --> 27:19.120
and...

27:19.154 --> 27:21.389
I...

27:21.423 --> 27:24.492
Right.

27:33.468 --> 27:35.369
Well, as an athlete

27:35.404 --> 27:37.705
and a coach,

27:37.739 --> 27:42.009
Brian was required to adhere
to a very structured lifestyle.

27:42.044 --> 27:45.046
And Jenny provided a sort
of escape, you know,

27:45.080 --> 27:47.148
an uninhibited extension
of Brian,

27:47.182 --> 27:49.550
someone completely free.
I'm sorry.

27:49.584 --> 27:52.386
I'm not making myself clear.

27:52.421 --> 27:54.522
The reasons why
don't matter to me.

27:54.556 --> 27:58.225
What I don't
understand is...

27:58.260 --> 28:00.561
why he didn't tell me.

28:04.699 --> 28:07.435
You know, often people reject

28:07.469 --> 28:09.703
what's odd or foreign to them,

28:09.738 --> 28:13.340
and I'm sure Brian was afraid
he'd lose you.

28:14.409 --> 28:17.344
But I loved him. I would've

28:17.379 --> 28:18.813
accepted him.

28:18.847 --> 28:21.949
If he'd just given
me that chance,

28:21.983 --> 28:24.385
trusted me,

28:24.419 --> 28:29.056
maybe he'd still be alive.

28:34.863 --> 28:38.099
I found footage of the fight
that Brian got into

28:38.133 --> 28:39.733
outside Madame's Apple.

28:39.768 --> 28:41.969
I thought the club didn't
have any security cameras.

28:42.003 --> 28:45.439
They don't. But the convenience
store behind the club does.

28:45.474 --> 28:47.942
And I'm guessing it was pointed
in the right direction.

28:47.976 --> 28:50.411
Look at this.

28:53.148 --> 28:55.082
Ooh,

28:55.117 --> 28:57.318
not very ladylike.

28:58.787 --> 29:00.087
I bet

29:00.122 --> 29:02.556
that's where
he broke his foot.

29:02.591 --> 29:05.459
A plumber.
So based

29:05.494 --> 29:08.496
on this fight, I'm thinking
that guy would want revenge.

29:08.530 --> 29:09.663
So how do we find him?

29:09.698 --> 29:11.632
That's why you have me.

29:11.666 --> 29:14.668
I ran the plate through
the DMV database.

29:15.804 --> 29:18.606
Joe Rizzo.
He looks like

29:18.640 --> 29:21.675
the kind of guy who doesn't like
getting beaten up by a woman.

29:39.394 --> 29:40.494
So I got in a fight.

29:40.495 --> 29:42.163
Ain't you ever been
in a fight before?

29:42.197 --> 29:43.998
Well, you?
Eh, probably not.

29:44.032 --> 29:46.600
You know what I think? I think
you were committing a hate crime

29:46.635 --> 29:48.602
but you were messing
with the wrong person.

29:48.637 --> 29:50.938
You were humiliated,
so you killed her for revenge.

29:50.972 --> 29:54.041
Whoa, whoa. Wait, , wait,
wait, wait. She's dead?

29:54.076 --> 29:56.077
Yeah, Joe. She was found
at the bottom of a well.

29:56.111 --> 29:58.179
And since you're a plumber,
you're now our prime suspect.

29:58.213 --> 30:00.848
So, what, the FBI hates plumbers now?
Our techs

30:00.882 --> 30:05.453
found pipes in your car made of
zinc, copper and polyethylene.

30:05.487 --> 30:07.755
Trace elements of those
were found on our victim

30:07.789 --> 30:10.424
from the weapon used to kill her.
Okay,

30:10.459 --> 30:12.460
wait, wait, wait. Look,
you guys got this all wrong.

30:12.494 --> 30:13.994
I didn't kill Jenny.

30:14.029 --> 30:15.062
You knew her name?

30:15.097 --> 30:16.163
Yeah, of-of course.

30:16.198 --> 30:17.765
I was a regular at the bar.

30:17.799 --> 30:19.467
Every Friday night.

30:19.501 --> 30:21.902
I liked Jenny.

30:21.937 --> 30:23.304
Oh.

30:23.338 --> 30:24.839
"Oh" what?

30:24.873 --> 30:27.041
A plumber can't appreciate
good entertainment?

30:27.075 --> 30:28.576
Why did she attack you, then?

30:28.610 --> 30:31.312
We, uh, had... a thing.

30:31.346 --> 30:33.013
Sexual?

30:33.048 --> 30:34.682
No. Come on. She was a guy.

30:34.716 --> 30:36.317
I don't know.
No, our fight

30:36.351 --> 30:38.452
was about my credit card bill.
Every Friday,

30:38.487 --> 30:40.187
there'd be these weird charges.

30:40.222 --> 30:41.956
And I never, ever used
that card,

30:41.990 --> 30:44.125
but the account info was
on my phone, so...

30:44.159 --> 30:46.727
You figured that Jenny used
your phone at Madame's Apple.

30:46.762 --> 30:50.097
Yeah. She was always very
attentive, you know, touchy.

30:50.132 --> 30:51.665
So I figured she pocketed it,

30:51.700 --> 30:54.068
used the account info
to buy stuff, so...

30:54.102 --> 30:55.836
I asked her about it.

30:55.871 --> 30:58.372
Judging from her reaction,
you didn't ask very nicely,

30:58.407 --> 30:59.807
did you?
No, I...

30:59.841 --> 31:01.409
deserved that beating.

31:01.443 --> 31:02.943
I was impolite.

31:02.978 --> 31:04.211
You were impolite?

31:04.246 --> 31:06.514
I called her a tranny.

31:06.548 --> 31:08.716
And I shoved her.

31:08.750 --> 31:11.118
I shouldn't have done that.

31:11.153 --> 31:13.154
But I was out almost 300 bucks.

31:13.188 --> 31:16.724
And I never did find out
who stole the info, so...

31:18.326 --> 31:19.894
<i>So, I analyzed the pipes</i>

31:19.928 --> 31:21.395
we found in Joe's truck.

31:21.430 --> 31:23.798
Now, they match the copper,
zinc and plastic

31:23.832 --> 31:25.566
we found in the victim's wounds.

31:25.600 --> 31:27.535
So now it is time

31:27.569 --> 31:30.304
for phase two.

31:30.338 --> 31:31.639
What's it made of?

31:31.673 --> 31:34.208
Synthetic bone and skin.

31:34.242 --> 31:37.278
It's filled with minced meat
and gelatin--

31:37.312 --> 31:38.979
cherry flavor, of course.

31:39.014 --> 31:40.181
It's a masterpiece.

31:40.215 --> 31:41.248
I know.

31:41.283 --> 31:42.483
And here comes the fun part.

31:42.517 --> 31:43.851
We get to destroy it.

31:43.885 --> 31:46.654
These are
from the suspect's truck.

31:46.688 --> 31:49.757
So we'll attack the torso
to see if we can re-create

31:49.791 --> 31:51.959
the force profile found
on the damaged bones.

31:51.993 --> 31:55.830
Yep.

31:55.864 --> 31:58.199
Now, this is my kind of science.

31:58.233 --> 31:59.667
Right?

32:08.477 --> 32:10.010
What are you doing?

32:11.112 --> 32:13.447
Uh...

32:13.482 --> 32:15.322
we were just, you know,
re-creating the assault.

32:15.347 --> 32:17.284
While blowing off some steam.

32:17.285 --> 32:19.954
Angela has a computer system
worth over $1 million.

32:19.988 --> 32:21.956
I'm sure she could do
a reconstruction

32:21.990 --> 32:24.024
with far less cleanup.
She was busy.

32:24.059 --> 32:26.160
Something about
a stolen Internet connection.

32:26.194 --> 32:28.829
And, as you know, in the first
48 hours of an investigation,

32:28.864 --> 32:30.731
every minute counts.

32:30.765 --> 32:35.436
We'd better get something
probative from this, guys.

32:37.272 --> 32:40.941
That whole "first 48" thing...
nice.

32:40.976 --> 32:42.476
You're gonna do well.

32:42.511 --> 32:44.945
I know.

32:50.085 --> 32:52.419
I've been reviewing
the IP traffic logs

32:52.454 --> 32:55.155
to find out
how Joe Rizzo's info was taken

32:55.190 --> 32:57.124
from his phone.
These are the logs

32:57.158 --> 32:58.926
from each Friday.
It shouldn't...

32:58.960 --> 33:00.828
take that long.
Okay.

33:00.862 --> 33:04.231
Hey, just a little
word of advice.

33:04.266 --> 33:06.567
Don't pass this one up.

33:06.601 --> 33:09.370
One? Which one?
What are you talking about?

33:09.404 --> 33:10.638
Jessica.

33:10.672 --> 33:12.606
She likes you.

33:12.641 --> 33:13.908
And she's fun.

33:13.942 --> 33:15.576
You could use
a little fun.

33:15.610 --> 33:17.211
I have fun, okay?

33:17.245 --> 33:18.579
I don't...

33:18.613 --> 33:19.914
I'll think about it,

33:19.948 --> 33:21.448
but she seems
a little unpredictable.

33:21.483 --> 33:23.284
That's what fun is.

33:23.318 --> 33:25.252
That's why you
could use some.

33:25.287 --> 33:26.954
Uh-oh.
What?

33:26.988 --> 33:29.056
Madame's Apple

33:29.090 --> 33:30.457
has free Wi-Fi.

33:30.492 --> 33:32.293
Every time Joe logged in,

33:32.327 --> 33:34.795
they accessed
his account information.

33:34.829 --> 33:36.730
Oh.

33:39.568 --> 33:41.368
You'd steal customers'
credit card info

33:41.403 --> 33:42.770
when they used
your Wi-Fi?

33:42.804 --> 33:44.305
I would just charge
small amounts

33:44.339 --> 33:45.773
so most people
wouldn't notice.

33:45.807 --> 33:47.541
And Joe-- he was a big tipper,

33:47.576 --> 33:49.810
so I didn't think
$300 was a big deal.

33:49.844 --> 33:51.145
Well, it was to him.

33:51.179 --> 33:52.880
And it was a big
deal to Jenny, too.

33:52.914 --> 33:54.315
Did she confront
you about it?

33:54.349 --> 33:56.050
No, I wouldn't call it
a confrontation.

33:56.084 --> 33:57.851
We just talked about it.
That's it.

33:57.886 --> 33:59.787
No, that's not it.
Jenny's dead, all right?

33:59.821 --> 34:01.388
And you have a motive.

34:01.423 --> 34:03.724
If she talked, you'd go to jail
for identity theft.

34:03.758 --> 34:05.492
Jenny was a friend.

34:05.527 --> 34:07.828
She reminded me that Madame's
Apple wasn't just a bar.

34:07.862 --> 34:10.130
It was a place where people
could be themselves,

34:10.165 --> 34:12.632
whatever that was.
Me stealing

34:12.667 --> 34:14.034
just put all that in jeopardy.

34:14.069 --> 34:16.170
So you just...
you stopped, just like that?

34:16.204 --> 34:19.373
It was that
or lose what I loved most.

34:19.407 --> 34:21.574
It's rare when someone
can change that easily.

34:22.877 --> 34:25.913
I grew up getting laughed at
and beat on.

34:25.947 --> 34:28.815
When that happens, you learn
how to survive any way you can.

34:28.850 --> 34:30.784
And sometimes
you make the wrong choices.

34:30.819 --> 34:34.420
It might not be easy to change,
but I did, Dr. Sweets.

34:36.257 --> 34:39.560
I guess I'm just one
of the rare ones.

34:41.696 --> 34:44.697
I have the results of the
experiment I ran with Hodgins.

34:44.733 --> 34:46.233
You're not gonna like it.

34:46.266 --> 34:48.768
The copper pipes are not a match
for the force profile.

34:48.803 --> 34:50.737
That's right.
How did you know?

34:50.772 --> 34:52.973
I don't use your method
of guess work.

34:53.007 --> 34:55.175
I'd call it an experiment.

34:55.210 --> 34:57.711
You have great potential,
Ms. Warren,

34:57.746 --> 34:59.613
but there are
many brilliant people

34:59.648 --> 35:02.082
whose lives amount to nothing
because they don't appreciate

35:02.117 --> 35:03.784
the gifts they've been given.

35:03.818 --> 35:05.285
I've heard that one a lot.

35:05.320 --> 35:06.820
Then take it to heart.

35:06.855 --> 35:08.467
I'm constantly
marveling at myself.

35:08.468 --> 35:10.403
You should try it.

35:10.437 --> 35:14.073
You're reexamining the
damage to the L3 and L4?

35:14.107 --> 35:15.474
There's too much
localized fragmentation

35:15.509 --> 35:17.209
to be from a pipe.

35:17.244 --> 35:19.979
We're looking for a weapon
that has a much higher velocity,

35:20.013 --> 35:22.581
that is made of zinc,
copper and plastic.

35:22.616 --> 35:23.949
A bullet has a
higher velocity,

35:23.984 --> 35:25.618
but they don't
contain plastic.

35:25.652 --> 35:27.820
A bullet would cause
cavitation and beveling,

35:27.854 --> 35:29.689
which aren't present.

35:29.723 --> 35:32.992
So, what has the same velocity
as a bullet but isn't a bullet?

35:33.026 --> 35:35.161
It <i>was</i> a bullet!
Wait. You just said that...

35:35.195 --> 35:37.063
Think, Ms. Warren.
What did the victim do

35:37.097 --> 35:38.431
when he wasn't wearing a dress?

35:38.465 --> 35:39.799
He swam.

35:39.833 --> 35:42.935
He <i>was</i> shot!

35:44.071 --> 35:45.738
Brian swam laps
after practice.

35:45.772 --> 35:48.207
And he'd lock up after,
so he'd be alone.

35:48.241 --> 35:49.942
When a bullet is fired
into water,

35:49.976 --> 35:51.510
it slows and deforms enough

35:51.545 --> 35:54.480
to create injuries
that mimic blunt-force trauma.

35:54.514 --> 35:56.148
And a bullet exits

35:56.183 --> 35:59.285
the barrel of a gun at an
average of 900 feet per second.

35:59.319 --> 36:01.287
But after hitting the water,
the bullet's velocity would slow

36:01.321 --> 36:02.888
and stop at a depth
of eight feet.

36:02.923 --> 36:05.458
According to my calculations,
the victim was hit

36:05.492 --> 36:09.228
from approximately
5.5 feet away.

36:09.262 --> 36:10.896
Based on the size
of the injuries,

36:10.931 --> 36:14.467
he was likely shot with a
hollow-point bullet from a .45.

36:14.501 --> 36:15.868
Can you run a simulation,
Angela?

36:15.902 --> 36:18.237
Mm-hmm.
You're in for a treat.

36:18.271 --> 36:20.406
Are you talking about
the case or you?

36:27.447 --> 36:29.548
What about the, uh...

36:29.583 --> 36:31.016
the plastic?

36:31.051 --> 36:33.986
One of the bullets
hit a lane divider.

36:39.092 --> 36:41.227
If he were paralyzed

36:41.261 --> 36:43.496
while in the water,
he would have drowned.

36:43.530 --> 36:46.198
We finally have
cause of death.

36:56.010 --> 36:59.012
So far, we've discovered
a nick in a lane line.

36:59.046 --> 37:01.314
Okay, so the bullet did
take off a chunk of plastic

37:01.349 --> 37:02.983
before hitting
the victim.

37:03.017 --> 37:05.318
- Which confirms our scenario.
- But any bullets

37:05.353 --> 37:07.554
fired would've slowed and sunk.
None have been found.

37:07.588 --> 37:10.590
I would imagine that the killer
dove in and collected them.

37:10.625 --> 37:12.626
Yeah, and, uh, the filters
and the chlorine

37:12.660 --> 37:15.095
in the pool would have washed
away any traces of blood.

37:15.129 --> 37:17.864
But the killer had
to move the body.

37:17.898 --> 37:19.466
There could be trace
somewhere.

37:20.501 --> 37:22.435
Found chipping
in the side wall

37:22.470 --> 37:23.703
five feet down.

37:23.738 --> 37:24.971
There were definitely

37:25.006 --> 37:26.406
shots fired
into the pool.

37:26.440 --> 37:27.707
Well, keep looking.

37:27.742 --> 37:29.976
Maybe you can find a bullet.
Yes, sir.

37:32.813 --> 37:35.048
Cam?

37:35.082 --> 37:39.419
I found traces of blood
in the hamper.

37:39.453 --> 37:40.820
The killer must have used this

37:40.855 --> 37:42.422
to move the body
out of the building.

37:42.456 --> 37:44.324
You know, the other swim coach
is the only other person

37:44.358 --> 37:45.592
with a key to the pool.

37:45.626 --> 37:47.060
And all we have
is her word

37:47.094 --> 37:48.595
that she wasn't sleeping
with the victim.

37:48.629 --> 37:49.963
We should see if she owns a gun.

37:49.997 --> 37:52.232
I was going to suggest that.

37:54.402 --> 37:56.836
Do you own a gun, Ms. Morrell?

37:58.105 --> 37:59.906
I don't like what
you're suggesting.

37:59.940 --> 38:02.275
And I don't like that you're not
answering the question.

38:02.309 --> 38:05.045
I don't have to talk
to you without a lawyer.

38:05.079 --> 38:07.013
It's a simple question,
especially if you're innocent.

38:07.048 --> 38:08.415
The records are easy to check.

38:09.550 --> 38:11.685
Yes.

38:11.719 --> 38:13.586
I do. A .45.

38:13.621 --> 38:15.021
But I never use it.

38:15.056 --> 38:18.291
Only for target practice,
I swear.

38:18.325 --> 38:20.994
Brian was my friend.

38:21.028 --> 38:23.463
<i>What did you find at the pool?</i>

38:23.497 --> 38:25.532
Bullet fragment, and it
definitely hit the lane guide.

38:25.566 --> 38:28.301
It was lodged in the drain.
Impossible.

38:28.335 --> 38:30.437
No, it's very possible.
I found it, and I touched it.

38:30.471 --> 38:32.172
It was there, and now
it's right here.

38:32.206 --> 38:35.008
Then we're going to have
to rethink things, aren't we?

38:37.511 --> 38:40.213
Thank you. Ballistics found
no gunpowder residue

38:40.247 --> 38:41.848
in the barrel of Gabby's gun.

38:41.882 --> 38:43.616
So, it hadn't been
fired recently.

38:43.651 --> 38:45.866
We got it wrong.
You should knock, Ms. Warren.

38:45.867 --> 38:48.379
I'll do it later.
The victim wasn't shot poolside.

38:48.380 --> 38:49.501
How do you know?

38:49.526 --> 38:51.206
Hodgins found a bullet
lodged in the drain.

38:51.278 --> 38:52.911
The pool was ten feet deep.

38:52.946 --> 38:55.481
If the shot was fired
from outside the pool,

38:55.515 --> 38:58.050
the bullet would have
stopped moving at eight feet.

38:58.084 --> 38:59.885
It couldn't have lodged itself
in the drain.

38:59.919 --> 39:01.854
Brilliant, Ms. Warren!

39:01.888 --> 39:03.422
I can't tell you how long
I've been waiting

39:03.456 --> 39:04.723
to hear that.
Okay. Whether or not

39:04.758 --> 39:06.158
the victim was shot inside
or outside

39:06.192 --> 39:07.393
the pool,
what difference does it make?

39:07.427 --> 39:08.694
The difference between

39:08.728 --> 39:09.928
finding the killer or not.

39:09.963 --> 39:11.530
Hey, why did you rush...?

39:11.564 --> 39:13.332
What is going on?
Don't know.

39:13.366 --> 39:14.833
Well...

39:14.868 --> 39:16.835
Excuse me.

39:16.870 --> 39:18.270
Uh, little clarity, please?

39:18.305 --> 39:19.938
I am the lead on the case.

39:19.973 --> 39:21.707
Okay. Uh, what's happening?

39:21.741 --> 39:23.976
No idea at all.

39:28.748 --> 39:30.883
The killer had to be
in the pool.

39:30.917 --> 39:33.018
Okay, how does
that help us?

39:33.053 --> 39:35.621
Water transmits pressure much
more efficiently than air.

39:35.655 --> 39:38.257
So, a gun fired underwater
would be deafening.

39:38.291 --> 39:41.393
There's a slight hairline
fracture on the stapes.

39:41.428 --> 39:43.962
We just solved your case, dude.

39:43.997 --> 39:45.264
Would someone please explain?

39:45.298 --> 39:47.733
The stapes was fractured
by the shots.

39:47.767 --> 39:50.569
Which means that the killer's
hearing would also be affected.

39:50.603 --> 39:54.106
You did just solve it.

39:54.140 --> 39:56.041
You are good.

39:56.076 --> 39:58.977
<i>Your hearing problem--</i>

39:59.012 --> 40:01.914
it's a fractured stapes
caused by shooting underwater.

40:01.948 --> 40:03.349
We got a warrant
for your gun.

40:03.383 --> 40:05.017
The one you left
the military with?

40:05.051 --> 40:06.819
I carry it for self-defense.

40:06.853 --> 40:08.787
It tested positive for chlorine.

40:08.822 --> 40:10.556
Yeah, and you didn't recover
all the slugs.

40:10.590 --> 40:12.391
One was found lodged
in the drain.

40:12.425 --> 40:14.159
Ballistics matched it
to your weapon.

40:19.332 --> 40:21.367
Why?

40:21.401 --> 40:24.570
You left the military,
you were getting an education.

40:24.604 --> 40:26.872
At a community college.

40:26.906 --> 40:28.307
I wanted a four-year school.

40:28.341 --> 40:31.009
I served my country.
I deserved it.

40:31.044 --> 40:32.945
How was Brian preventing you?

40:32.979 --> 40:37.683
I practiced so much,
my grades started to fall.

40:39.519 --> 40:41.987
I copied another guy's midterm.

40:42.021 --> 40:43.555
Brian caught you.

40:43.590 --> 40:45.124
He was going to report me.

40:45.158 --> 40:47.359
I'd never get
into a four-year school.

40:47.394 --> 40:49.661
I-I tried
to make him see my side,

40:49.696 --> 40:52.097
but he said rules are rules.

40:52.132 --> 40:54.533
We argued...

40:54.567 --> 40:57.236
and I shoved him into the pool.

41:01.040 --> 41:04.309
And then I just lost it.

41:04.344 --> 41:07.713
You went in after him
and shot at him underwater,

41:07.747 --> 41:09.381
fracturing your stapes.

41:09.416 --> 41:12.584
I don't even remember
how it all happened.

41:12.619 --> 41:16.255
I-I liked Coach,
I really did.

41:20.860 --> 41:23.862
But I just lost it.

41:43.116 --> 41:45.651
You sure you don't have
any more studying to do?

41:45.685 --> 41:47.219
Well, yeah.

41:47.253 --> 41:48.654
Look, if the subcommittee
doesn't like my answers,

41:48.688 --> 41:49.429
it's just not meant to be.

41:49.430 --> 41:51.642
That's an excellent answer.
You're definitely ready.

41:51.643 --> 41:52.205
I'm ready.

41:52.230 --> 41:54.193
Hey, Sweets was
good, by the way.

41:54.194 --> 41:55.561
Very good.
Oh, wait a second.

41:55.595 --> 41:57.396
What? You want
another partner now?

41:57.430 --> 41:59.665
He wasn't <i>that</i> good,
but he did make me realize

41:59.699 --> 42:01.266
I should never take you
for granted.

42:01.301 --> 42:03.669
So it worked out well
for both of us.

42:03.703 --> 42:05.704
You weren't testing
me, were you, Booth?

42:05.738 --> 42:07.105
What do you mean?

42:07.140 --> 42:08.540
Well, if you do
get this job,

42:08.575 --> 42:10.042
maybe we won't be working
together anymore,

42:10.076 --> 42:12.010
and you wanted to see
how that worked out.

42:12.045 --> 42:14.413
Whoa. Wait a second. Oh, let
me just tell you one thing.

42:14.447 --> 42:16.281
I told Stark, okay,
if you're not with me,

42:16.316 --> 42:17.716
I have no interest in that job.

42:17.750 --> 42:19.218
Another excellent answer.
Right.

42:19.252 --> 42:20.586
Where is Sweets?

42:20.620 --> 42:22.387
I thought we were going
to buy him a drink.

42:22.422 --> 42:24.156
You know what?
He said he had something to do.

42:24.190 --> 42:27.459
My guess is, though, he's just
tired from doing real work.

42:27.494 --> 42:30.963
Manly work, FBI work.

42:52.585 --> 42:54.419
Well, that was a good start.

42:54.454 --> 42:56.522
I think I pulled a muscle.

42:56.556 --> 42:58.857
I'd be disappointed
if you didn't.

43:01.601 --> 43:03.936
Should we go get
that steak and beer now?

43:04.976 --> 43:07.062
I should, uh... I
should clean up first.

43:09.077 --> 43:10.213
Just get a new apartment.
