How would you like
to see your father? Huh?

02:36.712 --> 02:37.736
Come on.

02:37.813 --> 02:40.611
l know they taught you
English before they
shut down the orphanage.

02:40.683 --> 02:42.480
And l speak
lousy Vietnamese.

02:42.551 --> 02:43.745
[laughs]

02:45.721 --> 02:47.916
You are Ho Minh Truong,
right?

02:51.527 --> 02:52.516
Huh?

02:52.861 --> 02:56.627
My father is in America.
He's a pilot.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.598
He's gone. My mother, too.

03:04.340 --> 03:05.432
Answer my question.

How would you like

03:34.136 --> 03:35.569
(Dominic)
Do I have a choice?

03:35.638 --> 03:37.572
Eight seconds. Six.

03:37.640 --> 03:40.268
Why can't we hover like
regular helicopter people?

03:40.342 --> 03:41.400
Four seconds.

03:41.477 --> 03:42.967

to stop a--

03:45.381 --> 03:46.609
Now.

Give me back the turbos.

04:08.070 --> 04:09.697
[engines revving]

04:21.916 --> 04:23.509
I was lousy, huh?

04:26.121 --> 04:27.782
We're alive.

04:27.923 --> 04:29.618
Yeah, but I was lousy.

04:29.692 --> 04:31.626
Need a little more practice.

04:32.027 --> 04:34.018
Yeah, maybe tomorrow, String.

04:34.496 --> 04:36.691
I'll be on

lt shouldn't take more than

05:06.528 --> 05:09.019
lt's not like
you'd be missing anything.

05:09.098 --> 05:10.895
Well, maybe
some cello music

05:10.966 --> 05:13.491
and the mellow mating tones
of the red-tipped sparrow,

05:13.569 --> 05:15.537
but l can always send you
a cassette of that.

05:15.604 --> 05:17.663
You can't send me
pure, fresh air.

05:17.740 --> 05:21.198
You'll be flying
radar officer
on a high-altitude recon jet.

05:21.276 --> 05:23.073
You'll be on oxygen
most of the time.

05:23.145 --> 05:24.908
What's purer than oxygen?

05:25.381 --> 05:27.246
Forget the view.
Forget fresh air.

05:27.316 --> 05:30.046
l'm talking
about an American pilot
who's going to steal

05:30.119 --> 05:31.450
our hottest
tactical aircraft

05:31.520 --> 05:33.750
and deliver it
to the Russians.

05:34.056 --> 05:35.523
Somebody's got to stop him.

05:35.591 --> 05:37.024
We don't know
who he is.

05:37.092 --> 05:39.117
We only know
that the plan
is to steal one

05:39.194 --> 05:41.389
when we deploy
the first planes next week.

05:41.463 --> 05:43.328
He could be
any one of those pilots.

05:43.399 --> 05:44.423
Replace them.

05:44.500 --> 05:45.467
We can't.

05:45.534 --> 05:48.469
The ferry pilots are also
the training officers
after delivery.

05:48.537 --> 05:52.371
Replacing them could
slow everything down
by at least six months.

05:53.242 --> 05:54.766
[stops playing]

05:55.744 --> 05:57.177
What a shame.

06:04.987 --> 06:08.514
A multi-million dollar plane
is about to be handed over
to the Russians

06:08.590 --> 06:11.787
and your classification
of the problem is ''shame.''

06:12.060 --> 06:13.425
l compliment you.

06:13.495 --> 06:15.486
Your mastery of silence
is exceeded

06:15.564 --> 06:17.464
only by your facility
at understatement.

06:17.533 --> 06:19.967
But measuring this
with the word ''shame''

06:20.035 --> 06:23.527
surpasses all your
previous achievements
in articulation.

06:23.605 --> 06:25.038
Why, thank you.

06:25.607 --> 06:29.202
Since you seem to be removed
from the problems
of the world today,

06:29.545 --> 06:31.775
perhaps we should
bring you up-to-date.

06:31.980 --> 06:34.813
You see,
there are these bad guys.

06:35.384 --> 06:37.409
They're called the Russians.

06:37.719 --> 06:39.277
l think l've heard of them.

06:39.721 --> 06:41.154
And then there's us.

06:41.223 --> 06:42.622
What do they call us?

06:42.691 --> 06:44.750
lt varies in different parts
of the world,

06:44.793 --> 06:47.455
but for the sake
of this conversation,

06:47.830 --> 06:49.855
we'll call ourselves
the ''good guys.''

06:49.932 --> 06:51.866
So how do you tell them
from us?

06:51.934 --> 06:53.299
That's easy.

06:53.368 --> 06:55.029
We wear white hats.

06:56.605 --> 06:59.233
You'd look good
in a white hat, Mr. Hawke.

06:59.308 --> 07:00.570
Very good.

07:05.581 --> 07:06.707
Well,

07:07.583 --> 07:09.983
l guess we'd better
get one for Dominic, too.

07:10.052 --> 07:13.180
(Archangel)
Dominic will never pass
as a military pilot.

07:14.857 --> 07:16.688
We'll work somethin' out.

07:30.839 --> 07:32.932
[airplane engines whirring]

07:47.356 --> 07:49.017
They're great, huh?

07:49.858 --> 07:50.916
Yeah.

07:55.764 --> 07:57.732
Sure glad they're ours.

08:02.137 --> 08:03.900
(Winner)
Hey, if you're going
for a tan,

08:03.972 --> 08:06.770
l'd suggest you slip out
of that flight suit.

08:06.842 --> 08:08.571
What are you starin' at?

08:09.144 --> 08:12.079
You remember an Army captain
in Nam by the name of
Stringfellow Hawke?

08:12.147 --> 08:13.876
Yeah. Flew Hueys.

08:14.349 --> 08:16.544
He pulled me
out of lndian territory once.

08:16.618 --> 08:17.812
Good reason to remember.

08:17.886 --> 08:20.286
Who could forget a name
like Stringfellow Hawke?

08:20.355 --> 08:21.879
Said he was
gonna fly civilian.

08:21.957 --> 08:23.322

08:23.392 --> 08:25.417
On the Army exchange program.

08:25.494 --> 08:26.984
(Winner)
No kiddin'.

08:27.563 --> 08:30.361
He probably couldn't
make it on the outside.

08:30.866 --> 08:34.232
Some of us just
make lousy civilians,
you know what l mean?

08:34.303 --> 08:35.292
[laughing]

08:48.317 --> 08:49.807
See you later, chief.

09:08.837 --> 09:11.738
Do you still expect people
to read your silences?

09:16.411 --> 09:18.606
Only if l don't know
what to say.

09:21.249 --> 09:23.479

09:23.552 --> 09:25.645

09:29.625 --> 09:31.388
Did you look for me?

09:33.862 --> 09:36.296
By the time l got out
of the hospital,

09:36.698 --> 09:37.892
Saigon had fallen.

09:37.966 --> 09:39.228
Did you try?

09:41.103 --> 09:42.468
Does it matter?

09:43.972 --> 09:44.961
No.

09:46.475 --> 09:48.375
What are you doing here?

09:49.611 --> 09:52.011
Trying to bring
my family together.

10:00.722 --> 10:02.952
(Dominic)
l've been hanging around here
waiting for you

10:03.025 --> 10:04.151
for 10 minutes.

10:04.226 --> 10:07.457
You know what
they call guys that hang
around men's rooms?

10:07.529 --> 10:09.121
What do you want?
A tip?

10:09.197 --> 10:11.631
Look, l said
l'd be your cover,

10:11.700 --> 10:14.635
but you could
have made me a pilot
or a mechanic, but no.

10:14.703 --> 10:16.728
l told you, l need you
on and off the base.

10:16.805 --> 10:18.432
Nobody notices a guy
with a mop.

10:18.507 --> 10:20.475
They do in a room
like this.

10:20.542 --> 10:22.032
Ah, just a minute,
we want privacy.

10:22.110 --> 10:24.442
Hold the--
hold the flying pattern
for a minute, will you?

10:24.513 --> 10:27.073
Uh, we're changin' the ice
in the head.

10:28.884 --> 10:30.374
We've got privacy.

10:32.654 --> 10:34.781
There's a Nhi Huong Truong
on the base.

10:34.856 --> 10:37.222
l want to know her status
and reason for being here.

10:37.292 --> 10:38.554
Personal or business?

10:38.627 --> 10:39.753
Personal.

10:40.495 --> 10:41.826
Don't press it.

10:42.297 --> 10:44.629
What did you learn
from those guys out there?

10:44.700 --> 10:47.567
That their capacity
for alcohol hasn't diminished.

10:47.636 --> 10:49.900
You better duck in a stall
before l let this guy in

10:49.971 --> 10:51.962
or you're gonna
get some funny looks.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.372
For what? l'm an officer...

10:54.943 --> 10:56.308
and a gentlemen.

11:07.022 --> 11:08.580
lf his mother was
still in Vietnam,

11:08.657 --> 11:10.648
you think
he'd tell you where?

11:12.127 --> 11:13.458
[speaking Vietnamese]

11:13.528 --> 11:14.995
[speaking Vietnamese]

11:15.063 --> 11:17.258
(Zimmer)
He's never even
seen his father.

11:17.332 --> 11:19.732
Uh, um,
all this is unnecessary.

11:20.135 --> 11:21.864
Look, you're supposed
to be helping me,

11:21.937 --> 11:23.427
not holding
an interrogation.

11:23.505 --> 11:25.473
Would you please
just sign the visa form?

11:25.540 --> 11:29.135
Mr. Zimmer,
this is my country, not yours.

11:30.312 --> 11:33.110
l decide
what is necessary here or not.

11:33.181 --> 11:35.945
As long as it doesn't take
more than 20 minutes.

11:36.184 --> 11:38.778
My country runs
on a precise schedule.

11:40.655 --> 11:41.644
Hmm.

11:42.891 --> 11:45.359
[Quoc continues

12:00.108 --> 12:02.668
His father is
whoever l say he is.

12:03.345 --> 12:05.836
Now you just sign the visa
and say goodbye,

12:06.114 --> 12:08.446
because l know
what your orders are.

12:39.648 --> 12:41.445
(Roper)
We're on
our fifth bottle here

12:41.516 --> 12:44.007
and we have yet
to have a legitimate toast.

12:44.085 --> 12:46.349
(Simms)
Not enough booze in us
to get that silly.

12:46.421 --> 12:48.753
lt's not silly,
it's a responsibility
to the champagne.

12:48.824 --> 12:49.984
lt's a-- it's a formality.

12:50.058 --> 12:52.185
lt's not like we're drinkin'
a case of beer here.

12:52.260 --> 12:54.353
Okay, okay,
that's enough.

12:54.963 --> 12:57.989
Who has anything nice

12:58.300 --> 13:00.860
to say about
Stringfellow Hawke?

13:13.048 --> 13:14.174
He's quiet.

13:14.249 --> 13:15.876
That's good. He's quiet.
That's good.

13:15.951 --> 13:16.975
He's pretty.

13:17.085 --> 13:19.986
[chuckling]
He's pretty. That's good.

13:20.188 --> 13:22.554
(Roper)
He looks nice
in that new uniform, too.

13:22.624 --> 13:24.216
Uh, not that nice.

13:24.292 --> 13:26.157
l think
you're right about that.

13:26.261 --> 13:29.355
Maybe we ought to stick with,
uh, ''He's pretty quiet.''

13:31.266 --> 13:33.598
Here's to Hawke.
Welcome home.

13:34.269 --> 13:36.669
Wait a minute. Hold it.
There's more to the ceremony.

13:36.738 --> 13:39.764
You've got to
make a speech, Hawke.
Stand up

13:40.609 --> 13:43.772
and be a fool,
or all this don't count.

13:44.346 --> 13:45.335
[laughs]

13:58.693 --> 14:00.217
l got to go to the bathroom.

14:00.295 --> 14:01.762
[all laughing]

14:06.067 --> 14:07.227
(Roper)
Okay, Josh, my boy,

14:07.302 --> 14:09.167
why don't you give me
a little port rudder

14:09.237 --> 14:11.603
and pull your nose up
about 5 degrees.

14:11.673 --> 14:13.971
Can't you just
say take a left turn
and don't fall?

14:14.042 --> 14:15.634
That wouldn't be military,
would it?

14:15.710 --> 14:16.972
Right. Right.

14:18.179 --> 14:19.441
And we're not fit

14:19.514 --> 14:22.642
for the world of civilians
and humans, right?

14:23.652 --> 14:24.676
lt's different.

14:24.753 --> 14:27.187
Different. Different.

14:28.657 --> 14:30.522
You know,
for guys like us,
it's like a,

14:30.592 --> 14:32.651
it's a ballpark
with no fences.

14:32.727 --> 14:34.991
There's no way
to hit a home run.

14:35.497 --> 14:37.863
But if you don't get a hit
once in a while,

14:37.899 --> 14:41.767
they're--they're just
waiting to beat on you

14:41.903 --> 14:44.371
and tell you
you're not fit for anything

14:44.439 --> 14:46.634
besides burnin' out villages.

14:46.942 --> 14:49.274
Tried his luck
as a civilian
a couple of years ago.

14:49.344 --> 14:50.743
lt kicked him
around pretty good.

14:50.812 --> 14:52.609
Don't talk for me, Sam.

14:53.949 --> 14:56.918
You know, l've been
wearing blue uniforms

14:56.952 --> 14:59.352
since--since
my first shave.

14:59.421 --> 15:01.946
Yeah, l, l've been
into this

15:02.057 --> 15:04.685
wave the flag and go
for broke business

15:04.759 --> 15:07.387
since l, since l
traded in my virginity

15:07.429 --> 15:10.592
for a pair of wings and a,
and a fancy football helmet

15:10.665 --> 15:11.689
with a microphone
in it.

15:11.766 --> 15:13.393
And you want
to know something? Huh?

15:13.468 --> 15:15.459
You want
to know something?

15:15.537 --> 15:18.267
You know,
it all don't mean nothin'

15:19.107 --> 15:23.043
outside of this
prefabricated world
that we live in here.

15:23.211 --> 15:24.303
[laughs]

15:24.579 --> 15:26.570

15:27.382 --> 15:29.350
Could be bull! lt is.

15:30.452 --> 15:32.716
Uh, uh, l--l went out
into the world

15:33.388 --> 15:35.481
of worsteds
and attache cases

15:35.557 --> 15:38.355
and l was introduced around
as the resident freak.

15:39.127 --> 15:40.719
Oh, l mean,
they--they treat you nice

15:40.795 --> 15:42.922
and all that
kind of social puke

15:43.732 --> 15:46.758
and then they, they wanted
to see my medals.

15:47.469 --> 15:50.802
And then they asked me
how many people

15:51.072 --> 15:54.166
l figured l--l burned
to death

15:54.242 --> 15:55.504
at 4,000 feet.

15:55.577 --> 15:58.045
'Cause they don't know.
They don't care.

15:58.646 --> 16:01.171
l spent three years
of my life in hell.

16:01.783 --> 16:03.842
And they don't
give a damn.

16:04.219 --> 16:06.710
lt don't have nothing
to do with them.

16:07.522 --> 16:09.456
Then who the hell
are we doing it for?

16:09.524 --> 16:11.253
l do it for myself.

16:16.197 --> 16:17.721
Let go of me, Sam.

16:19.768 --> 16:22.532
l can stagger
without any help at all...

16:27.542 --> 16:29.601
How long has he
been like that?

16:29.911 --> 16:32.402
Since they passed him
over for promotion.

16:34.983 --> 16:36.473
When was that?

16:36.551 --> 16:37.916
Over a year ago.

16:40.321 --> 16:41.845
And before?

16:41.923 --> 16:43.390
What in the hell
are you up to?

16:43.458 --> 16:44.516
My job.

16:44.592 --> 16:45.718
Which is?

16:47.128 --> 16:50.029
Working with you
as an exchange pilot.

16:50.098 --> 16:52.293
That's what your orders say.
You have as much business

16:52.367 --> 16:54.062
doing that as l do
shuttlin' a Huey.

16:54.135 --> 16:57.002
They brought you back,
recalled you
for this one mission.

16:57.072 --> 16:58.369
How do you know?

16:58.440 --> 17:00.203
My wife is
Gen. Masello's secretary.

17:00.275 --> 17:02.709
l also know your orders
didn't come
from Air Force HQ.

17:02.777 --> 17:05.678
They came from Washington.
Langley, to be exact.

17:05.747 --> 17:08.807
She can lose her job
digging into things like that.

17:08.883 --> 17:10.441
l don't think so.

17:11.219 --> 17:12.617
You and Nhi Huong
were too close

17:12.686 --> 17:14.916
for you to do
something like that to her.

17:16.691 --> 17:18.590
You've got a check ride
at 07:00 hours.

17:18.660 --> 17:20.025
Be on time.

17:20.395 --> 17:22.727
l understand your lP
is real tough.

17:27.102 --> 17:28.899
[airplane taking off]

17:56.631 --> 17:58.098
You'll have
to move that jeep.

17:58.166 --> 17:59.793
You can't leave it there,
l'm sorry.

17:59.868 --> 18:03.065
Hey, you know
where l can find
a Capt. Hawke?

18:03.138 --> 18:06.266
What'd he do, make a mess
in the officers' club,
or something?

18:06.341 --> 18:07.535
[laughs]

18:07.609 --> 18:09.804
He's the Army exchange pilot.

18:12.981 --> 18:14.039
Who's he up with?

18:14.115 --> 18:15.275
An instructor pilot.

18:15.350 --> 18:16.578
Does he have a name?

18:16.651 --> 18:17.879
Maj. Roper.

18:18.119 --> 18:19.143
Oh.

18:19.220 --> 18:20.949
(Roper)
High-frequency recorders?

18:21.656 --> 18:22.850
(Hawke)
Functioning.

18:22.924 --> 18:24.391
High-speed surveillance?

18:24.459 --> 18:26.154
I can't reach it.

18:26.227 --> 18:29.128
Loosen your shoulder straps
and check
the negative displacer.

18:33.234 --> 18:34.724
MiGs on our six.

18:43.745 --> 18:46.145
Something just
ain't right up there.

19:05.900 --> 19:07.492
I got both of 'em.

19:07.569 --> 19:08.968
(Hawke)
And me.

19:18.346 --> 19:20.177
[engine decelerating]

19:23.051 --> 19:24.746
[tires screeching]

19:42.103 --> 19:43.365
You're grounded.

19:43.438 --> 19:45.497
What are you
talking about?
You can't ground me.

19:45.573 --> 19:47.040
The hell l can't.

19:47.108 --> 19:48.040
l was right!

19:48.109 --> 19:50.577
You're not here
as an exchange pilot,
are you?

19:50.645 --> 19:52.374
Hawke, l have to
make that ferry flight.

19:52.447 --> 19:53.436
Why?

19:53.514 --> 19:54.811
'Cause it's my job!

19:56.050 --> 19:57.779
All right, there's more.

19:58.853 --> 19:59.911
What?

20:00.521 --> 20:02.455
l can't tell you, Hawke.

20:02.824 --> 20:03.916
Then you're grounded.

20:03.992 --> 20:06.017
l'm callin' in all favors.
Whatever you figure,

20:06.094 --> 20:08.255
you owe me
for old times' sake.

20:09.497 --> 20:11.931
l think you're askin' me
to overpay.

20:16.804 --> 20:19.739
lf you won't do it for me,
do it for Nhi Huong.

20:23.845 --> 20:26.780
(Archangel)
l asked for a meeting,
but why here?

20:26.848 --> 20:28.748
(Dominic)
l thought
you'd like my office.

20:28.816 --> 20:30.807
[chuckling]
You assigned me.

20:31.286 --> 20:33.982
l'm sorry l don't have time
to discuss your choice
of furnishings.

20:34.055 --> 20:36.888
lt's not my choice.
Watch your feet.

20:36.958 --> 20:39.051
What did you want
to tell me?

20:40.228 --> 20:42.753
That now we both know
Roper is our man.

20:42.830 --> 20:44.855
Don't tell me
what l know.

20:45.066 --> 20:47.591
How about telling me
something l don't know?

20:49.504 --> 20:52.803
Will you have your gladiator
sheath his sword first?

20:58.012 --> 20:59.377
(Archangel)
Thank you.

21:00.948 --> 21:03.041
Roper is married
to a Vietnamese national.

21:03.117 --> 21:04.175
Not out of the ordinary.

21:04.252 --> 21:07.619
But when you requested
information on her
through your janitor,

21:07.689 --> 21:10.055
l had her checked
into more thoroughly.

21:10.124 --> 21:11.716
l guess that means
l talked too much.

21:11.793 --> 21:13.055
Rare, but a fact.

21:13.127 --> 21:15.960
Mrs. Roper has a child,
an Amerasian son.

21:16.030 --> 21:17.827
She's been trying to get him
to the States

21:17.899 --> 21:19.332
ever since
you first arrived here.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.732
Mothers have been
known to do that.

21:22.337 --> 21:23.861
So l've heard.

21:25.006 --> 21:26.598
We checked and found
that the boy...

21:26.674 --> 21:27.800
[coughs]

21:27.875 --> 21:29.365
The kid got a name?

21:29.444 --> 21:30.672
Ho Minh.

21:30.745 --> 21:33.737
He was housed at an orphanage
till the government closed it.

21:33.815 --> 21:36.079
Then he managed to survive
in the streets for a while.

21:36.150 --> 21:38.675
The kid doesn't
have half a chance.

21:39.854 --> 21:41.981
Can't you get him
out of there?

21:43.491 --> 21:46.358
lt seems he is now
a ward of the U.S.S.R.

21:46.427 --> 21:48.657
With the cooperation
of the VC government.

21:48.730 --> 21:51.756
Ho Minh has been transported
to a Russian air base

21:51.866 --> 21:53.493
at Omrylkot, Russia.

21:53.901 --> 21:55.266
(Dominic)
So what?

21:55.937 --> 22:00.135
Omrylkot is only 180 miles
from Alaska.

22:00.575 --> 22:02.600
One of the planes
is scheduled to be delivered

22:02.677 --> 22:05.271
to Shemya Air Force Base
in Alaska.

22:05.346 --> 22:06.540
And Roper is the pilot?

22:06.614 --> 22:07.603
Not yet.

22:07.682 --> 22:11.209
But since he's the commander,
he makes out the duty chart.

22:11.919 --> 22:14.046
You've done
quite well, Hawke.

22:14.122 --> 22:16.386
By intuition, you've managed
to open the latch

22:16.457 --> 22:18.049
that opened the door for us.

22:18.126 --> 22:19.684
What about Roper?

22:20.361 --> 22:21.487
He's a traitor.

22:21.562 --> 22:22.654
Not yet, he's not.

22:22.730 --> 22:24.891
Well, the Firm is not
going to wait till he is.

22:24.966 --> 22:26.194
And the boy?

22:29.937 --> 22:32.269
A 1 2-year-old waif
is no trade

22:32.340 --> 22:35.309
for a newly designed,
multi-million dollar plane.

22:36.711 --> 22:39.509
Depends on
who does the trading,
doesn't it?

22:39.580 --> 22:40.740
l do.

22:43.818 --> 22:45.786
When is Ho Minh's birthday?

22:49.824 --> 22:53.316
He's 1 2 years old.
Don't let your imagination
run away with you.

22:56.130 --> 22:59.531
l don't want you
to do anything about Roper.
Let him be.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.795
You expect me
to just sit back and let him--

23:01.869 --> 23:04.770
l'll guarantee no plane
will be turned over
to the Russians.

23:04.839 --> 23:06.773
You're not co-signing
an auto loan.

23:06.841 --> 23:08.775
Your guarantee is not enough.

23:08.843 --> 23:10.310
lt'll have to be.

23:10.511 --> 23:12.035
And if it's not?

23:13.147 --> 23:14.409
[sighs]

23:17.351 --> 23:19.751
l'll trade Airwolf
for the boy.

23:44.812 --> 23:46.507
[tires screeching]

23:50.451 --> 23:51.975
[birds chirping]

24:06.367 --> 24:07.994
What do you want?

24:17.945 --> 24:19.742
You knew that was comin'.

24:19.814 --> 24:21.372
l know l deserved it, too.

24:21.449 --> 24:22.746
Get up.

24:24.852 --> 24:26.217
[grunts]

24:26.554 --> 24:28.317
What was that one for,
interest?

24:28.389 --> 24:30.687
That was instead
of a firin' squad.

24:32.793 --> 24:35.694
They don't shoot you
for makin' a fool of yourself
on a check ride.

24:35.763 --> 24:38.755
They do for turnin' aircraft
over to the Russians.

24:40.001 --> 24:41.866
l don't know
what you're talking about.

24:41.936 --> 24:43.904
You'd better
start rememberin'.

24:44.472 --> 24:48.067
Because l'm the only thing
standing between you
and a blindfold.

25:08.596 --> 25:10.564
[Zimmer speaking Russian]

25:20.875 --> 25:22.502
[speaking Russian]

26:24.138 --> 26:25.935
[jeep engine running]

26:42.623 --> 26:44.352
[speaking Russian]

26:51.799 --> 26:53.960
[people chattering in Russian]

26:56.203 --> 26:57.727
[phone ringing]

27:05.980 --> 27:08.881
Hey, mister,
could you tell me something?

27:10.251 --> 27:12.048
Are you hungry again?

27:12.253 --> 27:14.153
Yeah, that, too.

27:14.555 --> 27:18.082
But it's about this picture.

27:20.194 --> 27:22.162
Yeah. What about it?

27:22.496 --> 27:26.091
Could you tell me
which one is my father?

27:29.470 --> 27:31.631
Which one would you
like it to be?

27:31.772 --> 27:34.172
Any one of them is okay.

27:35.276 --> 27:36.368
[sighs]

27:39.180 --> 27:42.013
Damn it, Sam.
You're too smart to think
you could get away with this.

27:42.083 --> 27:44.574
l'm not a traitor. Before
l'd turn that plane
over to anybody,

27:44.652 --> 27:46.381
l'd ditch with it
in the Bering Sea.

27:46.454 --> 27:48.251
Yeah, and freeze to death
in 1 1 minutes.

27:48.322 --> 27:50.051
lt'd be worth the gamble.

27:50.858 --> 27:52.348
You've never been
an idiot before.

27:52.426 --> 27:54.587
l've never been a father
before either.

27:55.563 --> 27:57.155
l have a son, Hawke.

27:57.298 --> 27:59.163
A son
l've never seen before.

27:59.233 --> 28:01.258
A son who doesn't
even know who l am.

28:04.171 --> 28:05.934
Why didn't he come out
with Nhi Huong?

28:06.040 --> 28:07.564
They were separated.

28:07.641 --> 28:09.541
He was in
the Swiss Hospital there.

28:09.610 --> 28:12.101
He was due
to come on the next flight,
but he never made it.

28:12.179 --> 28:13.339
Nhi wanted to stay.

28:13.414 --> 28:15.848
l convinced her
he'd be all right.
That was the only way.

28:15.916 --> 28:17.440
How did the Russians
contact you?

28:17.518 --> 28:19.383
Hanoi contacted Nhi first.

28:19.754 --> 28:21.915
They strung us out
for over a year,

28:21.989 --> 28:24.287
finally turned us over
to a Russian.

28:28.395 --> 28:30.329
You really think
you can pull this off?

28:30.397 --> 28:32.092
l figured l'd make
a navigational error

28:32.166 --> 28:33.895
and be forced down
in their territory.

28:33.968 --> 28:35.833
ln time l'd be exchanged.

28:35.903 --> 28:38.201
You said you'd ditch the plane
before you'd turn it over.

28:38.272 --> 28:40.502
That's exactly what
l was going to do.
Call an emergency

28:40.574 --> 28:42.667
and ditch before
l get to the island.

28:42.743 --> 28:45.041
l figured
they'd give me my boy
just for tryin'.

28:45.112 --> 28:46.704
You really believe that?

28:46.781 --> 28:48.544
(Nhi)
lt will work.

28:48.616 --> 28:50.914
lf you'd just stay
out of it, Hawke.

28:53.888 --> 28:55.981
(Hawke)
l can't stay
out of it.

28:56.056 --> 28:58.490
What would you do
if it was your son?

29:00.394 --> 29:02.089
You owe it to Sam.

29:02.163 --> 29:05.030
He saved your life
when it still meant
something to you.

29:05.099 --> 29:06.657
l never told you that.

29:13.641 --> 29:15.370
What about it, Hawke?

29:16.944 --> 29:18.343
Pay Sam back.

29:20.748 --> 29:23.478
A man has a right
to see his son.

29:31.358 --> 29:33.826
(Dominic)
No! Not a chance!

29:33.894 --> 29:35.225
(Hawke)
Just hold on, Dom.

29:35.296 --> 29:38.026
l can't have an excitable man
making precision
adjustments on it.

29:38.098 --> 29:41.033
You see what l mean?
You're not even
thinking straight.

29:41.135 --> 29:43.535
Look, you can't say a thing
about it on the phone.

29:43.604 --> 29:45.367
Archangel probably
has it tapped.

29:45.439 --> 29:48.840
That only saves me
from havin' to make
a direct call to Michael.

29:49.109 --> 29:50.599
Just don't you
pick up a tail.

29:50.945 --> 29:54.073
Me? Nobody tails me.

29:54.181 --> 29:56.672
Then I can trust you
to handle everything.

29:56.750 --> 29:59.651
Doesn't my saying no
mean anything to you?

30:00.120 --> 30:03.180
Only when you mean it.
See you later.

30:04.458 --> 30:05.652
[sighs]

30:06.193 --> 30:08.218
[airplane engines whirring]

30:09.330 --> 30:10.524
Oh, Michael,

30:10.598 --> 30:14.034
you'll find that if you add
some pine-scented detergent

30:14.101 --> 30:15.728
to your scrub water,

30:15.803 --> 30:19.796
you'll give your bathrooms
that fresh outdoor aroma.

30:20.040 --> 30:21.439
[laughing]

30:23.210 --> 30:25.303
All, right, we're takin' off
in three sections.

30:25.379 --> 30:27.643
Winner and Jones
to Corpus Christi,

30:27.715 --> 30:29.444
Simms and Lewis to Orlando,

30:29.516 --> 30:31.313
and l'm taking the Alaska run
with Hawke.

30:31.385 --> 30:34.013
These flight plans
and re-fueling points

30:34.088 --> 30:35.749
read like
a crossword puzzle, Sam.

30:35.823 --> 30:38.257
That's how they read
the foreign satellite radar.

30:38.325 --> 30:40.850
l want to use
low-level flying
whenever possible.

30:40.928 --> 30:42.225
Desert and water.

30:42.296 --> 30:43.957
Let's make this
as difficult as we can.

30:44.031 --> 30:46.363
For who? l didn't think
this was still a secret.

30:46.433 --> 30:48.993
Maybe not,
we're not advertisin' either.

30:50.304 --> 30:51.896
Any further questions?

30:52.673 --> 30:54.903
All right then,
good luck to you all.

30:56.043 --> 30:58.603
Hawke, l'd like to see you
for a second.

31:00.915 --> 31:01.904
[sighs]

31:01.982 --> 31:04.542
Everything going
the way you want it so far?

31:05.052 --> 31:08.180
Uh, well, the flight plan
ought to put enough gaps
in radar

31:08.255 --> 31:09.483
to keep
Air Defense busy.

31:09.556 --> 31:12.150
Unless we messed them up
too much and they
call the flight back.

31:12.226 --> 31:14.353
Once you take off,
there's no turnin' back.

31:14.428 --> 31:17.886
You just go deaf and dumb
and you do just
what l tell you.

31:17.965 --> 31:21.162
Thank you.
You want to tell me now
how you're going to do it?

31:21.535 --> 31:23.093
With a helicopter.

31:29.510 --> 31:31.410
Eagle flight,
you're cleared for take off.

31:31.745 --> 31:33.679
(Roper)
Eagle flight rolling.

32:01.608 --> 32:04.133
(Hawke)
We've just passed
the point of no return.

32:04.311 --> 32:05.369
Roger.

32:35.976 --> 32:37.409
[tires skidding]

32:50.290 --> 32:52.315
(controller)
Sir, l've lost contact
with Eagle Three.

32:52.393 --> 32:53.553
Give him a call.

32:53.627 --> 32:55.356
lt could be atmospheric.

33:00.401 --> 33:02.528
[airplane engine turning off]

33:06.073 --> 33:07.165
You're a janitor.

33:07.241 --> 33:08.674
You see how clean
that desert is?

33:08.742 --> 33:09.731
[laughs]

33:09.810 --> 33:12.973
You'll get a radio signal
when it's time to take off.

33:13.047 --> 33:14.844
Resume your
present flight plan.

33:14.915 --> 33:16.974
How am l gonna explain
you're not with me?

33:17.051 --> 33:18.678
You won't have to.

33:34.601 --> 33:36.728
(Hawke)
Sure is cold out here.

33:36.804 --> 33:39.568
(Dominic)
Cold? You call this cold? Ha.

33:40.074 --> 33:41.632
l remember the time
your dad and me

33:41.708 --> 33:44.268
were ferrying planes
from Thule to England.

33:44.344 --> 33:46.369
We had to stop over
in lceland.

33:46.447 --> 33:49.177
lt got so cold
on that one flight

33:49.249 --> 33:51.683
that the engines froze
right in the middle
of the air

33:51.752 --> 33:53.583
and we couldn't come down.

33:55.656 --> 33:56.953
[laughing]

34:02.996 --> 34:04.486
[both laughing]

34:18.645 --> 34:22.103
Ah. That ought to warm you up.

34:23.382 --> 34:24.509
Yeah.

34:41.301 --> 34:42.460
[clanging]

34:43.937 --> 34:45.130
[beeping]

34:48.475 --> 34:50.237
[ignition blasting]

34:52.312 --> 34:54.109
[engine accelerating]

34:56.650 --> 34:58.242
[Airwolf revving]

35:25.445 --> 35:27.913
2,000. 4,000.

35:29.483 --> 35:32.816
8,000. 12,000.

35:35.622 --> 35:36.646
There he is.

35:36.723 --> 35:37.985
Eagle Three. Base.

35:38.058 --> 35:39.821
(Hawke)
Eagle Three to Base.

35:39.893 --> 35:41.724
Three, we've have been
unable to read you

35:41.795 --> 35:43.319
for the past 20 minutes.
Over.

35:43.397 --> 35:46.195
Sorry, Base.
I had a pressurization
leak indicated,

35:46.266 --> 35:48.666
I dropped to below
Angel's ten to check it out.

35:48.735 --> 35:50.566
3 are you declaring
an emergency?

35:50.671 --> 35:52.229
Negative. Negative.

35:52.306 --> 35:55.104
It's a malfunctioning light.
I'm climbing back
to Angel's thirty.

35:55.175 --> 35:57.871
Roger, Eagle Three.
Cleared 300.

35:58.011 --> 36:00.639
Keep an eye on him,
if he drops off again,
l want to know.

36:00.714 --> 36:01.738
Yes, sir.

36:03.417 --> 36:05.044
We got away with it so far.

36:05.118 --> 36:06.244
(Dominic)
Sure.

36:06.320 --> 36:09.346
Now all we have to do
is attack Russia, steal a kid,

36:09.423 --> 36:11.687
and try not to get caught
by our own government.

36:11.758 --> 36:13.817
In the meantime,
I still don't know

36:13.894 --> 36:16.328
what all these knobs
and--and--and buttons are for.

36:16.396 --> 36:18.023
I wouldn't sweat it, Dom.

36:18.098 --> 36:21.124
If you touch
that eject button,
you'll be the first to know.

36:21.201 --> 36:22.190
Oh.

36:29.876 --> 36:31.104
[beeping]

36:31.712 --> 36:33.145
Hey, what's that?

36:33.280 --> 36:35.043
Put on the descrambler.

36:35.115 --> 36:36.810
Oh, sure.

36:39.453 --> 36:40.977
That's not the one.

36:41.989 --> 36:43.354
Okay, which one is it?

36:43.423 --> 36:44.583
Upper left.

36:44.925 --> 36:47.723
Right next
to the Shrike missile.
Be careful.

36:50.530 --> 36:53.090
(Archangel)
Good afternoon, Stringfellow.

36:53.467 --> 36:56.561
I don't suppose you'd consider
giving me your coordinates?

36:56.637 --> 36:58.502
Dom's the navigator here.

36:58.572 --> 37:01.541
Oh, good.
Then at least the cockpit
has been freshly scrubbed.

37:01.808 --> 37:03.799
(Hawke)
How long did it take you
to figure out

37:03.877 --> 37:05.105
what I was going to do?

37:05.178 --> 37:08.045
(Archangel)
When you disappeared
on the radar screen.

37:08.248 --> 37:11.684
Hawke, l'd like to see you
bring the boy back.

37:11.752 --> 37:13.344
But we've got to
keep the plane.

37:13.420 --> 37:14.580
Amazing!

37:14.655 --> 37:18.352
Behind that
impeccable white suit
beats a heart--

37:18.425 --> 37:20.620
of recyclable plastic.

37:20.694 --> 37:22.127
That's very good, Dominic.

37:22.195 --> 37:25.358
Hawke, please give him
a sugar cube and a pat
on the neck for me.

37:25.432 --> 37:27.798
(Archangel)
I may not be accurate
about your location,

37:27.868 --> 37:29.631
but I can sure
make an educated guess

37:29.703 --> 37:32.501
as to your destination.
Can I assist?

37:33.040 --> 37:34.769
Yeah, you can feed my dog.

37:34.875 --> 37:35.864
[laughs]

37:37.077 --> 37:38.840
How did you know l was...

37:40.447 --> 37:43.075
Sometimes, Hawke,
you amaze even me.

37:43.150 --> 37:44.310
Good luck.

37:44.951 --> 37:46.350
[phone beeping]

37:46.787 --> 37:48.584
(Dominic)
How come Archangel's
''good luck''

37:48.655 --> 37:49.986
always sounds
like ''goodbye?''

37:50.057 --> 37:51.752
Turn on the radar scanner.

37:52.192 --> 37:55.684
Um, do I guess,
or will you give me a hint?

37:55.762 --> 37:58.663
It's the green light
next to the chain gun power.

37:58.732 --> 38:00.199
(Dominic)
Oh.

38:00.267 --> 38:03.828
Says here we're 2.5 miles
from Nome, Alaska.

38:03.904 --> 38:04.996
Whatever happened
to that

38:05.072 --> 38:06.835
''flying by the seat
of your pants'' stuff?

38:06.907 --> 38:08.568
Oh, it went out
when designers started

38:08.642 --> 38:10.507
to write their names
on your behind.

38:10.577 --> 38:12.044
Ferry Three to Control.

38:12.479 --> 38:13.639
Eagle Three. Go.

38:13.714 --> 38:17.150
Ferry Three.
I'll be dropping altitude
and altering directions.

38:17.217 --> 38:19.048
This is not an emergency.

38:19.419 --> 38:21.819
I repeat,
this is not an emergency.

38:21.888 --> 38:24.652
Negative Eagle Three!
Maintain your present
heading and altitude.

38:24.725 --> 38:27.489
You are not authorized
to deviate
from the flight plan. Over.

38:27.561 --> 38:29.392
Strap her down, Dom.

38:53.320 --> 38:56.312
Why not let those people
mow their own lawns, huh?

38:56.690 --> 38:58.624
Increasing speed.

39:00.727 --> 39:02.160
[accelerating]

39:07.267 --> 39:09.462
l can't think of
any way to help him.

39:09.870 --> 39:11.735
(Archangel)
Short of an invasion
of Russia,

39:11.805 --> 39:14.467
all we can do is be
restrained spectators.

39:16.710 --> 39:18.940
Too bad.
He's a very capable man.

39:19.012 --> 39:20.639
Hawke or Dominic?

39:21.615 --> 39:23.583
l never met
Dominic Santini.

39:24.384 --> 39:27.478
Well, he's not nearly
as attractive as Stringfellow.

39:28.655 --> 39:30.987
Well, l hope
both of them make it.

39:31.591 --> 39:33.684
For professional reasons,
l'm sure.

39:34.461 --> 39:35.792
Of course.

39:38.632 --> 39:40.827
[speaking Russian]

39:48.141 --> 39:49.768
[speaking Russian]

40:21.475 --> 40:24.876
String, it's time
for some serious thoughts
on religion.

40:25.245 --> 40:27.008
We just crossed
our protective zone.

40:27.080 --> 40:28.843
We're approaching
foreign territory.

40:28.915 --> 40:30.280
I'm slowing.

40:31.685 --> 40:34.017
I'm going to match
Ferry Three's air speed.

40:44.431 --> 40:46.456
Hey, you invite anyone else
on this trip?

40:46.533 --> 40:47.500
How many?

40:47.567 --> 40:48.761
Four.

40:53.073 --> 40:56.270
The readout says MiG-23,
20 miles away.

40:56.977 --> 40:59.172
Now will you act
a little worried?

41:07.954 --> 41:11.117
Check the ground scanner
and see
what's at the airstrip.

41:12.559 --> 41:16.188
Three low buildings,
some equipment,
and a radar trailer.

41:16.263 --> 41:18.254
Which one shows the most heat
on the scanner?

41:18.331 --> 41:21.027
The one on the west end
is giving off
the hottest signals.

41:21.101 --> 41:22.295
That's where
Ho Minh will be.

41:22.369 --> 41:23.927
I'll blind them,
you make them deaf.

41:24.004 --> 41:25.801
You're forgetting
the MiGs.

41:25.906 --> 41:27.999
We'll send 'em
a decoy missile to chase.

41:28.074 --> 41:29.041
You ready?

41:29.109 --> 41:30.770
Will you take no
for an answer?

41:30.844 --> 41:31.868
Sure.

41:36.816 --> 41:38.477
[missile whizzing]

41:39.486 --> 41:40.748
[beeping]

41:41.521 --> 41:42.954
[static sound screeching]

41:43.023 --> 41:44.012
[grunting]

41:44.424 --> 41:46.415
(Dominic)
They're deaf,
but they're not blind.

41:46.493 --> 41:47.960
(Hawke)
We're coming in
like a jet.

41:48.028 --> 41:49.120
You know the procedure.

41:49.195 --> 41:50.662
I know we never
did it right once!

41:50.730 --> 41:52.527
There's always a first time.

41:52.732 --> 41:53.960
[beeping]

41:54.234 --> 41:56.031
Targeting countdown.

41:56.102 --> 41:59.196
Yeah, yeah,
all right, I'm ready.
You've got all the firepower.

41:59.272 --> 42:01.069
Be ready to cut turbos.

43:18.685 --> 43:20.312
Come on, kid.
We're headin' back

43:20.387 --> 43:22.821
for the land of hamburgers
and heartburn.

43:23.089 --> 43:24.078
[laughs]

44:51.144 --> 44:52.975
Are you my father?

45:00.120 --> 45:02.418
You'll know him
when you see him.

45:18.037 --> 45:19.231
(Roper)
Get the ball now, boy.

45:19.305 --> 45:21.330
(Archangel)
You're going to receive
a reprimand

45:21.407 --> 45:22.431
on your service record

45:22.509 --> 45:24.636
for not arriving in Alaska
with Roper.

45:24.711 --> 45:26.542
Does that mean
l'm not gonna make General?

45:26.613 --> 45:28.240
l certainly hope so.

45:28.348 --> 45:31.408
Have you considered a career
in airplane theft?

45:32.118 --> 45:34.552
l still haven't
quite figured out
how you managed

45:34.621 --> 45:38.022
to keep switching planes
and still keep our radar
in the dark.

45:40.794 --> 45:43.228
You have to ask Dominic
about that.

45:43.296 --> 45:44.593
Dominic's not talking to me.

45:44.664 --> 45:46.723
l'd like to keep it that way.

45:50.170 --> 45:53.936
Well, if you'll excuse me,
l think l'll just
go stare at the lake.

45:58.812 --> 46:02.248
Looking at them,
l know it was all worth it.

46:06.252 --> 46:09.415
Maybe it's about time
for some truth
about Ho Minh?

46:11.191 --> 46:14.422
Ho Minh's last name is Roper.

46:16.062 --> 46:17.529
lt always has been.

46:21.968 --> 46:24.402
l guess l gotta live
with that answer.

46:26.472 --> 46:28.702
lt's the only answer
l'll ever give.

46:31.444 --> 46:32.877
Fair enough.

46:35.715 --> 46:38.650
But if your son ever
needs me, l'll be there.

46:40.820 --> 46:42.185
You'll have to be.

46:42.655 --> 46:44.885
We're giving him
an American name.

46:45.391 --> 46:46.551
What's that?

46:46.960 --> 46:48.154
Guess?

46:55.835 --> 46:58.599
Stringfellow's no name
for a kid like that.
