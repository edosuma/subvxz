WEBVTT

00:22.120 --> 00:23.800
See that warehouse over there?

00:26.200 --> 00:28.360
That's where I wanted to bring you.

00:31.800 --> 00:35.880
I had a reputation among my men because
I could smell fear like a dog smells meat.

00:38.920 --> 00:40.560
You look nervous, Vicente.

00:41.520 --> 00:45.360
We don't know each other that well, Otto.
I don't know if I can trust you.

00:47.280 --> 00:50.520
My father used to say that
a distrustful man lives for 200 years.

00:50.600 --> 00:54.160
-Hmm. Your father was a wise man.
-He was not.

00:54.240 --> 00:58.240
He was killed in the Great War because he
was overconfident at the Battle of Loos.

00:58.320 --> 01:00.240
They only needed one bullet.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.520
-Sorry to hear that.
-Don't be.

01:02.600 --> 01:05.480
It made me the way I am. Distrustful.

01:05.560 --> 01:07.040
And I've done all right.

01:10.640 --> 01:11.720
Do you mind?

01:13.840 --> 01:18.400
You know, in war, you learn that a man
is willing to hide his secrets…

01:20.080 --> 01:21.200
anywhere.

01:35.840 --> 01:36.800
Come in.

01:40.760 --> 01:41.800
Go ahead.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.560
Make yourself comfortable.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.040
Are you surprised?

02:11.320 --> 02:13.760
Would you like a drink?
Some liqueur? Wine?

02:13.840 --> 02:15.560
No, I have to be going.

02:15.640 --> 02:18.120
I don't want Vicente
waiting for me at the hotel.

02:18.920 --> 02:20.480
Your husband will be okay.

02:57.440 --> 02:59.520
I bought this place five years ago.

03:09.240 --> 03:11.880
They don't let anyone close to them,
only me.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.000
They are noble.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.680
But if they sense danger,
they'll kick you to death.

03:26.760 --> 03:28.240
What do you wanna do?

03:31.320 --> 03:32.560
You want me to kill him?

03:34.720 --> 03:35.960
You tell me.

03:45.640 --> 03:47.400
See how he looks at you?

03:48.760 --> 03:50.520
He doesn't know who you are.

03:51.720 --> 03:54.840
The best way for him
not to suffer is for him to trust you.

04:29.120 --> 04:30.560
Stay calm.

04:31.240 --> 04:35.000
Stay calm. Stay calm.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.840
That's how life works.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.400
Kill or be killed.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.280
It's too with animals

05:38.640 --> 05:40.080
as well as people.

05:50.160 --> 05:54.760
-You haven't answered my question.
-I don't know what you're talking about.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.080
Thank you, Amelia.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.520
You're not who you say you are.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.200
You try your best.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.320
You dress in nice clothes,
you engage in conversation…

06:08.320 --> 06:10.640
But there are things
you just don't improvise,

06:10.720 --> 06:12.960
like the way you pick up a glass of wine.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.560
When you come from a family with status,

06:20.640 --> 06:23.440
there are skills that you learn
before you get married.

06:23.960 --> 06:25.000
Mmm.

06:25.080 --> 06:28.000
Uh, good manners, of course.
Basic etiquette.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.160
The liturgy of marriage.

06:32.440 --> 06:34.280
I know who you really are.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.960
You're a survivor.

06:44.640 --> 06:46.160
I am a survivor too.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.640
Vicente doesn't know
who you really are, does he?

06:49.720 --> 06:52.440
The two of us had no choice
but to lie to survive.

06:52.960 --> 06:56.520
I managed to marry Otto because
a Spanish friend was able to arrange it.

06:57.280 --> 07:00.840
At the Escorial. It was a small ceremony…

07:08.040 --> 07:12.000
-It was unthinkable for a divorcée--
-If you'll excuse me, I need to get back.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.400
Oh, sorry. It's my back.

07:18.480 --> 07:22.240
The doctor told me I have to swim,
and I do it every day.

07:22.760 --> 07:26.360
But what I really like
is swimming in the sea, you know?

07:26.440 --> 07:27.640
I'm sorry.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.360
Isabel,

07:35.160 --> 07:37.480
due to the circumstances of life,

07:37.560 --> 07:40.000
I don't have many true friends,
you understand?

07:42.680 --> 07:45.320
If you and I are going to be friends,

07:45.400 --> 07:49.960
you have to promise me
that this is your only secret.

07:52.320 --> 07:53.600
I have no secrets.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.920
Stop the car. Stop the car!

08:42.520 --> 08:44.560
When I was imprisoned in Dachau,

08:46.200 --> 08:48.120
I dreamed of a big green lemon tree,

08:48.200 --> 08:51.520
planted by the door of a white house,
that provided lots of shade.

08:52.560 --> 08:55.880
I had plenty of time to think
about what that dream could mean.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.520
Then I remembered…

09:00.720 --> 09:02.720
that in the orphanage where I grew up,

09:03.560 --> 09:04.960
there was a lemon tree too.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.560
Nobody took care of it,
and yet it was alive.

09:09.440 --> 09:10.680
Bearing fruit.

09:12.080 --> 09:15.520
And I remembered
that one time, I asked the parish priest

09:15.600 --> 09:19.200
why God didn't make
the lemon tree bear oranges.

09:21.200 --> 09:24.360
He told me that that was
irrefutable proof God existed,

09:24.440 --> 09:27.160
because without God,
everything would be chaos.

09:30.600 --> 09:32.720
When they imprisoned me in Dachau…

09:34.880 --> 09:36.040
I was actually a priest.

09:42.120 --> 09:44.560
And they tried
to make us deny our faith.

09:45.720 --> 09:48.440
But we felt that the Lord was testing us.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.160
I saw many men die there.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.200
When they finally liberated Dachau,

09:57.440 --> 09:59.440
and I saw all that chaos,

10:01.120 --> 10:03.440
I asked myself where God was.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.280
There is no truth.

10:17.840 --> 10:18.880
There is no God.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.600
Only the expression of life.

10:32.480 --> 10:35.600
You know, Isabel, I think
we're the only ones who still believe

10:37.120 --> 10:38.200
that perhaps,

10:39.680 --> 10:42.680
someday,
the lemon tree might bear oranges.

10:44.920 --> 10:45.760
Am I right?

10:49.280 --> 10:50.280
Let's go.

10:50.360 --> 10:53.880
THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL
A FILM BY LUIS BUÑUEL

11:02.720 --> 11:05.480
None of the guys in the group
know about my past.

11:10.960 --> 11:11.800
Comrades.

11:11.880 --> 11:12.960
Eh?

11:18.080 --> 11:21.120
-Lucena isn't here?
-He was supposed to come with you.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.400
What happened?

11:23.480 --> 11:25.080
He had to go with Bachmann.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.480
Alone? Where to?

11:26.560 --> 11:28.760
I don't know, Deaf Man. No idea.

12:07.480 --> 12:09.600
Lucena.

12:12.160 --> 12:13.200
We're in.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.240
Yeah!

12:16.160 --> 12:18.560
Hell, yeah!

12:21.160 --> 12:22.240
A NETFLIX SERIES

13:21.160 --> 13:24.040
-Come on, gentlemen. Let's eat.
-Four of a kind, kings.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.480
-Lucena, that's not enough food.
-Let's eat!

13:27.040 --> 13:28.160
Pass the plate.

13:29.120 --> 13:31.080
He wants to take his products
to Portugal by train.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.760
-What kind of products?
-I don't know yet.

13:32.840 --> 13:33.880
How? And when?

13:33.960 --> 13:36.400
How can we help him take
anything to Portugal if it's all a lie?

13:36.480 --> 13:39.200
It doesn't matter. We're not doing it.
By the time he's figured it out,

13:39.280 --> 13:41.440
-we'll have captured Heim.
-What's the next step?

13:41.520 --> 13:43.280
We have a meeting
at the Gran Club. Isabel.

13:43.360 --> 13:44.840
What's the Gran Club?

13:44.920 --> 13:46.560
The most influential brotherhood in Spain.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.680
EPISODE 3 - THE GRAN CLUB

13:47.760 --> 13:49.000
Much more than the Masons.

13:49.080 --> 13:51.840
It's mostly made up of military
from the reserve.

13:51.920 --> 13:55.000
But I guess Bachmann
has invited you there because--

13:55.080 --> 13:57.640
-Because he trusts us.
-If he gives up his contacts,

13:57.720 --> 14:00.400
we'll know every move he makes
when he goes to help Heim.

14:01.640 --> 14:05.040
FIVE DAYS
UNTIL THE ARRIVAL OF ARIBERT HEIM

14:19.040 --> 14:19.960
Good afternoon.

14:20.040 --> 14:23.040
How are you? I'm Gunter,
Herr Bachmann's assistant.

14:23.120 --> 14:25.200
He's asked me to receive you personally.

14:26.320 --> 14:29.600
-Where's Mr. Bachmann?
-He is waiting for you inside.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.880
If you don't mind…

14:44.120 --> 14:46.120
It's just a formality, of course.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.240
-Orders from Herr Bachmann.
-Okay.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.240
-Madam, if I may…
-What?

14:54.000 --> 14:55.080
You're not touching me.

14:58.040 --> 15:01.160
Ah, of course. My apologies, Madam.

15:01.240 --> 15:02.720
Enjoy your evening.

15:02.800 --> 15:03.640
Thank you.

15:08.560 --> 15:10.640
-What was that?
-What was what?

15:11.200 --> 15:13.240
Why'd you bring a gun?
Wanna get us killed?

15:13.320 --> 15:15.080
I won't surrender without a fight.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.040
What are you doing there?

15:21.680 --> 15:23.960
Come in! Vicente, Isabel.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.520
How are we, eh?

15:30.800 --> 15:32.080
Aah!

15:32.160 --> 15:34.280
Did you have any trouble getting in?

15:34.360 --> 15:36.520
Your assistant was
quite affectionate with us..

15:36.600 --> 15:38.920
Gunter is very protective of me.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.360
SPAIN

16:18.400 --> 16:20.560
TO THE FALLEN

16:31.800 --> 16:33.640
NO POSSIBLE RELIEF, UNTIL EXTINCTION

16:33.720 --> 16:35.320
We are paying tribute.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.960
Many of your compatriots
gave their lives for the German cause.

16:39.480 --> 16:42.200
Today we remember the fallen
from the Blue Division.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.240
Some things shouldn't be forgotten.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.120
No one should forget their dead.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.040
Thank you for the invitation.

16:58.120 --> 16:59.680
This is a beautiful place.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.680
Aah, don't be fooled, Isabel.

17:01.760 --> 17:04.560
Only people with mustaches
are listened to around here.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.760
They only talk
about politics and business.

17:06.840 --> 17:08.200
You know what they say.

17:08.800 --> 17:09.920
Arbeit macht frei.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.920
Work makes you free.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.840
The things you say sometimes!

17:14.440 --> 17:16.600
Come, Vicente,
I want to introduce you to someone.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.400
We'll be right back, ladies.

17:19.320 --> 17:22.480
See? Off they go. How quickly they forget.

17:23.560 --> 17:27.880
Although, if I'm honest, I don't remember
why I got married, either.

17:28.840 --> 17:29.920
Can I pour you a drink?

17:30.520 --> 17:31.400
Sure.

17:31.920 --> 17:35.680
The colonel has sorted out the crossing
of the Strait of Gibraltar from Tarifa,

17:35.760 --> 17:37.480
but he needs to get the weapons there.

17:37.560 --> 17:39.040
May I ask where they're from?

17:39.120 --> 17:41.160
The Moors won't care where they come from,

17:41.240 --> 17:44.120
as long as they can kill each other.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.040
I'm sure they won't,

17:45.120 --> 17:48.000
but if I'm going to carry them,
I'd like to know what I'm risking.

17:48.840 --> 17:53.040
Let's just say that the last shipment
bound for Madrid dropped some boxes.

17:53.560 --> 17:55.480
Carrying how many?

17:56.160 --> 17:59.160
-Six hundred like this one.
-Hidden among my meat.

18:02.440 --> 18:03.480
Is there a problem?

18:05.760 --> 18:09.480
No. No problem. But I would like
to look into it so there aren't any later.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.040
I'm sure Vicente
will know how to deal with it.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.600
If not, he wouldn't have come here, right?

18:19.520 --> 18:22.680
Well, is that everything?
We need to get ready.

18:23.280 --> 18:24.320
All right, then.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.480
All right.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.040
Mr. Bachmann, your call.

18:34.120 --> 18:35.760
I had it put through to the billiard room.

18:37.160 --> 18:38.200
Excuse me.

18:56.560 --> 18:59.120
-Excuse me, Ilse, where's the washroom?
-I'll show you.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.920
-No. I'd prefer a little privacy.
-Of course.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.240
-At the end of the second corridor.
-Thanks.

19:32.840 --> 19:33.760
LADIES

19:48.960 --> 19:50.760
I can't fit, so…

20:14.160 --> 20:16.560
Excellent. We'll wait for you.

20:17.080 --> 20:17.960
Of course.

20:18.480 --> 20:21.680
Let him know that it's an honor to help.

20:29.360 --> 20:34.120
If anything happens to me, send this to
Archbishop Alois Hudal in Grottaferrata.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.520
He'll know what to do.

20:44.800 --> 20:45.840
Isabel?

20:47.280 --> 20:48.960
Isabel, is everything all right?

21:00.280 --> 21:02.240
I'm just afraid she might have fainted.

21:09.400 --> 21:10.320
Isabel.

21:11.360 --> 21:14.120
-Ilse.
-I was worried. I knocked on the door,

21:14.200 --> 21:16.600
-but you didn't answer.
-Sorry. I just need to eat something.

21:27.960 --> 21:29.800
Important calls are made
from the Gran Club.

21:29.880 --> 21:32.080
That's why we couldn't get anything
from his office phone.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.720
They were cautious because
they were talking about Heim.

21:34.800 --> 21:38.560
He didn't mention any names.
I only heard him say they'd wait for him.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.840
Then he wrote something down
and gave it to his assistant.

21:41.920 --> 21:44.440
It's either Heim or another Nazi.
So what's the problem?

21:44.520 --> 21:47.240
-He could be any old German businessman.
-Yeah.

21:47.320 --> 21:48.400
You serious?

21:48.480 --> 21:50.480
-Yes.
-This is Bachmann. It must be a Nazi.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.880
No, we're here for Heim.
I want you stuck to the phone.

21:52.960 --> 21:55.280
You two go with Bachmann.
Follow him, don't lose him.

21:55.360 --> 21:58.000
Any movement could help us
figure out who it is they're waiting for.

21:59.080 --> 21:59.920
And?

22:01.080 --> 22:02.640
And we'll keep up this charade.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.120
-Kiddo.
-Jesus.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.960
-Old man.
-How was your night?

22:31.800 --> 22:33.560
Nothing. They haven't been outside.

22:38.280 --> 22:40.760
-You'll need it.
-Thanks.

22:40.840 --> 22:43.160
-You left this.
-Huh?

22:43.960 --> 22:45.480
-Your fruit.
-You can keep it.

24:13.000 --> 24:15.400
Where the hell are you going this late?

24:58.680 --> 25:00.440
Why did you stop?

25:24.200 --> 25:25.440
Shit!

26:09.000 --> 26:10.400
I'm sorry, I lost them.

26:10.480 --> 26:12.880
-Was Ilse with him?
-Yeah. Bachmann was driving.

26:12.960 --> 26:16.000
-Where were they going?
-I don't know, Lucena. No idea.

26:30.120 --> 26:32.560
Yes. A message for Mrs. Ramos.

26:33.280 --> 26:37.040
They left at daybreak. I'll be waiting
for instructions in front of Tythus.

27:23.280 --> 27:24.360
Thank you, Amelia.

27:26.560 --> 27:28.680
The maid says they'll be away
for a few days.

27:28.760 --> 27:30.920
Early for a vacation,
don't you think, Lucena?

27:31.000 --> 27:34.480
-We need to know where they went.
-Why did they leave? Huh?

27:34.560 --> 27:36.240
We should get out
of this apartment.

27:36.320 --> 27:38.160
-No! We have to wait.
-For what?

27:38.240 --> 27:39.880
-Information.
-Information?

27:39.960 --> 27:42.240
Who the fuck's passing us information,
Lucena?

27:42.320 --> 27:44.840
-We're the ones risking our lives here!
-Enough.

27:44.920 --> 27:47.320
-Why not talk to them directly?
-It's not that simple.

27:47.400 --> 27:50.600
What's the information? What if Bachmann
suspects you and knows who we are?

27:50.680 --> 27:53.200
-What if he's seen me?
-We can't stay together.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.120
-Are we staying?
-We'll be okay.

27:55.200 --> 27:58.200
-If they find out, they'll kill all of us.
-Don't you understand?

27:58.280 --> 28:01.120
Doubt will get us killed quicker
than anything else, Isabel.

28:02.560 --> 28:06.120
We're going to hear something soon,
I know it. They've never failed me.

28:06.640 --> 28:09.520
They've never failed me, damn it.
I won't fail you, either.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.680
I know what I'm asking you to do.

28:14.120 --> 28:16.440
I'm very sorry, but you have to trust me.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.080
What was that?

28:35.880 --> 28:36.960
What was what?

29:31.400 --> 29:33.120
Will you tell me what's going on?

29:36.200 --> 29:38.440
Do you think they know who we are? Lucena!

30:26.000 --> 30:27.120
-Hey! Where is it?
-What?

30:27.200 --> 30:29.040
-Where?
-I don't know what you're talking about!

30:29.120 --> 30:32.040
-What were you doing in my room?
-I only went upstairs to serve dinner!

30:32.120 --> 30:35.520
I haven't been in your room, I swear!
I don't know what you want!

30:41.520 --> 30:42.600
Forget it. Here.

30:43.120 --> 30:44.640
I'm sorry.

30:45.160 --> 30:46.160
I'm sorry.

30:52.400 --> 30:55.160
It took a long time
before I could trust anyone.

30:56.360 --> 30:57.960
In the camp, I was alone.

30:59.720 --> 31:01.560
There was no place for trust there.

31:02.440 --> 31:03.400
And outside…

31:04.320 --> 31:05.200
Outside, I…

31:06.320 --> 31:08.400
Do you know when I trusted someone again?

31:08.480 --> 31:11.760
When I realized those three guys
had gone through the same thing I had.

31:14.520 --> 31:17.000
It's like a thread that binds
all of us together.

31:17.080 --> 31:21.280
You can't see it. It's too fine.
But it's impossible to break.

31:22.800 --> 31:25.160
Because you know
they'll never let you be alone.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.480
That was almost a year ago.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.320
Now I think it's the only thing
that keeps me from losing my mind.

31:34.400 --> 31:36.040
To have someone by your side.

31:38.160 --> 31:41.840
We take care of each other.
In our own way, but we do.

31:43.800 --> 31:46.160
When you make a decision,
you have to make it for the group,

31:46.240 --> 31:48.520
even if you have to put
your own life on the line.

31:48.600 --> 31:52.360
It's not easy, but it's the only way
to keep this group together and alive.

31:54.280 --> 31:56.840
Like a family.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.040
-Yes?
-Mr. De Vega?

32:08.120 --> 32:09.840
-Yes.
-This is the front desk.

32:09.920 --> 32:12.400
They're waiting for you in
the conference room on the mezzanine.

32:12.480 --> 32:14.200
-Who?
-I don't know, sir.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.960
-That's all they told me.
-But tell me--

32:18.080 --> 32:19.960
Who was it?

32:20.080 --> 32:21.840
I don't know.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.040
Don't go.

32:27.280 --> 32:28.480
-I'll come with you.
-No.

32:29.680 --> 32:33.040
Stay here. If I'm not back in ten minutes,
go with the rest of them.

32:33.120 --> 32:35.880
Call the number I gave to Marsé
and finish the job.

32:39.360 --> 32:40.920
Isabel…

32:42.160 --> 32:43.600
I trust you.

33:18.320 --> 33:19.280
Ramos!

33:22.640 --> 33:25.080
What happened?
Why'd you miss our appointment?

33:25.160 --> 33:28.000
-Bachmann's disappeared and no one know--
-Shh.

33:30.560 --> 33:35.080
There's a small mountain village
near Burgos. It's called Batride.

33:35.600 --> 33:38.880
In Batride,
there is a Franciscan monastery.

33:39.480 --> 33:41.320
And it seems that, a few days ago,

33:41.400 --> 33:44.800
some farmers there saw a monk
that none of them had seen before.

33:44.880 --> 33:48.760
They were struck by his height.
Well over six feet tall.

33:49.560 --> 33:52.960
And… he said goodbye in German.

33:54.240 --> 33:55.200
Aribert Heim.

33:57.080 --> 33:59.320
Well, she will have to confirm that.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.400
But that's why she's with us, right?

34:08.320 --> 34:09.960
If the man who left the monastery is Heim,

34:10.040 --> 34:12.640
Bachmann must've gone to meet him,
which explains his disappearance.

34:12.720 --> 34:14.920
-Anything we didn't know?
-We're back where we were.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.920
We didn't know
he had a right-hand man.

34:17.000 --> 34:18.880
His assistant has to know where he's gone.

34:18.960 --> 34:20.080
Mm-hm.

34:22.800 --> 34:24.840
You said Bachmann gave his assistant
a piece of paper.

34:24.920 --> 34:26.880
If something happened,
he was to give it to…

34:26.960 --> 34:30.200
-Hudal.
-Archbishop Hudal? Alois Hudal?

34:30.280 --> 34:33.440
-Who's that?
-The Church is always involved.

34:33.520 --> 34:36.040
He's the guy who helped
Adolf Eichmann, Josef Mengele,

34:36.120 --> 34:38.080
Klaus Barbie, Gustav Wagner escape.

34:38.160 --> 34:41.800
-Wirh many other illustrious squareheads.
-A real son of a bitch.

34:42.320 --> 34:45.200
-You speak clearly when you want.
-If Bachmann ordered this, it's because

34:45.280 --> 34:49.240
that paper contains important information
about Heim's possible escape plan.

34:49.320 --> 34:51.920
-Deaf Man, Castro, go get the assistant.
-Great.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.800
Oh! Whew!

37:17.400 --> 37:19.800
You wanna play?

37:29.160 --> 37:30.160
Let's do it.

39:23.120 --> 39:25.120
-Who are you?
-Where's your boss?

39:27.440 --> 39:31.880
You all smell the same.
Jews, Gypsies, Spaniards…

39:35.760 --> 39:38.680
Your boss, Otto Bachmann, where is he?

39:39.280 --> 39:42.320
I don't know. Aren't you two close?

39:47.320 --> 39:49.280
For a goddamn Nazi, you're pretty funny,

39:49.360 --> 39:51.600
-but I don't like being laughed at.
-Oh, no?

39:52.680 --> 39:55.840
Well, we were all pretty amused
during the war.

39:55.920 --> 39:57.040
The war?

39:58.080 --> 40:00.160
In the war, you taught us a thing or two.

40:01.080 --> 40:02.200
You taught us how to survive,

40:02.280 --> 40:04.760
and that pain is a great way
to loosen someone's tongue.

40:05.360 --> 40:07.360
Where's Bachmann's paper? Where is it?

40:08.240 --> 40:09.560
Where is he? Is he with Heim?

40:10.600 --> 40:14.000
It's too bad we didn't kill
every last one of you.

40:14.080 --> 40:17.640
Yeah, it's a pity. You know why?
Because if you had killed me,

40:17.720 --> 40:20.800
I wouldn't be here, and you wouldn't be
about to eat your fucking teeth.

40:26.840 --> 40:29.040
-I don't know anything!
-Do you mind?

40:29.560 --> 40:32.960
-Go, Deaf Man.
-I don't know anything! Please!

40:34.160 --> 40:36.680
Castro, your turn.
What a crappy hand.

40:37.480 --> 40:38.920
What are you going to do?

40:39.520 --> 40:41.680
-Has he said anything?
-The Gran Club's lockers.

40:41.760 --> 40:43.560
That's where we'll find
the piece of paper.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.360
If you go in there, they'll kill you.

40:47.440 --> 40:51.320
-Did I ask your opinion?
-What are you gonna do with him?

40:54.440 --> 40:56.040
We'll do whatever we have to.

41:14.480 --> 41:17.520
What if we get caught?
How will we get out of the Gran Club?

41:18.440 --> 41:19.480
You're not coming.

41:19.560 --> 41:20.960
I survived the war too.

41:21.040 --> 41:23.600
If you hadn't appeared,
Bachmann wouldn't be a problem.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.520
I've proven I can handle myself.

43:04.560 --> 43:05.480
Call it.

43:07.160 --> 43:08.320
Heads.

43:18.600 --> 43:19.520
Give me your gun.

43:36.560 --> 43:37.400
Right.

43:39.640 --> 43:40.760
Get him out of there.

43:58.680 --> 44:00.960
When was the last time I saw you?

44:01.040 --> 44:02.160
Three years ago--

44:02.240 --> 44:04.240
Yes, that's right! Three years ago.

44:05.400 --> 44:08.760
But you still live in the same place?
How do you like it?

45:10.800 --> 45:12.680
"Santa Tecla P1-1."

45:19.600 --> 45:21.120
What are you doing here?

45:25.120 --> 45:26.600
I asked you a question.

45:28.360 --> 45:29.440
This is not the first time

45:29.520 --> 45:32.120
-someone's pointed a gun at me.
-Who the hell are you?

45:32.200 --> 45:34.160
Let's go.

45:43.440 --> 45:45.240
Drop the gun. Drop the gun!

45:56.120 --> 45:57.080
-Move!
-Come on!

46:19.000 --> 46:20.160
You okay?

46:20.760 --> 46:22.120
-You?
-Yes.

46:22.960 --> 46:23.920
That's the way out.

46:26.160 --> 46:27.600
Cover me.

47:16.520 --> 47:18.760
Let me go, please.

47:19.600 --> 47:20.840
Let me go.

47:32.840 --> 47:33.800
He's in Almería.

47:34.960 --> 47:36.400
I swear he's in Almería.

47:37.720 --> 47:40.280
I don't want to die.
Please, I don't want to die…

47:40.360 --> 47:42.280
Do you know Matthew 5:38?

47:43.920 --> 47:45.440
"You have heard that it was said,

47:46.600 --> 47:49.000
'An eye for an eye,
and a tooth for a tooth.'"

47:51.320 --> 47:55.440
"But I say to you, do not resist
an evildoer if they strike your cheek…

47:57.160 --> 47:58.760
turn the other also."

47:58.840 --> 48:02.120
"And if anyone
wants to sue you and take your coat…

48:05.320 --> 48:06.880
give your cloak as well."

48:06.960 --> 48:10.440
"And if anyone forces you
to go one mile, go also the second one."

48:13.840 --> 48:15.520
"Give to those who beg."

48:15.600 --> 48:18.280
"And do not refuse anyone
who wants to borrow from you."

48:18.360 --> 48:21.520
"But I say to you, love your enemies
and pray for those who persecute you,

48:21.600 --> 48:23.080
so that you may be children…"

48:26.720 --> 48:29.120
"Children of your Father in heaven."

48:32.240 --> 48:35.880
"For he is the one who makes his sun rise
on the evil and on the good…

48:39.080 --> 48:41.680
and sends rain on the righteous
and unrighteous."

48:43.440 --> 48:47.160
And now, according to the word of God,
I'm supposed to let you go.

48:47.880 --> 48:48.960
But the problem…

48:53.120 --> 48:56.080
But the problem is that
because of people like you…

48:58.320 --> 49:00.240
I stopped believing in God.

49:01.320 --> 49:02.240
No…
