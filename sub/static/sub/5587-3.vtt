ADULT ADAM: <i> Back in the '80s,</i>
<i> before you could film</i>

00:02.003 --> 00:03.402
<i> a major motion picture</i>
<i> with your phone,</i>

00:03.404 --> 00:04.903
<i> the only way</i>
<i> to capture memories</i>

00:04.905 --> 00:08.407
<i> was with this monstrosity.</i>
<i> The video camera.</i>

00:08.409 --> 00:10.609
<i> It was literally</i>
<i> backbreaking work,</i>

00:10.611 --> 00:13.512
<i> but the result</i>
<i> was always priceless.</i>

00:13.514 --> 00:14.380
What's up, B-ball fans?

00:14.382 --> 00:17.583
Big Tasty coming to you live
from the drive.

00:17.585 --> 00:18.851
Rumor has it
you like dunks.

00:18.853 --> 00:23.055
Well, I call this one
"slam, jam, thank you, ma'am."

00:23.057 --> 00:24.690
ALL: Oh!

00:25.926 --> 00:28.160
"Honey, I dunked the kid."

00:28.162 --> 00:29.595
ALL: Oh!

00:29.597 --> 00:32.231
"Good morning, Viet-slam."

00:32.333 --> 00:34.033
ALL: Oh!

00:35.002 --> 00:35.968
ALL: Ooh!

00:35.970 --> 00:38.203
<i> Call me Jean-Claude Van Jam.</i>

00:38.205 --> 00:41.140
BOYS: <i> Oh!</i>
(LAUGHTER)

00:41.142 --> 00:43.375
What?
(BOYS WHOOPING)

00:43.377 --> 00:44.510
This is the worst thing
I've ever seen,

00:44.512 --> 00:46.211
and I see my dad
in his underpants
every day.

00:46.213 --> 00:50.382
But we're only
halfway through watching
my Jampilation...

00:50.384 --> 00:50.983
The extrava-jam-za.

00:50.985 --> 00:52.985
Yeah, this has been amazing,
you know,

00:52.987 --> 00:54.153
a Saturday
really well spent,

00:54.155 --> 00:56.488
but I am gonna go do
anything else.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.490
(ALL CHEERING)

00:58.626 --> 01:02.728
BEVERLY: <i> Aah! It's my little</i>
<i> love muffin's birthday!</i>

01:03.030 --> 01:05.597
Dude, did you tape over
your 5th birthday party?

01:05.599 --> 01:06.698
That could have been
anyone's parents.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.767
No, I remember that party...
Your mom gave me a haircut.

01:08.769 --> 01:11.537
'Cause she said my mom
did a bad job.

01:12.006 --> 01:14.440
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:14.442 --> 01:16.041
Yes! This is wonderful!

01:16.043 --> 01:19.078
For me. For you,
it's like as bad as it gets.

01:19.080 --> 01:19.578
It's fine!

01:19.580 --> 01:21.280
Mom has millions
of tapes of us.

01:21.282 --> 01:23.849
It's not like
she has every one
of them memorized.

01:23.851 --> 01:24.883
Hi, love nuggets.

01:24.885 --> 01:26.952
Oh, your 5th birthday!

01:26.954 --> 01:30.155
Oh, I remember
every single moment.

01:30.157 --> 01:31.657
We should go.
No, no. Stay.

01:31.659 --> 01:34.026
Let's all watch
the best time in my life

01:34.028 --> 01:35.461
when you were
my Little Schmoo

01:35.463 --> 01:38.197
and you used to give mama
endless huggies.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.499
You heard mama.
Play the tape.

01:42.069 --> 01:43.202
Why watch an old video

01:43.204 --> 01:46.271
when you can get
a real huggie right now?

01:46.273 --> 01:47.406
For real?

01:47.408 --> 01:49.208
Get in here, you.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.075
(LAUGHS)

01:50.077 --> 01:52.010
Ohh,
ain't this the best?

01:52.012 --> 01:52.611
Totally.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.647
I can really feel
your whole body
against mine.

01:55.649 --> 01:59.318
BEVERLY: Oh, my baby's
so big and squishy.

02:00.588 --> 02:01.820
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:01.822 --> 02:06.758
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

02:08.095 --> 02:09.061
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

02:09.063 --> 02:13.665
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:13.667 --> 02:16.001
ADULT ADAM: <i> It was October 7,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

02:16.003 --> 02:18.604
<i> and my dad was engaged</i>
<i> in his favorite hobby...</i>

02:18.606 --> 02:20.172
<i> Watching the weather channel.</i>

02:20.174 --> 02:22.374
<i> Back then, there were only</i>
<i> five channels to watch.</i>

02:22.376 --> 02:24.743
<i> With the invention</i>
<i> of this exciting network,</i>

02:24.745 --> 02:27.112
<i> dads across America</i>
<i> were hooked.</i>

02:27.114 --> 02:27.813
Call cousin Arnie.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.448
They have a blizzard
warning in Denver!

02:29.450 --> 02:32.584
They have no idea
what they're up against!

02:32.586 --> 02:33.919
Unless it banks south.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.622
Then they'll just have nice,
mild flurries.

02:36.624 --> 02:40.125
Ooh. My knee is acting up.

02:40.127 --> 02:41.426
Bet it's gonna rain.

02:41.428 --> 02:42.127
(LAUGHING) Oh!

02:42.129 --> 02:45.564
This guy thinks
it's gonna rain today
with 5% humidity.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.499
I liked you better
when you hated everything.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.234
ADULT ADAM: <i> Yep, the weather</i>
<i> was my dad's hobby.</i>

02:49.236 --> 02:52.104
<i> And of course, it couldn't be</i>
<i> any more different than mine.</i>

02:52.106 --> 02:53.138
Okay, here's the deal.
(CLICK)

02:53.140 --> 02:55.908
You're looking at
a sentient robot
named Johnny 5

02:55.910 --> 02:57.209
from the hit movie
<i> Short Circuit</i>

02:57.211 --> 02:59.711
and the less critically
acclaimed <i> Short Circuit 2.</i>

02:59.713 --> 03:01.747
Why is the robit lounging
on a raft?

03:01.749 --> 03:03.081
That thing weighs a ton.
It makes no sense.

03:03.083 --> 03:06.885
The point is,
The Hobby Shop is selling
a limited-edition kit

03:06.887 --> 03:09.888
to build a mini replica
Johnny 5 and I need money.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.357
You do realize
I'm gonna say no, right?

03:12.359 --> 03:13.759
I do know that, yes.

03:13.761 --> 03:14.660
And that's why
I'm gonna call this

03:14.662 --> 03:18.530
a learning-based project
and ask you to build it
with me.

03:18.532 --> 03:22.234
Do not do that.
Do not call it a
learning-based project.

03:22.236 --> 03:22.901
Then give me the money.

03:22.903 --> 03:26.305
I won't involve mom,
and we can each go
our separate ways.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.706
Done. How much?

03:27.708 --> 03:28.106
$96.

03:28.108 --> 03:29.474
I'm gonna ask you
to go away now.

03:29.476 --> 03:31.076
Mom, I have
a learning-based project

03:31.078 --> 03:33.412
dad won't
get involved in!

03:33.414 --> 03:36.181
What is this about
a learning-based project?

03:36.183 --> 03:37.282
I like
the sound of that.

03:37.284 --> 03:39.084
I want to build a robot
with dad,

03:39.086 --> 03:40.619
but he doesn't want to
do it with me.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.555
Murray!
It's a learning-based
project!

03:43.557 --> 03:45.857
Mama, why won't he let me
learn stuff?

03:45.859 --> 03:47.593
It's a learning-based
project!

03:47.595 --> 03:49.461
The thing
costs 100 bucks.

03:49.463 --> 03:52.130
Tell you what...
Instead of going to the store

03:52.132 --> 03:53.498
and buying a bunch
of robot parts,

03:53.500 --> 03:56.702
dad will help you build one
from junk around the house.

03:56.704 --> 03:57.603
Oh, no,
what have I done?

03:57.605 --> 04:00.272
I was literally
just sitting here.
No. Zip it.

04:00.274 --> 04:01.506
Zip it. Zip it.
I've made up my mind.

04:01.508 --> 04:04.610
You two are building a robot,
and that's final!

04:04.612 --> 04:07.713
Yay!
Learning-based project!

04:08.382 --> 04:08.947
Yeah, I'm a putz.

04:08.949 --> 04:11.383
ADULT ADAM:
<i> While I was stuck with the</i>
<i> grumpiest man on the planet,</i>

04:11.385 --> 04:13.952
<i> Barry went to</i>
<i> the smartest man he knew.</i>

04:13.954 --> 04:15.754
Coach Meller! Coach!

04:15.756 --> 04:17.089
I need your help.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.657
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

04:18.659 --> 04:19.391
Third graders, out!

04:19.393 --> 04:21.693
You're of no use to me
until you develop adult bodies

04:21.695 --> 04:24.062
that can play something
besides tag.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.430
What are we looking at here,
Goldberg?

04:25.432 --> 04:26.832
I taped over
my 5th birthday party!

04:26.834 --> 04:30.269
My mom will never forgive me
if I can't get her tape back.

04:30.271 --> 04:33.005
You're the A.V. club adviser.
Help me.

04:33.007 --> 04:35.207
Well, it's more
of a ceremonial title.

04:35.209 --> 04:37.943
I just get to keep the key
to the A.V. closet on my belt,

04:37.945 --> 04:40.012
but mostly
I just hand the key off

04:40.014 --> 04:42.014
to that weird kid
with the muppet voice.

04:42.016 --> 04:44.983
My brother?
That's him... Muppet boy.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.118
So is it possible?

04:46.120 --> 04:47.586
Can we un-film
what I taped over?

04:47.588 --> 04:50.789
Absolutely.
All we got to do is pop
that tape into the VCR,

04:50.791 --> 04:52.557
hit record and rewind
at the same time,

04:52.559 --> 04:56.228
and it will un-record
the top layer of video.

04:56.297 --> 04:56.728
Duh!

04:56.730 --> 04:58.897
The answer was in
front of me the whole time.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.832
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Except that wasn't the answer.</i>

05:00.834 --> 05:01.600
To the nerd hole.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.702
ADULT ADAM: <i> While you could</i>
<i> easily tape over something,</i>

05:03.704 --> 05:05.237
<i> you could never un-erase it.</i>

05:05.239 --> 05:08.540
(GRINDING)
(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

05:10.544 --> 05:11.510
No!
Why didn't it work?

05:11.512 --> 05:14.513
'Cause nobody really knows
how VHS technology works.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.248
It's a mystery
science can't solve.

05:16.250 --> 05:18.784
Looks like your only choice
is to come clean.

05:18.786 --> 05:21.787
Or I double-down
and keep lying.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.255
I lied
on a job application once

05:23.257 --> 05:27.059
and said I was proficient
in the audio-visual arts.

05:27.061 --> 05:28.260
Now here we are.

05:28.262 --> 05:30.095
So the lesson is...
Don't lie.

05:30.097 --> 05:32.230
Unless it gets you
an extra 60 bucks a week

05:32.232 --> 05:34.700
and a butt-load
of extension cords.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.668
I feel good about today.

05:36.670 --> 05:40.405
ADULT ADAM:
<i> In my brother's mind, there</i>
<i> was only one logical choice...</i>

05:40.407 --> 05:41.773
<i> Frame my mom.</i>

05:41.775 --> 05:43.675
<i> First, he took</i>
<i> his ruined birthday tape</i>

05:43.677 --> 05:44.609
<i> and steamed off the label.</i>

05:44.611 --> 05:47.512
<i> Next, he stuck it onto</i>
<i> my mom's Phil Donahue tape</i>

05:47.514 --> 05:50.382
<i> so the next time</i>
<i> she'd watch Barry's birthday,</i>

05:50.384 --> 05:51.249
<i> she'd find this.</i>

05:51.251 --> 05:54.286
<i> In the long-term,</i>
<i> it's not good for us.</i>

05:54.655 --> 05:58.156
I just don't understand
how I could be so careless!

05:58.158 --> 05:59.391
Don't beat yourself up
too bad.

05:59.393 --> 06:02.194
I mean, yeah,
it's an unforgivable mistake.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.795
But one day,
I'll recover.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.263
But I won't!

06:05.265 --> 06:06.932
Those were
the first moving images

06:06.934 --> 06:08.667
of my precious
love monkeys.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.969
Lost! Forever!

06:11.372 --> 06:13.572
Dude, I'm all for lying
to our parents,

06:13.574 --> 06:14.706
but this is
very not okay.

06:14.708 --> 06:18.176
The good news is
she'll totally forget
about it in a few days.

06:18.178 --> 06:19.611
I will never forget
about this!

06:19.613 --> 06:21.213
Or a few weeks.
Ever.

06:21.215 --> 06:22.180
Mom's a mess.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.682
I've failed as a mother...

06:23.684 --> 06:24.383
I can't take it, Barry.

06:24.385 --> 06:26.084
...as a woman...
Either you tell her...

06:26.086 --> 06:28.520
...and as a human person.
Or I will.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.622
This is all your fault,
Phil Donahue,

06:30.624 --> 06:33.492
you gorgeous
white-haired bastard.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.230
Okay,
brainstorming session.

06:38.232 --> 06:41.833
Murray, now that you've been
forced to build a robo-man,

06:41.835 --> 06:44.669
you get to delight
in Adam's favorite hobby.

06:44.671 --> 06:45.771
I was about to delight
in the weather channel.

06:45.773 --> 06:49.875
They got a new ticker
at the bottom of the screen.
It's always moving.

06:49.877 --> 06:50.642
Are we done here?
No!

06:50.644 --> 06:54.179
Come on. Tell me what this
metal-sucker should look like.

06:54.181 --> 06:56.615
Get the ball rolling,
Mur-Man.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.683
(WHISPERING)
I don't know. Um...

06:58.685 --> 07:01.420
It could have a...
Button.

07:01.422 --> 07:02.320
Good! A button.

07:02.322 --> 07:04.823
Way to go there, big guy.
Adam, your turn.

07:04.825 --> 07:07.826
It definitely should have
a back to the future-style

07:07.828 --> 07:09.694
flux capacitor
for time travel.

07:09.696 --> 07:10.395
Don't write that down.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.997
No time travel.
That's not a thing.

07:11.999 --> 07:15.500
There are no bad ideas
in brainstorming.

07:15.502 --> 07:16.835
What else you got?

07:16.837 --> 07:17.335
I don't know.

07:17.337 --> 07:19.704
Maybe like a pointy hand
that could poke stuff.

07:19.706 --> 07:20.605
An ion-based magma cannon.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.508
A hat.
A combat-ready
cloaking device.

07:23.510 --> 07:24.109
Metal feet.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.344
We should also
give it emotions
and a sense of humor.

07:26.346 --> 07:28.180
No!
Don't write that down!

07:28.182 --> 07:30.048
Ever heard
of <i> Short Circuit?</i>

07:30.050 --> 07:31.516
Once we get it struck
by lightning,

07:31.518 --> 07:34.052
it'll be alive
just like Johnny 5.

07:34.054 --> 07:34.686
That was a movie.

07:34.688 --> 07:38.089
For the sake of argument,
let's entertain the notion

07:38.091 --> 07:41.393
that this robot can have
anything we want it to have.

07:41.395 --> 07:43.428
That's what
I'm trying to do, bro,

07:43.430 --> 07:46.598
but unless this robot
can give fog advisories,

07:46.600 --> 07:48.633
my father
ain't getting onboard.

07:48.635 --> 07:49.835
A weather robit.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.536
Now, that actually
makes sense.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.371
I want this thing to have
a snow plow.

07:53.373 --> 07:55.106
And inter-dimensional
portals.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.242
Now we're cooking
with gas.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.678
ADULT ADAM: <i> While my dad and I</i>
<i> were finally coming together,</i>

07:59.680 --> 08:03.281
<i> my mom was</i>
<i> still falling apart.</i>

08:03.283 --> 08:04.816
Dude, look at her.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.651
She's even lost her will
to jazzercise.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.987
You were supposed to
tell her by now.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.822
I know,
but I have great news.

08:10.824 --> 08:15.327
I came up with something
so much better than the truth.

08:15.496 --> 08:17.562
I searched through
all our old tapes

08:17.564 --> 08:19.197
and cut together
Beverly Goldberg's

08:19.199 --> 08:21.566
most awesome moments
as a mom.

08:21.568 --> 08:23.535
I call it a Momtage.

08:23.537 --> 08:24.469
I don't understand.

08:24.471 --> 08:26.004
See,
I took the word "mom"

08:26.006 --> 08:27.873
and mushed it into
the word "montage,"

08:27.875 --> 08:29.574
which is Spanish
for the word "honesty."

08:29.576 --> 08:30.775
I know
what "montage" means.

08:30.777 --> 08:31.877
Just tell me
how it'll make her
feel better.

08:31.879 --> 08:36.314
Simple. There's nothing
that woman loves more than
taking care of us.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.349
When she watches
her greatest hits,

08:37.351 --> 08:40.752
she'll give me a hug
and forget all about
the other tape.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.387
(CLICK)

08:42.389 --> 08:44.356
<i> ¶ Never surrender ¶</i>

08:44.358 --> 08:46.892
BARRY: Momtage!

08:48.061 --> 08:50.362
Starring our mama.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.598
Chores!

08:55.469 --> 08:57.369
Living the dream!

08:58.171 --> 09:00.405
Cooking foods!

09:01.808 --> 09:04.376
Too hot, but thank you!

09:05.178 --> 09:07.512
Unclogging stuff!

09:08.549 --> 09:10.715
It was dad, not me!

09:11.718 --> 09:13.752
Giant hair!

09:14.488 --> 09:16.521
Fashion icon!

09:19.259 --> 09:21.726
Yelling about safety!

09:22.796 --> 09:25.730
We heart Beverly!

09:30.437 --> 09:32.070
Well?
Good stuff, right?

09:32.072 --> 09:33.572
Yeah, I'm going to
tell her myself,

09:33.574 --> 09:35.740
because this will literally
send her into madness.

09:35.742 --> 09:40.645
Why can't you trust me
that for once I make
things better?

09:40.647 --> 09:42.247
BEVERLY:
<i> You did it Cchmoo-Barry!</i>

09:42.249 --> 09:44.049
<i> You went on the big potty!</i>

09:44.051 --> 09:46.217
<i> We'll remember this forever.</i>

09:46.219 --> 09:47.686
No!
That's why!

09:47.688 --> 09:50.188
Because you taped over
another priceless memory!

09:50.190 --> 09:54.092
Chill!
I can fix this
with another Momtage.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.896
ADULT ADAM: <i> It had been</i>
<i> two days since my dad</i>
<i> came aboard</i>

09:57.898 --> 10:01.633
<i> my greatest hobby,</i>
<i> and the results were epic!</i>

10:01.635 --> 10:02.500
Big news!

10:02.502 --> 10:03.768
I got a tin of rugelach.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.337
You two look like
you could use a break.

10:05.339 --> 10:08.673
No breaks.
We're on a roll.
Check it out.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.742
Here's our robot
in killer cyborg form.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.711
Here he is shooting
his laser-guided fist.

10:12.713 --> 10:17.315
And here he is using
a doppler radar
to predict black ice.

10:17.317 --> 10:20.118
Hoo-hoo!
Can you imagine?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.621
Now let's get to work.
On what?

10:22.623 --> 10:23.521
Duh. Our robot.

10:23.523 --> 10:26.725
Sure, it won't be easy,
but you said you'd tinker.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.393
We can't build
this thing.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.128
It's got
a time-travel thingy.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.364
This technology
doesn't even exist!

10:32.366 --> 10:33.932
Not with that attitude.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.000
Okay, it's on me.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.668
I should have known better
than to encourage

10:36.670 --> 10:37.702
all this "robit"
nonsense.

10:37.704 --> 10:40.405
Oh, like your
hobby's so great?
The weather. Feh.

10:40.407 --> 10:43.274
Don't "feh" the weather.
It can make or break us.

10:43.276 --> 10:47.479
Just ask those
poor bastards
down Tornado Alley.

10:47.481 --> 10:47.879
Please.

10:47.881 --> 10:50.682
My robot can defeat
any tornado
you throw at me.

10:50.684 --> 10:52.651
Easy, fellas.
Have some rugelach.

10:52.653 --> 10:54.519
Really?
A category-nine twister

10:54.521 --> 10:56.388
versus this tin can?
Please!

10:56.390 --> 10:59.557
It's got nuts and jam!
Just take a taste.

10:59.559 --> 11:00.125
You fool.

11:00.127 --> 11:03.461
My robot is made
out of indestructible
adamantium

11:03.463 --> 11:06.498
and has a drill
that can dig into
the core of the earth

11:06.500 --> 11:09.134
and change your
precious weather
patterns.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.036
I should have
never agreed
to the drill!

11:11.038 --> 11:12.804
I was on the fence
about it,

11:12.806 --> 11:15.040
and now you're using it
against me!

11:15.042 --> 11:16.141
My own son!

11:16.143 --> 11:16.708
Just take a taste.

11:16.710 --> 11:19.844
Al. Enough of
your deli cookie, please.

11:19.846 --> 11:20.545
Just take a taste!

11:20.547 --> 11:22.147
Look, you're not
a little kid anymore.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.082
You got to stop
with these toys

11:24.084 --> 11:26.384
and the fantasies
and the "robits."

11:26.386 --> 11:26.851
It's robot.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.454
Why won't you say it
the right way?

11:29.456 --> 11:30.722
Say "robot"!

11:30.724 --> 11:32.157
I am! "Robit"!

11:32.159 --> 11:32.924
Ro-bot.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.159
"Robit"!
Robot!

11:34.161 --> 11:36.227
"Robit"!
Ro-bot!

11:36.229 --> 11:38.029
It doesn't matter
what you call it.

11:38.031 --> 11:41.066
You need to find a hobby
for a kid your age,

11:41.068 --> 11:42.167
a hobby that's real.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.101
None of this crap
is real!

11:43.103 --> 11:45.370
You think
I don't know
what's not real?

11:45.372 --> 11:46.571
Well, you sure as hell
act like it is!

11:46.573 --> 11:49.507
It's called fun,
to pretend,
to imagine,

11:49.509 --> 11:52.477
to think of things
that may be
possible one day.

11:52.479 --> 11:53.011
It's what I do.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.979
Hell, I'll go build
this robot right now

11:54.981 --> 11:56.915
just to show you
anything's possible.

11:56.917 --> 12:00.518
You're gonna go invent
a time-traveling "robit"

12:00.520 --> 12:02.353
in your room
just to spite me?

12:02.355 --> 12:04.656
Yes, and he will
walk and talk

12:04.658 --> 12:07.492
and be the father
that you could
only hope to be.

12:07.494 --> 12:08.560
At this point,
I'm very open

12:08.562 --> 12:10.161
to a metal man
coming down here

12:10.163 --> 12:12.030
and taking some of this
off my plate!

12:12.032 --> 12:13.398
Good!
'Cause it's done!

12:13.400 --> 12:16.968
No, no, no.
Again, I'm really
into it.

12:19.439 --> 12:20.505
Rugelach is
a friendship snack.

12:20.507 --> 12:23.408
ADULT ADAM: <i> As I</i>
<i> convinced myself</i>
<i> to build a robot,</i>

12:23.410 --> 12:26.010
<i> Erica convinced Barry</i>
<i> to come clean to my mom.</i>

12:26.012 --> 12:29.748
Hi, ma. You can
unload those groceries
by yourself later.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.217
Right now,
we need to talk.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.051
What's wrong, squishy?

12:33.053 --> 12:36.287
First, I'll kick things off
with a gravity-defying dunk

12:36.289 --> 12:38.556
dedicated to my
very understanding

12:38.558 --> 12:39.824
and forgiving mother.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.493
I named it
"I love you, mama."

12:41.495 --> 12:43.962
You're very sweet
to cheer me up, honey.

12:43.964 --> 12:44.596
And remember that.

12:44.598 --> 12:46.431
'Cause after my dunk,
I'm gonna tell
you all about

12:46.433 --> 12:49.968
how I taped over
my birthday,
then framed you,

12:49.970 --> 12:52.370
and then taped over
even more
precious stuff.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.472
Watch me jam it home!

12:56.877 --> 12:59.978
(ALL CHEERING)

13:00.046 --> 13:01.279
That's right, JTP!

13:01.281 --> 13:04.516
Get my mom riled up
with your infectious energy!

13:04.518 --> 13:07.018
He soars like
an angel!

13:07.020 --> 13:07.552
You did it?

13:07.554 --> 13:10.855
And then made me
turn against Phil Donahue?

13:10.857 --> 13:12.857
So you lost
a few irreplaceable
memories,

13:12.859 --> 13:15.326
but think about
what you gained!

13:15.328 --> 13:16.961
An explosive
jampilation

13:16.963 --> 13:18.696
of my sweetest
rim encounters!

13:18.698 --> 13:20.165
You think
I'd rather have a video

13:20.167 --> 13:24.369
of you jam-dunking
on some low rim? Seriously?

13:24.371 --> 13:26.771
Low?
That's NBA
regulation.

13:26.773 --> 13:27.806
It's not.
I just told you that

13:27.808 --> 13:29.941
to make you
feel good
about yourself.

13:29.943 --> 13:30.909
It's low, bro.
Yeah, thing's tiny.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.077
That's not regulation
at all.

13:33.079 --> 13:33.878
Oh, my God!

13:33.880 --> 13:35.246
I entered
the dunk contest

13:35.248 --> 13:37.048
at the Villanova
game next week!

13:37.050 --> 13:38.316
How could you
lie to me?

13:38.318 --> 13:40.618
Because that's what
a good mama does.

13:40.620 --> 13:41.252
Shes builds you up

13:41.254 --> 13:43.154
and makes you feel like
you can do anything.

13:43.156 --> 13:46.291
I've spent the
past decade
planning to be

13:46.293 --> 13:48.026
a basketball legend
and rap star!

13:48.028 --> 13:50.495
Now I'm just gonna be
some lowly rap mogul?

13:50.497 --> 13:52.964
That can't be the life
you want for me!

13:52.966 --> 13:55.633
What I want
is my old tapes back,

13:55.635 --> 13:58.736
but that's not happening,
either, is it?

13:59.306 --> 14:01.472
My life's a sham.

14:01.775 --> 14:02.740
Goodbye, dreams.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.742
ADULT ADAM:
<i> As my brother's dreams</i>
<i> were dying,</i>

14:04.744 --> 14:07.078
<i> I was realizing</i>
<i> it really was impossible</i>

14:07.080 --> 14:08.580
<i> to give life to a robot.</i>

14:08.582 --> 14:10.782
Hey!
What are the rules?

14:10.784 --> 14:13.151
Don't come in your room,
don't touch your crap,

14:13.153 --> 14:14.285
and don't come in your room
to touch your crap.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.921
And right now,
you're breaking
all of them. Get out.

14:16.923 --> 14:17.655
I'm sorry, okay?

14:17.657 --> 14:20.325
But I really need
the electrical guts
inside this boom box.

14:20.327 --> 14:23.895
For what?
To build a spite robot
that can replace dad,

14:23.897 --> 14:25.897
a nice one
that keeps
his pants on.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.398
Take a seat.

14:29.069 --> 14:32.470
All right,
how do I say this?
Uh...

14:32.472 --> 14:34.472
It's time to give up
your stupid thing.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.441
What?
No, no, no, no.
Never.

14:36.443 --> 14:39.611
Trust me. I'm talking
from experience here.

14:40.113 --> 14:43.481
When I was your age,
this was my hobby.

14:43.483 --> 14:44.983
Strawberry shortcake.
Heard of it?

14:44.985 --> 14:47.652
Yeah, they're those
chubby dolls
that smell like pie.

14:47.654 --> 14:50.822
Put her in your hand
and tell me what you smell.

14:51.157 --> 14:52.757
(SNIFFS)

14:52.759 --> 14:53.992
Nothing.

14:53.994 --> 14:54.659
Exactly.

14:54.661 --> 14:56.794
I smelled her so long
and so hard

14:56.796 --> 14:59.230
that all the berry is gone,
and you know why?

14:59.232 --> 15:03.635
Because I was playing
with these until I was
in the ninth grade.

15:03.637 --> 15:04.235
Oh, God.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.205
No one liked
this girl, Adam.
No one.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.040
Everyone else moved on
to real hobbies

15:09.042 --> 15:12.477
like sports and boys
and wine coolers,

15:12.479 --> 15:14.012
and I was still sniffing
the straw.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.848
But robots are
way cooler than
those dolls.

15:16.850 --> 15:19.918
Are they, Adam?
Are they?

15:20.587 --> 15:23.688
It's time, dude.
Move on.

15:24.925 --> 15:25.924
ADULT ADAM:
<i> The last thing I wanted</i>

15:25.926 --> 15:28.559
<i> was to be that sad,</i>
<i> little geek in the photo.</i>

15:28.561 --> 15:31.029
<i> At that moment,</i>
<i> I realized my dad was right.</i>

15:31.031 --> 15:35.400
<i> It was time</i>
<i> to give up robots forever.</i>

15:39.472 --> 15:40.338
<i> While Barry's heart was broken</i>

15:40.340 --> 15:42.240
<i> 'cause he'd never play</i>
<i> in the NBA,</i>

15:42.242 --> 15:43.007
<i> my mom felt even worse</i>

15:43.009 --> 15:46.411
<i> 'cause she was the one</i>
<i> who broke it.</i>

15:46.813 --> 15:48.246
Goodbye,
round mound
of rebound.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.248
It would have been nice
to be your teammate

15:50.250 --> 15:51.716
until I became
a franchise player

15:51.718 --> 15:54.852
and you got traded
to Utah in disgrace.

15:55.789 --> 15:59.390
ADULT ADAM: <i> In that moment,</i>
<i> my mom knew that</i>
<i> some taped memory</i>

15:59.392 --> 16:00.625
<i> from the past</i>
<i> wasn't as important</i>

16:00.627 --> 16:03.895
<i> as making Barry feel good</i>
<i> about his future.</i>

16:03.897 --> 16:06.531
<i> And so Beverly Goldberg</i>
<i> did what she does best,</i>

16:06.533 --> 16:08.967
<i> build up her children</i>
<i> in an unrealistic way.</i>

16:08.969 --> 16:11.269
BEVERLY: Barry, wait.
Mom, I'm going
to school

16:11.271 --> 16:12.570
'cause I actually
have to learn stuff now

16:12.572 --> 16:15.406
'cause I'm not getting
drafted by the Sixers
next month.

16:15.408 --> 16:16.708
Love bug,
just sit down.

16:16.710 --> 16:18.977
There's something
I want you to see.

16:18.979 --> 16:19.777
(CLICKS)

16:19.779 --> 16:21.379

16:21.381 --> 16:23.448
See, I took
the word "schmoo"

16:23.450 --> 16:26.551
and combined it
with "compilation."

16:26.553 --> 16:27.618
Mom, don't bother.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.487
It's not gonna make
anything better.
