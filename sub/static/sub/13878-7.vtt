00:42.550 --> 00:43.450
Come and get me!

00:43.520 --> 00:44.450
I ain't it.

00:44.520 --> 00:45.090
I'm frozen.

00:45.160 --> 00:46.260
You can't be frozen.

00:46.290 --> 00:47.290
I'm the one who's frozen!

00:47.360 --> 00:49.730
That's why you look on my
passport, it says "Mr. Freeze."

00:49.760 --> 00:51.530
But you tagged me.

00:51.570 --> 00:53.000
Well, boosh!

00:53.030 --> 00:54.200
I just unfreezed you.

00:54.270 --> 00:55.900
That ain't in the bylaws.

00:55.970 --> 00:56.640
Uh-huh!

00:56.670 --> 00:57.540
Unh-unh!

00:57.610 --> 00:58.370
Uh-huh!

00:58.440 --> 00:59.340
Unh-unh!

00:59.370 --> 01:00.070
Fine!

01:00.110 --> 01:02.440
Then we'll consult with the elders.

01:02.510 --> 01:03.980
Shazizzle!

01:05.150 --> 01:06.910
Forgive us, elders.

01:06.950 --> 01:07.910
We beseech you.

01:07.980 --> 01:09.820
Oh, elders, I tag him,

01:09.850 --> 01:11.620
freezing him, but then he said

01:11.650 --> 01:13.190
that he was frozen, so I thawed

01:13.250 --> 01:15.050
him with my eye death rays, and

01:15.090 --> 01:16.590
he claims that I am it.

01:16.620 --> 01:17.220
And I said, "nuh-unh!"

01:17.260 --> 01:17.990
Nuh-unh!

01:18.060 --> 01:18.720
Yuh-huh!

01:18.790 --> 01:19.530
Nuh-unh!

01:19.590 --> 01:20.060
Yuh-huh!

01:20.090 --> 01:22.790
Minions of plebos, you have

01:22.860 --> 01:25.530
angered Zod with your request!

01:25.570 --> 01:26.700
Death comes quickly now!

01:26.770 --> 01:27.970
No, wait, don't!

01:28.000 --> 01:29.440
We'll figure out something!

01:32.710 --> 01:34.810
Frylock.

01:34.880 --> 01:38.710
Come outside!

01:38.780 --> 01:41.250
Come o-o-o-o-o-o-n!

01:43.590 --> 01:45.050
Someone set your mom on fire!

01:45.090 --> 01:45.990
You better hurry!

01:46.020 --> 01:47.220
Wait a minute.

01:47.260 --> 01:48.260
He ain't got no mama.

01:48.290 --> 01:49.260
Way to go, Einstein.

01:49.290 --> 01:50.530
You just blew that one, didn't you.

01:50.590 --> 01:52.030
I don't think he's coming.

01:52.060 --> 01:53.260
We should just slip him a note.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.130
What is this,
prohibition suddenly?

01:55.170 --> 01:56.070
We're gonna text him.

01:56.130 --> 01:57.130
With what, man?

01:57.170 --> 01:58.030
I ain't got no phone.

01:58.070 --> 01:59.140
Well, don't look at me

01:59.170 --> 01:59.870
like I got one.

01:59.910 --> 02:01.310
It was your idea, man.

02:01.340 --> 02:03.210
Yes, it was my idea,

02:03.240 --> 02:05.040
and your job is to execute my

02:05.080 --> 02:06.780
ideas, and you have failed

02:06.810 --> 02:08.710
miserably once again.

02:08.780 --> 02:09.880
Shoot.

02:09.919 --> 02:11.620
I ... I can fix this.

02:11.690 --> 02:13.850
Who we know who got a phone?

02:13.890 --> 02:16.320
Who has a phone?

02:16.390 --> 02:17.860
Hmm.

02:17.890 --> 02:20.390
Ma, you're 87 years old.

02:20.430 --> 02:22.400
You ain't in no condition to

02:22.430 --> 02:25.670
mow the lawn by yourself.

02:25.700 --> 02:26.930
Oh, you wanted me to do it?

02:26.970 --> 02:28.600
It's a living, breathing thing.

02:28.670 --> 02:30.200
Why you want to kill everything

02:30.240 --> 02:31.670
that's alive, starting with me,

02:31.710 --> 02:33.770
busting my balls like this?!

02:33.840 --> 02:36.480
You still owe me 50 bucks.

02:36.510 --> 02:38.110
No, I know the check come in

02:38.150 --> 02:39.510
Tuesday 'cause I called the

02:39.580 --> 02:41.150
medicare office, all right?

02:41.180 --> 02:42.380
So I'll be down there in five

02:42.420 --> 02:43.450
minutes to p pick it up.

02:43.480 --> 02:45.050
Don't be hiding it.

02:45.090 --> 02:46.080
Ah.

02:46.150 --> 02:47.350
I guess no one.

02:47.420 --> 02:48.620
No one owns a phone.

02:48.660 --> 02:51.060
I know who got a phone.

02:51.090 --> 02:52.490
Steven jobs from apple.

02:52.530 --> 02:53.890
Stop interrupting me.

02:53.960 --> 02:54.960
I was about to say that.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.900
Call him at once!

02:56.970 --> 02:58.430
I ain't got no phone.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.030
You know, you're like

03:00.070 --> 03:02.070
the repository where
my ideas go to die!

03:02.100 --> 03:02.900
I'm sorry.

03:02.970 --> 03:05.710
I now have no other
choice but to sue you.

03:05.770 --> 03:06.970
Get my lawyer on the phone!

03:07.010 --> 03:08.170
Okay, uh, I'll do

03:08.240 --> 03:11.140
it, but...Guess what.

03:11.210 --> 03:11.980
What?

03:12.010 --> 03:13.250
This is a phone.

03:13.310 --> 03:14.780
It's also a camera, it's a web

03:14.820 --> 03:16.220
browser, it's a personal home

03:16.250 --> 03:17.880
entertainment system, it's a

03:17.920 --> 03:19.520
home theater, it's a financial

03:19.590 --> 03:21.490
adviser, it's a future planner.

03:21.520 --> 03:22.620
Yep, wi-tri is pretty much

03:22.690 --> 03:23.890
anything you would ever need.

03:23.930 --> 03:25.860
I'll tell you what I need.

03:25.890 --> 03:27.490
I need you to put that down and

03:27.530 --> 03:28.960
get over here and play some damn

03:29.000 --> 03:29.960
freeze tag with us.

03:30.030 --> 03:30.960
Then I guess wi-tri

03:31.000 --> 03:31.960
ain't everything you ever need.

03:32.000 --> 03:32.970
Peace.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.140
That <i>triangle</i> is

03:36.200 --> 03:38.500
<i>trying</i> my patience!

03:38.540 --> 03:39.410
See what I did?

03:39.440 --> 03:40.670
I have a plan.

03:40.710 --> 03:41.510
You know Carl?

03:41.580 --> 03:44.040
That guy next door?

03:44.080 --> 03:46.010
We can go over there.

03:46.050 --> 03:47.310
Use his toilet.

03:47.350 --> 03:49.050
All right.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.050
Something to do.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.390
Give you that much.

03:52.420 --> 03:53.490
Ha-dow!

03:55.260 --> 03:56.220
I-I didn't do that!

03:56.260 --> 03:58.020
I-I just grazed it with my shoulder!

03:58.060 --> 03:59.490
I think it was like that already!

04:00.330 --> 04:01.290
Damn.

04:01.330 --> 04:02.330
You can do that?

04:02.360 --> 04:03.830
Yeah, I can do it all.

04:03.870 --> 04:05.130
What do you want?

04:06.500 --> 04:08.200
All right.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.240
Say when.

04:12.270 --> 04:14.210
Yeah, boy!

04:15.680 --> 04:16.740
Mm-hmm.

04:16.779 --> 04:19.050
Aw, yeah.

04:19.110 --> 04:21.220
Diz-iz-amn, dizawg!

04:21.279 --> 04:22.580
Now you know why I

04:22.650 --> 04:23.480
don't leave my room.

04:23.550 --> 04:25.820
Wi-tri.

04:25.860 --> 04:27.490
Hey, triangle, what do

04:27.560 --> 04:29.460
you think about pumping up my junk?

04:29.490 --> 04:30.120
I want it huge.

04:30.190 --> 04:32.030
There are limits to what

04:32.100 --> 04:34.930
wi-tri can do ... or
rather, wants to do.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.560
Damn, son!

04:36.630 --> 04:37.930
I want a triangle!

04:38.000 --> 04:39.470
Everybody, I got a triangle!

04:39.540 --> 04:41.640
Why couldn't I get no wi-tri?

04:41.670 --> 04:43.200
'Cause I don't want

04:43.240 --> 04:44.570
you getting tied up in one of

04:44.640 --> 04:47.210
those ridiculous contracts
like I just did.

04:47.280 --> 04:48.480
You're gonna be much happier

04:48.540 --> 04:49.380
with the brick.

04:49.450 --> 04:50.710
The brick is fun,

04:50.750 --> 04:52.110
don't get me wrong, but the

04:52.180 --> 04:54.120
network for the brick is very limited.

04:54.150 --> 04:55.550
How am I supposed to
get my sports scores?

04:55.590 --> 04:56.450
Well, you throw the

04:56.490 --> 04:57.450
brick at a famous athlete and

04:57.490 --> 04:59.990
ask him what time it is.

05:00.020 --> 05:02.090
All right.

05:05.630 --> 05:07.460
Get ... get
your hand off that!

05:07.500 --> 05:09.370
I'm supposed to put my

05:09.430 --> 05:11.270
wi-tri next to another wi-tri to

05:11.340 --> 05:12.740
enhance performance and sync.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.740
Yeah, do exactly what's written there.

05:14.770 --> 05:15.870
Sync, my ass.

05:15.910 --> 05:17.840
I ain't giving you no
private information!

05:17.910 --> 05:18.880
No, no, no.

05:18.910 --> 05:20.080
We're just supposed to light

05:20.110 --> 05:21.280
candles, dim lights, play

05:21.310 --> 05:22.780
Marvin gaye, and leave room for

05:22.850 --> 05:24.950
no more than three minutes.

05:26.000 --> 05:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:44.570 --> 05:46.040
Damn. Three minutes.

05:46.110 --> 05:47.570
Tell me about it.

05:47.640 --> 05:51.680
Um... we could, uh...
Have a conversation.

05:51.750 --> 05:53.010
That's something, right?

05:53.080 --> 05:54.580
Yeah, the time will fly.

05:54.620 --> 05:55.820
All right, damn.

05:55.850 --> 05:59.850
Okay. Uh...
How was the store?

05:59.890 --> 06:02.190
Like ass.

06:02.220 --> 06:03.290
Who got kicked off

06:03.360 --> 06:04.260
"top chef" last night?

06:04.290 --> 06:05.120
What?

06:05.190 --> 06:06.260
Try it again.

06:06.290 --> 06:06.760
No, no, no.

06:06.830 --> 06:07.660
You did it wrong.

06:07.730 --> 06:09.000
Who got kicked off

06:09.030 --> 06:09.730
"top chef" last night?

06:11.270 --> 06:12.530
This brick sucks my ass.

06:12.570 --> 06:14.630
When they putting out the new brick?

06:22.440 --> 06:23.540
Awesome!

06:23.610 --> 06:25.450
Now we got one for home and business!

06:25.480 --> 06:27.010
They must have got

06:27.080 --> 06:28.450
together and got married and had

06:28.520 --> 06:29.820
a baby while we was gone.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.350
Hey, can you stream

06:31.390 --> 06:33.090
live movies over the Internet?

06:33.160 --> 06:33.820
Yeah, sure.

06:33.860 --> 06:34.990
But we're also tri-forming your

06:35.020 --> 06:36.160
planet for our race of shapes.

06:36.190 --> 06:37.090
Shh, don't tell him.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.360
Food will still exist, but it

06:38.390 --> 06:39.730
will be so sharp and pointed,

06:39.760 --> 06:41.630
you couldn't possibly
... don't tell him!

06:41.700 --> 06:43.560
Have you ever tried
drinking broken glass?

06:43.630 --> 06:44.600
Vomiting blood for days.

06:44.630 --> 06:45.530
Stop telling them!

06:45.600 --> 06:46.800
You're ruining the big ending!

06:46.840 --> 06:47.900
Doesn't really matter.

06:47.940 --> 06:49.000
You could stop us, but you

06:49.040 --> 06:50.440
simply don't have the foresight

06:50.510 --> 06:51.110
or the discipline.

06:51.180 --> 06:52.510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:52.540 --> 06:53.640
Triangle, can you get me some

06:53.710 --> 06:55.340
shorties in here up all over my junk?

06:57.350 --> 07:00.250
Wait. Wait! No!

07:01.450 --> 07:03.250
They're shorties, all right ...

07:03.290 --> 07:04.190
short people.

07:04.220 --> 07:05.890
I'd better do something soon, or

07:05.920 --> 07:07.790
the only short thing around here

07:07.830 --> 07:08.720
is gonna be my life.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.430
I'm gonna call the elders.

07:10.460 --> 07:11.430
The [Bleep] You are!

07:11.460 --> 07:12.260
I got this!

07:12.300 --> 07:14.060
Little midgets of the jungle ...

07:14.100 --> 07:16.530
your triangle God is angry!

07:18.440 --> 07:19.700
Hey, that's my wi-tri!

07:19.740 --> 07:21.040
Shut up, shake.

07:21.070 --> 07:22.340
It looks like they're watching

07:22.410 --> 07:24.410
some sort of...
Jason statham movie.

07:24.440 --> 07:25.870
High voltage," by the

07:25.910 --> 07:26.440
looks of it.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.610
I produced that movie!

07:27.640 --> 07:28.410
Shh!

07:28.450 --> 07:29.140
Leave it, shake!

07:29.180 --> 07:30.250
Everybody watching

07:30.280 --> 07:31.210
owes me 8 bucks apiece!

07:32.550 --> 07:33.510
Shazam!

07:37.050 --> 07:38.250
I just saved your ass.

07:38.290 --> 07:39.150
Nuh-unh!

07:39.220 --> 07:39.990
Yuh-huh!

07:40.060 --> 07:40.890
Nuh-unh!

07:40.960 --> 07:41.790
Yuh-huh!

07:41.830 --> 07:43.890
Minions of plebos, who dare

07:43.960 --> 07:45.890
call upon Zod at this hour,

07:45.930 --> 07:47.030
during my sleepy time?!

07:47.060 --> 07:47.860
He did.

07:47.900 --> 07:48.800
Nuh-unh!

07:48.860 --> 07:49.700
Yuh-huh!

07:54.170 --> 07:55.970
Aw, man.

07:56.040 --> 08:00.610
Frylock, get in here!

08:02.140 --> 08:04.380
Now how am I gonna
roll with my homeys?

08:04.410 --> 08:06.680
Frylock, get in here!

08:06.710 --> 08:09.950
Look ... I lost my cankle.

08:10.020 --> 08:11.920
I guess those calf exercises are

08:11.950 --> 08:13.480
really paying off, huh?

08:13.520 --> 08:14.420
It's the wi-tris.

08:14.490 --> 08:15.950
They must be tri-forming the

08:15.990 --> 08:17.660
planet so they can invade and

08:17.690 --> 08:19.320
then become the master shape!

08:19.390 --> 08:20.860
Wi-tri, come forth!

08:20.900 --> 08:22.700
Let me ask you something.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.130
You have season 2 of "entourage"

08:24.160 --> 08:24.500
on demand?

08:24.560 --> 08:25.230
Yeah, sure.

08:25.270 --> 08:26.400
'Cause I could totally

08:26.470 --> 08:28.030
see myself hanging with those guys.

08:28.070 --> 08:29.130
Stop that! Look.

08:29.170 --> 08:30.040
They're mating, man!

08:30.070 --> 08:30.570
They're mating!

08:32.140 --> 08:34.270
Real classy.

08:34.309 --> 08:35.510
Get a room, you filthy animals!

08:35.580 --> 08:37.309
They have a room, shake.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.280
Every room!

08:40.320 --> 08:41.679
We'll destroy them!

08:41.720 --> 08:42.480
Most of them.

08:42.520 --> 08:43.549
Yeah, shoot them

08:43.590 --> 08:44.380
with your eye lasers.

08:44.450 --> 08:46.220
Well, I'm not
killing mine, man!

08:46.250 --> 08:47.320
I'd kind of like one for my car.

08:49.220 --> 08:50.490
Hey.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.190
Just shoot them with your eye lasers.

08:52.230 --> 08:54.090
Did you guys say you

08:54.130 --> 08:55.200
were gonna watch "entourage"?

08:55.260 --> 08:56.130
Um, yeah.

08:56.160 --> 08:58.030
My evil triangle has
the first two seasons.

08:58.070 --> 08:59.830
All right,
I'll destroy him later.

08:59.870 --> 09:01.200
Right now, let's just watch "entour..."

09:01.240 --> 09:02.670
You don't understand.

09:02.740 --> 09:03.270
We need to act now.

09:03.300 --> 09:04.800
Otherwise, what kind of planet

09:04.840 --> 09:06.640
are we gonna leave for our grandkids?

09:06.670 --> 09:08.170
I'll tell you what kind of planet.

09:08.210 --> 09:10.110
A triangle planet.

09:11.780 --> 09:12.480
Damn it!

09:12.550 --> 09:14.750
I guess we need to do
the right thing here.

09:14.820 --> 09:16.120
I know he's right,

09:16.180 --> 09:18.450
too, but [Bleep] Him!

09:18.490 --> 09:20.390
Hey, uh, look at this.

09:20.420 --> 09:21.890
We 10,000 Miles away and we got

09:21.920 --> 09:23.020
triangles way out here.

09:23.090 --> 09:24.360
Shake, are you gonna

09:24.390 --> 09:25.020
help us fish or what?

09:25.060 --> 09:26.260
Otherwise, we ain't gonna eat.

09:27.630 --> 09:29.660
I damn told your ass

09:29.730 --> 09:30.930
not to bring that!

09:31.000 --> 09:33.200
It's just a
mini, for emergencies.

09:33.270 --> 09:34.570
Is that "entourage"?

09:34.630 --> 09:35.530
What's happening in it?

09:35.570 --> 09:36.600
Vince just got in

09:36.640 --> 09:37.470
another three-way...

09:37.500 --> 09:39.440
With drama's old girlfriend!

09:39.470 --> 09:40.600
So, how long before

09:40.640 --> 09:42.270
you all tri-form the
earth, or whatever?

09:42.340 --> 09:43.270
I wouldn't worry about it.

09:43.340 --> 09:44.640
You'll be long dead before we finish.

09:44.680 --> 09:45.640
You don't have kids, do you?

09:45.680 --> 09:46.340
No.

09:46.380 --> 09:47.440
Nothing to worry about then.

09:48.180 --> 09:49.250
Who turned my friggin'

09:49.280 --> 09:50.550
car into a triangle?!

09:50.580 --> 09:51.980
They did.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.420
Triangles everywhere!

09:53.450 --> 09:55.350
A dream has come to life!

09:55.420 --> 09:57.450
My wi-tri fell off the

09:57.490 --> 09:59.260
back of my cousin's truck.

09:59.320 --> 10:00.990
You see what I'm sayin'?

10:01.060 --> 10:01.520
Porno, go.

10:02.330 --> 10:03.360
It won't do nothin'!

10:03.430 --> 10:04.890
That's a ... that's a shoe box

10:04.960 --> 10:05.900
filled with marbles.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.000
Trying to play
"gold dust woman"?

10:08.070 --> 10:09.330
♪ Gold dust woman ♪

10:09.370 --> 10:10.970
Yeah, maybe later.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.800
Right now, I wanted to, uh, turn

10:12.870 --> 10:14.140
somebody into a triangle.

10:14.170 --> 10:15.600
I mean, I don't want to kill

10:15.640 --> 10:16.240
them or nothin'.

10:16.270 --> 10:18.870
Just, uh, shut them up.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.070
Hey, ma.

10:20.110 --> 10:21.580
I brought you a gift.

10:21.610 --> 10:22.810
Hey, yay!

10:22.880 --> 10:25.010
It's a bed warmer.

10:25.050 --> 10:26.150
See, it makes it like a bed like

10:26.180 --> 10:26.850
magic fingers.

10:26.880 --> 10:29.080
They said you didn't
pay for the meal plan.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.420
Aw, come on.

10:30.490 --> 10:31.850
You think I'm trying to starve

10:31.890 --> 10:32.690
you to death?

10:33.690 --> 10:36.960
You know I love you.

10:36.990 --> 10:38.530
Who's the geezer?

10:38.600 --> 10:40.960
This is my new roommate, Zod.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.300
Core him out!

10:42.330 --> 10:43.570
Yeah, right.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.170
Take your pills, big guy.

10:46.240 --> 10:47.140
No.

10:47.210 --> 10:48.670
No! No!
