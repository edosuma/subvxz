10:59.359 --> 11:01.192
Madoa?

11:01.228 --> 11:03.228
Kion, I need your help.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.429
A hyena?

11:04.464 --> 11:06.231
Panic and run.
Panic and...
KION: No.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.033
Do not panic and run.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.135
Madoa is our friend.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.403
Just stay calm,

11:11.438 --> 11:12.971
stay here,

11:13.006 --> 11:14.305
and keep the flies away.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.041
Oh.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.142
Well...

11:17.177 --> 11:18.410
Very well.

11:18.445 --> 11:21.046
But it's not the zebra way.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.113
What is it, Madoa?

11:22.149 --> 11:24.215
Janja has Jasiri trapped
in a steam vent.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.351
And Wema and Tunu
are in there with her.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.419
The two little cubs?

11:27.454 --> 11:28.453
Are they okay?

11:28.488 --> 11:30.355
I think so,
but they're stuck

11:30.390 --> 11:32.323
and surrounded by
Janja and his clan.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.059
We'll save them, Madoa.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.460
Just lead the way.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.195

11:43.070 --> 11:45.136

flies in our faces?

11:45.172 --> 11:48.273
Oh, hello, Lion Guard.

11:48.308 --> 11:51.009
I was wondering
where you went.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.280
I know what
you're thinking, Kion.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.382
Oh, no.
You can't be serious.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.250
You guys have a better idea?

12:02.255 --> 12:04.956
We need your help.

12:04.991 --> 12:07.025
The only way we can
get where we're going

12:07.060 --> 12:08.493
is if you come with us.

12:08.528 --> 12:12.197
Because zebras have
the best sense of direction
in the Pride Lands?

12:12.232 --> 12:13.364
(LAUGHS)

12:16.036 --> 12:18.136
Sorry.
Well...

12:18.171 --> 12:22.107
Without you, we won't be able
to tell which way we're going.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.442
And that's bad, right?

12:24.478 --> 12:26.211
Right.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.046
But I think you should know

12:28.081 --> 12:30.281
we're going after
some bad hyenas.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.016
Oh, I see.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.185
Gracious.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.386
Hey, this could be a chance

12:35.422 --> 12:37.388
to earn another stripe
on your backside.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.090
You're right.

12:39.126 --> 12:41.426
There's plenty of room
back there for another one.

12:41.461 --> 12:44.195
(CHUCKLES) I'll do it.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.331
Lion Guard, follow me.

12:46.366 --> 12:50.068
Actually, we're all
following Madoa.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.170
Oh. Well, in that case,

12:52.205 --> 12:55.039
Lion Guard,
follow that hyena.

13:01.014 --> 13:04.015
And here's another
interesting fact
about zebras...

13:04.050 --> 13:05.984
What? That they can't
stop talking?

13:06.019 --> 13:07.385
Well, that's true, too.

13:07.420 --> 13:10.155
But that's not the fact
I was going to mention.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.023
Hang on, everybody.

13:12.058 --> 13:13.224
You notice something?

13:13.260 --> 13:14.292
No flies.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.361
Well, sure,
because we're with a zebra.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.363
Yeah, but look around.

13:18.398 --> 13:21.132
I mean,
there's no flies anywhere.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.167
They're all gone.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.268
Of course.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.969
We're in the Outlands.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.237
Tsetse flies like the brush.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.173
It's too barren
for them out here.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.441
So, if there are no flies,

13:30.477 --> 13:32.143
can we lose the zebra?

13:32.179 --> 13:34.279
Yeah, we'll be
faster on our own.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.282
Thanks for your help.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.350
And I hope you don't mind,

13:39.386 --> 13:41.119
but we'll take it from here.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.220
You can head home.

13:42.255 --> 13:46.090
You mean I'll miss
catching the bad hyenas?

13:46.126 --> 13:48.026
Well... Yeah.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.194
Huzzah!

13:49.229 --> 13:52.297
I didn't need that new stripe
on my backside anyway.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.398
It'll be easy for you
to get home.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.400
See Pride Rock?

13:55.435 --> 13:56.467
Just go that way.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.369

14:03.109 --> 14:04.976
Ta-ta.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.311
You should go too, Madoa.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.246
Make sure the rest
of your clan stays safe,

14:08.281 --> 14:11.216
while we get
Jasiri and the cubs.
I will. Thank you.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.284
Just keep going that way
and you'll find the vent.

14:15.255 --> 14:16.421
Got it in sight.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.425
But it's surrounded
by a lot of hyenas.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.227
Pfft! So?

14:22.262 --> 14:25.029
They're no match
for the Lion Guard.

Well, I should take these
cubs back to the clan.

20:37.303 --> 20:39.170
See you next time, Lion Guard.

20:39.205 --> 20:40.471
CUBS: Bye, Lion Guard.
Thank you.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.073
ALL: Goodbye.

20:42.442 --> 20:44.242
Okay, everybody,

20:44.277 --> 20:45.309
let's go home.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.380
(SIGHS)

20:49.415 --> 20:51.015
This way.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.156
I wanna thank you.

20:59.192 --> 21:00.424
You really helped
us out today.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.360
I did?
Sure.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.428
You helped us make it
to the Outlands.

21:04.464 --> 21:07.965
You handled those
two hyenas all by yourself.

21:08.001 --> 21:10.334
And you didn't panic and run.

21:10.370 --> 21:13.170
Hmm, I guess you're right.

21:13.206 --> 21:16.107
I am the bravest zebra
of them all.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.243
That's not exactly
what I said.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.112
Right.

21:21.147 --> 21:22.413
But it's that
kind of teamwork

21:22.448 --> 21:24.382
that the Lion Guard
is all about.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.117
(GASPS) You mean...

21:26.152 --> 21:29.153
I'm a member
of the Lion Guard now?

21:29.188 --> 21:31.188
That wasn't quite
what I meant.

21:31.224 --> 21:33.190
I'm a member
of the Lion Guard.

21:33.226 --> 21:36.127
Wait till I tell my herd.

21:36.162 --> 21:41.465
Everyone, I'm a member
of the Lion Guard!

21:41.501 --> 21:43.234
Think we should
tell him the truth?

21:43.269 --> 21:45.102
Nah, leave it.

21:45.138 --> 21:47.338
It's not like we're going
to be hanging out with
the zebras anymore.

21:47.373 --> 21:49.006
(BUZZING)

21:51.277 --> 21:52.376
Zebras.
KION: Wait.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.178
ONO: Come back.
FULI: Can we hang out?

21:55.281 --> 21:57.248
Huh, I guess they
really miss the zebras.
