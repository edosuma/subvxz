WEBVTT

00:01.697 --> 00:03.003
[man] You all right?

00:03.046 --> 00:03.873
[school bell rings]

00:03.916 --> 00:05.309
You bagged it.

00:05.353 --> 00:07.224
Bagged it means
you made a choice.

00:07.268 --> 00:08.269
Hey, I'’ll see you, bro.

00:08.312 --> 00:10.097
Jessie Edward, are you ready?

00:10.140 --> 00:11.533
-[grunts]
-Hey!

00:11.576 --> 00:13.752
Why you gotta see the counselor?

00:13.796 --> 00:16.103
She'’s worried I'm not
getting everything I need.

00:16.146 --> 00:19.019
-I'’m not supposed
to be seeing you.
-And yet?

00:19.062 --> 00:23.458
[man 1] People need to see your
eyes, Dai. Keep your head up.

00:23.501 --> 00:24.763
What the fuck you doing, nigga?

00:24.807 --> 00:26.330
Playtime'’s up.

00:26.374 --> 00:27.940
-Your mom lets you
hang out with dealers?
-No.

00:27.984 --> 00:29.681
[man 1] Let'’s make this paper.

00:30.595 --> 00:31.944
[man 2] Don'’t look!

00:31.988 --> 00:33.424
[gunshot]

00:33.468 --> 00:35.339
I'’m not nothing.

00:35.383 --> 00:37.602
[man 1] You talk
to your friends
about this side of you?

00:37.646 --> 00:38.690
About your home life?

00:38.734 --> 00:39.778
I'’m an addict.

00:39.822 --> 00:40.910
I wasn'’t here then.

00:40.953 --> 00:41.911
I'’m here now.

00:41.954 --> 00:43.695
I'’m here now.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.958
[man 1] How you take care
of your brother?

00:46.002 --> 00:48.135
-[grunts]
-[David]
J.G. doesn'’t think first.

00:48.178 --> 00:50.441
[man 1] That would be hard,
having to split yourself
like that.

00:50.485 --> 00:53.357
-[both] Don'’t say it.
-You in my head but you dead!

00:53.401 --> 00:56.230
-Don'’t be salty, Dai.
You can still get it.
-Ms. Shella!

00:56.273 --> 00:58.058
[man 3] What'’d I tell you
about the Ville, huh?

00:58.101 --> 01:00.364
-It'’s crazy around here.
-I live here.

01:00.408 --> 01:02.192
[man 1] What about Seren?

01:02.236 --> 01:03.933
[woman] He gone.

01:03.976 --> 01:05.848
You can'’t save everyone, Dai.

01:05.891 --> 01:07.371
You try to go to Hurston,
young Dai?

01:07.415 --> 01:10.896
[David] I just came to ask you
for your recommendation.

01:10.940 --> 01:14.291
I'’d like to speak with
admissions about David Young.

01:14.335 --> 01:15.858
Am I better? Am I?

01:15.901 --> 01:17.947
[man 1] You the man.

01:23.822 --> 01:25.781
[young David]
You try to track it down...

01:28.392 --> 01:30.046
that moment.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.794
That moment
that it all changed.

01:42.058 --> 01:44.756
The moment that
you forgot to wake up.

01:45.757 --> 01:47.194
[gasps]

01:52.199 --> 01:53.852
[sighs]

02:02.470 --> 02:04.036
[sighs]

02:06.822 --> 02:09.085
I wish this shit would stop.

02:10.695 --> 02:11.653
[sighs]

02:11.696 --> 02:13.959
[upbeat music playing]

02:31.325 --> 02:36.330
Mr. D! Regular like a clock.
Time to put in the work.

02:36.373 --> 02:38.027
Yeah.

02:40.203 --> 02:43.380
[panting]

02:45.252 --> 02:48.255
[woman moaning]

02:48.298 --> 02:50.474
[water shuts off]

02:50.518 --> 02:52.694
-[water turns on]
-[woman moaning]

02:52.737 --> 02:55.087
[water shuts off]

02:55.131 --> 02:57.220
-[woman] Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-[man] You like that?

02:57.264 --> 03:01.703
-[man] Yeah? You like that?
-[woman moaning]

03:01.746 --> 03:04.358
Oh! Oh!

03:06.795 --> 03:08.623
[water shuts off]

03:08.666 --> 03:10.059
Creep.

03:35.476 --> 03:38.870
Luck and opportunity.

03:38.914 --> 03:40.872
[phone chimes]

03:45.486 --> 03:47.052
[intercom beeps]

03:47.096 --> 03:50.230
[woman] Next stop,
Government Center.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.802
[indistinct radio transmission]

03:57.846 --> 03:59.064
Whoa!

04:00.501 --> 04:03.155
You gotta watch
where you'’re going, sir.

04:03.199 --> 04:05.245
[woman] You'’ve arrived.
Government Center.

04:05.288 --> 04:07.725
[man] Watch the doors.
Watch the doors.

04:07.769 --> 04:09.553
Excuse me.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.251
[intercom beeps]

04:11.294 --> 04:15.864
[woman] Next stop, Downtown,
Business District.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.435
Hey.

04:21.478 --> 04:24.220
I said you need
to pay attention.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.353
Watch where you'’re going.

04:26.396 --> 04:28.529
You in a hurry?

04:28.572 --> 04:31.401
You can'’t stop for a second
to say sorry?

04:31.445 --> 04:32.489
For what?

04:32.533 --> 04:33.969
Oh, so you can see me.

04:34.012 --> 04:35.318
I thought you might'’ve
been blind or something.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.015
Man, you are an officer
of the law.

04:37.059 --> 04:38.452
-You bumped into me.
-I didn'’t bump--

04:38.495 --> 04:41.977
We bumped into each other.
I'’ll go first.

04:43.674 --> 04:46.547
"I'’m sorry, sir."

04:46.590 --> 04:48.984
Look at you.
Can'’t even say "Good morning."

04:51.160 --> 04:52.727
-Good morning.
-Hey.

04:52.770 --> 04:54.598
Hey, man!
I gotta get ready for work!

04:54.642 --> 04:57.253
Fuck! Can I do that?
Can I please get ready for work?

04:57.297 --> 04:58.559
-Calm your ass down.
-[siren chirps]

04:58.602 --> 05:00.256
Everything all right, Officer?

05:03.172 --> 05:05.000
Yeah, it'’s cool.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.872
This my brother.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.311
You play too fucking much, J!

05:11.354 --> 05:13.095
[laughs]

05:13.138 --> 05:15.576
I'’ma tell Mama,
you out here cussing.

05:15.619 --> 05:17.447
[laughs]

05:20.494 --> 05:22.017
Call Ma.

05:22.060 --> 05:25.020
-[Gloria] Hello?
-Ma, David out here cussing.

05:25.063 --> 05:27.022
-[Gloria] Leave David alone.
-Yeah, loud as hell, too.

05:27.065 --> 05:28.502
[Gloria] I ain'’t got time...

05:32.680 --> 05:34.856
[upbeat music playing]

05:54.005 --> 05:55.311
Thanks, man.

06:03.885 --> 06:07.454
Dr. Menus, I got your Times
'’cause I know you hate
the Journal.

06:07.497 --> 06:09.543
All right, Mr. Young.
Thank you.

06:09.586 --> 06:13.416
"Mr. Young"? Why so formal?
We got company?

06:13.460 --> 06:14.374
Oh, yeah.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.376
[Jessie] There you are, DJ.

06:16.419 --> 06:19.509
Man, I was wondering
when you were gonna get here.

06:19.553 --> 06:20.815
Jessie Edwards.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.947
Hey, listen, I know
I'’m talking to you

06:22.991 --> 06:24.427
before you'’ve even
hit your office--

06:24.471 --> 06:27.299
Phil Jackson talked to Kobe
before the court.

06:27.343 --> 06:28.431
What?

06:28.475 --> 06:30.259
I don'’t need you
to hold my hand.

06:30.302 --> 06:31.434
This is important to me, too.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.218
Well, I wanna give you
a heads-up.

06:33.262 --> 06:35.046
The proposal--
Would you slow down?

06:35.090 --> 06:36.918
The meeting you'’re
prepping me for
is this way, right?

06:36.961 --> 06:39.268
Everyone.

06:39.311 --> 06:41.879
David Young,
our best strategist.

06:41.923 --> 06:43.141
And, David,
you know Mr. Padilla.

06:43.185 --> 06:44.708
Good to see you, David.

06:44.752 --> 06:48.059
Joe, please.
My nephew, Elan.

06:48.103 --> 06:49.365
Sup, man.

06:50.801 --> 06:53.325
They came down from
their offices at PA Associates

06:53.369 --> 06:56.459
to hear your pitch for the
Homestead Village redevelopment.

06:57.112 --> 07:01.899
I know it'’s supposed to be
an in-house work session first,
David, but...

07:01.943 --> 07:03.074
Ready?

07:03.118 --> 07:04.424
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

07:06.948 --> 07:09.951
Stay ready,
don'’t have to get ready.

07:12.301 --> 07:14.434
[theme music playing]

07:30.841 --> 07:33.148
Two things made Miami:

07:33.191 --> 07:37.239
Luck and opportunity.

07:37.282 --> 07:39.763
Julia Tuttle,
out-of-work speculator,

07:39.807 --> 07:44.420
hearing of a frost that
destroyed an entire citrus crop
north of Palm Beach in 1894,

07:44.464 --> 07:47.467
sent a barrel of oranges from
her own grove here in Miami,

07:47.510 --> 07:50.295
to Henry Flagler,
railroad titan.

07:50.339 --> 07:52.428
Mrs. Tuttle wanted to show him
and his company

07:52.472 --> 07:55.300
how lucky Miami was to have
missed the frost completely

07:55.344 --> 07:57.128
and enticed him to invest
in a station here.

07:57.172 --> 07:59.304
And it worked.

07:59.348 --> 08:01.350
Flagler extended his railway

08:01.393 --> 08:03.134
from Jacksonville
to this very spot,

08:03.178 --> 08:05.789
making Mrs. Tuttle
the founder of modern Miami.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.661
[chuckles] Denise.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.360
[beeps]

08:11.403 --> 08:12.970
Thank you.

08:13.014 --> 08:15.712
You all don'’t know how many
times she and I practiced that.

08:15.756 --> 08:17.627
[chuckles]

08:19.847 --> 08:21.936
So what'’s the luck here?

08:21.979 --> 08:25.679
Well, PA Associates, your firm,
would like Edward'’s, us,

08:25.722 --> 08:28.551
to pitch your plan
for redevelopment
for a piece of land

08:28.595 --> 08:30.858
east of the Redlands
and Urban Development Line:

08:30.901 --> 08:33.251
Homestead Village,

08:33.295 --> 08:35.645
a relatively quiet
and rundown housing project,

08:35.689 --> 08:37.865
known only to
the county district 14 voters,

08:37.908 --> 08:41.172
who, for years, have urged
Commissioner Corey Roberts
to get rid of.

08:41.216 --> 08:42.783
But almost nothing can.

08:42.826 --> 08:44.175
It survived Hurricane Andrew,

08:44.219 --> 08:45.699
and the last decade
of political storms.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.788
But here'’s how you know
you'’re in luck,

08:47.831 --> 08:50.355
you'’re talking to someone
that spent the first 15 years
of his life

08:50.399 --> 08:52.923
living there, and who knows,
without a shadow of a doubt,

08:52.967 --> 08:57.188
that it was poor then,
now blighted, and is screaming
for redevelopment.

08:57.232 --> 08:59.016
But where'’s the opportunity?

08:59.060 --> 09:02.193
[ringing sound]

09:08.896 --> 09:10.593
Stop the transcript.

09:10.637 --> 09:13.640
Just type: "Mr. Young improvises
a joke, blah blah blah."

09:13.683 --> 09:15.337
David, we always record--

09:15.380 --> 09:17.687
I know, we didn'’t practice this,
but right now I just need you--

09:17.731 --> 09:20.037
Mr. Padilla,
I need you to clear the room.

09:20.081 --> 09:22.692
-Pardon?
-I got something
I need to tell you.

09:22.736 --> 09:25.390
And I guarantee
it'’ll be worth your while.

09:30.395 --> 09:32.136
I'’d like to speak alone.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.096
Thank you.

09:39.187 --> 09:42.233
Go ahead, Elan. Just a moment.

09:53.723 --> 09:55.072
You wanna make money
or a name?

09:55.116 --> 09:56.639
[scoffs] David.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.467
This plan for redevelopment
will eventually pass.

09:58.510 --> 09:59.729
[David] You'’ll muscle
your way through it.

09:59.773 --> 10:02.602
You have the money,
the lawyers,

10:02.645 --> 10:05.474
the means to drag this out
for what, six, seven,
eight years?

10:05.517 --> 10:07.432
Ram it down
the commissioners'’ throats.

10:07.476 --> 10:09.521
They'’ll hate you for it,

10:09.565 --> 10:12.133
but you will get
the redevelopment
of Homestead Village.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.613
But that'’s not what you want.

10:13.656 --> 10:17.094
-What do I want?
-Opportunity.

10:17.138 --> 10:21.098
What if I told you
I can get your plan permitted
and approved in six months?

10:21.142 --> 10:24.058
David, that'’s really fast.

10:24.101 --> 10:25.189
That'’s why I said it out loud.

10:25.233 --> 10:27.191
You have my attention.

10:27.235 --> 10:31.239
First, we do this.

10:34.590 --> 10:37.898
That... that'’s the mall
we secured in Clearwater.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.116
I know.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.118
It was hell trying post-COVID

10:41.162 --> 10:43.730
to get that approved,
even in Tampa.

10:43.773 --> 10:44.905
I bet.

10:49.257 --> 10:50.562
Thank you for your time.

10:51.868 --> 10:54.523
Mr. Padilla! Joe!

10:54.566 --> 10:57.134
You'’re gonna get
so much pushback
from this monstrosity.

10:57.178 --> 10:58.701
No offense.

10:58.745 --> 11:00.311
But every commissioner
is gonna get involved.

11:00.355 --> 11:01.486
And not just Corey Roberts.

11:01.530 --> 11:03.227
Yes, it'’s his district, but all.

11:03.271 --> 11:07.275
Why? Because this, they know,
has no chance in hell
of happening.

11:07.318 --> 11:10.495
They'’re gonna alert the press.
They'’re gonna call the state.

11:10.539 --> 11:13.629
Why would they want people
to see it not proceed?

11:13.673 --> 11:18.939
Because in reality, Jessie,
he doesn'’t want the money.

11:18.982 --> 11:20.462
Do you, Mr. Joe?

11:27.643 --> 11:30.777
Look, I didn'’t think to present
this to you today. I didn'’t.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.779
I didn'’t know
if you were serious

11:32.822 --> 11:34.868
or if you were just someone
Jessie set us up with
to milk for money.

11:34.911 --> 11:38.523
-[stammers]
-But I think we have
something you want.

11:38.567 --> 11:40.221
After the fallout
from the press,

11:40.264 --> 11:42.832
we immediately halt the plan
to build that mall.

11:42.876 --> 11:46.401
We pivot and pitch the plan
for the residential
redevelopment,

11:46.444 --> 11:51.362
the one you wanted anyway,
ready to break ground, humane.

11:51.406 --> 11:53.190
No one sees
that it'’s still condos

11:53.234 --> 11:55.540
that most people who used to
live in the Ville can'’t afford.

11:55.584 --> 12:00.197
They'’re still reeling from
the fact that you took back
that big ass mall

12:00.241 --> 12:01.808
they was all ready
to fight you on.

12:01.851 --> 12:07.814
All they see is Joe Padilla
listened to the people.

12:09.293 --> 12:11.774
And then you have them.

12:11.818 --> 12:14.124
You have the money.

12:14.168 --> 12:16.474
You have their respect.

12:16.518 --> 12:19.826
But to have the voice
of the people? Whoo.

12:19.869 --> 12:22.002
That'’s enough real appeal
and cache to launch

12:22.045 --> 12:25.745

[TV playing]

22:41.447 --> 22:42.926
Have you lost your mind?

22:42.970 --> 22:46.408
Shella, Mx. Elijah told me
to come and talk to you.

22:46.452 --> 22:48.889
-About what?
-[Ms. Cueva] Everything

22:48.932 --> 22:50.543
See, look what you--

22:50.586 --> 22:51.848
Yes, Ms. Cueva.

It'’s okay, Ms. Cueva.

22:53.807 --> 22:55.852
-Oh, who that? JG?
-[JG] Uh-huh.

22:55.896 --> 22:57.767

How'’s Glo?

22:57.811 --> 23:01.075
-She good.
-[Ms. Cueva] Okay.

23:01.118 --> 23:04.470
-All right.
-All right.

23:04.513 --> 23:07.342
Damn, like that?
Just dismissing folks.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.431
I'’m trying to check on you,
making sure you'’re all right.

23:09.475 --> 23:12.173
You better leave
before she try to get you
to join her church.

23:12.216 --> 23:14.393
-Do you go?
-Sometimes.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.873
Hold on. They letting online
strippers up in church now?

23:16.917 --> 23:19.572
Uh-- I do not strip online.

23:19.615 --> 23:23.402
I offer intimate advice
through my tutorials.

23:23.445 --> 23:25.578
-Yeah, I know. I watched it.
-Oh, yeah?

23:25.621 --> 23:27.884
You trying to have
a less painful menstrual cycle?

23:27.928 --> 23:31.497
It'’s for my old girl.
You know she having
hot flashes and shit.

23:31.540 --> 23:33.237
They say the cannabis
supposed to help.

23:33.281 --> 23:35.196
It does.
Oh, let me get her a bottle.

23:35.239 --> 23:38.678
-Okay.
-Oh. I'’ll be back.

23:38.721 --> 23:40.201
Shella, I can'’t come in?

23:40.244 --> 23:44.161
Nope, '’cause I keep
a bottle by the door.

23:44.205 --> 23:47.556
Don'’t you have to go
pick up your daughter
and go home to your partner?

23:47.600 --> 23:50.254
-Damn, all my details?
-Boy, please.

23:50.298 --> 23:52.300
I been knew you was with Trish.

23:52.343 --> 23:55.477

You know, they proud of y'’all.

24:02.484 --> 24:05.661

Oh.

Oh, run that shit.
Oh, hell no.

[door opens]

25:35.534 --> 25:37.318
Okay.

25:37.361 --> 25:38.972
We got some good news.

25:39.015 --> 25:40.843
J.G. is breathing
on his own.

25:40.887 --> 25:45.282
We can'’t see him right now
because he is in intensive care.

25:45.326 --> 25:48.764
They are-- They believe
they will have to operate,

25:48.808 --> 25:51.332
-but that can'’t be determined...
-[ringing sound]

25:51.375 --> 25:53.421
...until they'’ve ran some scans.

25:53.464 --> 25:56.598
-The good news is...
-[ringing sound]

25:56.642 --> 25:58.078
The good news is,

25:58.121 --> 26:00.559
they don'’t think the bullet
hit any vital organs,

26:00.602 --> 26:02.735
but there'’s still some
internal bleeding,

26:02.778 --> 26:05.302
and they have to find out where.

26:05.346 --> 26:08.610
He'’s not awake,
but he'’s still with us.

26:08.654 --> 26:11.700
That'’s all we know, Trenise.

26:11.744 --> 26:13.746

26:55.135 --> 26:56.615
[Gloria] No.

26:57.311 --> 26:58.660
Thank you.

26:59.705 --> 27:01.576
You know what?
You right.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.883
I appreciate that,
but my son is in I.C.U.,

27:03.926 --> 27:06.015
and I'’m here,
so we gon'’ deal with that.

27:06.059 --> 27:07.626
Good night.

27:07.669 --> 27:08.888
[phone beeps]

27:10.585 --> 27:12.282
I'’m sorry you had to hear
all that.

27:12.326 --> 27:15.938
She just-- she just
worried about J.G. too.

27:15.982 --> 27:17.287
She might be right, Ma.

27:17.331 --> 27:18.462
I mean, yeah,
she right to worry,

27:18.506 --> 27:20.029
but, David, don'’t.

27:20.073 --> 27:22.379
Your brother...

27:22.423 --> 27:25.121
you know your brother
is a fighter.

27:25.165 --> 27:26.470
She'’s just worried about you.

27:26.514 --> 27:27.863
I mean, she'’s right to be.

27:27.907 --> 27:30.649
[exhales]
I'’m okay.

27:32.215 --> 27:33.782
I am.

27:33.826 --> 27:35.479
I'’m okay.

27:35.523 --> 27:37.481
I would love for them
to turn that A.C. up in here.

27:37.525 --> 27:39.570
I thought hospitals
supposed to be cold.

27:39.614 --> 27:42.312
But this kind of stress, Ma,
might not be good for you.

27:42.356 --> 27:44.924
I mean... chaos and boredom?

27:44.967 --> 27:46.665
What?

27:46.708 --> 27:49.450
I'’m just sayin', I just
want to make sure you'’re good.

27:49.493 --> 27:51.452
I mean, this whole thing
could be really triggering.

27:52.453 --> 27:53.584
Go home, David.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.238
-Ma, wait.
-Go home!

27:55.282 --> 27:57.763
You really bringin'’ up
me bein'’ an addict now?

27:57.806 --> 28:00.591
Right now? In case I,
what, forgot?

28:00.635 --> 28:04.073
I remember every day
that I wasn'’t there for y'all.

28:04.117 --> 28:05.553
It'’s on my heart.

28:05.596 --> 28:08.382
It'’s on my hands, David.

28:08.425 --> 28:11.907
I am sorry for those times
but, for the record,

28:11.951 --> 28:14.257
I have been clean 15 years.

28:14.301 --> 28:15.694
One-five.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.391
But you wouldn'’t remember that

28:17.434 --> 28:20.089
because every time we celebrate
something, you got work.

28:20.133 --> 28:22.526
Just go home.
Huh.

28:22.570 --> 28:27.096
David, we have
all changed, baby.

28:27.140 --> 28:28.445
We have-- me, your brother.

28:28.489 --> 28:30.186
It'’s you that's the same.

28:30.230 --> 28:33.581
And I-- I know that'’s scary.

28:33.624 --> 28:37.454
You had to do a lot of
growing up quick,

28:37.498 --> 28:38.978
but you got
a chance here to see

28:39.021 --> 28:41.328
that the world has changed
before it'’s too--

28:41.371 --> 28:42.851
Huh. Go on home.

28:42.895 --> 28:45.245
Go home, David.

28:45.288 --> 28:47.247
Go find you some calm.

Happy?

30:16.640 --> 30:19.556
[soft chuckle]
So far.

30:20.688 --> 30:21.645
Nice?

30:21.689 --> 30:22.995
Yes.

30:25.432 --> 30:26.737
Now rough?

30:27.826 --> 30:28.827
Yes, please.

30:37.966 --> 30:39.141
[soft moan]

30:39.185 --> 30:40.273
You like that?

30:40.316 --> 30:43.580
[soft moans]

31:02.643 --> 31:04.340
You know you can come in.

31:04.384 --> 31:05.864
No, thank you.

31:16.483 --> 31:18.877
[soft sigh]
Well, that was new.

31:20.139 --> 31:21.531
The coaching.

31:21.575 --> 31:23.838
Oh. You mean
that was cool?

31:23.882 --> 31:25.840
I liked it.
It'’s just...

31:25.884 --> 31:27.929
trying new things on me now?

31:29.322 --> 31:30.932

31:33.413 --> 31:34.544

31:34.588 --> 31:36.938
My bad. Sorry, I...

31:36.982 --> 31:38.635
I picked up
some new ones, but...

31:38.679 --> 31:40.637
I didn'’t get a chance
to put '’em on.

31:40.681 --> 31:42.074
You met me at the door.

31:43.336 --> 31:45.077
What happened to the old ones?

31:47.166 --> 31:48.776
Sweated them out.

31:50.604 --> 31:52.911
You and whom else?

31:52.954 --> 31:54.608
Me. Just me.

31:55.957 --> 31:57.089
Hm.

32:00.179 --> 32:01.615
Mm-hmm.

32:03.356 --> 32:04.792
[chuckles]
What?

32:04.835 --> 32:06.750
I know you be bringin'’
other girls through here.

32:06.794 --> 32:08.709
There is no other girls.

32:08.752 --> 32:11.233
I mean...
unless you into that.

32:11.277 --> 32:12.669
But I'’m not cheating.

32:12.713 --> 32:14.671
Okay, first of all,
relax your eyebrows.

32:14.715 --> 32:16.238
Who said cheating?

32:16.282 --> 32:17.936
I'’m open. You're open.

32:17.979 --> 32:20.939
We'’re open, until we
decide to be closed.

32:22.114 --> 32:23.071
This a trap?

32:23.115 --> 32:24.246
[soft laughter]

32:24.290 --> 32:26.031
Not unless
you want to get caught.

32:28.685 --> 32:30.122
Just be honest.

32:33.081 --> 32:34.561
Did you tell them?

32:34.604 --> 32:37.129
Your family,
about the redevelopment?

32:37.172 --> 32:39.174
I mean, it won'’t be
for a while, anyway.

32:42.569 --> 32:44.353
And you'’re
in there somewhere.

32:44.397 --> 32:46.965
It'’s sweet
when you come out.

32:52.579 --> 32:54.537
My breath tastes like dick.

33:06.288 --> 33:08.464
Text me when you get home.

33:08.508 --> 33:10.771
Yeah? So you can let
your other girl know that
it'’s safe to come through?

33:10.814 --> 33:13.295
-What?
-Or other guy.

33:13.339 --> 33:14.340
-Wild.
-Ha!

33:38.190 --> 33:39.800
-Yeah, still here.
-Yeah, how is he?

33:39.843 --> 33:41.802
We haven'’t heard
anything new.

33:41.845 --> 33:44.109
-That'’s a good thing, I guess.
-Okay.

33:44.152 --> 33:46.894
I promise, I will call you
as soon as I hear anything.

33:46.937 --> 33:50.202

wanted to call and make sure.

Look, I'’m praying.

33:53.814 --> 33:56.077
I know, baby.
Thank you.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.948
-I love you.
-I love you too.

33:57.992 --> 34:00.212
Okay, let me get back
in case the doctor comes.

34:00.255 --> 34:02.388
Hey, Ma, look,
I'’m sorry about earlier.

34:02.431 --> 34:03.519

Hey.

35:46.318 --> 35:47.493
Thanks for coming.

35:47.536 --> 35:49.495
I have a choice?

35:49.538 --> 35:51.366
What?

35:51.410 --> 35:52.802
At work you'’re accommodating,

35:52.846 --> 35:56.154
but at home...
private, guarded?

36:01.071 --> 36:02.377
[sighs]

36:02.421 --> 36:04.249
What you drink?

36:04.292 --> 36:05.728
I don'’t.

36:05.772 --> 36:09.210
Ah, I'’ve heard that.

36:09.254 --> 36:12.170
That can'’t be why you
called me up here, Mr. Padilla.

36:12.213 --> 36:13.475
Joe.

36:13.519 --> 36:14.998
That can'’t be why
you called my private line

36:15.042 --> 36:16.957
at 3:00 a.m., Mr. Padilla.

36:17.784 --> 36:19.351
That plan today...

36:20.874 --> 36:23.485
bold as brass.

36:23.529 --> 36:24.530
Risky.

36:24.573 --> 36:26.314
It'’ll work.

36:26.358 --> 36:27.489
How?

36:27.533 --> 36:28.925
I'’ll make it work.

36:31.798 --> 36:33.103
I believe that.

36:34.627 --> 36:37.847
Question is... why?

37:00.305 --> 37:02.350
I want to do my job.

That'’s a lie.

You don'’t present a plan
like that,

selling out the place

That'’s right.

37:12.752 --> 37:15.233
That'’s right, it's not.

You could easily have
let me waste my money

fighting city hall

37:21.848 --> 37:25.112

almost un-fucking-tenable
for business.

37:56.839 --> 37:59.189
And they don'’t get it.

37:59.233 --> 38:02.584

the mayors,

38:02.628 --> 38:03.977
they don'’t get it.

38:05.631 --> 38:06.893
In order for business to...

just to stay here,

People have to want

by investing
in longevity.

38:34.660 --> 38:36.096
For me to win mayor...

38:38.098 --> 38:40.448
people need to see progress.

38:40.492 --> 38:43.103
Quick, bold progress.

38:44.887 --> 38:49.370
And your plan
can get them to notice
without buying attention.

-I want to do that for you.
-Why?

know the difference.

39:19.487 --> 39:20.532

How '’bout if you do this?

If it comes to pass
exactly as you predicted...

And why would I do that?

in order for me to appoint you
