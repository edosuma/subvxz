00:53.400 --> 00:54.447
Sire.

00:58.320 --> 01:00.482
How is our Duchess of OrlÃ©ans?

01:01.600 --> 01:03.364
Asleep with her husband.

01:03.760 --> 01:05.090
Not in her chamber?

01:05.239 --> 01:09.165
After her fall, my brother
thought it best to let her sleep there.

01:09.760 --> 01:11.649
The rest will do her good.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.371
May we have peace tonight.

01:25.320 --> 01:26.481
Goodnight, Sire.

01:37.440 --> 01:39.602
This is highly irregular, Sire.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.808
My bed, your last stop before retiring.

01:45.960 --> 01:49.328
That was your promise.
I'm tired of waiting for you.

02:29.800 --> 02:31.040
Help me.

02:32.040 --> 02:33.610
- Please.
- My God.

02:37.920 --> 02:39.206
My King!

02:42.560 --> 02:44.210
Fetch my doctor.

02:46.640 --> 02:47.640
Do it now!

03:20.720 --> 03:22.006
Henriette!

03:23.200 --> 03:24.200
Henriette!

03:26.200 --> 03:29.522
- Sire, sire...
- Don't!

03:29.680 --> 03:32.411
If the air is impure
and puts you at risk

03:32.560 --> 03:35.211
you must leave immediately.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.490
Close the doors.

03:42.520 --> 03:44.409
We must put her in the bed.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.761
- Get the King to safety.
- Sire.

03:58.960 --> 04:00.200
Let me go!

04:01.240 --> 04:02.810
I command you!

04:08.280 --> 04:09.645
Don't leave me.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.689
Tell me when the doctor arrives.

04:36.680 --> 04:41.561
<i>* I'm the King of my own land,</i>

04:46.440 --> 04:49.728
<i>* Facing tempests of dust,</i>

04:49.880 --> 04:54.568
<i>* I'll fight until the end,</i>

04:58.640 --> 05:04.409
* <i>Creatures of my dreams,
rise up and dance with me,</i>

05:12.960 --> 05:20.960
<i>* Now and forever,
* I'm your King</i>

05:49.280 --> 05:51.362
Her life is in your hands.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.724
- So?
- She collapsed.

06:01.880 --> 06:04.360
She said something about a poison.

06:05.360 --> 06:08.409
- How could she know?
- It is what she told me.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.649
She spit blood
and doubled over with side pain.

06:13.800 --> 06:14.449
Which side?

06:14.600 --> 06:15.840
- Right.
- Left.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.764
- Both, then?
- The right.

06:17.920 --> 06:20.605
Not the first time. You were not here.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.650
For poison, she must purge.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.928
If she's ill that may make it worse:

06:26.240 --> 06:29.847
I need emetics and charcoal,
iced water and cloth.

06:33.880 --> 06:36.281
She always complained of the right side.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.250
Where should we take her?

06:41.400 --> 06:43.528
She's is no condition to be moved.

06:43.760 --> 06:45.603
She can't stay here.

06:45.920 --> 06:49.163
- We are not touching her!
- We have no choice. She stays.

06:49.320 --> 06:50.560
So do I.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.210
Wait, wait.

07:11.360 --> 07:14.762
No food or drink will be consumed
until we know it's safe.

07:15.360 --> 07:16.566
Take it back.

07:21.160 --> 07:23.049
You believe she was poisoned?

07:24.120 --> 07:26.487
I believe many things.

07:27.200 --> 07:30.044
I believe this palace
is a symbol of our King,

07:30.960 --> 07:33.486
of his power, of his country,

07:33.640 --> 07:36.849
and our enemies
have stopped at nothing to destroy it.

07:37.320 --> 07:39.846
Since the first stone was laid,

07:40.200 --> 07:42.521
His Majesty knew this day would come.

07:42.880 --> 07:47.363
Do I believe our enemies would dare
poison King Charles of England's sister?

07:47.520 --> 07:49.443
Yes, I do.

07:49.720 --> 07:53.566
I also know their greatest plan
has yet to show itself.

07:54.040 --> 07:56.202
What if she's merely ill?

07:56.720 --> 07:59.530
Then your appetite
will be merely inconvenienced.

08:06.160 --> 08:10.006
- Bontemps, how is she?
- It's still not safe.

08:10.720 --> 08:11.926
- Fabien.
- Sire.

08:12.080 --> 08:15.801
Sequester the palace.
No one enters and no one leaves.

08:40.039 --> 08:41.804
Too bright.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.243
Who compels me to wake?

08:48.360 --> 08:49.771
Where did you go?

08:50.640 --> 08:53.086
I had to kiss my pillow last night.

08:53.240 --> 08:55.288
I hope you're suitably jealous.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.209
- What's the matter?
- Our dear Henriette.

09:03.120 --> 09:06.249
I'm not surprised she fainted.
She hardly eats.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.129
She's gravely ill.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.284
Then I must go to her.

09:13.440 --> 09:16.364
- She's in her chamber?
- She's in mine.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.481
She came to find me.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.762
Yes, I know I would do the same.

09:25.120 --> 09:26.610
If you wish to go, go now.

09:46.120 --> 09:49.841
- Do something woman!
- I have to find the source.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.806
It will hurl.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.080
Bite this.

10:06.920 --> 10:08.001
Restrain her.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.080
Is there any change?

10:33.600 --> 10:34.806
She's worse.

10:42.880 --> 10:44.644
I do not regret sending her.

10:47.120 --> 10:50.090
She brought honor to herself
and glory to our court.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.961
I do not regret it for an instant.

10:54.640 --> 10:57.007
We are all proud of her, Sire.

10:58.160 --> 10:59.650
Yes, we are.

11:04.080 --> 11:08.165
Someone is trying to destroy me,
by destroying her.

11:08.320 --> 11:11.290
They won't succeed.
I was seeking you, Sire.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.687
I saw your guard outside.
I came as soon as I could.

11:15.840 --> 11:19.128
I wish to offer myself to you,
as subject and friend.

11:23.720 --> 11:24.881
Is my son in court?

11:26.120 --> 11:29.966
With the sequester, the Dauphin
was confined with his governess.

11:30.120 --> 11:31.281
Of course.

11:34.080 --> 11:38.529
I want him far away from my chamber.
He is not to hear her pain.

11:39.440 --> 11:43.411
If I may, Sire,
I could school him in riding today.

11:43.560 --> 11:47.246
The fresh air and distance
might do him good.

11:48.560 --> 11:51.131
Keep him occupied in body and mind.

11:52.160 --> 11:53.160
Thank you.

11:54.200 --> 11:55.770
We will ride to the woods,

11:55.920 --> 11:59.322
you have my word.
Although, with the sequester...

11:59.840 --> 12:03.686
Allow them passage in court. At once!

12:36.600 --> 12:40.810
Madame, some privacy for Her Highness.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.688
I need a moment to compose myself.

12:51.760 --> 12:53.364
Of course, Madame.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.488
Her Highness is resting now.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.967
I fear we're not through the worst.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.721
My brother always trusted you.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.280
I am honored.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.007
I don't know what that feels like.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.643
This must be frightening for her

13:40.120 --> 13:41.690
and for those who love her.

13:44.320 --> 13:46.641
We are all in sickness here,

13:49.960 --> 13:51.689
waiting for it to take root.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.604
She cannot be treated
in the King's chamber!

13:58.760 --> 14:00.922
She must be moved immediately.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.809
What if the poison spreads?

14:02.960 --> 14:04.200
So it is poison?

14:05.080 --> 14:06.809
It's not yet certain, Sire.

14:08.680 --> 14:11.650
But the facts remain stark, Sire.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.644
An attempt was made
on her life in England.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.484
It could be so again.

14:17.360 --> 14:21.001
And even if we discover a poison,
how do we find the poisoner?

14:21.160 --> 14:22.969
Eliminate the suspects.

14:23.120 --> 14:26.363
We don't have the same notion
of eliminating suspects.

14:26.520 --> 14:30.081
Either way,
it will have the desired result.

14:30.240 --> 14:33.608
We must also question
the Count and Countess De Gramont,

14:33.760 --> 14:36.491
Colbert De Croissy,
Sir Thomas Armstrong,

14:36.840 --> 14:39.491
Henry Howard,
Thomas Clifford, Harry Bennett,

14:39.640 --> 14:42.325
Anthony Cooper,
John Maitland, George Villiers

14:42.480 --> 14:45.848
the Dukes of York and Monmouth,
all of whom were with her.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.731
You're suggesting
we interrogate them all?

14:48.880 --> 14:50.564
I agree with His Majesty.

14:50.720 --> 14:52.643
Whatever method gets the truth.

14:52.960 --> 14:56.885
I will talk to everyone
who had access to Her Highness.

14:57.160 --> 15:01.245
- King Charles himself, perhaps.
- No one is above suspicion.

15:02.840 --> 15:03.887
You.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.646
You did this.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.166
Brother.

15:09.080 --> 15:12.243
We warned you, we begged you,

15:13.280 --> 15:14.930
yet you heard nothing.

15:15.320 --> 15:18.767
The only voice,
your own desire for glory.

15:18.920 --> 15:22.891
How much pain are you willing to endure
before you get what you want?

15:23.040 --> 15:26.840
- Why are you casting this rage at me?
- You deserve it!

15:27.280 --> 15:29.851
The whole world gave you council,

15:30.000 --> 15:33.846
your closest confidants
told you to look elsewhere.

15:34.520 --> 15:37.091
But the advice you took
came from one source.

15:43.720 --> 15:45.449
Or two, perhaps.

15:54.240 --> 15:55.321
Come.

15:59.400 --> 16:02.131
Marie,
the room is dirtier than when I left.

16:02.280 --> 16:04.760
- Where's my money?
- You'll get your money.

16:04.920 --> 16:07.002
I want my money now!

16:09.080 --> 16:11.606
You haven't done anything to earn it.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.489
It better be spotless.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.606
Court is locked down.
What are you doing?

16:23.680 --> 16:27.765
My apartment has a piss-pot
and I hate urinating in the stairwells.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.684
Never stopped you before.

16:29.840 --> 16:33.811
To live like a gentleman these days,
I must try to act like one.

16:33.960 --> 16:36.167
- Challenging days.
- Gentlemen.

16:39.320 --> 16:43.086
I hear Fabien's security lurkers
are making inquiries.

16:47.520 --> 16:51.923
Henriette's lady was taken in
this morning, Sophie De Clermont.

16:52.080 --> 16:54.481
They won't get much from her.

16:54.640 --> 16:57.166
Her lady is ill,
what more is there to say?

16:57.320 --> 16:59.209
Hopefully very little.

16:59.360 --> 17:02.682
We can't be seen together anymore.
Understood?

17:18.160 --> 17:20.401
The Dauphin must enjoy his lesson.

17:20.560 --> 17:22.243
We won't be long.

17:29.800 --> 17:32.167
You accompanied Her Highness to Dover.

17:33.240 --> 17:34.321
As was my duty.

17:34.480 --> 17:36.608
You had intimate access to her?

17:37.080 --> 17:38.844
As was my duty.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.890
What contact did you have with her?

17:42.040 --> 17:43.485
I served her tea.

17:43.960 --> 17:45.849
- What kind?
- Chicory.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.082
It gave her great comfort,

17:48.240 --> 17:50.004
though I never prepared it.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.207
You know who did?

17:53.200 --> 17:54.611
Do you know who did?

17:56.640 --> 17:58.722
- Yes, I do.
- Then tell me.

17:59.160 --> 18:02.881
- What happened to my mother?
- I'm not here to answer you.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.441
Then neither am I.

18:06.280 --> 18:08.681
I recommend that you reconsider.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.207
I have nothing.
What do I have to lose?

18:12.600 --> 18:14.011
Your life, for one.

18:14.160 --> 18:16.811
I do not have a life.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.806
My mother lied to me about who I was,

18:19.960 --> 18:22.645
so I have no idea who I truly am.

18:23.320 --> 18:26.483
You are the daughter
of a Huguenot conspirator,

18:27.400 --> 18:30.449
funded and supported
by William of Orange.

18:30.600 --> 18:33.570
My mother has paid for her treachery.

18:33.720 --> 18:36.121
I am merely trying to survive.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.642
I thought I had your protection.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.243
Unless you are more like
your mother than you admit.

18:45.120 --> 18:47.805
Make no mistake, Monsieur Marchal,

18:48.240 --> 18:51.642
my mother fooled many people
with her treachery,

18:52.040 --> 18:54.327
but you were the biggest fool of all.

18:56.320 --> 18:57.810
Who prepared her tea?

19:00.040 --> 19:01.166
I did.

19:55.080 --> 19:56.684
She knew what she had to do,

19:57.800 --> 19:59.290
and she did it willingly.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.810
Because you told her to.

20:08.160 --> 20:10.003
Because she was born to it.

20:10.720 --> 20:12.085
Because she loves you.

20:13.960 --> 20:17.931
If we do not have the English,
we cannot attack the Dutch.

20:22.600 --> 20:26.685
You never understood politics,
or survival.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.685
The state is a person.

20:35.760 --> 20:40.004
A person asserts himself
or is subjugated to the will of others.

20:40.160 --> 20:43.164
We stake our claim
or are plowed into the field.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.402
You acted out of pride.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.766
I risked my life for your vanity.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.242
I acted for France. I am France!

20:52.800 --> 20:56.202
Without me, this country
will consume itself in squabbles!

20:57.600 --> 21:01.321
Music, dance, art, fashion,

21:01.480 --> 21:04.006
these things
can change a nation from within

21:04.720 --> 21:08.725
to touch the hearts and minds of people,
to bring them to us.

21:09.160 --> 21:12.642
We can't invade the world,
but we can become its center.

21:12.800 --> 21:15.121
One day, my brother, we will be.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.369
The cost is justified!

21:21.880 --> 21:25.601
If I were to teach you a piece of music
that struck your heart,

21:25.760 --> 21:29.401
and the partition was burned,
you might play it from memory

21:29.800 --> 21:31.529
to a salon of a hundred.

21:32.280 --> 21:34.567
They might take it on and play it

21:34.720 --> 21:36.768
and take it on, and on.

21:38.200 --> 21:41.488
The song we sing here,
brother, it will be played forever!

21:50.880 --> 21:53.884
There is your music.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.122
- She was calling...
- I will come.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.725
For you, Sire.

22:05.680 --> 22:09.480
Protocol demands that he stays.
That's always been his excuse.

22:19.240 --> 22:20.765
So it is confirmed.

22:22.760 --> 22:23.760
Poison.

22:25.920 --> 22:29.129
- Are there English diplomats at court?
- In Paris.

22:29.280 --> 22:32.523
Sir Thomas Armstrong, Sire.
Throckmorton is in England.

22:32.760 --> 22:35.001
Word will reach Paris tonight,

22:35.160 --> 22:39.210
Sir Thomas Armstrong in the morning
and London the next day.

22:39.360 --> 22:43.888
When King Charles hears his sister
has been poisoned in France

22:44.040 --> 22:46.281
he will declare war within hours.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.723
A war they cannot afford to win.

22:49.600 --> 22:54.686
My mind also moves
in a separate area, Sire.

22:58.520 --> 23:00.443
If Philippe loses his wife

23:01.040 --> 23:03.281
a power shift might emerge.

23:06.280 --> 23:07.280
How?

23:07.400 --> 23:09.801
Alive, Henriette
strengthens your position.

23:10.240 --> 23:14.006
She curbs your brother's power
and is our connection to England.

23:14.520 --> 23:17.683
It follows that her death
would weaken you

23:18.480 --> 23:20.130
in every possible way.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.361
My King.

24:32.760 --> 24:35.411
Madame De Clermont
conspired against the King.

24:36.240 --> 24:40.131
She gave me the names
of those who shared her allegiance.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.408
I only knew her in passing.

24:42.800 --> 24:44.768
You knew her hostile intent.

24:44.920 --> 24:46.285
Perhaps it escapes you,

24:46.440 --> 24:49.523
but everyone in this building
has hostile intent.

24:49.680 --> 24:51.125
Only a few act on it.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.321
Why did you return to us at court?

24:57.080 --> 24:59.924
I became aware
of a threat to Her Highness

25:00.080 --> 25:02.845
and I thought it was my duty, as a noble

25:03.000 --> 25:07.244
and as a steadfast and true friend
of the King, to inform him.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.847
I find that hard to believe.

25:12.360 --> 25:14.408
Although, I would imagine

25:14.560 --> 25:16.961
should Her Highness pass away and

25:17.120 --> 25:19.043
you were found wanting,

25:19.200 --> 25:23.205
such as your lack of judgment
about the late Madame De Clermont...

25:24.040 --> 25:26.247
And what judgment would that be?

25:26.400 --> 25:30.530
I believe you were seen
together a few times in the gardens.

25:33.040 --> 25:36.487
Then again, card tables
are so full of idle gossip.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.246
Who would seek to harm Henriette?

25:43.400 --> 25:45.562
Who harms her, harms the King.

25:45.720 --> 25:47.768
Your asking the wrong question.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.649
You're wondering who,

25:49.800 --> 25:53.566
despite his grace and glory,
might plot against the King.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.807
I have an idea, if you're interested.

25:59.360 --> 26:00.360
Go on.

26:00.480 --> 26:02.801
It has been my experience

26:02.960 --> 26:05.884
that it is only those closest to a man

26:06.040 --> 26:08.247
who can inflict the greatest pain.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.445
When we are near,

26:11.160 --> 26:14.528
we must make the enemy
think we are far away.

26:15.320 --> 26:17.209
When we are far away,

26:17.360 --> 26:19.681
we must make him believe we are near.

26:28.760 --> 26:30.728
I saw angels.

26:32.920 --> 26:35.127
When we are the King's enemy

26:35.520 --> 26:38.205
we must make him believe
we are his friend.

26:41.920 --> 26:44.207
What's it like being a King's son?

26:44.960 --> 26:47.930
The same as any other, I expect.

26:49.480 --> 26:51.847
You'll be happy to hear
you're improving.

26:52.360 --> 26:54.169
It's one thing to ride for fun

26:54.320 --> 26:57.085
quite another to train for war.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.921
How would you like to play a game?

27:01.080 --> 27:04.243
- A game of war'?
- Precisely.

27:07.040 --> 27:09.202
Before you speak to me,

27:09.360 --> 27:12.045
I would suggest you speak to the King.

27:13.120 --> 27:16.090
I am His Majesty's eyes and ears,
Monsieur Louvois.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.846
- I speak to whomever I like.
- I know that.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.049
I'm just suggesting
you might save some time.

27:23.440 --> 27:27.001
Did you have any contact
with Henriette in Dover?

27:27.160 --> 27:28.491
No, I did not.

27:28.960 --> 27:31.247
You were not convinced of the plan.

27:31.760 --> 27:33.603
No, I was not.

27:33.760 --> 27:35.967
I made my opinion clear to the King.

27:36.320 --> 27:38.971
Do you ever agree with the King's ideas?

27:40.000 --> 27:42.651
I agree with most of his ideas, sir.

27:42.960 --> 27:44.246
Hmm.

27:44.400 --> 27:48.200
Why are the utterances
that emanate from your mouth

27:48.360 --> 27:50.283
so critical of the King?

27:50.440 --> 27:52.522
Because I ask him to do so.

27:52.680 --> 27:53.761
Sire.

27:55.800 --> 27:58.929
You are diligent, Fabien,
but mistaken in this case.

28:00.120 --> 28:03.329
The King has asked me
to play critic and conspirator.

28:06.120 --> 28:07.531
Luring mice to a trap.

28:09.080 --> 28:12.243
There are those who complain sometimes,

28:13.080 --> 28:16.209
but I recognize those
who act against the King.

28:16.920 --> 28:19.048
This is a task you excel in, Fabien,

28:19.520 --> 28:22.967
but I prefer to draw my water
from two springs.

28:23.480 --> 28:25.767
You are the angels at my shoulder.

28:38.240 --> 28:42.165
Let's find this poison toad and skin it.

28:44.240 --> 28:46.004
Sire, wait.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.769
Do you remember, you asked me

28:49.920 --> 28:52.571
to see the face the Parthenays' killer?

28:55.080 --> 28:57.162
I believe I might deliver him to you.

29:07.600 --> 29:10.843
Did you deal these cards?
You are a cheater!

29:35.360 --> 29:36.771
Clear the room!

29:40.760 --> 29:41.886
Not you, Montcourt.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.961
Seal the doors. No one enters.

29:57.320 --> 30:00.369
My prayers have been
with Her Highness all day.

30:01.480 --> 30:03.084
Do you think God hears?

30:04.680 --> 30:06.842
I don't know, Sire. Of course.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.450
What about the angels?

30:19.520 --> 30:21.568
- The angels?
- Do you see them?

30:22.480 --> 30:23.811
I do not, Sire.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.880
Many say they see angels
before they die.

30:38.960 --> 30:41.691
Charlotte De Parthenay, for example.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.922
Many others killed on my road,

30:49.600 --> 30:50.931
members of my court,

30:52.880 --> 30:55.531
and even an attempt on my own life.

30:57.040 --> 31:00.010
Now Her Highness lies dying.

31:01.240 --> 31:04.323
I am sure I do not know
what you mean, Sire.

31:04.920 --> 31:07.241
That makes you a liar, Montcourt.

31:07.960 --> 31:10.566
No Sire, I'm a friend.

31:10.720 --> 31:12.768
I'm a true friend of the King.

31:13.520 --> 31:15.363
"When we are the King's enemy

31:15.520 --> 31:18.763
we must make him believe
we are his friend."

31:19.200 --> 31:20.200
Right?

31:22.880 --> 31:25.406
- You are a fool.
- And you, a murderer!

31:27.200 --> 31:28.531
I am not your man.

31:28.680 --> 31:29.841
You're a traitor!

31:32.280 --> 31:34.806
I saved Her Highness from certain death.

31:34.960 --> 31:36.928
You used her to find my favour.

31:37.080 --> 31:39.003
You sickened her with poison.

31:39.960 --> 31:40.960
What?

31:41.200 --> 31:42.770
I do not seek to harm.

31:42.960 --> 31:43.960
Lies!

32:30.160 --> 32:31.400
Good idea.

32:31.560 --> 32:34.609
Kill him, then me and blame it on him.

32:35.600 --> 32:39.321
But your first strike would have
to be true. There's the problem:

32:40.320 --> 32:42.527
you have never been a man who is true!

32:42.680 --> 32:45.445
Today you get the chance to kill a King.

33:26.600 --> 33:27.600
Your Majesty.

33:38.040 --> 33:39.485
Guards!

33:53.680 --> 33:56.445
Position one, two, three!

34:06.240 --> 34:07.480
You're dead, sir!

34:09.920 --> 34:11.842
Mercy, my lord, mercy!

34:41.159 --> 34:42.650
Do you remember our fort?

34:44.760 --> 34:47.889
- Which one?
- The first one we ever played in.

34:49.800 --> 34:51.290
A hundred years ago.

34:52.679 --> 34:54.523
Or twenty, I suppose.

34:59.280 --> 35:01.203
We came here for a visit,

35:02.720 --> 35:04.882
you, me, Henriette.

35:06.040 --> 35:08.725
We were out
with our governess and ran off,

35:08.880 --> 35:12.043
you went north,
I went south and she went west.

35:12.200 --> 35:13.565
Before they realized it,

35:13.720 --> 35:16.929
we'd found our way to the millstream

35:17.080 --> 35:19.048
and then down to the promontory.

35:20.600 --> 35:24.571
The wolves might have taken us,
but what did we know?

35:26.160 --> 35:27.321
We were young,

35:29.000 --> 35:30.843
cats with nine lives.

35:31.360 --> 35:33.442
We found an old building,

35:33.600 --> 35:36.410
a sorry shack
made out of stone and moss.

35:37.680 --> 35:39.728
You wanted to make it your castle.

35:41.480 --> 35:43.767
But I said, "Let's make it our fort."

35:44.640 --> 35:46.927
For once, you played along.

35:47.800 --> 35:50.371
We defended our position all morning

35:50.520 --> 35:53.967
and in honor
of your distinguished service,

35:55.320 --> 35:57.402
she was the one who found it,

36:00.000 --> 36:03.368
a yellow Spanish topaz,
buried in the mud.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.721
We awarded it to you for bravery.

36:08.360 --> 36:12.331
In the days when it was only you
who truly had my back,

36:12.480 --> 36:14.403
like only a brother can.

36:19.480 --> 36:21.130
I was so proud of you,

36:23.040 --> 36:24.280
and so was she.

36:26.960 --> 36:29.964
It felt like if the whole world
came running for us

36:30.120 --> 36:34.045
we might fend off all
who would take us ill.

36:36.720 --> 36:39.087
"Hold on to this moment", I told you.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.840
"Never forget."

36:47.560 --> 36:49.289
Not that you'd remember.

37:34.080 --> 37:35.161
Sire.

37:48.440 --> 37:49.885
She will not survive.

37:56.920 --> 37:57.967
How long?

37:58.440 --> 38:02.206
I do not know.
But it is her wish to see you both.

38:04.840 --> 38:08.731
I'm so deeply sorry,
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

38:13.840 --> 38:17.606
She has asked
to be carried to the garden

38:18.600 --> 38:21.570
to be surrounded
by her favourite flowers.

38:22.680 --> 38:23.680
Then do so.

38:24.880 --> 38:27.611
It would torture her to move.

38:34.680 --> 38:36.045
Bring the garden here.

39:06.280 --> 39:08.282
Is there a breeze today?

39:11.560 --> 39:14.211
Is there anything more beautiful

39:14.360 --> 39:16.601
than the scent of blossom?

39:17.320 --> 39:18.481
There is.

39:19.320 --> 39:21.049
I'm looking at her now.

39:21.200 --> 39:23.362
I'm scared.

39:27.560 --> 39:29.164
There's nothing to fear.

39:30.360 --> 39:31.885
How do you know?

39:34.720 --> 39:36.324
What came before birth?

39:39.840 --> 39:40.841
Do not fear.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.649
Can you feel my skin?

39:54.480 --> 39:55.480
So cold.

40:02.520 --> 40:03.601
I'm sorry.

40:05.760 --> 40:07.444
I didn't love you well.

40:10.240 --> 40:12.129
You did the best you could.

40:15.720 --> 40:17.961
How handsome you both are!

40:20.720 --> 40:23.041
Oh God!

40:23.200 --> 40:26.044
It hurts so much to breathe.

40:26.200 --> 40:29.010
- Lift your head.
- Make it go away!

40:29.360 --> 40:30.360
The pillow.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.923
Move the pillow, I'll lift her.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.801
- Get him out!
- Henriette...

40:53.960 --> 40:55.883
- I can't bear it!
- She suffers!

41:07.760 --> 41:10.240
- Her throat is closing.
- Open it up!

41:10.720 --> 41:12.768
- Brother...
- We must do something!

41:17.560 --> 41:19.050
Let me live.

41:23.520 --> 41:24.521
Please.

41:26.600 --> 41:28.170
My sweet.

41:28.480 --> 41:33.361
Let me bathe in the lake, feel the sun,

41:34.360 --> 41:36.681
let me feel the sun upon me.

41:41.680 --> 41:45.048
Oh Lord, receive me!

41:51.280 --> 41:52.280
Do you hear it?

41:53.280 --> 41:54.280
The flowers,

41:56.200 --> 41:57.565
they're singing.

42:26.080 --> 42:27.411
Amen.

44:58.440 --> 45:01.808
We're leaving.
And we're never coming back.

45:42.800 --> 45:44.564
I cannot permit it.

45:48.080 --> 45:49.923
I'm not asking for permission.

45:51.760 --> 45:52.841
I'm leaving.

45:55.120 --> 45:58.806
- You would defy me in this moment?
- I know what this moment is.

46:03.680 --> 46:05.125
You are grieving.

46:06.880 --> 46:08.291
I grieve alone.

46:09.800 --> 46:12.121
- You will remarry
- I just want to live.

46:12.280 --> 46:14.806
- It is your duty.
- I've had my fill.

46:16.560 --> 46:18.608
You set yourself against me.

46:24.440 --> 46:25.566
Gladly.

46:27.440 --> 46:30.683
You sacrifice your future
to see me suffer.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.128
What does a King know of sacrifice?

47:14.880 --> 47:16.848
Lord Rohan?

47:39.200 --> 47:41.009
- You're injured.
- Listen.

47:41.160 --> 47:43.686
There are only two men in this court

47:43.840 --> 47:47.287
who pass freely from the world
to the King's inner circle,

47:47.440 --> 47:49.681
but only one who never counters him.

47:49.840 --> 47:51.683
- His brother'?
- Is a critic

47:51.840 --> 47:55.083
but another has lain hidden before us.

47:55.720 --> 47:56.767
Rohan.

47:56.920 --> 47:59.082
You told us Montcourt was to blame.

47:59.240 --> 48:01.242
He has killed many, but not her.

48:02.280 --> 48:05.443
- How can you be sure?
- The King once told me,

48:05.600 --> 48:07.409
he warned me that his enemies

48:07.560 --> 48:10.803
would seek to destroy
those closest to him.

48:10.960 --> 48:12.769
Montcourt told me the same.

48:12.920 --> 48:15.969
We must get you, the King,
and the queen to safety.

48:16.120 --> 48:19.283
- Oh my!
- What? What is it?

48:21.000 --> 48:23.401
The King's son, the Dauphin.

48:24.400 --> 48:26.721
Rohan took him riding.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.321
No, no no. On whose word?

48:30.480 --> 48:33.529
Call the guard. Call the guard!
