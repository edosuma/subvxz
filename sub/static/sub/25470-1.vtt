00:51.718 --> 00:53.612
Let me tell you something?

00:53.636 --> 00:57.658
New York is the greatest fucking
city in the world. My city.

00:57.682 --> 00:59.705
I was a kid in these streets,

00:59.729 --> 01:03.164
I started in a fucking gutter
and made it to the top.

01:03.188 --> 01:05.758
This life ends one of two ways

01:05.782 --> 01:09.527
dead or in jail. I did both.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.915
I made my bones doing a piece
of work for Don Carlo Gambino.

02:27.939 --> 02:31.585
I don't need to tell you
what happened. You know.

02:31.609 --> 02:33.838
But the Commission is moving.

02:33.862 --> 02:38.634
The families will not allow
this type of crime to go unchecked.

02:38.658 --> 02:40.961
I mean Carlo,
he paid the kidnappers

02:40.985 --> 02:44.265
he complied with every demand.
And how did they respond?

02:44.289 --> 02:46.908
By leaving the kid
in a fucking dumpster.

02:47.710 --> 02:51.591
Now, each of the families
is organizing a team

02:51.615 --> 02:53.899
to head the hunt for the kidnappers.

02:53.923 --> 02:57.115
But as far as I'm concerned,
this is the Gambino matter.

02:57.139 --> 03:00.489
And we will not fucking stand down,
this is our responsibility.

03:00.513 --> 03:05.077
So John, I want you to
head the Gambino team.

03:05.101 --> 03:09.248
We are not only doing this for Carlo,
we're doing this for the whole family.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.525
I understand.

03:10.549 --> 03:14.360
I want you to take
care of this for me.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.789
It would be an honor.

03:17.813 --> 03:19.616
Consider it done.

03:31.711 --> 03:36.776
Oh Jesus Christ.
Look at these fucking bums.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.553
- Missy, hit me again, will ya?
- Whiskey nib, coming right up.

04:02.909 --> 04:07.038
James McBratney?
You're under arrest.

04:11.710 --> 04:15.755
I guess somebody better
call the cops now huh?

04:25.098 --> 04:28.059
Let's go.

04:29.811 --> 04:33.262
Come on, don't fuck up! Hey!

04:33.286 --> 04:35.334
Down, not a word.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.920
After I had a successful
hit on my belt

04:37.944 --> 04:42.425
Carlo Gambino opened up the books
for the first time since 1957.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.451
And like that I became the made man.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.565
Can you believe the way
they bring me in here?

05:15.589 --> 05:18.586
Like I'm Hannibal the fucking
cannibal or something.

05:18.610 --> 05:22.965
I got the trifecta. I got
jaw, neck and throat.

05:22.989 --> 05:27.386
They took my tit and put it on my face.
I do one-armed push-ups.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.423
Cause the took the whole chest muscle out.

05:29.447 --> 05:30.992
Fucking butchers.

05:32.248 --> 05:35.312
My body betray me John,
but not my mind.

05:35.336 --> 05:38.356
And not my heart.
That will never happen.

05:38.380 --> 05:43.760
I'm still here, John. I'm still
motherfucking these guys at every turn.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.533
So,

05:49.339 --> 05:51.118
what's up?

05:51.142 --> 05:55.182
You ordered me a visit. I thought at
least I would make me get a phone call,

05:55.206 --> 05:57.006
but the judge insisted
I get the visit.

05:57.607 --> 06:01.295
John, they didn't do it inside
the kindness of the heart.

06:01.319 --> 06:05.239
So, I'm gonna ask you again. What's up?

06:10.704 --> 06:15.166
I am thinking about taking a plea.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.380
A plea?

06:22.340 --> 06:27.405
And are their expectations
of you and this plea?

06:27.429 --> 06:33.703
- Five and a half to seven years.
- Five and a half or seven, which is it?

06:33.727 --> 06:37.373
Look, I don't want you should stay in
prison one motherfucking more day.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.835
I'd rather have this cancer
that you'd have a cold.

06:40.859 --> 06:43.239
But I'm telling you if I robbed a church,

06:43.263 --> 06:44.800
and I had the stipple sticking

06:44.824 --> 06:46.549
out of my ass, I would deny it.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.758
I know, daddy.

06:47.782 --> 06:53.079
OK, so I'm telling you as a father,
not as a boss, but as a father

06:53.913 --> 06:57.018
if you say you're
innocent, I believe you.

06:57.042 --> 06:59.783
So why would you stand up in
front of these motherfuckers

06:59.807 --> 07:02.064
and say that you guilty.
Why would you do that?

07:02.088 --> 07:04.453
Because if I take this plea, it's over.

07:04.477 --> 07:07.737
They are not gonna keep coming after me,
or more charges.

07:07.761 --> 07:12.700
- I'll get closure.
- Closure?

07:12.724 --> 07:15.765
Let me make sure, I heard that straight?
Closure?

07:15.789 --> 07:18.414
What kind of a
milli-mouthed word is that?

07:18.438 --> 07:21.709
This is a word for

07:21.733 --> 07:25.142
over educated,
under intelligent motherfuckers.

07:26.048 --> 07:28.174
This is not a word
that's in my vocabulary.

07:28.198 --> 07:30.391
My boys are still young kids, dad.

07:30.415 --> 07:34.388
If I take this plea, I'm back with
them before they are teenagers.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.961
If I lose at trial, I'm doing 20 years.

07:36.985 --> 07:38.809
Like they never had a father.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.089
She's a nice woman.

07:40.113 --> 07:43.356
She's a nice woman now,
cause she's dying in cancer.

07:43.380 --> 07:46.072
Two weeks ago, everybody hated her.

07:46.096 --> 07:49.320
Now she is Miss Popularity.
I'm just saying.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.624
- When is Halloween?
- Next week.

07:51.648 --> 07:53.732
Next week, this week, what do I know?

07:53.756 --> 07:56.952
Everyday is Halloween in this place.
What are you going to be?

07:56.976 --> 08:01.791
Officer Mike down the block is gonna lend
me his police dress. I'm going as a cop.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.014
What's the matter with you?

08:03.016 --> 08:04.862
- What me?
- What are doing with my son?

08:04.886 --> 08:08.248
Oh now, it's your son alone.
Cause of you, I'm a lonely.

08:08.272 --> 08:09.328
Let me tell you something.

08:09.352 --> 08:11.340
No kid of mine is going to
be a cop for Halloween,

08:11.364 --> 08:13.582
and that's it.
That's not gonna happen.

08:13.606 --> 08:16.806
He's just a kid, today he wants to
be a cop, tomorrow an astronaut.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.429
If I ever hear that you let
my son or any of my kids,

08:19.453 --> 08:22.770
and you for that matter,
talk to that cop or any cop, I'll kill you.

08:22.794 --> 08:27.525
- Relax. He's just being nice to your son.
- Don't make me repeat myself Victoria.

08:27.549 --> 08:31.397
And you, you don't dress like a cop.
You don't act like a cop.

08:31.421 --> 08:33.304
You don't talk like a
cop, you understand me?

08:36.558 --> 08:39.042
- What's the matter with you?
- Me? What's the matter with you?

08:39.066 --> 08:41.390
Don't star Victoria OK?
I'm not in the mood.

08:41.414 --> 08:43.011
Don't talk to me like that.

08:43.035 --> 08:46.285
You think you're such a tough guy. Do you
know, what you're doing to this family?

08:46.309 --> 08:48.608
You are gonna kill me?
I'd like to see you try.

08:48.632 --> 08:51.476
Don't get smart with me. Now...
look, what you wanna be?

08:51.500 --> 08:54.176
Would you ask him, what he wants
to be instead? What do you wanna be?

08:54.200 --> 08:55.718
A baseball player?

08:55.742 --> 08:57.179
No, no, you don't wanna
be a baseball payer.

08:57.203 --> 09:00.978
Why don't you be Casper the ghost?
You put a sheet over.

09:01.002 --> 09:02.435
"Casper is for five years old."

09:02.459 --> 09:04.333
What was you?
Who was you last year? You were a

09:04.357 --> 09:06.674
princess last year. Right?
And what was you... You was...

09:06.698 --> 09:08.110
Time is out, Gotti.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.342
Ah! Gotta go.

09:10.366 --> 09:13.487
- I love you.
- Love you too!

09:13.511 --> 09:18.200
After being IDed by the barman,
they sent me to Green Haven Penitentiary

09:18.224 --> 09:21.728
where I served 2 years
of the 4 years sentence.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.471
With the guards on my back pocket,

09:46.495 --> 09:50.840
I was able to get medical payroll
to see the family dentist.

10:00.642 --> 10:05.813
Not a cavity inside, Mr. Gotti.
We'll see you next time.

10:17.575 --> 10:23.122
And while I was at it, I was able to clean
up some unfinished McBratney business.

11:30.732 --> 11:33.010
Remember what I used
to tell you as guys

11:33.034 --> 11:34.754
it was me, Angelo and Frankie.

11:34.778 --> 11:38.266
We said we was going out of town,
and we'd have a construction job

11:38.290 --> 11:41.510
we was gonna build this big wall,
that was gonna take 2 years.

11:41.534 --> 11:44.787
Do you remember?

11:45.663 --> 11:50.186
John, I want what's best
for you and your family.

11:50.210 --> 11:54.482
Then the idea, just one day you'll
be in a prison, made me sick.

11:54.506 --> 11:57.990
But I don't know what makes me sicker,
you being in prison

11:58.014 --> 11:59.551
or you bowing to these
pieces of shit.

11:59.575 --> 12:00.279
What bowing?

12:00.303 --> 12:02.149
There is no bowing.
It's a compromise.

12:02.173 --> 12:04.575
They get their pint of flush,
I get my peace of mind.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.370
The peace of mind that one day,

12:06.394 --> 12:09.789
I'll be there for my family when I need it.
That's what this is.

12:09.813 --> 12:12.039
How can you be so naive?
Once they get

12:12.063 --> 12:15.294
you laid, you will never be free again.
Do you understand?

12:15.318 --> 12:17.293
They say you win this time,
but next time, they'll

12:17.317 --> 12:19.382
- make sure that you don't.
- There won't be a next time.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.132
I have always felt in my
heart that the day would come

12:22.156 --> 12:24.470
when my family and I
get separated by prison.

12:24.494 --> 12:29.225
I am just thankful that it isn't for life.
And this plea will ensure that.

12:29.249 --> 12:33.938
I had high hopes for Johnny boy. Me, I
was born with 4 fucking sis to my name.

12:33.962 --> 12:36.732
Now I got a kid, going to the
New York military academy.

12:36.756 --> 12:42.613
Johnny boy. Come on.
Let's go, we ain't got all day.

12:42.637 --> 12:44.615
What's the matter? You
guys look like your

12:44.639 --> 12:46.742
brother's going to electric chair.
Cheer up.

12:46.766 --> 12:50.121
Why don't you go get some ice cream?
Pizzas!

12:50.145 --> 12:53.280
- I don't like ice cream.
- You love fuzz sticks, get that.

12:53.304 --> 12:54.514
I do not like pizza either.

12:54.538 --> 12:56.949
How about the movies,
what's that movie you like

12:56.973 --> 12:59.527
so much?
About spaghetti, meatballs or something.

12:59.551 --> 13:00.297
Go see that.

13:00.321 --> 13:03.534
Come on, we ain't got whole day.

13:03.558 --> 13:06.727
Alright, guys, come here.

13:08.204 --> 13:11.012
Alright, you guys better not get
into any trouble while I'm gone.

13:11.036 --> 13:12.643
Look out for your
brother, alright?

13:12.667 --> 13:15.237
Alright, enough, enough!
Let's go.

13:15.261 --> 13:18.274
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Ma! Ma! I gotta go!

13:18.298 --> 13:19.613
Hey

13:19.637 --> 13:20.820
Please I gotta go.

13:20.844 --> 13:23.654
I made you a Tunasandwich,
for the road.

13:23.678 --> 13:27.307
You know what? You're gonna
see him this weekend.

13:34.731 --> 13:38.162
At my house, more often or
not, was Angelo Ruggiero.

13:38.186 --> 13:40.421
My best friend
since we was kids.

13:40.445 --> 13:41.562
Hey, Ang.

13:41.586 --> 13:44.967
Hey. He up yet? You talk
to him, I have tried.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.183
Hey, uncle Ang.

13:46.207 --> 13:48.959
Hey! Whoa! You know
what's good for you?

13:48.960 --> 13:51.063
You don't let your
dad see the cop car.

13:52.707 --> 13:54.125
Come on, you fucking prick.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.961
Look at this. Come on.

13:57.504 --> 13:58.754
Oh, motherfucker!

13:59.089 --> 14:00.483
You know what fucking time it is?

14:00.507 --> 14:02.109
Did you see that?
Did you see that?

14:02.133 --> 14:04.153
I got 6 tons of Buffalo,
they killing us. 10 to nothing.

14:04.177 --> 14:07.388
I put 6 dimes on the winger,
they killing us.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.515
I put 6 dimes on the
Chicago, they are losing.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.655
And now I put 3 dimes on
Kansas city, they are

14:11.679 --> 14:14.247
winning. But they'll fucking
blow it, motherfucker!

14:14.271 --> 14:16.742
Maybe you should hang yourself,
leave all your troubles behind.

14:16.766 --> 14:19.001
Smart ass. Listen, you wouldn't believe
how much I lost last week.

14:19.025 --> 14:21.420
- I don't wanna believe. Don't wanna know.
- Just once...

14:21.444 --> 14:24.738
I would give my fucking life, just to have
The Redskins win once.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.669
I got a Redskin named Willi boy in the car.

14:27.117 --> 14:30.078
I gotta clean up. Motherfuckers!

14:31.746 --> 14:34.123
- Uncle Angelo, look.
- What do you got there Frankie?

14:35.083 --> 14:37.001
Oh! No you didn't?
You straight A's?

14:37.127 --> 14:39.546
You straight A's? I never
seen anything like this.

14:39.588 --> 14:42.465
Hey Frankie boy, did you show
Uncle Angelo your report card?

14:42.591 --> 14:44.652
Can you believe that? My
son is a goddamn genius.

14:44.676 --> 14:47.655
My Frank is gonna be a rocket scientist.
What do you think about that Ang?

14:47.679 --> 14:49.015
Let's go. I won't be home for dinner.

14:49.039 --> 14:50.700
What are you talking about?
It is Sunday night...

14:50.724 --> 14:52.994
What? I gotta repeat myself? I'm
not coming home for dinner.

14:53.018 --> 14:55.603
- Johnny it's family night?
- I'll make it up to this.

14:56.438 --> 15:00.316
Manhattan's Garment District has
long been the central to the

15:00.317 --> 15:02.047
Mafia portfolio of lucrative rackets,

15:02.235 --> 15:05.404
and a hugely profitable adjunct
to the mob's historic stranglehold

15:05.405 --> 15:07.824
on trucking and laboring unions.

15:07.949 --> 15:11.911
Authorities believe that, this
man, John Gotti, a feared captain

15:11.953 --> 15:14.223
in the Gambino family
is the mobster primarily in control of the

15:14.247 --> 15:18.834
extortion, corruption
and robbery

15:18.835 --> 15:21.754
with in the multi-million dollar New York
fashion industry.

15:21.755 --> 15:24.139
Gotti, is perceived as
the up incomer in the

15:24.163 --> 15:26.694
Mafia, organized crime
family considered...

15:26.718 --> 15:29.678
Johnny boy was tough.
He knew how to handle himself.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.986
I told him to tell
anybody who had a balls

15:32.010 --> 15:34.410
to ask what his father
did for a living,

15:34.434 --> 15:36.564
that I was a 24 hours 7
days a week street guy.

15:36.811 --> 15:38.646
Who the fucking god think he is?

15:38.647 --> 15:41.273
He is Greek. He doesn't
have his head screwed up.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.233
He has got off the boat yesterday.

15:43.234 --> 15:46.320
Who gave him permission to
run pock in Howard Beach?

15:46.321 --> 15:49.156
- I told him.
- What did you tell him?

15:49.157 --> 15:51.575
How the fuck does he have
a phone talking about me?

15:51.576 --> 15:52.869
My name!

15:53.203 --> 15:57.165
He says he's with the Greek Mafia, the
smoke is so full of shit, it ain't funny.

15:57.207 --> 15:58.791
Miss Luzio, hold up, hold up.

15:59.084 --> 16:02.002
Lou... Louie... Go help her.

16:02.003 --> 16:03.147
I'll take care of it.

16:03.171 --> 16:05.882
Take that shit off your face.
He looks like a hippie.

16:06.049 --> 16:08.300
Why don't you grab 50 % of this?

16:08.301 --> 16:10.469
Look, I want this shut
down yesterday.

16:10.470 --> 16:14.140
This guy is a nobody, even if he
was a somebody, I don't give a fuck!

16:14.557 --> 16:16.267
- You understood me?
- Okay.

16:19.104 --> 16:20.164
Mr. Gotti.

16:20.188 --> 16:22.565
- How are you?
- You still working out?

16:23.024 --> 16:25.252
- Not that much any more.
- Come on, what's the matter?

16:25.276 --> 16:28.279
- He was a quite hope.
- They just fucking closed on Tully's.

16:28.780 --> 16:31.050
Tully's an institution? How
long Tully's been around?

16:31.074 --> 16:33.659
I have been walking by
Tully's for 40 years.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.971
- What happened? What the fuck happened?
- I don't know.

16:35.995 --> 16:39.123
The rent's gone up, they got sited for
some code violation or something.

16:39.541 --> 16:42.377
Don't you worry. It will
be back in business.

16:42.711 --> 16:44.671
How's your father?
How is his liver?

16:45.463 --> 16:47.924
He is still here.
He is still here.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.760
You tell him hello
from me, alright?

16:51.052 --> 16:53.596
Mr. Gotti. Thank you.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.516
I don't give a fuck who it is.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.351
He is using my name on the phone.

16:59.352 --> 17:03.689
So you tell this cocksucker, that if
he ever deals another card in Queens,

17:03.690 --> 17:05.983
or ever he whispers my name again,

17:05.983 --> 17:07.818
I, me, John Gotti,

17:07.819 --> 17:10.279
will sever his motherfucking head off.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.118
- Put on the ice.
- Ma, I'm good. Ma!

17:16.161 --> 17:18.329
OK.
I will fix you something to eat.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.584
Get your feet off the couch.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.252
Get up.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.468
You got suspended, huh?

17:33.219 --> 17:34.613
What do you think you're doing?

17:34.637 --> 17:38.047
These local kids jumped a couple of our
guys. We was just handling our business.

17:38.099 --> 17:40.268
You were handling your business?

17:41.019 --> 17:43.312
- I guess.
- You guess?

17:44.689 --> 17:45.939
You show up?

17:45.982 --> 17:47.984
Yeah. I would say so.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.154
Attaboy.

17:52.238 --> 17:55.032
You stood your ground.
You didn't back off.

17:55.033 --> 17:58.076
You never back off.
You always stand up. You fight,

17:58.077 --> 17:59.787
till you can't fight no more,

17:59.788 --> 18:02.289
never take backward step ever.

18:02.290 --> 18:05.418
Dad, I'm thinking maybe I don't wanna
try for West Point anymore.

18:06.628 --> 18:08.963
- Maybe, I could take a year off.
- Take a year off?

18:09.047 --> 18:11.299
Drop by to school, not
go to college,

18:11.341 --> 18:12.926
become a bum on the street...

18:12.927 --> 18:14.069
which one?

18:18.723 --> 18:20.224
What are you thinking?

18:23.269 --> 18:25.187
You wanna hang out with me?

18:25.188 --> 18:26.855
Is that what you're thinking?

18:26.856 --> 18:28.483
Jesus Christ...

18:32.111 --> 18:34.322
Booch, I'm hungry!

18:41.738 --> 18:45.283
They get it, if they are good.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.628
Well, they get what they get paid.
A lot of them are bummers.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.379
That's for sure.

18:54.843 --> 18:56.427
The Lucchese is here.

18:59.180 --> 19:00.931
I don't like that guy.

19:00.932 --> 19:02.308
Which one?

19:02.934 --> 19:05.019
His name is Gas pipe.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.770
Yeah, I heard him.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.063
He is trouble.

19:08.064 --> 19:11.984
He is up in Angelo's face
at the apartment of the 59th street.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.902
He is real sick of him.

19:13.903 --> 19:17.072
Look at him, this is making sure

19:17.073 --> 19:19.199
all families know his name.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.659
Prick.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.829
Relax. He is not our business.

19:23.621 --> 19:25.920
Sweetheart,
could we get another round here please?

19:25.944 --> 19:26.986
You got it.

19:27.010 --> 19:30.502
Let me ask you something.
What do you think the Genovese

19:30.503 --> 19:32.629
think of their boss?

19:32.630 --> 19:34.339
What are you talking about?

19:34.340 --> 19:37.134
I can understand the
whole insanity pleading.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.045
Come on, running around
town in a fucking

19:39.069 --> 19:40.954
pajamas, give me a
fucking break...

19:41.514 --> 19:44.433
Vincent THE CHIN Gigante,
according to the government,

19:44.434 --> 19:47.311
the powerful boss of the
Genovese crime family.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.104
To me, he was a rival.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.356
Chin is a very smart guy.

19:51.357 --> 19:55.153
He runs his family as he sees fit.
I can tell you this,

19:55.570 --> 19:57.158
you'll never see Chin
and his girl in a

19:57.182 --> 19:59.049
place like this. That's
for fucking sure.

19:59.073 --> 20:02.474
Well, talking about bosses who hide.

20:02.498 --> 20:03.994
- Don't start.
- Just telling...

20:03.995 --> 20:05.829
He is never here.

20:05.830 --> 20:09.500
How can you run a family
if you're not on the ground with them?

20:09.876 --> 20:13.129
Johnny. You got to shut the fuck up.
Paul is your boss.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.214
End of fucking story.

20:17.342 --> 20:19.760
Who is that guy with Frankie?

20:19.761 --> 20:21.386
What's his name again?

20:21.387 --> 20:23.096
It's Sammy Bull.

20:23.097 --> 20:24.932
That's Sammy. Why Bull?

20:24.933 --> 20:28.603
- The bulls hit dead man.
- I know about him.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.164
You don't like anybody here tonight.

20:30.188 --> 20:32.050
I just don't like what
I hear about him.

20:32.074 --> 20:33.500
OK? That's all I'm saying.

20:33.524 --> 20:35.817
He is a good earner.
And he's Frankie's guy.

20:35.818 --> 20:37.004
He never done time.

20:37.028 --> 20:40.072
I don't trust anybody, who never done time.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.823
He's our friend now.

20:41.824 --> 20:44.201
Hey listen, you trust
Frankie, don't you?

20:44.202 --> 20:47.387
Frankie would vouch to the fucking oomph
for this kid. We gotta give him a chance.

20:47.388 --> 20:48.072
Here they come.

20:48.096 --> 20:49.332
Hey boys.

20:49.582 --> 20:52.084
How you doing tonight?
Hey, Johnny.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.187
How you doing, Neil?

20:53.211 --> 20:54.461
How are you, Sammy?

20:54.462 --> 20:55.838
Hey, Frank.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.150
Sammy, I would like to meet,

20:58.174 --> 21:00.384
a good friend of ours and
a dear friend of mine,

21:00.468 --> 21:01.761
John Gotti.

21:03.137 --> 21:05.640
How you doing John?
Heard a lot about you from Frankie.

21:06.057 --> 21:07.201
Good to finally meet.

21:07.225 --> 21:08.827
- Well, good, I hope.
- Of course it's good.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.162
I'm gonna talk about my brother.

21:10.186 --> 21:12.396
Let me tell you something.
Time with Lewisburg

21:12.480 --> 21:14.815
will make a man out of you.
OK. Am I right Frankie?

21:15.274 --> 21:17.610
You come out of the Tick N the Tips.

21:18.695 --> 21:20.196
Brother Johnny.

21:20.530 --> 21:23.031
Let's raise a glass
to our new friend.

21:23.032 --> 21:24.825
- Salud.
- Salud.

21:25.243 --> 21:26.702
Neil...

21:26.703 --> 21:28.120
Frankie...

21:33.334 --> 21:35.127
You trust this kid?

21:40.216 --> 21:41.509
Thank you.

21:45.263 --> 21:48.140
We walked together and
we fall together.

21:48.141 --> 21:49.809
This is the life.

21:50.184 --> 21:52.769
I chose my side over
40 years ago.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.266
The hardest thing in
this world for me to do

21:54.290 --> 21:55.845
would be to have to say
goodbye be to my kids.

21:55.869 --> 21:57.385
- I can't do it.
- I don't want you to,

21:57.409 --> 21:59.420
I don't want you have
to lie to your kids.

21:59.444 --> 22:01.755
And you tell them you are out
on some construction job.

22:01.779 --> 22:04.240
You and me, job, we never
had to lie to each other.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.616
But it's the lies that
you tell yourself,

22:06.617 --> 22:08.494
these are the lies you gotta live with.

22:10.705 --> 22:13.874
You are missing your kids?
You think that's bad?

22:14.250 --> 22:15.918
Do I really have to say it?

22:16.711 --> 22:17.962
Do I?

22:23.426 --> 22:24.844
Frankie...

22:26.679 --> 22:27.971
No, leave the light on.

22:27.972 --> 22:31.225
- Frankie, we are just down.
- Oh, leave the light on. Kids

22:31.267 --> 22:32.768
are scared of the dark.

22:32.769 --> 22:35.146
- This till John gets back?
- Till John gets back.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.399
Good night, Frankie. Love you.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.319
- See you tomorrow.
- I love you.

23:56.602 --> 23:59.802
Oh God, no, Frankie, Frankie.

23:59.814 --> 24:02.483
- I did not see him.
- Frankie.

24:04.277 --> 24:05.877
Mommy is here.
Oh, Frankie. Mommy's here.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.533
The sun has blinded.

24:11.033 --> 24:12.785
Mommy's here. Stay wake.

25:45.253 --> 25:48.130
Johnny boy, it was an accident.

25:48.631 --> 25:50.841
It was an accident. It happened.

25:51.259 --> 25:52.551
He is gone.

25:53.010 --> 25:55.262
But he will always
be your brother.

25:55.263 --> 25:56.554
Now, you listen to me.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.848
I want you to be strong, okay?

25:58.849 --> 26:00.558
I'm proud of you.

26:00.559 --> 26:03.186
We gotta do this for your mother.
Go ahead.

26:03.187 --> 26:04.939
Come on.

26:09.986 --> 26:11.320
Come here.

26:11.612 --> 26:12.863
Come here.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.323
Come here.

26:15.783 --> 26:17.076
Come here.

27:25.353 --> 27:27.723
Come on, I'm late.
What the hell are you waiting for?

27:36.030 --> 27:38.656
- What are you doing?
- Frankie is cold.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.577
- He needs a blanket. No!
- Come here.

27:42.203 --> 27:43.662
Come here.

27:44.872 --> 27:47.041
It will be fine. Come here.

27:47.458 --> 27:49.043
It will be fine.

27:51.420 --> 27:54.255
Calm down, Vicky. Calm down.

27:54.256 --> 27:57.301
I need to go. I must.

27:58.094 --> 28:00.387
Listen to me, listen to me.

28:00.388 --> 28:02.222
I need to go.

28:02.223 --> 28:04.599
I have to bring him a blanket.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.310
He is cold!

28:23.202 --> 28:25.787
What happened? Is Vicky OK?

28:25.788 --> 28:27.497
This piece of shit Favara.

28:27.498 --> 28:29.708
She smacked him around with a baseball bat.

28:29.834 --> 28:31.292
She's gonna be alright.

28:31.293 --> 28:33.044
He's a stupid fucking asshole, John!

28:33.045 --> 28:35.088
He never fixed the dent in a car!

28:35.089 --> 28:38.676
He leaves it there even in the driveway,
day after day for Vicky to see.

28:39.218 --> 28:41.720
John, we can't know why

28:41.887 --> 28:43.513
God lets these things happen,

28:43.514 --> 28:46.016
but there has to be a reason.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.559
A reason?

28:47.560 --> 28:49.269
For these things?

28:49.520 --> 28:52.689
He was 12 years old. He didn't
have a hair in his prink.

28:52.690 --> 28:55.567
There ain't no fucking reason.
There ain't no fucking God.

28:55.568 --> 28:57.903
Don't say another word.

29:02.950 --> 29:06.495
I'mma take Vicky down to
Florida to see her family.

29:06.912 --> 29:09.080
I think, it will be good for us.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.666
Clear our heads.

29:24.138 --> 29:25.930
On March 12, 1980,

29:25.931 --> 29:29.017
12 year old Frank Gotti was riding
his mini bike on this street,

29:29.018 --> 29:32.187
157th Avenue,
just 3 blocks from his home,

29:32.354 --> 29:36.232
John Favara's car hit 12 year
old Frank Gotti and killed him.

29:36.233 --> 29:40.403
The people who know the Gotti they never
came to terms with young Frank's death.

29:40.404 --> 29:41.840
Police however believed someone,

29:41.864 --> 29:44.157
did come to terms with John Favara.

29:44.158 --> 29:47.577
On July 28th, Favara left his job and

29:47.578 --> 29:50.348
walked to his car which was parked
next door at the Capitol Diner.

29:50.372 --> 29:52.957
The Diner's owner told Police he saw 3 men

29:52.958 --> 29:55.210
clubbed Favara and
shoved him into a van.

29:55.211 --> 29:58.254
The best witness Police had
in the abduction of John Favara

29:58.255 --> 30:00.757
was Leon Papon, the man who
owned the diner,

30:00.758 --> 30:04.178
he had seen the whole thing,
he told that to Nassau County police.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.555
But then the assailants returned
to the diner, several days later.

30:07.556 --> 30:09.432
They reportedly ordered coffee

30:09.433 --> 30:12.101
and as they Sept it,
they stared at Papon.

30:12.102 --> 30:16.482
Right after that, Papon stopped
cooperating with Nassau County Detectives.

30:16.524 --> 30:18.650
His memory of the incident faded.

30:18.651 --> 30:21.320
He sold the
diner and moved away.

30:28.452 --> 30:30.704
OK, that's it. That's it.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.497
That's it.

30:32.498 --> 30:33.749
That's it.

30:35.125 --> 30:36.418
Vicky...

30:36.919 --> 30:37.979
Enough.

30:38.003 --> 30:40.463
I love you, but we
got four other kids.

30:40.464 --> 30:43.716
We'll never let go of Frankie,
do you understand me? Never.

30:43.717 --> 30:45.761
He is in our hearts forever.

30:46.136 --> 30:48.680
For ever. Till the day we die.

30:48.681 --> 30:51.391
We are gonna always live like
we are seven.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.229
I'm gonna make you some coffee.

31:08.659 --> 31:09.952
Alright.

31:10.077 --> 31:11.912
No problem. Merry Christmas.

31:15.332 --> 31:18.283
Look at him. That
lousy bastard father

31:18.307 --> 31:21.231
turns out to be a good grandpa.

31:21.255 --> 31:23.298
- Who knew?
- You never know...

31:23.465 --> 31:26.342
Tell you something,
maybe if we didn't have such crappy parents

31:26.343 --> 31:28.970
we would have so much in common.
You understand?

31:28.971 --> 31:32.557
Yeah. I would be living in Flat bush
married to a dentist.

31:32.558 --> 31:35.518
What are you talking about?
You get a bad tooth

31:35.519 --> 31:38.188
I will happy to knock that
right out of your mouth.

31:39.607 --> 31:41.984
There is my smile, there is my girl.

31:42.735 --> 31:46.145
You didn't think you'd be used to having
hundred people around this house, huh?

31:46.322 --> 31:49.074
Yeah. One night a
year, I can handle it.

31:49.867 --> 31:51.284
Can you believe it?

31:51.285 --> 31:54.287
We used to barely have
enough for the two of us.

31:54.288 --> 31:56.789
But we had each other.
That's what it matters.

31:56.790 --> 31:58.666
That's all it matters.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.377
You and me, we get through this together.

32:01.378 --> 32:03.213
We get through anything.

32:06.759 --> 32:08.677
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

32:09.887 --> 32:13.307
Let me ask you, who is that
guy sitting in my chair?

32:14.183 --> 32:15.511
You've been meaning to ask?

32:15.535 --> 32:17.996
That guy has been in your chair every
Christmas for the last 15 years.

32:18.020 --> 32:19.521
For 15 years.

32:23.692 --> 32:25.276
Let me get you a drink.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.779
- How about a cigar?
- Let's do it.

32:27.780 --> 32:29.113
Sammy Gravano told me

32:29.114 --> 32:30.133
something.

32:30.157 --> 32:31.741
What did Sammy Gravano say?

32:31.742 --> 32:33.264
You was over at
Paul's house just now.

32:33.288 --> 32:35.576
Yeah, I was at
Paul's house just now.

32:35.871 --> 32:39.666
- Did you see Sammy there?
- No. I just stopped by for 2 minutes.

32:39.667 --> 32:43.837
He tells Paul, he says I wanna go see
Neil, wish him a merry Christmas.

32:44.922 --> 32:47.465
- Why do I give a shit about all this?
- Paul said:

32:47.466 --> 32:49.361
What the hell you wanna do that for?
You are on our side.

32:49.385 --> 32:50.945
And what did Sammy say to that?

32:50.969 --> 32:53.388
He said "We are all a family, ain't we?"

32:56.809 --> 32:58.059
Sammy told you that?

32:58.060 --> 32:59.561
Sammy told me.

33:19.289 --> 33:20.791
You need a woman.

33:39.643 --> 33:42.061
- Now I know.
- I can not believe.

33:42.062 --> 33:43.563
Paul...

33:43.564 --> 33:46.149
Paul Castellano was a
fucking fish in the desert.

33:46.275 --> 33:47.984
A fish out of the water.

33:47.985 --> 33:49.944
I never respected Paul.

33:49.945 --> 33:52.155
Neil was much more of a boss

33:52.156 --> 33:53.698
that Paul ever was.

33:53.699 --> 33:56.826
- Give my regards to Victoria.
- I will, thanks.

33:56.827 --> 33:58.662
She will be glad to hear it.

34:16.929 --> 34:19.620
I'm just saying, if Paul goes
to prison for them indictments

34:19.641 --> 34:21.745
they're gonna make Tommy
Bilorti the street boss.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.730
Happy days! We're gonna have
hold it to wig business.

34:25.022 --> 34:27.356
Neil, what's going on here?

34:27.357 --> 34:29.317
Keeping Paul

34:29.318 --> 34:31.379
He's not concerned making the deal with
those other families than his own.

34:31.402 --> 34:33.404
He's the boss. End
of fucking story.

34:33.405 --> 34:36.072
Time Magazine says,
you, the boss.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.643
Shows you what a disreputable
fucking profession that is.

34:38.952 --> 34:41.536
- You know why.
- I tell you why.

34:41.538 --> 34:44.290
Because we have never been under
this kind of scrutiny before.

34:44.291 --> 34:46.208
They can see you, Neil.

34:46.251 --> 34:48.252
- Yeah. Too fucking much.
- No, no, no!

34:48.253 --> 34:51.922
You could see, he could talk man to
man with you. Know what I'm saying?

34:51.924 --> 34:54.926
What's Paul's contribution to
society, fucking his

34:54.927 --> 34:56.260
Portuguese maid?

34:56.261 --> 34:58.471
As long as it keeps him off my back...

34:58.472 --> 35:02.642
Yeah but, 35 years, in the same house
as his wife. I mean, that ain't right.

35:05.229 --> 35:06.938
I guess you gotta give him credit.

35:07.439 --> 35:09.649
For what? His penile implant?

35:10.067 --> 35:11.651
You got his house bugged? Do you?

35:11.652 --> 35:14.714
Yeah, I defeated that 50 thousand dollar
security system with my good looks.

35:14.738 --> 35:17.156
That Portuguese maid
was crazy about me.

35:17.157 --> 35:20.409
She is Guatemalan.

35:20.410 --> 35:23.431
So, you have seen it? What ever country
she is from they probably made her leave.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.707
I would not fuck her with your dick.

35:27.543 --> 35:29.252
Listen. Paul has got diabetes.

35:31.505 --> 35:33.923
It's not a subject I feel
comfortable discussing.

35:33.924 --> 35:35.876
What the fuck is so fucking funny?

35:35.999 --> 35:38.290
It's hysterical,
we're gonna get a fucking accident.

35:45.686 --> 35:47.770
Oh, look at this place.
What a dump!

35:47.771 --> 35:49.355
What are we doing here?

35:49.356 --> 35:51.918
We get a couple of drinks get the fuck
outta here, go get something to eat.

35:51.942 --> 35:55.695
Let's go to "Little Pete", it's got that
shrimp in there. I mean you like this.

35:55.696 --> 35:56.881
It's a cop zone.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.550
It's fucking Garry and
his fucking shrimp...

35:58.574 --> 35:59.634
How about a little shot, it's on me.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.136
- No, we are good. Thanks.
- What the fuck you guys are talking about?

36:02.160 --> 36:03.744
I went there the other week.

36:03.745 --> 36:05.371
It's not filled with cops.

36:05.372 --> 36:07.982
Do me a favor, take a walk, you
and your fucking mustache.

36:08.125 --> 36:10.001
Five cops, last week, heading...

36:10.002 --> 36:13.130
- Three shots for me and my boys here.
- We're good, thank you.

36:13.630 --> 36:15.720
Hey, you're too good to
have a shot with me?

36:16.592 --> 36:18.468
I said take a fucking walk.

36:39.114 --> 36:40.365
Stay down motherfucker!

36:43.619 --> 36:45.537
- Connard!
- Fucker!

36:46.038 --> 36:47.830
You motherfucking piece of shit!

36:47.831 --> 36:49.291
Little shit!

36:52.419 --> 36:54.379
John, come on! Come on!

36:55.213 --> 36:56.798
Fuck!

37:04.556 --> 37:06.226
I didn't give a fuck,
when he came in, I

37:06.250 --> 37:08.202
grabbed the ball stool,
I grabbed 2 ball stools

37:08.226 --> 37:09.662
I was going over, I don't give a fuck.
I just kept going.

37:09.686 --> 37:12.165
Oh my God, I was swinging I didn't
know who the fuck I was hitting.

37:12.189 --> 37:13.700
You swinged at the wrong guy 3 times.

37:13.724 --> 37:15.001
- No I didn't.
- You kidding me?

37:15.025 --> 37:17.944
You hit the wrong kid. He
wasn't even with them.

37:24.743 --> 37:26.661
You little motherfucker!

37:27.579 --> 37:29.414
Did you have a fight tonight?
Did you?

37:30.290 --> 37:33.167
Someone got killed!
Did you know that? Did you?

37:33.168 --> 37:36.045
- No I did not know that!
- You shut the fuck up.

37:36.046 --> 37:38.756
You cocksuckers! You
gonna ruin your future!

37:38.757 --> 37:40.216
Don't you understand?

37:40.217 --> 37:43.261
It's gonna follow you for the
rest of your fucking... life!

37:48.850 --> 37:51.436
- Someone got killed?
- Not when I was there.

37:53.355 --> 37:56.899
Proudest moment of his life was watching
you graduate from military school.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.860
And now this. You father is crushed.

37:59.069 --> 38:00.695
- You know that?
- I know.

38:01.196 --> 38:03.114
- No! You do not know anything!
- Dad...

38:03.115 --> 38:05.282
Now shut up. I will talk to you later.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.742
The sharks are circling.

38:06.743 --> 38:09.370
The cops are gonna shake him down.
And that man's gonna,

38:09.371 --> 38:11.038
pay to protect you.

38:11.039 --> 38:14.167
I didn't kill the guy!
I will answer for it, anything!

38:14.209 --> 38:16.711
- We didn't kill anybody.
- I know that.

38:16.712 --> 38:18.629
But it doesn't fucking matter.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.840
You two stupid motherfuckers.

38:20.841 --> 38:24.344
You brought a lot of fucking hate down
on this family.

38:25.262 --> 38:28.556
Actually, it was Angelo
who put the heat down on the family

38:28.765 --> 38:31.642
when the government
released what would become known as

38:31.643 --> 38:34.145
the "Angelo Ruggiero tapes".

38:34.146 --> 38:36.355
They picked up Ang on a wire tap.

38:36.356 --> 38:38.232
Taking about various activities that

38:38.233 --> 38:41.652
neither Paul or the
government would've sanctioned.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.195
Fucking Ang.

38:43.196 --> 38:44.947
This is ridiculous!

38:44.948 --> 38:46.323
You got popped Ang.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.284
Let me just ask you one question.

38:48.285 --> 38:50.911
Are you bad mouthing Paul on them tapes?
Are you?

38:50.912 --> 38:53.099
- I don't know, there's hundreds of hours.
- Oh come on!

38:53.123 --> 38:56.083
- What? You don't know nothing?
- They bugged my daughters'.

38:56.084 --> 38:57.603
What were you saying on the tapes?

38:57.627 --> 38:59.767
I said a lot of things
that could get a lot of

38:59.791 --> 39:02.048
people in a lot of
trouble. It's what I said.

39:02.049 --> 39:03.966
My friends are on those tapes.

39:03.967 --> 39:05.403
Our friends are on those tapes.

39:05.427 --> 39:07.595
Neil... OK...

39:07.846 --> 39:11.975
If Angelo decides that he's gonna turn
these tapes over to Paul? What happens?

39:12.184 --> 39:13.517
- Is that it?
- No.

39:13.518 --> 39:16.104
That is most definitely not fucking it.

39:17.189 --> 39:20.107
If Paul wants the tapes,
we gotta get him the tapes.

39:20.108 --> 39:23.528
He's the boss. Boss is the boss is
the boss, that's the Cosa Nostra.

39:23.987 --> 39:26.489
Tell me I don't know
something about it, please!

39:26.490 --> 39:28.991
If it was just some fucking asshole,

39:28.992 --> 39:31.429
getting called out of some Joe,
he know I would authorize the

39:31.453 --> 39:33.621
handover in a second.

39:34.331 --> 39:36.457
- But this is our friends.
- Look...

39:36.458 --> 39:38.751
If the government has a case,

39:38.752 --> 39:41.212
Paul will find out when it comes to trial,

39:41.213 --> 39:44.224
because it will be matter of public record.
You are fucked either way.

39:44.424 --> 39:46.092
We are fucked.

39:46.093 --> 39:48.928
OK. We are fucked either way.

39:58.730 --> 40:01.691
No no, that's not gonna happen. Get
it out of your head right now.

40:07.197 --> 40:08.489
Listen...

40:08.490 --> 40:12.618
You know, Paul doesn't give
2 fucks about me or you,

40:12.619 --> 40:14.537
He shit picks over his fucking case.

40:14.538 --> 40:15.932
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about?

40:15.956 --> 40:18.124
Ang, just shut the fuck up, will you?

40:18.583 --> 40:20.251
You got us into this mess.

40:20.252 --> 40:23.463
- Please.
- Get the fuck out of here, Ang. Go on.

40:34.599 --> 40:36.393
Christ almighty...

40:37.435 --> 40:39.478
I ain't saying you're wrong.

40:39.479 --> 40:41.606
But what do you want me to tell Paul?

40:41.731 --> 40:45.943
Ang is saying to the boss, "Fuck you! I
don't wanna handover those fucking tapes!"

40:45.944 --> 40:48.530
I've been trying to make
this thing go away, but...

40:49.072 --> 40:50.949
Paul keeps bringing it up.

40:51.283 --> 40:54.494
Unless I say it to him, Fuck you!
Go fuck yourself!

40:54.870 --> 40:57.246
And then, you know,
we gotta do then...

40:57.247 --> 40:59.456
We roll a mother, we go to war.

40:59.457 --> 41:03.461
That's right. We gotta do what we gotta do.
We strike him before he gets to us.

41:07.215 --> 41:08.465
What?

41:08.508 --> 41:10.759
- What's the matter, you OK?
- Yeah.. no.

41:10.760 --> 41:13.638
- What do you need?
- It will pass.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.390
It's funny.

41:16.391 --> 41:19.560
All these fucking tapes
and trials...

41:19.561 --> 41:21.312
We spend all these time trying

41:21.313 --> 41:24.106
to stay one step
ahead of the game...

41:24.107 --> 41:26.484
But this fucking cancer...

41:27.694 --> 41:30.029
And it's the ultimate fuck you.

41:37.662 --> 41:40.248
I'm really not painted.

41:48.340 --> 41:50.216
You got something for me?

41:51.092 --> 41:52.278
You see this kid here?

41:52.302 --> 41:54.530
Used to give him 5 dollars,
he went to candy store.

41:54.554 --> 41:57.557
Now look at him, he's a fucking earner.

41:58.391 --> 42:01.060
Here.
Buy yourself a nice sports jacket.

42:01.061 --> 42:04.104
Because we are going to Binge tonight.

42:04.105 --> 42:05.523
Tonight, tonight.

42:07.776 --> 42:09.786
I'mma tell you something
about your old man.

42:10.362 --> 42:13.031
When he was sent off to Green
Haven on the McBratney thing,

42:13.406 --> 42:14.990
which you probably know about

42:14.991 --> 42:17.452
Carlo Gambino was so
grateful to your father

42:17.494 --> 42:20.121
for his service to him...

42:21.456 --> 42:24.416
He got him Roy
Cohn to defend him.

42:24.417 --> 42:27.545
Roy Conh, the biggest fucking
lawyer in the country.

42:28.255 --> 42:30.965
Your dad wasn't even a
main man at that time.

42:31.091 --> 42:33.217
Cohn, he makes a deal into plea...

42:33.218 --> 42:36.220
He gets it reduced to involuntary
manslaughter. And your dad's

42:36.221 --> 42:37.365
out in four.

42:37.389 --> 42:40.099
One of our people who know about this,

42:40.100 --> 42:42.894
how your dad going to
arrested in the first place.

42:43.103 --> 42:45.562
Your dad was lying low,
in the wind,

42:45.563 --> 42:47.933
he has to have this problem
with the Genovese family.

42:48.149 --> 42:49.210
He showed up.

42:49.234 --> 42:52.695
He receded up my behalf at a seat down
near here in Maspeth.

42:53.405 --> 42:56.616
And the FBI picket him up on
a tip-off as he was leaving.

42:58.410 --> 43:00.244
Loyalty cuts both ways for them.

43:00.245 --> 43:01.787
Your honor,

43:01.788 --> 43:04.331
the prosecution contains that Mr. Gotti

43:04.332 --> 43:06.583
is a clear and continuing
danger to the community.

43:06.584 --> 43:09.172
And in lieu of potential
life sentence in this case

43:09.196 --> 43:11.463
it would be imprudent
to grant him bail.

43:11.464 --> 43:12.566
Thank you, Miss Giacalone,

43:12.590 --> 43:15.552
but you have not convinced me
that Mr Gotti is a flight risk.

43:16.136 --> 43:18.971
Court grants bail on the
amount of one million dollars.

43:18.972 --> 43:22.031
Your honor, as the court has
granted bail for Mr Gotti

43:22.055 --> 43:23.828
we also request that there be set

43:23.852 --> 43:25.811
at a reasonable amount for Mr.
Johnson.

43:25.812 --> 43:28.106
Your honor, we have strong
reasons to believe

43:28.148 --> 43:30.376
that the defendant's life
will be in serious jeopardy

43:30.400 --> 43:33.361
- if he is granted bail.
- And why would that be?

43:45.915 --> 43:48.918
Because Wilfred Johnson
has been a confidential informant

43:48.960 --> 43:51.212
for the FBI for the past 19 years.

43:52.005 --> 43:54.298
- Order!
- Liar!

43:54.299 --> 43:56.759
- She is lying! I'll fucking kill you!
- Order!

43:57.719 --> 44:00.220
- You're going to kill me!
- You will have order.

44:00.221 --> 44:02.390
Counsel, restrain your client.

44:03.058 --> 44:08.021
In light of that information if confirmed,
bail is denied on Johnson.

44:11.733 --> 44:13.610
I stand strong...

44:14.569 --> 44:18.656
I refuse to testify
and we win...

44:19.574 --> 44:22.619
Can I get a pass? I beg of you.

44:23.620 --> 44:25.288
Swear it.

44:26.206 --> 44:28.457
Swear it on your kid's grave.

44:28.458 --> 44:30.418
You won't kill me.

44:31.961 --> 44:34.255
How am I gonna kill a ghost?

44:43.098 --> 44:46.392
Me and Willy Boy Johnson
beat the case

44:46.434 --> 44:48.954
due to the lack of credibility
of the government's witness.

44:48.978 --> 44:53.858
Find the defendants John Joseph
Gotti and Wilfred Johnson not guilty.

44:55.110 --> 44:58.446
As for Willy Boy
it's another story.

45:00.949 --> 45:03.283
Dominic always took
charge of the fireworks.

45:03.284 --> 45:05.035
He's not kidding.

45:05.036 --> 45:08.497
It's my gift to that.
You do the fireworks the way I like you.

45:08.498 --> 45:10.458
That's not what I...

45:13.294 --> 45:15.879
- Look.
- I can not believe...

45:15.880 --> 45:18.633
- You would have some fun?
- Let's go have some fun.

45:20.760 --> 45:22.136
Is there a problem here?

45:22.137 --> 45:24.990
We are shutting it down Gotti.
This is an un-permitted street gathering.

45:25.014 --> 45:26.784
And illegal fireworks at this premises.

45:26.808 --> 45:30.227
What are you talking about?
We've been doing this for 20 years.

45:30.228 --> 45:32.632
Let me ask you something.
You gonna put these good people in jail

45:32.656 --> 45:34.083
because they are
proud of their country?

45:34.107 --> 45:36.483
Is that right? You got
my lawyer on the phone?

45:36.484 --> 45:38.295
- He is standing by.
- You got bail money?

45:38.319 --> 45:39.611
With interests.

45:39.612 --> 45:41.114
Send them up!

45:57.297 --> 45:59.507
This is your turf, John.

46:07.515 --> 46:09.767
Look at this. I'm good at my deal.

46:10.268 --> 46:11.686
Go ahead, taste.

46:15.356 --> 46:17.525
It's not bad. I know.

46:21.070 --> 46:22.530
Hey. Excuse me.

46:23.114 --> 46:25.491
I don't normally do this, but
I saw you walking over.

46:25.492 --> 46:29.536
I'd hate myself the rest of my life
if I don't come and talk to you.

46:29.537 --> 46:31.147
Stop it, Johnny, you're not funny.

46:31.998 --> 46:34.185
- Wait, do we know each other?
- What? You lose your memory

46:34.209 --> 46:36.210
at the military academy or something?

46:37.629 --> 46:39.630
It's me. Kim.

46:40.089 --> 46:42.550
Come on John! Joey Rugs' daughter!

46:43.760 --> 46:45.052
I'm sorry. It's just...

46:45.053 --> 46:47.513
You looked different.

46:47.931 --> 46:49.515
Guess I grew up.

46:49.807 --> 46:51.559
I guess you did.

46:54.854 --> 46:56.647
You wanna get a beer or something?

46:57.148 --> 46:59.066
John, I'm 16.

47:01.069 --> 47:03.029
You wanna get a soda?

47:03.488 --> 47:04.781
Yeah, that sounds nice.

47:05.114 --> 47:06.574
Alright. Let's go.

47:08.618 --> 47:10.161
See you.

47:10.328 --> 47:12.371
Joey Rugs...

47:13.373 --> 47:16.417
Paul wants to see you.
And I hold him back as long as I can.

47:16.626 --> 47:18.795
The fucking Angelo Tapes again?

47:18.836 --> 47:21.338
It's got nothing to do with Angelo.

47:21.339 --> 47:23.090
Paul has decided to break up

47:23.091 --> 47:24.383
your crew.

47:26.219 --> 47:29.388
He's gonna break up the crew?
The fuck does that mean?

47:29.389 --> 47:30.722
If Paul goes to prison,

47:30.723 --> 47:33.453
he wants to make sure
that everybody knows he's still the boss.

47:33.601 --> 47:36.311
It's like Carlo fucking
Gambino all over again.

47:36.312 --> 47:38.730
Everyone knows that it
should have been you.

47:38.731 --> 47:41.775
What you want and what we get
are 2 different things.

47:41.776 --> 47:44.266
Well, he wants reassurance. Forget
about it. No, he will get it.

47:44.290 --> 47:46.966
You better fucking agree with him.
Or at least look like you do.

47:46.990 --> 47:48.407
He doesn't deserve it, Neil!

47:48.408 --> 47:51.493
Look, you gotta earn yours
like we did.

47:51.494 --> 47:54.538
- What world are you living in?
- All fucking Paul is

47:54.539 --> 47:56.433
about his money.
That's his get off. That's it.

47:56.457 --> 48:00.199
- Coming from a fucking degenerate gambler.
- You are goddamn right.

48:00.200 --> 48:01.511
Can't take it with you.

48:08.219 --> 48:09.738
If Paul makes a move on Angelo...

48:09.762 --> 48:12.974
You'll live with it.
If he gives you that choice.

48:13.182 --> 48:16.060
There is no choice.
There is only what you do.

48:16.144 --> 48:19.146
Listen to me.
You kill the boss's boss...

48:19.188 --> 48:20.606
I will defend my position.

48:20.607 --> 48:23.002
- You will bring down hellfire.
- I'll do what I gotta do.

48:23.026 --> 48:25.570
Not as long as I'm alive.

48:28.823 --> 48:30.199
Jesus...

48:30.742 --> 48:34.203
I can't get over Willy Boy.

48:36.789 --> 48:39.125
Shows that life is full of surprises.

48:39.959 --> 48:43.087
He's been with you since
Fulton Rockaway boys huh?

48:43.755 --> 48:46.006
A bunch of punk kids

48:46.007 --> 48:48.068
who had the balls to take
on one of my poker game.

48:48.092 --> 48:49.760
You never know.

48:49.761 --> 48:51.595
He broke my fucking heart.

48:51.596 --> 48:53.180
You gave him a pass?

48:56.267 --> 48:59.186
Attack from the outside,
you can deal with.

48:59.187 --> 49:02.607
But attack from the inside...
you're history.

49:03.191 --> 49:06.818
Once you take that first step,
there is no turning back.

49:06.819 --> 49:10.781
You either succeed, or you
are lost in enemy territory.

49:10.782 --> 49:13.409
And if you miss, you die.

49:14.077 --> 49:16.162
And all your friends will die.

49:17.538 --> 49:19.749
So you will need DeCicco.

49:20.416 --> 49:22.394
If he is on board, then
Joe Piney would join you.

49:22.418 --> 49:26.547
He will take care of the old timers.
And Gallo will go along.

49:29.008 --> 49:33.095
"The Lord is my shepherd."

49:33.846 --> 49:37.350
He maketh me to lie down
in the green grass...

49:37.517 --> 49:40.769
He leadeth me beside the still waters

49:40.770 --> 49:43.105
he restoreth my soul.

49:43.106 --> 49:46.108
He leadeth me in the path of righteousness

49:46.109 --> 49:47.901
for his name sake.

49:47.902 --> 49:51.906
Either I walk through the
valley of shadow of death,

49:51.948 --> 49:53.950
I will fear no evil,

49:54.200 --> 49:56.452
for thou art with me.

50:03.042 --> 50:04.919
In the presence of my enemies.

50:23.271 --> 50:24.641
In the name of the Father...

50:25.648 --> 50:28.401
Obviously Paul couldn't make it, but
he sends his prayers.

50:45.460 --> 50:47.043
Let me tell you something.

50:47.044 --> 50:50.589
Neil could have taken the family
from Paul anytime he wanted.

50:50.965 --> 50:52.258
Everybody knows that.

50:52.383 --> 50:54.885
Paul, up on there, the hill.

50:54.886 --> 50:57.888
We gotta kiss his ring
like he was the pope.

50:57.889 --> 50:59.181
Fuck pope.

51:00.892 --> 51:03.936
I hear you. I am with you.

51:15.114 --> 51:17.074
You will need DeCicco.

51:17.575 --> 51:19.553
If he is on board then
Joe Piney will join you.

51:19.577 --> 51:21.662
He will take care of the old timers.

51:23.289 --> 51:25.207
And Gallo would go along.

51:25.792 --> 51:28.338
D.B. is important he was through
that all the rough ventures and

51:28.362 --> 51:31.148
make sure that everybody knows
it's only business we are talking.

51:31.172 --> 51:34.508
But you are gonna need the approval
of the other families.

51:34.509 --> 51:38.113
Franck and Sammy Bull
will represent Brooklyn.

51:38.137 --> 51:41.640
The Lucchese won't be a problem.
You got Pescuchi on your side,

51:41.641 --> 51:44.434
so the Bonnanos, we
are not worried about.

51:44.435 --> 51:46.853
Leave the Colombos to Angelo.

51:46.854 --> 51:50.399
He will fill the pause with
Freddy DeVico and Benny Cans.

51:50.775 --> 51:52.568
And that leaves The Chin.

51:52.819 --> 51:54.111
Chin...

51:54.445 --> 51:57.031
Do you think I am
stickler for the rules?

51:57.156 --> 51:59.241
Chin will not be happy no matter what.

51:59.325 --> 52:01.201
But he will be outnumbered so...

52:01.202 --> 52:04.120
We could have a peaceful transition
he will just have to accept.

52:04.121 --> 52:06.873
I dunno.
Paul and Chin are pretty tight.

52:06.874 --> 52:08.227
They got lot of money on the street.

52:08.251 --> 52:09.960
You'll take care of that after.

52:09.961 --> 52:12.587
You use D.B. for that...
Now listen,

52:12.588 --> 52:15.423
No body has gotten in on Chin's act.

52:15.424 --> 52:18.385
On the contrary, with Paul out of the way,
with Chins

52:18.386 --> 52:19.738
free and clear

52:19.762 --> 52:22.472
I have no doubt that the other
families will back you.

52:22.473 --> 52:24.934
But only if you have support
of all five bureaus.

52:25.184 --> 52:27.978
Queens, Brooklyn, Manhattan,

52:27.979 --> 52:30.564
Staten Island, the Bronx.

52:32.024 --> 52:34.068
Ain't that a fist?

52:40.825 --> 52:42.826
So it comes down to:

52:42.827 --> 52:44.160
is what you wanna be?

52:44.161 --> 52:48.748
You wanna be on the boss?

52:48.749 --> 52:51.460
Because we are gonna do this thing.
We are gonna do it right.

52:51.502 --> 52:54.797
It's gonna be Cosa Nostra,
the Cosa Nostra till I die.

52:55.548 --> 52:57.049
Atta-boys, John.

52:59.302 --> 53:02.138
Paul has set up a
dinner next Thursday.

53:02.221 --> 53:03.848
Friends only.

53:04.056 --> 53:08.352
To discuss the reorganization
of the family.

53:14.025 --> 53:18.320
December 16, 1985

53:20.406 --> 53:22.073
We are on a piece of work.

53:22.074 --> 53:24.910
It's a big job. There
is no 2 ways about it.

53:24.911 --> 53:26.703
It's gotta be done.

53:26.704 --> 53:28.455
Get them their coats and hats.

53:31.834 --> 53:34.002
Hats is all anyone's gonna remember seeing.

53:34.003 --> 53:35.689
We are on the corner
from the United Nations.

53:35.713 --> 53:37.441
They will take the fucking
Russians are coming.

53:37.465 --> 53:39.884
Listen up. Pay attention.

53:40.927 --> 53:42.303
We are hitting Paul.

53:49.977 --> 53:51.787
And anyone else is in the car with him.

54:02.490 --> 54:04.950
It's gonna take place
at Sparks Steak House.

54:10.706 --> 54:13.292
That's up on 46th, between 2nd and 3rd.

54:17.004 --> 54:18.315
He has a 6 o'clock reservation.

54:18.339 --> 54:19.589
At 18 o'clock.

54:23.177 --> 54:24.511
There is gonna be a lot of

54:24.512 --> 54:27.681
Christmas shoppers,
but that's perfect for us.

54:31.018 --> 54:32.788
We are gonna get in and out in a zing,

54:32.812 --> 54:34.813
like the Pittsburgh Steelers.

54:36.190 --> 54:38.692
It's to kill or be killed.

54:38.693 --> 54:40.152
Let's go.

55:12.852 --> 55:14.645
- How you doing?
- Good.

55:16.564 --> 55:18.481
A whiskey and ice please.

55:18.482 --> 55:19.775
So, Franck...

55:20.901 --> 55:23.362
this business with the Gotti's crew..

55:24.405 --> 55:26.240
It's very troublesome to Paul.

55:37.793 --> 55:39.670
I know you like John.

55:39.962 --> 55:41.629
Hell, I like to.

55:41.630 --> 55:43.191
Now that Neil's out of the picture,

55:43.215 --> 55:44.842
Paul just wants to...

55:45.676 --> 55:47.720
shake the whole registration.

56:00.232 --> 56:02.202
And he wants you to be comfortable with it.

56:06.197 --> 56:07.656
Paul is late.

56:12.119 --> 56:13.369
Paul is here.

56:15.372 --> 56:17.791
He's not gonna make dinner.

56:25.216 --> 56:26.675
We gotta go.

56:50.866 --> 56:53.993
This assassination of Paul Castellano,

56:53.994 --> 56:57.956
has local and federal officials looking for
the men who did it and for the motive.

56:58.415 --> 57:00.723
Finding either are both
extremely difficult,

57:00.747 --> 57:02.896
given the secrecy
of organized crime.

57:02.920 --> 57:05.839
We may never know why
Castellano was killed.

57:05.840 --> 57:08.383
Louis Young is standing
by in Staten Island,

57:08.384 --> 57:10.177
at the Castellano home.

57:11.095 --> 57:14.139
Mafia kingpin Paul
"Big" Paul Castellano,

57:14.140 --> 57:17.809
was gunned down gangland style
in midtown, Manhattan.

57:17.810 --> 57:19.887
The 70 year old, reputed,
head of the largest and

57:19.911 --> 57:22.022
the most powerful crime
family in the country,

57:22.064 --> 57:23.523
the Gambino family.

57:23.524 --> 57:24.709
Uncle Ang?

57:24.733 --> 57:25.836
Where is my father?

57:25.860 --> 57:27.796
- He's gonna be here soon.
- Is everything OK?

57:27.820 --> 57:29.237
He is OK.

57:29.238 --> 57:30.948
I learned for Paul.

57:32.575 --> 57:35.076
It would be a terrible
mistake to think that

57:35.077 --> 57:38.705
this is a good time going
around and shooting up people.

57:38.706 --> 57:40.456
He is on a jet,
he's over Iceland

57:40.457 --> 57:44.128
and the stewardess comes up and she says:
"My name is Pussy Galore".

57:44.628 --> 57:46.880
He says: "I must be dreaming."

57:53.345 --> 57:54.847
Fellas...

57:57.766 --> 57:59.977
We don't know who killed Paul and Tommy.

58:00.352 --> 58:01.979
But we are gonna find out.

58:02.646 --> 58:04.522
Conduct our investigation,

58:04.523 --> 58:06.358
get to the bottom of this.

58:07.067 --> 58:08.777
That being said...

58:09.904 --> 58:13.282
our job is now to maintain continuity.

58:14.992 --> 58:18.578
Make sure nobody thinks
family is falling apart here.

58:18.579 --> 58:19.872
So...

58:21.540 --> 58:23.167
I nominate...

58:24.376 --> 58:25.794
John Gotti.

58:33.427 --> 58:34.928
I second the motion.

58:52.780 --> 58:54.030
To the new boss!

59:20.516 --> 59:22.059
Here he is.

59:22.935 --> 59:24.728
Congratulations, John.

59:31.777 --> 59:33.237
How does it feel?

59:33.737 --> 59:36.698
Feels like times have changed.
It's good.

59:36.782 --> 59:38.866
I mean how does it feel to be here?

59:38.867 --> 59:40.827
This was Neil's joint.

59:40.828 --> 59:42.013
It feels right.

59:42.037 --> 59:44.789
It feels like it's what
he would have wanted.

59:44.790 --> 59:47.167
It feels...

59:47.584 --> 59:50.337
Wherever he is, he is watching us.

59:53.048 --> 59:54.674
Yeah. And he ain't the only one.

59:54.675 --> 59:56.125
I'll talk to you about that...

59:56.635 --> 59:59.846
Nick Vilante's widow lives
upstairs.

01:00:00.055 --> 01:00:02.181
We can't take her out on the street,

01:00:02.182 --> 01:00:04.934
but if we have a serious conversation

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:08.563
or she whining or it's annoying, we give
a little something,

01:00:08.564 --> 01:00:11.024
she vacates the premise for 20 minutes

01:00:11.025 --> 01:00:13.443
and then we take care of it.

01:00:16.739 --> 01:00:19.491
I would like some
to clear the floor.

01:00:21.744 --> 01:00:24.413
Let them know.
Let everybody know.

01:00:25.664 --> 01:00:28.750
Now, everybody comes to me.
They come to me.

01:00:35.341 --> 01:00:36.633
"The new godfather"

01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:41.471
John Gotti has been the most
note-worthy figure

01:00:41.472 --> 01:00:42.889
in the last 50 years.

01:00:45.684 --> 01:00:48.811
The head of the Gambino crime
family, a real life godfather.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:50.688
Shots fired here before the Steak house,

01:00:50.689 --> 01:00:52.691
were heard around the world.

01:00:55.527 --> 01:00:57.737
People shout at me from cars:

01:00:57.738 --> 01:01:00.448
"Say hello to John!"

01:01:00.449 --> 01:01:02.742
The most powerful crime boss in America.

01:01:02.743 --> 01:01:06.113
Does he glorify the Mafia? Yeah. He's
glorified the Mafia. He's the headhunter.

01:01:12.461 --> 01:01:14.277
If I have to go to
another fucking wedding

01:01:14.301 --> 01:01:16.280
I think I'd rather go
back to Lewisberg.

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:19.486
Jesus, everybody

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:23.054
have been there. There was good-fellas,
there was non good-fellas.

01:01:23.055 --> 01:01:25.306
My brother Pete clocked, 75 guys

01:01:25.307 --> 01:01:26.599
come up to me.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.810
Those 75 guys come up to talk to me

01:01:28.811 --> 01:01:31.020
but they got nothing to offer me.

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:32.890
Conversation, if
conversation is the cow it'd

01:01:32.914 --> 01:01:34.858
be the fattest fucking guy in in the world.

01:01:37.277 --> 01:01:38.612
Jesus...

01:01:45.786 --> 01:01:47.079
Rudy?

01:01:47.496 --> 01:01:48.681
Can I talk to you a minute?

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:49.998
Yeah, John.

01:01:58.298 --> 01:02:01.008
You deliver the envelope
to Dominic's wife yesterday?

01:02:01.009 --> 01:02:02.760
Yeah, just like you told me.

01:02:02.761 --> 01:02:04.887
No. Not just like I told you.

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:07.348
- I dropped it off.
- Who did you bring with you?

01:02:07.349 --> 01:02:09.100
Well, I was gonna bring my niece...

01:02:09.101 --> 01:02:11.185
But you didn't. You didn't.
One simple rule.

01:02:11.186 --> 01:02:14.230
Don't you ever go to a guy's
house while he's away

01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:15.731
and see his wife alone.

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:17.400
And if you ever do this again,

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:20.695
I'll perk a bus upon your
ass fucking sideways!

01:02:20.696 --> 01:02:21.946
You understand that?

01:02:21.989 --> 01:02:23.281
Yeah, John.

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.660
Sorry, John.

01:02:27.536 --> 01:02:28.829
Sorry.

01:02:45.596 --> 01:02:47.264
Stay seated.

01:02:50.476 --> 01:02:52.310
John's getting too much press.

01:02:53.061 --> 01:02:54.312
Ought to learn to duck.

01:02:54.313 --> 01:02:56.772
He's got too much pride to duck.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:59.343
If he don't give a fuck
he's gonna die in jail, the gutter.

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:02.696
Making us look bad.

01:03:03.071 --> 01:03:04.740
Then this DeCicco...

01:03:04.948 --> 01:03:07.576
We know he arranged the hit on Paul.

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:09.995
That can't go unchecked.

01:03:10.287 --> 01:03:14.499
Otherwise, we got capos working their
left N right in home.

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:16.668
Not now, not ever.

01:03:42.945 --> 01:03:44.321
Frankie!

01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:51.161
Frank! Frankie!

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:01.797
Whore!

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:13.141
It was meant for you.

01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:14.893
What are you talking about?

01:04:15.102 --> 01:04:18.229
I am telling you it was,
you know who did it.

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:20.482
I heard it on good authority.

01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:24.527
He and Gas pipe Casso are like
two piece in a fucking pie.

01:04:24.528 --> 01:04:27.178
Who heard... You heard! Your ears
are bigger than your mouth.

01:04:27.489 --> 01:04:29.907
OK first of all, I'm friends with Chin.

01:04:29.908 --> 01:04:32.243
Sam and Pipe go way back, am I right Sam?

01:04:32.244 --> 01:04:33.703
Am I right Sam?

01:04:33.704 --> 01:04:36.954
What? And they are all grieving about Paul?
Why would they grieve about Paul?

01:04:36.957 --> 01:04:40.334
Look, whoever killed Paul

01:04:40.335 --> 01:04:42.378
did everybody a fucking favor.

01:04:42.379 --> 01:04:45.316
Maybe it was the cops, yeah, you know.
They put us against each other.

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:47.968
That's what they want us to believe.
Am I right?

01:04:48.302 --> 01:04:50.177
Let's take care of business.

01:04:50.178 --> 01:04:52.848
Angelo tried to take matters
into his own hands.

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:55.891
With an unsanctioned hit
on Gas pipe Casso.

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:57.936
That didn't workout too well for nobody.

01:05:00.522 --> 01:05:02.482
- Gas pipe?
- Who the fuck are you?

01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:43.731
Good guys, bad guys,

01:05:43.732 --> 01:05:46.693
come in many different colors.
New York's finest

01:05:46.735 --> 01:05:49.362
serving 2 masters.

01:06:20.102 --> 01:06:21.811
I got all day.

01:06:23.271 --> 01:06:24.814
I got whole week.

01:06:26.066 --> 01:06:27.650
My man, it's just me and you.

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:30.612
We are just, hanging out in the basement.

01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:32.697
Just give me a name.

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:35.992
Tell me who it was.

01:06:44.543 --> 01:06:46.294
That hurts, doesn't it?

01:06:49.005 --> 01:06:50.757
I can make it stop.

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:53.969
I can make it all go away.

01:06:56.221 --> 01:06:57.806
Give me a name.

01:06:58.557 --> 01:07:00.141
Angelo Ruggierio.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.353
Angelo Ruggierio.

01:07:03.395 --> 01:07:04.688
Thank you.

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:06.481
Thank you very much.

01:07:12.904 --> 01:07:14.406
You handle it,

01:07:14.906 --> 01:07:17.533
Angelo try to whack another
main guy without permission?

01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:19.118
You got no proof of that.

01:07:19.119 --> 01:07:21.078
The shooter need a little encouragement,

01:07:21.079 --> 01:07:23.914
but he told Gas pipe,
he named Angelo.

01:07:23.915 --> 01:07:26.333
And there is no reason to disbelief it.

01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:28.419
Do I believe everything I hear?
No!

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:30.713
So I'm gonna do my own
investigation in this.

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:32.048
Oh yeah?

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:34.759
How's the other investigation going?

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.654
Heard anything about the
Sparks Steak House?

01:07:36.678 --> 01:07:40.098
Yeah. Their Caesar salad
is to die for.

01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:45.186
Angelo has been asking for this a long
time. There is no dispute about that.

01:07:45.187 --> 01:07:46.896
Let me tell you something Chin.

01:07:46.897 --> 01:07:50.357
Nobody touches Angelo. Nobody.

01:07:50.358 --> 01:07:52.902
If it's true that he acted
without my approval,

01:07:52.903 --> 01:07:55.697
I'll put him on a fucking shelf like that.

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:59.408
I know Angelo's more than a brother to you.
But Angelo went off the record.

01:07:59.409 --> 01:08:01.053
- This was unsanctioned.
- OK. But let me tell you something.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:04.830
Life means more than anything to Angelo.

01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:06.207
OK. He is a war horse.

01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:09.044
It means more than it does to you or to me.

01:08:09.503 --> 01:08:11.814
He wakes up thinking about it,
he goes to bed thinking about it.

01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:14.965
If I put him on a shelf for life
it's worse than putting a fucking

01:08:14.966 --> 01:08:16.885
bullet through his heart.

01:08:19.345 --> 01:08:20.930
Then I vow to close this matter.

01:08:21.807 --> 01:08:23.640
The matter is closed.

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:25.077
The last time

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:28.229
they moved me John, do you know
the only thing I took with me?

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.566
Your indictment. That was it.

01:08:32.567 --> 01:08:36.529
And do you know why I brought it? Because
I don't give a fuck about my cancer.

01:08:36.529 --> 01:08:40.241
I don't care what they do to me in here.
My concerns are you.

01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:42.220
I know that.

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:45.330
I must have read it 50 times
and I tell you I don't see it.

01:08:45.913 --> 01:08:48.416
I told you once I would
follow you over at cliff.

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:50.917
And I meant it.
But I am thinking about my family now.

01:08:50.919 --> 01:08:54.546
Your family? What family are you talking
about? You talking about your 400

01:08:54.548 --> 01:08:56.216
brothers, cousins and uncles?

01:08:56.466 --> 01:09:00.136
Being a man is not being some guy
who is looking for closure, John.

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:02.095
My freedom and my life

01:09:02.096 --> 01:09:04.182
take a back seat to my duty
and manhood.

01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:06.768
These are my standards, John.

01:09:07.102 --> 01:09:09.645
OK, now listen up. This is important.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.981
Never do anyone a small injury.

01:09:11.982 --> 01:09:13.482
You wanna hurt someone,

01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:16.652
hurt him so bad
he will never come back at you.

01:09:16.653 --> 01:09:20.156
Neil used to say to me:
"The boss is the boss is the boss."

01:09:20.948 --> 01:09:23.117
It ain't titles that honor men.

01:09:23.118 --> 01:09:25.328
It's men that honor titles.

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:50.353
What did you do?

01:09:56.651 --> 01:10:00.738
I did what I thought was best for you.

01:10:03.283 --> 01:10:04.951
I save your life Ang.

01:10:05.035 --> 01:10:06.703
I all I can do.

01:10:07.913 --> 01:10:09.330
Son of a bitch killed Frank!

01:10:12.292 --> 01:10:13.792
I am not going to war

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:16.629
with the Chin for the sake
of Gas pipe fucking Casso.

01:10:16.838 --> 01:10:18.339
I ain't doing it.

01:10:18.757 --> 01:10:20.382
Now listen to you

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:22.746
Just 10 kinds of
shitstorms coming down

01:10:22.770 --> 01:10:25.156
on us and you know
what I had to do?

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:27.723
We had to have a meeting
with the Commission.

01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:30.643
Why? Because of you. Because of you!

01:10:33.647 --> 01:10:36.816
Every boss wanted you dead.

01:10:37.067 --> 01:10:38.359
Everyone.

01:10:40.487 --> 01:10:42.488
You're on the shelf for life.

01:10:42.489 --> 01:10:43.781
That's it.

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:45.240
Go.

01:11:46.845 --> 01:11:47.863
Get out of here.

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:50.014
Uncle Ang, he needs you.

01:11:50.557 --> 01:11:51.659
He made a big fucking mistake.

01:11:51.683 --> 01:11:54.643
Don't say another word. Don't you say
one word against your father.

01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:56.187
You hear me?

01:12:00.025 --> 01:12:01.317
You hear me?

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:16.350
I was forced.

01:12:16.374 --> 01:12:19.085
I can not treat him
differently than others.

01:12:19.210 --> 01:12:22.504
If I let you violate my rules,

01:12:22.505 --> 01:12:25.675
the very principles that we live by,

01:12:25.717 --> 01:12:28.845
it weakens me and that weakens you.

01:12:29.179 --> 01:12:32.307
Now, one day, you may be the shot caller,
you may be the one,

01:12:32.348 --> 01:12:34.962
there is making the rules,
and then you would be responsible

01:12:34.986 --> 01:12:37.895
for enforcing those rules.
You know what I'm saying?

01:12:37.896 --> 01:12:39.772
You give me my middle name Angelo.

01:12:39.773 --> 01:12:42.025
How do you expect me to
turn my back on him?

01:12:44.069 --> 01:12:47.739
You pray that I don't know about it.

01:12:50.450 --> 01:12:51.868
I love him too.

01:12:53.203 --> 01:12:54.495
Go to bed.

01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:04.797
Who cares if he goes to see Angelo?

01:13:04.798 --> 01:13:07.049
It's not like John's a part of that life.

01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:08.843
Victoria, please...

01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:10.219
Don't start. OK?

01:13:32.659 --> 01:13:34.577
Will the defendant please rise?

01:13:37.705 --> 01:13:39.665
Has the jury reached a verdict?

01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.336
"We, the jurors, in the above case"

01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:48.132
"find the defendant, John
Joseph Gotti, not guilty."

01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:50.968
I won this trial
fair and square.

01:13:50.969 --> 01:13:53.679
Thanks to little down payment
to one of the jurors.

01:13:53.888 --> 01:13:57.100
But by 3rd victory over the government,
the media nicknamed me

01:13:57.142 --> 01:13:58.767
"The Teflon God".

01:13:58.768 --> 01:13:59.727
I guess it stuck.

01:13:59.728 --> 01:14:01.353
Mr Gotti, are you the head of the

01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:03.522
- Gambino crime family?
- I'm head of my family.

01:14:03.523 --> 01:14:05.376
Ms Gotti, do you know what your
husband does for a living?

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:07.026
He provides.

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:43.729
- Do you know why we're here?
- No.

01:14:46.858 --> 01:14:48.828
- Do you know everybody in this room?
- Yes.

01:14:51.321 --> 01:14:53.072
This is a society of brothers.

01:14:53.448 --> 01:14:55.116
The Cosa Nostra.

01:14:55.158 --> 01:14:56.867
You are now about to be inducted as

01:14:56.868 --> 01:14:58.953
a member of the Gambino family.

01:14:59.579 --> 01:15:01.955
Honor this oath. If you divulge

01:15:01.956 --> 01:15:04.666
any secret of
this family, your soul

01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:06.084
will burn like this saint.

01:15:06.085 --> 01:15:09.922
Never raise your hands made man.
Or quote with the made man's wife

01:15:09.923 --> 01:15:11.775
you will be killed.
You don't fuck with bums,

01:15:11.799 --> 01:15:14.134
engage the civilians.

01:15:14.135 --> 01:15:16.553
Use of drugs, prohibited.
Lastly,

01:15:16.554 --> 01:15:18.306
most importantly
we don't like rats.

01:15:19.766 --> 01:15:21.142
We kill rats.

01:15:22.393 --> 01:15:25.603
You are questioned by law enforcement?
You tell them to go fuck themselves.

01:15:27.315 --> 01:15:28.815
You are now reborn.

01:15:28.816 --> 01:15:30.443
This is your baptism.

01:15:30.902 --> 01:15:32.487
And we are your family.

01:15:34.906 --> 01:15:36.199
Come here.

01:16:02.517 --> 01:16:04.893
I would like you to meet your new soldier.

01:16:04.894 --> 01:16:06.395
This is your boss. Your chief.

01:16:10.525 --> 01:16:12.485
This is the proudest moment of my life.

01:16:16.239 --> 01:16:18.491
I am so fucking proud of you.

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:24.329
Look at us!

01:16:24.372 --> 01:16:25.790
Look at us!

01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:32.880
Hey.

01:16:34.632 --> 01:16:36.175
Come on.

01:16:37.885 --> 01:16:39.178
Hi Elisa...

01:16:46.144 --> 01:16:47.686
Johnny.

01:16:47.687 --> 01:16:50.605
Like I said, it's getting tougher.
It's not getting easier.

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:54.234
You look around you. You got a
few good soldiers, am I right?

01:16:54.235 --> 01:16:55.963
- Yeah dad, I think you are right.
- OK.

01:16:55.987 --> 01:16:59.823
But this is not the time to make 20 bucks.
You know what kind of guys I need?

01:16:59.824 --> 01:17:02.576
I need guys
that do more than just kill

01:17:02.577 --> 01:17:05.370
I need guys whose hearts
beat the same,

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:06.747
otherwise, this won't work.

01:17:06.748 --> 01:17:09.750
And the law is coming down hard on us.
You know that.

01:17:09.751 --> 01:17:11.004
Of course, if it comes to worse,

01:17:11.028 --> 01:17:12.980
we could find you a safe house,
get you out of the country.

01:17:13.004 --> 01:17:14.838
I don't run.

01:17:14.839 --> 01:17:16.757
And I don't hide in shadows either.

01:17:16.758 --> 01:17:19.885
You know what I need?
I need one year on the street uninterrupted

01:17:19.886 --> 01:17:22.888
and I will build something
that nobody can destroy,

01:17:22.889 --> 01:17:27.351
100 years from now, we are both dead but it
will be and continue to be a good thing.

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:30.062
Being one hell of a legacy to leave.

01:17:30.063 --> 01:17:33.024
A legacy. Be it
an hour from now, be it tonight

01:17:33.066 --> 01:17:36.485
be it a 100 years from now, when we're
gone, it will be the Cosa Nostra.

01:17:36.486 --> 01:17:39.048
And I'm not talking about the gangs,
I'm not talking about clans.

01:17:39.072 --> 01:17:43.034
I'm talking about New York, far to
the fucking west coast and back.

01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:45.536
It's gonna be the way
I say it's gonna be.

01:17:49.082 --> 01:17:51.500
About a year after I put him on a shelf

01:17:51.501 --> 01:17:54.211
Angelo Ruggierio died of cancer.

01:17:54.212 --> 01:17:57.172
Ang... I know I hurt you.

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:58.840
But you've fucked up.

01:17:58.841 --> 01:18:02.386
And I had to do
what was best for the family.

01:18:05.264 --> 01:18:06.556
Frankly,

01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:08.851
I think he died of a broken heart.

01:18:16.567 --> 01:18:18.610
By the way, I almost forgot...

01:18:18.611 --> 01:18:22.365
Sammy thinks that you should
be running your own crew now.

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.742
Your credit to your father..

01:18:25.743 --> 01:18:29.580
Normally I don't show you no favor, but
this time, I'mma help you out.

01:18:29.622 --> 01:18:31.790
I'mma hand pick your crew.

01:18:31.791 --> 01:18:34.919
I'mma give you Bobby.
Because I trust him with my life.

01:18:35.253 --> 01:18:37.254
And I trust him with your life.

01:18:37.255 --> 01:18:39.631
- Is that okay with Bobby?
- Go ask.

01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:42.300
What? Be under a little punk like you?

01:18:42.301 --> 01:18:44.512
Holy Virgin... never in life.

01:18:44.971 --> 01:18:46.722
It's you, the boss, now.

01:18:46.848 --> 01:18:48.765
You say the word, I will go for a...

01:18:48.766 --> 01:18:51.056
You are already hurt, you're
getting married today.

01:18:58.693 --> 01:19:00.152
Yeah. Where is Victoria?

01:19:05.616 --> 01:19:07.118
Hey. Good to see you.

01:19:08.161 --> 01:19:09.453
Congratulations.

01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:11.539
Congratulations.

01:19:11.956 --> 01:19:13.749
Nice work, John. Nice work.

01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:17.211
Vic?

01:19:17.962 --> 01:19:19.547
Hello. How is it going?

01:19:19.839 --> 01:19:22.007
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

01:21:37.643 --> 01:21:41.689
"Neil used to say:
This life of ours is a wonderful life."

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:46.026
"If we can get away with it."

01:21:46.694 --> 01:21:50.655
The man some people consider to be
organized crime's boss of all bosses,

01:21:50.656 --> 01:21:53.908
John Gotti, was indicted today for
the 4th time in 5 years.

01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:56.077
Gotti is charged with the 1985 murder

01:21:56.078 --> 01:22:00.206
of the mob boss Paul Castellano.
The prosecutors hopes their best testimony,

01:22:00.207 --> 01:22:02.667
this time will come from
Gotti's own mouth.

01:22:02.668 --> 01:22:05.587
You look at me like I don't know who I am.
I am the new boss.

01:22:05.588 --> 01:22:08.883
I do whatever the fuck I want, without
stepping all the bounds.

01:22:08.966 --> 01:22:11.509
Now I'm telling you.
If something happens to me,

01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:14.512
and I end up in a can,
I want Sammy to be the acting boss.

01:22:14.513 --> 01:22:16.014
- Is that clear?
- Clear.

01:22:16.015 --> 01:22:17.265
These are my wishes.

01:22:17.391 --> 01:22:20.310
I would be a billionaire
if I was looking to be poor.

01:22:20.311 --> 01:22:22.312
All I want is this sandwich.

01:22:22.313 --> 01:22:25.815
Every time I fucking turn around,
there is a new company.

01:22:25.816 --> 01:22:28.318
Every time we got a partner
or the boss to fuck with us.

01:22:28.319 --> 01:22:30.029
We kill them...

01:22:32.156 --> 01:22:34.326
- He's a yellow dot.
- I took your word for, Sam.

01:22:34.617 --> 01:22:36.452
I allowed it to be done.

01:23:07.942 --> 01:23:10.193
Yeah he probably won't.
He is not gonna be here

01:23:10.194 --> 01:23:12.780
for breakfast.
They took him away the last night.

01:23:17.952 --> 01:23:19.369
Please give your name.

01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:20.995
Salvatore Gravano.

01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:22.331
Do they call you Salvatore?

01:23:23.749 --> 01:23:25.125
Sammy.

01:23:25.126 --> 01:23:27.816
Mr Gravano, could you please
speak in through the microphone.

01:23:29.296 --> 01:23:30.546
Sure.

01:23:31.215 --> 01:23:33.092
I didn't follow my own advice.

01:23:35.136 --> 01:23:36.594
Never trust anyone who

01:23:36.595 --> 01:23:38.304
hasn't done time.

01:23:38.305 --> 01:23:40.682
That's where men are made.

01:23:40.683 --> 01:23:43.685
Sammy the bull became Sammy the rat.

01:23:43.686 --> 01:23:47.147
The government cut him a deal after
admitting in his part in

01:23:47.148 --> 01:23:49.358
19 murders and
testifying against me.

01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:54.863
John Joseph Gotti,
you have been convicted on all counts of

01:23:54.864 --> 01:23:57.991
criminal racketeering, murder, and
conspiracy.

01:23:57.992 --> 01:24:02.162
You are hereby remanded to serve a
term of no less than 5 life sentences.

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:05.749
You will also be assessed
to 50 dollar court fee.

01:24:05.791 --> 01:24:07.667
Do you have anything to say?

01:24:07.668 --> 01:24:09.169
Yeah, your honor.

01:24:09.170 --> 01:24:11.421
The 5 life time bids, that's okay,

01:24:11.422 --> 01:24:15.384
but the 50 dollars surcharge...
You are a tough guy.

01:24:16.844 --> 01:24:20.013
Today... another milestone in the
fight against organized crime.

01:24:20.014 --> 01:24:21.931
The Teflon is gone

01:24:21.932 --> 01:24:26.186
the don is covered with Velcro
and every charge in the indictment stuck.

01:24:28.397 --> 01:24:29.916
Mayhem outside Brooklyn's
federal court house

01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:32.442
as John Gotti gets life.

01:24:32.443 --> 01:24:33.813
And his supporters cry foul.

01:24:36.197 --> 01:24:39.033
Demanding a retrial
they rushed police line...

01:24:39.283 --> 01:24:42.702
They pulled a lot of dirty tricks.
I don't believe there are witness.

01:24:42.703 --> 01:24:45.538
Then tried to break into the
court to free the mafia boss.

01:24:45.539 --> 01:24:48.500
He's a good guy.
He does a lot for the community, you know?

01:24:48.501 --> 01:24:49.751
Put him away for nothing.

01:24:50.127 --> 01:24:52.420
After today's arrest his supporters smashed

01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:55.048
and overturned cars.
The verdict on John Gotti

01:24:55.049 --> 01:24:56.884
is less likely to be overturned.

01:24:57.551 --> 01:24:59.062
Law enforcement officials
fear that a violent

01:24:59.086 --> 01:25:00.572
power struggle may happen
within Gotti's family.

01:25:00.596 --> 01:25:02.598
May happen within Gotti's family.

01:25:02.681 --> 01:25:06.434
And ironically, the only
one who may be able to keep the peace

01:25:06.435 --> 01:25:07.685
is John Gotti.

01:25:09.647 --> 01:25:11.565
My loyal crewman, Eddie Lino

01:25:11.941 --> 01:25:13.358
was the first to go down.

01:25:22.201 --> 01:25:25.621
Bobby Boriello, my closest
friend and my son's right arm

01:25:25.663 --> 01:25:26.955
was next.

01:25:29.917 --> 01:25:32.294
That's the life.
They understood that.

01:25:43.889 --> 01:25:45.306
What's going on?

01:25:45.307 --> 01:25:48.769
There is a contract out on me
and the rest of Sammy's crew.

01:25:49.562 --> 01:25:52.689
- Who's behind it?
- Jimmy Brown and Joey Fanatti.

01:25:54.233 --> 01:25:56.610
Jimmy Brown and Joey Fanatti...

01:25:59.530 --> 01:26:01.198
They are after you too Johnny.

01:26:05.411 --> 01:26:08.872
"Like father, like son".

01:26:10.583 --> 01:26:14.586
- Why are you pissed off?
- I had to read about it!

01:26:14.587 --> 01:26:16.212
It's on the cover of the paper!

01:26:16.213 --> 01:26:19.132
- What papers?
- Our son is a target!

01:26:19.133 --> 01:26:23.428
- The Daily News? The fucking post?
- Yeah the Daily News and the Post.

01:26:23.429 --> 01:26:25.305
I already buried a son.

01:26:25.306 --> 01:26:28.808
You want me to bury another
then you will bury me too.

01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:32.228
You swore to me in our own bed,

01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:35.148
you promised that you would not
bring him into that world.

01:26:35.149 --> 01:26:37.358
What world? What world
are you talking about?

01:26:37.359 --> 01:26:39.360
Tell me the world you're talking about!

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:42.614
I brought him into this world,
you brought him into the life.

01:26:43.073 --> 01:26:45.742
Ah come on, shut the fuck up!
You don't know what...

01:26:46.493 --> 01:26:48.287
Where are you going? Get back here!

01:26:48.829 --> 01:26:50.079
Fuck!

01:27:27.701 --> 01:27:31.371
I am not gonna beat around the bush.
I am gonna ask you a question.

01:27:31.413 --> 01:27:33.873
According to your answer, one
of us is gonna stand down.

01:27:33.874 --> 01:27:37.627
The chief ordered this?
No. So don't play dumb with me.

01:27:37.628 --> 01:27:39.689
This fucking nonsense about
Sammy's and his crew

01:27:39.713 --> 01:27:41.548
you telling me it came from my father?

01:27:42.716 --> 01:27:44.801
Then I suggest you stand down my friend.

01:27:44.802 --> 01:27:46.237
Oh, you're prepared to defend these guys?

01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:49.681
No. I am prepared to defend my father.
Whatever he says goes. Period.

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:07.824
Okay.

01:28:14.748 --> 01:28:19.377
Five organized crime families
are in a state of a

01:28:19.378 --> 01:28:23.214
New people are moving up taking the place
of the older ones who are now in prison

01:28:23.215 --> 01:28:24.841
or who ever killed.

01:28:29.972 --> 01:28:33.391
Locked up, or held under indictment,
virtually, every

01:28:33.392 --> 01:28:38.021
boss of every family in New York city
and throughout the US.

01:29:05.716 --> 01:29:07.718
You can't be fucking kidding me...

01:29:08.093 --> 01:29:09.383
What the hell is going on?

01:29:09.511 --> 01:29:12.001
What the hell is going on?
What do you think is going on?

01:29:12.056 --> 01:29:13.348
Jesus...

01:29:14.308 --> 01:29:15.892
Kids, come to daddy. Come here.

01:29:17.102 --> 01:29:19.938
I will be gone for a little while.

01:29:20.439 --> 01:29:21.815
Come here.

01:30:06.110 --> 01:30:09.154
Don't worry about daddy.
I will be back in a little while.

01:30:25.921 --> 01:30:27.630
We are today

01:30:27.631 --> 01:30:31.176
4 federal indictments
charging a total of 40 defenses

01:30:31.218 --> 01:30:34.554
with a wide spread pattern of
racketeering and other crimes

01:30:34.721 --> 01:30:37.849
including multiple extortion,
murder conspiracy,

01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:40.477
telecommunication fraud, illegal gambling,

01:30:40.519 --> 01:30:42.187
money laundering...

01:30:43.105 --> 01:30:47.316
Defendant's charge include, John A.
Gotti, also known as "Junior",

01:30:47.317 --> 01:30:49.902
who was alleged to have exercise

01:30:49.903 --> 01:30:53.489
supervisor control over the Gambino family

01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:56.284
since his father John J.
Gotti was convicted

01:30:56.285 --> 01:30:59.912
of federal racketeering charges in 1992.

01:30:59.913 --> 01:31:01.581
These are just bullshit charges.

01:31:01.999 --> 01:31:03.499
John, there's no way

01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:05.658
that they can tie you to
any of those specific crimes.

01:31:05.682 --> 01:31:06.771
They don't have to.

01:31:06.795 --> 01:31:08.721
It's the recoil conspiracy,
that's the problem.

01:31:08.745 --> 01:31:11.025
They just have to prove I'm
a member of the enterprise.

01:31:11.049 --> 01:31:12.652
- We can beat them.
- And then what?

01:31:12.676 --> 01:31:15.970
They just throw more charges at
me, like they did with my father.

01:31:15.971 --> 01:31:17.472
I've had enough.

01:31:17.764 --> 01:31:20.975
I have been pulling back.
I am ready to move on with my life.

01:31:20.976 --> 01:31:22.986
Are you saying what I'm
think you're saying?

01:31:28.442 --> 01:31:29.692
Alright.

01:31:38.785 --> 01:31:42.747
John, if that's what you want to do, if
you're ready to walk away from this life,

01:31:43.248 --> 01:31:44.309
I am happy for you.

01:31:44.333 --> 01:31:49.253
Just understand there are potential
consequences to that decision.

01:31:49.254 --> 01:31:52.173
And there gonna be people out there
who are gonna be very unhappy

01:31:52.174 --> 01:31:53.318
with the decision you make.

01:31:53.342 --> 01:31:57.137
That's why Charlie, you need to arrange
for me a meeting with my father.

01:31:57.679 --> 01:32:00.307
And he's is to come for me directly.
He is dying.

01:32:00.641 --> 01:32:02.350
He was my cause.

01:32:03.602 --> 01:32:06.605
Now it's time to move on.
I want closure.

01:32:09.107 --> 01:32:11.957
John, I got no cancer in my brain
and I got no cancer in my heart.

01:32:12.194 --> 01:32:16.239
But what I wouldn't do, to have one
more time to go into that court room

01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:19.034
and show them what a man
is, break their holes.

01:32:19.159 --> 01:32:21.244
You show them what a man in.

01:32:21.245 --> 01:32:23.413
You show them what it takes to have this.

01:32:29.378 --> 01:32:32.088
Now, we only got 5 minutes left.

01:32:33.090 --> 01:32:36.593
I don't know when or if
I will ever see you again.

01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:40.638
And I don't know if I got through
to you or not, but I know,

01:32:40.639 --> 01:32:42.724
you got a lot of thinking to do.

01:32:44.017 --> 01:32:45.393
I know.

01:32:48.272 --> 01:32:50.439
I miss seeing you, John.

01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:52.734
You have no idea how
much I miss seeing you.

01:32:53.235 --> 01:32:54.295
You know,

01:32:54.319 --> 01:32:56.154
this meeting, today,

01:32:56.530 --> 01:32:59.658
was worth 55 years
hanging upside down.

01:33:00.158 --> 01:33:02.576
Because now you know how I feel.

01:33:02.577 --> 01:33:05.121
I love you and I adore you...

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:06.998
I know.

01:33:07.874 --> 01:33:09.334
So...

01:33:13.338 --> 01:33:16.341
You do what you have to do.

01:33:16.383 --> 01:33:18.050
And don't worry about me.

01:33:18.051 --> 01:33:20.095
It doesn't make sense.

01:33:21.096 --> 01:33:22.681
What will be will be.

01:33:23.515 --> 01:33:26.685
You stand up strong, put your head up.

01:33:28.395 --> 01:33:29.813
Don't Cry.

01:33:29.855 --> 01:33:31.856
Don't let this have this satisfaction.

01:33:33.108 --> 01:33:34.401
Come on.

01:34:03.221 --> 01:34:06.182
PLEA AGREEMENT

01:34:17.819 --> 01:34:18.921
Scissors.

01:34:18.945 --> 01:34:20.238
Here sir.

01:34:21.198 --> 01:34:25.160
What are you looking at me for?
You are gonna be here when I'm 82.

01:34:34.878 --> 01:34:36.963
- You are beautiful.
- Thanks Gotti.

01:34:37.130 --> 01:34:39.591
You ever met my wife much?

01:34:41.551 --> 01:34:43.344
Why you fighting so hard?

01:34:43.345 --> 01:34:46.264
If you keep this, they are just
gonna send you back to solitary.

01:34:46.556 --> 01:34:48.766
Every day I am alive

01:34:48.767 --> 01:34:51.435
is to fuck your government.

01:34:51.436 --> 01:34:52.729
You understand?

01:34:55.524 --> 01:34:58.485
My son Peter was at my bed
side till the very end.

01:34:58.777 --> 01:35:00.987
I didn't want Vicky or
girls to see me like that.

01:35:01.446 --> 01:35:04.782
I made Vicky promise
and she respected my wishes.

01:35:04.783 --> 01:35:06.409
He is in a lot of pain.

01:35:07.994 --> 01:35:09.954
I know that Morphine's no longer working.

01:35:09.955 --> 01:35:12.123
Now, we can give him Ativan.

01:35:12.124 --> 01:35:14.208
It will induce a coma.

01:35:14.209 --> 01:35:16.961
He will be alive, but
he won't feel the pain.

01:35:23.135 --> 01:35:24.719
Think about this, Peter.

01:35:25.053 --> 01:35:26.513
It's your call.

01:35:33.395 --> 01:35:35.355
You keep your head up...

01:35:36.022 --> 01:35:37.732
and be strong.

01:35:39.359 --> 01:35:40.652
Okay?

01:35:41.278 --> 01:35:42.945
Promise me.

01:35:42.946 --> 01:35:44.239
I promise.

01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:46.574
Alright.

01:35:50.662 --> 01:35:53.164
Hey yo J! Check it out!

01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:06.760
One of the high profile
mobsters of recent times,

01:36:06.761 --> 01:36:10.264
John Gotti, died today
in a prison hospital in Missouri,

01:36:10.265 --> 01:36:12.349
after a battle with throat cancer.

01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:14.768
Gotti was known as "The
Teflon Don"

01:36:14.769 --> 01:36:17.855
or "the deper don,
nickname due to his taste"

01:36:17.856 --> 01:36:21.400
for wearing fancy double breasted suits.

01:36:21.401 --> 01:36:23.694
Gotti was acquitted
a number of times

01:36:23.695 --> 01:36:27.364
prior to being sentenced to
5 consecutive life terms

01:36:27.365 --> 01:36:28.782
in 1992.

01:36:28.783 --> 01:36:30.785
John Gotti dead today

01:36:30.911 --> 01:36:32.537
at age 61.

01:37:01.399 --> 01:37:03.859
Everybody here knows
that he was a great man.

01:37:03.860 --> 01:37:06.839
Look he might have been in jail, but you
know something, nobody is the saint.

01:37:06.863 --> 01:37:09.365
He didn't go around killing civilians,

01:37:09.574 --> 01:37:11.993
normal people of the street
or anything like that.

01:37:12.035 --> 01:37:13.744
He killed his own kind.

01:37:13.745 --> 01:37:15.747
"John Gotti forever"

01:37:23.547 --> 01:37:26.340
When he went to prison,
the crime rate

01:37:26.341 --> 01:37:28.319
started going up.
The street wants to taken over.

01:37:28.343 --> 01:37:31.805
It was a lot cleaner neighborhood
when Mr Gotti was around.

01:37:48.613 --> 01:37:52.367
"John Gotti will live forever"

01:38:04.129 --> 01:38:07.298
How could you be so naive?
Once they get you in,

01:38:07.299 --> 01:38:08.757
you will never be free again.

01:38:08.758 --> 01:38:12.220
They say you win this time but next time
they will make sure that you're gone.

01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:25.608
This is bullshit!

01:38:25.609 --> 01:38:27.821
A hundred more fucking years?
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:38:27.845 --> 01:38:28.546
John! Calm Down!

01:38:28.570 --> 01:38:30.989
No! My father told me they
would never let me go!

01:38:31.031 --> 01:38:34.742
He told me that. They wanna
fight the legacy of John Gotti?

01:38:34.909 --> 01:38:37.370
Well, let them fight John Gotti!

01:38:41.249 --> 01:38:42.499
We would like to believe

01:38:42.542 --> 01:38:46.671
that a trial in its purest form
is a search for the truth.

01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:50.674
But search for the truth requires
willingness to see the truth.

01:38:50.675 --> 01:38:54.928
Yesterday, the prosecutor
spoke to you about what he perceived to be,

01:38:54.929 --> 01:38:56.723
the courage of his witnesses.

01:38:56.890 --> 01:39:00.017
Well the truth is,
speaking up behind someone

01:39:00.018 --> 01:39:03.396
and shooting them in the
head is not an act of courage.

01:39:03.563 --> 01:39:07.316
It's an act of deception,
it's a display of treachery,

01:39:07.317 --> 01:39:10.986
and it's a demonstration of
a cold blooded willingness

01:39:10.987 --> 01:39:12.739
to put their own interests

01:39:12.822 --> 01:39:14.615
above that of anyone else,

01:39:14.616 --> 01:39:16.700
regardless of the consequences.

01:39:16.701 --> 01:39:19.912
Contrast that with the
courage required of John,

01:39:19.913 --> 01:39:22.540
who admittedly was in that life,

01:39:23.249 --> 01:39:26.461
but who paid for his
crimes with many years in prison.

01:39:26.836 --> 01:39:29.797
But John had the courage
to walk away from that life.

01:39:29.881 --> 01:39:33.426
The courage to tell
his dying father,

01:39:33.468 --> 01:39:35.386
to whom the life was everything,

01:39:35.512 --> 01:39:38.180
that his obligations were to his family,

01:39:38.181 --> 01:39:39.849
not to a crime family.

01:39:39.933 --> 01:39:42.852
But reality is John left the life
on his terms.

01:39:43.144 --> 01:39:46.189
Cooperation in return
for a reduced sentence?

01:39:47.107 --> 01:39:48.250
No thanks.

01:39:48.274 --> 01:39:52.195
He said, "I will do my own
time for my own crimes."

01:39:52.237 --> 01:39:54.863
In 11 years,

01:39:54.864 --> 01:39:57.908
since then the government has spent
millions of taxpayer dollars

01:39:57.909 --> 01:40:00.119
in five prosecutions.

01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:04.498
They shift John all across the country
under the most horrible conditions

01:40:04.499 --> 01:40:08.377
and what they jokingly refer
to is "diesel therapy".

01:40:08.378 --> 01:40:12.506
But in the end, they could not provide

01:40:12.507 --> 01:40:17.136
even a single credible allegation
of any contact

01:40:17.137 --> 01:40:20.098
between John and the enterprise.

01:40:21.641 --> 01:40:25.520
Once again, the government just
refuses to see the truth.

01:40:26.104 --> 01:40:28.689
When the government goes off the rails

01:40:28.690 --> 01:40:31.483
driven by ego and obsession,

01:40:31.484 --> 01:40:36.613
it's incumbent upon its citizens to
guide the government back on course.

01:40:36.614 --> 01:40:39.241
In this system, in this courtroom,

01:40:39.242 --> 01:40:42.954
you, the jury, are the
conscience of the government.

01:40:43.621 --> 01:40:46.207
It's time to do the right thing.

01:40:47.125 --> 01:40:48.835
Send him home.

01:40:49.210 --> 01:40:51.129
Send him home to his wife and his kids.

01:40:53.214 --> 01:40:56.759
Send him home to live the
life he chose to live.

01:40:57.552 --> 01:40:58.845
He's earned it.

01:41:08.062 --> 01:41:10.481
The government tried hard
to break Johnny boy,

01:41:10.482 --> 01:41:12.399
but my son took him to task.

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:14.735
5 trials in 37 months,

01:41:14.736 --> 01:41:17.113
and the government
walked away with nothing.

01:41:41.179 --> 01:41:44.014
Listen to me. And listen to me.

01:41:44.015 --> 01:41:46.517
You are never gonna see
another guy like me

01:41:46.518 --> 01:41:48.895
if you live to be 5 thousand.
