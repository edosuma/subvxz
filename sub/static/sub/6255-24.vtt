Previously on
<i>Bones...</i>

00:02.441 --> 00:04.083
She thinks there's another
serial killer out there.

00:04.083 --> 00:05.936
Because that's what Pelant
told her before he died.

00:05.961 --> 00:07.145
<i>I believe</i>

00:07.146 --> 00:09.044
<i>she was a victim</i>
<i>of the Ghost Killer.</i>

00:09.045 --> 00:12.248
I heard that they're staffing
a new field office in Germany.

00:12.282 --> 00:14.383
That's more than
a regular promotion, Booth.

00:14.417 --> 00:16.018
That sounds like a big honor.

00:16.052 --> 00:18.012
<i>Trent McNamara was</i>
<i>a nasty piece of work,</i>

00:18.021 --> 00:20.189
<i>and that's his sister</i>
<i>Stephanie.</i>

00:20.223 --> 00:22.925
We have evidence your father
paid off the medical examiner

00:22.959 --> 00:25.594
- to cover up a murder.
<i>- Stephanie McNamara</i>

00:25.629 --> 00:27.029
was the Ghost Killer.

00:27.063 --> 00:29.365
<i>The M.E. who signed off</i>
<i>on this victim</i>

00:29.399 --> 00:32.668
<i>of the Ghost Killer,</i>
<i>her autopsy, it's the same one.</i>

00:32.702 --> 00:34.303
The one Giles McNamara paid off.

00:34.337 --> 00:35.838
So, um,
Stark's finally recommended me

00:35.872 --> 00:37.539
for that promotion.
Of course,

00:37.574 --> 00:39.942
I have to be confirmed
by the House Subcommittee.

00:39.976 --> 00:41.744
Congratulations, Booth.

00:41.778 --> 00:43.812
Those are
the crime scene photos.

00:43.847 --> 00:45.214
I thought these never existed.

00:45.248 --> 00:47.216
Someone was trying to bury them
for McNamara.

00:47.250 --> 00:49.985
McNamara must have
someone working on the inside.

00:50.020 --> 00:51.954
How did the Deputy Director
react when you told him

00:51.988 --> 00:55.124
that there might be someone at
the FBI who protected McNamara?

00:55.158 --> 00:56.692
He gave me a blank check.
Told me to find out who was

00:56.726 --> 01:00.362
behind it.
Whoever it is let nine people die.

01:01.731 --> 01:03.766
Make him first...
There.

01:03.800 --> 01:07.970
Radiology...!
One, two, three, four.

01:08.004 --> 01:09.972
Nurse! Multiple gunshot wounds.
Pressure 85/40

01:10.006 --> 01:11.874
and falling.
Right lung collapsed.

01:11.908 --> 01:14.109
Find Dr. Hinshaw, tell him
to get to O.R. 2 stat.

01:14.144 --> 01:15.477
Get me a pneumothorax kit.

01:15.512 --> 01:16.545
And a lot more blood.

01:16.579 --> 01:17.546
Stay with us, Agent Booth.

01:17.580 --> 01:18.647
Stay with us.

01:18.682 --> 01:20.950
Take him to ICU, Cart 2.

01:20.984 --> 01:23.419
We're doing an infusion now.
Put him on a beta-blocker, 4, now!

01:23.453 --> 01:25.754
Seeley Booth. A shooting victim.

01:25.789 --> 01:26.781
Where is he?

01:26.806 --> 01:28.123
I don't have a name yet,
but if he just came in,

01:28.124 --> 01:28.962
they've taken him to the O.R.

01:28.987 --> 01:30.192
Which way is the O.R.?
You can't go back there.

01:30.193 --> 01:32.127
No, no! He's my husband! They
wouldn't let me ride with him.

01:32.162 --> 01:33.595
Why? Usually they...
I don't know.

01:33.630 --> 01:35.698
Hey! You can't...
you can't go back there.

01:38.902 --> 01:41.537
Let's bring him
in here, guys.

01:45.041 --> 01:46.675
You can't go in there.
I-I need to go in there.

01:46.710 --> 01:48.510
I'm a doctor. I...
It doesn't matter.

01:48.545 --> 01:49.611
You need to stay in
the waiting area

01:49.646 --> 01:51.313
or I'm gonna call security.

01:51.348 --> 01:54.049
One, two, three.

02:13.269 --> 02:14.903
Mm-hmm.

02:16.740 --> 02:19.180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-- left,
right, up, uh, the other place.

02:22.979 --> 02:24.546
"Splash the Deutsch."
Okay, you know what?

02:24.581 --> 02:27.082
All I really need to know is
"where is the bathroom?"

02:27.117 --> 02:28.684
You're going to need to know
more than that if you're going

02:28.718 --> 02:30.386
to run the Berlin field office.
Look...

02:30.420 --> 02:32.621
this is not a done deal.
I still have to go in front

02:32.655 --> 02:34.523
of the congressional panel.
Sounds like

02:34.557 --> 02:36.191
you don't want the job.
No. Look,

02:36.226 --> 02:38.293
we got a great life here.
I mean, look how beautiful

02:38.328 --> 02:40.596
this home is, all right?
Except for the German lessons.

02:40.630 --> 02:42.164
Booth.

02:42.198 --> 02:43.665
You don't know me, Agent Booth,

02:43.700 --> 02:46.035
but I need to meet you
as soon as possible.

02:46.069 --> 02:48.871
Alone.
Okay.

02:48.905 --> 02:51.874
Look, this is a secure line.
How'd you get this number?

02:51.908 --> 02:54.943
It's about the McNamaras.
And the FBI.

02:54.978 --> 02:58.847
Right. Saticoy and Maple. 3:00.

02:58.882 --> 03:01.350
What was that all about?
The McNamaras.

03:01.384 --> 03:03.652
The Ghost Killer?
No, we solved the Ghost Killer.

03:03.686 --> 03:05.988
Something about, uh,
an FBI connection.

03:06.022 --> 03:07.356
The guy wants to meet.

03:07.390 --> 03:09.525
Who is it?
I don't know.

03:09.559 --> 03:11.627
Nobody but work has that number.

03:11.661 --> 03:13.228
Well, you know what,
I still have time to trace it

03:13.263 --> 03:15.230
when I get into the office.
It'll be fine.

03:15.265 --> 03:16.598
Are you concerned?

03:16.633 --> 03:18.967
Hey. No.
Why would I be concerned, huh?

03:19.002 --> 03:20.269
If I get anything, I'll...

03:20.303 --> 03:21.870
let you know and I'll
give you a call.

03:21.905 --> 03:24.473
<i>Danke schon,</i> right?
That means "thank you,"

03:24.507 --> 03:25.774
not "good-bye."

03:31.915 --> 03:33.482
<i>The Wireless Tracking Team</i>

03:33.516 --> 03:35.384
used Orion to track
the call you got.

03:35.418 --> 03:36.353
Who is it?

03:36.378 --> 03:38.320
It's a burner, so, no name,
but they got a location.

03:38.321 --> 03:39.674
I'll head over there.

03:39.699 --> 03:41.190
Uh, you won't be the first
on the scene, Booth.

03:41.191 --> 03:43.292
'cause the fire department's already there.
What?

03:43.326 --> 03:46.195
Yeah, the place burned down.
They found a body inside.

03:46.229 --> 03:48.764
So we're too late.

03:55.472 --> 03:57.239
Looks like he was smoking,
fell asleep,

03:57.273 --> 03:59.475
set himself on fire.
What, you're calling it an accident?

03:59.509 --> 04:02.444
I'm not calling it anything yet,
but the fire department is.

04:02.479 --> 04:03.846
Unless you
overrule them.

04:04.781 --> 04:07.783
Oh, wow.

04:07.817 --> 04:09.751
Oh... that's our victim?

04:09.786 --> 04:12.888
Yeah, well,
what's left of him.

04:12.922 --> 04:15.057
He exploded.

04:15.091 --> 04:17.326
I mean, I got to say, that is

04:17.360 --> 04:19.761
not a good way to lose weight.
All right, okay.

04:19.796 --> 04:22.716
Save it for Squint Nite
at the Improv, okay, bug boy?

04:22.741 --> 04:23.365
Wow, the victim

04:23.366 --> 04:25.567
is actually fused to the vinyl.
We're gonna have

04:25.602 --> 04:27.302
to bring all this
back to the lab.

04:27.337 --> 04:30.539
Zygomatic process
indicates Caucasian.

04:30.573 --> 04:33.518
Do you think this is the man
who wanted to meet you?

04:33.685 --> 04:36.410
Well, you know, it makes sense, right?
The call came from here.

04:36.613 --> 04:38.213
Looks like he was into body art.

04:38.248 --> 04:41.250
This is part of a tattoo.

04:41.284 --> 04:43.519
Hey.

04:43.553 --> 04:45.521
Look at this.

04:45.555 --> 04:47.055
This looks like bone.

04:47.090 --> 04:48.857
Part of the victim's
sternum.

04:48.892 --> 04:50.759
Well, that would confirm that
the blast originated

04:50.793 --> 04:53.295
in his stomach.
All right, well, I found no nitrates,

04:53.329 --> 04:55.197
so I don't know
what set him off.

04:55.231 --> 04:57.833
We have to scrape off
all of the tissue

04:57.867 --> 04:59.868
and the bones from the inside
of the trailer.

04:59.903 --> 05:01.703
Hmm.

05:01.738 --> 05:03.805
Mmm. Looks like our
friend was a drinker.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.107
Wait a second.

05:05.141 --> 05:07.509
Can you drink enough,
uh, booze to explode?

05:07.544 --> 05:10.512
I actually did the math
on that one in college.

05:10.547 --> 05:13.115
So it all depends on the proof
of the liquor, right?

05:13.149 --> 05:15.050
Well, a trailer burns
at about 700 degrees,

05:15.084 --> 05:17.553
so I'd say about a quart
and a half of this stuff

05:17.587 --> 05:19.054
should do the trick.

05:19.088 --> 05:21.223
Wait a second...

05:21.257 --> 05:22.758
Take a look at this, huh?

05:22.792 --> 05:24.493
The circuit
breakers

05:24.527 --> 05:26.828
melted in the off position.
I find it very hard

05:26.863 --> 05:28.163
to believe that this guy
was just sitting

05:28.198 --> 05:29.765
in the dark waiting to explode.

05:29.799 --> 05:31.466
No one cuts the power
to their own home.

05:31.501 --> 05:32.582
If this was the man

05:32.602 --> 05:34.336
who you were supposed to meet,

05:34.370 --> 05:38.273
someone wanted to make sure
that he wouldn't talk.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.181
Since the explosion
originated in the stomach,

06:23.216 --> 06:26.084
it clearly followed the path
of least resistance.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.053
I agree. Up the esophagus,

06:28.087 --> 06:30.422
into the upper palate
and sinuses.

06:30.456 --> 06:31.790
Our first task

06:31.824 --> 06:34.726
is to separate
the heat fractures

06:34.761 --> 06:36.561
from any other
fractures

06:36.596 --> 06:38.864
that could indicate any

of the pubic symphysis

06:40.833 --> 06:42.701
indicates the victim was

06:42.735 --> 06:45.037
mid-30s.
Oh, that's consistent

06:45.071 --> 06:48.940
with the DMV records
for the trailer's owner.

06:48.975 --> 06:51.176
Wesley Foster.
That doesn't mean

06:51.210 --> 06:53.645
this is Foster.
Can you compare the

06:53.679 --> 06:55.914
photographs you just took
with his DMV picture?

06:55.948 --> 06:57.282
Yeah, I'm already

06:57.316 --> 06:59.718
on it.

07:03.756 --> 07:05.457
The dimensions
of the orbital sockets,

07:05.491 --> 07:08.326
zygomatic process,
mandible and maxilla

07:08.361 --> 07:09.861
all line up.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.129
This is Foster.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.497
Okay, I'll head back
to my office and see

07:12.532 --> 07:14.199
if I can get any
other info on him.

07:14.233 --> 07:16.635
This lung tissue is
still viable.

07:16.669 --> 07:18.203
It should help us
with cause of death.

07:18.237 --> 07:20.005
Oh, man,
it is gonna take hours

07:20.039 --> 07:22.507
to scrape the rest of him off
the inside of the trailer.

07:22.542 --> 07:23.909
I got a whopper there.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.111
That should be good
for a tox screen.

07:26.145 --> 07:28.880
Minimal particulates
within the primary bronchi.

07:28.915 --> 07:31.616
The victim didn't die
from smoke inhalation.

07:31.651 --> 07:35.120
So he was dead
before the fire started.

07:35.154 --> 07:38.490
Whoever killed him must've known
what he was gonna tell Booth.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.628
Foster was a journalist
for the <i>Chronicle.</i>

07:43.663 --> 07:45.397
His career fell apart
about five years ago.

07:45.431 --> 07:48.266
His wife left him,
he lost everything.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.069
He's been writing
this conspiracy blog ever since.

07:51.104 --> 07:52.838
It's real paranoid stuff.
Anything in there

07:52.872 --> 07:54.473
about the McNamaras?
I mean, there's thousands

07:54.507 --> 07:56.267
of posts in there,
but, yeah, there are a lot

07:56.275 --> 07:58.343
about the McNamaras, about
how corrupt the government is,

07:58.377 --> 07:59.978
you know, stuff like that.

08:00.012 --> 08:02.347
The FBI, too?
Oh, yeah. Foster was clearly unstable.

08:02.381 --> 08:04.449
Only a handful of people
even looked at the blog.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.285
If he was just unstable,
he'd still be alive.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.454
Okay, until we know everything,
I don't want anyone here

08:09.489 --> 08:12.524
knowing that we're
looking into Foster, okay?

08:12.558 --> 08:14.025
Are you with me?

08:14.060 --> 08:16.261
Sure.

08:16.295 --> 08:18.930
Ms. Julian says the McNamara
case is resurfacing, Booth.

08:18.965 --> 08:21.600
I told him you had it
all well in hand, <i>cher.</i>

08:21.634 --> 08:23.502
Yes, and I do.

08:23.536 --> 08:25.070
Everything we know so far
indicates that we are dealing

08:25.104 --> 08:26.171
with a harmless crank.

08:26.205 --> 08:28.640
A dead harmless crank.

08:28.674 --> 08:31.409
You're going to be testifying
in front of Congress, Booth.

08:31.444 --> 08:32.844
You don't want
the McNamara case

08:32.879 --> 08:35.147
hanging over you.
Or you, sir.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.115
I can
handle this.

08:37.150 --> 08:40.485
If you need any help,
I can assign additional agents.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.719
It's just routine.

08:41.720 --> 08:42.772
Then I'll see you at lunch.

08:42.797 --> 08:44.136
Right.
Lunch, sir.

08:46.392 --> 08:48.260
You're not even gonna tell
the Deputy Director?

08:48.294 --> 08:52.297
Look, if we are dealing with
a conspiracy inside the FBI,

08:52.331 --> 08:55.934
I don't want anyone
to know about this yet.

08:55.968 --> 08:57.903
Not even Stark.

09:04.076 --> 09:06.044
I just can't believe
that this much ugliness

09:06.078 --> 09:08.647
exists in the world.
You're just realizing that now?

09:08.681 --> 09:10.348
No, I always
expect the worst,

09:10.383 --> 09:12.017
but my new therapist,
she showed me

09:12.051 --> 09:14.152
how wonderful life could be.

09:14.187 --> 09:16.188
Which makes this even more horrible.
Come on now.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.822
It's affecting
your blow-drying. So let's go.

09:17.857 --> 09:19.658
Six inches from the surface
of the bone there, Fisher.

09:19.692 --> 09:21.993
Orbital pattern.
I was hoping all of the bones

09:22.028 --> 09:24.663
would be clean by now, Mr. Fisher.
Me, too.

09:24.697 --> 09:27.098
We tried to separate the
bone from the vinyl using

09:27.133 --> 09:29.067
hydrogen peroxide
and sodium carbonate,

09:29.101 --> 09:30.835
but it was too corrosive.

09:30.870 --> 09:34.139
So a hair dryer set to medium
did the trick.

09:34.173 --> 09:35.473
Oh.

09:35.508 --> 09:37.242
Uh, hold on. Okay.

09:37.276 --> 09:38.243
Huh.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.245
Here.
Thank you.

09:43.416 --> 09:47.586
Look at the central and lateral
incisors, Mr. Fisher.

09:47.620 --> 09:48.987
They're chipped.

09:49.021 --> 09:52.524
The surface is unabraded.

09:52.558 --> 09:54.726
It appears
to be recent and perimortem.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.761
He probably got into
a fight with his killer.

09:56.796 --> 09:58.530
No.

09:58.564 --> 10:01.366
The carpals are intact.

10:01.400 --> 10:06.037
The humerus, ulna and radius
bilaterally show

10:06.072 --> 10:08.807
- no signs of defensive wounds.
- I'd posit

10:08.841 --> 10:10.809
that the chipped teeth
suggest

10:10.843 --> 10:15.447
that a tube or funnel was forced
down the victim's throat.

10:15.481 --> 10:17.782
To fill him up with alcohol.

10:17.817 --> 10:20.118
Bastard.
I beg your pardon?

10:20.152 --> 10:21.286
Fisher's just
starting to realize

10:21.320 --> 10:23.021
that murderers are bad.

10:24.757 --> 10:26.458
What are you doing?
If the killer's hands

10:26.492 --> 10:28.260
were inside his mouth,

10:28.294 --> 10:31.429
we could get some of the son
of a bitch's epithelial cells

10:31.464 --> 10:34.332
from on or
in-between his teeth.

10:36.035 --> 10:39.304
The hard drive was removed
from Foster's computer.

10:39.338 --> 10:41.473
If they stole his hard drive,
he wasn't a crank.

10:41.507 --> 10:43.074
"They."
Yeah, "they."

10:43.109 --> 10:44.576
The guy was looking
into some kind of conspiracy.

10:44.610 --> 10:45.877
They can't have that happening.

10:45.911 --> 10:48.246
Who is this "they"?
"They" are the ones

10:48.281 --> 10:50.849
that poison our environment.
"They" are the ones

10:50.883 --> 10:52.751
who start wars to protect
corporate profits.

10:52.785 --> 10:55.153
"They" give themselves
raises on the backs of the voiceless...

10:55.187 --> 10:57.088
How many "they"s
are we talking about, Hodgins?

10:57.123 --> 10:59.057
'Cause it sounds like thousands.

10:59.091 --> 11:01.526
Yeah, let's just start with the
person who took his hard drive.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.662
Well, Foster would
not have left anything important on it.

11:03.696 --> 11:06.097
No way. Not if he thought he'd
uncovered a conspiracy, okay?

11:06.132 --> 11:07.532
He'd make sure

11:07.566 --> 11:09.334
every document
and every file

11:09.368 --> 11:11.603
was secure and hidden.
How could you

11:11.637 --> 11:13.204
possibly know
what this guy would do?

11:13.239 --> 11:14.873
Because it's what I would do.

11:14.907 --> 11:17.275
Check cloud-based backups,
maybe places he worked.

11:17.310 --> 11:20.312
I'll keep checking the trailer.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.980
<i>Foster must have found out that</i>

11:22.014 --> 11:23.982
you were the lead investigator
on the McNamara case.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.684
And whoever killed Foster
incinerated the place

11:25.718 --> 11:27.319
so we wouldn't
find anything.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.021
We should ask Stark for more
help on this case, Booth.

11:30.056 --> 11:31.890
Bones, it's just
another case.

11:31.924 --> 11:33.425
You know that's not true.

11:33.459 --> 11:35.760
You suspected
an FBI leak yourself,

11:35.795 --> 11:37.696
when we were investigating
the Ghost Killer.

11:37.730 --> 11:40.165
Right, and if there
is one, we'll find it.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.167
Sweets would say
that since this may be

11:42.201 --> 11:43.768
your last case
before being promoted,

11:43.803 --> 11:45.904
you need to prove
that you're still the best.

11:45.938 --> 11:47.305
And what would you say?

11:47.340 --> 11:48.907
I say you just can't stand

11:48.941 --> 11:50.108
to let someone
get away with murder.

11:50.142 --> 11:51.910
Booth.

11:51.944 --> 11:55.880
I got Foster's employment
records and found his last job.

11:55.915 --> 11:58.516
He was a night janitor
at Crius Security.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.852
It's a holding company
owned by the McNamara family.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.687
You got to be kidding me.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.690
Foster was a night janitor at
one of McNamara's companies.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.593
That means he would be alone
there with access to computers, files...

12:08.627 --> 12:11.629
Everything. We need
to find out what he saw there.

12:16.225 --> 12:18.293
I have no idea
who this man Foster is.

12:18.327 --> 12:21.029
All janitorial services
at Crius are supplied

12:21.063 --> 12:23.498
by an independent contractor.
Right, but if he was alone

12:23.532 --> 12:26.301
at night, he would have access
to your computers

12:26.335 --> 12:28.236
and your offices, correct?

12:28.270 --> 12:30.972
Crius is a security services
company, Agent Booth.

12:31.006 --> 12:33.708
I can assure you no one can
break into our computers.

12:33.743 --> 12:35.310
But if he did
find a way

12:35.344 --> 12:38.513
into your system
or perhaps a safe...

12:38.547 --> 12:40.515
- Ah, he couldn't.
- Right, so, you provide

12:40.549 --> 12:43.051
consultants to the FBI and
the State Department, correct?

12:43.085 --> 12:45.153
We have, yes.
I'm gonna need a list

12:45.187 --> 12:48.156
of who you deal with
and what those services were.

12:48.190 --> 12:50.992
I'm sorry. I can't.

12:51.026 --> 12:52.427
A man was murdered,
Ms. Sprung.

12:52.461 --> 12:53.795
I understand.

12:53.829 --> 12:55.263
But unfortunately,

12:55.297 --> 12:58.066
our operations are bigger
than any one man.

12:58.100 --> 13:00.635
So, if you found that someone
did compromise your system,

13:00.669 --> 13:02.837
they'd be expendable.

13:02.872 --> 13:05.807
I think we're done, Agent Booth.

13:05.841 --> 13:10.512
For now, yes, until I get
a warrant to search your office.

13:17.486 --> 13:20.188
This is a piece
of his right ventricle.

13:20.222 --> 13:21.689
It's damaged.

13:21.724 --> 13:24.459
He had a heart attack,
probably a year or so ago.

13:24.493 --> 13:26.594
Well, no surprise.
I mean, he drank, smoked...

13:26.629 --> 13:28.496
Hey, if I can separate
out some particulates,

13:28.531 --> 13:31.633
I might be able to find some
that were left by the killer.

13:31.667 --> 13:33.635
Charred bone can look
like wood splinters,

13:33.669 --> 13:35.003
or even metal fragments.

13:35.037 --> 13:36.604
Until we find
all the missing pieces,

13:36.639 --> 13:38.540
we're not gonna get
an accurate picture of what

13:38.574 --> 13:40.308
happened to him.

13:40.342 --> 13:42.177
Oh, man, there are pieces
of this guy everywhere.

13:42.211 --> 13:44.045
Fragments of the sternum
and a rib.

13:44.079 --> 13:46.114
I got something
for you here, too.

13:46.148 --> 13:47.549
Part of the parietal.

13:47.583 --> 13:50.318
Cam?

13:50.352 --> 13:52.453
What the hell is this?

13:52.488 --> 13:54.189
It's a nipple.

13:54.223 --> 13:55.924
No, I know

13:55.958 --> 13:58.927
a nipple when I see one, but
there's something fused into it.

13:58.961 --> 14:00.728
Oh, it... it's a nipple ring.

14:00.763 --> 14:02.497
Wait a minute.

14:02.531 --> 14:03.798
That is high-grade
stainless steel.

14:03.833 --> 14:06.267
That is not common
for piercings.

14:12.708 --> 14:14.275
I think you were right.

14:14.310 --> 14:16.878
Foster didn't keep important
things on his computer.

14:16.912 --> 14:18.112
He kept them here.

14:18.147 --> 14:19.614
That is a memory chip.

14:19.648 --> 14:21.349
Whoa. I am totally on board

14:21.383 --> 14:23.952
for this conspiracy. Bastards.

14:23.986 --> 14:26.287
Yes, they are.

14:28.190 --> 14:31.693
So everything
from Crius is classified.

14:31.727 --> 14:33.294
Yeah, that's what
they tell me.

14:33.329 --> 14:35.129
You have military and civilian
SCI security clearance.

14:35.164 --> 14:37.445
Right, yeah, and they're still
not gonna tell me anything.

14:37.466 --> 14:39.500
So what does
that tell you?

14:39.535 --> 14:42.370
It tells me that no matter what
they're hiding, it's a murder,

14:42.404 --> 14:44.806
so Caroline can get us a warrant
for their records.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.241
Apparently
not, <i>cher.</i>

14:46.275 --> 14:48.276
I've been to
three judges.

14:48.310 --> 14:49.944
All of them denied
the request.

14:49.979 --> 14:53.481
On what grounds?
The old classic. National security.

14:53.515 --> 14:55.216
- You're kidding me. National security?
- But it's a special circumstance

14:55.251 --> 14:56.651
because murder's involved,
and Booth has clearance.

14:56.685 --> 14:58.219
They said murder
hasn't been proven.

14:58.254 --> 14:59.754
Proven?
The Jeffersonian

14:59.788 --> 15:02.290
has more than enough evidence
to get a warrant.

15:02.324 --> 15:04.058
Did you show 'em the files?

15:04.093 --> 15:06.294
Don't shoot the messenger, <i>cher.</i>
I tried everything.

15:06.328 --> 15:07.962
But each judge
booted little old me

15:07.997 --> 15:09.898
out of their chambers
within five minutes.

15:09.932 --> 15:11.466
Who controls three different judges?

15:11.500 --> 15:13.434
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

15:13.469 --> 15:15.069
What is it?

15:15.104 --> 15:16.771
I got lunch with Stark

15:16.805 --> 15:18.740
and Congressman Hadley
from the subcommittee.

15:18.774 --> 15:21.109
You still going
to keep all this from him?

15:21.143 --> 15:22.744
Wouldn't you?

15:29.184 --> 15:31.519
Well, there's
perimortem fractures

15:31.553 --> 15:33.688
on the eighth and ninth ribs
and to the sternum.

15:33.722 --> 15:34.923
No remodeling.

15:34.957 --> 15:37.558
So it happened
just before he died.

15:37.593 --> 15:39.360
I've seen
similar fracture patterns

15:39.395 --> 15:41.863
caused by aggressive CPR.

15:41.897 --> 15:44.265
Why would a killer try and
revive someone they wanted dead?

15:44.300 --> 15:46.067
Quite simple:
Torture.

15:46.101 --> 15:47.802
They wanted information, but
they accidentally killed him.

15:47.836 --> 15:50.204
And if it's still
on that nipple ring,

15:50.239 --> 15:51.906
he clearly didn't
give it to 'em.

15:55.978 --> 15:59.180
It's really just a pro forma
hearing, Agent Booth.

15:59.214 --> 16:02.016
You have the support of the
bureau, myself, my party,

16:02.051 --> 16:04.285
and your record is exemplary.

16:04.320 --> 16:05.787
Thank you, Congressman.
It was difficult

16:05.821 --> 16:07.422
to pry Booth out of the field.

16:07.456 --> 16:09.157
Which is why he is the nominee.

16:09.191 --> 16:11.893
I can't tell you the number
of positions that are filled

16:11.927 --> 16:13.861
by bureaucrats who have no real
experience on the ground.

16:13.896 --> 16:15.496
Oh, the military

16:15.531 --> 16:17.598
taught me that you can't make
the right decision

16:17.633 --> 16:18.967
without seeing
the situation up close.

16:19.001 --> 16:20.601
Thank you.
I am surprised

16:20.636 --> 16:22.971
that you're letting
this one get away, Victor.

16:23.005 --> 16:24.539
It's not easy.

16:24.573 --> 16:26.708
Of course the opposition's
gonna try and put you

16:26.742 --> 16:28.843
through the ringer, but don't
you worry-- it's just a show.

16:28.877 --> 16:30.645
I have your records. I'll...

16:30.679 --> 16:32.947
I'm sorry, sir,
but I have to take this call.

16:32.982 --> 16:34.449
Can't it wait, Booth?
It can't, sir.

16:34.483 --> 16:35.883
I'm right in the
middle of a...

16:35.918 --> 16:37.078
It's okay. It's okay. Just...

16:37.086 --> 16:38.519
No explanations necessary.

16:38.554 --> 16:40.188
He has work
to do, Victor.

16:40.222 --> 16:42.757
But, uh, tomorrow,
put it on vibrate.

16:42.791 --> 16:44.058
Yes, sir.

16:45.127 --> 16:47.395
Booth.

16:47.429 --> 16:49.063
What do we have?

16:49.098 --> 16:50.531
The fire compromised the chip,

16:50.566 --> 16:52.467
but there's still a lot
that I can recover.

16:52.501 --> 16:53.835
This is just the start.

16:53.869 --> 16:55.336
There are confidential
bank records,

16:55.371 --> 16:56.838
transcripts from
private meetings.

16:56.872 --> 16:58.339
Wait a second.
Between who?

16:58.374 --> 16:59.841
People in government,

16:59.875 --> 17:03.144
business, political activists,
foreign officials.

17:03.178 --> 17:04.746
There are also hacked e-mails.

17:04.780 --> 17:06.814
Foster must have gotten
all this from Crius.

17:06.848 --> 17:09.083
- What about the photographs?
- There are some public figures,

17:09.117 --> 17:10.685
and then there's some people
I've never seen.

17:10.719 --> 17:11.853
I'll do a search using

17:11.887 --> 17:13.054
facial recognition
software.

17:14.556 --> 17:15.790
These all seem to be
surveillance photos, Booth.

17:15.824 --> 17:18.792
Stop it.
What is it?

17:18.827 --> 17:20.627
That one.

17:23.298 --> 17:25.733
I took it.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.617
Wouldn't we be better off at your office?
Look at all the stuff

17:33.652 --> 17:36.366
that Angela's uncovered-- I
mean, Foster, he wasn't a crank.

17:36.367 --> 17:38.268
The FBI's the last place
we want to be.

17:38.303 --> 17:39.937
Got to admit, all of this stuff
can be used to blackmail people.

17:39.971 --> 17:41.705
Not blackmail for cash.

17:41.739 --> 17:43.740
All right? Just getting people
to do what you want them to do.

17:43.775 --> 17:45.609
And that's worth
a lot more than money.

17:45.643 --> 17:47.611
Angela said
she's sending you more,

17:47.645 --> 17:49.813
but a lot of the files
are either encrypted

17:49.848 --> 17:51.488
or damaged from the fire.
I can't get over

17:51.516 --> 17:53.884
all the information
she's coming up with.

17:53.918 --> 17:55.252
You realize if you don't
find out who's behind this,

17:55.286 --> 17:57.121
we could all be in deep trouble.

17:57.155 --> 17:58.689
I was told that
the photograph I took was

17:58.723 --> 18:00.591
for a routine drug stakeout,
all right?

18:00.625 --> 18:03.227
Angela I.D.'s the girl
as Senator Wilby's daughter.

18:03.261 --> 18:04.661
Wilby withdrew
from the Senate race

18:04.696 --> 18:06.797
when he was a lock to win.
This must be why.

18:06.831 --> 18:08.765
Whoever's behind this
doesn't want Wilby in office.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.434
These new files

18:10.468 --> 18:12.136
are intercepted e-mails showing

18:12.170 --> 18:13.804
financial
improprieties by

18:13.838 --> 18:15.706
business leaders,
foreign ambassadors,

18:15.740 --> 18:17.374
State Department
officials...

18:17.408 --> 18:19.368
We need to find one of them
who's willing to talk.

18:19.377 --> 18:20.878
Guys, someone running
an operation this tight,

18:20.912 --> 18:22.513
is gonna keep themselves
insulated.

18:22.547 --> 18:23.847
The victims--
they probably don't even know

18:23.882 --> 18:25.849
who was blackmailing them.

18:25.884 --> 18:29.286
Okay, I thought these were heat
fractures, but check this out.

18:29.320 --> 18:31.855
No shrinkage or distortion
typical of heat fractures.

18:31.890 --> 18:34.858
These are spiral fractures.

18:34.893 --> 18:36.293
His upper limbs were twisted.

18:36.327 --> 18:38.428
Further evidence of torture.

18:38.463 --> 18:39.863
So, why wouldn't Foster
try and fight back?

18:39.898 --> 18:41.298
Because there were
three of them.

18:41.332 --> 18:42.966
Three assailants?

18:43.001 --> 18:44.501
I got viable epithelial cells

18:44.536 --> 18:47.004
from the victim's teeth.
All three are male.

18:47.038 --> 18:48.532
Two Caucasian and one
of African descent.

18:48.557 --> 18:49.606
I.D.'s?

18:49.607 --> 18:52.409
I ran them through CODIS
and NDIS-- no matches.

18:52.443 --> 18:53.844
So, all of the new stuff

18:53.878 --> 18:55.746
that Angela's sending
is about McNamara.

18:55.780 --> 18:57.447
This is the mother lode.

18:57.482 --> 18:58.749
But I don't understand why
McNamara is in here

18:58.783 --> 19:01.018
if he was involved
in the blackmailing.

19:01.052 --> 19:02.543
Because he wasn't.

19:02.568 --> 19:05.055
There are memos and letters and
documents showing questionable

19:05.056 --> 19:07.824
business dealings McNamara had.
Bribes to foreign countries.

19:07.859 --> 19:10.827
Even McNamara couldn't avoid
jail time if that got out.

19:10.862 --> 19:12.529
'Cause he was being
blackmailed, too.

19:12.564 --> 19:13.997
That's why they were able to use
McNamara's security firm.

19:14.032 --> 19:15.399
That's why
someone was able

19:15.433 --> 19:17.067
to block
the warrant to investigate it?

19:17.101 --> 19:18.302
So let me get
this straight:

19:18.336 --> 19:20.704
We're looking at someone
inside the FBI

19:20.738 --> 19:23.707
who can control
businessmen, politicians,

19:23.741 --> 19:25.809
foreign officials.
Yeah, and it must have been going on

19:25.843 --> 19:28.145
for a long time 'cause these
pictures are about 20 years old.

19:28.179 --> 19:29.913
We have enough here, Booth.

19:29.948 --> 19:32.749
And the surveillance photos
link us back to the FBI, so...

19:32.784 --> 19:34.518
What do you suggest
that we do, huh?

19:34.552 --> 19:37.454
Storm the FBI?
We don't know who's behind this.

19:37.488 --> 19:39.194
We could go public
with what we've found.

19:39.219 --> 19:40.090
Public? No, no, no, no, no.

19:40.091 --> 19:41.892
We're not gonna go public
with any of this.

19:41.926 --> 19:43.327
A lot of people--
they just got caught

19:43.361 --> 19:44.928
with their pants down,
all right?

19:44.963 --> 19:46.764
They don't deserve
to have their lives ruined.

19:46.798 --> 19:48.098
We have to do something, <i>cher.</i>

19:48.132 --> 19:50.133
This is what
we're gonna do, okay?

19:50.168 --> 19:52.069
We're gonna act like we've never
seen any of this stuff before

19:52.103 --> 19:53.904
until we know
who's behind this operation.

19:53.938 --> 19:55.539
<i>There are no ligature marks,</i>

19:55.573 --> 19:57.674
which means that two of the men
held him down

19:57.709 --> 19:59.309
while the third
assailant--

19:59.344 --> 20:00.844
I'm sorry--

20:00.878 --> 20:02.179
the third bastard tortured him.

20:02.213 --> 20:04.448
Thank you.
I have not been able to find

20:04.482 --> 20:06.617
any particulates that identify
who these guys are.

20:06.651 --> 20:09.319
This fracture on
the C3 feels odd.

20:12.957 --> 20:14.992
This is definitely
anomalous.

20:15.026 --> 20:16.893
The only time I've seen
a fracture like this

20:16.928 --> 20:19.296
is when I was identifying
remains in Iraq.

20:19.330 --> 20:21.298
Oh, so now
the Iraqis are involved?

20:21.332 --> 20:24.835
This fracture was caused
by a take-down stranglehold.

20:24.869 --> 20:27.170
It's a maneuver used
by Delta Force operatives.

20:27.205 --> 20:31.308
Okay, so if they're Delta Force,
their DNA should be on file.

20:31.342 --> 20:33.110
Their DNA is erased
from the system.

20:33.144 --> 20:34.244
Hodgins found
no particulates.

20:34.279 --> 20:35.979
I have found no

20:36.014 --> 20:38.582
bone markers that might I.D. them.
If they are Delta Force,

20:38.616 --> 20:40.417
they're not gonna
leave a trace, okay?

20:40.451 --> 20:42.452
I've trained with these guys.
I know how they work.

20:42.487 --> 20:44.888
So you're just giving up?
How can you say that to me?

20:44.922 --> 20:46.623
I'm not gonna give up.
You told Caroline and Sweets

20:46.658 --> 20:48.625
not to do anything,
and now you're telling me

20:48.660 --> 20:51.028
that we'll never I.D. the killers.
Calm down.

20:51.062 --> 20:52.095
Calm down?! No, Booth!

20:52.130 --> 20:54.197
We need to do something!

20:54.232 --> 20:56.099
Look, I know you need
to feel in control, okay?

20:56.134 --> 20:58.402
But we're not. Not yet.
When? If they figure out

20:58.436 --> 21:01.138
that we're closing in on them,
I'm not going to sit back

21:01.172 --> 21:03.540
and wait for the worst
to happen.

21:03.574 --> 21:05.008
That's why we're gonna
let them win.

21:05.043 --> 21:06.343
That makes no sense.

21:06.377 --> 21:09.379
At least try to be rational.
I am.

21:09.414 --> 21:11.381
I want you to issue
your report on Foster's death,

21:11.416 --> 21:13.317
and say that it was an accident.

21:13.351 --> 21:15.085
But it wasn't.

21:15.119 --> 21:17.521
Y-You want me to say
that I'm wrong?

21:17.555 --> 21:18.889
I-I'm never wrong.

21:18.923 --> 21:22.659
Which is why
they're gonna believe it.

21:24.796 --> 21:26.930
That gives us... time

21:26.964 --> 21:28.498
with no eyes on us.

21:28.533 --> 21:31.902
Pretty rational, right?

21:31.936 --> 21:34.938
Look, I want to act like we put
this one to bed, all right?

21:34.972 --> 21:36.306
And we pretend
to move forward.

21:36.341 --> 21:38.175
All right?
I go to my hearing,

21:38.209 --> 21:40.644
you continue to play with your
bones, and we keep digging.

21:40.678 --> 21:44.081
And we're in control again.

21:44.115 --> 21:47.317
And we're in control again.

21:48.886 --> 21:51.321
<i>Keep your answers concise,</i>

21:51.356 --> 21:52.756
you'll be great.

21:52.790 --> 21:53.990
Don't worry, sir.
I got this one covered.

21:54.025 --> 21:55.392
Hadley prepped
the other members,

21:55.426 --> 21:57.327
so you'll have a lot
of friends in there.

21:57.362 --> 21:58.729
Sorry. Sorry I'm late.

21:58.763 --> 22:00.523
I was finishing my report
on the Foster case.

22:00.531 --> 22:01.998
I'm glad
you're here.

22:02.033 --> 22:04.067
What'd you find?
We retrieved lung tissue

22:04.102 --> 22:06.436
that indicates he died
of smoke inhalation

22:06.471 --> 22:07.838
after consuming
a large quantity

22:07.872 --> 22:09.306
of alcohol and
starting a fire

22:09.340 --> 22:11.341
with a lit cigarette.
It was an accident.

22:11.376 --> 22:12.709
I thought you suspected murder.

22:12.744 --> 22:14.611
Well, Bones here, she likes
to keep her options open.

22:14.645 --> 22:16.346
Turns out that, uh,
Foster was a drunk,

22:16.381 --> 22:18.215
harmless crank after all, sir.

22:18.249 --> 22:21.017
It's all in my report. Yeah.
Then let's head in.

22:21.052 --> 22:23.520
And thank you for being here.
For supporting your husband.

22:23.554 --> 22:26.490
It means a lot to the Bureau.
To me, too.

22:35.433 --> 22:38.502
The FBI already has
an excellent team in Berlin,

22:38.536 --> 22:40.804
so the challenge
isn't a procedural one.

22:40.838 --> 22:42.272
Please be more specific.

22:42.306 --> 22:44.474
What exactly is the challenge,
Agent Booth?

22:44.509 --> 22:46.469
We need to get a better
understanding of potential

22:46.477 --> 22:48.812
terrorists that might
target American interests.

22:48.846 --> 22:51.581
I've laid out a 15-point plan
that addresses that.

22:51.616 --> 22:53.850
Each of you got a copy
of that yesterday.

22:53.885 --> 22:55.452
Okay, then.

22:55.486 --> 22:58.889
I yield to
Congressman Hadley.

22:58.923 --> 23:00.524
Agent Booth, welcome.

23:00.558 --> 23:03.360
I have reviewed your
military and your FBI records

23:03.394 --> 23:07.030
and I must say they
are very impressive.

23:07.064 --> 23:09.366
Thank you, Congressman.
I do have

23:09.400 --> 23:11.735
one question, though. Um...

23:11.769 --> 23:13.537
what is your relationship

23:13.571 --> 23:15.705
to Daniel Johnson?

23:20.945 --> 23:23.079
With all due respect, sir,
I can't answer that question.

23:23.114 --> 23:24.448
Well, then
let me try.

23:24.482 --> 23:26.616
Daniel Johnson was a
United States citizen

23:26.651 --> 23:29.386
whom you assassinated
in Pakistan in 2002.

23:29.420 --> 23:30.787
Isn't that correct?
Congressman,

23:30.822 --> 23:32.289
there are government directives

23:32.323 --> 23:33.790
that prevent me from discussing

23:33.825 --> 23:36.326
anything to do with
operations in Pakistan.

23:36.360 --> 23:38.028
I thought you said
he was a friend.

23:38.062 --> 23:40.197
I don't understand what's happening.
Agent Booth,

23:40.231 --> 23:41.865
it-it does not require
a discussion.

23:41.899 --> 23:44.067
Did you or did you not
assassinate an American citizen?

23:44.101 --> 23:45.735
Those are classified
documents.

23:45.770 --> 23:48.171
You should not have access to them.
I'll take that

23:48.206 --> 23:49.873
as an admission of guilt.

23:49.907 --> 23:51.641
I'm not admitting guilt
to anything, sir.

23:51.676 --> 23:53.243
So, you're saying that the
law does not apply to you?

23:53.277 --> 23:55.212
That's not what I'm saying.
'Cause we are here,

23:55.246 --> 23:57.147
supposedly, to confirm you

23:57.181 --> 24:00.083
as a chief law enforcement
officer in a foreign country.

24:00.117 --> 24:01.734
Then you should understand...

24:01.759 --> 24:03.820
Well, what I do understand is
how embarrassing it would be

24:03.821 --> 24:05.121
to confirm an assassin.

24:05.156 --> 24:07.791
You're out of line, sir!
Since Agent Booth

24:07.825 --> 24:11.127
will not answer,
I have no further questions.

24:11.162 --> 24:12.629
Then this committee
is adjourned.

24:14.699 --> 24:17.067
Were you not expecting
this line of questioning?

24:19.504 --> 24:21.805
How do you expect to be
confirmed if you won't answer...

24:21.839 --> 24:23.440
Over here!
Over here, Agent Booth!

24:27.212 --> 24:29.180
Is it true you killed an American citizen?
I don't have a...

24:29.214 --> 24:31.316
Were you acting under orders or alone?
I don't have a comment.

24:31.350 --> 24:33.685
Don't you think every American
deserves a fair trial?

24:33.719 --> 24:35.086
Do you think you're above the law?
I said no comment.

24:35.120 --> 24:36.721
Are you gonna withdraw
your nomination

24:36.755 --> 24:38.723
in light of these revelations?
He said no comment.

24:38.757 --> 24:41.277
I don't have a comment.
Are you hiding behind national security?

24:41.293 --> 24:42.692
No, I am not hiding behind...

24:42.717 --> 24:44.395
Are you being sent overseas
to assassinate American targets?

24:44.396 --> 24:46.664
No! I am not! No!
Have you lied about anything else during...

24:46.699 --> 24:48.399
No, he has not lied about
anything. He is a decorated

24:48.434 --> 24:50.501
veteran who served his country with honor
Come on, let's go.

24:50.536 --> 24:52.804
and an agent at the FBI
who has one of the best

24:52.838 --> 24:53.972
conviction rates of any...
Let's get out of here.

24:54.006 --> 24:56.007
Agent Booth! Agent Booth!

24:56.041 --> 24:57.608
...assassinating
a U.S. citizen!

25:00.179 --> 25:01.913
I thought Stark said that
Hadley was on your side.

25:01.947 --> 25:03.414
Well, he was, okay?
Somebody got to him.

25:03.449 --> 25:05.450
Which means
whoever did get to him

25:05.484 --> 25:07.533
knows that you're still
looking into the FBI.

25:07.558 --> 25:08.820
Somebody must have fed

25:08.821 --> 25:12.190
classified documents to Hadley
to bring me down, okay?

25:12.224 --> 25:15.033
I wouldn't be surprised if this
whole promotion was a setup.

25:15.034 --> 25:15.690
Why?

25:15.715 --> 25:17.628
Why? Because we looked
too closely at McNamara

25:17.629 --> 25:18.997
during this whole Ghost Killer
thing, all right?

25:19.031 --> 25:20.798
We found out more
than we should've.

25:20.833 --> 25:22.633
Why just you?
Why not all of us?

25:22.668 --> 25:25.036
Because I'm a warning.
For everyone.

25:25.070 --> 25:28.539
Anthropologically, when
a society feels threatened

25:28.574 --> 25:29.841
by an individual, that society

25:29.875 --> 25:32.543
tries to eliminate
the threat.

25:32.578 --> 25:34.512
The collective fear
becomes so severe that

25:34.546 --> 25:36.614
murder becomes acceptable.
It happened

25:36.648 --> 25:38.082
in Rome, the Haps...
Bones, Bones.

25:38.117 --> 25:40.284
Just boil it down for me.

25:40.319 --> 25:42.387
They get desperate.

25:42.421 --> 25:44.722
That's always their undoing.

25:44.757 --> 25:46.824
Come on.

25:46.859 --> 25:48.579
Whoever's behind this,
if they get careless,

25:48.594 --> 25:50.061
they're vulnerable.
Well, using Hadley seems pretty...

25:50.095 --> 25:52.397
Booth! I've already
had calls from the Director,

25:52.431 --> 25:54.665
the White House Chief of Staff...
Look, I understand.

25:54.700 --> 25:56.834
- How did he get those documents?
- I don't know.

25:56.869 --> 25:58.536
Look, Booth,
I still believe in you.

25:58.570 --> 26:00.271
Whatever happened over there...
But you have to withdraw

26:00.305 --> 26:03.307
my nomination.
And put you on administrative leave.

26:03.342 --> 26:06.445
He's the best agent you have
and you're firing him?

26:06.470 --> 26:08.212
Administrative leave.

26:08.213 --> 26:10.948
He's not being fired.
Yes, I am, sir. We both know

26:10.983 --> 26:12.884
how this plays out.

26:12.918 --> 26:15.219
My hands are tied, Booth.

26:15.254 --> 26:16.487
Agent Booth!

26:16.522 --> 26:19.057
Agent Booth!

26:20.692 --> 26:22.760
Director Stark, did you
have knowledge about this?

26:22.795 --> 26:24.028
Sir, can you please...

26:32.971 --> 26:35.473
Hey. Shouldn't you be
with Booth right now?

26:35.507 --> 26:38.042
The best way to help Booth
is to solve Foster's murder.

26:38.077 --> 26:40.916
Hey, okay, so Fisher found
some trace in the C3, right?

26:40.917 --> 26:42.654
Turns out to be
a metal particulate.

26:42.655 --> 26:44.416
The alloy was
a combination of...

26:44.417 --> 26:46.727
It was a watch band issued
to Delta Force commandos.

26:46.752 --> 26:49.225
It sliced into the bone.
Maybe I could work backwards.

26:49.755 --> 26:51.422
I beg your pardon?
The government database

26:51.457 --> 26:53.124
obviously erased their DNA.

26:53.158 --> 26:55.326
But if I can get all
Delta Force personnel for,

26:55.360 --> 26:57.261
say, the last 15 years...
You can find

26:57.296 --> 26:59.897
the three who have
no DNA on file.

26:59.932 --> 27:01.799
Those'll be our killers.
Exactly.

27:01.834 --> 27:05.803
Hey... I know why Hadley
turned on Booth.

27:05.838 --> 27:09.607
I ran Hadley's name,
Social Security number,

27:09.641 --> 27:12.276
medical records...
everything I could access.

27:12.311 --> 27:14.212
Nothing usable came up.

27:14.246 --> 27:16.180
Then I ran a facial
recognition algorithm

27:16.215 --> 27:17.949
through all of
the photographs

27:17.983 --> 27:20.785
that I've recovered,
so far, from Foster's chip.

27:20.819 --> 27:23.121
Wow. That guy's

27:23.155 --> 27:26.090
definitely not Hadley's wife.
They blackmailed him, too.

27:26.125 --> 27:29.026
J. Edgar Hoover looks like an amateur
compared to whoever did this.

27:29.061 --> 27:31.829
Maybe Booth can use this
to make Hadley talk.

27:31.864 --> 27:34.499
I'll call him.
No. No phones.

27:44.109 --> 27:46.577
Bones. Everything okay?

27:46.612 --> 27:48.746
I thought you might
want some help packing up.

27:48.780 --> 27:51.816
Yeah. Sure. That's...
That's okay, right?

27:54.653 --> 27:56.554
Are you okay?
Yeah.

27:56.588 --> 27:58.656
I just, you know,
I want to pack up,

27:58.690 --> 28:00.391
get out of here
and move on.

28:01.760 --> 28:02.960
You'll be fine.

28:02.995 --> 28:05.963
This'll all work
out, you'll see.

28:05.998 --> 28:07.632
Right.

28:36.094 --> 28:37.695
What the hell are you doing?

28:37.729 --> 28:39.931
I think you know.
Look, you get out of here.

28:39.965 --> 28:42.200
I'm gonna call the cops.
No, you won't.

28:42.234 --> 28:45.036
I don't care, by the way,
but obviously you care enough

28:45.070 --> 28:47.104
to shut me down.

28:47.139 --> 28:49.407
Oh, God.

28:49.441 --> 28:51.275
Who approached you?

28:51.310 --> 28:53.611
Just let it go, Agent Booth.
Really?

28:53.645 --> 28:55.079
Is that why you became
a congressman--

28:55.113 --> 28:56.914
to let criminals
run this country?

28:58.417 --> 29:01.986
They will kill me.
Not before I shut them down first.

29:02.020 --> 29:05.122
You can't. Trust me.

29:05.157 --> 29:06.457
Trust you? Seriously?

29:06.491 --> 29:08.392
Look, I am trying
to help you.

29:08.427 --> 29:10.061
This is bigger than you can
imagine-- why don't you just

29:10.095 --> 29:12.697
go away like they want?
That's not gonna happen,

29:12.731 --> 29:13.965
Congressman, I'm sorry.

29:13.999 --> 29:15.233
All the stuff
that they're hiding--

29:15.267 --> 29:16.367
I have it all.

29:16.401 --> 29:18.369
Everything.

29:18.403 --> 29:19.937
And I'm not gonna
keep it to myself.

29:33.263 --> 29:35.565
Listen, just
take Christine and go.

29:35.599 --> 29:37.333
I'm not gonna leave you
here alone, Booth.

29:37.367 --> 29:39.235
Look, you don't
have a choice.

29:39.757 --> 29:41.591
Do you understand?

29:41.853 --> 29:43.654
Hadley took the bait, okay?

29:43.688 --> 29:46.089
He called a burner cell. They're
sending a team after me now.

29:46.124 --> 29:46.961
Angela heard the whole thing.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.753
Which means you shouldn't
stay here either.

29:48.754 --> 29:51.595
This is my fight, okay, Bones?
I know that's not what you want,

29:51.596 --> 29:53.297
but that's just the way
it played out.

29:53.331 --> 29:54.965
You know we're better together, Booth.
No. Look,

29:54.999 --> 29:56.099
I'm not gonna argue about this

29:56.134 --> 29:57.200
right now, do you understand?

29:57.235 --> 29:58.468
They're 40 minutes out, tops.

30:03.207 --> 30:05.742
What, you-you kept
C-4 in our garage?

30:05.777 --> 30:07.411
It's stable
until you detonate it.

30:07.445 --> 30:09.413
Booth...
Oh, my God, Booth!

30:09.447 --> 30:11.315
These guys are Delta Force.

30:11.349 --> 30:13.417
They know you were a Ranger,
they're gonna be ready.

30:13.451 --> 30:15.152
Yeah, well, so will I.
I-I...

30:15.186 --> 30:17.354
I-I have my gun.
I'm an excellent shot. I...

30:17.388 --> 30:20.324
No. No. This is done now,
do you understand?

30:20.358 --> 30:21.792
We have a daughter
to think about now.

30:21.826 --> 30:23.594
You get Christine
you and go to Max. Now.

30:23.628 --> 30:27.598
I'm not asking you,
I'm telling you. <i>Now.</i>

30:28.766 --> 30:31.935
I hate you for
telling me to walk away.

30:33.671 --> 30:35.305
Bones...

30:40.545 --> 30:42.679
I love you.

30:49.687 --> 30:53.056
Don't you die. Okay?

30:53.091 --> 30:55.192
All right.

30:58.763 --> 31:00.864
Go.

31:03.701 --> 31:07.170
Brennan and Christine
are going to stay with Max.

31:07.205 --> 31:08.505
Booth is right.
He's the one they're afraid of.

31:08.539 --> 31:09.873
That cowboy actually
thinks he can take on

31:09.907 --> 31:11.875
three Delta Force operatives
by himself?

31:11.909 --> 31:14.177
Yeah, well, maybe he won't
have to. So, I pulled this

31:14.212 --> 31:16.513
dichlorofluoroethane
from the soda machine.

31:16.547 --> 31:18.382
It's a coolant.
Now, I collected the fumes

31:18.416 --> 31:20.984
and ran them through a condenser...
Why?

31:21.019 --> 31:22.819
What are you saying?
Well, uh, because this might actually

31:22.854 --> 31:24.955
be able to clean the burned
parts of the chip so that Angie

31:24.989 --> 31:26.169
can get the rest of the 
information off of it.

31:26.194 --> 31:27.424
I'll keep looking through
the names of the

31:27.425 --> 31:29.459
Delta Force personnel-- I
mean, there are thousands

31:29.494 --> 31:31.561
of records, so it's gonna take time.
Which we don't have.

31:31.596 --> 31:33.730
Yeah, we don't have any choice.
Circuits are really delicate,

31:33.765 --> 31:35.432
I hope that this holds up.

31:44.776 --> 31:47.711
I think it's working.

32:48.239 --> 32:50.474
Brennan.

32:50.508 --> 32:51.891
I tried to call Agent Booth,
he didn't pick up.

32:51.916 --> 32:53.310
He won't pick up.

32:53.311 --> 32:54.845
He doesn't trust
his secure line. What is it?

32:54.846 --> 32:57.515
Based on the positions of injuries
to Foster's acromion,

32:58.783 --> 33:00.984
olecranon,
and radial tuberosity,

33:01.018 --> 33:03.987
two of the Delta Force guys are
right-handed and one's a lefty.

33:04.021 --> 33:05.288
That could help Booth discern

33:05.323 --> 33:07.023
from which direction
they would attack.

33:07.058 --> 33:09.693
Or how they'd shoot.
And hand-to-hand maneuvers.

33:09.727 --> 33:11.294
Can you call him?

33:12.830 --> 33:15.365
He won't take any calls now.

33:40.558 --> 33:41.658
Brilliant, Hodgins.

33:41.692 --> 33:44.661
We have access
to everything now.

33:47.899 --> 33:50.567
Hold it, <i>cherie.</i> Those
are the three judges

33:50.601 --> 33:52.435
that denied my warrants.

33:52.470 --> 33:54.471
We might actually
be getting closer.

33:54.505 --> 33:57.374
But aside from the
pictures, it's all encrypted.

33:57.408 --> 33:59.176
What's going on?
Uh, just be quiet

33:59.210 --> 34:01.678
and let me start decrypting.

34:04.582 --> 34:06.016
What's that?

34:07.985 --> 34:09.351
We're being hacked.

34:09.387 --> 34:10.719
Hacked?
Yes, but because

34:10.755 --> 34:11.987
of Pelant, I installed

34:12.023 --> 34:13.857
a fail-safe program
on the server.

34:13.891 --> 34:15.859
It'll give us 90 seconds
to remove all

34:15.893 --> 34:18.061
the vital data
before they shut us down.

34:18.094 --> 34:20.362
They-they know what we're doing?
No. On their end,

34:20.398 --> 34:22.331
they think that we've lost
all the data

34:22.366 --> 34:24.234
and that they've successfully
shut us down.

34:24.268 --> 34:27.704
How long it'll take us
to get back up and running

34:27.737 --> 34:30.106
is another story.

35:37.275 --> 35:39.609
Who are you, huh? Who sent you?

38:23.207 --> 38:25.408
Uh... I'm all right.
Think I'm all right. You're hit.

38:25.443 --> 38:26.943
There's another one
in the house.

38:26.977 --> 38:28.511
Are these two right-handed?

38:28.546 --> 38:30.547
Why? Yes.
'Cause there's one that's left-handed.

38:30.581 --> 38:32.482
That's what I came to tell you.
Just get me

38:32.516 --> 38:34.284
over there in the back.
Come on.

38:34.318 --> 38:37.120
Hand me the gun. Right there.

38:44.428 --> 38:46.096
How bad is it?

38:46.130 --> 38:48.098
It's just a scratch. Behind you.

39:07.751 --> 39:10.553
Oh, Booth.

39:15.826 --> 39:16.826
Booth.

39:16.861 --> 39:18.461
Booth!

39:18.496 --> 39:20.230
No.

39:23.033 --> 39:25.435
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

39:25.469 --> 39:28.371
Don't you die. Oh, God.

39:28.405 --> 39:31.374
Oh, God.

39:31.408 --> 39:34.744
Don't you die. Don't you die.

39:34.778 --> 39:36.880
Booth.

♪ I move away from this place

39:44.355 --> 39:51.461

40:19.557 --> 40:20.790

Yes.

41:25.723 --> 41:26.889
And he's out of danger.

41:26.924 --> 41:27.991
I need to see him.
There is

41:28.025 --> 41:29.759
one problem, Dr. Brennan.

41:29.793 --> 41:31.628
What kind of problem?

41:31.662 --> 41:33.396
Someone will be out
in a minute to talk to you.

41:33.430 --> 41:34.964
Until then,
I think it's important...

41:34.999 --> 41:36.266
Dr. Brennan, wait, wait!

41:45.075 --> 41:46.776
Booth.

41:48.746 --> 41:51.214
Why are you here?
Is someone still after Booth?

41:51.248 --> 41:52.815
Bones.

41:52.850 --> 41:54.117
Dr. Brennan, wait!

41:54.151 --> 41:55.785
You can't be here,

41:55.819 --> 41:57.620
Dr. Brennan.
Why did you handcuff him?

41:57.655 --> 42:00.023
What's going on?
Booth killed three FBI agents

42:00.057 --> 42:00.843
who were coming to serve
a warrant on him.

42:00.868 --> 42:02.225
FBI agents?

42:02.226 --> 42:04.527
Those men tried to kill him.
He was defending himself.

42:04.561 --> 42:06.195
Take Dr. Brennan into custody
for questioning.

42:06.230 --> 42:08.698
No. No, I need to stay with him.

42:08.732 --> 42:09.732
Booth!
Get her out!

42:09.767 --> 42:10.967
Let go of me! Booth!

42:11.001 --> 42:12.235
Get her out!

42:12.269 --> 42:13.803
Booth! Booth!

42:13.837 --> 42:15.638
Let go of me! Booth!
Get her out!

42:15.673 --> 42:17.607
Booth! Booth! Stop it.
Help! Help!

42:17.641 --> 42:19.575
Let go of me! Let go!
