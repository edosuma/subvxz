00:45.125 --> 00:49.915
1 942. The relentless Japanese war machine. . .

00:49.916 --> 00:52.996
rolls down through South East Asia
like a deadly virus.

00:54.541 --> 00:56.501
Australia is open to invasion.

01:05.541 --> 01:09.211
The Americans, their fleet at the bottom of
Pearl Harbour...

01:09.208 --> 01:11.038
. . .and their eyes turned towards
the Philippines...

01:11.166 --> 01:12.456
...are in no position to help.

01:15.750 --> 01:18.920
Ten thousand Japanese make their way
up the narrow trail. . .

01:18.916 --> 01:20.576
...from Kokoda toward us.

01:25.875 --> 01:27.035
We are alone.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.165
Under the direction of our new Colonel. . .

01:45.166 --> 01:48.286
. . .we are digging in at the village
of Isurava on the Kokoda Track.

01:52.291 --> 01:53.621
Weakened by lack of food...

01:53.625 --> 01:54.865
...sleep and shelter...

01:55.416 --> 01:58.116
...many of us are exhausted to the point
of collapse.

01:59.041 --> 02:00.791
We have been here two weeks now,

02:04.833 --> 02:05.623
. . .waiting.

02:18.875 --> 02:21.745
We're told the Australian Army will be here
to relieve us soon.

02:22.708 --> 02:24.118
They are called the AIF.

02:25.541 --> 02:29.961
We're called Chockos,
volunteers sent to New Guinea. . .

02:29.958 --> 02:31.578
...to unload ships and dig roads.

02:32.750 --> 02:34.170
Chocolate soldiers.

02:37.291 --> 02:40.251
The AIF assumes we will melt in
the heat of battle.

02:41.875 --> 02:43.245
They are probably right.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.035
Untrained and ill equipped. . .

02:48.625 --> 02:50.575
. . .riddled with dysentery and malaria...

02:51.666 --> 02:54.996
...we're the only men available to make
a stand against the Japanese.

02:59.583 --> 03:02.793
They outnumber us ten to one,
and will attack any day now.

03:05.791 --> 03:07.831
We are lambs to the slaughter.

05:39.333 --> 05:40.173
Max!

05:41.750 --> 05:42.500
Max.

05:45.208 --> 05:46.618
I'm looking for Max Scholt. He's my brother!

05:52.250 --> 05:55.960
Max! Max Scholt!

05:57.208 --> 06:01.418
Max!

06:04.125 --> 06:04.865
Jack.

06:07.541 --> 06:09.921
Where're you going, Jack? Kokoda's that way.

06:13.958 --> 06:15.498
We're going to Isurava, aren't we?

06:16.750 --> 06:18.710
Hey Jack. Jack.

06:21.291 --> 06:22.461
Take a look, will you Jack?

06:24.625 --> 06:25.995
These blokes won't show me.

06:35.625 --> 06:36.415
No, no.

06:50.375 --> 06:51.665
Oh, Jack...

06:51.666 --> 06:52.706
. . . I'm fucked.

06:54.000 --> 06:54.670
Help me!

06:54.666 --> 06:55.536
Jack!

06:57.500 --> 07:01.000
Christ! Max.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.580
Shh. People still trying to sleep. You right?

07:09.416 --> 07:14.206
Yeah. Some quinine'd be nice.

07:16.166 --> 07:18.576
Sure thing.
I got some beer around here somewhere too.

07:21.416 --> 07:22.286
Hey, take a look.

07:28.916 --> 07:32.996
Bloody AIF. You going out dancing tonight, sir?

07:36.041 --> 07:39.291
Max, go see the quartermaster and pick up
whatever ammo you can for tonight.

07:45.208 --> 07:46.208
Well?

07:59.583 --> 08:01.123
What do you know about our new skipper?

08:01.833 --> 08:02.583
Same as you.

08:03.625 --> 08:06.035
Came up the track three days ago with the Colonel.

08:07.208 --> 08:09.458
6th Division AIF. Decorated.

08:10.541 --> 08:12.081
Sydney Rehab, now here.

08:13.583 --> 08:17.423
An Italian gentleman took exception to him
jumping into his trench in Lib ya.

08:19.375 --> 08:19.995
Soft.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.246
That's his brain.

08:23.333 --> 08:24.293
Now, what do you want?

08:26.000 --> 08:26.670
Quinine.

08:27.416 --> 08:28.616
Got no quinine. You know that.

08:29.708 --> 08:31.418
Nothing up here to stop the malaria.

08:32.457 --> 08:34.207
Get the shakes, got to ride it out.

08:34.957 --> 08:38.788
Got no morphine, got no charcoal,
got nothing but dysentery.

08:39.457 --> 08:42.868
No blankets, no ground sheets, no tobacco.

08:44.333 --> 08:45.423
Got nothing for you.

08:47.333 --> 08:48.423
Got nothing for anyone.

08:52.125 --> 08:53.115
Have you got any hope?

09:02.833 --> 09:04.463
Where there's life there's hope, son.

09:05.583 --> 09:08.463
Courage. . . feeds on hope.

09:11.041 --> 09:13.121
You boys have been in for a beating,
there's no doubt about that.

09:14.250 --> 09:16.710
No one's been looking after you.
No one's even thought about you.

09:16.958 --> 09:19.998
Criminal, sending you up this place.

09:21.041 --> 09:23.291
No experience, no training, nothing.

09:25.333 --> 09:33.503
But now, now, you've got to make a stand.

09:34.083 --> 09:35.173
Can't budge an inch.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.040
You've gotta die here.

09:41.708 --> 09:42.538
All of us. . .

09:44.916 --> 09:45.826
...if we have to.

09:49.541 --> 09:50.421
Oh, Doc.

09:50.833 --> 09:51.753
My little brother.

09:54.291 --> 09:57.421
Look, son. I've been watching this Colonel.

09:58.125 --> 10:00.995
He's been sent to you by God himself.

10:02.083 --> 10:05.503
You put your faith in him,
and that young Lieutenant out there.

10:07.250 --> 10:10.290
The AIF will get here soon,
and you can be going home.

10:13.791 --> 10:16.211
Now, off you go.

10:19.083 --> 10:20.213
Yes, sir.

10:35.791 --> 10:36.421
Corporal.

10:36.666 --> 10:37.366
Sir?

10:39.375 --> 10:40.955
Burke stays number two on the Bren.

10:43.083 --> 10:44.253
Two hours notice to move.

10:45.708 --> 10:50.078
Unless the AIF miraculously appear,
we go out again tonight.

10:53.041 --> 10:54.371
See you after the briefing with the CEO.

11:01.791 --> 11:02.711
Got the makings?

11:05.875 --> 11:07.035
Only boongtwist.

11:11.583 --> 11:12.373
Come on, you blokes.

11:12.750 --> 11:14.330
I want a weapons check in one hour.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.288
Fuck off. . . Ballarat.

11:18.375 --> 11:20.075
That's Lance Corporal to you. . . Bluey.

11:20.875 --> 11:22.285
Fuck off. . . Lance Corporal.

11:27.375 --> 11:27.995
Sixty minutes.

11:36.291 --> 11:37.871
It's a bloody mad house up there.

11:38.541 --> 11:40.331
The new boss has put the wind up 'em.

11:41.958 --> 11:43.578
You'd start to think they knew
what they were doing.

11:46.166 --> 11:47.366
Heads or tails, Scholt?

11:48.500 --> 11:49.540
Piss off, Darko.

11:50.250 --> 11:51.210
I'll give you heads.

11:55.625 --> 11:56.615
Ah, too bad.

11:57.416 --> 11:58.286
We'll miss you.

11:59.041 --> 12:00.001
Here mate, I'll show you.

12:00.666 --> 12:01.416
I know how it's done.

12:03.250 --> 12:04.500
Now, now, Burkey.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.330
Righto, fellas.

12:11.583 --> 12:12.873
You heard the Lance Corporal.

12:13.666 --> 12:16.286
Weapons check in sixty minutes. Johnno!

12:17.291 --> 12:18.291
I gotta shit.

12:19.125 --> 12:20.415
I don't care what you gotta do.

12:20.916 --> 12:22.706
Do not do it without your weapon, right?

12:24.333 --> 12:26.083
Achtung, ya self, Kraut.

12:28.708 --> 12:29.748
Good news, boys.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.000
Are you dying?

12:32.125 --> 12:32.915
Better.

12:33.791 --> 12:34.831
Some mail.

12:35.333 --> 12:37.463
That'd be right. Mail gets through.

12:38.083 --> 12:38.753
Jacko.

12:40.375 --> 12:41.035
Here, Bluey.

12:44.458 --> 12:48.038
Actually, there's no fan mail
for you today, Darko.

12:48.416 --> 12:50.246
Well don't sound so fuckin' pleased
about it, then.

12:53.666 --> 12:54.456
What's she say?

12:57.750 --> 13:01.460
Richmond a hundred and seventy five,
Collingwood thirty seven!

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
Yeah!

13:59.416 --> 14:01.666
Have you heard of General Macarthur,

14:01.666 --> 14:03.916
the hero of Batan

14:04.458 --> 14:08.498
He's come to save Australia
from the Emperor of Japan

14:09.083 --> 14:12.873
Now he's in a Brizzy pub putting up his feet. . .

14:13.458 --> 14:15.668
While the bastards that he left behind

14:15.666 --> 14:17.496
...are up the fuckin' creek.

14:19.708 --> 14:23.368
Have you heard of General Blame hero of Bardia...

14:23.375 --> 14:24.245
. . .and Greece

14:24.708 --> 14:28.788
And who before hostilities was Commissioner
of the Police. . .

14:29.291 --> 14:33.291
Caught in a house
of ill repute one cold and frosty night,

14:33.916 --> 14:36.036
Said Blamey to the copper,

14:36.041 --> 14:37.791
Son, I'm just a little tight.

14:41.250 --> 14:41.920
Boys.

14:43.125 --> 14:44.365
Twenty four hours rations only.

14:46.500 --> 14:47.420
Keep your packs light.

14:52.250 --> 14:56.580
We rotate with 9 Platoon in the forward position
at sixteen hundred, same as yesterday.

14:57.750 --> 14:58.670
Present arms.

15:03.916 --> 15:06.916
Intel is, they will come for us tonight.

15:08.416 --> 15:10.116
You will need to have your wits
about you at all times.

15:11.875 --> 15:13.575
The rest of your mates are dug in tight up there.

15:15.500 --> 15:19.000
They're ready to fight, for as long as it takes.

15:20.083 --> 15:21.003
At any cost.

15:24.583 --> 15:26.213
As forward patrol, we are the front line.

15:28.500 --> 15:29.870
We are the early warning system.

15:32.666 --> 15:35.326
We are the bluff that makes the Nip
think there are more of us than he thought.

15:37.833 --> 15:38.963
The track is your lifeline.

15:41.875 --> 15:43.455
Do not allow yourself to be cut off.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.080
Any news on the AIF, sir?

15:50.250 --> 15:51.170
Be here tomorrow, boys.

15:52.708 --> 15:54.458
Have a cup of tea ready for you, Sam,
when you get back.

15:55.083 --> 15:55.923
How's the stomach?

15:55.958 --> 15:56.748
It's fine thanks, sir.

16:06.250 --> 16:07.460
Got your quinine from the Doc, Jack?

16:09.041 --> 16:09.921
Yes, sir.

16:20.250 --> 16:21.080
Boys.

16:26.541 --> 16:27.501
Let's go.

17:31.041 --> 17:31.961
You got a smoke, dig?

17:33.666 --> 17:34.536
You alright, mate?

17:36.041 --> 17:36.961
Better than him.

17:41.208 --> 17:42.328
Get moving, you lot.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.003
No smoking, no talking.

18:05.625 --> 18:06.865
Never been out this far before.

18:08.291 --> 18:09.501
Must be safe then, eh?

18:29.750 --> 18:31.000
Don't use them all at once.

18:32.333 --> 18:33.503
You little beauty.

18:52.916 --> 18:53.786
Any complaints?

18:54.541 --> 18:55.421
Plenty, sir.

18:56.041 --> 18:56.871
Glad to hear it.

19:18.708 --> 19:19.498
Everything alright, Jim?

19:20.583 --> 19:21.253
Yes, sir.

19:23.916 --> 19:25.326
Would help to have eyes in the back of your head.

19:31.125 --> 19:31.865
Water.

20:07.291 --> 20:09.121
Suppose it'd be inappropriate to ask for leave...

20:09.125 --> 20:11.245
...on the grounds of compassion
at this late juncture.

20:11.750 --> 20:12.960
What grounds would they be, then?

20:15.083 --> 20:17.003
On the grounds I don't want to get
my head blown off.

21:41.083 --> 21:43.373
Das ist der Bank.

21:48.041 --> 21:49.621
Das is das Rathaus.

21:52.166 --> 21:53.706
Das ist die Postamt.

21:57.875 --> 22:03.035
Das ist... hey, what's library again?

22:05.458 --> 22:06.288
You idiot.

22:08.500 --> 22:09.620
Keep your mind on the job.

22:59.958 --> 23:00.828
Nothing.

23:08.916 --> 23:10.076
This is bullshit

23:24.625 --> 23:25.325
Sam!

23:32.708 --> 23:33.918
Where are the bastards?

23:36.666 --> 23:37.576
Sam!

23:47.166 --> 23:49.116
Burkey! Get the fucking mag!

24:06.833 --> 24:08.423
Keep your fucking helmet on, you idiot!

24:10.041 --> 24:10.621
Mag!

24:24.250 --> 24:25.540
Wilstead!

24:26.500 --> 24:28.250
Fuck you! Lance Corporal!

24:30.083 --> 24:30.753
Something's wrong.

24:30.750 --> 24:32.710
We should have heard from the skipper by now.

24:34.041 --> 24:35.371
They're gonna get behind us!

24:40.666 --> 24:43.616
Go! Go fallback position! Go!

24:56.333 --> 24:57.963
What the fuck's going on?

24:57.958 --> 24:59.208
Fucked if I know!

24:59.958 --> 25:01.118
Something's wrong!

25:06.333 --> 25:07.623
They're getting up behind us.

25:07.791 --> 25:09.291
Fall back up to the track.

25:09.291 --> 25:11.711
Burkey! Get out of here!

26:12.125 --> 26:13.365
He's Fuckin' dead!

26:17.375 --> 26:18.745
There's hundreds of the bastards!

26:19.750 --> 26:20.790
Up to the track!

26:27.916 --> 26:30.826
Back! Fall back! Fall back!

26:30.833 --> 26:32.293
Not on your life!

26:32.583 --> 26:34.083
Come on, you bastards!

26:35.500 --> 26:37.330
Fall back! No more... we can do here!

26:37.625 --> 26:42.165
- No!
- Go! I'll cover! Move!

26:42.166 --> 26:43.036
Reload!

26:43.375 --> 26:44.165
Fall back!

26:44.375 --> 26:45.745
Go, go. I'll cover!

26:48.000 --> 26:48.750
Fall back!

26:48.750 --> 26:49.620
Go!

26:52.291 --> 26:53.921
- Move.
- Come on, Johnno!

27:00.541 --> 27:01.211
See you at the fallback position!

27:01.208 --> 27:02.538
Yeah, go... go!

27:08.000 --> 27:08.830
Johnno!

27:11.416 --> 27:12.536
Blue's covering.

27:16.208 --> 27:17.038
Where's?

27:18.625 --> 27:19.415
Shit.

28:13.208 --> 28:14.078
Where's Johnno?

28:15.541 --> 28:16.501
He was behind me.

28:16.500 --> 28:17.080
Blue?

28:17.583 --> 28:18.543
Not back yet.

28:19.541 --> 28:20.541
He's fucked.

28:21.083 --> 28:22.423
Shut up, you stupid mick

28:22.416 --> 28:23.166
Sam.

28:24.375 --> 28:27.325
Oh, fuck! Field... dressing, Burkey! Now!

28:27.833 --> 28:29.623
Sorry. . . boys, I didn't realise.

29:18.500 --> 29:19.330
Scholt, sir.

29:20.208 --> 29:21.458
Yeah, the skipper's gone west.

29:23.416 --> 29:24.536
Missing another three.

29:25.666 --> 29:26.706
We're at the second position.

29:27.750 --> 29:29.500
No, no, no, no, more than that.

29:29.958 --> 29:31.208
Company strength at least. Yep.

29:33.291 --> 29:34.831
Like ants, in from Deniki.

29:36.958 --> 29:39.958
Sir? Sir?

29:42.458 --> 29:43.208
Shit.

29:43.500 --> 29:44.290
Shut up.

29:44.333 --> 29:49.123
No, no. Smell. What's that stink?

30:03.375 --> 30:04.365
I shit me pants.

30:08.833 --> 30:10.713
Don't worry, mate. So did I.

30:13.416 --> 30:14.496
Where the hell are youse?

30:17.333 --> 30:18.003
Idiot!

30:18.791 --> 30:20.121
I can't find Blue!

30:21.875 --> 30:22.535
Blue!

30:22.958 --> 30:24.748
Shut up!

30:25.583 --> 30:26.373
Shut up.

30:33.541 --> 30:34.251
He's me mate.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.290
He's not your mate.
He thinks you're a little prick

30:36.291 --> 30:37.171
Pack it in, Darko.

30:42.541 --> 30:43.211
I'll go.

30:44.833 --> 30:45.713
This is stupid.

30:46.291 --> 30:48.171
If it was you,
you'd want us to come lookin' for ya.

30:48.708 --> 30:49.958
Not if I was dead, mate.

30:54.500 --> 30:55.330
I'll go by meself.

30:55.458 --> 30:56.668
No you damn well won't!

30:57.041 --> 30:57.671
You.

30:58.791 --> 30:59.751
Stay where you are.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.120
Darko and I'll go.

31:03.041 --> 31:04.041
Who made you chief?

31:07.291 --> 31:08.331
All those in favour?

31:15.625 --> 31:16.455
This is bullshit.

31:16.791 --> 31:18.251
Well why'd you leave him, then?

31:18.250 --> 31:19.330
Righto, enough!

31:23.250 --> 31:24.210
You do as I say.

31:25.333 --> 31:26.043
Agreed?

31:27.000 --> 31:27.870
Don't I always?

31:35.916 --> 31:37.206
Righ to you lot, you hold tight.

31:37.708 --> 31:39.328
Keep checking the phone.
It might just be the line.

31:39.833 --> 31:43.333
Sam, as soon as you're fit, back to Isurava, mate.

31:44.458 --> 31:46.038
We'll have to go up over the ridge and come down.

31:46.916 --> 31:47.786
Track's theirs now.

31:48.500 --> 31:49.080
Burke.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.290
Bren's yours. Don't break it.

34:52.000 --> 34:53.000
What are you doing here?

34:54.291 --> 34:55.170
We're cut off.

34:55.833 --> 34:57.673
1 0 Platoon got back to Isurava.

34:58.666 --> 34:59.416
Max?

35:00.833 --> 35:01.423
Christ!

35:04.166 --> 35:05.036
We gotta go!

35:06.625 --> 35:07.575
Now!

35:20.958 --> 35:27.668
We're right.

35:39.416 --> 35:40.366
We've got to find the others.

35:41.208 --> 35:42.538
They would have gone this way up the ridge.

35:43.041 --> 35:44.541
Try to hook back in behind Isurava.

35:45.125 --> 35:46.915
If the Japs are coming in from Kokoda that way. . .

35:47.333 --> 35:50.003
...they won't go there, it's too steep.
They'll follow the track.

35:53.416 --> 35:54.366
You makin' that up?

36:22.500 --> 36:23.370
What is it?

37:49.833 --> 37:50.753
Any food?

38:47.750 --> 38:48.460
It's started.

38:50.208 --> 38:51.168
Poor bastards.

38:52.375 --> 38:53.285
We gotta get back.

38:55.583 --> 38:56.333
Yeah.

38:58.666 --> 38:59.916
First we got to find the others.

39:03.916 --> 39:04.866
They could be anywhere.

39:06.125 --> 39:07.285
That's our mates up there.

39:08.125 --> 39:09.205
That's where we're needed.

39:11.250 --> 39:12.620
You don't have any mates, Darko.

39:58.625 --> 40:02.165
You shoot me, Darko, I'll haunt you for the rest
of your miserable bloody life!

40:10.541 --> 40:13.081
Forty seconds. Too slow, Burkey. Come on, mate!

40:31.333 --> 40:32.173
Where are they?

40:36.250 --> 40:36.960
Where's Blue?

40:40.250 --> 40:40.790
Dan?

40:45.666 --> 40:46.576
Where's Blue, you bastards?

40:46.583 --> 40:47.833
They tied him to a tree and gutted him,

40:47.833 --> 40:49.373
then they cut his head off.

40:55.166 --> 40:56.076
Got anything to eat?

40:58.125 --> 41:00.205
You're a real sick bastard, Darko.

41:19.041 --> 41:22.081
Go on. Get back in there and eat something...

41:22.083 --> 41:24.213
...before Darko polishes it all off.

41:25.291 --> 41:26.621
There's no more after that's gone.

41:59.833 --> 42:02.083
Goes to prove you only want something
when you can't have it.

42:15.125 --> 42:16.285
You did good yesterday, kid.

42:18.916 --> 42:19.496
Johnno.

42:20.416 --> 42:21.286
Aren't you eating?

42:26.458 --> 42:27.668
Waste not, want not.

42:40.125 --> 42:41.415
The creek's our best way back.

42:42.708 --> 42:44.118
How do we know it's the right creek?

42:44.125 --> 42:50.115
I don't, but we got cut off up there.
Isurava's that way.

42:50.541 --> 42:51.671
The creek's gotta take us up close.

42:53.041 --> 42:53.871
What about Sam?

42:54.083 --> 42:54.873
What about him?

42:58.291 --> 42:59.211
We carry him.

43:04.541 --> 43:06.251
We make a stretcher and take turns.

43:12.916 --> 43:15.116
Gotta get back there now. No good out here.

43:15.125 --> 43:16.115
Sam's gonna have to do his best.

43:16.208 --> 43:19.168
Priority has to be holding Isurava.
That's what we're here for.

43:19.583 --> 43:20.543
I'll tell him.

43:27.958 --> 43:28.668
We're moving out. Now.

43:29.208 --> 43:31.788
Yeah, thought that might be on your mind.

43:32.833 --> 43:34.003
Just help me get off the ground, will ya?

44:53.750 --> 44:54.460
What's that?

45:06.666 --> 45:08.036
Oh, I gotta shit.

45:11.125 --> 45:11.865
Come here.

45:22.208 --> 45:23.368
Give you some ventilation.

46:09.708 --> 46:10.748
Does it ever end?

46:11.708 --> 46:13.248
What are you gonna do, mate? Stay here?

46:14.458 --> 46:15.668
Come on. If Sam can do it...

46:54.958 --> 46:57.038
Too slow. He's dead.

46:57.708 --> 46:58.578
We're dead.

47:28.791 --> 47:30.541
Come on, stop dawdling.

48:01.208 --> 48:02.328
Oh, shit.

48:27.125 --> 48:27.955
Wrong way, mate.

48:31.666 --> 48:33.286
Oh, bugger me.

49:18.666 --> 49:19.666
I'll take watch.

49:20.583 --> 49:21.293
I'll take it.

50:20.708 --> 50:21.538
Max.

52:42.916 --> 52:43.786
Max!

52:46.750 --> 52:47.790
Sam, you old bastard.

52:47.791 --> 52:48.541
Max!

52:58.291 --> 52:58.871
Darko?

53:00.125 --> 53:00.615
Clear!

53:00.666 --> 53:01.496
I got him!

53:02.125 --> 53:04.535
Max!

53:08.791 --> 53:09.711
I'm fucked, Jack!

53:10.708 --> 53:12.248
- Hold on, mate.
- Burkey, bandages!

53:15.708 --> 53:17.998
It's a small wound, mate. You're gonna be alright.

53:18.083 --> 53:18.873
You're gonna be alright!

53:19.250 --> 53:20.080
It's a small wound!

53:21.000 --> 53:22.080
We gotta get out of here!

53:22.250 --> 53:23.080
He can't walk!

53:23.833 --> 53:24.833
We'll have to carry him!

53:26.250 --> 53:26.830
Fuck.

53:37.833 --> 53:39.083
What are we gonna do with this Jap?

53:45.083 --> 53:46.753
We need some poles. I'll cover.

53:57.291 --> 53:58.081
Leave me.

53:59.208 --> 53:59.998
No way, mate.

54:29.333 --> 54:29.923
It's clear.

54:31.208 --> 54:32.168
I need a breather, fellas.

54:32.500 --> 54:33.920
Keep going, you bastard.

55:10.916 --> 55:12.246
Don't you lose it on me, Johnno!

55:23.125 --> 55:24.415
Shit, Johnno!

55:30.541 --> 55:31.211
Right, mate?

55:33.958 --> 55:34.788
Good fella.

56:02.833 --> 56:03.583
Burkey.

56:13.333 --> 56:14.003
How're you feeling?

56:15.000 --> 56:15.750
Yeah, good.

56:17.333 --> 56:18.333
Has to lead somewhere.

56:19.875 --> 56:22.035
I'll give you twenty minutes,
then we'll start after you.

57:05.125 --> 57:06.575
Right, let's go.

57:13.833 --> 57:15.123
You gonna carry for two?

57:17.125 --> 57:18.075
If I have to.

58:00.458 --> 58:02.578
Johnno, Burkey,
see if you can scrounge up some food.

58:22.708 --> 58:23.498
He's dead, Jack.

58:25.083 --> 58:26.083
Gut wound up here

58:26.666 --> 58:28.916
Eight days back on the track
he's not going to make it back to Moresby.

58:37.291 --> 58:38.501
We're not leaving him.

59:09.833 --> 59:10.833
You've changed your tune.

59:12.958 --> 59:13.668
This is different.

59:14.125 --> 59:14.705
How?

59:18.708 --> 59:22.168
Sam knew what he was doing. What's up you?

59:22.625 --> 59:23.495
We gotta get back.

59:24.791 --> 59:27.751
I'm not going to bloody die in some nowhere
jungle shit hole without doing my bit.

59:29.000 --> 59:31.370
Get back to the track and stop these Jap bastards.

59:32.291 --> 59:35.751
Don't stop 'em now they're in Morseby
and Australia is gone. I believe that.

59:36.500 --> 59:37.790
No good all of us dying here.

59:38.291 --> 59:40.421
Our blokes, sounds like they're holding
the Japs back.

59:40.416 --> 59:41.616
You can do some good, too.

59:42.000 --> 59:42.620
Not here.

59:42.625 --> 59:43.865
Piss off, then. Go on, piss off.

59:43.875 --> 59:44.495
I'm not your enemy!

59:44.500 --> 59:45.170
Hey.

59:46.166 --> 59:47.326
That's it, you blokes.

59:50.541 --> 59:51.331
I'll be right here.

59:54.125 --> 59:55.825
You can send some fuzzies back to get me.

59:57.083 --> 59:57.923
No way, mate.

59:58.916 --> 01:00:00.456
Come on, Jack, he's right.

01:00:03.083 --> 01:00:03.873
I'm dead.

01:00:08.166 --> 01:00:09.326
Just leave me some ammo.

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:12.371
We're not leavin' ya.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.250
What's this "we"?

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:16.870
It's the "we" you agreed to make me leader of.

01:00:19.541 --> 01:00:20.331
I'll stay with him.

01:00:21.083 --> 01:00:23.583
No, you won't. Not on my account.

01:00:23.666 --> 01:00:25.206
No way, Johnno. We all go back.

01:00:25.333 --> 01:00:26.543
No, I wanna stay.

01:00:29.958 --> 01:00:31.078
Burke's your number two.

01:00:34.666 --> 01:00:36.366
And Jack, you're no help to anyone here.

01:00:38.041 --> 01:00:38.871
I'm done.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.330
I've got nothin' left in me.

01:00:46.375 --> 01:00:48.035
I can put up a stand if I have to.

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:53.330
Best thing is to get back to the track
and send up some stretcher bearers.

01:00:53.625 --> 01:00:56.205
He's got a better chance that way than us
sitting around here watching him.

01:00:56.208 --> 01:00:57.118
We're not going.

01:00:58.291 --> 01:00:59.371
Fuck!

01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:45.330
Canes'll be shooting on the vines pretty soon.

01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:52.080
Pa'll sack Pat O'Brien again for taking bets on
what day they come.

01:01:56.291 --> 01:01:57.211
He better watch out.

01:02:00.333 --> 01:02:01.963
Pat might take him seriously.

01:02:02.833 --> 01:02:03.833
No, never.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.210
What are you doing, Jack?

01:02:20.375 --> 01:02:21.535
I'm not leaving you.

01:02:26.166 --> 01:02:27.996
Remember when Dad used to read to us?

01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:35.173
What. . . what was that, um. . .?

01:02:40.208 --> 01:02:44.538
Death comes with a crawl, or with a pounce

01:02:45.833 --> 01:02:48.173
And whether he's slow or spry

01:02:50.916 --> 01:02:53.036
It's not the fact that you're dead that counts

01:02:56.458 --> 01:02:57.998
Only how did you die.

01:03:02.833 --> 01:03:04.423
He'd understand, Jack?

01:03:08.666 --> 01:03:10.286
You're not responsible.

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:17.915
I said I'd take care of you.

01:03:22.041 --> 01:03:22.871
I promised

01:03:22.875 --> 01:03:24.075
You have, Jack.

01:03:25.166 --> 01:03:26.286
You did your best.

01:03:30.791 --> 01:03:31.921
You shouldn't be here.

01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:34.080
None of us should be here.

01:03:36.875 --> 01:03:38.245
I could always rely on you, Jack.

01:03:40.708 --> 01:03:42.248
Could always trust you.

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:44.500
We all could.

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:48.830
You've gotta trust me on this.

01:04:28.583 --> 01:04:30.503
You want to say something for these poor bastards?

01:04:34.791 --> 01:04:36.581
I've got nothing to say anymore.

01:04:41.666 --> 01:04:42.576
You gonna stay?

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:16.921
We'll see you at Isurava. Right?

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:44.540
Bibliothek.

01:05:47.416 --> 01:05:48.616
It's German for library.

01:06:25.416 --> 01:06:26.366
Terrific.

01:07:08.916 --> 01:07:09.996
You gonna leave me now?

01:07:11.625 --> 01:07:14.535
Slow us down, I'll kill you myself.

01:07:35.375 --> 01:07:39.075
Ohh, feels like me guts are coming out of me bum.

01:07:43.416 --> 01:07:44.326
So where you reckon they are?

01:07:46.041 --> 01:07:46.871
The Japs?

01:07:49.166 --> 01:07:50.746
Still trying to take Isurava.

01:07:52.375 --> 01:07:54.035
I didn't think we could hold this long.

01:07:54.791 --> 01:07:55.871
It's bloody marvellous.

01:08:04.083 --> 01:08:04.963
Which way?

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.370
Up or down?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.250
Heads down, tails up.

01:08:31.582 --> 01:08:32.423
Had to be.

01:08:35.666 --> 01:08:36.666
No offence, Burke. . .

01:08:37.332 --> 01:08:38.423
. . .but after what you just described...

01:08:38.416 --> 01:08:39.746
. . . I don't want to be underneath you.

01:08:40.832 --> 01:08:41.752
You go last.

01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:10.620
No idea?

01:09:12.207 --> 01:09:12.917
Nah.

01:09:14.207 --> 01:09:16.247
Just left on the doorstep of
the Brigidine Convent.

01:09:20.291 --> 01:09:21.871
How'd you come by your name, then?

01:09:23.625 --> 01:09:27.705
Well the nuns called all the kids
dumped on them John, after their priest.

01:09:29.291 --> 01:09:31.081
I think they figured they were doing us
all a favour.

01:09:36.707 --> 01:09:38.078
Then I was sent to the seminary...

01:09:40.500 --> 01:09:42.040
...but I cleared out of there as soon as I could.

01:09:45.125 --> 01:09:49.245
And the AIF wouldn't take me, so here I am.

01:09:51.166 --> 01:09:54.826
Our family's been in Bendigo fifty years
making wine.

01:09:57.666 --> 01:09:59.666
You can come and stay with us if you like.

01:10:01.208 --> 01:10:02.328
There's plenty of room.

01:10:06.208 --> 01:10:08.038
Wouldn't drink any of that grape piss, but.

01:10:09.916 --> 01:10:10.916
Bloody heathen.

01:10:21.083 --> 01:10:23.253
Never thought I'd be mates
with a Kraut in all this.

01:10:29.125 --> 01:10:30.365
Things change, I s'pose.

01:13:07.791 --> 01:13:09.041
You're an idiot, Darko!

01:13:17.166 --> 01:13:18.616
You stupid idiot, Darko!

01:13:38.583 --> 01:13:39.463
Holy shit.

01:13:41.791 --> 01:13:42.621
Fuck you!

01:13:54.625 --> 01:13:55.615
Hey fellas.

01:13:57.916 --> 01:13:58.666
Hey fellas!

01:14:03.416 --> 01:14:04.076
We made it.

01:14:07.625 --> 01:14:08.365
Hey!

01:14:13.291 --> 01:14:15.041
Don't fire you fucking idiots, we're Aussies!

01:14:18.083 --> 01:14:18.753
Are they Japs?

01:14:20.625 --> 01:14:22.325
What wharf. . . did you leave from in Sydney?

01:14:26.625 --> 01:14:27.865
Woolloomoolloo!

01:14:28.583 --> 01:14:29.503
Can't hear ya!

01:14:30.708 --> 01:14:32.668
Woolloomoolloo, you stupid bastard!

01:14:35.375 --> 01:14:36.455
No, need to get personal.

01:14:39.833 --> 01:14:40.753
Who are you blokes?

01:14:40.833 --> 01:14:41.753
2nd 1 6th.

01:14:44.708 --> 01:14:46.918
Bloody rainbows took your time.

01:14:50.583 --> 01:14:51.293
Where are we?

01:14:51.625 --> 01:14:54.495
Just west of Alola HQ. That track'll get you there.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:58.750
The 39th?

01:14:59.333 --> 01:15:01.753
Still in it. Blood's worth bottling.

01:15:03.208 --> 01:15:06.118
We got two still out there.
Got to go back for 'em.

01:15:06.666 --> 01:15:08.166
Fuzzies been bringing people in all day.

01:15:08.916 --> 01:15:10.286
Lot of people getting lost in the bush.

01:15:11.166 --> 01:15:13.326
Go back to Alola. Could be waiting for you.

01:15:30.791 --> 01:15:31.751
You right, mate?

01:19:41.541 --> 01:19:42.371
Let's get some food.

01:19:43.958 --> 01:19:45.038
Go see the doc, Burke.

01:19:46.708 --> 01:19:47.828
There's others worse than me.

01:19:57.625 --> 01:20:01.455
Jack, I. . .

01:20:09.208 --> 01:20:10.458
Okay you lot, who's next?

01:20:10.750 --> 01:20:12.790
Chests and guts first, then arms and legs.

01:20:19.208 --> 01:20:21.078
Hey mate, how's the 39th holding up?

01:20:22.375 --> 01:20:23.745
Gonna be stuffed without reos soon.

01:20:25.916 --> 01:20:27.206
What's happening, mate?

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:52.330
Hey, wait a minute.

01:20:52.333 --> 01:20:53.123
Where are you going?

01:21:01.541 --> 01:21:03.871
No. No, boys.

01:21:11.375 --> 01:21:12.115
No.

01:21:44.375 --> 01:21:45.705
You lot. Who are you?

01:21:47.791 --> 01:21:48.501
39th.

01:21:49.708 --> 01:21:51.458
39th are falling back through us.

01:21:52.125 --> 01:21:55.955
You dig in here, help cover their withdrawal
with the 2nd 14th AIF.

01:21:57.625 --> 01:21:58.415
Over there.

01:22:24.625 --> 01:22:25.075
Hey.

01:22:26.416 --> 01:22:27.166
Got any food?

01:22:29.250 --> 01:22:30.250
Bloody Chockos.

01:22:44.250 --> 01:22:44.960
Who'd have thought it.

01:22:45.458 --> 01:22:47.788
Chockos and the Deep Thinkers
in the same bloody hole.

01:22:53.333 --> 01:22:54.753
Got any ammo, mate?

01:24:00.333 --> 01:24:08.463
Corporal White!

01:24:10.916 --> 01:24:11.746
Jack!

01:24:14.458 --> 01:24:15.458
Jack! Are you there, Jack?

01:24:16.333 --> 01:24:17.253
Jack!

01:24:17.625 --> 01:24:18.495
Steady, boys.

01:24:19.041 --> 01:24:19.871
Hold your fire.

01:24:20.958 --> 01:24:21.708
Jack. . .

01:24:21.833 --> 01:24:22.923
. . .you die tonight!

01:24:25.208 --> 01:24:26.538
Come on, you bastards. Have a go!

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:57.328
Jesus.

01:25:53.625 --> 01:25:55.075
Battalion is ready for you now, sir.

01:25:55.333 --> 01:25:56.083
Very good.

01:26:10.083 --> 01:26:11.003
At ease.

01:26:17.333 --> 01:26:18.963
Now I don't know a lot of you by name...

01:26:21.291 --> 01:26:22.171
. . .but I know you.

01:26:24.375 --> 01:26:31.495
We met at Isurava, and we fought there
together and every step of the way here.

01:26:34.791 --> 01:26:36.961
And now we are relieved,
and we will leave the battle.

01:26:42.666 --> 01:26:43.666
Reload, Burkey!

01:26:47.208 --> 01:26:48.208
Get it in there!

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:51.670
Shit.

01:26:57.166 --> 01:27:01.746
And every day,
the enemy's supply line stretches further

01:27:03.791 --> 01:27:05.171
And he suffers now

01:27:06.791 --> 01:27:07.871
. . .as you have suffered.

01:27:10.833 --> 01:27:13.003
The battle you have fought for the track. . .

01:27:14.625 --> 01:27:15.915
...may just save your nation.

01:27:19.416 --> 01:27:20.166
We have wounded him.

01:27:23.583 --> 01:27:24.463
We will stop him.

01:27:43.291 --> 01:27:46.371
Burkey, reload! Burkey!

01:27:47.791 --> 01:27:49.001
Burkey!

01:27:51.166 --> 01:27:52.996
Come on Burkey, reload!

01:28:29.500 --> 01:28:31.330
The Brigadier wants you to know. . .

01:28:33.791 --> 01:28:35.501
...your gallantry, your courage. . .

01:28:36.875 --> 01:28:37.615
...your fortitude. . .

01:28:37.625 --> 01:28:38.865
...are an inspiration.

01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:43.420
And I want you to know. . .

01:28:46.791 --> 01:28:49.211
. . .that you are some of the finest soldiers
I have ever seen.

01:28:54.333 --> 01:28:57.793
You have seen things in this place that
no man should witness.

01:29:00.916 --> 01:29:02.576
Some of these things you must forget.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.370
For history will remember you. . .

01:29:09.791 --> 01:29:11.001
. . .and in the years to come. . .

01:29:13.541 --> 01:29:18.041
. . .others will wish that they had your conviction.

01:29:27.458 --> 01:29:28.288
Remember.

01:29:32.541 --> 01:29:35.211
Remember that glory is not
the exaltation of war...

01:29:36.166 --> 01:29:37.666
. . .but the exaltation of man.

01:29:39.833 --> 01:29:45.123
Man's nobility, made transcendent,
in the fiery crucible of war.

01:29:55.916 --> 01:29:58.666
Faithfulness and fortitude...

01:30:01.125 --> 01:30:02.285
...gentleness and compassion.

01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:08.210
I am honoured to be your brother.
