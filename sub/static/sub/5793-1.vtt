02:16.636 --> 02:18.797
Wondermutt, go get Bob.

02:20.540 --> 02:25.034
Hey, guys! You all got
your grade cards, right?

02:26.045 --> 02:27.637
OK.

02:27.847 --> 02:29.371
What have we learned this year?

02:29.582 --> 02:32.847
Teamwork, sportsmanship,
how your friends look naked.

02:33.553 --> 02:35.851
You'll notice your
grade cards are blank.

02:36.055 --> 02:39.718
Who better to evaluate a student's
progress than the student himself?

02:42.529 --> 02:43.894
Good morning, young people.

02:44.597 --> 02:47.498
Vice Principal Gills has
some words for you. Mr. Gills.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.827
Thank you, Principal Kelban.

02:52.238 --> 02:56.174
Well, well, I suppose you all remember
the English skills test last month.

02:56.376 --> 02:57.741
- No.
- No.

02:57.944 --> 02:59.969
- I had English?
- The dot-to-dot puzzle?

03:00.180 --> 03:02.546
Yeah, that was it, yeah.
No, I don't remember.

03:02.749 --> 03:05.377
I'm not surprised.
All of you failed.

03:05.585 --> 03:09.612
However, in accordance with policies
on minimum academic proficiencies,

03:09.822 --> 03:12.188
you'll have the opportunity
to retake the exam.

03:12.392 --> 03:14.326
- Great.
- Oh, joy, I have a boner now.

03:19.332 --> 03:22.426
- Hi. I'm all packed. Are you ready?
- One minute to go.

03:24.304 --> 03:27.796
Your parents have been notified
you'll be retested after completing

03:28.007 --> 03:31.909
the mandatory course in remedial
English. In summer school.

03:32.111 --> 03:34.341
- What?
- We just finished a whole semester

03:34.547 --> 03:36.174
and we gotta go
to summer school?

03:36.382 --> 03:40.944
- You're crazy. I ain't going.
- My grandmother's gonna kill me.

03:41.154 --> 03:46.057
Twenty, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15,

03:46.259 --> 03:49.057
fourteen, 13, 12,

03:49.262 --> 03:53.631
eleven, ten, nine, eight,

03:53.833 --> 03:57.291
seven, six, five, four,

03:57.503 --> 04:00.631
three, two, one!

04:19.559 --> 04:21.459
I won! I won!

04:25.531 --> 04:26.828
I won! I won!

04:29.569 --> 04:31.799
Gills, Kelban. I did it, I did it.

04:32.005 --> 04:34.235
Look at this puppy.
50,000 big ones.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.374
Know what this means?
No summer school.

04:36.576 --> 04:38.237
Wait, you gave me your word.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.776
That was the old word.
My new one is "money".

04:40.980 --> 04:44.006
You would let 50 grand weaken
your commitment to education?

04:44.217 --> 04:47.186
Lesser men win millions,
go right back to busing tables!

04:47.387 --> 04:50.447
They're frigging morons!

04:51.090 --> 04:53.923
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

04:54.127 --> 04:56.721
Don't look at me.
You're in charge of summer school.

05:02.035 --> 05:04.003
- May I speak with you a minute?
- Sure.

05:04.203 --> 05:07.036
I need you to teach summer school.
Dearadorian just quit.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.641
- Didn't he teach remedial English?
- Well, yes... Winnick!

05:11.544 --> 05:13.444
Musway!

05:17.283 --> 05:18.511
Stop! Stop!

05:20.253 --> 05:22.153
Mary!

05:23.222 --> 05:24.883
I have to talk to you.

05:28.227 --> 05:30.354
Kim, get in the car.

05:30.963 --> 05:35.593
It's OK. I'll meet you at the airport.
I'll get a cab. Take Wondermutt.

05:41.774 --> 05:43.537
Shoop.

05:44.477 --> 05:46.172
All right.

05:47.547 --> 05:49.515
Mr. Shoop. Oh, Mr. Shoop.

05:51.317 --> 05:54.252
Congratulations. You've been chosen
to teach summer school.

05:54.454 --> 05:56.319
Shoot.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.149
If only I'd known sooner.

05:58.358 --> 06:01.987
- We're going to Hawaii.
- May I remind you, Mr. Shoop,

06:02.195 --> 06:04.686
you're up for tenure.
You want a job next year?

06:04.897 --> 06:07.866
Come on, Mr. Gills.
Look, we got leis on and everything.

06:08.067 --> 06:10.035
You'll be teaching remedial English.

06:10.236 --> 06:13.069
Remedial English?
Look, I ain't no English teacher.

06:13.272 --> 06:15.297
See? Double negative.

06:15.508 --> 06:20.138
No, I hand out basketballs, check for
jockstraps. I'm, like, very challenged.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.610
- I'm not a real teacher.
- That's all right.

06:22.815 --> 06:26.148
These aren't real students.
They're unmotivated, irresponsible.

06:26.352 --> 06:28.980
- They'll relate to you.
- I appreciate that.

06:29.188 --> 06:33.648
No, the reason I got into this whole
teaching gig was to get summers off.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.851
No, I'm afraid my answer
has to be no.

06:37.630 --> 06:38.858
No, thank you?

06:39.065 --> 06:41.966
Bottom line, you need
my recommendation for tenure.

06:42.168 --> 06:43.635
This is blackmail.

06:44.604 --> 06:46.936
We call it school spirit.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.711
Kim.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.947
Have you ever seen
The Wizard of Oz?

06:59.152 --> 07:01.814
- Oh, I love that movie.
- Yeah. Yeah, me too.

07:02.021 --> 07:05.513
And my favorite part is when Dorothy,
she clicks her heels together

07:05.725 --> 07:08.193
and she says,
"There's no place like home.

07:08.394 --> 07:11.386
"There is no place like home."

07:11.597 --> 07:13.758
Oh, Shoop, I understand.

07:13.966 --> 07:16.434
You do? You're not disappointed?

07:16.636 --> 07:20.470
No. I'll just go by myself.

07:20.873 --> 07:23.501
- What, alone?
- I'll make friends.

07:23.709 --> 07:28.271
Look, Kim, if you love me, even if you
just like me a lot, you won't do this.

07:28.481 --> 07:33.111
If I didn't like you, I wouldn't ask you
to drive me to the airport, now would I?

07:34.787 --> 07:36.152
Guess not.

07:36.355 --> 07:39.290
You're in room 43.

07:39.492 --> 07:42.188
Files on your students.

07:42.728 --> 07:44.355
A word to the wise, Mr. Shoop:

07:44.564 --> 07:46.964
Right off the bat,
you show them who's in charge.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.463
Great.

07:49.101 --> 07:50.932
Who is in charge?

07:55.141 --> 07:56.369
Very cute.

07:57.844 --> 07:59.778
Thanks. So are you.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.542
Oh, you meant...

08:04.050 --> 08:07.281
Jeez, I'm so embarrassed.
But you are cute.

08:07.487 --> 08:11.446
I'm all right. I'm Robin Bishop.
I teach American history next door.

08:11.657 --> 08:14.922
Hi, Freddy Shoop.
Remedial English, right here.

08:15.127 --> 08:16.355
Everybody calls me Shoop.

08:16.562 --> 08:19.224
OK, Shoop.

08:20.766 --> 08:23.530
Why am I here? Oh, thumbtacks.
Could I borrow some?

08:23.736 --> 08:26.933
Sure. I was just gonna get my
summer bulletin board going here.

08:27.840 --> 08:30.365
Jackpot. Whole box.
Here you go, my treat.

08:30.576 --> 08:34.568
- But what about your bulletin board?
- Oh, yeah. Give me one.

08:36.115 --> 08:37.775
Remedial English, huh?

08:37.984 --> 08:41.147
I got it easy, I have honor students.
They're here voluntarily.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.981
- Believe it?
- No.

08:43.188 --> 08:44.952
I've seen some of your students.

08:45.157 --> 08:48.024
Very scary.
You must be a good teacher.

08:48.728 --> 08:51.390
Shucks, Robin, I don't know.

08:52.431 --> 08:55.992
Heck, inside every so-called
bad kid is a good kid

08:56.202 --> 08:59.330
waiting for someone to reach down
through the sleaze and slime,

08:59.539 --> 09:01.769
pick him up
and hose him off.

09:01.974 --> 09:05.705
If we fail with even one child, we
might be losing the next Ted Koppel.

09:07.446 --> 09:09.573
We're the unsung heroes
doing God's work.

09:09.782 --> 09:11.443
You're not wearing
a wedding ring.

09:11.651 --> 09:14.051
Yeah, my mother noticed that too.

09:14.253 --> 09:17.381
So you're single. In love? Involved?
What's the story here?

09:17.590 --> 09:20.286
The story is that I've been
seeing someone.

09:20.493 --> 09:24.361
But we just started dating,
so you do what you think's right.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.759
- OK.
- I better get going.

09:26.966 --> 09:29.093
Well, here, I'll walk you.

09:30.703 --> 09:32.933
So you're free to see
other people, then?

09:33.139 --> 09:34.504
Are you asking me out?

09:34.707 --> 09:37.403
- Well, if I was, would you say yes?
- I might.

09:37.610 --> 09:40.204
Well, I might be asking you out.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.438
- You like Chinese?
- I hate it.

09:42.648 --> 09:44.047
Me too. I can't stand it.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.115
Wanna go out and not eat Chinese?

09:46.319 --> 09:47.581
I might.

09:47.787 --> 09:50.119
Why don't we talk
about that after school.

09:55.061 --> 09:56.926
I'm in love again.

09:59.665 --> 10:02.225
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
The crowd goes mild.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.699
- Hey, wow.
- Kevin?

10:04.904 --> 10:07.065
- What happened to football, buddy?
- Yeah.

10:07.273 --> 10:09.571
I was kicked off the team
for being stupid.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.208
All right, it's about time.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.105
Congratulations, bud.

10:16.082 --> 10:17.640
Sorry I'm late.

10:20.853 --> 10:24.721
Hey, Mr. Shoop, wow.
You in this class too?

10:25.858 --> 10:28.452
- I'm teaching it.
- No way!

10:28.661 --> 10:30.925
Party all the time
Party all the time

10:31.130 --> 10:33.098
My girl likes to party all the time

10:33.299 --> 10:36.962
All right, have a seat.
Let's see who the lucky winners are.

10:39.071 --> 10:41.665
Larry Kazimias. Where's Larry?

10:43.643 --> 10:45.543
He's nocturnal.

10:45.745 --> 10:47.576
Oh, OK.

10:47.780 --> 10:50.943
Try and keep it down.
Francis Gremp?

10:51.150 --> 10:53.880
Don't ever call me that.
The name is Chainsaw.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.216
- As in Black & Decker?
- As in Texas Massacre.

10:57.423 --> 10:59.857
- Oh, yeah, that's in here.
- It's in there.

11:00.059 --> 11:02.653
- They got files on us.
- Pam House.

11:05.998 --> 11:09.058
Says here you lack concentration.

11:12.238 --> 11:13.603
Pam?

11:18.210 --> 11:19.837
Never mind.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.671
Jerome Watkins.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.343
Computer said
I failed that test.

11:26.552 --> 11:29.043
The computer made an error.

11:29.255 --> 11:33.089
I recommend this time, I pass.

11:33.659 --> 11:36.924
You're gonna do well, Jerome.
I can feel it.

11:40.499 --> 11:43.957
- Alan Eakian.
- Present, sir.

11:44.170 --> 11:47.139
Four brothers, two sisters,
all straight-A students.

11:47.339 --> 11:48.374
What are you doing here?

11:48.374 --> 11:48.806
What are you doing here?

11:49.008 --> 11:52.944
I assume there was some sort
of a baby mix-up at the hospital.

11:54.146 --> 11:56.080
- Rhonda Altobello.
- Here.

11:56.282 --> 11:58.773
You went from C's to F's.
What happened?

12:02.655 --> 12:04.088
Any other questions?

12:04.290 --> 12:06.087
No.

12:07.426 --> 12:10.122
- Denise Green.
- What's that file say about me?

12:10.329 --> 12:13.765
It's a lie. You wanna know about me,
ask me. What you want to know?

12:15.434 --> 12:18.028
- Where are my car keys?
- How would I know?

12:18.237 --> 12:20.705
What, does that thing say
I'm a thief too?

12:21.941 --> 12:24.535
All right, where are my car keys?

12:27.346 --> 12:30.110
- Chainsaw?
- Somewhere in this room.

12:30.316 --> 12:31.783
Right now you're very cold.

12:34.487 --> 12:36.921
- You're really cold.
- I want those keys.

12:37.123 --> 12:39.284
Oh, God, you're freezing.

12:39.925 --> 12:43.827
OK. OK, I'm a fun guy.
I'll play along.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.327
- Getting warmer.
- You are getting hot, man.

12:47.533 --> 12:49.865
- Oh, I see smoke.
- You are on fire!

12:50.069 --> 12:52.401
Oh, you're walking on the sun!
Ouch! Oh, wait.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.574
My mistake, I forgot where
I put them. You're ice-cold.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.003
Enough of this shit.

12:57.209 --> 12:59.200
Does that mean
we can swear in class?

12:59.411 --> 13:01.936
- Shit, yes!
- Hey, watch your fucking language!

13:02.148 --> 13:04.241
Watch your language, fart-face!

13:07.887 --> 13:10.788
- Where are my keys?
- There's the dick-brain that knows.

13:10.990 --> 13:13.788
If I knew anything,
would I be in this butt-hole class?

13:13.993 --> 13:15.620
Suck my loggerhead.

13:15.828 --> 13:17.159
Damn it!

13:17.363 --> 13:20.821
- Jizzum-head!
- Jizzum-head. Yeah, good one.

13:21.033 --> 13:22.330
One of my all-time faves.

13:23.869 --> 13:25.496
Psychology.

13:25.704 --> 13:29.162
You give a child the license
to swear, they lose all interest in it.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.639
- I certainly did.
- You're full of bull.

13:31.844 --> 13:34.312
It's OK, you can say "bullshit" in here.

13:34.513 --> 13:35.741
I'm grateful.

13:35.948 --> 13:38.439
I'm sure you're aware
that I'm teaching next door.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.778
And this swearing
is getting a little loud.

13:40.986 --> 13:44.615
You think you could concentrate on
some obscene gestures for a while?

13:45.524 --> 13:48.152
Yes! Yes, that's the idea.

13:49.295 --> 13:50.956
Thank you.

13:53.632 --> 13:55.031
I don't think she likes you.

14:01.373 --> 14:03.068
I want my car keys.

14:05.611 --> 14:08.045
I'm using the lavatory.

14:10.749 --> 14:14.549
- This is worse than a gas station.
- Yeah, I think I have to go too.

14:14.753 --> 14:18.018
Wait a minute. Hey, wait a...
My keys.

14:18.224 --> 14:20.158
Thattaboy, Mr. Shoop.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.589
Hey. Hey!

14:22.828 --> 14:27.162
OK, I'm calling roll
and then I'm gonna...

14:27.867 --> 14:29.095
Where's my roll sheet?

14:30.069 --> 14:32.401
It's somewhere in this room.

14:38.177 --> 14:41.772
Hey. Sorry about the noise.

14:41.981 --> 14:45.576
I'm really a gym teacher.
I don't belong in a classroom.

14:45.784 --> 14:48.218
Apology accepted.

14:49.188 --> 14:50.712
See you later.

14:50.923 --> 14:54.450
Let's start all over.
Hi, I'm Freddy Shoop.

14:54.660 --> 14:57.857
Look, you're a semi-charming guy
and a snappy dresser.

14:58.063 --> 15:01.624
- You're not the kind of guy I date.
- Yeah? What kind are you dating?

15:01.834 --> 15:04.803
- Oh, the kind who wears socks.
- I got a pair somewhere.

15:05.004 --> 15:07.632
White ones. So about dinner,

15:07.840 --> 15:10.900
you like Italian? Mexican?
Hey, maybe you'd rather cook.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.737
I'm not having dinner with you.

15:12.945 --> 15:14.276
- OK, lunch.
- Robin.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.048
Excuse me just one second.

15:17.249 --> 15:19.649
Robin, about tonight,
the concert starts at 8.

15:19.852 --> 15:22.286
I thought we'd go to the beach
and have a picnic.

15:22.488 --> 15:25.651
- Watch the sunset.
- Sounds wonderful.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.585
Oh, bye-bye, Freddy.

15:32.131 --> 15:35.464
I'll be darned.
You're a heterosexual.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.499
And a damned good one.

15:39.371 --> 15:42.101
- Good luck, honey.
- Thanks, Mom.

15:42.308 --> 15:44.538
OK, start her up.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.440
Make a right, please.

15:58.324 --> 15:59.552
These photos suck.

16:00.392 --> 16:02.986
Weddings, graduations.

16:03.929 --> 16:06.420
- Hoffman came in.
- Yeah.

16:06.632 --> 16:08.896
It's more of the redhead
with the tattoo.

16:09.101 --> 16:12.798
This time he's got her making
breakfast stark raving naked.

16:13.005 --> 16:14.632
Oh, Hoffman, you're so sick.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.171
Check out this composition.

16:16.375 --> 16:21.506
Round English muffin, square butter,
triangular bush. The man is an artist.

16:22.781 --> 16:24.612
- Reprints.
- Reprints.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.217
Hi, I'd like to sign
up for Lamaze classes.

16:27.419 --> 16:30.013
OK, how are Tuesday nights
for you and your coach?

16:30.222 --> 16:33.783
- Perfect, but I don't have a coach.
- Well, what about the father?

16:33.993 --> 16:37.952
Well, that's sort of confusing. It's either
David Lee Roth, who's on tour,

16:38.163 --> 16:40.996
or Sean Penn. And I'd really hate
to upset Madonna.

16:42.267 --> 16:43.996
Fill this out.

16:49.041 --> 16:51.373
OK. How far did we get yesterday?

16:51.577 --> 16:53.306
You took roll.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.106
Right. That shouldn't
take as long today.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.016
Pam.

17:03.422 --> 17:07.415
- Mr. Shoop, I gotta book.
- What? You just got here.

17:07.626 --> 17:08.991
Yeah.

17:09.762 --> 17:13.892
- It's a female thing.
- Oh, yeah, I understand.

17:15.134 --> 17:17.602
Oh, man, she's going surfing!

17:19.204 --> 17:21.763
I'm sure.

17:21.973 --> 17:25.603
Fuck. This menstruation deal,
it's such a scam.

17:25.810 --> 17:27.300
Girls are so lucky.

17:27.512 --> 17:29.777
What? Oh, we're so lucky?

17:29.982 --> 17:33.349
You think being on your period
is some picnic? Are you crazy?

17:33.552 --> 17:36.783
You get PMS, there's no room
in your purse for no hairbrush

17:36.989 --> 17:38.616
because you got these mini pads.

17:38.824 --> 17:40.052
You are so ignorant!

17:42.261 --> 17:44.491
This whole class
is jammed with ignorance.

17:44.696 --> 17:47.631
Yes, it is. Come in here, please.

17:47.833 --> 17:50.666
Mr. Shoop, this is our new
foreign exchange student,

17:50.869 --> 17:52.097
Anna-Maria Mazarelli.

17:52.304 --> 17:54.704
Anna-Maria is from Milan, Italy.

17:54.907 --> 17:59.367
She would like to brush up her English
skills before the fall semester begins.

18:00.379 --> 18:03.212
Well, I'll let you return
to your rigorous pursuit

18:03.415 --> 18:04.643
of academic excellence.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.078
Please.

18:06.452 --> 18:10.149
Anna-Maria, welcome to America.
You can sit wherever you want.

18:10.756 --> 18:11.984
You looking for a seat?

18:16.929 --> 18:19.159
Well, now, this desk
appears to be unoccupied.

18:19.398 --> 18:20.695
Grazie.

18:30.075 --> 18:33.067
OK, let's see what we got here.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.213
"Rules of grammar."

18:36.415 --> 18:38.576
"Writing paragraphs."

18:38.984 --> 18:41.077
God, I hate this stuff.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.220
"Book reports."

18:43.555 --> 18:45.648
Wanna get out of here?
Go to the library?

18:45.858 --> 18:47.086
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:48.227 --> 18:49.489
Let's go.

18:49.695 --> 18:51.595
I am Chainsaw.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.094
Hi, Chainsaw.

18:53.298 --> 18:54.666
- Hi, I'm Dave.
- Ciao.

18:54.666 --> 18:55.633
- Hi, I'm Dave.
- Ciao.

18:56.001 --> 18:57.559
- Well, we love Italy.
- Yeah.

18:57.769 --> 18:59.600
- The pizza.
- Mussolini.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.239
- And Tony Bennett.
- The Mafia.

19:02.441 --> 19:03.772
Yeah. Chef Boyardee.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.035
- Pinocchio.
- Fellatio.

19:06.245 --> 19:08.236
Oh, I don't like that.

19:08.447 --> 19:10.438
- Well, have you ever tried it?
- Sure.

19:10.649 --> 19:15.348
Chef Boyardee, spaghetti in a can.
It's so mushy.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.294
Anna-Maria?

19:23.495 --> 19:26.953
Have you seen the movie
Texas Chainsaw Massacre?

19:27.633 --> 19:30.033
No. It is good?

19:30.235 --> 19:33.204
Oh, I gotta tell you,
I love this film.

19:33.405 --> 19:35.930
It had passion and a plucky spirit.

19:36.141 --> 19:37.972
And the characters had integrity.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.112
Like when Leatherface went
on a strict diet of human flesh.

19:41.313 --> 19:44.146
- He had to cut out chicken and fish.
- I agree with you.

19:44.349 --> 19:48.308
I'll go a step further. Leatherface
wore a mask made out of human skin,

19:48.520 --> 19:51.080
he hung people on meat hooks,
but we've all got quirks.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.723
I've got them. You got them.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.416
That's what makes
this character so compelling.

19:55.627 --> 19:58.095
- Thumbs up from me.
- Same here.

19:58.297 --> 20:00.390
- To sum it up, I'm Chainsaw.
- I'm Dave.

20:00.599 --> 20:02.260
We'll see you at the movies.

20:04.036 --> 20:07.005
- OK.
- Let's go, people.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.833
I found them at Winchell's.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.236
Here, we all chipped in.

20:12.477 --> 20:14.843
Hey, jelly. I'm touched.

20:15.714 --> 20:18.615
This one was in the parking lot
with a surfboard.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.686
This is so humiliating.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.514
Pam.

20:25.524 --> 20:28.084
You know, I grew up
surfing those same waves.

20:28.293 --> 20:30.022
Today was phenom.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.824
Three to four, breaking out of the
south, glassy, light offshore breeze.

20:34.032 --> 20:35.363
Had to go for the ditch.

20:37.135 --> 20:38.932
Thanks.

20:39.137 --> 20:40.365
You're very spiritual.

20:43.809 --> 20:45.276
But the rest of you clowns...

20:45.477 --> 20:48.605
Hey, I gotta say something.
This whole thing is a joke.

20:48.814 --> 20:51.180
There's a very valid reason
for summer vacation.

20:51.383 --> 20:53.214
The human brain needs rest.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.818
Yeah. I mean,
what are we doing here?

20:56.021 --> 21:00.185
- Really. I don't wanna be here.
- Hey, look, this wasn't my idea.

21:00.993 --> 21:04.986
You guys aren't fired up about English.
I wouldn't know what to do if you were.

21:05.197 --> 21:08.860
But we're stuck here.
We're trapped like rats.

21:11.303 --> 21:13.362
Anybody got any ideas?

21:14.473 --> 21:17.135
Why don't we take some field trips?

21:17.442 --> 21:18.966
- Can we do that?
- Sure, yeah.

21:22.347 --> 21:24.781
I got permission slips right here.

21:30.455 --> 21:31.922
OK, take these home,

21:32.124 --> 21:35.184
have your mom or dad sign them,
I'll see what I can do.

21:35.394 --> 21:37.828
- Done.
- Same here.

21:41.500 --> 21:42.728
Good.

22:52.871 --> 22:54.839
The Screwdriver
was a disappointment.

22:55.040 --> 22:58.532
I was hoping for a headache
or pounding temples,

22:58.744 --> 23:00.837
a blackout, but, you know,
I feel fine.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.207
Actually, my headache is gone.
Thumbs down.

23:03.415 --> 23:06.475
I'm surprised. I found
the Screwdriver simply delightful.

23:06.685 --> 23:08.983
Fast corners.
That third loop was a surprise.

23:09.187 --> 23:11.087
The line moved fast.

23:12.657 --> 23:13.919
Is he OK?

23:14.126 --> 23:15.889
No, it appears
that he's vomiting.

23:17.829 --> 23:20.127
That's a sure sign
of a good ride. Thumbs up.

23:20.332 --> 23:22.357
Eakian, what did you eat?

23:52.664 --> 23:54.962
Don't be a pig. No.

24:01.573 --> 24:04.235
Hey! Hey, you slime.

24:04.509 --> 24:07.376
Stones' first farewell tour, '69.
Get out of here.

24:07.579 --> 24:10.514
- Oh, wait.
- He ripped my T-shirt.

24:10.715 --> 24:12.114
Oh, I can sew that.

24:12.317 --> 24:14.478
It's not necessary.
Go away!

24:14.686 --> 24:17.519
Nothing's necessary.
I want to.

24:18.089 --> 24:20.057
Great, I'll let you.

24:20.625 --> 24:24.925
Get them off! Get them off me!

24:27.299 --> 24:29.290
The bunnies from hell!

24:29.768 --> 24:31.668
Oh, God!

24:35.407 --> 24:36.635
Get away from me!

24:39.077 --> 24:41.136
Oh, dear!

24:53.525 --> 24:56.358
- Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
- Thank you very much.

24:56.561 --> 24:59.029
What is this? It's a lie.

25:01.666 --> 25:04.328
- We did this for you.
- How did you like it?

25:04.536 --> 25:06.265
It's disgusting!

25:07.772 --> 25:09.569
I love it.

25:11.009 --> 25:13.773
- What is that?
- Oh, it's foam latex.

25:14.679 --> 25:16.203
Keep it.

25:16.414 --> 25:18.405
You guys.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.621
Next field trip,
it's gotta be at the beach.

25:27.826 --> 25:30.954
We gotta see Anna-Maria
in a bikini. It's very important.

25:31.162 --> 25:32.595
I understand.

25:53.818 --> 25:55.376
Girl, this ain't the Riviera.

25:57.022 --> 25:58.512
Thank you.

26:00.559 --> 26:04.086
That was... That was...
That was cruel.

26:05.830 --> 26:07.161
You OK?

26:31.690 --> 26:33.715
Come in, come in, Mrs. Eakian.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.620
Now, how can I help you?

26:35.827 --> 26:38.762
Yesterday Alan came
home nauseous, sneezing,

26:38.964 --> 26:42.400
wheezing and itching,
with goat hairs on his clothes.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.068
He said he was at the museum,

26:44.269 --> 26:46.794
- but I found this in his pocket.
- Grandma...

26:47.305 --> 26:50.502
Is going on throw-up rides
and rubbing barnyard animals

26:50.709 --> 26:52.506
your idea of quality education?

26:52.711 --> 26:54.201
- Grandma...
- Certainly not.

26:54.412 --> 26:56.573
We'll talk to Mr. Shoop
about this right now.

26:57.082 --> 26:58.743
I may have used poor judgment.

26:58.950 --> 27:01.180
You actually used judgment.

27:01.386 --> 27:04.549
Do you realize if anything happened
to these kids, the lawsuits?

27:04.756 --> 27:06.917
You could've bankrupt
the entire district!

27:07.125 --> 27:09.787
And mess up your chance
at election to state assembly?

27:09.995 --> 27:13.431
- Yes.
- Don't wet your pants. Watch this.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.692
All you had to do was
babysit some social deviants.

27:16.901 --> 27:18.493
Those deviants are great kids.

27:18.703 --> 27:21.194
I'm sure they'll grow up
to be wonderful criminals.

27:21.406 --> 27:24.842
- They're as smart as you and me.
- You and I.

27:25.043 --> 27:26.305
All of us.

27:28.480 --> 27:31.472
You're suspended until Kelban
returns and fires you.

27:31.683 --> 27:32.980
What?

27:33.184 --> 27:36.676
Hey, this is your fault.
You knew I couldn't teach.

27:36.888 --> 27:38.685
Goodbye, Mr. Shoop.

27:49.267 --> 27:54.398
Gills, what if I become
a model teacher?

28:00.078 --> 28:03.445
This is gonna be fun. OK.

28:03.648 --> 28:06.811
You get every kid left in your class
to pass that skills test

28:07.018 --> 28:09.179
and I'll forget
about your field trips.

28:09.387 --> 28:11.150
Done.

28:13.758 --> 28:16.124
- They all have to pass?
- It's called teaching.

28:16.327 --> 28:17.954
If you don't know how to do that,

28:18.163 --> 28:21.564
then I guess you don't
deserve tenure. Do you?

28:24.002 --> 28:25.435
I'll teach.

28:32.043 --> 28:33.943
Morning, class.

28:35.380 --> 28:36.608
Nice tie!

28:38.316 --> 28:39.647
Oh, baby.

28:39.851 --> 28:43.343
Mr. Shoop, what's with the
threads, man? You getting married?

28:43.555 --> 28:46.023
No, must be laundry day.
Nothing else was clean.

28:46.224 --> 28:47.555
- Funeral?
- Could we come?

28:47.759 --> 28:49.659
Please take your seats.

28:49.961 --> 28:52.896
- Where should we take them?
- Sit down, Francis.

28:57.969 --> 29:01.405
From this moment forth, you people
eat English, sleep English.

29:01.606 --> 29:03.335
You are English.

29:03.541 --> 29:05.372
Oh, then pass the crumpets, old boy.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.135
I'm not kidding around.

29:07.345 --> 29:10.837
Anyone not interested in passing
that exam can leave right now.

29:16.988 --> 29:18.353
The guy's been pretty cool.

29:18.556 --> 29:22.925
He called me Francis.
Hasta luego, Placido Domingo.

29:23.128 --> 29:25.653
Chainsaw, Dave, wait a minute.

29:26.765 --> 29:31.099
Look, Gills is having a cow
about our field trips.

29:31.302 --> 29:35.671
Unless you guys all pass
that test, my job? Memorex.

29:36.241 --> 29:37.765
Anybody got any ideas here?

29:37.976 --> 29:39.341
Get yourself some want ads.

29:39.544 --> 29:42.570
I don't care what your files say.
You are not that dumb.

29:42.781 --> 29:46.615
Actually, Mr. Shoop, those files
are usually right on the money.

29:46.818 --> 29:48.581
- You all feel that way?
- I do.

29:49.854 --> 29:52.414
- I may as well go home.
- Mr. Shoop?

29:52.624 --> 29:55.718
Look, we don't want
you to lose your job.

29:56.761 --> 29:58.285
Think about what you're asking.

29:58.496 --> 30:01.590
- You want us to study?
- The thought did cross my mind.

30:01.800 --> 30:04.394
- Well, what's in it for us?
- Literacy.

30:05.336 --> 30:06.928
Oh, sorry, that's...

30:09.207 --> 30:12.734
- I'd like to help. What can I do?
- Give me your car.

30:12.944 --> 30:14.411
- Your house.
- And your dog.

30:14.612 --> 30:18.013
- See you.
- Wait, wait! Mr. Shoop, wait!

30:18.216 --> 30:19.649
There's room to negotiate.

30:20.418 --> 30:22.886
What if you granted
each one of us one wish?

30:25.890 --> 30:27.858
What do you mean, "wish"?

30:28.059 --> 30:29.617
You know, like a favor.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.386
Does anybody need anything?

30:31.596 --> 30:34.895
I need somebody to work out with,
in case I get back on the team.

30:35.099 --> 30:38.660
- I could use a Lamaze coach.
- I need some driving lessons. Bad.

30:40.405 --> 30:44.671
OK, there's two of us.
Therefore, we get two.

30:44.876 --> 30:48.869
All right. One, a party, your house,
Fourth of July weekend.

30:49.080 --> 30:50.570
In Anna-Maria's honor.

30:50.782 --> 30:53.842
Number two, you arrange
a screening, in class,

30:54.052 --> 30:55.610
of the greatest movie ever made.

30:55.820 --> 31:00.655
The 1973 Tobe Hooper classic
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.521
- That is also in Anna-Maria's honor.
- Thank you.

31:03.728 --> 31:06.094
Now, then, is there
anything that you desire?

31:06.297 --> 31:09.698
Oh, I don't deserve a wish.
I don't take the test anyway.

31:09.901 --> 31:12.699
God, she is so honest.
We'll take hers.

31:13.538 --> 31:18.066
Chauffeur service for Dave and I,
every day, to and from work.

31:18.810 --> 31:20.778
Pam, what's your wish?

31:22.146 --> 31:25.343
I'll tell Mr. Shoop
when the time is right.

31:29.921 --> 31:31.616
Larry?

31:31.823 --> 31:36.487
- Larry, what do you want?
- Bed.

31:37.195 --> 31:39.322
He wants a bed.

31:39.530 --> 31:43.626
As for myself, I just wanna be
invited to the party.

31:45.203 --> 31:47.671
- We'll see.
- Good enough.

31:47.872 --> 31:50.568
I think these are fair
and reasonable requests.

31:50.775 --> 31:55.041
In return, we'll show up,
we'll pay attention

31:55.246 --> 31:57.578
and we'll even do a little homework.

31:58.750 --> 32:01.446
- Is this contract acceptable to labor?
- No doubt.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.883
- Yeah.
- Does management agree?

32:04.088 --> 32:08.149
- You sure I'm management?
- For our purposes here, yes.

32:09.427 --> 32:12.260
Do we have a binding agreement?

32:13.464 --> 32:15.932
We got something.

32:16.134 --> 32:19.297
All right. Well, we put
that baby to bed.

32:20.305 --> 32:24.765
Let's do lunch.
I always wanted to say that.

32:25.610 --> 32:30.013
- Well, go ahead. Teach.
- Right.

32:30.581 --> 32:32.549
Teach.

32:34.485 --> 32:35.782
Don't anybody move.

32:36.154 --> 32:38.213
- The Non-Proliferation Treaty.
- Beagman?

32:38.423 --> 32:41.187
- Excuse me, Miss Bishop.
- Mr. Shoop.

32:41.392 --> 32:45.328
Shouldn't you be planning
a field trip to 7-Eleven?

32:45.530 --> 32:47.828
I need your help.
I know how you feel about me,

32:48.032 --> 32:50.660
but something really bizarre
has happened to my kids.

32:50.868 --> 32:51.970
- Please.
- All right.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.403
- Please.
- All right.

32:53.604 --> 32:57.597
If I get next door and there's a
candlelight dinner, I'm calling security.

32:57.809 --> 33:00.573
- Continue.
- The 1970 Seabed Treaty.

33:00.778 --> 33:02.006
Do you own that suit?

33:08.086 --> 33:12.022
- What did you do, pass out Valiums?
- This is a natural lull.

33:12.223 --> 33:16.523
Interesting phenomenon.
What do you want from me?

33:16.728 --> 33:19.629
How do you teach?

33:19.831 --> 33:24.325
- If you're serious, I'll help you.
- Great.

33:24.535 --> 33:27.800
Meet me after school.
We'll make plans for the weekend.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.831
For the weekend?

33:31.943 --> 33:35.037
Big guy. OK.

33:41.152 --> 33:43.620
The easiest thing to do
is base your lesson plans

33:43.821 --> 33:46.722
on the students' own experiences.

33:46.924 --> 33:50.291
- I can do that.
- Your life is probably very similar.

33:50.495 --> 33:54.158
Hardly. I'm telling you,
you gotta try these Pop-Tarts.

33:54.365 --> 33:56.026
No, thanks.

33:56.234 --> 33:58.828
I'm sticking with the Chocodiles.

33:59.037 --> 34:02.666
The best teachers are the teachers
who entertain while they teach.

34:02.874 --> 34:06.105
- So you should do just fine.
- You think I'm entertaining?

34:07.412 --> 34:09.243
To children.

34:09.447 --> 34:12.280
- I gotta go. Time's up.
- I know why you're helping me.

34:12.483 --> 34:15.452
- Professional courtesy.
- No. You like me.

34:15.652 --> 34:18.349
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.217
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

34:20.425 --> 34:21.687
- Do not.
- Do too.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.451
- Don't either.
- Come on.

34:23.661 --> 34:25.856
- Don't you like me just a little bit?
- No.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.259
Not even that much?

34:28.466 --> 34:30.991
I like you that much.

34:34.438 --> 34:36.703
It's a start.

34:40.011 --> 34:43.708
Now, someone tell me why
learning how to write is so critical.

34:43.915 --> 34:50.252
- It's a form of communication.
- Amen. And it can get you free stuff.

34:50.455 --> 34:54.585
- Free?
- Free. I'm writing the word...

34:54.792 --> 34:59.126
...free. Here's how it works.
All of us have been ripped off, right?

34:59.330 --> 35:02.094
Pay phone steals money,
not enough cheese on your pizza.

35:02.300 --> 35:04.734
- My shades keep falling apart.
- Perfect.

35:04.936 --> 35:06.631
You're gonna write that company.

35:06.838 --> 35:09.534
You'll see action,
if your letter is clearly written

35:09.740 --> 35:11.571
and threatens to hurt their business.

35:11.776 --> 35:13.937
And is signed, forgive me, Chainsaw,

35:14.445 --> 35:18.472
"Mr. Francis Gremp, president,
Consumer Against Faulty Eyewear."

35:18.683 --> 35:21.481
You want me to lie? OK.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.818
Anyone interested
in learning the correct form,

35:25.022 --> 35:28.116
please turn to page 46
in your textbook.

35:31.229 --> 35:32.526
The shit works.

35:35.333 --> 35:37.130
Damn!

35:37.335 --> 35:39.530
Stupid son of a...

35:39.737 --> 35:44.800
- I'm not cut out to be a linebacker.
- No, you're looking at my shoulders.

35:45.009 --> 35:49.946
Don't. Focus on my waist.
OK? My waist.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.548
All right, try it again. Go on.

35:52.750 --> 35:57.312
That's good.
Remember, I'm your teacher.

36:03.528 --> 36:05.359
You wanna learn how to surf?

36:09.100 --> 36:11.330
- You sure you wanna do this?
- Absolutely.

36:11.536 --> 36:14.767
Lamaze class,
great place to meet girls.

36:24.849 --> 36:27.875
OK, Denise, slide over.

36:28.219 --> 36:30.653
Oh, no, no, no.

36:30.855 --> 36:32.948
Is this some kind of sick, twisted joke?

36:33.157 --> 36:36.649
No, I'm combining Denise's driving
lesson with your ride to the beach.

36:36.861 --> 36:39.591
We took driver training
with Denise. Call us a cab.

36:39.797 --> 36:41.594
Get your grisly butts in the car.

36:41.799 --> 36:44.734
Man, let me drive.
I'm going for my license next week.

36:46.404 --> 36:49.498
- Chainsaw, you've been drinking.
- No, it's cough medicine.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.267
Check out this phlegm.

36:52.476 --> 36:55.104
Save the phlegm.
You're not driving anywhere.

36:55.313 --> 36:59.215
I'll tell you something. You know why
so many drunk drivers get in wrecks?

36:59.417 --> 37:03.478
- They don't learn to drive drunk.
- Fact: Alcohol kills brain cells.

37:03.688 --> 37:07.715
You lose one more, you're
a talking monkey. Come on, get in.

37:07.925 --> 37:09.916
Come on.

37:13.297 --> 37:14.696
OK, Denise, start her up.

37:17.969 --> 37:20.995
Signal left. Pull on out.

37:24.008 --> 37:27.068
Can I call my folks
and say I won't be home... ever?

37:27.278 --> 37:28.802
I'm not used to this car.

37:39.023 --> 37:41.389
I think it's safe.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.389
Move it out.

37:43.594 --> 37:46.927
Nice and smooth. Oh, yeah, that's...

37:47.131 --> 37:49.793
Fine. Good.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.440
- Why did you do that?
- A car was coming.

38:04.382 --> 38:07.044
Well, it'll happen from time to time.

38:07.251 --> 38:09.185
Come on, Denise,
he won't bother us.

38:14.058 --> 38:17.152
We just got lapped
by an old lady with a walker.

38:17.595 --> 38:19.756
- See that space between those cars?
- Yeah.

38:19.964 --> 38:22.694
- Pull in.
- Parallel park? That's my weak spot.

38:22.900 --> 38:25.198
Listen to her.

38:25.536 --> 38:27.504
OK.

38:37.248 --> 38:39.546
- I'm sober now.
- That's good for today.

38:39.750 --> 38:40.978
- We live!
- We live!

38:46.057 --> 38:47.581
It's beautiful.

38:47.792 --> 38:50.659
Enough safe and sane.
It's time for dumb and dangerous.

38:50.861 --> 38:54.490
These are Mexican. You do not
know what's in these babies.

38:57.134 --> 38:59.261
Hey, get me a brew.

39:07.511 --> 39:09.672
Coming through.

39:10.481 --> 39:13.882
Anna-Maria, as far as we know,
this has never, ever been attempted.

39:14.085 --> 39:19.022
Anna-Maria, we dedicate
these cantaloupe to you.

39:19.690 --> 39:22.921
You make fruit bombs for me?
Oh, how sweet.

39:23.127 --> 39:28.030
- Melon balls, coming up!
- We're gonna make these babies fly!

39:38.476 --> 39:40.637
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

39:40.845 --> 39:42.312
You're awake. I wanna talk.

39:42.513 --> 39:45.209
- Not now, babe, I'm late.
- Late for what?

39:51.155 --> 39:53.282
What's it like being pregnant?

39:53.491 --> 39:56.460
- Bizarre.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

39:57.328 --> 40:01.628
My body is out of control
and it's big and ugly.

40:01.832 --> 40:05.529
- I think you look great.
- Sure, in the dark.

40:08.606 --> 40:10.699
How much longer?

40:13.277 --> 40:15.040
About five weeks.

40:15.679 --> 40:19.274
- It's gonna be amazing.
- Yeah, I know.

40:19.483 --> 40:21.849
You'll be a mother.

40:22.820 --> 40:24.048
Yeah.

40:24.255 --> 40:27.383
Eakian, this party's getting weak.

40:27.591 --> 40:29.582
Do something wild.
Take all your clothes off.

40:29.794 --> 40:32.661
Why? You want everyone
to go home?

40:35.733 --> 40:38.167
You're almost fun tonight.

40:43.774 --> 40:45.935
Almost.

40:49.513 --> 40:52.107
- You all right?
- Yeah. Come on in.

40:52.316 --> 40:54.750
I'm just resting up. Too much fun.

40:54.952 --> 40:56.977
It's all sewn.

40:57.188 --> 40:59.816
Hey, thanks. That's great.

41:02.660 --> 41:08.098
- I feel so at home here.
- Yeah, me too.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.426
Yeah.

41:12.136 --> 41:14.969
The grunion are running tonight.

41:15.739 --> 41:20.301
In the dead of night,
under a full moon,

41:20.511 --> 41:24.277
thousands of horny little fish
swim hundreds of miles

41:24.482 --> 41:27.042
to ball their brains out in the sand.

41:27.251 --> 41:28.650
It's so romantic.

41:32.723 --> 41:34.953
You ever do that
with one of your students?

41:36.193 --> 41:40.687
No. I swim hundreds of miles,
I'm ready for a nap.

41:43.033 --> 41:44.864
Who's that?

41:45.069 --> 41:49.836
Oh, it's Kim.
She's sort of my girlfriend.

41:50.808 --> 41:54.300
- "Sort of"?
- Well, she's in Hawaii.

41:56.347 --> 42:00.716
So you're all alone
and you like young girls.

42:01.652 --> 42:03.882
Kim's not that young. She's 21.

42:04.455 --> 42:07.754
I'm 16. And you should
consider that.

42:07.958 --> 42:11.689
Because there's, like, no difference
between 21 and 16 now,

42:11.896 --> 42:17.334
but when she's 66,
I'll only be 61.

42:18.068 --> 42:21.504
And I'll be 75
and it won't matter anyway.

42:25.476 --> 42:27.103
Yeah.

42:40.224 --> 42:43.455
Come on, Pam. Time for more fun.

42:44.461 --> 42:46.554
Wondermutt!

42:56.807 --> 42:58.468
Out of my way!

42:58.676 --> 43:02.737
Watch your ass, folks! Banzai!

43:16.860 --> 43:19.829
- Oh, shit.
- Fire!

43:24.168 --> 43:25.965
Do something!

43:29.707 --> 43:32.904
- Jesus Christ, my couch is on fire!
- Come on, Dave.

43:33.110 --> 43:34.941
What? What? What?

43:47.791 --> 43:50.885
- All right, we took care of it.
- My fish!

43:51.095 --> 43:53.029
- How many were there?
- One.

43:54.999 --> 43:56.489
Poor fishy.

43:57.801 --> 44:00.497
Get rid of that couch.
That is a definite fire hazard.

44:00.704 --> 44:02.535
- Definitely.
- Party's over.

44:02.740 --> 44:04.799
It was just getting good.
We got a fire...

44:05.009 --> 44:06.636
Good night!

44:07.277 --> 44:08.972
One little fire.

44:09.813 --> 44:11.872
Big deal.

44:20.057 --> 44:23.754
- Minors drinking on the beach.
- Seriously, we never do this.

44:23.961 --> 44:28.364
Boy, never, ever. There's our
English teacher, let's ask him.

44:28.565 --> 44:32.001
Mr. Shoop, sir, could you come here
just a moment, please?

44:32.202 --> 44:33.863
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

44:34.071 --> 44:36.733
- What's up?
- Found these boys with alcohol.

44:37.241 --> 44:41.177
That alcohol, officer?
Oh, that's not theirs.

44:42.012 --> 44:43.741
Whose is it?

44:46.073 --> 44:49.440
It's mine. See, I live
in that house right there

44:49.644 --> 44:52.272
and they were just
watching my stuff.

44:52.480 --> 44:54.038
That's right. It's his.

44:54.248 --> 44:57.809
We should never have taken those
little baby sips. That was wrong.

44:58.019 --> 45:00.453
God, so very, very wrong.

45:00.655 --> 45:03.852
I think they learned
one hell of a lesson, officer.

45:04.058 --> 45:07.687
Next time you boys encounter alcohol,
remember you're underage.

45:08.396 --> 45:10.762
- Yes, sir, we will.
- Yeah, of course, thank...

45:10.965 --> 45:12.762
Thank you.

45:12.967 --> 45:16.164
- Well, we're off to do our homework.
- Yeah. Thank you. Bye.

45:16.370 --> 45:18.861
- We shouldn't have tried this.
- It was a mistake.

45:19.073 --> 45:22.201
That was bad.
We should've just said no.

45:23.544 --> 45:25.341
- You guys are good men.
- Thank you.

45:25.546 --> 45:26.911
Thank you.

45:28.149 --> 45:31.880
You're under arrest for contributing
to the delinquency of a minor.

45:32.286 --> 45:35.551
- Officer, that's not really my vodka.
- Is that your dog?

45:36.457 --> 45:39.290
- Yeah.
- No dogs on the beach, $50 fine.

45:39.493 --> 45:42.018
He's not really my dog.
He just thinks he's my dog.

45:42.229 --> 45:43.753
No, he's a neighborhood dog.

45:43.965 --> 45:46.866
He hangs out at my place
because there's garbage there.

45:47.068 --> 45:50.094
He's a scavenger. He'll eat anything.
He's a beach dog, really.

45:50.304 --> 45:51.669
Go away, beach dog.

45:54.809 --> 45:56.834
Do you have a cell for beginners?

46:00.615 --> 46:04.073
- Boogie boy.
- Bunk in here.

46:04.819 --> 46:08.255
- Moondoggie.
- Yeah.

46:09.423 --> 46:10.651
Who wants gum?

46:13.227 --> 46:15.195
Leave your message
after the beep.

46:15.630 --> 46:18.292
Robin, it's your pal, Shoop.

46:18.499 --> 46:21.229
I can't leave my number
because I'm downtown in jail.

46:21.435 --> 46:23.130
- Jail?
- What, you're surprised?

46:23.337 --> 46:28.104
I got arrested in my swim trunks, so
I need 50 bucks and a pair of shoes.

46:28.309 --> 46:31.608
Listen, please don't mention
this to that bite in the ass Gills.

46:31.812 --> 46:34.144
You're an angel.
Dinner, dancing, Paris...

46:34.348 --> 46:35.872
Hello, Mr. Shoop.

46:36.083 --> 46:37.880
- Who is this?
- The bite in the ass.

46:39.286 --> 46:43.985
When I say "bite in the ass", I mean
that in the nicest possible way.

46:44.191 --> 46:45.522
Can I talk to Robin?

46:45.893 --> 46:49.727
I'm afraid Robin and I
are on our way out of town.

46:49.930 --> 46:52.490
But don't worry, we'll be right over.

46:53.434 --> 46:55.800
He's still a human being, Phillip.

46:56.003 --> 46:58.369
We have a very long drive.
If we go downtown now,

46:58.572 --> 46:59.840
we'll be stuck in traffic.
And that's OK with me,

46:59.840 --> 47:01.307
we'll be stuck in traffic.
And that's OK with me,

47:01.509 --> 47:06.640
because we'll be helping Shoop
and you won't think I'm a shit. Right?

47:08.983 --> 47:10.974
Am I in really big trouble?

47:11.185 --> 47:13.915
Arrested for contributing
to the delinquency of minors?

47:14.121 --> 47:16.316
You're not a hero.

47:16.524 --> 47:18.389
What is this?

47:18.592 --> 47:20.184
I made a new friend.

47:20.761 --> 47:25.391
Mr. Shoop, I do hope we can get you
out of this ugly mess. And it is ugly.

47:25.599 --> 47:28.762
Mr. Shoop's been making
a lot of progress in his class, Phillip.

47:28.969 --> 47:32.461
It's true. I've been handing out
assignments and the kids turn them in.

47:32.673 --> 47:35.972
- It's almost like school in there.
- I've heard. And I'm proud.

47:36.177 --> 47:39.169
Confirms all my instincts
about him. He's my boy.

47:40.514 --> 47:43.711
Robin, let's get out of here.

47:43.918 --> 47:46.182
We're on our way to wine country.

47:46.387 --> 47:50.346
You kids have fun.

48:01.168 --> 48:03.193
See those waves, Wondermutt?

48:04.138 --> 48:06.538
They're from Hawaii.

48:06.741 --> 48:09.369
Kim's in Hawaii.

48:10.377 --> 48:13.244
Robin's in the wine country.

48:15.116 --> 48:18.882
You know what we need?
I mean, besides bread.

48:19.754 --> 48:23.315
We need a woman
who will appreciate

48:23.524 --> 48:25.685
what we have to offer.

48:25.893 --> 48:28.157
A woman of culture...

48:29.196 --> 48:30.493
...intellect.

48:30.831 --> 48:33.800
Shake those buns, baby!

48:39.340 --> 48:44.073
Bring those buns over here. Mama's
got some software for you, baby.

48:47.314 --> 48:50.306
Excuse me.
I'm with Playgirl magazine.

48:50.684 --> 48:53.653
Survey me later, I'm trying
to concentrate. Come on, baby.

48:53.888 --> 48:56.083
Thanks for your time.

49:01.128 --> 49:03.153
Shoot them buns over here.

49:10.471 --> 49:12.029
Hey!

49:15.810 --> 49:18.335
Hey, cowboy! Don't I know you?

49:18.546 --> 49:21.811
Hey, back off, hair-bag,
this is ladies' night.

49:24.385 --> 49:26.444
I love him, I love him, I love him.

49:26.654 --> 49:28.019
Larry!

49:28.956 --> 49:31.390
Mr. Shoop. What are you doing here?

49:31.592 --> 49:34.459
What am I doing here?
You do this every night?

49:34.662 --> 49:36.596
Well, we have Mondays off.

49:36.797 --> 49:39.823
Listen, man, you can't tell
anybody, OK? They think I'm 21.

49:40.034 --> 49:44.664
You were fabulous.
This is from both of us.

49:44.872 --> 49:47.102
I'm in the wrong business.
But about school,

49:47.308 --> 49:50.709
if you could sneak in a couple
hours' sleep, you'd catch up.

49:50.911 --> 49:53.277
Mr. Shoop, man,
think about what you're saying.

49:53.480 --> 49:55.107
I mean, if you could be 17 again,

49:55.316 --> 49:58.012
only you knew then
what you know now.

49:58.219 --> 50:01.347
- Yeah.
- Well, I know.

50:03.924 --> 50:05.687
I hate that kid.

50:06.427 --> 50:11.626
"Who we admire most
in the world and why.

50:11.832 --> 50:15.097
"The person we admire most
in the world is makeup artist

50:15.302 --> 50:17.202
"and creature creator Rick Baker."

50:17.404 --> 50:20.305
"His wonderfully gruesome slime
bladders and slobber tubes

50:20.507 --> 50:25.240
"in American Werewolf in London
won him a richly deserved Oscar.

50:25.446 --> 50:29.940
"That is why we admire makeup artist
and creature creator Rick Baker

50:30.150 --> 50:32.710
"very, very, very,
very, very, very..."

50:32.920 --> 50:35.013
"Very, very, very, very, very..."

50:35.222 --> 50:38.919
"Very, very, very, very, very,
very, very, very, very, very..."

50:39.126 --> 50:42.220
"Very, very, very, very, very much."

50:42.429 --> 50:45.455
- It's 100 words on the nose.
- You can count if you want.

50:45.666 --> 50:48.533
"It is not easy to pick
the person I admire most.

50:48.736 --> 50:50.761
"I admire people
for different reasons.

50:50.971 --> 50:55.874
"The way they surf or teach English
from the heart or help the homeless.

50:56.076 --> 50:59.011
"To pick one person
is so unfair to everyone else.

50:59.213 --> 51:01.579
"Isn't there enough pain
in the world?"

51:01.782 --> 51:05.741
Since there's no one I admire most,
this is about a person I admire least,

51:05.953 --> 51:08.285
my ex-boyfriend, Andre.

51:08.489 --> 51:10.889
If he tells you he broke up
with me, he's lying,

51:11.091 --> 51:13.559
because I told him
to get out of my face first.

51:13.761 --> 51:16.787
You know how I could tell
when he's lying? His lips move.

51:16.997 --> 51:20.694
I'm serious. He's so in love with
himself, he ought to be dating a mirror.

51:20.901 --> 51:22.528
He's in skin-tight leather pants,

51:22.736 --> 51:26.467
thinking he's Rick James' little brother.
Give the world a break.

51:26.874 --> 51:29.741
- Denise, can I have your paper?
- No.

51:31.445 --> 51:34.414
- No?
- Well, I had to memorize my essay

51:34.615 --> 51:36.446
due to the fact
I was mugged by a gang

51:36.650 --> 51:38.481
looking for money and homework.

51:39.520 --> 51:40.748
That happens.

51:43.090 --> 51:47.652
OK, gang, mark your calendars.
Field trip next Monday.

51:47.861 --> 51:49.920
Where are we going, cockfights?

51:50.798 --> 51:52.857
Courthouse.

51:53.067 --> 51:57.834
Your teacher was arrested
for giving vodka to some kids.

51:59.173 --> 52:01.664
You and Dave won't want to miss it.

52:01.875 --> 52:04.969
- You went to jail for us?
- On roller skates.

52:05.179 --> 52:07.374
Thanks, man.

52:27.101 --> 52:29.035
Pam?

52:29.236 --> 52:31.204
Hi.

52:33.540 --> 52:34.871
What are you doing here?

52:35.075 --> 52:38.841
Remember I said I'd tell you my wish
when the time was right? It's right.

52:40.080 --> 52:43.880
- Your wish is to move in with me?
- I'm a great cook.

52:49.390 --> 52:51.688
I won't get in your way.

52:51.892 --> 52:54.827
You know we connect.

52:55.029 --> 52:58.931
- Pam, look, my place is very small.
- It's perfect.

52:59.967 --> 53:03.198
Look, Tommy, that's my brother,
he had another kid

53:03.404 --> 53:07.363
and Angela, she's his wife, wants to
move the twins back into Gail's room

53:07.574 --> 53:10.168
and put Sally in the den,
so I lose the couch.

53:10.377 --> 53:14.074
- Yeah, well, my couch is barbecued.
- The floor is fine.

53:14.281 --> 53:17.842
Mr. Shoop, everybody else
got their wish.

53:23.190 --> 53:26.216
OK, Pam.

53:26.427 --> 53:28.418
If I let you stay here,

53:28.629 --> 53:31.757
it's only temporary
until you find another place, OK?

53:34.201 --> 53:36.294
I can stay.

53:36.503 --> 53:38.596
Who are you talking to?

53:39.206 --> 53:42.403
This is Tommy and Angela
and Gail and Sally and Sly

53:42.609 --> 53:46.101
and the twins, Chuck and Bob,
and Tommy, Jr.

53:46.313 --> 53:47.541
This is Mr. Shoop.

53:47.748 --> 53:49.511
- How are you?
- Pleased to meet you.

53:53.353 --> 53:56.288
She screams so well.

53:57.491 --> 53:59.982
Oh, don't be a wuss.

54:00.194 --> 54:02.128
Shut up!

54:02.329 --> 54:04.024
Run, run.

54:04.231 --> 54:06.791
Larry! Larry, wake up,
you're missing this.

54:07.000 --> 54:10.265
Larry's not missing a thing.
Let him sleep.

54:10.471 --> 54:13.133
- There he is.
- Leatherface, Leatherface.

54:14.341 --> 54:16.332
Oh, no.

54:18.112 --> 54:21.275
That's not a real person.
It's a stuntman.

54:21.782 --> 54:25.047
OK, now, this... This right here
isn't gonna bother him,

54:25.252 --> 54:28.050
because he's insane, OK?

54:33.427 --> 54:35.224
Good Lord.

54:35.429 --> 54:37.397
- What are you watching?
- Do the dance.

54:37.598 --> 54:40.590
A new film from the district,
Safe Use of Power Tools.

54:40.801 --> 54:43.326
Delivery. I don't want
to know what this is, do I?

54:43.537 --> 54:45.835
No, probably not.

54:46.073 --> 54:47.870
Come on.

54:48.075 --> 54:50.805
- What a finish, ladies and gentlemen.
- It was great.

54:51.011 --> 54:52.535
What did you think of that?

54:52.746 --> 54:55.544
- God, it was really American.
- American, yes.

54:55.749 --> 54:59.310
It's an American masterpiece.

54:59.520 --> 55:02.580
Talk about gutsy endings.
The girl gets away

55:02.789 --> 55:05.053
and our hero, Leatherface,
chainsaws his legs.

55:05.259 --> 55:07.523
- Two thumbs up.
- Make that four for gore.

55:07.728 --> 55:09.923
Listen up, I wanna
read you something:

55:10.130 --> 55:13.190
"Dear Mr. Francis Gremp,
thank you for informing us

55:13.400 --> 55:15.925
"of your problem with our
Cool Dude sunglasses."

55:16.603 --> 55:17.831
It worked.

55:18.038 --> 55:20.802
"Please accept these
Cool Dudes with our compliments."

55:21.008 --> 55:24.068
All right, it's Christmastime.
Free glasses.

55:24.278 --> 55:25.711
- Are these free?
- Yes.

55:25.913 --> 55:28.006
"We know you'll find them
well-constructed

55:28.215 --> 55:32.083
"and we hope your organization
will see no need to boycott.

55:32.286 --> 55:36.313
"Sincerely, Wayne Appleton,
president, Cool Dude, Inc."

55:36.523 --> 55:40.050
- All right, the power of the pen.
- Hey, thanks, Chainsaw.

55:40.260 --> 55:44.321
Hey, Eakian. Eakian. Man, you think
you can help me with my letter,

55:44.531 --> 55:45.930
make it sound official?

55:46.133 --> 55:48.499
Sure, Denise.

55:49.236 --> 55:51.761
You wanna give it to me?

55:57.945 --> 55:59.378
OK, tonight, for homework,

55:59.580 --> 56:03.107
write a review of
Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

56:05.052 --> 56:06.986
Rhonda?

56:08.622 --> 56:12.581
If you're not doing anything tomorrow,
I thought we could do something.

56:12.793 --> 56:15.626
Oh, I have Lamaze class
tomorrow night.

56:15.829 --> 56:19.993
- Do you wanna go with me?
- What about Mr. Shoop?

56:20.200 --> 56:23.761
Oh, he won't care. I mean,
if you don't mind being my coach.

56:24.504 --> 56:28.167
- I wouldn't mind at all.
- Great.

56:28.375 --> 56:30.502
Great.

56:31.345 --> 56:33.279
See you, Eak.

56:34.214 --> 56:36.148
Mr. Shoop...

56:37.784 --> 56:43.689
...you should see this, but you can't
let Denise know I showed you. OK?

56:43.890 --> 56:45.585
OK.

56:55.869 --> 56:58.360
Shoop, this girl's dyslexic.

56:58.572 --> 57:00.506
What? That's not in her file.

57:00.707 --> 57:03.540
This is serious.
You gotta get her some help.

57:04.745 --> 57:07.236
How could she get this far
with no one finding out?

57:07.648 --> 57:09.639
She slipped through the system.

57:09.850 --> 57:12.444
What happens when
she gets out in the real world?

57:12.653 --> 57:17.113
Wait! Is this the same guy that took
his English class to the petting zoo?

57:17.324 --> 57:20.851
- How'd you get those kids to work?
- Bribed them.

57:23.263 --> 57:25.356
What would it take to have dinner
with you?

57:25.565 --> 57:27.362
That would be very expensive.

57:33.573 --> 57:37.202
- I'm having dinner with Gills.
- Big Phil again, huh?

57:37.411 --> 57:39.641
Robin, be honest,
isn't he a bite in the ass?

57:39.846 --> 57:44.010
No, he's not a bite in the ass.
He happens to be very...

57:46.920 --> 57:51.254
...articulate... cultured...

57:51.458 --> 57:54.188
...extraordinarily tidy.

57:54.394 --> 57:57.227
Tall, dark and tidy.
That's a magic combination.

57:58.965 --> 58:01.229
- You're not in love.
- None of your business.

58:01.435 --> 58:02.663
- Sure, it is.
- No.

58:02.869 --> 58:05.167
Tell me you love him,
I'll stop asking you out.

58:05.605 --> 58:08.438
How am I gonna tell you
I love him when it's so new?

58:08.642 --> 58:12.203
I knew it. See, Robin,
he is not the guy for you.

58:12.612 --> 58:16.173
You need an intelligent,
sensitive man who can skate.

58:16.383 --> 58:20.649
- Do you know such a guy?
- Oh, they're hard to find.

58:20.854 --> 58:23.152
But now that I know,
I'll keep my eye out.

58:23.390 --> 58:25.324
Would you?

58:25.692 --> 58:27.751
Looking good, Denise. Good luck.

58:27.961 --> 58:32.455
Sir, you are really gonna
earn your money today.

58:37.371 --> 58:39.168
- Francis Gremp?
- Call me Chainsaw.

58:39.840 --> 58:43.071
- You're up next.
- Can you hold on a sec?

58:43.276 --> 58:45.403
Dad's late. He's so irresponsible.

58:45.612 --> 58:50.845
I said, "Dad, 3:00 sharp." But no,
it's just in one ear, out the other.

58:51.051 --> 58:52.279
I need your car.

58:53.019 --> 58:56.455
- You wanna use my car?
- I'm under adult supervision.

59:00.427 --> 59:02.486
Chainsaw, you take your test

59:02.696 --> 59:05.790
and you bring my car
right back here to me.

59:06.733 --> 59:09.566
You make me proud to be
an American. Dave, kiss this man.

59:09.770 --> 59:13.399
You, come with me. No, no, you
stay there. I'll bring the car to you.

59:13.607 --> 59:17.065
Can you back this up? I'm taking
a test. Just move all the way back.

59:24.050 --> 59:26.416
- What? What'd I do?
- Don't worry about me.

59:26.620 --> 59:29.521
See those cars on the right?
Go ahead and park in between.

59:29.723 --> 59:32.123
What do you mean?
You mean parallel park?

59:32.426 --> 59:35.293
- Something wrong?
- No, nothing.

59:51.778 --> 59:53.245
Yeah.

59:54.781 --> 59:57.249
We going on the freeway?

59:57.451 --> 01:00:00.352
I think we'll just stay
in the neighborhood.

01:00:04.191 --> 01:00:06.284
Why are you driving
with only one hand?

01:00:06.593 --> 01:00:10.085
Oh, this hand's gotta be free
to put around the babes.

01:00:11.298 --> 01:00:14.096
- Are you marking me off for that?
- Watch the dip!

01:00:15.168 --> 01:00:16.692
That dip?

01:00:17.137 --> 01:00:19.605
Hey, you crazy?

01:00:19.973 --> 01:00:23.101
Don't you ever, ever yell at the driver!
Do you hear me?

01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:25.870
- Where are you going?
- Back. The test is over.

01:00:26.112 --> 01:00:28.080
No way!

01:00:29.216 --> 01:00:30.706
That was your fault.

01:00:30.917 --> 01:00:33.317
This is bullshit. Come on.

01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:36.717
I stayed sober for this.
You can't do this.

01:00:36.923 --> 01:00:39.949
Come back, you dumb dildo.
Wait, no, you're not a dildo.

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:44.062
I was joking. That was a joke.
Come on, be cool. One more chance?

01:00:44.764 --> 01:00:46.561
Wait.

01:00:47.334 --> 01:00:51.566
You lost points for driving too slow
and not accepting the right of way.

01:00:51.771 --> 01:00:54.740
- Failed again.
- 70 is passing.

01:00:54.941 --> 01:00:56.431
Seventy-two.

01:00:57.611 --> 01:00:59.875
- I passed?
- You passed.

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.878
I passed! Oh, I passed! I passed!

01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:06.014
Shoop, I passed!

01:01:06.219 --> 01:01:08.449
I passed!

01:01:09.623 --> 01:01:13.286
- I passed! God, I passed! Thanks!
- I'm proud of you. Congratulations.

01:01:13.493 --> 01:01:16.724
- I couldn't have done it without you.
- Now, you drove the car.

01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:19.330
- Look, I owe you one, all right?
- Yeah?

01:01:19.533 --> 01:01:21.160
Yeah.

01:01:21.368 --> 01:01:23.996
OK. Tell you something
you can do for me.

01:01:24.471 --> 01:01:26.200
- What?
- Get help with reading.

01:01:26.406 --> 01:01:27.873
- Man.
- Listen, Denise.

01:01:28.074 --> 01:01:30.907
What you have is a learning disorder
called dyslexia.

01:01:31.111 --> 01:01:34.205
You need to retrain your brain
to deal with information.

01:01:34.414 --> 01:01:36.405
- There's a specialist.
- I'm doing fine.

01:01:36.616 --> 01:01:40.518
Yeah, you are.
But you could be doing so much better.

01:01:40.787 --> 01:01:42.914
But that's up to you.

01:01:43.323 --> 01:01:44.915
Hey.

01:01:45.559 --> 01:01:47.720
- Think about it, OK?
- OK, free film.

01:01:47.928 --> 01:01:51.261
Free developing.
Come on, what more could you want?

01:01:51.464 --> 01:01:53.091
Here.

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:57.760
Look, my dad's a butcher. You like
veal cutlets from Minnesota? Milk-fed.

01:02:15.956 --> 01:02:18.789
Hi, honey, how was your day?

01:02:19.459 --> 01:02:21.324
Hectic.

01:02:21.661 --> 01:02:25.222
- Boy, something smells good.
- The manicotti.

01:02:25.432 --> 01:02:29.300
Perfect timing. Why don't you
start on the cheese and crackers.

01:02:30.937 --> 01:02:32.666
Yeah. It's open.

01:02:32.872 --> 01:02:34.897
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:02:35.108 --> 01:02:38.009
I just brought this Ray Bradbury book.

01:02:38.211 --> 01:02:40.577
- Maybe I should come back later.
- Why?

01:02:42.849 --> 01:02:44.817
- Hi, Miss Bishop.
- Hi.

01:02:46.386 --> 01:02:49.913
Oh, Robin, Pam House,
one of my students.

01:02:50.123 --> 01:02:52.182
Pam, Robin Bishop.

01:02:52.525 --> 01:02:55.619
- Hi.
- Hi, Pam.

01:02:57.330 --> 01:03:01.164
Freddy, I didn't make enough for three.
If you plan on inviting company,

01:03:01.368 --> 01:03:03.563
- I wish you'd let me know.
- No, he wasn't.

01:03:03.770 --> 01:03:05.795
I stopped by to help him with a lesson.

01:03:06.006 --> 01:03:09.032
- But we can do that in the morning.
- Morning's much better.

01:03:09.242 --> 01:03:12.006
I'll make French toast for us.
Do you like French toast?

01:03:12.445 --> 01:03:14.174
I bet she makes great French toast.

01:03:14.381 --> 01:03:17.475
- I actually meant morning at school.
- Oh, fine.

01:03:17.684 --> 01:03:21.017
- It was nice to meet you, Pam.
- You too.

01:03:26.693 --> 01:03:27.955
Robin?

01:03:28.695 --> 01:03:32.791
I know this is none of my business,
but what the hell is going on in there?

01:03:32.999 --> 01:03:35.900
There's nothing going on in there.
Remember those bribes?

01:03:36.102 --> 01:03:39.367
- Well, Pam needed a place to stay.
- How long has she been here?

01:03:39.572 --> 01:03:41.836
A couple of days.

01:03:42.075 --> 01:03:44.873
My laundry's never smelled so good.
Here, take a whiff.

01:03:45.078 --> 01:03:47.876
Oh, I'm sure it's April fresh.

01:03:48.081 --> 01:03:50.242
I just hope having a maid

01:03:50.450 --> 01:03:53.010
is worth the damage
you could do to that young girl.

01:03:54.287 --> 01:03:56.482
See you tomorrow.

01:04:03.363 --> 01:04:06.264
- All ready.
- Great.

01:04:06.466 --> 01:04:10.869
- French or Italian?
- French.

01:04:11.071 --> 01:04:12.936
I knew it.

01:04:14.674 --> 01:04:18.508
- Pam, we gotta talk.
- Sure. What's up?

01:04:19.979 --> 01:04:24.416
- I think you are a great girl.
- And I think you're a great guy.

01:04:26.186 --> 01:04:27.881
God, this is hard.

01:04:28.088 --> 01:04:30.784
Freddy, go ahead.
You can tell me anything.

01:04:33.526 --> 01:04:37.394
OK. You know how,
when you're on your board,

01:04:37.597 --> 01:04:41.465
and you see the perfect wave rolling in
and you think you got it?

01:04:41.668 --> 01:04:44.398
Only, something happens
and you don't get it.

01:04:44.604 --> 01:04:47.164
I mean, the key
to the whole thing is timing.

01:04:47.373 --> 01:04:49.898
If you're even a little out of sync,
you're grim,

01:04:50.110 --> 01:04:52.908
you're blowing the barrel,
you're seaweed.

01:04:53.113 --> 01:04:55.138
But then you look outside

01:04:55.348 --> 01:04:58.647
and you see an even more perfect
wave than the first perfect wave

01:04:58.852 --> 01:05:00.979
and that's the one you catch.

01:05:01.187 --> 01:05:05.055
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yeah. Yeah, I get it.

01:05:05.258 --> 01:05:08.716
Surfing metaphors. You're
the perfect wave and I'm seaweed

01:05:08.928 --> 01:05:12.625
- and if you want me out, just say it.
- No, no, I'm not the perfect wave.

01:05:12.832 --> 01:05:14.629
And it's not just that I want you
out of my house.

01:05:14.834 --> 01:05:16.995
No, you want me out of your life.

01:05:18.004 --> 01:05:21.462
- Pam, look, I'm your teacher.
- No.

01:05:21.674 --> 01:05:25.770
Any time one person lets themself
care deeply about another person,

01:05:25.979 --> 01:05:29.346
that person runs the risk
of being rejected and destroyed.

01:05:29.549 --> 01:05:32.279
- I'll go get my things.
- No, wait. You cooked dinner.

01:05:32.485 --> 01:05:34.919
It looks beautiful.
Let's sit down, eat.

01:05:35.989 --> 01:05:37.980
It's just food.

01:05:44.030 --> 01:05:46.191
OK. I'm gonna collect
your book reports.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:49.098
Then we are on our way to court.

01:05:49.302 --> 01:05:51.202
Homework, Pam?

01:05:53.106 --> 01:05:55.301
You expect me to relate
to the written word

01:05:55.508 --> 01:05:57.999
after the hell you put me through?

01:05:58.211 --> 01:06:00.941
Talk about shallow.
I've stepped in deeper puddles.

01:06:01.147 --> 01:06:03.047
You're excused.

01:06:05.885 --> 01:06:08.012
Mr. Shoop, don't you want mine?

01:06:09.489 --> 01:06:13.823
Larry, you're awake, with homework.
What's wrong with you?

01:06:14.027 --> 01:06:16.018
I got fired.
They found out my real age.

01:06:16.229 --> 01:06:19.323
- Hey, I didn't say a word.
- No, my mom came to a show.

01:06:19.532 --> 01:06:22.023
- Your mother?
- It was a nightmare.

01:06:22.235 --> 01:06:25.636
I mean, before she knew who I was,
she put 5 bucks in my G-string.

01:06:25.839 --> 01:06:28.933
And then my Aunt Edna,
she kisses me.

01:06:29.142 --> 01:06:31.872
With tongue.
And rips off my mask.

01:06:32.078 --> 01:06:34.137
Mom freaked out.

01:06:34.347 --> 01:06:35.871
She made me put on her coat.

01:06:37.083 --> 01:06:38.710
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

01:06:38.918 --> 01:06:40.442
I'm at my sexual peak.

01:06:40.653 --> 01:06:44.384
Once a guy hits 18,
it's all downhill.

01:06:45.124 --> 01:06:47.251
But it's a lovely ride.

01:06:47.627 --> 01:06:50.095
Mr. Shoop, why did you tell
the arresting officers

01:06:50.296 --> 01:06:52.127
that the vodka found
in the possession

01:06:52.332 --> 01:06:56.063
of Mr. Gremp and Mr. Frazier
belonged to you?

01:06:56.269 --> 01:06:59.102
Your Honor, to keep
a couple of students out of trouble.

01:06:59.305 --> 01:07:02.240
David and Francis
have enough problems as it is.

01:07:02.575 --> 01:07:05.373
- It's true, Your Honor.
- Our lives are a mess.

01:07:06.446 --> 01:07:07.845
Guys, don't help.

01:07:08.414 --> 01:07:12.407
Where did you young men
obtain the vodka in question?

01:07:12.619 --> 01:07:14.086
- From Murray.
- Who's Murray?

01:07:14.287 --> 01:07:17.518
You know Murray.
Everybody knows Murray.

01:07:17.724 --> 01:07:19.624
From Murray's Liquor.

01:07:19.826 --> 01:07:22.124
Didn't this Murray ask
to see proof of age?

01:07:22.362 --> 01:07:24.193
Well, I come off pretty mature.

01:07:24.397 --> 01:07:27.730
- Did you show him proof of age?
- Yeah, I guess I did.

01:07:28.001 --> 01:07:30.026
May I see it, please?

01:07:30.236 --> 01:07:32.431
- I'd rather you didn't.
- I'd rather I did.

01:07:40.847 --> 01:07:44.078
You were a black Marine in 1968?

01:07:45.852 --> 01:07:47.217
Vietnam.

01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:49.820
A war puts a man through
many, many changes.

01:07:50.023 --> 01:07:54.187
Young man, the possession of false
identification and of alcohol by a minor

01:07:54.394 --> 01:07:57.625
are serious crimes.
You've just confessed to both of them.

01:07:57.830 --> 01:08:00.890
- I didn't mean to.
- However, since the arresting officers

01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:04.729
let you off with a warning,
I'll probably do the same.

01:08:05.071 --> 01:08:07.801
- Is this guy bitchen or what?
- Now, Mr. Shoop...

01:08:08.274 --> 01:08:09.832
Your Honor?

01:08:10.910 --> 01:08:12.639
My name is Robin Elizabeth Bishop

01:08:12.845 --> 01:08:15.939
and I'm also on the faculty
with the defendant.

01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:19.845
I submit that this man
went to jail for his students.

01:08:20.386 --> 01:08:23.981
Very few teachers ever exhibit
that degree of dedication.

01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:25.987
Therefore, Your Honor,
I move that...

01:08:26.192 --> 01:08:29.389
Don't move, Miss Bishop.
You're out of order.

01:08:29.595 --> 01:08:33.326
And you're also correct. Mr. Shoop,
these charges will be dropped.

01:08:33.533 --> 01:08:35.763
- Case dismissed.
- All right!

01:08:36.368 --> 01:08:39.736
All right! That's so...

01:08:41.908 --> 01:08:44.569
Shoop! Let me tell you something.

01:08:44.777 --> 01:08:47.006
The judge bought
that dedicated teacher crap,

01:08:47.212 --> 01:08:49.841
but you covered up,
thus condoning student drinking.

01:08:50.049 --> 01:08:53.644
I am filing a report for Kelban
with the entire story. Face it.

01:08:53.853 --> 01:08:58.916
The test scores won't save you,
because they're losers, just like you!

01:08:59.425 --> 01:09:00.653
Hi.

01:09:01.426 --> 01:09:04.362
I was just congratulating
our good friend Mr. Shoop.

01:09:05.231 --> 01:09:08.564
- Now, about lunch, sweetheart.
- Tell you what, sweetheart,

01:09:08.768 --> 01:09:12.260
why don't you go ahead, order
two lunches and eat them yourself.

01:09:12.471 --> 01:09:14.872
One for each face.

01:09:22.115 --> 01:09:27.246
OK. Today we take a practice test.
Pinpoint each of your weak spots.

01:09:27.453 --> 01:09:29.511
Then we work
a couple hours after school.

01:09:29.721 --> 01:09:33.020
Wait, wait.
Practice tests, extra class time?

01:09:33.225 --> 01:09:35.251
Not in the contract.
Eakian, get him.

01:09:35.627 --> 01:09:38.256
The test is in two weeks.
You need the extra work.

01:09:38.464 --> 01:09:41.627
Then I'm afraid we're gonna need
some extra incentive.

01:09:41.834 --> 01:09:45.736
- Yeah. Like a party with a band.
- I could use some wheels bad.

01:09:45.938 --> 01:09:48.064
And get me a job, man,
doing strip-o-grams.

01:09:48.741 --> 01:09:52.438
- I don't believe this greed.
- Believe it, man. I need a houseboy.

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:57.616
It's a simple matter
of renegotiating our contracts.

01:09:57.817 --> 01:10:00.945
Renegotiate? Who do you
think you are, Teamsters?

01:10:01.154 --> 01:10:05.750
Yeah, Teamsters!
Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!

01:10:08.227 --> 01:10:12.994
Look! For the past four weeks,
I have given up all of my free time.

01:10:13.199 --> 01:10:16.293
Had my body used for a tackling
dummy, my house trashed,

01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:19.536
my couch set on fire,
my goldfish murdered,

01:10:19.739 --> 01:10:22.867
my butt thrown in jail
and my car wrecked.

01:10:25.011 --> 01:10:27.411
All I'm asking for is a little extra effort.

01:10:28.815 --> 01:10:32.216
You know, what's sad is
you guys could all pass that test.

01:10:33.419 --> 01:10:36.980
But you're just so happy being failures
that you just don't know...

01:10:37.557 --> 01:10:39.650
Why am I doing this?

01:10:40.526 --> 01:10:42.460
Tell you what.

01:10:43.362 --> 01:10:45.728
You guys drop out and be illiterate.

01:10:45.932 --> 01:10:48.992
I'm going to Hawaii and be tan.

01:10:53.739 --> 01:10:55.331
Have a cow.

01:10:55.842 --> 01:10:57.810
Damn.

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:03.312
Hey. Thanks for the help.

01:11:04.484 --> 01:11:06.577
Good luck.

01:11:06.786 --> 01:11:08.651
- Where are you going?
- To quit.

01:11:08.855 --> 01:11:10.550
- You can't quit.
- Sure, I can.

01:11:10.756 --> 01:11:14.157
- I never got through to anybody.
- Not true. They were learning.

01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.918
- You're not a quitter.
- I am.

01:11:16.129 --> 01:11:18.723
I turned you down for dinner
at least a dozen times

01:11:18.931 --> 01:11:22.958
- and you haven't quit bugging me.
- Wanna go out to dinner tonight?

01:11:23.169 --> 01:11:26.036
- Can't.
- See?

01:11:32.111 --> 01:11:35.547
Everybody take a seat.
You, in the cot, out of bed.

01:11:35.915 --> 01:11:39.908
- Where's Mr. Shoop?
- He has tendered his resignation.

01:11:40.119 --> 01:11:41.882
Now, sit down.

01:11:42.088 --> 01:11:45.023
Would someone tell me what
Mr. Shoop had planned for today?

01:11:45.224 --> 01:11:48.284
- Yes?
- Group sex. No, that's tomorrow.

01:11:48.494 --> 01:11:51.486
Today's independent study,
right after our midmorning nap.

01:11:51.697 --> 01:11:53.892
Don't think you can pull
this BS with me.

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:59.197
Everybody take their textbooks out
and turn to chapter seven.

01:12:00.806 --> 01:12:02.034
Read it again.

01:12:10.783 --> 01:12:12.444
Who's making that noise?

01:12:14.287 --> 01:12:17.552
What noise? I don't hear any noise.
What, you got dog ears?

01:12:22.128 --> 01:12:25.564
- Chainsaw, stop doing that.
- Stop doing what?

01:12:26.732 --> 01:12:28.893
You know, I hear it too
and it's annoying.

01:12:29.235 --> 01:12:31.066
Find the hooligan that's responsible,

01:12:31.270 --> 01:12:35.604
because I am trying to read
chapter seven. Again.

01:12:45.017 --> 01:12:47.611
Mr. Gills, I cannot study.
I'm going to the library.

01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:50.220
Chainsaw, sit down.

01:12:50.423 --> 01:12:53.392
You can hum till your lips fall off,
I could care less.

01:12:54.126 --> 01:12:55.889
Wait a minute.
You're not dismissed.

01:12:57.563 --> 01:13:01.090
Now, I promise you, you people
act like psychopaths tomorrow

01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:04.064
- and you will be sorry.
- We will be sorry?

01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:08.400
Mr. Gills sure does know
his child psychology.

01:13:10.409 --> 01:13:14.243
Miss Cura, I want to let you know that
the children are a little hyperactive,

01:13:14.447 --> 01:13:17.848
but I'm sure that you'll
enjoy their joie de vivre.

01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:20.348
So far, I've only subbed
at grammar schools,

01:13:20.553 --> 01:13:23.886
so this should be a nice change.

01:13:24.457 --> 01:13:26.220
Help, Mr. Gills!

01:13:26.892 --> 01:13:29.258
Denise! Denise! Take it easy!
What happened?

01:13:29.462 --> 01:13:31.760
Don't go in there without a gun.
It's terrible.

01:13:31.964 --> 01:13:34.296
- Is this my classroom?
- Yes, it is.

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:37.401
Whose blood is that?
Is that your blood?

01:13:37.670 --> 01:13:39.570
No.

01:13:51.784 --> 01:13:53.081
My God.

01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:35.857
We're back!

01:14:40.833 --> 01:14:42.630
What is wrong with you people?

01:14:43.035 --> 01:14:47.802
It's like you said, Gills!
We're psychopaths!

01:14:49.442 --> 01:14:51.910
Somebody better call the school nurse!

01:14:53.846 --> 01:14:56.212
I am not amused!
Turn off those motors!

01:14:59.118 --> 01:15:01.086
Everybody get up. Now!

01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:11.195
I'm not ready for high school.

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:18.497
- Why'd she leave? Didn't she like us?
- Where's her sense of humor?

01:15:18.704 --> 01:15:21.605
I have seen some sick things before.

01:15:21.807 --> 01:15:24.708
But this... This is...

01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:26.707
- Devilishly clever.
- Vomitous!

01:15:27.046 --> 01:15:30.948
- Thank you.
- We take a lot of pride in our work.

01:15:31.150 --> 01:15:33.175
Look, we want Shoop back.

01:15:33.386 --> 01:15:35.911
Why would Shoop come back?
So Kelban can fire him?

01:15:36.122 --> 01:15:37.350
He might surprise you.

01:15:38.190 --> 01:15:43.560
- We did today.
- And we've got more for tomorrow.

01:15:47.433 --> 01:15:49.094
Do we have a deal?

01:16:04.950 --> 01:16:10.149
Wondermutt, I do not want to play.
Not now. I'm busy.

01:16:47.226 --> 01:16:49.353
- Tough day?
- We've been torturing Gills.

01:16:49.562 --> 01:16:51.655
Yeah.
He said you could have your job back.

01:16:51.931 --> 01:16:55.799
Now, why would I want my job back?
Hey, my life is sailing.

01:16:56.001 --> 01:17:02.907
I got a radio, blanket, beach chair,
dark glasses, dog.

01:17:03.309 --> 01:17:04.674
Why would I wanna go back?

01:17:04.877 --> 01:17:07.209
How about we can't pass that test
without you?

01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:12.014
Me and Chainsaw, we been sober for
two days, four hours and 15 minutes.

01:17:12.218 --> 01:17:15.346
- No kidding?
- Swear to God. Reality is so unreal.

01:17:15.554 --> 01:17:17.613
- But a nice change.
- Truly. Thumbs up.

01:17:20.793 --> 01:17:23.421
I think you should know
that you were a phase.

01:17:23.629 --> 01:17:25.688
I've outgrown you.

01:17:25.898 --> 01:17:28.560
But I do wanna be friends,
if you can handle it.

01:17:34.173 --> 01:17:35.640
And Shoop...

01:17:36.675 --> 01:17:39.200
...I'm seeing that reading specialist
this afternoon.

01:17:39.778 --> 01:17:44.875
Look. We'll study in school,
after school, whatever it takes.

01:17:45.084 --> 01:17:48.747
But we need a teacher.
What do you say, Mr. Shoop?

01:17:51.457 --> 01:17:53.652
Please?

01:18:01.133 --> 01:18:04.591
How can I say no
to these cute little faces?

01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:27.578
Your practice test scores were great.
Hey, come on,

01:19:27.786 --> 01:19:30.084
you been here 12 hours.
I want you to go home,

01:19:30.289 --> 01:19:33.053
forget about this test,
get a good night's sleep.

01:19:33.258 --> 01:19:35.988
I'll see you tomorrow,
8 AM, the lecture hall.

01:19:36.195 --> 01:19:40.131
Hey, trust me. Come on, you're gonna
kick ass and take names. Believe it.

01:19:40.499 --> 01:19:43.491
- Are we really that ready?
- Ready? What time's the test?

01:19:43.702 --> 01:19:46.899
- Eight AM.
- See, the correct answers do not stop.

01:19:47.106 --> 01:19:49.097
Now, go on, get out of here,
all of you,

01:19:49.308 --> 01:19:53.608
before the college recruiters show up
and try to drag you all off to Harvard.

01:19:54.713 --> 01:19:56.681
Hey, I mean it.

01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:17.391
Wondermutt, look. I found Bob.

01:20:19.738 --> 01:20:22.332
Go get it.

01:20:51.070 --> 01:20:52.833
Yeah!

01:20:58.911 --> 01:21:01.379
- Morning, Mom.
- Morning, sweetheart.

01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:03.639
Morning, Dad.

01:21:04.183 --> 01:21:06.947
How do you want your eggs, honey?
Fried, scrambled?

01:21:08.587 --> 01:21:10.487
I don't know.

01:21:10.689 --> 01:21:13.180
- What are eggs?
- I'll surprise you.

01:21:13.492 --> 01:21:15.585
How do you spell "cat"?

01:21:18.130 --> 01:21:21.622
- I don't know!
- Honey, what's wrong?

01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:25.233
I don't know what's wrong.
Every... Everything's blank.

01:21:25.437 --> 01:21:28.429
I don't know anything.
I don't know anything!

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:30.540
I don't know anything!

01:21:30.843 --> 01:21:33.573
Chainsaw! Chainsaw! Chainsaw!

01:21:33.779 --> 01:21:35.440
Are you all right?

01:21:35.647 --> 01:21:38.047
- I had a nightmare.
- About what?

01:21:39.251 --> 01:21:40.878
I don't know.

01:21:41.086 --> 01:21:43.111
- Great day for a test, huh?
- Yeah.

01:21:43.322 --> 01:21:45.313
Hey, Shoop.

01:21:47.359 --> 01:21:49.919
- An apple.
- For the teacher.

01:21:50.129 --> 01:21:52.063
Give them hell.

01:21:53.365 --> 01:21:56.334
- Hey, we're testing in here.
- I know, I'm in your class.

01:21:58.504 --> 01:22:01.098
I remember you.
Where you been?

01:22:01.306 --> 01:22:03.331
Bathroom.

01:22:03.542 --> 01:22:06.670
- Six weeks?
- My zipper got stuck.

01:22:09.681 --> 01:22:13.674
"Do not open the test booklets
until you are told to do so.

01:22:13.886 --> 01:22:15.454
"Using a number two pencil, take your
answer sheet and fill in your name.

01:22:15.454 --> 01:22:17.854
"Using a number two pencil, take your
answer sheet and fill in your name.

01:22:18.056 --> 01:22:22.686
"Last name first, first name second,
middle initial last on the first line.

01:22:22.895 --> 01:22:24.419
"Do this now."

01:22:25.330 --> 01:22:29.164
This officer is here to see
that there is no cheating.

01:22:30.068 --> 01:22:33.595
This officer is here to see
that there is no cheating.

01:22:35.007 --> 01:22:39.171
Festival of screwups and their king.

01:22:40.479 --> 01:22:44.472
Mr. Gills extends his warmest
personal regards and best wishes.

01:22:44.683 --> 01:22:46.116
Hey, thanks for caring, man.

01:22:47.820 --> 01:22:50.550
OK. Break the seals
on your test booklets now.

01:22:51.323 --> 01:22:54.952
And turn to the section titled
Reading Vocabulary.

01:22:55.627 --> 01:22:58.892
"You will have 20 minutes
to complete this section."

01:22:59.865 --> 01:23:01.492
Everybody ready?

01:23:02.801 --> 01:23:05.497
No!

01:23:10.209 --> 01:23:12.200
Tension breaker, had to be done.

01:23:12.744 --> 01:23:13.972
Anybody else?

01:23:17.816 --> 01:23:19.875
Good luck, gang.

01:23:20.986 --> 01:23:22.817
Ready.

01:23:23.522 --> 01:23:25.149
Begin.

01:23:34.132 --> 01:23:35.724
Sorry.

01:25:37.089 --> 01:25:38.317
Kevin.

01:25:40.993 --> 01:25:42.517
It's starting.

01:25:42.728 --> 01:25:44.389
Now?

01:25:44.596 --> 01:25:46.154
Shit.

01:25:46.798 --> 01:25:48.288
How far apart?

01:25:49.201 --> 01:25:50.896
Twelve minutes.

01:25:51.103 --> 01:25:52.627
Try and slow it down.

01:25:54.706 --> 01:25:56.037
Forget about the...

01:26:08.754 --> 01:26:11.518
- Thirty seconds left.
- Come on, come on.

01:26:11.723 --> 01:26:13.554
C, C,

01:26:13.859 --> 01:26:17.920
C, C, C,

01:26:18.797 --> 01:26:22.028
C, C, C, C.

01:26:22.634 --> 01:26:24.795
- And...
- Wait 20 more seconds.

01:26:25.003 --> 01:26:27.836
- Twenty seconds.
...stop. Pencils down.

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:30.201
C, C, C.

01:26:30.742 --> 01:26:32.369
Drop them!

01:26:33.545 --> 01:26:35.979
Stay seated until Anna-Maria
picks up your tests.

01:26:36.181 --> 01:26:39.708
Miss Mazarelli, may I have those tests
after you collect them, please?

01:26:40.519 --> 01:26:42.646
- Yeah.
- Can Rhonda and I be excused?

01:26:42.854 --> 01:26:44.913
She's having a baby.

01:26:45.123 --> 01:26:47.648
- She's having a baby?
- Oh, I wanna see this.

01:26:47.859 --> 01:26:51.420
Calm down! Everybody just stay
in your seats. No problem here at all.

01:26:51.630 --> 01:26:53.564
Rhonda, why didn't
you say something?

01:26:53.765 --> 01:26:57.064
- I wanted to finish my test.
- You need hot water, a ride?

01:26:57.269 --> 01:26:59.533
- All we need is a hospital.
- What can I do?

01:26:59.738 --> 01:27:01.535
- Get out of my way.
- I can do that.

01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:05.335
Carmine, get out of her way!
Get the door.

01:27:07.279 --> 01:27:10.578
- Save the umbilical cord.
- And the afterbirth, if convenient.

01:27:10.782 --> 01:27:12.613
Good thinking.

01:27:13.218 --> 01:27:15.015
Oh, easy, easy, this way. Watch out.

01:27:16.054 --> 01:27:19.251
- You look terrific.
- Well, I'm feeling pretty good.

01:27:19.458 --> 01:27:21.050
That's great.

01:27:21.259 --> 01:27:24.160
The baby is healthy and happy.

01:27:24.596 --> 01:27:27.087
And my coach was incredible.

01:27:27.299 --> 01:27:30.132
Yeah, well, I couldn't
have done it without you.

01:27:30.469 --> 01:27:32.596
No cord, huh?

01:27:33.872 --> 01:27:35.965
When do we get to see
the whippersnapper?

01:27:36.174 --> 01:27:38.904
Rhonda, don't let those two
near the baby, please.

01:27:40.312 --> 01:27:42.872
Well, it won't be a problem.

01:27:43.615 --> 01:27:46.106
I'm giving her up for adoption.

01:27:48.453 --> 01:27:52.014
- She's going to a really good home.
- That's nice.

01:27:52.657 --> 01:27:54.352
I'm not ready to be a mom.

01:27:59.331 --> 01:28:01.595
- Mr. Shoop.
- Ciao.

01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:03.324
Ciao, gang. How's it going?

01:28:04.035 --> 01:28:05.502
- All right.
- OK.

01:28:08.707 --> 01:28:10.436
Bad news?

01:28:11.877 --> 01:28:14.277
Gills says he's mailing you
your scores.

01:28:14.779 --> 01:28:17.543
- We failed.
- He just said the average grade

01:28:17.749 --> 01:28:19.910
- was below passing.
- So we failed.

01:28:20.118 --> 01:28:22.882
Hey, you didn't fail.

01:28:23.088 --> 01:28:25.147
I failed.

01:28:26.825 --> 01:28:31.762
Field trips to the beach, a bed in your
classroom, drinking at the beach,

01:28:31.963 --> 01:28:35.330
a screening of
Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1.

01:28:35.567 --> 01:28:38.627
- Quite a summer, Mr. Shoop.
- I tried to keep it interesting.

01:28:38.837 --> 01:28:42.034
I have his dismissal
ready for your signature, sir.

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:44.003
Before I sign anything,

01:28:44.209 --> 01:28:48.236
I understand there are some people
waiting to speak in Mr. Shoop's behalf.

01:28:48.446 --> 01:28:51.677
- Really?
- Come in.

01:28:52.150 --> 01:28:55.916
Mr. Kelban, you're not actually
going to listen to these delinquents?

01:28:56.121 --> 01:28:59.522
No. I'm gonna listen to their parents.

01:29:12.837 --> 01:29:14.998
I'm Principal Kelban.

01:29:15.207 --> 01:29:18.904
- Is there a spokesperson here?
- I guess I am. I'm Howard Gremp.

01:29:19.344 --> 01:29:21.369
You're Chainsaw's father.

01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:24.674
- Interesting boy.
- No, you can say it. He's a lunatic.

01:29:24.883 --> 01:29:26.350
Dad.

01:29:26.551 --> 01:29:29.918
You know, six weeks ago, I thought
he had the IQ of a salad bar.

01:29:30.121 --> 01:29:33.147
His only interest in life
was to make people sick.

01:29:33.358 --> 01:29:37.988
If my mother came to dinner, he would
give the dog a third eye or an extra leg.

01:29:38.263 --> 01:29:41.289
Because of him,
we stopped having kids.

01:29:41.967 --> 01:29:45.528
I mean, you can imagine the feeling
when I saw him studying.

01:29:45.737 --> 01:29:48.535
The wife and I almost burst into tears.

01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:51.607
- David was doing his homework too.
- It makes sense,

01:29:51.810 --> 01:29:53.243
they share the same brain.

01:29:53.612 --> 01:29:57.013
Not only did Mr. Shoop
get my daughter to read,

01:29:57.215 --> 01:29:58.443
he taught her to drive.

01:29:58.650 --> 01:30:01.983
He showed Kevin there's more to life
than just football.

01:30:02.187 --> 01:30:07.250
- I'm not sure I agree, but it's possible.
- This man should not be teaching.

01:30:07.459 --> 01:30:10.792
Proof is here in these test results.
Look for yourself, Mr. Shoop.

01:30:11.896 --> 01:30:15.423
Passing is 70.
Average score here was 63.

01:30:16.501 --> 01:30:20.460
- They failed.
- That is not true, Mr. Gills.

01:30:20.672 --> 01:30:22.537
- We passed?
- No, not all of you.

01:30:22.741 --> 01:30:25.107
But that's not what's important here.

01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:26.572
Larry.

01:30:26.778 --> 01:30:30.908
Went from an 18 to a 51!

01:30:31.116 --> 01:30:33.516
If I'd only seen you strip
a week sooner. You!

01:30:33.718 --> 01:30:35.447
- Mom, my hair.
- Rhonda.

01:30:35.654 --> 01:30:39.886
From a 29 to a 43
and she gave birth.

01:30:40.091 --> 01:30:43.458
Isn't childbirth
grounds for a makeup test?

01:30:43.762 --> 01:30:45.627
It always has been.

01:30:47.098 --> 01:30:48.690
This woman thing never fails.

01:30:49.134 --> 01:30:53.264
Eakian. A 51 to a 74.

01:30:54.172 --> 01:30:57.198
I passed!
I am an Eakian, Grams.

01:30:57.409 --> 01:30:59.001
- All right, Eaker.
- Denise.

01:30:59.210 --> 01:31:03.169
No previous test score because
you ditched every test, but a 38.

01:31:03.381 --> 01:31:06.509
- Honey, that's terrific.
- We'll get them next time.

01:31:07.018 --> 01:31:08.246
- Kevin.
- Yeah?

01:31:08.453 --> 01:31:11.479
From a 48 to a 75!

01:31:11.690 --> 01:31:13.317
Yeah! I'm back on the team!

01:31:13.525 --> 01:31:17.291
- Yeah! Kill!
- Yeah! Kill!

01:31:21.299 --> 01:31:26.362
Chainsaw. Last score was a 6.
This time, 59. Monster comeback.

01:31:26.571 --> 01:31:28.436
- All right.
- And Dave.

01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:30.505
From a 26 to a 70.

01:31:30.775 --> 01:31:32.003
I passed!

01:31:32.210 --> 01:31:33.541
- You made it!
- You passed?

01:31:33.745 --> 01:31:36.942
You passed and I failed, asshole!
How could you do that to me?

01:31:37.248 --> 01:31:40.649
It was an accident.
I'll take it again. I can fail, I know it.

01:31:40.852 --> 01:31:45.789
And Pam went from a 53 to an 82.

01:31:46.925 --> 01:31:48.825
- Was that the highest?
- Well, almost.

01:31:49.027 --> 01:31:52.326
I mean, that guy who spent six weeks
in the bathroom got a 91.

01:31:52.530 --> 01:31:55.988
But look, there's more going on here
than test scores and grades.

01:31:56.201 --> 01:31:58.169
You all worked hard
and you improved.

01:31:58.403 --> 01:32:00.837
And that's very nice, Mr. Shoop.

01:32:01.039 --> 01:32:04.475
We are here to discuss
his flagrant violation of school policies.

01:32:04.676 --> 01:32:06.439
Hold it, Gills.

01:32:10.048 --> 01:32:11.606
According to my numbers,

01:32:11.816 --> 01:32:15.183
the average scores here
increased from 28 to 63.

01:32:15.387 --> 01:32:18.049
That's 125 percent improvement.
Now, that's teaching.

01:32:18.256 --> 01:32:19.848
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

01:32:20.058 --> 01:32:22.959
Mr. Shoop, I'm granting you tenure.

01:32:25.263 --> 01:32:27.823
He's back, ladies and gentlemen!

01:32:46.317 --> 01:32:50.845
This is the last time I ask. I promise.

01:32:51.456 --> 01:32:53.981
Will you have dinner with me?

01:32:54.826 --> 01:32:57.090
I'll think about it.

01:32:59.898 --> 01:33:02.560
Can I use some of that lip stuff?

01:33:21.286 --> 01:33:24.346
Does this mean we can
have dinner tonight?

01:33:24.556 --> 01:33:26.956
I didn't say that.

01:33:27.592 --> 01:33:31.119
We'll just talk about it over breakfast.
