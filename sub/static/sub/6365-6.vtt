WEBVTT

00:01.201 --> 00:02.768
<i>Previously on</i> reign...

00:02.770 --> 00:04.470
Kenna, what are
you reading?
It's a sex journal.

00:04.472 --> 00:06.538
One has me stumped.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.240
"a lover who towers
above the rest."

00:08.242 --> 00:09.641
<i>She says he has a small</i>

00:09.643 --> 00:10.676
<i>Butterfly-shaped birthmark</i>

00:10.678 --> 00:11.777
<i>On his forearm.</i>

00:11.779 --> 00:13.645
You've never been in love.

00:13.647 --> 00:17.049
That is a rare jewel
I have yet to see.

00:17.051 --> 00:19.585
This was all your doing,
wasn't it?
Yes.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.253
Coaxing some kind
of admission from me.

00:21.255 --> 00:23.022
I also have montgomery,

00:23.024 --> 00:24.390
Ready to tell the world

00:24.392 --> 00:26.392
That he didn't kill your father
if I give the word.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.027
Francis, what aren't
you telling me?

00:28.029 --> 00:30.362
There are things
we cannot change.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.097
That cannot be undone.

00:32.099 --> 00:33.532
Things that I don't tell you
to protect you.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.800
Protect me
from what?!

00:34.802 --> 00:37.036
Do you worry that
I can't bear your child?

00:37.038 --> 00:39.605
Yes, I worry because, as a king
and a man, I want heirs.

00:39.607 --> 00:42.041
Is that what you want to hear?

00:42.043 --> 00:43.609
Does it bring us closer
for you to know

00:43.611 --> 00:47.179
That your failure disappoints me
beyond words?

00:50.083 --> 00:51.817
Man: We've set fire
to the house and fields.

00:51.819 --> 00:54.286
The only thing not burning are
the bee hives.

00:54.288 --> 00:57.122
Man 2: Why not set fire
to them as well?

00:57.124 --> 01:00.359
Don't tell me you're afraid
of a few bees.

01:00.361 --> 01:03.262
Burn the hives,
burn it all.

01:06.099 --> 01:08.534
(weeps)

01:10.804 --> 01:14.073
It seems my entire day will be
devoted to the venetian envoy.

01:14.075 --> 01:16.141
Well, let me know if there's
anything I can do to help.

01:16.143 --> 01:17.276
No need.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.344
All he wants
to do is hunt,

01:19.346 --> 01:21.180
Drink and dance with
the court ladies.

01:21.182 --> 01:22.848
I've never seen an italian
with less grace.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.216
Or bigger feet.

01:24.218 --> 01:25.717
He tramped on
kenna's toes.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.786
She actually limped
back to bash.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.721
Well, even you said
that the poor man's boots were

01:29.723 --> 01:30.722
The size of gunboats.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.157
Francis.

01:32.159 --> 01:34.326
I don't want to have
to play a part with you.

01:34.328 --> 01:37.129
I don't want to pretend
that I'm happy when I'm not.

01:37.131 --> 01:38.564
Mary...
I know

01:38.566 --> 01:41.533
That I insisted
you tell me what was wrong.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.535
But it was harsh
to hear just the same.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.140
I didn't realize how
disappointed you were with me

01:48.142 --> 01:51.343
For not giving you a child.

01:51.345 --> 01:55.314
But I'm glad that you were
honest with me.

01:55.316 --> 01:58.150
That's what we need the most
from each other.

01:58.152 --> 02:01.453
Give me time,
and I'll come to terms with it.

02:04.657 --> 02:06.425
I'll take the velvet cloak,
arnaud.

02:06.427 --> 02:08.160
It makes a better statement.

02:08.162 --> 02:10.429
Oh, and tell the kitchen
to put together a basket--

02:10.431 --> 02:13.765
Fresh figs, bread and cheese,
and a good burgundy.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.400
I might get peckish on the way.

02:15.402 --> 02:16.468
At once, your grace.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.803
Oh, and a
warming brick,

02:17.805 --> 02:19.304
Wrapped in sheep's
wool, for my feet.

02:19.306 --> 02:22.341
Ah, mary.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.743
Whatever it is,
it must wait till tomorrow.

02:24.745 --> 02:28.814
I'm off to beauvais
to put in an appearance

02:28.816 --> 02:30.582
At lord gramont's
saint day party.

02:30.584 --> 02:31.917
It always softens up the nobles

02:31.919 --> 02:34.586
When a queen appears
at their gatherings.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.321
A sop to their vanity.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.328
Why don't I come
with you, then?

02:43.330 --> 02:47.799
My dear, it will be
a terrible bore.

02:47.801 --> 02:50.836
Even keeping it
to a small retinue of guards,

02:50.838 --> 02:52.237
The ride will take hours.

02:52.239 --> 02:52.938
It'll be good for me

02:52.940 --> 02:54.339
To get out of the castle.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.208
It's fresh air, time to think.

02:56.210 --> 02:59.444
You know what you need is
a nice, long walk, huh?

02:59.446 --> 03:02.381
If one queen
impresses the nobles,

03:02.383 --> 03:04.283
How much better
would two queens be?

03:04.285 --> 03:07.286
Hmm.

03:08.388 --> 03:10.689
What are you doing out here,
all by yourself?

03:12.625 --> 03:14.293
I had to get away.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.295
The nannies, the servants,

03:16.297 --> 03:17.863
The hangers-on who think
they'll impress francis

03:17.865 --> 03:19.298
By taking an interest
in his son.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.632
Is that why you've been crying?

03:22.335 --> 03:24.636
My family heard that
francis has claimed my son.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.271
And it didn't go well.

03:27.540 --> 03:28.874
He is the king of France.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.209
As far as they're concerned,

03:30.211 --> 03:31.944
That just makes
the disgrace even worse.

03:31.946 --> 03:34.713
My name's on everyone's lips--
I'm notorious.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.448
They've disowned me.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.916
Cut me off.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.384
Oh, lola, I'm so sorry.

03:39.386 --> 03:42.421
I'll never be admitted
into the house again.

03:42.423 --> 03:44.790
No one will even
mention my name there.

03:44.792 --> 03:46.992
This is the last letter
I'll ever get from home.

03:46.994 --> 03:51.230
And my new home is
full of strangers,

03:51.232 --> 03:53.632
And I'm trapped here with them.

03:53.634 --> 03:55.500
Even francis and I are
strangers these days,

03:55.502 --> 03:56.802
So stiff with each other.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.337
This is why women

03:58.339 --> 04:00.839
Like you and me need
to prepare for the future.

04:00.841 --> 04:02.808
Hold onto the jewels,
to any gifts of land.

04:02.810 --> 04:04.810
Anything can happen.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.411
I was in a similar
position, remember?

04:06.413 --> 04:08.013
I had a lot of time
to think, with henry,

04:08.015 --> 04:10.482
And kings are no guarantee
of anything.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.985
Kings have enemies,
wars, rivals.

04:12.987 --> 04:14.653
And what's the first thing
a rival does

04:14.655 --> 04:16.255
When he takes the throne?

04:16.257 --> 04:17.723
He kills the sons
of the previous king.

04:17.725 --> 04:20.659
Kenna, you're not
cheering me up, you know.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.728
No, I'm telling you
this to protect you.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.896
Should francis ever be deposed,
you need to be prepared

04:24.898 --> 04:27.399
To take your child and flee.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.567
Start building a nest egg.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.002
Ask for more expensive jewelry.

04:30.004 --> 04:32.738
That's the problem.

04:32.740 --> 04:35.407
God willing, francis will live
a long and healthy life.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.909
And I'll be dependent
on him forever.

04:37.911 --> 04:40.879
I don't want jewels,
I just want something of my own.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.447
Something no one can take away.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.516
Lola, we're women.

04:44.518 --> 04:48.387
We're not allowed
to have things of our own.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.555
Legally, bash even owns
my kohl sticks and lip rouge,

04:50.557 --> 04:52.924
Though I'd like to see him try
and take those away.

04:55.428 --> 04:57.629
But I don't have a husband.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.565
Or a family, anymore.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.968
Legally, no one has
a right to what is mine.

05:02.970 --> 05:07.606
So, if I can get some money
of my own, I can keep it.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.408
And I will.

05:17.450 --> 05:20.018
Something's wrong-- we're riding
in the wrong direction.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.987
We're still going east,
instead of south to beauvais.

05:21.989 --> 05:25.357
I may have told a small white
lie about where we were going.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.659
Turn this carriage around,
right now.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.995
Mary, what difference
does it make?

05:29.997 --> 05:31.630
You said you wanted
some fresh air.

05:33.533 --> 05:34.733
Is there some reason
in particular

05:34.735 --> 05:35.967
You wanted to go to beauvais?

05:35.969 --> 05:37.903
Of course not.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.806
But where are we going?
(chuckles)

05:40.808 --> 05:43.675
And what is this paper
you've been studying?

05:43.677 --> 05:45.010
Oh, it's a speech.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.578
Thanking the village
of noyon

05:46.580 --> 05:47.746
For their love.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.815
Their love of you?

05:49.817 --> 05:53.085
Noyon is one
of my special villages.

05:53.087 --> 05:56.388
When their church steeple falls,
I rebuild it.

05:56.390 --> 05:57.823
In your name.
Yes, of course you're popular.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.825
But why make
such effort?

05:59.827 --> 06:01.727
Every time I try
to help the commoners,

06:01.729 --> 06:04.129
You tell me I need
to placate the nobles.

06:04.131 --> 06:06.732
Because it's a balancing act.

06:06.734 --> 06:09.901
The nobles are just one leg
on the three-legged stool

06:09.903 --> 06:10.969
That holds up France.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.504
If ever that
stool goes down,

06:12.506 --> 06:14.773
You and I will end up flat
on our royal fundaments.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.775
But peasants--

06:16.777 --> 06:18.677
You have never cared about them.

06:18.679 --> 06:23.648
Oh, I may not care
about peasants individually.

06:23.650 --> 06:26.451
But in general,
I care a great deal.

06:26.453 --> 06:27.753
And so should you.

06:27.755 --> 06:31.590
Our gowns, our crowns,
our chateaus--

06:31.592 --> 06:34.426
They all depend on the
good will of the commoner.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.161
For a very good reason.

06:36.163 --> 06:41.500
There's 20 million of them,
and one small family of royals.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.469
To survive,
we must have their love.

06:44.471 --> 06:46.938
Thank heavens, I can buy it.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.441
And if things happen to get
too dangerous for you at court,

06:49.443 --> 06:52.010
You can always flee
to one of these towns,

06:52.012 --> 06:53.178
And they'll help you
escape the country.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.780
If you were wise,

06:54.782 --> 06:57.182
You'd develop a few bolt-holes
yourself, my dear.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.117
You have plenty of enemies.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.118
Man:
Whoa!

07:00.120 --> 07:01.953
(horse neighs)

07:01.955 --> 07:04.523
What's happening?

07:04.525 --> 07:06.191
Why are we slowing down?!

07:06.193 --> 07:08.527
We're hours
from noyon!

07:08.529 --> 07:11.062
Man: There are people gathering
in the road ahead!

07:11.064 --> 07:13.131
(overlapping chatter)

07:13.133 --> 07:15.434
Clear the road!
Don't let 'em by.

07:15.436 --> 07:16.868
Clear the road
for the queen of France!

07:16.870 --> 07:17.869
It's them!

07:17.871 --> 07:19.104
It's the royal carriage!

07:19.106 --> 07:19.971
Don't let 'em by!

07:20.973 --> 07:21.940
(overlapping chatter)

07:21.942 --> 07:24.075
No, they're angry.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.111
Perhaps we could talk to them,
hear their grievances.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.212
Man:
Kill the royals!

07:27.214 --> 07:29.448
Perhaps not right now.

07:29.450 --> 07:32.584
To lay hands
on a royal person is death!

07:32.586 --> 07:34.453
Oh, good lord.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.455
Threatening a royal
is death, too.

07:36.457 --> 07:39.958
The fool has just told them
they've got nothing to lose.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.827
Come, we must escape.

07:41.829 --> 07:42.994
To where?

07:42.996 --> 07:44.529
We're trapped
inside a carriage.

07:45.832 --> 07:46.965
All my carriages
have them.

07:46.967 --> 07:47.966
Well, one
never knows.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.534
Come!

07:56.909 --> 07:59.811
(grunting)

08:06.052 --> 08:07.819
We have to keep moving!

08:07.821 --> 08:10.522
They might look for us when
they find the carriage is empty.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.023
Take off your jewelry
and turn your cloak inside out.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.526
It'll make us look
less like royals.

08:14.528 --> 08:17.028
It's a long way
back to the castle.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.498
Better get started.

08:22.902 --> 08:25.637
(fast tempo acoustic
intro playing)

08:28.107 --> 08:30.609
â™ª they all need something

08:30.611 --> 08:35.514
â™ª to hold on to,
they all mean well â™ª

08:35.516 --> 08:39.017
â™ª you could never
feel my story â™ª

08:39.019 --> 08:42.921
â™ª it's all you know... Oh!

08:42.923 --> 08:46.024
â™ª

08:58.271 --> 09:02.073
Lady lola, how delighted I
was to receive your message.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.174
How may I help you?

09:03.176 --> 09:04.609
You held my husband,

09:04.611 --> 09:05.810
Lord julien's, bank account.

09:05.812 --> 09:07.112
You transferred
my dowry into it.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.580
Yes.

09:08.582 --> 09:09.814
Now that my husband is dead,

09:09.816 --> 09:11.116
I'd like it back.

09:11.118 --> 09:13.818
<i>Your</i> dowry?

09:13.820 --> 09:18.089
Forgive me, but I cannot return
it, as the money is not yours.

09:18.091 --> 09:21.126
Well, it's my dowry.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.861
It was your father's.

09:22.863 --> 09:25.697
It became lord julien's
upon your marriage.

09:25.699 --> 09:28.133
Since he's dead, it would
go to his male heir,

09:28.135 --> 09:30.201
But now that the king
has claimed your child,

09:30.203 --> 09:32.804
It would revert to the head
of lord julien's family.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.706
His father, back in hungary.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.309
Well, that's ridiculous. I've
never even met julien's father.

09:37.311 --> 09:40.278
It's complicated, but he
and julien were estranged.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.813
Nonetheless.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.148
Are you telling me

09:43.150 --> 09:44.149
That you've already
sent it to him?

09:44.151 --> 09:46.184
Well, no, I...

09:46.186 --> 09:48.153
I still have
to verify his address,

09:48.155 --> 09:49.788
Arrange for trustworthy
messengers...

09:49.790 --> 09:51.623
Hmm, my father always told me

09:51.625 --> 09:53.658
That bankers like to hold onto
money for as long as they can.

09:53.660 --> 09:55.794
Why do you deserve
to pocket the interest?

09:55.796 --> 09:57.228
You're not related to any of us.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.264
I will not have
my reputation impugned.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.000
Be assured I will take
what steps are necessary

10:02.002 --> 10:04.269
To send this money
to hungary tomorrow.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.271
Good day, lady lola.

10:09.308 --> 10:10.308
It was a fox hole.
Badger.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.843
Fox! And how would you know?

10:11.845 --> 10:13.244
You didn't even see it.

10:13.246 --> 10:14.913
I saw it after my foot
got caught in it!

10:14.915 --> 10:17.983
And my feet are too dainty
to get caught in a fox hole!

10:17.985 --> 10:20.251
We've been stumbling
along for hours!

10:20.253 --> 10:22.320
Do you have any idea
where we're going?

10:22.322 --> 10:24.322
No, but we are more
or less headed west,

10:24.324 --> 10:26.191
Which means eventually we...
Wait!

10:26.193 --> 10:28.827
I see a village ahead.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.362
Thank heavens!

10:30.364 --> 10:32.864
But we don't have
any money.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.332
Of course we don't have money.

10:34.334 --> 10:36.234
Queens don't hand over
coins like shopkeepers.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.370
Purses are for servants!

10:38.372 --> 10:39.904
We can't tell them who we are!

10:39.906 --> 10:41.106
Even if they believed us,

10:41.108 --> 10:42.240
What if they hate royals, too?

10:42.242 --> 10:43.875
I swear on the blessed saints,

10:43.877 --> 10:45.210
I shall have my dinner!

10:45.212 --> 10:48.213
One way or another.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.215
(grunting)

10:50.217 --> 10:52.283
(indistinct chatter)

10:56.756 --> 10:59.257
Innkeeper! Ah!

10:59.259 --> 11:00.859
My good man!
(chuckles)

11:00.861 --> 11:03.194
We require your best capon.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.363
Freshly killed, well-baked.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.298
Seasoned with basil
and rosemary.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.235
And a bottle of whatever
passes for wine.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.337
Let's see the shine
of your coin first.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.939
Are you trying
to insult me?

11:14.941 --> 11:16.274
Do you make
all your patrons

11:16.276 --> 11:17.275
Turn out their pockets

11:17.277 --> 11:18.710
Before you deign to serve them?

11:18.712 --> 11:21.012
I know my customers.
I don't know you.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.213
No money?

11:22.215 --> 11:23.848
No service.
You turn away

11:23.850 --> 11:25.050
At your peril.
We are friends

11:25.052 --> 11:26.718
Of the lord
of this region.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.053
Friends of the duke?

11:28.055 --> 11:30.021
The duke.
On the road?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.056
Without an escort?

11:31.058 --> 11:32.424
Without a carriage?

11:32.426 --> 11:34.225
I didn't hear
no horses outside...

11:34.227 --> 11:35.393
Madam.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.461
Wait!

11:36.463 --> 11:38.963
You're right.
The truth is...

11:38.965 --> 11:40.331
We're lady's maids.

11:40.333 --> 11:43.001
These gowns are cast-offs
from our mistresses.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.703
The family we used
to work for

11:44.705 --> 11:46.805
Was destroyed by the plague.

11:46.807 --> 11:49.274
So here we are...
(groans)

11:49.276 --> 11:50.809
Mother,

11:50.811 --> 11:52.811
Daughter...
(groans, mumbles)

11:52.813 --> 11:54.312
...Trying to return to our

11:54.314 --> 11:57.148
Native village far away.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.817
My mother has hurt her foot.

11:58.819 --> 12:01.419
Oh.
We will work for a meal
and for a bed

12:01.421 --> 12:02.454
To sleep in tonight.
What?

12:02.456 --> 12:04.723
We can wash dishes, milk a cow

12:04.725 --> 12:05.824
Or a goat if you have one.

12:05.826 --> 12:06.925
Girl like you would make

12:06.927 --> 12:07.959
More money serving drinks.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.728
Can you do that?
Done.

12:11.130 --> 12:13.231
Back table.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.899
I do have a goat

12:14.901 --> 12:16.067
Out back.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.903
Alas, my poor ankle. Ah.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.806
My daughter shall have
to work for both of us.

12:27.947 --> 12:31.149
Your majesty, I've rarely
known such hospitality.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.917
The doge will be
delighted to hear

12:32.919 --> 12:34.352
That you intend
to continue the friendship

12:34.354 --> 12:35.754
We enjoyed with your father.

12:35.756 --> 12:36.855
Bash:
Francis?

12:36.857 --> 12:38.056
We must speak.

12:44.463 --> 12:47.098
Queen mary and queen catherine
are missing!

12:47.100 --> 12:48.399
Their carriage was attacked.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.201
We must search
for them immediately!

12:50.203 --> 12:52.103
I want every guard,
every nobleman who can join us.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.505
My men and I are
at your disposal.

12:53.507 --> 12:55.106
We leave at once.

12:57.109 --> 12:58.476
Stay here.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.044
I'm naming you temporary regent
while I'm gone.

13:00.046 --> 13:01.212
I need someone here
that I can trust.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.413
Keep the envoy happy.

13:05.885 --> 13:08.386
To the king and queen!

13:08.388 --> 13:09.420
Oh. Ah.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.189
Hmm, well...

13:11.191 --> 13:13.024
We're not hated everywhere,
it seems.

13:14.026 --> 13:16.361
Mmm.

13:16.363 --> 13:19.264
I suppose it's too late
to try and convince them

13:19.266 --> 13:20.899
Of who we are now.
What?

13:20.901 --> 13:22.233
After trying
to cheat a free meal

13:22.235 --> 13:23.368
And claiming to be lady's maids?

13:23.370 --> 13:24.402
We'd be lucky

13:24.404 --> 13:26.938
If they didn't
lock us up or worse.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.274
And if they do believe us, we'd
be an incitement to kidnapping.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.975
No.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.077
We must think practically.

13:33.079 --> 13:34.546
We need to buy a horse.

13:34.548 --> 13:37.148
Do you have any idea
how much a horse costs?

13:37.150 --> 13:39.117
Of course!

13:39.119 --> 13:41.953
I once bought 50 arabians.

13:41.955 --> 13:43.087
(scoffs)
I'm sure some

13:43.089 --> 13:44.556
Swaybacked farmer's nag

13:44.558 --> 13:46.391
Costs barely anything at all.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.159
I couldn't earn
enough in a year.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.094
And we can't show our jewels

13:50.096 --> 13:52.096
Or we'll get our throats cut.

13:52.098 --> 13:55.500
It seems that we're stuck here,
then, till francis finds us.

13:59.238 --> 14:01.840
Lady lola, my sympathies.

14:01.842 --> 14:05.076
On the matter of your dowry.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.578
How did you know about that?

14:06.580 --> 14:08.479
I'm the largest
depositor in that bank.

14:08.481 --> 14:11.082
I dine with the bankers often.
They're very good company.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.418
Fingers in every pie,
full of gossip.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.453
And very eager to keep me happy.

14:16.555 --> 14:17.555
There's still time.
I could use

14:17.557 --> 14:19.490
My influence on your behalf.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.259
In return for...?

14:21.261 --> 14:22.260
Tea.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.528
Tea.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.263
A cup... Or two.

14:25.265 --> 14:27.065
And the pleasure
of your company.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.533
I have extended

14:28.535 --> 14:30.001
The invitation before.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.636
Thank you, but I'm not sure

14:31.638 --> 14:33.538
It's a good idea.

14:33.540 --> 14:37.342
Well, I would never want
to press a lady.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.576
But...

14:38.578 --> 14:41.179
I do hope you reconsider

14:41.181 --> 14:43.615
The invitation.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.521
Mmm.

14:50.523 --> 14:53.124
Well, if we're to remain here,

14:53.126 --> 14:54.592
Perhaps we could
entertain each other.

14:54.594 --> 14:56.527
You can tell me why

14:56.529 --> 14:59.030
You need to get to beauvais.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.965
Oh.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.467
Oh, come.

15:02.469 --> 15:05.603
You heard I was going and you
insisted on riding with us.

15:05.605 --> 15:08.172
When you learned
my destination was elsewhere,

15:08.174 --> 15:10.174
You tried to force us back.

15:10.176 --> 15:12.210
I had no idea where
you were going.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.679
You mentioned it and I
recalled that I had heard

15:14.681 --> 15:17.382
There was a sacred
shrine in beauvais.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.617
There is.

15:19.619 --> 15:22.954
St. Wilgefortis.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.123
So, you had
an overwhelming need to pray

15:25.125 --> 15:27.525
To the patron saint
of bearded ladies?

15:30.529 --> 15:32.997
There's a physician...

15:32.999 --> 15:35.166
In beauvais who is celebrated

15:35.168 --> 15:38.136
For his knowledge
of women's problems.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.538
I assume you mean fertility,
because other than that,

15:40.540 --> 15:43.007
No man has an inkling
about women's problems.

15:43.009 --> 15:45.510
Oh, I spent ten years

15:45.512 --> 15:48.146
Suffering
the same uncertainty.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.315
And yet you torment me.

15:50.317 --> 15:53.084
All in good fun.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.385
But is francis
pressing you about it?

15:54.387 --> 15:57.522
He's admitted
that it bothers him.

15:57.524 --> 15:58.990
And he's become distant.

15:58.992 --> 16:00.558
He doesn't share
his problems with me

16:00.560 --> 16:02.593
Like he used to.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.463
If this goes on, what
will our marriage become?

16:05.465 --> 16:06.597
Normal.

16:06.599 --> 16:09.067
Especially for a royal.

16:09.069 --> 16:12.003
The crown changes everything.

16:12.005 --> 16:14.172
Oh, henry was the same way.

16:14.174 --> 16:17.342
Francis is not his father.

16:19.178 --> 16:20.678
Mary?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.480
I know you think
that I belittle your marriage

16:22.482 --> 16:24.015
By comparing it to mine.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.651
But that is not why I talk
to you the way that I do.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.619
I walked this road first.

16:28.621 --> 16:30.321
That's all.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.090
And I learned
that if you hold on

16:32.092 --> 16:34.592
To foolish
romantic expectations,

16:34.594 --> 16:36.327
It'll make it that much harder.

16:36.329 --> 16:40.164
You know that as a queen,
you have to put on an act.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.767
You can't always show
what's in your heart.

16:42.769 --> 16:45.003
Well, the same is true
for being a wife.

16:45.005 --> 16:48.172
If francis isn't sharing
his heart with you,

16:48.174 --> 16:50.641
Pretend you don't see.

16:50.643 --> 16:54.679
You'll withhold your own secrets
from him soon enough.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.482
I'm sorry, but you must
give up this dream.

16:57.484 --> 17:00.618
And accept the distance
between you.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.554
If you need solace...

17:03.556 --> 17:05.757
Find it elsewhere.

17:05.759 --> 17:08.760
In a separate life,
with your own work.

17:08.762 --> 17:11.029
And if you find that
the crown weighs too heavily,

17:11.031 --> 17:12.630
Well, then line it with velvet.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.265
That's what I do.

17:16.468 --> 17:18.469
Man:
Make way for the royal carriage!

17:18.471 --> 17:20.538
(horn blowing)
thank god.

17:26.745 --> 17:27.745
Man:
The queen of France

17:27.747 --> 17:30.615
And scotland!

17:30.617 --> 17:31.716
(crowd clapping)

17:31.718 --> 17:34.318
The king of France!

17:34.320 --> 17:35.787
Woman:
Your majesty!

17:35.789 --> 17:38.756
God, they're imposters!

17:47.399 --> 17:50.568
The plague has taken
a dread toll on our land.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.603
We've lost many brave

17:52.605 --> 17:54.839
Defenders of France,
and our nation's enemies

17:54.841 --> 17:57.241
See our weakness.

17:57.243 --> 18:00.711
They are massing
on our borders even now.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.547
We must have money
for troops!

18:02.549 --> 18:04.615
Give whatever you can!

18:04.617 --> 18:08.252
Give... Till it hurts!

18:14.393 --> 18:16.127
They believe him.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.795
Well, most of the country
has no idea

18:17.797 --> 18:20.164
What you or francis look like.

18:20.166 --> 18:22.100
Which makes it easy
for clever people

18:22.102 --> 18:24.168
Like this to take advantage.

18:24.170 --> 18:25.837
It is a masterful

18:25.839 --> 18:28.106
Exploitation of a weakness.

18:31.176 --> 18:33.511
Kenna:
<i>He wants you</i>
<i>to join him for tea?</i>

18:33.513 --> 18:34.879
Surely that can't mean "tea."

18:34.881 --> 18:36.848
No. Perhaps he wants to try

18:36.850 --> 18:39.217
And pry secrets from me
about francis.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.119
Or he might
simply want to seduce you.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.854
Either way, it's better
to stay far away from him.

18:42.856 --> 18:44.388
After all, last time we talked,

18:44.390 --> 18:46.657
You thought
he'd murdered his wives.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.527
I was wrong-- I learned
they died of natural causes.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.129
Did you learn that
from narcisse?

18:51.131 --> 18:53.397
All right, yes.

18:53.399 --> 18:55.900
But... You haven't spoken
to him, and I have.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.235
He seems very believable.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.703
Besides, if things got

18:58.705 --> 19:00.438
Out of hand, I could
simply walk out.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.907
He wouldn't dare try to
keep me there by force.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.342
I once thought I could
play a powerful man,

19:04.344 --> 19:06.777
And I lived to regret it.

19:06.779 --> 19:09.680
By the way, there's something
I haven't told you.

19:09.682 --> 19:12.650
He's the man from the journal
with the butterfly birthmark.

19:12.652 --> 19:15.153
He's the sublime lover?

19:15.155 --> 19:17.321
You didn't think
to share that with me?

19:17.323 --> 19:18.923
Well, this explains
your change of heart.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.892
Even more reason
to be cautious.

19:20.894 --> 19:22.894
If you're intrigued with him, it
just makes you more vulnerable.

19:22.896 --> 19:24.662
I'm not "intrigued."

19:24.664 --> 19:25.930
I have no interest
in narcisse.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.532
You're telling me
that that birthmark

19:27.534 --> 19:29.433
Doesn't make you
the slightest bit curious.

19:29.435 --> 19:30.902
No.

19:30.904 --> 19:33.171
It doesn't.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.341
Your majesty? Is it true
queen catherine once threw

19:37.343 --> 19:40.211
An entire family of hat-makers
into the dungeon?

19:40.213 --> 19:42.313
Woman:
Yes, I heard they cheated her,

19:42.315 --> 19:44.849
And she nailed their eyes open
so they'd always have to see

19:44.851 --> 19:47.218
Their deceitful bills!

19:47.220 --> 19:48.953
Where do these
stories come from?

19:48.955 --> 19:51.322
It was one man, and I only
stretched him a little.

19:51.324 --> 19:54.458
Nails, indeed.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.527
First, you should know
he was a terrible,

19:56.529 --> 19:58.296
Terrible hat-maker.

19:58.298 --> 20:00.231
False mary: And
outside the keep,

20:00.233 --> 20:02.466
There's a pond filled
with asses' milk,

20:02.468 --> 20:04.235
For the ladies of
the court to bathe in.

20:04.237 --> 20:05.369
(crowd gasping)

20:05.371 --> 20:07.305
She may have gone
too far with that one.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.207
Woman:
But then wouldn't passersby

20:09.209 --> 20:10.541
Be able to see the ladies...

20:10.543 --> 20:12.310
Well, naked?

20:12.312 --> 20:14.412
Yes.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.747
That is why

20:16.749 --> 20:19.483
All must turn their faces
away at such times.

20:19.485 --> 20:21.586
The penalty for

20:21.588 --> 20:23.988
Doing otherwise is death.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.591
Farmer:
I've been to the castle,
with my cart,

20:26.593 --> 20:28.426
And there's no pond
of asses' milk.

20:28.428 --> 20:29.994
(crowd murmuring)

20:32.731 --> 20:35.299
Hmm, the crowd's
about to turn ugly.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.236
You must have ridden
by the south keep.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.004
Everyone knows
it's the north keep

20:40.006 --> 20:41.906
That has a pond
of asses' milk.

20:41.908 --> 20:42.940
It's common knowledge.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.679
Hmm!

20:48.681 --> 20:50.781
(murmuring quietly)
why did you do that?

20:50.783 --> 20:52.016
She may be
an imposter,

20:52.018 --> 20:54.585
But she doesn't deserve
to die for it.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.921
Besides,
I have a plan.

20:59.558 --> 21:01.592
So this is really tea.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.427
Mmm.

21:03.429 --> 21:04.829
This house
and gardens...

21:04.831 --> 21:06.297
My sanctuary.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.332
But you keep chambers
at court as well.

21:08.334 --> 21:09.667
Yes.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.502
Court is what
I need sanctuary from.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.010
Care to try your skill?

21:19.012 --> 21:20.978
I've never even
held a bow.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.980
Let's see...

21:22.982 --> 21:24.448
You're
right-handed,

21:24.450 --> 21:27.318
So this one should do.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.686
Well, I might
be left-handed.

21:28.688 --> 21:29.654
Some people are.

21:29.656 --> 21:32.056
But not you.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.527
May I?

21:39.464 --> 21:41.332
This...

21:41.334 --> 21:43.901
Is the vambrace.

21:43.903 --> 21:46.537
It goes on the
non-dominant arm.

21:46.539 --> 21:48.506
Because

21:48.508 --> 21:52.777
Mistakes in this game...

21:53.745 --> 21:55.413
...Can hurt.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.356
You have good
instincts.

22:06.358 --> 22:07.491
No, no.

22:09.428 --> 22:11.028
You're too quick.

22:11.030 --> 22:14.565
The eye is more important
than the hand.

22:14.567 --> 22:17.501
See your target,

22:17.503 --> 22:19.837
Understand what
you're aiming for,

22:19.839 --> 22:22.340
Don't just
physically let fly.

22:23.442 --> 22:27.611
Now, sight
the center.

22:27.613 --> 22:30.715
The rest of the circles
are irrelevant.

22:37.689 --> 22:39.123
Congratulations.

22:39.125 --> 22:42.693
Of course, the beginning
is often promising.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.396
The trick is to keep
it going that way.

22:54.539 --> 22:56.073
Conde:
Mistress, there was an attack

22:56.075 --> 22:57.675
On the royal carriage,
just down the road.

22:57.677 --> 22:59.043
Did you happen
to see anything?

23:01.413 --> 23:02.747
You needn't be afraid
to speak with us.

23:02.749 --> 23:04.415
I am the king
of France.

23:04.417 --> 23:05.950
I give you
my word:

23:05.952 --> 23:07.051
No one will
harm you.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.086
You're not the king of France.

23:09.088 --> 23:11.889
The king of France
burned down my farm.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.891
We didn't give him
enough money, he said.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.927
He had to make
an example of some farms.

23:16.929 --> 23:18.763
You don't even look like him.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.166
Imposters.

23:22.168 --> 23:24.101
Doing evil in the name
of the royals.

23:24.103 --> 23:25.703
Leith:
Yeah, but why?

23:25.705 --> 23:27.037
Burning farms?

23:27.039 --> 23:28.406
What do they
get from them?

23:28.408 --> 23:29.974
Farmers can't
pay very much.

23:29.976 --> 23:31.108
It discredits
the king and queen.

23:31.110 --> 23:32.643
It undermines
the throne.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.111
Whoever's behind it,
we must hope

23:34.113 --> 23:35.913
That my wife and mother
are nowhere near them.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.581
This false king
and his men

23:37.583 --> 23:39.417
Clearly aren't afraid
of violence,

23:39.419 --> 23:40.551
And they can't afford to have

23:40.553 --> 23:41.919
Two sets of royals
in the same place.

23:41.921 --> 23:43.154
Francis and mary...

23:44.990 --> 23:46.557
I curse them.

23:46.559 --> 23:47.925
Let the castle burn

23:47.927 --> 23:49.827
And the queen writhe
in the smoke.

23:49.829 --> 23:53.497
Let her hive be
as barren as mine.

23:53.999 --> 23:55.800
No, gifford.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.504
Split up into
smaller groups.

24:00.506 --> 24:02.506
We must cover ground
as quickly as we can.

24:07.679 --> 24:09.513
The king and queen will
retire to the upper rooms

24:09.515 --> 24:10.915
To refresh themselves,

24:10.917 --> 24:13.150
Before continuing
their journey to amiens.

24:21.726 --> 24:23.894
Well, that's some
good news at least.

24:23.896 --> 24:26.197
Amiens is halfway
back to the castle.
Hmm.

24:26.199 --> 24:29.200
And the duke of amiens
is a good and loyal man.

24:29.202 --> 24:31.669
He will see us safely
the rest of the way home.

24:37.742 --> 24:40.211
Her majesty wishes
to be alone.

24:40.213 --> 24:43.080
No, it's all right.

24:43.082 --> 24:45.850
You can let her in.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.685
Your majesty,

24:47.687 --> 24:49.787
My mother and I
are lady's maids,

24:49.789 --> 24:52.256
Out of work,
due to the plague.

24:52.258 --> 24:54.191
We're trying to make
our way back home,

24:54.193 --> 24:55.793
And we wished
to beg you

24:55.795 --> 24:57.561
For a ride
to amiens.

24:57.563 --> 24:59.063
I have always wanted
to be a lady's maid!

24:59.065 --> 25:01.065
Have you served in
many great houses?

25:01.067 --> 25:03.000
To be a lady's maid?

25:03.002 --> 25:05.035
But you're the
queen of France.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.171
Of course.

25:07.173 --> 25:08.239
I meant that when I imagine

25:08.241 --> 25:09.974
Being one of the common people,

25:09.976 --> 25:13.110
I think being a lady's maid
would be fun.

25:19.284 --> 25:21.552
(grunts)
you know, don't you?

25:23.955 --> 25:26.590
Is that why you're here?

25:26.592 --> 25:28.526
I just made up
that pond of asses' milk.

25:28.528 --> 25:30.127
Why did you back me up?

25:30.129 --> 25:31.896
Oh! Do you want money?

25:31.898 --> 25:33.931
No, I just didn't want
to see you hurt.

25:36.301 --> 25:38.602
(laughs)
daughter,

25:38.604 --> 25:40.604
This sensible
woman knows better

25:40.606 --> 25:42.907
Than to expect
disinterested generosity

25:42.909 --> 25:44.275
From the world, right?

25:44.277 --> 25:46.310
We must tell her

25:46.312 --> 25:47.645
The truth.

25:47.647 --> 25:51.982
Like you, we are
professional deceivers.

25:51.984 --> 25:53.851
Tricksters.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.753
Beguilers of
those poor folk

25:55.755 --> 25:58.155
Who never leave
their tiny plot of land.

25:58.157 --> 26:00.558
Oh, they long for entertainment.

26:00.560 --> 26:01.926
And we give it to them, eh?

26:01.928 --> 26:03.327
Take their money in return.

26:03.329 --> 26:04.962
Oh, now,
of course,

26:04.964 --> 26:06.830
You got to this
territory first,

26:06.832 --> 26:09.633
And we wouldn't
dream of intruding.

26:09.635 --> 26:12.269
My daughter plays

26:12.271 --> 26:14.805
Mary,
queen of scots,

26:14.807 --> 26:16.574
And I am

26:16.576 --> 26:19.043
Catherine de medici.

26:21.580 --> 26:24.782
Well, aren't you a little short
to play queens?

26:24.784 --> 26:26.116
(chuckles dryly)

26:26.118 --> 26:27.918
Nobody cares how tall you are

26:27.920 --> 26:29.253
When you're wearing
one of these.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.658
Oh! Oh...

26:34.660 --> 26:36.360
I have
never seen

26:36.362 --> 26:39.663
Such beautiful work
done with paste jewels!

26:39.665 --> 26:42.666
You can have it...

26:42.668 --> 26:44.168
If you take
us to amiens.

26:44.170 --> 26:46.303
All right.

26:46.305 --> 26:49.006
(giggles)

26:50.375 --> 26:52.309
I'm sorry,

26:52.311 --> 26:54.111
That's not enough.

26:54.113 --> 26:55.813
It's all we have.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.848
I beg your
mercy...
Your older girl

26:57.850 --> 27:00.317
Has a pleasing look.

27:00.319 --> 27:01.719
Do you add her to the pile?

27:04.656 --> 27:06.056
No.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.391
Burn it all!

27:07.393 --> 27:10.127
(horse neighs)

27:11.363 --> 27:12.796
What...

27:17.802 --> 27:19.403
Mmm, I am an
experienced

27:19.405 --> 27:20.738
Actor, you know.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.806
Mmm, you should've heard
the applause

27:22.808 --> 27:24.408
When I played guinevere.

27:24.410 --> 27:27.044
But I thought women
weren't allowed on the stage.

27:27.046 --> 27:28.646
Well, we aren't,

27:28.648 --> 27:30.280
And that's why I couldn't
make a living.

27:30.282 --> 27:31.749
But then

27:31.751 --> 27:33.217
I found a lover,

27:33.219 --> 27:34.351
And he found me
this touring work,

27:34.353 --> 27:36.086
And it's been easy ever since.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.354
People just give us
their best food and wine,

27:37.356 --> 27:38.789
And ask nothing in return.

27:38.791 --> 27:40.157
(giggles)

27:40.159 --> 27:41.759
I love being a queen.

27:43.128 --> 27:44.194
(door opens)

27:47.932 --> 27:49.400
What are you telling
these people?

27:49.402 --> 27:51.168
It's all right, they're like us.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.270
And I promised
that we would

27:53.272 --> 27:54.738
Take them
to amiens.

27:54.740 --> 27:56.674
Would you mind waiting outside?

27:56.676 --> 27:58.809
I would like to have a word
with my queen.

28:02.313 --> 28:04.748
(whispers):
Keep them from leaving.

28:17.328 --> 28:18.395
Let us pass.

28:18.397 --> 28:20.764
(slap, woman whimpers)

28:25.904 --> 28:28.405
â™ª

28:31.710 --> 28:33.877
This music's
charming,

28:33.879 --> 28:35.479
But it would be
much more charming

28:35.481 --> 28:37.414
If you were dancing to it.

28:37.416 --> 28:40.384
What do you want from me?

28:40.386 --> 28:42.920
I want to help with your dowry.

28:42.922 --> 28:45.122
I could also help with some
other suggestions, too.

28:45.124 --> 28:47.324
For instance, this would be

28:47.326 --> 28:49.293
A beautiful night for a bath.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.061
A bath?

28:51.063 --> 28:52.463
You can see the stars

28:52.465 --> 28:54.298
From the chamber
in the north keep.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.934
It's a lovely room
to bathe in,

28:56.936 --> 28:58.135
And though the window is large,

28:58.137 --> 29:00.137
It's not overlooked
by anybody...

29:00.139 --> 29:01.939
Except the parapet opposite.

29:01.941 --> 29:04.041
But hardly anyone
ever goes there.

29:04.043 --> 29:07.111
Are you seriously,

29:07.113 --> 29:08.345
Seriously suggesting

29:08.347 --> 29:10.047
That you want to watch me bathe

29:10.049 --> 29:12.015
In exchange for getting
my dowry back?

29:12.017 --> 29:14.918
Well, that is quite a leap.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.020
I would never speak so bluntly
in front of a lady.

29:17.022 --> 29:19.056
I'd simply say

29:19.058 --> 29:20.891
That midnight

29:20.893 --> 29:22.760
Is a very fine time for a bath.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.962
The world's so quiet then,
you could almost believe

29:24.964 --> 29:27.264
You're the only one in it.

29:28.933 --> 29:32.402
I'll leave you to consider
the advantages.

29:39.344 --> 29:41.545
Innkeeper:
<i>Looking for the queen?</i>
<i>She's upstairs.</i>

29:41.547 --> 29:42.946
Your majesties.

29:42.948 --> 29:45.115
Thank heavens
you're all right.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.784
Armsman gifford,
isn't it?

29:46.786 --> 29:48.051
Gifford:
My lady.

29:48.053 --> 29:51.054
Half of northern France
for you both.

29:51.056 --> 29:53.190
They said downstairs the queen
was here, but I wasn't sure.

29:53.192 --> 29:55.292
Where is king
francis?

29:55.294 --> 29:57.161
Well, he's searching
eastward of here.

29:57.163 --> 29:59.062
But I saw a carriage outside.

29:59.064 --> 30:01.064
I'll borrow it
and take you both
back to the castle

30:01.066 --> 30:02.533
And send messengers
to let him know

30:02.535 --> 30:03.967
You're
all right.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.302
No, that carriage
belongs to imposters.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.171
They're pretending to be
the king and queen.

30:07.173 --> 30:09.439
And they are in there now
and they have my crown.

30:09.441 --> 30:12.209
My lady,
why don't you wait downstairs?

30:12.211 --> 30:14.411
And we'll rout
these mountebanks fast enough

30:14.413 --> 30:16.213
And leave them
with the local magistrate.

30:16.215 --> 30:17.815
Don't arrest the woman.

30:17.817 --> 30:20.017
I want her to come
to the castle with us.

30:20.019 --> 30:22.119
Your majesty.

30:22.121 --> 30:24.121
Take her back to the castle?

30:24.123 --> 30:28.158
I'm sure I can find her a
position as a lady's maid.

30:34.165 --> 30:36.400
What did you tell them?

30:36.402 --> 30:38.001
Did you talk about me?

30:38.003 --> 30:39.269
Tell who?

30:39.271 --> 30:40.504
Oh, you fool, you don't know

30:40.506 --> 30:41.872
Who you were entertaining?

30:41.874 --> 30:42.973
That was the real

30:42.975 --> 30:45.342
Queen mary and catherine!

30:47.212 --> 30:49.213
False mary:
Mary and catherine?

30:49.215 --> 30:51.081
Uh...

30:52.016 --> 30:53.250
Come on!

30:53.252 --> 30:55.619
I didn't say anything.

30:55.621 --> 30:57.120
Neither did jenny.

30:57.122 --> 30:59.189
No names, I swear.

31:04.062 --> 31:05.963
Good.

31:07.899 --> 31:09.600
(grunting)

31:10.535 --> 31:12.202
(gasps)

31:12.204 --> 31:14.171
(men grunting)

31:23.514 --> 31:25.549
(sobbing)

31:25.551 --> 31:26.583
(shushing)

31:26.585 --> 31:28.118
It's all right.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.020
(shushing)

31:33.391 --> 31:35.525
Not a word,
my love, hmm?

31:35.527 --> 31:37.461
Come here.

31:37.463 --> 31:39.463
Not a word.

31:39.465 --> 31:41.965
We might both come
out of this alive.

31:41.967 --> 31:43.233
Come on.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.936
All right, you,
clean up this room.

31:45.938 --> 31:47.638
You, come with me
to white horse hill.

31:47.640 --> 31:50.540
You can help bury
the two queens.

31:50.542 --> 31:53.010
There must be no trace
of this enterprise.

31:57.015 --> 31:59.149
(crying)

32:00.618 --> 32:02.686
We should have hit
the main road by now.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.221
Something's wrong.

32:04.223 --> 32:06.023
What is it?
It's all right.

32:06.025 --> 32:07.357
You can tell me.
I'm a friend.

32:07.359 --> 32:08.926
No.

32:08.928 --> 32:11.929
I am also your queen,
and I command you to speak!

32:11.931 --> 32:14.331
Oh, god! He killed roger.

32:14.333 --> 32:16.300
Who's roger?

32:16.302 --> 32:18.936
Francis, francis!
Roger's francis.

32:20.371 --> 32:23.373
He told me to keep quiet.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.676
But when he sees that I
can't keep myself together,

32:25.678 --> 32:27.577
He's going to kill me, too.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.179
Catherine:
Kill you, too?

32:29.181 --> 32:30.580
The false king wasn't
your lover?

32:30.582 --> 32:32.182
It's armsman gifford.

32:32.184 --> 32:33.951
Catherine:
The guard who rescued us?

32:33.953 --> 32:35.552
Mary:
He's the one who recruited you.

32:35.554 --> 32:38.121
What are we going to do?

32:38.123 --> 32:39.723
He's not taking us
back to the castle.

32:39.725 --> 32:42.059
If I've learned one thing

32:42.061 --> 32:45.195
At french court, it's
always keep a dagger on you.

32:47.366 --> 32:50.133
Oh, you say that
so hopefully now.

32:50.135 --> 32:52.102
But sadly, it's not.

32:52.104 --> 32:53.403
I don't carry poison everywhere!

32:53.405 --> 32:55.539
I might accidentally
kill myself.

32:55.541 --> 32:58.375
Besides, gifford and his men
are armed with swords.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.243
We'd never get even close
enough to use these.

33:00.245 --> 33:02.346
He might let her
get close enough.

33:02.348 --> 33:04.514
What about the other guard?

33:04.516 --> 33:07.217
Once we take out gifford,
it'll be our three to his one.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.186
And we'll have gifford's sword.
It's the only chance we've got.

33:09.188 --> 33:12.189
No, no, please! I'm a coward.

33:12.191 --> 33:15.025
Good. Cowards want to live.

33:15.027 --> 33:16.326
Now...

33:16.328 --> 33:18.261
The quickest... Hey!

33:18.263 --> 33:20.497
The quickest route
to the heart is through

33:20.499 --> 33:22.432
The fifth and sixth rib.
Aah!

33:23.434 --> 33:24.568
(grunts)

33:26.771 --> 33:28.405
Take it.

33:28.407 --> 33:30.507
Mary:
It's our only chance
of survival.

33:43.488 --> 33:44.788
What is it?
Why have we stopped?

33:44.790 --> 33:48.058
Mary, queen of scots.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.359
Did you really think

33:49.361 --> 33:50.460
You could wear the english

33:50.462 --> 33:52.396
Coat of arms,
and not pay a price?

33:54.265 --> 33:57.534
Elizabeth is behind
the imposters.

33:57.536 --> 34:00.037
You as good as
told the world

34:00.039 --> 34:02.105
You're the rightful
queen of England.

34:02.107 --> 34:04.074
Well?

34:04.076 --> 34:06.109
You've earned
your punishment.

34:06.111 --> 34:08.545
This was a cheap way
for her to give it to you.

34:08.547 --> 34:11.314
Finance a few needy actors,
destroy your credibility...

34:11.316 --> 34:13.784
And your husband's.

34:13.786 --> 34:16.119
She paid me well
as her agent.

34:16.121 --> 34:18.155
Wonder how much more
she would reward me

34:18.157 --> 34:20.390
For ridding her
of her rival?

34:20.392 --> 34:22.325
Who'd believe I'd find

34:22.327 --> 34:24.327
The queen of scots here alone?

34:24.329 --> 34:25.495
Not a single guard.

34:25.497 --> 34:27.164
Not entirely alone.

34:27.166 --> 34:29.199
(grunts)

34:29.201 --> 34:30.634
(screaming)

34:33.771 --> 34:36.339
I'll see you bitches in hell
for making me do this.

34:36.341 --> 34:38.208
God, please, no!
You stupid...

34:38.210 --> 34:41.178
Stupid girl.

34:41.180 --> 34:42.779
(gasps)

34:42.781 --> 34:44.214
Wait!

34:44.216 --> 34:45.749
Think. Think!

34:45.751 --> 34:47.484
Before you do
anything else.

34:47.486 --> 34:48.518
You could make
so much more money

34:48.520 --> 34:50.420
If you held us for ransom.

34:50.422 --> 34:52.289
You could bankrupt France.

34:52.291 --> 34:53.824
My son will pay any price

34:53.826 --> 34:55.625
For his mother and his wife.

34:55.627 --> 34:57.594
Gifford:
I don't trust you.

35:00.131 --> 35:03.600
Stay back! It's poison!

35:03.602 --> 35:05.402
(horse neighs)
(gifford grunts)

35:05.404 --> 35:07.504
Oh!

35:07.506 --> 35:08.805
No!

35:10.475 --> 35:12.542
(horse neighs)

35:12.544 --> 35:14.277
More of his friends
are coming.

35:15.546 --> 35:17.380
Wait, no! It's francis!

35:17.382 --> 35:19.216
Whoa.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.553
Conde:
We found a guardsman

35:23.555 --> 35:25.589
Throwing bodies into
a ditch behind a tavern.

35:25.591 --> 35:28.391
He confessed, but he wasn't
sure you'd still be alive.

35:29.594 --> 35:31.294
Oh, thank god.

35:36.801 --> 35:38.802
Poor child.

35:43.574 --> 35:45.609
Well.

35:48.546 --> 35:52.149
My dear, never give up
a crown to anybody.

36:03.728 --> 36:05.862
Mary...

36:05.864 --> 36:07.164
I'll retire to our chambers.

36:07.166 --> 36:08.798
I'm very tired.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.600
Of course.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.443
You're a fool.

36:20.445 --> 36:21.678
This is none of
your business.

36:21.680 --> 36:23.713
Mary risked her life today.

36:23.715 --> 36:26.383
And she was out there because
she wanted to please you.

36:26.385 --> 36:28.752
By seeing a physician
who could help her have a baby.

36:28.754 --> 36:32.189
I know that desperation.

36:32.191 --> 36:34.391
Your pressure isn't helping.

36:34.393 --> 36:36.493
I was reminded today

36:36.495 --> 36:38.528
She's a good fighter to have

36:38.530 --> 36:39.930
When your back's
against the wall.

36:39.932 --> 36:43.266
Whatever is going on...

36:43.268 --> 36:44.267
Trust her.

36:44.269 --> 36:46.236
Be honest.

36:46.238 --> 36:48.538
If you don't, she'll end up
a thousand miles away from you,

36:48.540 --> 36:51.474
Playing her role out of duty.

36:51.476 --> 36:52.742
And you would care?

36:52.744 --> 36:54.744
She has a childlike belief

36:54.746 --> 36:56.713
That a woman should
trust her husband.

36:56.715 --> 36:59.382
I find...

36:59.384 --> 37:02.319
I wish it were true.

37:07.658 --> 37:10.393
(owl hooting in distance)

37:20.805 --> 37:24.641
â™ª what'll it be

37:24.643 --> 37:28.478
â™ª now, mr. Mole?

37:28.480 --> 37:31.348
â™ª whisper sloth in curls...

37:31.350 --> 37:33.683
You're right.

37:33.685 --> 37:36.319
It is a beautiful night
for a bath.

37:36.321 --> 37:39.789
So I offered
the use of the tub

37:39.791 --> 37:42.659
And five gold pieces to
the servant who does my laundry.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.894
Ah.
I warned her
that someone might look.

37:44.896 --> 37:46.830
She said that
for five gold pieces,

37:46.832 --> 37:48.632
The entire castle could watch.

37:48.634 --> 37:50.000
Well played.

37:50.002 --> 37:51.534
(laughs)

37:51.536 --> 37:53.370
And I should tell you
that I've already

37:53.372 --> 37:55.372
Stopped the transfer
of your dowry to hungary.

37:55.374 --> 37:57.574
It's yours.

37:57.576 --> 37:59.509
And I would be honored
to be of any further

37:59.511 --> 38:01.444
Service in the future.

38:02.546 --> 38:04.814
And I want you to know that

38:04.816 --> 38:06.416
I do understand.

38:06.418 --> 38:07.951
"understand"?

38:07.953 --> 38:10.320
Why you wanted your dowry back.

38:10.322 --> 38:13.490
With it, you can stay
or go as you wish.

38:13.492 --> 38:15.659
It means you haven't
surrendered to life at court.

38:15.661 --> 38:17.661
You can still make
your own decisions.

38:17.663 --> 38:19.963
Perhaps find love again.

38:19.965 --> 38:22.565
Get married.

38:22.567 --> 38:24.968
I have the same wish.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.570
Most people seem to think

38:27.572 --> 38:29.572
That women shouldn't
have such freedom.

38:29.574 --> 38:33.510
Ah, but you clearly have not
listened to those people.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.378
For a woman

38:35.380 --> 38:38.615
Impatient with court ways,

38:38.617 --> 38:42.652
You are becoming quite
an intriguing game player.

38:42.654 --> 38:45.655
"the beginning is
often promising.

38:45.657 --> 38:46.990
"the trick

38:46.992 --> 38:48.892
Is to go on that way."

38:57.735 --> 38:59.869
Seeing you safe today...

38:59.871 --> 39:02.572
I could not have
borne losing you.

39:02.574 --> 39:04.908
I want you to know
that I didn't

39:04.910 --> 39:07.477
Mean those words I said.

39:07.479 --> 39:09.846
I didn't even mean them
in the moment.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.748
I was desperate.

39:11.750 --> 39:15.452
I was afraid for you.

39:15.454 --> 39:18.421
God, mary, I can't live
like this, with us so far apart.

39:18.423 --> 39:20.490
Then stop shutting me out.

39:20.492 --> 39:23.026
Tell me why you're so afraid.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.561
Whatever it is,

39:24.563 --> 39:26.629
I will fight at your side!

39:27.765 --> 39:30.033
You would, wouldn't you?

39:30.035 --> 39:32.569
You'd fight to the end.

39:35.673 --> 39:37.807
There's no need to be
so ferocious, you know.

39:37.809 --> 39:40.677
I was just...
Feeling the pressures

39:40.679 --> 39:41.678
Of being a king.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.646
Naturally they take a toll.

39:43.648 --> 39:45.915
I'm sorry.

39:45.917 --> 39:48.718
Whatever happens,
I'll never leave you,

39:48.720 --> 39:50.820
Never betray you.

39:50.822 --> 39:52.989
Isn't lack of honesty
a betrayal?

39:52.991 --> 39:56.426
You must believe
that I'll fix this.

39:56.428 --> 39:58.828
I'll end this distance
between us, I swear.

40:00.598 --> 40:02.565
You do believe me, don't you?

40:06.003 --> 40:09.839
Of course I believe you.

40:09.841 --> 40:11.775
You mean it?

40:11.777 --> 40:13.143
You're not just

40:13.145 --> 40:15.812
Acting the part of a dutiful
wife like my mother had to?

40:15.814 --> 40:17.981
I don't want that.
No.

40:17.983 --> 40:20.150
That will never be us.
