WEBVTT

00:01.004 --> 00:03.559
You burned my house down. I don't care what you like.

00:03.560 --> 00:05.839
My sister had a score to settle in the tavern.

00:07.960 --> 00:11.879
John Kelly, ready for your next big fight?

00:11.880 --> 00:13.879
Just a friendly reminder that the walls

00:13.880 --> 00:16.039
and black men have ears.

00:16.040 --> 00:18.239
Resist from within and they cannot hurt you.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.439
An escape!

00:22.200 --> 00:24.839
Sophia's married to the footman.

00:24.840 --> 00:26.439
She says she's happy.

00:26.440 --> 00:29.439
You've brought me into a molly house.

00:29.440 --> 00:33.439
A Wells in my house? There's only one place left.

00:33.440 --> 00:37.079
As you are in such dire straits.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.399
You can have your dirty money

00:38.400 --> 00:40.839
and you never come near me, my girls,

00:40.840 --> 00:42.799
or my family ever again.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.319
Now fly away home.

00:44.320 --> 00:46.639
You win.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.039
How would you grow this?

00:48.040 --> 00:49.759
You don't own the floor you stand on.

00:49.760 --> 00:50.839
You need to invest.

00:50.840 --> 00:51.999
How do you recon to do that?

00:52.000 --> 00:53.999
America.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.440
There's land for sale.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.840 --> 01:42.490
It's definitely her.

01:44.360 --> 01:45.719
What do you think she wants?

01:58.240 --> 02:01.079
So even hell spat you out?

02:01.080 --> 02:03.519
It seems hell has been visited on this house.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.239
No one died, if that's what you're hoping.

02:05.240 --> 02:06.599
I'm here to see Charlotte.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.719
You'll have to crawl through me first.

02:08.720 --> 02:12.799
Then please send her my love.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.199
You can change the face you present to the world,

02:15.200 --> 02:17.345
but you can't change your putrid soul.

02:18.600 --> 02:19.778
Stay away!

02:36.200 --> 02:38.039
Oh, don't stop!

03:09.320 --> 03:12.359
Talk with me.
I think it's best I don't.

03:12.360 --> 03:16.919
There's the sky to observe, the weather to deliberate.

03:16.920 --> 03:19.119
I'm not your chat mate.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.359
Don't spoil it.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.599
Ooh, good lass.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.279
Oh, yes.

03:46.280 --> 03:47.439
Nearly there.

03:56.520 --> 03:57.879
Sorry.

04:09.720 --> 04:12.479
We'll fit a fair few in tonight.

04:12.480 --> 04:15.279
I'm gonna make you a mint.

04:15.280 --> 04:17.639
I got my money back. Tonight's for you.

04:18.920 --> 04:22.039
What of repairs, loss of earnings?

04:22.040 --> 04:23.919
I get to make my champion. That's all I need.

04:23.920 --> 04:26.079
We'll split the takings then.

04:26.080 --> 04:27.679
We'll see.

04:27.680 --> 04:29.159
I'll fight you if I have to.

04:29.160 --> 04:30.679
Come on then.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.479
Watch. There you go...ooh!

04:39.360 --> 04:41.039
Is this to be the main event?

04:41.040 --> 04:42.759
Your Ladyship.

04:42.760 --> 04:45.159
Looking forward to shaking St. James from his slumber?

04:45.160 --> 04:46.479
Very much.

04:46.480 --> 04:48.799
I want the world to hear about tonight,

04:48.800 --> 04:51.079
especially Sophia.

04:51.080 --> 04:53.852
I want her to know that there's no scandal so great

04:53.853 --> 04:55.519
that she can't come home.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.639
There might be if any constables pay us a visit.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.839
What can they do?

05:00.840 --> 05:02.759
I'm a member of the nobility

05:02.760 --> 05:06.000
hosting a private party for a few friends.

05:07.080 --> 05:09.799
This way, madam.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.879
Lady Isabella Fitzwilliam,

05:11.880 --> 05:15.119
I followed you and your daughter's adventures intently,

05:15.120 --> 05:16.839
such bravado.

05:16.840 --> 05:18.974
I see you lack for none, madam.

05:19.600 --> 05:22.719
Elizabeth Harvey my new business partner.

05:22.720 --> 05:25.759
And friend.

05:25.760 --> 05:27.599
This is my Pa.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.039
Ah!

05:30.040 --> 05:32.919
Well you, sir, are a very well-made man.

05:32.920 --> 05:35.209
She's in gentlemen's clothing.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.974
Aren't we all?

05:36.975 --> 05:38.421
You must be Charlotte.

05:38.422 --> 05:40.515
I have silks that would light up London

05:40.516 --> 05:42.469
were you to lend your radiance to them.

05:42.470 --> 05:44.813
Is now really the time to be flogging our wares?

05:44.814 --> 05:46.757
It's always the time.

05:46.758 --> 05:50.141
Lucy tells me that you're master of ceremonies this evening.

05:50.142 --> 05:52.765
I have just the jacket for you.

05:52.766 --> 05:54.606
Huh.

05:55.720 --> 05:57.879
So be keen but not too keen.

05:57.880 --> 06:00.719
Mm, make them fret that we'll walk away.

06:00.720 --> 06:02.159
Oh.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.879
It's the only way to buy land.

06:03.880 --> 06:06.599
Just like handling a cull then.

06:06.600 --> 06:10.359
No, Emily, he's a respectable businessman.

06:10.360 --> 06:12.399
Which means we can't take a whore with us.

06:12.400 --> 06:14.399
Fuck off. I'm the conduit.

06:14.400 --> 06:17.479
Half-wit.
Where have you been?

06:17.480 --> 06:19.880
Sliding his pole up Charlotte Wells.

06:23.840 --> 06:25.600
She rivals Shakespeare for her tales.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.559
Let's go.

06:29.560 --> 06:30.720
Emily, you're staying here.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.879
I'll, uh, tell you all about it, puppy.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.959
Oh, don't puppy me.
Oh.

06:39.960 --> 06:43.319
And you can knead your own doughy dick from now on.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.318
What have you done to your face?

07:01.040 --> 07:03.039
You look like one of my dollies.

07:03.040 --> 07:04.639
Please don't.

07:04.640 --> 07:08.239
Best get used to a stranger's touch, my dear.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.728
I like her. She has spark.

07:21.400 --> 07:22.799
I don't want to stay here.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.159
Unfortunately, we have no choice.

07:25.160 --> 07:27.039
But I can help.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.400
I'm ready to earn.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.720
Wonderful girl.

07:35.760 --> 07:37.625
If you will trust me,

07:37.626 --> 07:41.279
I have a plan to protect you from the paws of humdrum men.

07:41.280 --> 07:43.119
But, Mrs.May...
Oh, forget that ghoul.

07:43.120 --> 07:46.359
You're far more precious than to be spent on mere subsistence.

07:46.360 --> 07:51.360
When the time is right, you will earn an instant fortune.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.720
Nothing less.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.839
Is there truth to Emily's words?

08:02.840 --> 08:04.799
That whore jabbers drivel.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.879
You're a fool for listening.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.519
I want to brain Charlotte Wells,

08:09.520 --> 08:11.119
not bed her.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.239
All right, steady. There you go.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.079
Say hello to Hardwick.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.519
Don't let my pa see that.

08:28.840 --> 08:32.039
Didn't I say it would fit? I have an eye.

08:32.039 --> 08:34.879
And the color becomes you.

08:34.880 --> 08:37.438
How much?
It's a gift.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.759
Excuse me, Miss Harvey.

08:40.760 --> 08:43.679
The man won't give you credit, says he doesn't know you.

08:43.679 --> 08:45.439
Oh, for goodness sake.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.359
He knows me. Put the account in my name.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.960
Thank you, Lucy.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.563
The account goes in her name.

08:53.564 --> 08:55.959
Thank Mrs.Harvey for me, but I can't accept this from her.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.919
It's my gift.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.280
Can't a daughter treat her pa from time to time?

09:01.400 --> 09:03.239
I'll treasure it.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.480
What is this place, really?

09:09.240 --> 09:12.359
I told you, it's a tailors

09:12.360 --> 09:14.839
where I'm offered as an extra frill.

09:14.840 --> 09:17.919
It works for me, and it works for them.

09:17.920 --> 09:21.039
A bientÃ´t, Mr.North.

09:21.040 --> 09:23.439
Love you, Pa.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.159
I don't think that helped.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.239
Lydia Quigley can't hurt me.

09:35.240 --> 09:37.560
I have no secrets anymore.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.840
Don't you?

09:42.640 --> 09:44.359
She can find weakness in a rock.

09:44.360 --> 09:45.919
Don't underestimate her.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.919
I've no space left in my head for that vampire.

09:47.920 --> 09:48.999
Make some.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.119
She was asking for you.

09:50.120 --> 09:51.559
What can she do?

09:51.560 --> 09:53.683
Charles has vanished. Her house is gone. She has nothing.

09:53.684 --> 09:55.764
A cut snake's more likely to strike.

09:59.560 --> 10:01.760
She needs a dress, shoes.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.919
You said yourself she has spark.

10:07.920 --> 10:10.440
You should consider it an investment.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.240
Very well.

10:17.760 --> 10:21.359
But get her rutting. Don't be soft on her...

10:21.360 --> 10:22.879
No, no, no, no, no, no.

10:22.880 --> 10:25.120
Or she'll go the way of Charles and Charlotte.

10:30.840 --> 10:35.720
If you don't find her culls, I will.

10:38.160 --> 10:39.559
I'm dead.

10:39.560 --> 10:41.599
Died Friday last.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.319
Miss Catherine Bottomley,

10:43.320 --> 10:46.799
step-daughter of Reverend Bottomley of Barford,

10:46.800 --> 10:49.879
succumbed to a fever caught tending the poor.

10:49.880 --> 10:53.799
Your own family have written your obituary.

10:53.800 --> 10:57.119
Ooh, monsters!

10:57.120 --> 10:59.759
This is good news.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.479
How?

11:01.480 --> 11:04.919
I'm dead to my family, about to become a whore,

11:04.920 --> 11:07.679
and living in the home of a merciless bawd.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.159
They won't seek you out.

11:11.160 --> 11:13.319
They can't send you back to Bedlam.

11:13.320 --> 11:15.079
You're free.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.399
This is it.

11:38.240 --> 11:41.319
We're looking for a Mr.Jonas Young.

11:41.320 --> 11:42.799
You found him.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.337
Sorry to intrude on your breakfast,

11:44.338 --> 11:47.399
but we're the types of fellows who spy an opportunity and act.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.639
We're here to buy the land.

11:56.640 --> 11:57.999
You don't need to deal with anyone else.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.026
This is an ambush, gentlemen.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.679
We only arrived last night.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.679
We're yet to wash the sea salt from our skin.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.369
Well, you sell to us, you needn't unpack.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.876
Company so soon?

12:14.800 --> 12:16.240
I must look half dead.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.079
What do you know of America?

12:29.080 --> 12:32.039
We fought the French there, spilled blood on that land.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.959
And now we want to own a piece of it.

12:33.960 --> 12:35.279
Will you work it yourselves?

12:35.280 --> 12:37.359
We plan to parcel most of it up,

12:37.360 --> 12:40.039
sell it on to men who'll bring it to life.

12:40.040 --> 12:43.599
As the Good Book says, in the parable of the talents,

12:43.600 --> 12:44.919
Spread your wealth.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.592
It's a fine plan.

12:46.593 --> 12:49.239
Where is the money to finance it coming from?

12:49.240 --> 12:51.279
I'm in pistols and muskets.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.999
My brother and I are in the tavern trade.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.080
All aspects of the tavern trade?

12:57.080 --> 12:59.480
Food, drink, and lodging, madam.

13:00.640 --> 13:02.160
What about company?

13:05.258 --> 13:07.258
There are always people to talk to.

13:09.240 --> 13:12.199
My wife is an astute business woman.

13:12.200 --> 13:15.000
I wouldn't make a move without her approval.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.639
We admire your enterprise, gentlemen,

13:19.640 --> 13:21.800
but we need to see the color of your cash.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.559
"I have no secrets anymore",

13:29.560 --> 13:33.239
she says with a whore languishing in her bed.

13:33.240 --> 13:36.239
Why must you always speak the awkward truth?

13:36.240 --> 13:37.720
Someone has to.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.699
Very well.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.360
Where you're concerned, I'm a shameless liar.

13:55.320 --> 13:56.600
What is it?

13:59.096 --> 14:00.636
It's my brother.

14:02.840 --> 14:05.080
Neither of them look like him.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.979
It's his way of telling me that he's returned.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.480
I'm being warned.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.400
Damn him.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.919
I want to.
You are not my servant.

14:25.920 --> 14:29.159
But I am. You bought me.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.179
My money buys your secrecy.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.379
In this room, I want a lover,

14:36.480 --> 14:37.680
a match.

15:04.280 --> 15:07.799
I can suggest more edifying material, should you wish.

15:07.800 --> 15:12.119
Hmm. I like to read about myself, the stories they make up.

15:14.120 --> 15:15.280
You?

15:17.680 --> 15:20.039
It's Mr.Croft, isn't it?

15:20.040 --> 15:21.759
I've heard you speak.

15:21.760 --> 15:24.999
If I could just pay for my fitting.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.021
Certainly.

15:26.654 --> 15:28.211
Five guineas.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.400
For your discretion.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.320
I like those boys.

15:52.640 --> 15:54.759
Clawed their way up from the gutter, like me.

15:54.760 --> 15:56.612
They thought you were religious.

15:57.840 --> 16:00.520
If only they knew.

16:04.800 --> 16:06.679
I need to find my children.

16:06.680 --> 16:08.279
I know.

16:08.280 --> 16:10.399
And I'm coming with you.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.978
I'll wait outside, wherever, but you cannot walk the streets alone.

16:14.720 --> 16:16.879
I know these streets better than I know myself.

16:16.880 --> 16:19.599
But you may be recognized.

16:20.045 --> 16:21.925
With me, you're safe.

16:23.240 --> 16:24.840
You're Mrs.Margaret Young.

16:44.040 --> 16:48.279
Say your lines, meet their eyes,

16:48.280 --> 16:51.599
hold yourself like a queen...

16:51.600 --> 16:53.600
And you will be a sensation.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.599
Ready?
Ready.

17:02.760 --> 17:08.878
Behold Venus, born this day full-grown,

17:08.880 --> 17:13.638
goddess of all forms of love.

17:28.200 --> 17:31.559
Since I have hemmed thee here

17:31.560 --> 17:35.839
within the circuit of this ivory pale,

17:35.840 --> 17:39.439
I'll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer.

17:44.760 --> 17:49.719
Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale.

17:49.720 --> 17:54.679
Graze on my lips, and if those hills be dry,

17:54.680 --> 17:59.639
stray lower where the pleasant fountains lie.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.839
You have something for me?

18:15.840 --> 18:18.319
I simply love macaroons.

18:18.320 --> 18:21.959
You've been trading. I want my cut.

18:21.960 --> 18:26.319
Furnishing Golden Square has made such demands on my purse.

18:26.320 --> 18:28.359
I know you like dolls.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.480
Do you think I'm the village idiot?

18:35.840 --> 18:42.040
Pay me cash or I'll send someone round to break your legs.

18:48.280 --> 18:52.279
Do you seek bids, madam, for her time,

18:52.280 --> 18:55.919
dare I hope, her virginity?

18:55.920 --> 18:58.679
Gentlemen, this is an announcement

18:58.680 --> 19:02.959
that Kate is born this day and none of you are worthy of her.

19:06.280 --> 19:08.560
Name your price.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.159
Your credit is no good with me, sir.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.639
You stole my girl.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.079
Mm.

19:23.080 --> 19:25.439
Well, I'll pay for them both,

19:25.440 --> 19:27.599
double what you're imagining.

19:27.600 --> 19:30.622
You can't begin to guess what I'm imagining.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.669
You're not good enough for this angel.

19:35.760 --> 19:37.999
How you have fallen, Mrs.Quigley,

19:38.000 --> 19:39.959
hawking your stock like a costermonger.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.639
Oh, child, how delightful.

19:45.640 --> 19:50.000
Do not bother to seek me out, Anne, when he casts you aside.

20:00.680 --> 20:02.399
Did he not offer us a fortune?

20:02.400 --> 20:04.559
Nothing near it.

20:04.560 --> 20:08.279
But word about you will spread now like a thatch fire.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.999
Are you going to the event at St. James this evening?

20:11.593 --> 20:13.156
We know nothing of it.

20:13.157 --> 20:14.901
It is a rumored prizefight

20:14.902 --> 20:18.340
hosted by Lady Isabella Fitzwilliam, of all people.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.999
A glimpse of your charge would make my evening.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.502
We'll consider it.

20:24.520 --> 20:28.479
I do enjoy a little sport from time to time.

20:45.320 --> 20:46.674
Cocks.

20:47.840 --> 20:49.439
Looks like the truce still holds.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.119
Mm, don't delude yourself.

20:51.120 --> 20:53.439
They're stewing, licking their wounded pride.

20:53.440 --> 20:55.399
Keep your wits about you.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.839
We've hooked him.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.319
One more fishing trip, and we'll land him.

21:02.320 --> 21:03.679
I don't care anymore.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.559
Emily, we need you.

21:05.560 --> 21:07.359
He has a shrewish wife that you have to charm.

21:07.360 --> 21:08.679
Wives don't tend to like me.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.959
She will if you gossip with her.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.559
Oh, I don't want to gossip!

21:12.560 --> 21:14.639
You're the ace up our sleeve,

21:14.640 --> 21:18.319
the salt to the dish we serve.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.159
Keep talking.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.173
The star in my east.

21:33.017 --> 21:34.716
You like Mr.Croft, don't you?

21:35.520 --> 21:37.719
He sees things differently,

21:37.720 --> 21:40.200
sees a more equal world beyond rich and poor.

21:42.120 --> 21:45.599
He thinks we can change things. Imagine that.

21:46.600 --> 21:48.000
Be careful, my sweet.

22:00.400 --> 22:04.279
This was my world and everything to me.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.422
What's happened?

22:35.400 --> 22:37.759
Fanny!
Mrs.Wells!

22:37.760 --> 22:40.999
Is it really you?
Oh, my best girl.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.719
You're still here. What's happened?

22:43.720 --> 22:46.399
Oh, dear, don't worry. No one was hurt.

22:46.400 --> 22:48.519
Where's my children?
I'll find them.

22:48.520 --> 22:49.720
I'll find them for you.

22:51.560 --> 22:53.199
I'll be safe here.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.039
I'll get a coach back to you.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.720
And I won't be seen.

23:03.560 --> 23:06.402
Fanny, no one,

23:07.720 --> 23:08.879
no one must know I'm here.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.679
Of course not.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.079
Mr.North's in the kitchen.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.199
Careful.

23:38.480 --> 23:40.559
Margaret.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.839
We're all safe and well.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.880
Tell me about the fire. How did that start?

24:14.720 --> 24:17.759
Nancy said that she fell asleep downstairs,

24:17.760 --> 24:19.406
knocked over a candle.

24:21.200 --> 24:23.615
Doesn't sound like her.

24:24.660 --> 24:28.400
How in God's name did you manage to return so soon?

24:30.317 --> 24:31.717
I got married.

24:34.160 --> 24:35.719
You took another man's name?

24:35.720 --> 24:37.040
It was the only way.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.239
Mom!

24:48.240 --> 24:50.239
Jacob!

24:52.360 --> 24:54.719
My girls.

25:01.520 --> 25:04.079
Fuck me to America and back.

25:04.080 --> 25:07.239
Oh, Charlotte.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.919
Let me see you.

25:23.889 --> 25:26.969
Your business, sir?
Mrs.Lennox.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.360
She's not in.

25:39.920 --> 25:42.359
Who was that?

25:42.360 --> 25:43.455
Lord Leadsom.

25:43.782 --> 25:45.634
It's all right. I sent him away.
What?

25:45.635 --> 25:47.578
Well, you don't want to see him again, do you?

25:47.579 --> 25:49.860
He's my best payer. Please don't meddle with my business.

25:53.640 --> 25:55.799
I didn't think bawds took culls.

25:55.800 --> 25:58.359
They do if they pay five guineas a turn.

25:58.360 --> 26:01.359
That funds her children's schooling

26:01.360 --> 26:03.720
and pays most of the bills in the house.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.679
So how did you meet him?

26:09.680 --> 26:12.239
He bought me as an indentured servant,

26:12.240 --> 26:13.942
wanted me to cook his meals.

26:15.080 --> 26:17.463
You can't cook.

26:18.040 --> 26:19.615
Bet she didn't have to.

26:20.128 --> 26:22.368
I'm a harlot. I did what I had to.

26:23.680 --> 26:26.520
I feel sorry for him, played like a fiddle.

26:32.000 --> 26:34.200
Lydia Quigley in Bedlam.

26:35.680 --> 26:37.739
What has that done to her?
Forget her.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.559
That part of our life's over.

26:40.560 --> 26:43.760
And I own her house, so we won.

26:45.440 --> 26:46.920
My clever girls.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.200
My handsome boys.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.440
So you're back for good, Ma?

27:02.443 --> 27:04.642
I just wanna know what Ma's cooking for dinner.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.679
They're beautiful.

27:16.680 --> 27:19.239
To go with your new dress.

27:19.240 --> 27:20.879
You shouldn't be indulging me.

27:20.880 --> 27:22.944
They're a token of my gratitude.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.464
You woke me from a nightmare,

27:28.000 --> 27:29.879
brought me back to life.

27:35.160 --> 27:38.279
How are you gonna get rid of your husband?

27:38.280 --> 27:40.720
More important, how are we gonna keep the law off you?

27:44.124 --> 27:47.364
We could all be hanged for harboring you.

27:48.800 --> 27:51.359
I haven't thought beyond my own worry this whole year.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.139
Maybe London's not the place for us.

27:54.840 --> 27:58.279
You mean America? Not for Jacob and me,

27:58.280 --> 28:00.919
unless you want us as house boys for you and your husband.

28:01.601 --> 28:04.220
No! No.

28:05.235 --> 28:08.075
Like I said, I haven't thought.

28:11.600 --> 28:12.879
I have to go.

28:14.320 --> 28:15.999
I shall return tomorrow.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.439
You can tell me all about your boxing.

28:18.440 --> 28:20.439
You're going back to Mr.Young?

28:20.440 --> 28:22.359
I have to.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.679
He'll be worried.

28:23.680 --> 28:25.800
And we have been all year.

28:29.480 --> 28:31.080
I'll make it right.

28:40.600 --> 28:43.359
I've missed her. I have.

28:43.360 --> 28:45.599
But this past year, I've been able to breathe.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.839
I know.
She takes over.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.599
She wants us to go to America.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.479
She's always done what she thinks is best for us.

28:51.480 --> 28:53.199
Yet chose this life.

28:53.200 --> 28:55.560
Fate chose it and for her too.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.719
You think I'm a terrible person.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.279
I can see it.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.799
You can't beat me. I'm fucking Isaac Pincher.

29:02.800 --> 29:05.239
What?

29:05.240 --> 29:08.279
Makes no sense, but I can't keep my hands off him.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.919
It's good when it's like that.

29:11.200 --> 29:14.120
What's America like, Mr.Young?

29:15.440 --> 29:18.639
Is it very big?

29:18.640 --> 29:20.599
The size cannot be grasped.

29:20.600 --> 29:24.080
Try me. I'm good at grasping size.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.639
You remind me of my wife.

29:33.280 --> 29:35.999
Ah, our friends are back

29:36.000 --> 29:38.640
with delightful reinforcements.

29:41.960 --> 29:43.519
I'm Mrs.Margaret Young.

29:45.531 --> 29:46.651
And you are?

29:48.520 --> 29:53.439
Mrs.Young, I have a...a...a gift for you, for a lady:

29:53.440 --> 29:58.480
the finest muff pistol modeled by my own hand.

30:02.520 --> 30:04.559
It is a beauty, Mr.Chadwick.

30:04.560 --> 30:06.199
I shall treasure it in my muff.

30:06.200 --> 30:07.599
What's the matter with you?

30:07.600 --> 30:12.720
And this I propose as our deposit.

30:14.477 --> 30:16.237
Gold for ground.

30:20.256 --> 30:22.816
I think they're serious, don't you, my dear?

30:25.160 --> 30:27.879
Perhaps the, uh, young lady might like some air?

30:27.880 --> 30:28.960
Hmm.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.679
You're meant to be dead!

30:36.680 --> 30:39.399
Shh. You never saw me.

30:39.400 --> 30:42.159
How are you here? You were hanged!

30:42.160 --> 30:43.759
I've got a slippery neck.

30:43.760 --> 30:46.119
Is this genuine, or are you two duping us?

30:46.120 --> 30:47.199
No, it's real,

30:47.200 --> 30:49.639
and you're shrewd to chase it.

30:49.640 --> 30:50.885
Breathe a word

30:50.886 --> 30:54.239
and I'll make sure that your boys lose their chance at this land.

30:54.240 --> 30:58.199
Now, you go about your business and I'll go about mine

30:58.200 --> 31:00.319
and we'll both be happy.

31:00.320 --> 31:02.360
So long as we make the purchase.

31:04.920 --> 31:06.519
Still a conniving cat.

31:08.200 --> 31:11.119
Can't touch you, Mrs.Wells.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.719
More tricks up your sleeve than a conjurer.

31:18.840 --> 31:21.439
She always said she'd rather eat maggots than marry.

31:21.440 --> 31:22.639
I wish she had.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.719
She never makes it easy.

31:24.720 --> 31:27.159
That's Mags. Pain in the ass.

31:27.160 --> 31:30.240
I've dreamt of this moment, longed for it.

31:31.800 --> 31:34.240
Yet now I feel like she's put me head through a mangle.

31:36.760 --> 31:38.320
Just be grateful, Will.

31:45.080 --> 31:46.639
You look beautiful.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.039
You look lovely too.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.439
The new Kate Bottomley.

31:57.960 --> 32:00.559
No, not Bottomley.

32:03.520 --> 32:07.279
If I'm dead to my family, then they're dead to me.

32:07.280 --> 32:08.959
I want to be called Quigley.

32:15.400 --> 32:20.279
You made a good proposal and we're keen to be homeward bound,

32:20.280 --> 32:22.759
so I'll happily sell to you.

32:28.440 --> 32:30.559
Well, we should celebrate.

32:30.560 --> 32:33.959
There is the most extraordinary night in the offing in St. James,

32:33.960 --> 32:37.159
pugilism hosted by a scandalous lady

32:37.160 --> 32:40.560
and a renowned courtesan, Miss Charlotte Wells.

32:43.040 --> 32:46.999
I love a boxing match. Uh, would you mind, Margaret?

32:47.000 --> 32:49.039
You're not too tired from the journey?

32:49.040 --> 32:50.571
Too tired to sleep.

32:50.572 --> 32:54.155
I'll have the deeds drawn up, and we can all sign them tonight.

32:54.156 --> 32:55.316
Ah.

33:16.840 --> 33:19.039
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

33:19.040 --> 33:22.359
Be sure to take a look at tonight's contenders,

33:22.360 --> 33:24.719
two potent pugilists.

33:24.720 --> 33:29.879
Undefeated in 28 bouts, champion John "Killer" Kelly,

33:29.880 --> 33:32.759
and challenger Jack "The Lad" Lively.

33:35.040 --> 33:36.799
Mr.North.

33:36.800 --> 33:39.239
You're the main attraction, as far as I can see.

33:39.240 --> 33:42.039
You like boxing, Mrs.Harvey?
I like boxers.

33:44.360 --> 33:46.679
Uh, I can see you don't need me.

33:50.360 --> 33:54.479
I didn't realize it would be such a crowded affair.

33:54.480 --> 33:56.079
I'd rather be alone with you.

34:08.000 --> 34:09.799
There's my Mr.Croft.

34:13.040 --> 34:15.119
This isn't the tailor's, Fredo.

34:17.239 --> 34:18.918
Ready to greet your guests?

34:21.760 --> 34:23.119
I am now.

34:23.120 --> 34:25.120
**

34:45.480 --> 34:49.839
Bravo! Bravo!

34:49.840 --> 34:53.679
Bravo! Bravo!

34:56.159 --> 34:58.919
Yes, bravo.

34:58.920 --> 35:03.599
And thank you, Lady Isabella, for this magnificent venue.

35:03.600 --> 35:08.039
Who will be her champion, the Lad Lively or Killer Kelly?

35:08.040 --> 35:09.959
Place your bets!

35:12.600 --> 35:14.079
What are you doing here?

35:14.080 --> 35:18.140
I wanted to present to you my daughter.

35:19.811 --> 35:22.199
Kate Quigley, pleased to meet you.

35:24.400 --> 35:30.119
We've been rather starved of society of late. Hmm.

35:31.720 --> 35:33.439
Then enjoy your evening.

35:35.240 --> 35:36.799
I was going to throw her out.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.479
Mm, ignore her.

35:38.480 --> 35:39.959
I think she finally has cracked

35:39.960 --> 35:41.959
and found a poor mad girl to boot.

35:59.680 --> 36:01.559
Mrs.Young, I presume.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.839
Nance!

36:02.840 --> 36:07.199
Oh, oh!

36:13.040 --> 36:14.159
He's bigger than I thought.

36:14.160 --> 36:16.799
Big means slow.
Yeah.

36:16.800 --> 36:19.959
Wish I was fighting Loathsome.

36:19.960 --> 36:22.239
I happen to know he's bet very heavily against you.

36:22.240 --> 36:24.259
Is that so?
Mm.

36:25.360 --> 36:27.599
The dog is going to die!

36:29.280 --> 36:31.039
Do we have 20 on Lively?

36:37.800 --> 36:40.119
Do you have a tip for me, Mr.Croft?

36:43.000 --> 36:45.559
Mr.Croft, you've been hiding from me.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.239
Come and pour me some punch.

36:54.000 --> 36:55.839
What are you doing?
Saving him

36:55.840 --> 36:58.359
and all of us from your puppy dog eyes.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.319
You keep close to Chadwick.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.599
You keep Mr.Young away from the Wells.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.479
This is a stupid fucking idea.

37:07.480 --> 37:09.320
What, don't you want to see your sweetheart?

37:16.200 --> 37:18.359
Any regrets?

37:18.360 --> 37:22.199
It's noise, color, laughter, life.

37:22.200 --> 37:24.079
How can I regret any of that?

37:24.080 --> 37:25.839
Hmm.

37:30.160 --> 37:33.219
It's also unwanted guests. I'll deal with these.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.079
You're either an imp or an imbecile for showing up here.

37:37.080 --> 37:40.239
Don't you want to add some spice to your evening?

37:40.240 --> 37:42.599
The boxers are practically family.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.499
So if you don't want your pretty little face messed up,

37:44.500 --> 37:45.719
you'll behave like a lamb.

38:13.440 --> 38:15.039
What the hell are they doing here?

38:15.040 --> 38:17.159
Keep your enemies close. Isn't that what they say?

38:26.800 --> 38:32.079
Gentlemen, why bother with this crude barbarism

38:32.080 --> 38:36.239
when Venus is amongst you?

38:36.240 --> 38:40.339
The goddess seeks to bestow her blessings.

38:41.240 --> 38:44.239
Venus, your servant.

38:44.240 --> 38:45.639
This is not a flesh market.

38:45.640 --> 38:47.094
Really?

38:48.080 --> 38:49.599
Please leave now.

38:49.600 --> 38:52.106
But I'm yet to thank you.

38:53.480 --> 38:57.839
The kindness you showed me gave me the strength to escape Bedlam.

38:57.840 --> 38:59.559
Leave my house.

38:59.560 --> 39:00.894
As you wish.

39:01.920 --> 39:03.399
But hear this:

39:03.400 --> 39:06.999
the doctor I was assigned to is disgraced.

39:07.000 --> 39:11.839
I will not be going back to Bedlam before you.

39:11.840 --> 39:13.759
Fuck off, Lydia.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.486
No.

39:18.755 --> 39:20.315
You fuck off.

39:22.903 --> 39:26.510
All this time, it's been my only waking thought:

39:27.280 --> 39:29.799
try and get back to England.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.679
Find my family.

39:31.680 --> 39:33.320
Make sure everyone's safe.

39:34.680 --> 39:38.080
Now here I am and you're doing better without me.

39:39.828 --> 39:41.068
Not everyone.

39:43.920 --> 39:45.179
I can't stay,

39:45.880 --> 39:47.600
not with a death sentence on me.

39:49.600 --> 39:53.200
But I can't leave, not without them.

39:55.360 --> 39:58.479
And Will, Jonas...

39:58.480 --> 40:00.680
It's like you got a foot in each life.

40:03.640 --> 40:06.239
That has got to split your fanny some.

40:12.120 --> 40:14.200
Never were good with a plan, were you?

40:18.720 --> 40:20.440
Jonas was indentured too.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.720
He understands me.

40:28.600 --> 40:30.000
What's he like in the hay?

40:31.360 --> 40:34.119
Surprising.
Oh!

40:34.120 --> 40:37.199
Well, you are in trouble, girl.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.206
I know.

40:43.800 --> 40:45.360
Tell me about the fire.

40:47.040 --> 40:48.839
How did it start, really?

40:50.019 --> 40:52.039
Piece of coal fell out the hearth.

40:56.560 --> 40:58.160
I thought it was a candle.

40:59.920 --> 41:02.200
Coal knocked over a candle.

41:16.960 --> 41:19.079
They might as well have a tumble in the boxing ring.

41:22.360 --> 41:24.879
Low-down, conniving wind fuckers.

41:24.880 --> 41:27.039
Trust Emily Lacey to get in with scum.

41:27.040 --> 41:30.079
We've had our retribution. Don't involve yourself.

41:30.080 --> 41:31.839
Those Pincher boys made me like them.

41:31.840 --> 41:33.799
I've got to warn Jonas not to sell to them.

41:33.800 --> 41:36.399
Half of Soho's at that party. You'll be recognized.

41:36.400 --> 41:39.623
Then think of something because I'm going.

41:40.960 --> 41:42.053
You ready?

41:43.160 --> 41:45.039
Have a good fight, boys.

41:50.120 --> 41:52.039
For luck.

41:55.840 --> 41:58.920
Lady Isabella, will you do the honors?

42:19.600 --> 42:22.079
Mrs.Quigley, do you feel unwell?

42:23.440 --> 42:25.679
Rest here. I'll fetch you a drink.

42:30.480 --> 42:33.959
How about a game of backgammon?

42:33.960 --> 42:35.559
Don't crowd a lady.

42:36.560 --> 42:38.599
Take your high spirits to the boxing.

42:38.600 --> 42:41.439
Sorry, Miss Wells. I was only playing.

42:43.840 --> 42:45.599
Muckworm.

42:45.600 --> 42:47.519
How do you do that,

42:47.520 --> 42:49.549
get men to do as you say?

42:50.680 --> 42:53.039
I'm sure your mother will teach you.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.696
Well, she's not really my mother.

42:55.320 --> 42:56.604
She's dangerous.

42:57.400 --> 42:58.670
Be careful.

42:59.200 --> 43:00.759
Find me if you get more trouble.

43:10.760 --> 43:13.039
So he's the man to beat?

43:13.040 --> 43:14.399
Come on!

43:14.400 --> 43:16.039
My boy's the challenger.

43:16.040 --> 43:18.799
Lost his last fight, wants to prove himself.

43:18.800 --> 43:20.159
Worth the risk?

43:20.160 --> 43:21.479
I think so.

43:23.680 --> 43:25.479
Jonas Young.

43:27.840 --> 43:29.679
William North.

43:37.160 --> 43:38.560
Why are they so friendly?

43:50.240 --> 43:51.359
Come on, Jack.

44:00.200 --> 44:01.999
Nancy.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.639
Will is with Jonas.

44:06.200 --> 44:07.520
Keep your head down.

44:08.880 --> 44:10.639
Charlotte.

44:10.640 --> 44:12.719
Ma, you can't be here.

44:12.720 --> 44:15.599
I need you to fetch Jonas away from your pa.

44:16.800 --> 44:18.236
Please.

44:19.080 --> 44:20.563
That's him,

44:21.160 --> 44:22.980
your Irish husband who's gonna sweep you back

44:22.981 --> 44:24.624
to the good life in America?

44:27.640 --> 44:29.799
He doesn't know about Will.

44:29.800 --> 44:34.200
It's funny. I nearly went to America with an Irishman.

44:35.680 --> 44:37.439
It's as if you're living my life

44:37.440 --> 44:39.680
and I'm in Greek Street living yours.

44:47.320 --> 44:49.319
Mr.Young.

44:49.320 --> 44:50.840
Excuse me.

44:51.680 --> 44:53.679
I'm Charlotte.
Charlotte?

44:55.084 --> 44:56.408
You're more beautiful

44:56.409 --> 44:58.279
than even your mother could begin to describe.

44:58.280 --> 44:59.719
She's gonna ruin the deal.

44:59.720 --> 45:02.039
But how would she even know about it?

45:02.816 --> 45:04.919
Why take such a risk?

45:04.920 --> 45:06.448
I had to come.

45:08.099 --> 45:10.170
I need to warn you about the Pinchers.

45:11.280 --> 45:13.479
Hal. Look at me.

45:13.480 --> 45:16.319
If you make trouble for Charlotte Wells, we won't succeed.

45:16.320 --> 45:19.439
Understand? Why are you so certain?

45:19.440 --> 45:22.199
I can't say. Trust me.

45:22.200 --> 45:24.359
I want this as much as you.

45:24.360 --> 45:26.559
Charlotte knows about the deal from you.

45:26.560 --> 45:28.719
You add two and two and reach ten again.

45:28.720 --> 45:30.439
Then get her out of the picture.

45:37.120 --> 45:38.799
Kill him!

45:38.800 --> 45:41.359
What game are you playing with Mr.Young?

45:41.360 --> 45:43.359
I've just met him.

45:43.360 --> 45:45.559
You intend on stealing from us again,

45:45.560 --> 45:46.839
sabotaging our deal?

45:46.840 --> 45:49.159
What deal?

45:49.160 --> 45:50.639
He's a guest.

45:50.640 --> 45:52.439
I'm being nice to him as I'm nice to you.

45:52.440 --> 45:55.679
You're a horror with me, tantalizing witch.

45:55.680 --> 45:58.393
Oh, that's all in your mind. I'm very forthcoming.

45:59.520 --> 46:00.913
I hope you will be soon.

46:04.120 --> 46:05.999
Not here. I can't.

46:22.520 --> 46:24.759
Just one kiss.

46:31.560 --> 46:33.719
You know one's not enough.

46:46.200 --> 46:47.646
I'm sorry, son,

46:48.080 --> 46:50.959
but I don't do business with arsonists.

46:50.960 --> 46:54.759
Take a look at yourself before venturing into the marketplace again.

47:00.040 --> 47:01.359
Let's go home.

47:01.360 --> 47:03.079
Nothing can be made right tonight.

47:03.080 --> 47:04.928
Hal, let's leave!

47:06.000 --> 47:07.639
Hey, talk to me!

47:07.640 --> 47:10.439
Now, what's all this I've been hearing about arson?

47:10.440 --> 47:11.639
Huh?

47:11.640 --> 47:14.799
Jack, Jack, Jack! Yeah!

47:14.800 --> 47:16.199
Come on, Jack!

47:29.040 --> 47:31.199
Nothing between you?
Get off him!

47:31.200 --> 47:32.959
You've ruined everything for a fucking whore!

47:37.640 --> 47:39.039
No, you're killing him! Stop!
