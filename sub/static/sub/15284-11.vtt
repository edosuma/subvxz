00:58.136 --> 00:59.636
Where did you come from?

00:59.704 --> 01:00.737
It's been a long time, Patty.

01:00.805 --> 01:02.739
I bet you didn't think
I'd track you down.

01:02.807 --> 01:05.609
My name isn't P--
what are you talking about?

01:06.711 --> 01:08.144
No. No. Wait.

01:08.212 --> 01:09.479
What are you doing?

01:09.547 --> 01:11.381
Lay down on your stomach.

01:11.448 --> 01:12.649
Please. I'm only--

01:12.717 --> 01:13.583
Your stomach.

01:13.651 --> 01:14.583
Don't do this.

01:14.651 --> 01:16.084
I'm just a humble servant.

01:16.152 --> 01:18.721
Shh...

01:18.788 --> 01:22.224
What is it you call
yourself now? Floressa?

01:22.291 --> 01:24.026
No, you're making
a mistake.

01:24.093 --> 01:27.396
Yes, okay, I changed my name
to Floressa when I came here.

01:27.463 --> 01:28.831
But before then
I wasn't Patty.

01:28.899 --> 01:31.666
I was Nina.
I was Nina Skinner from Joplin--

01:31.734 --> 01:33.801
Bite that. Bite down.

01:33.869 --> 01:35.336
There.

01:44.312 --> 01:47.848
I always wondered what
Spencer Reid's grocery list looked like.

01:47.916 --> 01:50.784
It's actually
Rieman's hypothesis.

01:50.852 --> 01:52.352
Which is?

01:52.420 --> 01:54.021
It's a mathematical
conjecture from the 19th century

01:54.088 --> 01:55.989
that states that the Riemann zeta
function zeroes

01:56.057 --> 01:57.524
all lie on
the critical line.

01:57.592 --> 01:58.625
Yeah, I get it.

01:58.693 --> 02:00.393
I noodle it
from time to time.

02:00.461 --> 02:01.929
It sort of helps me
unwind, you know?

02:01.996 --> 02:03.930
Well, since were on
the subject of unwinding,

02:03.997 --> 02:05.798
how'd your date go?

02:05.866 --> 02:09.202
Uh, had to cancel
at the last minute.

02:09.270 --> 02:11.538
Oh? You did or she did?

02:11.605 --> 02:13.706
Um, sort of both did.

02:13.774 --> 02:15.808
But...it's fine.
I talked to her this morning

02:15.876 --> 02:18.244
and things are good.

02:18.312 --> 02:20.946
Round table's about to start.
We should probably get going.

02:24.717 --> 02:25.784
Rossi: What have we got?

02:25.851 --> 02:28.153
Nothing good. Okay, anyone
who's wandered through

02:28.221 --> 02:30.322
a museum in Italy knows that
a chisel and a hammer

02:30.390 --> 02:31.990
in the right hands
can be a beautiful thing.

02:32.058 --> 02:33.592
But Michelangelo
this is not, my friends.

02:33.659 --> 02:36.660
Okay, Floressa,
aka Nina Skinner,

02:36.728 --> 02:39.697
was found yesterday,
murdered on the grounds

02:39.764 --> 02:41.466
of Church of the First
Dawn, in Alabama.

02:41.533 --> 02:43.701
Two days earlier,
100 miles away,

02:43.768 --> 02:46.704
Charlie Clayton was taken
from his home in Gulfport, Mississippi,

02:46.771 --> 02:48.839
he was brought to the woods,
he was also murdered.

02:48.907 --> 02:50.541
Chisels to the brain.

02:50.609 --> 02:52.142
And a lot of creepy-crawlers.

02:52.210 --> 02:53.843
Forensics?

02:53.911 --> 02:56.179
Mm-mmm. Neither crime scene
yielded much results

02:56.247 --> 02:57.714
because of too many bugs
and critters.

02:57.781 --> 03:00.383
The choice and placement
of the chisel is very specific.

03:00.451 --> 03:02.552
Maybe the unsub
symbolically is destroying

03:02.620 --> 03:04.321
the thoughts and memories
of the victims.

03:04.388 --> 03:05.788
It looks like
they were facedown

03:05.856 --> 03:07.491
when the chisel went in.
Remorse?

03:07.558 --> 03:09.525
Could be the killer
knew the victims,

03:09.593 --> 03:11.828
didn't want to see their faces
when he was killing them.

03:11.895 --> 03:14.063
Was their a connection
between Clayton and Floressa?

03:14.131 --> 03:15.632
Nothing's been found yet.

03:15.699 --> 03:17.634
So right now, method of execution
and regional proximity

03:17.701 --> 03:19.568
are the only two things
linking them.

03:19.637 --> 03:22.271
It could be a spree
killer on the move.

03:22.339 --> 03:24.702
A spree killer who's
careful and meticulous

03:24.727 --> 03:25.974
and covers his tracks.

03:25.975 --> 03:28.276
We've got a mobile unsub
with a significant head start.

03:28.344 --> 03:30.145
We can't afford
to be playing catch-up.

03:30.212 --> 03:32.580
Wheels up in 30.

Reid: "I have never yet

who was not afraid
of a ghost."

04:49.051 --> 04:51.019
John Philpot Curran.

04:52.889 --> 04:55.223
These first two victims
couldn't be more different.

04:55.290 --> 04:58.793
Ethnicity, gender, age,
social and economic background.

04:58.861 --> 05:02.397
Both were born and raised in
the deep south. But that's it.

05:02.464 --> 05:05.198
Garcia, you said that the last victim,
Floressa, changed her name?

05:05.266 --> 05:07.668
Yeah. Her name was Nina Skinner
and she changed it

05:07.736 --> 05:10.004
when she joined
Church of the First Dawn 6 years ago.

05:10.071 --> 05:12.573
What do we know
about this church?

05:12.641 --> 05:13.941
Is it a legitimate
religion?

05:14.009 --> 05:16.710
Ah, it's more like
religious adjacent.

05:16.778 --> 05:18.345
It appears to be
a hodgepodge

05:18.413 --> 05:20.413
of a bunch of different religious beliefs
plucked from here and there.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.215
And Floressa lived
on the grounds of the church?

05:23.283 --> 05:25.117
Yes. She and 15 other women.

05:25.185 --> 05:26.586
It sounds like a convent.

05:26.654 --> 05:28.621
You know, it sort of is.

05:28.689 --> 05:31.223
The residents had to take
the same kinds of vows

05:31.291 --> 05:32.792
as nuns--celibacy, poverty,

05:32.860 --> 05:34.693
days spent in quiet
contemplation.

05:34.761 --> 05:36.695
I would not be
a good candidate

05:36.763 --> 05:38.229
for admission,
in other words.

05:38.297 --> 05:40.532
Garcia, did the compound
allow outsiders?

05:40.600 --> 05:43.268
Not usually, but it appears
that once or twice a year

05:43.335 --> 05:45.604
they do let in non-members
for like a week-long retreat.

05:45.672 --> 05:47.439
Are these non-members
men and women?

05:47.506 --> 05:48.440
Apparently so.

05:48.507 --> 05:49.708
Garcia, compile
a list of guests

05:49.776 --> 05:51.709
for these retreats
for the last year, please.

05:51.777 --> 05:53.243
Will do.

05:53.311 --> 05:54.879
It says here that the first
victim, Charlie Clayton,

05:54.947 --> 05:56.246
was a Seventh Day Adventist.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.082
Could this be someone
harboring a grudge against religion?

05:58.149 --> 05:59.584
Or the opposite.

05:59.651 --> 06:02.987
Both victims gravitated
toward non-mainstream faiths.

06:03.055 --> 06:04.589
This could be a zealot
wanting to punish those

06:04.656 --> 06:07.924
who deviate from
strict orthodox beliefs.

06:07.992 --> 06:09.893
Blake, you and Reid
go see the medical examiner.

06:09.961 --> 06:11.828
Morgan and Rossi,
drive to Mississippi

06:11.896 --> 06:14.097
and see what you can find out
about the first victim.

06:14.164 --> 06:17.734
JJ and I will go to the compound
and see where Floressa was killed.

06:17.802 --> 06:19.502
How long have you
been head of the church?

06:19.570 --> 06:21.004
35 years.

06:21.072 --> 06:22.472
I founded it.

06:22.539 --> 06:24.807
And Floressa joined
6 years ago?

06:24.874 --> 06:26.174
Yes.

06:26.242 --> 06:29.011
How much contact would she
have had with the outside world?

06:29.079 --> 06:31.480
None. The women who are
custodians of the faith

06:31.547 --> 06:34.516
turn themselves over
to it completely.

06:34.584 --> 06:38.087
And the people you allow
for the week-long retreats,

06:38.154 --> 06:40.354
would Floressa have
interacted with them?

06:40.422 --> 06:43.491
No. Guests are housed
in a separate area.

06:43.558 --> 06:46.828
We provide them a quiet
space for contemplation.

06:46.895 --> 06:49.130
Did this man ever go
to any of your retreats?

06:49.197 --> 06:52.867
No. I've never
seen him before.

07:00.207 --> 07:02.575
This is where
it happened.

07:02.644 --> 07:05.812
I still can't
believe it.

07:05.880 --> 07:08.148
Is there any sort
of screening process

07:08.215 --> 07:09.816
before you accept a resident

07:09.884 --> 07:11.984
studying the faith
like Floressa?

07:12.052 --> 07:13.552
I don't understand.

07:13.620 --> 07:14.787
Like a background check?

07:14.855 --> 07:17.623
The killer may have known
her before she came here.

07:17.691 --> 07:19.558
And if she'd
had a troubled past,

07:19.626 --> 07:21.727
she might have seen this
as a refuge.

07:21.795 --> 07:26.198
Floressa was a woman
of deep and sincere faith.

07:26.266 --> 07:29.167
There was no need for us

07:29.234 --> 07:33.004
to investigate
her previous life.

07:33.072 --> 07:37.175
If a holy sanctuary
isn't immune from

07:37.242 --> 07:40.712
a horrible act
like this, what is?

07:53.257 --> 07:55.959
Uh, let me guess.

07:56.027 --> 07:59.361
She don't know nothin'
about nothin'.

07:59.429 --> 08:01.064
Practically a direct quote.

08:01.131 --> 08:02.799
How did you know that?

08:02.866 --> 08:04.701
Oh, it's a busy enough
street.

08:04.768 --> 08:05.968
Broad daylight.

08:06.036 --> 08:07.136
House is fully exposed.

08:07.204 --> 08:09.138
Either this unsub
is really, really good,

08:09.206 --> 08:12.308
or this is the worst
neighborhood watch program.

08:21.483 --> 08:24.652
I already told the regular
police I didn't see anything.

08:24.721 --> 08:27.723
Well, that's a shame.

08:27.790 --> 08:29.891
Oh, by the way,

08:29.959 --> 08:31.025
we couldn't help
but notice

08:31.093 --> 08:33.894
all of these, uh,
empty jars.

08:33.962 --> 08:37.798
I find 'em in the garbage cans
and turn 'em in for money.

08:37.866 --> 08:39.767
Sanitized?

08:39.835 --> 08:41.802
Huh?

08:41.870 --> 08:43.303
My third wife,
she always said

08:43.371 --> 08:45.139
I was part bloodhound.

08:45.207 --> 08:48.875
All of those jars, they smell of...
Disinfectant.

08:48.943 --> 08:51.878
I can vouch for
the bloodhound part.

08:51.946 --> 08:53.780
He sniffed out
your mailbox.

08:53.848 --> 08:56.249
Converted whiskey jars
hold their scent.

08:56.316 --> 08:58.918
As do converted
moonshine jugs.

08:58.986 --> 09:00.586
Only thing is,
making moonshine

09:00.654 --> 09:02.955
is against the law, so maybe
my friend's nose here

09:03.022 --> 09:04.322
is wrong this time.

09:05.524 --> 09:07.860
Well, a weird guy came over
when I was out front

09:07.927 --> 09:10.662
and started talking to me,
that's all.

09:10.730 --> 09:12.264
Asked about Charlie.

09:12.331 --> 09:13.465
Asking what?

09:13.532 --> 09:16.635
Just wanted to make sure
that is where he lived.

09:16.702 --> 09:18.836
Kept calling him Taylor,
though.

09:18.904 --> 09:20.238
Taylor?

09:20.305 --> 09:22.306
So maybe Charlie wasn't
who he was looking for.

09:22.374 --> 09:25.442
Oh, it was. This guy
described Charlie to a "T".

09:25.510 --> 09:27.912
The guy you talked to,
you remember what he looked like?

09:27.980 --> 09:32.516
Sure. Heh. You might have
the nose, but I got the eyes.

09:32.584 --> 09:35.252
In my line of work,
you'd best not forget a face.

09:35.319 --> 09:37.620
Put on another shirt.

09:37.688 --> 09:40.323
We're going for a ride.

09:40.391 --> 09:42.793
Chisel severed
the brain stem.

09:42.860 --> 09:44.995
Clean, quick,
right on the money.

09:45.062 --> 09:46.797
Death was instantaneous.

09:46.864 --> 09:48.331
Were there any drugs
in her system?

09:48.399 --> 09:51.000
Nope. Tox screen was clean.

09:51.067 --> 09:52.168
Hmm.

09:52.235 --> 09:54.603
Yet she seemed
totally compliant.

09:54.671 --> 09:57.273
To control her, the unsub
must have been armed.

09:57.340 --> 09:59.474
Any evidence of torture
or sexual abuse?

09:59.542 --> 10:00.475
None.

10:00.543 --> 10:02.311
Except for the chisel
in her head,

10:02.378 --> 10:05.181
the victim was
in tip-top shape.

10:05.248 --> 10:06.315
Did find some wood
residue in the teeth,

10:06.382 --> 10:08.317
back molars,
both sides of the mouth.

10:08.384 --> 10:10.885
Killer might have somehow
used the stick as a gag?

10:10.953 --> 10:15.256
It says here there was
excessive insect infestation?

10:15.325 --> 10:17.025
Sure was.

10:17.092 --> 10:19.728
And the wrong kind
and in the wrong place.

10:19.796 --> 10:21.797
Blake: What do you mean?

10:21.864 --> 10:24.465
The victim was only dead
a few hours.

10:24.533 --> 10:27.234
There should have been adult flies
and unhatched eggs, maybe.

10:27.302 --> 10:30.037
Certainly not third-instar
larvae.

10:30.104 --> 10:32.139
And the maggots
were all over the place.

10:32.207 --> 10:34.141
Flies don't lay their eggs
around the food source,

10:34.209 --> 10:36.577
they squirt 'em out right there
in the blood and guts.

10:36.645 --> 10:38.212
And icing on the cake--

10:38.279 --> 10:41.648
I found a composite of animal hair
mixed in with the larvae--

10:41.716 --> 10:43.817
turns out to be skunk.

10:43.884 --> 10:45.433
Were these inconsistencies
present in the first victim,

10:45.458 --> 10:47.053
the one from Mississippi?

10:47.054 --> 10:49.055
Don't know about
the animal hair, but yeah.

10:49.122 --> 10:52.191
Gulfport M.E. found the exact
same thing at his crime scene--

10:52.259 --> 10:55.261
the mass insect infestation
not consistent with

10:55.329 --> 10:56.762
the early stage
of decomposition.

10:56.830 --> 11:02.133
This unsub is bringing fly larvae
to the crime scene with him.

11:14.313 --> 11:17.782
Our unsub is skilled
at avoiding detection.

11:17.850 --> 11:20.185
A man in this environment
would have stood out.

11:20.253 --> 11:22.124
Have Garcia check for male
maintenance workers,

11:22.149 --> 11:23.088
any city employees

11:23.089 --> 11:24.956
that might have access
to this part of the compound.

11:25.024 --> 11:26.858
[Cell phone rings]

11:26.926 --> 11:28.392
What have you got,
Morgan?

11:28.459 --> 11:30.394
Hey, we found a neighbor
who not only saw the unsub,

11:30.461 --> 11:31.561
but he spoke with him, too.

11:31.629 --> 11:33.197
The day of the murder?

11:33.265 --> 11:35.465
Yeah. Unsub was trying to make
sure of Charlie Clayton's address,

11:35.533 --> 11:37.034
but kept referring
to the victim as Taylor.

11:37.102 --> 11:38.969
Neighbor give enough
of a description to get a sketch?

11:39.037 --> 11:40.504
Yeah, I got it right here
in my hands.

11:40.571 --> 11:42.273
It's a damn good one, too.

11:42.340 --> 11:44.607
I'll text it right over.

11:48.112 --> 11:51.847
[Indistinct chatter]

11:53.517 --> 11:55.818
Top that off for you?

12:07.230 --> 12:08.663
Need a menu?

12:08.731 --> 12:12.200
No. But thanks
for asking, Carol.

12:12.268 --> 12:14.102
You've got the wrong gal.

12:14.170 --> 12:15.404
I'm Brianna.

12:15.471 --> 12:17.838
I don't think so.

12:17.906 --> 12:20.574
Recognize me yet?

12:20.642 --> 12:24.045
I made it easy for you.

12:28.716 --> 12:30.717
So just coffee, then?

12:30.785 --> 12:33.486
The sign up there says I get
a free dessert if it's my birthday.

12:33.554 --> 12:37.290
Uh-huh. And today happens
to be your birthday?

12:37.358 --> 12:38.458
Yes, ma'am.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.827
Well, I'm gonna need
some I.D. to verify that.

12:43.831 --> 12:44.764
[Chuckles]

12:44.832 --> 12:47.667
I have no reason
to lie to you, Carol.

12:47.734 --> 12:50.936
Especially about the day
a person was born.

12:51.004 --> 12:55.007
It's the most important
day there is.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.378
You of all people
should realize that.

13:25.203 --> 13:27.336
Molly's not gonna like
that you did that.

13:27.404 --> 13:30.239
It shut the guy up, didn't it?

13:30.307 --> 13:32.241
Seriously, how come
all the weirdoes

13:32.309 --> 13:33.942
always sit in my section
instead of yours?

13:34.011 --> 13:36.912
Oh, I don't know. Maybe
you have that special something.

13:36.980 --> 13:38.580
Yeah, right?

13:38.648 --> 13:42.251
Next job I get is gonna be
at a fire lookout station

13:42.319 --> 13:44.185
way up in the mountains.

13:44.253 --> 13:46.922
No dealing with
the public at all.

13:46.990 --> 13:50.358
[Laughs]

13:51.193 --> 13:53.261
JJ: A dead skunk?

13:53.329 --> 13:54.262
No. Why?

13:54.330 --> 13:56.272
Skunk hair was found in the larvae
at Floressa's crime scene.

13:56.273 --> 13:58.440
Thought maybe there was one
laying around nearby.

13:58.535 --> 14:00.434
I would have sniffed it out
had there been one.

14:00.502 --> 14:01.536
Here's the police sketch.

14:01.603 --> 14:03.871
This guy's brazen.

14:03.939 --> 14:05.406
Chatting with the neighbor
about the person

14:05.473 --> 14:06.541
he's on his way to murder.

14:06.608 --> 14:07.975
He's too calm
to be on a spree.

14:08.043 --> 14:09.410
Something else
is motivating him.

14:09.477 --> 14:10.545
Okay, great. Thanks.

14:10.612 --> 14:12.780
Two for two.
Gulfport M.E.

14:12.848 --> 14:15.449
also found animal hair
on the first victim's larvae--

14:15.517 --> 14:17.337
raccoon--and Charlie Clayton
had wood residue in his teeth

14:17.362 --> 14:18.815
just like Floressa.

14:18.920 --> 14:20.687
- Russell Smith.
JJ: Who?

14:20.755 --> 14:22.656
A serial killer who was active
in this part of the country

14:22.723 --> 14:24.323
from 1967 to 1987.

14:24.391 --> 14:26.560
I remember.
Smith was a sexual sadist

14:26.627 --> 14:29.696
who murdered 8 prostitutes before
being killed in a police shootout.

14:29.764 --> 14:31.827
And he had his victims
bite down on a block of wood

14:31.852 --> 14:33.852
before he killed them.

14:38.638 --> 14:41.440
- Good night, Chris.
- Good night, Brianna.

14:57.522 --> 14:58.990
Oh, my God.

15:00.125 --> 15:02.293
[Muffled scream]

15:02.360 --> 15:04.995
Bite down--hard.

15:05.063 --> 15:06.697
Uhh!

15:21.029 --> 15:22.729
A chisel
right in the skull.

15:23.028 --> 15:25.696
20 years on the job,
you think you've seen it all.

15:25.764 --> 15:28.366
The rest of the team
should be here within the hour.

15:28.433 --> 15:30.067
Sheriff Mitchell,
Agent Rossi.

15:30.135 --> 15:31.862
We're getting you folks
set up over

15:31.887 --> 15:33.102
at the county sheriff's office.

15:33.103 --> 15:34.204
Thank you.

15:34.272 --> 15:35.205
You the one that found her?

15:35.273 --> 15:36.373
Yes, sir.

15:36.440 --> 15:38.308
I was making my rounds
about 4:00 in the morning.

15:38.376 --> 15:39.876
I've never seen anything
like it.

15:39.943 --> 15:42.379
The blood.
Bugs all over the place.

15:42.446 --> 15:44.414
Doors and windows open
when you discovered the body?

15:44.482 --> 15:45.549
No, sir. I checked.

15:45.616 --> 15:47.316
Found this in the car.

15:47.384 --> 15:48.584
Bite marks.

15:48.652 --> 15:51.654
The co-worker's
ready for you.

16:00.029 --> 16:01.897
Yeah, that's him.

16:03.566 --> 16:04.632
You know who he is?

16:04.700 --> 16:06.033
No, not yet.

16:06.101 --> 16:09.437
There was a cut
on his jaw, though.

16:09.505 --> 16:11.673
He had a bandage,
but it was bloody.

16:11.740 --> 16:15.042
Fresh blood, like
it had just happened.

16:15.110 --> 16:18.112
When he left, did he
get into a car or...

16:18.180 --> 16:19.479
I didn't see him go.

16:19.547 --> 16:22.148
I just thought
he was like, you know,

16:22.217 --> 16:24.685
homeless guy or something,
he wanted free food.

16:24.752 --> 16:26.052
He asked for food?

16:26.120 --> 16:27.887
Yeah. He said
it was his birthday.

16:27.955 --> 16:30.123
He got really weird
and intense

16:30.191 --> 16:31.891
when Brianna asked him
for his I.D.

16:31.959 --> 16:33.327
How so?

16:33.394 --> 16:35.228
Well, he went on and on
about how nobody

16:35.295 --> 16:38.364
would ever lie about
the day they were born.

16:38.432 --> 16:41.234
I mean, Brianna
gave him the pie anyway.

16:41.301 --> 16:45.037
Did this man at any point
refer to Brianna by another name?

16:45.105 --> 16:48.207
Yeah. I completely
forgot about that.

16:48.275 --> 16:50.575
He called her Carol.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.444
Okay.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.380
Well, we appreciate all
your help, Ms. Carson.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.048
If you can remember
anything else,

16:57.116 --> 16:59.217
please, give us a call.

17:27.578 --> 17:31.281
[Buzzing]

17:35.753 --> 17:37.821
So the unsub recognizes
his victims,

17:37.889 --> 17:39.421
but he calls them
by a different name.

17:39.489 --> 17:41.190
What's that about?

17:41.258 --> 17:42.524
The guy's schizophrenic,
maybe.

17:42.592 --> 17:44.526
No, the killings are too organized
and methodical.

17:44.594 --> 17:46.461
These people are
probably surrogates.

17:46.529 --> 17:49.608
Garcia can't find any
late-blooming Russell Smith

17:49.633 --> 17:50.599
wannabes out there.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.502
At least nobody
on law enforcement radar.

17:53.569 --> 17:55.369
You know, using a stick
as a gag maybe have simply

17:55.437 --> 17:57.172
been a convenience at
the first two crime scenes.

17:57.239 --> 17:59.573
The unsub was in the forest
and they were handy.

17:59.641 --> 18:00.975
But he specifically
brought a stick with him

18:01.043 --> 18:02.310
to the most recent
crime scene.

18:02.377 --> 18:04.745
It's a ritual that mirrors
Russell Smith's very closely.

18:04.814 --> 18:07.182
Also, there's something
strange about the fly larvae

18:07.249 --> 18:08.683
that was found in the car.

18:08.750 --> 18:11.451
You mean besides the fact
that there was fly larvae in the car.

18:11.519 --> 18:14.054
Well, that, and it was laid
by Lucilia mexicana flies.

18:14.122 --> 18:15.755
Meaning what?
It's a species unique

18:15.824 --> 18:17.424
to the southwestern
United States

18:17.491 --> 18:18.926
and the dry desert climates
of Latin America.

18:18.993 --> 18:21.628
There's no way it would be found
along the Gulf Coast

18:21.696 --> 18:24.631
unless it was brought here.

18:24.699 --> 18:27.333
I think I know
what's going on.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.634
Enlighten us.

18:28.702 --> 18:30.837
DNA from the maggot
stomach crop at both crime scenes

18:30.904 --> 18:32.839
revealed not only
skunk and raccoon meat,

18:32.906 --> 18:34.673
but traces of engine oil.

18:34.741 --> 18:36.642
I think this unsub
is seeding his victims

18:36.710 --> 18:40.579
with aged maggots
reared on animal remains.

18:40.647 --> 18:41.881
Road kill.

18:48.254 --> 18:51.122
[Doorbell rings]

18:54.961 --> 18:56.094
Can I help you?

18:56.162 --> 18:57.929
I'm looking for Ted.

18:57.997 --> 19:00.931
Sorry. You must have
the wrong house.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.485
Kyle.

19:22.552 --> 19:24.119
Are you okay?

19:24.187 --> 19:25.388
You must be Ted's wife.

19:25.455 --> 19:26.756
[Gasps] Oh, my God!

19:26.823 --> 19:28.891
No. Stop right there.

19:30.026 --> 19:32.160
So far, the unsub's
not trying hard

19:32.228 --> 19:34.196
to hide anything from us.

19:34.264 --> 19:37.999
What if December 11th
actually is his birthday,

19:38.066 --> 19:39.300
like he told the waitress?

19:39.368 --> 19:40.835
The unsub's in his
mid- to late 20s.

19:40.903 --> 19:43.671
It means he was born
between 1987 and 1992.

19:43.739 --> 19:45.540
Reid, get Garcia on it.

19:45.608 --> 19:47.842
Tell her to narrow the search
to those with a criminal background

19:47.910 --> 19:49.511
who live in the
southwestern United States,

19:49.578 --> 19:50.745
someone with a history

19:50.770 --> 19:52.613
of vandalizing churches 
or religious shrines

19:52.614 --> 19:54.347
and someone
who's also worked with

19:54.416 --> 19:57.150
or is at least
familiar with insects.

20:02.290 --> 20:04.324
Who are you?

20:07.929 --> 20:11.163
How do you know Ted?

20:11.231 --> 20:13.332
You mean your husband?

20:13.400 --> 20:16.201
We've known each other
for years and years.

20:17.771 --> 20:20.105
And years.

20:20.173 --> 20:22.508
How old are you?

20:25.244 --> 20:26.511
Where is he?

20:26.579 --> 20:28.012
My husband is dead.

20:28.080 --> 20:29.681
What?

20:29.749 --> 20:32.717
He died of--of cancer.

20:32.785 --> 20:33.718
You're lying.

20:33.786 --> 20:35.320
I'm not.

20:35.387 --> 20:37.388
I live here alone now.
I rent rooms to college students

20:37.457 --> 20:41.124
to help with expenses.

20:41.192 --> 20:44.795
I'm going to give you
one last chance to tell the truth.

20:44.863 --> 20:47.598
And I mean it better be
the truth.

20:47.666 --> 20:50.067
When did he die?

20:50.134 --> 20:52.402
Uh--um--
it was a long time ago.

20:52.471 --> 20:54.071
I need to know
exactly when.

20:54.138 --> 20:55.072
1999.

20:55.139 --> 20:56.607
It was May 12, 1999.

20:56.675 --> 20:57.740
Morning or night?

20:57.808 --> 20:59.309
What?

20:59.377 --> 21:00.410
Morning or night?

21:00.478 --> 21:01.511
Night. It was night.

21:01.579 --> 21:02.712
What difference
does it make?

21:02.780 --> 21:03.713
Where? At home?

21:03.781 --> 21:04.814
No, at the hospital.

21:04.882 --> 21:06.616
Which one?

21:06.684 --> 21:07.617
Um...

21:07.685 --> 21:09.252
Tell me which hospital!

21:09.320 --> 21:11.355
Escambia Memorial!

21:14.757 --> 21:16.570
Do you have any idea
how many people are born

21:16.595 --> 21:17.893
on earth every day?

21:17.894 --> 21:21.130
358,197 approximately.

21:21.198 --> 21:23.165
I did not like the answer
to that question. My point--

21:23.233 --> 21:24.666
even if narrowed way, way down,

21:24.734 --> 21:26.502
none of these fit
the profile of our unsub.

21:26.569 --> 21:28.137
If December 11th
really is his birthday,

21:28.205 --> 21:29.871
he's kept
his nose clean so far.

21:29.938 --> 21:32.707
The unsub told Brianna
that there was no more important day

21:32.774 --> 21:34.376
in one's life than
the day you were born.

21:34.443 --> 21:36.744
It has to somehow be part
of his methodology.

21:36.812 --> 21:40.048
How about the birthdays
of Russell Smith's earlier victims,

21:40.116 --> 21:42.250
the 8 prostitutes?

21:42.318 --> 21:43.584
You could be right.
Anniversary kills.

21:43.652 --> 21:45.185
Selecting victims who share
the same birthdays

21:45.253 --> 21:47.221
as those who went before.

21:47.288 --> 21:48.788
What is it, Hotch?

21:48.856 --> 21:51.158
The new wound
on the unsub's jaw--

21:51.226 --> 21:53.160
it wasn't there when he spoke
to the neighbor in Gulfport,

21:53.228 --> 21:55.595
and there's no evidence that any
of the victims put up resistance.

21:55.663 --> 21:58.499
Well, it could be an accident.
Accidents do happen.

21:58.566 --> 22:00.088
Or it was an interim victim
we don't know about yet

22:00.113 --> 22:01.401
who did fight back.

22:01.402 --> 22:03.669
Garcia, can you find
a file photo of Russell Smith?

22:03.737 --> 22:04.904
Yeah.

22:05.906 --> 22:07.473
Uh-oh.

22:07.541 --> 22:10.809
I'm sending these pictures
to your monitors right now.

22:12.779 --> 22:14.980
Reid: Our unsub's wound
was self-inflicted.

22:15.049 --> 22:17.482
He's not trying to
emulate Russell Smith.

22:17.550 --> 22:20.519
He's trying to turn himself
into Russell Smith.

22:21.887 --> 22:24.356
You've all been given copies
of the sketch of the suspect.

22:24.424 --> 22:27.159
They need to be distributed
to all law enforcement officials

22:27.226 --> 22:28.093
in the tri-state area.

22:28.161 --> 22:29.661
All of the unsub's
kills so far

22:29.728 --> 22:31.930
have been in different cities
and different states.

22:31.997 --> 22:34.265
We don't have to worry
about flushing him out.

22:34.332 --> 22:37.668
He's operating in the open
with confidence bordering on arrogance.

22:46.611 --> 22:49.379
We don't know why,
but he's been leaving

22:49.447 --> 22:51.948
large amounts of insects
behind at his crime scenes.

22:52.015 --> 22:54.684
Normally, that would be
a forensic countermeasure,

22:54.751 --> 22:57.387
artificially accelerating
infestation of the corpse.

22:57.455 --> 23:00.990
Or symbolically to degrade
and humiliate the victims.

23:10.666 --> 23:13.602
But these larvae are serving
some other purpose to the unsub.

23:13.669 --> 23:15.131
It's like an obsession.

23:15.156 --> 23:17.254
They are an essential
component to his kills.

23:17.340 --> 23:18.457
We believe he's slowly

23:18.482 --> 23:20.718
turning himself into
the image of Russell Smith,

23:20.977 --> 23:24.011
an Alabama serial killer
who's been dead for nearly 25 years.

23:24.079 --> 23:26.114
The unsub recently
cut himself on the jaw

23:26.181 --> 23:28.249
to replicate
a similar scar on Smith.

23:28.317 --> 23:31.119
JJ: And he may continue
to alter his appearance.

23:31.186 --> 23:33.821
Russell Smith had several
distinctive scorpion tattoos.

23:33.888 --> 23:36.290
Parlors in the region should
be notified to be on the lookout

23:36.358 --> 23:38.558
for customers requesting
these tattoos.

23:38.627 --> 23:41.695
Curiously, the unsub seems to
know precisely who he's looking for,

23:41.763 --> 23:44.531
but he refers to his victims
by a different name.

23:44.599 --> 23:47.835
Which means he's either
delusional or he's using these victims

23:47.902 --> 23:50.971
as substitutes for
someone else. Surrogates.

23:51.039 --> 23:53.040
The larvae he's depositing
at the crime scenes

23:53.108 --> 23:56.109
are indigenous to the
southwestern United States.

23:56.176 --> 23:58.778
So be on the lookout
for suspicious vehicles

23:58.846 --> 24:02.314
with either Arizona, Nevada,
or New Mexico license plates.

24:02.382 --> 24:04.651
Russell Smith preyed
exclusively on prostitutes

24:04.718 --> 24:06.385
and killed infrequently.

24:06.453 --> 24:07.987
8 victims in a 20-year period.

24:08.055 --> 24:11.723
But this unsub is killing at a rate
of one victim every other day,

24:11.791 --> 24:13.358
and he's targeting
ordinary citizens.

24:13.425 --> 24:14.960
No one is safe.

24:15.028 --> 24:18.563
[Indistinct chatter]

24:42.023 --> 24:42.957
Through all the birthdays,

24:43.024 --> 24:44.391
no match between
old and new victims.

24:44.768 --> 24:46.536
It looks like we've been
going down the wrong road.

24:47.305 --> 24:49.239
It may have been the right road
in the wrong direction.

24:49.306 --> 24:51.774
Garcia, what do the initials
T.L. stand for?

24:51.842 --> 24:53.943
T.L. that would be

24:54.011 --> 24:55.245
Taylor Lynn.

24:55.312 --> 24:58.614
Rossi: The unsub kept calling
Clayton Taylor

24:58.682 --> 25:00.483
and Brianna Carol.

25:00.550 --> 25:03.353
When did Smith kill
Carol Hansen?

25:03.420 --> 25:05.320
I need an exact date.

25:05.388 --> 25:09.457
Killed? That would be
March 28, 1979.

25:11.627 --> 25:14.562
That's it. The murder date
of the original victim

25:14.630 --> 25:16.331
matches the birthdate
of the new one.

25:16.399 --> 25:17.432
Garcia?

25:17.500 --> 25:18.800
I'm all over it. Okay.

25:18.868 --> 25:20.502
Taylor Lynn Grover,

25:20.569 --> 25:22.236
killed February 5, 1985.

25:22.304 --> 25:23.919
Were any of Smith's
original victims killed

25:23.944 --> 25:25.406
the day Floressa was born?

25:25.407 --> 25:27.041
Yes. Patty Johnson.

25:27.109 --> 25:28.776
She was Smith's first victim.

25:28.843 --> 25:31.145
She was murdered
on October 9, 1967.

25:31.213 --> 25:32.738
What do you want to bet

25:32.763 --> 25:35.187
our killer thought Floressa
was named Patty?

25:35.250 --> 25:38.318
So this unsub thinks his new victims
are Smith's old victims.

25:38.386 --> 25:40.220
Garcia, what about locations?

25:40.288 --> 25:42.918
Where did Patty Johnson,
Taylor Lynn Grover,

25:42.943 --> 25:44.257
and Carol Hansen die?

25:44.258 --> 25:46.092
Okay. Okay. Hold on.
Give me a sec.

25:46.160 --> 25:48.028
They were all murdered
in Alabama. In order--

25:48.095 --> 25:50.263
Mobile, Birmingham, Gadsden.

25:50.331 --> 25:52.998
And where were Floressa,
Clayton, and Brianna born?

25:53.066 --> 25:56.168
Also in order--
Mobile, Birmingham...

25:56.236 --> 25:57.265
and, oh, my God, Gadsden.

25:57.290 --> 25:59.138
Exact same places,
exact same dates.

25:59.139 --> 26:02.173
That's it.
Patty, Taylor, and Carol

26:02.241 --> 26:05.677
were all killed
only to be born to live again.

26:05.745 --> 26:09.180
This is about reincarnation.

26:16.688 --> 26:19.022
What are you
going to do to me?

26:31.235 --> 26:37.073
So, this killer believes that
Smith's victims  didn't really die,

26:37.140 --> 26:40.477
but hopped into a newborn life
and kept on living.

26:40.544 --> 26:42.760
Exactly. Reincarnated
as Floressa,

26:42.785 --> 26:44.514
Charlie Clayton, and Brianna.

26:44.515 --> 26:48.049
So what's he doing now,
killing them all over again?

26:48.117 --> 26:49.551
That's how it looks.

26:49.619 --> 26:52.020
But...he believes
in reincarnation, right?

26:52.088 --> 26:53.455
Who's to say that
these new victims

26:53.523 --> 26:55.924
haven't just jumped into
somebody else's body,

26:55.992 --> 26:57.759
the way he believes they did
the first time?

26:57.827 --> 26:59.761
Well, maybe in his mind
they already have.

26:59.829 --> 27:02.230
See, a fundamental tenet
of reincarnation

27:02.298 --> 27:05.666
is that you can come back
in any life form, not just human.

27:05.734 --> 27:07.335
That would explain
the larvae.

27:07.403 --> 27:10.171
This unsub is introducing
a newly hatched life form

27:10.239 --> 27:11.739
next to the victims
as he kills them.

27:11.807 --> 27:13.674
It's a new life form
waiting right there,

27:13.742 --> 27:16.811
ready to receive the spirit
of the one that just died.

27:16.879 --> 27:19.114
He thinks that
the people he's killing

27:19.181 --> 27:20.747
get reincarnated
as flies?

27:20.815 --> 27:24.018
He's making sure they don't
come back in human form again.

27:24.085 --> 27:26.420
Ensuring that this death
ends the cycle.

27:26.488 --> 27:29.223
If he believes it about the victims,
he must believe it about himself.

27:29.290 --> 27:32.026
Garcia, can you find out exactly
 where and when Russell Smith died,

27:32.093 --> 27:35.529
and then see who was born
in the same place at the same time?

27:35.596 --> 27:38.398
Russell Smith died
January 19, 1988.

27:38.465 --> 27:39.899
Tuscaloosa. Shot.

27:39.966 --> 27:41.867
Taken to Hobson Regional
Medical Center.

27:41.935 --> 27:43.903
Willie Kestler.

27:43.970 --> 27:46.506
Born exact same day,
exact same hospital.

27:46.573 --> 27:47.806
Do you have an address
for Kestler?

27:47.874 --> 27:50.743
It is...it's not local.

27:50.810 --> 27:52.210
Uh, 3088 Lakehawk Street,

27:52.278 --> 27:54.479
Apartment 5,
Chandler, Arizona.

27:54.547 --> 27:57.815
I'm sending it to you now.
You got a photo?

27:58.784 --> 27:59.784
That's our guy.

27:59.852 --> 28:01.520
Does Kestler have a vehicle?

28:01.587 --> 28:03.788
Mm-hmm. He's the registered
owner of a Ford Bronco,

28:03.856 --> 28:05.490
1989, green,

28:05.558 --> 28:08.759

28:08.826 --> 28:11.262

enforcement within a 200-mile radius.

28:11.329 --> 28:12.329
I'm on it.

28:12.397 --> 28:13.630
Thanks, Garcia.

28:23.675 --> 28:26.242
How come you're doing this?

28:28.680 --> 28:32.115
It's that voice
in your head.

28:32.183 --> 28:34.484
The one you can't
figure out.

28:35.687 --> 28:38.521
I don't have a voice
in my head.

28:38.590 --> 28:40.557
You do.

28:42.258 --> 28:45.094
Maybe it's not as loud
for you as it was for me.

28:45.161 --> 28:49.498
For a long time
I didn't understand.

28:49.566 --> 28:51.701
It was like...

28:51.768 --> 28:54.704
There was me...

28:54.771 --> 28:56.671
Then there was
another me.

28:59.408 --> 29:01.309
Then a few years ago,

29:01.376 --> 29:04.212
right before he died,

29:04.279 --> 29:08.016
my grandpa told me something
that made it all clear.

29:09.518 --> 29:11.820
It was about what happened
to me the day I was born.

29:11.887 --> 29:14.488
[Screaming]

29:14.555 --> 29:17.390
I was supposed to be born
two weeks before.

29:17.458 --> 29:18.826
But I wouldn't come.

29:18.893 --> 29:20.327
[Screaming]

29:20.394 --> 29:22.663
And then when I did...

29:22.731 --> 29:26.166
things got all...
tangled up inside.

29:30.371 --> 29:33.573
They had to rip my mama open
to get me out.

29:35.543 --> 29:37.344
But that was okay.

29:39.046 --> 29:41.615
I had to wait to be born
for a reason.

29:44.885 --> 29:47.553
There was a man who
got shot that very day.

29:47.621 --> 29:49.688
A killer.

29:49.756 --> 29:51.290
Russell Smith.

30:05.103 --> 30:08.773
You can't explain
things like this.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.876
It just happens.

30:11.943 --> 30:13.278
It happened to me.

30:13.345 --> 30:15.112
It could happen to you.

[Crying]

[Monitor flatlines]

30:39.135 --> 30:41.904
My mama died when
I was 5 years old

30:41.971 --> 30:43.406
and I had to go live
with that bastard.

30:43.473 --> 30:48.244
Old man used to smack me
around all the time.

30:48.312 --> 30:51.246
No reason.

My grandpa always said
I had the devil inside me.

31:00.456 --> 31:02.924
The soul of a killer.

31:05.027 --> 31:06.727
That's crazy.

31:06.794 --> 31:08.962
No.

31:09.030 --> 31:10.764
It wasn't crazy at all.

31:12.100 --> 31:16.604
After I heard that story,
it all made sense.

31:16.671 --> 31:19.940
The voice in my head.

31:23.176 --> 31:27.046
There was only ever one
real me all the time.

31:31.685 --> 31:33.486
That's who I am.

[Cell phone rings]

31:39.626 --> 31:40.925
What have you got, Garcia?

Chandler P.D. says Kestler's
apartment is empty,

31:43.095 --> 31:45.464
but they found stacks and stacks
of books about reincarnation.

31:45.531 --> 31:48.467
All right. Do the math with each
of Smith's other 5 victims.

31:48.534 --> 31:50.636
Find out who was born
the same place at the same time

31:50.703 --> 31:51.793
that each was murdered.

31:51.818 --> 31:53.604
That's who Kestler will be
going after next.

31:53.605 --> 31:55.072
Yes, sir. But this is gonna
take a while.

31:55.140 --> 31:56.907
Please put on
your hat of patience.

31:56.975 --> 31:58.242
Yeah.
Hurry.

31:59.911 --> 32:02.079
We need to take
a ride now.

32:02.147 --> 32:03.514
Don't hurt me. Please.

32:03.582 --> 32:06.116
It's not that I want to.

32:06.184 --> 32:09.653
Maybe I am Russell Smith.

32:09.720 --> 32:12.822
But it didn't mean
I had to be a killer again.

32:12.890 --> 32:14.457
What are you talking about?

32:14.525 --> 32:17.226
I mean, the whole point
of reincarnation

32:17.295 --> 32:19.162
is that you're supposed
to come back

32:19.229 --> 32:21.197
and be better
than you were before.

32:21.265 --> 32:22.365
Work on your karma.

32:22.433 --> 32:24.668
What I'm doing now,

32:24.735 --> 32:27.469
it's self-defense.

32:27.537 --> 32:29.371
One of you found out
where I was,

32:29.439 --> 32:33.442
and you tried to come and
cut off my brakes and kill me.

32:33.510 --> 32:36.211
So I had to find you.

32:36.279 --> 32:38.547
All 8 of you.

32:38.615 --> 32:40.115

I promise I won't
tell anybody.

You're gonna scream
your head off, aren't you?

As soon as we open the door,

32:52.828 --> 32:54.228
you're gonna make
a run for it.

32:54.296 --> 32:56.130
No.

I don't believe you.

32:58.199 --> 32:59.433
No...

Maybe we should just
do this right here.

No. No, don't.

Bad, bad news.

33:06.641 --> 33:07.674
What is it?

33:07.742 --> 33:09.343
There are 22 possible people

33:09.410 --> 33:10.844
our unsub
could be going after,

33:10.911 --> 33:12.346
and they are scattered
everywhere.

I mean everywhere.

33:13.580 --> 33:15.013

to Pennsylvania--

33:15.081 --> 33:17.182
Any in the Pensacola area?

33:17.250 --> 33:18.718
[Sighs] No.

33:18.785 --> 33:20.018
There's a Ted Sissler,

33:20.086 --> 33:22.955
who was born the same day
in the same place

33:23.022 --> 33:24.690
as one of the older
victims from Pensacola,

33:24.758 --> 33:25.924
but he died 13 years ago.

33:25.992 --> 33:27.426
Well, that's good, then,
right?

33:27.494 --> 33:28.994
One less person he's gonna
want to hunt down and kill.

33:29.062 --> 33:30.362
No, that's bad.

33:30.396 --> 33:32.196
Sheriff, check to see
if any 13-year-olds

33:32.264 --> 33:33.931
went missing
in the last 24 hours,

33:33.999 --> 33:35.734
and if Ted Sissler
has any family in the area,

33:35.801 --> 33:37.301
put them into protective
custody immediately.

33:37.370 --> 33:40.572
So, Kestler has
no criminal record,

33:40.639 --> 33:43.107
but he has been on the
Chandler P.D. radar recently.

33:43.175 --> 33:44.442
Why?
3 months ago

33:44.510 --> 33:46.209
he was injured
in a solo car crash.

33:46.277 --> 33:47.378
Claims someone
cut his brake lines

33:47.445 --> 33:49.346
and he wanted the police
to figure out who did it.

33:49.414 --> 33:50.514
And?

33:50.582 --> 33:52.115
Investigation turned up
no evidence of foul play.

33:52.183 --> 33:54.385
But the police said Kestler
was obsessed over it.

33:54.452 --> 33:57.454
He kept showing up for weeks
saying someone was after him.

33:57.522 --> 33:59.155
Well, that must have been
the trigger.

33:59.223 --> 34:00.724
Reincarnation
cuts both ways.

34:00.792 --> 34:02.224
Kestler thought
Smith's old victims

34:02.292 --> 34:03.325
were coming back
to get him.

34:03.394 --> 34:05.027
Rossi:
He's a psychopath.

34:05.095 --> 34:07.363
Aidan Donahue,
13 years old.

34:07.431 --> 34:09.931
Parents said he never
came home from school today.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.201
[Text message beep]

34:12.268 --> 34:14.804
Kestler's car was spotted
at a downtown motel.

34:14.871 --> 34:16.338
Let's go.

34:18.440 --> 34:20.442
[Gasps]

34:35.690 --> 34:37.190
Come here.

34:37.257 --> 34:40.428
No. No, no...

35:13.192 --> 35:15.427
Aidan, it's all right.
We're the FBI.

35:15.495 --> 35:17.463
We're the good guys.
Are you okay?

35:19.065 --> 35:20.933
The man that was here,
where did he go?

35:21.000 --> 35:22.500
I don't know.

35:22.568 --> 35:25.636
He just...took off.

35:25.704 --> 35:27.104
Did he say
where he was going?

35:27.172 --> 35:29.841
No. Only that
this wasn't over.

35:29.908 --> 35:31.509
He was gonna come back.

35:31.577 --> 35:33.778
Here? He was gonna
come back here to this room?

35:33.846 --> 35:35.847
No. The guy was crazy.

35:35.914 --> 35:38.615
He said he was coming back
in 20 years.

35:38.683 --> 35:42.218
He'd come back
and get me in 20 years.

35:44.455 --> 35:46.590
I think I know
where he's going.

35:59.068 --> 36:04.239
[Indistinct P.A.]

36:06.476 --> 36:07.876
Can I help you?

36:07.943 --> 36:10.045
Yes. I'm looking for
the delivery rooms.

36:10.113 --> 36:11.579
Is your wife
having a baby?

36:11.647 --> 36:12.747
Yes.

36:12.815 --> 36:14.749
Patient's name?

36:14.817 --> 36:16.384
Just tell me
where they are.

36:16.451 --> 36:18.352
Sir, only family members
are allowed back in the delivery area.

36:18.420 --> 36:19.620
Now.

36:19.687 --> 36:21.322
Sir, I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

36:24.059 --> 36:25.226
[Screaming]

36:32.192 --> 36:34.461
P.A.: Attention.
All hospital personnel

36:34.529 --> 36:35.812
and visitors immediately

36:35.837 --> 36:38.692
proceed to the nearest
exit in an orderly fashion.

36:39.199 --> 36:41.468
Repeat--leave the building
immediately.

36:41.536 --> 36:43.904
Do not interfere
with law enforcement.

36:43.971 --> 36:45.305
It's gonna be okay.

36:45.372 --> 36:47.239
Just breathe.

36:48.074 --> 36:49.742
Ohh!

36:49.810 --> 36:53.979
P.A.: Only authorized personnel
may transport patients.

36:54.047 --> 36:58.050
Repeat--only authorized personnel
may transport patients.

37:00.053 --> 37:01.921
Ohh!
You can't be in here.

37:01.988 --> 37:03.888
The baby.

37:03.956 --> 37:05.289
Where is it?

37:21.606 --> 37:25.041
[Baby crying]

37:25.109 --> 37:27.711
Get out.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.713
Get out.

37:29.781 --> 37:33.484
[Baby crying]

37:43.360 --> 37:47.229
Hotch: Put the baby down
and drop your weapon.

37:47.297 --> 37:48.631
[Baby crying]

37:48.699 --> 37:51.299
Willie Kestler, it's over.

37:51.367 --> 37:53.702
There's nowhere to run.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.728
Ohh!
No!

38:20.795 --> 38:23.429
Hotch: Agent down.
Get a doctor in here.

38:23.497 --> 38:26.733
[Baby crying]

38:29.069 --> 38:31.604
No.

38:38.945 --> 38:40.445
No.

38:40.513 --> 38:42.480
No.

38:42.549 --> 38:46.018
No...

38:52.358 --> 38:55.092
Rossi: "The doctrine of
the immortality of the soul

38:55.160 --> 38:57.394
has more threat
than comfort."

38:57.462 --> 38:59.697
Mason Cooley.

39:09.808 --> 39:11.608
When did you get back?
No one told me you got back

39:11.709 --> 39:12.909
and I've been worried
like crazy.

39:12.977 --> 39:14.343
Because they said
you were shot, with bullets.

39:14.411 --> 39:15.445
I'm fine.

39:15.512 --> 39:17.480
I can't believe
you were shot with bu--

39:17.548 --> 39:19.849
I got shot in my bulletproof
vest, baby girl.

39:19.917 --> 39:21.685
It's just a couple bruises.
I'm okay.

39:21.752 --> 39:24.187
Why don't they make better vests?
That's not bulletproof.

39:24.254 --> 39:26.255
It's like when you fall in the pool
and your watch stops working.

39:26.323 --> 39:29.424
That's water-resistant, not waterproof.
They should--

39:29.492 --> 39:32.895
I'm just fine.
See? It's just a couple bruises.

39:34.330 --> 39:37.666
How--how long do you
have to be taped up like this?

39:37.734 --> 39:39.468
I don't know.
A couple days, maybe.

39:39.535 --> 39:41.336
Oh. Okay.

39:41.404 --> 39:42.605
Are you relaxed now?

39:42.672 --> 39:44.539
Yeah. I'm relaxed.
Hey, if you need someone to

39:44.607 --> 39:46.941
help you, you know,
put new bindings on,

39:47.009 --> 39:49.043
rewrap or wrap, unwrap--

39:49.112 --> 39:51.079
Hey, you guys--oh!

39:51.147 --> 39:52.780
We... hey.

39:52.848 --> 39:55.283
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

39:56.852 --> 39:58.953
Hotch needs us
at the round table.

39:59.021 --> 40:00.421
Why? We just landed.

40:00.522 --> 40:02.590
He said it's important.

40:03.925 --> 40:07.661
[Whispering] It was nothing.
I wasn't doing anything.

40:13.101 --> 40:14.602
Yesterday while
we were in Florida,

40:14.669 --> 40:16.102
a body was found
in the desert

40:16.170 --> 40:18.271
outside Las Cruces,
New Mexico.

40:18.339 --> 40:20.273
A man had his leg
amputated

40:20.341 --> 40:22.542
and replaced with
the leg of someone else.

40:22.610 --> 40:24.611
And, as you know, last month
a body was found in Dallas

40:24.678 --> 40:26.012
with its mouth sewn shut,

40:26.079 --> 40:28.615
like the silencer.

40:28.682 --> 40:31.584
What looked then to be
a possible one-time copycat

40:31.652 --> 40:34.153
now has to be examined
in a different light.

40:34.220 --> 40:37.156
Someone's out there mimicking
the crimes we've solved.

40:37.223 --> 40:38.624
That's how it looks.

40:38.692 --> 40:40.760
This is now an active case,

40:40.827 --> 40:44.096
which we'll be investigating
along with our other cases.
