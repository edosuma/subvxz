00:51.281 --> 00:54.350
Even goin' to the barber's a problem.

00:54.617 --> 00:56.085
Yeah!

00:56.285 --> 00:58.387
Pieces of shit those alley kids!

00:58.554 --> 01:01.157
Their lookouts are everywhere.

01:01.991 --> 01:05.227
First they betray us,
then they hunt us down!

01:06.762 --> 01:08.564
I should have blown their heads off!

01:08.764 --> 01:09.798
You're right!

01:09.999 --> 01:11.500
Go check it out.

01:14.403 --> 01:15.404
It's clear.

01:17.806 --> 01:19.274
Mornin'.

01:20.475 --> 01:22.477
Isn't anyone in here?

01:22.678 --> 01:23.679
SasÃ !

01:39.494 --> 01:41.129
Things okay?

01:41.829 --> 01:43.431
Hurry!

01:47.001 --> 01:49.203
We don't see how they got so far.

01:52.940 --> 01:55.444
Maybe you shouldn't stay here.

01:56.644 --> 01:59.413
They move forward every day.

02:00.014 --> 02:02.016
Everyone knows where you are.

02:03.017 --> 02:04.418
Dad!

02:04.818 --> 02:07.020
Can we finish our game?

02:08.122 --> 02:10.090
Coming, wait for me in there.

02:17.431 --> 02:19.833
I'm not going anywhere.

03:06.011 --> 03:08.013
Don Pietro sends his compliments.

03:09.614 --> 03:11.416
Okay, but we want a spot.

03:11.616 --> 03:13.618
One thing at a time.

03:13.818 --> 03:15.420
First we get rid of Raffaele,

03:15.620 --> 03:17.822
but quietly. Cops are everywhere.

03:18.089 --> 03:19.357
Or we won't sell shit.

03:20.024 --> 03:21.426
Cops come and go.

03:21.626 --> 03:24.095
Sure, but people don't eat
when they're around,

03:24.329 --> 03:26.998
and we gotta get people on our side.

03:30.034 --> 03:32.436
I heard you had a baby boy.

03:33.037 --> 03:34.438
Congratulations.

03:37.441 --> 03:38.843
Let's go.

03:44.615 --> 03:46.617
He was born yesterday

03:46.817 --> 03:49.219
and these guys already know his name!

03:51.188 --> 03:53.190
How should I take that?

03:53.390 --> 03:55.192
Take it as a sign.

03:55.392 --> 03:57.994
We made the right choice, relax.

04:12.241 --> 04:15.712
Mulatto's own men killed him,
we can't trust anyone.

04:15.912 --> 04:18.180
- We gotta raise hell!
- Cool it, Raffaele!

04:18.380 --> 04:22.051
The fuck I will!
We wait 'til they kill another of us?

04:22.285 --> 04:26.222
We gotta find Savastano,
he's our problem.

04:26.422 --> 04:29.425
Think we're not trying, Gypsy?

04:29.625 --> 04:31.227
You all gotta stay calm.

04:33.429 --> 04:36.031
We're buying information.

04:39.301 --> 04:42.104
We get killed if we're not careful,

04:43.805 --> 04:45.440
or if we don't know who's around us.

04:52.213 --> 04:54.215
You know what I see?

04:55.216 --> 04:57.619
Two guys shitting their pants.

04:59.587 --> 05:03.257
We're the strongest, we have an army.

05:03.458 --> 05:05.660
We mustn't be afraid.

05:06.728 --> 05:10.131
Fear is
the only thing that can screw us.

06:02.782 --> 06:04.784
What a mess! I can't do
all the work myself.

06:05.017 --> 06:07.319
Anyway, we'll have to leave here
sooner or later.

06:08.420 --> 06:11.223
- We're safe here.
- Who says?

06:11.423 --> 06:12.424
You?

06:17.062 --> 06:19.464
C'mon, give me a hand,
let's clean up.

06:19.865 --> 06:23.468
Who the fuck are you
to tell us what to do?

06:24.236 --> 06:27.506
See the fucking mess
you got us into?

06:42.587 --> 06:43.988
Guys...

06:47.658 --> 06:49.660
I've been thinkin'.

06:56.067 --> 06:58.269
It's time to go back home.

07:00.271 --> 07:02.072
My father's home,

07:02.273 --> 07:03.841
ours,

07:04.675 --> 07:08.045
where you lived before this mess
with the Savastanos.

07:14.051 --> 07:16.253
We gotta step back.

07:17.587 --> 07:20.991
Now, that we still have
something to offer.

07:49.251 --> 07:50.553
Hello, Don Pietro.

07:50.753 --> 07:52.321
Hi, Patrizia.

07:55.557 --> 07:58.527
I still haven't thanked you
for the new house.

07:59.461 --> 08:01.063
Do you feel safer?

08:06.535 --> 08:08.937
My brothers and sisters
can't stand me anymore.

08:10.071 --> 08:12.040
And maybe they're right.

08:23.084 --> 08:26.888
They'll have no more problems
for the rest of their lives,

08:27.655 --> 08:29.457
I give you my word.

08:30.658 --> 08:32.326
Thank you, Don Pietro.

08:33.693 --> 08:36.563
Enough of calling me "Don Pietro",
what do you say?

08:43.037 --> 08:44.738
Your stuff has arrived.

08:45.606 --> 08:47.407
Should I see to it?

08:48.108 --> 08:50.010
Why don't you.

10:08.886 --> 10:11.088
We made a huge mistake, Don Pietro.

10:12.690 --> 10:16.260
- But we had no choice.
- A man always has a choice.

10:17.294 --> 10:20.297
And you, like Scianel,
made the wrong one.

10:20.931 --> 10:22.933
You took up with your father's killers.

10:29.273 --> 10:31.275
You sold your soul.

10:32.075 --> 10:33.977
Now, what do you want from me?

10:37.147 --> 10:38.748
Your forgiveness.

10:41.084 --> 10:43.486
Forgiveness and protection.

10:43.687 --> 10:47.357
- My spot...
- It's never been yours.

10:53.763 --> 10:56.165
I'll give it back, Don Pietro.

11:14.917 --> 11:16.718
Explain something:

11:17.319 --> 11:20.923
in exchange for forgiveness
you offer what's already mine?

11:21.123 --> 11:23.925
I'd have taken it myself,
sooner or later.

11:25.193 --> 11:28.597
You have to earn forgiveness
and protection, Gypsy.

11:31.499 --> 11:34.502
You gotta bring me that shit
Ciro di Marzio.

11:48.836 --> 11:51.105
What's Avitabile want from me?

11:51.305 --> 11:52.807
Don't worry, sir,

11:53.040 --> 11:56.043
Mr. Avitabile just wants a chat.

12:28.241 --> 12:29.242
Move it!

12:29.442 --> 12:31.844
Are you sure Avitabile's here?

12:32.445 --> 12:34.247
He's inside.

12:42.455 --> 12:44.423
Where the fuck
are you goin', you shit?

13:06.278 --> 13:09.080
You were supposed to scare him,
but you fucked up.

13:10.081 --> 13:12.484
Leave, I'll take care of Avitabile.

13:15.954 --> 13:17.555
Venezuela?

13:18.856 --> 13:22.293
Alfredo, you killed a Councilman.

13:23.261 --> 13:26.464
Thank God
Giuseppe didn't have us both killed.

13:29.667 --> 13:31.869
Now take that fucking plane

13:32.069 --> 13:35.072
and come back
only when I say so, hear me?

13:37.541 --> 13:38.943
Okay.

13:55.158 --> 13:59.162
We won all the lots: piers, wharfs,
accomodation facilities, the works!

13:59.396 --> 14:03.266
Nice work, Councilman!
We ass-fucked them.

14:03.466 --> 14:05.869
Now I'll leave you with your family.

14:06.236 --> 14:08.504
You'll get a token of my gratitude.

14:08.705 --> 14:10.306
Thank you, see you soon.

14:10.506 --> 14:11.908
Goodbye.

14:19.482 --> 14:21.884
It's construction work for more
than 200 million euros.

14:22.084 --> 14:24.487
Obviously we'll find a pretext
to renegotiate and double it.

14:24.687 --> 14:27.690
Everything through a clean,
immaculate company.

14:28.224 --> 14:31.226
Gennaro, without you and
the money we make with your stuff,

14:31.427 --> 14:33.328
this would never have gone through.

14:33.495 --> 14:36.398
Together you and me are a powerhouse.

14:36.598 --> 14:38.400
Are you joking, Giuseppe?

14:40.469 --> 14:42.671
I'm the one who thanks you.

14:43.472 --> 14:46.074
You taught me to use my head.

15:00.088 --> 15:01.956
Don Giuseppe!

15:02.156 --> 15:04.225
It's okay, we got rid of him.

15:05.059 --> 15:07.662
And my brother's leaving right away.

15:09.063 --> 15:10.464
Tommaso...

15:10.865 --> 15:13.868
if he wasn't your brother,
he'd be dead, know that?

15:14.068 --> 15:15.669
Yeah.

15:15.903 --> 15:18.906
Don Giuseppe,
I've been with you for 20 years,

15:19.473 --> 15:22.476
my word: Alfredo will disappear,
like the Councilman.

15:22.676 --> 15:25.078
It's all right, don't worry.

15:27.881 --> 15:29.283
Get out.

15:29.483 --> 15:30.851
Go!

15:33.820 --> 15:35.722
Everything's okay.

15:35.889 --> 15:39.693
- Anything we can take care of?
- Just your wedding.

15:40.627 --> 15:42.028
I'm so pleased,

15:42.228 --> 15:45.031
for the contract, for the wedding...

15:45.732 --> 15:47.534
for the baby...

15:48.268 --> 15:51.871
and that I kept you from
that slaughterhouse in Naples.

15:52.638 --> 15:54.607
You saved your life!

15:56.275 --> 15:58.044
Take it easy...

15:58.911 --> 16:00.313
Take care.

16:00.513 --> 16:02.882
- Bye, Giuseppe.
- Bye, Dad.

16:06.652 --> 16:09.054
Ciro, all set.

16:09.555 --> 16:11.523
We doubled everything.

16:11.724 --> 16:15.027
We took on more lookouts.

16:15.227 --> 16:19.031
We give more money for information.

16:21.566 --> 16:24.002
A thousand euros
if they hit a Savastano's man

16:24.236 --> 16:25.904
or anyone from the alley.

16:26.104 --> 16:29.507
Two thousand for a bigshot,
ten thousand for a boss.

16:30.008 --> 16:31.409
Ciro,

16:32.577 --> 16:35.780
Gypsy might know
where Savastano's hiding

16:36.281 --> 16:37.682
and he wants to meet you.

16:38.683 --> 16:39.684
Where?

16:39.884 --> 16:42.286
In the garage, like last time.

16:44.088 --> 16:45.490
Fine.

17:29.399 --> 17:31.834
Think, if we could find Don Pietro...

17:36.506 --> 17:38.507
It would all end.

18:04.299 --> 18:07.502
- Are they on foot or what?
- Who knows where they are!

18:17.512 --> 18:20.081
They just got there, seems okay.

18:21.482 --> 18:23.684
- How many cars?
- Two.

18:37.298 --> 18:40.701
He was too fuckin' scared to bring
just two cars and a few men.

18:45.472 --> 18:47.441
So? What do we do?

18:51.244 --> 18:53.046
We pray for his soul.

19:11.898 --> 19:13.900
Well? Are they coming?

19:14.100 --> 19:17.303
The guys called me, they went back.

19:24.110 --> 19:27.479
Get in your cars, c'mon!

19:27.713 --> 19:28.681
Fast!

20:12.623 --> 20:14.325
What is it, little guy?

20:14.525 --> 20:16.527
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Bomber.

20:20.331 --> 20:22.733
Honey, I have a few things to do,

20:22.933 --> 20:24.401
I'll see you later.

20:28.105 --> 20:29.473
Get inside!

20:29.673 --> 20:31.475
Don't move from here!

20:32.709 --> 20:34.111
Come on!

20:37.914 --> 20:39.716
Don't worry.

20:41.885 --> 20:44.487
I did what I could,

20:44.687 --> 20:46.289
but that asshole's too careful.

20:46.489 --> 20:48.691
We tried

20:48.891 --> 20:50.893
and we'll try again.

20:51.127 --> 20:53.730
Relax, it doesn't change
a fuck for you.

22:05.532 --> 22:08.936
We put the guys
of the building commission

22:09.136 --> 22:11.538
closer to Dad's table.

22:13.607 --> 22:15.842
We move these two

22:16.543 --> 22:18.545
and the two journalists...

22:18.812 --> 22:20.213
Journalists too?

22:20.680 --> 22:22.882
Your father pays them!

22:25.151 --> 22:27.220
He's right, power must be shown.

22:30.156 --> 22:33.926
It's odd how we don't know a soul
at our own wedding.

22:38.331 --> 22:39.932
But that's how it is.

22:40.967 --> 22:42.935
- I'm having a shower.
- Gennaro...

22:45.538 --> 22:47.540
You just look at me, that's all,

22:48.340 --> 22:51.944
and even in the middle of all those
people, it will be our wedding.

22:55.247 --> 22:57.015
You're so beautiful!

24:34.959 --> 24:36.961
Time is running out.

24:37.729 --> 24:40.331
You know my baby's on the way

24:41.599 --> 24:43.801
or do you mean the wedding?

24:44.535 --> 24:47.138
Your father's breaking up everything.

24:48.139 --> 24:50.741
It's just another way to say
you're losing, Ciro.

24:51.642 --> 24:53.911
We're all losing, Gennaro,

24:54.111 --> 24:55.513
but you most of all.

24:57.348 --> 24:59.550
It's a fucking mess down South,

25:00.651 --> 25:03.654
cops everywhere,
dead bodies all over,

25:05.155 --> 25:07.157
we're not selling anything.

25:08.759 --> 25:11.561
Do you think I'll have trouble
selling my stuff?

25:14.297 --> 25:16.099
It's a big world,

25:16.867 --> 25:19.069
and I don't give a fuck
about Secondigliano.

25:21.538 --> 25:23.740
That's crap,

25:25.308 --> 25:27.310
because you know

25:27.510 --> 25:30.113
whatever happens,
it's not good for you.

25:37.353 --> 25:39.155
If your father loses,

25:39.355 --> 25:42.558
they'll say it's your fault,
you destroyed everything.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.761
But if he wins,

25:46.695 --> 25:49.899
it means Dad had to come back
to set things right.

25:51.367 --> 25:53.335
You have just one chance,

25:53.535 --> 25:55.737
that chance is me.

25:59.308 --> 26:01.109
There's not much time.

26:20.328 --> 26:22.330
Give me your best wishes, Ciro.

26:37.745 --> 26:39.547
I know you,

26:40.547 --> 26:42.349
you're like me.

26:44.551 --> 26:47.154
This thing's eating your gut,

26:47.354 --> 26:49.156
like poison.

26:50.757 --> 26:52.726
It's consuming you.

26:57.731 --> 26:59.766
Thanks just the same, Ciro.

27:05.538 --> 27:07.540
Gennaro, you're like me.

27:54.552 --> 27:56.554
- Hello.
- Hello.

28:00.191 --> 28:01.993
Where's the bride?

28:05.730 --> 28:07.732
Will we be on time?

28:07.932 --> 28:09.533
Yes, don't worry.

28:10.768 --> 28:12.970
You look so good, Dad!

28:13.537 --> 28:16.740
Today I feel
there's a crown on my head.

28:16.941 --> 28:18.742
The seating is perfect.

28:18.943 --> 28:21.345
- Really? Are you happy?
- Yes.

28:21.545 --> 28:23.414
Now close your eyes.

28:23.614 --> 28:25.616
Close them!

28:31.388 --> 28:32.789
Open.

28:42.565 --> 28:44.801
They're so beautiful, Dad.

28:49.772 --> 28:51.174
Thank you.

28:52.575 --> 28:54.977
I should be thanking you,

28:55.178 --> 28:57.780
you know what
this wedding means to me.

28:57.980 --> 28:59.382
I do.

29:02.184 --> 29:04.854
Get ready,
don't keep the groom waiting!

29:05.054 --> 29:06.856
Okay, bye.

29:24.139 --> 29:25.540
Thank you.

29:26.374 --> 29:27.375
Good, Genny.

29:27.576 --> 29:29.377
Thank you so much, Don Aniello.

29:30.979 --> 29:32.981
- Best wishes.
- Thank you.

30:33.806 --> 30:36.275
I'm entrusting you
with what's most precious to me.

30:37.844 --> 30:39.445
I know.

30:45.751 --> 30:47.600
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:19.584 --> 31:23.788
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

31:23.955 --> 31:25.156
Amen.

32:00.790 --> 32:01.791
Stop!

32:03.059 --> 32:05.462
Down! Hit the ground!

32:05.628 --> 32:06.729
Down!

32:07.564 --> 32:09.766
Don't move!

32:11.801 --> 32:14.203
Join hands

32:14.404 --> 32:18.407
and express your consent
before God and His Church.

32:23.245 --> 32:27.650
I Gennaro, take you Azzurra,
to be my wedded wife.

32:27.883 --> 32:31.153
In Jesus' grace
I promise to be true to you,

32:31.353 --> 32:33.155
in good times and in bad,

32:33.355 --> 32:35.357
in sickness and in health.

32:35.557 --> 32:38.026
I will love you and honor you
all the days of my life.

32:41.797 --> 32:43.398
I Azzurra,

32:43.598 --> 32:46.001
take you Gennaro,
to be my wedded husband.

32:47.202 --> 32:51.206
In Jesus' grace
I promise to be true to you,

32:51.806 --> 32:53.608
in good times and in bad,

32:53.808 --> 32:55.877
in sickness and in health.

32:56.611 --> 33:00.582
I will love you and honor you
all the days of my life.

33:13.194 --> 33:14.995
Is this all right?

33:21.402 --> 33:23.837
Looks like I've always been here.

33:27.608 --> 33:29.676
Like nothing's changed.

33:33.513 --> 33:36.316
Don Pietro, my task is finished now,

33:37.384 --> 33:39.686
you don't need
a messenger any longer.

33:41.121 --> 33:43.723
But it's not true
that nothing's changed.

33:46.226 --> 33:47.627
It seems like that.

33:49.429 --> 33:53.032
Instead everything's changed
and we're not at the end of it.

33:54.233 --> 33:56.235
What do you mean?

33:56.435 --> 33:58.638
That I still need you.

34:00.239 --> 34:02.041
To do what?

34:02.842 --> 34:04.844
It's not over yet.

34:06.979 --> 34:10.382
Don Pietro, I'm not a soldier.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.021
This is a big house,

34:18.023 --> 34:20.726
I'd be pleased if you stayed here.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.632
Besides, it's even safer.

34:29.367 --> 34:31.335
So you don't have
to go back and forth.

34:38.246 --> 34:40.649
It's more than
15 million cubic meters.

34:40.849 --> 34:43.452
- We have enough work for an army.
- Good!

34:44.252 --> 34:46.054
Giuseppe, listen,

34:46.254 --> 34:50.324
they have been gone for that photo
shoot for an hour, do I call them?

34:50.525 --> 34:52.127
Go ahead.

34:52.726 --> 34:55.996
Aniello, now I'd like
to introduce the Councilman

34:56.231 --> 34:59.200
and another couple of people
who count, all my people.

34:59.400 --> 35:00.401
Councilman!

35:03.838 --> 35:05.640
He'll never forgive me.

35:08.442 --> 35:11.445
Azzurra, today I'm the most
important man in your life.

35:16.917 --> 35:19.320
And we even promised...

35:20.654 --> 35:24.057
to love and support each other
all the days of our lives.

35:24.258 --> 35:26.059
In fact, I'm here.

35:27.361 --> 35:29.029
To us, my love.

35:29.263 --> 35:31.431
To the life awaiting us.

35:38.505 --> 35:40.273
Still nothing?

35:40.974 --> 35:42.842
No, nothing.

35:43.043 --> 35:46.312
They don't answer, should I worry?

35:46.913 --> 35:49.315
I'll call, invite the guests in,

35:49.515 --> 35:52.418
and check they're all
sitting in the right places.

35:56.689 --> 35:59.091
Tommaso,
we have to find those two jerks!

35:59.292 --> 36:02.695
Find the driver and photographers.
I want to know where they are!

36:14.273 --> 36:15.874
You decide.

36:18.110 --> 36:20.612
I'm hungry, shall we order?

36:41.466 --> 36:44.735
Here I am! The kids are coming,
they were stuck in traffic.

36:46.070 --> 36:47.872
Then let's have a toast!

36:48.072 --> 36:49.874
A toast! Cheers!

36:50.474 --> 36:52.276
- Cheers!
- To the newlyweds!

36:53.477 --> 36:56.480
Those two assholes don't answer,
I sent Tommaso.

36:56.680 --> 36:58.682
It's odd,
something must have happened.

36:58.882 --> 37:00.884
- Are you Giuseppe Avitabile?
- I am.

37:01.085 --> 37:02.486
Come with us please.

37:03.253 --> 37:05.556
- Why, what's wrong?
- Our daughter?

37:05.756 --> 37:08.025
Your daughter has nothing
to do with this. Come with us.

37:08.258 --> 37:10.560
Now? At my daughter's wedding?

37:11.028 --> 37:13.830
We have a warrant for your arrest.
Please...

37:14.731 --> 37:16.900
Excuse me, I'm sure it's nothing.

37:17.100 --> 37:19.102
- No, wait...
- Quiet! Talk to the lawyer!

37:19.302 --> 37:20.704
Let's go!

37:21.504 --> 37:22.505
Excuse me.

37:22.706 --> 37:24.507
Don't get up.

37:24.707 --> 37:27.310
Relax, it's nothing.

38:12.821 --> 38:14.422
It's a serious accusation, Luisa.

38:14.622 --> 38:17.825
Alfredo Natale pleaded manslaughter
for the murder of the Councilman,

38:18.026 --> 38:19.427
meaning, involuntary,

38:19.627 --> 38:23.431
but he said Giuseppe was
the instigator of the intimidation.

38:23.664 --> 38:27.268
I see, but how did they connect it?
Hadn't that jerk left?

38:27.468 --> 38:29.370
I don't know,
he was arrested this morning.

38:29.537 --> 38:31.539
Who? Who knew?

38:31.772 --> 38:33.674
We couldn't care less, because

38:33.874 --> 38:37.278
now it's just Natale's word
against Giuseppe's.

38:37.478 --> 38:41.081
Without further proof,
they have to release him, and fast.

38:42.683 --> 38:44.485
I'll leave.

38:45.185 --> 38:46.186
Bye, Luisa.

38:47.254 --> 38:48.855
Bye, Azzurra.

39:48.980 --> 39:51.383
I'm sorry about your wedding.

39:51.583 --> 39:55.186
Don't worry, just get him out.

39:55.386 --> 39:58.990
Don't worry Gennaro, Alfredo Natale
knows nothing about the business

39:59.190 --> 40:01.192
and his brother
isn't the type to talk.

40:01.426 --> 40:03.428
At least the companies are safe.

40:04.095 --> 40:06.297
Meantime, I'll set up a meeting fast,

40:06.497 --> 40:09.500
so you'll know what to do
to run things.

40:11.102 --> 40:12.903
- Thank you, counselor.
- Don't mention it.

40:13.104 --> 40:14.705
I'll be in touch.
