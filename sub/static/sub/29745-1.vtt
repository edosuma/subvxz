WEBVTT

00:44.016 --> 00:44.866
Cut!

00:45.283 --> 00:46.650
What the fuck, Billy!

00:46.783 --> 00:48.750
My arms are tired, mon.
Can we please take a break?

00:48.783 --> 00:50.066
Your arms are tired?

00:50.150 --> 00:52.433
All right. Five minutes. Okay?

00:52.666 --> 00:55.166
- Have you been smoking?
- No, mon. It’s in my clothes.

00:55.216 --> 00:57.583
You know the deal. If you stay stoned,
you can’t stay on the set.

00:57.683 --> 00:58.583
Whatever!

01:00.983 --> 01:02.766
Akasha! Where the hell’s Akasha?

01:02.866 --> 01:05.616
She’s making blood for you. Right now.

01:05.650 --> 01:07.433
Jesus! Okay. You all right?

01:08.016 --> 01:09.650
There’s this one shot and we’re done for the day.

01:09.683 --> 01:12.449
I wish. I still have a twelve to
two shift at the club tonight.

01:12.533 --> 01:13.750
Te levo lá. Não se preocupe.

01:13.783 --> 01:16.550
I’ll get you there. Worry not.

01:16.650 --> 01:18.533
Hey, Shane. Do you want to go ahead and get another one?

01:23.816 --> 01:25.083
Yeah, okay.

01:25.816 --> 01:26.949
Okay. And ... ACTION.

01:57.250 --> 01:58.750
Acordou cedo.

02:10.383 --> 02:11.583
What está fazendo?

02:11.800 --> 02:13.383
Revisando diálogos.

02:13.783 --> 02:15.899
It’s too “on the nose.”

02:16.016 --> 02:16.850
Who says?

02:16.949 --> 02:18.133
Someone in the writers’ group.

02:18.399 --> 02:20.266
How many scripts has he sold?

02:20.300 --> 02:23.383
She. And maybe none.
But she talks like she knows a lot.

02:23.883 --> 02:26.149
Yeah, well, talk doesn’t always equal talent.

02:26.283 --> 02:30.466
She says that readers will shit-can a script
if it doesn’t have enough white space.

02:30.683 --> 02:32.866
Isn’t that the stupidest thing you’ve ever heard?

02:33.816 --> 02:36.366
I’m gonna make coffee. Do you work today?

02:36.600 --> 02:38.050
Yeah. You?

02:38.083 --> 02:40.649
Yeah. Until five. Do you want to eat out?

02:41.366 --> 02:42.649
Can we eat in?

02:43.633 --> 02:48.199
Sure. And when you’re done
venting, keep revising.

02:49.183 --> 02:51.550
You’re not beautiful when you’re rational.

02:55.100 --> 02:56.333
That’s good.

03:09.616 --> 03:12.000
Chloe, sweet sistah!

03:12.483 --> 03:15.016
What ‘cha doin’ knocking down me door at daybreak?

03:16.050 --> 03:18.399
Umm. Can you give the rent to Nelson today?

03:22.733 --> 03:25.183
Yeah. All right. I’ll hustle it up by noon.

03:56.766 --> 03:58.083
Aah! Sweet sacrament. (kissing sound)

03:59.566 --> 04:00.833
And … sent.

04:02.000 --> 04:02.933
Morning. You want coffee?

04:04.750 --> 04:06.966
Thanks, but I gotta run.

04:07.149 --> 04:09.050
Economics is kicking my ass.

04:09.133 --> 04:11.533
Plus I gotta meet up with my professor before the test.

04:11.600 --> 04:12.816
- Good Luck.
- Thanks.

04:13.449 --> 04:15.333
Oh, we’ll have rent for your dad tonight.

04:15.416 --> 04:18.399
Oh, it’s no problem. My dad’ll pay the owner.
I can pay him later.

04:18.899 --> 04:20.433
Okay

04:34.899 --> 04:36.149
What’ll it be, ladies?

04:36.233 --> 04:38.850
Hi..uh..can I get a …uh… two.. no….I’ll have the ….

04:40.700 --> 04:43.833
the blue organic corn tortilla.

04:44.916 --> 04:45.883
Wait, no.

04:46.116 --> 04:48.600
Yeah, that’s it. What do you want?

04:49.000 --> 04:49.899
Let me see..

04:51.116 --> 04:52.866
Oh my God! Stop!

04:52.950 --> 04:56.616
I want the black bean, baja cheese...

05:25.783 --> 05:26.866
Hello!!

05:27.866 --> 05:30.000
- Take the order please, thanks.
- Right away.

05:35.766 --> 05:38.416
Shane! Ai meu deus, Shane!

05:38.500 --> 05:41.616
Shane. Shane, my cat Bebe is up on the roof. (Unintelligible). She’s been up there for a day and a night with no water and no food. Can you please, please, please go up there and get her?

05:49.533 --> 05:51.416
Sure, Ms. K., I’ll save your cat.

05:51.516 --> 05:53.866
Okay. Put on these gloves. You’re gonna need them. And these goggles. Oh, and I’ve got some oysters. She loves oysters.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.866
Okay. Bebe! You’ve got this. You’ve really got this.

06:09.366 --> 06:12.016
Here kitty kitty kitty kitty.

06:13.983 --> 06:15.883
Here kitty kitty kitty kitty.

06:17.450 --> 06:18.283
Do you see her?

06:18.316 --> 06:20.733
Uh no, not quite.

06:20.816 --> 06:23.200
She’s a black with white. Kitty!

06:23.583 --> 06:25.850
Uh, yeah I see her

06:25.866 --> 06:27.649
What’s the look on her face?

06:29.516 --> 06:30.766
Uh… vengeance.

06:51.633 --> 06:52.983
dear sir.

06:53.316 --> 06:58.366
Big House Pictures, LLC, does
not accept unsolicited blah blah blah.

07:24.216 --> 07:25.383
Hey. What happened? So? It’s not your first. Thought we were going to start using these as wallpaper. Come on! You know it’s good. You made the finals at the New Orleans Horror Film Festival. We just have to keep sending it in.

07:25.383 --> 07:25.716
Hey. What happened? So? It’s not your first. Thought we were going to start using these as wallpaper. Come on! You know it’s good. You made the finals at the New Orleans Horror Film Festival. We just have to keep sending it in.
Why? No one’s gonna read it. I’m unrepped

07:25.716 --> 07:27.741
Why? No one’s gonna read it. I’m unrepped

07:28.253 --> 07:31.166
- What about more festivals?
- At fifty bucks a pop?

07:33.718 --> 07:35.443
- Yeah… How’s the new piece coming?
- Well…

07:37.470 --> 07:39.524
Enough with the self-pity. I hate seeing you like this.

07:39.841 --> 07:42.478
Yeah. Sure. Whatever.

07:42.691 --> 07:44.643
Start something new.
Anything.

07:46.263 --> 07:50.904
- Trust me on pizza?
- Sure.

07:52.146 --> 07:53.959
Yeah. Sure. Whatever.

08:05.598 --> 08:07.158
I figured what the hell

08:07.158 --> 08:09.559
I couldn’t sit around waiting for Hollywood to call.

08:09.781 --> 08:13.006
I knew I had a solid story.
I just decided to do it myself.

08:13.625 --> 08:16.796
And that’s how the Maine Machete Massacre
came to be. The rest as they say …

08:17.130 --> 08:19.043
The rest as they say …

08:20.019 --> 08:21.916
Chill, Brah.

08:21.916 --> 08:21.986
What happened?

08:21.986 --> 08:24.535
- Your imbecile brother nearly got us arrested.
- It was nothing.

08:24.535 --> 08:28.079
We was at a fucking red light. This motherfucker
took a goddam toke just when a cop car pulls up.

08:28.079 --> 08:29.923
He didn’t look at us.

08:30.579 --> 08:32.133
No harm, no foul, mon.

08:32.474 --> 08:35.553
You know what? I don’t understand. If that’s nothing,
I damn sure don’t want to see something.

08:38.033 --> 08:41.489
That man is wound way too tight.

09:07.979 --> 09:10.809
Não consigo a I can’t open it. It’s too tight.

10:24.914 --> 10:27.085
What? What is it?

10:28.008 --> 10:28.508
A nightmare. Oh, man.

10:30.401 --> 10:32.281
It’s just a dream, babe. It’s just a dream.

10:35.818 --> 10:37.248
Yeah. But a good one.

11:11.141 --> 11:14.590
(book says)“Movie Making for Morons”

11:15.905 --> 11:18.438
You take these cheerleaders to this really scary house, right?

11:18.438 --> 11:20.813
And these murderers are gonna be there and they’re just gonna kill them off one by one.

11:20.934 --> 11:23.835
The original idea was to break as many rules as possible,

11:24.239 --> 11:26.353
but still make a movie that people wanted to watch.

11:26.353 --> 11:30.538
It was kind of anarchic from the get go. We called out company Wing Films from winging it.

11:31.168 --> 11:33.773
We wanted to completely throw away the three-act structure.

11:34.005 --> 11:36.698
The whole idea of turning points, barriers pushing us into acts.

11:36.843 --> 11:40.736
- And because we were using our own money.
- Mostly our own money.

11:41.206 --> 11:44.228
And because we were shooting mostly with friends,

11:44.228 --> 11:50.216
we didn’t have to worry about a bunch of suits
dictating to us. It was very liberating.

11:55.790 --> 11:57.790
We could call it Virgin Cheerleaders in Chains.

12:03.363 --> 12:05.033
Can someone get that?

12:05.621 --> 12:08.018
Who’s coming? Are we expecting guests?

12:18.101 --> 12:18.601
Damn it. Excuse me.

12:20.771 --> 12:23.066
Woah! Just watch the bong, mon.

12:28.039 --> 12:30.460
- Hey, look who’s here.
- Hey, Nelson.

12:30.460 --> 12:32.433
Akasha. Brian.

12:32.534 --> 12:35.010
Oh, got the red wine.

12:35.145 --> 12:37.224
Hey, you guys!

12:37.883 --> 12:40.856
- I didn’t know they were coming.
- I thought you’d want them here.

12:45.049 --> 12:47.718
Brian. Akasha.

12:49.068 --> 12:52.630
It’s nice to see you guys. It’s been a while.
What’s been happening?

12:54.473 --> 12:57.575
Ah, making ends meet. I don’t know.
I got a commercial next week.

12:57.633 --> 13:01.174
- Doing effects for a student film.
- That’s really cool.

13:02.090 --> 13:05.648
I don’t know, man. What about you, right,
like, you’ve got to be writing something right now.

13:06.151 --> 13:09.016
Gotta wait until after dinner for the big surprise.

13:09.608 --> 13:12.768
Really!! Cool! I don’t know. Awesome.

13:22.138 --> 13:24.594
Hey, how you doing? You all right?

13:24.750 --> 13:26.353
Right on, mon.

13:26.586 --> 13:28.873
You want to smoke a bong?

13:30.515 --> 13:32.191
Why not? Yeah

13:33.238 --> 13:35.238
Just got to find a lighter, mon.

13:38.286 --> 13:41.721
- Hey, great meal, guys.
- Thank you.

13:44.248 --> 13:47.736
- So, what’s the big news?
- Hold on, mon.

13:48.918 --> 13:51.788
Let me prepare meself
for the revelation.

13:51.788 --> 13:53.864
- You sold Creature.
- No.

13:53.864 --> 13:54.601
What? What then?

13:55.593 --> 13:57.325
First the bad news...

13:57.788 --> 13:59.729
I’m not going to sell Creature.

14:00.174 --> 14:05.114
It’s a hundred mil project. It’s not a sequel,
a remake, or an adaptation.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.234
- Hollywood won’t even read it.
- But it'so good.

14:07.773 --> 14:09.534
Now for the good news.

14:10.821 --> 14:12.945
Chloe and I are writing a new screenplay.

14:13.554 --> 14:16.261
Virgin Cheerleaders in Chains.

14:16.579 --> 14:18.579
Boomshaka, mon.

14:18.896 --> 14:21.068
- The title alone will sell it.
- We’re not going to sell it.

14:21.393 --> 14:23.215
- We’re gonna make it.
- How?

14:23.423 --> 14:25.974
- With all your help.
- Hoo hoo. Hell yes.

14:27.071 --> 14:27.909
- All right. I’m in.

14:27.960 --> 14:31.738
So, ladies and gentlemen, please raise your glasses.

14:32.284 --> 14:36.559
To Virgin Cheerleaders in Chains.

14:36.683 --> 14:38.405
And to Hollywood…

14:39.066 --> 14:41.938
... Aw go fuck yourselves.

14:43.166 --> 14:44.648
First impressions?

14:45.913 --> 14:47.481
Well, I like it.

14:47.668 --> 14:50.580
Good pacing, and I really like that Chloe

14:50.580 --> 14:53.989
I do, too. Even more than I like Shane.

14:53.989 --> 14:56.456
But who’s the protagonist?

14:57.034 --> 15:00.743
You gotta have a clear protagonist
in the first fifteen minutes.

15:00.823 --> 15:03.083
I don’t think the audience is
asking that question. I don’t.

15:03.623 --> 15:04.315
I don’t.

15:04.395 --> 15:08.465
Hey. You get points for originality.
You know, your weird structure.

15:08.731 --> 15:12.771
It is that. Shane, if you’re gonna go all
Charlie Kaufman on us, don’t confuse us.

15:13.414 --> 15:16.799
Say yeah, man, I am already lost.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.093
Babe, this does not work for me.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.299
Why not?

15:23.781 --> 15:26.155
It adds an unnecessary level.

15:26.368 --> 15:28.094
The whole point was to go meta.

15:28.213 --> 15:31.656
Meta, yes. Meta meta, no.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.864
Besides it’s too self-indulgent.

15:33.864 --> 15:37.578
- That never stopped QT.
- We are not QT.

15:41.911 --> 15:42.909
Okay. Where are we going for dinner?

15:47.711 --> 15:49.580
What are we doing here?

15:49.631 --> 15:52.588
What do you think? We’re casting.

15:55.908 --> 15:57.346
Hey, Morris.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.763
Cousin Chloe. How’s it going, Shane?

15:59.763 --> 16:03.849
And it’s Mo now because
I got Mo of everything.

16:03.849 --> 16:05.501
Umm .. How’s Aunt Mildred?

16:05.501 --> 16:08.776
Oh, she’s doing great, still baking banana bread.
I’ll have to bring you some.

16:09.108 --> 16:11.581
How’s the .. uh…harem?

16:11.581 --> 16:15.138
You know. Same ol’ same ol’. They come. They go.

16:15.138 --> 16:18.650
Jessica last week. Tiffany the week before.
I mean poof.

16:18.650 --> 16:20.473
No call. No nothin’.

16:20.530 --> 16:22.830
By the way, I ran into Brian last week.

16:23.025 --> 16:26.539
Virgin Cheerleaders. It’s brilliant.

16:27.349 --> 16:30.368
Actually, that’s why we’re here.

16:30.833 --> 16:34.981
Do you have any strippers that have acting experience?

16:35.533 --> 16:38.765
You kidding me? Every pole dance
is a one-woman show.

16:39.533 --> 16:43.113
- You guys believe in serendipity?
- I guess. Why?

16:43.983 --> 16:46.013
Eyes on the stage.

17:16.531 --> 17:20.173
Rein your eyes in there, cowboy.

18:00.773 --> 18:04.824
So we go to a gentlemen’s club
to find our lead actress.

18:04.824 --> 18:08.231
- And she did not disappoint.
- No.

18:08.231 --> 18:11.691
So Amber is a theater major. I gotta go.
I’ll be back.

18:12.578 --> 18:18.193
So it’s a horror film. Would you be interested?

18:18.501 --> 18:20.290
Yeah. For sure.

18:20.549 --> 18:22.549
Awesome. Awesome.

18:30.808 --> 18:33.719
You’ve seen my tits. You’ve heard me scream.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.971
Do I get the part?

18:36.996 --> 18:40.099
She told us do I get the part.

18:40.099 --> 18:42.963
Just from one scream, and uh uh yeah.

18:43.683 --> 18:45.106
What did your dad say?

18:45.106 --> 18:48.354
He say he’ll match dollar for dollar for
whatever money we raise.

18:48.505 --> 18:52.321
But that fucker’s rich like The Donald, mon.

18:52.531 --> 18:56.793
I’m sorry, mon. I didn’t mean fucker.
I meant like he’s got the money.

18:57.108 --> 19:00.091
Yeah, yeah. But he wants commitment,
and the commitment – that equals money.

19:00.293 --> 19:01.601
Well, this is our guide.

19:01.601 --> 19:04.623
We need eight thousand to make something
that will get us into festivals.

19:04.623 --> 19:06.513
So how can we come up with the other four thousand?

19:07.390 --> 19:11.155
Ladies and gentlemen, watch this and be amazed.

19:12.401 --> 19:17.010
In the end they wwill need just one more thing.

19:17.263 --> 19:19.211
To survive!

19:39.498 --> 19:41.935
We’ll get it on YouTube and some crowdfunding sites.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.974
Don’t you need a script to
show investors, though?

19:45.974 --> 19:49.406
You would think, but the money
comes first, and then we write to our resources.

19:49.406 --> 19:51.566
Yeah, and investors don’t read scripts anyways.

19:51.566 --> 19:55.435
We’ll shoot some scenes as proof of concept, use that to raise the four, and then it’s festival time.

19:55.785 --> 19:57.859
Aren’t you getting a little ahead of yourself?

19:58.571 --> 20:00.226
Shane tends to do that.

20:00.226 --> 20:04.665
We were adamant that we were no
t making a slasher film, no torture porn.

20:04.729 --> 20:06.930
Mesmo se a gente quisesse,
e a gente não queria,

20:07.880 --> 20:10.111
Even if we wanted to, which we didn’t,
we could never compete with the Saw or Hostel franchises.

20:10.349 --> 20:13.566
So we made the decision early on to limit blood loss.

20:13.738 --> 20:21.231
That was the original plan. As anyone who’s seen the
movie knows, events sort of conspired to change that plan.

21:05.998 --> 21:06.498
Cut.

21:08.055 --> 21:10.000
Great job, everybody.

21:11.203 --> 21:14.328
Damn. Akasha did an amazing job. This looks just like me.

21:14.949 --> 21:18.371
- Yo, that could be you.
- Yeah, it could.

21:19.275 --> 21:21.208
Hey, do you think we could use
this knife for the next shot?

21:22.011 --> 21:24.410
It’s not a knife. It’s a machete.

21:24.998 --> 21:28.483
Hey, guys, let’s head out.
Akasha’s waiting for us at the pub.

21:28.483 --> 21:31.006
Okay, wait. Let’s break this all down first.

21:32.326 --> 21:34.471
I’ll swing by after I drop Amber off at work.

21:35.236 --> 21:35.736
OK.

21:35.946 --> 21:38.081
We’ll save a pint for you.

21:38.811 --> 21:39.311
But hurry.

21:40.336 --> 21:42.696
Hey, that scream was really good.

21:47.645 --> 21:49.270
Really. Holy crap. You know It’s really that scary.

21:51.691 --> 21:52.824
Thank you.

21:53.422 --> 21:55.422
I thought someone was dying earlier. I really did.
Clearly someone dies.

22:22.020 --> 22:22.520
Where were you?

22:24.241 --> 22:26.328
Amber asked for a ride after her shift.

22:30.785 --> 22:31.285
Should I be worried?

22:31.285 --> 22:32.343
No.

22:37.121 --> 22:38.398
No ..don’t … don’t worry.

23:14.213 --> 23:15.918
Hey, Mike. How’s it hangin’?

23:16.116 --> 23:17.655
Firme feito martelo.

23:17.856 --> 23:24.126
Like a hammer, son. And, no, I do not have the obscure
fucking Bulgarian horror classic that only you and a couple of your friends know about.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.806
I’m doing okay myself.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.050
But I’m not here to rent.

23:29.599 --> 23:33.298
Speaking of classics, Chloe and I watched M3 last week.

23:33.833 --> 23:34.333
Well, thank you..

23:35.979 --> 23:37.976
I’ll get a few pennies for that.

23:38.143 --> 23:39.755
So, what brings you in?

23:39.954 --> 23:42.641
- Chloe and I are writing a new script.
- That's cool

23:42.766 --> 23:45.814
We were wondering if you might like to help.
I kind of had you in mind for a part.

23:45.814 --> 23:47.413
What’s the part?

23:47.413 --> 23:50.824
Well, you’d play yourself. Mike Beale.
You’d even have a shop just like this.

23:51.675 --> 23:52.901
A horror movie?

23:53.063 --> 23:54.319
Is there another kind?

23:54.671 --> 23:55.726
What’s your budget?

23:57.066 --> 23:58.219
Eight thousand.

23:58.219 --> 23:59.140
For a feature.

23:59.363 --> 24:02.301
Eighty-five pages. Ninety minutes with the end credits.

24:02.301 --> 24:04.935
- That ain’t low. That’s no.

24:05.255 --> 24:07.483
- Gotta be deferred payments.
- That or a percentage?

24:10.035 --> 24:11.868
So you need me for distribution.

24:12.841 --> 24:14.239
Can’t deny it.

24:14.755 --> 24:17.343
But look, the story needs you. In fact,
it can’t work without you.

24:18.219 --> 24:19.819
- Don’t bullshit me , Shane.

24:20.213 --> 24:23.331
I’m not. Serious as a corpse.

24:27.301 --> 24:28.165
- All right.

24:29.871 --> 24:31.074
I’ll look at it.

24:34.469 --> 24:36.216
This ain’t eighty-five pages.

24:37.171 --> 24:40.180
It’s.. uh… work in progress?

24:45.603 --> 24:46.444
Okay, Dad.

24:47.078 --> 24:48.388
I understand. I’ll call you.

24:49.186 --> 24:49.686
Bye

24:51.596 --> 24:53.208
Okay. So I got this great idea.

24:54.551 --> 24:56.576
What happened? Who died?

24:56.876 --> 24:58.813
- My dad is backing out.
- Why?

24:59.043 --> 25:01.435
- He can’t commit without a script.
= Then we’ll give him one.

25:02.148 --> 25:04.531
Shane, do you know where
this thing is going? Because I sure don’t.

25:04.890 --> 25:06.356
I know we have a third act.

25:07.458 --> 25:07.958
Umm… sort of.

25:09.155 --> 25:10.515
And I just found the person we need for it.

25:10.946 --> 25:14.459
Mike Beale. The Man. The Legend.

25:14.721 --> 25:15.731
Machete Mike?

25:15.994 --> 25:18.564
I believe you just busted our non-existent budget.

25:18.681 --> 25:22.831
He’s in for a percentage. Plus, here’s the kicker.
He’s got our third act location for us.

25:34.641 --> 25:36.323
Hey, are you sure you know where we’re going?

25:36.591 --> 25:38.071
I’m just following Mike’s directions.

25:38.344 --> 25:40.290
Yeah, well we haven’t seen a house in miles.

25:40.290 --> 25:42.510
I grew up in country like this. Loved it.

25:44.954 --> 25:46.766
- Surely you jest.
- I’m not.

25:47.064 --> 25:48.061
It's beautiful.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.814
Fresh air. Quiet.

25:51.646 --> 25:53.525
And don’t call me Shirley.

25:53.964 --> 25:55.326
What did you do for fun?

25:55.551 --> 25:58.505
Took long walks. Played with my dog. Swam in the pond.

26:00.076 --> 26:01.349
And read like crazy.

26:03.571 --> 26:05.280
- Really?
- What?

26:05.471 --> 26:08.609
You don’t think strippers can read.
That is so sexist, Nelson.

26:09.625 --> 26:13.971
Technically it’s only sexist if
I only thought male strippers could read.

26:14.576 --> 26:16.338
I used to read, mon.

26:16.828 --> 26:19.175
That’s it. I think we’re lost. I’m calling Mike.

26:20.946 --> 26:24.760
- Shit. Still no cell reception.
- Mike said it might be spotty.

26:25.221 --> 26:29.286
Okay. I give up. Let’s just go home.
We definitely need a location manager.

26:39.969 --> 26:41.681
I've got something.

26:45.050 --> 26:46.858
- How’s it going?
- It' going.

26:47.836 --> 26:51.250
It’s cool, mon. It’s like Arts and Crafts class.

26:57.574 --> 26:58.074
What do you think?

27:03.401 --> 27:05.611
What is it?

27:06.763 --> 27:08.026
Our poster.

27:09.081 --> 27:10.719
Getting ahead of yourself again.

27:11.798 --> 27:15.721
My father would always say,
“You’re putting the cart before the horse.”

27:16.336 --> 27:19.401
Horses. Carts. Nelson, you need to
drag your butt into the 21st Century.

27:19.473 --> 27:21.691
- It means …..
- I know what it means.

27:22.714 --> 27:25.223
No, mon. I think Nelson’s right.

27:27.283 --> 27:29.803
You got to put the horse before the cart.

27:32.398 --> 27:34.435
How’s our fundraising coming along?

27:34.771 --> 27:36.251
We raised seventeen hundred.

27:36.443 --> 27:38.463
Yes. Twenty-three hundred more and we are a go.

27:38.611 --> 27:40.488
Twenty three hundred and a script.

27:40.744 --> 27:42.204
Remember what Nelson’s dad said.

27:42.983 --> 27:44.239
I’m thinking.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.563
I’m thinking what if we did a fundraiser.

27:46.910 --> 27:49.031
Chloe, your boss, Angela, she’s in a band, right?

27:49.696 --> 27:51.255
- Yeah.
- Think she’s do a benefit for us?

27:51.711 --> 27:52.625
I can ask.

27:53.446 --> 27:55.701
And, Nelson, if we can set it up, get your dad to come.

27:57.211 --> 27:58.986
Yeah. I guess.

28:10.479 --> 28:11.729
Hey, Mr. Businessman. How’s it going?

28:11.968 --> 28:18.108
Damn good. Check this out. We sold eighty tickets online. Not too many people showed up. But we did get a lot of money – thank you, Sir –

28:18.290 --> 28:20.486
1620.

28:23.275 --> 28:27.956
- Minus the expenses for the club.
- Enough with the expenses, Man. Let me enjoy sixteen hundred..

28:29.013 --> 28:31.128
- Is your dad here?
- Yeah. He’s in the restaurant.

28:34.790 --> 28:41.041
Oh oh, just so you know, Billy walked in there earlier.
I do not want him near my dad. He’s pretty …. fucked up. So….

28:41.829 --> 28:42.795
…. just be careful.

29:02.018 --> 29:06.188
We’ve got our actors, we’ve got our locations set, so we pretty much have our movie.

29:06.586 --> 29:09.853
We can make it, and we can sell it. With your help, of course.

29:10.395 --> 29:17.494
I like your plan. But you have to write it before you make it. And until I see
a script, all I can give you is my best wishes.

29:18.635 --> 29:19.135
A what?

29:20.099 --> 29:21.405
A SCRIPT.

29:21.878 --> 29:22.378
Okay.

29:37.543 --> 29:38.811
Thank you so much.

29:39.728 --> 29:41.496
We are called SupeRette.

29:41.805 --> 29:44.416
This next song is called Karma.

30:03.048 --> 30:05.938
Yes! Yes! My gosh. Fantastic set, Angela.

30:06.104 --> 30:07.753
- Thank you so much.
- You guys are awesome.

30:07.908 --> 30:09.991
I mean play it loud. Yeah!

30:10.221 --> 30:11.564
We like to do that. That’s for sure.

30:12.228 --> 30:13.658
I’ll see you guys on set, okay?

30:15.020 --> 30:16.278
You guys are awesome.

30:17.148 --> 30:18.421
I don’t know how we’re ever going to repay you.

30:19.405 --> 30:20.453
Did you not tell him?

30:21.104 --> 30:23.175
Angela wants to be on the crew.

30:25.253 --> 30:26.824
Sweet! What do you want to do?

30:27.094 --> 30:32.795
Well, I’ve done location scouting before, so I thought maybe I could go to the property early and handle the catering or sleeping quarters.

30:33.438 --> 30:35.369
That would be totally awesome.

30:35.910 --> 30:37.526
- There’s one catch though.
- What?

30:37.526 --> 30:39.016
I’d like my band to be in the movie.

30:39.546 --> 30:41.778
Of course.

30:43.083 --> 30:45.853
- Yeah, I don’t do that.
- She doesn’t do that, babe.

31:16.801 --> 31:18.251
Nelson, what are you doing with those people?

31:18.398 --> 31:19.521
Is Billy all there?

31:19.723 --> 31:22.596
He’s not stupid. He’s okay when he’s …..

31:22.714 --> 31:24.331
When he’s not smoking.

31:25.420 --> 31:26.653
Come on. The man reeked of pot.

31:27.073 --> 31:30.645
And Shane and Chloe. What? Guy works in a taco shack, and what does she do?

31:31.285 --> 31:33.668
Oh, yeah, sells popcorn at the multi-plex.

31:33.953 --> 31:36.324
Cut them some slack. They were English majors.

31:36.476 --> 31:38.551
You’re a semester away from an MBA.

31:38.551 --> 31:40.013
And I’m going to finish it.

31:40.368 --> 31:40.868
I just think…

31:41.078 --> 31:42.903
I just think they’re on to something.

31:43.168 --> 31:44.886
And I want to be part of it.

31:45.074 --> 31:47.008
Your name in lights. That’s what it’s all about, right?

31:49.198 --> 31:53.671
- Don’t let it blind you, son.
- Dad, I won’t. I… I promise.

31:53.755 --> 31:55.339
Focus on the finish line.

31:55.868 --> 31:56.368
I will.

31:58.094 --> 31:59.234
But will you still help us?

31:59.706 --> 32:01.064
Not without a script.

32:02.031 --> 32:03.405
And a good one at that.

32:06.425 --> 32:06.925
Sugar?

32:07.728 --> 32:09.150
You know I don’t take sugar.

32:11.981 --> 32:13.441
4200 dollars.

32:16.428 --> 32:18.564
- What did your dad say?
- He said he wants to see a script.

32:19.393 --> 32:21.788
Come on, man. You said yourself
let’s give him one

32:25.128 --> 32:28.186
- Yeah, well, we would if we could.
- I’ve never had writer’s block this bad.

32:28.983 --> 32:30.689
Let’s just throw some shit down.
Maybe he won’t even read it.

32:31.183 --> 32:34.356
Oh, no, he’ll read it all right.
He has a highly trained shit detector.

32:35.051 --> 32:36.753
Well, how far into the script are you?

32:37.383 --> 32:38.766
We’re almost at the midpoint.

32:40.391 --> 32:42.525
- You said we had a third act.

32:44.170 --> 32:46.011
Depends on how you define “have.”

32:47.396 --> 32:50.388
I’m afraid we’re going to have to do something I never wanted to do.

33:15.214 --> 33:16.854
There’s more in the fridge, man.

33:20.058 --> 33:22.625
Damn. Please get rid of this shit.

33:26.298 --> 33:28.126
Hey, man, somebody call about a refrigerator?

33:28.316 --> 33:29.748
Anybody call for maintenance?

33:30.010 --> 33:32.646
Yeah, mon, so glad you could make it.

33:33.275 --> 33:33.775
I’m Billy.

33:34.898 --> 33:36.119
I’m Tom. Tom Kendall.

33:36.339 --> 33:37.693
This is my friend Nelson.

33:38.780 --> 33:39.280
wow.

33:40.133 --> 33:41.604
Don' mind me.

33:42.206 --> 33:44.301
Refrigerator is the kitchen. Nelson will show you the way, mon.

33:45.098 --> 33:46.551
What’s wrong with the refrigerator?

33:47.165 --> 33:49.168
Chloe, sweet sistah,

33:49.521 --> 33:51.248
please tell me you noticed the ice cream.

33:51.248 --> 33:52.375
What’s wrong with the ice cream?

33:52.751 --> 33:55.005
What’s wrong with the ice cream?
What’s wrong with you, mon?

33:55.801 --> 33:57.168
The ice cream is way too soft.

33:57.893 --> 34:01.516
Obviously the machine is not
operating at its full capacity.

34:01.938 --> 34:04.655
You know I don’t know what the hell Billy is
talking about. Something wrong with the ice box.

34:07.013 --> 34:09.679
Well, let’s have a look here, and see what we can find.

34:11.283 --> 34:14.489
Phone’s ringing. Shane, can you handle that for me? Thanks.

34:16.388 --> 34:16.888
Hello.

34:18.791 --> 34:21.495
Yes, sir, this is a real common problem this time of the year.

34:22.263 --> 34:24.560
Little old filter here –

34:25.054 --> 34:27.735
it’ll stop up and shut the whole freezer down.

34:29.199 --> 34:32.585
Just about every six months or so, take it out of here, clean it up,

34:33.913 --> 34:35.467
pop it back in place,

34:36.915 --> 34:38.466
Bob’s your uncle.

34:40.070 --> 34:40.840
What do we owe you?

34:40.989 --> 34:41.895
Nada.

34:42.473 --> 34:44.786
I’ll send the bill to Westgate Management.

34:46.466 --> 34:48.466
Say, are you guys filmmakers or what?

34:49.896 --> 34:51.614
We are in pre production

34:52.123 --> 34:53.946
Hell, man, I’m an actor.

34:54.686 --> 34:55.186
really?

34:55.870 --> 34:56.797
Yeah. Tell me about your film.

34:57.083 --> 34:57.584
Of course.

35:05.981 --> 35:07.128
Umm. Listen, I tell ya, man,

35:08.106 --> 35:10.988
I’d really really like to be part of this now.

35:12.873 --> 35:15.766
Hell I don’t mind deferred pay at all.
I’m a hell of an actor.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.879
Give me that show reel.
We don’t have our bad guy yet.

35:19.973 --> 35:23.638
I tell you what. You need somebody to chain up virgin cheerleaders,

35:26.693 --> 35:28.040
I’m your man, buddy.

35:29.863 --> 35:33.306
Oh, God, time flies when I’m drinkin’ beer.

35:34.360 --> 35:34.860
I gotta book.

35:36.073 --> 35:37.366
I’ll get you that reel though

35:42.053 --> 35:44.114
Is that Tom the refrigerator guy?

35:46.026 --> 35:47.826
- He is good.
- And cheap, too.

35:48.843 --> 35:50.211
I’m gonna meet with him tomorrow.

36:04.594 --> 36:05.728
I miss this.

36:06.686 --> 36:07.186
Me, too.

36:09.290 --> 36:10.993
- I heard a cool line today.
- Yeah?

36:12.748 --> 36:14.629
Yeah, someone, some guy used it on Amber at the club.

36:15.534 --> 36:17.995
He said, “How about some honey for some money?”

36:20.526 --> 36:21.911
Wow.

36:22.629 --> 36:24.373
You really know how to kill a moment.

36:24.461 --> 36:24.961
What?

36:25.610 --> 36:27.153
Hon, if you don’t know.

36:27.945 --> 36:30.746
I just thought it was a cool line. We could have a scene where she’s leaving the club …

36:31.033 --> 36:32.973
What is it with you two?

36:33.071 --> 36:33.848
What do you mean?

36:34.006 --> 36:36.641
I mean that you’re spending more
time with her than with me.

36:36.766 --> 36:37.918
Her car’s in the shop.

36:38.093 --> 36:39.746
Besides she’s got some good story ideas.

36:39.868 --> 36:42.843
Oh, yeah, does she keep them right here
because that’s all I ever see you looking at.

36:42.995 --> 36:45.233
Come on, you know I like small boobs.

36:49.215 --> 36:50.433
Wow! You did not just say that.

36:50.501 --> 36:56.199
No, I didn’t. I..I..I mean I did, but I…I didn’t mean,
you know what I mean.

37:01.806 --> 37:03.291
I’m gonna go downstairs.

37:22.183 --> 37:26.133
Vou encontrar com a Angela, ela vai na
locação, vou mostrar as instruções para ela.

37:26.278 --> 37:27.923
I’m meeting with Angela to give her directions.

37:28.628 --> 37:30.086
Can we talk?

37:33.084 --> 37:34.608
I love you.

37:47.298 --> 37:48.811
You sure you don’t want any?

37:50.916 --> 37:53.643
No no no no. Don’t let me have any, please.

38:00.083 --> 38:01.300
I hate that this is happening.

38:01.373 --> 38:02.536
You don’t know that this is happening.

38:02.536 --> 38:03.906
I think I know that this is happening.

38:04.129 --> 38:05.403
Well, did you ask him?

38:05.693 --> 38:09.188
Yes. He said that I had nothing to worry about.

38:09.511 --> 38:11.531
Then you probably have nothing to worry about.

38:12.135 --> 38:14.146
Why do I have these bad feelings?

38:15.446 --> 38:18.521
Look, even if he, if he’s attracted to her,

38:19.159 --> 38:20.576
it’s not going to last.

38:21.303 --> 38:22.280
How do you know?

38:25.448 --> 38:27.671
My husband looks at women all the time.

38:28.135 --> 38:30.391
Most men look at women all the time.

38:31.006 --> 38:33.155
It’s in their genes. They can’t help it.

38:33.929 --> 38:36.264
Doesn’t mean he’s going to do anything about it.

38:36.429 --> 38:37.949
A lot of men do.

38:38.526 --> 38:41.093
Well, a lot of men are dirty, filthy pigs.

38:46.104 --> 38:48.228
Shane, Shane loves you.

38:50.506 --> 38:51.296
He really does.

38:52.419 --> 38:53.816
Thank you, Angela.

38:54.456 --> 38:55.205
For what?

38:55.915 --> 38:56.415
For…

38:57.108 --> 38:58.169
…listening.

38:58.679 --> 38:59.826
Coma o sorvete.

39:02.110 --> 39:03.578
Eat your ice cream.

39:03.695 --> 39:04.891
Hey, how’s the house?

39:05.070 --> 39:08.768
Yeah, so, we tried to find the place. We even had directions, but we still couldn’t find the house.

39:09.060 --> 39:10.446
You couldn’t find the house?

39:11.064 --> 39:12.351
Well, that’s why you need me.

39:12.659 --> 39:15.314
It’s right out there by the 420 and 22.

39:15.481 --> 39:16.643
There’s a Y.

39:17.064 --> 39:19.266
There’s a huge cow with polka-dots on it.

39:20.705 --> 39:21.669
And no clue.

39:22.811 --> 39:25.919
Listen, this is why you hired me.

39:26.141 --> 39:29.745
I’m your location scout. I’ll go up there right now.
And I’ll call you when I get there.

39:31.781 --> 39:33.118
Done!

39:33.405 --> 39:34.649
We were lucky.

39:35.416 --> 39:37.673
Not everyone was.

39:38.341 --> 39:40.846
No question it was …. a killer shoot.

41:03.514 --> 41:04.828
Hello.

41:05.581 --> 41:06.983
Hello,

41:11.703 --> 41:12.756
Hello,

41:13.591 --> 41:15.330
Mr. Fish?

42:11.148 --> 42:13.735
Wicked array, mon.

42:13.875 --> 42:15.298
We’re using all of this?

42:15.418 --> 42:17.254
We’re not sure. We’re still writing.

42:19.528 --> 42:21.284
Oh, yeah. Hey, we can use mine. Boomshaka!

42:23.888 --> 42:25.231
I think we have all that we need.

42:26.928 --> 42:28.510
- Yeah, well, we’re definitely going to use this.
- Why?

42:32.831 --> 42:34.233
What the fuck, Dude?

42:51.873 --> 42:54.326
Cool, mon. You got me.

42:54.699 --> 42:56.378
Let me see this thing.

42:56.979 --> 42:58.233
Fuck you.

42:58.761 --> 43:01.413
- What do you want to say to your friends?

43:02.351 --> 43:05.560
Don’t. Don’t. Please don’t.

43:07.465 --> 43:08.588
Don't.

43:09.331 --> 43:10.743
Fuck you. Fuck you.

43:15.056 --> 43:16.791
I still can’t get ahold of Angela.

43:17.169 --> 43:19.098
We know the service is crappy there.

43:19.278 --> 43:21.926
Yeah, but she sent this weird text.
It just said, “Don’t.”

43:22.389 --> 43:23.871
It can mean almost anything.

43:25.256 --> 43:26.478
Are we still going up there.

43:26.641 --> 43:29.165
Yeah. We’re all meeting here at three.

43:29.520 --> 43:30.659
Then we’re a GO.

43:31.283 --> 43:35.011
My indie guidebook says if there’s a problem in production,

43:35.011 --> 43:38.086
work around it. Make it the character’s problem.

43:38.338 --> 43:40.274
Fuck you.

44:02.043 --> 44:03.301
- Are we rolling?

44:47.238 --> 44:48.304
Is it okay to talk about that?

44:55.030 --> 44:55.953
I’m not sure … uh…

44:56.326 --> 44:57.803
I think we’re gonna have to stop here.

45:14.090 --> 45:15.608
All right, guys. We’re losing light.

45:23.594 --> 45:25.778
- All right. We’re locked and loaded.

45:26.343 --> 45:28.806
Okay, everybody, let’s go wrap this movie.

45:29.391 --> 45:30.824
Oh, Captain! My Captain!

46:11.001 --> 46:12.961
Really creepy place.

46:21.010 --> 46:22.169
I'm Ginger.

46:22.403 --> 46:23.883
I'm a big fan.

46:24.270 --> 46:27.308
Thank you. You know I started in
the drama department you’re in.

46:27.361 --> 46:29.403
I know. I follow your career.

46:29.508 --> 46:32.568
You know it’s funny. I always joke with my friend Julie who’s here that if

46:32.666 --> 46:36.928
I were ever in any kidnapping situation, I would get Stockholm syndrome with you.

46:37.998 --> 46:39.131
Get it up, Billy!

46:47.554 --> 46:49.006
Hey, you dropped your knife.

46:50.718 --> 46:52.563
It’s not a knife. It’s a machete.

46:53.495 --> 46:56.918
Okay, everybody. Let’s get inside. We need to organize. We’re filming later.

47:09.831 --> 47:11.143
Is angela here?

47:11.215 --> 47:12.834
- I was going to ask you. She never showed.

47:13.263 --> 47:15.756
I’m sure she’s all right. Probably got hung up somewhere.

48:22.726 --> 48:24.678
I’m sorry. I just couldn’t help myself.

48:24.938 --> 48:25.524
You got us.

48:25.761 --> 48:28.344
Why you all wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for this movie.

48:29.553 --> 48:31.558
Made Mike here famous.

48:35.381 --> 48:37.784
Mike, say grace.

48:43.504 --> 48:45.326
Our father,

48:46.343 --> 48:49.814
bless this food which we receive from your
bounty with humility and gratitude.

48:52.428 --> 48:54.895
And bless our friends from the big city.

48:57.560 --> 49:00.731
Help us to show them the time of their lives. Amen.

49:02.485 --> 49:03.458
Amen.

49:04.986 --> 49:06.155
Amen

49:11.798 --> 49:13.276
One mre thing.

49:13.913 --> 49:19.521
No humans were harmed in
the making of this sausage.

49:29.419 --> 49:31.040
Namaste, ya’ll

49:40.158 --> 49:44.270
Save room for dessert. We’re having
fresh rhubarb pie.

49:49.953 --> 49:51.629
…. Get away, Tom.

49:51.751 --> 49:52.251
What?

49:52.316 --> 49:54.111
Not you. The dog.

49:55.613 --> 49:57.786
They are beautiful, Mr. Fish.

49:58.398 --> 50:01.643
Thank you, but I don't know how they got out.

50:02.006 --> 50:04.360
Otto, come get these dogs.

50:05.311 --> 50:08.953
I'm sorry, Mr. Fish. Tom, Harry, Venham.

50:09.541 --> 50:12.078
They look well behaved. Do you train them?

50:12.375 --> 50:13.735
To do what

50:16.764 --> 50:19.113
Hello, you know, did they remind you

50:19.330 --> 50:21.344
Let me answer that

50:22.364 --> 50:24.824
You just saw Tom and Harry

50:25.735 --> 50:28.998
They have a problem. Dick.
um until Couple of months ago.

50:30.655 --> 50:34.751
I was shaving with my own striped razor as usual

50:35.873 --> 50:38.486
Damned if I didn't going cut myself

50:39.310 --> 50:41.750
I looked at Dick

50:42.083 --> 50:44.908
He snarled at me preparing to leap

50:44.989 --> 50:46.844
"Stay, Dick, stay"

50:48.770 --> 50:52.343
He jumped at me and I had to gut
him with my own raisin

50:56.435 --> 50:56.935
So.

50:58.013 --> 51:00.340
To answer your question

51:01.165 --> 51:06.004
Yes, they will remind me, as long
as they don't smell any blood

51:09.179 --> 51:10.514
You at dog person?

51:12.103 --> 51:14.709
Yes. I love dogs.
And they love me

51:15.625 --> 51:16.878
Like a bitch in heat

51:17.146 --> 51:18.139
I'm sorry?

51:18.368 --> 51:19.959
I said I pinched my hip.

51:20.271 --> 51:23.076
You wouldn't pinch your hip
if you got out of the chair more often

51:23.443 --> 51:25.491
So, you can walk?

51:25.606 --> 51:26.748
Oh yeah, he can walk.

51:26.863 --> 51:30.245
I can get around a little .
Maybe to the door and back

51:30.870 --> 51:33.948
Dr. say I have some kind of nerve condition

51:34.145 --> 51:36.298
- You got lazi-itis is what you got.

51:36.548 --> 51:39.143
You’re a harsh taskmaster, Mike.

51:39.698 --> 51:42.353
Speaking of tasks, who’s on kitchen duty?

51:48.198 --> 51:49.571
I'm so full

51:56.264 --> 51:57.705
Where is Angela?

52:03.553 --> 52:04.968
Don't!

52:12.544 --> 52:14.081
Simmering pigs' feet

52:14.313 --> 52:15.831
Not ready to pickle yet

52:18.104 --> 52:19.868
I thought it smelled familiar

52:27.153 --> 52:29.103
Young people. This old man is going to bed

52:29.103 --> 52:30.875
Thank you for dinner, Mr. Fish. .

52:31.688 --> 52:34.544
Thank Mike. Hit into cocaine.

52:37.018 --> 52:38.923
Don't forget to turn on the fence

52:40.083 --> 52:44.118
Don't know what good it does. Fence in the back got a whole you could drive a tractor through

52:45.155 --> 52:46.948
Turn on the fence?

52:48.286 --> 52:50.221
We had to electrify it

52:50.651 --> 52:52.943
Keeps that drunken teens from town out.

52:53.729 --> 52:54.946
And other critters.

52:56.118 --> 52:58.334
Hey, what's that shed out therefore

53:00.133 --> 53:02.375
That's uncle Al's inner sanctum

53:02.851 --> 53:04.699
Where the keeps his

53:05.373 --> 53:06.128
… Collection.

53:07.238 --> 53:08.576
What does he collect?

53:09.021 --> 53:09.616
Stuff.

53:10.100 --> 53:11.461
I'll say.

53:11.518 --> 53:13.646
Where is everybody anyway?

53:13.833 --> 53:15.063
Setting up for those scenes.

53:15.215 --> 53:16.388
One more thing.

53:16.568 --> 53:17.731
After the shoot,

53:18.205 --> 53:19.818
Don't go wandering around.

53:20.508 --> 53:22.201
Easy to get lost

53:23.216 --> 53:25.273
78 Alpha, take 01.

53:29.473 --> 53:30.816
Attention. Everybody.

53:32.306 --> 53:34.929
This is how our all-is-lost moment

53:35.688 --> 53:38.475
Ginger and Julie, you are dead.

53:38.818 --> 53:40.236
Oh, got it

53:40.396 --> 53:42.668
You were great dead at the rehearsal.

53:43.023 --> 53:44.373
Thank you.

53:45.044 --> 53:46.705
I'm in the middle. Obviously

53:47.398 --> 53:51.245
I still have some fight left in me.I know that
Tom is going to come through that door any moment

53:51.469 --> 53:52.786
Jeez, Mike.

53:52.911 --> 53:53.985
Alright

53:54.411 --> 53:55.840
Mike, thank you.

53:56.094 --> 53:57.925
Julie, raise your arms on towards the light.

54:01.798 --> 54:03.291
Alright, guys, we're set

54:14.191 --> 54:15.373
And...

54:16.613 --> 54:17.113
Action!

54:26.580 --> 54:27.080
Cut!

54:39.363 --> 54:40.165
How was that?

54:40.736 --> 54:43.125
- Ok. just to be safe do another one.
- Ok? That was fantastic!

54:43.235 --> 54:44.094
Just to be safe.

54:44.168 --> 54:47.409
We're going to do a reverse and
then break for tonight.

54:50.064 --> 54:53.121
We can let them rest, and then
we'll talk later in the library

54:53.178 --> 54:53.810
Yeah.

54:55.691 --> 54:57.110
You guys want to see the playback?

55:13.155 --> 55:15.988
This is a nice place for creepy house.

55:16.046 --> 55:17.558
Yeah, I like it. It's a nice bed too.

55:17.725 --> 55:19.391
- really nice bed
- really nice bed

55:19.931 --> 55:22.451
- went to try out the bed?
- I do want to try out the bed

55:23.783 --> 55:27.614
Unfortunately, I need to go downstairs.
Shane needs me right now

55:29.253 --> 55:30.294
Does Shane need me?

55:32.038 --> 55:34.729
I need you. No, Shane doesn't need you now.

55:34.881 --> 55:37.218
Later. It's easy stuff like cuts and bruises.

55:37.218 --> 55:38.561
A snap for you.

55:39.706 --> 55:41.110
You're so full of yourself

55:45.621 --> 55:47.523
So I'll see you down in a little bit

55:47.591 --> 55:50.580
Yeah. I'm just going to take a shower
And maybe walk around a bit

55:52.459 --> 55:53.093
Okay. Watchout.

55:56.574 --> 55:57.074
Bye.

55:58.844 --> 56:01.143
You realize we have no backstory for this house?

56:01.976 --> 56:02.476
So?

56:03.476 --> 56:04.179
How about this?

56:05.628 --> 56:08.951
This is a phone for unwed mothers, ok?

56:11.510 --> 56:15.489
‘cause back then getting knocked up out of wedlock
was like, you know, a badge of shame and shit

56:16.521 --> 56:18.383
So, parents sent their daughters here

56:18.618 --> 56:19.973
To raise kids

56:21.701 --> 56:24.548
And then like, you know, while there are where
away they just tell the neighbors they're in Europe or something

56:26.038 --> 56:27.381
What happened to the kids?

56:28.600 --> 56:29.514
I don't know. They grew up..

56:29.804 --> 56:31.718
It doesn't matter. It's a one line fix.

56:32.145 --> 56:33.648
I hate exposition.

56:34.071 --> 56:38.235
You think these dolls are haunted by the
ghosts of the kids who died here

56:38.625 --> 56:42.334
Absolutely. This room is so freaking creepy.
It was right here

56:42.485 --> 56:47.781
Actually, I saw and what those ghost shows
dolls are vessels for human spirits

56:50.629 --> 56:52.793
You have been watching way too much TV

56:52.883 --> 56:54.524
- really?
- that's true.

56:54.906 --> 56:58.711
Seriously though, if I had known we were going to
be sleeping in the children of the corn bedroom,

56:58.826 --> 57:00.196
I would have brought more Xanax.

57:00.590 --> 57:02.250
This is so cool.

57:02.653 --> 57:04.118
If by cool, you mean creepy

57:04.296 --> 57:07.256
No. And actual movie. The real thing.

57:07.406 --> 57:08.479
I feature.

57:08.721 --> 57:10.148
And with Mike Beale.

57:12.155 --> 57:13.731
Hey, why can't we see a script?

57:17.001 --> 57:18.001
What script?

57:18.458 --> 57:21.706
Just be glad you ladies to those improv classes.

57:23.133 --> 57:23.875
Okay?

57:27.125 --> 57:28.915
Did you not take those improv classes?

57:29.215 --> 57:31.731
I took three hours. It was amazing.
I was amazing.

57:32.013 --> 57:35.023
The professor got me high.
What's hi going to say no?

57:38.096 --> 57:41.415
I'm going to take care something.
You guys have fun.

57:42.094 --> 57:43.751
Be right back.

57:46.145 --> 57:48.316
Wait. What are you guys going
to do while I'm gone?

57:49.798 --> 57:52.290
- We'll think of something.
- Definitely.

57:54.570 --> 57:56.393
I'm sure you will.

57:56.800 --> 57:57.791
Be good.

57:57.919 --> 57:59.553
We will.

58:04.354 --> 58:05.938
- I want that Maine Machete Massacre mask

58:05.938 --> 58:08.020
- You think Billy and Nelson will help us?
- Sure they will.

58:15.701 --> 58:16.201
Come in.

58:26.121 --> 58:29.925
Shane isn't here. He and Brian are going
over the scenes for tomorrow.

58:32.221 --> 58:34.728
I'm not looking for Shane.

58:40.163 --> 58:41.398
Can I come in?

58:43.028 --> 58:43.528
Sure.

58:55.625 --> 58:57.326
What are you doing?

58:58.428 --> 58:59.830
Just reworking some dialogue.

59:02.209 --> 59:05.616
Yeah. Because there are screams
and then there are screams

59:05.873 --> 59:07.415
What is it you want to talk about?

59:09.436 --> 59:11.943
I want to clear up any misunderstandings.

59:13.391 --> 59:14.188
Like what?

59:15.071 --> 59:16.965
Like that I'm interested in Shane.

59:17.955 --> 59:20.146
Well, maybe you should tell him that.

59:21.645 --> 59:24.156
Hi will. But I wanted to tell you.

59:51.131 --> 59:54.296
Remember how I told you I was raised
in countries like this?

59:55.936 --> 59:58.458
My grand parents raised me. I was homeschooled.

59:59.798 --> 01:00:04.228
And the only other kids my age where these
two sisters that lived on a farm nearby.

01:00:06.396 --> 01:00:09.956
And at night and we would sneak out
and go skinny-dipping

01:00:11.606 --> 01:00:12.965
And...

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:16.808
We would have a lot of fun.

01:00:19.431 --> 01:00:21.399
If you know what I mean.

01:00:24.801 --> 01:00:27.318
- I'm making you uncomfortable.
- no.

01:00:27.546 --> 01:00:31.593
No, you are not making me uncomfortable.

01:00:38.653 --> 01:00:43.351
Chloe, I never developed any interesting boys.

01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:54.981
Sorry.

01:00:59.949 --> 01:01:02.968
Man, you could have fooled Shane.

01:01:03.506 --> 01:01:04.326
Holy cow.

01:01:07.031 --> 01:01:10.475
When he first saw you at the strip club,
he was like...BOING!

01:01:17.536 --> 01:01:20.784
I kind of get that a lot from men.

01:01:21.096 --> 01:01:22.725
Hazards of the job.

01:01:24.379 --> 01:01:25.506
Women too though.

01:01:30.811 --> 01:01:34.034
- I am making you uncomfortable.
- No. No.

01:01:36.844 --> 01:01:39.336
You are not making me uncomfortable.

01:01:42.853 --> 01:01:45.011
You have read Henry James, right?

01:01:45.341 --> 01:01:47.703
Yeah. Sure. Turn of the screw.

01:01:50.028 --> 01:01:55.078
You know how he says:
“be one for whom nothing is lost. “

01:01:55.705 --> 01:01:58.826
Shane loves you so much.

01:02:00.764 --> 01:02:02.721
Surely you know that.

01:02:06.020 --> 01:02:06.546
I know.

01:02:08.326 --> 01:02:09.513
And don't call me Shirley.

01:02:11.583 --> 01:02:13.378
That's my line.

01:02:19.364 --> 01:02:22.006
Guys, we shouldn't be in here.

01:02:22.719 --> 01:02:26.254
- What are you afraid of, Nelson?
- I'm not afraid of anything. I'm just saying.

01:02:26.613 --> 01:02:30.495
Nelson is a good little Boy Scouts.
Always staying on the straight and narrow.

01:02:32.871 --> 01:02:35.705
You should open up a bit.

01:02:36.123 --> 01:02:37.419
You got any smoke?

01:02:37.771 --> 01:02:40.713
Now. I swore off to herb
until the end of the wrap party.

01:02:41.813 --> 01:02:45.081
Right, Brah?…

01:02:45.346 --> 01:02:46.786
Hell no!

01:02:47.603 --> 01:02:49.054
It was worth the try.

01:02:49.235 --> 01:02:51.161
Come on. Let's check out the area.

01:02:52.648 --> 01:02:54.790
Check out this oven.

01:02:55.489 --> 01:02:58.321
Oh man, you could bake so many goodies in here.

01:03:01.046 --> 01:03:02.580
What was that noise?

01:03:03.953 --> 01:03:05.304
Is this still on?

01:03:05.455 --> 01:03:07.278
Why does Mr. Fish needs something this big?

01:03:07.455 --> 01:03:09.451
I don't know. Let's find out.

01:03:09.781 --> 01:03:10.721
It's locked.

01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:13.121
Well, I learned a few things in prison

01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:14.631
Where you in prison?

01:03:14.908 --> 01:03:16.750
No, but I've seen the movies.

01:03:17.368 --> 01:03:18.146
Just open it.

01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:25.211
Why are you trying to find Mike Beale's mask?
Can't we just go make out something?

01:03:25.395 --> 01:03:29.286
Because it's the real mask. From the Maine Machete Massacre films.
An original prop.

01:03:32.688 --> 01:03:34.040
Scoobie's here, mon.

01:03:43.561 --> 01:03:44.875
My god.

01:03:45.083 --> 01:03:46.955
- Are those real?
- Artificial, mon.

01:03:57.649 --> 01:03:58.588
Found it!

01:04:51.461 --> 01:04:52.313
Ginger!

01:04:59.601 --> 01:05:03.056
Ok. Otto test chase Nelson and Billy upstairs.

01:05:03.439 --> 01:05:06.786
Is got them cornered. He's got a knife.

01:05:08.310 --> 01:05:10.791
How do we get these guys back downstairs?

01:05:10.936 --> 01:05:11.898
Doesn't matter.

01:05:12.328 --> 01:05:13.036
We'll fix it later

01:05:14.533 --> 01:05:15.280
Shit! My glasses!

01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:17.161
My ankle. I twisted my ankle

01:05:18.024 --> 01:05:18.780
Let's go!

01:05:19.101 --> 01:05:20.679
You go, man. I'll hold them back

01:05:20.883 --> 01:05:22.028
I thought you were pacifist.

01:05:22.173 --> 01:05:23.903
I am. But I don't think he is.

01:05:23.903 --> 01:05:24.985
Let's go.

01:05:26.135 --> 01:05:27.310
Jump!

01:05:29.901 --> 01:05:30.645
You got this. Come on Billy

01:05:49.731 --> 01:05:51.939
Why the fuck is there a bear trap doing here?

01:06:20.431 --> 01:06:21.228
Shit. Another one?

01:06:30.104 --> 01:06:34.070
No pothead messes with my dog.

01:06:43.073 --> 01:06:44.986
And then he's like: “it's not big deal, babe”

01:06:48.138 --> 01:06:49.406
Do it again.

01:06:52.188 --> 01:06:54.063
It's not a big deal, babe.

01:06:58.168 --> 01:07:00.963
He would kill me if he knew I was telling you this story.

01:07:06.923 --> 01:07:08.158
Oh my God.

01:07:08.523 --> 01:07:09.023
What?

01:07:09.834 --> 01:07:12.271
The mysterious shed is open.

01:07:14.534 --> 01:07:18.245
What does that old fart keep in there anyway?

01:07:18.448 --> 01:07:21.030
Mike sad that he collects stuff.

01:07:23.536 --> 01:07:26.688
You want to go find out what stuff?

01:07:28.591 --> 01:07:30.514
That sounds stupid enough.

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:33.554
Let's do it.

01:07:39.278 --> 01:07:44.048
There's nothing that makes you feel fresh and
new is a shave and a shower. I tell you that.

01:07:44.401 --> 01:07:45.659
You looking for the bathroom?

01:07:46.685 --> 01:07:50.011
Well, you go to the top of
the steps. Then you go left. You go right .

01:07:51.034 --> 01:07:51.534
Thank you.

01:08:26.879 --> 01:08:29.786
I do not like cutting that volleyball scene.

01:08:30.037 --> 01:08:31.548
Right, but…

01:08:32.904 --> 01:08:33.404
It's time.

01:08:34.308 --> 01:08:34.808
It's money.

01:08:35.935 --> 01:08:37.095
And we're arriving low on both.

01:08:37.303 --> 01:08:37.803
I know.

01:08:39.372 --> 01:08:42.622
What's a slasher movie without
sexy girls playing volleyball?

01:08:42.778 --> 01:08:44.430
And we're losing that great line.

01:08:44.786 --> 01:08:47.095
Get it up! Get it up!!

01:08:48.685 --> 01:08:50.042
Well, you know what they say..

01:08:50.694 --> 01:08:52.419
Sometimes you have to kill your little darlings.

01:09:04.125 --> 01:09:07.768
Now quit flopping around like that.
You're gonna yourself.

01:09:12.888 --> 01:09:14.496
Look what I found.

01:09:16.247 --> 01:09:18.026
I found your little friend.

01:09:20.798 --> 01:09:23.581
Man, I thought I had lost that one.

01:09:25.183 --> 01:09:27.350
Yeah, I thought I had lost you, little fella.

01:09:32.286 --> 01:09:33.081
What…

01:09:33.196 --> 01:09:35.323
… the fuck was that?

01:09:37.078 --> 01:09:42.370
Hush. You push that screaming out now.
You save that for later.

01:09:42.813 --> 01:09:45.631
Dammit. Don't sneak up on me.
You scared the shit out of me

01:09:46.075 --> 01:09:48.366
I ain't even through playing with this one yet.

01:09:50.313 --> 01:09:52.595
Let me get a damn souvenir.

01:09:53.845 --> 01:09:54.799
That' tough.

01:09:57.658 --> 01:09:58.678
That's tough.

01:10:00.444 --> 01:10:01.448
I'm going to go check. Hello.

01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:05.388
Work on that ending, alright, man?.

01:10:08.799 --> 01:10:09.904
Akasha!

01:10:13.383 --> 01:10:15.703
Akasha, are you..?

01:10:44.423 --> 01:10:45.903
What the fuck...

01:10:46.096 --> 01:10:47.348
You little shit!

01:11:44.265 --> 01:11:45.061
What's that?

01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:46.813
I don't know.

01:11:48.205 --> 01:11:50.353
Do you think these are his collections?

01:11:51.371 --> 01:11:52.346
I don't know.

01:11:58.208 --> 01:12:00.308
Tiffany / blood feast

01:12:02.306 --> 01:12:04.356
Hannah / The Gore Gore Girls

01:12:06.271 --> 01:12:08.266
Robin' worst nightmare?

01:12:08.578 --> 01:12:09.883
So mundane

01:12:19.038 --> 01:12:20.944
Shit!. Holy … I think these are snuff films.

01:12:22.259 --> 01:12:26.069
No, that’s an urban legend, Amber. This is from
a Herschell Gordon Lewis movie. This is not real.

01:12:37.918 --> 01:12:39.123
That's real.

01:12:54.076 --> 01:12:55.181
Hey, girls!

01:12:55.238 --> 01:12:57.375
Me and Akasha have a great idea for a scene.

01:12:57.473 --> 01:12:58.285
When I see it?

01:13:18.375 --> 01:13:19.756
This one's still alive.

01:13:26.476 --> 01:13:28.223
I ate when I get that in my eye.

01:13:31.358 --> 01:13:32.314
Catch you later.

01:13:35.378 --> 01:13:36.998
What's going on, ladies?

01:13:38.654 --> 01:13:40.776
Oh my god. That's blood, isn't it?

01:13:42.259 --> 01:13:43.753
Yes, it is.

01:14:02.408 --> 01:14:04.109
Here. I know whether master fuse box is.

01:14:04.203 --> 01:14:07.166
If I cut the power you can go out and go for help.

01:14:07.375 --> 01:14:09.648
I'm not leaving you here.

01:14:09.734 --> 01:14:10.621
Just go!

01:14:34.886 --> 01:14:36.583
Now.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:09.254
Well, looks like we've got a blown fuse.

01:15:10.381 --> 01:15:16.595
I can give you a lot more pleasure alive than dead.

01:15:17.569 --> 01:15:19.424
I'm sure you can.

01:15:21.265 --> 01:15:23.955
Why don't you open that up and let's
see what you've got to play with.

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:34.299
You got three things I look
for most in a woman

01:15:35.428 --> 01:15:36.896
Yeah, what's that?

01:15:37.841 --> 01:15:38.946
Obedience…

01:15:39.511 --> 01:15:40.808
… and perky tits.

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:48.741
Why don't you relax and let me
have a look at that zipper of yours?

01:15:49.481 --> 01:15:54.538
I don't think that would be
a good idea after your last little stunt

01:15:56.183 --> 01:16:00.424
You know I didn't mean anything by it.

01:16:01.333 --> 01:16:03.368
Let me make up to you.

01:16:16.569 --> 01:16:18.508
How's that zipper calming, baby?

01:16:18.686 --> 01:16:20.083
Real good.

01:16:22.361 --> 01:16:23.009
Now!

01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:07.515
Where the hell is everybody?

01:17:17.285 --> 01:17:18.726
What do you want to do?

01:17:19.403 --> 01:17:20.876
I want to get the fuck out of here.

01:17:22.066 --> 01:17:23.631
I guess we have to get Shane first.

01:17:45.448 --> 01:17:46.198
Brian?

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:49.033
Brian?

01:17:54.691 --> 01:17:57.156
Did you steal your movie blood all over the place?

01:17:58.796 --> 01:18:02.540
Mr. Fish is going to kill us if we ruin floor.

01:18:14.814 --> 01:18:16.049
Jeez.

01:18:18.638 --> 01:18:19.806
Oh, Brian…

01:18:40.261 --> 01:18:41.964
Shane, Shane...

01:18:44.231 --> 01:18:46.358
You getting close that all-is-lost feeling?

01:18:47.776 --> 01:18:49.806
That's what your movie has to go, right?

01:18:50.866 --> 01:18:52.326
It sucks by the way

01:18:54.236 --> 01:18:55.814
That looks painful.

01:18:58.458 --> 01:19:00.006
Oh God, stop!

01:19:03.294 --> 01:19:05.660
Where are the others?

01:19:07.779 --> 01:19:10.931
Some of them are right here.

01:19:12.706 --> 01:19:15.563
Well. Two and half of them.

01:19:19.879 --> 01:19:22.279
I have to leave you for a minute, Shane.

01:19:24.294 --> 01:19:26.875
But you can watch one of my
home movies while you wait.

01:19:29.296 --> 01:19:31.044
See if you can recognize the male lead.

01:20:16.571 --> 01:20:17.810
Not the fucking face. Get the thumb!

01:22:08.265 --> 01:22:10.268
You some cold bitches.

01:22:10.805 --> 01:22:11.891
Drop it.

01:22:14.861 --> 01:22:15.718
You too.

01:22:24.946 --> 01:22:26.555
Put these on.

01:22:29.935 --> 01:22:32.091
Que merda é essa?

01:22:32.136 --> 01:22:35.075
Version cheerleaders - the movie?

01:22:35.145 --> 01:22:36.413
We're not virgins.

01:22:36.438 --> 01:22:37.955
You ain't cheerleaders either..

01:22:38.064 --> 01:22:41.108
But you will be in chains.

01:22:52.856 --> 01:22:53.633
Help.

01:22:55.603 --> 01:22:57.200
You guys gotta help.
They're killing everybody!

01:22:57.683 --> 01:22:58.956
Whoa there, young fella.

01:22:59.041 --> 01:22:59.893
Who's killing who?

01:23:00.123 --> 01:23:02.151
Back at the house. They're
killing everybody. You guys gotta...

01:23:02.203 --> 01:23:03.024
Is that your blood?

01:23:03.424 --> 01:23:04.443
Some of it.

01:23:08.886 --> 01:23:10.345
Hey you been smoking?

01:23:10.906 --> 01:23:12.993
Now, it's in my clothes.

01:23:14.468 --> 01:23:17.611
No. I had to kill a dog and Nelson
got stuck in a bear trap.

01:23:19.451 --> 01:23:21.299
Explain this.

01:23:22.561 --> 01:23:24.339
I was saving this for the wrap party.

01:23:24.793 --> 01:23:28.618
Wow, rapper boy. Explain it to
the judge on Monday

01:23:28.939 --> 01:23:31.149
No, Monday will be too late.

01:23:31.296 --> 01:23:32.831
They will all be dead by then.

01:23:40.571 --> 01:23:43.286
You girls are ready for primetime.

01:23:44.866 --> 01:23:46.271
Mike, are you there?

01:23:49.774 --> 01:23:51.026
I'm here. What do you want?

01:23:51.314 --> 01:23:53.265
I want to know what the fuck is happening?

01:23:54.098 --> 01:23:55.923
When I find out, I'll let you know.

01:23:56.463 --> 01:23:57.016
What?

01:23:57.273 --> 01:23:58.853
I said I'll let you know when it's time.

01:23:59.378 --> 01:24:01.641
Then get a move on, goddamnit!

01:24:01.808 --> 01:24:03.609
I will. God damn you.

01:24:05.571 --> 01:24:07.125
You girls be good now.

01:24:15.528 --> 01:24:16.183
Hurry.

01:24:24.138 --> 01:24:25.258
I'll be okay. Go!

01:24:34.341 --> 01:24:35.138
Fake!

01:24:46.568 --> 01:24:47.751
Busy night.

01:24:50.214 --> 01:24:52.358
That still hurts?

01:24:53.766 --> 01:24:54.950
Where is Chloe?

01:24:55.866 --> 01:24:56.731
Where is Amber?

01:24:57.865 --> 01:24:59.540
Tied up at the moment.

01:25:00.154 --> 01:25:01.383
Did you like my movie?

01:25:01.636 --> 01:25:04.236
I know. Crappy production value.

01:25:04.756 --> 01:25:06.288
Surprised you didn't figure it out.

01:25:07.153 --> 01:25:10.038
A repairman who just happens to be an actor?

01:25:10.293 --> 01:25:13.366
Coincidence? I think not.

01:25:14.330 --> 01:25:16.623
I sent Tom to you, Shane.

01:25:17.390 --> 01:25:19.240
I manage Fair Oaks Properties.

01:25:20.825 --> 01:25:21.325
Now.

01:25:22.951 --> 01:25:24.964
I'm going to take your mind off of that pain.

01:25:26.293 --> 01:25:27.996
But like any good doctor.

01:25:28.353 --> 01:25:30.513
I want to explain what I will be doing

01:25:32.538 --> 01:25:34.696
I'll make an incision right here.

01:25:34.938 --> 01:25:35.973
Stop, Mike! God dammit. Stop.

01:25:37.133 --> 01:25:38.901
What the movies never show is.

01:25:39.256 --> 01:25:41.573
How is the intestines just explode.

01:25:42.071 --> 01:25:43.081
Out of any opening down here.

01:25:44.151 --> 01:25:45.628
They're under so much fresher.

01:25:45.736 --> 01:25:47.734
Fuck, Mike. Why are you doing this?

01:25:48.503 --> 01:25:51.200
Let me see. How about this?

01:25:51.551 --> 01:25:53.656
I'm a psychopathic sadist.

01:25:54.111 --> 01:25:55.828
Will that do?

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.526
It's time to get to work.

01:26:00.686 --> 01:26:02.563
We'll have to start without Tom.

01:26:17.446 --> 01:26:18.984
Just like in your movie,

01:26:19.573 --> 01:26:21.931
Which I don't see getting into any film festivals,

01:26:22.858 --> 01:26:24.040
A small difference

01:26:25.383 --> 01:26:26.281
I'm here

01:26:28.976 --> 01:26:30.271
And this ...

01:26:31.379 --> 01:26:32.020
is…

01:26:34.546 --> 01:26:35.321
…real!

01:26:46.251 --> 01:26:48.433
Hello, little girl.

01:26:55.609 --> 01:26:56.299
Where is Shane?

01:26:56.388 --> 01:26:58.221
He's back in the shed with Mike.

01:26:58.371 --> 01:27:00.350
Making a new movie for my collection.

01:27:01.391 --> 01:27:02.725
It's a closed set.

01:27:03.781 --> 01:27:05.484
Why are you doing this?

01:27:05.798 --> 01:27:09.898
Killy is a lot more fun when you
make a game out of it.

01:27:10.185 --> 01:27:11.408
It's not again.

01:27:12.186 --> 01:27:17.158
Don't you know better and to
bring a knife to a gunfight?

01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:21.428
It's not a knife.

01:27:21.813 --> 01:27:23.129
It's a machete!

01:27:33.839 --> 01:27:36.375
Stay, Harry! Stay!

01:27:43.431 --> 01:27:46.145
Jesus, I have way too many machetes.

01:27:49.154 --> 01:27:51.088
Don't be a pussy, Shane.

01:27:51.685 --> 01:27:54.504
I've made that cut on dozens
of women and haven't lost but two.

01:27:55.848 --> 01:27:58.104
But they all scream just like you, by the way.

01:27:58.450 --> 01:27:59.236
You ready?

01:28:00.191 --> 01:28:01.363
This is going to stink a little bit.

01:28:01.411 --> 01:28:02.598
No. No. No.

01:28:03.621 --> 01:28:06.968
Get away from him, you twisted fuck.

01:28:09.886 --> 01:28:11.984
Chloe to the rescue!

01:28:12.908 --> 01:28:15.035
Man, v you could make a young Ripley.

01:28:17.948 --> 01:28:19.158
I'll be fair.

01:28:40.903 --> 01:28:42.033
Much better.

01:28:42.183 --> 01:28:43.681
You bastard!

01:28:43.741 --> 01:28:46.408
Please. I just choked her out.

01:28:47.456 --> 01:28:49.873
This is gonna be fun.

01:28:56.033 --> 01:28:57.873
I'm going to cut you in half.

01:28:58.524 --> 01:29:00.171
Beginning right here.

01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:05.330
I don't think so, fuck face.

01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:10.286
Wrong blade, bitch.

01:29:26.970 --> 01:29:27.996
Hey, Mike?

01:29:34.169 --> 01:29:36.008
See, Shane?

01:29:36.843 --> 01:29:38.581
Just like I said.

01:30:13.768 --> 01:30:14.576
Wait!

01:30:17.053 --> 01:30:19.088
Leave the gun.

01:30:20.368 --> 01:30:21.958
Get the camera.

01:30:25.556 --> 01:30:26.435
And… cut!

01:30:26.524 --> 01:30:27.564
It's a wrap!

01:30:31.318 --> 01:30:32.319
Really cut.

01:30:33.194 --> 01:30:34.308
I want one more.
