20:41.762 --> 20:43.242
Hey, so, um,

20:43.285 --> 20:45.156
I just got off the phone
with the lab.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.376

20:47.420 --> 20:49.291
of foundation was used on Kevin.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.814

20:50.858 --> 20:53.991
It's Dev's, if that
wasn't completely clear.

Dev's our guy.
Let's go.

20:58.779 --> 20:59.780

Open up or we're coming in.

21:12.706 --> 21:15.796

In here.

21:18.451 --> 21:20.104
Dev's not the killer.

21:20.148 --> 21:21.932
He's the next victim.

21:28.852 --> 21:30.463
He's still breathing.
EMTs are on their way.

21:30.506 --> 21:31.855
Dani and JT are coordinating
with hotel security.

21:31.899 --> 21:32.987
No discernible wounds.

21:33.030 --> 21:34.075
I'm guessing he was poisoned?

21:34.118 --> 21:35.250
I found a broken glass.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.556
He was drinking something.

21:36.599 --> 21:37.426
No smell.

21:37.470 --> 21:39.298
Whoa, did you just...

21:39.341 --> 21:42.431
Oh. No, um... yes,
I shouldn't have done that.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.433
Uh, so, sweet taste, odorless.

21:44.477 --> 21:46.392
Could be ethylene glycol.
Antifreeze?

21:46.435 --> 21:48.350
It's a common poison since it
tastes like artificial sweetener

21:48.394 --> 21:50.744
-when mixed in a drink.
-What's that gonna do to him?

21:50.787 --> 21:52.049
Shut down his organs,
eventually.

21:52.093 --> 21:53.399
As the body
metabolizes the chemical

21:53.442 --> 21:55.270
it starts converting
into other toxins,

21:55.314 --> 21:57.794
like acetone and glycolic acid
and formaldehyde.

21:57.838 --> 21:59.448
Oh, my God.
Formaldehyde.

21:59.492 --> 22:03.104
The killer's already started
the embalming process.

22:03.147 --> 22:04.453
Wow, that is genius.

22:04.497 --> 22:07.151
What can we do?
His pulse is getting weaker.

22:07.195 --> 22:09.110
I don't think he's gonna
make the ambulance.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.243
You went to med school, right?

22:12.287 --> 22:14.071
No.
I mean, I did, yes.

22:14.115 --> 22:17.031
But that... th-th...
t-that's different.

22:17.074 --> 22:19.555
You knew everything
about the poison, Edrisa.

22:19.599 --> 22:20.774
You can save him.

22:20.817 --> 22:21.992
No.

22:22.036 --> 22:23.472
I-I don't sa-save people.

Pretend you're in the morgue,
there's no rush,

22:48.454 --> 22:51.935
you just need to reduce
his toxicity levels.

22:51.979 --> 22:53.850
Is there an antidote?

22:53.894 --> 22:56.418
I-I don't know... Um...

32:29.817 --> 32:32.472
To get close to her former team
and access Dev's suite.

32:32.515 --> 32:34.082
That's good.

32:35.910 --> 32:37.085
Who you calling?

32:37.129 --> 32:39.479
Speaking of relationships
to preserve,

32:39.522 --> 32:41.785
I owe someone an apology.

32:44.919 --> 32:46.573
Edrisa, listen,

32:46.616 --> 32:48.357
-I need to tell you I'm sorry.
-EDRISA: You really don't.

32:48.401 --> 32:50.664
But what I said at the hotel,
I didn't mean to imply

32:50.707 --> 32:52.796
that you don't help people.
That's crazy.

32:52.840 --> 32:55.103
You were right.
I panicked.

32:55.147 --> 32:58.019
It's the reason I became an M.E.
instead of a clinician.

32:58.063 --> 33:01.544
-I can't handle the stress.
-Edrisa.

33:01.588 --> 33:04.112
I have to go.
Bye.

33:07.594 --> 33:09.465
Edrisa sounded weird.

33:09.509 --> 33:12.033
What is weird for her?

33:12.077 --> 33:14.818
Well, she didn't want
to talk to me just now.

33:14.862 --> 33:16.864
Plus, her voice sounded
shakier than normal.

33:16.907 --> 33:18.387
She didn't want to talk to you?

33:18.431 --> 33:21.042
Right?
I'm gonna go check on her.

33:22.391 --> 33:24.132
Call me with an update.

33:25.177 --> 33:26.221
I'll admit, I was

33:26.265 --> 33:27.831
surprised to hear from you.

33:27.875 --> 33:31.661
Well, you may have
heard about that little pickle

33:31.705 --> 33:34.055
I've gotten myself into,
legally speaking.

33:34.099 --> 33:36.014
A bit more than a pickle.

33:36.057 --> 33:37.711
All day, everyone
has been telling me

33:37.754 --> 33:40.670
how bad it is. So bad, in fact,
that I should hire

33:40.714 --> 33:42.846
the bottom-feeding lawyer

33:42.890 --> 33:45.240
my ex-husband used.
I know.

33:45.284 --> 33:47.590
And honestly, I almost did it,
but then I remembered

33:47.634 --> 33:50.202
I am not The Surgeon.

33:50.245 --> 33:51.812
I am Jessica Whitly.

33:51.855 --> 33:54.684
And what I need
the most right now...

33:54.728 --> 33:56.077
is someone I can trust.

33:56.121 --> 33:59.559
Who also happens to be
a kickass attorney.

33:59.602 --> 34:02.779
A happy coincidence.
[chuckles]

34:05.913 --> 34:07.697
What happened with Malcolm...

34:07.741 --> 34:09.656
He has...

34:09.699 --> 34:11.614
a lot of demons.

34:14.139 --> 34:15.531
Yes, he does.

34:17.490 --> 34:20.058
More than just what you know.

34:25.324 --> 34:27.543
He saw things

34:27.587 --> 34:29.067
that his father did.

34:32.244 --> 34:34.724
He went through a hell
I didn't even know about.

34:36.030 --> 34:38.119
I was gonna say,

34:38.163 --> 34:40.382
deep down,

34:40.426 --> 34:43.690
I know your son is a good man.

34:45.387 --> 34:46.736
And that's because of you.

34:46.780 --> 34:48.564
Oh. Oh, uh...

34:48.608 --> 34:50.392
So, yes.

34:50.436 --> 34:52.133
I'll help.

35:12.458 --> 35:13.981
Now!

35:20.379 --> 35:21.858
-DANI: Yeah?
-I was right,

35:21.902 --> 35:23.033
Edrisa's in trouble.

35:23.077 --> 35:24.600
Leanne's here and she's armed.

35:24.644 --> 35:26.385
She must be after Kevin's body.

35:26.428 --> 35:28.082
W-Why would she
want to steal his corpse?

35:28.126 --> 35:29.997
It makes sense
for a necrophiliac.

35:30.040 --> 35:32.391
She was interrupted
at his house before she could

35:32.434 --> 35:33.740
enjoy her time with him.

35:33.783 --> 35:36.090
Enjoy her...
That's insane.

35:36.134 --> 35:38.005
She couldn't have Tilda or Dev,
so Kevin was her only...

35:38.048 --> 35:39.311
Bright, stop profiling,

35:39.354 --> 35:40.660
we'll be there any second.

35:40.703 --> 35:42.357
-Just wait for backup.
-Right.

35:42.401 --> 35:44.142
Absolutely.

35:53.629 --> 35:56.545
Go get Kevin now.

35:56.589 --> 35:58.417
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Who are you?

35:58.460 --> 36:01.202
Just a friend, here to talk.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.552
Edrisa, are you okay?

36:03.596 --> 36:05.902
I'm fine!
Now just get out of here!

36:05.946 --> 36:08.688
Seems like you're
still mad at me.

36:08.731 --> 36:11.473
-Please just go.
-Shut up, both of you.

36:11.517 --> 36:13.258
Now go get him.

36:14.346 --> 36:16.435
I'm sorry,
I'm not going to do that.

36:16.478 --> 36:19.220
You're just gonna
have to shoot me.

36:19.264 --> 36:21.266
BRIGHT:
Let's just do
what Leanne says, okay?

36:21.309 --> 36:23.442
-It's just a body.
-No.

36:23.485 --> 36:25.487
He is not just a body.

36:25.531 --> 36:27.315
EDRISA:
She's right. I'm sorry,

36:27.359 --> 36:30.318
these aren't just dead bodies,
they're people

36:30.362 --> 36:35.149
who share their
final moments with me.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.238
It's the ultimate privilege
to be their last witness,

36:37.282 --> 36:38.848
and I won't let anyone
dishonor that.

36:38.892 --> 36:40.415
You're dishonoring Kevin.

36:40.459 --> 36:42.504
If you really cared,

36:42.548 --> 36:45.072
y-you'd let him go.

36:45.115 --> 36:47.422
No, no, no.
I'm honoring him.

36:47.466 --> 36:50.208
I'm getting us our lives back,
so go get him.

36:51.426 --> 36:53.428
No.

36:53.472 --> 36:54.603
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

36:54.647 --> 36:58.128
Uh, what if we all go together?

36:58.172 --> 36:59.869
Bright.

37:01.480 --> 37:04.047
Good.
Good, yeah, yeah.

37:04.091 --> 37:08.138
Come on, come on.

37:17.322 --> 37:19.846
Tell me, honestly...

37:27.157 --> 37:28.724
...is this really
how you want him?

37:28.768 --> 37:31.292
You have no idea what I want.

37:31.336 --> 37:34.252
I know how appealing it would be
to live in the past.

37:34.295 --> 37:36.906
You'd go back
to before the fire, right?

37:36.950 --> 37:38.952
A year ago?

37:38.995 --> 37:42.869
You think that's when
life got hard for me?

37:42.912 --> 37:46.307
I was six...

37:46.351 --> 37:49.528
when I found my mom
dead in her bed.

37:49.571 --> 37:51.573
I crawled...

37:51.617 --> 37:53.575
right under the covers with her.

37:53.619 --> 37:56.970
Nobody found us

37:57.013 --> 37:58.972
for 12 hours.

37:59.015 --> 38:02.105
Do you know

38:02.149 --> 38:06.240
how cold skin can feel
after 12 hours?

38:08.503 --> 38:11.158
That's why you embalm people.

38:12.464 --> 38:14.335
You give them back warmth.

38:15.902 --> 38:19.166
A life where
they can't leave you.

38:20.559 --> 38:21.690
I get it.

38:21.734 --> 38:23.997
I do.

38:25.999 --> 38:27.435
Real relationships

38:27.479 --> 38:29.959
can be hard as hell,

38:30.003 --> 38:32.484
life is full of risk,

38:32.527 --> 38:35.356
and death is messy.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.793
But we can't run away from it.

38:41.493 --> 38:43.364
I can't run away from it.

38:47.150 --> 38:48.935
We need to face it.

38:50.284 --> 38:52.460
Maybe...

38:52.504 --> 38:55.071
...maybe we can both
face it together.

38:56.116 --> 38:57.770
What do you say, Leanne?

39:07.170 --> 39:08.389
-What was that?!
-What?

39:08.433 --> 39:09.825
I'd almost talked her down.

39:09.869 --> 39:13.002
You just said life
was about taking risks.

39:13.046 --> 39:14.961
W-W...
Weren't you talking to me?

39:16.266 --> 39:18.356
Of course.
Yeah.

39:19.879 --> 39:21.184
-[door opens]
-JT: Police!

39:21.228 --> 39:23.448
Put your hands behind your back.

39:29.454 --> 39:30.846
You guys okay?

39:30.890 --> 39:34.372
Yeah, yeah, uh, we're
all good here. I handled it.

39:36.461 --> 39:38.158
I see you.

39:41.640 --> 39:43.424
Hey, uh...

39:43.468 --> 39:45.818
-Yeah?
-Thank you.

39:45.861 --> 39:47.863
For what?

39:49.082 --> 39:50.518
Everything you said today--

39:50.562 --> 39:51.954
turns out...

39:51.998 --> 39:54.392
I was listening.

39:54.435 --> 39:56.394
Leanne brought it all out of me.

39:56.437 --> 39:57.612
Death.

39:57.656 --> 39:59.397
Letting go.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.529
[chuckles]

40:01.573 --> 40:03.096
It was great.

40:03.139 --> 40:06.055
Only you would find it
therapeutic talking to a killer.

40:06.099 --> 40:08.493
[chuckles] You're the one
I like talking to.

40:09.494 --> 40:10.712
And I promise

40:10.756 --> 40:13.541
I'm gonna do better.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.919
-[sighs]
-[door slams]

40:44.964 --> 40:46.922
I'm going to kill your son.

40:46.966 --> 40:48.750
-No, please...
-But first,

40:48.794 --> 40:51.361
you have to tell me something.

40:51.405 --> 40:52.885
Why?

40:53.755 --> 40:54.974
Why?

40:55.017 --> 40:57.324
Why did you do this to me?

40:58.978 --> 41:00.632
Oh...
[clears throat]

41:00.675 --> 41:02.285
Well, I mean...
[chuckles]

41:02.329 --> 41:04.418
I mean, that's up there
with life's great questions,

41:04.462 --> 41:06.028
isn't it?

41:06.072 --> 41:08.117
What's at the center
of a black hole?

41:08.161 --> 41:10.076
Uh, why do birds
suddenly appear? [chuckles]

41:11.599 --> 41:13.601
Why did I put you in a box?
Because...

41:14.733 --> 41:16.212
I wanted to.

41:16.256 --> 41:17.518
-Martin...
-No. Listen, listen.

41:17.562 --> 41:19.477
I'm not being flip,
that's the truth.

41:19.520 --> 41:21.653
Anything else is-is a guess.

41:21.696 --> 41:23.698
No, it-it-it's this brain
I was born with,

41:23.742 --> 41:26.527
or because my mommy
didn't love me enough,

41:26.571 --> 41:27.963
or maybe she loved me too much,

41:28.007 --> 41:31.010
or because daddy
did horrible things to me.

41:31.053 --> 41:32.577
Because, because, because.

41:32.620 --> 41:36.494
What does it matter if
the end result is... the same?

41:38.583 --> 41:40.323
[chuckles]

41:40.367 --> 41:42.935
I just realized something.

41:43.849 --> 41:46.112
Oh, this might be a nightmare.

41:47.722 --> 41:49.724
But it's my nightmare.

41:50.682 --> 41:52.684
And I'm not a regular person.

41:53.685 --> 41:54.903
Am I?

41:54.947 --> 41:57.123
No, you're not.

41:57.166 --> 42:00.256
You're a predatory psychopath.

42:01.040 --> 42:03.390
That's right,

42:03.433 --> 42:05.261
I am.

42:05.305 --> 42:07.263
And what does that mean?

42:07.307 --> 42:10.136
That you're always in control.

42:13.443 --> 42:14.706
Yes.

42:16.621 --> 42:18.666
I am.

42:21.408 --> 42:23.889
You know, I once told my son

42:23.932 --> 42:26.195
monsters don't exist.

42:27.762 --> 42:29.372
But that was a lie.

42:32.637 --> 42:34.856
You know the truth,

42:34.900 --> 42:37.380
don't you?

42:37.424 --> 42:39.600
What are you going to do?

42:39.644 --> 42:41.341
[gasps]

42:47.347 --> 42:49.175
BRIGHT:
Hello, Dr. Whitly.

42:53.658 --> 42:55.660
I'm going back to my family,
of course.

42:59.011 --> 43:00.578
They need me.

43:08.890 --> 43:10.718
My boy.
