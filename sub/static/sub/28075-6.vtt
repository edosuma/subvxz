08:44.480 --> 08:46.846
Hey, everybody, it's Andy Cohen.

08:46.948 --> 08:48.203
I'm here in the Bravo Clubhouse

08:48.289 --> 08:50.850
with two guests who put
the dish in distinguished.

08:50.952 --> 08:52.486
He's starring as Lord Licorice

08:52.588 --> 08:55.422
in this summer's biggest
blockbuster, "Candy Land,"

08:55.516 --> 08:56.790
Patrick Wilson.

08:56.899 --> 08:58.399
Whoo-hoo. Hi, Andy, how are you?

08:58.424 --> 08:59.428
Great to see you.

08:59.530 --> 09:01.295
And she's the mom of ChaseDreams

09:01.397 --> 09:02.996
and the author
of the new children's book

09:03.098 --> 09:07.401
"DolphinDreams," Pat Dubek.

09:07.503 --> 09:09.135
I'm so excited to be here. Hi, Andy.

09:09.238 --> 09:10.770
I'm so happy to see you.

09:10.872 --> 09:13.151
I got to say,
I am obsessed with your son.

09:13.237 --> 09:14.841
The two of us should collab.

09:14.943 --> 09:16.710
You should. On what?

09:16.812 --> 09:18.144
Speaking of sons,

09:18.247 --> 09:20.158
your other son
is bartending for us tonight.

09:20.237 --> 09:22.630
Say hi to Cary Dubek.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.474
Hi, I'm an actor.

09:24.575 --> 09:27.364
And what have you got
for us tonight, Mr. Actor?

09:27.443 --> 09:31.290
Oh, uh, I didn't... I didn't
really prepare anything,

09:31.392 --> 09:35.061
but I guess... I guess I can do
"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern."

09:35.163 --> 09:39.417
We must be born with
an intuition of mortality.

09:39.442 --> 09:40.867
You know what, I actually meant

09:40.969 --> 09:42.468
what cocktail are you serving tonight?

09:42.570 --> 09:43.870
Oh, uh...

09:43.948 --> 09:45.041
But that was still very good, honey.

09:45.104 --> 09:46.636
- Yeah, that was great.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:46.714 --> 09:48.141
And I like your fancy new hair.

09:48.243 --> 09:49.768
Oh, no, the... this isn't new.

09:49.854 --> 09:51.811
This is... this is just my hair.

09:51.836 --> 09:52.769
I know, but I saw you this morning.

09:52.794 --> 09:53.858
It definitely looked different.

09:53.925 --> 09:55.858
Oh, my God.

09:55.960 --> 09:58.901
It's like I'm still
living paycheck to paycheck.

09:58.964 --> 10:01.196
I can barely pay rent.

10:01.298 --> 10:03.507
That gig in Paris, we all
had to pay for our own travel.

10:03.532 --> 10:05.333
God, I love hearing this.

10:05.436 --> 10:07.603
I mean, oh, girl.

10:07.705 --> 10:09.337
And my feet, they are bad.

10:09.440 --> 10:11.974
Every time I post
a fun pic of them by the pool,

10:12.076 --> 10:13.777
it gets flagged
as inappropriate content.

10:13.839 --> 10:17.112
Oh, sorry, that's me.

10:17.214 --> 10:18.847
It's just that, um, your toes
aren't supposed

10:18.950 --> 10:20.583
to point at each other.

10:20.685 --> 10:24.053
And I'm 30, which is, like,
you know, old for a dancer.

10:24.154 --> 10:26.488
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

10:26.591 --> 10:29.958
W-w-what are your passions?

10:30.060 --> 10:31.993
- I like to travel.
- Okay.

10:32.096 --> 10:34.696
Maybe I could travel across the country,

10:34.798 --> 10:38.533
be a travel agent... travel writer...

10:38.635 --> 10:40.202
travel photographer.

10:40.304 --> 10:42.070
Now, Patrick, I heard
on "Candy Land" you had

10:42.172 --> 10:44.672
sort of a running prank
with Margot Robbie.

10:44.774 --> 10:47.675
Yeah, yeah, okay, so Margot,
she plays Princess Lolly.

10:47.777 --> 10:49.944
- She hates sour cream.
- Uh-oh.

10:50.046 --> 10:53.200
So anytime she left her coffee out,

10:53.270 --> 10:54.616
I'd put sour cream in it.

10:54.641 --> 10:57.252
- [laughter]
- You little prankster.

10:57.277 --> 10:58.393
What?

10:58.418 --> 11:01.623
Uh, uh, you... you little prankster.

11:01.725 --> 11:04.092
Oh, yeah, yeah, yes. I am.

11:04.193 --> 11:05.426
Now, Pat, let's talk about your book.

11:05.528 --> 11:07.228
I have a copy right here.

11:07.330 --> 11:08.997
Oh, no, that's not my book.

11:09.099 --> 11:10.832
Oh, wait, yes, that is my book.

11:10.934 --> 11:12.900
I'm sorry. It came out great.

11:13.003 --> 11:14.166
Now, what's the book about?

11:14.244 --> 11:16.564
Well, Andy, it's seven thick pages.

11:16.650 --> 11:19.373
It's about a little dolphin from Ohio

11:19.475 --> 11:21.442
who posts a video on DolphinTube

11:21.544 --> 11:23.517
and then becomes
a famous dolphin singer.

11:23.620 --> 11:25.298
Ooh, is it based on anything?

11:25.368 --> 11:28.679
Why, yes, Patrick Wilson,
it is based on my son Chase.

11:28.704 --> 11:31.247
I know, I know.
I'm just... I was joking.

11:31.287 --> 11:32.302
Oh. [laughs]

11:32.357 --> 11:35.161
- That's funny. That's really good.
- What?

11:35.224 --> 11:37.057
Um, nothing.

11:37.160 --> 11:39.333
It's... I was just trying to connect.

11:39.411 --> 11:41.061
Okay, when we come back,

11:41.164 --> 11:42.887
our guests are gonna
take some audience questions.

11:43.012 --> 11:44.286
Ooh, fun. Even Cary?

11:44.387 --> 11:45.866
Uh, no, just the two of you.

11:45.968 --> 11:47.100
Oh, sorry, honey.

11:47.203 --> 11:49.236
- It's...
- We'll be right back.

11:49.338 --> 11:52.005
Or maybe I could
be in the music industry.

11:52.107 --> 11:53.240
I could be a rapper.

11:53.342 --> 11:54.988
You know, like a rap critic.

11:55.050 --> 11:56.441
Oh, my God, is this what I sounded like?

11:56.496 --> 11:58.512
You know what, I can do anything.

11:58.614 --> 12:00.181
The world is my oyster.

12:00.283 --> 12:01.582
I'm gonna try oysters.

12:01.684 --> 12:04.017
They are delicious.

12:04.119 --> 12:06.119
They're fine. They're bad.

12:06.222 --> 12:08.455
Listen, Genevieve,
you don't have to know

12:08.558 --> 12:11.591
exactly what you want to do,
like, in this car.

12:11.693 --> 12:13.593
But if you want
to make a change, you should.

12:13.695 --> 12:16.862
Starting over at 30 is scary, trust me,

12:16.964 --> 12:19.765
but it's worth it if you're not happy.

12:19.867 --> 12:24.070
And, hey, I'm here for you.

12:24.172 --> 12:26.406
- Really?
- Yeah, well, right now, I am.

12:26.508 --> 12:27.907
I don't want to exchange
numbers or anything.

12:28.009 --> 12:29.147
You know what? You're right.

12:29.209 --> 12:30.780
I am gonna change my life.

12:30.827 --> 12:32.978
- Yes, girl.
- I'm gonna start over.

12:33.081 --> 12:34.447
Uh, slay, bitch.

12:34.549 --> 12:36.015
Thanks, Brooke.

12:36.117 --> 12:37.750
Tell them I left.

12:37.852 --> 12:39.151
Wait, what?

12:39.254 --> 12:45.591
Okay, um, I'd kill Evans,
marry Pratt, F Hemsworth.

12:45.693 --> 12:49.228
Okay, our next question
is from Angie in St. Louis,

12:49.330 --> 12:50.500
- and it's for you, Pat.
- Oh!

12:50.563 --> 12:53.484
"Hey, Pat, how do you juggle
being a mother and an author?

12:53.563 --> 12:55.935
Is there a Mr. Dreams
to lighten the load?"

12:56.037 --> 12:58.237
- Do I look in the camera?
- Sure.

12:58.339 --> 13:03.952
Um, no, um, he actually
passed away kind of recently.

13:04.045 --> 13:05.677
He had cancer.

13:05.780 --> 13:08.480
- Oh, fuck.
- I am so sorry to hear that, Pat.

13:08.582 --> 13:10.182
Well, uh, that's all the time we have.

13:10.284 --> 13:11.817
Thank you to Patrick Wilson.

13:11.879 --> 13:13.045
His movie's out Friday.

13:13.085 --> 13:16.086
Pat Dubek's book is on shelves now.

13:16.111 --> 13:18.056
- And our bartender, Cary.
- Hey, hang on.

13:18.158 --> 13:19.880
- That's it for us, everybody.
- Hey, hang on, Andy.

13:19.927 --> 13:21.961
Cary, you're an actor, right?

13:22.063 --> 13:23.796
You got anything you want to promote?

13:23.898 --> 13:26.427
Oh, uh, thanks, Patrick.

13:26.497 --> 13:29.364
Um, n-nothing right now.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.356
But that was very sweet of you, Patrick.

13:31.450 --> 13:33.839
All right, that's it for now.
Good night, everybody.

13:33.941 --> 13:37.635
[cheers and applause]

13:38.022 --> 13:39.436
<i>Okay, dancers up.</i>

13:39.499 --> 13:40.811
<i>Where's the last dancer?</i>

13:40.872 --> 13:42.913
Someone said she quit
to be a rap critic.

13:42.968 --> 13:44.975
<i>Well, why don't we
just do it without her?</i>

13:45.046 --> 13:48.228
We can't. She's right next
to the fuck boy... to Chase.

13:48.291 --> 13:50.724
<i>Okay, is there anyone else
who can fill in?</i>

13:50.826 --> 13:53.027
<i>Seven is an unlucky number.</i>

13:53.129 --> 13:55.428
<i>Can we find someone to fill in?</i>

13:56.732 --> 13:57.898
<i>Ugh.</i>

13:58.000 --> 13:59.867
- I can do it.
- I can do it.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.435
- Oh, sorry, I just...
- Oh, sorry, I thought I would...

14:01.498 --> 14:03.755
I watched rehearsal so I know,
like, the moves.

14:04.698 --> 14:06.724
You know what, Carl?

14:07.011 --> 14:08.770
I'm gonna take this one.

14:10.539 --> 14:13.422
Brooke Dubek's gonna dance.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.430
[overlapping chatter]

14:18.416 --> 14:19.782
Hi, Cary.

14:19.838 --> 14:21.989
Wasn't that so much fun?
Oh, don't forget to give them your mic.

14:22.014 --> 14:23.037
They didn't give me one.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.469
Mom, why did you say Dad died of cancer?

14:25.547 --> 14:27.484
What do you mean?
That's what we decided to tell Chase.

14:27.509 --> 14:29.658
Yeah, Chase,
not the whole viewing audience

14:29.683 --> 14:30.733
of "Watch What Happens."

14:30.758 --> 14:31.924
Well, I just figured Chase

14:32.026 --> 14:33.802
is gonna be watching it later so...

14:33.865 --> 14:37.091
- Did I mess up?
- [sighs] No, no, it's fine.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.797
The show isn't really live.

14:38.900 --> 14:40.665
- I'll figure it out.
- Okay, great, thanks, honey.

14:40.768 --> 14:42.067
I really have to run.

14:42.169 --> 14:44.661
I have a very big meeting
with Chase's team

14:44.747 --> 14:46.871
to talk about my next book.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.439
You have another book idea?

14:48.478 --> 14:49.845
Yes, it's gonna be about a dolphin mom

14:49.908 --> 14:51.794
who goes on a talk show. Bye.

14:53.213 --> 14:55.746
Okay, shit.

Sure.

15:40.025 --> 15:41.573
I'm surprised you volunteered.

15:41.627 --> 15:43.401
I thought the video was "too sexy."

15:43.471 --> 15:44.561

15:44.663 --> 15:45.996
because it's called "Stink."

15:46.098 --> 15:47.897
Then I saw the choreography
and I was like,

15:48.000 --> 15:49.935
- "It's not that bad."
- [chuckles] Yeah.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.769
Okay, dancers, let's change
into second looks.

15:52.871 --> 15:54.403
Time for the hardcore grinding shots.

15:54.506 --> 15:56.372
What?

15:56.475 --> 15:57.574
[knocks on door]

15:57.676 --> 16:00.109
Hi, um, I was wondering if we

16:00.211 --> 16:02.612
could edit a small thing
out of tonight's show.

16:02.714 --> 16:04.413
I can't edit out your nipples, kid.

16:04.516 --> 16:06.481
No, I wasn't, um... I wasn't
talking about my nipples,

16:06.506 --> 16:08.881
although now I am worried about them.

16:08.927 --> 16:10.435
Listen, we can't edit anything

16:10.490 --> 16:13.091
without Andy's approval,
and he's already in Barbados.

16:13.185 --> 16:15.522
How? It's been 20 minutes.

16:16.709 --> 16:17.889
He just is.

16:17.960 --> 16:20.296
Okay, gosh.

16:20.398 --> 16:21.664
Hey, how'd it go?

16:21.766 --> 16:23.099
- How was Andy?
<i>- He was nice.</i>

16:23.201 --> 16:25.542
He told Mom he and Chase should collab.

16:25.613 --> 16:27.167
- On what?
- That's not why I'm calling, though.

16:27.230 --> 16:29.815
Mom said Dad died of cancer.

16:29.918 --> 16:31.717

<i>- Yeah.</i>

16:35.733 --> 16:36.866
It's what I do now.

16:36.891 --> 16:37.990
How was bartending?

16:38.092 --> 16:39.758
I think bad.

16:39.860 --> 16:42.412
I just stood half-naked
behind mom all night.

when we were filming,

that there would be dancing
in this music video,

24:25.288 --> 24:27.029
and they were like,
there's going to be a rehearsal,

24:27.130 --> 24:28.298
and it sort of sounded super casual.

24:28.398 --> 24:29.531
And so I was like, um,

24:29.602 --> 24:32.347
okay so, I guess I have
to learn this dance,

24:32.415 --> 24:34.454

telling me the time,

And I was like... [groans]

24:54.514 --> 24:56.264
and I walked out one door
of the rehearsal room,

24:56.334 --> 24:58.167
and like, came back in the
other door and was like,

24:58.226 --> 24:59.361

25:15.356 --> 25:18.059
I really am like Pat. Let's be honest,

25:18.098 --> 25:20.082
- Are you?
- No!

25:20.175 --> 25:21.824
- Like, 10%? 20%?
- Values...

25:21.849 --> 25:22.810
- Values.
- Values.

25:22.856 --> 25:24.552
- Values.
- Yeah. [laughing]

25:24.599 --> 25:25.855
Values? [laughing]

25:25.954 --> 25:27.466
What are Pat's values? Family?

25:27.536 --> 25:29.310
- MOLLY: Family. Family.
- CHRIS: Family. Yeah, yeah.

25:29.380 --> 25:31.380
- Yeah, and spirituality.
- Yeah.

25:31.427 --> 25:32.691
I think I was going to say,

25:32.716 --> 25:35.223
just the way she's positive
about life and open,

25:35.293 --> 25:36.684
- Yeah.
- I feel like that too,

25:36.785 --> 25:38.121
I try to, I think I'm like that.

25:38.176 --> 25:39.793
- CHRIS: Yeah.
- I relate to her.

25:39.869 --> 25:41.348
We talked about that
in the writers room,

25:41.395 --> 25:43.106
that we like about your character,

25:43.206 --> 25:44.473
or hopefully what we were trying to do

25:44.574 --> 25:46.991
was not have her be like a stage mom.

25:47.016 --> 25:49.968
It's just sort of like, sure,
I love my son, and everyone in America

25:49.993 --> 25:52.172
is saying they love him too,
so I guess I love America.

25:52.219 --> 25:53.835
- I love this, this is great, like, yes...
- [all laugh]

25:53.891 --> 25:55.485
- like just saying yes to things.
- Yes.

25:55.585 --> 25:57.253
Has anyone done a year of yes?

25:57.353 --> 25:59.388
Or like, made a conscious
effort to be like,

25:59.503 --> 26:01.185
this year I'm going for it.

26:01.232 --> 26:03.342
I think I do, like, every January,

26:03.404 --> 26:05.318
and then by like, February 2nd,

26:05.365 --> 26:07.521
I'm like, I can't
remember, I don't know.

26:07.592 --> 26:10.596
I was going to try
to be more positive in 2018,

26:10.633 --> 26:13.736
and I made it to like, May. [laughs]

26:13.791 --> 26:16.672
- That's when we started shooting!
- [all laughing]

26:16.776 --> 26:19.409
Mom, why did you say dad died of cancer?

26:19.509 --> 26:21.353
What do you mean?
That's what we decided to tell Chase.

26:21.402 --> 26:24.658
Yeah, Chase, not the whole viewing
audience of "Watch What Happens".

26:24.747 --> 26:27.345
Well, I just figured, Chase is going
to be watching it later, so...

26:27.587 --> 26:28.925
Did I mess up?

26:29.021 --> 26:31.620
Just in general, I love
the idea of a woman...

26:31.720 --> 26:33.459
This isn't so much me cause I'm married,

26:33.496 --> 26:36.793
but I love a woman having
a very happy chapter two.

26:36.873 --> 26:39.262
Where they, you know...
Her husband passed away,

26:39.354 --> 26:41.431
but she's really like alive,

26:41.530 --> 26:43.987
and so full without,

26:44.081 --> 26:46.761
kind of a nice chapter
two at a nice age,

26:46.792 --> 26:48.276
I just think that's so true to life,

26:48.308 --> 26:50.799
and I see a lot of women
really happy that way,

26:50.872 --> 26:51.950
- Yeah.
- Kind of reinventing

26:52.020 --> 26:54.518
- themselves maybe after a divorce,
- Yeah.

26:54.610 --> 26:56.146
or a death of a spouse,

26:56.200 --> 26:57.680
in a very positive way.

26:57.746 --> 26:58.974
- Yeah, totally.
- I just love that.

26:59.081 --> 27:01.242
- Well, Molly, thank you for being here!
- It's my pleasure!

27:01.304 --> 27:02.492
Thank you for telling
us about Celebrity.
