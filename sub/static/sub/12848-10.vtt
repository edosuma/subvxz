00:04.305 --> 00:06.705
Dr. Callahan!
It's good to see you.

00:06.707 --> 00:08.307
You too, Bennett.
Meet Paul Cummings.

00:08.309 --> 00:09.241
Hey.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.276
Victim's over here.

00:10.277 --> 00:11.310
Out of the way!
Hey, coming through!

00:11.312 --> 00:13.195
What do we got?

00:13.196 --> 00:15.079
Jalen Dawson, 17.
Wind knocked the crane over,

00:15.082 --> 00:18.584
hit him on his head,
rolled over onto his leg.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.285
No luck reaching
his mom on her cell.

00:20.287 --> 00:22.421
State patrol's heading
to their house now.

00:22.423 --> 00:24.456
Pupils are fixed and dilated.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.091
Stop bagging.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.363
T.C.,
no corneal reflex.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.134
Is that bad?

00:35.136 --> 00:36.735
This is Clayton Timmons.
He owns the quarry.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.604
This is Dr. Callahan
and Dr. Cummings.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.572
The blow to his head
looks like it was too severe.

00:40.574 --> 00:43.275
I'm sorry,
but he's brain-dead.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.544
- He's not gonna make it.
- You got to do something.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.781
- I don't believe it.
- Don't give up, man.

00:48.783 --> 00:50.082
Ah, man.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.600
That's it?

00:51.601 --> 00:53.117
You have to do something.
He's just a kid.

00:53.120 --> 00:55.487
I-I-i understand that this
is hard to hear, all right?

00:55.489 --> 00:58.190
But he suffered total and
irreversible loss of brain function.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.459
All we could do right now is
make him as comfortable as possible

01:00.461 --> 01:02.161
before he passes, okay?

01:02.163 --> 01:03.746
I'm sorry, again.

01:03.747 --> 01:05.330
It's gonna be an hour,
maybe less.

01:05.331 --> 01:08.267
He was leaving for Duke
in two weeks. Damn shame.

01:08.269 --> 01:11.470
T.C., he's young and healthy,
major organs intact.

01:11.472 --> 01:12.671
He could be a donor.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.173
- Right, maybe... maybe Brianna.
- Yeah.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.674
And if not her,
then somebody else.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.843
Okay, Brianna.
There you go.

01:17.845 --> 01:21.246
Now you don't have to be stuck
in that bed all day.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.282
Thanks.
Does it go back all the way?

01:23.284 --> 01:24.483
Of course it does.

01:24.485 --> 01:25.851
Up, down... I don't know.
Press the buttons.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.252
There you go.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.587
Look at that.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.355
It's not quite
like a roller coaster,

01:30.357 --> 01:31.790
but it will do for now.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.392
I got more good news for you.

01:33.394 --> 01:35.160
You got bumped up
on the lung transplant list,

01:35.162 --> 01:36.361
so you are in the top five.

01:36.363 --> 01:39.665
That just means my lungs
are getting worse.

01:39.667 --> 01:42.134
I'm gonna have to go
on a ventilator soon, right?

01:42.136 --> 01:44.136
We'll figure it out, okay?

01:44.137 --> 01:46.137
Listen, you've had eight potential
donors in the past three weeks.

01:46.140 --> 01:46.839
That's promising.

01:46.841 --> 01:48.324
And none of them matched.

01:48.325 --> 01:49.808
And the reason they didn't match
was because you...

01:49.810 --> 01:51.543
Because I have to match not only
the blood type,

01:51.545 --> 01:54.630
but six surface antigens.

01:54.631 --> 01:57.716
It has to be perfect or they'll go
to someone else who is perfect...

01:57.718 --> 01:59.818
Which is never me.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.190
You're too smart
for your own good sometimes.

02:05.192 --> 02:06.892
You know that?

02:06.894 --> 02:08.160
Oh.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.197
You got this.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.367
Hey.
Tee, what's going on?

02:15.369 --> 02:17.169
I'm on scene with a brain-dead
trauma victim...

02:17.171 --> 02:18.604
Healthy, young college kid.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.472
Listen... his family hasn't
okayed him as a donor yet,

02:20.474 --> 02:22.508
but Paul is drawing blood
to check for a match.

02:22.510 --> 02:24.243
Really? So you're
bringing him in here?

02:24.245 --> 02:25.761
Well, not yet.

02:25.762 --> 02:27.278
He's pinned under a crane
at a quarry.

02:27.281 --> 02:29.281
But we're gonna send the blood
over to you with a trooper.

02:29.283 --> 02:31.250
Drew, don't get your hopes up.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.784
It's a long shot.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.419
They aren't.

02:34.421 --> 02:35.487
Thanks.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.889
So, it wasn't a rumor.

02:36.891 --> 02:38.590
The hospital is really getting
sold to Hobart insurance?

02:38.592 --> 02:40.626
Not necessarily.
They made a low-ball offer.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.395
Hobart's ruthless.

02:42.396 --> 02:44.163
They bought my cousin Cherion's
hospital in Tulsa.

02:44.165 --> 02:45.765
They gutted the staff

02:45.766 --> 02:47.366
and turned the ER
into a plastic surgery center.

02:47.368 --> 02:48.667
We're screwed.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.203
Not if we can get
the county to take us over.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.872
We have a great argument...
Only ER for this community.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.275
I'm banging on budgets to make
the numbers work and save our jobs.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.277
Thanks, Toph.
I'm not holding my breath.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.778
All right, let's get him set up
with ortho next week.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.280
Yeah, you got it.
Hey, Jordan.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.182
Where's the gallstone patient
you paged me about?

03:03.184 --> 03:04.616
Trauma 3.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.585
Hey, uh, I switched
and got Saturday off.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.287
I was thinking brunch.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.655
Uh... Can't, Jos.

03:09.657 --> 03:11.557
Uh, I'm training clients all...
All day.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.225
May... maybe Sunday?

03:13.227 --> 03:14.493
Yeah. Okay.

03:16.931 --> 03:18.697
What?

03:18.699 --> 03:20.332
That tone is the same tone

03:20.334 --> 03:22.601
that I use on dates
when I'm not interested.

03:22.603 --> 03:23.969
I-I was good
with netflix and chill,

03:23.971 --> 03:26.338
but now it's all plans
and brunch and...

03:26.340 --> 03:27.823
Mm-hmm.

03:27.824 --> 03:29.307
Then be honest with her, okay?
End it.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.642
Don't waste the woman's time.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.911
It's not that simple, okay?

03:32.913 --> 03:34.513
There's gonna be fallout in the workplace
if you know what I mean.

03:34.515 --> 03:35.681
And I know that you do.

03:35.683 --> 03:37.483
That was mean!

03:37.484 --> 03:39.284
They just gonna ignore me
every step of the way, huh?!

03:39.286 --> 03:41.253
- I told you I do not want to come here!
- And I explained to you...

03:41.255 --> 03:43.255
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.
What is going on? Sir!

03:43.257 --> 03:45.657
18-year-old sent from dialysis
with a clotted fistula.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.593
<i>Dad</i> wanted to go somewhere else.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.895
No, no, no! Not somewhere else,
<i>anywhere</i> else!

03:49.897 --> 03:51.697
Your doctor
is the one who hit him!

03:51.699 --> 03:53.599
Mr. Martin, Malik,
my name is Dr. alexand...

03:53.601 --> 03:54.766
He knows who you are,
all right?!

03:54.768 --> 03:56.001
And so do I.

03:56.002 --> 03:57.235
He's paralyzed.
He's not stupid.

03:57.238 --> 03:58.270
Malik?

03:58.272 --> 03:59.838
Hell... hell no!
No!

03:59.839 --> 04:01.405
That bastard doesn't go
anywhere near my son!

04:01.408 --> 04:02.541
Okay, Malik's fistula
is clotted.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.842
He missed dialysis.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.444
Well, then I need to put in
a temporary catheter.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.980
No, no!
Anybody but him!

04:07.982 --> 04:11.316
Mr. Martin, I'm sorry, but I'm
the only surgeon here right now.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.885
Okay.
Dr. Clemmens is right.

04:13.887 --> 04:16.288
Without dialysis,
his potassium levels will climb

04:16.290 --> 04:17.522
and his heart could stop.

04:17.524 --> 04:18.957
Let's get him to trauma 2.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.760
Fine.
But she goes in there, too.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.396
The name is Jordan,
and whatever you want.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.265
Okay, we'll keep you
updated on our end.

04:26.267 --> 04:28.533
Okay, transplant team is mobilizing now.

04:28.535 --> 04:30.452
Let's hope the mom
gets here soon.

04:30.453 --> 04:32.370
Yeah, his blood pressure's
dropping, and here's the blood.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.340
Okay.

04:34.341 --> 04:36.308
Get this to Dr. drew Alister,
San Antonio memorial asap!

04:36.310 --> 04:37.376
He's expecting it.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.810
Help!

04:38.812 --> 04:40.479
Somebody help!

04:40.481 --> 04:42.531
Please!
Ignore it.

04:42.532 --> 04:43.080
Somebody! We need help!

04:43.105 --> 04:44.582
Just the punk-ass kids from
the trailer park up the road,

04:44.585 --> 04:46.918
always playing pranks.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.670
We were doing jumps by the pit,

04:48.671 --> 04:50.421
- then Robbie fell in a sinkhole!
- No, he...

04:50.424 --> 04:52.424
Please! Come on!

04:54.695 --> 04:57.996
Help! Let's go! Help!
Get me out of here!

04:57.998 --> 04:59.765
Help!

04:59.767 --> 05:01.500
Hold on, buddy!

05:01.502 --> 05:02.634
Help!

05:02.636 --> 05:04.436
Help me, help me!
I'm sinking!

05:04.438 --> 05:05.437
Please!
Hold on, hold on!

05:05.439 --> 05:06.672
Okay.

05:06.674 --> 05:07.873
Hurry!

05:07.875 --> 05:09.074
Hang on, Robbie!

05:09.076 --> 05:10.259
- Please!
- We got you.

05:10.260 --> 05:11.443
Hold on, Robbie!
Hold on, hold on. I got you.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.445
We're gonna get you out!

05:13.447 --> 05:15.781
Timmons, get Bennett!

05:15.783 --> 05:17.349
I can't reach it!
Hold on.

05:19.000 --> 05:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:35.102 --> 05:36.468
Grab the hose! Hold on!

05:36.470 --> 05:37.769
Hang on!
Help is almost here!

05:37.771 --> 05:38.804
We're gonna get you
out of here, okay?

05:38.806 --> 05:40.439
Hold on, buddy.

05:40.441 --> 05:43.642
We got a ladder, doc!
Just try to pull yourself up.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.577
Here! Use these!

05:45.579 --> 05:48.046
Cut the hose in half
and have him breathe through it.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.382
Go get a rope!

05:52.052 --> 05:55.687
Grab it!
Use the hose to breathe!

05:55.689 --> 05:57.055
T.C., he's going under!

05:57.057 --> 05:58.990
I'm coming, Robbie!
Hold on!

05:58.992 --> 05:59.992
Rope!

06:06.667 --> 06:08.600
T.C., keep pulling.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.969
Don't let go. He's coming up.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.904
T.C., keep pulling.

06:12.906 --> 06:15.407
You got him!

06:15.409 --> 06:16.608
Pull!

06:16.610 --> 06:19.678
- Let's go!
- Okay. Come on.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.714
His breathing's getting labored.
He's lost consciousness!

06:22.716 --> 06:24.416
We got to get him
out of here now! Let's go!

06:24.417 --> 06:26.117
Here we go.
Come on, Robbie. Stay with me!

06:26.120 --> 06:29.087
Don't you dare try and make
me the asshole and you're his savior.

06:29.089 --> 06:29.664
This is not good.

06:29.689 --> 06:31.390
Now don't forget who
put Malik in that chair.

06:31.392 --> 06:33.625
Oh, I remember,
every single day.

06:33.627 --> 06:36.061
But I also saved Malik's life,
and if you would let me,

06:36.063 --> 06:37.562
I could make his life
better now.

06:37.564 --> 06:38.997
Better? Yeah?

06:38.999 --> 06:40.465
- Well, we don't need your pity.
- Okay.

06:40.467 --> 06:43.001
This isn't pity.
I'm trying to help.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.870
Whoa. Whoa, whoa!
Stop, stop, stop.

06:44.871 --> 06:46.738
Malik does not need the two of
you out here fighting.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.908
What he does need is dialysis.

06:49.910 --> 06:52.444
Fine. I'll suture in a line
and page nephrology.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.714
Aah.

06:55.716 --> 06:56.982
Mr. Martin,
are you okay?

06:56.984 --> 06:58.950
Yeah.
I-i-I'm fine.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.719
I'm calling a private ambulance,

07:00.721 --> 07:02.454
and I'm taking us back
to the dialysis center.

07:02.456 --> 07:03.588
There's no need to do that.

07:03.590 --> 07:04.890
No, we're out of here.

07:04.892 --> 07:05.924
Aah!

07:05.926 --> 07:07.025
Okay.

07:07.027 --> 07:07.859
Ugh.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.428
Whoa! What's going on?

07:09.430 --> 07:11.563
Um, it could be anything.
Let's get him into trauma 1.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.598
- Okay. We got you.
- Will you sit down?

07:14.802 --> 07:16.668
Okay.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.071
Okay, trooper brought
the blood in from the scene.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.773
Maybe Brianna is... good.
No, no. Don't... don't even, okay?

07:21.775 --> 07:22.874
Let's see if, uh,
the blood matches.

07:22.876 --> 07:23.876
I'll be in the lab.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.519
Bennett, get him
on high-flow o2.

07:34.521 --> 07:36.688
Ah, dumb-ass had it coming.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.023
Are you blaming
the victim now, Timmons?

07:38.025 --> 07:40.025
"Victim"? Please.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.994
Little bastards sneak
in here, tag my rigs,

07:42.996 --> 07:44.730
mess with my machinery.
Okay, okay, okay.

07:44.731 --> 07:45.711
There's something blocking

07:45.736 --> 07:46.465
his airway. He can't breathe.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.733
Bennett, we need the
laryngoscope now. Come on.

07:48.735 --> 07:50.101
Come on.
He's gonna code.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.838
I'll put an I.V.
How's it looking?

07:52.840 --> 07:55.574
There's gravel blocking
his airway. I can't intubate.

07:55.576 --> 07:59.544
Okay. We need to crike him, now.
Come on.

07:59.546 --> 08:01.713
- There's no kit in here, T.C.
- what?

08:04.117 --> 08:06.218
He's coding.

08:06.220 --> 08:09.054
Starting cpr.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.590
If we don't have a crike,
we're gonna make one ourselves.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.069
Okay.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.737
Cut the chamber right here.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.139
Okay, hand me the bag.

08:33.080 --> 08:35.647
Wow. I have...
Never seen that before.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.816
Yeah, well, sometimes
you got to wing it, right?

08:41.504 --> 08:42.753
It's working.
I feel the pulse.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.523
Watch out, watch out!
Coming through.

08:44.525 --> 08:45.858
Give them room.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.192
Okay. Bennett, you go help
Paul, all right?

08:47.194 --> 08:49.127
Get him to the chopper
as fast as you can.

08:49.129 --> 08:53.164
Let's go.
One, two, three.

08:53.166 --> 08:56.801
Got it.

08:56.803 --> 08:59.137
Timmons,

08:59.139 --> 09:02.207
there anybody
we can call for Robbie?

09:02.209 --> 09:04.676
The sheriff?
Kid's a Travers.

09:04.678 --> 09:06.578
He'll be in jail
by the time he turns 18,

09:06.580 --> 09:07.679
just like his brothers.

09:07.681 --> 09:08.847
Timmons, I got you're upset.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.849
Yeah, I'm upset!
Damn right I'm upset!

09:10.851 --> 09:14.019
There's a kid with a full ride to Duke
laying over there, brain-dead,

09:14.021 --> 09:16.006
and that chucklehead
Travers kid survives?

09:16.031 --> 09:17.022
No thanks to you.

09:17.024 --> 09:20.225
Look... show some respect,

09:20.227 --> 09:22.594
or I will put you in the ER
myself.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.348
T.C.'s headed out
on the chopper.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.950
Okay.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.151
Is that the mother?

09:46.153 --> 09:48.186
Yeah.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.955
You ask her yet?

09:49.957 --> 09:52.924
I, uh...
I wanted to give her some time.

10:00.367 --> 10:01.800
All right.
That's drew.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.736
Brianna's first two antigens
matched,

10:04.738 --> 10:06.298
so I guess we're
gonna need to know now.

10:22.222 --> 10:24.089
Is he in any pain, doc?

10:24.091 --> 10:26.691
He can't feel anything,
Mrs. Dawson.

10:26.693 --> 10:28.693
Okay.

10:28.695 --> 10:31.763
I-I'm sorry
to have to ask you this,

10:31.765 --> 10:34.165
uh, but is your son
an organ donor?

10:35.802 --> 10:37.736
A donor?

10:37.738 --> 10:40.872
We... we have a sick little girl
at our hospital

10:40.874 --> 10:42.340
that will die
if she doesn't get new lungs.

10:42.342 --> 10:45.310
We... we thought Jalen
might be a match.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.381
W-we don't have much time
in these situations.

10:49.383 --> 10:51.983
You see it's...
It's, uh...

10:51.985 --> 10:53.885
It's...
It's a way to salvage...

10:53.887 --> 10:55.387
"salvage"?

10:55.389 --> 10:56.921
You want to "salvage" him?

10:56.923 --> 10:59.090
No, I'm...
Mrs. Dawson, I'm sorry. I...

10:59.092 --> 11:00.992
No.
Get away from me.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.328
Mrs. Dawson...
Get the hell away from me.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.697
Get the hell away from me!

11:11.805 --> 11:13.304
What do you want to do?

11:14.708 --> 11:15.791
Come on.

11:15.792 --> 11:16.875
Let's keep them comfortable.
Come on.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.410
Find a tent,
get them out of this wind.

11:18.412 --> 11:19.811
Yeah, yeah.

11:23.450 --> 11:26.251
That's just my ulcer acting up.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.386
Okay, your blood pressure
is sky-high.

11:28.388 --> 11:31.389
You are obviously
in a lot of pain.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.058
When was the last time
you saw a doctor?

11:33.060 --> 11:35.360
Not a lot of time to take care
of myself these days.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.263
Had to quit my job
to take care of Malik.

11:38.265 --> 11:39.331
Hmm.

11:39.332 --> 11:40.398
That's a huge adjustment.

11:42.035 --> 11:46.037
Well, Malik... he's lucky
to have a father's comm...

11:46.039 --> 11:47.105
Hey, can you pause that, please?

11:47.107 --> 11:48.239
What?

11:48.241 --> 11:49.340
What is it, doc?

11:49.342 --> 11:51.276
Your pain isn't from an ulcer.

11:51.278 --> 11:53.211
You have an aneurysm.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.779
Now, if you look right there,
your aorta...

11:54.781 --> 11:56.047
Aah!

11:56.049 --> 11:58.049
- It's starting to tear. Page Dr. Clemmens!
- Aah!

11:58.051 --> 11:59.718
Aah! Aah!
Let's go!

12:03.824 --> 12:05.490
Get him prepped.
I'll scrub in.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.061
Are you okay?

12:10.063 --> 12:11.229
Yeah.

12:11.231 --> 12:14.032
I just...

12:14.033 --> 12:16.834
I've been waiting a year to do something
for this family besides write a check,

12:16.837 --> 12:19.838
and I finally have my shot,
and I... and I...

12:19.840 --> 12:21.773
I-I don't know.
Okay, hey, hey, hey.

12:21.775 --> 12:23.007
You're overthinking this.

12:23.009 --> 12:25.477
I put Malik in a wheelchair.

12:25.479 --> 12:26.878
I can't make him an orphan, too.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.080
You won't.
Okay, I'll scrub in.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.783
We can do this,
me and you... easy-peasy.

12:31.785 --> 12:34.085
Okay. Let's do it.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.820
Okay.

12:38.859 --> 12:40.309
Toph, I got the blood work back,

12:40.310 --> 12:41.760
and I told myself I wouldn't get
excited, but holy crap.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.862
No, no!
Five of the six antigens match.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.180
- We've never had more than three.
- Okay.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.497
It's gonna happen.
She's gonna get her lungs.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.966
Look... I-it's an
impossible situation.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.068
You did your best.
Okay.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.804
You hear what I said?
She's gonna get her lungs.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.506
Drew, that was Paul.

12:54.508 --> 12:56.307
Jalen's mother said no.

12:58.044 --> 12:59.344
She can't say no.

12:59.346 --> 13:00.779
Five of the six match.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.280
Bri's so close.
Why did she say no?

13:02.282 --> 13:05.016
I don't... I don't know.
She's... she's his mother.

13:05.018 --> 13:06.640
That's not... I'm gonna
I-i got to go out there.

13:06.664 --> 13:07.418
To do what, exactly?

13:07.420 --> 13:09.554
To tell her that her son's lungs
can save Brianna's life!

13:09.556 --> 13:12.490
The woman just lost
her only child, drew.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.894
Just imagine what you're feeling
times a thousand.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.128
I can change her mind.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.064
Paul is out there.

13:19.065 --> 13:20.999
He's doing everything
there is to do out there.

13:21.001 --> 13:23.168
I need you <i> here,</i> okay?

13:23.170 --> 13:26.437
Just take five, clear your head,
and get back to work.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.409
Hi, handsome.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.578
Hey, Jessica.

13:33.580 --> 13:36.347
Uh, you're looking for T.C.,
he's out in the field...

13:36.349 --> 13:37.382
Quarry accident.

13:37.384 --> 13:40.084
No, actually,
I'm looking for you.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.820
T.C. told me about
the Hobart sale.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.288
I have an MBA.

13:43.290 --> 13:45.990
He thought I could help,
said you hate paperwork.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.158
Those the budgets?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.928
Uh, yeah.
I've been, uh...

13:49.930 --> 13:51.362
I've been trying
to look for cuts

13:51.364 --> 13:54.899
so the county could take us
over, keep Hobart away.

13:54.901 --> 13:57.335
That's smart.
I could help you crunch numbers.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.938
I might see something
that you don't.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.841
It'd be a shame to see the ER
end up in the wrong hands.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.426
That's really generous.

14:04.427 --> 14:06.010
Yeah, well,
it will help me get laid later.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.979
I'm pretty sure you don't
need these to get that.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.848
But, um, sure!

14:09.850 --> 14:12.250
I mean, really?
Yeah!

14:12.252 --> 14:13.618
Thanks.
Yeah.

14:13.620 --> 14:14.986
I really could use the help.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.554
Uh, break room's all yours.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.089
Perfect.

14:18.090 --> 14:19.690
- Want any help?
- I got it. You're good.

14:21.877 --> 14:24.127
Got all the gravel out.
Gonna pull the crike now.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.133
Okay, okay.

14:29.135 --> 14:31.502
Take it slow.
It'll hurt a little bit to talk.

14:31.504 --> 14:34.405
You risked your life for me.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.407
Yeah.

14:36.409 --> 14:37.642
Couldn't let
a fellow rider down.

14:37.644 --> 14:40.178
So, what happened out there?

14:40.180 --> 14:42.914
I went up to video
the chopper on my phone.

14:42.916 --> 14:45.884
The gravel shifted on me,
like a sinkhole.

14:45.886 --> 14:48.119
That happens.

14:48.121 --> 14:50.521
Your, uh, parents
know where you are?

14:50.523 --> 14:52.924
My dad's
on a barstool somewhere,

14:52.926 --> 14:54.459
and my mom bailed on us.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.662
Timmons said you were a Travers,
like that meant something.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.931
My brothers are wild.

14:59.933 --> 15:02.033
Timmons hates us...
Whole town does.

15:02.035 --> 15:04.435
Me and my brother
were like that...

15:04.437 --> 15:05.670
The Callahan boys.

15:05.672 --> 15:09.908
I tried to outdo him.
I stole a car.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.944
The cops threw me in Baltimore
lockup for being a dumb-ass.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.481
And now you save dumbasses.
Yeah.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.650
I guess I just decided
to not listen to all the crap

15:18.652 --> 15:21.152
people were saying about me.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.354
I bet you could, too.

15:23.356 --> 15:26.457
I'm not exactly
college material.

15:26.459 --> 15:29.360
Neither was I until I decided
to do something about it.

15:29.362 --> 15:32.463
I'll make you a deal, all right?

15:32.465 --> 15:34.816
You get straight b's,
I'll buy you a bike.

15:34.841 --> 15:35.600
Aah!

15:35.602 --> 15:36.935
My legs...
They're burning up.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.937
Aah!
What's happening?!

15:38.939 --> 15:41.005
It burns! It burns!
It burns!

15:41.007 --> 15:42.007
Aah!

15:44.110 --> 15:46.978
I miss you, too, baby.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.614
Oh, you're so dirty.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.416
Oh, say it again.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.451
With the pink panties?

15:53.453 --> 15:55.720
Yeah.

16:00.694 --> 16:03.461
Sorry, uh...

16:03.463 --> 16:05.029
No one's ever in here.

16:05.031 --> 16:08.066
I am, ray.

16:08.068 --> 16:09.701
So take your booty call
somewhere else.

16:09.703 --> 16:12.136
Yeah, I'll just, uh...

16:19.646 --> 16:21.579
Oh. Hey, sorry.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.513
- I didn't mean to bother you.
- Oh, no, please.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.049
It's fine.

16:25.051 --> 16:27.251
I just talked
to Kenny about Brianna.

16:27.253 --> 16:29.880
So you heard the mother
wouldn't approve the donation.

16:29.905 --> 16:30.755
Yeah.

16:30.757 --> 16:33.157
That's why I'm here.

16:37.163 --> 16:40.231
You never see doctors in here.

16:40.233 --> 16:43.401
They'd rather play god
than talk to god.

16:43.403 --> 16:44.635
Not me.

16:47.007 --> 16:49.073
I like it here,

16:49.075 --> 16:51.042
feels like home.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.777
I was raised in the church.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.746
Literally.

16:54.748 --> 16:56.214
Your dad a preacher?

16:56.216 --> 17:00.118
He ran a bodega
in the lower ninth ward.

17:00.120 --> 17:04.255
We lost everything in Katrina

17:04.257 --> 17:07.558
and wound up
in a FEMA trailer here.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.428
Waited two years
for the government to help.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.763
Then a methodist church
took us in,

17:12.766 --> 17:15.633
helped us get on our feet again.

17:15.635 --> 17:19.436
Is that why
you're a social worker?

17:19.439 --> 17:21.772
Kids are powerless
in the system.

17:24.109 --> 17:26.778
And I...
I hated how that felt.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.148
Anyway

17:30.150 --> 17:31.870
We should probably do
what we came here for.

17:47.167 --> 17:51.269
I'm sorry, Mrs. Dawson,
about earlier.

17:51.271 --> 17:55.239
I can't imagine
what you must be going through.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.208
His daddy
was never in the picture.

17:57.210 --> 17:59.811
It was just me and him.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.413
He was going to be the first
person in my family to go to college.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.582
Sounds like an awesome kid.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.684
Yeah.

18:10.123 --> 18:11.856
He was my...

18:11.858 --> 18:14.225
Golden boy.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.129
I always thought he was
going to change the world.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.365
Well, he still can.

18:21.367 --> 18:24.268
Whatever you want to do is fine.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.204
And I am totally on your side.

18:26.206 --> 18:28.139
But I thought
you should know that

18:28.141 --> 18:30.408
we found Jalen's wallet
in his locker.

18:32.745 --> 18:35.413
He was a donor.

18:40.520 --> 18:42.553
That's what that means?

18:42.555 --> 18:44.489
That's what that means, yeah.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.257
He never mentioned that.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.660
The good ones rarely do.

18:52.198 --> 18:54.632
I am so sorry for your loss.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.591
Okay, uh, oh.

19:16.616 --> 19:18.256
Uh, let's run the tests, okay?

19:19.159 --> 19:20.825
Hey.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.730
No way.

19:25.732 --> 19:26.898
Yes.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.400
Yes, yes, yes, yes!
No, thank you!

19:29.402 --> 19:31.369
I... I'm gonna kiss you when you
get ba... yeah, no, I am.

19:31.371 --> 19:32.803
There's nothing
you can do about it.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.572
Okay. I will see you soon.

19:34.574 --> 19:35.557
Unbelievable!

19:35.558 --> 19:36.541
Paul convinced the mom
to say yes.

19:36.543 --> 19:37.441
Brianna's getting her lungs.

19:37.443 --> 19:38.843
Oh, my god!
Yes, yes!

19:38.845 --> 19:40.611
How'd he do that?!
I-i don't know!

19:40.613 --> 19:42.213
He... I...
You got to believe!

19:42.215 --> 19:44.215
Sometimes a hail Mary
just works.

19:44.217 --> 19:45.416
Yeah, right?!

19:45.418 --> 19:46.651
I mean... okay.

19:46.652 --> 19:47.885
Uh, can somebody call
the transplant team?

19:47.887 --> 19:48.953
I'm gonna book an or.

19:48.955 --> 19:51.255
- Uh, Nina?
- Yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.959
BP's holding in the 90s.

19:54.961 --> 19:58.329
Good.
Cutting the peritoneum now.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.231
Okay, what can I do?

20:00.233 --> 20:01.799
Uh, just retract

20:01.801 --> 20:04.936
and make a window in the
mesentery, and we'll be there.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.243
Damn it.
His aorta ruptured.

20:12.245 --> 20:14.478
Pressure's down to 64 systolic.

20:19.819 --> 20:22.887
Still falling.
43 over 22.

20:28.494 --> 20:31.429
Dr. Clemmens, do we
tie off the proximal aorta

20:31.431 --> 20:32.697
or use a clamp?

20:32.699 --> 20:34.632
I always forget that part.

20:38.504 --> 20:40.805
Uh... A clamp.
A tie won't hold.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.373
A debakey now.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.315
The bleeding stopped.

20:51.317 --> 20:52.583
BP's back up.

20:52.585 --> 20:53.851
86 systolic.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.620
Good.

20:55.621 --> 20:57.388
Soon as we get distal control,
we'll fix the aorta.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.924
Prep a three-centimeter
goretex graft.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.966
Way to get him back,
Dr. Clemmens.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.841
Want some coffee?
Yeah.

21:16.843 --> 21:17.975
How's it looking?

21:17.977 --> 21:20.344
Ugh, like the <i> Titanic.</i>

21:20.346 --> 21:22.046
You have too many patients
who can't afford to pay

21:22.048 --> 21:24.198
and you're
giving them elite care.

21:24.199 --> 21:26.349
Well, that's how we roll...
Treat everybody like family.

21:26.352 --> 21:30.321
Which is why your hospital
is broke and going to be sold.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.322
Here.

21:31.324 --> 21:33.324
What's that?

21:33.326 --> 21:34.992
"Michael Fuller."

21:34.994 --> 21:37.361
A headhunter I know.
Thank you.

21:37.363 --> 21:39.563
Your name came up
in conversation.

21:39.565 --> 21:41.299
He's been tracking you.

21:41.301 --> 21:42.500
I think you should
give him a call.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.435
Might have a better
gig for you...

21:44.437 --> 21:46.070
More money, shorter commute.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.805
Nice to be hunted.

21:47.807 --> 21:50.574
Mm, yes, that.

21:50.576 --> 21:52.610
You're taking care
of your mom, right?

21:52.612 --> 21:54.679
You'll have
a kid in college soon.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.447
Yeah, Lynn wants to be a doctor.

21:56.449 --> 21:59.483
I told her to do something more
reliable, like be a poet.

22:00.887 --> 22:03.721
Well, you'll have
a backup plan, then, right?

22:03.723 --> 22:05.456
What about the hospital's plan?

22:05.458 --> 22:07.758
I'm working on it.
Right.

22:07.760 --> 22:09.060
But...

22:09.062 --> 22:10.461
You should call Michael.

22:10.463 --> 22:12.563
Yeah. Sure.
Thanks.

22:17.804 --> 22:20.438
Hey, Toph!
Hey, we're on, man.

22:20.440 --> 22:21.806
What happened out there?

22:21.808 --> 22:23.374
He developed chemical burns
in the chopper

22:23.376 --> 22:24.542
and then
started runs of v-tach.

22:24.544 --> 22:25.688
He's coding.

22:25.689 --> 22:26.833
Tee, you got them, too, man.
What were you exposed to?

22:26.834 --> 22:27.978
I don't know.
Hurts like a bastard.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.447
Get drew to help you!
I'm going...

22:29.449 --> 22:30.448
No, no. No time.
He's in respiratory distress.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.961
Mollie, we need a bed in here!

22:31.962 --> 22:33.473
Okay. We can't.
Just keep him on the gurney!

22:33.474 --> 22:34.254
Let's go.
Take it, take it, take it!

22:34.279 --> 22:35.279
We got you, we got you.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.357
You paged me?
It's... 2:00 A.M.

22:39.359 --> 22:41.392
Bri, you should be sleeping.

22:41.394 --> 22:43.794
I heard the nurses talking.

22:43.796 --> 22:46.397
They said
I'm gonna get the transplant.

22:46.399 --> 22:48.466
Hmm.

22:48.468 --> 22:50.101
Of course, you did.

22:50.103 --> 22:51.869
I was...

22:51.871 --> 22:54.372
Waiting to tell you.

22:54.374 --> 22:57.541
But, yeah. The transplant team's
on the way.

22:57.543 --> 22:59.477
Cool.

22:59.479 --> 23:02.380
Bri...

23:02.382 --> 23:03.914
It's okay to be scared.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.649
It's normal.

23:07.453 --> 23:09.687
It's weird.

23:09.689 --> 23:11.722
Like, I want
the transplant to happen,

23:11.724 --> 23:14.558
but I'm a little freaked out.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.528
They'd be removing my lungs.

23:17.530 --> 23:18.929
Hmm.

23:18.931 --> 23:21.499
They're kind of attached to me.

23:21.501 --> 23:22.800
Yeah, they are.

23:22.802 --> 23:25.102
Hey, but you're gonna be asleep
the whole time.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.506
But what if I don't wake up?

23:28.508 --> 23:31.776
Hey.

23:31.778 --> 23:34.445
These doctors, they perform
miracles every day.

23:34.447 --> 23:35.513
It's what they do.

23:39.185 --> 23:42.069
I get it, I do,

23:42.070 --> 23:44.954
but a lot of random things fell
in place for this to happen.

23:44.957 --> 23:48.192
It's not a coincidence.

23:48.194 --> 23:50.494
You really believe that?

23:50.496 --> 23:53.964
Yes, or nothing we do matters.

23:53.966 --> 23:56.033
And I can't live like that.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.435
You?

23:57.437 --> 23:58.502
No.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.539
Thanks.

24:01.541 --> 24:03.474
Hmm.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.580
We're hooked up
to a power generator.

24:09.582 --> 24:10.681
Should be enough power.

24:13.719 --> 24:14.919
Let's get started.

24:25.531 --> 24:27.798
I did a nerve block
and doubled the morphine.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.200
He won't feel anything.

24:47.587 --> 24:50.054
And clear. Clear.

24:50.056 --> 24:52.556
Refractory v-tach...
Third shock, no response.

24:52.558 --> 24:54.592
Doesn't make any sense.
He's 14, young, and healthy.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.494
Hand me 100 of lido.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.533
Wait, Toph.
Look at his qt intervals.

25:02.535 --> 25:03.751
It's prolonged.

25:03.752 --> 25:04.968
The calcium in his blood
is super low.

25:04.971 --> 25:07.038
That's what's causing all this.

25:07.039 --> 25:09.106
Okay, give me an amp
of calcium chloride. Thank you.

25:14.914 --> 25:17.748
Sinus rhythm.
Good call.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.250
- Strong pulse.
- Okay.

25:19.252 --> 25:20.284
Now we just need to figure out

25:20.286 --> 25:21.752
what's jacked up
his electrolytes.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.504
And yours, too.

25:23.505 --> 25:24.819
Uh, Mollie, can you run a full
chemistry on the both of them?

25:24.843 --> 25:25.255
Yeah.

25:25.258 --> 25:26.690
Toph, I'm good, I'm good.

25:26.692 --> 25:27.925
W... just to be sure.

25:27.926 --> 25:29.159
You were in the gravel with him.

25:29.161 --> 25:31.996
Let's go, superman.
You're not coding, too.

25:31.998 --> 25:33.797
After you get him to recovery,

25:33.799 --> 25:35.733
I want crit checks
every 30 minutes.

25:35.735 --> 25:37.134
See, you had that
the whole time.

25:39.539 --> 25:41.205
You can stop
pretending now, Jordan.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.607
It's just us.

25:43.609 --> 25:45.276
I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:48.147 --> 25:50.548
Come on.
You saved my ass in there.

25:50.550 --> 25:52.683
I would not have gotten through
that surgery without you.

25:52.685 --> 25:54.251
Is that clear enough?

25:54.253 --> 25:57.054
You would have done
the same thing for me.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.476
You know, I don't

25:58.501 --> 26:00.190
blame you for being scared.

26:00.192 --> 26:03.260
The family has changed your
life, you've changed theirs.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.162
You're bound to each other.

26:05.164 --> 26:07.798
I'm just glad
you were on tonight.

26:10.136 --> 26:11.136
Me too.

26:13.172 --> 26:15.172
You know, Scott,

26:15.174 --> 26:17.207
I really wasn't there for you
last year for the accident,

26:17.209 --> 26:18.943
and I'm...

26:18.945 --> 26:20.144
I'm sorry.

26:23.015 --> 26:25.149
You've got your own stuff
going on.

26:25.151 --> 26:28.085
No, Scott, no.

26:28.087 --> 26:31.355
You have always been there for me.

26:31.357 --> 26:33.574
When I had a stalker...

26:33.575 --> 26:34.772
You were the one

26:34.796 --> 26:35.792
who made sure that
I got home safe.

26:35.795 --> 26:38.696
And when I had a stroke, you're
the one who saved my life.

26:38.698 --> 26:41.198
And...

26:41.200 --> 26:44.735
When I lost the baby...

26:44.736 --> 26:48.271
You never left my side.

26:48.274 --> 26:50.708
And where else would I be?

27:00.408 --> 27:02.119
You're the best person I
know, Scott Clemmens.

27:02.121 --> 27:04.221
You're honest, you're loyal,

27:04.223 --> 27:07.257
you're decent, and you mean
everything that you say.

27:07.259 --> 27:11.328
And I know how rare that is.

27:16.268 --> 27:17.508
I never knew you felt that way.

27:21.907 --> 27:24.241
Well, I do.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.202
I should go...

27:52.204 --> 27:54.304
Check on him
before he gets into trouble.

27:54.306 --> 27:56.874
Yeah. Yeah.

28:06.052 --> 28:07.317
Kenny, this is Dr. angara.

28:07.319 --> 28:09.286
She runs the transplant team
for this region.

28:09.288 --> 28:10.754
Make sure she gets everything
she needs.

28:10.756 --> 28:12.356
Just a free or. We can hit
the ground running.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.574
The donation center said

28:13.575 --> 28:14.791
you have a transplant
candidate here.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.326
Yeah. She's 13.
She's got cystic fibrosis.

28:16.328 --> 28:17.461
She's at the top of the list.

28:17.463 --> 28:18.962
We'll do it tonight.
Good.

28:18.964 --> 28:20.364
I'm gonna make some calls.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.466
I don't normally get to share
good news at 2:00 A.M.

28:24.470 --> 28:27.271
You know, Nina's been asking
about you.

28:27.273 --> 28:30.074
She asked me about me.
That girl's not shy.

28:30.076 --> 28:32.376
And you're a delicate flower?

28:32.378 --> 28:33.277
Ask her out.

28:33.279 --> 28:35.279
I like her. I do.

28:35.281 --> 28:37.214
But...

28:37.216 --> 28:39.016
What?

28:39.885 --> 28:41.251
Right.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.487
Jos is fun, man...
Nothing serious.

28:43.489 --> 28:45.255
Oh, so you're
just gonna tread water

28:45.257 --> 28:47.391
your whole life
so you don't get hurt again.

28:47.393 --> 28:48.992
That ain't living, Kenny.
That's dying.

28:48.994 --> 28:50.394
Incoming!

28:50.396 --> 28:52.463
Hey, Dr. angara!
The donor's here!

28:52.465 --> 28:53.831
He's posturing.
Gave him a shot of mannitol.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.316
You don't have much time.

28:55.317 --> 28:56.800
We'll take it from here.
All right, let's go.

28:56.802 --> 28:58.368
I'll take you up
to your transplant team.

28:58.370 --> 29:00.304
Holy smokes!

29:00.306 --> 29:02.073
- Look at you!
- It's good to see you.

29:02.074 --> 29:02.516
How you doing?

29:02.541 --> 29:03.841
Where you out there while
this guy was showing off,

29:03.843 --> 29:04.918
doing a solo field amputation?
You kidding me?

29:04.942 --> 29:05.275
All right.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.111
Thank Bennett, all right?
He was a rock star.

29:07.113 --> 29:08.378
Well, I wouldn't have been there
without you.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.897
- Well, yeah.
- It's funny, huh?

29:09.898 --> 29:11.415
Yeah, I know, you can't make
this stuff up, huh?

29:11.417 --> 29:13.117
Hey! Yeah. Thank you for getting
her to say yes.

29:13.119 --> 29:14.151
Of course, man.

29:14.153 --> 29:15.953
Hey, hey.
That's Jalen's mom.

29:15.955 --> 29:18.188
Hey.

29:19.859 --> 29:22.192
Is there anything
that I could do for you?

29:22.194 --> 29:25.362
Can I see him one more time?

29:25.364 --> 29:26.830
Yeah, of course.

29:26.832 --> 29:28.265
I-I'll take you
to him, okay?

29:43.516 --> 29:45.849
We got in there
just in time, Mr. Martin.

29:45.851 --> 29:48.452
If you'd have left, you would
have bled out on the freeway.

29:50.322 --> 29:55.325
I'm grateful for you
saving my life, Dr. Clemmens.

29:55.327 --> 29:57.428
Of course.

29:57.429 --> 29:59.530
If you think I'm gonna forgive
you for what you did to my boy,

29:59.532 --> 30:02.099
that ain't happening.

30:02.101 --> 30:04.401
I'm not asking
for you to forgive me.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.470
I'm asking for you
to let me help.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.372
I forgive you.

30:11.076 --> 30:14.411
All this hate...
It almost killed you.

30:14.413 --> 30:16.480
Dad, just let it go.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.215
Boy, you don't know
what you're talking about.

30:18.217 --> 30:20.217
I'm not a boy!
I'm 18.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.319
I can make my own decisions.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.087
I want to explore
some of the treatments

30:24.089 --> 30:26.323
that Dr. Clemmens
researched for me.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.858
Well, that's great, Malik.

30:27.860 --> 30:30.060
But how did you know?

30:30.062 --> 30:31.495
I told him.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.230
I...

30:33.231 --> 30:34.964
Though Malik
needed to know his options.

30:34.967 --> 30:37.601
You talked to my boy
without my consent?

30:37.603 --> 30:39.369
Yes, I did.

30:39.371 --> 30:43.207
Mr. Martin, this accident
has torn apart your lives.

30:43.209 --> 30:44.441
But when are you going to start

30:44.443 --> 30:46.143
putting them
back together again?

30:46.145 --> 30:50.480
Now, Malik... he wants to,
but you <i> need</i> to.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.950
You got a second chance.

30:52.952 --> 30:54.318
Don't waste it.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.358
Excuse me.

31:05.397 --> 31:07.564
Dad, please.

31:11.437 --> 31:13.170
So...

31:16.008 --> 31:19.409
tell me about
some of these treatments.

31:19.411 --> 31:20.611
Okay.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.649
There are a couple of therapies
that we should discuss...

31:31.490 --> 31:32.756
T.C.
Huh? Oh.

31:32.757 --> 31:34.023
They said you got burned.
Oh, my god.

31:34.026 --> 31:35.743
Hey. Whoa.
Hey.

31:35.744 --> 31:37.461
I got exposed
to something in the field...

31:37.463 --> 31:38.962
Still waiting on the labs.

31:38.964 --> 31:41.198
Uh...

31:41.200 --> 31:44.268
By the way, thank you for helping
Toph out with the books tonight.

31:44.270 --> 31:45.469
That was cool.

31:45.471 --> 31:47.104
It's no big deal, really.

31:47.106 --> 31:49.072
No, it is, to me.

31:49.074 --> 31:51.975
It's his crusade,
and, uh, it means a lot, so...

31:51.977 --> 31:54.611
Well.
You okay?

31:54.613 --> 31:56.580
- Hey, T.C.
- yeah.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.548
Ah, evel knievel
is back out of CT.

31:58.550 --> 32:01.318
I, uh, heard you
fractured a few ribs.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.120
Yeah.
So, did my dad get here?

32:03.122 --> 32:05.222
I spoke to the sheriff.

32:05.224 --> 32:07.591
They checked his work,
but he never showed up today.

32:09.495 --> 32:12.229
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

32:12.231 --> 32:13.597
So, are you feeling better?

32:15.634 --> 32:18.135
Uh, much better now.

32:20.439 --> 32:21.972
All right.

32:21.974 --> 32:23.974
Robbie, this is Jessica...
Hi.

32:23.976 --> 32:25.475
My girlfriend.

32:25.477 --> 32:28.245
"Your girlfriend"?
That's a first.

32:28.247 --> 32:31.214
Yeah. You know, got to keep you guessing.

32:31.216 --> 32:33.250
Right. We better go.
I'll catch you later?

32:33.252 --> 32:35.252
- Yeah.
- Okay.

32:35.254 --> 32:36.253
Bye, Robbie.

32:36.255 --> 32:37.321
Bye.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.156
Hey, Jessica.
Here's that card.

32:39.158 --> 32:41.558
If this ship's going down,
I'm going down with it.

32:41.560 --> 32:44.428
That's a mistake.
You need to have a plan.

32:44.430 --> 32:45.529
I-I have a plan.

32:45.531 --> 32:47.064
What do you think about this?

32:47.066 --> 32:48.632
It's an election year.

32:48.634 --> 32:51.568
We pressure the county
supervisors to buy the hospital.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.570
That's not gonna happen.

32:53.572 --> 32:56.573
We make it about local jobs.

32:56.575 --> 33:00.143
That's not gonna happen because
Hobart already won the bid.

33:00.145 --> 33:02.245
No.
Wh... where'd you hear that?

33:02.247 --> 33:04.181
Hobart.

33:04.183 --> 33:05.449
Why wou...

33:05.451 --> 33:08.018
They hired me to run
their transition team.

33:08.020 --> 33:09.519
Hired you?

33:09.521 --> 33:11.288
You're a pharm rep.

33:11.290 --> 33:12.422
With an MBA.

33:12.424 --> 33:15.125
Wait a second.
You've seen all our books.

33:15.127 --> 33:17.561
I trusted you!

33:17.563 --> 33:19.529
You've been playing us
all this time?

33:19.531 --> 33:20.364
Look, Topher...

33:20.366 --> 33:21.732
Spare me.
I get it.

33:21.734 --> 33:23.167
I get that you're pissed, okay?

33:23.168 --> 33:24.601
But there's one more thing
that you need to know.

33:24.603 --> 33:26.153
What, that you're the devil?

33:26.154 --> 33:27.834
You're the first one
that's gonna be fired.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.543
Hobart wants their own ER chief.

33:33.545 --> 33:36.246
You don't have to be a martyr.

33:36.248 --> 33:38.582
Just take the damn card.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.686
Jesus.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.134
Those cops here for me?

33:57.136 --> 33:58.435
Yep.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.570
Look...
Timmons filed a complaint.

34:00.572 --> 34:03.240
Look... I know you think you
got no other option right now.

34:03.242 --> 34:05.342
That story of your life's
already written...

34:05.344 --> 34:07.310
It's not.

34:07.312 --> 34:08.712
There's good people out there...

34:08.714 --> 34:10.347
People you haven't even met yet

34:10.349 --> 34:12.114
who are gonna change your life
for the better,

34:12.117 --> 34:15.318
trust me.
Yeah, sure.

34:16.422 --> 34:18.221
Okay.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.456
Ugh, and the other kid...

34:20.458 --> 34:21.591
Jalen.

34:21.592 --> 34:22.692
The brainiac?

34:22.694 --> 34:24.226
He's in my brother garret's
class.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.196
Not anymore 'cause he's dead.

34:26.197 --> 34:27.664
But you're still here,

34:27.666 --> 34:30.833
so what are you gonna do
with that chance?

34:30.835 --> 34:33.136
Don't screw it up, all right?

34:39.078 --> 34:40.745
I didn't think we had

34:40.770 --> 34:42.411
a prayer of making it back.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.347
Sometimes, a prayer
is all you need.

34:49.304 --> 34:50.320
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:50.322 --> 34:53.489
Hell of a night, huh?
Sitting court side.

34:53.492 --> 34:54.918
I'm not letting

34:54.943 --> 34:56.226
Brianna's lungs out of my sight.

34:58.297 --> 35:00.297
There's... there's no other way
to say this.

35:00.299 --> 35:02.532
Her final lab came back.

35:02.534 --> 35:05.335
Her last antigen
doesn't match Jalen's.

35:07.406 --> 35:09.840
So she's not getting the lungs.

35:09.842 --> 35:12.275
Well, run it again. That's a mistake.

35:12.277 --> 35:14.611
They did... twice.

35:14.613 --> 35:17.280
Hold on,
she matched blood type...

35:17.282 --> 35:18.248
Five out of six antigens...

35:18.250 --> 35:19.716
I-it all lined up.

35:19.718 --> 35:21.718
When did you not get the sixth?

35:21.720 --> 35:23.687
I don't know,

35:23.688 --> 35:25.655
but there's a patient at
St. John's matching all six.

35:25.657 --> 35:28.595
So the... the

35:28.620 --> 35:31.294
odds of rejection
are a lot less.

35:31.296 --> 35:33.763
I'm sorry, drew.

35:33.765 --> 35:36.666
It's not fair. It's...

35:36.668 --> 35:40.303
she's a kid. She doesn't deserve this.

35:40.305 --> 35:42.506
You're right.
She doesn't.

35:50.349 --> 35:53.783
Hey, uh, Jos, um...

35:53.785 --> 35:54.918
hey.

35:54.920 --> 35:58.321
About Sunday... I, uh...
Um, yeah...

35:58.323 --> 36:00.457
I wanted to talk to you
about that, Kenny.

36:00.459 --> 36:02.592
Oh, you do?

36:02.594 --> 36:04.561
Um, look,

36:04.563 --> 36:06.496
I-I didn't want to do this
on our shift,

36:06.498 --> 36:09.499
but I thought you should hear it
from me.

36:09.501 --> 36:12.669
I got back with ray, my ex.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.404
Ray?

36:14.406 --> 36:16.373
With that ray?

36:16.375 --> 36:18.775
Uh, yeah.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.810
Um, you know,
we kept it on the dl.

36:20.812 --> 36:23.313
You know how it is dating someone at work.

36:23.315 --> 36:25.549
Oh, ye... I do know.

36:25.550 --> 36:27.784
And you're a great guy, Kenny.

36:27.786 --> 36:30.520
And you're gonna
find someone awesome.

36:33.926 --> 36:36.893
So, that little got her lungs.

36:36.895 --> 36:39.863
No, she, uh... she didn't.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.833
So it was a waste?

36:43.835 --> 36:45.936
No.
No, um...

36:45.938 --> 36:48.438
each one of these coolers contains

36:48.440 --> 36:51.408
a match for Jalen's organs.

36:51.410 --> 36:52.742
Here, look...

36:52.744 --> 36:55.345
Edward curry... heart...

36:55.347 --> 36:57.380
Father of three in Houston.

36:57.382 --> 37:00.951
Laurie Danario... liver,
single mom in little rock.

37:00.953 --> 37:04.854
Serena Owens... a freshman,
Texas a&m, kidneys.

37:04.856 --> 37:06.957
Juan Alvarez... lungs,

37:06.959 --> 37:10.427
music teacher, San Antonio.

37:11.797 --> 37:14.664
So, that's it.

37:14.666 --> 37:16.433
Jalen's gone now.

37:16.435 --> 37:18.702
Not to them, he's not.

37:18.704 --> 37:21.771
See, you were right.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.406
Your son did change the world.

37:29.248 --> 37:32.749
We were emotional, okay,
with Malik, his dad's surgery.

37:32.751 --> 37:33.783
We just...

37:33.785 --> 37:35.819
Needed to clear the air,
you know?

37:35.821 --> 37:37.254
It's what friends do.

37:37.256 --> 37:38.521
Yeah.

37:38.523 --> 37:40.724
So, do we need to do that now?

37:40.726 --> 37:41.558
No.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.426
Um... I'm good.

37:44.596 --> 37:45.328
You?

37:45.330 --> 37:46.363
I'm good.

37:46.365 --> 37:48.015
Okay.

37:48.016 --> 37:49.666
Good. Well, I'm glad
we cleared that up.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.034
- Yeah.
- Okay.

37:51.036 --> 37:52.769
Cool.

37:52.770 --> 37:54.503
Uh, I got to get changed.
Annie's picking me up.

37:54.506 --> 37:55.939
Yeah, I, um...

37:55.941 --> 37:57.907
I've got charts...

37:57.909 --> 37:59.042
That I have to do, so...

37:59.044 --> 38:00.744
All right.

38:03.849 --> 38:06.983
Topher told me everything.

38:06.985 --> 38:09.886
Hobart offered me the job
weeks ago.

38:09.888 --> 38:11.454
They wanted to know
more about the ER

38:11.456 --> 38:12.789
and the people who worked here.

38:12.791 --> 38:15.992
So, this is all lies...
You and me.

38:15.994 --> 38:17.827
No. No, I did not lie to you,
T.C.

38:17.829 --> 38:19.796
You lied to me every time
you didn't tell me.

38:19.798 --> 38:20.997
Yeah, you're working for people

38:20.999 --> 38:24.034
who want to destroy
everything I care about,

38:24.036 --> 38:27.937
who see sick people
as profit centers.

38:27.939 --> 38:30.907
I didn't know then that
I would feel the way I do now.

38:30.909 --> 38:31.975
I-I-i-i mean...

38:31.977 --> 38:33.443
Why do you think I told Topher?

38:33.445 --> 38:35.412
That... that's why I told him,
to save him.

38:35.414 --> 38:37.647
Mm.
<i>After</i> you saved the deal.

38:37.649 --> 38:40.817
You used me
to get to my friends.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.319
I know they're just numbers
on a ledger to you,

38:42.321 --> 38:44.587
but to me, they're my family.

38:44.589 --> 38:46.956
You mess with them,
and I'm done with you.

38:46.958 --> 38:50.327
I am done with you.

38:50.329 --> 38:51.594
T.C.

38:51.596 --> 38:53.997
T.C., I made a mistake!

38:53.999 --> 38:56.733
O-okay. You can punish me
or... or you can let me fix it.

38:56.735 --> 38:59.102
No. There's nothing to fix,
Jessica,

38:59.104 --> 39:00.937
'cause you're what's broken.

39:00.939 --> 39:03.973
Not the hospital,
not the patients,

39:03.975 --> 39:05.942
<i>not</i> the people who work here.

39:05.944 --> 39:08.011
It's you.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.131
Wait, please.

39:09.155 --> 39:10.013
Just listen to me
for one second.

39:10.015 --> 39:13.116
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry,
but I...

39:13.118 --> 39:15.418
I think I love you.

39:19.091 --> 39:20.890
Yeah.

39:20.892 --> 39:23.993
I was beginning to think
the same way about you, too.

39:26.031 --> 39:27.897
Thanks for clearing that for me.

39:36.330 --> 39:37.807
Yeah, I know she's at
the top of the list.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.676
It's just not a piece of cake.

39:39.678 --> 39:42.412
Well, look, w-whatever I can do
to help, you tell me.

39:42.414 --> 39:46.049
All right. Will do.

39:46.051 --> 39:48.618
Hey, uh...

39:48.620 --> 39:50.854
Hey, look...
You know, uh,

39:50.855 --> 39:53.089
if you want, we could talk about
this more over breakfast.

39:53.091 --> 39:57.060
- What about your complicated thing?
- I...

39:57.062 --> 39:59.095
I, uh...
Cleared that up.

39:59.097 --> 39:59.929
I-I have to be up-front
with people.

39:59.931 --> 40:01.030
It's just who I am.

40:01.032 --> 40:02.999
Mm, yeah.

40:03.001 --> 40:05.935
Well, that and your nurse friend
got back with her boyfriend,

40:05.937 --> 40:08.405
right, the brunette?

40:08.407 --> 40:10.707
You know, it is amazing
what you can hear...

40:12.411 --> 40:13.877
when you think
nobody's listening.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.011
It's always the quiet ones.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.580
Oh, you know what?
I'm not that quiet.

40:19.017 --> 40:20.784
See you at breakfast.

40:20.785 --> 40:22.552
Yes, you will.

40:26.425 --> 40:28.158
It's not your fault.

40:28.160 --> 40:30.006
I got ahead of myself,
and I let you down.

40:30.031 --> 40:30.693
You didn't.

40:30.695 --> 40:33.563
I always start off with the
worst-case scenario, anyway.

40:33.565 --> 40:34.831
Okay.

40:34.833 --> 40:36.533
How's this for a scenario?

40:36.535 --> 40:38.067
How about after you get
your lung transplant,

40:38.069 --> 40:39.936
you come stay with me and Rick?

40:39.938 --> 40:41.704
Are you serious?

40:41.706 --> 40:42.839
Yeah.

40:42.841 --> 40:45.575
Would... I wouldn't ask you
if I wasn't...

40:45.577 --> 40:47.143
I mean, it's up to you, but...

40:47.145 --> 40:50.146
Are you kidding?
Nothing would make me happier.

40:50.148 --> 40:53.049
You would have your own room
and yard and...

40:53.051 --> 40:55.652
You'd have two wildly
overprotective parents.

40:55.654 --> 40:56.986
You'd really let me stay
with you

40:56.988 --> 40:59.622
till I found
a new foster family?

40:59.624 --> 41:02.358
No.

41:02.359 --> 41:05.093
Bri, we want you
to <i> be</i> a part of our family.

41:05.096 --> 41:07.063
We want to adopt you.

41:07.833 --> 41:09.098
If you'll have us.

41:10.836 --> 41:13.102
Yes!

41:13.104 --> 41:16.105
Thank you!
Yeah.

41:16.107 --> 41:16.883
Too tight!

41:16.908 --> 41:17.908
Hmm? Sorry.

41:21.713 --> 41:23.246
How about you pass me
that remote?

41:23.248 --> 41:25.114
Come on.

41:25.116 --> 41:27.851
You just...

41:27.853 --> 41:30.019
I'm starting!
Just 'cause you know...

41:30.021 --> 41:31.855
Yeah.

41:31.857 --> 41:33.132
What are you doing?
What buttons

41:33.157 --> 41:34.207
are you -
dad always...
