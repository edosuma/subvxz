01:09.488 --> 01:11.321
June, wake the fuck up!

01:16.227 --> 01:18.261
What the fuck is goin' on?

01:22.165 --> 01:26.037
What don't you two gentlefucks
tell me what it is I can do for ya...

01:26.137 --> 01:29.173
...at 7 a.m. on a fuckin' Tuesday.

01:29.273 --> 01:31.116
Listen, cut the shit.

01:34.478 --> 01:35.943
You know why we're here.

01:38.015 --> 01:41.654
See, originally, the plan
was just to take your friend.

01:43.154 --> 01:46.039
The dead one over there with us.

01:49.326 --> 01:52.127
Looks like you're gonna
have to take his place.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.051
It's time to pay up.

02:10.864 --> 02:13.535
Alright, here's how it's gonna go.

02:13.935 --> 02:16.671
Either one of you raise those
my way and you're both gonna be...

02:16.771 --> 02:20.112
...a couple of fuckin' Jackson Pollocks
on the wall behind you!

02:22.476 --> 02:25.547
Look, you would've shot me
if you were man enough...

02:25.647 --> 02:28.317
...when I walked through the fuckin' door.

02:29.117 --> 02:32.854
You killed your best friend.
Your boss is done.

02:32.954 --> 02:34.838
Your income is gone.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.875
And so is your white pony ride.

02:39.593 --> 02:42.080
Let's face it, you're a fiend, kid.

02:46.633 --> 02:48.518
I know your family.

02:49.837 --> 02:52.574
They're gonna drop you quicker
than you dropped that little slut...

02:52.674 --> 02:55.177
...you've been whorin' around town with.

02:55.677 --> 02:57.946
I'll have you know...

02:58.046 --> 03:00.649
...that about two hours ago
I had my dick buried...

03:00.749 --> 03:04.485
...so deep inside that slut's ass.

03:04.585 --> 03:07.246
The one you're referring to, I assume.

03:07.722 --> 03:09.606
My girlfriend.

03:10.057 --> 03:14.754
And as for this fuck, he did it to himself.

03:16.564 --> 03:18.448
God knows why.

03:19.300 --> 03:22.721
Let's just just get this shit over with.
You know you're dead already.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.541
But if this is how it's gonna go...

03:29.510 --> 03:31.328
...then roll the curtains.

03:45.192 --> 03:47.077
You can't fight fate.

03:52.099 --> 03:56.170
I'll tell ya, if God's in this room...
he's one sick fuck.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.296
Name, date of birth.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.556
Nothin' to say for yourself?

04:16.557 --> 04:18.360
That's alright.

04:18.660 --> 04:21.279
No one leaves here without full disclosure.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.601
Take him to six.

05:03.972 --> 05:05.855
Let's see.

05:06.406 --> 05:09.978
Glass, Glass. Drew, is it?

05:10.078 --> 05:11.828
Of course it is.

05:16.817 --> 05:20.855
- What is this, am I being charged?
- We'll get to that when we get there.

05:20.955 --> 05:24.258
Now, you are, in fact, Mr. Glass, I presume?

05:24.358 --> 05:27.295
- Yeah.
- See, how hard was that?

05:27.395 --> 05:31.698
And you are Mr. Glass of September, 1984.

05:31.798 --> 05:35.555
- Yeah.
- Born to Veronica Black.

05:36.069 --> 05:40.089
Deceased, December of 1985. Correct?

05:41.808 --> 05:43.693
Father unknown.

05:44.211 --> 05:47.296
Assumed and adopted by one...

05:48.415 --> 05:51.185
...Lawrence Fitzgerald Glass.

05:51.285 --> 05:53.005
What is this about?

05:53.655 --> 05:56.925
We'll get to that, I promise.

05:57.025 --> 06:00.728
Just answer as I ask.

06:00.828 --> 06:04.481
However trivial or menial it may sound.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.401
So?

06:06.501 --> 06:08.084
So.

06:09.436 --> 06:11.538
Am I being charged?

06:11.639 --> 06:16.228
Oh, well, let me explain to you
what it is exactly that I do.

06:16.778 --> 06:20.262
I'm a glorified buffer of sorts.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.933
A bag man in my previous life.

06:24.384 --> 06:28.723
The reason I do what I do,
and the man in charge chose me...

06:28.823 --> 06:33.509
...is because I have the impeccable
ability to remain...

06:33.827 --> 06:36.564
...non-partisan and unwavering...

06:36.664 --> 06:39.148
...while retaining...

06:39.700 --> 06:42.236
...the relevant amount of empathy...

06:42.336 --> 06:44.806
...it takes to sit across this table.

06:45.306 --> 06:47.809
Now, we're gonna cover a lot
of ground in a short period of time.

06:47.909 --> 06:52.983
So, we will start small and simple and
follow all the splinters as they surface.

06:53.614 --> 06:56.603
So, I need you to tell me how you got here.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.869
What happened?

07:01.788 --> 07:03.659
I'm not exactly sure.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.763
Too much too soon, huh?

07:08.763 --> 07:10.765
Okay, what about the previous day?

07:11.425 --> 07:13.201
Where did that begin?

07:13.301 --> 07:16.104
A blow job? A cup of coffee?

07:16.204 --> 07:20.174
Suduko? It doesn't have
to be significant or profound...

07:20.274 --> 07:22.553
...we're just tryin' to find a beginning.

07:25.278 --> 07:29.083
Nine times out of 10,
these things start with a car ride.

07:29.183 --> 07:32.619
- Or a woman.
- It started with both.

07:34.354 --> 07:35.605
Proceed.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.343
Tell me about the girl.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.464
What the hell is goin' on, man?

08:16.164 --> 08:18.399
Why you takin' a fuckin' attitude with me?

08:18.499 --> 08:22.136
Don't forget I took my night off to drive
the fuck out here to bum fuck nowhere.

08:22.236 --> 08:24.439
Would you give it a fuckin' break?

08:25.289 --> 08:27.108
You know I don't wanna
be doin' this shit either?

08:27.208 --> 08:29.477
Thought you was gonna talk to him first.

08:29.577 --> 08:32.397
I thought about it, what's the point?

08:32.947 --> 08:34.798
What did Larry say?

08:35.399 --> 08:37.485
I'd say we're doin' him a favor.

08:37.585 --> 08:40.619
And now that we're out here,
I just think it's better this way.

08:42.289 --> 08:45.026
You thought things were fucked up
before, shit's only gotten worse.

08:45.126 --> 08:47.261
You ain't gotta church it up for me, man.

08:47.361 --> 08:50.634
You waste Drew,
and your debt with LG is done.

08:53.667 --> 08:55.904
How the fuck you plan on doin' this?

08:56.704 --> 09:00.824
- We pull off in that fuckin' reservoir.
- Do you even have a piece?

09:02.559 --> 09:05.044
- Under the seat.
- Jesus.

09:07.647 --> 09:10.284
And you just decided to tell me this?

09:10.384 --> 09:13.154
Well, don't waste time bein' all sentimental.

09:13.254 --> 09:16.272
Just watch your fuckin' mouth.

10:15.950 --> 10:18.052
Come here, you son of a bitch.

10:18.152 --> 10:20.003
It's been too long.

10:21.424 --> 10:24.759
- Six years.
- Way too long.

10:24.859 --> 10:26.709
How do I look?

10:27.494 --> 10:28.845
Grown.

10:31.623 --> 10:33.301
How was your flight?

10:33.401 --> 10:35.603
Not too bad. A little tight.

10:35.703 --> 10:39.373
Only motherfucker I knew
who charters a fuckin' prop plane.

10:39.473 --> 10:42.076
- Hey, let me get a hit off that bottle.
- Hey, hold your shit.

10:42.176 --> 10:44.345
Where's your manners at?

10:44.445 --> 10:48.616
- You want a Christmas, Drewby?
- Nah, I'm good, man. I gave it up.

10:48.716 --> 10:51.285
- Gave it all up.
- You serious?

10:51.385 --> 10:53.654
Had too, man. The shit was killin' me.

10:53.754 --> 10:56.490
You tellin' me with the genes you got
that don't add up, man.

10:56.590 --> 11:00.194
You're tellin' me you quit shootin' dope and
you can't even have a drink with your friends?

11:00.294 --> 11:02.363
I'm proud of you, man.

11:02.463 --> 11:06.346
I'm serious. I know how hard it is
to quit that shit. It's fuckin' brutal.

11:06.446 --> 11:09.237
Especially with that shit
LG's puttin' out on the streets.

11:09.337 --> 11:11.539
It's got the whole damn town hooked.

11:11.639 --> 11:14.342
Hope you weren't expectin' to come back
and find things cleaned up, man.

11:14.442 --> 11:17.245
They oughta blow this motherfucker
off the map.

11:17.345 --> 11:19.480
I'm not expecting much.

11:19.580 --> 11:22.266
Been gone too long to have any expectations.

11:25.385 --> 11:28.623
I seen Junebug around town. She been around.

11:29.323 --> 11:31.207
How is she?

11:31.525 --> 11:35.062
She sure as hell ain't clean and sober
like you are, I can tell you that.

11:35.162 --> 11:39.251
But she don't go far. Larry's got her
hooked so she don't wander.

11:40.301 --> 11:42.964
I didn't want you to hear like this, but...

11:43.504 --> 11:45.439
...it's not so good.

11:45.539 --> 11:48.873
Wow. If I knew what would happen when I left.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.173
Hondo!

12:19.423 --> 12:21.459
Hondo, wake the fuck up, man!

12:31.618 --> 12:35.263
You got a lot of nerve, little birdie,
comin' out here orderin' me around.

12:37.424 --> 12:41.244
You're more liable to catch buckshot
out here than any kind of help.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.443
I can tell you fiendin'.

12:47.834 --> 12:52.236
You must be, comin' all the way out here,
raisin' hell among us common folk.

12:53.274 --> 12:55.076
What the fuck you thinkin'?

12:55.576 --> 12:59.254
I know that Jew daddy of yours
taught you some kind of manners.

13:01.881 --> 13:04.886
I know that Dreidel Spinner
taught you that much.

13:04.986 --> 13:08.055
- Can't we just fuckin' talk inside?
- We can talk right here!

13:08.155 --> 13:11.592
These my people,
and you're fuckin' up their shit.

13:11.692 --> 13:13.962
They're all tryin' to get their fix too.

13:14.662 --> 13:17.747
And they here day in and day out.

13:18.651 --> 13:21.457
Why I drop my shit and cater to you?

13:22.769 --> 13:24.980
Hondo, fuckin' please, man.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.410
- Just please let me fucking...
- See, little birdie...

13:29.510 --> 13:31.995
...this is why I don't like you and yours.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.197
Y'all...

13:35.882 --> 13:37.767
...got this air.

13:46.191 --> 13:47.730
Entitlement.

13:48.895 --> 13:50.981
It makes me fuckin' sick.

13:55.552 --> 13:57.647
Think you better than the rest of us?

14:03.810 --> 14:05.911
I'm a reasonable man, though.

14:06.780 --> 14:09.017
I'ma listen to what you got to say.

14:10.551 --> 14:12.635
But if it don't benefit me...

14:14.087 --> 14:18.563
...I'll cut that cunny out your crotch
and snail mail it back to your daddy.

14:21.427 --> 14:23.511
Get the fuck in the trailer.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.894
Look at me.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.290
I loved you, man.

15:46.359 --> 15:48.209
Morning, Father.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.103
Mr. Glass.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.306
It's nice to hear your voice again.

16:05.832 --> 16:07.902
How have you been keeping up?

16:08.202 --> 16:11.655
You know... just tryin'
to make you look good.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.410
Seems like I caught you all
in the middle of somethin'.

16:16.510 --> 16:19.426
Just preparing for this evening's mass.

16:19.526 --> 16:23.032
- Come in, sit down.
- I'll stand, thanks.

16:24.517 --> 16:28.070
You can see time has been
generous to you, Father Francis.

16:28.756 --> 16:30.573
You've aged well.

16:31.724 --> 16:33.794
Preparing for mass, huh?

16:33.894 --> 16:36.698
Yeah, I remember how that whole shindig goes.

16:38.465 --> 16:40.734
Yes, it's quite a delicate task.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.269
Well, you think after, what's it been?

16:42.369 --> 16:46.440
40 years of doing this. It would become
like second nature to you bead mumblers.

16:46.540 --> 16:49.310
Is there something we can do for you, boy?

16:49.410 --> 16:53.447
Francis. Drew, I'm sorry,
he's in quite a mood today.

16:53.547 --> 16:58.282
Now is there something you came here
to say or can I get back to work?

16:59.285 --> 17:02.757
Okay, I'll tell you what you can do for me.

17:03.357 --> 17:07.194
You can grab that bank roll and that
dope you got under the tabernacle...

17:07.895 --> 17:11.714
...so I can get up out your hair.
Let you get back to your gospel.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.117
Drew.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.806
Larry hasn't given us donations
for a long time.

17:21.541 --> 17:25.609
All these accusations
and innuendos you're making...

17:26.180 --> 17:30.217
...I can assure you are inaccurate
and unappreciated.

17:30.317 --> 17:34.536
You tell me one more lie, Father.

17:35.788 --> 17:39.676
And I will mount you on that crucifix
and let you bleed out your ass.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.834
Now we both know you're no fucking martyr...

17:46.734 --> 17:48.585
...so, do yourself a favor...

17:49.569 --> 17:52.863
...and I can remind you
of how gentle you were with me.

17:56.876 --> 17:59.314
Show the boy to it, Jack.

18:08.721 --> 18:12.193
Go ahead now. What you got to say?

18:13.793 --> 18:15.863
Somethin' got fucked up, okay?

18:15.963 --> 18:18.166
And nobody's holdin', so...

18:19.599 --> 18:23.070
...I know better than to come down
here if it isn't worth your while.

18:23.170 --> 18:26.851
So, I got over a thousand and I just
need enough to get me through...

18:26.951 --> 18:30.043
...like, just the next few days
'til we get back up.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.645
See...

18:31.745 --> 18:33.562
...I was right.

18:34.146 --> 18:35.998
I knew you was itchin'.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.902
Well, you know I got it.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.512
Got plenty of it.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.309
But your money ain't no good here.

18:47.994 --> 18:50.136
Take a look out that window.

18:51.497 --> 18:53.334
You seen my people's.

18:54.034 --> 18:56.692
Every one of those sad fucks outside...

18:57.237 --> 18:59.160
...more loyal to me...

18:59.260 --> 19:02.558
...than they are to their spouse
or their preacher.

19:02.942 --> 19:04.980
Because this shit right here...

19:05.880 --> 19:10.100
...got a grip on 'em tighter
than a cunt or crucifix.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.602
What can I do?

19:16.155 --> 19:18.040
Just fucking tell me.

19:20.059 --> 19:22.077
What can you do?

19:23.593 --> 19:25.114
Why...

19:25.681 --> 19:28.334
...don't you try that again...

19:28.434 --> 19:30.719
...all sexy like for me?

19:37.643 --> 19:40.662
What can I do?

19:45.618 --> 19:47.169
Hmm.

19:49.155 --> 19:51.374
My dick didn't even hiccup at that.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.029
But don't trip, birdie.

19:55.929 --> 19:58.992
I wouldn't let you smoke this pole anyhow.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.551
You ain't my type.

20:03.035 --> 20:05.039
And, like I said...

20:05.439 --> 20:08.457
...I don't fall for any breed of beef.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.463
I tell you what, though.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.866
You got balls comin' out here.

20:18.184 --> 20:21.870
And for that, I'll deal with you.

20:23.272 --> 20:25.161
But I don't want your money.

20:27.093 --> 20:28.930
Come with me.

21:26.856 --> 21:28.303
Come on.

21:35.462 --> 21:38.832
Just come sit here for a minute, alright?
I need to talk to Grace.

21:38.932 --> 21:41.168
What's goin' on? Who's the little one?

21:41.268 --> 21:43.090
Just come in here.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.175
Is that the girl?

21:49.476 --> 21:51.879
- Hondo had her.
- Hondo, Darla's ex?

21:51.979 --> 21:53.914
What the hell were you doing with him?

21:54.014 --> 21:56.617
Someone knocked off all our shit
that came in this mornin'.

21:56.717 --> 21:58.986
I've been so fuckin' sick, so I went...

21:59.386 --> 22:02.974
...I went down there. He was gonna
bury me if I didn't take her with me.

22:04.058 --> 22:06.894
Can you watch her for a couple of hours while
I figure out what I'm gonna do with her?

22:06.994 --> 22:09.163
- Sure.
- Okay.

22:09.263 --> 22:13.000
- Are you gonna be alright?
- Yeah, it just shook me up. He had her...

22:13.100 --> 22:16.603
...he had her tied up in a fucking shed.
It must've been, like, 100 degrees in there.

22:16.703 --> 22:19.053
Lord knows what he's been doin' to her.

22:30.149 --> 22:31.700
Blow.

22:39.926 --> 22:42.329
I'm sorry. Take care of your business.

22:42.429 --> 22:45.666
I'll get her fed, okay.
She's safe here, Mama, so, don't worry.

22:45.766 --> 22:48.261
Just go out take care of what you gotta do.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.456
You hungry?

22:54.807 --> 22:56.325
Hmm?

22:58.427 --> 23:01.647
Got some fish sticks I can heat up
for you, how's that sound?

23:02.582 --> 23:05.085
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Roonie.

23:05.185 --> 23:08.822
Roonie? I've never met anyone
with that name before.

23:08.922 --> 23:12.059
- You're adorable, you know that?
- Hey, you got the money for lam?

23:12.159 --> 23:14.178
Yeah, it's in the bedside table.

23:17.997 --> 23:22.171
Listen, I gotta go do some big girl things.
But I'll be back in a few hours, okay?

23:22.837 --> 23:25.839
Listen, nothing's gonna happen to you now.

23:26.690 --> 23:31.827
You're safe here. And Grace can
take really good care of you, okay?

23:33.480 --> 23:36.579
When I come back,
maybe we'll go get some ice cream.

23:37.084 --> 23:38.934
That sound good?

23:40.186 --> 23:42.004
I'll see you soon.

23:43.523 --> 23:45.793
I don't care who comes to the door,
don't let anyone inside.

23:45.893 --> 23:47.594
I got you, are you gonna be okay?

23:47.694 --> 23:50.130
Yeah, I just gotta figure out
what in the hell I'm gonna do with her.

23:50.230 --> 23:53.083
- Be careful.
- Alright, I'll see you soon.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.165
You got yourself a little boat.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.789
- You do?
- I like that catfish.

24:48.889 --> 24:52.225
Yeah, well, who don't like fresh catfish?

24:52.325 --> 24:54.596
Oh, you're a bottom feeder, huh?

24:56.496 --> 24:59.800
That's my world, your's too.

24:59.900 --> 25:03.103
- Yes, sir.
- Gotta like 'em. I like beans, man.

25:03.203 --> 25:07.875
I like beans, catfish, cole slaw.
Jesus, I love cookin' beans.

25:07.975 --> 25:10.141
Put a little a that soul sauce on there too?

25:11.811 --> 25:14.631
Oh, here she is. Come on, sugar.

25:22.121 --> 25:23.924
How you feel today?

25:24.224 --> 25:26.260
This is daddy's little dove.

25:27.160 --> 25:29.579
Never a day or a dollar short.

25:30.663 --> 25:33.701
Look at you, a well oiled machine.

25:34.201 --> 25:37.009
There's efficiency,
ain't that right, baby, huh?

25:38.971 --> 25:40.990
How old are you, sweetheart?

25:43.509 --> 25:45.060
23.

25:46.712 --> 25:48.949
Goddamn, you look good.

25:49.049 --> 25:50.569
Hey...

25:50.912 --> 25:52.662
...I see those gears grindin'.

25:52.853 --> 25:55.856
She ain't like the others.
It's my Clydesdale.

25:55.956 --> 25:59.040
Breeder. My seabiscuit.

26:00.993 --> 26:02.812
I raised her myself.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.666
What was that, the usual?

26:06.766 --> 26:08.335
Mm-hmm.

26:08.435 --> 26:10.571
Good girl, huh, what do you want?

26:10.671 --> 26:12.673
Mister, sir, uh...

26:13.273 --> 26:15.842
...the phone is for you.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.844
Take a message.

26:17.944 --> 26:20.404
<i>Pero... pero</i>, she's crying.

26:20.504 --> 26:23.527
- Who? Who?
- The woman. The woman...

26:23.627 --> 26:27.320
- ...she's crazy. I can't understand her.
- Jesus Christ. Christ!

26:27.420 --> 26:30.357
Go on, what the hell I pay you for?

26:30.457 --> 26:32.274
I'll be right back.

26:33.225 --> 26:34.776
Huh?

26:37.062 --> 26:39.833
Goddamn, you got a nice lookin' ass.

26:39.933 --> 26:41.768
What are you gonna do with that?

26:41.868 --> 26:45.114
I don't know. What do you want me to do?

27:29.882 --> 27:33.453
Are you a freak? I can tell a freak any time.

27:33.553 --> 27:35.439
A mile long.

27:43.796 --> 27:45.666
Where'd you come from?

27:45.966 --> 27:48.636
Just made the pick up and then I came over.

27:50.136 --> 27:52.020
Anything unusual?

27:55.674 --> 27:57.926
No, what do you mean?

28:01.914 --> 28:06.138
I gotta go, Ronny.
I'll back to you on them licenses.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.304
And, uh...

28:10.089 --> 28:11.940
...and you...

28:12.391 --> 28:14.393
...if anything...

28:14.493 --> 28:17.503
...like an emergency happens
while I'm gone...

28:18.530 --> 28:20.782
...you'll call me, right?

28:22.468 --> 28:24.019
Mm-hmm.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.794
I'll see ya.

28:40.035 --> 28:42.078
Well, now Daddy's gone.

28:42.555 --> 28:44.454
Why don't you...

28:45.087 --> 28:49.312
...bring that on around here and let me
toss it up and play with it a little bit.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.186
Forgive me, son, but I asked about the girl.

29:13.286 --> 29:16.319
Now all of this is fascinating.

29:17.689 --> 29:20.110
We need to get to where you come into play.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.650
What is it that you're after, exactly?

30:13.312 --> 30:15.409
This here's a wildflower.

30:17.683 --> 30:19.705
It ain't nothin' special but...

30:23.456 --> 30:25.006
Hey.

30:25.892 --> 30:29.163
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- What you want, mister?

30:29.763 --> 30:31.613
How are you today?

30:32.631 --> 30:34.989
Don't worry about how I is,
what you doin' out here?

30:37.170 --> 30:39.440
I'm lookin' for a man named Pope.

30:40.140 --> 30:42.375
You say you lookin' for a Pope?

30:42.475 --> 30:46.046
No, a man named Pope,
used to live around here.

30:46.146 --> 30:48.408
Mister, you know who Pope is?

30:49.182 --> 30:50.884
Yeah, I do...

30:50.984 --> 30:53.603
...I've known Pope
longer than you been alive.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.738
- Is that right?
- That's right.

30:57.122 --> 30:59.175
I can't help ya, I'm sorry.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.996
I got a hundred dollars.

31:03.596 --> 31:06.008
Anybody might lead me to him.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.974
Hey, squirt, you stay right here, alright?

31:14.824 --> 31:17.007
Now you say what now?

31:17.377 --> 31:21.019
I say I got a hundred dollars
to anybody who take me to Pope.

31:22.015 --> 31:23.717
Tell ya what...

31:23.817 --> 31:28.269
...you keep that Benjamin,
you come out here lookin' all slick like...

31:28.821 --> 31:31.909
...look like the kinda guy might know
where to find a bag of ice.

31:33.359 --> 31:37.013
Yeah, I might be able to help you with that.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.164
Here what we gonna do.

31:41.133 --> 31:43.136
Ol' squirt back there, he got a boat.

31:43.236 --> 31:45.672
He gonna take ya a quarter mile up the river.

31:45.772 --> 31:48.642
I ain't gettin' in that boat
'cause I'm scared of skins.

31:48.742 --> 31:50.544
But here's the deal...

31:51.044 --> 31:53.981
...I'm gonna hold me end,
you hold yours. You don't...

31:54.181 --> 31:56.750
...I'm gonna string ya up like a southern
wind chime. Ya understand?

31:56.850 --> 31:59.272
You gonna be happy
with what I got for you, boy.

31:59.372 --> 32:03.089
I'll be the judge of that.
Alright, hey, squirt...

32:03.189 --> 32:05.416
...you gonna hop in with this man here...

32:06.252 --> 32:08.529
...he gonna take ya up the river, alright?

32:10.230 --> 32:12.899
You're gonna be alright, alright.

32:21.174 --> 32:24.077
Is this somethin'
I should have an attorney for?

32:24.177 --> 32:25.979
What are you guilty of?

32:26.279 --> 32:28.781
Again, I apologize
for the implication format...

32:28.881 --> 32:33.569
...but usually when one requests
representation it's an admission of guilt.

32:35.221 --> 32:38.436
Now we can go down that avenue but...

32:39.291 --> 32:41.794
...there's a mess here.

32:41.894 --> 32:44.538
And although there are other subjects...

32:44.638 --> 32:49.436
...who are most certainly involved, you, in
fact, are the only one they brought to me.

32:49.536 --> 32:53.832
Not anyone else. I can assure you
forfeiting this opportunity...

32:53.932 --> 32:56.306
...would be something to regret...

32:56.406 --> 33:01.329
...as there won't be another opportunity
for reprieve, understood?

33:02.881 --> 33:04.766
I think I do.

33:05.784 --> 33:07.636
So what will it be?

33:09.204 --> 33:11.022
Are we done?

33:13.859 --> 33:15.710
Very well.

33:19.131 --> 33:20.682
Wait.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.301
Fuck it.

34:14.654 --> 34:16.504
This it?

34:19.824 --> 34:21.376
Shit.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.648
Don't go nowhere.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.251
I mean...

34:30.969 --> 34:34.422
...don't you go nowhere, I'll be back.

34:38.043 --> 34:40.411
Up there, huh?

34:40.512 --> 34:42.063
Shit.

34:47.119 --> 34:48.670
Hello?

34:51.456 --> 34:53.007
Pope?

35:13.879 --> 35:15.465
Shit.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.901
Hey, how long has it been?

35:22.354 --> 35:24.638
February '92.

35:27.359 --> 35:29.965
I don't know how the fuck you remember that.

35:36.502 --> 35:38.353
How are ya?

35:39.271 --> 35:41.308
The fuck does it look like I am?

35:42.976 --> 35:47.863
I don't deserve a little chit-chat? I mean,
I just drove in a car for about an hour...

35:47.963 --> 35:52.965
...got stuck in a boat with a mute
and nearly killed myself walkin' up here.

35:53.786 --> 35:55.603
Then well...

35:56.421 --> 35:59.091
...why don't you get
to the point why you're here.

36:01.094 --> 36:03.911
It's... it's my son.

36:04.563 --> 36:06.414
Remember him?

36:06.632 --> 36:08.839
Yeah, the one you adopted.

36:09.269 --> 36:11.167
That's it.

36:11.506 --> 36:13.596
Well, he's gone off the rails.

36:14.906 --> 36:17.343
Gotta Jihadist agenda...

36:18.199 --> 36:20.247
...and he's just hurt me in...

36:21.680 --> 36:25.134
...just hurt me in ways
that I can't forgive him.

36:26.218 --> 36:29.356
I don't really know how to say this, but...

36:29.456 --> 36:31.507
So you want me to put him down?

36:35.060 --> 36:37.148
I like the way you say that.

36:39.765 --> 36:42.218
Well, it's gonna be double for family.

36:49.608 --> 36:50.989
Double?

36:53.279 --> 36:55.697
Did I stutter? I said double.

36:58.817 --> 37:01.692
Thing about it is I need it done yesterday.

37:10.629 --> 37:13.240
Well, that's why you came
to me, isn't it, then?

37:15.346 --> 37:19.385
Alright, no, that's alright,
I'll just... okay.

37:19.485 --> 37:21.356
Just let me know.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.559
Let me know.

37:30.249 --> 37:31.800
Smoke?

37:32.317 --> 37:33.868
Please.

37:51.904 --> 37:53.788
So what else?

37:55.707 --> 37:59.946
Yes, well, says here that you have an uncle.

38:00.046 --> 38:01.848
Was he related to your mother?

38:02.348 --> 38:03.898
Yeah.

38:04.183 --> 38:05.493
A...

38:05.978 --> 38:07.920
...Marvin Crenshaw Glass.

38:08.020 --> 38:09.904
Marvin, yeah.

38:46.326 --> 38:48.607
I had a felling you'd still be here.

38:51.062 --> 38:53.970
I never move, boy, you know better than that.

38:55.735 --> 38:57.585
What happened?

38:59.371 --> 39:01.812
Never mind, I'll tell you about it later.

39:05.011 --> 39:06.861
What's in the cup?

39:08.880 --> 39:10.358
Green tea.

39:11.550 --> 39:13.367
Green tea?

39:13.752 --> 39:16.223
What, man, you go queer on me?

39:16.923 --> 39:18.740
Alright, gimme a swig.

39:25.564 --> 39:28.974
Man, just when I thought I couldn't draw one.

39:30.503 --> 39:34.107
Thought you'd appreciate that pay off
the house and maybe the car payment.

39:34.207 --> 39:37.961
Oh, boy, you been gone a minute,
fuck the car and the house.

39:50.056 --> 39:51.572
Sorry.

40:09.690 --> 40:11.276
Shit.

40:15.814 --> 40:17.684
It's all bullshit, man.

40:18.384 --> 40:20.428
Just leave the chair out here. Come on.

40:20.528 --> 40:22.350
I'm not even gonna ask.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.299
Come on.

40:42.207 --> 40:44.456
Here's for your troubles, Marv.

40:55.353 --> 40:58.605
You are a saint, boy.

41:01.027 --> 41:03.062
So what happened, man, you okay?

41:03.162 --> 41:04.712
Yeah.

41:05.430 --> 41:09.236
Don't overdue it now,
you're the only blood I got left.

41:09.936 --> 41:12.571
You know I hate to spoil you
but it feels right.

41:12.671 --> 41:15.476
Oh, boy, I been in the game a while.

41:16.408 --> 41:20.671
Big man would've punched out my ticket
long time ago if he's goin' to.

41:22.881 --> 41:25.903
Don't take bein' a dope fiend
to fell like that.

41:26.986 --> 41:28.870
What brings you around?

41:29.888 --> 41:33.293
Filin' this under vacation time or somethin'?

41:34.393 --> 41:36.328
You could call it that.

41:36.428 --> 41:38.831
I got some evils of my own to clear out.

41:38.931 --> 41:41.583
Some business to insure pleasure.

41:42.734 --> 41:44.637
Just the trash man this time.

41:44.737 --> 41:48.140
You know where a trash man
finds himself at the end of his day?

41:48.240 --> 41:50.124
Where's that?

41:51.142 --> 41:55.548
Standin' alone, right in front
of the pile of crap he's collected...

41:56.198 --> 41:58.000
...covered in shit.

42:00.086 --> 42:03.089
I suspect I'll be covered
from head to toe when I'm done.

42:03.189 --> 42:06.206
Alright, I'm sure you will be.

42:23.341 --> 42:25.792
Oh, yeah, yeah.

42:26.577 --> 42:29.515
That fuckin' keich that raised ya.

42:29.615 --> 42:31.431
Easy, Marv.

42:31.799 --> 42:33.835
Don't fall out of that high now.

42:35.620 --> 42:39.235
Man shouldn't be allowed
to live like that and...

42:40.859 --> 42:43.030
...not taste hell for it.

42:56.507 --> 43:00.194
A man's gotta have a code, yeah.

43:01.079 --> 43:03.515
Or what else, what kinda man is he?

43:03.615 --> 43:05.317
What d'ya think I came back?

43:05.417 --> 43:10.075
Make good with all the folks I've taken from,
and taken from me, start over?

43:10.856 --> 43:12.406
Nah.

43:13.458 --> 43:15.661
I came back to say my piece.

43:15.861 --> 43:18.130
Get some much needed sleep.

43:22.866 --> 43:26.087
The one thing I learned is that you...

43:27.038 --> 43:31.477
...you don't have to be six feet under
to be cycled out of existence.

43:35.380 --> 43:40.019
Oh, the truth is that I've been wanderin'
this earth without a soul for years.

43:40.119 --> 43:45.599
And the only sense that I can make out
of the extent of my existence is this...

43:47.892 --> 43:51.546
Is this some sort of fucked up
punishment for my failure to live?

43:52.430 --> 43:55.467
When I go, and I pray God, I hope it's soon.

43:55.567 --> 43:57.407
But when it happens...

43:57.990 --> 43:59.810
...if I'm lucky...

44:01.639 --> 44:05.264
...it'll be with a needle
in my arm or at my side.

44:06.212 --> 44:08.665
Just a comfortable compromise.

44:11.416 --> 44:13.466
Don't be like me.

44:16.787 --> 44:19.406
Ahh, when you cross over...

44:21.526 --> 44:25.161
...boy, you make sure you got
some truth to put on the table.

44:27.632 --> 44:30.309
Or heaven's gonna burn your eyes.

44:33.505 --> 44:35.055
Yeah.

45:25.490 --> 45:27.066
Yeah.

45:27.659 --> 45:29.228
Oh.

45:29.428 --> 45:31.263
Take a seat.

45:31.363 --> 45:34.447
Hey, you know, Jer,
I'm gonna have to call you back later.

45:46.577 --> 45:48.629
Well, well, well.

45:49.280 --> 45:51.131
The prodigal son.

45:52.250 --> 45:54.135
How the hell are ya?

45:55.286 --> 45:56.687
Good.

45:58.723 --> 46:00.737
So maybe we just...

46:01.260 --> 46:03.385
...oughta cut the bullshit, huh?

46:03.485 --> 46:06.152
Quit actin' so excited to see each other.

46:06.632 --> 46:09.635
Head penguin over
at St. Vincent's, she called me.

46:09.735 --> 46:12.171
Just to let me know that you were in town.

46:13.071 --> 46:16.659
And before you cum all over
yourself tryin' to explain...

46:17.009 --> 46:21.334
...let me just say that I'm very aware
of that special relationship you had...

46:21.434 --> 46:23.565
...with Jackie and Uncle Frank.

46:27.285 --> 46:29.136
But I...

46:30.688 --> 46:33.773
...I do indeed need to insist...

46:36.360 --> 46:39.113
...that I get back what is mine.

46:39.798 --> 46:42.189
There's more then just my mouth...

46:42.289 --> 46:44.643
...that relies on what you took...

46:44.743 --> 46:47.955
...so why don't you
just get to what you want?

46:48.273 --> 46:51.777
- We can let bygones be.
- Just like that?

46:51.877 --> 46:54.364
Well, hell ya, just like that.

47:00.451 --> 47:02.503
And if I don't?

47:04.555 --> 47:06.406
My God, son.

47:07.695 --> 47:10.924
You know when they talk
about a thorn in your side?

47:12.497 --> 47:14.533
That's what you are to me.

47:16.834 --> 47:18.871
So what're we gonna do, boys?

47:19.471 --> 47:22.478
What are we gonna do
about ol' sporto here, huh?

47:27.278 --> 47:29.485
Why don't I make it easy on ya?

47:36.354 --> 47:38.238
Look at that.

47:43.594 --> 47:45.646
I will guarantee...

47:46.931 --> 47:50.390
...that this little treasure
will remain intact...

47:50.490 --> 47:52.969
...if we can just work out a compromise.

47:57.241 --> 48:00.873
What's it say on there? Oh, to my daddy.

48:01.480 --> 48:04.561
Love, little Junebug. God.

48:15.660 --> 48:17.210
That's...

48:17.462 --> 48:19.947
- Settle down.
- That's...

48:20.814 --> 48:22.265
No!

48:22.667 --> 48:25.152
No! No!

48:28.140 --> 48:31.201
Let me know if that brings back
any memories for you.

48:46.758 --> 48:48.827
Just take that right there.

49:16.487 --> 49:18.572
Well, get up.

49:23.561 --> 49:25.412
Get up.

49:37.275 --> 49:39.159
Pull your pants up.

49:48.386 --> 49:50.838
Come on now, get on up.

49:54.893 --> 49:58.229
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Pedro just mopped in here.

50:01.299 --> 50:03.843
You can walk around...

50:05.035 --> 50:08.907
...and act like you went out in the world...

50:09.007 --> 50:11.425
...and made somethin' of yourself.

50:12.276 --> 50:15.065
But if you think for a fuckin' second...

50:15.165 --> 50:18.368
...that you could come in here
and take what is mine...

50:18.784 --> 50:20.802
...you got another thought comin'.

50:25.423 --> 50:28.400
When that fuckin' junkbox mother of yours...

50:28.500 --> 50:30.930
...topped herself off, who...

50:31.430 --> 50:33.701
...who brought you in? Who took care of you?

50:33.801 --> 50:36.096
Who fuckin' loved you?

50:36.602 --> 50:38.418
You and Junebug.

50:40.671 --> 50:43.100
And I know you come here with a mission.

50:44.509 --> 50:47.151
On the warpath with fire in your eyes.

50:48.213 --> 50:50.640
Let me tell you right now...

50:50.740 --> 50:53.035
...what you come here to save...

50:53.135 --> 50:56.002
...is dead and gone, boy.

50:59.257 --> 51:01.939
You have my shit here tonight!

51:05.462 --> 51:07.281
And I'll let you both live.

51:07.932 --> 51:10.817
How 'bout that, huh?

51:11.569 --> 51:13.872
How 'bout that, do we understand each other?

51:13.972 --> 51:16.441
Do we understand each other?

51:18.342 --> 51:19.892
Huh?

51:21.445 --> 51:23.731
Now get the fuck out of my office.

51:31.189 --> 51:33.830
You two, both of you,
get the fuck out of here!

52:40.257 --> 52:42.076
Where's the boy?

52:44.228 --> 52:47.080
This is you and me.

52:49.867 --> 52:51.418
Okay.

52:52.970 --> 52:54.488
Cigarette?

52:56.374 --> 52:57.925
Obliged.

53:10.287 --> 53:12.175
'Preciate it.

53:53.164 --> 53:55.035
What did she say about me?

53:56.485 --> 53:59.169
The woman is such a bitch.

54:09.880 --> 54:11.431
Crap.

54:12.182 --> 54:14.035
My life...

54:17.855 --> 54:21.778
Uh, Deidreth, yeah, I gotta call you back.

54:22.392 --> 54:24.679
Yeah, I'll have her there by 6 o'clock.

54:25.863 --> 54:27.433
Hey.

54:28.133 --> 54:30.950
- Hey.
- Look who the fuck it is.

54:31.570 --> 54:33.575
I thought you were dead by now.

54:34.873 --> 54:38.910
You know, Taylor should be home
any minute. She's in the first grade now.

54:39.010 --> 54:43.113
Yeah, they got her in one of those
immersion programs. She's learnin' French.

54:44.915 --> 54:48.579
You want anything, baby, like coffee, or...

54:49.120 --> 54:50.570
No.

54:51.555 --> 54:53.458
You seen Raymond yet?

54:53.558 --> 54:56.645
I actually came by
to surprise him, is he around?

54:57.629 --> 55:00.265
He's here, got himself a legitimate business.

55:00.365 --> 55:04.435
- A regular entrepreneur...
- I'll let him elaborate.

55:05.170 --> 55:07.649
Call me Sergeant.
Call me Sergeant Peppercock.

55:07.749 --> 55:09.308
Okay, Peppercock.

55:09.408 --> 55:12.463
- Yes, give it to me, yes.
- Where's the salsa?

55:18.983 --> 55:20.568
Libby?

55:24.355 --> 55:26.774
Libby, what the fuck?

55:30.427 --> 55:34.279
What the fuck? Did Libby not
tell you we're shootin' in here?

55:34.379 --> 55:36.635
She mentioned you were
a small business owner.

55:36.735 --> 55:40.521
She didn't say anything about you being
the second coming of Johnny Watt.

55:42.172 --> 55:43.723
Yeah?

55:44.742 --> 55:47.034
Well, how'd I look, you peppin' faggot?

55:47.446 --> 55:50.148
Use your hips more,
it's not just about stabbin' her.

55:50.248 --> 55:53.298
Come on, baby, who the fuck is it?

55:53.518 --> 55:55.191
It's just a ghost, sweetie.

55:56.121 --> 55:59.416
- This a bad time?
- It's always a bad time.

55:59.516 --> 56:01.374
Come on in.

56:02.793 --> 56:06.765
Just ignore the bitch, she's out of her mind.

56:06.865 --> 56:09.868
Baby, hang tight for me alright,
we'll finish up in a minute.

56:09.968 --> 56:12.211
Are you Dirk Diggler nowaday?

56:14.472 --> 56:17.041
If you only knew the market
in Internet porn, brother...

56:17.141 --> 56:20.545
...you'd be jockin' that tube steak
in front of the camera your damn self.

56:20.645 --> 56:25.083
- Business is good?
- It's boomin', you got no idea.

56:25.183 --> 56:28.453
Best move I ever made
was employing my own cock, man.

56:28.553 --> 56:31.029
I mean, fuck chasin' dope fiends...

56:31.129 --> 56:35.448
...this is like shootin' fish
in a barrel, but with dynamite.

56:36.026 --> 56:40.791
Well, it's good to hear you got your shit
all worked out. Wouldn't expect any less.

56:42.332 --> 56:45.204
Actually came by to check
your interest on somethin'.

56:46.504 --> 56:50.109
Well, I wouldn't expect any less
from you neither, Drewbee.

56:50.750 --> 56:53.827
I've never known you
not to be workin' somethin'.

56:55.180 --> 56:57.618
I'm guessing you saw the Jew already.

56:59.616 --> 57:01.468
Yeah, I ran into him.

57:05.289 --> 57:06.806
Alright.

57:08.992 --> 57:10.878
Wait for me outside.

57:11.595 --> 57:13.403
I gotta get some...

57:14.206 --> 57:15.578
...pants on.

57:26.644 --> 57:28.658
Let me get one of them smokes.

57:44.895 --> 57:47.374
Paid a visit to our friends this mornin'.

57:48.933 --> 57:50.735
Diaper Snipers?

57:50.835 --> 57:52.385
Yeah.

57:54.838 --> 57:56.689
Got a little out of hand.

57:58.308 --> 58:00.244
Shit, man.

58:00.344 --> 58:02.414
I don't even need details.

58:03.264 --> 58:06.293
Those twisted fucks deserve
whatever happened to 'em.

58:07.185 --> 58:09.154
What you need from me?

58:09.254 --> 58:11.071
Just wait by the phone.

58:13.123 --> 58:16.543
This goes the way I see it,
I won't be able to ever come back.

58:17.227 --> 58:20.852
We could get off what's in the guest
room and be good for a while.

58:22.699 --> 58:25.115
I just need to know you're still reliable.

58:26.554 --> 58:30.373
Till death my friend, till death.

58:32.844 --> 58:37.864
Well, you've been around
the block a few times.

58:38.348 --> 58:40.619
Watchin' the world turn to shit.

58:41.219 --> 58:44.038
You know, how do you find the balance?

58:46.290 --> 58:49.294
You see, my grandfather
used to tell me this story...

58:49.394 --> 58:54.046
...about a war within his mind
between two wolves.

58:55.165 --> 58:59.169
Now he said one wolf represented anger...

58:59.269 --> 59:00.787
...superiority...

59:01.471 --> 59:02.874
...ego...

59:02.974 --> 59:05.251
...rage, resentment.

59:05.709 --> 59:10.396
Now the other wolf represented benevolence...

59:10.880 --> 59:12.431
...passion...

59:12.716 --> 59:15.601
...peace and kindness.

59:17.621 --> 59:21.660
And then he said to me,
"I see the same war within you".

59:24.196 --> 59:26.413
Well, which wolf wins?

59:27.431 --> 59:31.384
And he said, "what's the one that you feed?"

59:36.506 --> 59:39.125
Shit, that's deep.

59:41.645 --> 59:45.784
You know my father, now he used to say...

59:47.117 --> 59:49.136
...the world's a bitch, son.

59:50.153 --> 59:54.626
As soon as she spreads her legs and you
take a bite of that pie, she owns you...

59:55.726 --> 01:00:00.037
...and if she ever catches you
fuckin' around, not playin' by her rules...

01:00:00.137 --> 01:00:02.533
...she will take everything...

01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:06.470
...and leave your ass out in the cold.

01:00:14.511 --> 01:00:16.732
Some words of wisdom, right?

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:26.035
Well, I can't say I disagree
with that perspective of yours.

01:00:27.524 --> 01:00:29.526
Oh, uh...

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:31.495
...do you mind?

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:40.305
- How's she doin'?
- I got her eatin' chocolate, look at her.

01:00:40.905 --> 01:00:44.591
I got her some clean clothes,
some cookies in the car.

01:00:47.444 --> 01:00:49.180
- She's fed.
- Okay.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:51.903
We cleaned her up and braided her hair.

01:00:52.317 --> 01:00:54.652
She's been sleepin' for an hour
or two, think she needed it.

01:00:54.752 --> 01:00:56.272
Good.

01:01:00.724 --> 01:01:02.995
What do you think he was doin' to her?

01:01:03.995 --> 01:01:05.845
I don't know.

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:12.919
Did anyone come by?

01:01:14.538 --> 01:01:16.004
Drew.

01:01:16.104 --> 01:01:17.991
Drew, which one?

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:20.678
Drew, my Drew?

01:01:20.878 --> 01:01:23.181
- He came by, but...
- He did, what did he say?

01:01:23.281 --> 01:01:26.933
He wants you to meet him
at the diner at four.

01:01:27.618 --> 01:01:29.469
Is that all he said?

01:01:30.587 --> 01:01:31.622
How did he look?

01:01:31.722 --> 01:01:34.725
- He looked good, healthy.
- Yeah.

01:01:34.825 --> 01:01:37.895
He just said to make sure
you're there at four.

01:01:37.995 --> 01:01:40.264
You want me to keep her while you go?

01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:41.914
No.

01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:45.539
I'm responsible for this little one.

01:01:46.039 --> 01:01:48.908
I don't know what I'd do
if anything happened to her.

01:01:50.308 --> 01:01:52.176
What's so funny?

01:01:52.276 --> 01:01:55.213
This little one's givin' you
a case of baby fever.

01:01:55.313 --> 01:01:59.132
I can't help it, look at her. Hey.

01:01:59.349 --> 01:02:02.373
I got you some clean clothes, you wanna see?

01:02:02.687 --> 01:02:03.855
Yeah.

01:02:03.955 --> 01:02:06.737
And I got you some cookies, you still hungry?

01:02:09.026 --> 01:02:10.576
Well...

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:13.846
...you're right.

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:20.505
There's no room in the world
for a decent man anymore.

01:02:20.605 --> 01:02:22.878
Just a bunch of medicated droolers...

01:02:22.978 --> 01:02:26.817
...lookin' to be absolved
by a congregation of suits.

01:02:27.477 --> 01:02:29.896
Boob-tube prophets.

01:02:33.151 --> 01:02:35.234
And in this moment of...

01:02:36.786 --> 01:02:39.802
...divine insight if you can call it that...

01:02:41.591 --> 01:02:45.219
...I don't apologize to anyone
for not participating.

01:02:45.763 --> 01:02:47.815
Wasn't my game to begin with.

01:02:49.366 --> 01:02:52.216
I never injured anyone but myself.

01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:59.533
You cannot lose if you do not play.

01:03:57.133 --> 01:03:59.204
<i>So let me ask you a question.</i>

01:03:59.804 --> 01:04:03.102
Upon your arrival how much
of this did you anticipate?

01:04:03.541 --> 01:04:06.111
Are you asking me if this was premeditated?

01:04:06.911 --> 01:04:08.460
<i>Yes.</i>

01:04:08.878 --> 01:04:13.733
I'd say what was thought out
was always subject to change.

01:04:14.217 --> 01:04:18.089
I mean, a situation like this never
pans out they way you'd expect.

01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:20.793
I hear that a lot in this room.

01:04:22.093 --> 01:04:24.686
I guess what I'm tryin' to say is that...

01:04:24.786 --> 01:04:26.893
...my goal was to stay true to the agenda...

01:04:26.993 --> 01:04:29.869
...and do my best to avoid
any collateral damage.

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:35.139
You know I... I have a thing
about tampering with the innocent.

01:04:35.239 --> 01:04:37.091
Why's that?

01:04:52.156 --> 01:04:54.114
Innocence ain't cheap.

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:28.040
- Can I touch you? Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.659
You look so beautiful.

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.366
So do you, you look good.

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:11.317
Are you ready?

01:06:13.288 --> 01:06:15.300
<i>I can't believe you're real.</i>

01:06:23.747 --> 01:06:25.805
There's someone I want you to meet.

01:06:37.727 --> 01:06:39.998
<i>How 'bout this little girl?</i>

01:06:40.498 --> 01:06:45.558
<i>How did you assume responsibility for her
and what was the obligation in doing so?</i>

01:06:46.504 --> 01:06:48.562
<i>Well, that was all June...</i>

01:06:49.554 --> 01:06:52.730
<i>...but I think she saw something
in Rooney that she identified with...</i>

01:06:52.830 --> 01:06:56.239
<i>...but hadn't seen in herself
since she was a little girl.</i>

01:06:56.614 --> 01:07:00.500
<i>You know something she'd forgotten
but had been searching for.</i>

01:07:01.218 --> 01:07:05.456
<i>Did she think
that the innocence of this child...</i>

01:07:05.556 --> 01:07:07.804
<i>...could wipe both your slates clean?</i>

01:07:08.793 --> 01:07:10.810
<i>Something like that.</i>

01:07:14.481 --> 01:07:17.336
- She's adorable, isn't she?
- Yeah.

01:07:18.236 --> 01:07:22.116
Where'd you find her?
Everybody's looking for that kid.

01:07:22.473 --> 01:07:26.292
Hondy had her locked up in a shed.

01:07:28.011 --> 01:07:31.449
I guess her parents owed
so he did away with them.

01:07:31.549 --> 01:07:33.384
She's lucky you found her.

01:07:34.184 --> 01:07:36.069
What's gonna happen?

01:07:37.587 --> 01:07:39.472
I don't know.

01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:42.718
I think I should keep her.

01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:52.291
You think there's a way to change
the way we've turned out?

01:07:54.604 --> 01:07:56.455
I don't know.

01:07:58.475 --> 01:08:01.812
I spent the last six years
trying to figure that out.

01:08:01.912 --> 01:08:03.948
When I realized I couldn't...

01:08:04.648 --> 01:08:07.058
...I found myself right back here.

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:12.319
Maybe she's what we needed.

01:08:15.593 --> 01:08:17.410
Something to save.

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:23.600
June, we can't even save ourselves.

01:08:25.033 --> 01:08:27.265
I just need to get out of here.

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:30.390
That's why I came, to take you with me.

01:08:31.175 --> 01:08:34.827
I know but... what about her?

01:08:36.045 --> 01:08:38.121
I can't just leave her now...

01:08:39.265 --> 01:08:41.522
...she's got no one that loves her.

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:45.138
Why can't that be us?

01:08:48.357 --> 01:08:50.796
How long are we gonna be here?

01:08:51.161 --> 01:08:53.229
I don't know, babe, why, what's up?

01:08:53.330 --> 01:08:55.180
When can I go home?

01:09:00.737 --> 01:09:02.587
I don't know.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.658
Why?

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:09.621
I don't know, I'm figurin' that out.

01:09:11.915 --> 01:09:13.430
Listen...

01:09:14.270 --> 01:09:16.876
...I need you to be strong for me, okay?

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.872
I need you to be brave.

01:09:25.577 --> 01:09:27.596
I know how you feel.

01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:31.752
When I was little I had to be brave too.

01:09:35.438 --> 01:09:39.403
Somethin' happened to me
between then and now and...

01:09:39.502 --> 01:09:41.727
...and I got lost but...

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:45.304
...I'm not gonna let that happen to you.

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:49.135
I promise, okay?

01:09:50.252 --> 01:09:53.389
You're gonna be okay, come here.

01:09:57.594 --> 01:09:59.445
You're gonna be okay.

01:10:00.763 --> 01:10:03.234
Well, you have to understand
where we came from.

01:10:03.334 --> 01:10:07.086
Where she came from, when I first
met her she was six years old...

01:10:07.186 --> 01:10:10.991
...she was raised overseas.
Her mother was a prostitute, murdered.

01:10:13.076 --> 01:10:16.213
At the time Larry was
gettin' women from there...

01:10:16.313 --> 01:10:20.190
...she came in with one
of the new crops of girls.

01:10:24.287 --> 01:10:27.491
I still remember the first time I saw her.

01:10:28.758 --> 01:10:32.030
She was this little petrified bag of bones.

01:10:32.730 --> 01:10:36.316
Couldn't speak a word of English,
scared of her own shadow.

01:10:38.801 --> 01:10:42.081
<i>That's why when she introduced me to Rooney
I didn't even have to think about it...</i>

01:10:42.182 --> 01:10:44.774
<i>...I knew what June saw
in her even if she didn't.</i>

01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:54.399
Hey, Rooney.

01:10:55.618 --> 01:10:58.672
Listen, I need you to do
something for me, okay?

01:11:00.557 --> 01:11:02.596
We're goin' somewhere that's not that safe...

01:11:02.696 --> 01:11:07.352
...so I need you to just trust me
and come with me for a second, okay?

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:15.339
It's safe in here, you're just wait
and I'll come get you. Okay?

01:11:15.439 --> 01:11:18.175
- You can do it.
- Okay.

01:11:18.275 --> 01:11:19.825
Alright.

01:12:32.616 --> 01:12:35.252
You want me to get your things together?

01:12:35.452 --> 01:12:37.687
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:13:33.542 --> 01:13:35.979
Wanna go somewhere warm or cold?

01:13:36.779 --> 01:13:38.563
You pick, baby.

01:14:21.057 --> 01:14:24.319
- So what... what'd ya pack for?
- What?

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:26.812
Hot or cold?

01:14:28.164 --> 01:14:29.715
Oh.

01:14:30.666 --> 01:14:32.217
Hot.

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:56.542
Give it here.

01:15:16.230 --> 01:15:18.479
I didn't think you remembered.

01:15:19.782 --> 01:15:21.633
It's like ridin' a bike.

01:16:01.391 --> 01:16:02.941
Drew.

01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:06.078
Yes, love?

01:16:08.130 --> 01:16:10.182
Don't ever leave me.

01:16:11.267 --> 01:16:12.818
Never.

01:16:15.504 --> 01:16:17.764
I'm alone without you.

01:16:20.542 --> 01:16:22.992
Don't make me do that again.

01:16:24.413 --> 01:16:26.483
I'm not goin' anywhere.

01:16:35.324 --> 01:16:37.175
Take me to bed.

01:17:15.264 --> 01:17:16.852
What are we gonna do?

01:17:18.202 --> 01:17:20.019
What do you mean?

01:17:21.004 --> 01:17:24.258
I just know this isn't gonna
play out the way we want.

01:17:26.375 --> 01:17:28.260
I can't keep runnin'.

01:17:33.549 --> 01:17:36.015
But this is just the beginnin'.

01:17:39.889 --> 01:17:41.974
Whatever this life is...

01:17:43.526 --> 01:17:46.966
...I think it's just to find
the things you love...

01:17:48.198 --> 01:17:51.062
...and then when we cross over
to what's next...

01:17:52.769 --> 01:17:55.430
...we only take those things with us.

01:17:57.406 --> 01:17:59.258
I believe that.

01:18:00.043 --> 01:18:01.893
I do.

01:18:10.586 --> 01:18:13.422
I don't wanna go anywhere warm.

01:18:17.527 --> 01:18:19.579
I don't wanna keep runnin'.

01:18:26.068 --> 01:18:28.554
I want what I been waitin' for.

01:18:32.909 --> 01:18:37.511
I don't wanna wait any longer
and leave it to chance.

01:18:42.151 --> 01:18:44.596
Do you know what your asking me to do?

01:18:47.290 --> 01:18:49.967
I think it's the only way.

01:18:59.335 --> 01:19:01.554
It's okay to be scared.

01:19:23.826 --> 01:19:25.644
I love you.

01:19:28.431 --> 01:19:30.316
I'll find you.

01:21:09.166 --> 01:21:11.335
<i>Do you understand now?</i>

01:21:11.435 --> 01:21:15.246
<i>Where I'm comin' from with all this?
Why I believe it had to happen this way?</i>

01:21:19.175 --> 01:21:21.640
I'm tired of livin' in the darkness, man.

01:21:23.646 --> 01:21:28.066
It's all I've ever know,
all that's ever known me, besides her.

01:21:29.418 --> 01:21:31.456
You ever think about suicide?

01:21:32.556 --> 01:21:34.106
Hmm?

01:21:34.557 --> 01:21:37.010
I mean, really thought about it?

01:21:39.061 --> 01:21:41.478
Like there might not be no other way out?

01:21:43.566 --> 01:21:45.788
It's a dark place to exist.

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:49.606
And I've lived with the burden
of that for far too long.

01:21:49.706 --> 01:21:53.319
Longer than I can remember
and it's suffocating me.

01:21:55.511 --> 01:21:57.929
But at that moment
you can relay this verbatim...

01:21:58.029 --> 01:22:02.677
...to whoever you need to answer to
who decides my future beyond this room...

01:22:02.777 --> 01:22:05.822
...at the moment she asked me
to put her down...

01:22:05.922 --> 01:22:09.598
...because she knew we'd be together,
I didn't doubt her for a second.

01:22:11.594 --> 01:22:13.525
And I don't regret it...

01:22:13.625 --> 01:22:16.465
...because where she came from
and the hell we went through together...

01:22:16.565 --> 01:22:20.786
...no fire, no inferno could top that.

01:22:21.554 --> 01:22:24.409
In fact I'd invite God to the challenge.

01:22:36.886 --> 01:22:38.436
God?

01:22:39.021 --> 01:22:40.876
Where do you find him in all of this?

01:22:53.936 --> 01:22:57.337
Never easy puttin' down family, now, is it?

01:23:00.076 --> 01:23:01.894
Who the fuck are you?

01:23:03.812 --> 01:23:05.656
You know who I am.

01:23:18.028 --> 01:23:20.851
What's important is that you
listen to what I have to say.

01:23:36.745 --> 01:23:39.010
I'm gonna help you make a choice.

01:23:45.321 --> 01:23:49.193
<i>You see, I don't find faith in life...</i>

01:23:49.693 --> 01:23:52.892
<i>...or death or what's been taken from me.</i>

01:23:54.563 --> 01:23:57.043
Only in what's been left behind.

01:23:57.867 --> 01:23:59.370
Elaborate.

01:24:00.070 --> 01:24:02.088
I don't know that I understand.

01:24:13.616 --> 01:24:17.521
I grew up in the midwest, Tornado Country.

01:24:17.621 --> 01:24:20.756
And when I was a kid, we'd hear
the sirens and we'd all huddle together...

01:24:20.856 --> 01:24:24.475
...in the basement or the bathroom
and wait for the storm to pass.

01:24:25.662 --> 01:24:29.748
There's this one storm
that was particularly bad.

01:24:31.667 --> 01:24:35.288
I still remember the sound, the roar of it.

01:24:37.139 --> 01:24:40.603
But after it passed the whole neighborhood
came out to see the damage...

01:24:40.703 --> 01:24:43.297
...that's what we did, everyone in unison.

01:24:44.147 --> 01:24:47.632
And I mean, houses were destroyed...

01:24:48.050 --> 01:24:50.739
...cars wrapped around trees,
bodies of livestock...

01:24:50.839 --> 01:24:54.773
...cows, horses, you name it,
just strewn all over the streets.

01:24:56.358 --> 01:24:58.376
But among all the...

01:24:59.278 --> 01:25:03.364
...chaos and debris, there was
this one little baby deer...

01:25:04.039 --> 01:25:05.864
...a fawn.

01:25:06.068 --> 01:25:10.280
Just roaming among the wreckage,
looking for his family which was surely dead.

01:25:13.459 --> 01:25:15.895
You see, that's where I find God.

01:25:17.813 --> 01:25:20.417
And what's been spared from the madness...

01:25:20.517 --> 01:25:25.337
...where innocence prevails,
where all else is lost.

01:25:28.190 --> 01:25:30.271
That's what I found in June...

01:25:31.904 --> 01:25:33.916
...that's what she was to me.

01:25:37.199 --> 01:25:39.218
Does that answer your question?

01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:43.355
I believe so.

01:25:48.210 --> 01:25:50.347
So where are we with all this?

01:25:50.447 --> 01:25:54.118
And can I have a drink? I'm dyin' of thirst.

01:25:54.618 --> 01:25:58.149
We're close and yes.

01:25:59.055 --> 01:26:01.675
Have to run these files over
to the upstairs office...

01:26:01.775 --> 01:26:04.418
...before it closes tonight anyway.

01:26:05.228 --> 01:26:07.078
What can I get ya?

01:26:07.563 --> 01:26:10.448
- Just water.
- Sure thing.

01:26:11.333 --> 01:26:13.185
I'll be just a minute.

01:26:36.325 --> 01:26:39.496
- <i>It's me.</i>
- <i>What's the score?</i>

01:26:39.596 --> 01:26:41.465
<i>Shit's changed.</i>

01:26:42.015 --> 01:26:45.285
- <i>Got company.</i>
- <i>Aw, shit.</i>

01:26:45.385 --> 01:26:49.239
<i>Took off with the car and somethin'
else I couldn't afford to lose.</i>

01:26:49.339 --> 01:26:51.210
<i>Where's June?</i>

01:26:52.741 --> 01:26:54.326
<i>Gone.</i>

01:26:57.395 --> 01:26:59.199
<i>Where you need me?</i>

01:26:59.495 --> 01:27:01.551
<i>At the spot around nine.</i>

01:27:02.551 --> 01:27:04.069
<i>Alright.</i>

01:27:28.227 --> 01:27:30.680
I got this but I can't eat it.

01:27:41.390 --> 01:27:43.275
Pope's in town.

01:27:46.995 --> 01:27:51.016
We're talkin' about Pope, right?
Nazi Windtalker?

01:27:54.503 --> 01:27:56.791
Do we still have to leave in the morning?

01:27:58.241 --> 01:28:00.076
Holy shit, man.

01:28:00.176 --> 01:28:02.471
What the fuck's wrong with you?

01:28:08.083 --> 01:28:09.934
Holy shit!

01:28:13.522 --> 01:28:15.291
Alright.

01:28:15.391 --> 01:28:17.260
It's gonna be okay.

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:20.765
Look, I can't take you to a doctor
here, too many questions.

01:28:21.865 --> 01:28:23.715
Just, uh...

01:28:25.534 --> 01:28:28.471
...just wait 'till we get out
of state tomorrow, alright.

01:28:28.571 --> 01:28:30.803
We'll get you a fuckin' tetanus shot.

01:28:33.108 --> 01:28:37.514
I gotta go see my girl but...
you're gonna stay at <i>mi casa.</i>

01:28:38.014 --> 01:28:40.350
I'll be by at eight sharp to pick you up.

01:28:40.450 --> 01:28:43.068
- Crystal?
- Yeah.

01:32:52.334 --> 01:32:54.353
It's okay to be scared.

01:33:01.610 --> 01:33:03.872
<i>Whatever this life is.</i>

01:33:05.213 --> 01:33:08.686
<i>I think it's just to find
the things you love...</i>

01:33:09.786 --> 01:33:13.205
<i>...and then when we cross over
to what's next...</i>

01:33:14.256 --> 01:33:17.463
<i>...we only take those things with us.</i>

01:33:42.150 --> 01:33:44.654
<i>My job entails the screening...</i>

01:33:44.754 --> 01:33:48.357
<i>...for lack of a better term,
of the accused or condemned.</i>

01:33:51.561 --> 01:33:55.069
<i>I am what my colleagues and alumni...</i>

01:33:55.169 --> 01:33:59.050
<i>...set in that chair called the gatekeeper.</i>

01:35:55.083 --> 01:35:56.901
Which one?

01:35:57.752 --> 01:35:59.588
That one.

01:35:59.688 --> 01:36:02.144
Now you wouldn't lie to me now, would you?

01:36:04.093 --> 01:36:05.908
Why are you doin' this?

01:36:07.963 --> 01:36:09.514
Order.

01:36:12.668 --> 01:36:15.350
You're gonna kill me in there, aren't you?

01:36:16.305 --> 01:36:22.516
