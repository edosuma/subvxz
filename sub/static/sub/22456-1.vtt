00:02.054 --> 00:06.761
<i>I'm not sick but I'm not well</i>

00:06.811 --> 00:09.801
<i>...And I'm so hot</i>

00:09.848 --> 00:14.361
<i>Cos I'm in he-ell...</i>

00:19.122 --> 00:22.714
'OK, Jez. The love of your
life's coming back today.

00:22.759 --> 00:24.908
'Finish this shitty relationship.

00:24.958 --> 00:27.390
'Shot to the head. Nice, clean kill.'

00:27.436 --> 00:30.631
You're gonna have to plunge harder
than that. It's compacted grease.

00:30.674 --> 00:34.459
Yeah. 'She might go angry, and
I don't like her when she's angry.

00:34.511 --> 00:36.387
'Just got to tough it out.'

00:36.430 --> 00:37.828
Um... listen, Michelle.

00:38.508 --> 00:39.497
About us...

00:39.548 --> 00:42.776
I've been thinking about us!
You know I'm looking for a lodger?

00:42.825 --> 00:45.338
And you and me do go
really good together.

00:45.384 --> 00:48.135
Well, I was thinking,
how about you move in?

00:48.182 --> 00:52.650
Oh, right... That's interesting,
because I was thinking

00:52.698 --> 00:56.894
that I like you loads and loads,
obviously,

00:56.936 --> 00:58.925
but that also...

00:58.974 --> 01:01.247
we could... not see each other
any more.

01:01.292 --> 01:03.930
Stop seeing each other?
How's that gonna work?

01:03.971 --> 01:08.359
Well, I mean, instead of us calling
each other up and kind of meeting up

01:08.407 --> 01:11.317
and hanging out, we could try... not.

01:11.365 --> 01:15.560
Jez! You're so funny!
What are you afraid of?

01:15.602 --> 01:18.274
'You.'
Nothing. It's just...

01:18.321 --> 01:20.230
What I'm hearing, loud and clear,

01:20.279 --> 01:22.871
is that you're desperate for this
relationship to grow.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.986
You just don't know how it can happen.

01:25.036 --> 01:28.582
I was saying was that we should not see each
other any more, because...

01:28.633 --> 01:30.224
Shh. Jez.

01:30.272 --> 01:32.262
You've had your say.
Now it's my turn.

01:32.311 --> 01:36.347
You know how we have such
an amazing time in bed together?

01:36.388 --> 01:39.059
Well... Yeah.

01:39.106 --> 01:42.619
Well, I was thinking, what if
we took it to the next level?

01:42.663 --> 01:45.051
Like, act out our dirtiest fantasies.

01:45.102 --> 01:46.739
Yeah?

01:46.781 --> 01:48.099
I mean...

01:49.139 --> 01:51.332
W- What would that involve... exactly?

01:51.377 --> 01:54.606
Anything. You can tell Michelle.

01:55.614 --> 02:00.048
I guess I've always wondered what it
might be like... to have a threesome.

02:00.091 --> 02:03.764
- Is that too much?
- Are you kidding?

02:03.809 --> 02:06.037
That's vanilla! Let's do it.

02:07.406 --> 02:12.158
'Tonight's the night. Sophie's
actually coming over. For some work!

02:12.203 --> 02:16.273
'I don't think there'll be much
work - except sex "work"!

02:16.320 --> 02:18.388
'Don't think of it like work!

02:18.438 --> 02:22.224
'Fish pie then missionary sex,
and Newsnight afterwards. Classic!

02:22.276 --> 02:25.822
'Might make a joke about Paxman
and the economics woman. Paxo...

02:25.873 --> 02:29.466
'Paxo wants to stuff... Stuffing.
There's got to be a joke there.'

02:29.511 --> 02:32.581
All right, mate.
Will you lend us your phone, mate?

02:32.628 --> 02:33.777
What?

02:33.828 --> 02:35.419
Lend us your fucking phone.

02:35.467 --> 02:36.865
Why?

02:36.905 --> 02:39.815
- Well, I need to make a call.
- Don't you have your own phone?

02:39.863 --> 02:41.012
Lend us your phone!

02:41.063 --> 02:42.813
Right. It's just...

02:42.861 --> 02:45.328
"Neither a lender
nor a borrower be."

02:45.380 --> 02:47.494
Do you think we're some
pair of shithouses?

02:47.538 --> 02:49.016
No! God, no!

02:49.057 --> 02:50.728
It's just... It's a Blackberry!

02:50.776 --> 02:52.890
Give us your phone,
give us your wallet.

02:52.934 --> 02:55.730
Come on! Before we fuckin' do you!

02:55.772 --> 02:58.126
'Do me?! Are they gonna rape me?!

02:58.171 --> 03:02.718
'Or kill me?! If they rape and
kill me, I hope they kill me first.

03:02.767 --> 03:04.245
'I sort of win.'

03:04.286 --> 03:07.754
Is that it?
You got nothing else?

03:07.804 --> 03:09.316
- Yes.
- What else?

03:09.363 --> 03:11.921
There's my travelcard.

03:11.961 --> 03:15.871
'That's great! Help the muggers!
What d'you want? Approval?! '

03:15.918 --> 03:17.032
All right.

03:17.077 --> 03:18.987
Now piss off!

03:19.036 --> 03:21.912
'Oh, this really takes the biscuit.'

03:21.954 --> 03:23.227
Faster...!

03:23.273 --> 03:27.309
'I thought it was the muggers who
had to run off! The victim flees? '

03:27.350 --> 03:28.338
Faster!

03:28.389 --> 03:31.265
'Oh, this really leaves
a sour taste.'

03:33.466 --> 03:36.456
'This'll be OK. I'll just do the
threesome tomorrow,

03:36.504 --> 03:37.856
'then finish with her.

03:37.903 --> 03:40.495
'Bit ungentlemanly,
but then it's a threesome.

03:40.541 --> 03:42.531
'It's not exactly Romeo and Juliet,
is it? '

03:43.459 --> 03:44.652
Hey, Mark.

03:46.017 --> 03:47.495
You all right?

03:47.536 --> 03:48.888
Uh-huh.

03:48.935 --> 03:51.288
'No need to tell him what happened.

03:51.333 --> 03:53.368
'Just button up. Like the '40s.

03:53.412 --> 03:57.163
'People saw terrible things in the war.
They didn't go on about them.

03:57.209 --> 03:59.597
'They had a cup of tea and
invented the NHS instead.'

03:59.648 --> 04:00.841
Can I have a bit of your parsley?

04:00.887 --> 04:03.683
Get away! Fuck off!
Fuck off my stuff!

04:03.725 --> 04:07.681
- It's just a bit of parsley!
- Look, it's just...

04:07.722 --> 04:09.552
On the way home, I got...

04:09.601 --> 04:13.557
These blokes... mugged me.

04:13.598 --> 04:16.904
Oh, man. That is unlucky.

04:16.954 --> 04:20.184
'Of course, they target the frail.
They smell the weak.'

04:20.233 --> 04:23.268
So, what happened?
Did they pull a knife?

04:23.311 --> 04:25.107
No, not a knife.

04:25.150 --> 04:27.298
Jesus! A shooter?!

04:27.348 --> 04:30.338
No, they didn't have a...

04:30.386 --> 04:31.977
There was two of them.

04:32.025 --> 04:35.651
They asked to borrow
my phone, but...

04:35.702 --> 04:37.931
they didn't really
want to borrow it.

04:37.981 --> 04:39.538
No?

04:39.580 --> 04:41.012
No.

04:41.059 --> 04:42.695
Then they asked for my wallet.

04:42.737 --> 04:47.524
Uh-huh. So... they asked, and...

04:47.574 --> 04:50.450
you just gave them your wallet?

04:50.492 --> 04:53.687
Jeremy, I was in the underpass
with these two...

04:53.730 --> 04:56.288
gentleman who asked for
your possessions! Mark!

04:56.328 --> 04:59.238
You've got to toughen up!
This is the 21st century.

04:59.286 --> 05:02.719
You've seen Mad Max, haven't you?
That's what's going to happen.

05:02.763 --> 05:04.798
Mad Max isn't
necessarily gonna happen.

05:04.842 --> 05:07.593
Oh, sure. You live
in your Hitchhiker's Guide world,

05:07.640 --> 05:10.550
wandering around in your dressing
gown, and have a nice cup of tea.

05:10.598 --> 05:14.065
Yes, well, look...
Anyway, Sophie's coming over,

05:14.115 --> 05:15.786
so I'm gonna need the cooker.

05:15.834 --> 05:18.426
Right. It's just... I was hoping...

05:18.472 --> 05:21.428
You know, it's my big meal.
The big night with Big Suze.

05:21.470 --> 05:23.505
Right. Did you finish with Michelle?

05:23.549 --> 05:25.538
Yeah... Kinda.

05:25.587 --> 05:28.497
I mean, no.
She offered me a threesome.

05:28.545 --> 05:30.136
But what about?

05:30.184 --> 05:33.060
I thought you were dead set on
getting back together with Big Suze.

05:33.102 --> 05:35.092
I am, Mark! Totally!

05:35.141 --> 05:36.732
She called again tonight.

05:36.780 --> 05:39.894
God! What a great call!
It was like the old days.

05:39.937 --> 05:42.733
She was laughing like a... maniac!

05:42.775 --> 05:46.811
Right. So what about the threesome?
What about Michelle?

05:46.852 --> 05:49.648
Oh, well.
I had a bit of a plan about that.

05:49.690 --> 05:53.203
I thought I wouldn't tell Big Suze
about Michelle or the threesome.

05:53.248 --> 05:54.919
Oh, right! Brilliant!

05:54.967 --> 05:56.194
It's good, isn't it?

05:56.246 --> 05:59.713
Jez, are you sure about Big Suze?

05:59.763 --> 06:03.071
It's just it took you
such a long, long time

06:03.121 --> 06:04.917
to get over her leaving you.

06:04.960 --> 06:08.745
In a way, you never
totally got over her leaving you.

06:08.797 --> 06:12.390
Well, that's just as well then,
isn't it? Cos now she's coming back.

06:13.114 --> 06:14.910
So shut up!

06:19.470 --> 06:21.106
Great fish pie, Mark.

06:21.148 --> 06:23.456
Thank you, Soph. Thanks very much.

06:23.507 --> 06:26.144
I may not be an expert,
but I do my best,

06:26.185 --> 06:28.299
and that's all anyone can ask.

06:28.343 --> 06:31.617
'Just subtly lowering her
expectations in the bedroom there! '

06:31.661 --> 06:33.537
So, I was thinking...

06:33.580 --> 06:37.490
Maybe we could "work" a bit better
in the bedroom!

06:37.537 --> 06:40.095
I mean, it's fine
if you don't want to.

06:40.135 --> 06:41.123
Sure, great!

06:41.174 --> 06:45.722
'Oh, God! She's a man-eater. She's
gonna chew me up and spit me out! '

06:45.771 --> 06:48.283
Mark, where's all the lkea candles?

06:48.329 --> 06:50.558
Uh...

06:50.608 --> 06:52.359
It's Suze! Big Suze is here!

06:53.446 --> 06:54.924
Hi, Jeremy!

06:55.924 --> 06:59.675
Big Suze!
My, God! You're looking... great!

06:59.721 --> 07:02.677
Three years, yeah?
Three bloody years!

07:02.719 --> 07:05.436
I know, and look at you!

07:05.477 --> 07:08.911
God, you've changed so much!
But I think you might be wearing

07:08.955 --> 07:11.148
the same clothes
as when I last saw you.

07:11.193 --> 07:13.023
Right! What a weird coincidence!

07:14.111 --> 07:15.702
Oh, we should leave that for Stu.

07:15.750 --> 07:18.216
Stew? What stew?

07:18.268 --> 07:19.780
Who's Stu?

07:19.827 --> 07:22.817
Stu's my man! My hunk of monk!

07:24.384 --> 07:26.021
What the hell do you mean by that?

07:26.063 --> 07:28.291
Just that he used
to be a monk, that's all.

07:28.341 --> 07:29.490
He's just parking up the Golf.

07:29.541 --> 07:33.577
But... Your man? Cos I thought,
you know...

07:33.618 --> 07:37.449
On the phone, there was all the
laughing... I mean... I thought...

07:37.495 --> 07:39.609
What was all the laughing for?

07:39.653 --> 07:41.244
It was just laughing.

07:42.052 --> 07:43.927
Oh, right.

07:43.970 --> 07:47.199
What's the problem, Jez?
I thought this was gonna be nice.

07:47.248 --> 07:50.124
I'm with Stu,
you're with good old Michelle.

07:50.166 --> 07:53.793
'Shit! They're still in contact!
Think of something.' No, I'm not.

07:53.844 --> 07:55.878
Oh. Right. She just said...

07:55.922 --> 07:57.240
That was just a mistake.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.708
Followed by a series
of subsequent mistakes

08:00.759 --> 08:04.066
which, when you look at all together,
really don't add up to much.

08:04.116 --> 08:06.867
Anyway, I've done all that now,
so there's nothing stopping us...

08:06.914 --> 08:09.904
- We should let Stu in.
- Ye-eah... Should we, though?

08:11.031 --> 08:13.941
Hey, Stu-bod! This is Jez.

08:13.989 --> 08:16.422
- Hey, man.
- Hi. I'm her ex.

08:16.468 --> 08:17.946
Jez, don't be stupid.
We were never really...

08:17.987 --> 08:20.624
We lived together
for a year and a half.

08:20.665 --> 08:25.576
Well, we kind of did,
but in 2002, in that weird flat.

08:25.621 --> 08:28.850
- The Love Shack?!
- Listen, can we take a shower?

08:28.899 --> 08:31.013
- No.
- It was a really sweaty flight.

08:31.057 --> 08:32.534
There isn't that much hot water.

08:32.576 --> 08:35.407
That's fine. We'll share!
See you in an hour or so, yeah?

08:35.734 --> 08:39.690
'He's a monk. He's gonna have
15 years of spunk backed up.

08:39.731 --> 08:42.039
'How am I supposed
to compete with that? '

08:44.968 --> 08:49.481
Wow! This is a lot of candles.
It's actually getting pretty hot in here.

08:49.525 --> 08:52.356
I tried opening a window,
but a lot of them blew out,

08:52.402 --> 08:55.312
which, I suppose, actually shows
that electric light

08:55.360 --> 08:59.192
is quite a lot better. I know that's
not a very fashionable thing to say.

08:59.238 --> 09:01.192
'What am I talking about?

09:01.236 --> 09:03.465
'Jeremy's sex CD!

09:03.515 --> 09:05.902
'Better than Big Bond
Themes, I guess.

09:05.953 --> 09:07.670
'Bond wouldn't get mugged!

09:07.712 --> 09:10.508
'Bollocks!
Forgot to call and stop the phone.

09:10.550 --> 09:14.699
'Could go and do it now - pretend
I need a dump... Not very sexy.'

09:14.747 --> 09:19.817
So, Mark. Time for us
to get down to some work.

09:19.863 --> 09:21.580
Oh.

09:21.622 --> 09:23.020
Oh, yeah.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.809
'Oh, yeah, this is it!

09:27.858 --> 09:30.086
'This is really happening!

09:30.136 --> 09:36.048
'Relax. Stop worrying about the muggers
and their free calls! I'm getting sexy!

09:36.092 --> 09:39.321
'Bastards are probably going
through my address book,

09:39.370 --> 09:42.803
'randomly deleting contacts. That's
probably how they get their kicks.

09:43.846 --> 09:46.359
'Shit! I'm not kissing right!

09:46.405 --> 09:49.076
'Plus, nothing growing
in the pants department.

09:49.123 --> 09:51.271
'I'm as limp as a charity wristband.

09:51.321 --> 09:54.994
'Got to stop thinking about the
muggers! Be in the moment, Corrigan!

09:55.039 --> 09:57.597
'Shit, she's snaking up the thigh!

09:57.637 --> 10:00.593
'But there's nothing at the top
of it! Abort! Abort! '

10:00.635 --> 10:03.829
So, great.

10:03.872 --> 10:06.021
Great. That was great, Soph.

10:06.071 --> 10:08.822
Lovely... interlude.

10:08.869 --> 10:10.267
Right.

10:10.308 --> 10:12.900
But I think we should probably...

10:13.945 --> 10:16.094
I mean, this work
isn't gonna do itself.

10:16.144 --> 10:17.781
The work?

10:18.662 --> 10:19.810
Yup!

10:19.861 --> 10:21.976
The bloody work!

10:22.020 --> 10:23.611
I don't really care about the work.

10:23.659 --> 10:25.648
Oh. Oh.

10:25.697 --> 10:28.209
Sure. Sure you don't, Soph.

10:28.255 --> 10:30.210
Now, where's that broadband cable?

10:30.254 --> 10:31.606
I should be able to...

10:31.653 --> 10:32.971
Mark...

10:33.012 --> 10:36.922
I know it's taken us a while to get
here, but this feels really right.

10:36.969 --> 10:39.436
'Please don't touch my floppy cock! '

10:40.447 --> 10:41.765
I want you to be sure.

10:41.806 --> 10:44.841
I am sure, so, shall we?

10:44.884 --> 10:51.034
Oh, God, I want to, but it's just
these damn reports!

10:53.318 --> 10:56.149
'God. How long does a shower take?!

10:56.196 --> 10:59.152
'Still, drinking alone.
What's the big deal?

10:59.194 --> 11:01.706
'Why's it necessarily a bad thing?

11:01.752 --> 11:05.060
'lf you drink a bottle of vodka
and there's a bloke next to you,

11:05.110 --> 11:07.099
'does that somehow make it
all right? '

11:08.107 --> 11:11.142
I'm really parched, mate.
Mind if I've a swig of something?

11:11.185 --> 11:13.414
Whatever.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.532
'Jesus.

11:15.582 --> 11:20.050
'That's what a man should look like.
Those arms! They're amazing!

11:20.099 --> 11:23.009
'Like boughs of sturdy English oak.

11:23.057 --> 11:27.969
'My God, if you had them wrapped
around you, you'd just feel so safe.'

11:28.013 --> 11:30.446
Listen, Jeremy.
I just wanted to say...

11:30.492 --> 11:35.040
you've obviously got feelings about
Suze and the past, and that's cool.

11:35.089 --> 11:38.874
So listen, man. Really nice to meet
you, and no hard feelings, yeah?

11:39.725 --> 11:40.952
Sure.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.954
Ah ha ha!! How do you like that, Stu?

11:46.001 --> 11:47.831
You... monk!

11:47.880 --> 11:49.630
What does that even mean?

11:49.678 --> 11:52.429
You know what it means, Stu,
from how it makes you feel.

11:52.476 --> 11:54.431
That's what it means. Yeah!

11:54.475 --> 11:56.226
Welcome to big school!

11:59.671 --> 12:02.467
'Who needs to be a man
when you've got a knife?

12:02.509 --> 12:05.783
'Good old Mr Patel and his
illegal supply of knives.

12:05.827 --> 12:07.498
'OK, come on then, Mark.

12:07.546 --> 12:11.661
'T Mobile gave you the numbers the
mugger called. Ring the numbers!

back

'and not get humiliated
by Patrick in IT.'

12:16.220 --> 12:18.971
Hey! What you looking so
serious about there, Mr Corrigan?

12:19.018 --> 12:21.849
Oh, just... Nothing.

12:21.896 --> 12:24.089
I was wondering how far a girl like
you might go on a second date!

12:24.134 --> 12:26.771
Well, you know...

12:26.812 --> 12:29.041
At least second base!

12:29.091 --> 12:30.603
'Relax! Let it happen!

12:30.650 --> 12:33.684
'But nothing's stirring!

12:33.727 --> 12:36.081
'Uh-oh. She's gonna feel the knife!

12:36.126 --> 12:39.036
'Can't let her feel the hard knife,
or the soft cock! '

12:39.084 --> 12:42.517
Look, Sophie.
This is a hell of a laugh, and all,

12:42.561 --> 12:45.869
and I love horseplay
and light-heartedness

12:45.919 --> 12:47.510
and having a great time,

12:47.558 --> 12:52.264
but there's codes of conduct,
and disciplinary procedures,

12:52.314 --> 12:54.065
and it just makes me very nervous.

12:54.113 --> 12:55.670
OK, Mark. Just screwing around.

12:55.712 --> 12:58.383
We're not gonna get it on
in the photocopying room.

12:58.430 --> 13:00.465
Yes, Sophie. I know. Really.

13:00.509 --> 13:02.146
Let's have fun!

13:02.188 --> 13:04.142
Yeah!

13:04.186 --> 13:06.062
Look, I'm just...

13:06.105 --> 13:09.095
You know me. I'm old-fashioned.
I like courting.

13:09.143 --> 13:13.133
Look, why don't we
go to the pictures?

13:13.180 --> 13:14.851
Sure. Shall I bring a chaperone?

13:16.418 --> 13:19.089
I like your joke, Sophie.
A point well made.

13:19.136 --> 13:21.090
A point well made.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.532
Later, baby!

13:23.972 --> 13:26.326
'Ugh! "Baby"!

13:26.371 --> 13:30.407
'Note to self re being the Fonz -
Mark, you are not the Fonz! '

13:31.927 --> 13:33.564
'Threesome, oh, yeah.

13:33.606 --> 13:36.482
'Here I come! No need for Big Suze
ever even to know about... '

13:36.523 --> 13:39.275
- Big Suze!
- Hi, Jeremy. Here for the threesome?

13:40.161 --> 13:41.639
Well, yeah.

13:41.680 --> 13:44.988
'Oh, my God! I'm gonna have
a threesome with Big Suze!

13:45.038 --> 13:48.948
'Michelle's not some sort of macho
sexual terrorist! She's... brilliant! '

13:48.995 --> 13:53.826
- Hey, Jez.
- Hi! So, Suze. Brilliant to see you.

13:53.871 --> 13:57.418
Great, isn't it? I need somewhere to
live, and Michelle needs a lodger.

13:57.469 --> 13:59.344
You're moving in with Michelle?

13:59.387 --> 14:04.014
It's great, isn't it? I'd forgotten
how sweet she is. Ah, that smile.

14:04.064 --> 14:05.291
I know.

14:05.343 --> 14:07.902
Have an amazing time
with the threesome!

14:07.941 --> 14:09.453
Where's she?

14:09.500 --> 14:12.854
Come on. There's someone in the
living room to introduce you to!

14:12.898 --> 14:14.728
Jeremy, meet Vicky.

14:15.776 --> 14:17.174
Hi, there.

14:17.215 --> 14:19.886
- Does he know the ground rules?
- What?

14:19.933 --> 14:23.003
Has he had a shower?
He doesn't look like he's showered.

14:23.051 --> 14:25.688
Why isn't she talking to me?

14:25.729 --> 14:30.004
Vicky's just busy, OK? She's not sure
about this. She's doing me a massive favour.

14:30.046 --> 14:32.683
She'd just rather not talk to you,
OK? Vicky,

14:32.724 --> 14:35.111
- shall we go and get ready?
- I suppose so.

14:35.162 --> 14:36.913
You know where the bathroom is.

14:36.961 --> 14:40.315
You'll find anti-bacterial
shower wash by the basin, OK?

14:40.359 --> 14:42.313
'I will have had a threesome.

14:42.357 --> 14:44.426
'I will have had a threesome.'

14:44.476 --> 14:45.988
So, Jez! >

14:46.035 --> 14:48.501
A threesome! That'll be nice.

14:48.553 --> 14:52.066
My friend Jen did a threesome once.
She cried for an hour afterwards,

14:52.111 --> 14:54.464
but I'd still like to try it
sometime.

14:54.509 --> 14:56.543
Yeah, right.

14:56.587 --> 15:00.055
Suze, you don't want to go
back out with me, do you?

15:00.105 --> 15:02.095
Oh, Jez.

15:02.144 --> 15:07.089
You're such a nice guy. But I
think maybe it wasn't meant to be.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.936
Jez, we're ready! Listen,
you can skip the shower.

15:09.978 --> 15:14.332
Just use a flannel! Vicky
doesn't want to miss her train!

15:14.375 --> 15:18.365
'This is great. I'm having it large.
It's like I'm living in a porno...

15:18.412 --> 15:21.402
'except porn stars probably get
lovely sedatives

15:21.450 --> 15:24.121
'so they feel like
they're not really there.

15:25.847 --> 15:28.200
'Lovely sedatives... '

15:28.245 --> 15:31.474
'That wasn't depressing,
that was great.

15:31.523 --> 15:35.399
'Big Suze out of my life forever.
So what? I'm getting threesomes.

15:35.440 --> 15:38.908
'Why have I never thought about
drinking in the day before?

'What's more fun than a
couple of nice, cold beerskis?

15:41.316 --> 15:44.147
'What's depressing about that?
Nothing.

15:44.194 --> 15:47.548
'You can't be depressed when
you're pissed, it's not possible.'

15:48.631 --> 15:51.860
'Jeremy, I've got a lead. This
kid says he can get my phone back.

15:51.909 --> 15:55.057
'I've got to meet him at
Chicken Corner. I need back-up.'

15:55.106 --> 15:57.460
- 'I'm on it.'
- Jez, where are you?

15:57.505 --> 16:01.654
- I'm at the supermarket.
- 'Are you drunk? '

16:01.702 --> 16:04.498
Yep. I'm doing the big shop
and I'm doing it brilliantly.

16:04.540 --> 16:08.416
You're not just buying chocolate,
crisps and booze, are you?

16:08.457 --> 16:09.650
No.

16:09.696 --> 16:12.811
I also have dips.
'I'll say I ate the dips.'

16:12.854 --> 16:16.049
I just hope the drinking,
it hasn't become a problem.

16:16.092 --> 16:17.080
'Course not! '

16:17.131 --> 16:19.007
Shut up! Don't knock the drinking.

16:19.050 --> 16:21.960
It was while I was drinking
I came up with my plan about Stu.

16:22.008 --> 16:24.236
- What's your plan?
- I'm going to hit him.

16:24.286 --> 16:26.593
That's not really a plan as such.

16:26.644 --> 16:29.237
Of course it's a plan.
It's a fucking brilliant plan!

16:29.282 --> 16:32.556
I plan to hit him.
What isn't a plan about that?

16:32.600 --> 16:36.795
Look, I'll see you in a bit.
'I must look so cool to her.

16:36.837 --> 16:38.667
'Like Peter Doherty, or Bukowski.

16:38.716 --> 16:43.945
'Yeah, that's right, honey,
I'm a street-fighting man.

16:43.992 --> 16:46.504
'God, she's probably getting
wet just looking at me.'

16:46.550 --> 16:50.825
Hold your horses, honey, I've
got coupons for the Pringles.

16:54.785 --> 16:57.854
So, thanks for coming.

16:57.902 --> 17:00.210
I mean, obviously, your mate,

17:00.261 --> 17:02.012
I don't approve of what he's done,

17:02.060 --> 17:04.731
but there's no reason
why we can't be civil.

17:04.778 --> 17:06.368
Yeah, sure.

17:06.415 --> 17:10.487
So, what I'm after...

17:10.534 --> 17:14.762
What I'm demanding
is my Blackberry back.

17:14.810 --> 17:16.685
I might be able to help you.

17:16.729 --> 17:21.083
That would be fantastic, cos
it actually belongs to my office.

17:21.126 --> 17:23.762
It's going to cost you 50 quid, though, mate.

17:24.243 --> 17:25.642
No.

17:25.683 --> 17:28.275
- See you later.
- Yes.

17:28.320 --> 17:30.117
All right, cool.

17:30.160 --> 17:33.070
I mean... I think...

17:33.118 --> 17:34.947
I have to say, this is a bit rich,

17:34.996 --> 17:38.509
but I guess maybe there's certain
administrative costs

17:38.554 --> 17:40.350
for you to bear.

17:40.393 --> 17:43.507
That's 60, it's gone up
to 60 now, mate.

17:43.550 --> 17:45.699
- Really?
- Yep.

17:45.749 --> 17:50.899
Cos, obviously, this dynamic
could go on indefinitely.

17:50.945 --> 17:54.253
Is 60... Will that really be it?

17:54.303 --> 17:55.940
Definitely.

17:58.980 --> 18:03.606
Cheers. One more thing, would you ask
for it again, but in a lady's voice?

18:03.656 --> 18:05.611
I'm sorry?

18:05.655 --> 18:08.167
Ask for your Blackberry like a lady.

18:11.211 --> 18:13.087
- No, I really...
- OK, mate. >

18:13.130 --> 18:14.403
Can I have my Blackberry back?

18:14.449 --> 18:15.517
Please.

18:15.568 --> 18:18.558
Can I have my
Blackberry back, please?

18:18.606 --> 18:21.755
Listen, I'll call you
when I've got it, yeah?

18:21.804 --> 18:23.793
But he hasn't got my...

18:23.842 --> 18:26.991
Oh, no, of course. He'll have my
number from when I called him.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.677
Yes, and he'll
definitely be calling

18:32.556 --> 18:35.114
'Yeah, come on,
Stu, you stupid monk!

18:35.154 --> 18:38.906

18:47.266 --> 18:48.857
Yeah, I'm fine.

18:48.905 --> 18:51.178
'Probably missed the moment
to smack him now.'

18:51.223 --> 18:52.416
How are you?

18:52.462 --> 18:56.657
Do you want to? I'm just
heading back in for evensong.

18:57.659 --> 19:00.648
Are you OK, mate?

19:00.696 --> 19:03.084
You look like you could do with a...

19:05.973 --> 19:07.848
Yeah, that might be nice, actually.

19:07.891 --> 19:11.723
'Oh, the hug,
I'm finally getting the hug.

bit like one of the Shadow Cabinet.

lesson when Carl was in the Canaries?

No, definitely not.

to check it out, actually.

'Am I going to sit here and have
my evening ruined by some arsehole?

21:28.073 --> 21:30.539
'Just like when I put my parka on
backwards for a joke

21:30.591 --> 21:33.979
'and Terence Woo taped the hood
over my face and everyone laughed.

21:34.029 --> 21:38.099
'Well, I'm not going
to fucking take it any more! '

21:38.146 --> 21:40.022
What the f?

21:40.065 --> 21:44.613
Maybe that'll teach you not to
rustle your bloody popcorn!

21:44.662 --> 21:49.129
He was really rustling.
That's unacceptable.

21:52.856 --> 21:55.493
I can't believe you did that!
It was only the trailers!

21:55.534 --> 21:57.251
I love those Orange ads!

21:57.293 --> 21:59.600
I didn't expect that
sort of thing from you.

21:59.651 --> 22:02.004
I guess sometimes
people can surprise you.

22:02.049 --> 22:06.562
- You really whacked him.
- 'God, she loves violence!

22:06.606 --> 22:08.960
'They probably all do really.

22:09.005 --> 22:11.517
'They say they want you to
talk about your feelings,

22:11.563 --> 22:14.950
'but really they just want you
to beat and gouge your rivals.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.115
'Hey, there's the stirring!

22:17.159 --> 22:19.113
'The unstoppable rise.

22:19.157 --> 22:21.465
'It's like globalisation -
it's inevitable.

22:21.516 --> 22:23.187
'Hark at its stately progress.

22:23.235 --> 22:25.827
'This is it, the eagle has landed! '

22:25.873 --> 22:28.305
Mark, what's that in your pocket?

22:28.351 --> 22:31.466
Captain Corrigan ready to
receive his orders, sir.

22:31.509 --> 22:33.066
No, not that. The other thing.

22:33.108 --> 22:35.256
Oh, that.
That's just a little friend

22:35.306 --> 22:37.772
of mine called Mr Cutty Knife,

22:37.824 --> 22:41.735
in case I have to chop
down a rival alpha male.

22:41.782 --> 22:44.851
Mark, you carry a knife.
What the fuck?!

22:44.899 --> 22:48.014
'Oh, right. So they like hitting,
but there's some massive taboo

22:48.057 --> 22:49.694
'about stabbing.'

22:49.736 --> 22:55.523
No, it's not a knife, really,
it's for horses' hooves, whittling.

22:55.572 --> 22:57.925
Look, all right.

22:57.970 --> 23:01.358
It's just I'd like to learn
kick boxing to protect myself,

23:01.408 --> 23:03.362
I just don't have the time.

23:03.406 --> 23:08.716
So basically, what this is, is a
rather efficient time-saving device.

23:11.081 --> 23:14.435
'Good old Michelle.
Cold, but comforting.

23:14.479 --> 23:16.274
'Kind of like a friendly Dalek.'

23:16.317 --> 23:20.149
That guy's got a problem. He's like
some kind of David Koresh,

23:20.195 --> 23:23.821
Archbishop Tutu-style
religious maniac.

23:23.872 --> 23:25.941
Right, you're all done.

23:25.991 --> 23:29.264
OK, ready for some dirty playtime?

23:29.308 --> 23:31.616
Carry on the sex odyssey?

23:31.667 --> 23:34.054
But we've already done that.

23:34.105 --> 23:36.173
Oh, we did yours, Jez.
Now it's time for mine.

23:36.223 --> 23:39.019
'Oh, God, no! '

23:39.061 --> 23:41.733
I don't feel very well,
can't we do it some other time?

23:41.780 --> 23:44.814
Jez, we had a deal.

23:46.376 --> 23:50.003
But I really...
I really don't think I want to.

23:50.054 --> 23:52.930
Me think the lady
doth protest too much.

23:52.972 --> 23:55.359
'It was a sort of deal, I suppose.

23:55.410 --> 23:58.366
'Don't want to get a
reputation as a deal-welcher,

23:58.408 --> 24:00.238
'might stop me getting a mortgage.

24:00.287 --> 24:04.754
'Maybe it'll be better
if I imagine it's Stu.

24:04.803 --> 24:08.350
'Yeah, just imagine it's lovely Stu.'

24:15.076 --> 24:19.703
<i>Paranoia, paranoia
Everybody's coming to get me</i>

24:19.753 --> 24:22.982
<i>Just say you never met me</i>

24:23.031 --> 24:26.384
<i>I'm running underground
with the moles</i>

24:26.428 --> 24:28.019
<i>Digging in holes...</i>
