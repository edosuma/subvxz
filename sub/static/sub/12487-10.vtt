00:04.550 --> 00:06.750
Okay,
great job today.

00:06.820 --> 00:09.420
Remember, tomorrow is
your oral exam

00:09.490 --> 00:11.720
so everybody study.

00:11.790 --> 00:13.530
<i> Estudian mucho.</i>

00:13.590 --> 00:15.260
And anyone who
doesn't understand

00:15.330 --> 00:16.600
what <i> estudian mucho</i> means,

00:16.660 --> 00:19.000

a word?

00:28.840 --> 00:30.240
Sure.

00:35.750 --> 00:38.550
Bella, your written
and comprehension skills

00:38.620 --> 00:39.890
are excellent,
but I hardly ever

00:39.950 --> 00:41.720
hear you speak
in class.

00:41.790 --> 00:44.060
There's a perfectly good
explanation for that.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.560
Okay, what is it?

00:45.620 --> 00:47.280
I am not good at it.

00:49.160 --> 00:50.630
Bella...

00:50.700 --> 00:51.760
in all seriousness.

00:51.830 --> 00:53.570
If you fail
this exam tomorrow,

00:53.630 --> 00:55.000
your grade will
fall below a C,

00:55.070 --> 00:57.140
and you won't be able
to play football.

00:57.200 --> 00:58.800
It's school policy.

00:58.870 --> 01:01.470
<i> Señora,</i> I can't
not play football.

<i> mejor importante?</i>

01:05.680 --> 01:08.010
No, it's <i> más importante.</i>

01:08.080 --> 01:09.750
Or is it...

01:09.810 --> 01:12.880
Do you perhaps have
a pen and a ream of paper?

01:12.950 --> 01:17.060
Bella, you don't need
to write everything down,

01:17.120 --> 01:18.790
just say it.

01:18.860 --> 01:20.660
You'd be a lot better
at speaking if you weren't

01:20.730 --> 01:23.430
so worried about being
perfect all the time.

01:23.490 --> 01:24.650

Sorry, I'm listening
to this Spanish language app.

02:26.690 --> 02:28.190
I have a huge
oral exam tomorrow.

02:28.260 --> 02:30.800
And there's one small part
I have to brush up on.

02:30.860 --> 02:33.970
Which part?
The speaking part.

You got your work

Hey...

What?
You speak Spanish.

02:42.410 --> 02:44.740
Maybe you could tutor me
for the oral exam tomorrow?

02:44.810 --> 02:46.580
That's a great idea,
totally.

02:47.950 --> 02:50.850

You asked,
"When should we start?"

<i> Si.</i>
Oh, okay, let's see.

02:54.590 --> 02:56.920
<i> Nosotros empezar...</i>

02:57.790 --> 03:00.060
<i> Nosotros empezeh?</i>

03:00.120 --> 03:02.420
<i> Nosotros--</i>
Let's start now.

03:02.490 --> 03:05.690
Hey, Pepper, I'm gonna
help Bella study for Spanish.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.860
So we can't hit the Starcade
after school today.

03:07.930 --> 03:09.940
That's perfect
because I can't go either.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.670
I'm working on
a new project.

03:11.740 --> 03:13.110
I would tell you guys,
but it's kind of

03:13.170 --> 03:14.710
on the hush-hush
at the moment.

03:14.770 --> 03:16.010
On the quiet tip.

03:16.070 --> 03:18.270
The QT.
Supes confidential.

03:18.340 --> 03:20.110
Pepper, we get it.

03:20.180 --> 03:21.510
So I guess
we'll see you later?

03:21.580 --> 03:23.180
<i> Hasta mañana,</i>
<i> amigas.</i>

03:23.250 --> 03:25.120
Oh, showoff.

03:29.220 --> 03:32.120
Oh, Pepper,
you dropped your--

03:34.290 --> 03:36.260
What the heck?

03:40.130 --> 03:42.000
Pink paper,
glitter pen,

03:42.070 --> 03:44.240
and a bunch of guys'
names in numbered order.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.170
My sister makes these
all the time.

03:46.240 --> 03:48.010
Gentlemen,
what we have here

03:48.070 --> 03:49.880
is Pepper's crush list.

03:49.940 --> 03:51.780
Pepper has
a crush list?

03:51.840 --> 03:55.250
I mean, that's--
whatever.

03:55.310 --> 03:57.210
Check it,
my name is at the top

03:57.280 --> 03:58.520
with a star
next to it.

03:58.580 --> 04:00.250
Oh, and a little
red heart.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.750
I think that's
a piece of old tomato.

04:01.820 --> 04:03.890
In the shape of
a heart!

04:05.790 --> 04:07.490
Anybody else
we know on the list?

04:07.560 --> 04:08.690
Well, let's see, Newt,

04:08.760 --> 04:10.300
you come in at
a solid number seven.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.830
Congratulations.

04:11.900 --> 04:14.470
Ricky you're nine,
and Luis, you're ten.

04:14.530 --> 04:16.769
I could never compete with
that adorable face.

04:16.829 --> 04:18.160
I mean, look at him.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.970
It's a blessing
and a curse.

04:23.410 --> 04:24.940
What number am I?

04:25.010 --> 04:27.510
You're... not.

04:27.580 --> 04:28.880
What?

04:28.950 --> 04:30.320
Oh, that's impossible.

04:30.380 --> 04:32.180
Huh, guess
I didn't have

04:32.250 --> 04:33.950
as much in common with her
as I thought.

04:34.020 --> 04:36.290
What?
Oh, nothing.

04:36.350 --> 04:37.750
I mean,
I'm relieved.

04:37.820 --> 04:40.330
Who wants to be on some
dumb girlie list anyways?

04:42.060 --> 04:43.630
What are you doing?

04:43.690 --> 04:46.020
Sophie cannot see my name on
her best friend's crush list.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.070
Maybe I should buy her
some apology chocolates.

04:48.130 --> 04:50.270
My stepmom, Brenda,
loves chocolates.

04:50.330 --> 04:51.960
She locks herself in
the pantry and eats them

04:52.040 --> 04:54.340
while crying what I can only
assume are tears of joy.

04:54.410 --> 04:56.680
We have a very
happy family.

04:57.810 --> 04:59.080
Don't make
a big deal out of it.

04:59.140 --> 05:00.600
Yeah, just 'cause
someone's not

05:00.680 --> 05:03.880
on some stupid list doesn't
mean they're not awesome.

05:03.950 --> 05:06.150
You are so right,
Sawyer!

05:06.220 --> 05:08.220
Come on.

05:10.000 --> 05:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:18.130 --> 05:20.700
Okay, let's
try this again.

05:20.770 --> 05:23.270
I'm going to ask you
a simple question in Spanish.

05:23.330 --> 05:25.290
And you're going
to answer in Spanish.

05:25.370 --> 05:27.470
And try not to
write it down this time.

05:27.540 --> 05:30.210
<i> No problema,</i>
let's do it.

05:30.270 --> 05:31.270
Okay.

05:31.340 --> 05:34.050
<i> ¿Qué comiste</i>
<i> en el desayuno?</i>

05:34.110 --> 05:35.280
What do I eat
for breakfast?

05:35.350 --> 05:37.020
That is a great
question.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.920
<i> Yo, comi....</i>

05:38.980 --> 05:40.910
Wait, that's not
exactly right.

05:40.990 --> 05:42.050
Yes, it was, Bella.

05:42.120 --> 05:43.990
No, no,<i> comer</i>
means to eat.

05:44.050 --> 05:46.950
Oh, so I guess
that part was right.

05:47.020 --> 05:48.280
<i> Yo comi...</i>

05:48.360 --> 05:50.660
Don't overthink it,
just say it.

05:50.730 --> 05:51.960
Maybe I just

05:52.030 --> 05:53.530
need to write
some of it down.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.500
No, you don't have
a conversation

05:55.570 --> 05:57.040
by writing
things down.

05:57.100 --> 05:59.640
Yes, you do,
it's called texting.

06:02.240 --> 06:04.140
Let's just
try it again.

06:04.210 --> 06:06.950
<i> ¿Qué comiste</i>
<i> en el desayuno?</i>

06:07.010 --> 06:09.180
Is that your phone
buzzing?

06:11.820 --> 06:14.320
No writing.

06:14.390 --> 06:16.320
I can still write
with half a pencil.

06:16.390 --> 06:18.490
I've got small hands anyway,
so I don't really care.

06:18.560 --> 06:20.930
Bella, just answer
the question!

06:20.990 --> 06:22.460
Even if it's not perfect.

06:22.530 --> 06:25.330
<i> ¿Qué comiste</i>
<i> en el desayuno?</i>

06:25.400 --> 06:27.630
<i> Yo comi...</i>

06:28.730 --> 06:29.730
<i> Yo comi...</i>

06:29.800 --> 06:31.070
Go with
your instincts.

06:31.140 --> 06:32.300
Oh, I don't
wanna say it

06:32.370 --> 06:34.010
unless I know
it's right!

06:34.070 --> 06:36.510
You're stressing me out!

06:36.570 --> 06:38.530
I'm sorry,
who's the one yelling,

06:38.610 --> 06:40.250
and who's the one
that's a tutor

06:40.310 --> 06:42.350
and is not
getting paid?

06:42.410 --> 06:44.070
Oh, yeah?
Well, tutors are

06:44.150 --> 06:46.320
supposed to help you,
not make things worse.

06:46.380 --> 06:48.440
And you owe me
a new pencil.

06:48.520 --> 06:51.490
And you owe me the last
three hours of my life back.

06:56.990 --> 06:58.750
Oh, yeah, well...

06:58.830 --> 07:00.500
No,<i> tu eres...</i>

07:01.600 --> 07:03.170
<i> Tu eres...</i>

07:03.230 --> 07:04.630
Just hurry up
and insult me already.

07:04.700 --> 07:07.140
Say whatever you want,
just finish your sentence.

07:08.010 --> 07:09.170
You know what,
maybe it's best

07:09.240 --> 07:10.940
I study on my own.
Maybe you should.

07:11.010 --> 07:12.580
Maybe I will.
Fine.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.540
Fine!
No,<i> finito!</i>

07:14.610 --> 07:15.810
That's not even
Spanish.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.750
I can't hear you!

07:19.280 --> 07:21.080
Oh.

07:21.150 --> 07:23.990
<i> ¿Dónde está</i>
<i> la biblioteca?</i>

07:24.050 --> 07:27.150
Yes, nailed it.

07:31.960 --> 07:33.160
Guys, don't look now,

07:33.230 --> 07:34.570
but this is
the second time today

07:34.630 --> 07:37.100
I've seen Pepper trying
to sneak a picture of me.

07:37.170 --> 07:38.400
Yeah, tell me
about it.

07:38.470 --> 07:39.970
She sat next to me
in math class,

07:40.040 --> 07:41.570
and she was
totally checking me out.

07:41.640 --> 07:43.110
I mean, not that
I blame her,

07:43.170 --> 07:45.130
but, still.

07:45.210 --> 07:47.210
I know, she asked me
to move earlier

07:47.280 --> 07:48.310
so she could
get to her locker.

07:48.380 --> 07:52.380
I mean, give me
my space, woman.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.020
What should we do?

07:55.090 --> 07:56.390
You know, I think we need
to be mature

07:56.450 --> 07:58.150
and talk to her,
let her down easy.

07:58.220 --> 07:59.790
Explain that I am
a ladies' man

07:59.860 --> 08:02.090
who can't be tied down,
and you've got that whole

08:02.160 --> 08:04.000
unrequited thing
for Sophie.

08:04.060 --> 08:05.460
It's not exactly
unrequited

08:05.530 --> 08:07.300
when she asked to borrow
my pen in English class

08:07.360 --> 08:09.760
and keeps it
for the whole day.

08:09.830 --> 08:11.230
Just saying.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.860
The point is,
we're not available.

08:14.940 --> 08:16.580
And we need
to let her know.

08:17.910 --> 08:19.240
Come on, Sawyer,
you can listen.

08:19.310 --> 08:20.410
Oh, thanks a lot.

08:21.580 --> 08:23.050
Hey, Pepper!

08:23.110 --> 08:25.510
Hey, guys.
So... look.

08:25.580 --> 08:27.610
We just wanted
to talk to you about,

08:27.690 --> 08:29.190
um... feelings.

08:29.250 --> 08:31.980
For example,
I have many feelings

08:32.059 --> 08:34.460
for many different
ladies.

08:34.530 --> 08:36.059
A gaggle, if you will.

08:36.130 --> 08:38.360
You know what I'm saying?

08:38.429 --> 08:39.630
No.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.600
Newt, you're up.

08:41.669 --> 08:43.840
I like Sophie.

08:46.970 --> 08:49.140
Sophie!

08:50.510 --> 08:52.110
Okay, what's wrong
with them?

08:52.180 --> 08:53.240
They got problems.

08:53.310 --> 08:55.150
Hey, can I ask you
something?

08:55.210 --> 08:56.820
Uh, yeah,
of course.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.450
Do you like
my new boots?

08:58.520 --> 09:00.420
Yeah, they're
actually really cool.

09:00.480 --> 09:01.310
Thank you.

09:01.390 --> 09:02.550
When I first
saw them,

09:02.620 --> 09:03.790
I didn't think
they were my type.

09:03.850 --> 09:05.410
But then I realized
the boots and I had

09:05.490 --> 09:07.260
a lot more in common
than I thought.

09:07.320 --> 09:08.620
You know what
I didn't do?

09:08.690 --> 09:11.160
I didn't look at all
the other available boots

09:11.230 --> 09:12.460
and put 'em
on a boot list.

09:12.530 --> 09:14.670
Sawyer, what are you
talking about?

09:14.730 --> 09:15.530
Here's a hint,

09:15.600 --> 09:17.870
I'm not talking
about footwear.

09:17.940 --> 09:19.670
Nice boots, "Huggins."

09:19.740 --> 09:22.740
Those are going
on my boot list.

09:22.810 --> 09:24.640
Oh, sugar beets!

09:26.640 --> 09:29.800
Boot list?
What a great idea.

09:35.220 --> 09:36.820
Bella?
You're next.

09:42.390 --> 09:44.590
Okay, what's
my favorite sport?

09:44.660 --> 09:48.430
Um,<i> mi deporte</i>
<i> favorito es...</i>

09:48.500 --> 09:49.770
<i> Fútbol</i> is soccer,

09:49.830 --> 09:52.930
but that's not
exactly right.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.400
<i> Fútbol Americano.</i>

09:54.470 --> 09:57.140
Oh, wait, sorry,
I'll start again.

09:57.210 --> 09:58.580
<i> Mi deporte...</i>

10:00.280 --> 10:02.350
<i> Mi deporte...</i>

10:03.250 --> 10:05.380
<i> Mi deporte...</i>

10:05.450 --> 10:07.490
<i> ¿Dónde está</i>
<i> la biblioteca?</i>

10:10.320 --> 10:12.660
Nailed it?

10:14.220 --> 10:15.680
Okay.

10:18.300 --> 10:20.570
Bella, I'm sorry
to tell you.

10:20.630 --> 10:22.570
You didn't
pass your test.

10:22.630 --> 10:24.760
And it's school policy
that any student with

10:24.840 --> 10:26.370
a failing grade
can't participate

10:26.440 --> 10:27.770
in after-school sports.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.770
Coach, please...
Trust me, Dawson.

10:29.840 --> 10:32.680
This is the last thing
I wanna say.

10:32.740 --> 10:34.140
But...

10:34.210 --> 10:36.010
you're benched.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.850
I can't play
on Saturday?

10:37.920 --> 10:40.320
No, and until you get
your grade up,

10:40.380 --> 10:42.540
you can't play
football at all.

10:43.420 --> 10:45.560
<i> Ay, no me diga.</i>

10:45.620 --> 10:47.630
Hey, that was
pretty good.

10:47.690 --> 10:50.200
Does that count?
<i> No.</i>

10:50.260 --> 10:52.030
Which is
Spanish for...

10:52.100 --> 10:53.730
No.
No.

11:01.170 --> 11:03.640
<i> Señora,</i> there has to be
something you can do.

11:03.710 --> 11:05.280
I can't be benched.

11:05.340 --> 11:08.250
Bella, it's not like
I like doing this.

11:08.310 --> 11:12.620
Look, Dawson, you're--
you're a good student.

11:12.680 --> 11:15.180
The best quarterback
that we've ever had.

11:15.250 --> 11:18.760
Someone we definitely
can't win without.

11:21.360 --> 11:23.660
<i> Señora,</i>
you said it yourself.

11:23.730 --> 11:25.130
My written skills
are great.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.970
I just have
a hard time speaking.

11:27.030 --> 11:28.470
If you give me
one more chance,

11:28.530 --> 11:32.000
I'll study harder than
I've ever studied before.

11:32.070 --> 11:33.840
I'll memorize the Spanish
dictionary.

11:33.900 --> 11:34.960
I'll join
Spanish Club,

11:35.040 --> 11:36.540
I'll move to Spain.

11:36.610 --> 11:38.510
Please,
I'll do anything.

11:38.580 --> 11:40.380
<i> ¿Por favor?</i>

11:45.180 --> 11:47.690
Okay, you can take
a make-up test tomorrow.

11:47.750 --> 11:48.850
If you pass,

11:48.920 --> 11:50.120
you can play
Saturday.

11:50.190 --> 11:51.390
But...

11:51.460 --> 11:52.660
it's going
to be much harder

11:52.720 --> 11:54.180
than your last
oral exam.

11:54.260 --> 11:56.630
Instead of one question,
it's going to be a real

11:56.690 --> 11:59.020
conversation
between you and me.

11:59.100 --> 12:01.200
I promise
I'll be ready.

12:01.270 --> 12:02.970
I'll see you
tomorrow morning
before school.

12:03.030 --> 12:05.890
<i> Gracias, Señora,</i>
you won't regret this.

12:15.250 --> 12:16.710
Look at
the poor thing.

12:16.780 --> 12:20.450
Putting on a brave face
while she is dying inside.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.120
It must feel horrible
to have such a crush on someone

12:23.190 --> 12:25.260
and have them completely
reject you.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.360
Oh, Sophie,
I got you these--

12:27.420 --> 12:29.380
Whatever,
munchkin.

12:31.030 --> 12:33.930
She gave me
a pet name.

12:34.000 --> 12:34.970
Oh, hey,
here comes Pepper.

12:35.030 --> 12:36.070
Let's just say hi
to her.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.490
Make sure she's holding up okay.

12:37.570 --> 12:40.370
But be cool.
Hey, girl.

12:40.440 --> 12:42.210
Look, I know it hasn't
been easy,

12:42.270 --> 12:44.340
but you'll forget
all about us in no time.

12:44.410 --> 12:46.950
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

12:47.010 --> 12:48.580
Great first step!

12:50.780 --> 12:53.320
Okay, bye!

12:53.380 --> 12:55.040
Oh, Sawyer, I've been
meaning to tell you.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.620
I've started
a boot list.

12:56.690 --> 12:58.960
Total game changer.

13:01.330 --> 13:02.330
Poor Pepper.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.100
Breaking hearts is
never easy.

13:04.160 --> 13:05.630
You know,
you are so lucky you don't

13:05.700 --> 13:08.930
have to deal with girls going
crazy over you, Sawyer.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.970
I can't
take it anymore!

13:11.030 --> 13:12.290
What is wrong with me?

13:12.370 --> 13:14.740
How come I'm not on
Pepper's crush list?

13:14.810 --> 13:16.840
Why do you care?
You said it was dumb.

13:16.910 --> 13:18.580
It is, but--
but still,

13:18.640 --> 13:21.480
it's like... ugh!

13:21.550 --> 13:23.480
Sawyer, if it really
means that much to you,

13:23.550 --> 13:25.750
there might be a way to get
Pepper to notice you.

13:25.820 --> 13:26.990
Really?

13:27.050 --> 13:28.190
Yeah, we just
have to make you

13:28.250 --> 13:29.390
a little bit more
like us.

13:29.450 --> 13:31.880
Two guys who are
already on the list.

13:38.760 --> 13:40.270
Hey, Sophie.

13:40.330 --> 13:43.400
I know we're in a fight,
but the thing is...

13:43.470 --> 13:46.070
I failed my Spanish test,
now I can't play football.

13:46.140 --> 13:48.810
No, really?
Yeah.

13:48.870 --> 13:51.210
Listen, I know
I flew off the handle.

13:51.280 --> 13:52.640
And I know I said you
were a bad tutor,

13:52.710 --> 13:55.080
but it was
only because...

13:55.150 --> 13:57.120
I didn't want to admit
that you were right.

13:57.180 --> 13:58.950
I do sometimes
try to be perfect

13:59.020 --> 14:00.990
and overthink stuff.

14:01.050 --> 14:02.990
Anyway,
I'm really sorry.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.650
Do you forgive me?

14:04.720 --> 14:07.230
Aw, come here, Mama.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.400
Listen, I have
a make-up test tomorrow,

14:10.460 --> 14:12.730
so if I promise
not to overthink stuff,

14:12.800 --> 14:14.630
will you help me?

14:14.700 --> 14:16.130
Of course.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.900
I actually
have an idea.

14:17.970 --> 14:19.240
Come to my house
after school today.

14:19.300 --> 14:22.130
Thank you so much,
I will be there.

14:22.210 --> 14:23.810
Oh, I almost forgot.

14:23.870 --> 14:26.330
In anticipation
of our make-up,

14:26.410 --> 14:28.250
I got you some
apology chocolates.

14:28.310 --> 14:31.350
Oh, thanks,
you're the best.

14:34.320 --> 14:35.920
"Pepper means
nothing to me,

14:35.990 --> 14:37.120
love, Newt."

14:37.190 --> 14:38.420
I thought
these were from you--

14:38.490 --> 14:39.920
Chocolate
coconut!

14:39.990 --> 14:41.490
Your favorite.

14:41.560 --> 14:44.960
See you
at my house!

14:45.030 --> 14:47.030
They are
my favorite.

14:51.130 --> 14:53.060
Okay.
She's here.

14:53.140 --> 14:56.040
Let's do this.

15:03.010 --> 15:05.140
All right,
remember what I taught you.

15:05.220 --> 15:07.120
Now you go get on
that list.

15:07.180 --> 15:08.610
Wait,
one last thing.

15:10.520 --> 15:12.020
You're supposed
to waft it towards you

15:12.090 --> 15:13.420
for the faintest
aroma.

15:13.490 --> 15:15.290
It's called Manther,
for when love is the prey,

15:15.360 --> 15:17.400
and you're the predator.

15:25.940 --> 15:28.310
Oh, hey, girl.

15:28.370 --> 15:30.240
I didn't
see you there.

15:30.310 --> 15:32.110
Sawyer,
what are you doing?

15:32.180 --> 15:33.950
Oh, just chillin'.
Maxin', relaxin'.

15:34.010 --> 15:36.880
You know,
this is how we do.

15:36.950 --> 15:39.120
Ugh, you smell
like Newt.

15:40.380 --> 15:42.140
And what's with
the clothes?

15:42.220 --> 15:43.620
You don't like it?

15:43.690 --> 15:45.960
No.
Ugh, I give up.

15:46.020 --> 15:48.120
Here's your
crush list back.

15:50.030 --> 15:52.960
Crush list?
Oh, this isn't a crush list.

15:53.030 --> 15:54.870
It's not?
Then what is it?

15:54.930 --> 15:57.540
It's a makeover list.
I'm doing a calendar

15:57.600 --> 15:59.100
as a fundraiser
for the Bulldogs,

15:59.170 --> 16:01.210
and I'm using the football
players as models.

16:01.270 --> 16:02.940
The guys on the list
are the ones that are

16:03.010 --> 16:04.740
most fashionably
challenged.

16:04.810 --> 16:06.210
Oh!

16:06.280 --> 16:09.250
Whoa. Fashionably
challenged?

16:09.310 --> 16:11.080
M-- me?

16:11.150 --> 16:13.080
Why do you think
you're number one?

16:13.150 --> 16:15.390
'Cause I'm the most
desired?

16:16.450 --> 16:19.310
No. 'Cause you need
the most work.

16:19.390 --> 16:20.490
I mean,
for my calendar,

16:20.560 --> 16:23.630
we're gonna have
to step it way up.

16:23.690 --> 16:25.050
Then why wasn't
I on the list?

16:25.130 --> 16:26.500
Aren't I gonna be
in the calendar?

16:26.560 --> 16:29.190
Of course. But you don't
need help with your style.

16:29.270 --> 16:30.870
You have your own
cowboy thing going on,

16:30.930 --> 16:32.330
and it works.

16:32.400 --> 16:35.040
Or at least
it did before...

16:35.110 --> 16:36.670
this happened.

16:38.280 --> 16:40.110
Wow, I feel silly.

16:40.180 --> 16:42.610
And suddenly
self-conscious.

16:42.680 --> 16:45.650
Come on, Troy, I'll buy us
some comfort smoothies.

16:45.720 --> 16:47.520
The most help?

16:48.890 --> 16:50.320
You--

16:51.520 --> 16:53.830
I guess
I should go change.

16:53.890 --> 16:55.760
Sawyer?

16:55.830 --> 16:58.060
If... I did have

16:58.130 --> 17:00.200
one of those
crush list thingies...

17:00.260 --> 17:02.520
Are you saying you'd
wanna be on it?

17:02.600 --> 17:05.040
Well, I'd...

17:05.099 --> 17:06.700
You see,
for--

17:06.770 --> 17:08.740
Well, um...

17:09.910 --> 17:12.910
Yes, yes, I would.

17:12.980 --> 17:16.050
Well, good to know.

17:21.819 --> 17:23.390
Hey, Pepper,

17:23.450 --> 17:25.880
what if I'd one of those
crush list thingies?

17:25.960 --> 17:27.430
Would you
wanna be on it?

17:29.660 --> 17:31.560
Yes, yes,
I would.

17:33.100 --> 17:34.200
That's good to know.

17:34.260 --> 17:36.360
The most help?

17:38.700 --> 17:41.440
What, she-- oh!

17:52.350 --> 17:54.420
Ahh!

17:57.690 --> 18:01.030
Well, this place is
extra crazy today.

18:01.090 --> 18:02.360
Where are
your parents?

18:02.430 --> 18:04.260
Date night,
third time this week.

18:04.330 --> 18:06.660
I'm pretty sure
we annoy them.

18:06.730 --> 18:09.470
Are you sure you're gonna
be able to tutor me here?

18:09.530 --> 18:11.290
I am not going
to tutor you.

18:11.370 --> 18:12.740
You are going
to learn Spanish

18:12.800 --> 18:13.870
the way I learned
Spanish.

18:13.940 --> 18:15.370
By living it.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.870
Wait, I, I thought
you were going to--

18:18.180 --> 18:19.980
Oh, right, sorry,
my, my shoes.

18:20.040 --> 18:23.100
Uh-uh-uh...
<i> en Español.</i>

18:23.180 --> 18:24.650
<i> Lo siento.</i>

18:24.710 --> 18:27.010
<i> Bien.</i>
Here, take this.

18:27.080 --> 18:29.280
I usually talk
to my <i> abuela</i> about my day

18:29.350 --> 18:32.160
while she makes dinner.
Today, that's your job.

18:32.220 --> 18:34.560
By the way, don't say
anything about her mustache,

18:34.620 --> 18:36.680
or she'll hit you with
that wooden spoon.

18:41.130 --> 18:42.900
Uh,<i> esta mañana...</i>

18:42.970 --> 18:44.040
That means
this morning?

18:44.100 --> 18:45.870
<i> Si, esta mañana.</i>

18:45.940 --> 18:48.110
Um...<i> en biología,</i>

18:48.170 --> 18:50.110
uh, "I learned"
is <i> aprender.</i>

18:50.170 --> 18:52.270
So that past tense is <i> aprendí.</i>

18:52.340 --> 18:53.910
Although,
I could use...

18:53.980 --> 18:55.550
You realize <i> abuela's</i>
not going to flip

18:55.610 --> 18:57.450
that tortilla until you
finish your sentence?

18:57.510 --> 18:58.740
And those are
the tortillas

18:58.820 --> 19:00.350
you're going to eat.

19:00.420 --> 19:02.950
I can see why you are
the way you are.

19:12.160 --> 19:14.600
I mean... Yeah,
that's right,

19:14.660 --> 19:16.220
<i> un techo...</i>

19:16.300 --> 19:17.540
Ugh!

19:17.600 --> 19:19.170
I'm never gonna
get this.

19:23.870 --> 19:25.570
I appreciate
the encouragement,<i> abuela,</i>

19:25.640 --> 19:27.040
but I'm never--

19:38.120 --> 19:40.090
I overslept!
My test!

19:40.160 --> 19:42.990
Huh, what, what?
My make-up test!

19:43.060 --> 19:45.130
I'm supposed to be there
before school, I'm late!

19:45.200 --> 19:46.760
Oh!

19:46.830 --> 19:48.830
Oh, wait, don't
forget your shoes!

19:53.800 --> 19:55.860
<i> Señora Garcia,</i>
I am so sorry.

19:55.940 --> 19:57.410
Bella, what happened?

19:57.470 --> 19:59.130
You were supposed
to be here half an hour ago.

19:59.210 --> 20:00.540
I know,
but I fell asleep.

20:00.610 --> 20:02.350
See, I was studying
at Sophie's house,

20:02.410 --> 20:05.420
which is crazy,
by the way.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.020
And <i> abuela</i>
was all...

20:14.320 --> 20:16.880
So I ate the burned
tortillas.

20:16.960 --> 20:19.200
Oh, really?

20:28.040 --> 20:30.410
I am so sorry.

20:30.470 --> 20:32.400
Can I take
the test again?

20:34.240 --> 20:35.740
Well...

20:35.810 --> 20:37.650
I could let you
take the test again,

20:37.710 --> 20:38.740
but...

20:38.820 --> 20:41.550
I don't know
why you'd want to.

20:41.620 --> 20:43.950
You just passed
this one.

20:44.020 --> 20:46.460
<i> ¿Que?</i>

20:46.520 --> 20:49.280
You just had a conversation
with me in Spanish.

20:49.360 --> 20:51.030
Finally,
you were thinking less

20:51.090 --> 20:53.190
and speaking more.

20:53.260 --> 20:54.790
Congratulations.

20:54.860 --> 20:55.720
Really?

20:55.800 --> 20:57.270
Oh, my gosh,
I can't believe it!

20:57.330 --> 20:58.860
Why don't you
go tell coach

20:58.940 --> 21:00.140
you're good to play.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.830
<i> Vamos,</i> Bulldogs!

21:03.440 --> 21:05.340
I will, he's going
to be so excited.

21:05.410 --> 21:08.050
Oh, before you go,
quick question.

21:08.110 --> 21:10.180
Is that <i> abuela,</i>

21:10.250 --> 21:12.280
or do I need
to call security?

21:13.620 --> 21:15.920
<i> Tu zapatos!</i>

21:27.930 --> 21:29.730
Okay, Sawyer,
you're done.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.940
Let's go, Troy,
we're waiting on you!

21:36.040 --> 21:38.580
My baby's
all grown up.

21:39.980 --> 21:42.980
Wow, Pepper sure knows
what she's doing.

21:43.050 --> 21:44.780
Please, you think
anybody's gonna see

21:44.850 --> 21:46.120
a picture of me in this
getup and say,

21:46.180 --> 21:47.790
"Dang, what
a good-looking guy."

21:47.850 --> 21:50.520
Ooh, 'cause I would.

21:50.590 --> 21:51.790
Told ya.

21:51.860 --> 21:53.490
Well, don't just
stand there, girl,

21:53.560 --> 21:56.060
capture my essence.
