00:06.906 --> 00:10.243
- If there has been one business venture this year

00:10.343 --> 00:12.579
that has sparked water cooler conversation,

00:12.679 --> 00:15.015
it is without a doubt, LYTE,

00:15.081 --> 00:16.483
the pharmaceutical enterprise

00:16.549 --> 00:19.986
that promises a fast road to enlightenment

00:20.053 --> 00:22.922
without years of a spiritual practice.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.758
Joining us today are Dory Sief,

00:24.858 --> 00:26.760
the messianic face of LYTE,

00:26.860 --> 00:28.361
and Tunnel Quinn,

00:28.428 --> 00:31.931
the innovative billionaire who took a chance on her.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.200
LYTE's current valuation is $5 billion,

00:34.267 --> 00:36.169
growing rapidly every day.

00:36.236 --> 00:39.272
Dory Sief, Tunnel Quinn,

00:39.372 --> 00:40.507
congratulations.

00:40.573 --> 00:42.075
You are makin' the Big Bucks.

00:42.175 --> 00:43.410
How are you?

00:43.510 --> 00:46.212
- I am whole, and I am joyful.

00:46.279 --> 00:47.414
How are you?

00:47.514 --> 00:50.183
- Fine. So let's get into it.

00:50.250 --> 00:53.853
A lot of people are criticizing the viability of your company,

00:53.920 --> 00:58.525
particularly rumors swirling around your pharmaceutical team

00:58.591 --> 01:02.929
not releasing recent research to the FDA.

01:03.029 --> 01:04.931
- We are trying to accomplish something

01:05.031 --> 01:07.434
that has never been done before.

01:07.534 --> 01:10.136
So the steps work a little differently.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.906
We have a great relationship with the FDA.

01:12.972 --> 01:14.441
And we are working together to ensure

01:14.541 --> 01:16.776
that this pill is safe and effective.

01:16.876 --> 01:18.244
- Well, I gotta say,

01:18.311 --> 01:21.581
I-I think that the whole future looks...

01:21.648 --> 01:23.116
promising. - Wow.

01:23.216 --> 01:26.553
The "New York Times" called your company a cult

01:26.619 --> 01:27.921
with snake oil.

01:27.987 --> 01:28.988
What do you say to that?

01:29.089 --> 01:31.391
- Well, I'd be lying if I said

01:31.458 --> 01:32.959
we didn't expect that.

01:33.059 --> 01:36.296
You have to understand this venture is a marriage

01:36.396 --> 01:39.265
between science and spirituality.

01:39.332 --> 01:42.001
And when you bring existential matters into fields

01:42.102 --> 01:45.238
that are dominated by big pharma and big business,

01:45.305 --> 01:47.407
they're going to see that as a threat.

01:47.474 --> 01:48.508
And that's fine.

01:48.608 --> 01:49.909
You know, it's natural

01:49.976 --> 01:52.479
to challenge movements that pursue truth.

01:52.579 --> 01:55.615
- If I had an ounce of what she had when I was coming up.

01:55.682 --> 01:58.985
- Now, recently social media coming from LYTE headquarters

01:59.085 --> 02:01.154
have, um, images

02:01.254 --> 02:03.690
and videos of employees

02:03.790 --> 02:06.459
with chemical burns on their foreheads.

02:06.526 --> 02:09.028
This controversy has made its way overseas.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.598
The Duchess Leonora Hamsdale's royal estate

02:11.664 --> 02:15.969
has made their anxieties known through a recent video.

02:16.035 --> 02:18.037
So now let's take a look.

02:18.138 --> 02:21.374
- Leo, my love,

02:21.474 --> 02:23.610
please come home.

02:23.676 --> 02:26.846
Come home to mummy and grandmummy

02:26.946 --> 02:28.848
and all our staff.

02:28.948 --> 02:30.884
I'd like to think that we brought you up

02:30.984 --> 02:32.785
better than this,

02:32.852 --> 02:35.522
to go and burn your beautiful face.

02:35.622 --> 02:38.024
- Vile behavior.

02:38.858 --> 02:42.562
- Well, how does that make you feel seeing that?

02:42.662 --> 02:45.798
- I understand why some people might be put off

02:45.865 --> 02:49.569
by the unusual spirit of my workplace.

02:49.669 --> 02:53.373
But what other people think of us is none of our business.

02:53.473 --> 02:55.074
- Wow. I wish you two

02:55.175 --> 02:57.577
the very best of luck in your noble

02:57.677 --> 02:59.879
but polarizing pursuit.

02:59.979 --> 03:01.214
Thanks for coming on.

03:01.314 --> 03:02.815
- Be blessed.

03:04.817 --> 03:06.553
- That was great. Yeah.

03:06.653 --> 03:08.521
- And jeez, Dory, you are--

03:08.588 --> 03:10.757
you are a natural.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.992
Hey, this week, uh, you know,

03:13.059 --> 03:14.527
with the Hamsdale chaos going on,

03:14.594 --> 03:16.763
I think I should, uh, swing by the institute

03:16.863 --> 03:20.166
and make my presence be felt and pop my head in--

03:21.234 --> 03:22.902
- Oh, my--

03:23.002 --> 03:24.003
are you okay?

03:28.041 --> 03:30.577
- I haven't been feeling well lately.

03:31.878 --> 03:35.048
- Um, well, you could have somebody look at you.

03:55.768 --> 03:57.904
- Hello?

04:01.307 --> 04:03.076
Oh.

04:04.711 --> 04:05.712
Hi.

04:05.778 --> 04:06.813
- Checking in?

04:06.913 --> 04:08.548
- Uh, actually, no. Um...

04:08.615 --> 04:10.550
Sort of have a strange question.

04:10.617 --> 04:12.986
Um, I'm looking for someone.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.554
Uh, I don't know her name,

04:14.621 --> 04:16.789
but she attacked a friend of mine.

04:16.889 --> 04:19.492
I just wanna know what she knows about her.

04:19.592 --> 04:20.893
Uh, she might be connected

04:20.960 --> 04:23.496
to something called the Jesper Society.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.002
- What did you just say?

04:29.102 --> 04:29.969
- The Jesper Socie--

04:30.069 --> 04:32.138
- Shh! - Yeah.

04:38.911 --> 04:41.848
- How do you know about that?

04:41.948 --> 04:43.182
- Um...

04:43.283 --> 04:46.986
well, she attacked my friend with this.

04:49.922 --> 04:51.691
- Oh, my God.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.026
- What?

04:57.196 --> 04:59.499
What's--what's going on?

05:08.441 --> 05:09.976
- Annabelle,

05:10.043 --> 05:12.845
we have to get the group back together.

05:12.945 --> 05:14.947
It's happening again.

05:18.017 --> 05:19.886
- What's happening again?

05:19.986 --> 05:21.321
- Hey, everyone.

05:21.387 --> 05:23.690
I am coming on to respond to some mixed feedback

05:23.790 --> 05:25.325
I've been getting ever since myself

05:25.391 --> 05:28.795
and my LYTE community decided to make a bold statement

05:28.861 --> 05:31.464
in altering our faces to support our cause.

05:31.531 --> 05:34.000
First of all, no one forced me to do this.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.669
This was completely my choice, and I stand by it.

05:36.736 --> 05:39.372
- For, like, centuries people have shown their dedication

05:39.472 --> 05:41.874
to causes in all kinds of ways.

05:41.974 --> 05:43.976
- I feel bad for anyone who's been stuck

05:44.043 --> 05:46.312
with their same old forehead their whole life.

05:46.379 --> 05:47.714
- I no longer consider

05:47.814 --> 05:51.084
the Grand Duchess and Archduchess my family.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.319
Family has your back

05:53.386 --> 05:56.422
no matter what color your forehead is.

05:58.257 --> 06:00.893
- I actually think I'm on the right track here.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.730
So you're enlightened

06:03.830 --> 06:06.265
because you had a near death experience, right?

06:06.366 --> 06:08.434
- Mm-hmm. - So my first thought was

06:08.534 --> 06:10.837
to recreate that experience.

06:10.903 --> 06:12.372
- Exactly. - Anyways,

06:12.438 --> 06:14.440
I remembered something interesting.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.275
When I was little and in the summer

06:16.376 --> 06:17.777
I would go my grandma's house,

06:17.877 --> 06:20.113
and there were these awful little bugs

06:20.213 --> 06:21.948
called Phoenix Beetles.

06:22.048 --> 06:25.752
And they have something called Biological Thanatosis,

06:25.852 --> 06:29.222
which means that they can literally die

06:29.288 --> 06:31.858
for a few seconds as a survival tactic

06:31.924 --> 06:33.960
and then come back to life.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.796
And I couldn't help but wonder

06:36.896 --> 06:41.033
if something like that would be possible in humans.

06:41.100 --> 06:42.935
Does that sound crazy?

06:43.035 --> 06:45.705
- Ritchie, that is brilliant.

06:45.772 --> 06:49.142
- Yes! Yes! - That is gre--that's insane.

06:49.242 --> 06:53.980
- So if we bind the Phoenix Beetle enzymes

06:54.080 --> 06:56.382
with the euphoric neurochemicals,

06:56.449 --> 06:59.218
we could create a... big bang.

06:59.285 --> 07:00.553
Hold these for me, love.

07:00.620 --> 07:01.654
- Yeah.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.490
- Oh, my God! - Oh, sorry.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.460
My hands seem to be a little too numb to hold on to things.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.995
- - Don't worry, honey.

07:09.095 --> 07:10.663
The visuals are just a learning tool.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.765
You get the gist. - Okay.

07:12.832 --> 07:15.835
- Well, this is exciting. -

07:15.935 --> 07:18.404
- There's just one hiccup. - Hmm?

07:18.471 --> 07:19.972
- Which is that I need access

07:20.072 --> 07:22.909
to the biological samples to isolate the enzymes,

07:22.975 --> 07:26.746
and I know the lab upstairs has a huge library of samples,

07:26.813 --> 07:30.149
but ever since we used their chemicals to burn our foreheads

07:30.249 --> 07:33.019
they've required a special pharma clearance.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.120
- Mm, that sucks.

07:34.187 --> 07:35.588
- Wait, El. - What's up?

07:35.655 --> 07:37.356
- Doesn't Dr. Carpet have pharma clearance?

07:37.457 --> 07:41.027
Maybe he could help us, you know, gather some supplies.

07:42.261 --> 07:44.030
- I don't know. I don't know.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.698
Yeah, because, um,

07:45.798 --> 07:49.469
he's actually going through, like, a really nasty divorce.

07:49.535 --> 07:52.538
Yeah, his wife cheated on him

07:52.638 --> 07:55.341
with, um, his own parents.

07:55.441 --> 07:57.810
- Oh. - Yeah, it's fucking perverted.

07:57.877 --> 07:59.846
Yeah, so I just don't think he's in a place right now

07:59.946 --> 08:02.181
where we could ask him to do us a favor, you know.

08:02.281 --> 08:04.450
Is there any other way? Any other way.

08:04.517 --> 08:06.886
- Without the sample,

08:06.986 --> 08:10.223
it could take us years to get that shipped.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.893
And it's not easy to come by, Elliott.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.328
- Okay.

08:15.394 --> 08:16.863
- All right, well, maybe I need to talk to him.

08:16.963 --> 08:17.830
- No!

08:17.897 --> 08:19.532
Sorry. Sorry.

08:19.632 --> 08:22.668
I'm just very protective of my relationship with Dr. Carpet.

08:22.735 --> 08:25.972
So why don't I just feel it out with him, test the waters.

08:26.038 --> 08:27.507
Happy to do it. - Okay.

08:27.573 --> 08:28.808
Wonderful. - Cool.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.511
- Wonderful. Wonderful. Wonderful.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.580
- Okay. I did it!

08:34.680 --> 08:36.682
My hand's burning from whatever the liquid is,

08:36.749 --> 08:38.184
but I did it.

08:38.251 --> 08:40.920
- So is the Jesper thing connected to my friend Dory?

08:41.020 --> 08:43.890
'Cause I-I just wanna find out who the woman is.

08:43.990 --> 08:45.558
That's all I--

08:51.764 --> 08:53.900
- Annabelle.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.201
- John.

08:57.436 --> 08:59.238
Oh.

08:59.338 --> 09:02.341
You look exactly the same.

09:02.408 --> 09:04.110
- I called the others.

09:08.414 --> 09:11.617
- So you're the one.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.519
- Yeah. Well, I-I guess so.

09:13.586 --> 09:15.588
I'm really just trying to find out some more information

09:15.688 --> 09:17.723
about this woman who stabbed my friend.

09:19.859 --> 09:21.260
- Oh, my word.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.596
- Wally Winhead, is it really you?

09:23.696 --> 09:24.797
- It sure is.

09:24.897 --> 09:26.265
- What happened to the rest of you?

09:26.365 --> 09:28.568
- Personal trainer and a Wall Street salary.

09:28.634 --> 09:30.436
- Good on you. Good on--

09:30.536 --> 09:33.272
- Anybody order a 50-year-old knish?

09:33.372 --> 09:35.374
- Oh! - Wow.

09:35.441 --> 09:38.411
Always a kidder, right?

09:38.477 --> 09:40.479
Come here. - Annabelle.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.615
- No. Yeah. No.

09:42.715 --> 09:44.450
No, no. Hey. Hey.

09:44.550 --> 09:46.752
So, hey-uh! Uh!

09:46.819 --> 09:50.990
Sorry, I just need your help for...a minute.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.659
I just have a very simple question.

09:53.759 --> 09:57.330
I'm just trying to track down the woman who owned this.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.664
- - Holy Toledo.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.299
- He's back. - Oh, no, no.

10:00.399 --> 10:01.834
- W-who? Jes--Jesper?

10:01.934 --> 10:02.935
- Shh! - Thith ith bad.

10:03.002 --> 10:04.070
Thith ith bad.

10:04.136 --> 10:05.938
My lithp, ith back.

10:06.005 --> 10:08.240
After 30 years. Ith back.

10:08.307 --> 10:09.675
- It's him. It's him.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.110
What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?

10:11.177 --> 10:12.511
- All right. All right.

10:12.612 --> 10:14.513
Don't get hysterical. We're gonna be okay.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.683
- Well, I have a family. I can't get them involved.

10:19.952 --> 10:22.488
- You have a family?

10:22.588 --> 10:24.023
- I do.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.859
- Just, can someone tell me what's happening, or--

10:26.959 --> 10:29.028
What is this?

10:30.863 --> 10:32.331
- We all have them.

10:32.431 --> 10:34.367
- Jesper Society.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.801
- I thought this was over.

10:35.868 --> 10:38.204
- Well, apparently he's found a new host.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.272
- Okay, so the woman who stabbed my friend,

10:40.339 --> 10:41.707
she had this. -

10:41.807 --> 10:43.676
- Matilda. Sthe sthould be here.

10:43.776 --> 10:45.544
- I called her. She did not pick up.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.279
- What is-- what's Matilda's last name?

10:47.346 --> 10:48.614
- I can't do thith.

10:48.681 --> 10:50.216
I'm not sthrong. I can't do it. Not again.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.550
- Paully. - I can't.

10:51.651 --> 10:52.652
- Paully!

10:52.718 --> 10:54.820
Don't get scared, Paully.

10:54.887 --> 10:57.123
That's what the Jesper wants.

10:57.189 --> 10:59.158
Fear is what it feeds on.

10:59.225 --> 11:02.828
- What's Matilda's last name, though?

11:02.895 --> 11:06.365
Could someone just please, maybe, before the Jesper comes

11:06.465 --> 11:09.468
or whatever, we could get Matilda's last name out.

11:11.837 --> 11:12.905
Guy--

11:16.842 --> 11:18.811
- In 1981,

11:18.878 --> 11:22.982
this town was under siege by...

11:23.049 --> 11:25.251
the Jesper.

11:25.351 --> 11:30.589
And only five children could see him.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.659
And we banded together to fight.

11:33.726 --> 11:36.328
- I don't--I don't-- I don't care!

11:36.395 --> 11:39.565
So would somebody here please for the love of God

11:39.665 --> 11:44.737
just tell me what is Matilda's last name?

11:44.837 --> 11:46.439
all: Lombardo.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.108
- Lombardo.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.076
Thank you.

11:50.176 --> 11:51.744
Jesus Christ.

11:51.844 --> 11:54.113
Why was that the hardest thing I've ever had to do

11:54.213 --> 11:55.781
in my entire life?

11:55.881 --> 11:59.285
It is so late now!

12:02.755 --> 12:06.625
Matilda...Lombardo.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.267
That was Dory's asylum.

12:27.813 --> 12:29.615
Ugh.

12:30.649 --> 12:33.786
- Portia, I'm really sick.

12:33.886 --> 12:36.889
- Oh, I know, sweetie. I know.

12:36.956 --> 12:40.593
It seems like you just have a really bad bug.

13:15.161 --> 13:18.430
- Well, well, well. Look who's back.

13:18.497 --> 13:19.965
- Hi, Benny.

13:20.032 --> 13:22.134
- You didn't show up.

13:22.201 --> 13:23.469
- I know.

13:23.536 --> 13:25.538
I'm sorry.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.373
- Meet at the fountain at midnight.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.108
That's what we agreed on.

13:29.175 --> 13:30.943
Do you know how stupid I felt?

13:31.010 --> 13:33.612
- I'm all fucked up. I'm a mess.

13:33.679 --> 13:35.447
I'm a bastard. A dog.

13:35.514 --> 13:39.018
- Then you come in here to my lab.

13:39.118 --> 13:41.320
I may never see my children again.

13:42.321 --> 13:45.124
- I--

13:45.191 --> 13:46.892
I do...

13:46.992 --> 13:49.228
want to be with you.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.463
Dr. Benny.

13:51.530 --> 13:53.566
- Damn it, I can't resist you.

13:56.368 --> 13:58.137
Let's go to the airport.

13:58.204 --> 13:59.371
Tonight.

13:59.471 --> 14:01.307
Let's change our lives together.

14:01.373 --> 14:03.709
- Okay. Yes.

14:03.809 --> 14:06.478
I absolutely agree to that.

14:11.717 --> 14:16.088
If I were the Phoenix Beetle samples, where would I be?

14:16.188 --> 14:18.257
- What?

14:18.357 --> 14:19.725
- Kiss me.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.199
- You got it. Yay!

14:27.266 --> 14:29.501
- Okay, that is all there is. There is no more.

14:29.568 --> 14:31.937
And Dr. Carpet is no longer willing to cooperate.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.506
I think he's gonna kill himself.

15:30.262 --> 15:31.830
- Hello. - Hi.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.899
- Hi. - Visitor

15:33.966 --> 15:36.001
or checking yourself in?

15:36.101 --> 15:37.603
- Neither, actually.

15:37.670 --> 15:38.938
I was wondering if I could meet

15:39.004 --> 15:41.507
with Dr. Philip Lombardo?

15:43.342 --> 15:46.812
- What did you wanna meet with Dr. Lombardo about?

15:46.912 --> 15:49.949
- Uh, it's about his connection to a friend and colleague.

15:50.015 --> 15:52.918
Her name's Dory Sief, she was a patient here.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.523
- I don't wanna lose my job

15:57.623 --> 15:59.425
so I'm gonna need you to leave.

15:59.491 --> 16:00.759
- I'm sorry, what?

16:00.826 --> 16:02.594
- Please get out right now. - Okay.

16:02.661 --> 16:04.029
- Go. - You're serious?

16:04.129 --> 16:05.497
- Get out. Just get out! - Okay. Yeah, yeah.

16:05.597 --> 16:07.199
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Go! Now!

16:07.299 --> 16:09.201
- Hey. I-- Is there somebody else

16:09.301 --> 16:10.636
that maybe I could speak to about this?

16:10.703 --> 16:14.173
- Yo, man, you need to listen to her.

16:14.273 --> 16:16.342
Okay?

16:16.442 --> 16:17.810
- Okay, yeah.

16:32.358 --> 16:33.659
Ahh!

16:36.228 --> 16:37.830
- You're Drew Gardner?

16:37.896 --> 16:38.731
- Yes.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.533
- You are in great danger.

16:41.633 --> 16:42.735
- I'm sorry, what?

16:42.835 --> 16:45.070
- Dory Sief is not well.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.238
- What?

16:46.338 --> 16:47.406
- It is my personal opinion

16:47.506 --> 16:48.407
that she should not be allowed

16:48.507 --> 16:49.742
to roam about the world

16:49.842 --> 16:52.544
freely influencing the minds of others.

16:52.644 --> 16:54.079
- Are you Dr. Lombardo?

16:54.179 --> 16:55.514
- No, I'm Dr. Flesh.

16:55.581 --> 16:57.983
Dr. Lombardo was her primary psychologist.

16:58.050 --> 17:00.386
Dr. Lombardo took his own life.

17:00.486 --> 17:02.821
And it is my belief that Ms. Sief encouraged him

17:02.888 --> 17:06.425
to do so in pursuit of some enlightened resurrection.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.161
But there's no coming back from death.

17:09.228 --> 17:10.763
We were all fascinated by her.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.031
I masturbated to her a few times, but--

17:13.098 --> 17:14.533
- What? No. Why would--no!

17:14.600 --> 17:16.835
- One thing I do feel certain of

17:16.902 --> 17:18.437
is that her particular conviction

17:18.537 --> 17:20.072
in a higher existence

17:20.172 --> 17:23.442
does not make her the guru that people believe she is.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.844
This delusional spirituality

17:25.911 --> 17:28.447
is nothing more than schizotypal traits.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.282
- What should I do?

17:30.382 --> 17:31.850
- If she isn't stopped,

17:31.917 --> 17:34.420
she will continue to destroy.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.556
Yeah, take this.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.091
She made it.

17:39.191 --> 17:41.794
This is what it's like inside her head.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.863
She believes the world is coming to a brutal

17:44.930 --> 17:46.598
apocalyptic ending,

17:46.698 --> 17:48.734
unless she can stop it.

17:48.801 --> 17:49.902
And also,

17:49.968 --> 17:52.137
don't tell anyone I gave that to you

17:52.237 --> 17:53.772
or said any of this.

17:53.872 --> 17:56.208
It's simply inappropriate of me.

17:56.275 --> 17:57.976
- Hey, hey. Wait! Wait a--

18:01.780 --> 18:03.949
Oh, holy hell.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.277
That's the LYTE logo.

18:36.348 --> 18:38.150
- So I'm not exactly sure what this means,

18:38.250 --> 18:40.519
but I feel like it could be a good sign.

18:40.619 --> 18:43.188
You see this guy here?

18:43.288 --> 18:44.456
- Yeah.

18:44.523 --> 18:46.325
- This is Gemini.

18:46.425 --> 18:49.695
And you may notice now that he's dead.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.264
But if you look at the brain scan,

18:52.331 --> 18:54.133
you'll see something promising.

18:54.199 --> 18:58.370
Right after he died, his brain was flooded with neurochemicals

18:58.470 --> 19:01.106
here, here, here, and here,

19:01.173 --> 19:04.109
which I hope is in alignment with what you experienced.

19:04.176 --> 19:05.544
This guy didn't make it out.

19:05.644 --> 19:07.679
So I'm hoping that I can tweak the formula

19:07.779 --> 19:11.183
so that his brain chemistry enacts with the beetle enzymes,

19:11.283 --> 19:13.719
and hoping that it could work.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.522
- Oh, that's exciting. Ooh.

19:16.622 --> 19:18.190
- Honey, y-you're bleeding.

19:18.290 --> 19:20.325
Do you need a tissue? - What?

19:22.394 --> 19:23.662
Thank you.

19:23.729 --> 19:26.064
- Have you considered the possibility

19:26.165 --> 19:28.033
that you're being poisoned?

19:28.133 --> 19:30.335
You're exhibiting all of the symptoms.

19:30.402 --> 19:32.137
- Poisoned?

19:36.675 --> 19:38.177
- Here sweetie pie.

19:38.243 --> 19:39.678
Hopefully this helps.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.213
- Aw, thank you, Portia.

19:41.313 --> 19:43.081
So good of you to be by my side.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.317
- Of course. - Okay, Dory,

19:45.384 --> 19:47.719
so we're sending your blood samples to the lab

19:47.819 --> 19:50.756
for a more thorough report, but your urine test

19:50.856 --> 19:54.226
does indicate a very high toxicity level.

19:54.326 --> 19:55.761
- So what does that mean?

19:55.861 --> 19:58.197
- It means that you've been exposed to chemicals

19:58.263 --> 20:01.166
that are seriously compromising your immune system.

20:01.233 --> 20:02.668
I can tell you

20:02.734 --> 20:04.603
that you've been interacting with something toxic,

20:04.703 --> 20:07.606
and I would suspect it's been a routine exposure,

20:07.706 --> 20:10.042
given how extreme this test result is.

20:10.108 --> 20:11.276
- Oh, my God.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.446
So she, like, has been poisoned?

20:14.546 --> 20:16.248
- I would imagine so.

20:16.348 --> 20:18.750
People in your position often are.

20:30.963 --> 20:34.533
- Okay, a little more butt.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.735
Nice. Oh, shake it.

20:38.604 --> 20:40.372
- Dory, do you need help with something?

20:47.279 --> 20:48.714
- Whose bag is this?

20:48.780 --> 20:50.983
- Oh, that's mine.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.485
Do you need, like, a tampon

20:53.585 --> 20:56.655
or a Ludens or something?

21:04.796 --> 21:06.465
- Hello?

21:12.904 --> 21:19.778
Gemini?

21:19.845 --> 21:21.947
Oh, my God.

21:22.014 --> 21:24.750
You're alive.

21:24.816 --> 21:27.586
You're alive. I can't believe it.

21:33.091 --> 21:34.259
- Whoa. Okay, be careful.

21:34.326 --> 21:35.360
This crystal's very fragile. I--

21:35.460 --> 21:37.262
- Don't touch any of this!

21:37.329 --> 21:38.697
Don't. Back away.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.666
- Dory, is everything okay?

21:57.683 --> 21:59.551
- Something very bad is happening.

21:59.651 --> 22:01.486
Okay, very bad is happening,

22:01.553 --> 22:02.888
and it's so not cool.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.523
- What is happening?

22:04.623 --> 22:05.891
- Someone is poisoning Dory,

22:05.991 --> 22:07.292
and it's probably one of you.

22:07.359 --> 22:08.994
- One of us? Who would do that?

22:09.061 --> 22:11.330
- Hmm, I don't know.

22:11.396 --> 22:12.798
With questions like that,

22:12.864 --> 22:14.499
wouldn't be surprised if it was you, Marty.

22:14.566 --> 22:16.368
- I would never. - Oh, shut up.

22:17.469 --> 22:20.505
- Wait. Where'd you go?

22:20.572 --> 22:22.240
Gemini!

22:22.341 --> 22:24.743
- Whose is this?

22:24.843 --> 22:26.211
- It's mine.

22:28.246 --> 22:29.681
- What is this?

22:29.748 --> 22:31.216
- Makeup remover.

22:37.989 --> 22:39.925
- Text me back, damn it.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.526
I love you.

22:43.762 --> 22:44.830
Ah!

22:46.531 --> 22:49.434
- Whoever did this

22:49.534 --> 22:51.269
is seriously, like, going to jail.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.871
This is not a joke.

22:52.938 --> 22:56.074
This is a complete and total deal breaker.

22:57.709 --> 22:58.777
It's insane.

22:58.877 --> 22:59.911
I can't believe that someone

23:00.011 --> 23:01.747
would even consider doing this.

23:01.847 --> 23:04.383
One of the more horrific things I've even ever thought about.

23:04.449 --> 23:06.551
What?

23:06.618 --> 23:08.186
Dory, you already doing-- I'm ticklish!

23:08.253 --> 23:10.122
Stop! Okay, Dor. Dor.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.524
You know I'm ticklish! Stop!

23:16.962 --> 23:18.797
- Oh, my God.

23:21.733 --> 23:22.968
- What is this?

23:23.068 --> 23:24.636
- What is that?

23:24.736 --> 23:26.772
- Why do you have this?

23:28.473 --> 23:30.275
Why do you have this?

23:31.810 --> 23:32.811
- And what kind of woman

23:32.911 --> 23:33.912
are you looking for today?

23:33.979 --> 23:35.647
- Well, uh, I'll tell you,

23:35.747 --> 23:38.116
here's the deal, I-I'm having kind of a bad day.

23:38.216 --> 23:40.585
So I want to employ your services.

23:40.652 --> 23:43.054
It's just the usual, nothing physical.

23:43.121 --> 23:44.790
Um, you know, I lay down on the ground,

23:44.890 --> 23:46.425
as I've said before, and they form

23:46.491 --> 23:47.993
a circle around me and throw out the compliments.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.594
Generally, bucking me up, you know.

23:49.661 --> 23:51.163
- Of course. - Who did this to me?

23:51.263 --> 23:52.464
One of you did this to me.

23:52.564 --> 23:54.266
One of you put this in my pocket.

23:54.332 --> 23:55.834
- Portia,

23:55.934 --> 23:57.135
tell me the truth.

23:57.235 --> 23:58.837
- No, Dory, I am! I am!

23:58.937 --> 24:00.572
I didn't do it, I swear to God, Dory.

24:00.639 --> 24:02.340
It was one of you guys. One of you!

24:02.441 --> 24:04.643
Who did it? Who put it in my pocket?

24:04.743 --> 24:06.344
- Wait.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.847
Did you poison her, Portia?

24:09.948 --> 24:11.016
I would--

24:11.116 --> 24:12.451
Kidding? I would never poison Dory.

24:12.517 --> 24:13.985
We're, like--I'm like--

24:14.085 --> 24:15.287
we're, like, soulmates,

24:15.353 --> 24:16.855
and we're, like, so happy and in love

24:16.955 --> 24:19.424
and having the best fucking sex of our lives.

24:19.491 --> 24:21.793
- What?

24:21.860 --> 24:23.094
- Portia.

24:23.161 --> 24:25.831
- I swear, I swear, I swear. - I knew it!

24:25.931 --> 24:28.133
I knew it. I knew I couldn't trust you.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.435
- What?

24:30.502 --> 24:31.837
How do you have this?

24:31.937 --> 24:33.672
- I went to the Mayflower Asylum, Dory.

24:33.772 --> 24:35.340
All right, I talked to Dr. Flesh.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.042
He told me everything. He told me that you're crazy,

24:37.142 --> 24:39.044
that you basically killed Dr. Lombardo,

24:39.144 --> 24:40.779
and that I can't trust you.

24:40.846 --> 24:42.481
- Wait, wait, wait. What?

24:42.547 --> 24:44.349
Killed Dr. Lombardo?

24:44.449 --> 24:46.785
Dr. Lombardo is dead? - Yes.

24:46.852 --> 24:49.287
Because you encouraged him to kill himself.

24:49.354 --> 24:51.490
- You don't talk to her like that.

24:51.556 --> 24:53.725
- Shut up! Shut up! Shut the fuck up!

24:53.825 --> 24:56.962
- We are now entering the premises in the hopes

24:57.028 --> 25:00.131
of making contact with our captured daughter.

25:00.198 --> 25:03.835
Beautiful Leonora. - Mummy.

25:03.902 --> 25:06.538
What are you doing here?

25:06.638 --> 25:08.673
Oh, my God.

25:08.740 --> 25:09.908
You're embarrassing me!

25:10.008 --> 25:12.744
Stop making documentaries about me!

25:12.844 --> 25:14.579
- Oh, darling, your--

25:14.679 --> 25:16.414
your destroyed face.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.183
Oh, mummy, this is even worse in person.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.851
- Now, pack your bags.

25:19.918 --> 25:21.887
You are coming with us.

25:21.987 --> 25:23.555
- No, I'm not.

25:23.655 --> 25:24.923
both: Yes, you are.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.525
- No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

25:26.591 --> 25:28.026
- I'm sorry, can somebody please

25:28.093 --> 25:29.928
get these, like, foreign intruders out of here?

25:30.028 --> 25:31.363
- Hey, don't deflect, Portia.

25:31.429 --> 25:33.498
You still owe me an explanation.

25:33.565 --> 25:35.400
- You owe an explanation. - Guys, guys, guys.

25:37.235 --> 25:40.038
- Dory, Gemini is alive. - What?

25:40.105 --> 25:41.172
- We did it.

25:41.239 --> 25:44.376
We made enlightenment.

25:53.752 --> 25:56.888
- Um, I don't know why it's so tough to scrape up--

26:04.429 --> 26:06.865
Oh, my goodness.
