08:44.257 --> 08:46.760
Ah, I really wish he'd
watch where he's -- oh.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.261
[ Siren wails ]
Now I guess we know

08:48.295 --> 08:49.763
how he swallowed
the steering wheel.

Look at that glitch!

08:55.502 --> 08:56.737
Yeah, and that one.

08:56.770 --> 08:59.072
Yeah. Glitches.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.540
Um, let's try
somewhere else.

09:00.574 --> 09:03.076
Ooh! I'm so excited.
I've never been on a plane.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.544
What's the view like?

09:04.578 --> 09:07.180
Eh, maybe we should
fly first class next time.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.949
Where are we going
anyway?

09:08.982 --> 09:10.818

no, no, no.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.590
What's wrong, Mrs. Mom?

09:16.624 --> 09:19.392
Maybe we should go some place
where we need clothes.

09:19.426 --> 09:22.195
Oh, wow, I've never
walked on ice before.

Go slowly.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.266
I don't think the ice
can take our weight.

scuba diving either.

is that my fish mom?

Oh, yeah, I can see
the resemblance.

Eww!

to a hospital!

much of the world here.

Okay, let's go
somewhere random.

10:07.607 --> 10:11.645
Ah, Tokyo.
Now let's have a look around.

10:11.679 --> 10:12.980
Maybe over there.

Er, Gumball I don't
think this is Tokyo.

10:14.648 --> 10:15.983
Th-this way. Um...

10:16.016 --> 10:18.151
Gumball, can't you
just admit we're lost?

to find a busy bit.

a little too busy.

Probably 'cause
