Nice.

-(gasps)
-Ooh, sorry.

08:23.377 --> 08:26.085
-I'm sorry.
-That's okay. I'm
just very sensitive.

08:27.585 --> 08:29.752
That was very
sweet, though.

08:32.210 --> 08:35.835
It really smells
like gasoline
when we're idling.

08:35.919 --> 08:38.377
-Is that okay? Okay.
-Yeah, it's fine.

08:38.460 --> 08:40.293
-I can only smell
your drink.
-What?

08:40.377 --> 08:43.085
Whatever that is,
it smells so intense.

08:43.168 --> 08:45.502
-It's just
bone broth.
-Really?

08:45.585 --> 08:47.251
I mean, it might
be the kombu.

08:47.335 --> 08:49.210
Smelly Kapowski
over here.

08:49.293 --> 08:50.919
Hmm?

08:52.251 --> 08:54.502
-You didn't watch
Saved by the Bell  ?
-Mm-mm.

08:54.585 --> 08:56.835
I thought I told you,
I didn't really watch
TV growing up.

08:56.919 --> 08:58.377
(cars honking)

08:58.460 --> 08:59.627
Oh yeah.

08:59.710 --> 09:01.835

09:01.919 --> 09:04.293
(jackhammer rattling)

09:05.585 --> 09:07.293
The Guy:
Here you go.

09:11.460 --> 09:13.126
What's up, man?

09:15.960 --> 09:18.085
(jet engine roaring)

09:28.585 --> 09:30.627
I'm chuffed about this rough.

09:32.335 --> 09:33.543
What?

09:33.627 --> 09:35.960
(laughing):
You look ridiculous.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.043
Oh no, I don't.
I look Holi-dazzling.

09:38.126 --> 09:40.502
Lee:
Yeah, but I told you
it's like winter holidays,

09:40.585 --> 09:42.710
like Christmas,
Kwanza, Hanukkah.

09:43.460 --> 09:46.001
-Lee: It's okay.
You made a mistake.
-The Guy: I don't--

09:46.085 --> 09:48.168
Well, maybe I made
a mistake.

09:49.835 --> 09:52.710
-Oh, wow.
-Hi, honey!

09:53.377 --> 09:57.251
-AJ: It's so nice of you
to sneak into the city.
-That's how I deal with it.

09:57.335 --> 10:01.085
Of all of the Holidazzles
in all of the houseboats...

10:01.168 --> 10:03.168
Nice to see you, too.

10:04.001 --> 10:05.919
Lee, you remember Jules?

10:06.001 --> 10:08.543
Yeah, we've met,
at the park on
Memorial Day.

10:08.627 --> 10:10.377
-My birthday thing.
-Totally, yep.

10:10.460 --> 10:12.418
Sorry, I have, like,
face aphasia.

10:12.502 --> 10:14.293
-Or something.
-Face aphasia?

10:14.377 --> 10:16.251
That's my favorite
movie as a kid.

10:16.335 --> 10:19.669
I'm AJ. How do you guys
know each other?

10:19.752 --> 10:21.960
Uh, well...

10:22.043 --> 10:23.585
-through marriage.
-Yeah, our marriage.

10:23.669 --> 10:25.418
Oh hey,
you're the guy.

10:25.502 --> 10:27.043
That's me. Nice
to meet you, AJ.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.960
Nice to meet you.
I'm digging the sexy Pilgrim.

10:29.043 --> 10:31.585
-So out of the box.
-I mean, it's in the box.

10:31.669 --> 10:34.210
It's Thanksgiving.
It's Holidazzle.

10:34.293 --> 10:36.794
This is very
uncomfortable for me.

10:36.877 --> 10:38.710
This is a reverse
Mayflower situation.

10:38.794 --> 10:40.460
I'm being persecuted
on a boat.

10:40.543 --> 10:42.126
You just gotta
roll into it.

10:42.210 --> 10:44.126
(both laughing)

10:44.210 --> 10:45.418
-Is Blaine here?
-Yeah.

10:45.502 --> 10:47.126
I think I saw him
in the captain's quarters.

10:47.210 --> 10:49.210
-Oh, you have
to meet Blaine.
-Oh, yeah.

10:49.293 --> 10:51.377
Oh, we have so much
to catch up on later,
my dear.

10:51.460 --> 10:53.960
-Top of my dance card.
-Good to see you, Julie.

10:54.043 --> 10:55.627
(quietly):
It-It's Jules.

10:55.710 --> 10:57.460
Bye, Julie.
See you around.

10:57.543 --> 10:59.669
-Her name is Jules.
-What's that?

11:03.710 --> 11:06.794
(chattering)

11:06.877 --> 11:09.502
(laughing)

11:13.710 --> 11:15.085
So how you been?

11:16.460 --> 11:18.085
Hey, brother.

11:28.210 --> 11:31.168
Hey, Sofia Mia,
where you been all day?

11:31.251 --> 11:32.710
Around.

11:32.794 --> 11:34.251
Sof! You gotta come
check this out.

11:34.335 --> 11:35.752
We're going
digital this year.

11:35.835 --> 11:37.669
I'll be able to control
the fireworks with my laptop.

11:37.752 --> 11:39.877
The Guy:
Yeah, well, it's
not your business

11:39.960 --> 11:42.001
what anybody thinks
of you, you know?

11:42.085 --> 11:44.001
And these are
your friends, but...

11:44.085 --> 11:46.794
I just don't think anyone's
judging you. I really don't.

11:46.877 --> 11:48.543
Yeah, but it's
impossible to know.

11:48.627 --> 11:51.085
Yeah, so why
even try to figure out
what they're thinking?

11:51.168 --> 11:53.627
-You'll never know.
-(knocking)

11:55.293 --> 11:57.585
-(Lee groaning)
-It's okay.

11:57.669 --> 11:59.043
Okay. It's okay?

11:59.126 --> 12:01.168
-Yeah.
-Yeah, it's okay.
I'm okay.

12:01.251 --> 12:03.710
-Oh, hey. How are ya?
-Jules: Hey. Is this a bad time?

12:03.794 --> 12:05.669
Uh...

12:05.752 --> 12:08.335
Yeah...
Yeah, come on in.

12:10.669 --> 12:12.960
-Welcome!
-It's very nice.

12:13.043 --> 12:14.460
Well, thank you.

12:14.543 --> 12:15.710
-Hi.
-Hey.

12:15.794 --> 12:17.460
-Want this?
-Yes, please.

12:17.543 --> 12:18.877
There you go.

12:18.960 --> 12:22.126
-My fucking therapist
is in there.
-The Guy: Oh, no.

12:23.835 --> 12:27.210
Yeah, she just
stared at me.

12:27.293 --> 12:30.835
-I wanted to stop seeing her...
-Yes, please.

12:30.919 --> 12:31.919
...and I didn't
know how,

12:32.001 --> 12:34.960
and she made it
so fucking hard,

12:35.043 --> 12:38.001
so I just stopped returning
her calls and e-mails.

12:38.085 --> 12:39.669
Yeah, she might be
mad about that.

12:39.752 --> 12:42.669
-Yeah, she just stared
at me, stared.
-Lee: Mm.

12:42.752 --> 12:45.293
Therapists aren't allowed
to acknowledge their
clients in public.

12:45.377 --> 12:46.627
You have to say hi first.

12:46.710 --> 12:48.251
-Huh.
-Yeah.

12:48.335 --> 12:49.585
Like a vampire.

12:49.669 --> 12:51.335
The Guy (Eastern European
accent): Yeah, like wampire!

12:51.418 --> 12:52.877
(in same accent):
Ah, yes, like wampire.

12:52.960 --> 12:56.210
(in same accent):
Ha-ha-ha.
You are my client,

12:56.293 --> 12:58.627
and you're my--
Why'd it become Jamaican?

12:58.710 --> 13:00.126
Hey! What's going
on in here?

13:00.210 --> 13:02.543
Hey, we're taking a little
break from the party.

13:02.627 --> 13:05.293
Oh, cool. I'm gonna
make a beer run.

13:05.377 --> 13:07.335
-I'll go with you.
-No! Stay here with me!

13:07.418 --> 13:08.919
We haven't had
a chance to catch up yet.

13:09.001 --> 13:12.752
You know what?
I can take the RV,
much quicker to get beer.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.251
Uh, or, you know,
I also like to walk.

13:15.335 --> 13:17.126
It's a nice day.
I'd like to walk.

13:17.210 --> 13:19.085
-I'll go get the beer.
-You sure?

13:19.168 --> 13:21.460
-Oh, yeah. Let's walk.
-I will go with you.

13:21.543 --> 13:22.960
-The Guy:
Really? All right.
-Yeah.

13:23.043 --> 13:24.293
You okay?

13:24.377 --> 13:26.001
-Yeah.
-Okay.

13:27.293 --> 13:29.877
Oh, yeah. For the road.

13:34.168 --> 13:35.710
The Guy:
It's just a mole.

13:35.794 --> 13:37.293
The derm-y did
call it a cancer,

13:37.377 --> 13:39.210
but it's not,
like, cancer.

13:39.293 --> 13:42.377
-It's just like, they got it.
It's taken care of.
-Shit.

13:42.460 --> 13:44.460
-Okay.
-Don't worry about it.

13:44.543 --> 13:47.543
-So you're gonna go
to the doctor regularly, right?
-I did go to the doctor.

13:47.627 --> 13:48.877
I go to the doctor
regularly.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.710
I'm an adult,
I do all sorts of things.

13:50.794 --> 13:52.251
-Okay, man,
I'm just saying--
-I pay taxes.

13:52.335 --> 13:55.085
-I know how to use Windows 95.
-You have to take care

13:55.168 --> 13:58.251
-of yourself, okay?
-Yeah, that's true.

13:58.335 --> 13:59.710
I do take care
of myself, though.

13:59.794 --> 14:01.835
Every morning I make
my own nut milk,

14:01.919 --> 14:04.043
and I drink it
with collagen,

14:04.126 --> 14:05.669
-Maca root...
-Wow!

14:05.752 --> 14:07.752
-Burpies...
-Okay.

14:07.835 --> 14:11.085
-Yoga...
-Oh, damn. Okay!

14:11.168 --> 14:14.001
Lee's got you on
that wellness tip.

14:14.085 --> 14:15.627
It's true.

14:15.710 --> 14:17.877
Well...

14:17.960 --> 14:20.085
..."ness" tip.

14:21.251 --> 14:22.669
(both chuckling)

14:22.752 --> 14:24.794
-That was so stupid.
That was not--
-I don't know, man.

14:24.877 --> 14:26.752
That was not
my best.

14:30.877 --> 14:32.377
That's great, man.

14:34.293 --> 14:37.460
It seems like it's all
working out for you.

14:40.460 --> 14:42.960
So, you know I can tell
when you don't like somebody.

14:43.043 --> 14:45.919
-I didn't say that--
-I know you didn't
say it, but I can tell.

14:46.001 --> 14:48.293
No, I am not saying
that I don't like her.

14:48.377 --> 14:50.794
-Okay.
-I think it's
a little weird

14:50.877 --> 14:53.001
that she defended him.

14:53.085 --> 14:55.043
-That's all
I'm saying.
-Yeah, but...

14:55.126 --> 14:56.960
you and I both know
that's a tricky situation.

14:57.043 --> 15:00.251
Absolutely. No one's saying
anything to the contrary.

15:01.460 --> 15:03.293
-Never mind.
-She left him.

15:04.585 --> 15:06.251
After she made excuses
for his behavior.

15:06.335 --> 15:08.126
-Okay, well, that--
-That's all I'm saying.

15:08.210 --> 15:11.210
-The heart wants
what the heart wants.
-Uh-uh.

15:11.293 --> 15:13.669
Oh, that's
a Woody Allen quote.
Oops.

15:13.752 --> 15:15.669
(both laughing)

15:15.752 --> 15:18.168
-Sorry.
-Well, it's...

15:20.001 --> 15:22.919
It's... It's fine,
you know?

15:23.001 --> 15:25.669
It just seems like
it could get messy.

15:26.669 --> 15:28.001
You know what I mean?

15:32.502 --> 15:35.210
Yeah, Messy Spano.

15:35.293 --> 15:37.377
(both laughing)

15:40.168 --> 15:42.085
-That's a good one.
-Yeah, it's a good one.

15:52.877 --> 15:54.835

15:56.085 --> 15:58.418
-Hi.
-There she is.

15:58.502 --> 16:00.085
We got lost.

16:00.168 --> 16:02.919
-AJ: That's all right.
-It wasn't too much
of a trouble, was it?

16:03.001 --> 16:06.710
-Oh, no.
We had a nice time.
-It was fantastic.

16:07.752 --> 16:09.877
-Do you want a drink?
-Yeah, what are you making?

16:09.960 --> 16:12.752
Um, I think
you'll like it.

16:12.835 --> 16:15.835
It's called
a Reverse Mayflower.

16:15.919 --> 16:18.043
Oh, yes. I respond
to this kind of humor.

16:18.126 --> 16:20.627
-Yeah. I thought you would.
-Yeah, it's a callback.

16:20.710 --> 16:22.960
-Bringing it
back for ya.
-Thanks.

16:23.043 --> 16:24.335
You guys seen Lee?

16:25.627 --> 16:27.126
What did you
do to her?

16:27.210 --> 16:29.460
Just told her
a sad, sad story.

16:29.543 --> 16:31.251
(AJ laughing)

16:31.335 --> 16:33.043
-Later, baby.
-Bye!

16:33.126 --> 16:34.710
The Guy:
I guess it's my hang-up.

16:34.794 --> 16:37.835
I'm not into
the Irish goodbye
or French exit or whatever.

16:37.919 --> 16:41.168
Lee:
They probably think
we already left.

16:41.251 --> 16:43.335
Think these fireworks
are gonna happen?

16:43.418 --> 16:45.043
I don't know.

16:47.543 --> 16:50.210
I don't know, I mean,
do you wanna just go?

16:51.710 --> 16:52.960
(sighs)

16:53.043 --> 16:55.460
Do you wanna go?
I don't-- I don't care.

16:57.669 --> 16:59.794
Let's just go, yeah?

17:01.335 --> 17:03.335
All right. Okay.

17:03.418 --> 17:05.460
Will you secure
the stuff down?

17:05.543 --> 17:07.293
-Yeah.
-Okay.

17:15.085 --> 17:18.210
(engine chugging)

17:22.126 --> 17:25.043
Do you want me
to call a car?

17:25.126 --> 17:26.669
Shit. Give me a second.

17:26.752 --> 17:29.126
(engine chugging)

17:32.168 --> 17:35.001
-I'm gonna call a car.
-All right, let's call
a car, fine.

17:35.085 --> 17:37.377
Bill:
Matty, you didn't check to make
sure you had what you needed?

17:37.460 --> 17:39.919
You can't remember
to bring the fucking cord?

17:40.001 --> 17:42.293
I thought I brought it!
I'm sorry!

17:42.377 --> 17:45.210
Uncle Bobby:
Just send someone back to
the house to get the dongle.

17:45.293 --> 17:48.585
-Bill: Good fucking luck!
-I knew we shouldn't have
switched to computers.

17:48.669 --> 17:50.669
What was wrong
with the old-fashioned way?

17:50.752 --> 17:53.043
Bill:
You fucked us, Matty.
We're fucked.

17:53.126 --> 17:55.669
You know this show ain't
happening until we get
that fucking dongle.

18:15.001 --> 18:16.251
I need a dongle.

18:16.335 --> 18:18.627
-No, no. That one.
-This?

18:45.085 --> 18:47.710
Sofia, oh my God, yes!

18:47.794 --> 18:49.960
Hey, everybody, hold up!
Sofia got the dongle!

18:50.043 --> 18:51.460

19:14.710 --> 19:18.335
-Want to switch seats with me?
-I think I get the picture.

19:20.585 --> 19:23.877
Excuse me, do you have
the little cord thing?

19:23.960 --> 19:25.335
I can play my own music?

19:25.418 --> 19:28.669
-The dongle.
-The dongle.
Thank you.
