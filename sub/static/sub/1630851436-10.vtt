00:08.283 --> 00:09.851
- Tom, take this the right way,

00:09.918 --> 00:12.754
but I'ma put some feelers out
for a new lab partner.

00:12.854 --> 00:14.256
- Why, you're not happy
with the volcano?

00:14.356 --> 00:15.857
- No,
it look like a pile of manure!

00:15.924 --> 00:17.392
It don't even erupt.
- You know what?

00:17.459 --> 00:18.560
I grabbed some
extra stuff from home.

00:18.627 --> 00:19.628
Let's see if this works.

00:19.728 --> 00:21.263
- What you got? What you got?

00:21.363 --> 00:23.531
- We got blackberry brandy,
windshield washer fluid,

00:23.598 --> 00:25.567
and mountain breeze
air freshener.

00:25.634 --> 00:26.968
- Okay.
- That's gotta burn, right?

00:27.068 --> 00:28.370
- We can work with this.
- Right?

00:28.436 --> 00:29.871
- Put these on.
- Nice.

00:29.938 --> 00:31.306
- I'll stand
at a safe distance.

00:31.406 --> 00:32.874
You start dumping things
until it explodes.

00:32.941 --> 00:34.476
- Why am I doing all the work
on this team?

00:34.576 --> 00:36.478
I built the volcano.
- Tom, we've been over this.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.281
I'm the scientist.
You're the unskilled laborer.

00:39.381 --> 00:41.149
Now start dumping.
- Okay, step back.

00:41.249 --> 00:42.918
Let me show you
how science works.

00:42.984 --> 00:45.153
A couple fluid ounces of this.

00:45.253 --> 00:46.554
Brandy.

00:46.621 --> 00:48.556
That's weird.
It's not erupting.

00:48.623 --> 00:50.458
- Here, here.
Let's do this the Nelson way.

00:50.558 --> 00:52.294
Oh. Whoa.
- Oh, no! Oh, no, flames!

00:52.394 --> 00:53.762
Oh, no, what's happening?
Oh, no!

00:53.828 --> 00:55.497
Everybody run!
Run for your lives!

00:55.597 --> 00:58.333
We're all gonna die!

00:58.433 --> 01:01.469
- Is nobody gonna put out
the stupid volcano thing--

01:01.569 --> 01:03.638
Okay. I guess I'll do it.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.277
- Hey, hey, kids.

01:09.344 --> 01:11.680
Your principal called me in
to talk about fire safety.

01:11.780 --> 01:14.182
Now, I know I'm not supposed
to curse in front of you,

01:14.282 --> 01:16.017
but who knows what a pussy is?

01:16.117 --> 01:18.820
- Um, a person like Tom?
- What?

01:18.920 --> 01:21.189
- Exactly. Come here, buddy.
This little guy right here.

01:21.289 --> 01:22.857
- Oh, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- He saw the flames.

01:22.958 --> 01:23.925
- Oh, no--
- And he ran.

01:23.992 --> 01:25.193
- You got it all wrong.

01:25.293 --> 01:26.594
I ran to get
the fire extinguisher.

01:26.661 --> 01:28.029
I'm a hero.
- You fled the scene.

01:28.129 --> 01:29.664
- I fled out of bravery
to save everyone.

01:29.764 --> 01:31.099
I fled to save.

01:31.166 --> 01:32.500
- You think that's
what Superman does?

01:32.600 --> 01:34.035
You think Superman flies away
for a bit

01:34.135 --> 01:35.470
and then comes back to save?

01:35.537 --> 01:36.705
- I'm sure he does
all kind of things.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.373
- Horrible person. Look at him.

01:38.473 --> 01:41.943
Yasmine here, she ran
to the flames and saved lives.

01:42.010 --> 01:43.878
Hero.

01:43.979 --> 01:46.114
- Guys, come on, we--

01:46.181 --> 01:47.615
all right,
tell the dog to relax.

01:47.682 --> 01:49.784
She literally poured
iced tea on a volcano.

01:49.851 --> 01:51.286
- Excuse me?

01:51.353 --> 01:53.121
- I'm just saying,
hero might be a strong word.

01:53.188 --> 01:54.556
I mean, let's--
- Where I come from,

01:54.656 --> 01:56.858
we have respect
for first responders.

01:56.958 --> 01:58.960
- I don't know if I'd call her
a first responder. She's--

01:59.027 --> 02:00.328
- Now you're
being disrespectful.

02:00.395 --> 02:01.963
You gotta leave the truck area.

02:02.030 --> 02:03.298
- She took two steps.

02:03.365 --> 02:04.632
I don't wanna leave
the truck area.

02:05.667 --> 02:06.835
- Say you're sorry,

02:06.901 --> 02:08.370
and then get
the fuck outta here.

02:08.470 --> 02:10.905
- How is there no teacher
out here to supervise us?

02:12.140 --> 02:13.675
- Tom, before you
do these things,

02:13.742 --> 02:16.644
you need to ask yourself,
how will this affect Nelson?

02:16.711 --> 02:18.079
- I know. I shouldn't have run.

02:18.179 --> 02:20.081
I shouldn't have
run and screeched.

02:20.181 --> 02:23.018
- Come on, you old piece
of pain in the tush!

02:23.084 --> 02:24.853
Ah, sorry for
the language kids,

02:24.919 --> 02:26.588
but I can't get
this thing into gear.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.724
Mother-bleeping C-word!
Stupid B-hole bus.

02:29.824 --> 02:32.594
Get that heinie into gear,
you piece of caca!

02:32.694 --> 02:34.262
- I don't think these
kid-friendly curses

02:34.362 --> 02:35.730
are really landing.

02:35.830 --> 02:38.500
- Ill rip your ding-a-ling off,
you GD bus!

02:41.269 --> 02:42.771
Okay, kids, stand back.

02:42.871 --> 02:46.041
I'm igniting
a common safety flare.

02:46.107 --> 02:48.243
- Whoa.
- Whoa, no need to panic, Tom!

02:48.343 --> 02:50.945
- Panic? I-I literally said
whoa in a deadpan voice.

02:51.046 --> 02:52.180
- No, Tom panicked.

02:52.247 --> 02:53.615
- I didn't panic.
I'm not panicking.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.884
- Don't flee the scene, Tom.

02:55.950 --> 02:57.252
- This is the opposite
of fleeing.

02:57.352 --> 02:58.887
I'm literally standing here.

02:58.953 --> 03:00.622
- Okay, kids,
you stay here by the bus.

03:00.722 --> 03:01.956
Try not to get shot.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.792
Tom, hold this flare.
Come over here.

03:03.892 --> 03:05.794
- Okay, more fire. What's up?

03:05.894 --> 03:06.961
- Here's the deal.

03:07.062 --> 03:08.630
I need a new bus.
- Okay.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.533
- And you need an opportunity
to look like a hero.

03:11.599 --> 03:13.368
- I do need that.

03:13.435 --> 03:14.736
- So tomorrow morning,

03:14.803 --> 03:17.639
we fake an emergency
on the school bus.

03:17.739 --> 03:18.940
- Fake emergency? No.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.975
the bus explodes.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.243
You come running in.

03:22.310 --> 03:23.478
- I don't like to run.

03:23.578 --> 03:25.647
- You haul my ass
out of the bus.

03:25.747 --> 03:27.315
Everyone will think
you're a hero,

03:27.415 --> 03:28.817
and I'll have a new vehicle.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.486
- That sounds abnormally dicey.
- Trust me.

03:31.586 --> 03:32.987
I know a guy
who could rig it all up.

03:33.088 --> 03:34.656
I mean, we're good.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.958
- Wow, you know a guy who does
fake school bus explosions?

03:37.058 --> 03:37.992
That's amazing.

03:39.894 --> 03:41.596
- Oh, what's up, player?
I remember you.

03:41.663 --> 03:43.431
- This is the guy? Glenn?
- Hell yeah.

03:43.498 --> 03:45.166
- Oh, you know each other?
- You don't remember

03:45.266 --> 03:46.968
he sold me drugs
and I shoved them up my butt

03:47.068 --> 03:48.837
and there was a whole scandal?
- Yes!

03:48.937 --> 03:50.405
- Anyway, so you know
what you're doing here?

03:50.472 --> 03:53.174
You can help
with the fake fire and smoke?

03:53.274 --> 03:55.343
- Does a cat have six tits?
- Six tits?

03:55.443 --> 03:57.011
I have no idea.
Not a cat owner.

03:57.112 --> 03:58.613
- Boom.
- Oh, wow. Look at that.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.648
- Worked on a Michael Bay
picture back in the day.

04:00.748 --> 04:02.283
So I know my way
around special effects.

04:02.350 --> 04:03.518
- This is impressive stuff.

04:03.618 --> 04:04.652
You rigged
all these explosions?

04:04.752 --> 04:06.087
- Hell yeah, dude.

04:06.154 --> 04:07.522
Renaissance man and shit,
you know what I'm saying?

04:07.622 --> 04:09.090
I'm all the ninja turtles
wrapped into one.

04:09.157 --> 04:11.192
- He's a wizard, Tom.
- You know what's up.

04:11.292 --> 04:13.027
So anyway,
here's the plan, dawg.

04:13.128 --> 04:15.530
I'll rig the bus
with harmless movie smoke.

04:15.630 --> 04:16.931
- Nice.
- And on my cue,

04:16.998 --> 04:18.533
the driver screams,
"Run for your lives.

04:18.633 --> 04:20.602
This bitch is gonna blow."
That's what's up.

04:20.668 --> 04:22.537
- I question some
of the dialogue, but--

04:22.637 --> 04:25.006
- Anyway, so then Tom says,
"Not on my watch.

04:25.106 --> 04:26.474
First responder
coming through."

04:26.541 --> 04:27.876
- I like that.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.477
- Then Tom drags you out,
and I'll be playing

04:29.544 --> 04:31.279
some type of Aerosmith song
in the background.

04:31.346 --> 04:34.382
Boom. Credits roll.
Any questions, gentlemen?

04:34.482 --> 04:35.984
- Zero questions.

04:36.050 --> 04:37.352
- Let's just hope for the best.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.524
- This is Cobra,
your eyes on the ground, over.

04:42.624 --> 04:44.826
- This is Stallion.
Radio check, over.

04:44.893 --> 04:47.061
<i>- This is Tom.
Radio check, over.</i>

04:47.161 --> 04:49.030
<i>- Tom, use the code names,
remember?</i>

04:49.130 --> 04:51.499
I'm Cobra. He's Stallion.
You're Louise.

04:51.566 --> 04:53.034
- I feel like I got
the worst nickname.

04:53.134 --> 04:55.336
Can I say that?
- Please identify yourself.

04:55.403 --> 04:58.840
- Louise in position, over.
<i>- Thank you.</i>

04:58.907 --> 05:00.475
All right, guys, it's go time.

05:00.542 --> 05:02.744
And in the off chance
the bus does actually explode

05:02.844 --> 05:04.846
and everyone dies,
that's my bad.

05:04.913 --> 05:06.981
I apologize in advance.

05:09.651 --> 05:12.720
- Help, I'm stuck!
The bus is gonna blow!

05:12.820 --> 05:15.390
- Oh, my God, someone's gotta
help the bus driver.

05:15.490 --> 05:16.991
- Everyone, relax.

05:17.058 --> 05:19.160
You're in good hands.
First responder's on the scene.

05:19.227 --> 05:22.363
<i>- ♪ When a hero comes along ♪</i>

05:22.430 --> 05:25.433
<i>♪ And saves a life today ♪</i>

05:25.533 --> 05:27.335
- Tom just ran into the bus!

05:27.402 --> 05:28.937
- Is this really happening?

05:29.037 --> 05:32.607
- Who is playing this music?
It is fucking perfect!

05:32.707 --> 05:35.009
<i>- ♪ When a hero comes along ♪</i>

05:35.076 --> 05:36.911
<i>♪ You will not forget ♪</i>

05:37.011 --> 05:39.414
- He's alive!
Are you seeing this?

05:39.514 --> 05:42.016
- Whoo, this little guy
saved my life.

05:42.083 --> 05:43.618
Thank you, Tom.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.520
- You know what, Tom?
You're a hero.

05:45.587 --> 05:47.188
- Please, please.
Don't call me a hero.

05:47.255 --> 05:49.557
It's just what I do.
I run towards fire.

05:49.624 --> 05:51.593
I run towards fire and flames.

05:53.061 --> 05:54.896
- Look at that article.
- Thanks, Mom.

05:54.963 --> 05:56.431
This--this is amazing.

05:56.531 --> 05:57.966
- Well, I wanted to treat you
to something nice.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.368
This is big.
I'm, like, an A-list mom now.

06:00.435 --> 06:03.538
- But the hero's mom is usually
not the focus of the story.

06:03.605 --> 06:04.973
- Well, it should be

06:05.073 --> 06:06.541
'cause the hero had to come
out of the mom.

06:06.608 --> 06:08.810
- Hey, hope you folks
enjoyed your meal.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.879
We are so grateful
for what your son did.

06:11.946 --> 06:13.715
Can I have everyone's
attention, please?

06:13.781 --> 06:14.882
- What are you--what are you--

06:14.949 --> 06:16.985
- My dad, God rest his soul,

06:17.085 --> 06:20.154
was a first responder
like this young man here.

06:20.255 --> 06:22.457
He performed many heroic acts.

06:22.557 --> 06:23.958
Saved an old lady
in a kayak once.

06:24.058 --> 06:25.393
- That's amazing.

06:25.460 --> 06:27.562
- Pulled multiple cats
from trees--

06:27.629 --> 06:29.163
- Multiple cats?

06:29.264 --> 06:32.767
- But he tragically died while
trying to deep fry a turkey.

06:32.834 --> 06:33.835
- Oh, what a story.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.336
- So as a tribute to him,

06:35.436 --> 06:38.973
we'd like to offer Tom
free meals for life.

06:39.073 --> 06:40.008
- Wow.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.776
- That's amazing. Thank you.

06:41.843 --> 06:43.945
- This is for you, Dad.
- Oh, my God.

06:44.012 --> 06:45.580
Can my mom eat free too?
- Well...

06:45.647 --> 06:47.248
- Yes, we'll extend it
to the whole family.

06:47.315 --> 06:49.584
- Oh, wow!
How about Nelson? Nelson too?

06:49.651 --> 06:51.152
- Is he family?
Who's this Nelson?

06:51.252 --> 06:52.620
- He's more of a friend,
but, you know--

06:52.687 --> 06:54.088
- We'll discuss it.
- He's in.

06:54.155 --> 06:55.857
We'll make it a friends
and family deal.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.525
We'll even name a dish
after you.

06:57.625 --> 06:58.960
Anything you want.

06:59.027 --> 07:00.595
- Something cheap.
Like, a hot dog, maybe?

07:00.662 --> 07:02.330
- How about something fancy?

07:02.430 --> 07:05.333
Why don't you carve a bust
of Tom's head out of meat...

07:05.433 --> 07:07.201
- Wait, what?
- Drench it in gravy,

07:07.302 --> 07:08.503
and then light it on fire.

07:08.603 --> 07:10.972
- That sounds
insanely expensive.

07:11.039 --> 07:13.341
- In memory of Dad,
consider it done.

07:15.643 --> 07:18.546
- Kids, I hope you're enjoying
the new B3000

07:18.646 --> 07:21.316
and the fact
that Tom saved my life.

07:21.382 --> 07:23.384
Tom, say a few words.

07:23.484 --> 07:26.187
- Hi, glad I could save
everyone's lives

07:26.287 --> 07:27.555
and get us a sweet new bus.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.223
I know I put
Yasmine's rescue to shame,

07:29.324 --> 07:31.893
but hey, it's not
a competition, so thank you.

07:31.993 --> 07:33.728
- I heard you get free food
at the diner.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.396
Can we get in on that?
- Sorry, Hector.

07:35.496 --> 07:37.065
It's just friends
and family, so...

07:37.165 --> 07:39.300
- Wait, are we not friends?
- Friends?

07:39.367 --> 07:41.402
I mean, more bus mates.

07:41.502 --> 07:44.305
- So we're all just
nameless faces on a bus?

07:44.372 --> 07:45.473
Wow.

07:45.540 --> 07:46.741
- Oh, hey. Stop. Stop.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.976
- Eat this, Tom!

07:49.043 --> 07:50.411
- Tom, you're losing
the crowd, man.

07:50.511 --> 07:51.813
Tell 'em what they wanna hear.

07:51.879 --> 07:53.481
- All right, you know what?
Fine.

07:53.548 --> 07:55.683
If you go to the diner,
just tell 'em Tom sent you.

07:57.185 --> 08:00.088
- Hi, I'd like to order
the Tom Special,

08:00.188 --> 08:01.489
and can I get that for free?

08:01.556 --> 08:03.691
'Cause my best friend
Tom sent me.

08:03.758 --> 08:05.593
- Can I get a flaming
meat things for free?

08:05.693 --> 08:07.228
Yeah, I'm friends
with the little dude

08:07.328 --> 08:08.896
who did the thing with the bus.

08:08.996 --> 08:10.732
Yeah, I'm also friends
with Michael Bay, no big deal.

08:10.832 --> 08:14.402
- Hi, I'm friends with Tom
and I'm also a first responder.

08:14.502 --> 08:15.770
I put out a volcano.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.740
And so I'd like
a Tom Special for free.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.443
So that's a dozen Tom Specials.

08:22.543 --> 08:23.911
All for free.
- Yep.

08:24.011 --> 08:25.446
- Since these people
are friends and family.

08:25.546 --> 08:28.049
- And Mountain Dews
all around, baby.

08:28.116 --> 08:29.450
-
- Thank you.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.386
You guys are very generous.

08:31.452 --> 08:32.954
Kinda like royalty
in this place.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.856
The king of the diner.
They treat me nice.

08:34.922 --> 08:38.126
- I can't believe this weasel
keeps coming in.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.761
He brought ten friends, Pete.

08:39.861 --> 08:41.896
- She talking about me?
- Well, we did make the offer.

08:41.963 --> 08:45.400
- He's double-fisting the most
expensive things on the menu.

08:45.466 --> 08:46.934
- Double-fisting?
- Calm down, honey.

08:47.034 --> 08:49.036
- Let's just hope
he unexpectedly dies

08:49.103 --> 08:50.304
or moves out of town.

08:50.405 --> 08:51.806
- Wow, Tom. Oof.

08:51.906 --> 08:53.875
Man, you really screwing over
these nice people.

08:53.941 --> 08:57.211
- She's much friendlier
when she's taking the orders.

08:57.278 --> 08:59.280
- I can't believe this is free!

08:59.380 --> 09:00.648
10 pounds of meat

09:00.748 --> 09:02.316
carved into the shape
of your son's head?

09:02.417 --> 09:04.986
- Hey, those are the perks
of having a hero son.

09:05.086 --> 09:07.155
- Oh, hey, Ma.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.489
What the hell is going on here?

09:08.589 --> 09:10.425
- I started
a Free Food Snack Club

09:10.491 --> 09:11.926
for some of the moms.

09:11.993 --> 09:13.661
- What? All right.
You know what? That does it.

09:13.761 --> 09:15.563
We need to cut this off.
Everybody out.

09:15.630 --> 09:18.266
Party's over.
Donate the meat to somebody.

09:18.332 --> 09:19.967
- Ladies, excuse me
for a second.

09:20.067 --> 09:21.402
I'm gonna go talk to my son.

09:21.469 --> 09:23.337
He seems to be
having a breakdown.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.072
Hey, what are you doing?

09:25.139 --> 09:27.742
- Cindy, can you cut off
a chunk of Tom's face for me?

09:28.576 --> 09:30.812
- You're gonna come in here
and boss your mom? Uh-uh.

09:30.912 --> 09:33.014
- I just don't wanna take
advantage of this poor couple.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.515
I mean--
- That's real sweet.

09:34.615 --> 09:35.750
Is that what you want me
to tell you right now?

09:35.817 --> 09:37.351
You're a good person.

09:37.452 --> 09:38.853
- I don't want to be the reason
they go out of business.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.955
- Ugh, all right.
You know what? Fine.

09:41.022 --> 09:43.324
If you want to end this,
I have a solution.

09:46.027 --> 09:47.361
Ah, thanks for seeing us.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.997
That blurb you wrote
on my son was very nice.

09:50.097 --> 09:51.966
- Well, you got a very brave
young man here.

09:52.033 --> 09:53.701
- Tell her
what you wanna do, Tom.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.303
- You know, a lot of people
are taking advantage

09:55.369 --> 09:56.971
of the diner's free food offer.

09:57.038 --> 09:59.807
So I just wanna put out
a county-wide alert that says,

09:59.874 --> 10:01.375
"Tom wants you
to knock it off."

10:01.476 --> 10:05.179
- Well, it's no bus rescue,
but it is a nice gesture.

10:05.279 --> 10:06.781
I'll put something
in the next issue.

10:06.848 --> 10:07.982
It'll be out in two weeks.

10:08.049 --> 10:09.383
- Oh, no,
we can't wait two weeks.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.052
No, these people
are hemorrhaging money.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.287
- I'm sorry.
The paper's biweekly.

10:13.354 --> 10:14.989
And I know
biweekly is confusing,

10:15.056 --> 10:17.058
but it's the type
where it's two times a month.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.860
- You know what?
They'll be fine for two weeks.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.194
Tom wants to do
the right thing,

10:20.294 --> 10:22.129
but he also wants that blurb.

10:22.196 --> 10:24.665
My boy likes his blurbs,
you know?

10:28.135 --> 10:29.637
Pete, this has gone too far.

10:29.704 --> 10:30.738
We have to rescind the offer.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.740
- Amanda, I gave Tom my word.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.375
I can't just dishonor
my father like that.

10:34.475 --> 10:35.743
- I'm going through
these receipts.

10:35.843 --> 10:37.178
We're going out of business.

10:37.245 --> 10:38.579
- What do you mean,
we're going out business?

10:38.679 --> 10:41.916
- Just the gravy is $15,000.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.652
- I cannot rescind this offer,
Amanda.

10:44.719 --> 10:47.421
It's for my father, who died.

10:47.522 --> 10:49.090
-
If that's how you feel.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.591
There's only one other option.

10:50.691 --> 10:53.094
- Change the beef
to some type of hot dog meat?

10:53.194 --> 10:55.162
- No, I was thinking
burn down the restaurant

10:55.229 --> 10:57.365
and collect
the insurance money.

10:57.431 --> 11:00.167
- Wow, you really
take things too far.

11:01.068 --> 11:03.037
- Tom, this is
your best blurb yet.

11:03.104 --> 11:05.106
- It's pretty good.
- Read it to me.

11:05.206 --> 11:08.609
- "A local boy named Tom
has graciously declined

11:08.709 --> 11:11.212
"to accept free food
at a local restaurant.

11:11.279 --> 11:14.782
"When asked if he sees himself
as a hero, Tom boasted,

11:14.882 --> 11:17.618
'Abso-freaking-lutely.
It's what I do.'"

11:17.718 --> 11:20.621
- As a mom, this is what
it's all about, Tommy.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.390
- This was worth the wait,
I gotta say.

11:27.361 --> 11:29.530
Are you sure we can't
just refinance or something?

11:29.597 --> 11:31.132
- Pete,
I already started the fire.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.601
Now is not the time.

11:33.701 --> 11:35.770
- Hey.
- Hey, we're kinda busy here.

11:35.870 --> 11:38.072
- Oh, no, don't worry.
I'm not here for free food.

11:38.139 --> 11:39.640
I actually have great news.

11:39.740 --> 11:41.776
- "Local hero graciously stops
accepting handouts,

11:41.876 --> 11:44.779
asks friends to repay diner
for free meals"?

11:44.879 --> 11:46.047
That's amazing!

11:46.113 --> 11:47.248
But why didn't
you tell us sooner?

11:47.315 --> 11:48.816
- Oh, Tom wanted to get a blurb

11:48.916 --> 11:50.618
in the local paper,
and it's biweekly.

11:50.718 --> 11:53.988
- It would have helped to have
this information sooner.

11:54.088 --> 11:55.623
- Wait, what--what is that?
Is that smoke?

11:55.723 --> 11:57.925
- Tom, run in and get
the fire extinguisher.

11:57.992 --> 11:59.160
- Me? No.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.728
- Of course you.
- Wait.

12:00.795 --> 12:02.563
- What happened
to your courage? Get in there!

12:02.630 --> 12:03.931
- That was a bus.
This is a diner.

12:03.998 --> 12:05.333
It's a whole
different interface.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.767
- Just go in there and save it

12:06.834 --> 12:08.269
just like you saved
the school bus.

12:08.336 --> 12:09.737
- I can't do it.
My mom simply won't allow it.

12:09.804 --> 12:10.972
- I'm good with it.

12:11.072 --> 12:12.273
I wanna see you
in action, buddy.

12:12.340 --> 12:14.175
- Mom, come on.
- I'll do it!

12:14.275 --> 12:15.443
- Oh, no.

- Whoa. Oh, this is not good.

12:24.819 --> 12:26.654
She's gonna die.

12:26.754 --> 12:29.357
- All good.
Just a small grease fire.

12:29.457 --> 12:32.326
- You are a hero.

12:32.426 --> 12:33.961
- Thank you. Thank you.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.698

12:37.798 --> 12:39.500
- Sure, I didn't do anything,
but I did respond.
