WEBVTT

00:00.069 --> 00:01.867
Previously on "Batwoman"...

00:01.904 --> 00:05.250
How about we don't get expelled
a week before graduation?

00:05.251 --> 00:07.550
I need this school,
OK? I want to be here.

00:07.551 --> 00:09.100
But they don't want you.

00:09.134 --> 00:10.990
Maybe it's best if you just
kept your distance from now on.

00:10.992 --> 00:13.825
I know you love me. Tell me that
I'm wrong, and I'll walk away

00:13.826 --> 00:15.995
and let you make the
biggest mistake of your life.

00:15.997 --> 00:17.464
You're wrong, Kate.

00:18.366 --> 00:19.932
- Is this you?
- Wasn't me.

00:19.934 --> 00:21.735
So what is she doing with herself?

00:22.237 --> 00:25.838
So are you on this assignment
to keep tabs on me or on Kate?

00:25.840 --> 00:31.144
- Dad?
- Catherine Hamilton's investigators found bones,

00:31.146 --> 00:33.646
skull fragments of a little girl.

00:33.648 --> 00:35.314
It's Beth.

00:35.316 --> 00:37.517
Hi, Daddy.

00:37.519 --> 00:38.851
Put down the knife.

00:38.853 --> 00:40.186
You gave up on me!

00:40.188 --> 00:41.688
Beth, drop the damn knife!

00:41.690 --> 00:43.356
Agh!

00:43.358 --> 00:46.526
- Dad.
- Kate, it's her. It's Beth.

00:49.363 --> 00:51.030
I have a gift for you, too.

00:51.032 --> 00:53.299
Now that we are together again,

00:53.301 --> 00:56.302
I can help you become
anyone you want to be.

00:56.304 --> 00:58.204
Are we mad?

00:58.206 --> 00:59.739
I'm afraid so.

00:59.741 --> 01:01.340
Ha ha ha!

01:02.510 --> 01:03.950
Absolutely not.

01:04.012 --> 01:06.546
Listen. The victim had
the courage to come forward

01:06.548 --> 01:09.749
and face her attackers.

01:09.751 --> 01:12.218
Well, I'm confident a jury
will make the right decision.

01:12.220 --> 01:13.553
The question is are you?

01:35.610 --> 01:37.610
Oh, my God.

01:39.948 --> 01:42.081
No, no, no!

01:48.189 --> 01:49.889
Oh, God!

02:08.008 --> 02:11.410
Beth was being held by a
madman with a medical license.

02:11.412 --> 02:13.512
We don't have much to go on.

02:13.514 --> 02:16.048
The deed to the house belonged
to Dr. August Cartwright.

02:16.050 --> 02:17.650
I have teams trying to pick up a trace,

02:17.652 --> 02:19.852
but it's like he just disappeared.

02:19.854 --> 02:22.014
Apparently he's a better
magician than he was a doctor.

02:24.925 --> 02:28.661
Beth was held in a cell by
a guy making human skin masks

02:28.663 --> 02:31.097
while I was at home playing club soccer.

02:31.099 --> 02:33.232
We need to find him.

02:33.234 --> 02:37.036
- We will.
- We didn't find her.

02:37.038 --> 02:40.339
How many times can I say I'm
sorry for not listening to you?

02:40.341 --> 02:41.941
I don't know.

02:41.943 --> 02:44.844
How many times will it
take to get Beth back?

02:49.684 --> 02:51.417
Sir, you're gonna want to see this.

02:51.419 --> 02:53.419
Gotham is reeling over the death

02:53.421 --> 02:54.887
of prosecutor Angus Stanton,

02:54.889 --> 02:56.956
who was murdered horrifically tonight.

02:56.958 --> 02:59.926
Stanton was seen by
many as a hero to Gotham,

02:59.928 --> 03:01.560
one who brought justice to the victims

03:01.562 --> 03:03.963
of some of the city's
most notorious criminals

03:03.965 --> 03:07.099
such as Jack Napier,
otherwise known as The Joker.

03:07.101 --> 03:08.901
Channel 9 has the
security camera footage.

03:08.903 --> 03:11.270
Conviction rate, Stanton was known...

03:11.272 --> 03:14.307
What's he wearing?

03:14.309 --> 03:16.609
It's an old-fashioned
executioner's hood.

03:16.611 --> 03:21.414
- Ax is a nice touch.
- This is Dana DeWitt reporting live from Old Gotham.

03:21.416 --> 03:23.249
Anybody want to tell
me why every news outlet

03:23.251 --> 03:25.117
in Gotham had this
and we didn't even get

03:25.119 --> 03:27.586
so much as a heads-up from the GCPD?

03:27.588 --> 03:29.622
Technically, it's
outside district lines.

03:29.624 --> 03:31.958
And I believe it's because
they called someone else.

03:40.901 --> 03:43.502
I am not about to stand
around and let Gotham cry out

03:43.504 --> 03:46.672
to be saved by someone
who hides behind a mask.

03:46.674 --> 03:49.842
The Bat is nothing more
than a symbol of false hope.

03:49.844 --> 03:52.178
I want this so-called
Executioner cuffed

03:52.180 --> 03:53.846
and stuffed in a cell in Blackgate.

03:53.848 --> 03:55.614
If this city starts to think it can rely

03:55.616 --> 03:57.249
on a vigilante for justice,

03:57.251 --> 04:01.087
we might as well hand
it over to the crazies.

04:01.089 --> 04:04.657
Sir... I know it's all hands
on deck with the Stanton case,

04:04.659 --> 04:06.025
but I was hoping to get your permission

04:06.027 --> 04:07.460
for another special assignment.

04:07.462 --> 04:08.961
Who is it this time?

04:08.963 --> 04:11.163
Batwoman.

04:11.165 --> 04:13.332
Don't you want to know
who's behind the mask?

04:32.486 --> 04:36.889
Heh heh heh!

04:36.891 --> 04:38.391
Hmm.

04:42.562 --> 04:43.963
Head back, sweetie.

05:14.061 --> 05:15.227
Mm-hmm.

05:19.733 --> 05:24.003
One... final... touch.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.074
There.

05:30.377 --> 05:32.545
Ahh. Dazzle me.

05:37.350 --> 05:43.255
Oh. A perfect match for Dean Deveraux.

05:45.759 --> 05:48.260
Wouldn't you agree, Mr. Deveraux?

05:48.262 --> 05:50.362
Please don't hurt me.

05:50.364 --> 05:54.934
I don't understand why
we don't just kill him.

05:54.936 --> 05:58.304
Because my sister is
watching me like a hawk.

05:58.306 --> 06:01.474
Still trying to bring the old Beth back.

06:01.476 --> 06:03.075
You're not thinking of giving her

06:03.077 --> 06:05.611
the old Beth back, are you?

06:05.613 --> 06:07.079
Of course not.

06:07.081 --> 06:09.315
Really? Because the old Alice I remember

06:09.317 --> 06:12.251
wouldn't give a second thought
about opening his throat

06:12.253 --> 06:13.652
with a butterfly knife.

06:13.654 --> 06:15.121
She's changed you.

06:15.123 --> 06:17.089
Not at all.

06:17.091 --> 06:18.757
You're the one who's changed.

06:18.759 --> 06:20.960
You used to trust me.

06:24.164 --> 06:26.098
What about you, Dean?

06:26.100 --> 06:27.766
Do you trust me?

06:27.768 --> 06:30.970
I think you'd make an excellent partner.

06:30.972 --> 06:33.739
I seem to be in need of a replacement.

06:33.741 --> 06:37.910
Stop. Stop.

06:37.912 --> 06:40.513
I'll do whatever you want.

06:40.515 --> 06:43.282
Good.

06:43.284 --> 06:46.285
Because I need you to steal
Catherine's shiny, new toy,

06:46.287 --> 06:49.855
the one that she's too stingy to share.

06:54.594 --> 06:57.263
- You see the Bat-signal?
- That is why I'm here.

06:57.265 --> 06:58.831
You know what this means, right?

06:58.833 --> 07:00.432
First time the city's called Batwoman

07:00.434 --> 07:02.668
for backup means I can't screw it up.

07:02.670 --> 07:04.336
It means you're in.

07:04.338 --> 07:06.472
GCPD's got you on their speed dial now.

07:06.474 --> 07:08.641
Commissioner Forbes trusts you.

07:08.643 --> 07:11.710
Commissioner? My dad
still sees me as his enemy.

07:11.712 --> 07:14.046
Stopping this guy has to
convince him otherwise.

07:14.048 --> 07:16.549
That's not the only
reason worth stopping him.

07:18.051 --> 07:21.687
Stanton was the prosecutor
who put away the guy

07:21.689 --> 07:23.856
that killed my dad.

07:23.858 --> 07:25.891
It was an armed robbery, right?

07:25.893 --> 07:29.328
Night of my high school graduation.

07:29.330 --> 07:33.799
We were celebrating me getting into MIT,

07:33.801 --> 07:35.201
ran out of ice.

07:35.203 --> 07:37.036
My dad went out to go get some.

07:37.038 --> 07:39.338
Next thing I know, there
are two cops at the door.

07:39.340 --> 07:41.974
Wanted me to come
down and I.D. the body.

07:45.645 --> 07:49.048
We were waiting on him to cut the cake.

07:49.050 --> 07:51.183
Lucius Fox did a lot
of good for this city.

07:51.185 --> 07:53.485
Yeah. So did Stanton.

07:53.487 --> 07:55.020
Never stopped until he put the guy

07:55.022 --> 07:58.324
who shot my dad behind bars.

07:58.326 --> 08:00.159
Any suspects?

08:00.161 --> 08:02.528
Well, if you exclude the
law-abiding citizens of Gotham,

08:02.530 --> 08:04.863
that leaves the other half.

08:04.865 --> 08:06.699
There has to be some
way to narrow that down.

08:06.701 --> 08:08.500
Start with the violent offenders.

08:08.502 --> 08:10.035
Cross reference with recent parolees,

08:10.037 --> 08:11.570
work release, and escapees

08:11.572 --> 08:13.239
with whatever biometrics we can get

08:13.241 --> 08:14.673
from the security footage.

08:14.675 --> 08:17.843
All right. Huh. This is interesting.

08:17.845 --> 08:19.912
Chris Medlock, otherwise
known as Chris The Fist,

08:19.914 --> 08:21.413
ex-boxer, ex-con.

08:21.415 --> 08:24.383
What was The Fist in for?

08:24.385 --> 08:26.118
Uh, shot and killed a bartender.

08:26.120 --> 08:28.520
He confessed, later
claimed it was coerced.

08:28.522 --> 08:30.389
But they found the gun in his car.

08:30.391 --> 08:32.357
Pleaded down to second-degree murder,

08:32.360 --> 08:33.860
got 30 in Blackgate.

08:33.861 --> 08:36.061
He was lucky to avoid the death penalty.

08:36.063 --> 08:38.397
Yeah. The Fist did not see it that way.

08:38.399 --> 08:40.265
Check out his sentencing.

08:46.906 --> 08:48.474
I'll get you, you son of a bitch!

08:48.476 --> 08:50.209
This ain't over!

08:50.211 --> 08:51.644
I got a whole bunch
of time to figure out

08:51.646 --> 08:53.112
how I'm gonna kill your ass!

08:53.114 --> 08:55.281
Thanks to overcrowding, he was paroled

08:55.283 --> 08:57.316
just a few months ago.

08:57.318 --> 09:00.486
Can't wait to meet him.
Guy have an address?

09:00.488 --> 09:03.656
We may not need one.

09:03.658 --> 09:07.059
Uh, check out what just
came in over GCPD dispatch.

09:07.061 --> 09:08.594
Someone claiming to be The Executioner

09:08.596 --> 09:09.895
barricaded himself inside a building

09:09.897 --> 09:11.930
at the 200 block of Rucka Avenue.

09:11.932 --> 09:13.966
Claims to have several hostages.

09:13.968 --> 09:15.668
That's in West Harlow.

09:15.670 --> 09:17.069
- Put it on the screen.
- OK.

09:17.071 --> 09:19.438
All right. Let's get on this.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.774
I don't care if it's
outside our district.

09:21.776 --> 09:24.243
Let's show Gotham we can keep them safe.

09:24.245 --> 09:25.477
Move!

09:38.024 --> 09:40.317
- Talking.
- Says he'll only speak to one guy,

09:40.318 --> 09:41.927
a Detective Donnelly.

09:41.929 --> 09:43.250
- Who?
- Detective Donnelly,

09:43.251 --> 09:46.070
time is running out on
your hostages. Get in here,

09:46.071 --> 09:48.990
- or I start shooting these people.
- Listen. You don't have to go in there.

09:49.003 --> 09:53.772
- Let me get a negotiator down here.
- Nah. Me and The Fist go way back.

09:53.774 --> 09:55.307
Detective.

10:01.448 --> 10:03.048
Like the new look.

10:04.318 --> 10:06.118
Red suits you.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.886
Goes with everything.

10:07.888 --> 10:10.856
Time's up, Donnelly.

10:34.214 --> 10:36.582
No. Donnelly, stay back!

10:37.985 --> 10:39.218
No. Wait! Stop!

10:49.996 --> 10:51.363
I'm hit.

10:52.999 --> 10:54.666
You're bleeding.

10:54.668 --> 10:58.771
- I'll get you help.
- Thanks... Kate.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.407
Oh, my God! Sophie!

11:16.409 --> 11:18.410
I need to know if you can fix her.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.179
What was she shot with?

11:21.181 --> 11:23.114
- A bullet.
- I know it's a bullet.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.816
I mean, hollow point,
blackout, wadcutter?

11:24.818 --> 11:26.217
Does it matter?

11:26.219 --> 11:27.485
Why did you bring her here?

11:27.487 --> 11:28.786
She can afford a real hospital.

11:28.788 --> 11:30.488
You were closer, and, uh,

11:30.490 --> 11:32.056
I need you to keep her until I get back.

11:32.058 --> 11:33.591
Crows don't know she's missing.

11:33.593 --> 11:36.294
- No, you can't...
- Do not let her leave.

12:42.794 --> 12:44.896
Man of the hour.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.864
Congratulations.

12:46.866 --> 12:48.900
You have succeeded where
so many have failed.

12:48.902 --> 12:52.670
The coil accelerator, it works at last.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.872
I just have to know

12:54.874 --> 12:56.841
how were you able to overcome

12:56.843 --> 13:01.212
the ferromagnetic projectile saturation?

13:01.214 --> 13:05.049
Ha ha! You almost had
me there, Ms. Hamilton.

13:05.051 --> 13:07.919
Trick question. That's
proprietary information.

13:10.155 --> 13:13.090
Hard to imagine...

13:13.092 --> 13:15.826
Something so delicate
harnessing enough power

13:15.828 --> 13:17.428
to penetrate the Batsuit.

13:21.433 --> 13:22.934
Well done, Dean.

13:35.280 --> 13:37.915
- She called you Kate?
- She knows who I am.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.351
I mean it. That's just great, fantastic.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.186
So naturally, you
decided to drop her off

13:42.188 --> 13:43.788
at your sister's unlicensed clinic.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.122
Mary will take care of her.

13:45.124 --> 13:46.291
She'll also keep her from leaving,

13:46.293 --> 13:48.059
and as long as she can't
leave, she can't talk.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.894
But she's a Crow, your
father's second in command.

13:49.896 --> 13:52.016
You really think you can
convince her not to tell him?

13:52.065 --> 13:53.798
I'll deal with that after we've
dealt with The Executioner.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.400
We need to figure out his next target.

13:55.402 --> 13:56.801
Guy's not making it easy.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.236
He keeps changing his M.O.

13:58.238 --> 13:59.637
50,000 volts of electricity,

13:59.639 --> 14:00.705
then a bunch of rifles.

14:00.707 --> 14:01.973
Doesn't make any sense.

14:01.975 --> 14:03.508
Unless it's a pattern.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.577
The Fist dresses up as an executioner,

14:05.579 --> 14:08.313
kills Stanton with electricity
like an electric chair.

14:08.315 --> 14:11.516
Then he gets Donnelly to walk
in on that shooting gallery.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.151
Like a firing squad.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.753
He's using methods of capital
punishment to kill his victims.

14:15.755 --> 14:16.755
On it.

14:21.997 --> 14:23.865
Gotham's used 3 ways to
kill people on death row...

14:23.867 --> 14:26.067
electric chair, firing squad...

14:26.069 --> 14:28.569
which made a brief comeback
under Mayor Cobblepot...

14:28.571 --> 14:30.838
and the gas chamber.

14:30.840 --> 14:32.874
So his next victim will be with gas.

14:32.876 --> 14:34.242
Guy's got a flair for detail,

14:34.344 --> 14:36.750
so I bet you a batarang he'll
use hydrogen cyanide pellets

14:36.751 --> 14:39.480
just like they did in
the gas chamber, and...

14:41.083 --> 14:44.018
And there's only one warehouse
in Gotham that stores them.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.381
Who's there?

15:00.383 --> 15:03.551
Someone who needs information.

15:03.553 --> 15:06.988
Holy crap! You're her!

15:06.990 --> 15:10.391
Yo. I got to get this.

15:10.393 --> 15:12.700
- Damn, girl!
- Not happening.

15:12.701 --> 15:14.862
Anything out of the
ordinary around here lately?

15:14.864 --> 15:17.698
- What, besides this?
- Answer the question.

15:17.700 --> 15:20.001
Naw. That means someone
had to bet by me,

15:20.003 --> 15:23.037
and that ain't gonna happen.

15:23.039 --> 15:25.339
It's been quiet,

15:25.341 --> 15:28.376
but, uh, you know,
it doesn't have to be.

15:28.378 --> 15:30.378
Yo. Let me buy you a drink,

15:30.380 --> 15:34.315
and you can tell me all
about the superhero thing.

15:34.317 --> 15:37.585
I've been thinking about
getting into the game myself.

15:37.587 --> 15:39.587
What do you say?

15:39.589 --> 15:43.491
I get off at 11:00, and, uh,
if you play your cards right,

15:43.493 --> 15:45.760
you won't be too far behind.

15:48.997 --> 15:51.399
OK. So this place hasn't seen any action

15:51.401 --> 15:54.035
and apparently neither has its guard.

15:54.037 --> 15:56.691
Yeah. I think I might know why.

15:56.692 --> 15:58.172
Got a visual on Chris The Fist,

15:58.174 --> 15:59.874
alleyway on Sprang.

16:14.856 --> 16:17.024
Unh! Ooh!

16:22.931 --> 16:25.299
Get off me! I didn't do nothing.

16:25.301 --> 16:29.870
Oh, got it. So you're just
out for a late-night jog, huh?

16:29.872 --> 16:32.473
Crows got The Fist.

16:32.475 --> 16:34.976
Well, I guess a lot of people
will be sleeping easier tonight.

16:34.978 --> 16:37.044
I know you wanted to catch him,

16:37.046 --> 16:39.380
but you can convince the Crows
you're not the enemy tomorrow.

16:39.382 --> 16:42.783
Tomorrow may be too late.
I need to check on Sophie.

16:51.727 --> 16:53.227
Unh!

16:59.935 --> 17:01.736
Kate, you copy?

17:04.099 --> 17:05.300
_

17:23.791 --> 17:25.291
Hey, K... Kate!

17:30.500 --> 17:31.866
Kate, do you copy? What just happened?

17:31.868 --> 17:34.035
The Crows got the wrong guy,

17:34.037 --> 17:36.771
and The Executioner
got what he came for.

17:41.533 --> 17:44.468
All this Bat tech, and you
came up with frozen water?

17:45.450 --> 17:47.117
Hmm. I checked every camera angle

17:47.119 --> 17:49.185
in the warehouse security system, but,

17:49.187 --> 17:50.954
the license plate's got
mud or something on it.

17:50.956 --> 17:53.022
Can't really get a good view of it.

17:53.024 --> 17:55.024
Don't suppose you were
able to make it out.

17:55.026 --> 17:58.461
Didn't quite catch it
when it plowed into me.

17:58.463 --> 18:01.030
Oh. Yeah. Oh, yeah. That's great!

18:01.032 --> 18:02.999
My ribs would argue otherwise.

18:03.001 --> 18:04.334
No. I'm serious, OK?

18:04.336 --> 18:05.935
The suit's carbon fiber ribbing

18:05.937 --> 18:07.504
is designed to absorb any impact,

18:07.506 --> 18:09.205
so any deformation in the fibers is

18:09.207 --> 18:10.874
recorded in the suit's data.

18:14.145 --> 18:17.147
So it was originally
designed to track damage

18:17.149 --> 18:19.015
caused by bullets, you
know, blunt-force trauma,

18:19.017 --> 18:21.050
that kind of thing.

18:21.052 --> 18:23.219
There's no reason it wouldn't pick up

18:23.221 --> 18:25.989
- an impression from a car bumper.
- Or a license plate.

18:25.991 --> 18:31.528
Hmm. OK. Uh, it's a
partial, but it'll work.

18:31.530 --> 18:35.532
OK. The truck is registered
to a... Bertrand Eldon,

18:35.534 --> 18:40.036
and... he was at Blackgate for 20 years.

18:40.038 --> 18:42.705
What was he in for?

18:42.707 --> 18:46.042
He worked there. He
was their executioner.

18:52.307 --> 18:54.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Uh-uh!

18:54.442 --> 18:56.109
I just did some of the
best work of my life

18:56.111 --> 18:57.844
crocheting you back together.

18:57.846 --> 18:59.979
What?! Where am I?

18:59.981 --> 19:02.015
Mary, what the hell is going on?

19:02.017 --> 19:03.583
Batwoman brought you in.

19:03.585 --> 19:06.519
- You were shot.
- Unh. Batwoman?

19:06.521 --> 19:09.155
I feel like we glossed over the part

19:09.157 --> 19:10.356
where I saved your life.

19:10.358 --> 19:13.760
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

19:13.762 --> 19:15.862
You work here?

19:15.864 --> 19:17.830
It's mine.

19:17.932 --> 19:20.933
My followers think I'm
turning up at the club,

19:20.935 --> 19:22.702
ordering bottle service.

19:22.704 --> 19:25.371
Truth is I'm usually here,

19:25.373 --> 19:26.973
trying to help serve the people

19:26.975 --> 19:29.710
that Gotham hospitals turn away.

19:29.711 --> 19:31.344
- Mary.
- Hmm.

19:31.346 --> 19:37.317
- If your dad ever found out about this place...
- He won't. He can't.

19:40.712 --> 19:42.945
Yeah. I didn't do that.

19:42.947 --> 19:45.548
Well, you better undo it.

19:45.550 --> 19:47.650
Batwoman would kill me.

19:47.652 --> 19:49.752
Frankly, she's scarier than you.

19:49.754 --> 19:53.089
Mary, why am I cuffed to this bed?

19:53.091 --> 19:55.825
Uh, she said not to let you leave.

19:55.827 --> 19:57.326
Do you know who she is?

19:57.328 --> 19:59.162
No. Honestly, I don't want to know.

19:59.164 --> 20:01.964
I don't need that
kind of responsibility.

20:01.966 --> 20:04.400
Well, I do know who she is,

20:04.402 --> 20:06.803
and that's why she won't let me leave.

20:23.567 --> 20:25.101
I'm in.

20:33.710 --> 20:35.278
No one's home.

20:35.280 --> 20:37.079
Why would a guy working
at Blackgate target

20:37.081 --> 20:38.281
a cop and a prosecutor?

20:38.283 --> 20:39.549
They're on the same side.

20:39.551 --> 20:42.451
That doesn't make any sense.

20:42.453 --> 20:44.520
I'm looking for that answer right now.

20:44.522 --> 20:47.790
Looks like he was a model employee.

20:47.792 --> 20:50.393
Stay frosty. This guy is methodical,

20:50.395 --> 20:52.728
technically proficient,
always a few steps ahead.

20:52.730 --> 20:54.430
He could have anything
waiting for you in there.

20:54.432 --> 20:56.566
Already has just sitting
on the coffee table.

20:56.568 --> 20:59.635
- What?
- The hydrogen cyanide pellets.

20:59.637 --> 21:01.070
I found them.

21:01.072 --> 21:02.805
- On the coffee table?
- Yes.

21:02.807 --> 21:04.373
It... it's probably a trap.

21:04.375 --> 21:06.375
I'm aware, but I don't see

21:06.377 --> 21:08.411
any trip sensors or wires

21:08.413 --> 21:10.546
or pressure plates.

21:10.548 --> 21:13.482
What's the Bat protocol with this?

21:13.484 --> 21:15.885
- Uh...
- Well, I can't just stand here

21:15.887 --> 21:17.486
staring at this thing, waiting
for The Executioner to come back.

21:17.488 --> 21:21.324
- Come on.
- Yeah. OK. Hang on.

21:21.326 --> 21:24.493
Can you play some hold
music while I wait?

21:24.495 --> 21:25.962
No. OK. I'm just gonna grab it.

21:25.964 --> 21:27.897
No, no, no, no. Don't do that.

21:27.899 --> 21:31.968
- Kate, don't!
- Too late.

21:31.970 --> 21:34.937
- And?
- And I'm still talking to you.

21:34.939 --> 21:36.105
It's light.

21:36.107 --> 21:39.308
Is it empty?

21:39.310 --> 21:40.676
Hmm.

21:40.678 --> 21:41.844
Not quite.

21:51.922 --> 21:57.460
So if you found this, then...
you found me, and, um...

21:57.462 --> 21:58.694
And I did it.

21:58.696 --> 22:00.363
I am guilty as sin,

22:00.365 --> 22:01.797
but I'm not the only one.

22:01.899 --> 22:03.599
For 20 years, I threw the switch

22:03.601 --> 22:06.068
on the worst people
Gotham ever spat out.

22:06.070 --> 22:08.204
I was glad to do it, too.

22:08.206 --> 22:10.539
Doing the public a service,
and it never bothered me

22:10.541 --> 22:12.141
when they said they were innocent.

22:12.143 --> 22:14.110
Great. Sadistic and long-winded.

22:14.112 --> 22:15.644
I mean, what else were
they gonna say, right?

22:15.646 --> 22:19.648
See, then all their stories,

22:19.650 --> 22:21.050
they started to sound the same.

22:21.052 --> 22:23.285
The same names kept coming up,

22:23.287 --> 22:25.154
same evidence,

22:25.156 --> 22:27.056
and everybody who sat in my chair

22:27.058 --> 22:29.058
started to look the same...

22:29.060 --> 22:33.095
black, brown, poor.

22:33.097 --> 22:35.998
In 20 years, I never
juiced a rich white guy,

22:36.000 --> 22:39.235
so I started digging in their files.

22:39.237 --> 22:41.971
You know what I found?

22:41.973 --> 22:45.074
The same 3 corrupt law
enforcement officials

22:45.076 --> 22:47.076
pulling the strings in every case.

22:49.579 --> 22:51.848
Coerced confessions

22:52.750 --> 22:56.952
and murder weapons suddenly
showing up out of nowhere.

22:56.954 --> 22:59.422
I mean, obviously planted.

22:59.424 --> 23:02.758
Didn't Chris The Fist say
that his confession was coerced

23:02.760 --> 23:05.294
and the murder weapon just
suddenly turned up in his car?

23:05.296 --> 23:08.264
The people that I
executed were innocent,

23:08.266 --> 23:11.100
which meant that...

23:11.102 --> 23:13.002
that I was the guilty one,

23:13.004 --> 23:17.339
that... that cabal, they
turned me into a murderer,

23:17.341 --> 23:20.342
which... they made me
punish the innocent.

23:20.344 --> 23:22.645
So who's the third member of this cabal?

23:22.647 --> 23:26.949
Wait. You're not actually buying this?

23:26.951 --> 23:30.286
OK. Believe me. I know racial
profiling is a thing in Gotham,

23:30.288 --> 23:32.188
but this guy is obviously crazy,

23:32.190 --> 23:34.523
almost killed Sophie,
nearly made you roadkill.

23:34.525 --> 23:37.960
- Doesn't make him wrong.
- He's an admitted killer, Kate.

23:37.962 --> 23:40.529
I knew Stanton, OK?

23:40.531 --> 23:43.666
He spent hours with my
family day after day,

23:43.668 --> 23:46.702
and he never, ever stopped working

23:46.704 --> 23:49.538
until he found justice.

23:49.540 --> 23:52.308
If Stanton is accused of being dirty,

23:52.310 --> 23:56.245
my dad's killer could use
that go get a new trial.

23:56.247 --> 23:58.214
But if Chris The Fist or anyone else

23:58.216 --> 23:59.915
can do go down for something
that they didn't do,

23:59.917 --> 24:01.851
how is that justice?

24:16.266 --> 24:18.100
A little present from the Crows.

24:18.102 --> 24:20.936
Next time, call us first.

24:20.938 --> 24:22.538
We may not have a Klieg light,

24:22.540 --> 24:24.773
but we do have a phone number.

24:26.744 --> 24:28.043
Aah!

24:31.248 --> 24:32.882
Unh! Ohh!

24:44.194 --> 24:45.628
Everybody fan out!

24:46.930 --> 24:48.430
Move, move!

25:07.333 --> 25:10.001
Your turn.

25:10.003 --> 25:11.703
Uh, it... it's OK.

25:11.705 --> 25:14.205
You can just win.

25:17.609 --> 25:21.879
I said... your turn.

25:31.858 --> 25:34.125
King me.

25:41.400 --> 25:42.633
What?!

25:42.635 --> 25:45.169
It's me.

25:45.171 --> 25:46.905
How did you get this number?

25:47.307 --> 25:50.842
Let's call it twintuition.

25:50.844 --> 25:53.244
Why did you send Mouse
into Hamilton Dynamics

25:53.246 --> 25:55.546
to get a weapon that can kill Batwoman?

25:57.349 --> 25:59.250
- Where is he?
- He's fine,

25:59.252 --> 26:03.521
or he will be as long
as you tell me the truth.

26:03.523 --> 26:07.525
Heh. Dear sister, if
I wanted to kill you,

26:07.527 --> 26:10.061
I wouldn't have to wait for
you to be wearing the suit.

26:10.063 --> 26:13.498
That's so sweet of you.

26:13.500 --> 26:20.571
Your concern for me is
so touching, dear sister.

26:20.573 --> 26:23.508
So Kate is Batwoman.

26:27.279 --> 26:30.448
I do not like being toyed with!

26:30.450 --> 26:32.884
And I don't like traitors.

26:32.886 --> 26:34.752
What's wrong with you?

26:34.754 --> 26:36.854
First, she abandons you, then
she tries to lock you away,

26:36.856 --> 26:38.923
and still, you try to protect her.

26:38.925 --> 26:42.226
Because she's still my sister.

26:42.228 --> 26:47.265
Real family doesn't abandon their own.

26:47.267 --> 26:51.035
Who snuck food to you in
the middle of the night?

26:51.037 --> 26:52.737
Who taught you rummy

26:52.739 --> 26:55.206
and let you sleep with Mr. Pandy

26:55.208 --> 26:57.642
and promised to protect
you no matter what?

26:57.644 --> 27:02.113
Me! I did, Alice, because I was there,

27:02.115 --> 27:04.949
and she wasn't!

27:04.951 --> 27:08.986
After everything we've been through,

27:08.988 --> 27:12.290
you keep secrets from me?

27:19.098 --> 27:20.965
Try keeping that a secret.

27:26.969 --> 27:31.439
OK. So who had Batwoman
rescues a psychopath

27:31.441 --> 27:33.107
on their bingo card?

27:33.109 --> 27:34.809
Because I've got some
big, fat, empty spaces

27:34.811 --> 27:37.011
for Batwoman takes down Alice

27:37.013 --> 27:39.247
and Batwoman gets a cat out of a tree.

27:39.249 --> 27:41.149
Talk to me, Gotham. Anyone else feeling

27:41.151 --> 27:43.117
a little "Bat-trayed"?

27:43.119 --> 27:45.687
The people that I
executed were innocent,

27:45.689 --> 27:48.489
which meant that...

27:48.491 --> 27:50.124
that I was the guilty one.

27:50.126 --> 27:52.293
That cabal by Judge Calverick

27:52.295 --> 27:55.129
condemned innocent people to die.

27:55.131 --> 27:57.165
I heard you got a visit from Batwoman.

27:57.167 --> 27:58.666
More like an ambush.

27:58.668 --> 28:00.935
Now one nut job wants me to listen

28:00.937 --> 28:02.503
to another nut job.

28:02.505 --> 28:04.372
Claims Judge Calverick, one of Gotham's

28:04.374 --> 28:07.208
most upstanding justices, is a fraud.

28:07.210 --> 28:09.377
So you're not even gonna
look into this judge.

28:09.379 --> 28:11.612
Why? Because some social justice warrior

28:11.614 --> 28:13.715
thinks he knows more
about the rule of law

28:13.717 --> 28:15.817
than the cops and the
lawyers who protect this city?

28:15.819 --> 28:17.318
Nah. We got the right guy.

28:17.320 --> 28:19.320
Batwoman interfered.

28:19.322 --> 28:20.888
Batwoman wouldn't have stepped
in if she didn't have a reason.

28:20.890 --> 28:22.690
Before you give a shred of credibility

28:22.692 --> 28:24.993
to some criminal in a Bat costume,

28:24.995 --> 28:28.329
let me remind you that Batman
destroyed our family's lives.

28:28.331 --> 28:30.698
He is not the one that drove
Mom's car off that bridge.

28:30.700 --> 28:32.567
Well, he may as well have been.

28:32.569 --> 28:34.702
Batman brought out all
the crazies in Gotham.

28:34.704 --> 28:36.170
If it weren't for him, there
wouldn't have been a Joker!

28:36.172 --> 28:37.572
Your mom would be alive,

28:37.574 --> 28:39.307
and Beth wouldn't be Alice.

28:39.309 --> 28:42.076
Beth is Alice because we
stopped looking for her.

28:44.847 --> 28:46.714
I'm not arguing about this right now.

28:46.716 --> 28:48.683
That would be a lot easier, wouldn't it,

28:48.685 --> 28:52.053
just act like we did nothing wrong.

28:52.055 --> 28:55.189
We looked... Everywhere for Beth.

28:55.191 --> 28:58.159
I looked everywhere. I held
onto hope for the both of us

28:58.161 --> 28:59.761
despite the lack of evidence,

28:59.763 --> 29:01.529
despite the police giving up,

29:01.531 --> 29:04.332
despite the fact that
everyone thought she was dead.

29:04.334 --> 29:06.167
I hoped when it was hard,

29:06.169 --> 29:08.536
and you... Just gave up

29:08.538 --> 29:10.438
and put your energy into blaming Batman

29:10.440 --> 29:13.574
because it was easy.

29:13.576 --> 29:15.510
That's why Beth is Alice.

29:18.013 --> 29:20.281
You wouldn't listen then,
and you won't listen now,

29:20.283 --> 29:22.784
and an innocent man is
gonna pay the price for it.

29:42.538 --> 29:46.241
Look who lucked out by getting
the last grape Popsicle!

29:46.443 --> 29:48.943
Hmm. Looks like you're healing nicely,

29:48.945 --> 29:51.112
but I guess healing can't get in the way

29:51.114 --> 29:53.948
of you spilling the tea on Batwoman.

29:53.950 --> 29:55.917
Believe it or not, I'm
trying to protect her.

29:55.919 --> 29:58.286
By having my dad shut
down her entire operation?

29:58.288 --> 29:59.787
She's gonna get herself killed.

29:59.789 --> 30:02.156
Batwoman can take care of herself

30:02.158 --> 30:04.725
just like she took care
of you twice by my count,

30:04.727 --> 30:07.161
and now you're just gonna betray her?

30:07.163 --> 30:09.831
Uh... I mean, what?

30:09.833 --> 30:11.899
Is that, like, your thing?

30:11.901 --> 30:13.568
What's that supposed to mean?

30:13.570 --> 30:15.002
I mean, that's what you did to Kate,

30:15.004 --> 30:16.571
and then she had to put an entire ocean

30:16.573 --> 30:18.272
between you and her,

30:18.274 --> 30:21.008
and... now you walk around,

30:21.010 --> 30:23.578
pretend like she meant nothing to you.

30:23.580 --> 30:25.246
You don't even know what happened.

30:25.248 --> 30:29.584
No, but I saw what it did to her.

30:29.586 --> 30:31.986
Look. You're right. It's not my drama,

30:31.988 --> 30:36.090
so do what you want.

30:36.092 --> 30:38.626
In the meantime,

30:38.628 --> 30:41.262
ibuprofen every 4-6 hours

30:41.264 --> 30:43.030
and change the bandage once a day.

30:43.032 --> 30:45.032
Don't tell my dad about this clinic...

30:46.368 --> 30:48.269
And maybe think about whether or not

30:48.271 --> 30:50.471
you want to add Batwoman to
the list of people you hurt.

31:11.053 --> 31:13.021
Working late, Your Honor?

31:13.723 --> 31:14.756
H... how did you?

31:14.858 --> 31:16.938
Looks like you're burning
more than the midnight oil.

31:17.794 --> 31:19.560
Is that the evidence?

31:19.572 --> 31:21.238
Donnelly got the confessions,

31:21.240 --> 31:22.873
Stanton convinced the jury,

31:22.875 --> 31:24.575
you just banged your gavel?

31:24.577 --> 31:25.976
I can pay you.

31:25.978 --> 31:27.712
You have to protect me from him.

31:27.714 --> 31:29.980
You'll get round-the-clock
protection at Blackgate

31:29.982 --> 31:31.716
free of charge.

31:43.395 --> 31:45.229
Go!

31:45.231 --> 31:46.564
Unh!

31:49.000 --> 31:51.302
You protect him, a man who sent

31:51.304 --> 31:52.770
so many innocents to their deaths?

31:52.772 --> 31:54.271
The law will take care of it.

31:54.273 --> 31:56.507
Yeah? I used to believe that, too,

31:56.509 --> 31:58.809
until the law turned me into a murderer.

31:58.811 --> 32:00.344
The law's not perfect,
I'll give you that.

32:00.346 --> 32:03.080
Doesn't mean you get
to rewrite it in blood.

32:03.082 --> 32:05.316
You trust the law so much,

32:05.318 --> 32:06.951
why are you wearing that suit?

32:06.953 --> 32:08.686
I'm gonna need backup.

32:08.688 --> 32:09.820
What do you want me to say?

32:09.822 --> 32:10.988
He makes a good point.

32:10.990 --> 32:12.590
No. For the judge.

32:12.592 --> 32:14.191
Get the judge into
protective custody now.

32:14.193 --> 32:16.327
Right. On it.

32:47.325 --> 32:49.160
Sweep the rest of the building.

33:07.479 --> 33:09.480
Glad you decided to
go after the right guy.

33:09.482 --> 33:11.382
I don't see how you and
him are that different.

33:11.384 --> 33:13.751
Taking the law into your own hands,

33:13.753 --> 33:18.189
appointing yourself judge and jury.

33:18.191 --> 33:20.724
Pretty sure you just
did the exact same thing.

33:20.726 --> 33:22.693
I saved your life.

33:22.695 --> 33:24.528
You telling me I made a mistake?

33:24.530 --> 33:26.931
I don't know. Ask The Fist.

33:26.933 --> 33:29.767
I admit I got it wrong,

33:29.769 --> 33:31.869
but you know the difference
between me and you?

33:31.871 --> 33:34.038
When I make a mistake,
everybody knows my name.

33:34.040 --> 33:35.739
I am accountable to
the people of Gotham.

33:35.741 --> 33:40.878
You... you hide behind your anonymity.

33:40.880 --> 33:44.215
Who are you accountable to?

33:45.751 --> 33:47.251
Guess we'll find out.

34:05.537 --> 34:08.806
Heart rate monitor linked
to a dead man's switch.

34:14.279 --> 34:16.280
Looks like we're about to join him.

34:24.590 --> 34:27.591
This is Kane. Anybody read me?

34:27.592 --> 34:29.326
Whoa! Suit showing
oxygen levels dropping.

34:30.929 --> 34:32.329
No kidding. Executioner turned this room

34:32.331 --> 34:33.764
into a gas chamber.

34:33.766 --> 34:35.299
Can your men get us out of here?

34:35.301 --> 34:36.800
He triggered the lock-down procedure.

34:36.802 --> 34:39.235
Every way in and out
of here is sealed off.

34:39.237 --> 34:42.072
Steel-reinforced doors.

34:42.074 --> 34:44.507
By the time my guys get through them...

34:47.413 --> 34:50.813
Air's getting thin in here. I
need a solution. You went to MIT.

34:50.815 --> 34:53.918
I got in. I didn't actually go.

34:53.920 --> 34:57.855
OK. Uh... OK, OK.

34:57.857 --> 35:00.398
OK. Hydrogen cyanide,
emphasis on hydrogen.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.660
It's flammable. Think the Hindenburg.

35:02.662 --> 35:05.190
- Not a comforting thought.
- The point is you can ignite it.

35:05.191 --> 35:06.300
The flames will burn off the cyanide.

35:06.301 --> 35:07.960
- OK. Copy.
- Only problem is

35:08.001 --> 35:09.801
hydrogen will only
burn at 6% saturation.

35:10.103 --> 35:11.802
For those of us who didn't get into MIT.

35:11.804 --> 35:14.071
You got let the gas fill the room first.

35:16.389 --> 35:17.788
We're not gonna last that long.

35:17.790 --> 35:19.256
Well, you got to try, Kate.

35:19.258 --> 35:20.624
You're only at 3%.

35:20.626 --> 35:21.992
You got hang in there.

35:21.994 --> 35:23.394
You need to stay low to the ground.

35:23.396 --> 35:24.995
- Get away from me.
- Come on.

35:24.997 --> 35:26.731
That symbol took everything from me.

35:26.733 --> 35:30.267
It's not gonna be the last thing I see.

35:30.359 --> 35:33.327
Stay with me. Stay awake.

35:33.329 --> 35:35.396
Come on, Commander. Talk to me.

35:35.398 --> 35:38.065
Tell me all the reasons you hate Batman.

35:38.067 --> 35:40.668
That symbol let my family die.

35:43.538 --> 35:46.373
4%.

35:46.555 --> 35:49.957
Hey. If you're gonna hate
the symbol, hate the symbol.

35:49.959 --> 35:52.426
Let it fuel you into staying alive.

35:52.428 --> 35:54.461
5%.

35:54.463 --> 35:56.463
I have to blame that symbol.

35:56.465 --> 35:59.566
If I don't...

35:59.568 --> 36:02.269
If you don't, what? Tell me.

36:02.271 --> 36:04.438
I have to blame myself.

36:07.075 --> 36:08.542
6%. Do it!

36:15.984 --> 36:17.918
Kate, come on. Talk to me.

36:22.724 --> 36:25.159
Commander, Commander, come on!

36:28.631 --> 36:30.497
We're OK.

36:34.067 --> 36:36.901
Never let it be said
that Gotham's gadfly

36:36.903 --> 36:38.903
does not give credit
where credit is due.

36:39.218 --> 36:40.884
Batwoman got this one right,

36:40.886 --> 36:42.652
and the rest of us whiffed.

36:42.654 --> 36:44.454
Guess Jacob Kane won't be the only one

36:44.456 --> 36:46.790
eating a little Crow.

36:46.792 --> 36:50.193
Boxer Chris "The Fist"
Medlock was not only cleared

36:50.195 --> 36:53.463
in The Executioner
murders but also exonerated

36:53.465 --> 36:55.398
of his past murder conviction.

36:55.400 --> 36:57.200
Talk about a one-two punch.

36:57.202 --> 36:59.503
Not so good news for
the man who convicted him

36:59.505 --> 37:01.238
Judge Raymond Calverick.

37:01.240 --> 37:04.674
The D.A. has vowed to
reopen all cases tainted

37:04.676 --> 37:06.576
by this extralegal cabal,

37:06.578 --> 37:09.679
including deceased
Detective Stu Donnelly

37:09.681 --> 37:11.581
and prosecutor Angus Stanton.

37:19.391 --> 37:21.558
You're right behind me, aren't you?

37:21.560 --> 37:23.660
Where is she?

37:23.662 --> 37:26.696
I... you know, she just left.

37:26.698 --> 37:30.367
- Uh, how can I put this?
- You let her escape?

37:30.369 --> 37:32.702
I know you said to hold onto her,

37:32.704 --> 37:34.371
but my stepdad is her boss,

37:34.373 --> 37:37.240
and I'm running a little
short on family right now,

37:37.242 --> 37:39.442
not that you asked
about my personal life,

37:39.444 --> 37:41.111
but it's a mess.

37:41.113 --> 37:42.612
The last thing I need
is him shutting down

37:42.614 --> 37:44.514
the one good thing I have going on.

37:44.516 --> 37:46.883
Thank you for saving her life.

37:46.885 --> 37:50.253
Oh. Yeah. It's, like, my thing.

37:51.589 --> 37:55.759
Hey. FYI, she knows who you are.

37:55.761 --> 37:59.062
Hey. Chill. She didn't tell me,

37:59.064 --> 38:01.464
but I got the distinct impression

38:01.466 --> 38:03.800
that she's gonna tell my stepdad,

38:03.802 --> 38:05.535
so good luck with that.

38:18.583 --> 38:20.550
Well, Bruce, now I know how much

38:20.552 --> 38:22.619
it must have hurt hearing
your uncle blame you

38:22.621 --> 38:24.821
for what happened on the bridge,

38:24.823 --> 38:27.457
but he had to blame someone.

38:27.459 --> 38:29.926
Seeing him fight so
hard to avoid the truth

38:29.928 --> 38:31.828
that was right in front of him

38:31.830 --> 38:35.899
made me realize I was
doing the same thing.

38:35.901 --> 38:39.603
I've been blaming my dad
for not saving Beth that day,

38:40.205 --> 38:44.307
but it wasn't his hand on that
door only inches away from her.

38:46.745 --> 38:48.511
He wasn't the one who crossed that house

38:48.513 --> 38:52.315
off the list of places
where Beth could be.

39:01.326 --> 39:03.760
I don't know how,

39:03.762 --> 39:06.463
but we are gonna get Beth back,

39:06.465 --> 39:10.266
and this time, I swear to you

39:10.268 --> 39:11.968
I won't ever give up.

39:17.109 --> 39:18.875
I don't know if forgiving my father

39:18.877 --> 39:22.712
will help me forgive
myself, but I have to try.

39:47.952 --> 39:50.386
I thought I might find you here.

39:56.127 --> 40:02.165
How could you ever think I was
trying to replace you, little Mouse.

40:02.167 --> 40:06.069
Why are you so
determined to protect her?

40:06.071 --> 40:10.240
Because I'm saving her
a seat at our tea party!

40:10.242 --> 40:14.611
It was supposed to be a table for two.

40:14.613 --> 40:19.315
Yes, the two of us,

40:19.317 --> 40:22.952
two halves of one whole

40:22.954 --> 40:24.654
just as Kate and I are two halves,

40:24.656 --> 40:27.090
and I need your help to make us whole.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.292
I can't do this without you.

40:29.294 --> 40:33.930
I don't want to share you with her.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.532
Mouse.

40:41.972 --> 40:45.475
You won't have to share me

40:45.477 --> 40:48.111
because we'll be sharing her.

40:51.282 --> 40:54.284
And what if she doesn't want to play?

40:54.286 --> 40:57.287
Well...

40:57.289 --> 41:00.456
Then it's good we have that then, hmm?

41:07.898 --> 41:11.134
Trade you Mr. Pandy for it.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.203
You kept it?

41:13.205 --> 41:15.338
To remind me of you.
