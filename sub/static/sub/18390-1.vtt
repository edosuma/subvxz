03:13.177 --> 03:16.639
To everything
there is a season.

03:16.639 --> 03:19.475
A time to be born,
and a time to die.

03:19.475 --> 03:23.228
Time to love,
and a time to hate.

03:23.228 --> 03:26.856
A time to keep silence,
and a time to speak.

03:31.235 --> 03:33.029
A time to cast away stones,

03:33.029 --> 03:36.282
and a time
to gather stones together.

03:36.282 --> 03:39.243
A time to kill,
and a time to heal.

03:40.619 --> 03:44.122
A time to break down,
and a time to build up.

03:44.122 --> 03:48.668
A time to weep,
and a time to laugh.

03:48.668 --> 03:50.503
A time to mourn.

04:04.182 --> 04:07.769
(Screaming off screen)

04:43.500 --> 04:45.582
I know.

04:45.582 --> 04:47.997
I know, girl,
that's what I'm talking about.

04:47.997 --> 04:49.704
I mean, he would have
straightened up his act by now,

04:49.704 --> 04:51.078
and he just didn't.

04:51.078 --> 04:55.575
I just don't have time
for these games, Charmaine.

04:55.575 --> 04:57.449
No.

04:57.449 --> 05:00.322
No, I'm fine.

05:00.322 --> 05:02.113
I'm fine.

05:10.357 --> 05:13.939
I mean, once he sees what's
really out there, he'll know.

05:15.978 --> 05:18.894
No, I think I'm just gonna go
back home.

05:18.894 --> 05:20.434
I think I might take
the semester off

05:20.434 --> 05:21.642
and hang around the house.

05:21.642 --> 05:23.516
(Police siren)

05:23.516 --> 05:25.014
Oh, shit.

05:25.014 --> 05:26.222
Shit, I gotta go, Charmaine.

05:26.222 --> 05:27.805
I think I'm getting pulled over.

05:30.605 --> 05:32.394
Oh, man!

05:48.623 --> 05:50.411
Damn it!

05:54.073 --> 05:55.239
God.

06:08.638 --> 06:10.511
Oh, God.

06:14.698 --> 06:16.153
What did I do?

06:16.153 --> 06:17.567
Well, ma'am,

06:17.609 --> 06:21.145
it looks like you can't seem
to drive in a straight line.

06:21.145 --> 06:23.556
Listen, I was just getting
a little tired.

06:23.556 --> 06:24.597
It won't happen again.

06:24.597 --> 06:25.886
Promise.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.298
Well, pumpkin,
I don't think that promise

06:28.298 --> 06:30.545
is gonna keep the rest of the
motorists on this road safe.

06:34.608 --> 06:38.970
I think they'll be okay.

06:38.970 --> 06:40.631
(Laughing)

06:40.631 --> 06:42.958
Look, I only have 100 more miles
to my mom's house in Ascension.

06:42.958 --> 06:44.370
Can you just please let me go?

06:44.370 --> 06:46.198
Yeah, well...

06:49.564 --> 06:51.891
Now what do we got here?

06:51.891 --> 06:53.304
Looks like you started the party
a little early, huh?

06:53.304 --> 06:54.965
(Laughing)

06:54.965 --> 06:57.042
I was just trying to stay awake.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.830
Sorry.

06:58.830 --> 07:02.320
I'm gonna have to ask you
to step out of the car, ma'am.

07:02.320 --> 07:03.524
I'm really sorry.

07:03.524 --> 07:04.730
I mean, it won't happen--

07:04.730 --> 07:06.641
Step out of the goddamn car!

07:06.641 --> 07:07.595
Please,
I've just never been--

07:07.595 --> 07:08.552
Get out of this goddamn car.

07:08.552 --> 07:09.466
(Screaming)

07:09.466 --> 07:10.505
Get and turn around,
and hug that!

07:10.505 --> 07:11.584
Spread your legs!

07:11.584 --> 07:13.704
Spread it and shut up!

07:13.704 --> 07:15.573
(Crying)

07:18.564 --> 07:20.351
Turn around.

07:20.351 --> 07:22.428
I said turn around!

07:27.040 --> 07:28.286
(Laughing)

07:28.286 --> 07:30.904
You know,
I got a daughter your age,

07:30.904 --> 07:34.851
and I'd hate like hell
to see you spend the night

07:34.851 --> 07:36.513
in a dirty, stinking
holding cell,

07:36.513 --> 07:38.964
'cause I know you wouldn't
want to have to squat

07:38.964 --> 07:40.543
that pretty little ass of yours

07:40.543 --> 07:41.541
on some dirty toilet seat.

07:41.541 --> 07:42.745
No.

07:45.113 --> 07:48.521
What are you saying?

07:48.521 --> 07:51.387
I can't let you back on my road.

07:51.387 --> 07:53.921
I'm gonna have
to take your car keys.

07:53.921 --> 07:56.207
What am I supposed to do?

08:01.954 --> 08:03.075
Easy.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.311
Well, I tell you what.

08:07.311 --> 08:11.050
I could just give you a ride
down the road to a motel.

08:11.050 --> 08:15.245
You could spend the night
on me.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.985
I'll pay.

08:17.985 --> 08:19.937
And then in the morning when
you're all sobered up,

08:19.937 --> 08:23.011
I'll give you your keys back,
and you can just be on your way.

08:23.011 --> 08:25.296
But I need to get home.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.832
I just need to get home.

08:29.932 --> 08:32.174
Is your mama expecting you?

08:34.869 --> 08:37.154
No, she was already asleep.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.631
Well, now you got two choices.

08:42.631 --> 08:44.292
Go to the motel or go to jail.

08:49.935 --> 08:52.425
I'll take the motel.

08:52.425 --> 08:55.995
That's right.

08:55.995 --> 08:58.484
Right this way, seÃ±orita.

09:01.484 --> 09:03.806
Come on.

09:19.815 --> 09:22.011
Carter, glad to see
you could make it.

09:22.011 --> 09:24.664
I've only been waiting an hour.

09:24.664 --> 09:27.194
Yeah, well, time's getting
scarce nowadays.

09:27.194 --> 09:30.554
I guess it is,
all that money you making.

09:30.554 --> 09:34.286
You keep your goddamn eyes
off my pockets, Freddie.

09:37.478 --> 09:39.179
Are we gonna do some business,

09:39.179 --> 09:41.957
or just stand here and shoot
the breeze all fucking day?

09:41.957 --> 09:44.943
Got some new clients for you.

09:44.943 --> 09:46.478
Some real high-rollers.

09:51.048 --> 09:53.661
I need names and addresses
and social security numbers,

09:53.661 --> 09:54.613
and all that kind of thing.

09:54.613 --> 09:57.431
Carter.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.254
I got a truckload of Mexicans.

09:59.254 --> 10:00.748
Snagged them when
they were trying

10:00.748 --> 10:02.863
to make it across the border
in a U-Haul.

10:02.863 --> 10:05.182
You snagged them yourself, huh?

10:05.182 --> 10:08.457
Yeah.

10:08.457 --> 10:10.986
15 of them amigos.

10:10.986 --> 10:14.839
Got them in a safe house
down in Waco.

10:16.705 --> 10:20.310
I figured that you can put on
a pretty show

10:20.310 --> 10:21.883
with those Speedy Gonzales
mother-fuckers.

10:21.883 --> 10:22.878
You know,
running for their life.

10:27.156 --> 10:29.266
How much?

10:33.573 --> 10:37.840
$500 a piece,
for the whole motherlode.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.331
Even got a couple of teenagers.

10:42.646 --> 10:44.633
(Crashing)

10:44.633 --> 10:45.628
What the hell's the matter
with you?

10:46.994 --> 10:49.728
No kids!

10:49.728 --> 10:53.248
Goddamn it, you hear me?

10:53.248 --> 10:55.648
Ugh!

10:59.418 --> 11:00.826
I'll give you $250.

11:00.826 --> 11:04.389
You let them damn kids go.

11:04.389 --> 11:06.957
I want everybody else here
in less than 12 hours.

11:06.957 --> 11:09.110
You can stop at Sonic
on the way back.

11:09.110 --> 11:10.569
Get me a cherry limeade.

11:32.830 --> 11:34.690
God, my eyes
are like 1,000 pounds.

11:34.690 --> 11:37.672
I told you you wouldn't be able
to get any work done in the car.

11:37.672 --> 11:39.408
Why don't you just shut the
computer and put it away?

11:39.408 --> 11:43.423
Way to support
your wife there, Don.

11:43.423 --> 11:45.119
God, I told you
I had a deadline.

11:45.119 --> 11:46.485
Can you just give
a damn once, please?

11:47.932 --> 11:49.132
It's not that I don't give
a damn, Nancy.

11:49.132 --> 11:51.697
It's that we're on vacation.

11:51.697 --> 11:53.433
And when you're on vacation,
you don't work.

11:53.433 --> 11:55.833
That's, uh, why they call it
a vacation.

11:55.833 --> 11:59.309
You know, it never ceases
to amaze me

11:59.309 --> 12:01.087
that you always deem it
necessary

12:01.087 --> 12:05.346
to tell people what to do.

12:05.346 --> 12:07.624
May I remind you that making
a stupid website 10 years ago

12:07.624 --> 12:10.310
does not make you the dictator
of everyone.

12:16.102 --> 12:17.715
Why don't we pull over
at the next place?

12:17.715 --> 12:19.121
Grab some coffee and a couple
of those beignets you like?

12:21.152 --> 12:23.177
I hate those beignets.

12:23.177 --> 12:24.417
I do not want to pull over.

12:24.417 --> 12:25.741
I just want to get there,
please.

12:25.741 --> 12:27.311
We're always rushing
everywhere, Nancy.

12:27.311 --> 12:29.502
Let's just mosey around
a bit

12:29.502 --> 12:32.853
and take in some
of the local flavor.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.630
Mosey?

12:42.981 --> 12:45.750
Stupid website, huh?

12:45.750 --> 12:47.360
Well, next time you want to add

12:47.360 --> 12:49.180
to that shoe collection
of yours,

12:49.180 --> 12:50.957
or flash the American Express
Platinum card

12:50.957 --> 12:52.157
around the way you like to,

12:52.199 --> 12:53.480
we'll see how stupid you think
the website is.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.792
May I remind you
that I have been there

12:55.792 --> 12:57.735
from the very beginning?

12:57.735 --> 12:59.141
Who, who stayed up all night
doing research for you?

12:59.141 --> 13:01.203
Who watched every dime for you?

13:01.203 --> 13:03.189
Who told you to sell
those tech stocks

13:03.189 --> 13:04.842
before they took a nose dive?

13:04.842 --> 13:06.497
I have been cleaning
your shit-stained underwear

13:06.497 --> 13:07.569
for years, Don!

13:09.569 --> 13:11.634
I deserve every pair of shoes
in my collection,

13:11.634 --> 13:13.990
so don't make me feel bad
about it.

13:13.990 --> 13:15.476
If anything,
you should be supporting me

13:15.476 --> 13:18.368
in my career, you idiot!

13:18.368 --> 13:21.050
Just try not to act normal,
Nancy!

13:21.050 --> 13:23.076
Fucking arrogant bastard.

13:23.076 --> 13:24.315
Supposed to be a vacation.

13:38.771 --> 13:41.702
I'm--

13:41.702 --> 13:44.430
I'm sorry that I called
your website stupid.

13:49.183 --> 13:52.523
Whatever.

13:52.523 --> 13:53.720
Don't worry about it.

13:53.720 --> 13:57.062
Hey, hey!

14:02.053 --> 14:04.445
When did you stop listening?

14:04.445 --> 14:06.218
Okay, when did we stop listening
to each other?

14:10.299 --> 14:12.694
You haven't listened to a word
I've said in years.

14:12.694 --> 14:13.685
Stop.

14:13.685 --> 14:16.116
You know what?

14:16.116 --> 14:17.727
Fuck you.

14:17.727 --> 14:20.655
Fuck you.

14:20.655 --> 14:22.139
Yeah.

14:22.139 --> 14:23.212
Exactly.

14:23.212 --> 14:24.902
I thought we were talking about
listening, anyway.

14:24.902 --> 14:28.781
Listen to this, fuck you.

14:28.781 --> 14:30.099
Fuck you!

14:30.099 --> 14:31.089
No, fuck you.

14:31.089 --> 14:33.362
Fuck you.

14:33.362 --> 14:34.265
Stop it! Stop it!

14:34.265 --> 14:36.370
What are you, nuts?

14:36.370 --> 14:39.050
Get a hold of yourself.

14:39.050 --> 14:42.637
Jesus Christ.

15:01.739 --> 15:03.512
Hey!

15:38.855 --> 15:39.965
Yes, we're in the middle
of fucking nowhere!

15:39.965 --> 15:41.077
Can you just--

15:41.077 --> 15:42.273
Can you just send somebody,
please?

15:42.273 --> 15:44.623
Trace the call!

16:22.320 --> 16:24.173
Unbelievable,
it's been over an hour.

16:24.173 --> 16:26.888
Yeah, well, they probably had
to finish milking the cows

16:26.888 --> 16:29.316
before they headed out.

16:29.316 --> 16:31.290
Always on time
with the jokes there, Don.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.102
Well, you know,

16:33.102 --> 16:34.995
there's nothing like playing
to a friendly audience.

16:38.452 --> 16:39.601
I wish they'd get here soon.

16:39.601 --> 16:41.869
I would hate to see what would
come out of those woods.

17:31.208 --> 17:32.686
Thank you very much
for coming.

17:32.686 --> 17:34.164
We got hit.

17:34.164 --> 17:36.835
Some guy hit us twice
and drove off.

17:41.973 --> 17:43.987
Can you start her up?

17:43.987 --> 17:45.176
Well, it wouldn't start
earlier.

17:45.176 --> 17:47.271
But look,
I'll try it again.

17:55.527 --> 17:59.347
(Engine stalling)

18:01.647 --> 18:03.951
Pretty good-looking gal
you got there.

18:06.454 --> 18:08.385
Thanks.

18:08.385 --> 18:10.724
Y'all going on a road trip?

18:10.724 --> 18:13.188
Hey, did you call
a tow truck?

18:13.188 --> 18:14.995
Where you all going?

18:14.995 --> 18:16.185
The casino in Marksville.

18:17.460 --> 18:20.412
Hell, that's 100 miles back down
the road from where you came.

18:20.412 --> 18:21.275
No, it's not.

18:21.275 --> 18:22.714
Oh, yes, it is.

18:26.240 --> 18:28.660
Oh, come on.

18:28.660 --> 18:30.013
You told me
you'd been there before.

18:30.013 --> 18:31.776
GPS says it's this way.

18:34.686 --> 18:36.985
This ain't none of my business,
but pretty gal like that?

18:36.985 --> 18:39.606
You ought to be taking her to
a nicer place than Marksville.

18:42.313 --> 18:43.219
No disrespect.

18:43.219 --> 18:45.392
None taken.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.319
Can't afford to have pride on
a night like this, right?

18:47.319 --> 18:48.219
That's right.

18:48.219 --> 18:50.641
So, did you call
a tow truck?

18:50.641 --> 18:54.580
Oh, hell, you ain't gonna get
a tow truck

18:54.580 --> 18:56.422
this time of night
within a hundred miles.

18:56.422 --> 18:59.870
You'll have to wait until about
8 a.m. in the morning.

18:59.870 --> 19:01.304
8 a.m.?

19:01.304 --> 19:02.618
8 a.m.

19:02.618 --> 19:04.258
You're sure?

19:04.258 --> 19:07.622
I'm sure.

19:07.622 --> 19:11.026
Well, hell,
I'll tell you what.

19:11.026 --> 19:13.076
If you'd like, I can give you
and the pretty lady here

19:13.076 --> 19:15.373
a ride down to a little motel
about 15 minutes down the road.

19:17.502 --> 19:19.470
Get yourself a room,
get a good night's sleep

19:19.470 --> 19:20.658
and I'll make sure
you get a tow truck

19:20.698 --> 19:21.721
first thing in the morning.

19:21.721 --> 19:24.674
What about
a rental car company?

19:25.864 --> 19:29.469
Come on now, do I look like
I work for Enterprise?

19:29.469 --> 19:32.461
Hell, this time of night, I
should be sleeping in my car

19:32.461 --> 19:33.610
somewhere on the side
of the road.

19:33.610 --> 19:36.642
Now, if you wanna get your gear
and come with me,

19:36.642 --> 19:39.797
I'll take you down to that motel
if you'd like.

19:39.797 --> 19:43.241
Well, make up your mind, 'cause
I'm leaving in two minutes.

19:45.464 --> 19:47.471
Gotta protect and serve!

19:49.316 --> 19:51.692
We just need a minute
to gather our stuff.

19:57.342 --> 19:59.063
We're lucky he came.

19:59.063 --> 20:01.561
This is ridiculous,
absolutely--

20:01.561 --> 20:02.623
No, no, no!

20:02.623 --> 20:04.672
Do not take that thing.

20:04.672 --> 20:06.760
I hate that thing,
put it back.

20:06.760 --> 20:09.056
Put it down.

20:09.056 --> 20:11.717
You'll probably get arrested
or something.

20:45.318 --> 20:48.426
Â¶ Tell my mother
that I love her Â¶

20:48.426 --> 20:50.675
Â¶ Tell my lover
there ain't no other Â¶

20:50.675 --> 20:54.315
Â¶ Tell my brother I'll see him
down the road sometime Â¶

20:54.315 --> 20:55.788
Â¶ Oh my Â¶

20:55.788 --> 20:56.769
Â¶ My my my my Â¶

20:56.769 --> 20:58.160
Â¶ My my my Â¶

20:58.160 --> 21:00.530
Whoo!

21:00.530 --> 21:02.332
All right,
here we go folks.

21:03.885 --> 21:08.264
Welcome to the finest digs
in Parish.

21:08.264 --> 21:09.202
Oh, come on!

21:09.202 --> 21:10.062
Are you serious?

21:10.062 --> 21:13.785
Hey, it's not so bad.

21:13.785 --> 21:15.053
I'm sure you got yourself
one of those platinum cards

21:15.053 --> 21:18.078
you can just swipe,
swipe, swipe.

21:18.078 --> 21:19.346
Unbelievable

21:21.274 --> 21:23.992
I would rather stay in that car
than sleep in this shit hole.

21:23.992 --> 21:25.951
Well, you're gonna have yourself
a long walk,

21:25.951 --> 21:27.310
'cause as of now,
my shift is officially over.

21:31.307 --> 21:33.266
Who you calling now?

21:33.266 --> 21:35.865
911, this is a fucking
emergency!

21:37.264 --> 21:39.143
You're wasting your time, ma'am.

21:39.143 --> 21:41.142
As I said, I am the law,

21:41.142 --> 21:42.461
and I'm the only law in town.

21:42.461 --> 21:43.980
Great, now I don't even have
a signal.

21:43.980 --> 21:45.179
Don, give me your phone.

21:45.179 --> 21:48.777
Look, if you don't have a
signal, I'm not gonna have one.

21:51.689 --> 21:53.327
Great, this is just great.

21:53.327 --> 21:55.606
I'm stuck in the middle
of nowhere

21:55.606 --> 21:56.604
and I'm gonna catch crabs
tonight.

21:56.604 --> 21:59.323
Hey, this here's a fine
establishment.

21:59.323 --> 22:03.119
Matter of fact--

22:03.119 --> 22:05.956
I had my wedding
reception here.

22:05.956 --> 22:09.073
Now if you don't mind,
I've got business to tend to.

22:09.073 --> 22:11.431
On the side of the road,
right?

22:11.431 --> 22:13.709
Little something for my time?

22:13.709 --> 22:18.025
Go fuck yourself.

22:18.025 --> 22:19.943
Here.

22:19.943 --> 22:21.701
Unbelievable.

22:21.701 --> 22:23.140
We don't want any more trouble.

22:25.927 --> 22:28.442
Well, you don't start none,
there won't be none.

22:28.442 --> 22:30.399
Now you all sleep tight.

22:30.399 --> 22:32.874
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

22:32.874 --> 22:34.431
I'll get that car of yours
towed in the morning.

22:34.431 --> 22:37.027
In the meantime, I suggest you
wash this lady's mouth out.

22:39.462 --> 22:42.097
Now y'all get the hell
out of my car.

23:19.668 --> 23:22.500
Nice, Motel Royal Vista.

23:22.500 --> 23:25.490
This is really romantic, Don.

23:35.061 --> 23:37.892
They're probably sleeping.

23:37.892 --> 23:39.088
Like we should be.

23:39.088 --> 23:41.681
This is romantic,
thank you!

23:41.681 --> 23:44.275
These are the kind of moments
that bring people closer.

23:59.185 --> 24:02.174
Hello!

24:02.174 --> 24:03.209
Hello?

24:03.209 --> 24:05.958
Hello!

24:05.958 --> 24:07.313
Hello.

24:07.313 --> 24:10.021
Oh, my God.

24:10.021 --> 24:12.293
Oh, my God,
this place is disgusting!

24:24.274 --> 24:25.668
I am so sorry!

24:25.668 --> 24:29.648
Wasn't expecting anybody in
this late.

24:29.648 --> 24:31.518
This is our slow season.

24:31.518 --> 24:33.469
Yeah, I'll bet.

24:33.469 --> 24:36.332
Um, we had an accident
down the road.

24:36.332 --> 24:40.512
Sheriff brought us here,
said you could get us a room.

24:40.512 --> 24:42.421
The sheriff brought you here?

24:42.421 --> 24:43.853
Yeah, that creepy sheriff.

24:43.853 --> 24:45.644
He kicked us out of his car.

24:47.117 --> 24:50.380
Yeah, that old Cleveland can be
a real son of a bitch sometimes.

24:50.380 --> 24:53.325
You know, I sang in the choir,
third grade, with him.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.638
Couldn't carry a tune
to save his life.

24:54.638 --> 24:56.985
Yep, we heard.

24:58.140 --> 24:59.772
Uh, look, I don't want
to be rude,

24:59.772 --> 25:01.283
but we're pretty tired

25:01.283 --> 25:03.910
and we gotta get an early start
in the morning.

25:03.910 --> 25:06.258
So, uh, do you have a vacancy?

25:11.570 --> 25:13.041
Oh, sure, sure, sure!

25:13.041 --> 25:14.910
I forgot you big-city types

25:14.910 --> 25:18.805
don't always like
this small town chit-chat.

25:18.805 --> 25:21.947
Let me get you all fixed up.

25:21.947 --> 25:23.218
Can we get the cleanest room,
please?

25:23.218 --> 25:27.350
Around here,
we believe that cleanliness

25:27.350 --> 25:29.062
is next to godliness.

25:35.022 --> 25:36.254
Well, what do you need?

25:36.254 --> 25:37.960
King room would be ideal.

25:37.960 --> 25:40.943
King suite?

25:40.943 --> 25:45.153
$129.99.

25:45.153 --> 25:47.696
What?

25:47.696 --> 25:49.643
Oh, come on,
that's unbelievable!

25:49.643 --> 25:51.987
It is!

25:51.987 --> 25:54.848
We cater mostly
to the corporate type.

25:58.426 --> 26:01.321
A1 Trucking out of Appaloosas.

26:01.321 --> 26:02.709
It's our biggest customer,

26:02.709 --> 26:04.932
and they usually have us
full up.

26:04.932 --> 26:07.273
I'm sure.

26:07.273 --> 26:08.584
Take American Express?

26:08.584 --> 26:12.154
Oh, we gladly accept
all major credit cards.

26:12.154 --> 26:15.646
Great.

26:15.646 --> 26:18.027
Well, if you excuse me
for a minute,

26:18.027 --> 26:20.370
our credit card machine
is there in the back.

26:20.370 --> 26:22.113
I'll give it
a little swiping,

26:22.113 --> 26:23.066
be right back here.

26:23.066 --> 26:24.178
Don't you go anywhere.

26:50.464 --> 26:53.792
Uh, I'm really sorry,

26:53.792 --> 26:54.781
but there seems to be
some problem with your card.

26:54.781 --> 26:55.970
What?

26:55.970 --> 26:57.117
Problem?

26:57.117 --> 26:58.228
Can I use your phone?
Let me call them.

26:58.228 --> 26:59.733
Not to worry!

26:59.733 --> 27:02.745
It's kind of slow
around here tonight.

27:02.745 --> 27:06.625
You've already told me how you
two have had a tough evening.

27:06.625 --> 27:10.192
So your room tonight will be
complimentary, on us.

27:10.232 --> 27:12.808
Just a little old southern
hospitality!

27:15.779 --> 27:17.322
I can even turn on
those dirty movie channels

27:17.322 --> 27:20.850
if you want to blow off
a little steam.

27:20.850 --> 27:21.918
How thoughtful.

27:21.918 --> 27:22.909
We'll be okay.

27:22.909 --> 27:25.087
We just want to get some sleep.

27:28.653 --> 27:29.960
We're gonna need the key.

27:29.960 --> 27:31.584
Oh no, it's all friendly
around here.

27:31.584 --> 27:33.448
Nothing's locked up.

27:35.869 --> 27:37.293
You just take, uh, room 4.

27:37.293 --> 27:38.797
Just down the way there.

27:38.797 --> 27:40.301
Feel free to buzz me up front

27:40.301 --> 27:41.728
if you need anything at all.

27:41.728 --> 27:44.854
Dial 0, I'll be
at your beck and call.

27:44.854 --> 27:46.598
Thank you, good night.

27:49.722 --> 27:50.791
Sleep tight now!

28:31.118 --> 28:33.529
Dispatch, I'm in the area
and there's no car in sight.

28:33.529 --> 28:35.857
Are you sure
this is the right location?

28:35.857 --> 28:38.072
RADIO:
10-4, 313, mile marker 21.

28:38.072 --> 28:39.731
Looks like they must have got it
up and running.

28:39.731 --> 28:41.827
I'm heading back to my post.

28:41.827 --> 28:44.001
10-4.

28:53.840 --> 28:55.934
Oh, my God!

28:55.934 --> 28:58.343
Ugh, I'm definitely catching
a disease tonight.

29:00.987 --> 29:02.448
Well, I tell you after 8 years
in the marine corps,

29:02.448 --> 29:03.358
it'd take a lot worse than this
to scare me.

29:03.358 --> 29:05.528
Aren't you the macho man?

29:08.649 --> 29:12.045
Maybe I can sleep standing up
like a giraffe.

29:12.045 --> 29:13.939
Well, you already sleepwalk,

29:13.939 --> 29:16.029
so it would be
the next natural step.

29:16.029 --> 29:19.229
Maybe I could break
the world's record

29:21.637 --> 29:24.282
with saying "Fuck you"
enough times in one night.

29:24.282 --> 29:26.609
No, I think you've already
achieved that goal, Nancy.

29:26.609 --> 29:29.685
You may want to set the bar
a little higher.

29:29.685 --> 29:31.382
TV's broken.

29:31.382 --> 29:35.446
Oh my God, what is that?

29:35.746 --> 29:36.868
Don, there's blood on the wall!

29:40.812 --> 29:44.121
You sure?

29:44.121 --> 29:46.323
There's blood on the wall!

29:49.987 --> 29:51.406
Yeah, it's still wet.

29:51.406 --> 29:53.651
Ugh!

29:53.651 --> 29:56.329
Those A1 truckers
must like it rough.

29:56.329 --> 29:58.731
I am not staying here.

30:02.865 --> 30:04.679
Huh.

30:10.274 --> 30:12.243
We are leaving at 7:45 a.m.

30:12.243 --> 30:13.266
No later!

30:13.266 --> 30:15.826
That was the plan.

30:15.826 --> 30:19.645
He didn't turn the porn on.

30:19.645 --> 30:21.339
Well, let's get some sleep.

30:28.573 --> 30:29.753
Oh, bed's comfortable.

30:41.601 --> 30:44.828
You're taking way
too much time, Jonas.

30:47.328 --> 30:48.349
God, Cleveland!

30:48.349 --> 30:50.120
Will you just let me log in?

30:50.120 --> 30:53.659
Why you always move so slow?

30:53.659 --> 30:55.784
I'm going as fast as I can.

31:01.366 --> 31:03.725
Well, better hurry up
because we got a lot to do.

31:03.725 --> 31:04.902
We ain't got much time.

31:04.902 --> 31:06.240
I'm hurrying, all right?

31:06.240 --> 31:07.576
I almost got the list
sent out to everybody.

31:07.576 --> 31:08.874
The whole list, all right?

31:17.330 --> 31:19.448
There, it's gone.

31:19.448 --> 31:20.706
It's about time.

31:23.494 --> 31:24.478
You idiot.

31:29.150 --> 31:33.473
Yes, sir, we can get a private
room for the congressman.

31:33.473 --> 31:35.832
That's right.

31:35.832 --> 31:37.478
From now on,

31:37.478 --> 31:41.210
he's gonna be known
as, uh, R15.

31:41.210 --> 31:43.489
Yeah, that's right.

32:23.991 --> 32:25.869
Don, put that down.

32:25.869 --> 32:27.200
That's disgusting.

32:27.200 --> 32:29.863
It's right
on the bar of soap.

32:29.863 --> 32:31.586
It's gross,
put that down!

32:31.586 --> 32:33.272
How did it get there?

32:33.272 --> 32:34.916
That's an article
you could write.

32:34.916 --> 32:35.972
Thrilling.

32:35.972 --> 32:38.988
You can almost see yourself
in this mirror.

32:40.985 --> 32:42.707
Huh.

32:45.682 --> 32:49.715
Well, been an interesting
evening.

33:37.044 --> 33:39.662
Morning cannot come
soon enough.

33:45.249 --> 33:47.474
You know what this
reminds me of?

33:52.008 --> 33:54.237
Summer vacation bible school.

33:57.059 --> 33:58.892
What?

33:58.892 --> 34:00.570
Remember?

34:00.570 --> 34:03.066
The boys and girls had to sleep
in separate cabins,

34:03.066 --> 34:04.393
and for good reason.

34:04.393 --> 34:07.632
And you snuck into mine.

34:07.632 --> 34:08.844
We were so scared all we did
was hold each other

34:08.844 --> 34:10.130
and talk all night.

34:10.130 --> 34:11.261
We didn't even kiss.

34:12.159 --> 34:16.453
That's because
you were too scared.

34:16.453 --> 34:17.351
Oh, you were scared too.

34:19.456 --> 34:22.502
But when you finally did,
a week later...

34:26.717 --> 34:29.761
your lips were trembling.

34:42.397 --> 34:43.451
Where did we go wrong?

34:51.360 --> 34:55.527
Do you think I wanted it
to be like this?

34:55.527 --> 34:58.918
Every girl wants the perfect
marriage and the perfect family.

34:58.918 --> 35:03.046
Nancy, I said I was sorry.

35:06.619 --> 35:08.604
I made a mistake.

35:08.604 --> 35:10.238
I'm sorry.

35:10.238 --> 35:14.560
Counselor said we just need
to relearn to communicate.

35:17.007 --> 35:19.301
That's why we went
on this trip, Nancy.

35:19.301 --> 35:22.804
But all you've done so far
is yell at me.

35:22.804 --> 35:25.842
What am I supposed to do
with all the anger?

35:32.880 --> 35:35.956
I made a mistake.

35:35.956 --> 35:38.055
A big one.

35:42.093 --> 35:45.083
That is the truest thing
that you have said all night.

35:48.268 --> 35:50.212
You know, I'm the one
popping Paxil.

35:50.212 --> 35:52.852
I'm the one popping
fertility drugs.

35:52.852 --> 35:55.298
I'm the one doing everything
that I can.

35:55.298 --> 35:56.699
I can't just stop feelings.

36:01.978 --> 36:03.374
I want to make it work.

36:03.374 --> 36:05.436
Baby, I'm gonna make it up
to you.

36:05.436 --> 36:06.290
Just give me another chance.

36:06.290 --> 36:08.619
I am just so angry.

36:08.619 --> 36:10.677
I'm angry at everybody
and everything,

36:10.677 --> 36:12.658
and I am not an angry person.

36:12.658 --> 36:14.175
I do not want to be
an angry person.

36:14.175 --> 36:17.706
And you're the one who made me
an angry person.

36:24.903 --> 36:28.312
I guess somebody checked in
next door.

36:28.312 --> 36:29.748
Yeah, checked in with a bang.

36:32.153 --> 36:34.865
God!

36:36.454 --> 36:38.160
What the hell?

36:44.443 --> 36:46.572
Hey, mind your own business.

36:53.629 --> 36:56.496
I want what they're drinking.

36:56.496 --> 36:58.707
Hey, I got an idea for you.

36:58.707 --> 37:00.995
You should write an article.

37:04.605 --> 37:06.460
Great sex in nasty hotels.

37:09.131 --> 37:11.959
I could probably win
the Pulitzer with that one.

37:13.350 --> 37:14.862
Holy shit.

37:14.862 --> 37:16.410
That's enough.

37:16.410 --> 37:17.685
Go talk to them.

37:17.685 --> 37:18.693
You want me to go over there?

37:18.693 --> 37:20.125
Yes!

37:20.125 --> 37:22.095
We're not gonna put up
with that all night.

37:22.095 --> 37:24.268
Go talk to them.

37:24.268 --> 37:25.973
All right.

37:46.223 --> 37:47.306
Sir, may I help you?

37:47.306 --> 37:49.275
Yeah, look, I'm, uh, sorry
to disturb you,

37:49.275 --> 37:51.670
but, um, I'm in the next room

37:51.670 --> 37:53.638
and my wife and I have just been
to hell and back

37:53.638 --> 37:55.533
and well, we've been through
a rough night.

37:55.533 --> 37:58.467
Just appreciate it if you could
keep the noise down.

37:58.467 --> 38:00.361
Yeah, sure.

38:00.361 --> 38:02.252
Sorry to disturb you.

38:02.252 --> 38:04.417
Thanks.

38:04.454 --> 38:05.961
Hey!

38:05.961 --> 38:08.744
I'll give you $1,000
if you drive us into town?

38:13.512 --> 38:14.939
No, no, no thank you.

38:30.283 --> 38:31.362
What'd they say?

38:31.362 --> 38:32.289
They said they'd tone it down.

38:32.289 --> 38:34.677
Thank you.

38:34.677 --> 38:36.295
Yep.

38:40.383 --> 38:41.925
Maybe we can get a little
shut-eye before morning.

38:41.925 --> 38:42.887
Yeah.

38:57.568 --> 39:00.144
I got you covered.

39:00.144 --> 39:02.071
Yeah, no problem.

39:02.071 --> 39:04.337
Same place as before, right?

39:04.337 --> 39:06.028
Same place.

39:20.457 --> 39:21.958
You back again, huh?

39:28.070 --> 39:30.645
I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

39:34.677 --> 39:36.019
Have fun, boys.

40:04.352 --> 40:06.385
I got you something better
than those ponchos.

40:07.418 --> 40:09.684
Yeah, besides they sell for more
as sex slaves.

40:09.684 --> 40:10.796
Yeah.

40:10.796 --> 40:13.059
Got you this one.

40:13.059 --> 40:15.089
Ah, how about this?

40:15.089 --> 40:16.546
Oh!

40:16.546 --> 40:18.852
Fresh shipment of young hookers
from the Ukraine,

40:18.852 --> 40:20.009
or former Yugoslavia.

40:20.509 --> 40:21.980
Who cares, huh?

40:25.370 --> 40:27.973
You can't beat this
with a bat, man.

40:27.973 --> 40:29.580
How much?

40:29.580 --> 40:32.340
A thousand a piece.

40:32.340 --> 40:33.220
Oh, no, no, no, no.

40:33.220 --> 40:34.290
We said 250.

40:34.290 --> 40:36.969
But these here are, um,
multipurpose, man.

40:37.813 --> 40:39.880
Come on, look,
look what you got here.

40:39.880 --> 40:43.208
Okay, hey, hey,
I'm a businessman, you know?

40:44.394 --> 40:46.731
What, uh--

40:51.748 --> 40:54.157
You tell Carter Fairbanks
it's a pleasure.

40:54.157 --> 40:56.415
And maybe, uh,
maybe next year,

40:59.770 --> 41:01.338
I'll find out the location

41:01.338 --> 41:03.934
and I can be there
the night of the big show.

41:07.737 --> 41:10.580
The shit we get ourselves
into, huh?

41:12.811 --> 41:17.080
My grandmother told me to,
um, join the air force,

41:17.080 --> 41:19.658
stay single,
and be done with it.

41:19.658 --> 41:23.771
But no, I wanted to be
a journalist, look for love.

41:23.771 --> 41:26.350
Well, your grandmother
was a mean, lonely woman.

41:26.350 --> 41:28.078
She was a 4-star general.

41:34.120 --> 41:36.230
Oh, for crying out loud.

41:38.690 --> 41:39.687
Forget it, I'm not--

41:39.687 --> 41:40.839
No, no, no, no, no,
go please!

41:42.913 --> 41:46.945
All right.

41:46.945 --> 41:48.328
Thank you.

43:33.772 --> 43:34.827
What's going on?

43:34.827 --> 43:36.070
Shit!

43:36.070 --> 43:37.475
You gotta stay calm, okay?

43:37.475 --> 43:39.581
Don't ask any questions.

43:39.581 --> 43:43.172
Just do what I tell you to do,
okay?

43:43.172 --> 43:46.991
Tell me what's going on!

43:46.991 --> 43:48.942
Don, what is going on?

43:50.736 --> 43:53.584
You gotta tell me
what's going on!

43:53.584 --> 43:55.728
They killed a girl.

43:57.909 --> 43:58.805
What?

43:58.805 --> 43:59.661
Right next door,
they killed somebody!

44:10.686 --> 44:12.476
I saw them through the window.

44:12.476 --> 44:13.409
That's crazy!

44:18.451 --> 44:19.537
Get in the closet!
Get in the closet!

44:19.537 --> 44:20.862
We got a good one.

44:20.862 --> 44:22.652
Go!

45:00.987 --> 45:02.540
Nancy!

45:02.540 --> 45:03.358
I think they're gone.

45:06.030 --> 45:07.118
Are you sure?

45:07.118 --> 45:08.438
Yeah, come here.

45:08.438 --> 45:09.408
You see that Buick?

45:09.408 --> 45:10.300
Yeah.

45:10.300 --> 45:13.439
That's our escape right there.

45:13.439 --> 45:15.845
I can hotwire it.

45:15.845 --> 45:17.205
Okay.

45:17.205 --> 45:19.026
All right.

45:19.026 --> 45:21.627
Let's get the fuck out of here,
all right?

45:27.046 --> 45:27.941
Ready?

45:40.486 --> 45:43.857
Look, that car.

45:43.896 --> 45:46.026
Maybe the keys are under
the visor or something.

45:46.026 --> 45:47.303
Looks good there,
let's go.

45:59.658 --> 46:01.752
This way!

46:01.752 --> 46:03.410
Oh, my God!

46:04.455 --> 46:05.769
Come on!

46:06.969 --> 46:09.869
Ahh!

46:33.286 --> 46:34.521
Holy fuck!

46:34.521 --> 46:37.724
Oh, my God,
what are we going to do?

46:37.724 --> 46:39.691
Fuck!

46:51.873 --> 46:53.145
Well, hello there,
big-city boy!

46:53.145 --> 46:55.342
Looks like you found yourself

46:55.342 --> 46:56.607
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

46:56.607 --> 46:57.881
What do you want?

46:57.881 --> 46:58.807
You want money?

46:58.807 --> 46:59.731
I can get you money!

46:59.731 --> 47:00.615
I can get you $1000 cash.

47:00.615 --> 47:02.194
Take me to an ATM right now!

47:02.194 --> 47:03.929
Now what makes you think
I want your money?

47:03.929 --> 47:05.738
Why are you doing this, huh?

47:07.801 --> 47:09.073
What kind of sick shit is this?

47:09.073 --> 47:10.454
What are you doing this for?

47:10.454 --> 47:11.644
Hey now, who you calling sick?

47:11.644 --> 47:14.148
You're the one who
almost killed somebody.

47:14.148 --> 47:15.495
So you want to play rough,
city boy, huh?

47:15.495 --> 47:17.302
Tell him that my dad's
a U.S. Senator.

47:17.302 --> 47:18.149
Tell him!

47:18.149 --> 47:20.151
Hey, little lady there!

47:20.151 --> 47:21.765
Even the President
of the United States of America

47:21.765 --> 47:23.304
ain't gonna get you
out of this fix.

47:24.423 --> 47:26.844
What the fuck did
we ever do to you?

47:26.844 --> 47:28.382
You sound like a gambling man,

47:28.382 --> 47:30.767
since you was going
to the casino and all.

47:33.246 --> 47:35.281
So how about we-- how about we
make ourselves a little bet?

47:35.281 --> 47:36.515
How about that?

47:36.515 --> 47:37.779
What?

47:37.779 --> 47:39.624
Did you see that white Buick
out in the parking lot?

47:39.624 --> 47:40.852
I know you saw it
when we was coming in.

47:40.852 --> 47:41.929
We call her old Betsy.

47:41.929 --> 47:44.692
She got about a, oh,
a half tank of gas in there.

47:44.692 --> 47:45.692
That ought to get you
to Lafayette,

47:45.692 --> 47:48.263
where your wife can take
a nice, hot shower.

47:48.263 --> 47:49.843
They even sell beer
after midnight.

47:51.262 --> 47:53.027
Key's under the visor.

47:53.027 --> 47:55.411
What do you say?

47:58.112 --> 48:00.260
What's the bet?

48:00.260 --> 48:02.212
Well, the bet is if you make it
to the car,

48:02.212 --> 48:03.744
you can drive out of here.

48:03.744 --> 48:05.857
And if you don't?

48:05.857 --> 48:07.967
Well, you don't!

48:08.961 --> 48:11.910
How do we know the car runs?

48:11.910 --> 48:13.412
'Cause I'm a man of my word,
goddamn it!

48:13.412 --> 48:15.290
I'm the law!

48:15.290 --> 48:17.662
I took an oath!

48:23.348 --> 48:25.994
Jesus, you scared the shit
out of me, Cleveland.

48:25.994 --> 48:29.511
What?

48:29.511 --> 48:31.311
What is it?

48:31.346 --> 48:33.106
He said there's a car out here.

48:33.106 --> 48:34.559
A car?

48:47.955 --> 48:49.160
Come on.

48:53.822 --> 48:56.145
All right.

48:56.145 --> 48:58.707
I saw him going
around the corner.

48:58.707 --> 48:59.756
Let's go.

48:59.756 --> 49:00.611
Over there?

49:03.249 --> 49:04.259
Oh, my God!

49:04.259 --> 49:07.012
Can you see it?

49:07.012 --> 49:09.456
It's right there,
all right?

49:09.456 --> 49:10.698
Okay.

49:10.698 --> 49:11.903
Let's go.

49:11.903 --> 49:13.375
No, wait!
What?

49:13.375 --> 49:16.524
It's too easy.

49:16.524 --> 49:19.548
Well, what other choice
do we have?

49:23.156 --> 49:25.022
Okay.

49:28.983 --> 49:30.338
Don, Don!

49:30.338 --> 49:32.117
Oh, my God!
Come on!

49:39.857 --> 49:41.639
Ahh!

49:41.639 --> 49:43.417
Go, go!

49:43.417 --> 49:44.772
Argh!

50:07.731 --> 50:08.853
Check the window.

50:12.787 --> 50:14.484
Oh, my God,
they're gone.

50:32.846 --> 50:33.928
I love you.

50:33.928 --> 50:35.706
I love you too.

50:35.706 --> 50:37.396
I love you.

51:04.786 --> 51:06.864
I see, compadre,
you got some cojones.

51:07.898 --> 51:09.051
Hell, this is gonna be
more fun than I thought.

51:09.051 --> 51:12.510
You told me if we made it
to the car, we could go.

51:12.510 --> 51:15.661
I'm gonna have to delegate
that answer to my associate.

51:15.661 --> 51:17.459
Sorry, brother.

51:17.459 --> 51:19.423
I decided to change my mind.

51:19.423 --> 51:21.920
Hey, you listen to me,
you sick fuck!

51:24.492 --> 51:26.140
You think this is a game?

51:26.140 --> 51:28.435
We're gonna change the rules
a little.

51:28.435 --> 51:31.426
We're gonna let my wife go,
and then I'm gonna give up.

51:31.426 --> 51:32.617
I'm gonna make it easy on you.

51:32.617 --> 51:33.919
Young man, I make the rules
around here.

51:33.919 --> 51:35.298
You live when I say you live,

51:35.298 --> 51:36.447
and you die
when I say you die--

51:40.167 --> 51:42.890
We are gonna die in here.

51:42.890 --> 51:44.694
Listen to me,
listen to me.

51:44.694 --> 51:45.613
We are not gonna die.

51:48.216 --> 51:51.005
We just need a plan.

51:51.005 --> 51:52.309
So, look around,
check in the drawers.

51:52.309 --> 51:54.949
Look for something,
anything, all right?

52:02.253 --> 52:06.120
Wait a minute.

52:06.120 --> 52:10.022
If he called us,
maybe we can call out.

52:19.827 --> 52:21.538
Dial tone.

52:26.619 --> 52:29.041
It's ringing.

52:29.041 --> 52:30.367
Hello!

52:30.367 --> 52:33.452
Hello, listen, somebody
is trying to kill us!

52:33.452 --> 52:35.479
We're at the Motel Royal Vista!

52:35.479 --> 52:37.006
Route 16, Garcia Parish.

52:37.006 --> 52:38.141
Didn't your mama ever tell you

52:38.141 --> 52:40.983
that it wasn't nice
to be a tattle tale?

52:40.983 --> 52:42.005
Hmm?

52:42.005 --> 52:43.759
Well, it's not.

52:43.759 --> 52:47.547
Now you're gonna have to get
a little spanking.

52:47.547 --> 52:49.697
Go on over there
and look out that window.

53:06.886 --> 53:09.024
Yeah, that's just in case

53:09.024 --> 53:10.783
the state troopers
come snooping around,

53:10.783 --> 53:13.153
or maybe some detective
wondering what happened to you.

53:13.153 --> 53:16.504
Look, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

53:16.504 --> 53:18.333
If you call this thing off,

53:18.333 --> 53:21.133
first thing in the morning,
we can call my banker.

53:21.133 --> 53:23.002
I'll have a quarter of a million
dollars wired into your account

53:23.002 --> 53:24.761
Anywhere, anywhere you want!

53:24.761 --> 53:27.170
No questions asked.

53:31.567 --> 53:35.838
Hey, big-city boy,
didn't your mama ever tell you

53:35.838 --> 53:39.873
all the finer things in life
are free?

53:39.873 --> 53:42.078
Listen to me,
you are gonna burn in hell!

53:42.078 --> 53:44.761
You are gonna burn in fucking
hell, you mother-fucker!

53:44.761 --> 53:46.043
Yeah.

53:52.131 --> 53:53.370
We're out of time.

53:53.370 --> 53:54.304
We got to do something.

53:54.304 --> 53:55.117
We got to do it now.

54:02.335 --> 54:04.042
Come in.

54:06.138 --> 54:07.027
Got your cut, boss.

54:07.027 --> 54:07.883
It's about time.

54:13.324 --> 54:14.566
Well, you know,
I just love the smell of--

54:14.566 --> 54:17.278
Mmm, blood money.

54:17.278 --> 54:19.018
Yes, sir.

54:19.018 --> 54:22.576
Comes fast, spends fast.

54:22.576 --> 54:24.319
Almost like the days
of Ancient Rome

54:24.319 --> 54:28.577
when gladiators used to fight
to the death.

54:28.577 --> 54:29.545
Why, yes, sir.

54:29.545 --> 54:31.016
Yes, sir, just like them
gladiators.

54:31.016 --> 54:34.497
Entertained the crowds.

54:34.497 --> 54:36.204
Any way you slice it,

54:38.287 --> 54:40.922
people will always pay money
to see blood hit the floor.

54:44.638 --> 54:46.027
Pays better than pussy.

54:46.027 --> 54:48.809
Better than poon tang?

54:48.809 --> 54:50.502
Shh, I don't know
about all that.

54:50.502 --> 54:51.546
Trust me.

54:51.546 --> 54:52.468
You're right.

54:52.468 --> 54:54.400
You take care
of them VIP customers?

54:54.400 --> 54:55.632
I did, I did.

54:55.632 --> 54:56.789
Took care of them very well.

54:56.789 --> 54:58.335
All right.

54:58.335 --> 55:00.997
Well, I am proud
to be an American.

55:00.997 --> 55:03.962
And I hope that you are too.

55:03.962 --> 55:05.319
I am.

55:05.319 --> 55:06.511
Well, take this from me,
it's a gift,

55:06.551 --> 55:09.215
and listen to it
every single day.

55:13.093 --> 55:15.936
And behave yourself.

55:22.434 --> 55:25.325
Okay, it's $10,000.

55:25.325 --> 55:26.774
It's your half.

55:33.919 --> 55:37.676
Supposed to be $12,000

55:37.676 --> 55:39.354
No, it's 10.

55:39.354 --> 55:41.580
You said you were gonna find me
some redheads this time.

55:41.580 --> 55:43.334
You know they like redheads.

55:43.334 --> 55:45.135
It's 12.

55:45.135 --> 55:47.287
Why don't you go to hell?

56:13.942 --> 56:16.702
I want two things, Jonas.

56:16.702 --> 56:18.842
$12,000 and respect.

56:23.236 --> 56:26.310
Because I am the law.

56:26.310 --> 56:28.878
Now, you better start figuring
out how you're gonna count

56:28.878 --> 56:31.207
another $2,000 off that stack,

56:31.207 --> 56:33.223
or I'm gonna have to figure out

56:33.223 --> 56:35.215
how I'm gonna wipe your brains
off that wall

56:35.215 --> 56:36.423
before we open in the morning.

56:39.797 --> 56:41.927
Now, hold on, Cleveland.

56:47.235 --> 56:49.833
Uh, I was just pulling
your chain, man.

56:49.833 --> 56:50.763
There.

56:50.763 --> 56:53.319
That's more than your share.

56:53.319 --> 56:55.065
It's all good.

56:56.307 --> 56:58.829
You ever tell me
to go to hell again,

56:58.829 --> 57:03.089
I swear to God
I will kill you on the spot.

57:03.089 --> 57:06.149
Never happen again.

57:09.912 --> 57:12.358
Goddamn, I'm--

57:12.358 --> 57:13.676
I'm getting thirsty.

57:20.069 --> 57:22.235
Couple beers?

57:22.235 --> 57:23.705
That's a good idea.

57:23.705 --> 57:25.367
Yeah, sounds good.

57:44.613 --> 57:45.935
Don, come here!

57:45.935 --> 57:48.411
Someone must have called
the fire department.

57:48.411 --> 57:50.187
Wait, wait!

57:50.187 --> 57:52.007
We don't know who's who.

57:52.007 --> 57:53.576
It's the fire department.

57:53.576 --> 57:54.651
They're here to help us!

57:54.651 --> 57:55.722
Come on,
this is our only shot.

57:55.722 --> 57:57.211
We gotta make sure
they're legit.

57:59.439 --> 58:01.133
Jonas.

58:01.133 --> 58:03.782
Yeah, everything's all set,
just like you want, Carter.

58:03.782 --> 58:06.541
Yeah, we're right here.

58:06.541 --> 58:08.736
Don't you worry
about a thing, boss.

58:08.736 --> 58:10.554
We got it covered.

58:24.313 --> 58:26.870
Well, looks like he's here
to put the fire out.

58:29.601 --> 58:32.686
I don't see anybody.

58:32.686 --> 58:34.458
Okay, come on right, okay.

58:34.458 --> 58:36.437
Look.

58:36.437 --> 58:39.440
When I open the door, we run
as fast as we can right to him.

58:39.440 --> 58:42.325
Okay, we don't stop.

58:42.325 --> 58:43.929
Straight there, all right?

58:43.929 --> 58:44.999
Yes.

58:44.999 --> 58:46.436
We use his radio
to call for help.

58:53.813 --> 58:55.500
Go, go!

58:55.500 --> 58:57.189
Hey, hey, hey!

58:57.189 --> 58:58.586
Oh, my God, thank you so much
for coming here!

58:58.586 --> 58:59.537
They're trying to kill us!

58:59.537 --> 59:00.483
One second, one second!

59:00.483 --> 59:01.841
Listen to me.

59:01.841 --> 59:02.996
What's going on?

59:02.996 --> 59:03.942
There are four men.

59:03.942 --> 59:04.926
Yes, sir.

59:04.926 --> 59:05.961
They've killed a girl.

59:05.961 --> 59:07.075
They're playing some kind
of sick game.

59:07.075 --> 59:07.978
You need to contact the state
police now.

59:07.978 --> 59:08.927
Yes, sir.

59:08.927 --> 59:09.992
I need a weapon!

59:09.992 --> 59:10.939
All right, right around the back
there's an axe.

59:10.939 --> 59:11.892
You go grab it.

59:11.892 --> 59:12.880
I'm gonna go call it in
on the radio.

59:12.880 --> 59:13.869
You go.

59:13.869 --> 59:16.463
Honey, hurry up.

59:16.463 --> 59:17.818
Where is it?

59:21.278 --> 59:24.247
Where is it?

59:28.574 --> 59:29.885
Don!

59:41.135 --> 59:43.102
Oh, my God!

59:43.102 --> 59:44.620
Are you okay?

59:46.709 --> 59:48.480
I'm fine.

59:48.480 --> 59:50.822
Let's take this truck.

59:50.822 --> 59:54.144
Okay.

59:56.149 --> 59:57.954
Careful!

01:00:03.418 --> 01:00:06.001
Don, hurry.

01:00:08.055 --> 01:00:09.942
Oh, my God!

01:00:09.942 --> 01:00:12.814
Run!

01:00:14.082 --> 01:00:15.891
This way!

01:00:21.723 --> 01:00:22.669
Fuckers!

01:00:22.669 --> 01:00:25.371
Oh my-- oh, my God!

01:00:27.468 --> 01:00:30.868
Don!

01:00:38.192 --> 01:00:41.581
There's a window!

01:00:41.581 --> 01:00:42.638
Get out the window.

01:00:42.638 --> 01:00:43.542
There's--

01:00:43.542 --> 01:00:44.683
Listen to me.

01:00:44.683 --> 01:00:46.846
If you make it to the car,
try to get the gun.

01:00:46.846 --> 01:00:48.073
Okay?

01:00:48.073 --> 01:00:49.093
I'll be right behind you.

01:00:49.093 --> 01:00:50.066
I will hold them off.

01:00:50.066 --> 01:00:51.136
Go!

01:00:51.136 --> 01:00:52.324
I can't go
without you, Don!

01:00:52.324 --> 01:00:53.548
Listen to me,
we're gonna make it.

01:00:53.548 --> 01:00:55.138
When you see someone,

01:00:55.138 --> 01:00:57.546
you start firing
and you don't stop.

01:00:57.546 --> 01:01:00.000
Go.

01:01:12.901 --> 01:01:14.988
All right, you mother-fucker!

01:01:21.024 --> 01:01:22.437
Goddamn it!

01:01:22.437 --> 01:01:23.763
We got to go in there and kill
that son of a bitch right now.

01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:25.642
He's gonna be a problem.

01:01:25.642 --> 01:01:27.519
Not yet.

01:01:27.519 --> 01:01:28.761
What do you mean,
not yet?

01:01:28.761 --> 01:01:32.344
He killed my cousin Cody,
you son of a bitch.

01:01:32.344 --> 01:01:34.011
I said not yet.

01:01:34.011 --> 01:01:37.425
Now, Carter,
you put that pistol away.

01:01:37.425 --> 01:01:39.321
Otherwise, one of us is gonna
die today.

01:01:41.290 --> 01:01:42.879
But which one?

01:01:42.879 --> 01:01:44.169
Now, why don't you give me
a chance?

01:01:44.169 --> 01:01:45.626
I bet you I could outdraw you.

01:01:47.498 --> 01:01:49.173
Don't get all tough
on me now.

01:01:52.293 --> 01:01:55.488
I like it when you do
the gladiator thing.

01:02:03.557 --> 01:02:05.676
Why don't we just get the show
back on the road?

01:02:05.676 --> 01:02:07.752
All right?

01:02:08.994 --> 01:02:09.944
All right.

01:02:21.958 --> 01:02:26.312
Fuck!

01:02:28.645 --> 01:02:30.017
Find the gun, find the gun!

01:02:30.017 --> 01:02:31.057
There was a fucking gun.

01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:33.630
Ahh!

01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:36.574
Oh!

01:02:54.738 --> 01:02:56.004
Shit!

01:03:14.206 --> 01:03:16.577
Argh!

01:03:16.577 --> 01:03:19.084
You listen to me!

01:03:19.084 --> 01:03:22.730
Take me to my wife,
or I will fucking kill you!

01:03:39.269 --> 01:03:40.837
Easy now!

01:03:40.837 --> 01:03:45.125
You are one tough
son of a bitch.

01:03:45.125 --> 01:03:46.988
But I know you.

01:03:46.988 --> 01:03:50.676
You are not a real killer.

01:03:50.676 --> 01:03:53.608
I just work here.

01:03:53.608 --> 01:03:57.850
Where's my wife?

01:03:57.850 --> 01:04:00.819
You kill me and you ain't never
gonna find her!

01:04:00.819 --> 01:04:05.011
Just listen.

01:04:05.011 --> 01:04:06.629
Let's make a deal.

01:04:06.629 --> 01:04:10.191
I will help you and your wife
get out of here alive,

01:04:10.191 --> 01:04:14.515
but I need you to do
two things for me.

01:04:14.515 --> 01:04:17.950
One, let me walk out of here.

01:04:20.541 --> 01:04:22.828
And two?

01:04:22.828 --> 01:04:26.009
You go kill that son
of a bitch Cleveland first.

01:04:26.009 --> 01:04:29.489
You shoot him right between
the fucking eyes.

01:04:29.489 --> 01:04:31.098
Agreed?

01:04:31.098 --> 01:04:33.096
I'm listening.

01:04:35.387 --> 01:04:37.115
Okay.

01:04:37.115 --> 01:04:39.816
Right behind you,
under that table,

01:04:39.816 --> 01:04:41.972
you're gonna find a pistol.

01:04:41.972 --> 01:04:44.509
It's fully loaded,
taped in place.

01:04:44.509 --> 01:04:46.751
I'm ain't going nowhere.

01:04:57.730 --> 01:05:00.431
There.

01:05:00.431 --> 01:05:02.840
It's all good.

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:06.768
We got a deal, right?

01:05:12.765 --> 01:05:15.464
I decided to change my mind.

01:05:15.464 --> 01:05:17.288
Stand up.

01:05:25.522 --> 01:05:28.183
Stop that whimpering.

01:05:28.183 --> 01:05:32.621
We're gonna walk out to my car
and if you run away,

01:05:32.621 --> 01:05:35.236
I shoot you down like a dog.

01:05:47.322 --> 01:05:48.585
Argh!

01:06:04.931 --> 01:06:09.109
Go, go, go, go!

01:06:51.206 --> 01:06:54.886
Whoo, we got ourselves
a gun fight!

01:06:56.871 --> 01:06:58.672
Hey, ya!

01:07:04.551 --> 01:07:06.176
Yee-ha!

01:07:09.265 --> 01:07:11.068
Run little doggie, run!

01:07:11.068 --> 01:07:12.055
Come on, you son of a bitch!

01:07:24.026 --> 01:07:25.481
I hope you run better
than you shoot!

01:07:59.023 --> 01:08:00.354
Ugh!

01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:10.857
Oh!

01:08:10.857 --> 01:08:13.007
My favorite part.

01:08:25.657 --> 01:08:27.587
Ah, you son of a bitch!

01:08:33.335 --> 01:08:35.939
Put that goddamn thing down,
you son of a bitch.

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.528
Ugh!

01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:45.929
Carter!

01:09:45.929 --> 01:09:47.917
Carter.

01:09:50.243 --> 01:09:52.915
What's a matter, Cleveland?

01:09:52.915 --> 01:09:56.428
Don't want to play anymore?

01:09:56.428 --> 01:09:58.464
Help me.

01:09:58.464 --> 01:10:02.781
You know, I feel kind of
like an emperor.

01:10:02.781 --> 01:10:06.123
Should I give you the thumbs up,
or thumbs down?

01:10:08.406 --> 01:10:10.564
Goddamn, this ain't funny.

01:10:10.564 --> 01:10:12.598
Help me out.

01:10:14.438 --> 01:10:18.001
Come on.

01:10:18.001 --> 01:10:19.303
Goddamn it!

01:10:22.876 --> 01:10:24.133
And all I asked of you
is one goddamn thing,

01:10:24.133 --> 01:10:25.057
just stay organized.

01:10:25.057 --> 01:10:27.867
You just couldn't do it,
could you?

01:10:31.396 --> 01:10:33.031
These things cost.

01:10:33.031 --> 01:10:37.304
You're right about one thing.

01:10:37.304 --> 01:10:39.155
Somebody is gonna die tonight.

01:11:32.281 --> 01:11:34.333
To everything there is a season,

01:11:34.333 --> 01:11:36.469
and a time to every purpose
under the heavens.

01:11:36.469 --> 01:11:40.646
A time to be born,
and a time to die.

01:11:40.646 --> 01:11:43.132
A time to plant,

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:44.871
and a time to pluck up
that which is planted.

01:11:44.871 --> 01:11:47.793
A time to kill,

01:11:47.793 --> 01:11:49.966
and a time to heal.

01:11:49.966 --> 01:11:53.192
A time to break down,
and a time to build up.

01:11:53.192 --> 01:11:58.033
A time to weep,
and a time to laugh.

01:11:58.033 --> 01:11:59.554
A time to mourn

01:11:59.554 --> 01:12:04.258
as we say goodbye
to our dear friend, Sydney.

01:12:04.258 --> 01:12:08.400
We lament her loss yet we
rejoice in gaining the knowledge

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:11.881
that she still continues
to look down upon us.

01:12:11.881 --> 01:12:14.885
Let's make Sydney proud.

01:12:14.885 --> 01:12:17.501
Go in peace.

01:12:17.501 --> 01:12:21.420
This funeral has ended.

01:12:36.930 --> 01:12:39.241
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:12:39.241 --> 01:12:40.985
Thank you.

01:12:40.985 --> 01:12:42.160
Sydney was a friend of mine.

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:45.031
Is there anything I can do?

01:12:45.031 --> 01:12:48.035
No, thank you.

01:12:48.035 --> 01:12:49.304
I can't think of anything.

01:12:49.304 --> 01:12:50.921
I have a place for you
to stay tonight

01:12:50.921 --> 01:12:53.918
if you don't want to take
the long drive home.

01:12:53.918 --> 01:12:57.056
Thank you, sir.

01:13:16.572 --> 01:13:19.448
We do have a code, you know.

01:13:19.448 --> 01:13:20.932
Code of silence.

01:13:23.019 --> 01:13:26.721
Yeah, I heard a rumor
from a little birdie

01:13:26.721 --> 01:13:28.734
that you've been running
your mouth

01:13:28.734 --> 01:13:32.079
about our organization.

01:13:32.079 --> 01:13:34.998
Well, I didn't figure you
were gonna level with me.

01:13:34.998 --> 01:13:37.484
Can't live by the code,
then you're gonna die by it.

01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:51.075
All right,
you take it easy there.
