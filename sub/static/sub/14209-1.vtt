**

00:08.934 --> 00:12.201
* you won't admit you love me *

00:12.201 --> 00:13.867
* and so *

00:13.867 --> 00:16.567
* how am i ever *

00:16.567 --> 00:18.334
* to know *

00:18.334 --> 00:21.067
* you always tell me *

* perhaps *

00:27.633 --> 00:29.967
* perhaps *

* perhaps *

00:32.234 --> 00:34.234
( tolling )

00:40.434 --> 00:42.234
Sally: so why
a dating agency?

00:42.234 --> 00:44.734
because i'm tired
of wasting my time

00:44.734 --> 00:47.700
on people
who aren't desperate.

00:47.700 --> 00:50.434
which, thinking about it,

00:50.434 --> 00:54.167
was probably the wrong thing
to say on my video message.

00:54.167 --> 00:56.034
okay, girls, scan.

00:56.034 --> 00:57.700
he'll be holding
a newspaper.

00:57.700 --> 00:59.533
Sally: but you're
not desperate.

00:59.533 --> 01:02.834
Sally, i'm practically
in season.

01:02.834 --> 01:04.867
i swear if i walk
past a farmyard,

01:04.867 --> 01:07.167
every animal
would lift its head.

01:07.167 --> 01:09.201
is there a noise
coming from your bag?

01:09.201 --> 01:11.267
it's my phone.
it's on vibrate.

01:11.267 --> 01:13.967
but it's no substitute, is it?

01:13.967 --> 01:16.667
<i>but you're not
desperate desperate</i>

01:16.667 --> 01:18.734
like, you know, a man.

01:18.734 --> 01:21.201
last week i went out
and bought a puppy.

01:21.201 --> 01:23.567
a puppy can't be
a boyfriend substitute
forever.

01:23.567 --> 01:25.401
they grow up.

01:25.401 --> 01:26.600
i missed it.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.034
so turn the ringer
back on.

01:28.034 --> 01:30.368
i was trying to get
ahold of you
all afternoon.

01:30.368 --> 01:33.401
oh...so that was you.

01:37.034 --> 01:40.034
hello. this is jane.
thanks for calling.

01:40.034 --> 01:43.533
<i>no, really, thank you
so very, very, very much.</i>

01:43.533 --> 01:45.334
what exactly is that?

01:45.334 --> 01:47.001
pregnant one month,
and every mother i know

01:47.001 --> 01:48.134
is giving me
their old stuff.

01:48.134 --> 01:49.967
that's a breast pump,
isn't it?

01:49.967 --> 01:51.468
a breast what?

01:51.468 --> 01:52.468
don't be alarmed.

01:52.468 --> 01:54.334
it's just
for expressing milk.

01:54.334 --> 01:56.301
no.
is it?

01:56.301 --> 01:59.067
<i>i so need a boyfriend.</i>

02:00.134 --> 02:04.101
anyway, um, uh, Steve.

02:05.867 --> 02:08.267
there's a guy with flowers.
is that him?

02:08.267 --> 02:11.201
he definitely said
newspaper.

02:11.201 --> 02:12.967
good. i don't like
a guy with flowers.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.967
it means he's done
something he shouldn't.

02:14.967 --> 02:17.267
the bigger the bouquet,
the younger she was.

02:17.267 --> 02:19.134
Sally, look.
by the door.

02:19.134 --> 02:20.633
<i>it's the guardian.</i>

02:20.633 --> 02:23.134
it's gotta be him.
what do you think?

02:23.134 --> 02:24.667
he's behind a newspaper.

02:24.667 --> 02:26.134
but first impressions.

02:26.134 --> 02:29.001
i think he's shy,

02:29.001 --> 02:34.167
and i think there's
a rail strike on the 14th.

02:34.167 --> 02:36.434
look,
want a quick touch-up?

02:36.434 --> 02:38.368
oh, good idea.

02:38.368 --> 02:40.734
i prefer it
when firemen go on strike.

02:40.734 --> 02:42.301
well, that's the cutest.

02:42.301 --> 02:44.167
you've got
a whole protest march

02:44.167 --> 02:45.900
full of lovely little firemen,

02:45.900 --> 02:48.101
and you can
just pick one off.

02:48.101 --> 02:50.234
how romantic.

02:50.234 --> 02:54.201
it's like a buffet...
or a herd of gazelles.

02:55.667 --> 02:57.034
little fireman-wise,

02:57.034 --> 02:59.633
i doubt that comparison's
ever come up before.

03:02.334 --> 03:03.468
what's wrong?
( gasps )

03:03.468 --> 03:06.234
he's my gynecologist!

03:06.234 --> 03:08.267
oh, my god,
are you sure?

03:08.267 --> 03:09.700
yeah, i just saw
his face.

03:09.700 --> 03:13.201
he looked straight at me,
and my ankles went together.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.167
patrick: Sally.

03:16.167 --> 03:18.201
i can't let him
see me again.

03:18.201 --> 03:19.767
can i borrow that mirror?

03:19.767 --> 03:22.667
oh...patrick.

03:24.401 --> 03:25.633
hi.

03:25.633 --> 03:27.201
hi.

03:27.201 --> 03:29.667
well, it's quite the day
for ankles, isn't it?

03:31.967 --> 03:33.468
oh, god!

03:39.134 --> 03:40.567
listen, about tonight...

03:40.567 --> 03:42.067
( gasping )
you know what?

03:42.067 --> 03:43.967
i'm gonna wear
that lace-up thing.

03:43.967 --> 03:46.167
isn't it...damaged?

03:47.368 --> 03:50.234
could be worse.
let's try.

03:50.234 --> 03:51.267
we need to talk.

03:51.267 --> 03:53.001
let me get my drink.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.600
oh, for christ's sake!

03:55.600 --> 03:57.101
are you all right?

03:57.101 --> 03:59.834
just discussing
future relationship issues.

03:59.834 --> 04:01.967
we never worry
about things like that.

04:01.967 --> 04:04.301
i've got a lace-up.

04:04.301 --> 04:06.301
slightly damaged.

04:10.434 --> 04:12.034
( sighs ) Sally...

04:12.034 --> 04:17.500
you know how sometimes people
have to go away for a while

04:17.500 --> 04:21.166
and sometimes they forget
to tell other people--

04:21.166 --> 04:25.301
possibly women, possibly
women they're involved with--

04:25.301 --> 04:28.267
they're gonna be
in portugal for a week
until the very last minute?

04:28.267 --> 04:30.633
no.

04:30.633 --> 04:32.067
okay.

04:32.067 --> 04:34.201
i've got something
to tell you...

04:34.201 --> 04:36.734
and it's gonna seem
very last-minute.

04:36.734 --> 04:37.934
yeah?

04:37.934 --> 04:39.267
about the upcoming week.

04:39.267 --> 04:41.368
okay.

04:41.368 --> 04:43.700
you're really not
paying attention, are you?

04:43.700 --> 04:45.700
your top button's undone.
i can smell your neck.

04:45.700 --> 04:46.767
Sally.

04:46.767 --> 04:48.867
i'm going away.

04:48.867 --> 04:49.934
away?

04:49.934 --> 04:51.334
away, yes.

04:51.334 --> 04:52.567
you're going away?

04:52.567 --> 04:54.700
i appreciate i should've
mentioned this earlier...

04:54.700 --> 04:56.434
why? when are you going?

04:56.434 --> 04:58.700
well, in four minutes.

04:58.700 --> 05:00.734
four minutes?!

05:00.734 --> 05:02.967
taxi's outside.
four minutes--yeah.

05:02.967 --> 05:04.334
four minutes?!

05:04.334 --> 05:07.334
just wanted to
let you know in advance.

05:07.334 --> 05:09.167
four minutes
is not in advance!

05:09.167 --> 05:11.500
four minutes
is practically afterwards!

05:11.500 --> 05:12.767
well, it's on the cusp.

05:12.767 --> 05:16.034
( gasping )

05:16.034 --> 05:17.700
patrick!

05:17.700 --> 05:19.767
h-how is this possible?

05:19.767 --> 05:23.334
why am i finding out about this
four minutes before it happens?

05:23.334 --> 05:25.167
i was putting off
telling you--

05:25.167 --> 05:26.368
and?

05:26.368 --> 05:28.633
i succeeded.

05:31.967 --> 05:33.633
right.

05:33.633 --> 05:36.267
well, i have a great deal
to say to you,

05:36.267 --> 05:37.834
but there are
time constraints,

05:37.834 --> 05:39.800
so i'll summarize
the first ten pages.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.667
okay. good idea.

05:41.667 --> 05:43.234
oh!

05:43.234 --> 05:45.101
okay, got the gist there.

05:45.101 --> 05:47.234
( sighs )

05:47.234 --> 05:49.468
simple questions first.

05:49.468 --> 05:52.001
where are you going and why?

05:52.001 --> 05:54.767
portugal. golfing trip.
every year, a few of my friend--

05:54.767 --> 05:56.500
okay. bored now.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.734
i take it you're about
to look me in the eye

05:58.734 --> 06:00.167
and promise you'll phone.

06:00.167 --> 06:02.834
why? i'm not dumping you.

06:05.134 --> 06:07.167
patrick...

06:07.167 --> 06:10.134
women don't automatically
assume they're being dumped

06:10.134 --> 06:12.700
just because a man
promises to phone.

06:12.700 --> 06:15.434
that's the beauty of it.

06:20.468 --> 06:22.434
okay.

06:22.434 --> 06:27.034
this is the first problem
we've encountered
in our relationship,

06:27.034 --> 06:29.267
and here's how
we're gonna deal with it.

06:29.267 --> 06:30.533
okay.

06:30.533 --> 06:31.967
you're not going.

06:33.533 --> 06:35.167
( chuckling ) i-i'm sorry?

06:35.167 --> 06:36.434
i'm disallowing it.

06:36.434 --> 06:37.700
you're disallowing it?

06:37.700 --> 06:39.301
yup, sorry.
it's been disallowed now.

06:39.301 --> 06:40.600
there's nothing i can do.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.401
but--what--i didn't know
there'd be disallowing.

06:43.401 --> 06:45.067
it's a relationship.

06:45.067 --> 06:47.301
we have to discuss
things now, patrick.

06:47.301 --> 06:50.533
there is a time
for just taking off
and enjoying yourself,

06:50.533 --> 06:51.834
and that time is over.

06:53.301 --> 06:56.334
now we have to have huge,
enormous discussions first,

06:56.334 --> 06:58.134
with crying.

07:00.334 --> 07:02.034
but i've said i'll go.

07:02.034 --> 07:05.267
patrick, our relationship
is at a very critical stage.

07:05.267 --> 07:08.401
we're only three weeks in,
and whilst we have been...

07:10.434 --> 07:12.167
...intimate,

07:12.167 --> 07:17.201
whilst we have had many
enjoyable intimate moments...

07:17.201 --> 07:19.401
including
my number one favorite.

07:19.401 --> 07:24.867
but not the actual act
of...consummation.

07:24.867 --> 07:27.334
it happened once,
but you were caught
by surprise.

07:28.368 --> 07:30.533
patrick...

07:30.533 --> 07:32.734
oh! you mean
we haven't done the...

07:32.734 --> 07:34.267
yes.

07:34.267 --> 07:36.401
the excellent part.

07:36.401 --> 07:37.734
i was holding back.

07:37.734 --> 07:39.767
i thought we might
end up sleeping together,

07:39.767 --> 07:41.401
and the next day
you'd leave the country.

07:41.401 --> 07:43.533
you pretty much missed
the window on that one.

07:47.633 --> 07:49.600
so...

07:51.234 --> 07:54.368
it's golf...

07:54.368 --> 07:59.101
or the excellent part
tonight...with me.

08:00.533 --> 08:03.934
( sighs ) but the golf!
it's...unhh!

08:03.934 --> 08:07.368
it's a long-standing
arrangement.

08:07.368 --> 08:10.368
it's all right for you,
you've only just
heard about it.

08:12.434 --> 08:14.201
( sighs ) look,
i'm really sorry.

08:14.201 --> 08:16.201
patrick.

08:16.201 --> 08:18.267
obviously,
i will phone you, and...

08:18.267 --> 08:21.034
no, you see, that just sounds
like i'm dumping you.

08:21.034 --> 08:24.034
yeah. yeah, it does.

08:29.101 --> 08:30.434
( sighs ) i've gotta go.

08:30.434 --> 08:32.001
fine. whatever.

08:40.234 --> 08:41.866
( man groans )

08:41.866 --> 08:43.600
<i>get the gist that time?!</i>

08:44.800 --> 08:46.633
Sally, i've changed my mind.

08:46.633 --> 08:48.600
sod the golf,
i'll go for the sex.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.201
oh, my god!

08:51.234 --> 08:53.500
what, didn't you like them?

08:53.500 --> 08:55.134
i'm sorry!

08:55.134 --> 08:56.533
that's okay.
patrick: Sally!

08:56.533 --> 08:59.600
it's a relationship.
people are bound to get hurt.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.234
Sally, the excellent part. now!

09:02.234 --> 09:04.067
what changed your mind?

09:04.067 --> 09:07.934
i don't know.
maybe i just got deep.

09:09.000 --> 09:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:17.667 --> 09:20.667
( tolling )

09:24.767 --> 09:26.533
Sally: so why
a dating agency?

09:26.533 --> 09:29.301
because i'm tired
of wasting my time

09:29.301 --> 09:32.067
on people
who aren't desperate,

09:32.067 --> 09:33.468
which, thinking about it,

09:33.468 --> 09:37.134
was probably the wrong thing
to say on my video message.

09:37.134 --> 09:39.500
okay, girls, scan.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.368
he'll be holding
a newspaper.

09:42.468 --> 09:45.468
jeff, calm down.

09:45.468 --> 09:47.834
jeff, just listen, okay?

09:47.834 --> 09:49.401
three things.

09:49.401 --> 09:53.134
one, you should not be using
your mobile phone on a plane.

09:53.134 --> 09:58.468
two, the name of the island
is pronounced les-boss.

10:02.500 --> 10:05.800
yeah, well, that was fairly
optimistic of you, wasn't it?

10:08.267 --> 10:12.434
three, the behavior
of breast implants at altitude

10:12.434 --> 10:15.533
isn't a subject i can
claim great knowledge of.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.201
yeah, no, i'm fairly sure

10:17.201 --> 10:20.101
you can't raise it
with a complete stranger.

10:20.101 --> 10:23.267
no, whatever danger
you think she's in.

10:23.267 --> 10:27.600
no, jeff, not even with
the people in shrapnel range.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.001
okay, look,
i'm gonna hang up now.

10:30.001 --> 10:31.600
because i don't
want to endanger

10:31.600 --> 10:33.334
a planeload
of innocent passengers

10:33.334 --> 10:34.734
by prolonging a conversation

10:34.734 --> 10:37.267
about the hazards
of breast inflation.

10:37.267 --> 10:39.167
sorry i'm late.

10:39.167 --> 10:41.001
what's that?

10:41.001 --> 10:42.867
it's, um, a breast pump.

10:44.234 --> 10:45.967
i'm sorry?

10:45.967 --> 10:48.934
you're not gonna do
that nervous swallowing thing,
are you? or make a face?

10:48.934 --> 10:51.201
no, no, not at all.

10:51.201 --> 10:55.201
i'm a bit surprised,
but hey, great!

10:55.201 --> 10:58.600
it's gonna come in handy
if i'm planning
on keeping my job.

10:58.600 --> 11:01.034
<i>and it's got to be safer
than implants.</i>

11:03.867 --> 11:06.500
it's for extracting milk.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.633
for the baby.

11:07.633 --> 11:10.034
that you and i
are going to have.

11:10.034 --> 11:11.934
oh.

11:13.134 --> 11:14.900
there it goes,
the swallowing.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.101
the what?

11:16.101 --> 11:18.001
the nervous swallowing.
the glugging!

11:18.001 --> 11:19.434
every time
we discuss this baby.

11:19.434 --> 11:20.934
it's like
there's a blocked sink

11:20.934 --> 11:23.567
if i mention any part
of the actual physical process.

11:23.567 --> 11:24.767
not true!

11:24.767 --> 11:26.234
like when i said
"pelvic floor".

11:26.234 --> 11:27.667
i was fine with that!

11:27.667 --> 11:30.967
i was fine with the floor.

11:30.967 --> 11:33.834
i got us some drinks.
they're over there.

11:35.567 --> 11:38.067
vaginal discharge!

11:40.900 --> 11:44.633
glug glug glug
and down the plughole.

11:44.633 --> 11:45.934
hello.

11:45.934 --> 11:48.533
is that yours?

11:48.533 --> 11:50.700
uh, yes.
yes, it is.

11:50.700 --> 11:53.234
is it specially adapted
for really tiny puppies?

11:55.533 --> 11:56.900
piss off!

12:00.101 --> 12:03.334
what is suddenly the big deal
about the size of my breasts?

12:03.334 --> 12:05.234
<i>( groans ) where did this
come from?</i>

12:05.234 --> 12:07.468
your breasts are no big deal.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.334
no, i-i mean--

12:11.334 --> 12:13.368
well, you know
what they say--

12:13.368 --> 12:16.001
size is not important.

12:16.001 --> 12:17.468
isn't that what i say?

12:17.468 --> 12:20.401
over and over again
practically every night?

12:20.401 --> 12:23.267
actually,
you've never said that.

12:23.267 --> 12:25.667
not out loud.

12:25.667 --> 12:27.201
now you're just being cruel!

12:27.201 --> 12:28.900
you can't say that to a man!

12:28.900 --> 12:30.834
oh, but i have to be
strategically inflated?

12:30.834 --> 12:32.900
but a man's equipment...

12:32.900 --> 12:34.368
i mean, it's like--

12:34.368 --> 12:37.201
it's like a buffet
or a herd of gazelles.

12:39.600 --> 12:40.934
little fireman-wise,

12:40.934 --> 12:43.734
i don't think that comparison's
ever come up before.

12:49.301 --> 12:51.800
you know
what i don't get?
what?

12:51.800 --> 12:54.434
i'm the one who gives birth.
you get that, right?

12:54.434 --> 12:55.667
yes.

12:55.667 --> 12:57.834
so why are you
the one who's afraid?

12:57.834 --> 12:59.633
well, it's all right
for you

12:59.633 --> 13:01.533
when you get to stay
at the top end,

13:01.533 --> 13:05.301
when you don't see
the actual...emission.

13:06.834 --> 13:08.967
emission?
yes!

13:08.967 --> 13:11.368
actually, speaking
of that stuff--

13:11.368 --> 13:12.500
what stuff?

13:12.500 --> 13:13.700
afterwards.

13:13.700 --> 13:14.934
yeah.

13:14.934 --> 13:16.034
a-after you've...

13:16.034 --> 13:18.900
emitted?
emitted, yes.

13:18.900 --> 13:23.134
how does it affect...things?

13:23.134 --> 13:25.600
Susan, can i borrow
a mirror?

13:25.600 --> 13:27.134
why?

13:27.134 --> 13:28.734
i need to check something.

13:28.734 --> 13:32.334
i think my gynecologist's done
something extremely naughty.

13:36.667 --> 13:38.101
do you want to
elaborate on that?

13:38.101 --> 13:40.867
he's here!
he's my date!

13:40.867 --> 13:42.201
oh! oh, i see.

13:42.201 --> 13:46.034
Susan, if i need a rescue,
can i signal?

13:46.034 --> 13:47.401
sure.

13:49.368 --> 13:51.101
uh...you were saying?

13:51.101 --> 13:52.368
i'm sorry?

13:52.368 --> 13:54.067
i believe i just emitted.

13:54.067 --> 13:57.533
yeah, well, uh,
after that, after the...

13:57.533 --> 14:01.401
wh--how long, as it were,

14:01.401 --> 14:02.900
before everything's...

14:02.900 --> 14:05.401
back?

14:05.401 --> 14:06.401
back?
to--

14:06.401 --> 14:08.368
to what?
--gether?

14:08.368 --> 14:09.934
oh, for christ's sake!

14:09.934 --> 14:12.101
are you all right?

14:12.101 --> 14:14.600
just discussing
future relationship issues.

14:14.600 --> 14:17.267
we never worry
about things like that.

14:17.267 --> 14:18.633
i've got a lace-up.

14:19.967 --> 14:22.468
slightly damaged.

14:25.201 --> 14:27.600
what i'm saying is

14:27.600 --> 14:30.267
after the john hurt part...

14:30.267 --> 14:32.334
no, no, no.
Steve!

14:32.334 --> 14:35.434
can we just clear this up
once and for all?

14:35.434 --> 14:39.700
<i>alien is not really
about parenthood.</i>

14:39.700 --> 14:40.900
well...

14:40.900 --> 14:42.001
just this once,

14:42.001 --> 14:43.934
could we manage
to discuss childbirth

14:43.934 --> 14:45.434
without involving john hurt?

14:45.434 --> 14:48.834
Susan!
no man can do that!

14:48.834 --> 14:51.934
okay.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.600
i mean, imagine
what it's like for john hurt.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.201
oh, please, can we not?!

14:56.201 --> 14:58.401
if he was visiting
a maternity ward,

14:58.401 --> 15:01.067
all the guys in obstetrics
would be crowding around,

15:01.067 --> 15:03.101
going "hey, it's da man."

15:03.101 --> 15:06.067
"john, you're the guy
that got me into this racket."

15:06.067 --> 15:08.468
anyway, after
the john hurt part...

15:08.468 --> 15:13.967
well...you remember
those photographs.

15:13.967 --> 15:16.567
i remember those
photographs of childbirth,

15:16.567 --> 15:17.934
the miracle of life.

15:17.934 --> 15:19.934
yeah, for you
"the miracle of life."

15:19.934 --> 15:22.067
for me and every other
man in the world,

15:22.067 --> 15:23.867
horror porn!

15:23.867 --> 15:25.201
oh, god!

15:27.401 --> 15:31.700
i have seen a lot
of photographs
of naked women in my time,

15:31.700 --> 15:34.267
and there are some places

15:34.267 --> 15:37.434
you don't expect to see a face.

15:40.001 --> 15:41.267
so is that the problem?

15:41.267 --> 15:42.867
what problem?

15:42.867 --> 15:45.700
i used to be
your sexy girlfriend,
now i'm john hurt.

15:46.900 --> 15:49.267
Susan, i am gonna need help.

15:49.267 --> 15:50.667
how's the gynecologist?

15:50.667 --> 15:52.334
he's fine, he's lovely,

15:52.334 --> 15:53.900
but this date
isn't gonna work out.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.301
is the job a problem?

15:55.301 --> 15:56.834
of course it's a problem!

15:56.834 --> 15:58.468
well, rescue me, Susan!

15:58.468 --> 16:00.201
okay. what do you
want me to do?

16:00.201 --> 16:03.134
just get me out of it
so it doesn't seem
like my fault,

16:03.134 --> 16:06.034
but also it doesn't seem
like his fault.

16:06.034 --> 16:08.167
it could be Steve's fault.
he's good for that.

16:09.434 --> 16:10.700
hi.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.700
Steve, Susan,

16:12.700 --> 16:14.234
this is oliver.

16:14.234 --> 16:17.334
i'm just gonna freshen up.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.567
sorry about earlier.

16:20.567 --> 16:23.101
it was a misunderstanding,
obviously.

16:23.101 --> 16:25.834
yes. yes, obviously.

16:25.834 --> 16:28.468
so, sorry to bring this up,
but i'm surprised

16:28.468 --> 16:31.201
you think it's acceptable
to be on a date with jane.

16:31.201 --> 16:33.468
so jane must've mentioned
what i do for a living.

16:33.468 --> 16:35.034
yes, yes, she did.

16:35.034 --> 16:37.767
i mean, it must be a bit weird
being on a date with her.

16:37.767 --> 16:40.667
a bit like reading a book
when you've peeked at the end.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.201
Steve!

16:43.567 --> 16:44.633
sorry.

16:46.734 --> 16:49.533
okay, oliver,
here's a question for you.

16:49.533 --> 16:52.101
kind of in your area.

16:53.967 --> 16:56.267
what does john hurt
mean to you?

16:56.267 --> 16:57.368
oh, for god's sake!

16:57.368 --> 16:58.434
john hurt?

16:58.434 --> 16:59.900
professionally, i mean.

16:59.900 --> 17:02.267
i'm thinking specifically
of, you know...

17:02.267 --> 17:03.834
the john hurt moment.

17:03.834 --> 17:06.567
oh, you mean--
oh, yeah.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.468
( both screeching )

17:09.934 --> 17:11.633
well, it's seminal,
isn't it?

17:11.633 --> 17:13.532
i mean, john hurt,
he's da man!

17:13.532 --> 17:14.532
exactly!

17:14.532 --> 17:15.967
<i>that moment in alien,</i>

17:15.967 --> 17:19.101
that's what got me
into this business
in the first place.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.001
really.

17:24.201 --> 17:26.367
so why are you asking
about john hurt?

17:26.367 --> 17:27.733
maybe i should explain.

17:27.733 --> 17:29.900
i'm in the john hurt way
at the moment.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.600
( screeches )

17:34.734 --> 17:36.134
r-right.

17:36.134 --> 17:38.667
she means she's incubating
an alien life form

17:38.667 --> 17:41.900
and one day
it's gonna climb out
and destroy our world.

17:41.900 --> 17:44.567
i think he's mostly worried
about the damage.

17:44.567 --> 17:46.301
maybe i should come
and see you.

17:46.301 --> 17:48.767
uh, sure. anytime.

17:48.767 --> 17:50.967
as long as you don't
have those stirrups.

17:50.967 --> 17:54.201
exposing myself
is bad enough,
i don't need the draft.

17:55.334 --> 17:56.633
okay. ready.

17:56.633 --> 17:57.700
right, yeah.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.600
yeah. ready!

17:59.600 --> 18:00.633
anytime.

18:00.633 --> 18:02.134
bye-bye.

18:05.101 --> 18:08.567
i'm quite excited
about that little alien

18:08.567 --> 18:10.468
who's about to
take over our world.

18:10.468 --> 18:12.301
hey, so am i.

18:12.301 --> 18:14.767
i don't think you're
excited about me anymore.

18:14.767 --> 18:17.767
time was i could've fixed that
with one decent snog.

18:17.767 --> 18:19.267
think those days are gone?

18:19.267 --> 18:21.900
of course i don't.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.201
don't you?

18:24.767 --> 18:27.234
( cell phone rings )

18:27.234 --> 18:28.434
hello?

18:28.434 --> 18:31.967
( sighs ) jeff.
no, this is not a good moment.

18:31.967 --> 18:37.301
look, there is no such thing
as critical breast mass.

18:37.301 --> 18:39.600
no, this is not
the right moment, okay?

18:39.600 --> 18:42.900
stuff is going on.
big stuff, important stuff.

18:42.900 --> 18:47.001
( punching sound)
Sally: it's a relationship.
people are bound to get hurt!

18:55.267 --> 18:58.267
( tolling )

19:01.234 --> 19:02.967
so why a dating agency?

19:02.967 --> 19:05.368
because i'm tired
of wasting my time

19:05.368 --> 19:07.234
on people
who aren't desperate.

19:07.234 --> 19:09.800
<i>( thinking ) god,
all i wanted to say was</i>

19:09.800 --> 19:11.967
<i>if it's at all possible,</i>

19:11.967 --> 19:15.468
<i>if it doesn't interfere
in the grand scheme
of the universe,</i>

19:15.468 --> 19:18.834
<i>could i have sex
with a lady tonight?</i>

19:18.834 --> 19:21.500
<i>she doesn't
have to be gorgeous,</i>

19:21.500 --> 19:23.934
<i>as long as she's,
you know, feasible.</i>

19:23.934 --> 19:25.368
<i>with detectable ankles.</i>

19:25.368 --> 19:27.500
<i>i don't like those straight
up and down ankles</i>

19:27.500 --> 19:29.134
<i>that have a hint of furniture.</i>

19:29.134 --> 19:31.234
( phone ringing )

19:31.234 --> 19:34.500
<i>oh, please make it
one of those ones.</i>

19:34.500 --> 19:37.234
<i>jane's voicemail: hello,
and thanks for calling.</i>

19:37.234 --> 19:41.533
<i>no, really, thank you
so very, very, very much.</i>

19:42.934 --> 19:45.401
<i>here's someone else
who wants to say hello.</i>

19:45.401 --> 19:48.934
<i>( dog yelping )</i>

19:52.234 --> 19:55.667
<i>that was my brand new
tiny little puppy Steve.</i>

19:55.667 --> 19:58.734
<i>okay, leave a message.
( beep )</i>

19:58.734 --> 20:01.101
oh! sorry.

20:01.101 --> 20:02.767
shit.

20:02.767 --> 20:03.900
sorry.

20:03.900 --> 20:06.834
b-bit of visual
confusion there.

20:06.834 --> 20:08.633
this is oliver morris.

20:08.633 --> 20:11.633
i believe we're meeting
for a date thing this evening.

20:11.633 --> 20:13.800
but obviously,
you won't get this message

20:13.800 --> 20:15.834
till you get home
after the date thing,

20:15.834 --> 20:18.500
so i'm probably there
with you anyway.

20:18.500 --> 20:22.368
no! sorry! christ!

20:22.368 --> 20:25.334
my god, listen to me.
as if!

20:25.334 --> 20:27.401
oliver morris--woman killer.

20:27.401 --> 20:29.267
<i>lady killer.</i>

20:29.267 --> 20:30.633
not any kind of a killer.

20:30.633 --> 20:34.301
i'm against killing expect,
you know, self defense.

20:34.301 --> 20:37.434
and wasps.
i'm against wasps!

20:37.434 --> 20:40.234
kill wasps, not women,
for goodness' sake.

20:40.234 --> 20:42.167
anyway, thanks for listening.

20:46.267 --> 20:48.468
<i>( thinking )
wow, she's gorgeous, though.</i>

20:48.468 --> 20:51.401
<i>different color hair
from the video.</i>

20:51.401 --> 20:55.167
<i>okay. all she can say is no.</i>

20:55.167 --> 20:58.334
<i>what's a no? it's like
an honorable discharge.</i>

20:58.334 --> 21:00.334
<i>i can take
an honorable discharge.</i>

21:00.334 --> 21:02.633
<i>i can take
a dishonorable discharge.</i>

21:02.633 --> 21:05.468
vaginal discharge!

and down the plughole.

21:09.934 --> 21:11.533
hello.

21:11.533 --> 21:12.867
is that yours?

21:12.867 --> 21:15.900
yes, uh, yes.

21:15.900 --> 21:18.734
is it specially adapted
for really tiny puppies?

21:19.867 --> 21:21.167
piss off!

all women do not hate me.</i>

21:25.368 --> 21:27.600
<i>all women do not hate me.</i>

21:27.600 --> 21:29.167
<i>all women do not hate me.</i>

21:29.167 --> 21:30.800
mate, could you
do me a favor?

21:30.800 --> 21:32.633
when i give you the signal,
could you come over

21:32.633 --> 21:34.800
and give this bunch of flowers
to that girl over there?

21:34.800 --> 21:35.834
well--
thanks.

21:43.734 --> 21:47.001
( laughs loudly )

21:47.001 --> 21:50.301
god, this place, eh?

21:50.301 --> 21:51.967
bloody hell.

21:51.967 --> 21:53.700
what about it?

21:53.700 --> 21:55.633
still here.

21:55.633 --> 21:57.101
what?

21:57.101 --> 21:58.700
it's still here.

21:58.700 --> 22:00.368
what do you mean?

22:00.368 --> 22:05.533
well, it used to be here,
and-and it still is.

22:05.533 --> 22:07.201
okay.

22:07.201 --> 22:09.201
maybe i'll catch
you guys later.

22:09.201 --> 22:11.201
absolutely
definitely not.

22:11.201 --> 22:12.834
okay.

22:14.134 --> 22:16.267
oh! sorry.

22:16.267 --> 22:18.301
um, excuse me?

22:18.301 --> 22:19.800
yes?

22:19.800 --> 22:21.500
it's you, isn't it?

22:21.500 --> 22:23.167
from the video message.

22:23.167 --> 22:24.767
oh!

22:24.767 --> 22:27.767
oh! are you...?

22:27.767 --> 22:28.800
oliver morris.

22:28.800 --> 22:29.800
what's-his-name!

22:29.800 --> 22:31.267
yeah.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.533
oh, i thought you were
someone else.

22:36.633 --> 22:38.167
jane: oh.

22:38.167 --> 22:39.967
he doesn't recognize me.

22:39.967 --> 22:43.001
listen, i'm gonna have to break
eye contact with that man,

22:43.001 --> 22:46.667
or i'm gonna find myself
in the middle of a slightly
unfortunate mime.

22:46.667 --> 22:47.834
shall we sit down?

22:47.834 --> 22:49.368
sure. yeah.

22:55.967 --> 22:58.500
so, anyway, i thought
your video message

22:58.500 --> 23:00.567
was really great,
by the way.

23:00.567 --> 23:02.134
well, thank you, oliver.

23:02.134 --> 23:04.633
you know,
for a minute there,

23:04.633 --> 23:07.734
i thought i was having a date
with my gynecologist.

23:07.734 --> 23:11.067
christ, i'm sorry.
it's just such a short skirt.

23:16.001 --> 23:19.700
so, tell me, oliver,
what do you do
when you're not...

23:19.700 --> 23:21.067
looking up people's skirts?

23:21.067 --> 23:23.134
out having fun?

23:23.134 --> 23:26.867
well, i run a sort
of specialist bookshop.

23:28.667 --> 23:30.500
"hellmouths"?

23:30.500 --> 23:33.267
yeah, we cover fantasy,
science fiction, horror,

23:33.267 --> 23:34.667
you know the kind of thing.

23:34.667 --> 23:37.700
a lot of film and television
tie-in material.

23:37.700 --> 23:40.800
really, anything
that's considered
an alternative to...

23:40.800 --> 23:43.401
girlfriends.

23:43.401 --> 23:45.134
the mainstream.

23:45.134 --> 23:49.633
well, anyway,
at least you're not
a gynecologist.

23:49.633 --> 23:51.734
well, i tried to get
into gynecology,

23:51.734 --> 23:53.633
but i never got
the breaks.

23:53.633 --> 23:54.900
oh. did you?

23:54.900 --> 23:57.834
no, i just mean
it's always been

23:57.834 --> 24:01.468
an interest of mine,
obviously.

24:01.468 --> 24:03.101
what do you mean,
interest?

24:03.101 --> 24:05.134
do you study it?

24:05.134 --> 24:07.934
well, in a sense,
but it's strictly,

24:07.934 --> 24:11.134
you know,
night school.

24:11.134 --> 24:13.567
listen, maybe i can help you.

24:13.567 --> 24:15.067
come and meet dr. reynolds.

24:15.067 --> 24:16.267
no, no, i'm just--

24:16.267 --> 24:18.934
he's my gynecologist.
contacts are everything.

24:18.934 --> 24:21.234
dr. reynolds.

24:21.234 --> 24:24.034
dr. reynolds, it's me.
jane.

24:24.034 --> 24:26.001
crazy wacky jane.

24:26.001 --> 24:27.934
i'm sorry,
are you one of my patients?

24:27.934 --> 24:30.234
you see?
now you remember.

24:30.234 --> 24:32.567
i'm sorry, i'm very bad
at recognizing people
out of context.

24:32.567 --> 24:34.767
you must be very good
on faces.

24:34.767 --> 24:36.867
well, you tell me.

24:41.134 --> 24:44.034
( snorts ) anyway,
this is oliver.

24:44.034 --> 24:46.067
he's training to be
a gynecologist.

24:46.067 --> 24:48.567
he's taking evening classes.
aren't you, oliver?

24:48.567 --> 24:49.867
evening classes?

24:49.867 --> 24:52.767
i thought maybe you could
give him some advice.

24:52.767 --> 24:54.767
excuse me, boys.

24:54.767 --> 24:57.201
i'm sorry.
evening classes?

24:57.201 --> 24:59.434
well, it's not so much
an evening class,

24:59.434 --> 25:02.900
more of a weekly
slide show.

25:02.900 --> 25:04.067
slide show.

25:04.067 --> 25:07.067
you know what?
i'll see you around.

25:08.934 --> 25:10.533
hi.

25:10.533 --> 25:13.567
Steve, Susan,
this is oliver.

25:13.567 --> 25:16.767
i'm just gonna
freshen up.

25:18.101 --> 25:20.201
sorry about earlier.

25:20.201 --> 25:21.934
misunderstanding, obviously.

25:21.934 --> 25:24.134
yes, obviously.

25:25.567 --> 25:28.334
sorry to bring this up,
but i'm surprised you think

25:28.334 --> 25:30.301
it's acceptable to be out
on a date with jane.

25:30.301 --> 25:32.633
so jane must've mentioned
what i do for a living.

25:32.633 --> 25:33.867
yes, yes, she did.

25:33.867 --> 25:36.101
here's a question for you.

25:36.101 --> 25:38.167
it's kind of in your area.

25:38.167 --> 25:41.368
what does john hurt
mean to you?

25:41.368 --> 25:43.533
oh, you mean--
oh, yeah.

25:43.533 --> 25:45.834
( both screeching )

25:45.834 --> 25:47.468
well, it's seminal,
isn't it?

25:47.468 --> 25:48.800
john hurt,
he's the man!

25:48.800 --> 25:50.368
exactly!

25:50.368 --> 25:52.267
<i>that moment in alien,
that's what got me</i>

25:52.267 --> 25:53.967
into this business
in the first place.

25:53.967 --> 25:56.001
really.

25:56.001 --> 25:58.134
so why are you asking
about john hurt?

25:58.134 --> 25:59.334
maybe i should explain.

25:59.334 --> 26:01.334
i'm in the john hurt way
at the moment.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.201
( screeches )

26:05.201 --> 26:06.900
right.

26:06.900 --> 26:09.301
she means she's incubating
an alien life form

26:09.301 --> 26:11.667
and one day
it's gonna climb out
and destroy our world.

26:11.667 --> 26:13.734
i think he's mostly worried
about the damage.

26:13.734 --> 26:15.533
maybe i should come
and see you.

26:15.533 --> 26:18.934
uh, sure.
anytime.

26:18.934 --> 26:20.900
as long as you don't have
those stirrups.

26:20.900 --> 26:23.533
exposing myself is bad enough,
i don't need the draft.

26:26.434 --> 26:28.734
jane: okay, ready.

26:28.734 --> 26:30.134
right, yeah.

26:30.134 --> 26:32.468
ready! anytime.

26:32.468 --> 26:36.101
bye-bye!

26:36.101 --> 26:39.500
are your friends okay?
they seem a little stressed.

26:39.500 --> 26:44.334
you see, Susan's got
a little visitor
living in her tummy.

26:44.334 --> 26:46.001
and she's okay with that?

26:46.001 --> 26:48.368
it's what all women want,
really, isn't it?

26:48.368 --> 26:49.700
i've got a puppy!

26:56.934 --> 26:58.667
excuse me, oliver.

26:58.667 --> 26:59.934
Susan.

26:59.934 --> 27:00.967
is there a problem?

27:00.967 --> 27:03.567
didn't you say "rescue me"?

27:20.800 --> 27:22.500
easy come, easy go.

27:24.500 --> 27:27.533
oh, what the hell.
how much worse can this get?

27:31.900 --> 27:34.134
( punching sound )

27:37.101 --> 27:39.734
it's a relationship.
people are bound to get hurt.

27:39.734 --> 27:42.167
Sally, the excellent part.
now!

27:42.167 --> 27:43.434
what changed your mind?

27:43.434 --> 27:46.134
i don't know.
maybe i just got deep.

27:53.234 --> 27:54.533
( sighs )

27:54.533 --> 27:57.267
consider yourself rescued.

27:57.267 --> 27:58.934
are you all right?

28:00.034 --> 28:01.667
fine.

28:01.667 --> 28:04.101
it's just my ankles.

28:09.900 --> 28:13.167
so, can i go back
to being the sexy one now?

28:13.167 --> 28:17.067
john hurt has left
the building.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.633
good.

28:21.867 --> 28:24.900
i told you
i could solve everything
with just one snog.

28:24.900 --> 28:26.434
<i>jeff: Steve?</i>

28:26.434 --> 28:27.767
<i>Steve?</i>

28:27.767 --> 28:31.034
oh, jeffrey.

28:33.001 --> 28:35.401
did you ever pick
the wrong week to leave.

28:39.468 --> 28:42.301
* if you can't
make your mind up *

28:42.301 --> 28:48.267
* we'll never get started *

28:48.267 --> 28:51.067
* and i don't want to wind up *

28:51.067 --> 28:53.267
* being parted *

28:53.267 --> 28:56.967
* broken-hearted *

28:56.967 --> 29:00.267
* so if you really love me *

29:00.267 --> 29:02.001
* say yes *

29:02.001 --> 29:04.500
* and please don't tell me *

29:04.500 --> 29:05.700
* perhaps *

29:05.700 --> 29:06.900
* perhaps *

29:06.900 --> 29:08.234
* perhaps *
