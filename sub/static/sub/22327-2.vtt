[loud clatter]

00:45.670 --> 00:46.880
[faint sigh]

00:55.180 --> 00:58.016
I am so sorry.

00:58.099 --> 01:00.977
[Randy]  How could he
be offering a Whistler chalet,

01:01.061 --> 01:03.354
a Tuscan villa
and a Caribbean hideaway

01:03.438 --> 01:05.857
all for $20,000?

01:06.691 --> 01:09.319
I gotta be honest,
I'm wondering the same thing.

01:09.402 --> 01:13.406
Look, I've been doing this a while,
and I have never seen a deal like this.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.326
So, which property appeals
to you the most?

01:16.409 --> 01:18.453
Maybe... the Caribbean hideaway?

01:18.536 --> 01:20.622
Don't we all wish
we were there right now?

01:21.206 --> 01:25.251
But seven to ten days a year,
that's like $2,000 a day.

01:25.335 --> 01:29.631
Yeah, if you only go once.
It's a lifestyle.

01:29.714 --> 01:32.091
Isn't that what you said
you were interested in, Dale?

01:32.175 --> 01:34.385
Yeah, I said that.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.679
But that was after you said
this would take 90 minutes,

01:36.763 --> 01:38.848
and we get a free dinner
at House of Rib.

01:39.432 --> 01:42.644
Ninety minutes. I hear ya.

01:48.608 --> 01:49.776
All right.

01:49.859 --> 01:52.654
I don't know how I'm gonna do it,
but let me go talk to my manager

01:52.737 --> 01:54.614
and see if we can do better.

01:54.697 --> 01:56.032
Give me five.

01:57.242 --> 02:01.079
When I come back,
you'll have a whole new perspective.

02:13.049 --> 02:13.883
[beep]

02:20.140 --> 02:23.518
[screams]

02:47.917 --> 02:49.335
[distant door opens]

02:50.712 --> 02:51.921
[door closes]

02:53.131 --> 02:54.549
[luggage drops]

02:56.009 --> 02:59.012
[approaching footsteps]

03:00.805 --> 03:01.723
[sharp gasp]

03:01.806 --> 03:03.141
Jesus. Kat.

03:03.224 --> 03:04.934
I thought you said the danger was over.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.604
-It is.
-Then why are you holding a gun?

03:07.687 --> 03:08.980
[MacLaren sighs]

03:09.063 --> 03:11.274
You didn't call back.
I thought you were at your mother's.

03:11.357 --> 03:12.984
Why didn't you say something
when you came in?

03:13.067 --> 03:14.569
I expected you to be at work.

03:14.652 --> 03:17.614
[sighs] I-I've been up all night.
I'm sorry.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.157
Doesn't matter. I'm glad you're home.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.618
I'm not home. I'm just here
to get a few things.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.121
I know the last couple of days
have been insane.

03:25.204 --> 03:28.041
[Kathryn] You know, I must have
left a dozen messages.

03:28.124 --> 03:31.127
Until I got yours
at four o'clock this morning,

03:31.210 --> 03:33.755
-I thought for sure you were dead.
-That's all over now.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.008
What's over? Tell me.

03:37.091 --> 03:38.801
You know I can't talk about my work.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.012
You've never said my life was in danger.

03:44.432 --> 03:47.018
Because of my work,
I was targeted by a--

03:47.101 --> 03:48.102
a group.

03:48.186 --> 03:50.605
And I was afraid by association
you might be in danger too.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.690
It's not the case.
They're no longer a threat.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.025
That's all I can say.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.904
How do I even know that's true?

03:57.987 --> 03:59.614
You're obviously capable of lying to me.

03:59.697 --> 04:01.824
Please stay and talk.
I'll make breakfast.

04:01.908 --> 04:03.159
No, I'm not gonna do that.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.245
Kat! Hey.

04:05.328 --> 04:07.288
What, are you planning on supervising?

04:08.957 --> 04:10.250
What do you want from me?

04:10.333 --> 04:12.585
I don't want anything from you, Grant,

04:12.669 --> 04:14.337
not a single thing.

04:22.303 --> 04:24.472
[trash truck beeping]

04:24.555 --> 04:26.182
[utensil clanks]

04:29.143 --> 04:30.395
David?

04:30.478 --> 04:33.523
[David] Hey. I made pancakes.

04:33.606 --> 04:35.441
You probably don't remember
what pancakes are,

04:35.525 --> 04:38.278
but I happen to know
that you like them a lot.

04:39.487 --> 04:40.488
[Marcy] What's wrong?

04:40.571 --> 04:42.490
Uh, nothing. Just, uh...

04:43.491 --> 04:45.493
you used to sleep naked
when we met,

04:45.576 --> 04:47.412
and I thought maybe you'd--

04:47.996 --> 04:49.414
[Marcy exhales]

04:49.497 --> 04:51.207
Nope. False alarm.

04:55.795 --> 04:57.005
How long you been up?

04:57.088 --> 04:58.840
Oh, since, uh...

05:00.508 --> 05:01.342
all night.

05:02.343 --> 05:04.929
I was thinking of maybe
watching some-- some TV,

05:05.013 --> 05:07.473
but then you were
all wrapped up cozy on the--

05:07.557 --> 05:10.101
on the-- on the couch,
and I didn't want to wake you,

05:10.184 --> 05:13.313
so, um, then I, uh...

05:13.396 --> 05:14.397
then I...

05:14.480 --> 05:15.898
Hey, you know what?

05:15.982 --> 05:18.234
Let's switch things up
and-- and-- and you sit here,

05:18.318 --> 05:19.861
'cause I'm always sittin' on this side.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.530
[Marcy] Oh, yeah. Yeah.

05:22.613 --> 05:23.489
[David] Thanks.

05:26.659 --> 05:27.493
Good.

05:32.540 --> 05:33.624
Are you okay?

05:33.708 --> 05:35.126
Hmm? Sure.

05:37.336 --> 05:38.337
I don't know.

05:39.547 --> 05:40.381
No.

05:41.966 --> 05:43.718
I mean, a strange man died

05:43.801 --> 05:46.721
right across from where
I eat my cereal every morning,

05:46.804 --> 05:49.223
and I'm just having
a... hard time dealing.

05:49.307 --> 05:51.476
-David, he was gonna kill you.
-That doesn't help.

05:51.559 --> 05:53.561
I was the one that he was looking for.

05:53.644 --> 05:54.645
That definitely doesn't.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.355
David, it's over.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.357
You're safe.

06:01.569 --> 06:04.906
Well, you know, that...
does make me feel a little bit better.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.410
[Rene]  Thought your parents
were never gonna leave.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.746
Yeah, they're just worried about me.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.540
Yeah, but the doctor said
it's just temporary, right?

06:14.624 --> 06:16.584
-Mm-hmm.
-And the swelling...

06:17.210 --> 06:18.044
does it hurt?

06:18.127 --> 06:18.961
No.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.005
You really can't feel anything?

06:21.089 --> 06:21.923
Mnh-mnh.

06:23.424 --> 06:24.717
Nothing?

06:24.801 --> 06:25.635
No.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.515
What about this?

06:30.598 --> 06:31.849
Whoa.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.309
Rene.

06:33.392 --> 06:35.561
The-- the nurse could
walk back in any minute.

06:35.645 --> 06:36.646
Bet you can feel that.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.606
Rene, please.

06:39.607 --> 06:40.441
Please.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.820
I'm still in recovery. I should rest.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.613
I shouldn't get too excited.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.951
Okay, babe. You rest.

06:51.285 --> 06:52.537
But I'll see you tomorrow...

06:53.579 --> 06:55.456
and the next day...

06:55.540 --> 06:56.916
and the next.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.465
[Grace] Do I have to listen
to that tomorrow,

07:04.549 --> 07:06.384
and the next day and the next?

07:09.428 --> 07:13.015
I almost pressed the call button because
I thought I was gonna throw up my lunch.

07:13.808 --> 07:14.725
She's very young.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.644
You're very old.

07:16.727 --> 07:17.979
I can't argue with that.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.730
You really don't feel anything yet?

07:19.814 --> 07:21.899
I mean, the amount
of medical nanites I gave you

07:21.983 --> 07:23.609
was barely above the minimum threshold,

07:23.693 --> 07:25.695
but I thought you'd have
some sensation by now.

07:25.778 --> 07:27.613
With age comes patience.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.450
How you feeling?

07:30.533 --> 07:31.909
Like I could walk out of here.

07:31.993 --> 07:35.371
But I'll have to fake it for a while
or they'll think I'm a medical miracle.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.789
Mmm.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.291
Besides, I love the food in here.

07:38.374 --> 07:39.792
It's amazing, right?

07:49.969 --> 07:50.803
[Jeff] Carly.

07:52.972 --> 07:53.806
Carly.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.057
What do you want?

07:55.141 --> 07:56.976
How about you answer your phone?

07:59.145 --> 08:01.147
I'm not here to creep,
just to say thanks.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.191
Thank your sergeant.
He made me give the statement.

08:03.274 --> 08:04.108
Oh, I did.

08:04.692 --> 08:06.986
Listen, I'm just as upset
about Jeffrey Jr. as you.

08:09.447 --> 08:11.365
I'm not even allowed to see him, Jeff.

08:11.449 --> 08:12.533
No contact.

08:12.617 --> 08:13.451
Me neither.

08:16.579 --> 08:17.497
You didn't know?

08:26.923 --> 08:28.007
Hey, partner.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.885
Everything all right?

08:30.968 --> 08:32.929
I just went into the wrong bathroom.

08:33.012 --> 08:33.846
[nervous chuckle]

08:33.930 --> 08:35.765
Back to basic training for you.

08:35.848 --> 08:36.849
What's this?

08:36.933 --> 08:38.768
Missing persons report.

08:38.851 --> 08:41.270
Doesn't missing persons
fall under local law enforcement?

08:41.354 --> 08:43.439
We come in if there's
an interstate component.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.357
Right.

08:44.440 --> 08:46.275
All six failed to check out
of the same hotel.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.693
Left all their belongings.

08:47.777 --> 08:50.279
Serenity Inn and Suites.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.698
So-- so I guess we have to go there.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.659
Yeah.

08:54.742 --> 08:57.411
We're FBI agents.
Badges and everything.

08:58.412 --> 09:00.081
All right, but, uh,

09:00.164 --> 09:01.457
can you drive?

09:02.291 --> 09:03.834
You just need practice.

09:05.753 --> 09:07.088
Who'd like to start?

09:11.551 --> 09:12.885
Hi, my name is Philip,

09:12.969 --> 09:14.387
and I am an addict.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.930
[group] Hi, Philip.

09:16.764 --> 09:20.101
You know, the hardest part
about this is admitting to yourself

09:20.184 --> 09:21.644
that you're not strong enough--

09:21.727 --> 09:24.272
uh, that you can't just stop,

09:24.355 --> 09:26.107
even when you know
what it's doing to you.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.485
I was doing really well. I was.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.946
And then I lost somebody close to me.

09:32.822 --> 09:36.284
Technically not, uh, "lost" lost.

09:36.367 --> 09:39.287
She's still in my life,
but she's just, uh...

09:41.581 --> 09:43.583
[low] It's impossible to explain.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.668
I feel like she's gone.

09:47.211 --> 09:49.088
At least a part of her is.

09:51.591 --> 09:55.136
Anyway... I miss her.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.762
[Colin] Thank you, Philip.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.431
[man] Thanks, Philip.

09:59.432 --> 10:00.850
Who'd like to go next?

10:12.820 --> 10:13.654
Hi.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.284
I'm sorry about your friend.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.078
Thanks.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.206
We need all the support
we can get, right?

10:30.588 --> 10:32.548
I'm Traveler 4514.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.427
The Director assigned me
to help you.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.142
[distant ship horn wails]

10:43.225 --> 10:44.685
[David] Well, you're right.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.395
A little fresh air is nice.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.898
[Marcy sighs]
It's important not to get fixated.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.484
Am I fixated?

10:53.277 --> 10:54.403
Yeah, I was.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.238
It's normal to be rattled by trauma.

10:56.322 --> 10:59.283
You just want to make sure it doesn't tip
into something more serious.

10:59.367 --> 11:00.785
Like what?

11:00.868 --> 11:02.328
Here, let's sit.

11:05.289 --> 11:06.290
[ship horn blares]

11:06.374 --> 11:07.208
Jesus!

11:09.293 --> 11:12.129
I think you're experiencing early symptoms
of PTSD.

11:13.714 --> 11:14.924
That's ridiculous.

11:15.007 --> 11:19.136
Soldiers in battle get PTSD.
First responders of horrible disasters--

11:19.220 --> 11:21.514
Heightened anxiety.
Inability to sleep.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.058
Exaggerated startle response.

11:24.892 --> 11:27.812
"Exaggerated star--"
You just made that one up.

11:27.895 --> 11:29.146
I'm fine.

11:31.315 --> 11:33.401
I mean, technically
it's too early to diagnose,

11:33.484 --> 11:34.902
but early treatment won't hurt,

11:34.985 --> 11:36.570
and it should help, so...

11:36.654 --> 11:37.738
Here. Come here.

11:41.117 --> 11:42.326
Give me your hands.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.329
I want you to close your eyes.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.333
Now, think about what happened
to you while you focus on my tapping.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.710
Okay?

11:53.921 --> 11:55.673
Seriously? Is this a real thing?

11:55.756 --> 11:58.384
'Cause it-- it feels a little bullshitty.

12:04.557 --> 12:05.975
No, you know what?
I'm-- I'm sorry.

12:06.058 --> 12:06.892
I, uh...

12:09.562 --> 12:10.896
Could we just keep walking?

12:12.565 --> 12:14.650
Yeah. Good idea.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.321
You know what?
I'm gonna head back to the apartment.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.739
I'll meet you back there.

12:21.740 --> 12:22.741
Where you goin'?

12:22.825 --> 12:24.785
To get something that'll help.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.039
Okay.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.045
[David exhales]

12:37.631 --> 12:39.633
[Philip] So your mission is to help me?

12:40.468 --> 12:43.679
Specifically to... give you this.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.640
Eye drops.

12:46.724 --> 12:49.894
Synthetic compound
to help with the heroin addiction.

It's invented 20 years or so from now.

Naloxone, buprenorphine,

12:56.358 --> 13:00.529
and some other things that are
even harder to pronounce.

13:00.613 --> 13:04.325
But it will stop the craving
and curb your withdrawal.

13:04.408 --> 13:06.118
And I'm just getting this now?

13:06.660 --> 13:08.662
Well, hey, I-I know you were trying hard,

13:08.746 --> 13:12.416
but then you had the setback
when you got captured, they gave you--

13:12.500 --> 13:13.667
How'd you know about that?

13:15.419 --> 13:16.879
The future?

13:17.713 --> 13:20.341
Maybe the Director figured you'd quit
on your own,

13:20.424 --> 13:22.134
and you couldn't do it.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.774
There, see? It's perfectly--

13:36.857 --> 13:38.943
[gasping]

13:39.026 --> 13:42.363
[coughing]

13:46.617 --> 13:47.618
[laughing]

13:47.701 --> 13:50.037
-That wasn't funny.
-Yes, it was.

13:53.832 --> 13:56.126
One drop per eye or as needed.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.131
Jenny, by the way.

14:19.483 --> 14:20.568
These are amazing.

14:20.651 --> 14:21.861
Yep.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.112
Now what do we do?

14:23.195 --> 14:24.822
Whatever you want.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.450
What are you gonna do?

14:30.119 --> 14:32.955
Did you receive any training
on the simulator?

14:33.581 --> 14:34.707
You had a simulator?

14:34.790 --> 14:36.083
Wow. Okay.

14:36.166 --> 14:39.712
Uh... just loosen up on the wheel
and try to get out of your head.

14:39.795 --> 14:42.131
-[tires screech]
-You know, sing a song or something.

14:43.883 --> 14:45.092
Doesn't have to be a song.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.011
Just recite something you know by heart.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.721
List-- list the protocols.

14:48.804 --> 14:50.639
Uh, protocol one.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.350
Uh... mission comes first.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.436
Uh, two, leave the future in the past.

14:55.519 --> 14:56.896
[MacLaren] Better. Turn up here.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.230
[Forbes] Protocol three,

14:58.314 --> 15:00.816
don't take a life, don't save a life,
unless otherwise directed.

15:00.900 --> 15:01.734
Good.

15:01.817 --> 15:04.028
Protocol four, uh, don't reproduce.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.112
Don't reproduce.

15:05.195 --> 15:08.282
[uneven revving, tires squealing]

15:18.334 --> 15:20.544
I don't know how the hell
you got to work today.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.171
Uh, just like that.

15:22.254 --> 15:25.674
Yeah, well, protocol two isn't
going to get you out of practice.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.217
Hold on a sec. Kat?

15:27.301 --> 15:29.303
[Kat]  You're right, we should talk.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.473
[MacLaren] Great.
Come by the house tonight. I'll make--

15:32.556 --> 15:34.475
I'm staying at Nicole's while she's away.

15:34.558 --> 15:36.060
I'll text you the address.

15:36.143 --> 15:37.686
Sure. You want me to bring any--

15:37.770 --> 15:39.188
[phone beeps]

15:45.945 --> 15:48.697
[Jeff] They took away our son.
We need to be on the same side.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.240
[Carly] You charged me with assault.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.368
Blocked me from getting a job.

15:52.451 --> 15:54.662
Told the judge I was an unfit mother.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.372
You have every right to be pissed at me,

15:56.455 --> 15:58.457
but I did those things
because I was pissed at you.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.377
So, how about we stop being pissed
at each other

16:01.460 --> 16:03.087
and see what happens?

16:05.172 --> 16:07.299
When I saw that girl about
to shoot you...

16:08.592 --> 16:09.593
I just felt...

16:13.389 --> 16:16.058
I can't imagine what I'd do
if I lost you for good.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.187
Yeah, I guess I never did thank you
for that.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.189
Hmm... well, you still haven't.

16:22.272 --> 16:23.107
Thank you.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.235
You're welcome.

16:37.371 --> 16:39.331
So, walk us through. What happened?

16:39.415 --> 16:41.542
[stammers] The seminar was going great.

16:41.625 --> 16:44.545
I had two buyers on the hook,
maybe three,

16:44.628 --> 16:48.841
and then I left the room near the end
to go get my manager.

16:48.924 --> 16:52.261
We usually offer a slightly better deal
to really drive it home.

16:52.344 --> 16:53.178
Sure.

16:53.262 --> 16:56.682
Except when I came back
20 minutes later, they were gone.

16:57.349 --> 16:58.767
Twenty minutes?

16:58.851 --> 17:01.061
[Randy] It's a sales technique.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.938
Just... let 'em stew on it a little bit.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.357
Guess it wasn't such a great deal.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.943
Can you show us the security footage?

17:08.944 --> 17:10.112
[door closes]

17:10.195 --> 17:11.030
Mr. Conway?

17:11.113 --> 17:12.197
[lock beeps]

17:15.451 --> 17:17.536
Son of a bitch!

17:21.582 --> 17:22.416
That way.

17:27.546 --> 17:28.547
Hey!

17:30.007 --> 17:31.008
[Randy] Okay, okay.

17:31.091 --> 17:33.927
Running from a federal agent
makes it look like you did something bad.

17:34.011 --> 17:34.845
No, I--

17:34.928 --> 17:35.888
[Forbes] Freeze!

17:35.971 --> 17:36.805
[Randy gasps]

17:36.889 --> 17:39.308
I think I got it, Ace. Put it away.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.310
All I did was lock the door
to keep them inside.

17:41.393 --> 17:42.811
I know it goes against fire code--

17:42.895 --> 17:44.521
I don't give a shit
about the fire code, Randy!

17:44.605 --> 17:46.607
There are six people missing.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.108
I don't know what happened to them.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.986
I came back, and they were gone. I swear.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.905
The security tape?

17:52.988 --> 17:54.531
[Randy groans]

17:56.992 --> 17:58.619
[rattles knob]

17:58.702 --> 18:00.829
[knocks on door]

18:00.913 --> 18:02.081
[David] Marce?

18:02.164 --> 18:04.166
Hey. My key isn't working.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.465
Hi.

18:12.466 --> 18:13.842
Hey.

18:13.926 --> 18:17.012
I stopped by the hardware store
on the way home and, uh...

18:17.096 --> 18:18.222
turns out

18:18.305 --> 18:19.890
they were havin'

18:19.973 --> 18:21.100
a big

18:21.183 --> 18:22.309
sale on locks.

18:22.392 --> 18:23.227
[snaps fingers]

18:23.310 --> 18:24.394
Yay, safety.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.731
Why don't you have a seat?

18:32.653 --> 18:34.863
[Randy] Now we only use this
for training purposes.

18:34.947 --> 18:35.948
[MacLaren] We don't care.

18:36.031 --> 18:37.491
[Randy] Right. Okay.

18:37.574 --> 18:39.451
[Forbes] Can I have one of these?

18:39.535 --> 18:41.745
Sure, yeah. But they're a day old.

18:43.163 --> 18:44.790
Press play, please.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.981
You didn't tamper with this, did you?

19:09.064 --> 19:10.399
No. No, I swear.

19:10.482 --> 19:11.900
You can stop swearing.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.527
Did you have more plans for the group?

19:13.610 --> 19:15.737
We were gonna shuttle them
to our sister location

19:15.821 --> 19:17.447
to pick up their free dinner vouchers.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.783
-In the shuttle bus outside?
-Yeah. Yeah, why?

19:20.367 --> 19:21.493
Might want to get your brakes checked.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.209
What is this?

19:29.293 --> 19:33.255
This is an eye movement
therapy kit to treat PTSD.

19:36.008 --> 19:36.842
All right.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.760
Follow the light with your eyes.

19:40.762 --> 19:43.891
I want you to think about what you were
doing moments before the man arrived.

19:46.810 --> 19:48.312
I was washing dishes.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.689
[Marcy] Concentrate on how you felt.

19:52.941 --> 19:54.651
What happened next?

19:56.028 --> 19:57.529
Drying the dishes.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.040
I-I-I don't see how this--

20:08.123 --> 20:10.417
This is part of
the desensitization process.

20:11.251 --> 20:12.711
Here, give me your hands.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.047
Close your eyes.

20:16.048 --> 20:16.882
All right.

20:24.181 --> 20:25.098
[knock on door]

20:31.647 --> 20:33.565
[gasps] Forced his way in.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.275
How did you feel when that happened?

20:37.611 --> 20:38.487
[David groans]

20:44.493 --> 20:46.286
[David grunts]

20:47.287 --> 20:48.288
He kept hitting me.

20:51.291 --> 20:53.919
-[Marcy] Hey, David. David. David.
-No.

20:54.002 --> 20:55.254
[gunshot]

20:55.337 --> 20:56.463
No!

20:57.422 --> 20:59.007
[Marcy] Hey, hey, hey, hey.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.259
I'm right here.

21:00.342 --> 21:01.885
Hey, look at me. Hey.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.720
You're fine. I am right here.

21:03.804 --> 21:04.888
Okay?

21:04.972 --> 21:07.266
You're fine. You're fine.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.395
Why do you figure that they
put a hole in them?

21:12.104 --> 21:14.940
Let's concentrate
on one mystery at a time, shall we?

21:15.023 --> 21:16.900
-Um...
-[muzak playing overhead]

21:16.984 --> 21:19.611
New arrivals cause static
on video cameras,

21:19.695 --> 21:23.115
so it's pretty obvious
that it's six new Travelers.

21:23.198 --> 21:25.617
With a total disregard for protocol five.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.411
Well, maybe they're working on a mission.

21:27.494 --> 21:30.831
Let's be sure. In the meantime,
we bury any connection to this hotel.

21:30.914 --> 21:32.332
Philip, you there?

21:32.416 --> 21:33.417
[Philip]  Yeah, go ahead.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.544
Leaving what looks like the scene
of a mass arrival.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.422
Six people in a hotel conference room.
Do you remember anything about

21:38.505 --> 21:40.632
a group of Travelers arriving today
in Bellingham?

21:40.716 --> 21:42.342
[Philip]
How were they supposed to die?

21:42.426 --> 21:44.845
I'm just guessing,
but something with a shuttle bus.

21:44.928 --> 21:45.929
Brake failure, maybe.

21:46.013 --> 21:48.598
Nothing like that today, but you know
the timeline's been changing.

21:48.682 --> 21:51.727
Yeah. Maybe they went missing
for a different reason.

21:53.061 --> 21:55.230
You mean like how we went missing?

21:55.314 --> 21:56.732
Let's hope not.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.442
I'll keep on it.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.610
-[faint beep]
-Sorry about that.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.654
[Jenny chuckles] Must be a relief.

22:02.738 --> 22:03.864
What?

22:03.947 --> 22:05.949
If you're seeing changes
in the timeline,

22:06.033 --> 22:08.243
it'll mean you won't
have to carry the burden

22:08.327 --> 22:10.329
of knowing everyone
who's about to die.

22:10.412 --> 22:11.747
Maybe eventually.

22:12.748 --> 22:15.834
It's amazing how little has changed,
considering everything we've done.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.963
I know what happened
with Aleksander Andreiko.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.883
Maybe we shouldn't be
talking about that.

22:22.966 --> 22:24.885
Hey, I agree with what you did.

22:24.968 --> 22:26.678
You saved that kid's life.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.972
You know,
the Director isn't perfect.

22:29.639 --> 22:31.433
We definitely shouldn't be
talking about that.

22:31.516 --> 22:34.102
[Jenny] Don't forget, we created it.

22:34.186 --> 22:38.273
The Director might not be able
to break the rules, but... we can.

22:39.441 --> 22:41.276
[Philip chuckles]

22:41.359 --> 22:42.194
What?

22:43.695 --> 22:46.364
I feel like I'm waiting
to be struck by lightning.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.951
Not a black cloud in the sky.

23:01.755 --> 23:02.964
Come on.

23:04.466 --> 23:05.675
Where are we going?

23:07.803 --> 23:09.221
It's a surprise.

23:14.684 --> 23:15.936
[Marcy] Here.

23:16.019 --> 23:17.062
Is that any better?

23:17.813 --> 23:19.147
I have no idea.

23:20.148 --> 23:22.567
I have another, different treatment.

23:24.402 --> 23:25.612
Could it be later?

23:26.947 --> 23:27.781
Sure.

23:34.830 --> 23:37.958
Although sometimes medicine
is the best medicine.

23:38.041 --> 23:40.335
Cannabis is known
to help with symptoms of--

23:40.418 --> 23:41.628
Absolutely, it's known to.

23:43.672 --> 23:45.173
You need to inhale the smoke.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.883
Oh, I'm familiar with the process.

23:55.517 --> 23:59.563
[exhales]

23:59.646 --> 24:01.982
You know,
it's excellent for memory loss, too.

24:08.446 --> 24:10.448
[knocking on door]

24:15.871 --> 24:17.289
[door lock clacks]

24:18.623 --> 24:19.457
Hey.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.127
Hi.

24:22.210 --> 24:23.044
Come in.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.216
Wow. This is nice.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.301
[Kat chuckles]

24:29.384 --> 24:32.596
You've been here before.
We helped her move in.

24:32.679 --> 24:36.433
[MacLaren] Right. All I remember is boxes.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.021
[Kathryn] What are you doing?

24:44.316 --> 24:45.358
I'll take some wine.

24:51.781 --> 24:53.909
So, how long is Nicole away?

24:53.992 --> 24:54.826
All year.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.620
She's on sabbatical.

25:03.585 --> 25:04.669
What's that?

25:05.921 --> 25:07.339
Separation papers.

25:08.590 --> 25:09.591
They have to be filed.

25:09.674 --> 25:10.967
Wait, wait, wait, you--

25:11.051 --> 25:12.636
you're talking divorce?

25:12.719 --> 25:14.554
You broke your vows, Grant.

25:14.638 --> 25:17.390
And I told you,
it's the worst mistake I ever made.

25:18.225 --> 25:19.059
-Shit!
-Ohh.

25:19.142 --> 25:20.185
No, don't touch it.

25:20.268 --> 25:21.102
I'm sorry.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.190
Ohh. [winces]

25:25.273 --> 25:26.608
You're bleeding.

25:27.442 --> 25:28.443
Yeah.

25:29.319 --> 25:30.654
I'll get it.

25:30.737 --> 25:31.738
You, uh, have any--

25:31.821 --> 25:33.448
Yeah, yeah, in the bathroom.

26:09.401 --> 26:10.527
Everything all right?

26:13.488 --> 26:14.698
I gotta go.

26:14.781 --> 26:16.908
No, not before you sign these, Grant.

26:16.992 --> 26:17.826
I--

26:23.999 --> 26:24.833
Thank you.

26:26.209 --> 26:27.794
-Are you okay?
-[door slams]

26:33.008 --> 26:34.843
[Grace sighs]

26:34.926 --> 26:36.136
Trevor, you asleep?

26:37.595 --> 26:40.140
[Trevor] Uh... I was.

26:41.725 --> 26:42.892
I was dreaming.

26:42.976 --> 26:43.810
About what?

26:45.812 --> 26:47.814
I was walking in the park.

26:48.648 --> 26:50.150
I don't dream much.

26:51.151 --> 26:52.319
I can tell.

26:53.403 --> 26:55.113
Sorry, I shouldn't have woken you.

26:56.448 --> 26:59.951
I'm just used to being able to have
intelligent conversations 24/7.

27:00.827 --> 27:02.537
I thought you weren't a people person.

27:02.620 --> 27:05.165
-Who said that?
-Ellis.

27:06.249 --> 27:07.083
Oh.

27:09.794 --> 27:12.213
He was right, actually,
but I was talking about the Director,

27:12.297 --> 27:15.592
lamenting... those conversations
are over now.

27:15.675 --> 27:17.594
I talked to the Director a few times.

27:17.677 --> 27:19.387
I talked to it endlessly.

27:22.015 --> 27:24.017
I don't know what to do with myself.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.019
Protocol five.
You can counsel children.

27:26.102 --> 27:28.730
Please. I said intelligent conversation.

27:29.939 --> 27:31.524
So, you miss the Director?

27:33.276 --> 27:35.987
Huh. I think I do.

27:37.072 --> 27:38.281
Interesting.

27:40.867 --> 27:42.285
You miss her, don't you?

27:44.454 --> 27:46.456
I can tell by the way you look at me.

27:46.539 --> 27:48.750
What you see is my realization

27:48.833 --> 27:50.668
that instead of saving Grace's life,

27:50.752 --> 27:52.962
I made her last few hours terrifying.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.590
I guess I've cheated death for so long,

27:55.673 --> 27:58.301
I thought that I could do the same
for somebody else.

27:58.385 --> 28:00.136
But I've lived long enough
to know better.

28:00.220 --> 28:03.681
Well, try to understand, the Faction
had already corrupted the Director.

28:03.765 --> 28:05.225
The grand plan was in jeopardy.

28:05.308 --> 28:06.726
I understand.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.116
[man]  Ladies and gentlemen,

28:21.199 --> 28:24.202
please give a warm welcome
to our speaker for this evening,

28:24.285 --> 28:26.037
Dr. Edwin Calloway.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.039
[applause]

28:31.459 --> 28:32.961
[low] You can't be serious.

28:35.046 --> 28:36.047
Edwin Calloway?

28:36.131 --> 28:38.550
You know how much hatred
and intolerance this guy inspires?

28:38.633 --> 28:43.263
Immigration is the true test of a nation,

28:43.346 --> 28:47.183
because the nation needs to be
strong enough to survive it.

28:47.267 --> 28:49.477
Too much accommodation...

28:49.561 --> 28:52.439
[low] This guy is a racist dick.
I am not watching this.

28:52.522 --> 28:53.857
[low] Shh. Just wait.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.650
[Calloway] How many people here today feel

28:55.734 --> 28:58.862
like this country is headed
in the right direction?

28:58.945 --> 29:02.365
And how many feel like
their cultures and traditions

29:02.449 --> 29:04.868
are being respected by the people

29:04.951 --> 29:07.787
they suddenly find taking their jobs,

29:07.871 --> 29:09.789
dating their daughters?

29:09.873 --> 29:11.374
[low murmuring]

29:11.458 --> 29:14.085
Well, there's a reason
you all feel this way.

29:15.170 --> 29:19.174
Their cultures don't respect your culture.

29:20.884 --> 29:22.051
[audience murmurs]

29:23.845 --> 29:25.847
That's a mistake.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.515
All right, shut it off.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.851
-Shut it off!
-[amused clamor]

29:29.934 --> 29:31.269
Shut it off!

29:33.563 --> 29:37.525
[both panting]

29:37.609 --> 29:38.443
You did that?

29:38.526 --> 29:40.528
Still not struck by lightning.

29:48.995 --> 29:49.996
[Jenny chuckles]

29:50.997 --> 29:51.998
Here.

29:52.999 --> 29:54.000
No, thanks, I feel fine.

29:54.083 --> 29:56.878
Yeah, but do you want to feel amazing?

30:05.094 --> 30:06.346
Damn.

30:06.429 --> 30:09.015
[Jenny laughs]

30:09.098 --> 30:09.933
[Philip chuckles]

30:31.955 --> 30:33.706
-Okay.
-[Jenny chuckles]

30:37.627 --> 30:40.046
Mm. Hold on, hold on, hold on.

30:40.129 --> 30:41.548
-[Jenny] Okay.
-[Philip] Hold on.

30:44.884 --> 30:46.302
Protocol four, right?

30:55.854 --> 30:58.273
[exhales] What was I saying?

31:00.483 --> 31:03.695
Uh... that you should sell
the apartment.

31:03.778 --> 31:04.612
Right.

31:06.281 --> 31:09.409
Although, I think you've got to say
if someone died, you know,

31:09.492 --> 31:11.119
on the disclosure forms.

31:11.202 --> 31:14.414
Just re-stain the floors
and nobody needs to know.

31:14.497 --> 31:18.877
See? That's why you're an FBI doctor.

31:23.298 --> 31:24.299
Who am I kidding?

31:25.466 --> 31:27.093
I can't sell this place.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.096
All my stuff's here.

31:32.515 --> 31:34.350
Oh, man, I'm really feeling this.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.522
I don't feel anything.

31:47.739 --> 31:48.740
[Forbes] Hey, Mac.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.410
Whatever it is,
try figuring it out on your own.

31:52.493 --> 31:54.537
I just did. Come on, check this out.

31:58.917 --> 32:01.544
Two of our missing people
were just flagged in Sacramento.

32:01.628 --> 32:04.047
Local PD got 'em for running a red light.

32:04.130 --> 32:06.549
Dale Miller and Meredith Gilroy.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.635
Looks like they don't know
how to drive, either.

32:08.718 --> 32:12.180
I suggested that these two
were just having an affair.

32:12.263 --> 32:13.473
What about the others?

32:13.556 --> 32:16.059
Technically, no longer
under our jurisdiction.

32:16.142 --> 32:18.144
Local PD took it back.

32:19.270 --> 32:20.897
There's hope for you yet.

32:29.656 --> 32:30.907
-Hey.
-Hey.

32:32.367 --> 32:33.576
What is this?

32:33.660 --> 32:35.662
I got a present for you.

32:36.496 --> 32:37.330
Wow.

32:38.331 --> 32:39.874
Looks great. It, uh...

32:40.959 --> 32:43.711
-Even covers up the--
-Yeah, that's kind of the... idea.

32:43.795 --> 32:44.879
Yeah.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.381
I got you a present, too.

32:47.382 --> 32:48.591
Yay, safety.

32:48.675 --> 32:50.301
I'm not gonna be needing those.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.720
Um... I'm not staying.

32:52.804 --> 32:53.638
What?

32:53.721 --> 32:56.975
You can continue the therapy
on your own as you feel you need it,

32:57.058 --> 32:59.560
but I can already tell
that you're getting better.

32:59.644 --> 33:02.021
Whe-when did you decide this?

33:03.147 --> 33:05.858
I was told my living here
was always temporary.

33:05.942 --> 33:07.944
You can't just buy me
a goodbye rug and then--

33:08.027 --> 33:10.989
David, you went through
a traumatic experience.

33:11.072 --> 33:12.615
Yeah, I'm feeling
another one coming on.

33:12.699 --> 33:14.200
Keep up with your treatments and--

33:14.283 --> 33:15.910
Don't talk to me like I'm a patient.

33:15.994 --> 33:17.996
I'm responsible for what happened.

33:20.748 --> 33:22.750
-You said we were safe.
-You are, but...

33:23.751 --> 33:25.044
You'll be safer without me.

33:25.128 --> 33:26.796
How is that even possible?

33:26.879 --> 33:29.173
-You're the one who saved me.
-And look at the result.

33:29.257 --> 33:32.719
I mean, your anxiety
may never completely go away.

33:33.428 --> 33:35.054
I did that to you.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.016
[David chuckles]

33:41.436 --> 33:44.188
You asked before
if we were intimate, and...

33:45.857 --> 33:48.234
I didn't know what to say
because, I mean...

33:49.652 --> 33:51.154
I don't know, because I'm an idiot.

33:51.237 --> 33:53.156
But what I should have said was yes...

33:54.282 --> 33:55.491
we were intimate.

33:57.618 --> 33:59.245
I love you, Marcy.

34:00.663 --> 34:03.624
And you love me,
you just don't... remember.

34:05.460 --> 34:06.461
You're right.

34:08.880 --> 34:09.881
I don't.

34:11.674 --> 34:13.676
But I do care about you.

34:18.181 --> 34:20.808
Enough to leave.

34:32.570 --> 34:35.782
[woman] I understand this is
a difficult time for both of you.

34:35.865 --> 34:38.659
But the 72-hour dependency action
was filed,

34:38.743 --> 34:41.162
and Jeffrey Jr. will be in the care
of the state

34:41.245 --> 34:42.830
until the next assessment.

34:42.914 --> 34:45.833
That's why we're here.
We need to see him.

34:45.917 --> 34:48.961
Not until the next hearing, I'm sorry.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.671
Trust that he's in a good home.

34:50.755 --> 34:52.173
I'm his father.

34:52.256 --> 34:53.716
I have a right to see my son.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.885
The action was filed for Jeffrey's safety.

34:55.968 --> 34:56.803
[Carly] By who?

34:58.513 --> 34:59.931
It was you, wasn't it?

35:00.014 --> 35:03.601
When we received information
regarding the police incident--

35:03.684 --> 35:04.685
[Jeff] Okay, hold on.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.187
I was cleared of all charges--

35:06.270 --> 35:09.690
I called you, Mr. Conniker,
and we spoke at length.

35:09.774 --> 35:13.027
But I understand why you may
forget the conversation.

35:15.947 --> 35:18.950
We also tried unsuccessfully
to contact you, Ms. Shannon.

35:21.786 --> 35:22.787
So, what do we do?

35:22.870 --> 35:24.872
Based on your current behavior
and your history...

35:25.873 --> 35:29.710
I think it might be time
to consider allowing another guardian

35:29.794 --> 35:32.797
to take care of Jeffrey... indefinitely.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.299
I'm not gonna give my son
over to some stranger.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.677
Unless things radically change,

35:37.760 --> 35:41.472
that is going to remain
Jeffrey Jr.'s best option.

35:45.059 --> 35:47.520
-[Marcy] Philip!
-Yeah, just one minute.

35:50.982 --> 35:51.858
Who are you?

35:53.359 --> 35:54.360
This is Jenny.

35:54.443 --> 35:55.736
Hi.

35:55.820 --> 35:56.696
Hello.

35:57.572 --> 35:59.240
Philip, could I talk to you
for a second?

36:16.382 --> 36:18.217
Did you bring a 21st-er to ops?

36:19.051 --> 36:20.553
Actually, she's a Traveler.

36:20.636 --> 36:22.763
And that's better how?

36:23.347 --> 36:25.391
-[Jenny] So, I'm gonna go.
-Good idea.

36:27.602 --> 36:28.978
Talk to you later?

36:31.981 --> 36:32.982
What's going on?

36:33.065 --> 36:34.609
I'm clean, Marcy.

36:34.692 --> 36:37.236
That's how we met.
The Director sent her to help me.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.363
[unzips]

36:39.447 --> 36:42.617
A synthesized drug
to help me get off heroin.

36:43.618 --> 36:45.494
I need to know what this is made of.

36:45.578 --> 36:47.038
Naloxone, buprenorphine.

36:47.121 --> 36:48.831
And some other things.

36:48.915 --> 36:50.041
What other things?

36:50.124 --> 36:52.293
I don't care. It works.

36:52.376 --> 36:54.879
My body doesn't hurt when I'm not high,
I have a normal life.

36:54.962 --> 36:56.923
There's nothing normal about this!

36:57.006 --> 36:58.049
Why?

37:00.134 --> 37:01.761
[Philip] Because I met someone?

37:04.847 --> 37:06.224
You have somebody.

37:06.307 --> 37:07.516
Not anymore.

37:09.435 --> 37:13.689
I'm gonna have to stay here for a while
till I find my own place.

37:13.773 --> 37:14.815
Of course.

37:15.816 --> 37:17.485
This place is yours, too.

37:18.653 --> 37:19.487
You okay?

37:20.655 --> 37:21.656
I'm fine.

37:27.536 --> 37:28.746
[Dr. Mori] Mr. Holden.

37:28.829 --> 37:30.081
[Trevor] Mr. Doc.

37:30.164 --> 37:32.375
What's the prognosis?

37:32.458 --> 37:33.751
Still a lot of inflammation.

37:33.834 --> 37:36.629
Do you feel anything yet?
Even pins and needles?

37:37.463 --> 37:38.464
I think so.

37:38.547 --> 37:40.258
It's hard to say.

37:40.341 --> 37:44.136
Well, let's, uh, do the test again.

37:44.845 --> 37:47.265
Ow! Ah, I felt that.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.976
And movement.
That is excellent. Excellent.

37:50.059 --> 37:52.228
-So, does this mean--
-It means there's hope.

37:53.062 --> 37:54.397
[Trevor] Wow.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.065
Thank you so much.

37:56.148 --> 37:57.775
Would you like me to contact your folks?

37:57.858 --> 38:00.903
I-I would like that very much, yes,
because they'll want to thank you, too.

38:00.987 --> 38:04.740
I'll check in again before I go today,
but how about one of these, buddy?

38:04.824 --> 38:06.492
-All right.
-[both laugh]

38:06.575 --> 38:09.996
[Trevor chuckling]

38:12.164 --> 38:12.999
Hope?

38:14.125 --> 38:16.961
There are medical nanites
designed in the future

38:17.044 --> 38:18.504
swimming through your spinal fluid

38:18.587 --> 38:20.840
that I programmed personally
repairing the damage.

38:20.923 --> 38:21.924
There was never any doubt.

38:22.008 --> 38:25.052
Well, I wanted him to feel good
about the job that they did.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.721
Well, I want them to bring breakfast.

38:26.804 --> 38:29.432
They're half an hour late already,
and I'm starving.

38:30.391 --> 38:31.851
Thank you for saving me, Grace.

38:31.934 --> 38:35.730
-[low] You already said that.
-[call button beeping]

39:27.156 --> 39:27.990
Hi.

39:28.074 --> 39:28.908
Come on in.

39:45.591 --> 39:46.926
Carly, what are you doing?

39:47.009 --> 39:48.010
What do you think?

39:48.094 --> 39:49.887
You're not gonna find anything.

39:49.970 --> 39:52.223
I told you, I stopped drinking.
This is for real.

39:52.306 --> 39:53.516
No, Jeff.

39:53.599 --> 39:55.518
This is for show.

39:55.601 --> 39:57.353
And you'd better not screw it up.

39:58.354 --> 40:01.190
Because this is our one chance
to get Jeffrey back.

40:01.273 --> 40:02.733
[Jeff] Don't worry.

40:02.817 --> 40:03.943
It's gonna work.

40:04.819 --> 40:09.073
The big question is,
where do I put my, uh, my stuff?

40:14.036 --> 40:15.037
By the couch.

40:17.706 --> 40:19.333
[Jeff sighs]

40:19.417 --> 40:20.251
[Carly sighs]

40:20.334 --> 40:22.545
[Jeff] Hey, um, you hungry?
I was thinkin'--

40:28.551 --> 40:29.969
[knock on door]

40:33.431 --> 40:38.269
[lock buzzes]

40:40.855 --> 40:42.273
[door closes]

40:43.274 --> 40:46.944
She's not here, is she?
The bitchy little blonde?

40:47.027 --> 40:48.028
[chuckles]

40:48.863 --> 40:51.073
Marcy is out looking for an apartment.

40:51.157 --> 40:52.575
That's why I texted.

40:54.410 --> 40:55.411
You seen this?

40:57.288 --> 40:59.123
His followers went nuts on him.

40:59.206 --> 41:00.499
And then, this morning,

41:00.583 --> 41:04.587
he woke up, shot his wife
and his kid before he killed himself.

41:04.670 --> 41:06.547
-Philip, I know.
-His wife and child are dead...

41:06.630 --> 41:07.715
and it's our fault.

41:07.798 --> 41:10.384
-You mean my fault.
-I mean this is fucked-up, Jenny.

41:10.468 --> 41:11.469
No. It really isn't!

41:11.552 --> 41:14.388
None of this would have happened
if you hadn't hacked his presentation.

41:14.472 --> 41:17.099
Probably would have gone on
spewing hate

41:17.183 --> 41:20.561
that led to the deaths
of hundreds of people.

41:20.644 --> 41:21.479
Thousands.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.273
You tell me.
You're the historian.

41:24.356 --> 41:25.357
It's not up to us.

41:25.441 --> 41:27.860
I didn't tell him to kill his family.

41:27.943 --> 41:30.571
All I did was tell the truth.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.408
And his wife and child?

41:34.492 --> 41:37.953
The world is a better place
without Edwin Calloway.

41:38.037 --> 41:41.624
And I'm sorry, maybe he took
some innocent people down with him,

41:41.707 --> 41:43.876
but I refuse to feel guilty about it.

41:44.460 --> 41:46.378
Yeah, well, the Director's gonna know.

41:46.962 --> 41:49.423
If the Director thought
what we were doing was wrong,

41:49.507 --> 41:51.133
why didn't I get a Messenger?

41:52.927 --> 41:54.929
Orders from another team to back off?

41:57.473 --> 42:00.893
Can you look me in the eye and tell me
what I did was not a good thing?

42:21.539 --> 42:23.874
-Kat.
-Grant, what are you doing here?

42:23.958 --> 42:27.461
-You can't just show up here whenever--
-Kat, I know.

42:27.545 --> 42:28.379
What?

42:28.462 --> 42:29.838
That you're pregnant.

42:31.549 --> 42:33.968
What, did you show your badge
to my obstetrician?

42:34.051 --> 42:36.428
No. Can I come in?

42:37.763 --> 42:39.181
[MacLaren sighs]

42:39.265 --> 42:41.767
I saw your supplements in the bathroom.

42:43.394 --> 42:44.603
You went through my things?

42:44.687 --> 42:47.523
Yes, I did, and you can give me
shit for that after we talk.

42:47.606 --> 42:49.191
No, I am not doing that.

42:49.275 --> 42:50.276
Yes, you are.

42:51.277 --> 42:52.111
Kat.

42:53.404 --> 42:55.239
It happened the night
of your surprise party,

42:55.322 --> 42:57.449
the one time we made love
in the past four months.

42:57.533 --> 42:58.659
I just found out.

43:01.787 --> 43:03.914
Haven't even decided
to go through with it yet.

43:04.915 --> 43:07.543
It was hard enough before,
when I knew how you felt about me.

43:07.626 --> 43:10.087
-You do know how I feel--
-And if I decide not to,

43:10.170 --> 43:12.548
I won't have you
standing there judging me.

43:14.133 --> 43:17.052
This is something we wanted
more than anything.

43:17.886 --> 43:20.889
It's my decision to make,
and I'm gonna do it on my own.

43:24.018 --> 43:25.019
You should go.

43:35.529 --> 43:36.780
[door slams]

43:42.870 --> 43:46.707
[woman] So, the Tuscan villa,
the Whistler chalet

43:46.790 --> 43:48.917
and the Caribbean hideaway,

43:49.001 --> 43:50.836
three stunning properties

43:50.919 --> 43:55.424
all for the price of two or three
normal vacations.

43:59.678 --> 44:03.265
All right, I can tell
you need a little more motivation.

44:03.349 --> 44:07.269
I'll go see if my manager can knock
a few dollars off the purchase price.

44:07.353 --> 44:08.771
I'll be right back.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.280
[door lock clicks]

44:25.079 --> 44:28.415
[screams]
