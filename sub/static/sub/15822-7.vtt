01:01.085 --> 01:02.095
Help me!

01:02.734 --> 01:03.825
Somebody, help!

01:03.945 --> 01:06.940
- L.A.P.D.! Are you hit?!
- No, no, no! It's my friend!

01:07.060 --> 01:09.710
- He's over there.
- Come with me! Come with me!

01:13.327 --> 01:14.286
Oscar!

01:15.543 --> 01:16.942
Oscar, do not move!

01:17.318 --> 01:20.130
Oscar, you stupid son of a bitch.
What did you do?

01:20.250 --> 01:21.560
Can't get up.

01:23.331 --> 01:24.713
Julio, am I dying?

01:24.873 --> 01:25.605
No!

01:27.249 --> 01:28.533
He's okay, right?

01:34.790 --> 01:36.553
It's gonna be okay, Oscar.

01:36.673 --> 01:37.848
Tao? Tao,

01:38.395 --> 01:39.724
Tao, this is Sanchez.

01:39.844 --> 01:43.398
Look, I need you to send units to First
and Indiana. My brother's been shot.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.320
It's gonna be okay, Oscar.

01:51.762 --> 01:53.324
Julio, it hurts.

01:54.915 --> 01:56.642
We're over here! Come here!

01:56.762 --> 01:59.198
Hey! Come here! What the hell?!
Come here!

01:59.318 --> 02:02.414
You got to put pressure here and here!
You're gonna stop the bleeding, okay?

02:02.534 --> 02:04.126
Julio, don't leave me! Don't leave me!

02:04.246 --> 02:06.195
Be right back, Oscar.
I'll be right back.

02:06.315 --> 02:07.901
Oscar, it's gonna be OK.

02:08.020 --> 02:09.026
I got you.

02:09.145 --> 02:10.643
Hey! Hey! Hey!

02:11.002 --> 02:12.868
What the hell's the matter with you?!

02:12.988 --> 02:15.319
My brother's
bleeding to death over here!

02:15.439 --> 02:17.671
Hey, I'm a cop! I'm a cop!

02:20.962 --> 02:23.540
Sorry.
Got to be careful in this neighborhood.

02:23.660 --> 02:26.035
Can't help anybody
if we get shot at, too.

02:32.563 --> 02:33.587
1, 2, 3.

02:36.703 --> 02:38.401
- What's your name?
- Elena.

02:38.521 --> 02:40.902
- Elena Contreras.
- Okay, did you see what happened?

02:41.022 --> 02:43.287
We were just walking along,
and I saw a car drive away.

02:43.407 --> 02:44.709
What color? What kind?

02:44.869 --> 02:46.503
What? Blue, I think.

02:46.663 --> 02:48.494
Elena, look at me, look at me!

02:52.856 --> 02:53.802
Come here.

02:53.922 --> 02:56.971
Grab, casings on the curb and
on the grass. They look like 40-caliber.

02:57.131 --> 03:00.058
I want field interviews. You hit
every door, every single, one, OK?

03:00.218 --> 03:02.296
You see that girl right there?
She's a witness.

03:02.416 --> 03:05.287
Now, you make sure that she makes
it down to Parker Center. You got it?

03:05.407 --> 03:08.585
She makes it down there,
or I'm gonna come find you, Nelson!

03:15.692 --> 03:17.513
<i>Dr. Davis, telephone, please.</i>

03:18.236 --> 03:20.105
<i>Dr. Davis, telephone, please.</i>

03:26.035 --> 03:26.835
David?

03:27.116 --> 03:27.958
David!

03:28.302 --> 03:29.383
Any news?

03:32.062 --> 03:33.481
Oscar didn't make it.

03:34.721 --> 03:36.302
How's detective Sanchez?

03:37.153 --> 03:38.540
Julio, I mean Julio.

03:38.660 --> 03:41.391
I don't know. He's still in the E.R.
with the body.

03:41.658 --> 03:44.394
There's no budget restriction on this,
no limit on manpower.

03:44.554 --> 03:46.813
If this is an attack
on an L.A.P.D. officer's family,

03:46.973 --> 03:48.989
- we have no greater priority.
- OK, I understand.

03:49.109 --> 03:52.737
Well, I can check in with our
FBI task forces, guns, gangs, drugs...

03:52.857 --> 03:55.405
- See if they hear anything.
- That's great. Good idea. Thank you.

03:55.565 --> 03:58.083
Coordinate with commander Taylor.
He's ready to go.

03:58.203 --> 03:59.642
- Let's get this done.
- OK.

03:59.762 --> 04:00.869
- Chief?
- Yes?

04:01.029 --> 04:04.255
We got to hunt down whoever did this,
hunt them down.

04:08.942 --> 04:11.068
A lot of people! Hey, everybody.

04:11.188 --> 04:13.206
Lieutenant Provenza, even you're here.

04:13.326 --> 04:14.828
Thank you for coming down.

04:15.217 --> 04:18.303
Anything you need, you,
you know, just let us know.

04:18.463 --> 04:19.882
Are you hungry, sir?

04:20.173 --> 04:21.930
Did everybody get some pizza?

04:22.050 --> 04:25.056
Did you guys get some pizza?
Because I ordered plenty of pizza.

04:25.176 --> 04:27.531
So, please,
make sure that you get some, sir.

04:28.284 --> 04:29.204
I will.

04:30.243 --> 04:30.982
Tao.

04:31.256 --> 04:34.379
Hey, I'm really sorry about
screwing up your day off.

04:35.914 --> 04:38.104
- It's okay.
- We want to be here for you.

04:38.224 --> 04:41.532
Thank you, Kathy.
Chief, I'm really glad that you're here.

04:41.652 --> 04:43.571
I'm so sorry about this, Julio.

04:43.691 --> 04:46.164
Yeah, well,
we were kind of expecting it.

04:46.469 --> 04:48.899
I mean, I warned him
a million times to be careful.

04:49.019 --> 04:52.378
Probably looked at the wrong person
in the wrong place.

04:56.228 --> 04:59.566
Is there anyone that you'd like us
to call anyone from your family, or...

04:59.686 --> 05:01.686
No. Everybody's at work.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.170
And there's nothing they can do now.
Call them later.

05:05.623 --> 05:08.150
Okay, so, are you ready
to take my statement?

05:08.270 --> 05:10.087
I mean, I am a witness, Chief.

05:10.684 --> 05:14.157
I mean, I finally get to be
the witness who didn't see anything.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.605
We can do this later, Detective.

05:16.725 --> 05:20.086
No, no, every hour that passes, our
chances of catching the shooter go down.

05:20.206 --> 05:22.263
So, can we do this now? Okay?

05:23.768 --> 05:26.567
OK, the victim's name, Oscar Sanchez,19.

05:26.687 --> 05:28.444
Born, 7-21-89.

05:28.826 --> 05:30.750
Lived at 345 Denton.

05:30.910 --> 05:33.169
He was the youngest of 7 siblings.
Sergeant,

05:33.329 --> 05:36.139
do you want to write this down
or do you want me to?

05:36.743 --> 05:39.140
Okay, Oscar was not in a gang.

05:39.260 --> 05:41.604
But in our neighborhood,
if you hang out in the street for even

05:41.724 --> 05:44.088
two minutes, people think that you are.

05:44.208 --> 05:46.126
And I told him, "watch out."

05:47.467 --> 05:49.327
He was going to college in the fall.

05:49.447 --> 05:52.021
And he was a smart kid,
I mean, book smart.

05:52.691 --> 05:56.209
Are you sure there's nobody we can call
for you your father or your mother.

05:56.329 --> 05:58.403
- No, no, no, I'll do it later.
- Detective.

05:58.563 --> 05:59.483
Thank you.

05:59.897 --> 06:02.449
Listen,
there wasn't much of a crime scene.

06:02.569 --> 06:04.659
I heard shots. I took off running.

06:04.779 --> 06:07.987
I found Oscar. He was shot four times.
I counted six casings.

06:08.107 --> 06:10.578
Oh, and there was a name,
Elena Contreras.

06:10.698 --> 06:13.501
She was a witness.
She had my brother's hat.

06:14.782 --> 06:17.671
I tried to use it to
stop the bleeding, but

06:17.791 --> 06:20.529
I guess I didn't do a very good job,
aren't I, Chief?

06:20.974 --> 06:23.371
Would you like to book this
into evidence?

06:25.210 --> 06:27.362
Oh, all right. All right.

06:30.845 --> 06:31.657
Okay.

06:32.271 --> 06:33.774
- Do you got that?
- Yeah.

06:33.894 --> 06:34.722
Okay.

06:35.695 --> 06:39.388
Now, Julio, you have shown incredible
presence of mind through all this.

06:39.508 --> 06:43.228
- I started calling my gang contacts.
- Okay, hold on. Just one second.

06:45.175 --> 06:47.371
Now, I want you to do me a favor

06:47.491 --> 06:50.461
and let us concentrate on
this investigation while you take...

06:50.581 --> 06:52.314
- But you could use my help.
- Right now,

06:52.434 --> 06:54.227
your family needs you more than I do.

06:54.347 --> 06:57.036
I got to get back to Parker Center.
I got to interview the witness.

06:57.156 --> 06:59.786
Okay, I will handle that personally.
I promise.

07:02.196 --> 07:04.969
I want you to take some time off now,
all you need.

07:05.129 --> 07:07.932
And an L.A.P.D. counselor should...

07:09.601 --> 07:11.079
give you a hand.

07:11.804 --> 07:12.604
Now...

07:13.262 --> 07:15.773
If you need us for anything,
anything at all,

07:15.893 --> 07:17.716
you give us a call, okay?

07:19.357 --> 07:20.180
Okay.

07:25.146 --> 07:25.950
Okay.

07:39.464 --> 07:42.587
Kathy made a roast pork.
You want to come over for dinner?

07:42.995 --> 07:44.939
- Oh, I'll call you.
- Yeah.

07:45.185 --> 07:46.300
I'm so sorry.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.977
- I'm sorry, Detective.
- Thank you, sir.

07:57.515 --> 07:58.656
We'll get him.

08:12.173 --> 08:13.176
Elena...

08:14.226 --> 08:17.453
There must be something
that you remember about the shooting.

08:18.949 --> 08:19.674
No.

08:22.655 --> 08:24.858
We were... we were walking

08:25.259 --> 08:26.801
to his brother's house.

08:26.921 --> 08:28.790
Oscar was saying something about how

08:28.910 --> 08:31.227
he wanted me to meet his older brother.

08:32.556 --> 08:34.100
And then I don't know.

08:35.491 --> 08:37.371
So, you and Oscar were friends?

08:37.491 --> 08:39.145
Oscar was my boyfriend.

08:40.366 --> 08:42.943
- How long had you been dating?
- Three weeks.

08:43.063 --> 08:44.415
Almost a month.

08:45.644 --> 08:48.120
- So, you weren't that close.
- We were!

08:49.233 --> 08:50.572
He was good to me.

08:50.831 --> 08:53.170
Elena,
if you were really close to Oscar,

08:53.290 --> 08:56.345
if you really cared about him,
you'd stop holding back.

08:58.242 --> 09:01.295
Look, I need your help.
Oscar's family needs your help.

09:01.415 --> 09:04.547
I know that you're afraid,
but, please, help me.

09:05.197 --> 09:08.022
Please, just tell me what happened.

09:08.255 --> 09:09.175
Please.

09:16.420 --> 09:17.664
We were walking.

09:19.636 --> 09:20.386
And,

09:20.858 --> 09:22.089
all of a sudden,

09:22.802 --> 09:24.240
Oscar pushed me down.

09:25.296 --> 09:26.670
When I looked up,

09:27.007 --> 09:30.415
I saw this black guy lean out of the car
and start shooting.

09:30.535 --> 09:32.435
- The shooter was black?
- Yes.

09:33.078 --> 09:35.281
I saw the side of his face and his arm.

09:35.401 --> 09:38.572
Do you rember what car
he was driving or what color?

09:38.859 --> 09:40.764
I don't know. I was scared.

09:40.884 --> 09:43.498
I heard the shots. I saw Oscar fall.

09:43.618 --> 09:45.876
I don't know.
I just rember his arm and the gun.

09:45.996 --> 09:48.657
Did Oscar ever mention
that anyone was angry with him, or

09:48.777 --> 09:52.014
- had anyone ever tried to hurt him?
- I don't know why they shot him!

09:52.134 --> 09:54.970
I tried to help him! I really did try!

09:55.090 --> 09:56.899
I just didn't know what to do!

09:57.019 --> 09:57.683
OK.

09:58.828 --> 09:59.877
I'm sorry.

10:00.201 --> 10:01.821
That's enough for today.

10:02.087 --> 10:03.123
I'm sorry.

10:04.406 --> 10:05.987
Okay, thank you, Elena.

10:07.632 --> 10:11.025
Chief, what are you doing?
Why are you letting her go?

10:11.145 --> 10:12.878
I was gonna tell you,
he wouldn't let me.

10:12.998 --> 10:15.312
- He pulled the microphone.
- You let him watch the interview?

10:15.432 --> 10:17.163
Buzz did not let me. I made him.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.245
I told you to take some time off,
Detective!

10:19.365 --> 10:20.994
- I did.
- I meant days,

10:21.345 --> 10:22.297
not hours.

10:27.021 --> 10:28.744
Did you know he was here?

10:28.864 --> 10:30.174
I don't think so.

10:30.334 --> 10:33.412
Chief, why did you let Elena go?
She knows more than she's told you!

10:33.532 --> 10:35.612
She knows more than
she's ready to tell me right now.

10:35.732 --> 10:38.294
I will talk to her again
when I'll have a strategy in place.

10:38.414 --> 10:42.262
Well, then, you need to let me go out,
canvass the neighborhood or something.

10:42.382 --> 10:45.185
You are the victim's brother
and a witness.

10:45.455 --> 10:48.085
Oscar's murder might have been
an act of intimidation

10:48.205 --> 10:50.437
by one of the gangs
that you've investigated.

10:50.557 --> 10:53.239
This action could have been
targeted specifically at you.

10:53.399 --> 10:56.566
Well, then they missed it.
I should be the one to find them.

10:57.081 --> 10:59.245
We know how difficult this is for you,

10:59.365 --> 11:01.612
but you need to stay away from this case

11:01.732 --> 11:03.575
until I say otherwise.

11:03.988 --> 11:05.854
You think you know how to find this guy?

11:05.974 --> 11:07.759
I know how these gangs operate.

11:07.879 --> 11:09.302
I grew up there!

11:09.422 --> 11:11.376
I know everything
about the neighborhood!

11:11.496 --> 11:13.475
Everything? Then why
didn't you tell me that Oscar

11:13.595 --> 11:14.921
and Elena were dating?

11:15.439 --> 11:16.735
Did you know that?

11:19.884 --> 11:21.997
If you know who shot Oscar, tell me.

11:23.078 --> 11:25.022
If you don't, you must...

11:25.390 --> 11:29.734
must leave this investigation to those
who can pursue it with more objectivity.

11:30.011 --> 11:30.879
Julio...

11:32.182 --> 11:34.397
We will find who did this.

11:35.291 --> 11:36.587
Go home.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.953
That's a direct order, Detective.

11:41.390 --> 11:42.190
Fine.

12:09.885 --> 12:12.179
You know that Elena lied to you, right?

12:13.222 --> 12:14.278
Yes, I do.

12:15.006 --> 12:15.810
Okay.

12:16.963 --> 12:18.359
Good luck, everyone.

12:24.047 --> 12:24.847
So...

12:25.453 --> 12:27.591
Elena lied to us about what?

12:28.375 --> 12:29.658
I have no idea.

12:45.378 --> 12:48.021
Chief, maybe we can open up
an account at the Credit Union,

12:48.141 --> 12:50.497
some way for people to donate
money to Sanchez's family,

12:50.617 --> 12:52.806
maybe even a scholarship
in Oscar's name something.

12:52.926 --> 12:54.654
Thank you lt.
That's very thoughtful.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.154
There's nothing more
uplifting after a funeral

12:57.314 --> 13:00.783
than rounding up even more gang
members who will tell us nothing.

13:01.964 --> 13:05.385
- How many have we talked to?
- 117 in 3 days.

13:06.622 --> 13:08.962
- Detective Ross, anybody come forward?
- Come forward?

13:09.082 --> 13:11.308
People in that neighborhood
don't ever come forward, ma'am.

13:11.428 --> 13:12.889
You can't blame those gangs.

13:13.009 --> 13:15.260
If they think you talked to the cops,
they'll kill your dog.

13:15.380 --> 13:17.216
You talked to the cops,
they'll kill you.

13:17.376 --> 13:20.063
Intimidating locals is one thing, but
going after a police officer's family

13:20.183 --> 13:22.281
- That takes balls.
- If that's what happened.

13:24.873 --> 13:28.506
Anyone or anything interesting from
detective Sanchez's old cases?

13:28.626 --> 13:31.950
Well, fortunately,
most of them are dead or in jail.

13:32.070 --> 13:34.781
Now, we have been looking at
these six black gang members

13:34.901 --> 13:36.278
who just got out of prison.

13:36.398 --> 13:37.965
Don't even ask about the casings.

13:38.085 --> 13:41.447
Thousands of 40-caliber guns
in our system and not one hit,

13:41.567 --> 13:42.902
Not even close!

13:46.881 --> 13:49.373
For a murder that happened
in broad daylight in front of a witness,

13:49.533 --> 13:50.924
there are a lot of dead ends.

13:51.044 --> 13:53.198
Yeah, well, Sanchez
did say Elena was lying to us.

13:53.318 --> 13:55.215
They all lie, self-preservation.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.632
They don't want to be a snitch.
Maybe she knew the shooter.

13:57.752 --> 13:59.618
Maybe the guy Elena
told us about isn't black.

13:59.738 --> 14:01.818
- Maybe he's not even in a gang.
- Maybe,

14:02.173 --> 14:05.264
but she said what she said
on tape in our interview room.

14:05.424 --> 14:07.253
So, unless we follow up thoroughly,

14:07.373 --> 14:09.627
it's gonna come back and
bite us when we go to court.

14:09.747 --> 14:11.983
Detective Ross,
when you're done with your coffee,

14:12.103 --> 14:15.225
robbery homicide could help us
by turning over every stone,

14:15.345 --> 14:18.915
crip, and blood until the gangs
in this city know how serious we are.

14:19.035 --> 14:20.739
Even though
it's not getting us anywhere.

14:20.859 --> 14:22.984
We're already nowhere, Sergeant.

14:23.104 --> 14:26.131
It's hard to imagine
how things can get much worse.

14:26.692 --> 14:29.676
I don't think you should have said
that out loud, Chief.

14:31.700 --> 14:33.438
Could someone please
call commander Taylor

14:33.558 --> 14:35.340
and have him come down here right away?

14:35.625 --> 14:36.624
Ricardo.

14:41.019 --> 14:42.394
Juan Hernandez,

14:42.514 --> 14:44.828
Pedro Garza, David Olivera.

14:45.053 --> 14:48.782
These young men were murdered within
20 blocks of Oscar Sanchez, and yet,

14:48.902 --> 14:51.073
none of them being handled
by priority homicide division.

14:51.193 --> 14:53.634
I'm certain that robbery homicide
is doing everything we would.

14:53.754 --> 14:56.216
Yes, but you have five or six
detectives on every case,

14:56.336 --> 14:58.750
and robbery homicide averages,
what, maybe one and a half?

14:58.870 --> 15:01.169
To me, it seems like the only way
a murder case gets treated

15:01.289 --> 15:04.367
as a priority by the L.A.P.D. is if
you're rich, white, or related to a cop.

15:07.530 --> 15:10.251
Can I read the articles
about these murders?

15:10.371 --> 15:12.039
- Excuse me?
- Front page articles...

15:12.199 --> 15:13.916
Well, that's still a work in progress.

15:14.076 --> 15:16.722
The only way that a murder gets
treated like a priority at your paper

15:16.842 --> 15:20.389
is if it happens to someone rich
or white or related to a cop.

15:20.509 --> 15:22.756
- That's your response?
- No, it's a question.

15:22.876 --> 15:25.718
You can dodge it if you like.
You have the right to remain silent.

15:27.391 --> 15:28.714
Okay, here goes.

15:28.834 --> 15:31.847
Why is it, in a democracy,
where all people are created equal,

15:31.967 --> 15:34.562
some murders are treated like
a priority and others are not?

15:34.722 --> 15:37.398
People may be created equal,
but they don't die that way.

15:38.194 --> 15:39.348
Murder isn't fair.

15:39.468 --> 15:41.450
Then how do you determine
which killer is going...

15:41.570 --> 15:44.995
I don't assign myself cases! I take
orders from assistant chief Will Pope!

15:45.115 --> 15:47.972
And 9 times out of 10,
decisions he makes anticipate

15:48.092 --> 15:51.194
what's going to be splashed
across the front page of your paper.

15:53.282 --> 15:54.164
But...

15:56.006 --> 15:58.613
Let's just set that aside for a moment
and talk about these more

15:58.733 --> 16:01.132
- personally, shall we?
- Yes, please. Absolutely.

16:02.499 --> 16:04.388
My co-worker, my f...

16:06.628 --> 16:09.179
My friend's brother
was brutally murdered.

16:09.783 --> 16:11.820
That murder
could be connected to the work

16:11.940 --> 16:14.396
that detective Sanchez
does fighting gangs.

16:15.276 --> 16:17.533
Julio Sanchez's life might be in danger.

16:17.653 --> 16:19.991
That makes this case a huge priority,

16:20.111 --> 16:22.214
not only for me,
but for the entire department.

16:22.334 --> 16:24.217
Do you think that's wrong, Ricardo?

16:24.337 --> 16:26.502
Four days in, Chief, where are you
in this investigation,

16:26.622 --> 16:28.032
if it's such a priority?

16:30.175 --> 16:32.278
Chief John... son, you,

16:32.398 --> 16:35.150
You are still our liaison
to the press, are you not?

16:35.376 --> 16:37.971
- Right.
- Well, then, could you please liaise?

16:47.878 --> 16:49.053
May I help you?

16:49.213 --> 16:51.120
I want to talk to chief Johnson.

16:51.825 --> 16:53.432
I'm deputy chief Johnson.

16:54.261 --> 16:57.233
I have some information
on the murder of Oscar Sanchez.

16:59.998 --> 17:01.805
Miguel, who did this to you?

17:03.363 --> 17:05.122
Your face, the bruising?

17:05.434 --> 17:06.873
I slipped and fell.

17:07.630 --> 17:09.239
I'm a very clumsy person.

17:10.935 --> 17:13.423
Look, Miguel,
if you don't mind my asking,

17:13.542 --> 17:16.098
why did it take you
this long to come forward?

17:16.448 --> 17:17.522
I don't know.

17:19.685 --> 17:21.682
I was too scared to say anything.

17:23.133 --> 17:25.919
Nobody encouraged you
to come talk to me?

17:26.039 --> 17:28.759
Absolutely not.
I am here of my own violation.

17:30.546 --> 17:33.049
That means
it was my own idea to come here.

17:35.114 --> 17:37.184
OK, so, what do you want to tell me?

17:37.344 --> 17:39.478
Elena, the girl Oscar was with,

17:39.638 --> 17:42.459
she's my cousin, and everything
she said to you was a lie.

17:42.579 --> 17:44.365
How do you know
what Elena said to me?

17:46.699 --> 17:47.761
She told me?

17:48.884 --> 17:50.823
What exactly did Elena lie about?

17:51.097 --> 17:53.637
First of all, she told you
that she didn't see the car,

17:53.757 --> 17:55.788
but she told me she did
and that it was blue.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.637
She also didn't tell you that
she just broke up with a guy,

17:58.757 --> 18:00.335
a really bad guy.

18:00.455 --> 18:03.110
- What's his name?
- Everybody calls him "Puppet."

18:03.230 --> 18:04.841
- Puppet?
- He's in a gang.

18:04.961 --> 18:07.122
Do you know if he's a Blood or a Crip?

18:07.242 --> 18:09.958
What? No, no, those are black gangs.

18:10.078 --> 18:11.552
Puppet is not black.

18:11.712 --> 18:13.011
<i>He's an ESE, man. Come on.</i>

18:13.171 --> 18:16.647
I'll do a moniker check on Puppet, see
he turns up in our gang-tracking system.

18:16.767 --> 18:19.084
- Where would I find, Puppet?
- I don't know.

18:19.204 --> 18:20.151
I can't...

18:20.657 --> 18:22.855
All I know is his nickname, Puppet.

18:24.607 --> 18:27.004
- So, now you'll protect me, right?
- Protect you?

18:27.124 --> 18:28.482
Okay. From who?

18:29.298 --> 18:30.115
Well...

18:30.931 --> 18:32.030
Everyone.

18:42.350 --> 18:43.400
I love L.A.

18:45.207 --> 18:46.478
Why am I here, Sergeant?

18:46.598 --> 18:50.689
Well, believe it or not, Tao found
17 Puppets in our tracking system.

18:50.809 --> 18:54.578
But the one our witness identified
is in a gang called the Eastside 13.

18:54.831 --> 18:57.222
He was pulled over
at a traffic stop six weeks ago,

18:57.342 --> 18:59.031
and guess who was in the car with him.

18:59.151 --> 19:00.275
- Elena.
- Yep,

19:00.395 --> 19:03.290
and this is the last known
address for that particular Puppet.

19:03.410 --> 19:04.473
Thank you.

19:05.017 --> 19:06.235
Good afternoon.

19:06.481 --> 19:09.306
I'm looking for a young man.
I believe he's a friend of y'all's.

19:09.426 --> 19:11.122
His name is Puppet.

19:12.147 --> 19:13.113
Oh, yeah!

19:13.602 --> 19:14.949
This is nice!

19:15.636 --> 19:18.060
Hey, old man,
get the hell out of our pool.

19:19.401 --> 19:23.305
You know, this old man
happens to carry a big old gun.

19:23.750 --> 19:26.679
And when I get mad,
my hand shakes something awful,

19:26.799 --> 19:29.272
and I don't know
what the hell might happen.

19:29.392 --> 19:31.806
How long you had this little 12-footer?

19:31.926 --> 19:35.928
This ain't no 12-footer.
This here's a 16-foot Princecraft.

19:38.791 --> 19:39.511
What?

19:39.631 --> 19:41.945
There's a law in L.A. county
against having a boat longer

19:42.065 --> 19:43.483
than 12 feet in your front yard.

19:43.603 --> 19:45.936
Yeah, especially when the boat
is filled with water and morons.

19:46.056 --> 19:48.652
- Come on, man. That ain't no law.
- Oh, yeah, it is.

19:48.772 --> 19:51.401
And the fines are double
when the morons are on parole.

19:51.561 --> 19:53.240
So, unless you answer the questions,

19:53.360 --> 19:56.139
we're gonna tow this boat
and everybody in it away.

20:00.195 --> 20:01.732
Puppet moved, eh?

20:02.030 --> 20:04.122
- He's not gonna talk to you.
- How about an address?

20:04.282 --> 20:06.291
How about 217 North Alva street.

20:06.451 --> 20:08.771
Write it down this time.
I already told that other cop.

20:08.891 --> 20:11.321
- What other cop?
- I don't remember names.

20:21.946 --> 20:22.762
Chief.

20:23.008 --> 20:24.387
Sanchez's bike.

20:53.713 --> 20:55.007
Detective Sanchez!

20:55.167 --> 20:56.589
Put that lamp down!

20:57.899 --> 20:59.117
Don't worry, Chief.

20:59.237 --> 21:01.307
Puppet and I were just talking,
right, Puppet?

21:01.427 --> 21:03.305
Talking? Where is he?

21:04.582 --> 21:05.606
Down here.

21:06.798 --> 21:09.046
We'll take care of Mr. Puppet from here.

21:09.166 --> 21:12.341
- Keep him away from me.
- Put your hands up! Hands up!

21:12.851 --> 21:14.401
Hear that, Puppet?

21:14.561 --> 21:15.907
You're going down.

21:16.504 --> 21:17.968
And you're going Downtown,

21:18.088 --> 21:19.582
my office, one hour.

21:25.655 --> 21:28.021
You will head up a new division
of elite detectives

21:28.141 --> 21:30.975
"who will be responsible for the
highest-profile cases in Los Angeles."

21:31.095 --> 21:34.353
"It is my expectation that such
a squad, under the right leadership,"

21:34.473 --> 21:37.571
"will be able to eliminate
the recent string of scandals"

21:37.823 --> 21:40.469
"resulting from L.A.P.D. misconduct."

21:44.216 --> 21:47.394
That's the letter chief Pope sent to me
when he offered me the job.

21:47.736 --> 21:49.395
So, I am here to ensure

21:49.515 --> 21:52.749
that important cases are not
undermined by police misconduct.

21:52.998 --> 21:56.685
Do you have any idea what would happen
if chief Pope found out about this?

21:56.805 --> 21:58.013
Don't tell him.

21:58.381 --> 22:01.621
Did you threaten and coerce
Elena's cousin, Miguel Garza?

22:02.202 --> 22:02.927
Who?

22:04.105 --> 22:06.411
What about Puppet?
Did you use excessive force on him?

22:06.571 --> 22:08.948
Did he say
I used excessive force on him?

22:09.219 --> 22:11.869
Detective Sanchez, just because
your methods of intimidation

22:11.989 --> 22:13.404
are effective,

22:13.837 --> 22:17.047
- that does not make them legal.
- You never complained about it before.

22:18.786 --> 22:21.460
If I find that you violated
Puppet's civil rights...

22:21.580 --> 22:24.179
He killed my little brother.

22:24.299 --> 22:26.479
Can you prove that?
Did he confess to you?

22:26.599 --> 22:28.779
- Puppet's a gangster.
- Did he confess to you?!

22:28.899 --> 22:31.932
He's got a record!
He's Elena's ex, so he's got a motive!

22:32.052 --> 22:35.059
His car matches the description
of the one the witness identified to me,

22:35.179 --> 22:37.162
but which Elena lied to you about!

22:37.282 --> 22:40.534
She told me that the car was blue!
But you never knew that,

22:40.654 --> 22:42.570
because you kicked me
out of the building!

22:42.690 --> 22:45.330
I asked you to leave the building
because your presence could give

22:45.450 --> 22:48.430
a defense attorney grounds to throw out
all the evidence that we've discovered.

22:48.550 --> 22:51.547
You would not have any evidence
if it wasn't from me.

22:51.667 --> 22:53.959
- I found Puppet.
- You didn't find Puppet on your own.

22:54.119 --> 22:55.922
Someone here tipped you off.

22:56.193 --> 22:58.133
I don't suppose
you'd like to tell me who.

22:58.253 --> 22:59.381
I can't remember.

23:00.217 --> 23:02.864
We could have Oscar's murder
in custody right now,

23:02.984 --> 23:06.013
but your actions could make it
impossible to prosecute him!

23:06.173 --> 23:08.890
Do you want Puppet to get away
just because you attacked him?!

23:10.006 --> 23:13.603
Julio, please!
You've got to let me do my job! Please!

23:17.800 --> 23:20.527
I already recommended once
that you see a counselor,

23:20.687 --> 23:22.622
but now I'm ordering you to.

23:24.983 --> 23:26.533
Okay, just one more thing.

23:26.864 --> 23:29.166
Do you still have that picture
of Elena on your cellphone?

23:29.286 --> 23:31.372
I'd like to borrow it, please.

23:32.737 --> 23:34.916
I want to see how Puppet reacts to it.

23:40.604 --> 23:41.474
Go home.

23:42.181 --> 23:43.413
And stay home.

23:45.420 --> 23:47.932
Uh, excuse me.
This way, please, Julio.

24:23.983 --> 24:26.543
<i>Julio, let me call you back
in about 10 minutes.</i>

24:26.663 --> 24:28.839
How about we talk later, Lieutenant.

24:37.026 --> 24:40.108
I didn't shoot that cop's brother,
and I ain't in a gang no more.

24:40.228 --> 24:42.773
Puppet, please don't answer
questions I haven't asked yet.

24:42.893 --> 24:44.569
It just confuses me.

24:45.094 --> 24:46.200
Have a seat.

24:50.652 --> 24:52.410
Do you recognize this girl?

24:52.994 --> 24:53.703
No.

24:54.266 --> 24:55.933
See, now, I just find that annoying.

24:56.053 --> 24:57.855
First, you answer questions
I haven't asked,

24:57.975 --> 24:59.558
and when I do ask something, you lie.

24:59.678 --> 25:01.934
If you know I know,
then why are you asking?

25:02.054 --> 25:05.090
- Why did you and Elena break up?
- 'cause she's a stupid bitch.

25:06.835 --> 25:10.220
<i>She's very pretty. A girl like that
going out with another guy...</i>

25:10.380 --> 25:12.764
Don't tell me you weren't
just the tiniest bit jealous.

25:14.447 --> 25:16.948
Jealous of that bitch? She wishes.

25:17.068 --> 25:20.857
You'd only just broke up with her,
and already she was dating someone else.

25:20.977 --> 25:23.165
- Did she date while you were in prison?
- Dating?

25:23.285 --> 25:26.453
Elena was always dating someone.
That girl love to get dated.

25:26.573 --> 25:29.118
Oh, so, she cheated on you,
huh, Puppet?

25:29.238 --> 25:31.565
Look, I'm the one who dumped Elena,

25:31.685 --> 25:33.650
'cause she's a pain in my ass,
that's it.

25:33.770 --> 25:35.989
Then a couple weeks ago,
a punk-ass kid comes around.

25:36.109 --> 25:38.092
He's all like,
"stay away from Elena, man,"

25:38.212 --> 25:40.267
when all I did was pass by her
and laugh at her.

25:40.387 --> 25:41.376
Sit down.

25:43.381 --> 25:44.705
Sit down!

25:47.792 --> 25:50.288
You're talking about Oscar Sanchez, hmm?

25:50.408 --> 25:51.678
Oscar confronted you?

25:51.838 --> 25:53.515
He gets up all in my face for no reason.

25:53.635 --> 25:55.520
- I should have beat his ass.
- Why didn't you?

25:55.640 --> 25:56.354
Why?

25:57.223 --> 26:00.020
'cause his brother. I don't need
that kind of trouble. I'm on parole.

26:00.180 --> 26:02.151
You know that Julio Sanchez
is a detective?

26:02.390 --> 26:05.111
- Everyone knows Julio's a...
- Did he ever arrest anyone

26:05.231 --> 26:07.944
you cared about...
A family member or a friend?

26:09.442 --> 26:11.781
I don't know. Maybe. Why?

26:12.107 --> 26:14.451
- What kind of a car do you own?
- Why?

26:14.611 --> 26:16.499
I thought you just said
that you were on parole

26:16.619 --> 26:19.200
and didn't need any trouble.
I'll ask you again... What car?!

26:19.320 --> 26:21.708
- What color?!
- Honda Civic, blue... deep blue.

26:24.327 --> 26:26.817
You know, one of our witnesses reported

26:26.937 --> 26:30.617
that the shots that killed Oscar Sanchez
came from a blue car.

26:31.503 --> 26:34.971
Am I gonna find a 40-caliber handgun
when I search your house?

26:35.821 --> 26:37.470
No, that's bullshit.

26:37.590 --> 26:41.175
Is there someone who can confirm
your whereabouts last sunday afternoon?

26:41.295 --> 26:43.855
Your fellow east 13 gang members, maybe?

26:44.015 --> 26:45.705
I already told you I ain't in a gang.

26:45.825 --> 26:48.247
I don't care what that bitch Elena
told you. I didn't kill nobody.

26:48.367 --> 26:50.186
Your car matches the description.

26:50.306 --> 26:51.780
You seem angry at Oscar.

26:51.940 --> 26:54.322
That's what we bitches call motive.

26:54.442 --> 26:55.371
Motive?

26:55.777 --> 26:58.724
You know why people shoot people
in my neighborhood?

26:58.996 --> 27:01.581
'cause it's tuesday,
'cause it's too hot,

27:01.741 --> 27:03.709
'cause you look at them funny.

27:04.670 --> 27:07.715
<i>Chief, I'm sorry to interrupt,
but lt Flynn said someone showed up</i>

27:07.835 --> 27:10.162
<i>with some new evidence, and it's urgent.</i>

27:13.606 --> 27:16.215
- No, wait, are we done here?
- No, no, no.

27:16.487 --> 27:17.865
Not by a long shot.

27:25.191 --> 27:27.566
- Excuse me, Chief.
- Not now. Lieutenant.

27:28.618 --> 27:30.376
He's waiting in your office.

27:38.134 --> 27:40.310
- Are you chief Johnson?
- Oh, Lord.

27:40.430 --> 27:42.430
Did detective Sanchez
ask you to come here?

27:42.550 --> 27:44.823
Wait, wait, wait. Don't answer that.

27:45.150 --> 27:47.343
Brenda, have you met agent Mara?

27:48.595 --> 27:51.298
- Agent Mara?
- Agent Mara, ATF.

27:51.622 --> 27:54.396
I asked around, and agent Mara thinks
he may have found your gun.

27:54.516 --> 27:56.528
I'm living undercover in east L.A.

27:56.648 --> 27:58.565
We're in the middle
of a two-year investigation.

27:58.685 --> 28:01.266
I'm buying guns off the street
and tracking where they're coming from.

28:01.386 --> 28:03.515
If anybody finds out I'm ATF,
the whole thing's blown.

28:03.635 --> 28:06.118
No, that's cool.
Just tell her what you told me.

28:06.238 --> 28:08.057
After agent Howard
told me what happened,

28:08.177 --> 28:10.359
I put the word on the street
I was looking for a 40.

28:10.479 --> 28:12.824
Right away, this latino dude
sets up a meeting,

28:12.944 --> 28:14.873
just, like, itching to sell me one.

28:14.993 --> 28:17.949
So I make him this real lowball offer,
and he jumps at it.

28:18.109 --> 28:20.952
Then he tells me to be extra careful
who I sell the weapon to.

28:21.112 --> 28:23.679
It's like he might as well have just
etched "dirty gun" on the handle.

28:23.799 --> 28:25.818
- Can I see it?
- I already dropped it off

28:25.938 --> 28:28.585
with an L.A.P.D. weapons analyst.
He's looking it over now.

28:28.745 --> 28:30.595
But I'm telling you,
that's gonna be your gun.

28:30.715 --> 28:32.598
Does this seller have a name?

28:32.718 --> 28:35.258
Ask for names, they know you're a cop.
He was, like...

28:36.294 --> 28:38.219
- a weird-looking guy.
- Like a puppet?

28:38.379 --> 28:39.455
Like a what?

28:39.781 --> 28:41.884
Would you mind following me
just for a moment?

28:42.004 --> 28:43.660
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

28:47.793 --> 28:50.273
- Your gun seller... was he in a gang?
- He had a lot of ink.

28:50.433 --> 28:52.901
I didn't really get a good look at it,
during the deal and all.

28:53.061 --> 28:54.672
But he did say he was on parole,

28:54.792 --> 28:56.686
which I think was like,
supposed to impress me

28:56.806 --> 28:58.204
- or scare me.
- This way.

28:58.324 --> 29:00.959
Lt Tao, would you join us
for a moment, please?

29:01.079 --> 29:03.125
Right in here. To the left.

29:08.310 --> 29:10.485
Is this the guy who sold you the gun?

29:12.247 --> 29:14.348
- I can't tell.
- Buzz, could you please

29:14.468 --> 29:16.749
- go knock on the door?
- Yes, ma'am.

29:19.879 --> 29:23.457
Lieutenant Tao, please head over
to firearms analysis and stay there

29:23.577 --> 29:26.482
until we get complete results
on the weapon they're testing for us.

29:26.602 --> 29:28.944
Oh, that... that could take
till tomorrow morning.

29:29.064 --> 29:30.271
Yes, it could.

29:33.439 --> 29:34.980
No, that ain't him.

29:36.050 --> 29:37.883
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

29:39.153 --> 29:41.408
But you're right.
He does kind of look like a puppet.

29:45.911 --> 29:49.707
So, I had corrections department
compile a list

29:49.867 --> 29:53.016
of all the guys who got out on parole
in L.A. in the last three months.

29:53.136 --> 29:55.952
Agent Mara's been going over the photos.
He recognized this guy.

29:56.072 --> 29:58.508
Juan Guzman, a.k.a. "Gooz."

29:58.889 --> 30:01.376
- Any connection to detective Sanchez?
- Uh, no, Chief.

30:01.496 --> 30:03.424
He was actually arrested
by a deputy sheriff.

30:03.544 --> 30:05.636
He just got out a month ago
after serving eight years.

30:05.756 --> 30:08.240
- Eight years for what?
- Drive-by shooting.

30:08.512 --> 30:10.732
- Commander, pick him up.
- I'm going with you.

30:10.852 --> 30:13.850
Wait, whoa, whoa. Hey, we promised
agent Mara we'd protect his cover.

30:13.970 --> 30:17.276
You can't go pick up this Gooz
for selling him that gun.

30:18.871 --> 30:22.365
I'll call his parole officer. We can
conduct a random parole search anytime.

30:22.525 --> 30:24.454
What if he doesn't find anything?

30:24.574 --> 30:25.887
Look at this guy.

30:26.404 --> 30:27.863
We'll find something.

30:34.824 --> 30:37.096
My son hasn't done anything wrong!

30:37.216 --> 30:40.189
Mrs. Guzman, we have every right
to ask him questions.

30:40.309 --> 30:42.527
But you can't take Juan away from me!

30:42.647 --> 30:44.521
Listen, your son's gonna be here
for a while,

30:44.641 --> 30:46.780
so take your other boy downstairs
and get a bite to eat.

30:46.900 --> 30:48.538
I promise we'll be in contact with you.

30:48.658 --> 30:51.003
No. No, I will not leave him here.

30:51.123 --> 30:53.354
Let her wait if she wants to.
She's probably used to it.

30:53.514 --> 30:55.798
All right, suit yourself.
Have a seat.

30:56.704 --> 30:58.281
<i>Dale. Siénta te.</i>

31:03.773 --> 31:06.909
Hey, Chief, guess what Gooz
keeps in his sock drawer...

31:07.029 --> 31:09.121
A box of 40-caliber ammunition.

31:09.241 --> 31:11.640
Same casings as we got
at the crime scene.

31:11.760 --> 31:13.854
- Told you we'd find something.
- He's in interview 1.

31:13.974 --> 31:16.482
And I just thought you might like
to know that Gooz's mom

31:16.602 --> 31:18.786
- owns a blue Chevy Impala.
- Thank you.

31:18.906 --> 31:20.979
Okay, sergeant Gabriel,
please pick up Elena.

31:21.099 --> 31:23.317
Let's see if she's ready
to give us a more truthful I.D.

31:23.437 --> 31:25.940
- And bring her up the back way, please.
- You got it, Chief.

31:26.060 --> 31:27.985
- Keep me posted.
- Absolutely.

31:28.105 --> 31:29.647
The gun agent Mara brought in...

31:29.767 --> 31:32.626
We confirmed it as the weapon
that killed Oscar.

31:32.746 --> 31:33.478
Good.

31:33.985 --> 31:34.747
Chief,

31:35.608 --> 31:38.852
I was just trying to show Julio
we were making progress.

31:39.741 --> 31:41.862
I know I didn't do it by the book.

31:43.058 --> 31:45.106
But the book doesn't cover this.

31:45.775 --> 31:46.950
And I'm his friend.

31:47.378 --> 31:50.787
And what do you suppose Julio is to me,
Lieutenant? An employee?

31:51.547 --> 31:53.477
Did you ever, for a moment, consider

31:53.597 --> 31:56.293
that I might be trying to keep
detective Sanchez from doing irreparable

31:56.413 --> 31:57.794
damage to his career?

31:59.247 --> 32:01.798
You are aware, are you not,
that our friend has a temper?

32:02.166 --> 32:02.927
I am.

32:04.921 --> 32:06.302
I'm sorry, Chief.

32:06.462 --> 32:09.163
I'm just trying to find a way
to help him.

32:09.906 --> 32:12.290
And I just don't know what to do.

32:13.306 --> 32:15.118
Your job, Lieutenant.

32:15.916 --> 32:18.327
It's what Julio needs
from all of us right now.

32:18.447 --> 32:20.284
Now, the guy who has the gun

32:20.404 --> 32:24.072
you just confirmed as the murder weapon
is sitting in interview room 1.

32:24.192 --> 32:27.257
I think detective Sanchez would like
to be present for this interview.

32:27.377 --> 32:30.428
- I'll be ready in about 20 minutes.
- Thank you, Chief.

32:38.095 --> 32:40.336
Now, why would you have
a box of ammunition, Mr. Guzman?

32:40.496 --> 32:43.214
That ain't mine.
I ain't never seen it before.

32:44.341 --> 32:47.702
You understand this is a pretty serious
violation of your parole.

32:47.822 --> 32:49.779
- So?
- I'm guessing that you're looking

32:49.899 --> 32:51.991
at least another year in prison.

32:52.625 --> 32:54.872
Look, I already did eight years.

32:55.271 --> 32:57.464
I can do another one
standing on my head.

32:57.584 --> 32:59.259
Well, maybe you don't have to.

32:59.379 --> 33:02.025
<i>If you cooperate with me today
and answer some of my questions,</i>

33:02.628 --> 33:04.721
<i>maybe we can work something out.</i>

33:04.841 --> 33:06.404
Okay, lady. Shoot.

33:07.223 --> 33:09.907
You ask me a question,
and I'll cooperate.

33:11.989 --> 33:14.912
Where's the gun
that goes with this ammunition?

33:15.905 --> 33:19.168
Well, since I ain't never seen
that box of bullets before,

33:19.288 --> 33:22.211
I guess that means
I don't know nothing about no gun.

33:23.174 --> 33:24.244
Is that all?

33:24.897 --> 33:26.945
Can we work something out now?

33:30.734 --> 33:32.619
You recognize this young man?

33:35.700 --> 33:36.443
Nope.

33:37.060 --> 33:39.312
<i>Chief, sergeant Gabriel's here
with the witness.</i>

33:42.150 --> 33:44.067
You'll have to excuse me for a moment.

33:45.102 --> 33:46.110
Take your time.

33:54.023 --> 33:54.911
Elena...

33:55.255 --> 33:57.372
Thank you so much for coming back in.

33:57.532 --> 33:59.248
He didn't give me much of a choice.

33:59.757 --> 34:02.277
We all know
that the last time you were here,

34:02.397 --> 34:04.587
you didn't exactly
tell us the truth.

34:04.747 --> 34:06.880
That's all right.
Don't worry. I understand.

34:07.000 --> 34:10.009
You didn't want to make yourself
the next target. But...

34:10.168 --> 34:12.426
the only way that we can keep you safe

34:12.545 --> 34:15.598
is if we find the man who shot Oscar
and get him off the streets.

34:16.937 --> 34:19.167
Now, I'm gonna show you someone
in a minute,

34:19.286 --> 34:21.668
but I don't want you to worry,
because he can't see you

34:21.788 --> 34:23.147
and he's in a locked room.

34:23.306 --> 34:26.661
But the only way to keep him there
is if you tell us the truth.

34:27.143 --> 34:27.877
Okay?

34:30.313 --> 34:31.030
Okay.

34:36.288 --> 34:38.036
- No, I don't know him.
- Take your time.

34:38.197 --> 34:41.121
- I want you to be sure.
- I'm sure. I don't remember that guy.

34:41.241 --> 34:43.125
- He looks scary...
- Look again, Elena!

34:43.245 --> 34:44.956
I'm telling you, that's not him.

34:45.076 --> 34:48.303
- You look again!
- All right, that's okay. That's okay.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.259
You can go now, Elena.
Thank you so much for your help.

34:51.379 --> 34:53.779
Chief, this girl lied to you before.

34:53.899 --> 34:55.791
She said the killer was black,
and he wasn't.

34:55.911 --> 34:58.166
She said she did not see the car,
and she did.

34:58.286 --> 35:00.650
And she says she doesn't recognize
this guy, but she does!

35:00.770 --> 35:02.937
Okay, that is enough, Detective!

35:09.786 --> 35:12.550
You just got me killed!
You said he wouldn't see me,

35:12.670 --> 35:15.112
- but he just saw me! Now I'm dead!
- Calm down! Calm down!

35:15.232 --> 35:17.178
He's behind closed doors
in a locked room.

35:17.298 --> 35:20.133
No, he's not! He's right there,
and he just saw me!

35:20.253 --> 35:22.127
He's sitting right there!

35:42.229 --> 35:42.990
Okay.

35:43.638 --> 35:46.452
Mirandized the kid,
but maybe we don't need a confession.

35:46.572 --> 35:49.269
- We have the I.D. from the girl.
- No, Elena's described the killer

35:49.389 --> 35:52.291
so many different ways. A prosecutor'd
have trouble putting her on the stand.

35:52.411 --> 35:54.034
I wouldn't count on Elena repeating

35:54.154 --> 35:55.985
anything she said to us
in the courtroom.

35:56.105 --> 35:58.234
Chief, let me question the kid.

35:58.354 --> 36:02.003
- I know how to make him talk.
- That's not necessary, Detective.

36:04.378 --> 36:05.465
Excuse me.

36:12.917 --> 36:15.744
Hello, Tony.
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

36:18.083 --> 36:20.235
- You don't have nothing on me.
- I know. I know.

36:20.355 --> 36:22.730
Our witness got it wrong.
She must have seen you

36:22.850 --> 36:25.728
standing behind your brother, Juan,
when he shot the victim.

36:26.460 --> 36:29.143
Anyway, we all know
that you're much too little.

36:29.263 --> 36:31.245
And Juan's already confessed.

36:32.134 --> 36:34.744
But look, this is really serious, Tony,

36:35.233 --> 36:38.866
because if you knew that your brother
was going to shoot Oscar Sanchez

36:39.026 --> 36:41.953
before he pulled the trigger,
that makes you an accomplice.

36:42.113 --> 36:43.067
Oscar who?

36:44.861 --> 36:47.163
<i>You didn't know the young man
your brother murdered?</i>

36:47.283 --> 36:50.239
- <i>Juan never told me he murdered anyone.
- Yes, he did.</i>

36:50.359 --> 36:53.548
<i>When the witness identified you, by
mistake, Juan told us the whole truth.</i>

36:53.708 --> 36:56.701
In fact he's on his way to the courtroom
right now to get arraigned.

36:56.821 --> 36:58.702
My brother didn't shoot nobody.

36:58.822 --> 37:01.781
Juan was just driving the car around
while we were looking for an East 18.

37:01.901 --> 37:03.956
One of them snitched
on my brother in prison.

37:04.076 --> 37:08.019
Okay, okay. Who is this guy
from the East 18? What was his name?

37:08.139 --> 37:11.360
Hell, we didn't know that.
We were looking for any East 18.

37:11.480 --> 37:14.052
Those chicken-shit punks must have been
hiding or something.

37:14.172 --> 37:16.445
We drove around all day, and nothing.

37:17.098 --> 37:19.282
And what were you gonna do
if you found an East 18?

37:20.017 --> 37:21.701
Gonna mess him up real bad.

37:22.138 --> 37:23.824
But you didn't find one.

37:24.697 --> 37:28.084
Look, look,
Tony, this story's really unbelievable.

37:28.204 --> 37:29.959
- And Juan has already told...
- Okay.

37:31.002 --> 37:33.671
Look...
here's exactly what happened.

37:34.536 --> 37:37.635
We saw this smoking-hot chick
walking along with some guy.

37:37.755 --> 37:40.958
And it was kind of East 18 territory,
and he was wearing this white-and-green

37:41.078 --> 37:43.090
- baseball hat, so...
- Do East 18...

37:43.210 --> 37:45.337
- usually wear white-and-green hats?
- No,

37:45.457 --> 37:47.440
they wear lots of orange.

37:48.111 --> 37:51.439
But lots of times, they'll write an 18
under the bill of their hats.

37:51.599 --> 37:53.691
That's weak, you know,
hiding their signs.

37:53.851 --> 37:56.642
So, you thought
this guy you saw might...

37:56.762 --> 37:58.487
have written 18 on the bill of his hat.

37:58.647 --> 37:59.435
Yeah.

37:59.747 --> 38:02.455
So, my brother stops the car
and gives me his gun, and says,

38:02.575 --> 38:03.863
"go hit him up."

38:03.983 --> 38:07.655
<i>"Hit him up"? That means,
"what neighborhood are you from?"</i>

38:07.945 --> 38:10.101
<i>Yeah, but suddenly this guy steps to me</i>

38:10.221 --> 38:13.634
<i>like he's trying to show off
for his girl, and just like, laughs.</i>

38:13.754 --> 38:15.872
<i>So, I walk up to him.
I hit him up again.</i>

38:15.992 --> 38:18.897
"Hey, fool, where you from?"
And he's like, "I'm not from anywhere."

38:19.017 --> 38:21.629
But I seen the hat, and I knew
he was rolling in the wrong street.

38:21.749 --> 38:23.985
So, I say, "I'm not playing, man.
Where you from?"

38:24.105 --> 38:26.450
"Let me see that hat. Show me that hat."

38:28.136 --> 38:31.723
He just laughs and tells me
to go home to my mom.

38:32.831 --> 38:35.138
- So, what did you say?
- Nothing.

38:37.945 --> 38:39.073
I shot him.

38:48.000 --> 38:51.304
So, just to be clear,
you shot Oscar Sanchez

38:51.424 --> 38:53.668
- because he wouldn't show you his hat?
- Hey,

38:53.788 --> 38:55.293
I asked him, like, three times

38:55.413 --> 38:57.822
<i>for him to show me that hat.
And he just laughs?</i>

38:57.942 --> 39:01.801
<i>You think I'm gonna take that crap with
my brother watching me from the car?</i>

39:02.420 --> 39:03.127
Man.

39:07.210 --> 39:10.219
Well, here it is, Tony...
Oscar Sanchez's hat...

39:10.763 --> 39:13.391
the one you murdered him to see.
Look at it.

39:13.682 --> 39:14.730
Look at it!

39:16.963 --> 39:19.283
No markings. No numbers.

39:19.573 --> 39:21.494
No orange. Just blood.

39:25.653 --> 39:28.119
I guess he should have showed it to me,
huh?

39:29.016 --> 39:30.496
How old are you, Tony?

39:32.769 --> 39:33.666
Fourteen.

39:34.709 --> 39:36.752
I'm gonna be fifteen next month.

39:38.154 --> 39:41.218
Well...
Since you want to be an adult so badly,

39:42.087 --> 39:44.169
maybe we ought to trial you as one.

39:46.818 --> 39:50.266
Oh, and by the way,
since your brother was driving the car,

39:50.426 --> 39:52.783
helping you hunt for a victim,

39:53.399 --> 39:54.523
under the law,

39:55.031 --> 39:57.079
- he's every bit as guilty as you are.
- No,

39:57.199 --> 40:00.242
- look, look, that ain't fair! Okay?!
- No, it isn't.

40:57.242 --> 40:58.751
It's... it's my fault.

41:00.848 --> 41:02.588
- Don't say that.
- No.

41:04.346 --> 41:05.307
It's true.

41:06.104 --> 41:07.337
It's my fault.

41:10.617 --> 41:11.922
Julio, you...

41:13.046 --> 41:15.767
you almost saved
your little brother's life.

41:15.887 --> 41:17.815
What else could you have done?

41:18.451 --> 41:21.713
Oscar died, sir,
'cause he was wearing this hat.

41:28.004 --> 41:29.925
How is that... your fault?

41:37.830 --> 41:40.041
I gave him this hat for his, uh...

41:40.585 --> 41:42.507
for his birthday last month.

41:42.627 --> 41:45.698
I gave him this hat!
I gave it to him! I did!

41:48.345 --> 41:50.701
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

41:53.329 --> 41:55.891
I'm sorry, sir! I'm sorry!

42:01.098 --> 42:02.000
Oscar!

42:02.454 --> 42:04.809
<i>Oscar, I'm sorry!</i>

42:05.757 --> 42:09.400
I'm sorry, Oscar! I'm sorry!

42:12.483 --> 42:15.077
It's my fault! It's my fault!
