WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:08.000
All right, who wants to go first?

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000
Britannia is a cursed land...

00:13.000 --> 00:15.000
...ruled by the dead.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.000
In a few hours' time,

00:20.000 --> 00:25.000
20,000 men...
will set sail to Britannia.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
You've come to occupy us?

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
We've come to work with you.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
You don't defeat these people
by fighting their warriors...

00:39.000 --> 00:41.000
..you defeat them
by fighting their gods.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.000
Are you threatening the Druids?

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
Guards of Britannia, I am Rome...

00:54.000 --> 00:57.000
..and where I walk is Rome.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.000
We don't need you.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
We don't want you.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
You will stand down your army.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
-Go!
-No!

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
You can lick my crack.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
What's a Roman?

01:22.000 --> 01:26.000
The Romans are devils.
They're the foot soldiers of Lokka...

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
..the Great Earth Demon.

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Well, that sounds scary, doesn't it?

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
-So, what's the mission?
-Isn't it obvious?

01:39.000 --> 01:44.000
Stop the Romans, send them home,
kill the General.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Such a stupid question!

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Fire!

01:53.000 --> 01:55.000
Mighty Lokka...

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
Forward!

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
We are rising.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
Do you have any idea...

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
..the power you're up against?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Come and get me, you fucking snake!

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
Take them!

02:29.000 --> 02:33.000
Gods don't deal, Rome.
The gods don't deal.

02:40.000 --> 02:42.000
It is her.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
Hope is the daughter
of a blind father.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
It turns out, you're not a pointless
little pain in the arse.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000
It seems I was wro... wr... wr...
I was wro...

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
You were wr... wrong.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
-Just shut your mouth.
-Thank you.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Out of my way! Move.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.000
-Is he dead yet?
-Still going. He's drawing a crowd.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Well, I don't know about you,
but I'm starving.

04:57.000 --> 05:00.000
Let's stick one in him,
have an early supper?

05:00.000 --> 05:03.000
Death by crucifixion.
It's in the orders.

05:05.000 --> 05:09.000
-What about my orders?
-That happened first

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
-What did?
-We agreed.

05:10.000 --> 05:13.000
Whoever was first
wouldn't be a prick.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
Yeah. Come on...

05:23.000 --> 05:25.000
..do the poor lad a favor.

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
All right.

05:37.000 --> 05:43.000
Why are you people still here?
Nothing to see here. Bugger off!

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
When I look out my window

06:37.000 --> 06:39.000
Many sights to see

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
And when I look in my window

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
So many different people to be

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Oh, no

06:53.000 --> 06:58.000
Must be the season of the witch

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
Must be the season of the witch, yeah

07:03.000 --> 07:06.000
Must be the season of the witch

07:14.000 --> 07:18.000
You got to pick up every stitch

07:19.000 --> 07:23.000
The rabbits running in the ditch

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
Beatnicks are out to make it rich

07:29.000 --> 07:35.000
Oh, no
Must be the season of the witch

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
Do you like what I've done
with the place?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
All local stone.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.000
The best part is I can come in here,
lie back

07:58.000 --> 08:01.000
and the outside world
just disappears.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.000
-I do love a bath.
-This was a sacred place.

08:06.000 --> 08:10.000
These waters are warmed
by mighty Sulis.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.000
Well, he's doing an excellent job.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
This is a blessed day, Chieftains.

08:17.000 --> 08:21.000
This day our emperor, your emperor,
is visiting this province.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.000
Now, I'm sure I can trust you all...

08:23.000 --> 08:27.000
Before we discuss your emperor,
we have grievances to air.

08:27.000 --> 08:31.000
-Important grievances.
-Of course you do.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
I can smell the old bitch from here.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.000
-I'm Queen Amena of the...
-We know who you are.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.000
What do you want?

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
To pay respects to your mother,
the queen.

09:30.000 --> 09:34.000
My mother loathed the Cantii.
You the worst.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
A moon has passed,
yet still she lies unburied.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.000
-We await the Druids.
-Then you clearly haven't heard.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
The Druids have abandoned us.

09:46.000 --> 09:49.000
-Vanished. Scattered to the winds.
-Liar.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
-I told you...
-Shut your mouth!

09:53.000 --> 09:54.000
If I'm wrong, where are they?

09:54.000 --> 09:57.000
Why would Queen Amena
speak ill of the Druids?

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Is it because the gods wouldn't,
in a thousand moons

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
put a crown upon her head.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.000
And if they didn't, who did?

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
A Roman devil.

10:16.000 --> 10:22.000
Twenty-feet tall, spitting fire,
with a big scaly dick.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
You get a herring each...

10:29.000 --> 10:31.000
..and then you leave.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
It starts with taxes, then day
by day, they'll bleed you white.

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
It's true, the Romans tax.
But it's agreed.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.000
Negotiated according to trade.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.000
Let them come.
Their heads will decorate our ramparts.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.000
Derog... No!

10:50.000 --> 10:54.000
-Listening to a Roman whore.
-This is about our future.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Fuck the future.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.000
She's good on her back, this one,
and nothing more.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Now eat your fish and go.
Your lies are turning my stomach.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
Never easy, brothers.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
-I am my brother's equal.
-Would the Druids agree?

11:19.000 --> 11:22.000
When the time comes? Which it won't,
because they're not coming.

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
The problem here
isn't who sticks mom in the sea.

11:27.000 --> 11:31.000
It's what happens next.
To you, your tribe...

11:31.000 --> 11:33.000
Who would you have decide that?
A god?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
A Druid? Or you?

11:38.000 --> 11:41.000
Who is going to be king, Halwyn?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
-That is for the gods to...
-Halwyn...

11:44.000 --> 11:46.000
Who is going to be king?

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
Three families were killed
by your soldiers.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
They were trying
to worship our god, Taranis.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
I'm glad you bring it up.

11:59.000 --> 12:02.000
Stopping such mix-ups
is why I've invited you all here.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.000
-These are our lands, our gods.
-But you are part of the empire now.

12:07.000 --> 12:10.000
We want you to be free to worship
your gods in any way you choose.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
All we ask is you call them
something we recognize, a Roman name.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
But the names of the gods are sacred.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.000
-What's your wife's name?
-He has five wives.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.000
-One will do.
-Vanna.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Vanna. So, Vanna comes home one night

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
and she says from now on,
she wants to be called Dudunda.

12:29.000 --> 12:32.000
She still looks like Vanna,
talks like Vanna,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
she's still warming your bed.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
This Taranis of yours,
is the king of the gods.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Well, our king of the gods
is Jupiter.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
How many arms does this Jupiter have?

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
Taranis has eight and six cocks.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
How about Vulcan? He's quite a sight.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.000
Fierce, lots of arms.
He'd be a match for Taranis.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.000
-Does he have six cocks
-Wait. Stop, stop!

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Are you pissing in my bath?

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
-No.
-You are. You are doing that face.

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
-I'm not.
-Nobody...

13:07.000 --> 13:10.000
...pisses in my bath.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.000
-Nobody.
-I swear by Taranis.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
Oh, I think you mean Vulcan.

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
I swear by Vulcan.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
There. That wasn't so hard, was it?

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Forgive me, Mother.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
You fool.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
King Halwyn...

14:46.000 --> 14:48.000
Welcome to the future.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Come on, lads.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.000
General?

15:51.000 --> 15:56.000
We won't find the girl this way.
We need to widen the net.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.000
General, the emperor's caravan
approaches.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
Thank you, Decanus.

16:02.000 --> 16:05.000
Go to the villages,
every settlement in the territory.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
Knock on doors.

16:07.000 --> 16:10.000
-What shall I do with the captives?
-Get rid of them.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.000
-Queen Amena.
-Perfectis.

16:12.000 --> 16:15.000
I want 100 horsemen
ready by nightfall.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
Aye, General.

16:20.000 --> 16:22.000
-You have a new ally.
-Defed...

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
Derog. Derog of the Demetae.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Halwyn of the Demetae.

16:27.000 --> 16:31.000
-Isn't he the stupid brother?
-Well, now he's the useful brother.

16:31.000 --> 16:35.000
-I thought we were going for Derog.
-Derog wasn't king material.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.000
-Derog's a warrior. A legend.
-Derog's dead.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.000
Oh, that does tip things
in Halwyn's favor.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
I'm sure he'll do an excellent job.

16:46.000 --> 16:50.000
-A hundred horsemen.
-Excuse me?

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
I couldn't help overhearing. Exciting.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.000
Is there something afoot?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
Now, now. Just because
we share a bed...

17:02.000 --> 17:04.000
I wasn't prying.

17:04.000 --> 17:08.000
I just feel as your ally,
has someone upset you?

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
Are you going to ride in
and burn their village?

17:13.000 --> 17:14.000
Who, me?

17:16.000 --> 17:19.000
You misunderstand me, Your Majesty.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
I'm looking for something.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
Something that belongs to me.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
Something I want very, very badly.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.000
And what do you want very, very badly?

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
I'll tell you what
I don't want right now.

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
Emperor Claudius, welcome to Britannia.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
I trust your journey
was a pleasant one.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
The whole country's a toilet.
Where's your physician?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
-Physician, my Lord?
-Yes, man. A doctor.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
Is my Emperor unwell?

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
Comfy, they said, fit for a god.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
That fat beast's got a backbone
like a battering ram.

18:51.000 --> 18:55.000
I've been on it for five-fuck-arse
minutes, I've got the shakes,

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
the voices, my head is on fire,
and I've got piles to my fucking ankles.

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
Commander, a physician. Now!

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
Fucking Jupiter!

19:03.000 --> 19:06.000
-Take care, would you?
-I'm doing my best.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
So, come on. What have I missed?

19:10.000 --> 19:13.000
All Cantii and Iceni lands are pacified.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.000
Rebels fled north, the Ninth pursued
and annexed any sympathetic tribes.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.000
My apologies, Caesar.

19:19.000 --> 19:23.000
Our control of Britannia
now stretches from the southern coast

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
to Lindum Colonia in the north,
to the mountains.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.000
-Meanwhile the Atrebates...
-Fucking...

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
I tell you this arse is shot.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.000
I'm thinking of closing it
and opening a new one nearby.

19:37.000 --> 19:42.000
A thousand miles.
Province after dull fucking province.

19:42.000 --> 19:45.000
Little did I know,
I'd swap them all for this place.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.000
In the pantheon of "Right Shit Holes",
Britannia is up there.

19:48.000 --> 19:52.000
Britannia is strange, my Lord.
First you think, "This is a bit weird."

19:52.000 --> 19:56.000
But slowly, very slowly it grows on you.
You watch.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.000
Hm. Fuck arse! What's this?

20:00.000 --> 20:04.000
Ah! The locals wish to consecrate
a temple in your honor.

20:06.000 --> 20:10.000
-Is that it?
-So far. Yes.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
Domitius, write this down,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
"The temple was hewn from marble.

20:16.000 --> 20:22.000
400 cubits by 800-fuck-arse-cubits,
trimmed in silver and alabaster."

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
Yes, Lord Caesar.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.000
Why isn't this place finished?
You've been here two years.

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
The invasion is proving a little more
arduous than we'd hoped.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
The road to glory is a long one.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.000
Speaking of long roads,
you're going home.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
My Lord?

20:39.000 --> 20:42.000
I'm to be given a triumph,
the conquering of Britannia.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
You're my mascot. The golden boy.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
-Big show, you'll enjoy it.
-I'm being recalled to Rome?

20:48.000 --> 20:53.000
-Don't sound too grateful.
-Indeed, Lord Caesar, it's just...

20:53.000 --> 20:55.000
-The resistance here is...
-No buts, General.

20:55.000 --> 21:00.000
Your work here is done.
Congratulations. You're going home.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
-Who's this?
-Queen Amena of the Cantii.

21:06.000 --> 21:09.000
One of our most loyal
and obedient allies.

21:09.000 --> 21:14.000
My Lord Caesar. Such an honor.

21:15.000 --> 21:19.000
There it is. My silver house.
At least something here is ready.

21:21.000 --> 21:24.000
-How do I look?
-Imperious.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
Divine, my lord.

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
Come now, Queen Amena.
Divine is a trifle strong.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
Are you not a god, Lord Caesar?

21:36.000 --> 21:40.000
Of course, I'm a fucking god.
You saw me. I was on an elephant.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
You looked celestial.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.000
It's critical we explain to the emperor

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
I need to stay
when he returns to Rome.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
The emperor is adamant.
You're central to his triumph.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.000
-The jewel in his crown.
-Very flattering,

21:52.000 --> 21:55.000
but there won't be a triumph
if I don't remain here.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
-And why is that?
-The Druids.

21:57.000 --> 22:01.000
-Druids...
-The Druids, my Lord...

22:02.000 --> 22:04.000
The Druids are the force in this land.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.000
They control the hearts
and minds of the people.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
-How?
-With magic.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
Magic?

22:13.000 --> 22:16.000
I don't care if it's real.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.000
The point is the people believe it
and they will kill for it.

22:19.000 --> 22:23.000
-I've established relations...
-Do you want to see some magic, General?

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
See this? Just shiny metal.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.000
But everyone believes in it.

22:31.000 --> 22:36.000
They'll work their lives away.
Betray friends. Kill.

22:39.000 --> 22:42.000
I have more legions
than any emperor ever commanded.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
But my greatest weapon?

22:45.000 --> 22:48.000
Save your tales of "Magic"
for the Senate.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
They will add such spice to my Triumph.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.000
Nothing. He just sits there.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
Come. He must not be disturbed.

23:52.000 --> 23:56.000
Night after night, we dance to help
Veran hear the god's will and for what?

23:56.000 --> 23:59.000
Must we wait
until the forests are all raped?

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
The land, the desert.
When will they speak to him?

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
Do you doubt Veran?

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
Do you never doubt Veran?

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
Why did he let the girl go?

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
We had her.

24:17.000 --> 24:20.000
We could've protected her. Schooled her.

24:20.000 --> 24:24.000
She would've grown strong
and now where is she?

24:24.000 --> 24:28.000
Out there alone. With a mad man.
With Pwykka.

24:28.000 --> 24:32.000
I brought my people more than 200 miles.

24:32.000 --> 24:36.000
Why did he let the girl go with her?
Why?

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
You hated me when I first came.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
You were a pain. A spoilt little baby.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.000
-Were you a goddess or a princess?
-I was confused.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
You're still confused.

25:13.000 --> 25:16.000
-Ow!
-These don't flow.

25:16.000 --> 25:20.000
These are backwards.
You're better than this. Focus.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.000
The second man has returned.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.000
For five moons, we have gathered
to know the god's will.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.000
It is time.

27:32.000 --> 27:39.000
Time for the trees to become arrows.
The stones, spearheads.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.000
The meadows, lakes of fire.

27:43.000 --> 27:47.000
The moon will find Lokka where he hides

27:48.000 --> 27:52.000
and the sun will burn out his eyes.

27:53.000 --> 27:58.000
The time has come
for the druids to fight.

28:03.000 --> 28:08.000
There is one who walks this land,
sent by the gods.

28:08.000 --> 28:15.000
A child. Only through her
shall this land be saved.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
She must pass many trials.

28:18.000 --> 28:22.000
But if she is indeed
the child of the gods,

28:22.000 --> 28:28.000
she will grow stronger than kings,
wiser than druids,

28:28.000 --> 28:32.000
and she will lead us into the light.

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
Our faith has been rewarded.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
The true path shown.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
The truth is, I...

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
I never felt so afraid.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.000
Earlier, I went into Veran's cave.

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
There on the ground I...

29:03.000 --> 29:06.000
-I saw something.
-What did you see?

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
It was drawn in the dust.

29:12.000 --> 29:16.000
Quane. Quane, tell me.

29:20.000 --> 29:26.000
The snake...
with the sign of the dead man.

29:30.000 --> 29:34.000
The horsemen are ready, General.
All one hundred.

29:34.000 --> 29:38.000
Stand them down till morning.
I've got bigger problems.

29:39.000 --> 29:44.000
Queen Amena. Why don't you
tell us more about these druids?

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
The one the general is so afraid of.

29:46.000 --> 29:49.000
The druids are whores.
Their time is over.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.000
See, General? And she should know.

29:51.000 --> 29:54.000
The druids have power
over the rebel tribes.

29:54.000 --> 29:56.000
If that power finds a focus,

29:56.000 --> 29:59.000
Domitius will be writing
a very different story.

29:59.000 --> 30:03.000
Do you take me for a scribe, General?
I am no scribe.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.000
Then what are you, Domitius?

30:07.000 --> 30:09.000
His father is a very powerful senator.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.000
-Well, I just won a bet.
-Now, now, General.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.000
He is my eyes and ears.
You should beware him.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.000
Look at him, squirming like a squid.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.000
My generals love to think
they're special.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Like prize bulls.

30:27.000 --> 30:31.000
They have rings through their noses
though, for me to tug on.

30:31.000 --> 30:34.000
What do you think of my prized bull,
Amena?

30:35.000 --> 30:38.000
-General Aulus is a great man.
-But not a god, eh?

30:39.000 --> 30:42.000
Lord Caesar, I beg you
to reconsider my posting.

30:43.000 --> 30:45.000
The very fate of the occupation
is at stake.

30:46.000 --> 30:49.000
I've been many places,
fought many battles for the Empire.

30:50.000 --> 30:54.000
The battle, the true battle
does not always unfold upon the field.

30:54.000 --> 30:59.000
Defeat a hundred armies.
Subdue a continent. Sometimes...

31:00.000 --> 31:03.000
...it is the one man you need to fear.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
The one who can stir the dead...

31:10.000 --> 31:13.000
...tear down temples...

31:14.000 --> 31:16.000
...shift the pillars of time.

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
That's where the true danger lies.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.000
Do you remember Golgotha, General?

31:30.000 --> 31:35.000
The place of skulls.
Ten or 15 years ago.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.000
I remember it.

31:43.000 --> 31:46.000
What of it?

31:46.000 --> 31:49.000
Well, I must say, General,
you, sir, are a total mystery.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
Here we are, a dank, gray hell pit
on the edge of the world...

31:54.000 --> 31:56.000
-No offense.
-None taken.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
And you're fighting
tooth and bollocks to stay.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
I wonder what can be
keeping him here, eh, Amena?

32:05.000 --> 32:08.000
To going home. Eh, General?

32:08.000 --> 32:11.000
-To going home.
-Home, Lord Caesar.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.000
Let me show you a little bit of home.

32:30.000 --> 32:32.000
Sit, child.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.000
We must prepare to leave this place.

32:40.000 --> 32:43.000
Now the gods have spoken.
There's no time to lose.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
-You should try to sleep.
-I've been asleep for months.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
It's good to smell the air, the breeze.

32:54.000 --> 32:58.000
The journey ahead
is a journey into darkness.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
The Druids may not survive...

33:01.000 --> 33:04.000
..but we must ensure
that the light prevails.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.000
Veran...

33:11.000 --> 33:13.000
Was there anything else you saw?

33:14.000 --> 33:16.000
What do you mean?

33:16.000 --> 33:20.000
Other visions, other... signs?

33:29.000 --> 33:34.000
The way is revealed to Veran alone.
and Veran reveals the way.

33:34.000 --> 33:38.000
-Yes, of course...
-There is no road back. Speak, child.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
Quane said he saw something...

33:44.000 --> 33:46.000
...drawn in the dirt.

33:48.000 --> 33:52.000
-A sign.
-Quane was mistaken.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.000
There was no sign.

34:09.000 --> 34:13.000
-Fit for an emperor?
-It will most certainly do.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.000
-How about a god?
-Now, now, you know the new rules.

34:18.000 --> 34:21.000
The Senate can't hear us
all the way over here.

34:21.000 --> 34:25.000
I know it. You know it.
The gods know it.

34:27.000 --> 34:31.000
You're a divine. Go on, I dare you.

34:33.000 --> 34:38.000
All right then. I'm a god.

34:39.000 --> 34:43.000
-Louder.
-I'm a god!

34:45.000 --> 34:48.000
-Bollocks. A toast!
-Excuse me?

34:50.000 --> 34:54.000
-To your divine victory.
-My divine victory.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.000
You see, it isn't your victory.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.000
It isn't your victory
because it isn't your war.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.000
-What did you say?
-Having trouble hearing?

35:09.000 --> 35:13.000
-Seeing?
-I've drunk too much. I don't feel well.

35:13.000 --> 35:16.000
That's because
I've poisoned your wine.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.000
It's all right.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.000
Don't be scared.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.000
Soon you'll fall asleep.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.000
But before you do, know this.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.000
You are not a god.

35:40.000 --> 35:44.000
You are a fat, inadequate,
slobbering mark.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
A stand-in.

35:48.000 --> 35:51.000
I... I don't feel very well.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.000
You have no idea what game you're in.

35:56.000 --> 36:01.000
Where you are, who you are.
The forces at play here.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.000
Taxes, victory parades.
You think that's why I'm here?

36:07.000 --> 36:09.000
I'm fighting a different war.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
The last war.

36:15.000 --> 36:18.000
And in that war, I'm in charge...

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
..and I always was.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.000
Let me introduce myself.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
I am Hell.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.000
Where I walk... is Hell.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.000
Guards! Guards!

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
-Keep him like that.
-Yes, General.

37:25.000 --> 37:28.000
-Close the perimeter. No-one leaves.
-All right, General.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.000
-What happened?
-The emperor has been poisoned.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.000
Stop! You'll kill him.

38:01.000 --> 38:06.000
The sign of the snake
has not been seen for 10,000 years.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.000
I don't understand. Why would Veran lie?

38:26.000 --> 38:28.000
Can you hear me?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.000
Can you hear me, brother?

38:49.000 --> 38:51.000
Did you miss me, brother?

38:56.000 --> 39:00.000
Well, I'm back.
So listen very carefully now.

39:07.000 --> 39:09.000
I will find her.

39:17.000 --> 39:21.000
We should've kept her with us.
We could've protected her.

39:23.000 --> 39:28.000
She's just a lamb.
She... She's not ready yet.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.000
Today...

40:54.000 --> 41:00.000
No. No, no, no... No, no, no...

41:02.000 --> 41:03.000
Oh, shit.
