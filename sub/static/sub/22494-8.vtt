Johnny 5 is alive!

00:43.574 --> 00:46.309
What will Johnny 5 do first?

00:50.514 --> 00:52.515
I'm thirsty!

00:52.550 --> 00:54.784
I'm hungry!

00:54.819 --> 00:55.852
I'm Batman.

00:55.886 --> 00:59.556
The night my car careened off
that Mississippi Highway and

00:59.590 --> 01:02.392
flipped into a ditch is a
night I'll never forget.

01:02.426 --> 01:05.695
To be fair, I don't remember
much about the accident itself,

01:05.730 --> 01:07.797
'cause I was banged up pretty bad.

01:07.832 --> 01:10.900
There was much speculation
as to what occurred on that

01:10.935 --> 01:14.604
unseasonably cold August night,
but the most common thing I hear

01:14.639 --> 01:19.042
is, "Morgan Freeman, you've been in
more than 75 feature-length films.

01:19.076 --> 01:23.880
Why on God's green earth do you
drive a 1997 Nissan Maxima?"

01:23.914 --> 01:28.151
And for that question, like all questions,
there's more than one answer.

01:28.185 --> 01:32.656
You see, a '97 Maxima represented a
significant improvement over the previous

01:32.690 --> 01:33.556
year's model.

01:33.591 --> 01:38.228
And compared to my '89 Ford Probe,
well, it wasn't even a fair contest.

01:38.262 --> 01:41.631
In 2002, there was a factory
recall on the alternator, but I

01:41.666 --> 01:44.701
brought it right in, and they
fixed it in a day or so.

01:44.735 --> 01:47.470
They even gave me a loaner,
a brand-new Altima.

01:47.505 --> 01:49.706
Nice car, but it's
certainly no Maxima.

01:49.740 --> 01:51.308
Oh, oh, and that right there?

01:51.342 --> 01:54.411
That's the flip that should
have killed me, but thanks to

01:54.445 --> 01:57.547
Nissan's five-star crash rating,
along with dual air bags,

01:57.581 --> 02:00.450
crumple zone, seat-belt
pre-tensioners, and side-door

02:00.484 --> 02:02.385
beams, well, I'm alive today.

02:02.420 --> 02:07.590
I suppose the other noteworthy aspect of
this story is I've been [bleep] my own

02:07.625 --> 02:09.425
step-granddaughter.

02:11.262 --> 02:13.596
It seems like a form of
hysterical blindness.

02:13.631 --> 02:15.932
Has he been through any
traumatic events lately?

02:15.966 --> 02:18.935
Perhaps seen something that
could have caused this?

02:19.036 --> 02:21.371
Not that I can think of.

02:30.147 --> 02:32.816
I can't believe you gave
up your powers for me.

02:32.850 --> 02:35.919
I...love you, Lois.

02:41.659 --> 02:43.226
I don't know what to say.

02:43.260 --> 02:45.995
I love you, Lana.

02:46.030 --> 02:47.530
Superman...Man of steel.

02:47.565 --> 02:50.967
So, I come out of the booth all
hunched and kind of woozy on

02:51.001 --> 02:53.002
my feet like this, like, "oh, oh."

02:53.037 --> 02:54.170
And then bam! Boom!

02:54.205 --> 02:55.338
Kneel before my rod.

02:55.373 --> 02:56.539
How about that, huh?

02:56.574 --> 02:58.942
I'm fast, player, but
you the fastest.

02:58.976 --> 03:00.410
Bam! Right up in that ass.

03:00.444 --> 03:02.445
Oh, yeah!

03:08.786 --> 03:12.322
I-I can't believe you
did that for me.

03:30.074 --> 03:32.742
It's okay if I call you dad, right,
Mr. Drummond?

03:32.777 --> 03:33.576
Of course.

03:33.611 --> 03:35.879
Why would that make
anyone uncomfortable?

03:35.913 --> 03:38.948
Dudley and I want to spend the
afternoon at the bike shop.

03:38.983 --> 03:39.749
All alone?

03:39.784 --> 03:40.683
I don't like it.

03:40.718 --> 03:41.551
Please, dad?

03:41.585 --> 03:43.386
I'll do all my chores this week.

03:43.421 --> 03:44.587
I'll be your slave.

03:44.622 --> 03:47.857
Oh, now, Arnold, our
relationship as father/son in no

03:47.892 --> 03:51.394
ways resembles the owner/slave
dynamic of yes... you know what?

03:51.429 --> 03:52.529
Just go.

03:52.563 --> 03:53.630
Bottoms up, boys.

03:53.664 --> 03:56.399
I-I don't think my dad would
like me drinking wine.

03:56.434 --> 03:58.501
Arnold, I'm a
middle-aged white man.

03:58.536 --> 04:00.703
I automatically know
what's best for you.

04:00.738 --> 04:05.041
You do sound like Mr. Drummond.

04:09.680 --> 04:10.079
Dad.

04:10.114 --> 04:11.781
Arnold? Where have you been?

04:11.816 --> 04:13.550
Dad, I don't know what to do.

04:13.584 --> 04:16.452
The Maytag repairman is
showing me naked cartoons.

04:16.487 --> 04:18.822
I want you to listen
very carefully.

04:18.856 --> 04:20.490
What comes next is important.

04:20.524 --> 04:24.394
He's going to ask you to play Tarzan,
and Dudley's going to be into it.

04:24.428 --> 04:26.830
The audience might laugh,
but it's not funny.

04:26.864 --> 04:29.532
They're just confused by
the massive shift in tone.

04:29.567 --> 04:31.734
What exactly are you
getting at, dad?

04:31.769 --> 04:34.370
Aaaah!

04:36.740 --> 04:38.074
I don't know who you are.

04:38.108 --> 04:39.409
I don't know what you want.

04:39.443 --> 04:42.479
If you're looking for ransom, I
can tell you I'm a man of means.

04:42.513 --> 04:44.514
I probably shouldn't
have told you that.

04:44.548 --> 04:46.950
If you return my son, that
will be the end of it.

04:46.984 --> 04:49.886
But if you keep him, I will find
you and I will awkwardly ask

04:49.920 --> 04:52.489
parents to have a frank
discussion with their children

04:52.523 --> 04:53.923
about what they've just seen.

04:53.958 --> 05:00.296
Good luck.

05:00.331 --> 05:01.764
What do you want? Money?

05:01.799 --> 05:03.233
It's not much, but take it!

05:03.267 --> 05:04.767
Don't matter what you got!

05:04.802 --> 05:05.502
Not a lot?!

05:05.536 --> 05:06.436
So what?!

05:09.807 --> 05:12.308
And this is my
sister, Rainbow Dim.

05:12.343 --> 05:13.977
9/11 was an inside job.

05:14.011 --> 05:15.979
Oh, sure it was.

05:17.815 --> 05:18.982
Hey, do I know you?

05:19.016 --> 05:19.716
Not yet.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.317
You want to get out of here?

05:21.352 --> 05:23.786
Absolutely.

05:26.924 --> 05:27.457
Hey!

05:27.491 --> 05:29.726
You stole my kidney, didn't you?

05:29.760 --> 05:31.127
Oh, you got me.

05:32.229 --> 05:33.963
I guess I'm the asshole.

05:33.998 --> 05:36.633
Well, look at the mirror.

05:38.035 --> 05:39.802
You?

05:41.705 --> 05:44.107
Well, good luck selling
