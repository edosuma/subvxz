* Love and marriage *

00:21.400 --> 00:25.300
* Go together like
A horse and carriage *

00:25.300 --> 00:29.467
* This I tell ya, brother *

00:29.467 --> 00:33.934
* You can't have one
Without the other *

00:33.934 --> 00:36.167
* Love and marriage *

00:36.167 --> 00:38.801
* Love and marriage *

00:38.801 --> 00:43.067
* It's an institute
You can't disparage *

00:43.067 --> 00:47.000
* Ask the local gentry *

00:47.000 --> 00:51.434
* And they will say
It's elementary *

00:51.434 --> 00:56.300
* Try, try, try
To separate them *

00:56.300 --> 00:59.934
* It's an illusion *

00:59.934 --> 01:06.801
* Try, try, try
And you will only come *

01:06.801 --> 01:08.534

01:17.601 --> 01:20.033
Hey, Peg. What's
for breakfast?

01:20.033 --> 01:21.200
Nothing.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.767
We had that
yesterday....

01:23.767 --> 01:26.801
But you sure know
how to make it.

01:26.801 --> 01:30.200
Whose mail did the mailman
bring by mistake today?

01:30.200 --> 01:31.701
Steve and Marcie's.

01:31.701 --> 01:33.200
They get such good magazines.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.667
Should we keep their
Architectural Digest?

01:35.667 --> 01:37.968
Aw, why not? It'll impress
Steve and Marcie

01:37.968 --> 01:40.968
when they see it
on our couch.

01:40.968 --> 01:42.467
What else did we get?

01:42.467 --> 01:44.033
Well, here's a letter

01:44.033 --> 01:45.968
from Steve's friend
in West Germany

01:45.968 --> 01:47.968
that he
plays chess with.

01:47.968 --> 01:49.634
Oh, look. It's
Steve's turn.

01:49.634 --> 01:51.033
Let's see.

01:51.033 --> 01:55.734
I think I'll move the
queen over here...

01:55.734 --> 01:58.167
where
no one else is.

01:58.167 --> 02:00.901
I know that's where
I'd like to be.

02:00.901 --> 02:02.901
Since you're
doing your life,

02:02.901 --> 02:04.334
why don't you
lay the king down

02:04.334 --> 02:06.434
and have those two horses
run back and forth over him?

02:07.968 --> 02:09.501
One move at a time, Al.

02:09.501 --> 02:11.000
Hey, look at this.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Steve and Marcie got invited
to fill out an application

02:13.000 --> 02:15.968
for some new TV game show,
 <i>How Do I Love Thee?</i>

02:15.968 --> 02:18.467
Oh, that's that game
show for newlyweds.

02:18.467 --> 02:21.467
Yeah, it's coming
to Chicago for one week only.

02:21.467 --> 02:23.000
We'll keep that.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.567
We'll have fun filling
it out for them.

02:25.934 --> 02:27.501
Hey, look at this.

02:27.501 --> 02:28.934
Steve and Marcie's phone bill
is $200.

02:28.934 --> 02:32.968
What a pair of morons to spend
that much time on the phone.

02:32.968 --> 02:35.734
Look. There must be 100 calls
to 976 numbers.

02:35.734 --> 02:37.033
What losers.

02:37.033 --> 02:39.501
That's our phone bill, Al.

02:43.567 --> 02:46.767
Hey, Mom, my clothes,
they smell...clean.

02:46.767 --> 02:50.267
And my sweater, you can
tell what color it is.

02:50.267 --> 02:51.267
Yeah, look.

02:51.267 --> 02:56.901
You got those grass
stains off the back.

02:56.901 --> 03:00.367
I told you, I fell.

03:00.367 --> 03:02.868
That's it, kids.
Let's hear it for your mom.

03:02.868 --> 03:04.400
We're always quick
to criticize her

03:04.400 --> 03:07.400
when she doesn't wash or cook
or clean or scrub, or...

03:07.400 --> 03:09.901
Well, let's face it.
She does nothing.

03:09.901 --> 03:11.901
But you've got to admit,
after all these years,

03:11.901 --> 03:15.801
she's finally found a way
how to get our clothes clean.

03:15.801 --> 03:17.334
[DOORBELL RINGS]

03:20.934 --> 03:22.434
Here's your laundry.

03:22.434 --> 03:24.934
I'm sorry it took so long,

03:24.934 --> 03:29.067
but Al's shorts were
particularly tricky today.

03:29.067 --> 03:33.601
Thank you, Mrs. Rhoades.

03:33.601 --> 03:36.200
Good work,
Mrs. Rhoades.

03:38.801 --> 03:41.701
Look, Peggy, I know your
washing machine's broken,

03:41.701 --> 03:44.467
but when I offered
to help 16 days ago,

03:44.467 --> 03:46.634
I thought Al would have
fixed it by now.

03:46.634 --> 03:50.067
Yeah, me too,
but then I just gave up.

03:50.067 --> 03:53.133
I'll get you today's load,
Marce.

03:53.133 --> 03:56.601
Oh. You get
Architectural Digest?

03:56.601 --> 03:59.968
We used to.
I wonder what happened.

03:59.968 --> 04:02.501
Well, maybe you
should resubscribe.

04:02.501 --> 04:05.000
It's an excellent magazine.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.167
[DOORBELL RINGS]

04:06.167 --> 04:08.000
You want to get that, Marcie?

04:17.100 --> 04:20.033
Uh, Marcie, before
I go to work...

04:20.033 --> 04:21.534
I was
just wondering.

04:21.534 --> 04:24.033
You think you
could find some time

04:24.033 --> 04:26.501
to do any
of my laundry?

04:26.501 --> 04:29.434
Look, Steve.
I have a job too, you know.

04:29.434 --> 04:31.100
I'm putting a stop
to this right now.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.701
I thought I hit
a new low yesterday

04:32.701 --> 04:34.801
when I went to work 
in my Nehru jacket,

04:34.801 --> 04:37.300
but obviously
I was mistaken.

04:37.300 --> 04:38.801
Take your own crusted laundry,

04:38.801 --> 04:42.467
beat it against a rock,
but keep it out of our house.

04:42.467 --> 04:44.667
But our washing
machine's broken.

04:44.667 --> 04:45.801
No, it isn't.

04:45.801 --> 04:47.033
It's married to me,
and I'm taking it back.

04:47.033 --> 04:49.834
Hey, look, Steve,
what do you want us to do?

04:49.834 --> 04:51.467
Start paying
for the detergent?

04:51.467 --> 04:53.734
They weren't paying
for detergent?

04:53.734 --> 04:57.934
Well, I felt
uncomfortable asking.

04:57.934 --> 04:59.868
Well, the free ride
is over.

04:59.868 --> 05:01.267
Hey, here's a radical thought.

05:01.267 --> 05:03.267
Why don't you take your laundry
to the Laundromat

05:03.267 --> 05:04.367
and do it yourself?

05:04.367 --> 05:08.334
Ha ha! I'm not going
to the Laundromat.

05:08.334 --> 05:10.801
Why don't you buy
a new washing machine?

05:10.801 --> 05:12.801
Gee, Steve, I'm a little
short this week.

05:12.801 --> 05:15.300
I got my paycheck.

05:17.767 --> 05:21.334
Well, maybe we could
loan you the money--

05:21.334 --> 05:22.868
Excuse us.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.834
No. Please.

05:27.834 --> 05:29.534
Money is
important to me.

05:29.534 --> 05:30.767
They are not.

05:30.767 --> 05:33.801
Oh, Steve.
It's only $500.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.334
It's worth it.

05:35.334 --> 05:38.300
Have you seen
their laundry?

05:38.300 --> 05:40.300
Marcie, I am putting
my foot down.

05:40.300 --> 05:43.300
That is, if it's
okay with you.

05:43.300 --> 05:47.300
That $500 is going
for a super VHS...

05:47.300 --> 05:51.167
for the bedroom.

05:51.167 --> 05:52.501
Oh, Steve.

05:52.501 --> 05:55.434
Well, it was going
to be a surprise.

05:55.434 --> 05:57.000
You're wonderful.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.033
To hell with them.

06:00.033 --> 06:02.734
Could we have
a loan from your bank?

06:05.434 --> 06:07.100
Gee, I hate them.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.601
Well, so much
for clean clothes.

06:09.601 --> 06:12.601
Peg, I didn't want
to say this in front of them,

06:12.601 --> 06:15.467
but you could go
to the Laundromat.

06:15.467 --> 06:16.968
Oh, be serious, Al.

06:16.968 --> 06:19.133
Now, what are we going to do?

06:19.133 --> 06:21.434
I don't know, Peg,
but I'll tell you one thing.

06:21.434 --> 06:22.968
They're not getting
their mail from me.

06:22.968 --> 06:24.100
I know.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.267
Why don't we burn
that application

06:25.267 --> 06:26.567
to the game show?

06:26.567 --> 06:30.067
You know, Al, they give away
prizes on those shows.

06:30.067 --> 06:32.434
Ha ha. Even better.
They won't get any now.

06:32.434 --> 06:33.934
No, honey.

06:33.934 --> 06:36.434
I mean prizes, you know,
like washing machines.

06:36.434 --> 06:38.434
Look, Peg, they don't
need one.

06:38.434 --> 06:42.467
Listen, Machiavelli,
all we have to do

06:42.467 --> 06:45.868
is fill out that application
as Steve and Marcie,

06:45.868 --> 06:48.133
put our address down
as their address,

06:48.133 --> 06:50.033
and get on the show.

06:50.033 --> 06:52.868
Yeah. Maybe we could
win a washer/dryer.

06:52.868 --> 06:58.100
Wow.

06:58.100 --> 07:00.167
That's much
better than my idea

07:00.167 --> 07:02.133
of going on the show,
losing,

07:02.133 --> 07:03.501
and coming home
with nothing.

07:03.501 --> 07:05.801
Well, you know, someone's
got to do the thinking

07:05.801 --> 07:07.400
for us, Peg.

to <i>How Do I Love Thee?</i>

07:25.334 --> 07:27.501
the game show
that dares to ask

07:27.501 --> 07:30.534
"How do I love thee?"

07:30.534 --> 07:32.200
For those of you
who are totally ignorant

07:32.200 --> 07:34.133
of today's superstars,

07:42.367 --> 07:44.167
Here's our own
little piece of fluff

07:44.167 --> 07:46.834
that the network
thrust upon me--

07:46.834 --> 07:48.868
the lovely Zelda.

07:48.868 --> 07:51.601
[APPLAUSE]

07:57.901 --> 07:59.901
Yes, soon to be
appearing naked

07:59.901 --> 08:03.634
in <i>Squish</i> magazine.

08:03.634 --> 08:06.133
Now, just a little reminder
of what we're all about.

08:06.133 --> 08:07.801
We take two
newly married couples

08:07.801 --> 08:09.267
and find out how much

08:09.267 --> 08:10.734
they're willing to
torture their loved ones

08:10.734 --> 08:12.934
for cheap prizes.

08:12.934 --> 08:15.467
Sound good? You betcha!

08:15.467 --> 08:18.033
Then let
the games begin!

08:18.033 --> 08:21.334
Right, Bink.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.667
Okay.

08:24.667 --> 08:26.667
Now let's meet
our loving couples.

08:26.667 --> 08:28.968
First, from
Cow Lake, Wisconsin,

08:28.968 --> 08:30.901
they've been married
16 months.

08:30.901 --> 08:32.100
He's a TV repairman.

08:32.100 --> 08:34.400
She's a directory
assistance operator.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.501
Meet Roland
and Mona Squab!

08:36.501 --> 08:39.167
[APPLAUSE]

08:46.634 --> 08:49.200
And their opponents
from Chicago, Illinois,

08:49.200 --> 08:50.601
married 13 months.

08:50.601 --> 08:52.234
He's a banker.
She's a bankette.

08:52.234 --> 08:54.334
Meet lovebirds
Steve and Marcie Rhoades.

08:54.334 --> 08:56.501
[APPLAUSE]

09:08.901 --> 09:11.734
God, I love you.

09:11.734 --> 09:13.901
Come on now,
Mr. Rhoades.

09:13.901 --> 09:16.634
Leave the lovely
Zelda alone.

09:16.634 --> 09:18.834
Who knows where
she's been?

09:20.767 --> 09:23.300
Okay, any questions
before we get to our game?

09:23.300 --> 09:24.334
Uh, yeah.

09:24.334 --> 09:27.567
Hey, Bink, do you
know Bob Barker?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.300
Okay.

09:29.300 --> 09:32.133
Let's play <i>How</i>
 <i>Do I Love Thee?</i>

09:32.133 --> 09:34.133
Lovely Zelda,
will you take our wives

09:34.133 --> 09:36.634
over to our
love test area?

09:36.634 --> 09:37.567
Right, Bink.

09:42.567 --> 09:44.968
We can't bear
to be apart.

09:44.968 --> 09:47.300
AUDIENCE: Aww...

09:47.300 --> 09:49.868
Mr. Rhoades, would you like
to kiss your wife goodbye?

09:49.868 --> 09:53.367
Only if it really
was goodbye.

09:57.133 --> 10:01.133
Okay, husbands, now, we know
you love your little fillies.

10:01.133 --> 10:05.000
Let's see how much you love
our first little prize.

10:05.000 --> 10:07.033
What's the prize,
lovely Zelda?

10:07.033 --> 10:10.767
It's a bowling ball, Bink.

10:10.767 --> 10:13.534
A pretty one.

10:16.334 --> 10:21.734
Okay, hubbies,
let's earn those balls.

10:29.901 --> 10:33.400
Now, the man who's willing
to set aside his love

10:33.400 --> 10:35.701
and spin his wife
the fastest

10:35.701 --> 10:37.267
wins the ball.

10:37.267 --> 10:41.601
Uh, Steve, remember, honey,
you already have a bowling ball.

10:41.601 --> 10:45.133
Ready to spin, Bink!

10:45.133 --> 10:46.634
Now, remember the coin toss,
Steve.

10:46.634 --> 10:49.400
Roland won the right
to go first.

10:49.400 --> 10:50.901
Roland?

10:52.100 --> 10:54.567
It's for
a bowling ball, dear.

10:54.567 --> 10:57.501
You deserve it.

10:59.934 --> 11:02.100
[***]

11:06.367 --> 11:09.367
I couldn't bear to see her
up there like that, Bink.

11:09.367 --> 11:12.901
You came to play,
Roland.

11:12.901 --> 11:18.000
Steve, do you think you
can beat 1/4 of a turn?

11:18.000 --> 11:21.501
Well, let us see,
shall we?

11:22.934 --> 11:25.968
Uh...Steve, it won't
take much to win now.

11:25.968 --> 11:28.133
All you have to do
is spin me--

11:28.133 --> 11:29.133
Aah!

11:29.133 --> 11:32.400
Aah!

11:32.400 --> 11:36.968
Whoa! You really like
bowling, eh, Steve?

11:36.968 --> 11:39.167
Well, what the hell?

11:39.167 --> 11:40.634
It's all for fun,
right?

11:40.634 --> 11:43.000
Give me
my bowling ball.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.133
Looks like Marcie's
going to be spinning

11:45.133 --> 11:47.634
for a while,

11:47.634 --> 11:49.934
so why don't we take
a little commercial break?

11:49.934 --> 11:53.033
Don't go away.
I know Marcie won't.

12:07.801 --> 12:10.467
Looks like Marcie's
off the wheel.

12:10.467 --> 12:12.601
Let's bring her out.

12:17.601 --> 12:18.934
Over this way, Marcie.

12:28.734 --> 12:30.334
Come on now, kids.

12:30.334 --> 12:33.767
Marcie, your chance
is coming up right now.

12:33.767 --> 12:35.367
Lovely Zelda,

12:35.367 --> 12:38.501
would you like to take
our husbands backstage?

12:38.501 --> 12:40.567
Right, Bink.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.601
Bink, Steve won't let me touch
the lovely Zelda.

12:50.601 --> 12:54.167
Well, then, you won't be
at the clinic getting a shot.

12:59.434 --> 13:02.067
Okay, lovely Zelda, would you
like to show our ladies

13:02.067 --> 13:03.634
What they'll
be competing for?

13:03.634 --> 13:05.868
It's this lovely watch.

13:12.567 --> 13:14.000
You got to wonder
what she'd do

13:14.000 --> 13:19.467
if it was a lovely hat.

13:19.467 --> 13:22.000
All right, ladies, would you
like that watch?

13:22.000 --> 13:23.100
It's swell, Bink.

13:23.100 --> 13:24.434
Marcie?

13:24.434 --> 13:27.434
Oh, Bink, that's the prettiest
watch I've ever seen.

13:27.434 --> 13:30.834
All my life I've wanted
a watch like that.

13:30.834 --> 13:32.868
Nail him
to the wheel, Bink.

13:32.868 --> 13:35.100
No wheel this time, Marcie.

13:35.100 --> 13:37.367
Lovely Zelda,
the curtain, if you please.

13:43.701 --> 13:46.367
We call this
a heavy problem.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.267
Lovely Zelda, would you
bring out the fat women, please?

13:56.367 --> 13:58.367
Now, the idea here is this.

13:58.367 --> 13:59.868
Your wives will determine

13:59.868 --> 14:02.367
how many of these
full-figured women

14:02.367 --> 14:05.467
will get to sit
on top of you.

14:05.467 --> 14:07.901
We quit, Bink.

14:07.901 --> 14:10.033
Pour them on, Bink!

14:10.033 --> 14:13.067
Remember, the wife
that cries "uncle" first

14:13.067 --> 14:14.334
loses her chance
at the watch.

14:14.334 --> 14:16.167
But Roland could be hurt.

14:16.167 --> 14:19.033
That's what we're here for.

14:19.033 --> 14:20.868
Do we want to talk,

14:20.868 --> 14:23.501
or do we want
to squash some man?

14:23.501 --> 14:25.267
AUDIENCE: Squash! Squash!

14:25.267 --> 14:27.534
You're a lucky man.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.100
All right, ladies,
you're in charge.

14:31.100 --> 14:32.868
Mona, go for it.

14:34.334 --> 14:37.701
But, Bink, they're
so...large.

14:37.701 --> 14:39.200
God, you're dull.

14:39.200 --> 14:42.334
All right, Marcie, want to
show her how it's done?

14:42.334 --> 14:47.133
You betcha, Bink!
Start the herd!

14:47.133 --> 14:51.567
That's one ton!

14:51.567 --> 14:54.634
That's two tons!

14:54.634 --> 14:57.667
That's three tons!

14:57.667 --> 15:01.167
Gee, this is so much fun.
Come on, gals.

down there, Steve?

15:10.734 --> 15:16.567
I can taste my spleen.

15:16.567 --> 15:18.767
Well, Mrs. Rhoades,

15:18.767 --> 15:21.067
looks like
you won the watch.

15:23.501 --> 15:26.934
Hi, Mom.

15:26.934 --> 15:28.968
You want to go
for the record?

15:28.968 --> 15:30.801
Why not, Bink?

15:30.801 --> 15:33.534
Here comes Bertha.

15:39.067 --> 15:42.000
Well, it's time to
bid adieu to the Squabs.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.133
Goodbye, Squabs.

15:45.667 --> 15:47.100
We lost, Mona.

15:47.100 --> 15:48.567
I don't care,
sweetheart.

15:48.567 --> 15:50.300
I just couldn't bear
the thought of you

15:50.300 --> 15:53.367
in the killer bee
booth.

[APPLAUSE]

15:56.868 --> 16:00.734
By the way, you're
an excellent player.

16:00.734 --> 16:04.834
Hmm. Well, we can always
use another toaster.

16:04.834 --> 16:08.133
Well, Mrs. Rhoades,
before we total up your prizes,

16:08.133 --> 16:11.968
let's just see if your husband
is conscious yet.

16:11.968 --> 16:13.100
Lovely Zelda.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.234
How are you feeling,
Mr. Rhoades?

16:23.234 --> 16:25.267
My tongue's
a little swollen

16:25.267 --> 16:27.234
from the bee stings,
Bink.

16:29.067 --> 16:31.000
Well, let's take a moment here

16:31.000 --> 16:33.634
to find out
a little bit about you.

16:33.634 --> 16:35.567
So, Steve, you're
in the bank biz.

16:35.567 --> 16:36.567
What's it like?

16:36.567 --> 16:39.100
How the hell
would I know?

16:39.100 --> 16:42.033
Ooh, irritable. Marcie?

16:42.033 --> 16:44.634
Well, mostly we take out
these big fancy ads

16:44.634 --> 16:47.300
telling people
to come for a loan,

16:47.300 --> 16:50.167
and then we laugh at
them when they do.

16:50.167 --> 16:51.667
Now, what did we win?

16:51.667 --> 16:54.667
Let's see. You won
the bowling ball, the watch,

16:54.667 --> 16:56.033
and, of course,

16:56.033 --> 16:58.234
your record-breaking stay
in the killer bee booth

16:58.234 --> 16:59.834
netted you a toaster,

16:59.834 --> 17:01.033
but more important,

17:01.033 --> 17:03.267
you're entitled
to this week's grand prize,

17:03.267 --> 17:05.367
which is a washer/dryer!

17:05.367 --> 17:07.901
Oh! Ha ha ha ha!

17:07.901 --> 17:09.634
Aah!

17:11.534 --> 17:13.233
Happy, Steve?

17:13.233 --> 17:15.501
It's kind of hard
to talk here, Bink.

17:15.501 --> 17:16.834
Okay.

17:16.834 --> 17:20.701
Marcie, you can take your prizes
and go home right now,

17:20.701 --> 17:23.800
or you can risk
what you've won so far,

17:23.800 --> 17:26.200
send your husband back
into our torture chamber,

17:26.200 --> 17:28.968
and go for
our super grand prize.

is it? What is it?

just give her a rifle

17:47.701 --> 17:51.133
and have her shoot me?

17:51.133 --> 17:56.367
Too easy, Steve.

17:56.367 --> 17:58.100
Now, remember, if you lose,
you lose everything,

17:58.100 --> 18:00.400
but if you win,
you win everything.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.234
What do you think
Marcie will do?

18:03.234 --> 18:07.634
I love it!
I love it! I love it!

18:07.634 --> 18:11.000
Gee, Bink,
I don't know.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.100
We'll risk it, Bink.

18:13.100 --> 18:16.067

eh, folks?

down the pants?

in suspense.

18:41.234 --> 18:44.067
are going to be going up against
an old married couple

18:44.067 --> 18:47.367
who may not love each other
as much as you and your bride.

for the way

of a human life.

and our names, huh?

for a square meal.

getting that car.

turning up the dials,

remember, ease it up...
or you'll kill them.

the most juice into her hubby

20:39.334 --> 20:41.267
gets to drive off in that car,

20:41.267 --> 20:44.200

don't try this at home.
