WEBVTT

01:13.073 --> 01:14.575
- Bye.
- See you later.

02:01.204 --> 02:02.251
Bye!

02:05.459 --> 02:07.177
This is a customer announcement.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.925
The store will be closing
in five minutes. Thank you.

02:14.468 --> 02:15.515
Oi!

02:44.915 --> 02:45.962
Wilson?

02:48.126 --> 02:50.003
Wilson, I've got
the lottery money.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.428
Wilson?

02:53.507 --> 02:55.009
You there?

02:57.594 --> 03:00.768
Look, I can't hang about
'cause they're closing the shop.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.434
Wilson?

03:04.101 --> 03:05.774
Oh, come on.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.111
Hello?

03:13.735 --> 03:15.578
Hello? Wilson, it's Rose.

03:18.740 --> 03:19.787
Hello?

03:21.576 --> 03:22.748
Wilson?

03:49.312 --> 03:50.404
Wilson?

04:00.157 --> 04:01.409
Wilson!

04:19.176 --> 04:21.019
Oh, you're kidding me!

04:27.309 --> 04:29.812
Is that someone mucking about?

04:40.113 --> 04:41.615
Who is it?

04:59.299 --> 05:01.051
Okay. You got me.
Very funny.

05:04.679 --> 05:07.979
Right, I've got the joke!
Whose idea was this?

05:09.059 --> 05:10.982
Is it Derek's?
Is it?

05:13.188 --> 05:14.485
Derek, is this you?

05:38.672 --> 05:39.719
Run!

06:09.911 --> 06:13.586
- You pulled his arm off!
- Yep, plastic.

06:13.748 --> 06:16.467
Very clever, nice trick.
Who are they then, students?

06:16.585 --> 06:17.882
Is this a student thing
or what?

06:17.961 --> 06:20.384
- Why would they be students?
- I don't know!

06:20.630 --> 06:22.132
Well, you said it.
Why students?

06:22.465 --> 06:25.719
'Cause... To get that many
people dressed up and being silly,

06:25.802 --> 06:26.928
they got to be students.

06:27.762 --> 06:28.883
That makes sense. Well done.

06:29.472 --> 06:30.752
- Thanks.
- They're not students.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.310
Whoever they are, when Wilson finds
them, he's going to call the police.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.111
- Who's Wilson?
- Chief electrician.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.404
Wilson's dead.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.320
- That's just not funny. That's sick!
- Hold on!

06:40.400 --> 06:42.823
- Mind your eyes.
- I've had enough of this now.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.995
Who are you, then?
Who's that lot down there?

06:47.490 --> 06:49.163
I said who are they?

06:49.492 --> 06:52.496
They're made of plastic.
Living plastic creatures.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.090
And they're being controlled
by a relay device on the roof.

06:55.165 --> 06:58.135
Which would be a great big
problem if I didn't have this.

06:58.209 --> 07:01.008
So, I'm gonna go upstairs
and blow it up.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.097
And I might well die in the
process, but don't worry about me.

07:03.173 --> 07:06.723
No, you go home. Go on, go and have
your lovely beans on toast.

07:06.843 --> 07:10.188
Don't tell anyone about this, 'cause
if you do, you'll get them killed.

07:13.516 --> 07:14.483
I'm the Doctor, by the way.

07:14.559 --> 07:15.685
- What's your name?
- Rose.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.820
Nice to meet you, Rose.
Run for your life!

08:12.784 --> 08:15.003
The whole of Central
London has been closed off

08:15.412 --> 08:16.880
as police investigate the fire.

08:18.873 --> 08:23.424
I know, it's on the telly! It's
everywhere, she's lucky to be alive.

08:23.712 --> 08:26.591
Honestly, it's aged her.
Skin like an old Bible.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.888
He's walking in now.
You'd think I was her daughter.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.310
Oh, and here's himself.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.929
I've been phoning your mobile!
You could have been dead!

08:33.054 --> 08:34.294
It's on the news
and everything!

08:34.389 --> 08:36.232
I can't believe
that your shop went up!

08:36.307 --> 08:38.981
I'm all right.
Honestly, I'm fine. Don't make a fuss!

08:39.102 --> 08:41.104
- But what happened?
- I don't know.

08:41.479 --> 08:42.840
What was it though?
What caused it?

08:42.897 --> 08:45.150
I wasn't in the shop.
I was outside. Didn't see anything.

08:45.275 --> 08:49.121
It's Debbie. She knows a man on
The Mirror, 500 quid for an interview.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.114
Oh, that's brilliant,
give it here.

08:53.950 --> 08:55.827
You've got to find some way
of making money.

08:55.952 --> 08:58.375
Your job's kaput
and I'm not bailing you out.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.170
Bev, she's alive!

09:02.625 --> 09:05.219
I've told her,
sue for compensation.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.138
She was within
seconds of death!

09:07.422 --> 09:09.891
What are you drinking, tea? No, no, no.
That's no good! That's no good!

09:09.966 --> 09:11.013
You're in shock.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.264
- You need something stronger.
- I'm all right.

09:12.427 --> 09:14.521
Now, come one. You deserve a proper
drink. We're going down the pub.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.014
You and me, my treat.
How about it?

09:16.139 --> 09:18.437
Is there a match on?

09:18.516 --> 09:20.393
No, no.
I'm just thinking about you!

09:20.477 --> 09:21.854
There's a match on,
ain't there?

09:22.479 --> 09:24.902
Well that's not the point. But we
could catch the last five minutes.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.200
Go on, then.
I'm fine, really, go.

09:27.484 --> 09:28.531
And get rid of that.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.163
'BYE-bye.
- Bye!

09:44.000 --> 09:46.674
Fifteen fire crews are
in attendance,

09:46.795 --> 09:49.795
though it's thought there's very little
chance of saving the infrastructure.

10:19.244 --> 10:23.499
There's no point in getting up,
sweetheart. You've no job to go to.

10:28.211 --> 10:31.886
There's Finch's.
You could try them.

10:32.549 --> 10:34.669
- They've always got jobs.
- Oh, great, the butcher's.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.721
It might do you good. That shop
was giving you airs and graces.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.310
I'm not joking about
compensation.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.108
You've had genuine
shock and trauma.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.602
Ariana got two thousand
quid off the council

10:44.727 --> 10:47.401
just because the old man behind
the desk said she looked Greek!

10:48.356 --> 10:50.233
I know she is Greek,
but that's not the point.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.235
It was a valid claim.

10:56.906 --> 11:00.001
Mum, you're such a liar!
I said to nail that cat-flap down.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.328
We're gonna get strays!

11:01.411 --> 11:04.255
- I did it weeks back.
- Nah, you thought about it.

11:21.598 --> 11:23.316
- What are you doing here?
- I live here.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.773
- What do you do that for?
- 'Cause I do!

11:26.060 --> 11:28.233
I'm only home
'cause someone blew up my job!

11:28.605 --> 11:29.982
Must have got the wrong signal.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.700
You're not plastic,
are you? Nope, bonehead. Bye, then!

11:32.775 --> 11:35.073
You, inside, right now.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.450
Who is it?

11:38.448 --> 11:41.793
It's about last night. He's part
of the inquiry. Give us 10 minutes.

11:41.910 --> 11:44.288
She deserves compensation!

11:44.412 --> 11:45.629
Oh, we're talking millions.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.675
I'm...
I'm in my dressing gown.

11:50.668 --> 11:51.760
Yes, you are.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.923
There's a strange man
in my bedroom.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.304
Yes, there is.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.100
Well, anything could happen.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.106
No.

12:07.810 --> 12:10.108
Don't mind the mess.
Do you want a coffee?

12:10.188 --> 12:11.485
Might as well, thanks,
just milk.

12:12.649 --> 12:14.151
We should go to the police.

12:14.525 --> 12:15.697
Seriously.
Both of us.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.786
That won't last.
He's gay and she's an alien.

12:17.862 --> 12:20.991
I'm not blaming you, even if
it was some sort of joke...

12:21.115 --> 12:22.162
Mmm. Sad ending.

12:23.618 --> 12:26.497
- It said on the news they found a body.
- " Rose Tyler."

12:28.289 --> 12:31.042
Ah, could've been worse.
Look at the ears!

12:31.167 --> 12:33.716
All the same, he was nice.
He was a nice bloke.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.052
Anyway, if we are gonna
go to the police,

12:37.382 --> 12:38.542
I wanna know what I'm saying.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.644
- I want you to explain everything.
- Maybe not.

12:41.719 --> 12:43.187
What's that then?

12:44.889 --> 12:46.015
Have you got a cat?

12:46.391 --> 12:47.813
No.

12:48.893 --> 12:52.864
We did have, but we just get
strays. They come in off the estate.

12:58.528 --> 13:00.496
I told Mickey
to chuck that out.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.541
You're all the same.
Give a man a plastic hand...

13:04.200 --> 13:07.204
Anyway, I don't even
know your name. Doctor what was it?

13:36.733 --> 13:37.985
It's all right,
I've stopped it.

13:38.067 --> 13:41.412
- There you go, you see, armless!
- Do you think?

13:41.571 --> 13:42.572
Ow!

13:44.198 --> 13:46.576
Hold on a minute,
you can't just go swanning off!

13:46.701 --> 13:49.375
Yes. I can. Here I am.
This is me, swanning off, see ya!

13:49.454 --> 13:51.877
That arm was moving,
it tried to kill me!

13:51.956 --> 13:53.378
Ten out of ten for observation.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.586
You can't just walk away.
That's not fair.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.212
You've got to tell me
what's going on.

13:57.295 --> 13:58.387
No, I don't.

14:01.632 --> 14:04.556
All right, then. I'll go
to the police. I'll tell everyone.

14:05.303 --> 14:09.604
You said if I did that
I'd get people killed, so, your choice.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.859
Tell me or I'll start talking.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.778
- Is that supposed to sound tough?
- Sort of.

14:14.896 --> 14:15.988
Doesn't work.

14:16.773 --> 14:19.276
- Who are you?
- Told you, the Doctor.

14:19.650 --> 14:20.993
Yeah, but Doctor what?

14:21.110 --> 14:23.158
- Just the Doctor.
- The Doctor?

14:23.279 --> 14:24.451
Hello!

14:25.615 --> 14:27.617
Is that supposed
to sound impressive?

14:27.950 --> 14:28.997
Sort of.

14:29.619 --> 14:33.340
Come on then,
you can tell me. I've seen enough.

14:34.582 --> 14:38.257
- Are you the police?
- No! I was just passing through.

14:38.795 --> 14:39.967
I'm a long way from home...

14:40.088 --> 14:43.843
What have I done wrong? How come those
plastic things keep coming after me?

14:43.966 --> 14:46.469
Oh, suddenly
the entire world revolves around you.

14:46.594 --> 14:48.875
You were just an accident.
You got in the way, that's all.

14:48.971 --> 14:51.520
- It tried to kill me!
- It was after me, not you!

14:51.641 --> 14:54.019
Last night, in the shop,
I was there, you blundered in,

14:54.143 --> 14:55.440
almost ruined the whole thing.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.694
This morning, I was tracking it
down, it was tracking me down...

14:59.148 --> 15:01.321
The only reason it fixed
on you is because you met me.

15:01.442 --> 15:05.663
So, what you're saying
is the entire world revolves around you?

15:05.780 --> 15:07.908
- Sort of, yeah.
- You're full of it!

15:07.990 --> 15:09.617
Sort of, yeah.

15:11.119 --> 15:13.588
All this plastic stuff,
who else knows about it?

15:13.663 --> 15:15.040
No one.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.666
What, you're on your own?

15:17.667 --> 15:20.295
Well, who else is there? I mean,
you lot, all you do is eat chips,

15:20.378 --> 15:21.595
got to bed and watch telly,

15:21.671 --> 15:24.720
while all the time
underneath you, there's a war going on.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.724
Okay. Start from
the beginning.

15:30.847 --> 15:34.442
I mean, if we're going with the living
plastic, and I don't even believe that,

15:34.517 --> 15:36.645
but if we do...
How did you kill it?

15:37.353 --> 15:41.324
The thing controlling it projects life
into the arm. Cut off the signal - dead.

15:41.399 --> 15:43.868
- So, that's radio control?
- Thought control.

15:45.736 --> 15:47.579
- You all right?
- Yeah.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.619
So who's controlling it, then?

15:49.699 --> 15:51.747
- Long story.
- What's it all for?

15:51.868 --> 15:55.088
I mean, shop window dummies,
what's that about?

15:55.997 --> 15:57.838
Is someone trying
to take over Britain's shops?

15:59.167 --> 16:00.339
No!

16:00.751 --> 16:03.095
- Well, no!
- It's not a price war.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.518
They want to overthrow
the human race and destroy you.

16:09.886 --> 16:11.604
- Do you believe me?
- No.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.064
But you're still listening.

16:14.682 --> 16:17.902
Really, though, Doctor,
tell me, who are you?

16:23.774 --> 16:26.698
Do you know like we were saying?
About the Earth revolving?

16:29.864 --> 16:31.787
It's like when you're a kid.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.002
The first time they tell you
that the world's turning

16:34.076 --> 16:35.476
and you just can't quite believe it

16:35.578 --> 16:37.498
'cause everything looks
like it's standing still.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.426
I can feel it.

16:45.087 --> 16:47.055
The turn of the Earth.

16:47.882 --> 16:50.977
The ground beneath our feet
is spinning at 1,000 miles an hour.

16:51.469 --> 16:55.599
And the entire planet is hurtling
round the sun at 67,000 miles an hour.

16:55.932 --> 16:58.981
I can feel it,
we're falling through space, you and me.

17:00.102 --> 17:03.447
Clinging to the skin of this
tiny little world, and if we let go...

17:07.443 --> 17:08.865
That's who I am.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.821
Now forget me, Rose Tyler.

17:12.740 --> 17:13.787
Go home.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.684
- Hey, here's my woman! Kit off.
- Oh, shut up.

18:22.727 --> 18:25.480
- Coffee?
- Yeah, only if you wash the mug.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.986
And I don't mean rinse,
I mean wash. Can I use your computer?

18:28.065 --> 18:30.488
Yeah, any excuse
to get in the bedroom.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.038
Don't read my e-mails!

19:18.074 --> 19:19.121
You're not coming in.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.707
He's safe, he's got
a wife and kids.

19:22.787 --> 19:23.879
Yeah, who told you that?

19:23.954 --> 19:27.959
He did. That's exactly what an
internet lunatic murderer would say.

19:52.108 --> 19:55.954
Um, hello, I've come
to see Clive. We've been e-mailing.

19:56.153 --> 19:59.157
Oh, Dad! It's one
of your nutters.

20:02.660 --> 20:06.506
Sorry, hello!
You must be Rose. I'm Clive. Obviously.

20:06.789 --> 20:09.463
I'd better tell you now,
my boyfriend's in the car,

20:09.583 --> 20:11.176
just in case you're gonna
kill me!

20:11.293 --> 20:13.011
No, good point!
No murders!

20:14.296 --> 20:15.297
Who is it?

20:15.423 --> 20:17.346
Oh, it's something to do
with the Doctor.

20:17.466 --> 20:18.706
She's been reading the website.

20:18.801 --> 20:20.303
Please come through.
I'm in the shed.

20:22.304 --> 20:27.481
She? She's read a website
about the Doctor, she's a she?

20:32.314 --> 20:33.736
A lot of this stuff is
quite sensitive,

20:33.816 --> 20:35.284
I couldn't just send it to you.

20:35.359 --> 20:36.986
People might intercept...

20:37.111 --> 20:38.328
If you know what I mean.

20:38.821 --> 20:39.947
If you dig deep enough

20:40.489 --> 20:42.116
and keep a lively mind,

20:42.199 --> 20:44.622
this Doctor keeps
cropping up all over the place.

20:44.994 --> 20:48.669
Political diaries,
conspiracy theories, even ghost stories.

20:49.665 --> 20:52.839
No first name, no last name,
just "the Doctor".

20:53.669 --> 20:54.841
Always the Doctor.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.390
And the title seems to be
passed down from father to son,

20:58.507 --> 21:00.009
appears to be an inheritance.

21:00.134 --> 21:01.977
That's your Doctor
there, isn't it?

21:02.470 --> 21:03.471
Yeah.

21:03.554 --> 21:06.899
I tracked it down to the Washington
Public Archive, just last year.

21:07.016 --> 21:10.862
The online photo's enhanced,
but if we look at the original...

21:23.532 --> 21:27.912
November 22nd 1963,
the assassination of President Kennedy.

21:28.496 --> 21:29.543
See?

21:31.415 --> 21:33.008
Must be his father.

21:33.209 --> 21:34.586
Going further back,

21:35.169 --> 21:36.716
April 1912,

21:38.672 --> 21:41.391
this is a photograph of
the Daniels family of Southampton

21:41.884 --> 21:42.931
and friend.

21:43.761 --> 21:47.356
Taken the day before they were due to
sail to the new world. On the Titanic.

21:48.098 --> 21:51.227
And for some unknown reason,
they cancelled the trip, and survived.

21:51.936 --> 21:53.734
And here we are,

21:55.272 --> 21:57.525
1883, another Doctor.

21:58.025 --> 22:00.619
Look, the same lineage,
he's identical.

22:01.904 --> 22:03.747
This one washed up
on the coast of Sumatra,

22:03.864 --> 22:06.083
and the very night
the Krakatoa exploded.

22:07.243 --> 22:09.917
The Doctor is a legend
woven throughout history.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.252
When disaster comes,
he's there.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.459
He brings the storm
in his wake.

22:15.251 --> 22:17.754
- And he has one constant companion.
- Who's that?

22:19.088 --> 22:20.135
Death.

22:43.487 --> 22:46.411
If the Doctor's back,
if you've seen him, Rose,

22:47.283 --> 22:48.910
then one thing's for certain.

22:50.119 --> 22:51.587
We're all in danger.

23:27.323 --> 23:28.370
Come on then.

23:28.991 --> 23:32.120
If he singled you out,
if the Doctor's making house calls,

23:35.873 --> 23:37.466
then God help you.

24:21.251 --> 24:22.548
But who is he?

24:22.878 --> 24:24.004
Who do you think he is?

24:24.880 --> 24:26.223
I think he's the same man.

24:27.675 --> 24:28.847
I think he's immortal.

24:31.387 --> 24:33.765
I think he's an alien
from another world.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.986
All right, he's a nutter.
Off his head.

24:39.061 --> 24:42.691
Complete online
conspiracy freak, you win!

24:43.607 --> 24:45.905
What are we
going to do tonight?

24:46.568 --> 24:47.694
I fancy a pizza.

24:47.778 --> 24:50.247
Pizza!

24:50.739 --> 24:52.457
- Pizza!
- Or Chinese.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.410
Pizza!

25:05.921 --> 25:07.673
Do you think I should
try the hospital?

25:07.756 --> 25:10.179
Suki said they had jobs going
in the canteen.

25:11.510 --> 25:14.389
Is that it then,
dishing out chips?

25:15.389 --> 25:17.437
I could do A-levels.
I don't know.

25:18.559 --> 25:20.937
It's all jimmy Stone's fault.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.420
I went and left school
because of him, look where I ended up.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.190
What do you think?

25:26.025 --> 25:27.346
So where did you
meet this Doctor?

25:27.359 --> 25:29.862
I'm sorry,
was I talking about me for a second?

25:29.945 --> 25:32.198
'Cause I reckon it all
started back at the shop, am I right?

25:32.281 --> 25:34.454
- Was he something to do with that?
- No.

25:34.700 --> 25:35.747
Come on.

25:37.244 --> 25:38.291
Sort of.

25:39.788 --> 25:40.835
What was he doing there?

25:40.914 --> 25:43.588
I'm not going on about it,
Mickey, really I'm not.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.128
'Cause I know it
sounds daft, but,

25:46.879 --> 25:48.256
I don't think he's safe.

25:48.756 --> 25:51.635
- He's dangerous.
- But you can trust me, sweetheart.

25:51.717 --> 25:54.140
Babe, darling, sugar...

25:54.970 --> 25:58.395
You can tell me anything. Tell me about
the Doctor and what he's planning,

25:58.474 --> 26:00.226
and I can help you, Rose.

26:00.309 --> 26:02.061
That's all I want to do,
sweetheart.

26:02.144 --> 26:04.397
Darling, babe, babe,
sugar, sweetheart.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.153
What are you doing that for?

26:06.440 --> 26:08.818
- Your champagne.
- We didn't order any champagne.

26:08.942 --> 26:11.491
- Where's the Doctor?
- Madam, your champagne.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.498
It's not ours.
Mickey, what is it, what's wrong?

26:15.783 --> 26:18.002
I need to find out
how much he knows, so where is he?

26:18.285 --> 26:21.459
- Doesn't anybody want this champagne?
- Look, we didn't order...

26:22.664 --> 26:25.008
- Ah, got you.
- Don't mind me.

26:25.459 --> 26:27.006
I'm just toasting
the happy couple.

26:27.628 --> 26:28.675
On the house!

26:36.637 --> 26:37.684
Anyway!

26:49.858 --> 26:51.360
Don't think that's
gonna stop me.

26:55.030 --> 26:57.032
Everyone, out! Out now!

27:01.620 --> 27:04.043
Get out, get out, get out!

27:25.853 --> 27:28.572
Open the gate!
Use that tube thing! Come on!

27:28.897 --> 27:30.865
- Sonic screwdriver.
- Use it!

27:31.191 --> 27:33.034
Nah, tell you what,
let's go in here.

27:39.533 --> 27:41.410
You can't hide
inside a wooden box!

27:46.582 --> 27:48.084
He's gonna get us!

27:50.169 --> 27:51.216
Doctor!

28:18.238 --> 28:19.455
It's gonna follow us.

28:19.531 --> 28:22.284
The assembled hordes of Genghis Khan
couldn't get through that door.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.961
Believe me, they've tried!
Now, shut up a minute.

28:34.713 --> 28:39.469
You see, the arm
was too simple, but the head's perfect.

28:39.885 --> 28:43.310
I can use it to trace
the signal back to the original source.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.318
Right. Where do you
want to start?

28:47.434 --> 28:50.904
Um... The inside's bigger
than the outside.

28:51.146 --> 28:53.240
- Yes.
- It's alien.

28:53.607 --> 28:54.654
Yep.

28:55.984 --> 28:57.076
Are you alien?

28:57.986 --> 28:59.078
Yes.

29:00.822 --> 29:02.244
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.

29:02.950 --> 29:04.311
It's called the Tardis,
this thing.

29:04.326 --> 29:08.581
T-A-R-D-I-S, that's Time And
Relative Dimension In Space.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.668
That's okay. Culture shock.

29:12.793 --> 29:15.512
- Happens to the best of us.
- Did they kill him? Mickey?

29:16.296 --> 29:18.173
Did they kill Mickey?
Is he dead?

29:18.840 --> 29:20.808
Oh, I didn't think of that.

29:21.301 --> 29:24.475
He's my boyfriend.
You pulled off his head.

29:24.846 --> 29:27.019
They copied him,
and you didn't even think.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.193
- And now you're just gonna let him melt.
- Melt?

29:32.312 --> 29:34.485
Aw. no. no, no, no!

29:35.440 --> 29:38.193
- What are you doing?
- Following the signal. It's fading!

29:39.987 --> 29:41.284
Wait a minute.
I've got it.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.037
No. no, no, no, no, no, no!

29:46.493 --> 29:48.791
Almost there, almost there.

29:48.870 --> 29:50.292
Here we go!

29:54.209 --> 29:56.052
You can't go out there.
It's not safe!

30:01.049 --> 30:03.222
I lost the signal.
I got so close.

30:05.721 --> 30:07.564
We've moved.
Does it fly?

30:08.015 --> 30:10.814
It disappears there and reappears
here. You wouldn't understand.

30:10.892 --> 30:14.396
But if we're somewhere else, what about
that headless thing that's on the loose?

30:14.730 --> 30:17.199
Melted with the head.
Are you going to witter on all night?

30:18.025 --> 30:19.902
I'll have to tell his mother.

30:22.988 --> 30:25.741
Mickey... I'll have to
tell his mother he's dead,

30:25.824 --> 30:27.872
and you just went and
forgot him, again!

30:28.744 --> 30:29.996
You were right.
You are alien.

30:30.370 --> 30:33.169
- If I forgot some kid called Mickey...
- He's not a kid!

30:33.248 --> 30:36.001
It's because I'm trying
to save the life of every stupid ape

30:36.084 --> 30:38.257
blundering about
on this planet, all right?

30:38.378 --> 30:40.051
- All right?
- Yes, it is!

30:42.257 --> 30:44.601
If you are an alien, why do you
sound like you're from the north?

30:44.676 --> 30:46.394
Lots of planets have a north!

30:48.263 --> 30:51.608
What's a police
public call box?

30:53.769 --> 30:57.615
It's a telephone box,
from the 1950s. It's a disguise.

30:58.774 --> 31:03.280
Okay... And, this living
plastic, what's it got against us?

31:03.612 --> 31:07.116
Nothing. It loves you. You've got such
a good planet, lots of smoke and oil,

31:07.199 --> 31:10.248
plenty of toxins and dioxins
in the air. Perfect.

31:10.786 --> 31:12.959
Just what the Nestene
Consciousness needs.

31:13.080 --> 31:16.630
Its food stock was destroyed in the
war, its protein planets rotted.

31:16.708 --> 31:19.211
- So. Earth. Dinner.
- Any way of stopping it?

31:20.128 --> 31:21.300
Antiplastic.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.431
- Antiplastic?
- Antiplastic!

31:24.424 --> 31:25.664
But first, I've got to find it.

31:25.717 --> 31:28.061
How can you hide
something that big in a city this small?

31:28.136 --> 31:30.230
- Hold on, hide what?
- The transmitter.

31:30.972 --> 31:33.725
The Consciousness is controlling
every single piece of plastic,

31:33.975 --> 31:35.818
so it needs a transmitter
to boost the signal.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.737
- What does it look like?
- Like a transmitter!

31:37.813 --> 31:41.158
Round and massive, somewhere
slap-bang in the middle of London.

31:41.733 --> 31:46.239
A huge, metal, circular structure
like a dish, like a wheel, radial,

31:46.321 --> 31:47.413
close to where we're standing.

31:47.489 --> 31:48.786
It must be
completely invisible.

31:49.991 --> 31:51.083
What?

31:53.745 --> 31:54.792
What?

31:57.499 --> 31:58.546
What is it? What?

32:02.838 --> 32:03.930
Oh.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.141
Fantastic!

32:29.448 --> 32:31.576
Think of it.
Plastic all over the world,

32:31.658 --> 32:33.831
every artificial thing
waiting to be alive.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.165
The shop window dummies,
the phones, the wires, the cables.

32:37.247 --> 32:38.590
The breast implants.

32:38.665 --> 32:40.338
Still, we've found
the transmitter.

32:40.417 --> 32:42.886
The Consciousness must be
somewhere underneath.

32:46.006 --> 32:47.679
What about down here?

32:51.553 --> 32:52.930
Looks good to me.

33:37.307 --> 33:39.059
The Nestene Consciousness.

33:39.142 --> 33:42.567
That's it, inside the vat,
a living plastic creature.

33:42.646 --> 33:44.819
Well then, tip in
your Antiplastic and let's go.

33:45.315 --> 33:48.364
I'm not here to kill it.
I've got to give it a chance.

33:56.117 --> 34:00.122
I seek audience with the Nestene
Consciousness under peaceful contract

34:00.205 --> 34:03.675
according to Convention 15
of the Shadow Proclamation.

34:06.461 --> 34:08.554
Thank you. If I might have
permission to approach.

34:12.259 --> 34:13.306
Oh, my God.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.974
Mickey! It's me!
It's okay.

34:19.056 --> 34:21.185
- It's all right. It's all right.
- Shhh.

34:21.268 --> 34:24.237
That thing, down there...
The liquid, Rose, it can talk!

34:24.396 --> 34:25.693
Oh, you're stinking!

34:26.273 --> 34:27.525
Doctor, they kept him alive!

34:27.607 --> 34:31.532
Yeah, that was always a possibility,
keep him alive to maintain the copy.

34:31.610 --> 34:33.659
You knew that and never said?

34:33.822 --> 34:35.581
Can we keep the domestics
outside, thank you?

34:48.878 --> 34:50.471
Am I addressing
the Consciousness?

34:52.674 --> 34:54.597
Thank you.
If I might observe,

34:54.676 --> 34:59.147
you infiltrated this civilization by
means of warped, shunt technology.

34:59.222 --> 35:02.522
So, may I suggest, with the greatest
respect, that you shunt off?

35:04.686 --> 35:07.940
Oh, don't give me that!
It's an invasion, plain and simple.

35:08.023 --> 35:10.401
Don't talk about
constitutional rights.

35:12.485 --> 35:14.158
I am talking!

35:17.282 --> 35:18.659
This planet is just starting.

35:18.742 --> 35:22.292
These stupid little people
have only just learned how to walk.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.464
But they're capable
of so much more.

35:24.539 --> 35:28.009
I'm asking you,
on their behalf. Please, just go.

35:28.168 --> 35:29.215
Doctor!

35:35.008 --> 35:37.511
That was just insurance!
I wasn't gonna use it.

35:40.597 --> 35:42.895
I was not attacking you.
I'm here to help.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.193
I'm not your enemy,
I swear, I'm not.

35:48.063 --> 35:49.360
What do you mean?

35:50.482 --> 35:52.530
No, no, no! Honestly, no.

35:53.902 --> 35:54.949
Yes, that's my ship.

35:58.782 --> 35:59.829
That's not true!

35:59.908 --> 36:03.458
I should know, I was there.
I fought in the war. It wasn't my fault.

36:04.496 --> 36:07.295
I couldn't save your world.
I couldn't save any of them.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.007
- What's it doing?
- It's the Tardis.

36:11.836 --> 36:15.511
The Nestene's identified it
as superior technology. It's terrified!

36:15.799 --> 36:17.096
It's going to the final base.

36:18.218 --> 36:21.313
It's starting the invasion.
Get out, Rose! just leg it, now!

36:24.432 --> 36:27.231
- Mum?
- There you are! I was just gonna phone.

36:27.477 --> 36:30.151
You can get compensation,
I said so.

36:30.230 --> 36:32.699
I've got this document
thing off the police, don't thank me...

36:32.816 --> 36:35.444
- Where are you, Mum?
- I'm in town.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.621
Look, just go home!
Just go home right now.

36:37.696 --> 36:41.200
Darling, you're breaking up. I'm just
gonna do a bit of late night shopping

36:41.282 --> 36:43.080
I'll see you later. Ta-ra!

36:43.493 --> 36:44.995
Mum? Mum?

36:51.251 --> 36:54.130
It's the activation signal!
It's transmitting.

37:00.677 --> 37:02.304
It's the end of the world.

37:11.396 --> 37:12.739
There's no point
creating a spreadsheet

37:12.814 --> 37:14.612
if you're gonna spend
summer money in winter months.

37:14.691 --> 37:17.945
Oh, my God!
I thought they were dummies!

37:18.027 --> 37:19.529
I nearly had a heart attack.

37:47.015 --> 37:48.062
It's true.

37:48.141 --> 37:50.360
Everything I've read,
all those stories, it's all true!

37:59.402 --> 38:02.451
Get out, Rose! just get out!
Run!

38:03.281 --> 38:04.578
The stairs have gone.

38:10.205 --> 38:11.422
I haven't got the key.

38:14.501 --> 38:15.753
We're gonna die!

39:15.687 --> 39:18.236
Time Lord!

39:38.960 --> 39:40.052
Leave him!

39:47.802 --> 39:48.883
There's nothing you can do!

39:50.305 --> 39:51.807
I've got no A-levels.

39:53.141 --> 39:54.188
No job.

39:54.851 --> 39:55.898
No future.

39:57.478 --> 39:58.839
But I'll tell you what I have got.

39:59.606 --> 40:02.860
Jericho Street junior School
under-sevens gymnastics team.

40:03.610 --> 40:04.782
I got the bronze!

40:19.334 --> 40:20.506
Rose!

40:24.172 --> 40:25.799
Now we're in trouble!

42:04.939 --> 42:07.658
Rose, don't go out
of the house, it's not safe!

42:08.609 --> 42:11.704
There are these things,
they were shooting and...

42:11.988 --> 42:13.865
Hello? Hello?

42:18.661 --> 42:20.129
Fat lot of good you were!

42:23.332 --> 42:25.881
Nestene Consciousness?
Easy!

42:26.377 --> 42:28.880
You were useless in there!
You'd be dead if it wasn't for me.

42:29.464 --> 42:30.511
Yes, I would.

42:31.799 --> 42:32.891
Thank you.

42:33.718 --> 42:35.345
Right, then! I'll be off.

42:36.471 --> 42:38.189
Unless... I don't know.

42:39.307 --> 42:40.604
You could come with me.

42:42.101 --> 42:43.774
This box isn't just
a London-op, you know,

42:43.853 --> 42:44.900
it goes anywhere
in the universe.

42:44.979 --> 42:46.151
Free of charge.

42:46.230 --> 42:49.200
Don't! He's an alien.
He's a thing.

42:49.776 --> 42:50.993
He's not invited.

42:52.195 --> 42:53.242
What do you think?

42:55.448 --> 42:56.791
You could stay here.

42:56.866 --> 43:00.166
Fill your life with work
and food and sleep, or you could go...

43:01.412 --> 43:02.459
Anywhere.

43:03.331 --> 43:05.299
- Is it always this dangerous?
- Yeah.

43:07.460 --> 43:09.212
Yea h, I can't.

43:10.129 --> 43:12.302
I've gotta go and find my mum,

43:12.965 --> 43:15.593
and someone's gotta look after
this stupid lump, so...

43:18.346 --> 43:19.689
Okay.

43:21.307 --> 43:22.559
See you around.

43:56.008 --> 43:57.055
Come on, let's go.

43:58.386 --> 44:00.434
Come on. Come on.

44:17.780 --> 44:20.750
By the way, did I mention
it also travels in time?

44:26.205 --> 44:27.707
- Thanks.
- Thanks for what?

44:29.125 --> 44:30.172
Exactly.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.774
This is the year five billion,

44:45.516 --> 44:47.735
and this is the day...
Hold on...

44:50.980 --> 44:53.074
Welcome to
the end of the world.

44:53.482 --> 44:54.529
Who the hell are you?

44:55.234 --> 44:57.362
Oh, I'm the Doctor,
this is Rose Tyler.

44:57.445 --> 44:59.163
She's my plus one,
is that all right?

44:59.238 --> 45:01.411
Representing
the Forest of Cheam,

45:01.490 --> 45:05.666
we have Trees,
the Moxx of Balhoon,

45:05.745 --> 45:12.048
the Face of Boe, the last human,
the Lady Cassandra O'Brien.

45:12.376 --> 45:15.676
Oh, now, don't stare,
look how thin I am.

45:19.133 --> 45:20.333
That's not supposed to happen.
