What happens to this city?
Either there is ash or smoke.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.991
Why doesn't anyone say anything?

00:13.447 --> 00:16.222
Why do they tolerate
this smoke quietly?

00:16.517 --> 00:18.861
It's the limit to tolerance.

00:19.286 --> 00:22.563
Let's douse cigarettes and cigars.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.329

00:32.366 --> 00:34.243
You've to pay dearly for smoking.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.117
Everyone desires happiness.

00:43.744 --> 00:46.088
But at what cost?

00:47.047 --> 00:50.028
Smoking costs dearly.

00:51.885 --> 00:55.332
Smoking is injurious
to your health"

00:57.791 --> 01:00.067
"to your loves ones too.

Show him a good "settlement"!

07:41.261 --> 07:43.537
<i>I will 'settle' things

Piyush!

you asked for

08:04.250 --> 08:05.388
No, sir!

08:06.686 --> 08:09.599
I'm a college student, Sir.
It's my ﬁrst time here

Come out now kiddo,
or your dad gets the call

08:50.330 --> 08:52.139
Sir... I just want to use the toilet

You can shit in prison.
Your dad's phone is busy

08:55.802 --> 08:58.180
Please don't call my dad!
I beg you!

08:58.271 --> 09:00.080
<i>We will call him again, shortly</i>

09:04.110 --> 09:05.646
<i>Please let us go</i>

09:07.013 --> 09:08.617
Where are you from?
The local brothel?

09:09.249 --> 09:10.250
Face the camera

09:11.084 --> 09:12.688
No
- From Nepal?

09:14.387 --> 09:15.661
You've got it wrong

09:15.889 --> 09:17.800
Really? We've got it wrong?

09:18.658 --> 09:19.932
What are you waiting for?

09:20.527 --> 09:23.030
Break open the damn door!

09:23.763 --> 09:25.106
Come out now!

09:25.331 --> 09:27.277
Are you at a confessional?

09:27.400 --> 09:28.538
Knock it down!

09:34.474 --> 09:35.851
Sir!
_ Yes?

09:36.609 --> 09:38.145
Sir, look what he's done!

09:38.945 --> 09:40.049
What now?

09:44.117 --> 09:45.824
Hey Pandey!
Call the ambulance

09:46.252 --> 09:47.287
<i>Hurry UP</i>

09:52.058 --> 09:53.162
Careful !

10:13.279 --> 10:16.453
Get her dressed and
take her to the station

11:01.728 --> 11:03.139
Home already, son?

11:03.830 --> 11:05.468
Let me get you some water

11:05.698 --> 11:07.041
It's okay, I'll get it myself

11:07.300 --> 11:08.540
I'll get it

11:18.044 --> 11:19.819
Mother, it's time to prepare the stove

11:20.180 --> 11:23.650
Son, get holy ﬁre to ﬁre up the stove

11:25.218 --> 11:29.223
Wake Sikandar <i>up</i> too,
his shift starts soon

11:30.223 --> 11:31.167
Brother!

11:32.192 --> 11:33.170
Brother...

11:34.394 --> 11:35.566
Sikandar...

11:36.196 --> 11:37.334
Brother...

11:37.597 --> 11:39.543
Mother sent me to wake you up

11:40.333 --> 11:41.744
Wake up!

11:48.041 --> 11:55.858
Ram, the name of God,
is eternal truth!

12:11.998 --> 12:13.341
Dad, I'll light the stove
and be back

12:13.433 --> 12:15.845
And Sikandar?
- He's up... on his way here

12:28.481 --> 12:29.755
<i>Mr. Motilal...</i>

12:30.049 --> 12:31.221
Come, have some sweets

12:31.484 --> 12:32.895
<i>I can't leave my shop unattended</i>

12:32.986 --> 12:35.057
Come on! Nobody's going
to steal anything

12:35.154 --> 12:38.727
They've got sweets.
They're from the university, right?

12:38.825 --> 12:41.669
We're doing an anthropology project

12:42.562 --> 12:45.839
They want to know about our ghats,
enlighten them

12:45.999 --> 12:48.479
You're our ghat scholar!

12:48.534 --> 12:51.014
And you, our scholar on shady alleys!

12:51.070 --> 12:52.606
The sleazy ones at night!

12:54.340 --> 12:55.683
You're recording this?

12:55.908 --> 12:58.320
Yes sir, one tends to miss
details while writing

13:01.180 --> 13:02.557
History... Huh?

13:02.815 --> 13:07.958
Earlier, the banks of Mother
Ganges were a vast forest

13:08.287 --> 13:11.291
Cremation rituals began
in the Holy River

13:12.492 --> 13:15.302
So, various kings set up ghats

13:16.696 --> 13:19.040
Priests from all over
started settling here

13:19.432 --> 13:20.877
Ghats were assigned...

13:20.967 --> 13:24.505
according to state, caste...
and priests

13:25.171 --> 13:26.206
Did you understand?

13:26.506 --> 13:28.679
The ghat we're sitting on right now...

13:29.375 --> 13:31.218
is under dispute

13:31.311 --> 13:32.984
Like Kashmir
-Yes, like Kashmir

13:33.146 --> 13:35.456
The Maharasthrians claim
it to be theirs...

13:35.515 --> 13:38.519
as so do the Gujratis

13:40.153 --> 13:41.359
What do we do with this brat?

13:41.454 --> 13:45.300
Meet Jhonta. Ghat hero,
running for president...

13:45.358 --> 13:49.101
but ask him to get me customers
and he runs like an athlete!

13:49.195 --> 13:50.731
What happened?
- I was about to...

13:51.364 --> 13:53.344
Bring me my phone!
Hurry up! Now!

13:54.067 --> 13:57.310
The Scindia ghat, the one
right next to ours...

13:57.870 --> 14:00.510
I'll look for customers, master!

14:00.974 --> 14:04.615
Kids these days are so restless,
always on the run

14:05.445 --> 14:08.688
And so is this wretched phone

14:09.349 --> 14:11.124
Misery of modern times!

14:12.719 --> 14:13.629
Hello?

14:15.288 --> 14:16.460
Yes, speaking

14:19.158 --> 14:20.535
Look at the ingenuity of
these kids

14:20.860 --> 14:23.670
She changed into a
saree, all spruced up

14:24.130 --> 14:25.666
<i>They barely knew each
other...</i>

14:26.199 --> 14:27.473
<i>and just look ham!</i>

14:28.167 --> 14:29.202
What for?

14:32.638 --> 14:34.481
What did you tell us a while back?

14:35.174 --> 14:36.312
Say it out loud

14:36.642 --> 14:37.882
Enlighten your father

14:38.544 --> 14:39.750
<i>What was that phrase?</i>

14:39.846 --> 14:41.086
<i>"Curbing curiosity!"</i>

14:43.282 --> 14:45.057
lfl tip off ajournalist...

14:46.986 --> 14:49.057
it would make the front page

14:49.956 --> 14:50.957
What is this?

14:51.724 --> 14:53.499
A ﬁle of another department
on my desk?

14:54.694 --> 14:55.764
What shit!!

14:55.862 --> 14:59.036
Make the corrections and
get out of my face!

15:02.402 --> 15:03.506
What is your name again?

15:04.604 --> 15:05.548
Pathak

15:09.108 --> 15:10.519
Vidhyadhar Pathak

15:13.446 --> 15:16.017
I offer ritual services
at Nandeshwar ghat

15:18.418 --> 15:21.490
I used to be a Sanskrit
professor at the university

15:22.822 --> 15:25.462
Now I translate
- We'll call you in 3 days

15:26.926 --> 15:30.373
Pay the bail here, and take
your daughter for now

15:31.731 --> 15:35.372
Mr. Mishra,
what do you mean "for now"?

15:38.738 --> 15:40.684
If anything happens to the boy...

15:41.340 --> 15:43.479
it'll be a case of
abetment of suicide

15:45.545 --> 15:48.685
Court, media, journalists,
the whole shebang!

15:50.450 --> 15:52.555
No pleading!
Go pay the bail over there

15:53.152 --> 15:54.825
We're from
the same community

15:54.887 --> 15:56.366
Go pay the bail and
get out!

18:04.417 --> 18:09.696
Centrifugal force turned into centripetal
and people hit a deadlock there...

18:10.289 --> 18:12.030
so they started moving upwards

18:12.124 --> 18:15.936
And this led to the birth of
Civil Engineering

18:15.995 --> 18:17.099
Any question?

18:17.163 --> 18:18.642
No, sir!

18:21.667 --> 18:24.477
You can do this alone
- Come on, I need the support

18:29.175 --> 18:32.122
Add some ﬂavoured corn in it

18:32.178 --> 18:33.521
Some green chilies on the side

18:33.613 --> 18:34.648
Roast it properW!

18:34.947 --> 18:36.153
Like always

18:36.249 --> 18:38.058
Of course, madam!
Exactly the way you want it

18:38.150 --> 18:39.151
Pooja!

18:39.919 --> 18:40.954
Pooja!

18:41.020 --> 18:42.624
Happy Birthday to you!

18:48.728 --> 18:49.502
Please?

18:49.562 --> 18:50.700
Thank you

18:50.997 --> 18:51.975
Did you like it?

18:52.732 --> 18:54.143
So when is the birthday treat?

18:55.134 --> 18:57.011
How will she explain
this to her folks?

18:57.436 --> 18:58.141
As in?

18:58.204 --> 19:01.413
How will she explain who
gave this huge gift?

19:01.641 --> 19:03.518
I'm cool with any excuse

19:03.609 --> 19:05.646
Oh really?
Give this to me

19:05.945 --> 19:06.980
Here, take this back

19:07.079 --> 19:08.786
No, I got this as a gift

19:08.881 --> 19:11.828
Gifts are not supposed to be
returned. Come on now!

19:11.917 --> 19:13.419
But what will she tell her folks?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.227
Add more of these peanuts

19:15.288 --> 19:17.700
Say something
- She can say you've gifted it to her

19:18.224 --> 19:20.295
Like her folks are going
to believe that!

19:21.494 --> 19:24.600
Enough, don't roast it more!
A dash of green sauce too

19:24.664 --> 19:26.234
More of these chilli ﬂakes as well

19:26.499 --> 19:28.911
Last time you put very
little garlic in it

19:29.435 --> 19:31.437
Be generous this time
- Yes, madam

19:32.305 --> 19:35.184
Have you ever heard of a girl gifting a
teddy bear to another girl?

19:35.474 --> 19:36.714
Don't they?

19:37.710 --> 19:41.419
Nor have I ever seen a girl
fuss over a 5 rupee snack!

19:43.616 --> 19:44.959
<i>We need to go</i>

19:45.518 --> 19:46.826
Take this teddy with you

19:46.919 --> 19:48.990
No, thanks, we're in a hurry!
Let's go

19:53.259 --> 19:54.567
Good morning, master!

19:54.827 --> 19:56.500
I had an early bath today!

20:04.070 --> 20:06.311
You haven't shown up for 3 days

20:08.474 --> 20:09.976
<i>Mind your own business</i>

20:30.529 --> 20:31.701
ls your father home?

20:32.832 --> 20:34.106
He's gone to the ghat

20:35.034 --> 20:36.104
Call him

21:14.640 --> 21:16.085
The boy is dead

21:36.562 --> 21:38.405
Did you offer some tea?

21:40.332 --> 21:41.504
Have a seat

21:42.168 --> 21:43.511
Sorry, I'm late

21:48.474 --> 21:50.681
Well, the boy didn't survive

21:52.311 --> 21:55.485
They're doing an autopsy and
we'll have the report soon

21:57.116 --> 21:58.754
Here are the court papers

22:00.019 --> 22:00.997
Please ﬁll them up

22:01.053 --> 22:02.259
Wait...

22:04.623 --> 22:07.001
what do we have to do
with the court?

22:07.059 --> 22:09.198
It's a case of abetment of suicide

22:14.934 --> 22:16.379
But the boy...

22:18.270 --> 22:19.977
killed himself on your watch

22:20.706 --> 22:22.515
I mean... because of
police initimidation

22:28.514 --> 22:30.323
So now you are acting the Professor?

22:31.183 --> 22:32.719
Here's the thing...

22:32.985 --> 22:37.695
you can save your lecture to jerk off
your ghat customers

22:38.657 --> 22:39.829
Okay?

22:40.559 --> 22:42.163
You must have seen it on TV?

22:42.761 --> 22:45.867
The R.K Puram sex scandal,
Jammu and Kashmir sex scandal

22:46.065 --> 22:49.308
<i>Your</i> daughter <i>is</i> now part of
a big sex scandal!

22:51.170 --> 22:53.980
Sir, please suggest a way out

23:01.781 --> 23:03.317
How much do you earn?

23:07.353 --> 23:09.833
Around 8 to 10 thousand rupees

23:10.856 --> 23:12.494
She earns as well, right?

23:14.193 --> 23:16.195
Yes... at a computer
coaching institute

23:17.630 --> 23:19.803
I won't beat around the bush

23:22.801 --> 23:24.041
Abetment...

23:25.537 --> 23:28.518
media, court...
I can handle all of that

23:28.841 --> 23:30.650
But you'll have to
make arrangements

23:30.709 --> 23:34.020
3 lakh rupees.
I'm giving you 3 months

23:35.748 --> 23:37.887
Sir, you've got us wrong

23:38.651 --> 23:40.722
We're principled people

23:41.186 --> 23:45.032
We can hardly manage 50,000 rupees!

23:45.090 --> 23:47.001
From now on...

23:47.326 --> 23:48.464
never ever...

23:48.994 --> 23:51.201
ever... negotiate with me

23:52.665 --> 23:54.611
Am I selling you a bloody
soap?!

23:59.305 --> 24:01.911
I'm hereto save your honour

24:06.812 --> 24:09.816
I have your daughter's sex
scandal video on my phone

24:10.249 --> 24:16.291
One upload and the whole city
will get off on your daughter!

24:18.791 --> 24:21.271
Arrange 1 lakh Rupees in two days

24:22.962 --> 24:24.635
Don't just nod like a horse!

24:25.631 --> 24:26.735
What will you do?

24:28.934 --> 24:30.936
Arrange 1 lakh Rupees
in two days

24:31.870 --> 24:33.178
And, after 2 months?

24:35.174 --> 24:36.676
2 lakh Rupees

24:37.042 --> 24:38.953
ls the math really that hard?

24:59.665 --> 25:00.905
Where to Madam?

25:02.935 --> 25:05.347
To the cremation ghat
- It's forbidden for women

25:08.040 --> 25:10.646
Hit the skull hard, 5 times

25:23.789 --> 25:26.030
Deepak, give him a hand

25:28.027 --> 25:29.938
Piyush! My son!

25:29.995 --> 25:34.705
Harder! Smash the skull
to release the soul!

25:46.045 --> 25:48.047
How many more days
left in college?

25:49.381 --> 25:51.224
Two more months, Dad

25:52.084 --> 25:54.086
Then exams and placements!

25:54.286 --> 25:56.766
\Nhat?
- I mean job placements

25:57.156 --> 25:59.602
Don't you need to
pay something to get ajob?

25:59.992 --> 26:01.437
Not anymore, Mother

26:01.827 --> 26:03.898
The Railway and Electric companies...

26:03.962 --> 26:05.270
hire on merit

26:16.775 --> 26:19.779
Instead of supervising the ash cleaning,
you're feasting here?

26:20.112 --> 26:22.183
What if the boys steal the
silver?

26:22.481 --> 26:23.653
Uncle Shambhu is supervising it

26:23.916 --> 26:25.418
Shambu is a pothead!

26:25.484 --> 26:27.327
So? Am I not even
supposed to eat?

26:37.830 --> 26:39.503
How much will the job pay?

26:40.799 --> 26:42.801
They will let me know
after the interview

26:43.469 --> 26:44.971
Great! Get out of this place

26:47.373 --> 26:49.819
The sooner, the better

26:50.275 --> 26:54.382
Otherwise, even your life will
end up torching bodies

27:00.119 --> 27:01.257
Bread!

27:09.261 --> 27:11.935
Look what I found,
I think it's silver!

27:11.997 --> 27:12.907
Show me!

27:12.965 --> 27:15.775
<i>Throw it you fool. It's aluminium</i>

27:52.171 --> 27:54.082
Will you ever explain yourself?

27:57.042 --> 27:59.022
I met him at the
coaching centre

28:00.612 --> 28:02.683
I used to type out his thesis...

28:02.781 --> 28:05.819
and we became friends

28:11.156 --> 28:12.260
That's all?

28:14.526 --> 28:18.099
Yes, I felt nice talking to him

28:21.467 --> 28:24.448
Did you even think twice
before doing it?

28:25.404 --> 28:27.907
Even once?

28:28.607 --> 28:29.711
Did you?

28:30.242 --> 28:31.186
Answer me!

28:36.915 --> 28:37.950
What?

28:44.690 --> 28:46.533
Cat got your tongue?
- I don't know

28:51.530 --> 28:53.032
A boy just killed himself

28:54.266 --> 28:56.268
A ransom of 3 lakhs on our heads

28:56.835 --> 28:58.940
ljust broke my 1 lakh Rupees
ﬁxed deposit

28:59.304 --> 29:01.250
You're one step away from jail...

29:02.007 --> 29:03.918
and you say "l don't know"

29:16.121 --> 29:17.759
I ﬁshed out 26 Rupees

29:19.458 --> 29:21.699
Please, let me be part
of the competition

29:23.795 --> 29:25.900
Are you actually asking me
to let you gamble?

29:25.964 --> 29:26.908
It's not gambling!

29:26.965 --> 29:29.309
It's sport and
I have become a pro at it

29:29.835 --> 29:31.781
Why are you acting so smart?

29:32.504 --> 29:34.313
Today I will play, no matter what

29:34.473 --> 29:37.920
Why don't you shut up
and do some work!

29:37.976 --> 29:40.047
Got screwed over by a bull or what?

29:43.015 --> 29:45.120
Pooja looks so pretty with the teddy

29:45.350 --> 29:46.852
Cute, isn't she?

29:47.352 --> 29:49.832
Can you ask
for her friend's name?

29:50.923 --> 29:52.129
How would I ask?

29:52.190 --> 29:56.969
"My friend has a crush
on your poetry-reading friend...

29:57.029 --> 30:00.738
give me her name
so he can ask her out?"

30:00.966 --> 30:02.946
Ok, how about we send
her a written request?

30:03.001 --> 30:04.810
Deepak is getting
emotional about her

30:05.470 --> 30:06.676
Like they say...

30:06.738 --> 30:08.217
"Shake the mango all night,

30:08.307 --> 30:10.685
it'll only fall off the tree
when it's time is ripe"

30:10.742 --> 30:12.153
What is that noise there?

30:14.746 --> 30:15.816
Okay, listen...

30:16.048 --> 30:17.356
do you remember what
she looks like?

30:20.085 --> 30:21.496
Sure?
- Yes

30:23.855 --> 30:24.890
Okay

30:25.190 --> 30:27.534
This is her college group page.
She's got to be here

30:27.893 --> 30:31.238
Won't you ﬁnd her
in Pooja's album?

30:31.697 --> 30:34.303
Of course! She'll be in
Pooja's friend list

30:35.467 --> 30:36.537
ls that her?

30:37.302 --> 30:38.178
No

30:38.237 --> 30:40.308
There... there... That's her!

30:42.374 --> 30:43.717
Shaalu Gupta

30:43.976 --> 30:45.546
Gupta family, eh?

30:46.044 --> 30:46.988
Awesome, dude!

30:47.045 --> 30:51.118
Now create your Facebook account
and let the ﬁreworks begin!

30:53.218 --> 30:55.061
I mean send her
a friend request

30:55.587 --> 30:56.759
Should we?

30:58.190 --> 30:59.134
Yeah

30:59.491 --> 31:04.873
Come one, come all, make big money!
Here's the super competition!

31:04.963 --> 31:09.935
In half an hour, increase your gain!
10 rupees turns to 50! 50 turns to 200!

31:10.001 --> 31:11.947
Now listen to the rules

31:12.004 --> 31:16.180
These kids will dive in
and bring out coins!

31:16.375 --> 31:19.549
Bet on the boy you think
will get the most coins

31:19.645 --> 31:22.319
Great! We have your 20 Rupees on Lokua

31:22.381 --> 31:24.588
Don't think twice!
Just place your bets!

31:24.850 --> 31:27.387
20 Rupees on Netwa

31:28.186 --> 31:30.291
The competition is about to begin!

31:31.490 --> 31:34.061
1... 2...

31:40.098 --> 31:44.672
Now let's see who
gets the most coins!

31:45.103 --> 31:48.380
<i>Lokua has 3 coins!</i>

31:48.473 --> 31:51.977
Netwa, hurry! Faster!
- Babua's got only one coin this time

31:52.043 --> 31:56.389
Let's see who's winning...
Munna has 6 coins in one dive

31:56.481 --> 31:57.721
Hold your breath folks

31:57.783 --> 32:01.128
Please let me join in!
- No, just watch

32:03.522 --> 32:09.495
Those who've bet on Netwa,
will get three times their money!

33:01.113 --> 33:01.818
Hello?

33:01.913 --> 33:02.857
<i>Hello Devi?</i>

33:03.648 --> 33:04.490
Yes?

33:05.183 --> 33:07.686
Where were you hiding
your phone all this while?

33:08.120 --> 33:09.690
<i>You think l am an idiot?</i>

33:10.989 --> 33:13.128
<i>I</i> know what dirty
business you've been up to

33:13.792 --> 33:15.032
<i>Bloody witch...</i>

33:46.658 --> 33:49.332
Move!

34:14.853 --> 34:15.853
Hey!

34:16.154 --> 34:17.462
What are you doing here?!

34:17.522 --> 34:18.694
Who let you in?

34:19.257 --> 34:20.860
I came hereto collect my stuff...

34:21.126 --> 34:24.072
and if you make those ﬁlthy calls again,
I'll thrash the hell out of you!

34:24.161 --> 34:25.664
He was our top student!

34:25.730 --> 34:26.833
Weren't you ashamed to do it?

34:26.931 --> 34:28.878
Whatever it was, we both
were equally involved

34:28.967 --> 34:30.969
But he was the only one to die

34:36.708 --> 34:38.380
Sikandar!

34:38.743 --> 34:41.451
Thrust the leg into the
pyre, you idiot!

34:45.016 --> 34:46.222
Sikandar!

34:46.318 --> 34:48.059
Looks like the old man is drunk

34:49.888 --> 34:51.868
Pour me another drink
‘King of the Dams‘!

34:52.056 --> 34:53.730
One more for your health!

34:59.030 --> 35:00.441
Do I look like a king to you?

35:00.765 --> 35:04.178
Come on! There are only
two kings in Banaras!

35:04.803 --> 35:07.807
One is Kashi Naresh and
the other is the Dom king

35:08.240 --> 35:09.913
One on that side...

35:09.975 --> 35:11.249
and one on this side

35:11.977 --> 35:13.684
Look at that miserable Shambu

35:15.914 --> 35:18.258
How rnany 'bonus days' in a year?

35:19.317 --> 35:21.297
Hey! Shambu!

35:21.520 --> 35:22.965
Yes, sir!

35:23.021 --> 35:25.729
Once every 10 years

35:26.124 --> 35:29.128
Sharnbhu gets a 'bonus day'
every 10 years!

35:30.328 --> 35:31.568
Meaning?

35:32.797 --> 35:34.208
That day...

35:35.167 --> 35:38.979
he gets all the money
from every cremation here

35:41.373 --> 35:42.681
Shambu's father...

35:44.042 --> 35:47.387
got his 'bonus day' once in a year

35:48.046 --> 35:50.822
Overjoyed by that,
he had ten children

35:51.449 --> 35:52.757
The 'bonus day' got split

35:56.288 --> 35:58.598
Since the father
had one day in a year...

35:59.090 --> 36:02.469
Sharnbhu inherited
a tenth of the 'bonus day'

36:02.928 --> 36:07.274
Now he has one every 10 years

36:09.100 --> 36:11.979
\N'hen is your next 'bonus day', Sharnbu'?

36:12.637 --> 36:14.344
Never again

36:14.706 --> 36:17.778
I sold my rights to Lala

36:17.976 --> 36:21.185
<i>He gave me 1 Iakh Rupees for it</i>

36:21.613 --> 36:24.253
<i>I'll live the rest of my life off alms</i>

36:24.316 --> 36:26.353
lfl sell rny 'bonus day'...

36:26.952 --> 36:28.693
I'll get over 10 lakh Rupees.
Right, lala?

36:28.954 --> 36:30.956
As if you are ever going
to sell it to me

36:31.189 --> 36:32.327
Should we sell?

36:32.424 --> 36:34.370
<i>Asking your ignorant son?</i>

36:34.459 --> 36:36.632
He has nothing to do with
our cremation ghat!

36:36.962 --> 36:38.999
He's nothing but an educated fool!

36:39.064 --> 36:40.941
You're insulting my son?

36:40.999 --> 36:42.535
I'll never sell rny 'bonus day' to you!

36:42.667 --> 36:44.943
As if you'd ever think to do so!

36:47.005 --> 36:50.748
Father, I need some money.
For the Durga Puja Carnival

36:50.976 --> 36:52.956
There, in my shirt

36:53.445 --> 36:54.981
May I take 300 Rupees?

36:55.347 --> 36:56.883
Take as much as you want

36:57.449 --> 36:59.156
You're the only one!

37:07.258 --> 37:11.104
Are you going to the Durga puja
carnival tonight?

37:45.630 --> 37:46.870
20 rupees

37:56.441 --> 37:58.216
Put the watch in the hat

37:58.309 --> 38:00.516
Easy! Right inside

38:00.612 --> 38:02.250
Now it's inside

38:02.314 --> 38:04.590
Now blow into the hat

38:05.684 --> 38:07.391
The watch has...

38:08.086 --> 38:09.759
vanished!

38:11.222 --> 38:13.668
The watch will re-appear...

38:13.758 --> 38:14.896
in someone's pocket

38:14.959 --> 38:17.303
He has it!

38:17.596 --> 38:19.132
Man in the red shirt!

38:19.597 --> 38:21.008
Check your pockets

38:21.299 --> 38:23.301
He found the watch

38:23.401 --> 38:25.608
Come on stage, young man!

38:27.972 --> 38:29.849
Your name?
- Deepak

38:47.792 --> 38:51.467
I'll never smoke again.
Yesterday, my friends forced me to

40:22.020 --> 40:25.399
I deserve at least 12,000 a month
with my qualiﬁcations

40:25.490 --> 40:27.970
Don't negotiate.
He was my best student

40:28.293 --> 40:30.830
Professor taught us
till 10th grade

40:30.995 --> 40:34.670
It's thanks to him
that we are what we are

40:34.966 --> 40:36.502
Tea, please

40:36.568 --> 40:38.570
No thank you, I have to go...

40:38.670 --> 40:41.014
and ﬁnish the book translation

40:41.072 --> 40:43.780
Glass of water?
From the earthenware pot

40:45.777 --> 40:47.779
I received your CV by e-mail

40:48.479 --> 40:49.617
Unfortunately...

40:49.881 --> 40:52.225
we have no positions open
for instructors

40:52.417 --> 40:53.987
We need a receptionist

40:54.252 --> 40:57.529
Welcoming and counseling
new students

40:57.722 --> 41:01.295
<i>Some database work, paid extra</i>

41:01.359 --> 41:03.498
Comes to 5.5K a month

41:03.561 --> 41:05.700
Perfect!

41:05.797 --> 41:07.003
She'll start tomorrow

41:07.432 --> 41:09.537
Thank you so much, Sanjay!
- Oh! Come on, Sir

41:09.634 --> 41:11.011
<i>It's the least l could do</i>

41:11.069 --> 41:12.878
I must take this call

41:12.971 --> 41:16.043
Please, have some water.
The new Earthenware pot...

41:16.140 --> 41:18.313
<i>makes the water taste very sweet!</i>

41:24.382 --> 41:25.759
He meant 5,500 rupees only

41:27.185 --> 41:29.461
What he meant was a lot of
respect for your father

41:34.058 --> 41:35.366
Thank you

41:42.367 --> 41:44.847
So you're studying

Just music?

42:10.695 --> 42:12.368
I also like poetry a lot!

42:12.463 --> 42:13.965
Poetry?
- Yes

Bashir Badr...

Akbar Allahabadi...

42:17.135 --> 42:18.307
Mirza Ghalib...

42:18.636 --> 42:21.344
You must have at least
heard of Ghalib's name?

42:22.173 --> 42:23.379
Yeah

42:59.077 --> 43:00.317
By the way,"-

43:00.511 --> 43:05.859
if you're ever in trouble,
let me know

43:08.052 --> 43:09.531
What will you do?

43:10.822 --> 43:11.425
Ill...

43:11.489 --> 43:13.264
sort things out for you...

43:13.658 --> 43:15.433
if anyone bothers you...

43:15.493 --> 43:17.666
teases you or makes you cry

43:18.029 --> 43:20.635
There are lots of nasty boys
around here

43:20.698 --> 43:21.938
Okay

43:24.268 --> 43:25.440
What if...

43:27.972 --> 43:29.645
you make me cry?

43:30.441 --> 43:32.079
Me? No... Why?

43:38.449 --> 43:40.656
I'd sort that out for you too

43:43.021 --> 43:46.002
Write the student's name here,
in capital letters

43:46.057 --> 43:49.869
This is our prospectus
with a complimentary CD

43:49.961 --> 43:51.463
All the information is in here

43:51.529 --> 43:54.533

43:54.599 --> 43:56.203
Thank you
- Thank you

44:05.543 --> 44:07.284
You're quite a sweet talker!

44:09.147 --> 44:10.524
ls this your ﬁrst job?

44:12.150 --> 44:13.322
No

44:15.353 --> 44:16.991
What happened to the previous job?

44:18.456 --> 44:19.867
I didn't like the job

44:21.659 --> 44:23.935
I know exactly where
your previous job was

44:31.569 --> 44:33.708
Enter our "Match the Face" contest!

44:33.805 --> 44:37.150

45:58.222 --> 46:00.259

Ok, relax

46:06.130 --> 46:07.006
Let's go

46:07.899 --> 46:08.707
Run along!

46:15.239 --> 46:18.049
Ladies and gentlemen,
the competition has begun!

46:18.142 --> 46:20.622
Let's see who ﬁnds the most coins

46:30.321 --> 46:32.130
Put the coins here

46:33.691 --> 46:35.136
Dive over there!

46:41.432 --> 46:42.672
20 rupees on Jhonta?

46:42.733 --> 46:43.803
How much?

46:44.502 --> 46:46.209
Over here!

46:52.076 --> 46:53.487
Piyush Agarwal

46:54.011 --> 46:55.684
Hometown: Allahabad?

47:00.451 --> 47:01.794
He passed away

47:02.420 --> 47:04.263
Something tragic happened to him

47:05.523 --> 47:06.900
I read about it

47:09.760 --> 47:12.240
I'm from his coaching centre

47:12.530 --> 47:14.510
We have some ﬁles
that belonged to him

47:14.599 --> 47:17.102
And he owed us some money

47:17.902 --> 47:20.314
He was to return some
books as well, so...

47:22.540 --> 47:24.247
could I have his address please?

47:25.142 --> 47:27.122
Come out now! The game's over

47:27.178 --> 47:29.522
Who has the most coins?

47:30.281 --> 47:31.521
Hey, Munna!

47:31.616 --> 47:33.425
Who is the winner?

47:33.684 --> 47:35.027
Jhonta!

47:36.787 --> 47:38.425
I told you I would win

47:38.489 --> 47:40.730
<i>Jhoma has won 980 Rupees</i>

47:40.825 --> 47:42.532
You were great!

47:54.939 --> 47:56.145
<i>Hello?</i>

48:03.748 --> 48:09.699
<i>Hide these</i> stars <i>safely in my eyes,
the night</i> will <i>be</i> along <i>one</i>

48:10.655 --> 48:18.164
Wanderers like us, will meet somewhere,
perhaps in the morning light

48:20.298 --> 48:21.038
Then?

48:21.132 --> 48:22.167
"And then?"

48:22.533 --> 48:24.410
That was it

48:24.468 --> 48:28.917
Sorry, I didn't get it. I mean
I got some of it... it was terriﬁc!

48:29.473 --> 48:31.146
You're such a dumbo!

48:33.778 --> 48:34.848
And very cute!

48:35.479 --> 48:36.549
What did you just say?

48:36.647 --> 48:37.921
I didn't say anything

48:38.949 --> 48:40.189
But I heard that!

48:40.351 --> 48:43.264
If I recite Chakbast, you'll faint!

48:46.257 --> 48:49.359
Your birthday's soon, right?
I saw on Facebook

48:49.360 --> 48:50.304
Really?

48:50.661 --> 48:52.698
Facebook didn't tell you everything

48:53.264 --> 48:54.140
What?

48:54.498 --> 48:55.704
A Picnic!

48:56.367 --> 48:57.209
<i>Shaalu?</i>

48:58.436 --> 49:01.144
Mom's calling. We'll talk later

49:01.238 --> 49:01.943
Hold on...

49:02.006 --> 49:03.610
What is it?

49:04.475 --> 49:07.888
Please call me by my name

49:10.214 --> 49:12.592
Only if you memorize two poems...

49:12.950 --> 49:15.226
then I'll decide.
I have to go now

49:15.386 --> 49:15.989
Hello?

49:16.087 --> 49:17.395
Bye

49:23.761 --> 49:25.763
<i>A poem by Dushyam Kumar</i>

49:26.263 --> 49:28.675
<i>You move like the misty morning train</i>

49:28.766 --> 49:31.246
<i>I tremble like a bridge in the rain</i>

49:31.636 --> 49:33.707
<i>In the deep jungle of your gaze</i>

49:34.305 --> 49:36.512
<i>I lose my way, no trail to blaze</i>

49:37.007 --> 49:38.611
<i>Who is it?</i>

49:39.443 --> 49:41.650
May I speak with Ramdhari Agarwal?

49:41.712 --> 49:44.625
<i>Speaking. Who is this?</i>

49:45.716 --> 49:47.923
I... I...

49:49.453 --> 49:51.865
<i>What do you want? Hello?</i>

49:52.189 --> 49:54.829
I'm calling from Kashi
Co-operative bank

49:54.925 --> 49:56.996
We have a new scheme

49:57.061 --> 49:59.667
<i>l don't need anything, thank you!</i>

50:26.290 --> 50:28.463
I'll come straight to the point

50:30.094 --> 50:31.505
Will you sleep with me?

50:31.962 --> 50:32.997
<i>Tell me</i>

50:34.165 --> 50:35.610
I won't tell anyone

50:36.667 --> 50:38.374
You had sex with him too, right?

50:41.005 --> 50:43.576
Why are you worried about your wife?
This is good quality stuff

50:43.674 --> 50:46.348
It's too expensive
- It is not!

50:46.777 --> 50:49.519
Let me give you a discount

50:50.181 --> 50:54.596
Think it over
and come back later, okay?

50:59.724 --> 51:01.260
I quit my jqb

51:03.861 --> 51:04.931
<i>Pathak...</i>

51:04.995 --> 51:07.134
<i>your daughter hasn't visited
for</i> ages

51:07.431 --> 51:08.375
Good morning

51:12.670 --> 51:14.047
Get out of here

51:15.740 --> 51:16.844
What?

51:17.975 --> 51:19.750
Should I drown myself with shame?

51:20.711 --> 51:21.849
Go away

51:27.017 --> 51:28.758
Madam just quit her job!

51:29.553 --> 51:32.033
What were you thinking?

51:32.456 --> 51:33.298
Nothing

51:33.357 --> 51:36.236
"Nothing", "l don't know",
that's all you know!

51:37.194 --> 51:38.867
Was I ever hard on you?

51:39.697 --> 51:42.735
I've always been liberal...
raised you like a boy

51:43.167 --> 51:45.841
What did I do to deserve
such a scandal?

51:45.903 --> 51:47.314
I haven't created any scandal

51:47.371 --> 51:48.748
Then what is this?

51:50.307 --> 51:52.719
All this scampering for loose
change! What is this?

51:52.776 --> 51:54.585
On the ghat, in the streets...

51:54.679 --> 51:58.752
I'm constantly afraid someone
will ask about you! What is this?

51:58.849 --> 52:00.123
That's your fear

52:00.451 --> 52:03.295
Hence, I've decided
not to live here anymore

52:04.722 --> 52:06.963
The smaller the city, the
narrower the world-view

52:07.024 --> 52:09.937
After all this, you're still living
in this house with dignity...

52:09.994 --> 52:10.995
And my world-view is narrow?
- Wow!

52:11.061 --> 52:12.802
How considerate of you, Father!

52:13.497 --> 52:15.306
Should I start paying rent as well?

52:17.935 --> 52:18.845
Look at me

52:19.069 --> 52:20.377
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

52:20.471 --> 52:21.973
Why are you taking revenge?

52:22.039 --> 52:23.814
Revenge for what?

52:23.874 --> 52:25.012
For Mother!

52:30.714 --> 52:33.285
You don't even remember
what she looked like

52:33.350 --> 52:34.693
You were just 6 years old

52:35.186 --> 52:38.099
Are 6 year-olds blind?

52:38.722 --> 52:41.066
I took her to the hospital, didn't l?

52:41.158 --> 52:45.607
For 2 days, she begged you
to take her, but you didn't

52:45.696 --> 52:47.300
Your students mattered more

52:47.464 --> 52:48.738
<i>You did nothing!</i>

52:48.832 --> 52:51.711
I thought it was just fever.
I messed up

52:52.569 --> 52:54.310
But I never neglected you, did l?

52:54.371 --> 52:56.874
I left my job at the university,
for your sake!

52:56.974 --> 53:00.649
I ended up selling books
on the ghat, for your sake!

53:00.711 --> 53:01.849
You think I killed your mother?

53:01.946 --> 53:04.517
So do you think I killed that boy?

53:06.550 --> 53:08.154
Answer me?

53:09.420 --> 53:11.161
He killed himself!

53:15.326 --> 53:18.466
You're crazy.
You're getting confused

53:22.299 --> 53:23.835
I'm not getting confused

53:25.803 --> 53:27.874
I will defend my honor

53:29.473 --> 53:30.816
I won't go to prison

53:31.041 --> 53:33.214
You have decided
everything for yourself!

53:33.310 --> 53:35.483
I'm the fool who arranges the money

53:36.046 --> 53:37.821
I'll arrange the ransom too

53:38.382 --> 53:40.988
Next you'll say you don't even
need a father

53:42.186 --> 53:43.597
Do what you feel like

53:45.322 --> 53:47.461
<i>I tremble like a bridge in the rain</i>

53:48.192 --> 53:50.468
<i>In the deep jungle of your gaze</i>

53:51.061 --> 53:52.870
<i>I lose my way, no trail to blaze</i>

53:53.731 --> 53:56.507
<i>I never thought about it.</i>
I <i>like</i> them <i>all</i>

53:57.067 --> 53:59.911
<i>How can you like all the seasons?</i>

54:00.170 --> 54:02.241
<i>l like the monsoons!</i>

54:11.715 --> 54:13.422
You recorded her voice?

54:13.484 --> 54:14.258
Brilliant!

54:14.318 --> 54:16.127
First, I recorded it on my phone...

54:16.186 --> 54:18.257
then I cued songs
based on her words

54:18.322 --> 54:21.667
Well done! The student
has become the master!

54:22.660 --> 54:24.037
That's a smart gift, bro!

54:26.130 --> 54:27.939
Dude, she's from an upper-caste

54:28.465 --> 54:30.069
Don't get too emotional about her

54:30.167 --> 54:31.976
Does she know
you're from a lower caste?

54:36.140 --> 54:38.586
Let her know about it,
then do as you please

54:38.842 --> 54:40.844
Not everyone is progressive

54:40.944 --> 54:43.823
Ok, I'll tell her later

54:46.650 --> 54:48.652
Come on!
There's lot of time for that

54:48.719 --> 54:50.995
When he gets ajob,
none of this will matter

54:51.055 --> 54:53.501
Give him your motorbike keys
- Why?

54:53.857 --> 54:55.530
He has one more surprise for her

54:55.693 --> 54:58.003
Give the keys!
He'll pay you for the fuel

54:59.196 --> 55:00.334
First word

55:01.098 --> 55:02.304
Plant?

55:03.000 --> 55:03.535
Lamp?

55:03.634 --> 55:04.704
Bowl!

55:18.015 --> 55:19.255
DeePak!

55:19.316 --> 55:21.262
It's a ﬂower, not Deepak

55:21.318 --> 55:22.422
DeePak!

55:50.080 --> 55:51.184
Where to?

55:51.949 --> 55:53.485
Wherever you want

55:54.084 --> 55:55.324
Get on

55:56.754 --> 55:57.596
Your bag?

55:57.688 --> 55:58.598
Sorry!

56:00.124 --> 56:02.104
Shall I sit?
- Yes, sure

56:05.763 --> 56:08.141
You know what we
boys call your bus?

56:08.298 --> 56:09.140
What?

56:09.333 --> 56:10.641
Chick-Wagon!

56:16.106 --> 56:17.449
<i>What is this?</i>

56:20.110 --> 56:21.680
ls it an eraser?
-Yes

56:24.348 --> 56:27.124
You have ﬁnal year
Civil Engineering books?

56:27.184 --> 56:28.185
No sir

56:29.319 --> 56:31.026
Concrete design?
- No sir

56:31.121 --> 56:32.794
Structure analysis?
- No sir

56:33.190 --> 56:34.669
You got all your books?

56:35.993 --> 56:37.666
Pack these please!

56:51.508 --> 56:53.283
You never told me where you live

57:00.017 --> 57:01.121
You know Bhelupur?

57:01.218 --> 57:03.664
Bhelupur?
- Right after that

57:03.954 --> 57:05.797
My friend Prerna lives there

57:07.024 --> 57:09.470
I'll say I'm going there and
I'll visit you

57:09.526 --> 57:11.233
Great idea, right?

57:14.164 --> 57:15.643
You'll come to my house?

57:16.166 --> 57:19.170
I mean... your parents won't mind?

57:21.338 --> 57:22.840
If you don't feel like it, I won't

57:22.940 --> 57:26.149
No, I didn't mean that

57:31.782 --> 57:33.955
Hey, hold this for a second

57:38.155 --> 57:39.828
This is your birthday gift

57:44.061 --> 57:45.165
Put them on

57:53.337 --> 57:54.509
ls it audible?

57:58.675 --> 57:59.813
Thank you

58:38.315 --> 58:40.022
Have you ever been to Sangam?

58:41.718 --> 58:43.288
I come here often

58:50.927 --> 58:54.306
In few days we'll be off on
a pilgrimage in a bus

58:54.364 --> 58:57.538
All of us: uncle, aunt,
grandpa, and grandma

58:58.569 --> 58:59.707
Will you come along?

59:00.871 --> 59:02.373
\Nhere?
- With us

59:02.439 --> 59:03.474
With yqu?

59:08.312 --> 59:10.087
I'll have to think about it

59:30.300 --> 59:31.301
What is it?

59:31.635 --> 59:34.172
You must be the youngest
in your family, right?

59:35.605 --> 59:37.915
Right! How did you know?

59:39.476 --> 59:42.286
The youngest are always chatterboxes

59:45.615 --> 59:48.459
That hurts! Your hand is
like a hammer!

59:48.519 --> 59:49.793
It's the ring

59:51.922 --> 59:54.266
My uncle gave it to me
when I was a kid

59:54.791 --> 59:56.293
It's stuck now

59:56.493 --> 59:57.995
My ﬁngers grew...

59:58.128 --> 59:59.937
the ring stayed the same

59:59.997 --> 01:00:03.740
Everybody loves me
because I'm the youngest

01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:08.945
What is it?

01:00:09.873 --> 01:00:11.181
I don't know

01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:29.730
You're the youngest, right?
So I kissed you

01:01:41.698 --> 01:01:43.371
Shaalu

01:01:45.569 --> 01:01:47.173
Will you marry me?

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:53.046
I don't know

01:01:56.213 --> 01:01:57.851
Will your folks agree?

01:01:59.016 --> 01:02:00.256
I don't know

01:02:01.351 --> 01:02:02.625
You want to meet them?

01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:04.427
Will you introduce me?

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:07.560
You won't tell me where you live...

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:10.263
but you are in a hurry to
come to my place?

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.825
Shall I go?
- You stay near by?

01:02:37.187 --> 01:02:40.396
Around the corner,
the house on the left

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:43.903
Where's your house?

01:02:44.828 --> 01:02:47.035
You said it was near Belupur...

01:02:47.397 --> 01:02:48.705
Shivala?

01:02:51.001 --> 01:02:52.537
Kamacha!

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:54.576
Ok, I got it

01:02:54.838 --> 01:02:56.875
Durgakund, right?
- Why?

01:02:57.774 --> 01:02:58.980
What's bothering you?

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:04.855
I told you I stay near Bhelupur.
You have nothing else to talk about?

01:03:05.415 --> 01:03:06.519
I was just joking

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.186
You think this is funny?

01:03:09.052 --> 01:03:12.192
Want to know where I live?
Come, I'll take you

01:03:14.524 --> 01:03:18.370
Come, let me take you there and
curb your curiosity!

01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:20.372
You want the truth?

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:23.706
I live by Harischchandra Ghat.
I was born and raised there

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:26.573
We burn bodies, light pyres

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:29.510
Me, my father, my uncles,
my brother... all of us, for ages

01:03:30.307 --> 01:03:32.378
Ever see a body burn?

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:35.145
Tell me, have you?

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:39.593
I see them all day, every day.
I burn the dead, day and night

01:03:40.183 --> 01:03:44.154
In the ﬁre, the skin melts
and all that's left is the bones

01:03:44.221 --> 01:03:49.000
We smash the skull
and wash the ashes into the Ganges

01:03:49.059 --> 01:03:52.199
Can you imagine?
Want to come and see?

01:03:52.963 --> 01:03:55.409
What happened? Won't you use
your friend's pretext now?

01:04:12.616 --> 01:04:14.425
Where's my tip?

01:04:15.318 --> 01:04:15.989
Why?

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:20.657
An employment letter from the
government deserves a good tip

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:48.491
You're the new
employee right?

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:49.962
Yes

01:04:50.153 --> 01:04:51.496
Please have a seat

01:05:17.113 --> 01:05:19.992
Just 2 minutes later...

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:22.828
and you could have ﬁlled
my water bottle too

01:05:23.787 --> 01:05:25.027
I'm Sadhya

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:26.526
Hello

01:05:27.056 --> 01:05:29.536
The railway has printed a great guide

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:36.536
We had to learn without
books, the hard way!

01:05:39.970 --> 01:05:41.005
Look at this...

01:05:41.071 --> 01:05:43.347
This is Mr. Mukherjee

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.218
He used to work here
before you joined

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:48.689
He refused to learn computers

01:05:48.745 --> 01:05:50.986
May I use this?
- Yes, sure

01:05:51.982 --> 01:05:56.362
Railways relocated him to a remote
area in Rajasthan

01:05:57.387 --> 01:06:00.027
Now he issues train tickets manually

01:06:01.825 --> 01:06:04.328
You must be well trained
in computers?

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:05.772
Yes

01:06:05.829 --> 01:06:07.103
Very nice

01:06:07.263 --> 01:06:08.105
Ticket!

01:06:08.398 --> 01:06:09.172
Good morning

01:06:09.266 --> 01:06:11.041
Where to?
- Lalpur

01:06:30.186 --> 01:06:32.689
<i>Shaalu, aunt is calling you</i>

01:06:46.736 --> 01:06:47.737
You know...

01:06:47.938 --> 01:06:50.316
you're not like the other boys!

01:06:50.373 --> 01:06:52.046
Really? How?

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:54.981
There is a certain
sense of honesty in you

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:58.157
Like the honesty in
Nida Fazli's poetry

01:06:59.149 --> 01:07:01.425
Now who is this Nida Fazli?

01:07:03.486 --> 01:07:05.466
That's how honest you are!

01:07:09.993 --> 01:07:11.131
The food was delicious...

01:07:11.461 --> 01:07:12.701
but the salad was stale

01:07:12.929 --> 01:07:14.806
Even the lentils were brilliant

01:07:15.298 --> 01:07:18.609
It better be.
The owner's from our caste

01:07:47.330 --> 01:07:48.673
<i>So, you finally called, huh?</i>

01:07:48.732 --> 01:07:50.541
It was you who
overreacted that day...

01:07:50.734 --> 01:07:52.145
and now you're mad at me?

01:07:53.303 --> 01:07:54.509
<i>Sum!</i>

01:07:54.871 --> 01:07:56.942
I didn't ask for an apology

01:07:57.474 --> 01:07:59.647
I'm so stupid!
- That's true

01:07:59.709 --> 01:08:01.655
I have no manners

01:08:02.145 --> 01:08:03.624
Even that is true!

01:08:05.148 --> 01:08:06.593
\Nhere've you reached?

01:08:06.783 --> 01:08:08.763
<i>Haven't even crossed the state yet</i>

01:08:08.818 --> 01:08:10.229
<i>Near the border</i>

01:08:10.754 --> 01:08:12.028
Ok, listen...

01:08:13.123 --> 01:08:14.625
My parents...

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:16.694
they...

01:08:17.327 --> 01:08:19.273
...they'll never approve of you

01:08:20.462 --> 01:08:24.434
<i>They're stuck in the past
with their old-fashioned ideas</i>

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:27.411
But I'm with you

01:08:28.505 --> 01:08:31.111
With time, parents
do come around

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:34.254
<i>Just get yourself a good job</i>

01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:39.459
Yes, I'm doing my best

01:08:41.149 --> 01:08:44.723
Placements season is approaching.
I will do my best!

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:47.558
That's the spirit!
I'll handle the rest

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:53.505
If it comes to it,
I'll run away with you

01:08:54.697 --> 01:08:56.506
<i>0k, lake care! Bye!</i>

01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:12.154
Hey man! Let's go back!

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:13.756
Wejust came in!

01:09:13.816 --> 01:09:15.886
I have a lot to study

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:18.256
Hey, turn the boat around

01:09:20.423 --> 01:09:22.630
Sir... extra sheet, please

01:09:23.827 --> 01:09:24.965
Thank you

01:09:25.595 --> 01:09:28.269
I'm doing my ﬁnal year
in civil engineering...

01:09:28.464 --> 01:09:31.343
from Seth Kinaram Agarwal
Polytechnique College

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:35.041
My career objective is to
pursue a career in engineering...

01:09:35.270 --> 01:09:37.911
with focus on mechanical drafting

01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:42.020
Deepak: Can't wait to see you.
I'rn about to get a job!

01:09:56.326 --> 01:09:58.203
Shove the skull inside

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:02.699
I'll go get Deepak to help

01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:06.038
Hey, Deepak

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:07.546
What is it?
- Hurry up

01:10:07.637 --> 01:10:10.641
Dad's drunk again and there
are lots of bodies to burn

01:10:11.507 --> 01:10:12.679
Wake up!

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:18.653
<i>Everybody wants to avoid
work in</i> this family!

01:10:19.082 --> 01:10:20.891
<i>I'm bloody tired of this</i>
bonded <i>labour!</i>

01:10:21.484 --> 01:10:22.554
Hey, Deepak!

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:40.774
Wait up, you thief!

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:44.716
One more time and I'll
throw you in these pyres!

01:10:58.888 --> 01:11:01.368
They have not even covered
the bodies properly

01:11:01.691 --> 01:11:04.535
Shambu!
Light some pyres there

01:11:05.061 --> 01:11:06.062
I'm on it

01:11:06.162 --> 01:11:07.800
Bathe this one ﬁrst

01:11:08.064 --> 01:11:09.338
DeePak!

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:16.843
Light some pyres over there and
then some more over there

01:11:16.940 --> 01:11:18.010
There?

01:11:18.074 --> 01:11:20.350
Near the edge.
As many as you can

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:22.821
Shall I ﬁnish here ﬁrst?
- Yes

01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:35.566
More sawdust!

01:11:51.107 --> 01:11:54.384
Sikandar needs more wood.
Go help him

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:07.657
Deepak! Give us a hand

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:24.683
Be careful

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:28.348
Easy

01:12:31.848 --> 01:12:33.486
Did the cops say anything?

01:12:33.883 --> 01:12:38.389
That the pilgrims‘ bus fell
into the Ganges

01:12:38.821 --> 01:12:39.561
Really?

01:12:39.656 --> 01:12:42.500
Public aid workers dumped
all the bodies here

01:12:43.226 --> 01:12:44.864
Not a single survivor?

01:12:44.961 --> 01:12:45.996
No

01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:55.467
You know...

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:59.363
28 trains stop at this station

01:14:59.862 --> 01:15:01.307
Guess how many don't?

01:15:03.699 --> 01:15:04.939
64!

01:15:06.469 --> 01:15:08.608
Which means, it's
easy to come here...

01:15:08.971 --> 01:15:10.507
but it's difﬁcult to leave!

01:15:27.190 --> 01:15:29.830
Could you check
the status of this ticket?

01:15:30.159 --> 01:15:31.331
<i>Listen... l know i! was fun</i>

01:15:31.427 --> 01:15:32.701
But we need to get back now

01:15:32.795 --> 01:15:33.933
One more day

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:35.575
Not conﬁrmed yet

01:15:35.665 --> 01:15:38.271
Could you check the last
minute availabilities?

01:15:38.334 --> 01:15:40.371
Even one seat for both of us is ﬁne

01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:42.381
One seat? I like that...

01:15:52.982 --> 01:15:54.052
No seats available

01:15:54.517 --> 01:15:56.394
Any cancellations?
- None whatsoever!

01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:04.470
Come and see this amazing competition!

01:16:04.527 --> 01:16:06.404
Never before seen!

01:16:06.462 --> 01:16:07.440
Jhonta!

01:16:07.697 --> 01:16:09.540
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

01:16:09.632 --> 01:16:11.339
these kids will dive

01:16:11.434 --> 01:16:12.344
Jhonta!

01:16:12.435 --> 01:16:15.780
He's not here. Bet on someone else

01:16:16.472 --> 01:16:19.146
Put your money on Babua.
He's sure to win!

01:16:19.675 --> 01:16:20.676
Put it on Babua

01:16:20.776 --> 01:16:22.153
How much?
- 200 Rupees

01:16:22.245 --> 01:16:24.191
Professor bets 200 on Babua!

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:27.056
Get ready

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:28.451
1...

01:16:28.518 --> 01:16:29.553
2...

01:16:33.322 --> 01:16:35.666
Can you see anything in my mouth?
- No!

01:16:35.725 --> 01:16:38.296
Now I'll put this ball in my mouth.
Watch closely!

01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:50.851
Now... 1... 2... and...

01:16:56.078 --> 01:16:57.716
Here's your share

01:16:57.814 --> 01:17:00.988
I deserve at least 500 Rupees
- We'll adjust it next time

01:17:03.286 --> 01:17:04.890
How much did you lose?

01:17:22.171 --> 01:17:23.548
Look how late it is!

01:17:31.314 --> 01:17:32.816
Do you hear me?

01:17:33.449 --> 01:17:35.019
Turned mute, have you?

01:17:37.253 --> 01:17:38.163
Where were you?

01:17:38.254 --> 01:17:39.255
Having fun

01:17:39.321 --> 01:17:43.667
Are you hereto work or have fun?

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:46.473
I'm having fun with my own money!
Why is your ass on ﬁre?

01:17:46.529 --> 01:17:47.530
Shut up!

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:50.140
Those other orphan kids
have ruined you

01:17:50.199 --> 01:17:51.735
Show some respect!

01:17:54.637 --> 01:17:57.550
You will not go anywhere
during a competition

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:00.020
Acting like the king of Banaras!

01:18:00.376 --> 01:18:01.582
Throwing money down the drain!

01:18:01.644 --> 01:18:02.884
I'll tell Devi!

01:18:02.945 --> 01:18:05.084
Do what you want

01:18:05.948 --> 01:18:07.586
Sit your butt here!

01:18:07.984 --> 01:18:09.429
Don't you dare move

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:11.625
Sit down!

01:18:12.655 --> 01:18:13.895
Such arrogance!

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:17.170
From now on,
I want all your winnings

01:18:32.975 --> 01:18:36.286
<i>The internship discussion topic is...</i>

01:18:36.679 --> 01:18:39.558
the effects of industrialization...

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:42.622
on human life and on society at large

01:19:13.816 --> 01:19:15.489
Say something, Deepak

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:21.329
You've been quiet for
a really longtime

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:28.698
No, it's okay.
Take your time

01:19:32.835 --> 01:19:34.837
"l like poetry..."

01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:45.653
"You move like the
misty morning train...

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:50.624
I tremble like a bridge in the rain"

01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:17.319
"If it comes to that,
I'll run away with you"

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:39.302
When does this grief ever end?

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:53.125
Deepak, get up!

01:20:58.888 --> 01:21:00.367
You're being crazy!

01:21:10.332 --> 01:21:13.472
You need to control yourself

01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:21.478
Hey Deepak, take
my bike keys

01:21:23.078 --> 01:21:24.557
Shaalu!!!

01:21:48.504 --> 01:21:50.780
You promised the translation
would be done by today

01:21:51.207 --> 01:21:53.084
The printers are sitting idle

01:21:53.909 --> 01:21:55.081
Mr. Pathak?

01:21:55.845 --> 01:21:57.256
ls everything 0k?

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:01.519
I'll deliver it within 3 days

01:22:01.784 --> 01:22:03.286
3 more days?

01:22:03.352 --> 01:22:05.423
Devi's not keeping
well these days

01:22:08.457 --> 01:22:10.130
Mr. Verma...

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.140
could you give me an
advance please?

01:22:13.195 --> 01:22:16.540
You've already kept me
hanging like a bat

01:22:18.334 --> 01:22:21.213
<i>Still, I can't say no</i>

01:22:21.637 --> 01:22:23.082
Here you go

01:22:24.573 --> 01:22:25.574
It's ﬁne

01:22:26.342 --> 01:22:27.480
Good bye!

01:22:37.319 --> 01:22:39.765
Sorry for the delay!

01:22:49.164 --> 01:22:50.370
How much is this?

01:22:53.169 --> 01:22:54.842
30,000 Rupees for now...

01:23:00.509 --> 01:23:01.647
Come with me

01:23:09.185 --> 01:23:10.687
See that gate over there?

01:23:12.254 --> 01:23:12.857
Yes

01:23:12.955 --> 01:23:15.026
There's a shop opposite

01:23:15.691 --> 01:23:17.193
"Pappu scrap dealer"

01:23:17.493 --> 01:23:20.064
Sell this crappy old engine
for 10 or 15,000 Rupees

01:23:21.130 --> 01:23:23.269
The thing is we are trying...

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:26.279
I think we'll be able to complete
the payment soon

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:27.973
You think this is a joke?

01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:33.380
This is not enough

01:23:34.977 --> 01:23:36.888
Are you a child?

01:23:37.146 --> 01:23:39.752
I'll pay the rest this week

01:23:40.449 --> 01:23:41.894
Please take this

01:23:50.025 --> 01:23:51.561
You better clear it this week...

01:23:51.727 --> 01:23:53.536
and complete the balance
by next month

01:24:06.976 --> 01:24:07.920
Money?

01:24:12.247 --> 01:24:13.726
Please hurry, sir!

01:24:15.284 --> 01:24:17.195
Where to?
- Howrah

01:24:17.286 --> 01:24:18.264
As a "Devi"...

01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:20.630
you should have 4 arms on each side

01:24:21.190 --> 01:24:23.796
8 tickets in record speed!

01:24:26.328 --> 01:24:28.069
Sir, please hurry

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:30.205
What's the rush?

01:24:34.203 --> 01:24:36.012
My father says...

01:24:36.171 --> 01:24:37.741
if you haven't tasted kheer...

01:24:38.173 --> 01:24:41.382
you're missing one of life's
greatest pleasures

01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:45.086
Here, have some

01:24:45.981 --> 01:24:47.051
No, you have it

01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:48.594
That goes without saying

01:24:49.184 --> 01:24:51.221
Father's cooked it himself

01:24:51.687 --> 01:24:52.995
It's his birthday today

01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:55.167
Oh, 0k

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:03.709
Wow
- Isn't it delicious?

01:25:03.799 --> 01:25:04.800
Yes very

01:25:12.808 --> 01:25:14.253
Do you live alone?

01:25:14.443 --> 01:25:16.548
No, I live with my father

01:25:17.046 --> 01:25:18.548
Father lives alone

01:25:21.483 --> 01:25:23.360
I mean, he's alone during the day

01:25:30.492 --> 01:25:31.971
‘Kheer’?

01:25:33.662 --> 01:25:36.472
Haven't cooked it in
a while, so I thought...

01:25:38.367 --> 01:25:41.541
I just had dinner. Keep it,
I'll have it tomorrow

01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:46.546
Have it, please

01:25:48.544 --> 01:25:50.455
You're so fond of it

01:25:57.886 --> 01:25:59.194
It's good

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:01.998
ls there any milk left for
tomorrow morning?

01:26:04.526 --> 01:26:05.527
What is it?

01:26:05.928 --> 01:26:08.238
I completed a month
at work today. So...

01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:09.807
it's my salary cheque

01:26:11.133 --> 01:26:12.544
How much?

01:26:12.635 --> 01:26:13.978
20 thousand Rupees

01:26:15.537 --> 01:26:16.914
Great!

01:26:18.941 --> 01:26:20.420
Come, sit next to me

01:26:25.547 --> 01:26:28.153
You never told me your
job was conﬁrmed

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:30.619
It's temporary

01:26:31.286 --> 01:26:34.699
I'll work until we arrange
the ransom money

01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:35.866
Then...

01:26:35.958 --> 01:26:37.062
And then?

01:26:43.932 --> 01:26:47.470
I'm planning to take up a
course at Allahabad university

01:26:48.804 --> 01:26:52.149
I'll work part-time
near the university

01:26:52.341 --> 01:26:54.150
You want to move out?

01:27:02.751 --> 01:27:03.889
Yes

01:27:05.654 --> 01:27:06.826
Why?

01:27:08.490 --> 01:27:10.993
If it wasn't for this <i>case,</i>
I would have already left

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:18.507
Maybe I'm better off alone

01:27:19.334 --> 01:27:20.972
Allahabad isn't too far

01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:23.648
I'll come back here once in a while
- What about your father?

01:27:31.313 --> 01:27:33.452
I don't ﬁt in your life anywhere?

01:27:38.153 --> 01:27:40.690
If you've ﬁgured out so much then...

01:27:42.457 --> 01:27:43.527
Go

01:27:46.995 --> 01:27:49.441
I did not kill your mother!

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:57.072
I'll quietly sleep on the ghat!

01:28:00.275 --> 01:28:01.913
Father, please!

01:28:06.748 --> 01:28:08.591
Don't cry, please

01:31:12.167 --> 01:31:15.341
Narrow gauges are still used
in hilly areas

01:31:15.837 --> 01:31:20.217
Broad-gauge technology
will eventually replace it

01:31:20.675 --> 01:31:23.087
Graduated ﬁrst in your class?
- Yes

01:31:23.478 --> 01:31:25.958
You're hired for a six-month trial
in Allahabad

01:31:26.882 --> 01:31:28.828
Thank you, sir
- Congratulations

01:32:00.182 --> 01:32:02.560
<i>Now</i> we're <i>on it completely</i>

01:32:05.621 --> 01:32:08.568
Even Devi's now got a temporary job

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:14.697
I have a feeling we'll
pay the dues soon

01:32:17.733 --> 01:32:20.509
6th of the next month
is your last day to pay up

01:32:22.471 --> 01:32:24.542
Or else the video's going up
on YouTube

01:32:26.274 --> 01:32:28.083
I'm sure you know
what YouTube is?

01:32:37.085 --> 01:32:38.587
Dad, shall we leave?

01:32:44.226 --> 01:32:45.603
Yes, let's go

01:32:50.532 --> 01:32:53.172
<i>Today on the eve of Maha Shivrazri</i>

01:32:53.235 --> 01:32:55.579
We <i>will</i> have the
biggest competition till date

01:32:55.670 --> 01:32:56.978
<i>So on this note</i>

01:32:57.038 --> 01:32:59.245
All hail in the name of...
Lord Mahadev!

01:32:59.341 --> 01:33:01.287
All okay?

01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:04.356
Take down my bet
- How much?

01:33:05.046 --> 01:33:06.286
10,000 Rupees

01:33:06.348 --> 01:33:09.056
You'll win right?
- Obviously!

01:33:14.055 --> 01:33:16.160
Did you know Devi...

01:33:18.193 --> 01:33:21.174
there's always one
friend in every group...

01:33:21.496 --> 01:33:23.476
who is considered
the most wise

01:33:23.865 --> 01:33:24.468
Yes

01:33:24.533 --> 01:33:27.946
Back in college... I used
to be that intellectual

01:33:30.972 --> 01:33:34.681
All my friends used to seek
my help with their problems

01:33:35.143 --> 01:33:37.145
My advice to everyone...

01:33:37.679 --> 01:33:41.058
whatever is in your heart,
say it out loud!

01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:43.356
Hiding will get you nothing

01:33:53.061 --> 01:33:55.871
<i>Let's see who is going to win today!</i>

01:33:56.364 --> 01:33:58.002
Jhonta, dive there!

01:34:01.436 --> 01:34:03.109
Hurry up! Faster!

01:34:04.506 --> 01:34:05.541
On the extreme end

01:34:07.309 --> 01:34:09.846
Now that you're leaving...

01:34:10.278 --> 01:34:14.351
I think it's time I should
listen to the "intellectual" inside me...

01:34:15.317 --> 01:34:19.697
and tell you what is in my heart

01:34:25.861 --> 01:34:26.805
Jhonta!

01:34:32.067 --> 01:34:33.068
Jhonta!

01:34:34.736 --> 01:34:36.647
Dive, Munna!

01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:43.216
Everything okay?

01:34:45.947 --> 01:34:47.051
<i>Sum!</i>

01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:49.552
I have to leave

01:34:59.594 --> 01:35:01.699
Give way, move!

01:35:01.797 --> 01:35:03.834
Everybody move from here!

01:35:03.932 --> 01:35:04.910
Give way!

01:35:06.701 --> 01:35:07.975
Jhonta!!!

01:35:08.036 --> 01:35:10.915
I won't ever let you play
this game, my child!

01:35:31.059 --> 01:35:31.969
What?

01:35:32.027 --> 01:35:34.303
I lost all your money, isn't it?

01:35:36.364 --> 01:35:37.172
No

01:36:01.957 --> 01:36:03.095
What happened?

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:05.434
Want to see a magic trick?

01:36:07.529 --> 01:36:09.406
Do you see anything
in my hand?

01:36:11.633 --> 01:36:14.273
Anything in this one?

01:36:14.502 --> 01:36:15.480
No

01:36:15.670 --> 01:36:17.547
Anything in my mouth?

01:36:22.177 --> 01:36:24.179
1...2...3...

01:36:32.153 --> 01:36:33.188
Whose is it?

01:36:33.454 --> 01:36:34.797
It's for you

01:36:35.957 --> 01:36:36.867
Where did you ﬁnd it?

01:36:36.958 --> 01:36:39.734
Found it in the river
while diving

01:36:58.079 --> 01:36:59.490
Yes, great!

01:37:04.586 --> 01:37:05.587
Thank you

01:37:44.993 --> 01:37:46.063
It's hot!

01:37:47.062 --> 01:37:49.303
I've packed lunch.
Have it on the train

01:37:49.464 --> 01:37:50.943
You eat, I'll pack

01:38:00.875 --> 01:38:02.286
It's lovely

01:38:13.021 --> 01:38:14.227
Shall we go?

01:38:25.533 --> 01:38:26.671
Blessings

01:38:26.768 --> 01:38:28.304
Call me once you reach

01:38:29.604 --> 01:38:31.413
I'm off
- Hurry up

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.148
Step back

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:42.526
Go sit
- See you soon, Dad

01:39:43.945 --> 01:39:45.185
Hello!

01:39:46.047 --> 01:39:48.857
I'm hereto see Mr. Ramdhari Agarwal

01:39:49.250 --> 01:39:51.059
I am Devi Pathak

01:39:51.919 --> 01:39:55.423
Piyush was my friend. That day...

01:39:55.490 --> 01:39:58.266
Hold on. It's better we talk inside!

01:40:25.153 --> 01:40:28.464
What are you doing? Are you crazy?
- Why have you come here?

01:40:28.523 --> 01:40:30.002
Are you okay?

01:40:31.059 --> 01:40:32.163
Why?

01:40:32.727 --> 01:40:34.764
What harm did he ever do to you?

01:42:27.141 --> 01:42:28.449
Water?

01:43:11.352 --> 01:43:14.265
30 rupees to go to Sangam!

01:43:15.456 --> 01:43:16.958
Come on, miss!

01:43:17.458 --> 01:43:18.869
And you, sir?

01:43:19.126 --> 01:43:20.662
I'll take you to Sangam

01:44:15.149 --> 01:44:17.026
ls this your ﬁrst visit to Sangam?

01:44:17.452 --> 01:44:18.453
Yes

01:44:19.921 --> 01:44:20.991
And you?

01:44:21.823 --> 01:44:23.131
Second time

01:44:26.961 --> 01:44:29.134
Someone once said you must visit
Sangam twice in a lifetime

01:44:29.664 --> 01:44:30.642
Why?

01:44:30.698 --> 01:44:33.008
Alone the ﬁrst time, and with
someone the second time around
