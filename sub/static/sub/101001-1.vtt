00:44.545 --> 00:46.046
Authorities worldwide

00:46.129 --> 00:47.673
expressed shock
at these allegations.

00:47.756 --> 00:49.967
Most daring
thefts of modern times.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.528
Fowl is said
to be hiding ancient relics

00:51.552 --> 00:52.654
worth hundreds of millions of...

00:52.678 --> 00:53.720
Time and again,

00:53.804 --> 00:56.390
these museums
were robbed of untold riches.

00:56.473 --> 00:57.575
Some say the true amount stolen

00:57.599 --> 00:58.642
may never be known.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.644
Where I am amidst
what can only be described

01:00.727 --> 01:02.229
as a media frenzy.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.249
He couldn't dismiss the fact
that when he was arrested...

01:04.273 --> 01:05.315
The collection contains

01:05.399 --> 01:06.459
the rarest evidence
of ancient worlds.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.528
Most expressed horror at his
alleged criminal activity,

01:09.695 --> 01:12.614
while others hinted at a more
widespread conspiracy.

01:12.781 --> 01:13.824
Many similarities

01:13.907 --> 01:16.702
to numerous daring thefts
shrouded in mystery.

01:16.785 --> 01:18.078
A crowd has gathered...

01:18.161 --> 01:19.162
It's him! It's him!

01:19.246 --> 01:20.706
Breaking news.
There is the car.

01:20.873 --> 01:22.249
Yes, the car has come down.

01:22.332 --> 01:24.018
And it looks like
young Artemis Fowl is here.

01:24.042 --> 01:27.421
Authorities
have now made connections

01:27.504 --> 01:28.505
to one man.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.340
Artemis Fowl.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.633
Breaking news now

01:31.800 --> 01:33.760
and a suspected accomplice
of Artemis Fowl

01:33.844 --> 01:35.220
is today arrested
near Fowl Manor.

01:35.304 --> 01:36.305
Help me.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.807
Is this
unidentified individual a link

01:38.891 --> 01:41.560
to Artemis Fowl
and the multiple thefts?

01:43.687 --> 01:44.813
We have reports

01:44.897 --> 01:46.332
that British intelligence
authorities

01:46.356 --> 01:48.692
are expected to question
the subject immediately.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.027
Is it true?

01:50.194 --> 01:51.634
Do you have anything to say,
Artemis?

01:51.695 --> 01:52.946
How does it feel

01:53.030 --> 01:54.630
to have a criminal
for a father, Artemis?

02:13.800 --> 02:14.968
Your name?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.471
Mulch Diggums.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.182
Exactly what were you doing
near Fowl Manor?

02:20.265 --> 02:21.266
So now it's illegal

02:21.391 --> 02:22.392
to go for a hike?

02:22.559 --> 02:23.685
This was no hike.

02:24.186 --> 02:26.647
Unless you tell us exactly
what happened at Fowl Manor,

02:26.813 --> 02:28.690
you will be
permanently imprisoned.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.400
Wait, wait, wait.

02:30.567 --> 02:31.985
You don't want me.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.905
No. No, I'm just
a talented tunneler.

02:35.364 --> 02:37.658
You want the brains
of the operation.

02:38.242 --> 02:40.619
The one who stole the Aculos.

02:40.786 --> 02:43.038
What, precisely, is the Aculos?

02:43.622 --> 02:45.082
The Aculos.

02:45.249 --> 02:48.210
A weapon
so powerful and mysterious,

02:48.293 --> 02:49.711
it can barely be imagined.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.046
You're lying.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.607
Look, I know
you don't believe my story,

02:52.631 --> 02:53.632
but I can prove it.

02:53.715 --> 02:56.093
Mr. Diggums,
I highly doubt that.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.554
You will see.

02:58.637 --> 02:59.721
All I see is

02:59.847 --> 03:01.825
that there was some highly
unusual seismic activity

03:01.849 --> 03:03.350
around Fowl Manor

03:03.517 --> 03:06.019
and reports from a crazed
fisherman of fairies.

03:06.186 --> 03:10.107
Well, maybe the fisherman saw
something he wasn't meant to.

03:10.274 --> 03:11.275
It's fantasy.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.277
What's reality is that
you are a common thief

03:13.443 --> 03:16.029
who is somehow in league
with a quite uncommon thief.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.907
We want to know everything
about the man you work for.

03:19.074 --> 03:20.242
The man?

03:20.409 --> 03:22.244
No.

03:22.661 --> 03:24.621
This isn't about the father.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.207
This is about the son.

03:27.708 --> 03:28.959
The son?

03:29.126 --> 03:32.045
Do not underestimate the kid.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.799
Let me show you

03:35.966 --> 03:40.345
the infinite possibilities
of magic.

03:41.305 --> 03:43.515
Let me tell you

03:43.682 --> 03:47.186
the story of Artemis Fowl.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.945
A story that begins where
every great story begins,

03:57.112 --> 04:00.949
in a place where magic
and wonder still exist.

04:01.116 --> 04:03.452
The most magical place on Earth.

04:04.036 --> 04:05.245
Ireland.

04:05.412 --> 04:08.207
Home of Artemis Fowl.

04:51.834 --> 04:53.961
Artemis loved Ireland.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.718
The sea and the land.

05:01.885 --> 05:04.137
Not so much the school.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.894
You see, he just didn't need it.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.062
When he was seven,

05:12.229 --> 05:14.481
he beat European
chess champion Evan Rashoggi

05:14.565 --> 05:16.066
in five moves.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.569
When he was nine, he won
the architectural competition

05:18.735 --> 05:20.529
to design
the Dublin Opera House.

05:20.696 --> 05:22.030
When he was ten,

05:22.114 --> 05:24.157
he cloned a goat
and named it Bruce.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.909
Weird choice,
but he's an unusual kid.

05:25.993 --> 05:26.994
Good.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.164
And you know
when you're that unusual,

05:31.331 --> 05:33.000
you're going to stick out.

05:37.546 --> 05:40.424
Well, Artemis,
let's talk, shall we?

05:40.591 --> 05:41.592
Certainly, sir.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.597
I can see
you're admiring my chair.

05:47.723 --> 05:49.224
It's a family heirloom.

05:49.391 --> 05:52.352
Grandfather acquired it
from Sotheby's.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.354
William and Mary period,

05:54.438 --> 05:57.774
1689 to 1702,
as I'm sure you know.

05:58.317 --> 05:59.401
Impressive.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.487
Once in use at the palace,
Buckingham Palace.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.406
Queen's favorite chair,
apparently.

06:04.990 --> 06:07.492
Now, Artemis,
there is a problem.

06:07.659 --> 06:09.828
The problem is that
I know the textbook reply

06:09.912 --> 06:11.788
to any question
you may choose to ask.

06:11.955 --> 06:14.416
The problem is that you don't
respect anyone enough

06:14.499 --> 06:16.126
to treat them as an equal.

06:16.293 --> 06:17.853
That's ridiculous.
I hold several people

06:17.878 --> 06:18.962
in the very highest esteem.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.632
Really? Who, for example?

06:21.798 --> 06:23.008
Albert Einstein.

06:23.175 --> 06:24.968
His theories
were usually correct.

06:26.595 --> 06:28.972
How about someone
you actually know?

06:31.517 --> 06:33.393
You seem to have
all the answers, Doctor.

06:33.477 --> 06:34.561
Why don't you tell me?

06:34.728 --> 06:35.938
Well,

06:36.104 --> 06:37.648
where shall we start?

06:37.814 --> 06:40.526
That's my biography, I presume?

06:40.692 --> 06:43.445
It is.
It explains quite a lot.

06:43.654 --> 06:44.947
Such as?

06:45.113 --> 06:46.615
Well, firstly,

06:46.698 --> 06:49.117
there's your dear mother,
of course.

06:49.868 --> 06:52.996
Who was a wonderful woman,
in my opinion,

06:53.163 --> 06:56.041
and taken from us far too soon,

06:56.917 --> 07:00.796
but who sadly had absolutely
no control over your behavior.

07:02.548 --> 07:05.592
Then, of course,
there's your father

07:05.759 --> 07:09.096
and his mysterious absences
from home.

07:10.305 --> 07:12.432
This is a sensitive area,
Doctor.

07:13.600 --> 07:16.395
But do you think
that's why you are as you are?

07:17.396 --> 07:18.397
No.

07:18.564 --> 07:19.666
And by the way, I didn't know

07:19.690 --> 07:21.358
they allowed fakes
at the palace.

07:21.525 --> 07:22.693
- Fake?
- It's clever,

07:22.776 --> 07:23.777
I'll give you that.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.362
But look at these
furniture tacks.

07:25.529 --> 07:27.030
Crisscross pattern on the head.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.115
Machine-tooled.

07:28.282 --> 07:31.285
Makes it 1890s at the earliest.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.786
Your grandfather was duped.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.705
Artemis,
you're lashing out at me,

07:34.788 --> 07:36.790
but I think I know
what this is really about.

07:37.249 --> 07:40.711
Is it because of the burden
of your father's name?

07:41.837 --> 07:42.838
No.

07:43.338 --> 07:45.048
It's because
I'm forced to endure

07:45.132 --> 07:46.717
this ridiculous therapy.

07:47.176 --> 07:48.218
Artemis?

07:48.677 --> 07:50.846
Look! Just who do you think
you are?

07:54.266 --> 07:57.269
But, of course,
Artemis wasn't on his own,

07:57.436 --> 08:00.814
even if it may have seemed
that way sometimes.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.367
For if there was one thing
Artemis liked

08:12.451 --> 08:14.369
more than his own company,

08:14.536 --> 08:18.373
it was being at home
with his dad.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.503
Artemis Fowl, Sr.,

08:22.669 --> 08:25.672
a dealer
of antiques and rarities

08:25.839 --> 08:28.175
and just about
every Irish fairy tale

08:28.258 --> 08:30.177
you might care to imagine.

08:38.560 --> 08:39.621
They're trained in the art of...

08:39.645 --> 08:42.564
Except that
you didn't have to imagine,

08:42.731 --> 08:45.192
for Artemis Sr.
Taught Artemis Jr.

08:45.275 --> 08:46.395
Everything there was to know

08:46.485 --> 08:48.779
about the leprechauns
and the banshees

08:48.946 --> 08:52.407
and the sprites and the goblins.

08:52.574 --> 08:54.618
So much so that you might
even have thought

08:54.785 --> 08:56.411
that Artemis Sr. believed

08:56.495 --> 08:59.289
in the legends
of the little people.

08:59.456 --> 09:01.583
He certainly shared
his passion with his son

09:01.667 --> 09:02.709
on the rare occasions

09:02.876 --> 09:04.962
when he wasn't away from home.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.505
But while he was there,

09:06.672 --> 09:09.508
he was absolutely determined
to have Artemis know

09:09.675 --> 09:12.344
all that could be known
about the fairies.

09:13.011 --> 09:16.849
To prepare the boy for a day
that would come much sooner

09:17.015 --> 09:18.350
than anyone expected.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.121
Did I ever tell you
how all those fairy stones

09:22.145 --> 09:23.185
got to come to Fowl Manor?

09:24.815 --> 09:25.816
Thousands of years ago,

09:25.899 --> 09:27.484
this is where
the peace was made.

09:27.651 --> 09:29.611
After the war
between the human world

09:29.695 --> 09:30.863
and the Tuatha De Danaan,

09:31.029 --> 09:32.739
a human and a fairy met...

09:32.906 --> 09:35.033
Just tell me
when you're leaving.

09:39.496 --> 09:40.497
The helicopter's

09:40.622 --> 09:41.683
being prepared
for me right now, son.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.142
I'm sorry.
I'll be back as soon as I can.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.519
That's what you said
the last time,

09:44.543 --> 09:45.794
and the time before.

09:45.961 --> 09:48.172
I know, Arty.

09:48.338 --> 09:51.466
There's just one very
important thing I have to do.

09:51.633 --> 09:52.843
And I know it's been hard,

09:52.926 --> 09:55.304
but, look,
my work is coming to an end.

09:55.470 --> 09:56.847
And like the stories, you know,

09:56.930 --> 09:58.682
they all have an ending
that just...

10:00.184 --> 10:02.019
Well, it makes you smile.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.480
And this one
will be no different.

10:05.647 --> 10:08.400
And when it ends,
a new story will begin.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.277
And maybe,

10:10.444 --> 10:11.820
just maybe,

10:12.446 --> 10:13.655
it'll be yours.

10:13.822 --> 10:14.990
I'm not a kid anymore, Dad.

10:16.909 --> 10:18.744
Well, you used to
believe in magic.

10:18.911 --> 10:20.078
You believed in the goblins,

10:20.162 --> 10:21.496
and you believed in the trolls.

10:21.622 --> 10:22.849
You believed in everything
I told you

10:22.873 --> 10:24.124
about the Hill of Tara.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.210
All I really want

10:27.044 --> 10:28.629
is to believe in you.

10:33.717 --> 10:34.801
Okay.

10:38.931 --> 10:39.932
Come here, son.

10:46.021 --> 10:47.356
I love you, son.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.983
More than you could ever know.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.279
Then take me with you.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.534
You're all I have now, Arty.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.620
Let me keep you safe
for a little longer.

11:07.543 --> 11:08.794
Come on.

11:42.911 --> 11:46.331
And remember,
until I see you again,

11:46.415 --> 11:48.375
may the road rise up
to meet you.

11:49.126 --> 11:51.378
May the wind
be always at your back.

11:51.879 --> 11:54.882
May the sun shine
warm upon your face.

11:55.048 --> 11:58.135
May the rain fall soft
upon your fields.

11:58.302 --> 12:00.262
And until we meet again,

12:01.430 --> 12:03.473
may a friend be always near.

12:04.600 --> 12:05.934
Good night, son.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.436
Good night, Dad.

12:27.581 --> 12:28.916
What are you talking about?

12:31.084 --> 12:33.295
Yes, he took off yesterday,
as planned.

12:38.133 --> 12:39.551
What do you mean,
he never arrived?

12:39.718 --> 12:41.053
The boat was empty.

12:41.512 --> 12:43.096
Have you checked the manifest?

12:45.599 --> 12:47.434
How long
before the media have it?

12:47.809 --> 12:50.229
I don't know. You'd better
make some inquiries.

12:54.525 --> 12:55.817
Domovoi Butler.

12:55.984 --> 12:57.819
Friend, mentor, bodyguard.

12:57.986 --> 13:00.072
Ten years of martial arts
training in Kyoto,

13:00.239 --> 13:01.907
seven years of
weapons training in Moscow,

13:02.074 --> 13:03.259
six years of strength training

13:03.283 --> 13:05.160
at Gold's Gym in Venice,
California.

13:05.327 --> 13:06.870
And under no circumstances

13:06.954 --> 13:08.789
were you to ever call him
"The Butler"

13:08.956 --> 13:11.458
even though his last name
was in fact "Butler."

13:11.625 --> 13:14.086
You could call him "Dom,"
or "Domovoi,"

13:14.253 --> 13:16.171
or "Very large man in a suit,"

13:16.338 --> 13:19.800
but call him "The Butler,"
and he'd snap you in half.

13:20.384 --> 13:21.802
Not always sunny, though.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.262
There will be some cloud

13:23.345 --> 13:25.389
that'll bring a few drizzles
now and again,

13:25.556 --> 13:28.058
especially along the western
and northern coast.

13:28.225 --> 13:29.852
Now back to our main story.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.272
Authorities today launched

13:33.355 --> 13:36.275
a worldwide manhunt
for Artemis Fowl.

13:36.441 --> 13:37.609
A reclusive businessman,

13:37.693 --> 13:39.736
but now
a controversial public figure

13:39.903 --> 13:41.530
whose superyacht, the Owl Star,

13:41.613 --> 13:43.323
was found abandoned last night

13:43.490 --> 13:44.992
in the South China seas.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.495
Fowl is a known collector
and antiquities dealer,

13:48.662 --> 13:50.080
but in dramatic new revelations,

13:50.247 --> 13:52.416
he is also suspected
to have been behind

13:52.583 --> 13:55.586
some of the biggest robberies
of the past 10 years,

13:55.752 --> 13:58.714
including the disappearance
of the priceless Rosetta Stone

13:58.881 --> 14:00.299
from the British Museum,

14:00.465 --> 14:03.719
the irreplaceable 14th century
Boru's harp,

14:03.886 --> 14:06.763
and the iconic Book of Kells
from Trinity College, Dublin.

14:06.930 --> 14:09.892
No sign of struggle was found
aboard the Owl Star

14:10.058 --> 14:12.477
and her owner's fate
is entirely unknown.

14:12.644 --> 14:14.688
Investigations are ongoing,

14:14.855 --> 14:16.607
but until further news
of his whereabouts

14:16.690 --> 14:18.567
can be established,
doubts will remain.

14:18.734 --> 14:20.194
My dad.

14:22.696 --> 14:24.573
- Artemis.
- Where is he, Dom?

14:24.740 --> 14:26.283
We don't know.
I have people on the way

14:26.366 --> 14:27.367
to the wreck as we speak.

14:27.451 --> 14:29.703
And the remaining question...

14:29.870 --> 14:31.455
Artemis Fowl,

14:31.622 --> 14:35.292
antiquities dealer
or criminal mastermind?

14:35.459 --> 14:36.835
How dare they!

14:37.002 --> 14:39.254
He's not a criminal!
He's my dad!

14:39.421 --> 14:41.131
He's my dad!

14:43.800 --> 14:45.010
Dad!

14:49.681 --> 14:51.517
Artemis, don't answer the phone!

14:52.726 --> 14:54.603
- Artemis!
- Dad!

14:58.315 --> 15:00.108
Hello? Dad?

15:01.401 --> 15:02.528
Hello?

15:04.154 --> 15:06.615
Artemis Jr., I presume.

15:06.782 --> 15:08.617
I have your father.

15:09.284 --> 15:10.953
What? Who is this?

15:11.119 --> 15:12.120
Is this a hoax?

15:12.287 --> 15:13.914
If you have my father,
I want proof.

15:14.248 --> 15:16.124
Then you shall have some.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.751
Dad? Dad?

15:17.835 --> 15:18.836
Artemis.

15:19.837 --> 15:20.879
Artemis.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.798
You listen to me, son,
you stay out of this.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.007
Okay? Do you hear me?

15:24.091 --> 15:25.235
There's no way you can help me.

15:25.259 --> 15:26.260
It's too big.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.306
Everything I've told you
is true. It's all true!

15:28.428 --> 15:30.681
Your father stole something
from me and hid it.

15:30.848 --> 15:33.809
My enemies have prevented me
from retrieving it myself.

15:33.976 --> 15:35.143
You will do so on my behalf.

15:35.727 --> 15:38.063
Find the Aculos, or you will
never see him again.

15:38.814 --> 15:39.857
Artemis!

15:40.023 --> 15:41.316
What's the Aculos?

15:41.483 --> 15:42.943
You're a clever boy.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.486
You'll work it out.

15:44.653 --> 15:46.780
You have three days.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.323
Artemis, what did they say?

15:48.490 --> 15:49.491
Word for word.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.077
Whoever it was...

15:52.244 --> 15:53.537
- Man? Woman?
- I couldn't tell.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.348
But they were asking for
something called the Aculos.

15:55.372 --> 15:56.373
What is it?

15:58.542 --> 16:01.253
Artemis, get dressed
and come with me.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.094
You weren't supposed
to see this yet.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.532
Your father would kill me
if he knew we were here.

16:30.699 --> 16:33.285
I'm showing you
because I have no choice.

16:33.452 --> 16:34.745
What is all this?

16:34.870 --> 16:35.871
This is where your father

16:35.954 --> 16:37.664
kept his entire life's work.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.584
And his father,
and his father before him.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.879
It's not what it looks like,
Artemis.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.446
Everything in this room
was acquired

16:45.506 --> 16:46.924
for a specific reason.

16:47.549 --> 16:49.593
Sometimes to protect
its secrets,

16:49.760 --> 16:52.596
sometimes to keep it from
falling into the wrong hands.

16:52.763 --> 16:55.098
These are relics
from another world.

16:55.599 --> 16:57.017
I don't understand.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.352
I was never meant to share

16:58.435 --> 16:59.835
the details
of your family business.

17:00.187 --> 17:01.772
These relics
have been passed down

17:01.855 --> 17:03.106
through the generations.

17:03.273 --> 17:04.459
They're secrets that your father

17:04.483 --> 17:05.943
had intended to share with you

17:06.109 --> 17:07.402
when the time was right.

17:07.569 --> 17:08.904
But the fairies are a myth.

17:09.071 --> 17:10.271
None of this is actually true.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.282
Look around you, Arty.

17:12.950 --> 17:15.994
Maybe those stories
can help us find him.

17:18.163 --> 17:19.831
But where to begin?

17:19.998 --> 17:22.417
I don't see anything
about an Aculos, do you?

17:22.584 --> 17:23.585
No.

17:23.669 --> 17:25.337
I helped him catalogue
much of this,

17:25.420 --> 17:26.820
but he never mentioned
such a thing.

17:26.964 --> 17:29.341
And he always shared
his discoveries with me.

17:29.508 --> 17:31.718
The only thing he kept private
was his journal.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.387
Then that's what
we have to find.

17:33.804 --> 17:35.556
I wouldn't know
where to begin to look.

17:35.931 --> 17:37.891
Could your father
have ever given you a clue

17:37.975 --> 17:39.643
as to where to start?

17:40.102 --> 17:41.979
He never told me how to start,

17:42.855 --> 17:44.648
but he may have told me
how to end.

17:46.567 --> 17:48.569
- End?
- Yeah.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.779
He read the same poem to me
every night before bed

17:50.946 --> 17:52.739
and every time he left.

17:53.866 --> 17:55.909
"May the road rise up
to meet you.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.953
"May the wind
be always at your back.

17:58.120 --> 18:01.039
"May the sun shine
warm upon your face."

18:04.209 --> 18:06.962
"May the rains fall soft
upon your fields."

18:09.339 --> 18:10.924
Who wrote this poem, Arty?

18:11.967 --> 18:12.968
Nobody knows.

18:13.760 --> 18:14.970
That's just it.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.054
Then how do you find it?

18:17.347 --> 18:19.308
It's known
as "The Irish Blessing."

18:22.895 --> 18:23.937
It's a journal.

18:24.021 --> 18:25.731
It's Dad's journal.

18:25.898 --> 18:27.441
Go to the last entry.

18:33.655 --> 18:36.658
"She's hunting me now
and would kill me to find it.

18:36.867 --> 18:37.868
"She knows the truth of

18:37.951 --> 18:39.471
"what Beechwood gave me
before he died.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.622
"They know
we have the Aculos."

18:41.788 --> 18:44.082
The voice on the phone
told you to find it.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.919
"The Aculos cannot fall
into the wrong hands.

18:47.085 --> 18:48.420
"It had to be protected,

18:48.504 --> 18:50.631
"even from
the fairies themselves.

18:51.548 --> 18:52.925
"Time to believe."

18:53.217 --> 18:55.052
Time to believe in fairies?

18:55.677 --> 18:57.221
But they're not real.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.265
Are they?

19:03.060 --> 19:05.521
But as Artemis
would soon find out,

19:05.604 --> 19:07.022
they are very real

19:07.189 --> 19:08.982
and they've been living
right under your feet

19:09.066 --> 19:10.943
for 1,000 years.

19:12.861 --> 19:15.239
And their cities
at the center of the Earth

19:15.322 --> 19:17.658
are not something
out of a storybook.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.577
No.

19:21.411 --> 19:23.830
They are just as real as you.

19:24.498 --> 19:28.043
Diverse and strange
and beautiful.

19:28.210 --> 19:29.670
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:29.795 --> 19:32.548
welcome to the wondrous,
thriving metropolis

19:32.631 --> 19:34.925
that is Haven City,

19:36.260 --> 19:38.846
home of the fairies.

19:50.148 --> 19:51.149
You have now arrived

19:51.233 --> 19:52.401
at Haven City Central,

19:52.568 --> 19:54.319
this transporter's terminus.

19:54.486 --> 19:56.697
Please make sure you take
all your belongings with you

19:56.780 --> 19:58.282
before leaving the transporter.

19:58.448 --> 19:59.575
Officer Holly Short,

19:59.658 --> 20:01.243
two minutes
to security briefing.

20:03.537 --> 20:05.080
Do it with Koboi.

20:05.247 --> 20:06.623
Shuttles to the surface...

20:06.790 --> 20:08.208
We bring you
a community leader...

20:08.375 --> 20:10.252
Our main story this morning.

20:10.419 --> 20:11.795
As a second week passes,

20:11.879 --> 20:14.089
there is still no sign
of the Aculos.

20:14.256 --> 20:16.008
Fears are rising.

20:16.175 --> 20:17.926
However, authorities assure us

20:18.010 --> 20:19.928
the crisis
will be swiftly handled.

20:20.095 --> 20:22.139
Even so, doubts are mounting.

20:40.032 --> 20:41.200
Yeah. Thank you.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.924
See, this is my favorite part.

20:57.382 --> 20:59.343
Mainly because I'm in it.

21:01.094 --> 21:02.804
Keep an eye out, brothers.

21:02.971 --> 21:04.681
We dwarves gotta watch
each other's backs,

21:04.765 --> 21:05.766
am I right?

21:05.933 --> 21:07.684
Lay low,
I'll get us out of here.

21:07.851 --> 21:08.852
You're not a dwarf.

21:08.977 --> 21:11.146
- No, I am, I'm a dwarf.
- No, you're not.

21:11.522 --> 21:12.940
I am a giant dwarf.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.776
You've got a big mouth
for a dwarf.

21:16.652 --> 21:19.655
You won't talk so much
at Howler's Peak.

21:19.821 --> 21:22.282
That's where we goblins
do the talking.

21:23.116 --> 21:25.786
And what we say goes.

21:27.079 --> 21:28.080
Next!

21:29.915 --> 21:30.999
Hi there, gents.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.252
Mulch Diggums.

21:33.836 --> 21:35.462
Two G's in Diggums.

21:36.171 --> 21:37.548
Tunneling and entering.

21:37.714 --> 21:39.716
Repeat offender. 400 years.

21:39.883 --> 21:41.385
Yeah, that sounds about right.

21:42.219 --> 21:44.221
Hey, hey, hey.
Knock it off. Knock it off.

21:45.389 --> 21:46.974
Knock it off!

21:50.519 --> 21:51.854
Next! Move!

21:52.020 --> 21:53.063
Officer Short.

21:53.438 --> 21:54.606
Good to see you.

21:55.065 --> 21:56.525
What are you in
for this time, Mulch?

21:56.692 --> 21:57.901
Tunneling and entering.

21:57.985 --> 21:59.087
Put in a good word for me,
will you?

21:59.111 --> 22:00.153
You know I'm an artist.

22:00.237 --> 22:01.530
Yeah. A con artist.

22:01.697 --> 22:03.740
Art is art. Great artists
are never understood.

22:03.907 --> 22:06.660
Hey, you and I would make
a great team, you know?

22:06.827 --> 22:09.079
Me cracking safes,
tunneling into banks,

22:09.246 --> 22:10.372
you watching my back

22:10.455 --> 22:12.135
with your tiny
but effective fairy weapons.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.292
That's your plan?

22:13.458 --> 22:14.727
Less of a plan,
more of a lifestyle choice.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.128
By the way, this your wallet?

22:16.587 --> 22:18.255
Stop picking my pockets!

22:18.422 --> 22:20.174
Think of my children, Holly.

22:20.340 --> 22:21.780
- You don't have children.
- Not yet.

22:22.301 --> 22:23.510
Prisoner for processing.

22:23.677 --> 22:25.929
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, don't go yet.

22:26.096 --> 22:27.306
We're the same, you know?

22:27.472 --> 22:30.726
Your last name is Short.
My whole body is short.

22:30.893 --> 22:32.102
You're not short.

22:32.269 --> 22:33.687
I keep telling you that.

22:34.438 --> 22:36.106
That's just discriminatory.

22:36.273 --> 22:39.610
I'll write it off as ignorance
because I love you!

22:39.776 --> 22:41.028
And thanks for the music.

22:41.195 --> 22:42.571
Move it now.

22:42.738 --> 22:44.239
I am very much a dwarf.

22:45.574 --> 22:46.909
Over here!

23:05.928 --> 23:07.930
Briar Cudgeon.

23:08.430 --> 23:09.973
Is this about my appeal?

23:10.140 --> 23:12.809
Yes, you will be
a commander again.

23:12.976 --> 23:15.020
All charges dropped.

23:15.187 --> 23:16.522
I've convinced the executors

23:16.605 --> 23:19.441
to grant a pardon
after your court-martial.

23:20.108 --> 23:23.445
Commander Root
was powerless to stop it.

23:24.238 --> 23:25.489
Who are you?

23:25.656 --> 23:27.741
My fairy godmother?

23:28.242 --> 23:32.329
Yes, only now you work for me.

23:32.496 --> 23:33.914
The Fowl boy is in play,

23:33.997 --> 23:35.397
and I want nothing
that prevents him

23:35.541 --> 23:37.209
from bringing me the Aculos.

23:37.376 --> 23:40.921
You will infiltrate
Fairy Command on my behalf.

23:41.088 --> 23:42.506
I spy?

23:42.673 --> 23:44.508
You spy or you die.

23:59.565 --> 24:01.275
Morning, Shorty.

24:06.321 --> 24:08.156
LEPRECON!

24:12.327 --> 24:14.222
Commander! What are all
these rumors about the Aculos?

24:14.246 --> 24:15.789
Knock it off!

24:17.082 --> 24:18.375
You've seen the news.

24:18.834 --> 24:21.170
The Aculos is still missing.

24:21.336 --> 24:24.464
Kelp, Verbil, B Squad, C Squad,

24:24.548 --> 24:27.050
you're all
on triple night duty downtown.

24:28.427 --> 24:31.513
The delicate balance of peace
in our world

24:31.597 --> 24:33.557
now hangs by a narrow thread.

24:34.224 --> 24:37.060
Until the Aculos
is safely returned,

24:37.227 --> 24:40.647
our entire civilization
is at risk

24:40.814 --> 24:42.065
from the humans

24:42.149 --> 24:45.319
or from enemies
amongst our own kind.

24:45.485 --> 24:48.989
There is a dark force at work,
and it will stop at nothing

24:49.156 --> 24:51.200
until it has the Aculos.

24:52.242 --> 24:54.203
So keep your eyes peeled.

24:55.245 --> 24:57.247
See it and report it.

24:58.207 --> 25:03.587
We must recover the Aculos
and protect our anonymity.

25:03.754 --> 25:08.217
For the peace to remain,
so must our secret existence.

25:08.383 --> 25:10.636
Preserve that at all costs.

25:10.802 --> 25:11.970
Jeopardize it,

25:12.054 --> 25:15.516
and I'll have you incarcerated
at Howler's Peak.

25:17.059 --> 25:18.227
Any questions?

25:18.393 --> 25:20.270
No? Good.

25:20.437 --> 25:21.813
Get to work.

25:23.065 --> 25:24.274
Commander Root!

25:25.400 --> 25:26.568
Yes, what is it?

25:27.361 --> 25:29.696
Commander, I have
a new lead on my father.

25:29.780 --> 25:30.989
He was at the Hill of Tara.

25:31.156 --> 25:32.950
- You're not going.
- But, Commander...

25:33.116 --> 25:34.159
That's an order.

25:34.243 --> 25:35.285
Not a request.

25:35.452 --> 25:36.620
Yes, Commander.

25:43.335 --> 25:45.003
A word of advice.

25:45.879 --> 25:48.924
You're 84, you're young,

25:49.508 --> 25:52.135
you have your whole life
ahead of you.

25:52.928 --> 25:55.973
You'll have plenty of missions
to fly, Holly.

26:02.354 --> 26:04.481
And you can be a good officer.

26:05.983 --> 26:08.151
Just don't make this personal.

26:12.281 --> 26:14.783
Let them take care
of the Aculos.

26:27.337 --> 26:29.006
With Artemis Sr. gone...

26:29.173 --> 26:30.299
Let's go with backup.

26:30.465 --> 26:32.968
Domovoi knew
the stakes couldn't be higher.

26:33.135 --> 26:35.596
He knew he would need to
bring in some reinforcements.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.681
Someone he could trust
to watch his back

26:37.764 --> 26:39.725
to help protect Fowl Manor.

26:43.187 --> 26:45.230
There was only one person
he knew

26:45.314 --> 26:47.858
who fully understood
tactical reconnaissance,

26:48.025 --> 26:49.109
Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu,

26:49.193 --> 26:51.403
and the complicated mind
of a 12-year-old.

26:53.530 --> 26:55.824
Another 12-year-old.

26:56.116 --> 26:59.578
His niece, Juliet Butler.

27:02.372 --> 27:03.540
No links found.

27:03.624 --> 27:04.625
Artemis.

27:04.708 --> 27:05.834
The searching's important,

27:05.918 --> 27:07.198
but you can't forget the basics.

27:08.212 --> 27:10.380
- Eat.
- There's no time.

27:10.547 --> 27:11.747
You've done 12 hours straight.

27:11.965 --> 27:13.717
It appears to be nowhere
in this house

27:13.884 --> 27:15.427
- and yet it has to be.
- Zero matches.

27:15.928 --> 27:17.262
You're not giving up, are you?

27:17.429 --> 27:18.430
Of course not.

27:18.514 --> 27:19.782
But I think
I may know the problem.

27:19.806 --> 27:21.934
I'm not the one to find it.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.602
So, how do we summon

27:23.685 --> 27:25.354
this mysterious finder
of Aculoses?

27:26.188 --> 27:28.273
The fairies,
of course. They'll help us.

27:28.774 --> 27:29.858
Will they?

27:30.025 --> 27:31.401
With a bit of persuasion.

27:32.236 --> 27:33.904
And do you know where they are?

27:34.696 --> 27:35.948
In my father's journal,

27:36.031 --> 27:37.241
he wrote of a fairy

27:37.407 --> 27:39.660
who would periodically visit
the oak tree

27:39.743 --> 27:40.994
on the Hill of Tara.

27:41.161 --> 27:42.538
She's our best option,

27:42.621 --> 27:44.998
because their world,
it's too well hidden.

27:45.165 --> 27:46.375
And their books,

27:46.458 --> 27:48.293
it's not
just a different language,

27:48.460 --> 27:49.837
it's encoded.

27:54.591 --> 27:56.677
Of course it's encoded.

27:56.844 --> 27:58.679
By this guy. Foaly.

27:58.846 --> 28:00.889
Fairy tech genius and centaur.

28:00.973 --> 28:01.974
Foaly!

28:02.057 --> 28:03.392
Do not ask him for a ride.

28:03.475 --> 28:04.518
Hello, Holly.

28:04.601 --> 28:05.703
I learned that the hard way.

28:05.727 --> 28:06.937
Commander.

28:07.104 --> 28:08.230
What is it, Foaly?

28:08.397 --> 28:09.565
We have a problem.

28:09.982 --> 28:12.609
One of ours is unaccounted for
on the surface.

28:12.776 --> 28:14.278
Elf? Dwarf? Goblin?

28:14.444 --> 28:17.155
Hard to tell. But it's big.

28:17.489 --> 28:19.491
Could be a deep-tunnel breakout.

28:19.658 --> 28:22.286
Perhaps through a fault
or dormant volcano.

28:22.452 --> 28:24.454
Send someone up to identify it.

28:27.416 --> 28:29.793
All active duty officers
are downtown

28:29.877 --> 28:31.086
searching for the Aculos.

28:34.590 --> 28:36.091
- Officer Short.
- Yes, Commander.

28:36.258 --> 28:37.819
- I'm sending you up there.
- Yes, Commander.

28:37.843 --> 28:39.428
Identify, report,

28:39.511 --> 28:40.991
- but do not engage.
- Yes, Commander.

28:41.096 --> 28:42.097
- Clear?
- Crystal.

28:42.181 --> 28:43.408
- Go, go!
- Thank you, Commander.

28:43.432 --> 28:44.433
Commander.

28:48.061 --> 28:49.771
Two minutes until Lava Launch.

28:49.938 --> 28:52.482
Authorized personnel only
on the launch site.

28:52.649 --> 28:54.809
This is the quickest way
we can take you to the surface

28:54.943 --> 28:56.195
so pay attention.

28:56.361 --> 28:58.780
You'll be sitting on 200,000
tons of molten lava

28:58.989 --> 29:00.824
and traveling at over
600 miles an hour,

29:00.991 --> 29:04.036
so don't get out
until I give the all-clear.

29:04.203 --> 29:05.662
Otherwise, it's...

29:06.246 --> 29:07.831
Goodbye, Holly.
Rest in pieces.

29:07.998 --> 29:09.666
No need to sound
so excited about it.

29:09.833 --> 29:12.336
What can I say?
I just love science.

29:15.088 --> 29:16.757
Um, Foaly?

29:18.300 --> 29:19.301
Boy.

29:30.479 --> 29:31.897
Lava Launch

29:31.980 --> 29:33.524
in 30 seconds and counting.

29:34.900 --> 29:36.568
Stay shielded
once you're up there.

29:37.152 --> 29:39.571
- Total invisibility.
- Yes, Commander.

29:40.364 --> 29:43.158
Magma flare in 12, 11...

29:43.325 --> 29:44.701
The last thing we need

29:44.868 --> 29:47.454
is a fairy sighting
on top of everything else.

29:47.621 --> 29:48.830
Hello, Commander.

29:49.373 --> 29:51.124
This is not the time.

29:51.667 --> 29:54.419
We have an unidentified runner
on the surface.

29:54.586 --> 29:56.088
Hold on
to your breakfast, Holly!

29:56.171 --> 29:57.589
This is gonna be a bumpy ride!

29:58.131 --> 29:59.211
Is this the best we can do?

29:59.967 --> 30:02.678
Send in the daughter of
Beechwood Short, the traitor?

30:02.845 --> 30:04.638
You're not fit to say his name.

30:10.853 --> 30:13.814
Beechwood Short used his magic
to steal the Aculos from us,

30:13.981 --> 30:15.232
which, need I remind you,

30:15.399 --> 30:17.526
is the most precious artifact
in our civilization.

30:18.151 --> 30:19.987
The Aculos was stolen
on your watch.

30:20.153 --> 30:23.031
He has put our entire people
in danger and disappeared.

30:23.198 --> 30:24.533
In my book, that's a traitor.

30:24.700 --> 30:26.702
Get out, Cudgeon,
before I throw you out.

30:26.869 --> 30:29.079
The executors
are watching you, Root.

30:29.955 --> 30:32.583
And I am their eyes and ears.
And I see everything.

30:34.376 --> 30:35.460
Carry on.

30:46.096 --> 30:47.514
Ejecting you now.

30:52.978 --> 30:56.148
Come on! Yes!

31:13.457 --> 31:15.125
Artemis, I'm in position.

31:17.211 --> 31:20.005
Domovoi, anything to report
from the Hill of Tara?

31:22.132 --> 31:24.551
- Yes. I'm freezing.
- Understood.

31:24.718 --> 31:27.262
Now, the oak tree's
where Dad saw that fairy,

31:27.346 --> 31:28.472
and for my plan to work,

31:28.639 --> 31:29.723
we need her.

31:29.890 --> 31:31.391
And what exactly is your plan?

31:31.558 --> 31:32.893
Keep watching.

31:33.060 --> 31:34.144
Trust me.

31:34.311 --> 31:35.521
Copy that.

31:37.731 --> 31:40.567
Head east
towards Martina Franca.

31:42.236 --> 31:44.238
Officer Short,
your orders are to

31:44.321 --> 31:46.615
contain that thing
until Memory Wipe arrives.

31:46.782 --> 31:48.075
Is that understood?

31:48.242 --> 31:49.451
Yes, Commander.

32:06.301 --> 32:08.345
Approaching Martina Franca.

32:55.767 --> 32:57.102
Runner located.

32:57.269 --> 32:59.479
It's a full-sized troll!

32:59.646 --> 33:02.107
Pick on someone your own size!

33:13.035 --> 33:14.512
I want a Time Freeze
around that thing

33:14.536 --> 33:15.871
before anyone gets eaten.

33:16.038 --> 33:17.122
Are you sure, Commander?

33:17.289 --> 33:18.725
We'll need authorization
from the executors.

33:18.749 --> 33:21.168
I'll take
full responsibility. Go!

33:21.335 --> 33:23.003
Time Freeze capsule released!

33:36.433 --> 33:38.018
Do not use magic on that human.

33:38.185 --> 33:39.186
Do you read me?

33:39.353 --> 33:40.437
She's hurt.

33:46.443 --> 33:47.444
Come on.

33:47.611 --> 33:48.612
Come on!

33:50.239 --> 33:51.823
Go! Now!

33:57.204 --> 33:58.497
Time Freeze loading.

33:58.664 --> 34:01.083
Set focus
for interior paralysis only.

34:01.250 --> 34:03.043
Leave these people alone!

34:14.930 --> 34:16.014
Fire.

34:40.455 --> 34:42.124
Retrieval.

34:42.666 --> 34:45.252
Get that thing
back where it belongs

34:45.961 --> 34:47.588
and mind-wipe all those humans

34:47.671 --> 34:50.007
who think they've seen a fairy
or a troll.

35:04.271 --> 35:06.481
L.E.P., begin withdrawal.

35:10.152 --> 35:11.695
Good work, Officer Short.

35:11.778 --> 35:13.488
Now get yourself home
immediately.

35:13.655 --> 35:14.823
Yes, Commander.

35:16.450 --> 35:17.451
That's an order.

35:22.539 --> 35:23.749
Mind wipe complete.

35:23.832 --> 35:25.542
Prepare to release Time Freeze.

36:03.455 --> 36:04.706
Um, Commander Root,

36:04.790 --> 36:07.459
it looks like Holly may be
taking a slight detour.

36:07.626 --> 36:08.794
Officer Short.

36:09.837 --> 36:11.004
Where are you going?

36:11.171 --> 36:13.173
To clear my father's name!

36:13.340 --> 36:15.050
I'll have her badge for this.

36:15.217 --> 36:16.361
That's a bit harsh, isn't it?

36:16.385 --> 36:18.470
Shut up, Foaly,
or I'll have yours, too.

36:20.597 --> 36:22.099
These are dangerous times.

36:22.641 --> 36:23.851
I've lost a friend

36:24.017 --> 36:25.370
and soon,
Artemis will begin to know

36:25.394 --> 36:27.521
the rumors about me
and the thefts.

36:28.063 --> 36:30.232
Is he ready for the truth?

36:30.399 --> 36:31.900
That a darkness threatens

36:31.984 --> 36:33.902
both the human
and the fairy worlds?

36:34.778 --> 36:37.281
When Beechwood came to me,
I knew there was no choice.

36:37.906 --> 36:39.741
The Aculos was being targeted.

36:40.367 --> 36:42.119
In the wrong hands,
it would mean access

36:42.286 --> 36:44.121
to the greatest spells
in fairy lore.

36:44.288 --> 36:47.165
One could teleport armies,
wipe out life.

36:48.333 --> 36:50.836
The wrong hands
are now very close.

36:51.670 --> 36:53.964
They belong
to a brilliant fairy.

36:55.007 --> 36:56.800
Perhaps the greatest
of them all.

36:57.217 --> 36:58.760
But gone to the bad.

36:59.344 --> 37:02.598
Name, Opal Koboi.

37:11.064 --> 37:12.065
You are now approaching

37:12.149 --> 37:13.192
the sacred Hill of Tara.

37:14.151 --> 37:16.486
Coordinates 1-8-3-8-7.

37:16.653 --> 37:18.655
Officer Short!
Return immediate...

37:18.822 --> 37:19.990
Communication disabled.

37:31.627 --> 37:32.669
Wow.

37:38.342 --> 37:40.511
Dom. The fairies.

37:41.136 --> 37:42.513
They're real.

37:47.893 --> 37:49.853
Everything my father said
was true.

38:13.126 --> 38:15.045
Reload. Quick! Quick!

38:16.213 --> 38:17.214
Fire!

38:23.887 --> 38:24.888
We got one.

38:25.889 --> 38:27.367
Holly Short
just dropped off the grid.

38:27.391 --> 38:28.517
I've lost sound and visual.

38:28.684 --> 38:30.143
I warned her not to disobey me.

38:30.644 --> 38:32.104
We can't rule out
an interception.

38:32.271 --> 38:33.939
Give me her last coordinates.

38:34.565 --> 38:36.859
She just arrived on
the Hill of Tara in Ireland.

38:37.025 --> 38:38.068
I checked the maps.

38:38.235 --> 38:40.115
The only human habitation
anywhere near it is...

38:40.195 --> 38:41.280
Fowl Manor.

38:41.446 --> 38:42.447
You know it?

38:43.490 --> 38:45.033
Alert all personnel.

38:46.451 --> 38:48.662
I'm launching
a full-scale recovery.

38:48.996 --> 38:50.916
- All personnel, Commander?
- Land, sea, and air.

38:51.039 --> 38:53.542
There's a fairy unaccounted
for in the real world.

38:53.709 --> 38:55.961
If the humans see it,
we'll lose everything.

38:56.128 --> 38:57.212
Dear me, Root.

38:57.379 --> 38:58.589
Are you losing your touch?

38:58.755 --> 39:00.757
Errant trolls?
Abducted fairies?

39:00.841 --> 39:01.842
Whatever next?

39:01.925 --> 39:03.027
If the executors find out
about this,

39:03.051 --> 39:04.094
you'll be finished.

39:04.178 --> 39:06.597
Get the four-leaf clover
out of here.

39:19.651 --> 39:21.195
Not happy!

39:23.864 --> 39:25.282
And what if
you look one in the eye?

39:25.449 --> 39:26.450
Don't.

39:26.867 --> 39:29.494
They're trained
in arts like telekinesis,

39:29.578 --> 39:31.371
hypnosis, and mesmerism.

39:31.538 --> 39:32.623
Correct.

39:33.373 --> 39:34.374
So?

39:35.083 --> 39:36.376
Defensive options?

39:36.919 --> 39:39.171
Humans should wear
reflective glasses

39:39.338 --> 39:42.174
in order to escape mind control.

39:42.341 --> 39:43.342
Good.

39:43.717 --> 39:45.260
What is unique about dwarves?

39:45.427 --> 39:46.553
Besides digging,

39:46.637 --> 39:48.222
they're master thieves
and pickpockets.

39:48.722 --> 39:49.723
And why?

39:49.848 --> 39:51.034
They're obsessed with treasure

39:51.058 --> 39:52.476
and can't resist
searching for it.

39:57.814 --> 39:58.815
Where am I?

39:58.982 --> 40:00.192
I'm impressed.

40:00.567 --> 40:01.693
You speak English.

40:01.860 --> 40:03.460
Speak English?
Of course I speak English.

40:03.529 --> 40:04.729
I thought you might be hungry.

40:05.072 --> 40:07.074
Look, I don't know
what fairies eat,

40:07.157 --> 40:08.325
but I thought maybe salad?

40:08.492 --> 40:09.535
Yeah, whatever.

40:09.701 --> 40:12.496
I bet you have beautiful eyes.

40:13.080 --> 40:14.957
I wish I could see them.

40:15.123 --> 40:16.291
That's not going to work.

40:16.458 --> 40:17.626
We've got protection.

40:17.793 --> 40:19.273
Who are you?
What do you want from me?

40:19.336 --> 40:20.379
You're part of the plan.

40:20.546 --> 40:22.005
- Who's in charge here?
- I am.

40:22.172 --> 40:23.382
You're just a child.

40:23.549 --> 40:25.259
Welcome to Fowl Manor,
Officer Short.

40:25.676 --> 40:27.886
- How do you know my name?
- It's on your helmet.

40:28.053 --> 40:29.263
But it's in Gnomish.

40:29.429 --> 40:31.181
Correct.
I've read all about you.

40:31.348 --> 40:32.724
You've what?

40:32.891 --> 40:35.686
I'm here to officially
invite you into my home.

40:35.853 --> 40:37.646
Invite me? You just shot me!

40:37.813 --> 40:39.565
You must now do
whatever I demand.

40:40.023 --> 40:41.692
You'll have to
keep me here forever.

40:41.859 --> 40:43.443
If that's what you want.

40:43.610 --> 40:44.945
You'll never get away with this.

40:45.112 --> 40:46.572
My people will come for me.

40:48.490 --> 40:50.784
That's what I hoped you'd say.

40:51.618 --> 40:52.870
This isn't over.

40:53.036 --> 40:54.496
You expect us to believe

40:54.580 --> 40:56.331
he did something this dangerous?

40:56.498 --> 40:59.668
He captured a living fairy.
What do you think?

40:59.835 --> 41:01.920
Try to imagine
if humans suddenly found out

41:02.004 --> 41:03.484
there was a world
of magical creatures

41:03.547 --> 41:04.673
living beneath them.

41:04.840 --> 41:06.550
Most human beings
are afraid of gluten.

41:06.717 --> 41:08.594
How do you think
they'd handle goblins?

41:08.760 --> 41:12.598
Artemis wanted the Aculos
to save his father's life.

41:12.764 --> 41:14.183
And at last, his master plan

41:14.266 --> 41:15.684
was starting to fall into place.

41:15.851 --> 41:17.269
He had his first piece.

41:17.436 --> 41:18.520
Bait.

41:18.687 --> 41:20.814
But now,
a storm was coming his way.

41:21.273 --> 41:22.816
And the fate
of both of our worlds

41:22.900 --> 41:25.861
was in the hands
of young Artemis Fowl.

41:36.747 --> 41:39.166
Artemis. Dom.

41:40.125 --> 41:42.169
It's like
the whole world is ending.

41:42.336 --> 41:43.629
The fairies are doing it.

41:43.712 --> 41:45.255
They're creating a Time Freeze.

41:45.422 --> 41:46.757
I beg your pardon?

41:46.924 --> 41:48.342
It's a kind of temporal vacuum

41:48.509 --> 41:50.761
that they create
so they can operate

41:50.844 --> 41:52.262
unseen by the human eye.

41:52.429 --> 41:54.890
I read about it
in Dad's journal.

41:55.057 --> 41:56.225
It's formidable.

41:56.391 --> 41:58.727
Einstein and Hawking were right.

41:58.894 --> 42:00.437
Time is bending all over.

42:00.604 --> 42:02.189
Anything could happen now.

42:02.356 --> 42:03.774
Anything's possible.

42:03.941 --> 42:05.025
And while it holds,

42:05.108 --> 42:06.860
the perfect conditions
for an attack.

42:07.027 --> 42:08.278
Exactly.

42:14.076 --> 42:15.661
We just picked up
your friends arriving.

42:15.827 --> 42:16.995
Can't wait to meet them.

42:17.162 --> 42:18.539
You won't even see them.

42:18.705 --> 42:20.624
Whatever you're planning
will fail.

42:20.707 --> 42:22.376
Fairies do not negotiate.

42:24.545 --> 42:26.255
You can't win!

42:26.421 --> 42:27.923
We'll see about that.

42:33.470 --> 42:34.555
Sweet.

42:35.347 --> 42:36.682
Incredible.

42:43.480 --> 42:44.731
En garde!

42:45.649 --> 42:47.568
You are so dead.

42:47.734 --> 42:49.528
The pair of you.

42:50.696 --> 42:53.240
Foaly,
I need that Time Freeze now.

42:53.407 --> 42:54.575
Exterior only.

42:54.741 --> 42:56.285
I need the inside to be alive.

42:56.451 --> 42:57.786
I have to talk to that kid.

42:57.953 --> 43:00.163
Receiver dishes
in position, check.

43:31.987 --> 43:33.614
Time Freeze successful!

44:27.876 --> 44:29.294
Top of the mornin'.

44:33.966 --> 44:35.217
They're coming for her.

44:35.551 --> 44:38.095
Artemis, do you really think
this is going to work?

44:38.178 --> 44:39.221
Who knows?

44:39.721 --> 44:41.265
I'm going to need the suit.

44:50.274 --> 44:51.775
Send in the advance team.

44:51.942 --> 44:52.943
Yes, Commander.

44:55.696 --> 44:57.114
Capture only.

44:57.197 --> 44:59.825
We need the humans unharmed.

44:59.992 --> 45:02.411
We scare them.
We do not kill them.

45:02.578 --> 45:03.787
I want them alive.

45:05.914 --> 45:07.207
Scared, Artemis?

45:07.374 --> 45:08.792
A little bit.

45:08.959 --> 45:11.628
But I prefer scared to dead,
if possible.

45:11.795 --> 45:12.963
I agree.

45:13.130 --> 45:14.590
If possible.

45:14.756 --> 45:16.425
- What are they doing?
- Unarmed?

45:16.592 --> 45:18.051
Against all of us?

45:18.135 --> 45:19.136
Take the shot!

45:19.219 --> 45:20.262
Stop them!

45:20.345 --> 45:21.625
They have Officer Short's
weapon.

45:27.519 --> 45:29.813
Behind you, Dom!

45:37.029 --> 45:38.197
No!

45:39.072 --> 45:41.116
Shoot the Time Freeze capsule!

45:41.909 --> 45:43.202
Take the shot!

45:53.754 --> 45:55.380
He's
destabilized the Time Freeze.

45:55.547 --> 45:57.049
How long do we have?

45:57.216 --> 45:59.259
I can try to patch it,
but it's not going to hold!

45:59.426 --> 46:01.470
This is serious.
Whatever you're going to do,

46:01.553 --> 46:02.763
you need to do it fast.

46:06.266 --> 46:07.768
Send in someone to negotiate.

46:07.935 --> 46:09.937
You have five minutes.

46:10.103 --> 46:11.104
No.

46:14.483 --> 46:18.111
Well, it appears
your clever little son

46:18.195 --> 46:20.197
has kidnapped a fairy.

46:20.364 --> 46:23.200
He has your flair
for the dramatic.

46:23.367 --> 46:25.285
Why are you doing this?

46:25.410 --> 46:28.705
Why?
It's very simple.

46:28.872 --> 46:30.207
Revenge.

46:31.250 --> 46:34.419
Not only did your people
wage war on mine,

46:34.586 --> 46:37.756
considered yourself superior
in every way,

46:37.923 --> 46:39.883
mocked us, reviled us,

46:39.967 --> 46:42.261
dismissed us
as the little people,

46:42.594 --> 46:44.555
but as soon as we were gone,

46:44.638 --> 46:47.975
you reduced us further
to silly stories.

46:48.141 --> 46:51.687
To have people laugh at us,
or to frighten the children.

46:51.854 --> 46:53.313
You can't win.

46:53.397 --> 46:55.524
You underestimate your people
and mine.

46:56.316 --> 46:57.693
Fairies and humans

46:57.776 --> 46:59.611
are incapable of friendship.

46:59.778 --> 47:01.446
Incapable of coexistence.

47:02.322 --> 47:04.491
With the Aculos,
I will rise to the surface

47:04.658 --> 47:06.493
then release my army
to take over the Earth

47:06.577 --> 47:08.287
and own both worlds

47:08.453 --> 47:11.540
and systematically wipe out
all of mankind.

47:11.707 --> 47:14.668
Then, I will restore fairies
to their rightful place

47:14.835 --> 47:17.212
as humanity crumbles beneath us.

47:17.713 --> 47:19.423
Some said I was mad.

47:19.590 --> 47:21.175
They wouldn't listen to me.

47:21.341 --> 47:22.342
Guess what?

47:23.010 --> 47:25.304
They're listening now.

47:31.685 --> 47:33.687
My name is Commander Root.

47:35.105 --> 47:36.523
I invite you into my house.

47:36.940 --> 47:39.318
Nice try.

47:39.776 --> 47:41.320
I'm here to negotiate.

47:42.654 --> 47:44.031
Who's in charge here?

47:44.156 --> 47:45.157
I am.

47:45.324 --> 47:46.867
You're only ten years old.

47:47.034 --> 47:49.286
Twelve. How old are you?

47:50.329 --> 47:51.997
If you must know,

47:52.998 --> 47:56.251
I'm going to be 803 in May.

47:56.418 --> 47:57.669
What's your name?

47:57.836 --> 47:58.962
Artemis Fowl.

48:03.842 --> 48:05.677
So, that explains it.

48:05.844 --> 48:08.931
You Fowls have been giving us
trouble for centuries.

48:09.097 --> 48:11.767
Where's your thieving father
these days?

48:11.934 --> 48:14.019
I wouldn't worry about that.

48:14.353 --> 48:16.813
Now, listen carefully,
Artemis Fowl.

48:17.606 --> 48:21.652
Unless you release
Officer Short immediately,

48:21.735 --> 48:23.487
I'll destroy this house
and everyone in it.

48:24.071 --> 48:26.865
And I will expose
your existence to the world.

48:27.032 --> 48:29.284
You can't.
You're in a Time Freeze.

48:29.451 --> 48:30.953
You can't get out.

48:31.119 --> 48:33.080
But only for another 27 minutes.

48:33.247 --> 48:35.207
Commander, here are my terms.

48:35.958 --> 48:39.628
Bring me the Aculos,
and Officer Short goes free.

48:39.795 --> 48:41.046
I beg your pardon?

48:41.213 --> 48:42.631
You heard me. The Aculos.

48:42.798 --> 48:44.383
In one of those pots.

48:44.550 --> 48:46.301
From under a rainbow, I presume.

48:46.969 --> 48:51.139
I warn you,
we do not pay ransoms.

48:51.306 --> 48:53.559
We never have,
and we never will.

48:53.725 --> 48:55.644
You might just want
to reconsider that.

48:56.061 --> 48:58.188
I'll give you 15 minutes.

48:58.605 --> 49:00.899
And in case you're thinking
of storming the house,

49:01.066 --> 49:04.069
no fairies are allowed
to enter it while I'm alive.

49:04.862 --> 49:08.866
As you say.
While you're alive.

49:12.160 --> 49:14.204
Who is this child?

49:14.371 --> 49:16.290
I think he said
he was Artemis Fowl, Jr.

49:16.456 --> 49:17.541
Shut up, Foaly.

49:17.708 --> 49:20.085
Can't anyone ask a rhetorical
question around here?

49:20.252 --> 49:22.355
But he's going to find out
we don't even have the Aculos

49:22.379 --> 49:24.299
and we can't storm the house.
That's fairy rules.

49:24.339 --> 49:26.633
He never said anything
about dwarves.

49:26.800 --> 49:29.178
Remember what I said about
not underestimating the kid?

49:29.344 --> 49:31.305
Well, here's exactly why.

49:31.471 --> 49:33.891
The next piece of his plan
was set in motion.

49:34.057 --> 49:35.934
Knowing the fairies
couldn't enter Fowl Manor,

49:36.101 --> 49:38.520
he forced their hand and set
the stage for the entrance

49:38.687 --> 49:41.273
of the true hero of our tale.

49:41.773 --> 49:44.651
Well, if you ask me, that is.

49:46.695 --> 49:48.447
Get me Mulch Diggums.

49:51.116 --> 49:54.077
The kid's plan
was fiendishly clever.

49:54.536 --> 49:55.954
He just had to get me
in the house

49:56.038 --> 49:58.290
because he knew the truth
about dwarves.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.793
We can't resist treasure,

50:01.960 --> 50:04.421
which is what brought me back
to this cozy little jail cell.

50:04.588 --> 50:06.798
See, this was my third time
in Howler's Peak,

50:06.882 --> 50:09.092
the worst prison in Haven City.

50:09.259 --> 50:12.095
My first time in,
I did 164 years.

50:12.262 --> 50:14.556
But this time,
I came with music,

50:14.640 --> 50:16.725
courtesy of Officer Holly Short.

50:37.955 --> 50:40.040
1984, Foreigner!

50:40.207 --> 50:41.959
It's a real classic.

50:42.751 --> 50:44.753
You know,
if you like human music.

50:45.546 --> 50:47.631
You seem like
more of a glam kind of guy.

50:48.131 --> 50:49.591
What are you looking at, dwarf?

50:49.758 --> 50:51.260
Your eyes.

50:52.719 --> 50:56.849
Just wondering
what thoughts lie behind

50:57.432 --> 50:59.017
those two impenetrable windows.

51:02.688 --> 51:04.940
So, you like eating dirt.

51:05.482 --> 51:10.070
Well, I don't know
if "like" is the right term.

51:10.237 --> 51:11.905
Tunneling is kinda something
I have to do.

51:11.989 --> 51:14.283
It's an occupational hazard.

51:14.449 --> 51:17.578
Just don't stand behind you
while you're doing it, right?

51:25.419 --> 51:27.671
So, this just got awkward.

51:28.130 --> 51:29.923
Are you laughin' at me, dwarf?

51:30.090 --> 51:31.175
At you? No.

51:31.341 --> 51:32.968
I was just following
their social cues.

51:33.135 --> 51:34.219
Because I'm not laughing.

51:34.386 --> 51:35.387
Yeah, I can tell.

51:36.013 --> 51:37.097
Wow.

51:38.682 --> 51:39.850
Guards.

51:40.017 --> 51:41.393
They're really
understaffed here.

51:42.144 --> 51:43.187
Hi.

51:46.064 --> 51:48.025
Do you like fire, too?

51:48.192 --> 51:50.444
No. Not so much. That's...

51:50.903 --> 51:54.573
So you know,
no dwarf really likes fire.

51:54.740 --> 51:56.158
Careful, careful.

51:56.325 --> 51:58.202
We could all go up in flames.

51:58.368 --> 51:59.369
Not us.

51:59.536 --> 52:02.372
Our skin
is completely fireproof.

52:02.539 --> 52:04.583
That's right, isn't it?
Forgot about that.

52:05.209 --> 52:07.961
Your skin may be fireproof,

52:08.629 --> 52:10.380
but what about your brain?

52:15.552 --> 52:16.637
Mulch Diggums!

52:17.930 --> 52:19.264
Commander Root wants to see you.

52:19.723 --> 52:21.391
Exceptional timing.

52:25.938 --> 52:26.939
Goodbye, gentlemen.

52:34.488 --> 52:36.406
So, I just spoke to your boss.

52:36.490 --> 52:37.699
I think she got the message.

52:37.866 --> 52:39.785
How are you
expecting this to end?

52:39.952 --> 52:41.328
With me getting what I want.

52:41.495 --> 52:42.913
Which is what, exactly?

52:43.080 --> 52:44.414
My father's safe return.

52:44.790 --> 52:47.709
This has nothing to do
with your father.

52:47.876 --> 52:49.169
Look at you with that grin.

52:49.628 --> 52:51.380
Thinking you're
outsmarting everyone

52:51.463 --> 52:53.799
in your little suit
and sunglasses.

52:53.966 --> 52:56.093
You're enjoying all this.

52:56.260 --> 52:58.428
You think it's a game.

52:58.554 --> 52:59.555
Game?

52:59.638 --> 53:00.973
My father was kidnapped.

53:01.139 --> 53:02.891
My father is dead.

53:04.393 --> 53:05.769
Can I trust you?

53:06.144 --> 53:07.938
You'll have to.
You have no choice.

53:12.442 --> 53:13.610
How did he die?

53:14.152 --> 53:15.779
It was on the Hill of Tara.

53:16.321 --> 53:18.657
He was ambushed
by one of our kind

53:19.700 --> 53:22.995
because he'd stolen
something called the Aculos.

53:23.871 --> 53:26.582
I've read in my father's
journals about the Aculos.

53:27.875 --> 53:30.169
About a fairy
who swore to protect it.

53:30.335 --> 53:31.753
A fairy named Beechwood.

53:32.379 --> 53:34.756
Beechwood Short was my father.

53:36.842 --> 53:39.761
He knew how dangerous
the Aculos can be.

53:39.928 --> 53:41.972
It can open portals
between worlds.

53:42.139 --> 53:44.349
A skeleton key
for the whole universe.

53:44.516 --> 53:45.726
He hid it.

53:45.893 --> 53:49.021
And for that, some say
that he was a criminal.

53:49.188 --> 53:50.731
That's what they say
about my dad.

53:52.941 --> 53:54.776
But you know it's not true.

54:00.657 --> 54:03.911
That hurt!

54:12.336 --> 54:14.588
Artemis, it looks like
we've got another visitor.

54:19.051 --> 54:21.720
Commander, Time Freeze
integrity down to 60%.

54:24.806 --> 54:25.849
Understood.

54:26.016 --> 54:27.726
Hold it together, Foaly.

54:31.563 --> 54:32.689
Mulch.

54:33.857 --> 54:35.609
This is a one-time offer.

54:35.776 --> 54:37.986
Fifty years off your sentence

54:38.153 --> 54:39.988
if you'll dig your way
into Fowl Manor

54:40.072 --> 54:41.615
and bring out Officer Short.

54:41.782 --> 54:43.367
Commander Root,

54:43.534 --> 54:44.993
do you mind if I call you...

54:45.827 --> 54:47.454
I actually don't know
your first name.

54:47.621 --> 54:49.289
Let me guess. Britney.

54:50.040 --> 54:51.416
I'm way off, aren't I?

54:52.042 --> 54:53.293
It appears to me

54:53.377 --> 54:55.587
like you've got a big problem
on your hands.

54:55.671 --> 54:56.713
But?

54:56.839 --> 54:59.633
Has anyone ever told you
you're like David Bowie

54:59.800 --> 55:01.593
if David Bowie were a fairy?

55:01.760 --> 55:04.513
So, essentially,
you're David Bowie.

55:05.013 --> 55:06.241
Do you think
the humans will ever

55:06.265 --> 55:07.474
find out he was one of us?

55:07.891 --> 55:09.142
Anyway,

55:09.309 --> 55:12.187
50 years off my sentence
just isn't gonna cut it here.

55:12.938 --> 55:14.815
I know what you want.
I can't give you that.

55:14.982 --> 55:16.692
Come on, Root.

55:16.859 --> 55:18.193
Please.

55:18.360 --> 55:20.112
I just...
I just want to be small.

55:20.863 --> 55:24.032
I just want to be normal,
like the rest of my kind.

55:25.075 --> 55:26.827
To be accepted.

55:28.161 --> 55:30.706
You fairies got magic
coming out of your ears.

55:30.873 --> 55:32.040
What have I got?

55:32.207 --> 55:34.751
Three, four feet I don't need.

55:34.918 --> 55:36.604
Look, a giant dwarf is exactly
what I need right now.

55:36.628 --> 55:37.754
What I need right now.

55:37.921 --> 55:40.424
A big, fast, hungry tunneler

55:40.507 --> 55:42.426
who'll dig their way
into that house.

55:42.593 --> 55:44.011
It's your choice.

55:44.178 --> 55:47.347
Either bring out Officer Short
or get back to jail.

55:48.390 --> 55:50.100
Listen to the two of us

55:50.267 --> 55:51.351
grunting at each other

55:51.435 --> 55:54.062
like a pair of hippos
with a throat infection.

55:55.981 --> 55:57.357
A criminal?

55:57.524 --> 55:59.401
A criminal.
That's what you think I am?

56:00.652 --> 56:03.614
I am so much more
than a criminal.

56:04.823 --> 56:08.994
Um, technically, most of what
I do is criminal activity,

56:09.161 --> 56:11.371
but I'm also an artist.

56:13.957 --> 56:15.792
You're picking my pocket.

56:17.336 --> 56:18.879
Okay. A hundred years
off my sentence

56:18.962 --> 56:20.282
and a single cell
with no goblins.

56:20.464 --> 56:21.965
Single cell and 55 years.

56:22.132 --> 56:23.133
- Seventy-five.
- Sixty.

56:23.300 --> 56:25.052
- Seventy-four.
- Done. Officers!

56:25.469 --> 56:27.638
You reading me, Mulch?

56:27.804 --> 56:29.806
Loud and clear, horsey.

56:31.016 --> 56:33.769
Dwarfus Giaganticus.

56:35.103 --> 56:37.439
Dwarfus Giaganticus.

56:40.192 --> 56:41.193
Everybody,

56:41.485 --> 56:42.903
stand back.

56:47.491 --> 56:49.284
It's feeding time.

57:14.476 --> 57:15.602
I'm in.

57:18.313 --> 57:20.107
I know that sound.

57:20.274 --> 57:21.775
Mulch Diggums.

57:26.238 --> 57:27.239
Mulch,

57:27.322 --> 57:28.949
I'm switching
your iris-cam to X-ray.

57:29.116 --> 57:30.868
That's good.
You do you, Foaly.

57:31.034 --> 57:33.203
You might feel a slight pinch.

57:33.662 --> 57:36.164
- You son of a...
- Sorry!

57:36.331 --> 57:38.292
What would your parents be?

57:38.959 --> 57:40.794
We have a visitor.

57:41.211 --> 57:42.421
What is it?

57:43.839 --> 57:45.924
It's in the portrait gallery.

57:46.967 --> 57:49.052
It's like a really, really

57:49.219 --> 57:50.637
big dwarf.

57:54.433 --> 57:55.434
Yes.

57:55.601 --> 57:56.977
Right on schedule.

57:57.394 --> 57:59.479
Well, if I was
gonna be manipulated,

57:59.563 --> 58:01.148
might as well be by the best.

58:01.315 --> 58:04.902
And make no mistake,
the kid is the best.

58:05.068 --> 58:08.363
House marks the spot.

58:11.700 --> 58:13.368
What have we here?

58:25.631 --> 58:28.175
The TXTL 5000.

58:28.342 --> 58:29.885
He's discovered a safe.

58:30.052 --> 58:31.220
Let him open it.

58:31.386 --> 58:32.888
That's exactly what I want.

58:40.020 --> 58:41.396
We meet again.

58:44.107 --> 58:45.943
So, they've sent in a dwarf.

58:46.109 --> 58:47.694
Look, I need your help.

58:49.571 --> 58:51.532
Listen, if I let you out,

58:51.698 --> 58:53.618
will you promise not to
take command of my brain?

58:53.784 --> 58:56.036
I want nothing to do
with that brain.

59:08.549 --> 59:09.550
And...

59:17.140 --> 59:18.141
Bingo!

59:19.518 --> 59:20.811
Temperamental.

59:21.520 --> 59:23.230
You've evolved.

59:24.314 --> 59:25.732
But so have I.

59:28.151 --> 59:30.404
Sounds like you're not
the only one opening locks.

59:30.988 --> 59:32.447
By the way, if you run,

59:32.531 --> 59:34.908
I will expose your existence
to the world.

59:37.035 --> 59:38.537
You are my guest.

59:39.162 --> 59:42.040
I invited you in.
The rules are clear.

59:42.624 --> 59:45.878
They are, but you think
you can trust me?

59:49.923 --> 59:50.966
Now you can trust me.

59:51.800 --> 59:52.968
Fair enough.

59:53.135 --> 59:54.636
Let's find that dwarf.

59:55.554 --> 59:58.265
Eight new
motion-sensitive tumblers.

59:58.432 --> 1:00:00.100
You devil.

1:00:04.521 --> 1:00:05.772
It can't be.

1:00:06.648 --> 1:00:08.233
Holy moly!

1:00:17.659 --> 1:00:19.286
Step back, Mr. Diggums.

1:00:19.870 --> 1:00:22.414
It's real.
It's perfect.

1:00:22.581 --> 1:00:23.582
The Aculos.

1:00:24.082 --> 1:00:27.169
The most powerful treasure
in the fairy world.

1:00:35.886 --> 1:00:37.054
Don't.

1:00:38.180 --> 1:00:40.224
It will kill you if you use it.

1:00:41.016 --> 1:00:42.559
If any human does.

1:00:43.977 --> 1:00:45.938
I don't need to use it.

1:00:46.104 --> 1:00:48.504
Because my bargaining position
just got a whole lot stronger.

1:00:48.649 --> 1:00:51.235
The fairies outside mustn't
get to hear that we have this.

1:00:51.735 --> 1:00:53.529
I'm sorry, human,

1:00:54.321 --> 1:00:56.156
but they already know.

1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:08.585
There's been a development?

1:01:08.752 --> 1:01:10.170
They found the Aculos.

1:01:10.337 --> 1:01:11.839
As I expected.

1:01:12.005 --> 1:01:13.298
In Fowl Manor.

1:01:13.465 --> 1:01:14.925
You know what to do.

1:01:15.050 --> 1:01:16.051
It's risky.

1:01:16.218 --> 1:01:18.262
Root has our entire army
at her disposal.

1:01:18.428 --> 1:01:20.639
It's quite simple, Cudgeon.

1:01:21.056 --> 1:01:23.141
If you wish to survive

1:01:23.225 --> 1:01:25.811
and thrive
in my brave new world,

1:01:25.978 --> 1:01:28.230
then you will intervene now.

1:01:32.693 --> 1:01:34.069
Commander!

1:01:35.320 --> 1:01:37.281
This Time Freeze
is seriously unstable.

1:01:37.739 --> 1:01:39.241
This may not hold.

1:01:42.703 --> 1:01:43.704
We've lost one!

1:01:51.628 --> 1:01:53.881
Commander Root,

1:01:54.047 --> 1:01:55.984
you are hereby officially
relieved of your command

1:01:56.008 --> 1:01:57.634
on authorization
of the executors.

1:01:57.801 --> 1:01:59.928
You're making a mistake,
Cudgeon.

1:02:00.095 --> 1:02:02.973
My only mistake was not
doing this a long time ago.

1:02:03.348 --> 1:02:06.727
With the Aculos in play,
the game has changed.

1:02:07.394 --> 1:02:09.354
Time for a little direct action,

1:02:09.438 --> 1:02:10.689
don't you think?

1:02:10.856 --> 1:02:12.482
Let me show you how it's done.

1:02:13.358 --> 1:02:14.358
Knock it off!

1:02:15.235 --> 1:02:16.320
Mistake.

1:02:16.820 --> 1:02:19.198
I mean, really, big mistake.

1:02:23.577 --> 1:02:25.245
This should wrap things up.

1:02:26.163 --> 1:02:28.373
Recognize our new recruit?

1:02:29.041 --> 1:02:33.337
We fed it a little potion
of nettles and wasp juice.

1:02:33.504 --> 1:02:35.881
Everything trolls
are allergic to.

1:02:36.048 --> 1:02:40.844
It's made it twice as strong
and 10 times as mad.

1:02:48.435 --> 1:02:49.436
D'arvit!

1:02:59.404 --> 1:03:01.114
That can't be good.

1:03:05.661 --> 1:03:06.662
Go!

1:03:06.745 --> 1:03:07.829
Come on, let's go!

1:03:07.996 --> 1:03:09.039
Come on!

1:03:13.919 --> 1:03:15.003
Gods alive.

1:03:15.170 --> 1:03:16.171
What is that?

1:03:16.296 --> 1:03:19.925
A creature that consumes
humans in 2.97 seconds

1:03:20.092 --> 1:03:22.052
and fairies in less than one.

1:03:22.219 --> 1:03:23.428
Get ready.

1:03:23.595 --> 1:03:25.264
This is going all the way.

1:03:29.017 --> 1:03:30.477
I'll need my gun.

1:03:47.160 --> 1:03:48.954
Jam all magic in the house.

1:03:49.371 --> 1:03:51.211
But Officer Short,
she'll need hers to survive.

1:03:51.373 --> 1:03:53.041
Her father used his magic
against us.

1:03:53.250 --> 1:03:55.711
I'm not making the same
mistake twice. Do as I say.

1:03:59.965 --> 1:04:01.383
I didn't read much on trolls.

1:04:01.466 --> 1:04:02.718
Anything I should look out for?

1:04:02.801 --> 1:04:03.802
The teeth.

1:04:05.846 --> 1:04:07.556
Good to know.

1:04:13.645 --> 1:04:16.023
All magic
in the house is now jammed.

1:04:19.401 --> 1:04:20.652
Everything okay?

1:04:22.946 --> 1:04:23.989
Sure.

1:04:35.792 --> 1:04:37.628
Help! I'm stuck!
Get me out!

1:04:41.673 --> 1:04:43.091
I'll distract him!

1:04:52.226 --> 1:04:53.602
Help! I'm stuck!

1:04:54.269 --> 1:04:56.230
Mulch, help.

1:04:59.566 --> 1:05:00.651
Juliet, look out!

1:05:02.694 --> 1:05:05.155
It's okay, I've got this!
Juliet, run!

1:05:05.322 --> 1:05:06.657
Run, Juliet! Run!

1:05:06.823 --> 1:05:08.534
Come and get some,
you big meanie!

1:05:13.580 --> 1:05:14.581
Help!

1:05:14.665 --> 1:05:15.707
Quick! Quick!

1:05:15.791 --> 1:05:16.834
I'm reaching!

1:05:16.917 --> 1:05:17.960
Gotcha!

1:05:28.262 --> 1:05:29.471
Artemis!

1:05:32.266 --> 1:05:34.101
No! No!

1:05:42.901 --> 1:05:43.902
Mulch!

1:05:43.986 --> 1:05:45.612
I could use a little help!

1:05:51.201 --> 1:05:52.786
Good.

1:05:53.120 --> 1:05:54.162
Hi!

1:05:55.205 --> 1:05:56.206
Okay.

1:05:56.373 --> 1:05:58.458
Let me just put this away.

1:06:02.462 --> 1:06:04.173
Artemis, run!

1:06:04.339 --> 1:06:05.619
I'll see you guys
on the balcony!

1:06:08.135 --> 1:06:10.012
Juliet! Jump!

1:06:10.095 --> 1:06:12.598
Holly!

1:06:24.276 --> 1:06:25.277
Dom!

1:06:25.360 --> 1:06:26.403
Holly!

1:06:26.570 --> 1:06:27.779
Holly! Holly!

1:06:32.618 --> 1:06:34.328
Dom!

1:06:38.790 --> 1:06:39.791
Let go!

1:06:46.882 --> 1:06:49.051
D'arvit!

1:06:55.349 --> 1:06:56.725
Artemis! Jump!

1:07:04.441 --> 1:07:05.484
Help!

1:07:05.567 --> 1:07:07.653
I'm trying!
I'm trying!

1:07:11.573 --> 1:07:13.116
Juliet, run!

1:07:27.047 --> 1:07:28.048
Dom!

1:07:30.008 --> 1:07:31.176
Pull!

1:07:56.285 --> 1:07:58.036
Holly, look out!

1:08:02.207 --> 1:08:03.625
I'll get the gun!

1:08:11.133 --> 1:08:12.634
Artemis!

1:08:21.810 --> 1:08:23.854
Dom! No!

1:08:27.900 --> 1:08:28.901
My.

1:08:31.820 --> 1:08:32.821
Go!

1:08:32.988 --> 1:08:34.823
Get help!
Try the phones again!

1:08:34.907 --> 1:08:35.908
Now!

1:08:37.910 --> 1:08:39.703
Domovoi? Dom?

1:08:49.379 --> 1:08:50.797
The Time Freeze is collapsing.

1:08:50.964 --> 1:08:52.466
I can't hold it any longer.

1:08:52.633 --> 1:08:54.092
There goes another fairy!

1:09:09.608 --> 1:09:10.609
Help him!

1:09:10.776 --> 1:09:12.694
I can't.
They've blocked my magic.

1:09:13.320 --> 1:09:14.404
Artemis,

1:09:15.155 --> 1:09:17.616
there's nothing
I can do for him.

1:09:19.743 --> 1:09:20.911
Hold on, buddy.

1:09:21.078 --> 1:09:22.412
In kendo,

1:09:23.205 --> 1:09:25.624
we call it kiri oroshi.

1:09:26.667 --> 1:09:28.544
- "The fatal blow."
- No.

1:09:29.795 --> 1:09:31.505
You did great back there.

1:09:31.964 --> 1:09:34.550
Really. All the Butlers
will be proud of you.

1:09:36.009 --> 1:09:37.636
Goodbye, my friend.

1:09:56.280 --> 1:09:59.283
May the road rise up
to meet you.

1:10:00.409 --> 1:10:02.661
May the wind
be always at your back.

1:10:03.412 --> 1:10:06.415
May the sun shine
warm upon your face.

1:10:09.543 --> 1:10:12.713
May the rains fall soft
upon your fields.

1:10:13.297 --> 1:10:15.424
And until we meet again,

1:10:15.591 --> 1:10:18.260
may a friend be always near.

1:10:21.722 --> 1:10:23.322
No sign of
further activity in the house.

1:10:23.348 --> 1:10:24.868
Five more minutes,
then we're going in.

1:10:24.892 --> 1:10:26.018
Request permission to

1:10:26.101 --> 1:10:27.328
restore
Officer Short's magic, sir.

1:10:27.352 --> 1:10:28.478
Permission denied.

1:10:28.645 --> 1:10:29.938
It could save her life!

1:10:30.105 --> 1:10:31.899
She's a traitor,
just like her father.

1:10:32.065 --> 1:10:33.233
No, she's one of us!

1:10:33.400 --> 1:10:34.401
Commander Root.

1:10:35.277 --> 1:10:37.571
I didn't make you captain
for nothing.

1:10:40.490 --> 1:10:41.533
Don't you dare!

1:10:41.700 --> 1:10:42.910
Squad!

1:10:43.076 --> 1:10:45.162
Unblock magic!

1:10:52.211 --> 1:10:53.378
Come on!

1:10:53.545 --> 1:10:55.422
Artemis, look out!

1:10:57.591 --> 1:10:58.800
Come on.

1:10:59.801 --> 1:11:01.553
Come on, Domovoi!

1:11:02.888 --> 1:11:04.056
You're back!

1:11:05.098 --> 1:11:06.892
Holly brought you back!

1:11:13.732 --> 1:11:15.567
I didn't cry, did I?

1:11:18.195 --> 1:11:19.738
Little bit.

1:11:25.118 --> 1:11:27.454
The Time Freeze is
gonna collapse any second now.

1:11:27.621 --> 1:11:29.873
All L.E.P. personnel,
evacuate.

1:11:33.585 --> 1:11:34.586
Mulch!

1:11:34.753 --> 1:11:36.713
The Aculos.
Do you still have it?

1:11:36.880 --> 1:11:38.090
Yeah, sure.

1:11:38.257 --> 1:11:39.341
Right there.

1:11:43.011 --> 1:11:44.012
Good.

1:11:44.471 --> 1:11:46.139
I have a plan.

1:11:52.521 --> 1:11:53.522
That's it.

1:11:53.689 --> 1:11:55.190
Temporal convergence
at maximum force.

1:11:55.357 --> 1:11:57.150
Time bend start now.

1:11:57.317 --> 1:11:58.443
Distortion, elastication,

1:11:58.527 --> 1:12:00.237
and space grabs coming your way.

1:12:00.404 --> 1:12:01.530
For your own sakes,

1:12:01.613 --> 1:12:03.323
get out of there now
and get home safe.

1:12:03.490 --> 1:12:05.784
This Time Freeze is gonna blow!

1:12:20.883 --> 1:12:21.967
Officer Short!

1:12:22.134 --> 1:12:23.760
Get out of there now.

1:12:23.927 --> 1:12:26.555
Leave the humans.
Save yourself!

1:12:35.731 --> 1:12:37.566
Artemis, what's happening?

1:12:37.858 --> 1:12:39.109
Take cover!

1:12:55.918 --> 1:12:56.919
Whoa!

1:12:57.252 --> 1:12:58.253
Watch out!

1:12:58.420 --> 1:12:59.900
Come on,
we've got to get out of here!

1:13:00.923 --> 1:13:01.924
We gotta get out...

1:13:02.090 --> 1:13:03.759
See you on the other side!

1:13:03.926 --> 1:13:05.219
Mulch, get out of here!

1:13:09.556 --> 1:13:10.599
Everybody!

1:13:10.766 --> 1:13:12.309
Take cover!

1:13:12.392 --> 1:13:14.061
Whoa!

1:13:20.734 --> 1:13:22.528
Holly, this is your last chance.

1:13:22.694 --> 1:13:23.862
You can't save him.

1:13:24.029 --> 1:13:25.864
Just get out of there now.

1:13:52.891 --> 1:13:55.227
And now,
the final piece of the plan.

1:13:55.686 --> 1:13:57.121
The Time Freeze is ended.
They're gone.

1:13:57.145 --> 1:13:58.146
Did we win?

1:13:58.230 --> 1:13:59.565
Not yet. I can't give this

1:13:59.648 --> 1:14:00.983
to Opal Koboi.
It's too powerful.

1:14:01.066 --> 1:14:02.168
Then what are you waiting for?

1:14:02.192 --> 1:14:03.672
Use its magic
to get your father back.

1:14:03.735 --> 1:14:05.404
- I can't. Not yet.
- I don't understand.

1:14:05.571 --> 1:14:07.447
This holds a power
no human can access.

1:14:07.614 --> 1:14:08.675
It's their source of magic,

1:14:08.699 --> 1:14:10.299
as important to them
as the sun is to us.

1:14:10.409 --> 1:14:11.410
You have to try.

1:14:11.577 --> 1:14:12.817
I thought I could, but I can't.

1:14:12.911 --> 1:14:14.830
Holly said if any human
uses it, they'll die.

1:14:14.997 --> 1:14:16.331
We're running out of time.

1:14:16.498 --> 1:14:18.250
Artemis, it's too dangerous.

1:14:18.417 --> 1:14:20.294
Exactly.
It's useless in my hands.

1:14:20.460 --> 1:14:21.795
But not in mine.

1:14:22.004 --> 1:14:23.172
You're late.

1:14:23.338 --> 1:14:26.300
You know I'm breaking
every rule in the book.

1:14:27.176 --> 1:14:28.594
You like to break rules.

1:14:28.760 --> 1:14:30.053
You can talk.

1:14:31.346 --> 1:14:32.681
Let's make a trade.

1:14:32.848 --> 1:14:34.349
The Aculos for my father.

1:14:36.101 --> 1:14:38.145
How do I know I can trust you?

1:14:38.937 --> 1:14:40.981
My father used to say,

1:14:41.064 --> 1:14:43.400
"A friend's eye
is a good mirror."

1:14:44.443 --> 1:14:45.986
Are we friends,

1:14:46.445 --> 1:14:47.905
Artemis Fowl?

1:14:49.865 --> 1:14:51.241
We are.

1:14:55.370 --> 1:14:56.705
Forever friends.

1:14:59.666 --> 1:15:01.251
We need to hurry.

1:15:11.970 --> 1:15:13.931
Your time is up.

1:15:14.306 --> 1:15:17.267
The young genius Artemis Fowl

1:15:17.434 --> 1:15:20.270
has failed his beloved father.

1:15:21.230 --> 1:15:24.316
Say hello to Beechwood for me.

1:15:30.364 --> 1:15:32.157
I don't even know
that this will work.

1:15:33.492 --> 1:15:35.077
You have to try.

1:15:38.205 --> 1:15:39.581
Carry me always.

1:15:41.124 --> 1:15:43.293
Carry me well.

1:15:43.377 --> 1:15:47.548
I am thy teacher
of herb and spell.

1:15:48.423 --> 1:15:52.135
I am thy link to power arcane.

1:15:53.387 --> 1:15:57.724
Forget me,
and thy magic shall wane.

1:16:09.611 --> 1:16:11.363
Die, Fowl!

1:16:13.907 --> 1:16:15.993
To power arcane.

1:16:16.159 --> 1:16:20.539
Forget me,
and thy magic shall wane.

1:16:20.706 --> 1:16:23.584
Carry me well. Carry me well.

1:16:26.128 --> 1:16:27.921
Forget me, magic shall wane.

1:16:34.553 --> 1:16:35.679
Carry me well.

1:16:57.326 --> 1:16:58.785
Did it work?

1:16:59.244 --> 1:17:00.412
Did you bring him back?

1:17:01.538 --> 1:17:02.706
I don't know.

1:17:13.509 --> 1:17:15.636
He can't be. Please.

1:17:19.932 --> 1:17:21.558
Dad!

1:17:25.604 --> 1:17:27.272
Dad!

1:17:46.250 --> 1:17:47.334
Artemis...

1:17:48.669 --> 1:17:50.671
I'm so sorry.

1:17:51.255 --> 1:17:52.381
It's over.

1:17:53.048 --> 1:17:54.550
I've lost him, haven't I?

1:17:56.426 --> 1:17:57.719
Artemis!

1:17:58.637 --> 1:17:59.805
Did you hear that?

1:18:01.932 --> 1:18:03.767
Dad! Dad!

1:18:06.895 --> 1:18:07.980
Dad!

1:18:09.189 --> 1:18:10.357
Dad!

1:18:13.068 --> 1:18:14.152
Dad!

1:18:15.320 --> 1:18:16.446
Artemis.

1:18:23.829 --> 1:18:25.038
No!

1:18:31.753 --> 1:18:32.838
How?

1:18:33.005 --> 1:18:34.506
How did you save me, son?

1:18:34.673 --> 1:18:36.675
I just followed the story.

1:18:38.051 --> 1:18:39.720
With a little help
from a friend.

1:18:41.096 --> 1:18:42.514
Dad,

1:18:42.681 --> 1:18:44.600
meet Officer Holly Short,

1:18:44.766 --> 1:18:46.894
daughter of Beechwood Short.

1:18:51.481 --> 1:18:55.235
Your father was a great man
and a dear friend.

1:18:57.613 --> 1:18:58.989
He brought me the Aculos

1:18:59.072 --> 1:19:00.991
because there are forces
in your world

1:19:01.575 --> 1:19:03.619
who wanted its power
for themselves.

1:19:04.328 --> 1:19:06.705
So, he was trying to protect it?

1:19:06.872 --> 1:19:07.998
Yes.

1:19:08.165 --> 1:19:10.292
Yes, yes. He was.

1:19:10.459 --> 1:19:12.085
And he did.

1:19:12.252 --> 1:19:13.545
With his life.

1:19:15.130 --> 1:19:16.924
Your father was a hero, Holly.

1:19:18.133 --> 1:19:19.384
Just like you.

1:19:20.802 --> 1:19:23.722
He, gave me this list.

1:19:24.556 --> 1:19:27.184
It's a list of names
that I can't even pronounce.

1:19:27.351 --> 1:19:28.560
These are Opal's accomplices.

1:19:28.644 --> 1:19:30.562
We were looking for them
when I was captured.

1:19:30.729 --> 1:19:32.648
They're the ones
you'll want to investigate.

1:19:34.024 --> 1:19:35.651
I'm sorry for your loss.

1:19:36.109 --> 1:19:37.110
Thank you very much.

1:19:40.531 --> 1:19:42.824
- It's so good to see you.
- I am not going to cry.

1:19:43.033 --> 1:19:44.576
I'm not going to cry.

1:20:26.910 --> 1:20:28.954
The Aculos is safe at last,

1:20:29.037 --> 1:20:30.497
now that we know our enemies,

1:20:30.664 --> 1:20:32.207
thanks to you, Holly.

1:20:38.172 --> 1:20:39.840
Quite the day.

1:20:40.007 --> 1:20:41.383
Yes, Commander.

1:20:45.470 --> 1:20:48.223
Curb that maverick streak in you

1:20:48.849 --> 1:20:51.185
and you'll make
a decent officer someday.

1:20:52.060 --> 1:20:53.395
Thank you, Commander.

1:21:05.699 --> 1:21:08.785
This place needs
fairies like you.

1:21:12.289 --> 1:21:17.503
Our world has never been
so much in danger.

1:21:20.464 --> 1:21:22.341
It's not perfect, Holly.

1:21:23.091 --> 1:21:25.928
But it's ours,
it's a light to guide us,

1:21:26.011 --> 1:21:28.347
and it's worth fighting for.

1:21:29.431 --> 1:21:31.475
I want you to investigate

1:21:31.558 --> 1:21:34.144
every name
on your father's list.

1:21:35.145 --> 1:21:36.188
Me?

1:21:37.648 --> 1:21:39.274
Well, who else am I talking to?

1:21:39.441 --> 1:21:40.943
Nobody else, Commander, just me.

1:21:41.735 --> 1:21:43.862
- Go on.
- I'm going to...

1:21:44.446 --> 1:21:46.323
You won't regret...
I will not...

1:21:46.490 --> 1:21:47.699
- Go on.
- I'll just go.

1:22:09.263 --> 1:22:10.722
Here we go, Dad.

1:22:21.775 --> 1:22:24.361
- Nice work, Holly!
- Well done, Holly!

1:22:32.744 --> 1:22:34.037
All right, team,

1:22:34.204 --> 1:22:35.789
here we go.

1:23:15.412 --> 1:23:17.748
This is a community
still coming to terms

1:23:17.831 --> 1:23:19.791
with these stunning revelations.

1:23:19.958 --> 1:23:21.460
The family has lived
in the house

1:23:21.543 --> 1:23:24.213
for generations
and is well-known locally,

1:23:24.379 --> 1:23:27.549
but there's a sense of real
shock here that Artemis Fowl,

1:23:27.716 --> 1:23:30.385
who neighbors describe
as quiet and...

1:23:31.345 --> 1:23:32.638
It would appear we've garnered

1:23:32.721 --> 1:23:33.931
quite a bit of interest.

1:23:34.014 --> 1:23:35.015
Not ideal.

1:23:35.182 --> 1:23:36.266
The media?

1:23:36.433 --> 1:23:38.435
I have someone
working on that right now.

1:23:38.602 --> 1:23:40.312
I expected you would.

1:23:41.480 --> 1:23:42.898
These are for you, son.

1:23:43.273 --> 1:23:44.399
Just don't forget to wash it

1:23:44.483 --> 1:23:46.026
before you bring it back, okay?

1:23:47.069 --> 1:23:48.362
Where are we going?

1:23:48.529 --> 1:23:49.696
To finish this.

1:23:50.113 --> 1:23:51.406
You think I'm ready?

1:23:51.573 --> 1:23:53.116
I know you're ready.

1:23:54.117 --> 1:23:55.994
First, I have a call to make.

1:24:15.138 --> 1:24:16.515
You failed, Opal.

1:24:16.974 --> 1:24:18.851
You were wrong about my father.

1:24:19.309 --> 1:24:22.437
About Beechwood.
About everything.

1:24:23.063 --> 1:24:24.481
And now...

1:24:25.357 --> 1:24:27.192
we're coming for you.

1:24:27.359 --> 1:24:31.113
You think you can beat me?

1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:33.490
You have no idea the world

1:24:33.574 --> 1:24:36.368
that you have just entered, boy.

1:24:36.535 --> 1:24:39.329
Just who do you think you are?

1:24:39.496 --> 1:24:41.331
I'm Artemis Fowl...

1:24:42.833 --> 1:24:45.460
and I'm a criminal mastermind.

1:25:20.954 --> 1:25:22.331
What an extraordinary ending

1:25:22.414 --> 1:25:24.082
to your remarkable fairy tale.

1:25:24.249 --> 1:25:25.351
But let's get back
to the thief, shall we?

1:25:25.375 --> 1:25:26.561
He will be brought to justice,

1:25:26.585 --> 1:25:28.545
and you will not leave here
until you assist us.

1:25:29.213 --> 1:25:30.964
You really don't believe
any of it?

1:25:31.048 --> 1:25:32.317
The only thing
in that fanciful tale

1:25:32.341 --> 1:25:33.967
I did believe
is that you can be bought.

1:25:34.134 --> 1:25:35.195
So, let us offer you a deal.

1:25:35.219 --> 1:25:36.762
Help us apprehend
Artemis Fowl, Sr.,

1:25:36.929 --> 1:25:38.597
and then you'll walk.

1:25:38.680 --> 1:25:40.057
Tsk.

1:25:40.140 --> 1:25:43.268
Or perhaps I offer you a deal?

1:25:44.186 --> 1:25:46.271
I walk out on my own,

1:25:46.355 --> 1:25:49.483
and you leave
the Fowls alone forever.

1:25:49.816 --> 1:25:52.528
And why would we ever do that?

1:25:52.694 --> 1:25:55.531
So that you can
all sleep at night,

1:25:56.448 --> 1:25:59.868
knowing that the fairy tales
you tell your kids

1:26:00.035 --> 1:26:02.454
remain beautiful dreams,

1:26:02.955 --> 1:26:08.126
and not living nightmares.

1:26:10.128 --> 1:26:12.047
And the next time
you see the Fowls,

1:26:12.130 --> 1:26:15.551
be sure to thank them
for protecting us all.

1:26:15.717 --> 1:26:17.302
They keep the peace.

1:26:17.469 --> 1:26:19.054
Don't ever forget it.

1:26:20.597 --> 1:26:22.724
That's why Artemis
set up my arrest.

1:26:22.808 --> 1:26:24.184
That's why I'm here.

1:26:24.351 --> 1:26:27.229
He figured
you'd have to believe me.

1:26:33.986 --> 1:26:35.779
Alert the guards.

1:26:39.783 --> 1:26:41.869
I hope you don't get squeamish.

1:26:47.583 --> 1:26:48.667
Lockdown!

1:26:48.834 --> 1:26:50.377
Immediate lockdown.

1:26:53.213 --> 1:26:54.882
A tracking device.

1:26:56.258 --> 1:26:57.885
Designed by the kid.

1:26:59.511 --> 1:27:01.972
Clap your hands
if you believe in fairies.

1:27:06.185 --> 1:27:08.187
That's my ride!

1:27:08.896 --> 1:27:10.022
Lockdown!

1:27:10.189 --> 1:27:11.940
Get back here,
you filthy little dwarf!

1:27:12.107 --> 1:27:14.902
Dwarfus Giaganticus!

1:27:22.784 --> 1:27:24.870
Don't mind me, I got this.

1:27:29.750 --> 1:27:31.293
Are you ready
to get back to work?

1:27:31.460 --> 1:27:33.587
I thought you'd never ask.

1:27:34.505 --> 1:27:36.924
We have
some unfinished business.

1:27:37.674 --> 1:27:40.052
I love my job!

1:27:59.988 --> 1:28:01.198
Okay.

1:28:01.865 --> 1:28:03.158
Let's go.
