01:35.260 --> 01:36.852
Hi, Jane.
Hi!

01:48.006 --> 01:51.134
Happy, happy, happy...

01:51.210 --> 01:52.268
Anniversary.

01:54.446 --> 01:56.141
Some things
never change, do they?

01:56.215 --> 01:57.944
I just thought
you might be drifting.

01:58.016 --> 01:59.847
He was pausing.
Exactly.

01:59.952 --> 02:01.817
Okay.
Happy anniversary.

02:01.887 --> 02:03.855
You two have led an
extraordinarily blessed life.

02:03.956 --> 02:05.856
Mmm.
For as long as
I've known you,

02:05.958 --> 02:09.519
you've managed to always
somehow do everything
entirely right.

02:09.627 --> 02:10.959
That's so true.

02:11.029 --> 02:12.894
But honestly,
how could it be
30 years?

02:12.998 --> 02:14.226
When did we do
that trip to Spain?

02:14.299 --> 02:16.028
It was for both
of our what?

02:16.135 --> 02:17.295
Fifteenth anniversaries.

02:17.369 --> 02:18.802
God, that was
a great trip.

02:18.871 --> 02:20.361
Yeah.

02:20.472 --> 02:21.666
Hey, guys.
How's it going?
Hey!

02:21.740 --> 02:24.231
Hey, Ollie.
How was graduation?

02:24.343 --> 02:26.641
It was fantastic.
When's Luke's graduation?

02:26.712 --> 02:27.872
Next week.

02:27.946 --> 02:29.038
It's in three days.

02:29.148 --> 02:30.672
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mean, this week.

02:31.917 --> 02:34.977
Are the girls going?

02:36.488 --> 02:38.080
Yeah, they can't wait.

02:38.190 --> 02:41.023
How long is
Luke home before he
has to go back to work?

02:43.061 --> 02:45.256
Um... Only a week.
Oh!

02:45.364 --> 02:46.353
That's it?

02:46.431 --> 02:47.523
I know. I hate it.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.592
- Hi, I'm back.
- Hey.

02:50.369 --> 02:51.700
Here you go, babe.

02:51.770 --> 02:56.002
Well, congrats again.
Great, great party.

02:57.009 --> 02:58.101
And I'll see
you two in New York.

02:58.177 --> 02:59.235
Absolutely, I'm looking
forward to it.

02:59.344 --> 03:01.539
Yeah. Good. Well...

03:01.613 --> 03:03.410
Hey, Jane,
what are you wearing
to the graduation?

03:03.515 --> 03:06.211
Oh! A suit or a dress.
Probably a suit.

03:06.285 --> 03:08.583
Fancy. Okay. I like that.

03:08.687 --> 03:10.678
Uh,
Janey, we'll see you there.
Where are you staying?

03:10.756 --> 03:12.587
We're at the Park Regent.

03:12.691 --> 03:14.386
You said you were at
the Four Seasons, right?

03:14.459 --> 03:15.483
I don't know.
Where are we?

03:15.561 --> 03:16.858
We're at
the Park Regent, too.

03:16.929 --> 03:21.957
Oh. Good. That's...
That'll be convenient,
actually, for...

03:23.235 --> 03:27.137
Okay. So, well...
See you soon.

03:27.239 --> 03:28.263
Bye, Janey.

03:28.340 --> 03:30.706
I'll walk you out.

03:31.877 --> 03:34.573
I thought it was very sweet
how well you and Jake
were getting along.

03:34.646 --> 03:36.614
Yeah.
Felt like old times.

03:36.715 --> 03:40.708
We do know how
to do this by now.
It's been 10 years.

03:40.786 --> 03:41.980
Really?
Yeah.

03:42.087 --> 03:43.918
That's crazy.
I know.

03:49.628 --> 03:51.892
Bye-bye.

04:08.347 --> 04:11.316
Gabby, stop.
You are never gonna
fit all this in.

04:11.416 --> 04:12.940
You can come back for
the rest of it tomorrow.

04:13.018 --> 04:15.452
I can't come back...

04:15.520 --> 04:17.511
Oh, God.
That is all my clothes.

04:17.589 --> 04:18.647
This is clothes?

04:20.591 --> 04:24.153
Oh, good, your mom's home.
She'll figure this out.

04:25.364 --> 04:29.528
Gabby, you're leaving now?
I thought you weren't
going till the morning.

04:29.635 --> 04:31.830
Yeah, except all
my friends are there

04:31.903 --> 04:33.598
and they want me to
come tonight. So...

04:33.672 --> 04:35.537
But it's gonna be
dark soon, honey.

04:35.641 --> 04:37.666
And you can't even
see out the back window.

04:37.776 --> 04:39.971
It's Saturday night,
people will be
on the road, drinking...

04:40.045 --> 04:43.208
Mom. Mom, she'll be there
in a couple of hours.
She'll be fine.

04:43.315 --> 04:45.044
Okay. I'm just gonna
leave this stuff here

04:45.117 --> 04:46.607
and come back
for it in a few days.

04:46.685 --> 04:48.175
You want me to drive it
down in the morning?

04:48.287 --> 04:49.447
I could be there by lunch.

04:49.521 --> 04:52.684
We could go to that big
Bed, Bath and Beyond,
get kitchen stuff.

04:52.791 --> 04:55.385
Gabby? Gabby,
can you look up
from that thing?

04:55.494 --> 04:56.984
I got it covered, Mom.

04:57.062 --> 04:58.689
Hey, gangster.
You gonna help
me carry these?

04:58.797 --> 04:59.786
You know it. Yeah.

04:59.865 --> 05:01.196
What up?

05:01.433 --> 05:03.162
Oh, no,
don't trouble yourself.
Okay.

05:03.268 --> 05:04.292
Why start now?

05:08.473 --> 05:12.034
Mom,
are you afraid to sleep
in the house alone?

05:12.144 --> 05:13.372
No.
Are you?

05:13.478 --> 05:17.278
No, I'm not! One of you
is always moving out.

05:17.349 --> 05:20.841
<i>I'm just wondering
who I'm gonna watch
The Hills with.</i>

05:20.952 --> 05:22.442
<i>Oh! Mamacita.</i>

05:24.790 --> 05:26.348
I'm gonna miss you.

05:26.458 --> 05:27.789
Mmm-hmm.

05:28.794 --> 05:29.818
Oh, my God!

05:29.895 --> 05:31.328
L. A!

05:32.397 --> 05:34.058
Oh, my God!

05:34.166 --> 05:35.861
Stop!

05:36.468 --> 05:37.628
Really doing this.
Okay. Yes, you are.

05:37.703 --> 05:38.897
Do it.

05:40.238 --> 05:41.830
Oh, Mom.
What?

05:41.907 --> 05:44.501
You don't happen to know
where Dad is, do you?

05:44.576 --> 05:46.373
'Cause I tried calling him
to say goodbye.

05:46.478 --> 05:48.173
He was at Ted and Sally's.

05:48.246 --> 05:50.373
He was? How was that?

05:50.816 --> 05:52.681
You and the two
of them at the same...

05:52.751 --> 05:54.150
I mean, that must've...

05:55.387 --> 05:56.411
How was that?

05:56.488 --> 05:58.251
It was...

05:58.924 --> 06:00.414
Whatever. It was fine.

06:00.525 --> 06:02.152
Was her lunatic child there?

06:02.227 --> 06:04.491
Not this time, no.

06:04.863 --> 06:06.387
Now, listen to me.

06:06.465 --> 06:07.830
Call me as soon
as you get there.

06:09.034 --> 06:11.366
Do not forget. Gabby!

06:11.436 --> 06:13.267
I will! I'll call you.

06:13.338 --> 06:14.703
You knock 'em dead,
little one.

06:14.773 --> 06:16.570
Hey, and call us
when you get there, too.

06:16.675 --> 06:18.836
None of this
on the road. Dangerous.

06:18.910 --> 06:20.343
Right. Thank you.

06:20.412 --> 06:21.606
Okay. Bye!

06:21.680 --> 06:22.942
Bye.

06:23.048 --> 06:24.515
- I love you, guys.
- Bye.

06:31.022 --> 06:34.185
They grow up
so freaking fast,
don't they?

06:34.259 --> 06:36.090
I just hate it.
I hate it.

06:37.863 --> 06:40.388
Mom, maybe you
should get a dog.

06:40.465 --> 06:42.524
Oh, my God.
Goodbye, you two.

06:43.535 --> 06:44.832
Bye. Love you, boss.

06:44.903 --> 06:46.302
Love you.

06:51.309 --> 06:53.869
Bye, Mom!

07:45.263 --> 07:46.287
Here you go.

07:58.009 --> 07:59.033
Reynaldo.

07:59.110 --> 08:01.601
Yeah? Too much sugar.
 Little bit.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.307
I know.
Have you been helped?

08:03.381 --> 08:06.646
Hey, who wants coffee
while you're waiting?

08:07.052 --> 08:08.644
Everything okay?
It's great, thanks.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.018
Good.

08:11.456 --> 08:12.445
Go check on table five,
would you?

08:12.524 --> 08:13.548
Sure.

08:13.658 --> 08:14.955
Thanks.

08:15.827 --> 08:17.385
Hello.
Hi.

08:17.496 --> 08:18.986
Jane!

08:19.064 --> 08:20.088
Peter. Hi!

08:20.165 --> 08:21.154
Hi.

08:21.233 --> 08:22.427
How are you?

08:22.501 --> 08:23.661
Hi!

08:23.735 --> 08:25.635
I can't remember,
have you ever met
Adam Schaeffer?

08:25.704 --> 08:27.035
Yes.
No.

08:27.639 --> 08:29.800
Well, it was...
It was quick. Well...

08:31.576 --> 08:33.043
Look what we've got.

08:33.111 --> 08:34.169
Your plans.

08:34.246 --> 08:36.043
I'm so excited!

08:39.851 --> 08:42.649
I've been thinking
about this addition for...

08:42.721 --> 08:43.710
Ten years.

08:43.788 --> 08:45.255
Ten years? I know.

08:47.259 --> 08:50.251
Mmm-hmm.

08:51.763 --> 08:55.358
Ooh! This is nice.
I like this wall
of windows, Peter.

08:55.433 --> 08:57.560
That was Adam, actually.

08:57.636 --> 08:59.228
Oh!

08:59.337 --> 09:02.932
And I love where
you've put the stairs.
That is so good.

09:03.041 --> 09:05.100
Adam's idea.

09:06.344 --> 09:09.575
I'm finally getting
a real kitchen

09:09.681 --> 09:13.242
with four walls
and place to put
everything I want.

09:15.353 --> 09:18.618
You actually understood
what I wanted.

09:18.723 --> 09:20.247
All Adam.

09:21.526 --> 09:22.788
I'm happy you like it.

09:22.861 --> 09:25.125
I'm so... Hi.

09:25.363 --> 09:26.625
Hello.

09:28.300 --> 09:30.359
So, you read all my e-mails.

09:30.435 --> 09:32.960
All 47 of them, yes.

09:33.305 --> 09:35.432
Jane, it's 10:15.
Yeah?

09:35.540 --> 09:37.030
Oh, it is.

09:37.108 --> 09:40.077
Sorry, I have
an appointment,
a dentist appointment.

09:40.779 --> 09:41.871
Sure.

09:41.947 --> 09:42.936
And, could you
just leave those here

09:43.014 --> 09:45.039
so I could make
a few notes and...

09:45.116 --> 09:48.779
Oh, actually, I do have
one tiny note now.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.980
In my bathroom,
no "his-and-her" sinks.

09:52.991 --> 09:55.221
Oh, okay. Sure. No "his."

09:55.293 --> 09:56.453
Just "hers."

09:56.561 --> 09:59.325
And you don't
think in the future
you might want a "his"?

09:59.431 --> 10:01.956
Oh, God,
we're talking code
about my life now.

10:02.067 --> 10:03.159
No, no,
I didn't mean to be.

10:03.268 --> 10:06.795
The truth is,
in my current bathroom
I have two sinks

10:06.905 --> 10:11.137
and sometimes,
the other sink
makes me feel bad.

10:12.677 --> 10:15.339
One sink. Not a problem.

10:15.447 --> 10:18.746
But we should
schedule another meeting.
Is Tuesday good for you?

10:18.817 --> 10:21.081
Tuesday's great.
8:30 too early?

10:21.152 --> 10:23.017
At the house?
I'll be there.

10:31.630 --> 10:32.961
Hi.
Hi.

10:33.031 --> 10:34.726
Hello, I'm Dr. Moss.

10:34.799 --> 10:36.460
Hi, I'm Jane Adler.

10:36.534 --> 10:38.525
So, what brings
you in today?

10:38.637 --> 10:42.300
Well...
Please don't take
this the wrong way.

10:42.540 --> 10:43.768
But I'm the type of person

10:43.842 --> 10:47.642
who kind of
makes fun of people
who get plastic surgery.

10:47.712 --> 10:49.339
Well, I understand that.

10:49.447 --> 10:51.005
You do? Good.
Mmm-hmm.

10:51.116 --> 10:57.180
Because, you know,
some women can look
a little fake and plasticky.

10:57.288 --> 10:59.813
And, I don't know, just,
in my opinion, worse.

10:59.891 --> 11:00.915
I agree.

11:00.992 --> 11:02.823
Well, good.
Because... Okay.

11:02.894 --> 11:06.625
So, as against
the whole thing
as I... As I am,

11:08.633 --> 11:11.124
I do have a problem
that's really bugging me.

11:11.202 --> 11:14.296
My left eyelid
is really saggy

11:14.372 --> 11:17.068
and sometimes I find
myself holding it up

11:17.142 --> 11:19.007
when I'm watching TV
or reading or...

11:20.311 --> 11:23.405
I was just wondering
if that's something
you could fix.

11:23.515 --> 11:26.006
Look straight ahead. Okay.

11:26.484 --> 11:29.146
Well,
you have the same amount of
excess skin on both sides.

11:29.220 --> 11:31.245
Really? Oh.

11:31.356 --> 11:34.917
Well, I'm only interested
in fixing one eye.

11:35.226 --> 11:37.854
Jane, what you
need to fix this
is a brow-lift.

11:37.929 --> 11:40.921
A brow-lift?
What is that exactly?

11:41.199 --> 11:43.360
Well, we surgically
cut at the hairline.

11:43.435 --> 11:45.232
We make
an incision right here

11:45.336 --> 11:46.496
and then we
pull the skin back

11:46.571 --> 11:47.936
a little tighter
over your skull

11:48.039 --> 11:50.098
and staple it in place
right over your ears.

11:50.208 --> 11:52.039
Now, recovery is
not all that bad.

11:52.110 --> 11:55.079
You could be quite numb,
and you'll probably
have a headache

11:55.180 --> 11:58.206
that lasts
anywhere from, say,
three to six months.

11:58.283 --> 12:00.183
Three to six months!
Oh. Awesome.

12:14.766 --> 12:16.927
Yes, it did.
I am under a lot
of pressure.

12:17.035 --> 12:18.366
I don't know if
you're aware of that.

12:18.436 --> 12:19.698
No, no. I think
that is something

12:19.771 --> 12:21.363
that you should
fully be aware of.

12:21.439 --> 12:24.374
Okay. Okay.
But that's not
what you said.

12:24.442 --> 12:25.568
Jane!

12:25.677 --> 12:27.338
Hey.
 Oh! Hi.

12:27.412 --> 12:28.970
Hello.
Hi.

12:29.848 --> 12:31.179
Jake. Jake.

12:31.249 --> 12:35.242
Jake. Jake. Jake. Jake.
Jake. Jake? Hello, Jake?

12:35.353 --> 12:37.253
Uh, hold on, Pedro.
I'm talking with somebody.

12:37.355 --> 12:40.017
Pedro, up! Now!

12:41.626 --> 12:43.184
So, what are you
doing in this building?

12:43.261 --> 12:44.660
Dentist.

12:44.729 --> 12:45.957
You don't go to
Sharon anymore?

12:46.064 --> 12:47.964
No. Changed.

12:48.867 --> 12:50.232
Oh.

13:07.986 --> 13:09.044
Yeah...

13:09.120 --> 13:10.712
Okay, buddy.
Here we go.
Jake.

13:10.789 --> 13:13.417
Okay, Pedro, honey,
don't do that. Pedro.

13:14.125 --> 13:15.592
See you in the Big Apple.
I'll see you there.

13:21.166 --> 13:23.396
That is beyond!

13:23.501 --> 13:26.732
When the three of them
got in the elevator...

13:26.838 --> 13:29.636
Between that
and the staples

13:29.707 --> 13:32.232
and the headache
for six months...

13:32.343 --> 13:34.072
That was the most
insane hour of my life.

13:35.480 --> 13:36.504
Jake has lost his mind.

13:36.581 --> 13:37.843
Yeah, I don't know.

13:37.916 --> 13:40.749
Oh, I know.
He's a complete prick
for cheating on you.

13:40.852 --> 13:42.911
I can't disagree
with you on that.

13:43.087 --> 13:46.147
And then he marries her.
A known lunatic.

13:46.224 --> 13:47.589
Well, she has a big job.

13:49.060 --> 13:50.254
Why do you always say that?

13:50.361 --> 13:53.524
Because she does.
She runs the whole
marketing department at KY

13:53.598 --> 13:56.567
or whatever that
station's called.

13:58.069 --> 14:00.560
She can't be that
big of a lunatic.

14:00.672 --> 14:01.764
Janey, come on.

14:01.873 --> 14:04.671
He cheats on you with her,
your 20 year marriage ends.

14:04.742 --> 14:06.733
Then six months later,
she leaves Jake

14:06.811 --> 14:08.369
and runs off with
some random guy,

14:08.446 --> 14:11.210
has a baby, then leaves
that guy for Jake.

14:11.282 --> 14:12.510
And she's not nuts?

14:12.584 --> 14:15.553
Oh, Jo, you are so
lucky Jerry is dead.

14:15.620 --> 14:17.110
Thank you.

14:17.222 --> 14:19.588
No, I mean, you don't
have to bump into him.

14:19.691 --> 14:21.022
Well, that's true.
Yeah.

14:22.694 --> 14:24.855
Oh, Janey,
do you wanna meet a guy

14:24.929 --> 14:27.056
I met on Match. Com
that I didn't like?

14:27.131 --> 14:29.361
Oh, wow,
what a great offer.

14:29.434 --> 14:31.197
No, thanks.
I don't think so.

14:31.269 --> 14:33.294
Well, he wasn't that awful.

14:33.404 --> 14:35.429
Sounding better
every minute.

14:36.074 --> 14:40.534
You know, it's not
healthy to not have sex
for however long it's been.

14:41.746 --> 14:45.273
Trust me, I am not
not doing it on purpose.

14:45.383 --> 14:47.146
Oh.

14:47.252 --> 14:48.981
Okay, I don't know
if this is true...

14:49.053 --> 14:50.111
Mmm-hmm.

14:50.221 --> 14:51.415
...but I read online
about a woman

14:51.489 --> 14:53.320
that hadn't
done it in so long

14:53.424 --> 14:56.222
that her vagina closed up.

14:58.329 --> 15:02.265
What?
Get out of here! Come on.

15:02.333 --> 15:04.927
I swear to God,
it grew back together.

15:07.238 --> 15:09.934
Wait, was it
ever one piece?

15:10.074 --> 15:11.735
What? Ooh, no.

15:11.809 --> 15:13.572
No, she had to have
a vaginoplasty.

15:13.645 --> 15:14.669
Ouch!

15:14.746 --> 15:16.008
Oh, God!

15:17.749 --> 15:21.947
"Hello, Dr. Moss,
I have a little situation
that needs fixing."

15:22.020 --> 15:24.955
Bubbee. Bubbee,
if you wanna have
your situation fixed,

15:25.023 --> 15:26.957
you have to date someone.

15:27.025 --> 15:28.356
Seriously.

15:30.628 --> 15:31.822
Anyone.

15:52.784 --> 15:54.217
Oh, there he is!

15:55.453 --> 15:58.513
There he is!

15:58.623 --> 16:00.113
Oh, hello.

16:01.492 --> 16:03.392
Good to see you!
We missed you.
Hi!

16:03.628 --> 16:06.153
Who is this guy?
Hey, hey.
How are you?

16:06.230 --> 16:09.427
Oh, I love it
when we're all in
the same time zone!

16:11.135 --> 16:13.296
So, what's up, Luke?
Did you decide to
have that party?

16:13.371 --> 16:14.565
Oh, yeah, big time.

16:14.672 --> 16:15.900
What party?

16:16.007 --> 16:17.167
Are you guys
going to sleep over?

16:17.241 --> 16:18.799
Yeah, if you
give us your bed and
change the sheets.

16:18.876 --> 16:20.036
You're having
a party? When?

16:20.144 --> 16:21.873
Hi. Adler, two rooms.

16:21.980 --> 16:23.140
Hopefully next
to each other.

16:23.214 --> 16:27.048
I have an Adler, J.
In a Superior Suite.
Park Avenue view?

16:27.251 --> 16:30.880
Oh, I'm sorry,
here it is. Adler, J.,
two standard doubles.

16:30.989 --> 16:32.251
Sorry about that.
Right.

16:32.357 --> 16:35.485
We are not the ones
in the Superior Suite.

16:35.560 --> 16:36.618
Mmm.

16:36.694 --> 16:40.186
Have the other Adlers
checked in yet?
Just wondering.

16:40.264 --> 16:42.027
No, they haven't, ma'am.
Not yet.

16:42.100 --> 16:44.694
Now,
I just need a credit card
and your signature.

16:45.336 --> 16:47.361
Can the girls
come with me now
and help me set up?

16:47.438 --> 16:49.702
Oh, and by girls,
he means the three of us.

16:49.774 --> 16:51.867
Wait, hold on.
Set up for what?

16:51.943 --> 16:55.242
I have reservations
for us for dinner.
That's not happening now?

16:55.346 --> 16:56.836
I don't know.

16:56.914 --> 16:59.246
Me and my friends
are having this huge thing
at our apartment

16:59.350 --> 17:01.580
and the girls said
they'd help us set up.

17:03.187 --> 17:05.280
We're gonna be together
all day tomorrow.

17:05.390 --> 17:08.051
Mom, it's his last night
before graduation.

17:08.126 --> 17:09.525
Okay, okay.

17:10.127 --> 17:13.564
Can I do anything
to help, or you know...

17:15.366 --> 17:17.630
Love your credit card.

17:17.734 --> 17:19.099
Oh.

17:20.805 --> 17:23.035
Here it goes.
Once again.

17:53.838 --> 17:55.738
Hi!
Hi.

17:55.807 --> 17:59.072
Adler, for one, Room 2112.

17:59.143 --> 18:00.940
Your table is
almost ready,
Mrs. Adler.

18:01.012 --> 18:02.912
Would you like to
wait in the bar?
Sure.

18:08.986 --> 18:09.975
Hi.

18:10.054 --> 18:11.112
Hi.

18:12.824 --> 18:14.223
I'll have a Pinot Noir.

18:14.292 --> 18:15.759
Right away.

18:15.827 --> 18:18.455
No, you know,
I'll have a very dry
Tanqueray Martini,

18:18.529 --> 18:19.587
straight up with a twist.

18:19.664 --> 18:20.824
Mmm-hmm.

18:32.810 --> 18:34.141
Hey.

18:38.382 --> 18:39.542
Where's your...

18:39.617 --> 18:41.608
Uh, Pedro got
the stomach flu.

18:41.686 --> 18:43.176
So, I'm flying solo.

18:43.287 --> 18:47.223
Really?
Didn't know you knew
how to be by yourself.

18:47.325 --> 18:49.987
Any chance you
could go easy on me?

18:50.194 --> 18:51.889
Just a one-night free pass.

18:53.397 --> 18:54.728
You look good, Janey.

18:54.799 --> 18:56.027
Yeah.

18:56.567 --> 18:58.467
You do. You always do.

18:58.536 --> 19:00.333
Your hair's shorter.
Longer.

19:00.404 --> 19:01.632
I like it.

19:02.507 --> 19:04.099
Mrs. Adler?
Your table is ready.

19:04.175 --> 19:05.233
Yes? Thank you.

19:05.309 --> 19:08.506
Do you want
some company, Mrs. Adler?

19:08.579 --> 19:10.570
Could we eat at the bar?
Absolutely.

19:10.681 --> 19:12.546
All right.
We both have to eat.

19:12.617 --> 19:14.084
Mmm.

19:14.185 --> 19:17.052
When was the last time
we had a meal together?

19:17.155 --> 19:19.555
You and me? Alone? 1999.

19:19.657 --> 19:22.990
So, come on.
Once every 10 years.

19:31.335 --> 19:34.270
So, how are things in
the fertility world?

19:34.372 --> 19:36.533
I can't believe it
took you this long
to bring that up.

19:36.607 --> 19:37.733
Sperm issues?

19:37.842 --> 19:39.332
Apparently, yes.

19:39.410 --> 19:41.435
A baby?

19:41.546 --> 19:43.411
Really, Jake?

19:44.448 --> 19:48.544
So, the next time
you go to a graduation,
you'll be, what, 58 plus...

19:48.619 --> 19:51.850
I believe the number
you're looking for is 79.

19:52.290 --> 19:54.520
Okay. Yeah.

19:54.592 --> 19:56.924
Seriously,
how is that good?

19:57.461 --> 19:59.224
Why are we
talking about this?

19:59.297 --> 20:01.231
I thought we were
going to have some fun.

20:01.299 --> 20:02.857
Where did you
get that idea?

20:04.268 --> 20:06.964
Why do you
want to know this?
You're obsessed.

20:07.071 --> 20:09.539
Just tell me, how long
were you seeing him for?

20:09.607 --> 20:12.075
Oh, please,
it was five years ago.

20:12.143 --> 20:14.043
I know, but I
always wondered. So?
Mmm-hmm.

20:15.112 --> 20:16.409
Little jealous?

20:16.480 --> 20:17.970
Yes.

20:18.149 --> 20:19.878
Oh, the man is married now.

20:19.951 --> 20:22.476
I don't care. How long?

20:22.987 --> 20:25.285
Eight months.

20:25.356 --> 20:26.414
Long.

20:26.490 --> 20:28.321
Not long.

20:30.561 --> 20:31.585
No!

20:47.311 --> 20:50.644
This song reminds me
of your birthday party.
The one in our old house.

20:50.748 --> 20:54.650
Oh! Oh, that was
such a fun night.

20:54.752 --> 20:57.016
So fun. You wore
that halter dress.

20:57.121 --> 20:58.645
Yeah.

21:00.691 --> 21:01.715
Oh, man.

21:01.792 --> 21:03.089
You wanna dance?

21:04.629 --> 21:05.926
No.

21:32.657 --> 21:35.490
You're married
to someone else!

21:35.559 --> 21:37.527
Tell me about it.

21:58.649 --> 21:59.911
Home sweet home.

21:59.984 --> 22:02.145
Oh! Oh, God!

22:04.155 --> 22:06.350
That was one crazy ride.

22:06.424 --> 22:08.858
I thought we were
going to break the bed.

22:10.161 --> 22:12.527
I'm having
an out-of-body experience.

22:12.596 --> 22:13.995
Totally.

22:14.065 --> 22:17.501
You're so great, Janey.
I forgot how great.
Holy shit.

22:17.568 --> 22:21.060
Please just shut up.

22:21.172 --> 22:23.402
I'm so dizzy.

22:23.507 --> 22:25.600
And the Pilates are
paying off, by the way.

22:28.546 --> 22:30.605
Oh, no! Are you okay?

22:30.715 --> 22:31.943
Look the other way, Jake.

22:32.049 --> 22:33.038
Why?

22:33.117 --> 22:34.175
Because I have to get up.

22:34.251 --> 22:35.309
Well, Jane,
I've seen your...

22:35.386 --> 22:36.785
Look the other way, Jake!

22:45.629 --> 22:46.618
Are you okay?

22:46.697 --> 22:47.755
What is wrong with us?

22:47.865 --> 22:52.529
What do you mean?
This was amazing.
We just had a great time.

22:52.603 --> 22:54.730
Oh,
a great time.

22:54.805 --> 22:58.605
This is the dumbest thing
two people have ever done!

22:58.709 --> 23:02.270
Oh, really? I don't know.
I haven't thought it through,

23:02.380 --> 23:06.077
but off the top
of my head I thought
it was smoking hot,

23:06.150 --> 23:09.142
so something about
it wasn't so dumb.

23:09.253 --> 23:13.155
And FYI,
I like that you stopped
getting bikini waxes.

23:13.257 --> 23:15.088
You've gone native.

23:15.159 --> 23:16.456
I was into it.

23:29.106 --> 23:30.505
I love you.

23:37.415 --> 23:38.848
Do you see him?
No.

23:41.218 --> 23:42.913
There he is!

23:47.091 --> 23:48.490
Hey!

23:50.361 --> 23:51.589
Oh!

24:02.640 --> 24:03.971
Look at Dad.

24:11.515 --> 24:13.210
Lukey!

24:22.326 --> 24:24.453
All I hear is,
"Luke David Adler."
I got to go up.

24:24.528 --> 24:25.961
I got to jump
over these people.

24:26.997 --> 24:28.589
From our seats
it looked like you were

24:28.666 --> 24:30.531
crowd-surfing at
a Metallica show.

24:30.634 --> 24:31.658
Come on.

24:33.637 --> 24:34.695
You okay?

24:34.772 --> 24:36.171
Yeah. Totally.

24:43.581 --> 24:48.041
I would like to
propose a toast
to your mother.

24:48.152 --> 24:50.484
To me? What?

24:50.554 --> 24:54.422
Now, I've done my part
with you guys,
but, Jane, you...

24:55.659 --> 24:56.853
Very talented you.

24:56.927 --> 24:58.087
Oh, God!

24:58.195 --> 24:59.492
Gabby, I'm serious.

24:59.563 --> 25:02.498
Jane, you've done
a magnificent job,

25:03.033 --> 25:04.557
as you always do.

25:04.668 --> 25:09.071
When I look at you
three beautiful kids
all grown up,

25:09.173 --> 25:11.903
I think of all the work
your mother did...

25:13.577 --> 25:15.067
Much of it without my help.

25:15.179 --> 25:17.147
Dude, pull it together.

25:17.214 --> 25:18.306
Yeah.

25:19.383 --> 25:22.079
Janey, I take
my hat off to you.

25:22.186 --> 25:24.711
Okay, Jake. Thank you.

25:24.822 --> 25:28.553
Out of nowhere,
sudden appreciation.
But, thank you, really.

25:28.659 --> 25:32.095
Not totally out
of nowhere, Jane.
If you know what I mean.

25:32.863 --> 25:35.661
Which I don't.
But...

25:35.733 --> 25:36.791
What's he...

25:36.867 --> 25:38.391
I have no idea.
It's just...

25:38.769 --> 25:40.430
Can we just move on?

25:40.538 --> 25:43.735
Okay, I would like
to say something, too.
For real.

25:44.742 --> 25:47.609
No offense to
the lovely Agness or her
charming offspring...

25:49.246 --> 25:50.304
Not nice.

25:50.381 --> 25:51.405
Not nice.

25:51.916 --> 25:53.247
I know, I'm sorry.

25:53.350 --> 25:57.286
But I just wanted to say,
I really loved today.

25:59.290 --> 26:01.520
Just being with
the original five.

26:01.592 --> 26:04.117
Plus Harley,
but he's like one of us.

26:04.361 --> 26:07.330
I don't think we've
ever done this before...

26:07.464 --> 26:10.297
Had a meal together
and hung out like this.

26:10.401 --> 26:12.460
You mean other than
the first 13 years
of your life.

26:12.570 --> 26:14.037
Oh, I know
what she's saying.

26:14.104 --> 26:20.441
It's been awesome
just for a whole
day to be just us.

26:38.295 --> 26:41.958
Something feels right
in the universe again,
doesn't it?

26:44.835 --> 26:47.929
So, who's coming home, when?
No one's told me the details.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.504
Hey. So how's Pedro feeling?

26:53.844 --> 26:54.902
Okay, we're gonna
pack Luke up.

26:54.979 --> 26:56.344
Three of us leave
day after tomorrow

26:56.447 --> 26:58.176
and Luke's coming home
end of the week.

26:58.282 --> 27:00.443
Uh, I will.
Great.

27:00.517 --> 27:03.486
I'll call you
when I land. Bye.

27:03.587 --> 27:05.612
Hey, Janey,
what flight are you on?

27:05.689 --> 27:07.452
I'm on the 4:00.

27:07.524 --> 27:09.253
Oh! Too bad,
I'm on the 5:00.

27:09.326 --> 27:11.851
That's nuts!
Why don't you try to get
on the same flight?

27:11.962 --> 27:13.953
Yeah, I could try.

27:14.264 --> 27:16.255
It's been great,
but let's not push it.

27:16.333 --> 27:17.766
Mom, he's just
trying to be nice.

27:17.835 --> 27:21.271
I know. I know. I know.
Okay, I gotta take off, kids.

27:21.338 --> 27:22.396
So, thank you for staying.

27:22.473 --> 27:23.462
Absolutely, yeah.

27:23.540 --> 27:26.338
You be good.
I'm so proud of you.

27:26.443 --> 27:27.603
Thanks, Mom.

27:27.678 --> 27:29.145
You can
call me if you need me.

27:29.213 --> 27:31.681
Mmm-hmm.

27:35.052 --> 27:37.247
It was really fun.

27:38.455 --> 27:40.389
<i>Just follow a few basic rules</i>

27:40.457 --> 27:42.482
<i>to make your divorce
a less hurtful one,</i>

27:42.559 --> 27:45.050
<i>by breaking
the cycle of conflict.</i>

27:45.162 --> 27:47.562
<i>Accept your ex
for who she is.</i>

27:48.065 --> 27:49.726
A very big ho!

27:49.833 --> 27:51.164
<i>And try to remember</i>

27:51.235 --> 27:52.532
<i>when you first
fell in love...</i>

27:52.636 --> 27:55.230
There she is.
And there she goes.

27:57.641 --> 27:58.972
Jane!

28:01.078 --> 28:02.136
It's Adam.

28:02.479 --> 28:05.607
Oh! It's 8:30,
Tuesday morning!

28:05.683 --> 28:06.707
Are we still okay?

28:06.784 --> 28:08.843
Yes! Yes!
I totally forgot.

28:08.952 --> 28:11.944
Really sorry.
Can you give me a lift
back up to the house?

28:12.022 --> 28:13.853
Sure. Come on in.

28:13.924 --> 28:14.982
Thanks.

28:15.793 --> 28:17.727
<i>But perhaps the most
important lesson</i>

28:17.828 --> 28:20.797
<i>in going
through your divorce
is to learn to forgive.</i>

28:20.864 --> 28:22.297
<i>Forgiveness is the key to...</i>

28:22.366 --> 28:23.697
Oh! Oh! Sorry.

28:23.767 --> 28:25.462
<i>Forgiveness is...</i>

28:29.306 --> 28:32.207
<i>In spite of
your hurt feelings,
prove to her that you are...</i>

28:33.811 --> 28:35.836
Well...

28:37.881 --> 28:39.712
Just getting a divorce?

28:39.817 --> 28:42.047
Yeah.
Two-and-a-half years ago.

28:42.119 --> 28:43.177
Whoa!

28:43.253 --> 28:46.245
It's, uh,
been a process.

28:47.691 --> 28:49.215
Here's the good news.

28:49.326 --> 28:53.262
In two more years,
you'll actually begin
to feel normal again.

28:53.363 --> 28:56.696
In two more years
I'll begin to feel normal?

28:56.767 --> 29:00.203
Why am I having trouble
seeing that as good news?

29:00.871 --> 29:03.339
Maybe that was
just my experience.

29:03.407 --> 29:05.432
Oh, God, I hope so.

29:13.617 --> 29:16.586
Oh, I have an idea.
Let's see if this works.

29:16.687 --> 29:18.279
So, if we move
this wall back a bit,

29:18.355 --> 29:19.879
uh, we can bring
this arch forward,

29:19.957 --> 29:21.117
which is really where
you want it, right?

29:21.225 --> 29:23.090
Yeah,
I would love that.
I thought so.

29:24.795 --> 29:28.287
I have an idea.
What if we move
my bedroom wall

29:28.398 --> 29:33.301
like 6 or 8 feet that way,
just so I can get more
of the morning light?

29:33.971 --> 29:35.233
Not possible?

29:35.305 --> 29:37.569
Yes.
But you'd wake up
in the morning,

29:37.641 --> 29:40.303
walk out your bedroom door
and fall 12 feet
into the kitchen.

29:40.410 --> 29:43.709
I forgot it
was all open up there.

29:43.781 --> 29:44.770
But I see where
you're headed,

29:44.848 --> 29:45.906
so let me see
what I can do.

29:45.983 --> 29:48.349
By the way,
this property
is so great.

29:48.418 --> 29:49.578
Have you lived here
a long time?

29:49.653 --> 29:51.712
About 10 years. I tried...

29:53.257 --> 29:57.591
Oh! I bought the place
right after my divorce
and, um...

29:57.661 --> 30:00.152
It's taken me

30:00.230 --> 30:03.290
until now to be able
to finally do this.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.561
Good morning.

30:05.636 --> 30:06.728
Uh... Hi.

30:06.804 --> 30:08.032
Am I interrupting?

30:08.105 --> 30:10.096
Adam, this is
my ex-husband...

30:10.174 --> 30:11.607
Oh!
...Jake.

30:11.675 --> 30:13.472
Adam Schaeffer,
my architect.

30:13.577 --> 30:14.805
Hi.
Good to meet you.

30:14.912 --> 30:16.277
Uh, can I take a look?
Do you mind?

30:16.346 --> 30:20.009
Well,
everything's not
100% worked out yet.

30:20.117 --> 30:23.951
Wow! You're finally
getting that kitchen
you always wanted.

30:24.021 --> 30:25.648
Yeah.

30:25.756 --> 30:27.849
Hmm. Huge bedroom.

30:28.792 --> 30:31.192
No,
it's not huge. It's...

30:32.196 --> 30:36.758
Why don't I show these
to you a little later
when we're closer to...

30:36.834 --> 30:39.860
Uh... I... I think
our next step is to
stake out the addition

30:39.970 --> 30:41.232
and see how it
feels size-wise.

30:41.305 --> 30:42.533
Yeah, that would be great.

30:42.639 --> 30:44.834
So, I will e-mail you
and we'll set something up.

30:44.942 --> 30:46.204
Sounds great.

30:46.310 --> 30:48.005
Jake, nice meeting you.

30:48.078 --> 30:49.705
Yeah, you, too.

30:51.281 --> 30:53.010
Got time for
a cup of coffee?

30:53.083 --> 30:54.277
Sure.

31:01.558 --> 31:04.118
Why haven't you returned
any of my calls or e-mails?

31:04.194 --> 31:08.790
Jake, come on!
This is just too weird.

31:09.700 --> 31:14.865
We have to just never do
what we did ever again.

31:16.073 --> 31:18.405
You are
an adulterer and I am

31:18.508 --> 31:20.408
an awful person, basically.

31:20.510 --> 31:23.138
I haven't slept in days.

31:23.213 --> 31:27.047
What we did was so wrong
on so many levels.

31:27.150 --> 31:29.846
And it was so right
on a couple of levels, too.

31:29.920 --> 31:31.046
Admit it.

31:31.121 --> 31:32.213
No, it wasn't.

31:32.322 --> 31:34.051
On no levels was it right.

31:34.157 --> 31:36.921
You can't say
we didn't enjoy
each other's company.

31:37.027 --> 31:39.257
Sitting at the bar, dancing.

31:39.830 --> 31:41.525
After dancing. Come on.

31:41.598 --> 31:43.725
You and I haven't
had fun like that
in 100 years.

31:43.834 --> 31:47.736
Yes,
because we're not supposed
to have fun like that.

31:47.838 --> 31:49.829
We are divorced.

31:51.742 --> 31:56.202
Are you, like,
what, unhappy at home?
Does she not understand you?

31:56.280 --> 31:59.579
Or did you just want
to know what it would be
like with someone my age?

31:59.683 --> 32:01.048
What is this?

32:01.118 --> 32:03.552
I'd be lying
if I said I never
think about you, Janey.

32:03.620 --> 32:06.612
I think about you a lot.

32:06.723 --> 32:11.023
And, no, it's not
perfect at home, obviously.
Look at me.

32:11.094 --> 32:13.892
I've got three grown kids
and I'm going to
kindergarten interviews.

32:13.964 --> 32:15.454
I'm a walking clichÃ©.

32:15.565 --> 32:19.092
And I can't, literally,
can't stop thinking

32:19.169 --> 32:21.399
about what happened
in New York.

32:21.471 --> 32:25.635
Fate brought us
together once,
maybe it happened again.

32:25.742 --> 32:29.473
And I know you've moved on
with your life, I get it.

32:29.579 --> 32:33.709
But you can't deny that
something real and honest
happened that night.

32:33.784 --> 32:36.378
Can't we just go with it?
See where it takes us?

32:36.453 --> 32:38.250
No one has to know.

32:38.322 --> 32:39.346
Wow.

32:39.423 --> 32:42.256
You were so great,
so loose and sexy.

32:42.326 --> 32:45.295
How often do you get
to be like that?

32:45.395 --> 32:47.488
You can run and
open restaurants

32:47.564 --> 32:50.226
and build your
perfect kitchen.

32:50.300 --> 32:55.431
But what about
having someone to hold you
in the middle of the night?

32:55.505 --> 32:57.996
Not high on
my list these days.

32:58.108 --> 33:00.804
What if that
someone is someone
who's known you

33:00.911 --> 33:02.742
since you were 23?

33:03.914 --> 33:05.404
And loved you

33:06.450 --> 33:08.145
for most of your life.

33:08.418 --> 33:10.318
Oh, man!

33:12.422 --> 33:15.289
I forgot what
a good lawyer you are.

33:15.359 --> 33:17.657
Give this a shot, Janey.

33:18.195 --> 33:20.595
Life is short
and it's tough.

33:20.664 --> 33:22.962
Don't discount what
we have together.

33:23.033 --> 33:24.660
You know what they say,

33:24.768 --> 33:27.862
"People who live
in nursing homes that
have plants live longer

33:28.705 --> 33:30.764
"than the people
without plants."

33:30.841 --> 33:34.333
So you're saying
this is a healthy
choice for me?

33:34.444 --> 33:37.436
Honey, I know it is.

33:50.427 --> 33:54.193
Oh, God! Oh, God!
It's official.

33:54.297 --> 33:56.993
We're
having an affair.

33:57.634 --> 33:59.932
Why do you need
to label everything?

34:00.003 --> 34:03.439
Because that's what this is.

34:03.507 --> 34:07.534
Yes,
in its crassest form maybe,
if we were two other people.

34:08.678 --> 34:10.668
Just because we were
married for 19 years

34:10.746 --> 34:13.147
does not not
make this an affair.

34:13.216 --> 34:18.677
Okay, but since we
were together for so long,
it's not really that wrong.

34:18.789 --> 34:22.054
Really? You want to run
that logic by your wife?

34:29.800 --> 34:31.563
Okay, will you
do me a favor?

34:31.668 --> 34:32.760
You're on my side.
Can we switch?

34:32.835 --> 34:36.033
I'm feeling a little,
uh, disoriented.

34:36.139 --> 34:38.039
Since when is
this your side?
Since 10 years ago.

34:38.141 --> 34:39.972
Come on, just... Please?

34:42.913 --> 34:44.402
Can I interest
you in a little...

34:44.514 --> 34:46.344
No.

34:51.554 --> 34:56.424
Why do you think
the sex is so much
sexier this time?

34:57.427 --> 34:59.054
I don't know.

35:04.067 --> 35:06.558
I got to go to work.

35:07.003 --> 35:10.063
Okay. Me, too.

35:18.748 --> 35:21.273
You see what happens
when you're not
looking out for me.

35:21.384 --> 35:24.876
She lets me eat everything.
Pasta, cream cheese.

35:26.189 --> 35:28.919
Would you hand me
my robe, please?

35:30.760 --> 35:33.285
And, um, turn around.

35:33.396 --> 35:35.956
Why do
I have to, uh,
turn around?

35:36.066 --> 35:37.397
Because the last
time you saw me

35:37.467 --> 35:40.402
standing up naked
I was in my 40s.

35:41.905 --> 35:44.874
Things look different
lying down. Just...

35:44.941 --> 35:47.034
You've
gotten kind of nuts.

35:47.110 --> 35:49.374
Yeah.
You know what, Jake,

35:49.446 --> 35:51.243
I think it would be
really good for us

35:51.314 --> 35:54.909
to just not talk
for a couple of days.

35:54.985 --> 35:58.079
You know what I think,
just for the record?

35:58.822 --> 36:01.256
I think we're
doing something
kind of brilliant.

36:01.324 --> 36:04.054
All the things
that tore us apart
aren't issues anymore.

36:04.127 --> 36:08.154
I'd say our problems
actually went away.

36:08.265 --> 36:09.323
What?

36:09.432 --> 36:11.730
Didn't you always say
you felt you weren't
being heard?

36:11.801 --> 36:13.564
Wasn't that our big issue?

36:13.637 --> 36:16.970
Both of us always
feeling rejected
and unappreciated.

36:17.073 --> 36:20.133
Look at us now.
You're so much
more together.

36:20.944 --> 36:22.343
You're not exhausted
all the time.

36:22.445 --> 36:23.605
You're not catering
every weekend

36:23.680 --> 36:25.375
or busy all day
with the kids.

36:25.448 --> 36:28.679
And I'm calmer.
Not as obsessed with work.

36:29.419 --> 36:31.478
I'm a partner. I'm there.

36:31.588 --> 36:35.080
We both grew into the people
we wanted each other to be.

36:35.158 --> 36:36.420
Really?

36:37.494 --> 36:41.362
Well, you're better
than I am at remembering
all the details of our...

36:41.464 --> 36:43.796
Do you remember never
having time for sex?

36:43.867 --> 36:45.334
Now look at us.

36:45.435 --> 36:48.370
We've already done
it two times this week
and it's only Tuesday.

36:48.471 --> 36:50.996
I swear to God,
if half the people
who got divorced

36:51.107 --> 36:52.938
got back together
after 10 years,

36:53.009 --> 36:55.170
their problems
would be solved.

36:55.278 --> 36:56.506
I think we're
on to something.

36:56.613 --> 36:59.207
Not sure
I agree with that.

36:59.282 --> 37:01.250
And, also, we are
not back together.

37:01.318 --> 37:04.481
And I know other
divorced people
think about this.

37:04.554 --> 37:06.545
They wonder, "What if?"

37:07.324 --> 37:11.385
You know,
I think this is
very French of us.

37:11.494 --> 37:14.861
How is
it French of us?

37:14.965 --> 37:19.868
I have a young wife
but I am having sex
with my old wife.

37:21.171 --> 37:25.471
Not old. You know, "ex."
I didn't mean "old."

37:27.143 --> 37:28.303
You're doing that
thing when you act

37:28.378 --> 37:29.504
like you're not
listening to me,

37:29.579 --> 37:32.480
but think about
what I said, okay?

37:32.549 --> 37:33.880
You got any of
your homemade
granola here?

37:33.984 --> 37:35.679
It's been so long
since I had any.

37:35.752 --> 37:36.844
Oh, you miss it?

37:36.920 --> 37:37.978
So much.

37:38.054 --> 37:40.522
We sell it for 6.50
a bag at the store.

37:40.590 --> 37:44.583
Yeah,
well, why give it away
when you can...

37:44.694 --> 37:46.127
God!

37:46.196 --> 37:47.458
Ooh. Kiss goodbye?

37:47.530 --> 37:48.724
Mmm.

37:48.832 --> 37:52.825
Ooh!
She wants to be courted.

37:53.536 --> 37:56.562
I can do that.
Oh, honey,
thanks for the coffee.

37:56.673 --> 37:58.038
Oh, God!

38:03.680 --> 38:05.614
Oh, my God! Now what?

38:05.715 --> 38:08.240
Three pies?
Oh, this is a feast!

38:08.351 --> 38:12.082
I don't know what's
got into me lately,
but I have so much energy...

38:13.423 --> 38:15.891
...which is probably
the result of all the sex
I've been having.

38:19.429 --> 38:21.556
I'm actually not kidding.

38:23.266 --> 38:25.200
I'm having an affair.

38:27.504 --> 38:28.937
With a married man.

38:29.039 --> 38:30.438
What?

38:31.341 --> 38:32.330
When did
this happen?

38:32.409 --> 38:33.933
Where did you meet him?

38:34.044 --> 38:37.536
"Where did I..."
Well, it started in New York.

38:37.614 --> 38:38.638
New York, last week?

38:38.715 --> 38:39.704
Mmm-hmm.

38:39.783 --> 38:43.048
We did it once there
and once here.

38:43.620 --> 38:46.180
Or maybe, maybe more
than once there.

38:46.256 --> 38:48.281
I don't know.
I was drunk, so I'm...

38:48.358 --> 38:50.588
You had drunken sex
with a married man
in New York

38:50.694 --> 38:52.753
when you went back
for Luke's graduation?

38:52.862 --> 38:56.354
Yeah. Turns out,
I'm a bit of a slut.

38:56.433 --> 38:58.401
Apple, blueberry or plum?

38:58.468 --> 39:00.800
Wait, wait,
wait, wait. Hold on.

39:00.904 --> 39:03.099
You're not saying...

39:04.774 --> 39:05.763
What?

39:05.842 --> 39:06.900
No! You're not!

39:06.976 --> 39:09.206
Oh, yes, I am.

39:10.046 --> 39:13.379
I am having an affair with
Agness Adler's husband.

39:14.918 --> 39:17.478
Oh, God!
You're not.

39:17.587 --> 39:20.147
That is genius.

39:20.623 --> 39:23.820
Well, it's also
sort of wrong.

39:24.127 --> 39:26.095
I know. I know.

39:26.162 --> 39:27.891
Oh, please,
it's not that wrong.

39:27.964 --> 39:32.424
But I'm...
I'm so happy to be able
to tell somebody.

39:33.436 --> 39:37.133
This is the most
out-of-control thing
I've ever done in my life!

39:37.240 --> 39:38.605
Literally! You know me.

39:38.675 --> 39:39.972
Yes!
Yes! We do.

39:40.076 --> 39:41.407
You've never done
anything wrong

39:41.478 --> 39:42.604
or bad ever.
No.

39:42.679 --> 39:43.976
Ever!

39:44.047 --> 39:45.639
So,
you're allowed this one.

39:46.483 --> 39:47.507
Well...

39:47.584 --> 39:49.245
I'm sorry.
I kind of love it!

39:49.319 --> 39:50.980
And he was yours first.

39:51.054 --> 39:52.112
True.

39:52.756 --> 39:54.587
Not that
I want him back,
by the way.

39:54.657 --> 39:55.783
Of course not.
Oh, man.

39:55.859 --> 39:58.327
You can do better than Jake.

39:58.428 --> 40:00.020
Thanks.

40:00.096 --> 40:03.259
No. I mean,
you've outgrown him.

40:03.600 --> 40:06.763
You've blossomed.
You've feng shuied
your whole life.

40:06.836 --> 40:08.030
Yeah.

40:08.138 --> 40:10.538
Just please don't let him
talk you into saving him.

40:10.640 --> 40:12.267
I won't.

40:12.342 --> 40:14.970
Janey,
there's something
perfect about this.

40:15.044 --> 40:17.672
You don't have
to cook for him,
or clean up after him.

40:17.781 --> 40:19.646
You don't even actually
have to sleep with him.

40:19.716 --> 40:21.775
I know. I have
an ex with benefits.

40:23.286 --> 40:27.620
But, girls,
what about the fact that
I'm now the other woman?

40:27.690 --> 40:29.021
I'm the one we hate!

40:29.125 --> 40:31.787
Oh, forget about that.
Agness is still
the one we hate,

40:31.861 --> 40:33.055
even in this scenario.

40:33.163 --> 40:36.189
Yeah, karma is the
ultimate bitch in this one.

40:36.299 --> 40:37.459
Let's hope so.

40:37.534 --> 40:39.468
Okay, tell me everything!
You're not getting away
with anything.

40:39.536 --> 40:40.560
You tell me everything.

40:40.637 --> 40:43.367
I want details.
Details, details.
No, you earned this...

40:44.874 --> 40:45.863
Reynaldo!

40:45.942 --> 40:47.239
Mmm?

40:47.310 --> 40:49.870
I want to change
the breakfast menu.

40:49.979 --> 40:53.346
Give it more life.
What do you think?

40:53.416 --> 40:55.577
What did you do,
something to your hair?

40:55.685 --> 40:57.118
No, I don't think so.

40:57.187 --> 40:58.848
Something about you
looks different.

40:58.922 --> 41:00.480
<i>A little more caliente?</i>

41:00.557 --> 41:01.785
<i>Caliente?</i>

41:01.858 --> 41:03.052
You see it, Eddie?

41:03.159 --> 41:04.854
Whatever it is,
it's working.

41:06.563 --> 41:10.556
Hello?
Oh, no, I didn't
do this again.

41:11.100 --> 41:14.092
Adam,
I'm so sorry.

41:15.071 --> 41:18.370
My mind is just...
Forgive me.

41:18.441 --> 41:20.102
You know, if I were
your shrink, I'd say

41:20.210 --> 41:21.677
maybe you don't really
want to build this addition.

41:21.744 --> 41:24.406
Oh, no, no,
that's completely not true.

41:24.514 --> 41:25.674
I'm really sorry.

41:25.748 --> 41:26.874
It's okay.

41:26.950 --> 41:30.545
Oh, I like it already.

41:30.620 --> 41:34.454
Yeah, it's feeling
really good. So, this
becomes your office.

41:34.557 --> 41:35.581
Uh-huh.

41:35.658 --> 41:37.216
You come down
your new hallway.

41:37.293 --> 41:39.557
The windows all along here.
Okay.

41:39.629 --> 41:41.256
Great. Love it!

41:41.364 --> 41:45.460
And from here to there...
Well, let me get
the door for you.

41:48.204 --> 41:49.569
Your kitchen.

41:51.107 --> 41:54.099
We're in the eating area now.
How's the size feel?

41:54.210 --> 41:55.234
Good.

41:55.311 --> 41:57.108
Right now, we're at
either end of the table.

41:57.213 --> 41:59.943
Oh!
Well, it feels perfect!

42:00.049 --> 42:01.243
I thought so, too.

42:01.317 --> 42:04.150
Yeah. Oh!

42:06.956 --> 42:08.253
This is heaven!

42:08.324 --> 42:09.814
It's gonna be cool.

42:11.461 --> 42:12.655
You wanna go upstairs?

42:17.000 --> 42:19.298
Oh!

42:19.402 --> 42:22.963
So if you were lying in bed,
this would be your view.

42:23.072 --> 42:24.334
Oh!

42:35.251 --> 42:37.014
Oh, gosh!
Are you all right?

42:37.120 --> 42:40.351
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.
I'm fine. I'm...

42:43.493 --> 42:45.358
Janey?
Call me.

42:58.308 --> 42:59.468
Jake!

42:59.542 --> 43:00.873
Coming!

43:03.379 --> 43:05.279
What were you
doing in there?

43:05.348 --> 43:06.440
Going to the bathroom.

43:06.516 --> 43:07.881
The toilet isn't flushed.

43:07.984 --> 43:08.973
Yes, it did.

43:09.052 --> 43:10.110
Why were you in the shower

43:10.186 --> 43:12.120
with your clothes on?

43:12.188 --> 43:15.385
What are
you talking about?

43:15.491 --> 43:17.959
I heard the shower
door close, Jake.

43:18.027 --> 43:19.654
What do you have,
x-ray ears?

43:19.729 --> 43:21.196
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

43:21.297 --> 43:22.787
What's up, Pedro?

43:22.865 --> 43:25.732
Jake took a shower
with his clothes on.

43:27.570 --> 43:28.901
Oh, Pedro, darling.

43:29.005 --> 43:30.029
Well, what's he
talking about?

43:30.106 --> 43:31.300
I don't speak Pedro.

43:31.374 --> 43:33.239
That's your department.

43:33.343 --> 43:35.971
Don't go in the kitchen, P.
I broke something.

43:36.045 --> 43:38.206
Yo, can you help?

43:38.281 --> 43:39.509
Yo, can you?

43:45.254 --> 43:46.414
That looks amazing.

43:46.522 --> 43:49.320
It's called
croque-monsieur.

43:49.392 --> 43:52.987
It was the first thing
I learned to make when
I was living in Paris

43:53.062 --> 43:55.087
because the ingredients
are really, really cheap.

43:55.198 --> 43:56.597
When did you
live in Paris?

43:56.699 --> 43:59.566
When I was in
my early 20s.

43:59.669 --> 44:02.399
I went there to take
a six-day pastry class,

44:02.472 --> 44:03.666
and I ended up
staying a year

44:03.740 --> 44:06.368
working as an apprentice
in a bakery.

44:06.442 --> 44:07.773
Wow, that's brave.

44:11.014 --> 44:13.278
Thank you for taking
my 47 e-mails

44:13.349 --> 44:15.579
and turning them into
something so beautiful.

44:15.685 --> 44:17.050
You are rapidly becoming

44:17.120 --> 44:18.883
one of the most
appreciative clients
I've ever had.

44:18.955 --> 44:21.583
I don't know
what it is but I...

44:22.258 --> 44:24.749
I'm always surprised
when I can count
on someone.

44:26.195 --> 44:28.095
Really?
 Yeah.

44:42.378 --> 44:45.609
I know it's none
of my business,
but I was just

44:45.715 --> 44:48.741
trying to figure out
why someone like you
is divorced.

44:48.818 --> 44:50.547
And what did
you come up with?

44:50.620 --> 44:53.088
Something in the
"you're too nice"
department.

44:53.156 --> 44:56.125
That, and my wife
fell in love with
my best friend.

44:56.225 --> 44:58.785
Oh! No.
Ex-best friend.

44:58.895 --> 45:01.625
We were on a biking trip,
he and his wife
and me and my wife,

45:01.731 --> 45:04.894
through Tuscany,
and on the last day
of the trip,

45:04.967 --> 45:06.332
they announced that
they were in love.

45:06.436 --> 45:08.427
How awful!

45:08.504 --> 45:09.801
Not a great
plane ride home.

45:09.872 --> 45:12.340
Oh! I can just imagine.

45:12.442 --> 45:14.205
Sitting there
for hours and hours

45:14.277 --> 45:16.108
with your wife,
who you know is...

45:16.179 --> 45:17.203
Oh, that's rough.

45:17.280 --> 45:18.770
Well, actually,
they went on to Venice.

45:18.848 --> 45:20.975
I flew home with Carol,
that's his ex-wife.

45:21.084 --> 45:24.110
And you can't
imagine what it's like
sitting next to someone

45:24.187 --> 45:26.815
who's crying on a plane
for 10 straight hours.

45:26.923 --> 45:28.015
I don't blame her.

45:28.091 --> 45:29.115
I'm talking about me.

45:31.494 --> 45:32.518
But anyway,
they're married now,

45:32.595 --> 45:35.325
and it's pretty much
an ongoing awful thing.

45:35.431 --> 45:37.058
But you and your ex,
when he stopped by

45:37.133 --> 45:38.623
the other morning
for coffee,

45:38.701 --> 45:41.261
I thought, "Wow.
That's the way
it's supposed to be."

45:41.337 --> 45:43.100
You two really seem
to have it figured out.

45:43.172 --> 45:46.767
Well... Yeah.
We're not as figured out
as you'd think.

46:04.060 --> 46:07.962
I hope you don't think
that I've been
interrogating you,

46:08.030 --> 46:11.329
but I know what
it's like to have
an ex who's remarried

46:11.400 --> 46:14.198
and not have that much
going on in that area.

46:14.303 --> 46:17.568
I mean,
do you date ever? Or...

46:17.673 --> 46:20.073
Oh, constantly, actually.

46:20.176 --> 46:21.200
Constantly? Really?

46:21.277 --> 46:22.539
Yeah. Everyone I know

46:22.645 --> 46:24.545
or have ever known
has fixed me up

46:24.614 --> 46:25.911
and sometimes
I just meet women.

46:25.982 --> 46:27.973
I don't really know
how it happens, but...

46:28.050 --> 46:30.848
But
no girlfriend yet?

46:30.920 --> 46:31.978
Not yet.

46:32.054 --> 46:34.022
Mmm-hmm.
Just like dating.

46:34.590 --> 46:36.524
Actually, I find it
really stressful.

46:36.592 --> 46:39.755
You know, the last time
I was in the dating world
was 1978.

46:40.997 --> 46:42.191
And it's so much more
complicated these days.

46:42.265 --> 46:43.323
Oh, I know.

46:43.399 --> 46:44.423
I can't tell you
how nice it is

46:44.500 --> 46:45.865
to have a conversation
with a woman

46:45.935 --> 46:49.769
and have the pressure off,
not to mention
a home-cooked...

46:49.872 --> 46:51.601
That was
a compliment.

46:51.707 --> 46:53.265
Yeah.

46:53.376 --> 46:55.537
Do you have a guy
in your life at...
At the moment?

46:55.611 --> 46:57.374
No.
No?

46:57.446 --> 46:59.414
No.

47:29.812 --> 47:31.973
This was so nice
and relaxing.

47:32.081 --> 47:34.879
And the lavender ice cream
was the best dessert
of any sort

47:34.951 --> 47:36.919
I've ever had,
like, in my life.

47:36.986 --> 47:38.180
Aw! Oh! Thanks.

47:38.254 --> 47:40.222
I always make ice cream
when I can't sleep,

47:40.289 --> 47:41.813
so I'm glad someone
was here to eat it.

47:43.392 --> 47:44.586
Great getting to
know you a little.

47:44.660 --> 47:47.561
Yeah, it was really fun.

47:48.297 --> 47:50.231
Well...

47:53.336 --> 47:54.394
Bye. Okay.

47:54.470 --> 47:55.994
Bye.

48:01.410 --> 48:02.570
Bye.

48:14.991 --> 48:17.755
What? I'm coming.

48:22.164 --> 48:24.928
O.M.G., I thought
he'd never leave.

48:26.702 --> 48:28.329
Hello, Jane.
 Hi.

48:28.437 --> 48:30.166
You're looking very
beautiful tonight.

48:31.641 --> 48:32.869
Oh, I love when you
smell like butter.

48:32.942 --> 48:34.273
What are you doing here?

48:34.343 --> 48:35.674
Missed you.
Mmm-hmm.

48:35.778 --> 48:38.713
It's 9:00.
Where does your wife
think you are?

48:39.048 --> 48:42.142
Yoga. Shall we do some
downward-facing dog,
perhaps?

48:42.218 --> 48:44.311
Not tonight, big guy.

48:44.387 --> 48:45.718
Is it really
necessary for you

48:45.788 --> 48:48.450
to always say no
before you say yes?

48:48.524 --> 48:50.151
I'm not gonna think
less of you, you know.

48:50.226 --> 48:52.524
Really, Jake.
I'm a little tired

48:52.595 --> 48:54.961
and I was gonna
take a bath, and just...

48:55.031 --> 48:57.966
Okay. So we'll
just hang out.

48:58.034 --> 49:00.502
Is that
croque-monsieur?

49:00.569 --> 49:01.627
Yeah.

49:01.704 --> 49:03.729
Whose plate is this,
yours or his?
 That's mine.

49:06.242 --> 49:08.642
My God! Just like
I remember it.

49:09.412 --> 49:12.347
Don't you ever eat
at your house?

49:12.415 --> 49:15.873
Pedro dictates most meals,
and he has a very

49:15.985 --> 49:17.646
limited palate.
Mmm-hmm.

49:17.720 --> 49:18.948
What kind of
ice cream is that?

49:19.021 --> 49:20.454
Lavender honey.

49:20.523 --> 49:21.683
Not sleeping?

49:21.757 --> 49:23.748
Not at all. You?

49:25.094 --> 49:26.755
Never slept better.
Mmm-hmm.

49:26.862 --> 49:29.922
And my digestion is
finally back on track.

49:30.032 --> 49:33.001
You've turned my world
right-side up, Jane.

49:33.602 --> 49:36.662
You know what
that means, don't you?

49:36.739 --> 49:39.003
No.

49:41.444 --> 49:45.346
That I've never
really known how
to live without you.

49:53.222 --> 49:56.783
You know,
maybe we should be
growing old together.

49:56.892 --> 50:03.855
I hate
to tell you, big guy,
we already grew old, apart.

50:04.100 --> 50:05.294
What is with the "big guy"?

50:05.401 --> 50:09.098
Is it because I'm fat,
or is it a term
of endearment?

50:09.171 --> 50:13.005
I have no idea
why I keep saying that.
I'm sorry. I'll stop.

50:13.109 --> 50:14.474
Thank you.

50:16.312 --> 50:17.802
I love how quiet
it is in your house.

50:17.880 --> 50:19.313
Mmm.

50:20.316 --> 50:23.513
I have no quiet
in my life. Ever.

50:24.120 --> 50:26.520
Well, you live
with a 5-year-old.

50:26.622 --> 50:28.852
Yes. And let's
not forget Pedro.

50:32.661 --> 50:37.997
What are you saying, exactly?
What's going on over
there at your place?

50:42.038 --> 50:43.972
My marriage is

50:45.107 --> 50:48.167
not turning out
as I hoped.
That's obvious.

50:48.277 --> 50:53.010
Agness started out
really looking up to me.
We never used to fight.

50:53.115 --> 50:54.810
But now with
the kid, lately,

50:54.884 --> 50:57.546
we're all about what
school he's going to

50:57.653 --> 51:00.952
and she thinks we
need a bigger house,
more help.

51:01.023 --> 51:03.014
I was hoping to
cut back at work,

51:03.092 --> 51:05.060
but now that's
never gonna happen.

51:05.161 --> 51:06.185
And she wants to
have another baby

51:06.262 --> 51:08.753
before Pedro gets
too old, which I get.

51:08.831 --> 51:11.493
But since we're
always fighting...

51:11.600 --> 51:14.160
Oh, God.
Listen to me.

51:15.538 --> 51:18.439
Isn't a baby part of
the deal when you marry
a woman that age?

51:18.507 --> 51:21.271
Is it? I guess so.

51:21.811 --> 51:25.144
She's got me booked
at the fertility center
every other day,

51:25.214 --> 51:27.944
and she is so amped up
on hormone injections,

51:28.017 --> 51:30.781
I'm gonna have
to find an exorcist if
she doesn't calm down.

51:32.855 --> 51:34.720
I wish it was funny.

51:35.825 --> 51:37.053
Incredible ice cream.

51:37.126 --> 51:38.320
Hmm.

51:38.394 --> 51:40.794
I'm turning around.

51:40.863 --> 51:43.798
Hey, remember when
we used to smoke pot

51:43.866 --> 51:45.925
and eat your ice cream
in the hot tub?

51:46.001 --> 51:51.234
The hot tub?
That feels like
a billion years ago.

51:51.340 --> 51:53.968
Yeah. How long has
it been since you, uh...

51:55.244 --> 51:58.304
Me? Since before
Lauren was born.

51:58.380 --> 51:59.711
Twenty-seven years.

51:59.782 --> 52:00.908
At least.

52:00.983 --> 52:02.143
Huh?

52:04.053 --> 52:08.581
Are you kidding me?
Oh, put that away.
Oh! It's been too long.

52:08.691 --> 52:10.522
Exactly.
 I'm not gonna...

52:10.593 --> 52:14.495
Okay. I'm gonna
leave this for you.
It's kind of amazing.

52:14.563 --> 52:18.021
You take a few hits,
get your sea legs back,

52:18.100 --> 52:20.762
and, uh, we'll finish
the rest of it together.

52:20.836 --> 52:21.996
Maybe.

52:22.071 --> 52:26.201
So, that nerdy
architect likes you.
You know that, right?

52:26.275 --> 52:28.209
He's not nerdy.

52:28.277 --> 52:30.711
And he definitely doesn't.

52:30.779 --> 52:32.269
We're just...
We're working together.

52:32.381 --> 52:35.373
I was watching
while you leaned over
to open the oven,

52:35.451 --> 52:39.751
and his eyes were
glued to your ass.

52:39.855 --> 52:41.789
Hey, do me a favor?

52:44.226 --> 52:46.956
Tell me the truth, Janey.
Is this a great
affair or what?

52:47.029 --> 52:49.827
I don't know.
It's my first.

52:49.899 --> 52:53.164
We don't even
have to have sex,
and it's fun.

52:54.403 --> 52:55.529
I wish I could sleep over.

52:55.638 --> 52:59.734
I got to talk
to my shrink about this.
This is...

52:59.842 --> 53:03.334
This is a lot to handle.
You better go, I guess.

53:08.150 --> 53:09.412
It's okay.

53:09.518 --> 53:11.076
No.

53:11.854 --> 53:14.652
Whoa!
What is happening, Jake?

53:31.540 --> 53:32.564
Don't get it.

53:32.641 --> 53:35.201
I always get it.
I have three kids.

53:37.246 --> 53:40.943
Hello? Hi. You're still
on the phone?

53:42.685 --> 53:45.176
Plane,
I meant plane.

53:46.021 --> 53:48.922
Uh-huh? Well, how was Luke
when you left him?

53:49.024 --> 53:53.188
Oh, that sounds like fun.
Yeah, let me know
what I can bring.

53:53.262 --> 53:56.288
No! I have no idea
where he is.

53:57.366 --> 53:59.095
Okay, sweetheart.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

53:59.201 --> 54:00.930
Oh! Now I'm lying.

54:02.371 --> 54:03.998
Lauren and Harley
are giving Luke

54:04.073 --> 54:07.372
a graduation party
this weekend.
Sweet, huh?

54:10.379 --> 54:13.075
Hello, stranger.
Welcome back.

54:13.882 --> 54:16.612
I'm, uh, just getting
into my car.

54:16.719 --> 54:19.347
Yeah, this weekend
sounds great.

54:19.421 --> 54:20.752
Let me know
what I can bring.

54:23.359 --> 54:24.383
Okay.

54:36.505 --> 54:39.531
Why am I laughing?
I mean, it's like nuts!

54:49.351 --> 54:51.012
Dr. Allen.

54:51.120 --> 54:52.678
Jane, hi.
Am I seeing you today?

54:52.788 --> 54:55.154
Oh, no.
I just wanted to talk.
And I was wondering

54:55.257 --> 54:58.021
if by any chance you
could squeeze me in for
an emergency session?

54:58.127 --> 55:00.789
Because I'm sort of in
desperate need of advice.

55:00.863 --> 55:03.093
I brought you
some coffee cake
that you like.

55:03.165 --> 55:05.326
Not as a bribe
or anything. But...

55:05.434 --> 55:07.026
I only have 20 minutes
before my first patient.

55:07.136 --> 55:09.104
Well, that's fine!
I'll talk fast.

55:09.171 --> 55:13.801
So at this point,
I just need some sound,
unbiased guidance.

55:15.010 --> 55:19.947
Is having an affair
with you-know-who
a good thing or a bad thing?

55:21.283 --> 55:23.717
It's a bad thing, right?
This can't be...
How can it be good?

55:23.819 --> 55:26.117
It's not good,
it's not bad.

55:28.257 --> 55:30.623
I've made a list
of everything

55:30.693 --> 55:33.594
this could possibly
be about at my end.

55:35.364 --> 55:36.388
May I read it to you?

55:36.465 --> 55:38.592
Oh, please, of course.

55:38.967 --> 55:40.594
Uh...

55:40.669 --> 55:43.297
Because
I e-mailed it to myself.

55:45.541 --> 55:48.442
Okay. "Am I still
trying to figure out
why the marriage failed?

55:48.510 --> 55:50.876
"Do I want to
get back together?

55:50.979 --> 55:53.812
"Do we have
unfinished business?

55:53.882 --> 55:57.443
"Is this about revenge?
Or am I...

56:05.394 --> 56:07.191
"Am I just lonely?

56:07.296 --> 56:08.593
"Or is it my
caretaker thing?"

56:08.664 --> 56:10.598
I mean, the kids
are finally gone now,

56:10.666 --> 56:12.190
and all of
a sudden Jake is back,

56:12.267 --> 56:14.895
and I get to take care
of him in some way.

56:14.970 --> 56:18.838
Now, I understand.
I get how therapy works.
I really do.

56:19.708 --> 56:22.700
We look at things,
we examine them.
Weeks turn into months.

56:22.811 --> 56:24.403
And we're going
on eight years now.

56:25.681 --> 56:27.876
And I'm okay with that.
I really am, believe me.

56:27.983 --> 56:30.144
I... I like it, I do.

56:30.219 --> 56:34.246
But in this case,
I need you to tell me
what you really think.

56:34.356 --> 56:38.053
Like, "Don't do this."

56:38.160 --> 56:39.855
You know,
I'd like you to say,

56:39.928 --> 56:41.919
"Don't do this.
It's absolutely wrong,"

56:42.030 --> 56:44.430
or, "Go ahead.
You'll be fine."

56:45.401 --> 56:48.234
I actually want to
be told what to do.

56:49.004 --> 56:51.529
What's interesting is,
I'm already
seeing you open up

56:51.607 --> 56:53.404
more than you have
in some time.

56:53.509 --> 56:55.568
I'm thinking,
through this affair,

56:55.677 --> 56:59.113
you may learn
to view the world
in a different way.

57:00.716 --> 57:04.174
I'm sorry, what...
I just need something
more concrete.

57:04.253 --> 57:09.020
I'm... Are you saying
that I should just
keep seeing him?

57:09.091 --> 57:11.958
Because honestly,
I think that if the guilt...

57:14.296 --> 57:17.788
The guilt and the fear
could go away,
I could just...

57:17.900 --> 57:22.064
I could let go
a little bit and,
um, you know,

57:23.305 --> 57:25.136
I could figure this out.

57:25.707 --> 57:27.868
I wouldn't resist
looking at this.

57:29.211 --> 57:32.942
Okay. And another
way of saying that
might be...

57:33.048 --> 57:35.744
Let go, Jane.
It can't hurt.

57:38.353 --> 57:39.479
Thank you.

57:47.296 --> 57:48.661
Santa Barbara
Fertility Center,

57:48.730 --> 57:50.960
will you please hold?
Thank you.

57:57.506 --> 57:59.940
Jacob Adler?

58:00.008 --> 58:01.100
Have fun.

58:03.178 --> 58:06.170
Okay, you know the drill.
You can hang your things
in the closet.

58:06.281 --> 58:08.943
The remote's on the dresser,
and the materials
are in the drawer.

58:09.017 --> 58:10.951
Please deposit your
specimen in the cup,

58:11.019 --> 58:13.579
and I'll see you
when you're done.

58:25.200 --> 58:27.065
Hey, where are you?

58:27.135 --> 58:28.898
Uh,
I'm at the office.

58:28.971 --> 58:30.029
Want to grab some lunch?

58:30.105 --> 58:31.800
Absolutely. When?

58:31.874 --> 58:33.466
<i>Can you do it now?
I have about an hour.</i>

58:33.542 --> 58:35.772
We could meet
at the Stanhope,
get room service.

58:37.145 --> 58:38.339
I'll be there in 10.

58:38.413 --> 58:40.278
See you there, Adler.

58:43.852 --> 58:46.787
She's coming back.

58:51.360 --> 58:52.486
Oh,
I'm not kidding.

58:52.561 --> 58:55.155
That is exactly
what the guy said.
I'm stunned.

58:55.230 --> 58:56.788
Look at me.
I'm still stunned.

58:56.865 --> 58:58.560
Oh, by the way,
I talked to my brother
this morning

58:58.667 --> 58:59.725
and he is so excited
about his party.

58:59.801 --> 59:00.790
Really?

59:00.869 --> 59:01.995
Mmm-hmm.
Great!

59:02.070 --> 59:04.163
We can fit 40 people
in our place, can't we?

59:04.239 --> 59:06.332
Absolutely.
People won't sit down, but...

59:07.709 --> 59:08.903
No big deal, right?

59:09.011 --> 59:10.876
Hi.
Reservation.
The name is Adler.

59:11.079 --> 59:12.239
Hey. There's your...

59:12.314 --> 59:13.406
My what?

59:13.549 --> 59:14.675
And here's your key.

59:18.720 --> 59:19.709
Harley!

59:19.788 --> 59:20.982
I'm really sorry,
I didn't mean
to spit on you.

59:21.557 --> 59:23.525
I just had to kiss you.
While you were choking?

59:23.592 --> 59:25.389
Yeah, but it worked.
'Cause I'm not really
choking anymore.

59:25.400 --> 59:27.129
Who did you just see?

59:27.235 --> 59:28.497
No one. That was weird.

59:28.603 --> 59:34.405
I thought it was your
cousin from... From...
Oh, my sweet lord.

59:34.843 --> 59:35.901
Now what?

59:35.977 --> 59:36.966
Honey, I just totally forgot.

59:37.078 --> 59:39.012
I have
a conference call at 1:15.

59:39.113 --> 59:40.307
Back at the office,
so I gotta go.

59:40.415 --> 59:42.975
Waitress! Honey,
I'm serious. Stop eating.
Help me call the waitress.

59:43.084 --> 59:44.415
Anyone over here.
Look over there.
Call that one.

59:44.486 --> 59:45.817
No. Harley. Harley. Harley.
Harley, we can't leave.

59:45.920 --> 59:47.114
We're meeting with
the wedding specialist.

59:47.188 --> 59:48.519
Yeah, and you know what?

59:48.623 --> 59:52.115
Mmm, I just don't know
if today's the best day
for me for that.

59:53.127 --> 59:54.788
Oh, my God!

59:59.834 --> 01:00:02.962
<i>When you just give love</i>

01:00:03.137 --> 01:00:06.197
<i>And never get love</i>

01:00:07.041 --> 01:00:12.479
<i>You'd better let love depart</i>

01:00:14.182 --> 01:00:16.946
<i>I know it's so</i>

01:00:17.552 --> 01:00:20.851
<i>And yet I know</i>

01:00:20.955 --> 01:00:26.825
<i>I can't get you
out of my heart</i>

01:00:32.967 --> 01:00:36.403
<i>You</i>

01:00:37.705 --> 01:00:43.234
<i>Made me leave my happy home</i>

01:00:44.913 --> 01:00:50.044
<i>You took my love
and now you're gone</i>

01:00:52.253 --> 01:00:56.485
<i>Since I fell for you</i>

01:01:03.064 --> 01:01:05.658
<i>Your sweet love</i>

01:01:06.167 --> 01:01:08.362
<i>Brings such misery...</i>

01:01:08.436 --> 01:01:12.338
Jake? Jake! Jake!

01:01:12.707 --> 01:01:15.733
I adore October weddings.
Let me show you something
we did last October.

01:01:15.843 --> 01:01:17.208
Stunning, right?

01:01:17.278 --> 01:01:18.336
And you can do as
much of the flowers

01:01:18.413 --> 01:01:19.437
or as little
as you want...

01:01:19.514 --> 01:01:20.947
Hey, hon, I'm gonna
make that call from...

01:01:21.049 --> 01:01:22.346
...keeping with
an autumnal theme.
Great.

01:01:22.417 --> 01:01:24.180
This is a gorgeous cake...
You guys just
keep doing this,

01:01:24.252 --> 01:01:25.514
and I'm gonna...
...with the
chocolate ribbons.

01:01:25.587 --> 01:01:27.748
Oh, I love it.

01:01:29.057 --> 01:01:30.285
Ah! Doctor.

01:01:30.358 --> 01:01:32.155
Hi. I received a call
about a Mr. Adler.

01:01:32.226 --> 01:01:35.389
Yes, 408.
His wife says
he's conscious now.

01:01:35.463 --> 01:01:36.896
I'm on my way.

01:01:39.968 --> 01:01:41.936
Okay. Blood pressure's good.

01:01:42.036 --> 01:01:43.230
How is his heart?

01:01:43.571 --> 01:01:44.868
Do you have
a heart condition,
Mr. Adler?

01:01:44.939 --> 01:01:46.531
No. And I just
had a check-up.

01:01:46.608 --> 01:01:48.132
You did? That's good.

01:01:48.242 --> 01:01:50.608
And when you got dizzy,
did you feel your heart
was beating funny?

01:01:50.712 --> 01:01:53.772
Yes. But I was
admiring my beautiful...

01:01:54.248 --> 01:01:55.772
It's nice to hear
after all these years.
That's great.

01:01:56.985 --> 01:01:58.577
Did you forget to take
any medications today?

01:01:58.653 --> 01:02:00.450
Took 'em all.
What all did you take?

01:02:00.555 --> 01:02:03.718
Lipitor, baby aspirin.
Flomax.

01:02:05.627 --> 01:02:06.651
Flomax?

01:02:06.728 --> 01:02:10.596
Yes. Otherwise,
I pee 40 times a day.

01:02:10.665 --> 01:02:12.428
How long have you
been taking the Flomax?

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:16.561
Not long.
I only take it sporadically.
I have to sneak it, actually.

01:02:17.005 --> 01:02:21.669
It reduces semen,
which is not good for
my wife right now. Sorry.

01:02:24.679 --> 01:02:25.737
Really?

01:02:25.813 --> 01:02:27.781
Yes. I prefer
a lot of semen.

01:02:28.082 --> 01:02:29.982
I always have.
Wow.

01:02:30.084 --> 01:02:33.315
Okay, so good.
Thanks so much for coming.

01:02:33.421 --> 01:02:34.445
Looks like
he's going to live.

01:02:34.522 --> 01:02:35.955
Yes. My guess is Flomax

01:02:36.024 --> 01:02:38.083
is probably
the culprit here.

01:02:38.159 --> 01:02:40.093
I suggest you stay off
that for a few weeks.

01:02:40.495 --> 01:02:42.929
Which, apparently,
your wife will appreciate.

01:02:43.998 --> 01:02:45.295
Yeah, really good for me.

01:02:45.366 --> 01:02:46.560
And I suggest
you rest quietly

01:02:46.634 --> 01:02:47.760
for the rest
of the afternoon.

01:02:47.835 --> 01:02:49.097
No hanky-panky, Mrs. Adler.

01:02:49.170 --> 01:02:51.934
No chance,
I can assure you.

01:02:59.947 --> 01:03:03.508
Okay,
are you acting like this
because of the wedding?

01:03:04.185 --> 01:03:05.482
Tell me the truth.

01:03:05.553 --> 01:03:07.453
Not at all, I swear to God.

01:03:07.522 --> 01:03:09.353
Because I really
don't want to be
one of those couples

01:03:09.424 --> 01:03:10.755
where the guy
goes into a coma

01:03:10.825 --> 01:03:12.816
the whole time
we plan the wedding.
God, no. Please.

01:03:12.894 --> 01:03:14.293
It's not
worth it to me.

01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:17.458
He's fine.

01:03:18.399 --> 01:03:19.696
Okay!

01:03:19.801 --> 01:03:22.998
We are back in business!
Oh, honey!

01:03:23.071 --> 01:03:26.336
<i>Don't you just love it
when a song raises you up,</i>

01:03:26.407 --> 01:03:28.898
<i>makes you think
you can do anything</i>

01:03:28.976 --> 01:03:30.443
<i>when all you have
to do is hear it</i>

01:03:30.511 --> 01:03:32.570
<i>and you're motivated,
you're inspired,</i>

01:03:33.815 --> 01:03:35.305
<i>... you don't
stop believing...
See? Just that move?</i>

01:03:35.383 --> 01:03:38.546
You have no idea.
Not everyone's like that.

01:03:40.421 --> 01:03:44.858
Jake, I have
a confession to make.

01:03:48.696 --> 01:03:50.425
Back when we broke up...

01:03:53.034 --> 01:03:55.264
I knew it wasn't
all your fault.

01:03:57.371 --> 01:03:59.362
You mean that?
You've never said
that to me before.

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:00.839
I know.

01:04:01.909 --> 01:04:04.036
Because when you cheated,
I didn't have to.

01:04:08.549 --> 01:04:13.612
I think in some way
I gave up on us.

01:04:15.556 --> 01:04:17.751
And I'm not sure
you ever really did.

01:04:20.061 --> 01:04:21.289
I still haven't.

01:04:26.367 --> 01:04:28.392
Are you and Agness
still having sex?

01:04:37.044 --> 01:04:38.204
Only if she initiates it.

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:41.311
I'm trying not to rock
the boat at home

01:04:41.382 --> 01:04:43.145
until you and I
figure this out.

01:04:43.251 --> 01:04:45.310
It's a lot trickier
at my end than yours.

01:04:45.419 --> 01:04:48.320
Right. Yeah. Okay.

01:04:51.292 --> 01:04:52.691
I know you're going to
think I'm leaving now

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:53.988
because of what
you just said,

01:04:54.061 --> 01:04:55.995
but, I really...
I have to get back
to work.

01:05:07.642 --> 01:05:10.406
We got really close
there for a moment.

01:05:18.319 --> 01:05:20.116
<i>Hello?
Hi.</i>

01:05:20.188 --> 01:05:21.985
<i>Adam?
I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?</i>

01:05:22.089 --> 01:05:23.818
Hi.

01:05:24.425 --> 01:05:27.588
Hey, I just found out
there's a French film
festival in town

01:05:27.662 --> 01:05:29.493
and made me think of you.

01:05:29.597 --> 01:05:30.928
So I was wondering
if you might want to go

01:05:30.998 --> 01:05:32.522
to the
opening night tomorrow.

01:05:32.633 --> 01:05:35.124
Oh, that sounds so fun!

01:05:35.503 --> 01:05:38.768
Tomorrow night?
Um, let me think.

01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:40.865
Tomorrow night.
Tomorrow's what?

01:05:40.975 --> 01:05:42.101
Say you're busy.

01:05:42.176 --> 01:05:43.700
Agness has got
a dinner thing tomorrow.

01:05:43.811 --> 01:05:45.472
I can come over.

01:05:47.048 --> 01:05:48.879
Come on.

01:05:52.787 --> 01:05:55.483
You know,
I would really love to.

01:05:55.556 --> 01:05:58.684
But my son is coming home
from college the next day,

01:05:59.126 --> 01:06:00.491
<i>and I have
a bunch of things</i>

01:06:00.561 --> 01:06:02.688
<i>that I have to do
to get ready.</i>

01:06:03.130 --> 01:06:06.031
I'm really sorry.

01:06:06.567 --> 01:06:08.432
Yeah. It's no problem.
We can...

01:06:08.502 --> 01:06:09.833
Maybe we can see
something another night.

01:06:09.904 --> 01:06:11.531
<i>Absolutely.
I'd love that.</i>

01:06:11.639 --> 01:06:13.004
<i>Take care.
You, too.</i>

01:06:22.650 --> 01:06:24.174
Hey, Melanie,
how would you
and your husband

01:06:24.252 --> 01:06:26.379
like two tickets to
the French Film Festival?

01:06:26.454 --> 01:06:28.115
Reserved seating,
VIP parking.

01:06:28.189 --> 01:06:29.918
Seriously? Thanks, Adam.

01:06:34.295 --> 01:06:36.229
You'll make the whole thing?
The roast chicken?

01:06:36.330 --> 01:06:40.528
And mashed potatoes.
And sautÃ©ed string beans.

01:06:41.068 --> 01:06:43.536
And double fudge
chocolate cake.

01:06:44.171 --> 01:06:46.696
I know your
favorite dinner, Jakey.

01:06:47.241 --> 01:06:49.175
You haven't called me
"Jakey" in 10 years.

01:06:51.045 --> 01:06:53.741
So, do we have a date?

01:06:58.853 --> 01:07:00.878
We have a date.

01:07:50.571 --> 01:07:52.869
Why are you
taking your cell
to the bathroom?

01:07:54.709 --> 01:07:57.576
Oh. I didn't mean to.

01:07:57.812 --> 01:07:59.712
Carry him
to his bed, will you?

01:08:00.748 --> 01:08:02.545
Yeah.

01:08:07.388 --> 01:08:10.118
And hurry back.
I'm ovulating.

01:08:11.225 --> 01:08:12.249
You are?

01:08:12.326 --> 01:08:13.486
Why do you think
I canceled my dinner?

01:09:35.509 --> 01:09:36.669
Oh, Mom, I keep
forgetting to tell you

01:09:36.743 --> 01:09:38.439
about our meeting
at the Stanhope.

01:09:38.511 --> 01:09:40.002
We went there
for lunch two days ago

01:09:40.081 --> 01:09:41.412
and met with our
wedding specialist,

01:09:41.482 --> 01:09:43.006
and I think
it could be the place.

01:09:43.084 --> 01:09:44.915
Two days ago, you went
to the Stanhope for lunch?

01:09:45.019 --> 01:09:46.145
Yes, we did.

01:09:46.554 --> 01:09:47.680
And we saw nothing.

01:09:47.755 --> 01:09:49.654
Harley, what is that
supposed to mean?

01:09:49.723 --> 01:09:51.247
Who wants wine? Anyone?

01:09:51.358 --> 01:09:55.089
Mom, you have an insane
amount of food in here,
even for you.

01:09:55.196 --> 01:09:57.426
Well, I knew
everybody was coming
for the weekend,

01:09:57.531 --> 01:10:00.329
so I just made a bunch
of stuff last night.

01:10:00.401 --> 01:10:02.028
Looks like Dad's
favorite meal.

01:10:02.103 --> 01:10:03.764
Very funny.

01:10:03.838 --> 01:10:04.896
Very.

01:10:05.639 --> 01:10:06.731
Oh, my gosh.

01:10:06.807 --> 01:10:08.297
Yay, he's home.

01:10:08.375 --> 01:10:09.399
Yay.

01:10:10.244 --> 01:10:11.541
Oh, my God.

01:10:14.048 --> 01:10:15.174
Harley.
Yes!

01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:18.445
Hey!
Hi.

01:10:18.886 --> 01:10:20.444
Here he is!
Hi, darling.

01:10:20.521 --> 01:10:21.852
Hi, Mom.

01:10:22.556 --> 01:10:24.683
Mom, this looks amazing!

01:10:24.758 --> 01:10:25.850
Welcome home.

01:10:25.926 --> 01:10:27.450
- Thanks.
- How you doing?

01:10:27.561 --> 01:10:29.461
- Good.
- Oh.

01:10:29.964 --> 01:10:31.454
Look at this.

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.058
It smells so good.
I am starving.

01:10:34.135 --> 01:10:35.159
Hi.

01:10:35.236 --> 01:10:36.726
Hey.

01:10:36.804 --> 01:10:38.237
Where should I put this?

01:10:38.305 --> 01:10:39.465
Wherever.

01:10:41.942 --> 01:10:43.842
That looks incredible.

01:10:44.645 --> 01:10:46.272
Thanks.

01:10:47.114 --> 01:10:49.014
Jake, glass of wine?

01:10:49.116 --> 01:10:50.913
Uh, sure, thanks.
Jane?

01:10:50.985 --> 01:10:52.282
No, thank you.

01:10:56.023 --> 01:10:58.856
Hi, Agness.
Just got here.

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:01.628
Okay, I will.
Yeah. No, I know.

01:11:06.634 --> 01:11:07.896
Sorry, guys,
I gotta hit it.

01:11:07.968 --> 01:11:09.026
Bye-bye.

01:11:09.103 --> 01:11:10.161
I've gotta
stop at the market.

01:11:10.271 --> 01:11:11.738
Agness made
some pasta thing,

01:11:11.805 --> 01:11:13.170
and she ran
out of olive oil.

01:11:13.274 --> 01:11:14.969
At least she's
finally cooking.

01:11:15.042 --> 01:11:17.602
So, uh, I'll see you guys
at the party tomorrow.

01:11:17.678 --> 01:11:19.441
Yeah. It's gonna be so fun.

01:11:19.513 --> 01:11:21.276
I told you I'm bringing
someone, right?

01:11:21.348 --> 01:11:22.781
No. Who?

01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:24.715
Adam, my architect.

01:11:25.786 --> 01:11:27.185
You're bringing
your architect?

01:11:27.254 --> 01:11:28.414
Yes, I am.

01:11:28.489 --> 01:11:29.478
Like, as a date?

01:11:29.557 --> 01:11:30.546
Yeah.

01:11:30.624 --> 01:11:32.615
I like the idea.
Me, too!

01:11:32.726 --> 01:11:35.991
Yeah, I think
it's gonna really round
everything out nicely.

01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:38.896
No one's drinking
wine but me. No?

01:11:38.999 --> 01:11:41.490
Here. Now you can stay
another five minutes.

01:11:41.569 --> 01:11:43.366
Hey.
You have
three bottles in there.

01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:46.962
Janey, could I speak
with you privately
just for a sec?

01:11:51.745 --> 01:11:53.178
Okay. Okay.
Yeah...

01:11:55.816 --> 01:11:59.308
All right.
I think someone's talking
graduation gift.

01:12:03.490 --> 01:12:04.650
What is it, Jake?

01:12:04.992 --> 01:12:06.584
I don't get not
calling me back.

01:12:06.694 --> 01:12:10.095
Okay, I don't care
what your excuse is.

01:12:10.264 --> 01:12:11.822
So, that's it.

01:12:11.899 --> 01:12:14.424
She didn't go out, Jane.
She changed her plans.

01:12:14.535 --> 01:12:17.265
And every time
I tried to call or write,
she caught me.

01:12:17.371 --> 01:12:18.633
I wanted to be here.

01:12:18.706 --> 01:12:20.367
You know what?

01:12:21.775 --> 01:12:23.868
You were
worried about rocking
the boat at home.

01:12:23.944 --> 01:12:26.742
Well,
you're rocking my boat now.
And I don't like it!

01:12:26.847 --> 01:12:28.781
Honey, don't let
one night...
You don't understand.

01:12:28.882 --> 01:12:32.181
I'm not...
I'm not even blaming you.
I fully participated in this.

01:12:32.253 --> 01:12:34.585
But I just don't
want to do it anymore.

01:12:36.257 --> 01:12:37.554
The last thing
in the whole world

01:12:37.625 --> 01:12:39.718
I should be right now
is your mistress.

01:12:40.194 --> 01:12:44.290
Sitting around
at 9:00 at night,
wearing heels and perfume

01:12:45.366 --> 01:12:46.424
and blowing all
the candles out

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:47.967
and wrapping
everything in Saran Wrap

01:12:48.068 --> 01:12:49.535
because your wife
canceled her plans.

01:12:49.603 --> 01:12:53.972
It was just...
It was... humiliating.

01:12:54.708 --> 01:12:56.369
You lit candles?

01:12:56.810 --> 01:12:58.573
Shut up.

01:12:58.646 --> 01:13:02.275
Look, I've had
a pretty good life
these past 10 years.

01:13:02.349 --> 01:13:03.907
I have figured it out.

01:13:03.984 --> 01:13:08.148
I no longer feel
alone or divorced.
I just feel normal.

01:13:08.255 --> 01:13:12.385
You know how long it took me
to get that balance back?

01:13:14.061 --> 01:13:15.119
No.
No.

01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:18.830
Well, I'm going in
the wrong direction here.

01:13:18.932 --> 01:13:21.196
You know,
the worst part is,

01:13:21.268 --> 01:13:22.895
it feels like
it used to feel.

01:13:23.671 --> 01:13:26.731
All the little
untruths that...

01:13:26.807 --> 01:13:28.240
Hard to catch,
but they mount up.

01:13:28.309 --> 01:13:31.244
Janey, come on.
It was one mistake.

01:13:31.312 --> 01:13:32.336
No, it's...

01:13:32.413 --> 01:13:33.437
Everything okay out here?

01:13:35.349 --> 01:13:36.976
Kids are getting hungry.
Yeah.

01:13:37.918 --> 01:13:39.909
We're done.
We were just...

01:13:39.987 --> 01:13:42.421
Oh, Jane, it's none
of my beeswax, so...

01:13:43.290 --> 01:13:44.655
Please don't tell me.

01:13:44.725 --> 01:13:45.783
What's up?

01:13:46.193 --> 01:13:47.285
Nothing, punky.
Yeah?

01:13:47.361 --> 01:13:48.919
So we're gonna see
you tomorrow night
for sure, right?

01:13:48.996 --> 01:13:50.122
Absolutely.

01:13:51.498 --> 01:13:53.125
What did you see
and what do you know?

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:54.690
Nothing. Really.
Harley!

01:13:54.802 --> 01:13:56.099
Okay, he checked in,
then you arrived.

01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:57.831
Then you met at the elevator,
possible kiss there.

01:13:57.938 --> 01:13:59.462
Then the doctor went up
and the doctor came down.

01:13:59.540 --> 01:14:01.269
Then there was a thumbs-up,
but that's it.

01:14:01.342 --> 01:14:02.707
I have no idea what
happened in between.

01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:03.834
Have you told Lauren?

01:14:03.911 --> 01:14:05.139
No, and I won't.

01:14:05.212 --> 01:14:07.112
Hey, Mom. Dad's leaving.

01:14:10.117 --> 01:14:11.516
Looking good.
Oh, sorry. Wow.

01:14:11.585 --> 01:14:12.813
Yes, it's so good.

01:14:12.886 --> 01:14:14.683
Mom, it looks beautiful.
Thank you.

01:14:14.788 --> 01:14:15.846
Yes, it does.

01:14:15.923 --> 01:14:17.049
Hey, Dad,
thanks for picking me up.

01:14:17.124 --> 01:14:18.989
Yeah. Bye.

01:14:20.361 --> 01:14:21.385
...overdone it a little?

01:14:21.462 --> 01:14:22.554
Just a little bit!

01:14:59.032 --> 01:15:00.056
Yeah.

01:15:35.536 --> 01:15:36.560
Hey.

01:15:36.637 --> 01:15:38.070
Hey.

01:15:38.572 --> 01:15:39.698
You look fantastic.

01:15:39.773 --> 01:15:42.867
I'm feeling
a little fantastic.

01:15:45.546 --> 01:15:46.740
This is for you.

01:15:46.814 --> 01:15:48.873
Really? Thank you!

01:15:48.949 --> 01:15:52.077
Come on in.
Wow. That's so...

01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:56.112
Mmm. Will you
hold that for a sec?

01:15:57.791 --> 01:15:59.816
Oh, my God!

01:16:01.295 --> 01:16:04.458
Mmm. Mmm.

01:16:05.566 --> 01:16:08.592
Could be the best
cake I ever made.
You want a piece?

01:16:08.669 --> 01:16:09.795
It's beyond.

01:16:09.870 --> 01:16:10.962
I think I'm good.

01:16:11.138 --> 01:16:17.441
Okay. Can't believe
you brought me a gift.
So nice!

01:16:20.514 --> 01:16:21.572
An appointment book.

01:16:21.648 --> 01:16:23.445
I sort of assumed
you didn't have one.

01:16:24.117 --> 01:16:28.486
Because I never
remember our...

01:16:28.856 --> 01:16:29.914
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:16:30.424 --> 01:16:32.324
Oh!
I took the liberty
of marking

01:16:32.426 --> 01:16:34.326
our next two appointments
with Post-it notes.

01:16:34.394 --> 01:16:36.191
And I wrote the...
Wrote it in red.

01:16:36.263 --> 01:16:37.287
Mmm-hmm.

01:16:37.364 --> 01:16:39.093
And highlighted them
in neon yellow.

01:16:39.166 --> 01:16:40.929
Thank you.
Because I thought
that was a...

01:16:42.135 --> 01:16:43.193
Oh.

01:16:43.303 --> 01:16:44.702
I'm sorry.

01:16:45.539 --> 01:16:46.699
I'm not.

01:16:48.041 --> 01:16:49.474
Wow. That cake is good.

01:16:53.146 --> 01:16:54.170
I get it!

01:16:54.348 --> 01:16:56.009
So, let me
ask you a question.

01:16:56.116 --> 01:16:58.516
Please don't think
that I'm weird or
out of line or anything.

01:16:58.619 --> 01:17:02.111
But do you by any
chance poke smot?

01:17:02.189 --> 01:17:03.679
Do I... Do I what?

01:17:03.790 --> 01:17:06.554
I mean, do you smoke pot?

01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:07.684
Oh.

01:17:07.761 --> 01:17:09.126
I haven't asked
anyone that question

01:17:09.196 --> 01:17:10.356
since I was 22.

01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:12.091
Mmm, no, I don't.

01:17:12.165 --> 01:17:16.795
But I have. Uh, but I
don't think I've had any
since my kids were born,

01:17:16.870 --> 01:17:19.498
so not like in 27 years.

01:17:19.573 --> 01:17:22.167
Oh, my God!
Our kids are the same age.

01:17:22.242 --> 01:17:24.870
And I haven't had
any since my kids
were born either.

01:17:24.945 --> 01:17:26.276
Except for tonight.

01:17:26.346 --> 01:17:29.008
I had one hit from this!

01:17:30.551 --> 01:17:32.576
You might not wanna
hold that up quite so...

01:17:34.688 --> 01:17:38.988
I actually know him.
Blueberry scone
and a latte.

01:17:39.059 --> 01:17:41.550
Oh. Hi.

01:17:43.063 --> 01:17:44.087
Hi.

01:17:44.331 --> 01:17:46.492
Oh, my God.
That was horrifying.

01:17:46.567 --> 01:17:49.365
I instantly saw myself
in a mug shot.

01:17:49.436 --> 01:17:52.064
My heart is...
leaping out of my...

01:17:52.172 --> 01:17:56.108
Wow. That's the most
insane dashboard I ever saw.

01:17:56.577 --> 01:18:00.809
It's like
we're in a cockpit.
Spectacular!

01:18:00.881 --> 01:18:02.872
Adam, what kind
of car is this?

01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:04.474
Uh, Jane.

01:18:04.551 --> 01:18:05.609
Hi.

01:18:05.953 --> 01:18:08.251
Did you get this high
from one hit?

01:18:08.355 --> 01:18:14.294
Yes! I don't know
what they've done to pot
in the last 30 years,

01:18:14.528 --> 01:18:17.258
but it rocks!

01:18:27.574 --> 01:18:31.271
Just don't take too much,
because it's really strong.

01:18:41.321 --> 01:18:44.119
I haven't
had fun in almost
three years, Jane.

01:18:45.125 --> 01:18:48.891
Bring it on.

01:18:53.667 --> 01:18:54.998
Who's got the reefer?

01:18:55.102 --> 01:18:57.002
No one. Keep walking, please.

01:19:10.651 --> 01:19:11.948
How are you feeling?

01:19:12.019 --> 01:19:13.919
Totally fine.
Me, too.

01:19:16.623 --> 01:19:18.181
Hi!

01:19:18.925 --> 01:19:22.122
Oh! I love your dress!

01:19:22.195 --> 01:19:23.321
Hey, Harls.

01:19:23.397 --> 01:19:24.455
Harls? Uh-oh.

01:19:24.531 --> 01:19:26.829
Adam, this is my
oldest, Lauren.

01:19:26.933 --> 01:19:27.991
Hi.

01:19:28.068 --> 01:19:30.468
And her fiancÃ© Harley.

01:19:30.537 --> 01:19:31.765
Right.

01:19:31.838 --> 01:19:32.998
We're on a date.

01:19:51.458 --> 01:19:54.552
<i>The one good thing</i>

01:19:54.661 --> 01:19:57.186
<i>In my life</i>

01:19:57.297 --> 01:19:59.788
<i>Has gone away</i>

01:19:59.866 --> 01:20:02.357
<i>I don't know why</i>

01:20:03.370 --> 01:20:05.463
<i>She's gone away</i>

01:20:05.539 --> 01:20:07.973
<i>I don't know where</i>

01:20:09.209 --> 01:20:13.805
<i>Somewhere I can't
follow her</i>

01:20:16.583 --> 01:20:17.914
You got to come
meet them.

01:20:17.984 --> 01:20:19.076
I need to go.

01:20:19.152 --> 01:20:21.143
Hey, nice to
meet you. Bye.
Nice meeting you.

01:20:21.254 --> 01:20:22.482
We're gonna
get some drinks.

01:20:22.556 --> 01:20:23.716
It was really nice
to meet you.

01:20:24.524 --> 01:20:25.855
Bye.

01:20:25.926 --> 01:20:27.416
Adorable.

01:20:27.527 --> 01:20:28.585
Thanks.

01:20:28.662 --> 01:20:30.129
By the way,
how great is this party?

01:20:30.197 --> 01:20:32.188
It's great!
Let's be
the last to leave.

01:20:32.265 --> 01:20:34.199
Okay.
Oh!

01:20:35.402 --> 01:20:36.869
Hey, there's
your ex-husband.

01:20:36.937 --> 01:20:38.928
Uh-oh, and he's headed
right toward us.

01:20:39.039 --> 01:20:40.028
Oh, what?

01:20:40.107 --> 01:20:42.098
Not a great time to
be feeling groovy.

01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:49.510
Ooh, why so intense,
big fella?

01:20:49.583 --> 01:20:50.675
Hi.

01:20:52.219 --> 01:20:53.709
Hello, Jane.
Hi.

01:20:53.787 --> 01:20:54.845
Hey!

01:20:54.921 --> 01:20:55.945
Adam.

01:20:56.022 --> 01:20:58.217
Good to see you again.

01:20:58.291 --> 01:20:59.690
Hi.

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:02.422
Adam, this is Agness,
Jake's wife.

01:21:03.263 --> 01:21:04.753
Hi.
Hi.

01:21:04.865 --> 01:21:07.959
Ah! That's...
That's such
an odd sentence

01:21:08.068 --> 01:21:11.936
for me to say
since that was me
for most of my life.

01:21:12.038 --> 01:21:14.666
I mean, seriously.
How weird is that?

01:21:14.741 --> 01:21:16.470
Both of us married
to the same man!

01:21:16.543 --> 01:21:17.805
Hey. What are
you gonna do?

01:21:17.911 --> 01:21:19.776
Yeah. Why go there?

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:24.715
Because there...
it's fascinating!

01:21:25.085 --> 01:21:26.347
I mean,
if you think about it,

01:21:26.419 --> 01:21:28.944
it sort of links us
in a sort of cosmic,

01:21:29.055 --> 01:21:32.957
crazy way.
Doesn't it, Agness?

01:21:33.059 --> 01:21:34.822
I mean, of all the men
on the planet,

01:21:34.895 --> 01:21:36.385
we both said
"I do" to this guy!

01:21:36.463 --> 01:21:37.828
Oh, wow!

01:21:37.931 --> 01:21:40.126
Yeah, 25 years apart.

01:21:40.233 --> 01:21:43.225
I know you are having,
like, an aha moment,

01:21:43.303 --> 01:21:46.466
but I think
I'm gonna get a refill.
Adam, good meeting you.

01:21:46.573 --> 01:21:47.597
Great meeting you.

01:21:47.674 --> 01:21:48.732
Ah, ha-ha.

01:21:50.977 --> 01:21:52.274
Thank you.

01:21:52.345 --> 01:21:54.643
She has a really
scary tattoo.

01:21:56.316 --> 01:21:59.285
Janey, could I talk
to you for a quick sec?

01:22:01.454 --> 01:22:03.285
He always needs me
for a quick sec.

01:22:05.125 --> 01:22:06.956
Uh, are you okay?

01:22:07.027 --> 01:22:08.392
Oh, I'm very okay.

01:22:08.461 --> 01:22:11.089
What's going on?
You're acting insane.

01:22:11.164 --> 01:22:12.859
I'm stoned.

01:22:12.933 --> 01:22:14.093
What?

01:22:14.367 --> 01:22:15.698
You smoked that joint
I gave you?

01:22:15.802 --> 01:22:19.294
Yeah. You told me to.
It was amazing.

01:22:19.372 --> 01:22:20.703
Well, you weren't
supposed to smoke it
with him,

01:22:20.807 --> 01:22:22.365
you were supposed
to smoke it with me!

01:22:22.475 --> 01:22:24.670
Ooh, somebody's jealous.

01:22:24.778 --> 01:22:28.339
Well, yes, of course.
Why shouldn't I be?
You're my...

01:22:28.982 --> 01:22:32.213
What? What am I, Jake?

01:22:33.286 --> 01:22:36.187
You're my
ex-wife, lover...

01:22:36.289 --> 01:22:37.313
Hmm.

01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:39.085
...oldest friend,
girlfriend.

01:22:39.159 --> 01:22:43.391
Okay, you are hilarious.

01:22:43.496 --> 01:22:48.229
And because of that,
even though I kind of
hate youllove you,

01:22:48.335 --> 01:22:51.668
I'm gonna let you
have some of this.

01:22:51.738 --> 01:22:52.830
You love me?

01:22:52.906 --> 01:22:55.466
I mean, I heard "hate"
had top billing, but...

01:22:58.345 --> 01:23:02.213
Oh, my God.
Are you smoking weed
in the guest bathroom?

01:23:02.315 --> 01:23:03.475
Yes, we are.

01:23:03.550 --> 01:23:05.643
And we'd appreciate it
if you would not tell
anybody about this.

01:23:05.719 --> 01:23:08.244
No, never.
Just add it to the list.

01:23:08.588 --> 01:23:10.180
Care for a toke?
No.

01:23:10.257 --> 01:23:11.554
I don't smoke marijuana.

01:23:11.658 --> 01:23:13.216
Me neither.
Okay, one hit.

01:23:13.326 --> 01:23:14.486
Okay.
All right.

01:23:14.561 --> 01:23:16.188
Oh, my God!

01:23:17.898 --> 01:23:19.991
Is that what I look like?

01:23:20.834 --> 01:23:22.324
Oh, man!

01:23:37.183 --> 01:23:40.084
I love this. Turn it up.

01:24:05.645 --> 01:24:08.136
They must be hammered.

01:24:08.214 --> 01:24:09.306
Something like that.

01:24:19.225 --> 01:24:22.251
Sweetest divorced couple
in the world.

01:24:41.247 --> 01:24:43.306
Jake, I gotta go.

01:25:24.824 --> 01:25:25.848
Wow.

01:25:28.528 --> 01:25:30.894
Fun is
not overrated, is it?

01:25:33.033 --> 01:25:34.125
You know what's great?

01:25:34.200 --> 01:25:35.258
What?

01:25:36.870 --> 01:25:39.270
How much I like you.

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:41.064
Thank you.

01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:46.174
I really like you
a lot, too.

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:51.946
Even though...
Oh, you didn't say "a lot."

01:25:52.052 --> 01:25:53.781
I was thinking it.

01:25:56.890 --> 01:26:00.382
So, I'm not
too old for you?

01:26:02.295 --> 01:26:04.695
How can you be
too old for me when
I'm older than you?

01:26:04.764 --> 01:26:06.425
I just figured
that all the women

01:26:06.499 --> 01:26:09.024
you're fixed up
with are 35 or...

01:26:09.102 --> 01:26:13.630
Jane, your age is one
of my favorite things
about you.

01:26:17.644 --> 01:26:18.736
And...

01:26:20.613 --> 01:26:21.773
do you think...

01:26:22.949 --> 01:26:24.746
Do you think you
have any more of
that chocolate cake

01:26:24.818 --> 01:26:26.786
at your house?

01:26:26.886 --> 01:26:28.581
Hungry?
Starved.

01:26:38.932 --> 01:26:39.956
Oh, God.

01:26:42.168 --> 01:26:48.073
Oh. Officially now
the best date of my life,
pre- or post-divorce.

01:26:48.141 --> 01:26:49.802
Get out.

01:26:50.477 --> 01:26:54.777
Okay. So, basically,
I can make you
anything on the menu.

01:26:54.848 --> 01:26:55.906
No!

01:26:55.982 --> 01:26:57.574
Or even not on the menu.

01:26:57.650 --> 01:26:58.674
Really?

01:26:58.751 --> 01:27:00.082
Mmm-hmm. Just name it.

01:27:00.153 --> 01:27:02.178
Okay. Wow.

01:27:03.256 --> 01:27:08.353
Uh... Oh, what about a warm
chocolate croissant?

01:27:08.461 --> 01:27:10.452
Oh, it's my specialty.

01:27:15.335 --> 01:27:16.461
Okay.

01:28:18.331 --> 01:28:19.491
Here it goes.

01:28:19.566 --> 01:28:20.692
Oh, my God!

01:28:28.007 --> 01:28:30.202
Oh, baby.

01:28:32.378 --> 01:28:33.902
Hmm.

01:28:34.013 --> 01:28:36.413
It's crazy
how good this is.

01:28:36.783 --> 01:28:38.910
And I'm not even
stoned anymore.

01:28:39.519 --> 01:28:41.009
Neither am I.

01:28:41.354 --> 01:28:43.288
<i>Well, then,
merci, monsieur.</i>

01:28:47.026 --> 01:28:49.517
Do you remember
when I asked you
the other night

01:28:49.596 --> 01:28:52.588
if you were dating anyone,
and you said no.

01:28:53.233 --> 01:28:56.566
But it felt to me like
you were maybe saying yes.

01:28:58.571 --> 01:29:01.870
I was sort of
seeing someone.

01:29:02.976 --> 01:29:04.773
But it's over now.

01:29:06.946 --> 01:29:08.311
Honestly.

01:29:09.582 --> 01:29:13.746
Because I don't
wanna fall for someone
who's seeing someone else.

01:29:14.087 --> 01:29:16.817
I wouldn't be able
to take that again.

01:29:17.624 --> 01:29:19.114
I understand.

01:29:21.628 --> 01:29:25.564
I wouldn't say
it was over unless...
Unless it was.

01:29:26.466 --> 01:29:27.660
Great.

01:29:33.406 --> 01:29:35.431
Oh, it's a cooking scar.

01:29:36.142 --> 01:29:38.667
Big batch
of hot caramel.

01:29:38.778 --> 01:29:40.609
And what about this one?

01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:44.081
Oh, that was boiling sugar.

01:29:44.651 --> 01:29:47.745
Yeah,
I wasn't very skilled
in the beginning.

01:29:53.026 --> 01:29:57.793
That is a...
From a large French

01:30:02.468 --> 01:30:03.867
sautÃ© pan.

01:30:05.204 --> 01:30:06.398
Would it be
all right if I...

01:30:06.472 --> 01:30:07.598
Mmm-hmm.

01:30:12.211 --> 01:30:14.202
I was going
to say "kiss you."

01:30:14.314 --> 01:30:15.713
I figured.

01:30:16.616 --> 01:30:20.017
And if you feel this
is in any way wrong
because we're working...

01:30:20.119 --> 01:30:21.381
I don't.

01:30:29.262 --> 01:30:30.251
I don't.

01:30:46.312 --> 01:30:48.405
Hey, sleepy.

01:30:48.715 --> 01:30:49.739
Hi.

01:30:49.816 --> 01:30:51.147
What time did you get in?

01:30:51.217 --> 01:30:54.380
I have no idea.
Lauren and Harley
drove me home.

01:30:54.487 --> 01:30:56.216
I'm surprised
you remember that.

01:30:56.322 --> 01:30:58.984
Hi! I didn't know
you slept over.

01:30:59.058 --> 01:31:00.650
We were playing
Scattergories with Gabby,

01:31:00.727 --> 01:31:02.251
and Harley fell asleep
on the couch.

01:31:02.362 --> 01:31:04.193
Oh, sweet!

01:31:05.832 --> 01:31:07.527
I got cold in the middle
of the night.

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:09.227
Wow.

01:31:11.504 --> 01:31:14.496
Okay, who's hungry?
Who wants what?

01:31:15.441 --> 01:31:16.465
Hey, baby.

01:31:16.542 --> 01:31:19.204
Hi. What is Dad doing here?

01:31:35.795 --> 01:31:37.524
Everything okay?

01:31:38.731 --> 01:31:40.198
I left Agness.

01:31:40.266 --> 01:31:42.928
No. Don't say that.

01:31:43.035 --> 01:31:44.127
Janey, she saw it
in my eyes.

01:31:44.203 --> 01:31:45.295
Saw what?

01:31:45.405 --> 01:31:47.270
That I'm still
in love with you.

01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:51.071
I admitted it,
told her all about us,
and I've left her.

01:31:51.244 --> 01:31:52.268
For you.

01:31:52.345 --> 01:31:53.334
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:31:53.413 --> 01:31:56.075
What do you mean?
This is crazy, Jake!

01:31:56.149 --> 01:31:58.310
Are you telling me
the truth?

01:31:58.384 --> 01:31:59.942
This feels so right, Jane.

01:32:00.753 --> 01:32:02.448
What's going on?

01:32:03.956 --> 01:32:05.446
Go set the table.
I'll be right in.

01:32:05.525 --> 01:32:08.426
Uh, Mom, nobody cares
if the table's set
except for you.

01:32:08.494 --> 01:32:11.054
Okay, then do it for me.
Just go in. Please?

01:32:11.130 --> 01:32:12.222
What's up, Dad?

01:32:12.298 --> 01:32:14.129
Uh, just having
some problems
on the home front.

01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:16.998
I wanted to talk to
your mom for a sec.

01:32:17.136 --> 01:32:19.536
Uh, problems on
the home front?

01:32:22.542 --> 01:32:24.339
Is one of you
seeing someone else?

01:32:24.410 --> 01:32:26.435
Oh, no. No.

01:32:26.512 --> 01:32:30.278
Nothing like that.
I just, uh, need
a hotel or something

01:32:30.349 --> 01:32:33.443
for a few days,
till I get my
head together.

01:32:33.519 --> 01:32:35.316
It's that serious?

01:32:35.721 --> 01:32:36.813
Mom, can Dad stay here
for a few days?

01:32:36.889 --> 01:32:37.913
No.

01:32:37.990 --> 01:32:39.321
He can share my room.

01:32:39.392 --> 01:32:42.828
You know, I don't think
that's the best idea, Luke.

01:32:43.463 --> 01:32:46.523
Daddy. Are you crying?

01:32:50.636 --> 01:32:52.536
I'm sorry.

01:32:58.411 --> 01:32:59.537
Mom!

01:33:12.225 --> 01:33:15.854
Mommy is the best cook
in the world.

01:33:27.773 --> 01:33:29.900
Think about
what he's doing.

01:33:30.009 --> 01:33:33.172
He's nuts. Mmm.

01:33:35.748 --> 01:33:37.375
Thank you for
saving me, Janey.

01:33:37.450 --> 01:33:39.042
Jake.

01:33:39.385 --> 01:33:40.818
You knew all
the kids were here.

01:33:40.887 --> 01:33:42.286
Shouldn't we have
talked about this?

01:33:42.388 --> 01:33:43.855
Agreed that it was
the right thing to do?

01:33:43.923 --> 01:33:44.981
I'm sorry.

01:33:45.057 --> 01:33:46.854
No, no.
This is just so typical.

01:33:46.926 --> 01:33:48.860
Only thinking about
what works for you.

01:33:48.928 --> 01:33:51.226
I guess I should have
called before showing up.

01:33:51.297 --> 01:33:54.391
And I'm not sure
you left Agness.

01:33:54.467 --> 01:33:57.959
Maybe
she saw something
and threw you out.

01:33:58.971 --> 01:34:01.701
What's the difference?
I was drowning over there.

01:34:01.774 --> 01:34:03.935
I'm not gonna get
that many more chances

01:34:04.043 --> 01:34:06.034
to figure myself out.
Yeah.

01:34:06.112 --> 01:34:08.546
Janey, let's use
these couple of days

01:34:08.614 --> 01:34:09.808
to see if we can
make this work!

01:34:09.882 --> 01:34:11.042
No. We can't, Jake.

01:34:11.117 --> 01:34:12.948
I told you this
the other night.
But...

01:34:13.052 --> 01:34:14.246
No, you...
Please listen to me. You...

01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:16.788
You were pissy
because you thought
I stood you up.

01:34:16.889 --> 01:34:19.380
Things are different now.
I'm a free man!

01:34:22.061 --> 01:34:23.756
Can we just hug?

01:34:24.497 --> 01:34:26.362
I hate that you're
being so distant.

01:34:26.432 --> 01:34:29.765
It's literally giving me
a pain in my stomach.

01:34:29.835 --> 01:34:32.463
Oh, God. Come here.

01:34:36.142 --> 01:34:38.576
You okay?
No. See? Too much.

01:34:38.644 --> 01:34:40.305
Okay. Good note.

01:34:42.148 --> 01:34:45.606
Uh, can I help you with
what you're doing?

01:34:45.685 --> 01:34:48.153
Maybe hold your basket?

01:34:49.355 --> 01:34:50.652
I'm fine.

01:34:50.756 --> 01:34:52.121
Okay, I'm going to
go to the video store

01:34:52.191 --> 01:34:53.715
and get us a DVD
we can watch tonight.

01:34:53.793 --> 01:34:55.351
Mmm-hmm.
We'll have movie night,
like old times.

01:34:55.461 --> 01:34:58.294
How's that?
I'll make the popcorn.
 Oh, God!

01:34:58.364 --> 01:34:59.524
Fine.

01:35:01.767 --> 01:35:02.756
Hello?

01:35:02.835 --> 01:35:05.133
I love knowing that
I'm coming back here.

01:35:06.772 --> 01:35:10.139
Hi! Oh.

01:35:10.643 --> 01:35:13.669
Yeah, I slept great.
How about you?

01:35:16.182 --> 01:35:19.481
Um. Oh!

01:35:21.654 --> 01:35:24.179
I know. It was.

01:35:24.557 --> 01:35:26.525
It was, I know.

01:35:37.103 --> 01:35:38.661
Thanks, Daddy.

01:35:42.141 --> 01:35:43.608
<i>Can I help you, sir?</i>

01:35:43.676 --> 01:35:46.440
<i>What?
Oh, no. I'm just...</i>

01:35:46.712 --> 01:35:48.202
<i>Are you here
for an affair, sir?</i>

01:35:49.682 --> 01:35:50.842
<i>What?</i>

01:35:50.916 --> 01:35:52.008
<i>The Singleman party, sir?</i>

01:35:52.118 --> 01:35:54.484
<i>Oh, yes.
The Singleman party.</i>

01:35:54.854 --> 01:35:56.048
<i>It's in
the main ballroom.</i>

01:35:56.122 --> 01:35:58.056
<i>Ah, thank you.</i>

01:35:58.124 --> 01:36:00.183
I'm so happy.

01:36:04.730 --> 01:36:05.992
I never have food
in my apartment.

01:36:06.065 --> 01:36:07.965
I know.
I don't either.

01:36:08.034 --> 01:36:09.160
Oh,
get the mashed potato.

01:36:09.235 --> 01:36:10.293
Yum!

01:36:10.369 --> 01:36:11.427
Why are we still hungry?

01:36:11.504 --> 01:36:12.528
I don't know.

01:36:12.638 --> 01:36:14.162
- It's...
- Oh!

01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:15.264
Any leftovers?

01:36:15.341 --> 01:36:16.330
Uh, are you kidding?

01:36:16.409 --> 01:36:18.809
Any of that
noodle thing left?

01:36:20.212 --> 01:36:24.171
Oh! Where's your mom?
She disappeared so fast
after the movie.

01:36:24.250 --> 01:36:25.808
She's probably sleeping.

01:36:25.885 --> 01:36:28.251
I think she's
on her computer.

01:36:29.221 --> 01:36:31.121
Tonight was weird.

01:36:31.190 --> 01:36:33.021
So weird. Still is.

01:36:33.559 --> 01:36:34.617
I loved tonight.

01:36:34.694 --> 01:36:36.423
Yeah. That's why
it's so weird.

01:36:36.495 --> 01:36:39.020
Just to see you in
your robe in our kitchen.

01:36:39.098 --> 01:36:40.497
Remember when you
weren't even allowed in?

01:36:40.566 --> 01:36:42.727
Mom used to go out to
the car to talk to you.

01:36:42.835 --> 01:36:46.931
You know, I don't even
really remember you
and Mom as a couple.

01:36:47.373 --> 01:36:50.342
What do you mean?
You were 10 when
we broke up.

01:36:50.409 --> 01:36:52.240
I was 12, actually.

01:36:52.344 --> 01:36:56.007
And I don't know,
it's just...
It's all foggy to me now.

01:36:56.082 --> 01:36:58.050
You don't
remember us in Hawaii

01:36:58.117 --> 01:37:00.415
or all of us sleeping
together in that tent
in the backyard?

01:37:00.519 --> 01:37:03.750
Yeah, of course.
I just...
I don't remember, like,

01:37:04.223 --> 01:37:08.182
you and Mom hugging
or waking up together.

01:37:09.395 --> 01:37:10.521
Luke.

01:37:10.596 --> 01:37:12.461
It's okay.
I'm not damaged or anything.

01:37:12.565 --> 01:37:16.899
Dude, speak for yourself.
I am definitely damaged
from this divorce.

01:37:17.136 --> 01:37:18.433
Hello, troops.

01:37:18.504 --> 01:37:19.766
Why are you still here?

01:37:19.872 --> 01:37:23.364
I don't know.
You and Mom sleeping
in the same house?

01:37:23.909 --> 01:37:26.241
Harley thought
we should stay.

01:37:26.946 --> 01:37:28.777
She exaggerates.
I just thought, perhaps,

01:37:28.848 --> 01:37:30.611
you might want
to talk later or...

01:37:30.716 --> 01:37:32.308
Is that the noodle thing?

01:37:34.754 --> 01:37:37.348
Oh, I'm sorry.
I think I ate it all.

01:37:37.423 --> 01:37:38.549
Dad!

01:37:38.624 --> 01:37:39.955
I didn't know
anyone wanted it.

01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:44.791
Back up. Back up.
A little bit back,
so I can see. Oh!

01:37:46.065 --> 01:37:47.123
Very festive.

01:37:47.199 --> 01:37:48.461
<i>Okay, thanks.</i>

01:37:48.801 --> 01:37:50.462
It was gift from
my ex-sister-in-law.

01:37:50.536 --> 01:37:53.505
I have no idea
why I kept it.
Into the pile.

01:37:53.572 --> 01:37:55.631
Hey, Jane,
take a look at the pile.

01:37:55.741 --> 01:37:57.971
Yeah. Nice!

01:37:58.077 --> 01:37:59.942
Ah! The pile's moving.

01:38:00.012 --> 01:38:01.502
Murphy, get out of there.

01:38:03.749 --> 01:38:05.717
<i>When I was in India
I had this made,</i>

01:38:05.785 --> 01:38:06.843
<i>but the guy ran
out of fabric,</i>

01:38:07.319 --> 01:38:10.254
so he didn't give
me long sleeves,
or short sleeves.

01:38:10.322 --> 01:38:11.653
It's weird.

01:38:11.724 --> 01:38:12.986
<i>Uh, and kind of girly.</i>

01:38:13.325 --> 01:38:14.656
Not what I should
be going for.

01:38:15.628 --> 01:38:18.188
<i>How about this?
Gray sweater, very old.</i>

01:38:18.297 --> 01:38:19.924
Oh. But cute.

01:38:19.999 --> 01:38:21.364
<i>You're sure? Now you
don't have to say that</i>

01:38:21.467 --> 01:38:23.128
just because you nixed
the last 20 things.

01:38:23.202 --> 01:38:25.432
No. You have to
keep that. It's cozy.

01:38:25.504 --> 01:38:27.301
You are helping me
so much, by the way.

01:38:27.373 --> 01:38:29.102
Okay, Adam, I feel like...
I gotta pee.

01:38:29.175 --> 01:38:32.372
Oh, good. Me, too.
I'll meet you back in 30.

01:38:32.478 --> 01:38:34.070
I'm putting you on the desk.

01:38:34.146 --> 01:38:35.738
<i>I'm not in there.</i>

01:38:35.915 --> 01:38:37.507
Can't hear you!

01:39:27.633 --> 01:39:28.930
No! Mother of... Whoa!

01:39:29.001 --> 01:39:30.059
What?

01:39:30.135 --> 01:39:31.898
What are you
doing in here?
I wanted to see you.

01:39:32.004 --> 01:39:33.699
Get it off!
Why are you naked?

01:39:33.806 --> 01:39:34.795
Why do you think?

01:39:34.874 --> 01:39:35.932
Oh! I'm gonna be sick!

01:39:36.008 --> 01:39:38.841
Not working! Big close-up!

01:39:40.512 --> 01:39:42.343
<i>Oh, the other side.</i>

01:39:42.548 --> 01:39:43.572
No, no, no! No!

01:39:43.649 --> 01:39:45.913
No! Okay!

01:39:57.429 --> 01:40:00.296
Mom! Everybody okay?

01:40:02.268 --> 01:40:04.031
What's happening?

01:40:04.436 --> 01:40:07.530
Okay. Just let me explain.

01:40:09.041 --> 01:40:11.532
The reason
that I left Agness
was not just because

01:40:11.610 --> 01:40:13.976
my marriage
wasn't working.

01:40:14.313 --> 01:40:17.771
I've also fallen in love...

01:40:18.450 --> 01:40:22.477
Back in love
with your mother.

01:40:25.090 --> 01:40:28.059
Maybe, I never
stopped loving her.

01:40:29.762 --> 01:40:31.389
Is this a joke?

01:40:32.498 --> 01:40:34.659
I know it's shocking,

01:40:34.767 --> 01:40:38.168
but I think this
is the best thing that's
ever happened to me.

01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:41.603
Your mother and I
have been seeing each other
ever since New York.

01:40:41.674 --> 01:40:43.904
Mom,
is this true?

01:40:44.476 --> 01:40:46.774
That part is, but...

01:40:46.845 --> 01:40:48.745
I found my way home.

01:40:50.449 --> 01:40:52.610
<i>I hope she'll take me back.</i>

01:40:59.625 --> 01:41:03.959
Why is everyone crying?
Why isn't this good news?

01:41:05.264 --> 01:41:08.256
Because we're still
getting over the divorce.

01:41:08.334 --> 01:41:10.302
Oh!
Mom,

01:41:10.369 --> 01:41:13.167
are you and Dad
getting back together?

01:41:17.376 --> 01:41:18.604
No.

01:41:21.213 --> 01:41:22.646
We're not.

01:42:05.024 --> 01:42:06.389
Lauren...

01:43:20.933 --> 01:43:23.094
No! What...

01:43:47.359 --> 01:43:48.917
Glad you're here, boss.

01:43:54.433 --> 01:43:57.163
Now, Jane,
I know you don't need
my advice, but...

01:43:57.269 --> 01:43:59.635
I got this one.

01:43:59.705 --> 01:44:02.037
Yeah. Yeah,
I know you do.

01:44:24.296 --> 01:44:28.733
Knowing how to be divorced
is next to impossible.

01:44:30.202 --> 01:44:32.670
And sometimes,
over the years,

01:44:32.738 --> 01:44:37.004
I have thought
that your dad and I
weren't quite finished.

01:44:38.510 --> 01:44:41.479
And as it
turns out, we weren't.

01:44:42.814 --> 01:44:44.975
So, I went out of
my comfort zone,

01:44:45.050 --> 01:44:48.019
which I found out if
you're really honest
with yourself,

01:44:48.086 --> 01:44:50.316
isn't all that comforting.

01:44:50.722 --> 01:44:53.384
And I experimented
with a part of myself

01:44:53.492 --> 01:44:56.154
because I wanted to know
if after all these years

01:44:56.228 --> 01:45:00.187
there was still something
there between us.

01:45:00.832 --> 01:45:02.390
And was there?

01:45:02.901 --> 01:45:05.062
Mmm,
there kind of was. Yeah.

01:45:05.704 --> 01:45:07.968
But, Mom,
you have to understand

01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:10.270
how bonkers
this sounds to us.

01:45:10.375 --> 01:45:11.364
Mmm.

01:45:11.443 --> 01:45:12.842
For two people,

01:45:12.911 --> 01:45:16.369
who for years couldn't be
in the same room together,

01:45:16.448 --> 01:45:18.439
to then have an affair.

01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:21.713
I know. It was hard
for me and I was doing it.

01:45:22.454 --> 01:45:27.517
I hope you'll forgive me
for confusing you.

01:45:29.294 --> 01:45:31.421
And betraying your trust.

01:45:32.698 --> 01:45:35.132
But, I did this for me.

01:45:35.968 --> 01:45:37.902
And I did it for him.

01:45:38.303 --> 01:45:40.931
And I realize
that even though
your dad and I

01:45:41.006 --> 01:45:44.442
once had
something extraordinary,

01:45:45.477 --> 01:45:50.210
now we no longer really

01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:53.474
fit together.

01:45:56.822 --> 01:46:00.223
But he is a part of me.
He always will be.

01:46:00.659 --> 01:46:04.755
So, it's over now?
You guys are back
to being divorced?

01:46:06.131 --> 01:46:07.462
Mmm-hmm.

01:46:10.702 --> 01:46:12.761
For better or for worse.

01:46:18.143 --> 01:46:19.542
Come here.

01:46:20.712 --> 01:46:22.077
My littles...

01:46:22.147 --> 01:46:23.978
Okay, I'm coming in.

01:46:25.917 --> 01:46:27.248
Oh!

01:46:34.726 --> 01:46:36.717
So, did you
get the elevations?

01:46:36.795 --> 01:46:38.729
Yup,
we like them, too.

01:46:39.331 --> 01:46:43.165
Uh-huh.
Yeah. No, we can
definitely do that.

01:46:43.235 --> 01:46:46.432
And I can have more
for you by mid week.

01:46:49.541 --> 01:46:52.874
Sean, uh, can
I call you right back?
Someone just...

01:46:52.944 --> 01:46:54.468
Thanks.

01:46:56.915 --> 01:46:58.246
Hi.
Hi.

01:46:59.418 --> 01:47:00.442
May I come in?

01:47:00.519 --> 01:47:01.508
Uh, sure.

01:47:10.962 --> 01:47:14.193
I didn't call you last night
because I wasn't sure
you'd take the call.

01:47:15.634 --> 01:47:17.329
And then I thought
that could go on
for months.

01:47:17.436 --> 01:47:19.529
I would've taken the call.

01:47:19.705 --> 01:47:22.868
Oh! Okay. Well...

01:47:24.209 --> 01:47:26.973
Anyway, it's better
to say these things
in person, Adam.

01:47:27.045 --> 01:47:28.876
The man that
I was seeing...

01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:31.676
I think I'm up to
speed on that part.

01:47:33.051 --> 01:47:36.612
Yeah.
Anyway, I want you to know
it didn't last long.

01:47:37.489 --> 01:47:39.218
You're divorced. I mean,

01:47:39.324 --> 01:47:41.622
maybe you can understand
when a marriage ends

01:47:41.693 --> 01:47:45.629
there's doubts and hurt
and when you have kids,
you just...

01:47:45.697 --> 01:47:48.165
Sometimes you wonder
if you did the right thing,

01:47:48.233 --> 01:47:50.633
and the moment
presents itself and...

01:47:50.702 --> 01:47:53.967
I get it. I could
imagine it. I could.

01:47:55.407 --> 01:47:58.740
And I told him
that it wasn't going
to work out between us,

01:47:58.844 --> 01:48:02.678
but I guess he didn't
hear me or believe me.

01:48:04.483 --> 01:48:07.247
And, uh, unbeknownst to me,
he showed up at
my house yesterday

01:48:07.352 --> 01:48:08.876
and he has left Agness.

01:48:08.987 --> 01:48:12.320
Jane, I actually
think I understand
what happened.

01:48:13.859 --> 01:48:17.989
But, you know, um,
I'm not as macho
as I appear.

01:48:18.363 --> 01:48:22.322
And I think it's
probably best for us

01:48:22.401 --> 01:48:24.369
if we don't get
any more involved.

01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:30.398
Because your
relationship with Jake
isn't really done.

01:48:30.942 --> 01:48:32.466
And I know
you're saying it is,

01:48:32.544 --> 01:48:35.342
but he's still
in love with you.

01:48:36.615 --> 01:48:40.949
And for everyone's sake,
I think that should
probably get resolved.

01:48:44.523 --> 01:48:48.050
Wow. So that's how
grownups talk.

01:48:51.396 --> 01:48:53.796
Please don't tell me that
you're going to quit my job

01:48:53.899 --> 01:48:56.299
and ask Peter
to take over now.

01:48:56.468 --> 01:48:59.460
'Cause then I'll never
get to see you. And...

01:48:59.571 --> 01:49:03.530
Um... I was thinking
of asking Peter
to step back in.

01:49:07.479 --> 01:49:09.242
I hope you don't.

01:49:10.649 --> 01:49:11.946
Thanks.

01:50:13.111 --> 01:50:14.510
I'm sorry.

01:50:19.618 --> 01:50:22.052
How far back
does that sorry go?

01:50:22.487 --> 01:50:24.478
How far back do
you need it to go?

01:50:24.556 --> 01:50:26.023
Way back.

01:50:27.526 --> 01:50:30.290
Consider it an
all-inclusive apology.

01:50:30.962 --> 01:50:35.990
From not being
the husband you needed

01:50:37.202 --> 01:50:40.000
to showing up nude on
your bed last night.

01:50:40.071 --> 01:50:41.299
Yeah.

01:50:43.241 --> 01:50:47.007
What were you
thinking with that move?

01:50:47.913 --> 01:50:50.245
That you would
find me irresistible.

01:50:50.348 --> 01:50:51.372
Mmm-hmm.

01:50:51.449 --> 01:50:53.747
I never considered
the alternative.

01:50:53.852 --> 01:50:56.047
Got to love that
about you.

01:50:56.855 --> 01:50:58.152
Oh, man.

01:50:59.691 --> 01:51:04.060
I can't believe
I got up to bat again
and blew it.

01:51:04.429 --> 01:51:06.260
You didn't blow it.

01:51:08.199 --> 01:51:09.666
We blew it.

01:51:10.835 --> 01:51:13.360
We blew it
the first time around.

01:51:14.105 --> 01:51:17.074
This time we just
should've known better.

01:51:18.376 --> 01:51:22.745
Too much time has passed.
Too much has happened.

01:51:24.716 --> 01:51:27.708
And you don't think
we could make it right?

01:51:29.554 --> 01:51:33.217
Does that mean
you thought it didn't
feel right either?

01:51:33.792 --> 01:51:37.421
Being with you, Jane,
is the best I'm going to be.

01:51:37.796 --> 01:51:40.230
But do you agree it...

01:51:41.199 --> 01:51:42.223
It wasn't really...

01:51:42.300 --> 01:51:44.097
It was complicated.

01:51:45.136 --> 01:51:46.467
Begging for an answer.

01:51:46.571 --> 01:51:48.539
I thought it was good.

01:51:49.374 --> 01:51:51.365
I wanted it to be good.

01:51:52.577 --> 01:51:55.307
Well, it's as close
as I'm going to get,
I guess.

01:51:55.413 --> 01:51:58.075
Do you
always have to be
so hard on me?

01:52:02.220 --> 01:52:05.986
No, I don't.

01:52:13.064 --> 01:52:15.828
I don't regret
giving it another shot.

01:52:18.236 --> 01:52:20.830
Probably would've
been better if you
hadn't been married.

01:52:22.607 --> 01:52:25.440
It may never have happened
if I wasn't married.

01:52:29.648 --> 01:52:30.979
Yeah.

01:52:43.528 --> 01:52:45.655
I don't regret it either.

01:53:44.823 --> 01:53:46.120
Good morning.

01:53:46.191 --> 01:53:47.249
Good morning.

01:53:48.426 --> 01:53:51.862
Did you know
it's good luck to start
building in the rain?

01:53:51.930 --> 01:53:53.056
Really?
Oh, yeah.

01:53:53.164 --> 01:53:56.395
It's a well-known,
very good,
really lucky omen.

01:53:59.104 --> 01:54:01.595
Good. I can use one.

01:54:04.509 --> 01:54:07.069
Would you all like to have
your meeting inside?

01:54:07.178 --> 01:54:09.544
It's dry and I have
hot coffee.

01:54:17.222 --> 01:54:20.623
Jane, I need
to ask you something.

01:54:24.562 --> 01:54:26.223
You don't happen
to have any of those

01:54:26.297 --> 01:54:28.822
amazing chocolate croissants,
do you?

01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:31.391
Oh,
you like those, huh?

01:54:31.469 --> 01:54:33.767
I do have incredibly
fond memories of them.

01:54:33.838 --> 01:54:36.398
Oh, well,
I don't have any here,

01:54:36.474 --> 01:54:38.533
but we could go
into town and get some,
