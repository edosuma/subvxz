00:30.233 --> 00:32.232
You're almost there.
Don't push.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.499
You're the closest.
Don't push yet, don't push.

00:35.500 --> 00:37.232
You're almost there though.

00:37.233 --> 00:41.033
Don't push. Breathe.
Just breathe. It's almost over.

00:42.767 --> 00:44.499
You're not quite there.

00:44.500 --> 00:47.200
You have a little while.
You're not there. Calm, calm.

00:50.333 --> 00:51.333
You're almost there.

00:53.100 --> 00:55.633
Breathe.
You're close, just breathe.

00:58.767 --> 00:59.767
I can't!

01:00.400 --> 01:02.200
I can see the head.

01:07.333 --> 01:09.532
Sweetheart, look at me.
One last push!

01:11.600 --> 01:14.600
That's it. It's here! It's here.

01:16.333 --> 01:17.333
My baby!

01:18.567 --> 01:21.100
- Your son is here, Natalie.
- Oh, my God!

01:21.633 --> 01:23.033
He's so beautiful!

01:26.833 --> 01:28.432
It's almost time.

01:32.433 --> 01:35.332
Push! You're fully dilated.

01:35.333 --> 01:38.232
Push! Push it now!

01:38.233 --> 01:39.432
Again!

01:40.667 --> 01:42.733
Hold still, you can do this!

01:43.433 --> 01:46.267
- You're fully dilated. Push!
- I know!

01:46.667 --> 01:47.732
All right. I'm gonna help you.

01:47.733 --> 01:49.466
This is gonna hurt
for one moment.

01:49.467 --> 01:50.533
Get it out!

01:51.333 --> 01:53.566
- What're you trying do to?
- I'm gonna do it for you!

01:53.567 --> 01:54.567
Push!

01:55.833 --> 01:57.732
- I hate you!
- It's coming.

01:57.733 --> 02:01.000
- I hate you!
- The head is coming out. Push!

02:03.600 --> 02:05.299
It's coming.

02:07.133 --> 02:09.433
You did it. The baby!

02:11.400 --> 02:15.333
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Push!
- What?

02:18.433 --> 02:19.433
Second's in...

02:26.700 --> 02:28.667
- You have twins.
- What?

02:29.300 --> 02:30.633
You had two babies.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.767
- Hold your baby, Staci.
- I don't want to see it.

02:40.833 --> 02:44.267
- Hold your baby, Staci.
- No! No!

03:13.233 --> 03:18.567
Dr. Wise, I'm in so much pain
that I'm nauseous!

03:22.400 --> 03:24.033
The girls are so peaceful!

03:25.567 --> 03:28.600
Oh, why does it hurts so much?
Something's wrong!

03:30.233 --> 03:32.067
These babies have been
such a curse.

03:41.367 --> 03:42.400
It's impossible.

03:46.333 --> 03:49.567
- Impossible.
- What? What's impossible?

03:54.533 --> 03:55.567
It can't be.

04:03.133 --> 04:04.167
You're...

04:07.333 --> 04:08.333
You're pregnant.

04:11.433 --> 04:16.433
No! No, it can't be.
That's impossible. It can't be.

04:19.333 --> 04:21.333
Oh, yes. It can be.

04:23.300 --> 04:24.333
When you're in hell.

04:31.200 --> 04:35.133
I died on the operating table
at the abortion clinic.

04:37.533 --> 04:39.133
I committed suicide.

04:42.400 --> 04:47.500
Welcome to your eternity,
Dr. Wise, Staci.

04:48.633 --> 04:51.400
Prepare for another nine months.

05:07.767 --> 05:08.767
Well?

05:13.467 --> 05:14.599
You're the foreman.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.699
It's up to you
to get things moving.

05:16.700 --> 05:18.200
Okay, I'll do a count.

05:18.600 --> 05:21.832
Uh... You guys good with hands,
show of hands?

05:21.833 --> 05:23.033
- Sure.
- Why not?

05:24.367 --> 05:25.832
- Shall I write this on a pad?
- Yeah.

05:25.833 --> 05:27.599
Look,
we all know they're guilty.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.232
They kidnapped the girl.

05:29.233 --> 05:31.332
So, let's just vote
and get this over with.

05:31.333 --> 05:32.799
All right, fine.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.533
Raise your hands
if you say guilty.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.000
Okay, that's 11 for guilty.
Not guilty?

05:47.367 --> 05:49.399
Not guilty? Are you serious?

05:49.400 --> 05:50.666
I can't deal with this today.

05:50.667 --> 05:53.066
I've got a major business
dinner at seven.

05:53.067 --> 05:55.166
It's pretty clear
to the rest of us.

05:55.167 --> 05:57.033
Did everyone really
think this through?

05:57.700 --> 06:00.599
Or are you just deciding
based on emotion?

06:00.600 --> 06:03.432
What's to think through?
We have confessions!

06:03.433 --> 06:05.666
That's a luxury
in most criminal cases.

06:05.667 --> 06:07.266
Not only confessions,

06:07.267 --> 06:10.266
but we have a video tape
of the actual crime.

06:10.267 --> 06:12.366
For seven months,
24 hours a day,

06:12.367 --> 06:13.766
they filmed themselves.

06:13.767 --> 06:15.666
Which jury gets
that kind of evidence?

06:15.667 --> 06:18.133
I thought through this case
during the entire trial.

06:18.567 --> 06:20.132
All the while watching

06:20.133 --> 06:22.466
the hours of footage
of their crime,

06:22.467 --> 06:24.566
and listening to
their testimony.

06:24.567 --> 06:26.599
I don't need to
think about it anymore.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.099
Oh, what's there to think
about, really?

06:28.100 --> 06:29.600
I mean, the law is the law.

06:30.267 --> 06:32.266
We had plenty of time
to think about this

06:32.267 --> 06:35.200
and we're all in agreement.
Except you.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.667
- Why is it so cold in here?
- Yeah, it's freezing.

06:38.600 --> 06:40.566
Thank God I wore this sweater.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.799
Can we call somebody
to come fix the heat?

06:42.800 --> 06:45.266
Our tax dollars at work, right?
You know, you'd think

06:45.267 --> 06:46.599
that the government
could at least afford

06:46.600 --> 06:48.732
to heat their own buildings.

06:48.733 --> 06:49.733
I'll take a look.

06:50.767 --> 06:52.132
Look, I'll call a bailiff

06:52.133 --> 06:53.732
and have him call maintenance,
all right?

06:53.733 --> 06:56.232
Let's just get back
to the vote, people.

06:56.233 --> 06:57.399
Let's hope we're out
of here soon.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.467
It won't even matter.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.666
Well, we don't have
a unanimous decision yet,

07:01.667 --> 07:04.166
so, looks like
we're not going anywhere.

07:04.167 --> 07:05.333
Look, everyone.

07:06.567 --> 07:08.466
I'm not saying that you didn't
think about what you heard.

07:08.467 --> 07:10.500
I'm just raising
the logical question.

07:11.467 --> 07:13.832
Are you saying guilty
out of emotion?

07:13.833 --> 07:16.466
Or because you truly believe
legally

07:16.467 --> 07:19.099
and morally
that they are guilty?

07:19.100 --> 07:20.199
All right,
let's just think about

07:20.200 --> 07:23.199
this thing for a minute, okay?
Let's talk this out.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.399
Does anyone have
anything to say?

07:25.400 --> 07:28.199
Honey, why don't you just tell
us what you're thinking,

07:28.200 --> 07:30.099
so we... So we all understand?

07:30.100 --> 07:32.299
Yeah, maybe we can help you
out of your confusion,

07:32.300 --> 07:34.666
and you can realize
that they are guilty.

07:34.667 --> 07:36.666
Since we've had
our minds made up,

07:36.667 --> 07:39.200
why don't we try to explain
to her our thought processes?

07:39.633 --> 07:42.333
We are in majority.
We have to convince her.

07:43.167 --> 07:45.532
It's a good idea.
Why don't we go around the table

07:45.533 --> 07:47.200
and see
what everyone has to say?

07:48.267 --> 07:49.467
Anybody want to start?

07:51.333 --> 07:52.600
We might as well go in order.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.299
No, I'm the foreman,
so, I'll go last,

07:56.300 --> 07:58.300
but you are number two,
why don't you start?

08:00.200 --> 08:02.266
You know,
there's a reason courtrooms

08:02.267 --> 08:05.033
have that justice statue
with a blindfold, right?

08:05.467 --> 08:07.699
It's because justice
is based on facts

08:07.700 --> 08:10.000
and the facts are,
they are guilty.

08:10.467 --> 08:12.500
We have videotape
and confessions.

08:13.700 --> 08:14.767
What more do you want?

08:15.733 --> 08:17.732
I know what the facts are,

08:17.733 --> 08:20.400
and I know how it looks to
the people in this room,

08:20.833 --> 08:23.166
but I am saying that they are
not guilty

08:23.167 --> 08:25.200
because I believe
the law says so.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.500
Maybe they were justified?

08:29.333 --> 08:30.699
What, now you're with her?

08:30.700 --> 08:32.400
I'm just asking a question.

08:33.366 --> 08:35.500
You saw Staci's two children,
the twins, testify.

08:36.500 --> 08:37.799
They'd be dead if Dr. Wise

08:37.799 --> 08:39.799
and the others
didn't kidnap Staci.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.366
Not born.

08:41.366 --> 08:43.332
- Huh?
- They're not dead.

08:43.332 --> 08:46.133
They're just not yet born.
There's a huge difference.

08:46.567 --> 08:47.600
Are you crazy?

08:48.600 --> 08:51.232
Staci Horowitz wanted to
have an abortion

08:51.233 --> 08:52.499
two months into her pregnancy,

08:52.500 --> 08:55.166
and she had
a legal right to do so.

08:55.167 --> 08:56.499
And these maniacs kidnapped her,

08:56.500 --> 08:57.366
making her stay in a place

08:57.367 --> 08:59.400
that was probably colder
than in here.

09:00.200 --> 09:03.466
For seven months,
they incarcerated her,

09:03.467 --> 09:05.599
and they played mind games
with the poor girl.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.499
Christ! They even tried to
make her think

09:07.500 --> 09:09.333
she was in hell
after she gave birth!

09:10.433 --> 09:12.732
Come on, you two.
Get your senses together.

09:12.733 --> 09:14.299
You can't hold us up here.

09:14.300 --> 09:16.566
It's like you're kidnapping
us right now.

09:16.567 --> 09:18.332
I just asked a question,
all right?

09:18.333 --> 09:20.133
I'm not holding anything up.

09:20.633 --> 09:23.232
He made a good point about
just how purposeful

09:23.233 --> 09:24.432
and plotting these people were.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.673
Those are the kind of things
the prosecutor talked about.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.432
They planned
the kidnapping form months.

09:29.433 --> 09:31.233
They rehearsed and rehearsed.

09:32.067 --> 09:33.567
Tried to manipulate
Ms. Horowitz.

09:34.267 --> 09:36.166
There's tons of footage.

09:36.167 --> 09:37.599
You should be able
to find something

09:37.600 --> 09:39.466
that shows plotting
and manipulation.

09:39.467 --> 09:41.332
I'm one step ahead of you.

09:41.333 --> 09:42.799
I didn't say that they didn't
plan it out.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.132
- I'm just saying we should...
- Here.

09:45.133 --> 09:46.133
Watch this again.

09:53.600 --> 09:57.300
No, no, no, no!

10:11.333 --> 10:13.567
You were all
on the operating table.

10:15.267 --> 10:17.267
All ready to commit murder.

10:19.300 --> 10:23.067
And now, your babies
will be given life,

10:23.467 --> 10:25.133
just as God planned.

10:29.533 --> 10:32.267
You're nuts.
You kidnapped us!

10:34.067 --> 10:36.233
Lara,
the strongest of the three.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.400
Strong has nothing to do
with my anger.

10:41.533 --> 10:45.000
You violated my most precious
of constitutional rights!

10:45.467 --> 10:48.667
What about the child's rights?
God's rights?

10:50.700 --> 10:52.200
Please, stop the craziness.

10:54.133 --> 10:57.567
Maybe, she's right.
What about the child's rights?

10:58.333 --> 11:00.233
I was pressured into this
by Brandon.

11:01.667 --> 11:03.832
I appreciate the support,
Natalie,

11:03.833 --> 11:05.600
but you shouldn't slam Brandon.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.200
You're an adult woman.
You made the choice.

11:11.233 --> 11:12.300
Come here, child.

11:20.067 --> 11:22.167
You decided to kill your baby.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.300
Brandon couldn't make you,
could he?

11:27.600 --> 11:30.200
Don't be weak, Natalie.
This is a cult.

11:32.167 --> 11:35.199
Fanatics! You're a
throwback to 50 years ago

11:35.200 --> 11:37.066
with all this
radical Christianity!

11:37.067 --> 11:39.300
Your goal is to discriminate
against women.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.467
I am a woman.

11:42.233 --> 11:44.399
Don't use your femininity
as a crutch.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.399
You stand for nothing
about gender equality,

11:46.400 --> 11:49.200
when you want to take away
our most basic freedom.

11:50.067 --> 11:53.300
Looks as if I was wrong,
Staci is the strongest.

11:54.333 --> 11:57.132
I don't care about
who's the strongest,

11:57.133 --> 12:00.532
and I don't care about
this stupid political debate!

12:00.533 --> 12:03.200
I'm gonna get to the point.
What do you want from us?

12:04.233 --> 12:06.033
Lara, the typical lawyer.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.700
What do you want from us?

12:11.600 --> 12:12.667
Not want...

12:18.833 --> 12:21.633
demand. You will stay here,

12:22.233 --> 12:25.466
in this room,
for the next seven months,

12:25.467 --> 12:29.500
until you all simultaneously
give birth to your children.

12:31.500 --> 12:34.367
I... I still can't believe that
she was part of the kidnapping.

12:34.833 --> 12:38.000
- Who? Dr. Wise or Lara Foley?
- Lara Foley.

12:38.467 --> 12:40.233
She just seemed so authentic.

12:40.733 --> 12:42.267
Yeah, so did Natalie.

12:43.400 --> 12:46.399
Hey! They all confessed.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.733
They're right wing nuts.
They're like terrorists.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.432
Instead of training with
machine guns and bombs,

12:51.433 --> 12:53.199
they trained in acting.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.532
They spent months getting
into their characters,

12:55.533 --> 12:58.233
and going over some "loose
script", as they called it.

12:59.433 --> 13:02.100
But there was so much that
couldn't have been scripted.

13:02.733 --> 13:04.432
In fact, most of it.

13:04.433 --> 13:06.200
It was a general idea, get it?

13:08.267 --> 13:10.300
I can take out that
silly church doctor.

13:12.633 --> 13:15.200
Lara? Lara?

13:18.633 --> 13:21.300
The three of us can easily
eliminate her.

13:22.333 --> 13:24.600
You don't know what's
behind that door or who.

13:26.400 --> 13:29.199
There could be no one.
There probably is no one.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.733
All we've seen is that woman,
and the suit on the TV.

13:33.833 --> 13:35.600
And what if there are
more out there?

13:38.200 --> 13:40.533
Don't you get it?
They're not gonna hurt us.

13:41.467 --> 13:44.133
They can't hurt us because
they won't hurt the babies.

13:49.333 --> 13:52.767
She is a scared little girl,
but you and I are women.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.600
Come on.

13:55.367 --> 13:58.300
I'm scared too
and what if that fence is real?

14:01.067 --> 14:02.167
I'll try to cross it.

14:04.533 --> 14:09.566
Look, I know you're frightened,

14:09.567 --> 14:13.099
terrified and I know that you
feel guilty about the abortion,

14:13.100 --> 14:15.400
but you're just buying into
their propaganda.

14:15.833 --> 14:17.599
They're brainwashing us.

14:17.600 --> 14:21.232
I really do think that what
I was about to do was wrong.

14:21.233 --> 14:23.133
You weren't doing
anything wrong!

14:23.833 --> 14:28.332
Let's say we eliminate Dr. Wise

14:28.333 --> 14:30.332
and there's no one else here
with her.

14:30.333 --> 14:31.333
Then we're home free.

14:32.800 --> 14:36.432
Maybe, maybe there's
a phone or computer

14:36.433 --> 14:37.799
and we can contact help.

14:37.800 --> 14:41.099
- Yeah.
- But maybe not.

14:41.100 --> 14:43.432
And you try to run into
the snow, desert,

14:43.433 --> 14:45.233
wilderness,
wherever the hell we are,

14:46.667 --> 14:47.667
and you pass out.

14:48.667 --> 14:51.567
Natalie and I can't help you
for the same reason.

14:52.467 --> 14:55.099
We can't help you because
we'd pass out trying.

14:55.100 --> 14:58.067
Yes, and then you'll die in
the snow and so will your baby.

14:58.800 --> 15:00.133
My baby?

15:01.267 --> 15:05.266
I don't have a baby,
you stupid little girl!

15:05.267 --> 15:06.266
I don't have
anything inside of me

15:06.267 --> 15:08.799
I that even remotely resembles
a human being!

15:08.800 --> 15:10.600
And neither do you,
nor does Lara!

15:11.767 --> 15:14.000
Staci, I agree with you.

15:14.533 --> 15:16.667
There's gonna be a lot of
brainwashing going on here.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.266
I got to say I'm pretty impressed
with the performances.

15:21.267 --> 15:24.432
I mean, these girls definitely
seem like kidnap victims to me.

15:24.433 --> 15:27.066
But they weren't!
We've got confessions, remember?

15:27.067 --> 15:28.599
And they all testified,

15:28.600 --> 15:32.466
right in front of us at trial
admitting their damn atrocities.

15:32.467 --> 15:36.033
Calm down, man. You don't act
to the foreman that way.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.567
I just want to understand what
we're wasting time here for.

15:40.167 --> 15:41.467
They're all obviously guilty.

15:42.300 --> 15:46.066
Robert Lation,
Dr. Victoria Wise, Lara Foley,

15:46.067 --> 15:48.266
and that young girl,
Natalie Fields.

15:48.267 --> 15:51.567
All guilty of kidnapping
Staci Horowitz.

15:52.200 --> 15:54.299
I don't see
how anyone can disagree.

15:54.300 --> 15:56.599
It's the most open and
shut case I've ever seen.

15:56.600 --> 15:57.799
You're correct.

15:57.800 --> 15:59.132
They've told the police
they kidnapped her

15:59.133 --> 16:00.466
and they've told us.

16:00.467 --> 16:02.699
And they had surveillance
cameras up 24/7

16:02.700 --> 16:07.066
for the entire seven months,
so, we can see the entire show.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.832
I don't have seven months
to watch the whole show, okay?

16:09.833 --> 16:11.466
I think we saw enough
of it at trial.

16:11.467 --> 16:13.600
It's not a show.
It's a kidnapping.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.467
It's a terrible crime against
that poor woman.

16:17.700 --> 16:20.732
You're right, of course.
It was no Broadway play.

16:20.733 --> 16:22.566
Look, I attended for a year

16:22.567 --> 16:24.366
at a law school
before I changed my mind

16:24.367 --> 16:25.633
and went to medical school.

16:26.633 --> 16:28.466
Criminal law 101 says

16:28.467 --> 16:31.467
that we have to look for
mens rea. The intent.

16:33.167 --> 16:35.567
They all had the intent to
commit this crime.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.699
So, it's up to us
to convict them.

16:38.700 --> 16:41.367
You are all talking about their
intent and their planning.

16:42.367 --> 16:44.267
Look at why they planned this.

16:45.200 --> 16:47.066
Their purpose
was to prevent Staci

16:47.067 --> 16:48.167
from aborting her children.

16:48.700 --> 16:50.732
Roe V. Wade has not
been reversed.

16:50.733 --> 16:53.000
She has the right to have
an abortion. It's still legal.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.832
Are you saying it's okay
to commit crimes

16:56.833 --> 16:59.367
to keep people from doing things
you don't agree with?

17:00.400 --> 17:03.799
Imagine our society
if everybody acted that way.

17:03.800 --> 17:06.531
Whoa, whoa, hold on a second.
Do you have kids?

17:06.532 --> 17:08.400
Yes. Why?

17:09.099 --> 17:11.199
Wouldn't you do
anything you could

17:11.200 --> 17:13.699
to stop somebody trying to
hurt your kids?

17:13.700 --> 17:16.199
I mean, even if it meant
risking getting arrested

17:16.200 --> 17:18.000
and getting charged with
assault or something?

17:18.800 --> 17:21.531
I would, no question.
Who wouldn't?

17:21.532 --> 17:24.398
So, how does that make
these defendants justified?

17:24.400 --> 17:26.799
Wait a minute,
there is a huge difference here.

17:26.800 --> 17:29.066
I love my kids and I would
do anything for them,

17:29.067 --> 17:32.067
but they are actually in
this world. They are alive.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.566
When she was kidnapped,
Staci Horowitz's children,

17:34.567 --> 17:36.566
they were not even born yet.

17:36.567 --> 17:39.266
Yeah, you're saying it's okay
to commit crimes

17:39.267 --> 17:41.432
to protect people
that don't exist?

17:41.433 --> 17:43.000
What do you mean, "don't exist"?

17:43.800 --> 17:47.066
Her children were very much
alive inside her womb.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.566
You're telling me
that you consider them

17:48.567 --> 17:50.432
children at that point?

17:50.433 --> 17:54.200
They... They were fetuses,
masses of cells.

17:55.067 --> 17:56.466
At two months,
they weren't even developed.

17:56.467 --> 17:57.466
They're not even human

17:57.467 --> 18:00.500
That's incorrect.
They were quite developed.

18:01.467 --> 18:04.066
By the time Staci realized she
was pregnant,

18:04.067 --> 18:05.667
her children's brains
were developing.

18:06.400 --> 18:08.066
By the time she was kidnapped,

18:08.067 --> 18:10.199
the babies had arms and legs,

18:10.200 --> 18:13.000
and fingers and looked like
actual babies.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.332
But really,
it doesn't even matter

18:15.333 --> 18:17.100
what they look like
at that point.

18:17.667 --> 18:20.667
From the moment of conception,
they were human lives.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.466
Lives worth saving.

18:23.467 --> 18:27.400
No, no, they weren't.
They were basically tissue.

18:28.133 --> 18:30.466
No, no,
you're incorrect about that.

18:30.467 --> 18:32.633
They were definitely lives
at the point of conception.

18:33.300 --> 18:36.199
They were alive.
No one can argue that.

18:36.200 --> 18:40.066
Alive, lives, yes.
But not human beings.

18:40.067 --> 18:42.500
Hold on,
he just made a good point.

18:43.433 --> 18:47.333
The fetuses are lives. What are
they if they're not human lives?

18:48.300 --> 18:50.666
- Not lions or tigers or bears.
- Oh, my!

18:52.167 --> 18:54.333
- It's not just a big joke.
- Thanks, man

18:55.267 --> 18:56.667
I think we should take
another vote.

18:57.167 --> 18:58.500
Shouldn't the foreman
decide that?

19:00.500 --> 19:03.199
Well, I think anyone
can call for a vote.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.532
This is getting more ridiculous
by the second.

19:05.533 --> 19:08.300
We're gonna be stuck
in this freezing room all night.

19:09.700 --> 19:11.199
Did anyone ever call the bailiff

19:11.200 --> 19:12.499
so we can get
maintenance in here?

19:12.500 --> 19:14.732
No. Because this juror
has kept us

19:14.733 --> 19:16.532
locked in her baseless dialog,

19:16.533 --> 19:18.832
while everyone knows that each
and everyone

19:18.833 --> 19:20.832
of these defendants are guilty.

19:20.833 --> 19:22.300
I called for a vote.

19:23.733 --> 19:25.533
All right, let's take a vote.

19:26.700 --> 19:30.167
Can we do this by secret ballot?
So, no one feels intimidated?

19:31.200 --> 19:32.200
I don't see why not.

19:34.567 --> 19:37.467
Here, why don't you rip this
to pieces so we can vote.

19:38.367 --> 19:39.367
Good idea.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.232
This damn thing
is stuck on 58 degrees.

19:47.233 --> 19:49.232
The levers won't move
no matter how hard I try.

19:49.233 --> 19:51.132
Hey, hey, don't break it.

19:51.133 --> 19:53.599
They probably'll make us
pay for it if we break it.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.700
Why don't you come here and vote
and then we'll call the bailiff.

19:59.800 --> 20:00.800
Thank you.

20:07.467 --> 20:09.167
Someone just pass it on to him.

20:12.100 --> 20:15.066
- Now, take it easy, guys.
- It's cold in here.

20:15.067 --> 20:16.200
Just hurry it up.

20:18.133 --> 20:20.167
- All right, is that everybody?
- Yeah.

20:22.233 --> 20:23.233
Guilty.

20:25.567 --> 20:26.567
Guilty.

20:27.633 --> 20:28.633
Guilty.

20:29.567 --> 20:30.567
Guilty.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.300
- Not guilty.
- Well, there's your vote.

20:40.500 --> 20:41.832
- Not guilty.
- What?

20:41.833 --> 20:43.832
I'm never gonna make it
to my meeting.

20:43.833 --> 20:46.232
Excuse me, I don't care
about your meeting.

20:46.233 --> 20:47.832
I want to hear
the rest of the results.

20:47.833 --> 20:51.500
Whatever! We know whose vote
that was anyway, don't we?

20:54.233 --> 20:55.233
Guilty.

20:57.700 --> 20:58.700
Guilty.

21:02.567 --> 21:03.567
Guilty.

21:08.467 --> 21:09.467
Not guilty.

21:12.500 --> 21:16.000
That's nine guilty
and three not guilty.

21:16.433 --> 21:18.399
Who's the third not guilty?

21:18.400 --> 21:20.599
You? The one who's suddenly
trying to tell us

21:20.600 --> 21:22.399
that fetuses are human lives?

21:22.400 --> 21:25.499
We didn't know who the second
vote was, much less the third.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.632
This was a secret ballot,
remember?

21:27.633 --> 21:31.332
Wrong! We know exactly who the
second not guilty vote is.

21:31.333 --> 21:34.099
Oh, excuse me! I don't like you
standing over me like that.

21:34.100 --> 21:36.466
I don't appreciate
your know-it-all attitude.

21:36.467 --> 21:38.499
So, you're denying
you voted not guilty?

21:38.500 --> 21:41.066
All right, I'm gonna have to
intercede here as the foreman.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.599
Oh, hurray, hurray!

21:42.600 --> 21:45.299
You're finally doing your job!

21:45.300 --> 21:47.399
Now, could you please
try to convince

21:47.400 --> 21:49.066
these imbeciles to do
what's right?

21:49.067 --> 21:50.699
Hey, you, tough guy.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.466
I'm starting to get
a little sick of you.

21:52.467 --> 21:53.699
And you too, for that matter.

21:53.700 --> 21:56.666
You don't call anyone in here
imbeciles or any other names

21:56.667 --> 21:58.099
just because
they disagree with you.

21:58.100 --> 21:59.799
Yeah, okay, whatever.
Why don't you sit down?

21:59.800 --> 22:02.299
Turn around and be a man!
Look at me!

22:02.300 --> 22:05.132
Hey, stop fighting! Fighting
is not gonna solve anything.

22:05.133 --> 22:06.500
All right, that's enough!

22:07.200 --> 22:09.767
Okay, now, we need to have
some type of order in here.

22:10.467 --> 22:13.799
And that's my job as the
foreman, is to keep the order.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.633
Not to change people's opinions.

22:18.467 --> 22:21.733
Well, guess what?
Knock, knock. Who's there?

22:23.300 --> 22:25.733
- I'm the third not guilty.
- Oh, my God!

22:26.167 --> 22:27.767
You! Why?

22:33.267 --> 22:34.500
I just thought about my kid

22:35.700 --> 22:38.767
and my kid not being alive
and that thought's unbearable.

22:40.533 --> 22:43.132
Look, if my wife tried
to have an abortion,

22:43.133 --> 22:44.532
I'd hire someone to kidnap her

22:44.533 --> 22:47.433
if I was thinking about this
in some retrospective way.

22:49.267 --> 22:52.200
I just can't imagine my daughter
not being alive.

22:52.767 --> 22:56.699
But kidnapping is not permitted
by law.

22:56.700 --> 22:59.199
I don't know if it is
or isn't permitted.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.067
I don't care. Not guilty.

23:01.633 --> 23:04.367
Oh, my gosh!
Do you see what you've started?

23:05.133 --> 23:07.100
People don't care about
following the law now.

23:07.533 --> 23:10.733
Well, isn't that what should be
the focus here? The law?

23:11.667 --> 23:13.266
I believe you're talking about

23:13.267 --> 23:15.233
what you perceive
to be the law of God.

23:16.267 --> 23:17.267
Maybe.

23:19.267 --> 23:22.600
Remember the expert report in
the charts on fetal development?

23:23.567 --> 23:26.067
And the way the babies looked
after they were aborted?

23:27.400 --> 23:29.500
Aborted at all different stages
of life.

23:30.333 --> 23:31.600
With their heads crushed,

23:32.233 --> 23:34.733
and their tiny little arms
and legs dismembered.

23:36.100 --> 23:38.267
That's a bloody mess
of human body parts.

23:41.133 --> 23:42.766
Perhaps we should have someone
bring in the photographs

23:42.767 --> 23:44.499
and the charts
so we can go over them?

23:44.500 --> 23:46.432
No! Oh, Christ!

23:46.433 --> 23:48.733
We remember. We don't
need to go over it again.

23:50.600 --> 23:52.232
Would anyone like to see them?

23:52.233 --> 23:54.599
I think we can just talk it out.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.433
Discuss the medicine and
the biology of the fetuses.

23:58.367 --> 24:01.067
Just discuss it, right?

24:02.233 --> 24:04.133
When the fetus
is about an inch big,

24:05.233 --> 24:07.300
that's when most abortions
take place.

24:08.233 --> 24:09.733
Do you consider that
a human life?

24:10.400 --> 24:14.567
They are human lives from the
moment of conception. Period.

24:16.467 --> 24:20.333
When a sperm fertilizes an egg,
it creates unique DNA.

24:21.300 --> 24:24.100
And that is the blueprint
for a unique human being.

24:24.767 --> 24:27.599
The original cell that's
created is a human being

24:27.600 --> 24:29.399
already male or female father.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.433
With genes from the mother
and father.

24:32.600 --> 24:34.767
From that point on,
it's a matter of development.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.266
So,
at any point after conception,

24:38.267 --> 24:41.300
if that human life is harmed,
a crime is being committed

24:42.100 --> 24:44.632
Your passion equals
your ignorance.

24:44.633 --> 24:46.333
And that isn't name calling.

24:46.800 --> 24:49.433
I'm just trying to educate you,
young lady.

24:50.467 --> 24:54.099
Simply, it's not a human life
at conception

24:54.100 --> 24:56.400
nor for sometime afterward.

24:57.533 --> 25:02.566
It's as I stated before,
just a mass of cells.

25:02.567 --> 25:06.499
In layman's term,
it can't see, it can't touch,

25:06.500 --> 25:09.200
it can't walk,
and it can't think.

25:10.067 --> 25:11.632
Do you consider that
a human being?

25:11.633 --> 25:13.533
It's just aggregation of cells.

25:14.567 --> 25:17.767
So what if it's one cell?
It's alive, isn't it?

25:18.667 --> 25:22.132
It has the DNA for a human,
not a horse,

25:22.133 --> 25:24.333
or a fish, or monkey, right?

25:24.767 --> 25:25.932
So, it's a human life.

25:25.933 --> 25:29.033
I would not consider that
the point where life begins.

25:29.433 --> 25:31.600
Well, then, where is the point
where life begins?

25:32.333 --> 25:36.400
- You're asking me?
- I'm asking anyone or everyone.

25:37.167 --> 25:39.832
You know, they talked about this
in the videos.

25:39.833 --> 25:41.132
Let's go back
to the footage first

25:41.133 --> 25:42.367
so I can see what they said.

25:44.167 --> 25:45.832
They were watching
the guys on TV

25:45.833 --> 25:48.700
and that one guy was eating
deviled eggs and talking.

25:49.333 --> 25:50.799
While he is looking for
the right DVD,

25:50.800 --> 25:52.766
can someone please
call the maintenance guy?

25:52.767 --> 25:54.199
It's freezing in here.

25:54.200 --> 25:55.599
My teeth are chattering

25:55.600 --> 25:57.480
and I haven't even finished
paying for them yet.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.399
Damn!

26:01.400 --> 26:04.566
I just have the judge's
extension which is 1225.

26:04.567 --> 26:07.300
So, ready to admit you are
the other not guilty vote?

26:08.133 --> 26:09.300
It was a secret ballot.

26:11.267 --> 26:12.399
You know what?

26:12.400 --> 26:16.500
Here's something public for you.
I'm changing my vote.

26:17.700 --> 26:19.533
I'm not guilty.

26:20.300 --> 26:21.399
This is just unbelievable!

26:21.400 --> 26:22.599
What?

26:22.600 --> 26:27.066
This is just unbelievable!
Staci Horowitz was kidnapped.

26:27.067 --> 26:28.666
She was taken from her family
and her friends

26:28.667 --> 26:31.332
and her life for seven months.

26:31.333 --> 26:34.033
Look, she can change her vote
if she wants. It's her right.

26:35.133 --> 26:39.000
Exactly, but let's just be
on track here, please.

26:39.533 --> 26:41.599
It is our duty and our right

26:41.600 --> 26:44.199
to convince each other
to follow the law.

26:44.200 --> 26:47.699
And I think if we discuss this
under the scope of the law,

26:47.700 --> 26:50.600
maybe we can bring these fallen
angels back on the right side.

26:51.233 --> 26:56.067
Okay, our fallen angels are now
juror number seven, of course.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.133
Uh, six.

26:59.633 --> 27:02.132
Two and...

27:02.133 --> 27:03.933
So, we're not doing
the secret ballot anymore?

27:04.633 --> 27:05.633
Apparently not.

27:07.767 --> 27:10.399
All right, I was the fourth
not guilty vote.

27:10.400 --> 27:12.299
- I knew it.
- Number ten.

27:12.300 --> 27:14.300
Okay, so let's get into
some of this logic.

27:15.300 --> 27:17.399
This has the actual discussion

27:17.400 --> 27:20.533
about when a fetus becomes a
human life. Let's take a look.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.299
Well, exactly what relevance
does this make

27:25.300 --> 27:27.366
that the defendant can legally

27:27.367 --> 27:29.367
keep Staci Horowitz
against her will?

27:30.533 --> 27:33.433
It means everything. Legally.

27:35.200 --> 27:39.432
Obviously,
abortion at any time is evil.

27:39.433 --> 27:41.600
Obviously, but what do you care?

27:43.267 --> 27:44.267
I don't.

27:45.333 --> 27:47.573
But I have to have good answers
to smart position points.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.267
Okay. Let's work though one.

27:52.667 --> 27:57.399
Sure. I'll be the pro-life
goody two-shoes

27:57.400 --> 28:00.432
and you can be the pro-choice
self-interested baby-killer.

28:00.433 --> 28:01.632
Splendid.

28:01.633 --> 28:05.366
And I'll play it like I'm a
thoughtful pro-choice person

28:05.367 --> 28:09.499
who has a clear line drawn on
when abortion should be legal.

28:09.500 --> 28:10.632
All right.

28:10.633 --> 28:15.199
Would you murder a baby
one minute after it was born?

28:15.200 --> 28:16.332
Of course not.

28:16.333 --> 28:18.266
One second after it was born?

28:18.267 --> 28:20.733
No. How could I?
It's a human baby.

28:21.433 --> 28:26.232
But you would abort a baby
one second before it was born.

28:26.233 --> 28:29.332
Because at that point, it's
not a human life yet, right?

28:29.333 --> 28:32.166
- No, I couldn't.
- A minute before it was born?

28:32.167 --> 28:33.799
- No.
- One day before birth?

28:33.800 --> 28:35.232
- Come on.
- A week?

28:35.233 --> 28:36.399
Ten days before?

28:36.400 --> 28:38.199
No, it's human being
at that point.

28:38.200 --> 28:41.199
One month before
the baby is born?

28:41.200 --> 28:43.066
You would surely kill it then?

28:43.067 --> 28:44.232
Well...

28:44.233 --> 28:46.467
Is it 45 days
before the baby is born?

28:47.733 --> 28:49.599
Two months before
the baby's born?

28:49.600 --> 28:51.732
When does this mass of cells

28:51.733 --> 28:54.367
magically transform
into a human being?

28:55.600 --> 28:58.667
- Three months.
- Okay. At three months,

28:59.800 --> 29:02.299
the fetus is
magically transformed

29:02.300 --> 29:04.633
into a human being.
One day before that?

29:05.267 --> 29:08.399
It was worthless.
Worthy to have its skull crushed

29:08.400 --> 29:11.232
and sucked from the mother's
body by a vacuum.

29:11.233 --> 29:14.066
One day before and
everything magically changes?

29:17.467 --> 29:18.467
Well?

29:20.333 --> 29:21.666
Well, probably most of us
wouldn't agree

29:21.667 --> 29:23.432
with an abortion
when it is close to the end,

29:23.433 --> 29:25.199
but I think it's open to
interpretation

29:25.200 --> 29:27.166
about when it's
considered a baby.

29:27.167 --> 29:29.666
I think when it can actually
live on its own.

29:29.667 --> 29:32.566
You obviously didn't listen to
the experts during the trial.

29:32.567 --> 29:35.299
Because if you had,
you'd know that that theory

29:35.300 --> 29:38.399
is always changing based on
advances in medicine.

29:38.400 --> 29:41.633
In 1973,
when Roe V. Wade was decided,

29:42.267 --> 29:43.799
a baby couldn't
live outside the mother

29:43.800 --> 29:46.166
any earlier than six months.

29:46.167 --> 29:50.200
So, in 1973, five month old
fetuses weren't human beings.

29:50.667 --> 29:54.266
Therefore, abortionists could
just blast their brains

29:54.267 --> 29:56.499
to smithereens
and kill them like a house fly.

29:56.500 --> 29:58.799
But today,
since the babies can survive

29:58.800 --> 30:01.066
outside the womb at five months,

30:01.067 --> 30:02.507
they're all of a sudden
human beings.

30:03.633 --> 30:07.799
That doesn't make any sense.
They were always human beings.

30:07.800 --> 30:11.132
There's got to be something in
the law we can use as guidance.

30:11.133 --> 30:13.499
Does anyone actually know what
the law states about that?

30:13.500 --> 30:15.566
Oh, remember,
we can ask the judge questions,

30:15.567 --> 30:17.266
so, why don't we just do that?

30:17.267 --> 30:19.333
Sure,
let's just waste more time.

30:20.333 --> 30:22.532
Yeah,
we have nothing better to do.

30:22.533 --> 30:25.600
Don't be rude. I think we should
definitely call the judge.

30:28.067 --> 30:29.266
While you are at it,

30:29.267 --> 30:31.499
can you ask him about the
freezing temperatures in here?

30:31.500 --> 30:33.099
I spoke to the secretary.

30:33.100 --> 30:35.020
She said a maintenance worker
would be here soon.

30:36.200 --> 30:37.200
Hello?

30:39.133 --> 30:40.332
Uh, yes, it's the foreman in the

30:40.333 --> 30:42.666
Robert Lation, Victoria Wise
and Lara...

30:42.667 --> 30:45.766
- The abortion case?
- Yeah, yeah, the abortion case.

30:45.767 --> 30:48.232
Okay, so, how can I help you?

30:48.233 --> 30:50.132
Well, we got a question
here for the judge.

30:50.133 --> 30:52.100
Sure, what is it?
I'll pass it on to him.

30:52.500 --> 30:55.567
Is there any law that says
what constitutes a human life?

30:56.800 --> 30:59.799
I mean, like, if there's a baby,
a fet...

31:00.833 --> 31:03.799
If there's something growing
inside of a woman?

31:03.800 --> 31:05.332
Sounds like a
well thought out question.

31:05.333 --> 31:06.799
I'll ask Judge Solomon.

31:09.500 --> 31:11.267
"Something that's growing
inside of a woman"?

31:13.567 --> 31:15.299
Let's just be honest here.

31:15.300 --> 31:17.600
It's a human life
no matter what you try to argue.

31:18.733 --> 31:21.700
It's not matter of opinion.
It's scientific fact.

31:22.500 --> 31:24.333
Let's revisit the charts
on fetal development.

31:26.567 --> 31:28.232
Hello, jury members.

31:28.233 --> 31:30.366
Oh, well, this isn't
usual judicial protocol.

31:30.367 --> 31:32.699
I've decided to stop by and
answer your question personally.

31:32.700 --> 31:34.732
Usually, the bailiff just,
you know,

31:34.733 --> 31:37.100
brings me notes,
I send those back, but,

31:37.800 --> 31:40.467
well, I'm a regular guy,
just like all of you, so,

31:41.533 --> 31:43.699
why not answer your questions
in person?

31:43.700 --> 31:46.532
I'd just be sitting in my office
reading some boring legal text

31:46.533 --> 31:48.532
or...

31:48.533 --> 31:50.832
...watching
The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

31:50.833 --> 31:53.066
That's a good movie.

31:53.067 --> 31:57.000
So, to answer your question, if
a person shoots a pregnant woman

31:57.467 --> 31:59.500
in the stomach,
or the face for that matter,

32:00.533 --> 32:04.233
and the baby, or the fetus
dies along with her...

32:06.200 --> 32:09.400
that person is guilty
of a double homicide.

32:14.733 --> 32:17.766
But is the fetus considered
a human life under the law?

32:17.767 --> 32:20.000
And we're still freezing
in here, Your Honor!

32:21.100 --> 32:22.566
The fact that the unborn child

32:22.567 --> 32:25.099
is taken into consideration
in a case like this

32:25.100 --> 32:27.266
means that the fetus is indeed

32:27.267 --> 32:30.232
considered a human being
according to the law.

32:30.233 --> 32:32.132
You know, I think I'm gonna
change my vote.

32:32.133 --> 32:34.699
What? Just like that?
Without examining the law?

32:34.700 --> 32:36.632
No, not just like that.

32:36.633 --> 32:39.232
That video that
Dr. Wise had Staci watch,

32:39.233 --> 32:41.299
it made a whole lot of sense.

32:41.300 --> 32:42.632
Nobody can say
the point at which

32:42.633 --> 32:45.533
a fetus magically transforms
into a human being.

32:46.300 --> 32:50.199
Is it an hour before birth?
A week? A month?

32:50.200 --> 32:52.099
Three months? Who knows?

32:52.100 --> 32:53.732
They're just way too much risk

32:53.733 --> 32:55.333
that we're killing
a human being.

32:56.233 --> 32:58.132
And like the judge said,

32:58.133 --> 33:00.633
if a pregnant woman is murdered,
the fetus dies,

33:01.300 --> 33:02.832
that constitutes
a double homicide

33:02.833 --> 33:04.632
and I think based on that

33:04.633 --> 33:08.667
the law dictates that the fetus
does constitute human life.

33:09.467 --> 33:13.133
All right, let's vote again.
Um, let's do not guilty first.

33:16.433 --> 33:19.300
So, five for not guilty.
What about guilty?

33:24.167 --> 33:26.632
Wait a minute. You, Mr. Foreman,

33:26.633 --> 33:28.832
you didn't raise your hand
for either.

33:28.833 --> 33:31.600
He's right.
Well, sir, what's your vote?

33:33.367 --> 33:35.799
As you said, you're the one
who's been charged

33:35.800 --> 33:39.400
with being in control here,
keeping things orderly.

33:40.467 --> 33:42.666
This is not setting
a good example.

33:42.667 --> 33:46.000
You're correct.
This has just gotten difficult.

33:46.500 --> 33:49.033
- It's not difficult to me.
- Certainly not to me!

33:49.467 --> 33:51.532
Some of you have just gone
completely off the deep end

33:51.533 --> 33:53.573
because of this radical,
little Christian girl here.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.433
I've my own mind, all right?

33:57.067 --> 33:58.766
Now, she might have made
a few good points

33:58.767 --> 34:00.499
which others built on,

34:00.500 --> 34:02.766
and the judge
with his few words solidified,

34:02.767 --> 34:05.599
but, for me,
it was this young lady.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.699
Me?

34:06.700 --> 34:07.740
Yes, ma'am. You.

34:09.367 --> 34:13.132
You have succinctly
summarized it. At least, for me.

34:15.567 --> 34:17.766
So, I have to change
my vote to not guilty.

34:18.667 --> 34:21.831
I don't believe this. I'm gonna
push back my business meeting.

34:21.833 --> 34:24.331
What is so important
about this business meeting?

34:24.333 --> 34:27.132
You keep talking about it.
What is so important about it?

34:27.132 --> 34:30.366
None of your business.
Do you like that? Huh? Huh?

34:30.367 --> 34:32.266
That's a double entendre.

34:32.266 --> 34:34.831
I'm using business
in two different ways.

34:34.833 --> 34:37.132
You're acting like a moron.

34:37.132 --> 34:39.565
Let's go back to what
we were doing before, okay?

34:39.567 --> 34:40.732
Going around the table

34:40.733 --> 34:43.331
and each giving our argument
about why they are guilty.

34:43.333 --> 34:45.766
There was so much clarity when
we walked out of that courtroom

34:45.766 --> 34:47.532
and first walked into this room.

34:47.533 --> 34:50.232
Very true. I believe
if we can actually focus

34:50.233 --> 34:52.199
on the law of kidnapping itself,

34:52.199 --> 34:54.065
this can become
very simple again.

34:54.067 --> 34:56.099
And you, or some of you,

34:56.100 --> 34:58.467
who have changed your vote
to not guilty

34:59.367 --> 35:01.767
will go back very quickly
to guilty.

35:02.533 --> 35:05.566
Even me?
Who was never at guilty?

35:05.567 --> 35:07.532
It seems that you have
a special understanding

35:07.533 --> 35:09.300
of the law, my dear.

35:09.767 --> 35:11.567
I hope that the legal reasons

35:12.300 --> 35:14.799
shed some light on you
and your way of thinking.

35:14.800 --> 35:17.232
There is a light
at the end of this tunnel

35:17.233 --> 35:19.766
and I believe
that you will ultimately see it.

35:19.767 --> 35:21.533
Can we disband
the light analogies?

35:23.300 --> 35:24.300
I believe I'm next.

35:25.400 --> 35:28.066
Given that only
juror number two had spoken

35:28.067 --> 35:30.532
when we were presenting our
arguments in a systematic,

35:30.533 --> 35:32.399
organized manner.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.600
Well said!
Let's get a move on this.

35:35.467 --> 35:36.700
They are guilty

35:37.433 --> 35:42.332
because they have violated
Staci's basic rights

35:42.333 --> 35:44.767
to life, liberty,
the pursuit of happiness.

35:46.100 --> 35:50.666
They took away her way of life
as she knew it, and liberty.

35:50.667 --> 35:54.267
Forget liberty, she was stuck
in a room for seven months!

35:55.100 --> 35:58.332
Now, let's take an exact look at
what Robert Lation,

35:58.333 --> 35:59.733
the ringleader
of the kidnapping...

36:02.733 --> 36:05.599
had to say about his role in it.

36:06.800 --> 36:10.767
Do not speak.
Do not say a word.

36:12.467 --> 36:14.766
You not only have the right
to remain silent...

36:15.900 --> 36:21.067
...you will remain silent
while I speak. Understood?

36:22.533 --> 36:25.600
- Yes.
- I said remain silent.

36:27.333 --> 36:32.100
Now, you're probably
wondering who I am.

36:33.167 --> 36:35.332
The same as you wondering

36:35.333 --> 36:38.433
who the other women are
who're standing with you.

36:39.467 --> 36:42.700
Same as you're wondering
where you are,

36:43.367 --> 36:48.733
the same as you're wondering
why you are where you are.

36:52.833 --> 36:59.267
You have all committed
a terrible sin.

37:01.533 --> 37:06.600
Ah, Ms. Posey,
you're the first to realize.

37:09.700 --> 37:14.733
Think of me as a member
of the criminal justice system.

37:16.167 --> 37:19.133
Unfortunately for you,
I'm not a lawyer.

37:20.067 --> 37:23.166
Nor I am the police,
nor a prosecutor

37:23.167 --> 37:25.333
and alas, I'm not the judge.

37:26.567 --> 37:29.600
No, I'm not your judge, ladies.

37:30.833 --> 37:34.533
I am... your jailer.

37:36.167 --> 37:38.067
Calls himself their jailer.

37:39.333 --> 37:42.233
Under the law, if you jail
someone against her will,

37:43.167 --> 37:45.233
you're guilty of kidnapping.

37:46.067 --> 37:49.266
- It's as clear as that.
- Of course, it is. Great point.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.266
These girls, they weren't even
allowed to speak

37:51.267 --> 37:52.699
unless they were
given permission.

37:52.700 --> 37:54.432
- Girl.
- Huh?

37:54.433 --> 37:56.267
Girl. Singular, remember?

37:56.767 --> 37:58.633
Staci Horowitz,
who was kidnapped.

37:59.500 --> 38:02.300
Lara Posey and Laura Fields
were a part of the crime.

38:03.100 --> 38:06.132
I know, that's right.
I... Yes.

38:06.133 --> 38:08.799
These girls were just pretending
to be in this hell with her.

38:08.800 --> 38:13.166
Oh, please. Cry me a river!
This was barely hell.

38:13.167 --> 38:16.099
Staci was fed well, clothed,
she had medical care

38:16.100 --> 38:18.099
and she wasn't in
a freezing room like this.

38:18.100 --> 38:19.267
At least they had heat.

38:19.800 --> 38:20.899
You want to see hell?

38:20.900 --> 38:23.399
Come to my empty bed
every night. Now, that's hell!

38:24.400 --> 38:25.799
Please, don't diminish
what happened to her.

38:25.800 --> 38:27.767
She was held captive
for seven months.

38:28.400 --> 38:30.699
You know, comfortable
accommodations or not.

38:30.700 --> 38:33.167
Well, let's also get
all the facts straight.

38:34.133 --> 38:36.532
Robert Lation was the only one
they had to ask permission

38:36.533 --> 38:38.632
to speak,
and he wasn't around that often.

38:38.633 --> 38:39.666
Other than him,

38:39.667 --> 38:42.299
they were allowed to speak
freely at all times.

38:42.300 --> 38:44.532
In fact,
they were encouraged to have

38:44.533 --> 38:46.566
thoughtful discussions
about abortion.

38:46.567 --> 38:48.600
Both pro-life and pro-choice.

38:50.067 --> 38:51.466
This tells us a lot.

38:52.733 --> 38:54.467
Before we go any further,

38:55.067 --> 38:57.100
I want you all to really
understand a few things.

39:00.233 --> 39:03.467
Yes. We certainly want
to change your minds.

39:04.233 --> 39:07.432
But we know we can't do that by
shoving things down your throat.

39:07.433 --> 39:11.767
So, you will just be watching
movies and documentaries,

39:12.833 --> 39:15.533
reading books,
hearing experts speak.

39:16.367 --> 39:19.166
You'll hear opinions on both
sides of the coin.

39:19.167 --> 39:21.033
From everyone and everyone.

39:21.733 --> 39:23.666
And then we'll have an
opportunity to do something

39:23.667 --> 39:25.133
that no one really ever has.

39:26.700 --> 39:28.499
We'll have
an abortion think-tank

39:28.500 --> 39:30.033
for the next seven months.

39:31.533 --> 39:33.333
Oh, yes.

39:34.300 --> 39:38.199
Nonstop discussions
and probably arguments

39:38.200 --> 39:40.500
on the wholly
important topic of abortion.

39:43.667 --> 39:47.099
If your minds are changed,
we've had a huge bonus.

39:47.100 --> 39:51.633
If not, that most important
primary goal has still been met.

39:53.733 --> 39:59.067
Natalie, Lara, Staci,
look at me.

40:02.400 --> 40:06.033
We will never hurt you.
I promise you.

40:07.567 --> 40:10.400
As soon as your babies are born,
you'll all be freed.

40:16.133 --> 40:17.432
We should be taking away

40:17.433 --> 40:19.167
two important things
from that segment.

40:20.133 --> 40:22.432
First,
we should be having the same

40:22.433 --> 40:24.199
thoughtful discussion
about abortion.

40:24.200 --> 40:25.666
Just as Dr. Wise said,

40:25.667 --> 40:27.699
discussing both sides
of the coin

40:27.700 --> 40:29.620
so we can really understand
what's at stake here.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.766
And, second,
right from the beginning,

40:32.767 --> 40:35.066
she told Staci
that she wouldn't be harmed

40:35.067 --> 40:37.366
and that she would be freed
as soon as she gave birth

40:37.367 --> 40:38.700
and that's exactly
what happened.

40:39.367 --> 40:41.366
Staci was freed right after she
delivered her babies

40:41.367 --> 40:42.766
and she was never harmed.

40:42.767 --> 40:45.133
Honey, there are many
different kinds of harm.

40:45.667 --> 40:49.500
Having your liberty restrained
constitutes harm under the law.

40:50.267 --> 40:54.499
As for psychological harm,
here, we'll look at this now.

40:56.633 --> 41:01.533
The three of you already had
your chance to choose life. Hmm.

41:03.400 --> 41:04.400
And you failed.

41:06.500 --> 41:10.666
You were told earlier that
you're gonna stay with Dr. Wise

41:10.667 --> 41:14.000
until you give birth and
that will never change.

41:15.700 --> 41:16.700
Dr. Wise?

41:18.533 --> 41:21.199
Should you have any thoughts
of escape,

41:21.200 --> 41:23.399
you should know that you are
hundreds of miles

41:23.400 --> 41:25.566
- from any other people.
- Where are we?

41:25.567 --> 41:27.666
Young lady, kindly understand

41:27.667 --> 41:29.832
that you're never to speak
when I'm with you,

41:29.833 --> 41:32.400
unless I specifically
give you permission!

41:34.533 --> 41:35.633
Dr. Wise.

41:40.700 --> 41:43.067
Lift up the back of your hair.

41:44.333 --> 41:48.033
Touch high up on your neck.
You have bandages there

41:49.233 --> 41:52.433
where I have implanted
small electronic devices.

41:53.700 --> 41:55.766
It was minor laser surgery,

41:55.767 --> 41:58.599
but nonetheless
a necessary procedure

41:58.600 --> 42:01.000
to ensure that we meet
that primary goal.

42:03.300 --> 42:07.567
Now, Staci, do you have a
question? Just one, please.

42:11.833 --> 42:14.199
What are these electronic
devices supposed to do to us?

42:15.367 --> 42:18.267
That's a good question.
Dr. Wise.

42:20.333 --> 42:23.099
Under the unlikely circumstances

42:23.100 --> 42:25.566
that you should escape
this building

42:25.567 --> 42:29.467
into the frost-bitten cold of
night in your little nightgown,

42:30.467 --> 42:32.733
you will pass out within ten
feet of the door.

42:33.500 --> 42:34.767
Any of you have a dog?

42:37.600 --> 42:40.666
You have one of those invisible
electronic fences

42:40.667 --> 42:42.467
that are in your yard
or under the ground?

42:43.767 --> 42:45.732
No. But you all understand

42:45.733 --> 42:48.633
how the invisible
electronic fences work?

42:49.400 --> 42:54.067
Zip! The dog get stung
if it passes the fence.

42:55.167 --> 42:56.167
Dr. Wise.

42:57.467 --> 43:01.533
Well, you won't get stung.
But you will pass out.

43:02.667 --> 43:05.166
Of course,
the baby won't be harmed

43:05.167 --> 43:07.766
as a low voltage
electronic impulse

43:07.767 --> 43:10.766
will release a harmless
anesthetic into your bloodstream

43:10.767 --> 43:13.367
that will temporarily cause you
to lose consciousness

43:13.800 --> 43:15.700
and then we'll retrieve you
from the snow.

43:18.200 --> 43:20.267
Enjoy the accommodations.

43:23.800 --> 43:26.366
Under the law,
I'm sure you'll all agree

43:26.367 --> 43:29.233
that implanting an electronic
device in someone's head

43:30.367 --> 43:34.066
which could cause them to be
rendered unconscious is harmful.

43:34.067 --> 43:36.066
Again, good point.

43:36.067 --> 43:38.367
You both are missing something
here that's critical.

43:38.833 --> 43:41.700
Dr. Wise never implanted
the device in Stacy Horowitz.

43:42.567 --> 43:45.699
After her release, she was
examined by several doctors,

43:45.700 --> 43:47.532
and all their medical reports
came back negative

43:47.533 --> 43:49.167
for any surgeries
performed on her.

43:50.067 --> 43:52.199
The fact is,
it was just a scare tactic.

43:52.200 --> 43:53.799
Yes. But that scare tactic

43:53.800 --> 43:56.732
equates harm as much as a
physical beating.

43:56.733 --> 44:00.400
And months of restraint
causes harm just the same.

44:02.400 --> 44:06.499
Victoria Wise, Robert Lation,
Lara Foley and Natalie Fields

44:06.500 --> 44:08.599
through their illicit
kidnapping conspiracy

44:08.600 --> 44:12.266
are all guilty of
causing Staci Horowitz

44:12.267 --> 44:14.600
to suffer extreme
psychological damages.

44:16.600 --> 44:19.266
But if they hadn't held Staci
for seven months,

44:19.267 --> 44:21.267
we would have two dead babies

44:22.400 --> 44:25.566
instead of those two beautiful
seven year old children

44:25.567 --> 44:27.100
we all saw speak at trial.

44:28.300 --> 44:29.620
And that's the heart
of this case.

44:33.167 --> 44:37.467
Dana, Nicholas,
I'm Marina Durov. I'm a lawyer.

44:37.700 --> 44:41.732
I'm here to talk to you about
your biological mum and dad.

44:41.733 --> 44:44.432
Do you understand what I mean by
your biological mum and dad?

44:44.433 --> 44:46.332
- No.
- I do.

44:46.333 --> 44:48.399
My real mommy and daddy
aren't my real mommy and daddy,

44:48.400 --> 44:49.799
other ones are.

44:49.800 --> 44:51.466
Nicholas, now do you understand?

44:51.467 --> 44:54.067
Yes, my parents told me about
Staci and James.

44:54.533 --> 44:55.533
That's right.

44:56.733 --> 45:00.633
Staci Horowitz and James Rice
are your biological mom and dad.

45:01.333 --> 45:03.633
Your biological dad
would like to meet you.

45:04.533 --> 45:07.200
- Would you like that, Dana?
- Yes, I would love to meet him.

45:08.133 --> 45:09.532
How about you, Nicholas?

45:09.533 --> 45:12.300
I don't know. Can we talk about
something else?

45:13.600 --> 45:16.300
Yes, we can talk about
something else for a while.

45:16.800 --> 45:20.600
But we have to talk about your
biological daddy again, okay?

45:21.233 --> 45:23.132
Okay,
but can we talk about cars?

45:23.133 --> 45:25.732
I love famous cars.
What kind of cars do you have?

45:25.733 --> 45:27.599
I have all kinds of cars.

45:27.600 --> 45:32.366
I have a Porsche, a Mercedes,
a BMW, a Camaro and a Mustang.

45:32.367 --> 45:34.607
But they are not real cars,
they're just little toy cars.

45:35.300 --> 45:36.333
Okay.

45:43.133 --> 45:47.567
These are two wonderful,
living human beings.

45:49.200 --> 45:51.299
It's a fact that
they would be dead today

45:51.300 --> 45:53.832
if Dr. Wise and the others
hadn't helped Staci.

45:53.833 --> 45:55.633
You're just playing
on our emotions.

45:56.667 --> 45:58.627
This is what I was
talking about before.

45:59.533 --> 46:01.533
Whoever their parents are now,
I'm sure,

46:02.200 --> 46:04.000
couldn't imagine life
without them.

46:04.733 --> 46:08.033
Just watching them
give me chills

46:08.833 --> 46:11.733
thinking they would have been
butchered and not here.

46:36.300 --> 46:39.067
This is my son, Steven.

46:39.833 --> 46:41.633
He's 15. Great kid.

46:42.300 --> 46:43.699
You should see him
play lacrosse.

46:46.233 --> 46:47.166
He's handsome. Bet he's got
a lot of girlfriends, huh?

46:47.167 --> 46:50.199
Oh, yeah.
He's constantly on his phone,

46:50.200 --> 46:52.099
texting, tweeting,
I don't know what.

46:52.100 --> 46:54.199
He doesn't even know
half the kids.

46:54.200 --> 46:56.266
Same with mine.
They're only eight and nine.

46:58.167 --> 46:59.432
You know, I can't remember
the last time

46:59.433 --> 47:01.266
we had a real conversation.

47:01.267 --> 47:04.166
It's like his phone is
surgically attached to his hand.

47:04.167 --> 47:06.000
So, you see where
I'm coming from then?

47:06.533 --> 47:09.067
No. Just the opposite.

47:10.300 --> 47:12.666
The fact that my wife
chose to have my son

47:12.667 --> 47:15.766
doesn't disallow somebody
else from choosing not to.

47:15.767 --> 47:17.499
Steven's a great kid,

47:17.500 --> 47:21.299
but when he was just conceived,
even after a couple of months,

47:21.300 --> 47:23.532
he was still just that
lump of cells.

47:23.533 --> 47:25.099
So, it would have been all right

47:25.100 --> 47:26.733
if he'd been aborted
by your wife?

47:27.733 --> 47:31.299
Abortion is legal. If she'd
wanted to have it, she could.

47:31.300 --> 47:33.166
If the man wanted
the abortion to happen,

47:33.167 --> 47:34.732
he could have wanted that too.

47:34.733 --> 47:37.066
They could do with it
whatever they wanted to.

47:37.067 --> 47:38.187
Now, he's an "it"?

47:40.467 --> 47:43.200
Taking out the humanity
makes it easier, doesn't it?

47:46.367 --> 47:47.367
Not guilty.

47:50.300 --> 47:52.267
These two beautiful children
deserve to live.

47:55.067 --> 47:56.666
And I feel awful.

47:56.667 --> 48:00.200
You feel awful?
Why do you feel awful?

48:01.567 --> 48:03.233
Because I voted
not guilty before.

48:04.700 --> 48:06.332
And that no matter
how it was done

48:06.333 --> 48:08.767
these beautiful children
would not be alive.

48:11.400 --> 48:14.600
I had never thought of it
this way at all, but...

48:17.333 --> 48:19.253
their lives are just more
important than the law.

48:21.567 --> 48:22.567
And you are right.

48:25.500 --> 48:26.533
Not guilty.

48:28.800 --> 48:30.599
You wanted
the expert report charts

48:30.600 --> 48:33.300
on child development
in the womb?

48:34.367 --> 48:36.566
Yes, how did you know?

48:36.567 --> 48:39.266
Oh, either I'm a mind reader

48:39.267 --> 48:43.366
or secretly and illegally
listening to your deliberations.

48:43.367 --> 48:44.367
Or...

48:45.633 --> 48:48.266
Or I quietly picked up the phone
and asked the secretary for them

48:48.267 --> 48:50.432
while we were watching the
twins' testimony.

48:50.433 --> 48:51.433
Or that.

48:52.700 --> 48:54.732
I allowed into evidence

48:54.733 --> 48:57.199
the twins custody battle
deposition testimony

48:57.200 --> 48:58.699
and the deposition testimony
from the real father

48:58.700 --> 49:00.100
for a reason.

49:02.100 --> 49:04.099
And what was that, Your Honor?

49:04.100 --> 49:07.133
I find it irrelevant whether as
the defendants are guilty

49:08.267 --> 49:10.367
for kidnapping Staci Horowitz.

49:11.600 --> 49:13.567
I didn't find it irrelevant.

49:16.067 --> 49:17.832
I had another question
about the law.

49:17.833 --> 49:18.833
Yes?

49:19.600 --> 49:21.267
Let's say we have
the following facts.

49:22.267 --> 49:24.466
Jennifer is pregnant,
she wants to keep the baby,

49:24.467 --> 49:28.299
but Kelly is jealous of her
and tries to kill the baby

49:28.300 --> 49:31.033
by swinging a baseball bat
into her stomach.

49:31.500 --> 49:34.433
Then, Michael,
who's in a wheelchair,

49:35.100 --> 49:37.166
shoots and kills Kelly
to stop her

49:37.167 --> 49:39.327
from killing the baby that's
inside Jennifer's stomach.

49:39.767 --> 49:41.499
Why is Michael in a wheelchair?

49:42.700 --> 49:44.799
I don't know, I just thought
it made it more interesting.

49:44.800 --> 49:46.466
- Right, it did.
- Yup.

49:49.100 --> 49:51.067
So, how old is the fetus?

49:52.467 --> 49:53.732
Let's say two months.

49:53.733 --> 49:57.766
Ah, fetus is two months old, so
Michael shoots and kills Kelly

49:57.767 --> 50:00.232
to prevent her from killing the
fetus. So, the question is,

50:00.233 --> 50:02.232
did he act legally
in defense of another?

50:02.233 --> 50:04.199
Did he have the right to use
lethal force

50:04.200 --> 50:06.733
to save the life of
a two-month-old fetus?

50:11.400 --> 50:14.133
- Your Honor, what's the answer?
- Go through that file first.

50:16.233 --> 50:17.400
Wow, it's cold in here.

50:21.167 --> 50:23.566
I don't know how anyone can sit
through this at trial

50:23.567 --> 50:26.299
and not clearly see a human

50:26.300 --> 50:27.700
growing and changing
by the week?

50:29.733 --> 50:32.267
- Looks like a baby.
- No question.

50:35.767 --> 50:37.667
My turn.
May I have that, please?

50:41.500 --> 50:45.133
What you are calling a baby
looks more like a tadpole.

50:46.267 --> 50:47.299
It has no eyes or ears.

50:47.300 --> 50:49.632
It's barely distinguishable
as male or female.

50:49.633 --> 50:51.399
So, you think
that's more important

50:51.400 --> 50:53.299
than punishing the kidnappers?

50:53.300 --> 50:54.632
Wow, at seven weeks old,

50:54.633 --> 50:57.132
it actually really does look
like a baby.

50:57.133 --> 50:59.533
Yes, that's what I mean.
Let's pass that around.

51:00.600 --> 51:04.566
Staci Horowitz was kidnapped
at about eight weeks.

51:04.567 --> 51:07.199
If you knew, or for the men,

51:07.200 --> 51:11.299
your female significant other
had this growing inside you,

51:11.300 --> 51:12.633
would you kill this?

51:13.400 --> 51:14.733
This is clearly a baby.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.499
We've been loosely playing this
game that each person get a turn

51:19.500 --> 51:20.766
to make his or her argument.

51:20.767 --> 51:24.767
And, so far, only a few of us
have gone and now it's my turn.

51:27.400 --> 51:29.633
Instead of taking my turn,
I have a request.

51:31.333 --> 51:33.667
Could you please
go to that board

51:34.300 --> 51:36.333
and write down all the
points for an acquittal?

51:37.300 --> 51:39.466
Just short, simple recapping
of everything

51:39.467 --> 51:40.732
that we've already gone through

51:40.733 --> 51:43.199
that would give
a not guilty verdict.

51:43.200 --> 51:44.200
Sure.

51:44.800 --> 51:46.666
And on that board over there,

51:46.667 --> 51:48.299
can someone please write down
all the points

51:48.300 --> 51:50.232
that would be
for a guilty verdict.

51:50.233 --> 51:52.467
I'll be happy to do that.
Thank you.

51:53.133 --> 51:54.333
- Can I go first?
- Sure.

51:57.233 --> 52:01.799
I am listing what we have been
discussing today, is that right?

52:01.800 --> 52:02.800
Yes.

52:05.800 --> 52:08.532
Staci was kidnapped from an
abortion clinic,

52:08.533 --> 52:09.700
that's number one.

52:10.733 --> 52:12.832
And she was held
for seven months.

52:12.833 --> 52:15.299
So, it's not like they held her
for two weeks, or two days.

52:15.300 --> 52:16.532
It was a very long kidnapping.

52:16.533 --> 52:18.599
The prosecution made that point
strongly.

52:18.600 --> 52:21.033
The defendants put her through
all kinds of mental torture.

52:21.733 --> 52:24.500
And making her have babies
against her will,

52:25.200 --> 52:27.666
and making her believe that
she had a chip in her head

52:27.667 --> 52:30.067
that might knock
her unconscious.

52:30.467 --> 52:32.566
And in making her
actually believe

52:32.567 --> 52:35.266
that she was in hell
after she gave birth.

52:35.267 --> 52:36.732
Not to mention the physical pain

52:36.733 --> 52:39.399
she had to suffer
to deliver two babies.

52:39.400 --> 52:42.199
You're lucky that's something
you'll never have to endure.

52:44.700 --> 52:46.299
What's next?

52:46.300 --> 52:47.732
Miss Horowitz was forced
to undergo

52:47.733 --> 52:49.667
medical treatments
against her will.

52:50.700 --> 52:52.733
Not just compelled
to deliver the babies,

52:54.133 --> 52:58.199
but by having many
non-consensual examinations

52:58.200 --> 53:00.167
performed by Dr. Wise.

53:00.633 --> 53:02.332
And how about this?

53:02.333 --> 53:04.766
Staci had a legal right
to the abortion

53:04.767 --> 53:06.533
and they had no right
to stop her.

53:15.300 --> 53:16.733
Young lady, your case.

53:20.100 --> 53:23.600
Staci Horowitz was carrying
two live human beings.

53:24.400 --> 53:25.766
At the time when
she was first taken in

53:25.767 --> 53:27.400
by Dr. Wise and the others...

53:29.767 --> 53:34.467
look at this, her fetuses were
identifiable as human beings.

53:39.633 --> 53:42.066
The twins who are now
seven-years-old

53:42.067 --> 53:44.333
and beautiful would be dead.

53:46.800 --> 53:50.299
No doctor, no scientist,
no educator, no one

53:50.300 --> 53:52.066
has truly identified

53:52.067 --> 53:55.267
when a fetus miraculously
transforms into a human life.

54:00.700 --> 54:03.332
And after I write
everyone's point,

54:03.333 --> 54:05.600
I will add a few of my own.

54:08.533 --> 54:10.600
And now, I'm gonna
add my finishing touch.

54:17.200 --> 54:19.533
And how does the law
define a human life?

54:20.667 --> 54:23.699
The judge told us that if
a person kills

54:23.700 --> 54:25.799
a pregnant woman
and the baby in her stomach,

54:25.800 --> 54:27.532
he's guilty of a double murder.

54:27.533 --> 54:29.532
No matter what the age
of the fetus is.

54:29.533 --> 54:32.366
So, at any stage of life,

54:32.367 --> 54:34.500
the fetus is considered
a human being.

54:36.067 --> 54:37.067
Here are your two lists.

54:37.700 --> 54:38.700
Thank you.

54:39.800 --> 54:41.333
Number six, your turn

54:41.833 --> 54:44.066
I've given my reasons why I
changed my vote

54:44.067 --> 54:46.399
and I've said
all that I have to say.

54:46.400 --> 54:48.532
So, I think I'll pass
on my turn.

54:48.533 --> 54:50.332
Do we really need to
play by all these rules

54:50.333 --> 54:52.332
of going in turns for everyone?

54:52.333 --> 54:54.467
- I suppose not.
- Then let me say this.

54:55.700 --> 54:59.266
You can debate all you want.
Is this a baby? Is this a fetus?

54:59.267 --> 55:01.533
But what about the fact
that abortion is legal?

55:03.467 --> 55:06.399
Everyone, abortion is legal.

55:06.400 --> 55:09.699
Roe V. Wade has been the law of
the land for 40 years!

55:09.700 --> 55:12.199
Staci Horowitz wanted
to have an abortion

55:12.200 --> 55:14.667
and she had a legal
right to do so.

55:15.467 --> 55:18.232
These guys are right wing nuts.

55:18.233 --> 55:20.532
They were trying to
impose their views

55:20.533 --> 55:22.533
and stop her from having
the abortion

55:23.733 --> 55:26.432
I'm a vegetarian but I don't
kidnap people

55:26.433 --> 55:28.033
to stop them from eating meat.

55:29.433 --> 55:31.333
You know,
that's actually a good point.

55:32.100 --> 55:35.632
I'm an NRA member but I wouldn't
kidnap some anti-gun nut

55:35.633 --> 55:38.533
just because I disagree with his
beliefs. Like, that's extreme.

55:40.433 --> 55:43.133
It's more than just agreeing
or disagreeing.

55:43.767 --> 55:46.066
When a human life is at stake,

55:46.067 --> 55:49.400
it far outweighs everything
else, including rights.

55:53.600 --> 55:57.733
Well... I believe
in the right to choose.

55:58.533 --> 56:00.399
A woman does not have to
have a child

56:00.400 --> 56:01.500
if she doesn't want to.

56:02.200 --> 56:05.533
So, I'm not changing
my vote, ever.

56:06.367 --> 56:07.732
They're guilty.

56:07.733 --> 56:10.700
The right to choose
is indeed very important.

56:11.833 --> 56:14.633
What about the cases
of rape and incest?

56:15.467 --> 56:18.732
Should those women be forced
to have those children?

56:18.733 --> 56:19.767
Yes, of course.

56:20.867 --> 56:24.733
It's a terrible experience
to suffer rape or incest.

56:25.733 --> 56:28.799
But if a human life is
created as a result,

56:28.800 --> 56:31.100
that innocent child
should be allowed to live.

56:32.200 --> 56:34.299
You know, I was sort of with you
there for a while,

56:34.300 --> 56:37.167
but I don't agree with that
at all.

56:37.733 --> 56:39.466
Are you some kind of
religious nut

56:39.467 --> 56:41.732
like Dr. Wise and Robert Lation?

56:41.733 --> 56:43.733
I don't know what you mean
by "religious nut",

56:44.633 --> 56:47.100
but I do have
a very strong faith.

56:47.700 --> 56:49.799
I believe that the Bible
is the word of God

56:49.800 --> 56:51.499
and is 100 percent true.

56:51.500 --> 56:53.566
Okay, then show me in the Bible

56:53.567 --> 56:55.632
where it says anything
about abortion?

56:55.633 --> 56:58.167
One of the ten commandments.
Thou shall not kill.

56:58.800 --> 57:02.132
That's talking about
actual acts of murders.

57:02.133 --> 57:05.699
From one person to the other.
Real, living people, of course.

57:05.700 --> 57:09.232
Yes, that's exactly what
we have with abortion.

57:09.233 --> 57:11.266
While it's true
that the word abortion

57:11.267 --> 57:12.799
is never mentioned in the Bible,

57:12.800 --> 57:15.332
there are tons of passages
that clearly address

57:15.333 --> 57:17.200
the sanctity of human life.

57:18.467 --> 57:21.533
- Can we get a Bible in here?
- Oh, this is a disaster!

57:22.467 --> 57:25.232
Can you also get a copy of
Webster's Dictionary,

57:25.233 --> 57:26.699
The Farmers' Almanac,

57:26.700 --> 57:30.166
today's newspaper and
a copy of Sports Illustrated?

57:30.167 --> 57:32.099
Swimsuit edition, please.

57:32.100 --> 57:34.266
Hey, yes. This is foreman from
the abortion case.

57:34.267 --> 57:36.432
Uh, we need to
get a Bible in here.

57:36.433 --> 57:38.732
- What version?
- What version?

57:38.733 --> 57:40.332
I don't know, What do you got?

57:40.333 --> 57:42.099
We have King James version.

57:42.100 --> 57:43.500
King James? Cool, that'll work.

57:44.733 --> 57:47.233
Hey, you got any word on the
heat yet? It's freezing in here.

57:48.733 --> 57:50.166
Hello?

58:01.233 --> 58:02.233
Steve, old buddy,

58:03.300 --> 58:05.533
looks like I won't be home
in time for dinner tonight.

58:08.333 --> 58:10.532
Now, I've been working for weeks

58:10.533 --> 58:13.000
to get this business meeting
together.

58:14.167 --> 58:17.400
And now, I'm gonna miss it,
thanks to you guys. Thank you.

58:18.133 --> 58:19.666
Whoa! I needed a break.

58:19.667 --> 58:21.666
From
The Good, the Bad and the Ugly?

58:21.667 --> 58:24.533
Uh. From my very warm office.

58:26.067 --> 58:27.733
- Who asked for a Bible?
- I did.

58:28.533 --> 58:30.433
Are you preaching
or deliberating?

58:30.833 --> 58:33.299
We're hoping it'll help
with our deliberating.

58:33.300 --> 58:35.666
You know, it looks like you're
being really thorough

58:35.667 --> 58:38.300
and thoughtful. That's good.
Good.

58:39.600 --> 58:42.300
Do you have the answer
to my last legal question?

58:42.700 --> 58:43.733
Sure do.

58:57.833 --> 59:01.133
For starters, Genesis 1:27:

59:02.633 --> 59:05.333
"So God created man
in his own image,

59:06.133 --> 59:08.267
in the image of God
created him he

59:09.333 --> 59:12.599
male and female
created he them."

59:12.600 --> 59:14.699
What does this have
to do with abortion?

59:14.700 --> 59:17.132
God created humans in his image.

59:17.133 --> 59:20.133
We are all set apart from all of
God's creations.

59:22.633 --> 59:27.699
Genesis 1:28: "And God blessed
them and God said unto them,

59:27.700 --> 59:30.066
Be fruitful, and multiply,

59:30.067 --> 59:31.667
and replenish the earth,
and subdue it

59:32.367 --> 59:34.599
and have dominion
over the fish of the sea,

59:34.600 --> 59:36.666
and over the fowl of the air,

59:36.667 --> 59:40.333
and over every living thing
that moveth upon the earth."

59:42.233 --> 59:43.632
Does that sound like
God wants us

59:43.633 --> 59:45.367
to kill innocent human beings?

59:46.133 --> 59:48.332
That's totally open
to interpretation.

59:48.333 --> 59:50.499
Is that really
what you think it means?

59:50.500 --> 59:53.399
I mean, someone else may think
something completely different.

59:53.400 --> 59:54.600
That's where faith comes in.

59:55.667 --> 59:58.066
You pray, you study.

59:58.067 --> 01:00:01.232
You call upon what God helps you
to just know to be true.

01:00:01.233 --> 01:00:03.067
Great, a sermon.

01:00:05.567 --> 01:00:08.300
- Of course, there's more.
- But, wait, there's more.

01:00:09.667 --> 01:00:11.333
Psalm 22:10:

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:15.067
"I was cast upon thee
from the womb

01:00:16.067 --> 01:00:18.400
thou art my God
from my mother's belly.

01:00:19.367 --> 01:00:21.132
God loves us and protects us

01:00:21.133 --> 01:00:22.832
from the moment we are
conceived.

01:00:22.833 --> 01:00:25.300
Obviously, He doesn't want
someone He loves to be killed.

01:00:27.067 --> 01:00:31.199
And Psalm 139:13-14 says:

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.799
"Thou hast covered me
in my mother's womb.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:37.733
I will praise thee; For I am
fearfully and wonderfully made."

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:42.733
Faith is manipulation of
common sense, my dear.

01:00:44.467 --> 01:00:47.799
And even if you want to argue
God loves people,

01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:50.567
it's not necessarily saying
anything about abortion.

01:00:51.633 --> 01:00:54.366
Nor about the law
we're obligated to follow.

01:00:54.367 --> 01:00:55.467
Are you so sure?

01:00:56.467 --> 01:00:59.467
We must follow the law of God
above all else.

01:01:00.100 --> 01:01:02.199
That's if you believe in God.

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:04.132
Who are you to impose your
religious views

01:01:04.133 --> 01:01:06.199
on us in here in a jury room

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.232
where we're supposed to be
deliberating a kidnapping case.

01:01:09.233 --> 01:01:11.300
We need a separation
of Church and hate.

01:01:14.333 --> 01:01:18.033
Yes, I have my faith.
My total belief in God,

01:01:19.267 --> 01:01:21.466
but for those of you
who aren't there yet,

01:01:21.467 --> 01:01:24.332
what is all-American law
based upon?

01:01:24.333 --> 01:01:26.566
American law,
English law, all law,

01:01:26.567 --> 01:01:30.466
they're all first and foremost
based on 10 Commandments.

01:01:30.467 --> 01:01:33.399
The gentlemen next to you
brought up the 10 Commandments.

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:36.033
The Commandment that says
"thou shall not kill",

01:01:36.833 --> 01:01:38.633
that should be pertinent
to everyone in here.

01:01:39.767 --> 01:01:42.299
Every translation,
every biblical scholar,

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:44.233
anyone who studied
ancient texts,

01:01:44.733 --> 01:01:48.300
everyone agrees that that
means 'thou shall not murder'.

01:01:50.067 --> 01:01:51.533
As in killing innocent life.

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:55.066
What's more innocent
than an unborn child?

01:01:55.067 --> 01:01:58.100
I'm not religious, so I'm going
to look at this differently.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.832
I'm not saying that she's
right or wrong

01:02:00.833 --> 01:02:03.299
about that stuff in the Bible,

01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:05.099
but I think we need to look at
the hard facts

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:06.633
written on that chart.

01:02:07.633 --> 01:02:10.266
Ah, excuse me, everyone, the
maintenance staff has gone home.

01:02:10.267 --> 01:02:12.132
It's after five,
but you're lucky,

01:02:12.133 --> 01:02:14.233
I know quite a bit about heat.

01:02:21.533 --> 01:02:23.767
This guy's never gonna
let us be together, Stevo.

01:02:25.267 --> 01:02:26.947
Looks like I'm gonna be
stuck here forever.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.499
I think I know
what the problem is,

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:31.299
that I have to work under the
boiler rooms.

01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:32.340
It should be working soon.

01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.499
So, as I was saying,
I think it's really egregious

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:41.500
that they mess with
Staci's mind.

01:02:42.133 --> 01:02:43.699
It was bad enough
that they kidnapped her,

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:45.432
but on top of it to...

01:02:45.433 --> 01:02:48.733
to force her to watch
those crazy horror films.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.267
They gave her nightmares.

01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:59.499
I mean,
I thought that was horrible.

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:00.799
I would have really freaked out

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.066
if I had to
watch things like that.

01:03:03.067 --> 01:03:07.167
Now, this will add to the
mental torture on the chart.

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:13.367
You have the right to do what
you want with your own body.

01:03:14.367 --> 01:03:16.232
If you don't want the fetus,
abort it.

01:03:22.333 --> 01:03:24.599
Abort the fetus
if you don't want it.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:26.599
It's your body, abort it!

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.300
It's your body,
do what you want with it.

01:03:41.167 --> 01:03:43.767
Abort the fetus
if you don't want it.

01:03:45.667 --> 01:03:47.332
Abort the baby!

01:03:47.333 --> 01:03:49.366
Abort the baby!

01:03:49.367 --> 01:03:50.599
Abort the baby.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.099
Abort the baby!

01:03:55.433 --> 01:03:56.532
Abort the baby!

01:03:56.533 --> 01:03:58.066
Abort the fetus.

01:04:34.067 --> 01:04:37.767
Well, definitely freaky.
Still doesn't change my mind.

01:04:39.333 --> 01:04:41.433
Seems like cruel and
unusual punishment to me.

01:04:42.067 --> 01:04:44.432
You may not agree with
some of their tactics,

01:04:44.433 --> 01:04:46.133
but they had a singular purpose.

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.299
To save those children.

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:51.100
And they had to use
various means to do that.

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:54.200
You know,
I'm a pretty rational man,

01:04:55.167 --> 01:04:57.767
now I'm getting down
to the basics.

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:02.333
Staci Horowitz made a choice
not to have a child,

01:05:03.167 --> 01:05:05.167
or children as it turns out.

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:08.599
She doesn't want to
have a child.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:10.567
That's a personal choice.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:13.000
So be it.

01:05:13.533 --> 01:05:15.332
It's between her and her doctor.

01:05:15.333 --> 01:05:16.832
But it's not that simple.

01:05:16.833 --> 01:05:19.299
You're forgetting
one important piece,

01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:23.033
she had a husband.
And he wanted to have the child.

01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:32.167
Can we revisit his
deposition testimony again?

01:05:32.667 --> 01:05:33.667
I'm already there.

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.000
Staci had
completely deceived me.

01:05:38.733 --> 01:05:40.399
When we decided to end
our marriage,

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.233
I knew she was pregnant.

01:05:42.833 --> 01:05:45.167
She knew that I wanted her
to keep the child.

01:05:45.667 --> 01:05:49.033
I asked her repeatedly. I begged
her not to have the abortion.

01:05:50.067 --> 01:05:52.832
But then, she just went ahead
and did it.

01:05:52.833 --> 01:05:55.166
Did Ms. Horowitz
state her reason

01:05:55.167 --> 01:05:57.266
why she went ahead with
the abortion?

01:05:57.267 --> 01:06:00.033
She was enacting some
kind of revenge against me.

01:06:01.767 --> 01:06:03.666
I decided to leave her for
another woman,

01:06:03.667 --> 01:06:06.500
which I know, of course,
hurt her.

01:06:08.567 --> 01:06:10.033
She said to me,

01:06:11.233 --> 01:06:13.200
"You have put me through
so much pain and sadness.

01:06:14.567 --> 01:06:16.567
Now it's your turn
to feel pain and sadness."

01:06:20.867 --> 01:06:25.699
Revenge or not, it was Staci's
right to have the abortion.

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:28.500
That's the uncontested law.

01:06:29.300 --> 01:06:31.466
I have to say,
I feel bad for the guy.

01:06:31.467 --> 01:06:33.700
What's worse is he still
hasn't met the children.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.532
Go to the part where he talks
about the judge

01:06:36.533 --> 01:06:37.732
not letting him have custody.

01:06:37.733 --> 01:06:38.866
Okay, one second.

01:06:38.867 --> 01:06:41.266
None of this is relevant as to
whether the defendants

01:06:41.267 --> 01:06:42.766
are guilty of kidnapping.

01:06:42.767 --> 01:06:45.099
I'm interested in seeing
his testimony again.

01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:47.066
What's up with you?
You just like to make requests

01:06:47.067 --> 01:06:49.066
and listen to things
without offering any opinions.

01:06:49.067 --> 01:06:50.666
I've given a few opinions,

01:06:50.667 --> 01:06:52.700
and how I evaluate things
is none of your business.

01:06:53.367 --> 01:06:54.367
Eh.

01:06:55.433 --> 01:06:56.533
Here, I've got it.

01:06:59.267 --> 01:07:03.199
And after Staci was released,
did you see your babies?

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.166
No. I didn't even know
she was kidnapped.

01:07:06.167 --> 01:07:08.333
I thought she had an abortion
and took off.

01:07:09.533 --> 01:07:11.732
I found out that I had two
infant children

01:07:11.733 --> 01:07:13.167
about a month after
they let her go.

01:07:14.367 --> 01:07:17.132
I... I got a letter
from Dr. Victoria Wise

01:07:17.133 --> 01:07:18.799
telling me that
I had a boy and a girl.

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.600
What did you do
when found that out?

01:07:22.367 --> 01:07:24.599
I went to a lawyer, and I filed
for custody

01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:25.700
in St. Louis where I live.

01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:33.266
But... At first we couldn't
even locate where Staci was.

01:07:33.267 --> 01:07:35.733
And we had to file all kinds of
papers to get her into court.

01:07:36.433 --> 01:07:38.499
She was out in Los Angeles

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:41.167
and the courts there
made us appear there.

01:07:43.433 --> 01:07:46.433
By that time,
it was, it was a year later.

01:07:48.733 --> 01:07:51.233
Staci had given up my babies
for adoption.

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:54.767
And she had a special request.

01:07:55.700 --> 01:07:57.699
That my children be split up

01:07:57.700 --> 01:07:59.632
and be given different adoptive
parents.

01:07:59.633 --> 01:08:02.166
And this crazy judge
agreed with her.

01:08:02.167 --> 01:08:03.667
He gave her what she wanted.

01:08:04.567 --> 01:08:07.599
He said that she had gone
through a horrific ordeal

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:09.499
and if things had been done
correctly under the law

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.400
she would have had an abortion.

01:08:14.333 --> 01:08:17.133
To rectify things, he said,
her wishes should be granted.

01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:21.000
So...

01:08:22.667 --> 01:08:24.366
now my daughter is somewhere
in Oregon

01:08:24.367 --> 01:08:25.767
and my son's in Maryland.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:30.167
Why wouldn't the judge
give you custody?

01:08:30.832 --> 01:08:33.265
Didn't he believe
you're the biological father?

01:08:33.267 --> 01:08:35.667
Staci had lied and said she
didn't know who the father was.

01:08:37.332 --> 01:08:38.666
Okay,
so we had a paternity test,

01:08:38.667 --> 01:08:40.700
and it proved that I am
their father.

01:08:42.399 --> 01:08:45.198
But, the judge said
it was too late.

01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.466
That Dana and Nicholas were with
their adoptive parents

01:08:47.466 --> 01:08:48.566
for too long

01:08:48.567 --> 01:08:50.607
and it was in their
best interest to stay with them.

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:56.733
So, now I'm still fighting
in federal court instead.

01:08:58.433 --> 01:09:00.767
I won't stop, I can't.

01:09:02.466 --> 01:09:04.832
I don't know how a woman could
kill my children,

01:09:04.832 --> 01:09:06.433
when I want them to be alive.

01:09:07.633 --> 01:09:10.432
And I don't know why I can't
have my children now,

01:09:10.433 --> 01:09:11.765
my flesh and blood,

01:09:11.767 --> 01:09:13.667
when I so desperately want them.

01:09:16.667 --> 01:09:19.567
There's no justice
in this insane world.

01:09:20.567 --> 01:09:22.567
Not for me, and not for them.

01:09:28.733 --> 01:09:31.299
I certainly don't agree with
everything you're saying,

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:34.033
and I certainly don't agree
with everything on that list.

01:09:35.466 --> 01:09:38.733
But, I'm changing my vote
to not guilty.

01:09:41.733 --> 01:09:43.599
You know, if for nothing else,

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.299
just so that man can have some
kind of justice.

01:09:46.300 --> 01:09:47.367
You can't be serious!

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:51.466
What does this have to do
with her being kidnapped?

01:09:51.466 --> 01:09:53.666
Two wrongs do not make a right!

01:09:53.667 --> 01:09:55.067
Perhaps they do.

01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:59.299
I suddenly can't help thinking

01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:02.033
that these children
deserve some justice.

01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:08.700
I don't know about the notion
that they would be dead.

01:10:10.267 --> 01:10:12.499
I still think that they would
just not be born

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.533
if she had had the abortion.

01:10:15.467 --> 01:10:20.100
Oh, with the definitional stuff,
it doesn't matter.

01:10:21.667 --> 01:10:25.767
They are here now. And whether
or not they know it today...

01:10:26.733 --> 01:10:29.367
they have been through
a terrific ordeal.

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.767
I think that they will
understand it in time.

01:10:35.133 --> 01:10:37.432
Specifically,
they'll understand this,

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:40.132
that they would not
have been born

01:10:40.133 --> 01:10:42.600
if it weren't for the
defendants in this case.

01:10:44.100 --> 01:10:47.467
That their father
wanted them to be born.

01:10:48.233 --> 01:10:50.799
And he wanted to care for them

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:54.566
when they were alive
and living in this world.

01:10:54.567 --> 01:10:56.733
They need us to recognize that.

01:10:57.367 --> 01:10:59.100
And we can do that by...

01:11:01.133 --> 01:11:03.733
showing that their lives
have value.

01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:09.100
By rendering a not guilty
verdict in this case.

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:13.799
I think a few wrongs here

01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:17.100
can make things right
for these children.

01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:21.667
They deserve... some justice.

01:11:24.133 --> 01:11:25.200
Not guilty.

01:11:33.267 --> 01:11:36.666
If you want definitions
and insanity,

01:11:36.667 --> 01:11:40.732
what has happened here
is the definition of insanity.

01:11:40.733 --> 01:11:43.066
All right,
let's just take another vote.

01:11:43.067 --> 01:11:45.632
Okay. Now, there's more not
guilty at this point.

01:11:45.633 --> 01:11:47.300
So, why don't we just
start there.

01:11:48.067 --> 01:11:50.100
All those in favor of
not guilty raise your hands.

01:11:57.733 --> 01:12:00.700
So, that's nine for not guilty.

01:12:02.533 --> 01:12:03.799
Yes? You have a question?

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:07.033
No. I want to change
my vote to not guilty.

01:12:07.567 --> 01:12:10.566
You are? For what reason?

01:12:10.567 --> 01:12:13.200
Well, just because I think
they're not guilty now.

01:12:14.433 --> 01:12:18.332
I know why I changed my mind,
and I made it clear early on.

01:12:18.333 --> 01:12:21.166
I've heard everyone else give
their reasons.

01:12:21.167 --> 01:12:23.200
I'm curious, what's yours?

01:12:24.433 --> 01:12:26.599
Well, I thought about my kids
not being born

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.533
and it turned me into a wuss.

01:12:29.733 --> 01:12:33.266
Yeah, that's funny. You know,

01:12:33.267 --> 01:12:35.700
we've all been discussing this
with great passion,

01:12:36.533 --> 01:12:40.533
and you've been firm on guilty.
I think we have a right to know.

01:12:41.433 --> 01:12:44.332
I changed my mind.
You said I would.

01:12:44.333 --> 01:12:47.200
"We have a legal right to vote
any way we want."

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.566
So, I am voting not guilty,

01:12:49.567 --> 01:12:51.532
so we can get out
of this damn place,

01:12:51.533 --> 01:12:54.066
and I can get to my meeting.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.499
That's no reason to change your
vote, man.

01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:00.100
Don't you...
Don't you have any principles?

01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.066
Don't you have any values?

01:13:02.067 --> 01:13:03.787
Don't you have anything
that you believe in?

01:13:04.767 --> 01:13:08.366
Were you voting guilty early on
just because everyone was?

01:13:08.367 --> 01:13:11.400
So that you could leave
and go to your precious meeting?

01:13:12.067 --> 01:13:15.733
No, no, no and yes.

01:13:16.767 --> 01:13:18.766
You may not understand
my methods,

01:13:18.767 --> 01:13:21.400
but my purpose is singular.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:25.599
And now, get out of my face.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.467
Guys, that's enough.

01:13:30.733 --> 01:13:31.733
That's it?

01:13:34.267 --> 01:13:35.667
You're a disgrace.

01:13:37.067 --> 01:13:39.400
And yet, the ladies love me.

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.533
Don't be bitter, kitty litter.

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:52.000
That leaves just two
of you at guilty.

01:13:53.767 --> 01:13:56.300
I can't get past
what the law is.

01:13:57.467 --> 01:13:59.599
It seems to me that you're all
engaging in

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.799
what is called
"jury nullification."

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.666
Your voting not guilty
is in direct contradiction

01:14:05.667 --> 01:14:08.199
to the statute of kidnapping
based on rationale

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:09.832
that has nothing to do
with the law.

01:14:09.833 --> 01:14:11.200
That's not so.

01:14:14.267 --> 01:14:18.332
While many of these items are
not directly part of the law,

01:14:18.333 --> 01:14:20.532
they're all part
of its fundamental fabric.

01:14:20.533 --> 01:14:22.366
And they're all crucial
in determining

01:14:22.367 --> 01:14:24.699
whether or not a crime
has been committed in this case.

01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:27.066
And here the law
clearly supports

01:14:27.067 --> 01:14:29.666
that a fetus is defined
as a human life.

01:14:29.667 --> 01:14:31.166
And if it's a human life,

01:14:31.167 --> 01:14:33.532
then protecting that human life
is surely legal.

01:14:33.533 --> 01:14:36.067
I'm surprised at your thinking.

01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:39.533
You're young. It's obvious
you're well educated.

01:14:40.367 --> 01:14:42.532
You probably had
a good career going.

01:14:42.533 --> 01:14:45.133
Most women in your position
are in favor of women's rights.

01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:49.732
I am in favor of women's rights,
and men's rights,

01:14:49.733 --> 01:14:52.500
and children's rights and
unborn children's rights.

01:14:53.133 --> 01:14:56.566
No one has the right to take the
life of an innocent human being,

01:14:56.567 --> 01:14:57.733
period.

01:14:58.333 --> 01:15:00.432
I'm sure in many abortion cases,

01:15:00.433 --> 01:15:03.100
these women don't think
of it at all. Not that way.

01:15:03.733 --> 01:15:06.699
Many women it's just not the
right time for their lives.

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:08.233
Think about it.

01:15:08.833 --> 01:15:10.832
Think about this on a real
personal level.

01:15:10.833 --> 01:15:12.667
Be true to yourself.

01:15:13.267 --> 01:15:15.366
What if you had been
working hard,

01:15:15.367 --> 01:15:17.132
trying to advance
in your career,

01:15:17.133 --> 01:15:19.832
and then, all of a sudden,
you get pregnant?

01:15:19.833 --> 01:15:22.366
And being pregnant
is going to set you back.

01:15:22.367 --> 01:15:24.366
Maybe even cause you to lose
your job,

01:15:24.367 --> 01:15:26.133
maybe even your entire career.

01:15:27.267 --> 01:15:31.266
For many women, it just isn't
the right time for them.

01:15:31.267 --> 01:15:33.599
So, they want to take the lives
of their unborn children

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:36.099
based on convenience?

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:37.466
That's not justifiable.

01:15:37.467 --> 01:15:39.832
If you get pregnant,
you have to deal with it.

01:15:39.833 --> 01:15:43.067
"Deal with it"?
It's not that simple.

01:15:44.133 --> 01:15:45.799
What about all those poor women
who cannot afford

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:47.466
to have a child?

01:15:47.467 --> 01:15:49.532
If they do carry
through the pregnancy,

01:15:49.533 --> 01:15:52.299
the child will be just born into
a life of poverty.

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:54.232
Not to mention that all of us,

01:15:54.233 --> 01:15:56.199
and the rest of us will be
paying for those kids

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:58.300
since the mothers
will be on welfare forever.

01:15:59.133 --> 01:16:02.100
You cannot take a life
based on convenience.

01:16:02.667 --> 01:16:05.666
Whether you're a financially
stable woman who's educated

01:16:05.667 --> 01:16:07.632
and doesn't want
to pause her career.

01:16:07.633 --> 01:16:09.832
Or a financially
distressed mother

01:16:09.833 --> 01:16:12.467
who thinks she can't
afford to feed another mouth.

01:16:14.267 --> 01:16:17.299
Looks like we're at
a perpetual stalemate.

01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:20.000
Shall we call the judge
and tell him we're a hung jury?

01:16:22.667 --> 01:16:24.633
I have the answer
to your last legal question.

01:16:25.833 --> 01:16:28.366
I'll recite your fact pattern
from memory.

01:16:28.367 --> 01:16:30.599
Jennifer is pregnant,
she wants to keep the baby,

01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:32.366
but Kelly is jealous of her

01:16:32.367 --> 01:16:33.832
and tries to kill the baby
inside Jennifer,

01:16:33.833 --> 01:16:37.132
by like smashing a baseball
bat into her stomach.

01:16:37.133 --> 01:16:40.367
And Michael who is in
a wheelchair

01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.732
shoots and kills Kelly

01:16:42.733 --> 01:16:46.266
to keep her from killing
the baby from inside Jennifer.

01:16:46.267 --> 01:16:49.099
And the fetus is two months old.

01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:51.732
- That's all correct?
- Yes, Your Honor.

01:16:51.733 --> 01:16:54.432
Michael's killing of Kelly is
not murder,

01:16:54.433 --> 01:16:56.132
it is not a homicide at all.

01:16:56.133 --> 01:16:58.799
It is a justifiable killing
under the self-defense statute

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:01.500
or more specifically under the
defense of another statute.

01:17:02.567 --> 01:17:03.567
You with me?

01:17:04.667 --> 01:17:07.499
You are permitted to use lethal
force to defend the life

01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:08.732
of a human being.

01:17:08.733 --> 01:17:09.733
That's correct.

01:17:10.967 --> 01:17:12.232
You're legally permitted to use
deadly force against a person

01:17:12.233 --> 01:17:14.266
if that person is using deadly
force against another person.

01:17:14.267 --> 01:17:15.732
So, in your fact pattern,

01:17:15.733 --> 01:17:18.832
Michael is legally able
to kill Kelly

01:17:18.833 --> 01:17:22.367
because Kelly is using deadly
force against the fetus...

01:17:23.567 --> 01:17:24.567
the baby...

01:17:25.567 --> 01:17:28.600
inside Jennifer's belly. See.

01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:35.700
So, again, Your Honor, the fetus
is defined as a human being.

01:17:41.533 --> 01:17:42.533
Now, here's your law.

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:46.366
The one-month old fetus
is defined,

01:17:46.367 --> 01:17:49.133
under the law, as a human life.

01:17:50.633 --> 01:17:52.499
Both in
the double murder scenario

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:55.132
and the defense of
another scenario.

01:17:55.133 --> 01:17:57.466
Now, let's apply this law
to the facts

01:17:57.467 --> 01:17:59.167
of the Staci Horowitz case.

01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:01.766
Dr. Wise and the others
held Staci

01:18:01.767 --> 01:18:04.066
to save the lives of the
two-month old fetuses

01:18:04.067 --> 01:18:05.600
that were inside her stomach.

01:18:06.367 --> 01:18:10.299
They saved the lives of these
two babies just the same as

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:12.100
Michael did
when he killed Kelly.

01:18:12.567 --> 01:18:14.232
The only difference is that

01:18:14.233 --> 01:18:17.332
Dr. Wise and her team
didn't kill Staci

01:18:17.333 --> 01:18:18.667
to stop the killing
of the babies.

01:18:20.067 --> 01:18:22.000
They didn't use
lethal force at all.

01:18:23.333 --> 01:18:26.433
They simply held Staci for seven
months until she gave birth.

01:18:27.333 --> 01:18:29.767
They allowed Staci to live,
just like her babies.

01:18:32.167 --> 01:18:34.766
Under the defense
of another statute,

01:18:34.767 --> 01:18:39.266
their alleged kidnapping
was not a crime at all.

01:18:39.267 --> 01:18:43.400
It was a justified use of force
to defend a human being's life.

01:18:44.267 --> 01:18:47.733
And that's the law.
We have to acquit.

01:18:50.233 --> 01:18:53.100
She's right. Oh, my God.

01:18:54.433 --> 01:18:58.167
She's right. She's right.

01:18:59.667 --> 01:19:04.600
Oh, my God.
Yes, she's right.

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:09.000
I will not acquit!
I will not acquit!

01:19:09.667 --> 01:19:11.632
- I will not acquit!
- Oh, my God.

01:19:11.633 --> 01:19:16.166
I will not acquit!
I will never acquit!

01:19:16.167 --> 01:19:18.766
They're guilty! They're guilty!
They are guilty!

01:19:18.767 --> 01:19:21.433
They are guilty!
I am not guilty!

01:19:22.233 --> 01:19:24.400
I will never acquit!
They're guilty!

01:19:25.167 --> 01:19:27.466
They're guilty!
I am not guilty!

01:19:27.467 --> 01:19:29.832
They're guilty! Do you hear me?
They're guilty!

01:19:29.833 --> 01:19:33.399
You're all insane!
They're guilty!

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:35.766
- They're guilty!
- Oh, my God!

01:19:35.767 --> 01:19:38.799
I will not acquit!
I will never acquit!

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:42.033
They're guilty! They're guilty!

01:19:43.533 --> 01:19:46.300
I'm not guilty. I'm not guilty.

01:19:49.700 --> 01:19:52.500
Oh, my God. Oh, my dear God.

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.467
Yes.

01:19:55.133 --> 01:19:56.832
What the hell is going on here?

01:19:56.833 --> 01:19:59.500
Hell is what's going on here.

01:20:02.167 --> 01:20:04.700
I aborted Steven
before he was born.

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:08.067
And I was the doctor
who performed the abortion.

01:20:12.333 --> 01:20:15.167
And yesterday,
you died of a heart attack.

01:20:15.800 --> 01:20:17.767
You were killed in a car crash.

01:20:19.467 --> 01:20:21.400
Today is judgment day.

01:20:22.367 --> 01:20:24.133
You recognized your wrongs,

01:20:24.767 --> 01:20:27.000
and repented
in that last moment.

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:29.733
You did not.

01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:34.033
And for that,
you will never meet Steven.

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:39.333
And you will not be at my side.

01:20:44.067 --> 01:20:47.467
Nor the side of my own child.

01:20:49.367 --> 01:20:55.167
Welcome to your eternity
of solitude.
