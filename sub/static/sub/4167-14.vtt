00:01.619 --> 00:03.078
<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...

00:03.120 --> 00:06.248
- I've been shot.
- Are we sure this is the way to the hospital?

00:06.332 --> 00:10.419
We ain't going to no hospital.
We got our own guy, Dr Tupelo.

00:10.502 --> 00:13.839
Dumb-name will know my wrath.
The wrath of Doug.

00:13.923 --> 00:17.343
What kind of man tears a cross
off the roof of a church?

00:17.426 --> 00:20.429
An impressive one, I'm guessing.
That's a big fucking cross.

00:21.513 --> 00:24.975
I need to rent your empty house.
We need a grow house.

00:25.017 --> 00:28.395
<i>- How did that cross get in there?
- Doug snuck it in on Sanjay's shift.</i>

00:28.479 --> 00:30.231
I'm opening up another supply line.

00:30.314 --> 00:32.858
There's this biker chick
that Andy wants to fuck

00:32.942 --> 00:34.693
and a guy named Chess.

00:34.777 --> 00:38.530
Let me show you what I got for you.
You're gonna be a loyal customer.

00:38.614 --> 00:39.990
This weed sucks.

00:40.532 --> 00:42.076
This is inferior product.

00:42.159 --> 00:44.453
Our business arrangement's
not gonna work out.

00:44.537 --> 00:47.957
- And why is that?
- My customers don't seem to like your product.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.584
You weigh the pros and the cons,
and I'll be in touch.

00:50.668 --> 00:52.836
Three motorcyclists pulled me out of the car.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.340
They said they're coming after you.
They're coming after all of us.

00:56.423 --> 00:59.426
How many motorcycles in Pittsburgh?
I need to look it up.

00:59.468 --> 01:01.262
- Who are you talking to?
- Dad.

01:13.732 --> 01:16.402
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:16.485 --> 01:19.280
<i># Little boxes made of ticky-tacky</i>

01:19.363 --> 01:21.740
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:21.824 --> 01:24.451
<i># Little boxes all the same</i>

01:24.535 --> 01:26.871
<i># There's a green one and a pink one</i>

01:26.954 --> 01:29.623
<i># And a blue one and a yellow one</i>

01:29.707 --> 01:32.293
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

01:32.376 --> 01:35.129
<i># And they all look just the same</i>

01:36.297 --> 01:38.924
<i># And the people in the houses</i>

01:39.049 --> 01:41.844
<i># All went to the university</i>

01:41.927 --> 01:44.263
<i># Where they were put in boxes</i>

01:44.346 --> 01:46.807
<i># And they came out all the same</i>

01:46.891 --> 01:49.560
<i># And there's doctors and lawyers</i>

01:49.643 --> 01:52.229
<i># And business executives</i>

01:52.313 --> 01:54.899
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

01:54.982 --> 01:59.111
<i># And they all look just the same #</i>

02:01.989 --> 02:03.616
<i>We've got to hit them back.</i>

02:03.699 --> 02:05.701
No way we can let them
get away with this shit.

02:05.784 --> 02:09.371
OK. Calm down.
Let's get you looked at first.

02:10.872 --> 02:12.917
How's that arm doing?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.961
- Hurts like shit.
- No, try not to move it so much.

02:19.298 --> 02:23.010
- OK. Either of you armed?
- Broken-armed.

02:23.093 --> 02:25.804
I'm going to need a $500 cash deposit.

02:25.888 --> 02:29.600
We only accept American currency,
and we no longer barter.

02:30.601 --> 02:32.519
- Good old American green.
- Mm-hm.

02:34.396 --> 02:37.274
OK. Dr Tupelo will see you now.

02:39.526 --> 02:42.905
- He's gonna be fine, right?
- How much can you move the arm?

02:44.031 --> 02:45.491
Not broken.

02:46.242 --> 02:50.037
And the head wound,
it looks a lot worse than it is.

02:50.120 --> 02:52.581
Don't you want to x-ray him or something?

02:52.665 --> 02:55.501
If you'd like a second opinion,
I could call my buddy at Cedars.

02:55.584 --> 02:58.420
He'll order up an MRI,
it'll run you at least 10 grand,

02:58.504 --> 02:59.922
and he'll tell you the same thing.

03:00.005 --> 03:02.466
The system's broke, I'm working outside of it.

03:02.550 --> 03:05.928
I hear you. How can we call ourselves
a first-world country?

03:06.011 --> 03:09.640
I mean, we can't even provide
basic healthcare for our criminals.

03:10.307 --> 03:11.308
Argh!

03:11.392 --> 03:14.937
- How deep is that cut?
- Six or seven stitches.

03:15.020 --> 03:18.148
And I'm out of Demerol.
Now, I'm gonna give you a topical.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.484
A topical? Are you kidding me?

03:20.568 --> 03:24.113
Your boy looks like a tough young man.
He can handle it.

03:24.196 --> 03:27.074
I'm fine. Just do it.

03:30.953 --> 03:32.454
I remember you.

03:33.497 --> 03:35.791
You came in with U-Turn and Marvin.

03:36.667 --> 03:38.252
I might have.

03:38.794 --> 03:42.339
Yeah, it took me forever to find
that tiny little bullet

03:42.423 --> 03:44.592
in the middle of that big fat ass.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.261
Charged him double.

03:47.344 --> 03:51.599
Yeah, well, I'm hoping for a discount,
since we're foregoing the painkillers.

03:51.682 --> 03:55.060
Still got to charge you
for parts and labour, honey.

03:55.144 --> 03:57.605
Any chance you're a shrink, too?

04:03.819 --> 04:06.238
- Is Judah here right now?
- Yeah.

04:07.907 --> 04:09.909
- Where is he?
- Behind you.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.746
- I don't know why I did that.
- Because he's behind you.

04:13.829 --> 04:16.290
- I don't see him.
- He sees you.

04:17.625 --> 04:22.296
Did you catch The Sixth Sense on cable?
"Do you see dead people?"

04:22.379 --> 04:24.924
- Am I dead? Jesus.
- No, you're alive.

04:25.007 --> 04:26.967
- OK.
- What?

04:27.051 --> 04:29.345
I didn't say anything.

04:29.428 --> 04:31.847
- You tell him.
- Tell who?

04:31.931 --> 04:34.475
Dad wants to say something to you.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.352
What?

04:39.438 --> 04:41.649
Why don't you answer him?

04:42.274 --> 04:43.484
- Answer who?
- Dad.

04:43.609 --> 04:46.779
Shane, if you're putting us on,

04:46.862 --> 04:50.366
I give you all the credit in the world
for fully committing to this.

04:50.449 --> 04:53.077
Kudos. All right. Bravo.

04:53.160 --> 04:56.205
- Answer Dad.
- Fine, what's he saying?

04:57.331 --> 05:02.169
He wants to know why you let Mom down.
Why you didn't take better care of all of us.

05:13.430 --> 05:14.723
That's bullshit.

05:14.807 --> 05:18.018
There must be like a million ways
we can get those biker assholes.

05:18.102 --> 05:22.815
I have no muscle. I have no army.
I'm in heels, for Christ's sake.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.317
What the hell does that mean?

05:25.401 --> 05:28.696
OK, Shane's not pretending.

05:29.363 --> 05:33.325
He actually thinks he's talking to Judah.
It's very Stephen King.

05:33.409 --> 05:36.495
- Where is he now?
- He's upstairs with Judah.

05:36.579 --> 05:38.831
After hearing what Judah's been saying to him,

05:38.914 --> 05:43.002
I'm starting to think he might actually
be communicating with the other side.

05:43.085 --> 05:46.672
Weird things happen
when these Santa Ana winds start blowing.

05:46.755 --> 05:49.717
No. Andy, help me out here.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.261
- What the hell am I gonna do?
- Take him to a shrink.

05:52.344 --> 05:55.055
Should have done it years ago.
He's fucking nuts.

05:55.139 --> 05:58.559
Go put ice on your bruises
like Dr. Tupelo told you to.

05:58.684 --> 06:01.604
Taking him to a shrink isn't a bad idea.

06:01.687 --> 06:05.316
Oh, no? What if he starts talking about
what his mommy does for a living?

06:05.399 --> 06:07.818
So, we just tell him to lie.

06:07.902 --> 06:11.155
Wait, I guess that defeats the purpose.

06:11.196 --> 06:15.034
Why does everything
have to blow up simultaneously? It's not fair.

06:15.784 --> 06:19.496
- Things could be worse, you could be pregnant.
- Bite your motherfucking tongue.

06:19.580 --> 06:23.918
Relax. How could you be pregnant?
It's not like you're getting any.

06:25.294 --> 06:26.670
- Or are you?
- Shut up.

06:26.754 --> 06:29.381
- Are you? Are you?
- Shut up. Quit it.

06:32.176 --> 06:33.510
Are you?

06:34.136 --> 06:35.554
Thank you.

06:37.264 --> 06:38.641
Hi, there.

06:40.851 --> 06:43.062
I'd like to make a deposit.

06:46.232 --> 06:49.735
- $15,000?
- It's been a good month.

06:50.694 --> 06:53.948
- Fill these out. Bring them back.
- What are they for?

06:54.031 --> 06:55.199
Well, one's for the IRS,

06:55.282 --> 06:59.119
which demands we report
any deposit over $10,000 in cash.

06:59.161 --> 07:04.333
The other's for the bank, we keep internal
records of any deposit in cash over $5,000.

07:06.710 --> 07:09.255
I'm not sure...

07:10.047 --> 07:11.757
I counted right.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.677
Thank you.

07:14.802 --> 07:15.803
My slip.

07:22.893 --> 07:25.187
Hello? Sullivan Groff speaking.

07:25.688 --> 07:30.192
<i>If you want to see your cross
again, you better listen and do the right thing.</i>

07:30.276 --> 07:32.069
<i>- Who is this?
- It doesn't matter.</i>

07:32.152 --> 07:37.324
<i>What matters is you make right
on all the promises you made to certain people.</i>

07:37.408 --> 07:39.994
Wilson, you piece of shit.

07:42.788 --> 07:45.499
Shit. Fucking Radio Barn!

07:45.583 --> 07:47.835
Shit. Shit.

08:01.724 --> 08:03.142
Ah.

08:04.143 --> 08:05.311
Of course.

08:05.394 --> 08:08.856
We done planting, and rent ain't due
for another couple of weeks,

08:08.939 --> 08:10.024
so what you doing here?

08:10.065 --> 08:15.404
I need to know what you do
with all of your drug money.

08:15.487 --> 08:17.448
I never realised how useless cash is.

08:17.531 --> 08:21.076
Can't deposit it in the bank,
can't pay my bills with it,

08:21.160 --> 08:24.788
and my family is not going
to get their hands on it. Uh-uh-uh.

08:24.872 --> 08:29.251
Sorry, I ain't training another white girl
in the ways of the drug business.

08:29.335 --> 08:31.921
Didn't turn out too good for me last time.

08:32.004 --> 08:33.839
I'm your landlord.

08:33.923 --> 08:36.299
And if I can't handle all of this cash,

08:36.383 --> 08:41.138
well, there's just no incentive to rent to you.

08:41.222 --> 08:42.972
Lord, help me.

08:44.767 --> 08:45.935
Fine.

08:46.644 --> 08:49.730
First off, you take out 20% and you hide it.

08:50.564 --> 08:53.817
Furniture cushions, floorboards,
up your snatch if you gotta.

08:53.859 --> 08:58.322
Never know when you're gonna need it.
No, trust me. It's your savings account.

08:58.405 --> 09:03.536
Now, it don't earn no interest, but there's nothing
like cold hard cash when fate comes calling.

09:04.495 --> 09:06.705
OK, well, what about the other 80%?

09:06.789 --> 09:09.583
Take the rest, and you start a company.

09:09.667 --> 09:11.710
What kind of company?

09:12.378 --> 09:15.297
You know what,
why don't you find yourself an accountant

09:15.381 --> 09:18.968
that don't mind bending the rules
and let him take care of it for you?

09:19.051 --> 09:20.386
OK.

09:24.515 --> 09:26.976
You gonna leave me to my reading?

09:27.059 --> 09:28.727
Do you ever get scared?

09:28.811 --> 09:32.773
- About anything in particular?
- Getting caught.

09:32.856 --> 09:36.902
Oh, no. You gotta put that out your mind.
It's like flying.

09:37.987 --> 09:41.824
Sure, the plane might crash,
but you got to get to where you're going fast.

09:41.907 --> 09:44.535
So in the end, it's worth the risk.

09:50.040 --> 09:51.917
We're gonna be friends.

09:57.798 --> 09:59.216
Lord, help me.

10:00.467 --> 10:03.804
- What does he say to you?
- He likes the way you wear your hair now.

10:05.014 --> 10:06.557
He does?

10:10.019 --> 10:11.604
But he's angry.

10:11.896 --> 10:14.440
- At who?
- All of us.

10:15.357 --> 10:17.234
- He is, is he?
- Yeah.

10:18.736 --> 10:23.282
- Well, tell him that's not fair.
- You tell him. He's here.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.075
Shane.

10:29.038 --> 10:31.665
No, he's not.

10:32.666 --> 10:36.420
He's dead. You saw him. You were there.

10:37.922 --> 10:41.634
Please, don't do this anymore.
It's making me really sad.

10:41.717 --> 10:44.845
Why? Don't you love him?

10:47.640 --> 10:50.226
I'll always love the memory of him.

10:55.522 --> 10:58.108
- What?
- He said he still loves you.

10:59.360 --> 11:04.406
- Shane, this is you talking, isn't it?
- No, it's not.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.124
Don't be mad at me.

11:14.208 --> 11:17.461
I'm not mad. I'm just scared.

11:22.174 --> 11:23.592
She's mad.

11:37.815 --> 11:40.985
- Can I help you?
- Oh.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.236
Oh?

11:42.319 --> 11:47.533
- Oh. Hello. I'm Eve Meriweather.
- Good for you.

11:47.616 --> 11:51.203
I'm going door to door. We're trying
to mobilise the entire neighbourhood

11:51.287 --> 11:54.790
- to keep an eye out for suspicious behaviour.
- Suspicious behaviour?

11:54.874 --> 11:57.084
You haven't seen anything strange, have you?

11:57.167 --> 11:59.837
- No, I can't say that I have.
- Are you sure?

11:59.920 --> 12:01.964
What is it I'm supposed to be
looking out for?

12:02.047 --> 12:04.884
Oh, why our cross, of course.

12:08.304 --> 12:11.098
- Someone stole your cross?
- Yes.

12:11.181 --> 12:14.018
That is a damn shame.
Who would do something like that?

12:14.101 --> 12:16.478
Jews.

12:16.562 --> 12:19.773
Well, I haven't seen it.
Haven't seen many Jews around here, either.

12:19.857 --> 12:21.901
Well, they're mostly urban.

12:22.401 --> 12:24.737
- You're new here.
- Just moved in.

12:25.905 --> 12:30.159
- Oh! And you must be the wife.
- And you must be...

12:30.242 --> 12:35.372
Eve Meriweather. Well, look at him.
Hello, baby.

12:35.456 --> 12:36.957
Ah!

12:36.999 --> 12:41.378
Why are little black babies
always so adorable?

12:41.462 --> 12:44.089
Why are white babies always so ugly?

12:46.717 --> 12:48.969
- Sense of humour.
- Ha!

12:49.053 --> 12:50.804
Well, thank you for dropping by,

12:50.888 --> 12:54.600
and, yes, if I see your cross,
I will call the number.

12:56.435 --> 13:01.398
- See you all in church, I hope.
- Sure. Church. Praise the Lord.

13:01.482 --> 13:02.942
Hallelujah.

13:06.362 --> 13:09.990
- I hate white idiots.
- White idiots named Doug.

13:20.584 --> 13:23.754
Celia.

13:25.047 --> 13:29.635
- To what do I owe this horror?
- All right, save it. I'm here on business.

13:29.718 --> 13:32.805
I need a slimy, crooked accountant
with no scruples

13:32.888 --> 13:37.101
who will do anything to make a buck, and,
unfortunately, you're the only one I know.

13:37.184 --> 13:40.854
What makes you think
I would lift a finger to help you?

13:46.944 --> 13:48.153
How can I help you?

13:48.237 --> 13:52.366
You can set up a dummy corporation
for me to funnel cash through.

13:52.449 --> 13:55.578
- You did it for Nancy.
- I like Nancy.

13:55.661 --> 13:58.664
Yeah, everybody likes Nancy.
Everybody hates Celia.

13:58.747 --> 14:00.875
Time to come up with a new narrative.

14:00.958 --> 14:05.629
- We like the old narrative, it felt right.
- Tough. I'm not on the outside anymore.

14:05.713 --> 14:10.050
I am part of this operation
whether anyone likes it or not.

14:10.134 --> 14:12.303
And I intend to get my fair share.

14:17.850 --> 14:18.851
What?

14:20.644 --> 14:23.689
I really want to have sex
with you right now.

14:23.939 --> 14:25.691
You do?

14:27.568 --> 14:31.363
I guess I must have
some sort of a castrating bitch fetish.

14:31.447 --> 14:32.781
Yeah?

14:33.574 --> 14:36.577
I'm really hard. Feel.

14:38.245 --> 14:39.246
Oh.

14:43.375 --> 14:44.627
Don't waste it on me.

14:44.710 --> 14:48.088
I'd sooner lose a leg
than suck your dick again.

14:48.172 --> 14:52.551
Set up the corporation fast.
I have major bills to pay.

14:52.635 --> 14:56.889
Ooh. Hey! You are working for me now.

14:56.972 --> 15:01.101
- How about Ball Busters Inc?
- Yeah, whatever. Work it out, bitch.

15:09.652 --> 15:11.737
What are we waiting for?

15:12.613 --> 15:15.824
- Where did you get this?
- Conrad had it at the grow house.

15:15.908 --> 15:18.202
- Does he know you took it?
- No.

15:19.954 --> 15:23.666
We can't just stand around and do nothing.
They'll just hit us again.

15:23.749 --> 15:26.669
- Let me worry about it.
- You didn't get the shit beat out of you.

15:26.752 --> 15:28.587
You're right. I didn't.

15:28.671 --> 15:32.299
I'm also not going up against
an army of drug-dealing bikers

15:32.383 --> 15:37.221
with a 17-year-old boy,
a flamboyant Hindi queen,

15:37.304 --> 15:41.225
and a four-foot-tall
Jesus-loving pixie as my posse.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.602
So what do we do, then?
They won't let us deal.

15:43.686 --> 15:47.481
We can't sell their shitty ditch weed.
We're out of options.

15:48.649 --> 15:50.985
- I'll think of something.
- You better do it fast,

15:51.068 --> 15:53.279
because the next crop
of MILF is almost ready.

15:53.362 --> 15:57.408
Don't you have other things to do,
go to the mall or something, be normal?

15:57.491 --> 16:00.619
Like it or not, this is a family business now.

16:00.703 --> 16:05.082
- Then let the head of the family worry about it.
- The head of the family's dead.

16:05.165 --> 16:07.376
At least that isn't my fault.

16:12.047 --> 16:14.425
<i>When Chess is mad,
he does stupid things.</i>

16:14.508 --> 16:18.345
Beating the shit
out of a defenceless teenage kid is psycho.

16:18.429 --> 16:22.474
Well, unfortunately, there's not much
I can do to stop him. Never has been.

16:22.558 --> 16:26.604
Then what the hell am I doing here?
I never wash my van.

16:27.313 --> 16:30.149
- You're here because of me.
- No, no, no, no.

16:30.232 --> 16:32.484
This Romeo and Juliet shit
isn't working for me,

16:32.568 --> 16:35.738
not if there isn't anything you can do
to stop him.

16:35.821 --> 16:37.448
I tried.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.911
- I really did.
- No, you tell your brother,

16:42.036 --> 16:45.873
if he ever touches anyone
in my family again, I will kill him.

16:53.589 --> 16:55.633
OK, maybe don't pass that message along,

16:55.716 --> 16:59.261
but just know in your heart,
his behaviour is unacceptable.

17:01.847 --> 17:03.807
- Call me?
- Yeah, maybe.

17:15.109 --> 17:16.987
You here for a date?

17:17.195 --> 17:18.489
No.

17:19.656 --> 17:20.991
No date.

17:28.082 --> 17:29.083
Er...

17:30.584 --> 17:33.546
- I need help.
- You try Home Depot?

17:33.629 --> 17:37.633
- Plenty of Mexicans there that can help you.
- Not that kind of help.

17:37.716 --> 17:39.760
I'm being shaken down by bikers in the hills.

17:39.843 --> 17:42.763
- Yeah? I know them.
- You know them?

17:42.846 --> 17:46.225
Señorita, I know everybody
who tries to peddle shit in sunny L.A.

17:46.308 --> 17:51.063
And I mean shit. They grow garbage.
They are garbage.

17:52.648 --> 17:55.734
They beat up my son.
They're threatening me.

17:56.485 --> 17:58.696
So what do you want from me?

17:59.738 --> 18:00.948
Protection.

18:01.031 --> 18:04.285
And what do I get in return
for this protection?

18:06.120 --> 18:08.539
My undying gratitude?

18:10.499 --> 18:14.545
How about in return we're partners?

18:14.628 --> 18:17.590
- What kind of partners?
- 50-50 partners.

18:17.673 --> 18:19.550
- Half?
- Of everything.

18:23.262 --> 18:27.558
- Can I think about it and get back to you?
- No, you cannot. Yes or no.

18:27.641 --> 18:29.727
Deal or no deal. Ahora.

18:31.896 --> 18:35.649
What kind of protection would I get
for half of everything?

18:36.859 --> 18:40.404
You get total protection.
No more shakedowns.

18:40.487 --> 18:46.076
Anyone fucks with you, they fuck with me.
When they go down, they go down hard.

18:48.204 --> 18:50.247
- Fine.
- Good.

18:51.165 --> 18:55.502
You don't got to worry about
those biker pendejos anymore.

18:55.544 --> 18:57.630
I'll take care of them.

18:57.713 --> 19:00.883
- What are you gonna do?
- Don't you worry, chelita.

19:07.097 --> 19:10.768
- What if they come after me?
- They ain't gonna come after you.

19:10.851 --> 19:14.021
They're gonna be thanking Jesús Cristo
they're still breathing.

19:14.104 --> 19:18.901
Then they're gonna get on those ridiculous
maricon bikes that they ride

19:18.984 --> 19:20.694
and head to Canada.

19:20.778 --> 19:23.906
Then word's gonna spread
that you're being protected by me,

19:23.989 --> 19:28.202
and that's gonna allow you
to conduct your business in peace.

19:28.285 --> 19:30.329
I could use a little peace.

19:31.705 --> 19:33.457
You'll have it.

19:35.167 --> 19:39.421
And you tell your son,
no one's ever gonna mess with him again.

19:59.650 --> 20:02.111
I believe this belongs to you.

20:03.153 --> 20:06.490
You might want to try
and hide it a little better next time.

20:06.574 --> 20:08.951
- How you get it?
- Silas took it.

20:11.453 --> 20:15.457
He wanted me to use it
to blow the bikers away.

20:16.834 --> 20:19.128
Like your hero U-Turn?

20:19.211 --> 20:23.716
- Silas got a tattoo on his ass, too?
- Will you let that go already?

20:23.799 --> 20:27.011
Jealous Conrad, so not sexy.

20:27.094 --> 20:30.806
Should I be carrying this on me?
What's going on with said bikers?

20:30.890 --> 20:32.725
It's taken care of.

20:36.645 --> 20:39.815
- I went and bought some protection.
- From who?

20:41.942 --> 20:45.196
- Guillermo.
- So we working for Guillermo now?

20:45.654 --> 20:49.867
God damn, girl! You realise
you just trading one gangster for another?

20:49.950 --> 20:53.454
Yes. I also realise that I have no choice.

20:53.495 --> 20:56.999
These things are gonna
keep happening to me.

20:57.082 --> 21:01.879
If I don't have any muscle behind me,
I won't be able to do my business.

21:01.962 --> 21:06.467
Like it or not, I'm a drug dealer.

21:08.177 --> 21:11.722
There, I said it out loud.
I'm a fucking drug dealer.

21:12.765 --> 21:15.976
- How much he ask?
- Half.

21:17.561 --> 21:20.397
- Half?
- I let my son be a part of this.

21:20.481 --> 21:23.734
And I couldn't protect him, it was my fault.

21:23.817 --> 21:25.861
I did what I had to do to protect my family.

21:25.945 --> 21:28.781
- And who protects us from Guillermo?
- I can handle Guillermo.

21:28.864 --> 21:30.991
How, by fucking him?

21:33.410 --> 21:36.163
That was so not fair.

21:44.838 --> 21:47.633
It's just that we in this together now.

21:49.510 --> 21:50.844
You.

21:55.641 --> 21:57.184
And me.

22:01.021 --> 22:03.148
And your boy Guillermo.

22:11.824 --> 22:15.035
Ain't this the fucking shit?

22:17.496 --> 22:19.665
The two Garys up in the bird did some flyovers

22:19.748 --> 22:22.501
with the thermal-imaging camera,
got some sweet shots.

22:22.585 --> 22:24.879
- Anything sexy?
- Two meth labs.

22:25.462 --> 22:28.757
If the Patriot Act had tits, I'd buy it a steak.

22:28.841 --> 22:31.427
Wait. Go back one.

22:34.013 --> 22:35.389
Zoom in.

22:37.474 --> 22:38.767
Closer.

22:42.229 --> 22:43.689
- Who you calling?
- Majestic.

22:43.772 --> 22:47.401
I read an article in the paper
about this cross of theirs that got stolen.

22:47.484 --> 22:49.445
- I think I just found it.
- Not our problem.

22:49.528 --> 22:52.698
It's called moral duty.

22:52.781 --> 22:57.411
- Where's your respect for the Lord?
- Whose Lord we talking about? Not mine.

22:57.494 --> 23:01.540
If you ask me a cross that size
is for a lord with a tiny dick.

23:07.296 --> 23:09.340
- What's going on?
- Fire.

23:10.466 --> 23:13.886
- That's a big one. Where is it?
- Here.

23:13.969 --> 23:17.723
It started in the foothills. Then it jumped
the highway and now it's right here.

23:19.516 --> 23:21.769
<i>The Santa Ana winds
aren't helping matters.</i>

23:21.852 --> 23:25.773
<i>At this moment, the fire department
is issuing voluntary evacuation orders...</i>

23:25.856 --> 23:30.569
Denise just called,
said the fire started in their grow field.

23:30.653 --> 23:32.696
Someone torched it.

23:33.531 --> 23:37.660
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about that, would you?

23:39.954 --> 23:41.455
What are we gonna do?

23:41.539 --> 23:44.333
- Does that mean we have to leave?
- What about the grow house?

23:44.416 --> 23:47.086
Nance, any ideas?

23:48.170 --> 23:52.424
Shane, ask Judah
if he has any suggestions.

23:54.677 --> 23:57.137
<i># You know some people,
they just won't understand</i>

23:57.221 --> 24:00.558
<i># No, just won't understand
these things</i>

24:01.684 --> 24:04.728
<i># Thank you for your message
but I don't understand</i>

24:04.812 --> 24:08.190
<i># No, just don't understand
these things</i>

24:09.233 --> 24:12.236
<i># You know some people,
they just won't understand</i>

24:12.319 --> 24:15.698
<i># No, just won't understand

24:16.740 --> 24:19.660
<i># Thank you for your message
but I don't understand</i>

24:19.785 --> 24:22.663
<i># No, I just won't understand
these things #</i>
