01:55.040 --> 01:56.910
- Mr. Szpilman?
- Hello.

01:57.120 --> 01:59.620
I came specially to meet you.
I love your playing.

01:59.750 --> 02:03.710
- Who are you?
- My name's Dorota, Jurek's sister.

02:03.880 --> 02:06.420
- You're bleeding!
- It's nothing.

02:06.590 --> 02:10.591
You can write him a fan letter later.
This isn't the best time. Come on.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.351
Jurek, where have you been
hiding her?

02:17.391 --> 02:20.311
- I don't know what to take.
- You always take too much.

02:21.691 --> 02:24.611
How many suitcases are you taking?

02:24.821 --> 02:27.821
What do you think, should I take
uncle Szymon's portrait?

02:28.491 --> 02:31.162
Take it, don't take it,
take what you like.

02:31.322 --> 02:33.782
Can't you see I'm worried sick?

02:33.992 --> 02:35.742
He'll come home, he'll be alright.

02:35.952 --> 02:39.922
- I should have another case.
- Mama, Wladek is home!

02:40.422 --> 02:44.422
Thank God.
Wladek! You're wounded?

02:44.592 --> 02:47.762
- No, it was nothing.
- I've been worried sick.

02:47.962 --> 02:50.512
I told her not to worry.
You had your papers on you.

02:50.682 --> 02:52.592
If you'd been hit by a bomb,
they'd know where to take you.

02:52.972 --> 02:57.853
Henryk, don't say things like that.
God forbid. God forbid.

02:58.063 --> 03:00.103
- Papa, Wladek is home.
- What did I tell you?

03:00.313 --> 03:03.733
- What are you doing?
- Where's my hat with the wide brim?

03:04.153 --> 03:08.653
- They've bombed us. We're off the air.
- Warsaw is not the only radio station.

03:08.863 --> 03:10.703
Pack, darling.
Get your things packed.

03:10.903 --> 03:12.953
- Where are we going?
- Out of Warsaw.

03:13.163 --> 03:15.783
- Out of Warsaw where?
- You haven't heard?

03:15.993 --> 03:18.624
- Heard what?
- Haven't you seen the paper?

03:18.834 --> 03:21.334
- Where's the paper?
- I used it for packing.

03:21.544 --> 03:24.044
- She used it for packing.
- The government has moved to Lublin.

03:24.174 --> 03:28.674
All men must leave the city, go across
the river, set up a new line of defense.

03:28.884 --> 03:32.804
There isn't anybody left here, only
the women. The men are all gone.

03:33.014 --> 03:35.644
What do you think you'll do while
they set up a new line of defense?

03:35.854 --> 03:39.144
- Wonder around with your suitcases?
- Pack, Wladek. There's no time.

03:39.354 --> 03:43.145
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Good. I'm not going anywhere either.

03:43.315 --> 03:45.985
Don't be ridiculous,
we've got to keep together.

03:46.195 --> 03:49.535
Look. If I'm going to die, I prefer to
die in my own home, staying put.

03:49.695 --> 03:53.615
- God forbid.
- Shut up, I've got something. Listen.

03:53.785 --> 03:57.995
...from the BBC in London.
The British government...

03:58.545 --> 04:02.545
having received no reply
to the observations presented...

04:02.755 --> 04:05.005
to the German government...

04:05.215 --> 04:09.176
has declared war on nazi Germany.

04:09.676 --> 04:13.136
- That's wonderful! Wonderful!
- It is expected that...

04:18.016 --> 04:23.236
...within the next few hours, France
will make a similar declaration.

04:23.396 --> 04:26.816
Poland is no longer alone.

04:31.997 --> 04:34.247
Wonderful, wonderful!

04:35.867 --> 04:39.877
- Mama, that was a great dinner.
- It certainly was.

04:40.087 --> 04:42.587
When there's something to celebrate,
you've got to make an effort.

04:42.797 --> 04:45.757
Here's to Great Britain and France!

04:46.297 --> 04:49.757
Didn't I tell you? Didn't I tell you?
All will be well.

05:23.299 --> 05:25.219
Five thousand and three.

05:26.759 --> 05:30.549
- Is that all?
- Yes. It's all we've got left.

05:30.759 --> 05:33.929
- It's 3,003 too much.
- Look.

05:34.139 --> 05:37.519
"Further restrictions
regarding liquid assets.

05:37.689 --> 05:40.939
Jews will be allowed to keep a
maximum of 2,000 zlotys at home. "

05:41.359 --> 05:45.650
- What do we do with the rest?
- Deposit it in a bank. Blocked account.

05:45.820 --> 05:49.610
Banks! Who'd be stupid enough
to deposit money in a German bank?

05:49.780 --> 05:54.450
We could hide the money. Look here.
We can hide it under the flowerpots.

05:54.660 --> 05:57.710
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll use try and tested methods.

05:57.910 --> 06:00.330
You know what we did
in the last war?

06:00.670 --> 06:04.420
We made a hole in the table leg,
and hid the money in there.

06:04.630 --> 06:07.091
- Suppose they take the table away?
- What do you mean?

06:07.261 --> 06:11.891
Germans go into Jewish homes and
take furniture, valuables, anything.

06:12.101 --> 06:14.891
- Do they?
- Why'd they want a table like this?

06:16.221 --> 06:19.141
- What on earth are you doing?
- Listen. Look.

06:19.441 --> 06:23.441
This is the best place. No-one would
think of looking under the flowerpot.

06:23.651 --> 06:26.781
- No, listen. I've been thinking...
- Really? That's a change.

06:26.991 --> 06:30.282
- You know what? We use psychology.
- We use what?

06:30.492 --> 06:35.412
We leave the money and the watch
on the table, covered. In full view.

06:38.252 --> 06:41.172
- Are you stupid?
- The Germans will never notice it.

06:41.372 --> 06:45.302
That's the stupidest thing I've ever
seen. Of course they'll notice. Look.

06:45.922 --> 06:47.882
Look here.

06:48.382 --> 06:49.972
Idiot.

06:50.342 --> 06:53.013
- And you call me stupid.
- Very good. That's the last place...

06:53.223 --> 06:55.313
- This would take hours.
- We're not in a hurry.

06:55.513 --> 06:58.733
- It won't take hours.
- How will you get them out? Tell me.

06:58.933 --> 07:01.983
- How will you get them out?
- Quiet! Order, please!

07:02.153 --> 07:04.903
- You reach them out individually.
- No-one listens to me!

07:05.113 --> 07:07.943
Quiet, please, quiet.
Order, order, please.

07:08.153 --> 07:12.413
- The lawyer, she likes order.
- Listen, just listen. Look.

07:12.613 --> 07:16.203
The watch we put under the flowerpot
and the money we stuff in the violin.

07:18.254 --> 07:22.874
- But I'll still be able to play?
- You'll find out.

07:23.084 --> 07:26.844
- Jurek? It's Wladek Szpilman.
- Wladek, how are you?

07:27.594 --> 07:29.094
We're fine, thank you.
And you?

07:30.264 --> 07:34.554
Fine, under the circumstances.
I guess I know why you're calling.

07:34.724 --> 07:38.934
There's nothing we can do.
They won't reopen the station.

07:39.144 --> 07:43.905
- Yes, I know, but I...
- No music, no radio for the Polish.

07:44.105 --> 07:47.405
But sure you'll find work.
A pianist like you.

07:47.615 --> 07:50.035
Maybe, maybe not, but...

07:50.615 --> 07:55.375
don't be offended, but I didn't call
to discuss my future carrier.

07:55.575 --> 07:58.795
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks,
and at last he gave in and said...

07:58.995 --> 08:02.165
"All right, come with me tomorrow",
so I came and...

08:02.375 --> 08:04.756
they bombed the station.

08:05.216 --> 08:08.466
- Meeting you like that was wonderful.
- Really?

08:08.676 --> 08:12.136
Yes, it was unforgettable.

08:12.976 --> 08:15.936
- I love your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
- Call me Wladek, please.

08:16.146 --> 08:19.396
- No-one plays Chopin like you.
- I hope it's a compliment.

08:19.566 --> 08:23.276
- Of course, I mean it.
- I was... trying to be funny.

08:24.106 --> 08:27.776
- Should we go and have a coffee?
- I'd like that.

08:29.237 --> 08:33.077
- And you, what do you do?
- I finished with the conservatoire.

08:33.287 --> 08:36.246
- You're a musician?
- Yes. But only just.

08:36.457 --> 08:39.037
- What instrument?
- The cello.

08:39.246 --> 08:41.837
I love to see women
playing the cello.

08:44.547 --> 08:46.257
JEWS FORBIDDEN

08:46.467 --> 08:49.717
This is disgraceful.
How dare they?

08:49.927 --> 08:52.768
You know what people are like, they
want to be better nazis than Hitler.

08:52.968 --> 08:56.848
- I'm going in there to complain.
- It's better not, believe me.

08:57.058 --> 09:00.358
- It's humiliating. Someone like you!
- Good-bye.

09:04.688 --> 09:07.158
We'll find somewhere else.

09:07.318 --> 09:10.658
- We can walk in the park.
- No, we can't.

09:10.868 --> 09:14.198
Official decree.
No Jews allowed in the park.

09:15.038 --> 09:17.539
- My God. Are you joking?
- I'm not joking, it's true.

09:17.749 --> 09:22.629
We could sit in a bench, but
"no Jews allowed on public benches".

09:22.839 --> 09:24.669
This is absurd.

09:24.879 --> 09:30.799
We can just stand here and talk.
I think we're allowed to do that.

09:31.679 --> 09:36.349
So, you play the cello. That's nice.
And who's your favorite composer?

09:36.559 --> 09:38.899
Chopin? Really? Well...

09:39.059 --> 09:42.020
you'll have to learn to play
his cello sonata, won't you?

09:42.230 --> 09:44.360
What about you, Wladek?

09:44.940 --> 09:47.530
Perhaps I could accompany.
Me on the piano, you on the cello.

09:47.740 --> 09:52.080
Mr. Szpilman, you're quite,
quite wonderful.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.370
Call me Wladek, please.

09:56.580 --> 10:00.250
"Free emblems for Jews
in the Warsaw district.

10:00.420 --> 10:03.380
I hereby order that all Jews
in the Warsaw district...

10:03.591 --> 10:06.841
will wear visible emblems
when out of doors.

10:07.051 --> 10:11.891
This decree will come into force
on the first of December, 1939...

10:12.101 --> 10:15.521
and applies to all Jews
over 12 years of age.

10:15.891 --> 10:19.101
The emblem will be worn
on the right sleeve...

10:19.311 --> 10:23.061
and will represent the blue star
of David on a white background.

10:23.771 --> 10:26.781
The background must be
sufficiently large...

10:26.941 --> 10:30.742
for the star to measure eight
centimeters from point to point.

10:31.322 --> 10:35.452
The width of the arms of the star
must be one centimeter.

10:35.662 --> 10:41.002
The Jews that do not respect this
decree will be severely punished.

10:41.172 --> 10:46.002
Governor of the Warsaw district,
Dr. Fischer. "

10:49.132 --> 10:53.473
- I won't wear it.
- I'm not going to be branded.

10:57.273 --> 10:59.563
Let me see this.

11:03.443 --> 11:07.693
Does it say that we have to provide
these armbands ourselves?

11:08.323 --> 11:12.663
- Where will we get them?
- We're not going to wear them.

11:21.714 --> 11:23.584
You!

11:24.714 --> 11:26.804
Come here.

11:32.974 --> 11:35.104
Why haven't you greeted us?

11:36.264 --> 11:38.184
I'm sorry.

11:48.905 --> 11:51.495
The sidewalk is forbidden for you.

11:51.955 --> 11:53.785
Go to the gutter.

12:10.176 --> 12:14.136
- Have you seen this?
- What? What? I'm working. What?

12:15.896 --> 12:17.436
What is this?

12:18.766 --> 12:22.356
- It's where they're going to put us.
- What do you mean "put us"?

12:24.776 --> 12:28.487
"By order of the governor of the
Warsaw district, Dr. Fischer...

12:28.697 --> 12:32.367
concerning the establishment of
the Jewish district in Warsaw.

12:32.577 --> 12:38.207
There'll be created a Jewish district
in which Jews will have to reside. "

12:39.087 --> 12:42.917
Look here. "Jews living outside
of the prescribed area...

12:43.127 --> 12:48.427
will have to move to the Jewish
district by 31 of October, 1940."

12:49.677 --> 12:51.848
They won't get all of us.
It's too small.

12:52.058 --> 12:54.058
There's 400 thousand of us
in Warsaw.

12:54.308 --> 12:57.808
No, 360 thousand.
So it will be easy.

12:58.018 --> 13:01.898
What am I supposed to do?
You tell me.

13:05.448 --> 13:07.448
Mama?

13:08.158 --> 13:10.738
Mama, what is it?

13:12.788 --> 13:15.329
20 zlotys!

13:15.539 --> 13:18.789
That's all we have left, 20 zlotys.

13:21.379 --> 13:25.549
What can I buy with 20 zlotys?

13:26.509 --> 13:30.219
I'm sick of cooking potatoes,
potatoes, potatoes.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.900
That's the price.
That's what I'm offering.

13:41.060 --> 13:43.820
My advice is to accept.
You won't get more from anyone else.

13:44.030 --> 13:47.950
- But it's a Bechstein!
- 2 thousand. My advice is to take it.

13:48.360 --> 13:51.160
What are you going to do when
you're hungry? Eat the piano?

13:51.830 --> 13:54.160
- Get out!
- What's the matter with you?

13:54.330 --> 13:56.290
- Stop it!
- We'd rather give it away. Get out!

13:56.500 --> 13:59.670
Haven't you eaten today?
What are you suffering from?

14:00.330 --> 14:02.541
You people are crazy.

14:03.171 --> 14:06.761
I'm doing you a favor. Two thousand
and I'm paying for the removal.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.551
I'm not even charging
for the removal!

14:10.681 --> 14:13.011
You haven't eaten today.
You're crazy.

14:13.221 --> 14:15.061
Take it.

14:49.843 --> 14:51.303
Hello.

14:52.723 --> 14:54.763
Hello. Hi.

14:56.893 --> 14:59.183
I didn't want to come.

14:59.393 --> 15:03.983
I didn't want to see all this, but...
I couldn't stop myself.

15:04.193 --> 15:06.113
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

15:06.323 --> 15:08.323
Good.

15:08.533 --> 15:12.203
No, not really.
They arrested my cousin.

15:12.413 --> 15:14.784
Jurek says they'll let him out.

15:16.084 --> 15:20.624
- This is disgraceful.
- It won't last long. Don't worry.

15:20.834 --> 15:23.794
That's what I said myself.

15:24.384 --> 15:26.674
It's too absurd.

15:30.884 --> 15:33.844
I... I should go.

15:35.894 --> 15:38.645
Well, I'll see you...

15:39.315 --> 15:40.605
soon.

15:45.155 --> 15:47.405
Good-bye.

16:01.756 --> 16:03.716
Well...

16:03.876 --> 16:08.006
to tell you the truth,
I thought it would be worse.

16:14.306 --> 16:18.646
- Where will we sleep?
- I sleep in the kitchen with the girls.

16:18.856 --> 16:21.856
You, Henryk and papa, in here.

16:23.446 --> 16:25.407
Look.

16:26.657 --> 16:28.947
Come and look.

17:01.268 --> 17:03.188
Go away.

17:03.358 --> 17:05.647
Go away! Go away!

17:06.698 --> 17:09.907
Papa! Papa!

17:25.628 --> 17:29.219
- Sell anything?
- Just one. Dostoievski, "The Idiot".

17:29.389 --> 17:32.059
- 3 zlotys.
- It's better than yesterday.

17:32.219 --> 17:36.520
Three lousy zlotys. And there are
people there making millions.

17:36.730 --> 17:39.400
- I know.
- You don't know, believe me.

17:39.770 --> 17:43.020
They bribe the guards,
the guards turn a blind eye.

17:43.230 --> 17:48.030
They bring cartloads of food,
tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics.

17:48.240 --> 17:50.030
And the poor are dying all around
and they don't give a damn.

17:50.410 --> 17:54.040
Excuse me, have you seen
my husband, Izaak Szerman?

17:54.790 --> 17:58.460
A tall handsome man,
with a little gray beard.

17:58.670 --> 18:03.211
- I'm afraid not.
- Excuse me. Good-bye.

18:03.421 --> 18:07.091
Sleep well. But if you see him,
write to me, yes?

18:07.971 --> 18:09.341
Izaak Szerman.

18:24.362 --> 18:27.572
Why do we have to have a gentile
street running through our area?

18:27.782 --> 18:29.952
Why can't they go around?

18:30.162 --> 18:33.872
Don't worry. They're about to build
a bridge. Haven't you heard?

18:34.782 --> 18:36.792
A bridge! Those idiots.

18:38.122 --> 18:40.582
The Germans claim to be intelligent.

18:40.752 --> 18:44.292
But do you know what I think?
I think they're totally stupid.

18:44.632 --> 18:47.512
I have a family to feed.
I spend half of my time here...

18:47.713 --> 18:49.973
waiting for them to let us through.

18:50.843 --> 18:53.433
Maybe they think I come here
to listen to the music?

18:53.933 --> 18:58.813
- What is it? Are you in a hurry?
- What's wrong with you?

18:58.983 --> 19:03.313
- Come on, do something.
- Right. Dance!

19:03.613 --> 19:06.273
- Dance!
- Dance!

19:06.483 --> 19:09.403
Come on, come on! Dance!

19:12.664 --> 19:14.454
Very well.

19:14.664 --> 19:16.624
What about you?
Dance with him.

19:18.084 --> 19:22.374
Let's clear the street,
so the Jews can dance.

19:25.674 --> 19:27.964
Come on. And you.

19:34.054 --> 19:35.765
Go on.

19:37.315 --> 19:38.275
Faster!

19:39.985 --> 19:42.145
Come on!

19:43.855 --> 19:44.855
Faster!

19:48.695 --> 19:50.445
Come on!

19:51.325 --> 19:53.955
Faster!

19:56.205 --> 20:00.876
Come on, move! I said faster!
Come on, Jews!

20:01.086 --> 20:04.086
- Keep dancing.
- Dance.

20:22.896 --> 20:24.607
Good, they're here.

20:26.237 --> 20:29.277
Itzak Heller has been
waiting for you.

20:35.497 --> 20:37.037
- What's this about?
- Sit down, have tea.

20:37.247 --> 20:39.707
I'll start lunch
when the girls get here.

20:45.587 --> 20:48.928
- So, what are you doing here?
- He brought cakes.

20:49.098 --> 20:54.768
His father is back in the jewellery
business. He's doing well.

20:57.558 --> 20:59.728
Amazing, jewellery.

21:00.268 --> 21:02.318
- We're recruiting.
- Who is recruiting?

21:02.528 --> 21:04.988
Don't be clever with me.
I'm coming as a friend.

21:05.198 --> 21:07.408
They're bringing Jews in
from all over the country.

21:07.608 --> 21:09.658
Soon there will be half million people
in the ghetto.

21:09.868 --> 21:13.829
- We need more Jewish police.
- More Jewish police!

21:14.039 --> 21:17.539
You want me to beat up Jews
and catch the Gestapo spirit. I see.

21:18.119 --> 21:20.289
- Someone has got to do it.
- But why me?

21:20.499 --> 21:22.879
I thought you only recruited boys
with rich fathers.

21:23.089 --> 21:25.089
Look at my father, look at us...

21:25.299 --> 21:28.429
I'm looking at you, that's why I'm
here. You can have a better life.

21:28.639 --> 21:32.059
- You want to survive selling books?
- Yes, please.

21:33.269 --> 21:35.640
I'm doing you people a favor.

21:36.100 --> 21:38.600
What about you?
You're a great pianist.

21:38.850 --> 21:41.270
We've got a police jazz band.
They'd welcome you with open arms.

21:41.480 --> 21:44.650
- Join us. You've got no work.
- Thank you, I've got work.

22:33.912 --> 22:35.872
I'm sorry, he wants you to stop.

22:38.332 --> 22:40.832
Who wants me to stop?

23:32.094 --> 23:33.935
I always say,
look on the bright side.

23:34.265 --> 23:37.565
You're in a small ghetto with
intellectuals, professional people.

23:37.765 --> 23:41.315
You're better off than us. Here in
the large ghetto it's a cesspool.

23:41.525 --> 23:44.655
- You have to give me something.
- You're an artist...

23:44.855 --> 23:46.905
you keep peoples' spirits up.
You do enough.

23:47.155 --> 23:50.655
- I want to help, do something.
- You're too well known.

23:50.865 --> 23:55.785
And you know what? You musicians
don't make good conspirators.

23:55.995 --> 24:00.126
You're too... too musical.

24:05.966 --> 24:07.096
- Who is that?
- Symche.

24:07.296 --> 24:09.466
Majorek.

24:10.516 --> 24:13.686
There are notices going up. City is
to be cleansed of the undesirables.

24:13.886 --> 24:16.896
- There's always notices going up.
- Hello, Symche.

24:17.976 --> 24:21.276
Dyrek. Mrs. Ysken.

24:22.987 --> 24:25.107
Jehuda, working hard?

24:25.317 --> 24:29.277
This is the greatest pianist in
Poland. Maybe the whole world.

24:29.487 --> 24:32.407
Wladyslaw Szpilman,
meet Majorek.

24:32.617 --> 24:34.457
- How do you do?
- I know your name.

24:35.577 --> 24:38.167
- I've never heard you play.
- Majorek used to be in the Army.

24:38.877 --> 24:43.377
Brilliant man. The only thing I've got
against him is he's not a socialist.

24:44.757 --> 24:48.138
You better go now, Wladek.
It's nearly curfew.

24:49.218 --> 24:52.098
You know how many copies
we print of our newspaper?

24:52.518 --> 24:54.308
Five hundred.

24:54.478 --> 24:57.808
You know how many people on
average read one copy? Twenty.

24:58.018 --> 25:02.648
That makes 10 thousand readers.
This will start the uprising.

25:02.858 --> 25:06.108
Majorek hides them in his underpants
and leaves them in toilets.

25:06.318 --> 25:09.159
- Toilets?
- As many toilets as I can find.

25:09.369 --> 25:11.909
Germans never use Jewish toilets.

25:12.119 --> 25:14.119
They're too clean for them.

25:20.379 --> 25:22.879
Please, mister, please.

25:50.950 --> 25:54.450
Hold it!
You little bastard!

25:57.081 --> 25:59.421
Take this!

25:59.581 --> 26:01.631
Stop it! Stop it!

26:02.591 --> 26:03.631
Stop it!

26:06.421 --> 26:09.591
Come on, come on.
Come on, boy.

26:15.641 --> 26:19.601
Stand up! Stand up.

26:49.473 --> 26:54.223
Please, tonight for once, I don't
want anything bad talked about.

26:54.433 --> 26:57.973
- Enjoy your meal.
- Then I'll tell you something funny.

26:58.183 --> 27:01.193
- You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja?
- The surgeon.

27:01.393 --> 27:06.233
The Germans allowed him into
the ghetto to perform an operation.

27:06.443 --> 27:09.614
On a Jew? They let a Pole
to come in to operate on a Jew?

27:09.824 --> 27:13.244
He got a pass, that's all I know.
Anyway, so...

27:13.454 --> 27:15.834
he puts the patient to sleep
and starts the operation.

27:15.994 --> 27:18.334
He'd just made the first incision
when the SS burst in...

27:18.954 --> 27:23.124
shoot the patient, then Dr. Raszeja
and everybody else who was there.

27:25.464 --> 27:27.924
Isn't that a laugh?

27:28.844 --> 27:32.055
The patient didn't feel a thing,
he was anesthetized.

27:32.225 --> 27:34.055
I said nothing bad.

27:34.725 --> 27:38.475
What's the matter with you all?
You lost your sense of humor?

27:39.605 --> 27:41.355
It's not funny.

27:41.565 --> 27:44.985
You know what's funny? You're
funny, with that ridiculous tie.

27:46.365 --> 27:49.365
What are you talking about? What's
my tie have to do with anything?

27:49.695 --> 27:51.825
- I need this tie for my work.
- Your work?

27:52.035 --> 27:56.326
- That's right, I work.
- Playing the piano for the parasites.

27:56.536 --> 27:59.706
- Parasites...
- Boys. Boys!

27:59.876 --> 28:02.466
- They don't give a damn.
- And you blame me for their apathy?

28:02.666 --> 28:06.176
I see it everyday. They don't even
notice what's going around them.

28:06.386 --> 28:08.346
- I blame the Americans.
- For what? For my tie?

28:08.926 --> 28:11.726
The American Jews,
and there are lots of them.

28:12.726 --> 28:16.016
What do they think they're doing?
People here are dying.

28:16.226 --> 28:18.516
Haven't got a bite to eat.

28:19.146 --> 28:24.027
The Jewish bankers should persuade
America to declare war on Germany.

28:40.917 --> 28:43.127
The lights! The lights!

29:01.018 --> 29:05.278
Turn on the lights.

29:07.949 --> 29:10.659
Come on!

29:13.539 --> 29:17.919
Open the door!
We want to go in!

29:19.789 --> 29:21.749
Open the door!

29:35.560 --> 29:37.640
Stand up!

29:39.810 --> 29:43.400
You, stand up! Come on!

29:44.030 --> 29:46.610
Throw him out!

29:59.791 --> 30:01.961
Mama...

30:14.351 --> 30:17.771
Come on, run!

31:24.504 --> 31:29.014
- I'm Mr. Szpilman's sister.
- Go in. Not you.

31:48.865 --> 31:50.945
- What?
- Come. It's terrible.

31:51.155 --> 31:54.286
- What?
- They're hunting people in the streets.

31:54.536 --> 31:56.746
They've taken Henryk.

31:58.336 --> 32:01.376
Go home, alright? Go home,
I'll take care of it.

32:13.056 --> 32:16.726
Excuse me. Have you seen
my husband? Izaak Szerman?

32:16.936 --> 32:20.817
- I'm afraid not.
- Tall, handsome, little gray beard.

32:21.027 --> 32:24.737
If you see him, write to me.
Don't forget. Izaak Szerman.

32:34.707 --> 32:36.497
What happened here?

32:36.707 --> 32:40.457
They've got my grandson. They
pick them up and take them away.

32:40.667 --> 32:44.378
What they do to them,
I've stopped believing in God.

32:45.258 --> 32:48.088
Excuse me. Excuse me.

32:49.178 --> 32:51.008
Itzak?

32:51.598 --> 32:53.138
Itzak?

32:53.348 --> 32:56.848
Itzak, it's Wladek Szpilman.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.649
- Henryk is in there.
- I haven't seen him.

33:05.859 --> 33:08.029
Believe me.
They picked him up.

33:12.329 --> 33:16.369
- Can you help?
- Now you need me. Now you need me!

33:16.539 --> 33:18.789
Can you help us?

33:19.459 --> 33:22.169
- It costs.
- I have no money.

33:22.379 --> 33:24.969
Then there's nothing I can do.
You should have joined us.

33:25.169 --> 33:29.590
- They told me you had influence.
- Who told you?

33:29.760 --> 33:33.350
People I know. They said
you're an important man.

33:36.520 --> 33:38.480
Itzak...

33:54.371 --> 33:57.331
- Hands up.
- How are you?

33:57.541 --> 34:01.251
- How are you?
- You, bandit.

34:01.461 --> 34:03.631
Dead! Dead!

34:03.841 --> 34:07.051
- He's crazy.
- Hands up.

34:07.261 --> 34:10.391
- Want a cigarette?
- Cigarette?

34:10.891 --> 34:13.891
Thank you.

34:14.601 --> 34:18.562
Everything is alright!

34:18.772 --> 34:20.902
He looks very happy.

34:21.101 --> 34:23.982
Everything is alright.

34:24.192 --> 34:27.612
Everything is alright.

34:28.152 --> 34:31.742
Hands up! Hands up!

34:32.242 --> 34:33.621
It's alright.

34:35.411 --> 34:37.621
Help! Help!

34:37.831 --> 34:41.463
Let go! Help!

35:34.765 --> 35:38.225
- Why did they pick you up?
- So you go to Itzak Heller?

35:38.435 --> 35:41.985
- Did I ask you to talk to him?
- You're out, aren't you?

35:42.145 --> 35:47.115
- Did you beg to that piece of shit?
- I asked him to help you.

35:47.735 --> 35:49.995
What did you pay him?

35:50.945 --> 35:55.456
With what could I pay him? Every
zloty I earn we spend on food.

35:55.666 --> 35:58.706
- I can look after myself.
- They were taking you away.

35:58.916 --> 36:02.836
It's got nothing to do with you.
It's me they wanted, not you.

36:03.046 --> 36:06.386
Why do you have to interfere
with other people's business?

36:06.546 --> 36:10.716
- You're mad. That's your trouble.
- That's also my business.

36:19.937 --> 36:23.277
What's the matter?
Are you sick?

36:24.317 --> 36:26.737
Hungry.

36:33.957 --> 36:38.287
Employment certificate. What's that
mean, no employment certificate?

36:38.497 --> 36:41.338
You have to have an
employment certificate...

36:41.548 --> 36:44.128
to work for the Germans
in the ghetto, otherwise...

36:44.338 --> 36:47.178
- Otherwise what?
- You'll be deported.

36:47.388 --> 36:50.718
- So the rumors were true.
- They're going to resettle us...

36:51.638 --> 36:54.768
and send us to labor camps,
in the East.

36:56.688 --> 36:59.688
- They're closing the small ghetto.
- Oh, God!

37:14.999 --> 37:16.919
Wladek? Wladek?

37:17.999 --> 37:21.879
I thought you were on tour playing
in London, Paris, New York, Chicago.

37:22.089 --> 37:24.879
- Not this week.
- You look terrible.

37:25.219 --> 37:28.050
Have you heard the rumors? They're
going to resettle us in the East.

37:28.260 --> 37:32.390
Rumors! You take it all too much
to heart. What's the trouble?

37:32.600 --> 37:37.020
I've been trying to get the certificate
of employment for my father.

37:37.190 --> 37:40.610
I managed to get one for me and my
family, but I need one for my father.

37:40.810 --> 37:44.030
- I've been to all the firms and shops...
- Why didn't you come to me?

37:44.280 --> 37:46.400
I didn't know you were
in the certificate business.

37:46.610 --> 37:49.070
I'm not, but Majorek is.

37:51.160 --> 37:53.371
Can you help?
I have no money.

37:53.541 --> 37:56.961
Please, don't insult us.
Can you do something for him?

37:57.161 --> 37:59.581
Be at the Schultz workshop
tomorrow, four o'clock.

37:59.871 --> 38:02.541
See what a wonderful piece
of luck you've had today?

38:02.751 --> 38:06.631
That's the historical imperative in
action! That's why I always say:

38:06.841 --> 38:09.221
- "Look on the bright side!"
- Yes, I know.

38:22.362 --> 38:24.942
- How's your back?
- Better.

38:25.152 --> 38:27.152
Better?

38:27.322 --> 38:29.322
Better not ask.

38:42.383 --> 38:47.513
- Thank you.
- My pleasure. Won't help you anyway.

38:49.973 --> 38:52.303
Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

40:03.216 --> 40:06.336
At least we got work
in the ghetto.

40:07.216 --> 40:09.716
At least we are still together.

40:23.737 --> 40:26.407
Everybody out!
To the courtyard!

40:26.607 --> 40:28.987
Move, move!

40:29.577 --> 40:33.957
We are workers. We have
employment certification.

40:37.747 --> 40:39.878
Wait.

40:40.628 --> 40:41.628
Here.

40:41.918 --> 40:45.048
Go over there. Hurry.

40:45.258 --> 40:47.258
You.

40:47.638 --> 40:50.348
You. You.

40:52.138 --> 40:53.928
You.

40:55.638 --> 40:57.558
You.

40:58.978 --> 41:01.148
You.

41:09.989 --> 41:13.409
The others, put your clothes on
and come back here.

41:13.619 --> 41:16.829
Bring your things with you.
15 kilos only.

41:17.039 --> 41:19.959
Where are you taking us?

41:43.690 --> 41:46.240
I'm sorry, I did my best.

41:48.610 --> 41:51.621
- I thought the certificates'd save us.
- Stop it, Wladek.

41:51.781 --> 41:55.411
Let's just hope that Henryk
and Halina will be better off.

42:22.942 --> 42:25.282
- Where will we be going?
- You're going to work.

42:25.442 --> 42:28.862
You'll be much better off than
in the stinking ghetto. Move.

42:33.492 --> 42:37.453
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

42:38.163 --> 42:43.543
Why did I do it?
Why did I do it?

42:44.843 --> 42:48.383
Why did I do it?

43:31.595 --> 43:34.305
Don't you have a bottle of water?
He's dying.

43:34.515 --> 43:36.435
My child is dying of thirst.

43:36.605 --> 43:38.525
- I beg you.
- I'm sorry.

43:38.685 --> 43:42.605
- Don't you have water? I beg you.
- Can you hear what I'm saying?

43:42.775 --> 43:45.115
- I'm telling you, it's a disgrace.
- I can hear you.

43:45.315 --> 43:47.655
Letting them take us to our death
like sheep to the slaughter.

43:47.825 --> 43:49.996
- Not so loud.
- Why don't we attack them?

43:50.196 --> 43:53.366
There's half a million of us here.
We can break out of the ghetto.

43:53.576 --> 43:56.286
At least we can die honorably, not
as a stain on the face of History.

43:56.496 --> 43:59.206
Why are you so sure they're
sending us to our death?

43:59.416 --> 44:02.006
You know why I'm not sure?
Because they didn't tell me.

44:02.546 --> 44:06.256
- They're going to wipe us all out.
- What do you want me to do? Fight?

44:06.466 --> 44:09.096
To fight, we need organization,
plans, guns.

44:09.256 --> 44:11.926
He's right. Do you think I'm going
to fight with my violin bowl?

44:12.136 --> 44:14.977
The Germans would never squander
a huge labor force like this.

44:15.517 --> 44:17.607
They're sending us to a labor camp,
it's obvious.

44:17.807 --> 44:19.187
Sure.

44:19.357 --> 44:23.777
Look at that cripple, the old people,
the children. They're going to work?

44:24.027 --> 44:27.777
Look at you. You're going to carry
logs on your back?

45:09.739 --> 45:13.079
Henryk! Halina, Henryk!

45:22.999 --> 45:27.430
I missed you.
I wanted to be with you!

45:36.230 --> 45:38.770
I wanted to be with you!

45:38.940 --> 45:41.060
Stupid. Stupid.

45:41.440 --> 45:45.690
Why did I do it? Why did I do it?

45:45.860 --> 45:49.161
She's getting on my nerves.

45:53.161 --> 45:58.121
- What did she do, for God's sake?
- She smothered her baby.

46:00.131 --> 46:03.671
They prepared a hiding place
and of course they went there.

46:03.881 --> 46:06.761
The baby cried
just as the police came.

46:06.971 --> 46:11.141
She smothered the cries with
her hands, the baby died.

46:12.392 --> 46:16.182
A policeman heard the death rattle
and found where they were hiding.

46:41.333 --> 46:43.633
What are you reading?

46:46.053 --> 46:50.933
"If you prick us, de we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?

46:51.093 --> 46:53.353
If you poison us, do we not die?

46:53.553 --> 46:56.683
And, if you wrong us,
shall we not revenge?"

47:04.314 --> 47:07.824
- Very appropriate.
- Yes. That's why I brought it.

47:25.675 --> 47:29.305
Idiot. What does he think
he's gonna do with the money?

47:30.385 --> 47:33.135
Boy, come here.

47:33.895 --> 47:35.685
Come here.

47:37.015 --> 47:39.025
- How much for a caramel?
- 20 zlotys.

47:39.815 --> 47:42.695
For one caramel? What do you think
you're gonna do with the money?

47:42.895 --> 47:45.195
20 zlotys.

47:46.735 --> 47:48.946
We've got 20 between us.

47:49.116 --> 47:51.706
I've got 10, I think.

47:54.456 --> 47:57.246
5, 10, 20.

49:19.959 --> 49:22.800
- Halina?
- What?

49:24.170 --> 49:28.130
- It's a funny time to say this, but...
- What?

49:29.180 --> 49:32.680
I wish I knew you better.

49:35.390 --> 49:37.440
Thank you.

49:53.831 --> 49:55.541
Szpilman?

50:05.211 --> 50:07.671
Papa? Papa?

50:10.051 --> 50:12.472
Mama? Halina?

50:13.052 --> 50:15.642
Halina? Mama?

50:16.272 --> 50:21.272
What do you think you're doing?
I've saved your life. Just go! Go!

50:24.902 --> 50:27.192
Don't run!

50:28.782 --> 50:30.862
Anna!

50:31.032 --> 50:33.412
Anna!

50:53.093 --> 50:56.263
Off they go to the melting pot.

50:59.314 --> 51:04.064
- This stays.
- Give it to me!

51:09.154 --> 51:11.914
What are you doing?
She's pregnant.

53:38.940 --> 53:40.900
Wladek?

53:59.081 --> 54:02.171
Why are you here, Wladek?

54:02.381 --> 54:05.091
It's like this, I...

54:06.761 --> 54:08.682
We...

54:10.972 --> 54:13.892
All of them, all of them.

54:14.062 --> 54:16.312
All of them.

54:17.432 --> 54:21.402
Perhaps they're lucky.
The quicker, the better.

54:21.602 --> 54:24.772
It's not finished yet. We'll stay
here for a couple of days...

54:24.982 --> 54:26.992
until things die down.

54:27.192 --> 54:30.702
I've bribed the policeman,
he'll come when it's over.

54:32.913 --> 54:36.663
Attention!
On the march!

54:46.673 --> 54:48.633
Onward!

54:51.013 --> 54:54.143
My God, I haven't been outside in,
it must be two years.

54:54.353 --> 54:57.354
Don't get overexcited.

55:13.324 --> 55:16.534
It's gold.
Very good price.

55:37.605 --> 55:39.565
Someone you know?

55:39.725 --> 55:41.735
A beauty.
Who is she?

55:41.945 --> 55:46.026
She's a singer. I knew her well.
Her husband is an actor.

55:46.236 --> 55:48.696
They're good people.
I'd like to talk to her.

55:48.866 --> 55:52.746
Don't forget, Wladek.
They hang them for helping Jews.

56:19.567 --> 56:21.987
Turn left!

56:22.147 --> 56:24.647
On the march!

56:28.827 --> 56:31.618
Stop! Halt!
Attention!

56:38.958 --> 56:41.878
At ease.

56:45.968 --> 56:48.758
Turn right!

56:55.939 --> 56:58.649
Step forward.

56:59.189 --> 57:00.769
You.

57:03.029 --> 57:05.609
You. You.

57:06.319 --> 57:08.159
You.

57:12.119 --> 57:14.199
Down on the ground!

57:14.369 --> 57:17.539
Down on the ground!

57:44.821 --> 57:46.951
Turn left!

57:48.111 --> 57:50.571
On the march.

58:30.613 --> 58:32.873
How long have you been here?

58:33.073 --> 58:35.993
Since last night.

58:36.203 --> 58:38.623
I was pleased to see you.

58:42.543 --> 58:45.883
They're going to start
the final resettlement now.

58:47.713 --> 58:50.053
We know what it means.

58:51.133 --> 58:55.064
We sent someone out.
Zygmund, a good man.

58:57.564 --> 59:01.064
His orders were to follow
the trains out of Warsaw.

59:02.404 --> 59:04.614
He got to Sokolow.

59:04.814 --> 59:09.574
A man told him the tracks divided,
one branch's leading to Treblinka.

59:11.324 --> 59:15.204
He said everyday freight trains
carrying people from Warsaw...

59:15.414 --> 59:19.415
branch off to Treblinka
and return empty.

59:19.585 --> 59:22.625
No transports of food
are ever seen on that line.

59:23.465 --> 59:26.885
The civilians are forbidden
to approach the Treblinka station.

59:30.925 --> 59:33.225
They're exterminating us.

59:37.065 --> 59:39.725
It won't take them long.

59:41.105 --> 59:44.696
We are 60 thousand left,
out of half a million.

59:45.486 --> 59:48.076
Mostly young people.

59:49.326 --> 59:52.406
And this time we're gonna fight.

59:54.166 --> 59:56.956
We're in good shape.

59:57.166 --> 01:00:01.126
Organized.
We're prepared.

01:00:01.296 --> 01:00:04.176
If you need help, I...

01:00:23.647 --> 01:00:26.987
You! Come here!

01:00:28.027 --> 01:00:29.828
Shit!

01:00:37.878 --> 01:00:40.248
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:00:41.378 --> 01:00:43.918
I don't know what I was thinking.

01:00:53.178 --> 01:00:57.599
Take this! Take this!

01:01:12.239 --> 01:01:15.079
Take him away.

01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:34.390
I hope you play the piano better
than you carry bricks.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.650
He won't last long
if he goes on like this.

01:01:38.810 --> 01:01:41.771
I'll see if I can get him
something better.

01:02:04.461 --> 01:02:06.212
Trouble.

01:02:06.462 --> 01:02:08.932
Round up only the Jews!

01:02:09.182 --> 01:02:12.102
Round up!
Only the Jews.

01:02:12.352 --> 01:02:15.772
The Polish keep working.
Only the Jews.

01:02:23.062 --> 01:02:26.032
I have good news for you.

01:02:26.232 --> 01:02:31.163
There are rumors going around
that we like to...

01:02:31.363 --> 01:02:34.283
to resettle you.

01:02:36.203 --> 01:02:41.253
I promise you that now
and in the future...

01:02:41.463 --> 01:02:45.053
nothing else is planned.

01:02:46.053 --> 01:02:52.393
For this reason, we put
information posters on the wall.

01:02:53.724 --> 01:02:57.064
To show you our goodwill...

01:02:57.224 --> 01:03:01.194
you should vote one of you
to be allowed...

01:03:01.394 --> 01:03:04.444
to go in town daily...

01:03:04.864 --> 01:03:11.034
and bring 3 kilos of potatoes...

01:03:11.244 --> 01:03:15.744
and one loaf of bread
for each of your workers.

01:03:15.914 --> 01:03:21.375
So, why should we do something
like this if we'd resettle you?

01:03:22.585 --> 01:03:27.965
You can make good business
out of the things you don't eat.

01:03:29.465 --> 01:03:35.145
Isn't that something that you Jews
are good in? Making money?

01:03:39.105 --> 01:03:40.276
Dismiss them.

01:03:56.626 --> 01:04:00.586
That one, with the string.
The others, tied by wire.

01:05:09.319 --> 01:05:10.489
Now!

01:05:48.031 --> 01:05:50.031
Majorek.

01:05:51.741 --> 01:05:54.701
I have a favor to ask.

01:05:55.331 --> 01:05:57.711
I want to get out of here.

01:06:00.421 --> 01:06:04.922
It's easy to get out. It's how you'll
survive on the other side that's hard.

01:06:05.132 --> 01:06:07.422
I know.

01:06:08.222 --> 01:06:12.102
Last summer, I worked for a day
in the Zelazna Brama Square.

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:15.812
I saw someone I knew,
she's an old friend.

01:06:15.932 --> 01:06:19.482
A singer, her husband
is an actor.

01:06:20.982 --> 01:06:25.112
I've filled their names down and
their address, if they're still there.

01:06:25.282 --> 01:06:30.243
Janina Godlewska and Andrzej
Bogucki. They're good people.

01:06:31.243 --> 01:06:34.203
Would you try to make contact?

01:06:35.293 --> 01:06:41.043
You go to town everyday. Ask them
if they'd help me get out of here.

01:07:13.994 --> 01:07:16.705
Have you got any plaster?

01:07:26.045 --> 01:07:29.345
What are you up to?

01:07:30.925 --> 01:07:33.475
What have you got there?

01:07:33.685 --> 01:07:37.645
We are allowed to take
food to the ghetto.

01:07:37.855 --> 01:07:40.686
Three kilos of potato and bread.

01:07:40.856 --> 01:07:42.986
Open it.

01:07:46.736 --> 01:07:51.746
- It's only potatoes and bread.
- You're lying. That's not true.

01:07:53.156 --> 01:07:55.326
Open it.

01:08:23.277 --> 01:08:25.487
Potatoes!

01:08:29.118 --> 01:08:32.158
You Jews are all alike.

01:08:32.368 --> 01:08:36.078
We reach you with a finger...

01:08:36.247 --> 01:08:39.287
and you take the whole hand.

01:08:52.599 --> 01:08:56.979
If you lie to me again,
I'll kill you. Personally.

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:23.250
I've tried your friends.

01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:26.840
- They don't live there anymore.
- Did you make contact?

01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:29.510
- Be ready to leave.
- When?

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:31.640
- Soon.
- Halt!

01:09:33.310 --> 01:09:35.229
Shit! Shit!

01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:38.100
Wait. What's going on here?

01:09:38.310 --> 01:09:41.981
Take this! Take this!

01:09:48.241 --> 01:09:52.281
I'll teach you some discipline,
you dirty Jews.

01:09:56.621 --> 01:09:59.001
Do you know why
you're being hit?

01:09:59.171 --> 01:10:02.342
- No.
- Do you know why you're being hit?

01:10:02.542 --> 01:10:07.092
- Why?
- To celebrate New Year.

01:10:09.382 --> 01:10:11.642
On the march!

01:10:11.972 --> 01:10:14.472
March and sing!

01:10:14.892 --> 01:10:16.642
Sing something nice!

01:10:17.392 --> 01:10:20.352
Loud and clear!

01:10:21.192 --> 01:10:25.192
Reunite tonight
And follow the white eagle

01:10:25.403 --> 01:10:29.533
Stand up and fight
Our mortal enemies

01:10:29.703 --> 01:10:33.583
Rise on the day
Let's give them fire and brimstone

01:10:33.743 --> 01:10:37.753
We'll do away
The Yoke of slavery

01:10:37.913 --> 01:10:41.713
Punish and rout
The rapists of our nation

01:10:41.883 --> 01:10:46.053
We'll slash them out
To save our dignity

01:11:19.705 --> 01:11:21.755
Come.

01:12:36.288 --> 01:12:37.998
I'm sorry.

01:12:38.208 --> 01:12:40.958
I'm dirty. I'm so filthy.

01:13:05.989 --> 01:13:08.949
We haven't much time.
Come on.

01:13:16.660 --> 01:13:18.540
We must hurry.

01:13:18.670 --> 01:13:21.040
Here. See if this fit.

01:13:21.250 --> 01:13:25.380
We have to keep moving you. Germans
are hunting down indiscriminately.

01:13:25.590 --> 01:13:28.840
Jews, non-Jews, anybody, everybody.

01:13:29.010 --> 01:13:32.970
You better shave.
Use my razor on the shelf.

01:13:47.861 --> 01:13:50.821
You'll be looked after
by Gebczynski.

01:13:51.031 --> 01:13:53.081
He's on the other side of town.

01:13:53.201 --> 01:13:57.081
You stay there tonight,
then we'll find you somewhere else.

01:13:57.541 --> 01:14:02.002
- I'll bring you food.
- Alright, let's go.

01:14:41.333 --> 01:14:44.253
I'll show you where
you're going to sleep.

01:15:14.625 --> 01:15:17.585
You have to stay here
until tomorrow afternoon.

01:15:17.795 --> 01:15:22.715
We have a flat for you near
the ghetto wall. But it's safe.

01:15:30.015 --> 01:15:32.515
It's not going to be very comfortable.

01:15:33.055 --> 01:15:35.056
I'll be fine.

01:15:44.986 --> 01:15:47.156
Thank you.

01:16:02.587 --> 01:16:05.257
Here. Here. Give it to me.

01:16:05.927 --> 01:16:09.887
Go as near to the front as possible,
to the German section.

01:16:28.238 --> 01:16:30.028
DO NOT PASS

01:17:01.359 --> 01:17:03.899
I'm going to draw the curtains now.

01:17:09.409 --> 01:17:13.160
But you leave them open
during the day. Don't forget.

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:19.500
Must feel better on
this side of the wall, eh?

01:17:19.710 --> 01:17:21.250
Yes.

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:27.090
But sometimes I'm still not sure
which side of the wall I'm on.

01:17:28.930 --> 01:17:32.600
Some bread, potatoes, onions.

01:17:32.810 --> 01:17:36.231
I'll come again.
Janina will visit you twice a week.

01:17:36.391 --> 01:17:38.901
To bring more food,
see how you are.

01:17:39.231 --> 01:17:41.401
Thank you.

01:17:43.691 --> 01:17:46.951
This is very important.
In case of emergency...

01:17:47.151 --> 01:17:51.451
I mean emergency,
go to this address.

01:18:33.993 --> 01:18:36.203
What do you mean you forgot?

01:18:36.373 --> 01:18:39.373
What do you think I mean?
I forgot, that's what I mean.

01:18:39.503 --> 01:18:45.093
- You know, you treat me like dirt.
- Because you are a dirt.

01:18:45.303 --> 01:18:47.764
- Pig! Pig!
- Bitch!

01:18:47.964 --> 01:18:50.764
- Dirty pig!
- You are a dirty pig!

01:18:50.974 --> 01:18:53.684
Takes one to know one. Pig.

01:18:57.774 --> 01:19:02.604
- You play like an angel.
- Then why don't you listen?

01:19:02.774 --> 01:19:05.024
- I'm listening.
- Liar.

01:19:05.194 --> 01:19:08.534
You fell asleep. Pig.

01:19:29.885 --> 01:19:33.936
Spread out!
We're being attacked!

01:19:36.436 --> 01:19:38.856
Take cover!

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:41.526
Shoot!

01:19:53.616 --> 01:19:56.496
Take cover! Fire!

01:20:00.667 --> 01:20:03.467
Come on, get out!

01:21:31.010 --> 01:21:33.311
The attack was successful.

01:21:35.311 --> 01:21:37.561
That building...

01:21:45.321 --> 01:21:47.401
Turn that way!

01:21:54.121 --> 01:21:56.041
Shoot!

01:22:20.273 --> 01:22:22.273
Thank you.

01:22:25.403 --> 01:22:28.653
- I wanted to come earlier, but...
- No, thank you.

01:22:32.743 --> 01:22:36.543
No-one thought
they'd hold out so long.

01:22:36.703 --> 01:22:39.253
I never should've come out. I should
have stayed and fought with them.

01:22:39.463 --> 01:22:42.923
Wladek, stop that. It's over now.

01:22:43.083 --> 01:22:46.004
Just be proud of them.

01:22:46.214 --> 01:22:49.764
- My God, did they put up a fight!
- Yes.

01:22:51.804 --> 01:22:54.644
- So did the Germans.
- They are in shock!

01:22:54.854 --> 01:23:00.604
They didn't expect it. Nobody
expected it. Jews fighting back.

01:23:00.774 --> 01:23:05.614
- Who would have thought?
- What good did it do?

01:23:05.774 --> 01:23:07.825
What good?

01:23:08.035 --> 01:23:10.455
Wladek, I'm surprised with you.

01:23:10.615 --> 01:23:15.455
They died with dignity.
And you know something else?

01:23:16.335 --> 01:23:20.545
Now the Poles will rise.
We are ready.

01:23:20.755 --> 01:23:24.135
We'll fight too.
You'll see.

01:23:38.396 --> 01:23:41.066
Get your things together.
You have to leave.

01:23:41.276 --> 01:23:43.906
What? What's happened?

01:23:46.316 --> 01:23:48.616
- I'm on the run.
- What's happened?

01:23:48.826 --> 01:23:52.956
The Gestapo found our weapons.
They've arrested Janina and Andrzej.

01:23:53.826 --> 01:23:57.707
They're bound to find out about this
place too. You must get away at once.

01:23:57.917 --> 01:24:00.337
Where do you want me to go?

01:24:00.507 --> 01:24:04.047
Look at me, I'm not leaving.

01:24:05.087 --> 01:24:08.507
- Can I take my chances here?
- That's your decision.

01:24:08.677 --> 01:24:11.467
But when they storm the flat,
throw yourself out the window...

01:24:11.677 --> 01:24:13.517
don't let them get you alive.

01:24:13.687 --> 01:24:16.937
I have poison on me.
They won't get me alive either.

01:27:33.056 --> 01:27:35.356
Open up!

01:27:38.016 --> 01:27:42.356
Open the door
or we'll call the police!

01:28:10.267 --> 01:28:14.347
Are you from this flat?
You're not registered.

01:28:14.557 --> 01:28:17.808
It belongs to a friend of mine. I just
came to visit, but I missed him.

01:28:17.978 --> 01:28:20.438
Have you got your identity card?

01:28:21.068 --> 01:28:24.028
- Let me see your identity card.
- Yes, of course.

01:28:26.698 --> 01:28:29.198
- I want to see your identity card!
- What's happening?

01:28:29.408 --> 01:28:32.078
He's a Jew! A Jew!

01:28:32.288 --> 01:28:34.158
Stop the Jew!

01:28:35.168 --> 01:28:37.878
Don't let him out!
Stop him!

01:29:51.201 --> 01:29:55.452
- Yes?
- Mr. Gebczynski sent me.

01:30:01.582 --> 01:30:05.632
- Wladyslaw Szpilman.
- Dorota.

01:30:06.922 --> 01:30:08.932
Come in.

01:30:15.932 --> 01:30:17.523
I'm sorry.

01:30:17.733 --> 01:30:21.233
I was given this address and
I'm looking for a Mr. Dzikiewicz.

01:30:21.443 --> 01:30:25.113
Michal Dzikiewicz, he's my husband.

01:30:25.283 --> 01:30:27.033
Come in.

01:30:34.993 --> 01:30:37.003
Sit.

01:30:39.963 --> 01:30:42.334
I need help.

01:30:44.134 --> 01:30:47.054
He'll be back before curfew.

01:30:47.214 --> 01:30:49.844
I've been in hiding.

01:30:51.014 --> 01:30:54.554
- I need somewhere to stay.
- He'll be here soon.

01:30:56.724 --> 01:30:59.894
- How long have you been married?
- Just over a year.

01:31:02.694 --> 01:31:05.325
And how is Jurek?

01:31:05.525 --> 01:31:07.235
Dead.

01:31:13.915 --> 01:31:17.745
- When is your baby due?
- Christmas.

01:31:18.415 --> 01:31:22.215
This is not a good time to
have children, but then...

01:31:24.465 --> 01:31:27.925
This is my husband.
Wladyslaw Szpilman.

01:31:28.095 --> 01:31:32.936
- Marek Gebczynski sent him.
- Yes, I remember.

01:31:34.806 --> 01:31:37.516
He said to contact you
only in case of emergency.

01:31:37.726 --> 01:31:39.606
Don't worry now.

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:52.787
We can't move you tonight.
You'll sleep on the sofa.

01:31:57.457 --> 01:31:59.297
Excuse me.

01:32:03.257 --> 01:32:06.297
I'm sorry,
could I have a piece of bread?

01:32:06.507 --> 01:32:09.257
Yes, of course.
We will eat.

01:32:09.927 --> 01:32:13.557
Sit. Please, sit.

01:32:13.767 --> 01:32:15.557
Thank you.

01:34:23.733 --> 01:34:26.783
You're on a very German area.

01:34:26.993 --> 01:34:31.413
On the opposite is a hospital taking
wounded from the Russian front.

01:34:33.283 --> 01:34:36.623
And next door is the
Schutzpolizei.

01:34:38.043 --> 01:34:40.374
Safest place to be.

01:34:40.584 --> 01:34:43.504
Right at the heart
of the lion's den.

01:34:48.594 --> 01:34:50.804
I'll be locking you in.

01:34:50.974 --> 01:34:55.014
No-one knows you're here,
so keep as quiet as possible.

01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:06.570
All well?

01:37:07.110 --> 01:37:09.410
Thank you.

01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:17.460
This is Antek Szalas.
He'll be looking after you.

01:37:17.620 --> 01:37:19.460
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

01:37:19.630 --> 01:37:21.460
Thank you.

01:37:21.710 --> 01:37:26.671
I've given him a second key. He'll
bring food, see that you're alright.

01:37:27.181 --> 01:37:29.801
He's with the underground,
he's a good man.

01:37:33.891 --> 01:37:38.101
- You don't remember me?
- I don't think so.

01:37:38.311 --> 01:37:41.821
Warsaw Radio.
I was a technician.

01:37:42.401 --> 01:37:45.571
I saw you almost everyday.

01:37:46.151 --> 01:37:49.612
- I'm sorry, I don't remember.
- It doesn't matter.

01:37:51.872 --> 01:37:55.582
You've nothing to worry about.
I'll visit often.

01:37:56.412 --> 01:37:59.212
You'll be pleased to hear that
the Allies are bombing Germany...

01:37:59.372 --> 01:38:01.422
night after night,
after night.

01:38:01.632 --> 01:38:04.132
Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin.

01:38:04.382 --> 01:38:07.672
And the Russians are giving them
hell. It's the beginning of the end.

01:38:07.882 --> 01:38:09.472
Let's hope so.

01:38:20.353 --> 01:38:22.563
Come here.

01:38:22.733 --> 01:38:24.943
Be careful with it.

01:38:25.863 --> 01:38:28.823
That's it. Be careful.

01:38:55.564 --> 01:38:58.434
Still alive then?

01:39:01.775 --> 01:39:05.945
Here. Sausage, bread.

01:39:06.155 --> 01:39:08.365
You still got that vodka?

01:39:22.715 --> 01:39:26.676
- How long is this meant to last?
- Not long now.

01:39:27.216 --> 01:39:30.386
I think I've got jaundice.

01:39:30.596 --> 01:39:34.436
Don't worry about that.
It just makes you look funny.

01:39:35.516 --> 01:39:39.566
My grandfather was jilted by
his girlfriend when he got jaundice.

01:39:39.776 --> 01:39:41.686
Drink up.

01:39:42.526 --> 01:39:45.566
Why didn't you come sooner?
It's been over two weeks...

01:39:45.776 --> 01:39:47.576
Problems.

01:39:47.776 --> 01:39:49.867
Money.

01:39:50.287 --> 01:39:52.907
I've got to raise money
to buy the food.

01:39:53.117 --> 01:39:56.997
I need things to sell,
it's not easy.

01:40:00.877 --> 01:40:03.547
Here. Sell this.

01:40:05.887 --> 01:40:08.097
Food is more important than time.

01:40:13.308 --> 01:40:16.438
Oh, yes. I meant to tell you!
The Allies have landed in France.

01:40:16.648 --> 01:40:18.938
Russians will be here soon.

01:40:19.398 --> 01:40:22.398
They'll beat the shit
out of the Germans...

01:40:23.238 --> 01:40:25.278
any day now.

01:41:09.200 --> 01:41:11.240
Wladek?

01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:23.590
I knew it.
I knew this would happen.

01:41:25.841 --> 01:41:28.181
- I'll get a doctor.
- You can't. It's too dangerous.

01:41:28.381 --> 01:41:32.061
- Dr. Luczak. We can trust him.
- Ridiculous. He's a pediatrician.

01:41:32.221 --> 01:41:34.681
- He's still a doctor.
- No.

01:41:34.891 --> 01:41:38.101
You stay. I'll go.

01:42:11.222 --> 01:42:14.063
We came to say goodbye.

01:42:14.263 --> 01:42:17.273
We're going to stay
with my mother in Otwocks.

01:42:17.483 --> 01:42:20.813
The baby is already there.
It's safer.

01:42:20.983 --> 01:42:25.113
There's talk that the uprising
will begin any day now.

01:42:26.403 --> 01:42:29.403
That man Szalas should be shot.

01:42:29.953 --> 01:42:34.123
He's been collecting money
on your behalf all over Warsaw.

01:42:34.913 --> 01:42:39.964
Apparently people gave generously,
so he collected a tidy sum.

01:42:44.294 --> 01:42:47.134
My God.

01:42:50.304 --> 01:42:55.644
The liver the size of a football.
Inflammation of the gall bladder...

01:42:56.314 --> 01:42:58.774
but he'll leave.

01:43:00.815 --> 01:43:05.065
I'll try to get him some laevulose,
but it's not easy.

01:43:05.275 --> 01:43:08.945
- Can you visit him again?
- Who knows.

01:43:09.155 --> 01:43:13.285
- Doctor, thank you.
- Don't speak, rest.

01:43:16.835 --> 01:43:19.415
Thank you so much for coming.

01:43:21.045 --> 01:43:23.296
We've brought you some food.

01:43:23.506 --> 01:43:27.346
I'll prepare something now
for you, then we must go.

01:44:08.927 --> 01:44:11.268
I'll throw a grenade!

01:44:19.518 --> 01:44:22.068
There's a wounded man over there!

01:44:22.568 --> 01:44:25.108
Come.

01:44:25.238 --> 01:44:27.658
Watch out! Watch out!

01:44:28.778 --> 01:44:31.738
- I'll go get help!
- Hurry!

01:44:32.408 --> 01:44:36.419
Come on! Bring the litter!

01:44:40.249 --> 01:44:42.879
Go back inside!

01:46:31.953 --> 01:46:34.624
Get out, get out in the streets!

01:46:34.834 --> 01:46:38.624
Get out now! The Germans
have surrounded the building!

01:47:19.705 --> 01:47:24.006
Somebody...
Somebody help me!

01:48:21.898 --> 01:48:25.068
Are you alright?
There's too much dust.

01:48:25.448 --> 01:48:30.028
I'll check this side.
Don't worry.

01:48:30.238 --> 01:48:32.699
Be careful!

01:48:38.129 --> 01:48:40.799
- Heinrich?
- I'm checking!

01:48:43.339 --> 01:48:45.879
Is there anybody here?

01:48:49.969 --> 01:48:54.099
- Come on down!
- Alright, I'm coming.

01:53:02.320 --> 01:53:04.150
Come on, pile them up.

01:53:10.490 --> 01:53:12.700
Throw it.

01:54:36.954 --> 01:54:39.914
We have to mark everything.

01:54:40.964 --> 01:54:41.924
Come on.

02:01:43.152 --> 02:01:45.532
What are you doing here?

02:01:49.992 --> 02:01:52.332
Who are you?

02:01:56.452 --> 02:02:00.042
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

02:02:02.132 --> 02:02:04.423
What are you doing?

02:02:10.183 --> 02:02:12.183
I was...

02:02:12.303 --> 02:02:15.393
trying to open this can.

02:02:16.063 --> 02:02:18.733
Do you live here?

02:02:21.153 --> 02:02:23.113
Do you work here?

02:02:23.313 --> 02:02:25.023
No.

02:02:28.704 --> 02:02:31.204
What do you do for a living?

02:02:34.244 --> 02:02:36.044
I am...

02:02:37.664 --> 02:02:40.674
I was a pianist.

02:02:42.754 --> 02:02:45.004
Pianist?

02:03:03.775 --> 02:03:05.775
Come.

02:03:30.726 --> 02:03:32.976
Play something.

02:08:52.180 --> 02:08:54.980
Are you hiding here?

02:08:59.730 --> 02:09:01.400
Jew?

02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:06.820
Where are you hiding yourself?

02:09:08.450 --> 02:09:10.450
In the attic.

02:09:13.701 --> 02:09:16.041
Show it to me.

02:09:39.522 --> 02:09:41.812
Have you got anything to eat?

02:10:28.154 --> 02:10:33.744
According to them,
it's very important that...

02:10:40.464 --> 02:10:42.254
Attention!

02:10:43.964 --> 02:10:47.015
- At ease.
- At ease.

02:11:52.247 --> 02:11:54.247
Jew?

02:12:08.678 --> 02:12:10.138
Please.

02:12:10.558 --> 02:12:12.598
What does it mean,
all that shooting?

02:12:13.138 --> 02:12:15.898
The Russians,
on the other side of the river.

02:12:17.268 --> 02:12:20.728
You just have to hold on
a couple of weeks, not more.

02:13:52.242 --> 02:13:55.042
- What's going on?
- We're leaving.

02:13:57.963 --> 02:14:01.293
- Are the Russians here?
- Not yet.

02:14:04.213 --> 02:14:08.093
I don't know how to thank you.

02:14:09.553 --> 02:14:11.763
Thank God, not me.

02:14:12.183 --> 02:14:17.813
He wants us to survive. At least,
we have to believe in that.

02:14:27.654 --> 02:14:30.994
Here. Take it.

02:14:32.034 --> 02:14:36.334
- And you?
- I have another one. Warmer.

02:14:40.754 --> 02:14:44.344
What are you going to do
when this is over?

02:14:46.175 --> 02:14:50.515
I'll play piano again at
the Polish radio station.

02:14:51.385 --> 02:14:53.185
Tell me your name.

02:14:53.395 --> 02:14:56.065
Maybe I'll listen to you playing.

02:14:56.225 --> 02:14:58.355
Szpilman.

02:15:02.565 --> 02:15:05.445
Perfect name for a pianist.

02:16:27.699 --> 02:16:30.369
German! German!

02:16:53.520 --> 02:16:56.190
Don't shoot, I'm Polish!

02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:59.230
I'm Polish!

02:17:00.020 --> 02:17:02.730
- Come out with your hands up!
- Please! I beg of you!

02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:08.110
Don't shoot, don't shoot.
I beg you, I'm a Polish.

02:17:08.321 --> 02:17:10.331
Come down!

02:17:13.870 --> 02:17:18.001
Please, I'm Polish.
Please.

02:17:18.210 --> 02:17:20.380
He's Polish.

02:17:23.251 --> 02:17:25.511
Yes, he's Polish.

02:17:26.761 --> 02:17:29.221
Why the fucking coat?

02:17:30.300 --> 02:17:32.562
I'm cold.

02:17:51.572 --> 02:17:54.582
Look at them.
German fuckers!

02:17:55.121 --> 02:17:58.163
Murderers! Murderers!

02:17:58.413 --> 02:18:01.633
- Dirty bastards!
- Assassins!

02:18:01.833 --> 02:18:05.303
- Bastards!
- Look at you now!

02:18:05.463 --> 02:18:09.433
You took everything I had.
Me, a musician.

02:18:09.633 --> 02:18:13.053
You took my violin,
you took my soul.

02:18:17.933 --> 02:18:19.602
Musician?

02:18:20.814 --> 02:18:22.773
Are you a musician?

02:18:23.734 --> 02:18:25.904
Do you know...

02:18:26.234 --> 02:18:29.404
a pianist called Szpilman,
from the Polish radio station?

02:18:29.614 --> 02:18:34.834
- Of course I know him.
- I helped him to hide himself.

02:18:35.624 --> 02:18:37.754
Tell him I'm here.

02:18:38.544 --> 02:18:40.714
Ask him to help me.

02:18:43.795 --> 02:18:46.555
- What's your name?
- Hosenfeld.

02:18:46.805 --> 02:18:48.014
What?

02:20:30.079 --> 02:20:32.699
It was here, I'm certain of it.

02:20:34.709 --> 02:20:36.869
Well, it's not here now.

02:20:37.079 --> 02:20:41.209
I shouted, abused them. I'm not
proud of it, but that's what I did.

02:20:41.459 --> 02:20:42.880
I stood where you are now.

02:20:44.090 --> 02:20:47.430
There was a barbed wire
and this German came up to me.

02:20:48.760 --> 02:20:52.430
- You didn't catch his name?
- No.

02:20:54.600 --> 02:20:57.900
I'll ask at the factory.
They may know something.

02:20:58.305 --> 02:21:04.835
