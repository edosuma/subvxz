We have one man down,
completely covered in stab wounds.

00:19.042 --> 00:21.292
Well he's certainly dead.

00:23.018 --> 00:25.597
Good god.

00:41.741 --> 00:43.991

manicure kit with you?

00:43.993 --> 00:44.826
Yeah.

00:56.786 --> 00:59.869
Okay, our victim is one Rick Duval.

01:08.976 --> 01:13.059
From the report I got, it
said that he was alive.

01:13.967 --> 01:17.916
It was bound to happen sooner or later.

01:17.918 --> 01:20.120
I just didn't see it comin'.

01:20.122 --> 01:21.872
Who else would do it?

01:53.763 --> 01:56.430

02:03.031 --> 02:04.609
Hey.

02:04.611 --> 02:05.477

02:05.479 --> 02:07.378

02:07.380 --> 02:08.856
Yeah but I mean, what's going on here?

02:08.858 --> 02:09.933
What happened?

02:09.935 --> 02:11.685
We just got mugged.

02:12.767 --> 02:16.816
Come on Jackie, what really happened?

02:16.818 --> 02:17.651
Fine.

Of course I knew they hadn't been mugged.

02:29.476 --> 02:33.491
Toni had that eye, but
I'd seen that before.

02:33.493 --> 02:36.855
Both girls were completely
covered in blood,

Rick Duval was found

05:15.233 --> 05:18.414
I had just got married to Rick.

05:18.416 --> 05:19.749
And I hated her.

13:59.537 --> 14:01.395
And I have to watch while he marries some

14:01.397 --> 14:03.480
little tramp half my age.

14:04.414 --> 14:06.342
Okay, Lynette, that's it.

14:06.344 --> 14:07.179
That's it.

14:07.181 --> 14:09.147
I can't have you scarin' people like this.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.387
Fuck you Alan.

14:10.389 --> 14:12.115
Oh, in your sweetest dream.

14:12.117 --> 14:13.488
Fuck all you assholes!

14:16.720 --> 14:20.377
You don't think I know the
shit that goes on around here?

14:20.379 --> 14:22.118
You're just lucky I don't call the cops.

14:22.120 --> 14:22.951
Lynette.

14:22.953 --> 14:24.917
Lynette, come on, you gotta get out.

14:24.919 --> 14:25.815
Good bye.

14:25.817 --> 14:28.353
Fuck you, I'm goin'.

14:28.355 --> 14:29.188
Bye bye.

14:31.450 --> 14:33.450
Welcome to Devil's Cove.

14:35.401 --> 14:37.624
Rick, I want out, I am so serious.

14:37.626 --> 14:38.701
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:38.703 --> 14:40.263
Like, there's nothing to do here.

14:40.265 --> 14:42.465
You promised me a lot of things and yet,

14:42.467 --> 14:44.248
all we do is go to Devil's Cove.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.416
Yeah, look, it's Devil's Cove, it's not

14:46.418 --> 14:47.965
the Taj Mahal, okay?

14:47.967 --> 14:50.332
It was fine the first
couple of days but every night

14:50.334 --> 14:51.871
- that's all we go...
- Things will get better.

14:51.873 --> 14:52.941
We'll go places again.

14:52.943 --> 14:55.159
We're just here to regroup
a little, that's all.

14:55.161 --> 14:56.014
But you promised me the world.

14:56.016 --> 14:57.158
But I've gotta make
some fuckin' money first.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.560
Not a little corner
place where, you know,

14:58.562 --> 14:59.681
people go and get drunk.

14:59.683 --> 15:01.804
Listen, I said I've
got deals coming through,

15:01.806 --> 15:04.024
we're marking money, and then, we'll go.

15:04.026 --> 15:05.599
I don't even know anybody
here, you know that, right?

15:05.601 --> 15:07.338
'Cause you seemed pretty
keen to come fucking with me

15:07.340 --> 15:08.171
a few months ago.

15:08.173 --> 15:09.265
Crazy Lynette, huh?

15:09.267 --> 15:11.625
Who do I have, this Jackie person?

15:11.627 --> 15:14.321
It's not working for me,
Rick, and I just hope

15:14.323 --> 15:15.953
you'll understand why.

15:15.955 --> 15:17.864
I want out of Devil's Cove, okay?

15:17.866 --> 15:18.840
It is not the place for me.

15:18.842 --> 15:19.673
You'll get used to it.

15:19.675 --> 15:21.336
I don't want to be here.

15:21.338 --> 15:22.198
I can't fucking win.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.759
Women everywhere are
fucking giving me shit.

15:25.601 --> 15:27.233
Hey Rick, hey Rick.

15:27.235 --> 15:29.616
I'm gonna do it this time, really, I am.

15:29.618 --> 15:30.449
What the hell?

15:30.451 --> 15:32.831
Hey, look at me, I'm gonna kill myself.

15:32.833 --> 15:34.648
- Rick!
- Do you not see her?

15:34.650 --> 15:37.390
Look at me, I'm gonna do it.

15:37.392 --> 15:38.344
Rick.

15:38.346 --> 15:40.282
Where are you going?

15:40.284 --> 15:42.071
Okay, you're just gonna
pretend that she's not

15:42.073 --> 15:42.904
there right now?

15:42.906 --> 15:43.737
Baby, come on.

15:43.739 --> 15:45.289
Hey Rick, come back here.

15:45.291 --> 15:47.474
Do you not see that
she's outside our window?

15:47.476 --> 15:49.596
This is exactly why I wanna go.

15:49.598 --> 15:50.429
Rick.

15:50.431 --> 15:53.604
Look it, can we just leave?

15:53.606 --> 15:54.861
Fuck you Rick.

15:54.863 --> 15:57.392
Rick, come back here.

15:57.394 --> 15:58.775
I still love you.

16:00.778 --> 16:02.216
That bitch.

I'm gonna kill myself, I'm
really gonna kill myself.

16:14.211 --> 16:15.101
Don't you hear me?

16:15.103 --> 16:18.269
Don't, you never pay attention to me.

16:18.271 --> 16:20.072
You never listen.

16:20.074 --> 16:22.991
I'm trying to tell you, I love you.

16:24.575 --> 16:28.559
I'm here, I want you back,
don't you understand?

16:28.561 --> 16:30.662
She's not as good as me.

16:30.664 --> 16:33.308
That little bitch, she's
just a little bitch.

16:33.310 --> 16:36.574

19:05.240 --> 19:07.741
I don't know what it was about her.

19:07.743 --> 19:09.494
Maybe it was the way she poured her beer

19:09.496 --> 19:12.590
or how she looked at me, or
the way she entered the room.

19:12.592 --> 19:15.842
I don't know, but, after that night, I,

19:16.935 --> 19:20.251
I no longer saw her as an enemy.

19:20.253 --> 19:23.003
In a way, I saw her as my savior.

Come in.

20:33.781 --> 20:35.614
Sit down, have a beer.

20:38.084 --> 20:38.917
So,

Stan kick you out?

20:41.419 --> 20:42.815
Mhm.

20:42.817 --> 20:43.648
It's okay.

20:43.650 --> 20:46.393
He'll have forgotten by tomorrow.

20:46.395 --> 20:47.748
So.

20:47.750 --> 20:50.167
It's gotta be different
from the city here, huh?

20:50.169 --> 20:51.002
Yeah.

20:52.423 --> 20:54.479
Do you miss home?

20:54.481 --> 20:55.564
Not really.

20:56.606 --> 20:57.439
Wow.

20:58.383 --> 20:59.966
Must have been bad.

21:02.444 --> 21:05.342
Everyone in this place has a secret.

21:05.344 --> 21:08.763
Everyone has been in jail at least once.

21:08.765 --> 21:11.932
I was in for murder, Stan for assault.

21:12.993 --> 21:14.232
To you?

21:14.234 --> 21:15.762
No.

21:15.764 --> 21:19.205
Although I could have reported him.

21:19.207 --> 21:22.375
I prefer to make his life a misery.

21:22.377 --> 21:24.710
And I'm worse than any jail.

21:26.142 --> 21:28.392
This place is a black hole.

21:29.264 --> 21:32.347
Come here innocent, and leave guilty.

21:44.784 --> 21:47.060
Mind if I stay over?

21:47.062 --> 21:47.931
Uh.

21:47.933 --> 21:50.324
Well, Rick's asleep.

21:50.326 --> 21:53.159
I'll be gone before he wakes up.

21:54.432 --> 21:55.994
Sure.

21:55.996 --> 21:59.213
Okay, you should have everything you need.

21:59.215 --> 22:00.928
Come sit.

22:09.649 --> 22:12.985
So, you ever been with a woman before?

22:12.987 --> 22:13.820
No.

22:15.630 --> 22:16.463
Relax.

23:35.270 --> 23:36.713
Did he do that?

23:36.715 --> 23:37.548
Yeah.

23:41.879 --> 23:43.814
What did Rick do?

23:43.816 --> 23:45.418
What?

23:45.420 --> 23:49.820
You said that everyone in
Devil's Cove did something.

23:49.822 --> 23:51.239
What did Rick do?

23:53.717 --> 23:56.384
You really don't know, do you?

23:59.177 --> 24:00.760
Rick raped someone.

24:04.878 --> 24:09.343
Sentenced to 10 years,
got out after six months.

24:09.345 --> 24:12.352
I should get out of
here before he wakes up.

24:12.354 --> 24:13.265
Wait.

24:13.267 --> 24:14.699
Where are you going?

24:14.701 --> 24:17.110
Back home, to Stan.

24:17.112 --> 24:18.547
Didn't he kick you out?

24:18.549 --> 24:20.466
He'll have forgotten.

24:22.163 --> 24:23.895
It was a pretty cool night.

24:23.897 --> 24:25.064
See you later.

24:35.152 --> 24:38.940
Definitely a change
developed between the girls.

24:38.942 --> 24:40.943
Almost over night they became inseparable.

24:40.945 --> 24:44.112
I felt things I'd never felt before.

24:46.388 --> 24:49.805
Things I'd never felt with any man, like,

24:50.651 --> 24:51.484
her eyes.

24:53.083 --> 24:56.295
The way they looked at me and

24:56.297 --> 25:01.088
the freedom she had and they
way she commanded a room.

25:01.090 --> 25:04.378
And, I realized that I had never actually

25:04.380 --> 25:06.807
been in love before.

25:06.809 --> 25:11.303
She had a hold on me I
just couldn't explain.

25:11.305 --> 25:12.489
I knew she wasn't a saint.

25:12.491 --> 25:14.491

That's D-U-V-A-L.

27:06.304 --> 27:10.304
Yeah, I probably behaved
pretty irresponsibly.

27:11.736 --> 27:13.595
Fine, I may have tried them once.

27:13.597 --> 27:14.987
Twice, even.

27:14.989 --> 27:17.928
But I never dealt them, okay?

27:17.930 --> 27:18.763
Mm-mm.

27:29.404 --> 27:30.237
Alan.

27:31.104 --> 27:33.117
Let's start with you.

27:33.119 --> 27:35.757
Hey Brads, I got this.

27:35.759 --> 27:36.917
This is my fault.

27:36.919 --> 27:38.669
Can we talk about it?

27:45.920 --> 27:47.507
Hey Brads.

27:47.509 --> 27:49.450
This is all my fault.

27:49.452 --> 27:50.934
You see,

27:50.936 --> 27:52.323
I've been going through a personal crisis

27:52.325 --> 27:54.426
and I got the stuff.

27:54.428 --> 27:56.265
Jackie, what are you thikin'?

27:56.267 --> 27:57.692
You just got out of jail.

27:57.694 --> 28:00.194
Yeah, I know, but you see...

28:03.787 --> 28:05.037
I found a lump.

28:06.576 --> 28:08.093
Right here, do you wanna look?

28:08.095 --> 28:11.171
You know, I'm not sure
exactly what kind of hold

28:11.173 --> 28:13.090
Jackie had over George.

28:16.348 --> 28:19.415
And what I'd say, he was
fairly smitten with her.

28:19.417 --> 28:21.489
That was Jackie getting
away with stuff like that

28:21.491 --> 28:22.481
all the time.

28:22.483 --> 28:24.150
You're free to go.

28:35.107 --> 28:37.357
I could just kill myself.

28:43.124 --> 28:44.735
Hey.

28:44.737 --> 28:46.407
When did you get this car?

28:46.409 --> 28:48.326
I stole it from Stan.

28:51.124 --> 28:52.385
You wanna take it for a spin?

28:52.387 --> 28:53.218
What?

28:53.220 --> 28:54.051
- Me?
- Yeah.

28:54.053 --> 28:56.068
Hell yeah, this is fucking awesome.

28:56.070 --> 28:57.314
Hop on in.

28:57.316 --> 29:01.632
Oh my god, Jackie,
this is fucking amazing.

29:01.634 --> 29:04.607
You're pretty cool, I must say.

29:04.609 --> 29:05.553
Pretty cool car.

29:05.555 --> 29:06.916
Yeah.

29:06.918 --> 29:09.513

it's gone, thank god.

30:29.468 --> 30:30.904
We've been on and off for years

30:30.906 --> 30:34.556
and he wanted to marry me but I didn't.

30:34.558 --> 30:38.308
And he blamed me for
what I went to jail for.

30:39.908 --> 30:41.491
And when I got out,

30:42.535 --> 30:44.406
I had no place to go.

30:44.408 --> 30:47.756
My mom wanted nothing to do with me, and,

30:47.758 --> 30:49.449
so I moved back in with him.

30:49.451 --> 30:50.876
But he hits you.

30:50.878 --> 30:52.757
Yeah, well.

30:52.759 --> 30:55.759
You'd know about that, wouldn't you?

30:57.499 --> 30:59.996
My ex-boyfriend used to hit me, so,

30:59.998 --> 31:01.856
I know what that's like.

31:01.858 --> 31:03.978
I'm not talking about your ex, honey.

31:03.980 --> 31:06.127
I'm talking about Rick.

31:06.129 --> 31:07.962
Rick doesn't hit me.

31:09.035 --> 31:09.868
Not yet.

31:13.458 --> 31:14.291

31:15.659 --> 31:17.137

31:17.139 --> 31:19.384

31:21.553 --> 31:22.384

31:22.386 --> 31:24.136

31:39.316 --> 31:41.516
Well you can be free.

31:41.518 --> 31:44.985
Just need to start
thinking about yourself.

31:44.987 --> 31:45.903
Forget about other people.

31:45.905 --> 31:47.988
Make yourself number one.

31:52.536 --> 31:54.004
We should probably head back

31:54.006 --> 31:55.403

Yes, I think she does.

32:16.471 --> 32:18.180
You have a problem with that?

32:18.182 --> 32:19.963
Yeah, Jackie doesn't like anybody.

32:19.965 --> 32:20.796
Next week she's gonna
move on to someone else.

32:20.798 --> 32:22.290
Yeah, well maybe I
know her better than you.

32:22.292 --> 32:25.292
She doesn't give a shit about you.

32:26.651 --> 32:27.514

32:28.630 --> 32:30.231
It doesn't matter to me.

32:30.233 --> 32:32.211
She killed her fuckin' baby!

32:32.213 --> 32:34.073
Yeah, your girlfriend's a fuckin' monster!

32:34.075 --> 32:35.955
I don't believe it, they
wouldn't just let her out.

32:35.957 --> 32:37.309

32:45.112 --> 32:49.173
Very jealous of my
relationship with Jackie.

32:49.175 --> 32:53.342
He hated that I could love
someone other than him.

33:03.838 --> 33:05.904
What happened?

33:05.906 --> 33:07.009
Nothing.

33:07.011 --> 33:08.855
Just ran into a wall.

33:08.857 --> 33:09.688

You're my fuckin' wife!

35:43.792 --> 35:46.349
Well maybe I don't wanna be your wife.

35:53.994 --> 35:55.223
Get over here.

35:55.225 --> 35:56.725
Right fuckin' now.

36:01.413 --> 36:03.791
You'll never get away from me.

36:03.793 --> 36:05.253
Get off of me.

36:05.255 --> 36:06.348
You're mine.

36:06.350 --> 36:07.731
Let me go.

36:07.733 --> 36:09.807
You're fucking not going anywhere.

36:09.809 --> 36:10.697
Rick, stop!

36:10.699 --> 36:12.866
You better not leave me.

36:18.209 --> 36:19.042

Asshole!

37:07.900 --> 37:09.208
Toni.

37:09.210 --> 37:10.367
Toni.

37:10.369 --> 37:11.202
Hey.

37:12.928 --> 37:13.759
Jackie.

37:13.761 --> 37:14.592
Here, take the knife.

37:14.594 --> 37:15.844
Finish him off.

37:17.131 --> 37:18.881
What have you done?

37:32.113 --> 37:34.481
Come on.

37:52.346 --> 37:54.013
Come on Al, open up.

37:58.257 --> 38:01.303
Holy fuck, Jackie, what happened?

38:01.305 --> 38:03.055
We just got mugged.

38:03.903 --> 38:07.224
Come on Jackie, what really happened?

38:07.226 --> 38:08.731
Where's Rick?

38:08.733 --> 38:11.400
Pissed me off so I killed him.

38:12.282 --> 38:15.232
I really didn't wanna believe it, but,

38:15.234 --> 38:19.492
but then I looked at
Toni, oh, not Toni, and,

38:19.494 --> 38:23.583
and I saw that blood and
god I knew it was true.

38:29.781 --> 38:30.614
Jackie.

38:33.642 --> 38:34.475
Jackie.

38:50.853 --> 38:52.770

38:58.668 --> 38:59.499
That would be me, sir.

38:59.501 --> 39:01.686
What seems to be the officer, problem?

39:01.688 --> 39:03.760
We have reason to
believe that Jackie McGann

39:03.762 --> 39:06.030
and Toni Duval are here.

39:06.032 --> 39:08.730
Oh, they were, but they're gone.

39:08.732 --> 39:10.647
Would you mind it if we
looked around a little bit?

39:10.649 --> 39:12.235
No, please, go ahead.

39:12.237 --> 39:13.874
All right, let's start over there.

39:13.876 --> 39:15.516
Excuse me, sir?

39:15.518 --> 39:18.018
You're gonna have to stand up.

39:23.137 --> 39:24.554
What's your name?

39:27.022 --> 39:28.376
You and I are having a talk later.

39:28.378 --> 39:30.436
How are you doin' officer?

39:30.438 --> 39:33.715
Why don't come sit over here with me?

39:33.717 --> 39:36.917
Hey, good lookin'.

39:36.919 --> 39:39.921
How are you doin' today, huh?

39:39.923 --> 39:43.448
Why don't come sit over here with me?

39:43.450 --> 39:44.283
Come on.

39:46.866 --> 39:49.349
I might as well kill myself.

39:54.121 --> 39:56.339
Oh my god.

39:56.341 --> 39:58.346
Jackie, what are we gonna do?

39:58.348 --> 40:00.092
What are we gonna do?

40:00.094 --> 40:02.511
We drive hon, and we drive.

40:03.941 --> 40:06.856
I can still smell the blood.

40:06.858 --> 40:09.496

40:35.253 --> 40:37.345
Hey, we had to do this okay?

40:37.347 --> 40:38.575
You couldn't keep on
living with him the way

40:38.577 --> 40:40.244
he was treating you.

41:05.983 --> 41:08.746
Why do you need to go to the ATM?

41:08.748 --> 41:09.708
We need money.

41:09.710 --> 41:10.910

Uh, sure.

41:53.708 --> 41:54.715
Hey big guy.

41:54.717 --> 41:57.775
Hey, that's my cousin Neil.

41:57.777 --> 41:59.556
I'm Cassandra.

41:59.558 --> 42:00.808
This is Stacey.

42:02.017 --> 42:02.850
Bobby.

42:04.238 --> 42:08.702
So, uh, how come a hot
guy like you's single?

42:08.704 --> 42:11.055
What, what makes you think I'm single?

42:11.057 --> 42:12.307
It's obvious.

42:14.400 --> 42:15.589
Um.

42:15.591 --> 42:17.837
You girls new here?

42:17.839 --> 42:19.939
Just moved to the neighborhood.

42:19.941 --> 42:21.010
I haven't seen you before.

42:21.012 --> 42:23.203
Well, what do you do?

42:23.205 --> 42:25.372
Whatever you like, baby.

42:26.968 --> 42:29.571
So uh, you got a nice, big house?

42:29.573 --> 42:31.112
I do.

42:31.114 --> 42:32.607
You got a big bed?

42:32.609 --> 42:35.060
I love a guy with a big bed.

42:35.062 --> 42:38.038
- It'll fit all three of us?
- I do.

42:38.040 --> 42:40.873
Let's go back to yours.

42:53.333 --> 42:57.493
All right, you guys can sleep
on the couch there and, um,

42:57.495 --> 43:02.155
we'll be in my big bedroom
just right down here.

43:03.877 --> 43:08.155
So uh, you have pawn
shops in the neighborhood?

43:08.157 --> 43:11.232
Yeah, just right up the street.

43:11.234 --> 43:12.758
I wanna sell this watch.

43:12.760 --> 43:13.593
Why?

43:16.474 --> 43:17.307
Hey.

43:18.490 --> 43:20.490
You wanna have some fun?

43:28.150 --> 43:30.064
Please, don't smoke in here.

43:30.066 --> 43:30.897
Why?

43:30.899 --> 43:32.366
Don't you like the smell?

43:32.368 --> 43:34.575
It's against the rules.

43:34.577 --> 43:36.898
Your cousin doesn't mind.

43:36.900 --> 43:37.925
Yeah.

43:37.927 --> 43:39.514
Your loss.

43:39.516 --> 43:40.683
You okay baby?

43:48.283 --> 43:50.200
Here's some blankets.

43:53.143 --> 43:54.226
Night boys.

44:10.505 --> 44:12.081
Why, Toni?

44:12.083 --> 44:13.916
I didn't deserve this.

44:15.364 --> 44:16.195
Why?

44:22.202 --> 44:23.535
Wake up loser.

44:28.258 --> 44:29.736
Tell me where you fucking
money is or I'll blow

44:29.738 --> 44:31.071
your brains out.

44:32.638 --> 44:34.221
My wallet's here.

44:37.747 --> 44:39.394
Come on, please, please.

44:39.396 --> 44:40.927
I don't know.

44:40.929 --> 44:43.833
It's kind of fun watching
the moron beg for his life.

44:43.835 --> 44:44.668
Down.

44:46.771 --> 44:49.708
You know, I don't think
you really wanna live.

44:49.710 --> 44:51.590
No, no come on.

44:51.592 --> 44:53.310
I'm my mom's only child.

44:53.312 --> 44:55.539
Oh is that right?

44:55.541 --> 44:57.652
Bet you after she had you
she didn't want anymore.

44:57.654 --> 44:59.362
No.

44:59.364 --> 45:00.197
Down.

45:03.555 --> 45:05.432
Geez, you're pathetic.

45:05.434 --> 45:07.934
And you couldn't even fuck me.

45:10.207 --> 45:13.572
You know Bobby, I think
the world is a better place

45:13.574 --> 45:15.522
without you in it.

45:15.524 --> 45:17.511
Is anybody except your mama gonna miss

45:17.513 --> 45:20.596
this big, useless waste of resources?

45:23.500 --> 45:25.841
You're still a virgin, I bet.

45:25.843 --> 45:30.440
And let's face it, no woman
is ever gonna wanna fuck you.

45:30.442 --> 45:33.692
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!

45:36.490 --> 45:37.559
I'm doing you a favor.

45:42.658 --> 45:43.948
Whoa, what's going on, what's going on?

45:46.571 --> 45:48.085
Come on.

45:51.553 --> 45:53.147
Oh my god you
just killed those guys.

45:53.149 --> 45:55.391
You drive, I'll count the money.

45:55.393 --> 45:57.500
Shut the fuck up.

45:57.502 --> 45:58.952
Just shut the fuck up and drive, okay?

45:58.954 --> 46:00.544
They did nothing to us.

46:00.546 --> 46:03.042
This was supposed to be
fun, we're not murderers.

46:03.044 --> 46:07.534
Geez, keep
your fucking voice down.

46:20.558 --> 46:23.125
They were lesbians.

46:23.127 --> 46:24.794
Like, real lesbians.

46:31.687 --> 46:34.854
I didn't really know what they wanted.

46:36.277 --> 46:40.777
But I thought maybe they
were interested in one of us.

46:45.289 --> 46:50.289
I was kind of scared that
they might wanna have sex.

46:50.378 --> 46:53.255
Which I wouldn't have minded,
except I kind of never

46:53.257 --> 46:54.507
had sex before.

46:58.410 --> 47:02.417
No, okay, I mean I guess
I have sex all the time,

47:02.419 --> 47:04.669
just not with anybody else.

47:07.198 --> 47:10.198
But I guess that doesn't count.

47:10.200 --> 47:11.832
Wow.

47:11.834 --> 47:13.667
That slob was only 50.

47:16.078 --> 47:19.497
Could have sworn he was almost 65.

47:19.499 --> 47:21.600
Jackie, we can't do
this, we need a plan...

47:21.602 --> 47:24.318
Maybe I'll get more for the watch.

47:24.320 --> 47:25.151
What are you talking about?

47:25.153 --> 47:27.009
A watch? You just killed a guy.

47:27.011 --> 47:28.519
The cops are looking for us.

47:28.521 --> 47:30.767
We've gotta find a place
where we can hock that watch.

47:30.769 --> 47:32.903
And all you can think about is a watch?

47:32.905 --> 47:34.329
Money for a watch?

47:34.331 --> 47:35.162
We gotta get the hell out of here.

47:35.164 --> 47:36.948
Aren't you worried about
getting the electric chair?

47:36.950 --> 47:38.357
We're gonna need more money though.

47:38.359 --> 47:40.898
I mean hell, if we're gonna
get he fuck out of here

47:40.900 --> 47:41.816
we're gonna need some more money.

47:41.818 --> 47:42.649
They're gonna kill us.

47:42.651 --> 47:43.785
They're not gonna stop until they find us

47:43.787 --> 47:45.944
and they're gonna give
us the electric chair.

47:45.946 --> 47:46.779
Yeah.

47:47.968 --> 47:49.551
We need more gas.

47:50.690 --> 47:52.316
We need to stop for gas.

47:52.318 --> 47:53.565
Well we gotta do what we gotta do,

47:53.567 --> 47:55.650
we'll stop for gas, okay.

47:58.780 --> 48:00.409
Who reported it?

48:00.411 --> 48:05.411
Cousin who lived here reported
it at Rivervale Station.

48:05.725 --> 48:07.524
They shot at him but he's okay,

48:07.526 --> 48:11.693
said it was a quote, "A
blonde and a black chick."

48:13.634 --> 48:15.002

48:15.004 --> 48:16.670

48:21.644 --> 48:22.821

outside of a gas station

50:44.187 --> 50:45.380
this morning.

50:45.382 --> 50:47.644
The two girls fled the
small town of Devil's Cove

50:47.646 --> 50:50.513
after the brutal murder
of Duval's husband.

50:50.515 --> 50:52.850
They are now suspects in a second murder,

50:52.852 --> 50:55.433
a 50-year-old, Robert McCormick.

50:55.435 --> 50:57.984
McCormick invited the two
girls back to his place

50:57.986 --> 51:00.684
after meeting them at a bar.

51:00.686 --> 51:02.019
What the fuck?

51:05.338 --> 51:07.255

51:14.506 --> 51:18.525
I hope they lock the bitch up for life.

51:21.617 --> 51:24.816
Stan is a lost cause and Jackie knew it.

51:24.818 --> 51:26.410
Took advantage of it.

51:26.412 --> 51:29.998
You know, they were
engaged, they had a kid,

51:30.000 --> 51:34.765
they had everything, but he
was never the same after,

51:34.767 --> 51:37.017
well, after their kid died.

51:38.629 --> 51:41.296
I don't know, can you blame him?

52:20.362 --> 52:22.561
Once in the apartment,
McGann fired shots

52:22.563 --> 52:25.323
at McCormick, murdering
him and attempting to

52:25.325 --> 52:28.169
murder his cousin, Ian Dawson.

52:28.171 --> 52:31.975
Dawson fortunately escaped
and is now in police custody

52:31.977 --> 52:33.520
for questioning.

52:33.522 --> 52:35.769
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

52:35.771 --> 52:36.951
Jackie.

52:36.953 --> 52:40.081
No
more rain, Devil's Cove.

52:40.083 --> 52:41.500
I need a drink.

52:56.228 --> 52:57.760
I got us some booze.

52:57.762 --> 52:59.122
Wonderful.

52:59.124 --> 53:00.782
That solves everything.

53:00.784 --> 53:01.615
What the fuck is wrong with you?

53:01.617 --> 53:02.601
Oh I don't know.

53:02.603 --> 53:05.986
Maybe it's because my husband,
who I loved, is now dead.

53:05.988 --> 53:08.866
Maybe it's because you
killed him and two other guys

53:08.868 --> 53:09.917
who did nothing to us.

53:09.919 --> 53:11.532
Maybe it's because if I'm lucky,

53:11.534 --> 53:13.893
I'm looking to spend the rest
of my life in a jail cell

53:13.895 --> 53:15.533
all because I helped you.

53:15.535 --> 53:18.983
Okay, first of all,
nobody's gonna catch us, okay?

53:18.985 --> 53:20.354
Is that our plan?

53:20.356 --> 53:21.187
Yes.

53:21.189 --> 53:22.442
Flee to Mexico?

53:22.444 --> 53:24.404
They'll catch us at the border.

53:24.406 --> 53:26.835
I got a friend, okay?

53:26.837 --> 53:29.519
A man called Patterson.

53:29.521 --> 53:31.200
Expert in fake IDs.

53:31.202 --> 53:32.285
Check it out.

53:34.964 --> 53:37.689
We lose the car, we go
up to San Francisco,

53:37.691 --> 53:39.917
get some fake IDs, start our lives over.

53:39.919 --> 53:41.748
And how are we gonna
get to San Francisco

53:41.750 --> 53:43.219
if we lose the car?

53:43.221 --> 53:44.467
I got friends.

53:44.469 --> 53:46.062
Someone will give us theirs.

53:46.064 --> 53:49.503
Jackie, are you even aware
of how noticeable we are?

53:49.505 --> 53:51.579
Even in San Francisco,
we're going to stick out

53:51.581 --> 53:53.335
like sore thumbs.

53:53.337 --> 53:54.175
We're murderers.

53:54.177 --> 53:56.375
They won't stop until they catch us.

53:56.377 --> 53:57.596
Okay.

53:57.598 --> 53:59.815
First of all, nobody's
gonna give a shit about

53:59.817 --> 54:02.312
those two losers, okay?

54:02.314 --> 54:03.231
And second,

54:04.799 --> 54:07.813
Rick Duval wasn't exactly a saint.

54:07.815 --> 54:11.189
The cops wanted to get him for ages, okay?

54:11.191 --> 54:13.392
We did them a favor.

54:13.394 --> 54:16.466
If anything, they're gonna thank us.

54:16.468 --> 54:17.723
We killed a criminal.

54:17.725 --> 54:21.048
It's not like we killed
some poor, innocent

54:21.050 --> 54:22.224
little person.

54:22.226 --> 54:24.976
A what, a what, a what? A baby?

54:27.119 --> 54:29.369
What happened to your baby?

54:33.199 --> 54:34.032
Jackie!

54:34.900 --> 54:37.783
I can't believe you
listened to that shit, Toni.

54:37.785 --> 54:39.902
The least you could
do is tell me the truth.

54:39.904 --> 54:41.463
He died, okay?

54:41.465 --> 54:42.514
He just died.

54:42.516 --> 54:44.337
Just died?

54:44.339 --> 54:46.756
Don't you fucking judge me.

54:49.740 --> 54:50.611
Oh what?

54:50.613 --> 54:53.062
What is wrong with you?

54:53.064 --> 54:55.435
You just killed my husband.

54:55.437 --> 54:56.268
He had it comin'

54:56.270 --> 54:58.472
How can you say that?

54:58.474 --> 55:00.960
Keep your fucking voice down, okay?

55:00.962 --> 55:03.360
I can still smell the blood.

55:03.362 --> 55:04.193
Yeah?

55:04.195 --> 55:05.195
Get over it.

55:12.263 --> 55:13.253
Hey.

55:13.255 --> 55:14.499
It's okay.

55:14.501 --> 55:17.311
It's okay, just, don't think about it.

55:17.313 --> 55:21.631
Don't think about how
you put a gun to his head

55:21.633 --> 55:24.458
and you blew his brains
out and they splattered

55:24.460 --> 55:28.138
all over the floor and
there's Rick with a giant hole

55:28.140 --> 55:28.971
in his head.

55:28.973 --> 55:30.890
You did that, not me.

55:32.633 --> 55:34.350
You keep telling yourself that, kid.

55:34.352 --> 55:36.490
Don't you play me.

55:36.492 --> 55:39.557
I stood by you, I cared for you.

55:39.559 --> 55:41.617
I didn't want him dead.

55:41.619 --> 55:42.869
Yeah you did.

55:46.110 --> 55:47.553
I'm going to the cops.

55:47.555 --> 55:49.067
No, what the fuck?

55:49.069 --> 55:51.990
No, you're not going to the goddamn cops.

55:51.992 --> 55:53.548
No, no.

55:53.550 --> 55:55.698
And don't think that you
can go to the cops behind

55:55.700 --> 55:56.872
my back either, honey.

55:56.874 --> 55:58.566
You think the cops are
gonna take the word of

55:58.568 --> 56:01.018
a little black girl
with a criminal record?

56:01.020 --> 56:03.058
Your fingerprints were
all over the fucking gun.

56:03.060 --> 56:05.340
You're in it as much as I am, honey,

56:05.342 --> 56:08.632
so quit playing the fucking
grieving widow, okay?

56:08.634 --> 56:10.743
You're not going to the fucking cops.

56:10.745 --> 56:11.662

What the fuck?

59:22.532 --> 59:23.405
Did you kill him?

59:23.407 --> 59:24.238
Shut the fuck up.

59:24.240 --> 59:25.071
Why'd you even kill him?

59:25.073 --> 59:26.558
He did nothing to us.

59:26.560 --> 59:27.859
Come on.

59:27.861 --> 59:29.608
What the fuck, you're just
gonna leave his body there?

59:29.610 --> 59:31.935
Shut the fuck up, we
need to get out of here.

59:31.937 --> 59:33.609

guy for no fucking reason!

I can't do this, I can't do this Jackie.

59:45.279 --> 59:48.354

59:48.356 --> 59:49.769
This is not fun.

59:49.771 --> 59:51.579
He didn't give us enough.

59:51.581 --> 59:52.664
We need help.

59:55.269 --> 59:58.013
Just, I can't do this okay?

59:58.015 --> 59:59.750
Just shut the fuck up okay?

59:59.752 --> 01:00:00.929
Drive.

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:02.898
Get us the fuck out of here.

01:00:12.771 --> 01:00:14.889
I'm Rebecca Lawson
with Channel Six News,

01:00:14.891 --> 01:00:17.092
and I am here with Detective Myers of the

01:00:17.094 --> 01:00:18.536
Devil's Cove PD.

01:00:18.538 --> 01:00:20.239
Can you tell us what
happened with the murder

01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:21.773
of Mr. Duval?

01:00:21.775 --> 01:00:24.553
Well it's certainly
the most brutal murder

01:00:24.555 --> 01:00:26.602
that I've ever seen.

01:00:26.604 --> 01:00:29.128
Rick Duval's body was completely covered

01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:31.721
in gruesome stab wounds.

01:00:31.723 --> 01:00:34.138
Are there any suspects in custody?

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:35.702
Right now we're gonna
reserve that information

01:00:35.704 --> 01:00:36.691
to ourselves.

01:00:36.693 --> 01:00:37.778
As soon as we have something
we can share with you,

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:39.158
we will.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.591
We'll never make it to San Francisco.

01:00:41.593 --> 01:00:42.424
They'll get us.

01:00:42.426 --> 01:00:44.411
They'll have the road blocks up.

01:00:44.413 --> 01:00:45.330
So, uh...

01:00:52.491 --> 01:00:54.057
What the fuck?

01:00:54.059 --> 01:00:56.187
You had your phone on you this whole time?

01:00:56.189 --> 01:00:58.416
- Just quit whining.
- They can track us.

01:00:58.418 --> 01:01:02.251
It's Stan's, I've never
used it, we're fine.

01:01:04.676 --> 01:01:06.446
And what about a motive, detective?

01:01:06.448 --> 01:01:07.471
Again, this is an open investigation.

01:01:07.473 --> 01:01:09.404
I hope you'll respect that.

01:01:09.406 --> 01:01:11.196
As soon as we can share
something with you,

01:01:11.198 --> 01:01:12.085
you'll be the first that we call.

01:01:12.087 --> 01:01:13.314
Hello?

01:01:13.316 --> 01:01:15.066
Brads, it's Jackie.

01:01:22.002 --> 01:01:23.169
What the fuck?

01:01:24.897 --> 01:01:27.480
He just fuckin' hung up on me.

01:01:37.233 --> 01:01:38.400
What the fuck?

01:01:39.282 --> 01:01:40.115
Asshole.

01:01:41.232 --> 01:01:42.065
Try Al.

01:01:51.742 --> 01:01:52.792
Hello?

01:01:52.794 --> 01:01:53.821
Al.

01:01:53.823 --> 01:01:55.477
It's Jackie.

01:02:03.407 --> 01:02:05.484
Fuckin' assholes.

01:02:05.486 --> 01:02:07.705
Great fuckin' friends we've got.

01:02:07.707 --> 01:02:08.540
Shit.

01:02:14.214 --> 01:02:15.719
Okay.

01:02:15.721 --> 01:02:18.143
I know someone who can help.

01:02:18.145 --> 01:02:19.089
We're gonna have to go that way.

01:02:19.091 --> 01:02:22.341
Turn left when we get to the stop sign.

01:02:35.713 --> 01:02:37.136
Where are we?

01:02:37.138 --> 01:02:38.964
You'll see.

01:02:38.966 --> 01:02:39.797
What is this?

01:02:39.799 --> 01:02:41.534
One of your drug dealer friend's house?

01:02:41.536 --> 01:02:42.970
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

01:02:42.972 --> 01:02:45.249
Do you not realize
we're wanted by the law?

01:02:45.251 --> 01:02:46.082
Quit whining.

01:02:46.084 --> 01:02:47.522
Police are chasing us
and you're saying maybe?

01:02:47.524 --> 01:02:48.355
Shut the fuck up, all right?

01:02:48.357 --> 01:02:49.634
I got this figured out, all right?

01:02:49.636 --> 01:02:50.598
Okay well can
you at least tell me

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.740
where we're going?

01:02:57.657 --> 01:02:59.548
What the hell are you doin' here?

01:02:59.550 --> 01:03:00.608
Hey mom.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.068
Great to see ya.

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:03.816
Been a long time, huh?

01:03:03.818 --> 01:03:05.818
Meet my girlfriend Toni.

01:03:07.943 --> 01:03:10.536
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:03:10.538 --> 01:03:13.538
The whole goddamn
country's looking for you.

01:03:13.540 --> 01:03:16.187
You're wanted for three murders.

01:03:16.189 --> 01:03:17.703
I thought it was four.

01:03:17.705 --> 01:03:20.048
Which one got away?

01:03:20.050 --> 01:03:22.258
Cops were around here yesterday.

01:03:22.260 --> 01:03:24.584
Just a matter of time before they're back.

01:03:24.586 --> 01:03:26.527
Hell, they're probably
even watchin' the house.

01:03:26.529 --> 01:03:28.408
Yeah, yeah, yeah, look.

01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:30.656
Just give me five grand, give me your car,

01:03:30.658 --> 01:03:32.126
and I'll piss off out of
here, you'll never have to

01:03:32.128 --> 01:03:33.259
see me again, I promise.

01:03:33.261 --> 01:03:35.948
You expect me to help you
out like I did last time?

01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:39.115
Spend thousands of dollars on lawyers.

01:03:39.117 --> 01:03:41.580
Something like that, yeah.

01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.663
What is wrong with you, girl?

01:03:47.851 --> 01:03:50.925
You killed that Duval guy, didn't you?

01:03:50.927 --> 01:03:51.760
Yeah.

01:03:53.636 --> 01:03:55.629
And the other two?

01:03:55.631 --> 01:03:56.464
Mhm.

01:03:57.968 --> 01:04:01.699
Thank god your father died
before you ever fell pregnant.

01:04:01.701 --> 01:04:05.784
Shut the fuck up and
give me the goddamn money.

01:04:07.284 --> 01:04:08.999
There is no money Jackie.

01:04:09.001 --> 01:04:11.130
What, what about the money dad left me?

01:04:11.132 --> 01:04:12.761
That was used to pay your legal fees.

01:04:12.763 --> 01:04:13.594
What the fuck?

01:04:13.596 --> 01:04:15.345
You stole my money?

01:04:15.347 --> 01:04:17.200
It was never your money, Jackie!

01:04:17.202 --> 01:04:19.811
You know what you put me through.

01:04:19.813 --> 01:04:22.230
Please, this cry, cry, cry.

01:04:23.732 --> 01:04:25.982
And you took my grandson.

01:04:27.039 --> 01:04:29.039
He was my only grandson.

01:04:30.348 --> 01:04:33.015
And, and I lied for you, Jackie.

01:04:34.552 --> 01:04:36.091
I lied.

01:04:36.093 --> 01:04:39.674
I stood up in court and said
what a great mom you were.

01:04:39.676 --> 01:04:43.406
How you were always there for your kid.

01:04:43.408 --> 01:04:48.408
And he was always with me,
while you were out partyin'.

01:04:48.713 --> 01:04:50.575
Always you, you, you.

01:04:50.577 --> 01:04:52.394
And I never told them
about all the times you

01:04:52.396 --> 01:04:56.895
screamed that the baby
was ruining your life.

01:04:56.897 --> 01:05:01.314
Oh god, how he disappeared
and you never reported it.

01:05:03.628 --> 01:05:07.124
I never told 'em how you
disappeared and said that

01:05:07.126 --> 01:05:11.607
you were with the baby and you
kept coming back for stuff.

01:05:11.609 --> 01:05:15.365
But you never came for anything of his.

01:05:15.367 --> 01:05:17.784
Not his clothes, or his toys.

01:05:21.134 --> 01:05:21.967
Nothin'.

01:05:22.872 --> 01:05:27.289
And how you still said you
were together and you were

01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:31.243
gonna start this new life without me.

01:05:34.302 --> 01:05:39.302
Then his little body was
found in the river.

01:05:46.049 --> 01:05:49.299
I still lied, I said you were innocent.

01:05:56.052 --> 01:05:59.445
And I mortgaged my beautiful house

01:05:59.447 --> 01:06:01.614
with every dollar to prove

01:06:04.339 --> 01:06:05.589
your innocence.

01:06:12.764 --> 01:06:15.514
I don't need to hear this shit.

01:06:16.428 --> 01:06:17.261
Jackie.

01:06:18.618 --> 01:06:21.701
Is it true that you killed your baby?

01:06:24.722 --> 01:06:25.972
I need to know.

01:06:28.233 --> 01:06:29.066
Tell me!

01:06:30.061 --> 01:06:32.394
I deserve to know the truth.

01:06:36.273 --> 01:06:37.106
Tell me!

01:06:38.699 --> 01:06:41.366
Get your fuckin' hands off me.

01:06:42.852 --> 01:06:43.683
Oh, what, what?

01:06:43.685 --> 01:06:46.444
You fucking people just
cry and cry and cry.

01:06:46.446 --> 01:06:48.118
I'm trying to get us out
of this and you're going on

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.640
about the death of some kid
that happened years ago.

01:06:50.642 --> 01:06:52.657
Your own son.

01:06:52.659 --> 01:06:54.095
Did you kill him?

01:06:54.097 --> 01:06:56.099
Of course I killed him.

01:06:56.101 --> 01:06:57.408
Why?

01:06:57.410 --> 01:06:59.946
Because he was irritating me, okay?

01:06:59.948 --> 01:07:01.610
Now you know, so shut the fuck up.

01:07:01.612 --> 01:07:04.545
You're a fucking sociopath.

01:07:04.547 --> 01:07:07.048
Don't call me that.

01:07:07.050 --> 01:07:08.635
You're a murderer.

01:07:08.637 --> 01:07:09.838
You're evil!

01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.217
You killed my husband!

01:07:14.289 --> 01:07:17.326
Oh please, you wanted him dead.

01:07:17.328 --> 01:07:18.690
You don't fool me, honey.

01:07:18.692 --> 01:07:20.859
You hated that guy's guts.

01:07:25.152 --> 01:07:26.508
Get your hands off me.

01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:27.577
Get off of her.

01:07:27.579 --> 01:07:28.410
Bitch.

01:07:28.412 --> 01:07:29.243
Goddamn bitch.

01:07:29.245 --> 01:07:30.076
Get out of here.

01:07:30.078 --> 01:07:32.179
Just get out of my house.

01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:34.377
You think you can just come here with your

01:07:34.379 --> 01:07:37.576
black trash little
girlfriend and demand money?

01:07:37.578 --> 01:07:39.154
Well you can't anymore, Jackie.

01:07:39.156 --> 01:07:40.748
I am done with you.

01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:42.932
You are dead to me.

01:08:00.683 --> 01:08:01.679
Police.

01:08:01.681 --> 01:08:03.014
Police, open up.

01:08:03.996 --> 01:08:05.536
Mrs. McGann, open it.

01:08:05.538 --> 01:08:06.631
We're not letting them in.

01:08:06.633 --> 01:08:08.603
Toni, get the car and
meet me out back, now.

01:08:08.605 --> 01:08:10.063
Police, open this door!

01:08:10.065 --> 01:08:12.711
Toni, do it.

01:08:12.713 --> 01:08:13.834
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:08:13.836 --> 01:08:14.894
We're coming in.

01:08:14.896 --> 01:08:16.319
Get the gun, get the gun.

01:08:16.321 --> 01:08:19.011
We're gonna
break it down and come in.

01:08:19.013 --> 01:08:19.844
Get the fuck outside.

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:20.676
No.

01:08:20.679 --> 01:08:21.510
Police.

01:08:21.511 --> 01:08:22.343
What are you doing?

01:08:22.345 --> 01:08:24.430
I mean, you don't even
know how to use that thing.

01:08:24.432 --> 01:08:25.580
Stop it, Jackie.

01:08:25.582 --> 01:08:26.658
We're
gonna break it down.

01:08:26.661 --> 01:08:28.578
This has to stop now.

01:08:30.073 --> 01:08:31.491
Police, freeze!

01:08:33.523 --> 01:08:38.300
Put your hands up in the
air, turn around, bitch.

01:08:38.301 --> 01:08:39.941
Get your fucking hands off me.

01:08:39.943 --> 01:08:44.943
Yeah, this isn't your baby
you're dealing with now, bitch.

01:08:46.689 --> 01:08:47.917
Hey mom, guess you
don't have to worry about

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:49.582
that five grand anymore, huh?

01:08:49.585 --> 01:08:52.197
Will you get me a good
lawyer again, please?

01:08:52.198 --> 01:08:53.029
Please?

01:08:53.032 --> 01:08:55.688
I hope you burn in hell.

01:08:55.689 --> 01:08:56.865
Fucking bitch.

01:08:56.867 --> 01:08:58.867
There's loyalty for you.

01:09:03.790 --> 01:09:06.055
Miss McGann, do you have any remorse?

01:09:06.057 --> 01:09:08.227
What is your relationship
with Jackie McGann?

01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:09.326
Was the money worth it?

01:09:09.328 --> 01:09:10.725
That isn't what we said.

01:09:10.727 --> 01:09:11.865
Can you tell me what you're doing here

01:09:11.867 --> 01:09:13.028
at her mother's house?

01:09:13.029 --> 01:09:13.908
Did you kill three men?

01:09:13.911 --> 01:09:15.444
Yeah, yeah, of course.

01:09:15.447 --> 01:09:18.018
Did your husband beat you?

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:20.103
Thanks for coming guys.

01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:23.837
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:24.944 --> 01:09:26.970
Get your fucking hands off me you pervert.

01:09:26.973 --> 01:09:29.850
Shut up, you murdering slut.

01:09:29.853 --> 01:09:34.425
Get in there.

01:09:34.426 --> 01:09:37.319
Get her the hell out of here.

01:10:00.295 --> 01:10:01.128
Wait.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.647
Help me, Toni.

01:10:04.771 --> 01:10:05.604
Wait.

01:10:08.745 --> 01:10:11.069
Here, take the knife.

01:10:16.059 --> 01:10:17.392
Toni, help me.

01:10:18.332 --> 01:10:19.165
Help me.

01:10:24.113 --> 01:10:25.269
Okay,
so far, I'm not hearing

01:10:25.271 --> 01:10:26.300
any satisfactory answers.

01:10:26.302 --> 01:10:28.208
I felt like I had to
fight for Jackie because

01:10:28.210 --> 01:10:29.117
she had fought for me.

01:10:29.119 --> 01:10:32.088
I need to know exactly who did what.

01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:34.629
Who was the one who finally killed him?

01:10:34.631 --> 01:10:35.810
I can't remember.

01:10:35.812 --> 01:10:36.643
You know what?

01:10:36.645 --> 01:10:38.887
Now you're really, really pissing me off.

01:10:38.889 --> 01:10:42.168
And that's too bad because I
genuinely wanted to help you.

01:10:42.170 --> 01:10:43.486
So I'm gonna ask you again.

01:10:43.488 --> 01:10:46.464
Maybe this time, the message
will penetrate your brain,

01:10:46.466 --> 01:10:49.216
and you will be able to remember.

01:10:55.801 --> 01:10:57.186
Where's Rick?

01:10:57.188 --> 01:11:00.788
He pissed me off so I killed him.

01:11:12.539 --> 01:11:13.372
Toni?

01:11:32.676 --> 01:11:33.509
Police?

01:11:38.863 --> 01:11:41.196
I'd like to report a murder.

01:11:46.717 --> 01:11:47.800
Devil's Cove.

01:11:52.774 --> 01:11:53.607
Jackie.

01:11:55.804 --> 01:11:59.750
So Jackie was the one who instigated it.

01:11:59.752 --> 01:12:02.300
But you were the one who called the cops.

01:12:02.302 --> 01:12:04.040
This can work in your favor, Toni.

01:12:04.042 --> 01:12:06.686
I can get you off, but
I need you to help me.

01:12:06.688 --> 01:12:08.258
But what about the others?

01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:09.950
You can say that Jackie
forced you to go with her.

01:12:09.952 --> 01:12:12.470
You had no choice but to go along.

01:12:12.472 --> 01:12:15.139
But I need to know who did what.

01:12:18.199 --> 01:12:19.532
Rick, not now.

01:12:20.622 --> 01:12:22.278
Yeah, come on.

01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.357
Please, just,

01:12:24.359 --> 01:12:25.685
stop.

01:12:25.687 --> 01:12:27.210
Stop.

01:12:27.212 --> 01:12:28.045
Stop!

01:12:29.830 --> 01:12:31.040
You gotta fuckin'
realize Jackie's trouble.

01:12:31.042 --> 01:12:32.722
You don't own me!

01:12:35.559 --> 01:12:38.381
You're my fuckin' wife!

01:12:38.383 --> 01:12:40.271
Well maybe I don't wanna be your wife.

01:12:44.187 --> 01:12:45.184
Rick, no.

01:12:45.186 --> 01:12:46.663
Yes, fuckin' yeah.

01:12:46.665 --> 01:12:47.496
Rick, stop.

01:12:47.498 --> 01:12:48.329
You fuckin' want it.

01:12:48.331 --> 01:12:49.859
Rick no get off of me, stop.

01:12:49.861 --> 01:12:51.528
Stop, get off of me!

01:12:52.438 --> 01:12:53.938
Get off of me, no!

01:12:55.711 --> 01:12:56.794
No, stop, no!

01:12:58.169 --> 01:12:59.002
No!

01:13:00.318 --> 01:13:02.857
You'll never get away from me.

01:13:02.859 --> 01:13:04.526
Never get away from.

01:13:12.252 --> 01:13:15.227
Oh please, you wanted him dead.

01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:16.645
You don't fool me honey.

01:13:16.647 --> 01:13:18.814
You hated that guy's guts.

01:13:26.888 --> 01:13:28.971
He wasn't a bad person.

01:13:29.952 --> 01:13:32.702
He just didn't know when to stop.

01:13:37.111 --> 01:13:38.111
He loved me.

01:13:42.093 --> 01:13:44.908
But I'm not sorry he's dead.

01:13:44.910 --> 01:13:46.577
So you killed him?

01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:52.342
But Jackie started it.

01:13:52.344 --> 01:13:53.725
But,

01:13:53.727 --> 01:13:54.560
I,

01:13:55.472 --> 01:13:56.639
I fired the...

01:13:57.932 --> 01:14:00.027
Hold on, whoa, whoa, whoa, take it easy.

01:14:00.029 --> 01:14:01.112
Take it easy.

01:14:03.162 --> 01:14:03.995
It's okay.

01:14:05.899 --> 01:14:07.732
Here, have some water.

01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:16.013
Look, kid.

01:14:18.613 --> 01:14:21.196
I know you're not a bad person.

01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:25.564
And I know you haven't had
the easiest start in life.

01:14:25.566 --> 01:14:30.536
But that's no reason to
throw everything away now.

01:14:30.538 --> 01:14:32.479
If they find you guilty of
murder, you can kiss the rest

01:14:32.481 --> 01:14:34.190
of your life good bye.

01:14:34.192 --> 01:14:37.729
Even if you're found guilty
of just being an accomplice,

01:14:37.731 --> 01:14:41.064
you're lookin' at a minimum of 25 years.

01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:46.153
I don't think you deserve that.

01:14:50.801 --> 01:14:55.051
Now I'm familiar with your
late husband, Mr. Duval.

01:14:56.922 --> 01:14:58.422
He's a bad person.

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:03.350
I'm not saying that he deserved to die,

01:15:03.352 --> 01:15:05.019
I'm just saying that

01:15:06.247 --> 01:15:11.164
sometimes God just kind of
takes things into his own hands.

01:15:13.146 --> 01:15:15.146
Do you know what I mean?

01:15:17.168 --> 01:15:18.750
Yeah.

01:15:18.752 --> 01:15:22.414
And Jackie McGann, everybody
knows she was trouble.

01:15:22.416 --> 01:15:23.749
Always has been.

01:15:24.636 --> 01:15:29.386
I never, for a second, bought
that insanity plea of hers.

01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:37.183
She murdered her little
boy because her little boy

01:15:37.185 --> 01:15:40.435
was in her way, that's the only reason.

01:15:41.658 --> 01:15:44.178
The whole town knew it.

01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:45.013
Yeah.

01:15:50.901 --> 01:15:54.366
And we also knew that
she's the one that took

01:15:54.368 --> 01:15:56.618
care of the other two guys.

01:15:57.496 --> 01:16:00.246
You just happened to be with her.

01:16:10.684 --> 01:16:11.517
Sign it.

01:16:13.955 --> 01:16:15.310
What is it?

01:16:15.312 --> 01:16:17.538
It's your statement.

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:19.707
I wrote it for you myself.

01:16:21.016 --> 01:16:22.191
It says that you weren't even in the room

01:16:22.193 --> 01:16:24.919
when the murder took place,
and it says that Jackie held

01:16:24.921 --> 01:16:28.600
a gun up to your head and
forced you to go with her.

01:16:28.602 --> 01:16:32.691
My hands were all over
it, my fingerprints.

01:16:32.693 --> 01:16:34.644
That's explained in the statement.

01:16:34.646 --> 01:16:36.122
You were trying to get
the gun away from Jackie

01:16:36.124 --> 01:16:41.122
'cause you were trying to
save your husband's life.

01:16:41.124 --> 01:16:41.957
Sign it,

01:16:43.942 --> 01:16:48.282
and you get away, and
you get off, scot free.

01:16:48.284 --> 01:16:52.649
Jackie'll be the one
that pays for the murder.

01:16:52.651 --> 01:16:54.734
Come on, what do you say?

01:16:55.806 --> 01:16:56.639
Sign it.

01:16:59.076 --> 01:17:00.993
You took my grandson.

01:17:02.313 --> 01:17:04.397
My only grandson.

01:17:04.399 --> 01:17:05.742
Of course I killed him.

01:17:05.744 --> 01:17:06.864
Of course I killed him.

01:17:06.866 --> 01:17:08.684
Because he was irritating me, okay?

01:17:08.686 --> 01:17:10.644
Because he was irritating me, okay?

01:17:10.646 --> 01:17:14.896
You took my
grandson, my only grandson.

01:17:27.963 --> 01:17:28.952
So I take

01:17:28.954 --> 01:17:29.954
Miss McGann?

01:17:31.332 --> 01:17:33.023
You got any marijuana?

01:17:33.025 --> 01:17:34.395
What?

01:17:34.397 --> 01:17:35.421
Is she serious?

01:17:35.423 --> 01:17:38.090
I need a fucking joint, Myers.

01:17:39.205 --> 01:17:41.372
Fine, you got a cigarette?

01:17:42.421 --> 01:17:44.753
Jackie, there's not gonna
be any smoking in here,

01:17:44.755 --> 01:17:46.591
do you understand?

01:17:46.593 --> 01:17:47.846
Now are you gonna tell
us what the fuck happened

01:17:47.848 --> 01:17:48.931

01:17:49.793 --> 01:17:51.333

01:18:02.716 --> 01:18:04.350
I like it, I like it, I like it.

01:18:04.352 --> 01:18:07.435
Patterson, get this
trash out of my office.

01:18:07.437 --> 01:18:09.948

her, get her out of here.

01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:11.177
