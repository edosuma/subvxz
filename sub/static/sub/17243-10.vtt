WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:03.261
This was a good choice.

00:03.295 --> 00:05.129
Yep.

00:05.164 --> 00:07.131
We make good choices.

00:07.166 --> 00:11.370
Mm-hmm, this was a really healthy choice.

00:11.404 --> 00:13.136
Well, I'm gonna go to work now.

00:13.171 --> 00:15.773
Okay.

00:15.807 --> 00:18.175
Which is where I should've
been fifteen minutes ago.

00:18.209 --> 00:20.878
Mm-hmm.

00:20.912 --> 00:22.713
Stevie?

00:22.748 --> 00:24.181
Oh, Stevie!

00:26.651 --> 00:28.218
What?

00:28.253 --> 00:32.155
It's your dad, he saw me! (Bleep)!

00:32.189 --> 00:35.158
It's the towels again, we need towels!

00:35.193 --> 00:38.661
Your dad can't know about this!

00:38.696 --> 00:41.698
It's humiliating for me!

00:41.732 --> 00:43.000
Stevie, is this where you keep the towels?

00:43.034 --> 00:44.634
If it is, I'd love a key!

00:44.668 --> 00:46.703
Okay!

00:46.737 --> 00:48.605
Here you go.

00:48.639 --> 00:51.574
Okay, this is a face cloth, and a bath mat.

00:51.609 --> 00:54.644
Oh! Uh...

00:54.678 --> 00:56.780
I will get you some towels and
I will bring them to your room.

00:56.814 --> 00:59.215
Oh, I'd love to take them
with me, I need them now.

00:59.249 --> 01:00.816
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

01:00.850 --> 01:02.818
I will deliver them to your room.

01:02.852 --> 01:04.319
Stevie!

01:04.354 --> 01:06.923
Is everything okay?

01:06.957 --> 01:09.758
Yes, I'm just a little tied up right now.

01:09.793 --> 01:12.228
- Is anyone in there?
- What? No!

01:12.262 --> 01:14.563
Are you in danger?
Blink if you're in danger.

01:14.597 --> 01:16.198
Stevie!

01:16.233 --> 01:19.068
That's really not necessary.

01:19.102 --> 01:22.437
Okay well, I'm going back to my room now...

01:22.471 --> 01:23.671
And I'm gonna call the police!

01:23.705 --> 01:25.807
No, Mr. Rose, please don't call the police!

01:25.841 --> 01:29.077
Dad, please just take
the towels, and go!

01:32.514 --> 01:35.516
Oh...

01:35.551 --> 01:39.887
Well, I uh, I've got everything I need...

01:39.922 --> 01:42.023
Good seeing you both.

01:46.161 --> 01:51.131
- Synced and corrected by ChrisKe -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:51.166 --> 01:55.200
- Um, what happened with
- Stop!

01:55.672 --> 01:58.138
- What um... Okay, what happened-
- You said something about-

01:58.173 --> 02:00.708
You slept with Stevie!

02:00.742 --> 02:02.610
What, did dad tell the whole motel?!

02:02.644 --> 02:04.912
Well no, but I heard through the wall,

02:04.947 --> 02:08.048
'cause he was doing his high pitched voice.

02:08.083 --> 02:10.651
So, was it cute for you, or what?

02:10.686 --> 02:13.587
It was fine, it was weird,
it was weird, it was good.

02:13.621 --> 02:14.888
- Love that.
- It was good but weird.

02:14.922 --> 02:16.223
I love that!

02:16.257 --> 02:19.660
Um, okay, so I have to tell you this,

02:19.695 --> 02:23.130
um, Ted wants to meet my friends,

02:23.164 --> 02:25.599
So I think it's getting kinda serious.

02:25.633 --> 02:28.368
- It's been two weeks.
- I know.

02:28.402 --> 02:31.037
What's your point, David?!

02:31.071 --> 02:33.439
Ugh! So anyway,

02:33.474 --> 02:35.809
We're throwing a party
at his place tonight,

02:35.843 --> 02:38.277
so I would say be there around like, seven.

02:38.312 --> 02:40.409
That's presumptuous, what if I have plans?

02:40.447 --> 02:42.148
That's so cute, bring Stevie!

02:42.183 --> 02:43.416
No, I'm not bringing
Stevie, it's not a good time,

02:43.450 --> 02:46.986
- I'm gonna let the dust settle on that...
- Well okay, but Ted's already getting groceries,

02:47.020 --> 02:50.890
and I may... I already invited her.

02:50.924 --> 02:52.257
So it's gonna be fun!

02:52.291 --> 02:53.191
David, it's gonna be so much fun!

02:53.226 --> 02:55.895
Children, children!

02:55.929 --> 02:58.330
Your father and I have
something to discuss.

02:58.364 --> 02:59.665
I'm really busy right now, though.

02:59.699 --> 03:01.000
I can't right now, I don't have time.

03:01.034 --> 03:04.469
We understand you have
found some local friends

03:04.504 --> 03:07.906
- with whom to spend "time" with
- Oh my God!

03:07.940 --> 03:08.540
Okay, I can't deal with this right now-

03:08.574 --> 03:10.742
And that's fine.

03:10.776 --> 03:15.213
But we do have to be careful
with our hearts and our parts.

03:15.248 --> 03:18.850
Because a podunk baby out of wedlock

03:18.884 --> 03:21.019
is not something your
father and I can afford

03:21.054 --> 03:23.288
to negotiate at this moment.

03:23.322 --> 03:24.855
Well, that's crazy,

03:24.889 --> 03:27.358
because all I want to negotiate right now

03:27.392 --> 03:30.061
is some podunk baby out of wedlock! So-

03:30.095 --> 03:32.629
Okay, hi. Hi!

03:32.664 --> 03:35.499
I don't wanna sound
negative about this at all,

03:35.534 --> 03:38.635
but I think that you two
really actually need to consider

03:38.670 --> 03:43.040
the idea of um... Getting a life.

03:43.075 --> 03:45.542
Alexis, I would not concern
yourself with your mother and me,

03:45.577 --> 03:48.979
because we have a
flourishing social life here.

03:49.013 --> 03:51.347
Walking over to the
cafe and ordering a tuna melt

03:51.382 --> 03:53.617
is hardly what I would call
a flourishing social life.

03:53.651 --> 03:56.486
Oh, that's funny. That's funny.

03:56.520 --> 03:58.521
Yeah, it's just that you're so involved

03:58.556 --> 04:00.423
in our lives right now,

04:00.458 --> 04:03.159
and that was fine when we were
child actors for a little bit,

04:03.194 --> 04:05.361
but now David and I are grown up adults,

04:05.396 --> 04:08.098
and we're just feeling very like, um...

04:08.132 --> 04:08.864
- Suffocated.
- Suffocated.

04:08.899 --> 04:12.678
- Suffocated?!
- Wait, stop, stop!

04:12.703 --> 04:15.938
We came in here to speak about you two!

04:15.973 --> 04:18.774
What could you possibly have to say now?

04:20.978 --> 04:22.378
Well, now I don't remember.

04:22.413 --> 04:23.746
Yeah, I don't remember.

04:23.780 --> 04:26.456
Oh my God! Thanks.

04:30.186 --> 04:32.187
You know, the more I think about it,

04:32.222 --> 04:34.789
the more I wonder whether David's whole...

04:34.824 --> 04:37.459
"Sexually adventurous"
thing was just a phase.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.161
It's not a phase.

04:39.195 --> 04:42.297
Well, you know, he was
very influenced in college,

04:42.332 --> 04:44.933
- all those haircuts.
- It's not a phase, John!

04:44.967 --> 04:46.935
The kids are right,

04:46.969 --> 04:50.038
we've been talking about them
far more than I care to do.

04:50.072 --> 04:51.906
Something about that top
that just knocks me out, baby!

04:51.941 --> 04:53.241
Hey, how you doing?

04:53.275 --> 04:55.376
Ah, okay...

04:55.410 --> 04:57.879
- Jocelyn, hi!
- Hi, Moira.

04:57.913 --> 04:59.014
Why don't you join us?

04:59.048 --> 05:00.615
Moira, what're you doing?

05:00.650 --> 05:03.216
Attempting to be social, support me.

05:03.251 --> 05:05.352
- Won't you, please?
- Hey, sure! Hi!

05:05.386 --> 05:06.887
Of course.

05:06.921 --> 05:09.156
- Hello!
- Well!

05:09.190 --> 05:10.390
- Hello.
- Hello.

05:10.424 --> 05:11.458
Good to see you!

05:11.492 --> 05:13.961
Look at us, all being together!

05:13.995 --> 05:17.698
- Yes...
- Jonathan and I were just saying,

05:17.732 --> 05:19.867
wouldn't it be fun to have
the mayor and his wife

05:19.901 --> 05:23.069
over for cocktails and charades tonight!

05:23.103 --> 05:25.772
Yes... Tonight.

05:25.806 --> 05:28.708
Oh, yeah, no, unfortunately
that's not gonna work for us.

05:28.742 --> 05:31.010
We're having a huge party
tonight at our place.

05:31.057 --> 05:33.278
Ton of people coming to our house. Whoo!

05:33.312 --> 05:34.881
Oh yeah, big!

05:34.915 --> 05:37.315
But we're free any other
night, other than tonight.

05:39.000 --> 05:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:51.297 --> 05:54.864
- Hey.
- So, um...

05:55.601 --> 05:59.671
So the other... so, last night um...

05:59.706 --> 06:01.472
- That was just a...
- Was a one time thing.

06:01.507 --> 06:02.974
- That was a one time
- Like a blip.

06:03.009 --> 06:06.977
Just a blip... Just a blip blop. Just a...

06:08.847 --> 06:12.049
My sister said that she uh...

06:12.084 --> 06:13.484
- Invited me to Ted's, yeah.
- Yes, she'd asked you to Ted's.

06:13.519 --> 06:16.454
- Yeah.
- Yep, um...

06:16.488 --> 06:17.928
Okay, well I'm gonna leave from here,

06:17.956 --> 06:19.357
should I just come by your place,

06:19.391 --> 06:21.025
and get you when I'm done?

06:21.059 --> 06:22.793
Yeah, we can go together, 'cause that's...

06:22.828 --> 06:25.230
That's like, a totally
normal thing for us to do.

06:25.264 --> 06:27.464
- Why would it not be?
- No, it's not! I mean...

06:27.498 --> 06:30.367
So um...

06:30.401 --> 06:32.161
- So, cool!
- Yeah, no, this is a good thing.

06:32.169 --> 06:34.471
So I'll just um...

06:34.505 --> 06:35.985
I'll see you when you swing by, so...

06:36.006 --> 06:37.874
Yeah, I'll be-

06:37.908 --> 06:40.392
okay, all right, blippity
blop. Blippity blip.

06:43.881 --> 06:46.116
You're quiet today.

06:46.150 --> 06:48.584
Am I?

06:48.619 --> 06:50.386
It's just that you're not talking,

06:50.420 --> 06:53.188
and it's annoying, because I'm bored.

06:53.223 --> 06:54.557
Can't we just think and work,

06:54.591 --> 06:56.825
or do we always have to talk?

06:56.860 --> 06:58.294
Okay, you're being super
sketchy and emo right now,

06:58.328 --> 06:59.995
what is going on?

07:00.029 --> 07:01.764
Have you ever been in a relationship

07:01.798 --> 07:03.165
- where you find yourself cheating
- Yes!

07:03.199 --> 07:05.033
With someone in your dreams?

07:05.068 --> 07:07.769
Oh, what?

07:07.803 --> 07:11.005
Oh. Um... you know that
if it's in your dreams,

07:11.039 --> 07:15.610
or over the clothes,
it's not cheating, right?

07:15.645 --> 07:17.412
Yeah well, it's been
happening a lot lately,

07:17.446 --> 07:20.749
and then I look over and I
see Twyla, and I feel bad.

07:20.783 --> 07:23.351
Also, Ted is throwing a party tonight,

07:23.386 --> 07:28.155
maybe that's something exciting
for you two to do together?

07:28.189 --> 07:30.857
That's probably not such a good idea.

07:33.628 --> 07:35.929
Mmm...

07:35.963 --> 07:38.399
Oh. Oh! Oh.

07:41.984 --> 07:46.372
I'm sorry, what kind of event
are you hosting this evening?

07:46.407 --> 07:48.541
Event!

07:48.575 --> 07:51.644
Oh, it's more of a soiree.

07:51.679 --> 07:55.247
He's just teasing, it's
our annual Hawaiian night.

07:55.282 --> 07:58.250
Pineapples, pig on the
spit, the whole nine yards.

07:58.285 --> 08:00.687
Oh, you roast pigs?

08:00.721 --> 08:01.854
- We do!
- Sure do.

08:01.888 --> 08:03.388
We have a big one hanging in the garage.

08:03.423 --> 08:05.557
Hm-hm.

08:05.591 --> 08:10.261
Wow, it sounds like
um... quite the evening.

08:10.296 --> 08:14.466
So whose pig do we have to
slaughter to get an invite?

08:14.500 --> 08:17.703
Oh my goodness, well, um...

08:17.737 --> 08:21.973
We just didn't think that you
and Johnny would wanna come, so...

08:22.007 --> 08:23.641
Well, that's a touch presumptuous Jocelyn,

08:23.675 --> 08:25.943
why would we not want to be involved

08:25.977 --> 08:28.045
in a themed party in your yard?

08:28.079 --> 08:30.080
Right.

08:30.114 --> 08:32.616
Well, I mean, for one thing,

08:32.650 --> 08:34.985
you know, the two of you are a little...

08:35.019 --> 08:37.755
A little what?

08:37.789 --> 08:40.224
Hoity-toity.

08:40.258 --> 08:42.158
All right, I've said it.

08:42.192 --> 08:45.261
We didn't think that you'd wanna
hang out with "regular people."

08:45.295 --> 08:46.730
What?

08:46.764 --> 08:49.065
Regular people?!

08:49.099 --> 08:52.802
Regular people are how
Rose Video became such a-

08:52.837 --> 08:55.137
Right, c-careful, Moira.

08:55.172 --> 08:57.607
Regular people! I mean,
they made us who we were-

08:57.641 --> 08:59.041
What am I trying to say?

08:59.076 --> 09:00.909
We love regular people.

09:00.943 --> 09:02.611
W-we love regular people.

09:02.645 --> 09:06.281
Well, by all means then,
the two of you are invited.

09:06.315 --> 09:07.948
Thank you!

09:12.652 --> 09:17.492
So, just to be clear,
um, I'm a red wine drinker.

09:17.556 --> 09:19.290
- That's fine.
- Okay, cool.

09:19.325 --> 09:21.759
But uh, I only drink red wine.

09:21.793 --> 09:24.696
Okay.

09:24.730 --> 09:27.832
And up until last night
I was under the impression

09:27.866 --> 09:32.169
that you too only drank red wine.

09:32.216 --> 09:34.338
But I guess I was wrong?

09:34.372 --> 09:36.072
I see where you're going with this.

09:36.107 --> 09:40.505
Um... I do drink red wine.

09:40.578 --> 09:43.980
But I also drink white wine.

09:44.014 --> 09:47.117
- Oh. - And I've been known
to sample the occasional Rose.

09:47.151 --> 09:50.254
And a couple summers back I tried a Merlot,

09:50.288 --> 09:52.788
that used to be a chardonnay.

09:52.822 --> 09:53.822
- Uh-okay.
- Which got a bit complicated.

09:53.857 --> 09:56.091
Yeah, so, you're just
really open to all wines.

09:56.126 --> 09:57.486
I like the wine, and not the label.

09:57.494 --> 09:59.128
Does that make sense?

09:59.162 --> 10:00.963
- Yes, that does.
- Okay.

10:00.997 --> 10:03.733
Um, this is just very new to me,

10:03.767 --> 10:05.635
so as long as you didn't roll over,

10:05.669 --> 10:07.202
and cry yourself to sleep with regret,

10:07.237 --> 10:09.037
then we're good, right?

10:09.072 --> 10:10.773
No, no, no, I absolutely did that.

10:10.807 --> 10:12.940
Just wept for hours in the dark.

10:12.975 --> 10:14.695
I say we go with this
one, it's the biggest.

10:16.779 --> 10:20.448
Wow Ted, the place is very... New looking.

10:20.483 --> 10:22.684
Did you design the interior?

10:22.718 --> 10:25.520
Oh, I wish!

10:25.554 --> 10:27.622
No, I found this website
online that sells off

10:27.657 --> 10:29.724
old department store show rooms.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.759
So this whole room-

10:31.794 --> 10:33.828
Just gets delivered, as is.

10:33.862 --> 10:36.097
This is the "bachelor's den" here,

10:36.131 --> 10:37.531
and then that's the "executive
dining lounge"

10:37.565 --> 10:40.273
that I got on black Friday.

10:41.270 --> 10:42.770
- Wow!
- Yeah.

10:42.805 --> 10:44.305
Wow.

10:47.642 --> 10:51.412
So... Are we the only ones
showing up to this party?

10:51.446 --> 10:53.514
No, we're still waiting for Mutt and Twyla.

10:53.548 --> 10:55.382
Oh, I should take the
rolls out of the microwave.

10:55.417 --> 10:58.018
Hot rolls!

10:58.052 --> 11:01.054
Alexis had just said that this
was a "party" party.

11:01.088 --> 11:02.356
Ah well, you must've been
misinformed then, David.

11:02.390 --> 11:04.057
No, it's a dinner party.

11:04.091 --> 11:05.726
I wanted to get to know Alexis'
friends a bit,

11:05.760 --> 11:07.961
so I figured we'd invite
a few couples over,

11:07.995 --> 11:10.062
huh, have some dinner, play some games?

11:16.670 --> 11:18.204
You guys showed!

11:18.238 --> 11:19.905
Yeah, why wouldn't we show?

11:19.940 --> 11:21.106
Twyla, I love your outfit,

11:21.141 --> 11:24.344
you look like a little Georgia peach!

11:24.378 --> 11:26.145
- Hi.
- So, where is everybody?

11:26.179 --> 11:28.080
I thought this was a party.

11:28.114 --> 11:31.249
It is, it's an exclusive little party.

11:36.789 --> 11:39.424
Hey, who turned off don ho?!

11:39.459 --> 11:41.860
- Oh hey, aloha, Roses!
- Look who it is.

11:41.894 --> 11:43.595
It's the Schitts!

11:43.629 --> 11:45.731
Hey! Yeah, there you go.

11:45.765 --> 11:46.765
- Jocelyn.
- Moira.

11:46.766 --> 11:48.366
Ooh, Johnny!

11:48.400 --> 11:50.701
I gotta tell you, that suit,

11:50.736 --> 11:53.070
that's pretty dangerous to
wear at a party like this!

11:53.104 --> 11:54.572
I just wanna wipe my hands all over that!

11:54.606 --> 11:56.240
Oh!

11:56.274 --> 11:57.708
You just keep getting funnier.

11:57.743 --> 12:00.444
I'm not joking though, I really do.

12:00.479 --> 12:03.414
Moira, I have to ask you,
are those wigs real hair?

12:03.448 --> 12:04.248
I just wanna reach out
and just touch them-

12:04.282 --> 12:05.983
oh, please don't!

12:06.017 --> 12:08.351
No, Maureen does not like to be manhandled!

12:08.386 --> 12:10.086
- Sorry, sorry.
- Hey Roses, if I tell you a secret,

12:10.120 --> 12:11.521
you promise to keep it?

12:11.555 --> 12:13.723
Uh no, I don't think we would, what is it?

12:13.758 --> 12:15.324
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Johnny...

12:19.797 --> 12:21.931
Now listen, I'm the guy in charge

12:21.965 --> 12:23.366
of upholding the law around here,

12:23.401 --> 12:25.801
so if you have any ideas
about turning me in,

12:25.835 --> 12:28.470
you'd just be turning me in to myself!

12:30.673 --> 12:31.807
Spark it up, Roley! Spark it up.

12:31.841 --> 12:33.542
You got it, honey.

12:33.576 --> 12:36.044
Listen, I don't know if you
guys wanna partake in this,

12:36.078 --> 12:37.780
because I'm sure your fancy dinner parties

12:37.814 --> 12:41.082
didn't have illegal substances!

12:41.117 --> 12:42.818
Illegal substances.

12:42.852 --> 12:45.286
Amateurs.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.288
We had friends in the fda, but...

12:47.322 --> 12:48.823
When in Rome.

12:48.857 --> 12:51.025
Well damn, Roses!

12:51.059 --> 12:52.827
Let this party begin.

12:52.861 --> 12:55.229
I'll fire up the cheese fountain!

13:06.441 --> 13:09.743
Oh!

13:09.777 --> 13:12.679
No thank you.

13:12.713 --> 13:16.450
So Mutt, did you two criminals

13:16.484 --> 13:18.652
do any good for the community today?

13:18.686 --> 13:20.787
You washed a car, wow.

13:20.822 --> 13:22.855
The judicial system is really cracking down

13:22.889 --> 13:24.757
on its delinquents these days, huh?

13:24.791 --> 13:26.258
You know what I always wondered,

13:26.292 --> 13:28.928
what do you two talk
about all day out there?

13:30.464 --> 13:33.065
Nothing.

13:33.099 --> 13:35.668
I mean we talk, but...

13:35.702 --> 13:37.035
We don't really talk
about anything important.

13:37.070 --> 13:39.071
So... Like what?

13:41.107 --> 13:43.476
Like, nothing!

13:43.510 --> 13:45.477
Okay, um...

13:45.511 --> 13:47.579
Like, Mutt was having a bad day today,

13:47.613 --> 13:50.414
so we talked about that.

13:50.449 --> 13:52.951
You didn't tell me you
were having a bad day.

13:55.120 --> 13:57.388
- Ted, this is delicious.
- Mm-hmm.

13:57.422 --> 13:59.491
I didn't mean a bad day, Twy,

13:59.525 --> 14:01.726
I just meant like, he
was questioning things.

14:01.760 --> 14:04.028
Thank you, Stevie, I ordered
it online from Nevada.

14:04.062 --> 14:05.930
No sales tax.

14:05.965 --> 14:08.099
- What were you questioning?
- It's nothing.

14:08.133 --> 14:10.501
So when the lasagna gets delivered,

14:10.535 --> 14:13.104
does it come frozen, or... ?

14:13.138 --> 14:15.439
Okay, I just uh...

14:15.474 --> 14:16.507
I don't know why you
didn't feel comfortable

14:16.541 --> 14:17.941
talking to me about it.

14:17.976 --> 14:20.144
It's not important.

14:20.178 --> 14:22.313
That's why I was talking
to Alexis about it.

14:22.347 --> 14:26.016
Stevie, how long have
you and David been um...

14:26.050 --> 14:27.850
It's very fresh, and new.

14:27.885 --> 14:28.451
- No, it's not.
- It is, I would say.

14:28.486 --> 14:30.686
Uh uh!

14:30.721 --> 14:33.823
So everyone knows?

14:33.857 --> 14:37.293
- Knows what?
- These two have...

14:37.328 --> 14:40.163
What an elegant gesture, Ted.

14:40.197 --> 14:43.033
I-I'm sorry, I thought everyone knew.

14:43.067 --> 14:46.235
- No.
- It's okay.

14:46.269 --> 14:48.137
Sorry!

14:55.311 --> 14:57.079
I've been with these people before.

14:57.113 --> 14:59.815
I know them all.

14:59.850 --> 15:03.318
Wow, you've really been
getting around town.

15:03.353 --> 15:07.456
No, I was with them in my other life.

15:07.490 --> 15:09.858
I'm gonna tell you something.

15:09.892 --> 15:13.395
I'm from a small town, just like this.

15:13.430 --> 15:16.298
No, I'm not buying that!

15:16.332 --> 15:19.101
- It's true.
- Really?

15:19.135 --> 15:21.170
Why would you leave?

15:21.204 --> 15:23.805
Oh God, I couldn't wait to get out.

15:23.839 --> 15:26.174
I was dying there.

15:26.208 --> 15:28.209
Have you never dreamed?

15:28.243 --> 15:31.345
Of a life beyond?

15:31.380 --> 15:34.882
You have what ifs, like, what if...

15:34.916 --> 15:37.118
I had enlisted in the military,

15:37.152 --> 15:39.153
what if Roland hadn't been
such a smooth talker, what-

15:39.188 --> 15:41.689
oh man, what if!

15:41.723 --> 15:46.561
What if I had not been
crowned "miss snow cone" at 16,

15:46.595 --> 15:48.896
and moved to the city
with my driving instructor?

15:48.930 --> 15:50.664
Awesome.

15:50.699 --> 15:53.000
And what if I had not hand modeled

15:53.034 --> 15:55.435
at that microwave trade show?

15:55.470 --> 15:56.470
Yeah.

15:56.471 --> 15:58.371
What if I didn't ask,

15:58.406 --> 16:01.942
who's the eyebrows buying
everyone's drinks?

16:01.977 --> 16:04.778
Wow, now you know.

16:04.813 --> 16:07.314
Whatever happened to privacy?

16:07.348 --> 16:09.849
Now your whole family
thinks I'm this big hooker!

16:09.883 --> 16:13.152
My whole family does not
think you're a big hooker!

16:13.186 --> 16:15.454
It a funny one night thing!

16:15.489 --> 16:16.823
Everyone here is fine with it.

16:16.857 --> 16:19.659
It was funny?

16:19.693 --> 16:21.494
Yeah, it was a
f-it was a fun-

16:21.528 --> 16:24.597
it was a-it was a
funny-it was-yes.

16:24.632 --> 16:26.065
I had a best friend that hooked.

16:26.100 --> 16:27.299
She married one of her
Johns on my birthday.

16:27.334 --> 16:28.735
Wow, so cool!

16:28.769 --> 16:30.802
It's not the time, Twyla.

16:30.837 --> 16:33.139
Um Stevie, I don't
think you're a big hooker.

16:33.173 --> 16:34.773
You don't talk all dinner,

16:34.807 --> 16:37.009
and now you're telling me
I can't talk about Trixie?!

16:37.043 --> 16:38.944
I'm sorry, it's just I think
sometimes you have a tendency

16:38.978 --> 16:41.147
to say the wrong thing, that's all.

16:41.181 --> 16:44.316
Is there a right time to
talk about being a hooker?

16:44.351 --> 16:46.418
I bet nobody thought
sex with Trixie was funny.

16:46.453 --> 16:48.320
I never said it was bad!

16:48.355 --> 16:51.422
Okay, you know what I think is happening,

16:51.457 --> 16:53.191
is things are just getting
blown out of proportion,

16:53.225 --> 16:56.727
and honestly, if Alexis,

16:56.762 --> 16:57.862
you just tell us what you
and mutt were talking about,

16:57.896 --> 16:59.697
it'd probably help.

16:59.731 --> 17:02.700
Oh my God, Ted!

17:02.734 --> 17:04.502
We were just washing a car,
and talking about bad dreams.

17:04.537 --> 17:06.904
- Okay?
- Okay.

17:06.938 --> 17:08.739
You sound a little defensive.

17:08.773 --> 17:10.407
- I'd agree.
- Well...

17:10.442 --> 17:11.509
You know what, i just remembered,

17:11.544 --> 17:12.742
I have to wake up early tomorrow,

17:12.778 --> 17:14.377
I have an early check in.

17:14.412 --> 17:17.079
Uh, nobody checks in.

17:17.114 --> 17:19.816
Tomorrow someone is, early.

17:19.849 --> 17:23.387
Uh Ted, you have a really special place,

17:23.421 --> 17:26.623
and we should all do this again some time.

17:26.657 --> 17:28.392
David, would you mind walking me home,

17:28.425 --> 17:29.926
I don't think we're finished talking.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.428
Oooh, David!

17:31.462 --> 17:33.463
Don't!

17:36.400 --> 17:40.135
My son lives in a barn
in the woods, by choice!

17:42.706 --> 17:46.842
He could be the next mayor
of this town if he wanted it.

17:46.876 --> 17:48.611
My son is "pansexual."

17:51.315 --> 17:53.849
Mm-hmm, I've heard of that.

17:53.883 --> 17:56.551
I know what that is, that's uh...

17:56.586 --> 17:58.486
That cookware fetish.

17:58.521 --> 17:59.822
- No.
- Mm-hmm!

17:59.856 --> 18:01.656
- No, no.
- No, I read about that!

18:01.657 --> 18:04.927
No, he loves everyone, men, women,

18:04.961 --> 18:09.297
women who become men, men who become women.

18:09.332 --> 18:13.335
I'm his father, and I always
wanted his life to be easy.

18:13.369 --> 18:17.772
But you know, just pick
one gender, and maybe,

18:17.806 --> 18:20.308
maybe everything would've
been less... confusing.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.480
Well... You know Johnny,

18:25.514 --> 18:28.717
when it comes to matters of the heart,

18:28.751 --> 18:30.885
we can't tell our kids who to love.

18:33.188 --> 18:34.708
- Who said that?
- You did.

18:34.724 --> 18:37.125
When?

18:37.159 --> 18:39.693
- You just said it now!
- When?

18:39.728 --> 18:41.695
Now, right this second, you just said it.

18:41.730 --> 18:43.250
And you're right, you can't tell them.

18:43.265 --> 18:44.899
And I'm fine with that.

18:47.136 --> 18:51.272
Whoa, thank you for playing along.

18:51.306 --> 18:52.946
I'm sorry, I just had to get out of there,

18:52.975 --> 18:54.942
it was like being in an
episode of "couples therapy."

18:54.977 --> 18:57.544
Okay wait, this was all a put on,

18:57.579 --> 18:59.780
just to get out of dinner?

18:59.814 --> 19:03.517
Yeah, I thought you were in on it.

19:03.551 --> 19:06.687
Well, you deserve a daytime
Emmy for that performance.

19:06.721 --> 19:09.356
Thank you, I think so.

19:09.391 --> 19:12.993
Okay, so you're not like,
raging mad at me, then.

19:13.027 --> 19:15.362
No. I think it's fair
to say that neither of us

19:15.397 --> 19:18.031
have ever worked with
a ceiling mirror before.

19:18.065 --> 19:20.167
- True.
- It was funny!

19:20.201 --> 19:22.235
And a little humiliating.

19:22.270 --> 19:24.971
Yeah, I uh...

19:25.006 --> 19:27.808
Saw a lot of my body, and I didn't like it.

19:27.842 --> 19:28.922
- Mm-hmm.
- So...

19:28.943 --> 19:31.544
I'm actually that way.

19:31.578 --> 19:33.880
Okay, yeah, I was um-

19:33.915 --> 19:36.649
wondering if maybe we should um...

19:36.684 --> 19:38.483
Try it again, for the sake of practice?

19:38.518 --> 19:40.752
I'd be into that idea...

19:40.787 --> 19:42.922
For the sake of proficiency.

19:48.661 --> 19:51.229
So I guess we won't be playing headbandz.

19:56.318 --> 19:58.753
- Why did you say that?
- Oh my God.

19:58.787 --> 20:00.187
What the hell

20:00.221 --> 20:01.922
Just don't
- just stay here.

20:01.957 --> 20:04.525
Oh, hello again!

20:04.559 --> 20:05.459
Spending another night together?

20:05.494 --> 20:07.194
Dad!

20:07.228 --> 20:10.498
Oh, Stevie, I hope you're being smart.

20:10.532 --> 20:11.966
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God!

20:12.000 --> 20:14.534
Because we can't afford a baby right now,

20:14.568 --> 20:17.737
and, let's be honest, neither can you!

20:17.771 --> 20:20.239
Okay, well, I think it's about
time that you two go to bed.

20:20.273 --> 20:22.575
Excuse me!

20:22.610 --> 20:25.277
David, I just want you
to know that I support this.

20:25.312 --> 20:28.848
Not the fact that you're sleeping
with a girl, which is great.

20:28.883 --> 20:30.884
But you know, I'd be just as happy

20:30.918 --> 20:33.485
if you were to bring home
one of your guy friends.

20:33.520 --> 20:35.821
What are you talking about?!

20:35.855 --> 20:37.756
Excuse me while I just go draw a warm bath,

20:37.790 --> 20:39.290
and plug in my hair dryer.

20:39.325 --> 20:42.027
No, no, Stevie!

20:42.061 --> 20:44.663
You're a lovely girl, lovely girl.

20:44.697 --> 20:47.766
Bit of an edge, but you
know, it's growing on me.

20:47.800 --> 20:51.036
David, I just want you
to know that I endorse

20:51.070 --> 20:53.938
all your sexual encounters.

20:53.972 --> 20:55.240
A-are you drunk?!

20:55.274 --> 20:57.409
Grass, too much grass.

20:57.443 --> 20:59.944
- A little bit, but.
- What the... ?

20:59.978 --> 21:02.914
Hey, track that cycle, missy!

21:02.948 --> 21:04.949
Okay, good night!

21:04.983 --> 21:06.784
Hey, good night!

21:06.818 --> 21:07.718
Good night.

21:07.720 --> 21:14.425
Hey!

21:14.427 --> 21:15.525
Come in and say hi

21:15.527 --> 21:16.693
to your aunt Dee Dee.

21:16.695 --> 21:17.727
Better hurry before she

21:17.729 --> 21:19.395
disappears for another decade.

21:19.397 --> 21:20.931
We should probably establish

21:20.933 --> 21:21.932
some boundaries about this whole

21:21.934 --> 21:23.033
friends with benefits thing.

21:23.035 --> 21:24.267
Can we do that after

21:24.269 --> 21:26.636
you screw Mr. fix-it? Or...

21:26.638 --> 21:27.638
Hey!
