07:03.990 --> 07:06.618
I DON'T KNOW. GUESS WE'LL JUST
LIE LOW FOR A BIT.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.549

ON THEIR OPERATION,

07:11.860 --> 07:13.589
THINGS WILL DEFINITELY
MOVE FASTER.

07:13.630 --> 07:15.791
WELL, THAT'S GOOD. SIX MONTHS
HANGING OUT WITH THESE IDIOTS...

07:15.830 --> 07:19.163

07:34.280 --> 07:35.941
YOU WANNA COME

07:35.980 --> 07:38.915
NO. IT'S HOT. IT'S SUMMER.
THE CITY'S IN GRIDLOCK.

07:38.950 --> 07:41.089

15S ARE DOWN.
IT LOOKS BAD FOR US.

07:48.630 --> 07:49.767
SO I'M BETTING SPEED TRAPS.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.062
EASIEST WAY
TO BOOST THOSE NUMBERS

07:51.100 --> 07:52.590
AND MEET OUR QUOTA.

07:52.640 --> 07:53.868
QUOTA?
(gun clicks)

07:53.900 --> 07:55.629
WE DON'T HAVE A QUOTA.

07:55.670 --> 07:57.831
NO, OF COURSE WE DON'T.

07:57.870 --> 07:58.859
20 BUCKS, HUH?

07:58.910 --> 08:00.969
YEP.

08:01.010 --> 08:01.977
I'LL TAKE YOUR MONEY.

08:02.010 --> 08:03.568
RIGHT THIS WAY,
DETECTIVE.

08:03.610 --> 08:05.498
IS THAT FOR ME?

08:05.550 --> 08:07.643
THOUGHT WE'D OPEN UP
WITH A JOKE TODAY.
OH, I'VE GOT A GOOD ONE.

08:07.680 --> 08:08.749
I HAVE AN EXTRA ONE.
TWO GUYS--
A NINJA--

08:08.780 --> 08:10.589
MY JOKE.
OH.

08:10.620 --> 08:11.746
OKAY.

08:14.590 --> 08:16.524
I CAN'T REMEMBER THE JOKE.

08:16.560 --> 08:17.788
(laughter)
BUT IT WAS A GOOD ONE.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.525
IT WAS ABOUT TRAFFIC.

08:19.560 --> 08:22.256
WE HAVE 12 MAJOR INTERSECT IONS
BLOCKED OFF TODAY.

08:22.300 --> 08:25.565
OKAY? AVENUE AND YONGE--
THEY'RE BOTH DOWN TO ONE LANE.

08:25.600 --> 08:29.058
IT'S A NIGHTMARE, WHICH MEANS
EVERYTHING IS SLOWED DOWN,

08:29.100 --> 08:31.739
INCLUDING OUR NUMBERS, SO...

08:31.770 --> 08:32.702
I WANT SPEED TRAPS...

08:32.740 --> 08:35.300
(officers groan)
AT ALL THE USUAL LOCATIONS.

08:35.340 --> 08:36.978
FISH IN A BARREL, RIGHT?

08:37.010 --> 08:38.204
YOU ALL KNOW THE DRILL.

08:38.250 --> 08:39.945
ASSIGNMENTS ARE ON THE BOARD.

08:39.980 --> 08:42.983
(indistinct conversations)

08:45.090 --> 08:46.614
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.111
DOV, YOU GOTTA
WEAR THE VEST.

08:49.160 --> 08:52.550
DO I?

08:52.600 --> 08:54.750
SPEEDERS, SPEEDING.
THEY GOTTA BE ABLE TO SEE YOU.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.620
YEAH. I DON'T DO THE VEST.

08:56.670 --> 08:57.898
'CAUSE IT DOESN'T
LOOK COOL?

08:57.930 --> 08:59.761
YOU'RE CELIBATE.
WHAT DO YOU CARE?

08:59.800 --> 09:02.633
(chuckles) I KNOW,
AND I'VE NEVER FELT BETTER.

09:02.670 --> 09:03.568
I'M TELLING YOU,
IT'S AMAZING.

09:03.610 --> 09:05.032
LOOK AT MY EYES.

09:05.070 --> 09:07.573
LOOK AT THE WHITES.
CRYSTAL CLEAR.

09:07.610 --> 09:09.578
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD TRY IT.

09:09.610 --> 09:11.305
WELL, DOV, I'M JUST BACK
INTO MY MARRIAGE.

09:11.350 --> 09:13.841
I DON'T THINK THAT
CELIBACY'S IN THE CARDS,

09:13.880 --> 09:15.575
EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT,
OF COURSE,

09:15.620 --> 09:17.247
I AM JUST BACK
INTO MY MARRIAGE.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.315
YEAH? HOW'S THAT GOING?

09:19.350 --> 09:23.980
IT'S GOING. HUH? HAPPY TO BE
BACK WITH THE GIRLS.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.986
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT...

09:26.030 --> 09:29.022
IT'S HARD. I'M TRYING.

09:29.060 --> 09:34.032
TRYING TO WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW. CHANGE.
BE A BETTER MAN, BETTER...

09:34.070 --> 09:35.059
BETTER HUSBAND.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.204
(tires screech)
OH.

09:39.170 --> 09:40.239
(horn honking)

09:40.280 --> 09:42.601
FRANK WAS RIGHT.
(camera shutter clicks
and beeps)

09:42.650 --> 09:44.675
FISH IN A BARREL.

09:44.710 --> 09:48.612
(motor rewing, tires screech)

09:48.650 --> 09:50.811
(police radio chatter)
SIR, YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW FAST YOU WERE GOING?

09:53.090 --> 09:54.250
NO, OFFICER, I DON'T.

09:54.290 --> 09:55.314
WELL, YOU WANNA TAKE
A GUESS?

09:55.360 --> 09:57.624
20 OVER? 30?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

09:57.660 --> 09:59.890
CAN YOU JUST WRITE ME
THE TICKET?

09:59.930 --> 10:01.659
I NEED TO BE SOMEWHERE.

10:01.700 --> 10:03.395
ACTUALLY,
YOU WERE GOING 50 OVER.

10:03.430 --> 10:05.364
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS?
THAT MEANS THAT YOU WOULD'VE
LIQUEFIED OFFICER EPSTEIN HERE

10:05.400 --> 10:06.321
HAD YOU NOT SEEN HIM.

10:06.370 --> 10:07.268
COME ON, GUYS.
CAN YOU GIVE ME A BREAK HERE?

10:07.300 --> 10:08.858
OFFICER, IT MEANS
WE HAVE TO CHARGE YOU

10:08.900 --> 10:09.867
WITH RECKLESS DRIVING.

10:09.910 --> 10:13.698
LOOK, WHATEVER THE FINE IS,

10:13.740 --> 10:15.731
I GOT A WHOLE BUNCH OF CASH
IN MY POCKET.

10:15.780 --> 10:17.748
DON'T NEED A RECEIPT FOR IT.
YOU KNOW.

10:17.780 --> 10:18.747
WELL, FINE'S $2,000.

10:18.780 --> 10:20.338
SORRY. WHAT?

10:20.380 --> 10:23.713
OFFICER SHAW,
DO WE TAKE CASH?
(laughs)

10:23.750 --> 10:25.115
WE DON'T TAKE CASH...
OR BRIBES.

10:25.150 --> 10:27.380
ALSO MEANS A COURT APPEARANCE,

10:27.420 --> 10:29.684
AND YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE
YOUR LICENSE FOR SEVEN DAYS.
A BRIBE?

10:29.730 --> 10:31.652
AND WE HAVE TO IMPOUND
YOUR VEHICLE.
YOU'RE NOT TAKING MY CAR.

10:31.690 --> 10:32.622
COME ON. (laughs)

10:32.660 --> 10:34.252
OVER MY DEAD BODY,
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE MY CAR.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.188
WELL, NOW YOU'RE JUST
BEING DRAMATIC.

10:36.230 --> 10:38.721
ALL RIGHT, SO LAST NIGHT,

10:38.770 --> 10:40.067
I WAS GONNA WRITE,
"PISTOL-WHIPPED,"

10:40.100 --> 10:41.658
BUT IT WASN'T A PISTOL.
YOU KNOW, IT WAS A SHOTGUN,

10:41.700 --> 10:43.759
BUT "SHOTGUN-WHIPPED"
ISN'T A TERM.

10:43.810 --> 10:44.868
DON'T WRITE THAT.

10:44.910 --> 10:45.865
WHY NOT?

10:45.910 --> 10:46.934
MAKES ME LOOK STUPID.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.936
IT MAKES YOU LOOK HEROIC.

10:48.980 --> 10:50.379
I SHUDDER TO THINK

10:50.410 --> 10:52.105
WHAT YOU WRITE
IN YOUR LITTLE DIARY.

10:52.150 --> 10:54.209
(laughs) "SHUDDER," HUH?

10:54.250 --> 10:56.445
AND THIS IS NOT MY DIARY.
IT'S MY NOTEBOOK.

10:56.480 --> 10:58.345
AND SO WHAT? I'M OLD SCHOOL.

10:58.390 --> 11:01.279
CAN'T TRUST COMPUTERS.
YOU CAN'T WIPE 'EM CLEAN.
YOU SOUND LIKE SWAREK.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.379
WELL, HE DID TRAIN ME.
(gun clicking)

11:03.430 --> 11:05.421
YOU'RE ALLOWED TO START
DOING THINGS Y(O|'UIIE)OWN WAY NOW.
C IC

11:05.460 --> 11:08.349
OH, I AM? WELL, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR YOUR PERMISSION.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.823
IT'S BEEN SEVEN MONTHS.
THE GUY DUMPED YOU ON YOUR ASS,

11:10.870 --> 11:12.792
THEN HE COMES CRAWLING BACK--
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW. OKAY?

11:12.840 --> 11:14.796
TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE.
IT'S OVER.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.296
I MEAN, I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER
THE GUY'S PHONE NUMBER.

11:16.340 --> 11:17.329
(knock on door)

11:17.370 --> 11:19.838
WHO IS IT?
IT'S VON. OPEN UP.

11:25.410 --> 11:27.014

11:27.050 --> 11:29.075
WHAT'S GOING ON?
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

11:29.120 --> 11:30.382
HEY.

IT'S HERE.

11:33.790 --> 11:35.348
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

11:35.390 --> 11:37.028
NEW RULES, BUDDY.

11:37.060 --> 11:38.857
I HOLD ON TO THESE
UNTIL THE JOB IS DONE.

11:38.890 --> 11:41.154
YOU GUYS DON'T TRUST ME?
NOT MY RULES.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.168
JOB? WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:43.200 --> 11:46.169
COME HERE.

11:48.800 --> 11:50.939
SO WE GOT ANOTHER BOAT
COMING IN.

11:50.970 --> 11:52.437
WE'RE GONNA MEET UP WITH IT,
LOAD UP A TRUCK.

11:52.470 --> 11:54.301
I'M GONNA LAY LOW FOR A BIT,

11:54.340 --> 11:56.843
SCREW 'EM. WE'RE BACK

11:56.880 --> 11:59.303

12:04.350 --> 12:06.955

12:13.930 --> 12:16.353

12:16.400 --> 12:18.197
(beep)
HEY. WHAT'S UP?

12:18.230 --> 12:19.492
HEY, SOMETHING'S GOING ON.
WHERE ARE YOU?

12:19.530 --> 12:20.394
I'M BACK IN TOWN.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

12:20.440 --> 12:22.863
Well, Nick just left

12:22.910 --> 12:24.866
THEY TOOK HIS CELL PHONE.
NEW RULES, APPARENTLY.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.502
WHERE ARE THEY GOING?
I-I don't know.
They just came and grabbed Nick.

12:26.540 --> 12:28.405
THEY SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT A SHIPMENT.

12:28.440 --> 12:29.771
UH, THE TRUCK IS
LEAVING TODAY.

12:29.810 --> 12:32.108
REALLY? ALREADY?
YOU, UH, YOU GOT DETAILS?

12:32.150 --> 12:34.072
NO. I MEAN, THAT--THAT'S IT.
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

12:34.120 --> 12:36.315
Well, then why didn't you go?
BECAUSE I COULDN'T.

12:36.350 --> 12:37.317
I MEAN,
THEY'RE SHUTTING ME OUT.

12:37.350 --> 12:38.419
ALL RIGHT, OKAY, YOU NEED
TO GET OVER THERE,

12:38.450 --> 12:39.917
SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND OUT.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.313
AND SAY WHAT?

12:41.360 --> 12:42.315
I don't know, McNally.
You're his girlfriend.

12:42.360 --> 12:43.884
You're, uh, you're worried.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.079

YOU'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.

12:45.130 --> 12:46.927
LOOK, JUST FIND OUT WHAT
YOU CAN. YOU GET TO BACK TO ME.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.097

OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
I'LL TALK TO YOU IN A BIT.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.822

13:06.150 --> 13:08.141
YOU CAN PAY FOR IT PERSON
OR ONLINE,

13:08.180 --> 13:10.216

AND HOPE I DON'T SHOW UP,

13:10.250 --> 13:12.013
BUT I ACTUALLY
KINDA LIKE COURT.

13:12.050 --> 13:13.051
OKAY.

13:15.360 --> 13:18.352
(police radio chatter)

13:19.560 --> 13:21.425
YOU KNOW WHAT I HATE
ABOUT TH ESE VESTS?

13:21.460 --> 13:23.599
A FOURTH LAYER
OF MAN-MADE FIBERS?

13:23.630 --> 13:25.120
NO, I CAN HANDLE THE HEAT.
(sniffs)

13:25.170 --> 13:27.434
IT'S THE PITY.
PEOPLE SEE US IN THESE THINGS,

13:27.470 --> 13:30.109
AND THEY FEEL SORRY FOR US.
IT'S LIKE WEARING HEADGEAR.

13:30.140 --> 13:32.131
BABY, DID YOU HAVE
TO WEAR HEADGEAR?

13:32.170 --> 13:33.569
JUST FOR A YEAR.

13:33.610 --> 13:34.929
(horn honks in distance)

13:34.980 --> 13:36.470
WAIT. WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO NICE TO ME?

13:36.510 --> 13:39.377

NO SURPRISE,
CONSIDERING WHAT HE DRIVES.
(beeps)

14:44.610 --> 14:46.475
OWNING A QUALITY AUTOMOBILE
ISN'T A SIN.

14:46.510 --> 14:49.217
SIR, YOURS IS LEASED, AND TODAY
YOU WENT A LITTLE OVERBOARD,

14:49.250 --> 14:51.218

14:51.250 --> 14:52.387
OOH.

15:46.370 --> 15:48.372
SO NO BOAT, NO TRUCK.
No, nothing.

15:48.410 --> 15:51.277
I MEAN... THERE'S NO SIGN

15:51.310 --> 15:52.379
WELL, IF NO ONE'S AT THE HOUSE,
MAYBE YOU GET IN THERE

15:52.410 --> 15:53.741

15:53.780 --> 15:55.441

15:55.480 --> 15:57.186
YOU'RE INSIDE THE OPERATION.
YOU'RE COVERED.

15:57.220 --> 15:59.142

police radio chatter)

15:59.190 --> 16:02.159

16:36.460 --> 16:37.984
HELLO?

16:40.760 --> 16:42.421
(door buzzes and beeps,
police radio chatter)

16:42.460 --> 16:44.189
AH, THIS IS MR. SWAREK.

16:44.230 --> 16:45.265
HELLO.

16:45.300 --> 16:48.189
MY MANAGER.
WHY AM I HERE?

16:48.240 --> 16:49.559
THIS INVESTIGATION ISN'T
MOVING ALONG FAST ENOUGH

16:49.600 --> 16:51.306
FOR MR. DENT'S TASTE.

16:51.340 --> 16:52.307
HONESTLY, HOW LONG DOES
IT TAKE TO PROCESS SOMEONE

16:52.340 --> 16:53.739
FOR A DRIVING CHARGE?

16:53.780 --> 16:56.169
SEE, IF I WERE YOU,
I'D STICK WITH NASH HERE.

16:56.210 --> 16:58.041
SHE'S YOUNG, SHE'S HUNGRY
TO PROVE HERSELF.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.219
ME, ON THE OTHER HAND,
I'VE BEEN AROUND A WHILE.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.410
I'M ON MY OWN CLOCK.

17:01.450 --> 17:04.339
I MARCH TO THE BEAT
OF MY OWN DRUM...MER.

17:04.390 --> 17:06.346
I-I TAKE TIME TO SMELL--

17:06.390 --> 17:07.516
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?!

17:07.560 --> 17:10.051
HEY, CALM DOWN. OKAY?

17:10.090 --> 17:11.250
NOW, DETECTIVE NASH,

17:11.290 --> 17:13.292
LET'S START AT THE BEGINNING,
SHALL WE?

17:13.330 --> 17:14.399
(door buzzes and beeps)

17:14.430 --> 17:17.194
DETECTIVE, YOU GOT A MINUTE?

17:17.230 --> 17:18.390
YEAH.

17:18.430 --> 17:21.433
(radio chatter)

17:22.400 --> 17:24.106
SO WHAT ARE YOU,
HIS LAWYER?

17:24.140 --> 17:26.506
NO. I'M JACOB BLACKSTONE.
DRUG SQUAD.

17:26.540 --> 17:29.236
THAT GUY IN THERE--
YOU GOTTA CUT HIM LOOSE.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.247
I MEAN, DO WHATEVER IT IS
YOU HAVE TO DO,

17:30.280 --> 17:32.498
BUT GET HIM OUTTA HERE.
WHY?

17:32.550 --> 17:34.142
OH, IT'S NOT A REQUEST.

17:34.180 --> 17:35.215
NO?

17:35.250 --> 17:36.649
HE'S A MENACE ON THE ROAD,

17:36.680 --> 17:38.489
AND HE'S PAIN IN THE ASS.

17:38.520 --> 17:39.418
OH, REALLY? SERIOUSLY?

17:39.450 --> 17:41.384
YOU GONNA MAKE ME
CALL YOUR BOSS? DUDE--

17:41.420 --> 17:42.250
"DUDE." "DUDE."
GO AHEAD. CALL MY BOSS.

17:42.290 --> 17:43.780
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHILE YOU'RE DOING THAT,

17:43.830 --> 17:45.479
I'LL JUST ASK OLD SIMON HERE
WHY THE DRUG SQUAD'S

17:45.530 --> 17:47.054
SO KEEN TO SEE HIM WALK.

17:48.530 --> 17:50.794
AHH.

18:16.490 --> 18:17.479
HEY, SWEETH EART.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.259
HEY. (chuckles)

18:19.290 --> 18:20.496
HOW'S IT GOIN'?

18:20.530 --> 18:21.497
GOOD. YOU SCARED ME.

18:21.530 --> 18:22.656
(chuckles)

18:22.700 --> 18:25.726
UM... LAST NIGHT WAS CRAZY,
HUH?

18:25.770 --> 18:28.364
I MEAN, WITH THOSE GUYS
SHOWING UP?

18:28.400 --> 18:29.435
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:29.470 --> 18:30.630
LOOKING FOR NICK.

18:30.670 --> 18:31.637
HUH.

18:31.670 --> 18:35.731
UM, THE DOOR WAS OPEN,
SO I JUST LET MYSELF IN.

18:35.780 --> 18:36.769
DID YOU FIND HIM?

18:36.810 --> 18:40.314
IN MY, UH, COMPUTER?

18:40.350 --> 18:42.409
NICK WOULD NEVER
GIVE ME YOUR NUMBER,

18:42.450 --> 18:43.712
SO I WAS LOOKING
FOR IT.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.843
SMART MAN.

18:45.890 --> 18:47.619
ANYWAY, HE'S DOWN
AT THE BEACH.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.218
HE IS?
YEAH.

18:49.260 --> 18:51.683
THAT'S GREAT. OKAY. GOOD.
I MEAN, I WAS REALLY WORRIED.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.755
YOU KNOW, LAST NIGHT
REALLY FREAKED ME OUT.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.892
YEAH, IT WAS PRETTY CRAZY,
HUH?

18:54.930 --> 18:56.227
THEY KNEW WHERE TO FIND US.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.397
STILL TRYING TO FIGURE
THAT ONE OUT.

18:57.430 --> 19:00.593
ONE THING--JUST NEED
TO GET YOUR PHONE.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.198
NEW RU LES, RIGHT?

19:02.240 --> 19:04.458
RIGHT. OKAY.

19:04.510 --> 19:07.399
UH...

19:07.440 --> 19:09.533
YOU KNOW WHAT? I LEFT IT
IN MY BAG OUTSIDE.

19:09.580 --> 19:11.172
I'LL GO GRAB THAT.

19:11.210 --> 19:12.609
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T BOTHER.
(smack)

19:12.650 --> 19:14.641
(thud)

19:30.330 --> 19:33.333
(rumbling)

19:35.640 --> 19:38.632
(breathing heavily)

19:48.680 --> 19:51.683
(grunting)

19:58.530 --> 20:00.259
NOW WE GOT METH COMING
OVER THE BORDER

20:00.300 --> 20:02.256
AT A RATE SO FAST,
WE CAN BARELY KEEP UP.

20:02.300 --> 20:03.267
AND WHERE'S IT
COMING IN FROM?

20:03.300 --> 20:04.426
WELL, MEXICO, ORIGINALLY,

20:04.470 --> 20:05.596
BUT THIS STUFF'S
BEEN HITTING TOWN

20:05.630 --> 20:06.790
BY WAY OF FORT ERIE.

20:06.830 --> 20:09.560
SIX MONTHS AGO, WE PLACED
TWO UNDERCOVERS AT THE BORDER.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.602
MCNALLY AND COLLINS?

20:11.640 --> 20:13.505
KEEP GOING.

20:15.410 --> 20:17.776
THE SHIPMENTS--THEY GO OUT
EVERY FEW WEEKS.

20:17.810 --> 20:19.744
THEY LEAVE
FROM THE SAME PLACE.

20:19.780 --> 20:21.247
THEY ARRIVE HERE IN TOWN,
AND THEN THEY GET DELIVERED

20:21.280 --> 20:23.419
TO ONE
OF MANY SMALL BUSINESSES--

20:23.450 --> 20:26.419
SOME BALLOON SHOP ON DUNDAS,
RICHMOND ARMS,

20:26.450 --> 20:28.486
SOUTH END AUTO BODY ON SPRUCE,
AND--

20:28.520 --> 20:30.351
LET ME GUESS.
UH, LUSH CATERING,

20:30.390 --> 20:33.393
RUN BY SIMON DENT,
THE IDIOT IN OUR LOCKUP.

20:33.430 --> 20:35.955
THERE YOU GO. HENCE,
SIMON NEEDS TO BE IN PLAY.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.422
TO DAY?
YEAH .

20:37.470 --> 20:42.260
WE, UH... STOLE SOME
OF THEIR PRODUCT LAST NIGHT.

20:42.300 --> 20:43.198
WHAT?

20:43.240 --> 20:44.969
WE STAGED IT TO LOOK LIKE
STEVE MCCOWAN

20:45.010 --> 20:47.399
WAS RIPPING THEM OFF.
WHY?

20:47.440 --> 20:48.907
'CAUSE WE WANTED TO KEEP THINGS
MOVING, AND GUESS WHAT?

20:48.940 --> 20:50.544
IT'S WORKING. THERE'S ANOTHER
TRUCK COMING IN TODAY.

20:50.580 --> 20:52.275
THAT'S WHY WE NEED SIMON THERE
TO RECEIVE IT.

20:52.310 --> 20:55.416
SO YOU PUT TWO U.C. OFFICERS
IN THE MIDDLE OF A TURF WAR.

20:55.450 --> 20:56.712
IF YOU KNOW
WHO'S SHIPPING THE DRUGS,

20:56.750 --> 20:57.978
WHY HAVEN'T
YOU ARRESTED THEM?

20:58.020 --> 21:00.045
TH ESE ARE KIDS.

21:00.090 --> 21:02.308
THEY'RE NOT A PROBLEM.
THEY'RE NOTHING.

21:02.360 --> 21:03.429
WHAT WE NEED IS TO CUT
THIS OFF AT THE HEAD.

21:03.460 --> 21:06.452
I NEED MR. DENT BACK
AT HIS STORE WITHIN THE HOUR.

21:06.490 --> 21:08.299
AND I NEED YOU GUYS
TO WALK AWAY,

21:08.330 --> 21:10.992
LEAVE THIS IN THE CAPABLE HANDS
OF THE DRUG SQUAD. UNDERSTOOD?

21:11.030 --> 21:12.463
WHAT ABOUT MY OFFICERS?

21:12.500 --> 21:13.637
(cell phone buzzes)
YOUR OFFICERS ARE FINE.

21:13.670 --> 21:16.366
WHY DON'T YOU DO ME A FAVOR
AND STOP BUSTING MY BALLS

21:16.400 --> 21:18.368
AND LET MY GUYS DO THEIR JOB?

21:18.410 --> 21:19.638
THAT'D BE GREAT. THANKS.
(beep)

21:19.670 --> 21:20.807
YEAH. GO AHEAD.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.603
SO WHAT ARE WE DOING,
FRANK?

21:22.640 --> 21:25.905
WHAT HE SAID.

21:25.950 --> 21:27.440
STEPPING ASIDE.

21:32.690 --> 21:35.056
ARE YOU UP FOR A DRIVE,
DETECTIVE?

21:35.090 --> 21:36.910
ABSOLUTELY, DETECTIVE.

21:38.590 --> 21:41.354
(radio chatter)
(exhales deeply) OKAY,
YOU TWO ARE GONNA RELEASE DENT,

21:41.400 --> 21:42.890
JUST LIKE JAKE BLACKSTONE WANTS.

21:42.930 --> 21:45.398
TAKE A GOOD LOOK
AROUND HIS PLACE, ALL RIGHT?

21:45.430 --> 21:46.226
WE'RE GONNA TAKE A DRIVE
TO THE BALLOON SHOP,

21:46.270 --> 21:47.931
SOUTH END AUTO BODY,
RICHMOND ARMS,

21:47.970 --> 21:50.564
SEE WHAT WE CAN SEE.
THE FASTER WE CAN MAKE

21:50.610 --> 21:52.532
ANY CONNECTIONS, THE BETTER,
ALL RIGHT?

21:52.570 --> 21:54.106
OKAY, I DON'T GET IT. WHY ISN'T
DRUG SQUAD HANDLING THIS?

21:54.140 --> 21:57.405
THEY HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES.

21:59.610 --> 22:01.976
TWO OF OUR OFFICERS ARE
WORKING UNDERCOVER ON THIS.

22:02.020 --> 22:04.511
WE'RE WORRIED DRUG SQUAD MAY
HAVE COMPROMISED THEIR SAFETY

22:04.550 --> 22:05.915
IN AN EFFORT
TO SPEED THINGS ALONG.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.918
SO WE'RE WORKING THIS
OFF THE BOOKS?

22:07.960 --> 22:09.757
YOU CAN SIT THIS ONE OUT,
OFFICER, IF YOU WANT.

22:09.790 --> 22:12.679
THEN WE SHOULD LIMIT OUR CHATTER
TO CHANNEL 4

22:12.730 --> 22:15.426
SO YOUR DRUG SQUAD GUY DOESN'T
GET HIS KNICKERS IN A TWIST.

22:15.460 --> 22:18.668
CHANNEL 4. GOOD IDEA.
LET'S GO.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.499
(Oliver) IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY,
MR. DENT.

22:22.540 --> 22:25.600
A LITTLE PROBLEM
WITH THE RADAR GUN.

22:25.640 --> 22:27.631
A ROOKIE FORGOT
TO CALIBRATE IT.

22:27.680 --> 22:28.908
(door buzzes)
YOUR CAR'S STILL IN IMPOUND,

22:28.940 --> 22:31.477
SO PLEASE ALLOW US TO ESCORT YOU
BACK TO YOUR PLACE OF BUSINESS

22:31.510 --> 22:33.000
SO YOU CAN CONTINUE YOUR DAY.

22:46.460 --> 22:49.452
(radio chatter)

22:54.640 --> 22:58.167
ONCE AGAIN,
SORRY ABOUT THE MIX-UP.

22:58.210 --> 23:01.475
(Siren wailing in distance)

23:04.750 --> 23:08.618
(whirring, cookware clattering)

23:08.650 --> 23:09.878
(Oliver) OH, IT'S A NICE PLACE
YOU GOT HERE.

23:09.920 --> 23:10.887
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING TONIGHT?

23:10.920 --> 23:12.512
TAPAS. WE DONE HERE?

23:12.550 --> 23:14.859
YEAH. I LOVE TAPAS.

23:14.890 --> 23:16.016
(crunching)

23:16.060 --> 23:16.981
(mouths full)
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

23:17.020 --> 23:18.487
(smacks lips)

23:18.530 --> 23:20.555
(dog barking)

23:20.600 --> 23:21.851
THIS IS CRUZ.
NOTHING AT THE BODY SHOP.

23:21.900 --> 23:25.529
PLACE IS LOCKED UP.
NO ONE'S AROUND.

23:25.570 --> 23:29.461
RICHMOND ARMS.
NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY.

23:29.500 --> 23:30.467
THOUGH LET'S FACE IT.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.432
WE DON'T EXACTLY KNOW
WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

23:32.470 --> 23:34.529
(radio receiver clicks)

23:34.580 --> 23:36.502
(horn honks in distance)

23:36.540 --> 23:37.746
THE CATERING COMPANY.

23:37.780 --> 23:39.805
DOV SAID
HE SAW PROPANE TANKS.
YEAH.

23:39.850 --> 23:41.818
OKAY, SO MY FRESHMAN YEAR
OF HIGH SCHOOL,

23:41.850 --> 23:43.044
I WORKED
AT GIGGLING GRANNIES.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.217
WE USED TO SELL BUNDLES
OF BALLOONS

23:44.250 --> 23:47.219
FOR KIDS' BIRTHDAY PARTIES.
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

23:47.250 --> 23:50.549
THAT YOUR SECRET PAST IS
EVEN MORE BORING THAN MCNALLY'S.

23:50.590 --> 23:53.593
HELIUM. WE USED TO GET
DELIVERIES EVERY COUPLE WEEKS,

23:53.630 --> 23:55.825
AND THE GAS COMPANY WOULD
DROP OFF FULL TANKS,

23:55.860 --> 23:57.157
COLLECT THE EMPTY ONES.

23:57.200 --> 24:00.465
BUT THE GAS SERVICE DIDN'T
DEAL EXCLUSIVELY IN HELIUM.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.468
PROPANE. BODY SHOPS
USE ACETYLENE.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.866
WHAT IF THESE GUYS ARE ALL USING
THE SAME GAS DELIVERY SERVICE?

24:04.910 --> 24:06.229
SOMETHING.

24:06.270 --> 24:07.806
OKAY. CALL EVERYBODY BACK.

24:07.840 --> 24:09.205
LET'S GET BLACKSTONE
ON THE PHONE.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.434
(turns key)

24:11.680 --> 24:14.478
(brakes squealing,
truck rumbles)

24:16.720 --> 24:18.449
(engine turns off)

24:22.760 --> 24:24.887
(dog barking in distance)

24:24.930 --> 24:26.955
UHH!

24:26.990 --> 24:28.890
HEY, HEY, HEY.
(muffled shouting)

24:28.930 --> 24:30.921
WHAT IS GOING ON?
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE?

24:30.970 --> 24:31.868
SHE CAME LOOKING FOR YOU.
SHE BROKE INTO THE HOUSE.

24:31.900 --> 24:33.128
I HAD TO BRING HER.
I HAD TO BRING HER.

24:33.170 --> 24:34.262
P.J., INSIDE.
EASY.

24:34.300 --> 24:35.528
DON'T TOUCH HER.
DON'T TOUCH HER.

24:35.570 --> 24:37.629
CALM DOWN. HEY, HEY, HEY. WE'RE
JUST GONNA TALK ABOUT IT INSIDE.

24:37.670 --> 24:39.934
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL, OKAY?

24:39.970 --> 24:42.530
(radio chatter)

24:42.580 --> 24:43.501
(telephone rings)

24:45.980 --> 24:47.004
(telephone ringing in distance)

24:47.050 --> 24:49.518
(door opens)
OKAY, WHAT PART OF
"LEAVE THIS TO ME"

24:49.550 --> 24:51.518
DO YOU GUYS
NOT UNDERSTAND?

24:51.550 --> 24:53.518
HEAR US OUT.
THE PART ABOUT THE TWO YOUNG
OFFICERS YOU HUNG OUT TO DRY.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.209
I ASKED YOU GUYS
TO DO ONE THING.

24:55.260 --> 24:57.285
AND WE DID.
ONE THING'S ALL I ASKED.

24:57.320 --> 24:58.526
AND WE DID. WE JUST WANTED
TO BRING SOMETHING ELSE

24:58.560 --> 24:59.584
TO YOUR ATTENTION.

24:59.630 --> 25:00.858
GREAT. SHOOT.

25:00.900 --> 25:03.095
THE PUB, BALLOON STORE,
BODY SHOP, CATERER--

25:03.130 --> 25:04.768
THEY ALL HAVE ONE THING
IN COMMON.

25:04.800 --> 25:08.031
EASTON GAS SERVICES
ALL FOUR BUSINESSES.

25:08.070 --> 25:09.230
THEY COULD BE USING
EMPTY GAS TANKS

25:09.270 --> 25:12.307
TO PICK UP THE DRUGS, DELIVER
THEM TO A CENTRAL WAREHOUSE.

25:12.340 --> 25:13.409
CONGRATULATIONS, GUYS.

25:13.440 --> 25:16.705
THAT TOOK US ABOUT TWO WEEKS
TO FIGURE THAT ONE OUT.

25:16.740 --> 25:19.675
SO WHAT ARE WE DOING
ABOUT IT?
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE
WORKING ON THE WARRANTS.

25:19.710 --> 25:21.575
WE'RE GETTING OUR DUCKS
IN A ROW.
YOU'RE WORKING ON WARRANTS?

25:21.620 --> 25:23.542
THAT'S RIGHT. WE DON'T WANT
JUST SOME OF THEM.

25:23.590 --> 25:24.579
WE WANT ALL OF 'EM--
THE ENTIRE GANG.

25:24.620 --> 25:25.644
THAT'S GONNA TAKE
A LOT OF WARRANTS.

25:25.690 --> 25:26.884
IT'S A NIGHTMARE.

25:26.920 --> 25:28.615
OKAY, FINE.
SO PULL OUR PEOPLE OUT.

25:28.660 --> 25:29.684
I CAN'T.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.187
WHY?

25:31.230 --> 25:34.825
BECAUSE I...
I CAN'T REACH THEM.

25:34.860 --> 25:36.691
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM COLLINS
IN 12 HOURS.

25:36.730 --> 25:38.288
WE'RE NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING
UNTIL WE DO.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.160
UH... WHAT ABOUT MCNALLY?

25:41.200 --> 25:44.328
YEAH, SHE'S--SHE'S BEEN OFF
THE WIRE SINCE THIS AFTERNOON.

25:44.370 --> 25:47.339
YOU'RE TELLING US
YOU LOST BOTH OF THEM?

25:47.370 --> 25:49.201
IT'S FINE. WE GOT A SPIN TEAM
WORKING ON IT.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.309
YOU DON'T KNOW MCNALLY,
ALL RIGHT?

25:50.340 --> 25:53.104

28:16.360 --> 28:17.509
YEAH, I HAVE A GUN,
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE

28:17.560 --> 28:18.458
CHOOSE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES.

28:18.490 --> 28:20.321
OKAY, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT YOU GUYS DO.

28:20.360 --> 28:21.327
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING TO ANYONE,

28:54.400 --> 28:56.095
SHE DIDN'T SAY NOTHING! NOTHING!
I'M NOT GONNA SHOOT HER.

28:56.130 --> 29:00.021
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.
IT'S HER, OR IT'S BOTH OF YOU.
