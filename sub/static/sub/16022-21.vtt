I'm standing live in front

00:36.504 --> 00:38.570
Has been killed...
Mr. Berman,

00:38.572 --> 00:39.605
I've been told, is nowhere

00:39.607 --> 00:41.073
(barking)
to be found.

00:41.075 --> 00:42.241
Hey, anderson cooper.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.275
What?
Yeah, you.

00:43.277 --> 00:44.710
Do a 180 and take a hike.

00:44.712 --> 00:47.146
I don't care
about freedom of the press.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.714
Move the perimeter back.

00:48.716 --> 00:51.617
And somebody shut
that damn dog up.

00:51.619 --> 00:54.253
Where is lee berman?!

00:54.255 --> 00:55.487
Where's the husband?

00:55.489 --> 00:57.056
Metcalf, smith,

00:57.058 --> 01:00.092
I want to talk to him
in ten minutes.

01:00.094 --> 01:01.427
(siren whooping)

01:01.429 --> 01:04.229
Akers:
Turn the car off.

01:04.231 --> 01:06.632
Step out of the vehicle and
get your hands in the air.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.702
Do you know who I am?

01:10.704 --> 01:12.171
Lee berman.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.273
I own the tangiers.
Ring a bell?

01:14.275 --> 01:15.607
One call
to sheriff ecklie,

01:15.609 --> 01:18.544
And I turn you all
into mall cops.

01:18.546 --> 01:19.812
Looks like we got a gun
in the car, boys.

01:19.814 --> 01:21.246
Nine-millimeter.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.281
Don't cuff him yet, akers.

01:22.283 --> 01:25.617
Spin him around here.
I'll process him on site.

01:25.619 --> 01:28.587
Right hand. Palm down.

01:32.659 --> 01:34.259
Okay, now you can hook him.

01:34.261 --> 01:38.797
Mr. Berman, you are under arrest
for suspicion of murder.

01:38.799 --> 01:41.567
Murder? Who died?

01:41.569 --> 01:43.635
Your wife.

02:01.721 --> 02:03.622
(mechanical whirring)

02:21.474 --> 02:22.674
Hmm.

02:25.912 --> 02:28.180
Ah.

02:28.182 --> 02:29.648
Oh, there you go.

02:32.852 --> 02:34.853
Hey.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.588
Smart house, right?

02:36.590 --> 02:37.890
You walk into the room,
lights go on.

02:37.892 --> 02:39.424
You walk out,
they go off.

02:39.426 --> 02:40.759
Yeah, I know.

02:40.761 --> 02:43.762
Me and umbrella man
just lit up together.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.297
I'm assuming

02:45.299 --> 02:47.633
That one
of the 18 cameras outside

02:47.635 --> 02:49.501
Got a good look
at our killer.

02:49.503 --> 02:52.905
Actually, someone
outsmarted the smart house.

02:52.907 --> 02:55.774
Alarm system and surveillance
cameras were disabled

02:55.776 --> 02:57.843
At 4:17 a.M.
For an hour.

02:57.845 --> 02:58.911
Remotely.

02:58.913 --> 03:00.846
The good news is

03:00.848 --> 03:03.916
The motion sensors still tracked
the path of entry:

03:03.918 --> 03:05.918
From the garage, down the hall,

03:05.920 --> 03:08.620
Through the foyer,
into the master bedroom.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.389
In and out in less
than six minutes.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.191
No wrong turns.

03:12.193 --> 03:17.863
Whoever killed audrey berman
was familiar with the house.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.969
D.B.

03:23.971 --> 03:26.672
First two shots were not
immediately fatal.

03:26.674 --> 03:30.609
<i>Third shot,</i>
<i>she wasn't so lucky.</i>

03:30.611 --> 03:31.877
(gunshot)

03:31.879 --> 03:33.412
She gave it a valiant effort.

03:33.414 --> 03:36.348
Almost made it
to those doors.

03:38.685 --> 03:39.885
Nine-mil.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.920
Same caliber as the gun

03:41.922 --> 03:43.589
That nick found
in berman's car.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.591
So busy killing
his wife, he forgot

03:45.593 --> 03:46.892
To pick up the casings.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.860
Crime of passion.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.596
Could be trouble
in paradise.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.531
His nightstand's
completely empty.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.333
Look at hers.

03:55.468 --> 03:57.903
She also took over both sides
of the closet.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.572
So I'm thinking
that mr. Berman moved out

04:00.574 --> 04:02.374
Of this room a while ago.

04:22.362 --> 04:24.263
Well, hello there.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.978
Hey, boss.
Thanks for getting back to me.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.813
Man:
Did you ask for a plane?

04:41.815 --> 04:43.315
Yes, sir, I did request a plane.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.549
That's out of the question.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.018
Wait, hear me out.

04:46.020 --> 04:48.287
You know the "kitty" case
that I've been tracking?

04:48.289 --> 04:49.755
Yeah.
Well, one of her targets,

04:49.757 --> 04:50.822
Lee berman--
his wife was murdered.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.692
Which tells me
our node is there.

04:53.694 --> 04:54.960
But for how long?

04:54.962 --> 04:56.061
Ryan, we don't have
the resources

04:56.063 --> 04:58.063
To send you out there
at this time.

04:58.065 --> 05:01.566
You know these cybercriminals--
they're like gophers.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.969
If you don't grab 'em
when they pop their head out,

05:03.971 --> 05:05.737
They're gone forever.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.606
I'll see what I can do.
Clock's ticking.

to st. Thomas

05:55.522 --> 05:57.489
Until the deputy director
called.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.857
Ordered me to detour
to vegas.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.392
With all due respect,
ma'am,

06:00.394 --> 06:02.594
We're not running
a taxi service here.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.396
So why don't you save uncle sam
a couple of bucks

06:04.398 --> 06:08.467
Captain, I'm gonna tell you
three things about yourself,

06:08.469 --> 06:10.469
None of which you're gonna like.

06:10.471 --> 06:13.004
Number one, there's no
such thing as an up and back

06:13.006 --> 06:15.674
To the virgin islands-- you go
there, you're staying the night.

06:15.676 --> 06:17.476
And your
returning there,

06:17.478 --> 06:19.411
It's not for mrs. Captain.

06:19.413 --> 06:22.514
Number two, you and I
both know, morally...

06:22.516 --> 06:24.483
Okay. Wheels up.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.017
Let's get agent ryan
to vegas.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.452
Grab my bags.

06:31.691 --> 06:34.059
Okay, gentlemen,
this is las vegas.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.527
I'll deal.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.129
When was the last time
you saw your wife?

06:37.131 --> 06:38.730
Yesterday morning.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.400
I got you beat.

06:45.772 --> 06:48.039
We saw her last night.

06:48.041 --> 06:50.142
I didn't kill my wife.

06:50.144 --> 06:53.645
Here's a photo of the nine-mil
we found on the front seat

06:53.647 --> 06:55.514
Of your aston martin.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.649
These are the shell casings
that you left behind

06:57.651 --> 06:58.717
In your wife's bedroom.

06:58.719 --> 07:02.621
Now, that's the only evidence
we have of you in that room.

07:02.623 --> 07:05.590
That's because you've been
living in the guest bedroom

07:05.592 --> 07:08.627
With another piece of tail.

07:10.062 --> 07:12.731
I want to know everything
about this girl.

07:12.733 --> 07:15.801
Who is she? And where is she?

07:15.803 --> 07:18.437
Okay.

07:18.439 --> 07:21.106
Let me play it out for you.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.642
Your marriage is a bust.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.811
Nevada's a community property
state, right?

07:25.813 --> 07:27.813
Your wife
is going south.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.848
The new chick
is heading north.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.516
It's a classic trade-up.

07:31.518 --> 07:33.885
You killed your wife
to be with her.

07:33.887 --> 07:36.154
Now, as the comics
in the lounge act

07:36.156 --> 07:38.557
At the tangiers
like to say,

07:38.559 --> 07:40.892
How am I doing?

07:40.894 --> 07:42.127
This brass is good.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.895
And he's asking
all the right questions;

07:43.897 --> 07:47.165
Just not my question.

07:47.167 --> 07:50.502
Do you mind
if we change dealers?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.009
Good morning, mr. Berman.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.212
Fbi special agent ryan.

08:00.214 --> 08:02.481
Cyber crimes division.

08:03.616 --> 08:07.552
I'm not gonna ask you
if you murdered your wife.

08:07.554 --> 08:10.822
I'm more interested
in a relationship

08:10.824 --> 08:13.158
You've been having
with a woman online.

08:16.562 --> 08:18.029
Her name's kitty, right?

08:21.033 --> 08:23.134
The way your pupils
just dilated,

08:23.136 --> 08:25.570
I'd say there was a little more
than chitchat going on

08:25.572 --> 08:27.105
In that chat.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.508
Ten-stars-vip.Com.

08:29.510 --> 08:30.642
That ring a bell?

08:30.644 --> 08:34.012
An exclusive
vip sex site

08:34.014 --> 08:37.816
For affluent men willing to pay
for anonymity.

08:38.885 --> 08:41.119
I could say more.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.655
Everyone with a law degree,
take a hike.

08:43.657 --> 08:44.656
Man:
Mr. Berman,

08:44.658 --> 08:45.790
I strong...

08:50.296 --> 08:52.664
(door opens)

08:52.666 --> 08:55.534
Want to know something funny?

08:55.536 --> 08:58.103
You and I were both
seeing kitty.

08:59.805 --> 09:03.575
So, I log in
under an assumed name, ralph,

09:03.577 --> 09:05.677
A lonely rancher
from montana.

09:05.679 --> 09:08.813
After about a month,
kitty sends me a virtual gift.

09:08.815 --> 09:12.584
And when I refuse to open it,
she kicks me off the site.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.653
So back
at quantico,

09:14.655 --> 09:18.990
I get male agents to log in
under assumed names.

09:18.992 --> 09:21.693
But even when we open
the gift,

09:21.695 --> 09:24.229
Still she kicks us off the site.

09:24.231 --> 09:27.232
You want
to know why?

09:27.234 --> 09:29.568
'cause kitty is only interested
in wealthy men

09:29.570 --> 09:31.703
That she can verify.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.805
Well-known men,
like you.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.774
You opened the gift, didn't you?

09:35.776 --> 09:38.777
I didn't get any gift.

09:38.779 --> 09:41.646
I'm a behavioral scientist.

09:41.648 --> 09:44.049
Fancy for "human lie detector."

09:48.788 --> 09:50.789
Okay.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.757
I got a gift.

09:57.196 --> 09:59.764
<i>I opened it.</i>

09:59.766 --> 10:01.366
<i>The chat box went away,</i>

10:01.368 --> 10:02.834
<i>And I could talk to her.</i>

10:02.836 --> 10:04.970
No more typing.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.638
Hands-free,

10:06.640 --> 10:08.640
So to speak.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.141
How long
did this honeymoon last?

10:10.776 --> 10:11.910
A week.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.212
Ten days.

10:15.181 --> 10:16.848
Then it ended.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.750
I ended it.

10:18.752 --> 10:19.884
You're lying again.

10:21.387 --> 10:24.823
Here's my big question:

10:24.825 --> 10:27.892
What did kitty have on you?

10:31.897 --> 10:35.634
Call my lawyers back in here.

10:39.672 --> 10:43.074
Ran facial recognition
on our mystery woman.

10:43.076 --> 10:44.743
No hits in the nevada dmv.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.978
You're not gonna find her
in any database.

10:47.781 --> 10:51.316
I can help you with that.
Everybody, uh,

10:51.318 --> 10:53.151
This is special agent ryan.

10:53.153 --> 10:57.789
She's a cyber psychologist,
specializing in cyber forensics,

10:57.791 --> 10:59.891
And I'm afraid
I don't know anything else.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.960
May I?

11:11.704 --> 11:13.438
(beeping)

11:17.777 --> 11:19.411
Clikk, you there?

11:19.413 --> 11:21.880
Yes, ma'am.
Get me into kitty.

11:21.882 --> 11:26.384
Logging into ten-stars-vip.Com.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.086
White label user.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.722
All I need is a name.
All right, csi, give me a name.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.957
Hodges. That's
a good name.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.159
All right, stand up.

11:36.062 --> 11:37.896
Are you a sex site guy?

11:37.898 --> 11:38.863
No, ma'am.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.065
Ryan:
You ever been

11:40.067 --> 11:41.900

11:41.902 --> 11:43.068
No, ma'am.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.703
Mm, you sure
about that?

11:45.805 --> 11:46.805
First name?

11:46.807 --> 11:47.806
Uh, that would be david.

11:47.808 --> 11:48.907
Clikk,

11:48.909 --> 11:50.875
Verify david hodges.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.444
Stokes (chuckles):
Oh, it's the fbi, man--

11:52.446 --> 11:53.845
You're toast.

11:53.847 --> 11:55.146
(clikk whistles)

11:55.148 --> 11:57.816
A little deceptive
on the sex sites.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.984
But he's never been
to ten-stars-vip.

11:59.986 --> 12:01.052
Hodges:
Okay...

12:01.054 --> 12:02.721
Uh, I can explain that.

12:02.723 --> 12:04.189
I had a fiancée...

12:04.191 --> 12:06.157
At ease, stud.
Just... Just fall back.

12:07.159 --> 12:08.827
You are science cops.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.229
Ryan:
I'm a cyber cop.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.732
I work crimes
that start in the mind,

12:13.734 --> 12:17.068
Live online
and play out in the real world.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.970
You work dark alleys.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.805
I work the dark net.

12:21.941 --> 12:23.374
You chase suspects.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.176
I chase nodes.

12:25.178 --> 12:28.980
Ryan:
"node," short for "bad guy."

12:28.982 --> 12:31.082
Little childlike drawing.

12:31.851 --> 12:35.320
This iceberg represents
the internet.

12:35.322 --> 12:37.522
And believe it or not,
the world only uses this top

12:37.524 --> 12:38.957
Four percent.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.959
The tip.
The surface web.

12:40.961 --> 12:44.462
I work down here,
in the 96%,

12:44.464 --> 12:45.864
In the deep web,

12:45.866 --> 12:47.932
Where criminals
are anonymous,

12:47.934 --> 12:49.868
Where money... Is untraceable,

12:49.870 --> 12:51.970
And where everything
illegal's for sale.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.805
And what does this
have to do with mr. Berman?

12:53.807 --> 12:55.940
Well, berman's having
a relationship

12:55.942 --> 12:57.342
With your mystery woman,

12:57.344 --> 13:00.111
A woman named kitty--
and kitty...

13:00.113 --> 13:02.013
She's one of a kind.

13:02.815 --> 13:04.048
What's your name?

13:04.917 --> 13:06.851
Kitty.

13:06.853 --> 13:09.821
Because the more you pet me,
the more I purr.

13:09.823 --> 13:11.122
What's your name?

13:11.124 --> 13:14.058
Ryan:
David. Kitty-- ooh, I like that.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.127
Kitty:
What else do you like, david?

13:16.129 --> 13:18.129
Ryan:
Oh, I like sex.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.831
I like sex, too.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.166
Ryan:
What are you into?

13:21.168 --> 13:22.867
Everything.

13:22.869 --> 13:24.135
Name it.

13:24.137 --> 13:27.839
How many legs on a bicycle?

13:27.841 --> 13:30.108
So, you're a leg man?

13:30.110 --> 13:31.342
How many bicycles on a leg?

13:31.344 --> 13:32.977
You want to ride me?

13:32.979 --> 13:34.479
Finlay:
Wow, she always brings it

13:34.481 --> 13:35.914
Right back to sex.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.582
Sex is her business.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.317
Now, we're gonna have
a little fun.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.886
Ryan:
I'm gonna frustrate
the algorithm

13:41.888 --> 13:43.321
With a nonresponsive response.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.256
You want to ride me?

13:45.258 --> 13:46.991
You want to ride me hard?

13:48.227 --> 13:49.961
Chain. Yank. Sweat.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.497
Wet. Bleed. Finger. Lick.

13:52.499 --> 13:53.965
Tongue. Ass. Ride.

13:53.967 --> 13:56.935
Ride. Ride. Ride. Ride.

13:56.937 --> 14:00.038
(repeating rapidly):
Ri...

14:01.507 --> 14:05.343
(distorted):
Ride. Ride. Ride. Ride.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.947
Ride. Ride. Ride. Ride. Ride...

14:08.949 --> 14:12.050
What the hell kind
of sex site is this?

14:12.052 --> 14:14.185
Ryan:
My team has been tracking kitty
for six weeks.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.355
She is a computer-animated
avatar chatbot

14:17.357 --> 14:19.591
With machine-learning
artificial intelligence.

14:19.593 --> 14:21.960
Okay, good, we're all caught up
now.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.194
So...

14:23.196 --> 14:25.129
She's not real.

14:25.131 --> 14:27.498
But the person
who created her is.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.202
That's why I'm here.

14:42.147 --> 14:44.983
What's with
the mushrooms?

14:44.985 --> 14:47.151
It's in my nature to nurture.

14:47.153 --> 14:49.988
I guess I threw you
a little curveball

14:49.990 --> 14:51.990
With kitty, didn't I?
You know, all this

14:51.992 --> 14:54.659
Cyber hocus-pocus
is fascinating, but...

14:54.661 --> 14:56.160
Now what?

14:56.162 --> 14:58.630
I still have
a dead woman downstairs,

14:58.632 --> 15:01.366
A casino mogul
with gsr on his hands,

15:01.368 --> 15:03.001
A gun on the front seat.

15:03.003 --> 15:05.236
Up until now,
I've been thinking that

15:05.238 --> 15:07.672
Lee berman killed
his wife for a...

15:07.674 --> 15:09.274
A younger woman online.

15:09.276 --> 15:12.076
You come along,
you tap a few keys,

15:12.078 --> 15:16.014
And then you reduce our motive
to a bunch of digital bits.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.215
So...

15:17.217 --> 15:18.917
Where's that leave me?

15:18.919 --> 15:21.152
Can you cut me csi finlay?

15:21.154 --> 15:25.189
I'm bucking time here.
I really need to get into
the husband's computer.

15:25.191 --> 15:27.058
Why her?

15:27.060 --> 15:29.060
Men. Sex sites.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.229
They're time assassins.
Fine with me.

15:31.231 --> 15:34.132
But lee berman's computer
wiped out right in my hands,

15:34.134 --> 15:36.334
So...
Was a sledge hammer involved?

15:36.336 --> 15:38.636
No.

Then... The data's still there.

No more chat box.
No more typing.

I wish I could see you.

16:59.586 --> 17:02.086
You're doing great.

17:02.088 --> 17:06.090
So berman made a sex tape
and didn't even know it.

17:06.092 --> 17:08.059
People forget
the cameras

17:08.061 --> 17:10.728
On their laptops, their tablets,
their cell phones--

17:10.730 --> 17:12.263
They're cameras.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.531
They record.

17:13.533 --> 17:17.668
Like berman were being targeted,
money was the end game.

17:17.670 --> 17:20.204
And the good news
about his two-way cam is that

17:20.206 --> 17:22.440
It recorded every one
of their encounters.

17:22.442 --> 17:26.310
Everything from their first
hello to their last good-bye.

17:26.312 --> 17:28.780
I imagine you pinning me down,

17:28.782 --> 17:31.349
Taking me against my will.

17:33.552 --> 17:35.353
Wait.

Then why is
she massaging

It's usually the sign of an
underlying medical condition.

17:53.705 --> 17:57.108
Don't you want to see
how it ends?

17:57.676 --> 17:59.143
David.

17:59.145 --> 18:00.211
Hey.

18:00.213 --> 18:01.746
I was just bringing
this to you.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.114
Saves me the trip.

18:03.116 --> 18:04.615

18:04.617 --> 18:06.384
Nine-mil, right?
Mm-hmm.

What a shame.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.393
Audrey berman
was a great lady.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.829
Heart of gold when
it came to this town,

18:17.831 --> 18:19.864
And a very good friend
of mine, too.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.766
Can't say the same
for her husband.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.801
It's always the better half
that gets punished

18:23.803 --> 18:24.836
For the other half's sins.

18:24.838 --> 18:27.205
What do you got there?

18:27.207 --> 18:29.340
Is that a bruise
on the ring finger?

18:29.342 --> 18:31.442
Minute abrasions
along the knuckle.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.711
They weren't apparent
at the scene.

18:35.715 --> 18:39.250
Wedding ring wasn't in
her personal effects.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.686
Wasn't in evidence, either.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.821

19:13.785 --> 19:16.821
Berman have a
carry permit?
I checked.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.790
He is a regular member of
the gun club off blue diamond.

19:19.792 --> 19:23.794
Gsr on guns is like paint--
it sticks around.

19:23.796 --> 19:24.929
Maybe long enough

19:24.931 --> 19:26.464
To transfer to his hands

19:26.466 --> 19:28.166
When he handled it last night.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.800
If the gun wasn't
the murder weapon, though,

19:29.802 --> 19:31.669
Why did berman have it

There's got to be a reason.

It's like a detective on wheels.
You just give it

19:47.687 --> 19:50.254
A csi badge and
a field kit.

19:50.256 --> 19:52.523
I did run diagnostics.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.825
According to csi aston,

19:54.827 --> 19:58.462
From the tangiers,
berman manually entered

19:58.464 --> 20:01.632
His gps coordinates at 4:15 a.M.

20:01.634 --> 20:04.936
Arriving at his destination,
industrial park,

20:04.938 --> 20:06.671
At 5:13 a.M.

20:06.673 --> 20:07.972
And then, of course,

20:07.974 --> 20:09.874
I handcuffed him at 5:37.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.976
So he was
nowhere near the scene.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.844
He couldn't
have killed his wife.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.346
But that
doesn't mean

20:15.348 --> 20:16.747
He didn't pay for it.

20:16.749 --> 20:17.915
That bag I found
in the trunk

20:17.917 --> 20:19.984
Could have been used

Berman hires some guy

meets him in the park

20:27.760 --> 20:29.827
An hour later
for the payoff.

I mean...
That does fit the timeline.

20:31.965 --> 20:34.398
I'm not sure it fits
the logic, though.

Yeah...

We're missing something.

20:52.918 --> 20:55.753
This may be
what you're missing.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.388
You're gonna pay,

20:57.390 --> 20:58.956

Same drill-- wire the money,
convert it to bitcoins.

21:28.655 --> 21:29.820

Ryan:
Kitty's not a sadist.

21:53.613 --> 21:55.479
Her creator is.
A psycho-sadist.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.415
Most likely male.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.984
He derives pleasure
from inflicting pain on others.

21:59.986 --> 22:00.951
Physical, emotional,

22:00.953 --> 22:02.653
Financial.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.922
Berman didn't pay
to have his wife killed.

22:04.924 --> 22:07.391
He paid the sadist to spare her.

22:07.393 --> 22:09.927
But he didn't spare her.
She's dead.

22:09.929 --> 22:13.331
The second that berman
initiated this power struggle

22:13.333 --> 22:17.335
With his "my terms" bravado,
the sadist got pissed.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.870
So he killed berman's wife
and he took his money.

22:19.872 --> 22:22.873
Which means berman's the only
person who's ever seen this guy.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.975
First you tell me
this girl is fake,

22:24.977 --> 22:27.011
And now you're
telling me the "guy"

22:27.013 --> 22:28.446
Who was shaking me down

22:28.448 --> 22:30.548
Killed my wife?
Hey, mr. Berman,

22:30.550 --> 22:32.717
We have you on tape

22:32.719 --> 22:35.386
Agreeing to pay
$2 million cash.

22:35.388 --> 22:37.421
Question is, who'd
you give it to?

22:37.423 --> 22:39.023
Ryan:
You can't pay $2 million

22:39.025 --> 22:41.926
To a chatbot.
So who'd you pay the money to?

22:41.928 --> 22:43.627
(indistinct whispering)

22:43.629 --> 22:46.097
Oh, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

22:47.699 --> 22:50.401
There never was any cash,
was there?

22:50.403 --> 22:53.471
You went to the
industrial park--

22:53.473 --> 22:55.906
Not to pay kitty,
but to kill her.

22:55.908 --> 22:58.042
And when you got there,
I'm guessing

22:58.044 --> 23:00.644
All you had was
your gun in your hand.

23:03.014 --> 23:05.516
Gun in my hand?

23:05.518 --> 23:07.017
That's a polite way to say it.

23:13.158 --> 23:15.059
<i>No one showed.</i>

23:17.662 --> 23:21.599
I didn't
say it before because...

23:21.601 --> 23:24.168
Because I was ashamed.

23:26.004 --> 23:29.874
I'm fooling around
online and...

23:29.876 --> 23:33.644
It gets my wife killed.

23:33.646 --> 23:36.547
That's the first
honest thing you've said.

23:39.751 --> 23:42.153
I'd like to thank
both the fbi and the lvpd

23:42.155 --> 23:44.188
For proving what
we knew all along.

23:44.190 --> 23:45.956
Mr. Berman is innocent.

23:45.958 --> 23:47.191
And we're out of here.

23:59.871 --> 24:02.006
Kitty?

24:02.008 --> 24:04.742
Kitty. Kitty.
It's you.

24:04.744 --> 24:07.211
What the hell
is going on?

24:07.213 --> 24:09.213
They said
she wasn't real!

24:09.215 --> 24:10.214
Lawyer:
Calm down!

24:10.216 --> 24:11.449
I'm looking for the person

24:11.451 --> 24:12.716
Who gave my picture
to the press.

24:22.761 --> 24:25.663
My name is susan mcdowell.
I'm from san diego.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.031
I'm cooking dinner
for my little girls.

24:27.033 --> 24:29.934
I look up and I'm
all over the tv.

24:29.936 --> 24:32.470
The other woman in
a love triangle.

24:32.472 --> 24:35.139
Every story mentions the
las vegas police department.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.174
I drove five hours.
I want answers.

24:37.176 --> 24:40.644
I understand.
I want some myself.

24:41.546 --> 24:43.647
(clears throat)

24:43.649 --> 24:46.650
I put your photo out there.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.620
The fbi is working a case,

24:49.622 --> 24:50.988
And you're a person of interest.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.823
Person of interest?
Are you kidding me?

24:52.825 --> 24:54.225
Do you use social networks?

24:54.227 --> 24:56.126
Are you even
listening to me?

24:56.128 --> 24:59.563
I have a husband overseas
serving his country.

24:59.565 --> 25:02.032
I am trying to hold
my family together.

25:02.034 --> 25:04.068
That guy in the hall, he
is not the first person

25:04.070 --> 25:06.904
To call me kitty.
What about facebook?

25:06.906 --> 25:09.039
Instagram? Snapchat?

25:09.041 --> 25:10.207
Vine?

25:10.209 --> 25:11.909
Yes. I'm on friend agenda.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.777
My husband's stationed
in afghanistan.

25:13.779 --> 25:16.080
It's the only way we
get to see each other.

25:16.082 --> 25:18.182
How often are you on it?

25:18.184 --> 25:19.683
Every day.

25:19.685 --> 25:23.053
I send bradley photos
and videos of the girls.

25:23.055 --> 25:25.723
I post whatever I can to
bring our life to him.

25:25.725 --> 25:28.225
Do you grind your teeth
at night?

25:28.227 --> 25:29.527
How do you know that?

25:29.529 --> 25:31.161
You're massaging your jaw.

25:31.163 --> 25:33.163
You have an idiosyncratic
medical condition.

25:33.165 --> 25:36.133
I'm guessing it's tmj.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.769
It started when my
husband deployed.
It's how

25:38.771 --> 25:39.970
I knew you were out there.

25:39.972 --> 25:43.240
And it's why
I released her photo.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.608
Mrs. Mcdowell,

25:44.610 --> 25:46.610
Someone took your face,

25:46.612 --> 25:47.778
Your body

25:47.780 --> 25:49.113
And your mannerisms,

25:49.115 --> 25:50.948
And they made a virtual you.

25:50.950 --> 25:54.618
They gave it a name, kitty,
and they put it on a sex site.

25:54.620 --> 25:57.755
The guy who did it is now
making millions of dollars.

25:57.757 --> 26:00.090
How could he do that?

26:00.092 --> 26:03.060
I think we need to assess
your social vulnerability.

26:07.599 --> 26:09.833
Ryan:
This is your friend agenda page.

26:09.835 --> 26:12.269
Do you recognize
any of these six people?

26:14.005 --> 26:18.175
Wittygirl285 is a girl
I went to school with.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.144
Barbarasd is an

26:20.146 --> 26:22.880
Over-caffeinated mom
trying to set up a playdate.

26:22.882 --> 26:24.348
I don't know
the other four.

26:24.350 --> 26:26.884
Today, these
are the top six people

26:26.886 --> 26:28.752
Who viewed your site.
Not your friends.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.020
Your wannabe friends.

26:30.022 --> 26:33.257
Your top hit is nebula1.
Who's he?

26:33.259 --> 26:34.959
I have no clue.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.227
Well, he visited your site

26:37.229 --> 26:40.798
2,507 times
in the last six months.

26:40.800 --> 26:43.067
That's 15
times a day.

26:43.069 --> 26:45.269
Playdate mom?
She was there two times a week.

26:46.705 --> 26:48.238
That guy hiding behind
the smiley face--

26:48.240 --> 26:50.374
He's the one that
did this to me?

26:50.376 --> 26:52.910
2,500 times? Really?

26:52.912 --> 26:55.145
I have two little girls.

26:55.147 --> 26:56.947
What if this guy comes after us?

26:56.949 --> 26:59.283
I'll protect you.

26:59.285 --> 27:02.086
I give you my word.

27:05.357 --> 27:06.690
Mr. Berman...

27:06.692 --> 27:08.292
Listen, until we catch

27:08.294 --> 27:10.828
Your wife's killer,
I think it would be a good idea

27:10.830 --> 27:12.630
For you to stay
at the hotel.

27:12.632 --> 27:14.732
Little extra layer of security.

27:16.334 --> 27:19.169
I don't know what you
want to do about your dog.

27:19.171 --> 27:20.337
Dog?

27:20.339 --> 27:22.272
I don't have a dog.

27:25.410 --> 27:26.944
Stokes:
Where you going, bud?

27:26.946 --> 27:28.412
Come here.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.214
Hey.

27:30.216 --> 27:32.082
Nice pooch, nick.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.651
Thank you.

27:33.653 --> 27:35.219
Nice pooch, nick.
Yeah, thanks.

27:35.221 --> 27:36.820
Hey, so I finally
figured out

27:36.822 --> 27:39.757
How the killer knew his way
around the berman house.

27:39.759 --> 27:41.959
Place was up for
sale a few years ago

27:41.961 --> 27:44.294
And the, uh,
360 virtual walk-through

27:44.296 --> 27:45.829
Is still online.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.931
All the killer had to do
was take the tour

27:47.933 --> 27:49.800
And he knew every inch
of the place.
Scary.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.001
Something that
is supposed to

27:51.003 --> 27:52.736
Help you sell your house
ends up being

27:52.738 --> 27:54.338
A blueprint to kill your wife.
Yeah, he'd

27:54.340 --> 27:56.840
Still have to get past guard
shacks, armed security

27:56.842 --> 28:00.077
And electronic sensor gates.
It's like shawshank over there.

28:00.079 --> 28:03.047
I worked a grand theft
horse case there a while back.

28:03.049 --> 28:05.215
Community's zoned
for four-legged friends.

28:05.217 --> 28:06.350
Residents ride their horses

28:06.352 --> 28:09.086
In and out of there
all the time.

28:09.088 --> 28:12.256
Where there's a horse trail,
there's a dog trail.

28:12.258 --> 28:14.758
Maybe security
thought this guy was
just walking his dog.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.026
That's how he
got past them.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.861
Yeah, and then once onto
the berman property,

28:17.863 --> 28:19.063
He didn't need
the dog anymore,

28:19.065 --> 28:19.997
So he let her loose.

28:19.999 --> 28:22.232
(whines)
that's okay,
sweetie.

28:22.234 --> 28:25.002
Uncle hodges is gonna adopt you
when all this is over.

28:25.004 --> 28:27.371
No, he's not. Uncle greg is.

28:27.373 --> 28:29.773
But I am going
to scan you

28:29.775 --> 28:31.742
With my "arf"-id reader.

28:31.744 --> 28:33.077
(beep)

28:33.079 --> 28:35.045
Shelter dog.

28:35.047 --> 28:37.147
Rescued into a life of crime.

28:37.149 --> 28:39.249
Okay, get a shot of
her for me, will you?

28:39.251 --> 28:41.085
Yeah.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.186
Say cheese, sweetie.

28:42.188 --> 28:44.154
Cheese, sweetie.

28:46.391 --> 28:48.025
Got your text.
What do you got?

28:48.027 --> 28:49.460
Well, this is a first.

28:49.462 --> 28:52.096
Our killer adopted
a death-imminent mongrel dog.

28:52.098 --> 28:54.198
You know, a mutt.
But he made a mistake.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.900
He left a copy of his driver's
license at the dog pound.

28:56.902 --> 28:58.235
The information
is bogus,

28:58.237 --> 29:00.304
But the girl at the
counter I.D.'d the photo.

29:00.306 --> 29:02.005
So I'm looking at our killer.

29:02.007 --> 29:04.108
It gets better.
Nick saw a security camera

29:04.110 --> 29:08.345
In the parking lot of the animal
shelter. We ran the plate.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.180
Rental?
Affirmative.

29:10.182 --> 29:13.117
Time to lojack this jackass.

29:13.119 --> 29:16.920
Control, this is two zero
three charlie, captain brass.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.455
We're at
the lojack-identified site.

29:18.457 --> 29:21.058
Eyes on a silver ford.
Nevada plates. Adam, king,

29:21.060 --> 29:22.493
Sam, henry, four, one, three.

29:24.529 --> 29:27.097
Stokes:
Key's still
in the ignition, jim.

29:30.535 --> 29:32.402
Well, you have evidence.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.171
But no one to tie it to.

29:34.173 --> 29:35.939
He knew that.

29:39.110 --> 29:42.379
That's why he left
it all behind.

29:44.315 --> 29:47.284
Ballistics confirmed
that's the murder weapon.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.253
No prints. No dna.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.221
We tracked down
berman's jeweler.

29:51.223 --> 29:52.456
He's the one who
identified the ring.

29:52.458 --> 29:56.493
Worth over $2 million.
Russell: Great
payday for a killer.

29:56.495 --> 29:57.928
Untraceable.

29:57.930 --> 30:00.164
I also processed
the disposable phone.

30:00.166 --> 30:01.465
There were only
two numbers in memory.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.033
One from an animal shelter

30:03.035 --> 30:05.335
And one from
a rental car agency.

30:05.337 --> 30:07.805
The only thing
probative, really,

30:07.807 --> 30:09.206
Is the video.

30:09.208 --> 30:12.309
Wait, there's a video on
a disposable cell phone?

30:12.311 --> 30:14.044
Oh, yeah.

30:14.046 --> 30:16.180
Play it.

30:29.561 --> 30:30.894
(gunshot)

30:30.896 --> 30:32.362
(woman grunts)

30:32.364 --> 30:34.264
(shrieks)

30:39.404 --> 30:41.004
(gunshot)

30:41.006 --> 30:42.472
(sighs)

30:42.474 --> 30:44.474
You okay?

30:44.476 --> 30:47.377
I missed it.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.214
Hey, slow down,
will you?

30:50.216 --> 30:51.415
What did you miss?

30:51.417 --> 30:53.083
Something on that snuff film?

30:53.085 --> 30:55.185
It's not a snuff film.
It's proof of kill.

30:55.187 --> 30:56.587
Sent by the hit man

30:56.589 --> 30:58.055
To the deep web.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.923
To create a résumé
in cyberspace.

30:59.925 --> 31:01.091
So he gets hired
for future hits.

31:01.093 --> 31:02.559
Wait... (exhales)
you're saying

31:02.561 --> 31:04.862
That the guy who created kitty

31:04.864 --> 31:06.129
Is a hit man?
No.

31:06.131 --> 31:07.197
No, no, no.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.131
The man who created kitty

31:08.133 --> 31:09.533
Is a psycho-sadist.

31:09.535 --> 31:12.202
He derives pleasure from
inflicting pain to others.

31:12.204 --> 31:15.138
He would never tape
himself killing somebody.

31:15.140 --> 31:16.506
He is the one I'm after.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.141
Don't you see?

31:18.143 --> 31:21.345
My psycho-sadist
hired your hit man.

31:21.347 --> 31:23.113
So, your node...

31:23.115 --> 31:25.282
Was never even in vegas.
And that's what I missed.

31:25.284 --> 31:27.651
So, now we're
looking for two ghosts.

31:27.653 --> 31:30.387
Mine is underground, and yours
is halfway around the world.

31:41.165 --> 31:43.333
Brass called interpol.
They put out a worldwide

31:43.335 --> 31:45.102
Broadcast on our hit man.

31:45.104 --> 31:46.436
Hopefully they'll
get a bead on him

31:46.438 --> 31:48.538
So they can drag
his ass back to vegas.

31:48.540 --> 31:51.041
When's the last time you
changed your profile picture?

31:51.043 --> 31:53.143
I don't know, probably after
I shaved my beard off.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.445
Good, you're controlling
your self-image.

31:55.447 --> 31:58.015
So's he. Before nebula1

31:58.017 --> 32:00.951
Was a smiley face,
this is what he looked like.

32:00.953 --> 32:03.120
(laughs)
oh, yeah,

32:03.122 --> 32:06.256
That rates really high
on the creepy meter.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.492
Nebula1-- what's that all about?

32:08.494 --> 32:10.193
Nebula means dark mist.

32:10.195 --> 32:11.361
He thinks he's
beyond our reach.

32:11.363 --> 32:13.196
Tell me, what do you see?

32:13.198 --> 32:15.699
The obvious? Um...

32:15.701 --> 32:18.235
Caucasian male, 20s,
button-up shirt,

32:18.237 --> 32:20.337
Books, family
photos, window,

32:20.339 --> 32:22.606
Blinds.
And from what I can tell,

32:22.608 --> 32:23.941
It's nighttime.

32:23.943 --> 32:25.309
Put it in context.

32:25.311 --> 32:26.443
Barbells

32:26.445 --> 32:28.345
On the floor.
Guy works out.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.180
He's antisocial.
He doesn't like the gym.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.416
Yeah, and he doesn't like
to take out the trash, either.

32:34.252 --> 32:36.420
(short chuckle)
cans are stuffed.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.288
To-go cups,
food containers.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.325
He orders in a lot.
He's agoraphobic.
He doesn't like to leave.

32:41.327 --> 32:42.426
Not even to eat.
Well, we need

32:42.428 --> 32:43.560
To I.D. Him, right?

32:43.562 --> 32:46.263
Guy's got a lot of
family photos there.

32:46.265 --> 32:48.465
If they were his family.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.100
What do you mean?

32:50.102 --> 32:51.702
Blood is thicker
than water, but it's not

32:51.704 --> 32:53.270
Thicker than
a watermark.

32:53.272 --> 32:54.604
Back up the bus.

32:54.606 --> 32:56.440
He downloaded
a fake family?

32:56.442 --> 32:58.108
Everything you see
here is staged.

32:58.110 --> 33:00.510
Family photos communicate
that he's a good person.

33:00.512 --> 33:02.279
Books are supposed
to make us believe

33:02.281 --> 33:04.314
That he's intelligent.
Blinds are closed

33:04.316 --> 33:06.083
So we don't know
where he lives.

33:06.085 --> 33:07.718
Hmm.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.353
Why did you say
it was nighttime?

33:09.355 --> 33:11.054
I don't know.
I mean, I can see

33:11.056 --> 33:13.056
Stars through the blinds.

33:13.058 --> 33:14.224
What, he stage those, too?

33:14.226 --> 33:16.293
No. No. That's an oversight.

33:17.329 --> 33:20.764
It's gestalt theory
of good continuation.

33:25.370 --> 33:27.070
Looks like an arch.

33:27.072 --> 33:28.372
It's the gateway arch.

33:28.374 --> 33:30.107
He's in st. Louis.

33:30.109 --> 33:32.309
I'll triangulate
coordinates.

33:39.350 --> 33:40.717
Clear!

33:42.086 --> 33:44.221
Clear!
Clear? What do you mean,
"clear"?

33:44.223 --> 33:46.089
No suspect on the premises.

33:46.091 --> 33:48.458
Ma'am, you need to see this.

33:50.528 --> 33:53.263
We've got a whole
nerve center here.

33:53.265 --> 33:55.699
Computers, hard drives,
the works.

33:55.701 --> 33:59.069
Stokes:
Oh, looks like he's
still in business, but

33:59.071 --> 34:01.271
If he never leaves the house,
then where is he?

34:01.273 --> 34:02.439
Give me the ceiling.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.141
All four corners.

34:09.547 --> 34:10.547
He's got a web cam!

34:10.549 --> 34:12.215
He's watching us! It's a trap!

34:12.217 --> 34:13.216
Get out! Extract! Extract!

34:13.218 --> 34:15.052
Go! Go! Everybody out! Go!

34:15.054 --> 34:17.454
(shouting, explosion)

34:17.456 --> 34:19.322
(static)

34:19.324 --> 34:21.391
(sighs)

34:27.298 --> 34:29.566
Figured I'd find you out here.

34:34.539 --> 34:38.141
Hey, you saved all
those men's lives today.

34:38.143 --> 34:41.344
Unfortunately, the evidence
didn't fair so well.

34:41.346 --> 34:43.747
We lost dna, prints.

34:43.749 --> 34:46.550
All the hardware
was incinerated.

34:48.653 --> 34:52.289
Oh. Is that right, d.B.?

34:52.291 --> 34:54.324
Well, yes, avery, it is.

34:54.326 --> 34:57.494
I found a photo

34:57.496 --> 34:59.629
Of susan's house on her phone.

34:59.631 --> 35:02.532
She never posted it
to friend agenda.

35:02.534 --> 35:05.168
If I upload it,
he'll know where she lives.

35:05.170 --> 35:06.603
You're thinking
of putting her in play?

35:06.605 --> 35:08.472
I applied some pressure.

35:08.474 --> 35:11.441
I got an agoraphobe
to leave his house.

35:11.443 --> 35:13.443
We could lure him.

35:13.445 --> 35:16.413
He is moveable.

35:16.415 --> 35:18.415
And now you want
to move him again

35:18.417 --> 35:20.183
And use susan to do it.

35:20.185 --> 35:21.451
(ryan sighs)

35:21.453 --> 35:23.587
But you're on the fence
about it?

35:23.589 --> 35:25.388
The internet
amplifies crime.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.290
If my node gets
away with this,

35:27.292 --> 35:29.459
His cyber cred
will be immortalized.

35:29.461 --> 35:33.263
He will spawn hundreds, if not
thousands, of copycatters.

35:33.265 --> 35:36.366
So, it's susan
versus the greater good.

35:36.368 --> 35:39.503
I looked that woman in the eye,

35:39.505 --> 35:41.505
And I promised her

35:41.507 --> 35:43.507
I would protect her.

35:43.509 --> 35:47.244
We are talking about a woman
and two little girls.

35:49.413 --> 35:51.481
Do you want my opinion?

35:56.354 --> 35:59.456
Greater good.
Put her in play.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.525
I've got you covered.

36:10.535 --> 36:14.504
(camera shutters clicking)
my name is susan mcdowell.

36:15.806 --> 36:19.509
My husband's a marine
proudly serving in afghanistan.

36:19.511 --> 36:23.246
I am a mother of two girls.

36:23.248 --> 36:27.384
I thought I was tough,
that I could handle anything.

36:27.386 --> 36:29.686
Then someone hacked
into my life,

36:29.688 --> 36:32.389
Hijacked all my photos online,

36:32.391 --> 36:33.690
Used my likeness,

36:33.692 --> 36:36.326
My face, my body,

36:36.328 --> 36:40.397
Put me on the internet,
where I was virtually raped

36:40.399 --> 36:42.832
By thousands of men.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.868
There is no law against
what this man did to me.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.937
There is no law against
what this man did to me.

36:46.939 --> 36:49.306
But I was violated.

36:49.308 --> 36:50.440
Virtual rape...

36:50.442 --> 36:51.875
Is rape.
Susan:
...Is rape.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.810
And I refuse
to stand back and do nothing.

36:53.812 --> 36:55.812
And I refuse to stand by
and do nothing.

36:58.783 --> 37:01.551
Susan, you can do this.

37:01.553 --> 37:03.553
The difference

37:03.555 --> 37:06.323
Between a victim
and victory is action.

37:06.325 --> 37:08.525
Take back your life.

37:08.527 --> 37:11.528
Provoke him,
expose him for what he is.

37:12.863 --> 37:14.864
You see this?

37:14.866 --> 37:17.667
This is what he turned me into.

37:17.669 --> 37:20.270
A whore, a prostitute.

37:20.272 --> 37:21.805
He's selling my body

37:21.807 --> 37:23.506
To thousands of men

37:23.508 --> 37:25.709
Around the world 24/7.

37:25.711 --> 37:28.311
As of today,
I'm shutting you down.

37:28.313 --> 37:31.381
And so here's my message
to all you men out there.

37:31.383 --> 37:34.284
Log off and check
into your families.

37:34.286 --> 37:36.019
Don't let this coward win.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.454
(ryan laughs)

37:37.456 --> 37:39.623
(whooping)

37:39.625 --> 37:40.924
Ryan:
Well done, susan.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.559
Clikk:
Agent ryan, I've been tracking

37:42.561 --> 37:44.628
Nebula1's activity
on friend agenda

37:44.630 --> 37:46.763
Since you announced
her press conference.

37:46.765 --> 37:50.700
In the last hour, he's peeped
her page 900,000 times.

37:50.702 --> 37:52.602
He d.O.S.'d her?

37:52.604 --> 37:54.904
He's so angry,
he crashed her site.

37:54.906 --> 37:57.941
You wanted obsession.
You got it.

37:59.644 --> 38:01.611
We're going to san diego.

38:16.661 --> 38:19.029
♪

38:36.047 --> 38:38.748
You're a cop.

38:40.518 --> 38:43.053
You're a sadist.

38:43.055 --> 38:45.055
Where's kitty?

38:45.057 --> 38:46.623
You mean susan?

38:46.625 --> 38:48.558
You're confused.

38:48.560 --> 38:51.695
Susan is real, kitty is not.

38:51.697 --> 38:53.697
I created kitty.

38:53.699 --> 38:55.699
I made her.

38:55.701 --> 38:58.001
I'm not gonna ask you again.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.507
Is that a .45?

39:06.644 --> 39:08.645
(sniffing)

39:08.647 --> 39:10.914
I guarantee you
it's never been fired.

39:12.583 --> 39:16.419
I've had bigger guns pointed
at my face.

39:16.421 --> 39:18.855
Wait till you see my other gun.

39:18.857 --> 39:20.523
I saw it.

39:20.525 --> 39:22.959
The one your hit man used
to kill audrey berman?

39:22.961 --> 39:25.628
I thought
I'd do this one myself.

39:25.630 --> 39:28.465
I thought you'd be
more of a blade man.

39:38.142 --> 39:40.443
She just got him to trade down.

39:40.445 --> 39:42.479
How long are we gonna play
this waiting game?

39:42.481 --> 39:44.748
We wait for agent
ryan's code word.

39:50.388 --> 39:53.390
You going to cut me?

40:02.700 --> 40:04.768
You like to watch me bleed?

40:04.770 --> 40:07.670
Yeah.

40:09.039 --> 40:10.774
You want me to cut you again?

40:10.776 --> 40:12.142
Are you hearing that?

40:12.144 --> 40:15.044
Yeah. She's adding
years to his sentence.
Oh.

40:15.046 --> 40:17.580
Tell me about the first time.

40:17.582 --> 40:20.884
I was eight years old...

40:20.886 --> 40:23.153
And I cut my sister's breasts

40:23.155 --> 40:25.422
With a straight razor.

40:26.690 --> 40:28.792
I got no problem
cutting you.

40:30.995 --> 40:33.163
Well, I do.

40:33.165 --> 40:34.197
I'm out of here.

40:34.199 --> 40:36.966
You're not going anywhere!

40:38.202 --> 40:40.737
Have you ever
been murdered before?

40:42.206 --> 40:44.774
Mushroom.

40:48.012 --> 40:49.746
(explosive rumbling)

40:51.649 --> 40:52.649
(grunts)

40:52.651 --> 40:54.517
Drop it!

40:54.519 --> 40:56.686
Drop it! Drop it!

40:57.755 --> 40:59.656
Stay down!

40:59.658 --> 41:01.624
Stay down!
You're under arrest

41:01.626 --> 41:04.227
For attempted murder
of a federal agent,

41:04.229 --> 41:05.795
Conspiracy to commit murder,

41:05.797 --> 41:08.865
Extortion and a thousand counts
of being a creep.

41:08.867 --> 41:11.701
Say bye-bye to your wi-fi.

41:11.703 --> 41:13.136
(grunting)

41:13.138 --> 41:14.737
You all right?

41:16.474 --> 41:19.509
I'll feel a lot better when you
get our hit man behind bars.

41:19.511 --> 41:20.777
You're something else.

41:20.779 --> 41:21.744
(laughs)

41:21.746 --> 41:23.880
Oh, my god.

41:26.116 --> 41:28.518
Susan:
Thank you so much for
bringing us down here.

41:28.520 --> 41:29.752
The girls are
so excited.

41:29.754 --> 41:31.120
(laughing)

41:31.122 --> 41:33.656
They want to be pilots
just like their dad.

41:34.892 --> 41:36.159
Girls!

41:36.161 --> 41:37.160
(gasps)

41:37.162 --> 41:38.628
Both:
Daddy!

41:38.630 --> 41:40.497
Both:
Daddy!
(laughs)

41:42.233 --> 41:44.234
You brought my husband home?

41:44.236 --> 41:45.935
After all you've been through,
you both deserve

41:45.937 --> 41:47.804
A hero's welcome.

41:49.974 --> 41:51.708
Thank you.

41:53.744 --> 41:56.646
(ryan laughs)

41:56.648 --> 41:57.847
(laughs)

41:57.849 --> 41:59.282
(laughs)
that was nice.

41:59.284 --> 42:02.285
So, this is good-bye,
I guess, huh?

42:02.287 --> 42:04.721
Well, for now.

42:04.723 --> 42:06.022
Where you off to?

42:06.024 --> 42:07.857
Oh, bank robbery, pittsburgh.

42:07.859 --> 42:10.760
How much?
Three cents.

42:10.762 --> 42:12.829
Oh, give me a break.
Talk to me. How much?

42:12.831 --> 42:14.230
Three copper pennies...

42:14.232 --> 42:15.698
From 80 million
checking accounts.

42:15.700 --> 42:17.800
$2.4 million a week.

42:17.802 --> 42:19.569
Makes for one hell of a heist.

42:19.571 --> 42:21.204
Check your bank statements.
No kidding.

42:21.206 --> 42:23.773
And they say there's no
such thing as the perfect crime.

42:23.775 --> 42:26.242
It's not the perfect crime.

42:26.244 --> 42:28.778
It's cyber crime.
