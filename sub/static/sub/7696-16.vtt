WEBVTT

02:47.667 --> 02:50.294
You can't do this.

02:50.544 --> 02:52.713
I've seen what you've done
to the others.

02:52.797 --> 02:56.425
Please let me go. I'll pay anything.

02:56.801 --> 02:58.886
You've done enough damage
with your money.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.097
You wicked, evil...

03:01.347 --> 03:02.848
Evil, Mrs. Thomas?

03:03.265 --> 03:04.725
I don't control a company

03:04.809 --> 03:07.978
that leveled a 1,000-year-old forest
for a strip mine.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.647
That's evil.

03:24.245 --> 03:27.498
You and your kind owe Mother Nature
a big debt,

03:27.707 --> 03:31.043
and I'm going to see that you pay it.

03:39.927 --> 03:42.096
I don't care
how much money we'll lose.

03:42.221 --> 03:44.223
I won't have Wayne Enterprises involved

03:44.306 --> 03:47.143
in an operation
that destroys a rainforest.

03:47.226 --> 03:49.186
Shut it down or you're gone!

03:49.979 --> 03:51.689
One of my greedy directors made a deal

03:51.772 --> 03:53.983
with a slash-and-burn outfit
in the Amazon.

03:54.191 --> 03:56.152
Hmm, it's fortunate
you caught it in time.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.863
I hate it when things slip by me.

03:59.321 --> 04:01.699
And with me helping you
to answer your mail,

04:01.782 --> 04:02.783
nothing will.

04:04.744 --> 04:07.413
Ah, it says here
you just won $10 million.

04:07.496 --> 04:08.497
That's nice.

04:08.789 --> 04:13.502
Hmm, you also received a tape from
some enterprise called Eternal Youth.

04:13.586 --> 04:14.587
Shall I have a look?

04:15.796 --> 04:16.964
Be my guest.

04:28.684 --> 04:31.103
<i>Hello, Mr. Wayne, I'm Violet.</i>

04:31.395 --> 04:32.897
<i>And I'm Lily.</i>

04:33.105 --> 04:35.441
<i>And we'd like to invite you...</i>

04:35.524 --> 04:37.526
<i>To a free weekend at...</i>

04:37.902 --> 04:40.029
<i>- The Eternal Youth Spa.
- The Eternal Youth Spa.</i>

04:42.490 --> 04:44.700
Oh, my. They even speak in unison.

05:10.351 --> 05:11.393
Maggie.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.270
Hello, love.

05:16.315 --> 05:18.901
Care to join me for a morning jog?

05:21.737 --> 05:25.616
As much as I'd love to,
Master Bruce insists I review this tape.

05:28.786 --> 05:30.287
"Eternal Youth."

05:30.663 --> 05:32.164
Sounds intriguing.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.710
- Hello, Bruce.
- Good morning, Maggie.

05:38.587 --> 05:42.216
<i>Our founder, Dr. Daphne Demeter,</i>

05:42.299 --> 05:44.760
<i>has created a medical program</i>

05:44.969 --> 05:47.388
<i>-that actually reverses</i>
- My, <i>my, my.</i>

05:47.471 --> 05:49.139
<i>the aging process.</i>

05:49.223 --> 05:50.975
My gracious.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.227
Everyone's got a gimmick.

05:53.811 --> 05:57.523
<i>You'll enjoy a weekend
of sumptuous mineral baths,</i>

05:57.898 --> 05:59.984
<i>specially prepared meals,</i>

06:00.276 --> 06:02.486
<i>and invigorating nature hikes.</i>

06:02.653 --> 06:05.155
<i>In two days, you'll look...</i>

06:05.656 --> 06:06.907
<i>And feel...</i>

06:07.199 --> 06:09.118
<i>- Years younger!
- Years younger!</i>

06:09.660 --> 06:11.579
<i>It's the perfect weekend</i>

06:11.912 --> 06:15.040
<i>for the harried, stressed-out executive.</i>

06:15.583 --> 06:18.711
You might wanna try this, Bruce,
with your late nights and all.

06:19.086 --> 06:20.629
My weekends are shot, Maggie.

06:21.088 --> 06:22.840
But if you and Alfred would like
to go in my place...

06:23.090 --> 06:24.091
Uh...

06:25.217 --> 06:27.344
Thank you, sir,
but we couldn't possibly accept.

06:27.761 --> 06:29.388
It's much too generous.

06:30.681 --> 06:32.141
I thought they said it was free.

06:32.766 --> 06:36.478
They did. Oh, Alfie,
don't be an old fogy.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.856
A little fresh air would do us both
some good.

06:39.106 --> 06:41.525
And you have been promising
to take me somewhere.

06:43.027 --> 06:44.612
I'm afraid
it's quite out of the question.

06:46.614 --> 06:47.907
I've been shanghaied.

06:48.032 --> 06:49.366
Oh, hush.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.036
Maggie!

07:05.257 --> 07:06.508
<i>May I help you?</i>

07:06.592 --> 07:08.636
Hello. I'm Ms. Page.

07:08.719 --> 07:09.970
And this is Mr. Pennyworth.

07:10.346 --> 07:12.264
<i>We'll be filling in for Mr. Wayne.</i>

07:13.599 --> 07:15.643
Our target is a no-show.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.269
What should we do?

07:17.937 --> 07:19.104
Let them in.

07:19.396 --> 07:22.900
Somebody's got to pay
for the sins of Wayne Enterprises.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.615
Good morning.
I am your director, Dr. Demeter,

07:30.366 --> 07:31.659
and I welcome you

07:31.992 --> 07:35.871
to our wonderful program
of organic rejuvenation.

07:44.505 --> 07:47.466
Would you put that thing down and relax?

07:47.758 --> 07:50.052
After years of research in my lab,

07:50.219 --> 07:53.138
I have developed this enzyme. Demetrite.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.598
The secret of eternal youth.

07:55.182 --> 07:57.559
Doesn't she look wonderful?

07:57.851 --> 07:59.228
Not a day over 90.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.981
Here you'll find demetrite in the food,

08:02.064 --> 08:03.107
the water,

08:03.190 --> 08:04.942
even the air you breathe at night.

08:05.192 --> 08:06.986
What a relaxing thought.

08:09.947 --> 08:11.073
I assure you,

08:11.240 --> 08:15.244
the enzyme is thoroughly non-toxic
and completely biodegradable.

08:15.452 --> 08:19.081
And once you see
those wrinkles melt away,

08:19.164 --> 08:22.167
you'll want to saturate
every cell with it.

08:23.210 --> 08:25.337
To eternal youth.

08:25.796 --> 08:27.631
- To eternal youth.
- To eternal youth.

08:37.766 --> 08:40.060
Mmm. Quite refreshing, actually.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.021
You should taste these.

08:42.312 --> 08:43.522
Delicious.

08:47.359 --> 08:51.739
Now, this is the kind of
wilderness experience I could enjoy.

08:57.286 --> 08:59.204
It's a real brain-buster,
my friend.

09:01.123 --> 09:03.584
No ransom note, no goodbye note,
no nothing.

09:04.126 --> 09:06.462
And she's not the only
vanishing industrialist.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.380
Three more were reported this week.

09:09.214 --> 09:10.674
I'II search her penthouse.

09:11.133 --> 09:12.217
Good luck.

09:12.634 --> 09:14.303
We put that place under a microscope.

09:14.386 --> 09:15.971
And all we got was eye strain.

09:16.305 --> 09:18.390
Maybe your Bat radar can...

09:22.811 --> 09:24.104
Oh, never mind.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.215
<i>Hello, Mrs. Thomas,</i>

09:51.298 --> 09:52.716
<i>I'm Violet.</i>

09:52.800 --> 09:54.134
<i>And I'm Lily.</i>

09:54.551 --> 09:56.845
<i>And we'd like to invite you...</i>

09:56.929 --> 09:59.223
<i>To a free weekend at...</i>

09:59.306 --> 10:01.600
<i>The Eternal Youth Spa.</i>

10:04.770 --> 10:06.188
Yes, Master Bruce,

10:06.271 --> 10:09.191
I did ask about that lady
as you requested.

10:09.483 --> 10:12.986
But it seems she left by herself
two weekends ago.

10:13.654 --> 10:16.907
<i>Why anyone would want
to leave this place is beyond me.</i>

10:18.575 --> 10:20.160
Alfred, are you okay?

10:20.536 --> 10:22.037
Never better, sir.

10:22.204 --> 10:25.707
Everywhere I turn,
I see another sign of nature's...

10:27.334 --> 10:28.544
Beauty.

10:28.961 --> 10:32.923
I assure you that when I return,
I'll be feeling like a new man.

10:43.600 --> 10:47.646
You know, Maggie, I never realized
how dreary this place actually looks.

10:47.729 --> 10:49.648
Especially after where we've been.

10:49.731 --> 10:50.732
Ah, well,

10:50.899 --> 10:52.818
thanks for a splendid weekend.

10:57.739 --> 10:58.991
Oh.

11:01.702 --> 11:04.788
You are feeling younger,
aren't you?

11:26.101 --> 11:27.311
What the...

11:37.070 --> 11:38.447
Good to see you, sir.

11:39.114 --> 11:40.574
You too, Alfred.

11:40.991 --> 11:42.159
What's with the jungle?

11:42.242 --> 11:45.370
Oh, I thought this drab old cave
could use a little color.

11:45.787 --> 11:46.788
How does it look?

11:48.207 --> 11:49.333
Green.

11:49.416 --> 11:52.502
Yes, so lovely.

11:54.296 --> 11:57.633
I fear all this decorating has given me
a dreadful thirst.

11:59.635 --> 12:00.761
What's that?

12:01.094 --> 12:03.222
Special spa water, sir,

12:03.555 --> 12:06.141
with a drop or two
of Dr. Demeter's formula.

12:06.516 --> 12:08.810
Wonderful stuff, this demetrite.

12:15.067 --> 12:19.446
Ah. Excuse me, sir.
I couldn't help myself...

12:21.782 --> 12:22.783
Alfred!

12:24.785 --> 12:25.786
Really, sir.

12:25.869 --> 12:28.121
It was merely a case of overexertion.

12:28.538 --> 12:32.042
My weekend must have been
more tiring than I realized.

12:32.584 --> 12:34.920
Well, you get some rest.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.005
I need to check on something.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.294
Maggie.

13:15.919 --> 13:17.462
How strange to see you.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.006
I've just been thinking about-

13:19.089 --> 13:20.966
Going back to the spa?

13:21.049 --> 13:22.217
How did you know?

13:22.676 --> 13:25.345
That's all I've been thinking about
since I got home.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.307
Computer log continuing.

13:28.390 --> 13:30.517
The active ingredient
in the demetrite formula

13:30.600 --> 13:32.602
is a chlorophyll-based enzyme.

13:32.728 --> 13:36.440
Analysis indicates that it does affect
human cellular membranes.

13:37.566 --> 13:41.153
I am now combining equal amounts
of the enzyme

13:41.236 --> 13:42.446
to human plasma.

13:46.533 --> 13:47.534
What the...

13:53.874 --> 13:54.875
Alfred!

13:55.792 --> 13:56.918
Alfred!

14:00.130 --> 14:01.256
Alfred!

14:02.049 --> 14:03.800
Alfred!

14:04.760 --> 14:06.011
I don't know why, Doctor,

14:06.094 --> 14:09.890
but we felt absolutely compelled
to come back.

14:09.973 --> 14:11.808
We couldn't keep ourselves away.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.018
Hmm.

14:13.101 --> 14:17.189
Already your bodies have been primed
for the true value of my treatment.

14:17.522 --> 14:19.566
The ultimate rejuvenation,

14:19.858 --> 14:23.111
the promise of life everlasting.

14:30.369 --> 14:31.828
I say, what is this?

14:36.166 --> 14:37.501
Run, Maggie!

15:41.231 --> 15:43.400
You go after the wrong people, Batman.

15:46.653 --> 15:47.904
Poison Ivy.

15:48.572 --> 15:50.907
Only you would identify yourself
with Demeter,

15:50.991 --> 15:52.409
the Greek goddess of plants.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.703
Hey, a high school graduate.

16:00.750 --> 16:02.085
Don't even think about it.

16:06.339 --> 16:08.175
Unusual trees.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.805
<i>Subtropica brasilias.</i>

16:14.181 --> 16:16.892
As rare as winter roses, Batman.

16:22.647 --> 16:25.108
I tap their sap for my growth enzyme,

16:25.650 --> 16:30.489
which you see here
in its purified, most concentrated form.

16:30.697 --> 16:32.407
The secret of eternal youth.

16:35.827 --> 16:38.997
But you haven't seen
my most intriguing trees.

16:39.706 --> 16:43.460
Actually, Batman,
you and I are surprisingly alike.

16:45.670 --> 16:49.049
We both strive
to see evil-doers punished.

16:52.719 --> 16:55.597
But while you have your gallery
of rogues,

16:56.556 --> 16:58.767
I have my grove.

17:09.986 --> 17:11.988
This can't be.

17:12.614 --> 17:14.366
This dog of a dogwood

17:14.449 --> 17:17.452
leveled enough trees
to shade a small state.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.583
And weep not for this willow.

17:23.875 --> 17:27.128
She slaughtered an ancient forest
to produce cardboard.

17:27.587 --> 17:28.713
Cardboard!

17:30.840 --> 17:33.510
Of course, I still owe Bruce Wayne
for his involvement

17:33.593 --> 17:35.053
with that slash-and-burn outfit.

17:35.971 --> 17:37.097
But for now,

17:37.222 --> 17:39.808
I'm content to settle for his friends.

17:53.989 --> 17:56.741
Right now,
the bark is merely exoskeletal.

17:57.075 --> 17:59.244
It will take months
of additional spraying

17:59.327 --> 18:02.372
before the transformations
become irreversible.

18:02.789 --> 18:06.668
But, of course,
I have the patience of a redwood.

18:07.043 --> 18:10.380
And the convictions of a fanatic.

18:10.714 --> 18:13.341
Well, if you're not going
to be part of the solution,

18:13.466 --> 18:15.135
you're obviously part of the problem.

18:15.218 --> 18:16.219
Ladies.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.063
This spray is triple-strength, Batman.

18:27.647 --> 18:30.817
It will start the transformation
without any preliminaries.

18:38.575 --> 18:40.410
He should be sprouting leaves by now.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.582
You made your secret
too accessible, Ivy.

18:45.665 --> 18:48.084
I coated my outfit
with an herbicidal antidote.

18:48.585 --> 18:49.961
Keep spraying!

19:03.642 --> 19:05.602
Huh?

19:41.388 --> 19:43.973
And I thought
you believed in justice.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.558
Justice, yes.

19:45.850 --> 19:48.061
But not the vengeance
of an eco-terrorist.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.314
You're as destructive
as those you punish.

19:58.196 --> 20:01.825
Look what you've made me do
to my poor, defenseless tree.

20:12.127 --> 20:13.378
The enzyme!

21:12.812 --> 21:14.105
Alfie,

21:14.272 --> 21:16.399
do you realize
that this is the second place

21:16.483 --> 21:18.276
we've been together in as many weeks?

21:18.985 --> 21:21.571
This relationship is branching out.

21:21.863 --> 21:22.864
Please, Maggie.

21:23.531 --> 21:26.451
After our encounter with Joan of Bark,

21:26.534 --> 21:29.329
the last thing I want
to be reminded of is trees.

21:29.704 --> 21:30.955
Hey, good news.

21:31.331 --> 21:34.167
I just heard all of Poison Ivy's victims
are expected to recover.

21:34.667 --> 21:36.461
Bruce, please.

21:36.544 --> 21:38.797
The plant. Must you?

21:39.881 --> 21:40.965
Oh.

21:41.591 --> 21:43.176
Maybe I'd better leave this outside.

21:43.551 --> 21:47.180
Nice man, but sometimes not too bright.

22:22.173 --> 22:23.174
English - SDH
