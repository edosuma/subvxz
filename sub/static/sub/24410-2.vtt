00:03.640 --> 00:04.680
Hi, Mischa.

00:04.760 --> 00:09.120
You've got connections
on Åland, right?

00:09.200 --> 00:13.800
All you have to do is get on the
boat, meet me out on the water,

00:13.880 --> 00:16.640
and sit on the goods for a while.

00:16.720 --> 00:19.320
I descended
from Heaven to join the people,

00:19.400 --> 00:23.320
to teach them to love their neighbour
as they do themselves.

00:23.880 --> 00:26.680
<i>For if they do not,</i>
<i>no safe haven can exist,</i>

00:26.760 --> 00:29.440
<i>in Heaven or on Earth.</i>

00:29.520 --> 00:32.200
<i>What's going on? Where is Liv?</i>

00:32.280 --> 00:34.640
She left me.

00:37.880 --> 00:39.400
Hi, Jonna!

00:43.080 --> 00:45.680
We should get outdoor hot tubs.

00:45.760 --> 00:50.320
Yes, for the guests
to have a drink in at night.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.480
Mischa!

01:41.920 --> 01:43.280
What the hell?

02:37.360 --> 02:41.920
Everything Lasse touches
catches fire. It's like magic.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.280
-What?
-Nothing.

02:47.440 --> 02:51.040
-He might spontaneously combust.
-That's enough.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.320
I was only joking.

05:22.320 --> 05:25.440
THICKER THAN WATER

06:11.000 --> 06:16.080
Jesus... The guests can either have
hot food or a dry bed to sleep in.

06:16.600 --> 06:18.760
What do you reckon they'll choose?

06:18.840 --> 06:21.760
We'll just have to make sure
they get both.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.480
"Just"?

06:51.000 --> 06:54.600
-We'll never get this done in time.
-Of course we will.

06:54.680 --> 06:59.760
-Don't be negative. It'll work out.
-Work out? How?

06:59.840 --> 07:03.920
It just will somehow!
Don't be such a pessimist.

07:17.200 --> 07:20.520
-Hello, Jorma.
-Took you long enough.

07:21.200 --> 07:25.480
I've been busy.
There was a storm, you know.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.000
It's in here.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.280
Right...

07:32.600 --> 07:35.520
Nothing missing except for a coat?

07:35.600 --> 07:37.120
And a blanket.

07:38.200 --> 07:42.840
-Valuables? The gun safe?
-No, nothing.

07:42.920 --> 07:46.160
Oh, there was one other thing. Here.

07:50.280 --> 07:55.760
Maybe someone mistook the place
for a hospital. What happens next?

07:56.200 --> 07:58.040
I'll report it.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.200
And the coat and the blanket?

08:01.280 --> 08:03.280
Don't get your hopes up.

08:04.280 --> 08:07.160
Who will reimburse me for the window?

08:07.240 --> 08:11.720
Not the police, as you well know.
Ask your insurance company.

08:11.800 --> 08:15.000
I'll report it.
That's all I can do for now.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.120
Take care!

08:43.680 --> 08:45.400
Did you sleep all right?

08:46.200 --> 08:47.160
Sure.

08:47.880 --> 08:52.120
-And are you all right?
-I'm fine.

08:53.720 --> 08:57.000
I can't help but wonder
whose boat that was.

09:00.200 --> 09:03.960
There's a fine line
between courage and stupidity.

09:06.440 --> 09:11.480
-So you didn't sleep well.
-You could've died out in that wind.

09:11.560 --> 09:15.200
-And the explosion...
-But I'm fine. Let's get this done.

09:15.280 --> 09:19.640
Did you see the state of the house?
We'll have to cancel the dinners.

09:19.720 --> 09:23.400
-We'll just hire someone to fix it.
-But that costs...

09:25.400 --> 09:28.960
-What's he doing here?
-Quiet, Hieronymus.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.480
Lost, Konrad?

09:32.560 --> 09:36.240
I wanted to make sure
the storm hadn't blown you away.

09:36.320 --> 09:38.600
We're still here, as you can see.

09:38.680 --> 09:42.720
Yes. Like a rash
that won't stop itching.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.720
-Did you suffer any damage?
-No.

09:45.800 --> 09:50.400
It was worse in '85.
The forest looked like a Mikado set.

09:50.480 --> 09:53.600
That was a storm.
This was a light breeze.

09:53.680 --> 09:59.040
-As you can see, we're quite busy.
-Your house looks awful.

09:59.120 --> 10:01.640
Those repairs won't come cheap.

10:02.320 --> 10:04.640
All right. Come on.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.000
Hope your insurance covers it!

10:10.080 --> 10:12.280
Thanks for stopping by!

10:14.600 --> 10:19.920
-What's wrong?
-Nothing, I just have stuff to do.

10:35.480 --> 10:38.200
Got a leaky ceiling
in room 202 as well.

10:38.920 --> 10:41.200
Why was Konrad here?
Does he come often?

10:41.280 --> 10:43.800
Sometimes, when he's drunk.

10:43.880 --> 10:46.520
-Going on about Dad?
-Right.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.760
-Does he know?
-What?

10:51.280 --> 10:53.760
No! Are you crazy?

10:57.640 --> 11:00.520
I can't find anything
with all this stuff everywhere!

11:00.600 --> 11:03.040
-What are you looking for?
-The insurance.

11:03.720 --> 11:06.240
We do have insurance, right?

11:06.320 --> 11:11.440
Liv took care of all that.
She had some kind of system.

11:11.520 --> 11:16.520
-A system?
-Yes, a system, with binders!

11:24.200 --> 11:27.960
Could it be this one,
marked "Contracts and insurance"?

11:31.480 --> 11:33.440
Here it is!

11:35.080 --> 11:36.600
Right...

11:40.120 --> 11:41.720
No!

11:45.680 --> 11:48.760
-It was due in September.
-But Liv...

11:48.840 --> 11:55.280
Don't blame it on Liv! You're
a grown man, accept responsibility!

11:55.360 --> 11:58.560
Stop blaming others for everything.

12:01.720 --> 12:04.760
-Now what?
-I'm all right, it's just...

12:05.440 --> 12:07.560
There's no air in here.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.200
Listen...

12:15.160 --> 12:17.840
There. It's all right.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.400
Hello?

12:27.480 --> 12:30.080
Yes, this is Waldemar's.

12:30.880 --> 12:33.240
Right, yes.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.600
It was absolutely terrible.

12:36.280 --> 12:39.600
We are open
for Christmas dinners as usual.

12:40.200 --> 12:43.760
The book. Give me the book!

12:44.440 --> 12:47.120
Let's see, just a second.

12:47.720 --> 12:53.160
For how many? Ten? Under what...

12:53.240 --> 12:56.560
On Saturday? Yes, great!

12:56.640 --> 12:59.960
We'll see you Saturday at 7.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.320
Lovely. Thank you.

13:03.560 --> 13:07.280
Just because the phone works
doesn't mean we should...

13:07.360 --> 13:10.280
Everything will be all right.
Come on.

13:10.360 --> 13:13.280
You start calling contractors.
I'll deal with this.

13:13.360 --> 13:18.000
And call the police about that boat
while you're at it.

13:18.080 --> 13:21.000
-Lasse can do that.
-"Lasse can do that."

13:21.600 --> 13:24.840
-Very mature.
-Exactly. Call them!

13:26.480 --> 13:27.440
<i>Hi, Mange.</i>

13:29.880 --> 13:35.080
Yes, it's been forever.
No, I'll be all right. No worries.

13:35.160 --> 13:38.760
I'm done with the restaurant now.

13:39.520 --> 13:44.920
Right, right...
Listen, I have something to ask you.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.320
You know Mischa? Right, him.

13:51.360 --> 13:54.840
You haven't? That long?

13:55.560 --> 14:01.080
I just had him in mind for something,
and I only had his old number.

14:01.160 --> 14:03.840
I was just wondering...

14:04.320 --> 14:06.280
All right. Bye.

14:18.600 --> 14:22.800
And there's nobody else?
Right, the storm. Thanks.

14:26.080 --> 14:31.280
-How's it going?
-Absolutely great.

14:31.360 --> 14:35.800
There's no contractors available
until January, if we're lucky.

14:35.880 --> 14:41.280
-Keep making calls.
-Where to? Turku? Helsinki?

14:41.360 --> 14:43.960
Maybe there's one in Stockholm.

14:44.720 --> 14:47.880
-Where are you going?
-To deal with it myself.

14:56.280 --> 14:58.720
No, sorry. There's nobody.

14:58.800 --> 15:02.240
-Do you always need all your people?
-I'm afraid so.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.880
Couldn't you just see if...

15:10.360 --> 15:12.680
-Jonna?
-Hi!

15:14.400 --> 15:18.840
-When did you get to Åland?
-A couple of days ago for Christmas.

15:18.920 --> 15:24.280
-What are you doing here?
-My architect firm is building here.

15:24.360 --> 15:30.520
-So you finished the film? Or play?
-A film. Yes, it's finished.

15:31.960 --> 15:34.960
It's a bit chaotic.
We need help to fix the roof.

15:35.400 --> 15:40.320
I don't know what it is, so we need
a professional. It's impossible.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.360
Nothing is impossible.

15:42.960 --> 15:47.960
Go here, and tell him I sent you.
I'm sure he has someone to spare.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.960
I'll phone you. Thanks! See you.

16:02.760 --> 16:04.560
Hello!

16:05.080 --> 16:06.720
You were right.

16:07.800 --> 16:12.840
Yeah, the storm wreaked havoc.
All kinds of debris is washing up.

16:12.920 --> 16:15.600
Won't be cleared up until spring.

16:15.680 --> 16:17.960
-The house is still standing.
-Only just.

16:18.040 --> 16:22.400
No partner today, I see.
Isn't that dangerous?

16:23.520 --> 16:24.920
I'll take the risk.

16:25.640 --> 16:30.280
We got reports about a flare
going off out here last night.

16:31.400 --> 16:34.200
Supposedly around here. See anything?

16:35.280 --> 16:36.360
Excuse me.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.880
-Sorry?
-Did you see a flare?

16:44.960 --> 16:47.720
Yes, out on the water.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.480
We tried to phone for help,
but the lines were down.

16:52.240 --> 16:55.160
Did you see the boat
that might have fired it?

16:56.440 --> 17:00.520
I took our boat out
to see where it came from, but...

17:00.600 --> 17:03.200
-Out on the water?
-Yes.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.480
Hang on. 3426.

17:05.560 --> 17:08.960
<i>The coast guard</i>
<i>needs you to go with them.</i>

17:09.040 --> 17:11.000
Send me the address.

17:11.760 --> 17:17.760
-I have to go. I'll be back.
-Sure. Drive safe!

18:05.800 --> 18:08.240
1 NEW MESSAGE

18:08.320 --> 18:11.680
I need to see you. Can I come over?

18:15.280 --> 18:21.440
Not right now. Things are crazy here.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.320
Hi, Dad. I'm busy right now.
Can I call you back?

18:36.880 --> 18:40.960
-I just had a quick...
<i>-Okay, make it fast.</i>

18:46.080 --> 18:49.840
Dad? You haven't heard from her yet?

18:49.920 --> 18:54.640
Could you just... Just tell...

18:56.760 --> 19:01.200
-Never mind.
-Don't worry. She seems okay.

19:01.280 --> 19:04.200
<i>All right, I'm glad to hear that.</i>

19:04.280 --> 19:08.960
-I have to go. Okay?
<i>-Sure. Bye, darling.</i>

19:32.960 --> 19:38.160
Don't worry, Dad. Mum is all right!

20:12.880 --> 20:16.320
-Hi! I'm looking for Tobbe.
-That's me.

20:16.400 --> 20:21.280
Mikael Rosén recommended you and
thought you might have someone free.

20:21.360 --> 20:26.360
Doesn't matter if the Pope himself
recommended us. Everyone's taken.

20:26.440 --> 20:29.520
Everyone needs help after the storm.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.160
You really don't have anyone at all?

20:33.440 --> 20:34.720
Well...

20:35.440 --> 20:38.280
You could try him. He's done here.

20:38.680 --> 20:40.800
Him over there? Thanks.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.440
Hello.

20:54.280 --> 20:58.120
I'm Jonna.
I heard you were done here.

20:58.200 --> 21:02.240
-I see. Who told you that?
-He did.

21:04.320 --> 21:08.440
-Maybe you need a new job?
-I'm already on my way to one.

21:09.320 --> 21:16.080
Will you take a look? There's a lot
to do, so it'll be worth your while.

21:16.160 --> 21:20.600
Jonna, was it?
I have a ferry to catch.

21:21.080 --> 21:25.040
If you take this job,
there's no need to get on a ferry.

21:25.880 --> 21:29.560
It's a small, family-owned inn.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.640
Sounds lovely.

21:32.600 --> 21:36.400
But there's nobody else
on the entire island.

21:36.480 --> 21:39.120
You are our only shot.
Please help us.

21:42.200 --> 21:46.440
-You always get what you want.
-I seize opportunities. Don't you?

21:52.080 --> 21:55.920
-All right, I'll have a look.
-Thanks. You can follow me.

22:04.680 --> 22:06.880
I've cleared the tree.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.800
I'm sorry about the insurance.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.120
Isn't it a bit early in the day?

22:19.720 --> 22:23.360
I've done the sums. We won't make it.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.160
-Is there nothing left?
-Not after the summer.

22:31.720 --> 22:34.880
Liv's and my savings are gone, too.

22:34.960 --> 22:38.440
-You'll get that money back.
-That's not what I meant.

22:38.520 --> 22:42.200
I meant the blackmail.

22:44.680 --> 22:47.160
Who do you think that was?

22:47.920 --> 22:50.480
-I used to think it was Konrad.
-No.

22:50.560 --> 22:53.640
If he had known,
we would have noticed.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.040
Stop drinking.

23:03.240 --> 23:06.040
What does Liv know?
Did you talk to her?

23:10.200 --> 23:12.640
She'll come back.

23:12.720 --> 23:17.720
When her 'inner journey'
or whatever is over.

23:18.720 --> 23:22.120
A journey like that
rarely brings people back.

23:24.080 --> 23:29.680
You never wanted to do that?
Drop everything and just leave?

23:29.760 --> 23:32.520
I guess I've done that my whole life.

23:35.600 --> 23:38.480
What are we even fighting for?

23:41.240 --> 23:44.280
-You were right, a lot of work.
-I know.

23:44.360 --> 23:48.240
Can you give us any kind of estimate?

23:49.040 --> 23:53.200
Hard to say.
I'll need to see all of it.

23:53.280 --> 23:55.960
This is my brother Lasse.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.400
-Hi there.
-Wille.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.960
-Wille has time to help us.
-All right.

24:02.720 --> 24:06.040
We'll be open for business
while you work. Is that all right?

24:06.120 --> 24:10.000
-Sure. We'll start in the back.
-Great.

24:10.080 --> 24:13.160
Listen... What about payment?

24:13.960 --> 24:16.840
-How do you mean?
-Just...

24:16.920 --> 24:20.640
If you want to bill us,
it'll only be after Christmas.

24:20.720 --> 24:22.640
Would that be all right?

24:25.760 --> 24:28.480
-Sure.
-That's great.

24:32.200 --> 24:34.920
-Where did you find him?
-Why?

24:35.560 --> 24:40.160
-Has he got references?
-We need help, he's helping.

24:40.240 --> 24:43.200
And we can pay him later.
Why are you whining?

24:43.280 --> 24:46.160
-I'm not whining.
-So what's your problem?

24:47.840 --> 24:51.840
-We'll start tomorrow morning.
-Great!

24:52.320 --> 24:55.880
-Are you from Åland?
-No, from elsewhere.

24:56.480 --> 24:59.640
We've got a deal. Perfect.

25:00.240 --> 25:03.000
-I'd like to see inside.
-Sure, come.

25:11.360 --> 25:14.360
-Lasse.
-It's me, Ulrika.

25:14.440 --> 25:18.520
-Did you hear from Kim?
-Don't you Skype with her every day?

25:18.600 --> 25:21.240
She hasn't called.
Did you speak to her?

25:21.320 --> 25:23.200
<i>No, it's been a while.</i>

25:24.040 --> 25:28.320
-I have a funny feeling.
-I'm sure she's fine.

25:28.800 --> 25:32.200
She called earlier,
but I was too busy to pick up.

25:32.280 --> 25:37.760
Should you find time to talk
to your daughter, ask her to call me.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.320
But...

25:46.680 --> 25:51.280
The matchboards are rotting all over.
They'll need replacing.

25:52.440 --> 25:54.680
The water's coming right through.

25:56.040 --> 25:59.040
How much are we talking?

26:00.240 --> 26:04.480
Replacing the boards,
a new ceiling, insulation...

26:04.560 --> 26:08.040
Forget the insulation,
how much for the ceiling?

26:08.440 --> 26:12.120
Not very much at all.
Heating the place, however...

26:12.200 --> 26:15.000
Talk about wasting money.

26:18.440 --> 26:21.400
Wille Ek... Never heard of him.

26:21.480 --> 26:25.520
-Is he from around here?
-No, why?

26:27.160 --> 26:32.600
-Can we trust his assessment?
-Anyone can spot a leaky ceiling.

26:33.400 --> 26:37.440
Practically every single motchboard
is rotten.

26:38.400 --> 26:43.400
Right, so what do we do?
Can we get a loan?

26:43.480 --> 26:47.120
-Isn't it 'matchboard'?
-Motchboard, matchboard, who cares?

26:47.200 --> 26:50.360
-They're rotten anyway.
-Can we get a loan?

26:51.920 --> 26:55.960
Not without a new estimate.
How do you think that would go?

26:56.040 --> 26:57.880
Lasse is right.

27:04.880 --> 27:07.160
So should we sell the place?

27:13.840 --> 27:15.760
What do you think?

27:17.120 --> 27:19.960
Yeah... I mean, why not?

27:20.040 --> 27:23.280
Financially,
that would be disastrous.

27:23.360 --> 27:26.520
Two months ago, this was lucrative.
Now it's a bankrupt business.

27:26.600 --> 27:30.120
We can't run it,
so what choice do we have?

27:33.560 --> 27:36.360
I saw Mikael Rosén today,
and we should...

27:36.440 --> 27:42.560
No way. I'll never sell to him.
Someone else, but not that prick.

27:42.640 --> 27:49.360
Then who? Who on Åland has
the money to buy a collapsing inn?

27:49.440 --> 27:53.280
If Jonna and I want to sell
to Rosén, you can't stop us.

27:53.360 --> 27:57.400
You can't buy us out, and it's two
against one. We're equal partners.

27:57.480 --> 28:02.840
Legally, sure. But do we have equal
say? I took care of the place.

28:02.920 --> 28:07.280
Not took care, you mean. With
proper upkeep we wouldn't be here.

28:07.360 --> 28:11.920
Great. Big brother teaching his
little brother about maintenance.

28:12.000 --> 28:16.280
-Can we work this out?
-I know maintenance is easier sober.

28:16.360 --> 28:19.680
How would you know?
You've never owned a house.

28:19.760 --> 28:23.720
-At least I pay my insurance!
-Why didn't I think of that?

28:23.800 --> 28:27.200
We'll get a new insurance
and give you some petrol and a match.

28:27.280 --> 28:31.200
-I didn't torch my restaurant!
-No, you had someone else do it!

28:31.280 --> 28:35.880
Do whatever you want!
Sell, stay. I don't give a shit!

28:38.080 --> 28:40.360
-You're leaving?
-He always does.

28:40.440 --> 28:44.720
Stop it! Was that really necessary?

28:44.800 --> 28:46.440
What?

28:47.320 --> 28:52.840
-We're all in the same boat.
-The same sinking boat.

28:56.880 --> 28:58.760
I'll make some coffee.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.520
Oh, what the hell...

29:28.280 --> 29:30.160
Hello!

29:30.240 --> 29:34.280
I didn't mean to scare you.
I wanted to surprise you.

29:34.360 --> 29:38.360
-I'm not sure we should be...
-I went through the woods.

29:38.440 --> 29:40.360
Nobody saw me.

29:41.160 --> 29:42.600
God...

29:42.680 --> 29:46.160
-Are you all right? I was worried.
-We're fine.

29:46.240 --> 29:49.560
But the inn was roughed up a bit.

29:49.640 --> 29:52.080
Let me know if I can help.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.600
Sit down.

30:01.160 --> 30:06.440
I don't think we should meet here.
Not as long as they're here.

30:10.200 --> 30:15.960
It just feels a bit off,
sneaking around like this.

30:18.760 --> 30:21.880
They wouldn't understand. Okay?

30:22.720 --> 30:25.560
Give it time.
I'll just come to you instead.

30:27.280 --> 30:29.280
-All right.
-All right?

30:30.240 --> 30:33.360
I liked it better
when it was just the two of us.

30:55.760 --> 30:57.680
Hello, Lasse.

30:58.480 --> 31:00.840
-You're back, too?
-That's right.

31:01.840 --> 31:05.680
-Did you find a contractor?
-We did.

31:05.760 --> 31:08.680
So there'll be Christmas dinners
again this year.

31:08.760 --> 31:12.600
I'm not sure. I'm on my way
to Stockholm. Petrol on number 2.

31:12.680 --> 31:15.000
Back to your restaurant?

31:15.400 --> 31:18.480
That would be tricky,
seeing as someone torched it.

31:18.560 --> 31:21.040
-55 euros.
-That's right.

31:21.120 --> 31:24.280
I'm sure you've got something else
in the pipeline.

31:24.360 --> 31:26.760
'Card declined', it says.

31:26.840 --> 31:30.400
That must be a mistake. Try again.

31:32.200 --> 31:33.680
Sorry.

31:36.480 --> 31:38.880
No, I'm sorry.

31:38.960 --> 31:42.200
I've got some cash in the car.
I'll be right back.

31:51.800 --> 31:55.040
Lasse? I took care of it.

31:55.760 --> 31:58.360
-Right, here...
-No, that's all right.

31:59.760 --> 32:05.560
We sure would miss those dinners.
It's tradition around here.

32:05.640 --> 32:09.240
Well, maybe it's time for a change.

32:10.080 --> 32:15.760
You know where I stand,
so keep in touch. Enjoy Stockholm.

34:52.840 --> 34:55.360
Is it over between you and Liv?

34:56.040 --> 34:58.960
Please, ask me more simple questions.

34:59.040 --> 35:01.440
-How many cards?
-Give me one.

35:10.240 --> 35:12.920
What was that? That.

35:14.880 --> 35:18.200
I meant to get rid of it,
I just forgot before.

35:20.160 --> 35:24.000
-Aren't you too old for that?
-Stop it, I'm not cheating.

35:27.520 --> 35:32.520
Jonna. I'm sorry if things didn't
work out the way you wanted.

35:32.640 --> 35:37.240
I hope you didn't lose a part
because you had to come back here.

35:37.320 --> 35:39.400
I didn't.

35:39.480 --> 35:42.240
Things went south before that.

35:44.560 --> 35:48.040
-How many?
-One, please.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.840
Aren't you cheerful?

35:53.400 --> 35:55.160
Shouldn't you be on a ferry?

35:56.440 --> 35:59.840
This should cover the matchboards.

36:01.280 --> 36:03.880
And this should cover the hot tubs.

36:07.840 --> 36:12.640
-Where did you get this?
-I robbed a gas station.

36:15.080 --> 36:19.000
From the bank. The insurance money
for the restaurant came.

36:19.080 --> 36:24.760
-What, now?
-Yes. Well... A while back.

36:24.840 --> 36:30.120
I was going to buy my own place.
You know, own a flat.

36:30.800 --> 36:33.840
But there are lots of rooms here.

36:34.280 --> 36:38.000
Are you serious? It's done?

36:38.880 --> 36:43.760
-How much did you get?
-Enough to get us started.

36:43.840 --> 36:48.120
Then we'll have to rely on Jonna's
brilliant ideas to turn us a profit.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.200
They will.

36:50.280 --> 36:54.200
-What are we playing?
-Some form of poker.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.840
-I'm winning.
-Jonna's poker.

36:57.800 --> 37:00.600
Stop it, I'm not cheating!

37:10.600 --> 37:14.320
We need to stop for flowers, too.
We've got time.

37:15.840 --> 37:19.200
-There. There you go.
-Thank you.

37:23.880 --> 37:29.080
No, I'm looking for something
a bit more... Yes, like that!

37:31.320 --> 37:33.560
Oskar is going to freak out.

37:45.640 --> 37:48.080
Wouldn't the hot tubs go well here?

37:48.520 --> 37:51.040
-Sure.
-That would be lovely.

37:53.880 --> 37:56.200
Do you mean it this time?

37:57.040 --> 37:59.360
You're not going to mess it up?

38:00.840 --> 38:03.200
-No.
-Promise me.

38:03.920 --> 38:05.400
I promise.

38:13.920 --> 38:16.680
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

38:21.600 --> 38:23.280
What is it?

38:24.360 --> 38:30.680
Would you go over to Konrad's
and ask him about ice-fishing spots?

38:30.760 --> 38:32.960
Please, Oskar.

38:33.440 --> 38:36.120
I'm not asking him.
I can find my own spots.

38:36.200 --> 38:40.160
-What is your problem?
-Did you need anything else?

38:42.880 --> 38:44.880
Is it serious?

38:47.120 --> 38:50.080
-With Petra.
-I don't know what you mean.

38:50.160 --> 38:51.480
I saw you.

38:55.560 --> 38:59.720
I don't know how it happened.
It just did.

39:00.360 --> 39:05.960
Do you want to be with her?
Or is she just a rebound?

39:08.840 --> 39:11.520
-I'm not sure.
-Find out.

39:12.080 --> 39:14.520
Don't give her the wrong idea.

39:50.200 --> 39:55.040
-Moonlighting for the coast guard?
-I go where I'm needed.

39:55.720 --> 40:00.040
-What brings you here?
-Nothing. I heard the chopper.

40:00.760 --> 40:02.480
Any survivors?

40:02.560 --> 40:07.080
They're looking, but it's unlikely.
The water is too cold.

40:07.720 --> 40:10.200
-Is it from here?
-Estonia, they think.

40:10.280 --> 40:13.720
When you came out,
did you notice any flames?

40:14.280 --> 40:15.560
Yes.

40:22.120 --> 40:26.640
You'd better get out of the way,
but I'll be by with more questions.

40:49.800 --> 40:53.160
-Need an assistant?
-No, I've got it.

40:54.840 --> 40:57.360
-Are you done for the day?
-Yes.

40:59.960 --> 41:02.200
Could you give me a hand?

41:13.040 --> 41:15.080
-Here.
-Thanks.

41:32.440 --> 41:33.840
Thanks.

41:47.640 --> 41:51.280
Shit! I'm impressed. Well done.

41:51.360 --> 41:55.360
I'd say.
Now we just need some guests.

41:57.040 --> 42:00.200
This ad will be in tomorrow's paper.

42:00.280 --> 42:03.640
-When did you make that?
-I try to be efficient.

42:04.080 --> 42:06.520
-Sandwich?
-Yes, please.

42:08.960 --> 42:12.840
Nice. Can I have the car keys?
I'm heading out.

42:15.800 --> 42:21.240
-Off to your rebound?
-She means more to me than that.

42:21.320 --> 42:24.400
-All right.
-And mind your own business.

42:32.520 --> 42:36.120
-Good morning.
-Good morning, best brother ever.

42:38.520 --> 42:41.120
-The ad looks great.
-Thanks.

42:42.840 --> 42:46.040
I should go wake up Oskar.
We've got lots to do.

42:46.120 --> 42:48.040
I don't think he's here.

42:48.120 --> 42:50.400
Where else would he be?

42:51.720 --> 42:57.120
-The hot tubs. Can you get it?
-Sure, best brother ever is on it.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.480
Liv?

43:23.360 --> 43:26.360
