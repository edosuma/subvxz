00:21.972 --> 00:24.305
You can put the drinks down.
These are not for you...

00:24.365 --> 00:25.434
Put the fucking drinks down!

00:25.539 --> 00:27.878
Whoa. Hey, hey, Jeannie.
Thank you.

00:27.998 --> 00:30.880
Probably not a great idea
to be drinking tonight.

00:30.914 --> 00:34.418
It's fucking over.
What? It's not over.

00:34.452 --> 00:36.019
Oh, it's over.
No.

00:36.054 --> 00:37.688
Hey, what we need to do--

00:37.722 --> 00:39.890
is we need to get hammered,

00:39.924 --> 00:42.025
and we fuck the shit out of some interns.
Okay.

00:42.060 --> 00:43.528
Why are you so profane?

00:43.563 --> 00:45.198
Can I get an imminent demise?
Imminent demise?

00:45.232 --> 00:46.565
Oh, imminent demise?

00:46.600 --> 00:48.569
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
Can I get an imminent demise?

00:48.603 --> 00:49.836
Imminent demise!

00:49.871 --> 00:52.707
Imminent demise,
imminent demise...

00:52.741 --> 00:54.908
Let it out.
...imminent demise...

00:54.943 --> 00:56.443
Yeah. Yeah.
...imminent demise.

00:58.079 --> 00:59.245
Well, it's true.

00:59.279 --> 01:01.379
They're taking us
from a top-tier

01:01.414 --> 01:06.049
global consulting firm
to an in-house consulting group.

01:06.084 --> 01:08.584
Which is bullshit-tonian

01:08.618 --> 01:11.953
for cutting 15/16ths
of our workforce.

01:11.987 --> 01:14.054
That ain't good.

01:14.089 --> 01:16.625
And no matter
how you slice it...

01:19.897 --> 01:22.932
...it's going to look
a little something like this.

02:03.537 --> 02:07.074
Beautiful, man.
It's beautiful, man!

02:07.108 --> 02:08.842
It's beautiful!

02:26.612 --> 02:29.001
Welcome to the new economy,
America.

02:29.121 --> 02:33.438
Where only the richest, meanest,
and smartest will remain.

02:33.930 --> 02:35.664
Including that motherfucker

02:35.699 --> 02:40.236
who pulled a serious Judas
on my ass-- the Rainmaker.

02:40.271 --> 02:44.507
Oh, yeah, out of all these mean,
smart fucknuts who survive,

02:44.541 --> 02:46.743
I'm not one of them.

02:57.388 --> 03:00.623
I don't think you really want
a recommendation from me,

03:00.658 --> 03:02.192
no matter how glowing it is.

03:02.226 --> 03:05.027
I got so many enemies, it'd be
like a death sentence anyway.

03:05.062 --> 03:07.997
Right, but you would give me
a glowing reference, right?

03:08.031 --> 03:09.798
Yeah.

03:09.833 --> 03:12.267
Might I get a hint as...
as to what it might look like?

03:12.302 --> 03:14.536
You got to stop.
Seriously.

03:14.570 --> 03:16.305
What? Oh, come on.
No, one gets inquiries,

03:16.339 --> 03:19.208
one wants to know that one's
references are rock solid, right?

03:19.242 --> 03:21.944
From whom did one get inquiries?

03:21.978 --> 03:24.280
Oh, my God, no.

03:24.314 --> 03:26.048
No, no, no, no.

03:26.083 --> 03:28.117
Congratulations.
For what?

03:28.151 --> 03:30.153
Clyde Oberholt has
just been named

03:30.187 --> 03:32.355
in the 25 under 30 of
management consultants. Boom!

03:32.389 --> 03:34.057
Yeah. I know, I'm as
shocked as you are.

03:34.091 --> 03:37.060
The 25 most connected, highest
earning young consultants

03:37.094 --> 03:38.728
in the business.
Young consultants in the business.

03:38.763 --> 03:40.464
You see? When you believe
in yourself.

03:40.498 --> 03:43.233
Maybe I was too obvious a
choice. Is that possible?

03:43.267 --> 03:44.634
Congratulations, Clyde.

03:44.669 --> 03:45.668
Seriously.

03:45.703 --> 03:46.870
Thank you, Jeannie.

03:46.904 --> 03:48.971
One day for you, you know that.
Good job, junior.

03:49.006 --> 03:50.306
Thank you...
I appreciate it.

03:50.340 --> 03:51.908
Straight out of Harvard,
right into Galweather.

03:51.942 --> 03:55.577
Maybe that was my problem.
You know, the wunderkind thing.

03:55.612 --> 03:57.479
I didn't have enough
of an underdog quality.

03:57.514 --> 03:59.081
It's got to be
something in that.

03:59.115 --> 04:00.749
Not Jewish, you know, not from
a second-tier school.

04:00.784 --> 04:02.384
Whoa, anti-Semite,
why don't you take a chill

04:02.419 --> 04:03.552
for one second, okay?

04:03.587 --> 04:05.755
Are you kidding me?
Fucking pre-schoolers...

04:05.789 --> 04:07.990
Who cares if Clyde just pledged

04:08.024 --> 04:09.358
Sigma Chi?

04:09.392 --> 04:11.761
We're on a plane, it's on fire,

04:11.795 --> 04:14.197
billowing smoke
coming out of the engines.

04:14.231 --> 04:15.832
There's a gaping hole
in the cabin,

04:15.866 --> 04:18.267
people being sucked out
to certain death.

04:18.301 --> 04:20.002
So...?

04:20.036 --> 04:21.670
Of course. S-stupid.

04:21.704 --> 04:23.338
It's just I'm a people person.

04:23.373 --> 04:26.074
No, no, buddy,
that's not your thing.

04:26.109 --> 04:28.210
I'm not a people person, I get
that, but what about my numbers?

04:28.244 --> 04:29.845
Would you fuck this
if you saw it?

04:29.879 --> 04:31.080
Whoa.
Yeah, I know.

04:31.114 --> 04:32.348
What, um...
Shark week.

04:32.382 --> 04:34.416
Hi, sycophants.

04:34.450 --> 04:38.086
Hi.
Just putting a bow on my deliverables.

04:38.121 --> 04:40.089
But you, you are the man

04:40.123 --> 04:42.791
I have been looking for.
Me?

04:42.826 --> 04:44.926
Mm-hmm.
Oh, why? Thank you... Huh?

04:44.961 --> 04:46.261
Clyde Oberholt.

04:46.296 --> 04:48.564
Oh, no.
Doug G5ggenheim.

04:48.598 --> 04:50.132
Oh, no, not you.

04:50.167 --> 04:51.634
You.

04:51.668 --> 04:54.403
That would be me.
Aha. Yeah.

04:54.437 --> 04:56.238
25 under 30, huh?

04:56.273 --> 04:59.609
Hey, what can I say?
That is an honor. It's very impressive.

04:59.643 --> 05:02.112
How did we miss you
over at Kinsley?

05:02.146 --> 05:04.582
You've actually met me, like, 50 times.
Don't kill your moment

05:04.616 --> 05:05.983
by making a lot of sous.

05:06.018 --> 05:09.621
Now, listen, if your pod fails,

05:09.656 --> 05:11.958
you should give me a call.

05:11.992 --> 05:13.092
Sure.

05:13.127 --> 05:15.628
Is Marty in his office?

05:18.632 --> 05:21.100
Uh-uh. Leave it open.

05:21.134 --> 05:22.935
Oh, come on, let 'em talk.

05:22.970 --> 05:25.438
It's not the talking I'm worried
about, Monica, it's the fucking.

05:25.473 --> 05:27.007
No, it's not.

05:27.041 --> 05:31.312
All you care about right now
is saving your own ass.

05:31.346 --> 05:33.681
Okay, you got me.

05:33.715 --> 05:34.748
Mm-hmm.

05:34.783 --> 05:35.816
What do you got?

05:35.851 --> 05:37.117
What's in it for me?

05:37.152 --> 05:39.987
Maybe you could roll over
on that custody battle.

05:40.022 --> 05:42.189
Get the fuck out of my office.

05:42.223 --> 05:44.258
Joking. Jesus.

05:44.292 --> 05:48.362
I mean, I was checking
a little bit.

05:48.397 --> 05:51.632
Leads. Do you have
anything that I would want?

05:51.666 --> 05:55.869
I may have something
you'd be interested in.

05:55.903 --> 05:59.005
But what do you got?

05:59.040 --> 06:02.309
I think you show me yours,
and then I show you mine.

06:03.711 --> 06:05.612
BP is looking at a top down.

06:05.647 --> 06:07.647
Why is it that I haven't
heard about this yet?

06:07.682 --> 06:09.315
Because I'm about
to close on the fucker

06:09.350 --> 06:11.484
in two seconds, all right?

06:12.720 --> 06:14.187
Deal.

06:15.256 --> 06:16.723
Yes.

06:16.757 --> 06:18.991
Okay?
What?

06:19.026 --> 06:20.860
Oh, right, yes.

06:20.894 --> 06:23.062
Galweather Stearn has a little
bit of a problem.

06:23.096 --> 06:25.030
It's a genuine

06:25.064 --> 06:29.867
pandemic of sexual harassment
and misconduct.

06:29.902 --> 06:31.902
That's it?
That's it.

06:31.936 --> 06:34.238
I traded BP top down
for some grab-ass

06:34.272 --> 06:35.806
at Galweather Stearn?

06:35.840 --> 06:37.340
Monica, every shop
has sexual misconduct.

06:37.375 --> 06:39.375
Do you think I don't know about ours?
Oh.

06:39.410 --> 06:41.811
You know what, I'm going
to just get some boxes

06:41.846 --> 06:43.380
and start collecting my shit.
Excuse me.

06:43.414 --> 06:47.383
This is a real culture
of quid pro quo advancement

06:47.417 --> 06:49.418
for sexual favors.

06:49.452 --> 06:52.654
And your little boyfriend the
Rainmaker is the head fucker.

06:52.689 --> 06:55.157
He will bang anything
with a snapper.

06:55.191 --> 06:57.393
Yes. I'm well aware
of Marco's predilections.

06:57.427 --> 06:59.829
Oh, that's okay.
You just take your time.

06:59.863 --> 07:02.265
I don't need the machine
or anything like that.

07:02.299 --> 07:06.070
Marty, we are talking
full-on sex addiction here.

07:06.104 --> 07:07.771
High double digits.

07:07.806 --> 07:09.740
Yeah?
These rumors, they have

07:09.775 --> 07:13.778
a direct correlation between
business and sexual favors.

07:13.813 --> 07:16.548
There's hush money, payoffs.

07:16.582 --> 07:19.117
This could be one
sexy class action.

07:19.151 --> 07:20.118
Ooh.

07:20.152 --> 07:21.453
Are you getting horny?

07:21.487 --> 07:24.623
Fuck, yeah. This harassment
talk just got me hot.

07:27.627 --> 07:29.528
Hey, man.

07:29.562 --> 07:31.263
Dad?
Yeah.

07:31.297 --> 07:33.365
You fell asleep, bud.

07:33.399 --> 07:35.733
It's okay.
I fell asleep because I was waiting for you

07:35.768 --> 07:37.368
to help me on my Mayans report.

07:37.403 --> 07:40.572
Oh, yeah, the Mayans.
That's right. I remember.

07:40.606 --> 07:42.240
I didn't let Grandpa help me

07:42.274 --> 07:43.608
because you said you would.

07:43.642 --> 07:46.578
Yeah. I'm sorry.

07:46.612 --> 07:49.247
It's just been real intense
at work lately, you know?

07:49.282 --> 07:52.050
I know, but I have
intense times, too.

07:52.084 --> 07:53.652
I know.

07:53.686 --> 07:56.287
I'm going to help you
work on it tomorrow, okay?

07:56.322 --> 07:57.622
That's a promise.

07:57.656 --> 07:59.290
Come on, let's go to bed.

07:59.325 --> 08:03.594
The Mayans believed that
the world would end in 2012.

08:03.629 --> 08:06.498
What do you think?

08:06.532 --> 08:10.068
The Mayans were pretty smart.
Yeah?

08:10.103 --> 08:13.138
You better rest up for
the Apocalypse then, huh?

08:15.676 --> 08:18.144
<i>Every week</i>
<i>we waltz into companies</i>

08:18.179 --> 08:21.281
just like this one and tell
them how to fix their shit.

08:21.316 --> 08:23.183
Well, this week it's us.

08:23.217 --> 08:24.484
We're the case.

08:24.518 --> 08:27.153
And we are nothing
special, ladies.

08:27.187 --> 08:29.422
We are vulnerable to the
exigencies of the marketplace

08:29.456 --> 08:30.756
just like any
other motherfuckers.

08:30.790 --> 08:32.792
Now in the case
of Galweather Stearn

08:32.826 --> 08:35.160
it has come to my attention

08:35.195 --> 08:38.496
that there is a sexual
harassment element.

08:38.532 --> 08:41.633
Sexual harassment?
Do tell, Obi Wan.

08:41.668 --> 08:43.602
Certain senior partners have
been using their power

08:43.635 --> 08:45.137
and considerable influence

08:45.171 --> 08:47.305
to bang the hotter, younger
elements of the company

08:47.339 --> 08:49.640
in exchange for
favorable advancement.

08:49.675 --> 08:50.808
Now that's a big no-no.

08:50.842 --> 08:52.510
Do you think K. Warren
is going to want

08:52.544 --> 08:54.712
to pay the scrilla to untangle
some messy lawsuit?

08:54.746 --> 08:56.280
No, sir.
Hell, no.

08:56.314 --> 08:57.815
He's gonna back the fuck up.

08:57.849 --> 09:00.985
So here's what we do:
we poison the well.

09:01.019 --> 09:02.953
We bring a class action lawsuit.

09:02.987 --> 09:05.989
We convince Metro Capital
to pull out of the deal.

09:06.023 --> 09:07.857
Then we make this
lawsuit go away,

09:07.892 --> 09:10.293
we sweeten the well back up,

09:10.327 --> 09:13.329
and we get back to the business
of making big money.

09:13.363 --> 09:14.563
That's the play.

09:14.598 --> 09:16.198
I love that play.
How many women?

09:16.233 --> 09:18.634
Or men. Hold on. Or men.
Men get harassed as well.

09:18.668 --> 09:20.502
- You wish.
- Yeah, well, that's the rub.

09:20.537 --> 09:22.537
Nobody wants to be
first to the dance floor.

09:22.572 --> 09:25.139
I mean, who wants to be Patient
Zero in this case, right?

09:25.174 --> 09:27.141
So what do we do?
Well...

09:27.176 --> 09:28.409
first we have to find them,
and...

09:28.443 --> 09:30.477
Once we find them,
we have to convince them

09:30.511 --> 09:34.014
that stepping forward leads
to a shiny, happier life.

09:34.048 --> 09:35.849
And they're going to get
some fuck-you money

09:35.883 --> 09:38.419
out of the deal, too.
All right. Jeannie?

09:40.755 --> 09:41.990
Let's do this.

09:42.024 --> 09:44.425
Let's do it.
Okay.

09:47.196 --> 09:48.931
<i>Hey, Rachel...</i>

09:48.965 --> 09:51.500
You know what we haven't
spoken about in, like, forever?

09:51.534 --> 09:52.902
Sexual assault.

09:52.936 --> 09:54.570
<i>Hey, man, I got it from here.</i>

09:54.605 --> 09:55.939
You can go, it's just numbers.

09:55.973 --> 09:57.206
What? What are you...?
We'll figure it out.

09:57.241 --> 09:59.108
Start again. Um...

09:59.142 --> 10:00.743
when a man loves
a woman... when...

10:00.777 --> 10:02.378
I feel like we haven't
talked in so long,

10:02.412 --> 10:04.112
this is so embarrassing.
You look good, by the way.

10:04.147 --> 10:06.381
You been working out?
I'll see you, though.

10:06.415 --> 10:07.682
<i>Rumors are flying,</i>

10:07.717 --> 10:10.017
and, uh, I mean,
good-looking guy like you?

10:10.052 --> 10:11.419
You're not immune.

10:11.453 --> 10:13.554
So if anybody's hurt you,
or abused you...

10:13.588 --> 10:15.889
You're with a friend.
Whoops! Okay.

10:15.923 --> 10:17.557
...and I'll be here for you.

10:21.996 --> 10:24.365
My brother from another mother!

10:24.399 --> 10:26.534
Come on!
Hi, Greg.

10:26.568 --> 10:28.570
Hey. This is, uh, Malina.

10:28.604 --> 10:30.071
Check her out.

10:30.106 --> 10:32.440
I went to the Jeannie store,
and I got me a good one.

10:32.475 --> 10:34.209
Jeannie store? Wow.
That's right.

10:34.244 --> 10:35.711
Malina teaches at a place called

10:35.745 --> 10:37.980
- Yoga Works, and...
-  Come on.

10:38.014 --> 10:39.982
Yoga works, right?
Yes, it does.

10:40.016 --> 10:41.250
Hi, Malina. I'm Jeannie.
Hi.

10:41.284 --> 10:43.152
Greg. You look
super casual.

10:43.186 --> 10:44.420
Super casual.

10:44.454 --> 10:45.954
Well, very astute, Jeannie.

10:45.989 --> 10:48.657
I look casual, I feel casual,
and I'm out.

10:48.691 --> 10:50.793
I am through with the banking

10:50.827 --> 10:52.661
rat race. Good riddance.

10:52.696 --> 10:54.263
And guess what?

10:54.297 --> 10:57.399
I'm going to start
a little consulting firm

10:57.433 --> 10:59.801
of my very own.
Wow.

10:59.836 --> 11:02.837
Wow is right, because
"those who can't do, consult."

11:02.871 --> 11:04.105
Right, Marty?

11:04.139 --> 11:05.806
Right, Greg.
That's right.

11:05.841 --> 11:08.676
Well, I'm sorry about
the whole merger thing.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.477
K. Warren's going to
rip your company apart

11:10.512 --> 11:12.913
in about 30 seconds.
He is a wicked warlock.

11:12.947 --> 11:15.248
He'd cut your liver out
and eat it for breakfast.

11:15.283 --> 11:18.118
But... moving on, huh?

11:18.152 --> 11:21.188
Yoga, kite-boarding,

11:21.222 --> 11:23.924
very young women...right, Jeannie?
Malina.

11:23.958 --> 11:25.625
That's Jeannie.
Malina. Jeannie.

11:25.660 --> 11:27.094
It's too bad you
missed your shot.

11:27.128 --> 11:28.495
You could've been
by my side tonight.

11:28.530 --> 11:30.197
Hey, you know what? You still
could. It's not too late.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.599
What about... you two girls?
What do you say? We could...

11:32.633 --> 11:34.035
No.
The three of us...

11:34.069 --> 11:36.337
Greg, that is a terrible idea.
But you gotta ask, though.

11:36.371 --> 11:37.872
No.
I guess <i>you</i> gotta ask.

11:37.907 --> 11:39.307
Hello, hello, hello?

11:39.341 --> 11:40.809
Hello.

11:40.843 --> 11:45.180
Galweather Stearn, AKA

11:45.215 --> 11:49.385
Metro Capital's
Galweather Group!

11:51.555 --> 11:54.691
The Galweather Group.

11:56.694 --> 12:01.797
You ever hear of ovophagy?

12:01.832 --> 12:05.133
Sharks, in utero,

12:05.168 --> 12:07.936
eat their own brothers
and sisters.

12:09.505 --> 12:12.607
The strong survive.

12:15.076 --> 12:18.144
Now, I know that
there's been a lot of

12:18.179 --> 12:24.985
speculation about what the new
normal will be at Galweather,

12:25.019 --> 12:27.755
once we have joined forces
with the most powerful

12:27.789 --> 12:30.524
banking institution
in the country.

12:30.558 --> 12:32.259
Well...

12:32.294 --> 12:34.395
it's gonna be fan...

12:34.430 --> 12:35.864
fucking...

12:35.898 --> 12:39.768
tastic!

12:41.237 --> 12:43.672
Yeah!

12:43.706 --> 12:46.708
Oh, and will there
be some reorgs?

12:46.743 --> 12:48.544
Ohh...

12:48.578 --> 12:50.613
Some counsel-outs?

12:50.647 --> 12:51.881
Ohh...

12:51.916 --> 12:54.784
Yeah, there will be.

12:54.818 --> 12:57.787
But those of you who have
stayed the course,

12:57.821 --> 12:59.055
you will be rewarded.

13:00.924 --> 13:02.925
Because we stand by our own.

13:02.959 --> 13:04.893
In fact, right now,

13:04.928 --> 13:08.430
right now, our new CEO,

13:08.464 --> 13:10.198
K. Warren McDale,

13:10.232 --> 13:12.734
is on board his jet

13:12.768 --> 13:16.738
to come here and personally
congratulate all of you,

13:16.772 --> 13:18.073
on this...

13:20.176 --> 13:22.577
...this very special night.

13:31.588 --> 13:34.624
None of these women
wants to be the first.

13:35.926 --> 13:37.660
We just need one.

13:37.694 --> 13:40.229
I'm telling you, one woman
comes forward, the floodgates--

13:40.263 --> 13:43.165
phew-- open right up.

13:43.199 --> 13:45.000
Okay. I can't be the
only one wondering this.

13:45.034 --> 13:46.935
By "dinner attire,"
do they mean black tie?

13:46.969 --> 13:48.970
Because I can never tell in LA.

13:49.005 --> 13:51.572
At Harvard, "dinner attire,"
bam, black tie, you know.

13:51.607 --> 13:53.608
Who fucking cares, Doug?
We're all getting fired.

13:53.642 --> 13:55.142
Okay. Sure, but...

13:55.177 --> 13:57.178
you at least want to get
the dress code right.

13:57.212 --> 13:58.947
What's Wes wearing?

13:58.981 --> 14:00.181
He's working.

14:00.216 --> 14:01.082
Okay.

14:02.452 --> 14:05.354
So, does anyone have any
job offers on the table?

14:05.388 --> 14:06.989
Nope.
No?

14:07.023 --> 14:08.424
Well, Jeannie's engaged
to Richie Rich,

14:08.458 --> 14:10.093
so she doesn't even need
a job anymore, right?

14:10.127 --> 14:11.595
Fuck you, Clyde.

14:11.629 --> 14:13.831
So... any? No? Oh.
That's interesting.

14:13.865 --> 14:16.200
That's interesting. Nobody? Anybody?

14:16.235 --> 14:17.869
Do you want to tell us
something, Doug?

14:17.903 --> 14:19.471
No, I... God, no.
I think that would be gauche.

14:19.505 --> 14:21.606
But you're twisting my arm,
now I feel like I have to.

14:21.641 --> 14:23.175
I'm not.
Hey, I got an idea.

14:23.209 --> 14:24.976
Why don't you guys get
back to fucking work?

14:25.011 --> 14:26.511
Well, actually, you might
find this

14:26.546 --> 14:28.513
interesting, Marty.
Not gonna find it interesting, Doug.

14:28.548 --> 14:31.283
Well, let's find out.
Uh, you guys ready for this?

14:31.317 --> 14:33.385
Okay, I'm going to freestyle
here for a little bit,

14:33.420 --> 14:35.487
so... just go with me. Uh...

14:35.521 --> 14:37.656
I've actually gotten
a pretty sweet offer

14:37.691 --> 14:39.158
from a river-rafting company

14:39.192 --> 14:41.660
on the middle fork
of the Salmon River.

14:41.695 --> 14:43.129
Oh, not the middle fork!

14:43.163 --> 14:44.664
Fork, yeah.

14:44.698 --> 14:47.667
So for me, the timing
is kind of... perfect.

14:47.702 --> 14:49.203
What about you, Mr. Popular?

14:49.237 --> 14:52.473
I mean, how do I follow that?
I'll try. Um...

14:52.507 --> 14:55.509
I have a very interesting bite
from Kinsley.

14:55.544 --> 14:57.211
From Kinsley? Really?
Yeah.

14:57.245 --> 14:58.979
And I'm architecting a few
financial instruments

14:59.013 --> 15:02.849
that would make the entire
notion of work so 2012.

15:02.884 --> 15:05.885
Fuck, damn it.
Fuck you, Clyde! Oh, ho ho ho!

15:05.920 --> 15:07.587
You're a fucking thief!
Is this Round Two?

15:07.621 --> 15:09.355
Good idea. All right. Round Two!
Yeah, bring it!

15:09.390 --> 15:11.858
I'm the architect of financial
instruments. Me, not you!

15:11.892 --> 15:14.427
Are you going to start wearing
fucking sweater vests, now?

15:14.461 --> 15:16.729
You wouldn't see me caught dead
in a fucking sweater vest.

15:16.764 --> 15:18.364
Why? You stole everything
else from me!

15:18.399 --> 15:19.666
Hey. Hey.
No, because I'm not...

15:22.904 --> 15:25.838
I'm looking at this case.
We got dick.

15:25.873 --> 15:27.240
We got less than dick.

15:27.274 --> 15:29.376
You want to do
this shit right now?

15:30.745 --> 15:32.112
You're all gonna be fine.

15:32.146 --> 15:34.280
Everybody here.
Scarecrow...

15:34.315 --> 15:36.582
Shithead Kinsley...
You too, Blondie.

15:36.617 --> 15:38.351
I'm the one that's
gonna be fucked.

15:38.385 --> 15:40.286
Why don't you shut the fuck up

15:40.320 --> 15:42.020
and see if you can
find Norma Rae?

16:12.286 --> 16:14.020
Oh, shit.

16:44.319 --> 16:46.788
Throwing it
back tonight, huh?

16:46.822 --> 16:48.289
Yep.

16:48.323 --> 16:49.590
Very drinky.

16:49.625 --> 16:51.493
Yes. Very, very drinky.

16:51.527 --> 16:53.328
Don't die, okay?

16:54.563 --> 16:56.331
Marty...

16:56.366 --> 16:59.101
Do you know why I'm good
at what I do, Jeannie?

16:59.135 --> 17:01.003
I'm good...

17:01.037 --> 17:03.606
because I read
people's behavior.

17:03.640 --> 17:05.441
That's the only thing
that makes me different

17:05.474 --> 17:07.009
than all these other jabonies.

17:07.042 --> 17:11.780
I read behavior just a little
bit better than they do.

17:11.815 --> 17:14.950
So you know what I mean when I
tell you I've been reading yours

17:14.984 --> 17:16.218
for the past three days.

17:18.188 --> 17:20.990
You think I don't know
that you sold out your team,

17:21.023 --> 17:23.960
and your boss, and yourself?

17:25.429 --> 17:28.198
You think I can't see
that gaping, sucking hole

17:28.232 --> 17:30.634
in the middle of you
that you call a soul?

17:30.668 --> 17:33.837
I got the same fucking one,
Jeannie, okay?

17:33.871 --> 17:36.006
You're trying to fill it up by

17:36.040 --> 17:38.508
sleeping with this
fucking prick?

17:38.542 --> 17:40.010
Look, I'm not going to
blow you up, okay?

17:40.044 --> 17:42.245
I'm not going to tell
you how to play it,

17:42.279 --> 17:43.713
I'm not gonna burn
down your life,

17:43.748 --> 17:46.516
I'm not gonna try to
fuck up your wedding.

17:46.551 --> 17:48.018
But...

17:48.052 --> 17:51.354
you did not do your
team any favors.

17:59.296 --> 18:01.497
You going somewhere?

18:01.532 --> 18:05.201
When you tell this story later,

18:05.235 --> 18:07.637
make me sound good, okay?

18:17.413 --> 18:21.749
I would like to make a toast...

18:21.784 --> 18:24.452
to some of the women
at Galweather...

18:24.486 --> 18:27.287
who, when they stand with me,

18:27.322 --> 18:30.791
will indicate that they are part
of a class action lawsuit

18:30.825 --> 18:36.029
against Metro Capital's
Galweather Group.

18:36.063 --> 18:38.697
Or whatever the fuck it's called.

18:38.732 --> 18:43.136
Most of whom have slept
with the Rainmaker;

18:43.170 --> 18:46.572
Marco Pelios...

18:48.107 --> 18:52.611
our fearless leader...

18:52.645 --> 18:58.451
and, <i>and</i> quiet driver
of the hostile takeover.

18:58.485 --> 19:00.720
Vroom-vroom.

19:02.756 --> 19:04.958
I know I did...

19:04.992 --> 19:09.163
sleep with him.

19:11.333 --> 19:15.303
Especially when he promised

19:15.338 --> 19:19.007
my fast rise to partner.

19:23.878 --> 19:28.114
Didn't you all feel special,
too?

19:29.383 --> 19:30.650
Ladies?

20:07.857 --> 20:09.725
Oh, come on...

20:13.363 --> 20:19.534
So, dude, mad props for all
of this boning and betraying

20:19.569 --> 20:24.672
while still managing to do
quite a bit of business.

20:29.678 --> 20:31.479
You are Slutticus!

20:33.181 --> 20:36.350
There's, like, 20 complainants.

20:36.384 --> 20:38.052
Yeah, it's a Fuckapalooza,
Kenny.

20:38.086 --> 20:40.887
Oh, seriously, it's a
boner bonanza for the Rainmaker.

20:40.922 --> 20:43.223
All right, yes, yes,
Greg, I hear you.

20:43.257 --> 20:45.591
Two years of bad PR, at least.

20:45.626 --> 20:47.860
It's a goddamn deal breaker.

20:47.895 --> 20:50.662
Tell him to turn this
son of a bitch around!

20:53.599 --> 20:56.501
He turned the plane around.

20:56.535 --> 20:59.370
The merger's dead! Namaste!

21:04.911 --> 21:09.148
It's stunning, really...

21:10.985 --> 21:16.756
...how something as simple as
man's desire for pussy can undo

21:16.791 --> 21:21.427
entire civilizations...

21:21.461 --> 21:24.229
or even hostile takeovers.

21:26.432 --> 21:28.967
Good-bye, you scary
motherfucker.

21:32.571 --> 21:34.472
Oh, Marty!

21:36.175 --> 21:38.243
Gotta hand it to you, man.

21:38.277 --> 21:40.378
You fucked me good.
No!

21:40.413 --> 21:42.281
Oh, yes!
Marco, I did not fuck you.

21:42.315 --> 21:43.649
This is just getting even.

21:43.683 --> 21:46.985
Oh! Your daughter,
her I fucked good.

21:47.020 --> 21:48.587
I think it was pretty good.

21:48.622 --> 21:50.122
She was screaming a lot.

21:50.157 --> 21:53.159
Courtney? Rose tattoo
on her ass cheek?

21:53.194 --> 21:55.262
Motherfucker...
There you go.

21:55.296 --> 21:57.564
You son of a bitch mother...!
Oh, shit!

22:02.202 --> 22:04.403
Are you...?
We need to...

22:04.438 --> 22:06.405
What?

22:06.440 --> 22:07.673
Um...

22:07.707 --> 22:09.841
Are you...?
Fuck.

22:09.876 --> 22:10.909
What?

22:10.943 --> 22:12.644
I...
For me...

22:12.679 --> 22:15.013
...have been feeling
very insecure.

22:15.047 --> 22:17.081
Uh-huh.

22:17.116 --> 22:19.317
Um, join six billion
other people.

22:19.351 --> 22:21.453
I, uh...

22:21.487 --> 22:26.825
I've been insecure
and... dishonest.

22:26.860 --> 22:29.595
Oh, Christ, are we gonna have one of
these kinda talks where every...?

22:29.629 --> 22:33.300
And I... I have
been behaving badly.

22:33.334 --> 22:35.869
Well, that-that doesn't sound
like a, uh, a good sign.

22:35.904 --> 22:38.206
And I'm not ready
to get married.

22:38.240 --> 22:41.508
Or be engaged, or live with you.
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Oh. Wh...

22:41.543 --> 22:44.645
Seriously?

22:44.679 --> 22:48.349
But I really like being
with you.

22:48.384 --> 22:50.786
"I like being with you"?

22:50.820 --> 22:52.354
"I like being..."?

22:54.558 --> 22:56.392
That's really sweet and all,

22:56.426 --> 22:59.395
you know, your whole struggle
that you're going through.

22:59.429 --> 23:03.165
Truthfully, for me,
I'm not that surprised by it.

23:03.200 --> 23:06.569
I kind of always saw
you as my B plan.

23:06.603 --> 23:08.070
Do we really think

23:08.105 --> 23:10.539
that my parents were ever
gonna sign off on

23:10.573 --> 23:14.209
a beauty queen runner-up
from Spokane?

23:14.243 --> 23:16.812
My family owns
a fucking baseball team.

23:16.846 --> 23:19.882
That's what they do for fun.

23:19.916 --> 23:22.318
Your family...

23:22.352 --> 23:25.388
Right.

23:25.423 --> 23:27.891
So fuck you...

23:27.925 --> 23:32.095
and your little
existential problems.

23:45.743 --> 23:48.545
Don't sell yourself short.

23:48.579 --> 23:50.914
Oh, I...
I was your A plan.

23:50.949 --> 23:53.917
And I messed up.

24:05.595 --> 24:06.929
Hey.

24:10.133 --> 24:11.799
It's a crazy-ass
night, man.

24:15.137 --> 24:17.104
You going somewhere?

24:23.412 --> 24:24.946
Where's Roscoe?

24:24.980 --> 24:27.148
He went to stay
with his mother.

24:27.183 --> 24:30.785
He didn't mention anything
to me about a sleepover.

24:30.820 --> 24:32.120
No, Marty,

24:32.155 --> 24:36.592
he went to stay with Monica...

24:36.626 --> 24:39.962
for the foreseeable future.

24:39.996 --> 24:43.800
What'd he...?
Did he say something to you?

24:43.834 --> 24:50.407
He said... you made him feel
like the Mayans were right.

24:54.780 --> 24:58.115
Well, I don't give a shit, okay?

24:58.150 --> 25:01.451
She can't just take him, Dad.

25:01.486 --> 25:04.454
She can't. We haven't even had
the custody hearing yet.

25:04.488 --> 25:06.589
No, no, Marty, she
didn't take him.

25:06.623 --> 25:07.857
He went.

25:10.227 --> 25:14.163
Well, he can't.

25:14.197 --> 25:15.497
He can't.

25:15.532 --> 25:18.634
I don't give a...
He can't fucking do that.

25:18.668 --> 25:20.803
I'm-I'm gonna get a court order.
Marty.

25:20.837 --> 25:22.004
What?

25:22.039 --> 25:24.674
You gotta let him play
this one out.

25:24.708 --> 25:27.978
You got to.

25:28.012 --> 25:29.679
I'm gonna go, uh...

25:32.217 --> 25:33.451
...spend some time at my condo,

25:33.485 --> 25:37.155
give you some space, hmm?

25:38.424 --> 25:40.959
Dad...

25:40.993 --> 25:43.495
I don't want space.

25:47.767 --> 25:51.002
Yeah, well...

25:51.037 --> 25:53.205
I'm gonna give you some anyway.

25:53.239 --> 25:56.175
I'm sorry, son.

26:10.424 --> 26:13.927
So you blew up your
life for the job, huh?

26:13.961 --> 26:17.597
You blow up your life every day
for the job.

26:19.267 --> 26:22.403
That's true, I guess.

26:22.437 --> 26:25.740
Does that mean one day
I'll be like you?

26:25.774 --> 26:27.876
One day.

26:27.910 --> 26:30.611
Girl, you are already like me.

26:33.114 --> 26:35.582
Well, I'm gonna take
that as a compliment,

26:35.616 --> 26:37.951
knowing what a high opinion
you have of yourself.

26:37.985 --> 26:39.386
How else could you take it?

26:42.257 --> 26:44.024
Hey-hey-hey!

26:44.058 --> 26:45.725
Hey-hey-hey!
Are we doing shots?

26:45.760 --> 26:47.294
Who wants to do some shots?

26:47.328 --> 26:49.329
Shots, shots, shots.

26:51.633 --> 26:54.601
To the blower-uppers.

26:54.636 --> 26:58.439
To the motherfucking
blower-uppers.

27:16.592 --> 27:18.093
Come on.
Pour me one.
