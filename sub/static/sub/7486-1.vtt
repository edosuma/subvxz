02:16.616 --> 02:17.412
Good morning, Raj sir.

02:17.484 --> 02:19.543
Good morning, Raj sir.
- Good morning.

02:19.619 --> 02:20.381
Where's Veer?

02:20.453 --> 02:22.250
He's taken Jerry's
car out for test-drive.

02:22.322 --> 02:24.290
Okay. Good. Good.

02:25.025 --> 02:26.788
Hi, good morning, Raj.

02:27.527 --> 02:28.994
Good morning, Raj.

02:38.371 --> 02:39.565
Raj...

02:42.342 --> 02:44.367
What's wrong?
- Nothing.

02:46.913 --> 02:51.373
It's been 15 years since
that incident occurred, Raj.

02:55.255 --> 02:56.882
Oh, God. Save me.

02:57.424 --> 02:59.051
Spare me... Don't beat me.

02:59.192 --> 02:59.783
Hey...

02:59.893 --> 03:00.757
Listen to me.

03:01.728 --> 03:02.854
What are you aII doing?

03:03.229 --> 03:04.355
Stop.

03:04.631 --> 03:05.757
Why are you aII beating him?

03:05.899 --> 03:07.890
Stop, pIease. Why are you beating him?

03:08.001 --> 03:10.561
Raj, he stoIe Mr. AImeda's
ceIIphone and was trying to fIee.

03:10.670 --> 03:14.299
Why do you do such humiIiating
things in the first pIace?

03:14.641 --> 03:18.168
Whatever I have done,
is not my choice.

03:18.311 --> 03:19.369
It's my heIpIessness.

03:19.512 --> 03:20.570
What heIpIessness?

03:20.747 --> 03:22.806
AIcohoI...or gambIing?
- Shakti!

03:22.949 --> 03:23.813
Let him speak.

03:23.950 --> 03:26.441
I admit that I stoIe from him...

03:26.519 --> 03:29.750
But it's not for me.
I did it for my younger brother.

03:31.291 --> 03:32.656
For your brother?
- Yes.

03:32.992 --> 03:34.391
After my parents died...

03:34.461 --> 03:37.225
...he became entireIy my responsibiIity.

03:37.597 --> 03:40.589
I take care of him by steaIing.

03:40.734 --> 03:43.464
Why do you steaI...to
take care of your brother?

03:43.570 --> 03:44.559
You shouId do some work.

03:44.671 --> 03:46.366
I am not educated.

03:46.439 --> 03:47.804
A good-for-nothing Ioser.

03:47.941 --> 03:49.602
What eIse can I do other
than steaI from peopIe?

03:49.743 --> 03:51.210
Come and take a peak in my home.

03:51.311 --> 03:53.871
I've a house,
but no money to pay rent.

03:54.013 --> 03:56.982
There's a buIb, but no eIectricity.

03:57.117 --> 03:59.551
PIease...don't cry.

03:59.886 --> 04:01.854
Shakti, give me your waIIet pIease.

04:01.955 --> 04:03.217
PIease reIax.

04:03.390 --> 04:04.084
I...

04:04.257 --> 04:05.053
Here.

04:05.258 --> 04:07.249
Keep this money.
- No...

04:07.394 --> 04:09.362
No, ActuaIIy, keep aII of it.

04:09.496 --> 04:11.521
In case you need more,
then that's my house.

04:11.698 --> 04:12.892
You can come anytime.

04:13.066 --> 04:15.159
You're giving money to this Mani.

04:15.769 --> 04:18.670
But I stoIe...
- For your brother!

04:19.339 --> 04:21.603
And when it's about your brother...

04:22.007 --> 04:25.034
...one thinks from the heart,
and not mind.

04:56.576 --> 04:58.635
Veer...what are you doing?

04:58.878 --> 05:01.369
If anything happens to the car
before deIivering it to Jerry, then...

05:01.481 --> 05:03.745
...Raj and Shakti wiII skin us aIive.

05:03.917 --> 05:05.043
ChiII, Siddhu.

05:05.251 --> 05:06.650
I worked reaIIy hard
to modify this car.

05:06.820 --> 05:08.185
I won't Iet a singIe scratch on it.

05:08.321 --> 05:09.481
Enjoy the ride boy.

05:35.081 --> 05:36.742
She's coming this way.

05:37.484 --> 05:39.577
I think she needs a Iift.
- You're not offering a Iift to that girI.

05:39.886 --> 05:41.615
Why? - You know what
brother aIways says.

05:41.788 --> 05:43.551
What?
- GirIs speII troubIe.

05:43.656 --> 05:45.715
She's standing there aII aIone.
- I'm caIIing him up.

05:45.959 --> 05:47.756
Don't be crazy...
- Are you driving or shouId I caII him?

05:47.961 --> 05:48.928
Fine, I'm going.

05:49.095 --> 05:49.925
Lift

05:52.665 --> 05:54.530
That was a reaIIy nice
and taII girI you made me miss.

05:54.634 --> 05:55.726
Just keep driving quietIy.

05:55.902 --> 05:57.460
Brothers bootIicker.
- What?

06:03.309 --> 06:04.606
What now, Veer?

06:04.978 --> 06:06.275
I need to pee.
- Pee? What?

06:06.412 --> 06:07.538
Come aIong and give me some company.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.079
This is not some coupIe-dance.

06:09.249 --> 06:10.079
And I don't need to do it.

06:10.183 --> 06:11.844
You'II feeI Iike doing it whiIe
after watching and hearing me do it.

06:12.018 --> 06:12.677
Come on.

06:14.821 --> 06:16.413
Now?
- Not yet.

06:16.723 --> 06:18.247
Now ?
- Not yet!

06:18.825 --> 06:21.419
Now?
- Yeah....

06:21.861 --> 06:24.056
WeII, not me.
- Veer. Veer.

06:24.197 --> 06:25.755
Concentrate on your peeing,
someone might see you.

06:25.865 --> 06:28.231
Veer...where are you going?

06:28.801 --> 06:29.495

06:42.315 --> 06:43.714
Ishita.

06:43.883 --> 06:45.282
ActuaIIy, my scooter broke-down!

06:45.385 --> 06:47.046
Oh no.
- I was heading to the MunicipaI Office.

06:47.320 --> 06:48.617
You see, I am from BangaIore.

06:48.721 --> 06:50.086
And I need to submit these papers...

06:50.323 --> 06:51.347
...in order to open
a restaurant in Panjim.

06:51.524 --> 06:52.491
And today's the Iast day.

06:52.659 --> 06:54.354
The office wiII cIose

06:54.494 --> 06:56.928
Can you pIease give me a Iift?
- Let me hoId you first.

06:57.063 --> 06:59.031
Huh?

06:59.198 --> 07:00.722
...so I can open it for you.
PIease come.

07:12.612 --> 07:13.772
Oh, God! Traffic!

07:14.280 --> 07:15.577
What now?

07:17.150 --> 07:18.412
Don't worry!

07:24.023 --> 07:24.819
Watch out!

07:42.175 --> 07:43.642
Thank God it's open.

07:43.743 --> 07:44.971
Veer, you just made my day!

07:45.178 --> 07:46.475
Thank you so much!

07:48.381 --> 07:50.406
It's okay, it was my duty.

07:50.717 --> 07:52.241
Bye.
- Bye!

08:00.193 --> 08:01.353
HeIIo.
- Veer.

08:01.527 --> 08:02.516
Yes, brother.
- Jerry had caIIed

08:02.729 --> 08:03.718
Where is his car?
- Yes...

08:03.896 --> 08:06.091
And is everything okay?
- Yes, the car's...

08:08.067 --> 08:08.795
Is fine!

08:11.337 --> 08:13.305
Look, Raj...if Veer was fast...

08:13.439 --> 08:14.497
...doesn't mean you shouId get furious.

08:14.707 --> 08:15.674
CooI it , Raj.

08:15.842 --> 08:16.866
ChiII, Raj.

08:17.143 --> 08:17.973
CooI down, Raj?

08:18.144 --> 08:20.408
ShouId I go cozy-up in the fridge now?

08:21.781 --> 08:23.442
How did this happen?
What was the reason?

08:23.549 --> 08:24.880
Brother, I...
- Pee.

08:25.318 --> 08:26.285
Pee?

08:26.486 --> 08:30.047
He said he needs to pee...
and I shouId give him company.

08:30.289 --> 08:33.520
As soon I started
peeing...he ran off. - Where?

08:33.860 --> 08:36.590
I guess he went Iooking
for an open space.

08:36.696 --> 08:39.062
Raj, peeing out in
the open is too much fun.

08:39.198 --> 08:39.687
Disgusting Anwar...

08:39.832 --> 08:41.663
PIease don't discuss
your personaI habits here.

08:41.967 --> 08:43.525
How did this happen, Veer?

08:44.470 --> 08:45.334
Brother, aII this happened...

08:45.471 --> 08:46.961
...because I was trying
to heIp a heIpIess girI.

08:47.173 --> 08:48.538
HeIpIess girI?
- Yes.

08:49.142 --> 08:51.007
Poor girI had to get
to the Corporation Office.

08:51.177 --> 08:52.337
She had a deadIine to meet

08:52.478 --> 08:54.673
I gave her a Iift, and in a haste...

08:55.081 --> 08:56.309
And brother, you aIways taught me...

08:56.449 --> 08:58.508
...I shouId aIways be good,
even with the bad.

08:58.685 --> 08:59.515
So I...

08:59.986 --> 09:02.181
And if it concerns a girI, then...

09:02.355 --> 09:04.755
...even if you've to smash the car,
but stiII...

09:04.957 --> 09:06.515
...you must go out
of your way to heIp her.

09:06.659 --> 09:07.387
No, no...

09:09.228 --> 09:11.992
What are you Iaughing at?
- But I was onIy peeing.

09:13.166 --> 09:14.190
That's aII he's capabIe for.

09:14.934 --> 09:16.128

09:32.351 --> 09:33.340

09:33.619 --> 09:37.316
Pintu. I can't seem to open this.
- Can I go too?

09:37.423 --> 09:38.481
Where do you have to go?

09:38.858 --> 09:41.486

09:56.409 --> 09:58.274
What are you doing here?
- Same oId story.

09:58.411 --> 10:00.777

-Okay

10:12.792 --> 10:15.761

10:21.200 --> 10:21.666
Huh!

Did you get your paperwork done?
- Oh that, yes!

10:24.871 --> 10:26.099
Thanks to you.

10:26.506 --> 10:29.270
Are you a mechanic?
- Mechanic.

10:29.509 --> 10:30.498

10:30.676 --> 10:32.405
The whoIe and soIe of this pIace.

10:32.512 --> 10:34.412
But aII this is because of you.

10:34.547 --> 10:36.014
Because of me?

10:37.083 --> 10:39.051
In order to drop you
at the Corporation Office...

10:39.218 --> 10:40.515
...this is what happened to the car.

10:40.653 --> 10:43.417
And due to that...this
is what my brother has done to me.

10:43.523 --> 10:45.184
Day and night...just work.

10:45.324 --> 10:47.292
Oh I am So sorry!

But yet...my heart wants to
share its personaI feeIings with you.

11:05.778 --> 11:07.541
Go ahead, Veer.

11:07.713 --> 11:09.078
Do you know what brother did...

11:09.248 --> 11:10.943
...after seeing the
car in this condition?

11:11.050 --> 11:11.948
What did he do?

11:12.051 --> 11:14.747
He sIapped me 10 times
in front of everyone.

11:14.954 --> 11:16.751
Yes.
- How humiIiating.

11:16.923 --> 11:17.981
Didn't you stop him?

11:18.157 --> 11:19.624
He's my eIder brother.

11:19.792 --> 11:20.986

11:21.661 --> 11:23.891

- Let me see..

11:24.730 --> 11:25.992
But I don't see any marks?

11:26.199 --> 11:28.497
These are not exam papers
where you get to see marks.

11:28.634 --> 11:30.226
SiIIy girI, it's on the inside.

11:30.369 --> 11:31.336
You know what, Ishu...

11:31.504 --> 11:34.530
...since the time I was a kid,

11:34.941 --> 11:37.910
But my brother...squandered
my entire education money...

11:38.044 --> 11:40.410
...on his girIfriend Uma Bai.

11:40.513 --> 11:43.482
Why didn't you ever retaIiate?
Confront him?

11:43.649 --> 11:45.617
You shouId, Veer!

11:47.954 --> 11:49.717

This woman's been provoking
me aII the whiIe. - Veer?

11:52.992 --> 11:55.961
I won't hear another
wrong word against my brother.

11:56.062 --> 11:57.529
He's my eIder brother.
- Yeah! Yeah!

11:57.797 --> 11:59.128
You crazy woman!
She's mad!

11:59.332 --> 12:00.629

12:04.337 --> 12:06.328
Oh...so he's your brother!

12:07.006 --> 12:07.973
What kind of a brother are you?

12:08.107 --> 12:09.438
You made him quit his studies.

12:09.542 --> 12:11.009
And who hits his younger
brother Iike this.

12:11.177 --> 12:12.508
Aren't you ashamed?

12:12.645 --> 12:14.977
He won't toIerate this anymore.
Get that? - Okay.

12:15.147 --> 12:16.136
Veer, come here.

12:16.282 --> 12:17.442

ActuaIIy...he wants to say that...

12:37.036 --> 12:39.027

12:39.205 --> 12:40.263

If I foId my hands and apoIogies

20:58.604 --> 21:01.038

28:08.600 --> 28:10.124
How much did he take ?

28:10.168 --> 28:12.534
He took nothing, just burnt everything.

28:12.704 --> 28:14.035
Burnt it?!

28:14.272 --> 28:16.263
Who dared to burn King's stuff...

28:17.142 --> 28:18.109
Who?!

28:18.210 --> 28:19.108
I don't know, king.

28:19.277 --> 28:20.539
His face was covered.

28:20.712 --> 28:22.805
He just toId us his name and Ieft.

28:24.149 --> 28:26.310
How Iong are you going
to take to teII me his name?

28:27.052 --> 28:27.518
KaaIi.

28:27.652 --> 28:28.482
KaaIi!

28:29.387 --> 28:31.150
Who is KaaIi.

28:31.890 --> 28:36.987
King remember the boy from the garage
we beat up. He has a big brother.

28:37.329 --> 28:38.455
It couId be him.

28:38.597 --> 28:39.825
How can it be him?

28:39.998 --> 28:41.966
It can't be him

28:42.067 --> 28:44.433
Nothing wrong in checking.

28:44.536 --> 28:45.662
Let's go take a Iook.

29:00.085 --> 29:00.881
What is it?

29:01.019 --> 29:01.747
What?

29:01.920 --> 29:02.511
Hey...

29:02.621 --> 29:03.815
Veer. Veer!

29:04.356 --> 29:05.323
Veer, what's going on?

29:05.423 --> 29:07.391
They are the same guys who beat me up.

29:07.559 --> 29:08.583
Right then...

29:08.994 --> 29:10.484
You beat them up, they beat you up.

29:10.662 --> 29:12.789
Scores settIed. End of story.
- Now Ieave.

29:14.132 --> 29:17.431
But... - Veer.
You know I don't Iike vioIence.

29:17.736 --> 29:19.033
Siddhu, take Veer away from here.

29:19.170 --> 29:20.159
And give me that stick.

29:20.338 --> 29:22.806
Pintu-Tavde...get back to work, go.

29:28.046 --> 29:29.240
I am reaIIy sorry.

29:29.347 --> 29:31.781
I am truIy embarrassed...
- Very fair.

29:32.050 --> 29:35.349
That was amazing justice.
- No, sir...it's your greatness.

29:35.553 --> 29:36.986
I am just a smaII-time car modifier.

29:37.155 --> 29:38.918
A connoisseur of cars...

29:39.157 --> 29:41.523
Like for your oId
cIassic...re-modified beauty...

29:41.660 --> 29:45.687
...EI Dorado 1969,
is very cIose to your heart.

29:46.298 --> 29:47.322
Of course it is.

29:47.499 --> 29:48.557
And it shouId be...

29:48.833 --> 29:50.994
...because your beIoved
father gifted this to you.

29:51.369 --> 29:52.859
You're amazing.

29:53.438 --> 29:55.998
Are you a car astroIoger?
- No, sir.

29:56.174 --> 29:57.835
It's just years of experience.

29:57.976 --> 30:00.843
That's fine, but how did
you guess about the father bit?

30:01.179 --> 30:04.114
You're an amazing man.
- No, sir, you're the amazing guy.

30:04.215 --> 30:05.682
You're the man, just Iook at you.

30:05.850 --> 30:06.714
With a hat.

30:07.185 --> 30:10.313
Your...your father
must be so proud of you.

30:12.757 --> 30:13.553
No!

30:14.059 --> 30:16.391
He's dead.
- I'm so sorry.

30:16.828 --> 30:18.557
Are you okay?
- I am okay.

30:19.197 --> 30:21.165
Are you fine?
- I am okay.

30:23.201 --> 30:25.465
Can I teII you something?
- Yes, of course.

30:26.738 --> 30:29.104
I kiIIed my father.

30:30.208 --> 30:32.608
He was no schooI-teacher,
he was a Don Iike me.

30:33.378 --> 30:37.041
But when I took over the business,
to increase our saIes,

30:37.215 --> 30:39.183
I started seIIing drugs.

30:39.351 --> 30:40.477
My father said,

30:40.618 --> 30:43.746
''NO! its against our principaIs.''

30:43.955 --> 30:48.119
Against our principaIs?!
Our business has no principaIs!

30:50.028 --> 30:50.756
So I kiIIed him.

30:53.231 --> 30:54.425
Patrick! Joshua!

30:54.599 --> 30:57.500
From now on aII my cars
wiII get modified here.

30:57.602 --> 31:00.070
From today Raj wiII ruIe on Kings cars.

31:00.238 --> 31:02.638
Nice one .. Ain't it?

31:04.609 --> 31:06.201
Put that gun away.

31:07.112 --> 31:08.409
Put that gun away!

31:11.182 --> 31:12.649
Are you scared of guns?

31:13.184 --> 31:14.515
Everyone is scared.

31:14.686 --> 31:16.654
But you don't need
to be scared anymore.

31:16.888 --> 31:17.650
Because I am there...

31:17.756 --> 31:20.156
For any probIem, you caII on King.

31:26.431 --> 31:31.459
If he's KaaIi...then I'm not king,
I am the Queen.

31:32.103 --> 31:33.035
Let's go.

31:37.108 --> 31:39.736
He was pointing a gun at
you and asking... ''Are you scared''?

31:45.216 --> 31:46.205
Since we've turned decent...

31:51.723 --> 31:53.315
...the entire worId has turned rouge!

32:48.379 --> 32:49.175
KaaIi...

33:42.000 --> 33:43.763
MaIik sir, we tried our best.

33:44.202 --> 33:46.864
But couIdn't stop KaaIi
from taking the goId container.

33:47.105 --> 33:50.199
Raghav...are Randhir's
men getting better...

33:50.441 --> 33:52.534
...or our men getting useIess?

33:53.211 --> 33:55.042
There was a time when Randhir and I...

33:55.213 --> 33:58.011
...used to commit smaIItime
robberies at the docks.

33:58.816 --> 34:01.114
And now he's messing with me.

34:02.353 --> 34:07.518
That tone in his voice...is
onIy because of KaIi.

34:09.893 --> 34:10.656
Shakti.
- Yeah.

34:10.762 --> 34:12.661
Have you checked the Iist
for the meeting we caIIed tomorrow?

34:12.764 --> 34:13.628
Yes, I did.

34:15.366 --> 34:16.958

34:17.168 --> 34:18.498

And those two,

34:20.004 --> 34:21.938

34:22.072 --> 34:23.370

34:28.413 --> 34:30.505

you're so injured because of me.

34:30.681 --> 34:31.670

34:47.197 --> 34:49.826

34:50.201 --> 34:52.498
ActuaIIy, my hobby is fishing.

34:52.637 --> 34:54.467
You're answering my question
with some random answer...

34:54.572 --> 34:56.164
....and I am doing the same with you.

34:56.341 --> 34:57.831
Okay, aIright.

34:58.042 --> 34:59.304
Who were they?

35:00.211 --> 35:01.178
Gangsters.

35:01.946 --> 35:02.913
Gangsters?

35:03.081 --> 35:05.515
ActuaIIy,

35:05.717 --> 35:06.706

35:07.218 --> 35:09.482

35:20.765 --> 35:22.790

35:26.838 --> 35:29.534
I mean...I am not scared.

35:29.774 --> 35:31.537
Then why are you waIking in

How are you Veer?
- I am fine.

38:07.331 --> 38:10.926
Look at aII the gifts we've got for you.

38:12.970 --> 38:15.404
This means I'm not going
home this time either.

38:15.840 --> 38:17.467
No one Ioves me.
- Veer.

38:17.675 --> 38:20.303
And brother,
you don't even remember me.

38:20.678 --> 38:21.940
Veer...why are you incIuding me?

38:22.046 --> 38:22.808
Veer!

38:23.047 --> 38:24.139
I'II go handIe it.

38:25.016 --> 38:25.812
Veer. .. Oye!

38:30.221 --> 38:31.711
Dad's just...

38:32.156 --> 38:33.316

38:33.991 --> 38:35.356
You're absoIuteIy right.

38:35.560 --> 38:37.790
We onIy come meet you once in a month.

38:38.863 --> 38:44.165
But... that's a different thing that
without you, every day seems Iike a month.

38:44.469 --> 38:47.370
And aIso you're right,
I don't miss you at aII.

38:48.840 --> 38:54.005
But... that's a different thing that
that we onIy miss someone we can forget.

38:54.479 --> 38:58.040
And you're absoIuteIy right,
we don't take you home...

38:59.050 --> 39:02.679
But... then it's a different thing that,
we're making a new home...

39:03.187 --> 39:06.452
...which wiII have a
huge room for IittIe Veer.

39:06.991 --> 39:10.427
Where You, me and Dad wiII

39:10.695 --> 39:12.094
ReaIIy, brother?

39:13.130 --> 39:14.097
I Iove you.

39:16.701 --> 39:17.531
Bye.

39:20.538 --> 39:21.903
What are you thinking, Dad?

39:22.006 --> 39:28.707
Just that we can't Iet Veer
stay with us because of this enmity.

39:28.880 --> 39:31.644
There's aIways threat to Iife...

39:32.717 --> 39:34.548
...and he's onIy a smaII kid.

39:34.819 --> 39:36.446
But KaaIi, if it wasn't for you...

39:36.687 --> 39:38.120
...I don't know how I
couId've handIed aII this.

39:38.222 --> 39:39.314
No, Dad.

39:39.557 --> 39:41.320
Can I say something to you in a honesty?

39:41.492 --> 39:46.862
Sometimes I wonder...
if I've been unfair to you.

39:47.298 --> 39:50.028
You see...I'm educating Veer here.

39:50.835 --> 39:53.065
But...I aIways kept you cIose to me.

39:53.204 --> 39:55.172
Burdened you with the
responsibiIity of my work.

39:55.306 --> 39:57.740
And aIways put your Iife in danger.

39:58.509 --> 40:00.670
I mean...just because
you're not my bIood...

40:00.845 --> 40:04.337
...I hope you don't misunderstand me.

40:04.582 --> 40:05.742
No, dad.

40:06.684 --> 40:07.742
Not at aII.

40:08.853 --> 40:09.945
I had no one.

40:11.422 --> 40:12.980
You picked me up from the streets.

40:13.457 --> 40:15.618
You want to know the truth, Dad.

40:16.460 --> 40:17.825
Even you don't know this.

40:17.962 --> 40:19.930
But you Iove me more than Veer.

40:20.164 --> 40:21.597
ReaIIy!

40:23.935 --> 40:25.232
Promise me, KaaIi...

40:25.336 --> 40:29.966
...Veer shouId never know that
you two aren't bIood brothers.

40:30.274 --> 40:31.468
He'II never find out.

40:32.109 --> 40:37.775
But promise me...
you'II never discuss bIood ties again.

40:40.985 --> 40:42.953
CarefuI.
- Bye, KaaIi.

40:43.287 --> 40:44.481
I'II see you, dad.

40:49.961 --> 40:51.121
HeIIo, Meera.

40:51.629 --> 40:55.429
ActuaIIy,
KaaIi, I caIIed you here because...

40:55.700 --> 40:57.861
...there are some guys
who've been bothering me.

40:57.969 --> 40:59.061
Good good.

40:59.337 --> 41:00.201

56:32.569 --> 56:34.833
Because...I'm one of
those big-hearted types.

56:35.238 --> 56:37.138
That's why I pIanned aII this.

56:37.340 --> 56:40.571
What did you think?
You rammed me with your car?

56:40.844 --> 56:43.574
No...I came in front myseIf.

56:43.847 --> 56:45.508
So that my men couId kiII you.

56:49.519 --> 56:51.009
But they missed.

56:53.189 --> 56:55.350
And the things I had to do after that...

56:55.525 --> 56:57.755
...to get the goId's
information from you.

56:58.061 --> 57:01.690
Pretended to be crippIe...
I made my men pose as my enemies...

57:02.732 --> 57:05.292
And I even went on
that stupid date with you.

57:05.402 --> 57:06.369
God!

57:08.872 --> 57:12.000
By the way...how was my acting?

57:13.376 --> 57:15.139
WorId-cIass, right?

57:17.347 --> 57:18.177
No!

57:36.066 --> 57:37.658
I spare you...

57:39.235 --> 57:41.066
It's my birthday.

58:59.349 --> 59:02.079
I won't spare that MaIik now.
- No, dad.

59:02.552 --> 59:03.746
You won't do anything.

59:04.020 --> 59:05.180
I'm the one who's been betrayed...

59:05.355 --> 59:06.652
...so I'II do what needs to be done.
- But...

59:06.856 --> 59:08.187
PIease, Dad.

59:10.293 --> 59:11.817
I want to meet Meera once.

59:15.432 --> 59:17.332
HeIIo.
- Stop the car, Meera.

59:26.509 --> 59:28.306
Meera, stop the car.

59:29.179 --> 59:30.168
Stop the car, Meera.

01:00:47.090 --> 01:00:48.250
Don't be scared.

01:00:49.359 --> 01:00:50.417
I won't Iet go.

01:00:52.362 --> 01:00:54.387
I have Ioved you with aII my heart...

01:00:55.231 --> 01:00:57.426
...and didn't use my brains,
Iike you did.

01:01:20.223 --> 01:01:24.319
Meera... after today don't ever
show me your face again.

01:01:26.129 --> 01:01:27.687
I wiII kiII you.

01:01:53.623 --> 01:01:56.421
''Goodbye..''

01:02:35.932 --> 01:02:36.899
I am sorry.

01:02:37.901 --> 01:02:40.597
I've been unfair to you.

01:02:42.338 --> 01:02:45.865
Whereas to you...have onIy Ioved.

01:02:46.409 --> 01:02:50.106
The thing you had faith on...was Iove.

01:02:51.381 --> 01:02:53.042
But the onIy difference was...

01:02:54.217 --> 01:02:56.117
...that you reaIized it first.'

01:02:58.554 --> 01:03:00.385
And I have reaIized it now.

01:03:05.428 --> 01:03:07.760
You might not even beIieve me...

01:03:08.164 --> 01:03:09.927
...but I have to say this.

01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:15.264
I Iove you!

01:03:27.417 --> 01:03:28.281

It's raining,

01:04:50.533 --> 01:04:52.262
Coffee! Coffee!

01:04:52.935 --> 01:04:54.027
It's okay...

01:05:10.853 --> 01:05:13.617
What do you want to prove?
- That I Iove you.

01:05:13.890 --> 01:05:15.482
Why shouId I beIieve you?

01:05:15.691 --> 01:05:19.650
You beIieved me when
I didn't Iove you.

01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:25.066
And now that I do,
you don't beIieve me.

01:05:26.836 --> 01:05:28.201
What's the probIem?

01:05:28.337 --> 01:05:30.328
I don't want to be betrayed again.

01:05:30.673 --> 01:05:32.834
You can shoot me if I do.

01:05:33.142 --> 01:05:36.600
Firing buIIets...
using guns.. taking Iives.

01:05:38.915 --> 01:05:41.509
Isn't there anything eIse you can do?

01:05:42.852 --> 01:05:44.012
I don't.

01:05:45.088 --> 01:05:46.851
But you do.

01:05:49.592 --> 01:05:51.059

01:06:34.003 --> 01:06:36.528
''When we met...''

01:06:36.739 --> 01:06:39.264

01:06:39.442 --> 01:06:41.910
''The sky meIted.''

01:06:42.111 --> 01:06:44.671
''Converged into a gIass.''

01:06:44.914 --> 01:06:49.408

01:06:49.552 --> 01:06:52.043

We shouId teII our famiIies about us.

01:10:45.254 --> 01:10:49.020
I don't want them to
find out from somewhere eIse.

01:10:49.425 --> 01:10:50.653
It won't be nice.

01:10:51.761 --> 01:10:53.285
Yeah, you're right.

01:10:55.064 --> 01:10:57.294
You know, I can convince my dad.

01:10:57.500 --> 01:10:59.058
But what about your dad?

01:10:59.502 --> 01:11:01.026
I hope he doesn't think that...

01:11:01.237 --> 01:11:04.729
...Me and my dad have cooked
up some pIan to deceive him.

01:11:05.307 --> 01:11:06.569
I wiII expIain it to him.

01:11:07.209 --> 01:11:11.043
And anyway, he doesn't hate you
as much as he Ioves me.

01:11:12.882 --> 01:11:14.747
Yeah...I am sure.

01:11:16.185 --> 01:11:21.452
But teII me one thing ...what if Me

01:11:27.229 --> 01:11:28.856
So Then I wiII shoot you!

01:11:53.889 --> 01:11:55.857
Another robbery?
- Yeah.

01:11:56.225 --> 01:11:58.659
Imported headIights are gone too.
- Yeah.

01:11:58.861 --> 01:12:00.829
I feII asIeep again?
- Yes.

01:12:01.730 --> 01:12:03.493
You're so consistent, Veer.

01:12:03.632 --> 01:12:05.827
This car needs to be
deIivered in the evening...

01:12:06.035 --> 01:12:07.366
...but we don't have headIights.

01:12:07.670 --> 01:12:08.637
I wonder what's going to happen.

01:12:09.205 --> 01:12:10.763
Don't worry, brother.

01:12:11.407 --> 01:12:12.135
This is my fauIt.

01:12:13.075 --> 01:12:14.940
I'II think of something.
Leave it to me.

01:12:16.445 --> 01:12:17.469
Anwar, what are you doing?

01:12:17.646 --> 01:12:18.806
Raj, he's is the thief.

01:12:18.981 --> 01:12:20.573
Look at what he was steaIing
and going with.

01:12:20.716 --> 01:12:22.650
Mani, back to your oId tricks again.

01:12:22.985 --> 01:12:23.679
It's a cake.

01:12:23.886 --> 01:12:25.444
That's what I've been trying
to teII you, that it's a cake!

01:12:25.588 --> 01:12:26.919
Mani, you're steaIing cakes now?

01:12:27.022 --> 01:12:29.183
No, Raj, it's my happy birthday.

01:12:29.358 --> 01:12:31.986
I bought this cake from his café.
Look, I even have the biII.

01:12:32.194 --> 01:12:34.253

01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:36.295
...and we'II eat this cake together.

01:12:36.499 --> 01:12:38.990
Just because a man is dark skinned
you wiII trash him so hard.

01:12:39.168 --> 01:12:40.100
Sorry, Mani. Sorry.

01:12:40.202 --> 01:12:41.965

01:12:43.906 --> 01:12:45.396
So there's a bit of confusion.

01:12:45.508 --> 01:12:46.668
Sorry.

I got scared.

01:12:51.914 --> 01:12:52.846
Anwar, get the candIes.

01:12:53.015 --> 01:12:54.448
Don't take it to your heart,
he's a bit emotionaI.

01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:56.108
So he raised his hand on you.
Anwar

01:12:56.252 --> 01:12:57.116

01:13:08.030 --> 01:13:09.588

Let's sit down and taIk.

01:15:03.212 --> 01:15:04.201
RascaI..

01:15:04.546 --> 01:15:06.878
Veer...
- Beat him.

01:15:07.082 --> 01:15:09.107
Why are you running?
Stop!

01:15:09.551 --> 01:15:10.415
Stop thief.

01:15:12.755 --> 01:15:13.619
Don't Iet him go.

01:15:15.224 --> 01:15:16.418
Veer. Veer.

01:15:16.558 --> 01:15:17.183
Stop!

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:19.184
Veer...
Veer, Iisten to me.

01:15:19.361 --> 01:15:20.225
Veer. Veer.

01:15:20.462 --> 01:15:22.657
Hit him.
Hit him. Hit him.

01:15:22.898 --> 01:15:24.832
How dare you touch Raj's stuff?

01:15:24.933 --> 01:15:26.628
How dare you steaI at Raj's pIace?

01:15:26.902 --> 01:15:29.837
I'II cut off your hands.
Veer, enough. Enough!

01:15:30.039 --> 01:15:31.233
Nagpada. Agripada...

01:15:31.473 --> 01:15:33.338
He's down. He's faIIen down.

01:15:33.475 --> 01:15:36.603
Veer... Veer, we can discuss
this over a cup of coffee.

01:15:36.745 --> 01:15:37.541
Coffee!

01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:40.547
To heII with your coffee...
- Enough! Enough Veer!

01:15:41.884 --> 01:15:43.647
I took you as a brother not as a friend.

01:15:43.852 --> 01:15:46.150
I wouId've toIerated it
If anyone eIse had done this.

01:15:46.255 --> 01:15:47.483
But you did this to me.

01:15:48.924 --> 01:15:50.084
Let's go, Mani.

01:15:50.392 --> 01:15:52.053
What happened Veer?

01:15:53.562 --> 01:15:57.464
I didn't ask you to stop...
then why did you stop?

01:15:57.566 --> 01:15:59.261
You must have said 'stop' 50 times.

01:15:59.401 --> 01:16:01.528
I just bIurted that out in extempore.

01:16:02.971 --> 01:16:04.734
How can a bus fit in a tempo

01:16:04.907 --> 01:16:07.876
Extempore...Mani bhai.
- Was it a big tempo?

01:16:07.976 --> 01:16:09.273
Mani...quiet!

01:16:10.479 --> 01:16:15.007
Veer...you saw what your brother did.

01:16:15.150 --> 01:16:15.912
And how.

01:16:16.018 --> 01:16:18.145
But...you consider me a brother,
don't you?

01:16:18.487 --> 01:16:21.854
You never bothered
to ask why I did it.

01:16:22.224 --> 01:16:24.055
Look at me.

01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:26.121
The same oId shirt,
the same oId jeans...

01:16:26.228 --> 01:16:29.129
...and the same oId
shoes that you gave me.

01:16:29.398 --> 01:16:32.663
I have never spent a penny on myseIf.

01:16:33.235 --> 01:16:37.228
I have spent everything
on my Iove...my Jenny.

01:16:38.774 --> 01:16:42.335
It wasn't easy to win her heart.

01:16:44.079 --> 01:16:48.072
You rascaI...Iook at your own fate.

01:16:48.684 --> 01:16:51.016
We both grew up in a boy's hosteI.

01:16:51.153 --> 01:16:53.144
No sign or symboI of girIs

01:16:53.288 --> 01:16:54.084
And when we came out...

01:16:54.223 --> 01:16:55.451
... we were surrounded
by a brother or an uncIe...

01:16:55.591 --> 01:16:58.389
We spent our entire youth amongst men!

01:17:03.398 --> 01:17:05.366
It's true, Siddhu.

01:17:06.068 --> 01:17:09.697
I went through so much troubIe
to cajoIe that Monica aunty.

01:17:09.805 --> 01:17:10.567
Aunty?

01:17:11.473 --> 01:17:13.202
The neighbor's maid.
- I see.

01:17:13.342 --> 01:17:14.604
I was serious about her.

01:17:14.743 --> 01:17:16.301
But before I couId teII her...

01:17:16.445 --> 01:17:18.504
...she ran off with
that puncture-repairer.

01:17:19.314 --> 01:17:23.444
Life's been so hard on us...
that we never got any girI in our Iife.

01:17:23.719 --> 01:17:29.419
And see...I can't even
teII Ishita...that I Iove her.

01:17:29.725 --> 01:17:33.593
Veer, why are you crying?
- You're crying too.

01:17:33.762 --> 01:17:35.286
Your brother's stiII aIive.

01:17:35.397 --> 01:17:38.059
I wiII heIp you.
- You wiII.

01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:40.896
Yes...and you'II heIp me in return.

01:17:41.036 --> 01:17:42.628
You won't teII our brothers...

01:17:42.771 --> 01:17:44.432
...that I was the one
who stoIe aII that stuff.

01:17:44.573 --> 01:17:45.369
RascaI...

01:17:45.641 --> 01:17:49.133
Sorry, but you just wait and
watch the ideas I give you now.

01:17:49.244 --> 01:17:50.836
You won't stay bacheIor any more.

01:17:51.046 --> 01:17:52.877
In fact, no one wiII
stay bacheIor anymore.

01:17:53.048 --> 01:17:55.642
We'II even find a Mani-ben
for this Mani-bhai.

01:17:56.084 --> 01:17:57.346
WeII said.

01:17:57.653 --> 01:18:01.384
Even my parents never
thought about me, but you did.

01:18:01.924 --> 01:18:05.155
You're not human, you're definiteIy
some angeI. Get yourseIf checked up.

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:06.693
I am there.

01:18:06.962 --> 01:18:08.623
Veer, just see what I do now.

01:18:08.730 --> 01:18:10.129
Just wait and watch.

01:18:10.232 --> 01:18:12.496
What are you doing?
- What's this?

01:18:15.671 --> 01:18:17.571
Where's Veer?
Why isn't he here yet?

01:18:17.673 --> 01:18:19.641
Veer? Look!

01:18:24.179 --> 01:18:25.840
He's waiting for you there.

01:18:26.014 --> 01:18:27.481
Waiting for me?

01:18:36.458 --> 01:18:37.618
Hi.
- Hi.

01:18:37.926 --> 01:18:40.121
Ishita, I couId never
muster the courage to say this.

01:18:40.896 --> 01:18:42.955
But on this Christmas Eve...

01:18:43.065 --> 01:18:44.999
...I want to convey his message to you.

01:18:45.267 --> 01:18:46.359
Whose?

01:18:48.871 --> 01:18:49.997
My heart..

01:18:51.039 --> 01:18:51.869
Go ahead.

01:18:51.974 --> 01:18:55.808
WeII, normaIIy peopIe ceIebrate
Christmas with someone speciaI.

01:18:56.044 --> 01:18:58.672
But they are aII
dying to go out with me.

01:19:00.782 --> 01:19:02.682
But I wiII onIy go...

01:19:04.186 --> 01:19:05.175
...with her!

01:19:08.156 --> 01:19:09.350
I've Iied to you many times.

01:19:09.725 --> 01:19:12.558
But it's said that we shouId
speak onIy the truth on Christmas.

01:19:13.662 --> 01:19:15.926
So the truth is I reaIIy...

01:19:19.101 --> 01:19:22.935
I wiII be with you every
moment...for aII my Iife.

01:19:23.171 --> 01:19:25.799
Even if you Iook
Iike this years Iater.

01:19:34.383 --> 01:19:35.680
Brother...pIease handIe it.

01:19:57.039 --> 01:19:58.063
Veer.

01:19:59.741 --> 01:20:01.504
There's something I want to say.

01:20:01.710 --> 01:20:03.007
TeII me

01:20:04.146 --> 01:20:07.081
I think we shouId teII
our famiIies about us.

01:20:07.249 --> 01:20:09.843
What's the hurry, Ishu?
- I mean we've just started now.

01:20:09.952 --> 01:20:10.919
Veer...

01:20:11.053 --> 01:20:13.521
I don't want them to
find out from someone eIse.

01:20:13.722 --> 01:20:15.212
I won't Iike it.

01:20:15.490 --> 01:20:16.616
We shouId taIk to them.

01:20:16.758 --> 01:20:17.622
Yeah.

01:20:17.793 --> 01:20:18.691
What yeah...

01:20:18.794 --> 01:20:20.318
I wiII taIk to my famiIy...

01:20:20.562 --> 01:20:23.531
WiII you be abIe to teII your brother, or...
- Ishu.

01:20:23.765 --> 01:20:26.063
We Iove each other. It's not a crime.

01:20:26.234 --> 01:20:28.862
I'II teII brother on his face...

01:20:33.175 --> 01:20:35.473
It's been 28 minutes...
wiII you say something?

01:20:35.610 --> 01:20:38.078
AII you've been saying
is ''I want to say something''...

01:20:38.213 --> 01:20:38.736
What?

01:20:38.947 --> 01:20:41.677
I want to share my
personaI feeIings with you.

01:20:41.783 --> 01:20:42.715
Yeah.

01:20:43.118 --> 01:20:46.645
I need some time.
- Okay, okay, take your time.

01:20:54.129 --> 01:20:56.359
I want to ceIebrate my
'Suhagraat' (wedding night).

01:20:57.532 --> 01:20:58.362
With whom?

01:20:59.534 --> 01:21:00.432
Su...

01:21:00.569 --> 01:21:03.037
Subhash... I want to
teII you about Subhash.

01:21:03.138 --> 01:21:05.663
He's bringing the bumper
tomorrow...at the garage.

01:21:05.941 --> 01:21:07.704
You took 29 minutes to say that.

01:21:07.809 --> 01:21:10.107
Don't worry, I'II coIIect
the bumper from Subhash, okay?

01:21:13.048 --> 01:21:16.484
I want to marry you.

01:21:20.055 --> 01:21:21.079
What...
- No.

01:21:22.190 --> 01:21:23.350
What are you saying?

01:21:25.227 --> 01:21:27.195
I want to kiss you Iip-to-Iip.

01:21:28.397 --> 01:21:29.455
Are you crazy?

01:21:29.598 --> 01:21:30.462
What's he bIabbering.

01:21:30.599 --> 01:21:31.896
I'II teII you.

01:21:32.968 --> 01:21:34.993
I knew he couIdn't say it.

01:21:35.504 --> 01:21:37.495
ActuaIIy, brother...

01:21:38.807 --> 01:21:41.071
...we reaIIy Iove each other.

01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:43.034
ReaIIy?
- Yes.

01:21:43.512 --> 01:21:47.039
And I didn't want you to
find this out from someone eIse.

01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:49.978
I wouIdn't Iike it.

01:21:50.085 --> 01:21:53.714
Raj...Veer isn't fooIing
around this time..

01:21:53.955 --> 01:21:56.480
He's found the right girI this time.

01:21:56.625 --> 01:21:57.853
Yes, she's the right caII-girI.

01:21:57.993 --> 01:21:59.085
Oh Anwar...

01:21:59.261 --> 01:22:01.058
I am...
- ReaIIy sorry.

01:22:01.430 --> 01:22:03.591
ActuaIIy I wouId Iike
to meet your famiIy.

01:22:04.099 --> 01:22:05.589
Let me know if they're free tomorrow.

01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:07.065
I'II come over.
- Okay.

01:22:12.908 --> 01:22:15.741
Sir...madam wiII come
down in two minutes.

01:22:15.911 --> 01:22:17.469
WouId you Iike some tea or coffee?

01:22:17.679 --> 01:22:19.146
No. This is fine, thank you

01:22:19.247 --> 01:22:20.612
Okay, sir.

01:22:26.188 --> 01:22:27.655
I am sorry,
I think you are...

01:23:04.759 --> 01:23:06.852
After coming to know
that you're Veer's brother...

01:23:06.962 --> 01:23:09.089
...I won't Iet Ishita meet Veer again.

01:23:10.765 --> 01:23:12.255
You were mistaken, Meera.

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:14.061
I wanted to teII you the truth.

01:23:14.202 --> 01:23:15.999
But untiI then...
you were aIready gone.

01:23:17.272 --> 01:23:20.173
You onIy broke my trust, KaaIi.

01:23:21.276 --> 01:23:23.471
I spared your Iife
today for Ishita's sake.

01:23:23.945 --> 01:23:26.140
But if you come back here again,
I wiII kiII you.

01:23:33.955 --> 01:23:35.320
'Dear...
- Yes.'

01:23:36.324 --> 01:23:38.155
'Dear...you've managed to convince me.'

01:23:39.227 --> 01:23:43.163
'But...I know your
stubborn father too weII.'

01:23:43.331 --> 01:23:45.231
'He wiII never agree
to this reIationship.'

01:23:48.703 --> 01:23:49.670
'I wiII convince him.'

01:24:01.283 --> 01:24:02.477
Fine...

01:24:03.385 --> 01:24:05.478
...I am ready to meet them.

01:24:07.122 --> 01:24:08.749
Thank you so much, dad.

01:24:09.090 --> 01:24:13.618
I can toIerate anything...
but not your sad face.

01:24:14.696 --> 01:24:16.425
Thank you.

01:24:18.533 --> 01:24:20.933
MaIik sir, what have you done?

01:24:21.469 --> 01:24:24.063
You're going to bow down before
that Randhir for your daughter's sake.

01:24:24.472 --> 01:24:26.497
You didn't get it, Raghav.

01:24:27.008 --> 01:24:29.772
I can bow my head down
before my enemies for Meera...

01:24:30.145 --> 01:24:32.773
...but I cannot kneeI in front of them.

01:24:34.015 --> 01:24:37.951
It's time to end this enmity forever.

01:24:56.204 --> 01:24:57.728
I've often seen and heard...

01:24:58.073 --> 01:25:02.032
...that years of friendship
one day turns into a reIationship.

01:25:02.911 --> 01:25:05.607
But MaIik, this is the first time...

01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:09.739
...when an oId enmity is
turning into a reIationship.

01:25:10.151 --> 01:25:13.917
There's another way
to end the enmity, Randhir.

01:25:14.489 --> 01:25:16.423
KiII the enemy.

01:25:18.193 --> 01:25:18.852
Where's Meera?

01:25:18.994 --> 01:25:23.294
You see, KaaIi...
Meera Ioves you a Iot.

01:25:23.632 --> 01:25:27.796
She couIdn't have seen
you and your father die.

01:26:15.283 --> 01:26:18.741
Meera...KaaIi and his
father have deceived us.

01:26:19.487 --> 01:26:21.045
They have attacked us.

01:27:33.528 --> 01:27:34.290
Dad!

01:27:41.236 --> 01:27:42.203
Dad!

01:29:31.112 --> 01:29:33.137
Try to understand, Meera.

01:29:33.581 --> 01:29:36.846
Randhir Bakshi's men won't
stay quiet after what happened.

01:29:37.552 --> 01:29:39.611
If not yourseIf,
then Think about Ishita.

01:29:39.821 --> 01:29:43.052
Think about how aII this
wiII affect her when she finds out.

01:29:44.158 --> 01:29:45.989
You're Iike a sister to me, Meera.

01:29:46.628 --> 01:29:47.993
Listen to me.

01:29:49.063 --> 01:29:51.224
Take Ishita far away from here.

01:29:51.332 --> 01:29:53.493
And start a new Iife.

01:29:54.202 --> 01:29:56.966
We'II aIways protect you.

01:29:59.173 --> 01:30:02.074
Meera has gone far away.

01:30:04.746 --> 01:30:07.078
No one knows where.

01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:11.685
But I want to see Meera at any cost.

01:30:12.220 --> 01:30:14.154
I must teII her what happened there.

01:30:14.255 --> 01:30:17.190
KaaIi, I am not too inteIIigent.

01:30:17.559 --> 01:30:20.528
But aII this bIoodshed
has taught me one thing.

01:30:20.695 --> 01:30:23.163
There's no meaning to this Iife.

01:30:23.565 --> 01:30:27.433
It's best if you forget
everything...and think about Veer.

01:30:27.869 --> 01:30:29.234
Let's go together...

01:30:29.571 --> 01:30:32.005
We'II start a new Iife. Right?

01:30:58.866 --> 01:31:00.493
It's hard to beIieve...

01:31:01.436 --> 01:31:06.271
...that fate's repeating
the same story 15 years Iater.

01:31:08.076 --> 01:31:11.068
Seems Iike we're back
to square one .

01:31:11.312 --> 01:31:11.971
Yeah, Raj.

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:13.809
There are many other
Countries in the worId...

01:31:13.915 --> 01:31:15.780
...other than India and BuIgaria.

01:31:15.883 --> 01:31:19.011
But...they had to open
a hoteI at this pIace.

01:31:20.288 --> 01:31:23.689
AII these years I
hid this truth from Veer...

01:31:25.259 --> 01:31:27.625
...and he shouIdn't find out now either.

01:31:28.763 --> 01:31:31.425
We must stop Veer at any cost.

01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:34.092
And anyway...Meera...

01:31:35.670 --> 01:31:37.103
WiII never agree to this reIation.

01:31:37.205 --> 01:31:38.866
But I want to know...

01:31:39.107 --> 01:31:40.540
...what's the reason
behind your rejection.

01:31:40.675 --> 01:31:42.233
It's a big one, that's it.

01:31:42.477 --> 01:31:44.911
I do not want any more discussion
over this, Ishu

01:31:45.046 --> 01:31:45.569
Forget him.

01:31:45.713 --> 01:31:46.611
But why?

01:31:46.748 --> 01:31:48.739
What happened between
Ishita's sister and you...

01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:50.747
...that you said no.

01:31:51.052 --> 01:31:53.680
I aIready toId you...
you won't ask any more questions.

01:31:53.788 --> 01:31:55.312
There's some reason.
- Brother...

01:31:55.423 --> 01:31:58.915
Veer! There's a reason.

01:32:05.099 --> 01:32:07.761
It's a serious matter.
- But what is the matter.

01:32:08.036 --> 01:32:09.560
Look Sid, it's cIear that...

01:32:09.704 --> 01:32:11.604
...Raj brother knows Meera, otherwise...

01:32:11.806 --> 01:32:13.671
...what can be the reason to say no.

01:32:14.242 --> 01:32:16.767
Who knows about your brother's past?
- brother knows.

01:32:16.878 --> 01:32:17.810
The answer's correct...

01:32:17.912 --> 01:32:19.004
...but the direction is wrong.

01:32:19.113 --> 01:32:21.138
the person who knows about
your brother's past...

01:32:22.917 --> 01:32:24.179
...is my brother!

01:32:24.352 --> 01:32:25.478
Peter.

01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:27.451
Feed him something speciaI today
and don't charge him.

01:32:27.555 --> 01:32:29.523
Come on.
- I said I don't know.

01:32:29.691 --> 01:32:31.682
Now go away,
I've a Iot of customers to attend to.

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:33.491
Yogesh...are you going
to order something...

01:32:33.628 --> 01:32:34.890
...or take this TV home.

01:32:35.063 --> 01:32:36.428
I'II pIace my order in five minutes.

01:32:36.564 --> 01:32:38.794
You definiteIy know something.
You must teII me today.

01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:39.491
What?

01:32:39.634 --> 01:32:41.898
I won't budge untiI you don't teII me.

01:32:42.003 --> 01:32:44.028
Brother Shakti, pIease say something.

01:32:45.106 --> 01:32:47.506
Anwar brother...pIease
teII us their story.

01:32:47.742 --> 01:32:50.711
No...Anwar brother, for my sake...
pIease teII us.

01:32:50.912 --> 01:32:52.209
Don't do this.

01:32:54.315 --> 01:32:55.714
Their story?

01:32:56.551 --> 01:32:58.451
They were thieves.
- Anwar!

01:32:58.553 --> 01:32:59.645
Thieves?
- Thieves?

01:33:00.188 --> 01:33:01.212
Anwar!

01:33:02.023 --> 01:33:04.992
He means...they stoIe
each other's heart.

01:33:05.326 --> 01:33:07.794
Raj and Meera had an affair.

01:33:07.895 --> 01:33:10.090
Brother, pIease teII
us from the beginning. - Yes.

01:33:10.198 --> 01:33:13.133
Your brother's reaI
name was never Raj. - Anwar!

01:33:13.634 --> 01:33:16.364
He means...his reaI name was...

01:33:16.437 --> 01:33:17.233
RamIaI.

01:33:17.438 --> 01:33:18.962
RamIaI!
- RamIaI?

01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:20.971
And he Ioved bashing...

01:33:21.175 --> 01:33:25.236
He means he Ioved cIeaning cIothes.

01:33:25.513 --> 01:33:26.980
Why?
- Because RamIaI was a washerman.

01:33:27.081 --> 01:33:27.979
Brother was a washerman.

01:33:28.082 --> 01:33:30.550
Then Ishita's sister
must have a reaI name too.

01:33:30.718 --> 01:33:33.084
Ishita's sister's reaI name...

01:33:35.089 --> 01:33:36.647
Pogo!
- Pogo?

01:33:37.358 --> 01:33:38.916
RamIaI and Pogo...

01:33:39.026 --> 01:33:41.153
How did they meet?
- Meet...how?

01:33:44.031 --> 01:33:45.692
One day Pogo was waIking aII aIone...

01:33:45.833 --> 01:33:47.164
...when some goons came after her.

01:33:47.335 --> 01:33:49.200
That's when RamIaI
sIammed them to the ground.

01:33:49.370 --> 01:33:51.565
How can brother sIam anyone...
- He was a washerman...

01:33:51.672 --> 01:33:52.798
So he sIammed them on the ground.

01:33:52.974 --> 01:33:55.943
Then? - Then Pogo met
him every morning for tea.

01:33:56.043 --> 01:33:57.408
Then?
- Then...

01:33:58.112 --> 01:33:59.170
They wouId meet in
the evening in toiIets.

01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:00.804
Why the toiIet?

01:34:01.649 --> 01:34:02.775
Hand pump.
- Yeah.

01:34:02.917 --> 01:34:04.316
Because RamIaI wouId wash his cIothes...

01:34:04.485 --> 01:34:05.850
...at the hand pump which
was beIow Pogo's toiIet.

01:34:05.987 --> 01:34:08.285
If their Iove was so pumped up...

01:34:08.489 --> 01:34:10.116
...then how did it turn into hatred?

01:34:10.191 --> 01:34:11.522
Hatred...

01:34:13.127 --> 01:34:14.094
GoId is my God.

01:34:14.328 --> 01:34:17.661
Pogo Ioved diamonds,
jeweIs, goId and siIver.

01:34:17.832 --> 01:34:19.891
Their Iove story was somewhat Iike...

01:34:20.134 --> 01:34:21.726
'Khana Khazana' (Cookery Show).

01:34:21.869 --> 01:34:23.336
'Khana Khazana'...
what are you saying?

01:34:23.437 --> 01:34:25.337
Because RamIaI couId
bareIy manage a square meaI...

01:34:25.439 --> 01:34:27.066
...and Pogo was Iooking for treasure.

01:34:27.208 --> 01:34:29.540
Then? - And one day...
tired of aII the arguments...

01:34:29.644 --> 01:34:32.408
...your brother turned
into a... 'Chakka' (Eunuch).

01:34:32.513 --> 01:34:33.912
Brother turned into a...
'Chakka' (Eunuch)...How's this?

01:34:34.048 --> 01:34:35.982
He means to say...

01:34:36.450 --> 01:34:37.348
Yes, brother turned
into a... 'Chakka' (Eunuch).

01:34:37.451 --> 01:34:38.679
brother turned into
a... 'Chakka' (Eunuch) again.

01:34:38.853 --> 01:34:41.287
Veer, this is why he never got married.
- You shut up.

01:34:41.455 --> 01:34:43.355
I mean RamIaI was devastated...

01:34:43.457 --> 01:34:45.482
...because he couIdn't
fuIfiII Pogo's demands.

01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:46.684
And in between those two...

01:34:46.861 --> 01:34:47.919
'Daraar' (Void).

01:34:48.095 --> 01:34:48.993
'Judaai' (Separation).

01:34:49.330 --> 01:34:50.297
'Dushmani' (Enmity).

01:34:50.464 --> 01:34:51.260
'Tashan' (StyIe).

01:34:51.499 --> 01:34:52.591
Oh my, God.

01:34:52.733 --> 01:34:55.793
''Oh my, God'' In between them?
- It's just an expression.

01:34:56.003 --> 01:34:58.699
Don't peopIe say ''Oh my,
God'' when someone separates.

01:34:58.973 --> 01:35:01.840
Peter...cut-off that customer's finger.

01:35:02.043 --> 01:35:04.637
Who keeps pressing
the remote so frequentIy?

01:35:06.147 --> 01:35:07.637
Brother Shakti, I remember...

01:35:07.849 --> 01:35:10.875
...when dad and brother used
to come meet me at the hosteI...

01:35:11.052 --> 01:35:12.644
...they aIways wore good cIothes...

01:35:12.787 --> 01:35:14.448
...and came in big cars, we were rich.

01:35:14.822 --> 01:35:17.086
Because your brother was a washerman.

01:35:17.258 --> 01:35:19.419
He used to wear his
customer's cIothes.

01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:21.221
And your dad was a mechanic.

01:35:21.429 --> 01:35:23.420
He wouId drive his customer's car.

01:35:23.564 --> 01:35:24.826
Just Iike you do.

01:35:25.066 --> 01:35:26.590
You're a mechanic as weII.

01:35:26.701 --> 01:35:29.067
Go and fix cars...go on!

01:35:29.337 --> 01:35:30.099
Go!

01:35:30.271 --> 01:35:31.238
Brother...

01:35:31.439 --> 01:35:33.031
Was our father a waiter or...

01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:35.608
You get Iost to...come on, get out.

01:35:35.943 --> 01:35:39.902
Such an emotionaI story.

01:35:40.648 --> 01:35:41.979
This is wrong.

01:35:43.284 --> 01:35:44.808
- Anwar brother...

01:35:46.354 --> 01:35:48.914
Who asked you to open your mouth?

01:35:49.490 --> 01:35:52.186
Shakti, The chiIdren made me emotionaI.

01:35:53.461 --> 01:35:54.485
Your emotion...

01:35:55.663 --> 01:35:59.394
That's aII fine,
but why didn't you two get married?

01:36:01.302 --> 01:36:02.269
Come here.

01:36:03.671 --> 01:36:07.300
You...take that...
so many questions.

01:36:08.209 --> 01:36:09.574
Don't hit.
I just asked a question.

01:36:09.710 --> 01:36:12.406
Because we didn't
want to become fathers.

01:36:21.689 --> 01:36:26.217
See...he's stiII washing
everyone's cIothes.

01:36:28.663 --> 01:36:29.925
RamIaI!

01:36:33.434 --> 01:36:34.799
Hey RamIaI?

01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:43.607
What are you doing?

01:36:43.945 --> 01:36:44.969
What are you two doing?

01:36:45.146 --> 01:36:46.477
Let go of me, pIease...
what happened?

01:36:47.448 --> 01:36:51.976
Brother Shakti and Anwar
toId us everything about your past.

01:36:53.788 --> 01:36:56.086
Oh... Everything?

01:36:57.792 --> 01:37:01.922
Brother...you wouId use these
hands to wipe them, isn't it?

01:37:02.496 --> 01:37:03.485
Whose?

01:37:05.466 --> 01:37:08.401
Brother, why are you so worried?
- No, I am not worried.

01:37:08.502 --> 01:37:10.129
You weren't a beggar.

01:37:10.404 --> 01:37:12.201
You were a washerman.

01:37:12.974 --> 01:37:14.202
Washerman!?

01:37:14.809 --> 01:37:16.333
I am washerman?

01:37:16.477 --> 01:37:20.573
Brother...we know everything
about RamIaI and Pogo.

01:37:20.982 --> 01:37:21.949
RamIaI?

01:37:22.316 --> 01:37:22.873
Who?

01:37:23.417 --> 01:37:24.111
Pogo?

01:37:24.618 --> 01:37:26.916
Give me this.
Now we'II do aII this.

01:37:27.088 --> 01:37:27.816
Okay.

01:37:27.955 --> 01:37:29.081
You Go!

01:37:30.057 --> 01:37:31.149
Okay, okay...

01:37:33.127 --> 01:37:34.355
Bye, RamIaI.

01:37:35.463 --> 01:37:38.591
RamIaI? Pogo? Washerman?

01:37:38.933 --> 01:37:41.629
Raj, you said Veer shouId
never Iearn about the truth.

01:37:41.769 --> 01:37:45.068
But I never said that
You shouId turn me into RamIaI.

01:37:45.439 --> 01:37:47.270
We were Mafia, man.
- Yeah, that's right

01:37:47.441 --> 01:37:49.636
But they just pounced
on us...made us swear too...

01:37:49.777 --> 01:37:50.573
What eIse couId we do?

01:37:50.678 --> 01:37:52.373
You couId've said you don't know.
Don't know.

01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:53.742
Why don't we know?

01:37:53.848 --> 01:37:55.179
We've been together for so Iong.

01:37:55.282 --> 01:37:57.182
And Raj... even we have some honor.
Isn't it brother?

01:37:57.318 --> 01:37:59.377
Ohh...that's why you tarnished mine.

01:37:59.487 --> 01:38:02.251
Look at my personaIity,
Do I Iook Iike RamIaI from any angIe?

01:38:02.456 --> 01:38:04.083
KaaIi...sorry...

01:38:04.291 --> 01:38:06.589
Why are you getting so furious?

01:38:06.827 --> 01:38:08.385
Because I know Veer too weII.

01:38:08.496 --> 01:38:09.588
He won't stay quiet.

01:38:09.797 --> 01:38:13.324
He'II do something worse
than the story you just cooked up.

01:38:14.802 --> 01:38:15.996
And who's Pogo?

01:38:16.137 --> 01:38:17.001
Pogo?

01:38:17.104 --> 01:38:18.196
My Sister's name was Pogo?

01:38:18.305 --> 01:38:19.363
I don't beIieve this story.

01:38:19.473 --> 01:38:21.873
And my sister Ieft
your brother for money.

01:38:21.976 --> 01:38:24.001
How can this be true?
- Ishu, I heard this...

01:38:24.111 --> 01:38:25.510
...from one of brother's oId friend.

01:38:25.613 --> 01:38:27.376
His...brother.

01:38:27.648 --> 01:38:29.013
It's aII true.

01:38:29.450 --> 01:38:30.883
What about us now?

01:38:31.152 --> 01:38:34.781
Do one thing ...why don't you
two disappear for a few days.

01:38:35.056 --> 01:38:37.251
Who knows...maybe out of worry
RamIaI and Pogo meIt?

01:38:37.425 --> 01:38:39.620
Jenny...they're not some
ice-cream that wiII meIt.

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:42.422
I say that you two shouId
run away and get married.

01:38:43.330 --> 01:38:46.458
No...my sister's done a Iot for me.

01:38:46.967 --> 01:38:48.366
I cannot hurt her Iike this.

01:38:48.569 --> 01:38:50.730
Even I can't do this
with brother either.

01:38:52.173 --> 01:38:53.105
HoId on.

01:38:53.441 --> 01:38:58.674
Ishu...why didn't my brother and your
sister ever get married to someone eIse?

01:38:58.846 --> 01:38:59.744
Why?

01:39:00.147 --> 01:39:02.775
Because...they haven't
forgotten their memories...

01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:04.918
...and their daiIy one-night stands.

01:39:05.019 --> 01:39:06.611
Veer...you're taIking about my sister.

01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:08.278
Don't get into the detaiIs...
come to the point.

01:39:08.456 --> 01:39:10.356
If they did Iove each other...

01:39:10.458 --> 01:39:12.483
...then how about we
rekindIe that Iove again?

01:39:12.660 --> 01:39:14.184
And patch them up.

01:39:14.395 --> 01:39:15.259
What do you say?

01:39:15.396 --> 01:39:17.762
That can soIve our probIems.
- ExactIy.

01:39:17.932 --> 01:39:19.422
But how do we patch things up?

01:39:19.567 --> 01:39:20.727
How?

01:39:21.268 --> 01:39:22.929
OnIy God knows that.

01:39:52.433 --> 01:39:55.402
Patrick, I've heard some new
restaurant has opened up in Panjim.

01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:57.660
Yes, the owner is
some woman caIIed Meera.

01:39:57.771 --> 01:40:01.229
So go taIk to her...and our stuff..

01:40:03.711 --> 01:40:06.407
Dude...where's my car.

01:40:06.514 --> 01:40:07.481
There...

01:40:08.082 --> 01:40:09.947
Where's my car?

01:40:10.818 --> 01:40:13.844
Patrick, it had drugs worth miIIions.

01:40:14.021 --> 01:40:14.988
What?

01:40:15.089 --> 01:40:15.817
Veer...

01:40:16.624 --> 01:40:20.082
I got a superb idea to get
RamIaI and Pogo back together.

01:40:20.227 --> 01:40:20.852
What?

01:40:20.961 --> 01:40:22.656
We'II hire some goons...

01:40:22.763 --> 01:40:24.196
...and teII them to chase Pogo.

01:40:24.298 --> 01:40:26.630
The hero makes a dynamic entry...

01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:28.768
...when the viIIains
chasing the heroine.

01:40:28.936 --> 01:40:30.198
ViIIain's pack up...

01:40:30.371 --> 01:40:32.430
...and the hero-heroine wiII patch-up.

01:40:32.606 --> 01:40:33.573
What patch up?

01:40:33.674 --> 01:40:36.939
What an ancient idea
to rekindIe oId Iove, Sid.

01:40:37.077 --> 01:40:41.104
Veer...the oIdest wine
is the most intoxicating one.

01:40:41.282 --> 01:40:43.250
Just say yes...and then see...

01:40:43.417 --> 01:40:46.113
I'm sure you'II say...
''What a pIan''.

01:40:48.923 --> 01:40:51.255
Who wiII pose as the goon?
- We'II find someone.

01:40:55.829 --> 01:40:57.729
That's King's car.

01:40:58.432 --> 01:41:00.832
Why are you driving
around in King's car?

01:41:01.202 --> 01:41:03.466
I didn't know it was
King's car when I stoIe it.

01:41:03.637 --> 01:41:05.605
You mean you stoIe it.
- That too King's car.

01:41:05.706 --> 01:41:08.869
ExactIy...what wiII King
do when he finds out?

01:41:09.009 --> 01:41:10.670
So change its coIor...

01:41:10.811 --> 01:41:12.779
...so I can seII it to someone in Goa.

01:41:12.913 --> 01:41:15.848
Mani, you know I wiII never
heIp you with stoIen stuff.

01:41:16.016 --> 01:41:17.506
But the guy whose car you stoIe...

01:41:17.651 --> 01:41:19.551
...I've got a score
to settIe with him too.

01:41:21.055 --> 01:41:23.023
But first we must hide
this car from brother Raj.

01:41:23.157 --> 01:41:24.920
Tavde...
- Yes, brother.

01:41:25.259 --> 01:41:27.227
Hide the car...and
don't teII brother Raj.

01:41:27.361 --> 01:41:28.089
You want me to Iie to Raj sir?

01:41:28.262 --> 01:41:30.025
How about I teII him
you've got a girI. Get Iost

01:41:30.164 --> 01:41:31.631
Pinto, come on.

01:41:33.367 --> 01:41:37.599
I wiII never forget
what you two have done for me.

01:41:37.805 --> 01:41:39.773
Look, I've said this to brother Raj...

01:41:39.907 --> 01:41:41.101
...and I'm saying it again to you.

01:41:41.275 --> 01:41:44.244
If there's anything I can do for you...

01:41:44.411 --> 01:41:45.275
...just Iet me know.

01:41:45.412 --> 01:41:48.939
I'II stand
by you head over heeIs.

01:41:49.083 --> 01:41:52.780
Mani bhai, we do need heIp.
- Say it!

01:41:52.953 --> 01:41:55.786
Okay. You need to
pretend as a goon for us.

01:41:55.923 --> 01:41:56.719
Goon?

01:41:56.857 --> 01:41:59.087
Brother Raj's Iove story is stuck.

01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:00.022
Huh!

01:42:00.127 --> 01:42:01.719
Hero and Heroine wiII patch-up...

01:42:01.862 --> 01:42:04.558
...when you troubIe
the girI as the viIIain.

01:42:04.765 --> 01:42:05.959
WiII you, Mani bhai.?

01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:10.127
I can even give up
my Iife for brother Raj.

01:42:11.238 --> 01:42:13.729
Name, pIace,
animaI, thing...just name it.

01:42:13.841 --> 01:42:14.967
Say it!

01:42:15.075 --> 01:42:16.838
Mani bhai, just handIe it.

01:42:16.944 --> 01:42:18.468
Everything Iies in your hands now.

01:42:18.612 --> 01:42:19.601
Don't mess it up.

01:42:20.681 --> 01:42:22.615
Look Veer, she's coming.

01:42:23.083 --> 01:42:26.052
AII the best. - AII the best...
carefuI with the Ioin-cIoth!

01:42:36.630 --> 01:42:38.393
Do you want to die? Get out of the way.

01:42:38.565 --> 01:42:41.500
Just one question.
- What?

01:42:41.669 --> 01:42:45.002
Is there a Chintu in your home?
- No.

01:42:45.105 --> 01:42:46.072
That's it...

01:42:46.307 --> 01:42:51.745
Give me one chance...
and you'II get a Chintu.

01:42:57.818 --> 01:42:58.716
What a pIan.

01:42:58.852 --> 01:43:01.116
And according to the time Raj
wiII be coming through any minute.

01:43:01.288 --> 01:43:06.658
Now you'II say
''What are your intentions''.

01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:07.858
And I'II say...

01:43:10.164 --> 01:43:14.260
Next you'II say
''Don't come any cIoser''.

01:43:14.435 --> 01:43:15.629
I'II say...

01:43:17.838 --> 01:43:20.966
Then you'II say ''HeIp''.

01:43:21.275 --> 01:43:23.766
And I'II say ''Scream''.

01:43:24.945 --> 01:43:28.779
But no one wiII come to save you.

01:43:30.451 --> 01:43:31.782
Mani's acting so weII.

01:43:31.985 --> 01:43:33.077
What a pIan.

01:43:33.654 --> 01:43:35.815
And then you'II come cIoser.

01:43:36.256 --> 01:43:36.984
Yes.

01:43:37.157 --> 01:43:39.022
And hoId my hand tightIy.

01:43:39.159 --> 01:43:39.989
Yes!

01:43:40.094 --> 01:43:41.959
That's when you'II reaIize...

01:43:42.096 --> 01:43:44.394
...there's actuaIIy no one to heIp...

01:43:44.565 --> 01:43:46.760
No one. No one. Correct!

01:43:47.301 --> 01:43:47.892
You!

01:43:48.001 --> 01:43:48.899
Me.

01:43:54.808 --> 01:43:56.173
What are you taking out?

01:43:57.978 --> 01:43:59.673
This is cheating.

01:44:00.814 --> 01:44:02.543
I don't hit women.

01:44:04.084 --> 01:44:05.779
I spare you because you're a woman.

01:44:06.687 --> 01:44:08.120
Hit Iike a woman...

01:44:08.389 --> 01:44:10.050
Why are you hitting Iike a man?

01:44:11.425 --> 01:44:12.790
She's Ietting him have it!

01:44:13.761 --> 01:44:14.921
HeIp me!

01:44:15.229 --> 01:44:16.856
Where are you going?

01:44:24.538 --> 01:44:28.065
Pogo channeI turned into WWF.

01:44:28.442 --> 01:44:33.209
She smashed me up...

01:44:33.847 --> 01:44:39.808
She smashed me up...
Even these two abandoned me.

01:44:39.987 --> 01:44:41.420
SeriousIy, this is the Iimit guys.

01:44:41.855 --> 01:44:43.152
Is this the way?

01:44:43.290 --> 01:44:44.985
And who comes up with such ideas?
- He does.

01:44:45.659 --> 01:44:47.024
Get sister in troubIe...
brother wiII save her...

01:44:47.194 --> 01:44:48.161
...and those two wiII faII in Iove.

01:44:48.295 --> 01:44:49.262
That's the Iimit.

01:44:49.396 --> 01:44:51.455
Have you Iost your mind, Veer?

01:44:51.899 --> 01:44:52.923
Brother...
- Veer...

01:44:53.967 --> 01:44:55.161
And what do you guys think...

01:44:55.302 --> 01:44:56.963
...by doing this, she ..

01:44:59.406 --> 01:45:01.101
That reIation is over.

01:45:01.942 --> 01:45:02.931
You wiII gain nothing.

01:45:03.177 --> 01:45:04.109
There's no point.

01:45:04.278 --> 01:45:06.007
Veer...aII this doesn't Iook good.

01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:08.407
Don't be such a fooI.
Everything is over.

01:45:08.515 --> 01:45:10.380
How can you say that?

01:45:12.619 --> 01:45:15.782
Brother...
firstIy I am not ready to beIieve...

01:45:15.923 --> 01:45:17.857
...that sister Ieft you for money.

01:45:18.625 --> 01:45:20.422
And even if she did...

01:45:21.562 --> 01:45:23.723
...then why didn't
she marry someone eIse?

01:45:26.567 --> 01:45:29.400
You're on the right track...
bombard him with another one.

01:45:30.237 --> 01:45:33.604
Why didn't she make anyone
eIse her Iife-partner?

01:45:35.175 --> 01:45:36.540
Go on. Go on.

01:45:36.643 --> 01:45:38.634
And even brother didn't
marry anyone eIse, right?

01:45:38.912 --> 01:45:40.402
Yes, why?

01:45:40.547 --> 01:45:43.539
Even you didn't find
anyone eIse for yourseIf.

01:45:43.650 --> 01:45:47.416
You never even went on a three
night-four day tour with some girI.

01:45:48.956 --> 01:45:52.653
Brother Raj...onIy you
know what's in your heart.

01:45:53.594 --> 01:45:56.654
But I've understood
what's in sister's heart.

01:45:56.997 --> 01:46:00.660
RegardIess of what
happened between you two...

01:46:00.968 --> 01:46:03.459
...she stiII hasn't
forgotten her first Iove.

01:46:10.077 --> 01:46:11.339
Veer, deIiver the car.

01:46:17.551 --> 01:46:19.041
Brother's meIting.

01:46:19.219 --> 01:46:22.279
Brother, I've another pIan.

01:46:22.623 --> 01:46:24.648
Mani bhai...
- Shut up!

01:46:25.626 --> 01:46:27.321
I've to attend a meeting.

01:46:27.461 --> 01:46:29.861
Wrap up everything
here and come home. Okay thanks.

01:46:30.163 --> 01:46:31.653
Bye.
- Bye.

01:46:39.673 --> 01:46:42.164
This car wiII definiteIy
break-down before it reaches Panjim.

01:46:42.409 --> 01:46:44.707
And Iike every day,
brother wiII pass-by.

01:46:44.811 --> 01:46:46.676
Ishita, something wiII
definiteIy happen today.

01:47:57.918 --> 01:48:02.946
''WaIk with me...in every Iifetime.''

01:48:03.457 --> 01:48:08.417
''Promise me...
you'II come back to me right here''

01:48:08.595 --> 01:48:13.726
''We're one souI...
even if we're two bodies.''

01:48:14.134 --> 01:48:19.094
''AIways be mine...
don't ever say goodbye.''

01:48:19.406 --> 01:48:24.605
''You're my dawn...
and you're my twiIight.''

01:48:25.479 --> 01:48:30.007
''You're the pain...
and you're the comfort.''

01:48:30.250 --> 01:48:35.415
''There's onIy one thing
I ever pray for in my mind.''

01:48:35.889 --> 01:48:40.917
''AIways be mine...
don't ever say goodbye.''

01:48:57.778 --> 01:49:02.806
''AIways be mine...
don't ever say...

01:49:03.684 --> 01:49:08.644
''Both my worId Iie in your arms.''

01:49:09.122 --> 01:49:13.889
''My heaven is wherever you are.''

01:49:14.461 --> 01:49:19.398
''Desire's are burning
in both our hearts.''

01:49:19.966 --> 01:49:24.596
''I wish my prayers
are never unanswered.''

01:49:24.771 --> 01:49:29.970
''You're my desire, I am your Iove.''

01:49:30.277 --> 01:49:35.874
''You're my poem...I am your music.''

01:49:36.149 --> 01:49:41.143
''You...You...
You're the one I crave for.''

01:49:41.555 --> 01:49:46.254
''Become the intoxication in my veins
and keep fIowing.

01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:51.657
''Repay my Iove in this way.''

01:49:52.265 --> 01:49:58.067
''AIways be mine...
don't ever say goodbye.''

01:50:00.273 --> 01:50:02.764
''...goodbye.''

01:50:42.716 --> 01:50:44.741
Veer, superb buddy.

01:50:44.885 --> 01:50:47.080
You've done an amazing job.

01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:49.083
You compIeteIy changed
the Iook of the car.

01:50:49.222 --> 01:50:52.680
Even King can never recognize it.

01:50:53.727 --> 01:50:55.388
Veer, what's wrong?

01:50:55.629 --> 01:50:57.290
Why are you in a bad mood?

01:50:58.465 --> 01:50:59.989
No matter how hard we try...

01:51:00.066 --> 01:51:02.057
...Pogo and brother's
Iove story doesn't pick up.

01:51:02.169 --> 01:51:04.194
I don't know what to do now.

01:51:04.337 --> 01:51:07.306
Veer...I do have an idea.

01:51:07.374 --> 01:51:09.706
No more idea. No, buddy no..
- It's sure shot, pIease.

01:51:09.776 --> 01:51:11.607
At Ieast hear me out. Hear me out.

01:51:11.678 --> 01:51:14.841
What if we rekindIe their passion?

01:51:15.182 --> 01:51:16.774
Passion? How?

01:51:16.983 --> 01:51:18.974
There's a new fiIm pIaying
in Edward's Theatre.

01:51:19.186 --> 01:51:21.450
Let's buy corner
seat tickets for them.

01:51:21.588 --> 01:51:22.680
They'II watch the fiIm together...

01:51:22.789 --> 01:51:24.689
...and rekindIe their passion.

01:51:25.125 --> 01:51:27.286
What fiIm? - 'Tamboo Mein Dhoom-Dham'
(Indian C-grade fiIm).

01:51:27.527 --> 01:51:29.085
Come here. Come here.

01:51:29.596 --> 01:51:31.188
You and your pervert ideas.

01:51:31.431 --> 01:51:33.023
Pinto, wrap the boot.

01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:35.862
It's a nice fiIm. I've seen it myseIf.

01:51:37.304 --> 01:51:39.033
Brother, there's a bag in here.

01:51:42.542 --> 01:51:44.533
Whose bag is this?

01:51:45.478 --> 01:51:47.309
I guess it Mani bhai's.

01:51:47.714 --> 01:51:49.739
This isn't my bag.
- What?

01:51:49.883 --> 01:51:52.681
Then whose bag is it?
- I don't know.

01:51:52.819 --> 01:51:53.808
Open it.

01:51:56.289 --> 01:51:58.189
Oh God...drugs!

01:51:58.291 --> 01:52:01.658
Drugs! This is
definiteIy King's stuff.

01:52:01.728 --> 01:52:03.389
What do we do with it now?

01:52:04.664 --> 01:52:06.529
If these drugs get out in the market...

01:52:06.733 --> 01:52:08.894
...there's no teIIing how
many wiII faII prey to it.

01:52:09.069 --> 01:52:10.661
Then what do we do it.

01:52:13.406 --> 01:52:14.395
Let's burn it.

01:52:14.507 --> 01:52:18.443
These drugs were going
to ruin the entire youth.

01:52:18.912 --> 01:52:23.815
King...I reaIIy enjoyed
burning your stuff.

01:52:24.117 --> 01:52:27.177
I think Mani bhai is drunk.
- Drunk?

01:52:27.320 --> 01:52:28.548
He's compIeteIy over the top.

01:52:28.688 --> 01:52:31.521
Mani bhai, controI.
- What controI?

01:52:31.958 --> 01:52:33.926
Lose controI!

01:52:34.027 --> 01:52:35.995
Lose controI!

01:52:38.531 --> 01:52:39.998
What..

01:52:43.436 --> 01:52:43.993
King!

01:52:44.070 --> 01:52:45.037
King!

01:52:47.007 --> 01:52:48.497
What are you guys burning?

01:52:50.710 --> 01:52:51.608
What are you guys burning teII me?

01:52:51.711 --> 01:52:54.839
We're burning the stuff from the car.
- What?

01:52:55.482 --> 01:52:57.313
You see...once a month...

01:52:57.484 --> 01:53:00.885
...we burn aII the scrap
from the garage in a bonfire.

01:53:01.454 --> 01:53:03.513
Sir...what are you doing here?

01:53:04.090 --> 01:53:07.685
My car's broken down.
- We'II fix it.

01:53:11.264 --> 01:53:13.164
Yeah...
- Ignition.

01:53:17.671 --> 01:53:18.660
What?

01:53:19.673 --> 01:53:20.901
Why are you Iaughing?

01:53:21.241 --> 01:53:26.406
He's warming his hands
on the ashes of his own stuff.

01:53:26.846 --> 01:53:29.838
Shut up, Mani. You'II give us away.

01:53:39.926 --> 01:53:41.450
Veer...he's gone.

01:53:41.728 --> 01:53:42.854
Fix it quickIy.

01:53:55.709 --> 01:54:00.442
King...you're Iooking reaIIy smart.

01:54:04.651 --> 01:54:05.743
Thank you.

01:54:06.653 --> 01:54:08.484
But you wouId Iook smarter...

01:54:08.555 --> 01:54:12.047
...with your father's favorite car.

01:54:12.759 --> 01:54:14.920
Did you find the car?

01:54:15.428 --> 01:54:17.055
You didn't, right?

01:54:17.664 --> 01:54:20.394
King, don't mind...he's drunk.

01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:21.692
Mani...

01:54:25.672 --> 01:54:30.837
King...was there something in the car?

01:54:31.444 --> 01:54:33.275
You didn't find that either, did you?

01:54:33.513 --> 01:54:36.243
Hey...show some manners.

01:54:36.583 --> 01:54:37.550
He's King.

01:54:39.686 --> 01:54:42.177
King...is my AngeI.

01:54:46.593 --> 01:54:47.924
King...

01:54:49.462 --> 01:54:51.692
...did you find KaaIi?

01:54:52.799 --> 01:54:54.767
You didn't find him either.

01:54:55.935 --> 01:54:58.165
King...your car's fixed.

01:55:05.545 --> 01:55:06.876
Come on.

01:55:08.281 --> 01:55:10.078
Mani, what are you doing?

01:55:10.150 --> 01:55:11.640
Why do you drink so much?

01:55:15.588 --> 01:55:18.148
Veer...Siddhu!

01:55:19.459 --> 01:55:22.917
Did RamIaI and Pogo patch up?

01:55:23.530 --> 01:55:25.122
They didn't either?

01:55:42.782 --> 01:55:43.339
Get out!

01:55:43.616 --> 01:55:45.811
We...work for King!

01:55:45.985 --> 01:55:47.145
I said get out.

01:55:54.928 --> 01:55:56.862
Joshua...that's KaaIi!

01:56:35.702 --> 01:56:36.669
What's the matter, Veer?

01:56:36.803 --> 01:56:38.395
These days you've been
visiting the church quite often.

01:56:38.805 --> 01:56:40.295
How did you get so reIigious?

01:56:40.440 --> 01:56:41.270
Yes, brother.

01:56:41.407 --> 01:56:43.238
There are onIy two things
in our Iife that matters.

01:56:43.376 --> 01:56:45.037
Car...and Sans-kar (VaIues).

01:56:46.913 --> 01:56:48.710
Nice church, right?

01:56:53.086 --> 01:56:55.179
Brother, I'II go get the candIes.

01:56:55.588 --> 01:56:58.022
Wait here,
sis...I'II go get the candIes.

01:57:16.176 --> 01:57:17.336
Are you foIIowing me?

01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:20.138
I came here with Veer.

01:57:21.181 --> 01:57:21.875
Where is he?

01:57:22.048 --> 01:57:24.516
Raj my boy, you here.

01:57:26.186 --> 01:57:29.280
And Joshua toId me...
that you're Meera.

01:57:30.056 --> 01:57:31.489
Let me introduce myseIf.

01:57:31.691 --> 01:57:34.683
I am King... Charmed.

01:57:35.061 --> 01:57:36.289
It's a good thing we met...

01:57:36.429 --> 01:57:38.397
I was thinking of
coming over to meet you.

01:57:38.631 --> 01:57:41.031
Last night my men came to your shack...

01:57:41.201 --> 01:57:43.669
...and suddenIy KaaIi dropped in.

01:57:46.239 --> 01:57:47.706
Do you know KaaIi?

01:57:48.575 --> 01:57:50.566
Because if you do...then teII me.

01:57:50.777 --> 01:57:53.211
And I promise you my men
wiII never troubIe you again.

01:57:53.446 --> 01:57:55.846
Of course, wiII finish him.

01:58:01.221 --> 01:58:03.189
Do you know KaaIi?

01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:08.393
I don't know him!

01:58:12.532 --> 01:58:15.330
Just once I Iay my hand on KaaIi...

01:58:15.501 --> 01:58:19.528
You know what...I'II pray to
the Lord that you never find KaaIi.

01:58:20.006 --> 01:58:22.167
Who knows...what wiII happen...

01:58:23.409 --> 01:58:25.070
To him...not you.

01:58:25.211 --> 01:58:28.442
Yeah...Got to go, bro.
- Have a good day.

01:58:38.925 --> 01:58:41.018
Oh my....

01:58:43.863 --> 01:58:46.559
Veer...you did an amazing job.

01:58:46.766 --> 01:58:49.030
You turned a IandIine
into a smartphone...

01:58:49.202 --> 01:58:52.000
...and an oId piece
of junk into Iron Man.

01:58:52.205 --> 01:58:53.832
You turned bat into Batman...

01:58:54.007 --> 01:58:55.975
...and Spider into Spider' Man.

01:58:56.376 --> 01:58:57.206
Oh my...

01:58:57.310 --> 01:58:59.870
BIackberry at the bottom...
and Bappi Lahiri on top.

01:59:00.213 --> 01:59:02.044
I'II seII this at
the rate of an airpIane.

01:59:02.215 --> 01:59:03.239
By the way...what's the
rate of airpIanes nowadays?

01:59:03.349 --> 01:59:06.250
Forget about airpIanes
and just go seII this thing.

01:59:06.386 --> 01:59:08.047
This is King's car.

01:59:08.221 --> 01:59:10.917
If he finds out...
- Then you'II disappear forever.

01:59:11.024 --> 01:59:12.491
Oh... Correct.

01:59:12.692 --> 01:59:14.489
Bravo my boy.

01:59:14.594 --> 01:59:18.621
Keep this...Lux cozy...
Rupa's underwear.

01:59:18.898 --> 01:59:19.922
Underwear.

01:59:20.166 --> 01:59:22.191
Oscar bhai,
you Iook reaIIy happy today.

01:59:22.368 --> 01:59:23.357
What's the matter?

01:59:23.536 --> 01:59:29.805
BIoody raincoat...I couId've given
you any amount you had asked for.

01:59:29.976 --> 01:59:30.738
Why?

01:59:30.877 --> 01:59:32.970
Because my sister just toId me...

01:59:33.179 --> 01:59:35.010
...that she's in Iove with some boy.

01:59:35.181 --> 01:59:37.706
Some boy...who owns a hoteI.

01:59:37.850 --> 01:59:39.647
ArieI...and Harpic.

01:59:39.752 --> 01:59:41.276
Yeah!

01:59:41.487 --> 01:59:44.115
Tomorrow I am going to taIk to his
famiIy about their marriage.

01:59:44.223 --> 01:59:45.986
And if it's fixed...

01:59:46.192 --> 01:59:48.057
...then I am thinking
of presenting this...

01:59:48.194 --> 01:59:50.958
...on their wedding.

01:59:51.197 --> 01:59:52.459
HoId a second.

01:59:52.732 --> 01:59:55.860
ShouId I present a gift?
Or gift a present?

01:59:56.936 --> 01:59:57.834
It's the same thing, Oscar bhai.

01:59:57.937 --> 01:59:58.961
A gift is a gift after aII...

01:59:59.205 --> 02:00:01.730
Wow...you read my heart.

02:00:01.874 --> 02:00:03.705
Mani you're just a honey.

02:00:04.711 --> 02:00:06.508
Jenny's here, Siddhu.

02:00:06.746 --> 02:00:07.735
Jenny?

02:00:08.014 --> 02:00:10.175
Hi, hi...
- What's up, Jenny?

02:00:10.283 --> 02:00:11.409
Jenny, you here?

02:00:11.584 --> 02:00:13.484
You couId've caIIed.

02:00:13.653 --> 02:00:14.881
Guess what?
- What?

02:00:15.054 --> 02:00:17.249
I toId my brother everything about us.

02:00:17.390 --> 02:00:19.358
And he's agreed to our marriage.
- What?

02:00:19.525 --> 02:00:21.618
In fact, he's come here to meet you.

02:00:21.794 --> 02:00:22.920
What are you saying, Jenny?

02:00:23.096 --> 02:00:26.554
Why are you stiII standing?
Where is he standing?

02:00:26.666 --> 02:00:27.997
Brother-in-Iaw.
- Siddhu.

02:00:28.234 --> 02:00:29.792
Where are you brother-in-Iaw?

02:00:29.936 --> 02:00:32.598
Mona Lisa...

02:00:33.106 --> 02:00:34.266
Oscar bhai.

02:00:35.908 --> 02:00:38.342
What are you doing?
- What are you doing here?

02:00:38.444 --> 02:00:40.708
I'm here to meet
my sister's boyfriend.

02:00:40.913 --> 02:00:43.074
And I am here to meet
my girIfriend's brother.

02:00:43.249 --> 02:00:44.944
Where is he? Introduce me?

02:00:45.251 --> 02:00:46.582
He's the one.

02:00:46.686 --> 02:00:48.051
It's him.

02:00:48.287 --> 02:00:49.652
You?
- You?

02:00:49.822 --> 02:00:52.290
I guess you two know each other
from before.

02:00:55.661 --> 02:00:57.458
They know each other too weII.

02:00:57.563 --> 02:00:58.427
In and out.

02:00:58.731 --> 02:01:01.564
Everything that he took
out...he wouId take in. Right?

02:01:01.667 --> 02:01:03.464
In and out.
What are you saying?

02:01:03.603 --> 02:01:05.468
Sister, I'II teII you.

02:01:05.605 --> 02:01:07.835
This guy's a down-market thief.

02:01:08.007 --> 02:01:10.066
BIoody fooI...coIgate.. babuI.

02:01:10.209 --> 02:01:11.972
Thief.
Siddhu, you're a thief.

02:01:12.211 --> 02:01:14.304
WeII...your brother's a thief too.

02:01:14.447 --> 02:01:16.415
And he's got a shop at the fIea-market.
- Brother.

02:01:16.582 --> 02:01:18.743
He used to buy aII the goods I stoIe.

02:01:19.352 --> 02:01:20.546
Forget your girIfriend's brother...

02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:21.880
Your brother's coming.
- Brother...

02:01:22.155 --> 02:01:23.417
Stop him. He'II go berserk.

02:01:23.623 --> 02:01:25.386
Brother...brother...

02:01:25.491 --> 02:01:28.187
Shakti, pIease don't...

02:01:28.594 --> 02:01:30.425
Did I starve him?

02:01:30.696 --> 02:01:31.993
So what was the reason...

02:01:32.231 --> 02:01:34.028
Brother, this girI...

02:01:34.233 --> 02:01:36.201
This girI is the reason, brother.

02:01:37.036 --> 02:01:39.197
Brother, in this era you can ask
any youth Iike me...

02:01:39.305 --> 02:01:41.705
...and he'II teII
you that finding Iove...

02:01:41.841 --> 02:01:45.004
...has become so expensive and hard.

02:01:45.244 --> 02:01:48.907
I mean...if we go watch a fiIm
in the muItipIex, that's 800 rupees.

02:01:49.048 --> 02:01:51.380
And if you eat a combo
of popcorn and fritters...

02:01:51.484 --> 02:01:52.576
...then it's 900 rupees.

02:01:52.752 --> 02:01:55.619
And after that if your
baby says ''Baby, coffee''...

02:01:55.755 --> 02:01:58.724
...then treating her to coffee
costs aImost 1000 rupees.

02:01:58.858 --> 02:02:00.223
And aII night on your
prepaid card, we do...

02:02:00.426 --> 02:02:04.385
''HeIIo...baby, sweety, Iove you...''

02:02:04.497 --> 02:02:07.898
Then where the 2000 rupees go,
no one knows.

02:02:08.267 --> 02:02:11.168
And...gift on her birthday.

02:02:11.370 --> 02:02:12.701
Gift on VaIentine's Day.

02:02:12.905 --> 02:02:16.306
''And baby...we met for
the first time on Friday.''

02:02:16.843 --> 02:02:20.677
Then every Friday...
there's a weekIy anniversary gift.

02:02:20.780 --> 02:02:22.338
I mean Iike...reaIIy...

02:02:22.548 --> 02:02:25.073
So many expenses?
- You don't know.

02:02:25.218 --> 02:02:27.880
Brother...your era
was compIeteIy different.

02:02:28.054 --> 02:02:29.316
Your date wouId mean
eating corncobs and having tea...

02:02:29.422 --> 02:02:32.323
...and cozying up behind stones.

02:02:32.558 --> 02:02:35.391
But the girIs these days
are very high maintenance.

02:02:35.528 --> 02:02:36.586
Ask us...

02:02:36.762 --> 02:02:39.526
We've to pay weekIy at muItipIexes,
coffee shops...

02:02:39.632 --> 02:02:41.862
...and maIIs to prove our Iove.

02:02:42.034 --> 02:02:44.559
It is not that easy.
It's bIoody extortion.

02:02:44.670 --> 02:02:45.568
Siddhu...

02:02:45.671 --> 02:02:46.933
ReIax, Siddhu...
or you'II bIow a nerve.

02:02:47.106 --> 02:02:48.596
Wait, I'II handIe him now.

02:02:48.741 --> 02:02:51.642
Siddhu .. we didn't know you were
going through so many troubIes.

02:02:51.811 --> 02:02:53.335
It's so expensive.

02:02:53.746 --> 02:02:56.544
Shakti, the poor boy's
stuck between Iove and expenses.

02:02:57.049 --> 02:02:58.778
Puraskar bhai..
- Oscar bhai.

02:02:58.918 --> 02:03:00.408
It's the same thing.
You're an award after aII.

02:03:00.653 --> 02:03:03.247
Siddhu's a nice guy.
- Yeah.

02:03:03.422 --> 02:03:05.515
For me, Siddhu is just Iike Veer.

02:03:05.658 --> 02:03:07.091
Oscar bhai, he's my brother.

02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:09.888
We're a descent famiIy.
No criminaI records.

02:03:10.062 --> 02:03:12.053
Forget that,
he Ioves your sister so much.

02:03:12.198 --> 02:03:14.689
He's weII to do.
The café, garage, property...

02:03:14.867 --> 02:03:16.061
It wiII aII beIong
to these two after us.

02:03:16.202 --> 02:03:18.864
PIease, say yes.
- But how can I say yes.

02:03:19.038 --> 02:03:20.062
Why not?

02:03:20.206 --> 02:03:20.695
Why not?

02:03:20.873 --> 02:03:22.670
You two are aIready
a match made in heaven.

02:03:22.808 --> 02:03:23.740
Us?

02:03:23.876 --> 02:03:27.209
You two are saiIing in the same boat.

02:03:27.446 --> 02:03:29.471
Don't feeI embarrassed.
FeeI proud of him.

02:03:29.615 --> 02:03:30.172
But...

02:03:30.449 --> 02:03:33.350
Brother, pIease say yes.
- Come on, say yes.

02:03:33.553 --> 02:03:37.011
Okay...I agree to this marriage...

02:03:37.223 --> 02:03:38.554
Jackie Shroff IookaIike.

02:03:38.724 --> 02:03:40.385
But I have a condition.

02:03:40.927 --> 02:03:42.792
Is someone going to ask what?
- What?

02:03:42.929 --> 02:03:44.897
The marriage takes
pIace in a church.

02:03:45.031 --> 02:03:46.089
What are you saying?

02:03:46.232 --> 02:03:48.325
Everyone agreed to Siddhu
and Jenny's marriage.

02:03:48.601 --> 02:03:50.034
That's great news.

02:03:50.236 --> 02:03:51.168
Their famiIy said yes...

02:03:51.270 --> 02:03:53.067
...I wonder when wiII
our famiIy say yes.

02:03:53.239 --> 02:03:55.639
Don't worry,
Veer...they wiII say yes.

02:03:55.908 --> 02:03:57.808
TeII Siddhu we want a party.

02:03:58.110 --> 02:04:01.705
Let's aII meet and ceIebrate.
What say?

02:04:01.814 --> 02:04:03.111
Yeah, okay. CooI
- Bye.

02:04:06.252 --> 02:04:09.744
I toId you...not to keep
any kind of reIation with them.

02:04:11.190 --> 02:04:12.350
Sis...

02:04:14.727 --> 02:04:19.221
Sis...you've a probIem
with that famiIy. Not me.

02:04:20.566 --> 02:04:24.468
And you're not teIIing
me what that probIem is either.

02:04:24.637 --> 02:04:28.004
I don't understand
why you're doing this, sis.

02:04:32.044 --> 02:04:34.604
After mom and dad passed away...

02:04:36.248 --> 02:04:40.082
...I've aIways fuIfiIIed
aII your wishes and wants

02:04:42.421 --> 02:04:44.184
And never asked why.

02:04:45.224 --> 02:04:47.784
I even Iet you take
your own decisions.

02:04:49.562 --> 02:04:51.530
And never asked why.

02:04:52.298 --> 02:04:57.930
So today, for the first time, when
I am stopping you from something...

02:04:59.238 --> 02:05:01.399
...can't you do this much for me?

02:05:04.477 --> 02:05:08.709
Fine, sis...I'II do everything you say.

02:05:09.248 --> 02:05:11.716
I'II never ask anything, I promise.

02:05:14.020 --> 02:05:15.817
But if not Veer...

02:05:16.522 --> 02:05:19.355
...then there won't be
anyone eIse in my Iife.

02:05:41.580 --> 02:05:42.547
Ishita...

02:05:43.949 --> 02:05:45.473
CaII Veer home tomorrow.

02:05:46.652 --> 02:05:49.212
I want to taIk to him.
- You mean...

02:05:49.422 --> 02:05:51.356
Ask him to come aIone.

02:05:53.726 --> 02:05:55.694
Thank you, Pogo... Ma'am.

02:05:55.795 --> 02:05:57.092
Sorry...!

02:05:57.463 --> 02:06:00.523
Brother wiII be reaIIy
happy to know that you said yes.

02:06:01.834 --> 02:06:03.563
But now you must accept
one of my condition!

02:06:03.769 --> 02:06:04.326
Done.

02:06:04.437 --> 02:06:05.563
I mean...whatever it is, I agree.

02:06:05.738 --> 02:06:08.366
You can say it for formaIity,
but done.

02:06:08.774 --> 02:06:11.140
After the marriage,
you must Iive here.

02:06:15.581 --> 02:06:19.540
If you want to be with Ishita...
you must Ieave your brother.

02:06:22.722 --> 02:06:24.485
Sis...what are you saying?

02:06:26.192 --> 02:06:28.160
Are you joking?

02:06:35.801 --> 02:06:37.701
Ishu...this is a big issue.

02:06:38.738 --> 02:06:40.968
Meera's asking me
to Ieave my brother.

02:06:41.207 --> 02:06:45.041
See, I reaIIy Iove you...
but he isn't just my brother.

02:06:45.277 --> 02:06:48.075
He's my father,
mother, friend...everything.

02:06:48.781 --> 02:06:51.477
AII his Iife he has onIy
cared about my happiness.

02:06:51.650 --> 02:06:53.242
And she wants...

02:06:58.591 --> 02:07:02.220
Sorry madam...you might
own a restaurant.

02:07:02.361 --> 02:07:05.262
But this is not some
home-deIivery or take-away.

02:07:12.471 --> 02:07:13.938
Ishita, I am sorry.

02:07:17.376 --> 02:07:20.174
But nothing is more
important than a brother.

02:07:22.381 --> 02:07:23.507
Not even you.

02:07:31.857 --> 02:07:32.551
Veer!

02:07:36.061 --> 02:07:38.291
You're Ieaving her
for that brother of yours.

02:07:38.564 --> 02:07:40.657
He isn't even your bIood brother.

02:07:44.336 --> 02:07:47.305
Your dad picked him
up from the streets.

02:07:47.873 --> 02:07:49.204
Ishita...

02:07:50.709 --> 02:07:53.473
You don't beIieve me.
Ask him yourseIf.

02:07:53.579 --> 02:07:54.477
Enough!

02:08:35.487 --> 02:08:36.545
Where were you Veer?

02:08:36.689 --> 02:08:38.088
I've been asking around for you.

02:08:38.224 --> 02:08:39.885
Come, Iet's eat...

02:08:43.429 --> 02:08:44.589
What happened?

02:08:47.900 --> 02:08:51.199
I wanted to ask you something.
- Ask. Why are you standing Iike that?

02:08:51.503 --> 02:08:54.370
Is there something you've ever hidden
from me?

02:08:54.907 --> 02:08:56.875
What couId I ever hide from you?

02:08:57.042 --> 02:09:00.534
No! There's nothing
I have hidden from you.

02:09:01.213 --> 02:09:03.306
You're not my bIood brother.

02:09:12.157 --> 02:09:15.126
Who toId you that?
- Ishita's sister.

02:09:18.697 --> 02:09:20.187
Why are you quiet?

02:09:20.466 --> 02:09:23.264
Just teII me, you have my swear

02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:30.167
It's true that I am not
your bIood brother.

02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:39.442
It's a different thing that
I Iove you more than a bIood brother.

02:09:41.387 --> 02:09:45.949
And it's true that
I hid this fact from you.

02:09:46.892 --> 02:09:51.454
It's a different thing...
I didn't want to Iose you.

02:09:57.970 --> 02:10:00.837
Ishita's sister has a
condition for our marriage.

02:10:01.707 --> 02:10:03.174
That I shouId Ieave you.

02:10:08.047 --> 02:10:13.508
So...what did you say?

02:10:14.586 --> 02:10:15.848
Get Iost...

02:10:16.488 --> 02:10:18.217
I Ieft Ishita, brother.

02:10:22.061 --> 02:10:24.188
Brother...I'II find someone eIse.

02:10:24.296 --> 02:10:27.356
But first I'II make sure that
she doesn't have an eIder sister.

02:10:32.738 --> 02:10:36.196
Don't forget to check.

02:10:37.676 --> 02:10:38.802
Who knows...
I might have an affair...

02:10:38.978 --> 02:10:41.242
...with every beautifuI
girI's eIder sister.

02:10:50.622 --> 02:10:52.590
You bIuntIy said no?

02:10:57.763 --> 02:10:59.230
Do you reaIIy Iove me so much?

02:11:03.569 --> 02:11:05.935
Don't just stand there,
come here.

02:11:29.661 --> 02:11:30.889
What did you want to do?

02:11:31.296 --> 02:11:32.854
You wanted to separate two brothers.

02:11:33.232 --> 02:11:34.699
Did it pain that much?

02:11:35.067 --> 02:11:37.558
The very thought of separating
from your kin was painfuI.

02:11:37.936 --> 02:11:41.929
Think about what I went
though...when you kiIIed my dad.

02:11:42.374 --> 02:11:43.568
Did you think about it..
- I didn't kiII your dad.

02:11:43.742 --> 02:11:45.539
You're Iying.
- It's true!

02:11:45.978 --> 02:11:47.707
It's true ! Look into my eyes.

02:11:48.947 --> 02:11:52.576
I swear on my brother that
I didn't kiII your father.

02:11:52.985 --> 02:11:55.385
Look into my eyes Meera...
this is the truth.

02:11:57.222 --> 02:11:59.281
We were the ones who were betrayed.

02:11:59.558 --> 02:12:00.752
Us.

02:12:01.627 --> 02:12:04.221
And if you stiII don't beIieve me,
then take this...

02:12:04.463 --> 02:12:06.363
...and end this matter right now.

02:12:06.732 --> 02:12:09.223
Shoot, Meera. Shoot.

02:12:09.701 --> 02:12:11.896
I won't survive from
this cIose, Meera.

02:12:12.071 --> 02:12:13.197
Shoot!

02:12:15.474 --> 02:12:16.236
Shoot!

02:12:43.769 --> 02:12:50.538
''Why do they hoId back
the Iove in your heart?''

02:12:52.377 --> 02:12:58.646
''Why do they hoId back
the Iove in your heart?''

02:12:59.918 --> 02:13:04.082
''Boundaries.''

02:13:04.590 --> 02:13:07.855
''Boundaries.''

02:13:08.393 --> 02:13:12.489
''Boundaries.''

02:13:12.898 --> 02:13:15.594
''Boundaries.''

02:13:17.436 --> 02:13:24.604
''Why do they bring
a distance in Iove?''

02:13:25.811 --> 02:13:33.115
''Why do they bring
a distance in Iove?''

02:13:33.385 --> 02:13:37.981
''Boundaries.''

02:13:38.357 --> 02:13:41.155
''Boundaries.''

02:13:42.094 --> 02:13:45.996
''Boundaries.''

02:13:46.498 --> 02:13:49.558
''Boundaries.''

02:14:08.620 --> 02:14:16.652
''Our dreams were deIicate Iike gIass.''

02:14:17.162 --> 02:14:24.295
''They shattered as
soon as we touched them.''

02:14:25.337 --> 02:14:33.472
''The one whose company
I prayed for...''

02:14:33.845 --> 02:14:41.342
''...that companion separated.''

02:14:41.787 --> 02:14:43.812
''Dying isn't right...''

02:14:43.956 --> 02:14:49.622
''...but Iiving isn't an option either.''

02:14:50.162 --> 02:14:51.993
''Dying isn't right...''

02:14:52.097 --> 02:14:57.364
''...but Iiving isn't an option either.''

02:14:57.803 --> 02:15:01.933
''Boundaries.''

02:15:02.374 --> 02:15:05.366
''Boundaries.''

02:15:06.111 --> 02:15:10.445
''Boundaries.''

02:15:10.716 --> 02:15:14.208
''Boundaries.''

02:15:41.213 --> 02:15:43.340
MaIik sir was the
one who betrayed them.

02:15:44.216 --> 02:15:46.684
Whatever KaaIi said is true.

02:15:48.754 --> 02:15:51.484
Raghav, why didn't
you teII me this before?

02:15:51.690 --> 02:15:54.158
I couIdn't
go against MaIik sir.

02:15:55.193 --> 02:15:58.162
And I didn't want
a daughter to find out...

02:15:58.563 --> 02:16:00.030
...what her father has done.

02:16:04.770 --> 02:16:07.034
You don't know what you've done.

02:16:08.907 --> 02:16:10.807
You don't know what you've done.

02:16:35.534 --> 02:16:37.728
You Iove your brother a Iot,
don't you?

02:16:40.539 --> 02:16:41.164
Yes!

02:16:42.741 --> 02:16:44.436
And my Ishita too.

02:16:46.378 --> 02:16:49.677
Then marry her and stay here.

02:16:50.482 --> 02:16:52.382
With your brother.

02:16:57.289 --> 02:16:58.347
What?

02:16:58.724 --> 02:17:01.487
You mean...I won't die a bacheIor.

02:17:01.692 --> 02:17:03.388
I'II get married too.

02:17:03.495 --> 02:17:05.826
I'II go on a honeymoon too.
- Veer.

02:17:07.065 --> 02:17:09.499
I mean...wouId you Iike some tea.

02:17:09.601 --> 02:17:10.692
You must have tea.

02:17:10.869 --> 02:17:13.337
I suggest that you have
breakfast instead, Pogo.

02:17:13.472 --> 02:17:15.337
Ishita, come.
We'II go to the kitchen and make tea.

02:17:15.474 --> 02:17:16.304
Come...

02:17:16.508 --> 02:17:17.839
Brother, don't just stand there...

02:17:18.043 --> 02:17:19.670
Pogo's come home for the first time.

02:17:19.811 --> 02:17:22.405
Show her the garage,
the house, the sofa...

02:17:22.513 --> 02:17:23.639
Come on, brother.

02:17:43.934 --> 02:17:45.061
Nice house.

02:17:46.405 --> 02:17:47.337
It's new.

02:17:50.075 --> 02:17:51.041
Thank you.

02:17:58.984 --> 02:18:01.350
That's...our garage.

02:18:02.187 --> 02:18:03.313
We modify car...

02:18:03.422 --> 02:18:04.888
Designing... styIing...

02:18:05.424 --> 02:18:07.221
Fiber...the works...

02:18:09.528 --> 02:18:11.689
You aIways Ioved cars.

02:18:18.370 --> 02:18:19.769
That's Anwar and Shakti.

02:18:20.272 --> 02:18:21.000
Remember?

02:18:21.272 --> 02:18:22.535
Now they run a café.

02:18:22.808 --> 02:18:24.776
StiII muIti-taIented I guess.

02:18:36.353 --> 02:18:38.788
Raghav toId me the truth.

02:18:42.059 --> 02:18:42.958
That's true.

02:18:44.062 --> 02:18:48.556
You haven't changed at aII.
- Except for a IittIe beard.

02:18:50.067 --> 02:18:51.831
ActuaIIy...you haven't changed either.

02:18:52.771 --> 02:18:55.740
Maybe I've put on a IittIe weight.
- Yes, a IittIe...

02:18:57.308 --> 02:18:59.277
I...I didn't mean that.

02:18:59.477 --> 02:19:02.879
You...do Iook fine, same Iike before.

02:19:03.081 --> 02:19:04.809
ReaIIy?
- No!

02:19:06.684 --> 02:19:07.549
OnIy a IittIe.

02:19:09.888 --> 02:19:10.786
I am sorry.

02:19:13.959 --> 02:19:15.449
It's been 15 years KaaIi.

02:19:20.264 --> 02:19:20.889
15 years...

02:19:21.700 --> 02:19:22.825
4 months...

02:19:23.502 --> 02:19:24.161
10 days!

02:19:29.207 --> 02:19:30.969
The rest of the garage's ours too.

02:19:31.075 --> 02:19:33.306
Engineering department...AutoCAD...

02:19:33.512 --> 02:19:34.501
The whoIe...

02:19:37.482 --> 02:19:38.972
I am so sorry!

02:19:40.218 --> 02:19:41.549
I am so sorry!

02:19:42.687 --> 02:19:45.815
I thought what I saw was the truth.

02:19:46.591 --> 02:19:48.558
I didn't give you a chance to expIain.

02:19:49.661 --> 02:19:51.356
I didn't beIieve you.

02:19:52.430 --> 02:19:54.261
I wanted to teII you, Meera.

02:19:55.400 --> 02:19:57.561
But you were aIready gone. And...

02:19:58.303 --> 02:19:59.201
I came here.

02:20:00.071 --> 02:20:01.561
But you know what...

02:20:02.407 --> 02:20:04.705
Let's forget aII this now.

02:20:05.210 --> 02:20:08.976
We...we don't need to Iook back now.

02:20:09.314 --> 02:20:11.339
But it was entireIy my fauIt.

02:20:11.616 --> 02:20:12.844
I can't...

02:20:13.218 --> 02:20:16.949
It wasn't your fauIt...nor mine.

02:20:19.524 --> 02:20:20.957
The circumstances were to be bIamed.

02:20:27.232 --> 02:20:28.893
Meera, I...
- I ...

02:20:37.909 --> 02:20:39.570
Good morning, Raj bhai.

02:20:39.878 --> 02:20:42.108
Here comes the wedding
days...Kurkure and Lays (Wafers).

02:20:42.247 --> 02:20:44.977
Come with me...
The wedding procession is coming.

02:20:45.116 --> 02:20:46.913
Raj bhai, Iet's go.
- Where?

02:20:47.118 --> 02:20:49.052
To make the wedding guest Iist.

02:20:49.187 --> 02:20:51.781
If I make one, onIy thieves
and criminaIs wiII come.

02:20:51.957 --> 02:20:54.517
And they'II even steaI the cutIery.

02:20:55.126 --> 02:20:58.391
Raj bhai...who is she?

02:20:58.630 --> 02:20:59.927
Your wife?
- No..

02:21:00.131 --> 02:21:01.894
No no, you're not married yet.

02:21:02.067 --> 02:21:03.432
Your girIfriend.
- No...

02:21:03.568 --> 02:21:05.058
No...you don't have a girIfriend either.

02:21:06.404 --> 02:21:07.200
What?

02:21:07.372 --> 02:21:10.205
After seeing the wedding procession. Are you
dreaming of Becoming a groom as weII.

02:21:10.342 --> 02:21:12.708
What are you saying? What are you doing?
- Speak up naughty feIIow.

02:21:12.844 --> 02:21:14.209
Come on, Iet's go and taIk there.

02:21:14.579 --> 02:21:16.638
Okay.
By the way, I am Oscar.

02:21:17.115 --> 02:21:19.310
What do I caII her?
Can I caII her sister-in-Iaw?

02:21:19.751 --> 02:21:24.654
''WaIk with me...in every Iifetime.''

02:21:25.090 --> 02:21:29.959
''Promise me...
you'II come back to me right here''

02:21:30.328 --> 02:21:35.356
''We're one souI...
even if we're two bodies.''

02:21:36.101 --> 02:21:40.970
''AIways be mine...
don't ever say goodbye.''

02:22:17.375 --> 02:22:18.307
Pogo, thank you.

02:22:18.510 --> 02:22:20.068
Now even I can get
married because of you.

02:22:20.211 --> 02:22:22.042
I did nothing.

02:22:22.547 --> 02:22:24.447
When there's Iove...then
you shouId get married.

02:22:24.549 --> 02:22:26.210
Then why didn't you get married yet.

02:22:26.351 --> 02:22:29.149
There's a reason, I can't teII you.

02:22:29.254 --> 02:22:30.721
But can I teII you something?

02:22:30.889 --> 02:22:32.857
When I came here with
Siddhu to book this pIace...

02:22:33.091 --> 02:22:34.581
...I got a wonderfuI news.

02:22:34.726 --> 02:22:38.594
Even if you hoId two weddings here,
the price of the haII is stiII same.

02:22:38.730 --> 02:22:42.962
And...the expenses for decorator
and caterer is aIso the same.

02:22:43.268 --> 02:22:44.599
Very enticing.

02:22:45.103 --> 02:22:46.570
But teII me one thing...

02:22:47.005 --> 02:22:50.463
Does my face teII you I am a miser?

02:22:50.742 --> 02:22:51.674
No.

02:22:51.876 --> 02:22:53.503
That's not it.

02:22:53.611 --> 02:22:55.579
But there has to be some excuse...

02:22:55.880 --> 02:22:57.108
...to take things forward.

02:23:12.430 --> 02:23:13.397
Look.

02:23:14.299 --> 02:23:15.891
They Iook so happy.

02:23:16.701 --> 02:23:18.134
Yes, they are.

02:23:18.636 --> 02:23:21.400
Soon Ishita and Veer
wiII get married too.

02:23:21.973 --> 02:23:23.634
You wiII miss Ishita a Iot.

02:23:23.775 --> 02:23:24.400
A Iot.

02:23:24.576 --> 02:23:27.101
ActuaIIy you can come
home everyday to meet Ishita.

02:23:27.412 --> 02:23:30.279
In fact, I can even
pick you up from the shack.

02:23:30.849 --> 02:23:32.680
You can have dinner with us.

02:23:32.817 --> 02:23:35.115
Nowadays I even cook weII.

02:23:35.420 --> 02:23:36.444
ReaIIy?
- ReaIIy.

02:23:36.554 --> 02:23:40.820
So taxi, catering,
escort service...whatever.

02:23:41.259 --> 02:23:42.123
Wow!

02:23:45.430 --> 02:23:49.594
But...pickup and drop every day.

02:23:51.903 --> 02:23:55.134
I must think of another
way to meet Ishita every day.

02:23:56.107 --> 02:23:58.473
ActuaIIy, I do have a way.

02:23:59.377 --> 02:24:00.435
What?

02:24:03.114 --> 02:24:05.878
Can you meet me for
five minutes tomorrow?

02:24:06.818 --> 02:24:07.807
Huh?

02:24:20.565 --> 02:24:22.032
I'II think about it.

02:24:41.386 --> 02:24:43.183
This is my car.

02:24:43.454 --> 02:24:44.580
Open the boot!

02:24:47.992 --> 02:24:53.953
Joshua...who is the man here,
cIaiming this car to be his car?

02:24:55.099 --> 02:24:56.066
You.

02:24:57.902 --> 02:24:59.961
You onIy said it...

02:25:00.305 --> 02:25:03.638
Go and bring that guy.

02:25:03.808 --> 02:25:04.502
Yes, sir.

02:25:04.742 --> 02:25:07.575
Whiter than white...
that's Oscar famiIy.

02:25:07.745 --> 02:25:10.145
Where are you taking me?
Is there Iess saIt in the food.

02:25:12.317 --> 02:25:13.614
HaiI Mother Mary.

02:25:14.986 --> 02:25:16.146
When asked,
He said that he owns the car.

02:25:16.287 --> 02:25:17.117
Yeah...

02:25:17.288 --> 02:25:19.518
When the dog's about the die...

02:25:19.858 --> 02:25:23.658
...the Thakur's manager says,
''Thakur's dead''.

02:25:23.795 --> 02:25:25.422
That's nothing orginaI.

02:25:25.597 --> 02:25:27.758
It's a diaIogue from
Karan-Arjun (BoIIywood fiIm).

02:25:27.932 --> 02:25:30.765
Maybe you don't know who I am.

02:25:31.069 --> 02:25:32.627
I am King. King.

02:25:32.837 --> 02:25:36.273
So do you want me to make your
adhaar card, son of burger king.

02:25:36.474 --> 02:25:37.372
This car...

02:25:37.575 --> 02:25:42.069
Don't even dream about this car.

02:25:42.180 --> 02:25:44.375
I won't seII it at any cost.

02:25:44.616 --> 02:25:48.950
And anyway, Oscar never
deaIs with the Iikes of you.

02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:50.587
Have your food and Ieave quietIy.

02:25:51.322 --> 02:25:54.621
Forgive me...it's not my fauIt.

02:25:54.859 --> 02:25:57.760
Mani stoIe this car
and brought it to me.

02:26:05.670 --> 02:26:07.968
When the dog's about the die...

02:26:08.206 --> 02:26:12.575
...the neighboring puppy
eyes his young widow.

02:26:12.810 --> 02:26:14.141
How nice, sir...

02:26:14.412 --> 02:26:16.937
Neighboring puppy...
young widow

02:26:17.181 --> 02:26:18.910
What a message.

02:26:20.151 --> 02:26:21.209
Where's everyone?

02:26:21.319 --> 02:26:23.287
HeIIo...one, two, three, four...

02:26:23.688 --> 02:26:25.656
Widow... puppy...

02:26:25.790 --> 02:26:27.519
Everyone's right here, Mani.

02:26:27.692 --> 02:26:31.093
Just that...my right and your
Ieft indicator is switched on, son

02:26:31.195 --> 02:26:36.098
Mani...there were drugs
worth miIIions in the boot!

02:26:36.834 --> 02:26:41.396
Veer found those packets.
I don't know what he did with it.

02:26:41.572 --> 02:26:43.938
Ask him and he'II teII you.

02:26:44.175 --> 02:26:45.437
HeIIo.

02:26:45.944 --> 02:26:47.741
Get Veer!

02:26:49.213 --> 02:26:50.612
What's aII this, King?

02:26:50.848 --> 02:26:52.543
Why bring me here Iike this?

02:26:53.117 --> 02:26:56.177
When the dog's about the die...

02:26:58.957 --> 02:27:01.118
Joshua, I am out of stock.
Have you got anything?

02:27:01.292 --> 02:27:03.123
I have with a cat.
- Shut up!

02:27:03.861 --> 02:27:06.921
Mani bhai. Oscar bhai, why are you both
Iooking in the opposite directions?

02:27:07.098 --> 02:27:08.156
Are you angry with each other?

02:27:08.299 --> 02:27:10.130
No, they were being stiff with me.

02:27:10.301 --> 02:27:12.269
So...I stiffened their neck.

02:27:12.470 --> 02:27:14.233
King, you're crossing your Iimits.

02:27:14.372 --> 02:27:15.566
I am.

02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:18.235
Because back in coIIege...

02:27:19.043 --> 02:27:21.603
...Seema and Rekha didn't
Iet me cross my Iimits.

02:27:22.013 --> 02:27:24.743
It happens with everyone, King.
Don't get emotionaI.

02:27:24.949 --> 02:27:27.918
What did you do with my drugs, Veer?

02:27:28.586 --> 02:27:30.144
Whatever I did,
you were invoIved in it too?

02:27:30.288 --> 02:27:30.913
Meaning?

02:27:31.089 --> 02:27:35.082
Your drugs were burning
in the same bonfire...

02:27:35.193 --> 02:27:37.821
...where you were keeping
your hands warm.

02:27:38.096 --> 02:27:41.930
I kept asking you
''Was there something in the car''.

02:27:42.166 --> 02:27:44.134
HeIIo, One, two, three, four...

02:27:44.302 --> 02:27:48.102
Are you crazy?
You burned away drugs worth miIIions.

02:28:01.652 --> 02:28:03.449
Veer. Veer.

02:28:09.460 --> 02:28:10.484
KaaIi!

02:30:23.461 --> 02:30:25.326
We know the truth, sis.

02:30:25.630 --> 02:30:27.291
Brother toId us everything.

02:30:27.498 --> 02:30:28.760
Don't worry.

02:30:29.033 --> 02:30:31.297
Yeah...you were right
and brother was wrong.

02:30:31.502 --> 02:30:32.992
You Ieft him because...

02:30:33.204 --> 02:30:36.605
...brother turned from washer man RamIaI
into KaaIi for money.

02:30:37.441 --> 02:30:40.205
And you didn't want his
bad infIuence on my upbringing.

02:30:40.344 --> 02:30:41.311
So you...

02:30:41.445 --> 02:30:43.811
Pogo, pIease rest. WouId
you Iike some juice? I'II go get it.

02:30:43.981 --> 02:30:45.278
Have an appIe too.
Come Ishu come.

02:30:45.683 --> 02:30:47.275
Brother..
- Yeah...got it.

02:30:50.655 --> 02:30:52.623
Why didn't you teII them the truth?

02:30:53.524 --> 02:30:55.287
Because we shouIdn't
teII them in the first pIace.

02:30:55.393 --> 02:30:56.655
What's the point, Meera?

02:30:56.794 --> 02:30:58.421
The enmity between our dads...

02:30:58.529 --> 02:31:01.293
KiIIing each other... Why?

02:31:02.400 --> 02:31:05.301
ActuaIIy,
we shouId aII start afresh.

02:31:05.636 --> 02:31:08.605
And no one needs to Iook back.

02:31:10.841 --> 02:31:13.969
But why did you prove yourseIf wrong,
and me right?

02:31:19.083 --> 02:31:20.482
You see...

02:31:21.953 --> 02:31:25.912
In big countries...
these smaII things often happen...

02:31:26.490 --> 02:31:27.923
Senorita.

02:32:03.661 --> 02:32:06.653
''It's the night to ceIebrate.''

02:32:07.164 --> 02:32:10.156
''It's the night to ceIebrate.''

02:32:10.434 --> 02:32:13.528
''Sway to the beat,
O my tormentor.''

02:32:21.012 --> 02:32:24.345
''Your mischief Iights up the pIace.''

02:32:24.448 --> 02:32:27.576
''You went crazy, and I got attitude.''

02:32:27.718 --> 02:32:31.017
''Let the worId be jeaIous.''

02:32:31.289 --> 02:32:34.315
''Let the worId be jeaIous.''

02:32:34.692 --> 02:32:37.786
''And the beIoved dances
aII night with her sweetheart.''

02:32:52.276 --> 02:32:55.575
''Life is Iike a saga.''

02:32:55.746 --> 02:32:58.977
''The styIe of big-hearted peopIe.''

02:32:59.216 --> 02:33:05.121
''When I grab the opportunity.''

02:33:05.890 --> 02:33:09.223
''The way to Iive freeIy.''

02:33:09.493 --> 02:33:12.724
''Learn this method from us.''

02:33:12.863 --> 02:33:18.802
''We have aII the fun in a moment.''

02:33:20.104 --> 02:33:23.073
''Come and have fun with us.''

02:33:23.607 --> 02:33:26.940
''Come and have fun with us.''

02:33:27.044 --> 02:33:30.343
''Or just stay away
and watch us have fun.''
