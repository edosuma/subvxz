John, this depo from Chelsea
changes everything.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.310
That doesn't make sense for Meg.

02:24.894 --> 02:27.230
She's had no history
of domestic violence or abuse.

02:27.313 --> 02:29.190
She's gonna be characterized
as the angry ex

02:29.274 --> 02:31.484
for whatever reason
their engagement fell off.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.403
So, it's gonna devolve
into a "he said, she said."

02:33.486 --> 02:35.405
But we're missing the "she said" part.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.866
Of course,
her DNA is gonna be found at Marco's.

after the man was murdered.

people all brought the same flowers.

08:39.769 --> 08:40.895

08:44.440 --> 08:45.983
I wanna ask you something.

08:48.903 --> 08:49.779
Okay.

08:51.614 --> 08:52.698
It's about Meg.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.411
-What about her?
-Have you talked to Meg, Mom?

08:57.828 --> 08:59.664
Have you had any contact with her?

09:01.290 --> 09:02.458
How many times are you--?

09:02.542 --> 09:05.711
I'm gonna keep asking you about it,
because if she doesn't come back here,

09:06.379 --> 09:07.713
they're gonna make her a suspect.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.757
And the fact that nobody in this family

09:09.840 --> 09:12.677
has heard from her
makes her look very guilty.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.303
I don't know where she is, John.

09:23.604 --> 09:25.314
Her car is still in the parking lot.

Weren't you supposed to sell her car?

09:27.191 --> 09:30.570
I know.
I just haven't gotten around to it.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.364
Is that because you think
she's gonna need it

09:33.447 --> 09:36.742
when she comes back after the trial,
or is that something she told you?

09:36.826 --> 09:39.078

-You are not protecting her.

this whole thing could go sideways.

I shouldn't even have called you.
I appreciate you trying to help.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.966
Okay? But that's your inheritance.

10:34.050 --> 10:37.178
There's a reason your dad didn't want you
to come down to the Keys.

10:37.261 --> 10:38.971
He didn't bring you down here,
he didn't want you to meet

10:39.055 --> 10:40.848
that fucking family, and that money...

10:41.474 --> 10:42.683
It's your ticket out.

10:43.601 --> 10:44.518
I'll do it.

10:45.102 --> 10:47.229
I'll cover any other legal fees.

10:47.813 --> 10:51.025
Any cost to further discovery,
I'll do my best to limit.

10:51.692 --> 10:54.236
And I can still follow up
with Chelsea's deposition,

10:54.320 --> 10:56.489
and I can fact-check within our budget.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.074
What do you mean, "follow up"?

10:58.157 --> 11:00.826
Well, right now it's her word
against Kevin Rayburn's.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.621
And it would be better
if we had corroborating evidence

11:03.913 --> 11:08.376
that proved that she actually drove
Meg Rayburn to Marco's house.

11:08.459 --> 11:11.796
-Do we have time to try and find that?
-[Mia] No.

11:12.129 --> 11:14.924
Which means I'm gonna have to ask
the judge for a stay.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.009
What the fuck is a stay?

11:17.093 --> 11:20.429
Basically, I would petition the judge
to postpone the trial,

11:20.513 --> 11:22.807
and it's highly unlikely
that she'll grant it.

11:23.224 --> 11:26.143
-But it's possible?
-You'll talk to the judge this morning?

11:26.727 --> 11:27.603
I'll try.

11:28.229 --> 11:29.563

-What are you gonna say?
-He's not talking.

-Hey.
-[Brandon] Family.

-You ready?
-Yep.

-Easy-breezy.
-I got this. Enough, okay?

12:15.943 --> 12:19.738
After you received the call
from Marco Diaz, what happened?

12:19.822 --> 12:21.490
I walked over to his house.

12:22.741 --> 12:23.742
[Brandon] You walked?

12:24.368 --> 12:26.412
Uh, yes, sir. I had a suspended license.

12:26.829 --> 12:29.623
-Why is that?
-I had some drug issues last year.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.501
I got into a car accident and I got a DUI.

12:33.043 --> 12:34.545
Were you sober
when you walked to see Marco?

12:34.628 --> 12:35.504
Yes, sir.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.299
How long had you been sober
prior to that night?

12:38.841 --> 12:40.468
Uh... One month, 30 days.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.971
I went into AA
the day after the accident, so...

12:44.054 --> 12:45.431
I just got my six-month chip.

12:46.265 --> 12:47.641
Well, congratulations.

12:48.893 --> 12:52.271
What did you see...
when you arrived at Marco's?

12:52.855 --> 12:56.192
Well, first I heard arguing
as I approached the door.

12:56.609 --> 12:59.028
-And then?
-Through the glass of the front door,

12:59.487 --> 13:01.989
I saw Marco get hit in the head.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.449
And then what happened?

13:03.532 --> 13:05.743
I tried to stop it,
but I got there too late.

13:06.118 --> 13:09.205
Marco was already getting hit
over and over again.

13:11.624 --> 13:12.958
I didn't know what to do.

13:13.709 --> 13:17.505
So, um... I yelled something and, um...

13:20.049 --> 13:22.927
Yeah, I tried to stop it, but it--
It was-- It was awful.

13:24.553 --> 13:25.804
That's when I got shot.

13:26.972 --> 13:30.601
Is the person that shot you
in this courtroom today?

13:33.103 --> 13:34.063
Kevin?

13:35.064 --> 13:40.110
Can you identify the person
that you saw kill Marco Diaz?

13:40.194 --> 13:42.738
-Yes, sir.
-Will you please point them out to us?

13:43.989 --> 13:45.241
He's sitting right there.

13:45.324 --> 13:47.076
-[gasping]
-[murmuring]

13:47.159 --> 13:48.202
Eric O'Bannon.

13:50.829 --> 13:52.915
He killed Marco, and then he shot me.

13:55.834 --> 13:58.587
Mr. Rayburn,
I'd like to ask you one further question.

13:59.380 --> 14:02.424
When you were at Marco Diaz's house,
did you see anyone else

14:02.508 --> 14:04.927
other than the defendant and Marco?

14:05.511 --> 14:06.345
No, sir.

14:06.929 --> 14:07.888
You didn't see your wife?

14:08.722 --> 14:10.766
-No.
-Did you see your sister?

14:11.475 --> 14:12.351
No.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.396
-Your brother?
-No.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.732
Any other relatives, family members?

14:18.816 --> 14:22.403
Aunts, uncles, cousins?

14:22.987 --> 14:23.863
No.

14:24.446 --> 14:25.322
No.

14:27.491 --> 14:29.034
Nothing further, Your Honor.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.828
Miss Santos, cross?

14:30.911 --> 14:31.871
Where's John?

14:32.454 --> 14:33.289
I don't know.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.835
Let's go back to the night of the murder.

14:40.045 --> 14:42.882
I'm a little confused.
Maybe you can clarify something.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.259
-I'll try.
-I'm sure you will.

14:45.968 --> 14:48.429
I have your cell phone records
in front of me.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.015
On the night of the murder,
your sister, Meg,

14:51.098 --> 14:52.558
called you several times.

14:52.641 --> 14:55.561
Why was she trying so desperately
to get in touch with you?

14:56.145 --> 14:57.813
I don't know. I never spoke to her.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.315
You'd have to ask her.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.984
Unfortunately,
since she's disappeared, we can't.

15:02.067 --> 15:03.694
Objection, Your Honor. Speculation.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.279
Sustained. Careful, counselor.

15:05.362 --> 15:06.530
Yes, Your Honor.

15:06.614 --> 15:09.033
Did your sister leave you any voicemails?

15:09.617 --> 15:11.577
Yes. She just asked me to call her back.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.287
And why didn't you do that?

15:13.370 --> 15:15.080
Why didn't you take her calls?

15:15.164 --> 15:16.540
Do you have any siblings?

15:18.167 --> 15:20.920
Sometimes you don't wanna deal
with family stuff, you know?

15:21.003 --> 15:23.005
I just wasn't in the mood.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.173
[Mia] I see.

15:24.506 --> 15:27.593
And these records also show
that you called your brother, John,

15:27.968 --> 15:29.470
seven times that night.

15:30.054 --> 15:33.390
That seems unusual. Why were you
so intent on getting in touch with him?

15:36.477 --> 15:37.311
Um...

15:39.480 --> 15:41.065
Mr. Rayburn, I asked you a question.

15:42.858 --> 15:45.986
Why were you trying so desperately
to get in touch with John?

15:46.070 --> 15:47.947
-Objection, Your Honor.
-Sustained.

15:48.238 --> 15:49.365
Rephrase it, counselor.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.867
Why did you call your brother,
John, seven times?

15:53.035 --> 15:55.412
-I had to talk to him.
-Well, these records indicate

15:55.496 --> 15:57.831
that you did speak to him
for several moments.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.751
What was that about?
Why did you need to talk to him?

16:04.421 --> 16:06.423
My wife was pregnant at the time.

16:07.007 --> 16:10.678
And, uh... she was having
some abdominal pains.

16:11.053 --> 16:15.391
And so I called John to see if he thought
we should go to the hospital,

16:15.474 --> 16:17.601
because he has kids.
I thought he would know.

16:19.561 --> 16:22.106
Why didn't you mention that
when we spoke about Meg's calls?

16:23.315 --> 16:24.274
Forgot.

16:24.358 --> 16:25.275
[Mia] Really?

16:26.110 --> 16:29.613
Because you remember everything perfectly
in the hours that followed.

16:29.697 --> 16:32.408
But you forgot that your wife's pregnancy
was in danger?

16:32.491 --> 16:34.868
I was shot twice that night.
I remember that.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.996
[indistinct murmuring]

16:41.417 --> 16:43.002
Let's talk about your family.

16:43.460 --> 16:45.379
You seem incredibly close-knit.

16:46.338 --> 16:47.506
[sighs]

16:48.632 --> 16:51.510
-Sorry, was that a question?
-Do you think you're close-knit?

16:52.094 --> 16:54.054
-I guess.
-Thirty years ago,

16:54.138 --> 16:55.848
there was a tragedy in your family.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.642
[Brandon] Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

16:59.226 --> 17:00.686
It goes to credibility.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.313
There's only one eyewitness to this crime,

17:03.397 --> 17:05.024
so we could use some leeway here.

17:05.607 --> 17:07.651
I'll allow it.
Don't stray too far though.

17:07.735 --> 17:08.694
[Mia] Thank you.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.155
So, this tragedy, what happened?

17:12.072 --> 17:13.198
My sister died.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.826
Now, this is your older sister,
Sarah, correct?

17:15.909 --> 17:17.536
-Yes.
-And what happened?

17:22.207 --> 17:24.168
She drowned.
It was a boating accident.

17:24.835 --> 17:26.086
[Mia] I'm sorry.

17:27.546 --> 17:30.924
And that same day, your brother,
Danny, ended up in the hospital.

17:31.008 --> 17:31.925
How did that happen?

17:32.551 --> 17:35.262
Um, I-- He was hit by a car, I think.

17:35.596 --> 17:36.472
You don't know?

17:37.347 --> 17:39.308
I was a little kid.
I barely remember it.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.101
And your family didn't talk about it?

17:41.185 --> 17:43.145
It was painful for us.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.313
It still is.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.689
[Mia] I'm sure.

17:46.690 --> 17:49.818
Your father blamed Danny
for your sister's death, didn't he?

17:50.152 --> 17:54.073
And isn't it true that your brother,
Danny, wasn't hit by a truck?

17:54.656 --> 17:55.908
[Brandon] Your Honor, please.

17:56.408 --> 18:00.204
That your father beat him up so badly
that he ended up in the hospital?

18:00.287 --> 18:01.789
Isn't that what really happened?

18:01.872 --> 18:04.208
-I don't remember.
-Counselor, I'm warning you.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.210
-I'm getting there.
-Then you get there faster.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.588
And that your family covered
for your father.

18:09.671 --> 18:13.008
Isn't it true that your family lied
to the police to protect him?

18:13.092 --> 18:14.593
I don't know.

18:15.594 --> 18:19.098
Doesn't your family have a history
of covering for each other?

18:19.181 --> 18:20.766
-[Brandon] Objection.
-Sustained.

18:21.558 --> 18:23.519
[Mia] When you were arrested
for drug possession,

18:23.602 --> 18:25.479
didn't your sister, Meg, represent you?

18:25.562 --> 18:26.522
Yes.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.982
And she got you a plea? No jail time?

18:29.066 --> 18:30.943
-Yes.
-That's a sweet deal.

18:31.527 --> 18:34.780
You must have been grateful to her.
You must have owed her big-time.

18:34.863 --> 18:36.615
-[Brandon] Objection.
-Withdrawn.

18:37.366 --> 18:39.910
Let's go back to the phone calls from Meg.

18:41.829 --> 18:44.706
If Meg was in trouble,
wouldn't you be the first phone call

18:44.790 --> 18:47.417
-that she would make?
-Objection, calls for speculation.

18:47.501 --> 18:48.794
Sustained.

18:48.877 --> 18:51.171
Isn't it true
that it wasn't Marco who called you

18:51.255 --> 18:52.756
to come to the house that night?

18:52.840 --> 18:54.716
-It was your sister, Meg.
-No.

18:54.800 --> 18:58.720
Meg called you,
the one person that owed her

18:58.804 --> 19:00.889
and that loved her enough
to take a bullet for her.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.099
That is not true.

19:02.182 --> 19:06.186
And that you called John Rayburn,
your brother, seven times,

19:06.270 --> 19:09.022
-to frame Eric O'Bannon for the murder...
-[Kevin] That's not what happened.

19:09.106 --> 19:12.067
-...that your sister, Meg, committed.
-That is not what happened.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.778
Your Honor,
the Rayburn family is not on trial here.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.655
My objection still stands.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.448
Sustained. Counselor.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.200
I apologize, Your Honor. My mistake.

19:21.743 --> 19:24.454
I withdraw the question.
I'm done with this witness.

19:35.799 --> 19:37.134
[bailiff] Thank you, Mr. Rayburn.

Would've broken your daddy's heart
to see you leave the way you did.

24:16.413 --> 24:18.290
You didn't even press your dress.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.127
I was in a hurry to get away.

24:22.210 --> 24:24.713
Leaving us for a man
who didn't even give you a ring.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.176
Now your Meg is giving you
a taste of your own medicine.

24:29.968 --> 24:31.970
Don't talk about her like you know her.

24:34.139 --> 24:35.765
She'd never do that to me.

24:36.766 --> 24:39.102
Then why are you sitting out here
worrying about her?

24:40.312 --> 24:41.688
You wouldn't understand.

24:42.856 --> 24:43.732
No?

24:50.197 --> 24:51.323
Night like this...

24:52.282 --> 24:53.241
takes me back.

24:56.786 --> 24:57.829
You remember?

25:02.459 --> 25:04.794
You make sure
the boy's car had seat belts?

25:05.295 --> 25:08.381
She's not with a boy, Mama.
She's grown.

25:09.007 --> 25:12.844
Before you were out of your training bras,
I started making them come inside first.

25:13.470 --> 25:14.971
You put the fear of God in them.

25:15.889 --> 25:17.182
She'll come back.

25:18.475 --> 25:19.643
I wouldn't be so sure.

25:19.726 --> 25:20.852
[scoffs]

25:22.020 --> 25:23.396
I don't have to listen to this.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.899
[phone ringing]

25:28.568 --> 25:29.402
Hello?

25:30.403 --> 25:31.905
Yes, this is Sally Rayburn.

25:32.948 --> 25:35.825
Oh, yes, of course I remember, Mr. Marx.

25:37.702 --> 25:38.662
Is something wrong?

25:39.955 --> 25:41.831
You know it's that time, birthday girl.

25:41.915 --> 25:44.042
-What?
-We are all waiting to see it.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.586
-See what?
-Oh, you know.

25:47.045 --> 25:49.047
You know. Oh, stop.

25:49.130 --> 25:51.549
You mean, a little of this?

25:51.633 --> 25:53.927
-[man] Yeah!
-Or a little of...

25:54.427 --> 25:55.428
this?

25:55.512 --> 25:56.638
[laughing]

25:56.972 --> 25:59.307
-That's fantastic.
-[Will] Not the hometown girl

25:59.391 --> 26:01.643
-you grew up with anymore, huh?
-She's sure not.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.061
Thanks to LC.

26:03.895 --> 26:08.233
My shop is just four blocks down,
past those red lights.

26:09.192 --> 26:10.026
On the left.

26:10.777 --> 26:11.611
Huh.

26:11.695 --> 26:12.988
Do you have a tattoo?

26:13.488 --> 26:15.407
No, I don't. No.

26:15.490 --> 26:17.575
His mother would kill him.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.411
She would.

26:20.453 --> 26:23.331
[sighs] I love it here.

26:24.916 --> 26:27.002
You can see the ocean on a clear day.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.588
I like that you can see
over people's heads.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.340
[laughing]

26:32.799 --> 26:34.718
Do you ever get that feeling
when you're somewhere high,

26:34.801 --> 26:36.886
like you wanna jump?

26:36.970 --> 26:38.972
Oh, yeah, yeah. I've-- I've had that.

26:39.556 --> 26:41.141
How about that feeling when you wanna...

26:42.934 --> 26:44.602
When you wanna push someone?

26:47.147 --> 26:49.024
-[laughter]
-[Meg] There's a name for it.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.026
[laughing continues]

26:51.109 --> 26:52.235
There's a name for it.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.279
Oh, no, here she goes again, knowing shit.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.573
[speaks in French]

26:56.656 --> 26:58.783
The call of-- Um...

26:58.867 --> 27:01.161
Tenth grade French failing me.

27:01.244 --> 27:05.248
-[laughs] "The call of the void."
-Wait. I didn't know you knew French.

27:05.332 --> 27:06.791
Surprises all around.

27:06.875 --> 27:08.001
She knows French.

27:08.084 --> 27:10.587
And she got cute friends.

27:10.670 --> 27:13.923
What else are you hiding up
that soon-to-be tatted sleeve?

27:14.507 --> 27:15.550
That's it for me.

27:15.633 --> 27:17.635
Give us some dirt on the birthday girl.

27:18.219 --> 27:19.554
No, my lips are sealed.

27:19.637 --> 27:21.139
I will drink to that.

27:21.598 --> 27:23.433
Happy birthday, Ames!

27:23.516 --> 27:25.727
[cheering and whooping]

27:25.810 --> 27:26.686
Thank you.

27:26.770 --> 27:27.937
[chattering]

27:32.525 --> 27:34.152
I-- I don't understand.

27:34.652 --> 27:37.030
Your family was slandered today,
Ms. Rayburn.

27:37.322 --> 27:40.158
You mean, all that nonsense with Meg?

27:40.533 --> 27:42.077
No, I'm talking about the past,

27:42.160 --> 27:44.037
what happened
with your husband and your son.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.332
We think you'd be the best person
to refute that.

27:47.415 --> 27:49.042
You want me to testify?

27:49.125 --> 27:52.003
Mrs. Rayburn, you have a great standing
in this community.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.381
Your family name means something.

27:55.048 --> 27:59.302
A pier's dedicated to you,
charitable contributions... [scoffs]

28:00.053 --> 28:02.764
Almost 50 years of business at your inn.

28:05.225 --> 28:07.852
Do you really want these insinuations
to go unanswered?

28:07.936 --> 28:09.187
You could dispel them.

28:09.270 --> 28:10.939
Well, what if Meg came back?

28:11.022 --> 28:12.816
Do you have information
about where she is?

28:14.317 --> 28:16.111
No, I just...

28:18.446 --> 28:20.073
I just thought it might help.

28:20.156 --> 28:21.241
[Brandon] Of course it would.

28:22.158 --> 28:23.743
Right now she's a phantom.

28:24.452 --> 28:27.038
The defense can paint
any picture of her they want to.

28:27.580 --> 28:28.915
But you could rebut that.

28:30.583 --> 28:32.877
You could give Meg a human face.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.297
I'll get back to you, Mr. Marx.

28:46.391 --> 28:48.393
[John] How does it feel to be 35 again?

28:49.227 --> 28:51.104
It's a great excuse to have a party.

28:52.063 --> 28:53.898
And since when do you like parties?

28:56.609 --> 28:58.903
Since my family is not at them.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.408
I got your message.

29:05.618 --> 29:06.578
I'm not coming home.

29:13.209 --> 29:16.588
You realize that Eric's defense
is attempting to make you a suspect?

29:16.671 --> 29:18.173
I said, I got the message.

29:20.383 --> 29:23.511
I mean, I thought at least
once you heard that you could at least...

29:23.803 --> 29:25.764
give me a fucking call or something.

29:26.222 --> 29:28.475
Why? I knew you would track me down.

29:37.192 --> 29:39.152
You don't care what people are saying?

29:41.112 --> 29:42.655
I don't want any part of it.

29:43.364 --> 29:46.743
If they can't find me,
they cannot force me to testify.

29:51.247 --> 29:52.248
What about Mom?

29:54.667 --> 29:55.752
What about Mom?

29:56.336 --> 29:58.213
Don't you think that Mom needs you?

29:59.380 --> 30:00.673
I think you need me.

30:02.258 --> 30:04.260
I think you and Kevin need me.

30:04.844 --> 30:07.847
And I would rather stay
and hide forever...

30:08.681 --> 30:11.100
than go back and lie in court.

30:18.107 --> 30:19.067
How long you staying?

30:22.070 --> 30:25.490
-When we used to play hide-and-seek--
-Oh, my God. I hated it.

30:28.201 --> 30:29.577
It was just a game.

30:30.203 --> 30:31.162
To you.

30:31.663 --> 30:35.792
Oh, my God. You have no idea
what it was like for me growing up.

30:35.875 --> 30:37.752
I was never good enough.

30:38.169 --> 30:40.296
You wouldn't let me win even once.

30:40.380 --> 30:42.340
And what did you guys used to say to me?

30:44.509 --> 30:45.343
"Hide better."

30:49.264 --> 30:51.224
I finally feel like me, John.

30:52.225 --> 30:53.059
Hmm.

30:53.601 --> 30:58.481
I'm not going back home to feel
like that kid again and hate myself.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.066
I'm not going.

31:03.361 --> 31:04.362
Okay.

31:06.990 --> 31:07.991
Sorry.

31:54.704 --> 31:56.289
[creaking]

31:56.372 --> 31:57.707
[footsteps]

31:59.751 --> 32:00.585
[Meg] Ma!

32:00.668 --> 32:01.920
[groans]

32:53.471 --> 32:54.889
Hi. Can we make this quick?

32:54.973 --> 32:57.308
Abbington's out,
so we're short in Radiology.

32:57.392 --> 32:58.851
Why don't you have a seat?

32:59.936 --> 33:01.980
They're already riding my ass.
You know that.

33:02.063 --> 33:04.148
Sit. Please, Chelsea.

33:04.232 --> 33:06.317
I mean,
can't we just talk about this later?

33:08.027 --> 33:09.320
There is no later.

33:11.072 --> 33:12.365
We're letting you go.

33:15.493 --> 33:16.369
For what?

33:18.371 --> 33:19.831
'Cause I didn't take those sick days?

33:19.914 --> 33:23.084
-It has nothing to do with that.
-This has to do with my brother.

33:23.167 --> 33:25.169
-No, it does not.
-Bullshit.

33:25.753 --> 33:28.339
Percocet was found missing from inventory.

33:28.840 --> 33:32.593
When security reviewed the video,
they saw that you stole them.

33:32.677 --> 33:34.929
It was only once, I swear.

33:37.890 --> 33:39.017
It was just one time.

33:40.059 --> 33:42.520
-Isn't there anything you can do?
-I'm sorry.

33:43.479 --> 33:46.149
I did speak for you. I told them
you've been going through a lot.

33:46.232 --> 33:48.067
Yeah, they fucking know that.

33:48.651 --> 33:49.902
[sighs]

33:51.654 --> 33:54.198
Jackson Memorial's gonna call
for a reference. Do you have to tell them?

33:54.782 --> 33:56.117
I had no choice.

33:57.910 --> 33:58.953
Fuck me.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.671
[thudding]

34:10.048 --> 34:11.007
Meg?

34:13.634 --> 34:14.469
Meggie?

34:17.055 --> 34:18.389
Is that you, honey?

34:20.850 --> 34:23.936
-Is that you?
-[woman] Do you have any gin?

34:27.273 --> 34:28.483
This is Meg's house.

34:29.358 --> 34:30.985
She only drinks tequila.

34:32.904 --> 34:36.074
She doesn't have room
for more than one bottle in this place?

34:37.575 --> 34:41.120
Oh, you look so tired, Mama.

34:45.041 --> 34:46.042
Come on.

34:51.172 --> 34:54.675
I raised you better than to say that
to a woman over the age of 20.

35:00.389 --> 35:02.683
The day your daddy went away,
do you remember?

35:03.684 --> 35:06.187
-You-- You sat with me.
-Yeah.

35:07.021 --> 35:08.106
You were shaking.

35:08.689 --> 35:10.775
Yeah. I couldn't stop.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.654
Such a disgrace.

35:16.572 --> 35:17.615
I felt...

35:19.075 --> 35:20.660
the wolves were coming again.

35:21.494 --> 35:23.996
They were hiding behind the bushes.
But I knew they were there.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.916
Shh. Hon, don't do this.

35:27.875 --> 35:28.876
I could smell them.

35:30.461 --> 35:33.798
That wet fur. It turns my stomach.

35:34.423 --> 35:35.633
I'm sorry.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.136
I couldn't stay, Mama.

35:39.387 --> 35:41.430
I had to be with Robert.

35:44.725 --> 35:46.144
They want me to testify.

35:48.563 --> 35:49.564
I know.

35:50.690 --> 35:51.732
What do I do?

35:53.776 --> 35:56.154
You got your own children to look out for.

36:15.214 --> 36:16.048
John?

36:22.763 --> 36:24.515
[phone ringing]

36:29.812 --> 36:32.106
-Hey. What's up?
-[Lauren] Is your friend okay?

36:32.440 --> 36:33.441
Uh... Who?

36:33.524 --> 36:36.110
I was hiking up the hill.
I saw him sitting in his car.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.905
I think he might have been crying.

36:38.988 --> 36:41.532
-When was that?
-I passed him on the way up.

36:41.616 --> 36:43.201
On the way down, he was still there.

36:43.284 --> 36:45.995
I left my phone in the car,
so I couldn't call sooner.

36:46.078 --> 36:46.996
Where?

37:07.225 --> 37:09.268
Hey. What's up?

37:09.769 --> 37:11.270
LC said she saw you.

37:20.196 --> 37:21.280
You okay?

37:21.989 --> 37:23.449
I was on my way to the airport.

37:25.117 --> 37:27.161
You were gonna leave
without saying goodbye?

37:29.080 --> 37:30.373
I thought it'd be easier.

37:31.165 --> 37:32.166
[sniffles]

37:35.419 --> 37:36.504
[exhales]

37:38.130 --> 37:40.758
Jesus Christ, you really get up
this early every morning?

37:41.300 --> 37:44.512
Yeah. Yeah, unfortunately.

37:47.848 --> 37:49.058
I have nightmares.

37:50.726 --> 37:53.521
Well, one nightmare.
The same one, since we were kids.

37:55.690 --> 37:58.401
There's someone that's coming
down the driveway at the inn.

37:58.484 --> 38:01.779
And they're trying to break into
the house, and I can't lock the doors.

38:02.321 --> 38:05.324
They won't lock. I mean,
the locks are there, but I--

38:06.951 --> 38:08.244
They won't work.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.456
And then I wake up
right before I see who the person is.

38:15.876 --> 38:17.920
[sighs]

38:18.004 --> 38:19.922
I don't know. I probably sound crazy.

38:22.633 --> 38:24.302
I don't think you're crazy.

38:29.682 --> 38:30.766
Kevin--

38:33.436 --> 38:36.105
Kevin's told me
he's had a dream very similar to that.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.316
Heh.

38:43.863 --> 38:44.905
What about you?

38:50.661 --> 38:53.080
-What about me?
-You ever have it?

39:02.006 --> 39:03.341
What are you gonna do?

39:13.017 --> 39:14.977
Would it really help if I came home?

39:19.648 --> 39:21.025
It probably would.

39:23.402 --> 39:24.779
What do you want me to do?

39:37.458 --> 39:38.876
[tropical music playing over speakers]

39:38.959 --> 39:41.170
Have you ever felt
like you knew something...

39:42.004 --> 39:43.297
deep down inside...

39:46.634 --> 39:50.096
but if you actually said it out loud,
people would think you were crazy?

39:57.061 --> 39:59.397
Where was John
the night Marco was killed?

40:04.110 --> 40:05.152
I don't know.

40:06.320 --> 40:07.530
What do you mean?

40:09.615 --> 40:10.533
We'd, um...

40:11.409 --> 40:15.162
We'd had a bad fight,
and he'd gone to stay somewhere else.

40:18.833 --> 40:22.169
-Did you try to call him?
-Yeah. I did.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.255
I called, and he didn't pick up.

40:25.297 --> 40:29.760
I know that he went for a drive because
his truck broke down somewhere north.

40:31.387 --> 40:32.763
Did he return your calls?

40:34.390 --> 40:35.391
No.

40:36.809 --> 40:37.768
We were in a--

40:40.646 --> 40:42.398
We were having serious problems.

40:43.649 --> 40:45.234
Something's wrong with all of this.

40:49.071 --> 40:53.200
I think... they're all lying, Diana.

40:57.455 --> 40:58.456
Kevin.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.167
John, even Sally.

41:02.793 --> 41:04.003
All of them.

41:10.092 --> 41:11.844
-Here you are.
-Thanks.

41:16.182 --> 41:19.310
Will you stop? There's nothing out there.

41:22.688 --> 41:24.565
There are no wolves here.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.111
It's nothing. It's the wind.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.822
There's a wasp nest under the porch.

41:33.240 --> 41:34.283
Where is she?

41:35.826 --> 41:37.077
Did you find Meg?

41:40.956 --> 41:42.458
Don't lie to me, John.

41:43.542 --> 41:45.044
'Cause I can see it in your face.

41:46.086 --> 41:48.005
Did you tell her what's going on here?

41:48.088 --> 41:52.635
She asked me
what I wanted her to do, and I told her.

41:55.679 --> 41:59.308
And she was supposed to meet me
at the airport, and she didn't show up.

41:59.391 --> 42:01.769
Well, I want to talk to her.

42:02.811 --> 42:05.022
She's disconnected her phone. She's--

42:12.321 --> 42:13.614
She's not coming home.

42:16.158 --> 42:20.412
That lawyer, she said some terrible things
about us when Kevin was on the stand.

42:22.081 --> 42:23.207
I'm so sorry.

42:25.376 --> 42:26.877
They want me to testify.

42:27.670 --> 42:29.588
-No. You don't have to do that.
-I know.

42:29.672 --> 42:31.131
I have to talk to Marx.
You don't have to.

42:31.215 --> 42:32.132
No.

42:32.841 --> 42:33.842
It's time.

42:36.595 --> 42:38.305
It's time to clear the air.

42:39.890 --> 42:40.933
Clear the--?

42:41.892 --> 42:42.893
What does that mean?

42:43.477 --> 42:44.520
[Sally] It's time.

42:56.824 --> 42:59.243
We really appreciate you
coming in, Mrs. Rayburn.

43:00.077 --> 43:01.662
Sally. Please.

43:02.204 --> 43:03.539
Sally. Thank you.

43:04.373 --> 43:08.002
It must have been painful for you to hear
these charges against your family.

43:08.836 --> 43:10.671
Yes. It was.

43:11.213 --> 43:14.300
But I gather there's a few things
you'd like to clear up for us.

43:14.383 --> 43:15.551
Yes.

43:16.760 --> 43:19.513
The defense counsel made reference
to a day that happened

43:19.597 --> 43:20.973
some 30 years ago.

43:22.349 --> 43:25.644
-Do you remember that day?
-I do.

43:28.272 --> 43:31.734
Can you please tell us
what happened that day?

43:34.486 --> 43:37.865
My daughter, Sarah, drowned.

43:38.240 --> 43:41.285
I'm sorry. That's a tragedy.

43:41.744 --> 43:43.787
Is there something else
you'd like to share?

43:46.040 --> 43:50.419
I had decided... to leave my husband.

43:53.088 --> 43:55.424
We had a terrible fight.

43:57.551 --> 43:59.720
Danny took Sarah
out on the boat just to...

44:01.180 --> 44:02.931
get her away from all the yelling.

44:06.143 --> 44:08.437
I was gonna go to my mother's, then, uh--

44:09.271 --> 44:10.689
Then send for the kids.

44:11.649 --> 44:14.234
-But you never got there, did you?
-No.

44:17.112 --> 44:20.366
They stopped the bus
and told me about my daughter.

44:23.494 --> 44:26.747
And by the time I got back home,
Danny was in the hospital.

44:27.748 --> 44:28.957
And Danny is your son.

44:30.584 --> 44:32.711
He was my son.

44:33.712 --> 44:36.048
And he was in a car accident, wasn't he?

44:37.216 --> 44:38.884
And he was badly injured.

44:42.179 --> 44:43.305
No.

44:45.265 --> 44:47.685
He was beaten by my husband.

44:47.768 --> 44:50.229
[indistinct murmuring]

44:53.816 --> 44:55.359
Ms. Rayburn, are you sure?

44:55.442 --> 44:58.570
Because we heard testimony earlier.

44:59.238 --> 45:00.280
I'm sure.

45:01.615 --> 45:06.412
-Your Honor, I'd like a recess.
-No, no. I'd like to finish. Please.

45:06.495 --> 45:08.956
She's your witness, counselor.

45:09.039 --> 45:10.624
Please continue, Mrs. Rayburn.

45:12.376 --> 45:13.502
His, uh--

45:14.253 --> 45:17.172
Danny's shoulder clicked...

45:19.633 --> 45:21.093
whenever he moved it after--

45:21.969 --> 45:22.970
After that.

45:26.056 --> 45:28.183
And I'd hear the click and I'd think:

45:29.977 --> 45:31.770
"Well, that didn't heal right."

45:31.854 --> 45:35.607
Well, the police report we have
indicates otherwise.

45:36.525 --> 45:38.277
I know it does.

45:40.487 --> 45:41.989
I also know...

45:43.615 --> 45:47.870
what it was like
to have a father go to jail.

45:50.956 --> 45:54.168
The shame of it, and I--

45:55.586 --> 45:57.838
I just thought about the night
the police came...

45:58.964 --> 46:00.048
for my father.

46:02.009 --> 46:06.221
The whole town was on the street

46:06.305 --> 46:08.974
watching my mother cry.

46:12.144 --> 46:14.146
Never thought she'd stop crying.

46:14.229 --> 46:16.190
[speaking indistinctly]

46:20.861 --> 46:24.323
I didn't want my children
to have to live through that.

46:25.991 --> 46:29.077
So, I told them to lie.

46:32.164 --> 46:33.207
And they did.

46:38.128 --> 46:40.589
Your Honor, please, a recess.

46:40.672 --> 46:41.673
The day...

46:43.258 --> 46:44.092
Sarah died...

46:46.720 --> 46:50.474
I chose my husband over my son.

46:53.227 --> 46:54.686
It crushed Danny.

46:56.355 --> 46:58.273
[whimpering]
He was never the same after that.

46:59.983 --> 47:02.736
It was like-- It was like in the Bible.

47:04.238 --> 47:06.365
Abraham and Isaac.

47:10.911 --> 47:14.498
But God sent an angel to save Isaac.

47:17.543 --> 47:19.169
Danny wasn't so lucky.

47:21.004 --> 47:22.214
No angels for him.

47:29.304 --> 47:30.681
I hope you never...

47:32.224 --> 47:34.351
[sobbing]
have to ever make a choice like that.

47:40.732 --> 47:42.025
On the same day,

47:42.859 --> 47:46.697
I lost my daughter
and I also lost my son.

47:46.780 --> 47:47.781
[sobbing]

48:04.256 --> 48:06.091
No further questions, Your Honor.

48:13.181 --> 48:16.184
Mrs. Rayburn,
would you like to take a break?

48:16.268 --> 48:17.644
I'd like to continue.

48:19.521 --> 48:20.981
Your witness, counsel.

48:21.815 --> 48:23.066
[sniffles]

48:26.570 --> 48:29.615
Thank you for your candor, Mrs. Rayburn.

48:30.532 --> 48:34.161
Hard truths are painful.
This can't be easy for you.

48:35.746 --> 48:36.747
No.

48:37.956 --> 48:41.001
I'd like to direct your attention
towards your daughter, Meg.

48:41.418 --> 48:43.462
Do you know where she is currently?

48:44.755 --> 48:45.631
No.

48:46.340 --> 48:49.843
Do you think it strange
that she left so soon

48:49.926 --> 48:52.179
after Marco Diaz was murdered?

48:53.430 --> 48:57.059
And she hasn't e-mailed you
or called you?

49:00.103 --> 49:01.938
I didn't say she never called me.

49:03.273 --> 49:04.775
You've heard from her?

49:06.902 --> 49:07.903
Yes.

49:10.197 --> 49:12.949
I thought you said
you didn't know where she was.

49:13.909 --> 49:14.993
I don't.

49:18.914 --> 49:23.919
You admitted
that you told your children to lie.

49:24.920 --> 49:26.213
Just that one time.

49:26.797 --> 49:28.507
Does that include John?

49:32.386 --> 49:35.389
-Yes.
-And did that include Kevin?

49:36.348 --> 49:37.557
Yes.

49:37.974 --> 49:40.102
So, given this history of lying,

49:40.686 --> 49:44.022
do you think it's possible
that Kevin is lying now

49:44.106 --> 49:48.860
when he says he saw
my client murder Marco Diaz?

49:51.822 --> 49:54.324
-I don't know.
-Do you think it's possible

49:54.408 --> 49:58.370
that he's lying when he says
that my client shot him?

50:01.248 --> 50:02.165
I don't know.

50:05.085 --> 50:08.296
Do you think it's possible
that your daughter, Meg,

50:08.380 --> 50:12.426
murdered Marco Diaz in a jealous fit?

50:12.509 --> 50:15.262
And then called Kevin to help her?

50:16.179 --> 50:21.309
And then shot Kevin
to frame an innocent man?

50:22.185 --> 50:25.313
And then they had John cover it all up.

50:26.982 --> 50:28.191
Is that possible?

50:29.818 --> 50:31.403
Is that possible,

50:31.486 --> 50:35.490
based on your family's history of lying

50:35.907 --> 50:37.284
to protect the family?

50:38.702 --> 50:42.581
Do you think that all three of them
are lying now? Is that possible?

50:43.373 --> 50:44.416
No.

50:45.751 --> 50:47.169
No? Why?

50:49.045 --> 50:49.921
No.

50:50.756 --> 50:51.923
It's not possible.

50:53.967 --> 50:57.888
Meg could not have killed Marco Diaz.

50:59.890 --> 51:03.685
Not unless she was able to be
in two places at the same time.

51:03.769 --> 51:05.395
What does that mean?

51:05.979 --> 51:07.063
Meg was with me.

51:09.316 --> 51:13.278
Meg was with you on the night
that Marco Diaz was murdered?

51:13.361 --> 51:15.822
-Yes.
-The whole night?

51:16.573 --> 51:17.908
From 11 on.

51:18.867 --> 51:20.327
She was asleep by midnight.

51:23.538 --> 51:26.833
-Why didn't you mention this to anybody?
-Nobody asked me.

51:27.417 --> 51:30.378
Mrs. Rayburn, I'm sorry.

51:30.837 --> 51:32.881
Please help me to understand.

51:34.299 --> 51:38.303
You had this information
and you never came forward?

51:38.386 --> 51:39.846
My daughter...

51:41.264 --> 51:42.724
is not on trial

51:43.391 --> 51:48.396
for murdering Marco Diaz, Ms. Santos.

51:49.189 --> 51:50.565
Your client is.

52:08.083 --> 52:09.709
Fuck you.

52:11.044 --> 52:12.712
Fuck you all.

52:40.782 --> 52:42.784
[engine stops]

52:45.370 --> 52:46.371
Mom.

52:48.164 --> 52:49.374
Hmm?

52:49.916 --> 52:52.294
I know what you've done for all of us.

52:54.671 --> 52:55.714
Thank you.

52:56.923 --> 53:00.260
You can't do this. You can't plead guilty.

53:01.177 --> 53:03.638
You should have seen
how they fucking looked at her.

53:05.932 --> 53:10.562
It's like she was the Virgin fucking Mary
up there weeping.

53:11.438 --> 53:13.356
It doesn't mean anything.
She's a mom crying.

53:13.440 --> 53:15.400
They're gonna feel bad for a minute and--

53:15.483 --> 53:16.693
[Chelsea sighs]

53:16.776 --> 53:18.528
Doesn't mean
they're gonna find you guilty.

53:18.612 --> 53:23.408
It's not just a mom,
it's Sally Fucking Rayburn. You get it?

53:25.744 --> 53:28.121
[sighing] Fuck. Thirty years.

53:30.206 --> 53:31.917
Thirty fucking years.

53:32.959 --> 53:37.339
-It's that or the death penalty.
-This is crazy. Can you talk to him?

53:38.673 --> 53:41.843
You haven't even put up his case.
You haven't called me to the stand.

53:41.927 --> 53:44.596
I can't call you
as a witness anymore, Chelsea.

53:44.679 --> 53:47.265
I don't want you
to fucking call her as a witness.

53:47.724 --> 53:49.184
Marx will just chew you alive.

53:49.267 --> 53:53.271
The circumstances of your firing
completely discredit your testimony.

53:53.897 --> 53:55.815
-What?
-It's useless now.

53:57.817 --> 53:59.611
I didn't steal anything.
They're making it up.

54:00.612 --> 54:03.031
-They have you on camera.
-It was one pill, one time.

54:03.114 --> 54:04.407
Doesn't matter, Chelsea.

54:04.491 --> 54:07.535
So, that's it? You just give up?
He just goes away for 30 years?

54:07.994 --> 54:09.663
It's not really my decision.

54:09.746 --> 54:12.749
And even if we plead guilty,
they may not accept it.

54:12.832 --> 54:14.292
You told me you believed in him.

54:15.085 --> 54:15.919
I do.

54:17.796 --> 54:20.715
But what happened today,
Sally Rayburn hurt us.

54:20.799 --> 54:21.800
[Eric] I'm done.

54:23.385 --> 54:24.636
I don't wanna die.

54:32.519 --> 54:33.603
So, you'll talk to them?

54:48.410 --> 54:50.078
Diana told me the story

54:51.413 --> 54:54.374
that you told about your father and--

54:57.627 --> 54:58.545
Jesus, I--

54:59.713 --> 55:01.172
I can't imagine what--

55:02.007 --> 55:03.842
What you went through. I'm so sorry.

55:08.388 --> 55:11.766
I just... thought maybe it'd help.

55:27.282 --> 55:28.283
It wasn't true.

55:30.326 --> 55:31.578
Of course not.

55:32.871 --> 55:35.248
Don't you think
I would've told you that by now?

55:36.624 --> 55:37.834
And just so we're clear,

55:38.460 --> 55:41.129
I didn't do it for you or for Kevin.

55:43.173 --> 55:44.340
I did it for Meg.

56:08.907 --> 56:11.618
Well, like I said,
I'm sorry y'all had to go through this.

56:12.577 --> 56:14.079
I wish your family the best.

56:15.205 --> 56:18.166
Move on with your lives,
put this shit in your rear-view mirror.

56:18.249 --> 56:20.543
Listen, um, I wanna say...

56:23.421 --> 56:26.466
thank you for everything you've done.

56:27.634 --> 56:29.260
A new day begins, right, Kevin?

56:31.596 --> 56:32.639
Good night, man.

56:41.064 --> 56:42.023
[sighs]

56:45.652 --> 56:46.486
[laughs]

56:56.621 --> 56:57.997
[sighs]

57:00.375 --> 57:02.418
[Roy] Well, that was quite a performance.

57:02.502 --> 57:04.170
The jury wept.

57:05.004 --> 57:08.591
-I almost shed a tear myself.
-I did what I had to do.

57:08.883 --> 57:09.968
[Roy] Mm.

57:10.343 --> 57:12.178
You always do, Sally.

57:12.762 --> 57:14.681
That's what I admire about you.

57:15.723 --> 57:17.642
For all that sweetness,

57:18.268 --> 57:20.687
you're about as cold-blooded
as they come.

57:22.772 --> 57:24.774
Is that your idea of a compliment?

57:28.069 --> 57:30.780
-Your kids know you're here?
-No.

57:32.657 --> 57:35.952
-I don't want them involved.
-They are involved.

57:36.035 --> 57:38.538
I'll tell them when it's appropriate.

57:39.372 --> 57:41.416
I think you might regret it, Sally.

57:41.499 --> 57:45.211
This is not something
