WEBVTT

00:00.679 --> 00:02.317
Look at me, right?

00:02.319 --> 00:04.077
And look at the Queen.

00:04.078 --> 00:07.359
I was never a fan
until it occurred to me how much

00:07.398 --> 00:09.218
me and Ma'am have in common.

00:09.291 --> 00:12.089
Bringing up kiddies you can't
remember the names of.

00:12.091 --> 00:15.369
I know she's not a single parent
but she might as well be.

00:15.371 --> 00:19.049
Plus, the pair of us,
we've stuck to our guns,

00:19.051 --> 00:22.249
her literally sometimes,
and flagshipped a dying breed.

00:22.251 --> 00:24.649
Admired and despised, equally.

00:24.651 --> 00:27.169
Not for never lifting
a finger. No...

00:27.171 --> 00:29.889
for setting examples
through extremity.

00:29.891 --> 00:32.729
And whether you're a bigwig on her
end or a bigwig on mine,

00:32.731 --> 00:35.649
you've still got your dickheads
in the middle to deal with,

00:35.651 --> 00:37.609
snip, snip, snipping
at your benefits.

00:37.611 --> 00:40.129
I mean, she can't not be
looking at me and thinking,

00:40.131 --> 00:42.129
"What's your secret, Frank?"

00:42.131 --> 00:44.369
I got shot of my kids yonks back.

00:44.371 --> 00:46.929
Whereas she's yet to see
the back of a single one.

00:46.931 --> 00:49.929
Fine! I've had to get out of bed on
occasion to make ends meet,

00:49.931 --> 00:53.931
whereas she... she's done the whole
thing from a chair.

00:54.851 --> 00:56.849
Oh, and a drink for the lady.

00:56.851 --> 00:59.369
Oh, sure, there's perks. But, look
at her lot.

00:59.371 --> 01:02.129
Brian May prancing
about on her roof.

01:02.131 --> 01:08.041
Now, look at my lot... we know how to
throw a proper fucking paaaarty!

01:08.043 --> 01:12.183

01:12.295 --> 01:16.295
I remember Liverpool in
the '70s, industry menopause.

01:16.652 --> 01:20.652
Shipyards closed,
car plants relocated,

01:20.989 --> 01:24.267
last orders for the Scouse nation.

01:24.269 --> 01:27.667
But did we lie down and die?
Did we fuck?!

01:27.669 --> 01:31.669
We embraced change and expanded
our horizons.

01:32.109 --> 01:34.907
Ended up European City of Culture.

01:34.909 --> 01:38.907
That left behind a proper legacy.

01:38.909 --> 01:42.387
So, moral of the tale... when the
menopause kicks in,

01:42.389 --> 01:43.987
what are you going to do?

01:43.989 --> 01:47.989
Lie back and wither? Or rise like
a Liver Bird Phoenix?

01:49.549 --> 01:51.627
Why won't you tell us
where we're going?

01:51.629 --> 01:55.267
Almost there.

01:55.269 --> 01:57.507
No way! Is that Rooney in
that Porsche?

01:57.509 --> 01:58.787
Probably was.

01:58.789 --> 01:59.907
Mr and Mrs Tutton?

01:59.909 --> 02:01.267
Yeah.

02:01.269 --> 02:03.467
Never forget where you've come from,

02:03.469 --> 02:05.947
or the people that got you
there along the way.

02:05.949 --> 02:09.949
Because how they remember you is
the real legacy you leave behind.

02:10.068 --> 02:11.747
It's even smaller than ours.

02:11.749 --> 02:13.547
So? There's only three of us.

02:13.549 --> 02:15.027
For all that money, though?

02:15.029 --> 02:16.707
Location, location, location.

02:16.709 --> 02:19.227
D'you think Kirsty would look
twice at Chatsworth?

02:19.229 --> 02:23.229
Who'd look at that fat parcel?

02:23.629 --> 02:27.587
Oh, be able to squeeze
a little bar in here.

02:27.589 --> 02:29.427
You've got a lovely home.

02:29.429 --> 02:31.867
Thank you. I've been very
happy here.

02:31.869 --> 02:33.667
As I'm sure you would be.

02:33.669 --> 02:34.947
What's outside?

02:34.949 --> 02:38.387
Be my guest. The courtyard's
a delightful suntrap.

02:38.389 --> 02:40.787
Forgive me not showing you
round myself.

02:40.789 --> 02:43.787
As usual, I'm up
to my neck in charity work.

02:43.789 --> 02:46.467
Muggins at home organising
this year's ball.

02:46.469 --> 02:47.907
Sounds impressive.

02:47.909 --> 02:51.909
Secretary for 12 years and never
known such a struggle raising funds.

02:53.229 --> 02:55.987
Harsh times means less charity.

02:55.989 --> 02:58.467
And now when you need it more
than ever.

02:58.469 --> 03:01.547
Indeed.

03:01.549 --> 03:05.549
St Bart's Year 10 rugby tour
to Argentina...

03:07.509 --> 03:09.227
Oh, I've got no change, sorry.

03:09.229 --> 03:13.229
Oh! That'll be fine, thank you.

03:27.709 --> 03:28.987
What time is it?

03:28.989 --> 03:32.587
10 o'clock, sleepyhead. No rush.

03:32.589 --> 03:34.947
You only left an hour ago.

03:34.949 --> 03:38.907
Fancied a cuddle.

03:38.909 --> 03:42.909
It's all right, isn't it?

03:44.549 --> 03:48.549
Eugh!

03:53.269 --> 03:54.427
What's wrong?

03:54.429 --> 03:56.547
Nothing's wrong.

03:56.549 --> 04:00.549
Got to do a bit of graft now
and again, haven't I?

04:05.149 --> 04:07.107
When you know, you know.

04:07.109 --> 04:10.427
Exactly. It's sending me under,
she's so clingy.

04:10.429 --> 04:12.507
Every call-out this side of town,

04:12.509 --> 04:14.667
so she can sneak a little
fucking tamper.

04:14.669 --> 04:16.507
Put her out of her misery.

04:16.509 --> 04:18.587
It's finding the right moment, innit?

04:18.589 --> 04:21.387
Well, the longer you leave it,
the harder it gets.

04:21.389 --> 04:24.827
Another drink might help.

04:24.829 --> 04:28.829
Did 'em cheap, that's the last 5,000
of Dessie's dodgy e's.

04:28.869 --> 04:32.387
Remind me not to buy even
a paracetamol off that gimp.

04:32.389 --> 04:35.827
If it's over, no talk about
taking a break, dragging it out,

04:35.829 --> 04:37.307
make it clean and quick.

04:37.309 --> 04:40.867
I'm doing it, I'm doing it.

04:40.869 --> 04:43.507
She's going on about a rugby
trip to South America,

04:43.509 --> 04:47.067
and St Marcy's haven't even
got a gym!

04:47.069 --> 04:49.267
Is it hot in here or is it just me?

04:49.269 --> 04:51.267
You OK?

04:51.269 --> 04:52.787
That could be my legacy.

04:52.789 --> 04:54.307
'Legacy'?

04:54.309 --> 04:56.267
Oh, you've not had bad
news have you?

04:56.269 --> 04:58.947
- I could re-build the gym.
- Mimi!

04:58.949 --> 05:01.747
Oh, calm down. I'm "changing".

05:01.749 --> 05:05.547
Changing? In what way?

05:05.549 --> 05:08.827
Oh, you don't want to be
a man, do you?!

05:08.829 --> 05:10.987
It's a woman-only issue.

05:10.989 --> 05:14.907
Menopause... early. But that
doesn't matter.

05:14.909 --> 05:18.909
I'm taking control of my life,
making a difference to others.

05:19.909 --> 05:23.909
Watch me roar.

05:37.229 --> 05:39.827
Listen, er, we need to talk.

05:39.829 --> 05:41.947
It's bad manners when your
mouth's full.

05:45.869 --> 05:49.227
Dessert is going to blow your mind.

05:53.149 --> 05:56.227
Wilmslow's a bit far, though,
remember that wine bar?

05:56.229 --> 05:59.387
Oh, yeah, full of divorcee losers
trying too hard.

05:59.389 --> 06:02.507
I think it's mint. Full of readies,

06:02.509 --> 06:04.267
fourbies, Bentleys, Ferraris...

06:04.269 --> 06:06.547
Yeah, driven by Wags
who'd struggle with a Clio.

06:06.549 --> 06:07.827
Oh, here he is... at it again.

06:07.829 --> 06:09.907
Watch your bags, ladies,
tea-leaf in the area.

06:09.909 --> 06:12.467
Serves him right, the fat fuck,
shouldn't leave his van open

06:12.469 --> 06:14.667
while he goes off for a burger.

06:14.669 --> 06:15.987
What are they?

06:15.989 --> 06:17.747
Trackers. It's like James Bond,
innit?

06:17.749 --> 06:20.429
Should use one on her in case she's
out noshing someone else.

06:36.709 --> 06:38.507
Marry me?

06:38.509 --> 06:39.427
What?

06:39.429 --> 06:40.347
Marry me!

06:40.349 --> 06:41.467
I can't.

06:41.469 --> 06:42.947
Of course you can.

06:42.949 --> 06:44.667
It doesn't have to be
a fancy...

06:44.669 --> 06:47.667
I don't want to be with you any more.

06:47.669 --> 06:49.867
What do you mean?

06:49.869 --> 06:51.427
It's over.

06:51.429 --> 06:52.627
What is?

06:52.629 --> 06:53.867
Us.

06:53.869 --> 06:57.869
Why?

06:58.229 --> 07:02.229
I'm sorry.

07:03.229 --> 07:06.467
Maybe you just need a break?

07:06.469 --> 07:07.907
It'd be cruel to drag it out.

07:07.909 --> 07:11.027
You didn't have the heart to tell me
earlier because I'd gone to

07:11.029 --> 07:14.187
so much effort?

07:14.189 --> 07:17.507
Don't you like fucking me?

07:17.509 --> 07:21.509
All day. It's not enough to
sustain a relationship.

07:23.069 --> 07:25.587
Said the pages of Cosmopolitan.

07:25.589 --> 07:27.907
I still feel the same after.

07:27.909 --> 07:31.909
Patronising prick.

07:35.269 --> 07:37.787
Look, I've got some stuff to sort.

07:37.789 --> 07:41.789
It's probably best if you're
gone by the time I get back.

07:50.189 --> 07:53.627
I'd be crying off sick every week
if I had to do PE in that dump.

07:53.629 --> 07:56.107
Er, fuck the lardy little
uprights-in-need,

07:56.109 --> 07:59.027
what about an overhaul
of my janitor-shithole?

07:59.029 --> 08:02.227
I'm talking about the health
of the future generation.

08:02.229 --> 08:04.827
And I'm saying my room hasn't
had a lick of paint

08:04.829 --> 08:08.267
since Tom Brown's ring-piece was
caressed by his master's slippers.

08:08.269 --> 08:11.027
Frank, this matters! Making
a positive impact,

08:11.029 --> 08:13.787
leaving something behind that makes
a difference.

08:13.789 --> 08:17.787
Oh, moral compensation
for your other bequests?

08:17.789 --> 08:21.147
Inflicting a bunch of psychopathic
villains on society?

08:21.149 --> 08:25.149
I'll fucking inflict them on you
if you're not careful.

08:25.909 --> 08:28.707
Don't even think about it.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.229
I wasn't.

08:32.389 --> 08:34.667
St Marcy's gym was hanging
when I went there.

08:34.669 --> 08:38.669
Doesn't mean you want to rebuild
it, though.

08:40.828 --> 08:43.147
Why's Benny bringing
students back here?

08:43.149 --> 08:46.867
Possible gold mine, there's more
round Manchester than anywhere else.

08:46.869 --> 08:49.507
You'll not get a sniff that
pure in Chipping Norton.

08:49.509 --> 08:53.509
Treble up, it'll still blow your
bollocks off.

08:53.709 --> 08:54.907
Bonus.

08:54.909 --> 08:55.827
Appreciated.

08:55.829 --> 08:57.787
You collecting off Coggsy tomorrow?

08:57.789 --> 08:59.427
Big Mark's two weeks behind.

08:59.429 --> 09:00.947
Take care of both, yeah?

09:00.949 --> 09:02.909
With pleasure.

09:05.749 --> 09:06.987
Who scored?

09:06.989 --> 09:10.747
Short-arse, thatch-weave, dumpy
little fucking Mickey Mouser.

09:10.749 --> 09:12.587
Oi! Rooney's my hero.

09:12.589 --> 09:15.707
He'll be paying you 40 quid to
hang out of you next week.

09:15.709 --> 09:19.709
He popped in once, but I was
a little bit too young for him.

09:19.829 --> 09:23.829
None of you twats got a watch?

09:26.789 --> 09:28.307
If a legacy matters so much,

09:28.309 --> 09:30.707
what's wrong with
a bench in Poundswick Park?

09:30.709 --> 09:34.067
Cos all the little scrotes will tag
it and burn it on Bonfire Night.

09:34.069 --> 09:36.107
I think a new gym's a great idea.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.147
It's paying for it
I'm struggling with!

09:38.149 --> 09:41.787
All I'm suggesting is a donation
of a poxy grand each!

09:41.789 --> 09:45.789
To get the ball rolling.
I'll raise the rest of the funds.

09:47.509 --> 09:48.627
I'll chip in.

09:48.629 --> 09:50.507
Yep, we will too.

09:50.509 --> 09:53.147
The kiddies'll appreciate that.

09:53.149 --> 09:56.547
Come on, then, Cilla, Connor, let's
go and get your favourite DVD on.

09:56.549 --> 09:57.427
What are you doing?

09:57.429 --> 09:59.147
What's your favourite?

09:59.149 --> 10:01.827
You'd better brace yourself.
My mam started in her 40s,

10:01.829 --> 10:03.867
went agoraphobic then ran away
to sea.

10:03.869 --> 10:07.027
I've checked it out. Most women
calm down when the drugs kick in.

10:07.029 --> 10:08.747
So this is all bollocks, then?

10:08.749 --> 10:11.987
It's going to be sweet, mate. This
gym thing is just a passing phase.

10:11.989 --> 10:13.627
Your grand's going nowhere.

10:13.629 --> 10:15.067
So, how was Wilmslow?

10:15.069 --> 10:17.227
Half a million for a bedsit
above a chippy?

10:17.229 --> 10:19.547
Who'd want to live in a stuck-up,
two-faced,

10:19.549 --> 10:21.987
wannabe shithole like that anyway?

10:21.989 --> 10:24.867
Cos I want a smile off a neighbour
who's not afraid of me.

10:24.869 --> 10:27.827
I want to talk to an old man about
the weather instead of him

10:27.829 --> 10:30.747
scurrying past to get his snout
and his ale.

10:30.749 --> 10:32.587
They smoke and drink there too, Mam.

10:32.589 --> 10:35.547
Yeah, only menthol cigs
and vintage champagne, though, eh?

10:35.549 --> 10:39.067
Their shit don't smell either... and
it's too far for business.

10:39.069 --> 10:41.907
There's another reason
I've asked you for dinner.

10:41.909 --> 10:45.909
Leaving a family in harmony is
as important as any physical legacy.

10:46.989 --> 10:49.227
You two have drifted apart.

10:49.229 --> 10:53.229
There's a way of working together,
appreciating each other more.

10:54.869 --> 10:56.463
I'm retiring.

11:08.584 --> 11:12.884
These hands are to commemorate
the toil endured to create

11:12.969 --> 11:16.489
the Mimi Tutton Academy
of Sports Science.

11:37.289 --> 11:39.087
Couple of quid
Frank, St Marcy's gym?

11:39.089 --> 11:40.567
Not while you look like a cunt.

11:40.569 --> 11:43.087
There's nobody less likely
to donate.

11:43.089 --> 11:45.729
What's fancy dress actually
about, eh? "Nice one, cowboy,

11:45.746 --> 11:47.904
"nice one, spaceman."

11:47.906 --> 11:51.906
Some straight-going shithouse's
40th in the labour club.

11:52.026 --> 11:53.664
Then what for the rest
of the night?!

11:53.666 --> 11:55.626
You're going to have any
kind of conversation with

11:55.697 --> 11:57.457
a knobhead in a pirate hat?

11:57.498 --> 11:58.656
That's a no, then?

11:58.658 --> 12:01.898
Put me down for a pound
when I can look at you.

12:02.006 --> 12:04.644
Contacts, deals,
business already in place,

12:04.646 --> 12:06.724
and we get to keep all
the earnings.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.804
Who'd have thought Mimi could be
so generous?

12:08.806 --> 12:12.044
It's an opportunity to take things
in the directions we've always
wanted to.

12:12.046 --> 12:15.404
Or... we're now subsidising that
scrawny baghead on our own.

12:15.406 --> 12:16.964
He might step up?

12:16.966 --> 12:19.124
First day of the rest
of our lives, eh?

12:19.126 --> 12:21.324
Equal partner reporting for duty.

12:21.326 --> 12:24.084
It'd be the first decent day's graft
you've done in a while.

12:24.086 --> 12:26.484
How's St Mimi's gymnasium
coming along then?

12:26.486 --> 12:29.804
How do you think?!
Making mental decisions
when she's off her head on drugs?

12:29.806 --> 12:32.524
Someone should have a quiet word
and tell her it's not worth it.

12:32.526 --> 12:36.004
What about the mental decision
to give you two the business?

12:36.006 --> 12:39.964
I take it you didn't grow a pair?
WPC Needy?

12:39.966 --> 12:41.164
I told her!

12:41.166 --> 12:44.084
Well, she's not got the message?

12:44.086 --> 12:48.086
Lesson number one, mate.
Feds outside's bad for business.

12:52.126 --> 12:55.724
Hello, stranger. Beer taste flat
cos you're missing me?

12:55.726 --> 12:56.844
What are you playing at?

12:56.846 --> 12:58.844
It feels nice to know you're nearby.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.724
People are uncomfortable.

13:00.726 --> 13:03.004
Locals feel safer
when a bobby's visible.

13:03.006 --> 13:05.364
Round here it's intimidation.

13:05.366 --> 13:08.284
Is there someone else?

13:08.286 --> 13:09.884
I wouldn't do that.

13:09.886 --> 13:11.764
At least it would make sense.

13:11.766 --> 13:15.004
Look, we're just...
We're too different.

13:15.006 --> 13:17.164
I know there's something
else going on.

13:17.166 --> 13:19.564
You're a policewoman
for fuck's sake.

13:19.566 --> 13:22.804
Family pressures can be stressful,
make you behave irrationally.

13:22.806 --> 13:26.806
Shane! You've got stuff to do.

13:28.606 --> 13:30.686
He never liked me.
Give him my love.

13:40.366 --> 13:42.364
Hiya. Have a good day!

13:42.366 --> 13:46.366
Thank you, thank you.

13:48.086 --> 13:51.364
Gives me the horrors, this place.
Bad juju, man.

13:51.366 --> 13:54.124
Improving the facilities might mean
the kiddies have a better

13:54.126 --> 13:56.044
experience than you.

13:56.046 --> 13:58.844
Chesney's doing good,
how's the Jockey?

13:58.846 --> 14:00.806
Yeah, people are mad for it.

14:04.686 --> 14:08.686
How much is that?

14:17.246 --> 14:19.324
It might not happen
as quick as we hoped.

14:19.326 --> 14:22.404
It'll take longer than building the
Great Wall of China at this rate.

14:22.406 --> 14:23.684
Nah, look after the pennies.

14:23.686 --> 14:25.804
What's the point in building
her hopes up?

14:25.806 --> 14:29.644
Seriously?! Does this mean
we can have our grand back?

14:29.646 --> 14:32.404
Where's the Chatsworth Variety Table
when you need it?

14:32.406 --> 14:35.804
Maybe I can be their after
dinner speaker, eh?

14:35.806 --> 14:38.724
Yeah, like they want to listen to
stories about shovelling shit.

14:38.726 --> 14:41.124
Well, is there a reason
we can't start one up?

14:41.126 --> 14:42.844
Have a look, will you?

14:42.846 --> 14:46.846
That lot are on the lookout
for handouts as it is.

14:50.646 --> 14:54.646
Hey! Hey, that's thingy.
Selling the house.

14:55.686 --> 14:58.564
More money for St Fart's
polo ponies?

14:58.566 --> 15:00.284
Nah, not quite, get on this!

15:00.286 --> 15:03.204
She's donated 50 grand to
a donkey sanctuary in Ardwick.

15:03.206 --> 15:07.206
It's not just Wilmslow
she does charity for.

15:08.846 --> 15:12.284
If the kiddies of Chatsworth have a
state of the art fitness centre,

15:12.286 --> 15:14.844
they'll be able to work off
all those Mars bars

15:14.846 --> 15:17.764
and chips their parents
feed them for dinner.

15:17.766 --> 15:21.084
They'll never have the opportunities
they have round here,

15:21.086 --> 15:24.884
but they should be able to play
PE like anyone else.

15:24.886 --> 15:28.886
With your help,
we can make a difference.

15:29.046 --> 15:31.484
Thank you, Mimi -

15:31.486 --> 15:34.764
a stirring presentation.

15:34.766 --> 15:38.284
Mimi's get-up-and-go enthusiasm
could well become a regular

15:38.286 --> 15:40.804
feature of our little gang.

15:40.806 --> 15:44.004
She's thinking of making
an offer on my house.

15:44.006 --> 15:46.326
Did you win the lottery?!

15:48.926 --> 15:52.926
As worthy a cause as St Marcy's
undoubtedly is, one

15:53.246 --> 15:57.246
of the biggest issues is the number
of projects already in the planning.

15:59.206 --> 16:02.044
The gym will have to wait in line.

16:02.046 --> 16:04.684
Fair enough. Until when?

16:04.686 --> 16:08.364
Concentrated focus, dinners,
auctions,

16:08.366 --> 16:12.366
none of that can be
considered before 2018.

16:13.966 --> 16:17.966
Thank you, ladies.

16:22.846 --> 16:26.724
Hot chocolate and ginger snaps.

16:26.726 --> 16:30.726
I got you some vag cream
in case it's still itchy.

16:32.166 --> 16:35.484
Jamie and Shane
think I've lost the plot.

16:35.486 --> 16:38.444
That's cos it's easier for them
to laugh than look in the mirror

16:38.446 --> 16:40.404
and admit they're selfish fucks.

16:40.406 --> 16:42.084
True...

16:42.086 --> 16:46.086
but 78 quid to go with 3 grand says
to me they've got a point.

16:48.206 --> 16:51.924
I'm not going to see that new roof
go on in my lifetime.

16:51.926 --> 16:55.044
Even if it's Cilla that's got to cut
the ribbon, you've started

16:55.046 --> 16:59.046
something mega here. The kids of
Chatsworth will owe you for ever.

17:00.206 --> 17:04.205
If we could bottle and sell your
support we'd get there in no time.

17:05.566 --> 17:08.924
I just wish there was more
I could do.

17:08.925 --> 17:12.925
I wanted to leave something
good behind.

17:25.566 --> 17:29.244
Saturday's rollover comes in,
I'll build her a whole new school.

17:29.246 --> 17:32.604
Even better - The Mimi Maguire
University Of Chatsworth.

17:32.606 --> 17:35.604
Yeah, get in with four F's
and get a caution for smoking weed?

17:35.606 --> 17:37.524
Robbing a bank's easier than
the lottery.

17:37.526 --> 17:39.404
Yeah, but it's not worth
getting caught.

17:39.406 --> 17:40.884
Jail's easy, you pussy.

17:40.886 --> 17:42.404
Mimi's backhander isn't.

17:42.406 --> 17:44.684
I'm juvenile anyway -
wouldn't have to go to jail.

17:44.686 --> 17:45.804
Are you stupid?!

17:45.806 --> 17:48.324
Look, don't get too involved with
Butch and Sundance over there.

17:48.326 --> 17:50.684
Robbing anything
like that, you're going down.

17:50.686 --> 17:54.686
Eh, Pot Noodles are in aisle two,
mate, skins behind the counter.

17:55.966 --> 17:57.484
Still got some of them trackers?

17:57.486 --> 17:58.844
Yeah, why?

17:58.846 --> 17:59.924
Stall this guy.

17:59.926 --> 18:01.164
Why?

18:01.166 --> 18:03.804
Just stall him.

18:03.806 --> 18:05.964
Eh, he's thinking of going
to uni, you know?

18:05.966 --> 18:07.244
Which one?

18:07.246 --> 18:11.246
Er... looking for ideas.

18:18.326 --> 18:19.524
Are you taking the piss?

18:19.526 --> 18:20.524
Yeah, I know.

18:20.526 --> 18:21.564
Not lying, are you?

18:21.566 --> 18:22.604
No, I'm serious.

18:22.606 --> 18:26.606
That's crazy, that.

18:31.766 --> 18:34.324
Yo, it costs 30 grand just
to go to uni, you know?

18:34.326 --> 18:37.564
Yeah? No wonder
he needs a part time job.

18:37.566 --> 18:39.124
Did you do it?

18:39.126 --> 18:43.126
Yeah, man. Sweet.

18:51.806 --> 18:55.806
Scouse Macka at two o'clock -
ten K of weed,

18:55.966 --> 18:59.966
Benchill Dave, four.
Three thousand Es...

19:01.046 --> 19:05.046
Or was it Scouse Macka at four
with three K of weed

19:05.166 --> 19:09.166
and Benchill Dave at ten
with 2,000 diddlys?!

19:09.686 --> 19:13.686
Fuck! How does anyone
remember this shit?

19:25.086 --> 19:27.564
What the fuck?!

19:27.566 --> 19:29.644
That is not funny.

19:29.646 --> 19:31.364
It was worth a try.

19:31.366 --> 19:32.484
Did you hear any of that?

19:32.486 --> 19:35.484
Like I'd say anything.

19:35.486 --> 19:39.486
That's what turned me
on in the first place.

19:40.206 --> 19:43.964
Look.
This is not helping your cause.

19:43.966 --> 19:45.524
So I have got one?

19:45.526 --> 19:49.444
No, you haven't!
Just forget about us, c'mon.

19:49.446 --> 19:52.844
When Dad retired,
handed the business to my brother,

19:52.846 --> 19:56.604
he went weird - strain
on his marriage, readjustment.

19:56.606 --> 19:57.924
But they worked it out, though.

19:57.926 --> 20:00.124
It's fuck all to do
with anything else.

20:00.126 --> 20:03.404
Pressure and denial won't let you
access the truth right now.

20:03.406 --> 20:04.684
In time...

20:04.686 --> 20:08.644
Please. Shut the fuck up. I don't
want to end up hating you, OK?

20:08.646 --> 20:11.604
That can never happen.

20:11.606 --> 20:15.606
So, go!

20:21.446 --> 20:25.446
That's definitely his car.

20:27.446 --> 20:29.204
There he is!

20:29.206 --> 20:31.244
Bingo!

20:31.246 --> 20:33.164
Jamie and Shane aren't going to be
happy about this.

20:33.166 --> 20:34.244
Fuck 'em.

20:34.246 --> 20:36.324
They earn more than ever cos
Mimi stepped down,

20:36.326 --> 20:38.084
and now they take the piss
out of her?!

20:38.086 --> 20:40.004
- What if he goes to the police?
- Oh, right, yeah!

20:40.006 --> 20:44.004
"Excuse me, Mr Policeman,
somebody stole my cocaine."

20:44.006 --> 20:45.444
Think about it, mate.

20:45.446 --> 20:46.644
He might be connected?

20:46.646 --> 20:48.564
Why are you so scared?
You're not even going in?

20:48.566 --> 20:49.724
Cos they might come out?

20:49.726 --> 20:53.726
Ches, just chill out. Focus.
Right, you ready?

20:53.926 --> 20:57.926
Let's have it.

21:18.766 --> 21:20.044
Where's the gear?!

21:20.046 --> 21:22.324
I don't know what
you're talking about.

21:22.326 --> 21:25.724
Ten, nine, eight...

21:25.726 --> 21:29.726
Behind the sofa!

21:34.646 --> 21:38.646
I've got it.

21:46.246 --> 21:50.246
Quick, get in!

21:50.286 --> 21:51.671
Go, go, go, go!

21:54.225 --> 21:56.285
You have to admit it's a
bit of a coincidence.

21:56.457 --> 21:58.695
You've had hundreds of punters go
through that door!

21:58.697 --> 21:59.935
Anyone could have set you up.

21:59.937 --> 22:01.455
On the same day I buy another batch?

22:01.457 --> 22:05.457
I've had ten years of satisfied
customers.

22:05.537 --> 22:09.537
Think I'm going to jeopardise my
reputation for a fucking half key?

22:13.777 --> 22:15.975
Wave bye-bye to that golden goose.

22:15.977 --> 22:18.535
Got some front asking for his money
back, though, eh?

22:18.537 --> 22:21.375
Exactly. What's it got to do with
you if he's been taxed?

22:21.377 --> 22:23.095
If he even has.

22:23.097 --> 22:27.097
Someone's had him over.
If not, he deserves an Oscar.

22:32.977 --> 22:34.455
What you doing?!

22:34.457 --> 22:36.615
What? Think it's
turned into a real one overnight?

22:36.617 --> 22:39.975
Bad luck to fuck about with them.

22:39.977 --> 22:42.015
Right, it's all there.
Nice one, cuz.

22:42.017 --> 22:46.017
See you later.

22:47.577 --> 22:49.055
Not bad for half an hour's work.

22:49.057 --> 22:51.375
You what?
Ten grand's a fucking joke.

22:51.377 --> 22:54.095
How else would you shift it?
No questions asked - Bradford.

22:54.097 --> 22:57.375
Where it's never going to get on top
from taxing your own family's
punters.

22:57.377 --> 23:01.377
I find out you're having
a drink behind my back...

23:03.857 --> 23:07.055
Trafford Centre for me - new Air Max
colours have just come out.

23:07.057 --> 23:09.415
Wait - I risk life
and limb for a oner?

23:09.417 --> 23:13.215
I'd have done it for nowt.

23:13.217 --> 23:14.935
Safe!

23:14.937 --> 23:18.937
The rest is for Mimi.
For the kiddies.

23:30.777 --> 23:33.815
Just picked this up from the golf
club in Wilmslow.

23:33.817 --> 23:37.415
If we're lucky there'll be enough to
get another bag of cement.

23:37.417 --> 23:40.975
At last! £1.75

23:40.977 --> 23:43.735
to go with the postal order for 50p.

23:43.737 --> 23:47.737
Look - feels heavy. And you know
there's readies round there.

23:47.897 --> 23:51.897
Maybe our first pound coin.

23:55.417 --> 23:56.695
What the fuck?!

23:56.697 --> 24:00.335
No way!

24:00.337 --> 24:04.337
See.

24:10.177 --> 24:11.735
What are you doing here?

24:11.737 --> 24:13.495
Meeting Scouse Macka.

24:13.497 --> 24:14.695
In the Jockey?!

24:14.697 --> 24:18.295
Two o'clock. Might be stuck in
traffic, I'll give him a bell now.

24:18.297 --> 24:21.815
Wythenshawe Daz comes here,
Scouse Macka's Lymm Services.

24:21.817 --> 24:25.615
What's that?

24:25.617 --> 24:28.215
Up here. Names, dates, figures.

24:28.217 --> 24:31.535
Numptys and dumb cunts who write
things down go to jail!

24:31.537 --> 24:32.935
We can't all be Rain Man, can we?

24:32.937 --> 24:35.535
Anyone could find that!

24:35.537 --> 24:39.375
Yeah, so he's going to hang around
with ten key of weed in the fucking
boot.

24:39.377 --> 24:40.135
It's gone straight to answer phone.

24:40.137 --> 24:42.855
Why wouldn't he? As far as he's
concerned you're nicked.

24:42.857 --> 24:44.775
That could be the feds
setting him up.

24:44.777 --> 24:46.215
If he's at home he'll
answer his land line.

24:46.217 --> 24:50.217
Yeah. Mam's got that number.
Up there.

24:51.377 --> 24:53.175
- Things are getting slack.
- Not now, Benny.

24:53.177 --> 24:55.135
It's easy for you to say.
I've got kids to feed.

24:55.137 --> 24:56.855
You don't like it, you know
what you can do.

24:56.857 --> 25:00.857
Oh, it's like that, is it?

25:03.617 --> 25:05.855
You'll never guess how much is here.

25:05.857 --> 25:07.655
Go on.

25:07.657 --> 25:11.215
9,600. I said it, didn't I?

25:11.217 --> 25:12.415
You did.

25:12.417 --> 25:14.415
Generous as fuck.

25:14.417 --> 25:16.455
Wait, how much?

25:16.457 --> 25:19.815
Nine six.

25:19.817 --> 25:20.575
What you doing?

25:20.577 --> 25:21.735
What?

25:21.737 --> 25:23.815
Think it's turned into
a real one overnight?

25:23.817 --> 25:27.817
What? Think it's turned into
a real one overnight?

25:28.697 --> 25:32.697
Women of Wilmslow,
you fucking beauts.

25:36.257 --> 25:40.257
This is all very lovely, Mimi,
and we appreciate your efforts,

25:40.697 --> 25:42.895
but it won't make any difference.

25:42.897 --> 25:46.575
St Marcy's still has to
take its place in the queue.

25:46.577 --> 25:50.577
Except somebody decided St Marcy's
deserved a push to the

25:51.017 --> 25:53.575
front of that queue.

25:53.577 --> 25:56.295
Getting everyone together
is the only way

25:56.297 --> 26:00.255
we can make sure our gratitude
falls on the right ears.

26:00.257 --> 26:02.695
There's a feeling people
with money hold

26:02.697 --> 26:06.015
onto their readies like
a pit bull with a baby.

26:06.017 --> 26:09.935
But deep down we're all
the same - some cautious,

26:09.937 --> 26:13.415
some off the wall generous.

26:13.417 --> 26:17.417
That anonymous donation
of nearly £10,000

26:19.257 --> 26:21.895
is a massive boost.

26:21.897 --> 26:25.897
Money attracts money
and the momentum is truly with us.

26:26.417 --> 26:30.417
And, whoever it was,
the kiddies from our estate

26:31.337 --> 26:35.337
thank you from the bottom
of their potless little hearts.

26:39.177 --> 26:42.855
And, as a token of our appreciation,
there's drinks

26:42.857 --> 26:46.857
and nibbles at our house.

26:49.017 --> 26:53.017
I struggle to believe that
one of our girls put £10,000

26:54.217 --> 26:56.215
into that bucket?

26:56.217 --> 27:00.217
So do I. Don't,
you'll set me off again.

27:01.297 --> 27:05.297
No. Start you off or not,
you can't keep that money.

27:06.617 --> 27:10.415
On about? I've already ordered
the felt for the roof.

27:10.417 --> 27:12.815
There's strict protocol.

27:12.817 --> 27:15.935
It was a Wilmslow branch donation
and other projects

27:15.937 --> 27:19.937
are further along the food chain,
been patient and waited their turn.

27:20.177 --> 27:22.415
Like St Marcy's gym needs to.

27:22.417 --> 27:23.775
Might take me

27:23.777 --> 27:27.777
a while to get used to the twisted
sense of humour from round your way.

27:28.537 --> 27:30.775
It may be convenient to
ignore our process,

27:30.777 --> 27:34.777
but that is the way we run
our civilised little society, Mimi.

27:35.497 --> 27:38.135
Mam! Mam!

27:38.137 --> 27:42.137
We've left Scouse Macka
with ten kilo of weed...

27:44.697 --> 27:46.895
..in his boot.

27:46.897 --> 27:50.897
Have you got his home phone number?

27:53.897 --> 27:57.897
Excuse me a moment.

28:02.417 --> 28:06.417
I don't do this any more!

28:07.177 --> 28:09.895
This is the last time, I promise.

28:09.897 --> 28:13.897
0151...

28:15.657 --> 28:19.657
Me, me, me. Always the drama queen!

28:19.897 --> 28:21.815
Mimi? Mimi?

28:21.817 --> 28:24.975
Mimi,
can we continue our conversation?

28:24.977 --> 28:28.977
Deeds speak louder than words,
Edith.

28:29.097 --> 28:32.535
That money is St Marcy's.

28:32.537 --> 28:36.537
Extraordinary meeting on the cards
next week, ladies.

28:40.017 --> 28:44.017
Seems like an unusual scenario has
just pushed its way to the

28:45.177 --> 28:49.177
top of the agenda.

28:50.097 --> 28:54.097
Right then. Come along, ladies.

29:00.577 --> 29:04.577
Mimi... what your son just mentioned.

29:05.977 --> 29:09.977
It's been a long time
since my university days...

29:11.457 --> 29:15.457
Know what I mean?

29:18.017 --> 29:19.775
Aahh!

29:19.777 --> 29:23.777
Party!

29:41.937 --> 29:44.855
You can stamp all over that and
it'll still blow your bollocks off.

29:44.857 --> 29:47.935
Best flake in Manchester.

29:57.257 --> 29:59.295
We smashed it, bro!

29:59.297 --> 30:00.855
What happened to your eye?!

30:00.857 --> 30:03.695
Nothing, and no-one followed,
it's sweet.

30:03.697 --> 30:06.375
Right, get your cousin on the phone.
And we want a better price.

30:06.377 --> 30:07.855
It's not down to me.

30:07.857 --> 30:11.857
You don't want to see your mates get
took advantage of, do you?

30:15.737 --> 30:17.455
I'll have a word.

30:17.457 --> 30:20.135
Why am I the one
running all over the gaff?

30:20.137 --> 30:22.335
Mam said we're equal partners, yeah?

30:22.337 --> 30:26.255
The Jockey's our base. People like
continuity, I've gotta stay here.

30:26.257 --> 30:29.575
It's taken years to build up trust.

30:29.577 --> 30:33.577
A word.

30:38.297 --> 30:42.297
Back room.

30:51.697 --> 30:55.697
Wait here, mate.

31:05.057 --> 31:06.535
Might need stitches.

31:06.537 --> 31:08.695
Look,
somebody was bound to fight back.

31:08.697 --> 31:10.735
Yeah.
That's why we didn't bring you.

31:10.737 --> 31:12.135
You know it's not worth it.

31:12.137 --> 31:14.575
I won't feel a thing
when I see Mimi's happy face.

31:14.577 --> 31:16.335
What's she going to say about that?

31:16.337 --> 31:20.337
I'll just give her some
bullshit story.

31:31.097 --> 31:32.975
Well, the student wasn't lying.

31:32.977 --> 31:34.495
What happened?

31:34.497 --> 31:36.975
Two customers taxed in a week.
Something's fucked up.

31:36.977 --> 31:38.815
What are you looking at me for?

31:38.817 --> 31:42.575
Loose lips sink ships, mate.
It's gotta be someone close to home.

31:42.577 --> 31:46.577
Hey, listen, I don't know what
come over me earlier.

31:46.737 --> 31:50.737
Hey, let me buy you all a drink,
smooth things over.

31:53.617 --> 31:56.175
You rush in, and you're wrong?

31:56.177 --> 31:59.923
Then you'll never find out
who it really is. We need proof.

32:07.183 --> 32:09.663
No way!
I bet that's illegal in Wilmslow.

32:10.330 --> 32:14.088
I caught three of them
plating each other in the bathroom!

32:14.090 --> 32:18.090
It's looking better.
Let the air get to it.

32:18.170 --> 32:21.168
Do you think Edith's got any
say in me joining the club?

32:21.170 --> 32:23.168
No. They vote.
And after last night's party,

32:23.170 --> 32:25.328
you'll have Edith's
chair as well as her house.

32:25.330 --> 32:29.330
She's a fucking cheeky bitch.
That 10k's St Marcy's.

32:29.570 --> 32:32.648
If I can raise 13 grand so quick...

32:32.650 --> 32:36.650
we'll build a gym,
then a science block.

32:37.890 --> 32:41.890
That big donation's just the start,
it's bound to attract others.

32:42.090 --> 32:44.968
The momentum is with us.

32:44.970 --> 32:47.248
Fancy a cuppa tea, lad?

32:47.250 --> 32:51.250
Yeah.

32:57.090 --> 32:58.728
Not as friendly as the Chatsworth.

32:58.730 --> 33:00.608
They will be once you
get to know them.

33:00.610 --> 33:02.728
What are you actually going to do
with your days?

33:02.730 --> 33:04.048
I'll be building the gym.

33:04.050 --> 33:05.608
That's not going to take forever.

33:05.610 --> 33:06.728
I'll take classes.

33:06.730 --> 33:10.730
What, flower arranging? Like that's
going to get your adrenaline
pumping.

33:19.210 --> 33:21.648
Tell me the Scouse
Macka fiasco was a one-off?

33:21.650 --> 33:22.888
I wish I could.

33:22.890 --> 33:24.848
So they're not
grafting in harmony then?

33:24.850 --> 33:26.968
You've seen Jamie
and Shane agree on anything?

33:26.970 --> 33:29.488
Mutual dislike of Billy?

33:29.490 --> 33:31.728
And Jamie's
got his doubts about Benny.

33:31.730 --> 33:35.328
That dopey labrador's more loyal
to the Maguires than his own family.

33:35.330 --> 33:36.968
What's he worried about?

33:36.970 --> 33:38.848
Somebody's taxing our punters.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.208
What do you mean?

33:40.210 --> 33:42.568
What I said.

33:42.570 --> 33:44.568
That's never happened to us.

33:44.570 --> 33:48.570
Could be somebody testing
the new regime?

34:15.489 --> 34:17.808
You're not in Cheshire yet.

34:17.810 --> 34:20.328
Mapley Walk. Five minutes away.
I recognised the kid.

34:20.330 --> 34:23.168
He's a absolute nugget.
Wears bigger glasses than Lillian.

34:23.170 --> 34:26.208
- He could still be connected though.
- You sound like him.

34:26.210 --> 34:28.728
- Haven't you learnt your lesson?
- I can't be late for this ball.

34:28.730 --> 34:32.007
It's five minutes. He'll be even
easier than the student.

34:32.010 --> 34:36.010
Mimi needs these funds, man.

34:36.130 --> 34:40.130
Come on. Yess!

34:43.170 --> 34:44.688
And that's stopping them, is it?!

34:44.690 --> 34:48.047
What am I supposed to do?

34:48.050 --> 34:50.848
Vinny the Red... 0767...

34:50.850 --> 34:53.328
Oh, God! What the fuck?!

34:53.330 --> 34:55.408
It's OK.

34:55.409 --> 34:59.410
Out with the old, in with the new...

35:00.290 --> 35:02.968
Are you fucking mental?!

35:02.970 --> 35:05.288
Whatever it takes to be with you.

35:05.290 --> 35:08.168
Sell my soul and join the dark side.

35:08.170 --> 35:10.288
Partner in life, partner in crime...

35:10.290 --> 35:13.688
This can't carry on.

35:13.690 --> 35:17.648
Now Mimi's left,
I appreciate you've got no choice.

35:17.650 --> 35:21.650
You'll never go straight. But that's
OK. I'll leave the police...

35:21.810 --> 35:25.810
you're all that matters.

35:27.730 --> 35:31.728
Never, ever, ever contact me again,
OK?

35:31.730 --> 35:33.888
Destiny, my love.

35:33.890 --> 35:37.890
Fuck off!

35:41.170 --> 35:45.170
However long it takes,
I'll be there.

35:50.250 --> 35:53.688
Where is it?!

35:53.690 --> 35:55.010
Where is it?!

36:11.490 --> 36:12.488
Oh fuck!

36:12.490 --> 36:13.688
What's happened?

36:13.690 --> 36:16.488
How do I know?

36:16.490 --> 36:17.688
Let's get out of here.

36:17.690 --> 36:19.448
No, go and see what's
going on first.

36:19.450 --> 36:23.450
You go and see!

36:43.370 --> 36:44.688
What is going on?

36:44.690 --> 36:46.688
Ches! Tell me what's going on.

36:46.690 --> 36:50.690
Let's just get out of here.

36:55.130 --> 36:58.288
You have got to be fucking joking!

36:58.290 --> 37:02.048
Billy?!

37:02.050 --> 37:06.050
Fucking hell, mate.
I thought I was dead.

37:06.650 --> 37:10.650
Never been a mate of mine.

37:13.770 --> 37:15.608
Where's Benny?

37:15.610 --> 37:19.610
Benny?

37:21.210 --> 37:25.168
You?
Double crossing your own family?

37:25.170 --> 37:26.728
Bring us to the brink of war?

37:26.730 --> 37:29.128
Make me doubt those that've been
loyal for years?

37:29.130 --> 37:29.808
We're sorry...

37:29.810 --> 37:31.088
You will be.

37:31.090 --> 37:35.090
With this bally on I can put
a bullet between your fucking eyes,
mate...

37:36.130 --> 37:38.088
How were we to know it was Billy,
eh?

37:38.090 --> 37:41.088
Now's probably not the best time
to make Mam a widow.

37:41.090 --> 37:45.090
No, she'll get over it. She's lost
plenty close to her already.

37:45.690 --> 37:46.848
Put it on.

37:46.850 --> 37:47.768
Jamie, please...

37:47.770 --> 37:48.888
On!

37:48.890 --> 37:51.648
Shane, tell him!
Jamie, I'm begging you... please!

37:51.650 --> 37:54.448
She's already cuckoo.
This could proper send her under.

37:54.450 --> 37:58.328
There's no way this little fucker's
leaving with just a black eye.

37:58.330 --> 38:01.490
No, no, Jamie, no!

38:11.130 --> 38:14.608
No Billy?

38:14.610 --> 38:17.088
Where's Jamie? Shane?

38:17.090 --> 38:18.168
Why, what's going on?

38:18.170 --> 38:20.128
Billy's in trouble!

38:20.130 --> 38:21.730
Stay here.

38:22.970 --> 38:26.368
As if things aren't hard enough, eh?
Feds, customs.

38:26.370 --> 38:28.608
Every day, something to stop you
earning a living

38:28.610 --> 38:32.610
without one of your own shafting
you from behind.

38:33.010 --> 38:34.048
Please, Jamie.

38:34.050 --> 38:35.088
Paracetamol?

38:35.090 --> 38:36.288
Yeah. Better than nothing.

38:36.290 --> 38:37.528
Please... Think of Mimi.

38:37.530 --> 38:41.530
Pushing you around in a wheelchair
will keep her fit.

38:45.410 --> 38:46.888
Jamie!

38:46.890 --> 38:48.288
Kneecapping my husband?!

38:48.290 --> 38:49.368
As if?!

38:49.370 --> 38:50.808
It was shitting him up.

38:50.810 --> 38:51.688
This better be good.

38:51.690 --> 38:53.768
He's the one behind the taxing.

38:53.770 --> 38:56.088
That's worse than being a grass!

38:56.090 --> 38:57.728
It was for the gym.

38:57.730 --> 38:59.008
The ten grand?

38:59.010 --> 39:00.448
Where's the rest?

39:00.450 --> 39:02.288
That's all his cousin would give.

39:02.290 --> 39:04.568
I've still got the last lot.

39:04.570 --> 39:05.968
I'm sorry.

39:05.970 --> 39:07.328
It wasn't one of the girls?

39:07.330 --> 39:10.168
Fuck the gym. What about this prick?

39:10.170 --> 39:11.368
Compensation?!

39:11.370 --> 39:15.370
Why? Laurel and Hardy here
have done you a fucking favour.

39:15.610 --> 39:19.568
Snap you out of your complacency,
tighten up your security.

39:19.570 --> 39:22.728
Cos you're obviously not coping too
fucking well on your own.

39:22.730 --> 39:26.730
Come on.

39:31.610 --> 39:34.368
I know your heart's in the right
place, and Jamie and Shane

39:34.370 --> 39:36.048
have been disrespectful.

39:36.050 --> 39:38.928
But taxing other grafters
is the lowest of the low.

39:38.930 --> 39:41.568
I know. I'm on it.

39:41.570 --> 39:45.528
And I know those Wilmslow dirty
bitches are a tight-fisted bunch

39:45.530 --> 39:48.688
of free-loaders, but we've
give two ton for these tickets

39:48.690 --> 39:52.690
so Mimi Tutton is going the ball...

40:12.890 --> 40:16.890
Hi.

40:18.610 --> 40:21.248
Hi.

40:21.250 --> 40:25.208
Nice suit, Billy.

40:25.210 --> 40:26.408
Now we're all here,

40:26.410 --> 40:30.410
I'd like to say something more about
the recent flaunting of the rules.

40:32.130 --> 40:33.248
Not now, surely?

40:33.250 --> 40:37.250
No time like the present,
and I'm nothing if not efficient.
Excuse me.

40:38.690 --> 40:42.690
Some interesting CCTV footage has
recently come to light...

40:43.730 --> 40:47.730
The mystery donor in action.

40:58.490 --> 41:02.490
There was never any intention
of a kiddies' gym.

41:02.690 --> 41:06.690
Chatsworth's Ma Baker and her
fashion-conscious toyboy

41:09.490 --> 41:13.490
use anonymous
donations to wash dirty money.

41:13.970 --> 41:15.728
That's not true.

41:15.730 --> 41:19.730
Us gullible fools are all
part of the camouflage.

41:20.010 --> 41:22.048
Mimi knew nothing about it.

41:22.050 --> 41:23.888
Don't embarrass yourself further.

41:23.890 --> 41:27.088
It was all my doing
cos she cared so much.

41:27.090 --> 41:28.768
She's been on the PTA for months.

41:28.770 --> 41:30.968
Donated all her spare time
to that school.

41:30.970 --> 41:34.970
Laundering any illicit earnings
is unpalatable.

41:35.250 --> 41:39.050
Drug money has the worst
possible taste.

41:40.650 --> 41:44.650
Absolutely.

41:45.690 --> 41:49.208
Fancy a little line, Pru?

41:49.210 --> 41:52.608
Mavis? Oh, Beryl?

41:52.610 --> 41:55.728
Gone all shy in front
of your husband?

41:55.730 --> 41:58.848
Oh, it was different
the other night...

41:58.850 --> 42:02.850
Yeah. Drugs do bring out the worst
possible taste.

42:03.130 --> 42:07.130
And you're all the worst
kind of hypocrites.

42:10.810 --> 42:13.688
Oh...

42:13.690 --> 42:16.688
Ever seen Pru lick a fanny?

42:16.690 --> 42:20.248
Or Beryl get her fanny licked?

42:20.250 --> 42:22.848
And there's plenty more where
that came from.

42:22.850 --> 42:26.328
And you know who you are.

42:26.330 --> 42:30.330
C'mon, babe.

42:36.170 --> 42:37.610
Fuck off!

42:57.370 --> 42:58.888
The only time, in history,

42:58.890 --> 43:01.448
a Maguire's gone
voluntarily to the odd lot.

43:01.450 --> 43:04.888
Can she even stay in the feds with
a restraining order against her?

43:04.890 --> 43:06.488
Well, she should have thought of
that

43:06.490 --> 43:08.648
before she turned
psycho-bitch, shouldn't she?

43:08.650 --> 43:12.208
Keep a distance of 102 feet.

43:12.210 --> 43:13.808
I'm not sure you're worth it.

43:13.810 --> 43:15.128
Piss off.

43:15.130 --> 43:19.130
Get out of it, you fucking weirdo!

43:29.850 --> 43:33.128
'The grass is always greener
and all that.

43:33.130 --> 43:37.130
'Might not be as potent if your
hydroponics aren't up to much,
though.

43:37.970 --> 43:39.728
'Try different flavours.

43:39.730 --> 43:42.088
'Dabble in a variety of lifestyles,

43:42.090 --> 43:44.128
'venture beyond new horizons,

43:44.130 --> 43:48.130
'add exotic squares to your patchwork
quilt of experience.

43:48.330 --> 43:52.330
'But not all of us are meant to stray
too far, or for too long.'

43:53.090 --> 43:57.090
Getting something built round here
should never be underestimated.

43:58.130 --> 44:00.808
This has always
been about the kiddies.

44:00.810 --> 44:04.810
And the kiddies decided how
they wanted the money to be spent.

44:06.170 --> 44:10.170
This is as vital to pupil morale
as any new gym.

44:10.850 --> 44:14.368
In many ways more so.

44:14.370 --> 44:18.088
And it is now, with great pleasure

44:18.090 --> 44:22.090
that I pronounce
Mimi's Tuck Shop officially open!

44:26.530 --> 44:29.808
'When you return to who you know,
and what you know,

44:29.810 --> 44:32.488
'be sure no resentment lingers.

44:32.490 --> 44:36.448
'If people need you, love you,
want you around,

44:36.450 --> 44:40.450
'feed off that.
It's a privilege in itself.'

44:42.850 --> 44:44.248
I'm looking for the janitor.

44:44.250 --> 44:45.808
Frank? Frank. Aye. That's him.

44:45.810 --> 44:47.688
There's a man with a gun!

44:47.690 --> 44:49.088
Everyone accounted for?

44:49.090 --> 44:50.208
Thalia Blanco went to the

44:50.210 --> 44:52.888
toilet before the alarm went off.
I haven't seen her since.

44:52.890 --> 44:54.688
You must be Frank.

44:54.690 --> 44:57.328
This mad bitch locked my daughter in
a cupboard with a gun man!

44:57.330 --> 45:01.208
My name's Baxter. You've been
pumping my missus, Frank.

45:01.210 --> 45:03.648
- He's never done this before.
- Get out the way!

45:03.650 --> 45:04.688
Monica?

45:04.690 --> 45:06.328
I'm the mother!

45:06.330 --> 45:08.008
Clear shot, ma'am.

45:08.010 --> 45:09.058
Take it. Shit!

45:09.083 --> 45:49.178
