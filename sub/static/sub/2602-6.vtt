00:01.587 --> 00:02.854
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
<i>-  Whoa!</i>

00:02.855 --> 00:04.089
Settle.

00:04.090 --> 00:05.757
Sorry, sarge.

00:05.758 --> 00:08.860
Ugh, Halloween is the worst.

00:08.861 --> 00:10.862
Everyone's drunk,
wearing a mask,

00:10.863 --> 00:12.564
and carrying a fake gun.

00:12.565 --> 00:14.666
Plus all the girls think
they have to dress sexy.

00:14.701 --> 00:17.669
I know, that is the worst.
Please make them stop.

00:17.704 --> 00:19.171
I passed a slutty tree
on the way here.

00:19.172 --> 00:20.973
Who wants to have sex
with a tree?

00:21.074 --> 00:22.306
Was it a maple?

00:22.307 --> 00:23.774
Was it a maple?

00:23.775 --> 00:25.809
<i>Buon giorno,
buon giorno.</i>

00:25.810 --> 00:28.479
- Pretty cool 'stume, huh?
- 'Stume?

00:28.480 --> 00:30.080
Short for costume.
Ah.

00:30.081 --> 00:32.348
All right, let me guess.
You are dumpy Chuck Norris.

00:32.350 --> 00:33.650
No, I'm...
Dumpy Ron Weasley.

00:33.651 --> 00:34.952
No.

00:34.953 --> 00:36.420
<i>You guys, stop it.</i>

00:36.421 --> 00:38.155
He put thought
into his costume,

00:38.156 --> 00:40.891
and he is obviously Miranda
from <i>Sex and the City.</i>

00:40.892 --> 00:42.092
Guys, I'm Mario Batali!

00:42.093 --> 00:44.628
"Molto Mario"?
Celebrity chef?

00:44.629 --> 00:46.196
Ginger Prince
of little Italy?

00:46.197 --> 00:48.098
Is he also
a homeless troll doll?

00:48.099 --> 00:49.399
'Cause you look like
a homeless troll doll.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.602
Hey, sweet Batali costume,
dude.

00:51.603 --> 00:53.136
Thank you!

00:53.137 --> 00:54.738
There's a man
with impeccable taste.

00:54.772 --> 00:58.141
He bit a guy's butt off
at a W.N.B.A. game.

00:58.142 --> 00:59.376
Eric Stoltz from <i>Mask</i>.

00:59.410 --> 01:01.111
I'll take it.
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:01.145 --> 01:03.280
I hope you're all
well rested.

01:03.281 --> 01:05.048
It's gonna be
a busy night.

01:05.049 --> 01:06.250
The holding cell's
completely full.

01:06.284 --> 01:07.784
I keep having to separate

01:07.785 --> 01:09.236
Hillary Clinton
and Kim Jong-Un.

01:09.254 --> 01:11.622
Stop it!
Stop making out!

01:11.656 --> 01:14.391
Hey... no!
What would bill say?

01:14.425 --> 01:15.893
<i>We need two undercovers</i>

01:15.894 --> 01:17.394
at the Dekalb street
warehouse party.

01:17.395 --> 01:20.130
Boyle, you're already
in costume as, uh,

01:20.131 --> 01:21.398
Joy Behar?

01:21.399 --> 01:22.599
I'm Mario Batali.

01:22.600 --> 01:24.668
Okay.
And, uh, Santiago,

01:24.669 --> 01:25.903
you go with him.

01:25.904 --> 01:28.071
Yes, sir.
Damn it.

01:28.072 --> 01:30.741
Santiago, I know
that you hate Halloween,

01:30.742 --> 01:32.442
but stick with me,
and I promise you,

01:32.443 --> 01:33.877
you will love it.

01:33.912 --> 01:35.145
Can you magically make everyone
kind, sober,

01:35.146 --> 01:36.413
and fully dressed?

01:36.447 --> 01:38.081
"Kind, sober,
and fully dressed."

01:38.082 --> 01:39.449
Good news, everyone,
we found the name

01:39.450 --> 01:41.618
of Santiago's sex tape.

02:02.740 --> 02:05.475
Well, ring it up, nerds.

02:05.476 --> 02:07.477
I just arrested
my first Halloween idiot

02:07.478 --> 02:08.745
of the season.

02:08.746 --> 02:10.113
He was trying to rob a bank

02:10.114 --> 02:12.149
but had a little trouble
with the getaway.

02:12.183 --> 02:14.685
Trying to "split," huh?

02:14.686 --> 02:17.487
Don't worry, I'm sure you'll
get out on "a peel."

02:17.522 --> 02:18.822
I'm so glad you're stuck.

02:18.856 --> 02:20.324
I've got a million of these.

02:20.358 --> 02:22.267
No, no, don't touch the money!
<i>Ugh!</i>

02:22.293 --> 02:23.994
I swear,
these perps are so stupid.

02:23.995 --> 02:25.495
I'd make a better criminal
than any of them.

02:25.530 --> 02:27.297
Yeah, you would.
You'd be an evil mastermind,

02:27.298 --> 02:29.132
and everyone would call you
the handsome bandit.

02:29.133 --> 02:31.068
<i>Thank you, Charles.
And the best part is,</i>

02:31.102 --> 02:33.103
none of you could catch me.

02:34.505 --> 02:35.772
I'm fairly certain
you would be caught.

02:35.773 --> 02:37.040
<i>No, scratch that.</i>

02:37.041 --> 02:39.343
I'm 100% sure
you'd be caught.

02:39.377 --> 02:40.978
Ho, ho, ho!

02:40.979 --> 02:42.446
All right,
challenge accepted.

02:42.480 --> 02:43.981
I didn't issue a challenge.
Fine.

02:44.015 --> 02:45.616
I'll issue it for you.

02:45.617 --> 02:47.050
What's the most valuable thing
in your office?

02:47.051 --> 02:48.418
My medal of valor.

02:48.453 --> 02:49.886
God, you are such a hero.

02:49.887 --> 02:51.855
All right, how about this?
I will bet you

02:51.856 --> 02:53.523
that by midnight tonight,

02:53.524 --> 02:55.359
I can steal the medal of valor
from your office.

02:55.360 --> 02:57.694
<i>Why would I possibly
agree to that?</i>

02:57.729 --> 02:59.062
Because if I lose,
I'll work

02:59.063 --> 03:00.297
the next five weekends,
no overtime.

03:00.331 --> 03:01.698
And I won't tell
anyone here

03:01.733 --> 03:03.066
about the time I saw you
wearing short shorts

03:03.067 --> 03:04.301
outside of work.

03:04.335 --> 03:05.636
But if I win...
You won't.

03:05.637 --> 03:07.204
You have to do all
of my paperwork tonight,

03:07.205 --> 03:10.474
the busiest and spookiest night
of the year.

03:10.508 --> 03:13.010
And you have
to publicly state

03:13.044 --> 03:17.014
that I'm an amazing
Detective-slash-genius.

03:17.048 --> 03:19.182
And this won't interfere
with you doing your job?

03:19.183 --> 03:22.886
You mean my job as an amazing
Detective-slash-genius?

03:22.887 --> 03:24.187
No, it will not.
I'll do all of my work,

03:24.188 --> 03:25.389
guaranteed.

03:25.423 --> 03:27.024
I'm considering it.

03:27.025 --> 03:28.325
I'm interested.

03:28.326 --> 03:30.827
I agree to participate.
All right.

03:30.862 --> 03:33.397
There's the robot
I fell in love with.

03:33.431 --> 03:34.731
<i>Hey.</i>

03:34.732 --> 03:36.500
Sister Steve here
got mugged.

03:36.534 --> 03:37.901
Some guy dressed
as the royal baby

03:37.935 --> 03:40.003
punched him
and took his wallet.

03:40.004 --> 03:41.405
She keeps laughing at me.

03:41.439 --> 03:42.839
Can't tell you how many nuns

03:42.874 --> 03:44.174
I wanted to beat up
in catholic school.

03:44.175 --> 03:45.575
Ten.

03:45.576 --> 03:47.519
I didn't know you went
to catholic school.

03:47.545 --> 03:49.179
Good.
You shouldn't know it.

03:49.213 --> 03:51.915
I get it.
You're so mysterious and tough.

03:51.916 --> 03:53.400
But you know what I think?

03:53.418 --> 03:55.085
You're actually
a big softy.

03:55.119 --> 03:56.611
No, I think
she's really mean.

03:56.621 --> 03:58.088
You probably read
a Maya angelou poem

03:58.089 --> 03:59.948
at your graduation
and cried.

03:59.957 --> 04:01.625
Didn't graduate.
Had to leave.

04:01.626 --> 04:02.959
Why?
What'd you do?

04:02.960 --> 04:04.728
Here's a hint.

04:04.729 --> 04:07.297
I'm not gonna tell you.

04:07.298 --> 04:10.200
Oh, I'm gonna find out
anyway.

04:10.201 --> 04:11.435
I'm a Detective.

04:11.436 --> 04:13.904
I will detect!

04:13.905 --> 04:15.305
Hey.

04:15.306 --> 04:17.040
Got an arrest file here
for the Captain.

04:17.041 --> 04:18.442
Drunk and disorderly.

04:18.476 --> 04:20.277
So, anyways...

04:20.278 --> 04:21.745
Gina!

04:21.745 --> 04:23.213
We never talk anymore.

04:23.247 --> 04:24.848
How's the dance troupe?
Did you get a haircut?

04:24.882 --> 04:26.249
What's the Captain's
schedule like today?

04:26.284 --> 04:28.185
I'm not gonna help you
rob him, Jake.

04:28.219 --> 04:30.287
I'm his assistant,
and I take that job

04:30.321 --> 04:31.980
incredibly seriously.

04:31.989 --> 04:33.256
You're literally making
paper airplanes

04:33.257 --> 04:34.991
out of police reports
right now.

04:34.992 --> 04:36.660
Well, how am I supposed to get
it into that garbage can?

04:36.661 --> 04:37.928
<i>Please, Gina?</i>

04:37.962 --> 04:39.496
Fine, Captain's got
a meeting

04:39.497 --> 04:41.431
downstairs in ten minutes.

04:41.466 --> 04:44.267
You're the best.
Mwah!

04:44.268 --> 04:45.635
What does your skin taste like?

04:45.670 --> 04:47.771
Dina Lohan.
I'm wearing her face lotion.

04:47.805 --> 04:49.606
That's it.

04:49.640 --> 04:51.441
Thank you.

04:51.442 --> 04:53.376
Okay, party's
around the corner.

04:53.411 --> 04:55.779
Tipster said there'll be
a huge amount of drug activity.

04:55.813 --> 04:58.181
Why is this costume
so stiff?

04:58.182 --> 05:00.150
And what is that smell?

05:00.151 --> 05:01.952
The department never washes
them, so it's probably vomit.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.186
Hey!

05:03.187 --> 05:05.288
I got you a chocolate.

05:05.289 --> 05:07.991
Yet another great thing
about Halloween... chocolate!

05:08.025 --> 05:09.993
Thanks.
Oh, look.

05:09.994 --> 05:12.162
Raggedy Ann is drinking vodka
right from the bottle.

05:12.163 --> 05:13.864
<i>People think
if they put on a costume,</i>

05:13.865 --> 05:16.366
<i>they can just get away
with anything they want.</i>

05:16.367 --> 05:19.402
Halloween is Christmas
for jerks.

05:19.437 --> 05:21.505
Come on, ma'am.
No open containers.

05:21.539 --> 05:25.342
Oh, and why should I listen
to you, bone person?

05:25.343 --> 05:28.011
It's called skelon.
It's a very common word.

05:28.045 --> 05:29.513
Just put the vodka away.

05:29.514 --> 05:30.781
<i>You guys are cops?</i>

05:30.782 --> 05:32.282
These guys are cops!

05:41.626 --> 05:43.360
Are you in my ceiling,
Peralta?

05:43.394 --> 05:45.128
<i>No.</i>

05:45.129 --> 05:46.563
So what's the plan?

05:46.564 --> 05:47.864
You wait for me
to leave my office,

05:47.865 --> 05:49.232
lower yourself down,
take my medal,

05:49.233 --> 05:50.467
and win the bet?

05:50.501 --> 05:51.735
<i>Who are you talking to?</i>

05:51.736 --> 05:53.520
<i>There's no one up here.</i>

05:53.538 --> 05:55.138
Peralta,
just so you know,

05:55.139 --> 05:57.808
right now, I am taking
my medal off the wall

05:57.809 --> 05:59.810
and placing it
in a locked safe

05:59.811 --> 06:01.653
whose combination is known
only to me.

06:01.679 --> 06:03.613
The safe, in turn,

06:03.648 --> 06:05.215
is locked in the cabinet.

06:05.249 --> 06:09.653
The only key to that cabinet
is on my person.

06:09.654 --> 06:12.022
I'm off to my meeting.
Good luck with your plan.

06:12.023 --> 06:14.524
<i>You think that scares me?</i>

06:14.559 --> 06:17.561
<i>I laugh in the face
of adversity!</i>

06:17.595 --> 06:19.262
<i>Are you still there?</i>

06:19.263 --> 06:20.697
<i>Captain, are you still there?
I can't hear...</i>

06:20.698 --> 06:23.200
Agh!

06:23.201 --> 06:24.994
<i>Ow.</i>

06:27.219 --> 06:28.627
Here you go.

06:28.628 --> 06:31.262
Don't touch the butter.

06:31.297 --> 06:32.831
What happened?
I thought you guys

06:32.832 --> 06:34.099
were supposed to be
at the warehouse party.

06:34.100 --> 06:35.467
We got egged.

06:35.468 --> 06:37.168
Some of the shell
got in my contacts

06:37.169 --> 06:39.738
and my hair and my mouth
and my bra.

06:39.772 --> 06:41.006
I can't tell
if that's hot or not.

06:41.007 --> 06:42.273
Not hot.

06:42.274 --> 06:43.508
Eggshell in my bra
is not hot.

06:43.509 --> 06:44.776
Well, it's kinda hot.

06:44.777 --> 06:47.946
Boobs go in a bra.
Up top.

06:47.947 --> 06:50.115
Whoo! My man.

06:50.116 --> 06:52.183
Well, it sounds like
costume duty is going great.

06:52.184 --> 06:53.618
So great.
We're having the best time.

06:53.619 --> 06:54.819
Right, Amy?

06:54.854 --> 06:56.621
I wish I was dead.
<i>Hmm.</i>

06:56.656 --> 06:58.289
How's the unwinnable bet going?

06:58.324 --> 06:59.624
Well, on the one hand,
I fell through the ceiling

06:59.625 --> 07:01.459
and onto a pencil,
but on the other hand,

07:01.460 --> 07:03.161
I also badly bruised
my brain.

07:03.195 --> 07:04.529
If you wanted to make
a bet with Holt,

07:04.530 --> 07:05.864
you shoulda made a bet
you could win.

07:05.865 --> 07:07.499
Like who wears
more denim jackets.

07:07.533 --> 07:09.134
That was one time.

07:09.168 --> 07:10.802
You guys never forget
anything.

07:10.803 --> 07:12.137
You know, frankly,
I'm a little surprised

07:12.138 --> 07:13.605
you don't think
I can win this thing.

07:13.606 --> 07:15.273
You're always telling me
how I'm the best.

07:15.274 --> 07:17.375
You're the best, Jake.

07:17.376 --> 07:19.105
Paperwork delivery.

07:19.111 --> 07:20.412
You're the best, Jake.

07:20.446 --> 07:22.380
Jake, you're the best.

07:22.381 --> 07:24.149
Thank you, Charles.

07:24.183 --> 07:25.684
Yeah, maybe it's just Charles.

07:25.718 --> 07:27.519
<i>Look, Jake,</i>

07:27.553 --> 07:29.554
I love you like you're one of my daughters.
Really?

07:29.555 --> 07:31.790
But it's not about you
or how smart you are.

07:31.791 --> 07:33.024
It's about Captain Holt.

07:33.059 --> 07:34.592
The man's a genius.

07:34.627 --> 07:36.127
He's had your number
at every turn.

07:36.128 --> 07:40.298
Well, not this day...
Turn... time.

07:40.299 --> 07:43.468
Sorry, I'm pretty sure
I had a concussion back there.

07:43.502 --> 07:44.769
Here I come.
All right.

07:44.804 --> 07:48.206
Ohh, strong.
Ahh.

07:48.240 --> 07:50.175
<i>Okay, here's the first set</i>

07:50.176 --> 07:51.843
<i>of royal babies
I rounded up.</i>

07:51.844 --> 07:53.078
Popular costume.

07:53.079 --> 07:54.345
Any of these guys
look familiar?

07:54.346 --> 07:55.880
Maybe the third guy.

07:55.915 --> 07:57.482
The baby who mugged me
was pretty short.

07:58.818 --> 08:00.018
You're not supposed
to laugh at me.

08:00.052 --> 08:01.519
<i>Number three,</i>

08:01.554 --> 08:03.154
step forward and say,
"give me your money,

08:03.155 --> 08:04.522
you stupid bag of crap."

08:04.523 --> 08:07.358
Gimme your money,
you stupid bag of crap.

08:07.359 --> 08:08.727
No, wrong giant baby.

08:08.761 --> 08:10.028
I still want to know
why you got kicked out

08:10.029 --> 08:11.596
of catholic school.

08:11.597 --> 08:13.164
Were you doing drugs?

08:13.165 --> 08:16.000
Worse.
Selling drugs?

08:16.001 --> 08:19.337
Worse.
How bad could it have been?

08:19.338 --> 08:22.040
Did you burn down a church?

08:22.041 --> 08:24.909
Number three, step forward
and say the word

08:24.910 --> 08:26.211
"worse."

08:26.212 --> 08:28.913
Worse.

08:28.914 --> 08:30.715
Excuse me, Gina.

08:30.716 --> 08:32.049
I can't find Peralta anywhere,
and you're the only one

08:32.051 --> 08:33.721
who can decipher
his handwriting.

08:33.753 --> 08:36.386
He arrested that bunny,
but I don't know what for.

08:36.388 --> 08:39.390
He's either a crispy
mother werewolf

08:39.390 --> 08:42.260
or cowboy mustard,
oslo, Norway.

08:42.294 --> 08:43.727
Hmm.

08:43.729 --> 08:46.898
The bunny groped multiple women
on the subway.

08:46.932 --> 08:49.434
Being able to read
Jake's writing is a gift.

08:49.468 --> 08:51.569
A useless, useless gift.

08:51.570 --> 08:55.573
<i>Excuse me one second.</i>

08:55.574 --> 08:57.709
Nice costume, Peralta.

08:57.710 --> 08:59.544
No Peralta here.

08:59.545 --> 09:03.114
Just a normal janitor
pushing trash around.

09:03.115 --> 09:04.816
Come out of there.

09:06.452 --> 09:08.319
Captain, hey.

09:08.320 --> 09:09.554
You really thought
this was gonna work?

09:09.588 --> 09:10.822
Uh, it did work.

09:10.823 --> 09:12.090
This whole janitor gambit

09:12.091 --> 09:13.892
was designed to fail.

09:13.893 --> 09:15.160
It's just like in chess.

09:15.161 --> 09:16.594
Sometimes in order to win,

09:16.595 --> 09:18.096
you have to sacrifice
your king.

09:18.097 --> 09:19.831
That's exactly how
you lose in chess.

09:19.832 --> 09:21.132
Have you ever played
the game?

09:21.167 --> 09:22.567
Yeah, I used to play
with my uncle Bob

09:22.568 --> 09:24.402
all the time,
and he said I was great.

09:24.403 --> 09:26.604
This is a game
of concentration, Jake.

09:26.639 --> 09:29.641
So focus your mind,
and start shooting.

09:33.312 --> 09:35.814
Now you're a master
of chess, huh?

09:35.848 --> 09:37.182
He taught me how to shoot
backgammon too.

09:37.183 --> 09:38.583
I expected better
of you.

09:38.584 --> 09:39.851
You could have at least
created a diversion

09:39.852 --> 09:41.820
to distract me
from your terrible costume.

09:41.854 --> 09:43.454
Uh, I'm not a dumb butt.

09:43.455 --> 09:45.023
I had a diversion planned.

09:45.024 --> 09:47.859
There was just
a slight timing issue.

09:47.860 --> 09:49.327
Oh, my God!

09:49.361 --> 09:51.496
Get down, everyone!
There's a big fire!

09:51.497 --> 09:53.231
Captain, you better head
over there for, like,

09:53.265 --> 09:55.600
15 minutes and see what's
going on with that.

09:55.601 --> 09:58.603
Beware of the back draft.
I'll be in your office.

10:01.307 --> 10:03.174
You have beautiful eyes.

10:03.175 --> 10:04.442
<i>Have it your way.</i>

10:04.443 --> 10:06.344
But you're gonna need this.

10:06.345 --> 10:08.613
And... that.

10:08.614 --> 10:11.349
It's filthy in there.

10:17.022 --> 10:18.857
Come on, Amy!
Loosen up!

10:18.858 --> 10:20.158
You look like
such a cop!

10:20.192 --> 10:22.660
Come on, have some fun,
you know?

10:22.695 --> 10:24.963
It'll help you blend in!

10:24.964 --> 10:26.231
Whoo!

10:26.232 --> 10:28.833
Stop trying to get me
to love Halloween.

10:28.834 --> 10:30.468
It'll never work.

10:30.502 --> 10:31.736
I'm backing it up.

10:31.737 --> 10:34.505
Oh, God, please don't.

10:34.540 --> 10:36.708
Hey, heads up.

10:36.709 --> 10:37.976
I'll cut 'em off at the exit.
Okay.

10:37.977 --> 10:41.045
Move! Move, move!

10:41.046 --> 10:42.480
He ditched the drugs.
I'm on it.

10:42.481 --> 10:43.915
Ugh.

10:45.217 --> 10:47.552
Oof, everything
is sticking to me.

10:47.553 --> 10:48.887
Ooh.

10:48.888 --> 10:50.822
Ay, h.
Yes.

10:50.856 --> 10:52.824
<i>Hey, watch out, man.</i>

10:52.825 --> 10:54.826
Ugh! What is that?

10:54.827 --> 10:59.063
How is it hot <i>and</i> cold?

10:59.098 --> 11:02.100
So the soonest you can fix
the ceiling is Monday?

11:08.574 --> 11:11.376
I'm gonna have
to call you back.

11:11.410 --> 11:12.844
Wait, stop scratching me.

11:12.845 --> 11:14.048
We're supposed to be a team.

11:14.079 --> 11:15.747
Ahem.

11:15.748 --> 11:17.115
Captain, hi.

11:17.116 --> 11:19.751
<i>I was just photocopying
some stuff.</i>

11:19.785 --> 11:21.519
Are you trying to jam pigeons
into my air-conditioning vent

11:21.520 --> 11:22.754
to flush me
out of my office?

11:22.788 --> 11:25.056
Way to ruin the surprise.

11:25.090 --> 11:27.458
How did you get those birds?
<i>By using my big, fat brain.</i>

11:27.459 --> 11:29.227
Get in the bag,
you damn bird.

11:29.228 --> 11:30.461
Eat the bread.
Eat the bread!

11:30.462 --> 11:32.063
I gotcha!
I gotcha!

11:32.064 --> 11:34.933
All part of my elaborate plan
to defeat you.

11:34.934 --> 11:37.302
So far, you and
your big, fat brain

11:37.303 --> 11:39.203
are losing... badly.

11:39.204 --> 11:41.439
Maybe, if we're talking
about who's winning our bet.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.875
But if we're talking
about who's holding more birds,

11:43.876 --> 11:45.843
I'm winning,
four-nothing.

11:45.878 --> 11:48.913
You're only holding two.

11:48.914 --> 11:52.283
Yeah.

11:54.984 --> 11:56.217
Ooh, when you were
logging in the drugs,

11:56.218 --> 11:57.619
you missed
some awesome stuff.

11:57.620 --> 11:59.721
Guy walked by in full
astronaut costume,

11:59.722 --> 12:00.989
gave me a high five.

12:00.990 --> 12:03.157
He high-fived me too.

12:03.158 --> 12:04.459
Wait... Hitchcock?

12:04.460 --> 12:05.960
Darn it.

12:05.961 --> 12:07.228
I wasn't supposed to talk,
but I got so excited

12:07.229 --> 12:08.496
about that astronaut.

12:08.497 --> 12:10.131
What is happening?

12:10.165 --> 12:11.466
Amy paid me 50 bucks
to trade places with her

12:11.467 --> 12:12.734
for the rest of the night.

12:12.735 --> 12:14.102
Really?
Yeah.

12:14.136 --> 12:17.138
I'm gonna use that money
to buy two suits.

12:19.141 --> 12:21.509
Well, I was gonna ask you
to tell the Captain

12:21.510 --> 12:23.011
that I brought in royal babies
for Diaz,

12:23.012 --> 12:24.879
but I'm sure he already knows,

12:24.880 --> 12:26.147
since he's always one step
ahead of me.

12:26.148 --> 12:27.348
Aww.

12:27.383 --> 12:29.050
<i>Why so down, little clown?</i>

12:29.051 --> 12:30.318
<i>I'm just sick of losing
to Holt.</i>

12:30.319 --> 12:31.519
<i>I want that medal.</i>

12:31.553 --> 12:32.987
It's not real gold.

12:32.988 --> 12:35.290
I tried selling it online.
Zero bids.

12:35.324 --> 12:37.692
But here's some advice
I gave to the girls

12:37.726 --> 12:40.046
in my dance troupe at the "dance
till you drop" tournament.

12:40.062 --> 12:43.364
That advice was, dance.
Dance!

12:43.365 --> 12:45.033
<i>Dance.</i>

12:45.034 --> 12:47.869
Yeah, I'm not really sure
that applies here, Gina.

12:47.870 --> 12:49.938
It does apply.
It means don't give up.

12:49.939 --> 12:52.607
We would've won if
Natasha's water hadn't broken.

12:52.608 --> 12:54.542
Oh, Natasha had her baby?
You know Natasha?

12:54.543 --> 12:55.777
Yeah.
Yeah.

12:55.778 --> 12:57.045
Her dog has lupus.

12:57.046 --> 12:58.846
Yeah.
That's a trip.

12:58.847 --> 13:00.848
Small world.
Yes.

13:00.849 --> 13:05.720
All right, I'm gonna go cry.

13:05.721 --> 13:07.522
I kind of feel bad for him.

13:07.523 --> 13:08.723
<i>Don't.</i>

13:08.757 --> 13:10.458
He brought this on himself.

13:10.459 --> 13:14.762
You can hang up now.

13:14.763 --> 13:16.698
You paid money to get
out of working with me?

13:16.732 --> 13:18.766
Charles, I had to.
Tonight has been awful.

13:18.801 --> 13:21.569
Halloween is the worst,
and I don't understand

13:21.570 --> 13:22.937
why you like it.

13:22.972 --> 13:24.405
No, all the things
that you think are bad

13:24.406 --> 13:26.741
about Halloween
are what make it great.

13:26.775 --> 13:28.242
The big kids egg you.

13:28.243 --> 13:31.112
Then you and your friends
run away together.

13:31.113 --> 13:33.081
Friendships are forged
in the crucible

13:33.115 --> 13:35.483
of Halloween adversity.

13:35.484 --> 13:38.353
That's all I wanted
for us.

13:38.387 --> 13:43.224
You can keep the wig.
I don't need it anymore.

13:43.258 --> 13:46.327
I don't really need it either.

13:46.328 --> 13:47.662
<i>Hey, Captain Holt,</i>

13:47.663 --> 13:51.499
<i>can you come out here
for one sec?</i>

13:58.273 --> 14:00.274
You need something, Peralta?
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

14:00.309 --> 14:03.311
Hit it, royal babies.

14:14.089 --> 14:15.313
What... no!

14:15.324 --> 14:16.557
Give me my keys.

14:16.592 --> 14:18.259
Will you stop catching me?

14:18.260 --> 14:20.094
Do you have any idea how much
I spent on key chains?

14:20.129 --> 14:21.629
$23.

14:21.663 --> 14:23.031
Wow, that is
unbelievably close.

14:23.032 --> 14:24.465
22.76.

14:24.500 --> 14:27.101
Keys.
Okay, look.

14:27.102 --> 14:28.536
Tonight has been
a little humiliating.

14:28.537 --> 14:30.004
Things are not going well,

14:30.039 --> 14:31.606
so I'm gonna just
throw this out there.

14:31.640 --> 14:33.041
What do you say
we call off the bet

14:33.042 --> 14:34.442
and pretend this whole thing
never happened?

14:34.476 --> 14:35.943
Oh, I'm not letting you
off the hook.

14:35.978 --> 14:37.645
What? No. Pfft.

14:37.646 --> 14:40.515
I meant to give you an out,
so you could save face.

14:40.549 --> 14:42.483
This is getting sad.

14:42.484 --> 14:45.259
Yeah, for you.

14:45.287 --> 14:47.178
So.

14:47.189 --> 14:49.123
I called your school.

14:49.124 --> 14:53.961
And I managed to get a hold
of one sister Bernadette.

14:53.996 --> 14:56.464
I remember that old bag.
She was my favorite.

14:56.465 --> 14:57.799
Well, guess what she said.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.967
Apparently, you were
a model student

14:59.968 --> 15:03.037
and transferred
of your own volition.

15:05.374 --> 15:06.641
Fine.

15:06.642 --> 15:08.076
The reason I left
catholic school

15:08.077 --> 15:10.278
was because I got into
the american ballet academy.

15:10.312 --> 15:12.313
I was a classical dancer.

15:12.347 --> 15:13.815
And I was good.

15:13.849 --> 15:15.083
I knew it!

15:15.084 --> 15:16.851
I knew you were
a big softy.

15:16.885 --> 15:19.754
You tell anyone,
I break your face.

15:22.491 --> 15:26.259
No, you won't.
You're too sensitive.

15:28.063 --> 15:29.964
Captain, sorry to interrupt.

15:29.998 --> 15:32.233
<i>Some officers
just arrested Peralta.</i>

15:32.267 --> 15:33.634
What?
<i>They caught him scaling</i>

15:33.669 --> 15:35.536
the side of the building
with a blowtorch.

15:39.875 --> 15:41.509
Captain.

15:41.510 --> 15:43.144
Welcome to the endgame.

15:43.178 --> 15:44.679
Would you care to shake
the hand

15:44.713 --> 15:46.280
of the man
who defeated you?

15:46.281 --> 15:49.550
Forgot I was wearing handcuffs.
Ohh, that hurt.

15:49.551 --> 15:51.986
Whoo!

15:54.789 --> 15:56.256
Climbing the side of
the building with a blowtorch.

15:56.257 --> 15:57.591
What were you thinking?

15:57.625 --> 15:59.193
I was thinking I had
better core strength.

15:59.194 --> 16:00.427
I got winded, like,
ten feet up.

16:00.428 --> 16:02.196
I knew you wouldn't
win the bet,

16:02.197 --> 16:03.630
but your performance tonight
has made me question

16:03.631 --> 16:05.098
not only how good
a Detective you are,

16:05.099 --> 16:08.235
but, quite frankly,
how smart you are.

16:08.236 --> 16:10.537
Well, that's not surprising.
You constantly underestimate me.

16:10.538 --> 16:13.640
No, you've been
correctly estimated.

16:13.641 --> 16:16.076
You have five minutes
until your deadline,

16:16.077 --> 16:18.045
and here you are,
handcuffed to a table,

16:18.046 --> 16:19.413
in a locked room.

16:19.414 --> 16:23.417
Which is precisely
where I planned on being.

16:23.418 --> 16:25.118
Captain, let me tell you
a little story.

16:25.153 --> 16:26.954
You remember when
I fell through your ceiling?

16:26.955 --> 16:28.856
Yes, that was
six hours ago.

16:28.890 --> 16:30.991
It was, I admit,
a disastrous failure.

16:30.992 --> 16:33.327
But it gave me the idea
for Herman,

16:33.328 --> 16:34.795
the friendly janitor
you met.

16:34.829 --> 16:37.798
With Herman, I commenced
the perfect crime.

16:37.799 --> 16:40.033
I caught you as Herman.

16:40.068 --> 16:42.469
But you didn't catch Rosa.

16:42.470 --> 16:46.773
Come out of there.

16:46.774 --> 16:48.008
<i>It turns out that Rosa</i>

16:48.009 --> 16:50.043
<i>is great at picking locks.</i>

16:50.078 --> 16:52.446
Does not surprise me.
No, me neither.

16:52.447 --> 16:54.314
Of course, I had to find a way
to get her out of your office

16:54.315 --> 16:55.682
without you seeing her.

16:55.683 --> 16:57.618
<i>So I created a diversion.</i>

16:57.619 --> 17:00.587
Not mistimed...
Perfectly timed

17:00.588 --> 17:02.122
so she could escape unseen.

17:02.156 --> 17:03.423
What about the pigeons?

17:03.424 --> 17:04.925
Oh, the gray pigeons?

17:04.925 --> 17:06.727
<i>They were a red herring.
Thank you.</i>

17:06.761 --> 17:08.762
<i>Their only purpose was
to draw you into the copy room</i>

17:08.762 --> 17:12.933
<i>while two members of my team
broke into your locked office.</i>

17:12.967 --> 17:13.967
<i>So now I had a way
into your office</i>

17:13.968 --> 17:16.603
<i>and an open cabinet.</i>

17:16.637 --> 17:18.438
All that was left was
for the royal babies

17:18.439 --> 17:19.839
to steal your keys.

17:19.840 --> 17:21.808
Yes, but you didn't need
the keys.

17:21.809 --> 17:23.577
The cabinet
was already unlocked.

17:23.611 --> 17:24.944
You needed a way
into the safe.

17:24.945 --> 17:26.480
And I got it.

17:26.513 --> 17:27.948
<i>You were so concerned
with getting</i>

17:27.949 --> 17:29.216
<i>your keys back,
you didn't even notice</i>

17:29.217 --> 17:31.218
<i>the sergeant steal your phone.</i>

17:31.219 --> 17:33.654
<i>That's right, even
the sergeant is on my side.</i>

17:33.655 --> 17:35.822
<i>I then had Charles dust
your screen cover for prints.</i>

17:35.823 --> 17:37.491
<i>The greasiest smudges revealed</i>

17:37.492 --> 17:39.159
<i>the four numbers
you use the most...</i>

17:39.193 --> 17:41.295
The four numbers
in your passcode.

17:41.296 --> 17:42.996
Based on your advanced age,

17:42.997 --> 17:45.299
I assumed that you use the same
passcode for everything...

17:45.300 --> 17:47.467
Your phone, your email,
and, of course,

17:47.502 --> 17:48.735
your safe.

17:48.736 --> 17:51.278
That would be
a fair assumption.

17:51.306 --> 17:52.873
It was at that point
that I bumped into a girl

17:52.874 --> 17:55.876
dressed as a sexy robot,
and we got our flirt on... hard.

17:58.680 --> 17:59.980
'Sup?

18:00.014 --> 18:04.184
'Sup?
Jake Peralta.

18:04.218 --> 18:05.852
And how was flirting
part of the plan?

18:05.887 --> 18:08.021
Oh, it wasn't.
It just ruled.

18:08.022 --> 18:09.589
And that brings us
to five minutes ago,

18:09.590 --> 18:10.891
when Amy came to your office
and told you

18:10.892 --> 18:12.326
that I had been arrested.

18:12.327 --> 18:13.694
I knew she's the only one
you would believe

18:13.695 --> 18:15.329
because, frankly,
she's usually too lame

18:15.330 --> 18:17.138
to take part
in these kinds of things.

18:17.165 --> 18:19.099
And as you walked over here,

18:19.100 --> 18:20.667
Charles awkwardly stuffed
himself through your window

18:20.668 --> 18:23.170
and opened your safe.

18:23.204 --> 18:25.172
We had the four numbers
of your code, which meant

18:25.173 --> 18:27.374
there were 24 possible
combinations for Charles to try.

18:27.375 --> 18:29.042
That could take
up to four minutes,

18:29.043 --> 18:30.860
which is why I really dragged
out this explanation.

18:30.878 --> 18:33.113
I mean, really stretched it.
I don't know if you noticed,

18:33.114 --> 18:34.681
but there were times
where I was like,

18:34.716 --> 18:36.616
what am I even talking about?
This isn't...

18:36.617 --> 18:38.151
Oh.

18:38.186 --> 18:40.921
But now,
four minutes is up.

18:40.955 --> 18:43.090
Which means Boyle is either
on the other side of that door

18:43.091 --> 18:44.324
holding your medal,

18:44.359 --> 18:47.427
or I've lost.

18:47.462 --> 18:48.862
Well, Captain,

18:48.896 --> 18:50.364
<i>it seems that Jake</i>

18:50.365 --> 18:54.434
isn't the only person
you underestima...

18:54.435 --> 18:58.038
20 seconds to spare.
Game over, Captain.

18:58.039 --> 18:59.239
Check me.

18:59.273 --> 19:00.774
I think you mean "checkmate."

19:00.775 --> 19:02.275
You really need to learn
how to play chess.

19:02.276 --> 19:04.745
<i>How did you get everyone
to help you?</i>

19:04.746 --> 19:06.546
I appealed to their sense
of teamwork and camraderie

19:06.547 --> 19:09.049
with a rousing speech that would
put Shakespeare to shame.

19:09.083 --> 19:10.317
For too long,

19:10.318 --> 19:13.153
we've been put down,
ridiculed,

19:13.154 --> 19:15.055
made to wear ties!

19:15.089 --> 19:16.289
But no more!

19:16.324 --> 19:17.591
<i>For today,</i>

19:17.592 --> 19:19.593
we defeat him!

19:19.627 --> 19:22.203
And that worked?
No. No, no. Not at all.

19:22.230 --> 19:24.297
My speech did not inspire them.

19:24.332 --> 19:26.366
Come on.
So I bribed them.

19:26.401 --> 19:28.201
I told them that if we
pulled this off,

19:28.236 --> 19:29.803
I would do
all of their paperwork.

19:29.804 --> 19:32.072
And since you're doing
all my paperwork...

19:32.073 --> 19:33.907
I'm impressed, Peralta.

19:33.908 --> 19:35.242
Well done.

19:35.243 --> 19:36.777
Thank you, sir.

19:36.778 --> 19:40.080
In fact, the thing
that you failed to see, Captain,

19:40.081 --> 19:42.115
<i>teamwork, is exactly...</i>
Captain?

19:42.116 --> 19:44.117
<i>What provided our success.</i>
Sir?

19:44.118 --> 19:47.087
He's not coming back.

19:47.121 --> 19:50.123
<i>Boyle, I need you
in the briefing room.</i>

19:54.662 --> 19:57.264
<i>What is all this?</i>

19:57.298 --> 19:58.932
You know how I think
Halloween is for jerks?

19:58.933 --> 20:01.601
Well, this Halloween,
I was the jerk.

20:01.602 --> 20:03.336
I'm sorry about tonight.

20:03.337 --> 20:04.671
"I'm sorry about tonight."

20:04.672 --> 20:06.139
We found the title

20:06.140 --> 20:08.208
for Santiago's
follow-up sex tape.

20:08.209 --> 20:10.811
I'm sorry I couldn't convince
you to love Halloween.

20:10.845 --> 20:12.212
It's not your fault.
I was terrible.

20:12.213 --> 20:13.480
"It's not your fault
I was terrible"

20:13.481 --> 20:15.015
is also one
of your sex tapes.

20:15.016 --> 20:16.316
Ow.

20:16.317 --> 20:18.652
Halloween is unbearable.

20:18.653 --> 20:21.655
But it was slightly less
unbearable with you.

20:21.656 --> 20:22.989
Don't.
Okay.

20:22.990 --> 20:24.591
Anyway.

20:24.625 --> 20:27.160
We're all going to the bar,
so get changed,

20:27.161 --> 20:28.962
'cause you can't be
the only one there

20:28.963 --> 20:30.897
not wearing a 'stume.

20:30.898 --> 20:33.133
'Stume! Oh, my God.
It caught on.

20:33.167 --> 20:36.803
No.

20:36.838 --> 20:39.673
Ah, Captain Holt.
It is so nice to see you.

20:39.707 --> 20:41.174
Never thought I'd say that.
Hmm.

20:41.209 --> 20:43.310
A poor winner.
I never would've guessed.

20:43.344 --> 20:44.878
Yeah, you would've.

20:44.879 --> 20:46.346
Way to go all out
on your costume, by the way.

20:46.347 --> 20:48.448
I believe you have
an announcement to make,

20:48.483 --> 20:50.817
so the floor is yours.

20:50.818 --> 20:53.820
Attention, everyone.

20:53.821 --> 20:58.325
Jake Peralta is an amazing
Detective-slash-genius.

20:58.359 --> 21:00.393
<i>Now, if you'll excuse me,</i>

21:00.394 --> 21:03.530
I have some paperwork
to do.

21:03.531 --> 21:05.932
All right.

21:05.933 --> 21:08.401
Officer in the 92nd got
the royal baby mugger.

21:08.402 --> 21:09.936
He had 19 wallets
in his diaper.

21:09.937 --> 21:13.373
<i>We got a runner!</i>

21:13.374 --> 21:15.242
Waahhh!

21:15.276 --> 21:17.544
Damn!

21:17.545 --> 21:19.346
Oh, I didn't tell you.

21:19.347 --> 21:21.748
I got kicked out
of ballet school

21:21.749 --> 21:25.084
for beating the crap
out of ballerinas.
