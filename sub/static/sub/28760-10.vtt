00:01.700 --> 00:04.260
TERESA: Previously on
Queen of the South...

00:04.300 --> 00:06.689
Teresa Mendoza,
mi socia, Oksana Volkova.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.298
This is your girl, Raul?

00:15.040 --> 00:16.041
Salut.

00:16.810 --> 00:19.779
My man Cheo was arrested
two days ago in Ybor City.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.618
He's flipping on me--tossing
you in to sweeten the pot.

00:22.650 --> 00:24.311
TERESA:
I have Luz and your son.

00:24.350 --> 00:26.887
You can save them or spend
the rest of your life

00:26.920 --> 00:28.979
in witness protection knowing
that you killed them.

00:29.020 --> 00:30.624
El Gordo didn't mention a kid.

00:30.660 --> 00:31.979
HITMAN: He won't get
in the way.

00:32.030 --> 00:33.622
-And if he does?
-They can share a grave.

00:33.660 --> 00:35.890
-(gunfire)
-Get down!

00:35.930 --> 00:37.795
(bullets ricocheting)

00:37.830 --> 00:39.491
You're a hard man
to get a hold of.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.292
I was expecting
a call days ago.

00:41.340 --> 00:43.001
My sincerest apologies.

00:43.040 --> 00:44.507
The market's been
on a roller coaster.

00:44.540 --> 00:47.031
Dieter, is there a problem
with my money?

00:47.080 --> 00:49.742
Those orders won't affect you,
but they will tie up

00:49.780 --> 00:51.509
those funds temporarily.

00:51.550 --> 00:53.074
(both grunting)

00:53.120 --> 00:55.418
It was not his fault.
He didn't do it.

00:55.450 --> 00:57.315
-Who's he?
-My boyfriend.

00:57.350 --> 01:00.558
Your boyfriend happen to work
for Teresa Mendoza?

01:00.590 --> 01:02.319
I want you to come
live with me.

01:02.360 --> 01:04.282
Welcome home.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.360
Adios.

01:15.400 --> 01:16.731
(keypad beeps)

01:16.770 --> 01:21.070
Our contacts in Miami say
El Gordo's still in the wind.

01:21.110 --> 01:23.340
After he made a move
on you and Tony,

01:23.380 --> 01:25.177
he disappeared.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.575
We're gonna find him.

01:26.620 --> 01:30.078
Oksana has worked with
El Gordo for a long time.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.783
If we take him out,
we'll have a bigger problem.

01:35.820 --> 01:38.459
You once told me _
you have hitters In every City.

01:38.490 --> 01:41.891
Does that include Miami?

01:41.930 --> 01:44.797
You want me to make a move
on El Gordo.

01:44.830 --> 01:46.866
Yes.

01:46.900 --> 01:49.960
Consider it a business
opportunity.

01:50.010 --> 01:52.979
Oksana has the best molly
in the country.

01:53.010 --> 01:54.409
Do this,

01:54.440 --> 01:56.601
and I'll convince her
to supply you.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.277
(chuckles)

01:58.310 --> 02:00.710
(soft tense music)

02:00.750 --> 02:03.116
All right.
You do that.

02:03.150 --> 02:04.913
I'll get to El Gordo.

02:07.420 --> 02:09.388
I'll make him a memory.

02:09.430 --> 02:13.594
*

02:13.630 --> 02:16.167
State's budget cuts are killing
the other private prisons.

02:16.200 --> 02:19.590
Those budget cuts are
a momentary lapse of reason.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.666
I have the ear
of the State House.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.837
That may be so,
but we're talking about

02:24.870 --> 02:28.306
pulling up stakes
and moving to New Mexico.

02:28.340 --> 02:30.740
New Mexico?

02:30.780 --> 02:32.919
What is wrong with you?

02:32.950 --> 02:36.340
Louisiana is the prison capital
of the world.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.642
And just look where
the wind is blowing.

02:38.690 --> 02:41.454
Our correctional facilities
are overcrowded.

02:41.490 --> 02:43.958
Detention centers on the--
on the southern border

02:43.990 --> 02:46.754
are swarming with illegals.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.725
_And the overflow
IS coming our way.

02:53.300 --> 02:55.666
I may be able
to change their mind,

02:55.700 --> 02:57.429
but only if I can
assure my partners

02:57.470 --> 02:59.165
that we're ready
to break ground.

02:59.210 --> 03:02.270
How close are you to meeting
your fundraising goals?

03:02.310 --> 03:06.144
I convinced _a friend of mine
to Invest In the prOJect.

03:06.180 --> 03:08.819
She's got new money
burning a hole in her pocket.

03:10.690 --> 03:14.319
And I can be very persuasive.

03:15.420 --> 03:17.786
You deliver 30 million,

03:17.830 --> 03:19.183
and New Orleans
will have herself

03:19.230 --> 03:20.993
a new correctional facility.

03:21.030 --> 03:24.488
*

03:24.530 --> 03:26.066
(chuckles)

03:26.100 --> 03:30.503
*

03:30.540 --> 03:32.405
POTE: Look out through
both mirrors.

03:32.440 --> 03:33.702
-TERESA: Slow.
-POTE: Now turn the wheel.

03:33.740 --> 03:34.900
-TERESA: A little bit more.
-(exhales sharply)

03:34.940 --> 03:36.009
-POTE: Turn all the way.
-TERESA: That's it.

03:36.040 --> 03:38.008
-Slow.
-Slow.

03:38.050 --> 03:40.075
-POTE: All the way. Keep going.
-TERESA: Keep going.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.473
POTE: You're almost there.
Just keep going.

03:41.520 --> 03:43.010
Keep going.
Now stop.

03:43.050 --> 03:45.883
-TERESA: Now go forward.
-POTE: Now move forward slowly.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.684
TERESA: Slow.
A little bit more.

03:48.720 --> 03:51.382
POTE: There you go.

03:51.430 --> 03:53.990
-You did it.
-Yeah.

03:54.030 --> 03:55.895
-Put it in park.
-Okay.

03:55.930 --> 03:57.693
I'm gonna be back home
by 9:00, okay?

03:57.730 --> 03:59.197
Okay.

03:59.230 --> 04:02.529
Oh, I was thinking,
once I get my license,

04:02.570 --> 04:05.607
I could drive myself to school?

04:05.640 --> 04:07.699
School?

04:07.740 --> 04:09.742
I'm ready to go back.

04:09.780 --> 04:11.509
There's an art school here.

04:11.550 --> 04:13.017
It's called
the Young Artist's Colony.

04:13.050 --> 04:15.348
It's supposed to be one
of the best in the country.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.211
You want to study art?

04:17.250 --> 04:18.945
Well, yeah.
Is that dumb?

04:18.990 --> 04:21.618
No, it's great.
Let's look into it.

04:21.660 --> 04:22.729
Really?

04:22.760 --> 04:24.125
Yeah, of course.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.525
Let's talk about it later.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.425
Awesome.

04:27.460 --> 04:28.722
(smooches)
Bye.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.227
-See you later.
-Have a good day.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.464
You, too.

04:33.570 --> 04:35.037
All right, bye, Pote.

04:35.070 --> 04:36.606
Adios.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.776
TONY: See you later.

04:42.510 --> 04:45.479
He already missed
a lot of school.

04:45.510 --> 04:48.070
Those fancy private schools
don't need an excuse

04:48.120 --> 04:51.783
to say no to a kid like him.

04:51.820 --> 04:53.481
He's talented.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.524
He'll get in.

05:01.700 --> 05:04.396
(soft dramatic music)

05:04.430 --> 05:07.331
Patrona, the judge.

05:07.370 --> 05:14.378
*

05:17.310 --> 05:19.107
How's the tequila?

05:19.150 --> 05:21.516
It'll do--in a pinch.

05:21.550 --> 05:27.113
*

05:27.160 --> 05:29.481
Why are you here?

05:29.530 --> 05:32.158
I like how you cut
to the chase.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.096
There's a-- _
a pet prOJect of mIne

05:37.130 --> 05:40.099
that needs a influx of capital.

05:40.140 --> 05:44.031
I'm looking for
an advance on my 10%.

05:44.070 --> 05:46.300
How much of an advance?

05:46.340 --> 05:47.534
30 million.

05:47.580 --> 05:49.946
*

05:49.980 --> 05:51.607
I pay you enough already.

05:51.650 --> 05:53.140
(laughs)

05:53.180 --> 05:56.308
I do believe I've earned more--

05:56.350 --> 05:59.649
saved your hide from Marcel
and his Georgia boys.

05:59.690 --> 06:02.113
And I provided
valuable information

06:02.160 --> 06:04.151
about that turncoat Cheo.

06:04.190 --> 06:06.954
You'd have end up in federal
prison if it weren't for me.

06:07.000 --> 06:13.963
*

06:14.000 --> 06:17.834
I can always pay
that rat a visit.

06:17.870 --> 06:21.874
You're not the only one
who can squeeze his family.

06:21.910 --> 06:25.676
I'll make him sing
like a Cuban canary.

06:25.710 --> 06:27.746
Or,

06:27.780 --> 06:31.284
you can pay me in 72 hours.

06:33.390 --> 06:34.914
The choice is yours.

06:34.960 --> 06:41.957
*

06:57.610 --> 06:59.612
I need the money in 72 hours,
Dieter.

06:59.650 --> 07:02.881
Are we able _to access
the Turks and CaIcos accounts?

07:02.920 --> 07:05.684
It's going to be difficult to
liquidate on such short notice.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.381
If we try to pull out
that amount of money

07:07.420 --> 07:08.387
all at once,

07:08.420 --> 07:09.523
it's going to set off

07:09.560 --> 07:11.380
alarm bells at the TCB.

07:11.430 --> 07:12.385
I don't have time.

07:12.430 --> 07:14.227
This has to happen now.

07:14.260 --> 07:17.024
I can try and sell some of
your securities in Luxembourg,

07:17.070 --> 07:18.799
but the market
is considerably off.

07:18.830 --> 07:22.038
You're going to take
a significant hit.

07:22.070 --> 07:25.039
Do it.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.209
I'll let you know
when it's ready.

07:27.240 --> 07:28.468
(phone beeps)

07:28.510 --> 07:30.102
El Pinche Judge is not gonna

07:30.150 --> 07:31.447
put up with any delays

07:31.480 --> 07:32.617
on his 30 million.

07:32.650 --> 07:33.617
If this cabrn

07:33.650 --> 07:34.617
makes us wait again--

07:34.650 --> 07:37.312
I know.
Yes?

07:37.350 --> 07:38.544
I drew up power of attorney.

07:38.590 --> 07:39.614
I just need a signature

07:39.660 --> 07:40.718
and I'll be able to put

07:40.760 --> 07:42.580
together that trust for Tony.

07:45.030 --> 07:46.918
If I'm out of line just say so,

07:46.960 --> 07:48.723
but TCB is the bank Cole used

07:48.760 --> 07:49.966
to use for all of his clients.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.059
I mean, I did most
of the legwork.

07:52.100 --> 07:53.067
The manager and I

07:53.100 --> 07:55.432
were on a first-name basis.

07:55.470 --> 07:56.937
I could help you.

07:56.970 --> 07:57.937
I could at least look into it

07:57.970 --> 07:58.937
and make sure nothing's

07:58.970 --> 08:01.677
holding up your money.

08:01.710 --> 08:03.268
Please look into it.

08:05.180 --> 08:06.272
Thank you.

08:11.220 --> 08:12.881
We need to go.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.596
Why is Raul's rat
still breathing?

08:22.630 --> 08:24.689
TERESA: He's not a threat
anymore.

08:24.730 --> 08:27.494
-He won't talk to the feds.
-You can't be sure of that.

08:27.540 --> 08:29.030
Raul sent a hitman

08:29.070 --> 08:30.867
who wanted to blow up a woman,

08:30.910 --> 08:31.865
her child,

08:31.910 --> 08:33.969
and half a dozen US. Marshals.

08:34.010 --> 08:35.500
IfI had let that happen,

08:35.540 --> 08:37.269
you and I would be in prison

08:37.310 --> 08:38.675
or on the run by now.

08:38.710 --> 08:39.870
Because I stopped him,

08:39.920 --> 08:42.013
he tried to kill me
and my godson.

08:43.920 --> 08:47.481
Teresa, I'm--I'm so sorry.
I did not know that.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.523
And I do not
condone his actions.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.219
Iassume _
you're lookIng for hIm now?

08:57.830 --> 08:59.991
I'm gonna kill him.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.292
I understand your anger,

09:02.340 --> 09:06.128
but I think it is best
to let things calm down.

09:06.170 --> 09:09.640
How can you trust Raul
or anyone in his business

09:09.680 --> 09:10.999
after all of this?

09:11.050 --> 09:14.838
Because I have known
the man for years.

09:14.880 --> 09:18.748
Teresa, you and I have made
a lot of money with him.

09:18.790 --> 09:21.156
Scorched earth
won't fill our pockets.

09:21.190 --> 09:23.351
And give him another chance
to kill me?

09:23.390 --> 09:27.554
You found a bloodless solution
to the Cheo problem.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.864
I'm sure we can do
the same for Raul.

09:29.900 --> 09:32.767
(tense music)

09:32.800 --> 09:37.305
IfI bring him to the table,
would you be open to a meeting?

09:39.210 --> 09:41.371
You're asking a lot.

09:41.410 --> 09:44.538
I will guarantee your safety.

09:44.580 --> 09:47.048
But Raul would expect me
to do the same for him.

09:47.080 --> 09:51.346
The meeting would be
in your city on your turf.

09:51.390 --> 09:54.086
It's Raul and I
who are taking risk.

09:55.590 --> 09:57.854
If you can find him,

09:57.890 --> 09:59.426
I'll meet.

10:01.430 --> 10:04.797
Very good, then.
I will be in touch.

10:04.830 --> 10:11.838
*

10:15.640 --> 10:17.779
Patrona,
she's gonna set you up.

10:17.810 --> 10:19.072
Then we hit him there.

10:19.110 --> 10:21.419
No.

10:21.450 --> 10:23.384
I think she wants
to keep the peace.

10:23.420 --> 10:25.718
If we're gonna take out
El Gordo,

10:25.750 --> 10:28.310
we need Oksana to agree to it.

10:28.360 --> 10:35.357
*

10:47.540 --> 10:49.337
Hey, we have a problem.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.745
Dieter's been stealing
from you, Teresa.

10:52.780 --> 10:55.112
All of your money's gone.

10:55.150 --> 10:57.414
-What do you mean, gone?
-Come here.

10:57.450 --> 10:59.611
Dieter's been sending you
fake bank statements,

10:59.650 --> 11:02.016
so I had the bank
e-mail over the real ones.

11:02.060 --> 11:03.925
Look,
you see here your balance,

11:03.960 --> 11:05.621
how it fluctuates
from month to month

11:05.660 --> 11:07.753
from absolutely nothing
and then back up again?

11:07.800 --> 11:09.768
-It's a Ponzi scheme.
-Exactly.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.199
He's been stealing money
from you

11:11.230 --> 11:13.164
and then eventually
he replaces it with money

11:13.200 --> 11:14.929
from his other clients.

11:14.970 --> 11:17.336
POTE: The people that
he cleans the money for.

11:17.370 --> 11:20.533
He's a dead man walking.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.434
He's betting they will
be in jail or dead

11:22.480 --> 11:24.539
by the time they catch on.

11:24.580 --> 11:26.946
Do you want me to get on
a plane now, patrona?

11:26.980 --> 11:28.470
No.

11:28.520 --> 11:31.216
If he thinks we're on to him,
he'll disappear.

11:31.250 --> 11:35.289
*

11:35.320 --> 11:37.686
I'm gonna need your help.

11:37.730 --> 11:39.891
Anything.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.889
(cell phone vibrating)

11:46.500 --> 11:48.229
(cell phone beeps)

11:48.270 --> 11:50.158
Hola, compadre.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.802
I hear you've been
looking for me.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.899
I'm glad we can finally meet.

11:53.940 --> 11:55.976
Yeah, maybe we can make that
happen in person.

11:56.010 --> 11:58.672
No need when
we have technology.

11:58.710 --> 12:00.246
I never got the chance
to pay you back

12:00.280 --> 12:02.077
for kidnapping my nephew.

12:02.120 --> 12:05.089
*

12:05.120 --> 12:08.487
Your nephew came back
in one piece, as I recall.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.249
What can I say?

12:10.290 --> 12:13.327
You make a habit of learning
from other people's mistakes.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.419
*

12:20.870 --> 12:23.737
Now that was a nice first
meetIng, wouldn't you say?

12:23.770 --> 12:25.931
Know this, Gordo.

12:25.970 --> 12:28.336
You step one foot in my city,

12:28.380 --> 12:31.599
and you'll be dancing at the
bottom of the Mississippi.

12:31.650 --> 12:34.448
Oh, yeah?
Guess what?

12:34.480 --> 12:36.414
I'm already here.

12:36.450 --> 12:38.008
Not you, not Teresa,

12:38.050 --> 12:40.848
not any maldito river
can take me down.

12:40.890 --> 12:43.723
Entiendes?
Hm?

12:43.760 --> 12:45.057
-Hasta luego.
-(phone beeps)

12:45.090 --> 12:46.990
(exhales sharply)

12:49.100 --> 12:51.068
-(grunts)
-(phone clattering)

13:03.380 --> 13:05.541
I sold some
of their securities.

13:05.580 --> 13:07.969
I can wire you
the money tonight.

13:08.020 --> 13:10.181
TERESA: That's great.
Thank you.

13:12.090 --> 13:13.751
Is there something else?

13:13.790 --> 13:16.384
Do you know the name
Cole Van Awken?

13:16.420 --> 13:18.251
DIETER: The lawyer
from Dallas?

13:18.290 --> 13:20.827
I've heard of him.
Didn't he go missing?

13:20.860 --> 13:22.828
He's presumed dead.

13:22.870 --> 13:25.259
His widow, Kelly Anne,
is a friend of mine

13:25.300 --> 13:27.063
and she has a problem--

13:27.100 --> 13:29.568
a large sum of money that
could bring too much attention.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.899
She was a person of interest
in his disappearance.

13:32.940 --> 13:34.407
DIETER: I see.

13:34.440 --> 13:36.579
That's why she couldn't
access the money,

13:36.610 --> 13:39.477
and now she needs _someone
With your experience

13:39.510 --> 13:41.410
and discretion.

13:41.450 --> 13:42.917
DIETER: If she's
Van Awken's widow,

13:42.950 --> 13:47.410
I imagine her problem
is rather...sizable.

13:47.460 --> 13:50.827
TERESA: It's nine figures.

13:50.860 --> 13:52.680
She's in New Orleans now.

13:52.730 --> 13:55.119
If you would like,
I can make an introduction

13:55.160 --> 13:56.821
and you can bring
my money in person.

13:56.870 --> 13:59.691
I have a flight tonight
to Europe.

13:59.730 --> 14:04.099
But I suppose
I can make a stop.

14:04.140 --> 14:07.029
Great.
I'll let her know.

14:12.050 --> 14:14.439
Are you sure about this?

14:14.480 --> 14:15.970
Yes.

14:24.760 --> 14:26.557
Kelly Anne,

14:26.590 --> 14:29.354
you know this is dangerous.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.459
I know.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.161
She needs me.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.964
(soft dramatic music)

14:36.000 --> 14:39.003
I'm either in this family
or I'm not.

14:41.880 --> 14:48.069
*

14:48.120 --> 14:49.473
TONY: There are a lot
of talented kids

14:49.520 --> 14:51.249
going to the Artist Colony.

14:51.290 --> 14:52.917
TERESA: They're really good.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.359
TONY: Yeah.

14:54.390 --> 14:56.415
There's a senior art show
at the school rIght now.

14:56.460 --> 14:57.927
(computer mouse clicking)

14:57.960 --> 14:59.928
I mean, look at these.

14:59.960 --> 15:02.394
They're amazing.

15:02.430 --> 15:03.897
All the detail...

15:05.800 --> 15:07.939
I wonder if I can ever be
that good, you know?

15:10.470 --> 15:13.769
This is a really hard school
to get into.

15:13.810 --> 15:16.108
My grades aren't that great.

15:16.140 --> 15:17.698
And that's if they'll
even like my drawings.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.877
You're talented.

15:19.910 --> 15:21.377
They'd be lucky to have you.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.389
*

15:24.420 --> 15:25.887
You really think I have a shot?

15:25.920 --> 15:28.115
Yes.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.559
I believe in you.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.024
Okay.
I'm gonna apply.

15:34.060 --> 15:36.620
(cell phone vibrates)

15:36.660 --> 15:38.298
I have to take this.

15:38.330 --> 15:40.434
You should go home.
Chicho will take you.

15:40.470 --> 15:41.698
Okay.

15:41.740 --> 15:43.139
All right,
see you later.

15:43.170 --> 15:45.604
See you.
Chicho.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.029
Take Tony home, okay?

15:48.080 --> 15:51.106
Gracias.

15:51.150 --> 15:53.038
-(door closes)
-(phone beeps)

15:53.080 --> 15:54.741
Yes?

15:54.780 --> 15:56.543
OKSANA: I have made contact
with El Gordo.

15:56.580 --> 15:59.219
Good news.
He's willing to meet.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.649
Just the three of us.

16:00.690 --> 16:02.419
-I don't trust him.
-(laughs softly)

16:02.460 --> 16:04.553
We're here to iron out
the differences,

16:04.590 --> 16:06.057
not create new ones.

16:06.090 --> 16:09.958
I understand,
but I still don't like it.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.560
I'll do one better.

16:12.600 --> 16:15.467
As a show of good faith,
El Gordo and I would like

16:15.500 --> 16:19.163
to double our normal order
of this month's shipment.

16:21.280 --> 16:24.841
_ I assume that
Isn't a problem?

16:24.880 --> 16:27.747
It's not.
I'll send it.

16:27.780 --> 16:29.338
Excellent.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.587
I will be in touch
with more details.

16:31.620 --> 16:33.759
(foreboding music)

16:33.790 --> 16:35.257
(cell phone beeps)

16:35.290 --> 16:39.454
So our little United Nations
meeting IS set.

16:39.490 --> 16:43.165
I never thought Mexico should
have a seat at the table.

16:43.200 --> 16:46.169
Raul,

16:46.200 --> 16:50.534
I promised Teresa that
she would be safe here.

16:50.570 --> 16:54.108
If you have other intentions,
I will cancel this sit-down.

16:54.140 --> 16:58.600
I will not be
in the middle of war.

16:58.650 --> 17:00.311
All of our problems started

17:00.350 --> 17:02.511
when we got into business
with Teresa.

17:02.550 --> 17:06.008
And all of our new money!

17:06.050 --> 17:08.553
Wouldn't you rather
get back to business?

17:08.590 --> 17:11.559
(soft dramatic music)

17:11.590 --> 17:12.682
*

17:12.730 --> 17:15.790
Look, Teresa did not hire Cheo.

17:15.830 --> 17:18.390
The rat was in your house.

17:18.430 --> 17:20.796
He threw all of our operations
into disarray,

17:20.840 --> 17:23.434
and none more than yours, Raul.

17:25.540 --> 17:28.202
Now, she may not have
dealt with the Cheo problem

17:28.240 --> 17:31.141
the way you wanted,
but it's been handled.

17:31.180 --> 17:37.085
*

17:37.120 --> 17:38.849
Raul, look at me.

17:41.460 --> 17:45.157
I need you to play nice here.

17:45.190 --> 17:48.159
What we want is peace.

17:48.200 --> 17:55.197
*

17:56.370 --> 17:59.430
If she's open to a truce,

17:59.470 --> 18:02.177
I suppose I can find
my way there as well.

18:02.210 --> 18:09.218
*

18:27.400 --> 18:29.766
I can't believe you're giving
Mendoza a pass, to.

18:29.800 --> 18:32.268
That's for la Rusa's benefit.

18:32.310 --> 18:36.701
I still have every intention
of taking out flaca.

18:36.740 --> 18:39.709
Yeah, but aren't you
gonna piss off Oksana?

18:39.750 --> 18:41.377
(sighs)

18:41.420 --> 18:44.139
She may think she's in love
with Teresa right now,

18:44.190 --> 18:45.782
but Oksana will come
to her senses

18:45.820 --> 18:49.586
and agree to putting Mendoza
in the ground.

18:49.620 --> 18:51.884
-And if she doesn't...
-(elevator dings)

18:51.930 --> 18:53.352
She can die, too.

19:01.870 --> 19:03.804
-How's it going?
-Good.

19:03.840 --> 19:06.809
Your new offshore bank account
IS open and ready for busmess.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.398
POTE: Dieter's almost here.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.340
Let's go over the plan
one more time.

19:10.380 --> 19:11.608
Javier?

19:11.650 --> 19:13.948
Dieter travels
with four body guards.

19:13.980 --> 19:16.744
Two will enter the _club
to keep eyes on hIm.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.680
And two will stay outside
near the car,

19:18.720 --> 19:19.948
where our money will be.

19:19.990 --> 19:21.252
POTE: After a few drinks,

19:21.290 --> 19:24.259
you bring him here to the
office for a private chat.

19:24.290 --> 19:26.121
Javier will distract
one of the bodyguards

19:26.160 --> 19:27.627
and I will disarm
the other one.

19:27.660 --> 19:29.753
With a gun to his head,
we make him transfer the money

19:29.800 --> 19:31.461
to the new
offshore bank account.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.695
Once that's done,
he'll instruct his men

19:33.740 --> 19:35.628
to bring the 30 million
into the bar.

19:35.670 --> 19:37.535
We get the money.
He gets his life.

19:37.570 --> 19:39.663
We pay the judge.
Our business is done.

19:39.710 --> 19:41.678
Easy-peasy.
(chuckles)

19:44.380 --> 19:45.938
-You good?
-Yeah, yeah.

19:45.980 --> 19:48.517
-I'm ready.
-Let's do this.

19:53.420 --> 19:56.389
(upbeat dance music playing)

19:56.420 --> 20:03.428
*

20:04.530 --> 20:07.533
(indistinct chatter)

20:17.610 --> 20:20.170
There he is.

20:20.210 --> 20:22.417
Hey, mira.

20:22.450 --> 20:25.817
(tense music)

20:25.850 --> 20:27.909
That's more muscle
than we expected.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.178
Check the car outside.

20:30.220 --> 20:31.926
TERESA: Dieter,
glad you could make it.

20:31.960 --> 20:34.497
What an absolutely
beautiful venue.

20:34.530 --> 20:36.828
Thank you.
This way.

20:36.860 --> 20:39.021
*

20:39.070 --> 20:41.994
Kelly Anne,
please meet Dieter Fassler.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.964
-It's a pleasure.
-Pleasure's entirely mine.

20:46.640 --> 20:49.006
Teresa forgot to mention
your stunning beauty.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.439
(chuckles)
Oh, he's a charmer.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.845
I'm gonna have to keep
my eye on him.

20:51.880 --> 20:54.542
(both laughing)

20:54.580 --> 20:58.448
*

20:58.490 --> 21:02.017
So, tell me how
I can be of service.

21:02.060 --> 21:04.722
Well,
after my husband disappeared,

21:04.760 --> 21:08.025
I got a phone call from
the Montclair Hotel in Vegas

21:08.060 --> 21:10.927
asking if I wanted to come
claim the contents

21:10.970 --> 21:13.029
of my husband's safe,
but obviously,

21:13.070 --> 21:16.233
I couldn't just go to Vegas
given the circumstances

21:16.270 --> 21:18.738
'cause it_ would have seemed
a lIttle SUSplCIOUS.

21:18.770 --> 21:20.874
DIETER: So you waited
until things cooled off.

21:20.910 --> 21:22.275
Exactly.

21:22.310 --> 21:23.800
So I finally
make it down to Vegas

21:23.850 --> 21:25.374
thinking I'm gonna see
a whole bunch

21:25.410 --> 21:28.243
of some other woman's
unmentlonables and Instead--

21:28.280 --> 21:29.872
It's money.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.388
It's $100 million.

21:32.420 --> 21:33.978
She needs to get
her money cleaned.

21:34.020 --> 21:35.817
And out of reach
of the authorities

21:35.860 --> 21:38.158
who may still be looking
into your husband's,

21:38.190 --> 21:41.250
shall we say,
illicit business dealings?

21:41.300 --> 21:46.897
*

21:46.930 --> 21:49.467
He has four more
bodyguards outside.

21:49.500 --> 21:52.560
Est_e cabrn
came With an army.

21:52.610 --> 21:56.068
Going past the four guys
in here's gonna be tough.

21:56.110 --> 21:58.670
One wrong move, and we have
a bloodbath in the bar.

21:58.710 --> 22:00.575
If the money's in the car,

22:00.620 --> 22:02.941
maybe we should just
steal the car, eh?

22:05.120 --> 22:06.417
Which car?

22:06.450 --> 22:08.281
There are three SUVs
parked outSIde.

22:08.320 --> 22:10.925
*

22:10.960 --> 22:13.019
What is he planning?

22:14.630 --> 22:18.293
When Teresa told me she had a
guy who might be able to help,

22:18.330 --> 22:20.298
you know,
someone who knows how to

22:20.330 --> 22:22.798
deal with people on the fringe,

22:22.840 --> 22:25.308
I just prayed
you'd be my answer.

22:25.340 --> 22:28.798
I'd like to be your
answered prayer.

22:28.840 --> 22:31.502
But I must inform you that
transactions like this

22:31.550 --> 22:33.939
can be very complicated.

22:33.980 --> 22:36.346
Mmm.

22:36.380 --> 22:38.940
I don't care how much it costs.

22:38.990 --> 22:41.652
I need it done.

22:41.690 --> 22:45.057
Champagne?

22:45.090 --> 22:46.648
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

22:46.690 --> 22:48.396
-TERESA: Cheers.
-(chuckles)

22:48.430 --> 22:51.558
*

22:51.600 --> 22:53.898
(cell phone vibrates)

22:53.940 --> 22:56.329
Mmm, excuse me for one moment.

22:56.370 --> 22:57.962
-Mm-hmm.
-Mmm.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.329
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

22:59.370 --> 23:02.339
(chuckles)

23:02.380 --> 23:04.075
I'm intrigued
with the possibility

23:04.110 --> 23:05.907
of working with you.

23:05.950 --> 23:08.976
But I'm not a man who believes
in one night stands,

23:09.020 --> 23:10.578
Ol‘ one-off transactions.

23:10.620 --> 23:12.485
Oh, honey, neither do I.

23:12.520 --> 23:14.158
To be honest,
I wanted to meet you

23:14.190 --> 23:15.555
and make sure
I feel comfortable.

23:15.590 --> 23:16.989
Mm-hmm.

23:17.020 --> 23:18.556
But now that I feel
a little more comfortable,

23:18.590 --> 23:21.491
I think I can tell you
there's a lot more.

23:21.530 --> 23:24.363
Millions spread across
several hotels

23:24.400 --> 23:27.858
just waiting
to be claimed and cleaned.

23:27.900 --> 23:29.595
-Interesting.
-Mm-hmm.

23:29.640 --> 23:32.404
Which hotels?

23:32.440 --> 23:35.568
-Um, the Sanford in Houston.
-Mm-hmm.

23:35.610 --> 23:39.569
-The, um--the June in Chicago.
-The June in Chicago.

23:39.610 --> 23:41.009
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm.

23:41.050 --> 23:42.517
Yes?

23:42.550 --> 23:45.280
DUMAS: El Gordo's in town
and he's coming for you.

23:45.320 --> 23:46.514
He called me.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.108
The men I sent
to hunt him down--

23:48.160 --> 23:50.879
he had me watch
while he slaughtered them.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.784
*

23:52.830 --> 23:54.195
I'm sorry, Marcel.

23:54.230 --> 23:57.119
This is a courtesy call.

23:57.160 --> 24:00.129
-(guns cocking)
-DUMAS: The gloves are off.

24:00.170 --> 24:02.195
I'm gonna hit Oksana
and anyone else

24:02.240 --> 24:05.437
connected to him until
I get my pound of flesh.

24:05.470 --> 24:08.132
Something's not right.

24:08.180 --> 24:10.603
I will get Oksana on our side.

24:10.650 --> 24:13.141
I just need time.

24:13.180 --> 24:14.716
You got 24 hours.

24:14.750 --> 24:21.713
*

24:21.760 --> 24:24.058
Sorry about that.

24:24.090 --> 24:25.921
It's getting quite noisy
out here.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.222
Should we move to my office?

24:27.260 --> 24:30.423
Yeah, someplace more intimate
so we can finalize the deal.

24:30.460 --> 24:32.269
I have a better idea.

24:32.300 --> 24:34.962
I rented a home
on the St. Charles.

24:35.000 --> 24:36.934
It's an absolute wonder
to behold.

24:36.970 --> 24:38.301
That's where I have your money.

24:40.110 --> 24:42.169
I know I was supposed
to bring it here,

24:42.210 --> 24:43.643
but I didn't wanna
tempt the gods

24:43.680 --> 24:45.978
by carrying
30 million in cash

24:46.010 --> 24:49.275
down the streets
of New Orleans.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.787
Of course.

24:50.820 --> 24:53.084
Mmm?

24:53.120 --> 24:54.485
-Shall we?
-Sure.

24:54.520 --> 24:55.509
All right.

24:58.060 --> 24:59.755
KELLY ANNE: Mm, thank you.

24:59.790 --> 25:01.098
Where are they going?

25:01.130 --> 25:03.792
I don't know,
but our plan just blew up.

25:03.830 --> 25:06.264
Let's go.

25:06.300 --> 25:13.308
*

25:17.810 --> 25:20.813
(car doors opening, closing)

25:22.580 --> 25:25.117
We're going to his house.
Follow us.

25:25.150 --> 25:32.158

25:35.830 --> 25:37.422

26:11.030 --> 26:12.668
He's got security,
but he's just a banker.

26:12.700 --> 26:15.168
A dirty banker.

26:15.200 --> 26:18.738
Maybe he thinks that Teresa
and Kelly Anne are on to him.

26:18.770 --> 26:22.536
Who knows what he's capable of?

26:22.580 --> 26:24.377
Silencers on.

26:28.780 --> 26:31.749
(soft tense music)

26:31.790 --> 26:38.787
*

26:40.730 --> 26:42.459
Oh, it's so beautiful out here.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.365
And private.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.595
Just wait until
you see the house.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.764
(chuckles)

26:49.800 --> 26:56.808

you weren't kidding.

27:23.340 --> 27:25.137

Wait till you see the inside.

Gracias.

28:35.210 --> 28:37.974

-Wow.

28:40.710 --> 28:42.974
_ KELLY_ANNE:
This place is so classy.

28:43.020 --> 28:45.318
You know what you should do is
you should add a little

28:45.350 --> 28:47.910
cow skin rug and maybe
some horns up on the mantle--

28:47.960 --> 28:49.712
really liven up the joint.

28:51.930 --> 28:53.522
That's a great suggestion.

28:53.560 --> 28:55.528
Oh.
(chuckles)

28:55.560 --> 29:00.327
*

29:00.370 --> 29:02.031

I took the liberty to

29:02.070 --> 29:04.436
open the bottle earlier
to let it breathe.

29:04.470 --> 29:08.008
KELLY ANNE:
Ah, Le Mu5igny 2005.

-Oh. (chuckles)

Excuse me, it's my godson.
I need to make a phone call.

Sure.

-Tony, is everything okay?

29:25.490 --> 29:27.128
No, no, no, no, no, yeah.

29:27.160 --> 29:28.957
Um, it's just that

closes tomorrow night,

29:31.400 --> 29:33.618

I know, I'm sorry,

29:35.400 --> 29:38.369
but space is limited.

29:38.410 --> 29:41.038
Can we go?
Please?

29:41.080 --> 29:43.230
I have a meeting
tomorrow night.

29:43.280 --> 29:45.077
TONY: Look, all the faculty
will be there,

29:45.110 --> 29:48.375
and I know how good you are at
convincing people to do stuff.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.376
I'll see what I can do.

29:50.420 --> 29:51.546
It's fortunate your husband

29:51.590 --> 29:53.319
made sure
you were taken care of.

29:53.350 --> 29:54.453
It is, yeah.

29:54.490 --> 29:56.151
Finding that money was
a real blessing.

29:56.190 --> 29:59.557
Mmm.

29:59.590 --> 30:00.784
Just in time.

30:00.830 --> 30:03.048
We were just discussing
Miss Van Awken's estate.

30:03.100 --> 30:04.795
I'm glad
you finally found someone

30:04.830 --> 30:06.764
who can take care
of her money Situation.

30:06.800 --> 30:08.665
Yes, well, unfortunately,

30:08.700 --> 30:11.567
I don't think
I can help her after all.

30:11.610 --> 30:12.838
Why?

30:12.870 --> 30:17.807
Because I don't believe
there is any money.

30:17.850 --> 30:20.273
What are you talking about?

30:20.310 --> 30:22.972
Miss Van Awken mentioned that
she had additional money

30:23.020 --> 30:24.783
in other hotels.

30:24.820 --> 30:28.085
-So what's the problem?
-Problem is she's lying.

in your husband's
disappearance, right?

31:02.420 --> 31:03.956
Yes, I told you that
on the phone.

31:03.990 --> 31:05.821
Yeah, they always
question the spouse.

31:05.860 --> 31:09.455
And you reached out to Teresa
to launder an ungodly amount

31:09.500 --> 31:12.958
of money without bothering
to ask for my rate?

31:13.000 --> 31:15.366
TERESA: Because I told her
about our rate.

31:15.400 --> 31:16.833
She expected the same.

31:16.870 --> 31:18.667
Yeah, I'm sorry.

Okay, fine.
I didn't go to rehab.

31:44.030 --> 31:45.998
After Cole disappeared,
I went on a bender

31:46.030 --> 31:48.169
because I wanted to forget.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.895
I don't believe you.

I think you were arrested
for Cole's murder

31:53.940 --> 31:57.171

and to save yourself.

Nobody.

32:01.550 --> 32:04.713
Teresa,
do you really trust this woman?

32:04.750 --> 32:07.514
Do you know for a fact where
she was when she disappeared?

32:07.550 --> 32:10.519
And who she was talking to?

32:10.560 --> 32:12.528
She showed up out of the blue,

32:12.560 --> 32:14.721
_ eased herself
into your confidence,

32:14.760 --> 32:16.694

35:49.640 --> 35:56.648
*

36:04.730 --> 36:06.322
(cell phone beeps)

36:06.360 --> 36:10.626
OKSANA: Teresa, I just had
a moment of pray for us.

36:10.660 --> 36:12.821
TERESA:
What were you praying for?

36:12.870 --> 36:14.838
Peace.

36:14.870 --> 36:17.031
TERESA: There is no peace.

36:17.070 --> 36:19.129
Be careful.

36:19.170 --> 36:20.967
Think about what you're saying.

36:21.010 --> 36:23.274
You have to make your choice.

36:23.310 --> 36:25.642
I'm gonna kill El Gordo.

36:25.680 --> 36:28.649
(foreboding music)

36:28.680 --> 36:32.138
*

36:32.190 --> 36:33.487
(phone beeps)

36:33.520 --> 36:40.528
*

36:47.500 --> 36:48.967
Our operation here is small.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.865
We take out her
and that morenito

36:55.040 --> 36:56.974
We'll need her
Colombian supplier.

36:57.010 --> 36:58.671
Mmm, that's not an issue.

36:58.710 --> 37:00.746
I have contacts
all over Colombia.

37:00.780 --> 37:04.238
It's gonna feel so good
taking her business.

37:04.290 --> 37:06.019
You wanted this all along.

37:06.050 --> 37:08.985
It's the smart play.

37:09.020 --> 37:11.887
You chose correctly,
mi socia.

37:11.930 --> 37:13.727
(quiet gunfire, thuds)

37:13.760 --> 37:16.422
You're half right.

37:16.460 --> 37:19.896
(tense music)

37:19.930 --> 37:22.535
-TERESA: Raul.
-Telephone tough guy.

37:22.570 --> 37:24.401
Remember me?

37:24.440 --> 37:27.034
Now I told you what would
happen if you set foot

37:27.070 --> 37:29.038
in my city.

37:36.050 --> 37:39.213
I tried to help you, Raul.

37:39.250 --> 37:41.787
But Teresa showed you
for what you are...

37:43.890 --> 37:46.154
A liability.

37:49.660 --> 37:52.959
What have you done, Oksana?

37:53.000 --> 37:54.433
You side with this trash
over me?

37:54.470 --> 37:55.767
-(quiet gunshot)
-(grunts)

37:58.310 --> 38:01.632
(soft dramatic music)

38:01.680 --> 38:08.677
*

38:27.830 --> 38:34.838
*

38:44.020 --> 38:46.409
Give Miss Mendoza my best.

38:46.450 --> 38:53.458
*

38:58.060 --> 39:00.620
(door opens)

39:00.670 --> 39:02.160
(door closes)

39:17.980 --> 39:21.609
(crickets chirping)

39:21.660 --> 39:25.448
Oksana made peace
with Shomari in Atlanta?

39:25.490 --> 39:29.199
Yeah, and Dumas will
be distributing her molly.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.388
-KELLY ANNE: Hey.
-Hey.

39:32.430 --> 39:34.318
Tony's trust.

39:34.370 --> 39:35.564
Thank you.

39:37.500 --> 39:39.058
-Hey.
-Hey.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.964
You ready to go to the
art school exhibit?

39:41.010 --> 39:42.637
TONY: Yeah.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.238
You can show them
your drawmgs.

39:44.280 --> 39:46.145
I won't show them
the super Violent ones.

39:46.180 --> 39:48.569
Good.
We should get going.

39:52.590 --> 39:55.354
-TERESA: Gracias.
-I'm driving?

39:55.390 --> 39:58.018
Why not?
It's your car.

40:03.030 --> 40:05.999
The Range Rover?
(laughs softly)

40:06.030 --> 40:08.567
How are you gonna
get to school?

40:08.600 --> 40:11.398
Thank you so much, Teresa.

40:11.440 --> 40:12.907
It's out front.

40:12.940 --> 40:15.909
(gentle music)

40:15.940 --> 40:19.899
*

40:19.950 --> 40:23.374
If he doesn't get into
the school with his grades,

40:23.420 --> 40:26.014
we can always buy a building

40:26.050 --> 40:28.587
like all those
rich white parents do.

40:28.620 --> 40:30.679
(both chuckling)

40:30.720 --> 40:32.950
He'll get in on his own.

40:32.990 --> 40:39.919
*

40:51.010 --> 40:52.546
(seatbelt buckles)

40:52.580 --> 40:59.588
*

41:02.090 --> 41:03.955
-(car engine struggling)
-(device beeps)

41:05.960 --> 41:07.086
Tony!

41:08.160 --> 41:12.028
(ominous music)

41:29.550 --> 41:30.517
(projector clicking)

41:30.550 --> 41:33.519
(keys clacking, bell dings)
