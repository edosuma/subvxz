WEBVTT

01:03.840 --> 01:05.819
Where is he, Jeremy?

01:06.920 --> 01:09.184
Papa's been gone a long while, hasn't he?

01:10.880 --> 01:12.859
Where can he be, sweetheart?

01:14.280 --> 01:16.259
Where can he be?

01:37.960 --> 01:39.939
(Woman calls out in French)

01:45.560 --> 01:47.141
(Grunts)

01:50.080 --> 01:51.263
Tiens!

01:51.440 --> 01:53.101
(Shouting in French)

01:53.280 --> 01:56.226
- Je suis innocent!
- Allez par lCl!

01:56.400 --> 01:57.947
(Man shrieks)

01:58.120 --> 02:00.099
- Je suis innocent!
THOLLY: Come on.

02:03.120 --> 02:04.508
(Low chatter)

02:10.000 --> 02:11.945
DEMELZ4:
He 7/ be game in
few days.

02:12.680 --> 02:17.105
I pray for his return and dread it...
for while there's no news of Dwight...

02:17.280 --> 02:18.702
There's still hope.

02:18.880 --> 02:22.862
Yes, that he is still alive somewhere in France.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.399
I couldn't bear for Ross to risk his life for nothing.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.460
Doctor Enys be alive.
Old Prudie feel it in her bones.

02:31.640 --> 02:34.700
Don't you worry about Ross.
He knows how to take care of himself.

02:34.880 --> 02:37.747
In any case, 'tis only Roscoff.

02:41.680 --> 02:44.137
Je ne suis pas un espion! Je le jure!

02:44.320 --> 02:46.697
- (Grunts)
- Menteur!

02:48.200 --> 02:49.269
(Grunts)

02:49.440 --> 02:53.422
- "Quaint little market town"?
- So 'twas, young Cap'n,

02:53.600 --> 02:56.307
when your father and I used to make the trip.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.506
That was 20 years ago, before the Revolution.

03:01.680 --> 03:04.660
- Let's hope that's not our man.
- Nay.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.344
Jacques Clisson be a wily old cove.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.977
He be laying low till the coast's clear.

03:10.160 --> 03:13.539
- Whenever that may be.
- Directly, I swear.

03:15.040 --> 03:18.020
Old Tholly ever let you down before? Hm?

03:25.360 --> 03:27.021
Qu’ est-me que ’m regardes’?

03:27.200 --> 03:29.509
Fils de chien.

03:29.680 --> 03:31.659
(Bell tolls)

03:36.000 --> 03:37.979
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

03:39.520 --> 03:41.420
These people, you know them?

03:41.600 --> 03:43.818
Of course, they're our tenants.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.697
Francis always felt it was important
to be on good terms with them.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.260
But, then, he'd grown up in the district.

03:50.440 --> 03:53.386
- With an ancient family name.
- And no fences?

03:53.560 --> 03:55.937
Reverend Odgers,
the west gate needs repairing.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.781
Would you send the bill to my steward?

03:57.960 --> 04:00.224
Most generous of you, sir.
We're unspeakably grateful.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.857
..to the gospel feast

04:03.040 --> 04:07.227
Let every soul be Jesus' guest

04:07.400 --> 04:10.904
Ye need not one be left behind

04:11.080 --> 04:15.267
For God hath bid all humankind

04:16.240 --> 04:20.301
Sent by my Lord, on you I call

04:20.480 --> 04:24.109
The invitation is to all

04:24.280 --> 04:26.020
Come, all the world

04:26.200 --> 04:28.020
Come, sinner, thou

04:28.200 --> 04:31.419
All things in Christ are ready now

04:32.600 --> 04:34.181
Laissez-moi, monsieur!

04:34.360 --> 04:36.920
WOMAN: Monsieur! Monsieur!
- (Guard speaks French)

04:37.080 --> 04:38.900
- Non!
BOY: Monsieur?

04:39.080 --> 04:41.822
- (Blows thudding)
- (Woman sobs)

04:42.000 --> 04:43.900
WOMAN: Monsieur! Monsieur!

04:44.080 --> 04:45.399
(Woman sobs)

04:45.560 --> 04:47.187
(Guard speaks French)

04:57.920 --> 05:00.377
DEMELZA: News from Roscoff?
ZACKY: It's not good.

05:00.560 --> 05:03.745
Revolution has hit it hard.
lnformati0n'll be difficult to find.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.785
Ross'll need to bide a while.

05:05.960 --> 05:07.541
(Sighs) Course he do.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.984
When do anything go according to plan
with Ross?

05:12.680 --> 05:14.545
You've heard the latest?

05:14.720 --> 05:16.984
'Bout brother Sam?

05:17.160 --> 05:21.108
Not being allowed in church,
his brethren have taken to singing outside.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.464
Ye restless wanderers after rest

05:23.640 --> 05:27.144
QEMELZ4; I said there’d soon he . .
more ,o/igr/ms WIthout the church than WIth/n.

05:27.320 --> 05:30.983
It does sit uneasy with me,
this...show of defiance.

05:31.160 --> 05:33.025
'Tis not like they do any harm.

05:33.200 --> 05:35.703
They only praise the Lord in their own way.

05:35.880 --> 05:38.747
In their own way, yes, which the church forbid.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.740
But Odgers forbids them the church.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.706
Where must they go?

05:48.360 --> 05:52.501
DEMELZA: Ross don't want you worshipping
on his land, but would this not serve?

05:52.680 --> 05:54.545
The old Grambler Meeting House.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.779
'Twas gifted by Francis to the villagers.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.746
SAM: What happened to it?

05:58.920 --> 06:02.105
When George bought all the land hereabouts
and closed Grambler Mine,

06:02.280 --> 06:05.340
the village did empty
and all about fell to disrepair.

06:08.720 --> 06:11.223
He is a veritable John the Baptist.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.539
You're not of the connection yourself?

06:13.720 --> 06:19.067
My father was and grandfather afore him,
but I have more sense.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.219
- (Chuckles)
- 'Tis not so very decayed.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.943
It would take but a few good men
with timbers and nails.

06:24.120 --> 06:26.099
Where's Drake when you need him?

06:42.120 --> 06:44.702
GEOFFREY: Drake! Drake!

07:01.920 --> 07:03.899
Come on, Drake.

07:05.880 --> 07:10.624
GEORGE: Now I've become a magistrate,
I can begin to hunt a bigger prize.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.697
I wish to become a burgess of the borough.

07:14.880 --> 07:18.509
That would certainly advance
your influence in the district.

07:18.680 --> 07:21.626
But our recent mine closures,
trade monopolies, land enclosures,

07:21.800 --> 07:24.826
these have not endeared us to the vulgars.

07:25.000 --> 07:28.265
_With events_ in France
making our patncnans nervous,

07:28.440 --> 07:31.625
we should have a care
of how we're seen to treat our tenants.

07:31.800 --> 07:34.064
A less heavy-handed approach.

07:34.240 --> 07:36.617
A courting of public approval.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.667
George Warleggan, man of the people.

07:39.840 --> 07:43.617
(Chuckles)
Ross Poldark had better look to his crown.

07:48.520 --> 07:50.738
SOLDIER: Tu es un espion royaliste.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.785
Et tu viens avec nous!

07:52.960 --> 07:55.861
MAN: Monsieur! Monsieur, s'il vous plait!

07:56.040 --> 07:58.304
S'il vous plait! Non!

08:15.520 --> 08:17.499
(Breaking wind)

08:18.800 --> 08:20.700
(Both chuckle)

08:21.920 --> 08:24.423
Windy, was it, on the beach today?

08:25.960 --> 08:31.023
Oh, er... Why would you think so?

08:31.200 --> 08:34.340
Hair, face, shoes.

08:35.400 --> 08:38.904
You have to be sharp to out-trump me, boy.

08:39.080 --> 08:40.945
(Laughter)

08:41.120 --> 08:43.463
Did I hear you've been to Hendrawna Beach?

08:43.640 --> 08:48.760
Well, why not, in such fine weather?
Sea air does wonders for the lungs.

08:48.920 --> 08:52.617
Nevertheless, it's further than I'd wish you to go.
There are strong currents.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.679
- We never go near when the tide is full.
- And it's unsafe to be so far from home.

08:56.840 --> 09:01.539
There's unrest in the villages. The harvest
has failed. inevitably, there's discontent.

09:01.720 --> 09:05.941
- Take your father's pistol.
- I'd prefer you not to go at all.

09:06.120 --> 09:08.099
(Valentine cries)

09:08.280 --> 09:10.145
As you wish, cousin.

09:11.200 --> 09:14.863
He's not a bit like me, is he?

09:15.680 --> 09:17.147
Much darker.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.821
Mm.

09:22.720 --> 09:24.699
Hey, John, over here!

09:24.880 --> 09:27.462
(Chatter)

09:57.720 --> 09:59.699
THOLLY: He's here.

10:23.520 --> 10:25.579
ROSS: Monsieur Clisson.

10:28.280 --> 10:31.977
(French accent) The prison at Quimper,
most of the prisoners are English.

10:33.280 --> 10:34.827
Many are sick and wounded.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.865
Any officers among them?

10:37.040 --> 10:40.862
It's difficult.
The guards have orders to speak to no-one.

10:43.560 --> 10:45.425
But there is one I know.

10:45.600 --> 10:49.343
He tells me there are survivors of
a recent sea battle.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.827
Could he provide names?

10:53.000 --> 10:56.185
Possibly, for a price.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.146
How much?

11:00.880 --> 11:02.347
50...

11:04.040 --> 11:05.109
...for him.

11:05.280 --> 11:06.622
And 50 for me.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.987
- When do you return?
- Beware, monsieur.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.741
The Rpublique is watchful.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.181
(Clears throat)

11:31.240 --> 11:33.219
Tonight.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.539
Do 'ee trust him?

11:43.000 --> 11:46.629
No. But he's all we have.

11:56.120 --> 11:59.999
CARY: Francis Poldark gifted
the old chapel near Grambler village.

12:00.160 --> 12:02.025
He was always giving away property.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.543
- No doubt that's why he was so popular.
- Mm.

12:04.720 --> 12:08.542
We can have our attorney prepare
a formal deed of gift.

12:08.720 --> 12:11.985
It can be our first act of benevolence
toward the vulgars.

12:12.160 --> 12:15.664
Lately, a group of Methodists
have been repairing it.

12:16.840 --> 12:20.298
_ - Methodists? _
- That was Its former use, as a meeting house.

12:21.360 --> 12:24.386
Do you happen to know
the names of these Methodists?

12:25.240 --> 12:26.423
No, sur.

12:30.400 --> 12:33.904
As magistrate, I'm empowered to appoint
a constable for the district.

12:34.080 --> 12:36.457
- You will be such a one.
- I, sur?

12:36.640 --> 12:39.985
Your Trenwith duties will remain unchanged
but, in addition,

12:40.160 --> 12:43.505
- you'll be deployed on certain public errands.
- If 'ee say so, sur.

12:43.680 --> 12:47.821
What I say is that you will find me
the names of these Methodists.

12:48.520 --> 12:50.499
Yes, sur.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.743
And let us not be too hasty with our deed of gift.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.699
It may not be needed after all.

13:13.360 --> 13:14.679
(Groans)

13:15.720 --> 13:17.347
'Tis like old times.

13:17.520 --> 13:18.942
SOLDIER: Royalistes! Suive-moi!

13:19.120 --> 13:21.941
Confess, young Captain,
do 'ee not long for those days?

13:22.120 --> 13:27.342
- Thee, me and your father up to no good.
- I've had my fill of sailing close to the wind.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.824
I have a wife, a child, another on the way.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.219
I'll be keeping my head down
and my mouth shut.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.379
(Yawns)

13:48.160 --> 13:53.700
There are officers of the Army and Naw,
but it's not easy to get names.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.700
It will cost more.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.347
Hundred.

14:08.760 --> 14:12.025
50 now, 50 when you bring me the names.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.149
It will take time. Go home.

14:20.320 --> 14:23.699
- I send you word...
- I am not leaving Roscoff until I have a list.

14:27.920 --> 14:31.299
Then you must be on your guard.
Every hour you remain puts you in danger.

14:31.480 --> 14:34.984
The Republique may turn a blind eye
to the trade, not to spies.

14:35.160 --> 14:36.627
We are not spies.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.701
You seek information concerning
prisoners of the Rpublique.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.859
Some would call that spying.

15:20.440 --> 15:23.227
WOMAN: Puis je vous aider?
MAN: Merci, mademoiselle.

15:23.400 --> 15:24.867
(Signs)

15:26.520 --> 15:30.024
Whatever happened to that beauty
you once set your heart on?

15:31.200 --> 15:32.906
Chynoweth girl?

15:33.080 --> 15:34.900
She married my cousin.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.545
Harsh.

15:38.160 --> 15:40.219
I survived.

15:40.400 --> 15:45.064
I needed a wife who could chop wood and
skin rabbits as well as drink tea and curtsey.

15:46.240 --> 15:49.266
Your father would have bedded his maid,
not wed her.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.939
My father and I are not alike.

15:54.080 --> 15:55.786
Hm.

15:56.640 --> 15:59.382
And yet, here you are...

15:59.560 --> 16:02.142
(Sighs) ..with old Tholly again...

16:03.200 --> 16:05.065
...on another fool's errand.

16:05.240 --> 16:07.219
(Tholly chuckles)

16:11.880 --> 16:13.859
(Valentine gurgles)

16:16.960 --> 16:18.746
(Cries)

16:30.040 --> 16:32.019
GEORGE: Elizabeth?

16:33.600 --> 16:35.261
My dear, I'm leaving shortly.

16:35.440 --> 16:37.067
For what?

16:38.080 --> 16:39.820
My first appearance on the bench.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.904
- Perhaps you'd care to accompany me.
- Would I?

16:45.640 --> 16:48.825
_ I seem to recall _
FranCIs found It all qurte tiresome.

16:50.120 --> 16:52.702
No, I think my time is better spent here.

16:52.880 --> 16:55.064
There are household matters to attend to.

16:55.240 --> 16:56.946
Just as you like.

17:08.840 --> 17:10.819
(Low chatter)

17:15.760 --> 17:18.069
- God bless you.
- Thank you so much.

17:25.720 --> 17:28.507
- Ennemi du peuple!
-(Shouﬁng)

17:28.680 --> 17:30.659
Je suis innocente!

17:35.360 --> 17:38.147
(Jeering)

17:38.320 --> 17:39.787
(Shouﬁng)

17:39.960 --> 17:41.939
(Shouting continues)

17:47.320 --> 17:50.460
(Bell tolls)

17:51.640 --> 17:53.824
(Shouﬁng)

17:58.240 --> 18:00.219
(Jeering)

18:02.960 --> 18:05.178
I, George Warleggan...

18:05.800 --> 18:12.342
do swear that I truly and bona fide
have such an estate in law or equity,

18:12.520 --> 18:15.739
to and for my own use and beneﬁt

18:15.920 --> 18:17.239
as doth qua/i/j/ me to act

18:17.400 --> 18:19.743
as a Justice of the Peace,

18:19.920 --> 18:23.947
according to the true intent
and meaning of the Act.

18:24.720 --> 18:26.824
(Cheering)

18:31.640 --> 18:33.904
- Vive la Rpublique!
CROWD: Vive la Rpublique!

18:35.360 --> 18:36.577
MA/V: l/ive /a Rpublique!

18:36.760 --> 18:38.625
Vive la Rpublique!

18:40.120 --> 18:42.020
MA/V: l/ive /a Rpublique!

18:42.200 --> 18:44.987
CROWD: Vive /a Rpublique!

19:19.640 --> 19:21.904
Oh, that's all we need.

19:22.080 --> 19:24.344
She's had her eye on us since we arrived.

19:27.680 --> 19:29.819
Vive la Rpublique.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.865
As you say, mademoiselle.

19:32.040 --> 19:34.224
You are here on business?

19:35.520 --> 19:37.784
Importer of fine wines and spirits.

19:39.560 --> 19:41.221
Can you prove it?

19:43.040 --> 19:44.667
I have papers.

19:44.840 --> 19:47.400
- About you?
- In my room.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.460
Shall we go and inspect them?

19:55.520 --> 19:58.421
(Chuckles) My apologies, mademoiselle,

19:58.600 --> 20:02.297
I omitted to mention I'm married with a child.

20:03.560 --> 20:04.982
- I'm not.
- Tholly.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.980
- I'm ready, willing and able.
- Tholly.

20:07.160 --> 20:11.039
- Well, if he won't, I will.
- I must apologise for my servant, mademoiselle.

20:11.200 --> 20:14.340
- S_ervant! _
- You're a stranger In these parts, monsreur.

20:15.400 --> 20:18.984
And evidently not aware of
how useful it is to have friends...

20:20.320 --> 20:22.299
...as opposed to enemies.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.739
I humbly trust I've made none today.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.059
WOMAN: Calvados.

20:34.280 --> 20:37.659
(Background chatter in French)

20:38.840 --> 20:41.422
CAROLINE: How frustrating is a woman's lot?

20:42.440 --> 20:45.500
We're left idling at home
while the men go off and fight battles.

20:45.680 --> 20:47.181
Is that we do? Idle?

20:47.880 --> 20:50.462
Perhaps I've grown less bold since my marriage.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.619
I seriously doubt that.

20:53.480 --> 20:56.222
- I've been considering...
- Yes?

20:56.400 --> 20:58.584
...how could I get news of Dwight?

20:59.400 --> 21:03.587
Who do I know who has influence
and could use it on my behalf?

21:05.560 --> 21:08.120
A pheasant is no small matter.

21:08.880 --> 21:12.225
And the theft of such property from your betters

21:12.400 --> 21:15.460
shows a disrespect for authority
which cannot go unpunished.

21:16.520 --> 21:19.739
It now remains for me to pronounce on you
the awful sentence of the law

21:19.920 --> 21:24.300
which is that you be tied to a post
in the market square and publicly flogged.

21:24.480 --> 21:26.141
- (Courtroom hubbub)
- Twenty lashes.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.265
- Next case!
- No!

21:28.440 --> 21:30.579
-(Shouﬁng)
- (Woman sobs)

21:33.320 --> 21:35.504
Please, madam. Steady on.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.103
Your man sent this from Trenwith, sir.

21:57.560 --> 21:59.539
Justice Warleggan.

22:00.080 --> 22:02.503
Miss Penvenen,
were you here to see me do my duty?

22:02.680 --> 22:06.264
- I thought I'd look in. Most impressive.
- Mm.

22:06.440 --> 22:10.217
And may I suggest, quite as valuable
to our nation as those who fight our wars?

22:11.160 --> 22:15.620
Of course, a man in your position
must be privy to all sorts of news about the war.

22:15.800 --> 22:18.382
I know many of our acquaintances
would be grateful of news

22:18.560 --> 22:21.267
of Doctor Enys, for instance.

22:21.440 --> 22:24.079
I fear they would not.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.181
What makes you so sure?

22:27.360 --> 22:30.909
Dr Enys is not on any list of prisoners,
nor of survivors.

22:32.160 --> 22:34.344
One must sadly assume the worst.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.346
DRAKE: Mr Warleggan's taking it back?

22:42.400 --> 22:45.039
SAM: Can he do that?
- Well, he own the land.

22:45.200 --> 22:49.944
- It was gifted to the brethren by Mr Francis.
- Verbally gifted, nothing writ down.

22:50.120 --> 22:53.066
- What harm could it do to let us use it?
DEMELZA: None at all.

22:53.240 --> 22:56.824
But you've defied him,
so he means to put you in your place.

22:57.880 --> 23:01.099
- So what's to be done?
- With Captain Ross not here to fight our corner.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.545
'Tis in the Lord's hands now.

23:05.600 --> 23:09.502
With respect, Sam,
sometimes the Lord do need a little help.

23:17.560 --> 23:21.109
- But Cap'n Ross said, "On no account..."
- "Must you venture on Trenwith land"?

23:21.280 --> 23:23.840
Well, Captain Ross ain't here now, so I say do it.

23:24.000 --> 23:28.505
Elizabeth's there alone. 'Twas her late husband
Francis did make the gift to the brethren.

23:28.680 --> 23:30.989
So she might have more sympathy
than Mr Warleggan?

23:31.160 --> 23:33.025
Not if she sees me.

23:33.200 --> 23:36.863
- Will you keep it civil, Zaclq?
- Easier said than done.

24:02.120 --> 24:06.102
Clisson will meet us here on Sunday night.
He has definite information.

24:06.280 --> 24:09.704
- What did I tell 'ee? Now we can rest easy.
WOMAN: Vous savez quoi faire.

24:11.920 --> 24:15.060
- I suspect not.
- Will you come with us, monsieur?

24:16.200 --> 24:20.785
Fils de pute! Laissez—le! Pour I'amour de Dieu,
c'est une marchande Anglais!

24:21.760 --> 24:24.137
Qu'a-t'il fait de mal?

24:31.560 --> 24:35.826
DRAKE: Remember what sister said.
No mention of our names nor relationship.

24:36.000 --> 24:39.060
What be the cause of this ill will
between the two houses?

24:39.240 --> 24:43.267
'Tisn't for me to say, boy, but 'tis powerful.

24:48.040 --> 24:50.304
Master's not home.

24:51.400 --> 24:53.265
'Tis the mistress we've come to see.

24:53.440 --> 24:57.137
She know me by sight and name:
Zachariah Martin.

24:59.160 --> 25:01.424
You two, follow me.

25:01.600 --> 25:04.057
And you, wait here.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.263
- Me? But...
- Mr Warleggan's orders.

25:08.440 --> 25:12.069
No more than two riffraff in the house
at any one tIme.

25:12.520 --> 25:13.703
(Clicks his tongue)

25:21.160 --> 25:22.741
(Door opens)

25:23.200 --> 25:24.269
(Door closes)

25:24.440 --> 25:26.419
(Bird squawks)

25:29.280 --> 25:33.944
- Drake? Drake! Is it really you?
- Ssh, Master Geoffrey.

25:34.120 --> 25:36.304
I'm here with brother and Zacky Martin.

25:36.480 --> 25:40.382
They've business with your mother, but
it will not be good for you to be seen with me.

25:40.560 --> 25:41.879
Oh, what do I care about that?

25:42.040 --> 25:46.625
Besides, these are actually my gardens,
or will be one day.

25:46.800 --> 25:49.621
ROSS: I am not an enemy of France.

25:49.800 --> 25:54.385
I am merely a businessman trying to conduct
a trade, which is to the benefit of France.

25:54.560 --> 25:58.439
It is not to the benefit of France to permit spies
to come ashore and live among us.

25:58.600 --> 26:03.424
I'm not a spy. Since arriving here, I have made
no attempt to venture beyond Roscoff,

26:03.600 --> 26:05.704
nor to act contrary to the interests of France.

26:05.880 --> 26:10.385
You went entirely against it by spending a night
on French soil without reporting to Gendarmerie.

26:10.560 --> 26:13.859
My apologies, monsieur,
I had no idea there was such a requirement.

26:14.040 --> 26:18.545
The penalty for a first of fence is imprisonment.
For a second: execution.

26:21.840 --> 26:23.705
As this is a first of fence,

26:23.880 --> 26:26.303
and committed without malice...

26:27.760 --> 26:34.268
...perhaps you will permit me to pay a fine
in lieu of imprisonment?

26:36.120 --> 26:38.577
Say, 20 guineas.

26:51.160 --> 26:53.139
50.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.218
(Coins jingling)

26:59.080 --> 27:00.627
50. (Clears throat)

27:00.800 --> 27:03.303
On the condition that
you leave Roscoff Immediately.

27:04.360 --> 27:08.421
- My ship will not return until Monday night.
- The May Queen is leaving tonight.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.465
You will board her without delay.

27:10.640 --> 27:15.179
- Perhaps the offer of a further 50 guineas...
- Will lead to your immediate imprisonment

27:15.360 --> 27:17.999
for attempting to suborn
an officer of the Rpublique.

27:18.720 --> 27:22.668
If you are found ashore after midnight,
you will be executed.

27:25.800 --> 27:27.984
SOLDIER: Avance.

27:40.880 --> 27:43.781
So we thought,
since Mr Francis gifted land to the brethren...

27:43.960 --> 27:47.020
- Are you quite sure he did that?
- Begging your pardon, ma'am,

27:47.200 --> 27:50.897
I was there with my old father
when Mr Francis made the promise.

27:51.080 --> 27:53.583
SAM: So we ask your kind help, ma'am.

27:53.760 --> 27:57.708
For, in the saving of this house,
you'll be doing God's handiwork.

27:58.760 --> 28:02.389
- Will I?
- And we shall pray for the saving of your soul.

28:03.440 --> 28:06.785
Any help 'ee can give
would be much appreciated.

28:06.960 --> 28:10.657
I should be getting back.
Brother and Mr Zaclq will be soon done.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.900
_ - Oh.
- MISS Morwenna.

28:15.560 --> 28:18.825
- Why are you here?
- I came with my brother.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.945
He did speak with Mrs Warleggan.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.661
Tell Drake, Morwenna.

28:23.840 --> 28:26.900
Tell him he must visit
whenever Mama and Uncle George are away.

28:27.080 --> 28:30.664
- Oh, I'm not sure...
- You'd like that. You know you would.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.979
You're always talking about him.

28:35.480 --> 28:39.746
_ _ _ IfI write a note
InVItIng you to the house, Will you come?

28:39.920 --> 28:42.297
Oh, pardon my asking.

28:42.480 --> 28:44.141
You can read?

28:44.320 --> 28:46.185
Of course.

28:46.360 --> 28:48.624
I... I think I must go.

28:48.800 --> 28:52.463
Er, until the next time, Miss Morwenna.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.265
I'll speak to Mr Warleggan when he returns

29:02.440 --> 29:06.183
and explain that you viewed this promise
made by my late husband as a binding one.

29:06.360 --> 29:09.147
Of course, I cannot guarantee he'll reconsider.

29:09.320 --> 29:12.778
May the Lord ever guide 'ee
and teach 'ee to walk in His ways.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.825
We'll take no more of your time.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.900
- Good day to you both.
BOTH: Good day.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.179
All in all, 'twas a good day's work.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.146
FEMALE SELLER: Achetez mes oignons!

29:51.320 --> 29:52.708
Allez!

29:54.040 --> 29:55.177
What now?

29:55.360 --> 29:57.225
We appear to be leaving.

29:57.400 --> 29:59.379
(Grunts)

30:00.280 --> 30:01.417
SOLDIER: Allez! Avance!

30:09.280 --> 30:11.259
You had visitors today, Cousin?

30:11.840 --> 30:16.709
Miners from the village petitioning my husband
about the use of a meeting house on our land.

30:17.240 --> 30:18.628
GEOFFREY: Let 'em have it, I say.

30:18.800 --> 30:24.739
Hark 'ee, Elizabeth, after all
'tis actually the child's land, or will be.

30:27.480 --> 30:31.257
- Surprised Elizabeth was that civil.
- They were careful not to tell her their names.

30:31.440 --> 30:33.579
Or their connection to Ross.

30:33.760 --> 30:36.103
Have you always been a fiend for prayer?

30:36.280 --> 30:38.419
Nay, Mistress Paynter.

30:39.480 --> 30:45.669
I did live without God in the gal! of bitterness
and the bond of iniquity for upward of 20 year.

30:46.160 --> 30:49.618
Though God did pardon my sins
and set my soul at liberty.

30:49.800 --> 30:52.667
Now Sam has found salvation
stronger than the rest of us.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.823
Sister, I've a favour to ask 'ee.

30:59.920 --> 31:03.265
- Yes?
- Will 'ee teach me to read?

31:06.440 --> 31:08.021
ELIZABETH: Were you stern?

31:08.200 --> 31:10.657
Fair. I sent out a clear message.

31:11.280 --> 31:14.306
Where the crime is severe, expect no mercy.

31:15.160 --> 31:17.139
And I had several compliments on my robes.

31:19.760 --> 31:21.705
While you were away, we had visitors.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.337
- Some Methodists.
- Methodists?

31:24.520 --> 31:30.140
Zacky Martin and another man
asking after the Grambler Meeting House.

31:30.320 --> 31:34.347
These religious sects make me uneasy.
They're seed beds for revolution.

31:34.520 --> 31:37.387
- They insist Francis promised them the land.
- But did he?

31:37.560 --> 31:39.937
I doubt Zaclq Martin would lie.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.065
- And the other man?
- Seemed genurne.

31:42.240 --> 31:44.800
I think Zacky called him Sam.

31:44.960 --> 31:46.825
Came?

31:47.000 --> 31:48.661
Samuel Came?

31:49.720 --> 31:51.347
Demelza's brother.

31:54.320 --> 31:57.505
So...now you see the plan.

31:57.680 --> 32:02.504
Ross sends his brother-in-law to take advantage
as soon as my back is turned,

32:02.680 --> 32:04.625
to encroach upon our lives yet again.

32:04.800 --> 32:08.179
- I cannot believe he would presume...
- And yet he has, once again.

32:08.360 --> 32:10.669
- How_dare he?
- So we're In agreement?

32:12.080 --> 32:14.583
They must on no account be allowed the land?

32:16.400 --> 32:18.186
On no account.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.979
(Gulls crying)

32:25.400 --> 32:27.379
SOLDIER: Allez!

32:28.720 --> 32:30.699
Avance!

32:34.040 --> 32:37.419
CAROLINE:
George was adamant, quite certain of it.

32:37.600 --> 32:39.579
His name was not on any lists.

32:43.880 --> 32:46.337
Well, Ross is not yet returned.

32:46.520 --> 32:49.944
I hope for all our sakes
he is now aboard a ship bound for home.

32:57.040 --> 32:59.622
THOLLY: Good riddance to France, I say.

32:59.800 --> 33:03.304
I've never been so glad to see
the back of that godforsaken cesspit.

33:04.680 --> 33:07.660
Would have been more than
our lIves are worth to have stayed.

33:09.640 --> 33:13.019
What 'ee did,
keep your head down and your mouth shut,

33:13.200 --> 33:15.259
'twas what any sensible man would do.

33:16.640 --> 33:18.619
Indeed.

33:21.480 --> 33:23.584
Get word to my wife I've been delayed.

33:27.720 --> 33:29.142
(Whispers) Ross.

33:29.320 --> 33:30.708
Ross.

33:31.800 --> 33:33.779
(Retreating footsteps)

33:36.440 --> 33:38.419
(Panﬁng)

34:08.400 --> 34:10.379
(Dog barks in distance)

34:14.720 --> 34:16.699
MAN: Cherchez partout!

34:39.320 --> 34:42.062
"Young Cap'n Ross d'most sincerely regret..."

34:42.240 --> 34:46.267
Oh, he'll regret ever sending home his hat,
for it won't fit his head when I'm done with him.

34:46.440 --> 34:48.101
- 'Tain't right.
- 'Tisn't fit.

34:48.280 --> 34:49.907
- 'Tain't fair.
- 'TaIn't proper.

34:50.080 --> 34:53.959
- A child to raise and another on the way.
- A farm to run and a mine beside.

34:54.120 --> 34:58.545
Oh! How the men folk have t_he_cheek
to expect us to do theIr bIddIng.

34:59.040 --> 35:00.701
Luclq we never do.

35:03.440 --> 35:07.137
- I'm still livid at Ross's insolence._
- I too, to encourage such presumptIon.

35:07.320 --> 35:11.017
Encourage? He surely planned it,
to cause disruption to us yet again.

35:11.200 --> 35:13.384
Dear God! Are we never to be rid of him?

35:17.400 --> 35:20.585
Not here, perhaps, but elsewhere.

35:21.680 --> 35:27.505
If we removed to our town house in Truro,
we'd be out of his immediate vicinity.

35:27.680 --> 35:30.103
Of course, we'd take Valentine with us.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.462
And Geoffrey Charles?

35:32.640 --> 35:34.665
He could remain with Morwenna and your aunt.

35:39.560 --> 35:41.141
I'll miss him, of course, but...

35:42.480 --> 35:45.062
...the thought of being out of Ross's reach...

35:45.240 --> 35:48.744
Then, shall we leave today?

35:48.920 --> 35:50.865
The sooner, the better.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.059
S-S-Sa. ..

36:06.240 --> 36:08.105
Sam.

36:08.280 --> 36:10.464
Dee-me...

36:10.640 --> 36:12.267
De...

36:12.440 --> 36:14.817
Demelza.

36:16.280 --> 36:18.259
He said yes?

36:19.680 --> 36:24.982
He said we must put down our tools
and set no foot there again on pain of death.

36:25.160 --> 36:28.744
Why? What would it cost him?

36:29.680 --> 36:31.659
How could it hurt him to...?

36:34.160 --> 36:37.709
No, of course,
he must know that you're my brothers.

36:38.680 --> 36:41.581
Judas! Must it always be such a battle?

36:44.760 --> 36:48.184
Shake my hand, Geoffrey Charles.
That's what young gentlemen do.

36:50.960 --> 36:52.507
Remember, Morwenna,

36:52.680 --> 36:54.341
- keep him at his studies.
- Of course.

36:54.520 --> 36:58.502
- And don't let him waste his time at cards.
- I wouldn't dream of it.

36:58.680 --> 37:00.261
I'll miss you, Mama.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.863
AUNT AGATHA:
Now we can have some fun. (Cackles)

37:18.040 --> 37:19.905
Voleur!

37:20.080 --> 37:22.457
(Shouting in French)

37:38.840 --> 37:41.502
I see why Father was loath to part with 'ee.

37:41.680 --> 37:45.662
You carry the world on your shoulders
and ne'er stoop 'neath the weight.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.984
At present, 'tis more than I wish to bear.

37:50.040 --> 37:52.497
Ross is no help, he's a law unto himself.

37:53.680 --> 37:56.057
Sometimes, I d'wonder why I wed him.

37:57.120 --> 38:00.783
And yet, sister,
is all love not tricksical sometimes?

38:00.960 --> 38:04.418
I promised to love, honour and obey him.

38:05.960 --> 38:07.939
And why should l...?

38:12.240 --> 38:13.707
What, sister?

38:14.880 --> 38:16.745
What is it?

38:16.920 --> 38:18.899
I know where you can worship.

38:20.600 --> 38:23.103
SAM:
Cap'n Ross would gift we this store house?

38:23.280 --> 38:25.737
Nay, brother, 'tis I do gift you this store house.

38:25.920 --> 38:29.299
- Clean it out, fill it up, it is yours.
DRAKE: Brother Ross won't like it.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.619
No more than I like certain antics of his.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.188
And what's his is mine.

38:34.280 --> 38:37.067
So take it and make it your church.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.218
GEORGE: Well, my clear,
is the house to your liking?

38:55.400 --> 38:56.469
ELIZABETH: Perfectly so.

38:56.640 --> 38:59.985
I realise how long
I've been stultifying in the countryside.

39:00.160 --> 39:02.139
I feel I can breathe again.

39:03.640 --> 39:06.427
And since we're in town sooner than planned,

39:06.600 --> 39:09.467
perhaps you'd care to join me
on my next appearance in court.

39:09.640 --> 39:13.224
I shall endeavour to make it
as entertaInIng as the ﬁrst.

39:23.960 --> 39:27.782
Now, this we will set in writing.
I want no misunderstanding of the law this time.

39:29.440 --> 39:30.702
Water!

39:36.680 --> 39:38.261
MAN: Allez!

40:00.720 --> 40:02.426
They told me you had left.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.579
I came to see if it were true.

40:04.760 --> 40:07.069
- Have you the list?
- Have you the guineas?

40:07.240 --> 40:11.904
- I've given you guineas. Show me the list.
- Monsieur, our agreement...

40:12.080 --> 40:14.901
- When I have a list, you will have your fee.
- Have a care.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.298
We are attracting attention.

40:19.240 --> 40:22.266
- Give me the list.
- I must not be seen here.

40:27.520 --> 40:30.865
WOMAN: Well, monsieur, did you miss me?

40:31.480 --> 40:33.459
Is that why you came back?

40:34.240 --> 40:36.299
We could have been such good friends.

40:37.760 --> 40:41.309
I was unmannerly before, mademoiselle.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.698
You made a generous offer.

40:44.760 --> 40:46.864
I did not appreciate my good fortune.

40:47.040 --> 40:48.382
Perhaps it is not too late.

40:48.560 --> 40:50.585
You're very kind, ma'am...

40:51.600 --> 40:52.988
...but I fear it is.

40:58.280 --> 41:01.340
GUARD: Arretz cet homme! Attention!

41:02.080 --> 41:04.537
(Man shouts in French)

42:02.520 --> 42:04.499
(Clears throat)

42:07.520 --> 42:09.499
From Lord Godolphin.

42:10.120 --> 42:12.304
- An invitation to a banquet.
- How splendid.

42:19.080 --> 42:21.059
Ah.

42:22.440 --> 42:27.059
Apparently his young nephew Anthony
is to come before the court tomorrow...

42:28.320 --> 42:30.697
...on a charge of assaulting a servant girl.

42:32.120 --> 42:33.906
Oh.

42:44.080 --> 42:46.457
- So, we are in agreement?
- Yes.

42:48.640 --> 42:50.267
(Whispering)

42:50.440 --> 42:52.021
Yes. Mm.

42:53.040 --> 42:58.819
We see before the court today a person
who has been wronged in the grossest manner.

42:59.760 --> 43:01.739
Lies have been told.

43:02.880 --> 43:04.859
A blameless reputation is at stake.

43:07.400 --> 43:11.780
In our view, what is required here
is to set an example

43:11.960 --> 43:17.307
in order to deter other persons
from committing a like of fence.

43:21.640 --> 43:24.700
Polly Tregaskis,
the court considers you have committed perjury

43:24.880 --> 43:28.099
and slandered the good name of
Anthony Godolphin.

43:28.280 --> 43:31.386
- (Gasps of shock)
- You'll be committed for trial at the next assizes.

43:33.960 --> 43:36.064
(Chatter and sobbing)

43:37.080 --> 43:38.342
WOMAN: Justice prevailed.

43:38.520 --> 43:40.101
(Polly sobs)

43:44.680 --> 43:47.057
CAROLINE: Everything points to
a
sorry end.

43:48.600 --> 43:52.058
After all this time,
I cannot think that any news will be good.

43:53.280 --> 43:58.058
Nor I, from what I've learned from Tholly
of conditions in France...

44:04.960 --> 44:07.337
I think we must both prepare for the worst.

44:12.640 --> 44:18.465
This helpful little tincture
calms the nerves and fortifies the constitution.

44:21.440 --> 44:26.104
Three drops as and when required.

44:50.680 --> 44:52.659
(Laughter)

44:56.600 --> 44:59.182
(Giggles) Come!

45:09.160 --> 45:10.548
Go on.

45:10.720 --> 45:12.585
Go on, I dare you.

45:12.760 --> 45:14.079
- (Giggles)
- No.

45:14.240 --> 45:16.219
Dare me something else, Miss Morwenna.

45:16.400 --> 45:18.300
Dare me something worth daring.

45:18.480 --> 45:21.222
- Such as?
- Dare me...

45:21.400 --> 45:23.379
I don't know.

45:24.560 --> 45:26.539
Dare me to kiss ye.

45:29.680 --> 45:33.264
But, then, I'd never presume so far,
knowing t'would not be fitting.

45:33.440 --> 45:34.623
No.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.984
It would not.

45:37.160 --> 45:38.741
(Geoffrey giggles)

45:42.480 --> 45:43.822
GEOFFREY: Wahey!

45:44.000 --> 45:45.786
Not with Geoffrey Charles here.

46:19.200 --> 46:20.667
(Horse whinnying)

46:20.840 --> 46:22.421
(Approaching hooves thudding)

47:02.360 --> 47:04.339
(Coughing)

47:06.160 --> 47:08.344
- (Man cries out)
GUARD: Allez!

47:08.520 --> 47:11.307
Vous avez entendu!

47:12.200 --> 47:13.303
(Man cries out)

47:13.480 --> 47:15.425
(Shouting in French)

47:15.600 --> 47:17.386
(Mutters angrily)

47:17.560 --> 47:19.266
Porquoi tu es venu en France?

47:22.240 --> 47:25.380
- Oh, Ross! He's alive.
- For what that's worth.

47:26.640 --> 47:30.986
If you knew what conditions are like
in France for enemies of the Republic...

47:31.160 --> 47:33.139
GUARD: Avance!

47:34.800 --> 47:36.267
Allez!

47:37.440 --> 47:38.657
En joue!

47:38.840 --> 47:42.298
- Feu!
- (Gunshots)

47:43.320 --> 47:45.743
You must go to Caroline,
put her out of her misery.

47:50.240 --> 47:51.901
DWIGHT: Bring him here!

47:53.320 --> 47:55.697
_ - What is_ his name? _
- ArmItage, SIr. LIeutenant ArmItage.

47:55.880 --> 47:58.622
- From HMS Espion.
- Bring me water, quickly.

47:58.800 --> 48:00.665
Lieutenant Armitage!

48:00.840 --> 48:02.819
Can you hear me, sir?

48:03.880 --> 48:06.587
Is there water? I need water!

48:10.600 --> 48:12.784
(Man coughing)

48:16.320 --> 48:18.299
(SObs)

48:37.600 --> 48:40.979
GEORGE: Archie Godolphin was very affable.

48:44.640 --> 48:45.709
Was he?

48:45.880 --> 48:49.225
Invited me to dispense with
the formality of "Lord Godolphin".

48:49.960 --> 48:53.179
Conveyed his appreciation
at my astute judgement

48:53.360 --> 48:55.669
and sensitive handling of the case...

48:57.040 --> 49:01.818
And reminded me of our invitation to his
banquet next Thursday at Godolphin House.

49:05.920 --> 49:10.937
I suspect it won't be long
before we have a burgess in the family.

49:12.200 --> 49:14.179
At the very least.

49:33.840 --> 49:35.705
Oh, Jesus

49:35.880 --> 49:39.782
Ride on till all are subdued

49:39.960 --> 49:42.827
Thy mercy make known

49:43.000 --> 49:46.379
And sprinkle Thy blood

49:46.560 --> 49:49.586
Display Thy salvation

49:49.760 --> 49:52.217
And teach the new song

49:52.400 --> 49:55.380
To every nation

49:55.560 --> 49:59.223
And people and tongue

49:59.400 --> 50:02.745
Oh, Jesus, ride on

50:02.920 --> 50:06.185
Till all are subdued

50:06.360 --> 50:08.737
Thy mercy make known

50:08.920 --> 50:11.787
And sprinkle Thy blood

50:11.960 --> 50:14.667
Display Thy salvation
- You could do worse than Rosie Nanfan.

50:14.840 --> 50:16.262
I believe 'ee, brother.

50:16.440 --> 50:17.941
Shall 'ee speak to her father?

50:18.120 --> 50:19.985
'Twould be to no purpose, brother.

50:20.160 --> 50:22.264
My heart's already bespoke.

50:22.440 --> 50:24.305
ROSS: The old storehouse?

50:24.480 --> 50:28.257
- By whose permission?
- By mine, Ross. Who else would say so?

50:28.440 --> 50:31.500
You would take such a decision
WIthout consultIng me?

50:35.080 --> 50:38.504
- You seriously ask me that?
- I seriously ask it, yes.

50:40.560 --> 50:42.539
Who am I, Ross?

50:44.560 --> 50:46.107
My wife.

50:46.280 --> 50:48.259
And when you're away, who do I refer to?

50:48.440 --> 50:51.898
Do I wait for you to return
and fill the void you've left behind?

50:52.080 --> 50:54.059
Or do I step into it?

50:54.680 --> 50:56.989
Live my life as if you be not in it?

50:57.160 --> 51:02.826
I've a child to support, another on the way,
a farm to run and a mine beside.

51:03.000 --> 51:07.869
Other women may bow and scrape
and ask permission, as I once did.

51:08.600 --> 51:10.340
Butnolongen

51:10.520 --> 51:12.579
For all I knew, you were never coming back...

51:13.600 --> 51:15.067
...then I'd be head of the family.

51:15.240 --> 51:17.379
But I have come back.

51:26.400 --> 51:28.379
You're right.

51:31.600 --> 51:34.865
I have no business questioning
what you did in my absence.

51:36.720 --> 51:39.302
You're my wife, not my chattel.

51:41.760 --> 51:44.547
France is a desperate place...

51:45.920 --> 51:50.380
...and there were times
when I doubted whether I'd come back alive.

51:53.720 --> 51:55.699
And now that I have...

51:56.960 --> 52:00.339
...I'm not about to quibble
with the conditions of my return.

52:03.080 --> 52:06.902
Well, perhaps if you behave well...

52:09.000 --> 52:11.377
...they may be warmer than you deserve.

52:33.520 --> 52:35.579
(Coughing)

52:35.760 --> 52:37.739
(Man shivering)

52:42.800 --> 52:44.779
ARMITAGE: What is this place?

52:46.200 --> 52:48.179
Am l...?

52:50.760 --> 52:52.739
Am I dead?

52:54.120 --> 52:57.226
- Is this Hell?
- (Gunshots)

53:01.080 --> 53:03.822
You're alive, my friend...

53:04.880 --> 53:06.586
...but you'll wish you were not.

53:08.280 --> 53:10.259
We're all in Hell now.

53:11.960 --> 53:14.144
(Distant booming)

53:18.800 --> 53:21.018
GEORGE: A most satisfactory day.

53:21.760 --> 53:23.739
Do you not think?

53:26.040 --> 53:27.507
George, let him lie.

53:27.680 --> 53:30.023
He must not constantly be fussed over.

53:30.200 --> 53:33.829
Oh, must he not?
My boy must not be fussed over.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.865
On the contrary.

53:36.040 --> 53:38.497
He must be cherished, exulted.

53:38.680 --> 53:40.147
(Chuckles)

53:40.320 --> 53:45.519
He is, after all, my son and heir
and all I now do is for his benefit.

53:45.680 --> 53:48.183
So, yes, a most pleasing day.

53:48.360 --> 53:53.582
And all in all, I think we may say
we are exactly where we wish to be.

53:56.160 --> 53:58.139
(Thunder rumbles)

54:13.600 --> 54:16.467
No doubt you were plagued by French beauties.

54:17.720 --> 54:19.699
No doubt I was.

54:20.120 --> 54:22.338
No doubt you availed yourself.

54:22.800 --> 54:24.779
No doubt I did...

54:26.240 --> 54:28.504
...for I have no beauty at home to compare.

54:30.440 --> 54:32.419
Have I?
