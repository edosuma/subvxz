00:17.000 --> 00:19.801
<i>Somebody get me a beer,
please.</i>

01:18.796 --> 01:21.264
You gonna be my girlfriend!

01:22.066 --> 01:23.227
I said...

01:23.435 --> 01:25.198
- you gonna be my girlfriend!
- Get off me!

01:25.404 --> 01:27.770
Get off me!
You hurting me!

01:32.245 --> 01:33.770
Stop it!

02:12.094 --> 02:13.792
Texas.

02:18.569 --> 02:23.030
<i>True love. Two words
I never quite understood.</i>

02:23.742 --> 02:27.179
<i>Where was this place in the world
and how could it be found?</i>

02:27.513 --> 02:31.711
<i>Have faith. That's something
I understood even less.</i>

02:32.186 --> 02:36.885
<i>Could you change it, or we just blindly
following the natural order of life?</i>

02:38.159 --> 02:40.428
<i>When I was a baby,
my mother died in a car crash,</i>

02:40.429 --> 02:42.529
leaving my father and I alone.

02:43.265 --> 02:45.625
<i>He never spoke of it, I assumed
that he carried the grief...</i>

02:45.626 --> 02:47.726
nightly inside himself.

02:48.172 --> 02:51.301
<i>At bedtime, he'd always point out
at the night sky, and said...</i>

02:51.309 --> 02:53.770
<i>"there's your moon, Amy",
isn't it beautiful?</i>

02:53.979 --> 02:56.140
<i>That's where your dreams
come from.</i>

02:57.116 --> 03:00.142
<i>But, as I grew older,
the words "true love and faith...</i>

03:00.153 --> 03:02.544
<i>seams illusive
as my dream.</i>

03:02.922 --> 03:07.251
<i>Until one day, they all collided
against my shot to life.</i>

03:07.662 --> 03:11.631
<i>And for me,
it all began right about...</i>

03:12.467 --> 03:13.829
<i>here.</i>

03:16.272 --> 03:17.662
Someone's in trouble.

03:17.874 --> 03:18.806
Where?

03:18.807 --> 03:21.608
I just pull over and look
if anyone's inside.

03:26.518 --> 03:28.186
All right.

03:32.459 --> 03:35.394
I don't know, man,
I don't see anybody.

03:35.395 --> 03:38.087
Well, I'll go check it out.
You stay here.

03:54.952 --> 03:57.112
- Holy shit, Earl!
- What?

03:57.222 --> 03:59.181
- You gotta see this.
- What is that?

04:04.331 --> 04:06.561
Car-load of shit
everywhere!

04:08.470 --> 04:10.165
Yeah, what is it?

07:35.154 --> 07:38.448
Viagra I tell you, is the greatest
fucking thing in the world.

07:38.657 --> 07:40.421
Yeah, that's if you needed.

07:40.426 --> 07:42.421
If you don't need it,
who gives a shit.

07:42.428 --> 07:45.666
I'm gonna tell you something, this...
this Viagra is a wonder potion.

07:45.767 --> 07:48.599
You have a great big boner
that does the "Deep Down".

07:50.272 --> 07:54.038
Hello, Deb.
Two sugars today, yeah.

07:54.744 --> 07:57.475
I need some
sweetin' up.

07:58.382 --> 07:59.349
Thanks Deb.

07:59.383 --> 08:02.285
Hey, speakin' of heart,
take a look over there.

08:05.758 --> 08:07.587
Leave the lady alone, alright?

08:07.593 --> 08:10.321
John, you sure
you don't want some of this Viagra?

08:10.629 --> 08:13.731
No, I told you,
that you guys work our asses off.

08:13.900 --> 08:18.101
Alright, you guys finish up here. Somebody's
gotta do some work around this town.

08:18.139 --> 08:20.570
Yeah, uh...
you'll be working on that.

08:28.318 --> 08:31.483
- That's for the sheriffs, uh... coffee.
- You got it.

08:32.057 --> 08:33.354
Hi, Sam.

08:34.592 --> 08:36.355
Let me take a look at you.

08:38.731 --> 08:41.063
Well, you look the same.

08:41.267 --> 08:42.792
Thank God.

08:44.104 --> 08:47.897
I saw your news this morning,
what was that all about?

08:48.109 --> 08:51.078
Yeah, well, there should never been
any news at all.

08:52.513 --> 08:55.449
I don't how the media
get's a hold of that.

08:57.450 --> 08:59.451
- Mh-hm.
- Hm...

09:00.291 --> 09:03.455
- Well, what a surprise.
- Hm...

09:03.795 --> 09:07.526
Oh, I gotta go back to work.
You know, I make my living here.

09:07.899 --> 09:11.092
- Good seeing you.
- Same here, you mind if I walk you out?

09:12.605 --> 09:14.233
Yeah, why not?

09:19.046 --> 09:20.912
How's the ranch going?

09:21.116 --> 09:23.310
Well, we're hanging in there,

09:23.911 --> 09:26.112
gettin' by on the skin of our teeth,
you know.

09:27.790 --> 09:29.553
You look great, Sam.

09:30.894 --> 09:32.795
- You too, John.
- Thanks.

09:34.332 --> 09:35.732
How's Amy?

09:36.168 --> 09:37.795
She's nearly a woman now.

09:38.036 --> 09:39.697
I can imagin', yeah.

09:40.807 --> 09:43.232
- Long time.
- Yeah, long time.

09:47.348 --> 09:48.440
Well...

09:49.550 --> 09:51.681
- See you around.
- See you around.

09:52.587 --> 09:55.613
- Keep your other side down.
- Always do.

10:55.264 --> 10:58.356
Sweetie, my dear...

10:59.702 --> 11:01.534
I miss you so much.

11:05.509 --> 11:08.034
Maybe I'll just join you.

11:08.235 --> 11:09.235
Hm?

11:10.782 --> 11:15.185
Oh, I could now put this silver bullet
in my own head.

11:21.229 --> 11:22.930
Oh...

11:22.931 --> 11:25.099
Oh, I know,
oh, I know.

11:43.889 --> 11:46.583
You think I got parts for all this.

11:46.592 --> 11:48.385
Look at the work, mister.

11:49.096 --> 11:52.326
Guys, you know what I hate,
I hate my job.

11:52.532 --> 11:56.469
- Hard day at the offfice?
- Ah, samo, samo. Give me a cigarette.

11:56.670 --> 11:57.570
Sure.

11:59.108 --> 12:00.575
Walla.

12:00.777 --> 12:02.677
Never loose it, sister.

12:07.017 --> 12:08.017
Hey...

12:08.018 --> 12:09.780
Honey alert!

12:12.791 --> 12:16.319
I dare you,
to go make contact.

12:17.196 --> 12:19.561
- I'm okay.
- Come on.

12:19.666 --> 12:24.260
- Just do it, don't be scared.
- I don't want to, I'm not scared, I just...

12:24.371 --> 12:26.531
I'm a little more selective
then you guys.

12:26.741 --> 12:29.938
- So selective, you haven't been laid yet.
- Yeah.

12:30.145 --> 12:31.635
So?

12:31.847 --> 12:34.315
Come on,
chicken-shit.

12:34.516 --> 12:36.884
- Just do it. Come on, little lady.
- Do it, do it.

12:37.088 --> 12:39.112
- Come on... Go.
- Go! Come on, go!

12:48.768 --> 12:50.629
I just talked to him
the other day.

12:51.137 --> 12:52.999
Can Amy pick up an ass-hole...

12:53.300 --> 12:55.300
- you think?
- I don't think so.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.501
Hey.

12:59.314 --> 13:00.872
Can I help you with sometin'?

13:01.449 --> 13:04.442
Hey, you live here.
Right?

13:05.855 --> 13:07.289
Yeah, I know.

13:23.411 --> 13:27.338
I saw you driving that little car
the other day. Is that yours?

13:27.339 --> 13:28.340
Yep.

13:30.855 --> 13:35.287
Hey!
What you think you're doing?

13:36.426 --> 13:37.757
Smoking.

13:37.760 --> 13:39.458
Yeah, you can't smoke here.

13:39.563 --> 13:42.431
Oh, I'm sorry,
sorry.

13:48.808 --> 13:50.440
That's a beautiful car.

13:51.878 --> 13:53.243
What is it?

13:53.647 --> 13:56.216
It's a 68 AMX.

13:56.617 --> 13:59.347
- Do you do all the work on this...
- Look, kid...

14:00.522 --> 14:03.548
if I sit here and talk you,
I never would get any work done.

14:03.559 --> 14:06.251
So, why don't go
play somewhere else.

14:08.131 --> 14:09.526
See you around.

14:11.168 --> 14:12.829
Whatever.

14:20.445 --> 14:22.740
See you guys later,
I'm gonna go home.

14:32.027 --> 14:33.688
Jesus Christ, mother...

14:49.014 --> 14:50.841
Would you like to ride?

14:51.283 --> 14:54.549
- Not today
- Come on?

14:54.554 --> 14:56.278
Look, I'm sorry.

15:00.127 --> 15:03.858
- It's windy out.
- I like the wind.

15:16.448 --> 15:19.173
Look, I'm sorry about that earlier.

15:19.384 --> 15:23.185
I only been working here a week, kid,
the boss is kind of brick.

15:23.189 --> 15:25.303
I guess there's a lotta
bricks in that shop.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.657
Yeah, I guess so.

15:30.531 --> 15:32.524
Wait here for one second.

15:46.318 --> 15:47.525
I'm sorry.

15:49.754 --> 15:51.145
It's a fucking cactus!

15:51.724 --> 15:54.526
Well, use your imagination.
It could be a flower.

15:54.527 --> 15:55.527
Okay.

15:58.065 --> 15:59.061
I'm Amy.

16:01.301 --> 16:03.748
- Dan.
- Nice to meet you.

16:05.073 --> 16:06.697
Nice to meet you too.

16:23.463 --> 16:26.226
I had that thing purring
like a chick in an hour.

16:26.302 --> 16:29.479
I swear to God, the old mans' jaw,
about hit the ground.

16:30.404 --> 16:32.209
That's why
you got the job, huh?

16:32.698 --> 16:34.470
Yep.

16:39.849 --> 16:40.933
So...

16:42.685 --> 16:43.650
So...

16:48.759 --> 16:50.030
Will I see you again?

16:51.263 --> 16:53.808
I don't know. Maybe.

16:56.636 --> 16:58.532
My dad's real protective.

17:02.643 --> 17:04.625
Well, I can live with maybe.

17:08.282 --> 17:10.301
Why don't you drop
by the shop sometime?

17:10.987 --> 17:13.070
I promise
I won't be such a brick.

17:13.756 --> 17:15.760
Alright.
As long as you promise.

17:17.328 --> 17:19.425
- Thank you.
- Any time.

17:23.928 --> 17:25.028
Oh...

17:26.438 --> 17:27.896
Don't forget your flowers.

17:28.242 --> 17:29.737
I don't wanna forget that.

17:31.378 --> 17:32.370
Bye.

18:08.023 --> 18:09.674
Jack on the rocks.

18:16.066 --> 18:17.467

18:18.101 --> 18:20.817
No, man, I'm just visiting.

18:21.773 --> 18:23.545

18:25.577 --> 18:27.079

Stop, that's my sign.

18:57.550 --> 18:58.911
Oh, come on...

18:59.185 --> 19:02.383
You don't believe in astrologie?
What's your rising sign?

19:03.256 --> 19:04.576
I don't know.

19:05.926 --> 19:07.489
I think it's stupid.

19:08.529 --> 19:09.875
Can I see your hand?

19:15.237 --> 19:16.952
You know what that says?

19:18.142 --> 19:19.835
Rosie Palmer.

19:21.345 --> 19:22.990
You're a fucking ass-hole!

19:26.151 --> 19:27.603
Wasn't that sometin'?

19:37.398 --> 19:39.809
Gimlet for one of your fancy girls.

19:40.068 --> 19:42.157
The girl over by the pool table.

19:42.358 --> 19:43.903
<i>Do you want it
sweet or dry,</i>

19:43.904 --> 19:45.568
<i>- ripe or fruity?
- Fruity.</i>

19:45.741 --> 19:47.086
You got it, buddy.

19:53.851 --> 19:56.032
<i>- You see that guy over there?
- I don't know him.</i>

19:56.088 --> 19:57.519
<i>He just bought you a drink.</i>

20:00.021 --> 20:01.621
<i>Who got next game?</i>

I be damned! I know a lot more,
we're going out tonight.

20:32.599 --> 20:34.038
Besides...

20:34.668 --> 20:38.240
you looked like you needed rescuing
from those beers uptown.

20:38.241 --> 20:39.641
"Wankers only".

21:42.149 --> 21:44.915
- I like a girl with experience.
- I'm not a hooker.

21:44.916 --> 21:48.411
- Not here.
- Let's go in my truck outside, alright?

22:41.521 --> 22:45.665

22:46.594 --> 22:48.663
Get outta the truck!

22:48.664 --> 22:51.432
Come here you fuck

22:51.433 --> 22:53.419
Stop! No! Stop it!

22:53.435 --> 22:55.993
Get the fuck back in the truck,

22:58.677 --> 23:00.563
Yeah!
You like that?

23:01.847 --> 23:03.479
You want more, huh?

23:05.381 --> 23:07.581
Stay the fuck

23:13.927 --> 23:14.830
No...

23:24.006 --> 23:25.265
See that, huh?

23:26.108 --> 23:28.242
This is your boyfriend!

23:33.619 --> 23:34.619
Hey!

23:34.620 --> 23:37.477
Give me the shovel, ass-hole!
I asked you for the fucking shovel.

24:32.490 --> 24:33.690
Hey...

24:34.191 --> 24:36.169
Keep the fuck away.

24:37.329 --> 24:39.090
I'm busy right here.

24:55.050 --> 24:57.523
There's so many rich people
they're just out there...

24:57.622 --> 25:00.881
waiting for the perfect
Miss Fabulous to come along.

25:00.924 --> 25:03.424
They're coming here lining up,
and all I have to say is please.

25:03.427 --> 25:04.377
Give me a break.

25:04.529 --> 25:07.781
Okay, fine. Then I'll just take 'em off
until they're 3 inches longer.

25:07.782 --> 25:08.782
You would.

25:12.639 --> 25:14.153
Quit your smoking.

25:20.581 --> 25:21.584
Hey, ladies.

25:23.586 --> 25:25.664
You wouldn't happen to be
Johns daughter?

25:25.722 --> 25:27.415
Hm?
Would you?

25:28.492 --> 25:29.592
Yeah, I am.

25:29.593 --> 25:32.374
I... I was just...
I was in the neighborhood,

25:32.375 --> 25:33.576
and thought I stop by.

25:33.598 --> 25:34.844
Is your dad around?

25:35.466 --> 25:37.280
He actually just left,
but he'll be right back.

25:37.281 --> 25:38.281
Hm...

25:39.171 --> 25:41.060
Is there anything
I can do for you, sheriff?

25:41.440 --> 25:43.222
Um... no,
no, just, um...

25:43.742 --> 25:47.008
just... tell him
I... I stopped by, okay?

25:47.009 --> 25:48.209
Who do I tell him?

25:48.314 --> 25:51.381
Sam's the name.
Your father and I...

25:51.419 --> 25:53.358
Yeah, my dad,
he...

25:54.188 --> 25:56.501
- he told me about you.
- Oh, good.

25:56.536 --> 25:58.005
Good things,
I would think.

25:58.093 --> 25:59.037
Good.

26:00.197 --> 26:02.768
Good, um...
I tell you what, just...

26:02.769 --> 26:05.068
- tell him that I was here.
- Sure thing.

26:05.069 --> 26:09.252
Been great to...
to be hanging out, do nothing.

26:09.449 --> 26:11.253
Sure be nice,
to see you again.

26:11.254 --> 26:13.244
- You too.
- Okay... bye you all.

26:13.545 --> 26:14.599
Bye.

26:40.846 --> 26:41.981
Where are you?

26:42.849 --> 26:44.710
Oh, here you are.

26:50.858 --> 26:52.548
- Hi.
- Hi-ah.

26:53.027 --> 26:54.061
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:54.429 --> 26:56.401
Come on, come on.

26:57.302 --> 26:58.267
Hey...

26:58.568 --> 26:59.571
How are you?

26:59.936 --> 27:00.819
Thank you.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.120
Thank you.

27:12.384 --> 27:13.743
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

27:13.744 --> 27:15.945
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

27:57.806 --> 27:59.432
Why walk,
when you can ride?

28:00.543 --> 28:02.995
Uh... I'm alright,
thank you, though.

28:03.880 --> 28:07.287
I wouldn't feel right, if I was gonna
let you walk over there all by yourself.

28:09.954 --> 28:13.560
Relax. I know your dad,
big John over at the ranch.

28:13.892 --> 28:15.294
He wouldn't want me
to leave you here.

28:16.328 --> 28:17.263
You know my dad?

28:18.353 --> 28:19.623
Yeah.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.019
Alright.

28:24.671 --> 28:25.664
Get in the car.

28:30.045 --> 28:31.612
It is kind of cold.

28:51.438 --> 28:54.860
- Where we going?
- Rustig aan. This will just take a second.

28:54.942 --> 28:56.140
I wanna go home now.

28:56.710 --> 28:58.050
We have to have
some fun first.

28:58.051 --> 28:59.351
Fuckin' bitch.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.123
- Get off me!
- Yeah.

29:01.716 --> 29:02.672
Fuckin' bitch!

29:05.289 --> 29:08.312
- Get off me!
- Yeah, you fucking like that?

29:09.059 --> 29:10.331
Help me!

29:12.163 --> 29:13.309
Get outta the car!

29:14.265 --> 29:16.781
- Chicken-shit!
- Where the fuck did you come for?

29:23.877 --> 29:26.368
You brick.
Stay away from her.

29:33.722 --> 29:34.909
Amy, let's go.

29:43.502 --> 29:44.709
Are you okay?

29:51.877 --> 29:52.995
It's alright.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.549
- Are you okay?
- Mh-hm.

30:40.369 --> 30:41.282
Yeah.

30:42.539 --> 30:45.161
- Are you?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

30:50.114 --> 30:51.604
Where are you from originally?

30:54.789 --> 30:56.089
Well...

30:56.891 --> 30:58.314
I moved around a lot.

30:58.993 --> 31:00.507
Guess you could say,
I am from...

31:02.130 --> 31:03.515
everywhere and anywhere.

31:06.768 --> 31:08.779
So, what you doing
out here tonight?

31:12.242 --> 31:14.378
I don't wanna freak you out,
but...

31:17.414 --> 31:20.017
I've been following you
ever since the first day we met.

31:22.087 --> 31:23.564
So, you're a stalker?

31:24.890 --> 31:26.690
No, it's nothin' like that.

31:29.430 --> 31:31.001
You seam different.

31:32.302 --> 31:34.703
Sorta like the outsider like me.

31:40.677 --> 31:42.349
I'm really glad,
you were there tonight.

31:43.546 --> 31:46.827
That guy told me he's...
friends with my dad.

31:51.156 --> 31:53.999
This... certainly never happened
to me before.

31:59.198 --> 32:00.400
It's okay.

32:13.884 --> 32:15.188
Did you have a good night?

32:15.719 --> 32:18.437
Hey, dad.
Yeah, it was fun.

32:19.190 --> 32:20.671
You didn't have to wait for up,
though.

32:21.527 --> 32:22.854
Evidently I do.

32:23.896 --> 32:25.122
Who drove you home?

32:26.031 --> 32:27.027
Just a friend.

32:27.767 --> 32:28.802
A friend?

32:32.006 --> 32:33.608
He's no friend, Amy.

32:35.209 --> 32:36.559
It's not like that, dad.

32:40.882 --> 32:42.282
I'm going to sleep.

32:44.721 --> 32:45.657
Good night, dad.

32:46.390 --> 32:49.424
- Don't give me that face.
- Good night, dad.

32:50.094 --> 32:51.045
Good night.

32:53.365 --> 32:54.766
Son of a bitch!

33:47.864 --> 33:49.218
What you doing out here, Sam?

33:50.066 --> 33:53.753
- Oh, you think you're fast, huh?
- But I believe, the slowest got it.

33:54.573 --> 33:55.938
You should?

33:58.711 --> 34:02.282
- Look at that slicin' moon up there, girl.
- It's magical.

34:12.494 --> 34:14.652
I like it out here.

34:51.708 --> 34:53.130
Jesus Christ!

34:53.577 --> 34:54.525
My God!

34:55.313 --> 34:56.431
What's wrong?

35:19.709 --> 35:21.451
Amy! Over here!

35:22.647 --> 35:24.049
I love you!

35:29.254 --> 35:31.275
Oh, my God!

35:33.259 --> 35:36.008
- Amy, you gotta come in!
- You're crazy.

35:41.335 --> 35:42.836
- You'll enjoy it.
- You're crazy.

35:42.871 --> 35:45.006
- What you waiting for, let's go.
- Is it cold?

35:45.007 --> 35:46.407
- Huh?
- Is it cold?

35:46.442 --> 35:48.083
- Come on, take your clothes off.
- No...

35:48.384 --> 35:50.684
Come and join me.
It's great!

36:39.773 --> 36:41.176
It isn't cold.

36:42.710 --> 36:43.922
Go ahead!

36:46.248 --> 36:47.542
Watch your step.

36:57.796 --> 36:59.416
The water is cold!

37:19.422 --> 37:20.718
I got an idea.

37:28.299 --> 37:29.509
What are you doing?

37:31.903 --> 37:35.319
I'm lettin' you take the wheel.
Come on, slide over!

37:44.186 --> 37:47.278
You shift her in first,
it's a four speed and let it go.

37:47.313 --> 37:48.737
I know how to drive, Mario.

37:48.790 --> 37:50.792
Let me just see
if you got that.

37:50.894 --> 37:53.086
- You got your seat-belt on?
- I'm no dummy.

37:54.397 --> 37:55.990
Are you ready?

37:56.467 --> 37:59.148
- If you go a little faster, it's fine.
- Oooh...

37:59.649 --> 38:00.650
Okay.

38:03.441 --> 38:06.228
- Not bad for a rookie.
- Wanna see what this car can do?

38:06.312 --> 38:08.604
Oh, I know
what this car can do, trust me.

38:16.725 --> 38:19.364
<i>I didn't realize it at the time
that this small thing...</i>

38:19.365 --> 38:21.666
<i>the memoires I was collectin'
would sustain me...</i>

38:21.700 --> 38:24.205
<i>now I carry them with me forever.</i>

38:39.252 --> 38:40.552
<i>No, it's not out there yet...</i>

38:40.553 --> 38:43.959
Dear, I know you like this,
but this sure gives me the creeps.

38:45.392 --> 38:47.658
Then why come back to that
anyway, Linda?

38:47.659 --> 38:49.059
Oh, it's nothing.

38:49.232 --> 38:51.189
Look, Floyd!
Oh... oh... oh...

40:30.587 --> 40:31.836
Go get him, Norman!

40:34.458 --> 40:36.372
You son of a bitch!

41:14.741 --> 41:16.126
You mother-fucker!

41:26.622 --> 41:29.371
Shit! What a crazy fuck!
I'm gonna kill the fucker!

41:29.425 --> 41:31.289
Get your ass back here,
I'll kill you!

42:23.991 --> 42:26.217
Why?
Why me?

42:26.218 --> 42:27.218
Why!

42:27.696 --> 42:29.054
What did I do?

42:36.741 --> 42:37.715
Why?

42:56.331 --> 42:58.564
Hey, what in the world
happened to you?

42:59.801 --> 43:01.441
Got the motor runnin' here,

43:01.442 --> 43:03.343
get in the truck
and I'll take you to town.

43:15.221 --> 43:18.869
- It's about fucking time, Sam.
- What is going on, Louie?

43:18.925 --> 43:20.705
Well, I was hopin'
you could tell me.

43:21.428 --> 43:23.315
- Come here.
- Let's see.

43:28.737 --> 43:30.221
Fuckin' pretty, ain't it?

43:36.146 --> 43:39.999
It's some bad shit, I tell you!
Mother-fuckers are pissin' me off!

43:47.193 --> 43:49.530
- Come over here.
- Louie, I'm coming.

43:50.063 --> 43:51.957
- Come on, over here.
- Coming, Louie.

43:55.136 --> 43:56.473
Take a look at this shit!

43:58.840 --> 44:00.682
- God.
- Yeah.

44:01.143 --> 44:03.847
I took a shot at the mother-fucker!
I don't know if I hit anything.

44:03.913 --> 44:05.113
To fuckin' dark.

44:05.715 --> 44:10.152
I don't know what the fuck's over here?
But... that's a dog lying here.

44:10.287 --> 44:11.817
The other half is in there.

44:23.070 --> 44:25.597
What I wanna know is what the fuck
you gonna do about this Sam!

44:25.639 --> 44:27.831
Goddamn it, I don't need anymore
of your crap Louie!

44:28.176 --> 44:30.242
I'm sick and tired
of your bull-shit.

44:32.048 --> 44:35.206
Go down to my truck
and bring me my camera...

44:36.385 --> 44:39.238
It's on the seat,
I... need to take picture.

44:40.590 --> 44:43.204
I swear to God, I'm getting
sick and tired of this shit!

44:43.795 --> 44:45.406
The best fucking dog I ever had!

44:45.407 --> 44:47.908
Some mother-fucker's gonna die,
behind this shit, I tell you!

44:47.909 --> 44:50.809
As soon as I can get,
this mother-fucker.

45:29.450 --> 45:31.403
I waited for hours last night.

45:32.888 --> 45:33.973
Where were you?

45:36.993 --> 45:38.490
Hell, Amy.

45:39.291 --> 45:41.392
I was in hell.

46:11.501 --> 46:13.101
Those will kill you,
you know?

46:14.138 --> 46:18.265
Is this a fucking joke?
This it least a choice.

46:24.184 --> 46:25.359
What is it, Dan?

46:28.122 --> 46:30.082
You know you can tell me
anything, right?

46:33.662 --> 46:35.032
Anything Amy?

46:35.564 --> 46:36.564
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

46:36.565 --> 46:39.621
Anything? What makes you
sure with everything?

46:40.137 --> 46:41.437
Huh?

46:41.838 --> 46:43.330
What makes you so sure?

46:48.413 --> 46:50.013
Because I'm in love with you.

47:02.563 --> 47:03.606
Okay.

47:05.968 --> 47:06.875
Okay!

47:08.270 --> 47:09.819
I've become the wolf, Amy.

47:11.441 --> 47:12.612
I know you are.

47:12.909 --> 47:16.021
Listen to me!
I'm a fucking werewolf!

47:18.115 --> 47:21.519
Those slayings at the farm?
That was me.

47:25.324 --> 47:26.538
Well, what are you saying?

47:27.828 --> 47:29.116
It's true, Amy.

47:32.400 --> 47:33.820
It's real.

48:09.912 --> 48:11.812
Remember
what you promised me...

48:13.382 --> 48:15.301
I scream,
you drive away.

48:16.787 --> 48:18.716
You never told me about
when you were a kid.

48:20.024 --> 48:21.487
It's not much to tell...

48:22.760 --> 48:23.904
I don't remember much.

48:34.775 --> 48:37.379
Sometime I...
see my mother...

48:38.814 --> 48:41.896
she's running through a forest,
with somethin' chasing her.

48:43.987 --> 48:47.092
I think it's me, but...
I never quite remember.

48:49.660 --> 48:52.799
I have this memory,
this vision of her...

48:53.665 --> 48:56.133
holding me.
which is just so real.

48:58.337 --> 49:02.077
When I reach out to touch her,
she just fades away.

49:07.715 --> 49:08.868
And your father?

49:11.488 --> 49:12.589
Yeah...

49:14.190 --> 49:15.636
good old dad.

49:16.359 --> 49:18.167
I never even knew my father.

49:23.769 --> 49:26.570
Amy, it's happenin'!
Get outta here!

49:27.206 --> 49:28.839
- Are you okay?
- Amy, go!

53:51.193 --> 53:52.883
Goddamn it, Amy.

53:53.730 --> 53:55.185
<i>There's this kid...</i>

53:55.698 --> 53:56.736
a drifter...

53:57.367 --> 53:59.464
he seams to be hangin' around Amy
and I thought...

54:00.237 --> 54:02.618
Wait a minute, you're talking about
the kid at the auto-shop?

54:03.420 --> 54:05.920
- Nice car he's got.
- Oh, come on, Sam.

54:06.379 --> 54:09.322
There's somthin' creepy about him.
He's... he's strange.

54:09.349 --> 54:10.828
I don't want him
anywhere near Amy.

54:12.352 --> 54:14.450
Okay, lets...
lets get this straight.

54:15.656 --> 54:19.193
You want me to maybe arrest him,
because your daughter like him?

54:20.563 --> 54:21.697
No, well I thought...

54:24.032 --> 54:28.481
you know, you could... scare him off.
Or shoot him or hang him.

54:29.172 --> 54:31.994
Well I... I don't kow
if I can do that, John.

54:33.277 --> 54:34.825
He ain't broken any laws.

54:34.947 --> 54:38.567
Oh, Jesus Christ, Sam!
Come on, that's ridicules!

54:38.985 --> 54:41.072
I don't want that son of a bitch
around my daughter.

54:41.288 --> 54:43.316
I mean, do I have to beg you
to do someting?

54:44.191 --> 54:45.138
Funny...

54:47.262 --> 54:49.087
that's exatly how my dad...

54:50.465 --> 54:54.427
God rest his soul,
felt about us back then.

54:55.104 --> 54:57.026
Didn't make a bid of differnce,
did it?

54:58.909 --> 55:01.744
Okay, I get it laud and clear,
but I'm telling you, he's trouble.

55:02.847 --> 55:06.185
I mean please, could you just...
just check him out?

55:12.726 --> 55:15.003
Why is it people
who have never raised kids...

55:15.429 --> 55:17.654
always have an opinion
of how it should done?

55:17.666 --> 55:19.654
Stop! Woa, wait... wait a minute,
you... you're right,

55:19.655 --> 55:22.103
I... I have no experience
raising kids.

55:22.104 --> 55:25.407
I'm not giving you any advise,
on how to do any of if.

55:25.608 --> 55:29.151
I'm not speaking as a parent,
I am speaking as a law-man.

55:30.614 --> 55:35.832
As a law-man I'm telling you,
Amy needs to learn a few things on her own.

55:36.821 --> 55:38.270
Come on, Sam.

55:39.391 --> 55:41.870
- Come on.
- I see what I can do.

55:43.396 --> 55:44.393
Thanks.

56:04.688 --> 56:05.995
You sure about this?

56:07.225 --> 56:08.888
It costs you dollar.

56:12.999 --> 56:15.772
- I got it.
- He's the man. He's got the money.

56:21.409 --> 56:22.366
Thank you.

56:27.551 --> 56:28.951
Okay...

56:28.952 --> 56:30.105
let's begin.

56:33.224 --> 56:36.874
We were wondering if you...
knew anything about, um...

56:38.931 --> 56:40.908
people that
change in their life?

56:40.909 --> 56:41.909
Hm...

56:42.335 --> 56:43.635
Things that are...

56:44.704 --> 56:46.707
kind of crazy
and unimaginable.

56:46.708 --> 56:47.709
Hm.

56:52.981 --> 56:54.989
Like, uh...

56:55.024 --> 56:56.998
Like vampires?

56:58.921 --> 56:59.924
Gablets?

57:02.491 --> 57:04.301
Werewolves?

57:05.296 --> 57:06.461
The werewolves?

57:10.903 --> 57:12.901
Sometimes called
"Skin-shifters".

57:13.472 --> 57:14.719
"Windigowak".

57:16.209 --> 57:17.243
"Glabligouk".

57:25.554 --> 57:28.219
The things our minds can conject
can be very real.

57:35.132 --> 57:38.167
The problem we're talking about,
is yours, isn't it?

57:41.907 --> 57:42.861
Yes.

57:45.077 --> 57:46.450
Give me hand.

57:49.049 --> 57:50.596
Close your eyes.

57:52.453 --> 57:54.452
Take a deep breath and focus.

58:23.024 --> 58:25.609
You are...
you are c... cursed.

58:27.796 --> 58:29.217
You one of them...

58:31.434 --> 58:32.406
Exuse me...

58:33.837 --> 58:34.858
Exuse me...

58:36.273 --> 58:38.030
Mother in haven!
Mother in haven...

58:39.110 --> 58:40.208
Mother in haven...

58:46.985 --> 58:48.045
What's that?

58:49.255 --> 58:52.325
This will...
this will protect you from...

58:53.294 --> 58:54.257
From me?

58:54.763 --> 58:57.511
No.
From the curse...

58:59.067 --> 59:00.356
and its origin.

59:01.704 --> 59:04.783
- How did this happen?
- This was...

59:07.611 --> 59:11.163
It started...
with your father.

59:13.318 --> 59:16.012
- My father?
- And was passed on to you.

59:16.022 --> 59:19.636
I don't even know who my father is,
not alone know, if he's even alive.

59:19.637 --> 59:20.548
Oh, he's alive...

59:22.095 --> 59:23.244
I can feel him...

59:26.934 --> 59:28.782
Okay, what do you do,
when you have problem?

59:30.205 --> 59:31.134
What do mean?

59:31.875 --> 59:37.956
If... if he didn't exist,
the curse would not be upon you.

59:39.450 --> 59:42.115
You see this werewolf?
Right here?

59:44.022 --> 59:45.889
He got cursed
to a sorcery.

59:46.591 --> 59:51.095
His was the first...
the first hated blood.

59:53.734 --> 59:54.959
That's your daddy...

59:56.770 --> 59:58.324
he brought this down on you...

59:59.340 --> 01:00:03.021
Your are his descendent.
You are his beta.

01:00:04.613 --> 01:00:06.978
Is there any... hope?

01:00:07.951 --> 01:00:09.379
Can we...

01:00:11.956 --> 01:00:16.739
I think there still is hope, because
you have not tasted the human blood.

01:00:16.895 --> 01:00:19.933
But, look at me.
Look at me!

01:00:22.969 --> 01:00:26.374
Once you have it,
your soul...

01:00:28.576 --> 01:00:29.520
your soul...

01:00:30.078 --> 01:00:37.083
Not from being within you,
except become... that what you already are.

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:39.618
How do you know
I haven't killed a human?

01:00:40.022 --> 01:00:41.726
Because I feel it.
Because I...

01:00:41.826 --> 01:00:44.213
I know... I...
I feel it.

01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:47.174
No lies in your eyes...

01:00:48.033 --> 01:00:51.871
You're... you're... you're save with him.
You're save with him.

01:00:53.974 --> 01:00:55.466
So, it's okay?

01:00:57.145 --> 01:00:58.372
It's your father...

01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:03.981
He cherishes the curse...

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:08.789
and he can kill... anytime,
anywhere, that he wants.

01:01:09.926 --> 01:01:12.838
And retain human intelligent...

01:01:13.330 --> 01:01:16.957
clear knowledge
and mind of his acts.

01:01:22.976 --> 01:01:27.589
He's more dangerous...
then you'll ever know.

01:01:28.516 --> 01:01:30.675
Is there anything
I can do about this?

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:37.179
My guees is...

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:42.579
you gotta kill your daddy.

01:01:49.174 --> 01:01:50.390
Good bye.

01:01:50.976 --> 01:01:53.083
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:01:53.145 --> 01:01:54.536
Please don't let out the kiddy.

01:01:56.383 --> 01:01:57.418
Thank you.

01:02:04.359 --> 01:02:07.607
When everything else fails,
you've got your instincts.

01:02:11.335 --> 01:02:13.953
It sounds
really, really weird...

01:02:14.271 --> 01:02:18.073
what's going on around guys,
I don't know, at this moment.

01:02:19.864 --> 01:02:21.350
My instincts are screaming.

01:02:21.361 --> 01:02:26.065
- Well, what they screaming, Sam?
- Louie called me a couple of days ago.

01:02:26.067 --> 01:02:28.965
And I went over to his house,
and looked around,

01:02:28.966 --> 01:02:32.767
and what I saw,
didn't make sence at all.

01:02:34.044 --> 01:02:37.912
He thought thatreally was a wolf,
and I did too.

01:02:39.653 --> 01:02:41.822
- Until...
- Until what?

01:02:43.026 --> 01:02:44.753
I went over to the fence line...

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:49.726
and on the other side, I discovered
these huge deep foot prints.

01:02:49.836 --> 01:02:52.395
- Foot prints of a man?
- No.

01:02:52.405 --> 01:02:54.168
What?
Animal what?

01:02:54.209 --> 01:02:55.344
I don't know.

01:02:55.545 --> 01:03:01.777
I don't know, it... it... looked like
it must've weight about 300 pounds.

01:03:01.787 --> 01:03:06.024
I mean, what in the hell
could be so big and strong...

01:03:06.025 --> 01:03:09.120
that is able to kill
a 1000 pound horse...

01:03:09.131 --> 01:03:11.956
and then leaped in
to a dog at the same time?

01:03:12.001 --> 01:03:14.538
Maybe one big-ass wolf?

01:03:17.676 --> 01:03:20.342
You know the wolves
hunt in packs.

01:03:20.346 --> 01:03:24.904
Besides what... what's a wolf gonna
be doing down here at this time of year?

01:03:24.982 --> 01:03:27.109
Maybe it's a rabid wolf.
I don't know?

01:03:27.188 --> 01:03:28.445
A mountain lion?

01:03:29.346 --> 01:03:31.147
Walking on two feet?

01:03:31.157 --> 01:03:33.390
But, see that's what doesn't
make sence here.

01:03:33.425 --> 01:03:39.320
I went back to the accident,
there's the clinch. The girl.

01:03:39.463 --> 01:03:43.791
Same slaughter, same M-O,
same mystery.

01:03:43.802 --> 01:03:45.403
But...

01:03:45.404 --> 01:03:51.967
who or whatever killed her,
walked on four feet.

01:03:52.108 --> 01:03:56.543
And had a taste for human blood.
Female human blood.

01:03:57.848 --> 01:04:01.675
And the bite was the same?
With truckers?

01:04:01.952 --> 01:04:05.853
No, the truckers were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

01:04:05.855 --> 01:04:07.980
- How you figure?
- Well, quite easy...

01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:10.349
there were no skid marks,
no crash.

01:04:10.359 --> 01:04:12.926
- They were just... passing by.
- And they pulled over to help.

01:04:13.127 --> 01:04:14.027
Yeah.

01:04:14.129 --> 01:04:16.857
- And the killings were different.
- Different how?

01:04:17.833 --> 01:04:20.134
Well, again, whoever went in
to kill this woman,

01:04:20.735 --> 01:04:23.936
raped her first...
sexually...

01:04:24.038 --> 01:04:26.071
played with her.

01:04:26.107 --> 01:04:30.843
When we found her, she only
had her nylons and her shoes on.

01:04:31.779 --> 01:04:34.944
That's a cold-blooded
calculated kill.

01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:37.647
Ma'am.

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:42.445
I know who you are.

01:04:44.624 --> 01:04:46.993
Then you know
I gotta kill you.

01:04:47.294 --> 01:04:51.056
- I'm a good person.
- You're a fucking sick bitch!

01:04:51.265 --> 01:04:52.758
I'm not...

01:05:00.506 --> 01:05:04.500
- This will fucking do.
- Oh, Lord, he's coming with some book...

01:05:21.259 --> 01:05:23.259
You didn't tell me
you had a pussy-cat.

01:05:31.902 --> 01:05:34.400
- Read a good book lately?
- No...

01:05:40.502 --> 01:05:42.103
Fuck you.

01:05:50.018 --> 01:05:52.245
How do you know
he's not looking for you?

01:05:52.255 --> 01:05:54.623
I don't know.

01:06:00.261 --> 01:06:02.154
He's probably out there
somewhere.

01:06:09.705 --> 01:06:11.799
I'll stay with you.

01:06:24.352 --> 01:06:26.015
Amy, it's happenin' here.

01:06:29.255 --> 01:06:30.651
Get in the car!

01:06:32.325 --> 01:06:34.253
It's happenin'!

01:06:36.128 --> 01:06:37.788
Get in the car, Amy!

01:07:42.290 --> 01:07:45.289
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey, John.

01:07:47.294 --> 01:07:49.061
Long time no see.

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:52.056
Can't get enough
of me?

01:07:52.367 --> 01:07:54.058
Looks like.

01:07:54.469 --> 01:07:57.600
I just wanna tell you, crazy Louie
is stirrin' up the embrease...

01:07:57.601 --> 01:07:58.901
in the Town Hall Casino.

01:07:58.938 --> 01:08:00.702
That sure is a problem.

01:08:04.278 --> 01:08:07.772
- Leave your car here, we go in mine.
- Sounds good.

01:08:15.522 --> 01:08:17.654
The fact is, sheriffs' department
ain't doin' shit.

01:08:18.924 --> 01:08:21.125
They're fine for eatin' donuts
and drinking coffee.

01:08:21.126 --> 01:08:23.126
- Yeah!
- No wonder things gettin' all fucked up.

01:08:23.162 --> 01:08:25.727
- It's time for us to step in!
- Hell, yeah!

01:08:25.831 --> 01:08:27.529
We ain't sittin' around here
no more!

01:08:27.529 --> 01:08:28.430
- No!
- No!

01:08:28.468 --> 01:08:30.627
We're armed to kick
some fuckin' ass, right now!

01:08:30.636 --> 01:08:32.359
Everybody, listen up!
Listen up!

01:08:32.371 --> 01:08:35.005
The sheriff department is here
for two reasons:

01:08:35.006 --> 01:08:36.707
To serve and to protect.

01:08:36.707 --> 01:08:40.104
And that is exactly what I've been doing
for the past three years.

01:08:41.312 --> 01:08:46.246
I don't want... any of you
shooting up in the county...

01:08:46.247 --> 01:08:49.148
with not a brain between you.

01:08:50.020 --> 01:08:53.046
- You're on my watch be warned.
- Your watch?

01:08:53.357 --> 01:08:56.187
My dog got killed on your watch.
My horse.

01:08:56.193 --> 01:08:58.893
This whole fuckin' thing is a disaster!
What the fuck you gonna do?

01:08:58.995 --> 01:09:02.227
- Watch your mouth around the lady.
- Lady?

01:09:02.332 --> 01:09:04.993
That just seams to be
your fuckin' problem, don't it?

01:09:05.001 --> 01:09:07.965
What we need around here
is some balls.

01:09:10.506 --> 01:09:14.438
Do I count the sheriffs department
won't handle that matter.

01:09:16.845 --> 01:09:18.970
Now listen to me clearly.

01:09:19.214 --> 01:09:22.805
I don't wanna see any of you
toting fire-arms in my county...

01:09:22.818 --> 01:09:26.246
or you'll be prosecuted
to the fullest extend of the law.

01:09:26.354 --> 01:09:28.122
And that means jail.

01:09:28.991 --> 01:09:30.082
Am I clear?

01:09:30.883 --> 01:09:32.183
You got it?

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:34.752
And you, Louie...

01:09:35.764 --> 01:09:37.866
Any more shit
coming out of your mouth,

01:09:37.867 --> 01:09:42.568
and I will put you in jail,
for trying to incite a riot.

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:49.167
Oh, your fly is open, Louie.

01:09:51.778 --> 01:09:54.613
Well now, which one
is the biggest pussy?

01:09:55.716 --> 01:10:00.076
You know... the only reason your ass
isn't up around your ears, is I have...

01:10:00.277 --> 01:10:01.978
respect for the sheriff.

01:10:02.422 --> 01:10:06.652
You know what?
I might get around to it.

01:10:07.493 --> 01:10:09.284
- I'll be waiting.
- How about now?

01:10:09.285 --> 01:10:10.685
Hey, hey, hey

01:10:12.464 --> 01:10:14.825
- Hey, stop it!
- Come on, come on, come on, stop it.

01:10:15.133 --> 01:10:16.527
- John!
- Come on.

01:10:16.528 --> 01:10:17.429
John!

01:10:17.437 --> 01:10:19.802
About to shove this shit
up your ass!

01:10:20.972 --> 01:10:24.333
John, John! Alright.
It's okay, come on.

01:10:31.481 --> 01:10:34.540
You were really going
to kick his ass, weren't you?

01:10:35.719 --> 01:10:36.884
Hell yeah!

01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:41.580
Wanna go on a date with me?

01:10:42.926 --> 01:10:44.688
Hell yeah!

01:10:48.331 --> 01:10:50.324
The view is better now.

01:10:52.035 --> 01:10:56.598
Hey guys, what's going on?
Hey, you guys copy?

01:11:02.210 --> 01:11:06.807
Radio silence means don't talk,
unless talking is necessary.

01:11:07.617 --> 01:11:09.741
Okay.
Sorry, sheriff.

01:11:11.043 --> 01:11:12.243
Over.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.547
Wake me
when it's over.

01:11:17.025 --> 01:11:20.624
You're on duty.
Lazy.

01:11:21.529 --> 01:11:24.021
Sorry, boss, I didn't know
I was on the pay-roll.

01:11:27.101 --> 01:11:28.835
I have to take a leak.

01:11:32.138 --> 01:11:34.601
I have a big wiesel,
crab another one.

01:11:34.608 --> 01:11:36.308
- Yeah, okay.
- I'll be back in minute.

01:11:36.309 --> 01:11:38.504
Go.
Here take this.

01:11:38.911 --> 01:11:40.875
- I don't need no gun.
- Yes you do.

01:11:40.876 --> 01:11:43.877
Go ahead take it. You know I'll be okay,
don't be such a baby.

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:45.414
Alright.

01:11:46.985 --> 01:11:48.544
Hang tied.

01:12:05.602 --> 01:12:07.667
Come on,
you lonely boy.

01:12:53.014 --> 01:12:54.477
What shall we do?

01:12:55.416 --> 01:12:57.984
I need a good stiff drink.

01:14:05.015 --> 01:14:07.416
- Hello.
- Hello, you're looking good.

01:14:07.417 --> 01:14:08.517
Mister.

01:14:11.121 --> 01:14:13.588
They call me Mr. Happy.

01:14:14.389 --> 01:14:21.854
Well, what can we do for such a
handsome fellow, on such sludgy night?

01:14:24.401 --> 01:14:26.391
Come on!

01:14:30.139 --> 01:14:31.804
Come on.

01:14:39.906 --> 01:14:41.206
Oh, yeah.

01:14:44.856 --> 01:14:46.882
Well, let's go fuck!

01:14:48.184 --> 01:14:51.384
Scream!
Scream, scream.

01:14:57.901 --> 01:15:00.891
Let's fuck!

01:15:05.406 --> 01:15:08.501
- Come here, please!
- I'm coming!

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.012
Oh, my God!

01:15:39.439 --> 01:15:43.205
Come out from under there,
or do I have to drag you out?

01:15:48.248 --> 01:15:50.148
That wasn't necessary,
now was it?

01:15:50.150 --> 01:15:55.212
I'm gonna say this once: I don't wanna
see you anywhere near my Amy.

01:15:55.422 --> 01:15:59.146
If I do,
all hell will break loose.

01:16:02.463 --> 01:16:05.161
There must be some sort
of misunderstanding, sir.

01:16:05.598 --> 01:16:07.226
I wouldn't bring your daughter any harm.

01:16:07.735 --> 01:16:11.534
Eerlijk gezegd, kan het me
niet schelen wat het is.

01:16:11.971 --> 01:16:15.034
Anywhere,
I mean anywhere...

01:16:15.475 --> 01:16:19.978
intends about my daughter,
we need to get this.

01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:26.909
You would just be like,
shit at the bottom of my boot.

01:16:27.419 --> 01:16:28.718
You get it?

01:16:30.623 --> 01:16:32.353
Stay away from Amy.

01:16:33.927 --> 01:16:37.663
I'm sorry if I'm als ik dwars lig,
but all I'm trying to tell you...

01:16:39.498 --> 01:16:41.556
Ik denk niet dat je me begrijpt.

01:16:42.834 --> 01:16:44.860
I don't wanna see you
anywhere near Amy.

01:16:47.205 --> 01:16:48.631
If I do...

01:16:49.142 --> 01:16:51.309
you will need medical attention.

01:17:00.618 --> 01:17:03.747
Ik weet niet hoe ik moet
reageren op je bedreiging.

01:17:03.755 --> 01:17:07.092
Consider this a warning,
not a threat.

01:17:08.694 --> 01:17:11.220
I know a lotta people
all over this town...

01:17:12.563 --> 01:17:14.693
who'll make your life
a living hell.

01:17:17.469 --> 01:17:20.002
As you lived in hell.

01:17:24.977 --> 01:17:27.105
My life already is hell.

01:17:30.816 --> 01:17:34.013
We don't like trouble
in this town, son.

01:17:35.052 --> 01:17:36.945
I'll be watching you.

01:17:43.195 --> 01:17:46.759
Don't give me that face, bitch,
I'll come back there and kick your ass.

01:18:12.879 --> 01:18:14.544
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:18:19.887 --> 01:18:21.218
Have we met before?

01:18:28.062 --> 01:18:30.493
You see any connection
between these two?

01:18:30.494 --> 01:18:32.294
Who are you?

01:18:32.399 --> 01:18:36.859
Just, uh... somebody which you probably
gonna wanna trade any information with.

01:18:36.871 --> 01:18:41.799
That is if, you finely figure out
what it is you're up against.

01:18:41.909 --> 01:18:44.541
What does that mean?
And who the hell are you?

01:18:49.649 --> 01:18:53.348
Is there any reason
for you to be here, Mister...

01:19:00.827 --> 01:19:04.025
- Thibodeux?
- Thibodeaux.

01:19:04.064 --> 01:19:08.198
So, uh... you give me a call
if you feel a need.

01:19:08.302 --> 01:19:11.937
Anyway...
you will feel a need.

01:19:18.911 --> 01:19:20.501
Good bye.

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:37.092
- Hello?
- John, yeah, um...

01:19:38.399 --> 01:19:41.158
I need you over here,
at my office.

01:19:41.159 --> 01:19:42.159
Hey, Paulie.

01:19:45.803 --> 01:19:47.265
What's going on, Sam?

01:19:47.471 --> 01:19:51.566
I like to tell you exactly,
what you saw at the ruins.

01:19:56.293 --> 01:19:57.859
Hey what's up?

01:19:59.885 --> 01:20:02.012
- How we doing?
- It's a go.

01:20:04.488 --> 01:20:05.981
We're all ears.

01:20:06.692 --> 01:20:08.423
Well...

01:20:08.893 --> 01:20:11.826
it all started down in Louisiana.

01:20:11.927 --> 01:20:16.928
There was this killing, I mean,
ugly and brutal, with no reason.

01:20:17.768 --> 01:20:22.605
No... motives
and no suspects.

01:20:23.241 --> 01:20:31.174
The police had this corpse...
it was, uh... in a million pieces.

01:20:31.183 --> 01:20:38.120
Was a... female, mid 30's,
a mom with a little boy name Dan.

01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:43.224
The killing had taken place
in the family residence.

01:20:44.694 --> 01:20:51.464
The, uh... father James Bender,
was the only suspect.

01:20:52.602 --> 01:20:55.839
Never once did he deny
he hadn't done it.

01:20:57.307 --> 01:21:01.805
Never once did he admit
he ain't done it.

01:21:02.812 --> 01:21:07.275
They arrested him,
about 3 days later in some bar.

01:21:07.550 --> 01:21:12.015
They had him in custody...
for about, oh, 3 weeks,

01:21:12.016 --> 01:21:15.617
before they called me in
to join them.

01:21:17.593 --> 01:21:20.291
Then I checked all
the evidence they had.

01:21:21.196 --> 01:21:25.224
Looked at the coroners
report.

01:21:25.235 --> 01:21:28.864
I ask around, but, uh...
since I saw I was gettin' nowhere...

01:21:28.873 --> 01:21:32.665
I decided to...
well, I'll check the newspapers,

01:21:32.675 --> 01:21:36.640
as I kept checking newspapers,
hm... to my surprise...

01:21:36.641 --> 01:21:39.541
murders with the same M-O,
had been going on...

01:21:39.542 --> 01:21:43.843
all over the city,
for years and years.

01:21:44.487 --> 01:21:49.556
Even the cops don't all believe
Bender killed his wife intirely.

01:21:49.858 --> 01:21:50.824
So...

01:21:51.225 --> 01:21:54.825
I knew there had to be
more to it.

01:21:55.063 --> 01:22:00.063
There's a written assessment
of you're, uh... so called character.

01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:02.771
I gotta tell you,
it ain't to great.

01:22:03.372 --> 01:22:07.308
But, uh... still it is theoretic,
all those people missed something,

01:22:07.309 --> 01:22:09.309
what do you think,
am I right?

01:22:09.343 --> 01:22:13.481
You can, uh... take that assessment
and stick it up your ass!

01:22:15.683 --> 01:22:21.186
You ain't got shit me, and, uh...
well, let's say you had...

01:22:21.424 --> 01:22:22.425
I...

01:22:25.726 --> 01:22:28.258
I'd still tell you
go fuck yourself!

01:22:31.231 --> 01:22:34.098
You listen to me,
you little shit!

01:22:34.568 --> 01:22:36.794
You wanna be a tough guy,
huh?

01:22:36.904 --> 01:22:39.635
You be a tough,
I don't care.

01:22:42.142 --> 01:22:45.439
I'm not gonna kill you
if ever talk to me like that again,

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:48.040
I will cripple you.

01:22:50.451 --> 01:22:53.910
So...
Did you kill your wife?

01:22:55.088 --> 01:22:56.117
Did I?

01:22:58.858 --> 01:23:02.787
Come on, you don't wanna
make this hard on me.

01:23:02.828 --> 01:23:06.488
Because you're gonna be the one
that has to pay.

01:23:08.568 --> 01:23:10.469
You know what?

01:23:11.170 --> 01:23:14.496
Let's step outside
be the only way I'd think of...

01:23:15.141 --> 01:23:16.942
just for a second...

01:23:19.844 --> 01:23:21.636
and there's your answer.

01:23:22.982 --> 01:23:24.282
Right...

01:23:24.283 --> 01:23:26.217
right fuckin' there.

01:23:27.954 --> 01:23:30.251
There ain't much else
I can tell you.

01:23:31.325 --> 01:23:36.457
You enjoy your nice...
long... stay here, huh?

01:23:38.564 --> 01:23:40.494
See you next weekend.

01:23:41.266 --> 01:23:48.502
Maybe I'll, uh... stop by your place,
give my regards to your wife.

01:24:16.768 --> 01:24:20.559
You thought I forget you could hide here
but I never forget.

01:24:20.671 --> 01:24:22.701
You're my mama now.

01:24:23.007 --> 01:24:24.307
Sunny?

01:24:24.310 --> 01:24:26.138
Now you're my mother.

01:24:26.139 --> 01:24:27.139
Help!

01:24:27.645 --> 01:24:29.040
Sunny?

01:24:29.714 --> 01:24:31.775
Where are you?

01:24:32.916 --> 01:24:35.684
Goddamn!
No, damn-it!

01:24:35.885 --> 01:24:36.985
Help!

01:24:40.556 --> 01:24:42.685
Honey, I'm so sorry.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.825
You son of bitch...

01:24:53.170 --> 01:24:57.237
Bender did it...
oh, I knew it...

01:24:57.509 --> 01:25:00.374
but, uh...
nobody would believe me.

01:25:00.576 --> 01:25:03.972
I went down to the jail to check,
sure enough...

01:25:03.973 --> 01:25:07.274
Bender had, uh...
escaped the night before...

01:25:07.283 --> 01:25:10.111
and the bars
were all twisted up.

01:25:10.386 --> 01:25:13.618
I mean, no mere human
could've done that.

01:25:14.055 --> 01:25:15.991
The slayings' that's around here...

01:25:16.492 --> 01:25:22.193
Benders M-O exactly.
That son of a bitch is here, right now!

01:25:22.194 --> 01:25:24.595
This I'm certain.

01:25:25.202 --> 01:25:26.830
He gotta be stopped.

01:25:27.436 --> 01:25:29.662
Tell him what you saw
at the ranch.

01:25:33.976 --> 01:25:35.403
He was a wolf.

01:25:37.513 --> 01:25:40.276
A big-ass wolf,
a huge head.

01:25:40.515 --> 01:25:45.417
He walked like, you and me.
I looked right in his eyes.

01:25:46.087 --> 01:25:50.014
I looked in his eyes...
and I thought...

01:25:51.061 --> 01:25:53.484
it's that kid.

01:25:54.363 --> 01:25:56.257
- Take care.
- See you later!

01:25:56.265 --> 01:25:58.926
- Think abaut what I told.
- I see you.

01:26:00.301 --> 01:26:02.501
- Goodbye, John.
- Bye now.

01:26:22.657 --> 01:26:24.553
Drive save.

01:26:43.711 --> 01:26:46.975
Listen to me,
you cunt.

01:26:51.452 --> 01:26:53.253
Yeah...

01:26:55.154 --> 01:26:59.523
This is family-shit, yeah?

01:27:00.026 --> 01:27:02.395
Stay the fuck out of it.

01:27:03.330 --> 01:27:11.097
That shit you cleaned up on the highway
was... well, that was child-play.

01:27:11.604 --> 01:27:15.872
And the brothel that was my...
fucking pleasure.

01:27:21.247 --> 01:27:25.915
Drop it, or I will bring this
whole fucking town in pain.

01:27:26.717 --> 01:27:31.852
And you...
I will bring down... on you.

01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:39.222
Come to papa,
you taste good.

01:27:39.431 --> 01:27:42.399
You make me
fuckin' hungry!

01:28:11.964 --> 01:28:13.321
Ma'am.

01:28:20.823 --> 01:28:22.023
Hey...

01:28:25.043 --> 01:28:28.271
I wanna let to know, that I wanna
be here for you for everything.

01:28:30.948 --> 01:28:32.481
Forever.

01:28:33.983 --> 01:28:35.183
Okay?

01:29:02.679 --> 01:29:04.276
Amy, I think
you better go.

01:29:04.446 --> 01:29:07.241
Don't leave
on account me, honey.

01:29:08.042 --> 01:29:09.342
Yeah...

01:29:09.719 --> 01:29:13.253
I like a company of...
beautiful woman.

01:29:13.357 --> 01:29:15.450
Amy, wait in the car.

01:29:20.964 --> 01:29:24.461
Yeah... I wouldn't mind
that fuckin' ass.

01:29:28.437 --> 01:29:30.264
So?

01:29:31.374 --> 01:29:33.604
How you doin', little man?

01:29:33.608 --> 01:29:37.370
- Who the fuck are you?
- The question is: Who the fuck are you?

01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:40.511
I'm somebody
who doesn't appreciate stranger.

01:29:47.356 --> 01:29:48.850
Well...

01:29:50.025 --> 01:29:52.823
even strangers share secrets,
you know that?

01:29:53.427 --> 01:29:56.525
Sometimes even
if you have same power.

01:29:57.867 --> 01:30:02.800
I began sharing with others,
only themselves.

01:30:02.905 --> 01:30:07.538
Aren't we just, uh...
the luckiest bastards you've ever seen?

01:30:08.276 --> 01:30:09.766
Lucky?

01:30:10.579 --> 01:30:12.206
It's a nightmare.

01:30:19.054 --> 01:30:20.811
Nightmare?

01:30:21.555 --> 01:30:23.012
You're fuckin' kidding me.

01:30:23.024 --> 01:30:26.850
Take a look around,
look at this cattle.

01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:29.225
They're clueless.

01:30:29.531 --> 01:30:33.666
Sittin' in front of their TV,
and their computer...

01:30:33.734 --> 01:30:36.660
numbin' themselves to life.

01:30:40.207 --> 01:30:42.273
Instead of, uh...

01:30:44.911 --> 01:30:49.171
well, denying themselves...

01:30:49.183 --> 01:30:51.408
exactly what they really wanna do.

01:30:51.619 --> 01:30:55.285
And that is doing exactly
what you wanna do.

01:30:56.022 --> 01:31:00.224
Any time,
living outside of all of this.

01:31:01.995 --> 01:31:05.460
That's what it's about,
and that's liberatin'.

01:31:08.601 --> 01:31:10.391
Liberating, huh?

01:31:14.473 --> 01:31:17.575
Well, that must've been...
liberating, to...

01:31:19.679 --> 01:31:21.575
kill your wife...

01:31:23.449 --> 01:31:25.642
abandon your son...

01:31:27.921 --> 01:31:30.815
and hide out
from the rest of the world?

01:31:35.395 --> 01:31:36.754
I, uh...

01:31:37.364 --> 01:31:42.097
know my words are hitting home.
I know you feel 'em.

01:31:44.169 --> 01:31:48.168
Don't fight it.
Enjoy it.

01:31:50.274 --> 01:31:56.244
Have beautiful women, kill mercilessly.
That is your right.

01:31:56.449 --> 01:32:00.844
And no doubt pass it on to your loved ones
you sick son of a bitch!

01:32:00.853 --> 01:32:03.880
You just don't get it,
do you?

01:32:03.888 --> 01:32:07.114
We, uh... walk the earth,
filled with power...

01:32:08.527 --> 01:32:10.527
walk in our own path.

01:32:12.163 --> 01:32:14.831
- How did you find me?
- I just followed distant links.

01:32:14.832 --> 01:32:17.233
It's real easy.

01:32:21.039 --> 01:32:22.762
You're jung.

01:32:24.509 --> 01:32:28.370
You have not realised
your full potential yet.

01:32:28.913 --> 01:32:31.643
And needs...
this...

01:32:32.217 --> 01:32:35.847
this...
is the cattle you feed on.

01:32:39.322 --> 01:32:44.652
The taste of human
is just so much more sweeter.

01:32:46.663 --> 01:32:50.324
You will realise that,
sooner or later.

01:32:53.504 --> 01:32:55.435
Bingo!

01:33:06.216 --> 01:33:08.211
You're a funny guy.

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:13.754
But you know what?
I think I get what you're sayin'.

01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:19.455
Because I just... I just had
a liberating moment myself.

01:33:21.998 --> 01:33:23.688
I just realised...

01:33:25.368 --> 01:33:27.657
that I'm nothing like you.

01:33:29.271 --> 01:33:32.369
And I'll never be anything
like you.

01:33:32.509 --> 01:33:35.004
You're a piece of shit!

01:33:49.825 --> 01:33:52.823
Blood is thicker than water.

01:33:56.825 --> 01:33:57.725
Listen!

01:34:01.268 --> 01:34:04.164
Fucking listen to me.

01:34:04.707 --> 01:34:06.968
You are my son.

01:34:10.713 --> 01:34:13.211
And don't you ever forget it.

01:34:14.749 --> 01:34:17.440
There's a storm brewing.

01:34:19.021 --> 01:34:21.611
And it's coming down heavy.

01:34:24.158 --> 01:34:26.650
You gotta reliese,
what side of the fence you're on.

01:34:26.651 --> 01:34:28.552
Yeah, whats that mean?

01:34:29.664 --> 01:34:31.725
Just what it is.

01:34:35.438 --> 01:34:37.395
When I go now.

01:34:38.140 --> 01:34:41.805
It's people to see
and places to go.

01:34:45.379 --> 01:34:47.903
Good taste in woman.

01:34:49.149 --> 01:34:51.746
There's hope for you yet.

01:34:55.257 --> 01:34:57.915
You ever go near her...

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:01.022
and I'll fucking kill you.

01:35:01.928 --> 01:35:03.993
Remember that.

01:35:12.239 --> 01:35:14.467
Now, get the fuck outta here.

01:35:27.853 --> 01:35:34.389
Ladies and Gents,
I saw a werewolf in Trader Vic's...

01:35:34.393 --> 01:35:37.357
drinking a pina colada.

01:35:37.563 --> 01:35:42.762
and his hair was perfect.

01:35:52.079 --> 01:35:54.372
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:36:58.442 --> 01:37:00.508
Where have you been,
stranger?

01:37:00.510 --> 01:37:02.610
We haven't seen you
in like...

01:37:02.912 --> 01:37:04.504
so long.

01:37:04.748 --> 01:37:06.539
Saw any action yet?

01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:10.178
- Amy?
- What the fuck you think you're lookin' at?

01:37:10.187 --> 01:37:12.978
- I'm lookin' at shit.
- What the fuck did you say?

01:37:15.658 --> 01:37:17.824
Why don't you get outta the car,
you little fag?

01:37:17.828 --> 01:37:19.326
Get outta the fucking car!

01:37:21.864 --> 01:37:23.890
Hey, what the fuck was that?
- Fuck off!

01:37:23.901 --> 01:37:25.291
Good, let's go in here
lovebird.

01:37:25.292 --> 01:37:26.691
- Come here.
- Get the fuck...

01:37:27.092 --> 01:37:28.193
outta the car!

01:37:28.237 --> 01:37:29.971
Hey, don't be like that.

01:37:31.141 --> 01:37:32.599
- What is going on?
- Get outta the car!

01:37:32.701 --> 01:37:33.901
Some people like it...

01:37:34.544 --> 01:37:36.071
- Stop!
- Come on!

01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:37.907
Come on, let's fucking do it!

01:37:53.196 --> 01:37:54.628
Stop it!

01:38:03.705 --> 01:38:04.668
Let's go

01:38:05.812 --> 01:38:06.941
Get in the car.

01:38:42.479 --> 01:38:43.679
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:45.080
Hey.

01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:48.771
I tough I've told you
to stay away from that kid.

01:38:49.382 --> 01:38:52.417
I like to ask you, did he...
did he hurt you?

01:38:52.421 --> 01:38:55.547
- Dad, you dont understand.
- No, you dont understand.

01:38:55.755 --> 01:38:57.956
He's not what you think he is.

01:38:57.959 --> 01:39:00.526
He's dangerous. Sam's been telling me
things about him you wouldn't believe.

01:39:00.561 --> 01:39:03.152
Dad, I know all about him,
he wouldn't hurt me.

01:39:03.164 --> 01:39:04.391
What's this?

01:39:04.398 --> 01:39:06.959
If he's so dangerous, then why
doesn't she arrest him herself?

01:39:06.966 --> 01:39:09.964
She will, she will.
If somebody doesn't get to him first.

01:39:09.969 --> 01:39:13.605
You're wrong,
you don't know him the way I do.

01:39:13.606 --> 01:39:15.138
I love him.

01:39:16.209 --> 01:39:18.870
The way you used to love mom.

01:39:20.914 --> 01:39:22.575
I hate you!

01:39:23.851 --> 01:39:24.918
Amy!

01:39:38.665 --> 01:39:40.828
Amy!
Amy!

01:39:40.833 --> 01:39:42.700
Come back!

01:40:26.077 --> 01:40:27.642
Hé, gladjanus.

01:40:28.547 --> 01:40:31.374
You and me
a little chat.

01:40:31.782 --> 01:40:33.940
Not here,
but in the sheriffs office.

01:40:33.950 --> 01:40:36.345
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:40:37.246 --> 01:40:38.447
Uh...

01:40:39.625 --> 01:40:41.953
Really isn't much to talk about now,
is there?

01:40:43.428 --> 01:40:45.322
What about this?

01:40:46.996 --> 01:40:50.594
I know who you are...
and what you are.

01:40:52.402 --> 01:40:55.800
I know that you're responsible
for what's been going on around here.

01:40:56.007 --> 01:40:58.272
I want you to come with me.

01:41:00.710 --> 01:41:04.678
By will, or by force.
You make the choice.

01:41:07.850 --> 01:41:10.015
You listenin' me?

01:41:11.655 --> 01:41:13.120
Yeah, I'm listenin'.

01:41:13.857 --> 01:41:16.252
I surely don't don't care.

01:41:18.128 --> 01:41:19.818
How about this, huh?

01:41:19.829 --> 01:41:22.656
You care about it now?
I bet you do.

01:41:23.799 --> 01:41:27.235
I did my best to run you off,
to keep you away from my daugther Amy.

01:41:27.337 --> 01:41:29.664
But you kept coming around.

01:41:29.706 --> 01:41:30.807
Now here we are.

01:41:30.808 --> 01:41:33.809
You gonna kill me
for loving you daughter, John?

01:41:39.948 --> 01:41:43.214
- You about ready to end a world of hurt.
- For what, John?

01:41:43.215 --> 01:41:44.215
Huh?

01:41:45.554 --> 01:41:47.884
I love Amy, I told you that.

01:41:49.124 --> 01:41:52.393
And I won't let anyone hurt her,
not even you.

01:41:58.501 --> 01:42:01.567
I feel sorry for you, John.
I really do.

01:42:03.839 --> 01:42:08.239
You wanna shoot me, John.
Go ahead, fuckin' kill me.

01:42:10.578 --> 01:42:13.176
'Cause I really don't care.

01:42:14.917 --> 01:42:19.781
The fact is, I wake up most mornings
wishing I never did.

01:42:20.188 --> 01:42:22.348
Come on, pull the trigger!

01:42:24.526 --> 01:42:28.386
The truth is,
Amy and I love each other, John.

01:42:29.597 --> 01:42:32.699
You can never
take that away from me.

01:42:39.507 --> 01:42:43.268
Well, John?
What're you waitin' for?

01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:49.445
- That ain't the question.
- Do it! Do it!

01:42:52.787 --> 01:42:54.617
The hell with it!

01:43:13.773 --> 01:43:15.440
So, now what?

01:43:16.711 --> 01:43:18.802
You're coming with me.

01:43:19.479 --> 01:43:21.274
We're gonna talk to a friend of mine.

01:43:32.592 --> 01:43:34.656
Hello, girlfriend.

01:43:45.739 --> 01:43:48.774
I said:
You're gonna be my girlfriend.

01:43:52.712 --> 01:43:54.674
I'm here to see Sam.

01:43:55.015 --> 01:43:56.479
Thanks.

01:43:57.483 --> 01:44:00.746
So, you don't think
it's a random incident?

01:44:00.753 --> 01:44:03.021
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey.

01:44:03.721 --> 01:44:05.949
I see you got your man.

01:44:09.150 --> 01:44:11.351
Jesus Christ.

01:44:11.598 --> 01:44:13.927
You look just like him.

01:44:13.932 --> 01:44:16.431
I have no idea
what's going on anymore.

01:44:16.435 --> 01:44:18.499
I figured, I bring him in,
you'd figure it out.

01:44:18.900 --> 01:44:21.101
I think that we have
went wrong.

01:44:21.205 --> 01:44:26.338
See over here... the red spots
are his old man...

01:44:26.345 --> 01:44:29.604
and this blue ones,
are Junior here.

01:44:29.613 --> 01:44:32.083
Correct me if I wrong you, kid?

01:44:37.956 --> 01:44:39.887
Yeah, I guess so.

01:44:40.624 --> 01:44:43.593
- Well done.
- That's my job.

01:44:43.695 --> 01:44:48.327
These ones in Mexico though...
never been there.

01:44:52.236 --> 01:44:53.860
What the hell's she talkin' about?

01:44:53.871 --> 01:44:59.299
You see, Sam and I grossed reference
to all the unsolved murders with the, uh...

01:44:59.309 --> 01:45:03.640
strange animal deaths, it gave us
a road-map that there were...

01:45:03.648 --> 01:45:06.139
two differned killers.

01:45:06.551 --> 01:45:09.210
He's father did the murders.

01:45:09.953 --> 01:45:13.982
Hey, you know, until a couple
of days ago, I had no idea...

01:45:14.090 --> 01:45:17.820
that there were two of you,
until you mentioned the kid, then bing...

01:45:17.827 --> 01:45:20.562
like a light-bulb went off
over my head.

01:45:21.130 --> 01:45:23.298
What, his father?

01:45:23.666 --> 01:45:26.826
You kill the life-stock and...
your father's killing the humans?

01:45:26.837 --> 01:45:31.941
Looks like it, John. Bender Sr.
has been very busy around here and, uh...

01:45:32.242 --> 01:45:35.175
Dan too, haven't you Dan?

01:45:35.412 --> 01:45:36.908
I know.

01:45:37.548 --> 01:45:40.714
Can you control yourself
when you're like that, or?

01:45:42.685 --> 01:45:47.117
I saw you on the ridge, John.
I knew who you were.

01:45:50.826 --> 01:45:54.593
The only reason you're still breathing,
is 'cause of me.

01:45:54.730 --> 01:45:56.561
Yeah?
Get your ass from that chair.

01:45:56.562 --> 01:45:57.962
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Come on, Come on!

01:45:57.967 --> 01:46:03.104
The only thing not to be blunt,
is to kill this kids dad.

01:46:03.438 --> 01:46:06.736
Bender has got to be stopped.

01:46:12.114 --> 01:46:13.841
Sheriff Pantoja.

01:46:14.181 --> 01:46:16.873
Let me talk
to that stupid ass, Thibodeaux.

01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:20.651
I think its for you.

01:46:26.629 --> 01:46:27.565
Hello?

01:46:27.566 --> 01:46:31.166
Hey Ribcage, it's been a while.
How' everything?

01:46:31.432 --> 01:46:35.195
I always knew were here,
you big fuck.

01:46:35.202 --> 01:46:38.236
You and I got
some unfinished business.

01:46:38.674 --> 01:46:40.503
Oh, yes, we do.

01:46:41.041 --> 01:46:43.169
Grab your girlfriend
and let's go.

01:46:43.278 --> 01:46:45.312
You just pick the spot.

01:46:45.846 --> 01:46:50.849
The ruins. The sheriff will know
where that is. Around 10:30 or so.

01:46:51.252 --> 01:46:55.655
And tell the pretty-boy:
I got your Amy for tonight.

01:46:55.657 --> 01:46:57.950
Have yourself a great day.

01:47:01.428 --> 01:47:03.823
It's the ruins, 10:30.

01:47:05.365 --> 01:47:09.058
John, he's holding your dauhter.

01:47:09.670 --> 01:47:12.430
- I'm gonna kill that mother-fucker!
- Sam...

01:47:14.274 --> 01:47:16.502
we have to talk in private.

01:47:23.716 --> 01:47:25.978
I can't loose her, Sam.

01:47:30.323 --> 01:47:31.757
You won't.

01:47:34.726 --> 01:47:37.225
You won't loose her,
I promise.

01:47:39.199 --> 01:47:41.288
We're going to bring her home.

01:48:25.443 --> 01:48:27.669
Zullen we gaan, guys.

01:48:28.979 --> 01:48:30.574
Alright then.

01:48:31.783 --> 01:48:34.211
Let's go rotzooi kick some ass right here.

01:48:34.953 --> 01:48:37.920
- Lets get it over with.
- Follow me.

01:48:45.963 --> 01:48:47.925
Well look who's here.

01:48:49.166 --> 01:48:50.734
Brother Louie.

01:48:55.606 --> 01:48:58.198
Let's go kill some shit.

01:49:00.811 --> 01:49:02.376
Let's get him.

01:49:14.257 --> 01:49:16.248
Where is my daughter,
you piece of shit?

01:49:16.492 --> 01:49:18.493
Is this home?

01:49:21.797 --> 01:49:23.832
Look around.

01:49:24.167 --> 01:49:27.366
Look at this place.
Good friends...

01:49:29.173 --> 01:49:30.831
family.

01:49:35.078 --> 01:49:37.103
What you gonna do with that?

01:49:37.614 --> 01:49:39.407
Pea shooter?

01:49:39.416 --> 01:49:41.810
You, gonna...
you gonna shoot me?

01:49:42.584 --> 01:49:44.145
Calm down, John.

01:49:46.256 --> 01:49:47.852
Enough!

01:49:49.725 --> 01:49:53.161
This is between you and me!
Where is Amy?

01:49:53.763 --> 01:49:55.028
Amy who?

01:49:55.031 --> 01:49:57.096
Fuck you!
Where is she?

01:49:57.333 --> 01:50:00.597
Fuck you, back!
Harder

01:50:01.236 --> 01:50:02.999
No more games.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000
Right.

01:50:06.309 --> 01:50:07.831
No more games.

01:50:08.209 --> 01:50:10.043
That's it, let's go.

01:50:12.013 --> 01:50:13.837
It's always been between
you and me.

01:50:16.451 --> 01:50:18.852
Wanna be a cowboy, ride this!

01:50:28.130 --> 01:50:31.364
This where it ends,
mother-fucker!
