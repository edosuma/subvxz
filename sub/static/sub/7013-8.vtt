00:15.648 --> 00:17.946
I love this ring.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.486
I wish we could tell people
that we're engaged.

00:20.553 --> 00:23.522
You know, without Red killing you.

00:23.590 --> 00:26.559
Red kills happy things.
It's what he does.

00:27.694 --> 00:30.629
Let's just enjoy the fact
that someday...

00:30.697 --> 00:33.427
you are going to be Mrs. Forman.

00:37.303 --> 00:39.237
Mrs. Forman?
( Laughs )

00:39.305 --> 00:41.296
You want me to go by Mrs. Forman?

00:41.374 --> 00:44.969
Well, yeah, I just assumed.
I mean, come on.

00:45.045 --> 00:47.479
( Laughing )
Pinciotti?

00:49.549 --> 00:53.451
- Which is nice. No. Which is really nice.
- <i>( Kitty ) Eric?</i>

00:53.520 --> 00:56.148
Eric? Honey...

00:56.222 --> 00:59.282
could you get the Thanksgiving turkey
out of the freezer?

00:59.359 --> 01:02.851
Oh, wait. It's a 20-pounder.
Donna.

01:02.929 --> 01:06.558
Could you get the Thanksgiving turkey
out of the freezer?

01:06.633 --> 01:08.658
Sure, Mrs. Forman.

01:10.303 --> 01:12.396
See? There's your Mrs. Forman.

01:12.472 --> 01:15.032
Okay. Yeah, you know-
( Clears Throat ) you're right.

01:15.108 --> 01:17.042
That's gonna be a little creepy.

01:17.110 --> 01:21.911
Well, now I kinda like it.
Call me Mrs. Forman.

01:21.981 --> 01:25.940
- No.
- Mrs. Forman's feeling dirty.

01:26.019 --> 01:29.511
- Okay, Donna-
- Come on. Give Mrs. Forman a big French kiss!

01:29.589 --> 01:31.580

Okay. Perfect.
We're all set for turkey day.

02:15.368 --> 02:19.134
And there'll be plenty of room,
especially without Laurie.

02:19.205 --> 02:21.605
Has anyone heard from her?
Of course not!

02:21.674 --> 02:24.438
I guess respect and courtesy
aren't genetic like...

02:24.511 --> 02:26.843
my slim hips.

02:28.448 --> 02:31.940
Hey, Schotzie, stay away
from my witch sister.

02:32.018 --> 02:35.579
Her and her witch friends have been known
to sacrifice small animals.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.853
Oh, and possibly
that one asthmatic neighbor boy.

02:41.361 --> 02:43.488
Eric, little Wally moved away.

02:43.563 --> 02:45.827
A six-year-old moved away?

02:47.333 --> 02:50.166
His parents
still live in that house.

02:50.236 --> 02:53.262
Mrs. Forman, if it helps,
I can inviteJackie to Thanksgiving.

02:53.339 --> 02:56.172
She's bitchy like Laurie.

02:56.242 --> 02:59.302
Mrs. Forman, I would love to come
to your Thanksgiving dinner...

02:59.379 --> 03:02.314
and I'll bring a date and a
1 2-pack just like the pilgrims.

03:09.956 --> 03:13.392
Hey, guys. Red is gonna flip
when he sees this failing notice.

03:13.459 --> 03:16.360
''To the parent or guardian
of Eric Forman.''

03:16.429 --> 03:18.420
Your son is a complete idiot.

03:23.670 --> 03:27.936
Please kick him out
and raise the foreign boy as your own.

03:30.143 --> 03:33.010
Man, all I did was mess up
on two math quizzes...

03:33.079 --> 03:35.172
but Ms. McGee has to be all-

03:35.248 --> 03:38.217
( Whining ) I'm Ms. McGee.
I wear high heels and fail everybody.

03:39.485 --> 03:41.953
What's that?

03:42.021 --> 03:43.989
That's Ms. McGee.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.787
You hardly changed your voice.

03:48.361 --> 03:50.795
Well, sure, I did.
( Whining ) I'm Ms. McGee.

03:50.863 --> 03:52.797
That's just your voice.

03:54.200 --> 03:58.534
- I'm doing an impression.
- Well, you suck at impressions.

03:58.605 --> 04:01.665
- Okay. Forget it.
- Are you still doing her?

04:02.909 --> 04:05.969
Oh, hey, Red.
Do me a favor. Sign this, huh?

04:06.045 --> 04:08.275
My gym teacher's failing me
'cause I won't wear shorts.

04:08.348 --> 04:11.442
- Why won't you wear shorts?
- Would you wear shorts?

04:11.517 --> 04:13.815
Fine.

04:15.521 --> 04:18.978
- Thank you.
- So, Eric. How's school treating you?

04:19.058 --> 04:22.585
You managing to, uh, keep
from embarrassing yourself?

04:22.662 --> 04:25.790
Yeah. Oh, sure. I've been
buckling down just like you said...

04:25.865 --> 04:28.231
and thinking a little bit
more about my future...

04:28.301 --> 04:30.667
which I believe
you also recommended.

04:31.671 --> 04:33.798
Well, it's good to know...

04:33.873 --> 04:38.572
that 1 7 years of kicking your ass
has finally paid off.

04:41.914 --> 04:44.212
Eric, you didn't have him
sign your failing notice.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.014
Oh, I don't wanna
trouble him with this old thing.

04:47.086 --> 04:50.522
I'll just sign his name
myself, because...

04:50.590 --> 04:53.684
that's how good a son I am.

04:59.766 --> 05:01.700
Okay, careful. Careful.
Watch the TV.

05:01.768 --> 05:03.929
Okay, this is good.
Perfect. Perfect.

05:05.905 --> 05:08.430
You. Why are you here?

05:10.276 --> 05:13.336
You don't even know
what Thanksgiving is.

05:14.847 --> 05:17.975
I'm here because my host parents
are feeding bums at church.

05:19.686 --> 05:22.120
Charity begins at home, my ass.

05:28.461 --> 05:31.760
- Laurie.
- Hey, little brother.

05:31.831 --> 05:35.528
You're back. And you're not
even eight months pregnant.

05:37.236 --> 05:39.363
- Mommy!
- <i>Laurie.!</i>

05:39.439 --> 05:43.102
( Laughs ) Oh, my goodness!
I knew you'd come.

05:43.176 --> 05:47.772
- Hi, Daddy!
- All the phones broken in Chicago?

05:47.847 --> 05:50.213
No. Well, see, I had other plans...

05:50.283 --> 05:52.808
but my date-
I mean, business associate-

05:52.885 --> 05:54.819
had to go be with his wife.

05:54.887 --> 05:57.481
I mean, other business associate.

05:57.557 --> 05:59.548
I'm doin' good!

05:59.625 --> 06:01.593
Okay, well, you know what?

06:01.661 --> 06:04.687
I'm gonna set you a place
right next to me at the big table.

06:04.764 --> 06:07.597
No, Kitty.
I think that seat belongs to Eric.

06:07.667 --> 06:10.568
Me? At the adults' table?

06:14.340 --> 06:16.570
Are you sure I'm ready?

06:16.642 --> 06:19.076
- But, Daddy-
- Maybe before you leave...

06:19.145 --> 06:21.306
you'll be acting
a little more like him.

06:24.450 --> 06:27.476
Yeah!
( Laughing )

06:27.553 --> 06:30.522
I'm the favorite now. Ooh!

Taste that.

06:38.831 --> 06:41.425
Pimp gave ya the holiday off, huh?

06:43.836 --> 06:46.669
Yeah. He replaced me with your mom.

06:48.674 --> 06:50.835
Now it's Thanksgiving.

06:53.546 --> 06:55.480
Hey, Donna.

06:55.548 --> 06:57.482
You know how my dad's proud of me...

06:57.550 --> 07:00.747
- for doing so well in school?
- Even though it's a lie, and you're failing math...

07:00.820 --> 07:03.687
- 'cause you spend all your time with me?
- Yeah. Right. That's-

07:03.756 --> 07:07.123
That's right. Well,just now, right now,
right in there, right now...

07:07.193 --> 07:10.754
Red asked <i>me</i> to
sit at the grown-ups' table.

07:12.465 --> 07:14.592
Wow!

07:14.667 --> 07:18.660
I hear each person over there
gets their own biscuit.

07:18.738 --> 07:21.639
Yeah. Donna, it's glorious.

07:23.943 --> 07:25.877
Donna.

07:25.945 --> 07:29.938
Donna, I want to tell
everyone we're engaged. Tonight.

07:30.016 --> 07:33.474
Tonight? Are you sure?

07:33.553 --> 07:35.578
Yeah, I just-

07:35.655 --> 07:38.624
I just want everyone
to know, you know?

07:38.691 --> 07:41.125
So when the moment's right...

07:41.194 --> 07:43.355
we'll just-we'll tell 'em all.

07:43.429 --> 07:46.193
This is so awesome!

07:46.265 --> 07:48.995
And then,just in case,
we'll run like hell.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.900
- I probably won't wait for you.
- Oh, okay. Yeah.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.337
That's a beautiful table, Kitty.

08:02.415 --> 08:06.647
Well, thank you, Daddy.
So glad that you and Mom could be here.

08:06.719 --> 08:09.051
Well, we have to eat somewhere.

08:10.456 --> 08:14.222
And, Mom, I know that we have had
our ups and downs...

08:14.293 --> 08:16.523
but in honor of this special day...

08:16.596 --> 08:19.531
I would like to tell you
that <i>I</i> am thankful...

08:19.599 --> 08:22.966
that you are my mother,
and I love you.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.972
Isn't there something
you would like to tell me?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.604
Actually, I would like
some more tea.

08:36.115 --> 08:39.448
I'll try and slip
some booze in there...

08:39.519 --> 08:41.645
in the interest of a happy holiday.

08:46.459 --> 08:48.586
So, Thanksgiving.

08:48.661 --> 08:51.596
We celebrate the subjugation
of an indigenous people...

08:51.664 --> 08:54.929
with yams and Underdog floats.

08:55.001 --> 08:57.868
Yeah. I'm mostly celebrating
my pretty new dress.

08:59.171 --> 09:01.765
And so much for talking.

09:03.743 --> 09:06.803
May I wet your whistle, grandpa?

09:06.879 --> 09:09.404
Gonna have to say yes to that.

09:10.516 --> 09:12.814
Well, cannot let this go to waste.

09:12.885 --> 09:15.820

This is my date Carol.

09:29.101 --> 09:31.160
Ms. McGee?

09:36.142 --> 09:38.076
Kelso...

09:38.144 --> 09:40.669
you're dating my math teacher?

09:40.746 --> 09:43.010
No. No, no, no.
We're not <i>dating.</i>

09:43.082 --> 09:45.107
We just have a relationship...

09:45.184 --> 09:48.483
that I thought
we agreed to keep a secret?

09:49.822 --> 09:52.120
Well, um, welcome.

09:52.191 --> 09:55.217
Michael,
she is 1 0 years older than you.

09:55.294 --> 09:57.956
Oh, no, no.
Nine and five-twelfths.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.863
- ( Laughs ) She taught me that.
- Ooh!

10:00.933 --> 10:02.867
- Very good, Michael.
- Thank you.

10:02.935 --> 10:04.869
Okay.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.633
Kelso, how could you bring her?

10:07.707 --> 10:11.700
Oh, relax, man. She's not going to
quiz you or anything.

10:11.777 --> 10:15.577
But if she does,
the square root of zero is zero.

10:15.648 --> 10:19.675
She got me with that last night,
earned herself a free massage.

10:21.821 --> 10:25.450
Um, Ms. McGee,
being that it's a holiday and all...

10:25.524 --> 10:28.493
there are certain math-related...

10:28.561 --> 10:31.155
failing-type things
I'd rather not talk about.

10:31.230 --> 10:34.825
I hear you. There are certain things
I'd like to keep quiet too.

10:34.900 --> 10:38.063
So if anyone from the school board
should ask...

10:38.137 --> 10:40.628
I came alone,
and I left before dessert.

10:43.042 --> 10:45.340
Eric, maybe we should wait
on the big announcement...

10:45.411 --> 10:47.345
now that your math teacher is here.

10:47.413 --> 10:49.347
Oh, no, Donna.
We don't have to worry...

10:49.415 --> 10:51.440
'cause she's not
my math teacher today.

10:51.517 --> 10:54.008
Today she's a cradle-robbing slut.

10:54.086 --> 10:57.283
- Yea, student-teacher relationships!
- Yea!

10:58.524 --> 11:01.925
Hey, Laurie.
Long time no doin' it.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.625
Maybe for you.

11:06.758 --> 11:10.694
So, what time is your date
gonna let you out for recess?

11:12.197 --> 11:15.689
Nice try, Laurie. There's no recess today.
It's Thanksgiving!

11:18.203 --> 11:20.728
Wow, Laurie.

11:20.806 --> 11:24.503
( Laughs ) Yeah, me and her
really had something, huh?

11:24.576 --> 11:27.067
Yeah. Ointment
took care of that, though, right?

11:29.514 --> 11:31.505
Yeah.

11:32.784 --> 11:34.718
( Chattering )

11:34.786 --> 11:37.619
This looks great.

11:37.689 --> 11:41.386
Here you go.
One for Burt and one for Ernie.

11:43.829 --> 11:47.356
I'm calling you Ernie now
because you look like the Muppet.

11:47.432 --> 11:49.696
I didn't ask for a drink.

11:49.768 --> 11:52.100
I didn't ask to be born in a field.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.695
But you fought back
against adversity...

11:54.773 --> 11:57.298
just like your Indian brothers.

11:57.376 --> 11:59.674
What is he, Cherokee?

12:03.115 --> 12:05.083
( Singsongy )
Gobble, gobble, gobble.

12:05.150 --> 12:07.209
It's time to carve the turkey.

12:07.286 --> 12:09.516
( Giggling )
Red.

12:09.588 --> 12:12.716
Actually, Kitty,
I think this is Eric's year.

12:12.791 --> 12:17.160
<i>Seems like he's growing up</i>
<i>and finally buckling down.</i>

12:17.229 --> 12:19.891
Here you go, Son.

12:19.965 --> 12:22.092
Wow.

12:22.167 --> 12:24.101
Okay.

12:24.169 --> 12:29.038
Well, in that case, I would like to
make a... kind of announcement.

12:29.107 --> 12:32.440
<i>Check it out.!</i>
<i>I'm bread man.</i>

12:32.511 --> 12:34.479
Shut up! Eric's talking.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.673
Go ahead, honey.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.650
Okay.

12:39.718 --> 12:42.915
Well, I'm really glad
that my family's here and my friends...

12:42.988 --> 12:45.548
and, well, even my math teacher.

12:45.624 --> 12:49.424
Because, uh, something
happened a few days ago that
I'd like to share with everyone.

12:49.494 --> 12:51.325
Eric, we agreed this isn't the time.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.387
- No. No, I meant-
- Not the time for what?

12:53.465 --> 12:56.559
To talk about how he's failing math.

12:57.703 --> 13:01.104
- What?
- Fez, what the hell?

13:02.174 --> 13:05.041
I've been drinking.

13:05.110 --> 13:08.375
Mr. Forman,
you did sign the failing notice.

13:08.447 --> 13:10.711
I didn't sign-

13:10.782 --> 13:13.512
You forged my name?

13:13.585 --> 13:18.955
Wow. I really picked
the right day to come home, huh?

13:22.661 --> 13:24.595
Okay, um...

13:24.663 --> 13:26.654
who likes dark meat?

13:26.732 --> 13:30.566
Hey, who doesn't?
Am I right, ladies?

13:32.270 --> 13:34.363
Oh, Lord.

13:51.723 --> 13:54.556
So you lied to me about school.

13:54.626 --> 13:57.527
Now, it wasn't a lie so much as a...

13:57.596 --> 13:59.621
misdirection, really.

14:01.133 --> 14:03.067
We'll talk about this later.

14:03.135 --> 14:06.502
Well, Laurie, looks like
a seat just opened up for you.

14:06.571 --> 14:08.562
Come on over and grab a biscuit.

14:11.777 --> 14:14.507
Forty-two minutes
and I'm back on top.

14:16.615 --> 14:20.073
So, that was kind of a mess.

14:20.152 --> 14:22.643
Oh, no. That's what
I wanted to happen.

14:23.655 --> 14:26.317
Burt, honey, pass me your plate.

14:27.793 --> 14:29.761
Burtikins.

14:30.762 --> 14:32.787
- Burt!
- I'm up.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.925
Bob, you know what
Eric's problem is?

14:36.001 --> 14:38.231
All that time he's spending
with your daughter.

14:38.303 --> 14:40.237
Hey, Donna ain't the problem.

14:40.305 --> 14:45.572
Eric's the one who corrupted her up so dirty,
I had to send her to Catholic school.

14:45.644 --> 14:47.976
How could he be failing math?

14:48.046 --> 14:50.514
Kitty, I'm sure
he did the best he could.

14:50.582 --> 14:53.813
For someone who was
held too long as a baby.

14:55.287 --> 14:58.586
I bet that explains
why he hit puberty so late too.

14:58.657 --> 15:01.319
No. That was because
of your mother's smoking.

15:05.697 --> 15:11.101
Fez, I know you've only spoken English
for a couple weeks now, but...

15:11.169 --> 15:14.070
could you have learned the words,
''Don't tell my dad''?

15:14.139 --> 15:16.073
''Don't,'' a contraction
meaning ''do not''...

15:16.141 --> 15:18.701
and ''tell my dad,'' meaning <i>shut up?</i>

15:20.145 --> 15:23.410
Okay, right there,
you just told me not to shut up.

15:23.482 --> 15:26.076
It's a wonder you're not
failing English too.

15:26.151 --> 15:28.619
Crack a book,
you lazy son of a bitch.

15:29.988 --> 15:31.922
So, guys...

15:31.990 --> 15:34.083
Ms. McGee.
( Laughs )

15:34.159 --> 15:37.890
Pretty nice, huh? If they put one of her
in every classroom...

15:37.963 --> 15:41.592
I'd never skip school again,
if you know what I mean.

15:41.666 --> 15:44.100
I mean, I'm doin' it with my teacher!

15:44.169 --> 15:47.297
Oh, shh! It's a secret.

15:48.340 --> 15:50.365
I've never been with a teacher.

15:50.442 --> 15:53.639
But I was with the post-office lady.
That was cool.

15:53.712 --> 15:57.204
I got a hundred free stamps
and a monster roll of tape.

15:57.282 --> 16:00.911
I like older women.
They always got something smart to say.

16:03.121 --> 16:05.487
<i>( Stereo:Soft Rock )</i>

16:05.557 --> 16:09.584
I think I could probably
fit inside of a record player.

16:09.661 --> 16:11.925
That's gotta sound good in there.

16:11.997 --> 16:14.397
Inside of a record player?

16:16.334 --> 16:18.495
I miss dating Kelso.

16:18.570 --> 16:20.561
The guys I'm with now, they're so-

16:20.639 --> 16:22.732
I don't know.
What's the word?

16:22.807 --> 16:25.037
Married.

16:25.110 --> 16:28.637
Hey, <i>you</i> and Kelso didn't date.

16:28.713 --> 16:30.908
You're just a tramp he cheated with.

16:30.982 --> 16:34.543
And you contaminated him
so much, I ended up with Steven...

16:34.619 --> 16:36.917
who I love being with.

16:36.988 --> 16:39.013
So thank you.

16:40.025 --> 16:41.993
Wow. I'm the only one here...

16:42.060 --> 16:44.187
who's never been with Kelso.

16:44.262 --> 16:46.389
Which makes me wanna say, ''Ew!''

16:46.464 --> 16:48.694
And also, ''Thank God.''

16:50.135 --> 16:52.126
But you, I mean, you're a teacher.

16:52.203 --> 16:55.001
Can't you get in trouble
for dating a student?

16:55.073 --> 16:57.803
Hey, let 'em come and get me.

16:57.876 --> 16:59.867
He's 1 8.

16:59.945 --> 17:01.879
I make $1 1 ,000 a year.

17:01.947 --> 17:04.540
I <i>deserve</i> a little something.

17:10.689 --> 17:13.123
So, that was one rootin'-tootin'...

17:13.191 --> 17:15.921
big, old crap of a day, huh?

17:15.993 --> 17:18.019
Yep. Pretty much.

17:18.096 --> 17:20.894
I just really wanted to tell people
that we were engaged.

17:20.965 --> 17:22.900
Know what?
Maybe it'd be easier...

17:22.968 --> 17:25.868
if we just showed up
next Thanksgiving with a kid.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.641
Hey, thanks for dinner, Kitty.

17:30.709 --> 17:33.803
I'll remember to wear
my stretch pants next time.

17:33.878 --> 17:37.109
Oh, let me know
if you find that button.

17:37.182 --> 17:40.913
Good night. I apologize
if my being here upset you.

17:40.986 --> 17:45.389
No, no, no. I- I just feel
you being seen out with a student...

17:45.457 --> 17:48.620
is- it's just awfully bad principle.

17:48.693 --> 17:51.560
He doesn't care.
He's dating a cheerleader.

17:54.132 --> 17:56.794
Burt. Burtie Bear.

17:58.136 --> 18:00.969
- Burt!
- Grandma, let me.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.676
- Grandpa!
- I'm up!

18:07.479 --> 18:10.471
My goodness,
you are going to make some lucky man...

18:10.548 --> 18:12.948
a wonderful wife!

18:13.018 --> 18:15.179
Oh, my God.

18:15.253 --> 18:17.278
That's where Laurie
gets her mean streak.

18:17.355 --> 18:20.415
It's not from delightful me.
It's from my evil mother!

18:21.826 --> 18:23.817
So evil skips a generation.

18:25.463 --> 18:28.591
So that means
that my granddaughter...

18:28.667 --> 18:30.601
is gonna be the devil.

18:30.669 --> 18:33.638
Well, don't worry. Because no woman's
gonna wanna bear your idiot kids...

18:33.705 --> 18:35.696
if you can't even pass math.

18:37.709 --> 18:40.109
How could you forge my signature?

18:40.178 --> 18:43.079
- Here comes yelling.
- Yeah. I don't wanna hear this.

18:43.148 --> 18:45.878
I'll help with the dishes.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.350
And I'll take
these half-empty glasses.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.082
Okay. No, no.
You've had enough.

18:51.156 --> 18:53.090
Eric.

18:53.158 --> 18:55.217
What the hell is wrong with you?

18:55.293 --> 18:57.921
He doesn't understand
consequences, Daddy.

18:57.996 --> 19:00.055
Well, maybe he'll understand this.

19:00.131 --> 19:03.828
From now on, every time
you disobey me...

19:03.902 --> 19:07.099
or lie to me or do anything
that pisses me off...

19:07.172 --> 19:09.333
you're gonna pay me money.

19:10.875 --> 19:14.936
Pay you?
Wait, you're fining me?

19:15.013 --> 19:18.779
It's like giving him tickets
for being dumb.

19:18.850 --> 19:23.412
Okay, okay. I think we're forgetting
about a time-tested punishment.

19:23.488 --> 19:26.582
There's your foot. Here's my ass.
Swing away.

19:27.926 --> 19:29.860
Well, it obviously doesn't work.

19:29.928 --> 19:32.863
So, for forging my name...

19:32.931 --> 19:35.058
you owe me 30 bucks.

19:39.170 --> 19:41.229
Daddy, can I borrow $30?

19:41.306 --> 19:44.070
- Sure, kitten.
- Wha-

19:44.142 --> 19:47.134
Laurie, your grandparents
are sleeping in your room.

19:47.212 --> 19:51.046
So you take Eric's room,
and the math whiz can ride the couch.

19:55.386 --> 19:59.447
Well, another Thanksgiving
come and gone.

19:59.524 --> 20:01.958
Certainly an eventful day, hmm?

20:02.026 --> 20:04.927
Yeah. But with
our ungrateful daughter...

20:04.996 --> 20:08.159
that dumb-ass son...

20:08.233 --> 20:10.861
and a drunk foreign kid, I'd say...

20:12.971 --> 20:15.701
actually, it was
a little better than last year.

20:20.145 --> 20:23.581
- I know we're young.
- But we're totally in love.

20:23.648 --> 20:25.639
And we just want you to know...

20:25.717 --> 20:27.810
- we're engaged!
- We're engaged!

20:32.457 --> 20:34.687
- Feels good to tell someone.
- Yeah.

20:34.759 --> 20:36.750
I think they're happy for us.

20:39.631 --> 20:41.622
Look, Schotzie's celebrating.
