JONAS VENTURE:
Zoology -- a cat has
over 100 vocal cords,

00:05.405 --> 00:07.601
while the giraffe has none.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.768
Astronomy -- the temperature
of the sun can reach

00:09.843 --> 00:11.971
50 million degrees fahrenheit.

00:12.045 --> 00:14.514
Anatomy --
there are 9,000 taste buds

00:14.581 --> 00:15.605
on your tongue.

00:15.682 --> 00:18.311
And the answer to today's
trigonometry problem is --

00:18.385 --> 00:19.444
[ beep]

00:19.519 --> 00:21.010
Well, would you look at that?

00:21.087 --> 00:22.715
It would appear that's all
the time we have...

00:22.789 --> 00:24.087
RUSTY'S VOICE:
Hank and Dean.

00:24.157 --> 00:26.717
Today marks the completion of
our progressive, electronic,

00:26.793 --> 00:29.558
cross-disciplinary educational
journey together.

00:29.629 --> 00:31.188
You're now fully prepared
to embark

00:31.264 --> 00:33.392
on your first
solo adventure --

00:33.466 --> 00:36.231
to college and the fulfilling
life of super-science

00:36.302 --> 00:37.964
that awaits beyond.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.236
So I suppose the only thing
I have left to say is...

00:41.307 --> 00:42.866
ALL:
Congratulations.

Hey, what you got there?

00:56.790 --> 00:58.224
It's a diploma.

00:58.291 --> 00:59.156
Weren't you listening?

00:59.225 --> 01:01.558
- Uh, what?
- I think we just graduated.

01:01.628 --> 01:03.153
We did? Cool!

01:03.229 --> 01:05.027
Does that mean we can finally
ditch these nerd pods

01:05.098 --> 01:06.293
and get bunk beds?

01:06.366 --> 01:07.459
I don't know.

01:07.534 --> 01:09.696
Where's yours?

[ indistinct conversations ]

01:18.078 --> 01:20.775
Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
Come to order.

01:20.847 --> 01:22.611
We have a movement on the floor.

01:22.682 --> 01:24.014
Councilman 2?

01:24.084 --> 01:26.315
In the interest of preserving
the sanctity

01:26.386 --> 01:27.911
of this esteemed council,

01:27.987 --> 01:30.047
I propose that we immediately
commence

01:30.123 --> 01:31.147
the vetting
of candidates

01:31.224 --> 01:33.056
to replace
Councilman 8.

01:33.126 --> 01:33.957
- Yes!
- Yeah.

01:34.027 --> 01:36.223
Whoa! Why?
What did I do?

01:36.296 --> 01:39.289
We are the council of 13,
not the council of 12.

01:39.365 --> 01:42.301
And since your merger
with Councilman 3,

01:42.368 --> 01:44.064
your screen
has remained vacant.

01:44.137 --> 01:45.537
Well, I'm still here!

01:45.605 --> 01:47.335
It's not as if
we're only one guy now

01:47.407 --> 01:49.740
just because of this --
this head business.

01:49.809 --> 01:51.903
Well, now, I-I sort of see
their point.

01:51.978 --> 01:54.743
See?
We don't even vote the same.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.949
Tell the others, Wisdom.
It's time.

02:06.025 --> 02:07.960
All right,
hands where I can see them.

02:08.026 --> 02:09.620
Oh, aren't you cute?

02:09.696 --> 02:12.894
You know the drill.

Guy's batshit crazy.

- Oh, my god!
- What?

03:40.553 --> 03:42.749
Don't move.
There is a bug on you.

03:42.822 --> 03:45.724
There is? Where?!
Oh, God! Get it off!

03:45.792 --> 03:47.351
It's one of those ones

03:47.427 --> 03:48.588
I hate those!

03:48.661 --> 03:49.993
Yes, it's
unfortunate

03:50.063 --> 03:51.929
they had to be
sacrificed, Wisdom,

03:51.998 --> 03:53.466
but don't
blame yourself.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.195
Your plan was brilliant.

03:55.268 --> 03:56.793
A work of art.

03:56.869 --> 04:00.271
All it needs now
is a signature.

04:00.340 --> 04:01.535
It is quite simple.

04:01.608 --> 04:04.544
On days with T's in them,
we sit in my screen.

04:04.611 --> 04:06.170
On all others, we're in
Dragoon's.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.680
Yes, yes.
I like this.

04:07.747 --> 04:11.775
Gentlemen! It seems there is
another movement on the floor.

04:11.851 --> 04:13.513
I heard nothing!

04:13.586 --> 04:15.680
And it is a doozy.

04:18.156 --> 04:19.420
What is the point of
all this?

04:19.492 --> 04:20.721
State law mandates

04:20.793 --> 04:22.887
each student gets a minimum
of two hours face time

04:22.962 --> 04:24.931
with a certified
guidance counselor

04:24.998 --> 04:26.626
or, in this case,
a friend of your dad's.

04:26.699 --> 04:28.327
What's a guidance
counselor?

04:28.401 --> 04:29.960
Usually it's a guy
you barely know

04:30.036 --> 04:31.402
who gives you
career advice,

04:31.471 --> 04:34.100
even though his career
is guidance counselor,

04:34.173 --> 04:36.039
and sometimes he helps you get
into college.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.941
But I don't want to go
to college.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.274
Well, it's not
for everybody.

04:39.345 --> 04:40.711
That's why we're doing this --

04:40.780 --> 04:43.079
to determine what individual
path is right for you.

04:43.149 --> 04:44.879
So, uh, what did you put down?

04:44.951 --> 04:45.941
Ahem!

04:46.019 --> 04:47.282
Number one --"drifter."

04:47.353 --> 04:48.412
All right. Okay.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.013
That's not really a career,
Hank.

04:50.089 --> 04:51.455
It's like the opposite
of a career.

04:51.524 --> 04:54.187
Ah, but you don't need to go to
college to be one, right?

04:54.260 --> 04:56.126
Plus, you get paid to just
walk around all day

04:56.195 --> 04:57.857
reading sexy
letters,

04:57.930 --> 04:59.558
like the guy in
"Red Shoe Diaries."

04:59.632 --> 05:00.895
He wasn't a drifter.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.026
The guy's getting
all his mail.

05:02.101 --> 05:03.399
That implies a fixed address.

05:03.469 --> 05:04.459
Okay, fine.

05:04.537 --> 05:05.971
Then, like,
David "The Hulk" Banner.

05:06.039 --> 05:07.837
Well, David Banner's
real name is actually

05:07.907 --> 05:09.933
<i>Dr.</i> David Bruce Banner.

05:10.009 --> 05:11.341
So he's a scientist.

05:11.411 --> 05:13.107
Oh, then I don't want
to be that.

05:13.179 --> 05:14.306
Well, what's your
second choice?

05:14.380 --> 05:16.906
"Owner and operator of
The Chimp Eden."

05:16.983 --> 05:19.009
Okay, well, that's
barely saner,

05:19.085 --> 05:20.644
but for that
we're talking

05:20.720 --> 05:23.019
three, four years of
veterinary school, minimum,

05:23.089 --> 05:25.081
and that's on top
of a bachelor's degree.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.091
[groans ]

05:26.159 --> 05:27.354
Scratch that one, too.

05:27.427 --> 05:28.986
Man, way to ruin Chimp Eden.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.156
Okay, you, uh, made
a mistake here.

05:31.230 --> 05:32.391
You wrote "Batman" twice.

05:32.465 --> 05:33.592
That's intentional.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.032
Number three is
golden age Batman,

05:35.101 --> 05:37.127
and number four is
post-crisis Batman.

05:37.203 --> 05:39.263
They're, like, two completely
different Batmen.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.137
[sighs ]
Okay.

05:41.207 --> 05:43.472
So that just leaves
"secutor"?

05:43.543 --> 05:44.704
Were you trying to spell
"executive"?

05:44.777 --> 05:47.372
Duh, a "secutor" is
a kind of gladiator.

05:47.447 --> 05:48.710
They've got the coolest helmets,

05:48.781 --> 05:50.750
and they get to beat up
on those gay lord gladiators

05:50.817 --> 05:52.615
with the nets and tridents.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.950
Retiarius --
my favorite gladiator.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.421
- Gay lord.
- Okay.

05:56.489 --> 05:57.957
Dean, how about you?

05:58.024 --> 06:00.516
What did you put down for your
top-five dream jobs?

06:00.593 --> 06:03.495
Well, I-I only got four...
now.

06:03.563 --> 06:04.656
Oh, well, that's
because you forgot

06:04.731 --> 06:07.132
super-scientist, boy.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.361
No, I didn't.

06:08.434 --> 06:09.458
Looks like you
already have

06:09.535 --> 06:12.369
the "absent-minded"
part down, eh, Professor?

06:12.438 --> 06:14.236
[ chuckles ]
Okay.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.935
Now go upstairs and get dressed,
both of you.

06:16.008 --> 06:17.806
We're looking at college
this afternoon.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.539
I don't want to go
to college!

06:19.612 --> 06:20.511
Hank, don't
start.

06:20.580 --> 06:21.673
Okay, kids.

06:21.748 --> 06:25.844
Uh, you think I could have
a moment alone with your dad?

06:25.918 --> 06:28.615
Well, did you push State
like I asked you?

06:28.688 --> 06:29.553
[sighs ]

06:29.622 --> 06:31.887
I hate to be the one
to break this to you, Rust,

06:31.958 --> 06:34.223
but your boys
are pathetically underprepared

06:34.293 --> 06:35.158
for adulthood.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.163
Well, sure,
Hank's a bit of a late bloomer,

06:37.230 --> 06:38.698
but did you catch
Dean's little mustache?

06:38.765 --> 06:39.733
Really starting to come in.

06:39.799 --> 06:41.631
Yeah, regardless
of the 'stache,

06:41.701 --> 06:43.727
neither of them knows a thing
about the real world.

06:43.803 --> 06:44.896
What are you
talking about?

06:44.971 --> 06:46.098
Those kids have been
around the globe

06:46.172 --> 06:47.902
more times than
Gaetan Dugas.

06:47.974 --> 06:49.533
But the stuff those beds have
been teaching them

06:49.609 --> 06:51.737
is more dated
than Funk & Wagnalls.

06:51.811 --> 06:53.746
I mean, what college do you
think is gonna accept

06:53.813 --> 06:56.112
transcripts from a talking bed,
anyway?

06:56.182 --> 06:59.118
Especially since, uh, if I'm
even reading them right,

06:59.185 --> 07:02.849
Hank didn't graduate.

07:02.922 --> 07:04.083
Hank!

07:04.157 --> 07:06.251
I'm not going
to college.

07:06.325 --> 07:07.657
Darn tootin',
you're not,

07:07.727 --> 07:09.286
because you're
getting right back in that bed

07:09.362 --> 07:11.092
until you graduate, mister!

07:11.164 --> 07:12.996
No, father,
I'm going to a place

07:13.065 --> 07:14.829
where you and your
crummy bed

07:14.901 --> 07:17.097
can't tell me
what to do anymore.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.001
What is this?

07:18.070 --> 07:19.265
What, are you
fake running away again?

07:19.338 --> 07:20.772
Well, don't expect your brother
to sneak food out

07:20.840 --> 07:22.570
to your tent
in the backyard this time,

07:22.642 --> 07:24.702
because <i>he's</i> going
to college!

07:24.777 --> 07:26.302
Well, bully for him,

07:26.379 --> 07:28.610
because I'm joining the army.

07:28.681 --> 07:30.115
Hot dog!

07:30.183 --> 07:32.175
Best decision
you'll ever make, son.

07:32.251 --> 07:34.277
Why, I look back
on my time with --

07:34.353 --> 07:36.049
Not that army,
Sergeant Butt-kiss.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.283
[sighs ]

07:37.356 --> 07:39.154
Dean!
Are you dressed yet?

07:39.225 --> 07:40.352
- Yeah.
- Oh.

07:40.426 --> 07:42.418
Uh, well, then --
then get in the car.

07:42.495 --> 07:43.758
Wait.

07:43.830 --> 07:44.798
Is that what you're wearing?

07:44.864 --> 07:47.891
UNDERBHEIT:
Ah, manservant.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.129
What has become of us?

07:50.203 --> 07:52.468
A kingdom had I.

07:52.538 --> 07:54.234
You got something
for a veteran?

07:54.307 --> 07:56.276
Don't forget the veterans!

07:56.342 --> 07:57.332
Do you have any change?

07:57.410 --> 07:59.572
All right, you bums.
Move it along.

07:59.645 --> 08:00.806
Aw, man.

08:00.880 --> 08:01.779
Same old shit.

08:01.848 --> 08:03.749
It's like Kent State
all over again, man!

08:03.816 --> 08:06.012
[electricity buzzing ]

08:06.085 --> 08:08.213
Yeah, stick it to the man,
my brother!

08:08.287 --> 08:10.222
Hey, can I have his coat?

08:10.289 --> 08:13.123
Oh, get a job.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.754
Richard. Richard.

08:17.830 --> 08:18.889
Hello.

08:18.965 --> 08:19.830
S-Sally?

08:19.899 --> 08:21.162
Afraid not,
old boy.

08:21.234 --> 08:22.998
Ah! Oh!

08:23.069 --> 08:25.038
I'd heard you'd lost your mind
and stopped working,

08:25.104 --> 08:28.165
but it looks like
you've been...busy.

08:28.241 --> 08:30.107
D-D-Do you work for me?

08:30.176 --> 08:31.405
I had something
more along the lines

08:31.477 --> 08:33.378
