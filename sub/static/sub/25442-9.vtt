♪♪

00:04.420 --> 00:06.790
Raven: Raven's Home was
filmed in front of a live
studio audience.

00:06.790 --> 00:09.000
(crunching loudly)

00:13.960 --> 00:16.460
Could you crunch
any louder?

00:16.460 --> 00:17.500
Sure.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.330
(crunching loudly)

00:21.500 --> 00:23.580
I mean, you asked.
(laughs)

00:24.620 --> 00:26.920
Could you two be
any more immature?

00:26.920 --> 00:29.500
Probably.
(burps)

00:29.500 --> 00:31.920
(boys laugh)

00:31.920 --> 00:33.250
Both:
Yup!

00:34.380 --> 00:36.290
You know,
what they say is right.

00:36.290 --> 00:39.250
Breakfast really is
the most annoying
meal of the day.

00:41.380 --> 00:43.920
Sorry, Nia, we just love
our Franken Crunch.

00:43.920 --> 00:47.330
And Berry Buddies.
You can call us
"Franken Buddies."

00:47.330 --> 00:48.830
Ha!

00:48.830 --> 00:50.500
(phone rings)

00:50.500 --> 00:53.380
-What's that?
-Oh, calm down.
It's the landline.

00:54.670 --> 00:57.420
Hello? Oh yes,
Principal Wentworth.

00:57.420 --> 01:01.460
If one of y'all did anything,
you gonna get it.

01:03.250 --> 01:05.210
So glad you're an angel.

01:05.210 --> 01:08.420
Oh yeah, well, um,
she's right here.
(clears throat)

01:08.420 --> 01:10.120
-It's about yo angel.
-Oh.

01:11.120 --> 01:15.420
-(laughs) Looks like
Levi's gonna get it.
-(Nia and Booker laugh)

01:15.420 --> 01:18.120
-No, I'm not. I'm a
model student, Auntie Rae.
-(phone beeps)

01:18.120 --> 01:20.420
(clears throat)
Levi, Principal
Wentworth wants

01:20.420 --> 01:22.000
to see us first thing
this morning.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.960
I'm gonna get it.

01:31.080 --> 01:33.580
Bookman! You okay?

01:33.580 --> 01:36.580
Yeah. I'm...
just worried about Levi.

01:36.580 --> 01:38.210
He's in the principal's office.

01:38.210 --> 01:40.420
No, he'll be fine.
Now focus.

01:40.420 --> 01:42.540
We've got
some serious business
to take care of.

01:42.540 --> 01:45.000
Sorry. Proceed.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.460
(mimicking farting)

01:49.710 --> 01:51.920
You guys got nothing.

01:53.210 --> 01:54.460
Check this out.

01:56.710 --> 01:58.750
Ah. (laughs)

01:58.750 --> 02:01.290
It didn't even
make a sound.

02:01.290 --> 02:03.500
-Lame!
-We'll wait for it.

02:04.960 --> 02:07.040
(sniffs)
Oh!

02:07.040 --> 02:08.580
(chuckles)

02:08.580 --> 02:10.460
(nasally)
How did you
make it smell?

02:10.460 --> 02:12.000
Science.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.790
-(gags)
-(school bell rings)

02:14.790 --> 02:16.380
Morning, students.

02:16.380 --> 02:19.170
Who's ready to have fun
in Science class?

02:20.710 --> 02:22.380
You are...

02:22.380 --> 02:25.500
because science does matter.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.040
(teacher laughs)

02:28.120 --> 02:31.290
Anyway, we have
a new student
joining us today.

02:31.290 --> 02:33.500
Ooh, I hope
it's a pretty girl,

02:33.500 --> 02:36.540
'cause she's gonna
be sitting next
to the Bookman!

02:36.540 --> 02:40.290
-(boys laugh)
-Class, please welcome
Levi Grayson.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.750
-Levi?
-He's not a pretty girl.

02:46.920 --> 02:49.000
Levi, I thought
you were in trouble.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.580
Nope. Principal Wentworth
just thought I needed to be

02:51.580 --> 02:53.170
in a more advanced
science class.

02:53.170 --> 02:55.500
Isn't that great,
Franken Buddy?

02:55.500 --> 02:57.380
Both:
"Franken Buddy"?

02:57.380 --> 02:59.580
It-- it's a cereal thing.

02:59.580 --> 03:02.750
That's cute. You guys
are Franken Buddies.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.250

03:05.580 --> 03:06.830

(laughing)

04:03.290 --> 04:04.670
Uh, Ms. Pittman?

04:04.670 --> 04:06.330
When you say
our science projects

04:06.330 --> 04:07.790
are due "this week,"

04:07.790 --> 04:09.830
do you mean this "this week"

04:09.830 --> 04:11.750
or next "this week"?

04:11.750 --> 04:14.580
Well, since that makes
no sense at all...

04:16.040 --> 04:17.540
I mean three days from now.

04:17.540 --> 04:19.620
And when you say,
"Three days from now," like--

04:19.620 --> 04:21.880
Friday, Curtis.
I mean Friday!

04:23.580 --> 04:25.830
My first advanced
science project.

04:25.830 --> 04:27.250
Should we get to work?

04:27.250 --> 04:30.040
We're working
a little science
of our own, first.

04:30.040 --> 04:32.210
Teach us how
to make them smell!

04:32.210 --> 04:33.710
(gasps)
Pittman alert.

04:34.830 --> 04:37.120
Aerodynamics was
my first choice,

04:37.120 --> 04:40.000
but after testing
the viscosity

04:40.000 --> 04:43.120
and quantum density
of the atmosphere proved--

04:43.120 --> 04:45.580
You're getting really good
at using big words

04:45.580 --> 04:46.880
to pretend we're working.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.420
He knows big words,
because every night,

04:49.420 --> 04:51.380
we go over the word of the day.

04:51.380 --> 04:52.750
Tell 'em last night's word,
Booker.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.120
Um, there wasn't one,

04:55.120 --> 04:57.620
because we don't do that...

04:57.620 --> 05:00.830
ever. Excuse us a second.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.000
The word was "befuddled,"

05:05.000 --> 05:07.670
which means confused,
which is what I am right now.

05:07.670 --> 05:10.710
Well, then let me
unfuddle you.

05:10.710 --> 05:13.000
Curtis and The Guntz
are my boys.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.330
And we don't talk about stuff
like "words of the day."

05:15.330 --> 05:17.750
We're just cool,
so just be cool.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.790
Got it! Be cool.

05:21.380 --> 05:23.580
So, what are you guys doing
for your projects?

05:23.580 --> 05:26.000
I'm going
with the classic
erupting volcano.

05:26.000 --> 05:28.040
Me too.
Easy "A."

05:28.040 --> 05:29.380
Oof.

05:32.710 --> 05:34.500
What's wrong
with the volcano?

05:34.500 --> 05:36.710
Well, it's just
that I did that project

05:36.710 --> 05:38.380
in my fourth-grade class,

05:38.380 --> 05:41.460
and I thought this class
was more advanced.

05:41.460 --> 05:42.710
Okay.

05:43.710 --> 05:47.790
Um... I'm befuddled
by what you think
"cool" means.

05:47.790 --> 05:50.670
Look, just try to relax,

05:50.670 --> 05:52.290
and if you get the chance,
make 'em laugh.

05:53.250 --> 05:56.380
-Got it.
-So, what's Levi

05:56.380 --> 05:58.670
the Tiny Science Guy
doing for his project?

05:58.670 --> 06:00.500
The elephant
toothpaste experiment.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.120
It's where you cause
a chemical reaction

06:02.120 --> 06:04.710
in the bottle
and foam slowly oozes out.

06:04.710 --> 06:06.710
Hey, I'm doing that too.

06:06.710 --> 06:09.540
Of course, I have
some experience with foam,

06:09.540 --> 06:11.880
since I have to shave
my beard every day.

06:11.880 --> 06:13.790
You don't have a beard.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.000
That's 'cause...
I shave.

06:18.330 --> 06:19.790
Both:
Cool!

06:19.790 --> 06:21.330
It's true.
I've seen it.

06:21.330 --> 06:23.460
See? The man knows.

06:23.460 --> 06:26.710
Yup, every night when
he's taking his bubble bath,

06:26.710 --> 06:29.540
he makes
this giant bubble beard

06:29.540 --> 06:31.170
and shaves it.

06:31.170 --> 06:32.790
(laughs)
So hilarious!

06:34.290 --> 06:36.580
(both laugh)

06:36.580 --> 06:39.380
Dude! You still take
bubble baths?

06:39.380 --> 06:41.880
-Well, I-I--
-(laughter continues)

06:41.880 --> 06:44.580
The Bookman is
now Bubblebeard.

06:45.710 --> 06:47.790
I did it.
I made them laugh.

06:47.790 --> 06:49.790
-Isn't this great?
-Yeah.

06:50.790 --> 06:51.620
Great.

06:53.750 --> 06:55.000
Cool. Cool. Cool.

06:58.670 --> 07:01.880
-(both grunt)
-I can get it in!
I can get it in!

07:01.880 --> 07:04.710
Come on, close! Close!

07:04.710 --> 07:07.170
That's the problem, Chels!
We got too many clothes!

07:07.170 --> 07:09.420
-(both grunt)
-Is everything okay?

07:09.420 --> 07:11.080
It sounds
like two warthogs
trying to poop.

07:12.580 --> 07:14.080
-We're fine, sweetie.
-Chelsea: Yeah, I'm good

07:14.080 --> 07:15.420
Do you need help
closing that door?

07:15.420 --> 07:17.040
Both:
Uh, yes!

07:17.040 --> 07:19.120
Great, great.
Give away all
your old clothes.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.420
-Problem solved. See ya.
-Nia! Get back here.

07:21.420 --> 07:23.540
Real help.
Come on, push!

07:23.540 --> 07:24.920
-Chelsea:
Come on, push!
-(door creaking)

07:24.920 --> 07:27.960
(adults grunt)

07:27.960 --> 07:29.330
Grunt, Nia.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.250
(grunting)

07:33.250 --> 07:36.120
-Come on! Oh! Yes!
-Yes!

07:36.120 --> 07:37.920
There she goes!

07:37.920 --> 07:39.920
Good grunting, Nia!
(giggles)

07:39.920 --> 07:42.120
-See? We don't have
that much stuff.
-No.

07:42.120 --> 07:44.620
(door creaking)

07:45.790 --> 07:48.500
Uh-oh.
(screams)

07:51.080 --> 07:52.750
Maybe we should get
rid of a few things.

07:59.120 --> 08:00.880
I just don't get it.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.920
Your teeth have been
like that all day.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.710
Are you mad at me,
or are you working
on a ventriloquist act?

08:08.080 --> 08:09.920
Do you see a puppet?

08:11.120 --> 08:14.040
Uh-oh, Rae.
Are the boys
fighting? Huh?

08:14.040 --> 08:16.080
Do you think we
should be good parents
and go talk to 'em?

08:16.080 --> 08:18.880
No, no, we should be great
parents and let them figure it
out for themselves.

08:21.120 --> 08:22.790
How could you tell Curtis
and The Guntz

08:22.790 --> 08:24.250
that I still take
bubble baths?

08:24.250 --> 08:25.920
Now they call me
"Bubblebeard."

08:25.920 --> 08:27.500
Sorry I embarrassed you, Booker.

08:27.500 --> 08:30.380
I was just taking your advice
and trying to make 'em laugh.

08:31.830 --> 08:32.920
I know.

08:33.920 --> 08:35.920
Listen, just promise me
from now on

08:35.920 --> 08:39.460
what happens in apartment 3B
stays in apartment 3B.

08:39.460 --> 08:42.790
Zip it, lock it,
put it in my pocket.

08:44.210 --> 08:46.420
There's my Franken Buddy!

08:47.460 --> 08:48.500
-Hey, Mom.
-Hey, sweetheart.

08:48.500 --> 08:49.880
-Hey, honeys.
-(Raven chuckles)

08:49.880 --> 08:51.170
-Hm-hmm.
-What?

08:51.170 --> 08:53.040
-See? Good parenting.
-Raven: Mm-hmm.

08:53.040 --> 08:54.880
-Is that smoke?
-Yeah, Rae,

08:54.880 --> 08:57.000
because we are on fire!
Go, moms!

08:57.000 --> 08:59.460
No, Chels!
Something's actually on fire!

08:59.460 --> 09:01.580
I turned the oven on,
but I haven't put
anything in it yet.

09:01.580 --> 09:03.460
No, my-- my shoes!

09:03.460 --> 09:05.790
-Chelsea: Oh my god!
-(Raven screams)

09:05.790 --> 09:07.750
-(fire alarm beeping)
-Oh no! Oh no!

09:07.750 --> 09:09.170
Oh no! Get it-- ah!

09:12.380 --> 09:13.790
No!

09:13.790 --> 09:15.000
No.

09:15.000 --> 09:18.920
No! You fried
my flip flop!

09:20.920 --> 09:23.880
Mom, when I said
you needed to clean stuff
out of your closet,

09:23.880 --> 09:25.040
I meant out
of the apartment!

09:25.040 --> 09:28.170
Oh. Oh, well,
this is your fault
for not being specific.

09:30.420 --> 09:31.960
Okay, I'm taking over
this operation.

09:31.960 --> 09:34.000
No, calm down, Nia.
We can handle
our own stuff.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.880
Yeah, Nia, we're adults.

09:35.880 --> 09:37.790
-Oh, really?
-Adults: Yeah.

09:37.790 --> 09:39.380
-(beeps)
-(screams)

09:42.830 --> 09:45.040
Chels, we're adults
that need help.

09:45.040 --> 09:46.380
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

09:51.380 --> 09:54.000
Okay, Levi,
remember the rules.
Don't embarrass me.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.250
Don't worry, Book,
I got your back.

09:57.290 --> 09:58.420
Hey, guys.
What's going on?

09:58.420 --> 10:00.620
-Hey, Bubblebeard.
-(both laugh)

10:00.620 --> 10:02.380
He doesn't like
when you call him that.

10:02.380 --> 10:03.960
-Why not?
-It's funny!

10:03.960 --> 10:05.880
-It's mean.
-Uh, Levi.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.250
I got this.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.750
Booker's sensitive,
and words hurt him,

10:12.750 --> 10:14.000
so make nice.

10:17.830 --> 10:19.080
What just happened?

10:19.080 --> 10:22.380
Levi just gave you
a new new nickname,

10:22.380 --> 10:26.040
-"Mr. Sensitive."
-(both laugh)

10:26.040 --> 10:28.250
Dude, that little kid is
wrecking your game.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.080
Hey, Nia, have you
seen Booker?

10:41.080 --> 10:42.620
No. Why?

10:42.620 --> 10:44.460
We have the same
lunch period now,

10:44.460 --> 10:45.710
and he's supposed
to meet me here.

10:45.710 --> 10:47.790
Maybe he's in
the cafeteria already.

10:47.790 --> 10:51.580
And forgot to meet me?
No, he wouldn't do that.

10:53.080 --> 10:54.830
You're right.
I'm sure he'll show up.

10:56.290 --> 10:58.040
Maybe he did forget.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.750
Boy:
Oh, he didn't forget.

11:00.750 --> 11:02.210
Who said that?

11:02.210 --> 11:04.960
We've been watching you.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.000
Here. You'll need this.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.000
"Dissed Sibs Anonymous"?

11:11.000 --> 11:13.120
(whispers)
It's a secret support group.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.830
for kids who get dissed
by their older siblings.

11:17.040 --> 11:20.040
-Why would I need that?
-Because you just got dissed.

11:21.210 --> 11:22.960
No, I didn't.
He'll show up.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.250
Read the back of the card.

11:27.080 --> 11:28.420
"They never show up."

11:29.460 --> 11:30.920
That's our motto.

11:30.920 --> 11:34.210
We meet Thursdays, 4:00,
in the science room.

11:34.210 --> 11:36.620
If you're gonna come,
bring guac.

11:36.620 --> 11:40.000
Thanks anyway,
but Booker's not like that.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.460
Hold the card
up to the light.

11:42.920 --> 11:45.040
'That's what they all say."

11:55.290 --> 11:57.790
Okay, you've separated
all of your clothes

11:57.790 --> 11:59.580
into "Keep," "Maybe,"

11:59.580 --> 12:00.790
and "Garage Sale."

12:00.790 --> 12:03.210
-Yeah.
-Are you 100% sure
of your decisions?

12:04.750 --> 12:06.120
-Yes.
-Positive.

12:06.120 --> 12:07.420
Great...

12:07.420 --> 12:09.460
then you won't mind
me doing this.

12:09.460 --> 12:12.460
-No!
-(sobs)

12:12.460 --> 12:14.250
Leave my maybes alone!

12:14.250 --> 12:17.380
Sorry, ladies,
but maybes are
for babies.

12:17.380 --> 12:19.040
If it wasn't good enough
for the "Keep" box.

12:19.040 --> 12:20.460
it goes
in the goodbye box.

12:20.460 --> 12:23.460
No, no, no!
Not my Hawaiian shirt!

12:23.460 --> 12:24.880
Really, Chels?
Really? Really.

12:24.880 --> 12:26.540
When was the last time
you actually wore that?

12:26.540 --> 12:28.080
I don't--
a few years ago!

12:28.080 --> 12:30.080
If you haven't worn it
in a year,

12:30.080 --> 12:32.170
say, "Aloha."

12:32.170 --> 12:34.420
I got it
on my honeymoon
in Hawaii.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.960
(chuckles)
Yeah, your marriage
was hanging on by a thread,

12:36.960 --> 12:38.830
and so is this shirt.
(laughs)

12:38.830 --> 12:41.580
Guess that's why you're
getting divorced from that too.

12:41.580 --> 12:43.460
(laughs)

12:43.460 --> 12:46.330
When is the last time you
wore that sweater?

12:46.330 --> 12:48.670
Right now.
Right now. Right now.

12:48.670 --> 12:50.580
I'm wearing it right now.
Right now.

12:55.250 --> 12:57.120
Hey, what happened
to you? I waited
for you after school

12:57.120 --> 12:58.250
and you never showed up.

12:58.250 --> 13:00.080
-(video game noises)
-Yup.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.000
And I waited
for you at lunch too.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.330
Yup.

13:05.290 --> 13:06.960
Hold on.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.830
You didn't forget, did you?

13:08.830 --> 13:10.460
You didn't show up
on purpose.

13:10.460 --> 13:11.830
Yup.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.620
I can't believe
you just blowed
me off like that.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.750
You didn't
give me a choice.

13:17.750 --> 13:19.540
Every time you're
around Curtis and The Guntz,

13:19.540 --> 13:22.170
you blab something about me and
I get a new nickname.

13:22.170 --> 13:23.960
So you just left me hanging?

13:23.960 --> 13:25.500
What kind
of Franken Buddy
are you?

13:25.500 --> 13:27.210
The kind who wants
to eat lunch,

13:27.210 --> 13:29.830
or walk home with my friends
without you embarrassing me.

13:29.830 --> 13:32.580
Embarrassing you?
What do you mean?
Today I defended you.

13:32.580 --> 13:34.750
Which is embarrassing!

13:34.750 --> 13:38.250
Having you fight
my battles and telling
my boys I'm sensitive--

13:38.250 --> 13:40.120
you're wrecking my game!

13:40.120 --> 13:43.120
So just back off, okay?
I need my space!

13:43.120 --> 13:45.960
You want your space?
You got it!

13:45.960 --> 13:47.500
-I'm moving out.
-You can't do that!

13:47.500 --> 13:49.960
-Why not?
-Because I'm kicking you out!

14:03.040 --> 14:06.120
Hi. I'm Levi,
and I'm a dissed sib.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.210
Kids:
Hi, Levi.

14:16.460 --> 14:19.460
So, Levi, is there
anything you'd like
to share with the group?

14:19.460 --> 14:21.120
I brought guac!

14:22.620 --> 14:23.920
I meant your story.

14:23.920 --> 14:26.830
Okay, well,
Booker and I are
like brothers,

14:26.830 --> 14:29.830
-and usually he's really cool.
-But...?

14:29.830 --> 14:32.540
-But then he blew
me off for lunch...
-(kids gasp)

14:32.540 --> 14:35.500
-...and our walk
home from school.
-(kids gasp)

14:35.500 --> 14:38.580
And last night...
we got into a fight,

14:38.580 --> 14:41.290
and now we're
not even sleeping
in the same room.

14:41.290 --> 14:44.120
-Kids: Ooh.
-We've all been there,

14:44.120 --> 14:46.670
which is why
I asked everyone
at the last meeting

14:46.670 --> 14:50.420
for suggestions
on what we can do
to make the dissing stop.

14:50.420 --> 14:53.620
And the top three were...
"Ignore them,"

14:53.620 --> 14:57.210
"Tell our moms,"
and "Make this
face at them."

14:59.330 --> 15:01.250
So, we'll now take a vote

15:01.250 --> 15:02.670
on which one
of those things we'll do.

15:04.670 --> 15:05.830
That's it?

15:09.330 --> 15:12.540
I don't know, guys.
Maybe it's because
my wounds are fresh,

15:12.540 --> 15:15.790
but I feel like revenge
is the way to go here.

15:16.830 --> 15:18.790
Hmm. "Revenge."

15:18.790 --> 15:20.540
I like it.

15:20.540 --> 15:22.290
Okay. New vote.

15:22.290 --> 15:24.960
All in favor of Levi
leading the revolution?

15:24.960 --> 15:27.040
Kids:
Levi! Levi!

15:27.040 --> 15:29.380
(whispers)
Shh! Ms. Pittman
doesn't know we're in here.

15:29.380 --> 15:33.170
(kids whispering)
Levi! Levi! Levi! Levi!

15:37.960 --> 15:41.000
Thank you.
Aunt Chelsea,
this is going great.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.540
We should have
everything sold in no time.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.080
Yeah, yeah.

15:49.250 --> 15:52.080
Oh. Ah. Hawaii. Yeah.

15:52.080 --> 15:54.790
Yeah. Gosh, that was
the sweatiest trip ever,

15:54.790 --> 15:57.040
but that shirt was a lifesaver.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.170
It just absorbed everything.

15:59.170 --> 16:00.420
(chuckles)

16:00.420 --> 16:01.960
(whispers)
Yes!

16:01.960 --> 16:03.540
Really, Aunt Chelsea?

16:03.540 --> 16:05.380
Even my mom
wouldn't stoop this low.

16:05.380 --> 16:08.040
Give it. You--
you just gonna
take this shirt

16:08.040 --> 16:09.830
from an old lady?

16:11.170 --> 16:15.040
Well, I... don't even have
enough time to enjoy it!

16:15.040 --> 16:17.380
(hacking cough)

16:22.380 --> 16:23.620
Really, Mom?

16:25.330 --> 16:26.250
I ain't your mama.

16:27.830 --> 16:31.380
-Yeah? Yeah, yeah?
You're not my ma? Then...
-Oh. Oh.

16:32.420 --> 16:34.960
...why do you want
my mom's T-shirt that
says, "Fueled by rap"?

16:34.960 --> 16:36.960
Oh, well, sweetie-pie,

16:36.960 --> 16:39.460
you know, that's-- that's
because I'm a rapper.

16:39.460 --> 16:42.500
(laughs)
You know, the kids,
they call me--

16:42.500 --> 16:44.250
they call me Nana Minaj.

16:45.620 --> 16:48.750
'cause I'm like a rapping.
Ficki, ficki, ficki napping.

16:50.380 --> 16:51.540
Takes a lot out of you.

16:56.000 --> 16:58.420
I'm just gonna take my nap
right here, baby.

16:58.420 --> 17:01.330
-Okay, I think we're done here.
-No, no, no! (sobs)

17:01.330 --> 17:03.750
She's young!
I'm old! I'm an old lady!

17:03.750 --> 17:07.040
Now, Rae, you heard her!
Outta here, huh? Outta here!

17:07.040 --> 17:09.540
-You too, Aunt Chelsea!
-Fine! Fine!

17:09.540 --> 17:11.250
I'm going! I'm going!

17:11.250 --> 17:12.880
I used to love that scarf...

17:12.880 --> 17:14.330
until it gave me lice.

17:25.670 --> 17:29.750
Don't worry, Tanner.
I've come up with the perfect
plan to get back at Booker.

17:29.750 --> 17:33.000
Tomorrow in science class,
he won't know what hit him,

17:33.000 --> 17:37.170
but hit him, It--
will my homework
be done by tomorrow?

17:37.170 --> 17:39.540
-Absolutely. Bye.
-(beeps)

17:39.540 --> 17:41.080
What are you doing here?

17:41.080 --> 17:44.460
Can't sleep,
and Franken Crunch
always chills me out.

17:44.460 --> 17:46.790
Well, Franken Crunch
that in your room.

17:46.790 --> 17:49.420
You know my mom
doesn't let me eat in my room.

17:49.420 --> 17:51.380
Well, you can't eat
in mine either.

17:51.380 --> 17:53.330
-Says who?
-Says me.

17:53.330 --> 17:55.420
-Oh yeah?
-(crunching)

17:55.420 --> 17:57.330
-(burps)
-Ah!

17:57.330 --> 17:58.620
That was funny
when you did it to Nia,

17:58.620 --> 18:00.210
but it's gross
when you do it to me.

18:00.210 --> 18:02.790
Well, your crunching
is annoying when you
do it to me.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.500
-(crunching)
-(burping)

18:10.080 --> 18:11.580
Rae, this is
getting serious.

18:11.580 --> 18:13.080
I think we should
do something.

18:13.080 --> 18:16.080
Oh, Chels, come on,
how many times have we had
this exact same fight?

18:16.080 --> 18:18.380
-And look at us.
-(burps)

18:18.380 --> 18:20.460
Good point. Yeah.

18:22.170 --> 18:24.000
(crunching and burping
continues)

18:27.210 --> 18:28.920
I can't believe
this used to fun.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.250
Okay, everyone, we're ready
for our science presentations.

18:43.250 --> 18:45.830
First up, Booker Baxter.

18:45.830 --> 18:49.790
Okay, Booker,
give it a little solar flare.

18:54.790 --> 18:57.170
Thanks, Ms. Pittman! Okay.

18:58.420 --> 19:01.620
Today I will be
doing the elephant
toothpaste experiment,

19:01.620 --> 19:04.210
where I will demonstrate
a chemical reaction

19:04.210 --> 19:06.500
when a catalyst,
my yeast mixture,

19:06.500 --> 19:09.250
removes oxygen
from this hydrogen peroxide.

19:13.580 --> 19:15.920
You did it, Levi.
You got revenge on Booker.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.540
His science experiment
totally blew up in his face.

19:23.580 --> 19:26.580
Booker, your presentation?

19:26.580 --> 19:28.670
Uh, Ms. Pittman,

19:28.670 --> 19:31.000
I would like to ask a student
to come up and assist me.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.580
Sure. Who would like to help
Booker with his presentation?

19:36.040 --> 19:37.830
Ha! Levi it is!

19:37.830 --> 19:40.540
Me? I didn't even
raise my hand.

19:40.540 --> 19:42.620
Nah, I saw your pinky move.

19:42.620 --> 19:45.460
Go on, Levi,
make a quantum leap.

19:45.460 --> 19:47.040
(laughs)
Just...

19:53.580 --> 19:55.540
(whispers)
I know you rigged this
to get back at me.

19:55.540 --> 19:57.500
What? I didn't
do anything.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.920
Oh yeah?
Well, I had a vision
that says otherwise.

19:59.920 --> 20:03.710
Fine. I was going to,
but I just couldn't do it.

20:03.710 --> 20:05.500
I don't believe you.

20:06.500 --> 20:09.380
My assistant will now
take a step closer
to the beaker...

20:10.330 --> 20:14.210
while I pour
some of the yeast
mixture into it.

20:14.210 --> 20:15.920
Pittman:
Safety goggles on.

20:18.670 --> 20:20.420
(laughs)

20:22.210 --> 20:25.620
I told you
nothing's gonna happen,
because I didn't do anything.

20:25.620 --> 20:27.330
Oh yeah?
Well, then you won't mind

20:27.330 --> 20:28.580
if I pour
a little more in there.

20:28.580 --> 20:31.460
-I wouldn't if I were you.
-Well, you're not me.

20:35.120 --> 20:36.580
(bubbling)

20:36.580 --> 20:37.670
Uh-oh.

20:38.580 --> 20:39.790
Oh!

20:52.710 --> 20:54.620
Look! It's the
Bubblebeard Brothers!

20:54.620 --> 20:56.210
(laughter)

21:05.420 --> 21:07.170
So, you really didn't
do anything?

21:07.170 --> 21:11.290
No. I don't want
to ruin our relationship
over one little fight.

21:11.290 --> 21:14.080
That still doesn't
explain my vision.

21:14.080 --> 21:16.290
You did it, Levi.
You got revenge
on Booker.

21:16.290 --> 21:18.920
His science experiment
totally blew up in his face.

21:18.920 --> 21:20.960
In your face, Booker!

21:22.500 --> 21:25.920
Huh. My vision played out
differently than I thought.

21:27.080 --> 21:28.500
What made you
change your mind?

21:29.540 --> 21:31.580
After our Crunch-burp fight
last night...

21:32.620 --> 21:36.500
I saw my Berry Buddy cereal box
alone on the counter...

21:36.500 --> 21:39.620
and it just didn't look right
without your Franken Crunch.

21:41.290 --> 21:43.620
I didn't mean
to get so mad, Levi.

21:43.620 --> 21:46.580
I like being your brother
and your roommate.

21:46.580 --> 21:50.420
It's just... I'm older and I
have my own friends...

21:51.380 --> 21:53.250
and sometimes
I need my own space.

21:54.290 --> 21:55.790
It's cool. I get it.

21:55.790 --> 21:58.120
We don't have to do
everything together.

21:58.120 --> 22:01.620
And if you want,
I can even go back
to my old science class.

22:01.620 --> 22:03.790
No, that's not what I want.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.380
You deserve
to be in this class.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.620
Then how about I just switch
seats with that pretty girl
you like in the front row?

22:10.620 --> 22:13.120
Molly Gillespie? Deal!

22:15.960 --> 22:19.120
Boys, Principal Wentworth
will see you now.

22:19.120 --> 22:23.380
I hope you realize
the gravity of the situation.
(chuckles)

22:29.330 --> 22:30.920
Looks like we're
both gonna get it.

22:30.920 --> 22:33.750
At least we gonna
get it together.

22:33.750 --> 22:36.500
-Come on,
Franken Buddy.
-Let's go.

22:40.250 --> 22:41.500
-Knock, knock.
-Oh, hey.

22:41.500 --> 22:42.830
Hey, sweetheart.

22:42.830 --> 22:45.880
Nia, I just wanna thank you
for helping us de-clutter.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.500
I mean, honestly,
it's like a weight

22:47.500 --> 22:48.960
has been lifted
off my shoulders.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.080
and being able to donate
all the leftover clothes

22:51.080 --> 22:53.290
to the women's shelter made me
feel even better.

22:53.290 --> 22:54.670
I'm really glad
I could help.
(chuckles)

22:54.670 --> 22:55.960
Mmm.

22:55.960 --> 22:58.170
Oh! No, Mom,
I'll put my
clothes away.

22:58.170 --> 22:59.880
Oh no,
it's okay,
sweetheart.

22:59.880 --> 23:00.670
Don't worry
about it.
I mean,

23:00.670 --> 23:02.580
after all that you did for us,
I got you, girl.

23:02.580 --> 23:03.960
Mom, just-- I don't...

23:08.170 --> 23:10.670
Chels! Get three boxes!

23:10.670 --> 23:12.620
We about to have a garage sale!
