00:05.600 --> 00:09.600
Synchro 1080p: Pele144

00:11.000 --> 00:16.350
Tonight, James experiences the sheer
grunt of a Chevrolet Silverado.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.710
I go airborne in a Ford Velociraptor.

00:18.760 --> 00:21.560
And Richard Hammond
carries some wood.

00:28.240 --> 00:29.990
Hello!

00:30.040 --> 00:32.390
Hello, and good evening.

00:32.439 --> 00:34.040
Hello. Now...

00:35.880 --> 00:40.150
Thank you very much. A while
back I heard that Lexus

00:40.200 --> 00:43.110
was working on a car called the RCF.

00:43.160 --> 00:47.790
It would be a two-door coupe
with a five-litre V8 engine

00:47.840 --> 00:53.030
and it would take on the smaller
AMG Mercs and M-powered BMWs.

00:53.080 --> 00:54.790
And I was very excited.

00:54.840 --> 00:58.310
I couldn't wait to give it
a spanking round our track.

00:58.360 --> 01:00.350
And now I have.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074

01:10.400 --> 01:14.080
I expected it to be
sharp... but violent.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.950
Raw, but civilised.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.520
Powerful, but controlled.

01:31.960 --> 01:34.880
I expected a bank of Tokyo hi tech...

01:36.960 --> 01:39.760
.. with the exhaust
bark of a mad dog.

01:41.960 --> 01:45.840
But actually it turned
out to be fat and useless.

01:48.480 --> 01:49.910
REALLY fat.

01:49.960 --> 01:53.600
With two people on board,
it weighs nearly two tonnes.

01:55.320 --> 02:00.710
So look what happens when you put
it in a drag race with a BMW M4.

02:03.240 --> 02:05.350
Three... two... one...

02:05.400 --> 02:06.560
go!

02:10.400 --> 02:13.480
The BMW just walks away.

02:15.960 --> 02:20.920
I have 40 more horsepower than
he does and I'm being humiliated!

02:26.800 --> 02:30.520
The enormous weight means it's
no good in the corners, either.

02:32.160 --> 02:35.670
I have got many, many
different settings in here

02:35.720 --> 02:40.470
and I've got G-SHIFT control,
whatever that is.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.910
And VDIM.

02:42.960 --> 02:48.270
I've got STANDARD, ECO, SPORT S,

02:48.320 --> 02:51.910
SPORT S+, something called SLALOM.

02:51.960 --> 02:54.670
Doesn't matter which one you select,

02:54.720 --> 02:57.150
you just get yards and yards

02:57.200 --> 02:59.350
of wearisome understeer

02:59.400 --> 03:03.430
and then a lot of
electronic interference.

03:03.480 --> 03:06.670
There is, however, another
setting in the RCF

03:06.720 --> 03:08.990
which makes it even worse.

03:09.040 --> 03:13.470
If you put it in SPORT+ and
then push this button here...

03:13.520 --> 03:15.950
Look! I'm now in EXPERT mode.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.790
It says it there.

03:17.840 --> 03:21.230
I have told the car
that I am an expert.

03:21.280 --> 03:24.880
I don't need the electronic
stuff, I can manage.

03:28.160 --> 03:29.500
Oh, God!

03:34.160 --> 03:38.040
Lurchy. That's the word I'm
looking for there. Lurchy.

03:42.920 --> 03:45.990
It's really struggling
to deal with the weight.

03:46.040 --> 03:47.380
Come on!

03:49.240 --> 03:51.310
Why are you doing that?!

03:51.840 --> 03:54.880
I'm an expert, look. Look how
I'm going round this corner.

03:56.200 --> 03:59.200
That's an expert use of the
- Oh, I'm on the grass.

04:00.680 --> 04:05.310
The simple truth of the matter
is you can put John Prescott

04:05.360 --> 04:07.790
in a pair of running shoes...

04:07.840 --> 04:10.380
but it won't make him an athlete.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.310
I really don't like this car.

04:13.360 --> 04:16.190
I don't like the way it looks,
I don't like the way it goes,

04:16.240 --> 04:18.640
I don't like the way it feels.

04:19.399 --> 04:21.230
But what really annoys me,

04:21.279 --> 04:23.590
what really gets my goat

04:23.640 --> 04:28.200
is that I know Lexus
can do so much better.

04:38.080 --> 04:40.960
A few years ago, they
gave us the LFA.

04:43.560 --> 04:48.280
A car which, I'll admit, has
many faults and irritations.

04:52.240 --> 04:57.270
The seat belt, for example, is
incredibly difficult to do up. Um...

04:57.320 --> 05:00.510
There are no cup holders, it's
impossible to plug your telephone

05:00.560 --> 05:03.190
or whatever into the stereo system,

05:03.240 --> 05:05.910
and the fuel tank is the size
of a disposable lighter,

05:05.960 --> 05:08.390
which means you have to fill
up every five minutes,

05:08.440 --> 05:10.350
and then you have to get out,

05:10.400 --> 05:13.550
and then it takes you a week
to do your seat belt up again.

05:13.600 --> 05:16.190
I still haven't done it!

05:16.240 --> 05:19.110
It's like giving myself
a prostate exam.

05:20.600 --> 05:24.590
But these little things
pale into insignificance

05:24.640 --> 05:28.320
when you unleash its
astonishing V10 engine.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.720
It produces 552 horsepower.

05:44.080 --> 05:48.680
That means 0 to 60 in 3.7 seconds.

05:59.720 --> 06:03.390
It also means a top speed of 202,

06:03.440 --> 06:08.030
and even more amazingly, it
revs from idle to the red line

06:08.080 --> 06:12.480
in an almost unbelievable
0.6 of a second.

06:18.720 --> 06:22.350
But the best thing is the noise.

06:24.840 --> 06:28.150
It sounds baleful, it sounds
like a wild animal that's...

06:28.200 --> 06:30.140
sad about something.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.830
"Oh, nooooooooo!

06:34.880 --> 06:37.070
"I've got my paw stuck!

06:37.120 --> 06:38.830
"Ow!

06:38.880 --> 06:41.150
"Ow!

06:41.200 --> 06:42.950
"Ow!"

06:43.000 --> 06:47.030
This is what I was looking
for in the new Lexus,

06:47.080 --> 06:51.840
a sense that the engine is actually
alive, that it's a sentient being.

06:53.360 --> 06:56.300
And there was more I
was looking for, too.

06:57.800 --> 07:01.030
The LFA does not have
an EXPERT facility,

07:01.080 --> 07:04.240
or a G-SHIFT thing, or VDIM.

07:07.800 --> 07:11.600
It corners well because
it's well engineered.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.600
And it's light - very light.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.640
And I love the way that it
feels so violent and raw.

07:40.040 --> 07:43.080
This car is simply out of this world.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.750
And look at the
difference in styling.

07:50.800 --> 07:54.990
See how one looks like that stupid
food that's drizzled in jus

07:55.040 --> 07:56.830
and served on a bed of stupid beans

07:56.880 --> 08:00.710
to idiots in over-priced restaurants.

08:00.760 --> 08:04.560
And the other is as simple as
a freshly picked blackberry.

08:07.640 --> 08:13.470
I know that this costs five or
six times more than the new RCF,

08:13.520 --> 08:17.230
and I know it's full of carbon fibre
and all sorts of clever engineering

08:17.280 --> 08:20.430
that you can't reasonably
expect to find

08:20.480 --> 08:23.110
further down the fiscal food chain,

08:23.160 --> 08:28.630
but surely they could have captured
the spirit of this car, the essence,

08:28.680 --> 08:32.990
its soul, and transplanted
that into the RCF.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.840
Surely they could.

08:37.120 --> 08:40.309
Or maybe they couldn't.

08:40.360 --> 08:43.190
Maybe the LFA is so good,

08:43.240 --> 08:47.600
not even the people who made
it know how to make it again.

08:58.640 --> 09:02.510
~ Um, you said you were going
to give it a spanking.
~ Yeah.

09:02.560 --> 09:04.150
But you gave it a kicking.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.950
Well, it's rubbish. It is absolutely
rubbish. In fact, it's so bad

09:07.000 --> 09:09.350
I'm not even going to bother
getting the Stig to take it

09:09.400 --> 09:11.990
round the track, it would just
be a complete waste of time.

09:12.040 --> 09:15.390
Oh, now, we ought to bring you up to
speed with the latest in car news.

09:15.440 --> 09:16.670
Okie-doke.

09:16.720 --> 09:19.670
A new Skoda coming out,
it's called the Superb.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.710
There it is, mainly for mini cabbers.

09:21.760 --> 09:24.030
But what you really need
to know is underneath,

09:24.080 --> 09:26.510
if you peel away the body,
it's basically a Golf, OK?

09:26.560 --> 09:31.710
There's another new Skoda, the Octavia
vRS, that's a Golf as well.

09:31.760 --> 09:34.230
New Audi, RS3 Sportback, here it is.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.590
That's a Golf.

09:36.640 --> 09:39.750
~ New Skoda Fabia.
~ Ah, is that a Golf?
~ No, that's a Polo.

09:39.800 --> 09:42.630
~ Is it? Oh, it's confusing.
~ It's not confusing.
~ It is.

09:42.680 --> 09:44.790
No, it's not, it's
really, really simple.

09:44.840 --> 09:48.590
All cars are basically a
Golf underneath, or a Polo,

09:48.640 --> 09:51.070
or a Fiat 500,

09:51.120 --> 09:55.070
except for this, this
is the Citroen DS5,

09:55.120 --> 09:58.070
that's basically a
Peugeot, underneath.

09:58.120 --> 10:00.350
And the Fiat 500X, that.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.990
~ Well, is that not a Fiat 500?
~ No, that's an Alfa Romeo.
~ Is it?

10:04.040 --> 10:07.230
Anyway, that's cleared up this
week's motoring news for you.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.910
Moving on, do you remember
that six-wheeled

10:09.960 --> 10:12.550
Mercedes G Wagon that I drove?
The six-wheel drive thing.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.950
~ Yes, in the desert, yes, yes.
~ Yeah, a massive thing.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.470
Well, Mercedes have now
announced that they're making

10:17.520 --> 10:19.230
a four-wheel version of it.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.310
~ Oh, there it is.
~ There, look at that.

10:21.360 --> 10:24.350
So they've made a four-wheeled
version of the six-wheeled version

10:24.400 --> 10:27.750
~ of the four-wheel car they already had.
~ I think it looks great.

10:27.800 --> 10:31.790
Massive wheels made possible by
portal axles so it's raised up,

10:31.840 --> 10:34.390
it's got about 422 brake
horsepower, I think it is,

10:34.440 --> 10:36.350
from its V8 twin turbo.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.110
It is quite costly.

10:38.160 --> 10:40.470
Â£200,000 for that.

10:40.520 --> 10:46.590
I know, I know, but if you look closely
it's got side pipes! Oh, yes!

10:46.640 --> 10:49.270
And all of a sudden, ladies
and gentlemen, Richard Hammond

10:49.320 --> 10:51.510
has become uncomfortable
in his trousers.

10:51.560 --> 10:54.030
Well, I love... I do love side pipes.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.190
I can tell that from the
shape of your front pipe!

10:56.240 --> 10:58.430
Oh, is it showing? Sorry.

10:58.480 --> 11:02.070
Oh, now, there's a sort of
motor racing, it's called GT3,

11:02.120 --> 11:04.070
~ anyone seen it?
~ Yeah.

11:04.120 --> 11:07.230
There's a picture of a grid here.
Look at it, it's just amazing -

11:07.280 --> 11:11.670
Astons, McLarens, Porches, BMWs,
Nissan GT-Rs, fabulous series.

11:11.720 --> 11:14.390
Yeah, very exciting because
you can recognise the cars.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.350
But now Bentley has announced that
they're going to build a car

11:17.400 --> 11:20.070
that's inspired by that race series.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.350
It's called the GT3-R, here it is.

11:22.400 --> 11:26.030
And it's a sort of stripped-down,
pumped-up, road-going,

11:26.080 --> 11:31.070
two-seater version of the race
car. 580 horsepower, from its V8.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.550
I like the look of that.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.510
And, well, you'll like the sound,
because it's got a titanium exhaust

11:35.560 --> 11:38.190
that they say gives
it a baritone roar.

11:38.240 --> 11:39.750
So it's got Tom Jones underneath it.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.750
~ Basically, they've strapped Tom Jones...
~ Poor Tom, "Whoa!"

11:42.800 --> 11:45.710
~ That's how it sounds.
~ Aston Martin have got a very similar

11:45.760 --> 11:47.950
sort of thing, called
a Vantage V12 GT3.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.070
Oooh!

11:49.120 --> 11:52.110
~ Exactly, whoa, that is a V12, obviously.
~ Does look quite cool.

11:52.160 --> 11:54.630
600 horsepower, so 20
more than the Bentley

11:54.680 --> 11:56.430
and it's half a tonne lighter.

11:56.480 --> 12:00.350
That is properly blowing
my frock up, that thing.

12:00.400 --> 12:03.310
It really is. Philosophy news...

12:03.360 --> 12:07.870
Everybody - no, don't groan, because
I know it sounds dreary but...

12:07.920 --> 12:11.750
~ driverless cars are coming, as we know.
~ Yeah.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.510
And somebody pointed out this week,

12:13.560 --> 12:15.470
and I think it's rather a good point,

12:15.520 --> 12:19.070
that they will have to make, from
time to time, ethical decisions.

12:19.120 --> 12:22.110
What, like, should we
cancel Third World debt?

12:22.160 --> 12:24.710
No, James, not that. You're
driving along, OK?

12:24.760 --> 12:27.750
And you're heading towards an accident.
You're not driving, you're

12:27.800 --> 12:30.470
sitting there. You're heading
towards an accident, it's going

12:30.520 --> 12:33.150
to be fatal. The only solution
is to swerve onto the pavement,

12:33.200 --> 12:35.430
but there are two pedestrians there.

12:35.480 --> 12:37.750
What does the car do?

12:37.800 --> 12:40.150
Wow, is this the Moral
Maze or something?

12:40.200 --> 12:41.830
No, it's a genuine thing.

12:41.880 --> 12:45.830
Cos basically you will have bought
a car that must be programmed,

12:45.880 --> 12:49.470
in certain circumstances,
to kill you. It will go,

12:49.520 --> 12:52.230
"Well, there's two there, there's
only one person in me,

12:52.280 --> 12:55.190
"I'm going to kill him." And you'll
just have to sit there, as the lorry

12:55.240 --> 12:58.110
~ comes and there's nothing you can do.
~ Well, maybe driverless cars

12:58.160 --> 13:01.030
will have to come with,
like, an override button.

13:01.080 --> 13:04.310
Just a big button with "ME" on
it. So, in a crash - save me!

13:04.360 --> 13:06.990
~ Just hit that.
~ Or maybe it could have a sliding scale.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.830
So you can say, look, if there's
a load of children on the pavement

13:09.880 --> 13:13.360
obviously don't run them
down, but cyclists...

13:15.400 --> 13:19.150
We are in dark territory
here, aren't we?

13:19.200 --> 13:22.750
Well, the interesting thing
is, all of us are programmed,

13:22.800 --> 13:25.350
because we're humans, cos
we're animals, basically,

13:25.400 --> 13:28.110
to look after ourselves.
Self-preservation always kicks in

13:28.160 --> 13:31.670
~ and you will swerve away from danger.
~ Not necessarily.

13:31.720 --> 13:34.830
Oh, well, now you say that, but
recently scientists conducted

13:34.880 --> 13:37.390
an absolutely awful, genuinely
awful experiment,

13:37.440 --> 13:39.190
but with a very interesting result.

13:39.240 --> 13:42.190
They got a load of monkeys with their
babies and put them in a box.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.790
And then they heated the floor
up - this actually happened -

13:44.840 --> 13:46.830
I, you know, I'm just reporting.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.350
They heated the floor up till
it became really unbearable

13:49.400 --> 13:53.590
and all of the monkeys picked
up their babies and held them.

13:53.640 --> 13:56.910
But when the floor got hotter and
hotter until it was absolutely

13:56.960 --> 14:00.430
unbearable, every one of them put
the babies down and stood on them.

14:02.560 --> 14:05.070
I'm... I'm surprised...

14:05.120 --> 14:08.350
I'm surprised you didn't save this
for the Christmas show, mate.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.870
What a lovely story,
what a nice tale(!)

14:12.920 --> 14:14.190
I love a story!

14:14.240 --> 14:17.270
I'm just saying, these driverless
cars, everybody goes,

14:17.320 --> 14:19.430
"Aren't they clever? They
can stop at red lights."

14:19.480 --> 14:21.710
They are going to have to
face all sorts of things,

14:21.760 --> 14:23.030
like who do I kill now?

14:23.080 --> 14:26.110
We are programmed to look after
ourselves and these driverless cars

14:26.160 --> 14:28.430
are going to be programmed
to do the maths and say,

14:28.480 --> 14:30.990
"A lot of people over there,
I'm going to kill you."

14:31.040 --> 14:33.840
And whether to stand
on a baby monkey.

14:35.760 --> 14:39.630
Now, Brooklands, world's first
purpose-built racetrack,

14:39.680 --> 14:41.750
~ do you remember it?
~ Well, no. He will.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.230
Oh, yeah, he will, obviously.

14:43.280 --> 14:45.590
We've got some footage of
it here to remind everyone.

14:45.640 --> 14:47.630
This was just outside
London, and look at it,

14:47.680 --> 14:50.470
everybody walked fast and were
in black and white in those days.

14:50.520 --> 14:54.390
And you went unbelievable - look
at this, 120mph on the banking.

14:54.440 --> 14:57.670
And then there's James May,
look, in his pedal car.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.950
And then it was just fantastic.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.990
But the war started, they built an
aeroplane factory on the circuit

15:04.040 --> 15:05.590
and that was the end of that.

15:05.640 --> 15:08.750
Ever since, there's been a group
of enthusiasts who want Brooklands

15:08.800 --> 15:11.950
to reopen, and last week, actually,
they were given a grant

15:12.000 --> 15:15.030
by the lottery people
of Â£4.6 million.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.390
And I just think that's going to be
brilliant. Get that back - Astons,

15:18.440 --> 15:20.710
Bentleys belting around
at the weekend,

15:20.760 --> 15:24.670
Fotherington Sorbet wheel-to-wheel
with the Duke of Wyndham.

15:24.720 --> 15:27.270
It's a very good idea for an
appealing Sunday afternoon,

15:27.320 --> 15:29.710
watching the toffs kill themselves.

15:29.760 --> 15:32.030
You just pop down the A3
on a Sunday afternoon,

15:32.080 --> 15:35.190
"Let's go and watch the Earl
of Bradford's head come off."

15:35.240 --> 15:38.150
~ How much did you say they'd been given?
~ Â£4.6 million.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.150
Well, that's not enough, is it? The
shopping centre next to our office

15:41.200 --> 15:44.510
~ cost one and a half billion.
~ Yes, exactly, it isn't very much,

15:44.560 --> 15:46.550
you're quite right,
well spotted, Hammond.

15:46.600 --> 15:49.630
In fact, all they can afford
to do with that is rebuild

15:49.680 --> 15:52.190
the start/finish straight.

15:52.240 --> 15:55.310
Hang on, just the start/finish
straight of a race circuit

15:55.360 --> 15:57.270
~ is not much use in itself.
~ No.

15:57.320 --> 16:01.270
Unless they spend all 4.6
million on lottery tickets.

16:01.320 --> 16:04.350
It's lottery money, they can take the
grant, spend it on lottery tickets

16:04.400 --> 16:07.950
~ and win a lot more.
~ Good thinking from Richard Hammond there,

16:08.000 --> 16:11.150
he's saved motor racing
for the nation.

16:11.200 --> 16:15.150
Now, I know this is a car show,
but please bear with us,

16:15.200 --> 16:16.790
because I want to talk about this.

16:16.840 --> 16:20.310
It's one of those watches
that's worn by people

16:20.360 --> 16:22.150
who play golf and do business.

16:22.200 --> 16:27.070
And they're always banging on about
these pins that you can see here.

16:27.120 --> 16:31.430
Yeah, they say that if they pull
those pins out, the watch will send

16:31.480 --> 16:34.110
their precise position
to a team of professionals

16:34.160 --> 16:36.270
who will come and rescue them.

16:36.320 --> 16:39.710
So, if they're out climbing a mountain
or rowing across an ocean...

16:39.760 --> 16:42.470
Which they aren't, cos they're
playing golf and doing business.

16:42.520 --> 16:45.270
But if they were doing those things,
and something went wrong,

16:45.320 --> 16:49.390
~ then thanks to their watch, they'd be OK.
~ Ah, but would they?

16:49.440 --> 16:53.070
To find out, the producers decided
that one of us should be dumped

16:53.120 --> 16:56.230
somewhere with minimal kit,
with virtually no food,

16:56.280 --> 17:00.840
somewhere very, very remote
to see if the system works.

17:36.840 --> 17:38.180
Well...

17:40.400 --> 17:42.270
.. that's it.

17:42.320 --> 17:46.470
I am now marooned here,

17:46.520 --> 17:48.720
wherever the hell here is.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.100
Bloody hell.

17:56.120 --> 18:00.190
My only hope now is my watch.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.920
So... it's time.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.040
Undo this.

18:07.640 --> 18:09.670
There.

18:09.720 --> 18:12.060
And then pull that bit out...

18:13.280 --> 18:15.200
And that's it done.

18:18.120 --> 18:22.270
Pulling those pins activates a
distress signal that's picked up

18:22.320 --> 18:25.190
by a LEOSAR - Low Earth
Polar Orbit Satellite -

18:25.240 --> 18:27.950
which then forwards
my exact coordinates

18:28.000 --> 18:30.230
to a central command centre.

18:30.280 --> 18:33.510
The team here then scramble
the nearest highly-trained

18:33.560 --> 18:37.880
search and rescue unit, who arrive
at my location within hours.

18:40.920 --> 18:46.310
Sadly, however, today the scramble
command has not been sent

18:46.360 --> 18:49.360
to a highly-trained search
and rescue unit.

19:00.480 --> 19:01.910
.. running on petrol.

19:01.960 --> 19:05.070
It's a brilliant idea, and I'm
not sure the Ferrari does that.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.870
I think it does, but I think they're
just being honest about it cos

19:07.920 --> 19:10.830
they're recognising that it's a
means of improving the efficiency.

19:10.880 --> 19:13.590
Is that your bag ringing?

19:13.640 --> 19:16.870
Oh, I think this is the signal
from our esteemed colleague

19:16.920 --> 19:19.110
~ Richard Hammond.
~ Is it? Where is he?

19:19.160 --> 19:23.030
Wait a minute. He would appear
to be in... Africa, is it?

19:23.080 --> 19:24.880
Let's have a look.

19:25.440 --> 19:28.630
No, I think you'll find that is...

19:28.680 --> 19:30.270
Canada.

19:30.320 --> 19:32.910
Specifically the Rockies.

19:32.960 --> 19:36.350
Crikey! Um... actually,
that is quite serious.

19:36.400 --> 19:40.830
We really do need to get on
this, James, so, excuse me...

19:40.880 --> 19:43.280
could we see the pudding menu?

19:44.400 --> 19:45.740
Right...

19:46.520 --> 19:50.360
.. that bit suspends off this bit.

19:53.880 --> 19:56.960
That watch transmits for 24 hours.

19:58.800 --> 20:00.670
And then that's it.

20:03.400 --> 20:08.230
Right, so this is the
mountain, there's my tent.

20:08.280 --> 20:11.430
Mountain, trees, hills.
This is all we are.

20:11.480 --> 20:13.430
There's a cameraman,
a sound recordist

20:13.480 --> 20:16.470
and a bloke from the office
and he's just a media luvvie.

20:16.520 --> 20:20.310
I know you think there's
a five-star hotel

20:20.360 --> 20:23.190
just down there, but there's not.

20:23.240 --> 20:26.440
Nothing else. There's no
survival experts here.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.830
Fact of the matter is I'm
completely stuck until

20:29.880 --> 20:32.480
Yogi the boar and Boo-Boo get here.

20:34.600 --> 20:36.590
Knowing we were his only hope,

20:36.640 --> 20:39.350
we had some important
decisions to make.

20:39.400 --> 20:43.510
Raunchy apple fritters sounds quite
interesting. Or pancake with cheese.

20:43.560 --> 20:45.230
James, James, James.

20:45.280 --> 20:48.670
You know in the colonies, Australia,
South Africa, America,

20:48.720 --> 20:52.470
~ Canada and so on, everybody
loves pick-up trucks, yes?
~ Yes.

20:52.520 --> 20:56.350
Well, why don't we get a pick-up
truck to go and rescue Hammond in?

20:56.400 --> 20:58.830
Because pick-up trucks generally
only have two seats

20:58.880 --> 21:01.470
and there would be three of
us when we've rescued him.

21:01.520 --> 21:04.190
Why don't we get two pick-up
trucks, one for you, one for me?

21:04.240 --> 21:06.950
It would A, increase our
chances of finding him,

21:07.000 --> 21:10.790
~ and B, there'd be a seat to get him back in.
~ But...

21:10.840 --> 21:16.670
In Thunderbirds, inevitably
1 and 2 kind of went first,

21:16.720 --> 21:18.630
~ didn't they, always.
~ Yeah.

21:18.680 --> 21:23.070
Alan and... No, not Alan - who
drove Thunderbird 1? Scott.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.310
~ Virgil.
~ No, Virgil was 2.

21:25.360 --> 21:28.630
~ Was he 2?
~ Scott was 1,

21:28.680 --> 21:30.710
Virgil was 2, Alan was 3,

21:30.760 --> 21:32.920
~ Gordon was 4.
~ Gordon!

21:34.000 --> 21:37.630
In Canada, the temperature
was a bitter minus 10,

21:37.680 --> 21:40.220
so I urgently needed some warmth.

21:47.760 --> 21:51.360
What would have been wrong
with giving me a lighter?

21:52.040 --> 21:54.030
Can't get my fire lit.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.270
Cold beans.

21:56.320 --> 21:58.920
They're a bit frozen in the middle.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.070
'Having finished our lunch...'

22:06.120 --> 22:08.390
I'm not sure about the red, you know.

22:08.440 --> 22:11.640
'.. we went to book some
flights to Vancouver.'

22:12.600 --> 22:16.070
~ OK, you've actually just missed
the last flight out today.
~ Have we?

22:16.120 --> 22:18.990
~ Yeah.
~ Oh, what a rotten bit of luck.
Shall we go and get another drink?

22:19.040 --> 22:22.390
There's a Delta One that leaves
at ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

22:22.440 --> 22:25.110
Don't like Delta's seat upholstery.

22:25.160 --> 22:27.390
Would you go from Manchester?

22:27.440 --> 22:30.710
Manchester, no, you know, this
is the BBC, it think it would be

22:30.760 --> 22:33.990
idiotic to go to Manchester, I
mean, that would be just stupid.

22:34.040 --> 22:36.390
There's Lufthansa.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.150
Stewardesses wear trousers.

22:38.200 --> 22:41.310
~ There's one from Gatwick
which goes via Calgary if...
~ Gatwick?

22:41.360 --> 22:44.230
~ He doesn't like Gatwick.
~ I hate Gatwick.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.200
Out there somewhere...

22:55.160 --> 22:57.430
.. there are...

22:57.480 --> 22:58.750
bears.

23:00.000 --> 23:02.880
As many as 180,000 black bears.

23:04.120 --> 23:07.820
I can't remember what it
was, about 15,000 grizzlies.

23:13.440 --> 23:14.840
Freezing.

23:19.400 --> 23:23.630
In the morning I was cold and
exhausted from lack of sleep,

23:23.680 --> 23:26.320
but most of all, I was anxious.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.230
Any minute now.

23:33.360 --> 23:34.900
Any minute.

23:37.040 --> 23:39.380
I mean, they've had 24 hours.

23:40.240 --> 23:43.520
I mean... 24 hours.

23:44.880 --> 23:48.600
You can get anywhere in the
world in 24 hours, surely.

23:53.320 --> 23:55.800
Where the hell are they?

24:05.040 --> 24:07.310
~ I can't remember...
~ James.

24:08.600 --> 24:11.510
~ It's stopped beeping.
~ Well, yeah, it would.

24:11.560 --> 24:14.550
~ Why would it?
~ Cos the watch thing only
transmits the distress signal

24:14.600 --> 24:18.870
for 24 hours, then
the battery runs out.

24:18.920 --> 24:20.990
~ Seriously?
~ Well, yeah, it's only...

24:21.040 --> 24:22.750
Well, did you make a
note of where he was?

24:22.800 --> 24:25.740
Well, no, I didn't.
You've got the thing.

24:26.560 --> 24:30.270
Well, I... I remember he
was on something called...

24:30.320 --> 24:34.350
I think it was Wolf Mountain,
and you go up Bear Pass.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.830
Sounds grizzly.

24:35.880 --> 24:38.670
That was a good joke.

24:38.720 --> 24:41.870
No, actually, do you know the
biggest problem is not bears

24:41.920 --> 24:43.510
and wolves...

24:43.560 --> 24:45.430
cougars. Loads of cougars.

24:45.480 --> 24:48.270
~ Well, that's all right, then.
~ No, not that sort of cougar.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.510
Actually, a "Grrrr!"
That sort of cougar.

24:50.560 --> 24:53.200
Oh, you mean like a big cat thing?

24:55.120 --> 24:59.030
As I couldn't move from the spot
where the watch had transmitted

24:59.080 --> 25:00.470
the distress signal,

25:00.520 --> 25:04.600
I was hard at work trying to make
my life here more comfortable.

25:11.320 --> 25:13.110
I want somewhere to sit.

25:13.160 --> 25:16.660
I can't sit on the snow
so I'm building a shelter.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.470
Spark, you bastard.

25:28.440 --> 25:31.640
There we go, we have fire.

25:32.960 --> 25:37.640
'And with my supplies dwindling,
I also needed to think about food.'

25:39.400 --> 25:41.200
"Animals for food.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.870
"Guinea pigs.

25:44.920 --> 25:47.310
"All animals can be a
source of nourishment.

25:47.360 --> 25:51.560
"A few, including worms and insects,
can be collected with little skill."

26:02.080 --> 26:06.950
I'm bored, I'm cold, I'm unhappy,
I'm hungry, I'm scared.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.150
Ahh! Ahh!

26:09.200 --> 26:11.430
And I don't want to be wearing a hat!

26:11.480 --> 26:13.480
Just for a minute. Oh.

26:15.520 --> 26:19.030
'To alleviate the boredom,
and stave off the cold,

26:19.080 --> 26:22.720
'I tried to make some
SAS-style pine needle tea.'

26:25.360 --> 26:26.500
Ah!

26:27.520 --> 26:30.070
Ow! Ow!

26:30.120 --> 26:33.880
Ow! Where are they, just where?!

26:40.040 --> 26:44.750
'Unfortunately, we were a little
bit delayed at Vancouver Airport...'

26:44.800 --> 26:46.470
Yes, of course.

26:46.840 --> 26:49.510
'But eventually we made
it to the car park,

26:49.560 --> 26:53.120
'where our pick-up truck rescue
vehicles were waiting.'

27:12.240 --> 27:13.710
~ James.
~ Yeah.

27:13.760 --> 27:16.550
That's not a light - that's
a collapsed sun, isn't it?

27:16.600 --> 27:18.350
Yeah, never mind that, look.

27:18.400 --> 27:21.510
Mine is actually... comes
up to my nipples.

27:21.560 --> 27:25.030
I didn't realise it was... And do
you know what the other thing is?

27:25.080 --> 27:28.030
If I actually find Richard Hammond,
I'm not going to see him, am I?

27:28.080 --> 27:29.510
I'll just run straight over him.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.870
Have you noticed something
else about mine?

27:31.920 --> 27:35.350
This entire vehicle is
a transportation device

27:35.400 --> 27:37.310
for its own spare wheel, look.

27:37.360 --> 27:40.270
~ That's all the back's for!
~ That's really stupid.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.470
~ It's preposter...
~ Look at the size of it.
~ Look at it!

27:42.520 --> 27:44.950
Anyway, listen, we've got
everything we need here.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.550
I've got a big warm coat,
I've got a massive car,

27:47.600 --> 27:49.630
a rough idea of where
Richard Hammond is.

27:49.680 --> 27:51.470
Yeah, so let's go...

27:51.520 --> 27:54.870
into Vancouver, get a hotel,
good night's rest,

27:54.920 --> 27:56.990
get rid of this jet lag.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.470
It's not funny. I don't know what...

28:05.520 --> 28:08.060
They've got to get here tomorrow.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.600
Morning. Early.

28:25.080 --> 28:27.550
Um...

28:27.600 --> 28:29.990
Hold on.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.590
Hold on a minute.

28:31.640 --> 28:34.110
Can I just make something clear?

28:34.840 --> 28:38.470
That's the first time I've seen
this film and, um, I'm sorry,

28:38.520 --> 28:40.470
you two went into Vancouver.

28:40.520 --> 28:42.790
~ Well, yes.
~ To get rid of your jet lag.
~ Yes.

28:42.840 --> 28:44.350
No, tiredness kills, Hammond.

28:44.400 --> 28:46.990
~ Haven't you seen those
signs on the motorway?
~ Exactly.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.870
What annoys me as well here is
that you chose to do it in big

28:49.920 --> 28:52.390
~ American pick-up trucks.
~ Well, that's a good idea,

28:52.440 --> 28:55.510
because we hardly ever do big American
pick-up trucks on Top Gear.

28:55.560 --> 28:57.510
I know, I'm always
campaigning to do them.

28:57.560 --> 28:58.950
I know, and in part two of the film,

28:59.000 --> 29:02.430
we do them extensively on many
different types of terrain.

29:02.480 --> 29:04.630
Yes! Without me!

29:04.680 --> 29:07.270
Oh, this is unbelievable! I've
never heard such ingratitude.

29:07.320 --> 29:11.430
5,400 miles we travelled
to come and rescue you.

29:11.480 --> 29:14.710
~ In slow motion.
~ Yeah, but we thought you liked tenting!

29:14.760 --> 29:17.510
I do, in the Lake District
where there's a bit of drizzle

29:17.560 --> 29:19.030
and you can go out for some cake,

29:19.080 --> 29:23.270
not on top of a mountain at minus
ten, surrounded by bears!

29:23.320 --> 29:26.390
Well, we'll find out later on
if Richard Hammond manages to be

29:26.440 --> 29:28.310
grateful about any of this but, er,

29:28.360 --> 29:31.390
now it's time to put a star
in our reasonably priced car.

29:31.440 --> 29:32.630
Now, funnily enough,

29:32.680 --> 29:35.470
my guest tonight spent quite
a lot of time in Canada as well.

29:35.520 --> 29:37.430
Is she an ungrateful,
angry little man?

29:37.480 --> 29:41.070
No, no, she isn't, actually. She
is the star of both The X-Files

29:41.120 --> 29:45.230
and The Fall - ladies and gentlemen,
it is Gillian Anderson!

29:51.120 --> 29:53.640
~ I'll kiss you.
~ I hope so.

29:57.520 --> 30:00.390
Excellent. Thank you
so much for coming!

30:01.880 --> 30:04.070
So you can remember my
name throughout the show?

30:04.120 --> 30:06.750
No, it goes on there.
Eventually it goes on there.

30:06.800 --> 30:09.270
But I did have to look
whether it was a J or a G.

30:09.320 --> 30:12.390
Now, one of the things that
amazes me is you today joined

30:12.440 --> 30:16.430
a very small band of people
who have been on this show.

30:16.480 --> 30:19.430
~ Including...
~ By doing the worst time ever...

30:19.480 --> 30:22.000
~ We'll get to that later.
~ OK!

30:23.960 --> 30:26.300
How did you know? No, no, no!

30:26.760 --> 30:30.670
~ Benedict Cumberbatch, Simon
Cowell, Michael Gambon and you.
~ What?

30:30.720 --> 30:34.070
All... Everyone's offered a car
and driver to come down here

30:34.120 --> 30:36.230
~ but you said no, no, I'll drive myself.
~ Yeah.

30:36.280 --> 30:38.790
~ And you did drive yourself.
~ I did drive myself.
~ Very rare.

30:38.840 --> 30:41.590
Have you got a problem with drivers
or you just like driving...?

30:41.640 --> 30:43.950
~ I just like being in control, I think.
~ Really?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.230
Ultimately, no, I do like
dri... I drive everywhere,

30:46.280 --> 30:48.630
~ I drive everywhere.
~ You grew up in England, didn't you?

30:48.680 --> 30:50.790
A lot of people have been
very surprised to hear you

30:50.840 --> 30:52.790
~ talking with an English accent.
~ Yeah.

30:52.840 --> 30:55.670
~ But you actually did grow
up, grew up... Was it London?
~ London.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.550
~ You grew up in...
~ Crouch End and Haringey.

30:57.600 --> 31:01.110
~ But then you learned to drive in America.
~ At 16.

31:01.160 --> 31:04.710
At 16. And it was a Volkswagen
family that you'd come from?

31:04.760 --> 31:07.830
Well, when we were living
in London we had a Beetle,

31:07.880 --> 31:12.350
an old original body Beetle, the
skinny ones with the pointy tops.

31:12.400 --> 31:14.670
And then when we moved
to Grand Rapids, Michigan,

31:14.720 --> 31:17.310
we got what's called a Rabbit
which I think a Golf...

31:17.360 --> 31:19.910
A Volkswagen Golf is a Rabbit.

31:19.960 --> 31:22.670
~ An actual rabbit.
~ Yeah, yeah, but I think
they're the same thing.

31:22.720 --> 31:24.470
No, a rabbit's... not a car.

31:24.520 --> 31:27.830
That's what I, that's what I,
that's what I... It does exist.

31:27.880 --> 31:31.550
Yes, it does. So anyway,
so you learn to drive at 16.

31:31.600 --> 31:33.430
~ Yes.
~ In the States. And it went well?

31:33.480 --> 31:35.390
Yeah, yes, no, no, it went very well

31:35.440 --> 31:38.110
and then you were kind of
on probation for a period

31:38.160 --> 31:40.790
of time when you get your driver's
licence, where you can drive

31:40.840 --> 31:43.630
but you have to have somebody who
has a driving licence in the car.

31:43.680 --> 31:46.950
~ OK.
~ And, um, and I didn't on
the first time I went out

31:47.000 --> 31:49.750
and got into two car accidents
on the same day.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.470
I was literally, I swear to God,

31:52.520 --> 31:56.550
going to my very first acting
class, and I got rear-ended,

31:56.600 --> 31:58.390
and I thought it was my fault.

31:58.440 --> 32:01.070
And so I said, "I'm so
sorry, just go, go away."

32:01.120 --> 32:02.830
And I didn't get any information,

32:02.880 --> 32:05.430
and then had to pretend later
that I got hit in a parking lot.

32:05.480 --> 32:08.150
They must have thought all their
Christmases had come at once,

32:08.200 --> 32:10.990
somebody apologised for being
stationary when they ran into them.

32:11.040 --> 32:12.510
So what was the second one?

32:12.560 --> 32:14.910
I was trying to parallel
park and swung out and

32:14.960 --> 32:19.350
side-swiped a woman in
a large, uh, old Cadillac

32:19.400 --> 32:22.390
and she, she was very large
and her son was very large

32:22.440 --> 32:25.910
and they had a very
large baseball bat!

32:25.960 --> 32:28.630
And they were determined that
they were going to get money,

32:28.680 --> 32:30.270
so they followed me home.

32:30.320 --> 32:32.630
~ With a baseball bat.
~ With a baseball bat.

32:32.680 --> 32:35.510
And I walked up to the front
door, my mum answered

32:35.560 --> 32:39.110
and there were these two people, um,
wanting money, standing behind me.

32:39.160 --> 32:42.310
And she had the sense of
mind to look in her wallet

32:42.360 --> 32:45.510
and pretend that she only had 20,
and so she gave it to them and...

32:45.560 --> 32:48.070
~ And they were happy?
~ And sent them on their way, yeah.

32:48.120 --> 32:50.670
So, anyway, you grew up in
the UK, ended up in America,

32:50.720 --> 32:53.550
ended up acting, obviously, so
presumably you end up in Los Angeles

32:53.600 --> 32:58.030
~ at some point.
~ Yes.
~ What car did you have once
The X-Files had taken off?

32:58.080 --> 33:01.630
Well, while I was, I don't know
why, but when we were shooting

33:01.680 --> 33:07.110
in Vancouver, I had a Boxster,
um, and then while we were in LA,

33:07.160 --> 33:12.190
I did a commercial and they paid me
in a car and I got to choose a car.

33:12.240 --> 33:15.030
So I chose an old body 911.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.310
~ 911?
~ Yeah.
~ I'd have gone for a Veyron.

33:18.360 --> 33:22.750
Well, I'm sure that the budget,
uh, restricted me to a degree.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.790
~ Oh, I see, it wasn't like ANY car.
~ It wasn't ANY car, but, yeah.

33:25.840 --> 33:28.470
~ So you're a fan of the 911 Porsches?
~ Yes, very much, yeah.

33:28.520 --> 33:30.470
What is it that you like about 911s?

33:30.520 --> 33:33.510
Um, I liked about
that particular car,

33:33.560 --> 33:36.150
I liked how much you could
feel the road in it.

33:36.200 --> 33:38.790
It felt, you know,
it's a very basic car.

33:38.840 --> 33:41.790
I always think they're popular
in America cos 911's what you dial

33:41.840 --> 33:43.150
~ if you crash.
~ Yeah.

33:43.200 --> 33:45.710
So what do I... Oh, I
know, there's a number.

33:45.760 --> 33:48.710
~ Cos it's the same thing.
~ That's not bad. That's not a bad accent.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.590
I'm better in the south...
but that's about it.

33:51.640 --> 33:54.550
So have you got lots of speeding
tickets or are you...?

33:54.600 --> 33:56.710
~ I've had a few.
~ You have?

33:56.760 --> 33:59.630
The nicest, um, the nicest
thing that ever happened

33:59.680 --> 34:02.870
was in Canada on Christmas
Eve in Vancouver.

34:02.920 --> 34:07.070
I was properly speeding and a
policeman pulled up beside me,

34:07.120 --> 34:10.550
drove in front of me and
slowed me down and then

34:10.600 --> 34:13.310
he put his hand out the window
and gave me the thumbs up.

34:13.360 --> 34:15.190
And that was it. What's
properly speeding?

34:15.239 --> 34:17.710
~ Probably about 110.
~ Miles an hour?

34:17.760 --> 34:20.830
Yeah. How many tickets have you
got? Do you get a lot of tickets?

34:20.880 --> 34:23.909
~ I've just got my first in 35 years.
~ No!
~ Yeah.

34:27.000 --> 34:29.830
You know when you've got
an innocent face like mine,

34:29.880 --> 34:32.750
you don't like to cause offence,
which I don't, then you get...

34:32.800 --> 34:35.199
~ I smell bull
~ BLEEP.
~ It was...

34:36.600 --> 34:39.030
The other one you had in Los Angeles,

34:39.080 --> 34:43.469
~ didn't you have a Land Rover?
~ I had a Defe... Yes, I did.

34:43.520 --> 34:48.870
I, um, I fell in love with the
idea of having an old-fashioned

34:48.920 --> 34:53.110
Defender, a red one with a cream top
and it was as much the look of it

34:53.159 --> 34:56.230
~ as anything else and they're a
~ BLEEP
~ pain in the arse to drive.

34:56.280 --> 34:58.270
They are.

34:58.320 --> 35:01.390
The wheels are this big and they
turn, you have to turn the whole...

35:01.440 --> 35:05.750
~ And there's no shoulder room at all.
~ No, I bought it for about 12,000,

35:05.800 --> 35:09.190
I put about 35,000 into it,

35:09.240 --> 35:14.830
and I sold it on a celebrity
auction for 12,000.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.470
Cos it's only recently they've
started making cars...

35:17.520 --> 35:19.070
"Oh, right,

35:19.120 --> 35:21.510
"you want them to last and work?
We never thought of that!"

35:21.560 --> 35:24.550
~ They are quite reliable now.
~ You and your accents, very impressive.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.400
~ Well, you know...
~ Was that Australian?

35:30.920 --> 35:35.270
Anyway, it's time now to
talk about your lap. Cos...

35:35.320 --> 35:39.670
~ My 2,765 laps.
~ Well, it was a bit like that.

35:39.720 --> 35:43.470
You have set a record.
Most amount of laps done.

35:43.520 --> 35:47.310
Cos most people come down and
do seven or eight. You...

35:47.360 --> 35:51.080
~ What? Really?
~ Yeah. You did 22.
~ Oh!

35:52.680 --> 35:56.110
~ I'm going to be brutally honest with you.
~ No. I... No, what?

35:56.160 --> 36:01.510
Well, your first five were
all over two minutes.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.670
~ Right.
~ Which is, um...

36:03.720 --> 36:06.060
~ Yeah, off the...
~ Well, crap.

36:07.400 --> 36:09.190
It sucked at the beginning.

36:09.240 --> 36:11.550
It was wet and I couldn't even
I couldn't see the lines

36:11.600 --> 36:14.110
and I got three hours of sleep
last night, that doesn't help.

36:14.160 --> 36:17.950
~ Um...
~ Right, wet, couldn't see the lines.
~ Three hours' sleep, yeah.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.750
~ Body working OK? Oh, stick shift on...
~ Oh, no, frozen shoulder.

36:20.800 --> 36:23.750
~ OK, so that's good one, two, three...
~ But that... They're not,

36:23.800 --> 36:25.470
yeah, excuses!

36:26.720 --> 36:28.590
~ So.
~ Yeah, yeah.

36:28.640 --> 36:30.990
Would you like to see your lap?

36:31.040 --> 36:33.230
~ Yes.
~ Would everyone else like to?

36:33.280 --> 36:36.670
~ Yes!
~ Here we go, let's have a look.

36:37.920 --> 36:41.880
Whoa, that's a lot of power
on the... on the start there.

36:44.560 --> 36:46.560
That's a dirty look.

36:48.720 --> 36:51.720
Keeping it tight, very
tight through there.

36:53.680 --> 36:56.510
Tyres being tortured.

36:56.560 --> 36:59.760
~ Here we go.
~ This is good, this is really good.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.990
And yeah, it is wet through there.

37:04.040 --> 37:05.580
Well, moist.

37:08.280 --> 37:11.150
~ My foot's on the floor.
~ Is it?

37:11.200 --> 37:13.430
Right, now the Hammerhead.

37:13.480 --> 37:16.270
Are we going to be too
brutal through here?

37:16.320 --> 37:20.110
We are a bit, little
bit too much gas.

37:20.160 --> 37:21.510
But held it all together nicely.

37:21.560 --> 37:23.910
Keeping it in the middle
of the road on the way out

37:23.960 --> 37:25.470
and, oh, that was a gear change.

37:25.520 --> 37:29.110
I thought I turned
on climate control.

37:29.160 --> 37:32.030
Don't get distracted with
the Follow Through looming.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.750
Yes, nicely, that's very nicely done.

37:35.360 --> 37:37.190
And, oh, very quiet and smooth.

37:37.240 --> 37:39.710
Here we go, only two corners to go.

37:39.760 --> 37:44.760
Oh, that was a sudden gear change
there and only Gambon left.

37:46.000 --> 37:49.000
Very nice through there
and across the line.

37:52.920 --> 37:54.390
So, ha-ha!

37:57.240 --> 38:00.190
Bearing in mind, as
we've established,

38:00.240 --> 38:05.670
that your first five laps
of your 22 were about here.

38:05.720 --> 38:11.150
~ Yeah.
~ Two minutes. Where do you
think you came in the end?

38:11.200 --> 38:14.230
I think I'm probably
still below Jack.

38:14.280 --> 38:17.550
~ What, slower than 1.54.5?
~ I don't know what that means.

38:17.600 --> 38:21.110
~ One minute...
~ I know what that means.

38:21.160 --> 38:24.030
~ It's a unit of time.
~ I know.

38:24.080 --> 38:27.550
Well... one.

38:27.600 --> 38:29.710
~ Yeah.
~ So you improved.

38:29.760 --> 38:31.080
Yes!

38:34.000 --> 38:35.150
40.

38:35.200 --> 38:36.510
Oh! Oh!

38:36.560 --> 38:38.160
Ooh!

38:44.160 --> 38:45.590
~ Eight.
~ No!

38:45.640 --> 38:46.950
Point five.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.670
~ Oh
~ BLEEP!

38:48.720 --> 38:51.880
And it was mildly moist.
Which is actually...

38:54.040 --> 38:57.430
Oh, wow, yes! I beat Charles Dance!

38:57.480 --> 39:00.670
You beat Charles Dance,
you beat Joss Stone,

39:00.720 --> 39:02.990
you beat Kiefer Sutherland.

39:04.560 --> 39:07.910
~ That's a reboot!
~ That is quite something.

39:07.960 --> 39:11.590
~ Wow.
~ Yeah, that's one of the fastest
wet times we've ever had.

39:11.640 --> 39:15.200
~ Or mildly moist. I think it is.
~ It was more than mildly moist.

39:16.600 --> 39:20.000
I'll be the judge of what's
moist and what's not.

39:22.040 --> 39:24.790
~ And that was mildly moist.
~ OK.

39:24.840 --> 39:31.150
I know what, you are easily not only
the fastest wet lap, but also...

39:31.200 --> 39:33.190
~ most improved.
~ Oh.

39:33.240 --> 39:35.710
So ladies and gentlemen,
Gillian Anderson!

39:35.760 --> 39:39.080
Brilliant, that's good.

39:43.480 --> 39:48.630
Now, tonight Jeremy and I are using
two huge American pick-up trucks

39:48.680 --> 39:51.630
to rescue Richard Hammond,
who's been abandoned

39:51.680 --> 39:55.270
on a freezing cold mountain
top in the Canadian Rockies.

39:55.320 --> 39:58.070
We pick up the action after
we'd had a good night's rest

39:58.120 --> 40:00.760
in a downtown Vancouver hotel.

40:12.520 --> 40:18.070
We set off before dawn, not knowing
exactly where Hammond was.

40:18.120 --> 40:21.990
But we did know he was
at least 400 miles away.

40:22.040 --> 40:25.740
So, we had plenty of time
to get to know our vehicles.

40:28.120 --> 40:32.150
I am driving a Ford
F-150 pick-up truck,

40:32.200 --> 40:37.710
which is, by miles, the
bestselling vehicle in America.

40:37.760 --> 40:42.830
Ford sells one of these
things every 35 seconds.

40:42.880 --> 40:46.160
And that's only in America,
remember - 35 seconds.

40:47.760 --> 40:51.310
If you were to park every
F-150 that's ever been made

40:51.360 --> 40:56.310
since 1948, side by side -
not end to end, side by side -

40:56.360 --> 41:00.070
the line would stretch
round the equator...

41:00.120 --> 41:01.390
twice!

41:03.560 --> 41:08.230
The reason it sells so well
is simple - it's cheap.

41:08.280 --> 41:11.310
You can have an F-150 with
an automatic gearbox,

41:11.360 --> 41:13.390
cruise control, air conditioning

41:13.440 --> 41:17.270
and a 350 horsepower V8 motor,

41:17.320 --> 41:19.910
for the equivalent of Â£20,000.

41:19.960 --> 41:23.960
Now that's what we pay in Europe
for a Vauxhall Astra diesel.

41:28.360 --> 41:33.590
By comparison, my pick-up
truck is a sales disaster.

41:33.640 --> 41:36.550
What I'm driving here,
viewers, the Silverado,

41:36.600 --> 41:40.910
the Chevrolet Silverado, is the
second bestselling pick-up truck.

41:40.960 --> 41:44.560
They only manage to shift
one of these every minute.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.920
I'm amazed Chevrolet
are still in business.

41:50.280 --> 41:55.720
Meanwhile, very far away, my third
day on the mountain was beginning.

41:57.080 --> 42:00.380
I didn't sleep last night.
I was cold all night.

42:00.720 --> 42:03.520
I'm going to have to
get more firewood.

42:04.320 --> 42:07.590
The thought of that,
swinging that axe again.

42:07.640 --> 42:09.270
It's probably a good diet, this.

42:09.320 --> 42:11.670
You'll see it on This
Morning at some point.

42:11.720 --> 42:13.630
Well, what you need

42:13.680 --> 42:15.670
is to be abandoned
by two good friends.

42:15.720 --> 42:18.920
Well, when I say good friends,
I mean bastards.

42:22.560 --> 42:25.670
Look, that's what I call a breakfast,

42:25.720 --> 42:28.960
~ thank you very, very much.
~ Ah, that's perfect.

42:32.880 --> 42:36.070
After our winter-warming breakfast,
we were back on the road

42:36.120 --> 42:40.350
and delving once more
into our pick-up trucks.

42:40.400 --> 42:46.150
I'm going to be honest with you
- this is no ordinary F-150.

42:46.200 --> 42:48.710
This is the
top-of-the-range Raptor model,

42:48.760 --> 42:52.270
which has been beefed up,
supercharged and intercooled

42:52.320 --> 42:54.870
and then renamed Velociraptor,

42:54.920 --> 42:58.910
by a company called Hennessey,
makers of the Venom,

42:58.960 --> 43:03.240
one of the fastest road cars
the world has ever seen.

43:06.640 --> 43:10.710
So the 6.2-litre V8 that
I have under the bonnet

43:10.760 --> 43:16.270
produces - ahem - 623 horsepower.

43:16.320 --> 43:19.550
That's 212 more than standard.

43:19.600 --> 43:23.870
And that makes it quick
- alarmingly quick.

43:27.080 --> 43:29.230
Listen to that!

43:29.280 --> 43:31.400
It's like a jet.

43:34.280 --> 43:37.070
While Jeremy was in a
supercharged rocket ship,

43:37.120 --> 43:41.950
I was riding a wave
of low-down grunt.

43:42.000 --> 43:49.790
I have at my disposal a 6.6-litre
turbo-charged V8 diesel engine.

43:49.840 --> 43:54.870
It develops 765 pound-feet of torque.

43:54.920 --> 43:58.630
That's more than one of those
Supersport Bentley Continentals.

43:58.680 --> 44:02.150
I also have the Z71 off-road pack,

44:02.200 --> 44:04.750
which means I get a lot of
under-body strengthening,

44:04.800 --> 44:07.350
beefed-up dampers and
it has as standard

44:07.400 --> 44:10.030
a sophisticated four-wheel
drive system.

44:10.080 --> 44:13.830
I think for International Rescue,
this is like Thunderbird 2.

44:13.880 --> 44:17.760
It's the one that does all the
really serious, proper work.

44:21.640 --> 44:25.110
With 52 hours gone and
International Rescue

44:25.160 --> 44:31.150
nowhere in sight, I was resorting
to extreme measures to find food.

44:31.200 --> 44:36.990
This is the snare. It just
tightens, like that.

44:37.040 --> 44:40.990
I lay this on the rabbit
trail, which is here.

44:41.040 --> 44:43.880
Foot, caught, rabbit - dinner.

44:45.240 --> 44:46.790
There.

44:46.840 --> 44:48.990
Apparently the way you bait it...

44:49.040 --> 44:50.580
is with pee.

44:59.440 --> 45:00.910
Another layer.

45:00.960 --> 45:03.230
Two...

45:04.680 --> 45:06.670
Four...

45:09.200 --> 45:11.340
What if a bear comes now?

45:14.160 --> 45:17.790
Meanwhile, James and I, keen
to be ready for any emergency,

45:17.840 --> 45:21.560
had decided to buy VITAL
rescue equipment.

45:22.640 --> 45:24.790
Why? What's... What's
that bit there for?

45:24.840 --> 45:26.350
It's a can opener, bottle opener.

45:26.400 --> 45:28.990
~ What a...
~ You need a bottle.
~ It's a bottle opener.

45:29.040 --> 45:32.070
It opens beer! Yes, we want them!

45:32.120 --> 45:34.510
Is that...? That's worth
having, isn't it?

45:34.560 --> 45:36.790
~ What is it?
~ Scrapy, scrapy, brushy, brushy.

45:36.840 --> 45:38.150
You don't need a brush.

45:38.200 --> 45:41.990
Well, OK, saw the brush off.
I can't buy just one end, can I?

45:42.040 --> 45:43.750
There you go, see,
there's just one end.

45:43.800 --> 45:47.200
~ But you might as well have a brush as well.
~ No, you don't need a brush.

45:50.360 --> 45:52.630
I haven't made these...

45:52.680 --> 45:55.270
exactly like the ones in the book

45:55.320 --> 45:59.670
cos I once saw Ray
Mears make snowshoes

45:59.720 --> 46:02.960
and they were more like this.

46:15.040 --> 46:16.590
Aaagh!

46:16.640 --> 46:18.390
Cold!

46:18.440 --> 46:20.080
REALLY COLD!

46:25.080 --> 46:28.030
That's it. That's where I peed.

46:28.080 --> 46:29.760
No rabbit.

46:36.400 --> 46:38.870
It's all rubbish! Nothing works!

46:41.280 --> 46:44.030
~ Where the
~ BLEEP
~ are they?

46:48.320 --> 46:50.430
âª More than a feeling

46:50.480 --> 46:54.430
~ âª More than a feeling
~ When I hear that old song... âª

46:54.480 --> 46:58.040
I have my seat heater
on, it's very nice.

46:59.400 --> 47:04.070
I really am starting to DEEPLY
like my Velociraptor.

47:04.120 --> 47:07.310
This reminds me, and you're going
to think I'm mad but it's true,

47:07.360 --> 47:12.870
it reminds me of a 1992
supercharged Aston Martin -

47:12.920 --> 47:14.830
they're very similar.

47:14.880 --> 47:17.310
I used to LOVE that car.

47:17.360 --> 47:19.470
This looks like rather
an attractive small town,

47:19.520 --> 47:23.040
I wouldn't mind stopping for
something like a cappuccino.

47:24.320 --> 47:28.870
By mid-afternoon, there was still
no sign of Yogi and Boo-Boo.

47:28.920 --> 47:32.080
So I prepared myself for
a third night in the open.

47:34.280 --> 47:37.070
And if you want to write to the BBC

47:37.120 --> 47:39.910
and say this is some
rare type of tree

47:39.960 --> 47:43.640
and has to be preserved, you
can stick it up your arse!

47:45.320 --> 47:48.150
I'm sick of the sight of this place.

47:48.200 --> 47:51.960
~ I'm a television presenter
from Birmingham, not Bear
~ BLEEP
~ Grylls!

47:54.600 --> 47:59.990
Despite our best efforts, James and
I were still more than 150 miles

48:00.040 --> 48:01.870
from our friend and colleague.

48:01.920 --> 48:05.230
Night was falling, the
roads were getting worse

48:05.280 --> 48:07.390
and there was another issue.

48:07.440 --> 48:11.470
Sit-rep - James May does
not like driving in the snow

48:11.520 --> 48:13.670
and has now REDUCED his speed...

48:13.720 --> 48:15.790
to about three.

48:15.840 --> 48:19.510
To annoy HIM, as much
as he was annoying ME,

48:19.560 --> 48:23.350
I decided to ignite my collapsed sun.

48:23.400 --> 48:24.670
Right.

48:26.520 --> 48:28.390
CLARKSON!

48:30.000 --> 48:34.510
I've never, ever encountered a light
like that on the front of a car.

48:34.560 --> 48:37.430
Seriously, very funny, but could
you turn the big light off?

48:37.480 --> 48:39.550
Only when you speed up.

48:41.280 --> 48:43.550
~ Turn the
~ BLEEP
~ light off!

48:44.880 --> 48:49.070
It was a long, horrible
drive but mercifully,

48:49.120 --> 48:51.510
when we were just ten
miles from Hammond,

48:51.560 --> 48:54.860
we found a lodge where
we could spend the night.

48:56.800 --> 49:00.000
And the next morning,
I came up with a plan.

49:01.640 --> 49:03.790
Hammond is ten miles away

49:03.840 --> 49:07.070
and 4,000ft above us. So...

49:07.120 --> 49:08.590
we have a race.

49:08.640 --> 49:12.600
And if you get there first,
you DON'T have to rescue him.

49:14.760 --> 49:18.550
~ Come on, that's an incentive.
~ No, you're right, it is, isn't it?

49:18.600 --> 49:21.030
So if you don't get there first,
you have to drive, what,

49:21.080 --> 49:22.350
15 hours back to Vancouver

49:22.400 --> 49:24.310
with Richard Hammond
in your pick-up truck.

49:24.360 --> 49:27.230
Can you imagine driving
15 hours back to Vancouver

49:27.280 --> 49:30.880
with him either dead or bad-tempered?

49:32.280 --> 49:34.790
~ Where the
~ BLEEP
~ are you?!

49:34.840 --> 49:39.670
I peed in a bottle in my tent
last night and it felt dirty!

49:39.720 --> 49:41.060
Enough!

49:43.400 --> 49:45.550
With a good breakfast
under our belts,

49:45.600 --> 49:48.710
James and I were planning our routes.

49:48.760 --> 49:52.470
So Hammond is around there, that's
where the signal came from -

49:52.520 --> 49:57.230
from his watch. So if I go
up what I think is Wolf Pass,

49:57.280 --> 50:00.390
the corpse of Richard Hammond
will be around here somewhere.

50:00.440 --> 50:03.430
It's slightly longer, but it's
only a little bit longer,

50:03.480 --> 50:08.110
but I'm avoiding that massive rise
there. I'm going to go that way.

50:08.160 --> 50:11.390
~ Are you ready, May?
~ I've never been more ready.

50:11.440 --> 50:14.950
Three, two, one... BEGIN!

50:21.240 --> 50:23.750
This is an interesting
race, it really is,

50:23.800 --> 50:26.950
because although our
pick-up trucks...

50:27.000 --> 50:29.070
appear to be the same,

50:29.120 --> 50:32.060
but actually they're
not the same at all.

50:32.960 --> 50:35.950
His is all about strength and torque

50:36.000 --> 50:38.800
and this is all about
speed and power.

50:39.720 --> 50:43.470
And then there's our driving
styles. James' is very...

50:43.520 --> 50:46.110
slow and methodical
and full of maths.

50:46.160 --> 50:48.160
Mine's more sort of...

50:50.400 --> 50:53.400
.. put your foot down
and hope for the best.

50:55.880 --> 50:58.390
Traction control is on.

50:58.440 --> 51:01.630
Thumbs outside the wheel -
that's the other off-road tip.

51:01.680 --> 51:04.030
Absolutely gorgeous scenery.

51:04.080 --> 51:07.270
Hammond will have been having
a lovely time looking at this.

51:07.320 --> 51:09.670
It's like being in a spa.

51:09.720 --> 51:10.990
BLEEP!

51:16.960 --> 51:19.320
YOU... are going on there!

51:27.280 --> 51:31.440
In the Ford, I'd decided to
use one of God's highways.

51:39.800 --> 51:41.540
Ha-ha-ha, ha-ha!

51:42.840 --> 51:46.230
Rivers, as we know, are level,
unless they're waterfalls.

51:46.280 --> 51:49.440
Just hope we don't
encounter one of those.

51:51.600 --> 51:53.310
There's my camera. Yeah,

51:53.360 --> 51:54.870
I can now see...

51:54.920 --> 51:56.590
what I'm doing.

51:59.840 --> 52:01.510
Two miles completed.

52:01.560 --> 52:04.070
No serious problems.

52:05.640 --> 52:07.110
Jeez!

52:08.640 --> 52:10.360
Yes, good work.

52:13.880 --> 52:16.820
I love my pick-up truck!
I really love it.

52:18.200 --> 52:20.590
Both of us were now
off the beaten track

52:20.640 --> 52:23.760
and full of steely determination.

52:30.200 --> 52:33.560
Come on, Jeremy, you
need to get there first.

52:35.160 --> 52:37.640
Thunderbird 1 is power-sliding.

52:38.720 --> 52:40.120
Ooh, yes!

52:42.440 --> 52:45.540
This is called "wrestling
with the controls".

52:47.360 --> 52:49.120
Whoa!

52:50.600 --> 52:51.960
Ohh!

52:53.280 --> 52:56.150
âª Silverado

52:56.200 --> 53:00.230
âª Why don't you come
to your senses? âª

53:00.280 --> 53:03.280
Temperatures and pressures
all in the green.

53:04.360 --> 53:08.830
This is shouting and power
versus thought and torque.

53:08.880 --> 53:11.270
Come on!

53:11.320 --> 53:13.790
I've got some rooster tails now.

53:15.240 --> 53:16.950
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

53:17.000 --> 53:21.080
Good news, Hammond, the Velociraptor
works well in these conditions.

53:22.280 --> 53:24.420
Where is he? Where is he?

53:29.840 --> 53:32.990
"Hello." "Hello. I'm James."

53:33.040 --> 53:35.550
"Oh, I'm Jeremy. Shall
we be friends, James?"

53:35.600 --> 53:37.550
"Yes, let's be best friends
for ever and ever."

53:37.600 --> 53:39.950
"Right, James, I must tell
you all about myself.

53:40.000 --> 53:43.110
"Actually, that's my favourite hobby,
telling people how WONDERFUL I am."

53:43.160 --> 53:44.630
"Oh, really, Jeremy? That's funny

53:44.680 --> 53:46.430
"because I AM brilliant
at everything."

53:46.480 --> 53:48.870
"Are you?" "Yes, I am, but
I'm very modest." "Are you?"

53:48.920 --> 53:51.270
"Yes, that's why I drive
a yellow Ferrari." "Do you?"

53:51.320 --> 53:53.510
"I drive everything better
than everybody else.

53:53.560 --> 53:54.710
"Let's have another friend

53:54.760 --> 53:57.070
"but let's leave him to die
on a mountain top, shall we?"

53:57.120 --> 53:59.470
"That'd be funny. Then we
could look really cool..."

53:59.520 --> 54:02.510
Knowing that Hammond
would be on high ground,

54:02.560 --> 54:04.590
I was now climbing...

54:04.640 --> 54:06.200
hard.

54:17.560 --> 54:21.240
God, I love this thing!
Really, properly do.

54:26.880 --> 54:31.430
All day yesterday, this was
an Aston Martin V8 Vantage.

54:31.480 --> 54:33.950
Now it's a Group B Audi Quattro.

54:40.000 --> 54:43.200
On my route, I too was climbing.

54:48.880 --> 54:51.640
Do your stuff, Z71 pack.

54:54.360 --> 54:56.030
You can actually feel
the wheels going,

54:56.080 --> 54:57.790
"Is it this one? Is it that one?

54:57.840 --> 55:01.080
"I'll put a bit of power there.
I'll put a bit to that one."

55:04.360 --> 55:07.110
But as we climbed past 4,000 feet,

55:07.160 --> 55:10.200
the going started
to get REALLY tough.

55:12.400 --> 55:15.600
Keep going, keep going,
keep going, keep going.

55:16.600 --> 55:18.800
Thunderbird 2 is still go.

55:22.320 --> 55:25.110
Keep those revs up, keep
the wheels spinning.

55:25.160 --> 55:28.310
Come on, Jeremy, you
need to get there first.

55:28.360 --> 55:31.270
I do NOT want to drive
back to Vancouver

55:31.320 --> 55:32.510
with my Velociraptor

55:32.560 --> 55:36.960
being SOILED by Hammond's
cheesy, decomposing bottom.

55:39.720 --> 55:41.630
"Oh, my head's come off." "Has it?"

55:41.680 --> 55:44.070
"Well, a man threw a knife at
me but I caught it in my teeth.

55:44.120 --> 55:46.510
"Literally, my head came
off." "Oh, but I'm OK."

55:46.560 --> 55:48.070
Oh, are you(?)

55:48.120 --> 55:50.510
In the cock! Ha!

55:50.560 --> 55:51.910
Right in the nads!

55:51.960 --> 55:54.550
Look at that! Jahhh!

55:54.600 --> 55:57.150
âª Driving along

55:57.200 --> 55:59.280
âª Singing this song... âª

56:00.920 --> 56:03.110
Come on.

56:03.160 --> 56:06.470
âª.. Something in a
winter wonderland. âª

56:06.520 --> 56:09.110
BLEEP!

56:09.160 --> 56:14.430
Situation update, viewers. Bit
too close to the edge there. Um...

56:14.480 --> 56:18.950
I've got to be careful how I move
otherwise I'll fall into the valley.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.400
Still, could be worse.

56:23.280 --> 56:25.560
Whoa! Oh, no!

56:27.160 --> 56:29.480
BLEEP! BLEEP!

56:30.880 --> 56:32.120
Whoa!

56:34.560 --> 56:38.710
Faced with the prospect of having to
rescue the world's angriest man...

56:38.760 --> 56:42.510
~ Where are you, you pair of
~ BLEEP
~ middle-aged
~ BLEEP!

56:42.560 --> 56:47.030
..James and I had BOTH decided
to rip out our own fingernails.

56:47.080 --> 56:48.390
Ow!

56:48.440 --> 56:49.760
Ow!

56:52.320 --> 56:54.720
This made progress MUCH easier.

56:55.840 --> 57:00.670
That feels good. Temperatures and
pressures still in the green.

57:00.720 --> 57:03.950
With snow chains fitted, you're
supposed to be gentle,

57:04.000 --> 57:08.190
but luckily my colleague doesn't
know what that means.

57:11.240 --> 57:13.110
Dig and claw, dig and claw.

57:13.160 --> 57:14.590
Come on! Digging.

57:14.640 --> 57:16.670
Damn and blast!

57:23.720 --> 57:25.470
Come on!

57:25.520 --> 57:27.430
COME ON!

57:27.480 --> 57:31.760
No, you want to do this, you DON'T
want Richard Hammond in you.

57:33.320 --> 57:35.320
Oh, no!

57:36.720 --> 57:38.920
The news was grim.

57:40.960 --> 57:42.520
BLEEP!

57:49.520 --> 57:53.630
You are genuinely a bit of
a desperado here, Silverado.

57:53.680 --> 57:55.220
Loving that.

57:56.040 --> 57:57.590
And loving that as well.

57:57.640 --> 58:00.670
I'm still coming, Richard Hammond.

58:00.720 --> 58:03.320
And you know what? So was I.

58:06.640 --> 58:09.590
We are under way. Three
wheels on my wagon

58:09.640 --> 58:11.910
and I AM still rolling along.

58:11.960 --> 58:13.760
Come on, machine.

58:15.120 --> 58:18.060
Where the hell is James
May? Where is May?

58:20.080 --> 58:21.750
Bit of beans there.

58:21.800 --> 58:24.670
Slightly less beans
there for the climb.

58:30.240 --> 58:33.920
That's an engine. It's not
a plane, it's a car. It's...

58:41.120 --> 58:43.120
That's got to be them!

58:44.120 --> 58:46.920
Where the bloody hell
have they been?!

58:47.440 --> 58:49.710
Come on. Do it.

58:49.760 --> 58:51.390
Claw.

58:51.440 --> 58:53.950
Stop panicking, just...

58:54.000 --> 58:56.230
ease it off.

58:56.280 --> 58:58.030
Really struggling.

58:58.080 --> 59:00.190
Really struggling here.

59:00.240 --> 59:01.580
Come on!

59:06.200 --> 59:09.550
It's Hammond! Hammond is THERE!

59:09.600 --> 59:12.350
How can it have taken that long?!

59:12.400 --> 59:18.150
May, bad news. You're going to have
to take Hammond BACK to Vancouver.

59:18.200 --> 59:21.590
That's a powerful vehicle,
that is a go-anywhere car.

59:21.640 --> 59:24.350
~ So where the
~ BLEEP
~ have you been?

59:24.400 --> 59:28.470
And he's in an appalling
temper, absolutely shocking.

59:28.520 --> 59:31.680
Where are you going? Well, now what?!

59:32.720 --> 59:35.120
Oh, that's your rescue, is it?!

59:43.760 --> 59:45.200
Hold on.

59:46.320 --> 59:48.870
THAT was shocking!

59:48.920 --> 59:51.830
I have seen Thunderbirds
and I never saw Alan

59:51.880 --> 59:54.870
flying along, listening to Boston,
eating a bar of chocolate.

59:54.920 --> 59:56.670
~ No, you say that...
~ Neither did I see

59:56.720 --> 59:58.950
Virgil suggesting they
stop for a cappuccino,

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.230
they were both focused
on the job in hand.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:06.550
Yes. But in that film, we did prove
that your watch system works

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:08.790
and both James and I

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:11.750
completely fell in love with
our pick-up trucks, didn't we?

01:00:11.800 --> 01:00:13.310
Yeah, no, this is a very good point.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:15.110
Because, let's be
honest, for 12 years

01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:17.710
we've looked down our noses at
big, American pick-up trucks.

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:20.150
But having spent quite
a few days in them,

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.870
we ended up completely besotted.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.190
It's the value that staggers me.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:28.630
Because American pick-up trucks are
exempt from the gas guzzler tax,

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.630
they are SPECTACULARLY cheap.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.190
Yeah. I'm surprised actually

01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.550
there aren't more people
importing them over here.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.830
Yeah, well, I think the problem
is a car, vehicle I should say,

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:40.390
this size wouldn't really
work in Britain.

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.950
And there's another problem.
Excuse me, Hammond.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.030
I think if you put
something in the back,

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.830
every time you pull up
at a set of red lights

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.350
someone is going to nick it.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.350
Yeah, you're dead right.
You're dead right.

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:54.150
But even so, I maintain my
Silverado, it was brilliant.

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.030
Well, it was, James,
but let's be honest,

01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.750
it didn't actually reach the
top of the mountain, did it?

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.350
No, I wasn't going to mention that.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.790
Actually, just before the end
it did break a driveshaft.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.030
Yeah, I did wonder if you
were going to mention that,

01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.350
because it wasn't IN the film

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:09.750
In the end, neither Thunderbird
Fat nor Thunderbird Slow

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:12.750
~ actually rescued me.
~ That is true.

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.070
No, an actual rescue person
had to come and save me.

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:19.470
And can I just talk about the four
days - FOUR DAYS - of misery

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.230
I endured whilst you two
dawdled from breakfast

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.230
to breakfast in your heated trucks.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.630
No, I'm sorry, there isn't time.

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.110
And on that bombshell
we really must end.

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.750
Thank you so much for
watching. Good night!
