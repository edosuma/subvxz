00:02.367 --> 00:02.667
- Previously on

00:04.100 --> 00:05.266
"The Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills"...

00:05.300 --> 00:07.400
- I let go of my marriage.
I let of everything.

00:07.433 --> 00:09.600
I did not see
it ending this way.

00:09.633 --> 00:13.033
I was gonna hold
that man's hand till he died.

00:13.066 --> 00:14.166
- When you were married,

00:14.200 --> 00:16.367
it was probably
more of what he wanted.

00:16.400 --> 00:18.266
- That would be all of
what he wanted.

00:18.300 --> 00:20.066
- And now you get to do
what you want.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.400
- Right.

00:21.433 --> 00:23.100
- You need to start thinking
about a bat mitzvah dress.

00:23.133 --> 00:24.300
- Mom, no.

00:24.333 --> 00:26.066
- You should be excited
about that, Portia.

00:26.100 --> 00:28.266
- I don't even know
what to wear to a bat mitzvah.

00:28.300 --> 00:31.133
- Portia's not socializing,
so it worries me,

00:31.166 --> 00:32.300
as a mom, for her.

00:34.266 --> 00:39.233
- It looks so cute, Harry.
It's Positano in Beverly Hills.

00:39.266 --> 00:42.133
- Everything's kind of ready.

00:42.166 --> 00:44.133
- Wow.
- Che bello.

00:44.166 --> 00:46.233
- This is really good.
Wow.

00:46.266 --> 00:50.333
- The word "violate"
is really crazy to me.

00:50.367 --> 00:52.100
- Look up the word.

00:52.133 --> 00:54.633
It is an abuse of privacy,
which is what you did to me.

00:54.667 --> 00:56.367
- Why are you so defensive?

00:56.400 --> 00:59.400
- You're upset
because you're jealous.

00:59.433 --> 01:02.633
- Uh-uh. I'm out. I'm out.
you, Crystal.

01:02.667 --> 01:06.100
- What am I gonna say?
- Jealous of what?

01:06.133 --> 01:08.400
Your ugly leather pants?

01:10.667 --> 01:12.300
- Oh my God. Oh my God.
Oh my God.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.100
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
Nope. Nope, nope, nope.

01:14.133 --> 01:16.100
- She said "ugly leather pants.
Ugly leather pants."

01:16.133 --> 01:19.667
- What am I jealous of?
Are you ----ing kidding me? No.

01:19.700 --> 01:22.266
- Wait, wait, wait.
Sutton, come here for a second.

01:22.300 --> 01:23.433
- Hold on. Hold on.
Don't leave.

01:23.467 --> 01:25.133
- Listen to me.
- Please, sit down.

01:25.166 --> 01:26.266
- Listen to me.
- I don't--

01:26.300 --> 01:27.667
- Listen to me.

01:27.700 --> 01:29.033
- Sutton, what happened?
- Yes, I'm listening.

01:29.066 --> 01:31.400
- Listen to me. Listen to me.
-

01:31.433 --> 01:33.200
- Calm down, okay?

01:33.233 --> 01:35.166
You're okay. And it's okay.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.367
- Breathe.
- It's all right.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.166
- Breathe. Breathe.
- It's all right.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.500
- Breathe.
- Get you a drink?

01:39.533 --> 01:43.133
- I'm good. I think maybe
someone else needs a drink.

01:43.166 --> 01:44.400
- It's all right, okay?
- Okay.

01:44.433 --> 01:46.233
- It's all right.
- Okay.

01:46.266 --> 01:48.133
I didn't handle that well.

01:48.166 --> 01:49.300
- It doesn't matter.
- It's okay.

01:49.333 --> 01:51.266
- Sweetie, what happened?
- That's okay.

01:51.300 --> 01:54.400
- You know,
that was wrong of me.

01:54.433 --> 01:58.367
I think they were pleather.
Not leather pants, but.

02:00.367 --> 02:02.200
- Garcelle, tell me what--

02:03.467 --> 02:05.700
- I'm a little shocked.
I don't--

02:05.734 --> 02:07.467
- You were coming down
looking beautiful and smiling.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.467
- I was like--
- And then it all blew up.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.133
- Do you want me
to walk you out?

02:11.166 --> 02:12.200
- No, no, no, I'm okay.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.467
- Okay.
- Tell me what to do.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.266
- I am always gonna be
100% honest with you.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.567
- Yeah.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.300
- The word "violation"
threw everybody for a loop.

02:20.333 --> 02:22.100
- That's the word I used.

02:22.133 --> 02:23.367
And if people don't like it,
they don't like it.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.467
I'm not gonna take back
a word that I used,

02:25.500 --> 02:28.367
actually, correctly,
and it means...

02:28.400 --> 02:30.100
- Crossing the line.
- A violation of privacy.

02:30.133 --> 02:31.400
Crossing the line.
She crossed the line.

02:31.433 --> 02:34.700
- Girl, come on.
You got to bend a little bit.

02:34.734 --> 02:36.700
"You know, hey,
maybe I went out of line,

02:36.734 --> 02:38.700
but I also felt like you
did something."

02:38.734 --> 02:40.333
At least acknowledge that.

02:40.367 --> 02:42.266
It doesn't mean
you're not right.

02:42.300 --> 02:44.233
- Can we just go sit down...
- Well, it's your home.

02:44.266 --> 02:46.500
- And have a cocktail,
and we can talk a little bit

02:46.533 --> 02:48.500
if we're uncomfortable?
Thank you.

02:48.533 --> 02:52.200
- What does it take to get
a drink around this place?

02:52.233 --> 02:53.333
- What can I say?

02:53.367 --> 02:55.300
- You and your ugly
leather pants.

02:55.333 --> 02:56.500
- I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to say.

02:56.533 --> 02:57.734
- Nothing.
- What did she say?

02:57.767 --> 02:59.200
- But you can't egg her on.
- What'd she say?

02:59.233 --> 03:01.200
- Lisa wants everybody
just to sit down.

03:01.233 --> 03:02.533
- Let's go.
- Okay, I will, I will.

03:02.567 --> 03:04.200
But, like, tell me--
- Let's go.

03:04.233 --> 03:05.734
You guys do that.
- No, no, baby, you're fine.

03:05.767 --> 03:07.734
- Ooh, are those hot toddies?

03:07.767 --> 03:09.567
- So whatever
you wanna do, honey.

03:09.600 --> 03:11.467
I do not want you
to feel pressure.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.300
If you feel
comfortable enough--

03:13.333 --> 03:15.300
- Come sit next to me.

03:15.333 --> 03:17.734
- Okay, I'm coming.

03:17.767 --> 03:21.500
Crystal, I apologize for
talking badly about your pants.

03:21.533 --> 03:23.567
I think they're very cute,
actually.

03:23.600 --> 03:26.200
- Fashion--it's not
that important.

03:26.233 --> 03:28.233
- No, I don't care about it.

03:28.266 --> 03:31.767
- When you insult someone's
outfit, that is below the belt.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.767
- Not everyone likes
what everyone wears.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.266
Sutton's wore
some questionable sh--.

03:37.300 --> 03:38.767
- I think the pants
are darling.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.533
- I never had this.

03:40.567 --> 03:43.233
- It's, like, a whiskey,
and it's really--

03:43.266 --> 03:45.433
- But we all thought this was
done and finished

03:45.467 --> 03:47.533
and we weren't gonna
talk about it again.

03:47.567 --> 03:51.266
But Sutton was in tears
and wanted to leave.

03:51.300 --> 03:52.433
She still feels uncomfortable.

03:52.467 --> 03:54.300
- Did something I say
trigger it today?

03:54.333 --> 03:55.467
- No, it's just your presence.

03:55.500 --> 03:56.567
- My presence. Okay.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.533
- Now, was that necessary?

03:58.567 --> 04:01.000
- No-no--do you--y'all,
come on.

04:01.033 --> 04:06.166
It's hard for me to, like,
be here and be with you,

04:06.200 --> 04:09.567
'cause you made judgments
about me without knowing me.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.300
- You know that line?

04:11.333 --> 04:12.433
"When people show you
who they are, believe them"?

04:12.467 --> 04:13.567
That's all.

04:13.600 --> 04:16.000
- Why are you constantly mean?

04:18.467 --> 04:20.533
- You're upset because
you want be to apologize

04:20.567 --> 04:24.000
for something that you did.
I will not.

04:24.033 --> 04:25.300
Let's be clear.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.300
- No. Let's--
- I will not apologize...

04:27.333 --> 04:28.567
- Get your fingers...
- For your actions.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.300
- Out of the air.

04:30.333 --> 04:32.300
- You're an inappropriate,
awkward person.

04:36.433 --> 04:38.500
Period.

04:38.533 --> 04:40.266
And then you want to cry
and get empathy?

04:40.300 --> 04:42.433
You're not gonna get it.
Trust me.

04:42.467 --> 04:45.567
- Okay. One, I'm not crying
to get empathy.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.433
I was crying
because I wanted to leave.

04:47.467 --> 04:50.367
- Then leave!

04:50.400 --> 04:52.667
It's obnoxious.
- Mm.

04:52.700 --> 04:56.266
- I think we should put
on your big girl panties.

04:56.300 --> 04:58.300
Tell her what you need.

04:58.333 --> 05:02.033
- What do you want from her
so we can move on?

05:05.500 --> 05:08.633
- You have hurt me.

05:08.667 --> 05:11.333
In a lot of ways.

05:11.367 --> 05:13.066
"Manic" is a little much.

05:13.100 --> 05:15.033
- It is.
- I don't trust your reactions.

05:15.066 --> 05:17.367
It feels, like, kind of manic.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.033
- Kind of need that one
to be retracted.

05:19.066 --> 05:21.300
- I'm not taking that back.

05:21.333 --> 05:25.467
- Well, I think manic, because
she had confessed to you

05:25.500 --> 05:27.567
that her father
had committed suicide.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.567
- And he was manic.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.633
- I don't judge you based
on your father's story.

05:31.667 --> 05:33.266
- Right, but she just--

05:33.300 --> 05:34.533
she's just telling you why
it's a sensitive subject.

05:34.567 --> 05:35.700
- Sure. Okay.

05:35.734 --> 05:38.433
- Why it particularly
stung like a bee.

05:38.467 --> 05:39.700
- Okay, I take away
that you're manic,

05:39.734 --> 05:42.066
and I'm sorry that you feel bad
that I said that,

05:42.100 --> 05:43.467
and I won't say that again.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.433
- But don't say that
unless you believe it.

05:45.467 --> 05:47.100
- I said I won't say it--no,
no, I said I feel bad--

05:47.133 --> 05:48.367
- Don't say it
unless you truly--

05:48.400 --> 05:49.567
- Wait, Lisa.
- Don't say it.

05:49.600 --> 05:51.300
- Did you hear what I said?
- Say it again.

05:51.333 --> 05:52.433
Don't say it unless
you believe it.

05:52.467 --> 05:53.700
- I said I feel bad
that I said it.

05:53.734 --> 05:55.433
- Okay.
- And I won't say it again.

05:55.467 --> 05:57.633
- Okay, good.

05:57.667 --> 05:59.400
Hmm.

05:59.433 --> 06:00.567
This is definitely going

06:00.600 --> 06:04.367
in the non-apology
apology hall of fame.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.500
- Okay, if you guys apologize
to each other.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.100
We don't talk about it again.

06:08.133 --> 06:10.100
- But we gotta make sure
that you're okay. Are you okay?

06:10.133 --> 06:12.400
- I am more than happy
to move on from this.

06:12.433 --> 06:14.600
- Awesome. Good.
- So let's be done.

06:14.633 --> 06:16.533
- Let's forget about
being jealous.

06:16.567 --> 06:20.667
Let's forget about whatever
ugly pants we're wearing.

06:20.700 --> 06:25.400
This is me lowering
my expectations and moving on.

06:25.433 --> 06:27.367
- We don't want to ever

06:27.400 --> 06:29.433
feel like we're pushing
someone over the edge.

06:29.467 --> 06:30.600
- That's right.

06:30.633 --> 06:33.433
- That is mixed up.

06:33.467 --> 06:36.100
- Messed up?
- Messed up, mixed up.

06:36.133 --> 06:37.567
- You know what?
- No, but I'm serious.

06:37.600 --> 06:40.400
- Here's the thing, guys,
stay true to yourselves,

06:40.433 --> 06:44.133
take one day at a time,
and live in the moment.

06:44.166 --> 06:45.533
Right?
That's all we can do.

06:45.567 --> 06:47.100
- And lock your door.
- Right.

06:47.133 --> 06:48.600
- And lock your damn door.

06:48.633 --> 06:52.400
- Don't need to say that.
You don't need to say that.

06:52.433 --> 06:54.500
- I did.
- You gotta stop.

06:54.533 --> 06:56.400
- Shut up, Sutton.

06:56.433 --> 06:57.633
Just zip it.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.567
- I was making a joke.
Come on.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.166
- I know.
- Too soon.

07:03.200 --> 07:07.333
- I am drunk.
- Me too! Yay!

07:11.200 --> 07:14.133
- Hi, Kyle.
- Oh, Kyle.

07:14.166 --> 07:15.400
- You know I'm positive.

07:15.433 --> 07:16.567
You got my text.
-

07:16.600 --> 07:18.567
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.367
- Dorit has it also.

07:21.400 --> 07:26.367
- Kathy, Dorit, and I have
all tested positive for COVID.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.133
- How are you feeling?
'Cause you're in it.

07:28.166 --> 07:31.400
- Yeah. I just feel--you know
when you, like, don't feel good

07:31.433 --> 07:33.533
and you feel emotional?
I just feel, like, depressed.

07:33.567 --> 07:36.700
- Oh.
- So now, the entire group

07:36.734 --> 07:39.633
has to quarantine
for at least two weeks.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.200
- It's scary.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.734
- Coming up...

07:46.767 --> 07:49.567
- We are here for you, Erika.
We know who you are.

07:49.600 --> 07:53.367
You would not do this.
- I didn't do this.

08:05.500 --> 08:06.767
- Have you been
on social media,

08:07.000 --> 08:08.500
the news, anything at all?

08:08.533 --> 08:13.500
Something broke today about her
and Tom being sued.

08:16.734 --> 08:20.233
- Wow, this is on Fox News.

08:20.266 --> 08:24.066
- It's everywhere.
It's everywhere.

08:24.100 --> 08:26.600
- There's news reports
coming out that are alleging

08:26.633 --> 08:28.066
that Tom embezzled this money

08:28.100 --> 08:30.767
from victims
of this plane crash,

08:31.000 --> 08:34.233
and to see Erika's name
involved in it is shocking.

08:34.266 --> 08:37.567
- Seeing these headlines
makes you cringe.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.700
Sone of these victims,
they're widows, orphans.

08:40.734 --> 08:43.066
That's the punch in the gut.

08:43.100 --> 08:45.433
- You just can't imagine this
is somebody you know

08:45.467 --> 08:48.700
or you spend time with,
and this is possible.

08:50.300 --> 08:52.700
- Is this the tip
of the iceberg? I don't know.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.700
- I have no idea
if it's true or not.

08:56.734 --> 09:00.600
But I have to be able
to keep an open mind

09:00.633 --> 09:05.600
and say innocent
until proven guilty,

09:05.633 --> 09:09.567
because I'm going based
on the person that I know.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.266
- How are you?
- ----ing horrible.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.533
How do you think I am?
This sucks so bad.

09:15.567 --> 09:18.266
The things that are being said
are just wrong.

09:18.300 --> 09:21.467
People are believing them,
and they're everywhere,

09:21.500 --> 09:24.467
and it's terrible,
and I'm here by myself.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.300
And what's being said is
just--I mean,

09:26.333 --> 09:29.567
it's insane--that
my divorce is a sham.

09:29.600 --> 09:32.266
But nobody cares
about the facts.

09:32.300 --> 09:34.633
- So, when they say
it's a sham--

09:34.667 --> 09:36.500
- They said my divorce
is a sham

09:36.533 --> 09:40.567
so I can help hide assets.
The answer is no.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.667
- How do you hide assets
in a divorce, though?

09:43.700 --> 09:45.567
- I wouldn't ----ing know.

09:45.600 --> 09:47.100
Divorce is very painful.

09:47.133 --> 09:51.333
And then having it called
a sham is even more painful.

09:51.367 --> 09:53.066
Took a lot of courage
to leave,

09:53.100 --> 09:55.000
and it took two seconds
for some asshole

09:55.033 --> 09:58.333
to say it was a sham,
and everybody to believe it.

09:58.367 --> 10:02.066
When I filed this divorce,
I was a gold digger.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.333
This week,
"you're a conspirator."

10:04.367 --> 10:06.066
I mean, what the (BLEEP)?

10:06.100 --> 10:08.066
And none--neither
one of them are true.

10:08.100 --> 10:10.633
- Are you totally in the dark?
Like, what is the situation?

10:10.667 --> 10:13.033
- Well, you have to-you
have to remember, it's the firm

10:13.066 --> 10:16.066
that they're dragging in,
so they're suing the firm,

10:16.100 --> 10:18.500
and I'm being attached to it.

10:22.633 --> 10:23.734
- I can't answer that.

10:25.200 --> 10:28.100
I don't know
what happens from here.

10:28.133 --> 10:30.133
Some very bad things
could happen.

10:36.700 --> 10:39.033
- That is the answer--
that is the question.

10:40.633 --> 10:43.133
I don't know why
I would be named in a lawsuit

10:43.166 --> 10:44.734
I have nothing to do with.

10:44.767 --> 10:48.000
- Like, what is the worst?
- Criminal charges.

10:48.033 --> 10:49.700
- Not for you, though.
- No.

10:49.734 --> 10:51.100
- What does that mean exactly?

10:51.133 --> 10:53.633
- It could be
a criminal investigation.

10:53.667 --> 10:55.033
- Right.

10:55.066 --> 10:57.633
You know, when you
allege sh-- like that...

10:58.400 --> 10:59.600
- What does that mean?

10:59.633 --> 11:01.633
I'm scared to even say it.

11:01.667 --> 11:03.533
- Yeah.

11:03.567 --> 11:05.367
It means a lot of things.

11:05.400 --> 11:07.767
- Yeah.
- It's so ----ed up.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.200
I've got more lawyers
than I can ----ing afford.

11:11.233 --> 11:14.400
- Doesn't he have to take care
of that, since he's, you know?

11:14.433 --> 11:17.667
- Not right now, you know.
Not right now.

11:17.700 --> 11:19.367
Not with everything else
going on.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.066
I think I'm the least
of his worries.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.166
- Yeah.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.033
- And he hasn't given me
one dime

11:25.066 --> 11:27.600
since I've walked out
that door.

11:27.633 --> 11:31.000
So this is all on me.
- Yep.

11:31.033 --> 11:32.567
- To be out here on your own

11:32.600 --> 11:35.066
and to have, like,
millions of dollars

11:35.100 --> 11:39.367
worth of lawsuits
pointed out you is heavy.

11:39.400 --> 11:42.166
And to know that the person
that got you here

11:42.200 --> 11:45.400
has been like--

11:45.433 --> 11:48.433
you know, like,
what the am I gonna do?

11:48.467 --> 11:50.166
I wake up every morning
and I think about

11:50.200 --> 11:54.033
what I need to tackle
on a legal front every day.

11:54.066 --> 11:55.600
- Oh, my God, Erika.

11:55.633 --> 11:56.767
- It's just one
of those things.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.600
I mean, I--

11:58.633 --> 12:02.000
- How long could you
be dealing with this for?

12:02.033 --> 12:05.600
- God. Well over a year.
- Oh, my God.

12:05.633 --> 12:09.600
- You're strong, and you're
gonna get through this.

12:09.633 --> 12:12.400
- It's a lot.
It's depressing.

12:12.433 --> 12:16.600
- And being in this lockdown
doesn't help matters either.

12:16.633 --> 12:18.000
- God, no.

12:18.033 --> 12:20.166
- No, it gives me, like,
really high anxiety.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.133
- You can literally call me
any time you want to talk

12:23.166 --> 12:24.600
or you have anxiety.

12:24.633 --> 12:26.166
You know that I know
how to deal with anxiety.

12:26.200 --> 12:30.066
I can talk you through that
and be there to listen,

12:30.100 --> 12:31.767
and I'm not going anywhere.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.734
- Thank you.
- Me too. Me too.

12:33.767 --> 12:36.734
We are here for you, Erika.
We know who you are.

12:36.767 --> 12:39.066
You are a good person.

12:39.100 --> 12:42.266
- I didn't do this.
- I know.

12:42.300 --> 12:43.700
- I know that, Erika.

12:43.734 --> 12:45.433
- We know you didn't
do it, Erika.

12:45.467 --> 12:47.633
We know that this
is not who you are.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.233
You would not do this.

12:49.266 --> 12:52.633
- Didn't do this.
- I know, sweetie.

12:55.000 --> 12:55.767
- Coming up...

12:56.000 --> 12:57.200
- Makes you feel better

12:57.233 --> 12:59.100
if the person that you had
put up on a pedestal--

12:59.133 --> 13:02.467
- Is really a piece of sh--.
- Horrible allegations.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.133
You almost go, like,
is it the same person we know?

13:15.333 --> 13:17.100
- I feel like this is,
like, a never-ending

13:17.133 --> 13:18.767
----ing

13:25.233 --> 13:26.700
- Hello, hello!

13:27.166 --> 13:30.066
- Hi.
- Hello!

13:30.100 --> 13:33.333
- Come on in.
- Hi.

13:33.367 --> 13:35.333
- Is he getting on your nerves?
- Oh, are you kidding me?

13:35.367 --> 13:37.000
- Stop leaning on everybody.

13:37.033 --> 13:40.266
- Are you kidding?
I love-I love this.

13:40.300 --> 13:41.500
- Do you want something?

13:41.533 --> 13:43.000
May I get you
something to drink?

13:43.033 --> 13:44.133
- Should we go outside?
- We can.

13:44.166 --> 13:46.000
I just don't know where she is.

13:46.033 --> 13:47.166
- Hi.
- Oh, there she is.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.300
Oh, my God.
- Yes. There we go.

13:48.333 --> 13:49.700
- How are you?

13:49.734 --> 13:51.033
- Hi.
- You look adorable.

13:51.066 --> 13:52.200
-
I have lots of liquid for you.

13:52.233 --> 13:53.467
- Yay. Thank you.

13:53.500 --> 13:57.333
Well, welcome to the unfinished
little bungalow.

13:57.367 --> 13:59.166
This house is very small.

13:59.200 --> 14:00.300
- It gives me the chills.
I love it.

14:00.333 --> 14:03.033
Don't say it's small.
It's not small.

14:03.066 --> 14:04.300
- Girl.
- Don't--

14:04.333 --> 14:06.033
- Let me grab my purse.
- Okay, bring your purse,

14:06.066 --> 14:07.033
and we'll go--
we'll sit outside.

14:07.066 --> 14:08.300
- Oh, okay.

14:08.333 --> 14:10.233
- Because the best part
of this house is outside.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.300
Come on in here.

14:12.333 --> 14:15.166
- Look at this cute pool.
I love this pool.

14:15.200 --> 14:19.000
It's just a great backyard.
It's a great vibe.

14:19.033 --> 14:21.166
- Champagne?
- I love it.

14:21.200 --> 14:24.767
- Well, you know my new motto.
Why not?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.767
- I know. Like, yesterday,
I was like, "It's 3:30.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.533
Is it too soon
to have a cocktail?"

14:28.567 --> 14:30.200
- The answer is no.
- It's not.

14:30.233 --> 14:32.767
- I hold on so long, at the end
of the day, I'm like--

14:33.000 --> 14:34.233
- Well, you've got little kids.

14:34.266 --> 14:35.600
- Sometimes I just burst
into tears

14:35.633 --> 14:37.133
- I'm sure you do.
- It's really bad.

14:37.166 --> 14:38.233
- That's hard.

14:38.266 --> 14:39.333
- Here's to bursting
into tears.

14:39.367 --> 14:41.200
-
it's hard.

14:42.300 --> 14:43.567
- Bursting into my own
set of tears.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.133
- Have you been
bursting into tears?

14:45.166 --> 14:46.133
- Yeah, I have been.

14:48.633 --> 14:52.333
- Hello?

14:52.367 --> 14:56.133
- I am in front of your house.
Hello.

14:56.166 --> 14:58.767
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

14:59.000 --> 15:00.367
- I'm better.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.133
- Let's be safe.

15:05.166 --> 15:06.333
- Walk along the side
of the house

15:06.367 --> 15:07.567
and come to the backyard.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.066
- Okay.

15:11.333 --> 15:12.767
- Hello?

15:14.033 --> 15:15.400
Hello?

15:18.367 --> 15:19.600
Garcelle?

15:19.633 --> 15:22.367
- Yeah?
- Hi.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.367
Oh, my God. I feel so--

15:24.400 --> 15:27.633
- Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
let down your hair.

15:27.667 --> 15:29.233
- I know.
My hair with the gray roots.

15:29.266 --> 15:32.333
- Oh my God. Listen.
You look good, considering.

15:32.367 --> 15:34.300
- I mean--let get my dog.

15:34.333 --> 15:35.600
Get over here.
- Okay.

15:35.633 --> 15:37.233
Well, while you do that,
I'm gonna put this down.

15:37.266 --> 15:41.133
I'll put it on
your pedestal here, I guess.

15:41.166 --> 15:42.600
Kyle and I have come
a long way.

15:42.633 --> 15:45.133
- Then you came to
my charity event,

15:45.166 --> 15:48.066
raised your paddle
to donate $5,000

15:48.100 --> 15:51.100
to Children's Hospital
Los Angeles, and never paid.

15:51.133 --> 15:53.233
- What? You better watch
what you're saying.

15:53.266 --> 15:55.000
That is not true.

15:55.033 --> 15:57.200
You saying I didn't pay,
that's why it hurt so much.

15:57.233 --> 16:00.233
- I totally understand.
And for that, I apologize.

16:00.266 --> 16:01.433
- Thank you.

16:01.467 --> 16:05.100
I can't believe now
I'm Romeo to her Juliet.

16:05.133 --> 16:08.200
Although, I'm not
drinking poison for her.

16:08.233 --> 16:10.667
Uh-uh.
I still don't have my boys.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.633
- Oh, my God.
- I spend by birthday alone.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.200
- I still haven't seen
my family.

16:14.233 --> 16:15.400
They-they hightailed it
out of here.

16:15.433 --> 16:16.633
- They did go to the desert?

16:16.667 --> 16:19.066
- My-my husband
was burning rubber.

16:19.100 --> 16:20.266
He was like,
"I hope you're okay."

16:20.300 --> 16:22.233
Like, I mean, done.

16:22.266 --> 16:25.300
So ironic to me that on
"Little House on the Prairie,"

16:25.333 --> 16:28.233
there was an episode called
"Quarantine,"

16:28.266 --> 16:32.100
where I had scarlet fever
and was in isolation.

16:32.133 --> 16:33.266
- No, papa. Hot.

16:33.300 --> 16:34.500
- This is the drink

16:34.533 --> 16:36.100
It'll be good
for your throat and your mouth.

16:36.133 --> 16:37.433
- No, papa. Hot water.

16:37.467 --> 16:39.667
- This is one time
where I really did not

16:39.700 --> 16:41.667
need life to imitate art.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.700
So, they're gonna
come home tomorrow.

16:43.734 --> 16:45.233
- Oh, that's good.

16:45.266 --> 16:47.100
- So, now that I'm better,
Kathy's better,

16:47.133 --> 16:48.433
Dorit is better,

16:48.467 --> 16:51.266
we want to finally do
our girls' trip to La Quinta.

16:51.300 --> 16:53.100
- What?
- Yes!

16:53.133 --> 16:54.433
I want to come sneeze
on you, Garcelle.

16:54.467 --> 16:56.300
- I'm not going anywhere--
you guys have cooties.

16:56.333 --> 16:57.700
I'm not going
anywhere you're going.

16:57.734 --> 16:59.433
- Kathy, Dorit, and I
are the safest people

16:59.467 --> 17:01.100
to be around right now.

17:01.133 --> 17:03.066
- Yeah, that's true.
I may have to call

17:03.100 --> 17:05.066
Naomi Campbell
and get her hazmat suit.

17:05.100 --> 17:06.433
- Yeah, exactly.

17:06.467 --> 17:08.433
I'll send an email
to everybody.

17:08.467 --> 17:11.066
- And Erika's coming.
- I'm assuming.

17:11.100 --> 17:12.667
I'm gonna invite everyone.
- Okay.

17:12.700 --> 17:17.133
- How are you, Erika?
- I'm not good.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.200
I called my psychiatrist.

17:19.233 --> 17:20.533
- Good.
- Important.

17:20.567 --> 17:22.200
- It's too much pressure.

17:22.233 --> 17:23.533
So painful when
you read things...

17:23.567 --> 17:25.300
- I know.

17:25.333 --> 17:28.367
- About that lawsuit that says
that my divorce is a sham

17:28.400 --> 17:31.467
so I could hide assets.
Does this look--

17:31.500 --> 17:33.433
- Doesn't look like
you're hiding any assets.

17:33.467 --> 17:36.266
No.
- That has big implications,

17:36.300 --> 17:38.200
and unfortunately
people want to believe that.

17:38.233 --> 17:39.567
- Why? It's horrible.
- You know,

17:39.600 --> 17:41.700
it makes you feel better
if all of a sudden the person

17:41.734 --> 17:43.266
that you had
put up on a pedestal...

17:43.300 --> 17:46.300
- Is really a piece of sh--,

17:46.333 --> 17:48.166
really steals from widows
and orphans.

17:48.200 --> 17:49.333
- But why do people want that?

17:49.367 --> 17:51.100
- And then they go, "See?
I knew it."

17:51.133 --> 17:53.266
- Because there's a sadistic
streak in everybody.

17:53.300 --> 17:56.133
People think that Erika Jayne
brought down Tom Girardi.

17:56.166 --> 17:58.133
Tom Girardi
brought down Tom Girardi.

17:58.166 --> 18:01.200
I don't want his actions
to absolutely kill

18:01.233 --> 18:04.500
what I have created.
I fear starting over.

18:04.533 --> 18:08.467
The only thing I have
is my name,

18:08.500 --> 18:14.500
and the hope that this is not
where this ends for me.

18:14.533 --> 18:17.533
Those who know you know,
but if you've never had to deal

18:17.567 --> 18:20.200
with anything like this,
then of course it's easy

18:20.233 --> 18:23.467
to believe everything
that's put out there.

18:23.500 --> 18:26.200
- Every day,
it's something more.

18:26.233 --> 18:27.300
- With Erika.

18:27.333 --> 18:28.433
- Yeah.
- I know.

18:28.467 --> 18:30.266
- Horrible allegations.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.233
To think that people
passed away--it's horrible.

18:32.266 --> 18:33.734
Has she said anything
to anybody?

18:33.767 --> 18:35.500
- I mean, I've spoken to her
a couple times,

18:35.533 --> 18:37.567
and she just said
it's been really, really hard.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.500
And she said,
"I didn't do these things.

18:39.533 --> 18:40.767
I did not do these"--

18:41.000 --> 18:42.533
- She actually said that.
- She said that.

18:42.567 --> 18:44.200
- But, like, this stuff

18:44.233 --> 18:47.467
that came--were
you--did you know?

18:47.500 --> 18:49.266
Oh, wow.

18:50.333 --> 18:52.567
- I ask myself
what else is coming?

18:52.600 --> 18:55.233
- Do you have any idea?
- None.

18:55.266 --> 18:57.233
It's not just Tom
going down with the ship.

18:57.266 --> 18:58.433
He's taking us
all down with him.

18:58.467 --> 19:00.367
- You seem like you have
a very good head

19:00.400 --> 19:01.600
on your shoulders,
dealing with this.

19:01.633 --> 19:03.333
This is-this would be
really intense. I mean--

19:03.367 --> 19:04.767
- She's smart. You know.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.300
- The people that stayed
with him,

19:06.333 --> 19:07.500
the people that were loyal
to him,

19:07.533 --> 19:09.266
he's brought it on them
as well,

19:09.300 --> 19:10.433
through whatever he's done.

19:10.467 --> 19:11.767
We don't even know
what he's done.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.333
But he's made a mess
for all of us.

19:14.367 --> 19:17.533
It's mile one of a marathon.
And that's really the truth.

19:19.266 --> 19:21.533
- It's unbelievable.
You almost go, like,

19:21.567 --> 19:23.533
"Is it the same person
we know?" Like--

19:23.567 --> 19:25.433
- Just knowing her like I do,
I'm like,

19:25.467 --> 19:26.600
"This just
is not ringing true."

19:26.633 --> 19:28.500
- Yeah, you've known her
a lot longer than-

19:28.533 --> 19:30.567
- Yeah.
- Than me, obviously. Horrible.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.300
- Nightmare.
- Yeah.

19:32.333 --> 19:33.467
- One of the reasons
I don't think this divorce

19:33.500 --> 19:35.467
is a shame is maybe Erika,

19:35.500 --> 19:37.600
once she found out
these lawsuits were coming,

19:37.633 --> 19:40.367
decided, "I'm not
staying around for this,"

19:40.400 --> 19:42.567
and decided,
"I'm gonna get out of here."

19:42.600 --> 19:45.033
- Maybe Tom did these things.

19:45.066 --> 19:46.467
But I don't think
Erika knew about it.

19:46.500 --> 19:49.467
One thing that I do know is
that husbands can have secrets

19:49.500 --> 19:52.333
that wives don't know about.

19:52.367 --> 19:54.567
- But obviously, when you're
married and you trust someone

19:54.600 --> 19:56.233
and you-you love them

19:56.266 --> 19:57.533
and you've spent
that many years together...

19:57.567 --> 20:00.033
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You know, you just trust.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.367
- Blindly sometimes.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.400
- I'm gonna give you a lesson
that I've learned.

20:04.433 --> 20:07.300
When I entered my marriage,
I was 28 years old,

20:07.333 --> 20:10.266
and the power balance
was like this. Right?

20:10.300 --> 20:12.467
You see what's happening
to me today.

20:12.500 --> 20:14.433
Please look
at your bank accounts.

20:14.467 --> 20:16.500
- Yeah.
- You have to.

20:16.533 --> 20:18.433
- I deal with all
the living stuff.

20:18.467 --> 20:22.033
But, like, when it--like--like,
a bank account freaks me out.

20:22.066 --> 20:23.367
- Please...

20:23.400 --> 20:24.500
- Don't ignore it.
- Yes, I know.

20:24.533 --> 20:26.400
- You need to know...
- Yes.

20:26.433 --> 20:29.333
- Where your money is, what's
coming in, what's going out.

20:29.367 --> 20:31.333
Like, you need
to know everything.

20:31.367 --> 20:32.467
Most women don't know.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.333
- Totally.
- A lot of these women

20:34.367 --> 20:37.600
that I know don't really work
or make their own money.

20:37.633 --> 20:40.033
But I'm the one
who pays the bills.

20:40.066 --> 20:42.667
What if, God forbid,
one day, Rob's gone?

20:42.700 --> 20:44.600
With Harry and I,
everything is joint,

20:44.633 --> 20:48.300
except for we each have
our own personal account.

20:48.333 --> 20:52.333
So I've always known
where the money is

20:52.367 --> 20:54.367
and where the dead bodies
are hidden and buried.

20:55.767 --> 20:58.400
- I think also, too, the more
money your husband makes,

20:58.433 --> 20:59.633
the more they shut you out.

20:59.667 --> 21:03.100
And then 22 years later,
it doesn't end up great.

21:03.133 --> 21:06.633
- I don't know every detail
about our financial situation.

21:06.667 --> 21:11.633
But I know Rob would be happy
to share it with me.

21:11.667 --> 21:15.667
And if he didn't, that would be
a red flag for me.

21:15.700 --> 21:17.300
- If you were to do it
differently,

21:17.333 --> 21:18.500
now that you know
what you know,

21:18.533 --> 21:20.066
and you're going through

21:20.100 --> 21:21.500
what you're going through,
or don't--

21:21.533 --> 21:23.066
- Or I don't know
what I don't know

21:23.100 --> 21:24.433
- Exactly--what would
you do differently?

21:24.467 --> 21:25.500
- Right.

21:27.400 --> 21:28.500
- I don't know that
there's anything--

21:28.533 --> 21:30.467
I could have done
anything differently,

21:30.500 --> 21:33.400
'cause I kept asking, and
I was continuously shut out.

21:33.433 --> 21:34.633
- Oh!

21:34.667 --> 21:36.433
- Okay.
- Two years ago,

21:36.467 --> 21:39.100
when I was named
in a lawsuit in Arizona,

21:39.133 --> 21:41.533
I was like,
"I didn't do anything."

21:41.567 --> 21:43.734
And then I went home
and I said, "What is this?"

21:43.767 --> 21:46.667
And he said, "It's bullsh--.
Don't worry about it."

21:46.700 --> 21:48.533
And when I pressed further,

21:48.567 --> 21:49.667
"I don't want to
talk about it."

21:49.700 --> 21:53.667
I pleaded, I begged,
I cried, I tried.

21:53.700 --> 21:56.567
I pushed as hard as I could,
until I couldn't push anymore.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.533
- Right.
- I know how mean

21:58.567 --> 22:04.300
and how vicious and how utterly
dismissive Tom is.

22:04.333 --> 22:06.600
Tom wins. You lose.
The end.

22:06.633 --> 22:09.100
That's the way
it's always been.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.567
- Coming up...

22:17.400 --> 22:18.533
-
- Sue.

22:18.567 --> 22:20.433
Awhoo!

22:41.200 --> 22:43.433
- Hi!
- Hi.

22:43.467 --> 22:45.200
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

22:45.233 --> 22:47.567
- How are you?
- We're good.

22:56.066 --> 22:57.567
- You guys are so cute.

22:57.600 --> 23:00.033
Delilah has been dating
Eyal Booker

23:00.066 --> 23:02.633
for over a year now.

23:02.667 --> 23:05.200
Amelia watched "Love Island."

23:05.233 --> 23:06.767
She saw Eyal, and she said,

23:07.000 --> 23:09.667
"Eyal is a male version
of Delilah."

23:09.700 --> 23:13.667
So Delilah slid into his DMs.

23:13.700 --> 23:15.400
I know how these girls work.

23:17.767 --> 23:19.633
- Be patient, always.

23:19.667 --> 23:21.767
And, you know, half the time
they're on their period,

23:22.000 --> 23:23.600
so you always
have to remember that.

23:23.633 --> 23:25.500
He has started
a fitness business,

23:25.533 --> 23:27.500
'cause if you've seen his body,

23:27.533 --> 23:30.567
this is a creature
like no other.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.500
I want to show you something

23:32.533 --> 23:34.500
that I told you
that I still have.

23:34.533 --> 23:36.000
It's so--

23:36.033 --> 23:38.533
- It's so silly,
but it's here in the garage,

23:38.567 --> 23:40.033
but I want to show it to you.

23:42.033 --> 23:44.600
- You know what, I gotta-I
gotta deal with this situation.

23:44.633 --> 23:47.633
I'm not kidding. All my good
dresses are down here.

23:47.667 --> 23:49.500
It's even on a wire hanger.

23:49.533 --> 23:51.033
Hang on.
How do I show you this?

23:51.066 --> 23:52.700
I'm just gonna put it down
on the floor.

23:52.734 --> 23:55.467
It's all right.
Look at this.

23:56.300 --> 23:57.700
- Look how gorgeous it is.

23:59.100 --> 24:01.066
- Well, I saved it for you.

24:01.100 --> 24:04.233
Some parents pass along
gun collections,

24:04.266 --> 24:06.066
stamp collections.

24:06.100 --> 24:08.633
I pass along vintage dresses.

24:08.667 --> 24:12.233
No one's ever asked me for them
and no one's ever said,

24:12.266 --> 24:13.600
"I want to wear the"--

24:15.266 --> 24:16.734
- Well, I can't do that.

24:16.767 --> 24:19.700
You don't want those dresses
in your main closet,

24:19.734 --> 24:21.033
'cause there was no room.

24:21.066 --> 24:22.700
Well, at least not
in my main closet.

24:22.734 --> 24:25.734
So, it is in the garage.
And it's not fancy.

24:25.767 --> 24:27.767
And it's dirty.
And it's not cute.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.700
This dress was $5,000
when we bought it,

24:30.734 --> 24:33.633
so it's got to be worth
probably 20 now.

24:33.667 --> 24:35.567
It's an original Herve Leger.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.100
I mean, they don't even
make them anymore. It's done.

24:38.133 --> 24:40.700
But they're all protected.
They're covered.

24:40.734 --> 24:42.266
And they're fine.

24:42.300 --> 24:44.533
And now I've great
locks and padlocks,

24:44.567 --> 24:45.734
and things on those doors,

24:45.767 --> 24:48.567
so don't think about
coming for my dresses.

24:48.600 --> 24:50.600
They're locked away.

24:50.633 --> 24:53.600
I have a Versace
that Gianni Versace made me

24:53.633 --> 24:55.667
when I was pregnant with you.

24:56.600 --> 24:57.700
- That one's yours.

25:00.066 --> 25:02.700
- You can probably wear it
before you're pregnant, I bet.

25:02.734 --> 25:04.300
Maybe after you
just have a burrito,

25:04.333 --> 25:05.667
you'll probably be fine.

25:05.700 --> 25:09.000
When we finally got the dress,
with my pregnancy,

25:09.033 --> 25:11.567
I had gotten bigger,
and it didn't fit in the back.

25:11.600 --> 25:13.033
I'm, like,
an organized hoarder.

25:13.066 --> 25:14.600
I knew exactly where it was.

25:14.633 --> 25:16.633
So Harry runs down
to the garage

25:16.667 --> 25:20.066
and gets a pair of pliers,
and somehow is able to fix

25:20.100 --> 25:23.300
the dress in the back
and make it fit, of course.

25:23.333 --> 25:26.500
Excuse me
while I move the gas can.

25:26.533 --> 25:29.734
This is a vintage
Tom Ford Gucci,

25:29.767 --> 25:31.734
with the gold belt.

25:31.767 --> 25:33.100
Like--

25:36.133 --> 25:38.100
- You guys always thought
I was weird,

25:38.133 --> 25:40.000
and now you all of a sudden
think I'm cool

25:40.033 --> 25:42.633
because you realize
what good sh-- I have.

25:42.667 --> 25:44.133
I worked hard
for these dresses.

25:44.166 --> 25:45.734
I bought them myself.

25:45.767 --> 25:48.100
And I'm an only child,
and I don't like to share.

25:48.133 --> 25:50.000
So the fact that I've saved
these dresses

25:50.033 --> 25:52.100
to share with the girls
is a big deal for me.

25:52.133 --> 25:54.133
I'll show you--if you want
to come here,

25:54.166 --> 25:55.700
I'll show you
my little private stash.

25:55.734 --> 25:58.000
I really gotta get
this nice, though.

25:58.033 --> 25:59.700
My expectations are not high.

25:59.734 --> 26:01.100
I think it's gonna be

26:01.133 --> 26:02.734
one Instagram shot
and forgotten about.

26:02.767 --> 26:04.333
You can come and wear
anything you want.

26:04.367 --> 26:06.000
- You want to know something?
- What?

26:06.033 --> 26:09.600
- Amelia told me that she's
your favorite child.

26:09.633 --> 26:11.700
So you can make it
up to me with--

26:11.734 --> 26:13.700
- I don't have
a favorite child.

26:13.734 --> 26:15.667
I love you both the same.

26:15.700 --> 26:17.667
- Yeah, I'll be telling
my kids that too,

26:17.700 --> 26:19.767
but I won't mean it.
- Ah!

26:20.633 --> 26:23.166
- Oh, my God,
you guys--killing me.

26:28.033 --> 26:31.133
- Sue. Come here.

26:31.166 --> 26:33.133
Awoo!

26:34.200 --> 26:36.767
- Awoo.
-

26:37.000 --> 26:39.166
- Ah-oo!

26:39.200 --> 26:40.667
Arf.

26:40.700 --> 26:43.600
Sue. Awoo!

26:43.633 --> 26:46.133
- Hi.
- Hi, honey. How are you?

26:46.166 --> 26:47.633
- I'm good.
I'm not hugging.

26:47.667 --> 26:49.233
- Mwah, mwah, mwah,
mwah, mwah, mwah.

26:49.266 --> 26:51.066
- Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah.
Oh my God, these are so pretty.

26:51.100 --> 26:53.033
- I have been working on these.
- I should be doing this.

26:53.066 --> 26:55.633
- These are all my--
my new collection.

26:55.667 --> 26:58.133
- I love them.

26:58.166 --> 27:00.100
- Aren't they pretty?

27:00.133 --> 27:01.767
- Look at this one,
with the creepy looking doll.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.600
- The little girl.
- Oh, that doll is terrifying.

27:04.633 --> 27:06.166
- No, look at--her eyes open.

27:06.200 --> 27:07.433
- Demented.

27:07.467 --> 27:09.700
- No.
She's a little vintage girl.

27:09.734 --> 27:11.700
- Looks like "What
Happened to Baby Jane?" to me.

27:11.734 --> 27:13.700
- Well, I'll let you know
I love that.

27:13.734 --> 27:16.633
I always come up
with all my little fantasies.

27:16.667 --> 27:21.200
I could see, you know, angels
or soldiers, teddy bears,

27:21.233 --> 27:25.233
crystal fruit, vintage snowmen,
little miniature shoes,

27:25.266 --> 27:29.633
an old Saks Fifth Avenue
receipt--absolutely beautiful.

27:29.667 --> 27:32.166
- I'm having--not having
a good day.

27:32.200 --> 27:35.100
- What's wrong?
- Just really depressed.

27:35.133 --> 27:38.166
Really just--it's all
getting to me.

27:38.200 --> 27:40.700
- You know what,
it's a very emotional thing,

27:40.734 --> 27:42.700
getting COVID.

27:42.734 --> 27:44.233
- For me,
it's the parenting thing.

27:44.266 --> 27:48.200
I don't even feel like
I can do a good job right now.

27:48.233 --> 27:50.166
I really don't.
It's like--

27:50.200 --> 27:51.633
- You're the best.

27:51.667 --> 27:55.033
- But I-I feel like
I can't do anything.

27:56.233 --> 27:59.033
Portia's so little,
and she can't do anything.

27:59.066 --> 28:01.633
She can't go anywhere.
She's just, like, home.

28:01.667 --> 28:03.233
- I know, honey, it's hard.

28:03.266 --> 28:07.000
- I've always prided myself
on being a really good mom.

28:07.033 --> 28:08.700
That's, like, my thing,
you know?

28:08.734 --> 28:12.066
It's my favorite thing.
What I'm best at.

28:12.100 --> 28:14.734
So I don't like to see
my child not at her best.

28:14.767 --> 28:17.133
Why have you missed
some of your classes, honey?

28:17.166 --> 28:19.734
- The other day, I missed
my first two classes...

28:28.266 --> 28:31.266
- It's 12:30.
My kid as asleep when I left.

28:33.033 --> 28:35.133
What am I gonna do? Wake her?
There's nothing to do.

28:35.166 --> 28:37.266
Just makes me feel like
I'm not doing a good job.

28:37.300 --> 28:39.000
- Yeah, sure.
- If I had done things

28:39.033 --> 28:40.667
in the past, I could have
kept up dancing for her,

28:40.700 --> 28:43.100
have somebody come privately,
outside, or something,

28:43.133 --> 28:45.266
but I can't even do that.

28:45.300 --> 28:49.233
I hear so many people say,
"Oh, my kids are missing

28:49.266 --> 28:51.233
their friends and missing
going and doing this,"

28:51.266 --> 28:54.734
and my worry's actually
the opposite,

28:54.767 --> 28:56.500
seeing Portia
being comfortable

28:56.533 --> 28:58.066
not going to school,

28:58.100 --> 29:01.767
not seeing people,
not leaving your home.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.100
That is what worries me
as a mom.

29:04.133 --> 29:07.066
I'm trying so hard
to keep her with kids her age.

29:07.100 --> 29:08.500
- Right. That's important.

29:08.533 --> 29:10.533
- And she's so mature as it is
that it's like,

29:10.567 --> 29:12.000
I want her to be a kid.

29:12.033 --> 29:14.000
- And not just be
with the older sisters.

29:14.033 --> 29:15.133
- Exactly.

29:15.166 --> 29:16.500
- 'Cause they're on
different pages.

29:16.533 --> 29:18.266
- Well, you know I would
never normally allow her

29:18.300 --> 29:19.767
to have those long nails.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.734
What are your teachers
thinking about those nails?

29:21.767 --> 29:23.200
- I'm like this.
They don't see my--

29:23.233 --> 29:24.533
it only shows, like, here.

29:24.567 --> 29:26.300
- How can you even type
with those nails?

29:26.333 --> 29:28.500
- 'Cause I'm a queen.

29:28.533 --> 29:30.500
- But she has nothing to do,
so she wants to play

29:30.533 --> 29:33.033
with makeup at home
and put on these things

29:33.066 --> 29:34.767
and take them out
and put--what?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.266
I mean, am I gonna say no?
For what?

29:37.300 --> 29:40.200
There, like, new rules,
even, anymore.

29:40.233 --> 29:43.233
- You're not alone.
Everyone's feeling this.

29:43.266 --> 29:44.700
- Really?

29:44.734 --> 29:47.166
- Kyle and I were not
on good terms for a while.

29:47.200 --> 29:49.300
- Since "American Woman,"
it's not like it was before.

29:49.333 --> 29:52.266
We did everything together,
talked every single day,

29:52.300 --> 29:54.100
ten times a day.
It's not like that.

29:54.133 --> 29:58.333
- It feels wonderful to
be there for Kyle and for Kyle

29:58.367 --> 30:00.367
to be there for me
if I need her.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.233
- Just one of those days,
you know?

30:02.266 --> 30:03.567
- You have to get it
off your chest.

30:03.600 --> 30:06.767
- And I know it could be
so much worst.

30:07.000 --> 30:09.033
I spoke to Erika, and--

30:09.066 --> 30:12.533
- How is she doing?
- Not good.

30:12.567 --> 30:14.200
She was just saying--just,
like, the headlines

30:14.233 --> 30:17.200
and the things out there
about her that aren't true,

30:17.233 --> 30:19.100
and she can't defend
or explain herself.

30:19.133 --> 30:23.100
- Look, at the end of the day,
life is a poker game,

30:23.133 --> 30:25.333
and everybody's got
to show their cards.

30:26.767 --> 30:30.033
- Kathy, shut up.

30:30.066 --> 30:32.100
- Coming up...

30:32.133 --> 30:35.300
-
Kyle, this is so hard.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.333
I could have never predicted
this-this ----ing sh--.

30:38.367 --> 30:40.767
- Ever.
- Ever.

30:50.333 --> 30:53.166
- Waylon. Waylon. Waylon.

30:53.200 --> 30:55.233
Way. Way. Way. Mm-mm.

30:57.367 --> 31:00.066
Are you stuck?
Come here. Come on, Way.

31:02.266 --> 31:04.367
- Oh, my goodness. Oh!
- Oh, my goodness.

31:04.400 --> 31:07.166
- Oh, my goodness. It's Waylon!
- Oh, my goodness.

31:07.200 --> 31:11.166
- Hello, my gorgeous boy!

31:11.200 --> 31:13.400
This is like having
a toddler with teeth.

31:13.433 --> 31:17.300
- Don't tell Kyle, but we-we
may have eaten a little...

31:17.333 --> 31:18.433
- Oh, well, I'm sure...

31:18.467 --> 31:20.100
- Piece.
- You'll-you'll fix it.

31:20.133 --> 31:21.233
- Yeah.
- I'm sure.

31:21.266 --> 31:22.633
- The unmentionable.

31:22.667 --> 31:24.367
- Little crown molding here
and there. Little molding.

31:24.400 --> 31:25.433
- Porter's here.
- Hello.

31:25.467 --> 31:26.633
- Hi, Porter.
- Hello.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.400
- How are you?
- I'm good.

31:28.433 --> 31:30.033
- It's nice to see you.
- It's nice to meet you again.

31:30.066 --> 31:31.200
- Little faraway hug.

31:31.233 --> 31:32.300
- Faraway hug.
- I know. You've met.

31:32.333 --> 31:33.467
- We met, I think...
- We did--

31:33.500 --> 31:35.133
- At the store.
- We met--

31:35.166 --> 31:36.200
- That's right,
at the store opening.

31:36.233 --> 31:37.433
- Yeah.
- We met briefly.

31:37.467 --> 31:39.200
- I need to have the girls
over for brunch again.

31:39.233 --> 31:40.633
- We need to do that.
- Now I'm a pescatarian.

31:40.667 --> 31:43.367
But I'll eat.
- What!

31:43.400 --> 31:45.300
- She likes fried fish, though.
- I like--yeah.

31:45.333 --> 31:47.333
- Porter is my oldest.

31:47.367 --> 31:51.066
She's a freshman
in college this year.

31:51.100 --> 31:53.300
She's a girly girl, like me.

31:53.333 --> 31:58.066
And she is very quiet,
unlike me.

31:58.100 --> 31:59.300
- Well, grab a sandwich
or something if you want.

31:59.333 --> 32:01.066
- Oh, yum.
- We can take these nuts out.

32:01.100 --> 32:03.333
- She's double majoring
in history and French,

32:03.367 --> 32:06.266
so she's very smart.
And she loves music.

32:06.300 --> 32:08.333
She has a beautifully voice.
She plays the piano.

32:08.367 --> 32:11.467
And she's, like,
a mother's dream.

32:11.500 --> 32:14.133
- I miss everybody, you know?
- I do miss everybody.

32:14.166 --> 32:15.300
- I do.

32:15.333 --> 32:17.233
- I've been, like,
texting with Dorit.

32:17.266 --> 32:19.066
- She just got cleared
in order to see us.

32:19.100 --> 32:20.433
- To see-and to see her kids.
- To see people.

32:20.467 --> 32:22.133
- I know.
- It's so bad.

32:22.166 --> 32:23.367
- Well, not being able
to see the kids.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.667
- Oh.

32:24.700 --> 32:26.233
- I just kept thinking about
how torturous

32:26.266 --> 32:28.133
that was for you or is for you.

32:28.166 --> 32:29.367
- They didn't understand,

32:29.400 --> 32:31.066
and "I don't care
if I'll get it, Mommy.

32:31.100 --> 32:32.333
I don't care,"
screaming, crying.

32:32.367 --> 32:34.133
"I'll get it, Mommy.
Please, let me get it."

32:34.166 --> 32:36.667
- Oh!
So tell me about college.

32:36.700 --> 32:38.367
- It was really, like, hard
to meet people,

32:38.400 --> 32:40.233
I think, in the beginning.
And then I joined a sorority.

32:40.266 --> 32:41.367
- Oh, good.
- And that helped a lot.

32:41.400 --> 32:42.700
And so I met some friends--

32:42.734 --> 32:44.333
- What sorority is it?
- Kappa Kappa Gamma.

32:44.367 --> 32:45.500
- That's what I was.
- Really?

32:45.533 --> 32:47.200
- Shut up!

32:47.233 --> 32:48.367
- I was a Kappa Kappa Gamma
for five minutes.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.467
I only went to college...

32:49.500 --> 32:50.734
- Five minutes.
- For one term.

32:50.767 --> 32:52.400
- We're sisters.

32:52.433 --> 32:54.333
- So it doesn't really count,
but I was a Kappa Kappa Gamma!

32:54.367 --> 32:58.533
- That is lovely.
- Whoo!

32:58.567 --> 33:00.467
I missed out
on a lot of good keggers.

33:00.500 --> 33:02.300
I should have stayed.

33:02.333 --> 33:05.133
- It must be a very smart group
of women

33:05.166 --> 33:06.300
that join Kappa Kappa Gamma.

33:06.333 --> 33:07.400
- Right?

33:07.433 --> 33:09.200
- We're called Kappa
Kappa Geniuses.

33:09.233 --> 33:10.533
- Oh.
- Ooh!

33:10.567 --> 33:12.500
- Oh! See? There you go.
You're a Kappa Kappa Genius.

33:12.533 --> 33:14.333
- Yes.
- I'll take it.

33:14.367 --> 33:16.734
At the time, I don't think
it was the nerd sorority.

33:16.767 --> 33:21.367
150 years ago, it was actually
the "cool girl" sorority, okay?

33:21.400 --> 33:22.767
- It's so nice
to have her home.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.333
- What a beauty.

33:24.367 --> 33:28.166
- Well, you have beauties.
And so you do kind of go...

33:28.200 --> 33:30.200
- Wow.
- "Please, boys..."

33:30.233 --> 33:31.266
- I know.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.333
- "Just stay away."

33:33.367 --> 33:35.200
- Was she strict?
Or is she strict?

33:35.233 --> 33:37.500
- She was, like,
strict with me.

33:37.533 --> 33:40.266
- Porter is not allowed
to have lip fillers.

33:40.300 --> 33:43.500
And I'm strict
with how you dress.

33:43.533 --> 33:47.266
Calling adults by "Mr."
and "Mrs."

33:47.300 --> 33:50.467
"Please" and "thank yous."
Curfews. Boys.

33:50.500 --> 33:52.734
I try to preserve
my kids being kids.

33:52.767 --> 33:54.734
- You have the prettiest eyes.
- Thank you. You too.

33:54.767 --> 33:56.533
- You're gorgeous.
- Wonder where she got those.

33:56.567 --> 33:58.300
- Yeah, I wonder.

33:58.333 --> 34:00.533
- They gon' stay little for
as long as they can.

34:00.567 --> 34:02.533
And they're gonna play
Uno with me at home

34:02.567 --> 34:06.367
on Saturday night.
And like it.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.166
Porter is 18.

34:08.200 --> 34:09.533
- Yes.
- And Amelia's 19.

34:09.567 --> 34:11.266
- Correct.
- Yes.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.467
- We need to, like,
have a little meetup sometime.

34:13.500 --> 34:14.600
- Oh, yeah.
- I would love that.

34:14.633 --> 34:16.600
- Not a playdate.
- A playdate.

34:16.633 --> 34:19.500
- I was about to say
"a playdate."

34:19.533 --> 34:21.266
I was like,
"Oh, we are adults now."

34:21.300 --> 34:23.433
- I know, you are adults. God.
- When is your birthday?

34:23.467 --> 34:25.400
- May 4.
- So, you are...

34:25.433 --> 34:26.533
- A Taurus.

34:26.567 --> 34:29.333
- A Taurus! Ah.
Okay, so she's a Gemini.

34:29.367 --> 34:30.500
- Gemini.
- So.

34:30.533 --> 34:32.266
- I think Tauruses and Gemini
get along.

34:32.300 --> 34:34.233
- I'm sure.
- I think so.

34:34.266 --> 34:37.266
- Yeah, I don't know
about that playdate.

34:37.300 --> 34:39.266
I don't know about that.

34:41.533 --> 34:43.300
All right, so what's going on
with Erika?

34:43.333 --> 34:45.567
I have to ask.
- Well, I mean...

34:45.600 --> 34:48.233
- It's grownup business,
as far as I'm concerned.

34:48.266 --> 34:51.200
- Yeah. We don't even know what
we're dealing with, you know?

34:51.233 --> 34:52.567
- I have no clue.

34:52.600 --> 34:55.500
You know, I know a little bit,
but I don't know facts.

34:55.533 --> 34:58.367
Divorce sucks, but this is,
like, worst divorce ever.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.266
It's like one
of those milkshakes

35:00.300 --> 35:03.300
that has a lot of things in it,
and they grind it up.

35:03.333 --> 35:04.467
It's real messy.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.633
I'm not gonna make any kind
of judgment

35:06.667 --> 35:09.000
without knowing real facts.
- Well, why would you?

35:09.033 --> 35:10.300
- I would never.
- Yeah.

35:26.300 --> 35:28.333
- It's cold.
- It's cold out here.

35:28.367 --> 35:30.300
You know, I've never been here.

35:30.333 --> 35:32.333
- Virtual hugs.

35:32.367 --> 35:33.667
- How are you?

35:33.700 --> 35:37.400
- I'm happy to be outside.
- I'm happy you're better.

35:37.433 --> 35:39.266
- Just being in my room
for so long

35:39.300 --> 35:40.567
was making me a little crazy.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.633
- Yeah. You go stir crazy.

35:42.667 --> 35:45.233
Girl.

35:45.266 --> 35:46.600
- How are you?
What's wrong?

35:48.667 --> 35:50.333
- Oh, my God. I feel so bad.

35:50.367 --> 35:51.667
I can't even give you
a hug right now.

35:51.700 --> 35:54.367
- It's okay.
I'm just overwhelmed, and--

35:56.266 --> 35:59.700
- Erika, I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay, Kyle.

36:03.533 --> 36:06.433
- What is going?
- Exactly. What is going on?

36:06.467 --> 36:08.266
- Well, come talk to me
before we--sit down

36:08.300 --> 36:09.633
for a minute before we walk.

36:09.667 --> 36:12.533
Oh my God, Erika. I'm not used
to seeing you like this.

36:12.567 --> 36:16.633
I'm sorry.
- Kyle, this is so hard to do.

36:16.667 --> 36:20.100
This is so hard.
What's happening is so hard.

36:20.133 --> 36:23.333
I've never been
this overwhelmed,

36:23.367 --> 36:26.367
and in a place where my hands
are literally tied.

36:26.400 --> 36:29.667
And I-I just--I mean,
I could have never predicted

36:29.700 --> 36:32.433
this-this
----ing sh--.

36:32.467 --> 36:35.433
- Ever.
- Ever.

36:40.500 --> 36:41.734
- Oh, my God, Erika.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.533
I'm not used to seeing you
like this.

36:43.567 --> 36:47.533
I'm sorry.
- Kyle, this is so hard to do.

36:47.567 --> 36:50.166
This is so hard.
What's happening is so hard.

36:50.200 --> 36:51.700
It's just--I have
such a story to tell.

36:51.734 --> 36:56.734
I can't tell it, 'cause
it--it's not the right time.

36:59.533 --> 37:01.133
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, honey.

37:01.166 --> 37:02.433
Don't cry. It's okay.

37:02.467 --> 37:04.567
- I know,
but I just feel so bad.

37:04.600 --> 37:07.700
- I've never been
this overwhelmed,

37:07.734 --> 37:11.133
and in a place where my hands
are literally tied.

37:11.166 --> 37:13.333
And I-I just--I mean,

37:13.367 --> 37:16.667
I could have never predicted
this-this ----ing sh--.

37:16.700 --> 37:18.133
- Ever.

37:18.166 --> 37:19.567
- Ever. Ever.

37:19.600 --> 37:23.333
Ever predicted that
this would be what's happening.

37:23.367 --> 37:24.767
I'm sorry. I know there's snot
coming out my nose.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.467
I don't even care anymore.

37:26.500 --> 37:29.166
- Erika.

37:31.467 --> 37:33.000
There's nothing I can do

37:33.033 --> 37:36.367
except wait
to tell my side of the story.

37:36.400 --> 37:41.467
And, you know, the feeling
of just not knowing,

37:41.500 --> 37:47.166
and then these huge things
being alleged,

37:47.200 --> 37:48.567
and just having
to defend yourself,

37:48.600 --> 37:51.200
it's just a lonely,
lonely place to be,

37:51.233 --> 37:55.367
because...

37:55.400 --> 37:58.433
God, Kyle,
my divorce is not a sham.

37:58.467 --> 38:00.200
- I know.
- It's just not.

38:00.233 --> 38:02.633
I mean, nobody wants
to be in the position

38:02.667 --> 38:06.400
I'm in right now.
It is really unenviable.

38:06.433 --> 38:11.400
Being the possible target of a
federal criminal investigation

38:11.433 --> 38:13.633
is, like, not cool.

38:14.600 --> 38:18.467
To have all those things said
about you, which are not true,

38:18.500 --> 38:24.767
and then to have everyone
basically question everything,

38:25.000 --> 38:27.500
it's lonely, and it's quiet.

38:27.533 --> 38:30.667
And you would be shocked at
how quickly people turn on you,

38:30.700 --> 38:34.767
how quickly people distance
themselves from you.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.500
Automatically,
they, you know, turn,

38:37.533 --> 38:39.400
because they don't-they
don't want to be involved.

38:39.433 --> 38:41.200
They were there
when it was good there.

38:41.233 --> 38:42.433
- Yeah.

38:42.467 --> 38:43.667
- Want to know
who your friends are?

38:43.700 --> 38:45.667
Go broke. Want to know
who your friends are?

38:45.700 --> 38:48.233
Go to jail. Want to know
who your friends are?

38:48.266 --> 38:49.767
Ask them to help you
bury a body.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.633
I don't know. You'll find out
who's there for you.

38:52.667 --> 38:55.700
I just hope someone's checking
on Tom, because he's not good.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.600
- What is happening with that?
- I don't know.

38:57.633 --> 38:59.000
- Like, have you talked
to him at all?

38:59.033 --> 39:01.533
- No. No.
No. No. No, no, no, no, no.

39:01.567 --> 39:04.033
Not since the day I left him.

39:04.066 --> 39:06.667
Tom is a proud man.

39:06.700 --> 39:09.433
One of the reasons
that I filed for divorce

39:09.467 --> 39:11.500
is the resistance to anything,

39:11.533 --> 39:13.567
the resistance
to a conversation,

39:13.600 --> 39:15.233
the resistance to,

39:15.266 --> 39:17.500
"Hey, you know, I've noticed
that you can't see well."

39:17.533 --> 39:19.000
"What are you talking about?
I'm fine."

39:19.033 --> 39:22.667
"No, you can't see well.
You can't hear.

39:22.700 --> 39:25.266
You're ----ing degrading
in front of me,

39:25.300 --> 39:27.066
and you're ignoring it."

39:30.667 --> 39:32.667
I am so sorry to unload
all of this all on you.

39:32.700 --> 39:34.734
- Erika, listen, that is
what friends are for.

39:34.767 --> 39:36.500
And we're not here for...
- This is just--

39:36.533 --> 39:38.000
- To hang out and--
- I know, we're not here

39:38.033 --> 39:39.533
for the good times,
then we're not here for just--

39:39.567 --> 39:41.700
- We're talking about people
leaving for--you know,

39:41.734 --> 39:43.300
when it's not a good time.
I'm not that friend.

39:43.333 --> 39:44.767
- I know, I know, I know.
You're not.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.033
- You can always call me,
middle of the night.

39:47.066 --> 39:48.600
- I know, but you have
your own family.

39:48.633 --> 39:50.033
- No.
- You're been sick with COVID.

39:50.066 --> 39:52.300
- I don't care.
- I just feel bad.

39:52.333 --> 39:53.433
- I don't care.

39:53.467 --> 39:55.033
And you've been
checking on me every day

39:55.066 --> 39:56.567
while I've been sick, you know?

39:56.600 --> 39:59.467
And I've been really
worried about you.

40:01.500 --> 40:03.633
I'm only asking you things that
are already out there anyway.

40:03.667 --> 40:05.033
- Go ahead and ask me anything.

40:05.066 --> 40:06.500
It doesn't matter.
I can't run from--

40:06.533 --> 40:08.033
- I'm reading this headline
that he's now asking you

40:08.066 --> 40:09.700
to pay his lawyer bills?
- Oh, yeah. That was great.

40:09.734 --> 40:11.767
Well, you know,
that's just him being

40:12.000 --> 40:13.533
a ----ing ass.

40:13.567 --> 40:17.767
- That really shocked me,
because, first of all, I mean--

40:18.000 --> 40:19.567
- First of all, how?

40:19.600 --> 40:21.100
- A, I mean...
- How?

40:21.133 --> 40:22.667
- You know, he's always
been providing for you. Yes.

40:22.700 --> 40:23.767
- That's right.
- And then you did your job.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.066
- Of course.

40:25.100 --> 40:26.500
- But you--he was
your provider--

40:26.533 --> 40:28.300
- He's always made more money
than I have.

40:28.333 --> 40:29.600
- Well, he knows
you can't perform

40:29.633 --> 40:30.767
right now, too,
with everything.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.100
- He knows everything, honey.

40:33.133 --> 40:35.333
But he's concerned
with himself first.

40:35.367 --> 40:37.066
You know, it's him first.

40:37.100 --> 40:40.734
God, I can't believe I'm gonna
----ing say this.

40:40.767 --> 40:42.333
As much as Tom encouraged me,

40:42.367 --> 40:44.533
I think he resented me
every step I took forward.

40:46.066 --> 40:47.734
Around the time of "Chicago,"

40:47.767 --> 40:50.500
Tom's view of me had changed.

40:50.533 --> 40:51.734
Like, he was like,

40:51.767 --> 40:53.500
"Who the do you think
you are?"

40:53.533 --> 40:55.100
I was like,
"What are you talking about?

40:55.133 --> 40:58.000
You-you gave me the ball.
I ran into the endzone with it.

40:58.033 --> 40:59.133
What the
are you doing?"

40:59.166 --> 41:01.033
- Well, he's also
angry you let, probably.

41:01.066 --> 41:02.633
You know,
so it's your punishment too.

41:02.667 --> 41:04.333
- Oh, he's down to punish
my ass

41:04.367 --> 41:06.000
all the way to the ground.

41:07.734 --> 41:09.000
- He has not...

41:09.033 --> 41:10.133
- He's not--
- Been an angel.

41:10.166 --> 41:12.100
- No, he's not an angel.
My God.

41:12.133 --> 41:14.667
it's--no, he's not an angel.

41:14.700 --> 41:16.066
People don't know that.

41:16.100 --> 41:17.633
They see this husband out there
who's, like,

41:17.667 --> 41:19.000
campaigning for his wife,

41:19.033 --> 41:20.600
and "she's so great"
and "she's so great."

41:22.767 --> 41:24.333
- My God.

41:24.367 --> 41:27.734
- But at home,
it wasn't that great.

41:27.767 --> 41:29.300
I didn't tell anybody

41:29.333 --> 41:32.734
because I don't think anybody
would truly understand.

41:32.767 --> 41:34.734
Because from the outside,
it looks one way.

41:37.100 --> 41:39.767
I...

41:40.000 --> 41:42.166
I'd go to hug him, and...

41:44.700 --> 41:46.767
he wouldn't hug me back.

41:50.700 --> 41:54.567
There was another life
happening.

41:56.400 --> 41:58.066
The outside...

42:00.033 --> 42:03.600
Saw a lot of support.

42:03.633 --> 42:07.667
But the inside was not.
There was a lot of conflict.

42:09.033 --> 42:10.600
- You have to be scared
for your future.

42:10.633 --> 42:11.734
Like, and then get a call--

42:11.767 --> 42:15.033
- Scared for my future?
Hell, yeah.

42:15.066 --> 42:19.200
I'm like--it's all I can do
just to wake up every day

42:19.233 --> 42:22.734
and not, you know,
want to go back to sleep,

42:22.767 --> 42:25.100
because it's just ----ed.

42:25.133 --> 42:29.700
There's no other way to say it.
I mean, it's just a disaster.

42:29.734 --> 42:31.767
- I know.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.333
- Tom is in the place
that he's in,

42:33.367 --> 42:37.100
which is his own personal hell,
and I cannot help him.

42:37.133 --> 42:39.100
I cannot help him.
And--

42:39.133 --> 42:40.400
- That must feel horrible.

42:40.433 --> 42:42.700
- Oh my God, Kyle.
- I know.

42:44.266 --> 42:46.100
I know.

42:47.700 --> 42:49.133
I remember
you saying that you--

42:49.166 --> 42:50.667
- I-I can't.
- You know, you always thought

42:50.700 --> 42:52.066
you were gonna be there
for him until the end.

42:52.100 --> 42:56.767
- Until the end.
Well, this is the end.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.166
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay, babe.

42:58.200 --> 42:59.400
- I feel so bad.
- It's okay.

42:59.433 --> 43:01.066
- No, I mean-I mean--

43:01.100 --> 43:06.100
- You know, it's not the end
that anyone ----ing wants.

43:06.133 --> 43:10.667
Because it's torture to see
someone just ----ing melt.

43:17.667 --> 43:20.633
- Next time on "The Real
Housewives of Beverly Hills":

43:23.100 --> 43:24.667
- Hello!
- Welcome!

43:24.700 --> 43:26.000
- I'm so happy to be here!

43:26.033 --> 43:27.433
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

43:27.467 --> 43:30.200
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo! This is so nice.

43:30.233 --> 43:31.700
- Where are my 15 luggages?

43:31.734 --> 43:33.200
- Do they have a man here
that can help us?

43:33.233 --> 43:34.433
Some of it's heavy.

43:34.467 --> 43:36.100
- I do not want
a big one like this.

43:36.133 --> 43:38.100
I want a big one,
but I don't want it this big.

43:40.467 --> 43:42.467
- Do we know how it went
with Tom today?

43:42.500 --> 43:44.233
- The government froze
all of his assets.

43:44.266 --> 43:46.166
- Does that mean
you can't touch your money?

43:46.200 --> 43:47.233
- No, you can't.

43:47.266 --> 43:49.166
- You can't touch it.
- No.

43:49.200 --> 43:53.033
- It's not okay, and it's not
gonna be okay for a long time.

43:53.066 --> 43:55.100
You've been married to somebody
for 20 years,

43:55.133 --> 43:57.767
and you know
that he is not mentally well.

43:59.233 --> 44:00.467
- He didn't come home,
and you're like,

44:00.500 --> 44:02.000
"Where is he?"
So you went looking for him?

44:02.033 --> 44:04.500
- I was just assuming
he was with some other woman.

44:05.533 --> 44:07.700
-
- What?
