WEBVTT

00:25.525 --> 00:27.527
[inaudible]

00:43.752 --> 00:45.754
[theme music playing]

00:53.303 --> 00:56.431
I'm not using the deaths
of 19 people for political gain.

00:56.514 --> 00:58.725
You're third in the polls.
For the next four months,

00:58.808 --> 01:00.977
every breath you take
should be for political gain.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.687
The groundbreaking ceremony is off-limits.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.981
It's not just about that one new bridge.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.526
Tomorrow we're rolling out
your entire infrastructure program,

01:08.610 --> 01:10.111
with the roads and the tunnels

01:10.195 --> 01:12.072
and all the other new shit
they can cram in there.

01:12.155 --> 01:14.741
You're rebuilding America.
It's what's going to get you elected.

01:14.824 --> 01:16.451
-So use it.
-Oh, my God, I have.

01:16.534 --> 01:18.912
At every whistle-stop and fish fry
that you've dragged me to

01:18.995 --> 01:20.330
over the last six months.

01:20.413 --> 01:23.875
Look, I promise you, tomorrow night
I will scream it from the rooftops

01:23.958 --> 01:25.085
at the fundraiser in Raleigh.

01:25.168 --> 01:28.046
But tomorrow morning I'm gonna be
the president, not the candidate.

01:28.129 --> 01:29.964
Did I mention you're third in the polls?

01:30.048 --> 01:33.343
Yes, you did. Hardly the numbers
you promised me when I hired you.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.220
You won't take money from super PACs.

01:35.303 --> 01:37.931
Correct. And I won't take money
from corporations or special interests.

01:38.014 --> 01:40.517
Moss and Porter are both taking PAC money.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.727
Porter doesn't need it.
He's a billionaire.

01:42.811 --> 01:46.815
Don't let people forget that he made
those billions polluting rivers.

01:46.898 --> 01:48.358
I've gotta get back to my day job.

01:48.441 --> 01:50.151
-Please finish your breakfast.
-I'm not finished.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.779
Did you go over my list
for the veepstakes?

01:52.862 --> 01:54.447
Lorraine, it's not a game show.

01:54.531 --> 01:57.117
And, yes, I have,
and I wasn't particularly wowed.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.536
Just keep your eyes open
at the 11 o'clock.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.955
-What 11 o'clock?
-Swing state Independents.

02:02.038 --> 02:04.124
You're not leaving without endorsements.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.501
Oh, and one other thing.

02:06.584 --> 02:10.421
I made some apparel choices for tomorrow.

02:10.505 --> 02:13.466
-You're dressing me now?
-It's all made in North Carolina.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.885
So don't forget to mention that
in your groundbreaking speech.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.762
You haven't heard a word I've said.

02:17.846 --> 02:20.306
I am not campaigning
at the ceremony tomorrow.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.350
[sighs] Oh, sweetie, this is politics.

02:22.433 --> 02:25.061
Even when you're not campaigning,
you're campaigning.

02:29.357 --> 02:32.360
-Emily, do you have a minute?
-[Emily] Senior staff meeting. So late.

02:32.443 --> 02:34.154
I know you're crazed with Infrastructure.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.281
There are a million moving parts
and it's your baby,

02:36.364 --> 02:38.908
so I knew you'd want to know.
There's a mistake with the rollout.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.994
-What?
-I'm not on it.

02:41.619 --> 02:44.455
I'm late for a meeting on my project
because I was up until 5:00 a.m.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.167
making sure every last-minute
bullshit detail on it was perfect.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.334
That's not a mistake.

02:48.918 --> 02:51.629
Do you even know about the initiative
my department funded in Fayetteville?

02:51.713 --> 02:54.424
Social innovation.
Turning liabilities into assets.

02:54.507 --> 02:58.511
To begin with, we trained and employed
50 locals deemed otherwise unemployable

02:58.595 --> 03:01.014
to haul away the debris
from the bridge, and--

03:01.097 --> 03:04.559
...followed by <i>Morning Joe,</i>
the secretary of commerce will be on CNBC.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.811
Aaron, you have your talking points
for CNBS?

03:06.895 --> 03:09.272
Strong infrastructure is vital
to national defense.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.232
[Mars] Good boy.
You'll be competing for eyeballs

03:11.316 --> 03:13.359
with the secretary of transportation...

03:13.443 --> 03:15.403
-[whispers] Em, stand up.
-Why?

03:17.864 --> 03:19.699
Were you not here
when the meeting started, Emily?

03:20.450 --> 03:22.994
Seth, can you fill her in
on the "no sitting" policy?

03:23.077 --> 03:27.707
Uh, yes. Um...
When people sit during meetings,

03:27.790 --> 03:32.045
it makes us comfortable,
and that's a bad thing.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.630
[Mars] You get lethargic,
meetings drag on and on.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.465
Standing, we are in and out.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.759
I'm trying to run
a little tighter ship here.

03:39.427 --> 03:41.221
It's attributed to Churchill.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.138
[softly] Churchill also said,

03:42.222 --> 03:43.348
"When you're going through hell,
keep going."

03:43.431 --> 03:45.850
Right. Batting cleanup.

03:45.934 --> 03:49.687
POTUS will be doing morning shows,
local affiliates from major markets,

03:49.771 --> 03:51.940
a podcast, print and <i>The Late Show. </i>

03:52.023 --> 03:55.401
By the end of the day,
we will have saturated the market.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.154
[all laughing]

04:00.406 --> 04:03.660
-I don't know how that got in here. Oh!
-[Aaron] Come on!

04:03.743 --> 04:06.537
Oh, my God,
you made a sexiest politicians list?

04:06.621 --> 04:08.373
Moving on. Please. North Carolina.

04:09.123 --> 04:11.000
Moving on. Tomorrow's ceremony.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.795
Stay alert. I don't want any surprises.

04:13.878 --> 04:16.547
Nothing knocking us off-message,
which is...

04:17.131 --> 04:19.384
"America's infrastructure is crumbling."

04:19.467 --> 04:22.512
But the president has found a way
around Congress

04:22.595 --> 04:25.598
with a trillion-dollar
public-private partnership

04:25.682 --> 04:30.061
combining federal, state,
local and private resources.

04:30.144 --> 04:32.897
This is the president's signature program

04:32.981 --> 04:38.820
and the only thing I want to hear
anyone talking about today. Thank you.

04:38.903 --> 04:41.698
One, the threat imposed
by our aging electrical grid.

04:41.781 --> 04:46.369
Two, upgrades needed to protect against
cyberattacks on critical infrastructures.

04:50.581 --> 04:51.416
Really?

04:55.336 --> 04:56.421
I can't work in here.

04:56.504 --> 04:59.716
Just have whoever did it
take this down before I get back.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.219
Mr. Shore? Mr. Shore?

05:03.845 --> 05:05.638
The Norwegian ambassador
needs to meet with you.

05:05.722 --> 05:07.765
-What about?
-Something involving the Russians.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.685
-And a mini sub.
-I can see him at three.

05:10.768 --> 05:11.894
He says if it's not handled this morning,

05:11.978 --> 05:14.105
it most likely will blow into
an international incident.

05:14.188 --> 05:15.815
Does he know it's infrastructure week?

05:15.898 --> 05:18.067
Hey, Mom, it's me.
Sorry I missed your call.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.861
Call me back. I wanna know you're okay.

05:19.944 --> 05:22.113
Dontae, you're up. What do you got?

05:22.196 --> 05:24.157
[Mars] They're ready
for your first interview.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.745
You've got me talking to everybody
but the <i>Poughkeepsie Pennysaver</i> today.

05:28.828 --> 05:29.871
Check page two.

05:30.788 --> 05:33.249
Speaking of pennies,
the private equity fund

05:33.333 --> 05:35.460
that kicked 100 billion
into Infrastructure...

05:35.543 --> 05:37.211
Our friends at VQH Capital?

05:37.295 --> 05:41.090
About a third of that came from
a consortium of Saudi businessmen.

05:41.174 --> 05:44.719
One of them, Shahid Al-Mufti,

05:44.802 --> 05:48.973
is in town with his family
and is requesting a photo with you.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.726
For $33 billion, I'll even smile.

05:54.729 --> 05:55.813
[Mars exclaims]

05:56.314 --> 05:58.274
[clears throat] I'll take care of that.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.026
-Humanely, if possible.
-Yeah.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.362
[man over video] <i>Welcome to Yoretown, </i>

06:03.446 --> 06:06.282
<i>where due to years of under-investment</i>
<i>in infrastructure,</i>

06:06.365 --> 06:08.659
<i>it's all about to fall apart.</i>

06:08.743 --> 06:10.912
Holy hell, Dontae, this is amazing.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.872
Yeah. And this is just the trailer.

06:12.955 --> 06:14.957
When you open the app,
it's like playing <i>SimCity.</i>

06:15.041 --> 06:16.667
You can cruise through your own community,

06:16.751 --> 06:19.837
tag repairs that are needed,
projects you want funded.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.589
Check out my hometown.

06:23.674 --> 06:26.052
No. No, no, no.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.262
-Well, the trailer was good.
-I'll fix it.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.389
Before tomorrow.
And make one that gets people to vote.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.934
Yeah, I could've used that on myself
last election.

06:33.434 --> 06:35.895
Wait, what? You didn't vote?

06:42.068 --> 06:43.236
Charlene, what is this?

06:43.319 --> 06:46.781
Jo just translated the article for me.
It's trash. Don't even bother.

06:48.533 --> 06:51.035
It's crazy.
There are no pictures of you in there,

06:51.119 --> 06:52.829
and it says he's available.

06:55.998 --> 06:58.126
I didn't make anyone's list today.

06:58.209 --> 06:59.627
I don't think Aaron
was interviewed for this,

06:59.710 --> 07:02.505
or had anything to do with it.
Don't kill him.

07:04.715 --> 07:07.718
POTUS made some notes.
I'd like Andrea to take another pass.

07:07.802 --> 07:10.471
I went through your mail.
You should read this letter.

07:10.555 --> 07:14.809
-Okay. Is it hate mail or fan mail?
-Just read it. Seriously. Read it.

07:14.892 --> 07:17.979
I have you doing an interview
with <i>El Diario.</i> Is 2:30 okay?

07:18.062 --> 07:20.815
That works.
Hey, I do interviews in English as well.

07:20.898 --> 07:22.400
I might have to bail on CNBS.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.527
I wouldn't recommend that.
Emily will kill you.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.697
[speaking Spanish]

07:27.780 --> 07:30.992
Nothing you say can make it
more embarrassing than it already is.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.369
How did things end between you and Emily?

07:33.453 --> 07:36.873
They didn't even start.
It was one kiss over two years ago.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.207
Was that in the article?

07:38.291 --> 07:39.709
She's been blowing me off.

07:39.792 --> 07:40.793
-It feels personal.
-[cell phone vibrating]

07:40.877 --> 07:43.129
-You're imagining it.
-Why won't she give me two seconds?

07:43.212 --> 07:45.131
She's got more important things to do.

07:47.008 --> 07:50.178
That's not what I meant.
What I'm saying is, she's crazed.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.597
She's been running point on Infrastructure
for months, and...

07:55.016 --> 07:58.186
I have to see the Norwegian ambassador.
I'll see you tonight?

07:59.353 --> 08:02.565
Your wife called three times.
Said it was about horseback riding?

08:02.648 --> 08:04.650
[sighs] Today is not the day, Lynn.

08:04.734 --> 08:07.820
Remind her that I'm up to my ass
in alligators today.

08:07.904 --> 08:12.200
But first, call GSA and tell them
to cut the bureaucratic bullshit

08:12.283 --> 08:14.785
in regards to our cheese-eater problem.

08:14.869 --> 08:17.914
I need that to be gone
before the press gets wind of it.

08:17.997 --> 08:21.375
"Mickey Mouse Operation"
is not the headline I want to see

08:21.459 --> 08:23.085
about the White House this week.

08:23.794 --> 08:24.921
Mr. Al-Mufti, thank you again.

08:25.004 --> 08:28.216
And please send my regards
to your business partners in Riyadh.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.344
-Hi. What's your name?
-Jamila.

08:31.427 --> 08:34.347
I have a daughter who's almost your age.
How old are you?

08:34.430 --> 08:35.806
Fourteen.

08:35.890 --> 08:38.059
Are you having a fun time here
with your dad?

08:38.142 --> 08:41.145
Jamila is not my daughter. She is my wife.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.438
[camera shutter clicks]

08:52.823 --> 08:54.116
[Hannah] Melissa?

08:56.035 --> 08:57.870
You're doing it again.

08:59.789 --> 09:00.748
Sorry.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.084
Did you call your dad back?

09:03.167 --> 09:05.086
When he called yesterday,
I heard you say you were busy

09:05.169 --> 09:07.004
and you'd call him back. Did you remember?

09:07.088 --> 09:10.216
I'm trying to finish my lit review
before I die of boredom.

09:10.299 --> 09:11.592
[Melissa] How do you not find
being an analyst

09:11.676 --> 09:14.011
the most fascinating job in the world?

09:14.095 --> 09:17.473
This morning, I had to come in at 4:30
to brief the briefer

09:17.557 --> 09:19.350
before he briefed the president.

09:19.433 --> 09:22.019
'Cause one my reports
made it into the PDB,

09:22.103 --> 09:24.397
and the briefer
couldn't understand half of it.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.400
You don't have a single personal thing
on your desk.

09:27.483 --> 09:30.861
You've been here six months, Hannah.
It's time to decorate.

09:32.446 --> 09:34.365
Oh, I'm not planning on staying long.

09:37.451 --> 09:38.911
It's statutory rape.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.455
Not when you're in Saudi Arabia.
At least, not when you're married.

09:41.539 --> 09:44.584
The US needs to be culturally sensitive,
Mr. President.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.294
The hell we do.
This is a human rights violation.

09:46.377 --> 09:49.297
-Now, what can I do?
-Fire the idiot that vetted them.

09:49.380 --> 09:52.133
He saw their ages and same last name,
assumed it was father-daughter.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.759
So did I. Don't fire him.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.345
-There were no press present, right?
-No, but I wish there had been.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.348
Not when you're about to roll out
your signature project.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.142
What about the reforms
the crown prince crows about?

10:01.225 --> 10:03.144
He lets women drive but won't touch this?

10:03.227 --> 10:05.855
The girl is 14.
How old was she when she got married?

10:05.938 --> 10:07.189
Thirteen.

10:08.691 --> 10:11.986
Jesus.
She's just a little older than Penny.

10:14.071 --> 10:14.905
I've gotta do something.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.700
What you need to do
is a crapload of interviews.

10:17.783 --> 10:18.868
Don't bring it up.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.787
"President Welcomes Pedophile
to the Oval Office"

10:21.871 --> 10:23.914
or "Road Construction."

10:23.998 --> 10:25.750
Which story do you think
they're gonna run with?

10:26.459 --> 10:27.793
You need to do something.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.545
But we also need
to protect Infrastructure.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.672
Let me staff it out,
see what our options are.

10:31.756 --> 10:32.673
We need to fix this.

10:32.757 --> 10:36.427
Before you start burning bridges,
metaphorical or Saudi-financed,

10:36.510 --> 10:39.764
I suggest that you discuss
strategic imperatives

10:39.847 --> 10:41.807
with your national security advisor.

10:45.436 --> 10:49.607
You are familiar with Norway's
40-year maritime border dispute

10:49.690 --> 10:51.275
with Russia in the Barents Sea?

10:51.359 --> 10:54.737
Yeah, I believe you signed a treaty
back in 2010 resolving it.

10:54.820 --> 10:58.991
Russia has aggressively launched
a new provocation in the area.

10:59.075 --> 11:03.954
Their ship, the<i> Yantar,</i> which they claim
is for oceanographic research--

11:04.038 --> 11:05.331
I can confirm it is a spy ship.

11:05.414 --> 11:09.001
It is loitering
near the Svalbard Undersea Cable System.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.796
The <i>Yantar</i> carries two submersibles

11:11.879 --> 11:15.841
that can reach the ocean floor with
the capability of cutting those cables.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.844
My government is taking this threat
very seriously.

11:18.928 --> 11:21.514
Russia wouldn't be that stupid.
Norway is a member of NATO.

11:21.597 --> 11:25.017
And an attack on one NATO member
is an attack on all.

11:25.643 --> 11:28.687
We would be within our rights
to invoke Article 5.

11:28.771 --> 11:32.191
Ambassador Haugen,
Article 5 hasn't been invoked since 9/11.

11:33.275 --> 11:34.860
Within our right.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.572
Maybe there is one way we can avoid that.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.699
NBC is set up in the Map Room.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.536
Then we'll head back to the Oval
for a sit-down with the <i>New York Times.</i>

11:43.619 --> 11:44.703
-Okay.
-Hey!

11:44.787 --> 11:47.373
Congressional swing state Independents
are getting restless.

11:47.456 --> 11:49.083
Lorraine, I know they carved out
some time for you,

11:49.166 --> 11:50.668
but the president's schedule is backed up

11:50.751 --> 11:52.378
and I have journalists
who are becoming feral.

11:52.461 --> 11:53.754
Okay, listen, newsie, I--

11:53.838 --> 11:57.174
I will speak with the Independents.
Five, ten minutes, tops.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.176
-I'll tell Lester you're on the way.
-Okay, thanks.

11:59.760 --> 12:02.096
What jammed up your schedule?
Something I should know about?

12:02.179 --> 12:04.056
-Nothing I can discuss with you.
-[Lorraine] Hmm.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.225
Mr. President, do you have a minute?

12:06.308 --> 12:08.102
Not that I'm aware of. What's going on?

12:08.185 --> 12:10.187
I heard you were talking
with the ambassador for Norway.

12:10.271 --> 12:13.649
Norway thinks the <i>Yantar</i>
is about to cut their fiber optic cables.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.276
-That's unlikely.
-No, but the <i>Yantar</i>

12:15.359 --> 12:17.278
also has the technology
to tap those wires.

12:17.361 --> 12:20.448
We have 700 troops in Norway.
What do you suggest?

12:20.531 --> 12:24.743
A nuclear sub.
Now, Russia knows the <i>USS Jimmy Carter</i>

12:24.827 --> 12:26.954
has the ability to cut or tap
fiber optic cables.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.748
We could steam her over to Syria
off the coast of Tartūs--

12:29.832 --> 12:31.792
Where Russia has
its only overseas naval base.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.211
And where we know
they have underwater cables.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.464
We just sit there, not even say a word.

12:36.547 --> 12:39.049
See how they feel about a game
of geopolitical chicken.

12:39.133 --> 12:42.094
Smart. Really smart. I'll make the call.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.138
-Lorraine, I'm sorry--
-Go be president.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.682
I'll deal with
the swing state Independents.

12:46.765 --> 12:50.394
Maybe a veepstakes contender
will just fall into my lap. [chuckles]

12:50.478 --> 12:54.231
Right. Aaron, walk with me.
I want your counsel on Saudi Arabia.

12:57.568 --> 12:58.486
[Emily] Dontae!

12:59.195 --> 13:02.114
Did I mishear you or did you say
you didn't vote in the last election?

13:02.198 --> 13:04.575
I so wanna say you misheard.

13:04.658 --> 13:06.327
How could you not vote?

13:06.410 --> 13:07.870
I can't vote for someone
I don't believe in.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.663
Then vote against the person
you don't believe in more.

13:10.414 --> 13:14.668
They both sucked. Neither addressed
the issues facing the black community.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.962
Or the LGBTQ community.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.423
Or, come to think of it,
the tech community.

13:19.507 --> 13:22.009
As your superior,
I can't ask who you're voting for,

13:22.092 --> 13:24.094
but you are voting
in this election, right?

13:24.178 --> 13:26.639
-[Carrie over video] <i>Hey, baby.</i>
-Mom, why the video chat?

13:26.722 --> 13:30.309
<i>I want to show you something. Hold on.</i>

13:31.644 --> 13:34.188
Again, I'm not asking,

13:34.271 --> 13:36.315
but you work for Kirkman.
You must believe in him.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.692
The fact that he wasn't a politician
gave me hope.

13:39.610 --> 13:41.570
I thought it was my best shot
to come in here,

13:41.654 --> 13:43.405
do my small part and help course-correct.

13:43.489 --> 13:45.908
-So you are voting.
-If he doesn't disappoint me.

13:47.576 --> 13:48.953
[Carrie] <i>What do you think?</i>

13:52.623 --> 13:55.167
-It looks great.
<i>-Thanks.</i>

13:56.418 --> 13:58.921
The American Society of Civil Engineers

13:59.004 --> 14:02.091
has given us a D+ rating
on Infrastructure.

14:02.174 --> 14:04.426
That includes everything
from roads, bridges,

14:04.510 --> 14:08.347
dams, ports, schools,
railways, water, energy--

14:08.430 --> 14:10.349
-[cell phone ringing]
-Oh. I'm sorry.

14:11.517 --> 14:15.563
They've also given us a list
of 54,000 bridges in this country

14:15.646 --> 14:17.982
that they feel are structurally unsound.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.692
Well, minus one.

14:20.359 --> 14:23.070
The bridge from Fayetteville,
North Carolina was on that list.

14:25.030 --> 14:28.784
Nineteen senseless deaths because we,
the government, couldn't come together

14:28.868 --> 14:32.580
and perform our most basic responsibility,
which is to protect its citizens.

14:32.663 --> 14:35.791
But tomorrow we start rebuilding again.
Nationwide.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.585
I am with the president.

14:38.627 --> 14:43.674
Lynn, calm down, okay? Listen to me.
Leave the store. Go home.

14:45.426 --> 14:50.014
[stutters] Okay, just do not do
anything else. I'm leaving now.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.515
Sir? Are you okay?

14:52.099 --> 14:54.643
I take it you've heard
about the latest mouse sighting.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.687
The trouble is,
the White House is a historical landmark--

14:56.770 --> 14:58.689
-I'm going off campus.
-Now?

14:58.772 --> 15:01.859
But your schedule is jammed.
Is the president aware?

15:01.942 --> 15:02.985
Yeah.

15:03.068 --> 15:06.322
When you think of some of
the iconic structures across this land...

15:06.405 --> 15:08.365
The Brooklyn Bridge,
the Golden Gate Bridge,

15:08.449 --> 15:12.870
the Hoover Dam,
imagined by visionary mavericks. Well...

15:13.787 --> 15:16.123
Do you know who gave us
our US Interstate system?

15:16.206 --> 15:17.666
-[cell phone chimes]
-No cheating.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.337
-[chuckles]
-Dwight Eisenhower, 1956.

15:22.046 --> 15:24.882
The National Interstate
and Defense Highway Act.

15:24.965 --> 15:27.426
Notice his use of the word "defense."

15:27.509 --> 15:30.721
President Eisenhower believed
it was crucial to our national security,

15:30.804 --> 15:31.639
and I agree with him.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.224
Al Jazeera is reporting
you met with a key investor

15:34.308 --> 15:38.812
in your P3 fund earlier today.
Shahid Al-Mufti. Is that true, sir?

15:39.939 --> 15:41.315
Yes, that's correct.

15:41.982 --> 15:43.817
They posted a smiling picture of you

15:43.901 --> 15:47.529
posing with Al-Mufti
and his 14-year-old wife.

15:48.155 --> 15:50.574
You condone this relationship,
Mr. President?

15:51.700 --> 15:54.495
[scoffs] No, of course I don't.

15:55.871 --> 15:58.624
I've recently learned
that in developing countries,

15:58.707 --> 16:01.919
one in three girls are married
before they reach the age of 18.

16:02.002 --> 16:03.128
Some as young as ten.

16:04.254 --> 16:05.464
I have an 11-year-old daughter

16:05.547 --> 16:07.800
and I can't imagine her
being put in that position.

16:08.550 --> 16:10.719
I think childhood marriage is barbaric.

16:11.345 --> 16:14.181
But I am told that the crown prince
is trying to reform.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.934
I can only urge him to try harder.

16:18.310 --> 16:19.895
Alimony <i>pendente lite.</i>

16:19.979 --> 16:22.189
It means "pending the litigation."

16:22.272 --> 16:24.274
Sweetie, let your attorney
handle the big words.

16:24.358 --> 16:25.818
I thought we agreed to be civil.

16:25.901 --> 16:27.903
That was before you demanded money
on top of the money

16:27.987 --> 16:30.280
that we've been arguing about
for over a year.

16:30.364 --> 16:33.617
It's temporary. The court says
the spouse making less money is--

16:33.701 --> 16:37.162
Is entitled to keep living the lifestyle
that I accustomed you to.

16:37.746 --> 16:40.874
I swear, Alan, sometimes I think
you only wanted me for my money.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.126
We're done.

16:44.294 --> 16:46.922
You know, my other two exes
didn't ask for alimony.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.216
Oh, right, they had jobs.

16:49.299 --> 16:50.634
[Alan] The judge will grant it, Lorraine.

16:50.718 --> 16:53.178
Do you have time to spend in court
fighting this?

16:53.971 --> 16:55.014
Shit.

16:56.974 --> 16:58.308
They talked to the Saudi Embassy.

16:58.392 --> 17:02.146
Crown Prince bin Zahrani
is royally pissed. Literally.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.314
[Seth over cell phone] <i>I'm aware.</i>
<i>They just released a statement.</i>

17:04.398 --> 17:08.527
"Crown Prince Ibrihim bin Zahrani
considers President Kirkman's remarks

17:08.610 --> 17:10.612
an unacceptable affront to the Kingdom."

17:10.696 --> 17:13.073
They're threatening to pull out of trade
and investment deals,

17:13.157 --> 17:16.035
threatening to expel the ambassador.
The list goes on.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.078
[Mars] <i>Pull the rest of POTUS'</i>
<i>press appearances.</i>

17:18.162 --> 17:21.373
He's gonna be stuck all day
with the Saudi ambassador.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.333
I'm sorry I really stepped in it.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.377
See what happens
when you're not around, Mars?

17:25.461 --> 17:28.589
I apologize, Mr. President.
I never should have left that room.

17:28.672 --> 17:31.550
Short of tackling me
and sticking a sock in my mouth,

17:31.633 --> 17:33.969
which the Secret Service
would have shot you for,

17:34.053 --> 17:36.597
<i>there's really nothing you could do.</i>
<i>Are you okay?</i>

17:36.680 --> 17:39.183
Yeah, I'm fine. It's Lynn, she's sick.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.727
But she's gonna be fine.
I just have to stop by the pharmacy.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.187
<i>I'll be back as soon as I can.</i>

17:43.270 --> 17:46.023
Do what you need to do.
I hope she feels better soon.

17:46.106 --> 17:47.107
Me, too.

17:51.278 --> 17:54.448
I'm not stepping aside again
until you fill my prescription.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.784
-Mrs. Harper, I can't.
-Just fill it.

17:56.867 --> 17:57.993
Is there a problem?

17:59.578 --> 18:01.747
He's refusing to fill my prescription.

18:02.414 --> 18:03.791
It's a legitimate script.

18:03.874 --> 18:06.210
She has chronic pain from a spinal injury.

18:06.293 --> 18:08.962
I'll be happy to fill it in five days,
when it's due.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.216
Lynn, I'm sorry. I should have counted.

18:12.966 --> 18:15.511
I called you three times
before I came here.

18:15.594 --> 18:16.804
You didn't call back.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.266
-You couldn't have picked a worse day.
-I didn't pick it.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.726
I'm in pain.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.978
Is there something
you can give her in the interim?

18:25.062 --> 18:27.689
-Something other than fentanyl.
-Nothing else works.

18:29.149 --> 18:31.276
-Okay, Lynn, we have to go now.
-No.

18:31.360 --> 18:35.030
Lynn... Excuse me. Lynn, we need to go.

18:36.031 --> 18:39.409
Fucking cell phone cameras.
She'll sell it to TMZ.

18:40.160 --> 18:41.787
[Tom] Princess Zahrani, welcome.

18:41.870 --> 18:44.081
Thank you for receiving me, Mr. President.

18:44.164 --> 18:45.207
Please.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.836
I'm here in my capacity
as Counselor of the Embassy

18:48.919 --> 18:50.129
of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.755
Please, call me Rania.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.049
I have to be honest. I was very surprised

18:54.133 --> 18:57.761
when I was told that Ambassador Alawi
was sending you in his place.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.347
Surprised that Saudi Arabia
allows women to work at all?

19:00.430 --> 19:02.349
I assure you I'm not that ill-informed.

19:02.432 --> 19:04.810
I was sent to find out
how informed you are.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.772
[Emily] So, make it clear that Al-Mufti
is not the private equity fund.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.149
He's just a part of a part of it.

19:10.232 --> 19:13.110
And the private equity fund itself
is just part of the infrastructure fund.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.654
Which makes him
a part of a part of a part of it.

19:15.737 --> 19:16.655
That's not gonna matter.

19:16.738 --> 19:19.825
Just do whatever you can
to move them past Saudi Arabia.

19:19.908 --> 19:21.827
In Saudi Arabia,
women are also allowed to attend school.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.787
Yes, with the permission of a man.

19:23.871 --> 19:27.040
The crown prince is actively scaling back
the guardianship system.

19:27.124 --> 19:28.792
When I enrolled
in George Washington University,

19:28.876 --> 19:29.960
I required no man's permission.

19:30.043 --> 19:32.880
With all due respect,
you're the crown prince's cousin.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.882
Do you know how many members
of the royal family there are?

19:34.965 --> 19:37.968
-Off the top of my head, no.
-Fifteen thousand.

19:38.051 --> 19:40.387
There are many issues
on which our countries diverge,

19:40.470 --> 19:43.849
and we both understand
the ties that bind us together.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.809
What can we do to fix this?

19:45.893 --> 19:48.520
Do you have any idea how much harder
you've made it for my cousin

19:48.604 --> 19:50.564
to get reforms past the hardliners?

19:50.647 --> 19:53.609
Anything he does now will look like
he's doing America's bidding.

19:53.692 --> 19:54.943
I'm not sure if it is fixable.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.865
I need you to jump on damage control.

19:59.948 --> 20:01.033
[Aaron over cell phone]
<i>I'm on my way to Pebble Beach.</i>

20:01.116 --> 20:03.535
I assume I'm not talking about
infrastructure anymore, right?

20:03.619 --> 20:04.912
Change of plans.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.414
I need you to restore peace
in the Middle East.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.126
I'm very sorry for what I said publicly.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.587
I should have shared my concerns
with the crown prince himself.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.797
Because it is up to
the morally superior America

20:15.881 --> 20:17.674
to teach the rest of the world how to act.

20:17.758 --> 20:20.719
No, because I believe every young girl
has a right to a childhood.

20:20.802 --> 20:23.347
Al-Mufti does not work
for the sovereign wealth fund.

20:23.430 --> 20:25.891
The Kingdom would never have sent a man
with an underaged wife.

20:25.974 --> 20:28.518
Because the optics would've been bad,
not because it doesn't exist.

20:29.102 --> 20:30.520
Where's my pen?

20:43.700 --> 20:45.661
Seth, I'm gonna watch the briefing.

20:51.083 --> 20:54.044
Child marriage is now uncommon
in our cities.

20:54.127 --> 20:57.506
It exists, but in places
where change takes longer to reach.

20:57.589 --> 21:01.385
Rural areas under tribal chiefs,
adherents of extreme clerics.

21:01.468 --> 21:04.054
Just because those girls are out of sight
doesn't mean they don't matter.

21:05.138 --> 21:08.892
Please, tell me. What else do you assume
is wrong with Saudi Arabia?

21:09.476 --> 21:11.645
I try not to assume,
so I'll tell you what I know.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.941
Fifteen of the 19 hijackers from 9/11
were Saudi nationals.

21:16.024 --> 21:19.653
Your religious police would prefer to
watch girls burn to death in their school

21:19.736 --> 21:21.196
than leave it without their burqas on.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.408
You persecute religious minorities,
female activists.

21:24.491 --> 21:26.827
You have no free press,
a long history of torture.

21:26.910 --> 21:29.037
And you murder journalists
that speak out against you.

21:30.539 --> 21:32.124
You know a little about us,

21:33.125 --> 21:35.711
-but we know so much more about you.
-Such as?

21:35.794 --> 21:37.796
We know your country was founded
as a slave state.

21:37.879 --> 21:39.923
Your incarceration rate
is the highest in the world.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.134
You're less than 5%
of the world's population,

21:42.217 --> 21:44.761
yet you house 22%
of the world's criminals.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.555
You give prison sentences
for smoking marijuana,

21:46.638 --> 21:48.473
but not for billion-dollar fraud.

21:49.725 --> 21:53.145
"Let he who is without sin
cast the first stone." Point taken.

21:53.228 --> 21:54.438
I'm just getting started.

21:55.605 --> 21:58.275
[Aaron over TV]<i> Saudi Arabia is</i>
<i>the linchpin of the Middle East.</i>

21:58.358 --> 22:00.027
<i>It's the key to its stability.</i>

22:00.110 --> 22:02.529
<i>They help fight al-Qaeda and ISIS</i>
<i>in the region.</i>

22:02.612 --> 22:05.157
<i>They've stopped numerous terrorist plots</i>
<i>against America.</i>

22:05.240 --> 22:08.910
<i>The truth is, we're safer because of</i>
<i>our relationship with Saudi Arabia.</i>

22:08.994 --> 22:10.537
Your murder rate is astronomical.

22:10.620 --> 22:12.289
Of all the civilian-owned handguns
in the world,

22:12.372 --> 22:13.415
Americans own nearly half.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.751
You call yourself
the greatest country in the world,

22:15.834 --> 22:18.587
yet you allow 500,000 of your people
to go homeless,

22:18.670 --> 22:20.088
millions to go without health care.

22:21.214 --> 22:23.717
As an American,
these are things I am not proud of.

22:23.800 --> 22:27.012
The president will always stand up
for humanistic values. Claire.

22:27.095 --> 22:29.097
Where does President Kirkman stand
on child marriage?

22:29.181 --> 22:32.434
The president was unaware
of Shahid Al-Mufti's marital status.

22:33.393 --> 22:37.022
Before you rain righteous indignation
on us for allowing child marriage,

22:37.105 --> 22:38.231
look in your backyard.

22:38.315 --> 22:39.441
Excuse me?

22:39.524 --> 22:42.527
Let me clarify. Where does he stand
on child marriage in the US?

22:42.611 --> 22:43.487
I don't follow.

22:43.570 --> 22:46.156
You're aware America
also allows children to marry?

22:46.239 --> 22:49.493
That's not true. Go ahead and check
the statutes in all 50 states.

22:49.576 --> 22:53.538
The minimum age at which people can
get married by law in this country is 18,

22:53.622 --> 22:57.084
18 being the age at which
you're no longer considered a minor.

22:57.167 --> 22:58.376
Ergo, no child marriage.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.378
-What about loopholes?
-What loopholes?

23:00.462 --> 23:03.465
Forty-eight states have loopholes
allowing minors to marry...

23:03.548 --> 23:06.384
16 and 17-year-olds
with parental permission.

23:06.468 --> 23:09.054
Children 15 and younger
require a judge's approval,

23:09.137 --> 23:10.806
which is routinely granted.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.265
I'll get back to you on that.

23:12.349 --> 23:15.185
So, the president is against
child marriage in other countries,

23:15.268 --> 23:16.561
but fine with it here?

23:18.438 --> 23:19.856
<i>I can't speak with authority</i>

23:19.940 --> 23:22.567
<i>to issues outside the purview</i>
<i>of the National Security Council,</i>

23:22.651 --> 23:26.530
<i>but what I can unequivocally vouch for</i>
<i>is President Kirkman's character.</i>

23:26.613 --> 23:28.573
<i>Hypocrisy is not in his DNA.</i>

23:28.657 --> 23:33.036
<i>If there's an injustice involved, he'll do</i>
<i>everything within his power to right it.</i>

23:33.120 --> 23:34.788
[Philip] <i>I have a question</i>
<i>about the president's trip</i>

23:34.871 --> 23:35.956
<i>to North Carolina tomorrow.</i>

23:36.039 --> 23:37.457
<i>Yes, Phil. What would you like to know? </i>

23:37.541 --> 23:38.500
[Philip] <i>Is the president aware</i>

23:38.583 --> 23:41.419
<i>that North Carolina allows children</i>
<i>as young as 14</i>

23:41.503 --> 23:44.381
<i>to obtain a marriage license</i>
<i>in the case of childbirth or pregnancy? </i>

23:45.173 --> 23:47.968
Get everyone in here now. Thank you.

23:48.051 --> 23:50.637
[Seth] <i>Are there any other questions</i>
<i>on any other topic?</i>

23:51.429 --> 23:53.932
In my daily lit review
on synthetic biology,

23:54.015 --> 23:57.102
which normally bores the tits off of me,

23:57.185 --> 24:01.690
I found a biogeneticist who sequenced
the entire genome of the poppy.

24:02.774 --> 24:06.153
I'm really happy you're finally enjoying
your work in Analysis.

24:06.236 --> 24:07.404
It's where I started.

24:07.487 --> 24:11.741
The poppy as in opium poppy,
as in grown in Afghanistan.

24:11.825 --> 24:14.161
Makes heroin that funds terrorism.

24:15.912 --> 24:17.581
Now that it's sequenced,

24:17.664 --> 24:21.501
our guys can go in and use CRISPR
to splice and edit this genome

24:21.585 --> 24:23.378
and wipe out their entire fucking crop.

24:23.461 --> 24:28.341
This biogeneticist, is he one of ours?
DARPA? CDC?

24:28.425 --> 24:31.428
Dr. Eli Mays.
This guy crowdsourced from a DIY bio lab.

24:31.511 --> 24:32.679
A biohacker.

24:32.762 --> 24:34.639
We need to make contact
before an unfriendly does.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.684
This is very good work, Hannah.
Put it in your daily report.

24:37.767 --> 24:40.478
Give it to your supervisor.
They'll be very impressed.

24:41.563 --> 24:44.316
Dianne, I don't want to just write it up.

24:44.399 --> 24:46.276
I discovered him. He should be mine.

24:47.068 --> 24:50.405
Hannah, do you have
a life outside of work?

24:50.488 --> 24:51.323
[Hannah scoffs]

24:52.407 --> 24:56.369
-What does this have to with--
-You know, hobbies, human interactions?

24:56.453 --> 24:58.830
There's a dog park I go to on the weekend.

24:58.914 --> 25:01.458
-Oh, you have a dog?
-No.

25:01.541 --> 25:04.419
Dianne, put me in Operations.

25:04.502 --> 25:07.130
But you're just hitting your stride
in Analysis.

25:07.214 --> 25:10.467
I know you didn't just recruit me
to sit behind a desk.

25:10.550 --> 25:12.135
This has been a test, right?

25:12.219 --> 25:15.764
To punish me or break me.
Mission accomplished.

25:15.847 --> 25:18.266
I've been in hell for six months.
I've been good.

25:18.350 --> 25:21.102
And if I don't get out,
I'm gonna kill Melissa.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.270
You're right.

25:23.146 --> 25:24.147
We sheep-dipped you.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.567
The CIA is not law enforcement.

25:28.276 --> 25:31.029
We are intelligence gatherers. No gun.

25:31.821 --> 25:33.323
You're moving me to Operations?

25:35.951 --> 25:37.118
You will not regret it.

25:41.665 --> 25:44.125
-I just wanted to let you know--
-Not now, Isabel.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.169
We're in the middle of a clusterfuck.
I'm on my way to see POTUS.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.671
This isn't about my initiative--

25:47.754 --> 25:48.964
Give it a break already.

25:49.047 --> 25:51.132
I know how badly you want
a seat at the big kids' table.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.717
I've been there. I get it.

25:52.801 --> 25:55.262
I'm all about mentoring women,
and I will do whatever I can for you.

25:55.345 --> 25:56.513
But it's not happening today.

25:56.596 --> 25:59.683
The NGO I was with,
we worked with child brides in Mozambique.

26:04.062 --> 26:06.439
From the year 2000 to the year 2015,

26:06.523 --> 26:09.359
there were over 200,000 child marriages
in this country.

26:09.442 --> 26:10.944
How was that not on our radar?

26:11.027 --> 26:13.613
So, after getting javelins thrown at me
the entire briefing,

26:13.697 --> 26:14.864
I had my team look into this.

26:14.948 --> 26:19.577
They found it in every state, every race,
across all socioeconomic data.

26:19.661 --> 26:23.707
It's common in poor and rural communities
and conservative religious groups.

26:23.790 --> 26:26.584
Christian, Orthodox Jewish,
Muslim, Mormon.

26:26.668 --> 26:27.919
My team ran numbers as well.

26:28.003 --> 26:32.090
Of the 200,000 child marriages
you mentioned, over two-thirds were 17.

26:32.173 --> 26:33.091
Still a minor.

26:33.174 --> 26:36.428
985 of them were 14,
and ten of them were only 12 years old.

26:36.511 --> 26:39.389
This is a human rights violation.
I want it stopped.

26:39.472 --> 26:41.558
Can I sign an executive order banning it?

26:41.641 --> 26:43.435
-It's a states' rights issue.
-[Emily] What's the issue?

26:43.518 --> 26:46.354
Marriage is legislated by the states.
Why aren't they fixing it?

26:46.438 --> 26:49.274
Freedom of religion, for one.
Premarital sex is a sin.

26:49.357 --> 26:51.359
You want the kids married
before they start having it.

26:51.443 --> 26:54.321
When an underaged girl gets pregnant,
many people believe

26:54.404 --> 26:57.282
the child is better off
if the parents are married.

26:57.365 --> 26:59.409
Even if the mother is a child herself.

26:59.492 --> 27:02.954
It's still not right. The law states
you are a minor until you are 18.

27:03.038 --> 27:05.290
We're a country
that protects its children.

27:05.373 --> 27:07.208
We've got laws that do that.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.544
We prevent them
from drinking, smoking, gambling.

27:09.627 --> 27:11.463
Minors aren't allowed to vote,
open a bank account.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.381
-Rent an apartment.
-Rent a car.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.425
-Buy fireworks.
-Sign a contract.

27:15.508 --> 27:18.595
They can't hire an attorney,
which they would need to get a divorce.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.889
So what do we do
to get the states to ban it?

27:20.972 --> 27:23.099
You can't draw a hard line at 18.

27:23.183 --> 27:24.893
I'm sorry, who are you?

27:24.976 --> 27:29.022
Isabel Pardo, director of
your Office of Social Innovation.

27:29.105 --> 27:30.899
It's an honor to meet you, Mr. President.

27:30.982 --> 27:34.527
Isabel, why don't you explain to me
why you are pro-child marriage?

27:34.611 --> 27:38.239
I'm not. Banning it was one
of the first initiatives I proposed.

27:38.323 --> 27:39.491
So, what happened?

27:39.574 --> 27:42.035
A fight from the right,
which I was prepared for.

27:42.118 --> 27:44.412
What I didn't see coming
was equal opposition from the left.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.164
Who on the left was against it?

27:46.247 --> 27:49.376
The ACLU believes marriage
is a fundamental right.

27:49.459 --> 27:51.795
Planned Parenthood fears
the ban is a slippery slope.

27:51.878 --> 27:54.381
I am so tired of
the slippery-slope argument,

27:54.464 --> 27:56.132
especially when it comes to legislation.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.717
Laws are specific.

27:58.551 --> 28:02.222
Banning child marriage wouldn't do
anything to abortion or anything else.

28:02.889 --> 28:04.891
But you still think I should do nothing.

28:04.974 --> 28:07.811
No, I think you should address
the root causes.

28:07.894 --> 28:08.728
Which are?

28:08.812 --> 28:12.482
Many girls that get pregnant are coerced
into getting married by their parents.

28:12.565 --> 28:13.942
Address teen pregnancy.

28:14.025 --> 28:17.445
Mandate that all public schools offer
sex education and access to condoms.

28:17.529 --> 28:18.571
Good luck on that one.

28:18.655 --> 28:22.200
Condoms and classes aren't enough.
We need an outright ban.

28:22.283 --> 28:23.993
If you're looking for an easy answer,
there isn't one.

28:24.077 --> 28:25.328
There is. Pass a law.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.997
Are you still planning
to travel to North Carolina?

28:28.081 --> 28:32.252
Yes, I am. And in my opening comments,
I will tell the American people

28:32.335 --> 28:34.671
that I plan to sign an executive order

28:34.754 --> 28:38.091
that target the root causes
of child marriage. Thank you.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.389
-[Hannah] Dr. Mays?
-[Eli] Hold on.

28:44.472 --> 28:47.726
I'm trying to prevent the complete
deforestation of Indonesia

28:47.809 --> 28:50.687
by increasing the genetic expression
of algae to produce palm oil.

28:51.271 --> 28:55.817
Tribonema, Ulothrix and euglena
have the best potential so far.

28:55.900 --> 28:56.985
[Hannah] I'm Hannah Wells--

28:57.068 --> 29:00.989
I'm also genetically experimenting
with a cure for gray hair.

29:01.656 --> 29:03.742
How would you like to come help the CIA?

29:04.534 --> 29:05.660
Hard pass.

29:06.494 --> 29:09.080
-Why?
-I'm a biohacker.

29:09.164 --> 29:11.499
We're about the democratization
of science.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.918
-The CIA is not.
-[Hannah] For a reason.

29:14.002 --> 29:16.087
Bioengineering in the right hands, great.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.964
-In the wrong hands--
-Exactly.

29:18.673 --> 29:22.886
You know gene editing is listed
as a weapon of mass destruction, right?

29:24.387 --> 29:27.223
You guys aren't focused nearly enough
on bioterror.

29:28.767 --> 29:32.479
-That's what I've been working on--
-Mutually-assured destruction is passé.

29:32.562 --> 29:35.565
Now it's a biorogues' world.

29:35.648 --> 29:39.736
The Biological Weapons Convention
isn't enforceable or even verifiable.

29:39.819 --> 29:43.573
If you don't hold people to account,
shit will happen.

29:44.657 --> 29:46.451
You need to be monitoring everyone.

29:46.534 --> 29:49.037
-Like I do.
-How do you monitor everyone?

29:49.120 --> 29:52.582
For one, I attend bioterror conferences
all over the world.

29:53.458 --> 29:56.085
I give talks on things
that keep me up at night.

29:56.169 --> 29:57.295
Like what?

29:57.378 --> 30:01.674
How easy it's about to become
to make biological weapons on our phones.

30:03.176 --> 30:06.471
They'll soon have the capability
of becoming nanotech assemblers.

30:06.554 --> 30:10.558
And when they do, there will be sequences
you can print from your phone

30:10.642 --> 30:13.561
that can probably
cause civilization to crash.

30:13.645 --> 30:18.650
And someone, either intentionally
or accidentally, is going to do it.

30:21.653 --> 30:25.490
And without intervention,
we're all ultimately screwed.

30:26.574 --> 30:27.700
What worries you most?

30:28.785 --> 30:30.036
At this moment?

30:41.005 --> 30:42.048
This.

30:43.216 --> 30:46.386
Hundreds of them fell from the sky
in Florida a few months back.

30:46.469 --> 30:48.721
They died from a virus
I've never seen before.

30:49.347 --> 30:51.349
I believe it was genetically engineered.

30:51.432 --> 30:52.809
For what purpose?

30:52.892 --> 30:54.936
That's another thing
that keeps me up at night.

30:57.814 --> 31:00.441
Well, who should we be talking to?

31:00.525 --> 31:02.569
I assume that was a royal "we."

31:03.319 --> 31:05.196
Remember that hard pass?

31:05.280 --> 31:09.534
You just said that the CIA isn't
doing enough to monitor bioterror,

31:09.617 --> 31:10.952
so help us.

31:15.748 --> 31:19.586
I know a biohacker with a lab near MIT

31:19.669 --> 31:22.422
who was experimenting with avian viruses.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.716
Nolan Fein.

31:26.009 --> 31:28.219
He's not fed-friendly.

31:29.804 --> 31:32.348
It's a good thing you're gonna be there
to make the introduction.

31:35.393 --> 31:37.145
Dontae, thank you so much
for fixing that app.

31:37.228 --> 31:40.356
-I will check it out tomorrow.
-That's still being re-beta tested.

31:40.440 --> 31:41.900
-You gotta look at this.
-What is it?

31:41.983 --> 31:43.860
-The answer to your question.
-What question?

31:43.943 --> 31:45.945
Why people don't vote. I thought I knew.

31:46.029 --> 31:48.781
I mean, I know why some people
in my community don't.

31:48.865 --> 31:50.241
But I never knew this.

31:50.325 --> 31:52.869
Ten hours ago, you couldn't have been
more laissez-faire about this.

31:52.952 --> 31:54.245
What has gotten into you?

31:55.747 --> 31:56.789
This.

31:57.624 --> 32:00.710
46% of eligible voters didn't vote
in the last election.

32:00.793 --> 32:02.503
This is the key to why.

32:02.587 --> 32:05.673
If Kirkman can get these people, he wins.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.051
-Hey, are you gettin' out of here?
-Yes.

32:08.635 --> 32:10.845
Just watch it.

32:12.847 --> 32:16.726
Dontae, can you find me someone
talking about child marriage?

32:16.809 --> 32:18.561
Everyone's talking about
child marriage today.

32:19.187 --> 32:22.273
No, no, no. I mean somebody who is
or was a child bride.

32:24.442 --> 32:25.318
Yeah.

32:28.821 --> 32:30.073
You wanna grab a drink?

32:30.156 --> 32:32.784
No, wait, nevermind.
The flight is so early tomorrow.

32:34.661 --> 32:37.246
-Is something going on with you?
-No, I'm good.

32:37.330 --> 32:38.957
You've been distracted all day.

32:40.708 --> 32:41.876
Oh, my God.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.254
Did you see Aaron's face
when that came up on the screen?

32:45.338 --> 32:46.547
-He was mortified.
-Yeah.

32:46.631 --> 32:48.841
A public shaming for being singled out

32:48.925 --> 32:51.803
as one of the sexiest politicians
in the world. I'd be mortified.

32:51.886 --> 32:54.555
Well, I don't think he likes
being objectified.

32:54.639 --> 32:58.601
I mean, it diminishes his intellect
and his actual accomplishments.

32:58.685 --> 33:01.896
Oh, come on. Do you have any idea
what that does for a guy's dating life?

33:01.980 --> 33:03.690
It's a waste. He's off the market.

33:03.773 --> 33:05.358
It's that serious with Isabel?

33:05.441 --> 33:08.361
Well, word around the office is
they're moving in together.

33:09.404 --> 33:10.571
How's your mom?

33:10.655 --> 33:12.156
She's good. Really good, considering.

33:12.240 --> 33:15.743
I haven't really been talking to her
as often as I should be, but--

33:15.827 --> 33:18.037
-I have a kid.
-What?

33:19.330 --> 33:22.417
How? I mean, I know how, but how?

33:22.500 --> 33:23.501
You don't know how.

33:24.335 --> 33:26.921
Um, when I was a freshman at Harvard...

33:28.423 --> 33:29.799
I sold my sperm.

33:29.882 --> 33:31.009
No.

33:31.092 --> 33:34.220
It was easy money.
I never gave it a second thought.

33:35.722 --> 33:39.183
Her name is Stephanie Kapoor.
She's 21 years old.

33:40.101 --> 33:43.021
-I'm kinda freaking out about it.
-How did she find you?

33:43.104 --> 33:44.897
Remember when I was looking
for my birth parents?

33:44.981 --> 33:46.482
My DNA is on 23andMe.

33:46.566 --> 33:49.485
Well, didn't you consider the consequences
when you were...

33:49.569 --> 33:51.696
Ejaculating into a cup for money?
No, not really.

33:51.779 --> 33:55.033
Back then, the technology didn't exist.
This wasn't a possibility.

33:55.616 --> 33:57.160
So when are you meeting her?

33:57.243 --> 33:59.037
Would I be a terrible person
if I said never?

33:59.120 --> 34:02.290
Yes, you would be
a terrible, terrible person.

34:02.373 --> 34:05.001
If she wants to meet you,
you owe her that.

34:05.084 --> 34:06.544
I do need that drink.

34:08.379 --> 34:09.255
[Aaron] Hey, hon?

34:09.338 --> 34:11.299
-Yes, <i>mi amor?</i>
-What is this?

34:11.883 --> 34:13.342
Exercise equipment.

34:14.927 --> 34:18.097
Did I mention how impressed
the president was with you today?

34:18.181 --> 34:19.348
[Isabel] Yes, you did.

34:21.684 --> 34:23.227
And how much I love you?

34:26.647 --> 34:28.066
I love you, too.

34:29.525 --> 34:33.863
[sighs] I had a big win today.
It feels so good.

34:33.946 --> 34:35.531
The president of the United States

34:35.615 --> 34:39.285
is about to sign an executive order
on your advice.

34:39.368 --> 34:41.621
You can't say they don't pay attention
to you anymore.

34:41.704 --> 34:42.538
[chuckles]

34:42.622 --> 34:46.250
Vice President Isabel Pardo,
it kinda has a nice ring to it, right?

34:47.251 --> 34:49.545
Yeah, that ain't happenin'.

34:50.463 --> 34:53.508
But I do get to sleep
with <i>"El político más guapo."</i>

34:53.591 --> 34:54.425
[Aaron] Yeah?

34:55.009 --> 34:58.971
-[Isabel exclaims and chuckles]
-Well, it would be very disrespectful

34:59.764 --> 35:01.891
for you to sleep with
the prime minister of Canada tonight.

35:01.974 --> 35:03.226
You just moved in.

35:04.310 --> 35:05.603
[laughing]

35:06.270 --> 35:09.565
[Tom] Don't take it easy on me
just 'cause I'm the president now.

35:09.649 --> 35:12.276
[Penny] Lucky for you, body checking
is a penalty in my league.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.778
[Tom] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

35:13.861 --> 35:16.197
Your brother Leo
finally called me back yesterday.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.698
He wanted me to tell you "yo."

35:17.782 --> 35:19.200
[Penny chuckles] Can you flunk out
of summer school?

35:19.283 --> 35:22.286
[Tom] Leo's doing just fine.
Keep your head up and eyes forward.

35:22.829 --> 35:25.748
-Hey! [exclaims]
-[both chuckle]

35:26.541 --> 35:28.876
[sighs] Nice check.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.461
[both panting]

35:30.545 --> 35:31.921
You know, I was thinking...

35:32.588 --> 35:35.842
If anyone ever messed with you,
made you feel uncomfortable,

35:35.925 --> 35:36.926
you'd tell me, wouldn't you?

35:37.009 --> 35:40.972
How can anyone mess with me?
I have 24-hour protection.

35:41.055 --> 35:42.723
[chuckles] Yeah, right.

35:44.100 --> 35:46.227
Is this about the whole child bride thing?

35:47.270 --> 35:49.647
Everyone was talking about it at day camp.

35:49.730 --> 35:51.440
It's super creepy.

35:51.524 --> 35:52.733
Yes, it is.

35:54.110 --> 35:56.154
There should be a law against it.

35:57.071 --> 35:58.573
You're absolutely right.

36:00.533 --> 36:03.536
-Executive order is not enough.
-What?

36:04.328 --> 36:07.790
I'm gonna do everything I can
to help pass that law.

36:07.874 --> 36:10.626
You're gonna have to be 18 years old
to get married in this country.

36:10.710 --> 36:13.629
Now, come on. Back on your skates.
We're not done.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.132
There. You ready?

36:18.968 --> 36:21.804
You know what we haven't done
since I started this job?

36:22.972 --> 36:26.100
We haven't taken one single vacation.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.521
Let's plan one for next month.

36:31.230 --> 36:33.107
Anywhere you wanna go, your choice.

36:34.692 --> 36:37.028
It'll be August recess.

36:38.154 --> 36:39.906
It's as slow as DC gets.

36:41.365 --> 36:44.744
I can take a week, maybe even ten days.

36:48.539 --> 36:50.666
What about St. Simons Island?

36:52.084 --> 36:55.004
You always loved it there at St. Simons.
What do you say?

36:56.964 --> 36:58.174
That'll be nice.

37:09.393 --> 37:10.603
[exhales heavily]

37:12.146 --> 37:13.648
I'm back.

37:18.277 --> 37:20.279
Pop the trunk.
You don't have to walk me in.

37:20.363 --> 37:22.949
What are you talking about?
Of course I'm going to walk you in.

37:23.032 --> 37:24.033
Hey...

37:26.911 --> 37:30.915
I am so proud of you.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.210
Doing this for yourself.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.964
I'm not doing this for myself.

37:40.299 --> 37:42.218
You're making me do this for you.

37:49.767 --> 37:51.310
See you in 28 days.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.195
"When the goal is the greater good,

38:01.279 --> 38:05.032
people from all levels of government
can work together to achieve it."

38:05.116 --> 38:08.035
Why aren't you wearing
any of the clothes I brought you?

38:08.119 --> 38:10.663
-They weren't me.
-It was the North Carolina you.

38:10.746 --> 38:12.957
We need to lock down his remarks
for the groundbreaking

38:13.040 --> 38:14.375
-and then he's all yours.
-Fine.

38:14.458 --> 38:15.501
[Tom] "It is in this spirit that I plan

38:15.584 --> 38:17.920
to introduce legislation
to ban child marriage,

38:18.004 --> 38:20.589
establish federal law
that makes 18 the minimum age--"

38:20.673 --> 38:24.051
-No, you can't say that.
-Why not?

38:24.135 --> 38:26.053
States' rights, religious rights,
parental rights.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.681
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Saving abused children.

38:28.764 --> 38:30.308
How can you possibly
have a problem with that?

38:30.391 --> 38:32.476
-Because it'll cost him the election!
-[Emily] That's insane.

38:32.560 --> 38:33.561
I have polling data that says

38:33.644 --> 38:36.063
a hell of a lot more people are
against child marriage than for it.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.648
[Lorraine] That data
doesn't mean anything.

38:37.732 --> 38:39.984
The people that are against it,
it's not an issue they vote on.

38:40.067 --> 38:42.028
But the people who don't want the ban,

38:42.111 --> 38:44.155
the people who are
personally affected by it,

38:44.238 --> 38:46.699
you can bet your ass
that every single one of them

38:46.782 --> 38:48.451
will show up to vote against you.

38:48.534 --> 38:51.037
-It's the right thing to do.
-This is a knee-jerk reaction.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.872
You're doing this out of embarrassment.

38:52.955 --> 38:55.374
She could give a shit about child brides.
They aren't old enough to vote.

38:55.458 --> 38:58.753
Please don't shoot yourself in the dick.
It's pointless.

38:58.836 --> 39:00.171
Congress won't even take this up.

39:00.254 --> 39:04.467
You have the power and the platform
to help these girls.

39:04.550 --> 39:06.510
Child brides are less likely
to stay in school,

39:06.594 --> 39:08.721
more likely to experience
domestic violence.

39:08.804 --> 39:10.931
They're 31% more likely
to end up in poverty.

39:11.015 --> 39:12.850
The majority of them end up in divorce.

39:12.933 --> 39:16.354
Introducing legislation
that you cannot possibly push through,

39:16.437 --> 39:18.564
it gets you nothing
and costs you everything.

39:18.647 --> 39:20.566
Do you wanna win or not?

39:21.942 --> 39:23.319
Seth, what do you think?

39:25.237 --> 39:27.531
-They're both right.
-[whispering] Pussy.

39:28.449 --> 39:29.658
Dontae found me this woman.

39:29.742 --> 39:30.868
[typing]

39:33.579 --> 39:34.955
Watch it before you decide.

39:45.007 --> 39:48.636
[woman over video] <i>That was me,</i>
<i>the school year prior to marriage.</i>

39:49.178 --> 39:51.555
<i>At 13, I was sexually assaulted.</i>

39:51.639 --> 39:55.226
<i>As the upcoming school year started,</i>

39:55.309 --> 39:57.686
<i>then I found out that I was pregnant.</i>

39:58.312 --> 40:03.401
<i>And, given the religious community,</i>
<i>I had to marry this person.</i>

40:03.484 --> 40:07.321
<i>When my daughter was two,</i>
<i>he became abusive to her.</i>

40:07.405 --> 40:10.908
<i>And so I grabbed her and ran</i>
<i>to get away from him.</i>

40:10.991 --> 40:15.538
<i>And I would knock on somebody's door,</i>
<i>and nobody would let me in.</i>

40:17.832 --> 40:19.708
[crying] <i>And I'd hide in the creek...</i>

40:22.962 --> 40:24.547
<i>holding my baby.</i>

40:28.592 --> 40:32.304
Good news on the you-know-what.
The exterminator showed up and got it.

40:32.388 --> 40:35.266
Well done, Felix. Your future's looking
markedly brighter.

40:35.349 --> 40:36.684
And now the bad news.

40:36.767 --> 40:39.311
Is there a law that good news
has to come with bad?

40:39.395 --> 40:41.647
The exterminator located the hole
where the mouse got in.

40:41.730 --> 40:43.941
The hole was caused by termites.

40:44.024 --> 40:47.653
-We are not tenting the White House.
-I'll look into options.

40:49.238 --> 40:51.615
-[crowd applauding]
-[Tom] <i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

40:51.699 --> 40:54.160
I wish we could've brought you
better weather.

40:54.243 --> 40:56.245
But this is an auspicious day.

40:56.912 --> 40:59.373
Proof that when the goal
is the greater good,

40:59.457 --> 41:02.293
people from all levels of government
can work together to achieve it.

41:03.002 --> 41:04.587
And it is in that spirit...

41:18.767 --> 41:20.186
And it is in that spirit...

41:23.272 --> 41:26.400
It is in that spirit that my partners
here on the dais,

41:26.484 --> 41:29.195
representatives of all aspects
of the government

41:29.278 --> 41:31.864
and our private sector investors
have worked together,

41:31.947 --> 41:33.908
not only to build a new bridge,

41:35.326 --> 41:37.786
but to ensure that
the tragedy of the old one

41:37.870 --> 41:40.247
never befalls another city
in this great nation.

41:49.924 --> 41:52.635
<i>It is with great honor</i>
<i>that we break ground here today.</i>

41:53.886 --> 41:55.221
[Isabel] He didn't even bring it up.

41:55.304 --> 41:57.848
I'm sorry, Isi.
I don't know what happened.

41:59.350 --> 42:02.269
I do. He became a politician.

42:29.880 --> 42:32.466
[man 1 over video] <i>I didn't vote</i>
<i>and I'm kinda proud of that</i>

42:32.550 --> 42:34.969
<i>because I did not like the person</i>
<i>that was running for office.</i>

42:35.052 --> 42:38.806
[woman] <i>I was arrested, ended up</i>
<i>pleading guilty to a felony count.</i>

42:38.889 --> 42:42.226
<i>Couple of months after realizing</i>
<i>that I was a felon,</i>

42:42.309 --> 42:43.978
<i>I realized I lost the right to vote.</i>

42:44.061 --> 42:45.854
<i>With it being on a Tuesday,</i>

42:45.938 --> 42:48.190
<i>I work two jobs</i>
<i>and go to school full time,</i>

42:48.274 --> 42:52.361
<i>so I don't have the availability</i>
<i>to just leave to go vote.</i>

42:52.444 --> 42:56.031
<i>I just didn't feel like I had the informed</i>
<i>opinion about who I was voting for.</i>

42:56.115 --> 42:58.576
<i>And I don't feel like anybody</i>
<i>represents me personally.</i>

42:58.659 --> 43:00.452
[man 2] <i>The two-party system doesn't work</i>

43:00.536 --> 43:03.789
<i>because we need more options to vote</i>
<i>other than just Republican or Democratic.</i>

43:03.872 --> 43:06.792
<i>If we had a third-party candidate</i>
<i>who had a fighting chance,</i>

43:06.875 --> 43:09.336
<i>then I'd be more inclined</i>
<i>to vote for that person.</i>

43:24.310 --> 43:25.436
[knocking]

43:27.187 --> 43:28.314
Hey.

43:31.692 --> 43:33.360
I know I disappointed you.

43:34.737 --> 43:36.155
I understand why you did it.

43:37.948 --> 43:40.117
[scoffs] I'm not sure I do.

43:40.784 --> 43:42.453
Doesn't mean I'm letting you off the hook.

43:42.536 --> 43:44.079
Once you're elected,
you have to make good on it.

43:44.747 --> 43:46.290
I will, I promise.

43:47.416 --> 43:49.084
Thank you for understanding.

43:50.210 --> 43:52.921
I do, and it's why
I need to leave the White House.

43:53.005 --> 43:54.340
Emily, please.

43:55.215 --> 43:56.216
I need you.

43:56.300 --> 43:58.677
I know you do,
and that's why I need to leave.

43:58.761 --> 44:01.472
-I want to move to the campaign.
-With Lorraine?

44:02.431 --> 44:03.641
Exactly.

44:05.184 --> 44:06.435
You don't trust her.

44:07.978 --> 44:09.104
Do you?

44:41.845 --> 44:42.846
[operator]<i> Good evening, Mr. Wright.</i>

44:42.930 --> 44:47.935
Hi. I'd like to make a phone call please,
to Stephanie Kapoor.

44:48.018 --> 44:50.896
The number is area code 3-8-0...

44:51.563 --> 44:53.107
5-5-5...

44:54.149 --> 44:56.777
0-1-8...

45:00.239 --> 45:04.368
[operator] <i>And the final digit?</i>
<i>Mr. Wright, are you there?</i>

45:06.286 --> 45:08.330
[speaking Spanish]

45:08.414 --> 45:11.834
If that's a booty call from one of
your exes because of that magazine...

45:13.502 --> 45:14.378
[Aaron] What?

45:15.254 --> 45:18.090
-Lorraine?
-Aaron. Can we talk?

45:18.632 --> 45:22.553
[stutters] Actually, right now
is not a good time at all, really.

45:22.636 --> 45:25.013
Come by the campaign office
first thing in the morning.

45:25.097 --> 45:26.932
And think about whether
you'd like to join the ticket

45:27.015 --> 45:28.809
as Kirkman's vice president.

45:39.570 --> 45:41.530
Penny, what are you still doing awake?

45:41.613 --> 45:43.157
I waited up for you.

45:44.032 --> 45:44.992
Pudding?

45:45.659 --> 45:47.035
Sure, why not?

45:49.246 --> 45:50.706
Well, thank you.

45:52.875 --> 45:54.376
How was North Carolina?

45:55.502 --> 45:59.006
North Carolina, well...
The fundraiser went late.

45:59.089 --> 46:00.632
Did you announce your new law?

46:02.342 --> 46:04.428
No. Not yet, sweetheart.

46:05.679 --> 46:06.555
Why?

46:10.225 --> 46:11.310
Just 'cause.

46:21.695 --> 46:24.156
Dr. Fein's security
is a little higher than yours.

46:24.239 --> 46:25.908
It's new from last year.

46:25.991 --> 46:28.076
His car was outside. He has to be here.

46:29.077 --> 46:30.704
All right, then maybe he's hurt.

46:31.455 --> 46:32.789
You know what? Step back.

46:32.873 --> 46:34.458
Or I could just, uh...

46:49.097 --> 46:51.141
Now I really wanna talk to your friend.

46:51.225 --> 46:52.559
[Eli] This makes no sense.

46:53.435 --> 46:55.771
Why would he take his entire lab
but leave his car?

46:55.854 --> 46:56.939
Well, he wouldn't.

46:58.148 --> 47:00.776
This entire place
has been scrubbed with bleach.

47:12.871 --> 47:14.289
Do you know where he could be?

47:15.123 --> 47:15.958
No.

47:38.981 --> 47:40.566
