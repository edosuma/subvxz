02:15.770 --> 02:18.480
'Cuz it chirps all night long.

02:18.850 --> 02:20.870

02:59.740 --> 03:02.470
- Why not?
- 'Cuz it's stupid.

03:03.240 --> 03:06.050
Why should we buy gifts

03:06.050 --> 03:08.870
- I mean what's the point?
- All right.

03:09.290 --> 03:12.790

You bought me a girl?

13:17.200 --> 13:18.620
No. No.

13:18.890 --> 13:20.840
YOU KNOW HOW YOU ALWAYS TALK ABOUT THAT BULLY...

13:25.310 --> 13:28.840
I HATED THAT BEEFY LITTLE WITCH AND HER MEAN FACE.

13:29.820 --> 13:33.510
AND YOU ALWAYS SAY YOU'D KILL FOR JUST ONE CHANCE TO TELL HER OFF?

13:33.880 --> 13:34.990
Yeah.

13:35.270 --> 13:36.290
Robbie.

13:36.780 --> 13:38.110
Christy Vicaris.

13:38.570 --> 13:39.730
You found her?!

13:39.730 --> 13:42.730
- You're Christy?
- So you wanna tell me off?

13:43.130 --> 13:45.300
Well... I did.

13:46.210 --> 13:47.410
But now you're hot.

13:49.510 --> 13:52.760
MAYBE YOU KIDS SHOULD GO TO JET BREW AND TALK THINGS OVER.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.070
Oh, I'm not paying three dollars for a cup of coffee.

13:58.850 --> 14:01.180

14:50.230 --> 14:52.490
I CAN NOT BELIEVE YOU GOT ME THESE.

14:53.210 --> 14:54.670
WHAT MOVIE WERE THEY USED IN?

14:55.110 --> 14:56.540
"THE SCISSORING".

14:57.650 --> 15:00.820
Wait, that one about the girl who comes back from the death

15:00.820 --> 15:03.010
and uses a pair of scissors on her two best friends?

15:03.500 --> 15:04.120
Yep.

15:04.150 --> 15:05.830
Starting with the pretty girl.

15:08.470 --> 15:09.380
OH.

15:09.900 --> 15:13.090
Um, anyway... you guys, I'm Andre's secret Santa,

15:13.120 --> 15:15.050
and I have like no clue what to give him.

15:15.310 --> 15:16.490
Just get him a present.

15:16.540 --> 15:17.530
Oh my God.

15:19.640 --> 15:20.920
Okay. Help me! Please.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.280
I don't want to give him the worst present

15:22.290 --> 15:25.310
and then have to go Christmas yodeling with Sikowitz.

15:25.780 --> 15:26.500
Two words...

15:26.550 --> 15:28.720
- I bet they won't be helpful.
- Your problem.

15:28.780 --> 15:29.910
I was right.

15:31.890 --> 15:39.310
Grrr! What do I get "a certain person" for Christmas?!?

15:39.310 --> 15:41.400
Feeling: UnMerry.

15:41.790 --> 15:43.150
Hey!

15:43.870 --> 15:46.110
SO WHEN DO THE DECORATIONS GO ON THAT THING?

15:46.140 --> 15:48.120
- Soon.
- First we have to flock it.

15:48.890 --> 15:50.060
YOU HAVE TO WHAT IT?

15:51.210 --> 15:52.130
Flock it.

15:52.810 --> 15:54.650
I... I don't understand.

15:54.650 --> 15:55.970
This is a flocking machine.

15:55.970 --> 15:58.370
And use it to spray fake snow all over the tree.

15:59.050 --> 16:01.180
- And that called flocking?
- Sure is.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.160
Someone's at the door, go get it.

16:11.270 --> 16:13.230
- Jade?
- Correct.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.440
What are you here for?

16:15.700 --> 16:16.710
You.

16:18.330 --> 16:19.510
Wait...

16:21.010 --> 16:22.830
DO YOU HAVE YOUR NEW SCISSORS WITH YOU?

16:23.210 --> 16:24.100
No.

16:32.310 --> 16:33.560
DON'T BE SHY.

16:41.370 --> 16:43.360
THOSE ARE MY OLD SCISSORS.

16:45.890 --> 16:47.780
Okay. So what do you want?

16:48.280 --> 16:49.720
Merry Christmas.

16:50.030 --> 16:52.440
- You're my secret Santa?
- Ho ho.

16:53.400 --> 16:54.710
Ho...

16:55.900 --> 16:57.790
So... what's my gift?

16:57.970 --> 17:00.960
An idea... for a present to give to Andre.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.290
- You have an idea?!
- A perfect one!

17:03.500 --> 17:05.339
Awesome, tell me!

17:06.640 --> 17:07.700
Beg me!

17:09.540 --> 17:12.170
C'mon, if you have an idea...

17:13.680 --> 17:15.099
How do I make it flock?

17:15.150 --> 17:17.359
Just press the red button right on top...

17:22.420 --> 17:23.550
Sorry.

17:24.599 --> 17:26.220
Please get me flock rag.

17:30.880 --> 17:36.640
OMVG! Jade just gave me the best idea ever!!!

17:36.640 --> 17:39.970
Feeling: Very Merry!

17:44.120 --> 17:45.160

- OKAY.

17:58.230 --> 18:01.690
- You bought me a cricket?
- Nope. I caught you a cricket.

18:01.960 --> 18:04.620

18:12.720 --> 18:14.400
How'd you know that crickets like peanut butter?

18:15.170 --> 18:16.730
Everybody likes peanut butter.

18:19.050 --> 18:20.610
Is that a cricket?

18:20.610 --> 18:21.500
- Yeah!
- Uh-huh.

18:22.250 --> 18:23.310
Can I have it?

18:24.910 --> 18:25.660
Sure.

18:27.580 --> 18:28.670
