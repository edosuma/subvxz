WEBVTT

00:13.435 --> 00:16.370
Punch it, Private!

00:16.438 --> 00:20.607
â™ª

00:20.675 --> 00:22.343
Ahh!

00:25.880 --> 00:26.847
Private.

00:26.914 --> 00:28.014
What was that!?

00:28.082 --> 00:30.083
You could've broken the track record!

00:31.652 --> 00:35.521
Oh, you're
welcome, little guy.

00:35.589 --> 00:36.556
Sorry, Skipper.

00:36.623 --> 00:39.025
I guess nice guys
really do finish last.

00:39.093 --> 00:42.328
Yup, that's just nature's
way, young Private.

00:42.395 --> 00:46.065
Yee-haw, hole in one!

00:46.132 --> 00:47.066
Intruder alert.

00:47.133 --> 00:48.367
Mister, I ain't no intruder.

00:48.434 --> 00:50.769
I am the Amarillo Kid.

00:50.837 --> 00:52.171
Should I know you?

00:52.239 --> 00:55.774
Only if your name is...
Mr. Tux.

00:55.842 --> 00:57.141
Oh!

00:57.209 --> 00:59.810
Kowalski, my alias portfolio.

00:59.879 --> 01:03.081
Let's see, there's two-bit
hood Jack the Knife,

01:03.148 --> 01:06.717
international playbird Diego
Garcia, wealthy industrialist

01:06.785 --> 01:07.986
Lincoln Douglas.

01:08.053 --> 01:10.154
I'm not seeing a Mr.
Tux here, Skipper.

01:10.222 --> 01:12.422
Perhaps it was the time I
woke up in that Kyoto hotel

01:12.490 --> 01:15.692
room on a bed of counterfeit
Deutsche Marks.

01:15.760 --> 01:17.794
I'm Mr. Tux.

01:21.299 --> 01:22.232
Oh, yeah.

01:22.300 --> 01:24.701
Well thanks, young Private,
I think I got this.

01:24.769 --> 01:25.869
Ha!

01:25.937 --> 01:27.004
Well, Mr. Tux.

01:27.071 --> 01:28.404
Been a long time.

01:28.471 --> 01:31.240
Longer than a yeller snake in
a bowl of red bean chilli.

01:31.308 --> 01:32.241
What?

01:32.309 --> 01:34.944
See, Mr. Tux and me, we have
some unfinished "bidness."

01:35.012 --> 01:36.578
Our Private?

01:36.646 --> 01:38.847
Your business is all
finished, isn't it, Private?

01:38.916 --> 01:39.882
No, Skipper.

01:39.950 --> 01:42.318
The Amarillo Kid and I have
been on a collision course for

01:42.386 --> 01:44.219
a long, long time.

01:44.287 --> 01:45.486
Yeah, that's right.

01:45.554 --> 01:47.622
Longer than a yeller... Zip it, Kid!

01:47.689 --> 01:49.057
You're wasting your breath.

01:49.125 --> 01:50.591
I'm a different man, now.

01:50.659 --> 01:51.726
Man?

01:51.794 --> 01:54.029
But Private's so...
Private-y.

01:54.096 --> 01:55.030
What's this about?

01:55.097 --> 01:57.632
Mr.
Tux knows what it's about.

01:57.699 --> 01:58.666
I told you.

01:58.734 --> 02:01.035
Never again.

02:01.102 --> 02:02.669
Never say never.

02:02.737 --> 02:06.173
Unless it's when you're
saying never to say... Never.

02:06.241 --> 02:07.874
Heh.

02:07.943 --> 02:10.911
Armadillos are all just whacked
out from the scorching

02:10.979 --> 02:13.680
desert heat.

02:13.748 --> 02:15.316
Well, Private.

02:15.383 --> 02:18.752
What an unexpected dimension
this adds to your character.

02:18.820 --> 02:21.087
Yeah, that's... I don't like it!

02:21.155 --> 02:22.489
I like my men one-dimensional.

02:22.557 --> 02:24.458
Works better for me.

02:24.525 --> 02:25.525
Hmm?

02:25.593 --> 02:26.526
Oh, heh.

02:26.594 --> 02:27.594
Sorry, Skipper.

02:27.662 --> 02:28.795
I was young and foolish.

02:30.030 --> 02:31.064
Sorry.

02:31.131 --> 02:34.066
Went down the wrong oesophagus.

02:34.133 --> 02:35.167
Here's what we got.

02:35.234 --> 02:38.036
Two eggs, two flapjacks,
two strips of bacon.

02:38.104 --> 02:39.338
One smiley face.

02:39.405 --> 02:41.073
Might make you change your mind.

02:41.140 --> 02:43.843
What do you say, Mr. Tux?

02:43.910 --> 02:46.912
Mr. Tux left nothing but a
trail of broken hearts and

02:46.980 --> 02:48.513
shattered dreams.

02:48.581 --> 02:51.148
Tell you what, you sure
shattered my dreams.

02:51.216 --> 02:53.685
Like a big old china plate.

02:53.752 --> 02:54.953
Of dreams.

02:55.020 --> 02:58.756
No, I will not play your
cursed game, Amarillo Kid.

02:58.824 --> 03:01.459
Well, we'll just see about that,
dramatic pronouncement n'

03:01.527 --> 03:05.395
such Mr. Tux.

03:05.463 --> 03:07.464
What does he mean, game?

03:07.532 --> 03:11.001
It was brutal combat, Skipper,
and I was the best.

03:11.068 --> 03:14.137
But I walked away
before it destroyed me.

03:14.205 --> 03:15.238
Uh, guys?

03:15.306 --> 03:19.242
I think you're gonna
wanna get out here.

03:24.748 --> 03:26.749
Hey, what's the deal?

03:26.817 --> 03:30.219
I'm just warming up on the
locals before I whup Mr. Tux.

03:30.286 --> 03:33.556
Wait, you mean the
"brutal combat" was...?

03:33.624 --> 03:35.257
Mini golf.

03:36.426 --> 03:37.626
Sorry again.

03:37.693 --> 03:39.127
I thought he said, "mini golf."

03:39.194 --> 03:40.228
No, that's right.

03:40.295 --> 03:41.229
Miniature golf.

03:42.765 --> 03:45.166
With the windmills and
the neon coloured balls?

03:45.234 --> 03:47.802
And the little pencil-y things?

03:47.870 --> 03:48.937
Oh, you betcha.

03:49.005 --> 03:51.105
Now, if you don't mind,
watch me sink this putt.

03:51.173 --> 03:54.207
Oh, he's made this interesting.

03:54.275 --> 03:56.343
Everybody be interested.

03:56.411 --> 03:57.912
"Made it interesting?"

03:57.979 --> 04:00.147
You mean you're betting this nutball?

04:00.214 --> 04:03.350
Technically, I'm losing
everything to this nutball.

04:03.418 --> 04:06.353
But I can't let that
distract me from my game.

04:06.421 --> 04:08.088
Julian, he's hustling you.

04:08.156 --> 04:09.221
Oh, really?

04:09.289 --> 04:11.357
Well, what makes you think so?

04:11.425 --> 04:15.394
Look out, clown's mouth.

04:15.462 --> 04:17.629
I don't know,
call it a hunch.

04:17.697 --> 04:18.764
Not to worry.

04:18.831 --> 04:21.666
I have already doubled down, so
all I need to do is make this

04:21.733 --> 04:22.668
shot.

04:22.735 --> 04:23.735
Doubled down?

04:23.803 --> 04:25.837
But what have you got left to bet?

04:25.905 --> 04:27.206
Nothing that is too valuable.

04:27.274 --> 04:29.675
Only my "loyalest" subjects.

04:29.742 --> 04:31.143
Yeah, me!

04:31.211 --> 04:34.011
Look, this isn't fair, Kid,
that shot is impossible.

04:34.080 --> 04:35.680
Impossible for him, maybe.

04:35.747 --> 04:38.616
But not for Mr. Tux.

04:38.684 --> 04:41.519
I think I might stuff 'em and
put 'em next to my jackalope.

04:41.587 --> 04:44.055
Maybe put little antlers on them, too.

04:44.123 --> 04:45.590
Call 'em "lemur-lopes."

04:45.657 --> 04:46.824
Wait!

04:56.667 --> 05:00.637
I swore, I swore I would never,
ever, ever play that infernal

05:00.705 --> 05:01.838
game again.

05:03.241 --> 05:04.508
Okay, my bad.

05:04.576 --> 05:06.909
I really should just
put this mug down.

05:06.977 --> 05:07.943
Private.

05:08.011 --> 05:10.012
What could be so infernal
about mini golf?

05:11.482 --> 05:12.681
It wasn't the game.

05:12.749 --> 05:14.250
It's what it did to me.

05:15.685 --> 05:17.253
I started playing for fun.

05:17.321 --> 05:19.222
But I was good.

05:19.289 --> 05:22.056
I was too good.

05:22.125 --> 05:24.292
Pretty soon, every young punk
who thought he could hit a

05:24.360 --> 05:26.394
straight putt came looking for me.

05:26.462 --> 05:29.964
And then one day, a young
armadillo was playing me tough.

05:38.573 --> 05:43.677
And I started to worry...
That for the first time, I might lose.

05:43.745 --> 05:45.712
So I did the unthinkable.

05:54.455 --> 05:55.821
That was it for me.

05:55.889 --> 05:59.125
I just walked away.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.860
So you quit the game?

06:00.927 --> 06:02.629
Yes, forever.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.730
Over an ice cream cone?

06:04.798 --> 06:05.731
It was a double scoop!

06:05.799 --> 06:07.733
Couldn't you just buy the
girl another ice cream,

06:07.801 --> 06:10.735
or, you know, I don't... It wasn't
just the ice cream, it was me!

06:10.803 --> 06:12.837
The pressure of the competition
was making me tart.

06:12.905 --> 06:14.139
And churlish.

06:14.207 --> 06:17.909
And yes, I'll admit it, at
times, even a bit... Snippety.

06:17.977 --> 06:20.712
Well, Private, as utterly
ridiculous as that sounds to all

06:20.780 --> 06:23.848
of us, we're behind you 100%.

06:25.750 --> 06:28.819
You know what I'm here for.

06:28.887 --> 06:32.190
Sorry, armadillo, Mr.
Tux is retired.

06:32.257 --> 06:33.257
Permanently.

06:33.325 --> 06:35.593
Don't make me take Rico off his leash.

06:36.728 --> 06:38.962
I got a date with destiny, Mister.

06:39.030 --> 06:40.864
You don't mess with destiny.

06:40.932 --> 06:41.964
Or Texas.

06:42.032 --> 06:46.936
Both... What do you say, Mr.
Tux?

06:47.004 --> 06:50.440
Fancy a little game?

06:50.508 --> 06:53.042
I warned you, Kid!

06:53.110 --> 06:55.645
Rico, find the armadillo,
do something horrific.

06:55.713 --> 06:56.879
Oh yeah.

06:56.947 --> 07:00.816
Self destruct
sequence initiated.

07:00.883 --> 07:04.220
A thermo fusion reactor!

07:04.287 --> 07:05.387
Yeah, 'bout that?

07:05.455 --> 07:08.390
I took the liberty of changing
the deactivation code.

07:10.159 --> 07:14.462
So no one gets out of here until
I've had my game with Mr. Tux.

07:17.999 --> 07:21.402
You think you can manually override
the self-destruct sequence?

07:21.470 --> 07:23.070
Probably not.

07:23.138 --> 07:26.073
Private, I know you swore
never to play again.

07:26.141 --> 07:29.644
If he wants Mr.
Tux, I'll give him Mr. Tux.

07:29.712 --> 07:31.345
Now you go get him, Private.

07:31.412 --> 07:35.449
We all believe in you.

07:38.987 --> 07:42.389
Live from Central Park
Zoo, in, you know, Central

07:42.457 --> 07:46.192
Park, hello and welcome
to the Zoosters Cup.

07:46.260 --> 07:49.695
I will be your whispery announcer guy.

07:49.764 --> 07:52.866
You're gonna give me your best game, Mr.
Tux, or this

07:52.933 --> 07:56.502
whole animal farm won't be worth
more than a toothless sidewinder

07:56.570 --> 07:57.871
on Easter Sunday!

07:57.938 --> 08:00.240
And the trash talk is inscrutable.

08:00.307 --> 08:01.641
He's gonna blow up the zoo?

08:01.708 --> 08:02.674
Ooh!

08:02.742 --> 08:04.542
High stakes, exciting.

08:04.610 --> 08:06.812
Shh, they're about to tee off.

08:06.880 --> 08:07.813
Quiet in the gallery!

08:07.881 --> 08:10.816
The instruction manual is around
here somewhere, I know it.

08:10.884 --> 08:11.817
Here we go, got it!

08:11.885 --> 08:13.986
No, wait, this is for the microwave.

08:14.053 --> 08:17.256
Ohh, we have a popcorn setting?

08:26.231 --> 08:30.334
Yee haw!

08:30.402 --> 08:33.304
"Press and hold the start
button for five seconds.

08:33.371 --> 08:34.537
Then toggle... "

08:34.605 --> 08:36.639
I'm pressing the start button!

08:36.707 --> 08:37.941
That's the menu button.

08:38.009 --> 08:42.011
Oh, well, which one is...
So, our two mini golf

08:42.078 --> 08:46.549
gladiators enter the
final hole all tied up.

08:46.617 --> 08:49.885
Not like in ropes, but, you
know, like, in scores.

08:49.953 --> 08:54.156
A hush has fallen over the crowd
and I, oh, am I right in the way

08:54.224 --> 08:58.894
here, a little bit?

09:00.463 --> 09:02.431
It was worth a try!

09:07.769 --> 09:10.738
You hit that shot and
you beat me, Mr. Tux.

09:10.806 --> 09:12.974
Guess you'd best not miss.

09:13.042 --> 09:17.378
Count on it.

09:20.382 --> 09:21.316
Oopsie.

09:22.383 --> 09:23.317
Hey, what was that?

09:23.384 --> 09:24.318
No fair!

09:24.385 --> 09:26.053
I decide what's fair.

09:26.120 --> 09:29.723
And Mr.
Tux needs to sink that shot!

09:29.790 --> 09:32.259
Private, I know I
throw the encouragement around

09:32.327 --> 09:33.426
like candy.

09:33.494 --> 09:34.594
This time I mean it.

09:34.662 --> 09:39.398
'Cause I have no choice.

09:39.466 --> 09:40.666
Quick, what is he doing?

09:40.734 --> 09:45.404
But that's the opposite direction.

09:45.472 --> 09:49.141
Here we go, for the
match and the bragger's rights.

09:49.209 --> 09:53.746
And all of our lives.

09:53.813 --> 09:55.480
I can't watch!

09:55.547 --> 09:58.483
But I must peek.

10:08.961 --> 10:10.027
It's all over!

10:10.095 --> 10:11.195
I'm the best!

10:11.263 --> 10:14.999
I told you, I'm fancier than
a peacock in a crow flock.

10:15.066 --> 10:16.066
Yeehaw!

10:16.134 --> 10:17.167
No, Kid.

10:17.235 --> 10:19.669
You might wanna take
back that "yeehaw!"

10:19.737 --> 10:21.605
Huh, what the...?

10:27.711 --> 10:28.677
He did it!

10:28.745 --> 10:30.179
And the stinky penguin wins!

10:30.247 --> 10:32.848
Yay for the Private in a bowtie!

10:32.917 --> 10:35.484
Well, Kid, you wanted my best game.

10:35.552 --> 10:36.752
How's it taste?

10:36.820 --> 10:39.289
Like a tall glass of loser?

10:40.424 --> 10:43.959
Kinda.

10:44.027 --> 10:46.628
Nice job, young Mr.
Tux.

10:46.695 --> 10:48.863
That last shot, I mean, wow!

10:48.932 --> 10:50.299
The ball had totally stopped!

10:50.366 --> 10:51.833
How did you do it, Private?

10:51.901 --> 10:54.605
Well, let's just say...
Nice guys don't always finish last.
