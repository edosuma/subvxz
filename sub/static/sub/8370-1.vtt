Did ya now?
My stomach
keeps forgettin'.

01:33.309 --> 01:35.410
His stomach forgets.

01:37.347 --> 01:38.547
That's a good one!

01:38.581 --> 01:40.449
Go!

Oh, no.

We're leaving?

01:53.196 --> 01:54.530
What about lunch?

01:54.564 --> 01:56.532
All of a sudden
I'm not so hungry.

01:56.566 --> 01:59.468
But Janja!
You said
you were starving!

01:59.502 --> 02:01.270
JANJA: Just run,
fur brain!

02:03.173 --> 02:04.239
That's right!

02:20.356 --> 02:22.224
You're all okay now.

02:22.258 --> 02:26.161
Yeah! Kion's chased
those hyenas back
into the Outlands!

02:26.196 --> 02:27.496
And he should
be back by now.

02:27.530 --> 02:29.298

02:54.190 --> 02:56.158
Ono! Keep pace
with Kion!

Right!

Kion, look out!

(COUGHS)

03:41.371 --> 03:43.105
But I'm okay.

03:43.139 --> 03:44.339
But Kion, look.

03:44.374 --> 03:45.407
You're over here.

03:45.441 --> 03:47.242
In the Outlands.

03:47.277 --> 03:49.311
I can see that,
Ono.

03:49.345 --> 03:52.514
And it looks like
I can take that
trail upriver.

03:52.548 --> 03:55.284
Don't worry, Ono.
I'll be fine.

03:55.318 --> 03:58.153
Besides, I don't have
much of a choice.

03:58.187 --> 04:00.355
I definitely can't
cross the river here.

04:00.390 --> 04:02.424
The water's way too rough.

04:02.458 --> 04:05.260
Lion Guard! Meet me
at Flat Ridge Rock!

04:05.295 --> 04:07.162
I can cross
the river there!

04:07.196 --> 04:09.064
Huh?
Flat Ridge Rock?

04:09.098 --> 04:11.199
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I know exactly
where that is.

04:11.234 --> 04:13.035
Follow me!

04:13.069 --> 04:14.369
Thanks, Bunga!

04:14.404 --> 04:16.138
Ono!
Yes, Kion?

04:16.172 --> 04:18.040
Better go with them.

04:18.074 --> 04:20.442
Make sure Bunga
really does know
where Flat Ridge Rock is.

04:20.476 --> 04:23.078
Affirmative!
Guys, wait up!

04:35.325 --> 04:37.192
C'mon!
C'mon!

04:37.226 --> 04:40.128
We don't want Kion waitin'
up at Flat Ridge Rock,
wondering where we are.

(EXCLAIMS)

04:44.200 --> 04:45.334
What's wrong, Little B?

04:45.368 --> 04:47.336
Uh, nothing.

04:47.370 --> 04:51.440
Bunga? Are you sure
you know how to get
to Flat Ridge Rock?

04:51.474 --> 04:53.508
Pfft! Of course,
I know.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.310
It's this way!

04:59.282 --> 05:00.449

05:00.483 --> 05:03.218

no, no. It's this way!

05:10.393 --> 05:12.361
(HISSING)

05:12.395 --> 05:15.163
Going somewhere,
Bunga?

05:16.466 --> 05:18.433
Nope!
Gotta be this way.

05:21.437 --> 05:23.405
Well, it's one
of these ways.

05:23.439 --> 05:25.307
Too bad Kion's
not here to lead us.

05:25.341 --> 05:27.209
Do you even
know where we are?

05:27.243 --> 05:29.077
Sure! Uh...

05:29.112 --> 05:30.278
We're lost!

05:30.313 --> 05:31.313

(GASPS)

05:55.371 --> 05:56.505
(LAUGHS)

05:56.539 --> 05:59.074
Didn't know
I was up here.
Did ya?

05:59.108 --> 06:00.342
No, I...

06:00.376 --> 06:02.477
I knew you were
there the whole time.

06:02.512 --> 06:04.012
Hyena.

06:04.047 --> 06:05.480
Yep, I'm a hyena
all right.

06:05.515 --> 06:08.350
You lions
are so clever!

06:08.384 --> 06:10.085

06:10.119 --> 06:12.287
Especially you, Kion.

06:12.321 --> 06:15.023
Leader of the Lion Guard.

06:15.058 --> 06:17.225
You know me?
Just by reputation.

06:17.260 --> 06:19.294
The mark
on your shoulder's
a giveaway, though.

06:19.328 --> 06:20.395
(LAUGHS)

06:20.430 --> 06:23.198
So, you're not
in Janja's clan?

06:23.232 --> 06:26.168
Janja? Yeah,
that's a good one.

06:26.202 --> 06:27.502
What are you doing
in the Outlands?

06:27.537 --> 06:30.105
Not exactly
your territory.

06:30.139 --> 06:32.140
I'm going to
Flat Ridge Rock,

06:32.175 --> 06:34.376
so I can get back
to the Pride Lands.

06:34.410 --> 06:36.178
If that's okay with you,

06:36.212 --> 06:37.279
hyena.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.081
The name's Jasiri.

06:39.115 --> 06:42.451
And if you are headed
back to the Pride Lands,
you're going the wrong way.

06:42.485 --> 06:46.421
Uh-huh. And I should
trust a hyena because...

06:46.456 --> 06:49.524
Because I want you
out of my territory.

06:49.559 --> 06:54.096
Good. I want out
of your territory.
(SCOFFS)

06:54.130 --> 06:56.164
Then you're going
the wrong way!

07:03.039 --> 07:04.339
Thanks for getting us
outta the woods, Ono.

07:04.373 --> 07:07.442
No problem. But I don't know
which way to go from here.

07:07.477 --> 07:09.311
I've never been
to Flat Ridge Rock.

07:09.345 --> 07:11.346
Neither have I.
Me neither.

07:13.382 --> 07:17.119
Well, it's probably
around here somewhere.

07:17.153 --> 07:19.387
BESHTE: All I see are grass,
trees and zebras.

07:19.422 --> 07:22.290
Ugh! I can't believe
we don't know
where to go!

07:22.325 --> 07:24.025
We're the Lion Guard!

07:24.060 --> 07:27.295
(SIGHS) This never happens
when Kion's around!

07:27.330 --> 07:29.030
Easy, Fuli.

07:29.065 --> 07:31.233
We just need to ask
somebody for directions.

07:31.267 --> 07:35.237
Hello, Lion Guard.
I couldn't help
but overhear.

07:35.271 --> 07:37.305
You need directions?

07:37.340 --> 07:38.373
Yeah, we do!

07:38.407 --> 07:41.076
Do you know where
Flat Ridge Rock is?

07:41.110 --> 07:42.410
Flat Ridge Rock?

07:42.445 --> 07:46.081
Oh! Is that
near Ukuni Woods?

07:46.115 --> 07:47.482
Or Big Springs?

07:47.517 --> 07:49.518
We don't know
where it is.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.520
That's why
we're asking you!

07:51.554 --> 07:55.056
I see. Well,
that's too bad.

07:55.091 --> 07:57.092
I'm not sure where it is.

07:57.126 --> 07:59.194
Now, where was I going?

07:59.228 --> 08:01.429
Uh, maybe back
to your herd?

08:01.464 --> 08:04.332
Oh yes, of course!

08:04.367 --> 08:06.234
Thank you!

08:06.269 --> 08:08.103
Zebras. (SIGHS)

08:08.137 --> 08:10.205
They never know
where they're going.

08:10.239 --> 08:12.440
Hey! We could ask
Mbeya the Rhino!

08:12.475 --> 08:15.310
He knows
the Pride Lands like
the back of his horn.

08:15.344 --> 08:18.146
Great. Any idea where
we can find Mbeya?

08:18.181 --> 08:21.416
This time of day,
Mbeya usually hangs out
at the watering hole.

08:21.450 --> 08:25.487
Yeah! Watering hole,
here we come.

08:25.521 --> 08:28.490
(GRUNTS)
Ono, you lead
this time.

08:28.524 --> 08:31.026
Affirmative!
Follow me!

08:33.229 --> 08:34.496
FULI: This way, Bunga.

08:36.365 --> 08:39.201
I was taking
a shortcut.

08:44.473 --> 08:45.440
(GRUNTS)

08:50.379 --> 08:52.147
Still following me?

08:52.181 --> 08:54.182
You're still
ignoring my advice.

08:54.217 --> 08:56.351
About going the wrong way?
(SCOFFS)

08:56.385 --> 08:59.120
I'm pretty sure
I'm heading towards
Flat Ridge Rock.

08:59.155 --> 09:02.190
Maybe so,
but you can't get
there on this trail.

09:02.225 --> 09:04.259
Oh, yeah?
Why's that?

09:04.293 --> 09:06.094
The trail ends.
Here!

09:06.128 --> 09:07.195
What? Whoa...

09:10.199 --> 09:12.234

09:15.037 --> 09:16.204
(GROWLS)

09:18.207 --> 09:21.009
(SIGHS) How long
can it possibly take

09:21.043 --> 09:24.012
to ask for directions
to Flat Ridge Rock?

09:24.046 --> 09:25.380
They've been
talking forever!

09:25.414 --> 09:27.482
Beshte does
like to talk.

09:27.516 --> 09:31.019
Yes. But perhaps
I'd better go talk to him.

09:31.053 --> 09:34.155
You get to be my age,
you never know
what might happen!

09:34.190 --> 09:35.423
(LAUGHS)

09:35.458 --> 09:37.392
Sorry to interrupt.
But Beshte?

09:37.426 --> 09:38.493
We have to meet Kion?

09:38.527 --> 09:40.161
At Flat Ridge Rock?

09:40.196 --> 09:42.264
Oh yeah! Guess
I better be going.

09:42.298 --> 09:45.367
See you later, Mbeya.
Later, Beshte.

09:45.401 --> 09:47.302
So?
What did he say?

09:47.336 --> 09:48.503
You won't believe it.

09:48.537 --> 09:51.139
Remember that heatwave
we had yesterday?

09:51.173 --> 09:52.507
Yeah, I remember.
It was hot.

09:52.541 --> 09:54.342
Now what did Mbeya say?

09:54.377 --> 09:56.478
He forgot to cover
himself in mud!

09:56.512 --> 09:58.413
(LAUGHS)

09:58.447 --> 10:01.116
Why would Mbeya
want to cover himself
in mud, Big B?

10:01.150 --> 10:02.350
That's how
rhinos avoid sunburn.

10:02.385 --> 10:04.219
Common knowledge, really.

10:04.253 --> 10:09.057
(SIGHS) I meant,
what did Mbeya say
about the directions?

10:09.091 --> 10:12.427
(CHUCKLES) Fuli, you don't
need directions to cover
yourself in mud.

10:12.461 --> 10:15.096
Just find a nice
mud puddle and roll in it.

10:15.131 --> 10:18.300
Argh! Not directions
for mud bathing.

10:18.334 --> 10:21.303
Directions for getting
to Flat Ridge Rock!

10:21.337 --> 10:24.272
Oh, yeah!
The directions to
Flat Ridge Rock!

10:26.375 --> 10:29.244
I forgot to ask.
Be right back.

10:29.278 --> 10:30.445
(ALL GRUNT)

10:30.479 --> 10:33.481
Yeah. Kion would never
forget something like that.

10:34.350 --> 10:35.450
(JASIRI LAUGHING)

10:35.484 --> 10:38.486

this won't hurt at all.

10:40.289 --> 10:42.090
Hey, what are you doing?

10:42.124 --> 10:44.225
Getting you out

10:45.161 --> 10:46.561
If you'd just hold still!

10:47.530 --> 10:50.231
What? Why would
you help me?

10:50.266 --> 10:51.566
You're a hyena.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.502
You lions really do think
all hyenas are bad!

10:54.537 --> 10:56.404
All the ones I've met are.

10:56.439 --> 10:58.506
Like Janja, Cheezi,
and Chungu?

10:58.541 --> 11:02.510
(CHUCKLES)
Well, obviously,
I'm not like them.

11:02.545 --> 11:06.414
For one thing, they're males.
Which means they're foolish.

11:07.316 --> 11:08.450
No offense.

11:08.484 --> 11:11.152
Not all males are foolish.

11:11.187 --> 11:14.255

flat on his back,
stuck in a bush.

11:14.290 --> 11:15.457
(LAUGHING)

11:18.327 --> 11:21.396
Things would certainly
go a lot better if Kion
were leading us.

11:21.430 --> 11:24.366
Yeah. But you gotta
love all these flies!

11:27.269 --> 11:29.471
Ugh. Yeah,
gotta love 'em.

11:29.505 --> 11:34.442
Beshte, are you positive
Mbeya said this is the way
to Flat Ridge Rock?

11:34.477 --> 11:37.512
Yep! 'Course, he also said
he's never actually
been there.

11:37.546 --> 11:39.114
(GROANS)

11:43.185 --> 11:46.354
Everyone! There's
a ridge up ahead with
a flat rock on top of it!

11:46.389 --> 11:48.289
It's gotta be Flat Ridge Rock!

11:48.324 --> 11:50.191
<i> Zuka Zama!</i>

11:50.226 --> 11:52.260
Kion, here we come!

11:52.294 --> 11:54.295
This time,
I'll lead the way.

11:54.330 --> 11:55.397
Comin' through.

11:59.135 --> 12:03.037
Fuli, slow down!
How can you lead us
when we can't keep up?

12:06.075 --> 12:08.276
Thanks...
I guess.

12:08.310 --> 12:09.444
You guess?

12:09.478 --> 12:11.279
Well, yeah!

12:11.313 --> 12:14.315
You could have told me
the trail ended before
I went over the hill!

12:14.350 --> 12:16.050
Yeah. But then
I wouldn't have seen

12:16.085 --> 12:18.486
the leader of the Lion Guard
rolling down a hill!

12:18.521 --> 12:20.121
(LAUGHS)

12:20.156 --> 12:24.159
Okay, you've had your laugh.
Now I'm lost.

12:24.193 --> 12:27.495
Can you tell me how
to get to Flat Ridge Rock?

12:27.530 --> 12:29.097
Follow that trail.

12:29.131 --> 12:30.532
It'll take you
to Flat Ridge Rock.

12:30.566 --> 12:34.202
And back to
your beloved Pride Lands.

12:34.236 --> 12:36.171
Thanks.
(GRUNTS)

12:36.205 --> 12:38.406
You're limping.
I'm fine.

12:38.441 --> 12:40.442
Just a little sore
from the fall.

12:40.476 --> 12:42.076
I can handle it.

12:43.279 --> 12:44.412
Okay, tell ya what.

12:44.447 --> 12:47.315
It's kinda
my fault you're hurt.

12:47.349 --> 12:51.186
So I'll stick with you
until you can see
Flat Ridge Rock.

12:51.220 --> 12:54.422
Okay. I mean,
if you want to.

12:54.457 --> 12:56.424
What I want?
(LAUGHS)

12:56.459 --> 12:59.127
I want you out
of my territory!

12:59.161 --> 13:02.096
(GRUNTS) Yeah,
well, me too.

13:05.067 --> 13:06.334
(GRUNTING AND SIGHING)

13:09.071 --> 13:10.238
Huh?
Fuli?

13:10.272 --> 13:12.207
Hi, guys.
What kept you?

13:12.241 --> 13:15.076
I even had time
to clean up.

13:15.110 --> 13:17.045
Uh, Fuli?

13:17.079 --> 13:21.115
Usually Kion wouldn't get
so far ahead that the rest
of us have trouble keeping up.

13:21.150 --> 13:23.051
Oh. Sorry, guys.

13:23.085 --> 13:25.353
Wait! This is
Flat Ridge Rock?

13:25.387 --> 13:27.288
Well, this rock
is pretty flat.

13:27.323 --> 13:29.157
And it's on a ridge.

13:29.191 --> 13:31.059
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah!

13:31.093 --> 13:34.262
I know this place!
I've been here
hundreds of times!

13:34.296 --> 13:37.465
You know,
there's a great shortcut
we could have used!

13:37.500 --> 13:39.200
ALL: Bunga!

13:40.569 --> 13:42.070
What?

13:44.340 --> 13:46.140
(GULPS)

13:46.175 --> 13:48.543
See that? That's
the Circle of Life for you.

13:48.577 --> 13:52.347
Wait. You think I don't know
about the Circle of Life?

13:52.381 --> 13:54.349
Well, you are a hyena.

13:54.383 --> 13:58.520
Look. I know Janja's clan
is greedy and eats more
than their share.

13:58.554 --> 14:02.023
But most hyenas
respect the Circle of Life!

14:02.057 --> 14:03.324
We're the clean-up crews.

14:03.359 --> 14:06.160
Picking up after
all the sloppy eaters.

14:06.195 --> 14:09.297
We hyenas eat what
you lions leave behind.

14:09.331 --> 14:13.268
Oh. I guess I never really
thought about it like that.

14:13.302 --> 14:16.371
(LAUGHS)
Of course not.

14:16.405 --> 14:20.308
You think hyenas
and lions are so different.

14:20.342 --> 14:21.476
But we're not!

14:21.510 --> 14:24.112
