WEBVTT

00:01.680 --> 00:02.945
Will you be my fake wife?

00:02.969 --> 00:04.250
Fake? Yeah, I will.

00:04.362 --> 00:05.602
Which one of you is the couple?

00:05.627 --> 00:06.874
We are!

00:07.085 --> 00:08.285
You're a thrupple?

00:08.310 --> 00:12.437
Know what's so great about you,
Adam? Everything is so easy. No drama.

00:12.462 --> 00:14.098
- Gabi.
- Amanda?

00:15.386 --> 00:16.671
I want you.

00:21.273 --> 00:22.473
Shwa!

00:22.566 --> 00:23.900
Last available room.

00:23.925 --> 00:26.468
Oh, my God, look at your
face. You're so excited!

00:30.755 --> 00:34.800
Oh, my God, this room looks just
like the other room I was staying in.

00:34.926 --> 00:37.250
Where nothing happened.

00:37.472 --> 00:41.117
But now, I'm in a different room where
something probably could happen and...

00:41.142 --> 00:43.553
and probably will because that's
how life works with two normal,

00:43.578 --> 00:46.098
healthy, sexually active individuals
staying in a room together.

00:47.119 --> 00:48.649
- Gabi.
- Mm-hmm?

00:49.158 --> 00:51.553
Okay, how about this? Let's
just... let's just both breathe.

00:55.955 --> 00:57.590
Gabi, look, I get it.

00:57.830 --> 00:59.412
Okay? I put you through hell.

00:59.437 --> 01:01.539
You have every right
to be acting, you know,

01:01.564 --> 01:02.864
how you're acting.

01:03.216 --> 01:08.420
Right. Yeah, I got a lot going
on up here that I gotta process.

01:08.445 --> 01:10.412
So, uh, is it okay if we just kinda...

01:10.437 --> 01:11.969
- Take it slow?
- Yeah.

01:12.123 --> 01:13.325
Sounds good to me.

01:14.007 --> 01:16.342
- Hey, how about a drink?
- I need that very much.

01:19.476 --> 01:21.811
Oh, this was so sweet of you.

01:21.836 --> 01:23.408
Yeah, well, I'm a sweet guy.

01:25.249 --> 01:26.450
Mm.

01:26.475 --> 01:28.517
Oh! Um...

01:28.551 --> 01:31.990
I can't believe you surprised
me by getting us this room.

01:32.015 --> 01:33.810
Um, I... I didn't ask for this.

01:33.835 --> 01:39.100
You just did this for me, which is
so sweet, and I had no say whatsoever.

01:40.350 --> 01:41.775
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

01:42.198 --> 01:43.509
Sorry for what?

01:43.953 --> 01:45.711
Sorry for, um...

01:45.736 --> 01:47.604
Oh! For that!

01:47.629 --> 01:48.936
Oh, shoot.

01:48.961 --> 01:50.616
Can you go get us some more ice, please?

01:51.883 --> 01:54.430
Wow, you really got a
lot going on in there.

01:54.455 --> 01:55.655
Yeah.

01:57.040 --> 01:59.401
- Okay, this is a nightmare.
- Ha! You think?

01:59.426 --> 02:02.151
How are we gonna stay right next to
each other when we got this going on?

02:02.176 --> 02:06.422
No, no, no, there was no this
because this is not a this.

02:07.384 --> 02:08.769
But we just had an amazing kiss

02:08.794 --> 02:10.588
- five minutes ago.
- Shh!

02:11.102 --> 02:12.436
You thought it was amazing?

02:13.164 --> 02:15.340
I did. What did you think it was?

02:15.365 --> 02:17.332
I thought it was...

02:17.357 --> 02:18.898
a vacation kiss.

02:18.923 --> 02:21.098
Right? We were just caught up in the sun

02:21.123 --> 02:23.665
and the sand, and all the allure of

02:23.689 --> 02:25.690
Flip Flops for Lovers.

02:26.920 --> 02:30.358
Maybe you're right. Maybe it was just
a vacation kiss. Didn't mean anything.

02:30.383 --> 02:32.720
- Absolutely nothing.
- Okay, well, that's a little rude.

02:33.756 --> 02:35.652
All I'm saying is that...

02:35.959 --> 02:40.408
if it didn't mean anything, we have
no problem. We can both stay here.

02:40.896 --> 02:42.264
Oh, my God.

02:42.289 --> 02:44.408
You're right. We can both stay here.

02:44.433 --> 02:46.297
You know what? It
doesn't have to be weird.

02:46.759 --> 02:48.460
Okay, it's weird. It's weird!

02:48.971 --> 02:50.872
I gotta get out of Hawaii!

03:12.672 --> 03:14.528
Hey, Gabi! What's up?

03:14.553 --> 03:15.897
Sofia, I need you.

03:15.922 --> 03:17.162
And I need you.

03:17.187 --> 03:20.362
Can you spray the pan after
the eggs are already cooking?

03:21.812 --> 03:23.012
No!

03:23.379 --> 03:24.604
Oh, dammit.

03:24.639 --> 03:26.440
Listen, we have bigger
eggs to fry, okay?

03:26.474 --> 03:29.331
I gotta get out of Hawaii, so you
have to pretend to have an emergency.

03:29.356 --> 03:32.463
What? Oh, crap! I put sugar
in the eggs instead of salt.

03:33.866 --> 03:36.216
Oh, my God, that's horrible!

03:36.250 --> 03:38.308
Eh, it's not so bad. I
can probably scrape it off.

03:38.333 --> 03:40.887
No, no, that is bad! That is very bad!

03:40.922 --> 03:42.558
You should go to the emergency room!

03:42.716 --> 03:44.534
- Is everything okay?
- No!

03:45.860 --> 03:49.297
You do not have to suffer alone,
okay? I am on the next flight out.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.456
- We gotta go?
- Yes.

03:52.481 --> 03:56.352
Yes, we do. You know Sofia. Her
life is just a constant mess!

04:00.308 --> 04:01.641
Why are you leaving?

04:01.676 --> 04:03.952
It's called Flip Flops
for Lovers, not Leavers.

04:04.776 --> 04:06.757
Wish we could stay, Danny,
but the craziest thing.

04:06.782 --> 04:09.225
Gabi's best friend got bit by
a snake, so we gotta get home.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.006
Yeah. Yeah, she's in the hospital,

04:11.031 --> 04:13.153
but by the time we get there,
she'll probably be at home

04:13.187 --> 04:17.088
acting like nothing happened, but it
did happen. It did. Goodbye, Danny!

04:21.286 --> 04:22.487
Hi, Danny.

04:23.409 --> 04:25.372
I can't believe they sent
us back from the airport

04:25.397 --> 04:27.235
because of some stupid tropical storm.

04:27.260 --> 04:29.259
Yeah, poor us, stuck in Hawaii.

04:29.284 --> 04:32.647
I don't understand why we couldn't
stay at that other really nice hotel.

04:33.118 --> 04:34.654
The Airport Motor Lodge?

04:36.177 --> 04:37.444
Free HBO.

04:43.480 --> 04:47.250
Oh, I just remembered!
Sofia! I hope she's okay!

04:47.672 --> 04:48.955
Why? What happened to her?

04:50.191 --> 04:52.653
Oh, right, her spider bite.

04:53.042 --> 04:54.574
Thought you said it was a snake bite.

04:55.510 --> 04:58.570
It was a spider riding
on a snake's back.

04:59.224 --> 05:01.324
It was scary, Josh. It was very scary.

05:02.326 --> 05:05.210
Um, actually, you know what?
I'm gonna go call her right now.

05:10.551 --> 05:11.865
I thought you left!

05:11.890 --> 05:13.745
Yeah, I... I did, but I'm back now

05:13.770 --> 05:16.077
because apparently there's
some sort of weird storm coming

05:16.102 --> 05:17.534
and all the planes are grounded.

05:17.559 --> 05:20.052
- So, what are we supposed to do now?
- It's simple.

05:20.077 --> 05:22.370
You want to be with Amanda
and I want to be with Josh,

05:22.395 --> 05:24.902
so in order to make that happen, we
just have to stay away from each other

05:24.927 --> 05:26.373
for the rest of the trip. Agreed?

05:26.398 --> 05:27.598
Fine.

05:29.559 --> 05:30.912
Goodbye forever, Gabi.

05:31.202 --> 05:32.503
Goodbye forever, Adam.

05:35.339 --> 05:36.773
Hey, Gabi, come out here.

05:37.493 --> 05:38.693
No.

05:39.604 --> 05:40.904
You come in here.

05:41.406 --> 05:44.294
I'm serious. Come out here. You
gotta see how big these waves are.

05:45.810 --> 05:48.653
Oh, wow. Look at that.
So moody and mystical.

05:48.826 --> 05:51.467
Ooh, like The Hobbit! Let's
go inside and watch it!

05:51.492 --> 05:53.931
Watch a movie? We're in Hawaii.

05:53.956 --> 05:57.300
What do you mean, play
Scrabble? We're in Hawaii!

05:58.499 --> 05:59.699
Gabi?

05:59.950 --> 06:02.613
Hey, Amanda, Adam.

06:02.638 --> 06:04.310
Uh, Josh, this is...

06:04.335 --> 06:05.766
Adam from Instagram.

06:05.791 --> 06:07.869
Uh, Instagram, this is Josh from Adam.

06:07.894 --> 06:09.385
- Hey.
- Hey, Josh.

06:09.410 --> 06:11.219
- Heard a lot about ya.
- I saw a lot about you.

06:11.244 --> 06:12.645
Someone packed a selfie stick.

06:13.029 --> 06:16.216
Yes, and, uh, this is Amanda,
the girl who punched my face.

06:16.365 --> 06:19.353
I'm so sorry about that.
Adam explained everything.

06:19.579 --> 06:22.114
It's what I do, explain
complicated things.

06:23.824 --> 06:25.648
And now I know I
shouldn't have punched you.

06:25.673 --> 06:28.312
I mean, if anything, I
should be thanking you.

06:28.337 --> 06:30.111
If you and Adam hadn't
posted those pictures

06:30.136 --> 06:32.941
to make be jealous, then we never
would have gotten back together.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.368
Amanda's right. I mean, the
pictures did the same for us.

06:35.393 --> 06:37.871
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey! I just had a brilliant idea.

06:37.896 --> 06:39.333
Why don't we have
dinner together tonight?

06:39.358 --> 06:41.083
No!

06:41.481 --> 06:43.256
- Uh...
- Yeah, 'cause the thing!

06:43.281 --> 06:46.031
The thing is that actually,
uh, I... I would like to,

06:46.056 --> 06:47.957
- but, um, Josh...
- Would love to.

06:48.195 --> 06:50.126
- Oh!
- Yes, and "love" trumps "like,"

06:50.140 --> 06:52.404
so I guess we're having dinner.

06:52.429 --> 06:54.911
- Yeah, we are!
- Guys, this is great.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.956
We're all finally with the
person we're meant to be with.

06:56.981 --> 06:58.193
How about a group hug? Huh?

06:58.218 --> 07:00.318
Resort style! All
inclusive! Get over here!

07:00.343 --> 07:01.634
Oh, okay.

07:01.900 --> 07:03.100
Hey.

07:03.987 --> 07:05.190
Fun.

07:06.218 --> 07:07.986
Please! I said I was sorry!

07:08.011 --> 07:09.394
Don't talk to me.

07:09.419 --> 07:12.087
Why, if it isn't our favorite thrupple.

07:12.187 --> 07:14.202
Hope you're all having a lovely day.

07:14.227 --> 07:15.427
We are not.

07:15.452 --> 07:17.518
Oh, no. Thrupple trouble?

07:18.187 --> 07:20.442
The three of us were
swimming in the ocean.

07:20.467 --> 07:22.514
You know, as thrupples tend to do.

07:23.035 --> 07:24.302
We swam too far.

07:24.327 --> 07:26.835
We were being swallowed
by the angry sea.

07:27.442 --> 07:29.465
So naturally, I reached out

07:29.490 --> 07:31.291
to the love of my life for help,

07:31.316 --> 07:33.284
but he was already halfway to shore.

07:33.309 --> 07:35.477
- I was just trying to...
- Save yourself

07:35.502 --> 07:38.063
with no regard for the
man you supposedly love?

07:38.088 --> 07:41.857
I would've been a goner
if it wasn't for Yolanda.

07:41.882 --> 07:44.128
And my two floaties. Boop!

07:45.788 --> 07:48.527
Elliot, I'm sorry. I
barely escaped with my life.

07:48.552 --> 07:51.714
Well, you're barely going to
escape this vacation with a husband.

07:51.739 --> 07:54.661
She came back for me! And you didn't!

07:55.355 --> 07:57.232
Do you know what this means?

07:57.883 --> 08:00.381
I have to be nice to her now,

08:00.685 --> 08:03.514
and she's wearing a bathing suit!

08:07.185 --> 08:09.386
So far, this is going great.

08:09.420 --> 08:12.368
They have no clue anything
happened between us.

08:12.393 --> 08:14.906
Yes. You know what'll give 'em a clue?

08:15.055 --> 08:16.808
Talking like this.

08:17.457 --> 08:18.748
What are you guys talking about?

08:18.773 --> 08:22.212
Um, nothing. We were just wondering
what's taking so long with our table.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.143
I mean, we made a reservation for 7:00

08:24.168 --> 08:27.182
and it's already not even close to 7:00.

08:27.914 --> 08:30.640
Well, um, since we have a little time,

08:30.665 --> 08:32.106
and I have had a few drinks,

08:32.374 --> 08:34.424
there's something I've
been wanting to do.

08:35.217 --> 08:37.332
- Adam...
- What's happening?

08:38.342 --> 08:39.981
- I think she might be proposing.
- Oh!

08:40.006 --> 08:42.698
Leaving you at the altar was
the biggest mistake I ever made,

08:42.724 --> 08:44.030
and I've made a lot of them.

08:44.663 --> 08:46.502
But I never make the same mistake twice.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.423
Yup, she is definitely proposing.

08:49.356 --> 08:51.709
You're the sweetest
man I have ever known

08:51.995 --> 08:54.063
and I never want to spend
another night without you.

08:54.417 --> 08:56.808
Adam Foley, will you marry me?

08:57.135 --> 08:58.335
Again?

08:59.192 --> 09:01.609
Whoa, I did not see this coming.

09:01.634 --> 09:03.001
I did. I called it.

09:04.338 --> 09:07.586
Say something, Adam. I've never been
on my knees this long with clothes on.

09:09.889 --> 09:11.154
Amanda...

09:11.326 --> 09:13.596
ever since you left, I...
I prayed you'd come back

09:13.621 --> 09:15.156
- and say this...
- Uh-huh.

09:15.418 --> 09:17.156
but I...

09:18.132 --> 09:19.832
I can't marry you.

09:19.857 --> 09:22.247
- Not when I'm this confused.
- Confused about what?

09:22.272 --> 09:25.098
Oh, my God, look at those storm clouds!

09:25.123 --> 09:26.711
- Let's go there now!
- Wait.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.513
I may or may not have feelings for Gabi.

09:29.637 --> 09:30.866
- What?
- Nothing...

09:30.891 --> 09:32.099
- We kissed!
- What?

09:32.124 --> 09:33.324
- Nothing...
- We kissed!

09:33.525 --> 09:34.725
You kissed him?

09:34.750 --> 09:37.938
Listen, I can explain, okay?
It was just a vacation kiss!

09:37.963 --> 09:39.336
Oh, you little...

09:45.567 --> 09:48.756
Why, why, why, why?!

09:48.781 --> 09:50.223
I get that you didn't want to marry her,

09:50.248 --> 09:52.211
but why did you have to
bring my name into it?

09:52.236 --> 09:54.036
I had to be honest, Gabi.

09:54.061 --> 09:57.301
Well, thanks for dragging me
into your tangled web of truth!

09:58.944 --> 10:00.111
So...

10:00.136 --> 10:01.769
you don't have any feelings for me?

10:01.794 --> 10:03.625
Ugh! It was a vacation kiss!

10:03.651 --> 10:05.694
What the hell is a vacation kiss anyway?

10:07.055 --> 10:09.156
It's an excuse is what it is.

10:09.317 --> 10:11.384
- Here, I got you some ice.
- Thanks.

10:15.868 --> 10:17.427
For your face.

10:18.769 --> 10:20.170
You know, I knew something was up.

10:20.204 --> 10:22.305
Gabi was acting strange
ever since I got here.

10:22.642 --> 10:24.677
Spiders don't ride on
the backs of snakes!

10:26.043 --> 10:28.943
You know, Adam said those Instagram
photos of them doing fun things

10:28.968 --> 10:30.985
was just to make us jealous, but...

10:31.010 --> 10:32.720
Maybe when we were doing
all those fun things

10:32.745 --> 10:34.600
together, we just got
caught up in the moment.

10:34.795 --> 10:38.597
Or, alternative theory,
maybe it was fate.

10:38.871 --> 10:40.429
Us being on that plane together,

10:40.454 --> 10:42.849
Josh kissing that doctor,
you trying to leave

10:42.874 --> 10:45.022
and then being forced to come
back because of the hurricane.

10:45.047 --> 10:47.124
Oh, you know what drink
we should order next?

10:47.149 --> 10:48.483
Hurricane.

10:49.601 --> 10:52.603
See, Gabi? We have something special.

10:52.836 --> 10:54.736
Maybe we were meant to be together.

10:54.845 --> 10:57.213
No, I'm meant to be with Josh.

10:57.238 --> 11:00.054
- I thought I was meant to be with Gabi.
- I thought I was meant to be with Adam.

11:00.079 --> 11:01.281
Really?

11:01.306 --> 11:04.001
- Why'd you ditch him at the altar?
- Why'd you kiss your therapist?

11:04.795 --> 11:06.452
Yeah, Adam told me.

11:07.837 --> 11:09.587
Oh, my God. You're right.

11:10.287 --> 11:11.955
We are horrible people.

11:13.246 --> 11:14.446
You know what I wish?

11:14.728 --> 11:16.681
I just wish things would go
back to the way they were,

11:16.706 --> 11:19.603
when I liked Josh and he liked
me, and everything was simple.

11:19.628 --> 11:21.796
- Gabi?
- Josh?

11:21.821 --> 11:23.088
I've been an idiot.

11:23.113 --> 11:25.528
Oh, thank God you realized it!

11:32.805 --> 11:34.172
Elliot, let it go.

11:34.197 --> 11:36.265
We all made mistakes out there.

11:36.290 --> 11:38.091
Alan didn't save you.

11:38.116 --> 11:39.568
And I did.

11:40.909 --> 11:44.897
Alan keeps claiming that he
thought I was right behind him.

11:45.096 --> 11:47.839
Trust me, he knows when I'm behind him.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.706
There's the love of my life!

11:51.229 --> 11:52.720
Elliot, please.

11:52.745 --> 11:55.313
- We need to talk about what happened.
- Yolanda...

11:55.338 --> 12:00.138
did you hear something... like the whiny
voice of someone who left you to die?

12:03.321 --> 12:05.194
Elliot, this is ridiculous.

12:05.219 --> 12:07.742
Are you really gonna ignore me
the whole rest of our honeymoon?

12:10.610 --> 12:12.304
Oh, that's real mature, Elliot.

12:12.329 --> 12:14.122
You know, when we got
married, we promised each other

12:14.147 --> 12:15.602
we would always communicate.

12:17.074 --> 12:19.108
Oh, so now we're playing charades?

12:19.133 --> 12:21.791
I make you nauseous? Well,
let me tell you something.

12:21.816 --> 12:24.156
I have been so sick since
this whole thing happened,

12:24.181 --> 12:26.124
I have not been able to eat.

12:26.149 --> 12:28.378
With the exception of that
smoked fish on a bagel!

12:29.453 --> 12:31.960
Oh, my damn, is he choking?!

12:31.985 --> 12:33.539
Oh, my God, what's happening?

12:36.953 --> 12:38.554
Oh, Yolanda.

12:39.362 --> 12:40.888
You saved my life.

12:41.836 --> 12:43.434
Again.

12:45.555 --> 12:47.573
Thanks a lot, Yolanda.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.491
I'm sorry.

12:49.526 --> 12:51.371
It's my maternal instincts.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.919
If I see a fat, little
baby choking, I gotta help.

13:00.592 --> 13:02.560
Finally we get to be together.

13:02.585 --> 13:04.386
Just the two of us alone.

13:04.411 --> 13:06.140
No interruptions, no Adam.

13:06.165 --> 13:08.541
Just you and me in
Hawaii, the most magical...

13:08.566 --> 13:09.766
- Josh?
- Yes?

13:09.791 --> 13:11.516
Do you remember when I told you
I wanted you to take it slow?

13:11.525 --> 13:12.725
- Yeah.
- Don't.

13:14.624 --> 13:17.991
Attention, lovers, Tropical
storm Olivia has been upgraded

13:18.016 --> 13:19.218
- to a hurricane.
- Huh.

13:19.243 --> 13:21.118
Please immediately
come down to the lobby

13:21.143 --> 13:23.631
and pick up an emergency kit
in case of a power outage.

13:23.656 --> 13:25.991
Hey! Hey! You know what I'm thinkin'?

13:26.250 --> 13:27.648
I should get us a kit.

13:27.784 --> 13:29.683
Seriously? Right now?

13:29.708 --> 13:31.692
Gabi, I am wrestling with
two very primal urges,

13:31.717 --> 13:33.868
and survival is winning by
a hair. I'll be right back.

13:40.098 --> 13:41.774
Gabi, it's me! Adam!

13:41.799 --> 13:42.999
Adam!

13:43.024 --> 13:45.414
What are you doing out there?
There's a hurricane outside!

13:45.439 --> 13:47.399
Yeah, I know. Let me in!

13:47.424 --> 13:48.947
No, go to your own room!

13:48.972 --> 13:51.971
I can't! I tried to make up with
Amanda, but she just screamed at me

13:51.996 --> 13:53.440
and locked me out on the terrace!

13:54.318 --> 13:55.518
Okay.

13:55.543 --> 13:56.809
Listen, I am really sorry about

13:56.834 --> 13:58.674
you and Amanda, but this
is a really bad time, okay?

13:58.699 --> 14:00.100
Josh is gonna be back any second!

14:00.125 --> 14:03.226
I get it, but I'm freezing! Can I
have maybe one of those plush robes?

14:07.261 --> 14:08.830
Here. Okay, now go.

14:08.855 --> 14:10.218
Go, go, go, go go, go, go, go.

14:11.411 --> 14:12.878
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay!

14:12.903 --> 14:14.406
Get under the bed! Get under the bed!

14:18.043 --> 14:19.638
Wow, you are so fast.

14:19.663 --> 14:21.720
That is the only time you'll
be saying that tonight.

14:22.341 --> 14:23.543
Now where were we?

14:23.568 --> 14:24.950
Where were we? Yes, where were we?

14:24.975 --> 14:26.697
Um... Hey, hey, wait a minute!

14:27.177 --> 14:28.439
You only got one kit?

14:28.779 --> 14:30.379
Yeah, it's one kit per room.

14:30.404 --> 14:32.521
Yeah, but, uh, what if
something happens to that kit?

14:32.546 --> 14:34.975
Don't we... don't we need a
backup kit? Go get a backup kit.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.140
Gabi, you didn't even want a kit.

14:38.411 --> 14:42.107
Of course I did! Who... who
doesn't love kits? I love kits!

14:42.132 --> 14:44.968
I have always wanted kits.
I want at least two kits.

14:45.907 --> 14:48.268
You know what? I'm even
looking forward to grand kits.

14:50.001 --> 14:51.201
What's happening?

14:52.181 --> 14:53.548
Adam's under the bed.

14:53.690 --> 14:54.890
What?

14:56.617 --> 14:59.086
Uh... no, he's not.

14:59.782 --> 15:00.982
He's not?

15:01.951 --> 15:04.057
He's not. Where did he go?

15:04.964 --> 15:06.464
- I'm right here.
- Whoa!

15:07.936 --> 15:10.332
- Wait, what... what is going on?
- Okay, listen,

15:10.357 --> 15:11.654
- he got in a fight with Amanda...
- Amanda and I had a fight...

15:11.679 --> 15:13.083
- and I saw him on the terrace, and it's
- She locked me out onto the terrace,

15:13.108 --> 15:14.631
- raining and it got really cold, so...
- I didn't know where else to go, so...

15:14.656 --> 15:15.856
Stop!

15:17.193 --> 15:19.422
Josh, I swear it was all innocent.

15:20.696 --> 15:22.248
Just like your Instagram posts.

15:24.462 --> 15:26.029
- Uh...
- I should've known.

15:29.611 --> 15:31.111
Oh, my God.

15:31.527 --> 15:34.174
Why does this not surprise me?

15:40.345 --> 15:44.288
Attention, Flip Floppers, Hurricane
Olivia has turned into a real bitch.

15:44.684 --> 15:47.309
She is now a category four
and all guests are to take

15:47.334 --> 15:49.100
immediate shelter in the basement.

15:50.576 --> 15:51.966
Where's Elliot?

15:51.991 --> 15:55.252
Who cares? There's a hurricane! I
don't want it to blow my wig off!

15:55.277 --> 15:57.573
No! I'm not gonna leave him, Yolanda!

15:57.598 --> 16:00.549
Oh, there are speakers everywhere!
He heard the announcement!

16:00.574 --> 16:03.355
No! I have failed him too many
times! I'm not gonna leave him now!

16:03.380 --> 16:04.674
- Save yourself, Yolanda!
- Okay!

16:04.699 --> 16:05.992
This is my moment!

16:08.043 --> 16:09.243
My moment!

16:09.268 --> 16:10.966
My moment!

16:10.991 --> 16:12.191
Go!

16:13.583 --> 16:14.783
Josh?

16:15.552 --> 16:16.752
Josh?

16:17.921 --> 16:19.121
Josh?

16:22.501 --> 16:23.772
Josh?

16:24.157 --> 16:25.357
Gabi!

16:25.382 --> 16:27.624
It's not safe out here! Go back inside!

16:27.649 --> 16:29.407
Don't tell me what to do! I fi...

16:29.578 --> 16:30.945
Aah!

16:31.306 --> 16:33.579
You know, you can be as mad as you want,

16:33.604 --> 16:35.493
but for your information,
I've been trying to

16:35.518 --> 16:36.975
make us work since you got here!

16:37.000 --> 16:38.200
Oh, yeah, I can see that!

16:38.225 --> 16:40.920
Well, if you would've stayed in the room
instead of running out all dramatic,

16:40.945 --> 16:43.218
- you would've seen that!
- I saw enough, Gabi!

16:43.243 --> 16:46.307
You know, you keep blaming me, but I...

16:46.332 --> 16:47.699
You're the one who came here all,

16:47.724 --> 16:49.428
"I'm ready! Let's get a room!"

16:49.453 --> 16:51.898
I mean, did you ever think
about what I wanted? Aah!

16:51.923 --> 16:53.526
That's all I've thought about!

16:53.551 --> 16:55.085
I thought this was what you wanted!

16:55.110 --> 16:57.336
Oh, I'll tell you what I want!

16:57.361 --> 16:58.561
Gabi!

16:59.527 --> 17:01.765
Elliot, are you in here?

17:02.736 --> 17:05.800
Elliot! Oh, God! My angel!

17:06.894 --> 17:08.227
I'll save you.

17:08.252 --> 17:11.318
I may not have saved you in the
ocean or with that pineapple,

17:11.343 --> 17:14.017
but I'll be damned if I
lose you to a palm tree!

17:14.041 --> 17:15.476
I love you!

17:15.771 --> 17:17.568
I love you too!

17:18.147 --> 17:19.381
Danny?

17:19.406 --> 17:21.554
I was checking all the rooms for guests,

17:21.579 --> 17:23.075
and then suddenly I came out here

17:23.099 --> 17:25.167
and these fronds came down on me!

17:25.193 --> 17:26.724
I thought I was dead.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.384
You saved my life!

17:31.286 --> 17:32.486
Wow.

17:32.511 --> 17:35.558
I never noticed it before, but
you and Elliot are like twins.

17:35.583 --> 17:38.051
Wait, where's Elliot?
Where's my husband?

17:38.771 --> 17:43.741
You know, if they can't find his body
and you need a shoulder to cry on...

17:43.766 --> 17:45.767
Back off, bitch!

17:48.337 --> 17:50.862
Elliot! You're okay!

17:51.046 --> 17:53.204
I was in the bathroom when
I heard the announcement,

17:53.229 --> 17:55.352
so I panicked and hid in the tub!

17:55.807 --> 17:58.050
I can't believe you
came up here to save me.

17:58.075 --> 18:01.319
Of course I did! I would do
anything in the world for you

18:01.344 --> 18:03.779
except, you know, ocean stuff.

18:04.573 --> 18:06.309
My hero.

18:06.976 --> 18:09.125
Twins? Really?

18:12.010 --> 18:14.681
I think we should try
to make it back inside!

18:14.706 --> 18:17.585
No! We should stay out
here and wait the storm out!

18:17.610 --> 18:19.411
No, I think we can make it!

18:19.883 --> 18:21.083
Gabi!

18:21.690 --> 18:23.018
Oh, okay!

18:23.337 --> 18:24.753
We can't make it!

18:24.778 --> 18:27.313
- All right!
- Might as well just keep fighting here!

18:32.387 --> 18:33.587
Better?

18:33.612 --> 18:35.914
Much! Thank you!

18:35.939 --> 18:38.307
Josh, you wanna know why I kissed Adam?

18:38.332 --> 18:39.635
Don't wanna know!

18:39.911 --> 18:41.979
Because we were having fun!

18:42.522 --> 18:45.672
You know, we weren't
breaking each other's hearts!

18:45.697 --> 18:48.984
I wasn't getting on planes and
seeing him with other women!

18:49.009 --> 18:51.711
I wasn't screaming at him
in the middle of a hurricane!

18:51.984 --> 18:55.726
It was simple! It was fun! Which
is the exact opposite of us!

18:55.751 --> 18:57.577
Oh, come on, Gabi! We have tons of fun!

18:57.602 --> 18:58.802
When?

18:59.115 --> 19:02.297
Uh, how about that time we, uh...

19:03.460 --> 19:06.248
That time we sang the Tegan
and Sara song together!

19:06.273 --> 19:09.209
You mean the first day
we met two years ago?

19:09.234 --> 19:11.336
Yeah, and then we slept together

19:11.361 --> 19:13.408
and you proposed to a
different girl the next day!

19:13.433 --> 19:14.866
Fun, Josh! Real fun!

19:15.003 --> 19:17.827
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying this isn't fun!

19:17.852 --> 19:20.063
- This is a nightmare!
- Oh, come on, Gabi!

19:22.781 --> 19:25.763
All right, fine! This is a nightmare!

19:25.788 --> 19:28.236
See? Whenever we're together,
all hell breaks loose!

19:28.261 --> 19:30.177
Well, then maybe we
shouldn't be together!

19:38.533 --> 19:39.733
Are we dead?

19:42.484 --> 19:43.818
Yeah, I think we are.

19:47.342 --> 19:49.647
Why does everybody
think Hawaii is so great?

19:52.116 --> 19:54.536
So, you and Josh aren't
in a relationship,

19:54.561 --> 19:56.715
you're no longer friends,
and you don't have a job?

19:57.812 --> 19:59.725
And we haven't had sex...

20:00.373 --> 20:01.924
in two years.

20:04.146 --> 20:06.504
Gabi, why is that funny, like, at all?

20:06.529 --> 20:08.793
Because you know how this works, Sofia.

20:08.818 --> 20:13.473
Every time Josh and I get in a big
fight and I quit or he fires me,

20:13.498 --> 20:14.989
one of us always comes crawling back.

20:15.014 --> 20:17.715
So, I'm laughing
because I know he's gonna

20:17.740 --> 20:19.637
knock on that door any second now.

20:21.277 --> 20:22.487
Any second.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.257
Okay, Sofia.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.023
Pour another cup.

20:29.048 --> 20:31.756
Josh is gonna be coming over any minute.

20:33.493 --> 20:37.435
Hey, get another glass for
Josh, Sofia, because, uh...

20:39.128 --> 20:40.442
He's not coming, is he?

20:41.231 --> 20:42.431
No.

20:43.252 --> 20:44.619
No, he's not.
