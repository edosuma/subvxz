It's impossible
to fumble the ball...

20:21.976 --> 20:24.229
when the quarterback has
the proper hand placement.

20:24.312 --> 20:27.107
It's weird to think of a woman
being sexually attracted to Dad.

20:27.190 --> 20:30.944
No, you wanna hear weird? Cam
said he'd pick up Dad at a gay bar.

20:31.069 --> 20:34.239
Ooh. How did that come up?
Mmm, I'm really trying to block it out.

20:34.322 --> 20:36.467
As far as I'm concerned,
Mom and Dad had sex two times.

20:36.491 --> 20:38.410
[Clicking Tongue]
Agreed.

20:38.493 --> 20:41.329
<i>Okay, get your hands up there
like you're lifting me off the ground.</i>

20:41.413 --> 20:43.790
Be one with me, Jay.
There you go.

20:43.915 --> 20:47.377
Do you wanna get something
to eat? I am never eating again.

20:47.460 --> 20:49.212
Just snap the damn thing.

20:49.295 --> 20:52.382
[Cameron ] Perfect.
That one kinda hurt.

20:57.262 --> 20:58.263
