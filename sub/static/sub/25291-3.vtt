00:49.640 --> 00:51.107
(Chatter)

00:59.480 --> 01:01.027
R055: October 5th.

01:01.200 --> 01:04.419
My dearest Deme/za,
though I must confess to some trepidaﬁon

01:04.600 --> 01:06.579
at my ﬁrst foray
into the House of Commons,

01:06.760 --> 01:09.581
I am resolved to begin
what] came here to do.

01:09.760 --> 01:11.546
(Murmur of conversation)

01:22.080 --> 01:23.820
DEMELZ4: November 20th.

01:24.000 --> 01:28.983
My dearest Ross, today we ,o/oughed the long
field and brought in the last of the app/es.

01:30.240 --> 01:32.424
- (Raised voices)
SPEAKER: Order, gentlemen!

01:32.600 --> 01:35.580
ROSS: There are, Mr Speaker...
- Order! Order!

01:35.760 --> 01:42.507
There are, in England, 160 crimes
for which a man may be hanged.

01:42.680 --> 01:45.103
- (Shouting and clamouring)
- Order!

01:47.680 --> 01:49.341
DEMELZ4.’ January 27th.

01:49.520 --> 01:50.862
My dearest Ross,

01:51.040 --> 01:54.703
Christmas is already behind us,
yet the harsh winter persists

01:54.880 --> 01:58.941
and all of us at home, and at the mine,
eagerly await your return.

02:00.400 --> 02:01.981
R055: March 3rd.

02:02.160 --> 02:03.741
My
dearest Demelza,

02:03.920 --> 02:08.744
the contentious anti-s/a very debate rages on,
keeping me here to add my support.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.501
In my continued absence,

02:10.680 --> 02:13.945
I know I can rely on you to manage
aﬁ‘airs gt home
little longer.

02:14.800 --> 02:18.679
Gentlemen, much as I commend
the bill proposed

02:18.840 --> 02:20.979
by my Right Honourable friend
Mr Wilberforce,

02:21.160 --> 02:26.780
and suggest that arguments
in favour of slavery are abominable...

02:26.960 --> 02:31.147
- (Cries of dissent)
- ..| submit that there is suffering and injustice

02:31.320 --> 02:35.745
_ closer _to home _
which also reqUIres our attention.

02:36.560 --> 02:43.068
Children employed in the mills of the North
are dying in their thousands of overwork!

02:43.240 --> 02:45.617
Order! Order! Order!

02:45.800 --> 02:48.507
Where is our compassion for these slaves?

02:48.680 --> 02:51.581
- (Angry shouting)
- Order! Order!

02:53.240 --> 02:55.219
The House will come to order!

03:20.680 --> 03:23.467
- Good day, Rosina.
- Good day, Mistress.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.940
Good day, Master Drake.

03:35.880 --> 03:38.098
What did Cap'n Ross say in his letter?

03:39.400 --> 03:43.177
Oh, just that he misses us very much
and will return as soon as he can.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.979
Come on, then, you two.

03:52.280 --> 03:54.737
VERITY: It's so lovely to be at Trenwith again.

03:54.920 --> 03:57.502
ELIZABETH: My clear,
this was your home before it was ours.

03:57.680 --> 04:01.184
You must visit whenever you choose.
Mustn't she, George?

04:02.360 --> 04:05.420
Elizabeth will be glad of your company
while I'm away in London.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.865
And if you'll excuse me,
I must prepare for my departure.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.544
- Will you visit Nampara?
- Oh, yes.

04:17.320 --> 04:19.629
Of course, not all the family are in residence.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.267
No.

04:24.040 --> 04:26.304
I imagine George misses Westminster.

04:27.160 --> 04:30.539
- And has every intention of returning.
- By challenging Ross?

04:31.440 --> 04:33.704
I believe he means to try
a different approach.

04:49.240 --> 04:54.109
Marshmallow root, brewed with cooled water,
thrice daily while the throat is raw.

04:54.280 --> 04:56.919
And might I suggest
a reduced consumption of rum?

04:57.520 --> 05:00.227
Feel free to suggest all you like!

05:00.880 --> 05:04.099
(Clears throat)
Do we hear aught from his Lordship,

05:04.280 --> 05:06.145
the Honourable Member for Truro?

05:06.320 --> 05:09.426
Or be he now too grand for the likes 0' we?

05:09.600 --> 05:11.545
Why not ask his Lordship's wife?

05:15.840 --> 05:18.263
- Good day to you, sir. How's your wife?
- She's well.

05:18.440 --> 05:19.907
Good.

05:20.880 --> 05:22.381
Tholly. Mrs Crocker.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.224
Come on, then, my handsome-looking lass.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.547
- (He chuckles)
- Ohh!

05:29.400 --> 05:31.265
Dr Enys, have you escaped?

05:31.440 --> 05:34.500
- And Mrs Enys so near her time?
- She's still refusing to rest

05:34.680 --> 05:38.559
and proceeding as if nothing is happening
and nothing will change.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.259
Well, Captain, anything to report?

05:42.080 --> 05:44.059
There is, ma'am.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.342
And not good.

05:48.600 --> 05:51.387
The champion lode's wearing unexpected thin.

05:52.240 --> 05:57.303
It looked safe for nigh on five or more years,
but now, if it peter out as we think it will...

05:57.480 --> 05:59.539
We might have to close within months.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.504
I think I must write to Ross.

06:08.840 --> 06:11.422
But what can he do?
And at such a distance?

06:11.600 --> 06:13.784
With greater matters than we to busy hisself.

06:13.960 --> 06:15.222
I'll write to him.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.581
(Crowd gasps)

06:55.600 --> 06:57.579
- Ooh!
- (Ribald laughter)

07:00.840 --> 07:02.421
(Crowd gasps and claps)

07:03.240 --> 07:05.219
(Fireworks fizzing)

07:10.040 --> 07:12.019
(Cheering and clapping)

07:16.080 --> 07:18.640
- Uncle Ross!
- Geoffrey Charles.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.062
I hear you're quite the clbrit in Westminster.

07:22.240 --> 07:25.141
On the contrary, I think I'm seen
as a thoroughgoing nuisance.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.026
Papa would have enjoyed your speech.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.304
Your father would have graced the House

07:29.480 --> 07:32.426
with more dignity
and less notoriety than I can muster.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.499
A toast, then.

07:37.840 --> 07:40.502
- To Francis Poldark!
- And his son.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.979
(Woman laughs nearby)

07:49.720 --> 07:51.904
Fame has its rewards.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.105
ROSS: May I offer you some refreshment?

07:59.840 --> 08:03.105
Oh, but we thought to offer you some, my Lord.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.019
Another time, perhaps?

08:18.160 --> 08:19.707
Pit)'-

08:50.600 --> 08:52.579
(Bell tolling)

08:54.520 --> 08:56.021
Poldark.

08:56.720 --> 09:00.497
The drawbacks of being a Cornish MP
who actually lives in Cornwall.

09:00.680 --> 09:03.342
One cannot simply dash home
when the need arises.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.579
- I take it the need has arisen?
- Yes.

09:06.680 --> 09:11.800
Matters_of state can sometimes be
a useful distraction if one is so inclined.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.903
My nephew.

09:17.080 --> 09:18.149
Yes?

09:19.040 --> 09:22.624
Has been very much in my thoughts.
He would have served his constituency well.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.429
And would have urged you not to serve it
at the expense of your wife and family.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.979
WAITER: Your table, sir.

09:42.280 --> 09:45.864
Captain Monk Adderley,
Right Honourable Member for Bishop's Castle -

09:46.520 --> 09:49.466
a place I've never seen, nor ever intend to.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.427
How may I assist you?

10:20.720 --> 10:23.029
(Birdsong and distant laughter)

10:23.800 --> 10:25.347
And how has it been without Ross?

10:25.520 --> 10:27.863
Ross? Ross? Do we know any Ross?

10:28.040 --> 10:29.302
(Laughter)

10:29.480 --> 10:31.345
-(Dogb
.. ark
Ooh! S)

10:31.520 --> 10:33.499
CHILD: He's coming!
- (Laughter)

10:37.120 --> 10:38.587
(Winces)

10:39.880 --> 10:42.622
Not yet, my dear, but you very soon will be.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.188
Caroline?

10:44.360 --> 10:45.907
The carriage?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.104
LADY WHITWORTH: Where is my grandson?

10:51.960 --> 10:53.063
(Door opens)

10:56.640 --> 11:00.383
Good heavens, why is that child playing
when he could be learning his numbers?

11:00.560 --> 11:04.462
He is a Whitworth.
Great things are required of him.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.467
Where is my son?

11:09.640 --> 11:11.505
(Horses' hooves clomping)

11:16.360 --> 11:18.225
Ha! Poldark!

11:18.400 --> 11:19.788
How was Westminster?

11:19.960 --> 11:23.782
Abolition of slavery, Catholic Emancipation
and all that nonsense?

11:24.800 --> 11:29.419
Why have you not engaged a governess?
No matter. I shall find a suitable person.

11:29.600 --> 11:33.058
It is never too soon to shape
impressionable young minds.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.228
He's barely two years old.

11:35.400 --> 11:39.746
And you are a child...
and have no notion of how the world works.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.304
Tell my son I will arrange everything.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.862
By the by, perhaps you could use
your good offices on my behalf?

11:51.600 --> 11:53.261
I'm seeking the living of Luxulyan.

11:53.440 --> 11:55.305
You already have two livings.

11:55.480 --> 11:59.780
Ah, but they're miserably poor
and not at all befitting a man of my station.

11:59.960 --> 12:03.100
And, in return, I might do you a favour.

12:03.280 --> 12:08.661
My uncle, Conan Godolphin,
is a personal friend of the Prince of Wales.

12:08.840 --> 12:13.140
Your curate-in-charge at St Sawle,
Reverend Odgers,

12:13.320 --> 12:18.519
is a hard-working father of six
who earns 45 a year.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.147
An enormous sum!

12:20.320 --> 12:22.220
I cannot conceit how he spends it all.

12:22.400 --> 12:26.939
I could be willing to intercede on your behalf
if you increase Odgers' stipend to 100 a year.

12:27.120 --> 12:31.227
Good God! Do you realise the total stipend
from Sawle is only 200?

12:31.400 --> 12:33.823
Why would I pay half to an uneducated curate?

12:34.440 --> 12:36.226
Because he does all the work.

12:39.720 --> 12:40.857
(Heavy thud)

12:41.040 --> 12:44.385
This is not one of our native plants.
How came you by it?

12:45.720 --> 12:50.066
'Tis a magnolia. It was given by a friend -
a Lieutenant Armitage.

12:50.240 --> 12:52.299
Oh, Ross's friend who sadly died?

12:53.920 --> 12:55.899
Yes. Sadly, he.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.339
Trenwith is very grand these days.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.140
Of course, you never go there now.

13:05.320 --> 13:06.821
Were you pleased with Lisbon?

13:07.880 --> 13:11.987
And the connection will not be improved
by Ross taking George's seat.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.946
How long do you remain in Cornwall?

13:14.120 --> 13:16.259
I see this is a forbidden subject.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.867
Have you met Rosina?
This is my cousin, Verity.

13:20.040 --> 13:21.257
Good day to 'ee, ma'am.

13:21.440 --> 13:24.079
I've asked Rosina to make
caps and bonnets for the children.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.617
I hope to have 'em ready Sunday.
Shall I bring 'em over?

13:26.800 --> 13:28.779
That'd be most convenient.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.101
Amiable girl.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.739
And my brother Drake still unwed.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.744
I would've thought,
after your experience with me,

13:37.920 --> 13:39.660
you'd have had your fill of match-making.

13:39.840 --> 13:42.183
Not at all! See how well that worked out.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.021
(Verity chuckles)

13:44.760 --> 13:47.547
MONK ADDERLEY:
You did well to secure this property.

13:47.720 --> 13:48.789
GEORGE: Thank you.

13:48.960 --> 13:52.464
- Your wife is a Chynoweth.
- One of Cornwall's oldest families.

13:54.040 --> 13:55.905
I myself am a commoner,

13:56.080 --> 14:00.062
who by dint of my own ingenuity
have risen to the verge of aristocracy.

14:01.160 --> 14:05.187
I need to know I'm dealing with a man
who is equally serious about his own ascent.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.581
He is. You are.

14:11.120 --> 14:14.226
For, as you know, it is not what one knows...

14:16.880 --> 14:22.261
However...any such introductions
would come at a price.

14:23.040 --> 14:25.224
Which I am fully prepared to meet.

14:26.840 --> 14:30.185
And I applaud your desire
for a speedy return to the House.

14:32.600 --> 14:36.058
But perhaps you've had enough
of seeking a patron.

14:37.800 --> 14:41.304
Perhaps you'd prefer
to be a patron...yourself.

15:11.880 --> 15:13.666
You look...

15:16.280 --> 15:17.907
...thinner.

15:18.080 --> 15:19.980
Perhaps I've been pining for my husband.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.787
(Ross chuckles)

15:23.240 --> 15:26.459
So...what have you been up to?

15:31.000 --> 15:33.787
Well, seeing to your mine, to your farm,

15:33.960 --> 15:36.099
your household, your children.

15:37.640 --> 15:39.187
That's what I've been "up to".

15:44.440 --> 15:47.341
All the way home...
I wondered how this would be.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.579
Would there be anger, jealousy?

15:54.240 --> 15:55.946
Would we ever laugh again...

15:58.120 --> 15:59.826
...like we used to?

16:03.160 --> 16:05.139
I don't know, Ross.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.867
Will we?

16:26.480 --> 16:28.345
Get down, boy.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.785
There we go.

16:32.960 --> 16:34.382
Mm.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.460
Lay another place for supper.

16:36.640 --> 16:38.619
- Why, '00 be comin'?
- (Footsteps)

16:38.800 --> 16:40.267
lam.

16:40.440 --> 16:42.579
- Oh, Lord save us!
- (Children clamour)

16:42.760 --> 16:44.739
Oh, Master Ross!

16:51.240 --> 16:53.219
(Water dripping)

17:17.200 --> 17:18.781
What an odious journey!

17:18.960 --> 17:23.101
Obliged to share a coach
with that impudent squireen Ross Poldark!

17:24.160 --> 17:25.946
- Lady Whitworth called.
- Mama?

17:26.120 --> 17:27.906
Did I miss her?

17:28.680 --> 17:31.547
Did she mention a governess for John Conan?

17:31.720 --> 17:35.178
- I think it an excellent idea.
- Osborne, he is an infant!

17:35.360 --> 17:37.624
And I'm perfectly capable
of caring for him myself.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.461
I think not.

17:39.640 --> 17:42.382
Recollect how you made threats
against his life.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.903
You know very well why.

17:47.120 --> 17:49.384
Seeking to deny me my conjugal rights,

17:49.560 --> 17:53.940
your fevered imagination conjured up
some fantastical tale about your sister,

17:54.120 --> 17:56.702
whom I loathe and detest with every ounce of...

18:05.480 --> 18:08.620
ROM/ELLA: Dear l/icar,
when I left your house to many Arthur,

18:08.800 --> 18:11.382
I inadvertent/y carried away
some books of yours.

18:11.560 --> 18:15.064
Could I ask you, at your convenience,
to call and collect them?

18:16.320 --> 18:21.826
Arthur is at the library until five each day...
but I am always at home in the afternoons...

18:29.360 --> 18:33.421
Old Nat Pearce - my attorney - riddled with gout.

18:34.040 --> 18:37.737
- Will I come and pray with him?
- I'm sure you'll be a comfort.

18:42.720 --> 18:45.143
- (She gasps for breath)
- (Baby cries)

18:46.720 --> 18:49.700
Good Lord, Dr Enys, has it started already?

18:49.880 --> 18:51.268
Yes!

18:51.960 --> 18:53.939
She...has started already.

18:54.640 --> 18:56.187
Is she as ugly as we feared?

18:56.360 --> 18:59.909
Quite possibly the most perfect creature
I've ever seen.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.145
Does she have blue eyes?

19:03.320 --> 19:05.424
All babies have blue eyes.

19:05.600 --> 19:08.706
- Like her father?
- I'm afraid so.

19:16.120 --> 19:19.021
Then I suppose I must learn to tolerate her.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.986
What shall we call you?

19:22.040 --> 19:25.783
Miss Sarah Caroline Enys.

19:37.440 --> 19:39.419
(Knock at door)

19:43.880 --> 19:47.941
Notwithstanding your generosity
in enabling Arthur and I to marry,

19:48.120 --> 19:50.782
I'm afraid we do still
struggle to make ends meet.

19:51.720 --> 19:55.907
If only there was something I could do
to augment our meagre income.

19:57.520 --> 20:01.183
Something I could...turn my hand to.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.342
(He gulPs)

20:14.440 --> 20:15.941
How is Captain Blarney?

20:16.120 --> 20:19.260
Well. I thank you. He sends his regards.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.703
That's kind of him...considering.

20:25.280 --> 20:27.259
Andrew is not a vengeful man.

20:28.440 --> 20:30.419
But in matters of the heart,

20:30.600 --> 20:34.377
he does not hold with interference
from those who think they know better.

20:35.440 --> 20:36.987
Myself...

20:37.160 --> 20:39.583
in your case...and Morwenna's?

20:41.480 --> 20:44.142
Ray Penvenen in Caroline's?

20:45.800 --> 20:48.382
And your mother in yours?

20:51.720 --> 20:56.464
How different might so many lives have been...
without such interference?

20:59.120 --> 21:03.989
Let us vow, in future,
to let nature take its course.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.223
Agreed.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.379
We seem like strangers now.

21:33.320 --> 21:35.424
We were strangers before I left.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.419
And not of my...

21:40.320 --> 21:42.299
D?

21:43.160 --> 21:45.060
But of mine?

21:48.480 --> 21:51.267
And that's what
you've been thinking all this time,

21:51.440 --> 21:53.499
that I've been grieving for Hugh?

21:55.520 --> 21:56.908
Have you not?

21:57.720 --> 22:00.427
'Tis all past, Ross. Done with.

22:02.120 --> 22:05.465
But you left for London,
so I'd no chance to tell you so.

22:06.600 --> 22:07.988
Then you kept away.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.902
It seemed easier to fight a shade from afar.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.120
And all these months -
the distance...

22:17.600 --> 22:19.306
...the mistrust...

22:32.080 --> 22:34.105
I think you no longer know me, Ross.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.184
Perhaps we no longer know each other.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.786
(Birdsong)

23:16.800 --> 23:18.586
Tell me of London.

23:19.480 --> 23:23.143
Loud...and hectic.

23:24.120 --> 23:25.906
And your life there?

23:26.440 --> 23:28.943
Pampered and decadent.

23:29.120 --> 23:30.257
(Exhales)

23:30.440 --> 23:35.059
- See how soft and fat I've become?
- (Chuckles) On the contrary!

23:42.680 --> 23:44.341
Where are you going?

23:44.520 --> 23:46.499
To prove to myself how unfit I am.

23:54.080 --> 23:55.741
(Waves crashing)

24:09.120 --> 24:10.542
Dwight?

24:19.080 --> 24:20.945
DWIGHT: This is intolerable!

24:21.600 --> 24:24.342
Can a man not have an ocean to himself
now and then?

24:24.520 --> 24:25.839
Is this your custom now?

24:26.480 --> 24:28.425
Only on days when I become a father!

24:33.240 --> 24:35.026
That's tremendous!

24:36.160 --> 24:38.537
- Son or daughter?
- Sarah.

24:39.960 --> 24:41.222
And so it begins.

24:41.400 --> 24:43.379
Life's greatest adventure?

24:44.560 --> 24:46.425
I think you need a drink!

24:46.600 --> 24:48.579
(Both chuckle)

24:57.360 --> 24:58.748
Mm.

25:06.040 --> 25:07.905
I must be feeling my age.

25:08.080 --> 25:10.719
For the first time in my life, I feel the cold.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.586
How is Demelza?

25:13.320 --> 25:15.459
- Thawing.
- (Chuckles)

25:15.640 --> 25:16.959
I'm relieved.

25:17.120 --> 25:19.907
I know there were difficult times before you left.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.979
Hopefully they're now behind us.

25:24.280 --> 25:26.259
(Low chatter)

25:29.800 --> 25:31.904
Widow Crocker's got hold of him.

25:32.600 --> 25:34.147
Zacky. Paul.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.299
- Thol.
- Ahh!

25:38.920 --> 25:40.308
Cap'n.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.307
Good day to you, sir.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.220
Good day.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.425
(Tholly chuckles)

25:50.600 --> 25:53.706
The Right Honourable Cap'n-ness.

25:53.880 --> 25:57.304
Right, you'll be wishin' to go below, then.
Paul, show Cap'n Ross the way.

25:57.480 --> 26:00.222
I think I know how to find my own mine.

26:09.200 --> 26:10.906
Come here.

26:14.160 --> 26:16.139
If things are as bad as Demelza says...

26:17.480 --> 26:19.345
...we must make a plan.

26:19.520 --> 26:23.866
But will 'ee 'ave time for such a thing,
now 'ee 'ave London matters to attend to?

26:24.040 --> 26:26.702
Ross, will you tell Demelza of Caroline?

26:30.160 --> 26:31.787
We have a daughter.

26:31.960 --> 26:34.178
Why, that is joyful news!

26:34.360 --> 26:35.827
- Thank you.
- And Mrs Enys be well?

26:36.000 --> 26:37.217
Most well, I thank you.

26:40.800 --> 26:42.347
Why, that is so pretty.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.499
Mr Cardy has a new enterprise.

26:48.840 --> 26:50.501
You must rest, my friend.

26:50.680 --> 26:53.387
I will leave you to the able offices
of Reverend Whitworth.

27:02.560 --> 27:06.189
"Repent ye,
for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."

27:07.000 --> 27:09.377
Hear now the comfortable words of St James:

27:10.200 --> 27:12.782
"Blessed is the man
who has resisted temptation..."

27:12.960 --> 27:14.507
Ah...

27:14.680 --> 27:16.659
but that's just it, good sir.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.545
Ihaven1".

27:19.720 --> 27:21.585
Resisted. ..

27:21.760 --> 27:23.148
temptation.

27:23.320 --> 27:26.187
And is it the sins of your youth
which now trouble you?

27:26.360 --> 27:29.306
No, sir...the sins of my age.

27:29.480 --> 27:33.587
Gluttony? Sloth? Cheating at whist?

27:33.760 --> 27:39.983
I have - in recent years -
indulged in a little idle speculation.

27:40.560 --> 27:44.303
Investments in_some of
our burgeoning industries.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.780
Which, regrettably...

27:48.000 --> 27:49.262
...have failed.

27:49.440 --> 27:51.385
So you lost money. What of it?

27:52.600 --> 27:58.823
Only that...the money with which I speculated...
was not my own.

28:05.680 --> 28:08.581
When I left for Westminster,
the mine was in profit.

28:09.440 --> 28:12.227
The lode showed no sign of petering out.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.300
And we even considered taking on more men.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.141
'Twas a reasonable thought.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.982
- In the end, we decided against.
- Which was fortunate.

28:19.160 --> 28:20.582
Since the lode began to fail.

28:20.760 --> 28:23.263
So...we have a choice:

28:24.720 --> 28:27.427
work the lode till it's exhausted...

28:28.080 --> 28:29.468
"OF...

28:30.160 --> 28:33.061
...drive through to
the old Wheal Maiden workings.

28:37.120 --> 28:41.261
Beggin' yer pardon -
but what may seem simple to an outsider...

28:45.840 --> 28:49.219
Meanin' no disrespect-
'tis only we, bein' below all these months...

28:49.400 --> 28:52.824
- Seein' how the land lies...
- As opposed to thee - bein' above grass.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.185
- An' far away in London.
- Not that that be a bad thing.

28:56.360 --> 28:59.500
Nay, 'tis a comfort to know we 'ave
'ee to speak for we in Parliament...

28:59.680 --> 29:02.057
Do you think me out of touch
with my own mine?

29:06.000 --> 29:07.979
Like we said - no disrespect.

29:10.240 --> 29:11.787
No.

29:16.720 --> 29:18.585
Let's think on it...

29:18.760 --> 29:20.625
talk further.

29:29.960 --> 29:31.939
(Lively chatter)

29:37.600 --> 29:38.862
(Door opens)

29:39.040 --> 29:41.349
Ah, the venturer returns.

29:41.960 --> 29:47.944
Last year, because of a stupid and contrived
agreement between two of our so-called nobility,

29:48.120 --> 29:50.623
- I lost my seat to Ross Poldark.
- Mm.

29:50.800 --> 29:54.497
Unless we arrange to shoot him on the highway,
I cannot now unseat him.

29:55.240 --> 29:57.822
But I see no reason
to be excluded from the House.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.707
Nor need you be. Seats are for sale.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.268
So buy one.

30:02.440 --> 30:05.341
But who is willing to sell
so soon after an election?

30:06.160 --> 30:07.582
Life is short.

30:07.760 --> 30:09.341
I don't wish to wait.

30:11.480 --> 30:13.505
I've decided to buy a borough.

30:13.680 --> 30:15.181
You're out of your mind!

30:15.360 --> 30:16.827
With a borough, I have control.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.504
When I own properties, I own voters.
And I can dispense patronage.

30:20.680 --> 30:23.319
A useful appointment here,
a profitable contract there.

30:23.480 --> 30:26.825
I would acquire influence
of a hitherto unprecedented kind.

30:27.000 --> 30:29.787
Assuming you can find someone willing to sell.

30:29.960 --> 30:32.599
Which is where Monk Adderley comes in.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.625
At a price.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.621
Which I'm willing to pay
for my own benefit.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.665
And that of my children.

30:39.840 --> 30:43.059
- Oh. ls Elizabeth...
- No.

30:44.880 --> 30:46.780
But at some point, she will be.

30:50.960 --> 30:52.746
Mining folk are fickle.

30:52.920 --> 30:54.979
I had not thought so till now.

30:55.160 --> 30:58.459
Which makes me all the more appreciative
of my other friends.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.861
One of mine is fading.
Old Nat Pearce?

31:02.040 --> 31:03.746
Poor demented old fool.

31:03.920 --> 31:06.559
Reverend Whitworth is praying for him.

31:11.720 --> 31:15.599
Ah, Cousin George, I trust you had my note?

31:16.320 --> 31:18.902
I have just this instant returned from London.

31:20.520 --> 31:25.298
No matter. I was writing to inform you
that the living of Luxulyan is vacant.

31:28.880 --> 31:32.065
- Had you not heard?
- Is it likely that I would?

31:33.480 --> 31:36.984
Ah, but one must keep
one's ear close to the ground.

31:37.160 --> 31:39.264
One never knows what one might pick up.

31:40.080 --> 31:43.982
Why, only today, I heard the most extraordinary
news from old Nat Pearce,

31:44.160 --> 31:46.503
even now at death's door.

31:47.200 --> 31:49.145
What manner of news?

31:49.320 --> 31:55.225
The old fool has squandered funds, entrusted to
him by his clients, on hopeless speculations.

31:57.400 --> 32:01.621
- Has he?
- And these funds were deposited where?

32:01.800 --> 32:04.507
I believe at Pascoe's Bank.

32:09.480 --> 32:13.428
I will think further about the living of Luxulyan.

32:14.440 --> 32:17.000
- Pray let me have time to consider.
- Of course.

32:17.160 --> 32:19.799
By all means. Mm-hm.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.827
Pascoe's Bank stands guarantor
for all those funds.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.663
And Ross Poldark's entire capital
is also lodged at Pascoe's Bank.

32:34.840 --> 32:41.222
So when Nat Pearce finally expires,
the pressure which might be brought to bear...

32:42.360 --> 32:45.067
...could kill two birds with one stone.

32:57.720 --> 32:59.221
Well, Ross!

33:00.120 --> 33:03.704
Is Cornwall not tedious
after the heady bustle of London?

33:04.560 --> 33:07.586
Personally, I find it very much to my taste.

33:08.880 --> 33:11.519
- You?
- Oh, it has its attractions.

33:12.560 --> 33:13.777
And its uses.

33:20.720 --> 33:22.620
Excuse me, sir, can I look at these?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.662
It was no small feat to secure Adderley.

33:29.400 --> 33:32.107
But he is expert in these matters
and I shall be guided by him.

33:32.280 --> 33:34.100
So what does he suggest?

33:34.280 --> 33:35.827
A gathering...

33:36.000 --> 33:38.264
the like of which this house has never seen.

33:38.440 --> 33:40.305
Who would we invite?

33:40.480 --> 33:43.540
Guests from London -
hand-picked for their usefulness.

33:43.720 --> 33:46.621
And a number of local worthies
who have boroughs...

33:47.520 --> 33:49.897
...and might be persuaded to part with them.

33:56.400 --> 33:59.062
Chibby, chibby, chibby, chibby, chibby, chibby!

33:59.240 --> 34:00.628
(Laughs)

34:00.800 --> 34:02.620
A cherub!

34:02.800 --> 34:04.540
A tiresome one,

34:04.720 --> 34:06.540
which takes up so much of my time,

34:06.720 --> 34:10.019
forcing me to neglect more important matters
such as horses and dogs.

34:10.200 --> 34:12.065
(Chuckling)

34:14.040 --> 34:17.385
Beg pardon, ma'am, I finished the caps
for the children. I must be on my way.

34:17.560 --> 34:19.778
Oh! Well, Drake was just leaving.

34:19.960 --> 34:23.225
- Perhaps you'd walk Rosina as far as Sawle?
- Oh, no, there be no need.

34:23.400 --> 34:26.824
I think 't'would be a kindness,
with night drawin' in.

34:31.800 --> 34:33.301
We'll both go.

34:43.480 --> 34:46.426
A more blatant contrivance I've yet to see!

34:46.600 --> 34:49.467
Yet is it wrong?
The life he wished was not for the takin'.

34:49.640 --> 34:53.383
- So may I not then help him choose another?
- (Laughter)

34:54.920 --> 34:57.229
(Hammer striking metal)

34:58.160 --> 35:04.417
Every day, you rise early,
you eat late, you scarce sleep.

35:04.600 --> 35:08.149
But to what end, brother?
You've been stricken in love.

35:08.320 --> 35:11.027
But now I reckon - an' so do Sister-

35:11.920 --> 35:15.185
there be no better young woman
than Rosina Hoblyn.

35:15.360 --> 35:17.385
Yeah, and Morwenna?

35:17.560 --> 35:20.347
Morwenna is wed to another
and has a child.

35:21.800 --> 35:23.347
What more can 'ee do?

35:23.520 --> 35:25.181
She belong to Whitworth.

35:25.360 --> 35:27.499
What's done cannot be undone.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.588
Maybe not.

35:31.600 --> 35:34.467
But I can't think of another
while Mon/venna lives.

35:36.200 --> 35:40.387
An' I'd not disrespect Rosina, to ask for
her heart when I've none to give in return.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.584
Well... Oh, well, I promised her I'd try.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.267
Come here.

36:22.520 --> 36:24.897
R055: 50, my reasoning is this:

36:25.080 --> 36:28.106
Wheal Maiden was never
fully worked out.

36:29.280 --> 36:32.977
The old miners still talk of lodes
left untouched since my father's day.

36:33.160 --> 36:34.866
It's true enough.

36:35.720 --> 36:38.780
These past six months,
you've been on timbering and cross-cutting?

36:38.960 --> 36:40.029
'Tis so.

36:40.200 --> 36:44.102
So, I propose to put a team to shaft-sinking

36:44.280 --> 36:49.217
and another to driving through,
to link up to the old Wheal Maiden workings.

36:50.920 --> 36:53.263
An' who will lead the excavations?

36:53.960 --> 36:55.063
I will.

36:56.720 --> 36:58.301
But what about London?

36:59.280 --> 37:01.862
Well, summer recess is about to begin.

37:02.040 --> 37:05.146
I could give the mine at least three months
before I return.

37:05.320 --> 37:08.778
By that time we'll know
whether it's a good plan or a fool's errand.

37:11.720 --> 37:13.221
Are we agreed?

37:21.880 --> 37:23.620
We start today.

37:24.080 --> 37:26.184
(Rock shattering)

37:56.880 --> 37:57.983
Well, Mama?

37:58.160 --> 38:00.503
(Laughs) My darling!

38:04.400 --> 38:05.981
How tiny it seems now.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.866
London is so much grander.

38:08.040 --> 38:09.428
You're not disappointed?

38:10.840 --> 38:12.819
Not in the least.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.661
- It's good to be home.
- (Chuckles)

38:23.800 --> 38:25.779
Good day, Uncle George.

38:30.000 --> 38:33.060
Good day, little brother!
Shall we go for a canter?

38:38.840 --> 38:40.307
(Barks)

38:41.520 --> 38:43.943
Yes, Horace, you must stay
and guard Miss Sarah

38:44.120 --> 38:46.429
and see she does not waken
until we return.

38:57.240 --> 38:59.140
I do believe Horace is feeling neglected.

38:59.320 --> 39:02.460
Nonsense!
He knows I adore him above all things.

39:02.640 --> 39:06.462
_ Whilst Sarah and I_
are qUIte aware of our own unimportance.

39:11.720 --> 39:13.699
(Sarah gurgles)

39:27.920 --> 39:30.480
You seem very attached to that child,
Dr Enys.

39:30.640 --> 39:33.017
I hope she won't grow up to be a spoilt brat.

39:35.520 --> 39:36.987
No.

39:38.760 --> 39:40.546
A good days work, Coon.

39:40.720 --> 39:43.780
And an early night...
for an early start tomorrow.

39:47.640 --> 39:50.825
- How many are we tonight?
- Oh, we three, Drake, Tholly...

39:51.000 --> 39:54.060
- An' the Widow Crocker?
- (Laughs) If Tholly's sober.

39:54.240 --> 39:56.617
Sober enough to hang on
to the end of a fishin' line!

39:56.800 --> 39:59.860
Tholly and Crocker,
'Luggan and Sawle's great beauties.

40:00.040 --> 40:01.621
(Chuckling)

40:02.440 --> 40:03.987
(Door closes)

40:16.480 --> 40:18.619
(Drips echoing)

40:25.080 --> 40:28.106
Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

40:48.160 --> 40:50.663
Mr Whitworth bid me take 'im, ma'am.

40:52.880 --> 40:54.825
Thank Mr Whitworth for his kindness

40:55.000 --> 40:57.560
and tell him
John Conan will remain here with me.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.981
(Chamber music being played)

41:20.160 --> 41:22.742
(Chatter)

41:25.040 --> 41:26.223
Yes.

41:31.920 --> 41:33.581
Excuse me, gentlemen.

41:39.400 --> 41:41.709
- My dear.
- Excuse me, General.

41:42.400 --> 41:46.143
May I introduce Captain Monk Adderley?

41:47.840 --> 41:51.025
I'm honoured to make your acquaintance,
ma'am.

41:51.920 --> 41:53.660
Your beauty is legendary.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.220
As is your reputation, sir.

42:01.440 --> 42:03.419
(Music and lively chatter)

42:11.440 --> 42:15.422
So, Hant0n...has large investments
in the East India Company,

42:15.600 --> 42:18.467
comes of common stock
but has thrown off his humble beginnings

42:18.640 --> 42:20.858
and is everywhere accepted.

42:21.040 --> 42:23.019
Robinson is a close friend of Pitt.

42:23.760 --> 42:26.706
- And that gentleman...
- Is Sir Christopher Hawkins -

42:26.880 --> 42:30.464
lawyer, MP, baronet, High Sheriff of Cornwall.

42:31.320 --> 42:33.504
I must make a point of dancing with him.

42:34.840 --> 42:36.819
This is what you were born for, my dear.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.979
Adderley spotted it at once.

42:39.720 --> 42:42.826
And when our elevation c_omes -
as he assures me it Will -

42:43.640 --> 42:47.098
it is our children who will beneﬁt.

42:50.880 --> 42:52.541
(Clucking)

42:52.720 --> 42:56.497
It seems we're the only folk in Cornwall
without a party to go to!

42:57.520 --> 43:00.080
Dwight and Caroline are at Trenwith?

43:00.240 --> 43:02.424
And Sam and Drake are at the beach.

43:04.720 --> 43:06.665
'Tis only line fishin', Ross.

43:06.840 --> 43:10.025
Everyone goes. No-one waits to be invited.
You never did.

43:17.200 --> 43:19.464
It's your beach, Ross.

43:20.280 --> 43:22.305
You could just go.

43:24.920 --> 43:26.660
(Goat bleats)

43:26.840 --> 43:28.467
You be good.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.309
(Music and chatter)

43:37.680 --> 43:42.800
- Oh, my sweet boy!
- Please do not tell me how much I've grown!

43:43.960 --> 43:45.985
As if I would! (Chuckles)

43:56.920 --> 43:58.501
What can you be thinking, Dr Enys?

43:58.680 --> 44:01.387
How to make your escape
and return to our odious offspring?

44:03.200 --> 44:04.667
Something along those lines.

44:04.840 --> 44:07.661
Well, not before you've danced
the Allemande with me.

44:08.640 --> 44:11.825
Oh, my school is a hell-hole
but I'm used to it now.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.777
In first year, my tutor was a noted flogbottomist,
so I was in agonies!

44:15.960 --> 44:18.622
But this year, I'm rid of him
and shall have my own fag.

44:21.840 --> 44:24.661
- And have acquired a taste for liquor, I see.
- (Both laugh)

44:25.720 --> 44:28.700
Of which, I note,
your stepfather disapproves.

44:29.640 --> 44:34.100
My dear sir,
may I introduce Sir Christopher Hawkins?

44:42.760 --> 44:44.739
(Waves crashing)

44:46.920 --> 44:48.899
(Raised voices nearby)

44:52.720 --> 44:54.699
(Grunting and yelling)

44:56.360 --> 44:57.941
Urgh!

45:02.240 --> 45:03.628
DRAKE: Cap'n Ross!

45:03.800 --> 45:07.497
The Crockers from 'Luggan - them beatin' the
life out 0' Tholly on account 0' Widder Crocker.

45:07.680 --> 45:08.942
- Who?
- 'OO Tholly did bed!

45:09.120 --> 45:12.624
Turns out she ain't no widde_r. Mr Crocker's
none too pleased, nor his brothers!

45:12.800 --> 45:14.859
- So I'm going to Sawle for help.
-Noﬁmd

45:17.120 --> 45:18.860
(Grunting and groaning)

45:22.360 --> 45:23.543
(Groaning)

45:30.560 --> 45:31.777
(Chamber music)

45:31.960 --> 45:34.303
At a dinner last week,
your name was mentioned.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.388
In er...what context?

45:36.560 --> 45:41.304
That your grandfather worked a forge in Hayle
and had not a penny to his name.

45:41.480 --> 45:44.426
But that his grandson,
by industry and good luck,

45:44.600 --> 45:47.262
had amassed a fortune of 200,000.

45:47.440 --> 45:49.943
In one particular that is incorrect.

45:50.120 --> 45:52.304
My grandfather's forge was in St Day.

45:54.480 --> 45:57.699
As I understand it,
you wish to acquire a borough.

45:59.000 --> 46:01.184
Do you...know of any?

46:02.080 --> 46:03.980
I, myself, have three.

46:05.480 --> 46:08.040
And one of them -
the borough of St Michael -

46:08.200 --> 46:12.261
boasts not one MP...but two.

46:16.680 --> 46:19.057
(Groaning and shouting)

46:44.680 --> 46:47.581
Tholly! Tholly!

46:48.880 --> 46:51.440
Cap'n Ross! Is he breathin'?

46:51.600 --> 46:53.181
Is he? I can't tell!

47:11.480 --> 47:12.583
(Gasps)

47:18.160 --> 47:22.301
Is it thee, Cap'n,
come t' fight 'Luggan's finest?

47:22.480 --> 47:24.505
- Who else would be stupid enough?
- (Laughs)

47:24.680 --> 47:27.240
Though I believe we've bin 'ere before, Ross?

47:28.160 --> 47:30.139
I believe we have!

47:30.320 --> 47:32.299
It looks like they 'Luggan folk never learn!

47:32.480 --> 47:35.665
He's an idiot an' a fornic_ator
an' 'ave brought this on himself.

47:35.840 --> 47:37.705
R055: He
/5
an idiot.

47:37.880 --> 47:39.461
But he's still my friend.

47:39.640 --> 47:41.426
(Laughs wearily)

47:41.600 --> 47:44.307
So all of us, Ross. So all.

47:53.240 --> 47:56.380
(Hearty singing)
Thinks I to myself, what a jolly herring

47:56.560 --> 47:59.302
Thinks I to myself, it's a jolly herring

48:00.640 --> 48:03.097
- (Tholly roars)
- Get up, get up, get up.

48:03.280 --> 48:09.662
'Tis time for I to seek oblivion
in the arms of some fresher wench!

48:11.320 --> 48:16.019
There's nothin' like a dice with death
to sharpen a man's appetite fer the WW!

48:22.600 --> 48:24.818
(Sniggering and laughter)

48:26.040 --> 48:28.019
Ye'll be glad 0' thy bed tonight!

48:28.920 --> 48:31.741
Strangely, I feel wide awake.

48:32.440 --> 48:35.500
Mebbe 'ee should call
at the Great House for a nightcap.

48:35.680 --> 48:37.341
(Laughter)

48:42.600 --> 48:44.579
(Chamber music)

48:51.360 --> 48:52.907
Uh.

49:06.200 --> 49:07.542
(Sniffs)

49:07.720 --> 49:09.699
(Gravel crunches underfoot)

49:11.720 --> 49:13.665
Good evening, Elizabeth.

49:13.840 --> 49:15.228
Ross?

49:16.280 --> 49:18.862
- You're trespassing.
- Not entirely.

49:19.920 --> 49:22.184
This is, after all, a Poldark house.

49:23.000 --> 49:26.219
And, as the senior Poldark left alive...

49:26.400 --> 49:28.903
I have a fancy to see
what sort of party you're giving.

49:29.080 --> 49:30.581
But if George should see you...

49:30.760 --> 49:34.184
Oh, he wouldn't risk a scandal
in front of all his fine guests.

49:35.120 --> 49:38.180
Not that I seek confrontation...ever.

49:38.360 --> 49:39.679
Hm.

49:42.280 --> 49:43.907
I came out for a breath of air.

49:44.080 --> 49:48.301
- Is Geoffrey Charles here?
- Yes, but do not speak to him tonight.

49:49.240 --> 49:52.220
- I see enough of him in London.
- I know.

49:52.960 --> 49:54.939
It pleases him greatly.

49:55.120 --> 49:57.384
But he's so worldly-wise, Ross.

49:57.560 --> 50:00.063
So bias for one so young.

50:00.240 --> 50:01.787
He'll grow out of it.

50:02.560 --> 50:04.778
Francis was no different at that age.

50:05.680 --> 50:07.181
You think him like Francis?

50:09.280 --> 50:11.259
In the better ways, yes.

50:15.320 --> 50:16.821
And Valentine?

50:18.400 --> 50:20.220
He's well.

50:21.680 --> 50:24.342
And George...his suspicions?

50:25.680 --> 50:26.999
Gone.

50:27.160 --> 50:31.142
And will only return if he has cause...
such as your coming here tonight.

50:31.320 --> 50:33.345
Madam, is this gentleman annoying you?

50:33.520 --> 50:35.829
Er...n0. Not at all.

50:36.000 --> 50:38.059
Why would you suppose it likely?

50:38.960 --> 50:41.906
I have not the honour of your acquaintance, sir.

50:42.080 --> 50:46.267
My cousin, Captain Ross Poldark -
Captain Monk Adderley.

50:46.440 --> 50:48.340
Your servant, sir.

50:49.000 --> 50:51.503
I confess, when I saw you
talking to Mrs Warleggan,

50:51.680 --> 50:55.502
I took you for a threadbare troubadour
who'd been dismissed without a tip!

50:55.680 --> 50:57.227
I sing ill.

50:57.400 --> 50:59.982
And accept tips with even less grace.

51:00.160 --> 51:04.620
Oh, whereas I, on principle,
always accept what ladies have to offer.

51:12.200 --> 51:15.579
- Shall we return to the party?
- One moment.

51:16.520 --> 51:18.784
The name Poldark rings a bell.

51:19.480 --> 51:22.119
- Are you not in the House?
- A new member.

51:22.280 --> 51:25.022
- Mm. _
- I don't recollect seeing you there.

51:25.200 --> 51:27.179
(Scoffs) Nor is it likely.

51:28.280 --> 51:30.419
I seldom attend.

51:37.240 --> 51:38.707
Good night, Elizabeth.

51:39.720 --> 51:41.506
Good night, Ross.

51:45.400 --> 51:47.379
(Footsteps receding)

51:52.880 --> 51:54.859
GEORGE: Excuse me.

51:56.720 --> 52:02.067
My clear, the borough of St Michael
is mine for the asking.

52:03.600 --> 52:05.500
Or, should I say, the purchasing.

52:05.680 --> 52:07.022
That's pleasing news.

52:07.200 --> 52:10.784
And more pleasing still
is that it has two sitting members.

52:10.960 --> 52:13.463
Of course, I'll need to induce
one of them to stand down.

52:13.640 --> 52:15.665
But my ultimate aim is to control both seats.

52:15.840 --> 52:18.183
With two seats to put
at the government's disposal...

52:18.360 --> 52:21.420
You would be in a position
to ask for favours in return.

52:22.120 --> 52:27.023
- And that would make you...
- Very...powerful...indeed.

52:38.040 --> 52:40.224
(Sarah grizzles)

52:55.680 --> 52:56.817
(Door opens)

53:02.200 --> 53:04.145
Did you catch anything?

53:04.320 --> 53:06.299
A death of cold.

53:06.960 --> 53:09.781
And more rough and tumble
than I bargained for.

53:10.680 --> 53:13.740
But, yes - it was as I hoped.

53:16.280 --> 53:18.919
Then we went to the kiddly and we drank.

53:20.240 --> 53:23.061
- And then you came home.
- And then I came home...

53:25.000 --> 53:26.661
...by way of Trenwith.

53:26.840 --> 53:28.979
- You didn't?
- Naturally, I didn't go in.

53:29.160 --> 53:30.787
But to even go near!

53:30.960 --> 53:33.667
- An' to what end, to provoke George?
- No!

53:33.840 --> 53:37.344
It was an impulse - to see the place again.

53:38.560 --> 53:41.859
- And Elizabeth?
- I found her walking in the garden.

53:42.880 --> 53:44.905
And we spoke a little.

53:45.080 --> 53:48.777
She was not...unwelcoming.

53:54.480 --> 53:56.983
You don't suspect an attachment there still?

53:58.800 --> 54:01.542
No more than you suspect
my attachment to Hugh.

54:03.960 --> 54:07.862
- Except you do still suspect.
- I cannot compete with a ghost.

54:08.040 --> 54:10.065
No more could I compete with an ideal.

54:13.480 --> 54:15.459
Is that why it happened with Hugh?

54:16.640 --> 54:18.107
To teach me a lesson?

54:20.360 --> 54:21.941
You know it was not.

54:25.600 --> 54:29.297
These shadows, Hugh and Elizabeth...

54:33.040 --> 54:36.100
Do we not have enough to grapple with,
without they come between us?

54:38.800 --> 54:40.665
Yes.

54:40.840 --> 54:42.307
We have enough.

54:44.720 --> 54:46.699
I have something for you.

55:01.400 --> 55:02.583
Ross.

55:04.440 --> 55:09.457
All these months you've had nothing from me
except doubts and mistrust.

55:10.840 --> 55:12.421
I thought you deserved better.

55:13.680 --> 55:15.227
(She exhales)

55:32.960 --> 55:34.427
Here, let me.

55:49.880 --> 55:52.337
Are we strangers still?

55:52.920 --> 55:54.467
Yes.

55:55.800 --> 55:59.145
But strangers who know
every inch of each other's skin.

56:02.920 --> 56:05.377
So perhaps we should begin again from there.
