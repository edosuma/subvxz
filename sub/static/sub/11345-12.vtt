IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:08.609 --> 00:12.413
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:12.446 --> 00:14.748
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:14.782 --> 00:16.450
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:16.484 --> 00:17.718
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.751 --> 00:20.054
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:20.088 --> 00:22.223
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.162
[pounding on door]
- LARISSA.

00:28.196 --> 00:31.199
[pounding]
LARISSA!

00:31.232 --> 00:33.801
- WHO ARE YOU?
- I'M, UH, PATRICK,

00:33.834 --> 00:35.769
LARISSA'S BOYFRIEND.
- PROVE IT.

00:35.803 --> 00:38.206
- I WALK HER HOME EVERY NIGHT.
SHE...

00:38.239 --> 00:39.673
SHE DIDN'T SHOW UP AT WORK,

00:39.707 --> 00:41.309
AND SHE'S NOT ANSWERING
HER PHONE.

00:41.342 --> 00:45.213
- WELL, SHE GAVE ME A SPARE
KEY IN CASE OF EMERGENCIES.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.615
- THANK YOU.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.389
LARISSA!

00:57.525 --> 01:00.761
OH, GOD.

01:00.794 --> 01:02.796
LARISSA, WAKE UP.

01:02.830 --> 01:06.100
LARISSA, WAKE UP!

01:06.134 --> 01:07.868
- ARRGH!

01:07.901 --> 01:09.703
GET AWAY FROM BRANDY!

01:09.737 --> 01:11.672
- AAH!

01:11.705 --> 01:13.674
[men grunting]

01:13.707 --> 01:16.410
[punches thudding,
grunting]

01:18.179 --> 01:20.248
- AAH!

01:22.783 --> 01:24.618
- ATTACKED BY A NAKED MAN
IN A MASK.

01:24.652 --> 01:27.455
- THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.
NAME'S PATRICK BINDER.

01:27.488 --> 01:29.690
SCALP LACERATION, BUT HE'S
COHERENT ENOUGH TO TALK.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.259
- OKAY, AND WHAT ABOUT
THE GIRL?

01:31.292 --> 01:33.494
- LARISSA WELSH.
STILL UNCONSCIOUS.

01:33.527 --> 01:34.795
- SHE BEATEN TOO?
- NO.

01:34.828 --> 01:37.598
AN OVERDOSE OF THE SEDATIVE
ROHYPNOL.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.833
I'M TREATING HER
WITH AN ANTIDOTE,

01:39.867 --> 01:42.470
BUT IT MAY BE A WHILE
BEFORE SHE COMES TO.

01:42.503 --> 01:45.173
I FOUND VAGINAL SCARRING,

01:45.206 --> 01:47.675
BUT NO SIGN OF SEXUAL ASSAULT
OR SEMEN.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.543
- RAPIST
DIDN'T FINISH THE JOB.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.612
- HER LUCKY DAY.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.214
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE BAND-AIDS?
- SHE PRESENTED

01:53.247 --> 01:55.716
WITH MORE THAN A DOZEN
FRESH RAZOR CUTS.

01:55.749 --> 01:57.718
- SEXUAL TORTURE?

01:57.751 --> 02:01.589
- MORE LIKE BUMBLING
WITH A GILLETTE.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.825
HER ATTACKER SHAVED HER
FROM THE NECK ON DOWN.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.286
- I SHOULD HAVE SEEN
HIS FAT ASS COMING.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.554
I COULD HAVE
TAKEN HIM EASY.

03:06.587 --> 03:08.456
- GUY IN HIS UNDERWEAR
SWINGING A TRIPOD?

03:08.489 --> 03:09.757
YOU'RE LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.625
- I GREW UP
WITH THREE OLDER BROTHERS.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.494
I CAN TAKE A BEATING
TO THE HEAD.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.763
- SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU
AND LARISSA BEEN DATING?

03:15.796 --> 03:17.598
- ABOUT SIX MONTHS.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.467
BUT WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
FOR TWO YEARS.

03:19.500 --> 03:20.834
TOOK HER THAT LONG

03:20.868 --> 03:22.770
TO OPEN HERSELF UP
TO A RELATIONSHIP.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.772
- ANY IDEA WHY?

03:24.805 --> 03:27.241
- SHE WAS A FOSTER KID.

03:27.275 --> 03:30.911
BUT SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN
TIGHT-LIPPED ABOUT IT.

03:30.944 --> 03:34.248
WHENEVER I TRIED TO GET CLOSE,
SHE PUSHED ME AWAY.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.383
- AND HER ATTACKER.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.518
YOU EVER SEEN HIM AROUND?
- NEVER.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.387
I WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED.
FAT, SWEATY CREEP.

03:39.420 --> 03:41.689
- AND YOU DIDN'T SEE HIS FACE
'CAUSE OF THE MASK.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.424
- IF I DID,
I WOULD'VE PUNCHED IT IN.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.826
- WE'RE GONNA WANT A NURSE
TO SCRAPE YOUR NAILS,

03:45.859 --> 03:47.928
CHECK FOR HAIRS THAT THE PERP
MIGHT HAVE LEFT ON YOU

03:47.961 --> 03:49.463
DURING THE STRUGGLE.

03:49.497 --> 03:51.299
- WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO CATCH THE BASTARD.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.500
- ONE MORE THING.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.934
THE UNDERWEAR
THAT DRESSED LARISSA IN

03:53.967 --> 03:55.769
HAD THE NAME BRANDY ON IT.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.872
ANY IDEA WHO THAT IS?
- NO.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.308
EXCEPT...

04:00.341 --> 04:02.976
LARISSA TOLD ME
SHE HATES THAT NAME.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.479
- ONLY IN NEW YORK
COULD YOU HAVE NO WITNESSES

04:05.513 --> 04:06.880
TO A MASKED MAN
RUNNING DOWN THE STREET

04:06.914 --> 04:08.382
IN HIS TIGHTY-WHITIES.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.684
- NO DNA FROM PATRICK
OR LARISSA'S RAPE KITS.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.486
THE HAIR AND BLOOD
FROM THE RAZORS

04:12.520 --> 04:13.921
ONLY MATCHES LARISSA.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.823
- THEY FOUND PILLS
ALL OVER THE PLACE, DIDN'T THEY?

04:15.856 --> 04:17.391
- YEAH, THE ROOFIES
USED ON LARISSA,

04:17.425 --> 04:19.393
AND VIAGRA YOU FIGURE THE PERP
WAS USING ON HIMSELF.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.861
- IT'S A GOOD THING
PATRICK SHOWED UP.

04:20.894 --> 04:23.431
A PERP ON VIAGRA?
COULD HAVE RAPED HER FOR HOURS.

04:23.464 --> 04:24.932
- THIS WASN'T THE HUMP'S
FIRST BRANDY.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.133
- WHAT DO YOU GOT?

04:26.166 --> 04:29.370
- PERP'S M.O. MATCHES THE RAPES
OF TWO TEN-YEAR-OLD GIRLS

04:29.403 --> 04:31.572
FROM JERSEY AND CONNECTICUT
IN THE LAST YEAR.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.374
- I'VE NEVER SEEN A CASE
WHERE A RAPIST TARGETS

04:33.407 --> 04:35.676
ADULT WOMEN AND LITTLE GIRLS.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.811
- MAYBE WHY HE SHAVED LARISSA,
MAKE HER LOOK LIKE A KID.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.580
- THIS HAS TO BE OUR GUY.
BOTH GIRLS HAVE

04:39.613 --> 04:42.483
LONG, BLONDE HAIR WHICH
THE RAPIST PUT IN PIGTAILS,

04:42.516 --> 04:44.452
AND HE CALLED 'EM BOTH
BRANDY.

04:46.887 --> 04:49.423
- I DON'T KNOW WHY
HE CALLED ME THAT.

04:49.457 --> 04:51.492
MY NAME'S KELLY.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.394
- CAN YOU DESCRIBE HIM?

04:53.427 --> 04:56.464
- HE WAS GROSS.
AND FAT.

04:56.497 --> 04:59.967
AND HE MADE ME DO MY HAIR
LIKE THE GIRL IN THE PICTURE.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.002
- HE SHOWED YOU PICTURES?

05:02.035 --> 05:04.104
- OF A GIRL NAMED BRANDY.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.408
- HE WANTED YOU
TO LOOK LIKE HER?

05:07.441 --> 05:09.943
- YES. EVEN HERE.

05:09.977 --> 05:13.381
HE SAID BRANDY
HAD A BIRTHMARK.

05:13.414 --> 05:16.350
SO HE DREW ONE ON ME TOO.

05:16.384 --> 05:19.119
AND THEN HE HURT ME.

05:19.152 --> 05:22.523
- HE HURT ME REAL BAD,
BUT...

05:22.556 --> 05:24.892
I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING ELSE.

05:26.159 --> 05:29.797
- YOU KNOW, PAULA,
ANYTHING YOU CAN TELL ME...

05:29.830 --> 05:33.467
COULD STOP THIS MAN FROM HURTING
ANOTHER LITTLE GIRL.

05:33.501 --> 05:37.004
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
YOU CAN TALK TO ME.

05:39.973 --> 05:42.843
- A-ARE YOU TESTING ME?

05:45.145 --> 05:47.548
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY THAT?

05:47.581 --> 05:49.583
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
TEST YOU?

05:49.617 --> 05:51.485
- HE SAID PEOPLE WOULD TEST ME

05:51.519 --> 05:53.621
TO TRY TO TRICK ME
INTO TELLING.

05:53.654 --> 05:56.156
- MM-HMM. AND IF YOU TOLD
ANYONE, HE WOULD HURT YOU.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.526
- ME AND DADDY.

05:58.559 --> 06:01.429
- HE ONLY SAID THAT
TO SCARE YOU.

06:01.462 --> 06:04.031
NOW, I CAN PROTECT YOU,
AND I WILL PROTECT YOU.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.434
BUT YOU HAVE TO...

06:06.467 --> 06:07.701
[sighs]

06:07.735 --> 06:10.438
TELL ME, YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING ABOUT HIM.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.443
- BUT...
WHAT ABOUT THE LETTER?

06:15.476 --> 06:17.144
- WHAT LETTER?

06:32.526 --> 06:34.161
WHO GAVE THAT TO YOU?

06:34.194 --> 06:36.897
- I FOUND IT UNDER MY PILLOW.

06:38.499 --> 06:41.101
THEY...PUT IT THERE.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.906
THEY CALL THEMSELVES...

06:45.939 --> 06:49.443
COVENTRY.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.516
- THE FBI HAS IDENTIFIED
THESE MARKS

06:55.549 --> 06:57.851
AS UNDERGROUND PEDOPHILE
TRADING SYMBOLS.

06:57.885 --> 07:00.521
I'VE SEEN THEM ON COINS
AND RINGS AND NECKLACES

07:00.554 --> 07:02.222
BUT NEVER USED
FOR INTIMIDATION PURPOSES.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.458
- PEDOPHILES USE THEM
TO IDENTIFY EACH OTHER.

07:04.492 --> 07:07.461
- LARGE TRIANGLE
SURROUNDING SMALLER TRIANGLES

07:07.495 --> 07:08.862
INDICATE BOY LOVERS.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.564
HEARTS WITHIN HEARTS,
GIRL LOVERS.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.700
BUTTERFLIES INDICATE
CHILD LOVERS

07:12.733 --> 07:14.502
THAT DON'T HAVE
A GENDER PREFERENCE.

07:14.535 --> 07:16.804
- SO YOU'RE SAYING OUR RAPIST
IS PART OF A RING.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.740
- WHETHER HE'S IN A RING OR NOT,
HE'S FIXATED ON LARISSA.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.743
HE MADE HER DRESS
AS A LITTLE GIRL, SHAVED HER.

07:22.776 --> 07:23.977
- HE STILL NEEDED VIAGRA
TO GET IT UP.

07:24.011 --> 07:24.912
- BECAUSE AS AN ADULT,

07:24.945 --> 07:27.180
SHE ONLY PARTIALLY
FULFILLED HIS DESIRES.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.082
- OKAY, HOW 'BOUT THE NAME
COVENTRY?

07:29.116 --> 07:31.018
I MEAN, WHO ARE THEY?
- THEY'RE THE BOGEYMAN.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.153
PEDOPHILES ONLY USE
THE NAME COVENTRY

07:33.186 --> 07:35.523
WHEN THEY WANNA SCARE
THEIR VICTIMS.

07:35.556 --> 07:39.059
THE FBI SAID THIS IS THE FIRST
FILM WHERE THE NAME WAS USED.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.595
- [distorted voice]
TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES, BRANDY.

07:41.629 --> 07:43.531
- MY NAME'S NOT BRANDY.
- SON OF A BITCH

07:43.564 --> 07:45.198
ALTERED HIS VOICE...
- DO IT!

07:45.232 --> 07:46.867
- SO WE COULDN'T I.D. HIM.
- OR COVENTRY WILL KILL

07:46.900 --> 07:51.505
YOUR MOMMY AND DADDY AND ALL
YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

07:51.539 --> 07:54.542
- OKAY. ALL RIGHT, MUNCH,
ENOUGH.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.810
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT.
HOLD THAT. FREEZE THAT.

07:59.713 --> 08:03.917
LARISSA HAS THE SAME BIRTHMARK
AS THE KID IN THE FILM.

08:03.951 --> 08:06.554
SHE'S BRANDY.
- A LOT OF UNIDENTIFIED KIDS

08:06.587 --> 08:08.055
ARE PART OF
THIS COVENTRY SERIES.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.023
BUT BRANDY
WAS THE MOST POPULAR,

08:10.057 --> 08:12.526
DUE SPECIFICALLY
TO A STAR-SHAPED BIRTHMARK.

08:12.560 --> 08:14.161
- GOT SOMETHING
THAT'LL INTEREST YOU.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.263
COULDN'T PULL ANYTHING
OFF THE ACTUAL LETTER,

08:16.296 --> 08:17.130
BUT NEW IMAGING TECHNOLOGY

08:17.164 --> 08:19.232
LETS ME ZOOM IN
ON THE PERP'S FINGERTIP.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.201
Munch: YOU CAN GET
A PRINT OFF A PHOTO?

08:21.234 --> 08:24.905
- AND RUN IT FOR A MATCH.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.607
- ELDON BALOGH.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.208
HE DID TIME IN 2006

08:28.241 --> 08:30.878
FOR LEWD AND LASCIVIOUS ACTS
WITH A CHILD.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.080
- AND LIVES IN PARK SLOPE.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.081
- POLICE! SEARCH WARRANT!

08:34.114 --> 08:35.215
- NYPD!

08:35.248 --> 08:36.984
ELDON BALOGH,
SHOW YOURSELF!

08:39.587 --> 08:40.788
- CLEAR!

08:40.821 --> 08:41.955
- CLEAR!

08:41.989 --> 08:44.257
- HEY, YO, EL,
CHECK THIS OUT.

08:46.259 --> 08:49.697
IT'S VIDEO OF LARISSA
BEFORE THE BOYFRIEND ARRIVED.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.034
- LET'S CHECK THE PILLOWCASE.

08:56.303 --> 08:59.106
VIDEOS AND PICTURES.

08:59.139 --> 09:01.208
- IS THAT BRANDY?

09:03.176 --> 09:04.244
[beep]

09:04.277 --> 09:06.814
WHAT'S THAT?
[beep]

09:06.847 --> 09:09.016
[beep]

09:09.049 --> 09:10.851
[beep]

09:12.052 --> 09:15.122
HE LEFT HIS EMAIL ACCOUNT
OPEN.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.324
WHEREVER HE IS,
HE'S SENDING PHOTOS TO HIMSELF.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.927
- BRANDY. PICK 53.
OPEN THAT ONE.

09:19.960 --> 09:21.962
- IT'S LARISSA.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.097
HE'S BEEN STALKING HER
EVER SINCE THE ATTACK!

09:24.131 --> 09:25.999
- SON OF A BITCH
IS AT THE HOSPITAL.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.168
I'M GONNA CALL SECURITY.
- LIV.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.372
- [groans]
AH!

09:32.405 --> 09:34.207
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHERE'S LARISSA WELSH?

09:34.241 --> 09:36.243
- AN ORDERLY TOOK HER FOR
TESTING 20 MINUTES AGO.

09:36.276 --> 09:38.245
- THIS GUY?
- THAT'S HIM.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.180
- AH...

09:40.213 --> 09:42.082
ANY SIGN OF HIM?
- NO, MA'AM.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.383
- LOCK THIS HOSPITAL DOWN NOW!

09:43.416 --> 09:45.653
- SECURITY, CENTRAL.
CLOSE ALL EXITS.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.960
- LIV, I'M ON MY WAY TO YOU.
WHAT'S YOUR 20?

09:52.993 --> 09:54.194
- WE'VE CLEARED
ONE THROUGH FOUR.

09:54.227 --> 09:55.929
SECURITY'S WORKING
FROM THE TOP DOWN.

09:55.963 --> 09:57.731
HEAD TO SIX AND WORK UP.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.411
[pounds twice]
- POLICE. OPEN UP.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.648
WE HAVE SOMETHING
IN ROOM 820.

10:17.317 --> 10:19.286
[zipping sound]
ZZZT.

10:19.319 --> 10:20.353
- IT'S OKAY.

10:20.387 --> 10:23.256
I WAS JUST TAKING
HER TEMPERATURE.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.265
- LET GO, EL!
EL, EL!

10:32.299 --> 10:34.935
EASY, EASY, MAN!
COME ON.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.303
MAN, COME ON, COME ON.

10:36.336 --> 10:39.139
- SON OF A BITCH
ATTACKED HER AGAIN.

10:41.008 --> 10:43.677
- [laughing]

10:50.317 --> 10:51.885
- HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN...

10:51.919 --> 10:53.353
AFTER EVERYTHING
THAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH?

10:53.386 --> 10:55.055
- LARISSA, I'M SO SORRY.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.290
- THIS HOSPITAL
LET ME GET RAPED?

10:57.324 --> 10:59.026
- PLEASE DON'T LEAVE.
LARISSA, PLEASE DON'T LEAVE.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.695
LET THE DOCTORS
KEEP AN EYE ON YOU.

11:01.729 --> 11:03.096
- WHY?

11:03.130 --> 11:05.398
'CAUSE THEY'RE DOING
SUCH A GREAT JOB?

11:05.432 --> 11:08.335
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

11:08.368 --> 11:10.137
- TO TELL YOU
THAT WE CAUGHT HIM.

11:10.170 --> 11:13.941
AND THAT HE WILL
NEVER HURT YOU AGAIN.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.815
- BEFORE HE KNOCKED ME OUT,

11:21.849 --> 11:24.451
HE SAID HE WAS GONNA
TAKE PICTURES.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.388
DID HE?

11:28.421 --> 11:30.891
- HE TOOK VIDEO.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.860
- NOT AGAIN!

11:38.198 --> 11:41.434
- THIS HAPPENED
WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD.

11:41.468 --> 11:43.871
YOU WERE BRANDY.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.774
- I ALWAYS WILL BE.

11:46.807 --> 11:48.942
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:48.976 --> 11:51.879
- SOMETIMES WHEN I'M WALKING
DOWN THE STREET

11:51.912 --> 11:54.381
OR IN THE SUBWAY,
MEN STARE AT ME.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.784
- 'CAUSE THEY RECOGNIZE YOU
FROM THE MOVIES.

11:56.817 --> 11:57.617
- YES.

11:57.650 --> 12:00.187
THEY HAVE THIS LOOK
IN THEIR EYES,

12:00.220 --> 12:02.823
YOU KNOW, PERVERTS?

12:02.856 --> 12:05.759
THEY GET OFF
ON SEEING ME BEING RAPED.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.294
THEY'LL NEVER LEAVE ME ALONE.

12:09.930 --> 12:12.866
I WISH HE WOULD HAVE
JUST KILLED ME.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.073
- LARISSA,

12:20.107 --> 12:22.309
THE MAN
THAT MADE YOU BRANDY...

12:22.342 --> 12:24.177
IS THAT THE SAME MAN
WHO ATTACKED YOU LAST NIGHT?

12:24.211 --> 12:26.847
- NO! IT WAS A FAN.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.883
HE FOLLOWED ME HOME,

12:29.917 --> 12:32.920
AND HE BROKE INTO MY WINDOW.

12:32.953 --> 12:36.256
AND I-I SCREAMED...

12:38.926 --> 12:41.829
BUT HE SHOVED PILLS
DOWN MY THROAT.

12:45.332 --> 12:48.836
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID
TO ME AS I WAS PASSING OUT?

12:53.173 --> 12:54.875
"THIS IS THE HAPPIEST DAY..."

12:54.908 --> 12:56.509
- OF MY LIFE.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.579
I HAVE BEEN LOOKING
FOR BRANDY FOR YEARS.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.581
YOU KNOW, AFTER--
AFTER I SHAVED HER?

13:01.614 --> 13:03.216
- MM-HMM.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.418
- IF I SQUINTED MY EYES
LIKE THIS JUST THE RIGHT WAY...

13:05.452 --> 13:06.386
- MM-HMM.

13:06.419 --> 13:08.188
- AND IT LOOKED LIKE
SHE WAS LITTLE AGAIN.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.489
- MM-HMM, MM-HMM.
- OH!

13:09.522 --> 13:10.690
- AND PAULA AND KELLY,

13:10.723 --> 13:13.894
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO SQUINT
WHEN YOU WERE RAPING THEM, HUH?

13:13.927 --> 13:16.897
- IT WASN'T RAPE.
NO, THEY PLAYED BRANDY FOR ME.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.498
BUT IT WASN'T LIKE
THE REAL THING.

13:18.531 --> 13:21.068
- YOU WORE A MASK,
YOU TERRIFIED THEM,

13:21.101 --> 13:24.872
AND YOU LEFT THEM A LETTER
SAYING COVENTRY WOULD KILL THEM.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.406
- ONLY PAULA.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.441
SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS
GONNA TELL HER DAD.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.277
- WELL, WHAT WERE YOU
EXPECTING?

13:30.310 --> 13:32.279
YOU KIDNAPPED AND RAPED HER.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.982
- I TOLD YOU,
IT WASN'T RAPE.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.550
WHAT I DID WITH THEM WAS--
WAS NATURAL.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.888
THE LOVE THAT I HAVE
FOR BRANDY

13:40.921 --> 13:42.455
IS PURE.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.125
IT'S HONEST.

13:45.158 --> 13:49.196
IT'S AS REAL AS THE LOVE
THAT YOU FEEL FOR YOUR WIFE.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.935
- YOU'RE INSANE.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.103
- NO. NO.

13:56.136 --> 13:57.905
JUST JEALOUS.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.572
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY JEALOUS?

13:59.606 --> 14:01.942
ARE YOU JEALOUS
OF THE GIRLS YOU ATTACKED?

14:01.975 --> 14:04.111
- THE OLD MAN.

14:04.144 --> 14:06.947
AND HOW LUCKY HE WAS.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.182
I NEVER MEANT
TO MURDER HIM.

14:11.251 --> 14:12.585
- YOU MURDERED AN OLD MAN?

14:12.619 --> 14:14.554
- UNDERWOOD.

14:14.587 --> 14:17.657
UM, I MET HIM
ON THE INTERNET.

14:17.690 --> 14:22.029
HE KNEW BRANDY AS A CHILD.

14:22.062 --> 14:25.498
AND I JUST WANTED
TO GET HIM TO TELL ME

14:25.532 --> 14:27.935
HER REAL NAME.

14:30.670 --> 14:32.639
Benson: MR. UNDERWOOD?

14:34.041 --> 14:38.411
MR. UNDERWOOD?
ARE YOU HERE?

14:38.445 --> 14:42.382
- LIV.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.317
HELL OF A LOT OF BLOOD.

14:44.351 --> 14:47.654
- WAIT. YOU HEAR THAT?
- [whimpering]

14:50.023 --> 14:51.658
[grunting]

14:51.691 --> 14:53.093
- SVU PORTABLE TO CENTRAL.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.962
WE NEED A BUS
AT 160 GROVE STREET.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.330
- MR. UNDERWOOD.
MR. UNDERWOOD, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

14:57.364 --> 14:59.166
- WHO ARE YOU?
- I'M DETECTIVE BENSON.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.301
WE'RE GETTING HELP
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

15:01.334 --> 15:03.503
- MY FLOWERS.
ARE THEY ALL DEAD?

15:03.536 --> 15:05.238
- WHY DON'T YOU--
WHY DON'T YOU LAY BACK HERE

15:05.272 --> 15:07.140
UNTIL THE PARAMEDICS COME,
OKAY?

15:07.174 --> 15:09.209
- THE MAN WHO BEAT ME--

15:09.242 --> 15:11.144
- WE ALREADY HAVE HIM
IN CUSTODY.

15:11.178 --> 15:14.181
- [breathing heavily]
IT'S ALWAYS THIS WAY.

15:14.214 --> 15:17.450
EVER SINCE THEY ACCUSED ME
OF RAPING THAT GIRL.

15:17.484 --> 15:20.053
- WHAT DID YOU SAY?

15:20.087 --> 15:22.455
- LIV, THE MISSING PILLOWCASE.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.624
- MATCHES THE ONE
YOU FOUND AT BALOGH'S.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.960
- I ONLY GAVE HIM
LARISSA'S REAL NAME

15:26.994 --> 15:30.330
BECAUSE HE SAID HE'D KILL ME.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.968
- HE TURNED LARISSA
INTO BRANDY.

15:37.670 --> 15:41.208
- ME AND MY FRIENDS
WERE PLAYING HIDE AND GO SEEK,

15:41.241 --> 15:44.277
AND I WAS BEHIND THIS CAR...

15:44.311 --> 15:46.113
DOWN THE BLOCK

15:46.146 --> 15:47.714
WHEN HE OPENED UP
HIS CAR DOOR

15:47.747 --> 15:51.651
AND HE GRABBED ME FROM BEHIND.

15:51.684 --> 15:55.555
HE PUSHED ME FACEDOWN,
AND HE MADE ME TAKE A PILL.

15:55.588 --> 15:59.459
- LIKE LAST NIGHT.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.162
- UNDERWOOD DRUGGED ME
EVERY DAY...

16:02.195 --> 16:04.597
THEN MADE ME
DO THOSE MOVIES.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.600
- WHERE WERE YOUR FOSTER PARENTS
THROUGH ALL THIS?

16:07.634 --> 16:08.568
- EDWARD AND ROBERTA PARKER

16:08.601 --> 16:11.304
HAD SEVEN OTHER FOSTER KIDS
AT THEIR HOME.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.106
THEY NEVER REPORTED
LARISSA MISSING.

16:13.140 --> 16:16.076
- WE HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW SHE FINALLY ESCAPED?

16:16.109 --> 16:17.644
- DANIEL SAVED ME.

16:17.677 --> 16:21.114
- WHO'S DANIEL?
- HE WAS A LITTLE BIT OLDER.

16:21.148 --> 16:26.719
AND UNDERWOOD FORCED HIM
TO MAKE MOVIES WITH ME.

16:26.753 --> 16:29.522
BUT ONE TIME,
DANIEL DISTRACTED HIM

16:29.556 --> 16:32.325
AND I JUMPED OUT THE WINDOW
AND I RAN.

16:34.694 --> 16:37.297
- AND DO YOU KNOW
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO DANIEL?

16:37.330 --> 16:38.531
- NO.

16:38.565 --> 16:41.034
BUT I LIKE TO THINK
THAT HE'S OKAY.

16:41.068 --> 16:43.103
- NO ONE EVER FOUND DANIEL.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.072
LARISSA COULD ONLY
DESCRIBE HIS SMILE.

16:45.105 --> 16:48.141
SIX MONTHS AFTER SHE ESCAPED,
LARISSA SAW A MAN IN THE PARK

16:48.175 --> 16:49.709
WEARING A DISTINCTIVE
CAT BELT BUCKLE.

16:49.742 --> 16:51.611
SHE STARTED TO SCREAM,

16:51.644 --> 16:53.513
AND THE COPS CAME
AND ARRESTED UNDERWOOD.

16:53.546 --> 16:56.749
- HE WAS CHARGED WITH KIDNAPPING
LARISSA AS A CHILD IN '95.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.618
- AND WITH THE RAPE OF A MINOR

16:58.651 --> 17:00.753
AND CREATING AND DISTRIBUTING
CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.622
TEN-YEAR-OLD LARISSA SAYS
HE WAS THE MAN

17:02.655 --> 17:04.424
WHO RAPED HER ON FILM.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.426
- WHY WASN'T HE LOCKED UP?

17:06.459 --> 17:07.627
- LARISSA NEVER SAW HIS FACE.

17:07.660 --> 17:11.298
LACK OF PHYSICAL EVIDENCE
LED THE JURY TO ACQUIT UNDERWOOD

17:11.331 --> 17:13.166
ON ALL CHARGES.
- BECAUSE OF DOUBLE JEOPARDY,

17:13.200 --> 17:16.336
THE OLD SKEEZE CAN'T BE TRIED
AGAIN FOR RAPING LARISSA.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.172
- LARISSA, DID...
ANY OTHER GIRLS MAKE MOVIES?

17:21.241 --> 17:23.643
- DANIEL SAID THAT
THERE WAS...

17:23.676 --> 17:24.511
ONES BEFORE ME,

17:24.544 --> 17:28.315
BUT THEY WERE TARGETED
FOR TERMINATION.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.683
- BY COVENTRY.
- YEAH.

17:30.717 --> 17:34.421
- AFTER THE BRANDY TRIAL,
UNDERWOOD BECAME A LAWYER,

17:34.454 --> 17:37.490
FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHTS
OF THE UNJUSTLY ACCUSED.

17:37.524 --> 17:38.791
- YEAH.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.727
WELL, THAT PILLOWCASE CAME
FROM UNDERWOOD'S HOUSE,

17:40.760 --> 17:44.331
AND THOSE BRANDY PHOTOS
WERE IN THE PILLOWCASE.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.567
THOSE PHOTOS
BELONG TO UNDERWOOD.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.502
- PROVE IT, AND WE'LL NAIL
HIS ASS FOR POSSESSION.

17:49.536 --> 17:50.770
- SHARPEN UP THOSE NAILS.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.672
THE BRANDY PHOTOS
IN THE PILLOWCASE--

17:52.705 --> 17:56.409
THE LAB FOUND ORVILLE
UNDERWOOD'S DNA ALL OVER 'EM.

17:56.443 --> 17:59.246
- MY DNA?
- YOUR DRIED SEMEN.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.614
ON THIS PHOTO THAT WE FOUND
AT ELDON BALOGH'S HOUSE.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.150
- YOU SHOULD REALLY BE
MORE CAREFUL

18:03.183 --> 18:04.384
WHERE YOU PLANT YOUR SEED.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.619
- I'VE NEVER SEEN
THAT PHOTO BEFORE.

18:06.653 --> 18:08.655
- WE KNOW YOU'RE OLD.
NOW YOU'RE BLIND?

18:08.688 --> 18:10.557
- IT DOESN'T BELONG TO ME.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.725
- WELL, THEN HOW DID YOU
DIRTY IT UP--MAGIC?

18:12.759 --> 18:16.563
- I WAS OVER
AT BALOGH'S HOUSE.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.666
WE WERE HAVING A DRINK--
- YOU WERE AT HIS HOUSE?

18:19.699 --> 18:21.734
BECAUSE HE SAID THE FIRST TIME
YOU TWO EVER MET

18:21.768 --> 18:23.770
WAS WHEN HE KICKED IN
YOUR DOOR.

18:23.803 --> 18:26.239
- GENTLEMEN, I DON'T KNOW HOW
MUCH TIME YOU SPENT WITH HIM,

18:26.273 --> 18:28.475
BUT HE'S NOT EXACTLY THE
SHARPEST KNIFE IN THE DRAWER.

18:28.508 --> 18:31.678
STILL, I WAS HAVING A CHAT
AT ELDON BALOGH'S PLACE

18:31.711 --> 18:33.746
WHEN HE LEFT THE ROOM
TO TAKE A PHONE CALL,

18:33.780 --> 18:36.649
AND I SUDDENLY HAD AN URGE.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.418
- AN URGE?

18:38.451 --> 18:40.553
- TO MASTURBATE.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.222
- IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S HOUSE.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.491
- MY LUNGS
MIGHT BE QUITE FRAIL,

18:44.524 --> 18:47.160
BUT I ASSURE YOU,
ALL MY OTHER PARTS WORK.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.661
- RIGHT. GOOD FOR YOU.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.663
SO YOU'RE JUST SITTING
IN ANOTHER GUY'S HOUSE,

18:50.697 --> 18:55.235
AND SUDDENLY YOU DECIDE
IT'S TIME TO PEEL THE BANANA.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.204
- I DID GO INTO THE BATHROOM.

18:57.237 --> 18:59.539
THERE WAS A STACK
OF MAGAZINES BY THE TOILET,

18:59.572 --> 19:01.508
AND MAYBE THAT PHOTO
WAS IN THERE

19:01.541 --> 19:03.743
AND MY DNA LANDED ON IT.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.878
- GOTTA GIVE IT TO THIS GUY.
THAT'S A NEW ONE.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.281
- NEW? YEAH.
BUT NOT GOOD.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.350
- DON'T BELIEVE ME?
PROVE ME WRONG.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.385
BUT THE CLOCK IS TICKING,
DETECTIVES.

19:12.419 --> 19:14.487
YOU HAVE 24 HOURS
FROM THE MOMENT OF MY ARREST

19:14.521 --> 19:15.555
TO ARRAIGN ME.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.957
- YEAH, I FORGOT.
PERVERT HERE IS NOW A LAWYER.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.792
- CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY...

19:19.826 --> 19:22.495
DEFENDING INNOCENT CITIZENS
LIKE MYSELF

19:22.529 --> 19:24.831
AGAINST POLICE ABUSE.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.566
- FROM KIDDIE DIDDLER
TO HUMP HUSTLER--

19:26.599 --> 19:28.668
THAT'S NOT MUCH
OF AN IMPROVEMENT.

19:28.701 --> 19:30.603
- YOU TWO CAN STAY AND CONTINUE
TO BE TITILLATED

19:30.637 --> 19:33.373
BY THE SPECIFICS
OF MY EJACULATION HABITS

19:33.406 --> 19:35.942
OR YOU CAN GO TRY TO FIND
PROBABLE CAUSE TO HOLD ME.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.610
AND I'D SUGGEST THE LATTER,

19:37.644 --> 19:41.214
BECAUSE IN...
22 HOURS AND 38 MINUTES,

19:41.248 --> 19:45.752
I WALK OUT OF POLICE CUSTODY
A FREE AND INNOCENT MAN.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.687
AGAIN.

19:47.720 --> 19:48.955
[knock on door]

19:48.988 --> 19:51.524
- DETECTIVES, A WORD.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.829
- CUT HIM LOOSE?

19:56.863 --> 19:58.598
- WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
TO HOLD HIM.

19:58.631 --> 20:01.434
- DID YOU MISS THE PART WHERE
THERE'S SEMEN ON BRANDY'S PHOTO?

20:01.468 --> 20:02.935
- I ALSO HEARD
HIS EXPLANATION.

20:02.969 --> 20:05.004
- YOU BOUGHT THAT?
- OF COURSE NOT.

20:05.037 --> 20:07.440
BUT THE GUY'S NOT DUMB.
HE WENT TO LAW SCHOOL.

20:07.474 --> 20:09.609
- SINCE WHEN IS THAT
MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE?

20:09.642 --> 20:11.311
- I'M SAYING UNDERWOOD
IS ALREADY SPINNING THIS.

20:11.344 --> 20:12.512
HE'LL SING A SAD SONG
TO THE JURY

20:12.545 --> 20:13.813
PLAYING THE CRIPPLED MAN

20:13.846 --> 20:15.482
WHOSE LIFE IS ONCE AGAIN
BEING RUINED

20:15.515 --> 20:17.250
BY FALSE ALLEGATIONS.

20:17.284 --> 20:19.018
- JILL, HIS DNA
WAS ON THE PHOTO.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.687
- IT'S NOT ENOUGH.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.323
POSSESSION IS DEFINED
AS DOMINION AND CONTROL.

20:23.356 --> 20:24.624
A FINGERPRINT WOULD PROVE

20:24.657 --> 20:26.726
THAT UNDERWOOD HAD THE PHOTO
IN HIS HAND.

20:26.759 --> 20:29.596
FINDING IT IN HIS HOUSE
WOULD SHOW IT UNDER HIS CONTROL.

20:29.629 --> 20:31.498
ANYTHING LESS IS CIRCUMSTANTIAL.

20:31.531 --> 20:32.865
- ESPECIALLY WHEN HE WAS SAYING

20:32.899 --> 20:35.368
HIS DNA WAS FLYING
EVERY WHICH WAY BUT LOOSE.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.003
- SO YOU GET BALOGH ON THE STAND
TO TESTIFY

20:37.036 --> 20:39.506
THAT HE FOUND THE PHOTOS
IN UNDERWOOD'S HOME.

20:39.539 --> 20:42.375
- ELDON BALOGH WAS BEATEN
TO DEATH LAST NIGHT IN PRISON

20:42.409 --> 20:45.512
FOR BRAGGING ABOUT RAPING BRANDY
AND THOSE OTHER GIRLS.

20:45.545 --> 20:48.348
VOID THE ARREST.
LET HIM GO.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.285
- DIDN'T I TELL YA I'D BE
WALKING OUT A FREE MAN?

20:52.319 --> 20:53.553
- KEEP IT UP, UNDERWOOD.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.322
I'LL WRAP THAT OXYGEN LINE
AROUND YOUR NECK.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.624
- YOU COPS ARE ALL THE SAME.
YOU CAN'T MAKE THE CASE,

20:57.657 --> 21:00.593
SO YOU MAKE EMPTY THREATS.

21:00.627 --> 21:04.030
- I HOPE YOU DIE
A SLOW, PAINFUL DEATH.

21:04.063 --> 21:06.265
HAVE A NICE DAY.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.502
- TAXI!

21:13.706 --> 21:16.509
OH, MY GOODNESS, BRANDY!

21:16.543 --> 21:18.311
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

21:18.345 --> 21:21.648
YOU ARE STILL
A VERY BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

21:21.681 --> 21:22.982
- YOU TOLD THAT GUY
WHERE I WAS.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.617
- UNDERWOOD!
GET AWAY FROM HER!

21:24.651 --> 21:26.753
- I'M JUST TRYING TO TELL HER
NO HARD FEELINGS

21:26.786 --> 21:28.655
AFTER SO MANY YEARS!
- GET AWAY FROM HER,

21:28.688 --> 21:30.657
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

21:30.690 --> 21:31.991
- [vomiting]

21:39.766 --> 21:41.334
- I'M SO SORRY
I THREW UP ON YOU.

21:41.368 --> 21:43.736
- I NEEDED TO GET MY SUIT
DRY CLEANED ANYWAY.

21:46.673 --> 21:48.675
SO WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW UNDERWOOD?

21:48.708 --> 21:53.846
- 16 YEARS AGO.
AT THE TRIAL.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.648
AND THEN IT'S LIKE,
THERE HE WAS

21:55.682 --> 21:57.450
STANDING RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME,
AND I JUST...

21:57.484 --> 21:59.085
FELT LIKE I WAS TEN AGAIN.

21:59.118 --> 22:00.987
- WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU?

22:01.020 --> 22:02.622
- HE SAID I WAS STILL
BEAUTIFUL.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.491
AND HE CALLED ME BRANDY.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.526
- LARISSA, THE MAN WHO
ATTACKED YOU THE OTHER NIGHT,

22:06.559 --> 22:10.096
ELDON BALOGH, WAS MURDERED
LAST NIGHT IN JAIL.

22:10.129 --> 22:12.932
- HE'S DEAD?
- MM-HMM.

22:12.965 --> 22:15.435
NEVER BE ABLE TO HURT YOU
OR ANYONE ELSE AGAIN.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.504
- YEAH. BUT UNDERWOOD
IS STILL OUT THERE.

22:17.537 --> 22:20.072
- OH, WE'RE GONNA GET HIM TOO.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.608
- HOW? YOU CAN'T TRY HIM
AGAIN.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.410
- WE GOT A WARRANT
TO SEARCH HIS PLACE.

22:23.443 --> 22:26.345
WE FIND SOMETHING THERE,
WE'LL GET HIM ON A NEW CHARGE.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.582
- YOU KNOW,
MAYBE YOU CAN HELP US.

22:29.616 --> 22:31.484
- [exhales]

22:31.518 --> 22:33.119
ANYTHING.

22:33.152 --> 22:35.121
- REMEMBER DANIEL, THE BOY
IN THE MOVIES WITH YOU?

22:35.154 --> 22:37.557
IF WE COULD FIND HIM,

22:37.590 --> 22:39.426
WE COULD COUNT HIM
AS A NEW ACCUSER.

22:39.459 --> 22:41.127
- THEN UNDERWOOD
COULD BE CHARGED FOR THE CRIMES

22:41.160 --> 22:43.129
THAT HE COMMITTED
AGAINST BOTH OF YOU BACK THEN.

22:43.162 --> 22:45.665
- YOU GUYS REALIZE
I'VE SPENT MY ENTIRE LIFE

22:45.698 --> 22:47.700
TRYING TO FORGET ABOUT
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME,

22:47.734 --> 22:49.736
AND YOU JUST WANT ME
TO RELIVE IT?

22:49.769 --> 22:52.138
- NOT RELIVE.
JUST REMEMBER.

22:52.171 --> 22:54.507
MAYBE THERE'S SOME TINY
DETAILS YOU'VE FORGOTTEN.

22:54.541 --> 22:57.176
- SOMETHING THAT HE SAID
ABOUT HIS LIFE

22:57.209 --> 23:00.947
BEFORE HE WAS ABDUCTED OR...
MAYBE WHERE HE CAME FROM.

23:05.552 --> 23:09.422
- YOU KNOW, ALL I CAN REMEMBER
IS DANIEL'S SMILE...

23:09.456 --> 23:11.424
THE DAY THAT I GOT AWAY.

23:13.826 --> 23:16.663
- VICTIMS DEAL WITH THEIR TRAUMA
IN NUMEROUS WAYS.

23:16.696 --> 23:18.898
LARISSA HAS OBVIOUSLY
BUILT COGNITIVE WALLS

23:18.931 --> 23:20.967
BETWEEN THE PRESENT
AND HER VERY PAINFUL PAST.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.902
- IS THERE A WAY
TO BREAK THROUGH THEM?

23:22.935 --> 23:24.136
- HYPNOSIS IS AN OPTION,

23:24.170 --> 23:25.572
BUT IT'S OFTEN ATTACKED
ON THE STAND

23:25.605 --> 23:27.139
FOR BEING UNRELIABLE.

23:27.173 --> 23:28.908
- WE ONLY NEED LARISSA
TO HELP US FIND DANIEL,

23:28.941 --> 23:31.678
THE BOY WHO WAS IN
THE MOVIES WITH HER.

23:31.711 --> 23:34.180
- THE BRANDY SERIES
WAS MADE IN THE '90s,

23:34.213 --> 23:37.016
BUT IT DIDN'T MAKE IT
TO THE INTERNET UNTIL 2005.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.618
WHICH MEANS THAT
IT WASN'T AVAILABLE

23:38.651 --> 23:42.154
TO THE PROSECUTORS AT
THE ORIGINAL TRIAL IN 1996.

23:42.188 --> 23:43.623
- SO YOU'RE SAYING
THAT SHE PROBABLY

23:43.656 --> 23:46.526
NEVER EVEN SAW THE MOVIES
THAT SHE STARRED IN.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.861
- VIEWING THE IMAGES MIGHT
TRIGGER MORE SPECIFIC MEMORIES

23:48.895 --> 23:50.463
ABOUT WHERE
AND WHEN THEY WERE MADE.

23:50.497 --> 23:52.565
- IF IT DOESN'T DESTROY HER
IN THE PROCESS.

23:52.599 --> 23:55.201
- IT IS A RISK.

23:55.234 --> 23:57.737
ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE IT?

24:00.139 --> 24:03.943
[young Larissa]
- PLEASE. PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.778
I WANNA STOP.

24:05.812 --> 24:08.981
[distorted voice]
- TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES, BRANDY.

24:09.015 --> 24:11.884
- MY NAME'S NOT BRANDY.
- DO WHAT I SAY, BRANDY,

24:11.918 --> 24:15.622
OR COVENTRY WILL GET YOU.

24:15.655 --> 24:17.590
- PLEASE...
- DO IT!

24:17.624 --> 24:19.959
OR COVENTRY WILL KILL
YOUR MOMMY AND DADDY...

24:19.992 --> 24:21.127
- LARISSA.
- AND ALL YOUR BROTHERS

24:21.160 --> 24:22.729
AND SISTERS.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.797
- LARISSA, ARE YOU SURE
THAT YOU CAN DO THIS?

24:24.831 --> 24:28.167
- PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME.
PLEASE.

24:28.200 --> 24:32.004
- YES. IF IT'S THE ONLY
WAY TO STOP HIM...

24:34.841 --> 24:35.942
MY GOD.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.277
FORGOT ABOUT THAT DRESS.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.113
HE USED TO ALWAYS MAKE ME
WEAR IT, AND I HATED IT.

24:41.147 --> 24:44.984
- DO YOU REMEMBER
THOSE BOYS?

24:46.719 --> 24:49.121
- NO. THERE WERE SO MANY.

24:49.155 --> 24:52.659
- DO YOU REMEMBER HIM?

24:54.594 --> 24:57.129
- THAT'S DANIEL.

24:57.163 --> 24:59.498
- DO YOU REMEMBER THAT DAY?

25:02.268 --> 25:03.870
- NO.

25:03.903 --> 25:05.572
[sniffles]

25:05.605 --> 25:07.840
IT'S LIKE A DREAM,
YOU KNOW.

25:07.874 --> 25:10.577
UNDERWOOD DRUGGED ME.

25:10.610 --> 25:13.813
HE ALWAYS DID
BEFORE WE MADE A MOVIE.

25:13.846 --> 25:19.185
- CAN YOU TELL ME ANYTHING
SPECIFIC ABOUT THAT LOCATION?

25:19.218 --> 25:20.720
- NO.

25:23.723 --> 25:25.324
I JUST REMEMBER THE JARS.

25:25.357 --> 25:28.294
- THE JARS.
WHAT JARS?

25:28.327 --> 25:29.662
- THE PEANUT BUTTER.

25:29.696 --> 25:32.899
THAT'S LIKE ALL
UNDERWOOD FED US, AND...

25:32.932 --> 25:34.934
WHEN THEY WERE EMPTY,
DANIEL WOULD...

25:34.967 --> 25:36.636
WOULD BURY THEM
IN THE BACKYARD,

25:36.669 --> 25:39.706
AND HE'D PUT NOTES
TO HIS PARENTS IN THEM.

25:39.739 --> 25:42.675
- SO THEY WOULD
SOMEHOW FIND HIM.

25:43.943 --> 25:46.112
- YEAH. HE CALLED THEM
WISHING JARS,

25:46.145 --> 25:49.248
AND IF WE PRAYED THAT...

25:49.281 --> 25:52.218
WE MIGHT BE FOUND.

25:54.721 --> 25:56.823
- WHAT ELSE CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT DANIEL?

25:56.856 --> 26:00.026
- [sighs]

26:00.059 --> 26:02.094
I WORE THAT LEATHER
WRISTBAND

26:02.128 --> 26:04.731
THE DAY THAT I GOT AWAY,

26:04.764 --> 26:06.899
THE ONE THAT HE'S
WEARING RIGHT THERE,

26:06.933 --> 26:08.835
AND I BURIED IT
IN A JAR.

26:08.868 --> 26:09.936
- WHERE?

26:09.969 --> 26:11.938
- IN THE BACKYARD
OF MY FOSTER HOME

26:11.971 --> 26:13.640
AFTER I ESCAPED.

26:13.673 --> 26:16.876
- WHY DID YOU BURY
THE WRISTBAND?

26:16.909 --> 26:19.812
- 'CAUSE I MADE A WISH...

26:22.849 --> 26:25.752
THAT DANIEL MIGHT FIND ME.

26:31.357 --> 26:34.794
[chatter on police radio]

26:34.827 --> 26:37.263
- WHY COULDN'T THIS LEAD
BREAK IN THE SUMMER?

26:37.296 --> 26:39.231
- MUNCH, YOU JUST GRAB
A SHOVEL AND DIG.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.800
YOU MIGHT GET WARMER.

26:40.833 --> 26:43.202
- HEY. OVER HERE.

26:49.709 --> 26:51.711
THE WRISTBAND
WAS PRETTY DEGRADED,

26:51.744 --> 26:54.814
BUT I ISOLATED EXFOLIATED
SKIN CELLS.

26:54.847 --> 26:57.349
RAN IT THROUGH CODIS AND GOT
FIVE PARTIAL DNA MATCHES

26:57.383 --> 27:01.020
THAT HIT 11 MARKERS
WITH TWO VARYING INDETERMINATES.

27:01.053 --> 27:02.922
- DOES THAT MEAN
YOU FOUND DANIEL?

27:02.955 --> 27:05.725
- OF THE FIVE PARTIALS,
ONE BELONGED TO THIS BOY.

27:05.758 --> 27:08.094
REAL NAME DANIEL BROOKS.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.996
REPORTED MISSING
TO THE NATIONAL CENTER

27:10.029 --> 27:12.431
FOR MISSING AND EXPLOITED
CHILDREN IN '95

27:12.464 --> 27:13.700
WHEN HE WAS 12.

27:13.733 --> 27:15.134
- 16 YEARS AGO.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.236
WELL, WE DON'T KNOW
IF HE ESCAPED.

27:17.269 --> 27:19.906
- IF HE DIDN'T, IT'S A GOOD BET
THAT UNDERWOOD KILLED HIM.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.207
- WELL, THEN HE MUST HAVE
A TWIN.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.342
SAME DNA POPPED
FOR SHOPLIFTING AND PROSTITUTION

27:23.375 --> 27:26.813
IN 2001, 2003, AND 2006.

27:26.846 --> 27:29.015
- GET AN ADDRESS?
- PUBLIC RECORDS SHOW

27:29.048 --> 27:31.217
THAT DANIEL BROOKS NOW OWNS
AN ABANDONED FACTORY

27:31.250 --> 27:32.819
IN LOWER MANHATTAN.

27:34.854 --> 27:37.724
Benson: DANIEL BROOKS?

27:37.757 --> 27:39.091
DANIEL BROOKS.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.693
- I MEAN, YEAH,
THIS PLACE IS A DUMP,

27:40.727 --> 27:42.428
BUT HOW DOES A STREET KID
BUY SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

27:42.461 --> 27:44.764
- EL.

27:44.797 --> 27:48.234
- [sighs] DANIEL NEVER
GOT OUT OF THE BUSINESS.

27:51.971 --> 27:54.206
- LET'S GO!

27:54.240 --> 27:56.108
- MICHAEL!
- LET'S GO!

28:06.052 --> 28:07.720
- HEY, HEY...

28:07.754 --> 28:08.955
HONEY, ARE YOU OKAY?

28:08.988 --> 28:12.024
- YES. DANIEL TOOK MICHAEL
AWAY.

28:14.894 --> 28:16.863
- IS IT COVENTRY?
- YES! THEY'LL KILL US

28:16.896 --> 28:18.765
UNLESS YOU DO EVERYTHING
I SAY!

28:23.169 --> 28:25.504
STAY BACK!

28:25.537 --> 28:26.939
- NO, DON'T!

28:26.973 --> 28:29.441
[crying]

28:29.475 --> 28:32.111
- PUT THE BOY DOWN.
- DO YOU WANNA SAVE HIM?

28:32.144 --> 28:34.480
BACK OFF!
- [crying] NO! NO!

28:34.513 --> 28:36.348
NO, DON'T!
- I'M BACKING OFF.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.951
- [whimpering]

28:38.985 --> 28:40.186
- DANIEL.

28:41.954 --> 28:46.458
DANIEL, I'M SORRY NOBODY
WAS THERE TO SAVE YOU.

28:46.492 --> 28:48.928
AND RIGHT NOW,
YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

28:48.961 --> 28:51.230
- I'VE NEVER HAD A CHOICE.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.135
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU LOVE
THAT BOY.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.772
YOU DON'T WANT TO HURT HIM.

28:59.806 --> 29:02.341
HE'S INNOCENT,
JUST LIKE YOU WERE, DANIEL.

29:05.011 --> 29:08.014
YOU HAVE A CHANCE TO TAKE
CARE OF HIM RIGHT NOW.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.018
SAVE HIM.

29:14.053 --> 29:16.022
SAVE HIM.

29:24.030 --> 29:27.299
COME HERE.
- [whimpering]

29:29.468 --> 29:31.103
- WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

29:31.137 --> 29:35.274
- TO GET JUSTICE
FOR THE GIRL WHO PLAYED BRANDY.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.376
AND FOR YOU.

29:37.409 --> 29:39.879
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

29:39.912 --> 29:42.982
- THE MAN WHO HURT YOU
AND BRANDY.

29:43.015 --> 29:45.852
ORVILLE UNDERWOOD.
- UNDERWOOD?

29:45.885 --> 29:47.954
I DON'T KNOW WHO THAT IS.

29:51.590 --> 29:54.026
- THAT'S YOU, DANIEL...

29:54.060 --> 29:56.062
AS A BOY.

29:58.998 --> 30:02.134
- THE KID IN THIS PICTURE...

30:02.168 --> 30:05.071
THAT'S NOT ME ANYMORE.

30:05.104 --> 30:07.306
- YOU DISASSOCIATED YOURSELF

30:07.339 --> 30:09.308
FROM EVERYTHING
THAT UNDERWOOD MADE YOU DO.

30:09.341 --> 30:12.411
DANIEL, THAT'S YOU.

30:12.444 --> 30:17.083
THAT IS A BOY WHOSE CHILDHOOD
WAS STOLEN FROM HIM.

30:17.116 --> 30:19.551
- AND I'M NOTHING NOW.

30:19.585 --> 30:22.621
- YOU'RE LIKE ALL THE CHILDREN
IN THESE MOVIES--

30:22.654 --> 30:25.057
A VICTIM.

30:26.558 --> 30:29.929
- I WAS A VICTIM.

30:29.962 --> 30:32.865
BUT I'M NOT ANYMORE.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.408
- POOR BASTARD.

30:42.441 --> 30:43.642
IT'S ALMOST LIKE HE'S SOULLESS.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.477
- WELL, WE WAS ABDUCTED.
HE ADAPTED TO SURVIVE.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.313
- HE DID.

30:47.346 --> 30:50.616
THEN HE MADE HIS OWN
CHOICES AFTER THAT.

30:50.649 --> 30:53.219
- DANIEL'S ABUSE
AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE

30:53.252 --> 30:55.321
IS TANTAMOUNT
TO BEING BRAINWASHED.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.323
HIS ENTIRE WORLDVIEW
WAS ALTERED

30:57.356 --> 30:58.490
AFTER UNDERWOOD
GOT HIS HANDS ON HIM.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.059
- WELL, WE'VE SEEN IT BEFORE.

31:00.092 --> 31:02.061
RESCUED CHILDREN WHO DIDN'T
KNOW THEIR REAL NAMES

31:02.094 --> 31:03.495
OR RECOGNIZE PHOTOS
OF THEMSELVES

31:03.529 --> 31:05.397
MONTHS AFTER THEY WERE
ABDUCTED.

31:05.431 --> 31:06.899
- DIDN'T TURN THEM
INTO RAPISTS.

31:06.933 --> 31:08.267
- BUT DANIEL'S EVOLUTION

31:08.300 --> 31:09.368
FROM VICTIM TO VICTIMIZER

31:09.401 --> 31:11.303
COULD BE HIS WAY
OF TAKING CONTROL

31:11.337 --> 31:13.139
OVER HIS OWN
SCREWED UP LIFE.

31:13.172 --> 31:14.373
- HEATHER AND MICHAEL

31:14.406 --> 31:16.976
ARE GONNA NEED
A WHOLE LOT OF HELP.

31:17.009 --> 31:19.345
- YEAH. BUT WITH THERAPY,
THEY HAVE A CHANCE.

31:19.378 --> 31:20.612
EXCUSE ME.

31:20.646 --> 31:22.281
- NOW, WHAT ABOUT LARISSA?

31:22.314 --> 31:24.183
IF WE CAN'T GET DANIEL
TO TESTIFY,

31:24.216 --> 31:25.584
WE GOT NOTHING ON UNDERWOOD.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.053
- DON'T NEED DANIEL
ANYMORE.

31:27.086 --> 31:28.487
- FOUND SOMETHING
AT UNDERWOOD'S?

31:28.520 --> 31:30.256
- A PANEL
IN THE BASEMENT WALL,

31:30.289 --> 31:32.424
AND THE HIDDEN TREASURE
INSIDE.

31:32.458 --> 31:36.262
- "THE BEAUTY
OF A CHILD'S LOVE, BY O.U."

31:36.295 --> 31:38.430
- "CHASING BRANDY."

31:38.464 --> 31:41.167
"HOW I FOUND BRANDY,
AND HOW YOU CAN TOO."

31:41.200 --> 31:43.269
- UNDERWOOD STARTED
POSTING THESE TO CHAT ROOMS

31:43.302 --> 31:45.304
NOT LONG AFTER
THAT FIRST TRIAL.

31:45.337 --> 31:47.974
PERVS ALL OVER THE WORLD BEEN
GETTIN' OFF TO THEM FOR YEARS.

31:48.007 --> 31:49.675
- HE KNEW HE COULDN'T RISK
MAKING FILMS ANYMORE,

31:49.708 --> 31:52.378
SO HE TURNED HIS HAND
TO WRITING KIDDIE PORN NOVELS.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.646
- JILL SAID
HE WAS A SMART GUY.

31:54.680 --> 31:58.150
THIS ONE IS A DISGUSTING
"HOW TO" FOR PEDOPHILES.

31:58.184 --> 31:59.585
- I GOTTA SAY,
THIS IS THE ONE TIME

31:59.618 --> 32:01.053
I DISAGREE
WITH THE FIRST AMENDMENT.

32:01.087 --> 32:02.354
THIS GARBAGE
SHOULD BE BANNED.

32:02.388 --> 32:04.656
- PERVERTS HIDING BEHIND
FREE SPEECH

32:04.690 --> 32:05.992
AND CALLING IT LITERATURE.

32:06.025 --> 32:08.060
AS LONG AS THERE'S NO PICTURES,

32:08.094 --> 32:09.528
THERE'S NO WAY
WE CAN TOUCH UNDERWOOD.

32:09.561 --> 32:11.730
- MAYBE WE CAN.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.232
"WHEN YOU FIND YOUR BRANDY,

32:13.265 --> 32:15.667
"GIVE HER SOMETHING TO MAKE HER
FEEL REAL GOOD.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.669
"DRESS HER UP.
FIX HER HAIR.

32:17.703 --> 32:20.506
MAKE HER THE LITTLE GIRL
THAT YOU WANT TO LOVE."

32:20.539 --> 32:24.376
BALOGH FOLLOWED UNDERWOOD'S
DIRECTIONS TO RAPING LARISSA.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.445
HARDWICKE CAN USE THIS
TO GET HIM.

32:28.580 --> 32:31.317
- THIS BOOK AND THE OTHERS
THE POLICE FOUND

32:31.350 --> 32:32.551
IN MR. UNDERWOOD'S HOME

32:32.584 --> 32:35.121
PROVE CONSPIRACY
TO COMMIT RAPE.

32:35.154 --> 32:37.189
- FALSEHOOD AFTER FALSEHOOD.

32:37.223 --> 32:39.091
- YOU'RE SAYING THE BEAUTY
OF A CHILD'S LOVE,

32:39.125 --> 32:41.027
DAYS AT CAMP,
NIGHTS OF PASSION

32:41.060 --> 32:42.428
AREN'T CHILD PORN?

32:42.461 --> 32:45.631
- THEY ARE FICTION PROTECTED
UNDER THE FIRST AMENDMENT,

32:45.664 --> 32:46.632
NOT CHILD PORNOGRAPHY.

32:46.665 --> 32:48.500
NO PHOTOS, NO DRAWINGS.

32:48.534 --> 32:50.702
NOTHING BUT WORDS ON PAPER.

32:50.736 --> 32:53.405
AND AS FICTION,
NO CHILDREN WERE HARMED

32:53.439 --> 32:55.541
IN THE WRITING OF THESE BOOKS.

32:55.574 --> 32:56.708
- TELL THAT TO LARISSA WELSH.

32:56.742 --> 32:58.610
SHE WAS VIOLENTLY
RAPED BY A MAN

32:58.644 --> 33:00.712
FOLLOWING THE EXPLICIT
INSTRUCTIONS

33:00.746 --> 33:04.250
PROVIDED IN HOW I FOUND BRANDY.
HOW YOU CAN TOO.

33:04.283 --> 33:06.685
- THIS IS YOUR CONSPIRACY
ARGUMENT, MS. HARDWICKE?

33:06.718 --> 33:08.354
- MR. UNDERWOOD
PUBLISHED THIS BOOK

33:08.387 --> 33:10.322
AS A HOW-TO MANUAL.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.424
WE FOUND A DOWNLOADED COPY
IN THE HOME OF ELDON BALOGH,

33:12.458 --> 33:14.593
MISS WELSH'S RAPIST,
WITH PASSAGES HIGHLIGHTED

33:14.626 --> 33:17.696
THAT SPECIFICALLY RELATE
TO THE WAY SHE WAS ATTACKED.

33:17.729 --> 33:20.432
- AND MR. BALOGH
WILL CONFIRM THIS?

33:20.466 --> 33:22.701
- UNFORTUNATELY,
HE WAS KILLED IN PRISON

33:22.734 --> 33:24.636
BEFORE HIS TESTIMONY
COULD BE OBTAINED.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.106
BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION

33:27.139 --> 33:29.241
HE FOLLOWED MR. UNDERWOOD'S
WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS.

33:29.275 --> 33:32.311
"HOW YOU SHOULD DRESS HER.
HOW YOU SHOULD DRUG HER."

33:32.344 --> 33:35.314
IT EVEN COMMANDED BALOGH
TO VIDEOTAPE THE ASSAULT

33:35.347 --> 33:38.150
BECAUSE "YOU'LL WANT THE
MEMORIES OF BRANDY'S SWEETNESS

33:38.184 --> 33:39.585
TO LAST A LIFETIME."

33:39.618 --> 33:42.121
- I...COMMANDED BALOGH?

33:42.154 --> 33:44.556
WHERE'S HIS NAME
WRITTEN IN THAT BOOK?

33:44.590 --> 33:48.160
AND IF I WROTE ABOUT A GIRL
NAMED BRANDY,

33:48.194 --> 33:51.463
WHY IS THE YOUNG WOMAN
WHO WAS REGRETTABLY ATTACKED

33:51.497 --> 33:53.099
NAMED LARISSA?

33:53.132 --> 33:54.833
RIGHT THERE,
YOUR THEORY FALLS APART.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.402
- I THINK A JURY WILL FIND
THE CONNECTION

33:56.435 --> 33:59.338
BETWEEN MISS WELSH AND BRANDY
TO BE QUITE CONVINCING.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.274
- YOUR HONOR, HER CASE FAILS
BY ALL CRITERIA.

34:02.308 --> 34:04.443
CONSPIRACY REQUIRES
TWO OR MORE PEOPLE

34:04.476 --> 34:06.678
TO ACTUALLY AGREE
AND INTEND TO AGREE

34:06.712 --> 34:08.314
TO COMMIT A CRIME.

34:08.347 --> 34:10.149
UNLESS MS. HARDWICKE
IS A MIND READER,

34:10.182 --> 34:12.351
SHE IS TALKING
OUT OF HER ASS!

34:12.384 --> 34:13.785
- COUNSELOR,
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER.

34:13.819 --> 34:16.155
- YOUR HONOR, I CAN TAKE
ANYTHING THIS TOAD CAN DISH OUT.

34:16.188 --> 34:17.556
- I'M ONLY DEFENDING MYSELF
AGAINST HER LIES!

34:17.589 --> 34:18.557
[judge pounds gavel]

34:18.590 --> 34:20.859
- BOTH OF YA SHUT UP.

34:20.892 --> 34:24.496
GIVE ME 15 MINUTES
TO CONSIDER THE FACTS.

34:30.669 --> 34:33.405
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CASES
THAT MAKES ME WONDER

34:33.439 --> 34:36.342
IF IT'S TIME TO RETIRE.

34:36.375 --> 34:38.510
AFTER REVIEW,

34:38.544 --> 34:41.347
AND DESPITE STRONG
PERSONAL CONTEMPT

34:41.380 --> 34:45.151
FOR THE DEFENDANT'S
ODIOUS LITERARY EFFORTS,

34:45.184 --> 34:46.752
THIS COURT HAS NO CHOICE

34:46.785 --> 34:49.855
BUT TO GRANT THE DEFENSE
MOTION FOR DISMISSAL.

34:49.888 --> 34:51.523
- YOUR HONOR--
- MS. HARDWICKE,

34:51.557 --> 34:55.194
SPEND YOUR ENERGY BUILDING
A CONVINCING PRIMA FACIE CASE

34:55.227 --> 34:56.495
FOR YOUR CHARGES.

34:56.528 --> 34:58.864
THE ARGUMENT FOR CONSPIRACY

34:58.897 --> 35:01.267
FAILS TO PRESENT
ANY MEETING OF THE MINDS

35:01.300 --> 35:03.269
BETWEEN THE DEFENDANT

35:03.302 --> 35:06.272
AND HIS SUPPOSED COCONSPIRATOR

35:06.305 --> 35:10.142
WHO IS NOW UNABLE
TO SPEAK FOR HIMSELF.

35:10.176 --> 35:13.679
YOU WANNA TRY AGAIN...
I'M ALL EARS.

35:13.712 --> 35:16.315
BUT FOR NOW, WE'RE DONE.

35:16.348 --> 35:17.849
[taps gavel]

35:23.489 --> 35:27.293
- GOOD-BYE, LADIES...

35:27.326 --> 35:29.695
AS ALWAYS.

35:29.728 --> 35:32.731
- LARISSA, DO NOT TURN
AND LOOK AT THAT MONSTER.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.366
- PLEASE.

35:34.400 --> 35:37.569
HE CANNOT GET AWAY AGAIN.

35:37.603 --> 35:39.505
- WE'LL FIGURE OUT
SOME OTHER WAY.

35:39.538 --> 35:40.539
I PROMISE.

35:40.572 --> 35:42.908
- THERE'S ONLY ONE OTHER WAY.

35:42.941 --> 35:45.244
WE HAVE TO GET DANIEL
TO TESTIFY.

35:45.277 --> 35:48.480
- BUT HE WON'T.

35:48.514 --> 35:50.649
HE'S NOT THE SAME PERSON
YOU USED TO KNOW.

35:50.682 --> 35:53.952
- PLEASE...LET ME
TALK TO DANIEL.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.288
I KNOW I CAN
GET THROUGH TO HIM.

35:58.624 --> 36:00.759
[buzzer]

36:16.942 --> 36:18.210
DANIEL.

36:18.244 --> 36:21.347
HI.

36:25.884 --> 36:29.521
DANIEL, WHAT HAPPENED?

36:29.555 --> 36:32.824
HOW COULD YOU
GROW UP TO BE LIKE THEM?

36:32.858 --> 36:35.561
YOU WERE MY SAVIOR.

36:35.594 --> 36:37.629
- YOU NEVER CAME BACK
FOR ME.

36:37.663 --> 36:40.232
- I TRIED.
- NOT HARD ENOUGH.

36:46.905 --> 36:49.575
- SO NOW YOU WANNA
HURT MORE CHILDREN...

36:49.608 --> 36:52.444
FOR PAYBACK?

36:52.478 --> 36:54.846
- NO.

36:54.880 --> 36:57.749
I LOVE ALL MY KIDS.

36:59.551 --> 37:02.421
- DANIEL, YOU'RE FORCING THEM
TO MAKE MOVIES.

37:02.454 --> 37:04.823
- IT'S BETTER
THAN THE LIVES THEY HAD.

37:04.856 --> 37:08.627
THEY'RE THROWAWAYS.

37:08.660 --> 37:11.297
WITH MY MOVIES,
THEY GET TO FEEL MY LOVE

37:11.330 --> 37:13.799
AND THE LOVE OF OUR FAMILY.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.837
- DANIEL...

37:18.870 --> 37:21.740
YOU HAD A FAMILY.

37:21.773 --> 37:25.677
UNDERWOOD STOLE YOU
FROM THEM.

37:25.711 --> 37:28.714
HE DID IT TO ME TOO.

37:28.747 --> 37:33.319
PLEASE...

37:33.352 --> 37:34.786
THE POLICE
REALLY NEED YOUR HELP.

37:34.820 --> 37:36.422
I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP.

37:36.455 --> 37:39.991
WE GOTTA PUT HIM AWAY
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

37:40.025 --> 37:41.960
- YOU WANNA PUNISH HIM.

37:41.993 --> 37:44.663
WHAT WILL THAT CHANGE?

37:44.696 --> 37:46.998
- HE DESERVES TO BE PUNISHED.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.970
- WE'RE BROKEN.

37:52.003 --> 37:54.673
NOTHING CAN FIX US.

37:54.706 --> 37:57.776
- I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

38:01.547 --> 38:03.915
- IT'S BEEN 15 YEARS,
LARISSA.

38:05.817 --> 38:08.687
ARE YOU FIXED YET?

38:18.497 --> 38:20.866
[whispering]

38:30.509 --> 38:32.778
[door unlocks, opens]

38:39.518 --> 38:40.619
- SO IT'S OVER.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.654
WE'LL LICK OUR WOUNDS
AND MOVE ON.

38:42.688 --> 38:44.390
- IT'S THAT EASY?
- DIDN'T SAY IT WAS EASY.

38:44.423 --> 38:46.358
BUT WHAT CHOICE DO WE HAVE?

38:46.392 --> 38:47.893
- YOU GUYS ARE BETTER
AT THIS THAN I AM.

38:47.926 --> 38:49.661
- NO. WE'VE JUST BEEN
DOING IT LONGER.

38:49.695 --> 38:50.729
THE GOOD NEWS IS--

38:50.762 --> 38:52.731
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TIME
TO WORRY ABOUT FAILURE.

38:52.764 --> 38:54.766
- BAD NEWS IS THAT'S BECAUSE
THERE'S ALWAYS...

38:54.800 --> 38:55.901
A NEW VICTIM NEEDING HELP.

38:55.934 --> 38:56.902
DETECTIVE STABLER.

38:56.935 --> 38:58.904
- I'M SURE I'LL BE SEEING
YOU TWO TOMORROW.

38:58.937 --> 39:01.773
- GOOD NIGHT.
- HOLD ON. OKAY.

39:01.807 --> 39:03.809
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

39:03.842 --> 39:06.745
911 RECEIVED A CALL
FROM UNDERWOOD.

39:06.778 --> 39:08.046
HE SAID A GIRL NAMED BRANDY

39:08.079 --> 39:09.715
BARGED INTO HIS HOUSE
WITH A GUN.

39:09.748 --> 39:11.049
THEN THE LINE WENT DEAD.

39:11.082 --> 39:13.985
WHERE ARE THEY?
- IN THE BEDROOM.

39:19.925 --> 39:21.793
- BUT I LOVE YOU, BRANDY.
- SHUT UP!

39:21.827 --> 39:23.128
- LARISSA?

39:23.161 --> 39:24.763
- I NEVER MEANT TO HURT YOU.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.432
- LARISSA,
IT'S DETECTIVE BENSON.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.066
- DON'T, DON'T, BRANDY!
- PLEASE, THIS IS NOT THE WAY

39:28.099 --> 39:30.969
TO HANDLE THIS--
[gunshots]

39:33.972 --> 39:35.841
- LARISSA, DROP THE GUN.

39:39.177 --> 39:41.179
LARISSA, DROP THE GUN.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.814
LARISSA, DROP THE GUN.

39:50.088 --> 39:52.724
OKAY.
- I...

39:52.758 --> 39:54.860
I HAD TO.
I HAD TO.

39:54.893 --> 39:58.930
[child crying]

40:03.602 --> 40:06.605
[crying continues]

40:13.779 --> 40:15.847
- AT RIKERS, DANIEL TOLD ME

40:15.881 --> 40:17.849
THAT UNDERWOOD
WAS STILL DOING IT.

40:17.883 --> 40:21.920
[girl hyperventilating]

40:21.953 --> 40:24.890
- HE HURT ME.
[sobbing

40:48.246 --> 40:50.716
- SO?
WHAT DO WE WANNA DO?

40:52.651 --> 40:55.654
- SHE USED DEADLY FORCE TO STOP
UNDERWOOD FROM RAPING CHRISTINA.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.623
THAT'S DEFENSE
OF A THIRD PERSON.

40:57.656 --> 40:59.224
SHE WALKS.

40:59.257 --> 41:01.560
- WORKS FOR ME.

41:06.832 --> 41:08.934
- YOU GUYS GONNA ARREST ME NOW?

41:08.967 --> 41:10.736
- NO.

41:10.769 --> 41:12.838
YOU SAVED CHRISTINA.

41:14.840 --> 41:17.208
IT'S OVER.

41:23.949 --> 41:25.951
- MAYBE.
