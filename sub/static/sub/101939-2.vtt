There's no problem, Sensei.

is about being aggressive, all right?

If you're not aggressive,
you're being a pussy,

10:19.201 --> 10:21.078
All right,
everybody get out of here right now.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.289
So sorry, Dad.
I had no idea you'd be home so early.

10:23.372 --> 10:25.499
It doesn't make a difference
what time I get home, Sam.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.127
You think we want strangers
in the backyard making a mess?

10:28.210 --> 10:31.714
-They're not strangers. They're friends.
-[Daniel] Yeah, some friends.

10:32.089 --> 10:33.591
Is he wearing my bathing suit?

10:33.674 --> 10:36.510
Wait. Are all of you guys
wearing my bathing suits?

10:36.594 --> 10:38.721
All right, listen, party's over. Let's go.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.348
Take the suits off and leave.

10:40.431 --> 10:43.559
No, not out here, genius.
In the pool house.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.477
[mom] Daniel.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.771
-Hey, can I talk to you inside?
-Yeah, did...

10:49.357 --> 10:50.983
[Daniel] <i>I'm not acting irrationally.</i>

10:51.067 --> 10:54.070
I'm acting like a responsible parent
who cares about his kid.

10:54.153 --> 10:55.821
OK, we both care about our kid.

10:55.905 --> 10:58.532
Embarrassing Sam in front of her friends
isn't helping matters.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.576
I don't like these new friends.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.495
It's not like Samantha.

11:02.578 --> 11:05.081
Why can't she be at robot camp with Aisha?

11:05.164 --> 11:06.957
'Cause she doesn't wanna be a nerd.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.834
-[sighs]
-Look, I remember what it was like

11:08.918 --> 11:11.087
being part of a clique
other kids made fun of.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.963
Believe me, girls can be really cruel.

11:13.047 --> 11:15.925
Listen, I know a thing or two
about cruel, OK?

11:16.008 --> 11:17.927
I… I was pushed off a cliff on my bike.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.012
There's nothing wrong
with Sam wanting to be popular.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.472
[stammers] Popular is fine.

11:21.931 --> 11:25.518
I just don't want her turning
into one of these privileged Encino brats.

11:25.601 --> 11:26.686
Neither do I,

11:27.269 --> 11:29.772
but keep throwing her friends
out of the house,

11:29.855 --> 11:32.149
see where that gets
your relationship with your daughter.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.317
[toilet flushes]

11:33.401 --> 11:34.735
[Brucks] Whoo!

11:34.819 --> 11:36.612
Skinny dips and bong rips.

11:38.406 --> 11:39.365
Whoa!

11:39.782 --> 11:42.618
Oh, you're that bonsai guy
on those commercials!

11:43.244 --> 11:45.746
[sniffles wetly]
Wait. Where'd everybody go?

12:07.435 --> 12:08.436
[sighs]

12:16.527 --> 12:19.905
Wish you were here to give me
some of that Miyagi wisdom right now.

12:32.501 --> 12:33.919
-[Daniel] <i>Hai!</i>
-[Samantha] <i>Hai!</i>

12:34.003 --> 12:35.087
<i>Hyah!</i>

12:35.171 --> 12:36.338
-Hey!
-I did it!

12:36.422 --> 12:38.215
Good. Good job, kiddo.

12:38.299 --> 12:41.343
[Sam] Now, if anybody comes for me,
I'll kick their butts.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.804
Well, always remember
our first lesson, you.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.140
This is for self-defense only.

12:47.349 --> 12:49.185
True karate is here.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.521
It's here, but never here.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.023
My tummy?

12:54.899 --> 12:56.901
[sighs] Yeah, something like that.

12:56.984 --> 12:58.068
Get over here, you.

12:58.694 --> 12:59.904
[affectionate groan]

12:59.987 --> 13:01.947
But never give up your defense.

13:02.031 --> 13:04.784
Beware the spinning hug move!

13:04.867 --> 13:06.035
[Samantha] Ah!

13:06.118 --> 13:07.036
<i>Daddy!</i>

13:13.417 --> 13:15.920
<i>I need one of you bitches</i>
<i>to pick me up for school tomorrow.</i>

13:16.003 --> 13:19.173
-How is your car still not ready?
<i>-My dad's getting me a new one.</i>

13:19.256 --> 13:22.259
<i>He felt bad about that "deer"</i>
<i>that jacked up the Range Rover.</i>

13:22.802 --> 13:25.805
<i>-You hit a deer?</i>
-No, Moon, she rear-ended that guy's car.

13:25.888 --> 13:28.015
<i>Oh yeah, right. </i>[chuckles]

13:28.098 --> 13:31.644
I'm still kind of freaked out about it.
I feel guilty about just driving away.

13:31.727 --> 13:33.103
<i>From that meth-head zombie?</i>

13:33.187 --> 13:35.397
<i>If I hadn't gunned it,</i>
<i>we'd be chained up in his basement.</i>

13:35.481 --> 13:37.066
[Daniel] Sam, you got a sec?

13:37.149 --> 13:39.652
I didn't know you were talking
to your friends. I'll come back.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.445
No! Uh, just wait a second.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.156
-I can pick you up in the morning. Yes.
<i>-Oh, good.</i>

13:46.158 --> 13:47.451
I just wanted to say--

13:47.535 --> 13:49.328
No. Look, Dad...

13:49.411 --> 13:51.997
[exhales slowly]
…I'm really sorry about today.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.791
I shouldn't have invited everyone over

13:53.874 --> 13:56.836
-without asking you and Mom first.
-Well, maybe I overreacted a little.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.296
Well, maybe more than a little, OK?

13:59.380 --> 14:02.758
Just have those guys
bring their own trunks from now on, OK?

14:03.259 --> 14:04.093
Deal. [chuckles]

14:05.261 --> 14:06.095
So...

14:06.679 --> 14:07.721
these guys...

14:09.265 --> 14:10.724
Anyone I have to worry about?

14:11.225 --> 14:13.435
-You don't have to worry, Dad.
-[scoffs lightly]

14:14.061 --> 14:17.731
But there is this one guy, Kyler.
He and I have been texting a little bit.

14:17.815 --> 14:18.816
Texting.

14:19.567 --> 14:20.401
Right.

14:21.485 --> 14:22.736
Just words though?

14:23.362 --> 14:24.530
What do you mea…

14:24.905 --> 14:27.449
Oh gross. No, no! Just...
Just words, Dad.

14:27.533 --> 14:28.993
Good. That's good.

14:30.327 --> 14:34.206
So Kyler, how about we invite him over
for dinner on Friday?

14:34.290 --> 14:36.792
You want me to invite Kyler
to Friday family dinner?

14:36.876 --> 14:38.794
I'm not talking about
walking you down the aisle.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.671
-We're gonna give the kid a meal.
-[chuckles]

14:40.754 --> 14:44.508
Besides, your brother has a sleepover.
It'll be a good chance to get to know him.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.760
OK. I'll see if he can come.

14:46.844 --> 14:47.803
Great.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.806
You don't have to worry about me, Dad.
I can handle myself.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.725
-I'm a LaRusso.
-[chuckles]

14:52.808 --> 14:54.143
That's my girl.

14:54.226 --> 14:55.394
Jersey tough.

14:57.521 --> 14:58.606
[server] Here you go.

15:00.357 --> 15:02.359
[boy 1] Dude, right there. Come on!

15:02.443 --> 15:04.236
[boy 2] It's almost out. Come on.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.529
You can beat this.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.031
[Kyler] Would you? Wait!

15:22.755 --> 15:24.340
-Is it cool if I sit here?
-[boy 3] Ooh.

15:24.423 --> 15:27.509
Sorry, table's really blowing up
right now.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.553
I can put you on the waitlist,

15:29.637 --> 15:32.222
but it's probably next semester
at the earliest.

15:33.349 --> 15:34.308
OK.

15:34.391 --> 15:35.684
No, I'm kidding. Sit.

15:39.563 --> 15:40.481
Miguel.

15:40.564 --> 15:42.441
Demetri. This is Eli.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.111
He's a man of few words.

15:54.411 --> 15:55.996
Dude, don't torture yourself.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.207
-Those are the rich girls.
-Hey. [Moon laughs]

15:58.290 --> 15:59.166
[girl] Hey.

16:01.335 --> 16:02.878
Do you ever talk to them or...

16:02.962 --> 16:04.338
Oh yeah! All the time.

16:04.421 --> 16:07.841
We hang out after school,
make out, give each other hand jobs.

16:07.925 --> 16:09.593
Eli here is the homecoming king.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.388
Gets laid more than anyone.
Isn't that right, Eli?

16:12.471 --> 16:13.472
Talk to them?

16:13.973 --> 16:15.808
You realize
what table you're sitting at, right?

16:15.891 --> 16:19.895
You've pretty much signed away all hopes
of losing your virginity before college.

16:21.188 --> 16:23.232
[Eli] Oh shit, Yasmine's looking at us.

16:24.149 --> 16:27.111
-Probably just making fun of me.
-I don't think she's making fun of you.

16:27.194 --> 16:30.406
I mean, just because they're hot
doesn't mean they're mean.

16:31.031 --> 16:33.993
Oh my God, you guys.
You see that guy over there

16:34.076 --> 16:36.245
who looks like
he went down on a lawnmower?

16:36.328 --> 16:38.998
He's literally wearing the ugliest sweater
I've ever seen.

16:39.081 --> 16:40.457
[Moon snickers]

16:40.541 --> 16:42.001
That is so wrong. [chuckles]

16:42.501 --> 16:44.712
Speaking of wrong, check out Fug-lisha.

16:45.129 --> 16:47.047
She looks like she ate a picnic table.

16:47.464 --> 16:50.009
[Yasmine, Moon laughing]

16:52.886 --> 16:53.846
[mock whimpering]

16:53.929 --> 16:56.348
I don't care if Yasmine is
the meanest girl at school.

16:56.432 --> 16:59.643
I'd kill both of you
just to get her to spit in my face.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.395
If you don't make a move,
you'll never have a shot.

17:01.478 --> 17:05.315
True, but I'll also never suffer
a humiliating rejection.

17:05.399 --> 17:07.109
I'm at peace with my depression.

17:07.651 --> 17:09.486
Last thing I need to be is suicidal.

17:16.952 --> 17:18.203
What are you doing?

17:18.287 --> 17:19.580
Striking first.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.249
Oh shit.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.085
Hope we don't get hit with the shrapnel.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.296
[suspenseful music plays]

17:33.427 --> 17:34.887
-What's up, ladies?
-[Yasmine scoffs]

17:34.970 --> 17:36.722
[Brucks] Moon, I saw you cheering earlier.

17:36.805 --> 17:38.766
[Kyler] Hey, Sam, looking beautiful.

17:42.019 --> 17:42.853
[laughs]

17:44.730 --> 17:47.649
See you later, 'Rhea. [Brucks laughs]

17:49.401 --> 17:50.569
So, how'd it go?

17:52.613 --> 17:54.907
[Johnny] <i>Can't strike first</i>
<i>if you don't know how to strike.</i>

17:55.491 --> 17:57.951
The cobra strike is composed of two parts:

17:58.035 --> 18:00.662
the lunge,
which requires the use of the whole body,

18:01.413 --> 18:02.539
and the bite,

18:02.623 --> 18:04.958
which is everything that happens
after you make contact.

18:05.042 --> 18:08.045
All right? You don't stop here
where knuckle hits the bone.

18:08.128 --> 18:09.338
You punch <i>through </i>the bone,

18:09.421 --> 18:12.424
like the guy you really wanna hit
is standing behind this asshole.

18:12.966 --> 18:13.842
All right?

18:13.926 --> 18:14.760
[sharp exhale]

18:14.843 --> 18:15.761
<i>Hyah!</i>

18:17.012 --> 18:17.930
All right?

18:18.013 --> 18:21.475
Strike here, you bloody his nose.
Strike here, you break his teeth.

18:21.558 --> 18:24.269
Strike here,
you could severely damage his trachea.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.940
Obviously,
that's only for extreme situations.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.566
All right, line up.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.860
-OK.
-Focus. I want you to practice.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.487
-[phone ringing]
-[exhales]

18:34.196 --> 18:36.281
Keep practicing. Punch through the dummy.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.328
Hello?

18:41.411 --> 18:42.704
Is this Mr. Lawrence?

18:43.580 --> 18:44.498
Yes.

18:44.581 --> 18:47.876
This is Carla Jenkins,
the vice principal at North Hills High.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.296
I have you listed as an emergency contact
for Robby Keene.

18:52.381 --> 18:55.467
Uh, yeah, I'm his father,
but you're supposed to call his mom.

18:55.551 --> 18:58.137
I already called her.
She's not picking up.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.763
[sighs] Right, big surprise.

19:00.389 --> 19:01.932
All right. What'd he do this time?

19:02.391 --> 19:04.184
We found him with Molly.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.477
[Johnny] <i>Who… Who's Molly?</i>

19:05.561 --> 19:07.479
Is that some chick he's hooking up with?

19:07.563 --> 19:09.898
It's an illegal drug, Mr. Lawrence.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.067
All right, put my kid on the phone.

19:15.946 --> 19:17.197
[Robby clears throat]

19:18.407 --> 19:20.534
-What do you want?
<i>-Robby, what the hell?</i>

19:20.617 --> 19:23.745
You're doing drugs?
You wanna flush your life down the toilet?

19:23.829 --> 19:25.581
[snickers] Like you're one to talk.

19:25.664 --> 19:28.167
Don't try to play dad now.
You're a pathetic loser.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.008
[Carla] Um...

19:36.091 --> 19:38.886
I think maybe
I should keep trying his mother.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.304
Yeah, good luck with that.

19:43.390 --> 19:45.976
-[Miguel grunts]
-[Johnny] What the hell's he doing?

19:46.977 --> 19:48.937
-All right. No, no, no.
-<i>Hyah.</i>

19:49.021 --> 19:50.564
You're doing it all wrong.

19:50.647 --> 19:51.523
[sighs]

19:51.607 --> 19:54.526
What do you want, those kids at school
to keep dumping shit on your head?

19:54.610 --> 19:56.945
You want all the girls
to think you're a wang-less dork?

19:57.029 --> 19:59.281
'Cause you can stop your training now,
walk outside

19:59.364 --> 20:01.241
and let the whole world know
you're a loser.

20:01.658 --> 20:04.828
Or you can plant your feet,
look your enemy in the eyes,

20:04.912 --> 20:06.246
and punch him in the face!

20:07.831 --> 20:08.790
Picture your enemy.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.172
You have a picture in your mind?

20:16.632 --> 20:17.674
What are you gonna do?

20:18.508 --> 20:19.635
<i>-Hyah!</i>
<i>-</i>Again!

20:19.718 --> 20:20.928
<i>-Hyah!</i>
-Are you a loser?

20:21.011 --> 20:22.012
No, Sensei! [grunts]

20:22.095 --> 20:23.013
Again!

20:23.096 --> 20:24.139
[grunting loudly]

20:24.223 --> 20:25.933
[grunting, shouting]

20:27.935 --> 20:30.145
[shouting escalates]

20:32.189 --> 20:34.983
The yanagi, or yanagiba,
depending on the region,

20:35.067 --> 20:38.779
is a knife used exclusively
for cutting sashimi.

20:39.821 --> 20:42.908
I picked up this bad boy
on my first trip to Okinawa.

20:43.492 --> 20:44.409
Voilà.

20:46.286 --> 20:47.329
The famous...

20:49.164 --> 20:50.874
LaRusso ponzu toro.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.294
Uh, no, thanks. I don't like sushi.

20:55.295 --> 20:56.338
[mom] Uh...

20:56.421 --> 20:58.465
Are you sure you just
don't wanna try a little piece?

20:58.548 --> 20:59.841
It melts in your mouth.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.052
No, fish kind of grosses me out.

21:03.136 --> 21:06.056
No, you like fish.
What about the fish sticks at school?

21:06.139 --> 21:07.641
Oh yeah, fish sticks are dope.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.184
You have fish sticks?

21:09.268 --> 21:13.605
Uh, no, just this fresh fish I picked up
from the Japanese market this morning.

21:13.689 --> 21:14.523
[mom] You know,

21:14.606 --> 21:16.942
why don't we see if we can find Kyler
something he can eat.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.735
Sam, you wanna come with me
to the kitchen?

21:18.819 --> 21:19.820
Sure.

21:24.241 --> 21:25.450
[exhales]

21:27.744 --> 21:30.789
Thank you for inviting me over,
Mr. LaRusso.

21:30.872 --> 21:33.083
Um, you have a really great house.

21:34.084 --> 21:35.836
And I think Sam is really cool too.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.338
Well, thanks. She takes after her mother.

21:39.047 --> 21:42.134
And listen, I never liked sushi
when I was your age either.

21:42.217 --> 21:45.095
It wasn't until I met a good friend
that it began to grow on me.

21:45.178 --> 21:46.179
Hmm.

21:46.263 --> 21:47.597
He was from Okinawa.

21:49.057 --> 21:50.475
Where are your parents from?

21:51.184 --> 21:52.019
Irvine...

21:52.477 --> 21:53.312
I think.

21:53.812 --> 21:54.771
Irvine. [chuckles]

21:55.355 --> 21:56.189
Right.

21:58.483 --> 22:00.610
So tell me about that shiner
you got there.

22:01.903 --> 22:02.863
Oh, this.

22:02.946 --> 22:03.822
Um...

22:04.364 --> 22:05.615
This is from wrestling.

22:05.699 --> 22:09.119
You know, I dodged the wrong way,
and I caught an elbow.

22:09.911 --> 22:11.455
It's stupid.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.832
Is that how you hurt your hand too?

22:15.334 --> 22:18.462
It's OK. I was in my share of fights
back in high school.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.088
I don't know what you're talking about.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.632
Come on, Kyler.
I know high school kids can be rough.

22:22.716 --> 22:24.384
No, it wasn't a kid.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.346
So there was a fight.

22:28.972 --> 22:29.890
[grunts]

22:29.973 --> 22:32.601
Is… is there something going on at home?

22:32.684 --> 22:34.269
Oh no. No. Um…

22:37.356 --> 22:38.273
OK, just...

22:39.107 --> 22:42.152
Some guy at a mini-mall,
he just jumped me and my friends.

22:42.235 --> 22:43.070
What?

22:43.528 --> 22:46.114
Yeah. We were just
at the store trying to get…

22:46.656 --> 22:48.283
some protein bars.

22:48.367 --> 22:53.455
And, yeah… some homeless-looking guy,
he just started giving us a hard time.

22:53.538 --> 22:55.874
And the next thing we know,
he busts some karate.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.250
Karate?

22:57.334 --> 22:59.503
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

23:00.003 --> 23:01.213
What mini-mall was this?

23:10.680 --> 23:13.809
Hey, Sensei, is there any particular way
you want me to wash these windows?

23:13.892 --> 23:15.435
No, I don't give a shit.

23:15.977 --> 23:17.062
Whatever's easiest.

23:19.106 --> 23:20.232
You know what?

23:20.315 --> 23:22.567
Just go clean the toilet,
and we'll call it a night.

23:24.861 --> 23:25.904
[Miguel] OK.

23:26.780 --> 23:28.782
And do that one on your hands and knees.

23:29.825 --> 23:30.867

Welcome to Cobra Kai.

23:54.391 --> 23:55.684
Some things never change.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.563
Yeah, what are you talking about?

24:00.814 --> 24:03.775
I heard you beat up a bunch of teenagers
in that parking lot.

24:03.859 --> 24:04.985
Oh, that.

24:05.652 --> 24:06.486
No.

24:07.237 --> 24:08.822
I didn't beat up any teenagers.

24:11.241 --> 24:14.077
I kicked the shit out
of a bunch of assholes who deserved it.

24:14.161 --> 24:15.412
[Daniel scoffs]

24:15.495 --> 24:18.331
Wow. Johnny Lawrence
calling someone else an asshole.

24:18.415 --> 24:19.499
That's rich, man.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.042
What's that supposed to mean?

24:21.668 --> 24:22.586
Uh, look...

24:23.044 --> 24:24.713
I'm not here to rehash the past.

24:26.423 --> 24:28.300
Just stay away from my daughter's friends.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.177
Your daughter's friends?

24:31.052 --> 24:32.471
Yeah, that makes sense.

24:32.554 --> 24:35.223
-Nice company she keeps.
-What the hell is that supposed to mean?

24:35.307 --> 24:38.268
It means those friends of hers
were wailing on a kid half their size.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.563
Maybe you don't know your daughter
as well as you think you do.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.817
-Get your house in order, LaRusso.
-Who the hell you think you're talking to?

24:46.359 --> 24:47.903
[Miguel] Bathroom's clean!

24:47.986 --> 24:50.071
Is there anything else you need me to do?

24:50.989 --> 24:53.575
Oh! I'm sorry, Sensei. I...

24:54.367 --> 24:55.285
"Sensei"?

24:56.119 --> 24:56.953
Really?

24:57.704 --> 24:59.539
Oh my God, kid.
I don't know what he's told you,

24:59.623 --> 25:02.751
but you shouldn't believe a word he says,
or you're gonna end up exactly like him.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.045
You and I...

25:05.378 --> 25:06.254
This...

25:07.047 --> 25:08.048
We aren't done.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.177
I'm right here, man.

25:12.594 --> 25:13.762
[Daniel scoffs loudly]

25:16.932 --> 25:17.933
[sighs]

25:25.106 --> 25:27.192
[Miguel] I'm sorry
if I interrupted anything,  Sensei.

-[shop bell jangles]
-Should I do 20 push-ups on my knuckles?

25:29.694 --> 25:31.196
