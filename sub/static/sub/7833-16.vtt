Wait a minute.
I died on the operating table, didn't I?

12:17.432 --> 12:20.957
Yeah, but just for a minute. It's a funny story.
I'll tell you sometime.

12:21.064 --> 12:24.724
- So this is all real?
- Oh, you dear, dear man.

12:24.830 --> 12:27.296
You're one of us
beautiful people now.

12:27.406 --> 12:29.782
And your new life begins today.

12:29.884 --> 12:34.670
A new life.
A second chance... for revenge.

12:34.772 --> 12:37.937
That brown patch
needs a little H2O.

Hey, Duff Man, let's see how you like
a sticker on your face! Yeah!

Yeah, hello yourself.
I'm Moe Szyslak.

12:57.265 --> 12:59.270
Back in high school, I asked you...

12:59.379 --> 13:02.442
to the Springtime Pumpkin Dance
and you turned me down.

13:02.551 --> 13:06.706
Well, I just wanted to show you the face
that you could have been kissing.

13:06.811 --> 13:09.942
<i>- Yeah.
- Oh, I was just a stupid kid back then.</i>

13:10.048 --> 13:11.996
And I feel terrible
about hurting you.

13:12.096 --> 13:15.689
- Will you accept my apology?
- Apology?

13:15.796 --> 13:18.239
Uh, geez.
I wasn't expecting that. Uh-

13:18.339 --> 13:20.714
Run!

13:20.815 --> 13:22.662
Man, that felt great!

13:24.482 --> 13:27.579
Okay, last stop, Channel 6.

13:27.686 --> 13:30.783
You gonna get even with that lottery guy
that never picks our numbers?

13:30.890 --> 13:33.299
Nah, nah, nah.
This is personal.

13:34.722 --> 13:37.165
<i>It all goes back to my acting days.</i>

13:37.265 --> 13:39.236
<i>I was auditioning for the role

- What were you thinking?
- Well, you said you wanted ''gritty.''

13:49.057 --> 13:50.937
In other words, ugly.

13:51.038 --> 13:52.953
<i>I wanted Mary Ann

13:55.630 --> 13:59.616
TV ugly, not ugly-ugly.

14:02.962 --> 14:06.655
I've been called ugly,
pug ugly, fugly, pug fugly...

14:06.760 --> 14:08.641
but never ugly-ugly.

14:08.742 --> 14:11.771
Well, it's time to get some closure.

14:11.880 --> 14:14.819
Extreme closure.

14:16.372 --> 14:19.795
But I've been Dr. Tad
Winslow for 25 years.

14:19.906 --> 14:22.114
It's time I got a raise!

14:22.219 --> 14:23.897
Oh, shut up, you windy old hack.

14:24.002 --> 14:26.277
And another thing, you have
to stop calling me that.

14:26.380 --> 14:28.588
Remember me?
Twenty-five years ago...

14:28.693 --> 14:31.958
you said I was too ugly
to play Dr. Tad Winslow.

14:32.061 --> 14:34.933
I did? Well, that's why
pencils have erasers, hon.

14:35.034 --> 14:38.457
- You're our new Dr. Tad Winslow.
- Really? You mean it?

14:38.568 --> 14:41.270
But there can't be
two Dr. Tad Winslows!

14:41.376 --> 14:43.584
That's going to- Oh.

[ Moans ]

And as Dr. Tad Winslow,

15:16.682 --> 15:19.516
I don't know if I'll be able to accept
Moe as Dr. Tad Winslow.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.299
Well, I'm gonna keep watching...

So, Lenny, how are things working out
with you and that girl next door?

I'm a little busy, Homer.
You can pour it yourself.

Hmm. This isn't nearly
as complicated as Moe made it seem.

''You don't love me. The only thing you love
is your ear, nose and throat pavilion.''

16:29.133 --> 16:32.328
I've dedicated my life to diseases

But the one hole I've never been able
to fix is the one in my soul!

16:36.589 --> 16:40.211
That was amazing, Moe.
I'm actually a little turned on.

16:40.318 --> 16:44.176
Hey, I got a gift. As a child,
I was bitten by the acting bug.

16:44.277 --> 16:47.573
Then it burrowed under my skin
and laid eggs in my heart.

16:47.675 --> 16:51.364
Now those eggs are hatching,
and the feeling is indescribable.

<i>Then I get in a skydiving accident and have
