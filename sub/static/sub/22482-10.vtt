00:01.302 --> 00:04.072
Previously on Mom...
I was thinking I could stay

00:04.105 --> 00:07.075
an extra night for the express
purpose of taking you out.

00:07.108 --> 00:08.576
I'd really like that.
Oh, great.

00:08.609 --> 00:11.245
Are you kidding me? You can't
go out with Adam's brother.

00:11.279 --> 00:14.248
And yet I've got my good bra on
and I'm headed out the door.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.350
Yeah, but I actually
have to get back home tomorrow.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.152
I'm gonna miss you.

00:18.186 --> 00:21.422
You think we should try
the long

00:21.455 --> 00:23.324
I'm game.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.661
But while I've got you here...

00:32.300 --> 00:33.634
You ready for
your coffee, babe?

00:33.667 --> 00:35.069
No, thanks.

00:35.103 --> 00:36.770
Starting today,
I am giving it up.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.372
Seriously?

00:38.406 --> 00:40.774
Coffee is your only
source of water.

00:40.808 --> 00:43.244
When did water
become such a big thing?

00:43.277 --> 00:46.314
Isn't it enough
that I bathe in it?

00:46.347 --> 00:48.349
Where did all this come from?

00:48.382 --> 00:49.450
I read it on Facebook.

00:49.483 --> 00:51.652
"Five Things You Should Give Up
for a Happier Life."

00:51.685 --> 00:53.487
Was number one Facebook?

00:55.189 --> 00:58.292
Hey, how come you guys
didn't wake me up for school?

00:58.326 --> 00:59.493
'Cause you're not seven.

00:59.527 --> 01:03.331
I wish I was.
I liked living alone.

01:03.364 --> 01:04.832
You want a bagel?

01:04.865 --> 01:07.201
Thanks, but all I need
is coffee.

01:07.235 --> 01:10.238
How sad to be so dependent.
I remember those days.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.707
She gave up coffee
30 seconds ago.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.243
Good for you.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.111
You're a dead man.

01:17.145 --> 01:19.380
:
She's just kidding.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.115
Help me.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.884
Oh, damn.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.287
I just missed another
phone call from Patrick.

01:26.320 --> 01:29.223
How does this happen? I was
holding my phone in my hand.

01:29.257 --> 01:31.325
Why do you hate love?

01:31.359 --> 01:33.194
Why don't you stop
playing phone tag

01:33.227 --> 01:35.263
and just drive down
to Santa Cruz to see him?

01:35.296 --> 01:38.732
When? We have
totally opposite schedules.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.668
Relationships are torture.

01:40.701 --> 01:43.304
Like waterboarding with sex.

01:43.337 --> 01:46.374
That's the sort of comment
that used to bother me

01:46.407 --> 01:48.776
when I was under the thumb
of the brown god.

01:51.712 --> 01:55.616
This long-distance thing
is just so frustrating.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.253
I'm not sure Patrick and I
can make it work.

01:59.287 --> 02:02.490
For what it's worth,
I hope you guys figure it out.

02:03.724 --> 02:07.195
Oh, my God,
I just missed his call again!

02:07.228 --> 02:08.829
How, how, how?!

02:10.398 --> 02:12.666
I'll see ya later.

02:12.700 --> 02:15.236
Boy, I do not miss dating,
you know what I mean?

02:15.269 --> 02:17.171
Take a sip of your coffee
and kiss me.

02:22.576 --> 02:26.180
Hey, Patrick, sorry I missed
your call, yet again.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.448
I dropped my phone
in the fountain

02:27.481 --> 02:28.782
in front of the library.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.418
I was making a wish.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.453
Actually, I was wishing
you would call me.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.887
Ironic, right?

02:33.921 --> 02:35.489
Is it ironic?

02:35.523 --> 02:37.358
That's a word I should
probably stay away from

02:37.391 --> 02:39.860
until I figure out
what it really means.

02:39.893 --> 02:43.364
Anyway, my phone
still works, so...

02:43.397 --> 02:46.534
hit me back, as the kids say.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.269
Yikes.

02:48.302 --> 02:51.372
Oh, by the way, this is Christy.

02:51.405 --> 02:53.741
Who should've stopped
at "Sorry I missed your call."

02:53.774 --> 02:56.810
Excuse me.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.547
Don't I know you from
that time we slept together?

02:59.580 --> 03:01.349
Hi, Cooper.

03:01.382 --> 03:03.351
Sorry, I've been meaning
to catch up with you.

03:03.384 --> 03:05.553
Oh, now's your chance.
You mind if I sit?

03:05.586 --> 03:08.589
Kind of a bad time;
I-I really got to study.

03:08.622 --> 03:12.293
Got it. I won't say a word.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.765
Mm.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.534
Mm.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.441
:
"Bonjour.

03:29.377 --> 03:32.946
You are the hottest girl
in the student center."

03:32.980 --> 03:35.749
Cooper, seriously?

03:35.783 --> 03:38.486
: It's not me.
He has a mind of his own.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.521
: "And I cannot
get you off of it."

03:40.554 --> 03:42.356
Very funny.

03:42.390 --> 03:45.493
"I am not trying to be funny,
I am trying to be sexy.

03:45.526 --> 03:46.694
:
Hon, hon, hon."

03:46.727 --> 03:48.529
By being lame?

03:48.562 --> 03:49.963
"Oh, that depends.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.433
Is it working,
mon petit ketchup packet?"

03:56.570 --> 03:59.407
"That was fantastique."

03:59.440 --> 04:02.410
It worked; knock it off.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.445
*

04:30.871 --> 04:32.506
Hey.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.875
Oh, geez, you scared me!

04:34.908 --> 04:36.944
I thought you gave up coffee.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.480
My head is pounding,
my colon's in gridlock,

04:39.513 --> 04:43.884
and I winged a butter plate at
Adam, so I'm back on the bean.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.519
Yeah, yeah, good for you.

04:45.553 --> 04:46.954
I had sex with Cooper.

04:46.987 --> 04:49.757
I'm sorry, what?

04:49.790 --> 04:51.792
I know. I feel so guilty.

04:51.825 --> 04:52.860
Why?

04:52.893 --> 04:54.628
Because I'm seeing someone.

04:54.662 --> 04:57.665
Patrick? Oh, come on,
you haven't even slept with him.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.333
Believe me, I want to,

04:59.367 --> 05:02.403
but our genitals are never
in the same ZIP Code.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.605
And that's not gonna change
anytime soon,

05:04.638 --> 05:06.440
so you're free to do
whatever you want.

05:06.474 --> 05:09.610
It's like prison.
Nobody's married, nobody's gay.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.582
Whoa, Mom.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.083
You actually made me
feel better.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.485
Thank you.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.387
You act like it's the first--

05:19.420 --> 05:20.721
You're welcome.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.792
Ugh, please
don't tell Adam.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.428
Why would I tell him
you're cheating on his brother?

05:27.461 --> 05:30.063
He would see it that way.
I don't. Keep hugging.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.669
:
Ah...

05:37.170 --> 05:40.608
You never know how much you love
something until you give it up.

05:40.641 --> 05:44.412
You realize you're talking
to a table full of addicts?

05:44.445 --> 05:46.647
I don't see the connection.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.683
So, Christy,
I'm confused.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.819
At your age,
it's only gonna get worse.

05:51.852 --> 05:55.489
Are you and Cooper dating again?

05:55.523 --> 05:58.826
No. It was just
a one-time thing.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.662
Well, a two-time thing.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.831
I swung by on the way over here.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.733
Oh, look at you having it all.

06:05.766 --> 06:08.702
If you get a bladder infection,
I'm gonna be so proud.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.705
So you like this boy.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.874
No, I like Patrick.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.743
I'm just having fun with Cooper.

06:15.776 --> 06:19.012
Be careful, with your bladder
and your heart.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.685
I'm fine.

06:24.718 --> 06:27.087
Guys do this stuff all the time.
Why can't I?

06:27.120 --> 06:30.858
Because you can't be intimate
without getting attached.

06:30.891 --> 06:31.925
Just 'cause I'm sober?

06:31.959 --> 06:33.994
No, because you're you.

06:34.027 --> 06:35.996
I can do it, Bonnie can do it...

06:36.029 --> 06:39.567
Can do it blindfolded, and have.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.569
I'm doing it right now.

06:41.602 --> 06:44.872
He's an anesthesiologist.
I feel nothing.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.774
I'm sure
he doesn't either.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.916
Where you headed?
Cooper's.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.017
Dressed like that?

06:57.050 --> 06:59.119
That's the beauty
of this thing.

06:59.152 --> 07:02.823
It requires
virtually no effort.

07:02.856 --> 07:04.191
I text two words:
"You up?"

07:04.224 --> 07:06.727
And bam, it's on.

07:06.760 --> 07:10.764
One time it auto-corrected to
"Soup?" but it still happened.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.167
Hey, where you off to?

07:14.201 --> 07:17.805
Uh... to the store.

07:17.838 --> 07:20.674
Not the close one, the one
across town with the olive bar.

07:20.708 --> 07:21.975
God, I love olives.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.212
Anyway, I might be a while.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.481
Would you mind
picking up some coffee?

07:27.515 --> 07:29.717
Your mom's blowing through
a bag a day.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.820
Sure.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.121
BONNIE:
Well, as long as

07:34.154 --> 07:36.990
you're going... to the store...

07:38.158 --> 07:40.561
...could you pick up some soup?

07:42.262 --> 07:46.534
Everybody loves
a nice, hot, sexy bowl of soup.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.703
Yeah, soup would be great.

07:49.737 --> 07:52.906
Got it.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.975
Coffee and soup.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.677
She's the best.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.912
My brother does
not deserve her.

07:58.946 --> 07:59.880
Aw, that's sweet.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.582
You should've told her that
before she left.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.924
Oh, my God, it gets better
every time.

08:10.958 --> 08:13.293
Sure does.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.862
I got to go.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.163
Wait. Wait.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.799
Why are you always in
such a hurry to leave?

08:18.832 --> 08:21.935
Well, I'm busy, you're busy.

08:21.969 --> 08:23.537
Busy, busy, busy.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.973
Yeah, but this is
working, right?

08:26.006 --> 08:27.975
Works for me.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.610
I'm free Tuesday at 5:00,

08:29.643 --> 08:31.912
as long as I'm back
in my car by 20 after.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.914
Christy, come on.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.717
This isn't just
hooking up anymore.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.619
It isn't?

08:38.652 --> 08:39.920
No.

08:39.953 --> 08:43.557
I am totally falling
in love with you.

08:54.334 --> 08:55.969
Yup.

08:56.003 --> 09:00.073
* Falling in
love with you. *

09:01.709 --> 09:04.344
But you're
a 24-year-old guy.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.947
24-year-old guys
don't fall in love.

09:06.980 --> 09:10.217
My mom says
I'm an old soul.

09:10.250 --> 09:13.754
Well, I am
a much older soul.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.289
And I have a lot of baggage.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.158
Lots and lots of baggage.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.661
Then let me help
you carry it.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.696
Holy cow.

09:25.633 --> 09:30.704
Cooper, look, I just don't have
the same feelings for you.

09:30.738 --> 09:33.941
Oh.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.676
Well, now I'm a
little embarrassed.

09:35.709 --> 09:38.311
I booped your nose
and everything.

09:38.345 --> 09:41.148
I thought we were just
gonna keep it casual,

09:41.181 --> 09:43.150
you know,
having a good time.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.653
You mean just sex?

09:45.686 --> 09:47.354
Exactly.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.757
I assumed we were
on the same page.

09:49.790 --> 09:53.193
Well, we were not.

09:57.998 --> 10:02.202
So, just to be clear,
Tuesday at 5:00 not happening?

10:07.240 --> 10:09.276
Bonnie, Bonnie,
wake up. Bonnie.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.111
It's sleepy time.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.946
I'll throw you one
in the morning.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.148
Bonnie. Bonnie.

10:15.182 --> 10:18.051
Okay, fine, but it's not
gonna be the Fourth of July.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.820
I don't want to have sex.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.122
Why not?
What's wrong with me?

10:22.155 --> 10:24.758
I'm worried about Christy; she
never came home from the store.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.059
Oh.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.127
Yeah.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.130
Well, she takes forever.

10:30.163 --> 10:33.801
She walks down every aisle,
she talks to people,

10:33.834 --> 10:35.836
then she has to find
someone tall

10:35.869 --> 10:37.805
to get stuff off the top shelf.
It's a circus.

10:37.838 --> 10:41.074
Why am I more worried
about your kid than you are?

10:41.108 --> 10:45.078
God, now you sound like
the lady from Child Services.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.848
What if she got in an accident?
I think you're overreacting.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.817
I think you're underreacting.
I'm gonna call the police.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.251
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:51.284 --> 10:54.387
Plunkett family rule number one:
no cops, ever.

10:54.421 --> 10:56.356
What is wrong with you?

10:56.389 --> 10:58.792
You know what? You're right.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.994
I'm gonna text her.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.863
Oh.
She actually texted me.

11:05.132 --> 11:08.235
Uh, "Ran into Wendy.
She's having a crisis.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.403
What else is new?
Be home late."

11:10.437 --> 11:13.440
Huh. Well, that made me horny.
How 'bout you?

11:19.813 --> 11:23.183
Oh, hey, you're still up.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.285
Yeah. How's Wendy?

11:25.318 --> 11:26.820
Wendy?

11:26.854 --> 11:28.856
Yeah, your mom said
she was having a crisis.

11:28.889 --> 11:32.092
Oh, yes. Wendy's crisis.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.762
So bad.

11:34.795 --> 11:38.198
We ate your soup
and drank your coffee.

11:41.201 --> 11:44.171
Sorry to hear that.
What's wrong?

11:44.204 --> 11:46.439
Ugh, I can't really
talk about it.

11:46.473 --> 11:48.842
It's an A.A. thing.
It's a lady thing.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.744
It's an A.A. lady thing.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.212
Got it.

11:52.245 --> 11:54.214
Well, glad you
made it home safe.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.816
I was a little worried.

11:55.849 --> 11:58.351
Oh.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.953
Thanks.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.354
Night.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.823
Night.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.860
:
Oh, damn it.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.466
Adam, I lied.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.136
I wasn't with Wendy.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.805
I was with a guy.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.940
A guy?

12:19.973 --> 12:22.375
A guy who isn't your brother.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.779
Oh.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.950
Yeah, I've been seeing Patrick,

12:29.983 --> 12:32.953
but I've also been
doing this other thing, and...

12:36.289 --> 12:38.291
...I guess
I'm kind of embarrassed.

12:38.325 --> 12:41.895
Okay.

12:41.929 --> 12:46.834
Well, um, not proud of it,
but...

12:46.867 --> 12:50.003
there's a part of me that's...

12:50.037 --> 12:52.439
kind of laughing at my brother
right now.

12:53.874 --> 12:57.244
Tempted to call him up
and rub his nose in it.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.846
You can't.

12:58.879 --> 12:59.880
I won't. I-I won't.

12:59.913 --> 13:02.249
Good, 'cause I really like him.

13:05.385 --> 13:07.054
I made a mess, didn't I?

13:07.087 --> 13:09.890
Like a dog after he ate
a can of chili.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.892
My dog did that once.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.927
We had to burn
the carpet...

13:18.065 --> 13:20.400
I hope you don't think
less of me.

13:22.435 --> 13:25.906
Christy, your life is your life,
but I got to tell you,

13:25.939 --> 13:28.075
all this lying and
sneaking around,

13:28.108 --> 13:29.576
it doesn't
sound like you.

13:29.609 --> 13:31.111
Sounds more
like your mom.

13:31.144 --> 13:35.115
Oh, my God, that's the
worst thing you could say.

13:35.148 --> 13:38.251
I'm sorry. I just mean
you're better than she is.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.089
She knows. I told her.

13:42.122 --> 13:45.458
So...

13:45.492 --> 13:48.528
who is this guy
who's not my brother?

13:48.561 --> 13:52.265
Just someone
from school.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.902
It was supposed
to be casual.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.904
My attempt
at being a dude.

13:56.937 --> 14:00.040
But then he went and screwed it
up by having feelings for me.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.542
Hold on. Did you set
up the ground rules?

14:02.575 --> 14:05.112
No, I just assumed
we were on the same page.

14:05.145 --> 14:06.880
Ooh, rookie mistake.

14:06.914 --> 14:09.316
Listen, if you're
gonna act like a dude,

14:09.349 --> 14:11.151
you got to set
up the rules.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.187
You got to say things like "I'm
not looking for a relationship,

14:14.221 --> 14:15.989
"I'm not built for
a relationship,

14:16.023 --> 14:19.226
I'm not a relationship kind of
guy," that type of nonsense.

14:19.259 --> 14:22.329
Oh, you're right.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.531
Guys do say that.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.900
Guess I never really heard it
because at that point

14:26.934 --> 14:28.468
I'm always thinking,
"I can change you,

14:28.501 --> 14:30.337
I can change you,
I can change you."

14:30.370 --> 14:34.207
When will women learn
they can't change men?

14:34.241 --> 14:38.411
Says the man who put a ring
on my mom's finger

14:38.445 --> 14:40.280
and now listens to Adele.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.084
Son of a bitch.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.522
Okay, how does
this sound?

14:49.556 --> 14:51.024
"Dear Cooper..."

14:51.058 --> 14:52.192
BONNIE:
Bad.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.561
It's a text,
not a letter from camp.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.330
Don't send anything.

14:57.364 --> 14:59.632
But I need him to forgive me.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.435
How many times have
you apologized?

15:02.469 --> 15:03.937
Four...

15:03.971 --> 15:06.406
teen.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.308
Did you try an
Edible Arrangement?

15:08.341 --> 15:12.212
She's apologizing for
an "edible arrangement."

15:14.081 --> 15:17.584
I am wasted
on all of you.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.519
It's horrible.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.521
I can't eat, can't sleep.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.590
This is what I was
worried about.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.058
You developed feelings.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.593
WENDY:
Oh, I get it.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.996
"Edible."

15:29.029 --> 15:32.165
Cooper developed
the stupid feelings.

15:32.199 --> 15:33.666
I was the dude.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.502
If you were really the dude,
you wouldn't care.

15:35.535 --> 15:37.137
You would ride off
on your motorcycle

15:37.170 --> 15:38.705
and go shoot pool,
maybe a bear.

15:38.738 --> 15:42.209
I'm not even listening
to her anymore.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.311
Honey, you're just gonna
have to live with the fact

15:44.344 --> 15:46.613
that there's somebody out there
who doesn't like you.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.082
"Doesn't like you"?
He hates her guts.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.617
And FYI, he's not alone.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.619
MARJORIE:
I'm just saying

15:52.652 --> 15:55.322
that it's not fair for you
to continue hurting him

15:55.355 --> 15:57.057
just to make yourself
feel better.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.060
She's so wise.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.429
And yet she thought
a purple velour tracksuit

16:02.462 --> 16:04.064
was a good idea.

16:04.097 --> 16:06.133
Fine.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.767
I'll leave Cooper alone.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.036
Good.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.471
Now, who else hates me?

16:11.504 --> 16:13.306
Greg at
the Thursday night meeting.

16:13.340 --> 16:15.775
Who's Greg?

16:15.808 --> 16:17.477
The guy you always call Scott.

16:17.510 --> 16:21.114
Oh, my God, Scott hates me?

16:44.604 --> 16:46.173
Hi.

16:46.206 --> 16:48.541
Oh, God, when do you graduate?

16:50.610 --> 16:54.214
Look, I know I already said
I was sorry,

16:54.247 --> 16:58.218
but I just need you to know
that I'm really, really sorry.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.553
I just don't get it, Christy.

17:00.587 --> 17:03.390
I mean, it would be one thing
if there was another guy.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.225
Ooh, there is!

17:05.258 --> 17:07.060
There's totally another guy.

17:08.128 --> 17:08.961
Does that help?

17:08.995 --> 17:11.598
Not as much as I hoped.

17:11.631 --> 17:15.568
What I mean is if I was
able to actually see him,

17:15.602 --> 17:18.605
I wouldn't have needed you.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.440
Oops, that came out
a little harsh.

17:20.473 --> 17:23.176
Everything you say
comes out a little harsh.

17:23.210 --> 17:26.579
I just mean that
it's a long-distance thing,

17:26.613 --> 17:28.848
and I was frustrated
because it was so complicated

17:28.881 --> 17:30.383
and you were so easy.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.552
Your apology is making me
want to kill myself.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.755
That's not what I want.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.757
Okay, then what do you want?

17:39.592 --> 17:42.129
I guess I want to be
with the other guy.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.296
Then go.

17:46.133 --> 17:49.202
: "Okay. Well,
perhaps you will take comfort

17:49.236 --> 17:52.105
"in the fact that I will die
long before you.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.275
Au revoir."

18:09.756 --> 18:11.424
Marjorie said moderation is key,

18:11.458 --> 18:15.162
so I'm just gonna have
one cup of coffee a day.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.563
I can live with that.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.200
You must have been a fun drunk.

18:20.233 --> 18:24.171
I had a small but fervent
cult following.

18:29.276 --> 18:32.345
Wow. Christy's driving down
to Santa Cruz to see Patrick.

18:32.379 --> 18:35.415
She said she's either gonna make
it work or get her heart broken.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.650
I can't believe she's that
crazy about my brother.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.586
He's kind of a tool.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.554
We are so lucky
to have each other.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.523
Yeah, we are.
And, hey, you don't ever

18:43.556 --> 18:45.525
have to worry about
me cheating on you.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.794
I wasn't, but go on.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.562
I mean, juggling girlfriends,

18:49.596 --> 18:52.365
trying to remember which lie
you told who, sneaking around.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.534
Being with you is
so much less trouble.

18:54.567 --> 18:57.304
Look at you,
writing your vows already.

18:57.337 --> 18:58.938
No, no, you know
what I meant.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.241
I do. And you know
if you ever did cheat on me,

19:01.274 --> 19:02.609
I would take the wheels
off your chair

19:02.642 --> 19:03.643
and leave you in the woods.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.278
I do.

19:08.915 --> 19:10.917
It's just kind of wonderful
that Christy's racing

19:10.950 --> 19:15.588
down the highway, wind in her
hair, all in the name of love.

19:15.622 --> 19:18.325
* I'm so excited

19:18.358 --> 19:21.194
* And I just can't hide it

19:22.195 --> 19:24.497
* I know, I know, I know,
I know, I know *

19:24.531 --> 19:27.700
* I want you, I want you.
