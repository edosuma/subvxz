WEBVTT

00:00.417 --> 00:01.793
Now, Robot, kick 'em
in the knees.

00:01.960 --> 00:03.212
Bears have weak knees.

00:03.378 --> 00:06.048
And you should vibrate, 'cause
the robot's full of radiation.

00:06.215 --> 00:06.632
Yeah, that's it.

00:06.798 --> 00:07.549
Frank.

00:07.716 --> 00:09.510
How many bears did I say
you could have?

00:09.676 --> 00:10.219
One.

00:10.385 --> 00:13.388
And how many do you see here?

00:13.555 --> 00:15.224
Um, four?

00:15.398 --> 00:17.103
Save a little money
for the rest of us, Frank.

00:17.263 --> 00:19.061
You can't spend a bunch
of money on bear suits

00:19.227 --> 00:22.233
that are only gonna be seen
for, like, 25 seconds.

00:22.399 --> 00:24.232
Liz, nobody's gonna believe
that a killer robot

00:24.398 --> 00:25.983
can get his ass kicked
by one bear.

00:26.158 --> 00:27.022
It doesn't make any sense.

00:27.197 --> 00:30.193
You're trying to bring logic
to the robot-bear sketch?

00:30.367 --> 00:32.320
You can't have four bears.

00:32.496 --> 00:33.902
Well, how many can I keep?

00:34.077 --> 00:36.321
One!

00:37.248 --> 00:39.493
Sorry, guys.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.123
Uh, who did my Sudoku puzzle?

00:41.296 --> 00:44.462
I have been looking forward
to this puzzle all morning.

00:44.627 --> 00:45.712
Hey, Liz, could you
come up to my office

00:45.877 --> 00:46.711
when you have a free moment?

00:46.887 --> 00:48.093
I never have a free moment,
Jack.

00:48.256 --> 00:50.961
Never, ever.

00:51.515 --> 00:54.841
Really punch him.
Like karate.

00:55.017 --> 00:58.301
Are you familiar with
the Japanese art of Reiki?

00:58.477 --> 00:59.931
No.

01:00.106 --> 01:04.019
It is the laying-on of hands
in order to improve one's life.

01:04.187 --> 01:05.141
Hm, how does your life improve?

01:05.327 --> 01:07.652
Do the hands
have money in them?

01:07.817 --> 01:09.573
Human contact
is important, Lemon.

01:09.738 --> 01:10.902
I can tell
from your stress level

01:11.075 --> 01:13.360
that you have not been touched
in any way in quite some time.

01:13.537 --> 01:15.321
Not caress??
Not massaged.

01:15.496 --> 01:16.700
Not even groped
on the subway.

01:16.865 --> 01:18.162
Where are you headed
with this?

01:18.328 --> 01:20.031
Your mood affects
the quality of your work,

01:20.207 --> 01:21.121
which, in turn,
affects me.

01:21.297 --> 01:23.203
I would like to become
a resource to you

01:23.375 --> 01:25.332
for improving
your personal life.

01:25.508 --> 01:27.751
Do you agree that you need
someone in your life, Lemon?

01:27.928 --> 01:30.963
No, I have bigger things
to worry about than my personal life.

01:31.137 --> 01:32.803
I would think that a single
woman's biggest worry

01:32.968 --> 01:35.883
would be choking to death
alone in her apartment.

01:36.057 --> 01:38.300
I have a friend in town
I'd like to set you up with.

01:38.477 --> 01:39.600
No, thank you.

01:39.765 --> 01:41.762
Thomas is very bright,
has a wonderful sense of humor.

01:41.937 --> 01:42.510
I think it's a good match.

01:42.685 --> 01:43.561
Are you free on Thursday?

01:43.728 --> 01:45.481
No, Thursday is poker night.

01:45.648 --> 01:48.481
And by the way,
it is completely inappropriate

01:48.655 --> 01:50.771
for you to be questioning me
about my private life,

01:50.948 --> 01:52.440
and then trying to set me up
with someone

01:52.616 --> 01:56.151
when you don't even know
anything about me.

01:56.325 --> 01:57.862
Poker night?
Who plays?

01:58.035 --> 01:58.451
Really?

01:58.616 --> 02:00.243
That's all you got out of that?

02:00.417 --> 02:01.492
I enjoy poker,
and I'd be interested

02:01.665 --> 02:04.453
in seeing my new employees
under that kind of pressure.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.710
You're not gonna come to our
crappy poker game, are you?

02:06.875 --> 02:07.710
No, I'm not.

02:07.877 --> 02:08.330
Good.

02:08.507 --> 02:12.171
I bluffed.
Yes, I am coming.

02:14.008 --> 02:16.720
Three can't go here.
Three can't go here.

02:16.886 --> 02:19.800
It can go here.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:48.297 --> 02:51.960
Fine, I'll meet your friend.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.771
So who is this
Thomas guy?

03:15.947 --> 03:18.283
Oh, I don't know.
He's one of Jack's friends.

03:18.445 --> 03:21.031
Oh, my God, isn't Jack
friends with Tom DeLay?

03:21.206 --> 03:23.913
Am I going on a date
with Tom DeLay?

03:24.075 --> 03:26.581
Ugh, why did I say
I would do this?

03:26.745 --> 03:28.793
I haven't been on a date
since Dennis and I broke up,

03:28.955 --> 03:30.753
and that was almost
a year ago.

03:30.918 --> 03:32.250
It's gonna be a complete disaster.

03:32.427 --> 03:33.832
It's just one date.

03:34.005 --> 03:36.673
But if it is Tom DeLay
and you do go home with him,

03:36.846 --> 03:39.632
be  prepared for it
to get weird.

03:39.808 --> 03:42.011
Josh, you and me.
Thursday night.

03:42.187 --> 03:44.511
I know this guy that runs
an underground bird fight.

03:44.685 --> 03:47.601
Oh, yeah.
I can't do that.

03:47.766 --> 03:49.100
Thursday's poker night here.

03:49.276 --> 03:52.351
Guys, we just need to try
the green screen stuff one more time.

03:52.525 --> 03:54.983
Poker night?
I love poker.

03:55.158 --> 03:57.692
I used to play all kinds
of poker with my aunt.

03:57.868 --> 04:00.991
Crazy Seven.
Albuquerque Freakout.

04:01.155 --> 04:02.613
One Card Stud.

04:02.785 --> 04:05.073
Yeah, I don't think
those are real games.

04:05.247 --> 04:06.162
Whatever.

04:06.337 --> 04:09.663
Get ready to get took.

04:10.205 --> 04:13.922
No, Mom, I can't make it Friday.
I gotta work.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.081
Hey, Frank?

04:15.256 --> 04:16.130
Hold on.
Yeah.

04:16.297 --> 04:17.711
What do guys like?

04:17.887 --> 04:19.302
Uh, porn.

04:19.466 --> 04:22.593
No, I mean, if you were gonna
go on a date with a woman,

04:22.768 --> 04:24.263
how would you want her
to act?

04:24.438 --> 04:27.803
Like she was in a porn.

04:30.478 --> 04:32.022
Hey, Lemon.

04:32.185 --> 04:35.520
You're on for 8:00
for dinner at CafÃ© des Artistes.

04:35.696 --> 04:38.773
Really?
Wow. What?

04:40.368 --> 04:41.401
What are you
gonna wear?

04:41.575 --> 04:43.573
This, probably.
I don't have time to go home.

04:43.747 --> 04:46.032
No, that won't do.

04:46.206 --> 04:48.241
I want you to go out
on your lunch hour,

04:48.417 --> 04:51.042
and find something.

04:51.206 --> 04:54.873
At a women's clothing store.

04:58.345 --> 04:59.131
Remind me what's better.

04:59.298 --> 05:03.760
A pair of black Aces
or a pair of red Aces?

05:03.925 --> 05:07.261
You guys,
I'm leaving.

05:07.648 --> 05:08.931
All right.
All right.

05:09.107 --> 05:10.312
Check out the valley.
Look at that.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.521
Hey, look at you!

05:12.687 --> 05:16.651
You look like
a fancy prostitute.

05:18.068 --> 05:20.520
Okay, I got my chair.
I got my beer.

05:20.696 --> 05:22.191
I got my lucky donut.

05:22.368 --> 05:23.190
Oh, is there room
for one more?

05:23.368 --> 05:24.901
Yeah, sure.
Really?

05:25.076 --> 05:26.201
That's fantastic.

05:26.368 --> 05:29.990
Could we just, uh--
Yes, yes, yes.

05:30.166 --> 05:31.542
Donaghy, what up?

05:31.705 --> 05:32.541
What up, Tray?

05:32.708 --> 05:35.292
This round, Texas Doozy.
Face cards are wild.

05:35.466 --> 05:37.672
Threes are jinx.
Fives are twos.

05:37.835 --> 05:38.963
Tray, do you mind if I deal
this hand?

05:39.136 --> 05:40.791
Be  my guest.
Show me love.

05:40.965 --> 05:43.300
Ladies and gentlemen, the
minimum bet in this game is $25.

05:43.465 --> 05:45.263
Oh, Jack, we usually just play
for quarters.

05:45.427 --> 05:47.973
Well, then you best go home and
put on your daddy's shoes, boy.

05:48.148 --> 05:51.811
'Cause  this is a man's game.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.512
I call.

06:31.606 --> 06:35.813
And I'll see that with...
This thing.

06:42.447 --> 06:43.653
I call.

06:43.827 --> 06:44.533
Pair of Jacks.

06:44.695 --> 06:46.033
Ace high.

06:46.196 --> 06:48.741
Three cowboys.

06:48.907 --> 06:51.161
Oh, my God.
My wedding ring.

06:51.327 --> 06:54.543
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

06:54.707 --> 06:57.202
Now, you should all learn
from Pete's mistake.

06:57.378 --> 06:58.250
My wife's gonna kill me!

06:58.416 --> 07:00.210
You see, in poker
as in business,

07:00.377 --> 07:01.671
the key to success
is to determine

07:01.833 --> 07:05.381
your opponent's strength and,
more importantly, his weaknesses.

07:05.557 --> 07:08.263
Everyone has a tell--
a weakness of character

07:08.429 --> 07:10.182
that manifests itself
physically.

07:10.347 --> 07:11.091
Oh.

07:11.265 --> 07:15.810
Like when Lutz here has
a good hand, he stops eating.

07:15.976 --> 07:19.391
When Frank is bluffing, he asks
a series of insane questions to hide his nervousness.

07:19.568 --> 07:19.940
Oh, really?

07:20.106 --> 07:21.440
Is that what you think?
Is that what I do?

07:21.605 --> 07:24.192
Am I doing that right now?
Yeah, I'm out.

07:24.365 --> 07:26.940
Okay, Rainman,
tell me what I got.

07:27.118 --> 07:31.411
Well, you have two of your
cards backwards actually.

07:31.577 --> 07:34.030
I'm out.

07:34.206 --> 07:37.703
Hi.
Pinot grigio, please.

07:44.716 --> 07:48.551
This is beyond the pale.
Donaghy took me for $200.

07:48.717 --> 07:50.092
Yeah, well I bet
my rent money.

07:50.266 --> 07:53.090
And if I don't pay by the tenth,
my mom's gonna throw me out.

07:53.267 --> 07:54.640
I'm all in.
Anybody else?

07:54.808 --> 07:58.972
Oh, I'll play with you,
Mr. Donaghy.

07:59.477 --> 08:00.890
Kenneth, how long you been
sitting there?

08:01.066 --> 08:03.563
I'm taking Pete's place, 'cause
he's busy in the bathroom,

08:03.737 --> 08:07.112
laying in his own sick.

08:11.408 --> 08:12.403
Oh, my God.

08:12.576 --> 08:15.990
He can't read Kenneth.
He's a blank slate.

08:16.165 --> 08:18.790
Okay, what do you got?

08:18.958 --> 08:22.832
I think I have what they refer
to as a royal flush.

08:23.007 --> 08:26.790
Looks like
I'm the big winner.

08:34.225 --> 08:36.802
Thank you.

08:38.517 --> 08:40.770
Liz, hi.

08:40.936 --> 08:44.230
I'm Gretchen Thomas.
Jack's friend.

08:44.398 --> 08:47.773
Hey.
Great to meet you.

08:47.997 --> 08:50.151
Hi.

08:51.615 --> 08:54.150
Why would Jack just assume
that we're lesbians?

08:54.325 --> 08:55.611
I am a lesbian.

08:55.787 --> 08:57.913
Mm, that's awesome.

08:58.085 --> 09:02.203
Is this the first time somebody's made that
assumption about you?

09:02.375 --> 09:07.380
Lemon, don't let these girls
give you a hard time about who you are.

09:07.547 --> 09:11.383
You know, you need to brush
your teeth more, young man.

09:11.555 --> 09:15.801
Oh, my.
What an adorable little lesbian.

09:15.975 --> 09:17.513
What?
I don't know.

09:17.685 --> 09:19.302
Who remembers
that kind of thing?

09:19.477 --> 09:22.563
Well, look, obviously
this is a miscommunication.

09:22.727 --> 09:25.312
I mean, I'm certainly not
interested in chasing a straight girl.

09:25.487 --> 09:26.020
Of course, yeah.

09:26.198 --> 09:28.233
I completely understand
if you just want to go home.

09:28.407 --> 09:30.232
No, it's fine.
I'll stay.

09:30.405 --> 09:31.652
Jack is ridiculous.

09:31.827 --> 09:33.650
Oh, I worked with Jack in Plastics.

09:33.825 --> 09:35.952
He tends to approach
everything the same way.

09:36.115 --> 09:37.991
Locate the problem.
Isolate the problem.

09:38.166 --> 09:40.410
Set the problem up
with a lesbian.

09:40.586 --> 09:42.242
That's a pretty good joke
for somebody from Plastics.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.410
Well, I wasn't always in Plastics.

09:44.586 --> 09:46.501
I used to work in Water
and Process Technologies.

09:46.678 --> 09:48.040
Working mainly in primary metals.

09:48.216 --> 09:52.381
Oh, so you have
a comedy background.

09:58.398 --> 09:59.511
How was your evening with Thomas?

09:59.685 --> 10:04.271
You mean, Gretchen Thomas?
The brilliant plastics engineer/lesbian?

10:04.435 --> 10:06.690
What made you think I was gay?

10:06.856 --> 10:08.440
Your shoes.

10:08.606 --> 10:09.560
Well, I'm straight.

10:09.735 --> 10:11.570
Those shoes are definitely bi-curious.

10:11.735 --> 10:16.203
Regardless, I am straight.
100% completely straight.

10:16.365 --> 10:17.570
Well, I'm sorry
if I offended you.

10:17.746 --> 10:18.782
No, I'm not offended--

10:18.955 --> 10:19.822
G ood.

10:19.995 --> 10:22.123
What do you know
about Kenneth the page?

10:22.288 --> 10:23.331
I don't know.
He's a sweet kid.

10:23.498 --> 10:23.740
Yes.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.751
And a surprisingly good
poker player.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.251
Did you know that
his middle name is Ellen?

10:27.415 --> 10:27.831
No, that's weird.

10:28.006 --> 10:30.831
And that his Myers-Briggs-psychological testing shows
shows a rare combination

10:31.007 --> 10:32.881
of extroverted, intuitive
and aggressive?

10:33.058 --> 10:33.500
Really?

10:33.675 --> 10:34.171
The same as mine.

10:34.345 --> 10:35.671
He could be trouble
down the line.

10:35.846 --> 10:37.171
Kenneth.

10:37.346 --> 10:38.222
Kenneth Ellen.

10:38.386 --> 10:39.430
All right then.

10:39.596 --> 10:40.933
You're not a lesbian.
Duly noted.

10:41.097 --> 10:43.063
I'll correct that on your file.

10:43.225 --> 10:45.561
It's too bad, though.
Thomas thought
you were great.

10:45.726 --> 10:46.893
- She did?
- Yes.

10:47.065 --> 10:49.142
She said she thought you looked
like Jennifer Jason Leigh.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.403
Really?
She said that?

10:50.567 --> 10:56.031
Yes, I made her repeat it.
I was sure she meant Jason Lee.

11:03.586 --> 11:04.161
Miss Lemon.

11:04.335 --> 11:04.873
Yeah.

11:05.045 --> 11:06.501
This is Pete's wedding ring.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.662
I won it last night, but I don't
think I should keep it.

11:08.838 --> 11:09.833
Could you give it back
to him for me?

11:10.006 --> 11:11.961
Yeah, okay.

11:12.136 --> 11:13.001
Did you win this, too?

11:13.176 --> 11:14.343
I did.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.510
I love how the light
catches it like diamonds.

11:16.675 --> 11:19.382
Kenneth, it is diamonds.

11:19.555 --> 11:21.722
Ah.

11:22.095 --> 11:23.681
Hi, Mr. Donaghy.

11:23.857 --> 11:25.352
Can I help you
with something?

11:25.517 --> 11:29.561
You are a puzzle...
Kenneth Ellen.

11:30.275 --> 11:34.573
And I'm going to solve you.
Yes, I am.

11:38.367 --> 11:39.951
I can't believe you bet
your wedding ring.

11:40.115 --> 11:40.653
I know.

11:40.826 --> 11:43.533
The weird thing is
I had money left.

11:43.707 --> 11:46.331
Hey, um, what famous person
would you say I look like?

11:46.495 --> 11:47.740
Uh, present day
Linda Ronstadt.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.160
No, Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

11:49.336 --> 11:50.372
Tootsie.

11:50.546 --> 11:51.460
Never mind.

11:51.625 --> 11:52.752
So how was your date?

11:52.927 --> 11:54.133
It wasn't a good match.

11:54.296 --> 11:54.711
What happened?

11:54.886 --> 11:56.302
- Did he notice your facial tic?
- No.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.092
Did you wear sandals?

11:58.265 --> 11:59.880
- Did he see your toes?
- No.

12:00.058 --> 12:01.260
You blew it, didn't you?

12:01.438 --> 12:02.011
Good job, Liz.

12:02.187 --> 12:03.141
Way to go.

12:03.307 --> 12:04.341
Another one bites the dust.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.143
Ah, look at
your little face.

12:06.318 --> 12:09.141
It was a lady.

12:12.485 --> 12:15.440
Are you serious?

12:19.786 --> 12:22.781
Where is my Emmy?

12:43.688 --> 12:44.221
Hello?

12:44.387 --> 12:46.302
Hi, Gretchen.
It's Liz Lemon.

12:46.476 --> 12:48.432
Oh, hi.

12:48.607 --> 12:51.681
Look, thiss gonna sound
really weird, but, um,

12:51.857 --> 12:53.850
do you every worry about
choking to death

12:54.028 --> 12:55.441
alone in your apartment?

12:55.606 --> 12:57.860
Oh,  it's so weird
you would say that.

12:58.028 --> 12:59.532
I think about it
all the time.

12:59.698 --> 13:01.403
I mean, you'd die,
and they wouldn't find you

13:01.575 --> 13:04.150
until your neighbor's dog
smelled you from the hallway.

13:04.327 --> 13:07.121
Ugh, yes, and they'd show
a picture of you on New York One.

13:07.288 --> 13:08.121
And it's not just choking.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.700
Ever since I turned 30,
every time I get in or out

13:10.876 --> 13:13.872
of the bathtub,
I think in my head, "Careful, careful."

13:14.048 --> 13:14.712
Yes!

13:14.877 --> 13:15.712
Agh.

13:15.876 --> 13:18.630
Everything's the worst.

13:18.797 --> 13:19.963
Do you want to get some dinner?

13:20.136 --> 13:20.802
Sure.

13:20.968 --> 13:21.920
 See you in 20 at Neptune.

13:22.096 --> 13:23.422
Yeah, okay.
Perfect, yeah.

13:23.597 --> 13:26.510
Oh!
Ow, ow, ow!

13:29.185 --> 13:32.021
I did not die.

13:38.988 --> 13:42.033
Man, this is amazing.
Oh, hey, Jack.

13:42.195 --> 13:43.900
Welcome.
Welcome, everybody.

13:44.076 --> 13:46.532
Damn, Jack, you went all out.
That's a giant shrimp.

13:46.716 --> 13:49.412
Made out of shrimp and diving
into a bowl of shrimp.

13:49.585 --> 13:51.703
Please, enjoy it, Tracy.
Hey, Pete, good to see you.

13:51.876 --> 13:52.243
Jack.

13:52.416 --> 13:54.411
Is Kenneth here?

13:54.588 --> 13:57.542
I--I will check.

13:59.257 --> 14:01.213
I've been playing
for two hours.

14:01.385 --> 14:03.460
I'm tired of losing.

14:03.638 --> 14:06.841
I'm gonna let my boy, Dotcom,
play a hand for me.

14:07.016 --> 14:12.563
So, hey, Dotcom, are we going
to those three clubs tonight?

14:13.437 --> 14:16.230
You know the doctor said
I have four hearts in my body?

14:16.395 --> 14:17.353
All right.
Great.

14:17.526 --> 14:21.612
Of course he did.
Come on. Damn it.

14:22.946 --> 14:24.481
Hey, everybody,
this is Gretchen.

14:24.658 --> 14:25.820
Oh, hey.

14:25.997 --> 14:27.741
Oh, Thomas.

14:27.915 --> 14:28.452
Jack.

14:28.618 --> 14:29.660
How's everybody up there
in Pittsfield?

14:29.826 --> 14:31.703
Oh, we miss you.

14:31.876 --> 14:34.952
I love this woman.

14:39.637 --> 14:42.960
Let's play some poker.

14:47.676 --> 14:49.512
I call.

14:49.685 --> 14:51.602
What have you got, Kenneth?

14:51.767 --> 14:52.601
All clovers.

14:52.765 --> 14:55.141
I win.

14:55.607 --> 14:57.140
Very clever boy,
Kenneth.

14:57.316 --> 15:03.193
But the curtain has been drawn back now,
and I know the real you.

15:03.448 --> 15:08.072
I think he's confusing me
with someone else.

15:09.157 --> 15:10.743
Liz, are you sure
you're not gay?

15:10.915 --> 15:12.202
'Cause that chick is hot.

15:12.378 --> 15:15.243
We're just friends,
like Oprah and Gayle.

15:15.416 --> 15:20.122
Why is that so hard
for everybody to believe?

15:23.048 --> 15:26.052
She's great.
You should marry that girl.

15:26.215 --> 15:28.422
One problem.
I'm not gay.

15:28.598 --> 15:31.262
Oh, Lemon, in the ten years
that I've known you,

15:31.437 --> 15:33.511
you've had some really
terrible boyfriends.

15:33.688 --> 15:34.183
I have.

15:34.358 --> 15:35.890
There was the guy who was obsessed
with Charlie Chaplin.

15:36.065 --> 15:36.272
Neil.

15:36.437 --> 15:38.393
There was the guy
who played Halo under the name Slutbanger.

15:38.567 --> 15:38.772
Dennis.

15:38.937 --> 15:40.442
There was a tall,
gangly, red-haired guy

15:40.607 --> 15:41.603
who played guitar
all the time.

15:41.776 --> 15:42.903
Conan.

15:43.066 --> 15:45.902
You're more relaxed with Gretchen
than you were with any of those guys.

15:46.077 --> 15:46.693
So what are you
saying, Pete?

15:46.867 --> 15:48.071
I should just
be a lesbian?

15:48.246 --> 15:49.240
Well, I'm not saying it'll be easy.

15:49.405 --> 15:51.613
You know, get drunk first.

15:51.787 --> 15:54.493
Why do guys think women can
just flip a switch like that?

15:54.665 --> 15:56.913
What if I said to you,
"Go be with Frank now"?

15:57.088 --> 15:58.370
Ah, I would be honored.

15:58.545 --> 16:02.833
Frank is a very tender,
beautiful man.

16:12.435 --> 16:13.302
He's awesome.

16:13.478 --> 16:18.603
You can't read his thoughts,
'cause he doesn't have any.

16:18.776 --> 16:20.981
I raise you 200.

16:21.146 --> 16:25.362
And I see your 200
and raise you 300.

16:28.488 --> 16:33.862
Will you, little Kenneth Ellen Parcell
from Stone Mountain, Georgia?

16:34.035 --> 16:37.781
Growing up in your momma's tract house,
dreaming of working on a TV show?

16:37.957 --> 16:42.660
Dreaming of making it
all the way to the NBC.

16:42.877 --> 16:44.421
You're scaring me,
Mr. Donaghy.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.673
You've come a long way,
haven't you, Kenneth Ellen?

16:46.848 --> 16:49.513
With your cheap loafers
and your page jacket,

16:49.676 --> 16:51.761
but you'll always be
a pig farmer's son, boy.

16:51.928 --> 16:56.432
'Cause I smell fried bologna
all over you.

16:58.396 --> 17:00.933
I'm all in.

17:01.106 --> 17:03.190
I'm out of chips,
Mr. Donaghy.

17:03.357 --> 17:04.651
Hey, I got a fun idea.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.563
You put your page jacket
on the table,

17:06.737 --> 17:08.319
and if you win,
you can get it back.

17:08.486 --> 17:12.150
If you lose,
you go on home.

17:12.498 --> 17:15.162
You go on home,
little Kenneth Ellen.

17:15.325 --> 17:17.242
All the way
to Stone Mountain.

17:17.415 --> 17:18.202
He's bluffing.
Go for it.

17:18.375 --> 17:20.119
He's bluffing.
Come on, trust yourself.

17:20.298 --> 17:23.123
Trust yourself.
Don't do it.

17:23.295 --> 17:24.040
No!

17:24.217 --> 17:26.000
You can do it.

17:26.178 --> 17:26.632
Okay, okay.

17:26.797 --> 17:26.960
Come on.

17:27.137 --> 17:27.792
Use your instincts.

17:27.964 --> 17:29.041
You've got good instincts.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.801
Do it, Kenneth.

17:31.968 --> 17:34.472
I've got a pair
of twos.

17:34.635 --> 17:37.301
Well, let's just
see-weeby here.

17:37.478 --> 17:42.472
I've got a two, a four,
a nine, a six, and a King.

17:48.696 --> 17:51.691
That means I win.

18:01.125 --> 18:02.040
Kenneth.

18:02.208 --> 18:04.791
Why did you bet
that terrible hand?

18:04.965 --> 18:05.662
Why?

18:05.835 --> 18:09.751
Because...I believe
that life is for the living.

18:09.926 --> 18:12.963
I believe in taking risks
and biting off more than you can chew.

18:13.138 --> 18:14.261
And also,
people were yelling,

18:14.426 --> 18:18.513
and I got confused
about the rules.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.560
Kenneth.

18:22.858 --> 18:24.140
I wasn't really
going to fire you.

18:24.316 --> 18:27.063
I just wanted to remind you
that I could.

18:27.236 --> 18:30.021
I want you back here
at 6:00 in the morning sharp

18:30.197 --> 18:32.231
so you can sweep up
these shrimp tails.

18:32.408 --> 18:34.691
Yes, sir, Mr. Donaghy.

18:34.865 --> 18:36.902
Uh,  I'm gonna have my eye
on you, Kenneth.

18:37.076 --> 18:41.120
You will not be
disappointed, sir.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.830
Well, it was nice of you
to let him keep his job.

18:47.007 --> 18:49.001
The Italians
have a saying, Lemon.

18:49.178 --> 18:50.920
"Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer."

18:51.087 --> 18:52.502
And although they've
never won a war,

18:52.677 --> 18:57.263
or mass-produced a decent car,
in this area, they are correct.

18:57.428 --> 19:01.931
In five years, we'll all
either be working for him...

19:02.108 --> 19:05.472
or be dead by his hand.

19:09.396 --> 19:12.313
Hey, after Ikea tomorrow,
you wanna go see Margaret Cho at the Beacon?

19:12.487 --> 19:14.612
Oh, boy.
Um, Oprah?

19:14.786 --> 19:15.533
Yes, Gayle.

19:15.697 --> 19:17.402
I think we need
to take a break.

19:17.577 --> 19:19.743
Is this because I waused to
submit us for The Amazing Race?

19:19.918 --> 19:21.781
Because I was 80% joking
about that.

19:21.955 --> 19:23.450
No, it's--

19:23.628 --> 19:26.251
You know, I said I'm not
into chasing straight girls.

19:26.417 --> 19:29.790
And I kinda think that's
what's starting to happen here.

19:29.968 --> 19:32.500
So... unless you're ready to make
a big life change,

19:32.678 --> 19:35.713
I need to move on,
find my Steadman.

19:35.885 --> 19:37.923
I thought I was Oprah
in this metaphor.

19:38.098 --> 19:39.881
Also, you're gay,
so that's a little confusing.

19:40.055 --> 19:41.803
You should say, like,
"My lady Steadman."

19:41.976 --> 19:42.301
Okay.

19:42.477 --> 19:43.763
I'm going out
on a limb here.

19:43.938 --> 19:44.601
Okay, sorry.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.683
Um, it's just--

19:46.855 --> 19:49.311
If I try to imagine
us being together,

19:49.487 --> 19:52.272
I think, "Yeah, okay,
this could be fun, you know?

19:52.446 --> 19:57.032
"Picking out furniture and making flower beds
out of old railroad ties."

19:57.198 --> 20:01.110
But the thing is,
if I'm gonna be with someone,

20:01.288 --> 20:03.282
it has to be a guy.

20:03.455 --> 20:05.083
You sound pretty sure about that.

20:05.245 --> 20:06.082
What can I say?

20:06.245 --> 20:08.663
I love a bald spot
and a hairy back.

20:08.836 --> 20:11.172
You're alone there.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.881
I should go.

20:13.048 --> 20:14.590
I'll see you around.

20:14.755 --> 20:15.670
Okay, wait.

20:15.848 --> 20:16.963
Um, what if we made a pact?

20:17.137 --> 20:19.090
What if we say
that in, like, 25 years,

20:19.266 --> 20:20.763
if neither of us has someone,

20:20.926 --> 20:23.012
we'll move in together
and be roommates.

20:23.188 --> 20:26.722
And even though
I am not into the sex stuff,

20:26.895 --> 20:32.060
if it helps you... I would let you...
do stuff to me.

20:33.235 --> 20:34.730
I can't be around
you anymore.

20:34.908 --> 20:37.150
Bye, Liz.

20:37.325 --> 20:40.440
That's funny.
That's what the guys always say.

20:40.616 --> 20:43.162
Who's gonna go with me
to cooking class next weekend?

20:43.326 --> 20:45.412
Well, if by "cooking class"
you mean your bed,

20:45.577 --> 20:46.993
and by "next weekend"
you mean tonight--

20:47.036 --> 20:49.750
Oh, shut up.

20:50.918 --> 20:53.252
I can see your wedding ring.

20:53.428 --> 20:55.793
Idiot.
