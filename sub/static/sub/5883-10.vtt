WEBVTT

00:40.958 --> 00:43.376
-Butter.
-And the apples are good now,

00:43.460 --> 00:44.752
but not from the market.

00:44.837 --> 00:48.047
l can go to Rodney Farms on Sunday.
lt's near church.

00:48.132 --> 00:50.883
-Can't we go to Rodney Farms?
-We'll see.

00:51.510 --> 00:55.346
-Why don't we go to church?
-We go to church.

00:55.597 --> 00:58.224
On Christmas. Carla goes every Sunday.

00:59.977 --> 01:02.270
We don't need to go every week.

01:02.855 --> 01:04.355
Anything else?

01:06.316 --> 01:09.360
-lt's early. Do you want a drink?
-Yes.

01:11.697 --> 01:13.865
-How was school today?
-Good.

01:14.992 --> 01:16.993
How come you never ask me?

01:17.244 --> 01:22.290
l do. lt's just your answer is always longer,
so l thought l would start with Sally.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.625
When's Halloween?

01:25.502 --> 01:28.379
Before Thanksgiving.
Francine and Carlton have invited us,

01:28.464 --> 01:31.924
but l think if we're going to be
selling Daddy's house,

01:32.009 --> 01:35.845
l don't know, it might be nice
to have it there one last time.

01:39.183 --> 01:41.684
Are you going to sleep here tonight?

01:42.311 --> 01:43.352
No.

01:44.646 --> 01:46.230
You're working too much.

01:46.315 --> 01:50.276
-Betts, l don't have a choice.
-No, that's not what l mean. l just...

01:50.360 --> 01:52.612
l see how hard you're working.

02:00.412 --> 02:01.579
Hello.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.749
lnside.

02:10.464 --> 02:13.382
-Were you grading papers?
-Why?

02:19.807 --> 02:22.683
l don't know if you're hungry,
but l made date nut bread.

02:22.768 --> 02:25.228
Actually, l made three. Bake sale.

02:29.191 --> 02:32.527
Your service called.
Mr. Hilton was looking for you,

02:32.778 --> 02:35.488
but he's probably in the air right now.

02:36.615 --> 02:40.076
Thanks, Miss Farrell. That's good to know.

02:41.245 --> 02:42.703
l thought so.

02:46.250 --> 02:48.793
l want you to spend the whole night.

03:14.319 --> 03:17.071
You couldn't possibly be asleep already.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.830
This eight-year-old, Charlie,

03:27.124 --> 03:29.959
looked up at me during art today and said,

03:31.086 --> 03:35.590
"How do l know if what l see as blue
is the same as it is to you?"

03:40.012 --> 03:41.637
What did you say?

03:42.306 --> 03:44.849
The truth. l don't know.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.144
l never have,

03:48.979 --> 03:52.189
but l love that he made me
think about that again.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.986
What would you have said?

03:58.238 --> 04:00.823
l would have told Charlie

04:02.492 --> 04:04.327
that my job is about

04:05.454 --> 04:08.456
boiling down communication
to its essentials,

04:09.416 --> 04:12.668
and that l know that there is a blue

04:14.046 --> 04:17.423
that at least 45% of the population
sees as the same.

04:18.842 --> 04:22.386
Maybe half those people think
they're looking at yellow.

04:22.512 --> 04:27.308
Maybe, but the truth is,
people may see things differently,

04:28.936 --> 04:31.187
but they don't really want to.

04:33.857 --> 04:36.317
Do you feel bad about what you do?

04:38.195 --> 04:41.364
Nobody feels as good about what they do
as you do.

04:44.451 --> 04:45.910
That's sweet.

04:47.829 --> 04:52.249
l wish l could've known you at eight.
l bet you were serious.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.588
And l would've liked you.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.134
Long curly hair.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.723
No one has it anymore.

05:22.239 --> 05:25.157
-Why don't you take her?
-Because l said no.

05:25.367 --> 05:29.286
-You'd rather not go than go with me?
-What do you think Mr. Draper would say

05:29.371 --> 05:33.165
if you showed up at the Sterling Cooper
40th with his secretary?

05:33.250 --> 05:34.458
Good morning, Mr. Draper.

05:34.543 --> 05:36.085
-Coffee?
-Morning, Don.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.962
Morning, fellas. Yes.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.715
-Aqua Net, 9:00.
-Get Peggy.

05:40.799 --> 05:43.342
Don, if you could stand over there.

05:43.927 --> 05:45.928
lt's Paul Kinsey theater.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.350
This was my thought.

05:51.435 --> 05:54.729
Aqua Net is about hold,
but it's also about beauty.

05:56.898 --> 06:00.943
So, we're driving. Two couples.
l call it "Double Date."

06:01.778 --> 06:05.865
The woman in the back's scarf blows off
and her hair starts blowing.

06:05.949 --> 06:08.784
-Her hairdo falls apart.
-Oh, no!

06:09.119 --> 06:11.203
And then the woman in front
takes off her scarf

06:11.288 --> 06:13.497
and hands it back to the woman in the back.

06:13.582 --> 06:16.751
-Take mine.
-And he says, "Are you sure, Marcia?"

06:17.461 --> 06:19.462
Marcia's hair is perfect.

06:20.714 --> 06:24.050
And then her date gives her
a knowing smile of admiration

06:24.134 --> 06:26.010
on her confident smile.

06:26.303 --> 06:29.263
"Aqua Net. Arrive in style."

06:32.434 --> 06:34.769
Too much story.
Every time l hear, "And then,"

06:34.853 --> 06:38.773
there's another chance
for the ladies at home to misunderstand.

06:39.316 --> 06:42.777
What if it's just the two couples,
the wind is blowing,

06:42.986 --> 06:44.987
the woman in the back
has to put on her kerchief

06:45.072 --> 06:48.491
and she just looks longingly
at Miss Perfect in front?

06:48.825 --> 06:51.494
-Okay.
-"Arrive in style" still works.

06:52.704 --> 06:55.164
And at the end,
you could see the can with a kerchief,

06:55.248 --> 06:56.749
like a see-through one over it

06:56.833 --> 06:59.919
and the wind blows it off
to reveal the Aqua Net.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.754
A kerchief in a can?

07:02.339 --> 07:05.091
Don't use that, but very nice.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.968
Well, great, then.

07:08.678 --> 07:12.848
-What do you have for Western Union?
-We don't meet until next week.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.767
Hilton takes precedence,

07:14.851 --> 07:16.936
so l need you two to be ready for me
at a moment's notice.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.605
And it has to be TV
to compete with the phone company.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.775
l love getting telegrams,
but l never send them.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.487
How is that supposed to help?

07:28.657 --> 07:30.032
l've got it.

07:32.744 --> 07:35.454
My goodness. This is where everyone is.

07:36.414 --> 07:38.666
Allison, my dear, do you mind?

07:41.628 --> 07:43.796
All the paperwork is through
on your contract.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.591
lt is my pleasure
to deliver your signing bonus personally.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.886
You see, l don't just fire people.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.640
So we finally have an answer
to the question,

07:54.724 --> 07:59.395
"What makes Don Draper smile?"
$5,000 seems to be the number.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.982
l don't know why it took two months.

08:03.233 --> 08:06.485
Will your amigo Connie Hilton
be attending the anniversary party Friday?

08:06.570 --> 08:09.071
-ln his dressiest Stetson.
-Splendid.

08:09.948 --> 08:13.659
You will be speaking last.
lt's prime time. Please prepare.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.997
l'm sorry to interrupt.
Mr. Pryce, your wife is here

08:18.081 --> 08:20.082
and has requested
your attention immediately.

08:20.167 --> 08:21.917
-Where?
-Your office.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.463
-What's going on?
-l'll find out.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.048
No, it's okay.

08:33.305 --> 08:35.931
-Mr. Kinsey to see you.
-What was that?

08:36.266 --> 08:38.267
Thank you, Olive. What?

08:38.351 --> 08:41.478
l don't need you to put your little swirl
on top of my idea.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.772
-No one's keeping score.
-l am.

08:44.065 --> 08:46.192
And every time we work together,
it looks like you carried the load

08:46.276 --> 08:48.194
because you're spontaneous,
and you're a girl,

08:48.278 --> 08:50.696
and you're his favorite
and you use Aqua Net.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.282
-Are you nuts? He hates me.
-That's rich.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.493
Wearing a dress isn't gonna help you
with Western Union.

08:56.578 --> 09:00.623
You do your work. l'll do mine.
Let the chips fall where they may.

09:04.169 --> 09:06.253
Mrs. Pryce, your water.

09:07.005 --> 09:11.091
-Thank you ever so much, John.
-Will there be anything else?

09:18.642 --> 09:22.895
-He's such a toad.
-He is. He is. Darling, please, sit down.

09:22.979 --> 09:26.607
No. l'm not going to let you force me
to do anything anymore.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.901
Am l to entertain
your ballad of dissatisfaction,

09:28.985 --> 09:32.905
or has something actually happened?
Because l am at work, dear.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.786
l'm so sorry.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.374
l went to pick up my gown.

09:43.583 --> 09:47.920
The queue for the taxi was 1 0 long
with those fat ladies in their furs.

09:48.004 --> 09:51.090
Finally l think l'm en route,
but l see the park,

09:51.174 --> 09:52.758
and l insist it's the wrong direction,

09:52.842 --> 09:55.552
and he's obviously running up my fare,
which he was.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.846
-l'm so sorry, darling.
-l had to stop here

09:57.931 --> 10:00.599
because l'd already taken
a $2.25 tour of Harlem

10:00.684 --> 10:04.728
-and that was all the money l had.
-We'll get you home right away.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.773
Do you have enough cash
to get me to London?

10:07.857 --> 10:09.984
Because this is not my home.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.487
-These things take time.
-Not for you.

10:14.155 --> 10:18.450
lf a superior demands that you be happy,
you say, "Yes, sir. Right away, sir."

10:18.535 --> 10:21.036
Go on. Let's have it all, shall we?

10:21.705 --> 10:23.372
You like it here.

10:23.665 --> 10:27.459
The smells and the noise
and the criminals at every level.

10:27.836 --> 10:30.045
l have made the best of this.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.881
My salary is good.
The company is flourishing.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.175
My wife has a beautiful gown.

10:36.219 --> 10:37.720
May l see it?

10:39.681 --> 10:41.265
lt's not London.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.310
-lt's not even England.
-That's true.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.646
l've been here 1 0 months
and no one's ever asked me

10:47.731 --> 10:49.606
where l went to school.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.988
-l want to scream.
-Don't.

10:57.532 --> 10:58.866
Roll over.

11:08.626 --> 11:11.378
-Just a minute!
-Why did you answer?

11:21.765 --> 11:23.390
l had to see you.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.268
l called you from the bus station
in New Haven

11:26.353 --> 11:28.937
before l started hitching.
You never answered.

11:29.022 --> 11:32.274
l'm so sorry. Can you give me a minute?

11:38.281 --> 11:42.201
-lt's my brother.
-Get rid of him for 1 5 minutes. l'll run out.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.120
No, it's okay, Don. Come outside.

11:45.455 --> 11:49.291
No. So there's a man in here.
He doesn't need to know it's me.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.795
l want you to meet him.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.714
l don't want to ruin this.

11:57.509 --> 11:58.842
lt's okay.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.470
l promise.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.863
Danny, l'd like you to meet my friend Don.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.826
-Sorry to interrupt.
-Danny, be polite.

12:24.327 --> 12:25.994
l really am sorry.

12:26.830 --> 12:30.624
-What happened there?
-ls it bad under there? Are you hungry?

12:31.418 --> 12:34.169
-No.
-Well, l should be going.

12:38.174 --> 12:41.677
Listen, l know what it looks like,
but l'm not a junkie.

12:44.222 --> 12:48.684
Although apparently l'm too dangerous
to push a cart in a public library.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.522
-He has fits.
-l'm sorry.

12:54.232 --> 12:56.692
l interrupted you. lt's a nice night.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.695
-l'll see you in the morning, Suzy.
-Stop it.

13:03.741 --> 13:06.743
-l wish you the best.
-You don't even know me.

13:14.085 --> 13:16.336
-l'll call you.
-Tomorrow.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.894
He could've just stayed
inside your bedroom.

13:31.978 --> 13:36.231
l wanted you two to meet.
You're my baby brother.

13:38.276 --> 13:41.737
Well, he knows how to leave a room.
Reminds me of Mom.

13:42.655 --> 13:47.493
-He's just very private.
-He's arrogant. His plans were interrupted.

13:47.577 --> 13:49.286
You don't know him.

13:53.333 --> 13:56.960
l'm going to get you anotherjob.
Someplace safe.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.087
Safe.

14:00.131 --> 14:03.759
Other people are the problem.
Name such a place.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.261
People are ignorant.

14:07.347 --> 14:10.432
They're scared of things
they don't understand.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.650
l'm really hungry.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.281
1 923. We were giddy.

14:27.325 --> 14:30.327
We didn't know the soup
was gonna hit the fan,

14:30.495 --> 14:34.081
-but we made it through.
-All these guys are dead.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.668
Except you, of course.

14:38.461 --> 14:43.924
And Doug Thompson, but l wish he were.
He let me eat a whole roll of Bolls Laxatives.

14:44.008 --> 14:48.011
l thought they were candies.
l want him to show up and keel over.

14:48.471 --> 14:51.056
Damn it.
l don't want to go to another funeral.

14:51.140 --> 14:54.226
Well, l'm not really gonna kill him.
l just would like to, that's all.

14:54.310 --> 14:57.938
Fortieth anniversary.
Forty would be an insignificant year

14:58.022 --> 15:01.733
were it not the average lifespan
of a man in this business.

15:02.110 --> 15:06.655
l don't think it's a bad idea to have a chance
to out-drink your clientele.

15:08.825 --> 15:11.410
Who am l kidding?
l don't want to go either.

15:11.494 --> 15:15.122
Have to watch Don Draper
accept an award for his humanity?

15:15.290 --> 15:18.333
-Don is important.
-You know, l found that guy

15:18.710 --> 15:21.670
working in a fur company, night school.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.965
And that girl, Betty.

15:25.049 --> 15:29.636
l remember Mona said they looked like
they were on top of our wedding cake.

15:30.555 --> 15:34.683
-Screw him.
-Have the party without me. l can't do it.

15:36.644 --> 15:37.853
l won't.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.023
Okay. Okay.

15:42.358 --> 15:45.402
lt's just a party. lf you don't want to go,
you don't have to go.

15:45.486 --> 15:48.488
lt's not like
it's our company anymore anyway.

15:50.366 --> 15:53.201
My God. Remember her?

15:57.790 --> 16:00.125
It's 100,000 bucks...

16:02.629 --> 16:04.713
-Can l?
-lf you do it right.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.638
Hello, Draper residence.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.433
Hello?

16:17.977 --> 16:20.562
There's nobody there. They hanged up.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.148
Hang it up.

16:27.195 --> 16:28.612
Why'd they hang up?

16:28.696 --> 16:31.490
Probably a wrong number.
People do it all the time.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.950
But l could hear somebody
and they heard me.

16:34.035 --> 16:38.205
My goodness, Sally Draper,
try not to take everything so personally.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.417
Jeez Louise.

17:05.191 --> 17:09.277
The phone is cheap.
lt's everyday, and you can't trust it.

17:11.656 --> 17:18.203
The telegraph is honest and solid and clear.
lt's old, but it's good.

17:20.456 --> 17:21.873
Traditional.

17:25.753 --> 17:27.713
Sorry about that, Olive.

18:41.579 --> 18:42.746
Peggy.

18:45.541 --> 18:48.251
-Peggy!
-Hello?

18:56.803 --> 18:59.888
-Did you see a girl come through here?
-No, sir.

19:01.766 --> 19:04.434
-l'm Paul, by the way.
-l'm Achilles.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.771
Achilles. Well, hello, Achilles.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.733
-Are you okay?
-Are you Greek?

19:12.735 --> 19:15.570
-l'm an American citizen.
-No, of course.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.907
lt's just, that's a mighty big name.

19:20.660 --> 19:24.913
-How did that happen?
-Well, it's been in my family for generations.

19:25.581 --> 19:28.625
When we have a party
and someone says, "Achilles,"

19:28.709 --> 19:30.919
all the men turn their heads.

19:31.045 --> 19:33.380
-ln fact, one Christmas...
-Hush.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.262
l've got it.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.597
You've got what?

19:42.974 --> 19:46.518
Achilles, l have thought of something
very, very good.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.856
-Glad to hear it.
-lt's truly great news.

19:51.107 --> 19:53.775
-Yeah, your whole face changed.
-Did it?

19:55.278 --> 19:59.948
Well, l think l shall sleep
very soundly tonight. l wish you the same.

20:36.819 --> 20:38.320
ls that taken?

20:40.615 --> 20:41.656
Hey.

20:44.785 --> 20:48.747
l'll only stay for a stop.
l tried to catch you on the platform.

20:49.040 --> 20:52.334
-What are you doing here?
-l needed to talk to you.

21:01.010 --> 21:03.428
Did you call my house last night?

21:04.555 --> 21:06.431
No, l didn't.

21:10.144 --> 21:12.354
-This was a mistake.
-Sit down.

21:14.231 --> 21:15.565
l'm sorry.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.118
You said you'd call me.

21:28.579 --> 21:30.455
Your brother is there.

21:32.875 --> 21:36.670
l don't care about your marriage
or your work or any of that,

21:37.338 --> 21:39.714
as long as l know you're with me.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.934
l'm sorry.

21:55.356 --> 21:58.942
l got him a job
at the VA Hospital in Bedford.

22:02.029 --> 22:05.240
He'll be pushing a broom,
but it has nice grounds.

22:08.911 --> 22:12.205
You can come by tonight. He'll be gone.

22:13.708 --> 22:15.583
-Are you sure?
-Stop it.

22:16.752 --> 22:23.883
Scarborough! Briarcliff Manor!

22:30.224 --> 22:32.183
lt was nice meeting you.

22:54.290 --> 22:55.623
Mr. Kinsey.

22:57.668 --> 22:58.793
Paul!

23:00.337 --> 23:02.756
Sorry to wake you. lt's 9:00 a.m.

23:05.134 --> 23:07.635
-Good morning, Lois.
-Good morning.

23:10.681 --> 23:13.224
l need you to type something for me.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.906
-Were you in here before?
-No.

23:27.990 --> 23:30.992
-So you haven't touched anything?
-No.

23:32.036 --> 23:33.912
You do that sometimes.

23:40.503 --> 23:43.171
-What was it?
-Does it look like l know?

23:44.006 --> 23:45.590
l wrote it down.

23:46.509 --> 23:48.384
l know l wrote it down.

23:49.762 --> 23:54.015
Did you find it?
lt's always the last place you look.

23:56.185 --> 23:59.771
My mother always said
to retrace your steps if you lost something.

23:59.855 --> 24:01.981
Good God, would you shut up?

24:03.984 --> 24:08.113
"ln conclusion,
with the help of Sterling Cooper,

24:09.198 --> 24:11.366
"its ingenuity and influence,

24:12.493 --> 24:15.578
"America is teaching business
to the world."

24:19.375 --> 24:21.042
Very rousing, sir.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.754
Churchill rousing or Hitler rousing?

24:30.803 --> 24:32.554
Mr. Pryce's office.

24:33.764 --> 24:35.640
Just a moment, please.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.726
London calling. Mr. Ford.

24:42.189 --> 24:44.691
-Harold.
-Just calling for a status report

24:44.775 --> 24:46.317
on our little party.

24:46.402 --> 24:50.446
All is well, although as of late,
Bert Cooper will be in absentia.

24:50.573 --> 24:51.865
Well, that won't do.

24:51.949 --> 24:55.285
We're flying across the pond.
We expect all the flowers in the vase.

24:56.078 --> 24:58.371
-What does that mean?
-Look, Lane,

24:58.581 --> 25:00.957
we've had interest in the company
for some months

25:01.041 --> 25:03.626
and this party is essential
to attracting a second suitor.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.420
For what purpose?

25:06.380 --> 25:09.424
Did we reach you at a bad time?
You seem foggy.

25:12.761 --> 25:14.888
-Saint John here.
-Hello.

25:15.431 --> 25:18.057
Lane, Sterling Cooper is for sale.

25:19.518 --> 25:20.768
But why?

25:21.520 --> 25:24.606
We've reduced the staff
and increased the revenue by 22%.

25:25.024 --> 25:30.612
l think you've answered your own question.
We need this party to encourage interest.

25:31.947 --> 25:34.449
-Do your best, lad.
-Yes, of course.

25:41.749 --> 25:45.043
-Are you quite all right, sir?
-Yes. That'll be all.

26:00.059 --> 26:03.811
Henry Francis, please. lt's Betty Draper.

26:15.950 --> 26:18.368
How are you? What a nice surprise.

26:19.161 --> 26:22.247
l was wondering
if you called my home last night.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.166
No. No, l didn't.

26:26.669 --> 26:29.879
Well, we had a hang-up.
l thought it might be you.

26:31.674 --> 26:32.799
Really?

26:33.717 --> 26:35.718
l'm terribly embarrassed.

26:36.387 --> 26:38.263
Do you want me to call you?

26:39.223 --> 26:41.933
-No.
-But you thought it was me.

26:46.146 --> 26:47.814
What are you laughing at?

26:48.232 --> 26:52.110
l didn't call you and l'm not going to,
but if you're gonna call me, call me.

26:52.861 --> 26:54.737
Don't make up excuses.

26:55.030 --> 26:56.990
l'm not playing a game here.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.410
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Betty.

27:06.709 --> 27:08.376
Try to look at this
from Monica's point of view.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.045
-Do you mind? This is rather serious.
-Go ahead.

27:11.130 --> 27:14.424
Monica wants to get married
with or without Jimmy...

27:17.094 --> 27:19.887
lt has come to my attention

27:21.015 --> 27:24.392
that you're not attending
the Sterling Cooper 40th anniversary.

27:24.476 --> 27:28.479
l wouldn't have told Roger
if l planned on it remaining a secret.

27:33.360 --> 27:34.944
ln Great Britain

27:35.779 --> 27:38.156
we have a good deal of testimonials,

27:38.240 --> 27:41.451
and the senior members
are all equally unenthused.

27:42.494 --> 27:46.205
lt marks the passage of time.
lt's painful, l imagine.

27:47.791 --> 27:51.085
l didn't get to where l am
by dwelling on the past.

27:53.464 --> 27:58.343
So think of the future,
all of our clients, all of our staff,

27:58.969 --> 28:01.929
the press, newspapers
and trade publications.

28:02.723 --> 28:05.141
Enjoy the fruit of your longevity.

28:06.352 --> 28:09.604
You really pour the honey on,
then you lick it off.

28:11.940 --> 28:15.068
Well, if you care about
Sterling Cooper at all,

28:15.319 --> 28:20.114
remember that your absence
will make everyone think you are ill.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.958
Who told you l was vain?

28:32.127 --> 28:33.336
Please.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.172
lt's obvious.

31:01.109 --> 31:04.111
l want to show Mommy. Mommy!

31:05.364 --> 31:07.615
-Maybe she's not here.
-Carla.

31:09.618 --> 31:12.245
-Are you feeling all right?
-l'm fine.

31:13.121 --> 31:17.041
l want you to take the children to the park.
Don't come home...

31:18.418 --> 31:22.255
Just... Dinnertime would be perfect.
Take them to the library.

31:29.137 --> 31:30.304
Hello.

31:37.479 --> 31:39.272
l'm glad to see you.

31:41.149 --> 31:42.441
Sorry again.

31:42.526 --> 31:47.154
We were gonna leave after school
and l am still here, obviously.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.951
You want to wait here for me?
He has to report tomorrow.

31:53.704 --> 31:55.913
Let me do it. Let me drive him.

31:55.998 --> 31:58.291
-Where are you going again?
-Bedford, Mass.

31:58.375 --> 32:02.169
-lt's a long drive, Don.
-And you'll have to come back alone.

32:03.672 --> 32:05.590
Let me do this for you.

32:06.550 --> 32:10.803
l don't want to say goodbye up there.
lt's gonna come out ungrateful.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.440
There's $375 there, okay?

32:25.527 --> 32:27.987
How many times have you done this?

32:51.762 --> 32:53.763
Don't you need to gas up?

32:54.473 --> 32:57.308
-No, we're fine.
-So you're not gonna stop?

32:59.936 --> 33:01.729
Do you need to stop?

33:04.399 --> 33:06.692
l have some movie in my head
where l give you the slip,

33:06.777 --> 33:10.237
but l might as well tell you.
l'm not going to Bedford.

33:12.491 --> 33:15.576
Well, l am, so l guess you kind of have to.

33:18.246 --> 33:21.916
Why do you care?
You're just gonna go back and screw her.

33:25.671 --> 33:28.756
l don't know
if you're capable of understanding,

33:29.216 --> 33:32.510
-but that job is important.
-Did you get me the job?

33:32.886 --> 33:34.720
-No.
-So shut up.

33:35.847 --> 33:40.434
l'm not retarded.
Julius Caesar had epilepsy. He ran Rome.

33:40.644 --> 33:42.687
Things didn't turn out so well for him.

33:42.771 --> 33:46.816
l know what's waiting for me at that place.
l'm 25 years old, Don.

33:47.609 --> 33:50.695
l don't want to be cleaning toilets
until l die.

33:55.575 --> 33:57.118
Just pull over.

34:12.342 --> 34:14.719
-Hold on.
-What?

34:17.055 --> 34:18.806
l'm older than you,

34:19.349 --> 34:22.768
and l'm telling you it seems bad now,
but you can still change things.

34:22.853 --> 34:27.189
-Pull myself up by the bootstraps?
-Does that just sound stupid to you?

34:29.985 --> 34:31.861
How do l explain this?

34:33.655 --> 34:36.198
l can't do anything that you can do.

34:38.034 --> 34:41.954
Everyone knows, sooner or later,
that there's something wrong with me.

34:42.038 --> 34:44.081
They're kind and they try,

34:44.666 --> 34:47.376
but then when l come to
with piss in my pants,

34:47.461 --> 34:50.463
they stare at me
like l'm from another planet.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.258
l am afflicted, okay?

34:56.094 --> 34:59.263
lt's not a question of will.
l can't change that.

35:02.768 --> 35:05.019
-Do you need money?
-Always.

35:13.403 --> 35:16.697
l swore to myself
l would try to do this right once.

35:16.990 --> 35:18.199
Do what?

35:19.367 --> 35:22.703
l want you to call me if you ever need to.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.124
And l want you to remember,

35:27.918 --> 35:32.087
if something happens to you,
your sister will never forgive herself.

35:35.717 --> 35:38.219
You're not gonna tell her, are you?

35:38.386 --> 35:41.597
That l let you out
20 miles outside of Framingham?

35:50.732 --> 35:52.066
Take care.

36:42.742 --> 36:46.996
l know he thought l was passing him off,
but he means the world to me.

36:49.374 --> 36:50.875
He knows that.

36:58.008 --> 36:59.967
What was the place like?

37:01.511 --> 37:03.512
-Nice.
-Bullshit.

37:07.684 --> 37:09.935
He'll be as good as he can be.

37:17.986 --> 37:19.820
Don, l don't want to.

37:21.323 --> 37:22.573
l don't.

37:24.826 --> 37:26.160
lt's okay.

38:27.389 --> 38:29.682
-Coffee?
-No.

38:31.226 --> 38:33.644
Can you get my wife on the phone?

38:44.406 --> 38:46.824
-Betty.
-Where were you last night?

38:48.284 --> 38:51.996
-l told you, l was with Hilton.
-Well, l must have forgotten.

38:52.205 --> 38:54.289
Well, did you remember
to pick up my tuxedo?

38:54.374 --> 38:56.458
Yesterday. lt's in the closet.

38:56.543 --> 39:00.004
I'll get home at 5:30.
We should leave within the hour.

39:00.505 --> 39:02.464
l don't know.
l don't know if l'm going to go.

39:03.383 --> 39:05.926
-What's wrong?
-"What's wrong?"

39:06.553 --> 39:08.095
"What's wrong?"

39:11.975 --> 39:13.392
l don't feel well.

39:14.102 --> 39:17.730
Get into bed and grab a hot water bottle.
You have seven hours.

39:18.314 --> 39:22.276
It's all the clients and all the partners,
and they're all expecting me to show up

39:22.360 --> 39:25.654
with the glamorous, elegant,
stunning Betty Draper.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.826
l want to show you off, Betts.

39:33.246 --> 39:34.329
Okay.

39:39.627 --> 39:41.920
You ready? Don's expecting us.

39:43.089 --> 39:44.715
l've got nothing.

39:46.342 --> 39:50.637
-What a relief. Mine's garbage, too.
-No, l had something,

39:51.306 --> 39:54.016
something incredible, but l lost it.

39:57.353 --> 39:59.271
l didn't write it down.

40:01.733 --> 40:05.611
-l hate that.
-lt might've been the best idea l ever had.

40:06.780 --> 40:09.406
l did everything. l talked to Achilles.

40:09.491 --> 40:12.076
l spent last night recreating
every detail of the evening,

40:12.160 --> 40:14.203
hoping it would come back.

40:14.496 --> 40:17.498
You know how it is.
There was nothing and then there was it,

40:17.582 --> 40:21.001
-and now it's nothing again.
-l'm so sorry.

40:23.505 --> 40:28.050
-How do you talk to Achilles?
-He's a janitor with a very bad memory.

40:30.136 --> 40:32.346
You know what the Chinese say?

40:33.389 --> 40:36.600
"The faintest ink is better
than the best memory."

40:38.770 --> 40:41.230
Come on. We've failed before.

40:54.911 --> 40:57.538
Okay, we really looked for advantages.

40:58.039 --> 41:00.958
One of them is,
phone calls happen every day.

41:01.042 --> 41:05.462
A telegram's a big deal.
Something like, "She's getting married.

41:05.755 --> 41:08.298
"Are you really just going
to give her a call?"

41:08.383 --> 41:13.220
Sounds like you're talking to her parents.
They should really be at that wedding.

41:13.930 --> 41:16.473
Also, old people love them.

41:18.268 --> 41:22.563
-"When you care, send one there."
-That's a slogan, not an idea. Paul?

41:23.314 --> 41:27.151
-Mine aren't any better.
-Damn it, Kinsey. What's your excuse?

41:27.777 --> 41:30.028
-Don't yell at him.
-Excuse me?

41:32.240 --> 41:34.116
Tell him what happened.

41:34.909 --> 41:35.909
No.

41:38.955 --> 41:42.583
The dog ate my homework.
l had a great idea and l lost it.

41:43.418 --> 41:45.294
l didn't write it down.

41:49.591 --> 41:51.592
l hate when that happens.

41:52.594 --> 41:56.471
l keep thinking about that Chinese thing
you said. What was it?

41:56.556 --> 41:59.766
"The faintest ink is better
than the best memory."

42:00.685 --> 42:04.438
lt just makes me think...
You call someone on the phone,

42:05.273 --> 42:09.151
"Hello, l'm getting married"
or, "Congratulations on the baby,"

42:09.569 --> 42:12.279
and then you hang up. lt's gone.

42:15.033 --> 42:18.994
lt's different if you send a telegram.
A telegram is permanent.

42:21.372 --> 42:24.917
Something like, "A telegram is forever."

42:27.420 --> 42:29.713
"You can't frame a phone call."

42:34.928 --> 42:36.136
My God.

42:38.514 --> 42:41.808
That's the way to go.
You two keep working on that.

42:44.145 --> 42:45.896
When do you want it?

42:46.481 --> 42:49.149
The party's tonight. Monday.

42:52.987 --> 42:55.447
See? lt all works out.

43:02.497 --> 43:04.331
Betts, are you ready?

43:05.124 --> 43:08.460
-The car's downstairs.
-The driver's Chinese.

43:10.129 --> 43:11.588
Ready, Betts?

43:22.183 --> 43:24.184
Look how pretty Mommy is.

43:27.939 --> 43:31.108
-Where are we going?
-The WaldorfAstoria, Mummy.

43:31.859 --> 43:33.902
Well, then we passed it.
lt's on Fifth Avenue.

43:33.987 --> 43:36.196
lt's on Park. Moved years ago.

43:37.031 --> 43:40.617
That's right. That's right.
When did they ever do that?

43:43.162 --> 43:45.664
Enjoy the world as it is, Margaret.

43:45.999 --> 43:49.001
They'll change it
and never give you a reason.

43:49.460 --> 43:52.838
Mummy, she's not Margaret, she's Jane.
She's my wife.

43:54.716 --> 43:57.676
-Does Mona know?
-Yes, she knows.

44:09.897 --> 44:13.942
You seem surprised that there's traffic.
There's always traffic.

44:15.153 --> 44:18.071
Calm yourself. We'll arrive when we arrive.

44:19.574 --> 44:22.159
-They're selling the company.
-What?

44:24.078 --> 44:26.455
They're selling Sterling Cooper.

44:26.748 --> 44:29.041
-When?
-l have no idea.

44:30.460 --> 44:34.546
-What happens to the Americans?
-They'll go to the highest bidder.

44:38.551 --> 44:40.677
l know you hate uncertainty,

44:40.887 --> 44:44.514
but take comfort in the fact
that we'll return to England.

44:55.109 --> 44:58.570
I'm gonna keep going on
and make Don Draper wait,

44:58.654 --> 45:01.156
because God knows
we've all waited for him.

45:04.285 --> 45:08.121
As if being decorated
for his service in Korea weren't enough,

45:08.539 --> 45:11.291
his career has yielded even more awards.

45:12.251 --> 45:16.505
The American Association ofAdvertising
Agencies' Arthur Kudner Award,

45:16.672 --> 45:19.800
Printers' Ink magazine's
advertising gold medal,

45:20.051 --> 45:24.888
the Advertising Writers Association
of New York... l'm not reading all of these.

45:27.475 --> 45:32.562
He's loyal, charming, quiet but not modest.
Why should he be?

45:34.315 --> 45:36.775
We have to thank his beautiful wife, Betty,

45:36.859 --> 45:39.986
and his three children,
for sharing him with us,

45:40.196 --> 45:44.950
because as we all know, sometimes
Sterling Cooper has gotten the lion's share.

45:45.785 --> 45:49.162
Bert Cooper and my father,
Roger Sterling Sr.,

45:49.497 --> 45:52.249
bravely set this in motion 40 years ago.

45:53.167 --> 45:54.501
And now let me introduce the man

45:54.585 --> 45:57.587
who will stand alongside me
for the next 40 years,

45:57.672 --> 46:02.759
our creative director, partner,
father, husband

46:03.845 --> 46:07.013
and friend, Donald Draper.

46:22.738 --> 46:25.198
Please. Please.

46:27.577 --> 46:28.785
Please.

46:30.746 --> 46:32.372
l'm very honored.
