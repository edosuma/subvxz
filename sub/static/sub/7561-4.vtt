WEBVTT

01:28.560 --> 01:30.599
Walking on the highway
is prohibited.

01:32.240 --> 01:35.039
- Can I see your papers?
- Of course.

01:36.520 --> 01:39.839
I'll take you to a petrol station,
you'll find your way from there.

02:16.520 --> 02:20.399
Milan. Milan, I can't go on.
I can't.

02:20.520 --> 02:22.519
Never mind.
They're not following us.

02:22.640 --> 02:26.479
- I really can't go on.
- Come on, come on.

02:26.600 --> 02:30.079
- No more.
- Come on, come on.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.039
He never stopped asking
if you were alive.

02:46.720 --> 02:51.399
He never forgot the day his dog
died, so he keeps asking everything.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.359
All kinds of things.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.839
We missed you so much.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.719
Mihajlo, go play in your room.

03:27.120 --> 03:30.039
Mihajlo.
Come on, get a move on.

03:57.480 --> 03:59.839
- I'm going to the airport.
- New suit, eh?

03:59.960 --> 04:03.879
But you forgot to shower.
I can smell the sex on you, man.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.239
- Will things be okay while I'm gone?
- Yes.

04:11.360 --> 04:15.599
His brother isn't home, but they'll
be sure to catch him, no problem.

04:36.480 --> 04:38.879
I was watching that. Turn it on.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.799
Mom's worried about you.

04:46.360 --> 04:47.879
So am I actually.

04:55.320 --> 04:57.959
You know the first time
I remember you crying?

04:59.360 --> 05:03.159
- Did I cry much?
- Hardly at all.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.799
You were in the football team.

05:05.880 --> 05:09.119
Dad wouldn't get you the shin pads
all the other boys had.

05:09.240 --> 05:11.879
So you stole them. We found them.

05:13.680 --> 05:17.199
You expected a bollocking,
instead Dad walked into the school,

05:17.320 --> 05:19.719
told your teacher
you couldn't play on the team,

05:19.840 --> 05:22.519
that you didn't deserve
to represent your school.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.119
It was simple for him:
black or white.

05:31.280 --> 05:34.159
You do the right thing
in order to avoid doing the wrong thing.

05:34.280 --> 05:35.839
And it's not simple for you?

05:39.160 --> 05:40.599
No, I have a problem.

05:44.640 --> 05:47.119
The second time you were crying
is when you left.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.319
Though we all cried.

05:51.920 --> 05:53.319
And the silence.

05:55.800 --> 05:58.799
We all talked in whispers
for weeks.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.799
Like a tragedy had happened.

06:01.760 --> 06:04.159
- Hadn't it?
- And then he died.

06:05.120 --> 06:08.559
Mokhtar kept getting pulled in.
You didn't come back.

06:08.680 --> 06:10.359
- And Mom?
- Wait, wait.

06:10.480 --> 06:13.999
You're saying Mokhtar was my fault?
I should have come back?

06:14.120 --> 06:17.279
- I was told to stay away, so I did.
- To punish a dead man.

06:17.400 --> 06:19.759
I wanted to come back and I did,
on my own terms.

06:19.880 --> 06:23.239
On a big horse with the entire police
department. Cock out. Ready.

06:31.160 --> 06:36.439
Dad was sure of himself.
Full of pride, self-righteous. Always.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.319
And it damaged people.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.279
You've got a bit of that.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.999
You think it makes you
the man you are. But it doesn't.

06:46.120 --> 06:48.799
You have a choice.
Be your own man.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.039
Can you turn the TV back on, please?

08:13.320 --> 08:15.999
She had tattooed on the left cheek
"Merry Christmas",

08:16.120 --> 08:22.039
on the right one "Happy new year".
Tell her I'll come by during holidays.

08:22.160 --> 08:23.719
By the way, we have the numbers.

08:24.520 --> 08:27.599
It was not easy, but there is
a number dialed over and over.

08:27.720 --> 08:28.919
I'll be right back.

08:37.920 --> 08:41.159
So, did the internal investigation
clear you of the Serb's death?

08:41.280 --> 08:44.799
- Any progress on the SIM cards stuff?
- We're getting there.

08:44.920 --> 08:49.159
- Yeah?
- Really. You can trust me.

08:49.280 --> 08:50.919
Yeah, sure.

09:22.440 --> 09:24.279
- Don't turn around.
- Fuck.

09:25.920 --> 09:27.359
Hello, brother.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.439
I'm in deep shit, and you know it.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.479
- What does Roman do for you?
- He gives us information.

09:44.560 --> 09:46.999
Like which flats we'll raid
in Les Agnettes?

09:48.240 --> 09:49.759
Son of a bitch.

09:52.040 --> 09:54.559
- How much do you pay him?
- We don't.

09:54.680 --> 09:56.759
What do you mean,
you don't pay him?

09:56.880 --> 10:00.959
Believe it or not.
He does it because he believes in us.

10:04.560 --> 10:08.679
One king, to rule them all.
A singular power that all can respect.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.359
He believes that with one man in charge
the bloodshed will stop.

10:11.480 --> 10:15.039
- Stop bullshitting me. Talk.
- It's the truth.

10:15.160 --> 10:16.919
It's out of control.

10:17.040 --> 10:20.079
My boss killed the Serb
with Roman's gun. Right in front of me.

10:20.200 --> 10:24.119
- Who, who is the caid?
- Manu Esposito.

10:24.240 --> 10:26.919
The son of a bitch would kill me
for giving you his name.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.119
You know people in other cities,
I don't know anyone.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.879
I just need to stay hidden.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.319
I'm cracking up,
you have to help me.

10:37.280 --> 10:40.199
You made your choices,
I made mine. I can't.

10:41.920 --> 10:45.599
I'm your fucking brother.
It counts for nothing?

10:48.360 --> 10:49.759
You're going to bawl?

10:50.920 --> 10:55.039
Listen. You're going to help me
bring Manu and Roman down.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.119
Then there's no reason to run.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.759
You have a chance to clean up
your life, brother.

11:00.520 --> 11:01.679
Now.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.919
Been a while
since you called me that.

11:08.640 --> 11:11.319
Manu Esposito. What does he need?

11:11.440 --> 11:13.679
What we all need
since the Serbs cut us off.

11:13.800 --> 11:14.679
What?

11:14.800 --> 11:17.919
- Guns.
- We can do guns.

11:19.800 --> 11:23.279
What's on your mind? A trap?

11:27.440 --> 11:31.359
Yes. We'll get Roman and Manu
at the same time.

11:35.440 --> 11:38.079
- Are you're in?
- For sure.

12:31.720 --> 12:32.839
Franck?

12:41.600 --> 12:44.479
- Still fucking that girl in evidence?
- Cut the crap.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.879
I'm engaged to her. What are you
saying? Fucking? Are you crazy?

12:48.000 --> 12:51.039
- Engaged? You're joking?
- No, I've already proposed.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.639
- I've heard weird things about her.
- Cut the crap.

12:56.760 --> 13:00.399
What did you hear?
Did I ever see you with a woman?

13:00.520 --> 13:02.399
You're calling me a virgin?

13:03.760 --> 13:06.879
- Seriously, I need a favor.
- What?

13:07.000 --> 13:10.239
I can't say,
it could get you in deep shit.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.959
It could also provide answers
on the Belairs case.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.439
What do you need?

13:34.560 --> 13:35.919
Hello, gentlemen.

13:41.840 --> 13:43.199
You don't recognize us?

13:47.200 --> 13:48.519
I'm sorry, no.

14:01.120 --> 14:02.639
You don't recognize us?

14:10.840 --> 14:12.079
The Rachedis.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.039
Is there somewhere private
we can talk?

14:26.560 --> 14:28.439
Why are you here?

14:28.560 --> 14:32.399
We want you back to the gun
business. We're stinging some guy.

14:33.360 --> 14:34.359
Who?

14:35.240 --> 14:37.999
Manu. Manu Esposito.

14:39.680 --> 14:40.719
Esposito.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.919
- I left the business six years ago.
- It'll be okay.

14:45.040 --> 14:48.119
You know him, he knows you.
You made the Serbian connection.

14:49.680 --> 14:55.359
They'll kill me. And they'll work out
who you are and kill you.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.199
No, thank you.

14:58.880 --> 15:01.639
Fine. Let's do it differently then.
You have no choice.

15:02.720 --> 15:06.759
Tell me you don't see his face
every fucking day. Say it.

15:08.320 --> 15:09.919
You killed my friend, motherfucker.

15:10.360 --> 15:14.599
Shoot me if you want, you little shit,
and I'll haunt the crap out of you.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.639
Go fuck yourselves.

15:17.480 --> 15:19.679
Fucking let me go, asshole.

15:25.720 --> 15:30.159
You're not taking him seriously.
Because I'm the law.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.199
You think you have a choice?

18:16.600 --> 18:18.439
Wait. Wait.

18:21.320 --> 18:23.279
- Yes?
- They've found me.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.799
Are you sure?

18:26.320 --> 18:28.559
I saw Milomir,
they've found me, Milan.

18:37.200 --> 18:38.919
Did you give the address to anyone?

18:43.760 --> 18:44.999
Only to Nina.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.319
Adnan...

18:50.120 --> 18:52.479
She said she might come.
What else could I do?

18:52.600 --> 18:54.159
Leave her there?
What do I do?

18:54.280 --> 18:56.319
Get moving, get out of there.

18:56.440 --> 19:00.159
- Move. You can do it.
- Milan...

19:00.280 --> 19:02.839
- I'm sorry, this is my fault.
- Milan.

20:53.880 --> 20:57.679
- Yes.
- Why didn't you pick up the phone?

20:57.800 --> 21:00.799
- I thought I'd found him.
- Did you?

21:01.840 --> 21:04.439
No. Say, what's going on?

21:04.560 --> 21:08.319
How fast can one get a hold
of a 100 millions euros?

21:39.520 --> 21:42.639
- Be careful with that.
- Thank you, Franck.

22:56.400 --> 22:59.039
- So did your boss bite?
- Have you got the guns?

23:01.240 --> 23:03.679
Five guns.
We tell him these are samples.

23:05.480 --> 23:08.559
- You rock, bro.
- So did he bite?

23:11.480 --> 23:14.319
- So did he bite, or what?
- It'll work, don't worry.

23:15.160 --> 23:16.919
Is he ready?

23:17.040 --> 23:18.199
Are you ready?

23:24.680 --> 23:25.959
Will you be alright?

23:26.720 --> 23:28.759
It'll work out, don't worry.

25:50.120 --> 25:53.439
- Shall we go to a restaurant tonight?
- Why?

25:53.560 --> 25:56.599
I'd like to buy you dinner to celebrate.

25:56.720 --> 26:00.159
The IGS, the case closed.
To make peace, you know.

26:07.280 --> 26:08.639
Listen...

26:10.880 --> 26:13.599
I know I need to learn
to work with you.

26:18.560 --> 26:19.519
Alright.

26:20.520 --> 26:23.039
- I'll see you later.
- Yes.

28:47.640 --> 28:49.239
Thank you, Milan.

29:00.200 --> 29:03.999
Zlatko can't grasp
the principles of The Panthers.

29:06.520 --> 29:07.999
He's seems incapable of it.

29:09.040 --> 29:11.479
He hasn't fought in the war,
like we have.

29:13.120 --> 29:14.799
That's not a good thing.

29:19.480 --> 29:21.319
They were the best.

29:21.440 --> 29:24.359
Do you know how often
they got Arkan out of jail?

29:25.400 --> 29:26.399
Three times.

29:28.280 --> 29:29.119
Three.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.559
Those were good times.

29:37.240 --> 29:38.799
We were The Tigers.

29:40.560 --> 29:41.999
Now we're The Panthers.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.999
We were not afraid of anything.

29:48.520 --> 29:53.719
What Zlatko wants to do is shit.
Shit.

29:57.080 --> 29:59.519
There aren't any real Panthers left.

30:02.680 --> 30:04.559
You were one once. You.

30:06.680 --> 30:09.999
And you still are.
The last one of us.

30:11.120 --> 30:13.439
And we?
We're like the walking dead.

30:16.120 --> 30:18.439
So why the hell did I save you then?

30:21.680 --> 30:23.559
Maybe because that's how you are.

30:25.480 --> 30:27.279
You've always been like that.

30:28.920 --> 30:29.879
Always.

30:31.480 --> 30:33.679
We're alike, you and I.

30:35.120 --> 30:38.199
Maybe we can still
win that battle, but...

30:40.880 --> 30:43.039
It's over for us. It's over.

30:45.920 --> 30:50.399
We are not alike.
I've always been your beast.

30:50.520 --> 30:53.519
Everything I've done,
I've done to survive.

30:53.640 --> 30:57.599
Maybe it's over for you.
Not for me.

32:19.600 --> 32:23.919
Did he follow you
because he thought you were friends?

32:24.040 --> 32:26.719
What does "friends" mean?
What's that supposed to be?

32:37.280 --> 32:38.759
He's bunked off!

32:44.720 --> 32:49.279
Adnan, listen! Everything has gone
tits-up. I'm picking you up, yeah?

32:58.240 --> 33:00.199
You should call Zlatko.

33:08.920 --> 33:11.959
- See that big guy over there?
- Yes.

33:13.400 --> 33:15.719
He is one of the directors
of the World Bank.

33:16.360 --> 33:18.159
And that one over there...

33:18.280 --> 33:20.359
- The Chinese man?
- Yeah.

33:21.360 --> 33:24.039
He owns the Cayman Islands.

33:24.920 --> 33:27.439
He's trying
to get into the natural gas business.

33:28.920 --> 33:32.239
- His women are all first class.
- Whores?

33:32.360 --> 33:34.839
Do you see the coloured wristbands?

33:37.480 --> 33:39.479
So does that make them whores?

33:39.600 --> 33:41.999
No, it just makes them
easier to identify.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.559
The rose ones are for VIPs only.

33:45.680 --> 33:50.239
The yellow ones are for special friends
and the blue means the hunt is on.

33:50.360 --> 33:54.639
I see, an organized society.
I could get used to that.

34:00.920 --> 34:03.959
They even keep an account
of how often they fuck.

34:06.160 --> 34:09.399
American and Chinese money,
German rules.

34:10.360 --> 34:13.319
And Germans love rules
more than their own mothers.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.919
I'm yellow and you are blue.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.159
It's Jamezdin.

34:26.600 --> 34:30.319
- Milan is still alive.
- Tell your boys to seize Adnan.

34:31.280 --> 34:33.359
Let's stay a while longer.

34:35.200 --> 34:36.919
Come, let's find one for you.

34:44.960 --> 34:47.479
Are you sweating?

34:47.600 --> 34:50.159
Can you promise me
I'm not going to die in there?

34:53.360 --> 34:55.399
You bet I'm sweating.

34:57.760 --> 34:59.999
He has it all planned.

35:00.880 --> 35:03.039
He's going to disarm Manu
and arrest Roman.

35:03.160 --> 35:05.879
Then we're going to disappear
into the night.

35:07.320 --> 35:09.959
Your brother's bullshit
is going to get us killed.

35:11.800 --> 35:13.599
Don't worry, I'll do it.

35:31.280 --> 35:34.679
One day my father
sat on a bankruptcy case.

35:35.560 --> 35:38.839
A guy who manufactured
washing machine parts.

35:41.360 --> 35:44.679
The biggest firm he supplied
went out of business.

35:45.920 --> 35:49.719
So he explains all this to my father,
and my father said:

35:50.480 --> 35:54.119
It's unfortunate
but I can't prevent the foreclosure.

35:54.240 --> 36:01.599
It was the early '70s. There were no
metal detectors in courts back then.

36:02.160 --> 36:06.279
So the guy stands up
in the court room, takes out a gun

36:07.000 --> 36:11.199
and shoots himself in the mouth,
in front of my father.

36:11.800 --> 36:12.759
Fuck.

36:17.280 --> 36:19.119
What's your point?

36:20.600 --> 36:24.439
I mean, my father was helpless,
but we can do something.

36:24.880 --> 36:26.199
Marseille is a shithole.

36:26.320 --> 36:29.559
Guys fight each other,
we go in and they fight us too.

36:29.680 --> 36:35.079
It only gets worse. More and more
guns, it's a kind of vicious cycle.

36:35.200 --> 36:40.239
If we want to break it, we have
to change our methods radically.

36:40.360 --> 36:41.959
I disagree.

36:42.080 --> 36:47.639
We need to enforce the law harder.
Make sure they break before we do.

36:48.440 --> 36:51.919
No, it's not a battle
of good against evil.

36:52.040 --> 36:55.719
It's a choice between bad
and not quite as bad.

36:55.840 --> 37:00.479
And how does bad
and not quite as bad work?

37:00.600 --> 37:03.199
Your peace offer, that touches me.

37:03.320 --> 37:07.879
But the war you want to wage will
produce many victims and few results.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.239
You don't have any strategy.
You didn't think it through.

37:11.360 --> 37:15.079
We need to encourage singular power.
Only one.

37:15.200 --> 37:19.439
One boss that we can all respect
and with whom we can talk.

37:21.520 --> 37:23.599
For that we need to work together.

37:29.160 --> 37:30.559
It's the station.

37:33.040 --> 37:33.959
Yes?

37:36.880 --> 37:37.799
Where?

37:39.640 --> 37:41.319
I'm with Roman.
We'll hurry.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.559
Guns exchange.

37:43.680 --> 37:46.119
We'll meet you there. Okay.

37:49.000 --> 37:49.959
Let's go.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.999
No. You go.
I've nothing to do there.

37:53.120 --> 37:56.359
I know justice isn't
all black and white.

37:57.040 --> 37:59.959
But what about that? We give up?

38:00.080 --> 38:03.079
- No, you go.
- I don't want to go by myself.

38:03.960 --> 38:05.439
I have had a few too many.

38:06.760 --> 38:08.319
Are you good to drive?

38:13.600 --> 38:15.039
Yes, I am.

38:16.640 --> 38:17.639
Thanks.

38:24.640 --> 38:27.879
This is Commissioner Rachedi.
Do we have an ETA on the commandos?

38:28.000 --> 38:29.719
Thirty minutes, Commissioner.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.319
It's only three of them.

39:48.680 --> 39:51.879
- We have to go.
- No, we wait. That's an order.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.879
- I'm going.
- Khalil. Fuck.

40:07.680 --> 40:09.399
Where are they from?

40:09.520 --> 40:11.839
- Does it matter?
- Of course it matters.

40:12.600 --> 40:13.519
Well?

40:18.520 --> 40:19.559
Serbia?

40:21.440 --> 40:22.799
Who is your contact?

40:24.520 --> 40:26.399
What are you looking at him for?

40:26.880 --> 40:28.799
If he told you I'm nervous,
he's right.

40:30.400 --> 40:33.919
They're police knock-offs. I was
tipped they wanted to destroy them.

40:34.040 --> 40:37.599
There are 200.
That's all I've got.

40:37.720 --> 40:39.799
If you want them,
I'll give you a good price.

40:46.160 --> 40:49.399
Don't move. Drop the weapons.
Don't move.

40:53.680 --> 40:54.639
Drop it.

40:54.760 --> 40:56.479
I don't understand, is he one of us?

40:56.600 --> 40:57.479
Us?

40:58.480 --> 41:00.679
- What do you mean 'us'?
- Let's calm down.

41:00.800 --> 41:04.679
Let's talk and sort this out,
so we can all go home.

41:04.800 --> 41:06.959
- Drop it.
- No. There's no way out.

41:16.600 --> 41:17.559
Fuck.

41:22.800 --> 41:23.759
Shit.

41:28.240 --> 41:29.199
Take the bag.

41:30.520 --> 41:33.439
Take the guns. Make them disappear.

41:34.760 --> 41:35.999
Hurry, hurry.

41:44.080 --> 41:45.079
Here.

42:34.840 --> 42:38.079
There is a lady
who wants to talk to Tom Kandle.

45:48.360 --> 45:51.559
- What happened?
- Roman.

45:51.680 --> 45:53.079
Is he dead?

45:55.720 --> 45:56.879
He did what he could.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.559
If I was part of anything,
I got into it for you.

45:59.720 --> 46:01.559
Don't worry, you're safe.

46:06.400 --> 46:07.879
We got them.

46:09.880 --> 46:11.599
We're almost there, Franck.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.639
It's the beginning of the end.

46:21.760 --> 46:23.239
I'm parked over there.

47:24.000 --> 47:28.159
- Milan, they're here.
- Hang in there, I'll be right there.

47:28.280 --> 47:32.799
I'm in this house that they've bombed,
Fürst-Milos-Straße, or what it's called.

47:33.400 --> 47:35.559
I'm coming,
I won't let you down.

47:59.840 --> 48:00.879
Fuck.

48:02.040 --> 48:05.839
- It wasn't supposed to go like that.
- I know.

48:08.880 --> 48:12.839
What can you do about it now?
We've done all we can.

48:14.360 --> 48:18.359
- Let's get you out of Marseille.
- No, that won't work.

48:20.040 --> 48:21.439
It will be okay.

48:23.120 --> 48:27.319
I've got friends outside the city.
I can deliver. Let me do it.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.519
Someone saw us together.

48:31.840 --> 48:33.559
Don't worry. They trust me.

48:33.680 --> 48:37.319
They made me acting head of PJ.
You have nothing to fear. You're safe.

48:37.440 --> 48:41.199
Didn't you hear me?
Someone saw us. You and me.

48:41.320 --> 48:44.519
You think they'll come after me?
Let them. Let them.

48:45.560 --> 48:49.599
When you arrived back in Marseille,
everyone wondered if I could be trusted.

48:49.720 --> 48:52.519
If I go,
it'll only confirm the worst.

48:52.640 --> 48:54.919
You, Mom, Samira,
they'll come for all of you.

48:55.040 --> 48:57.199
We get the family out
and then we prepare.

49:00.160 --> 49:01.239
For what?

49:04.320 --> 49:05.359
War.

49:07.080 --> 49:08.999
Listen, they're coming for us.
