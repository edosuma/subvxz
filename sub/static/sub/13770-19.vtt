00:14.807 --> 00:18.059
What do you mean?

00:14.807 --> 00:18.059
Does it play at all?

00:20.103 --> 00:21.146
Great.

00:21.188 --> 00:24.023
What, were you roughhousing

00:21.188 --> 00:24.023
in my bedroom?

you're even gonna come out here

MALCOLM:

01:15.158 --> 01:16.326
Stevie, come on.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.995
Jonas Salk would've

01:16.368 --> 01:17.995
solved this days ago.

01:18.037 --> 01:20.831
(labored breathing):

01:18.037 --> 01:20.831
He wasn't... working with...

01:20.873 --> 01:21.916
an idiot.

01:21.957 --> 01:23.584
You're calling  me  an idiot?

01:23.625 --> 01:24.793
You want to make

01:24.835 --> 01:26.503
a type-two-restriction

01:24.835 --> 01:26.503
enzyme in yeast

01:26.545 --> 01:27.713
without using any bacteria,

01:27.755 --> 01:29.130
and I'm the idiot?

01:29.172 --> 01:30.549
Yes...

01:30.591 --> 01:32.133
and yes.

01:32.175 --> 01:36.597
We have to... try  something.

01:36.638 --> 01:39.140
What do you think I've been

01:36.638 --> 01:39.140
doing for the last two weeks?

01:39.182 --> 01:40.768
When am I getting

01:39.182 --> 01:40.768
my room back?

01:40.809 --> 01:43.520
I can't work on my sexy-face

01:40.809 --> 01:43.520
out there in front of Mom.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.773
What are you guys

01:43.562 --> 01:45.773
doing in here anyway?

01:45.814 --> 01:48.525
Trying to create a new kind

01:45.814 --> 01:48.525
of restriction enzyme.

01:48.567 --> 01:50.151
What does it look like?

01:50.193 --> 01:52.153
You're messing up

01:50.193 --> 01:52.153
my room for that?

01:52.195 --> 01:53.238
This is important.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.406
Restriction enzymes

01:53.280 --> 01:54.406
are used

01:54.448 --> 01:56.075
for chromosome mapping,

01:56.116 --> 01:57.952
DNA testing, gene splicing.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.160
It's for a big

01:57.993 --> 01:59.160
national competition.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.454
If we win this,

02:00.495 --> 02:03.040
our paper will be published

02:00.495 --> 02:03.040
in a scientific journal.

02:03.082 --> 02:04.416
We'll probably be able

02:03.082 --> 02:04.416
to write our ticket

02:04.458 --> 02:06.043
to any college in the country.

02:06.794 --> 02:10.589
Then everyone... will pay.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.260
Only our incubator

02:12.800 --> 02:15.260
keeps breaking down.

02:15.302 --> 02:18.639
Plus, we're running low on agar,

02:15.302 --> 02:18.639
we're completely out of blood,

02:18.680 --> 02:20.181
our yeast keeps

02:18.680 --> 02:20.181
getting contaminated...

02:20.223 --> 02:21.516
Maybe I can help.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.560
That's okay, Reese.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.771
If we need a head caught

02:23.602 --> 02:25.771
in a wastepaper basket,

02:25.813 --> 02:27.106
we'll give you a call.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.024
Why do you do that?

02:29.066 --> 02:30.776
I offered to help you,

02:29.066 --> 02:30.776
and you turn it around

02:30.818 --> 02:33.153
and make it about

02:30.818 --> 02:33.153
me being stupid.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.238
Seriously.

02:35.280 --> 02:37.157
I might have something

02:35.280 --> 02:37.157
to contribute.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.701
Why don't you just

02:38.241 --> 02:39.701
give me a chance?

02:44.539 --> 02:47.126
That's two pints.

02:44.539 --> 02:47.126
We'd better not take any more.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.710
This is so exciting.

02:48.752 --> 02:51.212
I feel like I'm going to faint!

02:52.756 --> 02:54.299
Four dollars, right?

02:54.341 --> 02:56.969
Thanks. Say hi

02:54.341 --> 02:56.969
to Dewey for me.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.847
Who was that?

02:59.888 --> 03:02.141
Oh, some kid from Dewey's class

02:59.888 --> 03:02.141
selling chocolate.

03:02.891 --> 03:03.934
Enjoy your strained beets,

03:03.976 --> 03:05.184
little man.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.314
Is it that time of year again?

03:09.356 --> 03:11.232
Mom, please don't make me.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.234
Aha! I wondered

03:11.274 --> 03:13.234
what you were doing

03:13.276 --> 03:15.154
with a book bag.

03:15.194 --> 03:18.032
I don't want to go

03:15.194 --> 03:18.032
door-to-door selling

03:15.194 --> 03:18.032
stupid candy.

03:18.073 --> 03:20.325
Dewey, your father and I

03:18.073 --> 03:20.325
have missed everything

03:18.073 --> 03:20.325
at school this year--

03:20.367 --> 03:22.410
the paper drive, the car wash,

03:20.367 --> 03:22.410
the bake sale.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.454
We need  you

03:22.452 --> 03:24.454
to pick up the slack.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.040
You are doing this.

03:26.081 --> 03:28.000
Dad, do I have to?

04:01.324 --> 04:03.243
DEWEY:

04:01.324 --> 04:03.243
Dad?

04:04.119 --> 04:05.286
Of course you're doing it.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.287
It'll be great

04:06.329 --> 04:07.581
for your character to sell--

04:07.622 --> 04:09.124
oh, what's a good number--

04:09.166 --> 04:11.085
275 bars.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.961
Looks like there's

04:11.126 --> 04:12.961
about another half hour

04:13.003 --> 04:15.172
of sunlight left--

04:13.003 --> 04:15.172
what are you waiting for?

04:15.214 --> 04:16.506
Fine, I'll do it!

04:16.548 --> 04:18.299
But I just want

04:16.548 --> 04:18.299
you to know,

04:18.341 --> 04:21.469
if some crazy couple

04:18.341 --> 04:21.469
steals me and then

04:18.341 --> 04:21.469
raises me as a girl,

04:21.511 --> 04:22.888
it's on your head.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.098
No, it's not.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.390
(groans)

04:25.432 --> 04:26.558
Hello?

04:26.600 --> 04:27.976
Hey, Dewey. What's going on?

04:28.018 --> 04:30.311
You won't believe

04:28.018 --> 04:30.311
what Mom's putting me through.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.479
What is it this time?

04:31.521 --> 04:33.732
They're doing a candy bar drive

04:31.521 --> 04:33.732
at school,

04:33.774 --> 04:36.484
and we've all been given

04:33.774 --> 04:36.484
a ton of candy bars to sell.

04:36.526 --> 04:37.986
Oh, I used to hate that.

04:38.028 --> 04:40.697
And you know what Mom did?

04:38.028 --> 04:40.697
What?

04:40.739 --> 04:42.657
She forbid me to sell them.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.035
She said I'd never be able

04:45.077 --> 04:46.327
to sell a single one.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.329
Oh, she did?

04:48.371 --> 04:49.414
That is horrible!

04:49.456 --> 04:51.125
I'll buy a dozen

04:49.456 --> 04:51.125
right now, Dewey.

04:51.166 --> 04:54.544
She even compared me selling

04:51.166 --> 04:54.544
candy to you getting married.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.337
You know what?

04:54.586 --> 04:56.337
Make it two dozen.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.423
But don't tell Mom--

04:56.379 --> 04:58.423
she'll think I did it

04:58.465 --> 04:59.633
just to make her mad.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.426
Tell her someone else

04:59.674 --> 05:01.426
bought them.

05:01.468 --> 05:02.552
Wouldn't that be a lie?

05:02.594 --> 05:03.720
It doesn't matter.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.346
It's justified--

05:03.762 --> 05:05.346
she's the reason

05:05.388 --> 05:07.348
that no one in this family

05:05.388 --> 05:07.348
has any confidence.

05:07.390 --> 05:10.269
I'm hanging up right now

05:07.390 --> 05:10.269
so I can write you a check.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.606
Hey, Fred, where are you

05:12.437 --> 05:14.606
going with that piglet?

05:14.648 --> 05:17.358
Well, can't keep him in the pen.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.358
The sow rejected him.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.360
So you're gonna take him home?

05:19.402 --> 05:22.030
Yeah, that's what

05:19.402 --> 05:22.030
I'm gonna do.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.199
Oh, no!

05:24.241 --> 05:25.366
Do you have to?

05:25.408 --> 05:26.785
Well, listen, he's half the size

05:26.827 --> 05:28.162
of the rest of the litter.

05:28.203 --> 05:29.955
The other piglets

05:28.203 --> 05:29.955
won't let him feed.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.372
It's the humane thing to do.

05:31.414 --> 05:34.168
Fred, you can't do this.

05:31.414 --> 05:34.168
Look at his face.

05:34.209 --> 05:36.419
He knows you're gonna

05:34.209 --> 05:36.419
take him out and kill him.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.379
Well, he does  now.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.381
Ralph!

05:38.421 --> 05:40.381
What?

05:40.423 --> 05:41.967
You can't kill him

05:40.423 --> 05:41.967
if he has a name.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.385
It's Ralph.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.385
Little Ralph the piglet.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.763
Aw, geez.

05:46.805 --> 05:50.391
That's my kid's name. Here.

05:50.433 --> 05:54.229
(grunting softly)

05:50.433 --> 05:54.229
(sighs)

05:57.440 --> 06:00.110
(timer ticking)

06:00.152 --> 06:01.569
(bell dings)

06:01.611 --> 06:03.322
Did it separate?

06:03.362 --> 06:04.281
Hell, no.

06:04.323 --> 06:06.908
So we still don't have

06:04.323 --> 06:06.908
an enzyme.

06:06.950 --> 06:08.409
What is our problem?

06:08.451 --> 06:09.494
We've tried...

06:09.536 --> 06:11.121
every variable...

06:11.163 --> 06:13.414
of heat... and pressure?

06:13.456 --> 06:14.833
Yes, yes, yes.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.793
We've tried acids,

06:14.875 --> 06:16.793
we've tried bases.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.461
How much blood

06:16.835 --> 06:18.461
do we have left?

06:18.503 --> 06:19.796
Plenty.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.422
I snuck...

06:21.464 --> 06:24.425
another pint...

06:21.464 --> 06:24.425
when he was sleeping.

06:24.467 --> 06:27.304
Stevie!

06:24.467 --> 06:27.304
He wants... to help.

06:27.346 --> 06:28.638
I know, but I took care of that.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.225
He kept bugging me,

06:28.680 --> 06:31.225
so I gave him some food coloring

06:31.266 --> 06:32.517
and told him

06:31.266 --> 06:32.517
they were chemicals.

06:32.559 --> 06:34.936
Guys, guys!

06:32.559 --> 06:34.936
I've made a discovery!

06:34.978 --> 06:39.440
When you mix blue and yellow,

06:34.978 --> 06:39.440
you get an entirely new color!

06:39.482 --> 06:41.235
I'm gonna name it...

06:41.276 --> 06:43.278
"blellow."

06:46.365 --> 06:47.490
Hey, look at this.

06:47.532 --> 06:50.493
Dewey has already

06:47.532 --> 06:50.493
sold 52 candy bars.

06:50.535 --> 06:52.537
He still has

06:50.535 --> 06:52.537
a long way to go, Lois.

06:52.579 --> 06:55.332
Let's keep our feet

06:52.579 --> 06:55.332
on the ground.

06:56.415 --> 06:58.752
For now.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.796
Kitty, come down.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.426
Fear not!

07:07.969 --> 07:09.470
(meows)

07:11.514 --> 07:12.557
(meows)

07:12.599 --> 07:15.435
Have your pets

07:12.599 --> 07:15.435
spayed or neutered.

07:18.605 --> 07:21.566
It's nice Dewey's working

07:18.605 --> 07:21.566
so hard for the school.

07:21.608 --> 07:25.904
If he keeps this up,

07:21.608 --> 07:25.904
we'll be able to blow

07:21.608 --> 07:25.904
off the Safety Fair.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.324
(doorbell rings)

07:29.366 --> 07:31.492
Hello, sir.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.161
Sorry. I don't eat candy.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.122
Oh, these aren't candy bars.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.581
These are America Bars.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.541
What are you talking about?

07:38.583 --> 07:40.752
You know, America Bars.

07:40.794 --> 07:44.214
Well, actually, I prefer

07:40.794 --> 07:44.214
the term "Freedom Bars."

07:44.256 --> 07:46.216
You love America, right?

07:46.258 --> 07:47.426
Well, of course I do.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.303
Well, there are

07:47.467 --> 07:49.303
a lot of people out there

07:49.344 --> 07:51.596
who are hoping

07:49.344 --> 07:51.596
we won't do our part.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.555
What do you mean?

07:52.597 --> 07:55.100
You know. People.

07:52.597 --> 07:55.100
People who don't have

07:55.142 --> 07:57.518
this country's best interests

07:55.142 --> 07:57.518
at heart.

07:57.560 --> 08:01.398
So, these candy bars

07:57.560 --> 08:01.398
help fight terrorism?

08:01.440 --> 08:05.026
With every chocolatey,

08:01.440 --> 08:05.026
nougaty bite.

08:05.068 --> 08:05.902
How much are they?

08:05.944 --> 08:08.029
$9.50.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.114
I'll take two.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.031
Thank you.

08:10.073 --> 08:11.950
No, young man. Thank  you.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.330
(seething breaths)

08:16.371 --> 08:19.166
Separate!

08:21.584 --> 08:22.710
Hello...

08:22.752 --> 08:24.754
trade school.

08:25.588 --> 08:27.548
I wish Reggie would kill Archie

08:27.590 --> 08:29.050
and take over this comic.

08:29.092 --> 08:31.052
Malcolm, I need you

08:29.092 --> 08:31.052
to watch Jamie for a while.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.805
Mom, we're at a very critical

08:31.094 --> 08:33.805
point in our experiment.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.765
I'm sorry. Are you new?

08:35.807 --> 08:38.685
Stevie, explain to

08:35.807 --> 08:38.685
your friend how things

08:35.807 --> 08:38.685
work around here.

08:42.981 --> 08:45.400
(happy gurgling)

08:48.236 --> 08:50.155
Anything?

08:50.197 --> 08:51.865
No change.

08:51.906 --> 08:54.575
Bounce him higher.

08:54.617 --> 08:57.412
Well, none of  these  worked.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.080
Maybe we should...

09:02.250 --> 09:04.044
Oh, my God!

09:04.085 --> 09:07.755
(labored breathing):

09:04.085 --> 09:07.755
It... separated!

09:07.797 --> 09:09.674
Yeah! We did it!

09:09.716 --> 09:10.758
We made an enzyme!

09:10.800 --> 09:11.759
Unbelievable!

09:11.801 --> 09:12.802
What'd you do to it?

09:12.844 --> 09:15.805
I didn't... do anything.

09:15.847 --> 09:20.060
What? Well, neither did I.

09:27.650 --> 09:28.609
(gasps)

09:28.651 --> 09:30.028
Blellow!

09:30.737 --> 09:33.573
Hey, guys.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.462
How did... you do it?

09:47.504 --> 09:48.629
I didn't do anything.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.216
Look, we're not

09:48.671 --> 09:51.216
mad at you.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.633
We just need to know

09:51.258 --> 09:52.633
what you did.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.094
Why are you always

09:52.675 --> 09:54.094
blaming me?

09:54.135 --> 09:56.054
Reese, you did a good thing.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.473
You somehow got this thing

09:56.096 --> 09:58.473
to separate.

09:58.515 --> 09:59.640
You must have added something.

09:59.682 --> 10:00.850
What was it?

10:00.892 --> 10:02.727
Oh.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.688
I just... I don't know

10:02.769 --> 10:05.688
if I can even remember.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.690
I mean, I wasn't paying

10:05.730 --> 10:07.690
that much attention,

10:07.732 --> 10:09.650
and there was all this

10:07.732 --> 10:09.650
other stuff going on.

10:09.692 --> 10:11.152
And I'm not sure

10:09.692 --> 10:11.152
why I'd tell you...

10:11.194 --> 10:13.238
if you're not going

10:11.194 --> 10:13.238
to give me credit!

10:13.280 --> 10:14.114
What?

10:14.155 --> 10:15.490
This is a big contest.

10:15.532 --> 10:16.950
Big enough for

10:15.532 --> 10:16.950
the three of us.

10:16.991 --> 10:19.660
So, either we split

10:16.991 --> 10:19.660
the credit three ways,

10:19.702 --> 10:21.455
or I'm not talking.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.664
You are picking

10:23.706 --> 10:26.460
the wrong guys

10:23.706 --> 10:26.460
to mess with, Reese.

10:26.501 --> 10:28.253
Yeah.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.588
Let's tattle.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.047
...and he won't tell us

10:29.629 --> 10:31.047
what he did

10:31.089 --> 10:32.673
unless we give him credit

10:31.089 --> 10:32.673
for it.

10:32.715 --> 10:33.841
It's so unfair.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.676
All he did was just

10:33.883 --> 10:35.676
read comic books

10:35.718 --> 10:37.512
and we've been working on it

10:35.718 --> 10:37.512
for weeks.

10:37.554 --> 10:38.846
What is it you want me

10:37.554 --> 10:38.846
to do, Malcolm?

10:38.888 --> 10:39.889
Force him to tell us.

10:39.931 --> 10:40.932
Wait a minute.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.268
It seems to me if Reese

10:40.974 --> 10:43.268
fixed your experiment,

10:43.310 --> 10:44.519
he should get some credit.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.146
What? No.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.981
He doesn't even know

10:46.187 --> 10:47.981
why it works.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.191
I've been working for 20 years

10:48.022 --> 10:50.191
without knowing why.

10:50.233 --> 10:52.360
Give Reese the credit.

10:53.736 --> 10:54.779
(pig squeals)

10:54.821 --> 10:56.114
Calm down, Ralph, it's okay.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.698
You're all right.

10:58.741 --> 10:59.700
What happened?

10:59.742 --> 11:01.286
The other piglets

10:59.742 --> 11:01.286
were mean to him.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.703
Francis, you said last week

11:02.745 --> 11:04.331
you'd put that thing

11:02.745 --> 11:04.331
back in its pen.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.707
I tried, but he's just

11:04.372 --> 11:06.707
so good-natured and sweet,

11:06.749 --> 11:08.001
the others won't let him feed.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.628
I am not putting him

11:08.042 --> 11:09.628
back in there

11:09.669 --> 11:11.296
until I teach him

11:09.669 --> 11:11.296
to be more assertive.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.924
But we're spending

11:11.338 --> 11:14.924
every second of the day

11:11.338 --> 11:14.924
taking care of him.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.884
Hey, no one ever said

11:14.966 --> 11:16.884
raising a pig would be easy.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.720
No one ever said

11:16.926 --> 11:19.720
we'd be raising a pig.

11:19.762 --> 11:20.930
Listen, Francis...

11:20.972 --> 11:23.224
either you return Ralph

11:20.972 --> 11:23.224
to his pen tonight,

11:23.266 --> 11:26.144
or he's gonna be looking up

11:23.266 --> 11:26.144
at you from an omelet.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.105
Come on, Ralph.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.731
(grunts)

11:30.773 --> 11:31.816
It's gut-check time.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.734
Your brothers don't think

11:31.858 --> 11:33.734
you can keep up with them.

11:33.776 --> 11:34.735
Is that what you think?

11:34.777 --> 11:36.363
Come on, I know you can do it.

11:36.404 --> 11:37.989
You just gotta get tough.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.699
Come on, show me your mean face.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.667
(sighs)

11:50.377 --> 11:52.795
(low humming)

11:52.837 --> 11:54.713
(bell dings)

11:57.967 --> 11:59.177
(sighs)

11:59.219 --> 12:01.471
Hmm. What's that?

12:01.513 --> 12:02.763
(sniffs deeply)

12:02.805 --> 12:05.350
Ah. The stink of failure.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.601
Okay, Reese. We give up.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.811
Just tell us what you did

12:06.643 --> 12:08.811
and we'll give you credit.

12:08.853 --> 12:11.481
Okay, just sign this.

12:13.692 --> 12:16.653
"Reese is a full partner

12:13.692 --> 12:16.653
in this experiment

12:16.695 --> 12:18.779
"and is entitled to

12:16.695 --> 12:18.779
a full share of the credit

12:18.821 --> 12:20.448
"because without his help,

12:20.490 --> 12:22.617
this would have

12:20.490 --> 12:22.617
been impossible."

12:28.831 --> 12:30.791
Outwitted...

12:30.833 --> 12:32.751
by a dumb ass.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.838
Everything seems to be in order.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.007
All right, Reese,

12:35.880 --> 12:38.007
tell us what you did.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.427
Okay.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.220
I have no idea.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.305
I don't remember doing

12:42.262 --> 12:44.305
anything special to it.

12:44.347 --> 12:45.848
What?!

12:44.347 --> 12:45.848
But now when you

12:45.890 --> 12:47.601
make fun of me

12:45.890 --> 12:47.601
and tell people I'm stupid,

12:47.642 --> 12:49.269
I have actual evidence

12:47.642 --> 12:49.269
in your own handwriting

12:49.310 --> 12:51.812
that says

12:49.310 --> 12:51.812
I'm just as smart as you are.

12:51.854 --> 12:54.773
Hah! Finally,

12:51.854 --> 12:54.773
there is justice in...

12:55.858 --> 13:00.530
This baby's mother

12:55.858 --> 13:00.530
is 13 years old.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.283
Every candy bar you buy

13:03.324 --> 13:06.620
goes towards buying

13:03.324 --> 13:06.620
unwed mothers like her

13:06.661 --> 13:09.205
schoolbooks and hot lunches.

13:09.247 --> 13:11.165
I'll get my purse.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.461
(Reese groans)

13:14.502 --> 13:16.879
I'm telling you

13:14.502 --> 13:16.879
I don't remember!

13:16.921 --> 13:18.839
Okay, let him up.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.258
(click)

13:18.881 --> 13:20.258
(Reese screams)

13:21.884 --> 13:23.470
Reese...

13:23.511 --> 13:24.845
this is important.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.013
It's for medicine.

13:26.055 --> 13:29.350
This enzyme could help save

13:26.055 --> 13:29.350
somebody's life one day.

13:29.392 --> 13:32.061
Just please try to think

13:29.392 --> 13:32.061
about what you did.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.315
Um...

13:36.399 --> 13:38.151
I can't.

13:36.399 --> 13:38.151
I'm sorry.

13:38.192 --> 13:39.860
I don't know.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.488
I was just hanging out

13:39.902 --> 13:41.488
in the room like I always do.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.864
Re... create it.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.575
Yeah,

13:43.906 --> 13:45.575
that's a great idea.

13:45.617 --> 13:46.660
Just do everything

13:45.617 --> 13:46.660
you did

13:46.701 --> 13:48.161
when you were

13:46.701 --> 13:48.161
in the room by yourself.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.871
Just close your eyes

13:48.202 --> 13:50.871
and pretend.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.873
See everything you did

13:50.913 --> 13:52.873
in your mind's eye

13:52.915 --> 13:54.668
and then just

13:52.915 --> 13:54.668
do what you see.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.253
Stevie and I

13:54.709 --> 13:57.253
aren't even here.

13:57.295 --> 14:00.381
You're alone in the room

13:57.295 --> 14:00.381
just like before.

14:00.423 --> 14:03.301
Okay, let's see...

14:05.136 --> 14:06.513
First thing was...

14:06.554 --> 14:08.181
you guys left.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.976
And then I went

14:09.223 --> 14:11.976
to the test tubes...

14:13.102 --> 14:14.270
...to see what

14:13.102 --> 14:14.270
an enzyme tasted like.

14:14.312 --> 14:15.522
(cork pops)

14:16.981 --> 14:18.899
But then it was boring already.

14:20.985 --> 14:25.323
And then...

14:20.985 --> 14:25.323
I saw something shiny...

14:28.868 --> 14:30.911
...and I put it

14:28.868 --> 14:30.911
in my "shiny" box.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.956
And then...

14:35.249 --> 14:36.543
Right.

14:39.170 --> 14:41.922
And then I got

14:39.170 --> 14:41.922
one of Malcolm's shirts...

14:41.964 --> 14:43.550
and then I...

14:58.981 --> 15:00.608
Oh, my God.

15:00.650 --> 15:04.571
Then I played

15:00.650 --> 15:04.571
with Dewey's Game Boy.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.156
And your teacher

15:05.988 --> 15:07.156
called to say

15:07.198 --> 15:08.949
you sold more chocolate

15:07.198 --> 15:08.949
bars than anyone else.

15:08.991 --> 15:10.159
She said all your

15:08.991 --> 15:10.159
classmates hate you.

15:10.201 --> 15:12.245
I'm so proud, Dewey.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.372
Well, you know,

15:12.286 --> 15:14.372
it's a good product.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.998
They really

15:14.414 --> 15:15.998
sell themselves.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.166
I can't believe it.

15:17.208 --> 15:20.002
Dewey sold over

15:17.208 --> 15:20.002
1,500 candy bars.

15:21.087 --> 15:23.214
1,500...

15:23.256 --> 15:26.509
Page 12.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.937
(engine revving,

15:35.184 --> 15:37.937
tires squealing)

15:51.868 --> 15:53.994
They'll eat your

15:51.868 --> 15:53.994
dad's dust.

15:54.036 --> 15:56.330
(doorbell rings)

15:57.874 --> 15:59.208
Hi.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.252
Is this where the boy lives

15:59.250 --> 16:01.252
who's selling Eco-Bars?

16:01.294 --> 16:03.797
Sorry, we're all out.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.797
Come back later.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.632
Well, there you are.

16:03.838 --> 16:05.632
We wanted to buy some more

16:05.673 --> 16:07.258
of those candy bars

16:05.673 --> 16:07.258
that heal the forests.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.719
You should be

16:07.300 --> 16:09.719
so proud of your boy.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.011
I don't know what

16:09.761 --> 16:11.011
you're talking about.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.012
Of course you do.

16:12.054 --> 16:14.014
You said every bar

16:12.054 --> 16:14.014
plants a seedling

16:14.056 --> 16:15.725
in fire-ravaged

16:14.056 --> 16:15.725
Yellowstone.

16:15.767 --> 16:17.811
Ooh, and I love

16:15.767 --> 16:17.811
the little bonus

16:17.852 --> 16:19.813
of 10% going

16:17.852 --> 16:19.813
to pro-life causes.

16:19.854 --> 16:20.980
Wait a minute.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.524
He told me 10%

16:21.021 --> 16:23.524
went to pro-choice causes.

16:23.566 --> 16:26.026
I didn't know

16:23.566 --> 16:26.026
you felt that way.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.987
I didn't know you

16:26.068 --> 16:27.987
felt  that  way.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.114
Excuse me, ladies,

16:30.156 --> 16:32.032
I have to tell someone

16:30.156 --> 16:32.032
how I feel.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.286
You are in

16:35.328 --> 16:36.537
so much trouble.

16:36.579 --> 16:38.038
I hope you'll think

16:36.579 --> 16:38.038
about what you did

16:38.080 --> 16:41.041
every time you see me

16:38.080 --> 16:41.041
driving by in your prize.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.460
He's not getting

16:41.083 --> 16:42.460
any prize.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.544
You've been lying

16:43.586 --> 16:45.546
to everyone

16:43.586 --> 16:45.546
to get them to buy candy?

16:45.588 --> 16:47.047
What did we tell

16:45.588 --> 16:47.047
you about lying?

16:47.089 --> 16:48.967
Lying is the worst thing

16:47.089 --> 16:48.967
you can do.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.051
It destroys character,

16:49.008 --> 16:51.051
Dewey.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.137
It destroys the trust

16:51.093 --> 16:53.137
people have in each other.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.472
Do you understand?

16:54.514 --> 16:55.890
Yes.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.224
What do you have

16:55.932 --> 16:57.224
to say for yourself?

16:57.266 --> 16:59.560
Francis told me to do it.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.270
I should have known.

17:01.312 --> 17:04.064
Did you tell your brother

17:01.312 --> 17:04.064
to lie about those candy bars?

17:04.106 --> 17:05.692
You bet I did.

17:05.733 --> 17:06.693
And I'm sick of you

17:06.734 --> 17:08.068
standing on the sidelines

17:08.110 --> 17:09.904
sabotaging everything

17:08.110 --> 17:09.904
we try to do.

17:09.946 --> 17:12.072
Have you lost your mind,

17:09.946 --> 17:12.072
Francis?

17:12.114 --> 17:14.074
What kind of advice is that

17:12.114 --> 17:14.074
to give to your brother?

17:14.116 --> 17:15.075
This is all your fault.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.327
I'm just trying

17:16.369 --> 17:17.495
to help the kid

17:17.537 --> 17:19.163
instead of tearing

17:17.537 --> 17:19.163
him down all the time.

17:19.205 --> 17:20.498
And I'm sick of you thinking

17:20.540 --> 17:22.333
that everything we do

17:20.540 --> 17:22.333
is stupid.

17:27.338 --> 17:29.590
Okay, Ralph, remember

17:27.338 --> 17:29.590
your visualization.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.091
You're mean, you're tough.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.385
You're the biggest

17:31.133 --> 17:32.385
pig in the pen

17:32.426 --> 17:33.970
and you're not

17:32.426 --> 17:33.970
afraid of anyone.

17:34.012 --> 17:36.096
Get in there, kick some ass

17:36.138 --> 17:39.809
and nurse like you have

17:36.138 --> 17:39.809
never nursed before.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.104
Hey, that's it, Ralph.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.106
Get in there. Good for you.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.316
Good.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.316
(squealing)

17:47.358 --> 17:49.027
Okay, stop, Ralph.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.737
Ralph, no biting.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.780
Oh, not the mother, too!

17:52.822 --> 17:54.281
(squealing)

17:52.822 --> 17:54.281
(screams)

17:54.323 --> 17:56.868
That's gross.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.868
(grunting, running hoofbeats)

17:59.161 --> 18:00.621
No, Ralph, not the...

18:00.663 --> 18:03.249
chicken coop.

18:00.663 --> 18:03.249
(chickens clucking)

18:04.876 --> 18:08.128
If I were you, I'd hurry up

18:04.876 --> 18:08.128
and start naming the cattle.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.589
(cow mooing)

18:09.630 --> 18:11.131
...and then my ears

18:11.173 --> 18:13.133
were finally

18:11.173 --> 18:13.133
clean.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.510
Then I was going

18:13.175 --> 18:14.510
to update

18:14.552 --> 18:16.136
my enemies list,

18:16.178 --> 18:18.472
but I remembered I

18:16.178 --> 18:18.472
had math homework.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.562
Didn't get it.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.231
Didn't get it.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.025
Didn't get it.

18:29.067 --> 18:32.820
Stupid. Stupid.

18:32.862 --> 18:36.282
Stupid.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.159
Stupid.

18:39.201 --> 18:42.789
I hate you, I hate you.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.632
Then I worked

18:50.588 --> 18:52.632
on my triceps.

18:57.261 --> 19:00.848
Hey, no one likes math.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.144
Sorry.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.188
That's okay.

19:09.732 --> 19:12.652
So, what'd

19:09.732 --> 19:12.652
you do next?

19:12.693 --> 19:13.486
Nothing.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.404
I started playing

19:13.527 --> 19:15.404
with the ball.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.663
Well, I guess we won't...

19:23.704 --> 19:25.414
Throw it... again.

19:25.456 --> 19:26.624
What?

19:26.666 --> 19:28.501
Reese, keep throwing it.

19:36.134 --> 19:37.635
Look.

19:41.472 --> 19:42.723
It separated.

19:42.765 --> 19:44.851
It separated!

19:44.892 --> 19:46.226
There must be asbestos

19:44.892 --> 19:46.226
in the ceiling.

19:46.268 --> 19:47.728
Of course.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.897
What are you talking about?

19:47.770 --> 19:49.897
Reese, you did it.

19:49.939 --> 19:52.232
Asbestos is a highly

19:49.939 --> 19:52.232
mutagenic material.

19:52.274 --> 19:55.486
It can change the way cells

19:52.274 --> 19:55.486
reproduce-- these cells.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.237
And it's been here

19:55.528 --> 19:57.237
the whole time.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.698
We have asbestos

19:57.279 --> 19:58.698
in our ceiling.

19:58.739 --> 20:01.241
ALL:

19:58.739 --> 20:01.241
We have asbestos in our ceiling.

20:01.283 --> 20:02.910
We have asbestos

20:01.283 --> 20:02.910
in our ceiling.

20:05.287 --> 20:06.288
Yay.

20:06.330 --> 20:09.249
What?

20:14.172 --> 20:15.882
LOIS:

20:14.172 --> 20:15.882
Scrabbled eggs,

20:14.172 --> 20:15.882
coming up.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.304
So we're living out here

20:22.346 --> 20:24.431
till they get

20:22.346 --> 20:24.431
the asbestos cleaned out.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.766
Oh, and we won the contest.

20:25.808 --> 20:27.768
Turns out the company

20:25.808 --> 20:27.768
sponsoring it

20:27.810 --> 20:29.269
keeps all the patent rights.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.689
They're using our work

20:29.311 --> 20:31.689
to make a new cholesterol drug

20:31.731 --> 20:33.273
that'll earn billions.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.483
And you know what we got?

20:34.525 --> 20:36.443
A pencil case.

20:36.485 --> 20:38.237
It has a compass in it.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.324
Mom, Dad, anybody

20:40.406 --> 20:42.324
need a pencil?

20:42.366 --> 20:44.744
No, Reese.

20:42.366 --> 20:44.744
We still don't need a pencil.

20:44.785 --> 20:48.288
Well, if you do, you

20:44.785 --> 20:48.288
know where to find it.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.208
Okay, Francis, how

20:48.330 --> 20:50.208
much longer are we

20:50.249 --> 20:52.376
going to have to share

20:50.249 --> 20:52.376
the bed with Ralph?

20:52.418 --> 20:54.294
It's getting

20:52.418 --> 20:54.294
ridiculous.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.130
He puts up

20:54.336 --> 20:56.130
a brave front,

20:56.172 --> 20:58.841
but I don't think he really

20:56.172 --> 20:58.841
feels that confident.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.681
He'll let us know

21:04.097 --> 21:05.681
when he's ready.
