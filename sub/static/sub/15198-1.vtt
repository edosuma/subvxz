WEBVTT

00:21.255 --> 00:23.989
Man: In September of 1864,

00:23.991 --> 00:25.390
a group of representatives

00:25.392 --> 00:27.392
from the colonies
of British North America

00:27.394 --> 00:28.659
arrived on a steamship

00:28.661 --> 00:30.794
in Charlottetown,
Prince Edward Island,

00:30.796 --> 00:33.396
to discuss
a ground-breaking idea.

00:33.398 --> 00:35.998
Their goal:
to unite the Maritime Union

00:36.000 --> 00:38.800
with the then-named
Province of Canada.

00:38.802 --> 00:40.401
Unfortunately for the men,

00:40.403 --> 00:42.803
a circus was in town
at the same time,

00:42.805 --> 00:45.005
which the public found
much more interesting,

00:45.007 --> 00:47.007
so there was no one
working at the docks

00:47.009 --> 00:49.809
and the men's ship
remained at sea.

00:49.811 --> 00:52.211
Humiliated,
the only official agreement

00:52.213 --> 00:53.812
to come from this meeting,

00:53.814 --> 00:56.414
was that the men
would meet again.

00:56.416 --> 00:58.215
Another gathering
with the same agenda

00:58.217 --> 01:00.417
was held the next month
in Quebec.

01:00.419 --> 01:02.419
After lengthy negotiations,

01:02.421 --> 01:06.422
the men agreed to create
a single united country, Canada,

01:06.424 --> 01:08.657
and drafted
the British North America Act,

01:08.659 --> 01:11.226
later known
as Canada's Constitution.

01:11.228 --> 01:14.429
With winter keeping any more
distracting carnivals at bay,

01:14.431 --> 01:15.830
people across the land cheered

01:15.832 --> 01:18.032
over the creation
of their new country...

01:18.034 --> 01:19.833
which didn't officially
become a country

01:19.835 --> 01:21.067
until three years later,

01:21.069 --> 01:24.670
on July 1st 1867, Canada Day,

01:24.672 --> 01:26.371
when a bored Queen Victoria

01:26.373 --> 01:29.240
accidentally noticed the
constitution on an end table,

01:29.242 --> 01:31.842
and reluctantly
signed it into law.

01:31.844 --> 01:34.678
The world's indifference
toward my homeland

01:34.680 --> 01:36.246
had officially begun.

01:39.851 --> 01:42.251
Man:
I was born a typical
Canadian child.

01:42.253 --> 01:43.685
Raised by a lumberjack,

01:43.687 --> 01:45.253
had hockey bed sheets...

01:45.255 --> 01:47.054
and went to school
with an Inuit boy

01:47.056 --> 01:48.622
named Roger Poontip.

01:48.624 --> 01:50.690
Who was ironically
the last guy in class

01:50.692 --> 01:52.258
to remain a virgin.

01:52.260 --> 01:53.859
I loved living in Canada.

01:53.861 --> 01:56.461
Specifically beautiful
Calgary, Alberta.

01:56.463 --> 01:58.262
With the Rockies on one side,

01:58.264 --> 01:59.863
prairies and rivers
on the other,

01:59.865 --> 02:01.698
I thought it was paradise.

02:01.700 --> 02:03.700
I was also an adventurous child.

02:03.702 --> 02:05.535
Like one winter when I was four,

02:05.537 --> 02:08.471
I thought I could jump a huge
rock on a hill on a toboggan.

02:08.473 --> 02:09.872
I could not.

02:09.874 --> 02:11.473
Or when I was in grade eight,

02:11.475 --> 02:12.807
I wanted to make a bomb

02:12.809 --> 02:14.275
like the ones I saw
in action movies

02:14.277 --> 02:15.609
and ended up blowing up

02:15.611 --> 02:17.477
my junior high school
long-jump pit,

02:17.479 --> 02:20.880
and almost my chances
at being allowed into Grade 9.

02:20.882 --> 02:23.082
A teacher there,
Mr. Macklemore,

02:23.084 --> 02:25.084
told me that I'd never
amount to anything,

02:25.086 --> 02:26.718
and the next time
I came back to the school

02:26.720 --> 02:28.286
would be as its janitor.

02:28.288 --> 02:30.488
More on him later.

02:30.490 --> 02:32.723
10 years later,
I had moved to L.A.

02:32.725 --> 02:35.292
and landed a job
as a TV sitcom writer.

02:35.294 --> 02:38.295
I was fortunate enough
to work on some great shows,

02:38.297 --> 02:40.096
some so-so shows,

02:40.098 --> 02:41.897
and "According To Jim".

02:41.899 --> 02:43.732
But on every show I worked on,

02:43.734 --> 02:46.501
I kept running into
the same strange problem.

02:46.503 --> 02:49.303
Once my fellow writers
found out I was Canadian,

02:49.305 --> 02:51.905
they'd immediately stare at me
like I was a freak,

02:51.907 --> 02:54.140
then make more lame
stereotypical comments

02:54.142 --> 02:55.674
about my homeland.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.742
So, I hear you're
from Canada.
Yeah...

02:57.744 --> 03:00.311
(Imitating Canadian accent)
How's it goin',<i> eh</i> ?

03:00.313 --> 03:01.945
(Chuckling)
Noo doot uboot it!

03:01.947 --> 03:03.513
(Laughing)

03:03.515 --> 03:06.749
This annoying issue also
continued wherever I travelled.

03:06.751 --> 03:09.518
In Kenya, these guys wondered
how I was so healthy,

03:09.520 --> 03:11.319
given Canada
couldn't grow vegetables

03:11.321 --> 03:13.321
under our permanent
layer of ice.

03:13.323 --> 03:15.122
The Italian man who snapped this

03:15.124 --> 03:16.623
worried the sun would melt me

03:16.625 --> 03:19.759
because Canadians
are all nice snow people.

03:19.761 --> 03:21.761
Then one day I snapped.

03:21.763 --> 03:23.929
Decades of people's
lame stereotypes

03:23.931 --> 03:25.931
or complete ignorance
about my homeland

03:25.933 --> 03:28.133
had finally pushed me
over the edge.

03:28.135 --> 03:32.537
Come on, who out there really
knows anything about Canada?

03:32.539 --> 03:33.804
Exactly.

03:33.806 --> 03:35.172
(Epic music)

03:35.174 --> 03:36.940
So I decided to make
a movie about it.

03:36.942 --> 03:39.542
A home movie, about my home.

03:39.544 --> 03:41.777
I would interview
a wide variety of Canadians,

03:41.779 --> 03:43.345
some more known than others.

03:43.347 --> 03:45.347
As well as a variety
of non-Canadians

03:45.349 --> 03:46.981
from around the world,
(Cheering)

03:46.983 --> 03:50.117
while driving from one end
of Canada to the other.

03:50.119 --> 03:52.152
This seemed to be the only way
to get the answers

03:52.154 --> 03:54.154
to the long list of questions

03:54.156 --> 03:56.156
that have plagued me
my whole life,

03:56.158 --> 03:57.957
and show once and for all

03:57.959 --> 03:59.959
we're more than just
igloos and beer.

03:59.961 --> 04:02.962
But, could I finally put
my eternal problem to rest?

04:02.964 --> 04:04.797
There was only one way
to find out.

04:04.799 --> 04:07.132
("Star Wars"-style music)

04:07.134 --> 04:17.175
( ¶¶ )

04:17.177 --> 04:19.677
("Superman" theme music)

04:19.679 --> 04:31.588
( ¶¶ )

04:35.593 --> 04:37.192
I'm here in the Maritimes.

04:37.194 --> 04:40.395
Today is Saturday, June 22nd.

04:40.397 --> 04:42.397
I'm about to begin my journey

04:42.399 --> 04:44.232
to go from coast to coast
in Canada,

04:44.234 --> 04:46.601
and I'm going to find out
what it means being Canadian,

04:46.603 --> 04:48.836
before midnight, July 1st,

04:48.838 --> 04:50.604
Canada Day, in Vancouver.

04:50.606 --> 04:53.039
Hit it, D.J. Brad
and the Queensland dancers!

04:53.041 --> 04:56.609
(Folk music)

04:56.611 --> 04:59.678
Narrator:
As this charming old time
welcome continued around me...

05:01.214 --> 05:03.013
and continued some more,

05:03.015 --> 05:04.581
I consulted my map

05:04.583 --> 05:07.016
on how best to begin
my cross-country drive.

05:07.018 --> 05:09.018
Wow, these guys
really loved dancing,

05:09.020 --> 05:11.220
and they were starting
to make me a little dizzy,

05:11.222 --> 05:13.222
so I decided to just head west.

05:13.224 --> 05:14.856
And I was going to do that

05:14.858 --> 05:18.226
in one very sexy ride!

05:18.228 --> 05:22.229
Commercial announcer:
<i> A beautiful 2012 Chrysler</i>
<i> Town and Country mini-van!</i>

05:22.231 --> 05:23.463
<i> With room for eight,</i>

05:23.465 --> 05:25.264
<i> and doors wide enough</i>

05:25.266 --> 05:26.698
<i> to easily handle big stickers</i>
<i> promoting small movies,</i>

05:26.700 --> 05:28.700
<i> the Town and Country</i>

05:28.702 --> 05:30.635
<i> for all of your cross-Canada</i>
<i> documentary needs!</i>

05:30.637 --> 05:31.902
What's up, ladies!

05:31.904 --> 05:34.037
<i> Retail price is 31,999.</i>

05:34.039 --> 05:36.039
<i> Back to you, Rob!</i>

05:36.041 --> 05:37.440
Rob: (Narrating)
Thanks, Helen.

05:37.442 --> 05:39.241
So, as my journey began,

05:39.243 --> 05:41.876
I realized I had
a huge task ahead of me,

05:41.878 --> 05:43.878
given how big Canada was,

05:43.880 --> 05:46.447
but couldn't be starting
from a more amazing place.

05:46.449 --> 05:47.714
Nova Scotia.

05:47.716 --> 05:53.653
(Folk guitar music)

05:53.655 --> 05:56.055
Rob: (Narrating)
Originally populated
by the Mi'kmaq people,

05:56.057 --> 05:57.890
and on Canada's east coast,

05:57.892 --> 06:00.058
Nova Scotia is famous
for its seafood,

06:00.060 --> 06:01.559
its rugged beauty,

06:01.561 --> 06:04.662
and the iconic lighthouse
at Peggy's Cove.

06:04.664 --> 06:07.064
Since I knew I was going to be
on the road for awhile,

06:07.066 --> 06:08.465
I thought I'd stretch my legs,

06:08.467 --> 06:10.066
and get in some fresh salt air.

06:10.068 --> 06:11.333
And begin finding out

06:11.335 --> 06:13.068
what it really means
to be Canadian

06:13.070 --> 06:14.769
by confirming the issue

06:14.771 --> 06:17.371
that got this whole movie
rolling in the first place.

06:22.411 --> 06:24.244
Rob:
What is the capital of Canada?

06:25.480 --> 06:26.745
(Laughing)

06:26.747 --> 06:28.079
Quebec?

06:28.081 --> 06:30.547
How about,
let's guess...

06:33.485 --> 06:35.485
Arkansas.
(Drunken laughter)

06:35.487 --> 06:37.487
Canada's...
like an old lady.

06:37.489 --> 06:39.288
Like it's quite nice to you,

06:39.290 --> 06:40.522
it's polite,

06:40.524 --> 06:42.090
but you don't really notice it.

06:42.092 --> 06:43.691
I do think about Canada.

06:43.693 --> 06:45.693
When it's really hot
in Bangladesh,

06:45.695 --> 06:47.294
I think of Canada.

06:47.296 --> 06:48.695
Oh, Canadians are easy,

06:48.697 --> 06:50.530
it's Bob and Doug McKenzie,

06:50.532 --> 06:52.131
it's lots of snow,

06:52.133 --> 06:54.533
it's plaid, it's hockey...

06:54.535 --> 06:56.701
Rob:
What do you guys think
the population of Canada is?

06:56.703 --> 06:58.936
Hm...

06:58.938 --> 07:00.704
4,000?

07:00.706 --> 07:01.971
(Slurring)
I say the same.

07:01.973 --> 07:03.205
That's a good estimate.

07:03.207 --> 07:04.506
It's huge.
It is.

07:04.508 --> 07:05.773
It's giant.

07:05.775 --> 07:07.207
Gigantic.

07:07.209 --> 07:09.309
It's a giant piece
of white chocolate

07:09.311 --> 07:10.777
that sits
on top of America.

07:10.779 --> 07:12.945
Rob:
What if I told you
it was a little higher?

07:12.947 --> 07:14.513
Really?
Okay, I'd be like,

07:14.515 --> 07:16.114
6,000.
450.

07:16.116 --> 07:17.515
Rob:
Getting warmer.

07:17.517 --> 07:18.949
Which one?
8,000!

07:18.951 --> 07:20.517
Rob: Bingo.
(Both) Woo!

07:20.519 --> 07:23.119
There's a real sort
of macho stride
to Canadians

07:23.121 --> 07:24.954
that's sort of like
"check me out",

07:24.956 --> 07:27.556
"get out of my way",
"I'll kick your ass".

07:27.558 --> 07:30.125
I think a Canadian
would be very tall,

07:30.127 --> 07:32.727
and have broad shoulders,

07:32.729 --> 07:35.129
and be quite hairy.

07:35.131 --> 07:36.530
Look at your
whole stance
right now.

07:36.532 --> 07:37.797
I know look at me.
It's sort of like

07:37.799 --> 07:39.498
you're going
to deal with me.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.133
Your legs are open,
it's very sexually
provocative.

07:42.135 --> 07:43.534
White, very white.

07:43.536 --> 07:46.136
Slightly red
when they go
out in the sun.

07:46.138 --> 07:47.737
White.
White-red.

07:47.739 --> 07:49.538
They are white.

07:49.540 --> 07:50.771
They have...

07:53.342 --> 07:54.574
they...

07:55.577 --> 07:57.543
they look very clean.

07:57.545 --> 08:00.979
(Laughing)

08:00.981 --> 08:03.348
Yellow, sometimes.
No.

08:03.350 --> 08:05.149
They have a lot
of colours.
Why yellow?

08:05.151 --> 08:06.851
How?

08:06.853 --> 08:08.452
Because I don't know,

08:08.454 --> 08:10.654
when they get ill,
I presume they get
a little bit...

08:10.656 --> 08:12.656
(Chuckling)

08:12.658 --> 08:14.257
Rob: (Narrating)
Pretty depressing, right?

08:14.259 --> 08:16.092
But this is exactly
the sort of stuff

08:16.094 --> 08:18.360
we Canadians have been
dealing with since...

08:18.362 --> 08:20.095
there were Canadians.

08:20.097 --> 08:21.496
But I wasn't the only Canuck

08:21.498 --> 08:23.464
who has had
a life-long issue with this.

08:23.466 --> 08:24.698
So...

08:28.870 --> 08:30.669
The world knows little
about Canada.

08:30.671 --> 08:33.471
I mean, if you go to some places
in the United States,

08:33.473 --> 08:35.272
they couldn't even
tell you where it is.

08:35.274 --> 08:37.474
I think there's a lot of...

08:37.476 --> 08:38.875
mystery involved,

08:38.877 --> 08:40.309
and thank God
you're doing this film.

08:40.311 --> 08:41.677
I think they think
we're mysterious.

08:41.679 --> 08:42.944
They don't know a lot about us.

08:42.946 --> 08:45.479
Just the, kind of...

08:45.481 --> 08:47.681
lack of any
knowledge at all

08:47.683 --> 08:49.883
about the place
that you grew up.

08:49.885 --> 08:51.684
I was a bit surprised
when I was, uh,

08:51.686 --> 08:53.018
just in the States, last month,

08:53.020 --> 08:54.686
and I told someone
I was from Canada.

08:54.688 --> 08:56.287
And they said, "Where's that?"

08:56.289 --> 08:58.022
We don't make headlines a lot

08:58.024 --> 09:00.691
so they're not reading Canada
every day in the paper.

09:00.693 --> 09:02.292
They're reading about,
you know, Afghanistan,

09:02.294 --> 09:04.494
they're reading Iran,
they're reading England.

09:04.496 --> 09:08.897
If we were next to,
um, you know...

09:08.899 --> 09:11.132
Uganda...

09:11.134 --> 09:12.399
we'd stick out
a little bit more.

09:12.401 --> 09:13.967
I swear to you,
people have said,

09:13.969 --> 09:15.902
"I love Canada, it's one
of my favourite cities."

09:15.904 --> 09:18.504
We're just understated.
Right.

09:18.506 --> 09:20.305
To the point
where nobody cares.

09:20.307 --> 09:21.539
(Laughing)

09:21.541 --> 09:23.908
We are sort of
appreciated

09:23.910 --> 09:26.477
in the same way
like Switzerland is.

09:26.479 --> 09:28.011
Supposed to be clean

09:28.013 --> 09:30.313
and they have a good banking
system apparently.

09:30.315 --> 09:31.914
Oh, I've just been to Toronto.

09:31.916 --> 09:33.715
It's so clean.

09:33.717 --> 09:34.982
(Chuckling)

09:34.984 --> 09:36.917
I mean they ask if
you know people a lot.

09:36.919 --> 09:39.519
"Well I have a friend
in Canada.

09:39.521 --> 09:41.187
Maybe you know him."

09:41.189 --> 09:42.922
What's scary is I actually
do know the people,

09:42.924 --> 09:46.858
like, more often
than I would like to admit.

09:46.860 --> 09:48.359
Rob:
People outside of Canada,

09:48.361 --> 09:50.327
if they had to describe
Canada, like, in one word,

09:50.329 --> 09:52.329
what do you think
they would guess?
Igloos!

09:52.331 --> 09:53.663
Together:
(Laughing)

09:53.665 --> 09:57.733
I had people ask me
if I lived in an igloo.

09:57.735 --> 09:59.334
They asked if I lived
in an igloo.

09:59.336 --> 10:01.402
How do you get your news?

10:01.404 --> 10:03.771
'Cause you don't have
radio or television
out there in your igloos.

10:03.773 --> 10:06.540
Beavers.
Lots of beaver.

10:06.542 --> 10:08.174
Lots of beaver.
(Chuckling)

10:08.176 --> 10:09.708
There was a woman
from Sweden

10:09.710 --> 10:11.376
who literally asked me
that if she came to Canada,

10:11.378 --> 10:13.211
would she see polar bears
walking down the street?

10:13.213 --> 10:15.746
It was, uh,
I don't know, July 10th,

10:15.748 --> 10:17.948
and we had cousins
that came up and visited

10:17.950 --> 10:20.183
and they brought, you know...

10:20.185 --> 10:22.185
boots and thick coats.

10:22.187 --> 10:24.086
And we thought, "Really?

10:24.088 --> 10:26.755
You couldn't even have tracked
that information down, huh?"

10:26.757 --> 10:29.758
People think Canada
is a frozen tundra

10:29.760 --> 10:31.025
12 months a year.

10:31.027 --> 10:32.259
Do you have trees up there?

10:32.261 --> 10:33.760
Do you ever see the sun?

10:33.762 --> 10:35.027
Those kind of questions I go,

10:35.029 --> 10:37.763
"F.O. and read a book,
please."

10:37.765 --> 10:39.564
(Laughing)
I do get defensive.

10:39.566 --> 10:40.798
Rob: (Narrating)
See?

10:40.800 --> 10:42.432
I'm not alone in my frustration.

10:42.434 --> 10:44.967
And what's the deal
with the igloo obsession?

10:44.969 --> 10:46.301
And just like igloos,

10:46.303 --> 10:47.969
it was getting cold
out there on the rocks,

10:47.971 --> 10:49.770
and I still had
a lot of ground to cover.

10:49.772 --> 10:51.204
( ¶¶ )

10:51.206 --> 10:52.972
With the country ahead of me,

10:52.974 --> 10:54.773
I'll admit
I was more excited about my trip

10:54.775 --> 10:56.207
than I thought I'd be.

10:56.209 --> 10:57.608
And I will also admit

10:57.610 --> 10:59.376
I was excited
the mini van had a heater.

10:59.378 --> 11:01.978
My blood had thinned
living in the U.S.

11:01.980 --> 11:04.213
But in the spirit of honesty,

11:04.215 --> 11:05.981
before I got too far,

11:05.983 --> 11:07.983
I needed to cop
to something else.

11:07.985 --> 11:09.384
I have never been
to the Maritimes,

11:09.386 --> 11:11.786
before doing this movie.

11:11.788 --> 11:13.053
Man:
Really?

11:13.055 --> 11:14.754
Nope. Never.

11:14.756 --> 11:17.590
I've been stupid for not
exploring my own country,

11:17.592 --> 11:18.958
up until this point.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.994
Because I've been
all around the world,

11:21.996 --> 11:23.996
I just have not been
all around Canada,

11:23.998 --> 11:26.398
which I am
a little embarrassed about.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.233
Rob: (Narrating)
I felt a bit weird saying this,

11:28.235 --> 11:31.002
given how defensive
I'd always been about my home.

11:31.004 --> 11:33.004
But I was going
to see Canada now,

11:33.006 --> 11:35.606
and get the answer to my quest.

11:35.608 --> 11:37.240
Whenever I'm outside of Canada,

11:37.242 --> 11:39.242
people usually think
I'm American.

11:39.244 --> 11:40.810
Then they have their minds blown

11:40.812 --> 11:42.812
when they learn I am Canadian.

11:42.814 --> 11:45.014
Everyone reacts
the same way they would

11:45.016 --> 11:47.249
when their teachers spring
a pop quiz on them.

11:47.251 --> 11:49.417
Surprised, unprepared,

11:49.419 --> 11:50.818
and then wanting to be excused

11:50.820 --> 11:53.420
because they feel queasy
in the pants.

11:53.422 --> 11:56.022
Those reactions really hurt
our feelings.

11:56.024 --> 11:57.823
We're not trying
to trick anybody,

11:57.825 --> 11:59.057
but I want to know...

12:04.097 --> 12:06.630
Being Canadian
is definitely

12:06.632 --> 12:08.832
something I enjoy.

12:08.834 --> 12:10.333
(Laughing)

12:10.335 --> 12:13.636
Just because most people
don't really understand

12:13.638 --> 12:15.270
what a Canadian is,

12:15.272 --> 12:17.839
but they know
we're different,
somehow.

12:17.841 --> 12:19.640
No matter how many times
I said it,

12:19.642 --> 12:20.874
and said it in print

12:20.876 --> 12:22.842
or said it
on the Tonight Show,

12:22.844 --> 12:24.276
everybody I met,
and I would say

12:24.278 --> 12:25.543
"Well you know
I'm a Canadian",

12:25.545 --> 12:27.211
they go, "Really?
You're a Canadian?"

12:27.213 --> 12:30.847
People were surprised
when I told them I was Canadian.

12:30.849 --> 12:33.282
Like you said, they seemed
kind of betrayed by it.

12:33.284 --> 12:35.651
Suddenly I'll say
one word,
Yeah.

12:35.653 --> 12:36.885
Yeah
they'll pick out
and they'll just go,

12:36.887 --> 12:38.219
"You're
Canadian! "

12:38.221 --> 12:39.687
Like I've been
hiding it
from them.

12:39.689 --> 12:43.057
I was the social content
of America for nine years.

12:43.059 --> 12:45.059
Rob: Right.
And I think that the fact
that I was Canadian

12:45.061 --> 12:47.961
was maybe just too
confusing for people.
Right.

12:47.963 --> 12:51.064
You know, it probably goes back
to the McCarthy thing,

12:51.066 --> 12:52.398
they look like us,

12:52.400 --> 12:54.666
they talk like us,
they move like us,

12:54.668 --> 12:56.300
but they're other.

12:56.302 --> 12:59.870
Because, it means
we walk amongst them.

12:59.872 --> 13:02.072
Rob:
This club of Canadians
that all, sort of,

13:02.074 --> 13:03.473
walk around,
knowing, like...

13:03.475 --> 13:04.707
Winking at each other.

13:04.709 --> 13:06.675
They almost look like Americans,

13:06.677 --> 13:09.077
but they almost look
like Russian spies

13:09.079 --> 13:10.678
dressed up as Americans,
you know?
Rob: Right.

13:10.680 --> 13:12.479
We look like Americans,

13:12.481 --> 13:14.881
sometimes we can change
our "abouts" and our "a-bahts",

13:14.883 --> 13:17.083
and we can talk like Americans.

13:17.085 --> 13:19.318
We can wear the same clothes
as Americans,

13:19.320 --> 13:20.719
(Whispering)
but you don't know we're there.

13:20.721 --> 13:24.489
(Eerie music)

13:24.491 --> 13:26.090
Rob: (Narrating)
It's weird, right?

13:26.092 --> 13:27.491
We're not so spooky.

13:27.493 --> 13:29.326
We're really pretty harmless,

13:29.328 --> 13:31.328
unless you try to take
our donuts.

13:31.330 --> 13:34.497
Speaking of which, after buying
a few dozen for the crew,

13:34.499 --> 13:35.831
I drove west,

13:35.833 --> 13:38.500
towards the capital
of Nova Scotia, Halifax.

13:38.502 --> 13:40.335
(Bagpipe music)

13:40.337 --> 13:43.104
Rob: (Narrating)
Halifax is a historic
Canadian city.

13:43.106 --> 13:45.506
It's also rich
in important world history,

13:45.508 --> 13:48.709
as a critical staging ground
for both the Revolutionary War,

13:48.711 --> 13:50.343
the American Civil War,

13:50.345 --> 13:51.577
and World War II.

13:51.579 --> 13:53.011
(Blast)
Man: Woo!

13:53.013 --> 13:54.712
(Church bell tolling)

13:54.714 --> 13:57.514
Growing up, Canadian kids
study all of this in school,

13:57.516 --> 13:59.949
as well as learning the history
of the rest of the world.

13:59.951 --> 14:02.918
But in my experience
outside of Canada,

14:02.920 --> 14:05.720
the rest of the world didn't
seem to return the favour.

14:05.722 --> 14:08.589
So as I walked around town,
I got to thinking...

14:13.528 --> 14:16.362
¶ Let's talk about Canada ¶

14:16.364 --> 14:17.930
¶ Canada ¶

14:17.932 --> 14:21.133
¶ It's the greatest
country in the world ¶

14:21.135 --> 14:22.534
Rob:
If you had to explain
Canada's history

14:22.536 --> 14:24.536
to someone
in two sentences,

14:24.538 --> 14:26.137
what would
it be?

14:26.139 --> 14:28.139
Unknown.

14:28.141 --> 14:30.941
I didn't know
there was Canadian history.

14:30.943 --> 14:33.276
I did not...
I did not know that.

14:33.278 --> 14:36.746
When I was a kid, like,
history books in Canada

14:36.748 --> 14:38.881
were published
in the United States.

14:38.883 --> 14:40.282
Right.

14:40.284 --> 14:41.950
There were no
history books
made in Canada.

14:41.952 --> 14:44.385
And so we studied
American history.
Mm-hm.

14:44.387 --> 14:46.954
Until Pierre Trudeau
became prime minister

14:46.956 --> 14:49.957
and said, "We should
study Canadian history."

14:49.959 --> 14:51.458
My name is Al

14:51.460 --> 14:53.593
and I'm from
outside of Boston,
Massachusetts.

14:53.595 --> 14:55.761
I'm Maddie
and I'm from
Dallas, Texas.

14:55.763 --> 14:58.163
When you were in school,
in Boston,

14:58.165 --> 15:00.465
how much Canadian history
did you learn?

15:00.467 --> 15:03.601
I don't think
we've ever
done anything

15:03.603 --> 15:04.735
on Canada.

15:04.737 --> 15:05.837
I don't think
I learned about

15:05.839 --> 15:08.072
anything about
Canada, really.

15:08.074 --> 15:11.875
K through 12,
we spent on Canadian history,

15:11.877 --> 15:15.278
could have been less than
2 or 3 minutes.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.280
It's the first country ever

15:17.282 --> 15:20.516
to have an unarmed evolution
into existence.

15:20.518 --> 15:24.086
Yes, yes. We didn't have
the balls to have a civil war.

15:24.088 --> 15:27.689
The United States, like France,
had a serious revolution

15:27.691 --> 15:29.524
and killed a lot of people,

15:29.526 --> 15:31.559
which is very appealing
to young people.

15:31.561 --> 15:34.295
We're not a country
that's fought to...

15:34.297 --> 15:36.130
tell our own story
in our own way.

15:36.132 --> 15:38.699
It just seemed like it was
like a business deal

15:38.701 --> 15:40.434
made over lunch, you know?

15:40.436 --> 15:41.802
I don't think
it's a boring history,

15:41.804 --> 15:43.236
I think we don't know
enough about it.

15:43.238 --> 15:46.305
Laura Secord, you know,
was very heroic

15:46.307 --> 15:47.706
and did all sorts of, you know,

15:47.708 --> 15:49.240
mindboggling things.

15:49.242 --> 15:51.108
Laura Secord is the
founding mother of Canada.

15:51.110 --> 15:53.710
She made all of the chocolates
that I ate growing up.

15:53.712 --> 15:54.944
And a lot of people
had, like, a picture

15:54.946 --> 15:56.312
of David Cassidy over their bed,

15:56.314 --> 15:58.113
but I had the Laura Secord
chocolate chart.

15:58.115 --> 15:59.547
It is a vibrant history,

15:59.549 --> 16:02.316
it is an incredibly
bizarre history.

16:02.318 --> 16:05.118
And it's not presented
or taught that way.

16:05.120 --> 16:06.919
I think that's also
a part of why we're so insecure,

16:06.921 --> 16:08.320
we don't believe we're fancy.

16:08.322 --> 16:10.121
Canadian History,

16:10.123 --> 16:13.124
it's like watching a field
of forests die slowly

16:13.126 --> 16:14.558
tree by tree.

16:14.560 --> 16:19.295
The key to Canadian history,
in reverse,

16:19.297 --> 16:20.729
is Walt Disney.

16:20.731 --> 16:23.331
If we had Walt Disney,

16:23.333 --> 16:25.333
we would have had
Davey Crocket, you know.

16:25.335 --> 16:26.667
Who do we have instead?

16:26.669 --> 16:28.502
Uh, and instead,
we had Alex Trebek.

16:28.504 --> 16:32.572
(Laughing)

16:32.574 --> 16:34.073
Okay.

16:34.075 --> 16:35.674
Rob: (Narrating)
But I swear,

16:35.676 --> 16:37.742
Canada does have some exciting
things in our past.

16:37.744 --> 16:39.477
Like...

16:39.479 --> 16:43.580
(Upbeat music)

16:43.582 --> 16:46.749
Louis Riel, one of our fathers
of Confederation,

16:46.751 --> 16:48.751
who was executed for treason.

16:48.753 --> 16:50.586
Or Sir John A. MacDonald.

16:50.588 --> 16:51.820
Our first Prime Minister,

16:51.822 --> 16:53.154
who served six terms,

16:53.156 --> 16:54.822
but was a major drinker,

16:54.824 --> 16:57.758
and became famous for publicly
acting like an idiot.

16:57.760 --> 17:00.160
A tradition that still
lives on today.

17:01.163 --> 17:02.428
But there is one thing

17:02.430 --> 17:03.762
Canada has contributed
to history

17:03.764 --> 17:06.598
that I'm positive
the world knows about.

17:06.600 --> 17:08.166
Canada, we built
that arm

17:08.168 --> 17:10.101
that sticks out
on top of the
space shuttle.

17:10.103 --> 17:11.602
Rob:
Why are we
so proud of it?

17:11.604 --> 17:13.370
Because it says
Canada right on it.

17:13.372 --> 17:15.372
Rob: (Narrating)
Ah, yes, the Canadarm.

17:15.374 --> 17:17.374
It was a huge source
of pride for us,

17:17.376 --> 17:19.976
and you didn't need a rocket
scientist to explain that,

17:19.978 --> 17:21.210
did you?

17:21.212 --> 17:22.477
But in case you do,

17:22.479 --> 17:23.978
we<i> also</i> have one of those!

17:23.980 --> 17:25.779
The purpose
of the robotic arm is,

17:25.781 --> 17:28.615
is to move equipment
such as this

17:28.617 --> 17:31.184
around within the bay
during the flight mission.

17:31.186 --> 17:33.186
Oh, you built the arm
on the space shuttle?

17:34.189 --> 17:35.621
Right.
The Canada arm.

17:35.623 --> 17:37.389
Right.

17:37.391 --> 17:38.656
Not the actual shuttle though,

17:38.658 --> 17:41.659
just the arm? Right.

17:41.661 --> 17:42.960
I think that
the Americans

17:42.962 --> 17:43.860
made the huge
turkey dinner

17:43.862 --> 17:45.061
and we brought
the little Jell-O

17:45.063 --> 17:45.895
with marshmallows
in it.

17:45.897 --> 17:46.962
Sure.
Yeah.

17:48.131 --> 17:49.563
Rob: (Narrating)
And I hate to bring this up,

17:49.565 --> 17:51.464
but we do always have this
bad boy in our back pocket.

17:51.466 --> 17:53.632
We burned down the White House
and it felt good.

17:53.634 --> 17:55.400
(Music: "Oh Canada")

17:55.402 --> 17:57.001
You know in the war of 1812,

17:57.003 --> 17:58.402
all of the politicians
in Washington

17:58.404 --> 18:00.070
have left D.C.

18:00.072 --> 18:01.638
because they think the battle
is going to take place

18:01.640 --> 18:02.905
in some place in Virginia,

18:02.907 --> 18:04.406
so Washington
is basically empty.

18:04.408 --> 18:06.408
Canadians sailed down
the Potomac.

18:06.410 --> 18:08.009
Before they burn down
the White House though,

18:08.011 --> 18:10.411
they sit down
and they have the banquet

18:10.413 --> 18:13.414
that was prepared
for the President

18:13.416 --> 18:15.983
because they thought they were
going to win the battle.

18:15.985 --> 18:17.351
And at the end of the banquet,

18:17.353 --> 18:19.820
the British General
turns to the chef,

18:19.822 --> 18:21.655
the White House chef and says,

18:21.657 --> 18:23.657
"Tell the President
the food was excellent,

18:23.659 --> 18:25.659
but the service left
something to be desired."

18:25.661 --> 18:27.594
( ¶¶ )

18:27.596 --> 18:30.029
Rob: (Narrating)
You've got to admit, that
story is pretty bad-ass.

18:30.031 --> 18:31.830
But if you tell it
to an American,

18:31.832 --> 18:33.665
they'll think you're crazy.

18:33.667 --> 18:35.066
But it's true,

18:35.068 --> 18:36.834
and something I would
have to savour in the car

18:36.836 --> 18:39.236
because I had a lot more
Canada to go.

18:39.238 --> 18:41.671
Plus the weird guy working
the cannon at the fort

18:41.673 --> 18:44.674
kept asking me if I wanted
to see his band play that night.

18:44.676 --> 18:46.275
I did not.

18:46.277 --> 18:49.244
So it was goodbye Nova Scotia
and hello New Brunswick.

18:49.246 --> 18:51.679
(Marching drum)

18:51.681 --> 18:54.448
(Folk music)

18:54.450 --> 18:56.049
New Brunswick
was another province

18:56.051 --> 18:57.283
I had never been to before,

18:57.285 --> 18:58.550
and it was stunning.

18:58.552 --> 18:59.784
Huge forests,

18:59.786 --> 19:01.085
sparsely populated,

19:01.087 --> 19:02.886
and home to
the Picaroons Brewery,

19:02.888 --> 19:05.254
where we stopped off for some
quick Canadian refreshments.

19:07.591 --> 19:08.957
(Bottles clinking)

19:08.959 --> 19:10.458
Rob: (Narrating)
This pit stop was perfect,

19:10.460 --> 19:12.059
and delicious.

19:12.061 --> 19:15.062
From what I can remember.

19:15.064 --> 19:17.464
Thankfully my producer took over
driving duties for a bit

19:17.466 --> 19:21.066
while I "admired the scenery".

19:21.068 --> 19:23.334
(Loons calling)

19:26.272 --> 19:28.939
Rob: (Narrating)
As the Millennium Mini-van
Falcon pressed on,

19:28.941 --> 19:30.407
I was a bit nervous

19:30.409 --> 19:32.275
about exploring
the next question on my list.

19:32.277 --> 19:34.076
Why? Because growing up,

19:34.078 --> 19:37.279
this was the one thing that
every generation of Canadians

19:37.281 --> 19:39.281
<i> would</i> discuss endlessly.

19:39.283 --> 19:43.485
And honestly, I always found it
a bit... unsettling.

19:43.487 --> 19:45.086
Americans didn't do it.

19:45.088 --> 19:46.320
Brits don't.

19:46.322 --> 19:47.788
The Chinese don't do this,

19:47.790 --> 19:49.890
but if you have ever been
in a room with a Canuck,

19:49.892 --> 19:52.893
or even worse, a bargain
rental vehicle with a bunch,

19:52.895 --> 19:54.728
this is bound to come up.

19:54.730 --> 19:56.730
I myself was guilty of it.

19:56.732 --> 19:58.665
So I decided to
once and for all learn...

20:03.304 --> 20:04.569
That's a
good point.

20:04.571 --> 20:05.937
I think that's true.

20:05.939 --> 20:07.905
'Cause I'm always
saying that,

20:07.907 --> 20:09.239
"Oh that guy's Canadian."

20:09.241 --> 20:11.741
The more you find out
who is Canadian

20:11.743 --> 20:14.110
the more you're like
"Yessss!" "Score!"

20:14.112 --> 20:16.245
Like Leslie Nielsen,
Yessss!

20:16.247 --> 20:19.114
To them he's an American icon,
to us he's one of ours.

20:19.116 --> 20:20.648
Lorne Michaels.

20:20.650 --> 20:22.916
Biggest name in television
right now, you know?

20:22.918 --> 20:25.184
Pretty much controls all of NBC.

20:25.186 --> 20:26.652
He's from Toronto.

20:26.654 --> 20:28.920
Mary Pickford, you know,
America's sweetheart.

20:28.922 --> 20:30.154
She was Canadian.

20:30.156 --> 20:31.922
Max Senate,
he was Canadian.

20:31.924 --> 20:33.523
You like Loverboy?
Yeah, that's us.

20:33.525 --> 20:35.925
Fay Ray
is from Canada.

20:35.927 --> 20:37.326
Uh, Louis B. Mayer,
Canadian.

20:37.328 --> 20:38.660
The Warner Brothers,
Canadian.

20:38.662 --> 20:40.928
The list, all of them
know the list

20:40.930 --> 20:43.330
of who did what
in Canada.

20:43.332 --> 20:44.764
I think Canadians, you know,

20:44.766 --> 20:47.133
like to kind of pipe up and say,

20:47.135 --> 20:50.936
you know really, look who came
from our community.

20:50.938 --> 20:52.304
Rob:
Right.

20:52.306 --> 20:54.339
And, uh, it comes
from our insecurity,

20:54.341 --> 20:55.807
and our low self-esteem.

20:55.809 --> 20:57.341
We want to make sure Americans
know that, like,

20:57.343 --> 21:00.344
"Oh we, we've had impact
on this culture also."

21:00.346 --> 21:02.846
Takes us to go, "No no no,
that person you like?

21:02.848 --> 21:04.547
"Yes, he's Canadian as well.

21:04.549 --> 21:07.049
She's Canadian.
They are Canadian".

21:07.051 --> 21:08.617
I mean, it's the same reason

21:08.619 --> 21:10.352
that Jews want to point out
who's Jewish.

21:10.354 --> 21:12.153
And I'm Jewish
and Canadian

21:12.155 --> 21:13.387
and so I'm doing it
all the time.

21:13.389 --> 21:14.654
(Wheezing)

21:14.656 --> 21:16.155
The word in Yiddish is<i> nachas.</i>

21:16.157 --> 21:18.557
They have a tremendous amount
of<i> nachas,</i>

21:18.559 --> 21:22.560
pride in anyone
who is Canadian who succeeds

21:22.562 --> 21:24.562
anywhere in the rest
of the world.

21:24.564 --> 21:27.164
Like, an American will
come up to me and say,
um, you know,

21:27.166 --> 21:30.800
"I love 'Family Ties'"
or "I love 'Back to
the Future'" or whatever.

21:30.802 --> 21:32.968
Um, a Canadian will
always come up and
say, "We're Canadian".

21:32.970 --> 21:35.904
"Hey we're from Canada."
And I was, "Where
are you from?"

21:35.906 --> 21:38.473
You know, "I'm from
Esterhazy, I'm from...

21:38.475 --> 21:40.141
Winnipeg," you know,

21:40.143 --> 21:41.842
and it's like,
"Oh yeah, I'm from Burnaby,

21:41.844 --> 21:43.143
we have so much in common."

21:43.145 --> 21:46.179
Your excitement
upon meeting them

21:46.181 --> 21:49.148
doubles because
they're Canadian.

21:49.150 --> 21:50.082
Good to see you.

21:50.084 --> 21:51.083
Rob: Good
to see you,
brother.

21:51.085 --> 21:52.484
Canadian?
Yes.
Me too.

21:52.486 --> 21:54.219
It's that connection.

21:54.221 --> 21:56.821
Again, it's that thing
where we seek each other out.

21:56.823 --> 21:59.990
I don't know why
it is important, but it is.

21:59.992 --> 22:01.691
Rob: (Narrating)
And as a little nerd,

22:01.693 --> 22:04.393
no one embodied my participation
in this phenomenon better

22:04.395 --> 22:06.395
than when I told anyone
who would listen

22:06.397 --> 22:09.831
that Captain James T. Kirk
was Canadian.

22:09.833 --> 22:11.833
("Star Trek"-style eerie SFX)

22:11.835 --> 22:14.001
Why does that
have to wreck it
for them?

22:14.003 --> 22:16.203
'Cause they want the best
people on their team.

22:16.205 --> 22:17.837
He's one of our
national treasures,

22:17.839 --> 22:20.840
and ironically
he comes from Canada.

22:20.842 --> 22:23.008
He's also
the epitome

22:23.010 --> 22:25.844
of how America
foists itself

22:25.846 --> 22:27.278
into the world.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.546
The prime directive
of the Federation was,

22:29.548 --> 22:32.950
you cannot influence
the culture of a planet.

22:32.952 --> 22:35.118
And every episode
ended with Kirk

22:35.120 --> 22:37.320
running into the chambers
of the President,

22:37.322 --> 22:40.323
going, "Your god is a lie!
Give us your Zenite!"

22:40.325 --> 22:41.957
I think it says
more about you

22:41.959 --> 22:44.526
than it does
about Captain Kirk.

22:44.528 --> 22:45.960
Well, what are
you perceiving?

22:45.962 --> 22:47.227
What is your...?

22:47.229 --> 22:49.729
Well there's a need
to say, you know,

22:49.731 --> 22:51.330
Captain Kirk
is Canadian,

22:51.332 --> 22:53.332
and I'm Canadian.

22:53.334 --> 22:55.133
You're trying to elevate
yourself a little bit.

22:55.135 --> 22:56.634
Rob:
Right.
Yeah.

22:56.636 --> 22:58.135
What other problems
do you notice about me?

22:58.137 --> 22:59.736
I'd love to
document that.

22:59.738 --> 23:01.337
Well physical
appearance but
I would just,

23:01.339 --> 23:02.971
that's another issue,
and I think, you know,

23:02.973 --> 23:05.540
we can talk
about the whole
clothing thing

23:05.542 --> 23:08.142
after the...
after the interview.

23:08.144 --> 23:09.543
Rob: (Narrating)
But why don't we get
the final word

23:09.545 --> 23:11.144
on my childhood obsession

23:11.146 --> 23:12.745
from the man himself?

23:12.747 --> 23:15.147
Rob:
If Captain Kirk
was Canadian

23:15.149 --> 23:16.548
and wanted everybody
off the ship,

23:16.550 --> 23:17.815
how would he say it
in the Canadian...?

23:17.817 --> 23:20.150
(With Canadian accent)
"Get out!

23:20.152 --> 23:21.751
Get out!

23:21.753 --> 23:24.153
You...

23:24.155 --> 23:25.754
Labrator!"

23:25.756 --> 23:28.156
(Chuckling)
My, what idiots!

23:28.158 --> 23:29.423
Rob: (Narrating)
You know what?

23:29.425 --> 23:30.924
It doesn't matter
what that guy says,

23:30.926 --> 23:33.359
I am always going to think
he is the coolest.

23:33.361 --> 23:35.761
As for my trip,
I was only two days in,

23:35.763 --> 23:37.229
and it was dawning on me

23:37.231 --> 23:39.364
that some of
the silly Canadian stereotypes

23:39.366 --> 23:40.732
may have some merit.

23:40.734 --> 23:44.001
However, as we stopped
for gas in Fredericton,

23:44.003 --> 23:45.569
this happened.

23:45.571 --> 23:47.337
A woman saw the sign
on our van,

23:47.339 --> 23:49.372
and when she learned we were
driving across the country,

23:49.374 --> 23:51.774
trying to find out what
it means to be Canadian,

23:51.776 --> 23:53.776
she insisted she wanted
to contribute.

23:53.778 --> 23:55.744
Contribution
to your drive.

23:55.746 --> 23:57.045
I appreciate it.

23:57.047 --> 23:58.679
Rob: (Narrating)
She was so sweet.

23:58.681 --> 24:01.181
She and her husband even
bought us snacks for the road.

24:01.183 --> 24:02.415
See you later.

24:02.417 --> 24:04.183
Rob: (Narrating)
That's her husband,

24:04.185 --> 24:05.717
but he couldn't go on camera
because he was listening

24:05.719 --> 24:07.685
to a hockey game on the
car radio. Of course.

24:07.687 --> 24:09.520
I mean, she was so sweet.

24:09.522 --> 24:10.754
Everybody there
was so unbelievably nice.

24:10.756 --> 24:12.589
Colin:
They were so nice.

24:12.591 --> 24:14.591
Rob: (Narrating)
And they fortunately,
or unfortunately,

24:14.593 --> 24:15.858
brought up another question

24:15.860 --> 24:17.326
I have been asked my whole life.

24:22.032 --> 24:25.199
The Canadian superhero
I would call,

24:25.201 --> 24:27.601
possibly,
"Manners-Man".

24:27.603 --> 24:29.402
He's very well kempt,

24:29.404 --> 24:32.037
he's very polite,
he'll fly up to a window,

24:32.039 --> 24:33.271
but then tap
on the window

24:33.273 --> 24:34.605
before breaking
through it.

24:34.607 --> 24:37.407
He always has a sweater.
(Chuckling)

24:37.409 --> 24:42.412
Politeness is one thing
that extends to all of Canada.

24:42.414 --> 24:45.415
Um, everybody knows us
for apologizing for things,

24:45.417 --> 24:47.216
and yeah it's a stereotype,

24:47.218 --> 24:49.051
but it's a true stereotype.

24:49.053 --> 24:51.620
If I knock into the couch,

24:51.622 --> 24:53.221
I say sorry to the couch.

24:53.223 --> 24:54.589
If I hit the wrong key,

24:54.591 --> 24:55.923
on my keyboard,
I'll say, "Oops, sorry".

24:55.925 --> 24:57.624
I was on vacation recently,

24:57.626 --> 25:01.427
and I bumped into a tree
and I apologized to that tree.

25:01.429 --> 25:04.062
Twice I was rear-ended
and I apologized,

25:04.064 --> 25:05.730
and they drove off.

25:05.732 --> 25:09.233
We went to the Hudson Bay
and we were in an elevator

25:09.235 --> 25:12.069
and all I did was just
move my shoulder a little bit

25:12.071 --> 25:14.438
and someone said "sorry" and
then I turned around this way,

25:14.440 --> 25:16.440
and another person
on my left said "sorry".

25:16.442 --> 25:18.642
And my daughters
were, like, they were amazed.

25:18.644 --> 25:20.644
So I would,
when we would go in elevators,

25:20.646 --> 25:22.646
I said, "this elevator
ride is going to be

25:22.648 --> 25:25.515
a 3-sorry elevator ride
or a 2-sorry elevator ride".

25:25.517 --> 25:27.650
Quick story.
Sure.
I'm in Vancouver.

25:27.652 --> 25:29.652
There's a building on fire.
"Let's go check that out".

25:29.654 --> 25:32.655
We pull over, about 60 people
have already gathered.

25:32.657 --> 25:34.456
Cop walks up to
the fireman and says,

25:34.458 --> 25:36.458
"Is there
anything I can do?"

25:36.460 --> 25:39.661
He says, "Well, you can
move all those people
back to the street."

25:39.663 --> 25:42.363
I thought, "Good luck".
And he said, "All right, folks,

25:42.365 --> 25:44.431
I'm just going to need y'all
to move back to the street."

25:44.433 --> 25:46.266
And everybody just went...

25:46.268 --> 25:49.269
I'm always impressed
when somebody walks in and goes,

25:49.271 --> 25:51.271
"I want a steak and I want this
and I want this".

25:51.273 --> 25:52.772
I'm like,
"That guy is such a badass".

25:52.774 --> 25:54.473
(Laughing)

25:54.475 --> 25:56.107
Rob: (Narrating)
And upon further reflection,

25:56.109 --> 25:58.676
this is one
stereotypical Canadian trait

25:58.678 --> 26:00.644
that has had positive effects.

26:00.646 --> 26:03.113
When I came to the United States

26:03.115 --> 26:04.681
I was well received

26:04.683 --> 26:07.116
and everywhere I went,
people said,

26:07.118 --> 26:09.685
"Oh you're Canadian, you're
automatically a nice person".

26:09.687 --> 26:11.286
When I'm in other parts
of the world,

26:11.288 --> 26:13.354
when people find out
that I'm... Canadian,

26:13.356 --> 26:15.222
they almost seem
relieved, actually.
Mm-hm.

26:15.224 --> 26:16.890
Yeah, no, it's true,
when you're abroad,

26:16.892 --> 26:18.291
that for sure happens.

26:18.293 --> 26:20.226
"Oh! Oh, thank God."

26:20.228 --> 26:21.493
It's like, you know,
like in Turkey,

26:21.495 --> 26:24.295
they go, you know,
"American?"

26:24.297 --> 26:25.529
And I go,
"No, Canadian."

26:25.531 --> 26:28.498
They go,
"Ahh. Sorry. Sorry!"

26:28.500 --> 26:31.901
Like, I remember the
first place I travelled
when I was young,

26:31.903 --> 26:35.137
obviously it was Amsterdam,
when I was 18.

26:35.139 --> 26:37.305
When I showed up
at my first café,

26:37.307 --> 26:39.640
people literally
were not that cool to me.

26:39.642 --> 26:43.377
And then, then they started
noticing this little
Canadian flag on my T-shirt,

26:43.379 --> 26:45.879
everyone was like,
"Oh, oh right over here,
oh you want a drink?

26:45.881 --> 26:47.714
Sit down, where you from?
Let's talk!"

26:47.716 --> 26:49.749
And it was a little bizarre.

26:49.751 --> 26:53.319
We're crippled with niceness
and that's a problem because,

26:53.321 --> 26:56.922
uh, the rest of the world
views us as a,

26:56.924 --> 26:59.157
you know, a wussy country.

26:59.159 --> 27:04.161
I'm confused by why
and how it came to be

27:04.163 --> 27:06.930
that we are slaves
to our courtesy.

27:06.932 --> 27:09.332
Well, I think it's
a little nutty, if you ask me.

27:09.334 --> 27:11.334
We have an existential crisis

27:11.336 --> 27:14.170
of "I don't even
deserve to exist".

27:14.172 --> 27:15.905
Rob: (Narrating)
Alanis was right.

27:15.907 --> 27:19.174
I know I'd spent my entire life
apologizing just to be safe.

27:19.176 --> 27:22.177
Even when people said
dumb stuff about Canada.

27:22.179 --> 27:24.546
But are we too nice
for our own good?

27:24.548 --> 27:27.782
I wanted to find out
where our famous Canadian
politeness came from,

27:27.784 --> 27:30.751
once and for all,
by taking a detour off my route,

27:30.753 --> 27:32.753
and speaking to an expert
in the field.

27:32.755 --> 27:38.358
(Baroque music)

27:38.360 --> 27:39.592
Hey.
Hello. Rob?

27:39.594 --> 27:40.859
Yes.
Linda Allen.

27:40.861 --> 27:42.260
Thank you so much.
How are you?

27:42.262 --> 27:43.961
I'm great.
Welcome back
to Canada.

27:43.963 --> 27:45.228
Thank you.

27:45.230 --> 27:46.596
Linda:
My name is Linda Allen.

27:46.598 --> 27:48.197
My company goes
by the name
of Linda Allen

27:48.199 --> 27:50.766
and I'm an
etiquette expert.

27:50.768 --> 27:53.568
And do you think
that it's an
amazing coincidence

27:53.570 --> 27:55.770
that your company
is named after you?

27:55.772 --> 27:57.972
Uh, no, no,
not at all.

27:57.974 --> 28:00.774
I purposely set out
to put my name
to my company.

28:00.776 --> 28:02.275
Smart.

28:02.277 --> 28:03.776
As we discussed before,
we're sort of known

28:03.778 --> 28:05.043
correct or incorrect,

28:05.045 --> 28:06.778
for being
unbelievably polite.

28:06.780 --> 28:08.379
Yeah, and we're not
sort of known,

28:08.381 --> 28:11.215
we're well known
for being
unbelievably polite,

28:11.217 --> 28:12.783
you're right.
So expand on that.

28:12.785 --> 28:14.584
Like, why do you
think that is?

28:14.586 --> 28:16.986
Well, I think
it goes back,
in some sense,

28:16.988 --> 28:18.587
to our
Parliamentarian
system,

28:18.589 --> 28:19.988
I mean our,
you know,

28:19.990 --> 28:22.223
we hail from
British rule,

28:22.225 --> 28:25.392
and differences,
they're polite,

28:25.394 --> 28:27.794
everybody thinks
of them as just...

28:27.796 --> 28:30.596
amazingly
well-mannered.

28:30.598 --> 28:31.997
So if that camera were,
let's say,

28:31.999 --> 28:35.000
the guy at a front desk
at a hotel in Spain

28:35.002 --> 28:38.003
and he had done you wrong,
how would you admonish him?

28:38.005 --> 28:41.406
Well I'd still go
up to the counter
and I'd say,

28:41.408 --> 28:43.608
"Excuse me,
I don't mean to be rude

28:43.610 --> 28:47.411
but I wanted to let you know
that my bill is incorrect

28:47.413 --> 28:50.247
and I'm wondering if you
could... take a look at this

28:50.249 --> 28:52.415
and just see if I'm right".

28:52.417 --> 28:54.016
So that's, yeah...
And then if I was...

28:54.018 --> 28:55.617
It's not very
aggressive is it?

28:55.619 --> 28:57.018
But then
if I was him

28:57.020 --> 28:59.420
and I said
in my non-existent
Spanish accent,

28:59.422 --> 29:02.823
"No I think, uh,
you did order
300 pornos

29:02.825 --> 29:05.258
and all these muffins
so you got to pay."

29:05.260 --> 29:07.026
Gosh, I wish I could
hit you back

29:07.028 --> 29:08.427
with something
to say that I...

29:08.429 --> 29:10.262
Well bring it,
unleash the Canadian fury.

29:10.264 --> 29:12.030
But I think we would
just roll our eyes,

29:12.032 --> 29:13.297
shrug our shoulders.

29:13.299 --> 29:15.432
We're so afraid to,

29:15.434 --> 29:18.435
um, to put
someone else down

29:18.437 --> 29:21.037
or something else down
because in our culture,

29:21.039 --> 29:22.705
that says more about us

29:22.707 --> 29:25.007
than the rudeness that was
emitted from someone else.

29:25.009 --> 29:27.642
Canada was built on
an ancient Indian
burial ground

29:27.644 --> 29:29.443
and instead
of poltergeists,
(Laughing)

29:29.445 --> 29:31.845
we have apologies
that are haunting us,
and we just...

29:31.847 --> 29:34.113
we're not going to do
anything about it.
Yeah.

29:34.115 --> 29:35.948
Thank you so much.

29:35.950 --> 29:37.849
Oh thank you,
it was a pleasure.

29:37.851 --> 29:39.116
Rob: (Narrating)
Wow.

29:39.118 --> 29:40.817
We may be sicker
than I thought.

29:40.819 --> 29:43.286
Even when confronted
with something we didn't do,

29:43.288 --> 29:45.855
our instinct
is to beg forgiveness.

29:45.857 --> 29:47.122
I wanted to process this,

29:47.124 --> 29:48.490
but had to get back on the road

29:48.492 --> 29:50.859
if I was going to make
my Canada Day deadline.

29:50.861 --> 29:52.327
But first,

29:52.329 --> 29:54.462
there was some official
business to attend to.

29:54.464 --> 30:00.467
(Muzak)

30:00.469 --> 30:02.368
Oh, excuse us.
Sorry, everyone.

30:02.370 --> 30:03.869
Sorry I'm alive,
I'm sorry I made it,

30:03.871 --> 30:05.303
I'm sorry I'm a success.

30:05.305 --> 30:07.004
Surry?
Ooh, sorry.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.839
Sorry, I didn't do that
right the first time.

30:08.841 --> 30:10.307
Rob:
No, there's
no wrong.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.541
You don't need
to apologize
for apologizing.

30:11.543 --> 30:12.909
Oh, sorry!
I'm sorry.

30:12.911 --> 30:14.143
I'm sorry.
Sorreehh...

30:14.145 --> 30:15.677
I'm sorry.

30:15.679 --> 30:16.944
Oh my god, sorry.

30:16.946 --> 30:18.178
I'm sorry I exist.

30:19.481 --> 30:20.847
Oh sorry, sorry, I'm sorry.

30:20.849 --> 30:22.114
I'm so sorry.
Sorry.

30:22.116 --> 30:23.348
(Chuckling)
Sorry.

30:23.350 --> 30:24.615
Sorry.
<i> Je m'excuse.</i>

30:24.617 --> 30:25.849
I'm sorry
these people

30:25.851 --> 30:27.350
have to listen
to us saying sorry.

30:27.352 --> 30:29.185
I'm sorry.

30:29.187 --> 30:32.354
I'm sorry, but thank you
very, very much for watching.

30:32.356 --> 30:34.989
I'm Ann Luu, CTV news,
Vancouver,

30:34.991 --> 30:36.423
and I'm sorry.

30:36.425 --> 30:40.092
(Singing)
¶ I've neve-e-e-r... ¶

30:40.094 --> 30:42.194
( ¶¶ )

30:42.196 --> 30:45.396
¶ been so sorry-y-y ¶

30:47.166 --> 30:51.601
(Dissonant music)

30:51.603 --> 30:52.835
(Turns off organ)

30:52.837 --> 30:54.670
Sorry.

30:54.672 --> 30:57.439
Rob: (Narrating)
I think we just earned
our Canadian tax credits.

30:57.441 --> 30:59.774
And maybe
it's not so bad being nice.

30:59.776 --> 31:02.209
But, we shouldn't get too cocky.

31:02.211 --> 31:03.610
Because my whole life,

31:03.612 --> 31:05.445
I had always felt
that our politeness

31:05.447 --> 31:08.014
actually may be
covering up something

31:08.016 --> 31:10.216
a bit more sinister?

31:10.218 --> 31:10.516
Oh yeah.

31:14.455 --> 31:16.822
Somebody who's very close
to me said Canadians

31:16.824 --> 31:20.058
are the most passive-
aggressive people
they've ever met.

31:20.060 --> 31:21.659
Like, I met some
people in Canada

31:21.661 --> 31:23.360
who seemed to have issues.
You know what I mean?

31:23.362 --> 31:25.328
Like,
resentments,

31:25.330 --> 31:27.530
and didn't let it out,
they didn't say anything.

31:27.532 --> 31:29.565
But, like, behind their eyes,

31:29.567 --> 31:31.500
kind of like the
look you're giving
me right now.

31:31.502 --> 31:33.468
Like, "Great answer.

31:33.470 --> 31:35.636
I love the answer".

31:35.638 --> 31:36.870
Rob:
But I actually
hate the answer,

31:36.872 --> 31:38.204
but I'm too polite
to say it.

31:38.206 --> 31:39.872
Exactly, you hate the answer.
Right.

31:39.874 --> 31:43.642
See, this is a perfect example
of the Canadian problem.

31:43.644 --> 31:46.044
It's the home of the
backhanded compliment.

31:46.046 --> 31:48.379
"Hey, uh, you know, you're
that guy from that show,"

31:48.381 --> 31:50.147
and you're like, "Yeah, yeah,"
and they'll say,

31:50.149 --> 31:51.715
"Yeah, I saw that prison movie
you did though.

31:51.717 --> 31:53.349
Man, that was bad, huh?"

31:53.351 --> 31:54.650
Well, we're nice
as long as you're nice,

31:54.652 --> 31:56.051
and as soon
as you become a dick,

31:56.053 --> 31:58.486
we're gonna become
extra big dicks.

31:58.488 --> 31:59.720
That's true.

31:59.722 --> 32:01.254
Extra big dicks.

32:01.256 --> 32:04.857
People think of Canadians
as kind of peaceful people

32:04.859 --> 32:06.258
and all that stuff

32:06.260 --> 32:08.059
and not being in a big hurry
to get into wars

32:08.061 --> 32:11.062
and not having handguns.

32:11.064 --> 32:13.864
But you know, our national
past-time is this game

32:13.866 --> 32:16.066
where we, like,
just pummel each other.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.667
Rogen:
When my friends
come from Canada,

32:17.669 --> 32:19.268
they're not, like,
the mellow ones

32:19.270 --> 32:21.870
at the premiere party
that I've brought them to.

32:21.872 --> 32:23.238
They're the ones
everyone's looking at, like,

32:23.240 --> 32:25.273
"Who the fuck are these guys?"

32:25.275 --> 32:26.674
"How did they get in here?"

32:26.676 --> 32:28.442
"Why are they screaming"
and, you know,

32:28.444 --> 32:31.077
"drinking 10 times more than
everyone else at this party?"

32:31.079 --> 32:32.678
When we get a
little bit crazy,

32:32.680 --> 32:34.680
like, we riot
over a hockey game

32:34.682 --> 32:38.283
or one of our mayors is accused
of smoking crack cocaine,

32:38.285 --> 32:40.084
I think to the rest
of the world,

32:40.086 --> 32:42.286
they kind of go,
"Oh yeah, Canada,

32:42.288 --> 32:43.920
I forgot about them."

32:43.922 --> 32:47.089
And it almost gives us
a little bit of street cred.

32:47.091 --> 32:48.623
Rob: (Narrating)
Between you and me,

32:48.625 --> 32:50.891
I think this trip is going
pretty well so far.

32:50.893 --> 32:53.693
My attempt to uncover the
mysteries of the Canadian psyche

32:53.695 --> 32:55.528
has been very interesting,

32:55.530 --> 32:56.896
but a bit scary.

32:56.898 --> 32:58.530
Coincidentally,
the same two thoughts

32:58.532 --> 33:00.131
that went through my mind

33:00.133 --> 33:01.899
when Theresa Barnett
forced my hand up her blouse

33:01.901 --> 33:03.533
at our grade seven dance.

33:03.535 --> 33:05.902
But more on my
junior high school days later.

33:05.904 --> 33:08.304
Right now, to stay on schedule,

33:08.306 --> 33:10.706
I needed to hit
my next stop before dark.

33:10.708 --> 33:12.908
So as the sun began
to set on Day 2,

33:12.910 --> 33:14.709
I zoomed on into...

33:14.711 --> 33:16.010
(With French accent)
Québec.

33:21.717 --> 33:23.450
(Accordion music)

33:23.452 --> 33:25.919
Quebec is a very significant
province within our nation,

33:25.921 --> 33:27.720
and to my personal history.

33:27.722 --> 33:29.722
It acts as the gateway
from the Maritimes

33:29.724 --> 33:31.156
into Anglo-Canada,

33:31.158 --> 33:33.725
and my mother was born there,
in Montreal.

33:33.727 --> 33:36.327
And going back to our
supposedly boring history,

33:36.329 --> 33:38.929
in the 1960s,
Quebec was also the home

33:38.931 --> 33:41.131
of our own version
of a terrorist group,

33:41.133 --> 33:43.333
the Front de Libération
du Québec.

33:43.335 --> 33:45.935
Who fought and killed
for an independent,

33:45.937 --> 33:48.570
French-speaking
"workers" society.

33:48.572 --> 33:50.138
The other thing
I remember growing up

33:50.140 --> 33:52.940
was a lot of Quebecois,
my fellow Canadians,

33:52.942 --> 33:56.343
kept voting on wanting
to separate from Canada.

33:56.345 --> 33:58.345
Every few years,
they would hold a referendum,

33:58.347 --> 34:01.581
and I would watch my parents
sit nervously by the TV,

34:01.583 --> 34:03.082
hoping our country
would stay together.

34:03.084 --> 34:04.750
Good evening,
the polls have just closed...

34:04.752 --> 34:06.151
Rob: (Narrating)
Our Anglo-French combo

34:06.153 --> 34:08.586
always seemed
very volatile to me,

34:08.588 --> 34:11.355
so I thought this was the
perfect opportunity to explore.

34:14.960 --> 34:16.626
We have two
official languages

34:16.628 --> 34:18.461
that don't even like each
other, that don't even...

34:18.463 --> 34:20.496
Okay, don't try
to glom onto our two
official languages.

34:20.498 --> 34:22.498
Does anybody speak
French in Calgary?
Have you ever heard it?

34:22.500 --> 34:24.266
It has one positive effect,

34:24.268 --> 34:26.368
which it kind of, uh,

34:26.370 --> 34:28.103
maintains a high degree
of tension.

34:28.105 --> 34:30.605
The only time I ever have
tension towards people in Quebec

34:30.607 --> 34:31.973
is referendum time

34:31.975 --> 34:33.975
because of the idea
of splitting Canada up

34:33.977 --> 34:35.609
makes me mad
to the point where...

34:35.611 --> 34:37.210
We're suddenly realizing,

34:37.212 --> 34:38.611
"Oh my god, we could
blow a hole in this country,"

34:38.613 --> 34:39.979
where you almost
want to say to them,

34:39.981 --> 34:41.981
"You guys are nuts,
like, please stay".

34:41.983 --> 34:43.615
Yeah.

34:43.617 --> 34:46.985
I was never in the sort of
French-English problem.

34:46.987 --> 34:49.988
I did have one of my favourite
lines came out of that,

34:49.990 --> 34:52.190
which was,
"My father never lived

34:52.192 --> 34:54.959
to fulfil his dream
of an all Yiddish-
speaking Canada".

34:54.961 --> 34:58.696
(Speaking French)

35:09.208 --> 35:11.641
When we start reading about
what happened to the French,

35:11.643 --> 35:14.010
and how they couldn't even
speak in their own language,

35:14.012 --> 35:16.012
working for the Hudson's Bay
and stuff like that,

35:16.014 --> 35:17.413
being fired all that,

35:17.415 --> 35:18.747
you got to throw
all that stuff in.

35:18.749 --> 35:21.249
(Continues in French)

35:24.020 --> 35:26.487
(Speaking in French)

35:35.063 --> 35:37.663
It's just another one
of those incredible,

35:37.665 --> 35:40.432
sort of unique,
really unique things
about Canada.

35:40.434 --> 35:42.033
It's not this...

35:42.035 --> 35:44.235
it isn't the dull...

35:44.237 --> 35:45.836
asexual country

35:45.838 --> 35:49.439
that I laughingly
labelled it early on.

35:49.441 --> 35:50.873
Rob: (Narrating)
But where exactly

35:50.875 --> 35:53.242
did all of our longtime
English-French conflict

35:53.244 --> 35:56.044
get started?
I wanted to see for myself,

35:56.046 --> 35:59.447
and headed to what I was told
was the actual spot.

35:59.449 --> 36:01.115
This is where it all happened.

36:01.117 --> 36:03.050
Much like the two girls
off to my left

36:03.052 --> 36:05.685
who are fighting for
the attention of boys,

36:05.687 --> 36:07.687
this is where
the British and the French

36:07.689 --> 36:11.057
had their epic battle
basically for Canada.

36:11.059 --> 36:13.059
The Generals Montcalm and Wolfe

36:13.061 --> 36:14.693
leading the French
and British army

36:14.695 --> 36:15.960
fought it out like maniacs

36:15.962 --> 36:17.461
to see who would get
the future of Canada.

36:17.463 --> 36:19.062
The battle
lasted fifteen minutes,

36:19.064 --> 36:20.463
both generals were killed,

36:20.465 --> 36:21.864
and nothing was resolved.

36:21.866 --> 36:24.266
So, uh,
a classic Canadian resolution.

36:24.268 --> 36:26.268
The English
held their ground longer

36:26.270 --> 36:28.470
and Canada became
an Anglo nation,

36:28.472 --> 36:31.473
and the French
stayed here in Quebec,

36:31.475 --> 36:33.074
in their little stronghold,

36:33.076 --> 36:35.910
and I think this is what started
the French-English issue

36:35.912 --> 36:37.144
and the separatist movement.

36:37.146 --> 36:39.346
(Speaking in French)

36:46.888 --> 36:48.888
The gap between separating
and referendum

36:48.890 --> 36:50.489
is actually getting bigger now.

36:50.491 --> 36:52.924
People do not want to separate
as much as they did.

36:52.926 --> 36:55.493
The gap before in '95
was 1% if I'm mistaken,

36:55.495 --> 36:56.961
now it's even getting
bigger and bigger.

36:56.963 --> 36:58.495
So the chance of them
actually separating,

36:58.497 --> 37:01.097
to be honest with you,
aren't very likely.

37:01.099 --> 37:03.099
Rob: (Narrating)
This was a huge relief to hear,

37:03.101 --> 37:05.101
and I was loving
my time in Quebec.

37:05.103 --> 37:07.503
Which was strange to say
because growing up,

37:07.505 --> 37:10.105
my only lengthy exposure
to Canada's French side

37:10.107 --> 37:12.907
was on the side of
my cereal boxes in the morning.

37:12.909 --> 37:15.509
But this trip confirmed
Quebec was awesome.

37:15.511 --> 37:18.111
My French-Canadian peeps
were very cool,

37:18.113 --> 37:20.113
and basically just like me,

37:20.115 --> 37:22.115
but with a higher tolerance
for accordion music

37:22.117 --> 37:23.349
and underage smoking.

37:24.919 --> 37:26.685
I was beginning to think

37:26.687 --> 37:28.920
all the ignorant comments some
of my Alberta relatives made

37:28.922 --> 37:32.123
about French Canadians being
rude, was completely unearned.

37:32.125 --> 37:35.326
(Speaking in French)

37:35.328 --> 37:37.494
Rob: (Narrating)
This shows what happens
when you generalize.

37:37.496 --> 37:39.329
But those cereal boxes
I mentioned

37:39.331 --> 37:42.098
lead me to another question
on my list: food.

37:42.100 --> 37:44.333
Not for me, because
I had just treated the crew

37:44.335 --> 37:45.934
to some killer poutine.

37:45.936 --> 37:48.670
Delicious, but it literally
almost killed us.

37:48.672 --> 37:50.171
And made me wonder,

37:50.173 --> 37:52.139
if you name almost
any country in the world,

37:52.141 --> 37:54.141
you can list
their iconic dishes.

37:54.143 --> 37:55.375
But I never know what to say

37:55.377 --> 37:57.210
when non-Canadians
ask me...

38:01.549 --> 38:04.149
In my town,
I believe we had a
Chinese restaurant

38:04.151 --> 38:06.351
and there was
a symbol on
the front sign

38:06.353 --> 38:08.152
of a Chinese man
in a coolie hat

38:08.154 --> 38:09.786
shaking hands
with a Mountie.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.888
And it said,
"Chinese and
Canadian cuisine".

38:11.890 --> 38:13.523
(Laughter)

38:16.461 --> 38:19.061
What do you think
a typical Canadian meal is?

38:19.063 --> 38:21.663
If I was to make you
a typical Canadian dinner,
Oh, jeez.

38:21.665 --> 38:23.064
what would it consist of?

38:23.066 --> 38:24.298
Um, beer.

38:24.300 --> 38:25.632
Some beer.

38:25.634 --> 38:26.899
Probably some good old
Canadian beer.

38:26.901 --> 38:28.133
Donuts and beer.

38:28.135 --> 38:29.467
Maple syrup, pancakes?

38:29.469 --> 38:30.734
Canadian bacon.

38:30.736 --> 38:32.102
Bacon and beer, hm.

38:32.104 --> 38:34.804
Canadian bacon
and maple syrup.
Seafood?

38:34.806 --> 38:36.572
Rob:
What about
beer and beer?

38:36.574 --> 38:38.307
Beer and beer? Yeah.

38:38.309 --> 38:40.142
Sure, different kind of beer,
and another kind of beer.

38:40.144 --> 38:41.476
It's a very subtle flavour.

38:41.478 --> 38:45.479
If America is
hamburgers and steak

38:45.481 --> 38:48.915
and if Mexico was salsa,
Canada is celery.

38:48.917 --> 38:50.149
We're from Canada,

38:50.151 --> 38:51.917
where mayonnaise
was considered a spice.

38:51.919 --> 38:54.085
My Canadian food is salmon.

38:54.087 --> 38:56.454
We'll take it fried,
barbequed, dried.

38:56.456 --> 38:58.489
To me, Canadian food
is like sushi,

38:58.491 --> 39:01.658
like, 'cause I'm from
Vancouver and there's
sushi everywhere.

39:01.660 --> 39:05.494
French fries with white vinegar
and ketchup and salt.

39:05.496 --> 39:06.761
Nom nom!

39:06.763 --> 39:08.095
Spaghetti and moose balls.

39:08.097 --> 39:09.796
Is that a family recipe?

39:09.798 --> 39:11.931
I don't know, it would go right
with my beaver tartar.

39:11.933 --> 39:15.701
I'll have a double portion of
beaver please, I'm from Canada.

39:15.703 --> 39:16.968
"Excuse me?"

39:16.970 --> 39:18.502
The exhibition,
years ago

39:18.504 --> 39:20.103
they had foods
of the world
that was a booth

39:20.105 --> 39:21.337
and they had,
you know,

39:21.339 --> 39:23.505
empañadas
and burritos

39:23.507 --> 39:24.772
from Mexico...
Burrito!

39:24.774 --> 39:26.006
and all these
different places,

39:26.008 --> 39:27.507
and like crepes
from France,

39:27.509 --> 39:30.276
and Canada had
snow cones
and hot dogs.

39:30.278 --> 39:31.510
(Laughter)

39:31.512 --> 39:32.944
That was the
designated...

39:32.946 --> 39:34.712
My husband and I would have
dinner parties.

39:34.714 --> 39:36.313
And I would always say,

39:36.315 --> 39:38.114
"Tonight we're serving
Canadian food,

39:38.116 --> 39:39.515
"we're eating Italian.

39:39.517 --> 39:40.949
"Tonight we're serving
Canadian food,

39:40.951 --> 39:42.617
we're eating Chinese."

39:42.619 --> 39:44.318
All immigrants
who actually
make that country

39:44.320 --> 39:46.320
so it's a mixture
of a lot of,

39:46.322 --> 39:47.487
uh, you know,

39:47.489 --> 39:50.323
some good
and some bad,
obviously.

39:50.325 --> 39:52.525
Rob: (Narrating)
This kind of national
wishy-washiness

39:52.527 --> 39:55.127
was only raising the volume
on the small voice of doubt

39:55.129 --> 39:58.530
beginning inside me about
proving Canada is not a joke.

39:58.532 --> 40:01.966
Between our vast and varied
native and immigrant population,

40:01.968 --> 40:05.969
how the F do we not have
one famous national dish?

40:05.971 --> 40:08.004
So again, I went to an expert.

40:08.006 --> 40:10.239
Hey, Rob, pleased
to meet you.
How's it going?

40:10.241 --> 40:11.506
Wonderful.
Thank you so much
for taking the time.

40:11.508 --> 40:12.740
My pleasure.
I appreciate it.

40:12.742 --> 40:14.174
I look forward
to it.

40:14.176 --> 40:15.542
Come on back
to my office.
Excellent.

40:15.544 --> 40:16.809
What is Canadian food?

40:16.811 --> 40:18.744
Is there a
Canadian cuisine?

40:18.746 --> 40:22.147
The chefs,
Canadian chefs,
just met recently

40:22.149 --> 40:24.349
for the first congress
of what is Canadian food,

40:24.351 --> 40:28.152
and what it was,
was completely
multicultural,

40:28.154 --> 40:30.354
and let's explore
and be open
to everything.

40:30.356 --> 40:33.390
And that's what
their forgone
conclusion was,

40:33.392 --> 40:34.891
is who knows
what mystery
will come

40:34.893 --> 40:36.225
but there's going to be
something local

40:36.227 --> 40:37.492
from each little area.

40:37.494 --> 40:39.160
But isn't that
sort of,

40:39.162 --> 40:40.761
one of the classic
Canadian moves

40:40.763 --> 40:43.363
is we don't
want to offend
any type of food

40:43.365 --> 40:44.997
so we're being
polite and saying,

40:44.999 --> 40:46.398
"You're all
Canadian food".
(Indistinct)

40:46.400 --> 40:48.366
"Of course green beans
you're Canadian food,"

40:48.368 --> 40:50.368
"Yes, apples,
come on in."

40:50.370 --> 40:51.669
We're this
giant country

40:51.671 --> 40:54.171
with all these great
ingredients available

40:54.173 --> 40:57.007
but we never seem
to have decided on

40:57.009 --> 40:59.009
what Canadian food is.
What's ours...

40:59.011 --> 41:01.011
Like, if I go
around the world
and say,

41:01.013 --> 41:02.779
"Tell me a typical
Canadian meal,"

41:02.781 --> 41:04.046
it would be this.
Basically, right?

41:04.048 --> 41:05.280
Mmm-hm, that's
what they remember.

41:05.282 --> 41:07.015
Well, the maple syrup,
people love

41:07.017 --> 41:09.183
and lets face it,
maple syrup is delicious.
Right.

41:09.185 --> 41:12.019
Absolutely delicious
and it's hard to get
in a lot of places.

41:12.021 --> 41:14.388
So is this,
this is basically
Canadian cuisine?

41:14.390 --> 41:15.889
Right.

41:15.891 --> 41:18.024
Um, well, I really,
really appreciate
your time

41:18.026 --> 41:19.258
and your knowledge.

41:19.260 --> 41:20.525
Cheers.

41:20.527 --> 41:22.793
(Piano music)

41:22.795 --> 41:26.029
I am always going to be
curious about a country

41:26.031 --> 41:29.598
that considers it to be an
appropriate wintertime activity

41:29.600 --> 41:31.800
to take maple syrup,

41:31.802 --> 41:34.402
pour it on snow,

41:34.404 --> 41:36.404
watch it freeze,

41:36.406 --> 41:37.638
break it,

41:37.640 --> 41:39.806
sell it and eat it.

41:39.808 --> 41:41.207
Rob:
If I was to put a glass

41:41.209 --> 41:42.608
of pure maple syrup
in front of you

41:42.610 --> 41:43.875
would you guys
drink it?

41:43.877 --> 41:45.276
(Mixed affirmative comments)
No...

41:45.278 --> 41:47.378
I'm a true Canadian,
I'll do it.

41:47.380 --> 41:48.212
I had some
maple syrup
this morning,

41:48.214 --> 41:49.446
it was delightful.

41:49.448 --> 41:50.413
Rob:
Just straight
maple syrup?

41:50.415 --> 41:51.747
Straight maple syrup.

41:51.749 --> 41:53.215
I drink it
from the bottle.

41:53.217 --> 41:55.050
Rob: (Narrating)
This was very interesting,

41:55.052 --> 41:58.420
if you find a crushing lack
of clarity interesting.

41:58.422 --> 42:01.222
It seemed like Canada claimed
a ton of foods as our own,

42:01.224 --> 42:03.424
but maple syrup kept popping up.

42:03.426 --> 42:05.626
Even on our money.

42:05.628 --> 42:07.427
But I perked up when I heard
that maple syrup

42:07.429 --> 42:10.430
is also responsible for an
exciting recent development

42:10.432 --> 42:14.066
in our previously-assumed
boring history.

42:14.068 --> 42:16.034
Can I get some important music
for this part, please?

42:19.839 --> 42:21.638
You know about
the maple syrup heist?

42:21.640 --> 42:23.239
What was the
maple syrup heist?

42:23.241 --> 42:25.641
Recently these
guys stole...

42:25.643 --> 42:27.409
I did hear something
about this.
Yeah.

42:27.411 --> 42:29.811
They stole like
$80,000 worth
of maple syrup.

42:29.813 --> 42:31.179
Yeah.

42:31.181 --> 42:33.447
Rob: (Narrating)
It was actually
18 million dollars,

42:33.449 --> 42:36.450
and is our Kennedy
assassination conspiracy,

42:36.452 --> 42:39.085
but this was an enigma
wrapped in a riddle

42:39.087 --> 42:41.654
wrapped in something
that dribbles out of a tree.

42:41.656 --> 42:45.257
And it happened
at a super-secret location

42:45.259 --> 42:48.093
deep in the Quebec
countryside.

42:48.095 --> 42:50.095
The United States has Fort Knox.

42:50.097 --> 42:52.464
London has
the World gold reserve.

42:52.466 --> 42:55.266
We have a maple syrup reserve.

42:55.268 --> 42:57.101
In case there's
a worldwide shortage,

42:57.103 --> 43:00.270
Canada stockpiles five years
of emergency syrup.

43:00.272 --> 43:02.105
And just like
those other facilities,

43:02.107 --> 43:05.874
ours also has multiple layers
of deadly, high-tech security.

43:07.677 --> 43:08.942
(Clapping hands)

43:08.944 --> 43:11.110
(Hinges creaking)

43:11.112 --> 43:12.344
<i> Bonjour.</i>

43:12.346 --> 43:13.611
<i> Bonjour.</i>

43:13.613 --> 43:17.348
Man: (Speaking in French)

43:23.289 --> 43:25.689
It's like
"Raiders of
the Lost Ark",

43:25.691 --> 43:27.123
with maple syrup.

43:27.125 --> 43:29.358
(In French)

43:31.328 --> 43:34.128
Rob:
Most people think of Canada,
they think of maple syrup.

43:34.130 --> 43:37.064
Why do you think maple syrup
is so Canadian?

43:37.066 --> 43:40.734
(In French)

43:48.142 --> 43:51.143
One of the darkest days
in Canadian history,

43:51.145 --> 43:52.978
there was a big theft

43:52.980 --> 43:55.914
of millions of dollars
worth of maple syrup.
Yeah, yeah.

43:55.916 --> 43:57.315
So, can you explain
what happened?

43:57.317 --> 43:58.716
(Eerie music)

43:58.718 --> 44:01.218
(Speaking in French)

44:25.943 --> 44:28.443
(Continues in French)

44:34.951 --> 44:37.451
(Speaking French)

44:40.956 --> 44:42.755
Rob: (Narrating)
That may be the craziest
story I've heard

44:42.757 --> 44:46.191
since the doctor found a vagina
on my baby x-rays.

44:46.193 --> 44:48.560
But I still had
more stereotypes to smash

44:48.562 --> 44:49.794
and got back on the road,

44:49.796 --> 44:52.563
with only six days
left until Canada Day.

44:52.565 --> 44:54.965
( ¶¶ )

44:54.967 --> 44:56.967
But in typical Canadian fashion,

44:56.969 --> 44:59.369
moments after I crossed
the provincial border

44:59.371 --> 45:01.371
the weather took a nasty turn.

45:01.373 --> 45:02.805
I'd grown up with this climate,

45:02.807 --> 45:04.573
so it wasn't going
to stop my quest.

45:04.575 --> 45:06.975
And it was certainly not
going to stop hearty locals

45:06.977 --> 45:09.110
from going about
their daily routines.

45:09.112 --> 45:11.078
Like nice strolls
through the park,

45:11.080 --> 45:12.913
people headed to work,

45:12.915 --> 45:15.081
folks visiting
the local gallery,

45:15.083 --> 45:17.049
or shopping
at the local supermarket.

45:17.051 --> 45:19.418
<i> Vive le Canada!</i>
<i> Vive le Canada!</i>
<i> Ouais!</i>

45:19.420 --> 45:21.620
Rob:
Ontario is home to
our nation's capital,

45:21.622 --> 45:23.088
and was the perfect
place for me

45:23.090 --> 45:24.989
to dust off
my old winter skills...

45:24.991 --> 45:33.663
( ¶¶ )

45:33.665 --> 45:35.064
(Mixed grunting, shouting)

45:35.066 --> 45:36.665
Are you all right?
Child:
(Crying)

45:36.667 --> 45:38.100
I'm so sorry.

45:38.102 --> 45:39.801
Rob:
...and get into
my next question.

45:43.906 --> 45:45.772
I marvel in the wintertime

45:45.774 --> 45:49.942
at how the pioneers
could possibly have done it.

45:49.944 --> 45:52.911
Didn't anybody tell them
that they could just turn left

45:52.913 --> 45:54.379
and be in the sunshine?

45:54.381 --> 45:58.716
Just a couple more days
by wagon or canoe

45:58.718 --> 46:00.784
and you're in Phoenix.

46:00.786 --> 46:03.887
You know, we'd
like to be, you know,
culturally sensitive,

46:03.889 --> 46:05.521
but you got to wonder,

46:05.523 --> 46:07.222
what the fuck
were they thinking?

46:07.224 --> 46:09.357
They come across
the land bridge

46:09.359 --> 46:10.891
and there's just ice and snow

46:10.893 --> 46:13.059
and nothing much to eat
except seals.

46:13.061 --> 46:15.861
And they go,
"This is a nice place.

46:15.863 --> 46:18.129
"I know we were
just in Africa,

46:18.131 --> 46:20.798
but this
seems nice."
Right. I'm tired.

46:20.800 --> 46:22.132
Bubbles:
Guys came over,

46:22.134 --> 46:23.933
suffered through
some harsh winters,

46:23.935 --> 46:26.302
got fucking scurvy,
dirty scurvy...

46:26.304 --> 46:28.370
I've had scurvy.

46:28.372 --> 46:29.604
People came out
to the prairies,

46:29.606 --> 46:31.405
they got these land grants.

46:31.407 --> 46:33.774
"Hoo-ha! Here we are,
we're coming from oppression,

46:33.776 --> 46:35.408
"and there they are.
Yeah, there's land, honey,

46:35.410 --> 46:36.642
but there ain't anything else."

46:36.644 --> 46:38.276
And they built these sod huts.

46:38.278 --> 46:41.746
And the women were...
went crazy out of isolation.

46:41.748 --> 46:45.449
Canada was a country created
by a lot of very lonely people

46:45.451 --> 46:48.418
you know, clinging,
you know, very precariously

46:48.420 --> 46:49.819
to their sanity.

46:49.821 --> 46:52.288
(Laughing)
Like, they're a people

46:52.290 --> 46:54.823
who just fucking
gave up too soon.
Right.

46:54.825 --> 46:57.392
Environment Canada has issued
severe weather warnings.

46:57.394 --> 46:59.961
Newcaster:
In Toronto, a sheet of ice
coated the city last night.

46:59.963 --> 47:02.163
Entire streets were turned
into ice rinks.

47:02.165 --> 47:05.399
I was walking maybe
an eighth of a mile

47:05.401 --> 47:08.101
and it was 60 below,
24-hour darkness,

47:08.103 --> 47:09.602
and I was going
to a friend's place.

47:09.604 --> 47:14.472
It was like the coldest
winter since 1928.

47:14.474 --> 47:18.342
I walked out the door
and I puked the whole way.

47:18.344 --> 47:20.977
You know that
you're moving forward,

47:20.979 --> 47:22.745
but you're paralyzed,

47:22.747 --> 47:24.913
but you're like, "My body
is still doing this stuff,

47:24.915 --> 47:26.948
but like, I don't know
how it's doing this."

47:26.950 --> 47:28.482
I've been stranded
many times

47:28.484 --> 47:30.350
in the middle
of nowhere,
Right.

47:30.352 --> 47:32.085
no cell phone
'cause it's frozen,

47:32.087 --> 47:34.854
freezing my butt
off, thinking I
was going to die,

47:34.856 --> 47:37.156
and it's happened
more than at least
three or four times.

47:37.158 --> 47:38.457
Wow.

47:38.459 --> 47:40.492
I must admit,
I did get nostalgic

47:40.494 --> 47:42.093
hearing all these comments.

47:42.095 --> 47:44.862
However, I felt something
alarming inside.

47:44.864 --> 47:46.763
Not gas from the poutine.

47:46.765 --> 47:48.197
It was a bubble of concern

47:48.199 --> 47:49.765
that I was three days
into my trip

47:49.767 --> 47:51.967
and defining what it means
being Canadian,

47:51.969 --> 47:54.269
was a bigger job
than I first suspected.

47:54.271 --> 47:56.638
But if there was anyone
in my homeland

47:56.640 --> 47:58.172
who could give me
a little help,

47:58.174 --> 47:59.840
it was the guy
who runs the place.

47:59.842 --> 48:02.375
So I swung by
the Prime Minister's house,

48:02.377 --> 48:05.444
and was told by his strangely
upbeat security detail

48:05.446 --> 48:08.847
that the PM was out
buying snow tires.

48:08.849 --> 48:10.949
I asked the guards
how they remain so positive

48:10.951 --> 48:12.283
standing in the bitter cold,

48:12.285 --> 48:13.884
and they said everyone
deals with the weather

48:13.886 --> 48:15.452
in their own unique way.

48:15.454 --> 48:17.887
Which was perfect
because it led me perfectly

48:17.889 --> 48:19.021
to my next question.

48:22.526 --> 48:23.791
When you're
stuck inside

48:23.793 --> 48:25.726
six months out
of the year, eh,

48:25.728 --> 48:27.728
you just kind of
go a little crazy.

48:27.730 --> 48:29.563
The cold will do things
to your head.

48:29.565 --> 48:32.132
You will start
to have weird thoughts,

48:32.134 --> 48:35.201
and it depends on how
you harness those thoughts.

48:35.203 --> 48:36.802
And I think a lot of comics

48:36.804 --> 48:38.470
are people that were
very bored in the winter,

48:38.472 --> 48:41.306
who took those thoughts
and went on stage with them.

48:41.308 --> 48:43.007
It's so fucking cold there

48:43.009 --> 48:44.808
that I think that you do have
to think of something.

48:44.810 --> 48:47.710
On your way home
with your tears that are
frozen onto your face

48:47.712 --> 48:49.478
and there's a dead animal
that's strapped around you

48:49.480 --> 48:52.814
and you're only six...
I think that at
some point you go,

48:52.816 --> 48:54.715
"God, there's got to be
something better than this!

48:54.717 --> 48:56.083
"Ooh, I just thought
of something funny.

48:56.085 --> 48:57.384
That'll cheer me up
for a minute."

48:57.386 --> 48:58.985
They say heat
kills comedy, right?

48:58.987 --> 49:00.519
And then, and uh...

49:00.521 --> 49:01.753
There's no heat
in Canada.

49:01.755 --> 49:03.554
There's no heat
in Canada...

49:03.556 --> 49:05.656
Letterman studios
are notoriously
freezing cold,

49:05.658 --> 49:07.224
Well, that's just
because he's trying
to emulate Canada.

49:07.226 --> 49:08.592
Rob:
Right.

49:08.594 --> 49:10.260
It's hard to be serious
with a toque.

49:10.262 --> 49:11.494
Can I get a toque?

49:13.598 --> 49:14.997
I'm serious here.

49:14.999 --> 49:17.165
Even saying that, you know?
Don't...

49:17.167 --> 49:19.100
Don't, don't look at me
like that.

49:19.102 --> 49:20.701
Don't... hey...

49:20.703 --> 49:22.035
hey, don't...

49:22.037 --> 49:23.336
don't look at me like that,

49:23.338 --> 49:24.904
I am serious here.

49:24.906 --> 49:26.906
In Norway and in Sweden,

49:26.908 --> 49:28.908
they have the same
brutal winters we have

49:28.910 --> 49:30.276
and they come up
with death metal.

49:30.278 --> 49:33.379
And in Canada,
we come up with comedy.

49:33.381 --> 49:35.714
Please. Please. Don't...

49:35.716 --> 49:38.116
This is not funny.
This is not funny.

49:38.118 --> 49:39.750
I am being serious.

49:39.752 --> 49:41.618
Rob:
Yes, comedy.

49:41.620 --> 49:44.020
It goes without question
that Canada is home

49:44.022 --> 49:46.288
to some of the greatest
comedic minds of our time.

49:46.290 --> 49:48.590
"SCTV", "Wayne and Shuster",

49:48.592 --> 49:50.291
Jim Carrey,
"Kids in the Hall",

49:50.293 --> 49:52.126
Lorne Michaels, Mike Myers,

49:52.128 --> 49:53.427
Seth Rogen.

49:53.429 --> 49:55.462
I can safely say that,
per capita,

49:55.464 --> 49:57.764
Canada is the largest
supplier of comedy

49:57.766 --> 50:00.366
that has ever lived.
And looking back,

50:00.368 --> 50:01.800
I realize
how my place of birth

50:01.802 --> 50:04.202
may also be responsible
for my chosen career.

50:04.204 --> 50:05.803
So I drove into Toronto,

50:05.805 --> 50:08.238
the mecca of Canadian comedy.

50:08.240 --> 50:10.440
It's where I went to
my very first comedy club,

50:10.442 --> 50:12.809
and may also hold the answer
to another question

50:12.811 --> 50:15.178
people are eternally asking.

50:19.984 --> 50:21.583
I think the average
kid grew up

50:21.585 --> 50:24.085
with a mix of the British
and a mix of the...

50:24.087 --> 50:27.655
of the U.S. to make
an all-rounded view of comedy

50:27.657 --> 50:30.924
and one which stressed satire,
political and social,

50:30.926 --> 50:33.893
and an observant kind of view
of the rest of the world.

50:33.895 --> 50:36.061
You know that's the
thing, we had access
to all this stuff.

50:36.063 --> 50:38.396
And I also think the British
thing was a big piece of it.

50:38.398 --> 50:41.932
Clever guys like Wayne and
Shuster, on Canadian radio,

50:41.934 --> 50:44.501
created a kind of
national sense of humour,

50:44.503 --> 50:46.002
or contributed anyway.

50:46.004 --> 50:47.303
There's a definite preference

50:47.305 --> 50:48.971
for low-status
sort of characters.

50:48.973 --> 50:50.672
I always think of John Candy

50:50.674 --> 50:52.340
or some of Dan Ackroyd's
characters,

50:52.342 --> 50:55.443
or these big, broad,
misbehaving sort of characters,

50:55.445 --> 50:58.245
but they're also likeable,
so that's partly Canadian.

50:58.247 --> 51:00.080
We're pleasant individuals,

51:00.082 --> 51:05.985
so most of our humour
is... non-threatening.

51:05.987 --> 51:09.822
It's funny
without being nasty.

51:09.824 --> 51:11.857
Damn, that's good tag line
right there.

51:11.859 --> 51:14.426
It's not humour at the cost
of other people,

51:14.428 --> 51:15.927
it's humour at the cost
of yourself.

51:15.929 --> 51:17.128
Rob:
Right.

51:17.130 --> 51:19.196
Which is the core
of self-deprecation,

51:19.198 --> 51:20.764
which is my favourite.

51:20.766 --> 51:24.033
Canadians have a much
better sense of humour

51:24.035 --> 51:26.135
about themselves
than Americans,

51:26.137 --> 51:28.036
hands down.

51:28.038 --> 51:29.971
I've gone to
comedy clubs where
people are talking...

51:29.973 --> 51:31.505
you know, Canadian
themed comedy clubs,

51:31.507 --> 51:33.540
where everybody
is talking about
how lame we are,

51:33.542 --> 51:35.642
you know, and how
lame our army is

51:35.644 --> 51:38.111
and how lame our
national symbols are

51:38.113 --> 51:40.179
and that sort of thing.
And it's like, "Wow ."

51:40.181 --> 51:42.014
You really walk
out of there going,
"Wow, we suck."

51:42.016 --> 51:44.616
Every Canadian kind of
has an underdog status.

51:44.618 --> 51:46.784
I think that kind of gives us
our funny edge too,

51:46.786 --> 51:49.319
'cause we're always
looking to see...

51:49.321 --> 51:51.120
You know, we're the underdog
and we're fighting back,

51:51.122 --> 51:52.855
and we want to, you know,
make fun of the big guy.

51:52.857 --> 51:55.357
It's something that
we get to comment on

51:55.359 --> 51:57.359
because we're not in it.

51:57.361 --> 52:01.362
We're... you know,
we're the... outsider.

52:01.364 --> 52:03.197
From a comedian's
point of view,

52:03.199 --> 52:05.899
if you have a touch
of outsider in you,
it's going to help.

52:05.901 --> 52:08.234
That's why Jewish comedians,

52:08.236 --> 52:09.969
Black comedians,
Hispanic comedians,

52:09.971 --> 52:11.804
they have an advantage.
They're a minority,

52:11.806 --> 52:13.372
they're looking at
the country differently;

52:13.374 --> 52:14.706
there's not total acceptance.

52:14.708 --> 52:17.241
If you think
about school yards,

52:17.243 --> 52:20.344
you're either
the handsome one,

52:20.346 --> 52:22.479
the tough one,

52:22.481 --> 52:25.815
or the funny one who's trying
to be funny to stay alive.

52:25.817 --> 52:27.983
We are this group of people

52:27.985 --> 52:30.518
who have been suffering
under the shadow

52:30.520 --> 52:34.354
of this enormous belligerent,
obnoxious neighbour.

52:34.356 --> 52:36.155
And how do we
get back at them?

52:36.157 --> 52:39.991
You know every culture reacts
to another dominant culture

52:39.993 --> 52:42.393
by sending the signal back,

52:42.395 --> 52:45.095
and so the Canadians were
absorbing American television,

52:45.097 --> 52:48.064
American politics,
and so they send it back.

52:48.066 --> 52:49.765
It's like a Canadian sponge

52:49.767 --> 52:53.568
that sops up
all the American paint,

52:53.570 --> 52:57.205
and then throws it back
in our face

52:57.207 --> 52:59.006
and says, "Happy new year."

52:59.008 --> 53:03.276
We have struck back at this
monstrous neighbor of ours

53:03.278 --> 53:07.112
through this kind of covert
hostility: humour.

53:07.114 --> 53:09.714
Rob:
As I continued
my mission west

53:09.716 --> 53:11.816
into Manitoba, Saskatchewan

53:11.818 --> 53:13.484
and the Great Canadian Prairies,

53:13.486 --> 53:15.319
it suddenly dawned on me:

53:15.321 --> 53:17.888
I use that exact same feeling
of being an outsider

53:17.890 --> 53:19.356
as a comedy writer.

53:19.358 --> 53:21.224
Maybe that was
the whole point.

53:21.226 --> 53:22.792
Being misunderstood
the world over

53:22.794 --> 53:26.162
fueled a kind of secret
Canadian super power.

53:26.164 --> 53:27.796
And Canada's comedic greatness

53:27.798 --> 53:30.165
isn't just limited
to TV and movies.

53:30.167 --> 53:31.799
Our special sense of humor

53:31.801 --> 53:34.735
is also woven into the fabric
of our favorite sports.

53:34.737 --> 53:36.069
Don't look so confused,

53:36.071 --> 53:38.204
because I now
present exhibit A:

53:38.206 --> 53:39.471
curling.

53:39.473 --> 53:40.839
Man:
I very frankly wish

53:40.841 --> 53:42.740
we hadn't made
curling so popular,

53:42.742 --> 53:44.475
because if you're Canada

53:44.477 --> 53:47.077
and you're looking for
a little bit more elbow room

53:47.079 --> 53:48.745
on the world stage,

53:48.747 --> 53:51.848
curling is not the
best representation.

53:51.850 --> 53:53.416
For anyone actually.

53:53.418 --> 53:55.584
Rob:
Curling almost embodies
Canada perfectly

53:55.586 --> 53:58.553
because it is cold,
and polite, and boring.

53:58.555 --> 53:59.820
Absolutely.

53:59.822 --> 54:02.689
Curling is symbolic
of Canada

54:02.691 --> 54:04.357
in such an incredible way.

54:04.359 --> 54:05.991
I couldn't agree with
you more. It's perfect.

54:05.993 --> 54:08.693
Rob:
And exhibit B: hockey.

54:08.695 --> 54:11.062
Playing hockey, that is
truly a shared experience

54:11.064 --> 54:12.329
with all Canadians.

54:12.331 --> 54:14.531
Tough and cool.
Look at hockey fighting.

54:14.533 --> 54:16.332
They fight each other,
but they have respect
for each other.

54:16.334 --> 54:18.267
I saw a fight
the other night on CBC,

54:18.269 --> 54:20.369
and the guy was wearing
a visor and he said
to the other guy,

54:20.371 --> 54:22.437
"Hang on, give me a second
so I can take my helmet off."

54:22.439 --> 54:25.206
And he gave him a second,
and then they went into it.

54:25.208 --> 54:26.840
That's fucking awesome.

54:26.842 --> 54:28.875
Rob:
And exhibit C, and
my favorite of all:

54:28.877 --> 54:31.277
The Canadian Football League.

54:31.279 --> 54:33.078
My biggest thrill as a kid

54:33.080 --> 54:35.713
was going to
Calgary Stampeders games
with my dad and brothers,

54:35.715 --> 54:38.849
sitting on the 55 yard line
in the freezing cold.

54:38.851 --> 54:41.318
However, even back then,
I asked...

54:46.224 --> 54:49.058
I'm speaking, of course,
about the Rough Riders,

54:49.060 --> 54:50.759
and the Roughriders.

54:50.761 --> 54:53.394
They even played each other
and no one said anything!

54:53.396 --> 54:54.628
(Laughter)

54:54.630 --> 54:56.029
You know,
that's fantastic.

54:56.031 --> 54:57.363
(Sigh)
So sad.

54:57.365 --> 54:58.964
How did that happen?
I want to know.

54:58.966 --> 55:00.398
Like, really?

55:00.400 --> 55:02.466
As creative a people we are...

55:02.468 --> 55:04.434
we couldn't figure
this one out?

55:04.436 --> 55:06.369
Well, one was
Roughriders and one
was the Rough Riders,

55:06.371 --> 55:07.937
and if you can't
figure that out,

55:07.939 --> 55:09.371
if you can't tell
the difference
between the two,

55:09.373 --> 55:10.705
then there
is something
wrong with you.

55:10.707 --> 55:12.606
It's the Canadian quest
for efficiency.

55:12.608 --> 55:15.542
So... Because
it's the same name

55:15.544 --> 55:17.143
and you can use it
in each conference.

55:17.145 --> 55:18.944
(Laughter)

55:18.946 --> 55:22.547
That, look... I mean,
doesn't that say it all?

55:22.549 --> 55:24.715
I mean, in this kind
of a country,

55:24.717 --> 55:26.650
you can have two teams
with the same name

55:26.652 --> 55:28.918
and people listening
to the game know who
they're talking about.

55:28.920 --> 55:30.152
This is lunacy.

55:30.154 --> 55:32.287
That speaks to our politeness.

55:32.289 --> 55:33.655
That speaks to, you know...

55:33.657 --> 55:35.423
It's like having kids, okay?

55:35.425 --> 55:37.324
Say you had nine kids.

55:37.326 --> 55:42.061
You know, Bobby, Timmy,
Sally, Mike, Phil...

55:42.063 --> 55:43.762
Whatever, you get the idea.

55:43.764 --> 55:45.497
And one of the
other kids says,

55:45.499 --> 55:48.433
"Well, I like his name, Phil.
Why can't I be Phil?"

55:48.435 --> 55:50.601
In America, they go,
"No, because you're Sandy,

55:50.603 --> 55:52.002
you can't be Phil."

55:52.004 --> 55:53.903
In Canada, we go,
"You like 'Phil'?

55:53.905 --> 55:56.338
I want you to be happy.
You're Phil too."

55:56.340 --> 55:59.174
Rob:
So who is responsible
for such madness?

55:59.176 --> 56:01.309
Let's ask this guy.

56:01.311 --> 56:03.911
Ah... you know it's funny,
I mean, this goes back...

56:03.913 --> 56:06.980
So in 1898,
the Ottawa rugby team,

56:06.982 --> 56:08.614
which eventually became
the football club,

56:08.616 --> 56:09.848
was named the Rough Riders.

56:09.850 --> 56:11.783
They played a really
tough, violent game.

56:11.785 --> 56:13.684
and a "Hamilton Spectator"
reporter

56:13.686 --> 56:15.285
ended up calling them
the "Rough Riders".

56:15.287 --> 56:17.487
And then in, like, 1924,

56:17.489 --> 56:20.490
the rugby team in Regina
were named the Roughriders

56:20.492 --> 56:24.460
because the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police had their
training headquarters

56:24.462 --> 56:25.694
right near the rugby field,

56:25.696 --> 56:27.162
and they became
the Roughriders as well.

56:27.164 --> 56:30.298
Those two leagues merged,
then they got two teams.

56:30.300 --> 56:32.433
In such a big country,
I don't think they knew...

56:32.435 --> 56:34.501
You know, it took...
canoe and...

56:34.503 --> 56:36.369
Listen, we spell them
a little bit differently:

56:36.371 --> 56:38.037
one is "Roughriders",
one word,

56:38.039 --> 56:40.205
the other is
"Rough Riders", so...

56:40.207 --> 56:42.173
Rob:
That seems to make sense...

56:42.175 --> 56:44.642
in a Canadian sort of way.

56:44.644 --> 56:47.111
But as Saskatchewan filled
my rear view mirror,

56:47.113 --> 56:50.614
that voice of doubt from
before was getting louder.

56:50.616 --> 56:52.682
I was more than halfway
through my journey

56:52.684 --> 56:54.450
and still didn't feel

56:54.452 --> 56:57.019
like I clearly defined
what it means to be Canadian.

56:57.021 --> 56:59.021
I needed a quick
little pick-me-up,

56:59.023 --> 57:01.156
and knew exactly
what would do the trick.

57:39.756 --> 57:42.156
(Audience applause)

57:42.158 --> 57:44.725
Rob:
Was that the most bad-ass
thing you've ever seen?

57:44.727 --> 57:47.027
Let me answer for you: yes!

57:47.029 --> 57:49.329
Re-energized, I drove on.

57:49.331 --> 57:51.030
But unlike all of
the amazing places

57:51.032 --> 57:52.531
I'd passed through
on this trip,

57:52.533 --> 57:54.666
this next one
was truly special...

57:54.668 --> 57:56.868
because it was my home.

57:56.870 --> 57:59.103
I love Canada,

57:59.105 --> 58:01.271
but I really love Alberta.

58:01.273 --> 58:03.406
And as I crossed
the provincial border,

58:03.408 --> 58:05.775
that annoying little
voice quieted down,

58:05.777 --> 58:08.844
and I smiled
because a few miles ahead

58:08.846 --> 58:11.947
lay my hometown of Calgary.

58:11.949 --> 58:15.417
(Triumphant ¶¶)

58:15.419 --> 58:17.585
Calgary started out as
a rough and tumble town.

58:17.587 --> 58:20.354
It was one of the RCMP's
most dangerous outposts,

58:20.356 --> 58:22.189
has a cool Old West history,

58:22.191 --> 58:23.623
and is also known as the home

58:23.625 --> 58:25.791
to the world famous
Calgary Stampede,

58:25.793 --> 58:28.226
"the greatest
outdoor show on earth".

58:28.228 --> 58:30.695
Part huge state fair
and part giant rodeo

58:30.697 --> 58:32.396
and part awesome.

58:32.398 --> 58:34.464
It helped put my hometown
on the map.

58:34.466 --> 58:36.866
Calgary's symbol is
a white cowboy hat,

58:36.868 --> 58:38.734
and when important visitors
arrive there,

58:38.736 --> 58:40.302
they get white-hatted,

58:40.304 --> 58:42.304
custom made by Smithbilt.

58:42.306 --> 58:44.739
I always thought
those hats were so cool,

58:44.741 --> 58:47.541
but since I grew up there,
I never qualified.

58:47.543 --> 58:50.744
My dad would bring home
substitute hats for
my brothers and I,

58:50.746 --> 58:52.746
and I'd dream of striding
through the prairie

58:52.748 --> 58:55.281
like a Canadian Clint Eastwood.

58:55.283 --> 58:57.716
Then, in a weird coincidence,

58:57.718 --> 58:59.451
my aunt told me how
my father used to work

58:59.453 --> 59:02.053
as a salesman for Smithbilt
as a young man.

59:02.055 --> 59:03.487
I never knew this.

59:03.489 --> 59:04.754
So I took a shot,

59:04.756 --> 59:06.922
and they said, "Come on over."

59:06.924 --> 59:08.757
Thanks a lot.
No problem.

59:08.759 --> 59:11.159
Brian Hansen.
How's it going?
Rob.

59:11.161 --> 59:13.828
I couldn't believe
I was actually here.

59:16.899 --> 59:18.164
Ooh...

59:18.166 --> 59:19.398
Yeah, exactly.

59:22.803 --> 59:25.436
All right,
so just a warning

59:25.438 --> 59:27.171
to all the ladies
out there: calm down.

59:27.173 --> 59:28.639
(Chuckling)

59:28.641 --> 59:30.674
Oh... You know what,

59:30.676 --> 59:32.909
I think we're going
to have to start
with a smaller one.

59:32.911 --> 59:34.510
Have I ever looked cooler?

59:37.181 --> 59:38.446
There we go.

59:38.448 --> 59:40.281
Rob:
40 years later,

59:40.283 --> 59:41.915
I got to cross one more
thing off my bucket list.

59:41.917 --> 59:47.519
(Western music)

59:47.521 --> 59:50.321
(Coyote howling)

59:50.323 --> 59:52.022
(Whip cracking)

59:53.992 --> 59:56.359
Man:
So Rob, where are we right now?

59:56.361 --> 59:59.161
We are in Haysboro, Calgary,

59:59.163 --> 1:00:01.296
which is my old neighborhood.

1:00:01.298 --> 1:00:05.767
And we are going to the house
that I first grew up in.

1:00:05.769 --> 1:00:07.702
I loved this house.

1:00:07.704 --> 1:00:09.270
Right down the street

1:00:09.272 --> 1:00:11.038
was where my ill-fated
toboggan jump took place.

1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:12.806
And it's also where,

1:00:12.808 --> 1:00:14.607
as a little boy in
the darkened basement,

1:00:14.609 --> 1:00:16.875
I had my first experience
with something...

1:00:16.877 --> 1:00:18.476
incredibly strange.

1:00:18.478 --> 1:00:20.277
It would happen every night,

1:00:20.279 --> 1:00:22.779
and only got worse as
the years progressed.

1:00:22.781 --> 1:00:25.982
So, I decided to use
this opportunity

1:00:25.984 --> 1:00:27.950
to finally confront
the question:

1:00:32.122 --> 1:00:34.388
I used to, you know,
flipping around channels,

1:00:34.390 --> 1:00:37.724
would be able to
spot a Canadian show
in a second

1:00:37.726 --> 1:00:40.093
just because it wasn't lit well.

1:00:40.095 --> 1:00:42.662
Uhh, you know, why don't
they light the person's face?

1:00:42.664 --> 1:00:45.564
Every time you watched
a Canadian drama, growing up,

1:00:45.566 --> 1:00:48.400
you could always tell it was
Canadian 'cause somebody
forgot to turn the lights on,

1:00:48.402 --> 1:00:50.268
and then you realize,
"Oh wait that's
just their lighting."

1:00:50.270 --> 1:00:53.904
Larry Henderson...

1:00:53.906 --> 1:00:56.406
some guy with a big moustache,

1:00:56.408 --> 1:00:58.107
you know, delivering the news.

1:00:58.109 --> 1:01:01.243
If he was talking about
a bank robbery downtown,

1:01:01.245 --> 1:01:04.613
on the little board
behind his head,

1:01:04.615 --> 1:01:06.948
they would have
a line drawing

1:01:06.950 --> 1:01:09.016
of a crook with a mask on,

1:01:09.018 --> 1:01:11.284
holding a bag with
a money sign on it,

1:01:11.286 --> 1:01:13.319
you know, like...

1:01:13.321 --> 1:01:16.322
And I'm watching news
on other stations,

1:01:16.324 --> 1:01:18.157
you know, out of Buffalo,

1:01:18.159 --> 1:01:21.927
and I'm not seeing
this kind of thing

1:01:21.929 --> 1:01:23.528
on the broadcast.

1:01:23.530 --> 1:01:25.763
Al Waxman was
always the giveaway.

1:01:25.765 --> 1:01:27.498
When Al Waxman is the mayor
of your American city,

1:01:27.500 --> 1:01:29.132
you know you're
in a Canadian film.

1:01:29.134 --> 1:01:31.033
Right. Or Al Waxman is Lincoln.

1:01:31.035 --> 1:01:34.669
Ex...
(Laughing)

1:01:34.671 --> 1:01:36.303
They don't try to glam it up.

1:01:36.305 --> 1:01:38.171
If anything they're
trying to say, "Look,

1:01:38.173 --> 1:01:41.340
"we're making this show,
it's not any better than you.

1:01:41.342 --> 1:01:43.141
We're not saying that
we're any better than you."

1:01:43.143 --> 1:01:45.042
I was so excited about
"The Littlest Hobo".

1:01:45.044 --> 1:01:47.778
¶ There's a voice,
keeps on calling me ¶

1:01:47.780 --> 1:01:49.479
(Laughing)
No one's ever said that

1:01:49.481 --> 1:01:50.780
No.
in the history of man.

1:01:50.782 --> 1:01:52.648
That's why I'm recording this.

1:01:52.650 --> 1:01:55.117
That's the most original
sentence ever said.

1:01:55.119 --> 1:01:57.185
Rob:
And you can't
discuss Canadian TV

1:01:57.187 --> 1:01:59.153
without mentioning
its crown jewel,

1:01:59.155 --> 1:02:00.787
"The Beachcombers".

1:02:00.789 --> 1:02:02.855
I loved "The Beachcombers".
I did too.

1:02:02.857 --> 1:02:05.624
I think I had some,
like, sexual attraction
to Bruno Gerussi.

1:02:05.626 --> 1:02:07.325
You can't explain
"The Beachcombers".

1:02:07.327 --> 1:02:08.993
(Laughter)
It's a state
of mind, man.

1:02:08.995 --> 1:02:10.828
How would you pitch me
"The Beachcombers"?

1:02:10.830 --> 1:02:16.466
Umm...
(Theme music)

1:02:16.468 --> 1:02:18.134
Okay, we've got
an idea for a show.
Okay.

1:02:18.136 --> 1:02:20.136
It takes place on
Vancouver Island.
Nice.

1:02:20.138 --> 1:02:22.538
You got two rival
beachcombers.

1:02:22.540 --> 1:02:25.908
Like an older, Greek man...

1:02:25.910 --> 1:02:28.810
...having a mid-life crisis

1:02:28.812 --> 1:02:31.579
who collects wood,
from the beach.
(Laugh)

1:02:31.581 --> 1:02:33.514
And he's got
a nemesis, named Relic,

1:02:33.516 --> 1:02:36.850
that'll do anything to you
to not let you get the logs.

1:02:36.852 --> 1:02:38.585
Dave Foley:
But, they still
have lunch together.

1:02:38.587 --> 1:02:41.521
At a little place run by
a lovable middle aged lady,

1:02:41.523 --> 1:02:44.323
who you can imagine
at some point had
some sexuality.

1:02:44.325 --> 1:02:46.692
The nemesis is the,
are the gentle waters

1:02:46.694 --> 1:02:49.361
off the coast of
British Columbia.
That's your villain.

1:02:49.363 --> 1:02:52.664
Every week there's
a new thing happening.

1:02:52.666 --> 1:02:54.499
You never quite know
what's going to happen.

1:02:54.501 --> 1:02:56.701
Is it different
logs every week?

1:02:56.703 --> 1:02:58.769
Or is it one log in the
course of the series?
There is one problem log.

1:02:58.771 --> 1:03:00.036
He's a drifter.

1:03:00.038 --> 1:03:01.437
Sold, let's shoot it.

1:03:01.439 --> 1:03:02.771
I want to be at that pitch.

1:03:02.773 --> 1:03:04.405
That thing ran for 20 years!

1:03:04.407 --> 1:03:05.906
20...<i> 22</i> years!
Yeah.

1:03:05.908 --> 1:03:08.375
20 years
"The Beachcombers" was on?

1:03:08.377 --> 1:03:10.443
It's our "Gunsmoke".
Yeah, exactly.
Right.

1:03:10.445 --> 1:03:12.578
That's perfect.
If you go,

1:03:12.580 --> 1:03:14.513
"Would you rather
watch "Gunsmoke" or
"The Beachcombers",

1:03:14.515 --> 1:03:16.515
most people would
rather watch "Gunsmoke".
Right.

1:03:16.517 --> 1:03:19.017
I would rather
watch "Gunsmoke".
Yeah, me too.

1:03:19.019 --> 1:03:21.185
But I used to watch it
religiously.

1:03:21.187 --> 1:03:22.286
Rob:
Now, why did you
watch it?

1:03:22.288 --> 1:03:23.453
I don't know why.

1:03:23.455 --> 1:03:25.354
I think we just
got into the
mode in Canada

1:03:25.356 --> 1:03:27.122
where we didn't
even question it.

1:03:27.124 --> 1:03:28.923
It's like, "Oh yeah,
it's the 'Beachcombers'.

1:03:28.925 --> 1:03:31.625
It's crap and provincial,
but it's on every night."

1:03:31.627 --> 1:03:34.294
It's like a bad relationship,
you know, you're drawn to it.

1:03:34.296 --> 1:03:35.662
You can't get out
of it sometimes.

1:03:37.465 --> 1:03:38.864
Rob:
There was another important
element to Calgary

1:03:38.866 --> 1:03:40.131
that affected this film.

1:03:40.133 --> 1:03:41.732
Because we had the Stampede,

1:03:41.734 --> 1:03:43.467
American relatives
would come visit us

1:03:43.469 --> 1:03:45.068
and they would
speak of Canadians

1:03:45.070 --> 1:03:46.969
as though we were their pets.

1:03:46.971 --> 1:03:49.905
It made me nuts because
I found myself torn

1:03:49.907 --> 1:03:51.973
between how
condescending they were

1:03:51.975 --> 1:03:54.875
and how I admired America's
genuine awesomeness.

1:03:54.877 --> 1:03:57.611
We had the "Beachcombers"
and "The Friendly Giant".

1:03:57.613 --> 1:03:59.813
They had
"The Six Million Dollar Man"

1:03:59.815 --> 1:04:01.581
and "Starsky and Hutch".

1:04:01.583 --> 1:04:02.882
So I need to ask...

1:04:07.955 --> 1:04:09.754
A friend of mine used
to describe Canada

1:04:09.756 --> 1:04:12.923
as the "Hey, guys, wait up!"
country to the United States.

1:04:12.925 --> 1:04:14.891
"Hey, guys, wait up!
What are you doing?"

1:04:14.893 --> 1:04:17.260
We've always felt like
America's little brother.

1:04:17.262 --> 1:04:19.061
This, like, little brother

1:04:19.063 --> 1:04:22.064
who's demanding attention
in his own right.

1:04:22.066 --> 1:04:23.398
It's like being at a party

1:04:23.400 --> 1:04:24.766
and your friend
tells great stories

1:04:24.768 --> 1:04:28.102
and you go, you know,
"I like turkey."

1:04:28.104 --> 1:04:31.905
And it's like, "I had
diarrhea once on a plane.

1:04:31.907 --> 1:04:35.341
Yeah, really embarrassing,
eh?" Yeah.

1:04:35.343 --> 1:04:37.643
Dude, it's, "Marsha,
Marsha, Marsha, Marsha."

1:04:37.645 --> 1:04:39.845
That's what it is growing up
next to the states."

1:04:39.847 --> 1:04:44.415
Let's look at the
iconic American motion
picture, "Twins"

1:04:44.417 --> 1:04:46.984
with Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Danny Devito.

1:04:46.986 --> 1:04:48.819
If they were siamese twins,

1:04:48.821 --> 1:04:51.855
that would really be the story
of America and Canada:

1:04:51.857 --> 1:04:53.623
you are the Danny Devito

1:04:53.625 --> 1:04:56.659
dangling loosely from
Arnold Schwarzenegger's rib.

1:04:56.661 --> 1:04:59.161
(Speaking in French)

1:05:05.435 --> 1:05:06.767
Rob:
If Canada was
an going to be

1:05:06.769 --> 1:05:08.668
a guest on the
"Tonight Show",

1:05:08.670 --> 1:05:10.102
how would Carson
bring them out

1:05:10.104 --> 1:05:11.636
to get the crowd
excited about Canada?

1:05:11.638 --> 1:05:13.504
(Imitating Carson)
Ah, oh yes, that's...

1:05:13.506 --> 1:05:16.340
that's right, Canada.
It's just north of here?

1:05:16.342 --> 1:05:17.808
I've heard of it.

1:05:17.810 --> 1:05:20.310
As a matter of fact, one time,

1:05:20.312 --> 1:05:24.380
uh, the US were thinking
of buying Canada

1:05:24.382 --> 1:05:27.049
and using it as a parking lot.

1:05:27.051 --> 1:05:29.351
I'm yearning for
any acknowledgement
for them.

1:05:29.353 --> 1:05:31.686
You're yearning
for acknowledgement<i> for</i> them?

1:05:31.688 --> 1:05:33.387
Rob:
From the US.

1:05:33.389 --> 1:05:35.389
For Canada? Well that
ain't gonna happen.

1:05:35.391 --> 1:05:37.290
The Americans know
absolutely noth...

1:05:37.292 --> 1:05:39.025
We're attached.

1:05:39.027 --> 1:05:40.292
We're just like...

1:05:40.294 --> 1:05:41.526
You can step over the border.

1:05:41.528 --> 1:05:43.160
It's the exact same thing.

1:05:43.162 --> 1:05:46.396
The thing that really
probably hurt me the most

1:05:46.398 --> 1:05:49.298
was realizing how little

1:05:49.300 --> 1:05:52.167
people thought
about Canada at all.

1:05:52.169 --> 1:05:54.068
You know, like,
most Americans
don't know

1:05:54.070 --> 1:05:58.138
that Canada was,
was, uh, fighting
in Afghanistan...

1:05:58.140 --> 1:05:59.873
And then I'll talk
with Americans who go,

1:05:59.875 --> 1:06:03.042
"Well you guys
never help us out!"

1:06:03.044 --> 1:06:05.544
Well, no, we've
been fighting a war

1:06:05.546 --> 1:06:07.712
for ten years
with you people.
Uh-huh.

1:06:07.714 --> 1:06:11.015
I'd hear my family or friends

1:06:11.017 --> 1:06:13.217
say these same things, you know,

1:06:13.219 --> 1:06:14.651
"Toronto's got a lot
of great restaurants,

1:06:14.653 --> 1:06:16.152
in fact a lot of people
think that Toronto..."

1:06:16.154 --> 1:06:17.753
and I'd say, "No, no, no, no,

1:06:17.755 --> 1:06:19.521
"nobody's thinking anything.

1:06:19.523 --> 1:06:21.189
They haven't mentioned it."

1:06:21.191 --> 1:06:23.424
I've been... I can't
think of the last time

1:06:23.426 --> 1:06:25.893
I heard somebody mention Canada,

1:06:25.895 --> 1:06:27.928
unless they were saying,
"Hey, aren't you Canadian?"

1:06:27.930 --> 1:06:29.829
That's it.

1:06:29.831 --> 1:06:31.697
They never say, "God you know,
I've really got to get up

1:06:31.699 --> 1:06:34.366
"to those restaurants
in Toronto.

1:06:34.368 --> 1:06:38.036
Ah man, oh God, what a system
they have up there."

1:06:38.038 --> 1:06:39.871
Nobody's saying shit about it,

1:06:39.873 --> 1:06:41.505
is the reality.

1:06:41.507 --> 1:06:43.206
My American friend went,

1:06:43.208 --> 1:06:46.209
"Wow, I didn't know
you guys were so mad at us."

1:06:46.211 --> 1:06:47.443
Right?

1:06:47.445 --> 1:06:49.211
And I said, "Well, you know,

1:06:49.213 --> 1:06:50.445
I bet there's a lot of stuff,"

1:06:50.447 --> 1:06:52.046
all indignant,

1:06:52.048 --> 1:06:53.547
"that Americans don't
think about Canada."

1:06:53.549 --> 1:06:55.382
And then I said, "So, you know,

1:06:55.384 --> 1:06:57.283
what do Americans
think about Canada?"

1:06:57.285 --> 1:06:58.751
And my American friend went,

1:06:58.753 --> 1:07:00.185
"We don't."

1:07:00.187 --> 1:07:02.120
I know, growing up in Canada,

1:07:02.122 --> 1:07:04.722
we kind of sneered
at the United States,

1:07:04.724 --> 1:07:07.291
but we couldn't take
our eyes off it.

1:07:07.293 --> 1:07:10.360
Looking over the fence

1:07:10.362 --> 1:07:11.928
at what's going on
next door and going,

1:07:11.930 --> 1:07:14.463
"Hmm, oh, they think
they're so great,"

1:07:14.465 --> 1:07:15.730
you know.

1:07:15.732 --> 1:07:16.964
You know, in the
United States,

1:07:16.966 --> 1:07:18.466
when the financial
markets crash,

1:07:18.468 --> 1:07:19.967
and we don't have
a huge debt anymore,

1:07:19.969 --> 1:07:21.301
and we don't have
a huge deficit,

1:07:21.303 --> 1:07:23.169
suddenly we get
really, you know,

1:07:23.171 --> 1:07:25.204
we get really snotty
about the fact:

1:07:25.206 --> 1:07:27.706
"Well look, well
they're not doing
very well, are they?"

1:07:27.708 --> 1:07:29.174
It's a bit
disingenuous, you know,

1:07:29.176 --> 1:07:30.975
we're not that
charitable towards
the United States.

1:07:30.977 --> 1:07:32.076
Right.

1:07:32.078 --> 1:07:34.211
It seems to be this
torturous thing,

1:07:34.213 --> 1:07:36.546
where we love to be
snotty, like you said.

1:07:36.548 --> 1:07:38.581
But you're doing it yourself,
you don't understand,

1:07:38.583 --> 1:07:41.183
you're now actually
talking down to me
as an American.

1:07:41.185 --> 1:07:42.984
Rob:
Right.

1:07:42.986 --> 1:07:44.652
And talking about how you think
the Canadians are superior,

1:07:44.654 --> 1:07:47.021
but under the guise of,
"We're really humble."

1:07:47.023 --> 1:07:48.922
So I caught you on your bullshit

1:07:48.924 --> 1:07:51.224
right to your face
in my fucking mansion.

1:07:51.226 --> 1:07:53.726
(Bell ringing)

1:07:56.697 --> 1:07:59.230
Rob:
And another issue,
since I'm venting.

1:07:59.232 --> 1:08:01.398
Regardless of what
other countries say,

1:08:01.400 --> 1:08:02.932
I also believed

1:08:02.934 --> 1:08:04.400
Canada was the greatest
country in the world,

1:08:04.402 --> 1:08:06.235
but it's hard
to maintain that feeling

1:08:06.237 --> 1:08:08.370
when your own people act
as though we're second rate.

1:08:08.372 --> 1:08:09.771
So...

1:08:14.444 --> 1:08:16.444
I remember being
at a Canadian award show,

1:08:16.446 --> 1:08:18.179
and two people,
at different times,

1:08:18.181 --> 1:08:20.681
got up and said, "You see,
we're second to none!"

1:08:20.683 --> 1:08:23.784
And no one had brought up any,
you just second to whom.

1:08:23.786 --> 1:08:25.118
But what is that?

1:08:25.120 --> 1:08:26.452
Like, I'm genuinely
asking because...

1:08:26.454 --> 1:08:28.921
I don't, I don't
get it myself.

1:08:28.923 --> 1:08:32.356
The fear that we
weren't good enough.

1:08:32.358 --> 1:08:33.757
Rob:
Right.

1:08:33.759 --> 1:08:36.526
The fear even though
we won the war of 1812,

1:08:36.528 --> 1:08:39.195
I believe.
Yup.

1:08:39.197 --> 1:08:42.298
In 1813, the fear returned.

1:08:42.300 --> 1:08:45.301
Rob:
We seem to revel in
our own second placeness.

1:08:45.303 --> 1:08:47.269
Woman:
Because you always...

1:08:47.271 --> 1:08:49.738
because you've all
been brought up to say
that you were second.

1:08:49.740 --> 1:08:52.040
I've heard it
from every Canadian.

1:08:52.042 --> 1:08:53.808
Now we've had
that conversation,

1:08:53.810 --> 1:08:57.211
and that you guys
are so nationalistic,

1:08:57.213 --> 1:08:59.646
but you've always
been told that
you're second,

1:08:59.648 --> 1:09:01.247
and you really believe it.

1:09:01.249 --> 1:09:03.549
That's my friend
and longtime friend

1:09:03.551 --> 1:09:05.717
and my publicist,
Susie Patricola.

1:09:05.719 --> 1:09:07.051
(New York accent)
She's from New York.

1:09:07.053 --> 1:09:08.552
Rob:
Really?

1:09:08.554 --> 1:09:11.555
And everybody in New York
is number one.

1:09:11.557 --> 1:09:13.757
And they're told they're
number one since birth,

1:09:13.759 --> 1:09:15.291
because its New York.

1:09:15.293 --> 1:09:17.893
I was guilty of it myself.

1:09:17.895 --> 1:09:22.396
"American Woman" was really
just a song by a Canadian band.

1:09:22.398 --> 1:09:23.930
But I remember the first time

1:09:23.932 --> 1:09:25.965
that Slash sat in with my band,

1:09:25.967 --> 1:09:28.500
and he and I went over the list
of things that he wanted to do,

1:09:28.502 --> 1:09:30.068
and you know,
there were classics

1:09:30.070 --> 1:09:33.004
by Zeppelin in there and AC/DC,

1:09:33.006 --> 1:09:35.239
and he says, "American Woman."

1:09:35.241 --> 1:09:37.574
And I said, "Hold it!

1:09:37.576 --> 1:09:39.409
You want to do
'American Woman'?"

1:09:39.411 --> 1:09:41.911
He says, "Yeah, it's great,

1:09:41.913 --> 1:09:44.113
it's one of the
classic guitar riffs,"

1:09:44.115 --> 1:09:48.416
and I realized, "Yeah,"
you know, "I guess it is."

1:09:48.418 --> 1:09:53.253
But as a Canadian,
I never really thought so,

1:09:53.255 --> 1:09:56.322
until Slash, you know,
told me that it was so.

1:09:56.324 --> 1:10:00.125
There's a famous story
about, uh, John Candy,

1:10:00.127 --> 1:10:01.960
where he was at Toronto Airport,

1:10:01.962 --> 1:10:04.595
and a Toronto Airport
Canadian baggage handler

1:10:04.597 --> 1:10:06.263
turns to him and says,

1:10:06.265 --> 1:10:07.931
"Hey, John Candy,
you're from Toronto right?"

1:10:07.933 --> 1:10:09.265
And he goes, "Yeah, I am."

1:10:09.267 --> 1:10:10.966
He goes, "Let me
ask you something,

1:10:10.968 --> 1:10:14.469
"why is it that when you
Canadian comedians make it big,

1:10:14.471 --> 1:10:16.103
you never buy a place
in Toronto?"

1:10:16.105 --> 1:10:17.604
And John Candy said,
"What are you talking about,

1:10:17.606 --> 1:10:18.838
I have a place in Toronto..."

1:10:18.840 --> 1:10:20.372
And the baggage handler goes,

1:10:20.374 --> 1:10:22.173
"Oh, I thought you'd
made it big, eh?"

1:10:22.175 --> 1:10:23.941
I like "eh" too,
because "eh" is like,

1:10:23.943 --> 1:10:26.043
"It's nice out, eh?"

1:10:26.045 --> 1:10:27.310
You can't just
say it's nice out.

1:10:27.312 --> 1:10:29.278
You have to go, "Am I right?

1:10:29.280 --> 1:10:30.712
That's true, isn't it?

1:10:30.714 --> 1:10:33.548
It is, it is nice out,
isn't it?"

1:10:33.550 --> 1:10:35.149
Rob:
And now that we're
discussing it,

1:10:35.151 --> 1:10:37.317
I scanned my memory banks,
to try and dig up

1:10:37.319 --> 1:10:41.520
when specifically
I may have first learned
this bizarre behavior.

1:10:41.522 --> 1:10:42.787
Then it hit me...

1:10:42.789 --> 1:10:44.021
(Music: "O Canada")

1:10:44.023 --> 1:10:45.655
If I was designing the flag,

1:10:45.657 --> 1:10:46.989
I would make it a little bit
different than this,

1:10:46.991 --> 1:10:48.690
but it's an okay flag.

1:10:48.692 --> 1:10:50.692
Rob:
How would you redesign it?

1:10:50.694 --> 1:10:52.827
Rob's mother:
If it was outlined
in black, for example,

1:10:52.829 --> 1:10:54.695
it would just be
much more attractive."

1:10:54.697 --> 1:10:57.197
Rob:
So then, by having
that flag all over the world,

1:10:57.199 --> 1:10:59.299
and when people
see it around they go,

1:10:59.301 --> 1:11:02.168
"Oh, the Canadian flag
equals Canadians

1:11:02.170 --> 1:11:03.402
are pasty and boring?"

1:11:03.404 --> 1:11:05.003
That would be a connection.

1:11:05.005 --> 1:11:06.404
That would definitely
be a connection,

1:11:06.406 --> 1:11:08.739
and if the flag was made
much more dynamic,

1:11:08.741 --> 1:11:11.007
I think they would see us
also differently.

1:11:11.009 --> 1:11:13.075
Now this, I think is attractive.

1:11:13.077 --> 1:11:14.709
Rob:
Right.

1:11:14.711 --> 1:11:18.245
This thing is done
by a local Aboriginal person,

1:11:18.247 --> 1:11:20.480
and the Canadian flag
should be this.

1:11:20.482 --> 1:11:22.548
This has got a story to tell,

1:11:22.550 --> 1:11:24.983
and this is just ehhh...

1:11:24.985 --> 1:11:26.718
It does not represent us,

1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:28.753
and I'm going to send a note
to parliament to tell them that.

1:11:28.755 --> 1:11:32.056
Rob:
Well, I think we've found
our next Prime Minster.

1:11:32.058 --> 1:11:34.858
But all these new revelations
I was having on my trip

1:11:34.860 --> 1:11:37.894
were triggering even more
deeply buried issues.

1:11:37.896 --> 1:11:41.864
And directly connected
with other problems
I still deal with today.

1:11:41.866 --> 1:11:44.900
Like when I describe Calgary
to people from outside Canada,

1:11:44.902 --> 1:11:46.334
I usually end up saying,

1:11:46.336 --> 1:11:48.369
"It's like a Canadian Denver."

1:11:48.371 --> 1:11:50.337
Torontonians
usually have to say,

1:11:50.339 --> 1:11:52.672
"We are the New York of Canada."

1:11:52.674 --> 1:11:55.041
This always felt
like some sort of

1:11:55.043 --> 1:11:58.244
classically Canadian
concession to keep
the conversation going.

1:11:58.246 --> 1:12:00.412
So I also wanted to know...

1:12:04.451 --> 1:12:05.917
There's a comparative
thing about Canadians.

1:12:05.919 --> 1:12:08.552
It's weird like,
even Canadians
will say,

1:12:08.554 --> 1:12:11.421
"Oh yeah, I just
got a subscription
to MacLean's Magazine.

1:12:11.423 --> 1:12:12.922
It's the Canadian 'Time'."

1:12:12.924 --> 1:12:14.556
Yeah.
Or it's the Canadian this.

1:12:14.558 --> 1:12:17.025
The Canadian version of...

1:12:17.027 --> 1:12:19.293
as if nothing
originated in Canada.

1:12:19.295 --> 1:12:20.794
I do it all the time.

1:12:20.796 --> 1:12:23.530
And I think it's
a way to explain it

1:12:23.532 --> 1:12:26.533
but also to validate it,
to make it seem important,

1:12:26.535 --> 1:12:28.067
which I think is hilarious,

1:12:28.069 --> 1:12:30.469
because MacLean's Magazine
is important.

1:12:30.471 --> 1:12:33.238
MacLean's on its own
is a great magazine.
Yeah, yeah.

1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:34.872
It doesn't need to be
"the Canadian..."

1:12:34.874 --> 1:12:38.108
I believe it's won
the Canadian Pulitzer.

1:12:38.110 --> 1:12:40.243
Well, Canadian
congratulations.
(Laughing)

1:12:40.245 --> 1:12:41.644
Yeah I guess we could
just be like,

1:12:41.646 --> 1:12:43.445
"It's the Canadian
music awards,"

1:12:43.447 --> 1:12:44.712
but then we'd always
have to throw in

1:12:44.714 --> 1:12:45.946
"like the Grammy's."

1:12:45.948 --> 1:12:48.481
I guess we just feel inadequate.

1:12:48.483 --> 1:12:51.884
I think that what happens is,
because we're so close,

1:12:51.886 --> 1:12:53.785
we get everything
that they have.

1:12:53.787 --> 1:12:55.953
But, they don't get
anything that we have.

1:12:55.955 --> 1:12:57.988
You know about the contest
MacLean's had years ago?

1:12:57.990 --> 1:12:59.823
Right.
Where they had,
there was the sentence,

1:12:59.825 --> 1:13:01.090
"As American as apple pie,"

1:13:01.092 --> 1:13:03.058
and then they asked
Canadians to finish,

1:13:03.060 --> 1:13:04.959
"As Canadian as..."
Do you know that contest?
Right. Right, yes.

1:13:04.961 --> 1:13:07.795
So the winning entry was
"As Canadian as possible...

1:13:07.797 --> 1:13:09.496
under the circumstances."
"Under the circumstances, "

1:13:09.498 --> 1:13:10.930
yeah, which is
a great line.
Yeah.

1:13:10.932 --> 1:13:12.164
Yeah, and it's...

1:13:12.166 --> 1:13:13.899
But imagine we would
have that contest...

1:13:13.901 --> 1:13:15.634
Yes.
And no one
could win it.

1:13:15.636 --> 1:13:18.470
Yeah I never liked
"Canada's answer to..."

1:13:18.472 --> 1:13:20.138
Because nobody's asking.

1:13:20.140 --> 1:13:22.306
We can't say what it
means to be a Canadian.

1:13:22.308 --> 1:13:24.408
All we can say is
we're not American.

1:13:24.410 --> 1:13:25.976
We actually define
ourselves by saying,

1:13:25.978 --> 1:13:27.310
"We're not
something else,"

1:13:27.312 --> 1:13:29.445
which is sick.

1:13:29.447 --> 1:13:31.079
I mean America has,
you know, mom, the flag,
and apple pie.

1:13:31.081 --> 1:13:32.313
And what do we have?

1:13:32.315 --> 1:13:34.281
"We're not like Americans."

1:13:34.283 --> 1:13:36.483
Rob:
Just thinking about
this instinctive urge

1:13:36.485 --> 1:13:37.817
made me crazy.

1:13:37.819 --> 1:13:40.286
We were just as good,
if not better,

1:13:40.288 --> 1:13:41.987
than the next guy, right?

1:13:41.989 --> 1:13:43.588
Right?

1:13:43.590 --> 1:13:45.156
(Weakly)
Right?

1:13:45.158 --> 1:13:47.992
So once again,
I sought professional advice.

1:13:47.994 --> 1:13:50.527
But this time,
I didn't go as me.

1:13:50.529 --> 1:13:53.963
I went representing
all of Canada.

1:13:53.965 --> 1:13:56.198
¶ If you could read
my mind, love ¶

1:13:56.200 --> 1:13:57.832
¶ What a tale
my thoughts could tell ¶

1:13:57.834 --> 1:13:59.600
Marsha, thank
you so much

1:13:59.602 --> 1:14:02.202
for taking the time
to see me today.

1:14:02.204 --> 1:14:04.305
I really, really
appreciate it.

1:14:04.307 --> 1:14:05.973
It's my pleasure...

1:14:05.975 --> 1:14:07.307
Uh, if you can,

1:14:07.309 --> 1:14:09.642
just a quick
description of yourself

1:14:09.644 --> 1:14:12.144
and your qualifications.

1:14:12.146 --> 1:14:13.912
I'm a psychotherapist.

1:14:13.914 --> 1:14:16.714
I basically work
with individuals

1:14:16.716 --> 1:14:20.484
and also do quite
a bit of couple
counseling.

1:14:20.486 --> 1:14:23.819
That is perfect,
because my parents
are British and French.

1:14:23.821 --> 1:14:25.620
Yeah.

1:14:25.622 --> 1:14:28.089
Who got together
in sort of awkward
circumstances,

1:14:28.091 --> 1:14:29.457
just to be polite,

1:14:29.459 --> 1:14:30.825
and live next door
to this neighbour

1:14:30.827 --> 1:14:32.660
that has this
amazing house

1:14:32.662 --> 1:14:34.895
and seems to have
parties all the time.

1:14:34.897 --> 1:14:36.830
So that doesn't sound

1:14:36.832 --> 1:14:39.566
like it was the
healthiest beginning,
emotionally,

1:14:39.568 --> 1:14:41.501
for me as a
young country.

1:14:41.503 --> 1:14:43.402
Well, I mean,
if your parents

1:14:43.404 --> 1:14:46.304
are Britain and France,

1:14:46.306 --> 1:14:47.972
they couldn't
live together,

1:14:47.974 --> 1:14:49.573
and they got a divorce.

1:14:49.575 --> 1:14:50.974
The second thing is,

1:14:50.976 --> 1:14:52.976
because there's a lot
of repression,

1:14:52.978 --> 1:14:55.178
you have a lot of individuals

1:14:55.180 --> 1:14:57.013
not feeling that great
about themselves.

1:14:57.015 --> 1:14:58.948
I definitely feel inferior.

1:14:58.950 --> 1:15:01.183
If I started
to see you regularly,

1:15:01.185 --> 1:15:04.486
what help might
you give me to
get over that?

1:15:04.488 --> 1:15:10.124
I don't know what,
other to say than
you can't be happy,

1:15:10.126 --> 1:15:14.094
Canada, if you keep
on describing yourself

1:15:14.096 --> 1:15:15.962
in relation to anything.

1:15:15.964 --> 1:15:17.964
You have to become
an entity,

1:15:17.966 --> 1:15:19.298
define yourself.

1:15:19.300 --> 1:15:21.099
But what is it?

1:15:21.101 --> 1:15:24.469
We are a country
that is great.

1:15:24.471 --> 1:15:26.304
Why don't we realize that

1:15:26.306 --> 1:15:29.840
and have a little
more acceptance
about ourselves?

1:15:34.479 --> 1:15:37.979
What is your opinion
on that situation?

1:15:37.981 --> 1:15:39.847
Which situation?

1:15:39.849 --> 1:15:43.183
The one we just discussed
about, you know,

1:15:43.185 --> 1:15:44.684
Canada's
comparative habit.

1:15:56.697 --> 1:15:58.897
I can think of another
question if it makes...

1:15:58.899 --> 1:16:01.366
it's very tense
in here right now.

1:16:01.368 --> 1:16:04.035
I thought I was
going to feel better
when I came here,

1:16:04.037 --> 1:16:06.203
but I actually
want to gently
open this window

1:16:06.205 --> 1:16:09.206
and apologize
and then jump
and apologize.

1:16:09.208 --> 1:16:12.642
Then I've done
my job well.

1:16:12.644 --> 1:16:15.811
I know all patient/doctor
conversations are supposed
to remain private,

1:16:15.813 --> 1:16:18.880
but those realizations
really bummed me out.

1:16:18.882 --> 1:16:22.049
And even scarier,
Canada Day was looming.

1:16:22.051 --> 1:16:24.384
I needed to get going,
but before I did...

1:16:24.386 --> 1:16:26.986
I had an old score to settle.

1:16:26.988 --> 1:16:28.654
(Music)

1:16:28.656 --> 1:16:31.456
Ye-e-e-e-es!

1:16:33.593 --> 1:16:35.492
Fuck you, Macklamore!

1:16:35.494 --> 1:16:36.893
I'm back,

1:16:36.895 --> 1:16:38.660
and I'm directing
a movie, bitch!

1:16:41.598 --> 1:16:44.932
Dumb vengeance is mine!

1:16:44.934 --> 1:16:46.533
But I couldn't
savour it too long,

1:16:46.535 --> 1:16:48.935
as I only had only one day left
to get to Vancouver,

1:16:48.937 --> 1:16:52.538
and get some sort of
clear conclusion about my quest.

1:16:52.540 --> 1:16:55.073
So reluctantly, I left Calgary.

1:16:55.075 --> 1:16:57.341
(Music on radio)

1:16:57.343 --> 1:17:00.577
And as I drove along
the TransCanada highway
towards the Rockies,

1:17:00.579 --> 1:17:02.912
the quiet of the road
allowed me to...

1:17:02.914 --> 1:17:05.114
feel terrible.

1:17:05.116 --> 1:17:07.449
I still didn't have
a definitive answer

1:17:07.451 --> 1:17:09.551
on what it means to be Canadian.

1:17:09.553 --> 1:17:11.553
If I hadn't come
close to it now,

1:17:11.555 --> 1:17:13.855
after crossing
the entire country,

1:17:13.857 --> 1:17:15.723
would I ever?

1:17:15.725 --> 1:17:19.193
And then, adding maple frosting
to my crap cake,

1:17:19.195 --> 1:17:20.894
as I passed through
Banff National Park

1:17:20.896 --> 1:17:22.528
and began climbing the mountains

1:17:22.530 --> 1:17:24.730
towards the Alberta,
British Columbia border...

1:17:24.732 --> 1:17:26.565
a storm hit.

1:17:26.567 --> 1:17:28.099
(Thunder clap)

1:17:28.101 --> 1:17:29.600
It got bad fast,

1:17:29.602 --> 1:17:32.302
and the narrow mountain highway
was closed down.

1:17:32.304 --> 1:17:34.304
I pulled off into a tiny town

1:17:34.306 --> 1:17:37.240
and realized I may
not have only blown
finding an answer,...

1:17:37.242 --> 1:17:39.141
I may not even be able
to make my simpler goal

1:17:39.143 --> 1:17:40.475
of getting to Vancouver.

1:17:40.477 --> 1:17:42.143
(Music)

1:17:42.145 --> 1:17:44.545
So while the skies
drowned my hopes,

1:17:44.547 --> 1:17:46.713
I went to drown my sorrows.

1:17:46.715 --> 1:17:48.781
I was so sad.

1:17:48.783 --> 1:17:50.883
I was sad about leaving Calgary.

1:17:50.885 --> 1:17:52.818
I was sad about all
the time and effort

1:17:52.820 --> 1:17:54.653
that I had put into this film.

1:17:54.655 --> 1:17:56.554
And I was really sad
I had to listen

1:17:56.556 --> 1:17:58.989
to the bar's musician
sing about his divorce.

1:17:58.991 --> 1:18:00.724
Off key.

1:18:00.726 --> 1:18:03.426
My trip had started
with such promise.

1:18:03.428 --> 1:18:06.529
I had so many
amazing experiences.

1:18:09.800 --> 1:18:11.833
But as I ordered another round,

1:18:11.835 --> 1:18:13.734
and my brain got foggier,

1:18:13.736 --> 1:18:17.304
I knew that to save this
movie, and my quest,

1:18:17.306 --> 1:18:19.406
it would take
something truly great.

1:18:19.408 --> 1:18:23.309
(Echoing)
Great, great...

1:18:23.311 --> 1:18:26.245
(Static)

1:18:26.247 --> 1:18:27.479
(Squeaking)

1:18:31.484 --> 1:18:33.784
Hello, Rob.

1:18:33.786 --> 1:18:35.085
Yes, it's me.

1:18:35.087 --> 1:18:36.319
The Great One.

1:18:36.321 --> 1:18:37.586
How's it going?

1:18:37.588 --> 1:18:39.120
You can't give up.

1:18:39.122 --> 1:18:41.522
Not now, when
you're so close.

1:18:41.524 --> 1:18:43.790
Just get to Vancouver,
for it is there

1:18:43.792 --> 1:18:46.526
you'll get the final
answers you need.

1:18:46.528 --> 1:18:48.027
Trust me on this.

1:18:48.029 --> 1:18:52.164
Believe in your quest,
and believe in Canada.

1:18:52.166 --> 1:18:53.398
Got to skate!

1:19:00.873 --> 1:19:03.506
And then, like a maple miracle,

1:19:03.508 --> 1:19:05.140
(Squeaking)
the storm stopped.

1:19:05.142 --> 1:19:06.808
And the roads were back open.

1:19:06.810 --> 1:19:09.443
I may still make it
for Canada Day!

1:19:09.445 --> 1:19:11.645
And as I headed down
into British Columbia,

1:19:11.647 --> 1:19:13.713
I realized I wasn't
the only one.

1:19:13.715 --> 1:19:16.148
Being Canadian, wooo!

1:19:16.150 --> 1:19:18.283
Fucking Canada!
(mixed cheering)

1:19:18.285 --> 1:19:20.118
Rob:
A bunch of my other
fellow Canadians

1:19:20.120 --> 1:19:21.853
were headed to Vancouver
to celebrate,

1:19:21.855 --> 1:19:24.689
and their enthusiasm
gave me a final boost

1:19:24.691 --> 1:19:26.557
to say clock be damned.
(Honking)

1:19:26.559 --> 1:19:29.393
I may still be able
to get the answer to my quest.

1:19:29.395 --> 1:19:31.862
But with only 13 hours
left until midnight,

1:19:31.864 --> 1:19:33.363
it was going to be tight.

1:19:33.365 --> 1:19:48.377
(Music)

1:19:49.580 --> 1:19:51.546
I blasted into Canada Place,

1:19:51.548 --> 1:19:53.848
where the Canada Day celebration
had already began.

1:19:53.850 --> 1:19:55.082
(Crowd cheers)

1:19:55.084 --> 1:19:57.050
I was greeted by a huge,
patriotic crowd,

1:19:57.052 --> 1:20:00.986
some in both complimentary
and non-complimentary outfits.

1:20:00.988 --> 1:20:02.354
Getting desperate,

1:20:02.356 --> 1:20:03.722
I went looking
for final inspiration

1:20:03.724 --> 1:20:05.156
on what it means
to be Canadian

1:20:05.158 --> 1:20:07.191
in the main convention center.

1:20:07.193 --> 1:20:09.159
I browsed the invention zone,

1:20:09.161 --> 1:20:12.162
proudly listing all
our amazing contributions.

1:20:12.164 --> 1:20:13.429
Like the paint roller,

1:20:13.431 --> 1:20:14.997
the McIntosh apple,

1:20:14.999 --> 1:20:16.231
the light bulb,

1:20:16.233 --> 1:20:17.498
the telephone,

1:20:17.500 --> 1:20:18.765
and of course....

1:20:18.767 --> 1:20:20.900
The Canadarm.

1:20:20.902 --> 1:20:22.835
A choir politely
rocked the crowd

1:20:22.837 --> 1:20:24.870
with an upbeat version
of our anthem.

1:20:24.872 --> 1:20:27.272
The crowd went politely crazy.

1:20:30.610 --> 1:20:32.876
There was an amazing
swearing in ceremony

1:20:32.878 --> 1:20:36.246
for a room full of excited
new Canadian citizens.

1:20:36.248 --> 1:20:40.683
Who got a lot more excited
when they saw their first
official Canadian cake.

1:20:40.685 --> 1:20:43.084
Obviously cut by a Mountie.

1:20:45.955 --> 1:20:48.055
But as touching and cool
as this was,

1:20:48.057 --> 1:20:50.223
it didn't squash the panic
building inside me

1:20:50.225 --> 1:20:52.058
as the hall shut down
for the evening,

1:20:52.060 --> 1:20:54.193
and the sun began to set.

1:20:54.195 --> 1:20:55.460
The only place I had left to go

1:20:55.462 --> 1:20:57.195
was the Canada Day
parade downtown,

1:20:57.197 --> 1:20:59.964
so I raced off.

1:20:59.966 --> 1:21:02.132
Unfortunately, by the time
we made it there,

1:21:02.134 --> 1:21:04.633
it had already started,
and we scrambled to set up.

1:21:06.203 --> 1:21:07.468
The last time I was
at this parade

1:21:07.470 --> 1:21:09.870
was as a little kid,
decades ago,

1:21:09.872 --> 1:21:13.039
and just like me,
it was a lot smaller then.

1:21:13.041 --> 1:21:14.907
And was also afraid of girls.

1:21:14.909 --> 1:21:17.776
But, thankfully, it still
had that home-town feel,

1:21:17.778 --> 1:21:21.212
and I was delighted by all
of its classic trappings:

1:21:21.214 --> 1:21:24.415
Marching bands, pageant winners,

1:21:24.417 --> 1:21:26.683
people in colourful
and exotic costumes...

1:21:29.454 --> 1:21:32.988
and even some old
childhood friends.

1:21:32.990 --> 1:21:36.424
I even spotted some
of my new friends.

1:21:36.426 --> 1:21:38.159
The excitement over
my country's birthday

1:21:38.161 --> 1:21:40.594
was palpable
from the huge mixed crowd...

1:21:40.596 --> 1:21:43.396
Hip, hip, hooray!
Hip, hip, hooray!

1:21:43.398 --> 1:21:45.198
But through my delight,

1:21:45.200 --> 1:21:48.334
a sad realization
was beginning to wash over me.

1:21:48.336 --> 1:21:51.070
Dusk was fast approaching,
and I started to worry

1:21:51.072 --> 1:21:54.273
this whole trip hadn't
been worth the hassle.

1:21:54.275 --> 1:21:56.742
I was getting on a plane
back to L.A. the next morning

1:21:56.744 --> 1:21:59.778
and still didn't have
a clear, simple answer

1:21:59.780 --> 1:22:01.946
that could explain
my beloved home

1:22:01.948 --> 1:22:04.682
to an ignorant
and indifferent world.

1:22:04.684 --> 1:22:06.750
I was really bummed

1:22:06.752 --> 1:22:08.384
and took a seat
amongst the revelers

1:22:08.386 --> 1:22:11.487
to let the reality
of my failed quest sink in.

1:22:14.558 --> 1:22:16.257
But even that wasn't working,

1:22:16.259 --> 1:22:18.692
because there was so much noise.

1:22:18.694 --> 1:22:20.226
I couldn't concentrate

1:22:20.228 --> 1:22:22.261
surrounded by the wild
rambunctious crowd.

1:22:22.263 --> 1:22:23.495
So I got up to leave...

1:22:25.131 --> 1:22:26.597
and then it hit me.

1:22:26.599 --> 1:22:28.565
The last time
I was at this parade,

1:22:28.567 --> 1:22:31.768
people were never
this excited about it.

1:22:31.770 --> 1:22:33.236
I don't know what happened,

1:22:33.238 --> 1:22:34.904
but while I was living
in the states,

1:22:34.906 --> 1:22:36.772
my fellow Canadians
seemed to have found

1:22:36.774 --> 1:22:41.042
an amazing new level
of public national enthusiasm.

1:22:41.044 --> 1:22:43.377
And maybe it was right
in front of me the entire trip,

1:22:43.379 --> 1:22:45.645
but was my old way
of looking at Canada

1:22:45.647 --> 1:22:47.980
what kept me from noticing it?

1:22:47.982 --> 1:22:50.115
Watching everyone around me now,

1:22:50.117 --> 1:22:52.117
I couldn't help being
overwhelmed

1:22:52.119 --> 1:22:55.887
with my own brand new,
very powerful sense of pride.

1:22:55.889 --> 1:22:57.655
The reason I'm
doing this right now

1:22:57.657 --> 1:23:00.090
is because you said
that it's done by Canadians,

1:23:00.092 --> 1:23:02.459
it's about Canada,
and I'm proud to be part of it.

1:23:02.461 --> 1:23:05.428
I got a star
on the Canadian walk of fame.

1:23:05.430 --> 1:23:07.463
And I had a line
in my speech which was,

1:23:07.465 --> 1:23:09.465
"I'm an actor, I'm a writer,

1:23:09.467 --> 1:23:12.634
"I'm a producer, and a comedian,

1:23:12.636 --> 1:23:16.237
"but no description of me
would be complete

1:23:16.239 --> 1:23:18.839
without mentioning
that I'm also Canadian."

1:23:20.576 --> 1:23:22.976
The stars that I know
that live here,

1:23:22.978 --> 1:23:24.811
in a minute,
they would go back to Canada

1:23:24.813 --> 1:23:26.579
and do, mostly,

1:23:26.581 --> 1:23:29.448
sometimes to live for their
summer homes, to perform.

1:23:29.450 --> 1:23:31.850
They always like
to go back home.

1:23:31.852 --> 1:23:33.818
They never want to lose

1:23:33.820 --> 1:23:36.287
the part of Canada
that's in there.

1:23:36.289 --> 1:23:37.788
Myself included.

1:23:37.790 --> 1:23:39.122
I would never want
to not be a Canadian.

1:23:39.124 --> 1:23:40.690
You're always Canadian.

1:23:40.692 --> 1:23:43.192
And it's something that
I think we're proud of,

1:23:43.194 --> 1:23:44.860
as much as we don't
understand it.

1:23:44.862 --> 1:23:46.995
You know we'll
always have a love

1:23:46.997 --> 1:23:49.163
in our hearts for Canada.

1:23:49.165 --> 1:23:52.132
You will satirize Canada
and talk about the "sorry"

1:23:52.134 --> 1:23:54.968
and the niceness
and how lame it is
in a lot of ways,

1:23:54.970 --> 1:23:56.502
but with great affection,

1:23:56.504 --> 1:23:58.370
and it's a connection
that we all have.

1:23:58.372 --> 1:24:01.873
I think that Canada has kind
of grown into it's own

1:24:01.875 --> 1:24:03.307
in the last few years.

1:24:03.309 --> 1:24:04.875
Being able to walk
down the street

1:24:04.877 --> 1:24:07.310
dressed like this
and not have my ass kicked.

1:24:07.312 --> 1:24:09.779
(Speaking in French)

1:24:10.948 --> 1:24:12.981
We appreciate our own coolness

1:24:12.983 --> 1:24:15.516
and the fact that we are
kind of under the radar

1:24:15.518 --> 1:24:17.050
and that we are more subtle.

1:24:17.052 --> 1:24:19.218
I tell you something,

1:24:19.220 --> 1:24:22.120
a lot of Canadian people
didn't know what they have,

1:24:22.122 --> 1:24:23.888
you have gold in your hand.

1:24:23.890 --> 1:24:25.823
I think Canadians are waking up

1:24:25.825 --> 1:24:28.392
to the fact that this is
about the best place
in the world to live.

1:24:28.394 --> 1:24:30.360
I think that people
kind of know that now,

1:24:30.362 --> 1:24:31.961
it's like the secret's out.

1:24:31.963 --> 1:24:33.195
Rob:
Incredible.

1:24:33.197 --> 1:24:35.163
And they were all right.

1:24:35.165 --> 1:24:37.832
This movie shouldn't try
to show what it means
being Canadian.

1:24:37.834 --> 1:24:39.133
It should show people
what it means

1:24:39.135 --> 1:24:41.301
being Canadian today.

1:24:41.303 --> 1:24:42.735
Wait a second,

1:24:42.737 --> 1:24:45.170
that was the answer
I'd been searching for.

1:24:45.172 --> 1:24:46.905
And for the first time
in my life,

1:24:46.907 --> 1:24:51.976
the solution to my problem
became crystal clear.

1:24:51.978 --> 1:24:54.178
I was wasting my time
getting angry

1:24:54.180 --> 1:24:56.480
trying to get the world's
approval or recognition.

1:24:56.482 --> 1:24:59.716
Because today's Canada
doesn't need it.

1:24:59.718 --> 1:25:01.718
I shouldn't feel
sad that I left

1:25:01.720 --> 1:25:04.420
or mad that non-Canadians
are ignorant about us,

1:25:04.422 --> 1:25:06.088
because regardless
of where we go

1:25:06.090 --> 1:25:07.489
or who we meet,

1:25:07.491 --> 1:25:09.991
we will always be
as cool as the ice

1:25:09.993 --> 1:25:12.226
they think
we skate to work on.

1:25:12.228 --> 1:25:14.094
And after all this,

1:25:14.096 --> 1:25:17.430
if someone still can't
appreciate our special quirks,

1:25:17.432 --> 1:25:20.266
that's their loss, not mine.

1:25:20.268 --> 1:25:24.369
And just like that,
a huge igloo-shaped weight

1:25:24.371 --> 1:25:26.270
melted off my shoulders

1:25:26.272 --> 1:25:28.105
and not with a second to spare.

1:25:28.107 --> 1:25:30.607
(Bell tolling)

1:25:30.609 --> 1:25:33.009
Mission accomplished!

1:25:33.011 --> 1:25:34.343
But even though it was late,

1:25:34.345 --> 1:25:35.944
and I was exhausted
from my trip,

1:25:35.946 --> 1:25:37.745
this was a moment
for celebration,

1:25:37.747 --> 1:25:40.781
so I raced back to join up
with my partying countrymen.

1:25:40.783 --> 1:25:44.351
(Mixed cheering)

1:25:48.690 --> 1:25:50.122
Unfortunately,

1:25:50.124 --> 1:25:52.524
I may have celebrated
a little too hard.

1:25:52.526 --> 1:25:54.526
I don't remember much,

1:25:54.528 --> 1:25:56.561
except that
I missed my flight,

1:25:56.563 --> 1:25:58.629
everything tasted like maple,

1:25:58.631 --> 1:26:01.231
and I needed to come back
to Vancouver in a month

1:26:01.233 --> 1:26:04.300
to explain a 500 dollar summons
for public drunkeness.

1:26:06.404 --> 1:26:07.636
Sorry.

1:26:09.640 --> 1:26:12.974
Rob:
Best Canada Day ever.

1:26:12.976 --> 1:26:15.543
¶ I want to take you
to a place I know ¶

1:26:15.545 --> 1:26:17.644
¶ A place that's called Canada ¶

1:26:20.248 --> 1:26:21.947
¶ I want to take you
to a place ¶

1:26:21.949 --> 1:26:24.182
¶ I want to take you to Canada ¶

1:26:25.618 --> 1:26:27.551
¶ Whoa-whoa-oh ¶

1:26:28.954 --> 1:26:30.719
¶ Whoa-whoa-oh ¶

1:26:32.456 --> 1:26:34.389
¶ Whoa-whoa-oh ¶

1:26:35.925 --> 1:26:37.824
¶ Whoa-whoa-oh ¶

1:26:40.929 --> 1:26:43.129
¶ I want to take you
to a place I know ¶

1:26:43.131 --> 1:26:45.196
¶ A place that's called Canada ¶

1:26:47.733 --> 1:26:49.966
¶ I want to take you
to a place I know ¶

1:26:49.968 --> 1:26:52.068
¶ A place that's called Canada ¶

1:26:53.104 --> 1:26:55.037
¶ Whoa-whoa-oh ¶

1:26:56.440 --> 1:26:58.205
¶ Whoa-whoa-oh ¶

1:26:59.942 --> 1:27:01.875
¶ Whoa-whoa-oh ¶

1:27:03.411 --> 1:27:05.310
¶ Whoa-whoa-oh ¶

1:27:08.148 --> 1:27:10.248
¶ Sitting all alone
and all I know ¶

1:27:10.250 --> 1:27:12.983
¶ Is that I want
to go to Canada ¶

1:27:15.020 --> 1:27:17.086
¶ Sitting all alone,
pick up the phone ¶

1:27:17.088 --> 1:27:20.756
¶ And call Ramone
and go to Canada ¶

1:27:20.758 --> 1:27:23.492
¶ Whoa-whoa-oh ¶

1:27:23.494 --> 1:27:26.094
¶ British Colombia ¶

1:27:26.096 --> 1:27:28.763
¶ Alberta ¶

1:27:28.765 --> 1:27:30.164
¶ Saskatchewan ¶

1:27:30.166 --> 1:27:32.599
¶ Manitoba ¶

1:27:32.601 --> 1:27:34.601
¶ Ontario ¶

1:27:34.603 --> 1:27:36.369
¶ Quebec ¶

1:27:36.371 --> 1:27:38.137
¶ New Brunswick ¶

1:27:38.139 --> 1:27:41.673
¶ And Nova Scotia ¶

1:27:41.675 --> 1:27:43.841
¶ P.E.I. ¶

1:27:43.843 --> 1:27:49.012
¶ And Newfoundland
too ¶

1:27:49.014 --> 1:27:53.583
¶ And don't forget
the territories ¶

1:27:57.221 --> 1:27:59.554
¶ Nunavut ¶

1:27:59.556 --> 1:28:01.489
¶ Oh, Northwest
Territories ¶

1:28:01.491 --> 1:28:02.723
Rob:
Yes.

1:28:02.725 --> 1:28:04.157
¶ The Yukon ¶

1:28:04.159 --> 1:28:08.293
¶ And Nunavut too ¶

1:28:08.295 --> 1:28:10.695
¶ That's Canada ¶

1:28:10.697 --> 1:28:15.031
¶ We are Canadian ¶

1:28:15.033 --> 1:28:17.967
So, if the Canadian National
Anthem was left up to me,

1:28:17.969 --> 1:28:21.036
I think it would go
a little something like this:

1:28:21.038 --> 1:28:28.509
(Rhythmic record scratching)

1:28:28.511 --> 1:28:31.478
(Remixed "O Canada")

1:28:31.480 --> 1:28:41.521
(Music)

1:28:41.523 --> 1:28:46.491
(Music)

1:28:46.493 --> 1:28:48.092
And then.

1:28:48.094 --> 1:28:49.660
I might go...

1:28:49.662 --> 1:28:52.229
Something like this...

1:28:52.231 --> 1:28:55.398
(Scratching)

1:28:55.400 --> 1:28:57.500
("Everybody's Working
for the Weekend" by Loverboy)

1:28:57.502 --> 1:28:58.767
Yeah, baby!

1:28:58.769 --> 1:29:01.002
Loverboy!

1:29:01.004 --> 1:29:15.983
(Music)

1:29:26.962 --> 1:29:32.665
("O Canada")
