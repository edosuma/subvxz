Dino Dana!

[Dana]
"Dino Match Maker."

00:57.358 --> 00:58.826
What is this thing?

00:58.859 --> 01:01.329
I've never seen anything
like it before.

01:01.362 --> 01:02.730
Who made it?

01:02.763 --> 01:05.433
[chirping]

01:05.466 --> 01:06.834
Sinornithosaurus,

01:06.867 --> 01:09.337
did you make this?

01:10.804 --> 01:12.773
You did!

01:12.806 --> 01:14.375
But why?

01:14.408 --> 01:16.677
[squawking]

01:16.710 --> 01:19.580
[both dinos squawking]

01:19.613 --> 01:22.150
Another Sinornithosaurus!

01:22.183 --> 01:24.618
That one's bigger than you.
It must be a girl.

01:24.652 --> 01:28.122
Just like birds, a lot of dino
girls were bigger than the boys.

01:28.156 --> 01:30.391
Ooh, do you
like her?

01:30.424 --> 01:31.692
[hiss]

01:31.725 --> 01:33.527
You do...

01:33.561 --> 01:36.197
Did you make this for her?

01:37.265 --> 01:39.133
Is it a nest?

01:39.167 --> 01:43.604
[squawking]

01:43.637 --> 01:45.306
Ouch.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.508
I guess she doesn't like it.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.177
But why not?

01:50.278 --> 01:52.380
I'll be right back, buddy.

01:53.781 --> 01:57.551
[chirping and squawking]

01:58.952 --> 02:00.588
Dad, guess what!

02:00.621 --> 02:02.423
You two are gonna stay
out of the kitchen

02:02.456 --> 02:04.192
while me and your Mom have
this romantic dinner I made?

02:04.225 --> 02:05.593
What're we gonna eat?

02:05.626 --> 02:07.228
I already ordered you pizza.

02:07.261 --> 02:10.531
Dad, there's
a Sinornithosaurus outside.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.266
Okay, now you're just
making these names up.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.635
Sino-nither... what?

02:14.668 --> 02:15.936
Sinornithosaurus.

02:15.969 --> 02:17.671
It's a theropod.

02:17.705 --> 02:21.175
He built a nest because he
likes a girl Sinornithosaurus.

02:21.209 --> 02:23.177
But she didn't like it,
so she left.

02:23.211 --> 02:25.779
Well, you let him know there are
plenty of dinos in the sea.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.449
But that's not true.

02:28.482 --> 02:31.452
There are plenty of prehistoric
marine reptiles in the sea,

02:31.485 --> 02:32.853
not dinos.
[chuckle]

02:32.886 --> 02:33.921
Out you go.

02:33.954 --> 02:35.589
But Dad, we need
to help him.

02:35.623 --> 02:36.890
He's in love!

02:36.924 --> 02:38.859
[Sara] She didn't
like the nest, huh?

02:38.892 --> 02:41.195
Hey, Dad, remember when

02:41.229 --> 02:43.697
Mom came over to our place
on your first date?

02:43.731 --> 02:45.766
It didn't go so well
for me either.

02:45.799 --> 02:48.369
[chuckle]
No, it did not.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.307
Eva! Thanks for picking me up.
I don't have a car.

02:53.341 --> 02:55.409
You look great.
Thanks, Aman.

02:55.443 --> 02:56.444
You... look great too.

02:58.346 --> 03:01.382
[Mom] I'm so glad we're
finally able to get together.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.851
It's been so crazy with Dana,
and for you.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.887
Oh, your place is...

03:06.920 --> 03:08.689
...spacious.

03:08.722 --> 03:11.625
Yeah, I just moved in,
so I don't own a lotta stuff.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.794
Is Sara here?
She's at her Mom's house.

03:13.827 --> 03:15.729
Do you want a tour?
Sure.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.698
This is, uh...

03:19.032 --> 03:20.301
...all of it.

03:21.669 --> 03:24.405
Why don't we get going?
Good idea.

03:24.438 --> 03:25.639
'Kay...

03:28.476 --> 03:29.810
[Dana]
That's it!

03:29.843 --> 03:31.745
Just like Mom
didn't like your place,

03:31.779 --> 03:33.781
the girl Sinornithosaurus
didn't like the boy's nest!

03:33.814 --> 03:36.817
I wouldn't say Mom
didn't like my place.

03:36.850 --> 03:39.820
It just wasn't the most...
decorated?

03:39.853 --> 03:42.823
That's when Dad
really got into crafting.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.825
So the Sinornithosaurus

03:44.858 --> 03:46.894
just needs to
decorate his nest

03:46.927 --> 03:49.697
so the girl dino
will like it.

03:49.730 --> 03:52.533
Dad, can I borrow some of
your craft supplies?

03:52.566 --> 03:53.901
Sure, nugget.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.541
Aren't you going to
change for your dinner?

04:00.574 --> 04:02.443
What's wrong with this shirt?

04:02.476 --> 04:05.045
Other than that stain...
Oof! ...and the smell.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.680
[chuckle]

04:06.714 --> 04:09.016
Hey, Sinornithosaurus!

04:09.049 --> 04:10.751
Guess what?

04:10.784 --> 04:13.654
[chirping and squawking]

04:13.687 --> 04:15.289
Oh...

04:15.323 --> 04:18.326
Looks like someone's already
started decorating!

04:18.359 --> 04:20.328
Good idea,
Sinornithosaurus.

04:20.361 --> 04:22.796
You like blue,
so lemme see what I can find.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.765
[squeak]

04:24.798 --> 04:26.767
How about these
blue pom-poms?

04:26.800 --> 04:29.937
[chirping]

04:29.970 --> 04:31.572
Perfect.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.874
[squawking]

04:35.943 --> 04:38.379
Look, the girl's back!

04:38.412 --> 04:41.782
[both dinos squawking]

04:41.815 --> 04:43.851
Looks like she likes it.

04:47.087 --> 04:48.656
[sad squeak]

04:48.689 --> 04:50.324
She left again.

04:50.358 --> 04:51.792
[sad squeak]

04:53.861 --> 04:56.029
[sigh]
Don't give up.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.698
If my dad gave up,

04:57.731 --> 04:59.733
he and my mom never would've
gotten together.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.437
[sniff]

05:03.471 --> 05:04.538

05:04.572 --> 05:05.939

05:08.075 --> 05:11.845
[chirping and squawking]

05:16.850 --> 05:18.452
How does this look?

05:19.520 --> 05:21.555
It's terrible!

05:21.589 --> 05:23.056
It's not terrible.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.892
A little wrinkled,
maybe, but...

05:24.925 --> 05:26.494
Not your shirt.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.061
The girl Sinornithosaurus

05:28.095 --> 05:29.663
liked how he decorated the nest,

05:29.697 --> 05:31.031
but she left again.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.934
[giggle] Sounds like
your second date, Dad.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.636
That one was a bit better.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.038
Eva, come in!

05:39.607 --> 05:41.575
Thought you lost my number.
[chuckle]

05:41.609 --> 05:43.477
Sorry I took so long to call.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.846
Things have been so crazy
with Dana, and...

05:47.180 --> 05:49.783
Aman...
The place is so different!

05:49.817 --> 05:52.386
I really got into crafting.
Do you crochet?

05:52.420 --> 05:53.521
Uh, no.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.088
Oh, y'know what
else I got into?

05:55.122 --> 05:57.425
I'll give you a hint.
It's a musical instrument.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.793

Close.

06:30.958 --> 06:33.827
the Sinornithosaurus needs to
sing to the girl dino!

Oh no...

06:53.581 --> 06:54.948
Not the ukulele!

06:56.083 --> 06:57.918
I mean, um,
not the ukulele

06:57.951 --> 07:01.021
before I have a chance to
change out of my work clothes

07:01.054 --> 07:02.590
for our special dinner!

07:03.691 --> 07:05.125
How are you girls?

07:05.158 --> 07:06.727
Can't talk, Mom.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.829
Trying to help
a Sinornithosaurus fall in love.

07:08.862 --> 07:11.198
Dad, can I borrow
your ukulele?

07:11.231 --> 07:12.533
Yes!!

[Sinornithosaurus making

07:19.006 --> 07:21.942
Oh, sounds like someone's
already started singing!

07:23.644 --> 07:25.946
Good plan,
Sinornithosaurus.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.181
Lemme see if
I can help you.

07:31.218 --> 07:34.555

* Sinornithosaurus,
he really likes you *

07:38.258 --> 07:40.561
* Now sing the chorus

07:40.594 --> 07:43.531
[high-pitched squawking]

07:43.564 --> 07:46.600
It's working!
Let's keep singing.

07:46.634 --> 07:50.037
* Sinornithosaurus,
she really likes you *

07:50.070 --> 07:52.706
* Now sing the chorus...

07:52.740 --> 07:54.107

08:11.559 --> 08:13.761
Mom, Dad,
guess what?

08:13.794 --> 08:15.162
The singing worked!

08:15.195 --> 08:17.230
The Sinornithosaurus
built a cool nest,

08:17.264 --> 08:20.233
decorated it,
and sang to attract a girl!

08:20.267 --> 08:21.869
That reminds me
of something...

08:21.902 --> 08:23.270
Our third date?
No.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.238
[Mom]
There's a bird...

08:27.307 --> 08:29.276
Yeah...
That's it.

08:29.309 --> 08:31.278
The bower bird.
Come, watch this, Dana.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.214
Okay, so...

08:34.247 --> 08:36.216
The bower bird
attracts females

08:36.249 --> 08:38.686
by doing the same thing
your dino does.

08:38.719 --> 08:41.589
See? That's the male decorating
the nest for the female.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.256
That makes sense.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.025
Since birds came
from dinosaurs,

08:45.058 --> 08:47.194
they would've done
some of the same things.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.862
[Aman]
That's fascinating.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.230
Bye, Dana!

08:51.899 --> 08:53.567
Hi, Sara.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.235
You still didn't finish
telling the story

08:55.268 --> 08:57.037
of how you two
finally got together.

Haven't heard
from you in a while.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.589
Yeah, I've been busy.

Your Dad was
so good with you two.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.775
That's how I knew
he was the one.

That, girls, is what I like
to call "love at third sight."

10:11.378 --> 10:13.714

Now leave us alone.

12:12.365 --> 12:15.335
[woman] Dougie!
Dougie, where are you?

12:15.368 --> 12:17.104
It's my neighbor
Ms. Currie.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.106
I wonder what's wrong.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.975
Bye, buddies!
Want the last bite, bud?

12:22.009 --> 12:25.478
[squawking]

12:25.512 --> 12:27.214
[giggle]

12:28.315 --> 12:30.283
Dougie!

12:30.317 --> 12:32.352
Dougie, where are you?

12:32.385 --> 12:33.386
Dougie!

12:33.420 --> 12:34.988
Ms. Currie!!
[yelp]

12:35.022 --> 12:37.524
Dana you scared me
half to death...

12:37.557 --> 12:40.160
H-Hey, why're you
dressed as a Troodon?

12:40.193 --> 12:41.995
How did you know?

12:42.029 --> 12:47.000
Well, I used to play dinosaurs
with my grandsons all the time.

12:47.034 --> 12:49.002
[sigh]
But that was a long time ago.

12:49.036 --> 12:51.338
They're off to school now,
and they've got their friends,

12:51.371 --> 12:54.074
and grandma isn't so
hip and rad anymore.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.176
I'll play dinosaurs
with you, Ms. Currie.

12:56.209 --> 12:59.479
Oh, you're very sweet, honey,
but I gotta find Doug.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.815
Who's Doug?
That's him.

13:01.849 --> 13:03.817
He's not the smartest
dog in the world,

13:03.851 --> 13:05.118
but the boys love him.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.887
Anyway, I said
I would dog-sit him,

13:06.920 --> 13:09.189
and I didn't know he was
a little escape artist,

13:09.222 --> 13:11.258
and my grandson is gonna
be here in 15 minutes

13:11.291 --> 13:12.926
looking for his dog,

13:12.960 --> 13:15.195
and I'm gonna have to
tell him that I lost him!

13:15.228 --> 13:17.097
We can help you find him.
"We?"

13:17.130 --> 13:18.866
I'm in a pack of
Troodon today.

13:18.899 --> 13:21.034
But I don't know how
they track their prey.

13:21.068 --> 13:24.237
Oh, that sounds like
a dino experiment to me!

13:24.271 --> 13:25.873
No.
Oh.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.240
It's a dino
experiment update!

13:27.274 --> 13:29.409
Dino experiment
606 update:

13:29.442 --> 13:31.879
Troodons work together
to attack their prey,

13:31.912 --> 13:33.380
but how do
they find them?

13:33.413 --> 13:35.282
You want dinosaurs
to hunt Doug?

13:35.315 --> 13:37.450
No!
I want them to TRACK Doug.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.320
Tracking is when you follow
clues an animal left behind

13:40.353 --> 13:41.388
that'll lead you to it.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.056
Once we find Doug,

13:43.090 --> 13:44.925
I'll bring him back to
you and your grandson.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.560
Well, good luck, but remember
we only have 15 minutes!

13:47.594 --> 13:48.628
Don't worry,
Ms. Currie.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.230
Troodon are...
I know.

13:50.263 --> 13:51.865
One of the smartest
of dinosaurs!

13:51.899 --> 13:54.567
Oh, I miss all that dino play...

13:54.601 --> 13:56.436
Although my daughter doesn't.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.305
Oh, anyway,
here, take those.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.907
Those are Dougie's
favorite dog treats.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.042
If you see him,
those will lure him out.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.044
Thanks, Ms. Currie.
I won't let you down!

14:04.077 --> 14:05.412
"Squawk!"

14:05.445 --> 14:07.580
Oh, I know you won't, Dana.
"Squawk!"

14:07.614 --> 14:10.550
Dougie, you come back here,
you little Houdini!

14:12.219 --> 14:14.054
[Dana]
Troodon!

14:14.087 --> 14:17.090
Are you still hungry after
the fake Diabloceratop baby?

14:17.124 --> 14:18.291
[squawk]

14:18.325 --> 14:20.160
Do you wanna track
some new prey?

14:20.193 --> 14:22.262
We're looking for
a pug named Doug.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.197
And he looks
kinda like this...

14:24.231 --> 14:26.166
[squawk]
Whoa.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.135
That was fast.

14:29.202 --> 14:34.141
[***]

14:35.208 --> 14:37.677
Squawwwwwwk!

14:37.710 --> 14:39.412
Squawwwk!

14:39.446 --> 14:41.581
[squawking]

14:41.614 --> 14:44.017
Why did you stop?
What do you see?

14:44.051 --> 14:45.252
[squawk]

14:45.285 --> 14:48.255
Paw prints!
They must belong to Doug.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.257
But there's only
one way to find out.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.592
We have to...
[squawk]

14:52.625 --> 14:54.394
I was just about
to say that.

14:54.427 --> 14:55.895
...follow them!

15:00.400 --> 15:02.202
Squawwwwwk!

15:03.270 --> 15:04.972
Squawwwwwk!

15:05.005 --> 15:07.240
Squawwwwwk!

15:09.009 --> 15:10.443
Paw prints end here.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.980
Now how're we going to
track Doug?

15:13.013 --> 15:14.581
[Ms. Currie]
Dougie!

15:14.614 --> 15:16.649
Stay right here,
Troodon.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.218
"Squawwwk!"

15:20.253 --> 15:22.089
Ms. Currie!

15:22.122 --> 15:23.991
Ms. Currie,
you won't believe it!

15:24.024 --> 15:25.158
You found Doug?

15:25.192 --> 15:26.593
No, but I discovered that

15:26.626 --> 15:28.996
Troodons follow paw prints
to track their prey.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.397
Well, that's great, dear.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.065
It was great,

15:32.099 --> 15:34.567
until Doug's paw prints
ended in some grass.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.668
Oh...

15:35.702 --> 15:37.537
Hey, maybe your
dino friends

15:37.570 --> 15:39.672
will find a way
to sniff him out.

15:39.706 --> 15:42.375
That's it.
Ms. Currie, you're a genius!

15:42.409 --> 15:44.144
I am?
You are!

15:44.177 --> 15:45.545
Your theory is
that Troodons

15:45.578 --> 15:47.614
might use their noses
to track their prey.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.382
Well, that's not
what I was saying,

15:49.416 --> 15:51.151
but as long as
it's helpful, dear.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.220
Okay, so we have like
maybe ten minutes

15:53.253 --> 15:55.088
before my grandson shows up,

15:55.122 --> 15:57.190
and he's gonna be
really sad!

15:57.224 --> 15:58.458
Don't worry, Ms. Currie.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.293
We'll track down Doug.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.195
Troodon snout promise!

16:03.596 --> 16:05.232
Just tap your nose here.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.200
Oh, okay, good.
Cool.

16:07.234 --> 16:08.668
Thanks!

16:08.701 --> 16:10.537
Okay... Dougie!

16:10.570 --> 16:14.074
Dougie, where are you,
you cute little ugly monster?

16:14.107 --> 16:16.043
Doug the Pug!!

16:19.446 --> 16:22.282
[Troodons sniffing ground]

16:22.315 --> 16:24.051
Squawwwwwk!

16:25.118 --> 16:27.454
Squawwwwwk!

16:27.487 --> 16:29.156
[chirp]

16:29.189 --> 16:31.724
What do you smell, Troodon?
What is it?

16:32.792 --> 16:34.661
Ewww!

16:34.694 --> 16:36.763
Dog's droppings?

16:36.796 --> 16:39.632
[sniffing]

16:39.666 --> 16:42.235
Why're you smelling the air?

16:42.269 --> 16:45.205
Oh... now that you know
what Doug smells like,

16:45.238 --> 16:47.174
can you follow the smell?

16:47.207 --> 16:49.376
[squawk]
You can!

16:49.409 --> 16:51.544
Wait up,
Troodon!

16:51.578 --> 16:53.680
I should pick this up
before I go...

16:57.750 --> 16:59.786
[Dougie panting]

16:59.819 --> 17:01.754
[dogs barking]

17:02.822 --> 17:04.691
[Troodons sniffing]

17:04.724 --> 17:06.359
Squawwwwwwk!

17:07.427 --> 17:09.062
Squawwwwwwk!

17:10.130 --> 17:13.266
[Troodons squawking]

17:13.300 --> 17:16.636
You lost the smell.
Now how're we gonna track Doug?

17:16.669 --> 17:18.338
[Ms. Currie]
Dougie!

17:18.371 --> 17:21.208
I'll be right back, Troodon.
"Squawwwk!"

17:21.241 --> 17:23.543
[Troodons squawking]

17:23.576 --> 17:25.412
Doug!

17:25.445 --> 17:27.280
Dougie!

17:27.314 --> 17:29.149
[weary]
Dougie...

17:29.182 --> 17:30.550
Ms. Currie!

17:30.583 --> 17:33.153
Oh, Dana,
there's no hope.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.587
Yes, there is!
Look!

17:34.621 --> 17:36.856
Blech!
Is that what I think it is?

17:36.889 --> 17:38.558
Yes-- evidence
that the troodon

17:38.591 --> 17:40.693
used their sense of smell
to track their prey.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.295
Your theory was right!

17:42.329 --> 17:43.296
That's great, Dana.

17:43.330 --> 17:45.232
Well, it WAS great,

17:45.265 --> 17:48.468
until we lost Doug's smell
'cause we ran into another dog.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.470
[sigh]
Oh well, we tried.

17:50.503 --> 17:53.140
[sigh] I guess I'm just
not gonna be seeing

17:53.173 --> 17:54.674
very much of my
grandson anymore.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.543
Don't give up,
Ms. Currie.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.811
What else did your grandson
tell you about Troodon?

17:58.845 --> 18:00.680
Um... well,

18:00.713 --> 18:03.683
that they're smart,
and they hunt in packs,

18:03.716 --> 18:06.153
and they talk to each other.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.621
That's it!
Ms. Currie, you're a genius.

18:08.655 --> 18:10.323
I am?
You are!

18:10.357 --> 18:12.659
Your theory is that since
troodon talk to each other,

18:12.692 --> 18:15.195
they might use their ears
to track down their prey.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.696
Paleontologists
think that Troodon had

18:16.729 --> 18:19.399
a better sense of hearing
than most dinosaurs.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.768
Oh.
Alright, well here, good luck.

18:21.801 --> 18:24.237
And remember that we
only have five minutes

18:24.271 --> 18:27.174
before Grandma only gets
visitors on holidays.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.842
Don't worry, Ms. Currie.
We'll listen for Doug!

18:29.876 --> 18:31.911
Oh, you're
a sweetheart...

18:31.944 --> 18:33.746
Yeah, I'm never
gonna find him.

18:34.814 --> 18:39.219
[Dougie panting]

18:39.252 --> 18:41.621
[Troodons squawking]

18:44.424 --> 18:45.692
Did you hear something,
Troodon?

18:47.260 --> 18:50.463
You did...
[gasp] You found Doug!

18:50.497 --> 18:52.732
Great job,
Troodon.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.567
Oh no.

18:54.601 --> 18:57.404
Now that you've tracked Doug,
you're going to attack!

18:57.437 --> 18:58.805
Think, Dana, think,

18:58.838 --> 19:01.808
or Doug will be
a tasty dino treat.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.811
Wait, that's it--
Treats!

19:04.844 --> 19:07.680
Hey, Troodon...

19:07.714 --> 19:09.416
Treats...

19:09.449 --> 19:10.683
Go get 'em!

19:10.717 --> 19:12.885
"Squawwwwk!"

19:12.919 --> 19:15.788
They're distracted.
I know what I have to do.

19:17.290 --> 19:21.528
[Troodons chittering
and squawking]

19:21.561 --> 19:24.531
Hey, where did that
little doggy go?

19:24.564 --> 19:27.500
I dunno, 'cause it's just us
Troodon here in the park.

19:30.770 --> 19:33.606
You two better go find
something else to eat.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.575
[squawking]

19:37.344 --> 19:39.379
Hi, Doug.
I'm Dana.

19:39.412 --> 19:40.780
You're save now.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.749
Let's get you back
to Ms. Currie.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.753
Hey, Grandma,
where's Dougie?

19:46.786 --> 19:48.888
Oh, bud,
I got some bad news.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.590
Dougie's--
Right here!

19:50.623 --> 19:52.292
Dougie!

19:54.026 --> 19:56.263
Trek?
Dana?

19:56.296 --> 19:57.664
Wait, you two
know each other?

19:57.697 --> 19:59.766
Yeah, I gave Dana my
old dino field guide.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.868
Wait, YOU'RE
Trek's Grandma?

20:01.901 --> 20:03.670
Yep!

20:03.703 --> 20:06.306
You're part of some of his
most famous dino experiments!

20:06.339 --> 20:09.242
You helped Trek figure out
if pterosaurs fly in a flock,

20:09.276 --> 20:11.244
why the Psittacosaurus
swallows rocks,

20:11.278 --> 20:13.012
and how the Spinosaurus
learns to fish!

20:13.045 --> 20:14.714
That was a good one.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.549
Oh, I do miss
those, Trekkie.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.850
Me too.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.486
Y'know...

20:19.519 --> 20:22.655
I haven't fully completed
dino experiment 606.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.991
I know how Troodon attack,
and how they track,

20:25.024 --> 20:27.394
but I don't know how
they chose their packs.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.629
Sounds like a fun
dino experiment to me!

20:29.662 --> 20:31.498
Yes, it does.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.900
C'mon, guys, let's go
find ourselves some Troodons!

20:33.933 --> 20:36.269
Alrighty...
[Dana] Squawk!

20:36.303 --> 20:39.739
