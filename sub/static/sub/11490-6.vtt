00:06.300 --> 00:07.530
Oh, hey, Alan.

00:07.600 --> 00:09.560
Jake, your dad's here.

00:10.630 --> 00:12.230
So, how's it going?

00:12.300 --> 00:13.560
All good.

00:13.630 --> 00:14.960
Good.

00:15.030 --> 00:16.530
You?
Good.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.260
Well, good.

00:18.800 --> 00:21.260
Yeah, good.

00:24.560 --> 00:26.560
Gooood.

00:29.900 --> 00:32.229
Well, I, uh, I see you
put in a new mailbox.

00:32.299 --> 00:34.500
Oh, yeah, the old one
was pretty shoddy.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.960
Whoever put it in didn't
anchor the pole correctly.

00:37.030 --> 00:39.060
That would be me.

00:39.130 --> 00:40.760
Oh, sorry.

00:40.830 --> 00:42.900
The mailman was complaining
about the wiggle.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.830
Herb, the mailman's a pothead.

00:44.900 --> 00:47.630
Yeah, I know. I caught him
eating my tomato plants.

00:47.700 --> 00:50.130
Anyway, I just decided
to replace the whole thing.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.930
Yeah, I see it, uh,
it now says "The Melnicks."

00:53.000 --> 00:55.100
Well, I paid for the mailbox.

00:56.560 --> 00:58.130
I get my mail there.

00:58.200 --> 00:59.460
My name's Melnick...

00:59.530 --> 01:00.460
Yeah, I... I get it.

01:00.530 --> 01:02.500
I mean, what does it
say on your mailbox?

01:02.560 --> 01:04.500
Charlie Harper.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.500
Oh.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.930
Jake!

01:09.000 --> 01:11.800
No need to yell.
He's in the bathroom.

01:11.860 --> 01:13.400
Big surprise, eh?

01:13.460 --> 01:15.830
He's either shoveling it in
or shooting it out.

01:15.900 --> 01:20.060
Yeah, he's a regular Play-Doh
fun factory.

01:20.130 --> 01:22.430
Just go make sure he hasn't
fallen asleep in there again.

01:22.500 --> 01:23.500
Yes, dear.

01:25.230 --> 01:27.300
So, how's everything?

01:27.360 --> 01:28.960
Fine.

01:29.030 --> 01:31.730
Listen, Alan, I've been thinking
now that Jake's a teenager,

01:31.800 --> 01:34.100
he'd benefit from spending
some more time with his dad.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.030
Oh, oh, that would be great.

01:36.100 --> 01:37.360
Nothing would make me happier

01:37.430 --> 01:38.930
than to spending more time
with my son.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.600
Good.

01:40.660 --> 01:41.530
Hey, Dad.

01:41.600 --> 01:42.530
Oh, hey, buddy.

01:42.600 --> 01:43.560
All finished
in the bathroom?

01:43.630 --> 01:44.730
For now.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.200
You should've
seen the last one.

01:46.260 --> 01:47.860
It looked like
a question mark.

01:50.260 --> 01:51.200
Terrific.

01:51.260 --> 01:52.930
And it came out of my colon.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.030
Get it?

01:54.100 --> 01:55.300
Hilarious.

01:55.360 --> 01:56.360
Commas are easy.

01:56.430 --> 01:57.930
Go.

01:59.260 --> 02:03.130
Um, so, uh, what are we
talking about here?

02:03.200 --> 02:04.860
You know, an extra day or two
every other week?

02:04.930 --> 02:07.130
Actually, I was thinking more
like a solid three months.

02:07.200 --> 02:08.400
In a row?

02:08.460 --> 02:10.199
Alan, how many sons do you have?

02:10.259 --> 02:11.530
As many as you do.

02:11.600 --> 02:12.960
Look, do you want
your kid or not?

02:13.030 --> 02:16.560
Of course, but... well, I'll
have to clear it with Charlie,

02:16.630 --> 02:19.330
and... and there is
the financial issue.

02:19.400 --> 02:20.760
What financial issue?

02:20.830 --> 02:22.160
Well, if he's going
to be living with me,

02:22.230 --> 02:23.160
I'm thinking I should
get a sizeable break

02:23.230 --> 02:24.360
on the child support.

02:24.430 --> 02:26.260
Well, you're certainly entitled
to your opinion.

02:26.330 --> 02:27.300
Well, thank you.

Wait a minute.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.360
Three months in a row?!

02:41.430 --> 02:44.100
Come on.
It'll be fun.
For who?

02:44.160 --> 02:46.730
All he does is eat, sleep
and clog up the toilets.

02:46.800 --> 02:47.800
Shh!

02:47.860 --> 02:49.130
Let's talk
about this later.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.160
Oh, please, chowderhead
can't hear us.

02:51.230 --> 02:52.260
Right, chowderhead?

02:53.760 --> 02:55.030
See?

02:55.100 --> 02:58.130
Oh, just admit it:
you love having him around.

02:58.200 --> 03:01.800
I love having him around because
I always know he's leaving.

03:01.860 --> 03:04.960
Don't take the leaving part
away from me, Alan.

03:05.030 --> 03:06.600
Let's just give it a chance.

03:06.660 --> 03:07.830
See how it works.

03:07.900 --> 03:09.900
That's what Poland said
about the Germans.

03:09.960 --> 03:12.600
Been watching
the History Channel again?

03:12.660 --> 03:14.600
It's Nazi week.

03:14.660 --> 03:16.760
It's always Nazi week.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.160
Look, tell you what,

03:18.230 --> 03:20.260
why don't I take you and Jake
out to dinner tonight?

03:20.330 --> 03:22.330
Can we get chili burgers?

So, numbnuts...

04:01.600 --> 04:03.900
Any thoughts as to why your mom
dumped you off on us?

04:03.960 --> 04:05.000
Charlie.

04:05.060 --> 04:06.530
Oh, like you're not curious.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.530
No! No, I'm not curious.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.200
She just thought
it would be a good idea

04:10.260 --> 04:11.660
for him to spend more time
with his father.

04:11.730 --> 04:13.160
Yeah, and I'm trying
to save girls

04:13.230 --> 04:15.700
a long ride home on the freeway.

04:16.930 --> 04:19.500
So what's your theory, Alfalfa?

04:19.560 --> 04:21.329
I think you're just pretending
to be considerate

04:21.399 --> 04:22.900
so you can have sex with them.

04:27.160 --> 04:30.200
No, no, I mean
about your mother and Herb.

04:30.260 --> 04:31.200
Oh.

04:31.260 --> 04:32.530
They are fighting a lot.

04:32.600 --> 04:33.430
They're fighting?

04:33.500 --> 04:34.460
Yep.

04:34.530 --> 04:36.130
31.

04:37.100 --> 04:38.400
31?

04:38.460 --> 04:42.000
It's what you get when you add
24 and seven.

04:44.130 --> 04:46.600
You know, they're fighting
all the time.

04:46.660 --> 04:47.760
24/7.

04:47.830 --> 04:49.900
31.

04:49.960 --> 04:53.060
I'm not gonna make it
three months, Alan.

04:53.130 --> 04:54.030
You're gonna be fine.

04:54.100 --> 04:55.330
They're fighting
in front of you?

04:55.400 --> 04:56.960
They don't think
they're fighting in front of me

04:57.030 --> 04:58.400
'cause sometimes when
I wear the headphones,

04:58.460 --> 04:59.460
I turn the music off.

05:00.860 --> 05:02.600
And you figured that out
all by yourself?

05:02.660 --> 05:05.660
Hey, you may think I'm dumb,
but you overestimate me.

05:07.630 --> 05:10.230
My mistake.

05:10.300 --> 05:11.900
So what are they arguing about?

05:11.960 --> 05:13.900
Well, she doesn't
like his parents,

05:13.960 --> 05:15.930
he doesn't like her spending,
and something about sex.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.330
What about sex?

05:18.930 --> 05:21.430
That's when I turn the music
back on, you sick freak.

05:25.900 --> 05:26.960
Sorry.

05:27.030 --> 05:28.900
I mean, that's my mother.

05:28.960 --> 05:30.930
I said I'm sorry.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.630
Man, I'm not gonna make it
three months.

05:35.030 --> 05:38.330
<i>Oh, great, now he's got
the moral high ground.</i>

05:39.900 --> 05:41.200
Forget about that.

05:41.260 --> 05:42.700
The important thing is,

05:42.760 --> 05:46.530
Judith and Herb are having
marital problems.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.630
Why does that make you happy?

05:48.700 --> 05:50.560
Well, it's not happiness
exactly.

05:50.630 --> 05:51.700
It's just that, you know,

05:51.760 --> 05:53.330
<i>all these years
she's been blaming me</i>

05:53.400 --> 05:57.000
for the failure of our marriage,
and now...

05:57.060 --> 06:00.730
Yeah, I guess happiness
pretty much sums it up.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.960
* Men. *

06:04.360 --> 06:06.200
Hey, what's this I hear

06:06.260 --> 06:10.130
about Little Lord Skidmark
coming to live here full time?

06:10.200 --> 06:12.130
Oh, it's just for a few weeks.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.660
I'm sure
if we all pull together,

06:13.730 --> 06:15.200
you'll hardly even notice
he's here.

06:15.260 --> 06:17.230
Yeah, pull this.

06:18.930 --> 06:20.200
Charlie!

06:20.260 --> 06:22.930
You and me gotta
have a conversation.

06:25.360 --> 06:26.700
Nice talking to you.

06:27.930 --> 06:30.500
(doorbell rings)

06:30.560 --> 06:32.500
Hey, Alan.
Oh, hey, Herb.

06:32.560 --> 06:34.530
Judith asked me to drop
this stuff off for Jake.

06:34.600 --> 06:35.730
Oh, let me help you.

06:35.800 --> 06:38.730
Thanks.

06:38.800 --> 06:38.860
So, what have you two lovebirds
got planned

06:42.560 --> 06:43.830
for the next few months?

06:43.900 --> 06:45.800
Second honeymoon?

06:45.860 --> 06:47.300
No, not exactly.

06:47.360 --> 06:50.760
Hard to believe you're coming up
on your second anniversary.

06:50.830 --> 06:52.060
Yep. Hard to believe.

06:52.130 --> 06:54.430
Two years.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.730
Time flies
when you're having fun, eh?

06:57.800 --> 06:59.800
I wouldn't know.

07:01.560 --> 07:02.700
Hey, Herb.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.060
Hey, Charlie.

07:04.130 --> 07:06.930
You ask him about his marriage
going down the crapper?

07:10.560 --> 07:12.260
I was easing into it.

07:12.330 --> 07:14.360
So was I.

07:14.430 --> 07:15.760
What's the problem, Herb?

07:15.830 --> 07:17.130
Is it in the bedroom?

07:17.200 --> 07:18.930
It usually starts
in the bedroom.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.260
That's still my mother,
you sick freak!

07:22.330 --> 07:24.730
We usually wait till
he puts on headphones

07:24.800 --> 07:26.360
before we discuss
these things.

07:26.430 --> 07:28.760
Gee, Herb, something
you should know

07:28.830 --> 07:29.800
about the headphones is...

07:29.860 --> 07:32.430
Shh, shh!
Don't spoil it.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.430
So what's the deal?
Is it sex?

07:34.500 --> 07:36.930
No.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.630
Well, yeah, but...
it's no big deal.

07:39.700 --> 07:41.900
I mean every marriage
has an ebb and flow to it.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.260
Of course.
Sure. Sure.

07:43.330 --> 07:46.630
Right now Judith and I
are kind of ebbing.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.530
A lot.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.830
31.

07:52.360 --> 07:53.960
Right.

07:54.030 --> 07:56.130
31.

07:56.200 --> 07:57.460
I don't know
what's happening, man.

07:57.530 --> 07:59.130
We can't seem
to communicate anymore.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.960
She constantly
finds fault with me.

08:01.030 --> 08:02.160
I don't know
what to do.

08:02.230 --> 08:03.830
I'll tell you
what to do.

08:03.900 --> 08:07.630
What my testicle-challenged
brother should have done.

08:07.700 --> 08:09.260
As soon as
she starts complaining,

08:09.330 --> 08:10.400
you put your foot down.

08:10.460 --> 08:11.830
Let her know who's in charge.

08:11.900 --> 08:14.460
And no matter what, do not
let her use sex as a weapon.

08:14.530 --> 08:16.300
You let her know that if she
won't satisfy your needs,

08:16.360 --> 08:17.830
there's plenty of women
out there who will.

08:17.900 --> 08:18.630
Really?

08:18.700 --> 08:20.660
Why would I lie?

08:22.160 --> 08:26.000
Women like Judith respond to
strength and confidence, not...

08:26.060 --> 08:29.830
well, that.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.659
Oh, you make a compelling case.

08:32.730 --> 08:33.700
Damn right I do.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.200
Now go claim what's yours.

08:35.260 --> 08:36.960
I believe I will.

08:37.030 --> 08:38.030
Thanks, Charlie.

08:39.299 --> 08:41.299
I'm here for you, big guy.

08:43.159 --> 08:44.430
Why did you do that?

08:44.500 --> 08:46.430
I get bored.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.000
* Men. *

08:54.100 --> 08:56.100
Hey.
Hey.

08:58.430 --> 09:00.360
Why aren't you in school?

09:00.430 --> 09:01.700
I'm sick.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.730
Sick?

09:03.800 --> 09:07.060
Relax, I'm just faking
to get out of a math test.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.660
Oh, okay, good.

09:09.730 --> 09:11.130
You scared me.

09:11.200 --> 09:12.960
What's with the staple gun?

09:13.030 --> 09:15.630
Oh, the sole's coming
off my shoe.

09:16.630 --> 09:18.460
Ah.

09:18.530 --> 09:20.700
You might want
to take it off first.

09:22.360 --> 09:23.860
Good call.

09:30.830 --> 09:31.760
Morning.

09:31.830 --> 09:33.030
(staple gun clacking)

09:33.100 --> 09:34.900
It's none of my business,
but that's one kid

09:34.960 --> 09:38.430
who can't afford to miss
a single day of school.

09:38.500 --> 09:39.760
(staple gun clacking)

09:39.830 --> 09:43.830
Yeah, like school's
gonna make a difference.

09:45.060 --> 09:47.160
(staple gun clacking)
JAKE:
Ow! Crap!

09:48.630 --> 09:51.830
I stapled my fingers together.

09:51.900 --> 09:54.300
You got a point.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.430
* Men. *

10:00.500 --> 10:02.430
Come on, honey. Blow.

10:02.500 --> 10:03.830
(blowing nose)

10:08.060 --> 10:10.060
(muffled):
What's he got?

10:10.130 --> 10:12.030
A cold, I think.

10:12.100 --> 10:13.560
Then why didn't you
leave him at home?

10:14.830 --> 10:16.730
That way, we all don't
have to get sick.

10:16.800 --> 10:18.460
(coughing)

10:20.200 --> 10:21.760
And that's why
you should always
take your shoes

10:21.830 --> 10:22.930
to a fully qualified,
professional cobbler.

10:23.000 --> 10:26.900
You know what's good?
Apple cobbler.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.660
What's the damage, doc?

10:28.730 --> 10:31.430
Will he play
the violin again?

10:31.500 --> 10:32.700
He'll be fine.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.560
You might wanna keep him away
from staple guns.

10:34.630 --> 10:35.560
Right.

10:35.630 --> 10:37.130
Also nail guns,
glue guns,

10:37.200 --> 10:39.130
pretty much anything
with "gun" in it.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.560
Got it.
Thanks, Herb.

10:43.300 --> 10:45.100
Hey, Charlie, could I talk
for you a sec?

10:45.160 --> 10:47.100
Why don't you go wait
for me in the car?

10:47.160 --> 10:48.060
Gimme the keys.

10:48.130 --> 10:50.000
I'm not giving you the keys.

10:50.060 --> 10:51.500
Then how am I gonna wait
in the car?

10:51.560 --> 10:53.300
<i>Wait by the car.</i>

10:53.360 --> 10:56.260
I don't have sunscreen on.
I'm very fair-skinned.

10:56.330 --> 10:58.830
<i>Then wait under the car.</i>

11:02.000 --> 11:03.160
What's up?

11:03.230 --> 11:05.130
Well, remember that advice
you gave me

11:05.200 --> 11:06.460
about how
to handle Judith?

11:06.530 --> 11:08.900
Oh, gee, Herb,
that wasn't so much advice

11:08.960 --> 11:11.130
as, you know, social satire.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.960
Well, it worked
out great.

11:13.030 --> 11:14.160
Really?

11:14.230 --> 11:16.100
She bought
that king-of-the-castle crap?

11:16.160 --> 11:18.260
No, no, she kicked my ass out.

11:18.330 --> 11:20.130
But the thing is,
talking with you

11:20.200 --> 11:21.430
and seeing how you live,

11:21.500 --> 11:23.130
I'm convinced
I'm better off single.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.360
Is that so?

11:24.430 --> 11:26.760
Oh, yeah. I mean,
why chew on one chicken wing

11:26.830 --> 11:28.930
when you can eat
from the whole bucket?

11:29.000 --> 11:31.500
Just so there's no confusion.

11:31.560 --> 11:33.130
Chicken wings are...?

11:33.200 --> 11:34.800
Women, Charlie.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.330
I was offering up a metaphor.

11:36.400 --> 11:39.830
And you went with wings
rather than breasts and thighs.

11:39.900 --> 11:43.960
<i>Ooh, that is better.</i>

11:44.030 --> 11:46.630
Anyway, I was thinking maybe
you and I can go out sometime

11:46.700 --> 11:48.700
and get a party pack.

11:49.930 --> 11:51.360
Sex with strange women.

11:51.430 --> 11:53.300
I'm extending the metaphor.

11:53.360 --> 11:55.900
Of course.
Sure, let's do that sometime.

11:55.960 --> 11:58.030
Thanks again for
sewing up the kid.

11:58.100 --> 11:59.830
So, uh, what color
do you like?

11:59.900 --> 12:01.160
Excuse me?

12:03.530 --> 12:06.560
Oh, I-I was thinking Asian,
but I'll take the green.

12:08.300 --> 12:09.800
* Men. *

12:16.330 --> 12:17.260
Hey, Dad..

12:17.330 --> 12:18.200
Oh, hey.
How are you feeling?

12:18.260 --> 12:19.200
Fine.

12:19.260 --> 12:20.400
Throat's not sore anymore?

12:20.460 --> 12:24.260
(coughs)
Oh, yeah, a little.

12:24.330 --> 12:26.960
What happened to your fingers?

12:27.030 --> 12:29.430
Oh, I stapled 'em together.

12:31.900 --> 12:33.830
Ah.

12:33.900 --> 12:39.800
<i>Hey, hey, we do not leave
our shoes on the...</i>

12:44.630 --> 12:45.760
What the hell?

12:48.360 --> 12:53.030
We need to get rid
of the staple gun.

12:53.100 --> 12:55.830
Alan, staple guns don't staple
shoes to coffee tables.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.760
Idiots do.

12:59.000 --> 13:00.900
Why are you taking
your temperature?

13:00.960 --> 13:05.430
I think some little snot locker
gave me smallpox.

13:05.500 --> 13:08.700
(phone rings)

13:08.760 --> 13:11.530
Oh, man, leave me alone.

13:11.600 --> 13:13.530
Is that Mom?

13:13.600 --> 13:15.160
You think maybe I might want
to talk to her?

13:15.230 --> 13:16.530
Do you?

13:16.600 --> 13:18.200
Of course not.
It's the principle.

13:18.260 --> 13:21.430
Well, that wasn't Mom.
It was Herb.

13:21.500 --> 13:22.630
Why is Herb calling?

13:22.700 --> 13:24.560
Since Judith
threw him out,

13:24.630 --> 13:26.600
he wants me to help
him pick up women.

13:26.660 --> 13:29.760
Wait.
Backupbackupbackupbackup
backupbackup!

13:29.830 --> 13:32.230
Wait. Judith threw Herb out?
When?

13:32.300 --> 13:35.030
I don't know.
Apparently, about a week ago.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.930
Oh, my God.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.830
That's terrible.

13:38.900 --> 13:41.460
<i>Judith must be
devastated.</i>

13:47.060 --> 13:47.900
Alan.

13:47.960 --> 13:48.960
Yeah?

13:49.030 --> 13:50.800
You got a little evil
on your face.

13:52.800 --> 13:54.000
Other side.

13:56.300 --> 13:59.400
* Men. *

14:01.160 --> 14:03.430
Oh, Judith, that's terrible.

14:03.500 --> 14:05.860
You must be devastated.

14:09.160 --> 14:11.260
<i>You must be devastated.</i>

14:14.130 --> 14:15.660
What are
you doing here?

14:15.730 --> 14:16.960
Oh, I'm sorry to bother you.

14:17.030 --> 14:19.100
Apparently, Jake left
his Social Studies book,

14:19.160 --> 14:20.160
so here I am.

14:20.230 --> 14:22.260
I think I saw it
in the bathroom.

14:22.330 --> 14:24.660
Why?
Was he out of toilet paper?

14:27.460 --> 14:31.300
Wouldn't it be great
if he could learn that way?

14:31.360 --> 14:34.160
You know, assmosis.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.260
What?

14:36.330 --> 14:37.760
Nothing.

14:37.830 --> 14:39.730
Is Herb around?

14:39.800 --> 14:41.530
Uh, no.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.660
Oh. Oh, too bad.

14:43.730 --> 14:44.930
Why?

14:45.000 --> 14:46.060
No reason.

14:46.130 --> 14:48.660
I just enjoy seeing
the big galoot.

14:48.730 --> 14:51.160
Well, the galoot is not here.

14:51.230 --> 14:53.700
Oh. Well, uh...

14:53.760 --> 14:55.300
tell him I said hi.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.200
I will.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.330
(sobbing)

15:02.400 --> 15:04.700
Herb moved out!

15:04.760 --> 15:08.060
Our marriage is over!

15:08.130 --> 15:10.630
Oh, Judith, that's terrible.

15:15.460 --> 15:18.000
You must be devastated.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.300
* Men. *

15:29.360 --> 15:31.530
What exactly do
you have in mind?

15:31.600 --> 15:32.730
Give me your hand.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.530
Okay.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.060
Do I feel warm to you?

15:37.560 --> 15:38.600
Dude!

15:38.660 --> 15:41.100
Aw, crap.

15:41.160 --> 15:44.130
So, uh, you fishing here or can
I throw my bobber in the water?

15:46.760 --> 15:48.930
Bye.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.900
How'd you know I was here?

15:52.960 --> 15:53.930
Well, I tried calling,

15:54.000 --> 15:55.300
but your phone
must be broken,

15:55.360 --> 15:57.800
so I went by your house
and Jake said you went out.

15:57.860 --> 15:59.630
All I had to do
was punch "liquor"

15:59.700 --> 16:01.160
into the ol' in-dash
navigation system,

16:01.230 --> 16:03.500
and three stops
later, voila.

16:03.560 --> 16:07.500
So, uh, they
biting tonight?

16:07.560 --> 16:09.100
can we stop
with the fish talk?

16:09.160 --> 16:11.260
Believe me, it's not
gonna lead anyplace good.

16:11.330 --> 16:12.900
Back to the chickens?

16:12.960 --> 16:15.200
If we must.

16:15.260 --> 16:16.900
I'll have what he's having.

16:16.960 --> 16:20.160
I'm having a tall
Pain in the Ass.

16:20.230 --> 16:21.200
Sounds good.

16:21.260 --> 16:24.060
Does it have rum in it?

16:24.130 --> 16:26.600
How did this happen?

16:26.660 --> 16:28.260
How did I blow
another marriage?

16:28.330 --> 16:30.060
Oh, sweetie, you can't
blame yourself.

16:30.130 --> 16:32.500
Although you are the
common denominator.

16:32.560 --> 16:35.630
Alan, I'm 40 years old.

16:35.700 --> 16:37.330
How am I ever gonna
start over again?

16:37.400 --> 16:38.700
I know, I know.

16:38.760 --> 16:42.130
And soon you're gonna be 41.

16:42.200 --> 16:43.930
Do you have any idea
what it's like

16:44.000 --> 16:46.230
to try and date
when all the men your age

16:46.300 --> 16:48.530
are only interested in
25-year-old hard bodies?

16:48.600 --> 16:49.930
Well, you can't blame us.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.400
Of course, you can't compete
hard body to hard body,

16:55.460 --> 16:57.360
but you're still
a very desirable woman.

16:57.430 --> 16:59.400
You think so?

16:59.460 --> 17:01.860
Well, of course I do.

17:01.930 --> 17:05.030
For your age,
you're a very...

17:11.829 --> 17:14.300
Hey, Charlie, I've got
a question for you.

17:14.359 --> 17:16.230
Yeah.

17:16.300 --> 17:18.760
The hotel I'm staying in
has pay-per-view adult movies.

17:18.829 --> 17:19.800
Uh-huh?

17:19.859 --> 17:22.900
Whatever happened
to pubic hair?

17:22.960 --> 17:27.630
Gone the way of the dodo bird,
my friend.

17:27.700 --> 17:29.960
I mean, I can understand
with the ladies,

17:30.030 --> 17:32.200
but what's the deal
with the fellas?

17:32.260 --> 17:33.630
It's like with
an ugly house.

17:33.700 --> 17:36.960
A little shrubbery
helps the curb appeal.

17:37.030 --> 17:40.060
I don't have an answer
for you, Herb.

17:40.130 --> 17:42.260
What about you?

17:42.330 --> 17:43.560
Do you trim the old hedges?

17:43.630 --> 17:46.300
Yeah. They're shaped
like Disney characters.

17:46.360 --> 17:48.860
Two more vodka tonics.

17:48.930 --> 17:51.460
Cock-a-doodle-do.

17:52.930 --> 17:53.830
Hello.

17:53.900 --> 17:55.200
Hello.

17:55.260 --> 17:56.660
Allow me to
introduce myself.

17:56.730 --> 17:57.460
Dr. Herbert Melnick.

17:57.530 --> 17:58.600
Ooh, a doctor.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.430
Dr. Charlie Harper.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.530
Wow, two doctors.

18:02.600 --> 18:05.460
Maybe we should
let them examine us.

18:05.530 --> 18:06.530
(both giggle)

18:06.600 --> 18:09.430
In the interest
of full disclosure,

18:09.500 --> 18:12.100
I should let you know
that I'm new to the dating world

18:12.160 --> 18:15.030
and still have all
my original pubic hair.

18:17.200 --> 18:21.700
Oh, Alan, why did
I ever let you go?

18:21.760 --> 18:24.460
Well, if I recall,

18:24.530 --> 18:28.030
it was something about me
sucking the life out of you.

18:28.100 --> 18:31.400
I was wrong.
I was so wrong.

18:31.460 --> 18:35.400
You are a good man
and I'm never gonna
let you go again.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.660
Never?

18:39.730 --> 18:41.030
Never.

18:42.060 --> 18:44.060
Never ever?

19:09.530 --> 19:11.500
Morning.

19:12.530 --> 19:14.160
Morning.

19:29.900 --> 19:32.060
What was Herb
doing here?

19:32.130 --> 19:34.300
Oh, he, uh...

19:37.600 --> 19:39.860
(rock music blaring)

19:41.730 --> 19:43.360
(music stops playing)

19:43.430 --> 19:46.360
He shaved his pubes
and passed out in your room.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.660
You might want to change
the blade in your razor.

19:55.430 --> 19:56.660
Thank you.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.200
Where were you
all night?

20:00.260 --> 20:03.930
I was in Never Ever Land.

20:20.400 --> 20:20.460
Um...

20:22.030 --> 20:24.530
do I want to know?

20:24.600 --> 20:27.600
I took away the staple gun,
but he found the superglue.
