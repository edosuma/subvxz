WEBVTT

00:12.429 --> 00:13.680
Your truck's smoking.

00:15.598 --> 00:16.641
So are you.

00:18.893 --> 00:21.771
I thought you quit.
You know that shit'll give you cancer.

00:22.897 --> 00:25.775
Yeah, well, I thought I had a job.

00:26.651 --> 00:29.654
I'm officially unemployed
as of the last day of school.

00:31.406 --> 00:32.615
You serious?

00:33.658 --> 00:34.867
-[sighs]
-I'm sorry, babe.

00:34.951 --> 00:38.705
And to top it off, the doughnuts
in the teachers' lounge were gluten-free.

00:38.788 --> 00:41.416
Fucking Mrs. Adams and her celiac disease.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.211
Well, them assholes don't deserve you.

00:44.919 --> 00:47.046
On the plus side,
they can't fire you twice,

00:47.130 --> 00:48.673
so start stealing shit.

00:48.756 --> 00:51.551
[chuckling] I'm already on it.

00:51.634 --> 00:55.138
Who wants to watch the health video
Your Body and You?

00:55.222 --> 00:58.141
[chuckling] Hell yeah, I love that thing.

00:58.225 --> 01:00.185
My favorite part's where
the kid looks down and he goes,

01:00.268 --> 01:02.062
[both] "Where did all the hair come from?"

01:02.145 --> 01:03.355
[chuckles]

01:04.231 --> 01:08.526
Hey, there's a school in Durango.
Might be looking for someone.

01:08.610 --> 01:11.571
I saw in the news the teacher got fired
for sleeping with a student.

01:11.654 --> 01:14.199
Thank God that wasn't illegal
when I was in school.

01:14.282 --> 01:17.285
Uh, it was.
You were just 18 in the tenth grade.

01:19.162 --> 01:22.082
[sighs] There's, like, 30 other teachers
in Garrison looking for a job.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.876
It's not fair. At least I teach something
people give a shit about!

01:24.959 --> 01:26.836
Unlike music or art.

01:28.796 --> 01:31.633
Yeah, you got oil leaking
all over the place.

01:31.716 --> 01:33.092
-[sighs]
-You need a new head gasket.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.803
Perfect. Just add it to the shit
I can't afford.

01:35.887 --> 01:38.806
Like paying rent,
buying health insurance, our wedding.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.392
Anonymously sending 20 bucks to the school

01:40.475 --> 01:43.186
'cause I feel so guilty
about stealing this DVD.

01:45.438 --> 01:48.650
-I can fix the truck.
-It's not about the truck, Colt.

01:48.733 --> 01:52.237
Yeah, but it's one thing
I can take off your plate.

01:52.904 --> 01:54.697
-Look, it's gonna be all right. Okay?
-[sighs]

01:54.781 --> 01:57.909
It's like the time I got cut
from the Portland Forest Dragons.

01:57.992 --> 02:00.453
Okay, Colt, no offense,
but it's not gonna make me feel better

02:00.537 --> 02:03.748
when you compare my job
to your failed fucking football career.

02:03.831 --> 02:04.832
[clicks tongue]

02:05.458 --> 02:06.501
Okay.

02:06.584 --> 02:10.713
Well, someone gets a free small Blizzard
every time he visits the DQ in that town,

02:10.797 --> 02:12.006
so I guess I failed.

02:13.883 --> 02:16.093
I'm just frustrated. I'm sorry.

02:16.178 --> 02:19.013
Yeah, don't worry. We'll fix this.

02:21.641 --> 02:22.934
And that.

02:25.978 --> 02:27.980
[theme song playing]

03:28.916 --> 03:31.168
Yeah, looks like she's got a caked udder.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.046
That's why her teats are so engorged.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.673
[chuckling]

03:35.757 --> 03:37.550
"Engorged teats."

03:37.634 --> 03:40.262
[chuckles sarcastically] Get out.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.432
Hey, I gotta talk to you
about something.

03:44.516 --> 03:45.933
Get out.

03:47.059 --> 03:48.395
Abby's losing her job.

03:50.146 --> 03:52.524
Turns out they're closing down Garrison,
not Norwood.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.318
How in the hell do you close a school?

03:55.402 --> 03:56.486
That's right.

03:56.569 --> 03:57.945
What's she gonna do?

03:58.530 --> 04:00.448
[sighs] We're figuring it out.

04:00.532 --> 04:03.410
I was thinking,
for her to save some money...

04:04.452 --> 04:06.996
how'd you feel about her
moving into the house?

04:07.664 --> 04:09.249
Whatever Abby wants.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.083
I mean, she's family. Almost.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.127
Assuming you don't fuck it up.

04:15.297 --> 04:16.381
Thank you.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.258
I promise it won't affect you at all.

04:18.341 --> 04:20.302
It'll be the same rules
as when I got that hamster.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.429
You don't have to feed her,
you don't have to clean up after her,

04:22.512 --> 04:24.764
and I'll be real careful
when I'm vacuumin' around her.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.475
-Hey, boys.
-[Beau] Hey.

04:27.559 --> 04:28.976
Oh, am I interrupting?

04:29.686 --> 04:31.854
Yeah, you are, and thank you so much.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.733
-Hey, Brenda.
-Hey, Colt.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.944
I could not wait to show you
my new purchase.

04:38.027 --> 04:41.281
Since you taught me how to shoot,
I wanted to get one of my own.

04:42.740 --> 04:44.241
It's pink.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.953
It's still a gun.

04:47.036 --> 04:49.539
-I know. I'm conflicted.
-[chuckles]

04:50.457 --> 04:51.624
I think it's cute.

04:51.708 --> 04:55.127
It's, like, what Barbie would use
if she was gonna murder Ken.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.004
-[chuckles]
-[chuckles] Oh!

04:57.088 --> 04:58.631
Guess who's Ken?

04:59.674 --> 05:01.175
[chuckles]

05:02.009 --> 05:06.598
Listen, I, uh... I also wanted to stop by
to ask you something.

05:06.681 --> 05:09.892
I gotta go to a wedding in Telluride
in a couple of weeks,

05:09.976 --> 05:12.395
and I know that you hate people,
and traveling,

05:12.479 --> 05:16.190
and, well, just about everything,
but would you like to join me?

05:16.899 --> 05:18.818
Uh, I'm not a big fan of weddings.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.446
There'll be bacon-wrapped steak.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.325
-Once again, I'm conflicted.
-[chuckles]

05:26.326 --> 05:29.203
All right, well,
why don't you just think about it?

05:30.538 --> 05:33.333
So, we still gonna go out for dinner
tomorrow night?

05:33.416 --> 05:36.002
Or we just gonna hunt it down ourselves?

05:36.878 --> 05:39.088
You know, I've never said this before...

05:39.964 --> 05:42.258
but I think you might like guns too much.

05:42.341 --> 05:43.635
-Hmm.
-[gun cocks]

05:45.052 --> 05:46.471
How about Charlie's?

05:46.554 --> 05:50.141
Oh, Beau, I don't think that Charlie
eats at Charlie's as much as you do.

05:50.933 --> 05:53.770
Actually, Charlie passed away last year.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.398
Had a beautiful service.

05:56.481 --> 05:58.400
They cremated him.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.526
Medium-rare.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.444
[gasps and chuckles]

06:01.528 --> 06:05.114
Well, we could go to the Cracker Barrel?
We can sit in Joanne's section.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.200
Yeah, I suppose we could do that.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.119
It's just that...

06:11.913 --> 06:15.041
Honestly, she's a really shitty waitress.

06:16.834 --> 06:19.378
-Why don't we just eat here?
-That'd be great.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.880
-All right.
-Thanks.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.383
And if you're looking
for something to shoot...

06:24.467 --> 06:27.429
Colt just bought a couple of gallons
of almond milk.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.558
Great, are they in the fridge?

06:31.641 --> 06:34.185
I'm not talking about
shooting the almond milk.

06:34.268 --> 06:35.520
Oh. [scoffs]

06:35.603 --> 06:36.979
Alright. See you...

06:42.109 --> 06:43.402
[microwave beeps]

06:50.201 --> 06:51.243
[clears throat]

06:53.287 --> 06:54.997
[grunting]

06:55.081 --> 06:56.458
Uh, man, that feels good.

06:56.541 --> 06:57.542
[knocking on door]

06:58.250 --> 06:59.669
Oh, it's like Florida for my balls.

07:05.883 --> 07:06.884
Oh.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.386
What's up, Engineer Jen?

07:09.471 --> 07:12.682
And yes, to answer your question,
I am alone.

07:13.390 --> 07:16.644
To answer your question, no way.
Not even if it cured cancer.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.981
So, I just came over to let you know

07:20.064 --> 07:21.941
we're gonna be doing
some surveying in the area.

07:22.024 --> 07:24.694
So, please don't shoot any of my workers.

07:24.777 --> 07:28.448
[chuckling] Why would you think
I would shoot one of your workers?

07:28.531 --> 07:31.743
There are literally signs all over that
say, "Trespassers will be shot on sight."

07:31.826 --> 07:34.454
Oh, yeah, those are my dad's.

07:34.537 --> 07:35.997
He's a little more bark than bite.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.501
[sighs] I've never actually
had to say this,

07:39.584 --> 07:42.670
but we're not going to build a pipeline
through your land

07:42.754 --> 07:46.215
if a worker is killed by you
or anyone in your family.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.594
Yeah. I suppose that makes sense.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.971
You know, you wanna play it safe,
why don't you tell your people

07:52.054 --> 07:54.849
if they gotta walk by the house,
kinda move in a zigzag.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.017
[Jen] Hmm.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.185
I appreciate it.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.605
Well, I'll let you get back
to whatever you were working on.

08:01.313 --> 08:03.941
I'm guessing a manifesto of some sort.

08:06.068 --> 08:09.989
Hey, uh... I know you like rocks.

08:10.072 --> 08:12.241
If you ever want 'em in a glass
with some whiskey on top,

08:12.324 --> 08:13.660
just swing by the bar I own.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.245
-You mean the bar your mom owns?
-[chuckles]

08:16.328 --> 08:18.164
It's just for tax purposes.

08:19.081 --> 08:21.458
You know,
we got a hot chick happy hour.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.419
It starts anytime you get there.

08:24.253 --> 08:25.672
I have a boyfriend.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.925
He's like you,
only he's smart, good-looking,

08:29.008 --> 08:31.177
and doesn't live in the woods
like a Keebler elf.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.429
[chuckling]

08:37.141 --> 08:38.976
-[Dale] Hey, Beau.
-[Beau] Hey.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.647
Good Lord,
I hope you bought her dinner first.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.318
Only thing older than that joke is you.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.698
[chuckles] Yeah,
you're a real spring chicken.

08:51.781 --> 08:55.034
You wanna tell me again
about Lincoln's inauguration?

08:55.117 --> 08:57.119
[chuckles softly] You check on that calf?

08:57.203 --> 09:00.998
Yeah, she'll be fine as long as
you put her together with her mama.

09:02.041 --> 09:06.629
You know, you got about two gallons
of almond milk blown to shit

09:06.713 --> 09:08.505
on your front driveway.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.011
Yeah, it was Colt's. Brenda shot it up.

09:14.637 --> 09:15.722
Made him cry.

09:16.806 --> 09:20.226
Oh, she's shooting up
your son's stuff now.

09:20.309 --> 09:21.728
Must be getting serious.

09:21.811 --> 09:27.441
Yeah, she asked me to go away with her
for a weekend to a wedding.

09:28.109 --> 09:31.738
Oh. [chuckling]
Boy, I love weddings.

09:32.780 --> 09:36.117
I went to one
one time, had a chocolate fountain...

09:36.743 --> 09:39.036
I just dipped my shrimp right in it.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.454
[chuckles]

09:40.537 --> 09:41.914
There's no rules.

09:44.291 --> 09:46.377
That's a delightful story, Dale.

09:47.419 --> 09:50.297
Thing is,
I had dinner with Joanne last week.

09:50.965 --> 09:54.051
And out of nowhere,
she tells me she's still interested in me.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.639
[whistles] Huh, two women?

09:58.430 --> 10:02.018
I knew I shouldn't have got you
that cologne sampler for Christmas.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.980
Uh, are you still interested in her?

10:06.063 --> 10:07.564
Well, I didn't think so.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.818
I can't deny I haven't thought about her.

10:11.819 --> 10:15.156
Hell, I even lied to Brenda when
she wanted to go to the Cracker Barrel.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.408
I don't lie to anyone.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.536
Except that hippie kid
in front of the Safeway,

10:20.620 --> 10:24.248
when he asked me if I got time
to talk about the fucking environment.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.918
[chuckling]

10:27.001 --> 10:30.922
You know, back when
I was first dating Charlene,

10:31.005 --> 10:37.094
I worked with a pretty young barrel racer
at the rodeo named, uh, Rhonda.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.514
We even made plans
to have dinner together.

10:40.597 --> 10:41.683
So what happened?

10:41.766 --> 10:44.143
Well, Charlene and I
had a picnic that day.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.690
First time I ever had an olive.

10:49.565 --> 10:52.526
-Dale...
-Well, I'm just trying to paint a picture.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.946
Fuck me, I guess.

10:56.572 --> 11:01.243
Anyhow, uh, Charlene and I had
so much fun at that picnic

11:01.327 --> 11:04.163
that I called and canceled
my date with Rhonda...

11:04.914 --> 11:08.167
and spent the weekend
with Charlene. [chuckles]

11:09.126 --> 11:13.255
[sighs] After a while,
I just forgot what Rhonda looked like.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.842
So, if you and Brenda are meant to be...

11:16.550 --> 11:20.722
then everything else will just...
fade away.

11:21.472 --> 11:22.849
Yeah, I guess.

11:24.391 --> 11:27.937
I think seeing Joanne
just stirred a bunch of stuff up.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.939
Brenda's a really terrific woman.

11:30.022 --> 11:35.236
Plus, you don't wanna piss her off,
now that you taught her how to shoot.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.279
[both chuckling]

11:41.909 --> 11:43.953
Hey, there she is.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.162
How was work?

11:45.246 --> 11:47.664
[chuckles] Fucking awesome.
Check this out.

11:50.292 --> 11:53.087
[chuckles] Why would you take
the three-hole punch?

11:53.796 --> 11:56.465
I don't know.
But stealing shit is the best!

11:56.548 --> 11:57.508
[both chuckle]

11:57.591 --> 11:59.218
I've never felt more alive.

12:01.595 --> 12:04.932
Hey, uh, I got a crazy idea
how we can save some money.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.517
You're finally gonna let me cut your hair?

12:08.019 --> 12:10.437
Nah, I said crazy,
not batshit fuckin' insane.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.440
[stammers] I talked to my dad

12:14.066 --> 12:16.402
and he said it's okay
if you move in the house.

12:16.485 --> 12:18.654
[laughs] What? What are you talking about?

12:18.737 --> 12:21.657
Hey, it's another problem solved.
Uh, truck fix, check.

12:21.740 --> 12:25.953
Rent, check.
Actually, rent, no check. [chuckling]

12:27.872 --> 12:31.000
Colt, I can't handle all the stress
of moving in on top of everything else.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.460
And if you would've talked to me about it,
I would have told you that.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.462
'Cause that's what adults do. They talk.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.925
Uh, well, apparently,
adults also yell at each other...

12:40.634 --> 12:41.803
when they're trying to help.

12:41.886 --> 12:46.140
I'm sorry I didn't talk to you,
but think about all the money we'd save.

12:46.223 --> 12:50.644
On utilities, and rent,
and cable, the NFL package.

12:53.314 --> 12:54.731
I don't have the NFL package--

12:54.816 --> 12:57.443
Well, now you have the NFL package!

12:58.194 --> 13:00.446
Abby, do you know
what the NFL package is?

13:00.529 --> 13:03.740
It's, like... It's the entire NFL...

13:04.867 --> 13:06.327
in a package.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.039
Yeah! I got it.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.583
You're goddamn right, you do!

13:14.168 --> 13:16.670
I mean... [stutters] think about
all the money we'd save.

13:16.753 --> 13:17.754
What we could use it on.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.799
Your bills, on the...
On the wedding, on a big TV.

13:20.883 --> 13:24.803
Or we do no wedding, and a bigger TV.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.516
Oh, but staying in your
childhood bedroom? [groans]

13:29.600 --> 13:30.935
It's just temporary.

13:31.018 --> 13:33.104
Eventually, my dad's gonna die.
We'll take his room.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.813
-[scoffs] Colt!
-[stammers]

13:34.897 --> 13:36.607
Oh, come... We'll change the bed.

13:38.860 --> 13:42.488
Come on, babe, I don't say this often,
but I think I'm making a lot of sense.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.701
Yeah, I suppose you are.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.747
So? You'll move in?

13:53.415 --> 13:55.792
-I guess.
-Fuck yeah! [chuckling]

13:57.628 --> 13:59.421
-Welcome home, baby.
-[chuckles]

14:02.633 --> 14:04.176
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Rooster sighs]

14:05.011 --> 14:07.889
[chuckles] Look who showed up.

14:08.890 --> 14:10.557
Another blonde.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.103
-The Nazis would love this town.
-[chuckling]

14:16.397 --> 14:19.150
So, what happened?
You finally come to your senses...

14:19.859 --> 14:21.277
and dump your boyfriend for me?

14:21.360 --> 14:24.613
Actually, he dumped me, asshole.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.409
Oh, shit. I am an asshole.

14:28.492 --> 14:29.576
[Jen] Hmm.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.663
Well, here you go.
This'll be on the house.

14:32.746 --> 14:34.916
-She just dumped me!
-Yeah, he dumped me!

14:37.793 --> 14:40.379
Well, look, I'll tell you,
I know how you feel.

14:40.462 --> 14:42.339
Actually just went
through a breakup myself.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.715
What ended it?

14:43.799 --> 14:47.178
Did you accidentally set her
on something sharp and she deflated?

14:47.261 --> 14:48.804
[Hank and Shirley laughing]

14:53.600 --> 14:55.269
Yeah, that's pretty funny.

14:55.352 --> 14:57.021
You know, we're having a special here.

14:57.104 --> 15:00.316
Drinks are free, but it's five bucks
every time you say something mean.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.902
Hmm. That's fair.

15:04.570 --> 15:05.612
Here's ten bucks.

15:06.822 --> 15:08.991
Has anyone ever told you...

15:09.075 --> 15:12.869
you look like the in vitro baby
of Richard Simmons and Art Garfunkel?

15:16.873 --> 15:19.710
[inhales sharply]
Well, two very successful men.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.671
So, what happened with your guy?

15:22.754 --> 15:26.800
[scoffs] I thought things were
going well with Jeff.

15:26.883 --> 15:31.097
Then he shows up, he tells me
he's found the love of his life.

15:31.180 --> 15:35.101
She's an ice girl
for the Colorado Avalanche.

15:35.184 --> 15:38.437
She's basically a shovel with cleavage.

15:39.730 --> 15:42.191
Oh, shit. An ice girl, huh?
You know, I got their calendar.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.692
You know what month she is?

15:43.775 --> 15:47.488
I got dumped for a redhead
with big, fake boobs

15:47.571 --> 15:50.407
and a tramp stamp that says,
"Go puck yourself."

15:51.825 --> 15:52.826
September.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.998
Look, for what it's worth,

15:57.081 --> 15:59.708
I've spent a couple a nights
with Miss September, and...

15:59.791 --> 16:01.585
[clicks tongue] you're way better looking.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.462
Aw.

16:03.545 --> 16:07.258
That's the sweetest, most disgusting thing
anyone has ever said to me.

16:07.341 --> 16:08.634
[chuckles]

16:08.717 --> 16:11.178
Hey, at least your ex dumped you
for a person.

16:11.262 --> 16:12.596
Mine dumped me for nobody.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.391
Yeah, I can see that.

16:17.226 --> 16:18.978
Yeah, that'll be five bucks.

16:20.312 --> 16:23.399
Shit, I only have a 20. Here.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.360
You're annoying, that beard sucks

16:26.443 --> 16:30.072
and you should really stop
shopping for shirts at the babyGap.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.583
So how was your day?

16:42.209 --> 16:43.544
[thunder rumbling]

16:43.627 --> 16:45.837
Well, that calf finally took to her mama.

16:45.921 --> 16:47.298
[mouthing] Oh, good.

16:47.381 --> 16:51.177
And Colt was so pissed about
his almond milk, he didn't talk to me.

16:51.260 --> 16:52.761
[both chuckle]

16:54.430 --> 16:56.598
It was the best day I've had for a while.

16:56.682 --> 16:57.891
[chuckles]

16:58.934 --> 16:59.976
[sighs]

17:00.561 --> 17:02.521
Hey, I've been thinking
about that wedding.

17:04.481 --> 17:06.817
If your offer still stands,
I'd like to join you.

17:07.943 --> 17:09.653
That makes me very happy.

17:11.905 --> 17:15.576
Uh, just so you know,
it's Hawaiian-themed.

17:15.659 --> 17:18.162
They want everyone to wear
a festive shirt.

17:18.995 --> 17:22.666
I've got a brand new white shirt
that got splattered with cow's blood.

17:24.210 --> 17:25.669
[vehicle approaching]

17:35.221 --> 17:37.681
-Colt, what the fuck?
-[thunder cracking]

17:37.764 --> 17:38.765
Shit.

17:39.516 --> 17:41.518
-You know what the rain does to my hair!
-[scoffs]

17:42.186 --> 17:43.187
Hey, guys.

17:44.020 --> 17:45.189
-Hi.
-[Beau] Hey.

17:45.272 --> 17:46.273
I'm Abby.

17:46.357 --> 17:48.984
That's right,
you two don't know each other.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.902
Brenda, this is Colt's fiancée.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.946
-Hi.
-It's really nice to meet you.

17:53.029 --> 17:54.823
Congratulations on the engagement.

17:54.906 --> 17:57.493
If you two aren't busy,
Colt's making me a welcome-home dinner.

17:57.576 --> 17:58.744
We'd love for you two to join us.

17:58.827 --> 18:00.662
[Colt] Spaghetti and footballs.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.873
It's like, uh, spaghetti and meatballs,

18:02.956 --> 18:07.169
except for the meatballs are shaped
like footballs.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.422
Thanks for clarifying.

18:11.840 --> 18:15.844
What Beau means to say is yes,
we would be delighted to join you.

18:15.927 --> 18:17.846
But only if I get to help.

18:17.929 --> 18:21.433
Hey, what's high in protein
and comes back from the dead?

18:24.395 --> 18:25.812
I know what you did.

18:27.564 --> 18:29.566
-Well, it was Beau's idea.
-[chuckles]

18:30.776 --> 18:31.985
[chuckles]

18:33.028 --> 18:34.446
She seems nice.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.782
-Yeah, she is.
-Hmm.

18:36.865 --> 18:38.409
Actually, I'm really happy.

18:39.075 --> 18:43.079
Although, don't tell anyone I said that.
I have a reputation to keep.

18:44.831 --> 18:46.583
Your secret is safe with me.

18:48.419 --> 18:52.047
I just want you to know that I appreciate
you letting me stay here, Mr. Bennett.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.259
Whatever you need
for as long as you need.

18:55.926 --> 19:00.055
But if you expect me to ask you
to call me Beau, you're wrong.

19:01.432 --> 19:03.767
I didn't even know
you had a first name till just now.

19:06.978 --> 19:09.481
I dropped the meat.
We're going to Wendy's.

19:15.612 --> 19:17.989
All right, you guys, time to say goodbye.

19:18.615 --> 19:21.493
What? You never said, "Last call."

19:23.745 --> 19:25.164
I know my rights.

19:26.998 --> 19:32.003
Come on, Hank. Let's go home,
smoke some dope and watch the bug zapper.

19:33.464 --> 19:36.842
-I do love to watch 'em burn.
-[both chuckle]

19:37.968 --> 19:39.678
Thanks for talking to me tonight.

19:40.346 --> 19:42.264
I didn't hate it
as much as I thought I would.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.184
Oh, shit. Déjà vu.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.394
First girl I ever had sex with
said the same thing.

19:47.478 --> 19:48.562
[chuckles]

19:49.355 --> 19:53.234
You know, you portray yourself
as this badass,

19:53.317 --> 19:56.945
-but you're really a nice guy.
-[chuckles]

19:57.028 --> 20:00.532
Damn right.
I'm like the Ryan Gosling of Garrison.

20:00.616 --> 20:01.908
[chuckles]

20:02.618 --> 20:03.744
What are you doing after this?

20:04.536 --> 20:06.455
Ah, you know, close up, head home.

20:06.538 --> 20:09.791
Sometimes I swing by the ranch and...
[chuckles] leave out some tools,

20:09.875 --> 20:11.960
so that Colt gets blamed for it
in the morning.

20:13.420 --> 20:15.797
Do you wanna get another drink somewhere?

20:15.881 --> 20:18.467
I mean, you know,
it's kinda the only bar in town.

20:18.550 --> 20:21.470
Although, my boy Shaggy's
got a fridge on his porch.

20:22.304 --> 20:23.972
We can swing by there and have a drink.

20:25.724 --> 20:28.352
He'll probably try and sell you
some fireworks if you're into that, but...

20:29.603 --> 20:34.065
Actually, I was thinking
there's a mini bar in my hotel room.

20:36.192 --> 20:37.486
Oh, shit.

20:39.363 --> 20:42.908
Uh, there's no tequila because I chugged
that when, uh, Jeff broke up with me.

20:42.991 --> 20:45.244
Also, no vodka or Toblerone.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.456
Okay, uh, just to be clear,

20:49.540 --> 20:53.960
you are saying you wanna get out of here,
go to your hotel and hook up, yeah?

20:54.044 --> 20:57.298
Well, I'm assuming you got better at it
since the first time.

20:59.591 --> 21:04.471
Oh, yeah. I mean, if sex was an
Olympic sport, I'd be, like, Usain Bolt.

21:06.598 --> 21:09.351
Because you'd be the fastest at it?

21:10.686 --> 21:13.814
No, 'cause I'd be the best at it.
I'd be slow.

21:15.316 --> 21:17.984
Or, you know, like, normal speed.

21:18.819 --> 21:21.154
Like, the best speed.
Look, I'm fucking great at sex, all right?

21:28.704 --> 21:31.247
Wait, uh, hold on a second.

21:31.332 --> 21:33.542
Oh, no. Did you just...

21:38.213 --> 21:40.757
What? No! No!
I gotta close up the fucking bar.

21:40.841 --> 21:41.842
Oh.

21:45.053 --> 21:48.098
-Hey, babe. I saved you some hot water.
-[sighs]

21:48.181 --> 21:50.392
I did my patented
"two-minute drill" shower.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.811
[chuckles] Just hit
the pits and the balls.

21:54.229 --> 21:56.315
Oh, hey, I got a surprise for you.

21:57.148 --> 21:59.443
[chuckles] Check this out.

22:01.236 --> 22:04.030
-Wait, is that my stuff?
-[chuckles] Yeah.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.783
I know you're stressed about moving in.
And I didn't want you to worry,

22:06.867 --> 22:09.035
so I stopped by your place
to pick up some stuff.

22:09.745 --> 22:13.206
So, this half is yours, this half is mine.

22:13.289 --> 22:15.667
Uh, can you win husband of the year
before you're even married?

22:15.751 --> 22:17.836
'Cause if you can, just... Shoo-in.

22:17.919 --> 22:19.045
[chuckles]

22:19.129 --> 22:22.173
Oh, hey, speaking of shoo-in,
check out the closet.

22:22.257 --> 22:24.426
-[snaps fingers]
-[both chuckle]

22:26.387 --> 22:29.264
That your shoes are in.

22:29.347 --> 22:33.810
[chuckling] Get it? "Shoe-in"?
'Cause the... There's shoes in the closet.

22:36.855 --> 22:39.983
Are you fucking kidding me?
Why would you do that?

22:40.066 --> 22:41.192
Uh, uh...

22:41.985 --> 22:45.238
I wanna say, ''Because I love you..."

22:46.031 --> 22:48.492
but I think I should say
"'Cause I'm stupid."

22:50.035 --> 22:52.120
Just stop trying to fix everything, okay?

22:52.203 --> 22:56.583
My truck, asking your dad to let me
move in here, movin' my shit. Just stop!

23:01.463 --> 23:03.632
Okay. Yeah.

23:04.425 --> 23:06.927
I will stop being a loving,
supporting person.

23:07.010 --> 23:08.804
You got it. That is not a problem.

23:09.763 --> 23:10.806
[sighs]

23:11.848 --> 23:12.933
I'm sorry.

23:13.684 --> 23:16.770
I didn't mean that. I just... I... [sighs]

23:17.979 --> 23:22.275
I feel like everything I say or do
right now is wrong.

23:22.358 --> 23:24.152
It's not. It's just...

23:27.072 --> 23:28.406
[sighs]

23:31.201 --> 23:33.495
You were in the shower
and I was... [chuckles]

23:34.204 --> 23:36.331
looking at that '99 all-district trophy.

23:37.207 --> 23:38.333
[chuckles]

23:40.043 --> 23:41.336
I remember when you got it.

23:41.419 --> 23:42.463
[chuckles]

23:42.546 --> 23:44.422
We were both right here...

23:45.215 --> 23:48.510
lyin' in your bed, talkin' about
what we wanted to do with our lives.

23:50.637 --> 23:52.931
You wanted to be a football player.
I wanted to teach.

23:56.602 --> 23:58.479
But neither one of us is doing that.

24:01.898 --> 24:02.941
[sighs]

24:03.024 --> 24:05.110
[voice breaking] How is it possible
that almost 20 years later,

24:05.193 --> 24:08.279
we're both in the exact same spot?

24:08.989 --> 24:10.323
Oh... [sighs]

24:10.406 --> 24:11.533
[sobs]

24:13.827 --> 24:15.245
It's just temporary.

24:17.498 --> 24:18.582
[sighs]

24:19.916 --> 24:21.710
I just feel so lost.

24:21.793 --> 24:23.044
[cries]

24:26.715 --> 24:28.717
Everything that I thought I was is gone.

24:29.510 --> 24:31.386
My job. My house.

24:32.137 --> 24:33.680
Even getting married.

24:34.973 --> 24:39.227
You know? I'm not gonna be Abby Phillips,
I'm gonna be Abby Phillips-Bennett.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.272
Don't get me wrong, I love you,

24:42.355 --> 24:45.358
and I want to get married, I do.
I just... [sniffles]

24:47.318 --> 24:49.279
I don't know who I am anymore.

24:51.865 --> 24:53.033
You...

24:55.536 --> 24:57.078
are the strongest...

24:58.413 --> 24:59.915
smartest...

25:00.999 --> 25:03.293
most loving person I know.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.756
You make everyone's life
who you come in contact with better.

25:09.257 --> 25:10.300
[sighs]

25:10.383 --> 25:13.720
Come on, you remember senior year?
We all wanted to TP the school...

25:13.804 --> 25:16.890
-[chuckles]
-You made us plant trees instead.

25:16.973 --> 25:19.726
Oh, wait. [stammers]
Well, of course we TP'd 'em later, but...

25:19.810 --> 25:21.645
[grunts and sniffles]

25:23.354 --> 25:24.522
You're gonna get through this.

25:26.650 --> 25:27.818
How do you know?

25:30.486 --> 25:31.988
'Cause it's you.

25:36.034 --> 25:38.453
-Listen, if it makes you feel better...
-Mmm?

25:38.536 --> 25:40.956
I'll change my last name. Colt Phillips.

25:41.039 --> 25:43.584
-[scoffs] You don't have to do that.
-[chuckles] Oh, thank God.

25:43.667 --> 25:45.501
'Cause I can't have
a last name starting with "F."

25:46.461 --> 25:47.879
I'm kidding!

25:48.922 --> 25:50.841
Thank you for being so sweet.

25:50.924 --> 25:52.092
[chuckles]

25:52.801 --> 25:53.802
[sniffles]

25:55.470 --> 25:57.472
-Bring it in.
-[both grunt]

25:59.265 --> 26:02.227
I liked it better when my life
was together and your life sucked.

26:02.310 --> 26:03.645
[chuckles]

26:03.729 --> 26:06.648
-Give it time, babe, give it time.
-[chuckles]

26:08.692 --> 26:10.736
All right. Two minutes doesn't cut it.
Hit the showers, Bennett.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.488
Whew. [chuckles]

26:13.571 --> 26:15.156
-No, you know what?
-[laughing]

26:18.451 --> 26:20.328
[indistinct chatter]

26:21.747 --> 26:23.456
Can I have that gherkin?

26:23.539 --> 26:24.625
No.

26:26.752 --> 26:30.672
Every time you eat one of those things,
I hear about your heartburn for a week.

26:31.464 --> 26:34.092
When did you become my wife?

26:36.261 --> 26:37.428
You know what?

26:38.513 --> 26:40.766
Here. Hope you choke on it.

26:43.434 --> 26:46.855
You know, if you started that sentence
with, "I should've married your brother,"

26:46.938 --> 26:49.065
I'd swear you was Charlene.

26:51.818 --> 26:55.947
I'm gonna do what Charlene should've done
years ago and leave you.

27:02.954 --> 27:03.872
Joanne?

27:06.207 --> 27:09.210
Oh, pardon me, ma'am,
I thought you were someone else.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.296
No problem.

27:17.468 --> 27:20.263
[grunts softly] You know,
you was right about that gherkin.

27:23.349 --> 27:26.561
Throw a roll of Tums on that tab,
would you?

27:40.701 --> 27:42.577
-Hey, Joanne.
-Hey, Beau!

27:42.660 --> 27:44.329
[chuckles] What are you doing here?

27:44.412 --> 27:47.040
You know, I thought I saw you
at the diner...

27:47.958 --> 27:49.125
but I didn't.

27:50.585 --> 27:51.586
Oh, okay.

27:52.378 --> 27:56.842
Well, if you're interested, I also wasn't
at the Safeway or the Jiffy Lube.

27:59.385 --> 28:02.180
I've been telling myself
I could get over you, but...

28:03.389 --> 28:04.975
Just thinking I saw you...

28:06.267 --> 28:07.811
all I wanted to do was...

28:09.020 --> 28:10.063
What?

28:17.695 --> 28:19.614
[country music playing]
