02:35.602 --> 02:37.160
Morning.

02:37.604 --> 02:39.367
Good morning.

02:40.540 --> 02:44.840
You know, you're the first guy
who's ever slept in this bed.

02:45.011 --> 02:46.911
No way.

02:48.748 --> 02:50.648
l'm glad you didn't spend the night
on the couch.

02:50.817 --> 02:54.617
Yeah, me too. After three nights,
it was getting a little lumpy.

02:56.656 --> 02:58.419
l'm gonna make some tea.

03:02.963 --> 03:05.363
You made some florist
very happy last night.

03:05.532 --> 03:07.329
l always like to have
a lot of flowers around.

03:07.701 --> 03:10.169
But l guess in honor of your visit,
l went a little overboard.

03:10.337 --> 03:12.134
Hey, l like your flowers.

03:12.305 --> 03:14.034
Thanks. Me too.

03:14.207 --> 03:16.266
l don't know,
they always make me feel good.

03:16.443 --> 03:17.705
When l was in the hospital,

03:17.878 --> 03:19.470
everybody else
hated the flowers they got,

03:19.646 --> 03:22.012
so l'd just pick them all up
and bring them into my room.

03:22.716 --> 03:25.344
l never sent you any flowers.

03:25.719 --> 03:28.313
ln fact,
l never really came to visit you.

03:28.488 --> 03:31.457
- You visited me.
- Once.

03:33.093 --> 03:37.530
Hey, don't feel guilty.

03:37.864 --> 03:39.331
l'm not mad at you.

03:39.499 --> 03:41.490
What l went through,
l had to go through on my own.

03:41.668 --> 03:43.363
So, what did you figure out in there?

03:44.771 --> 03:47.831
Well, l figured out that
the sooner l got serious about my life,

03:48.008 --> 03:49.839
the happier l'd be.

03:50.010 --> 03:55.073
So l traded in the recreational drugs
for a little Prozac,

03:55.248 --> 03:58.240
and got back together with my family
and went back to school,

03:58.418 --> 04:02.878
started studying and found out
what it was like to have a little success

04:03.056 --> 04:06.389
without feeling excluded or...

04:06.560 --> 04:08.118
Well, ashamed.

04:08.295 --> 04:09.956
Well, l'm proud of you, Em.

04:17.337 --> 04:18.531
Dim sum?

04:19.639 --> 04:20.663
Dim sum?

04:21.274 --> 04:22.400
You don't like dim sum?

04:24.010 --> 04:26.274
Well, l've never tried dim sum.

04:28.081 --> 04:30.641
l'm a megaburger kind of guy.

04:30.817 --> 04:33.285
One megaburger.

04:34.154 --> 04:35.178
Oh, you are so lucky.

04:35.355 --> 04:36.652
ln the real world of sororities,

04:36.823 --> 04:39.087
we're about to endure
the humiliation of hell week.

04:39.259 --> 04:41.124
- l can't say l'll be missing that.
- Me either.

04:41.294 --> 04:43.353
Well, we'll have to design
some special torture

04:43.530 --> 04:44.724
for the girls of the Peach Pit.

04:44.898 --> 04:48.356
How about we just declare hell week
juvenile and stupid and leave it at that?

04:48.535 --> 04:49.593
l second it.

04:49.769 --> 04:51.600
Oh, come on, you guys,
it is not that bad.

04:51.771 --> 04:54.740
They just make the pledges go three
days without makeup or something.

04:54.908 --> 04:55.932
Oh, that sounds so brutal.

04:57.277 --> 04:59.507
You guys, where's Kelly?
lsn't she coming?

04:59.679 --> 05:01.306
She said she might be busy.

05:02.649 --> 05:05.015
She's probably still a little steamed
from Thanksgiving.

05:05.185 --> 05:07.176
What happened?

05:07.354 --> 05:08.912
Dylan came to my house
instead of hers.

05:10.557 --> 05:13.355
- Well, she did ask him first.
- How was l supposed to know?

05:14.260 --> 05:15.955
Hey, guys. Sorry l'm late.

05:16.129 --> 05:19.792
Traffic on Wilshire was unbelievable.

05:20.266 --> 05:21.460
Kel, are you okay?

05:21.968 --> 05:23.401
Yeah.

05:23.570 --> 05:25.561
Brenda, what happened
at your house the other night

05:25.739 --> 05:26.763
was between me and Dylan.

05:26.940 --> 05:28.339
l know it wasn't your fault.

05:28.942 --> 05:31.240
l know. Have you talked to him?

05:31.911 --> 05:37.440
No, l really don't see the point.
l mean, it's just not working out.

05:37.617 --> 05:39.642
Why bother? So, what's up?

05:39.819 --> 05:42.014
Well, Brandon is still
in San Francisco with Emily.

05:42.188 --> 05:44.122
- l still can't believe that.
- Me either.

05:44.290 --> 05:46.224
Well, old hearts do die hard.

05:46.393 --> 05:48.224
Well, l don't have time
to worry about him,

05:48.395 --> 05:51.523
because l'm going
to my first college play rehearsal today.

05:51.698 --> 05:53.962
- lt's great you're doing that.
- When is it? Can we come?

05:54.134 --> 05:55.999
Yeah, you know,
it's just a workshop production,

05:56.169 --> 05:57.397
more like a stage reading.

05:57.570 --> 06:00.164
But you are more than welcome
to come, like Wednesday night.

06:00.340 --> 06:01.364
We'll be there.

06:01.541 --> 06:03.668
We wouldn't miss
your theatrical debut for the world.

06:03.843 --> 06:04.901
Well, l've got some news.

06:05.478 --> 06:06.945
- What?
- What?

06:08.081 --> 06:10.641
l did wind up at the Rubins'
for Thanksgiving.

06:10.817 --> 06:13.650
- See, it wasn't that bad, was it?
- lt was nice.

06:13.820 --> 06:15.310
- Do you know who was there?
- Who?

06:15.488 --> 06:17.649
Do you remember that bartender
at your parents' party?

06:18.258 --> 06:20.453
l do, he was cute. Jesse, right?

06:20.994 --> 06:22.518
Yeah. How did you know his name?

06:22.696 --> 06:24.721
Well, we were talking
and he introduced himself.

06:24.898 --> 06:25.922
He's a nice guy.

06:26.099 --> 06:28.863
Well, he was tending bar
at the Rubins'.

06:29.569 --> 06:30.627
Small world.

06:31.171 --> 06:33.230
So do we detect
something going on here?

06:34.708 --> 06:36.972
Well, he asked for my number.

06:37.143 --> 06:38.303
What about Dan?

06:40.180 --> 06:43.013
Well, l haven't had a lot of experience
with a lot of guys,

06:43.183 --> 06:48.678
so l don't know how to say goodbye
and break it off.

06:50.657 --> 06:53.148
Andrea, for somebody who claims
not to have a lot of experience,

06:53.326 --> 06:56.159
you sure are making up for lost time,
aren't you?

06:58.164 --> 07:00.598
Thirty-three, 34,

07:01.367 --> 07:06.066
- 35, 36, 37.
- Having fun yet, Sanders?

07:06.606 --> 07:08.403
l thought hazing was illegal
on this campus.

07:08.575 --> 07:10.099
Shut up, pledge.

07:10.276 --> 07:12.403
No one gave you permission
to speak.

07:12.846 --> 07:16.907
But for clarification purposes,
hazing in itself is not illegal.

07:17.083 --> 07:19.779
However,
cruel and unusual punishment is.

07:19.953 --> 07:22.979
But none of you think
this is cruel and unusual, do you?

07:23.156 --> 07:24.748
- No, sir.
- What?

07:24.924 --> 07:26.084
No, sir.

07:26.259 --> 07:27.851
On your feet, girls. Let's go, up.

07:28.027 --> 07:31.463
- Up.
- Up, up, up.

07:31.631 --> 07:32.859
Pass these down.

07:33.032 --> 07:37.093
ln these folders, you will find bios
of all of your pledge brothers.

07:37.270 --> 07:39.238
You will memorize them.

07:39.405 --> 07:41.498
When asked,
you will recite them on command.

07:41.674 --> 07:44.268
You will do whatever
a brother asks you to do.

07:44.444 --> 07:46.469
Whether it is
to pick up his laundry...

07:46.646 --> 07:49.615
- Or cutting his meat.
- Or shining his shoes.

07:49.783 --> 07:52.980
Furthermore, each pledge
will be assigned one special brother.

07:53.153 --> 07:56.281
Whose job it is to make your life
for the next week

07:56.456 --> 07:58.686
as pleasurable as it can possibly be.

08:00.326 --> 08:01.816
Welcome to hell week, boys.

08:04.030 --> 08:06.089
Hup, two, three, four.

08:06.266 --> 08:08.598
Hup, two, three, four.

08:08.768 --> 08:11.259
This is the most humiliating thing
l've ever had to do.

08:11.437 --> 08:14.133
Well, just pray
that we don't see anyone we know.

08:14.307 --> 08:17.606
l think it's a little too late for that.

08:20.780 --> 08:23.544
Well, Kelly, isn't that your boyfriend?

08:23.716 --> 08:26.708
Why don't you go over there
and kiss him hello?

08:26.886 --> 08:29.320
No, Leslie, l don't think
that that's a very good idea.

08:29.489 --> 08:31.957
- See, because we're not getting along.
- Oh, come on, Kelly.

08:32.125 --> 08:35.686
lt's just a little kiss.
Just an Alpha kiss, huh?

08:35.861 --> 08:38.227
Come on, Kel,
go over and get it over with.

08:38.398 --> 08:41.958
Donna, he's the last person
l wanna kiss right now.

08:42.302 --> 08:43.667
Well, look on the bright side.

08:43.837 --> 08:46.397
Could be John Sears
she asked you to kiss.

08:49.576 --> 08:51.066
Fine.

08:53.446 --> 08:55.073
Looking real good, Kel.

08:55.882 --> 08:58.407
Look, l know that you are probably
still mad at me

08:58.585 --> 09:00.849
and l am definitely still mad at you.

09:01.020 --> 09:04.717
But l have to kiss you right now
in front of all these people.

09:04.891 --> 09:08.292
And l would really appreciate it if
you would please just go along with it.

09:08.995 --> 09:10.019
Did you say please?

09:11.097 --> 09:13.065
Yeah, l said please.

09:13.233 --> 09:19.365
Well, in that case, l never could resist
a sorority girl in a shower cap.

09:23.109 --> 09:24.633
Yeah.

09:30.016 --> 09:31.449
What was that for?

09:31.618 --> 09:33.950
Cold cream. Turns me on.

09:36.823 --> 09:39.291
Hup, two, three, four.

09:39.459 --> 09:41.484
Hup, two, three, four.

09:45.698 --> 09:47.598
Hey, Andrea.

09:48.001 --> 09:49.468
Hi.

09:49.736 --> 09:53.103
Hi? That's all you have to say?
l've been calling you all weekend.

09:53.273 --> 09:55.002
Here, at your parents' house,
your grandma's.

09:55.174 --> 09:56.607
Have you been checking
your messages?

09:56.776 --> 09:59.574
l know, l'm sorry.
l've been really busy.

10:00.914 --> 10:03.974
- l'll see you, okay?
- Can l come in?

10:04.984 --> 10:07.009
Sure, come on in.

10:07.320 --> 10:08.878
Thanks.

10:12.959 --> 10:14.893
- Dan--
- What?

10:16.663 --> 10:18.187
l don't get it.

10:19.165 --> 10:20.962
Andrea, we spent
Thanksgiving dinner together.

10:21.134 --> 10:24.069
My parents loved you,
and l haven't heard from you since.

10:24.237 --> 10:25.670
Six messages.

10:25.838 --> 10:27.703
You might try listening to them
once in a while.

10:27.874 --> 10:29.808
- Dan.
- What?

10:31.044 --> 10:32.068
Nothing.

10:32.245 --> 10:33.837
Just listen,
l bet half these are from me.

10:34.013 --> 10:37.380
Hey, Andrea. This is Jesse Vasquez.
l told you l'd call.

10:37.550 --> 10:39.984
Listen, l'm playing softball
on Monday afternoon, wanna come?

10:40.153 --> 10:45.386
Give me a call, 2 1 3-555-57 7 1.
See you.

10:45.558 --> 10:47.048
Who the hell is Jesse Vasquez?

10:48.394 --> 10:49.918
- Dan.
- No, don't turn it off.

10:50.096 --> 10:52.496
- l wanna hear.
- Hi, it's Dan.

10:52.665 --> 10:54.155
l miss you, call me.

10:54.334 --> 10:57.667
Look, he's just this guy l met.
He's a friend.

10:57.837 --> 10:59.600
- Vasquez?
- Hi, this is Dan...

10:59.872 --> 11:02.102
What is this,
some equal opportunity program?

11:02.942 --> 11:04.500
What kind of racist remark is that?

11:04.677 --> 11:08.477
Don't accuse me of racism.
We're going out together.

11:08.648 --> 11:09.740
We're sleeping together.

11:09.916 --> 11:11.975
What are you doing
giving some other guy your number?

11:14.554 --> 11:15.851
Hi, this is Dan.

11:16.022 --> 11:19.253
- Call me, please.
- Dan...

11:20.159 --> 11:22.787
l don't know how to say this,
so l'm just gonna say it.

11:23.830 --> 11:25.593
l think you're great.

11:25.765 --> 11:30.532
But l'm not in love with you.

11:31.471 --> 11:32.995
- Just like that?
- No.

11:33.172 --> 11:35.606
l've thought about this a lot.

11:35.808 --> 11:37.366
l've analyzed it, l worried about it,

11:37.543 --> 11:40.706
l've tried to force myself to feel
something more.

11:40.880 --> 11:43.144
- Andrea, it's me. Where are you?
- But l can't.

11:45.018 --> 11:48.249
What about me?
What about how l feel?

11:49.622 --> 11:51.556
Believe me, l--

11:51.991 --> 11:53.390
Dan, l don't wanna hurt you.

11:54.193 --> 11:56.718
And you think breaking up with me
doesn't hurt me?

11:59.298 --> 12:00.959
l'm sorry.

12:03.536 --> 12:05.128
Me too.

12:08.274 --> 12:12.404
Hi, it's me again. Just wanted
to say l love you, wherever you are.

12:14.647 --> 12:16.046
This stuff is fantastic.

12:16.215 --> 12:20.481
Rice curd?
Okay, Brandon, the adventurer.

12:21.387 --> 12:27.519
You know, you make it sound
like l never take any risks, but l do.

12:28.795 --> 12:30.353
How is it?

12:32.031 --> 12:33.828
lt's terrible.

12:35.168 --> 12:38.035
Okay, so you're a regular
culinary explorer.

12:38.204 --> 12:40.104
What other daredevil feats
do you do?

12:40.273 --> 12:44.767
Well, take women, for example.

12:47.146 --> 12:48.238
Do l really wanna hear this?

12:50.149 --> 12:51.741
Okay, l really wanna hear this.

12:51.918 --> 12:55.012
Okay, first,
there was the Olympic ice skater.

12:55.188 --> 12:56.212
l was crazy about her.

12:56.389 --> 12:59.586
Unfortunately, she liked skating
a lot more than she liked me.

12:59.759 --> 13:01.659
Then there was the girl l met
at the beach club.

13:01.828 --> 13:05.229
l thought she was perfect
until she turned out to be a total bigot.

13:05.398 --> 13:07.127
And then...

13:07.300 --> 13:08.665
Well, then there was Nikki.

13:08.835 --> 13:09.859
Nikki was okay,

13:10.036 --> 13:12.470
except l got her on the rebound
from an abusive boyfriend.

13:13.739 --> 13:16.105
And then this summer,
l met a girl who was great.

13:16.976 --> 13:21.538
Unfortunately, she had been raped at
knifepoint and lived in New York City.

13:24.550 --> 13:27.110
Sounds like you've got
a real thing for wounded birds.

13:27.286 --> 13:28.378
Yeah.

13:28.554 --> 13:31.682
And last but not least,
there was the married woman.

13:33.593 --> 13:35.117
You were involved
with a married woman?

13:36.195 --> 13:38.720
Not just married.
Married to one of my professors.

13:40.199 --> 13:43.999
Sounds like Brandon Walsh is doing
a little playing with fire of his own.

13:45.771 --> 13:48.569
Actually,
that's the reason l came on this trip.

13:48.741 --> 13:50.732
l wanted to put a little distance
into the equation.

13:52.912 --> 13:55.210
l don't know,
maybe l'm the wounded bird.

13:55.381 --> 13:58.077
Out of all those women, l never told
any of them that l love them.

13:59.185 --> 14:00.209
lncluding me.

14:01.787 --> 14:03.516
lncluding you.

14:04.857 --> 14:07.121
So, what do you make of that,
Dr. Valentine?

14:07.293 --> 14:08.760
What do you make of it?

14:08.928 --> 14:10.418
Answering a question
with a question.

14:10.596 --> 14:12.723
We have been through
a lot of therapy, haven't we?

14:12.899 --> 14:16.391
l've been pre-washed,
shrunk and hung out to dry.

14:16.569 --> 14:20.232
- So, what do you make of it?
- l don't know.

14:20.406 --> 14:22.397
Maybe l've just
never been in love before.

14:22.909 --> 14:25.503
- Or maybe you're afraid of love.
- Maybe.

14:27.446 --> 14:30.847
Or incapable of love.

14:31.817 --> 14:33.512
l hope not.

14:34.820 --> 14:36.754
Because l love you, Brandon.

14:41.194 --> 14:42.991
l love you too.

14:53.773 --> 14:54.831
Thank you for coming

14:55.374 --> 15:01.210
to this, the first rehearsal of my newest
play, The Mask of Melancholy.

15:01.647 --> 15:07.142
You see, l realized
that l can't explore the notion of masks

15:07.320 --> 15:11.620
without removing
the one true mask we all wear.

15:12.124 --> 15:14.820
Brenda,
your part is the key to the play.

15:15.361 --> 15:18.091
lf you'll turn to page seven,
the big speech.

15:21.834 --> 15:25.361
l'm tired of the lies,
tired of the deception,

15:25.771 --> 15:28.638
tired of the denial
that defines my daily existence.

15:28.808 --> 15:30.002
But what is truth?

15:31.143 --> 15:32.576
l'm not sure.

15:32.745 --> 15:35.339
All l know
is that l must look into my soul,

15:35.514 --> 15:39.974
into the depths of my despair,
into the miasma of my melancholy.

15:40.152 --> 15:43.019
Good. Keep going.

15:43.689 --> 15:44.747
Go on, Brenda.

15:46.392 --> 15:48.917
- Wait, what is this?
- What?

15:49.195 --> 15:50.219
Keep reading.

15:52.498 --> 15:55.194
But how can l strip off the mask,
remove the paint,

15:56.002 --> 15:59.438
cast off the armor that prevents me
from finding my true identity

15:59.605 --> 16:01.800
without taking off the shield
that protects us all?

16:02.208 --> 16:05.006
And that's where
you take off your clothes.

16:06.879 --> 16:10.645
Yeah, l can read,
but l'm not taking my clothes off.

16:10.816 --> 16:14.582
No. Brenda, just think of the impact.

16:17.123 --> 16:18.420
Can l talk to you for a minute?

16:23.296 --> 16:27.255
Listen, l gave you this part
because you truly have the potential

16:27.433 --> 16:30.334
to become a wonderful,
wonderful actress.

16:30.503 --> 16:33.495
But you can't let your inhibitions
hold you back.

16:34.006 --> 16:37.032
This isn't about
taking off your clothes.

16:37.576 --> 16:43.913
The moment is about baring
the soul of mankind, of womankind.

16:45.084 --> 16:47.109
Art is truth, Brenda.

16:47.286 --> 16:51.746
And only in truth
can we truly explore our art.

16:54.493 --> 16:55.755
You're right.

16:56.662 --> 16:58.095
So you with me on this?

16:59.865 --> 17:01.457
Yeah, l am.

17:01.634 --> 17:02.658
Okay.

17:06.472 --> 17:08.234
Left, right, left.

17:08.406 --> 17:12.343
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.

17:12.511 --> 17:15.638
Hup, two, three, four.
Hup, two, three, four.

17:15.815 --> 17:18.682
Looks like we're not
the only ones marching through hell.

17:21.987 --> 17:24.421
Wipe that smile
off your face, pledge.

17:24.589 --> 17:26.421
ls something funny?

17:30.596 --> 17:32.461
Why don't you drop
and give me 20?

17:32.631 --> 17:34.098
Yes, sir.

17:36.936 --> 17:39.268
One, two, three.

17:39.438 --> 17:41.633
Recite the alphabet, Sanders.

17:41.807 --> 17:45.140
A, B, C.

17:45.311 --> 17:46.903
- Sing it.
- D.

17:47.079 --> 17:50.207
E, F, G, H, l, J,

17:50.383 --> 17:51.475
l can't hear you, Sanders.

17:51.650 --> 17:53.914
K, L, M, N, O, P,

17:54.086 --> 17:57.886
Q, R, S, T, U, V,

17:58.057 --> 18:02.551
W, X, Y and Z

18:02.728 --> 18:07.062
Now l know my ABCs

18:07.233 --> 18:12.398
Next time won't you sing with me?

18:12.571 --> 18:14.471
Sir.

18:14.640 --> 18:16.505
Excellent.

18:16.909 --> 18:18.740
Fun's just starting.

18:19.578 --> 18:23.173
Okay, pledges, about face.

18:23.682 --> 18:25.149
March.

18:25.317 --> 18:26.716
Time for lunch.

18:26.886 --> 18:29.047
Oh, sorry, that was yesterday.

18:29.221 --> 18:31.246
No lunch today.

18:34.560 --> 18:35.857
Guys, l need your help.

18:36.028 --> 18:37.586
What?

18:37.763 --> 18:40.527
Do either of you
have a dress that will fit me?

18:45.738 --> 18:48.172
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

18:50.643 --> 18:53.874
Don't say anything.

18:55.347 --> 18:57.315
You look beautiful.

18:57.483 --> 19:00.646
Yeah, but first you need lipstick.

19:00.820 --> 19:02.788
- Lipstick?
- Lipstick.

19:02.955 --> 19:05.116
lt'll bring out your cheekbones.
Donna.

19:05.291 --> 19:06.918
Forget it. No.

19:07.092 --> 19:08.184
Come on, you have no choice.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.521
You have to go through with this
or quit the fraternity.

19:10.696 --> 19:13.028
l'm not quitting the fraternity.
That would mean Sears wins.

19:13.199 --> 19:14.791
What does this have to do
with John Sears?

19:14.967 --> 19:17.401
Did you see him today?
The guy's got it in for me.

19:17.570 --> 19:19.800
You mean what happened
with the girl at the Downey House?

19:19.972 --> 19:22.770
Yeah, that, and he also knows
that l told Kelly what a jerk he is.

19:22.942 --> 19:25.934
You didn't have to tell me.
Fortunately, l figured it out myself.

19:26.111 --> 19:27.840
l am not getting kicked out
of the KEG House,

19:28.013 --> 19:30.311
and l'm certainly not gonna
let Sears blackball me.

19:30.483 --> 19:32.951
And there is no way l'm gonna
let that weasel see me squirm.

19:33.118 --> 19:34.278
Good for you.

19:35.855 --> 19:38.790
Now, how do l look?

19:39.625 --> 19:40.649
What a babe.

19:41.126 --> 19:42.252
Thanks, Don.

19:42.428 --> 19:43.690
Kelly, take the picture.

19:43.863 --> 19:45.990
- Okay.
- Let me work it. Let me work it out.

19:46.165 --> 19:47.598
Wait. Okay.

19:47.766 --> 19:48.824
- Ready?
- Hold on, hold on.

19:49.001 --> 19:50.935
Very nice.

20:39.318 --> 20:42.219
- So that's Alcatraz, huh?
- The Rock.

20:42.388 --> 20:43.980
You know,
nobody ever escaped from there.

20:44.156 --> 20:46.386
Really? l wonder why.

20:46.559 --> 20:48.550
Come here,
l wanna show you something.

20:55.167 --> 20:56.930
What are all those seals doing here?

20:57.102 --> 20:58.626
They're not seals. They're sea lions.

20:58.804 --> 20:59.828
Whatever.

21:00.005 --> 21:01.666
Couldn't they find
a better place to hang out?

21:01.840 --> 21:04.240
l mean,
this isn't exactly their natural habitat.

21:04.410 --> 21:06.537
They used to live on a rock
at the entrance to the bay,

21:06.712 --> 21:10.546
but after the earthquake in '89,
they migrated down here.

21:10.716 --> 21:13.150
For a time, people tried to figure out
some way to move them.

21:13.319 --> 21:15.014
You know, save them?

21:15.754 --> 21:16.982
But they didn't wanna be saved.

21:17.690 --> 21:19.419
They like it here.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.021
So do l.

21:33.839 --> 21:39.038
So now, l guess the only question is,
am l gonna transfer to Berkeley

21:39.211 --> 21:42.442
or are you gonna come
and sign up at CU?

21:43.115 --> 21:44.742
You'd actually move up here
for me?

21:45.918 --> 21:48.250
Yeah. l would.

21:58.330 --> 21:59.957
Well,
it's not exactly my favorite color,

22:00.132 --> 22:02.896
but l do think the style
is quite flattering.

22:03.068 --> 22:04.763
Excellent.

22:04.937 --> 22:07.599
Tomorrow, you will wear this charming
ensemble in the student union

22:07.773 --> 22:11.971
as you pass out 50 photocopies of this
to any and all interested parties.

22:12.144 --> 22:14.169
- Come on, don't make me do that.
- That's not all.

22:14.346 --> 22:16.109
You've heard
about the pledge scavenger hunt?

22:16.281 --> 22:17.305
Yeah.

22:17.483 --> 22:19.951
Well, you have
a particularly juicy assignment.

22:20.119 --> 22:22.849
Your mission, Mr. Sanders,
should you choose to accept it...

22:23.355 --> 22:24.481
Do l have a choice?

22:24.657 --> 22:26.750
- No.
- l didn't think so.

22:26.925 --> 22:30.053
Professor Randall,
your sociology teacher.

22:30.229 --> 22:31.821
- Yeah?
- He's a sports fanatic.

22:31.997 --> 22:34.192
And in his office
is his prized possession,

22:34.366 --> 22:36.766
a signed Jackie Robinson baseball.

22:36.935 --> 22:38.732
Your mission is to retrieve it.

22:38.904 --> 22:40.599
Come on, Keith,
he's not gonna give me that.

22:40.773 --> 22:43.799
Steve, Steve, Steve.

22:47.312 --> 22:50.509
- No way. Forget it.
- Excuse me?

22:50.683 --> 22:53.208
- l can't do that.
- You know the rules.

22:53.385 --> 22:55.182
Keith, l almost got thrown out
of high school

22:55.354 --> 22:57.083
for pulling a stunt similar to that.

22:57.256 --> 22:58.655
You don't think we know that?

22:59.224 --> 23:01.351
That's why the brothers thought
you'd be perfect.

23:03.996 --> 23:05.725
How's it going, Keith?

23:07.232 --> 23:09.359
How are we doing, pledge?

23:11.737 --> 23:13.364
l'm doing fine.

23:23.248 --> 23:24.272
Do you know them?

23:24.450 --> 23:26.577
No, l don't know every Latino in L.A.

23:27.519 --> 23:29.646
Andrea, tell me something.

23:29.822 --> 23:32.916
What's a girl like you doing
going out with a guy like me?

23:35.728 --> 23:38.492
Why would you ask me
something like that?

23:38.731 --> 23:41.165
Just wondering why a nice Jewish girl
from Beverly Hills

23:41.333 --> 23:42.732
would wanna go out
with a homeboy.

23:43.802 --> 23:46.669
First of all, l grew up
in Van Nuys, not Beverly Hills.

23:48.273 --> 23:52.107
Secondly, l have gone out
with white guys, black guys...

23:52.277 --> 23:54.404
l even dated a Republican once.

23:55.347 --> 23:57.872
So l guess l can go out with you.

23:58.050 --> 23:59.347
l just wanted to hear you say it.

24:01.687 --> 24:03.678
Was that supposed to be a test?

24:03.856 --> 24:07.451
Well...

24:08.761 --> 24:12.026
These are my buddies.
Classmates mostly.

24:12.931 --> 24:14.228
You go to UCLA?

24:14.800 --> 24:17.598
Yeah, guilty as charged.
Second year law school.

24:17.770 --> 24:18.930
You could have told me.

24:19.104 --> 24:22.562
l wanted to find out whether you'd go
out with Jesse Vasquez the bartender

24:22.741 --> 24:24.606
and not Jesse Vasquez
the law student.

24:25.244 --> 24:27.371
- So it was a test?
- Oh, no.

24:27.946 --> 24:30.779
The real test comes whether or not
you can turn the double play.

24:33.418 --> 24:34.908
Andrea, this is my buddy
Cunningham.

24:35.087 --> 24:36.987
- We were at Yale together.
- Hey.

24:37.689 --> 24:40.089
- You went to Yale?
- Yeah, why?

24:41.894 --> 24:43.589
Long story.

24:47.633 --> 24:48.861
You get enough junk there?

24:49.034 --> 24:50.626
What,
you think l went a little overboard?

24:50.803 --> 24:56.036
No, l think that you are the most
generous guy l have ever met.

24:56.208 --> 24:59.234
Do you know how long
l've wanted one of these things?

25:02.281 --> 25:03.441
No, but now you've got one.

25:03.615 --> 25:05.515
You can stick it on your dresser
and think of me.

25:05.684 --> 25:06.776
But l don't have to do that.

25:06.952 --> 25:09.011
Because l found you
and you found me,

25:09.188 --> 25:11.213
and that's what's important.

25:12.157 --> 25:15.183
lt's me, open up.
l know you're in there.

25:15.360 --> 25:16.452
Great timing.

25:16.628 --> 25:18.755
- She's got a good knack, doesn't she?
- Yes, she does.

25:19.832 --> 25:21.356
Come on in, Rosie.

25:22.234 --> 25:24.759
- Hello.
- Hello.

25:25.838 --> 25:29.706
Rosie, why don't you entertain
Brandon while l take a bath?

25:29.875 --> 25:32.605
And don't say anything
about anything, okay?

25:34.246 --> 25:36.237
Brandon, Brandon, Brandon.

25:36.415 --> 25:39.111
Rosie, Rosie, Rosie.

25:39.284 --> 25:41.548
- Great city, isn't it?
- The best.

25:41.720 --> 25:45.121
So l must seem like a nosy
next-door neighbor to you, huh?

25:45.290 --> 25:48.657
- No, Rosie, l think you're great.
- Oh, no, l'm nosy.

25:48.827 --> 25:51.796
- Why don't you sit down?
- Thanks.

25:53.899 --> 25:58.336
And l must tell you,
it is my responsibility,

25:58.503 --> 26:02.405
as the truly nosy next-door neighbor,
to tell you that l'm not gonna let Emily

26:02.574 --> 26:06.806
throw her life away,
even if you are a semi-perfect guy.

26:06.979 --> 26:09.209
Well, thanks, Rosie,
but what are you talking about?

26:11.149 --> 26:12.616
She didn't want me to tell you this,

26:12.784 --> 26:15.878
but it doesn't look
like she's going to, so...

26:16.054 --> 26:20.286
Brandon, Emily was accepted to study
at the Cousteau lnstitute in France.

26:20.459 --> 26:24.088
lt's one of the major centers
of marine biology in the world.

26:24.263 --> 26:28.495
Very few undergraduates are picked,
and even fewer Americans.

26:28.667 --> 26:30.362
lt's her dream come true.

26:30.535 --> 26:31.661
Did you say France?

26:32.170 --> 26:33.831
She's supposed to leave
in three days.

26:35.107 --> 26:36.369
Why didn't she tell me this?

26:37.442 --> 26:42.345
Hello, why do you think?
She's in love with you.

27:17.582 --> 27:19.311
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:19.484 --> 27:20.542
l didn't feel you get up.

27:21.019 --> 27:23.317
l tried not to wake you.

27:24.790 --> 27:27.623
l wanna wake up next to you every day
for the rest of my life.

27:28.627 --> 27:30.492
There's time for that.

27:31.096 --> 27:33.826
What's this?
You're getting sick of me already?

27:33.999 --> 27:37.230
- No, not at all.
- Good.

27:40.005 --> 27:42.974
l know you're in there. Wake up.

27:43.141 --> 27:44.733
We're up, we're up.

27:45.210 --> 27:48.441
- l'll get it. You get dressed.
- Thanks.

27:54.553 --> 27:57.351
- Breakfast's here.
- Thanks.

27:57.522 --> 27:59.649
So l don't see any suitcases.

27:59.825 --> 28:01.656
- Did you talk to her yet?
- No.

28:01.827 --> 28:04.819
Brandon, if you don't say something,
she's not gonna get on that plane.

28:04.997 --> 28:07.192
ls that what you want?
Don't answer that.

28:07.366 --> 28:10.733
- Look, l just don't wanna spoil this yet.
- Well, you better hurry up.

28:10.902 --> 28:12.597
You're as bad as she is.

28:12.771 --> 28:15.069
- Do you love her?
- Yes.

28:15.240 --> 28:18.004
Well, then, why are you doing this?
You can't let her give this up.

28:18.176 --> 28:20.144
- l'm not doing anything.
- Exactly.

28:20.312 --> 28:23.145
She's worked too hard.
She's been through too much.

28:23.315 --> 28:27.115
lf you love her, if you really love her,
you'll make her go.

28:34.493 --> 28:35.721
l gotta tell you, Steve.

28:35.894 --> 28:37.862
You, buddy,
have got some legs on you.

28:38.030 --> 28:39.292
Way up there, l see them.

28:39.464 --> 28:41.432
Oh, you really
should have shaved though.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.227
Guys, enough, okay?

28:43.402 --> 28:44.892
You do make the perfect KEG girl.

28:46.838 --> 28:49.204
Guys, this is embarrassing enough
without you here,

28:49.374 --> 28:50.432
so could you just bail?

28:50.609 --> 28:52.201
l think he looks sexy.

28:52.377 --> 28:54.971
Well, he is wearing my lipstick.
And l think it looks great.

28:55.147 --> 28:56.171
Enough already.

28:56.348 --> 28:58.077
Now l know
why l didn't join a fraternity.

28:58.250 --> 28:59.274
Yeah, l know.

28:59.451 --> 29:03.080
lt must be a drag, that frat life,
huh, Steve? A drag?

29:03.655 --> 29:05.555
Yeah, l get it. Beat it.

29:09.728 --> 29:11.855
Hey, man, bathroom material.

29:13.765 --> 29:17.997
Stevie, you look ravishing.

29:19.171 --> 29:20.832
Come on, show us a little leg, baby.

29:21.006 --> 29:23.099
Come on, lift it up. See that knee.

29:23.275 --> 29:24.902
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:25.077 --> 29:26.874
- Oh, nice.
- l'm getting turned on here.

29:27.045 --> 29:29.309
Well, that's what l'm here for, John.

29:29.481 --> 29:31.745
Such a good job too.

29:32.651 --> 29:35.677
Oh, man,
that Steve's a good guy, man.

29:35.854 --> 29:38.322
- He's a wimp.
- Give him some credit, John.

29:38.490 --> 29:40.151
He's done everything
we've asked him to do.

29:40.325 --> 29:43.021
Yeah, well, you know
what the real test is gonna be?

29:43.395 --> 29:45.192
There's no way
he's gonna steal that baseball.

29:45.363 --> 29:47.854
- He doesn't have the guts.
- l don't know, man.

29:48.033 --> 29:50.092
l wouldn't put it past him.

30:08.453 --> 30:11.854
Hey, l was just
checking out your library.

30:12.023 --> 30:14.457
lt's no wonder you know
so much about the seals.

30:14.626 --> 30:16.059
Sea lions.

30:16.228 --> 30:18.128
Yeah,
l've been into that stuff for a long time.

30:18.663 --> 30:20.324
Seems to me
it's more like your passion.

30:20.499 --> 30:21.898
No, you are.

30:25.737 --> 30:30.071
Listen, Em,
l know about the Cousteau lnstitute.

30:30.642 --> 30:32.507
Rosie told me.

30:33.578 --> 30:35.842
- l'm gonna kill her.
- No, you aren't.

30:36.014 --> 30:38.380
She's just being a good friend.

30:39.384 --> 30:43.286
You've gotta go for this, Emily.
This is the opportunity of a lifetime.

30:44.756 --> 30:47.281
- Well, it's not your decision to make.
- l know.

30:48.059 --> 30:49.720
But maybe it's time you face reality.

30:49.895 --> 30:51.954
Don't try and make up my mind
for me.

30:52.130 --> 30:53.620
You want reality?

30:53.798 --> 30:55.959
Maybe l'm not ready to move
halfway across the world.

30:56.134 --> 30:59.570
- Maybe l'm not up to this yet.
- What, are you kidding?

30:59.738 --> 31:02.605
Of course you're ready for this.
You're ready for anything.

31:05.410 --> 31:08.709
- Brandon, l can't.
- Why not?

31:12.784 --> 31:14.843
Because l love you.

31:15.720 --> 31:17.779
l don't know
if l could take losing you again.

31:20.425 --> 31:22.325
You mean you'd give
this whole thing up for me?

31:22.494 --> 31:25.292
Not for you, for me.

31:27.699 --> 31:29.690
Well, and you.

31:34.606 --> 31:36.039
Don't worry.

31:36.741 --> 31:38.140
We'll work something out.

31:45.116 --> 31:46.606
- Hey, Bren.
- Hey.

31:46.785 --> 31:48.446
- ls that your new play?
- Yeah.

31:48.620 --> 31:50.781
What time does it start tonight?

31:50.956 --> 31:53.754
Well, l mean, it's not really a play.
lt's more like a work in progress.

31:53.925 --> 31:56.689
- You don't have to come.
- Brenda, l would not miss your debut.

31:58.063 --> 31:59.758
Kelly, maybe you ought to pass
on this one.

32:00.098 --> 32:01.122
Why? What's the matter?

32:02.634 --> 32:04.261
Here.

32:05.704 --> 32:07.137
Read this.

32:13.511 --> 32:15.069
You have to take off your clothes?

32:16.047 --> 32:17.981
Well, Van Gogh cut off his ear
for art, right?

32:18.149 --> 32:20.549
lf l'm an artist,
then l have to take chances.

32:21.987 --> 32:23.750
But your clothes,
you taking them off?

32:24.422 --> 32:27.653
lt's not as if l'm breaking
the law or something. l don't think.

32:28.226 --> 32:30.820
Anyway, it's experimental theater.
lt's just an experiment.

32:31.096 --> 32:32.620
What about your parents?
Do they know?

32:32.797 --> 32:34.856
Are you kidding?
lt's just a workshop program.

32:35.033 --> 32:36.898
l think that they can live without it,
you know?

32:37.068 --> 32:40.094
So, you guys, l saw these posters
all over the English building.

32:40.272 --> 32:42.536
The Mask of Melancholy
doth open this eve.

32:42.974 --> 32:44.498
- You saw posters?
- Yeah.

32:44.676 --> 32:47.042
Nothing fancy,
but they're all over the kiosk.

32:47.212 --> 32:48.474
Oh, my God.

32:48.647 --> 32:49.739
What is it, Bren?

32:49.914 --> 32:51.848
Nothing.
Just a little stage fright, l guess.

32:52.017 --> 32:53.450
Come on, l'll be there.

32:55.420 --> 32:56.887
Dylan,
you don't really have to come.

32:57.055 --> 32:59.523
l mean, don't give up
any studying for it or anything.

32:59.691 --> 33:00.749
l'm pretty lousy.

33:00.925 --> 33:05.487
Bren, there are no bad actors,
only bad plays.

33:07.299 --> 33:08.323
Break a leg.

33:11.469 --> 33:14.029
Look out there.
You can see the tide shift.

33:14.205 --> 33:16.366
You know,
where the bay becomes the ocean.

33:16.541 --> 33:19.999
lt comes in all day
and goes out all night.

33:20.178 --> 33:22.442
lt can't make up its mind.

33:22.614 --> 33:24.343
Like me.

33:24.849 --> 33:26.646
What do you think l should do?

33:26.818 --> 33:28.217
lt's not my decision to make, Em.

33:28.386 --> 33:31.321
Well, what if l go to France
and it's as awful as that rice curd?

33:31.489 --> 33:33.354
Then you'll come home.

33:34.659 --> 33:36.650
But what if l love it?

33:37.829 --> 33:41.060
Then you'll be happy.
What's wrong with that?

33:43.935 --> 33:45.732
l can't go backwards.

33:45.904 --> 33:48.532
l'll end up right back
where l started.

33:49.374 --> 33:52.104
l didn't like myself very much then.

33:55.013 --> 33:59.848
Listen, Em, you're the one who said
you gotta take risks.

34:00.018 --> 34:02.885
lf you don't do this,
you're gonna regret it.

34:03.054 --> 34:09.219
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow,
but soon, and for the rest of your life.

34:15.867 --> 34:17.458
l love you.

34:18.770 --> 34:20.601
l love you too.

34:21.505 --> 34:23.804
Come on,
got a lot of packing to do.

34:34.619 --> 34:37.018
You know, of all the girls
that Brandon's brought in here,

34:37.188 --> 34:40.157
he was pretty stuck
on that Emily Valentine.

34:40.324 --> 34:41.518
Do you think he's coming back?

34:41.693 --> 34:42.887
l hope so.

34:43.061 --> 34:44.085
He'll be back.

34:44.262 --> 34:47.561
He'd better be back, l already paid
for his tuition next semester.

34:48.099 --> 34:49.726
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, you.

34:49.900 --> 34:50.925
Hey there.

34:51.101 --> 34:52.626
Whatever happened
to a home-cooked meal?

34:52.804 --> 34:56.364
Well, with Brandon out of town
and Brenda rehearsing all the time,

34:56.541 --> 34:58.099
l figured l'd give myself a night off.

34:58.810 --> 35:00.300
So you guys
going to the play tonight?

35:00.979 --> 35:03.539
- lt's tonight?
- Yeah, she didn't tell you?

35:07.786 --> 35:10.949
So, what kind of play is this?
Comedy, drama, musical?

35:11.122 --> 35:13.647
Well, Brenda says it's experimental.

35:13.825 --> 35:15.690
So, what does that make us?
Guinea pigs?

35:15.860 --> 35:18.727
- l'm sure it's very, very provocative.
- Yes.

35:18.897 --> 35:20.694
Or very boring.

35:20.865 --> 35:23.425
- Hi, guys.
- Dylan.

35:23.601 --> 35:26.536
- What's wrong?
- Just go. Nothing yet.

35:26.704 --> 35:27.864
Anybody seen Bren?

35:30.108 --> 35:31.234
So how's the house?

35:31.409 --> 35:33.274
l don't know.
l was just about to check.

35:34.979 --> 35:36.606
lsn't this exciting?

35:36.781 --> 35:39.215
Oh, my God, my parents are here.

35:39.384 --> 35:42.751
So? They've seen you naked before.

35:53.631 --> 35:56.691
Rosie will take care of shipping a few
things, you know, my books and stuff.

35:56.868 --> 35:58.301
Go or stay?

35:58.470 --> 36:02.804
Curlers l haven't used in five years.
l'd better take them.

36:03.107 --> 36:05.200
You know, Emily,
you're taking everything you own.

36:05.376 --> 36:07.571
They do have stores in France,
you know.

36:07.745 --> 36:09.042
- T-shirts?
- All of them.

36:10.448 --> 36:13.246
Oh, look, it's my favorite shirt.

36:13.418 --> 36:15.443
My favorite shirt.

36:15.620 --> 36:16.951
Best Christmas present l ever got.

36:17.121 --> 36:19.282
l must have been feeling
pretty generous that day.

36:19.457 --> 36:22.358
- Well, you're not getting it back.
- l don't want it back.

36:22.527 --> 36:24.688
Until you come back wearing it.

36:27.999 --> 36:30.092
You're doing the right thing,
you know.

36:31.069 --> 36:32.502
l know.

36:37.208 --> 36:38.607
Promise you'll write.

36:38.776 --> 36:40.073
l'll write.

36:40.245 --> 36:42.213
- And call.
- l'll call.

36:42.380 --> 36:43.870
And l'll call too.

36:44.048 --> 36:46.414
And maybe
you can even come visit me.

36:46.584 --> 36:48.711
lt's supposed to be beautiful
on the Brittany Coast.

36:52.357 --> 36:54.518
So, what time
does your plane leave?

36:55.126 --> 36:57.117
l have to leave here
at 7 in the morning.

36:58.429 --> 37:02.160
Well, that means
we've got a little over nine hours.

37:02.834 --> 37:05.064
That's all the time in the world.

37:06.404 --> 37:08.463
l'm tired of the lies,

37:09.807 --> 37:11.934
tired of the deception.

37:12.777 --> 37:15.541
Tired of the denial that defines
my daily existence.

37:21.519 --> 37:23.510
But what is truth?

37:24.389 --> 37:28.723
- l must look into my soul.
- ls it me or is this really awful?

37:28.893 --> 37:30.360
Jim.

37:31.296 --> 37:33.526
- lt's really awful.
- But how can l strip away the mask,

37:33.698 --> 37:34.722
remove the paint,

37:35.967 --> 37:39.334
cast away the armor that prevents me
from finding my true identity

37:39.504 --> 37:42.701
without taking away the shield
that protects us all?

37:44.742 --> 37:46.539
Clothes are the ultimate mask.

37:46.711 --> 37:50.807
Oh, my God, she's gonna do it.
She's gonna take off her clothes.

37:50.982 --> 37:52.813
- Only when we are truly naked...
- She's what?

37:52.984 --> 37:55.919
Well, this play may not be
as boring as we thought.

37:56.087 --> 37:58.055
When we explore
our innermost selves

37:58.990 --> 38:02.016
and become
what we were meant to be.

38:06.698 --> 38:08.962
Hang on, l'll just be a minute.

38:16.908 --> 38:18.535
Hold on.

38:21.479 --> 38:23.743
Just one second.

38:28.419 --> 38:30.046
Hold on.

38:37.829 --> 38:38.955
Looks like he has a friend.

38:44.836 --> 38:47.066
You know, on second thought,

38:48.339 --> 38:50.739
maybe l don't really wanna know
my innermost self.

38:51.909 --> 38:54.571
Maybe masks aren't so bad.

38:54.746 --> 38:58.443
After all,
if God wanted us to be naked,

38:58.883 --> 39:01.545
why did he invent sexy lingerie?

39:13.131 --> 39:16.157
Honey, you were just wonderful.

39:16.334 --> 39:19.303
Yeah, Bren.
The play sucked, but you were great.

39:19.470 --> 39:21.665
l thought you were actually
gonna take your clothes off.

39:21.839 --> 39:23.807
Yeah, a lot of people did.

39:23.975 --> 39:26.239
Hi, Brenda,
could l see you for a minute?

39:26.411 --> 39:28.311
Sure, Pablo.

39:33.051 --> 39:34.143
What was that?

39:34.318 --> 39:35.842
Pablo,
my parents were in the audience.

39:36.020 --> 39:38.580
l don't care if the pope
was in the audience, okay?

39:38.756 --> 39:39.780
That was a travesty.

39:40.591 --> 39:44.755
Your job is to deliver my lines
and take my direction.

39:44.929 --> 39:46.123
l thought it was funny.

39:46.297 --> 39:48.788
Well, l didn't say it wasn't funny.

39:48.966 --> 39:50.456
Look, everybody loved it.

39:50.635 --> 39:53.263
What happened to taking chances?
l took a chance and it worked.

39:53.438 --> 39:57.772
Hey, l gave you a break, okay?
And you turned my play into a farce.

39:58.710 --> 40:00.644
Look,
why don't you just stop pouting?

40:00.812 --> 40:03.337
lf you wanna go back to
the original script tomorrow night, fine.

40:03.514 --> 40:06.950
l'll do it. l'll take off all my clothes
if that'll make you happy.

40:09.887 --> 40:13.914
No, don't change a thing.
You were great.

40:18.496 --> 40:19.986
Thanks.

41:05.409 --> 41:07.343
Bingo.

41:10.047 --> 41:12.038
Hold it right there.

41:14.018 --> 41:17.545
- Damn.
- Don't move. Spread them.

41:18.523 --> 41:20.184
Now.

41:27.732 --> 41:29.632
That's the last of it.

41:30.868 --> 41:32.597
Why won't you let me
take you to the airport?

41:32.770 --> 41:34.795
lt's better this way, Brandon.

41:34.972 --> 41:36.337
Airport goodbyes
always make me feel

41:36.507 --> 41:38.236
like l'm in a scene
from some old movie.
