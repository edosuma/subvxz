20:59.841 --> 21:00.926
This is the one I really wanted.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.970
So your Christmas wishcame true?

21:02.970 --> 21:05.430
Mmm... not all of it.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.682
Well what was the rest of it?

21:06.723 --> 21:08.642
Oh, we don't tell ourChristmas wishes

21:08.642 --> 21:12.104
until after they come true.

21:15.732 --> 21:18.819
Olivia... I'm a soldier.

21:18.819 --> 21:22.823
And when I get orders,I obey them.

21:22.823 --> 21:27.995
Even on Christmas Day.

21:28.036 --> 21:30.914
Look... we're going to beworking together a lot on this.

21:30.956 --> 21:34.793
That is still an open question.

21:34.835 --> 21:39.840
Well... if you decided thatyou want to be a part of it

21:39.881 --> 21:44.136
then you know howto reach me.

21:44.136 --> 21:47.597
And now you knowhow to reach me.

21:47.639 --> 21:52.144
( phone ringing )

21:52.185 --> 21:53.103
This is unbelievable!

21:53.353 --> 21:56.898
I mean... why doesn't thisstuff ever happen to me?

21:56.940 --> 21:58.275
Did he say if he hasa girlfriend?

21:58.317 --> 21:59.234
Did he mention it?

21:59.276 --> 22:00.902
I didn't ask,he didn't tell.

22:00.902 --> 22:01.653
Ugh...

22:01.862 --> 22:03.822
I'm not interestedin a relationship.

22:03.864 --> 22:04.698
You know what?

22:04.948 --> 22:07.868
Sometimes I just want tothrow something at you!

22:07.868 --> 22:11.747
( Laughter )

22:11.747 --> 22:13.749
I didn't mean to hit youin the face, I'm sorry.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.543
Yeah right.

22:16.585 --> 22:19.087
Is Danielle still mad at you fordragging her up here from L.A.?

22:19.129 --> 22:21.214
For putting her in a new schoolright before Christmas,

22:21.214 --> 22:23.175
for ruining her entire life?

22:23.216 --> 22:23.967
Yeah.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.927
Teenagers, so dramatic.

22:25.969 --> 22:29.139
There was no oneas dramatic as you.

22:29.139 --> 22:31.266
Don't worry about her,she'll be fine.

22:31.266 --> 22:32.184
Why can't I?

22:32.392 --> 22:34.603
Because you're too youngto stand in line all night

22:34.644 --> 22:35.312
to buy a video game!

22:35.479 --> 22:37.105
Kelly's mom is letting her go.

22:37.147 --> 22:37.773
Oh, wait!

22:37.939 --> 22:39.232
Kelly's in L.A. and we're here.

22:39.232 --> 22:40.233
How could I forget?

22:40.484 --> 22:42.944
I guess that just provesthat Kelly's mom loves her more.

22:42.986 --> 22:44.738
Or does that mean she lovesher less?

22:44.780 --> 22:45.781
You're not funny.

22:45.822 --> 22:46.865
I'm a little bit funny.

22:46.907 --> 22:48.075
No, you're not.

22:48.075 --> 22:51.119
Danielle? Charlie?

22:51.119 --> 22:51.870
Hayes!

22:52.079 --> 22:54.998
Wow! I thought I'd neversee you again!

22:55.040 --> 22:56.083
This is so random!

22:56.083 --> 22:57.250
Do you like,live around here?

22:57.292 --> 22:58.376
Yes!

22:58.418 --> 22:59.211
Really?

22:59.252 --> 23:00.253
Didn't your mom tell you?

23:00.253 --> 23:03.215
She saw my dad this morning.

23:03.256 --> 23:06.134
Hi Hayes, nice to seeyou honey.

23:06.176 --> 23:08.929
My dad said you never gothis note.

23:08.970 --> 23:11.390
Ahh, the infamous Olivia Young.

23:11.431 --> 23:12.349
Infamous?

23:12.599 --> 23:15.602
I was involved in the greatOlivia Young search.

23:15.602 --> 23:16.853
There was a search?

23:16.895 --> 23:18.105
I'll explain.

23:18.105 --> 23:20.273
I'm Jill McGuigan,Scott's mother.

23:20.273 --> 23:21.274
Pleasure to meet you.

23:21.525 --> 23:24.069
He felt awful about leavingWhistler like that.

23:24.111 --> 23:27.322
But orders come when theycome, it's the army life.

23:27.364 --> 23:28.949
Yeah he, he told me today.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.283
That must be difficult.

23:30.325 --> 23:32.160
I've never thought of itthat way.

23:32.202 --> 23:36.206
My father was a soldier,my husband, my son...

23:36.248 --> 23:37.999
I'm proud of them all.

23:37.999 --> 23:39.126
Of course!

23:39.126 --> 23:42.754
Well I'm glad that he foundyou finally.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.297
Anyway... I'm just...

23:44.339 --> 23:45.799
Come on Hayes!

23:45.799 --> 23:47.759
We have to go check out.

23:47.801 --> 23:48.635
Here.

23:48.635 --> 23:49.261
Lovely to meet you.

23:49.302 --> 23:50.637
You as well.

23:50.679 --> 23:51.680
Come on, Hayes.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.306
Bye Hayes!

23:56.184 --> 23:56.935
Okay, okay.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.187
I saw Sergeant McGuiganat the bank...

23:59.229 --> 24:02.649
he's the liaison for thisoutreach program I'm doing.

24:02.691 --> 24:04.401
I didn't tell you guysbecause...

24:04.442 --> 24:05.402
Because you hated him.

24:05.443 --> 24:06.319
No, I don't!

24:06.319 --> 24:08.280
Because you're mad at him.

24:08.321 --> 24:10.740
Well, I was...

24:10.782 --> 24:13.368
Well... he tried to find you.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.870
He left you a note.

24:14.911 --> 24:16.621
Doesn't that mean something?

24:16.663 --> 24:20.125
It does, butit's complicated.

24:20.125 --> 24:22.169
We need bananas,and apples.

24:22.169 --> 24:23.086
You already have apples.

24:23.128 --> 24:24.337
Well then oranges.

24:24.337 --> 24:25.172
Come on.

24:25.213 --> 24:26.339
Alright.

24:26.339 --> 24:28.008
No, I'm getting bananas!

24:28.049 --> 24:29.468
Punk!

24:52.908 --> 24:55.869
( laughs )

24:55.869 --> 24:58.205
♪ Repeat the sounding joy.

24:58.205 --> 25:00.248
♪ Repeat the sounding joy.

25:00.290 --> 25:05.921
♪Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy.♪

25:24.147 --> 25:26.191
Oh, toy drive.

25:30.070 --> 25:33.907
Oh don't worry, it fills upas we get closer to Christmas.

25:33.907 --> 25:35.283
With used toys?

25:35.325 --> 25:35.992
Oh no, no!

25:36.034 --> 25:36.952
Newer ones too.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.079
We collect all sorts of toysfrom local branches,

25:39.079 --> 25:41.039
enough to fill a warehouse!

25:41.081 --> 25:42.916
The base liaison handlesdistribution,

25:42.916 --> 25:45.460
it's quite the undertaking.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.089
Where are you going?

25:49.130 --> 25:51.174
We can do better.

26:12.028 --> 26:13.822
These are the ground rules,Sergeant McGuigan.

26:13.863 --> 26:15.949
Our relationship remainsstrictly professional.

26:15.991 --> 26:18.034
This is going to be morethan merely a toy drive.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.828
So we have 23 days to getthis done

26:19.869 --> 26:22.038
and I intend to make this thebiggest and best event

26:22.080 --> 26:24.124
Fort Wilcox and Coastal NationalBank have ever had.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.293
So, I hope you're up for it.

26:29.045 --> 26:31.298
Are you going to sayanything?

26:31.298 --> 26:33.717
Sounds like a big effort.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.468
Christmas used to meansomething to me,

26:35.468 --> 26:37.304
I want that back.

26:37.345 --> 26:40.974
Do you know why I joinedthe army?

26:41.016 --> 26:43.143
To serve your country,I suppose?

26:43.184 --> 26:45.145
Yes, proudly, but it'smore than that.

26:45.145 --> 26:47.063
I like the feeling of beinga part of something bigger

26:47.105 --> 26:48.732
than myself.

26:48.732 --> 26:52.319
That's why I like the glaciersso much.

26:52.319 --> 26:55.739
Is that why you're a liaisonon this?

26:55.739 --> 26:57.032
Christmas is importantto these families

26:57.073 --> 27:00.118
and I just want to be ableto help.

27:00.160 --> 27:06.124
So yes, Olivia Young...also known as Olivia Roberts...

27:06.166 --> 27:08.543
I am up for it.

27:08.543 --> 27:10.378
Okay.

27:12.672 --> 27:17.344
You know, Hayes was so excitedto see your kids at the store.

27:17.344 --> 27:18.386
Mine were too.

27:18.678 --> 27:21.973
Hard to believe they get soattached after just one day.

27:22.015 --> 27:24.100
Okay, so Christmas trees.

27:31.983 --> 27:34.069
I thought we were goingto the Christmas tree lot.

27:34.069 --> 27:37.238
We are, I just have to doa few things first.

27:40.450 --> 27:44.996
What exactly do you do here,in the army?

27:45.038 --> 27:48.041
Part of a unit,the Army Rangers.

27:48.041 --> 27:53.046
We are... on call, always.

27:53.046 --> 27:56.091
Wherever we go isn't discussed,nor is what we do.

27:58.927 --> 27:59.803
Olivia...

28:00.011 --> 28:03.306
the army and my unit, my countryand my family...

28:03.348 --> 28:06.101
it's all part of the same mixfor me.

28:15.568 --> 28:17.445
Hello!

28:17.445 --> 28:18.446
Oh, Scott!

28:18.738 --> 28:20.198
When I called you this morningI said there was no rush!

28:20.240 --> 28:23.701
Hey, you send out an SOS,I show up... with help.

28:23.743 --> 28:25.453
Help, what?

28:25.495 --> 28:28.498

28:28.540 --> 28:30.291
Nice to meet you.

28:30.291 --> 28:30.917
You too!

28:31.084 --> 28:33.169
Ooh! This little guy's a kicker!

28:33.211 --> 28:33.920
Aww!

28:34.087 --> 28:35.255
At least Joe willbe home soon.

28:35.255 --> 28:36.131
It's our first.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.049
Olivia's in charge ofthe toy drive this year.

28:38.091 --> 28:39.467
It's going to be morethan that.

28:39.509 --> 28:41.636
Awesome!

28:44.431 --> 28:45.598
Well thank you,this looks great!

28:45.640 --> 28:47.475
And I love the lights outside!

28:47.475 --> 28:51.438
When Joe gets back, he'sgoing to be so thrilled.

28:51.438 --> 28:53.064
Um... Scott, I bakedsome cookies.

28:53.106 --> 28:55.233
I put a dozen in each bagfor the two of you.

28:55.275 --> 28:57.110
Can you go grab them?

28:58.403 --> 28:59.738
Sure.

29:02.991 --> 29:06.995
I heard about you,last Christmas... Whistler...

29:07.036 --> 29:09.247
He felt reallybad about it all.

29:09.289 --> 29:10.498
You know about that?

29:10.540 --> 29:12.500
Yeah, my brother'sin the same unit.

29:12.542 --> 29:15.128
Got called away just likethat and they didn't come back

29:15.128 --> 29:16.963
until after New Year's.

29:16.963 --> 29:21.050
Wait, so do you really neverknow anything

29:21.092 --> 29:22.635
about where they'regoing or why?

29:22.635 --> 29:25.388
I've learned to connectthe dots.

29:25.388 --> 29:28.266
Do you rememberthose hostages in Syria?

29:28.308 --> 29:30.393
They were rescued andreunited with their families

29:30.435 --> 29:33.146
at the White Houseon New Year's day?

29:33.188 --> 29:35.273
Oh... yeah, I saw iton the news.

29:35.315 --> 29:37.859
Happy reunion,everyone in tears.

29:37.859 --> 29:40.528
I mean, I was crying andI just watched it on TV.

29:40.570 --> 29:42.489
It takes a pretty special teamto go in there

29:42.489 --> 29:46.117
and do something like that.

29:46.159 --> 29:47.994
Are you saying Scottand your brother...?

29:47.994 --> 29:52.415
It's never discussed,no public recognition.

29:52.457 --> 29:55.585
No press conferences.

29:55.627 --> 29:58.379
They're the heroesno one knows about.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.139
Grabbed an extra bagfor your lazy brother

30:08.181 --> 30:10.225
but I swear, he mightnot get any of them.

30:10.266 --> 30:11.851
( Laughter )

30:16.689 --> 30:18.107
Hi! Come on in.

30:18.149 --> 30:19.651
Oh, hey Sarah.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.404
This is, uh, my neighbourSarah and her son Joey.

30:23.446 --> 30:25.949
I look after him sometimeswhen she teaches yoga.

30:25.990 --> 30:27.826
This is Oliviawith the toy drive!

30:27.867 --> 30:28.660

30:31.204 --> 30:34.249
Do you know Santa?

30:34.249 --> 30:34.999
Well...

30:35.208 --> 30:38.044
Can you tell himI don't want any toys,

When does his fatherget back?

30:55.520 --> 30:57.105

30:57.146 --> 30:59.190
Two thirds of the baseis deployed

30:59.232 --> 31:01.651
and the family deploymentcenter is shut down.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.903
Budget cuts, so...

31:03.945 --> 31:07.365
it's going to be a prettytough Christmas for the kids.

31:07.407 --> 31:10.201
I'm going to try to change that.

31:10.243 --> 31:14.789
Sergeant McGuigan... let's givethem a proper Christmas.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.337
So I guess I can't ask howhe broke his leg, can I?

32:02.378 --> 32:03.796
Sure, playing basketball.

32:03.796 --> 32:05.632
Is that the truth?

32:05.673 --> 32:06.799
Paul's an unbelievable soldier.

32:07.091 --> 32:10.470
I'd trust him with my life,but not on a basketball court.

32:10.470 --> 32:13.640
This is where he brokehis leg, in this gym.

32:13.681 --> 32:15.558
Okay?

32:17.644 --> 32:21.481
What you do, what you don't talkabout, doesn't scare you?

32:21.481 --> 32:26.653
Of course it does, butI don't let it stop me.

32:26.653 --> 32:32.075
And I do talk about it,just not out loud.

32:32.116 --> 32:33.201
You know, I have this placethat I go

32:33.242 --> 32:36.829
that helps me sortsome things out.

32:36.829 --> 32:39.540
I'll show you,maybe you'd like it.

32:46.673 --> 32:49.676
I come here before andafter every mission,

32:49.676 --> 32:52.178
and sometimes in between.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.889
It's been a long timesince I've been in a church.

32:58.101 --> 33:01.646
What if I don't...really believe anymore?

33:01.688 --> 33:06.025
Well... we all gofor different reasons.

33:06.025 --> 33:10.863
We don't have to go in if itmakes you uncomfortable.

34:21.516 --> 34:24.020
I know where you were today.

34:24.061 --> 34:25.772
What do you mean?

34:25.813 --> 34:27.648
Hayes texted me.

34:27.690 --> 34:31.860
She said you were withher dad... all day long.

34:31.902 --> 34:34.447
Don't read anything into that.

34:34.447 --> 34:35.989
We're working together.

34:36.032 --> 34:37.824
( chuckles )

34:37.824 --> 34:38.993
What?

34:39.034 --> 34:41.036
I know you like him.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.955
Have some fun!

34:42.996 --> 34:45.458
God, you can be soboring sometimes.

34:45.458 --> 34:48.543
Don't you have homeworkto do?

34:48.585 --> 34:49.879
Has he asked you out?

34:49.920 --> 34:55.510
No! And I'm too busy anyway.

34:55.551 --> 35:00.807
Hey... so, you're not mad atme anymore for making this move?

35:00.807 --> 35:02.850
No, I'm not mad.

35:02.892 --> 35:05.394
I'd like if we could spendChristmas at home this year

35:05.436 --> 35:08.314
like a real family.

35:08.314 --> 35:10.900
I like this house.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.444
Are you ever goingto finish unpacking?

35:13.486 --> 35:16.114
( laughs )

35:19.492 --> 35:22.537
( Announcement ) The trees are moving fast folks, get them soon before they sell out.

35:22.578 --> 35:23.830
It's for the soldiersand their families.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.414
I mean, many can'tafford trees.

35:25.456 --> 35:26.666
We want to surprise themfor Christmas.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.418
Don't you think we owe them thatat least at this time of year?

35:29.460 --> 35:32.380
And in return, I will put upsignage for your business...

35:32.380 --> 35:35.007
in every local branch ofthe Coastal National Bank.

35:35.007 --> 35:37.635
And, and have each one ofour tellers say...

35:37.677 --> 35:39.637
Can I say something?

35:39.679 --> 35:40.763
Yes of course, please.

35:40.805 --> 35:44.308
How many familiesare we talking here?

35:44.308 --> 35:45.560
As many as you canhelp with.

35:45.560 --> 35:48.187
It's a lot of free publicityand good karma.

35:48.187 --> 35:50.690
Do you know how many people comeinto our branches every day?

35:50.731 --> 35:53.526
And just imagine the smileson those kids' faces.

35:53.526 --> 35:54.861
Okay, okay, okay!

36:33.983 --> 36:35.735

Is Hayes always so specific?

38:17.128 --> 38:21.549
Well... to, um...

38:21.549 --> 38:23.551
Whistler.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.302
Whistler.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.225
Oh... that's better.

38:31.267 --> 38:32.685
Out of the work clothes?

38:32.685 --> 38:34.020

You okay?

38:40.693 --> 38:43.904
Mmmhmm.

38:43.946 --> 38:46.741
Well we've got to admit

38:46.782 --> 38:50.244
that the kids set us uppretty brilliantly.

38:50.286 --> 38:51.829
Yeah.

38:53.456 --> 38:56.542
But an Islanders fanand a Kings fan?

38:56.584 --> 38:58.711
Clearly our kids knownothing about the real world.

38:58.753 --> 39:00.046
Clearly they know nothing.

39:00.046 --> 39:03.716
( small laugh )

39:03.716 --> 39:07.636
In Whistler I said I wasn'tinterested in a relationship.

39:07.678 --> 39:11.223
Oh, I remember.

39:11.223 --> 39:14.185
What about now?

39:14.226 --> 39:19.565
Well, I should tell you thatI have some issues.

39:19.565 --> 39:23.778
Yeah, well... so do I,we all do.

39:23.819 --> 39:26.530
I guess.

39:26.572 --> 39:30.701
All we really have is the hereand now.

39:30.743 --> 39:32.787
That's true.

39:35.081 --> 39:36.999
Why don't we...

39:38.876 --> 39:44.215
do something that we did not geta chance to do in Whistler.

39:44.256 --> 39:46.258
What's that?

40:15.454 --> 40:19.125
So? How did it go?

40:19.166 --> 40:23.671
It was wonderful, romantic...he's so sweet.

40:23.671 --> 40:26.048
It's been a long timesince I've felt so...

40:26.090 --> 40:27.007
Aww, finally!

40:27.049 --> 40:28.134
Is this thing straight?

40:28.134 --> 40:29.969
Sure.

40:29.969 --> 40:31.470
And it felt good.

40:33.973 --> 40:35.766
There's just one questionthat I keep asking myself

40:35.808 --> 40:37.977
and I don't want to seemlike I'm diving in too soon

40:37.977 --> 40:40.604
or jumping to conclusions,but...

40:40.646 --> 40:42.815
do you think that I'm upfor this army life?

40:42.815 --> 40:45.109
It's not for everyone,you know.

40:45.151 --> 40:47.236
It's tough.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.779
She seems the type of woman

40:48.779 --> 40:50.823
who's up for anykind of challenge.

40:50.823 --> 40:54.160
Yeah she seems it, but...

40:54.160 --> 40:56.162
Give it a minute.

40:56.203 --> 40:59.290
She wasn't born to this lifethe way we were.

41:02.168 --> 41:04.295
Come on, Scott.

41:04.336 --> 41:06.172
If this is meant to be...

41:10.426 --> 41:13.304
You're right.

41:13.345 --> 41:15.014
Thanks Mom.

41:28.027 --> 41:30.696

41:37.703 --> 41:39.663

41:39.663 --> 41:41.957
Well then you will sing again.

44:21.575 --> 44:22.201
You're amazing!

44:22.368 --> 44:24.203
Oh please, what Sarah did...

44:24.244 --> 44:27.373
She wouldn't have done anyof that if it wasn't for you.

44:27.414 --> 44:28.207
That's the truth,

44:28.415 --> 44:30.042
so can you please takea compliment?

44:30.042 --> 44:30.959
If I was so amazing,

44:31.168 --> 44:32.211
then Mr. Sweeney fromthe Christmas tree lot

44:32.670 --> 44:36.131
would've returned at least oneof my dozen phone messages.

44:36.131 --> 44:39.259
Um... it's probably morelike two dozen.

44:39.301 --> 44:41.387
( Laughter )

44:44.306 --> 44:47.059
I like this... us.

44:47.101 --> 44:49.436
Yeah.

44:49.478 --> 44:51.188
Nobody's around...

44:51.230 --> 44:52.398
Mmm!

44:53.607 --> 44:56.193

45:21.593 --> 45:22.261

45:22.428 --> 45:24.138
Mr. Sweeney saysstop calling!

45:24.138 --> 45:24.888
( Laughter )

45:25.055 --> 45:26.265
He also says you can'thave a tree

45:26.306 --> 45:28.434
without all the trimmings.

45:29.810 --> 45:31.270
Oh... Another three truckson the way.

45:31.270 --> 45:33.021
That's great.

45:34.440 --> 45:35.149

45:35.190 --> 45:35.983
Thank you.

45:35.983 --> 45:37.484
Thank you.

45:37.526 --> 45:39.403
This is fantastic!

45:39.445 --> 45:41.905
Now will you take a compliment?

45:41.947 --> 45:44.074
It's amazing,you are amazing.

45:46.577 --> 45:48.454
Oh, they are going to beso happy.

45:48.454 --> 45:50.622
It has been a fantastic day.

45:50.664 --> 45:52.499
You were right...

45:52.541 --> 45:53.417
I was?

45:53.625 --> 45:55.085
Being part of somethingbigger than yourself

45:55.127 --> 45:57.045
is an incredible feeling.

45:59.214 --> 46:00.632
My choir director says we're in.

46:00.632 --> 46:01.633
That's fantastic!

46:01.633 --> 46:03.969
Can I be the wise man?

46:03.969 --> 46:06.764
I think there should bea wise woman in there.

46:06.805 --> 46:08.348
And that's me!

46:08.390 --> 46:09.600
Excuse me...

46:09.641 --> 46:11.143
McGuigan.

46:11.185 --> 46:12.144
Yes, Captain.

46:12.186 --> 46:13.604
Do you sing Mrs. McGuigan?

46:13.645 --> 46:16.315
Oh... no, no... tone deaf.

46:16.356 --> 46:19.276
But I am good at sewing soI can help with the costumes.

46:19.318 --> 46:21.111
That would be great,thank you.

46:21.111 --> 46:22.279
This is going to beso much fun.

46:22.321 --> 46:23.197
Mmmhmmm.

46:23.197 --> 46:24.239
Totally!

46:24.239 --> 46:25.282
I still can't get over those trees.

46:25.324 --> 46:26.325
Yeah, Merry Christmas!

46:26.366 --> 46:28.118
I know, there's so many!

46:28.160 --> 46:29.453
It's going to bea great Christmas.

46:29.495 --> 46:31.622
I've never seen anythinglike it!

46:31.663 --> 46:32.623
They're endless.

46:32.664 --> 46:34.333
Yes.

46:39.338 --> 46:42.090
You've got to go,right now?

46:42.132 --> 46:43.800
I'm just on alert.

46:45.636 --> 46:47.679
And you can't say where?

46:47.679 --> 46:49.473
Or why?

46:55.521 --> 46:56.605
Hey... finish eating.

46:56.647 --> 46:58.524
I made your favourite dessert...

46:58.524 --> 47:00.692
lemon meringue pie.

47:11.703 --> 47:14.164
Alright, they're watchinga movie.

47:31.890 --> 47:34.351
This is what I do.

47:39.439 --> 47:43.110
Well we knew this time wasgoing to come eventually.

47:43.151 --> 47:46.613
Yeah...

47:46.655 --> 47:49.241
This life isn'tfor everyone.

47:49.241 --> 47:52.244
No... no it's not.

47:52.244 --> 47:56.957
But what it's taught meis to live in the moment.

47:56.999 --> 48:01.044
All we really have isthe here and now...

48:01.086 --> 48:03.422
so let's make the most of that.

48:16.268 --> 48:18.270
And tomorrow?

48:33.160 --> 48:34.036

48:34.244 --> 48:39.458

48:50.427 --> 48:52.179

48:52.220 --> 48:54.264
Yeah.

48:58.560 --> 49:00.604

These past few days feltlike a military operation.

50:46.835 --> 50:49.755
Couldn't have done it withoutall those guys you enlisted.

50:49.755 --> 50:51.256
We've done everything!

50:51.256 --> 50:53.759
Trees, lights, gifts, food!

50:53.800 --> 50:58.847
And now we havea show to put on.

50:58.889 --> 51:00.766
You done good.

51:00.766 --> 51:02.726
We did good.

51:09.191 --> 51:12.277
Listen, I'm probably goingto have to leave soon.

51:12.319 --> 51:16.156
So we should maybe celebrateChristmas early.

51:16.198 --> 51:18.450
Are you saying you're notgoing to be back for Christmas?

51:18.450 --> 51:21.828
I'm saying I don't know.

51:21.870 --> 51:23.872
Or you can't say, won't say,don't say.

51:23.914 --> 51:26.458
No, don't make this harderthan it already is.

51:26.458 --> 51:28.710
I'm just confused, okay?

51:28.752 --> 51:31.630
I don't know how to feel...

51:31.630 --> 51:33.381
and I don't want you to go.

51:33.423 --> 51:35.133
I'll be back.

51:42.349 --> 51:43.016
Um... I should get home.

51:43.058 --> 51:44.017
Yeah.

51:44.059 --> 51:46.436
What about our early Christmas?

51:46.478 --> 51:47.604
I'll talk to the kids.

51:47.646 --> 51:49.106
Ok.

51:52.484 --> 51:54.528
Good day.

52:02.577 --> 52:03.620
Sergeant McGuigan invited...

52:03.662 --> 52:06.665
Mom... his name's Scott.

52:06.706 --> 52:09.417
Okay... well Scottinvited us to...

52:09.459 --> 52:12.796
I know, Hayes already texted us.

52:12.796 --> 52:15.465
Early Christmasat their place.

52:15.507 --> 52:17.467
Well how do you feelabout that?

52:17.509 --> 52:18.927
Charlie and I think it's cool,

52:18.969 --> 52:21.805
we get to celebrateChristmas twice.

52:21.847 --> 52:23.849
How do you feel about it?

52:23.890 --> 52:29.354
Mom, seriously...everything has a risk.

52:29.354 --> 52:30.981
Is he worth it?

52:31.022 --> 52:33.525
I say yes.

52:33.525 --> 52:36.653
And I also say that it'sokay to be scared...

52:36.695 --> 52:40.574
it just means you care.

52:40.574 --> 52:44.744
There's more laundryin the dryer, please.

52:44.786 --> 52:46.997
And when did you grow up?

52:50.709 --> 52:52.752
Oh, you've done it now.

52:52.794 --> 52:54.796
I have?

52:54.838 --> 52:56.756
( clears throat )

52:58.550 --> 53:01.553
And you can donate at any branchof the Coastal National Bank

53:01.595 --> 53:04.681
to support the troops and theirfamilies at Fort Wilcox...

53:04.723 --> 53:06.850
give them the bestChristmas ever!

53:06.892 --> 53:10.312
Let's get the family deploymentcenter back up and running.

53:10.353 --> 53:13.899
Coastal National Bank willmatch every dollar donated.

53:13.899 --> 53:16.610
This is Operation Christmas.

53:16.651 --> 53:20.363
So, Coastal National Bank willmatch every dollar donated?

53:20.405 --> 53:23.742
You said if you were out toemail the president, so I did.

53:23.742 --> 53:25.076
He liked the idea,gave me the go ahead...

53:25.118 --> 53:26.912
I CC'd you on allcorrespondence.

53:26.912 --> 53:28.830
Oh yes, I readall the emails.

53:28.872 --> 53:31.082
General Holt calledthe president of the bank

53:31.082 --> 53:32.626
to thank him himself.

53:32.667 --> 53:34.002
That's good, right?

53:34.044 --> 53:36.838
The Family Deployment Centerhelps soldiers transition

53:36.838 --> 53:39.007
between here and thereand back again,

53:39.049 --> 53:41.593
all while supporting thefamilies during deployment.

53:41.635 --> 53:44.012
General Holt startedit 15 years ago.

53:44.054 --> 53:47.849
To have it back would meaneverything to him.

53:47.849 --> 53:48.934
So I suppose it's onlya matter of time

53:48.975 --> 53:52.437
before you becomea manager...

53:52.479 --> 53:54.064
well isn't thatwhy you're doing this?

53:54.105 --> 53:56.733
No, actually...

53:56.775 --> 53:59.611
everyone at Fort Wilcoxis so selfless.

53:59.611 --> 54:01.613
All they do is give...

54:01.613 --> 54:05.659
they deserve a specialChristmas.

54:05.659 --> 54:07.535
Hmm...

54:07.869 --> 54:09.579
You know something?

54:09.621 --> 54:11.706
Okay.

54:11.748 --> 54:13.250
I like you.

54:38.942 --> 54:39.651
This is Scott.

54:39.651 --> 54:41.903
Leave me a message.

55:51.139 --> 55:51.806
That's not how you...

55:51.973 --> 55:52.932
show me how to use chopsticks.

55:52.974 --> 55:55.226
No...

55:55.226 --> 55:57.896
Like that...

55:57.896 --> 55:59.439
Yes, twist it.

55:59.439 --> 56:03.109
And you want to flip it up in one motion.

56:03.109 --> 56:05.278
Perfect!

56:05.320 --> 56:07.864
Mom, are you okay?

56:07.906 --> 56:10.950
It's time we finished unpacking.

56:10.950 --> 56:11.785
Right now?

56:11.993 --> 56:13.661
I jumped into all this stuffat Fort Wilcox

56:13.703 --> 56:15.747
and our own houseis still in disarray.

56:15.789 --> 56:17.791
Okay, Olivia...

56:17.832 --> 56:20.418
I need to feellike this is home.

56:20.418 --> 56:23.588
So tonight, we are going tofinish getting this place ready

56:23.588 --> 56:25.632
for the holidays. Okay?

56:25.632 --> 56:26.132
Yeah.

56:26.174 --> 56:26.674
Okay.

56:26.800 --> 56:27.801
Home for Christmas!

56:28.176 --> 56:31.596
But, I thought we were goingto Sergeant M's for Christmas.

56:31.596 --> 56:35.141
Oh... honey, we are.

56:35.183 --> 56:38.978
Early Christmas, we are.

56:39.020 --> 56:43.108
But he's leaving soon andwe need to say goodbye.

56:43.149 --> 56:47.070
I don't want to say goodbyeto Sergeant M.

56:47.070 --> 56:52.283
Me neither,but it's his job.

56:52.283 --> 56:54.786
It's what he does.

56:54.786 --> 56:58.123
So... everybody get a box.

57:03.837 --> 57:06.131
Here, let me take this little guy.

57:06.131 --> 57:08.174
This is not your size...

57:14.556 --> 57:18.935
I have to ask...how do you do this?

57:18.977 --> 57:22.355
Faith... keeping positive,

57:22.397 --> 57:25.650
other army wives and husbands.

57:25.650 --> 57:27.652
There's strength in numbers,you know.

57:27.652 --> 57:30.238
I don't think I have it in meto deal with army life.

57:30.280 --> 57:33.158
You guys are all so muchstronger than me.

57:33.158 --> 57:37.036
But Olivia, I can see thatyou love him.

57:39.998 --> 57:43.835
This life is so much differentthan I've ever known.

57:43.835 --> 57:45.962
I would drive him crazy.

57:50.175 --> 57:53.052
He's leaving soon.

57:53.052 --> 57:56.598
Rangers don't leave the baseto play games.

57:56.639 --> 58:01.394
You'll be on his mind,you need to talk to him.

58:11.905 --> 58:14.741
♪ Away in a manger

58:14.782 --> 58:18.620
♪ No crib for a bed...

58:18.661 --> 58:20.330
What time did Scott sayhe was going to be here?

58:20.371 --> 58:22.874
Soon, he's just runninga little late.

58:22.874 --> 58:25.376
He'll be here soon.

58:25.418 --> 58:28.254
Can we stop for a second?

58:28.296 --> 58:30.089
I was hoping for something,I don't know,

58:30.131 --> 58:31.966
a little more upbeat.

58:31.966 --> 58:34.093
How about "The 12 Daysof Christmas"?

58:34.135 --> 58:36.221
Yeah, and then every memberof the choir would have a solo

58:36.262 --> 58:39.182
and that would take thepressure off me a little bit.

58:39.224 --> 58:39.933
That'd be cool.

58:39.974 --> 58:41.809
Excellent idea, guys.

58:41.851 --> 58:44.771
Would you get them in hereand rehearse it?

58:44.771 --> 58:47.232
You know Mom, you're prettygood at this.

58:47.273 --> 58:48.191
Don't tell anyone

58:48.399 --> 58:50.485
but I have absolutely no ideawhat I'm doing.

58:50.527 --> 58:52.195
My lips are sealed.

58:54.447 --> 58:55.073
Hey Sarah!

58:55.114 --> 58:56.366
Hi!

58:56.366 --> 58:58.117
You're bringing reinforcements.

58:58.159 --> 58:59.077
The cavalry!

58:59.327 --> 59:01.913
May I introduce the fabulousFort Wilcox dancers.

59:01.913 --> 59:02.539
Love it.

59:02.705 --> 59:03.331
And these guys are what I call

59:03.665 --> 59:05.083
all-purpose dancersand singers,

59:05.124 --> 59:06.125
whatever we need.

59:06.167 --> 59:08.211
Fantastic, thank you.

59:08.253 --> 59:09.254
Becky, would you take themover there

59:09.254 --> 59:10.838
and assign them numbers?

59:10.880 --> 59:11.923
No problem.

59:12.173 --> 59:14.425
Then there's me... I've beenin six musicals, two dramas,

59:14.425 --> 59:15.843
an Agatha Christie mystery

59:15.885 --> 59:18.388
and I've even played Tiny Timwhen I was little.

59:18.388 --> 59:20.682
Sarah, you are extraordinary.

59:20.682 --> 59:23.059
So does extraordinaryget a solo?

59:23.101 --> 59:25.311
You should hear my versionof Santa Baby.

59:25.353 --> 59:26.271
Done!

59:26.271 --> 59:29.399
Yes, thank you!

59:29.440 --> 59:31.067
Okay...

59:34.362 --> 59:35.196
Sorry I'm late.

59:35.405 --> 59:37.323
I can't stay, we havea re-con briefing.

59:37.365 --> 59:39.117
How's it going here?

59:39.158 --> 59:39.784
Hectic.

59:39.826 --> 59:40.994
Yeah, I see that.

59:41.035 --> 59:42.328
Yeah.

59:42.370 --> 59:44.914
Um... you hear anything?

59:44.956 --> 59:47.458
Yeah, we leave tomorrow.

59:47.458 --> 59:49.252
It'll be okay.

59:51.045 --> 59:54.007
Sorry to interrupt,I need your help.

59:54.048 --> 59:55.967
It's the dancers.

59:56.009 --> 59:58.052
Go ahead, I have to run anyway.

59:58.094 --> 01:00:00.638
Okay, um... I need to talkto you at some point.

01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:08.938
And all of a sudden,there he was.

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:12.442
Ben... my handsome,wonderful Benjamin.

01:00:12.483 --> 01:00:15.320
Home two months early...surprise!

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.071
Of course, I lose it.

01:00:17.113 --> 01:00:18.865
With all of that mascararunning down my face,

01:00:18.906 --> 01:00:23.119
I looked like a blubberingraccoon.

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:26.831
The reunions make itall worthwhile, don't they?

01:00:26.831 --> 01:00:29.792
I'm so excitedfor my next one.

01:00:29.834 --> 01:00:32.128
You'll be havingyours real soon.

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:34.172
Actually, no.

01:00:34.213 --> 01:00:36.090
What?

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:38.134
Yeah, um... I just found outthis morning

01:00:38.176 --> 01:00:40.011
that Joe and the squadron arestaying on

01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:41.596
for a few more months.

01:00:41.637 --> 01:00:43.181
Oh Becky, I'm so sorry.

01:00:43.222 --> 01:00:44.849
I know he was going to behere for the birth.

01:00:44.849 --> 01:00:48.353
It's okay, I'm just a littleemotional right now, so...

01:00:48.353 --> 01:00:50.521
We'll be here.

01:00:50.563 --> 01:00:52.106
Thanks.

01:00:52.148 --> 01:00:54.692
I know I can always counton you gals.

01:00:57.904 --> 01:01:00.406
Olivia?

01:01:00.448 --> 01:01:02.408
Olivia?

01:01:02.408 --> 01:01:03.576
You alright?

01:01:03.576 --> 01:01:05.078
Oh... yeah.

01:01:05.119 --> 01:01:07.497
Sorry, just tired.

01:01:07.538 --> 01:01:09.332
So much on my plate.

01:01:09.374 --> 01:01:12.418
Operation Christmas,the bank, kids...

01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:15.880
there should be more hoursin the day.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:18.341
You don't need to pretend,Olivia.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:21.511
You're one of us now,we get it.

01:01:21.552 --> 01:01:23.471
You're worried.

01:01:33.272 --> 01:01:36.234
Scott's a good man.

01:01:36.234 --> 01:01:41.447
He deserves the truth.

01:01:41.447 --> 01:01:44.242
I know.

01:01:47.662 --> 01:01:48.621
What is it?

01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:50.331
Whoa!

01:01:50.331 --> 01:01:52.625
It's a Morse code signal light,come here.

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:53.418
Cool!

01:01:53.459 --> 01:01:54.627
It works!

01:01:54.669 --> 01:01:56.254
Look.

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:00.508
Thanks Sergeant M.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:03.136
You're welcome.Merry Christmas, buddy.

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:08.933
And Hayes, I made somethingspecial for you.

01:02:08.933 --> 01:02:10.643
Danielle, phone!

01:02:13.062 --> 01:02:14.021
Oh!

01:02:14.063 --> 01:02:14.689
It's an ornament!

01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:17.191
Look Daddy, it's so pretty!

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:18.276
Thank you.

01:02:18.276 --> 01:02:19.235
You're welcome.

01:02:19.444 --> 01:02:22.572
Every Christmas Day we getone that has our name

01:02:22.613 --> 01:02:24.282
and the year on it.

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:25.450
Then we put it on the tree.

01:02:25.491 --> 01:02:26.868
My parents started it withme and my sister

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:29.954
so I carried on the traditionwith my kids.

01:02:29.954 --> 01:02:31.664
There's something to be saidfor tradition.

01:02:31.664 --> 01:02:32.415
Yeah.

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.041
Come on Hayes,put it on the tree.

01:02:34.083 --> 01:02:35.168
Yeah, get a spot.

01:02:35.168 --> 01:02:37.044
Come on!

01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:39.630
Oh, that's a good spot.

01:02:39.672 --> 01:02:41.591
It's beautiful.

01:02:42.383 --> 01:02:43.760
I love you!

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:47.597
I love you too.

01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:51.684
Merry early Christmas.

01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:53.686
Merry early Christmas.

01:02:54.979 --> 01:02:56.814
Well Danielle, you're up!

01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:09.202
Merry Christmas.

01:03:09.243 --> 01:03:11.370
It's okay, you can open it.

01:03:21.088 --> 01:03:23.633
Danielle took it at the glacierlast year.

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:30.431
It's beautiful.

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:33.684
Really, thank you.

01:03:33.684 --> 01:03:35.603
You're welcome.

01:03:38.689 --> 01:03:40.399
I don't want this to end.

01:03:40.441 --> 01:03:41.192
Well neither do I.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.487
No Scott, please...let me finish.

01:03:44.529 --> 01:03:47.949
For our kids...

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:51.244
I don't wantthis to end for them.

01:03:51.285 --> 01:03:54.747
And they've grown so close,and...

01:03:54.789 --> 01:04:00.586
I want that to continue.

01:04:00.628 --> 01:04:03.589
But...

01:04:03.631 --> 01:04:08.719
I don't have it in meto live this army life.

01:04:08.719 --> 01:04:10.054
I, I, I... just don't.

01:04:10.054 --> 01:04:11.138
What, you're ending this?

01:04:11.389 --> 01:04:16.102
Two Christmases cut short,I mean it just feels like...

01:04:16.143 --> 01:04:17.186
it wasn't meant to be.

01:04:17.228 --> 01:04:20.356
I completely disagree.

01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:22.525
It feels so meant to be.

01:04:25.611 --> 01:04:30.616
Do you know what I seewhen I look at you?

01:04:30.658 --> 01:04:35.121
I see a hero andan amazing man...

01:04:35.121 --> 01:04:41.252
and I need you to know how muchI respect that.

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:44.797
But I know what it feels liketo be left alone

01:04:44.839 --> 01:04:47.174
and I can't go back there.

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:51.095
I can't be with someone whomight have to go at any moment,

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:52.597
not knowing whereyou are,

01:04:52.638 --> 01:05:00.646
if you're okay or not, if...if you're safe.

01:05:00.646 --> 01:05:01.731
I just...

01:05:04.525 --> 01:05:07.612
So you're afraidof the unknown?

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:11.949
Life is full of unknowns.

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:13.576
I could be a school teacherand get in a car wreck

01:05:13.618 --> 01:05:15.620
on the way to work,it happens.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:16.329
Scott...

01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:18.164
It happened.

01:05:18.205 --> 01:05:19.749
To my wife.

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:24.503
And sure, what I do puts mein harm's way a little more,

01:05:24.545 --> 01:05:25.922
I get that.

01:05:35.681 --> 01:05:40.227
When I look at you,do you know what I see?

01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:42.563
I see you.

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:48.819
Your kids are happy,

01:05:48.861 --> 01:05:51.238
you got a new jobthat you love,

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.491
new friends, a senseof community...

01:05:53.532 --> 01:05:56.118
a sense of family...

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:59.372
and a guy who's crazyabout you.

01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:04.669
You're going to let, what,fear stop all that?

01:06:04.669 --> 01:06:05.961
Olivia, what do you need?

01:06:06.003 --> 01:06:08.464
What can I do?

01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:12.843
Let us happen.

01:06:12.885 --> 01:06:17.556
That fear is real for me.

01:06:17.598 --> 01:06:19.600
I can't.

01:06:19.642 --> 01:06:21.811
I'm sorry.

01:06:28.526 --> 01:06:32.697

Thank you, thank you.

01:08:56.590 --> 01:08:59.593
And you on the piano,that was fabulous.

01:08:59.635 --> 01:09:02.805
So, are you single?

01:09:02.846 --> 01:09:06.308
Okay, well... that is definitelymaking it in the show.

01:09:06.350 --> 01:09:08.519
Guys, we still need a finale.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:09.687
Don't I know it?

01:09:09.728 --> 01:09:11.479
But every idea I've come upwith so far...

01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:12.564
Stinks?

01:09:12.606 --> 01:09:14.774
That's one way to put it.

01:09:14.774 --> 01:09:17.819
Well, better decideon something soon.

01:09:17.862 --> 01:09:19.572
Yeah.

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:22.032
Aww, thank you so muchfor asking me to do that.

01:09:22.032 --> 01:09:24.033
It was so fun beingon stage again.

01:09:24.033 --> 01:09:24.910
You did so good!

01:09:24.952 --> 01:09:25.786
Thank you.

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:27.955
But there is one thingI have to tell you

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:29.415
and it's very important.

01:09:29.456 --> 01:09:29.999
What?

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:30.791
You're an idiot!

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.542
Everybody can seethat you like him.

01:09:32.542 --> 01:09:33.877
Why can't you?

01:09:33.919 --> 01:09:35.379
You love Scott.

01:09:35.379 --> 01:09:36.671
You make it sound so simple.

01:09:36.714 --> 01:09:37.381
Because it is.

01:09:37.381 --> 01:09:38.090
No, it's not.

01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:38.841
Yes it is!

01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:39.884
No.

01:09:40.134 --> 01:09:42.636
I went into the church to saygoodbye and it tore me up.

01:09:42.678 --> 01:09:44.555
I don't even knowwhere he's going.

01:09:44.596 --> 01:09:46.348
To keep us safe.

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:48.517
Yeah, by putting himselfin danger.

01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:49.894
I don't know howto live that way.

01:09:49.894 --> 01:09:51.729
Okay, well hold on a second!

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:54.064
So you learn.

01:09:54.064 --> 01:09:55.566
After your divorce,you just...

01:09:55.608 --> 01:09:57.943
you put up this wall that even Icouldn't deal with and,

01:09:57.943 --> 01:09:59.862
and then you wanted tobring your kids here

01:09:59.862 --> 01:10:01.030
and start a whole new chapter.

01:10:01.071 --> 01:10:02.406
Well, wake up Olivia!

01:10:02.448 --> 01:10:04.408
This is your new chapter.

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:07.411
Do not put up another wall,please.

01:10:07.411 --> 01:10:10.873
Besides, did you ever considerthat maybe you won't lose him?

01:10:15.002 --> 01:10:17.212
Just saying...

01:10:26.096 --> 01:10:28.599
So, you're goingto deny yourself, and Scott,

01:10:28.599 --> 01:10:30.100
and the kids' happiness

01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:32.102
based solely on what if's?

01:10:32.102 --> 01:10:33.103
On fear?

01:10:33.103 --> 01:10:35.397
Putting your entire lifeon hold

01:10:35.439 --> 01:10:37.608
for something that mightnever happen?

01:10:37.608 --> 01:10:41.487
I'm sorry, but thatis not my sister.

01:10:41.528 --> 01:10:45.866
That... that is a coward.

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:49.161
And I only say thatbecause I love you.

01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:56.543
Just think about it.

01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:07.763
A lot of movement tonight.

01:11:08.013 --> 01:11:10.641
You should've said somethingearlier at rehearsal!

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:12.726
Well, I didn't wantto be a bother.

01:11:12.768 --> 01:11:14.144
No, seriously!

01:11:14.144 --> 01:11:15.646

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.740

01:11:27.658 --> 01:11:28.367

01:11:34.039 --> 01:11:35.874

01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:51.765
( Baby cries )

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:54.226
Meet our baby boy!

01:11:54.268 --> 01:11:56.937
Simon Joseph Fowler.

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:59.606
He's incredible!

01:11:59.648 --> 01:12:00.774
He has your nose!

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:03.527
( laughs )

01:12:03.569 --> 01:12:05.863
It's too bad, huh.

01:12:05.863 --> 01:12:08.115
10 fingers and 10 toes.

01:12:08.115 --> 01:12:11.160
He's in perfect healthand so am I.

01:12:11.201 --> 01:12:13.704
I am so sorry I wasn't there,babe.

01:12:13.704 --> 01:12:15.539
I'm sorry you had to do thison your own.

01:12:15.581 --> 01:12:17.750
Oh Joe, stop it.

01:12:17.750 --> 01:12:19.543
I was fine.

01:12:19.543 --> 01:12:22.129
I had Olivia and Sarahwith me.

01:12:22.129 --> 01:12:23.881
Hi!

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:26.884
I know.

01:12:34.058 --> 01:12:36.643
Can you say hi?

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:38.354
Hi Daddy.

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:43.025
Oh my God.

01:12:43.067 --> 01:12:45.944
( Crying )

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:42.417
Oh, there you are!

01:13:42.459 --> 01:13:44.670
Come in!

01:13:44.711 --> 01:13:46.046
A baby boy, how wonderful.

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:46.964
Yes, it's a miracle.

01:13:47.005 --> 01:13:47.965
A Christmas miracle.

01:13:47.965 --> 01:13:49.049
Here, let me take your coat.

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:50.050
Oh, thank you.

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:50.801
Come in, come in.

01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:52.052
I'm exhausted.

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:53.679
Oh, I bet you are.

01:13:53.679 --> 01:13:55.639
Oh...

01:13:55.639 --> 01:13:58.142
Um... any word from Scott?

01:13:58.142 --> 01:14:00.269
No, no... we never hear.

01:14:01.979 --> 01:14:03.439
Come in.

01:14:06.191 --> 01:14:10.154
You know, uh... I disagreethat you don't have it in you,

01:14:10.154 --> 01:14:11.822
to love a soldier.

01:14:11.864 --> 01:14:14.158
You just have to chooseto do it, that's all.

01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:15.951
If you're in love,you choose love.

01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:17.286
That's what my husband and I did

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:20.080
and no one evertook that away.

01:14:20.122 --> 01:14:21.665
I just don't know how.

01:14:21.665 --> 01:14:24.042
Please... don't run away.

01:14:24.084 --> 01:14:28.088
When Scott talks about you,his whole face lights up.

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:30.007
You should see that.

01:14:41.476 --> 01:14:42.269
Jill...

01:14:42.311 --> 01:14:44.271
Yes?

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.857
Why aren't you afraidfor him right now?

01:14:46.857 --> 01:14:49.359
You think I'm not afraid?

01:14:49.401 --> 01:14:50.903
I am.

01:14:50.944 --> 01:14:52.696
So what do you do?

01:14:52.696 --> 01:14:56.283
I try not to fret over thingsI can't control, and...

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:57.326
if I lose perspective,

01:14:57.326 --> 01:15:01.497
I find a quiet placeand I pray.

01:15:14.885 --> 01:15:16.386
Hey.

01:15:16.386 --> 01:15:19.973
I thought you might be here.

01:15:20.015 --> 01:15:22.935
I love this church.

01:15:22.976 --> 01:15:25.229
Yeah.

01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:28.774
It's so peaceful.

01:15:28.815 --> 01:15:32.736
Hey... I'm an uncle now!

01:15:32.736 --> 01:15:34.821
Thanks for what you didlast night.

01:15:34.863 --> 01:15:36.365
You're welcome.

01:15:36.406 --> 01:15:38.951
It was an experience!

01:15:46.792 --> 01:15:49.253
I wish I was there.

01:15:49.253 --> 01:15:53.840
With Scott and my unit.

01:15:53.882 --> 01:15:55.884
I'm a part of them.

01:15:59.096 --> 01:16:03.934
What if something happensto your unit?

01:16:03.934 --> 01:16:06.478
They don't come back?

01:16:12.776 --> 01:16:14.945
You can't think like that.

01:16:14.945 --> 01:16:17.823
We have a job to do.

01:16:17.864 --> 01:16:20.284
You going to be okay?

01:16:22.953 --> 01:16:26.623
Yeah.

01:16:26.623 --> 01:16:31.420
I finally know what I need,not just what I want.

01:16:31.461 --> 01:16:33.588
I'll be fine.

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:46.351
Charlie?

01:16:46.393 --> 01:16:47.728
What are you doing?

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:51.064
Seeing if Sergeant Mgets my message.

01:16:51.106 --> 01:16:54.484
I miss him.

01:16:54.484 --> 01:16:56.612
I know, honey.

01:16:59.323 --> 01:17:04.453
I'm sending him an SOSbut he's not answering.

01:17:04.494 --> 01:17:07.331
We don't know where he is.

01:17:07.372 --> 01:17:10.459
But he's probablyreally far away.

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:13.503
It might have to be a reallystrong light

01:17:13.545 --> 01:17:17.215
to carry a message that far.

01:17:17.257 --> 01:17:18.216
But if he did see it,

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:22.429
he would have to send a messageback home, right?

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:28.518
Because if he didn't, wewouldn't know he was okay.

01:17:32.939 --> 01:17:38.862
If he sees it, he'll senda message.

01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:41.573
I know he will.

01:17:47.371 --> 01:17:51.333
A message back home.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:54.544
Now I know how to end the show.

01:17:54.544 --> 01:17:56.380
You're a genius.

01:17:56.421 --> 01:17:58.548
A genius!

01:17:58.590 --> 01:18:01.551
But, even a geniusneeds his sleep.

01:18:01.551 --> 01:18:04.680
So... let's get to bed.

01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:14.272
Hey...

01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:21.029
You know, if you wantto marry him...

01:18:21.071 --> 01:18:24.658
Danielle and I,we're cool with that.

01:18:24.699 --> 01:18:27.536
Just saying.

01:18:30.163 --> 01:18:31.456
Sweet dreams.

01:18:31.456 --> 01:18:33.083
Good night.

01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:34.459
You too.

01:18:34.459 --> 01:18:35.544
Good night.

01:18:42.426 --> 01:18:44.261
Okay, can we get the armydrill team in here?

01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:44.720
Yup.

01:18:44.761 --> 01:18:46.930
Where are they?

01:18:46.930 --> 01:18:47.931
Are we really going to pullthis off?

01:18:47.931 --> 01:18:49.474
Olivia, breathe, breathe.

01:18:49.516 --> 01:18:51.518
In through the nose,out through the mouth.

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.563
And again, in throughthe nose... that's it.

01:18:54.604 --> 01:18:55.939
We put togethera great team,

01:18:55.939 --> 01:18:57.274
the dance troupe isgoing to be fabulous.

01:18:57.274 --> 01:18:59.443
This is not even close tomy worst dress rehearsal.

01:18:59.443 --> 01:19:00.652
It's a great show.

01:19:00.652 --> 01:19:01.611
Okay.

01:19:01.653 --> 01:19:02.404
Hey!

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:02.946
Sorry, I'm late.

01:19:03.113 --> 01:19:03.905
You can blame my boss.

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:05.991
But I am here now so whatcan I do for you?

01:19:06.032 --> 01:19:07.242
Talk me off a ledge.

01:19:07.284 --> 01:19:08.201
What?

01:19:08.452 --> 01:19:09.411
You've got a great show,don't worry about anything.

01:19:09.453 --> 01:19:11.246
No, no, no... not that.

01:19:11.288 --> 01:19:13.915
I was an idiot about Scott,you were right.

01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:15.333
Do you think he'll forgive me?

01:19:15.375 --> 01:19:17.961
Sure. And I'm always right.

01:19:17.961 --> 01:19:18.753
But you know what?

01:19:18.962 --> 01:19:20.756
