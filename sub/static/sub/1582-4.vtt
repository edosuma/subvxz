01:01.504 --> 01:02.837
Now, I, Bart Simpson,

01:02.872 --> 01:05.473
shall send the first coaster
down the track.

01:05.507 --> 01:06.508
Hmm.

01:16.085 --> 01:19.721
No, for once,
I want to go first.

01:19.755 --> 01:22.657
But, Milhouse, I already
let you push me on the swings.

01:22.692 --> 01:25.160
And it's an honor,
but I'm doing this.

01:25.194 --> 01:27.062
Ow! Knock it off, Milhouse!

01:28.197 --> 01:31.132
Eat safety bar!

01:31.167 --> 01:33.735
Why are we best friends?

01:33.769 --> 01:36.471
Because your seat
was behind mine!

01:44.513 --> 01:47.082
Feels like this playdate's
gone on forever.

01:47.116 --> 01:48.416
I'll handle this.

01:48.451 --> 01:51.753
"Dear Weirdo,
pick up weirdo kid."

01:51.787 --> 01:52.787
And send.

01:52.822 --> 01:53.788
Aah!

01:53.823 --> 01:55.790
Did you eat a peanut?

01:55.825 --> 01:58.026
No, I just sniffed a nectarine.

01:58.060 --> 01:59.327
It's okay.

01:59.362 --> 02:01.463
I can breathe
through my tear ducts.

02:04.467 --> 02:05.967
Tell me if this
gets annoying.

02:07.837 --> 02:11.272
I think I'm gonna throw up
the mac and cheese you fed me.

02:11.307 --> 02:12.507
I'm not supposed to have it.

02:12.541 --> 02:15.110
That's why I had so much.

02:15.144 --> 02:16.711
What the...?!

02:16.746 --> 02:19.681
If this kid's dad isn't
here in one second,

02:19.715 --> 02:22.017
he's going in the garbage can.

02:23.653 --> 02:25.186
Hey, guys!

02:25.221 --> 02:27.956
Who wants a whiff
of New Kirk Smell?

02:27.990 --> 02:29.090
"YOLO"?

02:29.125 --> 02:30.892
You Only Live Once.

02:30.926 --> 02:33.094
Once again, cats have it better.

02:33.129 --> 02:34.562
Kirk Van Houten.

02:34.597 --> 02:37.365
I hope you're not having
a midlife crisis.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.467
Please.
Just 'cause I bought a new car,

02:39.502 --> 02:40.635
lost a little weight

02:40.670 --> 02:42.537
and started taking
a DJ class,

02:42.571 --> 02:45.340
everyone thinks
I'm having a midlife crisis.

02:45.374 --> 02:47.442
Dad! You got me
a skateboard?

02:47.476 --> 02:48.677
It's for me.

02:48.711 --> 02:49.844
Now get in the back.

02:49.879 --> 02:51.012
And while you're there,

02:51.047 --> 02:53.281
use this cream to
massage the leather.

02:55.851 --> 02:58.420
To the tooth-whitening kiosk!

02:59.655 --> 03:03.191
I'm sorry, but does Kirk
know how silly he looks?

03:03.225 --> 03:04.559
Look at me!

03:04.593 --> 03:06.828
I'm afraid of dying.

03:06.862 --> 03:08.229
Oh, Homie.

03:08.264 --> 03:09.831
I'm so glad you're happy

03:09.865 --> 03:12.600
with your life
just the way it is.

03:12.635 --> 03:15.136
You've had the same
job, same car,

03:15.171 --> 03:18.039
same house for 20 years.

03:18.074 --> 03:20.275
And that's all
you'll ever have.

03:20.309 --> 03:22.744
A cycle you'll never ever,

03:22.778 --> 03:24.879
ever, ever, ever,

03:24.914 --> 03:26.915
ever change.

03:26.949 --> 03:29.384
And you're okay with it!

03:30.953 --> 03:33.555
Like I say night after night

03:33.589 --> 03:35.323
after night...

03:35.357 --> 03:37.358
nighty-night.

03:41.097 --> 03:44.632
Kent Brockman is here
for your interview.

04:00.483 --> 04:02.717
So, Kent, what brings you here?

04:02.752 --> 04:05.086
The miraculous tale
of how we lost, then found,

04:05.121 --> 04:06.988
our Lost and Found box?

04:07.022 --> 04:08.790
Actually, Principal Skinner,
I'm here to talk

04:08.824 --> 04:09.924
about something else...

04:09.959 --> 04:10.925
cheating!

04:12.128 --> 04:14.095
I thought this was a puff piece.

04:14.130 --> 04:15.296
You're wearing a sweater.

04:15.331 --> 04:17.899
This journalism just turned...

04:17.933 --> 04:19.666
gotcha!

04:19.702 --> 04:21.836
That's right, Channel 6
will uncover the truth

04:21.870 --> 04:24.506
in a five-part series
two minutes a day.

04:24.540 --> 04:27.108
People, make room for your local
Emmy nomination certificates.

04:27.143 --> 04:28.843
No, do not make room.

04:28.878 --> 04:30.378
Except for Mr. Largo
and his diet,

04:30.412 --> 04:31.846
there's no cheating
in this school.

04:31.881 --> 04:33.181
These 30 identical

04:33.215 --> 04:36.117
"What I Did This Summer"
essays say different.

04:36.152 --> 04:37.318
Um...

04:43.793 --> 04:46.294
Myra, don't I have
another appointment?

04:46.328 --> 04:48.963
Oh, this is your first
appointment ever.

04:48.998 --> 04:51.065
Let's take a look
at this monitor.

04:54.603 --> 04:57.472
<i>This school is more corrupt</i>
<i>than the Italian parliament.</i>

04:57.506 --> 04:58.973
<i>If these children</i>
<i>are our future,</i>

04:59.008 --> 05:02.377
<i>then I, for one,</i>
<i>do not want to live.</i>

05:09.051 --> 05:10.318
Ha-ha.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.488
Please don't air this.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.690
I'll tell you the winners of
the kickball games in advance.

05:15.724 --> 05:17.692
You can make a lot of cabbage
betting on K-ball.

05:17.726 --> 05:19.828
And that's what we'll end
the story with.

05:19.862 --> 05:21.629
No!

05:21.664 --> 05:22.964
This is Kent Brockman.

05:22.998 --> 05:25.133
Pleased with himself.

05:25.167 --> 05:27.035
♪ You only

05:27.069 --> 05:30.405
♪ Live once

05:30.439 --> 05:32.473
♪ Or so it seems

05:34.977 --> 05:37.979
♪ No life for yourself

05:38.013 --> 05:42.417
♪ And none for your dreams

05:44.086 --> 05:45.753
♪ You work

05:45.788 --> 05:48.723
♪ Every day

05:48.757 --> 05:54.195
♪ At a job so lame

05:54.230 --> 05:57.131
♪ And every night

05:57.166 --> 06:01.035
♪ The ending's the same.

06:01.070 --> 06:04.239
♪ No dream will come true

06:04.273 --> 06:05.406
♪ You only

06:05.441 --> 06:09.844
♪ Live once.

06:19.088 --> 06:21.890
Yeah, well, at least you
got your health, huh?

06:21.924 --> 06:24.092
Now let's see if I can
take that away from you.

06:24.126 --> 06:26.661
Your poison.

06:26.695 --> 06:29.797
I'm tired of living once.

06:29.832 --> 06:31.466
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

06:31.500 --> 06:34.269
but I'm starting to
regret saying "YOLO."

06:34.303 --> 06:36.504
Marge, if you don't mind,
I'm gonna quit complaining

06:36.538 --> 06:40.141
about my life and start
wallowing in the past.

06:40.175 --> 06:42.610
Postage, marked in pesetas?

06:42.645 --> 06:44.045
Who are those letters from?

06:44.079 --> 06:45.980
My old pen pal from Spain.

06:46.015 --> 06:47.615
Eduardo.
Hmm.

06:47.650 --> 06:49.017
Back in fifth grade,
you either had to write

06:49.051 --> 06:50.885
to a foreigner
or a prisoner.

06:50.920 --> 06:52.320
I picked a foreigner
because the prisoners

06:52.354 --> 06:54.255
wrote back too fast.

06:54.290 --> 06:57.492
We'd write each other
with our dreams of the future.

06:57.526 --> 06:59.794
I was gonna be
King of Cheeseburger Mountain.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.298
Did I change or did they stop

07:03.332 --> 07:05.700
making mountains
out of cheeseburgers?

07:05.734 --> 07:08.469
Probably a little bit of both.

07:08.504 --> 07:10.905
So sad.

07:17.780 --> 07:19.614
What kind of moral example

07:19.648 --> 07:22.383
is this dump for my boy?

07:24.987 --> 07:26.788
Please, calm down, everyone.

07:26.822 --> 07:28.856
You know, maybe
this so-called cheating scandal

07:28.891 --> 07:31.292
is actually
an opportunity to, uh...

07:31.327 --> 07:34.128
...initiate a-a dialogue

07:34.163 --> 07:37.298
that would, uh, create
a teachable moment.

07:37.333 --> 07:41.202
Uh, something, something
buzz word...

07:41.236 --> 07:43.404
I got nothing.

07:43.439 --> 07:45.373
Quick, get a picture
for the yearbook!

07:46.508 --> 07:48.943
I have a solution!

07:48.978 --> 07:52.146
You took your sweet time
coming to our rescue, Lisa.

07:52.181 --> 07:54.182
Maybe the best way to keep
students from cheating

07:54.216 --> 07:56.651
is to trust them not to cheat.

07:58.320 --> 07:59.654
That's it?
That's all you've got?

07:59.688 --> 08:01.856
Something I can read
on a tea box?

08:01.890 --> 08:05.526
What I'm suggesting is
we create an honor code.

08:05.561 --> 08:07.962
Oh, swell, more work
for the teachers.

08:07.997 --> 08:09.397
The students would do it.

08:09.431 --> 08:10.898
Let her speak!

08:10.933 --> 08:13.534
If every student pledges
not to cheat,

08:13.569 --> 08:15.937
and to turn in any cheater,

08:15.971 --> 08:17.505
no one will cheat the system

08:17.539 --> 08:20.274
because they'll be the system.

08:20.309 --> 08:23.878
Honor code! Honor code!

08:23.912 --> 08:25.947
I did it.

08:25.981 --> 08:27.315
I saved the day.

08:27.349 --> 08:29.684
The same way I won
that battle in Vietnam.

08:29.718 --> 08:30.818
By fainting!

08:32.788 --> 08:35.188
If you're my wife's
secret lover, come in.

08:35.224 --> 08:37.625
There's nothing
I can do for her anymore.

08:37.659 --> 08:39.659
I am looking
for my <i>amigo de la pluma.</i>

08:39.695 --> 08:41.261
Or "pen pal."

08:41.296 --> 08:42.897
Eduardo?

08:42.931 --> 08:43.965
Is it really you?

08:43.999 --> 08:45.533
Why are you here?

08:45.567 --> 08:47.769
To save the soul
of Homer Simpson.

08:47.803 --> 08:49.604
Now where is he, old man?

08:49.638 --> 08:51.305
I'm Homer Simpson!

08:51.340 --> 08:52.407
<i>Ay, dios mio!</i>

08:52.441 --> 08:53.508
What has happened to you?

08:55.778 --> 08:57.578
Did your hair burn
off in a fire

08:57.613 --> 08:58.913
that trapped you
in a candy factory?

08:58.947 --> 09:00.882
I wish.

09:07.067 --> 09:08.601
Marge Simpson.

09:08.636 --> 09:10.003
It's so nice
to meet a friend

09:10.037 --> 09:12.539
Homer met through the mail
who isn't a sea monkey.

09:12.573 --> 09:14.574
Yes, Eduardo Barcelona.

09:14.608 --> 09:17.043
Or in English, Eddie Miami.
Homie,

09:17.077 --> 09:18.611
I thought a visit
from your old pen pal

09:18.646 --> 09:20.046
would cheer you up.

09:20.080 --> 09:22.215
Ah, how eagerly
I would wait for a letter

09:22.249 --> 09:25.552
from the <i>EstadosUnidos,</i>
and Homer Simpson.

09:27.454 --> 09:29.188
"Buenos días, Eduardo."

09:34.461 --> 09:36.763
What happened
to us, Eduardo?

09:36.797 --> 09:39.632
We had so many things
we were going to do.

09:39.667 --> 09:41.935
And I, my friend,
have been doing them.

09:41.969 --> 09:43.169
Yeah, well, listen, pal.

09:43.203 --> 09:44.837
I have my treasure--

09:44.872 --> 09:46.839
my wife and my children.

09:46.874 --> 09:48.608
Ooh!

09:48.642 --> 09:49.642
I've had eight wives

09:49.677 --> 09:51.277
and 200 children!

09:51.312 --> 09:54.714
Among them artists, doctors
and revolutionary chefs.

09:54.748 --> 09:56.316
Do you have a
disrespectful son

09:56.350 --> 09:58.051
who calls you by
your first name?

09:58.085 --> 10:00.286
I cannot imagine
such a creature.

10:00.321 --> 10:02.088
Hey, Homer.
Did you just fart?

10:02.122 --> 10:04.424
Did you
just fart, <i>sir.</i>

10:04.458 --> 10:05.425
Whatever.

10:05.459 --> 10:06.893
Easy, easy, Homer.

10:06.927 --> 10:10.263
I want to help you fulfill
some of your childhood dreams.

10:10.297 --> 10:11.931
Really? Now?

10:11.966 --> 10:13.933
I have two pizzas coming.

10:13.968 --> 10:15.969
I wanted to see who
would get here first.

10:16.003 --> 10:17.103
Now, Homer!

10:17.137 --> 10:18.271
Get your coat.

10:18.305 --> 10:20.106
I asked him here
to cheer you up.

10:20.140 --> 10:21.474
But I didn't think
you'd drop everything

10:21.508 --> 10:22.976
to go gallivanting

10:23.010 --> 10:25.445
with some, no offense, Spaniard.

10:26.313 --> 10:27.914
I promise you
one thing, madam.

10:27.948 --> 10:30.249
When I return your husband,
he will be happy,

10:30.284 --> 10:33.453
bringing a new sense
of adventure to your marriage...

10:33.487 --> 10:35.355
and to the bedroom.

10:35.389 --> 10:37.857
I'm not used to strange men

10:37.891 --> 10:40.059
saying the word
"bedroom" around me.

10:40.094 --> 10:42.295
Would you prefer, uh,
<i>"sala deamor"?</i>

10:42.329 --> 10:43.930
That's even worse.

10:43.964 --> 10:45.298
Could you say it
one more time?

10:45.332 --> 10:46.432
<i>Sala de amor.</i>

10:46.467 --> 10:49.135
Ooh!

10:50.504 --> 10:51.571
Hello, children.

10:51.605 --> 10:53.606
I hold before you a copy

10:53.641 --> 10:55.742
of the school's new honor code.

10:56.777 --> 10:57.844
I know if I can get

10:57.878 --> 11:00.013
the toughest kid in class
to sign it,

11:00.047 --> 11:01.514
the rest of you will sign it.

11:01.548 --> 11:02.582
Milhouse?

11:06.253 --> 11:08.421
He's not the toughest kid, I am!

11:08.455 --> 11:10.490
Mm-hmm!

11:10.524 --> 11:12.325
Now, the smartest kid.

11:12.359 --> 11:13.960
Milhouse?

11:13.994 --> 11:15.662
He's not the smartest kid.

11:15.696 --> 11:18.631
I am.

11:18.666 --> 11:21.501
Now the class nerd.

11:21.535 --> 11:24.170
Milhouse?

11:24.204 --> 11:26.205
Oh.

11:31.078 --> 11:33.246
Homer, are you prepared
to achieve the dreams

11:33.280 --> 11:34.681
of a ten year old?

11:34.715 --> 11:37.617
I took the liberty of crossing
off the, uh, stupid ones.

11:40.087 --> 11:42.588
Now, this book
of your childhood drawings

11:42.623 --> 11:44.090
will come to life.

11:44.124 --> 11:46.192
Why are you doing this?

11:46.226 --> 11:48.628
Wait, are you in love with me?

11:48.662 --> 11:51.164
In love
with the concept of you, yes.

11:51.198 --> 11:54.934
Woo-hoo! I'm an attractive
concept like Liberty!

12:01.241 --> 12:02.975
One more ride?

12:03.010 --> 12:04.510
All right.

12:04.545 --> 12:06.713
Don't forget to ring the bell.

12:12.352 --> 12:13.853
I'm sick of pirates

12:13.887 --> 12:16.189
off the street ruining my play!

12:16.223 --> 12:19.659
I'm going back to my old career!

12:19.693 --> 12:21.094
Care to see a dessert menu?

12:21.128 --> 12:24.030
We have the best cobbler
since Daniel Day-Lewis.

12:29.136 --> 12:31.604
How much did this
cost to restage?

12:31.638 --> 12:34.874
They rented everything from
Comic Book Guy for ten bucks.

12:36.143 --> 12:37.877
Don't stink up
the Gorn head.

12:37.911 --> 12:40.747
I need it
for a Bar Mitzvah later.

12:42.082 --> 12:44.417
Now don't forget,
this is the first exam

12:44.451 --> 12:45.818
under the new honor code.

12:45.853 --> 12:47.153
They're doing it.

12:47.187 --> 12:48.454
They're self-proctoring.

12:48.489 --> 12:50.790
Can't you say anything
in a normal way?

12:50.824 --> 12:53.893
The answer, sadly,
is not yes.

12:55.262 --> 12:57.163
I don't know what it is

12:57.197 --> 12:58.731
about having
all my dreams fulfilled,

12:58.766 --> 13:00.633
but I feel great!

13:00.667 --> 13:02.902
Oh, if you're
happy I'm happy.

13:02.936 --> 13:03.903
What?

13:03.937 --> 13:05.304
That doesn't sound happy.

13:05.339 --> 13:07.640
I feel kind of, oh...

13:07.674 --> 13:09.575
melancholy.

13:09.610 --> 13:11.878
Mmm, melon collie.

13:13.547 --> 13:15.148
That's not helping.

13:15.182 --> 13:17.550
Well, what was
your childhood dream?

13:17.584 --> 13:19.185
Jumping on the bed.

13:19.219 --> 13:21.220
But I never disobeyed
my parents.

13:21.255 --> 13:22.388
Till I married you.

13:22.422 --> 13:24.190
Let's do it.

13:24.224 --> 13:26.359
Oh, I'm a little tired.

13:26.393 --> 13:28.127
Could we just snuggle again?

13:28.162 --> 13:29.595
We do that every night!

13:29.630 --> 13:30.630
Come on!

13:30.664 --> 13:31.998
Jump on the bed!

13:33.133 --> 13:36.169
Ooh, okay!

13:38.138 --> 13:39.505
Can I help you, stranger?

13:39.540 --> 13:41.641
I am just watching
my friend and his wife

13:41.675 --> 13:44.343
innocently pleasure
themselves in bed.

13:44.378 --> 13:45.511
That sounds salty,

13:45.546 --> 13:47.079
but you seem sweet.

13:47.114 --> 13:48.848
I'm gonna call you
Kettle Corn.

13:51.051 --> 13:54.787
Eduardo, I haven't felt
this good in years.

13:54.822 --> 13:56.823
You're like the Tooth Fairy.

13:56.857 --> 13:59.525
Except you don't collect
human bones.

13:59.560 --> 14:02.428
Yes, yes. Of course I don't.

14:02.462 --> 14:03.629
Here.

14:03.664 --> 14:04.730
So, that's it?

14:04.765 --> 14:07.300
All my dreams, lived?

14:07.334 --> 14:09.035
Eh... all but one.

14:09.069 --> 14:10.169
Well, we've got to do it!

14:10.204 --> 14:12.205
I never leave
a job unfinished.

14:12.239 --> 14:13.973
It's as true now as that week

14:14.007 --> 14:15.741
I worked
on the high school yearbook.

14:15.776 --> 14:17.210
So much infighting.

14:17.244 --> 14:18.744
I had to get out of there.

14:18.779 --> 14:21.547
All right, Homer,
we shall do this thing.

14:21.582 --> 14:24.016
The editor put in
like six pictures of this girl

14:24.051 --> 14:26.385
'cause she was his girlfriend.

14:26.420 --> 14:28.120
Everyone has a
bad yearbook story.

14:28.155 --> 14:29.188
They spelled my name wrong!

14:29.223 --> 14:30.289
Get over it! Ha!

14:30.324 --> 14:31.324
D'oh!

14:34.228 --> 14:36.128
So don't do what I did.

14:36.163 --> 14:38.431
That concludes our safety video.

14:40.167 --> 14:42.401
Just step out that door

14:42.436 --> 14:44.337
and you can glide to earth

14:44.371 --> 14:45.872
like your boyhood hero...

14:45.906 --> 14:48.641
Rocky the Flying Squirrel.

14:49.843 --> 14:51.711
Uh, actually,
my hero

14:51.745 --> 14:54.146
was the actress
who provided Rocky's voice,

14:54.181 --> 14:55.948
June Foray.

14:55.983 --> 14:58.351
A true legend
in the voice-over community.

14:58.385 --> 15:00.253
I'm just gonna stay on the plane

15:00.287 --> 15:01.854
and think about her influence.

15:01.889 --> 15:03.222
She has lived her life.

15:03.257 --> 15:04.690
Now, you must live yours.

15:04.725 --> 15:05.725
No!

15:05.759 --> 15:06.759
Do not worry!

15:06.793 --> 15:08.628
I will follow
the trail of your fear!

15:09.696 --> 15:11.163
<i>Will Homer make it?</i>

15:11.198 --> 15:13.132
<i>Or will he leave</i>
<i>a crater the size</i>

15:13.166 --> 15:15.368
<i>of the one</i>
<i>that destroyed the Yucatan?</i>

15:15.402 --> 15:18.070
<i>Find out in our next</i>
<i>exciting installment:</i>

15:18.105 --> 15:19.405
Fat Splat...

15:19.439 --> 15:21.908
<i>or</i> When You Squish
Upon a Car.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.527
Mmm, it's amazing.

15:28.561 --> 15:32.164
Every day has the peace
and serenity of a flu outbreak.

15:32.198 --> 15:35.467
Guess I'll be getting
some extra credit for this.

15:35.501 --> 15:37.235
Lisa, I'm afraid you've gotten

15:37.270 --> 15:38.637
all the extra credit
we can give out.

15:38.671 --> 15:41.173
So Willie has been
growing you a nice pumpkin.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.674
Here it is, lass.

15:42.709 --> 15:45.844
You want me to carve it
into a thank-o'-lantern?

15:45.878 --> 15:47.012
No, this is good.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.984
Well, this knife's got
to carve something.

15:57.323 --> 15:58.290
Homer!

15:59.993 --> 16:01.493
You don't have to flap.

16:01.527 --> 16:03.595
Just glide on the wind.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.731
Uh, okay.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.699
Flap! Flap! Flap!
Flap! Flap! Flap!

16:10.136 --> 16:12.871
Yes, good,
much better.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.679
I got Bart's backpack.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.815
He got a hundred on his test?

16:23.850 --> 16:25.851
That's impossible.

16:28.755 --> 16:31.189
Is Bart cheating?

16:31.224 --> 16:32.858
Are the Pope's tweets
infallible?

16:34.894 --> 16:36.328
Bart, I'm gonna tell!

16:36.362 --> 16:37.396
No, you're not.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.164
Because if you tell people
I cheated,

16:39.198 --> 16:40.665
that means your system failed.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.934
Oh, my God,
you found a loophole!

16:42.969 --> 16:46.238
Why don't you put this much
inventiveness into your work?

16:46.272 --> 16:48.440
Because then I'd be the one
thing I swore I wouldn't.

16:48.474 --> 16:49.608
You.

16:54.547 --> 16:56.848
I'm doing it!

16:56.883 --> 16:58.517
I'm flying like the squirrel

16:58.551 --> 17:00.919
I always knew I was.

17:02.422 --> 17:05.257
Ooh, indigo!

17:05.290 --> 17:07.192
Homer?

17:07.226 --> 17:09.594
It's me,
talking in your earphone.

17:09.628 --> 17:11.262
Come down, Homie.

17:11.297 --> 17:12.631
"You only live once"

17:12.665 --> 17:16.268
also means when you die,
you die!

17:19.405 --> 17:20.372
What's going on?

17:20.406 --> 17:21.640
Hello?

17:21.674 --> 17:22.707
Hmm?

17:22.742 --> 17:23.708
Hmm? Hmm?

17:23.742 --> 17:25.109
Are you mocking me?

17:25.144 --> 17:27.079
You can listen to your
wife when you are dead.

17:27.113 --> 17:28.780
Savor the moment.

17:50.103 --> 17:52.437
Majestic eagle.

17:52.472 --> 17:56.308
Just like me,
unashamed of his baldness.

17:57.677 --> 17:59.644
So beautiful.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.413
Aw, he probably sees a mouse

18:01.447 --> 18:03.148
he wants to tear in half.

18:04.183 --> 18:05.584
D'oh!

18:05.618 --> 18:08.653
Stupid tallest building
in Springfield!

18:15.862 --> 18:16.895
Hmm...

18:22.468 --> 18:24.136
Ha!
Whoa!

18:24.170 --> 18:27.038
You've presented me
with quite a conundrum.

18:27.073 --> 18:28.240
A word you should know

18:28.274 --> 18:31.476
since it was on a
vocabulary test you aced.

18:32.745 --> 18:36.548
But after some thought,
all my worries went away.

18:36.582 --> 18:38.150
I know the answer.

18:38.184 --> 18:41.486
I'm gonna force you
to turn yourself in.

18:41.521 --> 18:42.587
Good luck with that.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.822
The only thing that'll change
my mind

18:43.856 --> 18:45.857
is a sign from God.

18:49.595 --> 18:52.397
Son, it was so beautiful!

18:52.431 --> 18:55.700
I went faster
than the speed of sound.

19:00.373 --> 19:01.740
Well, Bart, is that enough

19:01.774 --> 19:03.441
of a sign for you?

19:03.476 --> 19:05.710
All right, I'll turn myself in.

19:05.745 --> 19:07.445
It'll give me a chance
to work some more

19:07.480 --> 19:09.214
on the detention quilt.

19:13.519 --> 19:15.487
This patch is
for all the victims

19:15.521 --> 19:18.323
of atomic wedgies.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.726
My friend,
you've lived your dreams.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.629
No matter what,
Homer Simpson has done it.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.966
And soon I hope I remember
who Homer Simpson is

19:28.000 --> 19:30.168
and his relationship to me.

19:30.203 --> 19:31.703
But I have no regrets.

19:31.737 --> 19:35.073
In fact, all this
has given me a sense of calm

19:35.107 --> 19:37.909
I've never had before.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.411
That's the morphine.

19:39.445 --> 19:41.913
Can you give me the
morphine forever?

19:41.948 --> 19:42.914
No way!

19:42.949 --> 19:44.282
A person on morphine
all the time

19:44.317 --> 19:46.318
would constantly dissolve
in inappropriate laughter.

19:55.924 --> 19:57.725
Eduardo? Eduardo! Eduardo!

20:00.362 --> 20:01.462
Oh.

20:01.496 --> 20:03.597
It was all just a dream.

20:03.631 --> 20:05.232
It was not just a dream.

20:05.266 --> 20:07.234
And you said you'd drive me
to the airport.

20:07.268 --> 20:08.569
Oh, yeah.

20:08.603 --> 20:09.670
Great.

20:09.704 --> 20:11.138
Um...

20:11.172 --> 20:12.373
Do I drop you at the curb

20:12.407 --> 20:14.341
or do I have to park
and walk you in?

20:14.376 --> 20:17.244
Go as far as your heart
will take you.

20:19.114 --> 20:21.081
You are a good friend.
