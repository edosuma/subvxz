he's the one that killed Colin Rutger.

01:40.760 --> 01:43.389
That's him. Says he can produce

he's happily married.

over gambling debts,

for our guns and badges.

- Exactly.
- That's right.

03:50.670 --> 03:52.020
OK. So what do we do?

03:52.110 --> 03:54.479
Well, we can't let a murderer
walk out on the streets while

03:54.480 --> 03:56.240

03:56.270 --> 03:57.329
No. I think we should start

03:57.330 --> 03:59.539
by talking to his wife and see
if she has any idea

03:59.540 --> 04:01.219
why her husband would take
the fall for this.

04:01.220 --> 04:02.660

is to get Logan next to Morrow.

this is a good idea.

a cell block with.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.829

Why do I have the sudden urge to flee?

05:32.950 --> 05:34.410

06:09.620 --> 06:11.049

- you need out immediately.
- OK.

I guess we're roommates, huh?

09:37.880 --> 09:39.411
My name's Tom Critchley.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.814
<i>Just... stay calm.</i>

09:40.815 --> 09:43.874
<i>Don't say anything.
Just stay calm.</i>

09:44.110 --> 09:47.400
Well, I got nabbed jackin' a Portia,
couldn't make my bail.

09:48.510 --> 09:51.153
<i>Don't talk. Head down.</i>

09:51.780 --> 09:53.690
Guess you're not the talkative type, huh?

09:53.830 --> 09:56.670
Hey, fish! You got me in bad
with the guard!

09:57.707 --> 10:01.040
Look man, it's not going to be easy
in here, you know that?

10:01.050 --> 10:02.660
These guys don't fool around.

10:03.327 --> 10:05.002
We're gonna have to stick together.

10:06.110 --> 10:09.170
Look... I'm not looking to make friends.

10:09.480 --> 10:13.049
Or enemies. Just want to keep
my head down, do my time.

10:13.050 --> 10:15.439
Sure. You're gonna need
a friend though, man.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.019
You got no problem making enemies.

10:17.020 --> 10:19.230
Hey fish! I'm talking to you!

10:19.950 --> 10:22.750
I don't like being ignored, fish.
It's disrespectful.

10:23.800 --> 10:27.015
And getting dissed makes me cranky.
Fish, you don't want me when I'm cranky!

10:27.045 --> 10:28.613
You hear me, fish?!

10:38.620 --> 10:41.200
- You hear anything from Toby?
- Uh, nothing yet.

10:41.230 --> 10:42.459
Takes a while to get through processing.

10:42.460 --> 10:44.099
Might be a couple hours before
we hear from him.

10:44.100 --> 10:45.799
We managed to track down Morrow's wife.

10:45.800 --> 10:47.469
Asked her to make a statement,
she's in the conference room.

10:47.499 --> 10:48.127
Maybe she knows why

10:48.157 --> 10:49.980
- her husband took the fall.
- Yeah.

10:52.460 --> 10:54.660
Jeremy never hurt a soul in his life.

10:55.380 --> 10:56.669
I have no idea how this happened.

10:56.670 --> 10:58.599
He didn't tell me anything.

10:58.970 --> 11:02.473
Your husband says that killed Rutger
over gambling debt.

11:03.110 --> 11:05.700
Did he have a problem
with gambling in the past?

11:05.740 --> 11:09.600
Years ago. But he went
to a twelve-step program.

11:10.551 --> 11:12.280
I thought those days were behind us.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.140
But?

11:17.160 --> 11:20.574
I didn't realize it at the time,
but there were signs.

11:20.928 --> 11:22.629
He was falling back into his old ways.

11:22.630 --> 11:24.600
Collection agencies started calling.

11:25.090 --> 11:26.620
He'd leave in the middle of the night.

11:26.910 --> 11:29.050
Yeah. Things started missing
from your house?

11:29.060 --> 11:30.730
Heirlooms? Jewelry?

11:33.230 --> 11:36.180
Your husband had no history
of violence, ma'am.

11:36.220 --> 11:37.629
But he did owe money all over town,

11:37.630 --> 11:40.269
it's possible that he owed money
to Sean Boorman.

11:40.270 --> 11:41.219
I never heard of Sean Boorman

11:41.220 --> 11:43.010
until my husband showed up in court.

11:43.480 --> 11:46.150
Well, we believe that the two of the them
had an agreement.

11:46.420 --> 11:48.559
Boorman would take care
of your husband's debt

11:48.560 --> 11:52.339
if your husband would take the fall
for the murder of Rutger.

11:52.601 --> 11:54.122
All I know is

11:54.952 --> 11:57.049
my husband is going away

11:57.079 --> 11:59.360
for a very, very long time

11:59.780 --> 12:01.329
and he's left me with a mountain of debt.

12:01.330 --> 12:03.630
I have no idea what I'm going to do.

12:05.056 --> 12:05.842
Alright.

12:05.872 --> 12:07.210
(Phone ringing)

12:07.240 --> 12:08.934
Let's get Dev to check
into Morrow's financials,

12:08.964 --> 12:10.026
see if the wife was lying.

12:10.056 --> 12:12.009
Alright, I'll check on the connections
between Morrow,

12:12.010 --> 12:14.019
Rutger and Boorman as well.

12:14.020 --> 12:15.164
Great.

12:16.410 --> 12:18.069
How long are we going
to keep Toby in there?

12:18.070 --> 12:19.614
Long as it takes.

12:20.530 --> 12:23.530
He's got his cover. He's studied
his backgrounds.

12:24.050 --> 12:26.000
I'm confident that he'll be
alright in there.

12:26.540 --> 12:27.879
You know it wasn't that long ago
you were saying

12:27.880 --> 12:29.665
that he was a liability.

12:31.550 --> 12:34.571
Gotta trust someone, right?
Might as well be your team.

12:40.100 --> 12:42.971
There.
Hey, Fish.

12:43.001 --> 12:43.806
Come over here,

12:43.836 --> 12:46.080
- I want to show you something.
- Come on.

12:47.190 --> 12:49.229
Hey guys, I think fishy
and his friend don't like us

12:49.230 --> 12:52.180
very much. And I know we're
a likeable bunch of guys.

12:52.210 --> 12:53.940
I think you're right, Vince.

12:54.180 --> 12:56.770
Maybe these guys, they just need
to get to know us better.

12:58.450 --> 13:01.310
- Afternoon, ladies.
- Good afternoon.

13:01.540 --> 13:03.910
That's the guy that killed
that bookie, Rutger.

13:06.230 --> 13:10.770
So. Fishy's a stone-cold murderer.

13:11.090 --> 13:13.239
I'm impressed. Tell me all about it,

13:13.269 --> 13:15.216
tell me how you did that guy, fishy.

13:16.484 --> 13:18.160
- Ah!
- You speak when spoken to, fishy!

13:18.190 --> 13:19.357
Didn't nobody never teach you that, huh?

13:19.387 --> 13:20.894
Let's take it... let's take it easy.

13:23.080 --> 13:26.410
Well, look at that.
Look at what we got here.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.960
Fishy's little friend has got a pair.

13:28.990 --> 13:29.700
(Grins)

13:29.730 --> 13:31.051
We're not looking for any trouble.

13:31.480 --> 13:33.419
Yeah, but trouble found you, didn't it?

13:33.420 --> 13:35.369
Let me go or I'll call a guard.

13:35.370 --> 13:36.724
What'd you say?!

13:37.020 --> 13:39.539
Try calling for a guard now when
you don't have no air to breathe.

13:39.540 --> 13:40.720
It's Vince, right? Vince?

13:40.730 --> 13:41.909
I'll tell you who I am.

13:41.910 --> 13:43.659
Look, I think we got a mutual friend.

13:43.660 --> 13:45.740
You guys did a few big jobs together.

13:48.187 --> 13:49.996
<i>Get the rest of it! Go! Go!</i>

13:50.235 --> 13:52.220
Yeah, you guys bagged a ton of ice.

13:54.860 --> 13:56.681
<i>Move it, Mick. Let's go!</i>

13:57.590 --> 14:00.110
Mick couldn't stop talking about it.

14:00.670 --> 14:01.870
How you know Mick?

14:01.900 --> 14:04.220
<i>This guy in Mill Haven with him?</i>

14:04.498 --> 14:07.000
Well, we go back. Did a few things.

14:07.030 --> 14:08.580
It's a shame he's in Mill Haven.

14:08.590 --> 14:10.500
Yeah, you right about that.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.189
Look, my cellmate here, he's

14:14.190 --> 14:15.609
having a hard time breathing.

14:15.610 --> 14:17.149
Yeah, so what's your point?

14:17.150 --> 14:18.659
My point is he's not worth
the time, alright?

14:18.660 --> 14:20.330
Look at him, he's just a punk.

14:20.730 --> 14:22.920
(Inmate): Come on already!
Take him out, take him out!

14:23.439 --> 14:25.382
(Exhaling) Agh!

14:25.920 --> 14:27.809
Next time you talk about calling a guard,

14:27.810 --> 14:29.706
you'll be breathing blood.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.330
This was fun, ladies.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.592
Let's do it again sometime.

14:38.100 --> 14:40.250
Ooh, they lucky buddy came out!

14:41.650 --> 14:44.191
Man, fish better watch his back.

14:51.294 --> 14:53.038
(Buzz!)

15:05.780 --> 15:07.319
Guess I owe you a thanks, huh?

15:07.320 --> 15:08.758
Oh yeah? Why?

15:09.060 --> 15:10.830
Stepping up for me back there.

15:11.910 --> 15:13.239
Other guys wouldn't bother.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.859
Oh, man. Honestly
if Vince had killed you

15:15.860 --> 15:19.110
I was worried that my new cellmate
would be worse than you.

15:21.410 --> 15:23.010
What kind of music you got there?

15:23.630 --> 15:25.590
No music. Audiobooks.

15:25.930 --> 15:27.340
Oh yeah, audiobooks.

15:27.370 --> 15:28.610
What'd you got on it?

15:28.861 --> 15:31.211
A book on how to bust us out of here?

15:32.880 --> 15:34.980
Look, you don't want to bust out
of here, do you?

15:37.190 --> 15:38.230
What're you talking about?

15:38.240 --> 15:40.210
Look, I'm just saying you know.

15:40.240 --> 15:42.059
You put yourself here,
it was your choice,

15:42.060 --> 15:43.439
not like the rest of us.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.890
<i>This wasn't a choice.</i>

15:46.250 --> 15:48.729
Yeah, I don't know man.
There's nothing in the world

15:48.730 --> 15:50.430
that could make me do what you did.

15:51.650 --> 15:54.569
<i>You're going to be
a good little boy scout</i>

15:54.570 --> 15:56.700
<i>and honour the deal.</i>

15:57.730 --> 15:59.730
You must've had a good reason.

16:02.430 --> 16:04.120
You know why I confessed to murder?

16:05.210 --> 16:06.560
Because I did it.

16:07.090 --> 16:09.770
I shot him dead and
I'd do it again, too.

16:11.050 --> 16:13.402
So why don't you just shut
the hell up about it?

16:28.000 --> 16:28.740
(Phone rings)

16:28.770 --> 16:29.800
Thanks.

16:29.935 --> 16:32.242
(Beep! Beep! Beep!)

16:32.300 --> 16:33.920
Michelle, Toby just sent me a message

16:33.930 --> 16:35.799
through his transponder.
He's got intel.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.409
OK, I guess we're going to have
to send you in there.

16:37.410 --> 16:38.429
Alright, I can go right now.

16:38.430 --> 16:39.789
No, let's wait 'til morning.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.809
It'll be too suspicious if you go now.

16:41.810 --> 16:43.109
- You sure?
- Yeah,

16:43.110 --> 16:45.010
I was just hoping he wouldn't have
to spend the night in there.

16:45.020 --> 16:46.089
He's got his transponder.

16:46.090 --> 16:47.560
If he needs to get out then he can.

16:48.251 --> 16:50.011
How are you doing on the
Morrows' financials?

16:50.041 --> 16:51.859
- You've been looking into it, right?
- I have. Yeah.

16:51.860 --> 16:53.909
But between a line of credit,

16:53.910 --> 16:56.099
5 years' back taxes and 7 credit cards,

16:56.100 --> 16:57.179
they owe hundreds of thousands.

16:57.180 --> 16:59.799
Their financial picture is a horror show.

16:59.800 --> 17:00.709
OK, so you would say

17:00.710 --> 17:02.799
that Morrow was motivated
to take a payoff.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.118
Extremely. But if there was
some sort of payoff,

17:05.119 --> 17:07.450
there's no obvious signs of it.

17:07.660 --> 17:11.019
OK, well. No. Maybe he found
a clever way to hide his money.

17:11.020 --> 17:13.719
Yeah, but let's not forget I'm
a forensic accounting ninja, OK?

17:13.720 --> 17:15.470
If there was a payoff between
Boorman and Morrow,

17:15.480 --> 17:17.579
- I would have found it.
- That's true.

17:18.339 --> 17:19.980
Maybe it's not about the money at all.

17:20.390 --> 17:21.470
Then what's it about?

17:32.930 --> 17:34.329
(Guard): Lights out!

17:39.230 --> 17:40.598
(Toby sighs)

17:56.523 --> 17:58.536
(Buzz!)

18:01.760 --> 18:02.989
Fifteen minutes, Councillor.

18:02.990 --> 18:04.292
I have some very important issues

18:04.322 --> 18:05.609
I have to discuss with my client.

18:05.610 --> 18:06.750
Fifteen minutes.

18:08.490 --> 18:11.379
Hey. Don't take it personally,
he's like that with everyone.

18:11.380 --> 18:13.847
Nice hair, by the way.

18:14.120 --> 18:16.599
- How's it going in here?
- Morrow's a tough nut to crack.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.519
Look, I think I need a little more time

18:18.520 --> 18:21.259
which I'm not so sure he has a lot of.

18:21.260 --> 18:23.730
- What do you mean?
- He's marked.

18:23.780 --> 18:25.821
We're going to have to move fast.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.588
What about you? Are you ok?

18:28.770 --> 18:29.809
Have you run into any trouble

18:29.810 --> 18:31.570
- with any of the prison...
- Nothing I can't handle.

18:32.980 --> 18:34.329
What're you not telling me?

18:34.330 --> 18:36.319
Look, I finally got Morrow talking about

18:36.320 --> 18:38.009
the murder last night and

18:38.010 --> 18:39.661
I got a read of him being threatened

18:39.691 --> 18:42.130
by someone to honour the deal.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.380
Honour the deal...

18:43.430 --> 18:44.409
Do you know who it was?

18:44.410 --> 18:46.980
No. I think it might've
been an enforcer

18:46.990 --> 18:48.489
working for Boorman maybe.

18:48.490 --> 18:50.739
OK, well we need to connect
this enforcer back to Boorman.

18:50.740 --> 18:52.159
Right, I got a face.

18:52.160 --> 18:53.859
We got about uh, 14 minutes,

18:53.860 --> 18:55.730
so let's uh, hurry.

18:59.435 --> 19:02.016
♪

19:03.840 --> 19:05.669
So this is the facial composite

19:05.670 --> 19:07.639
we made based on
Toby's read of Morrow.

19:07.640 --> 19:09.689
I ran it through the regular
facial recognition

19:09.690 --> 19:11.349
criminal databases.
Couldn't get anything,

19:11.350 --> 19:13.166
so I expanded my search
to other databases

19:13.196 --> 19:14.179
and I got a hit.

19:14.405 --> 19:17.400
This is none other than Lincoln Roth.

19:17.480 --> 19:20.000
No way. Lincoln "The Rocket" Roth.

19:20.430 --> 19:22.689
You know him? Have you
arrested him before?

19:22.690 --> 19:25.620
Man. Arrested him?
God, no. I was a fan!

19:25.630 --> 19:26.419
He's a boxer.

19:26.420 --> 19:28.409
He boxed in the '92 Barcelona Olympics.

19:28.410 --> 19:29.989
Oh God, he had the sweetest left hook.

19:29.990 --> 19:31.319
Should've medaled too.

19:31.320 --> 19:33.970
- Robbed by the judges.
- (Together): Russians.

19:34.430 --> 19:35.859
Anyway, after Barcelona,

19:35.860 --> 19:38.319
he decided to go pro
but had no better luck.

19:38.320 --> 19:39.900
After a string of heartbreaking losses

19:39.910 --> 19:43.039
he decided to hang up the gloves
and he opened up a gym.

19:43.040 --> 19:44.569
Uh, this is all super fascinating,

19:44.570 --> 19:46.199
but how is it connected to our case?

19:46.200 --> 19:48.319
Well, about 4 years ago, said gym

19:48.320 --> 19:51.780
went into some financial turmoil
and faced foreclosure.

19:51.790 --> 19:55.019
But after an injection of cash
from a silent partner,

19:55.020 --> 19:56.599
he was able to not only
keep the first gym,

19:56.600 --> 19:57.990
but open up a second one.

19:58.700 --> 20:01.119
One guess as to who
the silent investor was?

20:01.120 --> 20:02.889
- Boorman.
- That's what my sources say.

20:02.890 --> 20:05.229
And the same source says that
Roth has been working off

20:05.230 --> 20:07.769
his debts to Boorman
by doing his dirty work.

20:07.770 --> 20:10.234
Which would explain
why Logan saw Roth

20:10.264 --> 20:11.520
threatening Morrow.

20:11.550 --> 20:13.059
Dev, see if you can get Roth down here.

20:13.060 --> 20:14.730
- Yep, I'll call a unit.
- Yeah.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.000
Thanks, corporal.

20:16.300 --> 20:19.199
How long do you think it would take
to get a wiretap warrant?

20:19.200 --> 20:20.558
Not long, why?

20:20.800 --> 20:22.023
I have an idea.

20:23.980 --> 20:25.330
Sure, I heard of Morrow.

20:26.080 --> 20:27.650
Story was in the papers.

20:28.530 --> 20:30.230
He killed that guy. What was his name?

20:30.490 --> 20:33.009
- Rutger.
- Right. Rutger.

20:33.010 --> 20:35.020
Yeah, killed him over a game of cards
or something?

20:35.200 --> 20:36.849
I think you know a lot more
about this case

20:36.850 --> 20:38.489
than you're letting on, Mr. Roth.

20:38.490 --> 20:39.710
Call me Lincoln.

20:40.360 --> 20:43.140
It was your associate, Sean Boorman,
who killed him.

20:43.770 --> 20:44.819
Now we have reason to believe that

20:44.820 --> 20:46.479
you helped him and if that's the case,

20:46.480 --> 20:49.609
you're looking at 20 years
in prison, Lincoln.

20:49.610 --> 20:52.600
First, I don't know nothing
about that murder.

20:53.000 --> 20:57.699
And second, I'm no associate
or whatever of Boorman's.

20:57.700 --> 20:59.960
- You're saying you don't know him?
- I didn't say that.

21:02.080 --> 21:03.669
He goes to one of my gyms.

21:03.670 --> 21:06.540
I talk to him sometimes like I do
to all my clients.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.870
You know I used to watch you fight, Roth.

21:10.410 --> 21:11.889
What I loved about his style...

21:11.890 --> 21:14.440
well, you were just so smart in the ring.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.040
But you're not being smart right now,

21:18.170 --> 21:19.749
- you're being a knucklehead.
- Is that right?

21:19.750 --> 21:22.070
Yeah, yeah. Because we've got a witness

21:22.820 --> 21:24.550
who saw you threaten Morrow.

21:24.560 --> 21:27.600
You told Morrow to be
"A good little boy scout".

21:27.800 --> 21:29.447
"Honour the deal"?

21:29.970 --> 21:32.259
That's right. He leant you money, right?

21:32.260 --> 21:33.470
For your gym?

21:33.880 --> 21:36.610
What do you owe him?
200, 300 grand now?

21:36.840 --> 21:40.420
Even if I did take money
from Boorman, so what?

21:41.090 --> 21:43.420
Friends helping friends,
that ain't a crime.

21:43.550 --> 21:45.919
But just a second ago, you said
you barely knew Boorman

21:45.920 --> 21:47.970
and now all of a sudden
you're best friends?

21:49.840 --> 21:54.164
You got something solid on me,
you arrest me right now.

21:54.690 --> 21:56.882
You got nothing solid, then I'm walking.

21:56.912 --> 21:57.720
Mm.

22:00.630 --> 22:02.680
Well, I guess you're walking Rocket.

22:08.098 --> 22:09.653
Thanks for coming in.
Hey...

22:10.670 --> 22:12.510
You were robbed in Barcelona, man.

22:12.540 --> 22:15.629
Russian judges. What're you going to do?

22:15.630 --> 22:17.340
Yeah, what're you going to do?

22:31.940 --> 22:34.870
It's me. I'm leaving the IIB right now.

22:35.630 --> 22:36.880
Looks like you're right.

22:36.960 --> 22:39.140
Our friend on the inside must be talking.

22:39.510 --> 22:41.149
You got a leaky ship.

22:41.150 --> 22:42.419
You're gonna want to patch that up.

22:42.420 --> 22:43.569
Sounds like a message for Boorman

22:43.570 --> 22:45.129
warning him that Morrow's talking.

22:45.130 --> 22:46.949
We need to get this information to Toby.

22:46.950 --> 22:48.740
We may have just got this guy killed.

22:56.718 --> 22:58.103
(Clang! Clang! Clang!)

22:58.140 --> 22:59.940
Got a visitor, Chritchley.

23:02.787 --> 23:04.564
(Buzz!)

23:10.846 --> 23:12.898
(Buzz!)

23:21.670 --> 23:24.519
Admit the visitors for Critchley,
McManis, and Fowler.

23:24.520 --> 23:26.160
We need to talk about Morrow.

23:26.180 --> 23:27.700
We want to know what he's been up to.

23:28.750 --> 23:30.579
What do I look like, his babysitter?

23:30.580 --> 23:32.779
You're his cellmate, so you know
what he's been doing.

23:32.780 --> 23:35.240
More importantly, you know
what he's been saying.

23:35.250 --> 23:38.149
Alright look. He's not the most
talkative guy in the world.

23:38.150 --> 23:39.790
He hasn't said a word to me.

23:39.800 --> 23:43.100
How 'bout people on the outside?
Any visitors, phone calls?

23:43.590 --> 23:46.770
- Why do you care?
- Because I'm interested.

23:48.550 --> 23:51.030
<i>A friend on the outside needs
to know who he's talking to.</i>

23:51.080 --> 23:54.150
<i>- Sweat the cellmate.
- Alright.</i>

23:55.580 --> 23:56.919
OK. Yeah, I get it.

23:56.920 --> 23:59.540
You're the attack dog and you're
the one holding the leash.

24:00.760 --> 24:02.213
(Chuckles)

24:02.280 --> 24:05.050
Well, not as dumb as you look, Critchley.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.799
So, why're you so concerned
about my cellmate?

24:07.800 --> 24:09.670
Is someone curious on the outside?

24:11.280 --> 24:14.440
<i>I need you to keep your eyes
on someone for me.</i>

24:17.140 --> 24:18.989
Listen to me closely, Critchley. OK?

24:18.990 --> 24:20.679
There's a one-way flow of information.

24:20.680 --> 24:22.810
I ask and then you answer.

24:24.270 --> 24:25.749
- Are we clear?
- Crystal.

24:25.750 --> 24:29.267
Good. Now who was Morrow talking to?

24:29.335 --> 24:31.045
(Buzz!)

24:31.640 --> 24:33.899
Save the chit-chat for
the sewing circle, ladies.

24:33.900 --> 24:34.980
Break it up.

24:40.650 --> 24:42.529
'Sup babe? You look good.

24:42.559 --> 24:45.396
Thanks baby. I miss you.

24:45.426 --> 24:46.409
How you doing?

24:46.410 --> 24:48.840
I'm good, I'm good.
I'm saying out of trouble.

24:49.350 --> 24:50.854
So what's the word?

24:53.030 --> 24:54.310
Everything's good.

24:54.530 --> 24:55.915
<i>We found Boorman's enforcer.</i>

24:55.945 --> 24:57.219
<i>His name's Lincoln Roth.</i>

24:57.220 --> 24:58.949
<i>Let's call him Jake.</i>

24:58.950 --> 25:00.349
<i>We think he's connected to a prisoner</i>

25:00.350 --> 25:02.070
<i>in Foxley, but who?</i>

25:02.200 --> 25:03.600
So how's Jake doing?

25:03.680 --> 25:05.889
Is he still a fan of the Irish Whiskey?

25:05.890 --> 25:07.689
Hm! Of course.

25:07.690 --> 25:09.569
<i>Irish Whiskey. Irish names.</i>

25:09.570 --> 25:11.229
<i>OK. Study the files.</i>

25:11.230 --> 25:14.870
<i>Is it Boyle? O'Connor? McManis?</i>

25:14.900 --> 25:16.652
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

25:16.682 --> 25:17.863
Jake and his whiskey.

25:17.900 --> 25:19.613
They always had a strong connection.

25:19.643 --> 25:20.647
(Chuckles)

25:20.677 --> 25:22.332
That's great, baby.

25:22.930 --> 25:24.259
<i>Morrow's life might be in danger.</i>

25:24.260 --> 25:26.249
<i>I want to get you out before
there's bloodshed.</i>

25:26.250 --> 25:29.029
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't take me out so soon,

25:29.030 --> 25:30.560
I'm so close.

25:31.520 --> 25:33.470
Just a little bit longer, OK?

25:33.791 --> 25:35.244
Yeah. OK.

25:35.295 --> 25:37.564
Thanks for coming to see me.

25:37.594 --> 25:38.914
I miss you.

25:39.260 --> 25:41.030
I miss you too, baby.

25:41.410 --> 25:43.429
- You be good.
- Mm-hmm.

25:44.376 --> 25:45.257
(Sighs)

25:45.330 --> 25:46.580
That's my girl.

25:47.483 --> 25:49.978
♪

25:54.710 --> 25:56.522
(Buzz!)

26:00.179 --> 26:01.290
Stop!

26:17.588 --> 26:18.922
Move!

26:21.211 --> 26:23.015
(Buzz!)

26:27.836 --> 26:29.340
(Clank)

26:29.370 --> 26:32.099
Hey. Look. You don't want to talk,
that's cool man.

26:32.100 --> 26:33.629
But you gotta listen to me, alright?

26:33.630 --> 26:36.029
McManis has been asking
a lot of questions about you.

26:36.030 --> 26:39.880
- McManis? Um... glasses?
- That's right.

26:40.100 --> 26:42.960
Look, I think he's connected
to someone heavy on the outside.

26:43.282 --> 26:45.060
<i>So he's the inside man.</i>

26:46.490 --> 26:49.500
He seems to think that you've been
talking about the murder.

26:51.200 --> 26:52.559
I don't know what you're talking about.

26:52.560 --> 26:55.029
Come on, man. I know
you didn't kill Rutger,

26:55.030 --> 26:56.109
I can just tell by looking at you

26:56.110 --> 26:57.850
that you have never killed anybody.

26:58.420 --> 27:00.300
I said we're not talking about this.

27:00.530 --> 27:01.730
Why're you taking the fall
for these guys?

27:01.740 --> 27:03.100
What do they have on you?

27:03.290 --> 27:06.159
<i>Don't lose the only thing that matters.</i>

27:06.160 --> 27:09.690
Look, uh, just leave it alone, will ya?

27:10.140 --> 27:11.920
Whatever it is, it must be heavy.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.110
Did they threaten someone close to you?

27:14.170 --> 27:15.923
I said leave it!

27:17.440 --> 27:19.110
I haven't heard anything from anyone.

27:19.330 --> 27:20.629
Look, I'm sure if Toby's in trouble,

27:20.630 --> 27:21.710
somebody will call you.

27:21.720 --> 27:23.679
Well, that's it. Every time
my phone rings, I panic.

27:23.680 --> 27:24.409
What if it's Michelle

27:24.410 --> 27:25.520
calling to tell me something
has happened to him?

27:25.550 --> 27:27.519
Pfft. How are you not used
to this by now?

27:27.520 --> 27:29.740
Toby's in danger pretty much
every second of his life.

27:29.900 --> 27:31.000
Not helping.

27:31.090 --> 27:33.019
OK. If something were to happen to Toby

27:33.020 --> 27:36.259
which it won't, he has
a support system in place

27:36.260 --> 27:37.729
that springs into action in seconds,

27:37.730 --> 27:39.450
OK? He's going to be fine.

27:39.550 --> 27:41.610
Yeah. I hope you're right.

27:44.226 --> 27:45.601
(Phone rings)

27:45.687 --> 27:47.020
_

27:47.060 --> 27:48.310
Unknown caller.

27:50.110 --> 27:51.628
Answer it already.

27:54.070 --> 27:56.750
Hello? Hey.

27:57.250 --> 28:00.130
Yes. I would. When?

28:01.020 --> 28:03.860
OK, I'll text you with the details.
Bye-bye.

28:06.050 --> 28:07.800
Well? What was that?
Everything OK?

28:08.360 --> 28:11.630
Actually, there is... something else.

28:13.130 --> 28:15.260
Why am I getting that sudden urge
to flee again?

28:15.430 --> 28:16.300
It's that guy.

28:16.840 --> 28:19.529
The guy who called saying he has
information about Toby's mom.

28:19.530 --> 28:22.370
No. No. I am not getting involved again.

28:22.920 --> 28:25.119
OK. I... I get it. Yeah.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.019
- Good.
- 'Couse I...

28:27.020 --> 28:29.090
Yeah. OK. I won't bother you
about it again.

28:29.608 --> 28:30.907
(Exhales)

28:32.617 --> 28:34.029
Reverse psychology,
I can't believe that worked.

28:34.030 --> 28:35.539
OK, look. If Toby finds out...

28:35.569 --> 28:36.924
I'll say you resisted for days.

28:38.370 --> 28:40.220
Does that... mean you'll help?

28:41.643 --> 28:42.417
I'm only doing this

28:42.447 --> 28:44.399
because I don't want anything
to happen to you. OK?

28:44.400 --> 28:46.859
If Toby finds out that I knew
that you were up to something

28:46.860 --> 28:49.069
and I didn't do anything and
something happened to you,

28:49.070 --> 28:51.039
I would not be able to live with myself.

28:51.040 --> 28:52.110
You're a great friend, Oz.

28:52.140 --> 28:53.570
Yeah, I'm the best.

28:53.870 --> 28:56.070
Can't believe you ate
that so-called food.

28:56.500 --> 28:57.769
The food's not so bad.

28:57.770 --> 28:59.360
Now I know you're crazy.

29:04.470 --> 29:05.672
<i>Hey, Fish!</i>

29:07.640 --> 29:09.508
<i>Told you I'd get you.</i>

29:13.667 --> 29:14.982
Stay down.

29:15.443 --> 29:16.349
(Grunt!)

29:16.401 --> 29:19.221
- Hey! Hey!
- (Inmates yell excitedly)

29:19.440 --> 29:21.640
This is what you get
for breaking a deal.

29:22.310 --> 29:23.684
They're going to kill her.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.749
(Guard): Break it up!
Come on, let's go! Get back!

29:34.779 --> 29:36.790
Get off him!
Against the wall!

29:37.020 --> 29:39.320
- (Guard): Come on!
- Stand right there.

29:39.589 --> 29:42.750
- Hey! Don't you move!
- Go! Go! On the ground.

29:42.924 --> 29:43.920
I'll put you down.

29:43.950 --> 29:46.830
Get back to the wall!
Back to the wall, now!

29:51.140 --> 29:52.320
So Tia knows that you're out?

29:52.350 --> 29:53.559
Yeah, I gave her a call.

29:53.560 --> 29:56.919
Alright. You can't put this
all on yourself, Toby.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.779
Well look, it happened 'cause of me.
They went after him

29:58.780 --> 30:00.179
'cause they thought
he was talking to the cops.

30:00.180 --> 30:01.730
He never said a word.

30:02.920 --> 30:04.940
According to the medical report,

30:05.440 --> 30:07.570
Morrow has two cracked ribs
and suffered a concussion,

30:07.600 --> 30:09.769
but he is expected
to make a full recovery.

30:09.770 --> 30:11.519
Not if McManis gets to him first.

30:11.520 --> 30:12.960
Yeah, well that's not going to happen.

30:13.590 --> 30:15.129
I got the warden's word that Morrow

30:15.130 --> 30:17.369
will have 24 hour security
until he's better.

30:17.370 --> 30:19.359
McManis and his boys,
they're in solitary.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.550
They're not going to be a problem.

30:20.790 --> 30:22.569
You know, I got something from
Morrow during the fight.

30:22.570 --> 30:24.259
He was worried that
they were going to kill her.

30:24.260 --> 30:25.219
Well who's her?

30:25.220 --> 30:26.039
The wife?

30:26.040 --> 30:29.410
Yeah, maybe they threatened her
to make him take the fall.

30:29.510 --> 30:30.639
Well, when we spoke to her,

30:30.640 --> 30:32.270
- she didn't mention anything.
- No.

30:32.750 --> 30:33.939
Well, her life was in danger.

30:33.940 --> 30:35.840
She'd lose everything if she talked.

30:36.130 --> 30:37.460
D'you want me to bring her in?

30:37.590 --> 30:39.329
Immediately. Promise her protection,

30:39.330 --> 30:40.629
new identity, immunity,

30:40.630 --> 30:43.080
whatever it takes to get her
to testify against Boorman.

30:43.680 --> 30:44.829
Welcome back, Logan.

30:44.830 --> 30:45.865
Thanks.

30:48.220 --> 30:50.419
Nicole, we think we know
how Boorman got your husband

30:50.420 --> 30:52.170
to confess to the murder.

30:53.790 --> 30:54.950
What do you mean?

30:55.020 --> 30:56.540
He threatened you, didn't he?

30:57.473 --> 30:58.311
No.

30:58.341 --> 31:01.902
<i>Say nothing. Could lose him forever.</i>

31:02.730 --> 31:05.030
Jeremy got attacked earlier today.

31:05.650 --> 31:07.730
- What?
- Yeah, he's in bad shape.

31:08.280 --> 31:10.160
Unless we get Boorman off the streets,

31:10.220 --> 31:12.820
I really don't think Jeremy
would last long in prison.

31:13.560 --> 31:16.360
Nicole, you need to help us
save your husband.

31:17.760 --> 31:19.269
Look, we'll do everything we can to

31:19.270 --> 31:20.980
make sure you two are protected.

31:21.310 --> 31:22.679
But you need to start talking to us,

31:22.680 --> 31:24.490
you need to tell us everything you know.

31:25.210 --> 31:27.340
<i>No choice. I have to tell.</i>

31:29.190 --> 31:30.388
Who threatened you?

31:33.450 --> 31:35.590
A man. I don't know who he was.

31:36.733 --> 31:39.679
<i>Please don't... don't kill me.</i>

31:39.680 --> 31:42.069
<i>Leave her alone, OK?
Look, I'll do anything you want.</i>

31:42.070 --> 31:43.100
<i>Anything.</i>

31:47.200 --> 31:48.350
Was it this man?

31:50.990 --> 31:52.350
Yeah, his name is Roth.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.370
He came to the house.

31:56.630 --> 31:58.140
He was threatening to hurt me.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.639
Unless your husband took
the fall for Boorman?

31:59.640 --> 32:02.419
No. I had never heard of Boorman

32:02.420 --> 32:04.120
until Jeremy turned himself in.

32:04.580 --> 32:06.410
So what did this guy Roth want?

32:07.930 --> 32:11.869
He... said that Jeremy
owed him money, a lot of money,

32:11.870 --> 32:14.330
and that if he didn't pay him back,
he would hurt me.

32:14.450 --> 32:15.569
And he never mentioned Boorman?

32:15.570 --> 32:19.020
No. Never. I swear.

32:19.800 --> 32:23.149
That morning, Jeremy told me
that he was going to do something,

32:23.150 --> 32:24.549
something that would keep me safe,

32:24.550 --> 32:27.120
but that I had to keep my mouth shut
or they would kill him.

32:28.430 --> 32:30.849
Just do as I say.
You're all I care about.

32:30.850 --> 32:32.790
Don't say anything.

32:36.410 --> 32:37.810
Will Jeremy be alright?

32:38.730 --> 32:40.980
Did he say something,
is that why he was beaten?

32:40.990 --> 32:42.500
No, he didn't say anything.

32:43.950 --> 32:47.150
We'll do everything we can to make sure
he gets out of there.

32:48.100 --> 32:50.071
<i>They'll have him killed.</i>

32:51.400 --> 32:54.760
We'll make sure that you two
are protected and safe.

32:59.240 --> 33:01.290
Wife won't give up Boorman's name
in any of this?

33:01.940 --> 33:03.770
Claims Roth never mentioned him.

33:04.370 --> 33:06.070
We're getting Roth back in here.

33:06.080 --> 33:07.679
We break him, we get Boorman.

33:07.680 --> 33:09.289
Well, I thought Roth was
pretty adamant about

33:09.290 --> 33:10.129
not saying anything?

33:10.130 --> 33:13.440
Well he was. But now we got you.
Maybe we can change that.

33:13.850 --> 33:16.050
- Was that a compliment?
- I think it was.

33:22.290 --> 33:24.070
We know you're working for Boorman.

33:24.310 --> 33:26.520
We know Boorman lent money
to Jeremy Morrow

33:27.630 --> 33:29.450
and we know that
he sent you to collect it.

33:31.350 --> 33:32.830
You're his junkyard dog.

33:34.270 --> 33:37.010
From now on, do what I say,
when I say it.

33:40.490 --> 33:42.279
He got you to threaten
to kill Morrow's wife

33:42.280 --> 33:46.370
so that he would confess
to settle his debt.

33:46.630 --> 33:48.180
I did no such thing.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.620
He's got you on tight leash, doesn't he?

33:51.630 --> 33:52.910
Don't you want to change that?

33:53.040 --> 33:56.390
He'd kill me first. There's no way out.

33:58.999 --> 34:00.850
You're better than this, Roth.

34:00.880 --> 34:02.920
You caught a bad break way back when,

34:02.950 --> 34:04.870
ended up owing your life to Boorman.

34:05.020 --> 34:06.720
You can change that right now.

34:10.507 --> 34:11.790
(Beep. Beep!)

34:11.820 --> 34:14.889
<i>It's me. I'm leaving the IIB right now.</i>

34:15.630 --> 34:16.810
<i>Looks like you're right.</i>

34:17.070 --> 34:19.139
<i>Our friend on the inside must be talking.</i>

34:19.550 --> 34:22.659
<i>You got a leaky ship. You're gonna
want to patch that up.</i>

34:23.876 --> 34:25.976
- (Beep!)
- How'd you get this?

34:26.280 --> 34:28.190
- Is that even legal?
- It's called a warrant.

34:28.850 --> 34:31.380
We're looking for the burner
that made that call right now

34:31.400 --> 34:32.418
and we'll find it.

34:32.420 --> 34:34.079
When we do, we'll play this in court

34:34.080 --> 34:35.580
and then it'll be too late for you.

34:36.520 --> 34:38.679
Cut a deal now. Start talking.

34:38.920 --> 34:41.570
Becker, what is it? 15, 20 years
for conspiracy to commit murder?

34:41.600 --> 34:43.570
- Oh yeah, about that. Yeah.
- Then he'll come after me.

34:43.870 --> 34:45.188
Not if we put him away.

34:45.190 --> 34:46.760
So why don't you tell us what you know?

34:51.201 --> 34:53.070
That poor schmuck Morrow was just...

34:54.699 --> 34:57.160
He was in the wrong place
at the wrong time, you know?

34:59.000 --> 35:00.910
And he was married to the wrong woman.

35:02.220 --> 35:04.109
<i>Threaten her. He'll take the bait.</i>

35:04.110 --> 35:05.780
<i>- You're sure?
- Positive.</i>

35:17.350 --> 35:19.400
How was Jeremy's wife involved?

35:20.160 --> 35:22.430
- I'm done talking.
- Is she in this with Boorman?

35:22.990 --> 35:25.089
Look, until I have a deal signed on paper

35:25.090 --> 35:27.482
and I know I'm protected,

35:27.512 --> 35:29.210
I'm not saying another word.

35:35.187 --> 35:36.387
So Nicole and Boorman

35:36.417 --> 35:37.810
- are having an affair?
- That's right.

35:37.820 --> 35:38.899
Roth saw them together after

35:38.900 --> 35:40.580
Boorman told him to threaten Nicole.

35:40.900 --> 35:43.129
How does Nicole Morrow
end up in a relationship

35:43.130 --> 35:45.060
with a low-life like Boorman?

35:45.090 --> 35:47.289
I looked into Boorman's
credit card history,

35:47.290 --> 35:49.439
it seems like he buys all his clothes
at Clark & Brothers,

35:49.440 --> 35:51.000
he's one of their most loyal customers,

35:51.010 --> 35:52.559
he spends tens of thousands
of dollars there

35:52.560 --> 35:53.529
and guess who works there?

35:53.530 --> 35:55.049
- Nicole Morrow.
- Yeah.

35:55.050 --> 35:57.479
In my early reads, she was
scared to lose him.

35:57.480 --> 35:58.420
I thought she meant her husband,

35:58.430 --> 35:59.589
she must've meant Boorman.

35:59.590 --> 36:01.129
Maybe she's the one behind all of this.

36:01.130 --> 36:02.710
She's the one pulling the strings.

36:02.920 --> 36:05.579
So, she's afraid that she's going
to lose her sugar daddy

36:05.580 --> 36:07.210
'cause he can't fix his trial.

36:07.250 --> 36:10.159
She tells him that her husband
will do anything for her.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.419
She pretends to be terrified
when Roth threatens her.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.129
And then she sends her
broke husband to jail

36:14.130 --> 36:15.409
instead of her rich boyfriend.

36:15.410 --> 36:17.049
Poor sap thinks he's got
a loving wife waiting

36:17.050 --> 36:18.519
for him when he gets out of prison.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.399
Well, we need to give Morrow
this information,

36:20.400 --> 36:22.269
maybe it will make him
recant his confession.

36:22.270 --> 36:23.839
No, I don't think Morrow recanting

36:23.840 --> 36:25.709
is going to be enough
to stop the conviction.

36:25.710 --> 36:27.070
The guy had the murder weapon.

36:27.430 --> 36:28.919
OK, then we bring Nicole back in

36:28.920 --> 36:30.210
and we make her tell the truth.

36:30.400 --> 36:31.960
I doubt that she'd give up Boorman,

36:31.970 --> 36:33.340
she's doing this for him.

36:34.440 --> 36:35.869
We need a confession, guys.

36:35.870 --> 36:37.880
And it either comes from
Nicole or Boorman.

36:44.380 --> 36:45.580
What're you doing here?

36:46.140 --> 36:47.660
I need to talk to Boorman.

36:48.350 --> 36:50.489
It's OK, Nicole. What is it?

36:50.490 --> 36:51.890
I can't do this any more.

36:53.320 --> 36:56.380
The cops are at me.
They know I'm involved.

36:56.580 --> 36:57.979
They're going to find out and
they're going to arrest...

36:57.980 --> 36:58.979
They don't know anything.

36:58.980 --> 37:01.060
I'm telling you, they know!

37:03.060 --> 37:05.360
They have brought me in twice now.

37:05.430 --> 37:08.570
And both times they let you go.
They have nothing.

37:09.750 --> 37:11.040
Maybe not now. But when Morrow talks...

37:12.700 --> 37:15.250
- That's not going to happen.
- How would you know?

37:16.970 --> 37:20.000
Let's just say that...
he's been taken care of.

37:20.010 --> 37:21.410
What do you mean, taken care of?

37:21.920 --> 37:24.420
Jeremy's not going to have
the chance to talk.

37:25.620 --> 37:28.329
- You put out a hit.
- Look, we have nothing to worry about.

37:28.330 --> 37:30.390
I'm in the clear and so are you.

37:30.510 --> 37:32.130
You used a guy on the inside.

37:32.390 --> 37:34.113
I got people everywhere.

37:34.440 --> 37:36.180
Why the hell are you so interested?

37:37.790 --> 37:39.300
Because I'm involved.

37:39.610 --> 37:42.050
You go down, I could go down too.

37:43.250 --> 37:46.030
Sean said you were
a terrible boxer, Roth.

37:46.500 --> 37:48.930
But you're an even worse liar.

37:50.700 --> 37:52.190
Ho! I knew it.

37:52.400 --> 37:54.500
You bastard! How could you?!

37:56.100 --> 37:58.389
- Ho! I told you!
- Hands where I can see them.

37:58.390 --> 38:00.330
- Now!
- I told you he couldn't be trusted!

38:06.410 --> 38:07.722
Good job.

38:10.730 --> 38:13.090
Maya was good people.
A good friend.

38:14.260 --> 38:17.239
- And did she ever mention Toby?
- Not by name, no.

38:17.240 --> 38:19.200
But once or twice she spoke of her boy.

38:19.480 --> 38:21.460
And when I asked about him she'd smile.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.740
Said he was better off without her.

38:23.920 --> 38:26.029
Seemed complicated, so I didn't press.

38:26.030 --> 38:28.069
You mentioned she spoke
about an institute?

38:28.070 --> 38:30.040
Yeah, it always made her pretty upset.

38:30.150 --> 38:31.510
What kind of institute was it?

38:31.790 --> 38:34.119
I always assumed it was
a rehab center or something.

38:34.120 --> 38:35.700
She didn't drink, so...

38:36.190 --> 38:38.050
Can you tell us anything else
about her?

38:38.760 --> 38:40.978
- She made a mean rhubarb pie.
- (Chuckles)

38:41.008 --> 38:43.670
No, I'm telling you. She'd bake for
the whole neighbourhood.

38:43.700 --> 38:46.150
Maya had a way of always
making you feel right at home.

38:46.710 --> 38:49.040
- What do you mean?
- She had an amazing insight.

38:49.240 --> 38:50.690
Like she knew what you were thinking.

38:54.260 --> 38:56.280
And when was the last time you saw her?

38:56.370 --> 38:59.400
About a year ago now.
She just took up and left.

38:59.750 --> 39:02.189
- You didn't find that strange?
- A little, I guess.

39:02.190 --> 39:03.949
But she always said she never liked
to spend too long

39:03.950 --> 39:06.700
in one place. She had
the vagabond spirit.

39:06.970 --> 39:08.120
So you don't know where she is now?

39:08.170 --> 39:10.759
No, I don't. But since
I got your phone call

39:10.760 --> 39:12.389
I've been thinking about the day she left,

39:12.390 --> 39:13.849
playing it over and over again
in my head,

39:13.850 --> 39:15.140
and there was something strange.

39:15.170 --> 39:16.600
What? What's that?

39:16.630 --> 39:18.550
Well, her and me used to go
for walks in the morning.

39:18.580 --> 39:19.860
Grab a coffee.

39:19.890 --> 39:22.039
And that morning, I went
to her house to pick her up.

39:22.040 --> 39:23.939
There was a cable truck parked outside.

39:23.940 --> 39:25.470
And what's so weird about
a cable truck?

39:25.500 --> 39:26.690
She didn't own a TV.

39:27.600 --> 39:29.849
So, why would she install
a cable on the day

39:29.850 --> 39:32.220
she was going to leave? Don't you think
that's a little weird?

39:32.620 --> 39:34.329
Do you remember the name
of the cable company?

39:34.330 --> 39:37.430
Yeah, I think it was Westerly
or Westerbrook cable.

39:37.520 --> 39:40.000
It had a big B on the logo.

39:41.340 --> 39:43.690
Meh. Sorry. It's really all I know.

39:43.960 --> 39:46.050
Can we contact you if we have
any more questions?

39:46.480 --> 39:49.630
- 'Course. Good luck.
- Yeah.

39:54.200 --> 39:55.730
OK. So where do we go from here?

39:55.820 --> 39:57.900
Well, we follow up with the cable company
and maybe they

39:57.970 --> 39:59.750
have something to do with
Maya's disappearance.

40:01.030 --> 40:04.009
And... maybe we come clean with Toby.

40:04.010 --> 40:07.190
No. Toby can't be involved.
I've seen him hurt over this before.

40:07.990 --> 40:09.719
OK. So we don't tell him anything

40:09.720 --> 40:11.340
until we have something solid.

40:13.607 --> 40:14.837
OK.

40:17.332 --> 40:20.300
(Heart monitor beeping.)

40:20.330 --> 40:21.450
IIB.

40:25.410 --> 40:26.500
Jeremy.

40:27.929 --> 40:29.470
I don't want to talk to you.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.353
I understand. Um...

40:34.760 --> 40:36.260
I've got to tell you something.

40:37.570 --> 40:38.895
It's about your wife.

40:44.590 --> 40:48.720
She uh... was living a lie.

40:48.893 --> 40:52.670
Her and Boorman...
were having an affair.

40:53.870 --> 40:55.964
It was her idea to threaten you...

40:57.710 --> 40:59.030
with the big guy, Roth.

41:03.440 --> 41:05.040
Toby should be home any minute.

41:05.070 --> 41:07.680
Yes, he should be. Now will you sit down
and take a deep breath?

41:07.710 --> 41:09.470
Sheeze. You're stressing me out.

41:09.718 --> 41:11.761
- Oh-ho...
- Hey.

41:12.282 --> 41:14.180
- Hey...
- (Laughs softly)

41:15.520 --> 41:18.419
I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

41:18.420 --> 41:19.389
So worried about you.

41:19.390 --> 41:21.109
I know, I told you I'd be gone
for a few hours but I uh,

41:21.110 --> 41:23.009
spent the night in prison.

41:23.010 --> 41:24.749
- It's good to have you back, bud.
- Good to be back.

41:24.750 --> 41:26.096
Good to see you.

41:26.430 --> 41:27.359
You're sure you're alright?

41:27.360 --> 41:29.639
- You'd tell me if you were not.
- Of course, of course.

41:29.640 --> 41:31.739
Uneventful. Went in,
got what we needed.

41:31.740 --> 41:33.240
Got the bad guy.

41:33.270 --> 41:34.949
(Sing-song): Boring.

41:34.979 --> 41:36.469
Well, I want to hear all
about it but first,

41:36.470 --> 41:37.510
you must be starving.

41:37.540 --> 41:39.829
- Can I get you something to eat?
- That'd be awesome. Thank you.

41:39.830 --> 41:41.405
I'll have whatever he's having.

41:41.874 --> 41:43.450
Portion and a half.

41:45.020 --> 41:46.150
Totally uneventful, huh?

41:46.950 --> 41:48.120
Oh, man.

41:48.150 --> 41:50.739
- Yeah. Uneventful.
- Mm.

41:51.252 --> 41:52.880
(Quietly): What about this?

41:52.910 --> 41:56.160
Everything went OK. I don't want
to get her worried, alright?

41:56.720 --> 41:58.180
Ignorance is bliss, my friend.

41:58.610 --> 42:01.480
- Sometimes.
- What'd you mean by that?

42:02.230 --> 42:04.870
A toast! Very nice idea!
Yeah!

42:06.486 --> 42:07.648
Thank you.

42:08.362 --> 42:09.626
- Welcome home, bud.
- To Toby.

42:09.656 --> 42:11.249
- Thanks. Cheers.
- Home safe and sound.

42:11.250 --> 42:12.519
Indeed.

42:17.040 --> 42:18.749
Tastes like home, doesn't it?
