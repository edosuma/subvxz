00:01.794 --> 00:03.504
Previously on 90210--

00:03.629 --> 00:05.046
HARRY:
Teachers cannot be alone
off campus with students.

00:05.172 --> 00:06.507
RYAN:
Kim's not a student.

00:06.632 --> 00:09.301
I'm going to have to ask you
to take a paid leave of absence.

00:09.426 --> 00:11.178
I decided to read Silver's blog.

00:11.303 --> 00:13.138
They think I'm a sleazeball,
they really do.

00:13.263 --> 00:15.056
Any girl would be lucky
to have a chance

00:15.182 --> 00:16.433
with someone like you.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.811
Remember, when you're out there,
just look at me.

00:18.936 --> 00:20.103
When you're onstage,
there's nobody else.

00:21.563 --> 00:22.648
I love you.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.775
I don't know what to say.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.110
Don't say anything.

00:27.235 --> 00:28.487
Just forget it.

00:28.612 --> 00:30.906
What? I have to say
something back?

00:31.699 --> 00:33.450
Screw you, Dixon!

00:33.575 --> 00:34.660
I'm pregnant.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.578
You want to have
this baby,

00:36.704 --> 00:38.330
I'll go with you
to Lamaze class.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.624
If you don't want
to have it, I'll
take you to the clinic.

00:40.749 --> 00:41.834
And if you can't decide,

00:41.959 --> 00:43.752
I'll sit with you
until you can.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.892
HARRY:
It's great to have you back,
Ryan.

00:58.017 --> 00:59.476
Listen, that seminar
up in Berkeley

00:59.601 --> 01:01.436
that you wanted to go
to next month?
Mm-hmm.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.772
It took some doing,
but I got the school board

01:03.898 --> 01:05.399
to clear it.

01:05.524 --> 01:06.775
Air fare and hotel.

01:06.901 --> 01:08.443
I mean, don't book
the Biltmore or anything,

01:08.569 --> 01:09.945
but you're going.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.822
You know what,
send someone else.

01:11.947 --> 01:13.240
Are you sure?

01:13.365 --> 01:14.909
That's all you could talk
about last fall.

01:15.034 --> 01:16.618
I got to be honest
with you, Harry.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.620
I don't know how much longer
I'm going to be teaching.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.706
What do you mean?

01:20.831 --> 01:23.417
I just think I was a little
naive when I started here.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.836
You know, I wanted
to make a difference

01:25.961 --> 01:27.880
and reach the kids

01:28.005 --> 01:30.215
and that didn't really work out
too well, did it?

01:30.340 --> 01:31.759
I think my Dead Poet Society

01:31.884 --> 01:33.301
days are over.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.220
I'm just going to do a job
and cash a paycheck.

01:35.345 --> 01:38.223
You've had a rough
couple of months.

01:38.348 --> 01:39.641
Let's just see how things go.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.230
KELLY:
Ryan...

01:45.355 --> 01:46.523
I mean Mr. Matthews.

01:46.648 --> 01:47.524
You're back.

01:47.649 --> 01:48.859
So it seems.

01:48.984 --> 01:50.778
I'm surprised to see you.

01:50.903 --> 01:53.363
You didn't call or anything.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.573
Was I supposed to?

01:54.698 --> 01:56.867
No, no. Uh, no.

01:56.992 --> 01:58.702
Maybe we could
have lunch

01:58.827 --> 02:00.037
or something.

02:00.161 --> 02:02.122
I don't think
that's a great idea.

02:05.709 --> 02:08.211
(with exaggerated
British accent):
Ah, the theater.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.630
(normal voice):
You gonna run lights again?

02:09.755 --> 02:11.966
Uh, I don't know.

02:12.091 --> 02:13.675
Well, Silver's
stage managing.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.176
So it's a yes?

02:15.302 --> 02:17.220
So that's an I don't know.

02:17.345 --> 02:18.764
You guys doing okay?

02:18.889 --> 02:20.808
Pretending to be anyway.

02:20.933 --> 02:23.602
That's cryptic.
Yeah.

02:23.727 --> 02:25.562
DIXON:
Hey, why don't you
go say hi to Annie.

02:25.687 --> 02:28.189
See ya.
Later.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.152
"Say to great Caesar this:

02:32.277 --> 02:33.988
"in deputation I kiss
his conquering hand;

02:34.113 --> 02:36.740
tell him I am prompt to lay
my crown at his feet."

02:36.865 --> 02:38.575
That is some fancy
talk right there, missy.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.660
I know, right?

02:39.785 --> 02:41.536
So poetic, so eloquent.

02:41.662 --> 02:42.955
So... Shakespearean.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.624
I'm so glad the new drama
teacher chose this play.

02:45.749 --> 02:47.793
God, I want to
play her so bad.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.711
Who?
Cleopatra.

02:49.837 --> 02:50.879
Oh, right, yeah, of course.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.339
No, I think you'd
be great as her.

02:52.464 --> 02:53.715
You do?
Yeah.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.676
I mean, I'd love to.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.511
Cleopatra? It's a role I always
thought I'd play, eventually.

02:57.636 --> 02:58.679
Not necessarily in high school
though,

02:58.804 --> 02:59.680
but you know, when
opportunity knocks...

02:59.805 --> 03:01.473
You'd better answer.

03:01.598 --> 03:03.684
You know, my grandma was
up for the movie role,

03:03.809 --> 03:05.602
but she said that
Elizabeth Taylor

03:05.727 --> 03:07.562
stole her part-- "that
violet-eyed hussy."

03:07.688 --> 03:09.690
CASEY:
Okay, good luck, everyone.

03:09.815 --> 03:13.192
I should mention that we'll be
using lots of strobe effects,

03:13.318 --> 03:16.822
so please don't audition
if you're epileptic, okay?

03:16.947 --> 03:19.783
Ms. Casey, I have to tell you,
I saw the Equus you directed

03:19.908 --> 03:21.660
at the Red Cat.

03:21.785 --> 03:24.872
You want to brownnose,
kiddo, wash my car, okay?

03:24.997 --> 03:27.541
Wilson, right?

03:27.666 --> 03:30.127
Yeah. Hi.

03:30.251 --> 03:33.380
I watched a video of you
in Spring Awakening.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.632
You were the understudy, right?

03:35.757 --> 03:36.800
Pretty damn impressive

03:36.925 --> 03:38.093
stepping in like that.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.970
Well, the show much go on,
right?

03:40.095 --> 03:42.222
I look forward to your audition.

03:42.347 --> 03:45.684
"I am prompt to lay
my crown at your feet."

03:45.809 --> 03:47.352
(clicks tongue)

03:47.477 --> 03:49.063
Did you see that?
She winked at me.

03:49.188 --> 03:50.939
Yeah. No, I don't know if
there's betting in theater,

03:51.065 --> 03:52.399
but I'd say you've got
pretty good odds.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.651
You know what, you
should audition, too.

03:54.776 --> 03:55.819
You'd be done before baseball,

03:55.944 --> 03:57.905
and it'd be fun.
No.

03:58.030 --> 04:00.741
Oh, come on. Otherwise
we're never going to get
to spend time together.

04:00.866 --> 04:02.450
I'm going to be
rehearsing like every day.

04:02.576 --> 04:03.827
I'm not... an actor.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.495
Well, there are

04:05.620 --> 04:06.747
tons of small parts.

04:06.872 --> 04:07.956
No, I shouldn't say that.

04:08.082 --> 04:10.084
There are no small parts,
only small actors.

04:10.209 --> 04:11.960
There are tons of less
time-consuming parts,

04:12.086 --> 04:13.294
shall we say.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.629
Yeah, I don't know.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.257
I mean, five minutes onstage
in front of people,

04:17.382 --> 04:19.676
I start sweating more than I do
in an entire lacrosse game.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.469
Pretty please.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.597
You would make an excellent
Egyptian slave boy.

04:23.722 --> 04:24.765
Seriously.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.307
I'd summon you to my chamber.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.393
That's an enticing offer.

04:28.518 --> 04:29.978
(giggling)
Enticing.

04:32.147 --> 04:34.942
Hey, that looks like
a nutritious breakfast.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.444
There's nuts.
That's a protein.

04:37.569 --> 04:39.029
So what's going on?

04:39.154 --> 04:41.031
Things are crazy.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.116
My schedule's totally insane.

04:42.241 --> 04:44.034
My commercial agent
just called.

04:44.159 --> 04:47.370
I got to go in today at 3:00
for some toothpaste commercial.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.164
"Because for your teeth,
white is right."

04:49.289 --> 04:52.042
And tomorrow it's the
Antony and Cleopatra audition.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.794
And I so want Cleopatra.

04:53.919 --> 04:55.754
It's such a dark,
tragic role,

04:55.879 --> 04:57.714
and I've never done anything
like it before.

04:57.839 --> 05:01.093
So I'm going to be up all night
with Will Shakes studying.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.971
Sounds like you're really busy.

05:04.096 --> 05:05.889
I know, it's total chaos.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.266
I really hope I don't smile

05:07.390 --> 05:09.101
during my Cleopatra
suicide monologue

05:09.226 --> 05:10.602
or kill myself during
my toothpaste commercial.

05:10.727 --> 05:13.730
I need another coffee.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.398
More coffee?

05:15.523 --> 05:17.192
Are you sure that's
a good Idea, Ades?

05:17.317 --> 05:18.902
Because of the
toothpaste commercial?

05:19.027 --> 05:20.737
Two coffees won't
stain my teeth.

05:20.862 --> 05:22.906
No, because you're pregnant.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.117
Ade, remember?

05:27.286 --> 05:29.204
Look, have you been to
the doctor at least?

05:29.329 --> 05:30.789
You said you would
go last week.

05:30.914 --> 05:32.707
I-I've been busy.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.584
Can't you see?

05:34.709 --> 05:36.586
I mean, I would
have gone today,
but the commercial.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.421
Hey, can I get one more?
Sure.

05:38.546 --> 05:39.506
Well, tomorrow?

05:39.631 --> 05:40.966
Tomorrow is
the school audition.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.801
Oh, can you lend me a dollar?

05:42.926 --> 05:44.803
You know what, Ade, you really
have to deal with this, okay?

05:44.928 --> 05:47.514
MAN:
There you go.
Thanks.

05:47.639 --> 05:50.934
I got to get off-book.

05:51.059 --> 05:52.894
Yeah.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.443
Good to see you back, dude.

06:00.568 --> 06:02.029
How was South Korea?

06:02.154 --> 06:03.947
It was South Dakota.
It was fine.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.949
Hey, so, Mr. Matthews,

06:06.074 --> 06:09.703
does the cop use
her handcuffs in bed?

06:09.828 --> 06:11.955
I'm going to need you all
to take your seats

06:12.080 --> 06:13.665
in alphabetical order.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.374
Seriously?

06:15.500 --> 06:18.419
Seriously. Name cards
are on your desks.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.214
Sit, now.

06:26.511 --> 06:29.681
Um, Mr. Matthews, I think the
mountain air pickled your brain,

06:29.806 --> 06:31.266
because you forgot me.

06:31.390 --> 06:34.311
Straight from Saberi
to Sondheimer.

06:34.435 --> 06:36.604
Ms. Silver, I am transferring
you out of this class.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.690
Excuse me?

06:38.815 --> 06:40.359
I've already filled out
the forms.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.069
I've discussed it
with Principal Wilson.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.612
You will be in Mr. Kaplan's
English class.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.823
He's the worst teacher here.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.534
The dude calls Tom Clancy
"The Bard."

06:49.659 --> 06:52.120
Good luck to you.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.711
Mr. Matthews,
what is this about?

06:59.836 --> 07:02.089
I don't think I can be objective
with you as a student

07:02.214 --> 07:03.882
given our history.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.385
Our history?

07:06.509 --> 07:08.595
Yeah, as in you calling me
"a child molesting pervert"

07:08.720 --> 07:11.139
on your blog and almost
costing me my job.

07:11.265 --> 07:12.974
Oh, right.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.852
Um, my bad.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.939
I think it's best
if I'm not your teacher--

07:19.064 --> 07:21.191
for both of us.

07:21.316 --> 07:22.859
(school bell ringing)

07:22.984 --> 07:24.569
Quiet please.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.158
Look, Mr. Matthews...

07:30.284 --> 07:33.787
I was actually looking forward
to this class--

07:33.912 --> 07:35.747
to your class.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.665
It might sound corny,

07:37.791 --> 07:40.127
but you're not like
the other teachers.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.296
Maybe that was my problem.

07:42.421 --> 07:45.632
I understand the sub had you
reading Heart of Darkness.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.134
Did he assign a paper?

07:47.259 --> 07:49.803
Yeah, a three-page study
on the character of our choice.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.721
Lame.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.681
Sounds fine to me.
Please double-space it,

07:53.807 --> 07:55.558
and make sure to use
standard margins.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.812
Ms. Silver, you can go.

08:06.194 --> 08:07.946
So thanks for coming in.

08:08.071 --> 08:09.323
Oh, thank you.

08:09.448 --> 08:10.824
My teeth feel
cleaner already.

08:10.949 --> 08:11.950
(both chuckling)

08:12.075 --> 08:13.493
Bye.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.537
What are you guys

08:16.663 --> 08:17.622
doing here?

08:17.747 --> 08:20.167
We need to talk.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.190
Okay, I don't have
time for this.

08:43.315 --> 08:45.025
I have to meet my agent
in three minutes.

08:45.150 --> 08:46.276
Okay, well, then give us
three minutes.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.362
This is important.

08:48.487 --> 08:49.654
You called in
the guidance counselor?

08:49.779 --> 08:51.572
The frickin' guidance counselor?

08:51.698 --> 08:53.241
I had to, Ade. You're pregnant.

08:53.367 --> 08:55.202
You think I don't know that?

08:55.327 --> 08:57.204
You don't seem like you know it.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.788
You certainly don't act like it.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.748
Well, why don't I go get
some pickles and ice cream.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.209
Would that
make you happy?

09:02.334 --> 09:03.584
Naomi just
thought that

09:03.710 --> 09:05.086
I would be a good
resource for you,

09:05.212 --> 09:06.213
and she was right.

09:06.338 --> 09:07.797
You need to see a doctor.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.299
You have to start
taking care of yourself.

09:09.424 --> 09:10.675
The coffee,

09:10.800 --> 09:12.760
the staying up late,
it's all got to go.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.262
As a pregnant teenager,
you're in a high-risk group

09:14.388 --> 09:16.223
for all kinds of problems.

09:16.348 --> 09:18.308
If you don't get proper care,
you could lose this baby.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.435
NAOMI:
Right, but you also

09:20.560 --> 09:22.979
have to consider your options,
okay? She's 16.

09:23.104 --> 09:26.024
Teenagers do this a lot
with the right support...

09:26.149 --> 09:27.901
Support, right, okay.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.569
Ms. Taylor, Ade doesn't
have the support.

09:29.694 --> 09:31.821
Her dad is gone and her
mother is a nightmare.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.240
Naomi, shut up.

09:33.365 --> 09:34.908
Ade, you deserve
to have a future.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.951
You deserve to get
to to go college

09:37.077 --> 09:39.787
and have a career,
and have a real family someday.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.998
I'm saying you should
have an abortion.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.959
I'm done.

09:46.711 --> 09:49.381
Of course, you should
consider all of your options.

09:49.506 --> 09:53.343
But in my experience,
teens so often rush to abortion

09:53.468 --> 09:55.345
like it's the only option.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.638
But she could have
this child if she wants to.

09:57.764 --> 10:00.058
I mean, if you're not
ready to be a mother,

10:00.183 --> 10:01.393
then there's
always adoption.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.770
So many people desperately
want to have kids that can't.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.730
Am I to understand that
you're encouraging her

10:05.855 --> 10:07.023
to continue with
this pregnancy?

10:07.148 --> 10:09.109
Do you really think--
no offense, Ade--

10:09.234 --> 10:10.944
do you really think
she's responsible enough?

10:11.069 --> 10:12.946
Look how she's handled it so...
You know what?

10:13.071 --> 10:15.740
Next time you guys decide
to intrude in someone's life,

10:15.865 --> 10:17.325
get your agendas straight first.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.494
Okay, this is your choice,
not ours.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.329
But you have to take
control of this,

10:21.455 --> 10:23.623
of your life
before it takes control of you.

10:30.088 --> 10:31.881
"Miss Silver"?

10:32.006 --> 10:34.050
Who calls me Miss Silver?

10:34.175 --> 10:36.052
Unbelievable, right?

10:36.177 --> 10:37.720
Well, um, it
sounds to me...

10:37.845 --> 10:39.473
I mean, anyone else,
anyone else

10:39.598 --> 10:42.267
kicks me out of their class
and... I'm proud of it.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.269
But Mr.
Matthews is...

10:44.394 --> 10:46.563
he's, like, the one teacher
in this whole school

10:46.687 --> 10:49.357
who isn't some
brain-dead zombie jerk.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.151
How could he do this to me?

10:51.276 --> 10:54.028
Okay. Um...

10:54.154 --> 10:57.198
well, you did kind of harsh
on him on "The Vicious Circle."

10:57.324 --> 10:59.159
"Professor Pervert"?

10:59.284 --> 11:01.286
"Matthews Wades
in the Kiddie Pool"?

11:01.411 --> 11:02.454
"Dips Into the
Kiddie Pool."

11:02.579 --> 11:04.414
And as far as
I knew, he did.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.082
I didn't do
anything wrong.

11:06.207 --> 11:08.084
Still, he has feelings.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.795
Yeah, okay. So what?

11:12.172 --> 11:13.632
So...

11:13.756 --> 11:15.967
(laughs softly):
Mr. Matthews probably

11:16.092 --> 11:20.847
didn't want to be hurt
by what you said, but he was.

11:20.972 --> 11:25.560
You know, guys like
to play like they're hard,

11:25.684 --> 11:28.104
you know, like they
don't have any feelings,

11:28.229 --> 11:31.191
or like they don't get hurt
by what you say,

11:31.316 --> 11:32.567
but they do get hurt.

11:35.111 --> 11:38.114
Even when they say
something's cool...

11:38.239 --> 11:40.116
maybe it's not.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.243
(laughs softly):
Yeah.

11:42.369 --> 11:45.622
And... you're intense.

11:45.746 --> 11:49.042
Some things you say have the
power to hurt people, you know?

11:49.167 --> 11:51.002
Yeah. I think I do.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.380
Yeah?

11:53.505 --> 11:55.382
You know what I'm gonna do?

11:55.507 --> 11:57.800
You don't have to do anything.
I do.

11:57.925 --> 11:59.302
And I'm going to.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.388
I'm gonna win
Mr. Matthews back.

12:01.513 --> 12:05.058
I'm gonna write
the best paper

12:05.183 --> 12:07.352
on Heart of Darkness
that has ever been written

12:07.477 --> 12:09.229
in the history of
English papers ever.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.523
So...

12:11.648 --> 12:13.191
you're gonna do the assignment

12:13.316 --> 12:15.485
even though
you're not in the class?

12:15.610 --> 12:18.238
Prepare to have your mind
blown, Mr. Matthews.

12:57.985 --> 12:59.571

No, that's just it-- she's not.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.491
She's... not in Paris,

13:03.617 --> 13:05.285
or she's not coming back? What?
Kiddo,

13:05.410 --> 13:07.245
your mother's going through
kind of a tough time.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.913
She thought she found
her birth son.

13:09.038 --> 13:11.332
He turned out to be a
con man-- what a shock.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.500
She says she's getting

13:12.626 --> 13:14.085
migraines again,
she wants a little R&amp;R,

13:15.545 --> 13:18.005
What? For how long?

13:18.131 --> 13:19.507
I don't know; all bets are off.

to hold off

19:58.280 --> 20:00.825
We'll be fantastic
once you really get a chance

20:00.950 --> 20:03.285
to, you know,
get comfortable with your part.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.998
I... What-what does that mean?

20:07.123 --> 20:10.084
(chuckles):
Well... I mean,

20:10.209 --> 20:13.546
up there you weren't always
giving me lots of emotion,

20:13.671 --> 20:16.841
which... made it hard for me
to find some of my beats.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.300
(quietly):
Ah...

20:18.425 --> 20:19.593
Don't worry,
you're gonna get there.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.137
Just try to remember
your blocking cues,

20:21.261 --> 20:23.389
'cause a couple of times you
stepped right in front of me.

20:25.975 --> 20:27.393
Hey, I got to go.

20:27.518 --> 20:28.728
Don't worry.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.813
We'll keep it professional.
(chuckles)

20:32.690 --> 20:34.608
(quietly):
Oh, yes.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.652
No worries.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.446
What is your problem?

20:39.572 --> 20:41.908
Taking out a personal
grudge on a student?

20:42.033 --> 20:42.909
You're off base.

20:43.034 --> 20:45.536
Look, us getting together

20:45.661 --> 20:47.496
didn't work out for
either of us, okay?

20:47.621 --> 20:48.956
But don't punish
my sister.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.499
You know what?

20:50.624 --> 20:52.793
West Beverly High
doesn't revolve

20:52.919 --> 20:54.253
around Kelly Taylor's love life.

20:54.378 --> 20:58.716
You know, Ryan, if anybody
should be pissed here, it's me.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.009
Brenda? Really?

21:00.134 --> 21:01.301
You know what, Kelly?

21:01.427 --> 21:02.636
My decision
to transfer Silver out

21:02.762 --> 21:04.722
had nothing to do
with you, okay, or us.

21:04.847 --> 21:06.265
Then what?

21:11.104 --> 21:12.939
I had a lot of time to think

21:13.064 --> 21:13.981
in South Dakota,
all right?

21:14.107 --> 21:15.733
And you know
what I realized?

21:15.858 --> 21:17.985
I'm burned out.

21:18.111 --> 21:20.780
You're burned out? You're 23.

21:20.905 --> 21:24.200
You know, I used to come
to work here every day

21:24.324 --> 21:26.953
and pour my heart and soul
into what I did, you know?

21:27.078 --> 21:30.664
I... I went out on a limb.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.041
And the limb broke.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.835
Okay, everybody
thought the worst of me.

21:34.961 --> 21:36.212
The students, the teachers.

21:36.336 --> 21:39.757
I mean, students that I thought
actually knew me.

21:39.882 --> 21:44.137
Silver? She...
Did you see what she wrote?

21:44.262 --> 21:45.930
She got carried away.
She's a kid.

21:46.055 --> 21:46.889
They're all kids, Ryan.

21:47.014 --> 21:48.390
Yeah, maybe so,

21:48.515 --> 21:51.435
but it happened, and, uh...

21:51.560 --> 21:53.854
I can't be the kind of teacher
I was before.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.023
So I'm punching the clock
till the end of the year,

21:56.149 --> 21:57.566
and then that's it for me.

21:57.691 --> 21:59.026
And then what?

21:59.152 --> 22:00.069
I don't know.

22:00.194 --> 22:03.072
I guess we'll see.

22:03.197 --> 22:04.991
But with Silver, it's just,
it's better this way.

22:05.116 --> 22:06.033
for both of us, all right?

22:06.159 --> 22:07.493
In fact, give this back to her.

22:07.618 --> 22:09.912
This is not the Ryan Matthews
I know.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.789
Yeah, well,
maybe you don't know me.

22:11.914 --> 22:12.790
Maybe I don't want to.

22:12.915 --> 22:15.542
But I do know
one thing:

22:15.668 --> 22:16.961
You're a teacher, a good one.

22:17.086 --> 22:19.964
And when a kid busts her ass
to write a paper for a class

22:20.089 --> 22:24.010
she's not even in, what kind
of teacher doesn't read it?

22:29.765 --> 22:31.976
(sighs)

22:35.729 --> 22:36.522
Ms. Casey?

22:38.024 --> 22:40.109
Hi, I'm Adrianna Tate-Duncan.

22:40.234 --> 22:41.694
Oh.

22:41.819 --> 22:43.654
I'm a little late, I know.

22:43.779 --> 22:44.947
A little?

22:45.072 --> 22:47.825
I am so-so-so-so sorry

22:47.950 --> 22:49.243
I had a doctor's appointment.

22:49.367 --> 22:52.705
Your scene partner came
and went. It's done, so...

22:52.830 --> 22:57.751
Okay, listen, I...
I know the whole play.

22:57.877 --> 23:01.214
Every word. Can...

23:01.339 --> 23:03.924
Can-can I do the suicide scene
for you at least, please?

23:04.050 --> 23:05.301
Please?

23:05.425 --> 23:07.803
This is not how
we do it in New York, honey.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.387
Sorry.

23:19.232 --> 23:20.691
(exhales nervously)

23:22.735 --> 23:23.944
Give me my robe.

23:25.946 --> 23:28.657
Put on my crown.

23:28.782 --> 23:33.913
I have immortal longings in me.

23:35.998 --> 23:37.958
Now no more

23:38.084 --> 23:43.089
the juice of Egypt's grape
shall moist this lip.

24:16.914 --> 24:18.707
Oh, hey, nix-nix.

24:18.832 --> 24:21.085
Pasta?

24:21.210 --> 24:22.795
And steamed artichokes.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.964
Hey, I thought you might want
to ask Silver to join us.

24:25.089 --> 24:27.049
Didn't you tell me
she's an artichoke fiend?

24:27.174 --> 24:30.219
Um, the girl likes artichokes.

24:30.344 --> 24:31.637
Well, it'd be nice

24:31.762 --> 24:33.973
to have her over for dinner
at some point.

24:35.849 --> 24:38.352
Or not.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.148
Sit.

24:48.321 --> 24:50.864
Talk to your mother.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.658
What about?

24:52.783 --> 24:54.868
Well, what's going on
with you and Silver?

24:54.994 --> 24:55.995
Are you guys having
problems?

24:59.039 --> 25:01.083
Not according to her.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.793
Well, what about according
to you?

25:05.879 --> 25:10.217
Well, you know, we kind of got
into a fight.

25:10.343 --> 25:13.179
Well...

25:13.304 --> 25:15.848
first I told her I loved her.

25:15.973 --> 25:18.600
You did?

25:18.725 --> 25:23.647
But we-we got into
a fight after, you know?

25:23.772 --> 25:25.232
She just blew up on me.

25:25.358 --> 25:28.027
Like, I don't even get it.

25:28.152 --> 25:29.695
Well, did you talk about it?

25:29.820 --> 25:31.238
Does she know you're upset?

25:31.364 --> 25:33.991
We kind of decided not to talk
about it, you know?

25:34.116 --> 25:35.951
Just sweep it under a rug.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.995
How's that going?

25:38.120 --> 25:40.164
Just feels like there's
something big under the rug.

25:40.289 --> 25:41.457
Somebody's gonna break
their neck.

25:41.581 --> 25:46.253
Mm. You up for some
maternal wisdom?

25:46.379 --> 25:49.673
Tsk. Willing to
take a risk.

25:49.798 --> 25:52.426
I like flowers, right?

25:52.550 --> 25:55.012
I mean, big shockeroo,
a girl likes flowers.

25:55.137 --> 25:57.723
But your dad never

25:57.848 --> 25:59.725
ever brought me flowers.

25:59.850 --> 26:02.769
I would hint, I would sulk,
I would open magazines

26:02.895 --> 26:05.981
to photos of flowers, and he
would never ever get the clues.

26:06.106 --> 26:08.275
Birthdays, Valentine's Day,
no flowers.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.819
Finally, I came up

26:10.944 --> 26:14.823
with something very crafty,
very clever.

26:14.948 --> 26:16.242
What's that?

26:16.367 --> 26:20.787
I said "I want flowers."

26:20.913 --> 26:23.249
Oh... (laughs)

26:23.374 --> 26:24.833
People aren't mind readers.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.294
Even people who are
really close.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.880
If you're upset
with Silver,

26:30.005 --> 26:32.341
you can't just expect her
to just know that.

26:32.466 --> 26:35.635
You have to tell her
and be direct.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.396
ADRIANNA:
Hi.

26:45.521 --> 26:49.316
Hey, Miss
No Cell Phone Service.

26:49.442 --> 26:51.068
Feel like I should
have sent a pigeon carrier

26:51.193 --> 26:52.027
or smoke signals.

26:52.152 --> 26:54.196
(chuckles)

26:58.033 --> 27:00.077
I'm sorry.

27:00.202 --> 27:01.995
I just had to drive.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.705
Where to, Solvang?

27:03.830 --> 27:05.958
Nowhere.

27:06.083 --> 27:09.711
I just drove
and drove and drove,

27:09.836 --> 27:13.340
trying to figure out
what I should do.

27:13.466 --> 27:15.675
And?

27:15.801 --> 27:17.970
And I was driving
up the coast

27:18.095 --> 27:22.141
and I kept seeing
these people on the beach.

27:22.266 --> 27:28.939
They were playing volleyball
and flying kites...

27:29.064 --> 27:32.151
without a care in the world.

27:32.276 --> 27:35.529
And I kept thinking...

27:35.653 --> 27:40.326
"Adrianna, you're never
gonna be like them again."

27:40.451 --> 27:43.787
I have a kid

27:43.912 --> 27:48.083
or I have an abortion.

27:48.208 --> 27:51.837
Either way...

27:51.962 --> 27:55.215
how am I ever gonna fly
a kite again?

27:55.341 --> 27:58.177
You know
what I mean?

28:00.387 --> 28:02.389
I mean, it's not like
we fly kites, but...

28:02.515 --> 28:06.018
Flying kites is always
an option.

28:06.143 --> 28:07.269
Anyway,
I was driving

28:07.394 --> 28:09.896
and driving, and then somewhere
around Big Sur,

28:10.022 --> 28:11.815
I almost got killed.

28:11.940 --> 28:13.942
What? What happened?

28:14.067 --> 28:16.987
A car accident
or this almost accident.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.030
My God, are you okay?

28:18.155 --> 28:19.657
(sniffles)

28:19.781 --> 28:25.162
I pulled over, and suddenly
it hit me, you know?

28:25.287 --> 28:28.999
Like, I... I have to take
control of the situation.

28:29.124 --> 28:31.210
I have to make a choice.

28:31.335 --> 28:33.295
And I ended up going

28:33.420 --> 28:34.505
to this woman's clinic

28:34.630 --> 28:36.465
that my hairdresser
was talking about.

28:36.590 --> 28:39.134
I saw a doctor, and...

28:39.259 --> 28:42.346
Did, did you...?

28:42.471 --> 28:46.141
I couldn't. I can't.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.810
(sighing):
Honey, I understand.

28:48.935 --> 28:50.396
Honestly, I don't think
I could either.

28:50.521 --> 28:52.356
I mean, it's one thing
to talk about it, but...

28:52.481 --> 28:54.816
I can't.

28:54.941 --> 28:56.985
I'm too far along.

28:57.110 --> 29:00.489
It's not legal,
it's not possible.

29:00.614 --> 29:03.075
Abortion just isn't an option.

29:06.828 --> 29:09.873
Whether I like it or not,
I'm having this baby.

29:28.100 --> 29:29.351
Hey, Dad, can you move your car?

29:29.476 --> 29:31.520
You blocked me in again.

29:31.645 --> 29:34.356
Okay, but park in the street
when you get back, will ya?

29:34.481 --> 29:36.609
I'm tired of moving
my car every half
an hour.

29:36.734 --> 29:40.362
Um, yeah, actually,
I'm not coming back.

29:40.487 --> 29:41.863
I reserved a hotel suite.

29:41.988 --> 29:43.532
I'm gonna stay there
until Mom comes home.

29:43.657 --> 29:44.533
No.

29:44.658 --> 29:46.201
Yes.
Naomi,

29:46.326 --> 29:47.911
I am your father.
There is no option.

29:48.036 --> 29:48.912
Yeah,

29:49.037 --> 29:51.707
technically you're my father,

29:51.831 --> 29:54.042
but you haven't been much
of a parent, have you?

29:54.167 --> 29:56.169
You haven't earned the right
to parent me.

29:56.295 --> 29:58.004
I mean, there's teenagers
straight out of rehab

29:58.130 --> 29:59.715
who can't even afford
a cup of coffee

29:59.839 --> 30:01.133
who'll make better parents
than you.

30:01.258 --> 30:02.593
You can't talk to me like that.

30:02.718 --> 30:06.221
I went by the house yesterday
to pick up my jeans

30:06.346 --> 30:09.433
around 3:00 p.m.

30:09.558 --> 30:11.226
You know, I don't see how

30:11.351 --> 30:14.229
that lovely broker of ours
is ever gonna sell that house

30:14.354 --> 30:18.150
if you keep her tied up with
all your pointless busy work.

30:18.275 --> 30:20.569
I'm your father.

30:20.694 --> 30:23.196
I don't need a father anymore.

30:23.322 --> 30:24.906
But thanks.

30:26.283 --> 30:28.827
Oh, but I do need you
to move your car.

30:39.254 --> 30:40.339
You wanted to see me?

30:40.464 --> 30:42.341
Read your paper.

30:42.466 --> 30:43.342
Oh, yeah?

30:43.467 --> 30:45.051
Yep.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.219
And?

30:46.345 --> 30:47.554
I mean, uh...

30:47.680 --> 30:48.972
Did you like it?

30:51.391 --> 30:52.643
It's not bad.

30:54.436 --> 30:56.896
It was insightful.

30:57.022 --> 30:57.897
It's ambitious.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.525
I liked knowing

30:59.650 --> 31:02.361
that you read the book.

31:02.486 --> 31:05.113
I liked knowing that it
meant something to you,

31:05.238 --> 31:07.157
and I liked reading
what you thought.

31:08.367 --> 31:09.409
Thanks.

31:09.535 --> 31:12.287
Well...

31:12.412 --> 31:14.122
Thank you...

31:14.247 --> 31:16.166
for...

31:16.291 --> 31:18.043
making me want
to stay up all night

31:18.168 --> 31:19.211
getting carpal tunnel.

31:19.336 --> 31:21.296
(laughing)

31:21.421 --> 31:23.632
Glad you liked the book.

31:23.757 --> 31:25.342
Yeah. It was pretty kick-ass.

31:27.594 --> 31:29.137
You know, you might cut down

31:29.262 --> 31:31.807
on some of the enthusiastic
colloquial adjectives

31:31.931 --> 31:34.309
that you seem to be so fond of--
"kick-ass", "bad-ass"...

31:34.434 --> 31:35.602
anything with an "ass"
in it, really.

31:35.728 --> 31:37.437
Just, you might
try finding

31:37.563 --> 31:39.147
a synonym next time.

31:39.272 --> 31:40.440
Next time?

31:40.566 --> 31:42.609
Yeah.

31:42.735 --> 31:45.987
So... I'm back in your class?

31:47.406 --> 31:49.575
Cool.

31:49.700 --> 31:51.034
I'll get a thesaurus.

31:55.163 --> 31:56.582
(throat clearing)

31:56.707 --> 32:00.001
Thanks to everyone
who auditioned,

32:00.126 --> 32:02.254
and kids, no crying. Please.

32:02.379 --> 32:04.214
At least until I'm
out of hearing range.

32:09.302 --> 32:10.512
Huh. Charmian?

32:10.637 --> 32:11.847
It's a pretty good part.

32:11.971 --> 32:13.390
You're Cleopatra's
favorite servant girl,

32:13.515 --> 32:14.600
and you get to
die at the end.

32:14.725 --> 32:17.018
Wonderful.
Just wonderful.

32:17.143 --> 32:18.604
Congrats! You got a part, dude.

32:18.729 --> 32:20.439
I did? No way.

32:20.564 --> 32:23.149
Hey. Hey. Move.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.110
Mm...

32:25.235 --> 32:27.195
Mardian the Eunuch?

32:27.320 --> 32:28.280
All right.

32:28.405 --> 32:30.407
You auditioned?

32:30.532 --> 32:32.284
Yeah. Well, I mean, I figured...

32:32.409 --> 32:33.744
a little bit of public sweating
probably wouldn't hurt me.

32:33.869 --> 32:35.495
Plus, I mean, we
get to hang out.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.205
We can do the whole...
backstage thing.

32:37.330 --> 32:38.457
Yeah, yeah.

32:38.582 --> 32:40.208
Are you okay?

32:40.333 --> 32:41.543
Yeah.

32:41.668 --> 32:44.045
Hey. Who got Cleopatra?

32:44.170 --> 32:45.422
Who else?

32:45.547 --> 32:46.924
KELLY:
Adrianna.

32:47.048 --> 32:48.801
Whatever you need,
whenever you need it,

32:48.926 --> 32:51.386
I'm here. You can call,
text, knock on my door

32:51.511 --> 32:52.471
at 3:00 in the morning.

32:52.596 --> 32:55.223
Thank you.

32:55.348 --> 32:58.059
I'm, I'm sorry
if I was rude before.

32:58.184 --> 33:00.270
I just...

33:00.395 --> 33:02.105
Can I blame it on hormones?

33:02.230 --> 33:03.482
I am a high school
guidance counselor.

33:03.607 --> 33:05.024
I'm used to abuse.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.234
So, first step,

33:06.359 --> 33:07.778
she's going to need
some medical info.

33:07.903 --> 33:09.738
Um... I guess you could be
helpful in getting her

33:09.863 --> 33:11.949
into some kind of support group,
maybe for teenage moms.

33:12.073 --> 33:13.742
Obviously we have
to find a good doctor.

33:13.867 --> 33:15.494
I want her to have
the best OB/GYN in town.

33:15.619 --> 33:17.621
Mm. That's nice.

33:17.746 --> 33:19.080
Only the best for you, baby.

33:19.205 --> 33:20.791
Platinum speculum
all the way.

33:20.916 --> 33:21.667
KELLY:
I'll make some calls.

33:21.792 --> 33:23.961
Mm-hmm.
Adrianna,

33:24.085 --> 33:26.546
the doctor is gonna want to
know who the father is--

33:26.672 --> 33:29.257
you know, for hereditary
health reasons.

33:29.382 --> 33:32.093
Okay.

33:32.218 --> 33:33.219
Sure.

33:33.345 --> 33:36.306
So, you conceived before
you went into rehab,

33:36.431 --> 33:37.766
right?

33:41.645 --> 33:43.396
Hank isn't the father.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.398
Wait. What?

33:45.524 --> 33:46.733
Then who?

33:46.859 --> 33:50.195
There's only
one guy it could be.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.613
Guess who?

33:55.325 --> 33:56.785
ADRIANNA:
Ty. Hi.

33:56.910 --> 33:58.495
TY:
Antony
to your Cleopatra.

33:58.620 --> 33:59.872
Congrats.

34:02.499 --> 34:04.543
TY:
Um...

34:04.668 --> 34:05.752
See you at the dinner.

34:29.234 --> 34:30.735
Uh... hon, there's
a light right there.

34:30.860 --> 34:32.529
I know.

34:36.824 --> 34:38.284
(knocking)

34:38.409 --> 34:39.494
ETHAN:
Annie?

34:43.790 --> 34:45.123
Hey. The door was open.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.210
Whoa...

34:47.335 --> 34:49.379
That's a casual look.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.005
Hey. Uh... You know,

34:51.130 --> 34:55.594
I'm really not up for the
cast and crew dinner thing.

34:55.719 --> 34:57.637
Oh. I thought the whole point
of me doing this play

34:57.763 --> 34:58.638
was so we could
hang out together.

34:58.764 --> 35:01.140
I'm sorry.

35:01.266 --> 35:02.225
Come on. It's
gonna be fun.

35:02.350 --> 35:03.852
An Egyptian restaurant.

35:03.977 --> 35:07.522
I don't even really know
what Egyptian cuisine entails.

35:07.647 --> 35:08.690
Couscous.

35:08.815 --> 35:10.525
I'm guessing couscous.

35:10.650 --> 35:13.445
You go ahead.

35:13.570 --> 35:14.780
You don't mind?

35:14.905 --> 35:16.823
Seriously, go. Have fun.

35:16.949 --> 35:18.575
Hey.

35:18.700 --> 35:20.326
You know you're my
leading lady, right?

35:42.015 --> 35:42.891
Well, well, well,

35:43.016 --> 35:44.726
the notorious

35:44.851 --> 35:46.019
Ryan Matthews.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.854
I see my reputation
precedes me.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.481
Welcome to
West Beverly.

35:49.606 --> 35:50.857
Thank you.

35:50.983 --> 35:52.150
Damon, congrats
on Enobarbus.

35:54.444 --> 35:55.570
So, wh-what brings you here?

35:55.695 --> 35:56.780
Ah, free food.

35:56.905 --> 35:57.823
You know what teachers make.

35:57.948 --> 35:58.907
Can't really afford groceries.

35:59.032 --> 36:00.325
Thanks for that.

36:00.450 --> 36:02.744
Plus, I actually wanted
to talk to you. I, uh...

36:02.869 --> 36:05.831
I'm thinking of putting Antony
and Cleopatra on my syllabus,

36:05.956 --> 36:08.166
and I thought, you know, maybe
you could come to class

36:08.291 --> 36:11.252
an-and talk to the kids
from a director's point of view.

36:11.377 --> 36:15.298
Interdisciplinary. I like it.

36:15.423 --> 36:18.343
Sounds like you're a
very passionate teacher.

36:18.468 --> 36:19.761
What can I say?

36:19.886 --> 36:21.721
You know, you
can't reach these kids

36:21.847 --> 36:24.307
unless you're willing to go
out on a limb once in a while.

36:24.432 --> 36:27.644
Oh. A fellow
tree-climber, are you?

36:28.770 --> 36:30.188
(chuckles)

36:31.898 --> 36:32.941
I'm gonna get some schwarma.

36:33.066 --> 36:33.942
Oh.

36:34.067 --> 36:35.568
But I'll, I'll see ya.
Yeah.

36:35.694 --> 36:36.862
Yeah.

36:38.989 --> 36:40.532
Nice to meet you.

36:44.161 --> 36:46.245
Dixon! You're late!
What happened?

36:46.371 --> 36:47.580
Uh, Silver. I...
Doesn't matter.

36:47.706 --> 36:48.915
Did you hear?

36:49.041 --> 36:50.834
Ryan let me back
into his class.

36:50.959 --> 36:52.752
Yes, my amazing-paper
plan worked.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.420
I mean, that's great, but...

36:54.546 --> 36:55.755
And he loved it.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.924
He wouldn't stop going on
about how great the paper was.

36:58.050 --> 36:59.509
Cool. I...
I think the word

36:59.634 --> 37:01.553
"insightful" actually came up
once or twice. Insightful.

37:01.678 --> 37:03.429
Mm-hmm. Moi. Insightful.

37:03.555 --> 37:05.015
And then he actually
started telling me...

37:05.140 --> 37:07.350
You know,
for someone so insightful,

37:07.475 --> 37:08.810
you could be pretty dense.

37:08.935 --> 37:11.813
Sorry, what?

37:11.938 --> 37:14.482
(sighs)

37:14.607 --> 37:15.441
Mm!

37:15.567 --> 37:16.442
All right.

37:16.568 --> 37:17.861
Look.

37:17.986 --> 37:19.821
I know you're
not a mind reader.

37:19.946 --> 37:21.823
Ooh. You're on to me.

37:21.948 --> 37:23.783
Can I please just talk

37:23.909 --> 37:26.494
for one second
without being interrupted?

37:26.619 --> 37:29.455
Okay.

37:29.581 --> 37:30.957
All right.

37:31.083 --> 37:34.711
The fight that
we had at the beach.

37:34.836 --> 37:36.295
It freaked me out.

37:36.421 --> 37:37.714
You know...

37:37.839 --> 37:39.632
I know you're intense.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.134
And I, I get that.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.720
You have big moods
and a lot of them.

37:43.845 --> 37:44.721
You know?

37:44.846 --> 37:45.847
I get that.

37:45.972 --> 37:47.473
You're stormy.

37:47.599 --> 37:48.474
Mm-hmm.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.768
So?

37:58.193 --> 38:01.487
So I want to break up with you.

38:05.450 --> 38:06.492
What?

38:06.618 --> 38:10.329
I'm breaking up.

38:10.455 --> 38:11.623
It's over.

38:22.175 --> 38:24.636
Thank you.

38:24.761 --> 38:26.471
Thank you so much
for coming with me.

38:26.596 --> 38:29.849
Mm. No problem.

38:29.975 --> 38:32.894
I like theater
people, you know?

38:33.019 --> 38:34.729
Well, in small
doses, that is.

38:34.854 --> 38:36.815
(laughing)
The second some
actor dude

38:36.940 --> 38:38.024
comes up to me, and corners me

38:38.150 --> 38:39.276
and starts talking
about his "process,"

38:39.400 --> 38:40.819
I might have to duck
back to my hotel.

38:40.944 --> 38:42.612
Listen to you.

38:42.737 --> 38:44.614
"Duck back to my hotel."

38:44.739 --> 38:45.698
(laughing)

38:45.824 --> 38:47.200
I love saying it.

38:47.325 --> 38:50.078
It's the most beautiful phrase
in the English language.

38:50.203 --> 38:52.455
"Duck back to my hotel."

38:52.580 --> 38:54.082
(both laughing)

38:54.207 --> 38:55.458
But seriously,

38:55.583 --> 38:57.543
if you ever need to crash...

39:00.088 --> 39:01.506
What's wrong?

39:01.631 --> 39:03.800
Ty just walked in.

39:07.846 --> 39:09.097
NAOMI:
Ohh...

39:12.142 --> 39:14.227
Are you gonna talk to him?

39:16.855 --> 39:18.231
Eventually.

39:22.944 --> 39:23.987
(knock at door)

39:25.697 --> 39:26.531
Hey, honey.

39:26.656 --> 39:27.573
Hey.

39:27.699 --> 39:28.741
Whatcha doing?

39:28.867 --> 39:31.786
Just, uh, sitting here,
feeling like an idiot.

39:31.911 --> 39:32.829
DEBBIE:
Well,

39:32.954 --> 39:33.872
can we join you?

39:33.997 --> 39:35.456
I mean, for the sitting part.

39:40.586 --> 39:42.588
I really thought
I was gonna get the part.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.465
Mm.

39:44.590 --> 39:46.467
Annie, you got a part.

39:46.592 --> 39:48.678
You have a reason
to celebrate tonight.

39:48.803 --> 39:49.846
You know,

39:49.971 --> 39:51.973
once in college,

39:52.098 --> 39:54.433
I applied
for a summer photo

39:54.559 --> 39:55.560
internship at Vogue.

39:55.685 --> 39:57.603
I wanted it
so much, but...

39:57.729 --> 39:59.731
But you didn't get it,
and you ended up

39:59.856 --> 40:01.858
working at the local newspaper,
which turned out to be

40:01.983 --> 40:03.193
the best thing
that could have happened.

40:03.318 --> 40:05.904
Have I told you
that one before?

40:06.029 --> 40:06.821
It's an oldie... (patting)

40:06.946 --> 40:08.114
but a goodie.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.824
You know, sweetie,
the bottom line is

40:09.949 --> 40:10.950
you got beat.

40:11.076 --> 40:11.993
No shame, and that happens

40:12.118 --> 40:13.578
to even the best teams.

40:13.703 --> 40:15.454
Besides, Adrianna's lived here
her whole life,

40:15.580 --> 40:16.664
She's got
the home court advantage.

40:16.789 --> 40:17.790
Yeah.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.585
Well... thanks, you guys,

40:20.710 --> 40:22.254
but I don't know.

40:22.379 --> 40:26.049
I feel bummed out
that I didn't get the lead,

40:26.174 --> 40:28.385
and then I feel bummed out
that I'm the kind of person

40:28.509 --> 40:31.179
that gets bummed out
that they didn't get the lead,

40:31.304 --> 40:34.640
and then imagining
being at that party tonight

40:34.766 --> 40:36.935
and having to pretend
like I'm not bummed out...

40:37.060 --> 40:38.561
You get bummed out.

40:38.686 --> 40:41.147
Yeah. Especially if I'm worrying

40:41.273 --> 40:43.358
about not being
a good enough actress

40:43.482 --> 40:44.859
to hide that
I'm bummed out.
Oh! Hey.

40:44.984 --> 40:47.153
No. You are an amazing actress,

40:47.279 --> 40:49.655
and they will all think
you're thrilled to be there.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.824
I agree. In fact, I
think they'll think

40:51.950 --> 40:53.159
you didn't want to be
Cleopatra to begin with.

40:53.285 --> 40:54.619
Oh.

40:54.744 --> 40:55.745
Think of it as a challenge.

40:55.870 --> 40:59.207
Ugh. Why is life
so full of challenges?

40:59.332 --> 41:00.666
Because it's life.

41:02.668 --> 41:03.836
True.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.463
Hmm.
Very true.

41:06.881 --> 41:08.883
