00:19.787 --> 00:21.787
      (bell on door rings)
                   (stuffed up):
               Hello, everybody.

00:21.789 --> 00:23.789
        Guess who's got
    two thumbs and the flu?

00:23.791 --> 00:25.124
           This gal!

00:25.126 --> 00:26.525
       Feel my forehead!

00:26.527 --> 00:27.960
            Just feel it!
                 Feel it!

00:27.962 --> 00:29.862
Oh, yeah, you're on fire.

00:29.864 --> 00:32.031
            Uh-huh!
    She's half girl, half grill.

00:32.033 --> 00:34.033
                        All cop.
A really sick cop.

00:34.035 --> 00:35.868
             Oh, no, Louise, you
             caught that flu bug

00:35.870 --> 00:37.703
            that's going around?
                That's terrible.

00:37.705 --> 00:40.305
I know, such bad luck.
                            Ugh.

00:40.307 --> 00:41.974
It's interesting
how upbeat you are.

00:41.976 --> 00:44.309
Maybe 'cause you want
to miss school?

00:44.311 --> 00:45.644
     Father, how dare you.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.312
      But, gosh, now that
        you mention it,

00:47.314 --> 00:48.981
            I might
   have to miss some school.

00:48.983 --> 00:51.884
Man, too bad, I love that stuff.

00:51.886 --> 00:54.653
      Mm-hmm.
              Louise, you do not
              want that flu bug.

00:54.655 --> 00:57.056
            I had it and it gave
          me weird fever dreams.

00:57.058 --> 00:58.991
I dreamt I was in a book club
with my cousin Vanessa,

00:58.993 --> 01:01.326
but she was a werewolf.
                        Classic.

01:01.328 --> 01:03.862
   Well, I may have the flu,
  but I've never felt better.

01:03.864 --> 01:07.366
           (sneezes)
     Gene, celebration hug.
                             No!

01:07.368 --> 01:09.334
                    Tina...
    All right, I'll take one
       of those bad boys.

01:09.336 --> 01:11.036
                 Oh, yeah, yeah,
               yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, Tina, no!

01:11.038 --> 01:12.838
        (Louise coughs)

01:12.840 --> 01:14.506
    How's my little sick pickle?

01:14.508 --> 01:17.009
   Wow, that's quite a setup
       you got going on.

01:17.011 --> 01:18.177
Oh, yeah.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.845
 We got my buddy Bakeneko here,

01:19.847 --> 01:21.013
         Akkoro Kamui,

01:21.015 --> 01:22.748
     Dodomeki and Mizuchi.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.750
             I'm just gonna call
           them all Hello Kitty.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.552
           Now let's get you
          some medicine, huh?

01:26.554 --> 01:28.687
                 Uppity doodity,
        bup bup bup bup dit dit!

01:28.689 --> 01:30.889
           Right down the hatch.
Mmm.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.758
    Okay, I'll check on you
        in a little bit.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.026
            (spits)

01:34.028 --> 01:35.694
   Like I want to get better.

01:35.696 --> 01:37.696
      Hey, wait a minute,
         who's missing?

01:37.698 --> 01:39.765
          Kuchi Kopi.
         Gah, the Kuch.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.067
   He's only my favorite toy
         in the world.

01:42.069 --> 01:44.436
      If I had a favorite.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.072
         Which I don't.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.607
        (clears throat)

01:48.609 --> 01:50.275
 (air horn blares, all scream)

01:50.277 --> 01:52.444
    Jeez, I thought we took
  the air horn away from her.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.613
              Did you hide it in
          your underwear drawer?
              Yes.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.881
               We know about the
               underwear drawer.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.449
       And about your underwear.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.785
   Not-so-tighty-not-so-whities.
       (air horn blares)

01:59.787 --> 02:01.553
Coming!

02:01.555 --> 02:02.754
       (air horn blares)
               Okay, okay, okay.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.723
Oh, good, you heard that.
             Yeah.

02:04.725 --> 02:07.593
  Listen, would you be a lamb
    and bring me Kuchi Kopi?

02:07.595 --> 02:10.062
    I would get him myself,
 but I'm just so sick and weak.

02:10.064 --> 02:12.397
          (fake cough)
       Sure, where is he?

02:12.399 --> 02:15.434
      In the bathroom next
         to the toilet.
        Why is he there?

02:15.436 --> 02:16.735
   If you must know, mother,

02:16.737 --> 02:18.270
     he is my doodie buddy.

02:18.272 --> 02:19.571
             Okay.

02:19.573 --> 02:21.240
   Well, I'll be right back.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.908
           (humming)
          There he is.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.910
          Whoa! Whoa!

02:24.912 --> 02:26.778
      (struggling noises)
            Oh, no.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.247
I dropped Kuchi Kopi
in the toilet

02:28.249 --> 02:29.414
and then I tried to rinse him
off in the sink

02:29.416 --> 02:30.749
and then I dropped him
in the toilet again

02:30.751 --> 02:31.750
and now there's a bunch of water

02:31.752 --> 02:33.085
   sloshing around in there.

02:33.087 --> 02:34.753
  Oh, Louise won't like that.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.421
    Yeah, Mom, that's, like,
      her favorite thing.

02:36.423 --> 02:37.923
        Don't you think
       I know that, Tina?

02:37.925 --> 02:39.424
Oh, my God, what do we do,
what do we do?

02:39.426 --> 02:40.592
              Well, we could put
                  rice around it

02:40.594 --> 02:41.593
         and put it in the oven.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.262
                            Yum.
    No, it might dry it out.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.930
   People do it with phones.
Hmm.

02:44.932 --> 02:47.166
        We should probably throw
         some ribs in there too.

02:47.168 --> 02:48.500
                   Just in case.
Mm.

02:48.502 --> 02:51.436
     Does anyone else feel
        kind of freezing

02:51.438 --> 02:52.938
       and, like, floaty?

02:52.940 --> 02:55.440
       (breathes deeply)
            Just me?

02:55.442 --> 02:57.609
      Ugh, where the hell
         is Kuchi Kopi?

02:57.611 --> 03:00.779
       (air horn blares)
Just a second.
(laughs nervously)

03:00.781 --> 03:02.447
Okay, it's at 100 degrees.

03:02.449 --> 03:04.283
So, how long does
this usually take?

03:04.285 --> 03:05.784
          30 minutes.
                     30 minutes?

03:05.786 --> 03:07.119
          That's a half an hour.

03:07.121 --> 03:08.787
                 Louise'll catch
            onto us before that.

03:08.789 --> 03:12.191
All right, look,
I know this oven pretty well.
Oven brag.

03:12.193 --> 03:14.459
So, I think if we just
turn it to 200 degrees

03:14.461 --> 03:16.662
for a few minutes,
it'll do the trick.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.130
       (air horn blares)
    Oh!

03:18.132 --> 03:19.298
I can't go in there by myself.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.799
You guys are coming with me.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.868
     What are we gonna tell her?
We just got to stall.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.037
      I could distract her
   with an intriguing dance.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.471
              Hmm?

03:26.473 --> 03:29.708
               Hey, sweetie.
         Hi.
                        Hi.
           Hey.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.977
              Hi.
    So, where's Kuchi Kopi?

03:31.979 --> 03:33.679
       Right, Kuchi Kopi.

03:33.681 --> 03:36.481
Yes.
             (Gene sings)

03:36.483 --> 03:37.816
                       Ooh!

03:37.818 --> 03:38.850
                 Look at him go.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.686
        That's so good.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.487
         Wait, Louise,
     is that your medicine?

03:42.489 --> 03:45.524
            Um, no.
            (gasps)
        You spit it out?

03:45.526 --> 03:48.560
              You're taking that
           medicine, miss missy.
         No, I am not.

03:48.562 --> 03:51.496
      Don't you make me do
   the full family hold down.

03:51.498 --> 03:53.532
       You wouldn't dare.

03:53.534 --> 03:55.367
  (all grunting and groaning)

03:55.369 --> 03:58.370
    How can she be so sick,
      but still so strong?

03:58.372 --> 03:59.738
       Like the economy!

03:59.740 --> 04:01.206
(Louise yells, then Linda yells)

04:01.208 --> 04:02.541
 Okay, that's a problem.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.843
     Oh, my God, the oven!
              ALL:
              Ah!

04:04.845 --> 04:07.045
      Oh, my God, the oven
        to you too, pal!

04:07.047 --> 04:09.214
            Oh, no,
    we left it in too long.

04:09.216 --> 04:12.050
  Maybe it'll be fine, though.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.386
                  It's not fine.
     I can fix it, I can fix it!

04:14.388 --> 04:15.687
              Ow!
           Hot Kuchi!

04:15.689 --> 04:17.555
Oh, we're dead.
We're dead.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.524
            Oh, God.
     We should just leave.

04:19.526 --> 04:20.559
             Town.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.694
Get in the car and go far away.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.062
      I'd love to see Ann Arbor.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.364
Okay, okay,

04:25.366 --> 04:27.232
uh, she's all loopy
right now, right?

04:27.234 --> 04:28.567
Maybe she won't notice?

04:28.569 --> 04:32.404
      Hi.
             Hello.
                   Hi there.

04:32.406 --> 04:34.039
(weakly):
You have... Kuchi Kopi?

04:34.041 --> 04:34.906
            Uh-huh.

04:34.908 --> 04:36.541
There he is.
Kuchi.

04:36.543 --> 04:37.876
       Okay, good night!
Good night.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.044
             Phew.

04:39.046 --> 04:41.380
       Good night, Kuchi.

04:41.382 --> 04:44.049
           (screams)
                        Oh, boy.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.717
(gibberish)
      It was an accident!

04:45.719 --> 04:47.219
  I dropped him in the toilet
       and then Tina said

04:47.221 --> 04:49.054
       we should put him
      in the oven and then

04:49.056 --> 04:51.790
Bob didn't really know the oven,
and then Gene smooshed his face,

04:51.792 --> 04:53.725
    so it's all our faults,
          right guys?

04:53.727 --> 04:54.726
                  Mm...

04:54.728 --> 04:56.395
         Louise, we're so sorry.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.730
       (angry breathing)

04:58.732 --> 05:01.566
Honey?
Say something.
            Get out.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.735
           Louise, I know you're
         really angry right now,

05:03.737 --> 05:05.404
               and it's a little
             early to, you know,

05:05.406 --> 05:07.906
        have some perspective on
     this and forgive us, but...

05:07.908 --> 05:10.142
    I will never forgive you
           for this.

05:10.144 --> 05:11.977
        Never ever ever!

05:11.979 --> 05:13.111
    How about-- what if I...

05:13.113 --> 05:14.746
            (sings)

05:14.748 --> 05:16.448
            Get out!
      Okay, okay!

05:16.450 --> 05:19.251
              ¶ ¶
That went... well.

05:19.253 --> 05:22.587
     I can't believe this.

05:22.589 --> 05:25.590
       ¶ I used to trust
          my family ¶

05:25.592 --> 05:28.260
             ¶ ALL:
    We're sorry, so sorry ¶

05:28.262 --> 05:31.630
       ¶ Now they're just
         a sham to me ¶

05:31.632 --> 05:34.599
        ¶ Did we mention
      that we're sorry? ¶

05:34.601 --> 05:37.936
 ¶ Destroyed my favorite thing
         in the world ¶

05:37.938 --> 05:40.439
  ¶ This wasn't our best day ¶

05:40.441 --> 05:43.475
       ¶ Broke the heart
     of this little girl ¶

05:43.477 --> 05:46.278
     ¶ You can slap us all
         in the face ¶

05:46.280 --> 05:50.115
      ¶ No amount of slaps
     can make this right ¶

05:50.117 --> 05:52.484
  ¶ Oh, no, that's not good ¶

05:52.486 --> 05:56.621
       ¶ I guess I'm not
     the forgiving type. ¶

05:56.623 --> 05:58.990
       Whoa, I'm feeling
        kind of flu-zy.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.625
 And the room is kind of woozy.

06:00.627 --> 06:02.327
 Was that rug always twirling?

06:02.329 --> 06:04.296
       'Cause it makes me
       feel like hurling.

06:04.298 --> 06:06.431
             Whoa!

06:09.670 --> 06:10.969
            (yells)

06:10.971 --> 06:13.372
            (grunts)

06:13.374 --> 06:15.374
              ¶ ¶

06:15.376 --> 06:17.642
             Whoa.
             Hello.

06:17.644 --> 06:19.978
  (both scream back and forth)

06:19.980 --> 06:21.380
    Wait, why are you screaming?

06:21.382 --> 06:23.482
I thought that was what
we were doing.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.217
                Well, let's not.
Okeydokey.

06:29.690 --> 06:32.190
            LOUISE:
 So I'm gonna go out on a limb

06:32.192 --> 06:35.360
    and say I may be having
         a fever dream.

06:35.362 --> 06:36.728
It's sort of gloomy.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.330
Is that 'cause I'm,
I don't know,

06:38.332 --> 06:39.664
mad at my family?

06:39.666 --> 06:41.066
Is that how fever dreams work?

06:41.068 --> 06:42.734
                 Hey, I say just
               have fun with it.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.836
Jeez.
I got to tell you, Kuch,

06:44.838 --> 06:46.171
it's kind of hard
to look at you.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.173
           Is it bad?
           It's bad.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.875
Not in the face, though, right?

06:49.877 --> 06:52.177
       Man, my family did
        a number on you.

06:52.179 --> 06:54.012
      We should kill them.
          Whoa, what?

06:54.014 --> 06:56.348
                       Too much?
         Hey, I just remembered.

06:56.350 --> 06:58.850
            I have a place here.
                   A time share.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.919
You have a time share
in my fever dream?

07:00.921 --> 07:03.355
 Yes, it's a beautiful fortress.
                          There!

07:03.357 --> 07:05.257
You can just see it.
                       Oh, yeah.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.025
                 Are you looking
             where I'm pointing?

07:07.027 --> 07:09.194
Yeah, it's, like,
the only fortress.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.563
               Right, but you're
              not reacting like,

07:11.565 --> 07:13.765
                "Whoa, that's an
           incredible fortress."

07:13.767 --> 07:15.534
It's very nice,
it's very nice.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.235
                       Anyway...

07:17.237 --> 07:18.570
  we should totally go there.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.071
    We can be alone, and...

07:20.073 --> 07:21.740
          (whispers):
      we'll be safe there.

07:21.742 --> 07:22.741
        Safe from what?

07:22.743 --> 07:24.042
             Safe from everyone.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.210
            No one will hurt us!

07:25.212 --> 07:26.545
Whoa.
                   Sorry.

07:26.547 --> 07:29.047
Yeah.
                 Okay, well, um,

07:29.049 --> 07:30.715
          yeah, let's get going.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.050
Sounds good.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.385
             LINDA:
       <i> Oh, this is awful!</i>

07:33.387 --> 07:35.554
          Yeah, Louise hates us!

07:35.556 --> 07:37.222
           I mean, probably me
          the least, but yeah.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.257
         (phone rings)
Hello?

07:39.259 --> 07:41.593
     Hey, Bob, it's Teddy.
      From the restaurant.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.228
     Are you watching this
     hockey game right now?

07:43.230 --> 07:45.230
           No, Teddy.
   Ah, well, I wish you were

07:45.232 --> 07:47.566
    'cause my cable's out, I
want to come over and watch it.

07:47.568 --> 07:49.234
    Look, i-it's not really
          a good time.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.902
      We're in the middle
       of a crisis here.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.405
   We kind of melted Louise's
    Kuchi Kopi night light.

07:53.407 --> 07:55.740
       But that's, like,
      her favorite thing.
        We know, Teddy.

07:55.742 --> 07:58.243
       Wait, Kuchi Kopi,
that's made out of vinyl, right?

07:58.245 --> 07:59.744
     I don't know, I guess.

07:59.746 --> 08:01.246
    Well, why don't I bring
        over my heat gun

08:01.248 --> 08:03.248
     and we try to fix it?
      You have a heat gun?

08:03.250 --> 08:04.916
Yeah, I use it to weld PVC pipe
         for plumbing.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.751
      I've definitely told
         you about it.

08:06.753 --> 08:08.954
       Makes me feel like
  you don't listen to me, Bob.
            Uh-huh.

08:08.956 --> 08:10.589
     Anyway, we can use it
       to mold Kuchi Kopi

08:10.591 --> 08:12.257
    back to his former self.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.759
     Also, maybe if you see
the heat gun, you'll remember it

08:14.761 --> 08:16.761
  the next time I bring it up
        in conversation.

08:16.763 --> 08:19.164
  All right, we're desperate,
        so come on over.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.800
Maybe we can put the hockey game
     on in the background.
          Bye, Teddy.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.502
Teddy's coming over and
he's bringing his heat gun.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.937
      Is that a euphemism
       for his ding dong?

08:25.939 --> 08:27.939
    It's got an open floor plan,

08:27.941 --> 08:29.441
     stainless steal appliances.

08:29.443 --> 08:31.276
                     It's just a
           really great fortress

08:31.278 --> 08:33.144
                 to go to to get
               away from it all.
           (rustling)

08:33.145 --> 08:34.613
Shh.
I think I heard something.

08:34.615 --> 08:35.679
            Don't tell me shush.

08:35.682 --> 08:36.982
         (Bob's voice):
        Halt down there!

08:36.984 --> 08:39.484
     You shall not-- whoa!
              Ow!

08:39.486 --> 08:40.784
             Oh...

08:40.787 --> 08:43.154
        (clears throat)
    Uh, you shall not pass.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.290
Bakeneko?
What's going on?

08:45.292 --> 08:49.160
          Louise, I cannot allow
     you to get to the fortress.
What? Why not?

08:49.162 --> 08:51.162
(whispers): He's so jealous he's
    not invited to the fortress.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.631
                  It's pathetic.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.466
           Because the fortress
              is an awful place.

08:54.468 --> 08:56.535
            I mean, who builds a
    fortress that blocks the sun

08:56.537 --> 08:58.470
            and makes everything
                dark and gloomy?

08:58.472 --> 08:59.504
                  Who does that?

08:59.506 --> 09:01.006
           Probably a cool dude.

09:01.008 --> 09:03.174
        ¶ That fortress
       is the worstest ¶

09:03.176 --> 09:04.709
              ¶ And I think it's
             kind of cursed us ¶

09:04.711 --> 09:06.177
                ¶ You can see it
               has immersed us ¶

09:06.179 --> 09:08.647
            ¶ In this darkness ¶
     Wow.

09:08.649 --> 09:09.881
    ¶ I built a beautiful ¶

09:09.883 --> 09:11.483
          (falsetto):
          ¶ Sun deck ¶

09:11.485 --> 09:13.885
   ¶ Up there in the trees ¶

09:13.887 --> 09:15.220
          ¶ (normal):
    You could bring a good ¶

09:15.222 --> 09:16.688
          (falsetto):
         ¶ Book there ¶

09:16.690 --> 09:18.690
 ¶ And feel the gentle breeze ¶

09:18.692 --> 09:20.859
           (normal):
      ¶ It had a lovely ¶

09:20.861 --> 09:23.895
          (falsetto):
    ¶ View of the vicinity ¶

09:23.897 --> 09:25.664
(normal): ¶ But then they built
     that fortress there ¶

09:25.666 --> 09:27.365
   ¶ And ruined it for me. ¶

09:27.367 --> 09:28.667
                       Kill him.
           What now?

09:28.669 --> 09:29.701
Well, ho-hold on.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.236
Look, Bakeneko,

09:31.238 --> 09:32.837
    you don't tell me where
       I can and can't go

09:32.839 --> 09:34.372
     in my own fever dream.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.707
       Why do you want to
        go there anyway?

09:35.709 --> 09:37.842
Well if you must know,
to be alone.

09:37.844 --> 09:39.544
       Pfft. That's dumb.
          You're dumb.

09:39.546 --> 09:41.212
     Your face is... dumb.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.881
(quietly):
My face is not dumb.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.716
Beat the bear.
        Bup bup bup bup bup bup.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.351
       (chuckles) I really don't
              want to fight you.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.687
     Ah, then let us pass.
           Okay, I'll fight you.

09:48.689 --> 09:51.056
         But I'll go easy on you
       because I'm so big and...

09:51.058 --> 09:53.725
        (Lousie grunts,
 Bakeneko groans, then wheezes)
         Okay, not bad.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.193
       All... you have...
                      (grunting)

09:55.195 --> 09:57.562
  to do... is let... us pass!

09:57.564 --> 10:00.565
    (high-pitched grunting):
I'm not... trying... my hardest.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.200
                    Ha!
Just so you know

10:02.202 --> 10:03.535
                         (yells)

10:03.537 --> 10:04.536
              Oh!

10:04.538 --> 10:07.238
Oh, okay, taking a quick break.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.240
Or you can just keep walking.
That's fine.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.743
           (mumbling)
        TEDDY: Sheesh. It really
                looks messed up.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.712
You sure you don't just
want to replace it?

10:13.714 --> 10:14.946
I know a toy guy.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.715
I mean, he's real.
He's not a toy.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.383
 No, no, no, no, no, no, Teddy,
You could probably get...

10:18.385 --> 10:20.552
     she loves this thing,
      maybe more than us.

10:20.554 --> 10:22.554
   Let's just try and fix it
      before she wakes up.

10:22.556 --> 10:24.222
   Linda, you got the mustard
      for the switch out?

10:24.224 --> 10:27.225
Yes, mustard, check, right here.
         This is full.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.060
          Is this even
 the same weight as Kuchi Kopi?

10:29.062 --> 10:30.128
                  Let me see it.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.397
                 (eating sounds)
                      Now it is.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.732
         Thanks, Gene.
                 You're welcome.

10:33.734 --> 10:36.635
    (Tina groans nervously)

10:37.738 --> 10:40.238
    (all gasp, Louise stirs)

10:40.240 --> 10:41.573
      (all sigh in relief)

10:41.575 --> 10:43.475
How about putting on
that hockey game, Bobby?

10:43.477 --> 10:44.909
If we keep it low?

10:44.911 --> 10:46.911
     That was so badass, Louise.

10:46.913 --> 10:49.414
                  You were like,
          "Oh, I shall not pass?

10:49.416 --> 10:51.316
   Well, then why am I passing?"
                      (chuckles)

10:51.318 --> 10:53.418
You hear that,
everyone that may or may not

10:53.420 --> 10:55.153
be in the swamp right now?

10:55.155 --> 10:57.455
          You don't want to mess
                 with this girl.

10:57.457 --> 10:58.790
                    No sir!

10:58.792 --> 11:01.593
  (both yell, creature growls)

11:01.595 --> 11:03.094
               (nervous chuckle)
    Hello, pretty swamp monster.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.463
        You didn't hear all that
           super cool trash talk

11:05.465 --> 11:07.766
         I said before, did you?

11:07.768 --> 11:09.834
           (growling)
          (screaming):
     Okay, I guess you did!

11:14.307 --> 11:17.108
    (Akkoro Kamui growling)
   Akkoro Kamui? Is that you?

11:17.110 --> 11:18.109
       (clearing throat)
             Yeah.

11:18.111 --> 11:19.444
           (coughing)
             Yeah.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.445
        (Linda's voice):
     Uh, yes, it's me. Hi.

11:20.447 --> 11:21.446
            LOUISE:
              Hi.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.448
  So, listen, none shall pass.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.283
    Gas. (makes fart noise)
         Just kidding.

11:25.285 --> 11:28.119
But yeah, n-none shall pass. No.
       (laughs nervously)

11:28.121 --> 11:30.455
      I can't let you get
   to that fortress, Louise.

11:30.457 --> 11:32.290
     It's a bad, bad place.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.659
      Allow me to explain.
          Here we go.

11:34.661 --> 11:36.628
        ¶ That fortress
       is the worstest ¶

11:36.630 --> 11:38.296
   ¶ And it's really kind of
          cursed us ¶

11:38.298 --> 11:40.699
¶ You can see it has immersed us
       in this darkness ¶

11:40.701 --> 11:42.467
   Yup. Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.702
       ¶ I threw the best
        swamp parties ¶

11:43.704 --> 11:45.370
        ¶ I'd serve wine
        and calamaris ¶

11:45.372 --> 11:47.372
   ¶ And we'd drink and drink
  and drink and drink and... ¶

11:47.374 --> 11:48.807
    Yup, got it, we got it.

11:48.809 --> 11:49.974
     Hold on, I'm not done.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.476
    ¶ And we drink and drink
       and drink and... ¶

11:51.478 --> 11:53.044
      Come on, everybody!
 ¶ Drink and drink and drink ¶

11:53.046 --> 11:54.379
     ¶ And drink and drink ¶
      A little repetitive?

11:54.381 --> 11:56.314
¶ And drink and drink all day! ¶

11:56.316 --> 11:58.049
¶ But then the fortress made it
        dark and cold ¶

11:58.051 --> 12:00.318
   ¶ And that is not okay! ¶
             Yeah!

12:00.320 --> 12:02.320
Um, Kuch? Quick side bar?
Sure.

12:02.322 --> 12:03.688
         (whispering):
      What's-- what's up?

12:03.690 --> 12:05.156
         (whispering):
     Everyone's got, like,

12:05.158 --> 12:07.158
    a major problem with me
    going to this fortress.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.993
      What? No they don't.

12:08.995 --> 12:11.062
     Well, I'm just saying,
maybe there's something about it

12:11.064 --> 12:14.499
that I'm not figuring out, or...
     like it's a metaphor.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.334
     Well, maybe we get to
          the fortress

12:16.336 --> 12:18.837
    and figure it out while
  we're sitting in the Jacuzzi

12:18.839 --> 12:20.839
  with eight jet streams, hm?

12:20.841 --> 12:22.240
Yeah, okay, fine.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.242
                   (whispering):
   What are we whispering about?

12:24.244 --> 12:25.677
Oh, hey Akkoro Kamui,

12:25.679 --> 12:26.845
come here,
I want to tell you something.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.213
             Okay.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.214
         Closer.

12:29.216 --> 12:30.515
                           Okay.
          Ha!

12:30.517 --> 12:31.750
          Ow, my face!

12:33.186 --> 12:34.352
         What-- Louise?
        Where'd you go?

12:34.354 --> 12:35.754
         Whatcha doin'?

12:35.756 --> 12:37.055
           Wha? Wha?

12:37.057 --> 12:40.024
    So long, Akkoro P.U.-y!

12:40.026 --> 12:41.926
High five.
           Ah, nuts.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.028
 Hey, kind of like a ponytail.

12:44.030 --> 12:46.364
    (dryer whirring, stops)

12:46.366 --> 12:47.866
         Okay... done.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.068
           TINA: Huh.
      You gave him boobs.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.536
             Boobs?
      Those are his arms.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.037
                          Mmm...

12:53.039 --> 12:55.039
     Look, this thing works
    much better on PVC pipe.

12:55.041 --> 12:56.374
  Any chance Louise would want

12:56.376 --> 12:58.710
     two pieces of PVC pipe
        welded together?

12:58.712 --> 12:59.944
                      (sighing):
    Look, it's all right, Teddy.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.279
                    Y-You tried.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.214
Well, may I suggest
going back to the plan

13:03.216 --> 13:04.382
where you just replace it?

13:04.384 --> 13:06.050
The toy guy's over on Hillcrest.

13:06.052 --> 13:08.553
Bob, that is right by
the all-night pharmacy.

13:08.555 --> 13:09.554
And we need more medicine,

13:09.556 --> 13:10.722
since some tricky little sicky

13:10.724 --> 13:11.923
knocked it out of my hand.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.725
            Won't this toy store
                      be closed?

13:13.727 --> 13:15.894
He'll open up for an emergency.
           How do you know that?

13:15.896 --> 13:17.562
   You know when you wake up
  in the middle of the night,

13:17.564 --> 13:19.063
and all you want is to look over

13:19.065 --> 13:20.899
      and see your little
         Mumaluma doll

13:20.901 --> 13:22.901
   that you suddenly remember
      from your childhood?

13:22.903 --> 13:24.903
                 N-- uh, no.
  And you call around looking,

13:24.905 --> 13:26.571
    'cause you just want to
     pull the little string

13:26.573 --> 13:29.774
 and hear that little guy say,
     "Mumaluma, Mumaluma."

13:29.776 --> 13:31.075
                     Mm.
           No? Nobody?

13:31.077 --> 13:32.076
                     No.
          "Mumaluma."

13:32.078 --> 13:33.077
                             No.
          "Mumaluma."

13:33.079 --> 13:34.279
    No one knows "Mumaluma."

13:34.281 --> 13:35.580
                          Sorry.
Stop saying that!
           Mumaluma!

13:35.582 --> 13:36.581
          No? Nothing?
             Not ringing a bell.

13:36.583 --> 13:37.582
No.
                          Sorry.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.285
        Anyway, finally,
  an angel answers your call,

13:40.287 --> 13:43.254
  and he's willing to open up
 his shop after hours for you.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.589
      That angel is Clyde.

13:44.591 --> 13:45.924
Wait, what's the toy say again?

13:45.926 --> 13:47.425
           Mumaluma!
No no no no no!

13:47.427 --> 13:50.495
  Man, I am so sick of my toys
       trying to stop me

13:50.497 --> 13:52.263
 from going where I want to go.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.332
                  Let's face it.
               Everybody stinks.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.100
           Except me. I'm great.
                      Hey, look.

13:56.102 --> 13:57.602
We are close.
        LOUISE: Finally!

13:57.604 --> 14:00.605
 Ugh, I just want to get there,
       put up my feet...

14:00.607 --> 14:01.773
       (engines revving)
      ...and oh, come on!

14:01.775 --> 14:04.142
          (Gene's voice): Hello.
(Tina's voice): Hi.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.944
Dodomeki, Mizuchi,
don't you dare!

14:05.946 --> 14:08.446
             What?
Don't say "you shall not pass"!

14:08.448 --> 14:10.114
              Uh, well then this
                will be awkward.

14:10.116 --> 14:12.283
'Cause you
shall not pass.
                           Yeah.

14:12.285 --> 14:15.453
Listen, you're not gonna stop us
 from getting to that fortress!

14:15.455 --> 14:17.355
                 Oh, speaking of
                 the fortress...

14:17.357 --> 14:19.457
             BOTH:
        ¶ That fortress
       is the worstest ¶

14:19.459 --> 14:21.192
No no no no no no!
   ¶ And it's really kind of
          cursed us ¶

14:21.194 --> 14:23.294
No songs about
why you hate the fortress.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.963
Just really-- just really quick.
          LOUISE: No!

14:24.965 --> 14:27.966
¶ Because I like to taaaaaan-- ¶
       Stop it! Stop it!

14:27.968 --> 14:29.367
                     Mm.
He really does.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.002
Just-- let's just fight already.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.804
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

14:32.806 --> 14:34.873
Time for our game faces.
Here's mine.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.140
(growling)

14:36.142 --> 14:37.642
              Okay, here's mine.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.177
                       (howling)

14:39.179 --> 14:40.178
Wow, that's good.

14:40.180 --> 14:41.379
      Yours is really good, too.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.513
I wouldn't want to fight us.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.148
                     Me neither,
               we're terrifying.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.850
We're so ready.
Okay, Louise.

14:45.852 --> 14:47.685
       (engines revving)
         Louise?

14:47.687 --> 14:49.220
       (Louise laughing)

14:49.222 --> 14:50.321
        So long, idiots!

14:50.323 --> 14:51.389
            (grunts)

14:51.391 --> 14:52.824
            Dammit!

14:52.826 --> 14:54.025
Uh-oh.

14:54.027 --> 14:55.860
So, um, do you know
the expression,

14:55.862 --> 14:59.163
"There's an army of angry toys
heading straight for us"?

14:59.165 --> 15:00.231
                     (screaming)

15:00.233 --> 15:01.699
Okay, yup, you do.

15:01.701 --> 15:04.035
       TEDDY: <i> Uh, thanks</i>
     <i> for doing this, Clyde.</i>

15:04.037 --> 15:05.737
   Yeah, sorry to put you out
           like this.

15:05.739 --> 15:08.072
I mean, you're in your bathrobe
          and it's...

15:08.074 --> 15:09.674
         What? This is a jacket.

15:09.676 --> 15:12.043
        Oh. But... okay.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.045
                     Oh, my God,
             this is a bathrobe.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.680
  That's what I thought, yeah.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.548
          I've been wearing this
        as a jacket for a while.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.350
It looks good.
          Really good.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.185
                      (sighing):
      Let me see the Kuchi Kopi.

15:21.187 --> 15:22.186
        Let me see him.

15:22.188 --> 15:23.187
      What happened here?

15:23.189 --> 15:24.389
    Did you give him boobs?

15:24.391 --> 15:25.523
             It was an accident.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.025
Those are clearly arms, Clyde.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.726
        Look, it's my daughter's
                   favorite toy.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.728
       Please, just help us out.

15:30.730 --> 15:33.564
      (sighs) So, I assume
   you know the books, right?

15:33.566 --> 15:35.867
        What-what books?
       "What books?" Wh--

15:35.869 --> 15:37.035
               Can I talk to you
              in private, Teddy?

15:37.037 --> 15:38.536
        Sure. What's up?

15:38.538 --> 15:39.570
  What are you bringing in here?
No, he's okay.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.039
 What are you bringing in here?

15:41.041 --> 15:42.240
No, he does...
Guy doesn't even know the books!

15:42.242 --> 15:43.741
He's okay!
The books, Bobby!

15:43.743 --> 15:45.410
He's talking about the books!
You know the books.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.245
      Oh, uh, the-- what?
      Yes, the books, I--
Right?

15:47.247 --> 15:49.047
                    Right? Yeah,
           the Kuchi Kopi books.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

15:49.049 --> 15:50.048
         You know all about 'em.
   Sit down.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.382
             What?

15:51.384 --> 15:52.717
     I'm gonna read them to you.
                       Sit down.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.385
 Oh, no, w-we don't need to...

15:54.387 --> 15:56.721
  Also, I could just read them
        at home myself.

15:56.723 --> 15:57.722
 You won't do the voices right.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.223
           Sit down.
             Okay.

15:59.225 --> 16:01.059
     All right, here we go.
          Here we go.

16:01.061 --> 16:03.594
       (creature-voice):
It all started on a chilly night

16:03.596 --> 16:05.129
     in the enchanted land of...

16:05.131 --> 16:06.264
           (knocking)
WOMAN: Clyde! Clyde!

16:06.266 --> 16:07.799
Let me in!
It's an emergency!

16:07.801 --> 16:09.067
                        Oh, boy.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.768
I need that Tanuki Baby
I called about!

16:10.770 --> 16:12.403
                      I told you
                it's not in yet!

16:12.405 --> 16:14.272
Come on, I have an apartment
full of people,

16:14.274 --> 16:15.740
        and I told them
   that I have a Tanuki Baby,

16:15.742 --> 16:16.808
      and they were like,
"No you don't." And I was like,

16:16.810 --> 16:18.242
          "Yes I do."
   And they said, "Prove it."

16:18.244 --> 16:19.911
     And I said I had to go
 to the bathroom and here I am.

16:19.913 --> 16:22.080
     I have a Tanuki Mama.
       That's all I got.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.581
I'll take it!
                Fine, all right,

16:23.583 --> 16:24.749
    I'm coming, I'm coming,
          I'm coming.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.284
  Should we... sit here, or...

16:26.286 --> 16:27.919
           You stay!
                  Yep. Got it.

16:27.921 --> 16:29.253
        (Louise panting)

16:29.255 --> 16:32.156
Bad toys! Bad toys!

16:32.158 --> 16:34.292
          KUCHI KOPI:
I know it's not the right time,
  but great drawbridge, right?

16:34.294 --> 16:36.427
Yeah yeah, very nice.
We got to close it.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.462
      We got to close it!

16:37.464 --> 16:39.430
           (grunting)

16:39.432 --> 16:40.665
        (gear cranking)

16:41.634 --> 16:42.934
            LOUISE:
              Yes!

16:42.936 --> 16:44.435
        (Louise panting)

16:44.437 --> 16:46.771
  Ha! We made it! We're safe!

16:46.773 --> 16:48.606
    Safe from all you punks!

16:48.608 --> 16:49.941
  (Linda's voice):
        Punks?
     (Tina's voice): Ouch.

16:49.943 --> 16:50.942
                 (Gene's voice):
             I think we're nice.

16:50.944 --> 16:52.110
      You know what else?

16:52.112 --> 16:54.145
 I love this friggin' fortress!

16:54.147 --> 16:56.647
  I might just sing about it!

16:56.649 --> 16:58.950
  ¶ Inside of these four walls
           of stone ¶

16:58.952 --> 17:01.619
 ¶ I'm finally all on my own ¶

17:01.621 --> 17:04.155
 ¶ 'Cause nobody's gettin' in ¶
            (grunts)

17:04.156 --> 17:06.124
 ¶ No one's on the guest list ¶

17:06.126 --> 17:08.960
       ¶ The bouncers are
         my two fists ¶

17:08.962 --> 17:11.462
¶ No one's gonna hurt this gal ¶

17:11.464 --> 17:12.964
 ¶ 'Cause nobody's gettin' in ¶

17:12.965 --> 17:14.165
         Scat break down!

17:14.166 --> 17:16.300
        ¶ Skiddy bop-ba,
        skiddy bop-ooh ¶

17:16.301 --> 17:18.368
       ¶ Skiddy bop-bop,
        bop ba-bop ooh ¶

17:18.371 --> 17:19.971
      ¶ Scatting dat dat,
        da da da dah! ¶

17:19.973 --> 17:21.638
Excuse me.
Hello.

17:21.641 --> 17:24.142
What the... Who are you?

17:24.144 --> 17:26.676
      I'm Good Kuchi Kopi.
             What?

17:26.679 --> 17:28.445
       Oh, great. The time share
        people double-booked us.

17:32.986 --> 17:34.052
            LOUISE:
   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

17:34.054 --> 17:35.319
   If you're Good Kuchi Kopi,

17:35.321 --> 17:36.821
 then what does that make him?

17:36.823 --> 17:39.490
I mean, I don't really
want to say.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.325
Let's just say
I'm <i> good</i> Kuchi Kopi.

17:41.327 --> 17:43.661
   No no no no, he calls himself
                Good Kuchi Kopi.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.029
       It doesn't make him good.

17:45.031 --> 17:47.832
             I could call myself
            six-pack Kuchi Kopi,

17:47.834 --> 17:50.001
              it doesn't make me
                   have muscles!

17:50.003 --> 17:51.536
Yeah, you're looking good,
by the way.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.337
                    That is just
                so jerky of you.

17:53.339 --> 17:54.872
        You're Jerky Kuchi Kopi.

17:54.874 --> 17:56.007
You are.
                      You are!

17:56.009 --> 17:57.008
You are. You are.
                     You! You!

17:57.010 --> 17:58.009
     You are.
                   You are!

17:58.011 --> 18:00.411
What the hell is going on here?!

18:01.881 --> 18:03.047
    BOB: Wow, I had no idea
    how great Kuchi Kopi is.

18:03.049 --> 18:04.549
             TEDDY:
         He's amazing.

18:04.551 --> 18:06.350
          It's so cool how he's,
                  like, a spirit

18:06.352 --> 18:08.186
    that can be different things
            to different people.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.687
Like Tom Brady.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.856
              Clyde actually did
      a really good job reading.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.558
Yeah, he nailed
the Frog King.
                     Oh, my God,

18:13.560 --> 18:14.759
         the Frog King was good.
Yeah, right? Huh?

18:14.761 --> 18:16.027
That's very good.

18:16.029 --> 18:17.728
       Okay, so, what are
        you doing here,

18:17.730 --> 18:19.897
       "Good Kuchi Kopi"?

18:19.899 --> 18:21.732
       Besides killing the vibe.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.102
You don't get it yet,
do you Louise?

18:24.104 --> 18:25.770
What this place is?

18:25.772 --> 18:28.539
Why we've all been trying
to stop you from getting here?

18:28.541 --> 18:30.708
          No, I don't.
      But you can keep on

18:30.710 --> 18:32.610
   being mysterious about it,
          if you want.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.580
Closing yourself off
like this, Louise?

18:35.582 --> 18:39.750
Hm? Building angry walls
around yourself, Louise?

18:39.752 --> 18:41.719
You need to forgive
your family.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.388
   What? Oh, that's what this
         is all about?

18:44.390 --> 18:46.057
Well, the answer is no!

18:46.059 --> 18:47.892
Okay? I mean,
look what they did.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.727
Look at his face. He's hideous.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.395
  Okay, that's not necessary.

18:51.397 --> 18:54.899
 Forgiving your family would be
     good for you, Louise.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.734
 Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Not gonna do it.

18:56.736 --> 19:00.404
       ¶ You think living
      behind these walls ¶

19:00.406 --> 19:01.906
                        Stop it.
      No, I won't stop it.

19:01.908 --> 19:03.908
            The end. Great song.
     No, it's not the end.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.744
   ¶ Means you can't get hurt
            at all ¶

19:06.746 --> 19:07.745
                        (scoffs)
                       This guy.

19:07.747 --> 19:08.746
                Huh, am I right?

19:08.748 --> 19:10.148
        Shush. Be quiet.

19:10.150 --> 19:13.751
    ¶ But that just makes it
         dark outside ¶

19:13.753 --> 19:16.654
        Blah, blah, blah
      is what I'm hearing.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.824
    ¶ And only you can bring
         in the light ¶

19:19.826 --> 19:22.493
     Okay, how long is this
         going to go on?

19:22.495 --> 19:26.764
    ¶ There's just one thing
  that will make this right ¶

19:26.766 --> 19:28.599
      ¶ Push that button ¶

19:28.601 --> 19:30.334
      ¶ Push that button ¶

19:30.336 --> 19:34.605
 ¶ Become the forgiving type. ¶

19:34.607 --> 19:36.107
I don't remember that
being there.

19:36.109 --> 19:37.675
What kind of contractors

19:37.677 --> 19:39.644
would put in
a "destroy fortress" button?

19:39.646 --> 19:40.945
     It was a backup plan.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.446
           And also,
      I thought the place

19:42.448 --> 19:43.981
  needed something button-ish

19:43.983 --> 19:45.616
 right around here, someplace.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.952
Louise? No.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.020
No, no, no.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.454
Don't push the button, Louise.

19:50.456 --> 19:52.423
Louise, no!
Don't push the button!

19:52.992 --> 19:53.824
           Oh, crap.

19:53.826 --> 19:56.794
           (rumbling)

19:56.796 --> 19:58.129
                     Oh!

19:58.131 --> 19:59.530
              Oh!

19:59.532 --> 20:01.199
              ALL:
              Ah!

20:02.702 --> 20:03.968
              Oh!

20:03.970 --> 20:05.636
            ALL: Ah!
Jeez...

20:05.638 --> 20:08.673
 I just had the weirdest dream.

20:08.675 --> 20:09.974
         Wait a second.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.509
 W-Why does he look like that?

20:11.511 --> 20:13.311
        Why does anyone
      look like anything?

20:13.313 --> 20:15.313
          Look at Dad.
      What's up with that?

20:15.315 --> 20:18.015
 No, I mean, I thought you guys
       melted Kuchi Kopi.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.318
         Was that just
       part of my dream?

20:20.320 --> 20:22.053
Uh-huh.
                That's it. Yeah.
         Yep.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.822
      Uh, Mom, why are you
        holding mustard?

20:24.824 --> 20:26.324
           Uh, 'cause I love it.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.326
                      (gurgling)
              She gets it.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.861
        Huh. Dad, what's
       behind your back?

20:30.863 --> 20:33.497
         What?
This is just how I stand.

20:33.499 --> 20:34.699
 Isn't this how I stand?

20:34.701 --> 20:35.866
Yeah, like a matador.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.002
         Yup. He's our Dad-ador!

20:38.004 --> 20:39.170
              Aye, buddy?
               (slapping)

20:39.172 --> 20:40.671
                     Oops.
       BOB: Uh-oh.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.373
     Huh. So it did happen.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.175
         We're so sorry, Louise.

20:44.177 --> 20:45.876
       We're a bunch of sorry
          sons of bitches.

20:45.878 --> 20:46.911
         Gene.
                Sorry.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.246
               Anyway, you don't

20:48.248 --> 20:49.513
           have to say anything.
                 We just want...

20:49.515 --> 20:50.514
         I forgive you.

20:50.516 --> 20:51.882
       Wa-Wait, wha, wha?

20:51.884 --> 20:53.351
I said I forgive
you guys.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.386
            Oh, boy.
    She's still pretty sick.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.421
No, I mean it. I forgive you.

20:57.423 --> 20:58.923
Phew.
                           Oh...
           Oh, good.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.892
  Hey, when did old Kuchi Kopi
           get boobs?

21:01.894 --> 21:04.395
I mean, I knew this day
would come, but not so soon.

21:04.397 --> 21:05.396
                   Teddy did it.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.864
Well, I forgive him, too.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.899
Wow, you're a forgiving machine,
            Louise.

21:08.901 --> 21:11.068
     I am. Come on, give me
   something else to forgive!

21:11.070 --> 21:12.236
Gene, Tina! Go!

21:12.238 --> 21:14.405
                     Okay, uh...

21:14.407 --> 21:16.073
         Ugh. Oh, Gene!

21:16.075 --> 21:17.575
     That is unforgivable.

21:17.577 --> 21:18.743
It wasn't Gene.

21:18.745 --> 21:21.212
(chuckling):
Wow, Tina. I'm impressed.

21:21.214 --> 21:23.214
     LINDA: <i> All right, Bob,</i>
    <i> give her the medicine. </i>
