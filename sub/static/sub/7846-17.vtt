02:23.819 --> 02:25.302
Morning, Mr. McDuck!

02:25.369 --> 02:27.357
Oh, uh, good morning, Webbigail.

02:27.424 --> 02:28.527
Where's your granny?

02:28.594 --> 02:30.767
She didn't bring up
my nutmeg tea this morning.

02:30.834 --> 02:32.290
Oh, I can make your tea! Whoop!

02:32.357 --> 02:34.894
That's really not...
All right.

02:36.147 --> 02:38.338
- It's one droplet of...
- Milk!

02:38.503 --> 02:40.627
A light stir, not to fully
dissolve the nutmeg.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.075
Oh, and don't worry,
it's the same

02:42.142 --> 02:43.875
teabag we've been using
all month.

02:47.193 --> 02:50.385
Mmm! Ahh!
Taste the savings.

02:50.452 --> 02:54.187
- How do you know...
- Oh, I know everything about you.

03:07.797 --> 03:10.689
Um, wouldn't you rather be
with the boys?

03:15.445 --> 03:17.820
So, what are your thoughts
on sword horses?

03:17.887 --> 03:18.954
You know, unicorns.

03:19.021 --> 03:20.591
This book says
you've encountered one.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.687
Warrior poets that can
impale their enemies!

03:22.754 --> 03:24.228
Are they the best?

03:24.308 --> 03:26.077
Oh!
Want me to get your breakfast?

03:26.144 --> 03:28.650
Uh, I'll get it myself.

03:34.555 --> 03:36.441
Greats sacks of delirium!

03:36.508 --> 03:38.683
Maybe Donald tried to make
an omelet again?

03:38.750 --> 03:41.603
Impossible. He still hasn't figured
how to get out of the pantry.

03:47.613 --> 03:49.689
It can't be.

03:57.412 --> 04:00.797
Ooh, Agent 22 !
Wonderful. You're early.

04:00.864 --> 04:02.621
- We can begin with the...
- Director Von Drake!

04:02.688 --> 04:05.375
I've been reading the Black Heron
Case File. Very intriguing.

04:05.442 --> 04:07.449
According to our intelligence,
she's a real bad egg.

04:07.516 --> 04:09.221
Martial artist, robotics
engineer,

04:09.288 --> 04:10.723
and chemist-turned
counter-agent.

04:10.790 --> 04:13.845
- Yes, and apparent...
- Apparently she's after the last page

04:13.912 --> 04:15.589
of the legendary Great Book.

04:15.656 --> 04:18.826
The page was recently unearthed
at Castle Dunwyn.

04:19.411 --> 04:20.896
Right!
And it is said

04:20.963 --> 04:22.689
- to contain...
- It is said to contain

04:22.756 --> 04:23.836
a dangerous secret.

04:23.903 --> 04:26.180
Well, did you know that
she is working for...

04:26.247 --> 04:28.289
I bet you that FOWL
is behind this. That's the...

04:28.356 --> 04:30.152
- Fiendish Organization for World Larceny!
- Fiendish Organization for World Larceny!

04:30.219 --> 04:32.246
The page is up for auction
tonight here in London.

04:32.313 --> 04:33.902
Heron will make a play
for it then.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.449
Unless we can get it first.

04:35.516 --> 04:38.063
Well if you were so smart,

04:38.130 --> 04:42.045
you would know this is
an exclusive high-class auction.

04:42.153 --> 04:46.039
Luckily we have acquired
a VIP invitation,

04:46.106 --> 04:48.863
thanks to a wealthy
freelance operative.

04:48.930 --> 04:50.664
- Wait, what?
- Agent 22,

04:50.731 --> 04:52.770
meet your new partner:
McDuck.

04:52.837 --> 04:54.725
Scrooge McDuck.

04:58.731 --> 05:00.289
Ha-ha!
Had a late night

05:00.356 --> 05:02.235
catching that pesky
Jack the Tripper,

05:02.302 --> 05:04.186
and there was some celebrating
afterwards.

05:04.575 --> 05:06.522
You mind returning
these to the queen?

05:07.138 --> 05:11.248
Now, on to the super-secret
secret agent equipment.

05:12.294 --> 05:13.621
Already have a cane.

05:13.688 --> 05:15.975
Ho, ho, ho! Not like this.

05:16.114 --> 05:20.586
Meet the Von Drake
Action Cane PPK,

05:20.653 --> 05:23.809
equipped with a number
of unique gadgets,

05:23.876 --> 05:26.399
which if used not correctly

05:26.466 --> 05:27.883
could kill you instant...

05:27.950 --> 05:30.606
Yeah, I'm sure I'll figure it out.
Let's roll, 22!

05:30.673 --> 05:32.366
Adventure awaits!

05:32.929 --> 05:36.093
That was the "not correctly"
I was talking about.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.584
<i>...all-day marathon!</i>

05:38.821 --> 05:40.842
I'm off for a little trip.

05:40.909 --> 05:43.228
Uncle Donald's in the pantry
if you need anything.

05:43.295 --> 05:46.019
If I don't come back, it's been
a pleasure knowing you all.

05:46.086 --> 05:47.306
- Yeah, yeah.
- Uh-huh, sure.

05:47.373 --> 05:49.429
Shh!...

05:52.636 --> 05:53.742
So, where are we going?

05:53.809 --> 05:55.264
"We" are going nowhere.

05:55.331 --> 05:57.429
But you are going to save
Granny, aren't you?

05:57.496 --> 05:59.309
If she's in trouble,
I wanna help!

05:59.386 --> 06:01.996
She would want you
safe at home.

06:02.114 --> 06:03.621
That's final.

06:10.035 --> 06:11.191
Hmm.

06:11.478 --> 06:13.457
Ah! There you are.

06:13.524 --> 06:15.924
We'll be arriving
in a couple hours, Mr. McD.

06:15.991 --> 06:19.012
Remember, this trip needs to
remain a secret, Launchpad.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.010
No one should know
where we're going.

06:21.077 --> 06:22.614
Way ahead of you.

06:25.553 --> 06:28.223
Ready for some action, cane?

06:40.083 --> 06:41.983
What are you doing here?

06:42.050 --> 06:45.564
The action cane, that black
feather, those coordinates...

06:45.631 --> 06:49.313
That can only mean an Agent
22-McDuck spy adventure!

06:49.380 --> 06:51.973
Oh! With Granny missing, can I
be your partner on this one?

06:52.040 --> 06:53.225
Please give me a chance!

06:53.292 --> 06:54.490
I'm trained in espionage,

06:54.557 --> 06:56.963
counter-espionage, I'm super
good at secret-keeping...

06:57.030 --> 06:59.088
Hmm. We're too far
to turn back now,

06:59.155 --> 07:01.116
but you'll be safe on the sub.

07:03.378 --> 07:07.162
Sorry. Blindfold slipped.
Still no clue where we are.

07:07.998 --> 07:09.959
On second thought...

07:10.034 --> 07:11.169
I can come?

07:11.236 --> 07:13.434
First-ever
Webby-McDuck team-up!

07:13.501 --> 07:15.641
This is not
a normal adventure.

07:15.708 --> 07:18.069
You'll need
to follow my lead.

07:18.304 --> 07:21.827
Now, just follow my lead.
McDuck?

07:25.378 --> 07:27.572
Ladies and gentleman,
ladies and gentlemen,

07:27.639 --> 07:31.041
let's start our bidding with the
last page from the Great Book,

07:31.108 --> 07:33.923
a priceless artifact
for medieval enthusiasts.

07:33.990 --> 07:35.717
So, what's on it exactly?

07:35.784 --> 07:38.365
Alchemy. Formulas
for potions and elixirs.

07:38.432 --> 07:41.170
Legend has it that the high
priests of Castle Dunwyn

07:41.237 --> 07:44.455
were mentored by mystical
creatures from the nearby glen,

07:44.522 --> 07:46.713
creatures with untold powers.

07:46.780 --> 07:48.709
- Untold powers?
- Yes.

07:48.776 --> 07:51.279
If you believe that sort of thing.
FOWL seems to.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.275
How do you know
so much about all this?

07:53.342 --> 07:55.693
Untold chaos.
Dark artifacts.

07:55.760 --> 07:57.404
A man has his hobbies.

08:00.535 --> 08:02.814
There's Black Heron.
Stick to the plan:

08:02.881 --> 08:04.623
Outbid her, win the page.

08:06.465 --> 08:08.674
Shall we start the bidding
at 25,000 pounds?

08:08.741 --> 08:10.139
Do I have 25?

08:10.507 --> 08:12.596
21. Do I hear 50,000?

08:12.663 --> 08:14.311
We are at 50,000.

08:14.989 --> 08:16.725
And 60,000.

08:16.792 --> 08:19.225
70,000. Do I hear
80 anyone? You, sir,

08:19.292 --> 08:20.842
the sweaty grump in the derby?

08:21.049 --> 08:22.522
What are you doing? Bid!

08:22.840 --> 08:26.186
The agency only gave me 60,000.

08:26.368 --> 08:28.304
What, you expect me to
chip in myself?

08:28.371 --> 08:30.279
You are a billionaire!

08:30.346 --> 08:33.392
And sold for 70,000
to the lovely young woman

08:33.458 --> 08:36.376
who appears to be
jumping out the window.

08:43.956 --> 08:46.465
- And now we can
steal it from her for free!

08:46.532 --> 08:48.294
I just saved SHUSH
a lot of money.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.324
You're welcome. Aah!

08:57.605 --> 09:01.382
I know you think this is just a fun
little excursion, but listen...

09:01.449 --> 09:03.770
Yep. Super serious.
Got it.

09:07.726 --> 09:10.215
Aw! Look at its jaunty hat!

09:10.282 --> 09:13.054
Pip, pip to you, mysterious orb!

09:13.121 --> 09:14.707
Webbigail, quiet!

09:31.483 --> 09:32.796
Protocol 414.

09:32.863 --> 09:35.406
Don't arouse suspicion.
Maintain camouflage.

09:38.114 --> 09:40.450
The lair's guard.
It spotted us.

09:40.517 --> 09:41.898
That thing?

09:42.397 --> 09:44.583
Don't underestimate
its adorable appearance.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.716
It's actually...
an elite killing machine,

09:46.783 --> 09:49.047
not some
adorably jovial globule.

09:50.428 --> 09:51.444
I know!

09:51.512 --> 09:54.234
That's a vintage series 2
Troububble C-20!

09:54.301 --> 09:55.593
Filled with Incendium!

09:55.660 --> 09:57.433
It'll ignite anything
it lands on.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.381
So cool!

09:59.449 --> 10:02.206
You know, most kids wouldn't get
this excited about impending doom.

10:02.273 --> 10:04.601
Louie mostly just cries.

10:09.439 --> 10:10.680
What are you...

10:11.335 --> 10:15.195
Gassing it.
From Incendium to helium!

10:17.475 --> 10:20.453
I haven't seen a maneuver
that impressive since...

10:22.101 --> 10:24.117
Next time, read the file.

10:24.184 --> 10:27.086
If you know your situation, then
you know how to conqueror it.

10:27.266 --> 10:30.299
- Wh-What is it?
- Strange berry bushes.

10:30.366 --> 10:32.312
They don't look native
to the island.

10:32.608 --> 10:34.180
Could be poisonous.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.541
They weren't.

10:36.608 --> 10:39.599
What is wrong with you?
There are rules! Protocol!

10:39.666 --> 10:41.135
Loosen up, 22!

10:41.202 --> 10:43.363
Ya gotta be willing to make
things up as you go along.

10:43.430 --> 10:46.273
I didn't get this far in life
by following the rules.

10:48.677 --> 10:50.871
Great.
And now you're dying.

10:50.938 --> 10:53.765
Worse. I got a stem
caught in my throat.

10:54.030 --> 10:55.617
Anyway, onward.

11:08.404 --> 11:09.850
What is it now?

11:09.917 --> 11:12.440
Should we have a battle cry
to strike fear in our enemies?

11:12.507 --> 11:13.921
What do you have in mind?

11:13.988 --> 11:17.077
Get ready to lose bad,
baddies!

11:17.927 --> 11:19.671
Eh, what she said.

11:19.841 --> 11:22.233
Just had to yell
a battle cry, didn't you?

11:27.935 --> 11:31.147
Come on, ya blasted bucket of bolts,
let's wallop!

11:40.402 --> 11:41.826
Ha!

12:07.899 --> 12:10.213
Good show, 22.

12:16.462 --> 12:19.534
Aw. That was going to be
so impressive.

12:19.715 --> 12:21.040
Anyway, shall we?

12:21.107 --> 12:22.836
We have to chase after
that last robot.

12:22.903 --> 12:25.311
- No loose ends.
- Bah. We won't be seeing him again.

12:25.378 --> 12:29.034
How are you still functioning?

12:31.460 --> 12:32.797
Hyah!

12:36.165 --> 12:37.384
Ha-ha!

12:37.676 --> 12:39.807
Anyway, shall we?

12:41.595 --> 12:46.049
Ah! Ugh! This is worse
than when they were alive.

12:47.798 --> 12:49.478
Hyah!

12:50.006 --> 12:52.333
Impressive.
All those years in my house,

12:52.400 --> 12:54.282
we should have done something
like this sooner.

12:54.349 --> 12:56.255
Granny always told me
to never bother you.

12:56.322 --> 12:58.475
If you wanted to do something,
you'd come to me.

12:58.542 --> 13:01.532
But you were always so busy with
your business and your grumbling.

13:01.599 --> 13:04.801
But I was busy too. With Granny's
training and my research

13:04.868 --> 13:08.213
about you, so, you know, we both
had our own things going on.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.039
I guess you could say
I've been prepping

13:10.106 --> 13:13.971
for a McDuck-Agent 22
adventure my whole life.

13:14.501 --> 13:16.455
You know so much about me,

13:16.522 --> 13:18.615
and I feel I know
so little about you.

13:18.682 --> 13:20.643
Oh come on.
You know about me.

13:20.710 --> 13:23.362
Like, my favorite color is...

13:25.829 --> 13:28.715
Pink! And my favorite
booby trap is spike pits.

13:28.782 --> 13:31.442
Favorite storm is tropical
cyclone meets thunder snow.

13:31.509 --> 13:34.340
I know your favorite drink...
Nutmeg tea.

13:34.407 --> 13:37.684
But I saw you down a whole
pot not this morning.

13:37.751 --> 13:40.219
Ah. Oh, no. That...
that was just to impress you.

13:40.286 --> 13:42.073
I kind of can't stand it.

13:42.392 --> 13:43.995
Juice, you say?

13:44.185 --> 13:46.745
I'll get it right next time.
I promise.

13:55.232 --> 13:58.479
Heron's lab.
McDuck, where are you?

13:58.647 --> 14:00.056
McDuck?

14:10.212 --> 14:12.549
What do we have here?

14:16.368 --> 14:19.045
<i>Good afternoon, world leaders.</i>

14:19.112 --> 14:21.703
<i>This is Black Heron of FOWL.</i>

14:21.770 --> 14:24.104
<i>Regrets if you haven't
heard of me.</i>

14:24.323 --> 14:28.356
But I've gotten very well
acquainted with your Agent 22.

14:28.423 --> 14:30.096
- Huh?
- After meticulous...

14:30.163 --> 14:32.213
My back molar is rigged
with a distress signal.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.678
SHUSH will be coming for me...
and you, Heron.

14:34.745 --> 14:37.470
Excuse me.
I'm in the middle of filming

14:37.537 --> 14:39.817
my declaration
of harmful intent.

14:39.915 --> 14:41.252
Where was I?

14:43.953 --> 14:46.684
<i>Oh, yes! After meticulous,</i>

14:46.751 --> 14:48.352
<i>frankly ingenious planning,</i>

14:48.419 --> 14:51.669
<i>I have obtained history's
greatest biological weapon.</i>

14:51.736 --> 14:54.373
<i>With the completed formula,
I will breed an army</i>

14:54.440 --> 14:57.130
<i>of super soldiers
that will bounce</i>

14:57.197 --> 14:59.428
<i>to the highest peaks
of corruption.</i>

14:59.495 --> 15:01.551
<i>Did you just say "bounce"?</i>

15:01.618 --> 15:03.692
<i>Who is this? Is he with you?</i>

15:03.759 --> 15:06.592
<i>- Unfortunately.
- You're making a bounce serum?</i>

15:06.659 --> 15:09.903
<i>The untold powers of the
ancient creatures is bouncing?</i>

15:09.970 --> 15:13.292
<i>Yes! There'll be bouncing
here and there and everywhere.</i>

15:13.359 --> 15:15.987
<i>Mass destruction
that's beyond compare!</i>

15:17.486 --> 15:19.182
<i>Stop laughing!</i>

15:19.249 --> 15:21.271
<i>I have wasted
an entire reel of film,</i>

15:21.338 --> 15:23.752
<i>and you're not even
entirely in frame!</i>

15:23.829 --> 15:25.158
<i>What are you doing? </i>

15:25.225 --> 15:27.479
Fighting a deadly super-villain,
apparently.

15:27.548 --> 15:29.588
<i>You're out of your league!</i>

15:35.126 --> 15:39.151
- I could try -a coupling gambit, or...
- 22 ! Little help?

15:39.218 --> 15:41.297
- I'm working out a plan.
<i>- I've got a plan:</i>

15:41.364 --> 15:43.682
<i>Just do something!</i>

15:44.013 --> 15:47.549
But... But how did you
defeat Black Heron?

15:47.758 --> 15:49.315
He didn't.

15:50.126 --> 15:52.244
Where's my Granny?

15:52.311 --> 15:54.290
Easy, lass.
This one's out of your league.

15:54.357 --> 15:56.185
Nobody's out of our league,
Mr. McDuck!

15:56.252 --> 15:57.963
We can take her!

15:59.195 --> 16:01.081
Webby! We need to...

16:09.687 --> 16:13.284
Wake up. Wake up.
Wake up!

16:15.986 --> 16:17.377
I can't believe you.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.078
What is
my granddaughter doing here?

16:19.145 --> 16:22.818
On a shush assignment, of all things!
She's just a little girl!

16:22.885 --> 16:24.467
- I know!
- Silence!

16:24.534 --> 16:27.252
I've waited so long
for this, 22.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.575
Decades lying in hiding,

16:29.642 --> 16:31.198
tracking you down,

16:31.265 --> 16:34.752
rebuilding this place,
rebuilding myself.

16:34.829 --> 16:37.924
But this time, 22,
I'm better prepared.

16:38.078 --> 16:40.203
World domination can wait.

16:40.270 --> 16:41.509
This...

16:41.604 --> 16:44.042
This is sweet revenge.

16:44.375 --> 16:47.103
Now, tell me the formula.

16:47.322 --> 16:48.692
It was years ago.

16:48.759 --> 16:50.826
How am I supposed
to remember? Wait.

16:50.893 --> 16:52.294
What are you...

16:52.650 --> 16:54.411
Come, come, 22.

16:54.478 --> 16:57.901
Protocol dictates you memorize
all mission-related data,

16:57.968 --> 17:00.510
and you're even more
fastidious than I am.

17:00.589 --> 17:04.375
So you have 3 tenths
of a second to respond, or...

17:04.442 --> 17:06.237
Don't do it!

17:06.509 --> 17:08.143
Six handfuls of red berries,

17:08.210 --> 17:10.002
four orange berries,
three purple berries,

17:10.069 --> 17:11.688
four blue berries,
three green berries

17:11.755 --> 17:14.828
and one yellow berry,
in that order.

17:14.895 --> 17:16.259
Bentina...

17:27.564 --> 17:31.248
Finally, the powers
of the ancients are mine.

17:31.315 --> 17:33.054
You're deranged, Heron.

17:33.121 --> 17:36.061
Would you please
not interrupt...

17:36.864 --> 17:38.060
No, no, 22.

17:38.127 --> 17:40.337
You won't throw me off
my game this time.

17:40.404 --> 17:43.459
I'm prepared for
every eventuality.

17:43.557 --> 17:45.215
Now, the child was a bit
of an X-factor,

17:45.282 --> 17:47.781
but she will be the cherry
on this sweet revenge.

17:47.848 --> 17:50.509
Leave her outta this, Heron.
She's just a defenseless girl.

17:50.576 --> 17:51.626
She has no place here.

17:51.693 --> 17:53.769
A damsel in distress is
what she is!

17:53.836 --> 17:56.795
It was a mistake to bring
a hapless hellion!

17:56.862 --> 17:59.564
She should be at home,
with her pink bows,

17:59.631 --> 18:02.971
enjoying a glass
of her favorite tea.

18:03.038 --> 18:05.568
I don't like tea, I like...

18:07.675 --> 18:09.698
This bores me.

18:09.765 --> 18:12.764
Time to move on
to the revenging.

18:22.324 --> 18:23.933
What are you, child?

18:24.000 --> 18:27.845
That's Webby  anderduck,
my new partner!

18:27.912 --> 18:31.815
Yeah! But it's actually
Vanderqua-a-ack!

18:31.895 --> 18:34.181
Whoa! Ooh!

18:34.302 --> 18:36.647
- Oh!
- Webby!

18:37.340 --> 18:41.717
I love it! I'm like a super-mega
rubber ball of death!

18:42.037 --> 18:44.311
You get Heron.
I'll get your granny.

18:44.388 --> 18:46.091
The juice!

18:55.994 --> 18:58.025
Ha!

19:23.139 --> 19:24.413
Protocol 78.

19:24.480 --> 19:26.632
Get your opponent to
underestimate your partner.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.622
Clever. How did you know
she could pull it off?

19:28.689 --> 19:31.203
Your granddaughter
is full of surprises.

19:33.761 --> 19:35.948
Get away! Get away!

19:38.197 --> 19:40.984
Gimme that juice,
you bad baddie!

19:49.451 --> 19:52.765
No! No!
It's wearing off! No!

19:57.712 --> 20:00.257
This is all your fault!

20:03.195 --> 20:04.845
Flip-six-three-hole.

20:05.203 --> 20:06.461
Hyah!

20:11.371 --> 20:14.341
- Hey-hey, it worked!
- Team up!

20:31.502 --> 20:33.701
Launchpad, take us home.

20:33.768 --> 20:35.978
Roger that.
Going in blind.

20:36.045 --> 20:38.847
Oh, that was so amazing!

20:38.914 --> 20:41.581
Agent 22 and McDuck
back in action!

20:41.648 --> 20:43.472
But-But hey,
what <i> did</i> happen

20:43.539 --> 20:46.050
in that first battle
with Black Heron?

20:47.327 --> 20:49.573
Just do something!

20:51.994 --> 20:53.441
Dash it all.

21:01.100 --> 21:03.425
This is disconcerting!

21:05.080 --> 21:07.449
What is happening?

21:11.277 --> 21:13.856
You will pay for that.

21:20.683 --> 21:24.434
22, you just
broke protocol for me.

21:24.501 --> 21:27.348
For the mission.
And you, partner.

21:28.058 --> 21:29.692
Whoop! Time to go.

21:30.487 --> 21:32.987
No-o-o-o!

21:37.467 --> 21:39.518
I have a feeling
I'm going to be cleaning up

21:39.585 --> 21:42.869
a lot of your messes
from here on out, Agent McDuck.

21:42.936 --> 21:45.418
- Call me Scrooge.
- Bentina Beakley.

21:45.495 --> 21:48.699
Whoa! I can't believe
I'm now part

21:48.766 --> 21:51.428
of an actual
McDuck-Agent 22 adventure!

21:51.495 --> 21:52.893
Thank you, Mr. McDuck!

21:52.960 --> 21:55.200
Call me Uncle Scrooge.

21:55.401 --> 21:56.823
I'm Webby!
