10:04.778 --> 10:05.930

10:37.637 --> 10:39.137
The hut with the blue door.

13:59.926 --> 14:00.970
Good shot.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.167
Wow.

14:12.199 --> 14:13.200
Thank you.

14:37.659 --> 14:38.965

14:49.889 --> 14:52.935
He grow up one day and fight.

14:57.374 --> 14:58.375
Where's your father?

15:01.291 --> 15:02.292

15:03.903 --> 15:04.968
You like my chicken?

15:04.991 --> 15:05.992
It's nice.

15:06.862 --> 15:07.994
When did he die?

15:10.997 --> 15:12.215
When I was little.

15:13.825 --> 15:15.958
This one, my second favorite.

15:16.785 --> 15:19.286
I like him just as much.

15:19.309 --> 15:22.443
But I need
to have a favorite though.

15:23.226 --> 15:24.575
You see the strips, huh?

15:25.750 --> 15:26.751
They're nice.

15:42.202 --> 15:43.290

17:33.008 --> 17:34.314
You just so quiet.

17:39.188 --> 17:40.233
That's enough.

17:49.024 --> 17:50.460
I did a good job, huh?

17:51.157 --> 17:52.245
So what next?

17:55.117 --> 17:56.118
We provide.

18:02.298 --> 18:03.299
Okay.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.088
Doni!

18:16.660 --> 18:18.358
Yeah.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.252
You need fish?

18:22.275 --> 18:23.470
I'm your man.

18:23.493 --> 18:24.668
I take care of it.

18:29.543 --> 18:30.674
So are you come...

18:31.458 --> 18:32.653

18:32.676 --> 18:34.090
I mean,

18:34.113 --> 18:36.115
do you want to come to dinner?

18:38.029 --> 18:39.118
Sure.

18:42.643 --> 18:44.471
Could you tell Doni
that I'll be back.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.125
Okay.

18:57.788 --> 18:58.920
How'd you go?

19:01.531 --> 19:04.076
Perfect. I do really good job.

19:04.099 --> 19:05.187
Best ever.

19:13.282 --> 19:14.652
Not good enough.

19:14.675 --> 19:16.132
What?

19:16.155 --> 19:17.872
Look there. See?

19:17.895 --> 19:18.896
There's a crack.

19:21.638 --> 19:23.791
It's no crack.

19:25.729 --> 19:27.230
Redo them.
Ha?

19:27.253 --> 19:28.970
Make me an extra set for spares.

19:28.993 --> 19:30.865
Oh. Okay.

19:31.996 --> 19:32.997
Five days.

21:18.842 --> 21:20.952
Good Mr. Ryan, get in.

21:38.601 --> 21:40.624
Go there. There, there, there.

22:26.432 --> 22:27.932
He die.

22:27.955 --> 22:29.260
My favorite one.

22:29.783 --> 22:30.827
How?

22:32.089 --> 22:33.308
A dog.

22:35.266 --> 22:36.355
Do you know which dog?

22:37.965 --> 22:39.183
Yes.

22:40.968 --> 22:42.186
So, what are you gonna do?

22:43.927 --> 22:45.015
What do you mean?

22:47.017 --> 22:49.345
You can't accept the dog
killed your chicken

22:49.368 --> 22:50.456
and let him go.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.349
Or you could kill the dog

22:53.372 --> 22:54.677
so it doesn't come back
and do it again.

22:55.504 --> 22:56.853
I don't kill dog.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.093
Why?

22:59.116 --> 23:01.052
Because that bad.

23:01.075 --> 23:03.359
I want a better cage.

23:03.382 --> 23:04.600
That will stop dog.

23:14.567 --> 23:15.655
Let's say a prayer.

23:17.265 --> 23:18.548
And bury the chicken.

23:18.571 --> 23:21.704
What about the others.
They not safe.

23:23.793 --> 23:26.599
We could sleep out here tonight.
And keep an eye on them.

23:26.622 --> 23:28.015
We'll fix the cage tomorrow.

23:48.818 --> 23:49.906
Hey.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.319
That's it.

25:18.342 --> 25:19.799
No more room.

25:19.822 --> 25:22.236
Why don't you take this
to the house. I get the rest.

25:22.259 --> 25:24.587
What about stuff
for my chicken house?

25:24.610 --> 25:25.698
We'll get that next.

25:28.744 --> 25:30.157
You okay with that?

25:30.180 --> 25:31.637
Yeah.

25:31.660 --> 25:33.967
Just need to get it started.

25:59.209 --> 26:00.405
Doni?

28:25.051 --> 28:26.139
Jenti?

28:27.749 --> 28:28.707
Doni?

28:30.621 --> 28:32.165
Doni!

28:32.188 --> 28:34.124
I'll fix him. Let me fix him.
What happened to my son?

28:34.147 --> 28:36.082
Clear the table.

28:36.105 --> 28:37.997
Do you have any antiseptic
or thread? Needles?

28:38.020 --> 28:39.782
No, no. I don't have.
Okay.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.131
I need you to put pressure here.

28:42.242 --> 28:43.939
No, Doni.

28:45.201 --> 28:46.289
Where are you going?

28:49.336 --> 28:50.749
I'll fix him.

28:50.772 --> 28:52.426
My son.

28:53.122 --> 28:54.797
Doni, my son.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.105
Are you a doctor?

30:05.499 --> 30:06.674
How you know all this?

30:11.200 --> 30:12.636
Tell me about the pirates.

30:22.864 --> 30:24.126
Every month they come.

30:27.129 --> 30:28.304
They took girls.

30:29.740 --> 30:30.872
They took money.

30:33.396 --> 30:34.571
They took lots.

30:36.269 --> 30:37.357
How many are they?

30:40.447 --> 30:41.555
Many.

30:41.578 --> 30:42.710
How many?

30:43.493 --> 30:44.755
Thirty, maybe.

30:47.889 --> 30:49.848
The people here give them
what they want.

30:55.375 --> 30:56.767
If not, they kill.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.208
Was it them?

31:19.268 --> 31:20.879
When he wakes,
I'm gonna take you somewhere.

31:21.749 --> 31:23.467
To another place.

31:23.490 --> 31:24.555
A better place.

31:24.578 --> 31:26.426
No, no. We stay.

31:26.449 --> 31:27.624
It's too late.

31:32.542 --> 31:33.761
What did you do?

32:09.928 --> 32:11.016
Mr. Lee,

32:11.886 --> 32:13.560
we're running late.

32:13.583 --> 32:17.129
We need more workers
and they want more money.

32:17.152 --> 32:19.894
You know the one thing
that I hate most in this world?

32:23.115 --> 32:24.528
Waiting.

32:24.551 --> 32:25.833
I understand, sir.

32:25.856 --> 32:27.661
But they need more time...
It's unfortunate

32:27.684 --> 32:29.011
that what they want
and what they get

32:29.034 --> 32:30.078
is two different things.

32:31.601 --> 32:33.580
Cut all their wages in half.

32:33.603 --> 32:35.649
Cut in half, sir...
As I just said,

32:36.476 --> 32:38.803
everyone gets half.

32:38.826 --> 32:40.306
With all due respect...
Then,

32:41.133 --> 32:43.025
next week,

32:43.048 --> 32:45.549
and they all have quit,

32:45.572 --> 32:47.748
they will come begging for work.

32:48.923 --> 32:50.249
We'll give them a raise.

32:50.272 --> 32:52.579
I say, what, 25 percent?

32:54.885 --> 32:56.081
You...

32:56.104 --> 32:57.996
need to give yourself
an opportunity

32:58.019 --> 32:59.867
to be a nice guy for once.

33:03.590 --> 33:04.872
Hello.

33:04.895 --> 33:06.352
Who is this?

33:06.375 --> 33:07.745
Not now, he's busy right now.

33:07.768 --> 33:11.467
Feel the amazing feeling
of giving someone a raise.

33:16.559 --> 33:18.561
Boss, I think
you might want to see this.

34:47.824 --> 34:49.217
Alive.

34:50.914 --> 34:54.527
I want you to bring him back
to me alive.

35:32.826 --> 35:34.044
Pretty necklace...

35:35.089 --> 35:36.351
for a pretty girl.

35:42.531 --> 35:44.031
I need to get something
from my boat.

35:44.054 --> 35:46.556
What? No. If something happen
I don't know what...

35:46.579 --> 35:47.580
I have to.

35:51.845 --> 35:53.476
I need you to keep
the kids inside.

35:53.499 --> 35:54.912
Pack some clothes.

35:54.935 --> 35:57.088
If I'm not back in two hours,

35:57.111 --> 35:58.655
take the kids
to the green church

35:58.678 --> 35:59.766
in the jetty.

36:02.334 --> 36:03.683
Please do as I say.

36:04.814 --> 36:06.294
Two hours.
Okay.

38:26.826 --> 38:27.914
Who sent you?

38:31.396 --> 38:33.200
How many others are there?

38:41.144 --> 38:42.494
How much they pay you?

38:43.451 --> 38:44.452
One million?

38:45.975 --> 38:47.107
Two?

38:55.333 --> 38:56.508
Two million?

38:58.510 --> 38:59.685
Was it Lee?

39:05.647 --> 39:06.822
They didn't pay you enough.

39:40.726 --> 39:41.770
No.

39:42.858 --> 39:44.620
I'm sick of waiting, Lee.

39:44.643 --> 39:45.861
I sent my men in.

39:48.037 --> 39:50.147
Do you think this is a game?

39:50.170 --> 39:51.975
Do you have any idea
who this is?

39:51.998 --> 39:55.065
I lost girls and I lost my men.

39:55.088 --> 39:58.024
I'm sick of this little game.

39:58.047 --> 40:02.202
You will not waste my chance.

40:02.225 --> 40:05.292
I need you to be a smart man now
and seep these next word

40:05.315 --> 40:08.818
to your fucking tiny,
little skull,

40:08.841 --> 40:11.995
you fucking wait 'til I say!

40:24.857 --> 40:26.554
Is everything alright?

40:31.820 --> 40:32.995
I found something.

40:36.521 --> 40:37.652
Something...

40:39.480 --> 40:42.309
I've wanted
for a very long time.

40:47.009 --> 40:49.011
How long you look?

40:49.882 --> 40:50.883
Many...

40:52.275 --> 40:54.713
...many years.

40:56.889 --> 40:58.543
What is this thing?

41:08.291 --> 41:09.336
A man.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.406
A murderer.

41:15.429 --> 41:17.300
And why you want him so bad?

41:20.129 --> 41:21.566
He killed my parents.

41:32.838 --> 41:34.100
How did he do it?

41:35.318 --> 41:36.494
This had to happen.

41:38.234 --> 41:39.409
I've killed too many.

41:41.977 --> 41:43.979
Their bodies were on the floor.

41:47.983 --> 41:49.637
Blood everywhere.

41:55.469 --> 41:57.863
They call him the "Message Man."

42:01.997 --> 42:03.869
I thought he was going
to kill me too.

42:10.136 --> 42:11.529
It's my time now.

42:14.836 --> 42:17.163
We'll see how he likes
losing things.

43:31.696 --> 43:32.784
Tom.

43:36.614 --> 43:37.615
Why?

43:39.355 --> 43:40.400
The money.

43:43.533 --> 43:45.425
I needed the money.

43:45.448 --> 43:46.841
It's been quiet out there.

43:48.930 --> 43:50.149
Kids are getting married.

43:50.932 --> 43:52.368
My goddamned mortgage.

43:53.195 --> 43:54.327
The kids.

43:57.286 --> 43:58.331
All grown up.

44:01.943 --> 44:03.728
Trish is married now
for god's sakes.

44:06.165 --> 44:07.166
Got a granddaughter.

44:08.863 --> 44:10.125
And Lucy?

44:15.000 --> 44:16.001
We're divorced.

44:17.698 --> 44:20.243
Hey, 20 good years out of it.

44:20.266 --> 44:22.311
All good things
come to an end, right?

44:27.969 --> 44:28.970
So...

44:32.626 --> 44:33.975
where does that
leave us, friend?

44:36.499 --> 44:37.762
Tell me about Lee.

44:47.554 --> 44:48.816
He got wind you were here.

44:50.426 --> 44:52.254
He's like a kid
with a fucking toy now.

44:53.038 --> 44:54.146
And how many?

44:54.169 --> 44:56.540
Jesus Christ,
it's fucking hot here.

44:56.563 --> 44:58.847
What are you doing
out here anyways?

44:58.870 --> 45:00.805
This fucking place
is a shithole.

45:00.828 --> 45:03.939
It stinks, mosquitoes,
bad water,

45:03.962 --> 45:05.767
thousand fucking islands.

45:05.790 --> 45:06.878
Wait, wait.

45:07.966 --> 45:08.967
Please.

45:33.078 --> 45:34.253
The other players.

45:36.951 --> 45:38.321
Uri?

45:38.344 --> 45:39.388
We just met.

45:45.220 --> 45:46.874
Third guy is a Jap.

45:48.615 --> 45:51.290
Chinese or some shit like that.

45:51.313 --> 45:52.770
He's been getting
all the big gigs

45:52.793 --> 45:54.055
over the last couple years.

45:55.709 --> 45:58.233
Listen, this guy doesn't play
by the same set of rules.

45:59.452 --> 46:00.670
And he's here now.

46:01.671 --> 46:02.672
Yeah.

46:03.848 --> 46:05.501
And the pirates,
the work for Lee?

46:07.939 --> 46:08.940
Yeah.

46:13.379 --> 46:14.380
Hey...

46:16.599 --> 46:17.775
I can walk away.

46:18.732 --> 46:19.733
Disappear.

46:21.474 --> 46:23.192
Completely off the grid.

46:23.215 --> 46:24.259
I tried that.

46:28.046 --> 46:29.830
What was it like
being alone for so long?

46:31.440 --> 46:32.485
Lonely.

46:36.837 --> 46:38.360
I'll keep an eye
on them for you.

46:41.973 --> 46:42.974
Thanks.

46:45.803 --> 46:47.152
Do they know about the family?

46:49.850 --> 46:50.851
Yeah.

46:52.418 --> 46:54.463
Something tells me
I'm just the distraction now.

46:57.118 --> 46:58.380
What's your
granddaughter's name?

47:07.737 --> 47:09.368
Suzie.

47:09.391 --> 47:10.500
She's the most beautiful thing...

47:31.805 --> 47:32.850
Send them now.

48:07.972 --> 48:08.929
Okay.

50:29.896 --> 50:31.289
Oh, shit!

51:54.720 --> 51:55.764
Jenti?

52:04.208 --> 52:05.165
Jenti.

52:13.347 --> 52:16.675
Why are they here, Mr. Ryan?

52:16.698 --> 52:19.527
Why they take my babies away?

52:23.444 --> 52:25.838
Why me?

52:49.688 --> 52:52.320
Ryan, welcome back.

52:52.343 --> 52:55.105
Did you like my gift?
I asked them to be creative

52:55.128 --> 52:58.108
and I hope
they did their job well.

52:58.131 --> 52:59.524
You know what I want.

53:00.873 --> 53:02.068
I will give you one chance,

53:02.091 --> 53:03.983
to bring them back to me
unharmed.

53:04.006 --> 53:07.488
See you in Jakarta.
Two hours or I kill them both.

53:33.253 --> 53:34.211
Just sleep.

53:37.953 --> 53:39.149
It's okay.

53:39.172 --> 53:40.608
I'm gonna get your kids.

53:42.480 --> 53:43.524
I'll get 'em back.

54:13.337 --> 54:14.381
Yes?

54:15.164 --> 54:16.752
Lee!

54:16.775 --> 54:18.472
Why the fuck is this here?

54:19.952 --> 54:22.627
To kill you, I suggest.

54:22.650 --> 54:25.369
You said that he will come
for you.

54:25.392 --> 54:27.589
Well I say he come
for all of us.

54:27.612 --> 54:29.135
No, no, fucking game.

54:30.789 --> 54:32.573
I will kill him myself.

54:33.922 --> 54:36.250
Then I will kill your girls,

54:36.273 --> 54:37.491
then I will kill you.

54:38.362 --> 54:39.775
You fucking with me?

54:41.103 --> 54:42.691
Good luck with that.

54:42.714 --> 54:44.867
Lee? Lee?

54:47.371 --> 54:48.523
Fuck!

56:52.844 --> 56:53.909
Due to time constraints,

56:53.932 --> 56:55.040
I won't be able
to stay very long.

56:56.282 --> 56:57.739
That being said,

56:57.762 --> 57:00.219
I feel under the circumstances,
I owe it to some people

57:00.242 --> 57:02.178
I've become very close to.

57:02.201 --> 57:04.049
To give you
my fullest attention.

57:09.121 --> 57:11.100
Please, don't kill me.

57:11.123 --> 57:13.494
This is not
an exercise in torture.

57:13.517 --> 57:14.735
Nor is it a lesson.

57:16.911 --> 57:18.499
This is a combination

57:18.522 --> 57:20.544
of all the bad choices
that you've made

57:20.567 --> 57:22.351
grouped into a single action.

57:23.527 --> 57:24.592
Me.

57:24.615 --> 57:25.767
Wait.

57:25.790 --> 57:27.182
We must...

57:28.445 --> 57:32.730
accept the consequences
of our actions.

57:32.753 --> 57:35.385
No matter how painful,
how torturous,

57:35.408 --> 57:38.606
how brutal or cruel
they may seem.

57:38.629 --> 57:41.936
Anything.
Women, money, anything.

57:44.504 --> 57:45.723
I don't need anything.

57:55.863 --> 58:00.410
Transfer code two four three
eight double-nine F-D-S.

58:00.433 --> 58:02.760
Voice recognition approved,
how can we help you today?

58:02.783 --> 58:05.328
I need a long-range consultant
and a satellite track for two.

58:05.351 --> 58:07.722
Please confirm
price and availability.

58:07.745 --> 58:09.941
We have a long-range consultant
available in the area.

58:09.964 --> 58:11.726
The price
will be one million, US.

58:11.749 --> 58:12.814
Do you approve?

58:12.837 --> 58:13.838
Approved.

59:18.729 --> 59:20.774
Activation code 1135.

59:22.907 --> 59:24.712
Your consultation
period is now active.

59:24.735 --> 59:27.932
Purchase request code 2315.
How may I be of assistance?

59:27.955 --> 59:29.847
Sending coordinates.
Relocate to marker one.

59:29.870 --> 59:31.545
Hold for instructions.

59:31.568 --> 59:33.329
Copy that.
Coordinates received.

59:33.352 --> 59:35.702
Relocating. ETA, 16 minutes.

59:47.671 --> 59:48.628
Where to mister?

59:54.678 --> 59:56.047
Where?

59:56.070 --> 59:57.483
Drive.

01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:21.313
How far away from here
do you live?

01:00:21.922 --> 01:00:23.074
Huh?

01:00:23.097 --> 01:00:24.751
How far away from here
do you live?

01:00:25.534 --> 01:00:26.535
Not far.

01:00:29.321 --> 01:00:31.628
Okay, turn down here. Here.

01:00:59.743 --> 01:01:00.938
No. No.

01:01:00.961 --> 01:01:02.287
I need you to listen to me.

01:01:02.310 --> 01:01:03.549
I'm gonna go into this building

01:01:03.572 --> 01:01:05.073
and I'm gonna get a small girl.
Okay.

01:01:05.096 --> 01:01:06.727
When I come back
we take her to your house.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.206
I want you to call your wife

01:01:08.229 --> 01:01:09.947
and tell her to be ready.
Not my wife. No, no.

01:01:09.970 --> 01:01:12.646
We go to one more location
and you are done.

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:14.560
No, no, no. Money is no good
if I die, mister.

01:01:14.583 --> 01:01:17.128
You will not die as long
as you stay in the vehicle.

01:01:17.151 --> 01:01:18.652
As long as
you do not leave this location.

01:01:18.675 --> 01:01:20.262
You understand?
No, no, mister.

01:01:20.285 --> 01:01:22.351
This is too dangerous for me.
You can go. Please, please.

01:01:22.374 --> 01:01:24.376
Please, you can go, mister.
What's your name?

01:01:25.159 --> 01:01:26.291
What's your name?

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:28.685
Adi.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.164
Adi.

01:01:31.644 --> 01:01:33.797
Adi, these people...

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:36.365
they take children
like your daughter.

01:01:36.388 --> 01:01:39.107
They abuse them
and then they sell them.

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:40.586
I'm gonna make sure
they never do it again

01:01:40.609 --> 01:01:42.110
but I need your help.

01:01:42.133 --> 01:01:43.851
Mm, no, no. I'm not involved.

01:01:43.874 --> 01:01:44.939
You already are.

01:01:46.572 --> 01:01:48.594
Look, you are not in danger
as long as you stay here, okay.

01:01:48.617 --> 01:01:50.184
Do not get out of the vehicle.

01:02:30.877 --> 01:02:32.270
Ha?

01:02:44.151 --> 01:02:45.152
Please advise movement.

01:02:49.983 --> 01:02:51.701
Relocate.

01:02:51.724 --> 01:02:54.031
Southwest.
Copy. Relocating.

01:04:02.316 --> 01:04:04.905
No clear shot.
Please advise.

01:04:04.928 --> 01:04:06.103
Hold for instructions.

01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:07.931
Copy.

01:04:21.335 --> 01:04:22.336
Hey!

01:04:24.338 --> 01:04:25.862
Oh, shit!

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.111
Bomb!

01:04:43.314 --> 01:04:44.379
What?

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:22.396
Ground vehicle clear.
Please advise next location.

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:31.295
About to enter top floor.
ETA one minute.

01:05:31.318 --> 01:05:33.233
Copy. Relocating.

01:06:22.935 --> 01:06:24.284
Ryan Teller.

01:06:26.156 --> 01:06:29.440
I have to admit,
I'm quite an admirer.

01:06:29.463 --> 01:06:31.051
Have clear shot.
Two targets.

01:06:31.074 --> 01:06:32.704
Your three o'clock
and your nine o'clock.

01:06:32.727 --> 01:06:33.836
Awaiting signal.

01:06:33.859 --> 01:06:35.339
The work you did in Korea.

01:06:37.558 --> 01:06:39.537
That group in Brazil.

01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:44.043
Beautiful.

01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:49.983
So it's hard to believe that

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:52.681
someone with such
a skill and passion

01:06:52.704 --> 01:06:54.358
for brutality would just...

01:06:57.056 --> 01:06:58.188
fade away.

01:07:07.588 --> 01:07:08.937
Seven years.

01:07:12.158 --> 01:07:14.007
You of all people
should understand

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:19.142
the necessity for such
drastic measures,

01:07:19.165 --> 01:07:23.755
if nothing but at least
find some kind of, uh...

01:07:23.778 --> 01:07:26.715
finality to our relationship.

01:07:26.738 --> 01:07:29.109
I'm actually
extremely grateful that

01:07:29.132 --> 01:07:31.067
now I have the opportunity
to show you

01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:33.875
how much you affected
my development as a child.

01:07:37.836 --> 01:07:40.969
Put them down or the girl
will die, very slowly.

01:07:46.975 --> 01:07:49.085
Put your guns down now.

01:07:52.242 --> 01:07:54.374
Put the guns down now!

01:08:00.424 --> 01:08:01.425
Kill the girl.

01:08:18.658 --> 01:08:20.313
Dewi? Hey.

01:08:21.444 --> 01:08:23.925
You okay? They didn't hurt you?

01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:25.926
Okay, come on.

01:08:29.234 --> 01:08:32.475
I need you to wait here for me.
Can you do that?

01:08:32.499 --> 01:08:34.719
I want you to cover your ears
and close your eyes again.

01:08:35.589 --> 01:08:36.590
Good girl.

01:08:56.957 --> 01:08:58.350
I shot him in the cerebellum.

01:08:59.743 --> 01:09:01.810
Paralyzed,
but all his sense and feelings

01:09:01.832 --> 01:09:04.051
are still intact
and responsive to pain.

01:09:08.796 --> 01:09:09.992
You know,
I've always considered myself

01:09:10.015 --> 01:09:12.081
a highly motivated person.

01:09:12.104 --> 01:09:14.604
Just imagine the, the passion

01:09:14.627 --> 01:09:16.108
I must be feeling.

01:09:19.024 --> 01:09:20.895
Can you imagine
the passion, Lee?

01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:23.613
Can you? Huh?

01:09:36.433 --> 01:09:38.130
Give me back the fucking boy!

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:46.269
If you've hurt him,

01:09:48.662 --> 01:09:50.814
I'll kill everyone
in your family.

01:09:50.837 --> 01:09:52.207
I'll kill all your friends,

01:09:52.231 --> 01:09:53.774
I'll kill
your business associates.

01:09:53.798 --> 01:09:56.017
I will kill everything
that you've ever loved.

01:10:00.979 --> 01:10:02.023
Kill him.

01:10:03.851 --> 01:10:06.767
Find and kill
this fucking piece of shit!

01:10:10.641 --> 01:10:11.685
We go to the club.

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:31.378

01:10:31.401 --> 01:10:33.467
Hey, mister. You're bleeding,
let me help you.

01:10:33.490 --> 01:10:35.164
No, I've got it.

01:10:41.193 --> 01:10:43.172
Keep her safe for me.

01:10:43.195 --> 01:10:44.718
Mother's address
is in her pocket.

01:10:59.124 --> 01:11:00.537
Mister, you bleeding.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:02.278
We need to fix you.
Let's go to doctor first.

01:11:02.301 --> 01:11:04.324
Need to hurry.
I haven't got much time.

01:11:04.347 --> 01:11:05.478
Get in.

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:12.593
They're moving.
Where to?

01:11:12.616 --> 01:11:14.334
The city.

01:11:14.357 --> 01:11:15.857
Go.

Your consultation
period has now ended.

01:11:31.983 --> 01:11:34.441

01:11:34.464 --> 01:11:36.921

01:11:43.386 --> 01:11:45.408
Adi, do you know this place?

01:11:45.431 --> 01:11:47.323
That's the Red Club.
Take me there.

01:11:47.346 --> 01:11:48.695
That's where they've got
the boy.

01:12:03.667 --> 01:12:04.798
Where we go, sir?

01:12:05.408 --> 01:12:06.365
Red Club.

01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:30.714
I'm gonna go get the boy.

01:12:30.737 --> 01:12:31.912
Okay, good luck.

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:34.936
You're gonna help me.

01:12:34.959 --> 01:12:37.396
No, no I cannot help you.

01:12:38.571 --> 01:12:40.420
No, I cannot.
Yes, Adi, you can.

01:12:40.443 --> 01:12:42.204
I believe that you can.
How can I help you?

01:12:42.227 --> 01:12:43.423
I'm just a Bajaj driver.

01:12:43.446 --> 01:12:44.685
No, you're a good man.

01:12:44.708 --> 01:12:47.165
You know the difference
between right and wrong.

01:12:47.188 --> 01:12:49.211
No, mister. Please, listen.

01:12:49.234 --> 01:12:51.213
These people are very, very bad.

01:12:51.236 --> 01:12:52.693
They're like the king of bad.

01:12:52.716 --> 01:12:54.718
If you don't help me,
this little boy could die.

01:12:57.634 --> 01:12:59.482
You have a choice,

01:12:59.505 --> 01:13:01.202
and I'm asking you
for your help.

01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:08.471
Okay.

01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:11.929
Okay, but this is the last time.

01:13:11.952 --> 01:13:14.279
This will be the last time
that I am going to help you.

01:13:14.302 --> 01:13:15.803
No more.

01:13:15.826 --> 01:13:16.978
Promise me,

01:13:17.001 --> 01:13:18.240

What do you want me to do?

01:13:30.362 --> 01:13:31.711
I need you to be rich.

01:13:32.277 --> 01:13:33.278
Huh?

01:14:37.081 --> 01:14:38.082
Hm?

Two armed guys
approaching your seven.

01:18:15.386 --> 01:18:16.648
No clear shot.

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:10.310
We are going to have
a lot of fun with you.

01:20:50.541 --> 01:20:53.457
It took a lot of work.
But here we are.

01:21:11.779 --> 01:21:13.129
Wait, wait.

Remember this sword, Ryan?

01:21:31.408 --> 01:21:32.975
You should.

It still have
my parents' blood on it.

Here's what I'm gonna do.

01:21:46.162 --> 01:21:47.662
Starting with the boy.

01:21:47.685 --> 01:21:49.011
I'm gonna keep him.

01:21:49.034 --> 01:21:51.405
Oh, and that little sister,
that little girl.

01:21:51.428 --> 01:21:54.147
I'm going to make her work
her whole fucking life.

01:21:54.170 --> 01:21:56.062
Until she's dead.

01:21:56.085 --> 01:21:57.977
Oh, and the mother, the mother?

01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:02.700
Oh, I'm going to cut her throat
into five parts.

Slowly.

01:22:06.399 --> 01:22:07.444
Get the message?

01:22:10.055 --> 01:22:11.752
You should have forgotten
about me.

01:22:15.408 --> 01:22:16.496
Bye, Ryan.

01:22:19.543 --> 01:22:20.544
