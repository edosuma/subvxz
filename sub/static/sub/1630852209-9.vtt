00:00.266 --> 00:01.567
[seal barking]

00:01.569 --> 00:03.168
[Mary] Good boy, Clyde.

00:03.170 --> 00:05.070
Clyde can be very stubborn.

00:05.072 --> 00:05.804
Target!

00:05.806 --> 00:07.406
- Whoop.
- [woman laughs]

00:07.408 --> 00:10.376
<i>[Mary] You can't force a
500-pound animal to do anything.</i>

00:10.844 --> 00:13.112
Good boy.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.914
<i>[Caitlin] I'm just gonna miss
having that time with him.</i>

00:15.916 --> 00:17.716
I'm like a nervous mom.
[chuckles]

00:17.718 --> 00:20.085
[seal barking]

00:20.087 --> 00:22.354
<i>[Ralph] Vanessa's favorite
treats are definitely apple.</i>

00:23.156 --> 00:24.890
Hey, Vanessa,
I got something for you.

00:24.924 --> 00:26.191
[squeals]

00:26.193 --> 00:28.961
<i>It's always really stressful
when you have an animal,</i>

00:28.963 --> 00:31.897
<i>especially an older animal
going for a procedure.</i>

00:31.899 --> 00:34.333
<i>I'm hoping that
will be an easy solution.</i>

00:34.335 --> 00:36.468
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

00:37.570 --> 00:38.737
[woman] Good girl.

00:38.739 --> 00:41.206
<i>Currently we have three
sifakas here at the Bronx Zoo.</i>

00:41.208 --> 00:42.574
Good boy.

00:42.576 --> 00:44.043
<i>Gemina currently
doesn't have a mate.</i>

00:44.045 --> 00:46.545
So we are eagerly
awaiting a mate for her.

00:46.547 --> 00:47.880
What do you think, buddy?

00:47.882 --> 00:50.482
We're just hoping
they hit it off. [chuckles]

00:53.653 --> 00:56.555
<i>[Jim] If you ask a child to
draw a picture of a zoo,</i>

00:56.557 --> 00:59.992
<i>chances are they'll draw
an animal behind bars.</i>

00:59.994 --> 01:03.028
We've got to take
that image and change it.

01:03.030 --> 01:04.830
[zoo keeper]
<i>They really enjoy this.</i>

01:04.832 --> 01:07.199
<i>It strengthens the bond
that we have with these guys.</i>

01:08.068 --> 01:09.601
[Jim] Come on. I know,
you don't like doors.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.369
[woman] Go on, ladies.

01:11.771 --> 01:14.573
<i>[Jim] It's not enough to keep animals
and exhibits just for people to look at.</i>

01:14.575 --> 01:16.742
<i>There has to be
a higher purpose.</i>

01:16.744 --> 01:19.711
<i>And for us, it's conservation
of species in the wild.</i>

01:19.713 --> 01:21.313
[crew member]
You rolling?

01:21.315 --> 01:24.450
<i>[Jim] The general public would never
get the access you're going to get...</i>

01:24.452 --> 01:25.984
[woman] Good girl.

01:25.986 --> 01:29.888
<i>[Jim] which is to see what goes
on behind the scenes every day.</i>

01:29.890 --> 01:32.024
[zoo keeper] <i>That's how we do
it here in the boogie down Bronx.</i>

01:32.026 --> 01:33.292
[all laugh]

01:38.298 --> 01:41.266
[seals barking]

01:49.909 --> 01:51.910
[Mary shouting]

01:51.978 --> 01:53.879
Good boy.

01:53.881 --> 01:55.347
Mary, I'm going
to open the door.

01:55.349 --> 01:56.415
- [Mary] Okay.
- Oh!

01:57.917 --> 01:59.118
Over here. Okay.

01:59.352 --> 02:00.385
Oh.

02:01.754 --> 02:03.222
Good boy.

02:07.260 --> 02:08.227
I'm going to try to send him in.

02:08.229 --> 02:09.461
Clyde, here.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.798
Okay. Good.
Go target!

02:12.800 --> 02:13.966
Good.

02:13.968 --> 02:15.534
- Whoop.
- [chuckling]

02:15.536 --> 02:17.369
Okay.
You're good, you're good.

02:18.538 --> 02:20.572
I have a really great
relationship with Clyde.

02:20.574 --> 02:23.642
I've been working with
him since he first came here.

02:23.644 --> 02:24.943
Good, Clyde...

02:24.945 --> 02:28.914
Clyde is a big mush.
He's very sweet, gentle giant.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.916
He's very goofy.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.252
<i>He is like a big puppy dog.</i>

02:33.286 --> 02:35.220
Good boy.

02:35.222 --> 02:36.889
But he can be very stubborn.

02:36.891 --> 02:39.558
If he doesn't want to do
something, he will not.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.326
Want to try once more?
Target!

02:42.028 --> 02:43.328
[laughs]

02:44.597 --> 02:47.232
He's like, "I'm going to
target her instead."

02:47.234 --> 02:50.869
Clyde is our adult male sea lion
that we have here at the Bronx zoo.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.971
And he's a rescue
that we took in from the wild.

02:52.973 --> 02:56.942
Good boy.
Good boy. Good boy. Water.

02:56.944 --> 02:59.311
<i>[Jim] Clyde was
one of the male sea lions</i>

02:59.313 --> 03:02.581
<i>that were hanging around the
Bonneville Dam in Washington state.</i>

03:02.583 --> 03:04.316
<i>And they were snagging salmon</i>

03:04.318 --> 03:06.952
as the salmon were making
their run up the river to spawn.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.119
[exclaims]

03:08.121 --> 03:10.589
<i>People coming to the Bronx Zoo
will see these numbers</i>

03:10.591 --> 03:12.991
<i>that are freeze-branded
onto Clyde's back.</i>

03:12.993 --> 03:15.894
<i>That's so the wildlife
officials could identify him</i>

03:15.896 --> 03:18.363
<i>as an individual,
and see if that individual</i>

03:18.365 --> 03:20.866
<i>was keeping up with
this unwanted behavior.</i>

03:20.868 --> 03:22.100
[Mary] Good.

03:22.102 --> 03:23.835
<i>[Jim] It got
to the point with Clyde</i>

03:23.837 --> 03:26.338
<i>that really, the only option
left was euthanasia</i>

03:26.340 --> 03:28.574
<i>if a zoo like the Bronx Zoo
didn't take him,</i>

03:28.576 --> 03:30.042
so we gave him a home.

03:30.176 --> 03:32.978
[Mary] Can we go down?
On belly.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.913
<i>[Jim] We're moving Clyde
to the New York Aquarium,</i>

03:34.915 --> 03:38.283
and we'll take Tacoma, the male
who was bred there, and swap them

03:38.285 --> 03:40.552
so they'll be ready
for the breeding season.

03:41.154 --> 03:44.489
Come here.
Good boy. Target!

03:45.258 --> 03:47.593
Crate-training happens
in baby steps.

03:48.928 --> 03:51.930
<i>There's only so much we can do
to have Clyde want to crate.</i>

03:51.932 --> 03:55.100
<i>You can't force a 500-pound
animal to do anything.</i>

03:55.102 --> 03:57.135
Target. Target.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.105
Target. Target.

04:00.107 --> 04:02.307
Good.
That's okay, you're good.

04:02.942 --> 04:05.244
[Mary] You're good.
You're good.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.379
We have to make sure
that he's fully on board

04:07.381 --> 04:09.848
with the behavior,
every step of the way.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.617
[Mary] Target.

04:11.619 --> 04:14.353
<i>[Melissa] And that includes
building time in the crate.</i>

04:14.355 --> 04:18.423
<i>And we need to work on getting him to
let us open and close the door behind him.</i>

04:19.826 --> 04:22.394
[Mary] Nope. Go den.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.929
Oh he's going to the den.

04:23.931 --> 04:24.963
[Jim laughs]

04:24.965 --> 04:26.565
[Jim] It's like a game with him.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.934
[Mary] Good around. Target.

04:28.936 --> 04:31.036
<i>[Jim] Both Clyde and Tacoma
are important animals</i>

04:31.038 --> 04:33.538
because they came
as rescues from the wild.

04:34.807 --> 04:37.743
<i>Not only did we save them
as individuals,</i>

04:37.745 --> 04:42.014
but in doing so we made our
own population of sea lions

04:42.016 --> 04:44.383
<i>more healthy, because we're
bringing in new genes</i>

04:44.385 --> 04:46.151
<i>to make it more
genetically diverse.</i>

04:46.153 --> 04:48.720
Stick. Good.

04:48.722 --> 04:53.625
<i>[Jim] We are responsible for the care of
these individual animals and their wellbeing,</i>

04:53.627 --> 04:56.128
<i>but also for the sustainability</i>

04:56.130 --> 04:59.231
of healthy populations
of species into the future.

04:59.766 --> 05:01.133
Oops. Sorry, buddy

05:01.135 --> 05:03.969
<i>[Jim] Clyde was here for
several years, Tacoma was there.</i>

05:03.971 --> 05:06.571
<i>They've already bred with
the females they were with.</i>

05:06.573 --> 05:08.073
<i>So now it's important
to switch them,</i>

05:08.075 --> 05:10.075
<i>introduce them to new females</i>

05:10.077 --> 05:12.277
<i>that he hasn't been with
before and breed with them.</i>

05:12.279 --> 05:13.278
Okay.

05:13.280 --> 05:14.313
Water?

05:14.315 --> 05:15.414
Yeah, we're good.

05:16.282 --> 05:18.016
And all done.

05:19.285 --> 05:20.886
[barking]

05:20.888 --> 05:23.455
<i>[Jim] Even though we've all gotten used
to Clyde being here with the Bronx Zoo,</i>

05:23.457 --> 05:24.556
once Tacoma gets here,

05:24.558 --> 05:26.558
<i>he'll be the new
big man on campus.</i>

05:27.560 --> 05:31.096
[seal barking]

05:35.902 --> 05:37.803
Oh my God. Look, Juanita.
Right there.

05:37.805 --> 05:40.238
Oh my gosh,
look at his ears, too.

05:43.543 --> 05:45.744
<i>[Ralph] Vanessa's favorite
treats are definitely apple.</i>

05:45.746 --> 05:48.447
<i>She also likes carrots and yams.</i>

05:50.850 --> 05:53.085
Hey, Vanessa,
What are you doing?

05:53.087 --> 05:54.219
I got something for you.

05:54.221 --> 05:55.854
[squeals]

05:55.856 --> 05:57.422
We're going to shift her over.

06:00.259 --> 06:03.795
<i>We have a number of red-river
hogs here at the Bronx Zoo.</i>

06:03.797 --> 06:06.965
Vanessa,
she's about 17 years old.

06:06.967 --> 06:08.667
She's a really friendly animal,

06:08.669 --> 06:10.435
and she always
wants something to eat.

06:11.604 --> 06:14.406
I've been with
Vanessa about a year now.

06:14.408 --> 06:18.110
Top thing I found really special
about working with red river hogs is...

06:18.112 --> 06:22.948
how curious they are and how much
they really actually want your attention.

06:22.950 --> 06:25.016
She's very vocal.

06:25.018 --> 06:25.584
[squeals]

06:25.586 --> 06:27.886
And there she goes.

06:27.888 --> 06:31.656
<i>Vanessa's been struggling with
her right eye for a while.</i>

06:31.658 --> 06:33.792
It's red and irritated,

06:33.794 --> 06:36.294
and it seems to
actually really bother her.

06:37.764 --> 06:40.031
The plan is for us
to go in and dart her,

06:40.033 --> 06:41.900
then move
her to the health center.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.169
I'm going to go
get the dart ready.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.004
[Ralph] Right there.
Just set...

06:46.006 --> 06:47.439
See if we can get the angle.

06:50.009 --> 06:52.010
- Got her?
- Yeah

06:52.945 --> 06:55.981
[Dr. Chaney] We have initial
effects, but she's still standing.

06:57.216 --> 06:59.918
It's always really stressful
when you have an animal,

06:59.920 --> 07:02.821
especially an older
animal, going for a procedure.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.890
[Dr. Chaney] Head up higher
if you can.

07:04.892 --> 07:08.326
And let's straighten her. I feel
air passing through it. Okay, good.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.930
I'm hoping that
there'll be an easy solution.

07:11.932 --> 07:12.964
[zoo keeper] Head in first?

07:12.966 --> 07:14.166
[Dr. Chaney] Yes, please.

07:14.168 --> 07:16.034
So I will be worried about it.

07:32.985 --> 07:37.389
[Carolyn] Alrighty. So I've got
my target and my mixed nuts.

07:37.391 --> 07:39.558
So I'm all set to do a training
set with Kate and Martin.

07:48.668 --> 07:50.001
Come on, Kate.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.636
Here at the Bronx Zoo
in the Madagascar building,

07:51.638 --> 07:54.539
<i>we have five
different species of lemurs.</i>

07:54.541 --> 07:57.542
Out of all those species, though,
the sifaka is definitely my favorite.

08:01.948 --> 08:03.782
<i>They have such
a distinctive walk.</i>

08:03.784 --> 08:06.918
It's that bipedal
hop that you'll see.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.220
<i>They live
mostly up in the trees,</i>

08:08.222 --> 08:09.754
<i>so they need to
have powerful back legs</i>

08:09.756 --> 08:11.556
<i>to do those long jumps.</i>

08:11.558 --> 08:13.592
<i>For them
it looks almost effortless,</i>

08:13.594 --> 08:16.061
<i>when they just hop
from one side to the exhibit,</i>

08:16.063 --> 08:19.264
with only touching one tree in the
middle. It's extremely impressive.

08:21.567 --> 08:22.501
Kate.

08:23.803 --> 08:25.270
Good girl.

08:25.272 --> 08:29.040
<i>This training is really important
just for us to really get hands-on</i>

08:29.042 --> 08:31.042
<i>and being able to
get tactiles on them.</i>

08:31.978 --> 08:32.477
Touch.

08:32.479 --> 08:33.945
Good girl.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.581
<i>And also just, you know, for
them to stay comfortable with us</i>

08:36.583 --> 08:38.884
<i>and for us to build
a relationship with them.</i>

08:38.951 --> 08:40.719
Good boy.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.188
Currently we have three
sifakas here at the Bronx Zoo.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.657
<i>We have our older female, Kate.</i>

08:45.659 --> 08:47.859
<i>We also have
her companion Martin.</i>

08:47.861 --> 08:50.862
And then we also have our
young female named Gemina.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.697
<i>Gemina currently
doesn't have a mate</i>

08:52.699 --> 08:54.866
<i>because she was previously
housed with her mother,</i>

08:54.868 --> 08:57.269
<i>who was relocated
to a different facility.</i>

08:57.271 --> 09:00.038
So we are eagerly
awaiting a mate for her.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.439
Target.

09:02.441 --> 09:04.376
Good.
Can you come here?

09:05.645 --> 09:07.245
Good girl.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.814
They're just working
on their treat right now.

09:09.816 --> 09:11.149
It might take them a bit.

09:11.151 --> 09:13.752
Coquerel's sifaka
is a type of lemur,

09:13.754 --> 09:17.222
and all lemurs are endemic
to the island of Madagascar.

09:17.224 --> 09:21.126
<i>Out of over 100 lemur
species that are in Madagascar,</i>

09:21.128 --> 09:23.428
at least a third are
critically endangered.

09:23.430 --> 09:25.530
<i>And this is a result
of habitat destruction,</i>

09:25.532 --> 09:30.035
<i>which is in part due to the
harvesting of ebony and rosewood.</i>

09:30.037 --> 09:33.438
<i>It's just nice to set up another
breeding pair for sifakas,</i>

09:33.440 --> 09:36.007
in order to
sustain the population.

09:41.948 --> 09:44.115
- Hi.
- You guys made it.

09:46.953 --> 09:48.720
[Hulya]
<i>It's around 7:00 p.m.</i>

09:48.722 --> 09:51.189
and we just arrived
back from the Cincinnati Zoo.

09:51.191 --> 09:54.759
Okay, we'll stop staring
at you and just let you out.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.996
<i>We have our male sifaka,
Andri, with us.</i>

09:57.998 --> 10:01.333
<i>He's here to be
a companion animal to Gemina.</i>

10:05.037 --> 10:07.205
I know it is really quiet.

10:08.074 --> 10:09.240
Ready?

10:10.710 --> 10:12.444
What do you think?
Come on out.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.483
It's exciting to get
to know new animals

10:18.485 --> 10:20.819
and make them comfortable.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.320
[Colleen] What do you think,
buddy?

10:22.322 --> 10:24.022
- There you go.
- [Hulya] Hey...

10:24.957 --> 10:26.191
Aw.

10:28.094 --> 10:29.961
Hey, there.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.464
[Colleen] There you go.
It's all new and different.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.232
[Hulya]
Since he just got here...

10:34.234 --> 10:36.901
- [Colleen] Nice.
- [Hulya] we will observe him for the next few days,

10:36.903 --> 10:39.270
and make sure he adjusts well
before we introduce him Gemina.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.072
I'm excited for
them to meet each other.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.540
I think they'll
make a good pair.

10:44.744 --> 10:46.044
It looks like he's settling in.

10:46.046 --> 10:50.081
His tail is straight. When
they're nervous or anxious,

10:50.083 --> 10:52.784
their tail, they curl up their
tails and kind of hug them.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.753
The fact
that his tail is straight

10:54.755 --> 10:55.887
says that's
he's in a good place.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.089
- [Colleen] Just checking it all out.
- [Hulya] Yeah.

10:58.091 --> 11:01.092
He looks good. I think
we'll leave the lights like this.

11:05.798 --> 11:07.132
Wonderful. Excellent.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.802
[man]
Welcome home, Amos.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.271
Want to go for a walk?
[chuckles]

11:13.273 --> 11:17.475
So awesome seeing a pelican roam
the hallways and enjoying himself.

11:19.912 --> 11:20.879
Hello, guys.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.348
We don't do
introductions very often.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.316
We're just hoping
they hit it off. [chuckles]

11:25.318 --> 11:27.218
Good boy.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.387
Look how handsome Gem is.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.196
[Jim]
<i>Wildlife Conservation Society</i>

11:38.198 --> 11:40.832
<i>has five parks
in the city of New York.</i>

11:40.834 --> 11:42.867
There's the Bronx Zoo,
Central Park, Queens,

11:42.869 --> 11:45.036
Prospect Park and The Aquarium.

11:47.006 --> 11:48.206
- Look at that one.
- Do you see that...

11:48.208 --> 11:49.307
[woman] So cute.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.975
<i>[Jim] Because
we have these five parks,</i>

11:50.977 --> 11:53.778
<i>we can breed, exchange animals</i>

11:53.780 --> 11:56.281
<i>and create a situation
among our five parks,</i>

11:56.283 --> 11:58.083
where we have
a healthy genetic population

11:58.085 --> 12:00.351
with a lot of diversity.

12:01.954 --> 12:04.222
Oh, there goes a little
guy popping up right there.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.258
Where did he go, Connor?
[laughs] Oh, there he is.

12:07.260 --> 12:11.062
<i>[Jim] The situation with sea
lions is a perfect example.</i>

12:11.064 --> 12:12.964
Right now,
the staff is in preparation

12:12.966 --> 12:16.501
for moving Clyde to the
aquarium in the coming month.

12:16.503 --> 12:19.804
<i>We'll take Tacoma, the male that
has bred there, and swap them,</i>

12:19.806 --> 12:23.174
<i>so they'll be exposed to new
females that they haven't bred with.</i>

12:23.176 --> 12:27.879
And this is all an effort to
keep our population healthy

12:27.881 --> 12:28.546
and genetically variable.

12:34.153 --> 12:35.286
[seal barks]

12:36.288 --> 12:37.555
[Caitlin] Good, Tacoma.

12:37.757 --> 12:38.490
Okay...

12:39.058 --> 12:42.560
Good. Good. High five. Good.

12:42.562 --> 12:45.597
<i>Tacoma is our male
California sea lion.</i>

12:45.599 --> 12:48.233
<i>And he's a pretty special guy.
He is a rescue animal.</i>

12:48.235 --> 12:52.203
I call him Teddy or Teddy
Bear, Tacoma or T. [chuckles]

12:52.838 --> 12:53.938
So handsome.

12:55.241 --> 12:57.075
Good, T, come!

12:57.077 --> 12:58.710
He's very laid back.

12:58.712 --> 13:00.011
Sleep.

13:00.013 --> 13:02.080
For being an animal rescue
from the wild,

13:02.082 --> 13:04.849
he's just...
seems pretty chill,

13:04.851 --> 13:07.952
and is just kind of like
a cool guy to hang out with.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.053
Good boy.

13:09.922 --> 13:10.989
Water.

13:11.824 --> 13:13.091
Good.

13:14.126 --> 13:18.129
Right now, our main focus
is getting him crate-trained

13:18.131 --> 13:20.265
and ready to
transfer to the Bronx Zoo.

13:21.233 --> 13:22.801
Okay, here we go.

13:22.803 --> 13:24.836
Duck. Good. Come.

13:24.838 --> 13:27.572
<i>He will be
interacting with new females,</i>

13:27.773 --> 13:29.941
<i>and hopefully
getting some new girlfriends.</i>

13:31.010 --> 13:32.610
Good, Tacoma. Good boy.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.412
<i>During today's session,</i>

13:34.414 --> 13:38.082
<i>a good outcome would be for
him to go all the way into the crate...</i>

13:38.417 --> 13:39.317
Inside.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.020
And receive his reinforcement.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.290
Good, Bear. You got it.

13:46.892 --> 13:48.793
Good, Tacoma.

13:48.795 --> 13:51.129
<i>We've been crate-training
Tacoma for a few months now.</i>

13:51.131 --> 13:52.964
<i>It was a bit of
a challenge at first,</i>

13:52.966 --> 13:55.934
<i>because he was
coming out of breeding season.</i>

13:55.936 --> 13:59.771
Way to go, Teddy Bear,
you did it. Back up.

13:59.773 --> 14:03.374
<i>His focus was mostly on females.</i>

14:05.044 --> 14:08.413
<i>Since he came out of that,
it's been going really well.</i>

14:08.415 --> 14:09.480
Come.

14:10.082 --> 14:11.216
Tacoma.

14:14.787 --> 14:18.223
Tacoma, go target! Tacoma!

14:18.225 --> 14:21.125
Good, you did it!
You're all done. Let's go.

14:21.127 --> 14:23.061
Tacoma, good.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.162
Water.

14:25.164 --> 14:26.231
Good.

14:27.032 --> 14:28.900
He's very easygoing.

14:28.902 --> 14:32.103
[seal barks]

14:32.105 --> 14:36.107
I'll be sad to lose him,
just because he's my buddy.

14:36.642 --> 14:39.110
<i>But I am excited to meet Clyde</i>

14:39.112 --> 14:42.113
and hopefully build
a good relationship as well.

14:42.147 --> 14:44.249
[seal barks]

14:54.059 --> 14:56.027
- [man] Oh, wow.
- [people chattering indistinctly]

14:58.097 --> 14:59.530
[boy] Whoa!

15:02.167 --> 15:05.136
Hello. Hello, guys.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.940
Can you come down here?
Good boy.

15:09.475 --> 15:11.242
You want a nut?

15:11.244 --> 15:15.380
<i>Today we're going to introduce Andri,
our new male sifaka, to Gemina, our female.</i>

15:15.981 --> 15:17.916
Look how handsome Gem is.

15:17.918 --> 15:20.051
<i>They've been seeing each other</i>

15:20.053 --> 15:22.487
<i>and interacting with
each other from a distance.</i>

15:22.988 --> 15:23.821
Can we come back?

15:23.823 --> 15:25.690
- There you go.
- [laughs]

15:25.692 --> 15:29.160
<i>And today's the day
that we're going to give them</i>

15:29.162 --> 15:31.462
<i>access to each
other through a mesh door.</i>

15:32.264 --> 15:33.097
Want me to do the other side?

15:33.099 --> 15:34.532
Yes.

15:35.968 --> 15:38.970
<i>These guys live in family
groups, so they'll just be together</i>

15:38.972 --> 15:40.204
<i>once we introduce them.</i>

15:42.808 --> 15:44.075
There we go.

15:45.377 --> 15:46.744
Run, little man.

15:56.055 --> 15:59.057
<i>[Hulya] We're looking for a
lot of grooming, set marking.</i>

15:59.059 --> 16:01.192
<i>We want them to
be next to each other,</i>

16:01.194 --> 16:03.561
<i>but not being
aggressive at the mesh.</i>

16:03.563 --> 16:05.196
That's why
we put an intro door up.

16:05.198 --> 16:08.066
<i>So we have a little more
control over the introduction.</i>

16:12.071 --> 16:16.541
She's a little frustrated.
Yeah. [laughs]

16:16.543 --> 16:20.912
<i>The females usually
get a little more agitated.</i>

16:20.914 --> 16:24.215
<i>Whereas the male just, he
wants to be with the female.</i>

16:24.217 --> 16:27.018
<i>He'll pursue the female.
He'll chase the female,</i>

16:27.020 --> 16:30.054
but sometimes
the female are like, "Enough,"

16:30.056 --> 16:33.558
and they'll chase the males
back until they're ready...

16:34.560 --> 16:35.727
[chuckles]

16:35.729 --> 16:37.996
Until they're ready
to accept them.

16:38.864 --> 16:40.965
Which he will have to learn.
[laughs]

16:41.567 --> 16:42.567
Right, mister?

16:45.270 --> 16:47.238
<i>[Jessica] I would say
it's going well.</i>

16:48.240 --> 16:50.341
He is extremely
interested in her.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.111
Very cute.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.548
They're calming down
a little bit now.

16:58.317 --> 17:00.018
You think
we should slow down, bud?

17:00.020 --> 17:03.221
You did so well. Yeah.

17:04.123 --> 17:07.058
<i>[Hulya] We don't do
introductions very often.</i>

17:07.060 --> 17:09.027
<i>So as somebody who's
interested in behavior,</i>

17:09.029 --> 17:11.095
it's very interesting to watch.

17:11.097 --> 17:13.831
<i>Being able to see it
is exciting.</i>

17:13.833 --> 17:16.667
<i>We'll continue with the howdy
introductions every day,</i>

17:16.669 --> 17:18.936
<i>depending on
how they're interacting.</i>

17:18.938 --> 17:21.039
<i>And from there,
we'll remove the howdy door</i>

17:21.041 --> 17:24.142
<i>and they'll have
a physical introduction.</i>

17:24.144 --> 17:26.144
We're just hoping
they hit it off. [chuckles]

17:27.279 --> 17:28.479
Good boy.

17:29.181 --> 17:31.115
Come on, Clyde!

17:31.117 --> 17:33.951
<i>Today we're preparing
to crate Clyde</i>

17:33.953 --> 17:35.987
<i>to go to the New York aquarium.</i>

17:35.989 --> 17:37.188
[indistinct chatter]

17:38.757 --> 17:40.291
Aw.

17:41.994 --> 17:45.096
<i>He's been showing
a lot of interest in Gemina,</i>

17:45.098 --> 17:48.266
and I think they're
just anxious to be together.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.700
Here we go.

17:55.707 --> 17:58.709
[Brenda] <i>We're at the health
center for Vanessa, red river hogs,</i>

17:58.711 --> 18:01.079
because she's had
this ongoing eye issue.

18:04.483 --> 18:08.152
<i>Dr. Sapienza is a consultant
we use for eye issues,</i>

18:08.154 --> 18:12.356
<i>and he'll determine what
course of treatment we need to do.</i>

18:13.826 --> 18:17.428
[Dr. Sapienza]
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

18:24.803 --> 18:28.072
We've been observing Vanessa
for over six months now,

18:28.074 --> 18:31.275
and we know that progressively
the eye has been getting worse.

18:31.277 --> 18:34.178
Do you think that we can talk about
options, or do you think enucleation...

18:35.914 --> 18:37.081
Okay.

18:37.083 --> 18:38.883
<i>[Dr.Sapienza] Enucleation
is the removal of the eye.</i>

18:38.885 --> 18:42.820
<i>Eye removal to us is always
like the end all, fail all.</i>

18:42.822 --> 18:46.090
<i>So we try to avoid that
unless nothing else is working.</i>

18:46.092 --> 18:49.060
<i>But the layer of the cornea
was flaking off little by little,</i>

18:49.062 --> 18:51.062
and she ended up
getting a deep corneal ulcer.

18:51.064 --> 18:54.031
It was very painful
and it was difficult to treat.

18:54.033 --> 18:56.200
So the decision
was to remove the eye.

18:56.202 --> 18:58.736
Can we get one more,
like blanket-like materials?

18:58.738 --> 19:01.205
- Blanket? Towel?
- Towel. Perfect.

19:02.107 --> 19:04.942
We'll prep right here.
Okay. Everybody good?

19:04.944 --> 19:05.877
- Yep.
- Yep.

19:05.879 --> 19:07.178
- We're good.
- Perfect.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.016
[indistinct conversation]

19:21.160 --> 19:22.493
Okay, eyeball is out.

19:22.694 --> 19:25.429
That was quick.

19:25.431 --> 19:28.099
<i>[Dr. Sapienza] So there'll be a little
discomfort first couple days afterwards,</i>

19:28.101 --> 19:31.502
<i>but she'll basically bounce
back as well as before.</i>

19:31.537 --> 19:33.204
All right, we're all done.

19:36.141 --> 19:39.744
<i>[Dr. Chaney] Her other eye
will permit her to see fine,</i>

19:39.746 --> 19:42.113
<i>so that she can go about
living her life normally.</i>

19:42.147 --> 19:44.348
<i>Now that she's out of surgery,</i>

19:44.350 --> 19:46.484
we really want to make
sure that she's comfortable.

19:46.952 --> 19:48.986
One, two, three.

19:50.789 --> 19:52.089
[Dr. Chaney]
<i>We'll keep her at the barn,</i>

19:52.091 --> 19:54.425
making sure
that incision heals well.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.331
Okay,
she's breathing really well.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.202
I hope she's so much
more comfortable, Mike.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.671
I do see the muscles
moving in here, though.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.406
Yeah, that's good.

20:09.741 --> 20:12.009
<i>[Brenda] Vanessa's been
in the park for a long time.</i>

20:12.011 --> 20:15.146

[woman] Nessy. Nessa pig.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.218
She's one of

20:20.852 --> 20:22.386
<i>Everybody
wants her to feel well,</i>

20:22.388 --> 20:24.922

chance of, you know,

20:24.924 --> 20:27.158
pulling through
this without any issues.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.093
I feel comfortable
with what I'm seeing.

20:29.861 --> 20:31.195
Nessa pig.

20:32.097 --> 20:33.064
Got to wake up.

a month and a half now.

<i>There is a
lot of pressure on me,</i>

<i>because I have to make sure
that he actually goes into the crate,</i>

What a good boy.

22:01.286 --> 22:03.054
[Mary] Oh, there it goes.

22:09.128 --> 22:10.861
<i>This has been
months of hard work.</i>

22:10.863 --> 22:13.864
They've been working together
through behavioral progression.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.166
<i>It's excellent.</i>

22:17.803 --> 22:19.670
<i>[Mary] I'm gonna
miss Clyde a lot.</i>

22:19.672 --> 22:23.140
You can't help but not get attached
to an animal that you work with.

22:23.142 --> 22:25.376
<i>I know he's not
going to be that far away,</i>

22:25.378 --> 22:28.145
<i>but it's not the same
as seeing him every day.</i>

22:28.147 --> 22:30.114
[woman] Need to see him again.

22:31.583 --> 22:33.184
[woman speaking]

22:33.186 --> 22:35.953
- [woman] He's waving.
- [Mary] They're like, What's going on?

22:39.191 --> 22:40.458
[woman] "Bye, Dad."

22:41.159 --> 22:42.193
[Mary] "No."

22:42.195 --> 22:43.494
[woman laughs]

22:43.561 --> 22:46.130
<i>[Mary] It's time
for Clyde to move on.</i>

22:46.132 --> 22:49.834
<i>I'm excited for him to start
a new chapter of his life,</i>

22:49.836 --> 22:52.203
<i>and breed with other sea lions,</i>

22:52.205 --> 22:55.239
<i>and have little pups
of his own over there,</i>

22:55.974 --> 22:58.109
and be with a great staff.

23:06.151 --> 23:07.785
[people chattering]

23:07.787 --> 23:10.054
[Mary] See you
on the other side, Clyde.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.489
Packed up and ready to go.

23:14.826 --> 23:17.695
<i>As sad as it is for
Clyde to be leaving,</i>

23:17.697 --> 23:20.998
<i>it's really important to have him
move to the New York Aquarium,</i>

23:21.000 --> 23:24.235
as we will be receiving
the new male, Tacoma.

23:28.006 --> 23:29.306
[woman] Aw.

23:33.712 --> 23:35.279
[man]
There's one down here, too.

23:35.281 --> 23:37.114
[woman]
Jumping from tree to tree?

23:37.116 --> 23:38.215
[man] Wow.

23:38.217 --> 23:39.417
[woman laughs]

23:43.755 --> 23:45.055
Get some goodies.

23:45.057 --> 23:47.291
Good, good, good.
That's for you.

23:47.293 --> 23:49.960
Got some grass,
all right, let's go do this.

23:51.296 --> 23:53.164
Hey guys, hi.

23:55.901 --> 23:57.168
All right, hi.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.570
[woman laughs]

24:00.205 --> 24:01.272
Look at that.

24:01.373 --> 24:03.174
[woman laughs]

24:05.811 --> 24:07.278
How has he been doing?

24:07.280 --> 24:10.748
[Vanessa] Good, he's been
showing a lot of interest in Gemina.

24:10.750 --> 24:13.117
He's showing a lot of
interest in his keepers,

24:13.119 --> 24:17.154
and I think they're
just anxious to be together.

24:19.825 --> 24:23.794
The plan is once they're
together, they're together.

24:23.796 --> 24:27.164
She needs to assert herself
and get comfortable.

24:27.166 --> 24:30.401
They just have to get to know each
other and see what the boundaries are.

24:34.773 --> 24:36.707
First, we put up a howdy screen,

24:36.709 --> 24:39.777
where they can actually touch
one another and get closer.

24:39.779 --> 24:42.279
<i>Andri and Gemina were very
comfortable with that right away,</i>

24:42.281 --> 24:43.981
<i>so we knew we could move forward</i>

24:43.983 --> 24:46.083
<i>with the physical introduction.</i>

24:46.184 --> 24:47.318
[Vanessa] Ready?

24:47.320 --> 24:49.119
[Colleen] Let 'em open.

24:51.223 --> 24:52.356
[Vanessa] He's ready.

24:59.998 --> 25:00.998
[Colleen] All right.

25:02.934 --> 25:04.268
Here we go.

25:07.105 --> 25:09.373
Oh, that's sweet.

25:10.876 --> 25:13.444
Wow, lots of grooming.

25:14.145 --> 25:16.213
She's grooming
him back now, nice.

25:16.215 --> 25:18.249
That's definitely
what we wanna see.

25:19.718 --> 25:22.887
They're a little overzealous,
I would say.

25:22.889 --> 25:26.957
<i>You always can see a difference
with introducing a very young male</i>

25:26.959 --> 25:30.995
and a very young female, who are
inexperienced at being in a breeding pair,

25:30.997 --> 25:34.732
with those that have
been in that situation before.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.967
<i>There's a lot of behavior
that's genetically wired,</i>

25:36.969 --> 25:39.069
<i>but there's also
a lot of learned behavior.</i>

25:39.071 --> 25:42.239
<i>They're trying to act
out the adult behaviors,</i>

25:42.241 --> 25:44.141
but they don't always
know if they got it right.

25:44.143 --> 25:48.512
And you're watching it evolve as
they get comfortable with each other.

25:49.781 --> 25:54.118
They look like they're
wrestling, more than bonding,

25:54.120 --> 25:56.854
but eventually she'll cuff him

25:56.856 --> 25:59.223
and give him
a little slot to push back.

26:00.959 --> 26:02.726
Oh, there it is.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.528
All right,
so she just moved away.

26:04.596 --> 26:06.997
First time, and
he's going to follow.

26:08.833 --> 26:11.835
<i>We really just want
them to be a compatible pair.</i>

26:11.837 --> 26:17.007
So, the next step would be to
introduce him to the exhibit.

26:17.009 --> 26:20.010
<i>Gemina knows the exhibit,
of course.</i>

26:20.012 --> 26:22.179
<i>It's great when you have one
animal that already knows it</i>

26:22.181 --> 26:24.548
<i>and can teach the other animal.</i>

26:24.716 --> 26:27.418
There's going to be a little
bit of a... what you're seeing.

26:28.153 --> 26:29.119
[Vanessa]
Little bit of chasing.

26:29.121 --> 26:30.287
[Colleen] Little bit.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.957
[Vanessa] Our job here is done.

26:32.959 --> 26:35.392
[Colleen] We may be done, and
now we're just watching the show.

26:38.697 --> 26:42.032
[Caitlin] Tacoma,
you're all right, bud.

26:42.034 --> 26:45.102
<i>I'm anxious just for
everything to go well.</i>

26:46.004 --> 26:47.371
I'm like a nervous mom.

26:48.073 --> 26:49.440
[Tacoma barking]

26:56.948 --> 26:57.982
[woman] Thank you.

26:58.216 --> 26:59.583
Hi, handsome.

26:59.585 --> 27:02.186
[Kathleen] Hey buddy.
What's going on?

27:03.288 --> 27:04.555
You wanna go for a walk?

27:05.457 --> 27:06.590
Okay, bud, come on out.

27:08.226 --> 27:09.026
Yay.

27:09.028 --> 27:10.193
[Kathleen] Isn't that great?

27:11.863 --> 27:15.065
Amos is a white pelican
from the Texas State Aquarium.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.168
[man] Yeah.

27:18.170 --> 27:20.537
Remember that opening scene
<i>in Saturday Night Fever,</i>

27:20.539 --> 27:22.172
and they showed just his feet?

27:24.042 --> 27:26.844
<i>You know, the attitude
and you know, he owns it.</i>

27:26.846 --> 27:28.078
<i>That's Amos.</i>

27:28.080 --> 27:30.214
He's John Travolta, as a bird.

27:34.185 --> 27:35.252
How are you?

27:35.254 --> 27:37.054
He has a great personality.

27:37.088 --> 27:38.789
[women laughing]

27:38.791 --> 27:41.992
<i>[Kathleen] White pelicans have
a huge wingspan, about nine feet.</i>

27:43.328 --> 27:46.563
<i>They're found from Canada
through the United States,</i>

27:46.565 --> 27:47.998
<i>and down to Mexico.</i>

27:48.033 --> 27:49.667
<i>He's a very confident bird.</i>

27:49.669 --> 27:52.803
<i>- I mean, considering his start in life.
- [woman] Yeah.</i>

27:52.805 --> 27:56.874
He was a wild bird, and
unfortunately, someone shot him.

27:56.876 --> 27:58.942
Probably in flight,
and in both wings.

27:58.944 --> 28:03.747
So he went to the Texas State
Aquarium to their rehab facility.

28:03.749 --> 28:06.784
<i>They had him for a few years,
and they worked with him a lot.</i>

28:06.786 --> 28:08.919
<i>But, some animals
after being shot, you know,</i>

28:08.921 --> 28:11.722
<i>if it's their wing and
they're compromised,</i>

28:11.724 --> 28:13.924
<i>they're not going to
be able to be released.</i>

28:13.926 --> 28:15.526
So, we said
we would take them here.

28:16.861 --> 28:18.962
<i>Amos has been out of the
health center a little over a month,</i>

28:18.964 --> 28:21.198
<i>and he's now
done with quarantine.</i>

28:21.200 --> 28:23.934
<i>So, we're going to be able to move
him to the tractable animal building,</i>

28:23.936 --> 28:26.537
because he's going to be
an ambassador for our program.

28:26.539 --> 28:30.441
So you get to appreciate a native
animal, up close and personal.

28:31.076 --> 28:34.044
I'm excited for him
to see his new home.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.979
[man] Oh, you wanna just take
his head and just kind of take it...

28:35.981 --> 28:37.815
[Kathleen] You're like
the police. "Watch your head."

28:37.817 --> 28:39.216
- [man] "Watch your head."
- [women laughing]

28:39.918 --> 28:41.218
[man]
It's a short trip, I promise.

28:42.620 --> 28:44.121
[Kathleen]
Look how calm he is.

28:44.889 --> 28:47.458
[man] All right. Off we go.

28:53.164 --> 28:54.565
[Kathleen] He's a calm bird.

28:54.567 --> 28:56.066
[man] Yeah, he was calm.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.334
[Kathleen] Amos is here.

29:00.004 --> 29:01.038
[man]
First thing he's gonna do,

29:01.040 --> 29:03.006
I feel like
he's going to spread those.

29:03.008 --> 29:04.842
- [Kathleen] Yeah, me too.
- Those big wings on him.

29:04.844 --> 29:06.577
- [Kathleen] Good boy.
- [man] Yeah.

29:07.378 --> 29:08.979
[Kathleen] Good job, buddy.

29:08.981 --> 29:10.247
Look at this.

29:11.583 --> 29:12.950
Welcome home, Amos.

29:12.952 --> 29:15.753
[woman] Now he's starting to
develop that... is it considered a horn?

29:15.755 --> 29:18.222
-[Kathleen] Yeah, I think they're horns.
-[man] Is it seasonal?

29:18.224 --> 29:20.157
- [Kathleen] Yeah, it's seasonal.
- [man] Yeah.

29:21.993 --> 29:24.762
Good boy. Good job, buddy.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.330
[Kathleen laughs]

29:27.265 --> 29:28.999
[man] Are we gonna try
to go in the classroom or...

29:29.001 --> 29:30.200
[Kathleen] Why not?

29:31.369 --> 29:32.870
<i>So awesome seeing a pelican</i>

29:32.872 --> 29:36.106
roam the hallways
and enjoying himself.

29:36.108 --> 29:37.374
And that's what it's all about.

29:37.942 --> 29:40.010
Where are we at, buddy?

29:40.012 --> 29:42.012
It is the first time
you're in here, huh?

29:42.981 --> 29:44.748
<i>When you look at him,
you could see him think,</i>

29:44.750 --> 29:47.017
<i>you could see
him take everything in.</i>

29:47.019 --> 29:49.920
Oh, I can't wait for him
to meet people, this is great.

29:49.922 --> 29:51.054
[woman laughing]

29:51.856 --> 29:52.956
[Kathleen] Amos.

29:53.057 --> 29:54.992
After you.

29:54.994 --> 29:57.027
<i>He's gonna be
a great program animal.</i>

29:57.295 --> 29:58.395
[Kathleen laughs]

30:05.336 --> 30:07.004
[Caitlin] Tootsie, come.

30:09.207 --> 30:10.874
Good, Tacoma, inside.

30:10.876 --> 30:12.075
Tacoma, good.

30:15.380 --> 30:16.480
Good.

30:18.049 --> 30:19.183
Good boy, T.

30:19.617 --> 30:21.819
Good trying, bud.

30:21.821 --> 30:25.355
This morning, Tacoma is going
to be moving to the Bronx Zoo,

30:25.357 --> 30:29.092
so we are getting ready to
prepare him for that transport.

30:29.094 --> 30:30.160
[driver] Good.

30:30.962 --> 30:33.230
[Caitlin] Good, Tacoma,
good boy.

30:34.799 --> 30:36.266
Bye, bud, good luck.

30:37.035 --> 30:38.502
[man] Have fun at the Bronx.

30:41.573 --> 30:44.741
[Caitlin] I've been working with
Tacoma for a little over three years,

30:44.743 --> 30:49.279
so, it's gonna be a little bittersweet
just to get him ready to go,

30:49.281 --> 30:51.381
'cause I won't be
seeing him every day anymore.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.185
You're a good boy.

30:56.221 --> 30:58.222
Everyone's here for you, bud.

30:59.057 --> 31:00.057
- [woman] Hi.
- [Caitlin] Hi.

31:00.059 --> 31:02.926
- [woman] How'd he do?
- [Caitlin] He was great.

31:02.928 --> 31:06.930
He seems pretty good. He was
really calm throughout the whole ride.

31:06.932 --> 31:08.198
So, he is ready.

31:10.068 --> 31:11.268
[people chattering]

31:11.270 --> 31:13.403
[suspenseful music]

31:14.873 --> 31:17.307
You see Margareta
supervising over here?

31:20.745 --> 31:23.614
<i>[Caitlin] I'm anxious, just
for everything to go well,</i>

31:23.616 --> 31:25.582
because I want everything to be

31:25.584 --> 31:28.185
<i>as least stressful
as possible for him.</i>

31:28.187 --> 31:30.287
I'm like a nervous mom.
[chuckles]

31:38.129 --> 31:39.529
[men] One, two, three.

31:42.967 --> 31:46.136
[Caitlin] Good, Tacoma,
good boy, bear.

31:46.138 --> 31:48.005
You're all right, bud,
you're okay.

31:52.543 --> 31:54.378
Oh, you're so fun.

31:55.179 --> 31:56.413
[Tacoma barking]

31:57.048 --> 31:58.248
Right in.

31:58.816 --> 32:00.183
[women] Ah.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.320
[Caitlin] Here we go.

32:03.322 --> 32:04.922
- [sea lions barking]
- [woman] Whoo.

32:04.924 --> 32:07.257
[Colleen] So, all of them are
like, right around him right now,

32:07.259 --> 32:10.260
so they all just
want to go see this new boy.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.896
[Hulya] He's exhibiting a lot
of his naturalistic behaviors

32:12.898 --> 32:14.865
that he would be
exhibiting in the wild.

32:14.867 --> 32:17.701
Then he's vocalizing,
announcing his territory

32:17.703 --> 32:18.835
to all the other bull see lions

32:18.837 --> 32:20.504
that might,
or might not be around.

32:24.075 --> 32:27.244
[Caitlin] He's definitely
interested in them, for sure.

32:28.012 --> 32:29.546
[Tacoma barks]

32:32.583 --> 32:34.685
[Caitlin] I'm going to miss
everything about Tacoma.

32:34.687 --> 32:38.388
I'm just gonna miss having that
time with him and hanging out.

32:40.858 --> 32:44.328
I just want for
Tacoma to do really well here.

32:44.330 --> 32:45.362
Deck?

32:45.830 --> 32:47.397
Good boy.

32:48.933 --> 32:52.135
<i>[Caitlin] My job the next few
days, is to help get him settled in.</i>

32:52.137 --> 32:53.103
Target.

32:53.105 --> 32:54.938
<i>It'll be an adjustment,
not just for him,</i>

32:54.940 --> 32:58.208
<i>but for all of the animals
and the keepers as well,</i>

32:58.210 --> 33:02.379
so, I just think they'll just need
time to adjust to their new normal.

33:03.414 --> 33:04.481
Water.

33:05.083 --> 33:06.283
Good.

33:06.851 --> 33:09.086
[Tacoma barks]

33:11.189 --> 33:14.157
[Lisa] I personally enjoy
interacting with any pig,

33:14.159 --> 33:15.592
because they're super smart.

33:16.127 --> 33:18.261
She's like, "Come on!

33:18.263 --> 33:20.263
When I do that,
I get a treat."

33:22.033 --> 33:23.500
They know something's going on.

33:24.569 --> 33:26.136
[Colleen]
We hope he just follows her.

33:26.804 --> 33:28.338
Go on, Gemina.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.573
[woman] And
they're super excited.

33:44.889 --> 33:45.589
[Lisa] Nessy pig.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.125
Nessy pig.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.459
Hi, Nessy pig.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.862
I have Vanessa's morning diet

33:51.864 --> 33:55.465
and her delicious
bucket of peanut treats.

33:57.235 --> 34:00.270
Vanessa has been at the health
center for about two weeks now.

34:01.672 --> 34:05.275
I am just doing a visual
assessment of her eye,

34:05.277 --> 34:07.544
or of the space
where her eye was.

34:07.546 --> 34:11.681
Just the same way you would look
for any post-surgical complications

34:11.683 --> 34:15.085
that I might need to bring to
the veterinarian's attention.

34:15.987 --> 34:18.255
And her eye looks totally fine.

34:20.258 --> 34:22.959
And she's
really bright and alert,

34:22.961 --> 34:26.096
and interacting
with me normally.

34:27.098 --> 34:30.133
Oh, what a good girl.

34:30.135 --> 34:33.170
So, what she just did was
she presented her right side,

34:33.172 --> 34:36.907
which is what she had
been trained to do previously,

34:36.909 --> 34:41.978
to administer eye medication,
from the last time that she was here.

34:42.947 --> 34:45.849
I know. She's like, "Come on!

34:45.851 --> 34:47.717
When I do that,
I get a treat."

34:47.719 --> 34:49.553
You're the smartest pig.
Yes, you are.

34:51.923 --> 34:55.358
I personally enjoy
interacting with any pig,

34:55.360 --> 34:57.027
because they're super smart.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.696
They learn and remember.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.531
I've known
Vanessa her entire life.

35:02.900 --> 35:06.536
Vanessa came here when
she was less than a year old.

35:06.538 --> 35:11.074
So, I was here taking care of
her when she was in quarantine.

35:11.076 --> 35:13.343
She's very used to
the space and very used to us.

35:14.178 --> 35:15.445
You got to use your nose.

35:15.980 --> 35:17.447
That a girl.

35:18.583 --> 35:21.818
<i>I'm really happy to see
Vanessa acting like herself</i>

35:21.820 --> 35:25.188
post-surgery, and
it's just a great indication

35:25.190 --> 35:28.325
that she is a resilient animal.

35:28.826 --> 35:31.128
You go up. Oh, so good.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.564
Good girl, Vanessa.
Okay, I'll see you later.

35:42.874 --> 35:43.940
[woman] Look, look over there.

35:43.942 --> 35:46.343
[child] And he's sitting
like how we sit.

35:47.945 --> 35:52.048
This is Andri on the right,
and Gemina on the left.

35:52.050 --> 35:54.151
They know something's going
on, they're super excited.

35:55.119 --> 35:57.954
And they also think I have
nuts, which I do not have.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.359
I'm just taking out the sumac.

36:03.861 --> 36:06.863
Sumac is their main browse,

36:06.865 --> 36:08.465
it helps with their digestion.

36:10.768 --> 36:13.069
So we can put this around.

36:13.071 --> 36:17.641
Andri, our new sifaka, has
been here for about three months,

36:17.643 --> 36:21.811
and today is going to be
his first day in the exhibit.

36:21.813 --> 36:24.381
He'll be going out
with his new mate, Gemina.

36:24.383 --> 36:26.750
It's very exciting,
because you never know

36:26.752 --> 36:29.619
how they're
going to react in the exhibit.

36:29.621 --> 36:32.989
This should make
them feel more comfortable,

36:32.991 --> 36:35.492
because they'll have
something to occupy them.

36:39.764 --> 36:41.064
[Colleen]
He hasn't done this yet.

36:41.066 --> 36:42.265
[Vanessa] That's Gemina.

36:42.267 --> 36:44.134
[Colleen]
Gemina knows her way.

36:45.102 --> 36:47.304
- We hope he just follows her.
- Okay?

36:47.306 --> 36:48.438
[Colleen] We are ready, yeah.

36:49.173 --> 36:50.173
Incoming.

36:52.243 --> 36:53.510
Go on, Gemina.

36:53.744 --> 36:55.545
Show him the way, though.

36:55.547 --> 36:59.082
<i>[Colleen] When we introduce sifakas to
this exhibit, I'm always a little nervous,</i>

36:59.084 --> 37:01.718
<i>because even though
they're athletic animals,</i>

37:01.720 --> 37:05.889
they do need to understand
the lay of the land, so to speak.

37:05.891 --> 37:10.827
<i>The sifaka exhibit is quite
tall. I mean, it's 25 feet high,</i>

37:10.829 --> 37:13.129
<i>and there's a lot
of features in there</i>

37:13.131 --> 37:17.534
<i>that allow them to use their
natural locomotor abilities.</i>

37:27.912 --> 37:28.545
[Vanessa] Nice.

37:30.982 --> 37:31.982
Go on.

37:32.650 --> 37:33.617
Yes.

37:36.687 --> 37:38.355
[Colleen] Oh,
it looks so good out there.

37:39.190 --> 37:40.824
[Vanessa] He is staying
pretty close to her.

37:40.826 --> 37:42.058
[Colleen] Yeah.

37:44.962 --> 37:46.396
[Vanessa] Whoo.

37:46.398 --> 37:48.798
[Colleen] Their leaps
are amazing.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.568
[Vanessa] But he's definitely
like, "I didn't know I could do this,

37:51.570 --> 37:53.270
we didn't have
this much room before."

37:53.272 --> 37:55.071
[Colleen] I know, this is great.

37:55.573 --> 37:57.407
They're venturing down.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.976
[Vanessa] They're venturing
down, towards the sumac, hopefully.

38:00.011 --> 38:02.412
There you go.

38:02.414 --> 38:06.349
[Vanessa] Andri looks great right
now. He's exploring it like a champ.

38:08.953 --> 38:10.887
It's going great.

38:10.889 --> 38:13.857
<i>I'm excited that we were
able to bring Andri here,</i>

38:13.859 --> 38:16.526
<i>to breed with Gemina,
because it's really important</i>

38:16.528 --> 38:20.697
<i>for us to sustain the sifaka
population for our ACA zoos.</i>

38:20.699 --> 38:22.766
[Vanessa] But you're being
a good teacher there, Gemina.

38:22.768 --> 38:24.034
[Colleen] She's showing,
like, "This one moves."

38:24.036 --> 38:25.869
[Vanessa] Yeah. [women laugh]

38:25.871 --> 38:28.004
[Colleen] "This one
you got to be careful of."

38:28.006 --> 38:29.372
<i>But it's worked out really well.</i>

38:33.144 --> 38:34.210
[John] Is everybody ready?

38:34.212 --> 38:35.945
Yeah, I'm ready.

38:35.947 --> 38:36.980
Come here.

38:37.047 --> 38:38.281
Good!

38:38.283 --> 38:40.216
[John] Honestly,
he is the highlight of my day.

38:40.218 --> 38:41.484
[sea lion barking]

38:54.332 --> 38:55.198
[John] Is everybody ready?

38:55.200 --> 38:57.100
Yeah, I'm ready.

38:57.102 --> 38:58.468
[John] Let's see if
he comes on his own.

39:00.204 --> 39:01.738
Clyde.

39:01.740 --> 39:04.307
<i>About a week ago,
Clyde, our male sea lion,</i>

39:04.309 --> 39:07.010
moved from the Bronx Zoo to
here at the New York Aquarium.

39:07.012 --> 39:11.214
And over the past week, he's just been
getting acclimated to all of our females,

39:11.216 --> 39:13.550
and used to his surroundings
here at the aquarium.

39:13.552 --> 39:14.484
Come here.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.519
Good, Clyde.

39:16.521 --> 39:18.021
[woman] Closing.

39:19.156 --> 39:21.358
<i>[John] I get to spend
a ton of time with Clyde.</i>

39:22.393 --> 39:23.460
That's it.

39:23.462 --> 39:25.295
Good.

39:25.297 --> 39:29.065
<i>Honestly, he is the highlight of
my day. I love hanging out with him.</i>

39:29.067 --> 39:31.868
He is charismatic
and barks a lot.

39:31.870 --> 39:33.503
[Clyde barking]

39:35.940 --> 39:38.174
[woman] He has
made his way onto the exhibit.

39:41.178 --> 39:42.212
Hi!

39:42.214 --> 39:42.946
[John] Open.

39:42.948 --> 39:45.048
Good.

39:45.050 --> 39:47.951
So I'm really excited to build a
relationship with a brand new male.

39:48.018 --> 39:49.953
Up, good.

39:50.588 --> 39:53.790
But, anytime an animal leaves
and goes somewhere else

39:53.792 --> 39:57.026
to a different zoo or an aquarium,
it's kind of the end of an era.

39:57.028 --> 39:58.995
And when Tacoma left,
here at the New York Aquarium,

39:58.997 --> 40:01.965
it definitely was
the end of an era.

40:03.567 --> 40:07.570
But the Bronx Zoo keepers are going to
take the absolute best care of Tacoma.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.841
[Hulya] Tacoma, come.

40:11.843 --> 40:14.844
[Jim] Finally, swimming around
or just hanging out on the rock.

40:14.846 --> 40:15.545
[Hulya] Good boy.

40:15.547 --> 40:16.946
[Jim] So how's he doing?

40:16.948 --> 40:20.216
[Hulya] Oh, he's doing great.
He adjusted almost immediately.

40:20.218 --> 40:23.319
Once he figured out who's feeding
him, and when, he's doing quite well.

40:23.721 --> 40:27.056
Touch.
Good.

40:27.058 --> 40:29.859
These close bonds that the
keepers have with the animals

40:29.861 --> 40:31.261
makes everything easier.

40:31.263 --> 40:32.395
[Hulya] Smiles up.

40:32.397 --> 40:33.930
Good boy!

40:33.932 --> 40:37.867
<i>[Jim] The keepers knew these
animals as individuals so intimately,</i>

40:37.869 --> 40:39.803
<i>they could
really tailor the move,</i>

40:39.805 --> 40:44.107
<i>and make the experience as
stress-free and easy as possible.</i>

40:44.875 --> 40:46.109
[Hulya] Good, you're all done.

40:46.111 --> 40:47.377
Tacoma, water.

40:50.915 --> 40:52.882
He's great with
the other sea lions.

40:52.884 --> 40:55.218
Like with the kids,
he plays with them for hours.

40:55.853 --> 40:56.986
It's really fun to watch.

40:56.988 --> 40:58.555
[Tacoma barking]

40:58.557 --> 41:00.924
[Jim] Hopefully he'll
father some pups here.

41:00.926 --> 41:02.292
[Hulya] Yeah, I hope so.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.294
[Tacoma barking]

41:05.563 --> 41:08.164
And he's almost
just as loud as Clyde was.

41:08.166 --> 41:09.966
[Hulya and Jim laughing]

41:10.901 --> 41:13.236
Both Clyde and Tacoma
come to us as rescues.

41:13.238 --> 41:15.371
We integrated
them with our population,

41:15.373 --> 41:17.674
and these two
animals brought genes

41:17.676 --> 41:20.210
to our gene pool
that were not here before.

41:20.212 --> 41:23.246
<i>They're helping us
ensure that we have a healthy</i>

41:23.248 --> 41:25.215
<i>sea lion
population into the future,</i>

41:25.217 --> 41:27.550
<i>so that we can
continue to tell the story</i>

41:27.552 --> 41:29.319
<i>of sea lions in the wild,</i>

41:29.321 --> 41:32.422
and the challenges they face
because of human activity.

41:33.057 --> 41:34.891
[Tacoma barking]

41:34.893 --> 41:36.826
[Hulya] He's not a shy sea lion.

41:36.828 --> 41:37.827
[Jim] I can see that.

41:37.829 --> 41:39.195
[Hulya] Yeah.

41:39.197 --> 41:40.530
[Jim] He's having a good time.

41:40.532 --> 41:41.564
[Tacoma barking]
