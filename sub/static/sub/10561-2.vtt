00:52.020 --> 00:53.988
- Now, Henry.
- Sir, I...

00:54.022 --> 00:56.491
It's all right. Don't be afraid.

00:58.427 --> 01:00.728
- Ha, ha, ha!
- What's that, sir?

01:00.763 --> 01:03.898
Something I've been experimenting with.

01:03.932 --> 01:06.066
It's an Induction Balance Machine.

01:06.101 --> 01:08.635
Okay, sir. And it turns on lights, does it?

01:08.670 --> 01:10.604
'Cause, we have switches for that...

01:10.638 --> 01:13.774
- It's capable of far more than that, Henry.
- Sir?

01:13.841 --> 01:17.311
- It seems there's been a... Sweet mother of... !
- You see,

01:17.345 --> 01:20.947
it can detect metal. It could
be useful in gathering evidence.

01:20.981 --> 01:23.449
Sir, make it stop... please.

01:25.452 --> 01:28.854
- What have you, George?
- Sir,

01:28.922 --> 01:31.924
there's been a murder at the Palace Hotel.

01:54.655 --> 01:57.456
Toronto Constabulary!

01:57.523 --> 02:00.559
In a minute.

02:00.627 --> 02:03.929
What the devil... ? 

02:03.997 --> 02:08.067
Stop knocking, for the love of God!

02:11.137 --> 02:13.104
Detective Murdoch, Toronto Constabulary.

02:13.171 --> 02:15.272
Yes. You've made that deafeningly clear.

02:15.340 --> 02:18.743
- We've had a call.
- What the devil?

02:18.811 --> 02:22.346
- Reginald! My God, Reginald.
- Please. Please.

02:22.414 --> 02:25.116
Don't touch the body. Do
you know who this man is?

02:25.183 --> 02:28.184
His name is Reginald Mayfair.

02:28.252 --> 02:31.154
- He was a friend.
- And you are?

02:31.188 --> 02:35.158
Churchill. Winston Churchill.

02:42.448 --> 02:45.417
What happened here last
night, Mr. Churchill?

02:45.485 --> 02:48.220
I... I don't know.

02:48.255 --> 02:52.157
- We went for drinks last night.
- And... ?

02:52.225 --> 02:54.893
That's all I remember.

02:54.927 --> 02:56.895
Doctor?

02:56.929 --> 02:59.597
Rigor mortis is just setting in.

02:59.664 --> 03:02.733
Death would have occurred
sometime last night. He suffered

03:02.801 --> 03:04.936
a superficial wound to the forearm.

03:04.970 --> 03:07.338
But that's not what killed him.

03:07.373 --> 03:09.707
It looks like he was killed by a knife.

03:09.775 --> 03:11.708
A very large knife.

03:11.742 --> 03:13.743
Possibly even a sword.

03:13.811 --> 03:15.345
A sword?

03:15.380 --> 03:19.082
Sir.

03:19.117 --> 03:21.518
I found this in the bedroom.

03:22.987 --> 03:24.955
Mr. Churchill,

03:24.989 --> 03:27.723
I'm afraid you are going to
have to come down to the station.

03:36.266 --> 03:38.834
Murdoch! You've got Winston
Churchill locked up in our cells!

03:38.868 --> 03:42.571
- He's awaiting my interview, sir. He's a suspect in the case.
- A suspect?

03:42.605 --> 03:45.140
A suspect? He's Winston bloody Churchill.

03:45.174 --> 03:47.442
He's in town to deliver a lecture tonight.

03:47.476 --> 03:49.610
He may not make his lecture, sir.

03:49.645 --> 03:51.913
The murder weapon may be a sword,

03:51.948 --> 03:54.782
and a bloody sword was found
in Mr. Churchill's room.

03:54.817 --> 03:56.043
What does he say about it?

03:56.044 --> 03:58.188
He doesn't remember a
thing. He'd been drinking.

03:58.587 --> 04:01.888
I've been there. Trust me,
Murdoch. Murder isn't in the man.

04:01.923 --> 04:04.058
- I've read his stuff.
- As have I, sir.

04:04.092 --> 04:07.627
All of the newspapers carried his
account of his escape from the Boers.

04:07.662 --> 04:10.530
Oh, everyone goes on and on about
his escape from the bloody Boers.

04:10.565 --> 04:12.866
It's his battle stories you should read.

04:12.900 --> 04:15.101
They send shivers down your spine.

04:15.135 --> 04:17.236
Did you know he was in the
cavalry charge at Omdurman?

04:17.271 --> 04:20.139
400 Lancers against 3,000 crazed Dervishes.

04:20.173 --> 04:23.409
Limbs flying everywhere. Bracing stuff!

04:25.346 --> 04:28.281
You don't suppose he'd be willing
to sign my autograph book, do you?

04:32.918 --> 04:35.753
Reginald Mayfair and I met in the Sudan.

04:35.788 --> 04:39.358
He was with the infantry.
I was with the cavalry.

04:39.425 --> 04:42.760
After the campaign, he emigrated to Canada.

04:42.828 --> 04:45.130
Naturally we arranged to meet up

04:45.198 --> 04:47.699
once I arrived in Toronto.

04:47.733 --> 04:49.801
Mr. Churchill,

04:49.835 --> 04:51.836
what can you tell us about last night?

04:51.904 --> 04:54.706
We met at my hotel.

04:54.773 --> 04:57.241
We had brandy and cigars.

04:57.275 --> 05:01.746
Then we went to Reginald's club and...

05:01.814 --> 05:05.482
That's it? That's all you remember?

05:05.517 --> 05:08.451
Until I was awakened by
your knock this morning.

05:10.788 --> 05:13.456
- The sword in your room?
- I've never seen it before.

05:13.525 --> 05:15.458
Gentlemen...

05:15.527 --> 05:17.460
Reginald was my friend.

05:17.529 --> 05:19.529
I would never hurt him,

05:19.596 --> 05:20.488
let alone kill him.

05:20.489 --> 05:22.933
We have no reason to
doubt you, Mr. Churchill.

05:23.099 --> 05:26.468
Nevertheless, until we learn
more about last night's events,

05:26.537 --> 05:29.071
you will be required to stay here.

05:29.139 --> 05:31.140
I should cancel tonight's lecture.

05:31.207 --> 05:33.910
Nonsense. We'll have this
sorted out in no time.

05:33.977 --> 05:37.145
- Sir...
- I have tickets, Murdoch.

05:37.212 --> 05:40.214
If you remember anything,

05:40.282 --> 05:42.250
- anything at all...
- Of course.

05:42.317 --> 05:44.485
Detective,

05:44.520 --> 05:47.255
I want Reginald's killer
brought to justice.

05:47.322 --> 05:50.725
I care more about that than
proving my own innocence.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.726
Mr. Churchill...

05:52.794 --> 05:55.132
I've collected some notable
signatures over the years

05:55.133 --> 05:56.385
and it would be a great honour...

05:56.386 --> 05:59.038
You wish me to sign your autograph book?

05:59.734 --> 06:01.501
If that's no trouble.

06:01.536 --> 06:03.670
I would have thought the
collection of autographs

06:03.704 --> 06:05.905
more the province of pimply boys

06:05.973 --> 06:08.942
and silly girls than a
police inspector tasked

06:08.976 --> 06:11.511
with determining the identity of
the man who murdered my friend!

06:11.579 --> 06:14.414
Why, you... 

06:14.449 --> 06:16.416
Sirs.

06:16.451 --> 06:18.785
I've compared the fingermarks on the
sword to those of Mr. Churchill here.

06:18.792 --> 06:20.893
- And?
- They're a match.

06:20.894 --> 06:21.894
Impossible!

06:22.355 --> 06:24.457
He was my friend.

06:24.524 --> 06:27.226
Be that as it may, facts are facts.

06:27.260 --> 06:29.462
Unless you can explain to us how
that sword got into your hand,

06:29.529 --> 06:31.863
then you're looking good for the murder.

06:31.931 --> 06:35.766
Perhaps I was a little hasty in suggesting
that you might make that lecture tonight.

06:35.801 --> 06:38.536
I suggest you sit back down.

06:43.775 --> 06:45.743
He was a young man.

06:45.777 --> 06:48.813
Not a lot of adipose tissue
to insulate the corpse.

06:48.847 --> 06:50.814
And given the nature of his wound,

06:50.848 --> 06:53.638
I think we can assume that death
would have followed within minutes,

06:53.642 --> 06:57.921
-  if not seconds, after the blow.
- And?

06:57.875 --> 07:00.544
So assuming a constant room
temperature of 70 degrees,

07:00.578 --> 07:02.646
I've determined that the
fatal incident occurred

07:02.680 --> 07:05.381
between 1:30 and 2:00 last night.

07:05.416 --> 07:07.417
And the wounds?

07:07.451 --> 07:10.686
As you know, there were
two. The one to the forearm

07:10.720 --> 07:13.322
is superficial, but it
would have been bloody.

07:13.357 --> 07:16.092
He also has some bruising
around his left eye.

07:16.126 --> 07:18.694
- Suggesting he was in a fist fight.
- Yes.

07:18.728 --> 07:20.996
But given the extent of the contusion,

07:21.031 --> 07:24.066
I'd estimate that occurred at
least an hour before his death.

07:24.100 --> 07:26.768
And the fatal wound?

07:26.802 --> 07:28.937
Yes. I think you'll find
this very interesting.

07:28.971 --> 07:32.407
The incision is two inches in width.

07:32.442 --> 07:35.444
The weapon entered just
below the sternum, and exited

07:35.478 --> 07:37.711
between the 7th and 8th costal.

07:37.779 --> 07:40.247
He was run through!

07:40.282 --> 07:42.550
Whoever did this certainly
meant to kill him.

07:42.617 --> 07:46.320
Then we know for certain the
murder weapon was a sword.

07:47.422 --> 07:50.924
Thank you.

07:53.627 --> 07:56.963
- Ah, so that's the murder weapon, is it?
- Possibly, sir.

07:57.030 --> 07:58.931
But have a look at this.

07:58.966 --> 08:01.968
If this sword was used
to run the man through,

08:02.035 --> 08:05.505
wouldn't there be blood across the
entire width, not just the edge?

08:05.573 --> 08:08.874
- Perhaps he wiped it clean?
- Then why not wipe the entire sword?

08:08.942 --> 08:10.875
He was drunk.

08:10.943 --> 08:13.042
Sirs, Churchill's valet is here.

08:13.043 --> 08:14.879
He's brought Mr. Churchill
some fresh clothes.

08:14.914 --> 08:17.048
He has a bloody valet, does he?

08:17.117 --> 08:19.050
Sir, I can't help but notice...

08:19.119 --> 08:21.920
it seems you've turned against your hero.

08:21.988 --> 08:24.856
I'd forgotten what an
arrogant toff he actually is.

08:24.924 --> 08:27.225
He travels with bloody
servants, for God sakes.

08:27.292 --> 08:29.827
Real men carry their own bags, Murdoch.

08:29.894 --> 08:32.763
- Uh...
- Thank you, sir.

08:32.831 --> 08:34.765
Ahem.

08:34.832 --> 08:36.174
We met in the Sudan two years ago.

08:36.174 --> 08:38.225
I've worked for him since that time.

08:38.504 --> 08:42.139
During that time, have you
ever known him to experience

08:42.173 --> 08:45.275
alcohol-induced memory loss?

08:45.343 --> 08:49.045
Mr. Churchill doesn't remember
anything of last night's events.

08:49.113 --> 08:52.715
- None at all?
- None that he'll admit to.

08:52.750 --> 08:56.719
Well, I will say this. If Mr.
Churchill tells you he cannot remember,

08:56.787 --> 09:00.256
then you can take him at
his word. He never lies.

09:00.323 --> 09:04.092
Not even to spare one's feelings.

09:04.161 --> 09:06.094
Um...

09:06.129 --> 09:08.631
What can you tell me about
last night's events? Not much,

09:08.698 --> 09:12.834
I am afraid. I escorted Mr. Churchill
and Mr. Mayfair to the Albany Club.

09:12.869 --> 09:15.203
Mr. Churchill dismissed me after that.

09:15.237 --> 09:17.205
What time was this?

09:17.239 --> 09:19.474
Approximately nine o'clock.

09:24.146 --> 09:26.847
Thank you, Mr. Ahmadi.

09:26.915 --> 09:28.849
The constable will take the
rest of your information.

09:28.884 --> 09:31.718
And remember, if there's
anything else that you recall,

09:31.752 --> 09:35.489
- please don't hesitate to contact me.
- Of course.

09:37.458 --> 09:40.561
Sir, according to guests

09:40.595 --> 09:43.463
staying next to Churchill's
suite, there was loud voices

09:43.498 --> 09:46.332
and clashing sounds at around 1:45 AM.

09:46.366 --> 09:48.634
We also have a witness who claims

09:48.669 --> 09:50.328
that she saw a man leaving
Churchill's suite

09:50.329 --> 09:52.157
shortly thereafter at 2 AM.

09:52.162 --> 09:55.308
- Did she offer a description?
- Only that he was Negro.

09:55.342 --> 09:58.010
- That narrows the list.
- Excuse me.

09:58.044 --> 10:01.046
I couldn't help but overhear.

10:01.081 --> 10:03.682
I should tell you that Mr.
Churchill's boot man is negro.

10:03.716 --> 10:06.251
His name is Jim Carver.

10:06.285 --> 10:09.821
- Thank you, Mr. Ahmadi.
- Crabtree, find Mr. Carver.

10:09.855 --> 10:13.325
I'd like to take a crack at him.
Oh, and bring the witness in as well.

10:13.359 --> 10:15.427
Sir.

10:20.798 --> 10:22.766
Is that the man that you saw

10:22.800 --> 10:25.269
leaving Mr. Churchill's suite last night?

10:25.303 --> 10:28.706
Yes. That's him.

10:28.740 --> 10:31.375
I didn't kill anybody.

10:31.409 --> 10:34.544
I was just there to polish
Mr. Churchill's boots.

10:34.578 --> 10:37.913
- At two o'clock in the morning?
- He always likes his boots waiting for him

10:37.948 --> 10:41.517
first thing in the morning. I didn't
want to have to get up that early.

10:41.552 --> 10:44.520
- Was Mr. Churchill in his room at the time?
- Yes,

10:44.555 --> 10:45.558
I heard him snoring.

10:45.559 --> 10:47.884
And you didn't notice a
dead body lying on the floor?

10:48.325 --> 10:51.126
Mr. Churchill always leaves
his boots right by the door.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.053
That's where I polished them,
right out in the hallway.

10:53.054 --> 10:54.054
What time was this?

10:54.330 --> 10:57.466
Round about 2:30.

10:57.500 --> 11:02.036
- Not two o'clock?
- No, sir. I was still out at that time.

11:08.843 --> 11:11.845
- It's not him.
- I agree. He's only been in Mr. Churchill's employ

11:11.913 --> 11:14.448
for two weeks. He didn't
even know Reginald Mayfair.

11:14.483 --> 11:16.484
Well, what about the time discrepancy?

11:16.551 --> 11:19.620
Perhaps the witness was in error.
You say she identified Jim Carver

11:19.688 --> 11:22.855
- as the man she saw leaving.
- Yet he's adamant he didn't arrive at the hotel

11:22.890 --> 11:25.625
- until 2:30.
- Sirs.

11:25.693 --> 11:28.728
Sirs, it's Mr. Churchill.

11:28.796 --> 11:32.265
He's demanding an
audience. Demanding, is he?

11:32.333 --> 11:35.101
- I'll give him bloody demanding.
- Sir...

11:35.169 --> 11:38.304
Detective. I've found a clue!

11:38.371 --> 11:40.306
I found this in my pocket.

11:40.373 --> 11:42.675
It's a match cover. What about it?

11:42.742 --> 11:45.177
Look inside.

11:45.211 --> 11:48.441
- Vinwosni.
- It must be a name of some sort.

11:48.443 --> 11:50.916
What kind of name is Vinwosni?

11:50.983 --> 11:54.285
Indian, possibly? I spent some
time in India with the 4th Hussars.

11:54.320 --> 11:56.788
We had a Vosniak, didn't we?

11:56.855 --> 11:59.023
- Yes, sir. Wosniak.
- Wosniak.

11:59.090 --> 12:01.959
Polish chap. Perhaps it's Van Wosni.

12:01.993 --> 12:04.061
Gentlemen, we need to
find this Vinwosni fellow.

12:04.129 --> 12:06.631
He may be able to shed some
light on what happened last night.

12:11.736 --> 12:14.037
Sirs, I was unable to find
anybody by the name of Vinwosni

12:14.104 --> 12:16.039
- on public records.
- It must mean something!

12:16.106 --> 12:18.041
I'm beginning to wonder if
it's not the name of a person,

12:18.075 --> 12:20.477
but of an exotic foreign dish,

12:20.545 --> 12:23.046
- you know...
- So where do we go from here?

12:23.080 --> 12:25.648
- I'll make inquiries at the gentlemen's club.
- Take me with you.

12:25.682 --> 12:27.650
- Not bloody likely.
- Please.

12:27.684 --> 12:30.553
What is the benefit of
keeping me behind bars

12:30.587 --> 12:32.722
while his killer struts about freely?

12:32.789 --> 12:34.724
I'm Winston Churchill.

12:34.791 --> 12:37.360
- I'm hardly going to make a run for it.
- Tell that to the Boers.

12:37.427 --> 12:40.295
That was different! I
was a prisoner of war.

12:40.330 --> 12:43.598
Clearly I'm the most valuable
witness to last night's events.

12:43.632 --> 12:48.002
Retracing our steps might
jar loose fragments of memory.

12:48.036 --> 12:51.172
He has a point, sir.

12:51.206 --> 12:54.676
Thank you, gentlemen.

12:54.710 --> 12:58.011
My good man, will you be so kind
as to fetch my hat and stick?

13:03.977 --> 13:05.977
I appreciate you releasing
me from jail, Detec... 

13:06.011 --> 13:09.246
Oh look, a bulldog. I always
thought they should be enshrined

13:09.281 --> 13:11.482
as our national symbol.

13:11.516 --> 13:13.384
- Because of their stubborn tenacity?
- No,

13:13.418 --> 13:15.286
because they look so much like our queen.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.154
Of course,

13:17.189 --> 13:19.156
given my fondness for food and drink,

13:19.191 --> 13:21.157
I may end up looking
like one myself someday.

13:22.660 --> 13:25.629
Anyway, onwards.

13:25.663 --> 13:28.465
I've been here.

13:28.499 --> 13:30.433
Well, yes, I suppose you would have.

13:30.468 --> 13:32.636
The Albany Club is just around the corner.

13:32.670 --> 13:35.505
I'm inside the penumbra
of memory, Detective.

13:35.539 --> 13:37.506
It's coming back to me.

13:37.540 --> 13:40.610
Excellent.

13:45.649 --> 13:48.317
Ah, welcome back, Mr. Churchill.

13:48.351 --> 13:52.154
- Splendid speech, m'boy.
- Gave us genuine pause, it did.

13:52.188 --> 13:55.389
I'm sorry. I don't remember.

13:55.424 --> 13:58.459
Mr. Churchill has no recollection
of last night's events.

13:58.494 --> 14:01.262
- Oh, had a merry one, did you?
- Don't worry, my boy,

14:01.296 --> 14:03.264
we've all been there. 

14:03.298 --> 14:05.934
If memory serves, you
were halfway there already.

14:05.968 --> 14:09.103
- Gentlemen, what did happen?
- Reginald came in

14:09.170 --> 14:12.673
with Mr. Churchill, and
Edward here shouted out:

14:12.741 --> 14:16.510
"Hail to the men who
exacted Gordon's revenge."

14:16.577 --> 14:18.545
General Gordon. He was the Governor

14:18.579 --> 14:20.514
- in the Sudan back in '84.
- Beheaded, he was.

14:20.581 --> 14:22.382
By the Dervishes.

14:22.416 --> 14:26.052
- Led by the fanatical Mahdi, as I recall.
- It took 13 years,

14:26.120 --> 14:30.023
but Lord Kitchener finally defeated
the Dervishes at the battle of Omdurman.

14:30.090 --> 14:33.626
- Was that the revenge to which you were referring?
- Nay.

14:33.694 --> 14:37.363
It was the revenge against the
Mahdi himself that we hailed you for.

14:37.430 --> 14:39.866
But the Mahdi was already dead.

14:39.933 --> 14:43.368
Yes, and after the battle,
Kitchener raided his tomb.

14:43.435 --> 14:45.737
Disinterred his corpse and
had it thrown in the Nile.

14:45.805 --> 14:50.275
But not before he bestowed upon Reginald
the dubious honour of removing his skull.

14:50.342 --> 14:53.244
- Good Lord.
- Kitchener intended to use it

14:53.312 --> 14:55.213
as an inkpot.

14:55.281 --> 14:56.547
We all thought it splendid stuff.

14:56.548 --> 14:59.434
- Tit for tat and all that.
- And I spoke against it.

14:59.435 --> 15:02.186
- You remember?
- No, but it's what I would have done.

15:02.220 --> 15:05.422
You didn't speak against
it, sir. You roared!

15:09.695 --> 15:12.362
This act. This act you hail so heartily

15:12.430 --> 15:14.363
was barbarous.

15:15.231 --> 15:16.239
Shameful.

15:17.902 --> 15:20.336
It degraded not just the
men who committed it...

15:20.404 --> 15:22.605
it degraded every man,

15:22.639 --> 15:25.441
woman, and child of the British Empire.

15:25.509 --> 15:28.144
You shamed us, sir.

15:28.179 --> 15:31.613
Yes. It was a shame we deserved.

15:31.681 --> 15:34.717
You spoke about what it was to be British.

15:34.784 --> 15:36.785
How an empire

15:36.820 --> 15:38.787
brings with it not only glory,

15:38.855 --> 15:41.623
but a grave responsibility to
bring civilization to the world.

15:41.657 --> 15:45.927
Barbarism is a trait which
lessens us as a people.

15:45.961 --> 15:49.931
It makes us no better than our enemies.

15:49.965 --> 15:52.566
We are Britons. Not thugs.

15:52.601 --> 15:55.002
We are civilization!

15:56.881 --> 15:59.317
God bless me, I had tears in my eyes.

15:59.351 --> 16:03.424
- Yes. I believe even Reginald was moved.
- Where is young Reggie, anyway?

16:03.519 --> 16:06.289
He's dead. Murdered.

16:06.324 --> 16:08.124
Oh, good God in heaven!

16:08.159 --> 16:10.860
Yes, gentlemen. That is why we are here.

16:10.894 --> 16:13.396
We're trying to piece together
what happened last night.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.765
There's not much to say, I'm afraid.

16:15.799 --> 16:19.468
You and Reginald had
cigars, had a few drinks,

16:19.502 --> 16:21.870
and then left. No hostilities?

16:21.904 --> 16:25.474
- No. Everyone seemed very jolly.
- Mm-hmm.

16:25.508 --> 16:27.376
Do you know where they went?

16:27.410 --> 16:29.511
Did anyone follow them?

16:29.545 --> 16:32.481
Anyone here by the name of Vinwosni?

16:32.515 --> 16:35.816
Vinwosni? What the devil
kind of name is that?

16:35.851 --> 16:39.720
People have the impression
that battle is glorious.

16:39.754 --> 16:42.790
I myself was once invested
in the same impression.

16:42.824 --> 16:46.160
At Omdurman, we faced 50,000 Dervishes

16:46.195 --> 16:49.096
attacking in a front a half-mile wide,

16:49.130 --> 16:51.131
all cheering for God, his prophet

16:51.165 --> 16:53.133
and the Holy Khalifa.

16:53.167 --> 16:56.736
In any other century, it would
have made a terrifying spectacle.

16:56.804 --> 16:58.555
They never stood a chance.

16:59.431 --> 17:02.476
Artillery and maxim
guns tore them to pieces.

17:02.543 --> 17:05.077
They never got closer than 50 yards.

17:05.145 --> 17:07.179
Kitchener then executed

17:07.214 --> 17:09.748
the wounded and dying.

17:09.781 --> 17:14.353
There was no glory in that victory.

17:14.387 --> 17:17.955
What next, Detective? We can't
knock on every door in Toronto

17:17.991 --> 17:20.659
and ask if Reginald and
I dropped in last night.

17:20.727 --> 17:23.528
No. No, we can't. Oh.

17:23.595 --> 17:25.596
- Perhaps a newspaper.
- Ah, good idea.

17:25.631 --> 17:27.365
An advertisement. "50 dollars

17:27.400 --> 17:29.334
for information on the happenstance

17:29.402 --> 17:31.369
of Winston Churchill and his chum... "

17:31.404 --> 17:33.938
No, no. There was an article yesterday

17:34.006 --> 17:36.607
proclaiming your arrival to Toronto.

17:36.675 --> 17:40.344
Perhaps there's also something
about what you were up to last night.

17:40.378 --> 17:42.579
Ah.

17:48.719 --> 17:51.755
Bit of a step down from the front page.

17:51.822 --> 17:54.457
"A society party thrown
by Mrs. Gertrude Miller

17:54.525 --> 17:57.093
was enlivened greatly by the arrival... "

17:57.161 --> 17:59.095
Who is Gertrude Miller?

17:59.163 --> 18:01.564
She's one of Toronto's
leading temperance advocates.

18:01.631 --> 18:04.667
- She just lives on Jarvis, around the corner.
- Brilliant, Detective.

18:04.734 --> 18:06.835
Let's go.

18:15.978 --> 18:18.012
Anything?

18:25.520 --> 18:27.354
Mr. Churchill.

18:27.422 --> 18:29.923
Have you come to apologize?

18:29.958 --> 18:32.025
If... necessary.

18:35.097 --> 18:37.268
I believe I've had quite enough
of your apologies, thank you.

18:37.269 --> 18:38.269
Show them the door.

18:41.203 --> 18:44.605
Well. I confess I'm even more curious

18:44.672 --> 18:46.640
- about what happened last night.
- What,

18:46.674 --> 18:48.709
the slap didn't jar your memory?

18:48.776 --> 18:50.711
Can't we bring her to the station

18:50.745 --> 18:52.946
and extract the information directly?

18:52.981 --> 18:55.749
Her fingernails should be easy to pull out.

18:55.783 --> 18:59.051
No. We have an even better witness.

19:02.823 --> 19:05.524
What else can you tell us, Mr. Purcell?

19:05.592 --> 19:07.827
Well, I was just there to cover the party.

19:07.861 --> 19:09.862
I wasn't expecting to
get much copy out of it.

19:09.896 --> 19:11.897
Then you walked through the door.

19:11.932 --> 19:14.232
Why would I attend a temperance party?

19:14.266 --> 19:16.234
Well, I believe you'd been invited.

19:16.268 --> 19:19.137
At any rate, you and your
friend came in half-drunk,

19:19.171 --> 19:22.406
and when you learned there was
no liquor, you bribed the footman

19:22.441 --> 19:24.242
into fetching a bottle of whiskey.

19:26.211 --> 19:28.813
And what was Mrs.
Miller's reaction to that?

19:28.848 --> 19:31.348
Well, that's when the fun started.

19:39.824 --> 19:41.792
Mr. Churchill.

19:41.826 --> 19:44.528
You've brought whiskey to my party?

19:44.562 --> 19:47.930
I had no choice, madam. There
was none here when we arrived.

19:47.965 --> 19:51.734
I'll have you know that abstention
is the philosophy of this house.

19:51.769 --> 19:54.037
I'm sorry. I was unaware.

19:54.181 --> 19:56.115
- Unaware?
- In my experience,

19:56.150 --> 19:59.318
houses are not generally
capable of philosophy.

19:59.352 --> 20:03.188
But it doesn't surprise me,
given their lack of intellect,

20:03.222 --> 20:06.057
that the best they could
muster would be abstention.

20:06.092 --> 20:08.226
Does not the Bible teach us

20:08.294 --> 20:10.695
that alcohol is the enemy to virtue?

20:10.729 --> 20:12.697
Does not the same Bible

20:12.731 --> 20:15.533
also teach us the virtue
of loving our enemies?

20:15.567 --> 20:18.502
I must insist that you put
down that drink at once.

20:18.536 --> 20:20.404
Very well.

20:20.438 --> 20:23.040
Mr. Churchill, you insult me.

20:23.108 --> 20:25.442
Madam, I insulted only
your bovine philosophy.

20:25.510 --> 20:27.144
If I intended to insult you,

20:27.179 --> 20:29.479
I would have called attention
to your bovine intellect.

20:29.514 --> 20:32.016
But I did insult your house,

20:32.083 --> 20:35.185
and, for that slip of
the tongue, I apologize.

20:41.525 --> 20:43.827
Well, that solves one mystery.

20:43.861 --> 20:46.762
- What happened after that?
- Well, you both left...

20:46.797 --> 20:48.331
Rather promptly.

20:48.398 --> 20:52.134
- Where did they go?
- I'm sorry, I have no idea.

20:58.407 --> 21:00.943
- Julia.
- William.

21:00.977 --> 21:03.846
I thought you might be interested
to know that Darcy and I

21:03.913 --> 21:06.914
- are due to see the Judge tomorrow.
- About your annulment.

21:06.949 --> 21:10.184
- But I thought that wasn't until next month?
- Darcy wanted it done

21:10.252 --> 21:14.088
before his trip. To allow the gossip
a chance to dissipate in his absence.

21:14.156 --> 21:16.891
So this time tomorrow...

21:16.959 --> 21:20.228
- I'll be a free woman.
- Detective,

21:20.295 --> 21:23.263
I wonder if I might trouble
you for a word. Mr. Churchill,

21:23.331 --> 21:27.234
- how wonderful to see you again!
- Julia, you've met Mr. Churchill before?

21:27.268 --> 21:29.236
Last night.

21:29.303 --> 21:31.471
Berty and Lois took me out to their
club and Mr. Churchill was there.

21:31.538 --> 21:34.941
Or are you still going by
the name Reginald Mayfair?

21:34.976 --> 21:38.244
Unfortunately, Reginald has been killed.

21:38.278 --> 21:40.445
Oh, how dreadful.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.915
I was calling myself Mayfair?

21:42.983 --> 21:46.185
Your friend thought that given your fame,

21:46.219 --> 21:48.587
it would be better to
sully his name than yours.

21:48.621 --> 21:51.456
Do you know what became of them?

21:51.491 --> 21:53.392
I have no memory of last night.

21:53.426 --> 21:55.459
Mr. Churchill and Mr. Mayfair

21:55.527 --> 21:57.828
were having a grand time
impersonating one another.

21:57.897 --> 22:00.965
It was all good fun until the incident.

22:01.033 --> 22:04.568
- The incident?
- Gertrude Miller's husband showed up

22:04.636 --> 22:06.570
just as we were all leaving.

22:06.605 --> 22:08.839
Mr. Miller?

22:08.908 --> 22:12.642
- Which one of you is Churchill?
- That would be me.

22:16.014 --> 22:17.948
I'll kill you! I will!

22:20.184 --> 22:22.752
Right.

22:22.787 --> 22:24.754
We'll have to have a
little chat with Mr. Miller.

22:28.889 --> 22:31.257
So you admit to punching Mr. Mayfair.

22:31.291 --> 22:35.161
I thought he'd insulted my wife.

22:35.195 --> 22:39.198
For God sakes, I didn't kill the man.

22:39.233 --> 22:41.200
Is he our man?

22:41.235 --> 22:44.336
- Well, he certainly has the motive.
- Sirs,

22:44.371 --> 22:47.839
Doctor, we contacted Mrs.
Miller. According to her,

22:47.874 --> 22:49.911
Mr. Miller came home
directly after the incident

22:49.912 --> 22:51.489
and was with her the rest of the night.

22:51.543 --> 22:53.645
Well, she would say that, wouldn't she?

22:53.679 --> 22:56.248
Still, it will be a hard alibi to break.

22:56.282 --> 22:59.384
I'm sorry, gentlemen, but
I don't think it was him.

22:59.418 --> 23:01.518
His wife had been insulted.

23:01.552 --> 23:02.940
He felt the need to defend her honour.

23:02.941 --> 23:05.302
He did so by punching the
man he thought responsible.

23:05.303 --> 23:08.058
His anger should have been
ameliorated, not intensified.

23:08.093 --> 23:10.995
- I have to agree.
- So where does that leave us?

23:11.029 --> 23:14.298
Right back where we started, I'm afraid.

23:14.332 --> 23:16.300
With Churchill as our number one suspect.

23:16.334 --> 23:18.769
Well, that suits me fine.

23:20.705 --> 23:22.673
Sir,

23:22.707 --> 23:26.410
the few times I've...
imbibed a little too much,

23:26.444 --> 23:28.845
I must admit to a patchy memory.

23:28.879 --> 23:31.315
But forgetting an entire evening?

23:31.382 --> 23:33.916
- Could he have been drugged?
- It's possible.

23:33.983 --> 23:36.018
He could also be suffering
from what is known

23:36.052 --> 23:37.986
as traumatic amnesia.

23:38.054 --> 23:40.956
Because he witnessed
the murder of his friend.

23:41.024 --> 23:42.991
And the reality was so abhorrent to him,

23:43.026 --> 23:45.361
that his unconscious mind has
blocked out all memory of it.

23:45.395 --> 23:47.775
If that is the case, then
the memory is still there.

23:47.776 --> 23:48.776
You just have to unlock it.

23:48.898 --> 23:50.699
How do we do that?

23:50.766 --> 23:54.803
We'd need him to re-experience
anything associated with last night.

23:54.870 --> 23:56.805
If he has any sensation of familiarity,

23:56.872 --> 23:59.441
ask him the first word that comes to mind.

23:59.508 --> 24:01.476
Sir, here is everything

24:01.510 --> 24:03.821
we found in Mr. Churchill's
suite as of this morning.

24:03.822 --> 24:04.822
Thank you, George.

24:06.948 --> 24:08.915
Mr. Churchill,

24:08.950 --> 24:11.352
look closely at this.

24:11.419 --> 24:14.054
What's the first word
that comes to mind? Shame.

24:14.121 --> 24:17.458
- Shame?
- It's a good cigar. Shame it was wasted.

24:17.525 --> 24:20.126
- Mr. Churchill...
- It was the first thought

24:20.161 --> 24:22.595
- that entered my head.
- Try again.

24:22.663 --> 24:24.797
Concentrate on the cigar.

24:24.865 --> 24:28.334
Relax your mind and say the first Match.

24:29.370 --> 24:32.572
Light. Smoke rings. A cigar
is just a bloody cigar.

24:34.775 --> 24:37.576
Sir. Look here. Paper matches.

24:37.643 --> 24:39.811
This is the type they sell at Murphy's pub.

24:39.846 --> 24:41.813
Murphy's pub?

24:41.881 --> 24:43.815
Do you recognize the name?

24:43.883 --> 24:46.150
I don't know.

24:46.218 --> 24:49.488
- What's the first word that comes to mind?
- Rule.

24:49.555 --> 24:53.091
- Rule?
- Britannia.

25:03.001 --> 25:06.236
You again!

25:06.271 --> 25:08.506
You've got a bloody nerve

25:08.540 --> 25:10.507
- coming back in here again.
- Gentlemen, gentlemen,

25:10.541 --> 25:12.575
Toronto Constabulary.

25:12.643 --> 25:16.413
- Still hiding behind John Law, are ya?
- Alright, back off, all of you.

25:16.447 --> 25:18.060
I'll have no more trouble.

25:18.061 --> 25:20.177
- What trouble?
- Why don't you ask him?

25:20.217 --> 25:23.019
- I don't remember.
- Not surprised.

25:23.053 --> 25:25.921
You were falling-down drunk.
As was your jelly-boned friend.

25:27.657 --> 25:31.293
Bartender.

25:31.327 --> 25:34.362
A whiskey for my friend and another for me.

25:34.431 --> 25:36.799
Oy.

25:36.833 --> 25:39.267
This here is an Irish pub.

25:39.302 --> 25:42.637
Make that two Irish whiskeys.

25:42.671 --> 25:46.040
You're not welcome here, friend.

25:46.074 --> 25:49.444
Oh, you're not my friend.
But the rest of these men are.

25:49.478 --> 25:52.146
Drinks on the house! 

25:54.049 --> 25:56.350
Things calmed down for a bit after that.

25:56.984 --> 25:59.352
Until Reagan started singing
his bloody rebel songs.

25:59.353 --> 26:00.353
♪ Go back home ♪

26:00.087 --> 26:02.221
♪ Ye bloody British ♪

26:02.256 --> 26:05.291
♪ Go back home from whence ye came ♪

26:05.326 --> 26:08.161

26:11.165 --> 26:13.132
♪ Britannia rules the waves ♪

26:16.536 --> 26:18.471
Enough!

26:18.505 --> 26:20.473
No more singing.

26:20.507 --> 26:22.641
Get back to your seats.

26:22.676 --> 26:24.910
And that's where it might have ended,

26:24.945 --> 26:26.812
but you...

26:26.847 --> 26:29.748
had to open your big trap.

26:29.783 --> 26:32.150
You should feel honoured

26:32.218 --> 26:35.954
toto be part of the greatest
empire the world has seen.

26:36.022 --> 26:38.556
- Honoured? Where is the honour in being conquered?
- Better to be

26:38.591 --> 26:42.694
the arm of a great beast than
the scat it leaves behind.

26:42.761 --> 26:44.829
Are you calling Ireland scat?

26:44.864 --> 26:48.165
Perhaps you're not familiar
with the concept of metaphor.

26:50.809 --> 26:52.003
Run. Now!

26:53.771 --> 26:55.706
And that's the last I saw of them.

26:55.773 --> 26:58.009
The rest of us chased
them down Queen Street,

26:58.043 --> 27:00.378
until they took refuge behind a copper,

27:00.412 --> 27:03.980
still singing Rule bloody Britannia.

27:05.249 --> 27:07.384
What happened then?

27:07.451 --> 27:11.021
The copper arrested them.

27:11.088 --> 27:15.125
Here it is. 12:45 AM.

27:15.192 --> 27:17.660
They were here. In our cells?

27:17.694 --> 27:20.462
I thought there was something
familiar about this place.

27:20.530 --> 27:24.033
- The arresting officer was...
- Jackson!

27:26.469 --> 27:29.704
Did you arrest this man last night?

27:29.772 --> 27:32.541
- Yeah, him and his friend.
- Bloody hell.

27:32.575 --> 27:35.443
It was for their own
good. Singing Rule Britannia

27:35.511 --> 27:37.378
in Corktown? They were
looking for a beating.

27:37.446 --> 27:39.380
How long were they here?

27:39.448 --> 27:41.549
I kept them in until the bars
closed and then I released them

27:41.616 --> 27:43.651
with a strict warning. No more singing.

27:43.718 --> 27:46.287
- What then?
- I went back on patrol.

27:46.355 --> 27:48.089
Did you see where they went?

27:48.123 --> 27:51.758
- Last I saw they was heading up Parliament Street.
- Parliament Street.

27:51.825 --> 27:53.693
Does that sound familiar?

27:53.761 --> 27:56.329
Say the first thing that comes to mind.

27:56.397 --> 27:58.731
Vinwosni.

27:58.799 --> 28:01.068
There's that name again. I wasn't
thinking about it. It just came out.

28:01.102 --> 28:04.737
Maybe this Vinwosni fellow
lives on that street.

28:04.805 --> 28:07.239
Oh, ho, ho!

28:07.274 --> 28:10.242
Back to work, Jackson.

28:10.310 --> 28:14.180
There's an after-hours speakeasy called

28:14.214 --> 28:16.182
- Insomnia.
- What the devil is he doing?

28:16.216 --> 28:18.417
- Just wait and see, Mr. Churchill.
- We keep shutting it down.

28:18.485 --> 28:21.153
But, it keeps popping back up

28:21.188 --> 28:23.921
with a different sign. This time,

28:23.989 --> 28:27.192
they've inverted the name.

28:36.135 --> 28:39.002
You.

28:39.036 --> 28:41.205
Where's my bloody swords?

28:41.272 --> 28:43.873
Officer swords? Brass hilt?

28:43.908 --> 28:46.343
He knows what they look like.
Those are my Grandpa's swords.

28:46.377 --> 28:48.945
He used them in the War of 1812. And
they've got sentimental value, mate.

28:48.980 --> 28:51.215
Those swords were taken as evidence.

28:51.249 --> 28:53.034
They were used in the
commission of a crime.

28:53.035 --> 28:54.349
Would that crime be murder?

28:54.351 --> 28:56.486
Why would you ask that?

28:56.520 --> 28:58.488
Well, the way you and your friend
were going at it last night,

28:58.522 --> 29:01.690
I figured one of you would kill
the other. Ain't that right, Al?

29:01.725 --> 29:03.559
Yup.

29:03.594 --> 29:07.062
Tell me everything you
remember about last night.

29:08.332 --> 29:11.566
Barkeep. Some whiskey, if you please.

29:11.601 --> 29:14.636
You no sooner sat down
than you started in arguing.

29:14.670 --> 29:18.673
- About what?
- About some gal named...

29:18.707 --> 29:19.772
Maddie.

29:21.710 --> 29:24.312
Your friend had done
something terrible to her.

29:24.347 --> 29:27.714
But felt he was justified on account of
what she had done to his friend, Gordon.

29:27.782 --> 29:31.652
- That about sum it up, Al?
-  Yup.

29:31.686 --> 29:34.454
Reginald and I often debated the
desecration of the Mahdi's tomb.

29:34.522 --> 29:37.490
- We'd never come to blows over it.
- Oh, it didn't end there.

29:37.525 --> 29:40.027
- Then he started jibbing you about your mother.
- My mother?

29:40.061 --> 29:42.062
Yeah, your mother.

29:42.096 --> 29:45.098
All I'm saying is she
has a reputation, old boy.

29:45.133 --> 29:48.468
She's getting married to a man half
her age. What does that tell you?

29:48.502 --> 29:51.671
That love is not determined
by the year of one's birth.

29:51.705 --> 29:54.540
Well, it tells me she needed
someone who could keep up with her.

29:56.476 --> 29:58.678
Weapon of choice, sir.

29:58.745 --> 30:02.048
Are you... challenging me to a duel?

30:10.156 --> 30:12.657
Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing?!

30:12.725 --> 30:14.693
- Then what?
- Then they left... 

30:14.760 --> 30:18.163
and they took my bloody swords with them.

30:24.503 --> 30:27.505
Take me in, Detective.

30:27.573 --> 30:33.477
It would appear

30:30.108 --> 30:33.477
that I am the man we are seeking.

30:42.371 --> 30:44.305
Julia.

30:44.373 --> 30:46.307
What is it?

30:46.342 --> 30:49.878
I couldn't do it.

30:49.945 --> 30:51.880
I couldn't lie.

30:51.947 --> 30:55.415
Julia, please speak plainly to me.

30:55.449 --> 30:58.151
The judge didn't grant the annulment.

30:58.219 --> 31:00.520
Why not?

31:04.625 --> 31:06.659
Oh, William, it was all my fault.

31:06.694 --> 31:09.061
He asked me, under oath,

31:09.096 --> 31:11.364
if we'd consummated our marriage.

31:11.431 --> 31:13.565
And I couldn't do it. I couldn't lie.

31:13.633 --> 31:16.903
- I couldn't do that to Darcy.
- I see.

31:16.970 --> 31:19.272
But Darcy says he'll consider a divorce.

31:19.339 --> 31:21.073
A divorce.

31:21.108 --> 31:24.243
Does it really make a difference?

31:24.278 --> 31:27.812
We can still be together.
We can legally marry.

31:27.846 --> 31:30.148
But not in the eyes of God.

31:30.182 --> 31:33.184
Then damn God, William.

31:33.252 --> 31:35.233
You know I've been intimate with men.

31:35.234 --> 31:37.346
And now I'm going to be
divorced. You know this!

31:37.456 --> 31:39.791
- Julia, please...
- This is who I am.

31:39.825 --> 31:41.792
This is the woman you say you love!

31:41.826 --> 31:43.928
- This isn't easy...
- I can deal

31:43.962 --> 31:46.030
with the legal matters. You
work it out with your God.

31:56.741 --> 31:58.808
I almost feel sorry for him.

31:58.842 --> 32:01.677
Hell of a thing to kill your own
friend and not even remember it.

32:01.711 --> 32:04.347
Then again, maybe it's best not
to remember something like that.

32:04.381 --> 32:07.984
The memory loss could be caused by
something called traumatic amnesia.

32:08.018 --> 32:10.987
Few things would be more
traumatic. It's a shame.

32:11.021 --> 32:13.521
I had a feeling this Churchill
fellow was going places.

32:13.556 --> 32:16.391
Detective. Do you have a minute?

32:18.328 --> 32:22.230
Before I closed the Y-incision,
I thought I would weigh the liver.

32:22.265 --> 32:25.100
Not strictly necessary,
given the cause of death

32:25.134 --> 32:26.734
was obvious.

32:26.769 --> 32:28.803
But I was curious to see the
immediate effects on the liver

32:28.838 --> 32:31.005
of a bout of heavy drinking.

32:31.073 --> 32:33.807
- Go on.
- And that's when I noticed

32:33.842 --> 32:36.710
that the stomach was nicked.

32:36.744 --> 32:38.412
I thought at first I had done it myself

32:38.447 --> 32:41.048
during the excision. But just to be sure,

32:41.116 --> 32:44.085
I decided to track the passage
of the sword through the body.

32:44.119 --> 32:46.119
I'd thought about doing that anyway.

32:46.187 --> 32:48.855
Not very often one gets a
chance to track a sword wound.

32:48.889 --> 32:50.656
Go on...

32:50.724 --> 32:53.193
I'll show you.

32:56.364 --> 32:58.298
The sword entered here

32:58.366 --> 33:02.301
and exited here.

33:02.335 --> 33:05.237
Detective. The top of the stomach

33:05.305 --> 33:07.373
sits here.

33:07.407 --> 33:09.808
So how did this sword nick a stomach

33:09.842 --> 33:13.479
that was sitting at least an inch
lower than the bottom of the blade?

33:13.546 --> 33:15.547
- It couldn't have.
- Exactly.

33:15.581 --> 33:18.483
It is my conclusion that the
sword that killed Mr. Mayfair

33:18.550 --> 33:20.851
was curved.

33:22.787 --> 33:24.722
Now you think he's bloody innocent?

33:24.789 --> 33:26.824
Mr. Churchill's sword
was not the murder weapon.

33:26.858 --> 33:28.826
Then how did it get blood on it?

33:28.894 --> 33:31.229
I believe the two men did have a duel

33:31.296 --> 33:33.830
which ended with Mr.
Mayfair's arm being cut.

33:33.898 --> 33:35.775
The spillage of blood no
doubt sobered the men up.

33:36.235 --> 33:38.373
And then someone else came in
after them, with a different sword?

33:38.374 --> 33:39.374
Yes.

33:39.370 --> 33:42.872
How many bloody swords are
there in Toronto, Murdoch?

33:42.907 --> 33:44.335
So we're back where we started.

33:44.336 --> 33:46.371
In fact, we're back where
we started before we started.

33:46.744 --> 33:48.845
I'd like to return to the Palace Hotel

33:48.913 --> 33:50.779
with Mr. Churchill.

33:50.813 --> 33:53.916
- To what end?
- Perhaps I can jar his memory.

33:53.950 --> 33:56.285
If he is suffering from traumatic amnesia,

33:56.319 --> 33:58.720
then perhaps he was a
witness to the murder.

34:02.359 --> 34:04.293
Does anything come to mind, Mr. Churchill?

34:04.394 --> 34:08.295
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
- Sir.

34:08.330 --> 34:09.426
Have a look at this.

34:10.063 --> 34:11.554
It appears to be some sort of writing.

34:11.556 --> 34:12.556
It seems to have blended
into the wallpaper.

34:17.839 --> 34:20.741
Why would somebody bother writing
something so difficult to see?

34:20.775 --> 34:23.810
Because, George when this was written

34:23.844 --> 34:27.081
it would have been bright red. It's blood.

34:27.148 --> 34:29.949
It's since dried to the
same colour as the wallpaper.

34:30.016 --> 34:33.853
I'm going to need my ultraviolet light.

34:33.888 --> 34:37.623
Blood, even dried blood,
fluoresces under ultraviolet light.

34:37.690 --> 34:39.925
- Why blood?
- Not just blood.

34:39.960 --> 34:43.996
- Urine, semen...
- Scorpions... for some reason.

34:44.030 --> 34:47.199
George, if you could get the lights.

34:53.839 --> 34:56.074
Om... Omdurman.

35:04.150 --> 35:06.485
Maybe the killer was taking revenge

35:06.519 --> 35:07.951
for what happened at
the battle of Omdurman.

35:07.952 --> 35:09.215
Or perhaps for the defiling

35:09.354 --> 35:12.123
of the Mahdi's tomb. Reginald
played a part in that.

35:12.157 --> 35:15.792
- Who would know this?
- Everybody at the Albany club.

35:15.827 --> 35:19.363
But who at that club would give
a tuppence for the bloody Mahdi?

35:19.397 --> 35:23.534
But the British Empire is not
what defines us as British.

35:23.568 --> 35:25.701
Not to be praised, or honoured...

35:25.736 --> 35:28.238
Your valet was there.

35:28.272 --> 35:31.407
- The Arab fellow?
- My God.

35:31.442 --> 35:33.409
Gentlemen.

35:33.444 --> 35:35.745
Ahmadi is a Nile Arab.

35:35.779 --> 35:37.847
I met him in Khartoum.

35:37.881 --> 35:39.949
What is more, he's a Mohammedan.

35:41.417 --> 35:44.052
When Kitchener defiled
the tomb, he defiled Islam.

35:44.120 --> 35:46.655
Any Mohammedan would have been enraged.

35:46.689 --> 35:50.725
Let's have a little chat with him.

35:50.760 --> 35:55.230
I'm a Mohammedan, yes, but I'm
not a fanatic. I'm not a Mahdist.

35:55.265 --> 35:57.865
You're from the Sudan, are you not?

35:57.899 --> 36:00.568
- No. I am Egyptian.
- Really?

36:00.602 --> 36:03.237
According to Mr. Churchill,
you met him in Khartoum.

36:03.305 --> 36:05.640
Yes, but I am from Cairo.

36:05.707 --> 36:09.109
Look at my face. Do I look like a Nubian?

36:12.047 --> 36:15.715
- What do you think?
- He's right, sir.

36:15.783 --> 36:19.186
Most Sudanese Arabs have negro features.

36:19.220 --> 36:19.993
Hold it, Murdoch.

36:19.994 --> 36:23.099
Our witness said she saw a Negro
man leaving Churchill's suite.

36:23.257 --> 36:26.293
But she identified the boot
man as the man she saw leaving.

36:26.360 --> 36:30.696
She probably thinks one
looks just like another.

36:34.767 --> 36:38.236
It wasn't the boot man she saw leaving.

36:38.304 --> 36:41.206
It was the killer.

36:41.273 --> 36:44.676
- All I'm saying is she has a reputation, old boy.
- Love is not determined

36:44.711 --> 36:47.079
by the year of one's birth. She's
getting married to a man half her age.

36:49.048 --> 36:50.712
There was a Negro man at the speakeasy.

36:51.273 --> 36:54.819
He would have overheard the argument
about the desecration of Mahdi's tomb.

36:55.121 --> 36:57.247
He would know that Mayfair was responsible.

36:57.248 --> 36:59.820
He could have put the knockout
drug in Mr. Churchill's drink.

37:00.192 --> 37:02.793
Odd that Churchill never
thought to mention him.

37:02.861 --> 37:04.050
He fought against the Sudanese.

37:04.051 --> 37:05.234
He would have known what they looked like.

37:05.530 --> 37:07.832
You're right, sir, that is odd.

37:07.899 --> 37:09.833
George. Sir.

37:09.867 --> 37:11.467
Where is Mr. Churchill now?

37:11.501 --> 37:13.803
He said he wanted to return the swords

37:13.871 --> 37:17.173
to their rightful owner.

37:17.241 --> 37:19.408
Bloody hell.

37:25.882 --> 37:28.683
I've come to bring the swords back.

37:28.752 --> 37:32.420
Keef Halak.

37:34.657 --> 37:37.459
I knew it was you.

37:37.493 --> 37:40.262
I could tell by your face.

37:40.296 --> 37:44.132
Were you at Omdurman? I was.

37:44.166 --> 37:47.568
I've come to bring you to justice.

37:47.636 --> 37:49.670
You can come willingly...

37:49.704 --> 37:53.808
or you can try to stop me.

38:11.558 --> 38:15.327
- All right! Stop!
- Dammit, man! I almost killed you!

38:15.361 --> 38:19.265
- Put down your swords.
- I'll stop if he stops. I doubt he will... he'll hang either way.

38:20.267 --> 38:22.467
So the way I see it. This is self-defence.

38:22.502 --> 38:24.970
- This is revenge.
- Call it what you like, old boy.

38:42.421 --> 38:44.322
Enough! 

38:48.426 --> 38:52.029
- Kill him and you're dead.
- I am dead anyway.

38:52.063 --> 38:55.432
This is for my people, whom
you degraded and slaughtered.

38:55.466 --> 38:58.401
For your insult to the Mahdi and Allah.

38:58.436 --> 39:01.103
The man you're about to kill

39:01.138 --> 39:03.873
spoke out against what happened
at the battle of Omdurman.

39:03.941 --> 39:07.543
He praised the Mahdi. Called
him a priest, a soldier

39:07.577 --> 39:10.512
and a patriot. You're quoting my book!

39:10.547 --> 39:13.415
Now, you can choose to
die as a man of honour

39:13.450 --> 39:16.752
or as a murderer. Your choice.

39:31.467 --> 39:34.801
This fight is not over.

39:53.163 --> 39:55.097
He fought with the Mahdi.

39:55.165 --> 39:57.499
He was there when Kitchener
desecrated the tomb.

39:57.566 --> 39:59.802
What the hell is he doing here?

39:59.869 --> 40:01.936
He killed one of the officers responsible.

40:01.970 --> 40:04.538
He escaped through French North
Africa, boarded a merchant ship,

40:04.606 --> 40:07.842
landed here in Toronto where
he took up a job as a barman.

40:07.910 --> 40:11.712
And a year later another toffy-nosed
Redcoat comes waltzing through his door,

40:11.780 --> 40:15.016
bragging about how he's turned
his Messiah's skull into an inkpot.

40:15.083 --> 40:18.151
- What are the odds on that?
- I suppose remote enough

40:18.219 --> 40:21.855
that he considered it a calling from
God that his work was unfinished.

40:24.658 --> 40:27.694
I've just time to make my lecture.

40:27.761 --> 40:30.730
Inspector, if you'd like me to
sign that autograph book of yours...

40:30.764 --> 40:34.366
What, and join the ranks of
silly girls and pimply boys?

40:34.434 --> 40:38.170
Inspector, of all the insults
I've uttered in the last 24 hours,

40:38.205 --> 40:41.140
that is the one I wish I could forget.

40:41.208 --> 40:44.409
If you still feel my
signature worthy of inclusion,

40:44.444 --> 40:47.012
- I'd be honoured.
- Very well,

40:47.047 --> 40:49.380
if you insist.

40:49.414 --> 40:51.782
Well, you've had an eventful stay,

40:51.817 --> 40:55.519
Mr. Churchill. Perhaps material
for your memoirs someday.

40:55.587 --> 40:58.256
I rather think I'll restrict my memoirs

40:58.290 --> 41:00.758
to the events I actually
remember, Detective.

41:00.792 --> 41:04.229
This hasn't exactly been my finest hour.

41:06.865 --> 41:09.299
Good God. Look at these signatures.

41:09.334 --> 41:11.935
Nikola Tesla,

41:11.970 --> 41:15.138
Harry Houdini, Buffalo
Bill, Arthur Conan Doyle.

41:15.173 --> 41:18.141
Is this the signature
of the Prime Minister?

41:18.176 --> 41:22.178
- I'm not sure I am worthy, Inspector.
- Ah, give it a scribble.

41:22.212 --> 41:26.448
Who knows. Maybe you'll be
Prime Minister yourself someday.

41:28.385 --> 41:30.753
I wish you peace and
good fortune, gentlemen.

41:30.787 --> 41:33.256
It was a pleasure.

41:35.759 --> 41:38.360
Until we meet again.

41:40.296 --> 41:43.365
What did he write?

41:43.399 --> 41:47.168
"To the man who made the rest of my
life possible. Winston Churchill."

41:47.203 --> 41:50.906
Let's hope he makes good use of it.

42:19.166 --> 42:22.302
Five, four, three,

42:22.369 --> 42:24.470
two,

42:24.538 --> 42:27.572
one, good. That's enough for now.

42:28.874 --> 42:32.110
William.

42:32.178 --> 42:34.512
Julia.

42:34.580 --> 42:37.649
I will stand by you.

42:39.218 --> 42:43.154
If you divorce, I will marry you.

42:43.221 --> 42:45.156
And your faith,

42:45.223 --> 42:47.191
how will you reconcile that?

42:47.225 --> 42:50.261
I'll accept the
consequences of my decision.

42:50.329 --> 42:53.564
No matter what the Church says,

42:53.631 --> 42:55.799
I refuse to believe that love,

42:55.867 --> 42:58.268
any love, could be wrong.

42:59.736 --> 43:01.537
And I love you.

43:03.640 --> 43:05.675
And I you.
