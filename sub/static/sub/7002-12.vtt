00:01.533 --> 00:04.836
When do we get to
the cheese?
Soon.

00:06.772 --> 00:10.241
This can't be right.

00:10.242 --> 00:12.276
It's so small.

00:12.277 --> 00:17.849
I had no idea
when I ordered this
that it was actual size.

00:17.850 --> 00:19.985
Come on, come on.
Hurry up. Let's go!

00:19.986 --> 00:21.987
It's about time
for the official lighting

00:21.988 --> 00:24.756
Of the christmas
extravaganza.
Brad! Randy!

00:24.757 --> 00:26.691
They're not here.
Where'd they go?

00:26.692 --> 00:29.260
They're still out
collecting money for
the school christmas drive.

00:29.261 --> 00:31.930
Oh, I can't wait.
They can see it later.
Come on, come on, come on.

00:31.931 --> 00:33.932
Honey, I hope
you didn't get back into

00:33.933 --> 00:36.334
This whole competition thing
with doc johnson this year.

00:36.335 --> 00:39.104
Please. I'm past it, ok?
I've nothing to prove.

00:39.105 --> 00:41.640
This year I'm going
for a low-key approach.

00:41.641 --> 00:44.643
All right,
when I flick the switch,
it's gonna be kind of bright,

00:44.644 --> 00:48.279
So you're gonna need
these sunglasses.
Oh, tim.

00:48.280 --> 00:51.349
Don't look directly
at the snowman.

01:06.498 --> 01:08.900
Mom? Dad?

01:08.901 --> 01:11.002
Where'd you go?
We're still here.

02:20.272 --> 02:23.241
Well, what do you think?
Can we put the kids
in the middle?

02:26.111 --> 02:27.278
Hi.
Hey.

02:27.279 --> 02:28.379
Hey, guys.

02:28.380 --> 02:30.115
Pretty awesome lights
out there, huh?

02:30.116 --> 02:31.850
It's really hot out there.

02:31.851 --> 02:34.853
I don't know if all that straw
around the baby jesus

02:34.854 --> 02:36.855
Is such a great idea.

02:36.856 --> 02:39.423
Randy, he's the son of god.

02:39.424 --> 02:41.059
He'll be fine.

02:43.495 --> 02:45.496
Dad, everyone
in the whole neighborhood

02:45.497 --> 02:47.431
Is standing
outside of our house,

02:47.432 --> 02:49.333
And they don't look
too happy.

02:49.334 --> 02:51.335
Oh, everyone in the whole
neighborhood is out there?

02:51.336 --> 02:53.404
The whole neighborhood's
sitting out there?

02:53.405 --> 02:55.740
Is mrs. Swanson out there
with those stupid drop earrings?

02:55.741 --> 02:57.742
Open the door,
she's right here?

02:57.743 --> 03:00.779
<i>(neighbors shouting</i>
<i>over each other)</i>

03:04.150 --> 03:06.851
You know, maybe I should
put a dimmer on that.

03:06.852 --> 03:09.654
Wouldn't that be a good idea?

03:09.655 --> 03:12.257
So how'd you guys do
on that christmas drive?

03:12.258 --> 03:15.059
You were gone a long time.
You must have been working
really hard.

03:15.060 --> 03:18.062
We walked, like, 300 miles
around the whole neighborhood.

03:18.063 --> 03:20.064
You're doing
a good thing.

03:20.065 --> 03:22.466
Why don't you go wash up
for dinner?

03:23.602 --> 03:25.603
<i>(blender whirring)</i>

03:30.176 --> 03:31.609
Tim!

03:31.610 --> 03:34.612
Honey, can we just turn down
the christmas lights

03:34.613 --> 03:36.614
Till after dinner's cooked?

03:36.615 --> 03:39.818
Maybe that would be
a good idea.
Yeah.

03:43.255 --> 03:44.889
<i>(people cheering)</i>

03:48.227 --> 03:54.132
...86, 87,
88, 89, 90.

03:54.133 --> 03:57.202
$90.24.

03:57.203 --> 03:59.871
Yeah, that's a major amount
of money.

03:59.872 --> 04:02.106
We made 90 bucks.

04:02.107 --> 04:05.476
If we made 90 bucks a day
and worked for 7 days,

04:05.477 --> 04:07.912
We'd make, like, 200 bucks.

04:11.150 --> 04:14.819
Brad, your math tutor
must be proud.

04:16.956 --> 04:20.391
This is more money
than we've ever had
on our bed before.

04:20.392 --> 04:22.393
Yeah, if the money was ours,

04:22.394 --> 04:25.663
We could buy 30
rooster man comic books.

04:25.664 --> 04:28.266
Yeah, we could get
barbarian 2 for game boy.

04:28.267 --> 04:30.068
Yeah.

04:30.069 --> 04:33.137
Too bad you don't get paid
collecting for charity.

04:34.539 --> 04:37.675
If we were working
at our regular jobs,

04:37.676 --> 04:40.245
We'd get paid salary.

04:40.246 --> 04:42.380
How much do you think
dad makes?

04:42.381 --> 04:45.316
I don't know.
3 bucks an hour.

04:46.952 --> 04:49.354
Yeah.

04:49.355 --> 04:51.923
And al does
most of the work.

04:54.760 --> 04:57.896
I mean, we worked hard,
and I'm wearing out my shoes.

04:57.897 --> 04:58.997
So?

04:58.998 --> 05:00.899
So...

05:02.101 --> 05:04.369
Charity, charity,

05:04.370 --> 05:06.070
Two for us.

05:06.071 --> 05:09.107
I don't know. This is all
supposed to go to charity.

05:09.108 --> 05:12.476
It will. I'm just
taking a little bit out
for business expenses.

05:12.477 --> 05:16.381
Besides, mom always says
charity begins at home.

05:19.285 --> 05:20.885
Oh, tim, there you are.

You joined a convent

06:15.674 --> 06:20.544
No, silly. I have booked some
very special musical guests
for our christmas show.

06:20.545 --> 06:21.980

Tim, are you forgetting?

06:29.888 --> 06:32.490
Besides, who did you
want me to book -

06:32.491 --> 06:34.825
Those musical barking dogs
that sing "jingle bells"?

06:34.826 --> 06:38.762
Yes! We've been trying
to get them for three years.

06:38.763 --> 06:40.698
They won't do
a cable show.

06:40.699 --> 06:43.267
Ok, now, come on.

What?

gave him some christmas money
last weekend.

my christmas present.

How could they afford that?
They're saving
their allowance or something.

its own built-in alarm.

Take the cake,
stick it on a cow's horn,

11:37.862 --> 11:39.997
Then they throw cider
in her face.

flicks the cake forward,

a very good harvest.

12:08.427 --> 12:10.728
Wait a minute.
Did you say $10?

12:10.729 --> 12:14.365
All the cash I had, jill.
They wouldn't take a check.

12:14.366 --> 12:16.567
Well, <i>feliz navidad,</i>
good neighbors.

12:16.568 --> 12:19.970
<i>♪ off I go a-wassailing,</i>
<i>a-wassailing... ♪</i>

12:19.971 --> 12:21.839
Did you hear that?

12:21.840 --> 12:25.509
I sure did. He can't
carry a tune at all.

12:25.510 --> 12:28.312
No, he said
that he gave them $10.

12:28.313 --> 12:31.482
Tim, they told me
that they only collected $5
the whole morning.

12:31.483 --> 12:32.916
Ho-ho-ho.

12:32.917 --> 12:36.119
The watch, the video game,
the comic books...

12:36.120 --> 12:38.121
They're stealing
from the charity

12:38.122 --> 12:41.325
Or-or from your dresser drawer
or something.

12:41.326 --> 12:45.162
I don't leave any money
in my dresser drawer.
<i>You</i> take it.

12:45.163 --> 12:47.798
Well, then they're stealing
from the charity.

12:58.276 --> 13:01.912
I found this
in bugsy's drawer.

13:01.913 --> 13:05.148
These were
in baby face's dresser.

13:05.149 --> 13:07.150
Wait till I get my hands
on those...

13:07.151 --> 13:10.153
And I found this
in brad's little book bag.

13:10.154 --> 13:12.956
A locket.
Maybe your christmas present?

13:12.957 --> 13:16.560
How nice. I can put
their little mug shots in it.

13:20.365 --> 13:21.899
What are we gonna say
to them?

13:21.900 --> 13:23.901
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna say.

13:23.902 --> 13:26.704
"the locket goes back.
Thanks for the watch."

13:28.673 --> 13:29.807
Hi. We're home.

13:29.808 --> 13:32.710
Well, well, well,
look who's home.

13:32.711 --> 13:34.478
How did it go?

13:34.479 --> 13:36.680
Oh, ok.

13:36.681 --> 13:39.049
How much money you think
you brought in today?

13:39.050 --> 13:42.219
Around $20.

13:42.220 --> 13:45.823
So with the five
that you brought in
this morning,

13:45.824 --> 13:47.425
That would make 25?

13:47.426 --> 13:50.394
Yeah. That's a lot, huh?

13:50.395 --> 13:52.963
Yeah, plus the money
from the rest of the week.

13:58.970 --> 14:01.439
Who wants to go first?

14:01.440 --> 14:04.041
I will.

14:04.042 --> 14:06.977
Well, uh,
it was randy's idea.

14:06.978 --> 14:08.579
Thanks a lot, brad.
Well, it was.

14:08.580 --> 14:11.114
Cut it out, cut it out.
Sit down on the couch.

14:11.115 --> 14:12.817
Both of you, sit down

14:12.818 --> 14:15.853
And tell me where you come up
with a stupid idea like this.

14:15.854 --> 14:18.021
Well, we were gonna get you
really neat christmas presents.

14:18.022 --> 14:20.558
Don't give me that.
Yeah, I can't live
without rooster man.

14:20.559 --> 14:22.159
The watch is for you, dad.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.061
And the locket's for mom.

14:24.062 --> 14:27.030
Well, no,
that's for jennifer.

14:35.239 --> 14:37.741
You just don't get it,
do you?

14:37.742 --> 14:39.743
That money
was supposed to go

14:39.744 --> 14:41.979
To the oak lane
children's center.

14:41.980 --> 14:44.748
You stole money
out of the hands of kids

14:44.749 --> 14:47.184
Who have next to nothing
for christmas.

14:47.185 --> 14:50.855
We weren't gonna take all of it,
just some of it.

14:50.856 --> 14:53.624
Some of it or all of it,
it was still stealing.

14:53.625 --> 14:55.960
We'll do extra chores
to work off the money.

14:55.961 --> 14:58.796
You're darn right
you'll do extra chores
to work off the money.

14:58.797 --> 15:01.632
Then you're gonna
take this stuff back
and get the money for it.

15:01.633 --> 15:04.468
And then you're gonna
go back to the shelter,
take them the money,

15:04.469 --> 15:06.937
And you're gonna tell them
that you stole it.

15:06.938 --> 15:09.206
But, mom, they're gonna think
we're thieves.

15:09.207 --> 15:11.575
Good, brad.

15:15.780 --> 15:19.249
I think you should
just go up to your room
and think about what you did.

15:19.250 --> 15:22.319
You can just stay up there
for the rest of the night.

15:31.095 --> 15:33.831

15:38.302 --> 15:40.303
Oh, it's gonna be
a lot of fun today.

15:40.304 --> 15:42.640
We're gonna have a lot
of tim taylor holiday hits,

out of this chimney

16:36.160 --> 16:38.629
No, that's the name

Come on.

16:38.630 --> 16:41.131
We have our own names.

No, the manhattan transfer

A backup band today

17:09.928 --> 17:11.929

singing acapulco.

So? I had to give them
the money.

19:57.561 --> 19:59.529
You don't ever play with this,

19:59.530 --> 20:02.132
No, not really.

20:02.133 --> 20:04.968

Hey, great idea.
