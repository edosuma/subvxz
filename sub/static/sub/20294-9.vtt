09:12.767 --> 09:14.167
WHERE YOU COMING FROM?

09:14.267 --> 09:15.567
-(mumbles)

09:15.667 --> 09:16.733
-NO, JUST NOW.

09:16.833 --> 09:18.667
-OH. I PICKED UP MY SON.

09:18.767 --> 09:20.100
-YOU DID?

09:20.200 --> 09:21.500
THAT'S YOUR SON?
-BOTH OF THEM.

09:21.600 --> 09:22.900
-OH, THEY'RE BOTH
YOUR SON.

09:23.067 --> 09:25.067
-IS THERE ANYTHING ILLEGAL
INSIDE ANY OF YOUR STUFF THERE?

09:25.133 --> 09:27.233
THAT'S YOUR BACKPACK
BACK THERE?
-YES, IT IS, SIR.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.767
-RIGHT, HANG TIGHT OVER HERE.

09:28.867 --> 09:31.100
-BASICALLY, WE SAW
THIS VEHICLE COMING OUT
OF AN AREA

09:31.200 --> 09:33.467
KNOWN FOR A HIGH VOLUME
OF NARCOTICS.

09:33.567 --> 09:35.500
AS WE WERE TRAVELING
BEHIND HIM,

09:35.600 --> 09:39.900
HIS REAR SEAT PASSENGER
WAS MAKING ALL SORTS
OF CONCEALING MOVEMENTS.

09:40.067 --> 09:42.933
LIKE HE WAS TRYING TO HIDE
SOMETHING TO HIS LEFT.

09:43.067 --> 09:44.333
-GOOD GIRL!

09:44.433 --> 09:47.067
WHEN SHE SITS, IT'S SHE'S
ALERTED TO THE ODOR
OF NARCOTICS.

09:47.133 --> 09:49.833
CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY
SHE'S ALERTING TO THE ODOR
OF NARCOTICS?

09:49.933 --> 09:51.200
-NO, SIR, I DON'T.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.767
-DO YOU SMOKE MARIJUANA
FROM TIME TO TIME?
-NO, SIR.

09:52.867 --> 09:54.400
-DO YOU KNOW IF ANYBODY DOES
IN YOUR CAR?

09:54.500 --> 09:55.867
DO YOU LEND YOUR CAR?
-NO.

09:55.967 --> 09:59.333
WE'LL, I'VE HAD A COUPLE
OF BUDDIES OF MINE
SOMETIMES ROLL WITH ME

09:59.433 --> 10:01.333
AND I THINK THEY
PROBABLY DO.

10:01.433 --> 10:03.400
-DO YOU THINK?
OR HAVE THEY SMOKED IN THE CAR?

10:03.500 --> 10:04.900
-NO, NO.
-YOU DON'T KNOW?

10:05.000 --> 10:08.067
-NO, BUT I DO GET, LIKE,
A WHIFF OF THEM

10:08.167 --> 10:10.167
SOMETIMES WHEN THEY,
YOU KNOW, DO IT.

10:10.267 --> 10:11.900
-WHEN THEY COME IN YOUR CAR,
THEY REEK OF MARIJUANA?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.167
-SOMETIMES. YEAH.
-OKAY.

10:13.267 --> 10:15.867
-BUT I DON'T ALLOW NOBODY
TO DO THAT IN MY CAR.

10:15.967 --> 10:17.233
-OKAY. UNDERSTOOD.

10:17.333 --> 10:18.733
HOW ABOUT YOU, BROTHER?

10:18.833 --> 10:20.033
NO?

10:20.133 --> 10:21.467
ALL RIGHT.

10:21.567 --> 10:23.167
BECAUSE OF THE DOG ALERT,
WE'RE GOING TO SEARCH
YOUR VEHICLE.

10:23.267 --> 10:25.767
MAKE SURE THERE'S NO DRUGS.
AFTER THAT YOU'LL BE ON
YOUR WAY. ALL RIGHT?

10:25.867 --> 10:28.233
-WITH THE K9 ALERT,
WE'RE SEARCHING THE CAR
RIGHT NOW.

10:28.333 --> 10:29.867
SEE IF WE CAN FIND ANYTHING.

10:29.967 --> 10:31.600
RUSS, YOU GOT ANYTHING
IN HERE?

10:31.700 --> 10:33.000
NO, NOT YET.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.767
WHEN THEY WERE-- WHEN WE
WERE BEHIND THEM--
-I GOT SOMETHING.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.567
-YOU GOT IT?
-YUP. CRACK.

10:36.667 --> 10:39.400
UM, IT'S GONNA BE
A COUPLE ROCKS IN HERE.

10:39.500 --> 10:40.767
-JUST A COUPLE CRACK ROCKS?
-YEAH.

10:40.867 --> 10:42.100
-WE'LL PLAY IT COOL
FOR RIGHT NOW.
-YEAH.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.333
-JUST KEEP ON SEARCHING.

10:43.433 --> 10:46.233
SEE 'EM AT THE BOTTOM?
-YEAH, A COUPLE CRACK ROCKS.

10:46.333 --> 10:49.733
UNDER THERE BENEATH
THE CIGARETTES.

10:49.833 --> 10:52.733
-OKAY, LISTEN. LET'S GO AHEAD
AND JUST CUFF HIM UP.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.000
-SEE IF HE PLAYS FIRST.

10:56.100 --> 10:58.233
-YEAH, LET ME TALK
TO YOU OVER HERE, SIR.

11:02.600 --> 11:04.333
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS YOUR BROTHER,
YOU SAID, RIGHT?

11:04.433 --> 11:06.067
-YES, SIR.
-I'M JUST GONNA BE HONEST
WITH YOU.

11:06.100 --> 11:09.267
AND TELL YOU STRAIGHT UP.
HE HAD SOME CRACK INSIDE
OF A CIGARETTE BOX.

11:09.367 --> 11:10.867
-MAN...
-OKAY?

11:10.967 --> 11:13.067
I THINK YOU KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT HE WAS DOING.

11:13.133 --> 11:16.067
-I MEAN...
-WHAT IS THE FIRST THING
THAT I SAID TO YOU

11:16.133 --> 11:17.867
WHEN I STARTED TALKING
TO YOU WAS

11:17.967 --> 11:20.567
THAT YOUR BACK SEAT PASSENGER
WAS CONCEALING SOMETHING
OR TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.400
IS THAT CORRECT?

11:22.500 --> 11:25.500
-I JUST THOUGHT HE WAS
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THE LUNCH
WASN'T SPILLING OR ANYTHING.

11:25.600 --> 11:28.700
'CAUSE I TOLD HIM
MY GIRL DRIVES THAT CAR

11:28.800 --> 11:31.067
MORE THAN ME. SO,
I TOLD HIM...
-OKAY.

11:31.133 --> 11:32.767
-DON'T LET IT SPILL
OR ANYTHING.

11:32.867 --> 11:37.333
-OKAY, WELL, I MEAN,
WITHOUT ME EVEN TELLING HIM
WHAT I FOUND YET,

11:37.433 --> 11:39.067
HE TOLD ME THAT
THE BACKPACK WAS HIS.

11:39.100 --> 11:41.400
THAT'S WHERE WE HAPPENED
TO FIND THE STUFF AT.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.100
WHERE DID YOU GUYS
JUST GO?

11:43.200 --> 11:46.100
-UH, HE SAID HE WANTED
TO GO TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.567
AND, RIGHT THERE IN THAT--

11:48.667 --> 11:50.833
-LISTEN, MAN, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO SUGARCOAT ANY OF THIS.

11:50.933 --> 11:52.633
YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT HE DID.

11:52.733 --> 11:54.433
RIGHT? YOU TOOK HIM
TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE.

11:54.533 --> 11:55.767
-YEAH.
-HE WENT UP,

11:55.867 --> 11:57.833
YOU ALL STAYED
INSIDE THE VEHICLE.

11:57.933 --> 11:59.767
WHAT DID YOU THINK
HE WAS DOING?

11:59.867 --> 12:01.433
-I REALLY DON'T KNOW, REALLY.

12:01.533 --> 12:04.100
-I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT
WE KNOW WHO'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR THIS.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.067
-YEAH, DEFINITELY.
-YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
I DON'T WANT TO...

12:06.100 --> 12:07.800
I WOULD HATE TO TAKE
YOUR FATHER TO JAIL

12:07.900 --> 12:09.533
BECAUSE THE CRACK COCAINE
BELONGED TO HIM.

12:09.633 --> 12:11.067
WE NEED TO KNOW
WHO IT BELONGS TO.

12:11.100 --> 12:12.400
-NO, IT DON'T BELONG TO ME.
-OKAY.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.233
ALL RIGHT.

12:14.333 --> 12:15.800
WELL, I'M GONNA GO TALK
TO HIM, THEN

12:15.900 --> 12:17.067
AND SEE WHAT HE SAYS, OKAY?
-YEAH.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.533
-ALL RIGHT.

12:18.633 --> 12:20.067
ALL RIGHT, JUAN.

12:20.133 --> 12:21.533
WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU DID.

12:21.633 --> 12:24.200
WE SAW WHAT YOU WERE DOING
WHEN WE FIRST GOT BEHIND YOU.

12:24.300 --> 12:26.200
WAY BEFORE WE EVEN
TURNED OUR LIGHTS ON.

12:26.300 --> 12:28.767
ALL RIGHT, WE SAW YOU HIDING
THE CRACK COCAINE.

12:28.867 --> 12:30.200
IS THAT RIGHT?
-YES.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.800
-WHAT I'D LIKE TO MAKE SURE
IS THAT

12:32.900 --> 12:35.467
YOUR BROTHER AND YOUR FATHER
HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

12:35.567 --> 12:36.767
-THEY DON'T HAVE NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

12:36.867 --> 12:38.567
-SO, FROM START
TO BEGINNING,

12:38.667 --> 12:40.233
CAN YOU GO AHEAD
AND EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT HAPPENED?

12:40.333 --> 12:43.433
-I JUST GOT OFF WORK
AND I DON'T HAVE
A DRIVER'S LICENSE.

12:43.533 --> 12:45.433
-CAN YOU SPEAK UP FOR ME
A LITTLE BIT?
-THEY PICKED ME UP.

12:45.533 --> 12:46.767
-WHERE DID THEY PICK
YOU UP FROM?

12:46.867 --> 12:48.267
-WORK.
-OKAY, AND THEN WHAT?

12:48.367 --> 12:49.700
-THEN I WENT
TO SEE MY FRIEND.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.533
-YOU ASKED YOUR BROTHER
TO DRIVE YOU OVER THERE?
-YEAH.

12:51.633 --> 12:53.133
-DO YOU SMOKE CIGARETTES?
-YES.

12:53.233 --> 12:56.333
-SO, WHEN WE WERE BEHIND YOU,
YOU WERE REACHING OVER
AND PUTTING...

12:56.433 --> 12:58.667
IS THAT WHAT
YOU WERE DOING?
-YEAH.

12:58.767 --> 13:01.067
YOU WERE PUTTING
THE CRACK ROCKS INTO THE 305'S?

13:01.100 --> 13:02.800
INTO THE CARTON?
-YES.

13:02.900 --> 13:05.100
-WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO
IS HAVE YOU HAVE A SEAT
IN THE CAR. ALL RIGHT?

13:05.200 --> 13:06.467
-ALL RIGHT, MAN.
APPRECIATE IT.

13:06.567 --> 13:09.133
IT'S PROBABLY BE A GOOD IDEA
TO APOLOGIZE TO YOUR BROTHER

13:09.233 --> 13:10.933
WHEN HE DOES COME OVER, OKAY?

13:12.133 --> 13:13.300
-JUST HANG TIGHT, ALL RIGHT?

13:13.400 --> 13:14.867
-ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

13:14.967 --> 13:16.633
WE'LL GO AHEAD
AND RELEASE THE CAR BACK TO YOU.

13:16.733 --> 13:17.767
OKAY?
-I APPRECIATE THAT, MAN.

13:17.867 --> 13:19.300
-YEAH, LISTEN,
JUST TAKE OUR ADVICE.

13:19.400 --> 13:21.300
YOU NEED TO KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT'S IN YOUR VEHICLE,

13:21.400 --> 13:23.067
WHO'S IN YOUR VEHICLE,
AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

13:23.100 --> 13:25.833
JUAN'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE
BOOKED INTO THE LEE COUNTY JAIL.

13:25.933 --> 13:27.833
HE'LL BE CHARGED WITH
POSSESSION OF COCAINE. OKAY?

13:27.933 --> 13:29.067
-YES, SIR.

13:31.100 --> 13:34.367
-WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, I KINDA
GREW UP LIKE MOST OF THESE
KIDS AROUND HERE.

13:34.467 --> 13:35.867
LIFE WASN'T SO EASY.

13:35.967 --> 13:38.733
SO, WHEN I DEAL WITH THOSE
TYPE OF KIDS,

13:38.833 --> 13:40.467
I CAN RELATE TO THEM.

13:40.567 --> 13:42.633
I CAN GIVE THEM EXAMPLES
FROM WHEN I GREW UP.

13:42.733 --> 13:44.167
TRY TO STEER THEM
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

13:44.267 --> 13:46.533
SO, THEY KINDA FEEL
MORE COMFORTABLE TALKING TO ME

13:46.633 --> 13:48.233
AND TAKING MY ADVICE.

13:48.333 --> 13:50.700
(radio chatter)

13:50.800 --> 13:54.733
WE'RE GOING TO A DISTURBANCE.
VERBAL, POSSIBLY PHYSICAL.

13:54.833 --> 13:57.867
IT'S A FATHER AND SON.

13:57.967 --> 14:00.667
FATHER'S SUPPOSEDLY DRUNK,
THROWING ITEMS AROUND
THE HOUSE.

14:00.767 --> 14:03.167
SO, WE'RE GONNA GO OUT
AND TALK TO THEM.

14:03.267 --> 14:05.067
SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

14:07.733 --> 14:09.967
-OH, I'VE BEEN OUT WITH HIM
A FEW TIMES.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.467
WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?

14:14.567 --> 14:15.933
WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:16.067 --> 14:18.900
-NOTHIN'. HE THREW
A BOTTLE AT ME. I WAS--

14:19.067 --> 14:22.433
FIRST, HE GOT IN MY FACE
AND STARTED PUNCHING ME
IN MY RIBS,

14:22.533 --> 14:25.167
SAYING, "YOU GONNA DO THE DISHES
OR I'M GONNA VIOLATE YOU."

14:25.267 --> 14:26.867
AND THEN I STARTED
CUSSING AT HIM.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.800
TELLING HIM TO GET OUT
OF MY ROOM, GET OUT OF MY FACE.

14:28.900 --> 14:30.167
'CAUSE I'M NOT STARTING
WITH HIM.

14:30.267 --> 14:32.067
THEN HE THREW
A FREAKING BOTTLE AT ME.

14:32.100 --> 14:34.433
SO, I THREW IT BACK AT HIM,
BUT I DID NOT HIT HIM.
-OKAY.

14:34.533 --> 14:37.433
-AND THAT'S WHEN I WENT
OUTSIDE 'CAUSE I WAS GONNA
HIT HIM.

14:37.533 --> 14:39.067
BUT I DIDN'T WANT
TO GET CUT.

14:39.167 --> 14:40.767
-YOU'RE WHAT, 15?

14:40.867 --> 14:43.067
-17.
-17, YEAH.

14:43.100 --> 14:44.300
IT'S GOOD THAT
YOU WALKED AWAY.

14:44.400 --> 14:45.933
-HE HIT ME
IN MY FREAKING HEAD.

14:46.067 --> 14:47.567
-LET ME SEE.

14:48.800 --> 14:52.333
-I WAS TRYING-- I WAS GONNA
TELL A FRIEND TO BRING ME
TO THE HOSPITAL

14:52.433 --> 14:54.800
THIS MORNING 'CAUSE
MY CHEST WAS HURTING.

14:54.900 --> 14:57.533
I'M STILL IN PAIN,
BUT HE DOESN'T GIVE A (bleep).

14:57.633 --> 14:59.900
-ALL RIGHT, YOU JUST STAY
OVER HERE, OKAY?

15:00.067 --> 15:01.833
(knocking)
-WHO IS IT?

15:01.933 --> 15:03.200
-SHERIFF'S OFFICE.
-WHO?

15:03.300 --> 15:05.267
-SHERIFF'S OFFICE.
-OH.

15:06.767 --> 15:07.833
-HOW YOU DOING, MAN?

15:07.933 --> 15:09.067
-GOOD, MAN, YOU WANT
ME TO DISARM?

15:09.167 --> 15:10.667
-YES, PLEASE. PRETTY PLEASE.

15:10.767 --> 15:12.433
-WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO DO THAT? IN MY TRUNK?

15:12.533 --> 15:15.233
-YOU CAN JUST THROW IT
RIGHT INSIDE THE DOOR.
THAT'S FINE.

15:19.067 --> 15:20.867
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT NOTHING
ELSE ON YOU, RIGHT?
-NAH.

15:20.967 --> 15:22.867
-ALL RIGHT, JUST LIFT
YOUR SHIRT UP AND SPIN AROUND.

15:25.567 --> 15:26.600
JUST WANNA DOUBLE CHECK.

15:26.700 --> 15:28.067
-NOT A PROBLEM.
-THAT WAY I'M NOT NERVOUS.

15:28.133 --> 15:29.067
-YOU DON'T NEED TO BE.

15:29.167 --> 15:30.500
THERE'S A MAG THERE,

15:30.600 --> 15:33.433
MY PHONE, I'VE GOT MY VAPE.

15:33.533 --> 15:35.100
-ALL RIGHT.
-WE'RE ALL GOOD.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.533
-WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?

15:36.633 --> 15:40.533
MY SON IS ON PROBATION.

15:40.633 --> 15:42.100
AS OF TUESDAY.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.400
HE'S VIOLATED
EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.

15:44.500 --> 15:49.600
DOCTOR, UM...
JUDGE THOMPSON IS THE JUDGE.

15:49.700 --> 15:52.633
HE SLEEPS ALL DAY.
I HAD TO WORK TODAY, OKAY?

15:52.733 --> 15:57.167
I ASKED HIM TO CALMLY
PLEASE, DO SOME HOUSE CHORES.

15:57.267 --> 15:59.733
GET THE DISHES DONE
SO I CAN MAKE DINNER.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.400
-OKAY.
-HE REFUSED TO DO IT.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.667
GOT THE DISHES THAT WERE
IN THE SINK,

16:03.767 --> 16:05.967
JUST THREW THEM.
GOT MY GLASSES, THREW THEM.

16:06.067 --> 16:07.500
GOT ANOTHER BOTTLE,

16:07.600 --> 16:09.067
THREW IT AGAINST
THE WINDOW.

16:09.100 --> 16:10.833
-DID YOU PICK ALL THAT UP?
-NO, IT'S STILL THERE.

16:10.933 --> 16:12.533
IT'S ALL STILL THERE.

16:12.633 --> 16:14.667
-UM, DID YOU THROW
A BOTTLE AT HIM?

16:14.767 --> 16:18.367
-I DIDN'T THROW A BOTTLE.
I HAD A BOTTLE AND I SQUIRTED
THE WATER ON HIM.

16:18.467 --> 16:20.833
LIKE MY MOM USED TO DO
TO ME TO GET YOUR BUTT
OUT OF BED

16:20.933 --> 16:22.633
WHEN IT'S TIME
TO GET TO SCHOOL.

16:22.733 --> 16:25.067
-I KNOW YOU'VE HAD PROBLEMS
WITH HIM FOR YEARS NOW.

16:25.167 --> 16:26.433
-YEAH, AND I NEVER--

16:26.533 --> 16:27.700
-WHAT IS HE ON PROBATION FOR?

16:27.800 --> 16:28.833
-DOMESTIC VIOLENCE.

16:28.933 --> 16:30.133
-AGAINST YOU? OKAY.
-AGAINST ME.

16:30.233 --> 16:31.833
-ALL RIGHT.

16:31.933 --> 16:35.067
HOW ARE WE GONNA
SOLVE THIS TONIGHT?

16:35.167 --> 16:36.967
-LET'S VIOLATE HIM.

16:37.067 --> 16:38.233
-FOR WHAT?

16:38.333 --> 16:39.500
-HE'S OUTSIDE.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.300
-WELL, HE'S OUTSIDE 'CAUSE
HE FELT HE WAS IN DANGER.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.233
I CAN'T VIOLATE SOMEONE
FOR THAT.

16:43.333 --> 16:45.267
-WELL, I FEEL LIKE I'M
IN DANGER, TOO.

16:45.367 --> 16:46.800
PUTTING HIM ON PROBATION--
-WELL, EVERY TIME--

16:46.900 --> 16:48.333
EVERY TIME HE'S NOT HERE,

16:48.433 --> 16:50.467
EVERY TIME HE LEAVES
THE HOUSE, CALL US.

16:50.567 --> 16:52.767
CALL US. WE'LL COME OUT HERE
AND WE'LL DO A CHECK ON HIM.

16:52.867 --> 16:55.167
IF HE'S NOT HERE,
WE'LL VIOLATE HIM.
AND WE'LL TAKE HIM TO JAIL.

16:55.267 --> 16:56.533
RIGHT.
-YOU'RE GOOD.

16:56.633 --> 16:57.933
-ALL RIGHT.

16:58.067 --> 16:59.467
-HE WASN'T HITTING ME HARD.

16:59.567 --> 17:01.500
-WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT
IF YOU'RE SITTING IN BED
ALL DAY

17:01.600 --> 17:03.367
AND YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
DOING CHORES AROUND THE HOUSE.

17:03.467 --> 17:05.333
-I WASN'T FEELING GOOD.
AND I'M STILL NOT FEELING GOOD.

17:05.433 --> 17:08.367
-EVEN STILL.
IF YOU'RE SITTING
IN BED ALL DAY,

17:08.467 --> 17:09.667
AND YOU'RE TOLD
TO DO SOMETHING,

17:09.767 --> 17:11.733
AND YOU DON'T DO IT,
AND HE REACTS THE WAY HE DOES,

17:11.833 --> 17:13.200
THROWING WATER AT YOU
AND STUFF LIKE THAT--

17:13.300 --> 17:14.267
-HE DIDN'T THROW WATER
AT ME.

17:14.367 --> 17:15.933
HE THREW A BOTTLE
OF WATER AT ME.

17:16.067 --> 17:17.200
HE DID NOT SQUIRT ME.

17:17.300 --> 17:19.100
-YOU DO WHAT HE SAYS,
HE'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.067
IT'S THAT SIMPLE, ALL RIGHT?

17:21.133 --> 17:22.867
EVERY TIME YOU'RE OUT
OF THIS HOUSE, HE'S GONNA
CALL US,

17:22.967 --> 17:24.367
AND WE'RE GOING
TO VIOLATE YOU.

17:24.467 --> 17:26.067
I'VE BEEN OUT WITH YOU
PLENTY OF TIMES, SO I KNOW
HOW YOU ACT.

17:26.133 --> 17:27.433
ALL RIGHT, GO INSIDE.

17:29.833 --> 17:31.467
-YOU DEALT WITH THEM BEFORE?

17:31.567 --> 17:33.567
-YEAH, I'VE BEEN DEALING
WITH THEM THE LAST
THREE OR FOUR YEARS.

17:33.667 --> 17:36.833
-OKAY. YEAH, IT DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE THE DAD AND THE SON
ARE GETTING ALONG TOO WELL.

17:36.933 --> 17:39.167
-NAH, THEY'RE GOING THROUGH
A LOT OF PROBLEMS.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.233
-OKAY.
-AND DAD'S COMING UP.

17:41.333 --> 17:44.400
-WHY IS HE AT MY NEIGHBOR'S
HOUSE AND TALKING
TO HIS FRIENDS

17:44.500 --> 17:46.633
IF HE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE IN THE HOUSE?

17:46.733 --> 17:48.333
-IS THAT WHERE HE'S AT?
-YEAH.

17:48.433 --> 17:50.567
-OKAY. WELL, WE'LL TAKE
HIM TO JAIL.

17:50.667 --> 17:52.500
I TOLD HIM TO GO INSIDE.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.367
-I'M ARMED, THAT'S WHY
I'M DOING THIS.
-OKAY.

17:54.467 --> 17:55.867
JUST WALK IN FRONT
OF US.

17:57.233 --> 17:59.067
-OH. JUST WALKED
FROM HIS NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE.

17:59.133 --> 18:00.233
'CAUSE I'M TRYING
TO CALM DOWN.

18:00.333 --> 18:02.067
IF I GO BACK IN THERE,
I'M GONNA GET UPSET.

18:02.133 --> 18:03.833
AND I DON'T' WANT TO FIGHT
WITH YOU, DAD.
-TURN AROUND.

18:03.933 --> 18:05.133
TURN AROUND.

18:05.233 --> 18:07.067
I TOLD YOU-- TURN AROUND.
-I'M GOING INSIDE.

18:07.167 --> 18:09.167
-DON'T TIGHTEN UP.
TURN AROUND.

18:09.267 --> 18:11.300
I TOLD YOU TO GO INSIDE.
-I AM!

18:11.400 --> 18:13.133
-DON'T TIGHTEN UP.

18:13.233 --> 18:16.167
-IF I WENT BACK INSIDE
I WAS GONNA START FIGHTING.

18:16.267 --> 18:18.467
THAT WAS MY PLAN.
I WAS TRYING TO CALM DOWN.

18:18.567 --> 18:20.800
-YOU CALM DOWN INSIDE.
NOT OUTSIDE.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.267
DO YOU WANT SHOES?

18:22.367 --> 18:24.533
-WHY AM I GOING?
-YOU'RE ON PROBATION, RIGHT?

18:24.633 --> 18:26.367
-YEAH, THAT'S WHY
I LEFT OUT.

18:26.467 --> 18:28.567
-YOU GOT A CURFEW, RIGHT?
-ON MY PROBATION,

18:28.667 --> 18:30.967
IT SAYS NO PHYSICAL
CONTACT WITH HIM.

18:31.067 --> 18:33.467
AND IF I WENT BACK IN,
I WAS GONNA GET PHYSICAL,

18:33.567 --> 18:35.633
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO GET PHYSICAL.

18:35.733 --> 18:39.067
-OKAY. YOU HAD TO BE
INSIDE THAT HOUSE
AT 6:00 AT NIGHT.

18:39.133 --> 18:42.733
OKAY, I UNDERSTAND THE REASON
WHY YOU WERE OUTSIDE
THE FIRST TIME,

18:42.833 --> 18:44.733
BUT AFTER WE CAME
AND SETTLED THE SITUATION,

18:44.833 --> 18:46.367
I TOLD YOU TO GO INSIDE.
-I WAS STILL HEATED.

18:46.467 --> 18:47.900
-OKAY.
-AND I WAS TRYING--

18:48.067 --> 18:51.567
-YOU CAN'T KEEP YOUR MOUTH
SHUT WHILE YOU GO INSIDE?

18:51.667 --> 18:53.533
YOU WANNA ACT
LIKE A GROWN-UP,

18:53.633 --> 18:54.700
THAT'S WHAT GROWN-UPS DO.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.267
-HE WAS GONNA--
-THEY BITE THEIR TONGUE

18:56.367 --> 18:58.167
SO NOTHING HAPPENS. OKAY?

18:58.267 --> 19:00.233
SIMPLE AS THAT.
THAT'S ALL YOU HAD TO DO.

19:05.633 --> 19:07.067
-SO, I AM GOING TO JAIL?

19:07.167 --> 19:10.367
-THE MISTAKE THAT
YOU MADE WAS WALKING
TO YOUR FRIEND'S HOUSE.

19:10.467 --> 19:12.133
OKAY, YOU MADE THAT DECISION.

19:12.233 --> 19:14.233
-I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO GO BACK INSIDE

19:14.333 --> 19:15.533
'CAUSE OF HIM.
-WE DON'T--

19:15.633 --> 19:17.833
YOU DON'T HAVE A CHOICE
UNTIL YOU'RE 18.

19:17.933 --> 19:19.567
YOU DO NOT HAVE A CHOICE.

19:19.667 --> 19:23.867
NOW YOU'RE... YOU WANNA BE
AN ADULT, BUT YOU'RE MAKING
CHILDISH DECISIONS.

19:23.967 --> 19:26.367
OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA BE 18 SOON.
YOU'RE GONNA BE OUT ON YOUR OWN.

19:26.467 --> 19:28.433
ALL RIGHT? YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO MAKE ADULT DECISIONS.

19:28.533 --> 19:30.700
AND THIS IS WHEN
IT STARTS. NOW. OKAY?

19:30.800 --> 19:33.733
YEAH, HE'S A LITTLE
TOUGH TO DEAL WITH,

19:33.833 --> 19:35.367
BUT IF YOU JUST
LISTEN TO HIM,

19:35.467 --> 19:36.667
ALL YOU GOT IS 10 MORE MONTHS.

19:36.767 --> 19:38.333
LISTEN TO HIM,

19:38.433 --> 19:41.300
DO WHAT HE SAYS,
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT,

19:41.400 --> 19:43.200
AND IT'LL BE
A SMOOTH 10 MONTHS.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.300
AND THEN, YOU CAN LEAVE. RIGHT?

19:45.400 --> 19:47.533
WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOU
DOWN TO JUVENILE CENTER.

19:48.933 --> 19:49.967
-Officer over radio:
132 AND BUSH.

19:50.067 --> 19:51.633
I'VE GOT HIM AT GUNPOINT.

19:51.733 --> 19:53.400
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, GUNPOINT, 132 AND BUSH.

19:53.500 --> 19:54.433
COVER IS CODE THREE.

19:54.533 --> 19:57.500
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:02.933 --> 20:04.867
-Dispatcher:
OKAY, STILL SEND A CODE THREE.

20:04.967 --> 20:05.967
-(theme music playing)
