WEBVTT

00:01.333 --> 00:02.267
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...
THIS IS THE BEST BREAKUP EVER.

00:02.300 --> 00:03.567
SHE'S DOING McDREAMY.
NORMAN IS AN INTERN.

00:03.600 --> 00:08.533
I'M YOUR SISTER.
YOU'RE NOT A GIRL I EVER
WANTED TO HAVE TO KNOW

00:08.567 --> 00:11.200
BECAUSE OUR DAD CHOSE YOU.
MY NIECE'S
CANCER'S COME BACK.

00:11.233 --> 00:13.767
SHE'S 17 YEARS OLD
AND SHE'S GONNA DIE.

00:15.600 --> 00:18.467
ALEX, I'M SORRY. I CAN'T.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.800
I SLEPT WITH IZZIE.

00:22.400 --> 00:24.067
***

00:24.100 --> 00:26.400
(Meredith) IN LIFE,
ONLY ONE THING IS CERTAIN--

00:26.433 --> 00:28.767
APART FROM DEATH AND TAXES--

00:28.800 --> 00:30.700
NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY,

00:30.733 --> 00:32.733
NO MATTER HOW GOOD
YOUR INTENTIONS,

00:34.833 --> 00:36.567
(George) CALLIE.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.500
YOU'RE GOING TO HURT PEOPLE.

00:38.533 --> 00:40.433
YOU'RE GOING TO GET HURT.

00:40.467 --> 00:42.367
AND IF YOU EVER WANT
TO RECOVER...

00:42.400 --> 00:44.600
YOU HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING
IN...

00:44.633 --> 00:46.533
IN...

00:46.567 --> 00:50.733
***

00:50.767 --> 00:53.067
JUST SAY SOMETHING.

00:54.233 --> 00:55.767
PLEASE.

00:55.800 --> 00:57.533
ANYTHING.

00:57.567 --> 01:02.100
THERE'S REALLY ONLY ONE THING
YOU CAN SAY.

01:02.133 --> 01:04.067
I FORGIVE YOU.

01:04.100 --> 01:06.800
WHAT?

01:06.833 --> 01:10.167
YOU MADE A MISTAKE.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.067
***

01:13.100 --> 01:15.233
BUT WE TOOK VOWS--

01:15.267 --> 01:16.733
TILL DEATH DO US PART--

01:16.767 --> 01:18.300
SO...

01:18.333 --> 01:20.733
I FORGIVE YOU.

01:20.767 --> 01:23.767
***

01:25.167 --> 01:27.333
IZZIE, WHY AREN'T YOU
PICKING UP YOUR PHONE?

01:27.367 --> 01:29.400
YOU NEED TO PICK UP
YOUR PHONE.

01:29.433 --> 01:31.333
I JUST TALKED TO CALLIE AND...
(Meredith) GEORGE.

01:31.367 --> 01:34.267
I GOTTA FIND IZZIE.
WE HAVE ROUNDS
IN FIVE MINUTES.

01:34.300 --> 01:36.200
RIGHT AFTER I FIND IZZIE.

01:36.233 --> 01:37.833
***

01:37.867 --> 01:40.233
YOU WANNA GO AWAY WITH ME
THIS WEEKEND?
WHY WOULD I WANT
TO GO AWAY WITH YOU?

01:40.267 --> 01:42.267
BECAUSE OF THIS.

01:42.300 --> 01:44.200
WE DIDN'T GO AWAY
WHEN WE WERE A COUPLE.

01:44.233 --> 01:45.733
NOW WE'RE NOT A COUPLE,

01:45.767 --> 01:48.033
AND NOT COUPLES HAVE NO REASON
TO GO AWAY TOGETHER.

01:48.067 --> 01:49.567
MEREDITH, YOU'RE NOT
PAYING ATTENTION.

01:49.600 --> 01:52.233
I'M TALKING ABOUT 48
UNINTERRUPTED HOURS OF THIS.

01:52.267 --> 01:54.167
***

01:54.200 --> 01:56.167
WHERE WOULD WE GO?
WINE COUNTRY.

01:56.200 --> 01:58.467
WINE COUNTRY SOUNDS LIKE
A COUPLES' PLACE.

01:58.500 --> 02:00.133
WELL, THERE'S WINE,
THERE'S COUNTRY,

02:00.167 --> 02:01.467
AND YOU WOULDN'T SEE
ANY OF IT.

02:01.500 --> 02:04.067
WE'D BE IN BED ALL WEEKEND.
OH, A WEEKEND OF SEX.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.333
AH! NOW YOU'RE
PAYING ATTENTION.
(elevator bell dings)

02:06.367 --> 02:09.833
WELL, I WOULD HAVE TO GET
SOMEONE TO COVER FOR ME.

02:09.867 --> 02:11.500
OKAY, SO YOU'RE IN?

02:11.533 --> 02:13.767
48 UNINTERRUPTED HOURS
OF THIS.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.467
I'M IN.

02:15.500 --> 02:17.333
***

02:17.367 --> 02:18.567
OH, GREAT.

02:18.600 --> 02:20.500
I'M STUCK IN THE PIT
PROTECTING SMACKHEADS

02:20.533 --> 02:22.567
AND GANGBANGERS
WITH MY IDIOT INTERNS,

02:22.600 --> 02:26.167
AND YOU'RE GETTING McDREAMIED
IN THE ELEVATOR?
REALLY, SMACKHEADS
AND GANGBANGERS

02:26.200 --> 02:27.700
AT SEATTLE GRACE, HUH?

02:27.733 --> 02:29.200
MY POINT IS,
I HATE INTERNS.

02:29.233 --> 02:31.100
WELL, LEXIE'S NOT THAT BAD,
IS SHE?

02:31.133 --> 02:32.800
OH, ARE WE
NOT HATING HER ANYMORE?

02:32.833 --> 02:34.733
OH, NO. WE STILL HATE
THE IDEA OF HER.

02:34.767 --> 02:36.800
WE JUST REALIZED
WE DON'T HAVE A REASON

02:36.833 --> 02:39.567
TO HATE THE ACTUAL PERSON.
SHE'S AN INTERN.
THAT'S REASON ENOUGH.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.600
OH. I THINK YOU MAY BE
THE NEW NAZI.
DAMN RIGHT.

02:42.633 --> 02:45.233
I DON'T SEE ANY CHARTS.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.767
WILL YOU WORK FOR ME
ON SATURDAY?

02:49.800 --> 02:52.133
WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

02:52.167 --> 02:54.367
TAKE NORMAN
OFF MY HANDS TODAY.
WHO?

02:54.400 --> 02:56.833
THE WORLD'S OLDEST INTERN. I'VE
GOT MY INTERNS IN THE PIT,

02:56.867 --> 02:59.067
AND HE'S ONLY GONNA
SLOW ME DOWN.
AGEIST.

02:59.100 --> 03:01.033
DEAL?
FINE.

03:02.533 --> 03:04.467
ROUNDS.
STILL CAN'T FIND IZZIE.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.533
I'M GONNA HAVE TO PUT YOU IN
THE CLINIC IF YOU MISS ROUNDS.

03:06.567 --> 03:09.267
OH, THE CLINIC!

03:09.300 --> 03:11.633
UH, MS. SAYLES, HI.
I'M DR. BAILEY.

03:11.667 --> 03:13.167
OH, YOU ARE?

03:13.200 --> 03:16.033
UH, THE BOYFRIEND WHO
WARNED HER NOT TO READ

03:16.067 --> 03:17.233
ON THE StairMaster.

03:17.267 --> 03:20.133
THAT'S HOW I DID THIS.
I FELL OFF LAST NIGHT.

03:20.167 --> 03:23.567
I TOOK A TON OF IBUPROFEN,
BUT WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING,

03:23.600 --> 03:26.500
IT WAS HUGE AND HIDEOUS.
HOW MUCH IBUPROFEN
DID YOU TAKE?

03:26.533 --> 03:28.267
I USUALLY TAKE SOME
EVERY DAY ANYWAY,

03:28.300 --> 03:30.467
BECAUSE OF THE GYM,
SO I DOUBLED THE DOSE,

03:30.500 --> 03:33.133
BUT IT DID NOTHING FOR ME.
OKAY, LET'S GET SOME X-RAYS
AND THEN--

03:33.167 --> 03:35.567
ACTUALLY, CAN I JUST GET A SHOT
OF CORTISONE OR SOMETHING?

03:35.600 --> 03:38.100
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET
MY TRAINER AT NOON.

03:38.133 --> 03:40.033
UH, MS. SAYLES,
I CAN'T TREAT YOU

03:40.067 --> 03:42.767
UNTIL I FIND OUT
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU.

03:43.733 --> 03:46.533
HAVE YOU SEEN DR. STEVENS?
CHECK THE PIT.

03:46.567 --> 03:48.467
RIGHT.

03:48.500 --> 03:51.100
WHAT TIME DO YOU THINK
WE'LL BE DONE?

03:51.133 --> 03:53.633
JUST SO I CAN TELL
MY TRAINER.

03:53.667 --> 03:56.300
(siren wailing)

03:56.333 --> 04:00.067
LEXIE! SORRY. UH, HAVE YOU
SEEN DR. STEVENS?
NO. HAVE YOU SEEN DR. YANG?

04:00.100 --> 04:02.467
NO.
SHE TOLD ME TO MEET HER HERE
IN THE PIT, AND SHE'S NOT HERE.

04:02.500 --> 04:05.300
I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THAT WOMAN
ANY MORE REASONS TO HATE ME.
GOOD FOR YOU.

04:05.333 --> 04:07.767
I'M PREPARED. I'M GONNA ANSWER
EVERY QUESTION CORRECTLY.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.600
AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE
ANY MORE OF HER CRAP.
THREE! INCOMING, LET'S MOVE.

04:10.633 --> 04:13.367
HE GOT HIT
DURING A SCRIMMAGE.
ARE YOU THE COACH?

04:13.400 --> 04:14.400
HE'S MY DAD.
AND HIS COACH.

04:14.433 --> 04:16.500
HE WAS CHARGING THE RECEIVER
AFTER THE KICKOFF.

04:16.533 --> 04:18.733
HE GOT BLOCKED,
HAD HIS HEAD DOWN,

04:18.767 --> 04:21.367
COULDN'T SEE
THE OTHER GUY COMING.
I HAD MY HEAD DOWN

04:21.400 --> 04:23.333
BECAUSE THE GUY BLOCKING ME
WAS HOLDING IT DOWN.
YOU COULD'VE GOTTEN PAST
THAT GUY.

04:23.367 --> 04:25.033
I NEED YOU TO LEAVE THE ROOM.

04:25.067 --> 04:26.800
OKAY, LET'S CUT HIM OUT
OF HIS EQUIPMENT.
I NEED THE SAW.

04:26.833 --> 04:29.233
DR. GREY, I NEED YOU TO
HELP ME STABILIZE HIS NECK

04:29.267 --> 04:30.833
AND HIS HEAD, PLEASE.

04:30.867 --> 04:33.733
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT, ADAM,
THAT YOU NOT MOVE YOUR HEAD.

04:33.767 --> 04:35.667
I NEED YOU TO KEEP
PERFECTLY STILL.

04:35.700 --> 04:37.133
DON'T MOVE. RELAX.

04:40.667 --> 04:42.433
O'MALLEY, WHAT'S THE HURRY?

04:42.467 --> 04:44.467
SORRY, I CAN'T TALK, CHIEF.

04:46.467 --> 04:48.067
O'MALLEY?

04:48.100 --> 04:49.267
I...

04:51.767 --> 04:53.100
SORRY, I...

04:53.133 --> 04:54.733
I JUST GOTTA FIND IZZIE.

04:54.767 --> 04:56.767
SHE'S AT THE THIRD FLOOR
NURSES' STATION.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.633
OH. THANKS.

04:58.667 --> 05:00.567
OH, AND--
AND WHEN YOU FIND HER,

05:00.600 --> 05:02.467
TELL HER DR. TORRES
IS LOOKING OR HER.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.367
(elevator bell dings)

05:07.633 --> 05:09.633
NOW I KNOW CHARTING
DOESN'T SEEM

05:09.667 --> 05:11.300
AS EXCITING AS SURGERY,

05:11.333 --> 05:13.100
BUT IT IS EVERY BIT
AS IMPORTANT.

05:13.133 --> 05:15.033
BELIEVE ME
WHEN I TELL YOU, PEOPLE,

05:15.067 --> 05:16.367
PENMANSHIP SAVES LIVES.

05:16.400 --> 05:17.767
PICK UP YOUR PHONE.

05:17.800 --> 05:19.567
WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR
DOESN'T PICK UP THEIR PHONE?

05:19.600 --> 05:21.267
IS THAT A 7 OR IS THAT A 9?

05:21.300 --> 05:23.633
IF I HAVE TO ASK MYSELF
THAT QUESTION

05:23.667 --> 05:26.333
IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EMERGENCY,
YOUR PATIENT IS DEAD.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.467
YOU KILLED HIM
WITH YOUR HANDWRITING.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.333
THINK ABOUT THAT.

05:30.367 --> 05:31.667
CALLIE.

05:31.700 --> 05:34.200
HEY. HI.

05:34.233 --> 05:35.600
WE HAVE TO TALK.

05:35.633 --> 05:38.100
OKAY. UM, ABOUT?

05:38.133 --> 05:40.167
GEORGE TOLD ME.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.700
HE TOLD YOU?

05:41.733 --> 05:43.600
EVERYTHING.

05:43.633 --> 05:47.400
CAFETERIA, NOON,
YOU AND ME.

05:47.433 --> 05:49.700
BE THERE.

05:52.067 --> 05:55.300
DUDE, IS SHE GONNA
KICK HER ASS?

06:04.300 --> 06:05.433
SHE FORGAVE YOU?

06:05.467 --> 06:07.667
SHE SAID I HAD A ROUGH YEAR,
THAT PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES,

06:07.700 --> 06:10.600
AND THAT...
THAT I MADE A MISTAKE.

06:10.633 --> 06:12.833
OH, SO NOW I'M A MISTAKE?
(clears throat)

06:12.867 --> 06:14.767
BACK OFF!
NO, SHE SAID THAT.
I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.067
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

06:17.100 --> 06:18.833
UM, I DIDN'T EXPECT HER
TO FORGIVE ME.

06:18.867 --> 06:21.533
I EXPECTED... RAGE,
UH, BLOODSHED.

06:21.567 --> 06:24.067
NO, SHE'S SAVING ALL HER
RAGE AND BLOODSHED FOR ME.

06:24.100 --> 06:26.033
SHE'S GONNA KILL ME
IN THE CAFETERIA AT LUNCH.

06:26.067 --> 06:28.333
NO, SHE WOULDN'T.
SHE BREAKS BONES FOR
A LIVING, GEORGE. SHE'S CRAZY.

06:28.367 --> 06:29.533
NO, SHE'S NOT CRAZY.

06:29.567 --> 06:33.600
WELL, SHE IS IF SHE THINKS
I'M NOT GONNA PUT UP A FIGHT.

06:33.633 --> 06:35.533
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT KID'S DAD.

06:35.567 --> 06:38.100
I MEAN, HIS SON IS PARALYZED,
AND THE GUY'S STILL RIDING HIM.

06:38.133 --> 06:40.033
FOCUS MORE
ON THE MEDICINE, THREE,

06:40.067 --> 06:41.533
AND LESS ON THE TRAGEDY.
THREE?

06:41.567 --> 06:44.033
IS THAT A NICKNAME?
YOU COULD SAY THAT.

06:44.067 --> 06:47.400
SO HOW WOULD YOU PROCEED,
DR. GREY?

06:47.433 --> 06:49.533
OH, UM...
YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO OPERATE

06:49.567 --> 06:52.333
UNLESS YOU REALIGN
HIS SPINE, WOULD YOU?

06:52.367 --> 06:55.633
MM-HMM. AND HOW WOULD
YOU DO THAT?
TRACTION HALO?

06:55.667 --> 06:57.200
VERY IMPRESSIVE, DR. GREY.

06:57.233 --> 06:59.733
YOUR INTERN YEAR'S OFF
TO A GOOD START.
MM.

06:59.767 --> 07:02.300
HOW'S IT GOING?
HOW ARE YOU AND MEREDITH?

07:02.333 --> 07:03.800
IT'S WEIRD,
THE WHOLE FAMILY THING.

07:03.833 --> 07:06.667
AND PLUS, I THINK SHE MIGHT
STILL HATE ME.

07:06.700 --> 07:07.933
SHE DOESN'T HATE YOU.

07:07.967 --> 07:10.133
REALLY? DID SHE SAY THAT?
YOU KNOW,
WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE

07:10.167 --> 07:12.500
IF MRS. COOLEY'S DRESSINGS
NEED CHANGING?
YANG, WHY DON'T YOU GO SEE

07:12.533 --> 07:15.633
IF MRS. COOLEY'S DRESSING
NEEDS CHANGING?

07:15.667 --> 07:17.233
CERTAINLY.

07:17.267 --> 07:20.200
***

07:20.233 --> 07:22.167
DR. SLOAN,
DR. NORMAN SHALES.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.100
OH, DR. SHALES, CALL ME MARK.
THANK YOU.

07:24.133 --> 07:26.033
I THOUGHT YOU WERE ON
MY SERVICE.

07:26.067 --> 07:27.767
I AM. HE'S MY INTERN.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.533
I KNOW, RIGHT? IT'S LIKE,
"SERIOUSLY, YOU'RE AN INTERN?"

07:30.567 --> 07:33.567
BUT IT'S SERIOUSLY TRUE.
SERIOUSLY. (laughs)

07:33.600 --> 07:35.833
GLAD TO HAVE YOU ABOARD,
NORMAN.

07:35.867 --> 07:38.767
SO IS HE THE ONE
YOU CALL, UH...

07:38.800 --> 07:41.200
McDREAMY OR, Mc, UH,
SLEAZY, OR Mc, UH,

07:41.233 --> 07:43.133
WAIT A MINUTE,
WHAT IS IT?

07:43.167 --> 07:45.067
NORMAN, WE HAVE LABS
TO DELIVER.
YEAH.

07:45.100 --> 07:46.567
LABS AND DISCHARGES.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.500
UH, THIS ONE'S BEING
DISCHARGED TO HOSPICE?

07:48.533 --> 07:50.433
WHEN THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
WE CAN DO.

07:50.467 --> 07:52.367
SO WE HAVE TO TELL SOMEONE
THEY'RE DYING?

07:52.400 --> 07:54.300
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL TEACH YOU THE PROTOCOL.

07:54.333 --> 07:57.233
McSTEAMY! HE'S THE ONE
YOU GIRLS CALL McSTEAMY.

07:57.267 --> 07:58.467
(laughs)

07:58.500 --> 07:59.833
YOU PAGED ME, DR. BAILEY?

07:59.867 --> 08:01.767
OH, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE--

08:01.800 --> 08:03.800
I'M IN THE CLINIC.
OR I WAS--

08:03.833 --> 08:06.567
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
(Miranda) RUTHIE SAYLES.

08:06.600 --> 08:10.267
SAYS SHE TWISTED HER ANKLE
FALLING OFF THE StairMaster.
SHE DIDN'T TWIST IT.

08:10.300 --> 08:13.100
SHE CRUSHED IT. WE SHOULD
BOOK AN O.R. RIGHT AWAY.

08:13.133 --> 08:15.033
DR. TORRES, YOU DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD RUN A FEW TESTS FIRST?

08:15.067 --> 08:17.833
FIND OUT WHY RUTHIE'S BONES ARE
SO FRAGILE IN THE FIRST PLACE?

08:17.867 --> 08:20.533
SHE'S OSTEOPOROTIC. I SEE IT
IN OLDER WOMEN ALL THE TIME.

08:20.567 --> 08:23.400
NOW YOU'RE SEEING IT
IN A 28 YEAR OLD.

08:23.433 --> 08:26.800
OH, RIGHT. CALL ME WHEN YOU
GET THE TEST RESULTS.

08:28.533 --> 08:30.700
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT IT
WITH YOU.

08:30.733 --> 08:33.600
WELL, IS SHE ALL RIGHT?
YEAH.

08:35.133 --> 08:37.033
SO WHEN GIVING A PATIENT
THE BAD NEWS,

08:37.067 --> 08:39.400
YOU WANT TO BE POLITE
AND DETACHED, BUT NOT COLD.

08:39.433 --> 08:41.767
HOW CAN YOU BE DETACHED
BUT NOT COLD?
YOU SHOW THAT YOU CARE

08:41.800 --> 08:43.700
WITHOUT ACTUALLY ALLOWING
YOURSELF TO CARE,

08:43.733 --> 08:45.633
BECAUSE IF YOU GET
TOO EMOTIONAL,

08:45.667 --> 08:47.833
THEN THEY GET SCARED,
AND THEN THEY GET EMOTIONAL,

08:47.867 --> 08:50.600
AND THAT'S BAD.
SERIOUSLY?

08:50.633 --> 08:52.700
STOP WITH THE SERIOUSLY.
UH, I'M SORRY.

08:52.733 --> 08:55.200
I KNOW IT MUST BE HARD
BEING OLDER THAN MOST OF US,

08:55.233 --> 08:58.100
BUT I THINK YOU'RE GONNA GO
A LOT FURTHER IF YOU JUST

08:58.133 --> 08:59.733
LET EVERYTHING ELSE GO
AND FOCUS ON THE MEDICINE.

08:59.767 --> 09:02.133
HEY, ARE YOU AWARE THAT McDREAMY
AND THE OTHER GREY ARE BONDING?

09:02.167 --> 09:04.333
BONDING?
OVER THEIR MUTUAL
MEREDITH GREYNESS.

09:04.367 --> 09:07.100
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT ME?

09:07.133 --> 09:09.533
WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?
OH, I DON'T KNOW. HE'S MAKING
ME DEAL WITH HIS PATIENTS

09:09.567 --> 09:11.567
WHILE THEY FOCUS ON
WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT--YOU.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.500
CRISTINA!

09:13.533 --> 09:15.767
WHAT WAS I SAYING?
YOU WERE SAYING

09:15.800 --> 09:18.167
HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS
TO FOCUS ON THE MEDICINE.

09:18.200 --> 09:19.500
JUST GIVE ME THE CHART.

09:19.533 --> 09:21.600
FIRST WE'RE GOING TO APPLY
A HALO, WHICH USES

09:21.633 --> 09:24.333
WEIGHTS AND TRACTION TO PULL
YOUR SPINE BACK INTO PLACE.

09:24.367 --> 09:26.433
TRACTION?
LIKE AT THE GYM.

09:26.467 --> 09:28.367
WE STRETCH YOUR UPPER BODY
USING WEIGHTS

09:28.400 --> 09:30.333
UNTIL THE TENSION POPS
THE SPINE INTO POSITION.

09:30.367 --> 09:33.567
EXCEPT UNLIKE AT THE GYM,
DR. SHEPHERD NEEDS TO ATTACH

09:33.600 --> 09:35.700
THE TRACTION DEVICE
DIRECTLY TO YOUR HEAD

09:35.733 --> 09:38.500
BY SCREWING TWO BOLTS
INTO YOUR SKULL.
THAT SOUNDS PAINFUL.

09:38.533 --> 09:40.300
PAINFUL IS IF HE DOESN'T
FIX YOUR SPINE.

09:40.333 --> 09:43.500
PAINFUL IS
YOU NEVER WALK AGAIN.

09:43.533 --> 09:46.433
(sighs) OKAY. WE GONNA
DO THIS THING OR WHAT?

09:48.833 --> 09:52.200
(sobbing)

09:52.233 --> 09:54.133
I TOLD YOU NOT TO GET
TOO EMOTIONAL.

09:54.167 --> 09:55.567
I COULDN'T HELP IT.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.133
WHAT NOW?

09:57.167 --> 09:59.467
(sobbing continues)

09:59.500 --> 10:02.433
GO APOLOGIZE ONE LAST TIME.

10:02.467 --> 10:05.533
(sobbing continues)

10:07.100 --> 10:10.833
ONCE AGAIN, MA'AM,
WE ARE VERY, VERY SORRY...
(sobs loudly)

10:10.867 --> 10:14.033
VERY SORRY.
(sobbing continues)

10:18.667 --> 10:20.533
AND NOW?

10:20.567 --> 10:24.133
NOW WE SLOWLY AND RESPECTFULLY
BACK OUT OF THE ROOM.

10:24.167 --> 10:27.400
(sobbing continues)

10:27.433 --> 10:29.433
ALEX, I NEED A FAVOR.

10:29.467 --> 10:32.533
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR FAVORS.
I'M WORKING HERE.

10:32.567 --> 10:35.133
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
AT LUNCH?
ACCORDING TO MY INTERNS,

10:35.167 --> 10:37.300
I'M WATCHING TORRES
KICK YOUR ASS

10:37.333 --> 10:39.767
ALL UP AND DOWN
THE CAFETERIA.
HOW DO THEY KNOW?

10:39.800 --> 10:41.700
SO IT'S TRUE.
WHAT'D YOU DO TO HER?
NOTHING.

10:41.733 --> 10:45.167
DUDE.
(man) WE NEED
A LITTLE HELP HERE!

10:46.733 --> 10:48.633
OH, THANK GOD.
SOMEBODY I KNOW.

10:48.667 --> 10:51.333
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE MAKE SURE
THEY PAGE MY HUSBAND?

10:51.367 --> 10:53.267
WHO IS SHE?
IT'S THE CHIEF'S NIECE.

10:53.300 --> 10:55.533
(man) CAMILLE TRAVIS, 18,
I TRIED INTUBATING 3 TIMES.

10:55.567 --> 10:58.167
THERE'S SOME KIND
OF OBSTRUCTION.
MY BABY CAN'T BREATHE.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.267
SATs STAYING DOWN.
THEY'RE AT 82%.
SHE NEEDS A SURGICAL AIRWAY.

11:00.300 --> 11:01.633
SOMEBODY GET ME
A CRIKE TRAY.

11:01.667 --> 11:04.133
HOW MANY EMERGENCY CRIKES
HAVE YOU DONE?
INCLUDING THIS ONE? ONE.

11:04.167 --> 11:06.267
DUDE, IT'S THE CHIEF'S NIECE.
(man) PULSE IS
GETTING WEAKER.

11:06.300 --> 11:08.100
SO WE BETTER NOT
SCREW THIS UP.

11:08.133 --> 11:11.400
(Adele) WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
(Alex)
TRYING TO HELP HER BREATHE.

11:11.433 --> 11:14.033
(woman gasps)
SHE JUST SLIT HER THROAT!

11:14.067 --> 11:16.200
SUCTION. I NEED SUCTION.
GET THE RETRACTORS IN.

11:16.233 --> 11:19.167
THERE'S SO MUCH BLOOD. YOU
DIDN'T HIT AN ARTERY, DID YOU?
NO, NOT ON PURPOSE.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.300
OH, GOD. OH, GOD.
GET THE TUBE.

11:21.333 --> 11:23.200
(Adele) OH, GOD.

11:23.233 --> 11:24.200
(gasps)

11:24.233 --> 11:25.767
SATs ARE GOING UP.

11:25.800 --> 11:27.433
OH, WE DID IT.

11:27.467 --> 11:29.800
OH, RICHARD!

11:31.233 --> 11:34.767
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING
TO MY NIECE?

11:39.267 --> 11:41.167
THE ONE THING THIS CHILD
DID NOT NEED

11:41.200 --> 11:42.667
WAS ANOTHER SURGERY.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.700
SHE WASN'T BREATHING,
CHIEF.

11:44.733 --> 11:46.733
(Izzie) WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

11:46.767 --> 11:48.667
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

11:48.700 --> 11:52.400
BUT CAMILLE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH
OVARIAN CANCER WHEN SHE WAS 14.

11:52.433 --> 11:55.633
SHE'S HAD BOTH OVARIES REMOVED,
A HYSTERECTOMY AND NOW THIS--
THERE IT IS, THE MASS.

11:55.667 --> 11:58.633
(Izzie) NO WONDER
SHE COULDN'T BREATHE.
I CAN TAKE IT OUT.

11:58.667 --> 12:01.133
BUT WE WON'T KNOW
HOW MANY MORE THERE ARE

12:01.167 --> 12:03.533
UNTIL WE DO FURTHER STUDIES.

12:03.567 --> 12:06.133
I'M SO SORRY, CHIEF.

12:07.767 --> 12:10.600
SHE BEAT IT TWICE BEFORE.

12:10.633 --> 12:13.167
SHE'LL BEAT IT AGAIN.

12:15.433 --> 12:17.333
I JUST HAD TO TELL
A 48-YEAR-OLD WOMAN

12:17.367 --> 12:18.600
THAT SHE'S GONNA DIE.

12:18.633 --> 12:20.633
YEAH? I WISH I COULD TELL
A 24-YEAR-OLD WOMAN

12:20.667 --> 12:22.700
SHE'S GONNA DIE.
(Lexie) I'M GLAD.

12:22.733 --> 12:25.133
(both laugh)

12:25.167 --> 12:28.033
I HAVE GONE OUT OF MY WAY
TO BE NICE TO HER,

12:28.067 --> 12:30.733
AND THIS IS WHAT SHE DOES,
TALKS ABOUT ME BEHIND MY BACK?

12:30.767 --> 12:33.733
WHEN WERE YOU NICE TO HER?
I WAS NICE... ONCE.

12:33.767 --> 12:35.100
MY POINT IS...

12:35.133 --> 12:37.100
HEY, MEREDITH.
HEY, NORMAN.

12:37.133 --> 12:38.533
'SUP, LEXIE?

12:38.567 --> 12:39.767
(chuckles)

12:39.800 --> 12:42.300
COME ON, NORMAN.

12:42.333 --> 12:44.600
UM... DR. SHEPHERD ASKED

12:44.633 --> 12:47.700
THAT WE MEET IN ADAM'S ROOM
IN TEN MINUTES.

12:47.733 --> 12:50.167
YOU COULD AT LEAST
ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HEARD ME.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.100
YOU'RE USING
THE GREY SISTER ANGLE

12:52.133 --> 12:54.700
TO GET IN GOOD
WITH THE ATTENDINGS.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.400
I GET THAT. BUT YOU'RE HERE
ON MY LICENSE.

12:56.433 --> 12:59.267
SO IF YOU DO ANYTHING,
LIKE KILL SOMEONE, IT'S ON ME.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.200
SO FOR THE REST OF THE DAY,
YOU'RE GONNA HUG THE WALL.

13:01.233 --> 13:04.100
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SAY ANYTHING,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING.

13:04.133 --> 13:07.167
YOU'RE AN INTERN.
ARE WE CLEAR... THREE?

13:08.600 --> 13:09.633
LEXIE.

13:09.667 --> 13:11.233
WHAT?

13:11.267 --> 13:13.200
IT'S LEXIE, OR GREY.

13:13.233 --> 13:15.067
IT'S NOT THREE.

13:15.100 --> 13:17.133
I HAVE A NAME.

13:19.333 --> 13:21.233
(George) YOUR BLOOD TESTS SHOW
LOW ELECTROLYTE LEVELS,

13:21.267 --> 13:23.500
LOW CALCIUM
AND LOW VITAMIN D.

13:23.533 --> 13:24.733
HAVE YOU BEEN DIETING?

13:24.767 --> 13:26.467
SHE JUST LOST 40 POUNDS.

13:26.500 --> 13:30.433
WILL TOLD ME IF I EVER
GOT BACK DOWN TO A SIZE 4,

13:30.467 --> 13:32.300
WE'D MOVE IN TOGETHER.
HOW ROMANTIC.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.267
WE BOTH
JUST NEEDED MOTIVATION.

13:34.300 --> 13:37.167
I TOLD HIM I WOULDN'T LIVE WITH
A SMOKER, SO HE QUIT SMOKING.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.267
THE PROBLEM IS,
EVEN IF DR. TORRES

13:39.300 --> 13:40.833
IS ABLE TO REPAIR
YOUR FRACTURE,

13:40.867 --> 13:43.267
IT WON'T DO ANY GOOD
UNLESS YOU'RE EATING MORE

13:43.300 --> 13:45.367
AND WORKING OUT LESS.

13:45.400 --> 13:48.267
AM I RIGHT, DR. TORRES?
DR. TOR--HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

13:48.300 --> 13:50.067
UH, UH,
DR. BAILEY'S RIGHT.

13:50.100 --> 13:51.833
SO WHAT, YOU'RE SAYING
THAT YOU WON'T OPERATE

13:51.867 --> 13:54.467
UNLESS SHE PUTS ON
A BUNCH OF WEIGHT?
NO, BUT, UM--

13:54.500 --> 13:56.500
THEN WHY ARE WE
STILL TALKING ABOUT THIS?

13:56.533 --> 13:59.567
WE CAME HERE TO GET HER
LEG FIXED. SO FIX HER LEG.

14:01.267 --> 14:03.167
OKAY.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.700
HOW'D THAT DISCHARGE-
TO-HOSPICE PATIENT GO?

14:05.733 --> 14:07.300
NOT GREAT.

14:07.333 --> 14:11.100
THERE WAS CRYING AND TEARS
AND... MORE TEARS.

14:11.133 --> 14:12.733
TEARS? REALLY?

14:12.767 --> 14:14.467
SUCH A TOUGH OLD BIRD.

14:14.500 --> 14:17.567
I THOUGHT HE'D TAKE IT
LIKE A MAN.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.300
"HE'D TAKE IT LIKE A MAN"?

14:20.333 --> 14:21.600
WHAT, I'M SEXIST NOW?

14:21.633 --> 14:24.200
NO, "HE" AS IN "HIM"?

14:24.233 --> 14:25.467
JOEL HANSON IN 2212.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.567
NOT GRETCHEN BITZER
IN 2213?

14:27.600 --> 14:30.433
OH, DEAR. I THOUGHT
THAT "2" WAS A "3."

14:30.467 --> 14:32.167
DR. GREY, DID YOU
AND YOUR INTERN

14:32.200 --> 14:34.600
TELL A WOMAN WHO CAME IN
TO HAVE HER MOLES REMOVED

14:34.633 --> 14:36.533
THAT SHE WAS DYING?
OH, DEAR.

14:36.567 --> 14:38.767
I MEAN, CRAP. OH, CRAP.

14:41.500 --> 14:44.300
YOU HEAR THAT?
LIKE A WEIGHT ROOM.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.433
THERE'S NOTHING
TO BE SCARED OF.

14:46.467 --> 14:49.100
HE'S BEEN WEIGHT TRAINING
SINCE HE WAS 8 YEARS OLD.

14:49.133 --> 14:51.333
(low voice) WHAT DID I SAY
ABOUT YOU AND THE WALL?

14:51.367 --> 14:53.267
DR. YANG, THIS IS STILL
A TEACHING HOSPITAL, ISN'T IT?

14:53.300 --> 14:55.767
(normal voice) YES, SIR.
YOU NEED TO GET
A LITTLE CLOSER

14:55.800 --> 14:58.167
IF YOU WANT TO LEARN
SOMETHING TODAY, DR. GREY.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.767
OKAY, ADAM, I'M GOING TO
ATTACH THE TONGS NOW.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.500
I NEED YOU TO STAY PERFECTLY
STILL DURING THIS PROCEDURE.

15:02.533 --> 15:04.400
LET THE WEIGHTS
DO ALL THE WORK.

15:04.433 --> 15:06.100
OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA FEEL
A LITTLE PRESSURE,

15:06.133 --> 15:09.267
BUT WITH THE MEDS
WE'VE GIVEN YOU,

15:09.300 --> 15:11.667
YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL ANY PAIN.

15:11.700 --> 15:14.233
ALL RIGHT. HERE WE GO.

15:15.833 --> 15:18.333
CAN YOU IMAGINE BEING
14 YEARS OLD

15:18.367 --> 15:21.233
AND HAVING SOME DOCTOR
TELL YOU YOU'VE GOT CANCER?

15:21.267 --> 15:23.167
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT?

15:23.200 --> 15:25.100
WELL, YOU FIGHT.
CAMILLE'S A FIGHTER.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.700
YOU TWO HAVE THAT IN COMMON.
HA HA.

15:27.733 --> 15:29.733
SO WHAT'S IT GONNA BE,
STEVENS GETS HER BONES BROKEN

15:29.767 --> 15:31.667
OR TORRES GETS TAKEN
TO THE TRAILER PARK?

15:31.700 --> 15:33.333
NEITHER.
IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

15:33.367 --> 15:35.167
BUT IF IT DOES, WILL YOU
PULL HER OFF ME?

15:35.200 --> 15:39.200
YOU GONNA TELL ME
WHAT YOU DID TO HER?
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE NOT TO
SAY ANYTHING TO ANYBODY.

15:39.233 --> 15:42.200
SWEAR.
I SWEAR. JEEZ.

15:43.367 --> 15:45.767
I SLEPT WITH GEORGE.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.800
I KNOW. I KNOW.
I'M A TERRIBLE PERSON.

15:47.833 --> 15:50.700
WHICH IS WHY I'M GONNA LET HER
GET ONE GOOD PUNCH IN.

15:50.733 --> 15:52.633
MAYBE TWO. I DESERVE IT.

15:52.667 --> 15:55.033
NO, ONE. THEN YOU
PULL HER OFF ME.

15:55.067 --> 15:56.667
YOU SLEPT WITH O'MALLEY?

15:56.700 --> 16:00.500
ALEX, YOU JUST SAID
YOU WOULDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
I WON'T, BELIEVE ME.

16:00.533 --> 16:03.067
THIS...
I'M EMBARRASSED FOR YOU.

16:03.100 --> 16:04.567
(Meredith) YOU HAD ONE JOB--

16:04.600 --> 16:06.167
ONE JOB--
READ THE CHARTS.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.167
YOU WANT TO YELL AT ME
SOME MORE?

16:08.200 --> 16:10.633
YOU CAN, BECAUSE I AM AN INTERN
AND ACCORDING TO DR. BAILEY,

16:10.667 --> 16:13.500
YELLING IS HOW WE LEARN.
WELL, I'M NOT
A VERY GOOD YELLER.

16:13.533 --> 16:15.200
OH, I'M SURE
IT JUST TAKES PRACTICE.

16:15.233 --> 16:18.400
PERHAPS MS. BITZER
WILL SHOW US HOW IT'S DONE.
JUST LET ME
DO ALL THE TALKING.

16:18.433 --> 16:20.633
MS. BITZER...
GRETCHEN.

16:20.667 --> 16:22.700
SHE LEFT ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.
SHE'S GONE?
LEFT THE HOSPITAL?

16:22.733 --> 16:24.133
MM-HMM.

16:24.167 --> 16:26.167
FEEL LIKE YELLING NOW?

16:28.167 --> 16:29.833
YOUR C.T. RESULTS SHOWED

16:29.867 --> 16:32.200
THAT NOT ONLY
IS THE CANCER BACK,

16:32.233 --> 16:34.600
IT'S SPREAD TO YOUR CHEST,
LUNGS AND THROAT.

16:34.633 --> 16:37.100
WE HAVE OPTIONS, THOUGH.

16:37.133 --> 16:38.467
WE CAN OPERATE.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.400
WE CAN BE EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE
WITH THE CHEMO

16:40.433 --> 16:42.333
AND RADIATION
THAN THE LAST TIME.

16:42.367 --> 16:44.300
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.

16:44.333 --> 16:46.533
WE COULD TRY
TO TREAT YOU AT HOME,

16:46.567 --> 16:48.467
BUT, CAMILLE, YOU--

16:48.500 --> 16:50.300
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.733
I DON'T WANT ANY TREATMENT.

16:52.767 --> 16:54.733
(Adele) WHAT?
(woman) CAMILLE,
DON'T SAY THAT.

16:54.767 --> 16:57.367
I'VE TRIED, MAMA.
IT'S NOT WORKING.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.033
I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE.

16:59.067 --> 17:02.733
YOU CAN AND YOU WILL.
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

17:02.767 --> 17:05.367
I'M 18 NOW, AUNT ADELE.
I DO HAVE A CHOICE.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.367
YOU MAY BE 18, BABY GIRL,

17:07.400 --> 17:09.467
BUT YOU ARE
CLEARLY NOT CAPABLE

17:09.500 --> 17:11.267
OF MAKING
LIFE-AND-DEATH DECISIONS

17:11.300 --> 17:13.367
FOR YOURSELF RIGHT NOW.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.300
TELL HER, RICHARD.
CAMILLE--

17:15.333 --> 17:17.367
NO, YOU TELL HER.

17:17.400 --> 17:20.267
TELL HER HOW THE RADIATION
ALMOST KILLED ME LAST TIME,

17:20.300 --> 17:23.267
HOW I GOT HEPATITIS
AND MY KIDNEYS SHUT DOWN

17:23.300 --> 17:25.700
AND MY SKIN WAS SO RAW
I COULDN'T BE TOUCHED.

17:25.733 --> 17:26.800
CAMILLE--

17:26.833 --> 17:30.067
I'M DYING.
WE ALL KNOW THAT.

17:30.100 --> 17:33.300
I DON'T WANT TO SPEND
WHAT LITTLE TIME I HAVE LEFT

17:33.333 --> 17:35.133
IN THIS HOSPITAL.

17:35.167 --> 17:37.067
I WANT TO SPEND TIME
WITH MY FRIENDS.

17:37.100 --> 17:39.233
I WANT TO SLEEP IN MY OWN BED,

17:39.267 --> 17:42.267
AND I WANT TO BE HOME.

17:42.300 --> 17:46.667
SO PLEASE DON'T BE MY DOCTOR
RIGHT NOW.

17:46.700 --> 17:50.567
BE MY UNCLE WHO LOVES ME.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.300
LET ME GO HOME.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.533
***

17:57.233 --> 17:59.133
(Cristina) TRY NOT TO MOVE
YOUR HEAD, ADAM.

17:59.167 --> 18:01.333
I'M--I'M TRYING, BUT...

18:01.367 --> 18:04.333
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER
I CAN TAKE THIS.

18:04.367 --> 18:06.533
YOU'LL TAKE AS MUCH
AS THEY GIVE YOU, SON.

18:06.567 --> 18:08.633
OKAY, NOW COME ON!
YOU CAN DO THIS.
IT'S JUST ANOTHER FEW POUNDS.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.800
DR. YANG, MAYBE WE SHOULD--
NO ONE ASKED YOU.

18:10.833 --> 18:13.733
(Adam) I-I CAN'T.
PLEASE TAKE IT OFF.

18:13.767 --> 18:16.567
NO, NO. CAN'T QUIT.
PUSH THROUGH IT.
OKAY, JUST ONE MORE PLATE.

18:16.600 --> 18:17.933
ADAM, YOU'RE STRONG.
YOU CAN HANDLE THIS.

18:17.967 --> 18:20.300
WANT TO BE A QUITTER, DO YOU?
HUH, DO YOU?
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:20.333 --> 18:22.167
THAT'S IT. THAT'S IT.
THAT'S 20 POUNDS.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.167
THERE, YOU DID IT. RIGHT?

18:24.200 --> 18:25.700
TOLD YOU
YOU COULD DO IT.

18:25.733 --> 18:27.533
SOMEBODY GET HIM OUT.
PLEASE.

18:27.567 --> 18:30.067
SOMEBODY GET HIM OUT.
ADAM, I'M JUST TRYING
TO HELP OUT.

18:30.100 --> 18:32.800
PLEASE GET OUT! GET OUT!
GET OUT! GET OUT!
ADAM, ADAM, CALM DOWN.

18:32.833 --> 18:35.400
TRY NOT TO UPSET HIM. ADAM.
GET--GET--

18:35.433 --> 18:37.467
(Cristina) ADAM, CALM DOWN.
ADAM, IT'S O--
IT'S OKAY.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.467
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
DON'T TOUCH HIM.

18:39.500 --> 18:40.633
THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT
COULD--

18:40.667 --> 18:43.233
PUT HIS HAND DOWN, GENTLY.

18:43.267 --> 18:45.800
I'M SO SORRY. I FORGOT.
NOW STEP AWAY
FROM THE PATIENT

18:45.833 --> 18:47.167
AND LEAVE THE ROOM.

18:47.200 --> 18:50.367
GET OUT RIGHT NOW
OR I WILL THROW YOU OUT.

18:50.400 --> 18:52.800
DR. GREY,
TAKE OVER FOR DR. YANG.

18:52.833 --> 18:55.800
DR. YANG, A WORD.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.333
YOU ARE A RESIDENT NOW.

19:00.367 --> 19:03.233
YOUR JOB IS TO TEACH INTERNS,
NOT ABUSE THEM.

19:03.267 --> 19:05.167
I WASN'T. SHE GRABBED HIS--
UNTIL YOU LEARN TO BE

19:05.200 --> 19:06.400
LESS COMPETITIVE
AND LESS SELFISH,

19:06.433 --> 19:08.467
YOU WILL NOT ASSIST
ON MY SURGERIES.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.400
YOU WILL OBSERVE THEM.
BUT SHE--

19:10.433 --> 19:12.433
YOU CAN GO.

19:12.467 --> 19:13.800
ARLENE, SHE'S JUST TIRED.

19:13.833 --> 19:15.733
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S SAYING.

19:15.767 --> 19:19.500
BUT SHE'S RIGHT.
SHE'S NOT GONNA GET ANY BETTER.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.700
WE DON'T KNOW THAT, ARLENE.
THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE.

19:21.733 --> 19:23.633
NOT IF SHE DOESN'T
GET TREATMENT.

19:23.667 --> 19:25.567
YOU'VE GOT TO TALK TO HER,
RICHARD.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.433
YOU'VE--
YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE HER.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.333
SHE LOVES YOU.
SHE TRUSTS YOU.

19:29.367 --> 19:32.467
AND SHE'S THE CLOSEST THING
WE HAVE TO A CHILD OF OUR OWN.

19:32.500 --> 19:36.067
RICHARD, I'M BEGGING YOU.
PLEASE.

19:36.100 --> 19:38.100
SAVE OUR BABY GIRL.

19:41.867 --> 19:43.500
AGAIN, MS. BITZER,

19:43.533 --> 19:45.667
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT YOU CALL US BACK.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.567
YOU IDIOTS
STILL CAN'T FIND HER?

19:47.600 --> 19:51.433
(Meredith) I CALLED HER HOME,
HER CELL, HER NEXT OF KIN.
I DON'T CARE

19:51.467 --> 19:53.333
IF YOU HAVE TO CALL
EVERY BITZER ON THE PLANET.

19:53.367 --> 19:55.033
FIND HER!

19:55.067 --> 19:57.433
I AM REALLY SO VERY SORRY
ABOUT THIS.

19:57.467 --> 20:00.100
IT'S NOT ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT,
NORMAN. YOU'RE JUST AN INTERN.

20:00.133 --> 20:02.200
I SHOULD'VE DOUBLE-CHECKED
THE CHARTS.

20:02.233 --> 20:05.100
I WAS DISTRACTED BY THINGS
I SHOULDN'T BE DISTRACTED BY.

20:05.133 --> 20:06.633
FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

20:06.667 --> 20:08.633
LEXIE GREY IS A GOOD GIRL.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.567
SHE'S VERY SWEET.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.500
I DON'T THINK SHE WOULD SAY
ANYTHING UNTOWARD...

20:12.533 --> 20:14.067
OR UNCOOL.

20:17.733 --> 20:20.767
I HAVE BITZERS TO CALL.

20:20.800 --> 20:24.100
BUT, YOU KNOW,
YOU COULD TAKE THE... NORMAN?

20:24.133 --> 20:26.600
NORMAN?

20:26.633 --> 20:28.533
I'M NOT A BAD RESIDENT,
AM I?

20:28.567 --> 20:30.700
DON'T ASK ME.
I LOST A PATIENT TODAY.

20:30.733 --> 20:33.400
OH, YOU KILLED SOMEONE?
LOST. LITERALLY CAN'T FIND.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.467
OH. SHEPHERD SAYS I'M SELFISH
AND COMPETITIVE.

20:36.500 --> 20:38.667
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH THAT?

20:38.700 --> 20:41.400
I KICK ASS.
I'M AN EXCELLENT RESIDENT.
I'M NOT.

20:41.433 --> 20:43.500
IN ADDITION
TO LOSING MY PATIENT,

20:43.533 --> 20:45.133
I ALSO LOST MY INTERN.

20:45.167 --> 20:47.067
TURNED AROUND,
HE WAS GONE. AWOL.

20:47.100 --> 20:48.667
SEE, WHAT--WHAT IS WRONG
WITH THESE INTERNS?

20:48.700 --> 20:50.600
WE WEREN'T LIKE THIS.
WE WERE GREAT INTERNS.

20:50.633 --> 20:53.567
I WAS GREAT.
YOU WERE--YOU WERE GOOD.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.800
YOU GUYS SEEN CALLIE?

20:54.833 --> 20:58.533
NO. OOH! IS IT TIME FOR HER
TO GRIND YOUR BONES INTO DUST?

20:58.567 --> 21:00.667
YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN TAKE HER?
ARE YOU GUYS
REALLY DOING THIS?

21:00.700 --> 21:02.467
YOU HEARD?
THE WHOLE HOSPITAL HEARD.

21:02.500 --> 21:05.267
YEAH, WELL, THAT EXPLAINS
THE LINE AT THE SALAD BAR.
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
FIGHTING ABOUT?

21:05.300 --> 21:07.233
BELIEVE ME,
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.
ALEX.

21:07.267 --> 21:10.167
I'M JUST SAYING, WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.433
ACTUALLY, IT IS. SOME THINGS
ARE WORTH FIGHTING FOR.

21:14.667 --> 21:18.467
***

21:18.500 --> 21:20.067
O'MALLEY.

21:20.100 --> 21:22.633
PICKING UP REPEAT LABS
FOR RUTHIE SAYLES.
SO WHO'S YOUR MONEY ON,
O'MALLEY?

21:22.667 --> 21:24.567
GUESS YOU GOTTA BACK
THE WIFE, HUH?

21:24.600 --> 21:26.500
WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
THE FIGHT DOWNSTAIRS.

21:26.533 --> 21:27.967
TORRES vs. STEVENS.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.367
WHAT ARE THEY FIGHTING ABOUT
ANYWAY?
OH, MAILE,
THAT'S JUST A RUMOR.

21:30.400 --> 21:33.200
IT'S NOT HAPPENING. CALLIE IS
WAY TOO MATURE FOR THAT.

21:33.233 --> 21:37.100
THAT'S NOT WHAT MY BUDDY
IN THE CAFETERIA JUST SAID.

21:37.133 --> 21:38.067
(music stops)

21:38.100 --> 21:39.833
***

21:39.867 --> 21:42.467
O'MALLEY, YOUR LABS!
GOTTA GO!
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK!

21:42.500 --> 21:44.633
I'M JUST SAYING, I LEARNED HOW
TO FIGHT IN A TRAILER PARK.

21:44.667 --> 21:47.100
OKAY? WHERE'D SHE LEARN
TO FIGHT, BOARDING SCHOOL?

21:47.133 --> 21:48.667
NOT QUITE THE SAME THING.

21:48.700 --> 21:51.567
(ticking)

21:51.600 --> 21:54.600
***

22:01.733 --> 22:03.800
I'M A STREET FIGHTER.
I'VE GOT SOME BADASS IN ME.

22:03.833 --> 22:05.800
I COULD TAKE A GIRL DOWN.

22:05.833 --> 22:07.667
***

22:07.700 --> 22:10.533
(Meredith) IZZIE.

22:10.567 --> 22:13.433
***

22:13.467 --> 22:15.467
(Alex) PUNCH WITH YOUR LEFT.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.667
PROTECT YOUR FACE
WITH YOUR RIGHT.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.600
NO, YOUR HANDS--
PROTECT YOUR SURGEON HANDS.

22:19.633 --> 22:22.033
YOUR FACE CAN HEAL.

22:22.067 --> 22:25.067
***

22:25.100 --> 22:27.267
HERE WE GO.

22:27.300 --> 22:31.100
(clears throat)
STEVENS.

22:31.133 --> 22:32.700
LET'S DO THIS.

22:32.733 --> 22:35.533
LET'S GO.

22:35.567 --> 22:37.433
LET'S GO.
GO WHERE?

22:37.467 --> 22:39.667
YOU KNOW, GO.

22:39.700 --> 22:42.233
***

22:42.267 --> 22:44.533
I WANTED TO TALK.

22:44.567 --> 22:46.200
(music stops)

22:46.233 --> 22:49.667
YOU WANT TO TALK.
YOU DON'T WANT TO KICK MY ASS?

22:49.700 --> 22:51.600
YOU THOUGHT
I WAS GONNA FIGHT YOU?

22:51.633 --> 22:54.067
YOU... THAT'S CR--

23:08.467 --> 23:11.033
(sighs)

23:14.067 --> 23:15.567
EXCUSE ME.

23:15.600 --> 23:18.000
SORRY. (clears throat)

23:19.500 --> 23:21.533
THAT'S A FORFEIT.
TORRES FORFEITS.
OH, MAN.

23:21.567 --> 23:23.667
OH, MY GOD.

23:23.700 --> 23:26.600
YOU WERE
VERY GHETTO FABULOUS.

23:26.633 --> 23:29.400
OH, MY GOD.

23:31.200 --> 23:33.367
WHAT HAPPENED?
WAS THERE A FIGHT?
(scoffs) NO.

23:33.400 --> 23:36.200
GUESS THEY REALIZED THEY WERE
FIGHTING OVER NOTHING.

23:43.633 --> 23:46.400
HEY, WHAT DO YOU THINK'S
A BETTER WEEKEND GETAWAY,

23:46.433 --> 23:47.467
NAPA OR SONOMA?

23:47.500 --> 23:50.267
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
IF I KILL YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

23:50.300 --> 23:52.700
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

23:52.733 --> 23:56.100
SECOND OF ALL, I DO MIND.
INTERNS SHOULD BE SEEN
AND NOT HEARD.

23:56.133 --> 23:58.333
THEY SHOULDN'T TALK
TO PATIENTS.
THAT'S HOW THEY LEARN.

23:58.367 --> 24:00.267
WHICH MEANS I HAVE TO TEACH,
AND THEN I HAVE TO DEAL

24:00.300 --> 24:02.200
WITH THEIR PROBLEMS
WHEN THEY SCREW UP.

24:02.233 --> 24:04.067
MEREDITH RARELY SCREWS UP,
AND SHE'S NOT AN INTERN.

24:04.100 --> 24:05.833
SO NAPA OR SONOMA,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

24:05.867 --> 24:07.500
SONOMA.
MM.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.600
SMALLER HOTELS,
FEWER TOURISTS.

24:09.633 --> 24:12.467
AND MEREDITH...
SHE'S STILL AN INTERN.

24:12.500 --> 24:13.800
DON'T KID YOURSELF.

24:13.833 --> 24:16.367
SHE'S GREEN, SHE'S A BABY,
AND THE ONLY DIFFERENCE

24:16.400 --> 24:18.533
BETWEEN HER AND THAT OLD GUY
SHE'S GOT TRAILING HER

24:18.567 --> 24:21.533
IS THAT YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING
WITH THE OLD GUY.

24:21.567 --> 24:23.067
SORRY I'M LATE.

24:23.100 --> 24:25.700
WELL, I WAS JUST
EXPLAINING THE SURGERY.
OH.

24:25.733 --> 24:27.733
SINCE YOUR BONES
HAVE SPLINTERED,

24:27.767 --> 24:30.533
DR. TORRES WILL PLACE
METAL PLATES AND SCREWS

24:30.567 --> 24:32.833
TO HOLD THE ANKLE TOGETHER.
HOW LONG WILL
THE RECOVERY TIME BE?

24:32.867 --> 24:35.533
IT'S HARD TO SAY.
YOU'LL BE IN A CAST

24:35.567 --> 24:37.533
8 TO 12 WEEKS.

24:37.567 --> 24:39.133
THREE MONTHS?

24:39.167 --> 24:41.500
RIGHT, DR. TORRES?
LONGER IF SHE DOESN'T EAT.

24:41.533 --> 24:44.567
SHE EATS.
NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP
HER BONES FROM SNAPPING,

24:44.600 --> 24:46.700
BUT YOU DON'T SEEM
TOO CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.

24:46.733 --> 24:48.733
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM, LADY?
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.

24:48.767 --> 24:50.667
(Ruthie coughing)
I'M NOT THE ONE WHO
HAS TO LIVE WITH YOU.

24:50.700 --> 24:53.300
YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS--
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM--
(Miranda) RUTHIE!

24:53.333 --> 24:56.767
RUTHIE...
IN HERE. GO AHEAD.
IN HERE.

24:59.467 --> 25:00.567
I THOUGHT RUTHIE

25:00.600 --> 25:02.767
WASN'T GOING INTO SURGERY
TILL TOMORROW.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.400
THAT'S BEFORE SHE STARTED
VOMITING BLOOD.

25:04.433 --> 25:07.067
SHE'S GOT A BLEEDING
DUODENAL ULCER.
HOW DID WE NOT SEE THIS?

25:07.100 --> 25:09.533
SHE CAME IN
WITH A BROKEN ANKLE.

25:09.567 --> 25:12.167
HER MALNUTRITION AND THE AMOUNT
OF IBUPROFEN SHE'S BEEN TAKING,

25:12.200 --> 25:14.200
SHE'S LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.
(George) WHY DID SHE
DO THIS TO HERSELF?

25:14.233 --> 25:17.167
'CAUSE PEOPLE ARE STUPID
AND JUST WANT TO BE LOVED.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.533
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
ANYBODY DOES ANYTHING.

25:19.567 --> 25:21.167
(monitor beeping erratically)

25:21.200 --> 25:23.367
(George) ASYSTOLE.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.367
ALL RIGHT. START C.P.R.

25:25.400 --> 25:26.633
(beeping continues)

25:26.667 --> 25:29.233
YOU THINK HE'LL WALK AGAIN?

25:29.267 --> 25:30.467
IT'S NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

25:30.500 --> 25:32.400
MM. WE HAVE A BLEEDER.

25:32.433 --> 25:35.467
I NEED YOU TO CAUTERIZE
THE VEIN, DR. GREY.

25:35.500 --> 25:37.300
OH, OKAY. I...

25:38.733 --> 25:41.600
I, UM...
I-I CAN'T FIND IT.

25:41.633 --> 25:43.767
I-I-I CAN'T SEE
WHERE IT STARTS.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.433
UM...

25:45.467 --> 25:46.767
IT'S COMING TOO QUICKLY.

25:46.800 --> 25:48.533
STOP. SUCTION AROUND IT.

25:48.567 --> 25:51.200
YOU HAVE TO SEE WHERE
THE BLEED IS COMING FROM FIRST.

25:51.233 --> 25:52.600
FOLLOW THE FLOW
TO THE SOURCE. GOOD.

25:52.633 --> 25:54.700
OKAY, NOW BOVIE IT.

25:54.733 --> 25:56.267
GOT IT.

25:56.300 --> 25:58.833
GOOD JOB.

25:58.867 --> 26:02.033
DR. YANG, IF YOU DON'T MIND
STEPPING IN?

26:04.600 --> 26:05.767
DR. GREY.

26:05.800 --> 26:08.200
NORMAN,
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I WAS--

26:08.233 --> 26:10.567
NORMAN, DO YOU THINK YOU CAN
JUST CUT OUT ON ME

26:10.600 --> 26:13.467
IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRISIS?
I-I WENT--

26:13.500 --> 26:15.467
WHERE, NORMAN? WHERE DID YOU GO
THAT WAS IMPORTANT ENOUGH

26:15.500 --> 26:17.700
TO JUST DISAPPEAR
IN THE MIDDLE OF A SHIFT?
MS. BITZER'S APARTMENT.

26:17.733 --> 26:21.133
YOU WENT TO
MS. BITZER'S APARTMENT.
I TOLD HER SHE HAD
A BILL OUTSTANDING.

26:21.167 --> 26:22.533
SHE'S RIGHT BEHIND ME.
OH.

26:22.567 --> 26:25.167
OH, BUT IF I MAY SAY SO,

26:25.200 --> 26:27.200
YOUR YELLING
HAS IMPROVED REMARKABLY.
THANK YOU.

26:27.233 --> 26:28.733
I-I'M SORRY
I MISSED YOUR CALLS.

26:28.767 --> 26:30.733
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO CUT OUT ON MY BILL.

26:30.767 --> 26:33.633
IT'S JUST,
I GOT A LOT OF LIVING TO DO

26:33.667 --> 26:36.367
AND NOT A LOT OF TIME
TO DO IT IN.
ACTUALLY--

26:36.400 --> 26:38.800
I QUIT MY JOB,
DUMPED MY LOSER BOYFRIEND,

26:38.833 --> 26:40.600
TOLD MY BOSS
WHERE HE COULD SHOVE IT,

26:40.633 --> 26:42.333
AND BOUGHT A ONE-WAY TICKET
TO ICELAND,

26:42.367 --> 26:44.467
WHERE THE SUN NEVER SETS,
WHICH IS FINE BY ME.

26:44.500 --> 26:47.267
I'LL SLEEP
WHEN I'M DEAD, RIGHT?
YOU'RE, UH,

26:47.300 --> 26:49.200
NOT GOING TO DIE,
MS. BITZER.

26:49.233 --> 26:52.067
I'M NOT?
THERE WAS A MIX-UP
WITH YOUR LABS.

26:52.100 --> 26:53.767
YOU'RE GOING TO LIVE,

26:53.800 --> 26:57.200
HOPEFULLY A VERY LONG,
HEALTHY LIFE.

26:59.400 --> 27:02.267
(crying) I QUIT MY JOB.

27:02.300 --> 27:04.500
I BROKE UP
WITH MY BOYFRIEND.

27:04.533 --> 27:08.100
I GAVE UP MY APARTMENT.

27:08.133 --> 27:10.200
(sobbing)

27:10.233 --> 27:12.800
YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS
TO FIND AN APARTMENT...

27:12.833 --> 27:15.033
WITH PARKING?

27:15.067 --> 27:16.267
(sobs)

27:16.300 --> 27:20.000
(thunder rumbling)

27:26.700 --> 27:28.567
I THOUGHT YOU QUIT SMOKING.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.267
WASN'T THAT THE DEAL?

27:30.300 --> 27:33.167
RUTHIE LOSES 40 POUNDS,
YOU QUIT SMOKING?

27:33.200 --> 27:34.533
MY GIRLFRIEND'S
IN EMERGENCY SURGERY.

27:34.567 --> 27:37.100
I THINK SHE'LL FORGIVE ME
FOR SMOKING.

27:37.133 --> 27:40.800
NO, NO, SHE WON'T,
BECAUSE SHE'S DEAD.

27:40.833 --> 27:43.600
RUTHIE'S DEAD.

27:43.633 --> 27:45.533
DR. BAILEY TRIED
TO STOP THE BLEEDING,

27:45.567 --> 27:48.367
BUT BECAUSE SHE WAS
STARVING HERSELF

27:48.400 --> 27:49.567
AND OVER TRAINING,

27:49.600 --> 27:51.367
HER HEART
COULDN'T TAKE THE STRAIN.

27:51.400 --> 27:53.267
YOU THINK THIS IS MY FAULT?

27:53.300 --> 27:55.333
SHE WANTED
TO LOSE THE WEIGHT.

27:55.367 --> 27:58.500
I JUST WANTED HER
TO BE HEALTHY.
SHE WAS HEALTHY
20 POUNDS AGO.

27:58.533 --> 28:00.667
YOU JUST WANTED HER TO BE HOT,

28:00.700 --> 28:03.367
ESPECIALLY IF YOU WERE GONNA
MOVE IN WITH HER, RIGHT?
NO, THAT...

28:03.400 --> 28:05.300
I LOVED HER.
YOU DIDN'T LOVE HER.

28:05.333 --> 28:07.233
YOU JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO BE ALONE

28:07.267 --> 28:09.467
OR MAYBE--MAYBE SHE WAS
GOOD FOR YOUR EGO OR--OR MAYBE

28:09.500 --> 28:11.600
SHE MADE YOU FEEL BETTER ABOUT
YOUR MISERABLE LIFE,

28:11.633 --> 28:13.367
BUT YOU DIDN'T LOVE HER

28:13.400 --> 28:15.433
BECAUSE YOU DON'T DESTROY
THE PERSON THAT YOU LOVE!
CALLIE!

28:15.467 --> 28:17.167
GET HER AWAY FROM ME, MAN.
GET HER AWAY FROM ME.

28:17.200 --> 28:18.667
OH, WHAT? YOU GONNA HIT ME?
YOU GONNA HIT ME? GO AHEAD!

28:18.700 --> 28:20.433
GIVE ME ANY EXCUSE TO KICK
SOMEBODY'S ASS TODAY

28:20.467 --> 28:22.367
BECAUSE I AM DYING TO!
DON'T TOUCH ME!

28:22.400 --> 28:24.067
(Miranda)
DR. TORRES! DR. TORRES!

28:24.100 --> 28:26.067
UH, SIR, WE ARE SO SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

28:26.100 --> 28:27.300
O'MALLEY, PLEASE TAKE--

28:27.333 --> 28:29.633
SIR, WHY DON'T YOU COME
WITH ME?

28:29.667 --> 28:32.100
COME ON.

28:35.600 --> 28:38.300
OKAY, I'M GONNA ASK YOU
ONE LAST TIME,

28:38.333 --> 28:40.467
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

28:40.500 --> 28:44.033
(thunder rumbles)

28:44.067 --> 28:45.800
I'M FINE. IT'S NOTHING.

28:45.833 --> 28:46.933
REALLY?

28:46.967 --> 28:51.033
'CAUSE NOTHING ALMOST COST YOU
YOUR CAREER JUST NOW.

29:06.400 --> 29:08.800
THE MASS WE REMOVED
FROM YOUR THROAT

29:08.833 --> 29:11.433
WAS SO BIG
YOU COULDN'T BREATHE.

29:13.100 --> 29:15.167
CAMILLE...

29:15.200 --> 29:18.133
WHAT TOOK YOU
SO LONG TO COME IN?

29:18.167 --> 29:22.067
***

29:22.100 --> 29:25.033
I KNEW THE CANCER
WASN'T GONE.

29:25.067 --> 29:26.567
IT'S NEVER BEEN GONE.

29:26.600 --> 29:30.200
IT'S NEVER GONNA BE GONE.

29:30.233 --> 29:32.267
AND... DON'T TELL MY MOM,

29:32.300 --> 29:35.433
BUT THE TRUTH IS...

29:35.467 --> 29:39.833
I WAS HOPING IT WOULD KILL ME
BEFORE I HAD TO COME BACK HERE.

29:39.867 --> 29:44.600
I'M JUST SO TIRED,
UNCLE RICHARD.

29:44.633 --> 29:48.667
I AM SO, SO TIRED.

29:48.700 --> 29:51.700
***

29:59.267 --> 30:01.700
CAMILLE...

30:01.733 --> 30:05.567
WHAT I HAVE HERE IS A PLAN
TO KEEP YOU ALIVE.

30:05.600 --> 30:08.833
IT INVOLVES 12 ONCOLOGISTS,

30:08.867 --> 30:10.533
8 NEW DRUGS,

30:10.567 --> 30:11.733
SIX EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS

30:11.767 --> 30:13.433
FROM
THREE DIFFERENT CONTINENTS.

30:13.467 --> 30:15.767
I HAVE NO IDEA IF IT'LL WORK.

30:15.800 --> 30:19.367
BUT AS YOUR UNCLE...

30:19.400 --> 30:22.467
I'M BEGGING YOU
TO TAKE IT.

30:22.500 --> 30:25.100
BECAUSE I KNOW FOR A FACT

30:25.133 --> 30:27.067
THE WORLD--

30:27.100 --> 30:29.533
MY WORLD--

30:29.567 --> 30:33.433
IS A BETTER PLACE
WITH YOU IN IT.

30:33.467 --> 30:34.700
HOWEVER...

30:34.733 --> 30:37.600
AS YOUR DOCTOR,

30:37.633 --> 30:41.567
I PROMISE TO DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT.

30:43.300 --> 30:46.333
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.

30:48.067 --> 30:50.100
THEN LET'S GET YOU HOME.

30:50.133 --> 30:54.100
***

31:01.367 --> 31:03.267
CALLIE. CALLIE, WAIT.

31:03.300 --> 31:05.367
PLEASE, WAIT. PLEASE.

31:05.400 --> 31:08.233
***

31:08.267 --> 31:12.200
I'M SORRY...
ABOUT THE CAFETERIA.

31:12.233 --> 31:15.100
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME.

31:15.133 --> 31:17.800
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO KILL ME.

31:17.833 --> 31:20.767
***

31:20.800 --> 31:23.500
I'M SORRY ABOUT EVERYTHING.

31:23.533 --> 31:26.433
WITH GEORGE, I...

31:26.467 --> 31:29.300
I'M REALLY SORRY.

31:29.333 --> 31:30.667
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

31:30.700 --> 31:33.700
***

31:39.367 --> 31:42.267
YOU FEEL TERRIBLE?

31:42.300 --> 31:44.467
YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE.
HE WAS YOUR BEST FRIEND.

31:44.500 --> 31:47.367
I TRIED TO TRUST YOU...
SO MUCH, I HAD CONVINCED MYSELF

31:47.400 --> 31:50.233
THAT IT WAS ALL IN MY HEAD,
THAT I WAS CRAZY.

31:50.267 --> 31:52.167
BUT I WASN'T, WAS I?

31:52.200 --> 31:54.300
AND THEN YOU PULL THAT THING
IN THE CAFETERIA TODAY?

31:54.333 --> 31:56.233
IT'S NOT BAD ENOUGH
THAT YOU HUMILIATE ME

31:56.267 --> 31:58.167
BY GETTING IN BED
WITH MY HUSBAND.

31:58.200 --> 32:00.033
YOU HAVE TO HUMILIATE ME
AT WORK, TOO.

32:00.067 --> 32:03.067
GEORGE MIGHT BE THE ONE
THAT BROKE HIS VOWS, BUT YOU...

32:03.100 --> 32:06.300
WE'RE WOMEN, IZZIE.
YOU DID THIS TO ANOTHER WOMAN.

32:06.333 --> 32:09.600
YOU...
TOOK SOMETHING FROM ME.

32:09.633 --> 32:12.500
YOU STOLE SOMETHING FROM ME
LIKE A PETTY LITTLE THIEF.

32:12.533 --> 32:14.567
YOU ARE THE ONE
WHO SHOULD BE HUMILIATED.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.567
YOU ARE THE ONE
WHO SHOULD BE ASHAMED.

32:16.600 --> 32:19.233
YOU ARE THE ONE WHO SHOULD...

32:19.267 --> 32:23.133
***

32:23.167 --> 32:25.467
DON'T YOU DARE COME TO ME
FOR FORGIVENESS,

32:25.500 --> 32:27.667
YOU TRAITOROUS BITCH.

32:27.700 --> 32:30.700
***

32:39.533 --> 32:42.333
WHAT, I'M INVISIBLE NOW?

32:42.367 --> 32:44.700
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

32:44.733 --> 32:46.633
SO YOU HATE ME NOW, TOO.

32:46.667 --> 32:48.467
WELL, JOIN THE CLUB.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.200
YOU AND O'MALLEY?

32:50.233 --> 32:51.300
O'MALLEY!

32:51.333 --> 32:55.100
WHAT? WHAT IS IT THAT I DID
THAT IS SO HORRIFYING?

32:55.133 --> 32:57.633
I FELL IN LOVE, ALEX.

32:57.667 --> 33:00.233
HE'S MARRIED.
YEAH, SO?

33:00.267 --> 33:02.467
YOU'RE CARRYING
A BIG OL' TORCH FOR AVA

33:02.500 --> 33:04.400
OR JANE DOE OR WHATEVER IT IS
THAT YOU CALL HER,

33:04.433 --> 33:05.667
AND SHE'S MARRIED.

33:05.700 --> 33:08.700
SO WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT
TO JUDGE WHAT I DO?

33:08.733 --> 33:10.367
WHY DO YOU EVEN CARE?

33:10.400 --> 33:13.133
(scoffs) YOU TOLD ME
YOU WEREN'T READY YET--

33:13.167 --> 33:15.500
AFTER DENNY--
TO BE WITH ANYONE.

33:15.533 --> 33:17.167
AND THEN O'MALLEY?

33:17.200 --> 33:19.200
O'MALLEY.

33:19.233 --> 33:20.700
AND THEN YOU TELL ME

33:20.733 --> 33:22.633
LIKE I'M ONE OF YOUR
CHICK FRIENDS.

33:22.667 --> 33:24.633
COME ON.

33:30.100 --> 33:33.533
MS. BITZER, I JUST WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE ONE MORE TIME.

33:33.567 --> 33:36.567
OH, AND I JUST WANTED TO SAY
THANK YOU, DR. GREY.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.500
AND, YOU, TOO, DR. SHALES.

33:38.533 --> 33:41.300
BLESS YOU. BYE-BYE.

33:41.333 --> 33:44.100
SHE'S NOT GOING TO SUE?
NOPE.

33:44.133 --> 33:46.033
OUR LAWYER TALKED HER
INTO SETTLING.

33:46.067 --> 33:47.800
SEATTLE GRACE JUST BOUGHT
THAT WOMAN FOUR BEDROOMS

33:47.833 --> 33:50.700
AND THREE AND A HALF BATHS
IN REYKJAVíK.

33:50.733 --> 33:52.467
I'M SO SORRY.
WELL, DON'T TELL ME.

33:52.500 --> 33:55.467
TELL THE CHIEF.
I'M WRITING YOU BOTH UP.
IT WASN'T NORMAN'S FAULT.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.200
HE'S MY RESPONSIBILITY.
I'M THE RESIDENT.

33:58.233 --> 34:00.233
I'M THE ONLY ONE
YOU SHOULD WRITE UP.

34:00.267 --> 34:02.167
THAT'S VERY NOBLE OF YOU,
DR. GREY.

34:02.200 --> 34:04.467
STUPID... BUT NOBLE.

34:04.500 --> 34:07.800
OH.

34:07.833 --> 34:09.167
FOR THE RECORD,
DR. GREY,

34:09.200 --> 34:11.167
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE STUPID AT ALL.

34:11.200 --> 34:14.233
I FIND YOU...
QUITE SMART.

34:23.600 --> 34:26.067
WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO CAMILLE?

34:26.100 --> 34:27.333
ADELE--

34:27.367 --> 34:29.300
I'VE ALREADY LOST ONE BABY.

34:29.333 --> 34:32.167
AND NOW
I HAVE TO LOSE CAMILLE?

34:32.200 --> 34:34.100
I AM NOT
GOING TO USE CAMILLE

34:34.133 --> 34:36.033
TO TRY
AND MAKE UP FOR THE FACT

34:36.067 --> 34:37.800
THAT I NEVER
GAVE YOU CHILDREN.

34:37.833 --> 34:38.867
I NEVER ASKED YOU TO.

34:38.900 --> 34:42.067
I ASKED YOU TO TALK TO HER,
TO CONVINCE HER TO--

34:42.100 --> 34:44.467
I CAN'T DO THAT...

34:44.500 --> 34:47.400
I CAN'T DO THAT, ADELE.

34:47.433 --> 34:50.300
I CAN GIVE HER ALL THE OPTIONS
IN THE WORLD,

34:50.333 --> 34:54.133
BUT I CANNOT MAKE HER DO
WHAT I WANT HER TO DO.

34:54.167 --> 34:56.633
I'M HER DOCTOR.

34:56.667 --> 35:00.633
I THOUGHT BEING A DOCTOR
WAS ABOUT SAVING LIVES.

35:00.667 --> 35:02.633
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS

35:02.667 --> 35:04.733
OF CHOOSING YOUR JOB
OVER YOUR FAMILY,

35:04.767 --> 35:07.633
THE ONE TIME I ASK YOU
TO DO YOUR JOB

35:07.667 --> 35:09.667
TO SAVE THIS FAMILY...

35:13.100 --> 35:16.533
ADELE, I'M SORRY.

35:16.567 --> 35:20.033
I'M TRULY,
TRULY SORRY, BUT...

35:20.067 --> 35:22.367
SO AM I, RICHARD.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.600
(thunder rumbling)

35:45.867 --> 35:48.067
CALLIE...

35:48.100 --> 35:50.467
YOU CAN'T...

35:50.500 --> 35:53.067
JUST FORGIVE ME.

35:53.100 --> 35:56.667
WHAT I DID TO YOU...

35:56.700 --> 35:59.500
I-IS UNFORGIVABLE.

35:59.533 --> 36:01.067
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

36:01.100 --> 36:03.367
THAT'S WHAT
"I FORGIVE YOU" MEANS.

36:03.400 --> 36:05.300
NO, SEE, I--

36:05.333 --> 36:07.233
I THINK IT MEANS
YOU DON'T FORGIVE ME.

36:07.267 --> 36:09.567
I--YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
TO TALK TO ME RIGHT NOW.

36:09.600 --> 36:12.167
I MEAN, LOOK, YOU DON'T--
YOU CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT ME.

36:12.200 --> 36:14.100
YOU'RE SO ANGRY THAT...

36:14.133 --> 36:16.833
I THINK THE ONLY WAY
YOU CAN DEAL WITH ME

36:16.867 --> 36:18.767
IS TO SAY YOU FORGIVE ME
AND...

36:18.800 --> 36:21.700
WHAT, WE PRETEND
IT DIDN'T HAPPEN?

36:25.467 --> 36:27.400
I...

36:27.433 --> 36:29.100
IT HAPPENED.

36:29.133 --> 36:32.333
AND YOU DON'T FORGIVE ME.

36:34.833 --> 36:37.633
YOU'RE RIGHT.

36:37.667 --> 36:39.700
I DON'T.

36:50.833 --> 36:52.733
SO I GOT ALEX TO COVER FOR ME.
OH.

36:52.767 --> 36:55.600
SO I CAN LEAVE RIGHT AFTER
I ROUND ON MY PATIENTS.
YEAH.

36:55.633 --> 36:58.700
48 UNINTERRUPTED HOURS--
YEAH, YEAH.
UM... YOU KNOW WHAT?

36:58.733 --> 37:00.633
MAYBE THIS IS NOT
A GOOD WEEKEND.

37:00.667 --> 37:03.167
WHAT DID LEXIE SAY
ABOUT ME?

37:03.200 --> 37:06.067
SHE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.
I DID ALL THE TALKING.

37:06.100 --> 37:08.100
LOOK, DON'T BLAME HER.

37:08.133 --> 37:10.033
SO WHAT, YOU'RE FRIENDS
WITH MY SISTER NOW?

37:10.067 --> 37:12.600
I MEAN, YOU TALK TO
THE OTHER GREY ABOUT ME?

37:12.633 --> 37:14.667
MM-HMM.

37:14.700 --> 37:18.633
YOU KNOW WHAT I TALKED ABOUT
WITH THE OTHER GREY?

37:20.500 --> 37:23.400
ALL THE THINGS
THIS GREY WON'T LET ME SAY.

37:23.433 --> 37:26.633
YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING
TO ME.

37:29.100 --> 37:31.667
I WANT TO MARRY YOU.

37:31.700 --> 37:33.133
***

37:33.167 --> 37:35.067
I WANT TO HAVE KIDS
WITH YOU.

37:35.100 --> 37:37.533
I WANT TO BUILD US A HOUSE.

37:37.567 --> 37:40.600
I WANT TO SETTLE DOWN
AND GROW OLD WITH YOU.

37:40.633 --> 37:42.533
***

37:42.567 --> 37:45.167
I WANT TO DIE
WHEN I'M 110 YEARS OLD

37:45.200 --> 37:47.367
IN YOUR ARMS.

37:47.400 --> 37:50.367
I DON'T WANT
48 UNINTERRUPTED HOURS.

37:52.167 --> 37:54.100
I WANT A LIFETIME.

37:54.133 --> 37:56.633
***

37:56.667 --> 37:58.767
MM-HMM.

38:00.067 --> 38:02.667
DO YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS?

38:02.700 --> 38:04.600
I SAY THINGS LIKE THAT,

38:04.633 --> 38:07.500
AND YOU FIGHT THE URGE TO RUN
IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION.

38:07.533 --> 38:11.233
IT'S OKAY. I UNDERSTAND.

38:11.267 --> 38:14.200
I DIDN'T,
BUT NOW I DO. I DO.

38:14.233 --> 38:16.133
YOU'RE JUST GETTING STARTED.

38:16.167 --> 38:19.200
AND I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR A LONG TIME.

38:19.233 --> 38:22.233
DEEP DOWN...

38:22.267 --> 38:24.733
YOU'RE STILL AN INTERN.

38:24.767 --> 38:26.633
AND YOU'RE NOT READY.

38:26.667 --> 38:28.833
I'M NOT READY RIGHT NOW.

38:28.867 --> 38:31.733
BUT THINGS COULD STAY
THE WAY THEY ARE...

38:31.767 --> 38:33.667
MM-HMM.
AND I CAN GET READY.

38:33.700 --> 38:36.400
I'LL GET READY.
THINGS CAN STAY
THE WAY THEY ARE.

38:36.433 --> 38:38.333
WE CAN STILL MEET
IN THE ELEVATOR

38:38.367 --> 38:40.233
OR THE ON CALL ROOM.

38:40.267 --> 38:42.300
AND MAYBE YOU'LL BE READY.

38:42.333 --> 38:44.833
AND I'LL WAIT.

38:44.867 --> 38:47.800
I'LL WAIT
UNTIL YOU'RE READY.

38:47.833 --> 38:49.467
OKAY, THEN.

38:49.500 --> 38:50.700
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF...

38:50.733 --> 38:53.367
WHAT IF WHILE I'M WAITING

38:53.400 --> 38:56.533
I MEET SOMEONE WHO IS READY
TO GIVE ME WHAT I WANT FROM YOU?

38:56.567 --> 38:59.133
WHAT IF YOU DO?

38:59.167 --> 39:00.367
(elevator bell dings)

39:00.400 --> 39:03.533
***

39:03.567 --> 39:05.267
I DON'T KNOW.

39:05.300 --> 39:08.433
***

39:12.800 --> 39:15.600
FORGIVE AND FORGET.

39:15.633 --> 39:17.533
***

39:17.567 --> 39:19.600
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAY.

39:19.633 --> 39:22.633
***

39:22.667 --> 39:25.367
I JUST WANTED TO SAY, UM,

39:25.400 --> 39:27.167
THANK YOU FOR...

39:27.200 --> 39:29.300
SAVING MY ASS TODAY
IN SURGERY.

39:29.333 --> 39:31.267
WELL, THAT'S MY JOB, THREE.

39:31.300 --> 39:33.200
NOW WHERE ARE ADAM'S
POST-OP LABS?

39:33.233 --> 39:36.167
IT'S GOOD ADVICE,
BUT IT'S NOT VERY PRACTICAL.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.733
I'LL GET THEM, DR. YANG.

39:38.767 --> 39:41.633
***

39:41.667 --> 39:44.533
(crying)

39:44.567 --> 39:47.433
***

39:47.467 --> 39:49.100
WHEN SOMEONE HURTS US...

39:49.133 --> 39:51.200
(knock on door)

39:51.233 --> 39:53.133
WE WANT TO HURT THEM BACK.

39:53.167 --> 39:56.133
COME IN.

39:56.167 --> 40:00.167
***

40:03.800 --> 40:06.300
KEEP IT DOWN, WILL YOU?

40:06.333 --> 40:08.300
WHEN SOMEONE WRONGS US,

40:08.333 --> 40:11.133
WE WANT TO BE RIGHT.

40:11.167 --> 40:15.333
WITHOUT FORGIVENESS,
OLD SCORES ARE NEVER SETTLED...

40:15.367 --> 40:18.400
OLD WOUNDS NEVER HEAL.

40:18.433 --> 40:20.333
***

40:20.367 --> 40:23.233
AND THE MOST WE CAN HOPE FOR
IS THAT ONE DAY

40:23.267 --> 40:26.400
WE'LL BE LUCKY ENOUGH
TO FORGET.

40:26.433 --> 40:29.600
***
