Previously on "Billions"...

00:10.144 --> 00:12.580
When did it become a crime
to succeed in this country?

00:12.580 --> 00:14.382
[Bobby] Everyone has access
to the information.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.083
We just know
how to analyze it better.

00:16.083 --> 00:19.387
Suspect trading pattern
on Pepsum Pharmaceuticals.

00:19.387 --> 00:20.688
They had
inside information.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.456
You must get pings like that
every day.

00:22.456 --> 00:23.691
It's bigger than that.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.427
[Spyros] All three firms
have links to Bobby Axelrod.

00:26.427 --> 00:27.561
This would be a big one.

00:27.561 --> 00:31.031
But a good matador doesn't try
to kill a fresh bull.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.768
You wait until he's been stuck
a few times.

00:33.768 --> 00:35.803
Why aren't you prosecuting
the investment banks

00:35.803 --> 00:38.105
and hedge funds
for insider trading?

00:38.105 --> 00:40.541
Go ask the 81 convicted felons
of financial crimes

00:40.541 --> 00:42.243
currently serving time.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.245
But you have a very specific
conflict of interest

00:44.245 --> 00:45.179
right in your own home.

00:45.179 --> 00:47.281
Your value to the firm
is absolute.

00:47.281 --> 00:49.517
I've been working there
since before we were married

00:49.517 --> 00:51.185
and long before
you were in office.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.453
I work
for the public good.

00:52.453 --> 00:54.755
No, you work for the good
of Chuck Rhoades.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.057
Maybe sometimes
they intersect.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.492
You know the Norton place
out at the beach?

00:58.492 --> 00:59.593
[Sacker] I just heard

00:59.593 --> 01:00.761
Bobby Axelrod
is trying to buy it.

01:00.761 --> 01:02.329
[Bryan] How much?
[Sacker] $83 million.

01:02.329 --> 01:04.432
People hate guys
who buy things like that.

01:04.432 --> 01:07.067
[Hall] You said there was only
one thing you were afraid of --

01:07.067 --> 01:09.069
guys in windbreakers
walking in your office

01:09.069 --> 01:11.272
saying, "Step away
from the computer."

01:11.272 --> 01:13.507
And you told me you'd make sure
it wouldn't happen.

01:13.507 --> 01:14.542
So let me make sure.

01:14.542 --> 01:15.576
[Bobby] Steven Birch?

01:15.576 --> 01:16.644
[Hall]
It's either him or you.

01:16.644 --> 01:17.611
Piedmont Capital.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.113
Yeah.

01:19.113 --> 01:21.348
That swap deal he did
on Arcadian Railroad --

01:21.348 --> 01:23.417
Do an autopsy on the deal,

01:23.417 --> 01:25.519
you'll find yourself
a Pulitzer in the carcass.

01:27.121 --> 01:28.789
Front fucking page
of the Post.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.225
[Bryan] It's like
he's daring you.

01:31.225 --> 01:32.860
[Hall]
There's movement.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.663
It's likely they've opened
a case file on you.

01:35.663 --> 01:37.164
You know what?

01:37.164 --> 01:38.265
I'm ready.

[Nick Waterhouse's
"High Tiding" plays]

01:58.452 --> 02:01.288
No, Pete, the gold standard
is never  coming back.

02:01.288 --> 02:03.190
And if it did,
this world would be so fucked,

02:03.190 --> 02:05.526
I'd buy space travel,
not gold.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.228
Nice pitch, though.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.462
If I'd have known
it was a gold play,

02:08.462 --> 02:09.663
I'd have never
put him through.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.198
Always  put that lunatic
through.

02:11.198 --> 02:14.435
One out of every 200 ideas
he has is fucking brilliant.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.337
[knocks]
I got this.

02:20.574 --> 02:21.876
Bad idea.

02:21.876 --> 02:24.745
"No man is a hero
to his valet."

02:24.745 --> 02:26.146
That goes double
for his C.O.O.,

02:26.146 --> 02:27.481
so you are fucked with me
either way.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.616
[scoffs]

02:28.616 --> 02:30.751
[Wags] Let's take a car
to the city instead of flying.

02:30.751 --> 02:32.887
What's underneath this?

02:32.887 --> 02:35.723
Look, if the U.S. Attorney
is  really coming,

02:35.723 --> 02:39.260
maybe it's better if we don't
make you more of a target.

02:39.260 --> 02:42.396
And more important,
Garth Sykes from Flagship.

02:42.396 --> 02:44.698
Hated seeing you
on the cover of the Post

02:44.698 --> 02:46.767
with that goddamned
oceanfront mansion.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.869
Teachers in that pension fund
make 40 grand a year.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.404
People who have it
spend it.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.539
People who don't have it

02:51.539 --> 02:53.774
like billies better
who spend on other folks.

02:53.774 --> 02:54.775
Charity, good works.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.844
I do, I have,
and you know it.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.413
Today, they only remember
the house.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.282
I have a feeling
there'll be another one of us

03:01.282 --> 03:02.416
on the front pages
soon enough,

03:02.416 --> 03:03.651
and they'll forget
about that.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.853
But if Flagship
does try and withdraw...

03:05.853 --> 03:07.555
We can't let him.

03:07.555 --> 03:10.958
If Flagship pulls its
$1.5 billion, it gets public.

03:10.958 --> 03:12.960
Other institutions go, too.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.361
Whole thing could domino.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.963
Get with Sykes,
keep them onboard.

03:15.963 --> 03:17.531
That's just
why I'm telling you

03:17.531 --> 03:18.933
to keep it
a little more low-key.

03:45.759 --> 03:50.431
So, the key
to bagging Axe is...?

03:50.431 --> 03:51.899
Pete Decker.
Oh.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.233
His fund. Has to be.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.368
[Bryan]
We start with Decker

03:54.368 --> 03:55.836
since he had the longest tenure
at Axe Capital

03:55.836 --> 03:58.439
of anyone who left
with Axe's backing.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.708
Get me some more of those
cold sesame noodles, would you?

04:00.708 --> 04:03.243
No, these are --
these are dandan noodles.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.446

No. No, one's Szechuan,
the other Taiwanese.

04:07.348 --> 04:08.482
It's a whole thing.

04:08.482 --> 04:10.684
You know, this is why
I don't mind the hours.

04:10.684 --> 04:13.387
I'm always learning something
on the job. It's incredible.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.989
Yeah, tell him
about General Tso's, Bryan.

04:14.989 --> 04:16.824
Oh, no, he flings this shit
at you,  too?

04:16.824 --> 04:18.292
Sprays it all around.

04:18.292 --> 04:19.927

you've ever been is Asia,

04:19.927 --> 04:21.695
you can't help yourself.

04:21.695 --> 04:24.598
[Sacker] Here -- indictments
on that Ponzi thing.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.500
Tell me about the General,
Bryan. Come on.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.735
[Sacker] Well,
now you've done it.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.536
[laughs]

04:29.536 --> 04:32.673
General Tso, he was
a statesman in the Qing Dynasty.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.375
Suppressed a revolution.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.410
Oh, and now
he has the true glory.

04:36.410 --> 04:39.279
A fried chicken dish named
for him the world over, huh?

04:39.279 --> 04:40.447
That was created
in America.

04:40.447 --> 04:43.417
Maybe after we nail Axe,
they'll reciprocate --

04:43.417 --> 04:45.052
name a dish after you
in China, huh?

04:45.052 --> 04:47.321
Oh-ho. General Chuck's?
[Sacker laughs]

04:47.321 --> 04:48.989
Really, what would that --
what would that look like,

cooked on the inside?

04:50.591 --> 04:51.792

04:51.792 --> 04:54.862
You really think I could ever
be that richly honored?

04:54.862 --> 04:56.730
Hey, I will make it so.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.599
Not if we're still stuck.

04:58.599 --> 04:59.667
We need to find a way

04:59.667 --> 05:02.603
to get Pete Decker
on the hook, right?

05:02.603 --> 05:06.373
Decker hires young, and he pays
at the top of the range.

05:06.373 --> 05:08.542
Now, once these guys get a taste
for that kind of money,

05:08.542 --> 05:10.077
they get desperate
to keep it going.

05:10.077 --> 05:12.312
Start tracking all of his
analysts and traders.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.948

we're right there.

Mm. Yeah.
They weren't that kind of nun.

like Dick Cheney.

that's going on here tonight.

Can't.
It mars everything.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.456
The name up there
should mean something.

05:55.456 --> 05:58.125
Should add --
add to the luster of the place.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.593
Just don't look.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.462
I like the building.

Good question.

They're
about to pass the hat.

What?
What do you have?

07:37.491 --> 07:38.926
[Kornbluth] Birch made
a big play in the railroad --

07:38.926 --> 07:41.128
captured 43%
before good numbers,

07:41.128 --> 07:43.664
and expansion plans
were announced

07:43.664 --> 07:44.798
with inside information.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.066

for comment on Steven Birch.

08:15.696 --> 08:16.930
What about him?

08:16.930 --> 08:18.098
They're running a story

08:18.098 --> 08:19.867
that he made illegal trades
on Arcadian Railroad

08:19.867 --> 08:21.869

is incontrovertible.

how could the paper have that

Ah, fuck the firm --

08:49.596 --> 08:52.633
There's a reason
you retained me -- me.

And that is...

down the road

08:59.673 --> 09:01.041
What do you see?

09:01.041 --> 09:04.177
U.S. Attorney
needs to bag you.

09:04.177 --> 09:06.313
Rhoades could bring it quick
or take two years.

09:06.313 --> 09:07.915
Two years?

09:07.915 --> 09:09.249
[Orrin] Then it becomes
a three-front war --

09:09.249 --> 09:11.685
P.R., redemptions,
and the government.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.888
It's not too early to start a
makeover of the firm's culture.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.223
What fucking culture?

09:16.223 --> 09:17.991
Big returns that beat
the street by double digits

09:17.991 --> 09:19.893
year in, year out,
making our investors rich?

09:19.893 --> 09:21.995
That culture?
No -- the rep.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.932
Smart money --
maybe a little too  smart.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.034
If they bring an action,

09:27.034 --> 09:29.569
the whole strategy becomes
about leveraging a settlement --

09:29.569 --> 09:31.705
a deferred prosecution agreement
and forfeiture

09:31.705 --> 09:32.873
that lets you
keep working.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.107
And the best way
to get that

09:34.107 --> 09:36.710
is to act
like you'd never settle.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.078
I'd never settle.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.847
That's the public posture,
for sure.

09:40.847 --> 09:43.116
I'd never settle.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.819
Yeah. That's a good delivery.
That'll work.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.254
[applause]

09:47.254 --> 09:49.589
[Penn] Thank you! Good evening!
I'm gonna go find my table.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.693
[Penn] Thank you.
How you doing?

09:52.693 --> 09:55.028
My name is Penn Jillette
of Penn and Teller,

09:55.028 --> 09:58.365
and we're gonna give
as much money as we can.

09:58.365 --> 10:00.100
I will hurt myself,

10:00.100 --> 10:02.636
then you will hurt yourself
with money.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.104
Gonna look like this.

10:04.104 --> 10:07.341
[applause]

10:12.846 --> 10:14.982
Think about how much that hurts

10:14.982 --> 10:17.384
and think about
how good you would feel

10:17.384 --> 10:19.086
if you gave a million dollars.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.787
Who's giving a million dollars?
Stand up.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.122
Come on!
A million dollars!

10:22.122 --> 10:24.925
Starting at a stick.
Fuck it.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.928
[Penn] $1 million!

10:27.928 --> 10:29.262
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.900
Oh!
You're a good man!

10:33.900 --> 10:36.136
No better than you.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.274
[Penn] Wonderful. Wonderful.
That's good.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.377
Who are the cheapskates
giving a half a million?

10:43.377 --> 10:44.244
Come on!

10:44.244 --> 10:46.380
Come on.
Half a million up there.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.182
Get the fuck up,

10:49.182 --> 10:51.184
or people will think
I'm not paying you enough.

10:52.686 --> 10:53.887
[applause]

10:53.887 --> 10:57.057
[cellphone chimes, buzzes]

10:57.057 --> 10:58.158
[Penn]
Can I see $250,000?

10:58.158 --> 11:00.394
I'll get everybody
standing up eventually.

11:00.394 --> 11:02.996
They will not let Teller go
unless everybody stands up.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.732
How about $250,000
over here?

11:05.732 --> 11:07.234
Holy shit.

11:07.234 --> 11:09.903
Financial Journal
just pasted Birch.

11:09.903 --> 11:12.439
[cellphone chimes]

11:13.907 --> 11:15.809
[Penn]
100 grand -- stand up.

11:15.809 --> 11:18.045
[applause]

11:18.045 --> 11:20.180
â™ªslow musicâ™ª

11:27.954 --> 11:29.222
[Penn] Anybody else?

11:29.222 --> 11:31.792
Anybody making $50,000?
How about $25,000?

11:31.792 --> 11:34.261
He's gonna want
that million back.

11:37.130 --> 11:39.466
We need to go.

11:39.466 --> 11:42.235
[Penn] Everybody  should be
standing up at this point!

11:54.915 --> 11:57.017
Hey. You need a minute
before we --

11:57.017 --> 11:58.085
For what?

11:58.085 --> 12:00.020
Pump-up sesh
for the morning meeting,

12:00.020 --> 12:01.488
like every week.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.123
Not happening.

12:03.123 --> 12:06.259
Oh, what the fuck, Wend?
I count on it.

12:06.259 --> 12:08.128
It's how I get in there
and deal with those animals.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.397
Canceled
until further notice.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.866
You don't need it --
not anymore.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.801
You're the best P.M.
on the floor.

12:14.801 --> 12:16.736
You know it.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.004
They're
fucking sure of it.

12:18.004 --> 12:20.240
Those animals are used to you
putting them down now.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.375
[Wendy] Hardly even whimper
as it happens.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.145
Our sesh, while fun,
is a waste of your time.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.513
And  mine.

12:26.513 --> 12:27.781
Go get 'em!

12:29.249 --> 12:31.084
Fuckin' A.

12:34.321 --> 12:35.388
[laughs]

12:35.388 --> 12:37.524
You just did it,
didn't you?

12:42.095 --> 12:43.330
All right.

12:43.330 --> 12:44.798
3 feet apart,
all right?

12:44.798 --> 12:46.066
Tres,  all right?

12:46.066 --> 12:48.935
And mucha agua
en la maÃ±ana.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.104
Can you tell him no food and
lots of water in the morning?

12:51.104 --> 12:52.973
He knows.
Does he? Yeah?

12:52.973 --> 12:55.208
'Cause I don't feel like
I'm getting much back from him.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.943
I know you  get it.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.845
You know Lu wants to do
zucchini flowers on special

12:58.845 --> 12:59.980
now that
the frost is gone,

12:59.980 --> 13:01.548
so let's be ready
when they come in.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.949
You got it, boss.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.251
[Mike] All right,
ladies and gentlemen.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.219
We are up 32%
year-to-date,

13:06.219 --> 13:09.089
and we are open
to all  moneymaking ideas.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.558
Longs, shorts,
sells, covers --

13:11.558 --> 13:13.193
all Alpha welcome.

13:13.193 --> 13:16.863
The choppy waters out there
are perfect -- for us.

13:16.863 --> 13:19.533
For the average investor,
hell no.

13:19.533 --> 13:21.134
But never forget --

13:21.134 --> 13:23.537
what's bad for him
is good for us.

13:23.537 --> 13:28.108
If -- If  we're as smart
as we think we are.

13:28.108 --> 13:31.811
If not, the heat'll melt us
like an Almond Joy in the sun.

13:31.811 --> 13:32.812
[laughter]

13:32.812 --> 13:35.815
So, are you smart enough?

13:35.815 --> 13:37.184
Some of us
fuckin' are.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.152
[laughter]

13:39.152 --> 13:40.153
How about you, Pouch?

13:41.354 --> 13:43.423
How am I
supposed to answer that?

13:43.423 --> 13:45.025
You already have.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.526
Sadly.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.562
What happened
on Eureka Trans-ship?

13:48.562 --> 13:50.397
You knew they were gonna
whiff their numbers.

13:50.397 --> 13:51.565
Why didn't you
bang the short harder?

13:51.565 --> 13:53.567
You left five fucking percent
on the table.

13:53.567 --> 13:56.603
I thought they were gonna whiff,
but I didn't know.

13:56.603 --> 13:59.105
You are such a pussy
on the short side.

13:59.105 --> 14:00.607
[laughter]

14:00.607 --> 14:02.175
Go home and get
your fuckin' shinebox.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.210
Insulted him
a little bit.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.344
Yeah, a little bit.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.879
Axe,
you saw my position.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.147
You could have upped him.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.548
That's what
I'm paying you  for.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.951
You see an opportunity
like that again, you grab it

14:10.951 --> 14:13.153
like it's a horse cock
and you're Catherine the Great.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.454
[laughter]

14:14.454 --> 14:16.089
Okay, okay.

14:16.089 --> 14:20.160
Saldana, why are we still
tied up in those hospitals?

14:20.160 --> 14:21.461
Baby Boomers.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.463
They're getting old,
so they're getting sick.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.232
When the group reports
patient volumes,

14:25.232 --> 14:27.100
it's gonna overshoot
street expectations.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.102
[Saldana]
We're talking 10% move.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.404
That incremental revenue will
drop right to the bottom line,

14:31.404 --> 14:34.474
and the stock's gonna pop
like a prom queen's cherry.

14:34.474 --> 14:35.442
[laughter]

14:35.442 --> 14:37.410
Good fucking answer.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.145
It really is.
God damn it.

14:39.145 --> 14:41.014
Okay, new-idea time.

14:41.014 --> 14:43.116
[man clears throat]

14:43.116 --> 14:45.318
Donnie Caan,
what do you have for us?

14:46.953 --> 14:48.188
I think Apple

14:48.188 --> 14:50.423
still has room
to move north.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.158
Really?

14:53.159 --> 14:56.029
Our investors pay us
a 3% management fee

14:56.029 --> 14:57.664
and 30% of their profits,

14:57.664 --> 15:00.900
and you want me to tell them
we're buying some fucking Apple?

15:02.102 --> 15:03.203
Sorry, Axe.

15:03.203 --> 15:07.107
I-I guess I'm just not
seeing the matrix right now.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.042
[Mike] That's a little
unsettling, Donnie --

15:09.042 --> 15:11.544
since seeing the matrix
is your entire fucking job.

15:11.544 --> 15:12.912
[Mike] It's kind of like
if you were a hurdler

15:12.912 --> 15:15.315
and instead of jumping
over the fucking hurdles --

15:15.315 --> 15:17.250
It's okay, Donnie.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.451
You'll see it again.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.552
Hang in.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.322
[Bobby] Okay, guys?

15:22.322 --> 15:24.257
Let's go out there,
bring some meat back to camp.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.659
Or some nuts.

15:25.659 --> 15:27.260
Hunt or  gather.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.962
[indistinct conversations]

15:30.930 --> 15:33.366
I'm sorry. I tried to give you
the heads-up, but...

15:37.103 --> 15:39.306
[Steve] Phones down.

15:39.306 --> 15:41.508
We're S.E.C. Compliance.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.510
I need all portfolio managers
and analysts

15:43.510 --> 15:45.245
to return to their desks.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.013
[Steve] Traders, stay here.

15:47.013 --> 15:49.516
Case officers will meet each pod

15:49.516 --> 15:52.719
and expect full cooperation.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.324
Better answer
their questions.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.658
Cooperate.

15:59.993 --> 16:01.561
This group
of energy trades --

16:01.561 --> 16:03.563
I'd like you to supply
the research behind them.

16:03.563 --> 16:06.099
I was tasked,
so I supplied it.

16:06.099 --> 16:08.301
Right, but going through
your reports, I see gaps.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.604
Like this Boardwalk Pipeline
move -- what supported it?

16:11.604 --> 16:13.440
It was
an event-driven strategy.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.644
Okay, it was based
on an unsolicited tip.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.347
The trade
was near 100,000 shares.

16:20.347 --> 16:25.051
Close to a $2.5 million position
based on a rumor.

16:25.051 --> 16:27.053
It seemed...

16:27.053 --> 16:29.189
solid.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.725
Looking at tele-comm --
this Verizon trade?

16:31.725 --> 16:34.394
It's part
of an event-driven macroplay.

16:34.394 --> 16:35.662
Bullshit.

16:37.364 --> 16:38.598
All right,
I got a tip.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.400
And the pharmaceutical
trades?

16:40.400 --> 16:42.068
That was phone-a-tip.

16:42.068 --> 16:44.504
Incoming tip.
What am I, a fucking schmuck?

16:44.504 --> 16:45.739
Of course
I'm gonna listen.

16:45.739 --> 16:48.575
That was
a prom-night promise.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.243
And that means...?

16:50.243 --> 16:51.678
"Just the tip."

16:52.645 --> 16:55.148
So, this is your entire
book and trading history

16:55.148 --> 16:56.516
for the past
three months?

16:56.516 --> 16:58.051
That's right.

16:58.051 --> 16:59.085
Wow.

16:59.085 --> 17:00.520
Bit of a rough patch,
huh?

17:00.520 --> 17:03.390
Seriously?

17:03.390 --> 17:05.792
Gonna need to see your trades
for the past 90 days.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.660
Unless you got a Wells notice
with my name on it,

17:07.660 --> 17:09.129
you're not gonna see
jack shit.

17:09.129 --> 17:11.164
Come on, we can pull it all
down from the server anyway,

17:11.164 --> 17:12.532
so you may as well
cooperate.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.434
Mm. Good point.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.402
Lawyer.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.270
Your boss said
you should cooperate.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.239
Oh. Lawyer.

17:19.239 --> 17:20.673
Just answer the question.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.410
You answer me  one.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.211
How much do you make?

17:25.211 --> 17:27.113
[knock on door]

17:27.747 --> 17:29.115
I'm gonna need access

17:29.115 --> 17:31.251
to your files, paper,
and computer.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.419
For what?

17:32.419 --> 17:34.220
I'm authorized to check
that all trades comply --

17:34.220 --> 17:35.355
I'm not a trader.

17:35.355 --> 17:37.624
Whatever you call yourself,
after I review --

17:37.624 --> 17:40.493
My files are confidential.
You're not seeing them.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.595
You can call the
Attorney General if you want,

17:42.595 --> 17:44.597
and tell her I say "hi"
if you do.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.199
We had dinner
last month.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.334
Otherwise, fuck off.

17:48.334 --> 17:49.469
[door slams]

17:49.469 --> 17:51.371
â™ªdramatic musicâ™ª

17:59.078 --> 18:01.614
Enough. Okay?
Enough.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.850
[claps]

18:03.850 --> 18:06.252
I hope you enjoyed
the lifeboat drill this morning.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.620
[man]
Are you kidding me?

18:07.620 --> 18:09.389
[Bobby]
We did not do well.

18:09.389 --> 18:12.091
In fact, we sank.

18:12.091 --> 18:15.161
If it were a real  S.E.C. raid,
we would have been fucked.

18:15.161 --> 18:17.330
Get the fuck out of here.
[scoffs]

18:17.330 --> 18:18.765
I shit my pants
for nothing?

18:18.765 --> 18:20.800
I didn't do this
for my amusement.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.802
What happened
to Steven Birch --

18:22.802 --> 18:25.872
Who I am sure will be cleared
of any wrongdoing --

18:25.872 --> 18:27.273
It could happen to us.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.809
So we need to be prepared.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.411
To that end, say "hello"

18:31.411 --> 18:34.280
to our new and improved
Compliance Department.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.149
[Bill] These assholes
work here now?

18:36.149 --> 18:37.550
That, they do.

18:37.550 --> 18:40.820
They're here for our support
and our protection,

18:40.820 --> 18:42.655
and you will not
even be taking a piss

18:42.655 --> 18:45.625
without them close enough
to give it a shake.

18:45.625 --> 18:49.462
From here on,
we evaluate every move --

18:49.462 --> 18:52.198
not just for the upside,
but for its ethical grounding.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.199
We have to be more pure

18:53.199 --> 18:55.435
than the Virgin Mary
before her first period.

18:55.435 --> 18:57.537
Fuck, Wags.

18:57.537 --> 19:01.441
How the hell are we
supposed to make any money?

19:01.441 --> 19:03.343
You think this is a joke,
Victor?

19:05.245 --> 19:07.480
You, in particular,
were flagged.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.848
Flagged?

19:08.848 --> 19:11.885
Your short
on that chip maker.

19:11.885 --> 19:13.887
Eleva Peripherals.

19:13.887 --> 19:18.157
Netted 38% fresh blubber
on that seal hunt.

19:18.157 --> 19:21.361
[Bobby] Rotten carcass --
over the line.

19:21.361 --> 19:24.631
We're lucky the S.E.C.
hasn't come calling already.

19:24.631 --> 19:25.765
You're done.

19:25.765 --> 19:27.367
[Bobby] Fired.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.903
Clear out.

19:29.903 --> 19:31.804
Leave your key cards.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.247
This is bullshit.

19:41.247 --> 19:42.549
I didn't do anything
out-of-bounds --

19:42.549 --> 19:44.183
no more
than anyone else.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.518
Did I sign off
on that trade?

19:45.518 --> 19:46.819
No, I did not.

19:46.819 --> 19:48.688
Don't say anything else.

19:48.688 --> 19:52.325
I trusted you
with my name and my capital,

19:52.325 --> 19:53.693
and you fucked me.

19:53.693 --> 19:56.296
[Bobby]
You put us all at risk

19:56.296 --> 19:58.331
with your deceitful,
illegal moves.

19:58.331 --> 20:00.366
Now get out of here.

20:00.366 --> 20:02.468
â™ªsuspenseful musicâ™ª

20:09.342 --> 20:11.444
All right, everybody,
back at it.

20:11.444 --> 20:14.614
Play hard, play clean.

20:14.614 --> 20:17.483
Be careful out there.

20:17.483 --> 20:18.952
That was
a hell of a public spanking.

20:18.952 --> 20:20.620
Make sure our investors
know about it.

20:20.620 --> 20:21.754
On it.

20:21.754 --> 20:24.324
I'm gonna make sure Garth Sykes
hears about it A.S.A.P.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.359
You're gonna be a god
on the street by lunchtime.

20:26.359 --> 20:27.694
I thought
I already was  one.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.395
Greater god.
[scoffs]

20:31.297 --> 20:33.900
Don't you fuckin' touch me!

20:33.900 --> 20:35.401
Or my cellphone.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.539
[door opens, closes]

20:50.516 --> 20:53.519
I was going to tell you
about the compliance gag,

20:53.519 --> 20:55.922
but you didn't show up
at the charity dinner,

20:55.922 --> 20:57.023
and then...

20:57.023 --> 21:00.493
Then...I was half a hallway
from your office.

21:00.493 --> 21:01.961
Try again.

21:01.961 --> 21:04.430
Honest?
It was an oversight.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.965
No, it wasn't.
You don't make them.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.533
And that matters.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.902
But what matters more
right now is that Victor

21:09.902 --> 21:12.739
is exactly the wrong person
to fire that way.

21:12.739 --> 21:13.973
That was
spur-of-the-moment.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.309
It was a spur-of-the-moment
fuck-up.

21:17.310 --> 21:19.345
His entire
psychological makeup

21:19.345 --> 21:21.314
sets him up
to react very poorly

21:21.314 --> 21:22.715
to public humiliation.

21:22.715 --> 21:25.518
The same things that made him
a profit center for you

21:25.518 --> 21:27.453
will make him
a difficult adversary

21:27.453 --> 21:28.721
if he's not handled right.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.456
He will stew and obsess

21:30.456 --> 21:32.659
and find a way
to exact revenge on you.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.528
Okay.
I can see that.

21:35.528 --> 21:36.663
Will you fix it?

21:39.932 --> 21:42.468
Go do it, please.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.570
I made a mistake
not looping you in.

21:44.570 --> 21:45.705
I admit that.

21:45.705 --> 21:47.840
"Mistake."

21:47.840 --> 21:49.442
Last chance.

21:50.443 --> 21:52.011
Okay.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.780
It was a red team drill.

21:53.780 --> 21:56.649
I wanted everybody to react
as they would naturally.

21:59.619 --> 22:01.587
I left you out
on purpose.

22:04.490 --> 22:06.325
And I will
make it up to you.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.794
Please deal with Victor.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.970
Sean Ayles, please.
It's Lara Axelrod.

22:19.439 --> 22:20.707
Sean. Hi.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.075
This is the call
you've been waiting for.

22:22.075 --> 22:24.811
I wanted to talk to you
about making a donation.

22:24.811 --> 22:25.978
[chuckles]

22:25.978 --> 22:28.114
I figured you would.

22:28.114 --> 22:30.883
And about naming rights.

22:30.883 --> 22:33.886
[Sean] And so
the names on these buildings

22:33.886 --> 22:36.656
become more
than just identifiers.

22:36.656 --> 22:41.394
They become signifiers
of a grander age,

22:41.394 --> 22:43.629
when titans of industry
understood

22:43.629 --> 22:45.565
that the purpose
of their wealth

22:45.565 --> 22:47.600
was to support
the performative arts

22:47.600 --> 22:49.368
to improve
the quality of life

22:49.368 --> 22:52.872
for all those who live in
and visit this city.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.008
Now give me
the Gettysburg Address.

22:56.008 --> 22:57.543
I'm sorry.

22:57.543 --> 23:00.046
That...
sounded rehearsed.

23:01.681 --> 23:02.682
I'm vamping.

23:02.682 --> 23:03.983
[clears throat]

23:03.983 --> 23:05.084
I'm in a difficult spot.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.652
No, yeah, I know.

23:06.652 --> 23:10.590
Because what you need to tell me
is that the Eads family

23:10.590 --> 23:14.460
owns the naming rights
to this building in perpetuity.

23:14.460 --> 23:17.396
But I'm here
offering you $100 million,

23:17.396 --> 23:19.732
which you need to extract
somehow

23:19.732 --> 23:21.801
without giving me
what I want.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.438
I'm in a difficult spot.

23:25.438 --> 23:27.406
No, yeah, I know.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.610
Also, "performative"
does not mean "performance."

23:32.178 --> 23:34.080
Most donors
like an air of --

23:34.080 --> 23:35.481
I don't.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.118
There are other naming
opportunities on the ground

23:39.118 --> 23:41.854
that would give you the status
and sense of permanence

23:41.854 --> 23:42.889
that you need.

23:42.889 --> 23:45.491
Why is this building
so important to you?

23:46.926 --> 23:49.762
Here's why
it's important to you.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.799
It's the only way you are
getting even a dollar out of me.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.600
[Bobby] Now, I happen
to have discovered

23:54.600 --> 23:56.602
that the remaining members
of the Eads family

23:56.602 --> 23:58.604
are in a financial pinch.

23:58.604 --> 24:00.540
They need to raise cash.

24:00.540 --> 24:01.841
And they will have
a hard time

24:01.841 --> 24:03.609
getting ahold
of the kind of loan they need

24:03.609 --> 24:05.545
to pay off
their other loans.

24:05.545 --> 24:07.113
So, I want you
to tell them

24:07.113 --> 24:09.749
that I will pay them
$25 million

24:09.749 --> 24:13.452
to allow me to replace
their family name

24:13.452 --> 24:15.454
with mine.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.757
Then I will donate
the 100,

24:17.757 --> 24:20.226
and you can begin
your renovations.

24:20.226 --> 24:22.195
â™ªpensive musicâ™ª

24:26.499 --> 24:27.800
Oh.

24:29.902 --> 24:33.239
There is one condition
I'll need you to sign off on.

24:36.709 --> 24:39.245
[keys jingling]

24:39.245 --> 24:40.479
[gasps]

24:40.479 --> 24:42.148
Don't scream.

24:42.148 --> 24:43.983
Look there.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.485
[ moaning  ]

24:46.485 --> 24:48.888
What the fuck?

24:48.888 --> 24:50.022
Get out.

24:50.022 --> 24:51.190
I'm calling the police.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.959
You don't want
to do that, Tara.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.127
Who the fuck are you?

24:55.127 --> 24:56.262
[ moaning continues  ]

24:56.262 --> 24:57.830
Your newest and bestest.

24:57.830 --> 25:01.234
[Hall] You should stay
and listen to me.

25:01.234 --> 25:04.003
Or else this goes viral.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.705
You're making me weak.

25:05.705 --> 25:07.740
"You're making me weak."

25:07.740 --> 25:09.609
[scoffs]

25:09.609 --> 25:12.044
We have -- We have training
against this.

25:12.044 --> 25:14.680
You think you're gonna
fucking blackmail me?

25:14.680 --> 25:17.283
So what? I fuck girls, guys.
Who cares?

25:17.283 --> 25:18.584
Everyone fucks.

25:18.584 --> 25:21.587
That thing has no chance
to compromise me.

25:21.587 --> 25:23.222
I hope it at least
gets you off, man.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.926
What gets me off

25:26.926 --> 25:30.596
would disturb you
at such a deep level, honey,

25:30.596 --> 25:33.065
you'd be best-served
never to think about it again.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.605
[Hall]
Folks in your line care

25:39.605 --> 25:41.574
about that kind of thing,
though.

25:41.574 --> 25:43.309
And this --

25:43.309 --> 25:46.312
your hair...

25:46.312 --> 25:48.915
which will test positive
for cocaine,

25:48.915 --> 25:53.019
can be in Chuck Rhoades' hands
within an hour.

25:53.019 --> 25:57.089
You're gonna watch,
listen, and report,

25:57.089 --> 25:59.725
and everything's
gonna be fine.

26:03.095 --> 26:05.097
It's a lot to take in.

26:07.767 --> 26:09.235
We've already gone through
all of this crap.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.904
I heard back
from my sources.

26:11.904 --> 26:14.106
There's a war room
set up at Birch's.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.108
Lawyers, accountants --
the whole thing.

26:16.108 --> 26:18.110
Guys at his shop
are prepping their rÃ©sumÃ©s.

26:18.110 --> 26:21.213
Well, if it was just smoke,
they'd issue a denial --

26:21.213 --> 26:22.648
keep working.

26:22.648 --> 26:24.984
Yeah. They're treating this
article like it's a warrant.

26:24.984 --> 26:26.752
Somebody wanted
to hurt Birch,

26:26.752 --> 26:28.788
and they wanted us
on the ass end.

26:28.788 --> 26:31.657
So they leaked it.

26:31.657 --> 26:32.925
And I do not like it.

26:32.925 --> 26:35.127
We need the reins
back in our hands.

26:35.127 --> 26:36.162
Understood.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.230
You want me to stay
on this Axe/Decker thing?

26:38.230 --> 26:40.866
[Chuck]
No. Set that aside.

26:40.866 --> 26:42.301
Until we know
at least as much

26:42.301 --> 26:44.070
as this fucking reporter
knows,

26:44.070 --> 26:45.938
let's keep the brights
on Steven Birch.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.039
All right.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.174
[Chuck]
Get me every article

26:48.174 --> 26:51.911
Randy Kornbluth wrote
in the past year.

26:51.911 --> 26:53.713
All of Mike Dimonda's
articles, too.

26:53.713 --> 26:55.247
We'll start there.

27:08.694 --> 27:10.096
Mike.

27:10.096 --> 27:12.398
[car door opens]

27:15.835 --> 27:18.337
Good parlor trick,
knowing my address.

27:18.337 --> 27:20.706
That'll look like
a fun intimidation tactic

27:20.706 --> 27:21.707
when I write this up.

27:21.707 --> 27:24.176
Oh. You're not
writing this up.

27:24.176 --> 27:25.845
Because that would be
a small win,

27:25.845 --> 27:28.247
and you're not in it
for small wins.

27:28.247 --> 27:30.416
No, you've come too far.
Too young an age for that.

27:30.416 --> 27:32.385
I'm in it because people
deserve to know the truth

27:32.385 --> 27:34.053
about power and money and --
Whoa. Wait a minute.

27:34.053 --> 27:36.722
What are you, Glenn Greenwald
all of a sudden?

27:36.722 --> 27:37.323
Come on.

27:37.323 --> 27:38.391
[both chuckle]

27:40.226 --> 27:42.962
You know, I've, uh,
I've been reading...

27:42.962 --> 27:45.264
Randy Kornbluth lately.

27:45.264 --> 27:48.000
He usually covers
state politics.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.936
He hasn't had a hard
business story in 18 months,

27:50.936 --> 27:52.304
but all of a sudden,

27:52.304 --> 27:54.907
he hooks into
a full-blown crime story --

27:54.907 --> 27:56.375
on Steven Birch.

27:57.777 --> 27:59.311
His article quotes

27:59.311 --> 28:02.148
former federal prosecutor
James Robbins,

28:02.148 --> 28:03.816
who says
that the connection

28:03.816 --> 28:06.352
between hedge funds
and company officials

28:06.352 --> 28:08.187
must be probed.

28:09.789 --> 28:12.291
You know who else
likes quoting James Robbins?

28:12.291 --> 28:13.926
You.

28:13.926 --> 28:16.262
Seven times
in the past six months.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.097
He's a widely respected source
with connections --

28:18.097 --> 28:20.199
He's a fucking
rent-a-quote.

28:20.199 --> 28:23.369
I know you really wrote
the Birch story,

28:23.369 --> 28:27.907
and I think I know why
you chose to hide that fact.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.809
If I am
such a careerist,

28:29.809 --> 28:31.310
why would I ever hide
something that good?

28:31.310 --> 28:33.879
'Cause you thought
it would endear you to someone.

28:36.082 --> 28:37.283
What you should have done,

28:37.283 --> 28:40.019
if you were really playing
an elevated game,

28:40.019 --> 28:42.455
was come to me
with what you had.

28:42.455 --> 28:44.190
See, if I had
something better to give you

28:44.190 --> 28:45.491
in exchange
for you holding on to it --

28:45.491 --> 28:46.959
You have never been willing

28:46.959 --> 28:48.394
to play any kind of game
with me.

28:48.394 --> 28:50.963
I didn't know you were ready
to play in the bigs, man.

28:50.963 --> 28:52.498
Now I do.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.166
So, these are the rules.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.734
You tell me
who fed you that --

28:55.734 --> 28:57.336
No.

28:57.336 --> 28:59.872
I'm gonna head inside.

28:59.872 --> 29:01.807
Because this conversation
has peaked,

29:01.807 --> 29:05.177
and you  don't
get to tell me the rules.

29:05.177 --> 29:06.745
You're correct.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.914
I'm not gonna write up
this ambush.

29:08.914 --> 29:10.349
But I can.

29:10.349 --> 29:13.285
[Michael]
Anytime I want to.

29:13.285 --> 29:15.321
So think about that
the next time

29:15.321 --> 29:17.790
you try and bar me
from a press conference

29:17.790 --> 29:19.358
or dodge my call.

29:19.358 --> 29:21.127
Have a good night.

29:23.062 --> 29:24.463
[keys jingle]

29:24.463 --> 29:27.466
[door opens, closes]

29:29.068 --> 29:30.970
â™ªmid-tempo musicâ™ª

29:34.140 --> 29:36.075
All right.
Thank you.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.948
Uh...

29:42.948 --> 29:44.817
you know what?

29:44.817 --> 29:46.051
Here's the $20

29:46.051 --> 29:48.220
for whatever the guy in
the blue shirt back there wants.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.055
[man] I got you.
Okay, thank you.

29:50.055 --> 29:51.824
[Chuck] Okay, guys, let's go.
Come on.

29:51.824 --> 29:54.193
Now, you guys remember
when we threw Grandpa

29:54.193 --> 29:55.528
a surprise party
for his birthday

29:55.528 --> 29:57.196
and we all
had to keep the secret?

29:57.196 --> 29:58.330
Yeah.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.099
Okay. Why do we
have to keep the secret?

30:00.099 --> 30:01.433
To make Grandpa happy.

30:01.433 --> 30:03.369
Right.
So this is like that, okay?

30:03.369 --> 30:05.137
We don't tell anyone
about the doughnuts

30:05.137 --> 30:06.972
to make Mommy  happy.

30:06.972 --> 30:07.873
Okay?

30:08.941 --> 30:09.975
[Kroll] Rhoades!

30:09.975 --> 30:13.179
Don't you walk away
before you meet my kids.

30:14.280 --> 30:17.349
Mr. Kroll,
we are in a public place...

30:17.349 --> 30:19.885
with, uh, as you say,
our children.

30:19.885 --> 30:22.888
Uh, why don't you guys go sit
on the bench over there, okay?

30:22.888 --> 30:24.557
Take your sister
over there.

30:25.558 --> 30:29.995
I-I don't need
your, um...kindness now.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.097
I-I needed it
at sentencing.

30:35.167 --> 30:38.504
This is
Margo and Stevie.

30:39.438 --> 30:40.839
Hello.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.042
I kept them out of school today
so we could be together

30:43.042 --> 30:44.944
because I go to prison
tomorrow.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.080
How do you
live with yourself?

30:48.080 --> 30:49.481
How?

30:49.481 --> 30:50.616
Yeah.

30:51.984 --> 30:53.219
I think long and hard

30:53.219 --> 30:57.523
before any prosecution
in my office goes forward.

30:57.523 --> 31:01.160
And I'm proudest of the cases
I choose not  to prosecute.

31:01.160 --> 31:04.597
But when I go forward,
it's full guns.

31:04.597 --> 31:07.166
I made
one goddamn mistake.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.635
And who got hurt?

31:09.635 --> 31:10.569
No one.

31:10.569 --> 31:11.637
[Kroll]
You could have let it go.

31:11.637 --> 31:12.938
You committed mail fraud.

31:12.938 --> 31:16.275
And you knew
that my wife had died...

31:16.275 --> 31:18.244
suddenly...

31:18.244 --> 31:20.446
and that I was
desperate and lost.

31:20.446 --> 31:21.880
Y-You read the articles.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.315
You -- You got letters
from 100 people

31:23.315 --> 31:25.884
who vouched for the man
that I was and would be again.

31:27.386 --> 31:30.489
I'm what those kids
have left.

31:30.489 --> 31:34.560
And they won't have me again
for four years.

31:36.161 --> 31:37.930
Have a nice stroll
with yours.

31:37.930 --> 31:39.565
And take your fucking $20

31:39.565 --> 31:42.568
or just...leave it here
for the birds to pick at.

31:45.170 --> 31:46.405
[Kroll] Let's go, kids.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.307
Daddy's done
with this asshole.

31:53.445 --> 31:55.014
[Butch]
You wanted to see me?

31:55.014 --> 31:56.382
Hey.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.685
I want to give you a short

31:59.685 --> 32:02.421
that you're not gonna bail on
too quick.

32:02.421 --> 32:03.922
Do you know Cross-Co.?

32:03.922 --> 32:05.624
Cross-Co. Trucking.
I've been tracking it.

32:05.624 --> 32:08.427
Mid-size firm,
has a big distribution contract

32:08.427 --> 32:10.462
with that bakery company
YumTime.

32:10.462 --> 32:12.231
Been holding 50.

32:12.231 --> 32:14.433
Fundamentals are solid.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.402
I don't see
the short play.

32:16.402 --> 32:19.171
I don't need you to see it.
I need you to do  it.

32:19.171 --> 32:21.573
We'll get 50 on the tape.
We'll size up later.

32:23.642 --> 32:27.079
[Bobby] You got
a fucking problem with this?

32:27.079 --> 32:28.047
No.

32:34.320 --> 32:35.487
[sighs]

32:35.487 --> 32:37.156
You plug
that investor leakage?

32:37.156 --> 32:39.124
I thought I'd done
exactly that,

32:39.124 --> 32:41.527
but I haven't been able
to get Garth Sykes on the phone.

32:42.428 --> 32:44.296
He bails, it hurts us.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.031
Yeah. I tried.

32:46.031 --> 32:48.434
But I think I need you
to show face with this guy.

32:48.434 --> 32:50.135
You got this.

32:50.135 --> 32:51.403
That's why I have you.

32:51.403 --> 32:52.671
[keyboard clacking]

32:52.671 --> 32:55.574
[birds chirping]

32:55.574 --> 32:57.676
That fucker thinks that
if you  come running over here,

32:57.676 --> 33:00.546
I'm gonna forget he fired me
in front of everyone I know?

33:00.546 --> 33:02.247
Who knows
what he thinks?

33:02.247 --> 33:04.149
One minute,
you're his most trusted advisor,

33:04.149 --> 33:06.385
the next,
you're on the outside.

33:06.385 --> 33:08.153
I'm here because...

33:08.153 --> 33:09.722
I think you might
make it worse for yourself,

33:09.722 --> 33:11.190
and I don't want
to see that.

33:11.190 --> 33:13.425
The money I made him...

33:13.425 --> 33:15.260
He treated me
like a lowlife.

33:15.260 --> 33:17.429
And that's a trigger
for you.

33:17.429 --> 33:19.331
Everyone laughing at me
growing up.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.066
The dyslexia.

33:21.066 --> 33:22.468
Even the teachers.

33:22.468 --> 33:24.169
I sent
every one of those pricks

33:24.169 --> 33:26.538
a photo of my first
million-dollar bonus check.

33:26.538 --> 33:30.075
That made you feel really good
for about 24 hours,

33:30.075 --> 33:31.310
and then
you hated yourself

33:31.310 --> 33:33.645
for letting them know
they ever got to you.

33:33.645 --> 33:34.747
Kind of.

33:34.747 --> 33:37.149
Sometimes.

33:37.149 --> 33:39.118
This is different.

33:39.118 --> 33:41.553
I know plenty about
how Axe Capital works --

33:41.553 --> 33:43.155
the dirty edge...

33:43.155 --> 33:45.491
the proprietary trading
techniques.

33:45.491 --> 33:47.092
I know how
the secret sauce is made.

33:47.092 --> 33:47.693
Yeah.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.027
I'm sure
you could put out

33:49.027 --> 33:50.396
a Schott's Miscellany
about the place.

33:50.396 --> 33:51.663
Schott's?

33:51.663 --> 33:54.733
It's like a Farmers' Almanac
for non-farm stuff.

33:54.733 --> 33:57.603
Then, yeah, I could put out
a couple of volumes

33:57.603 --> 33:59.271
of Schott's Miscellany
about the place.

33:59.271 --> 34:01.673
You just need to ask yourself
one question first --

34:01.673 --> 34:04.343
are you rich enough
to never get another job?

34:08.580 --> 34:10.783
I did work
for that man.

34:10.783 --> 34:12.551
Bribed an oil company C.F.O.
for him --

34:12.551 --> 34:14.052
Stop talking.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.054
We're not in session.
That's not privileged.

34:16.054 --> 34:19.625
Point is, I got
all muddied up for him.

34:19.625 --> 34:22.461
Hard not to rub it
on his clean, white shirt now.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.101
Remember Warren Jaffin,
the analyst?

34:30.269 --> 34:31.537
Yeah.

34:31.537 --> 34:33.205
Bright guy?

34:33.205 --> 34:34.339
That kid was sharp.

34:34.339 --> 34:36.308
Employable?

34:36.308 --> 34:37.409
Real  sharp, yeah.

34:37.409 --> 34:40.212
Then he balked at his bonus
one year and got popped.

34:40.212 --> 34:43.148
He got another job right away
at a huge bank --

34:43.148 --> 34:45.217
$3 million a year,
guaranteed.

34:45.217 --> 34:46.385
Only,
word got back to Axe

34:46.385 --> 34:48.587
that Warren had badmouthed him
in the interview --

34:48.587 --> 34:50.789
said Axe
wasn't generous with him.

34:50.789 --> 34:54.126
So Axe called
the head of the bank,

34:54.126 --> 34:57.696
asked him to pull the offer
that day, which the guy did.

34:59.565 --> 35:01.500
Can you imagine...

35:01.500 --> 35:04.269
how humiliating that was
for Warren?

35:04.269 --> 35:06.171
Probably told his whole family,
all his friends

35:06.171 --> 35:07.473
that he was back.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.308
But Axe
didn't leave it there.

35:09.308 --> 35:11.410
He called
the president or chairman

35:11.410 --> 35:14.513
of every prime broker, bank,
and fund in the industry

35:14.513 --> 35:15.781
and had him blackballed.

35:15.781 --> 35:17.549
Put it out
over the loudspeaker,

35:17.549 --> 35:19.518
direct from
the principal's office --

35:19.518 --> 35:23.188
"If you hire Warren Jaffin,
you are my enemy."

35:24.490 --> 35:27.860
[Wendy] Do you know
what Warren does now?

35:29.595 --> 35:31.263
He's got a blog.

35:34.299 --> 35:37.269
You've built a real life
for yourself, Victor --

35:37.269 --> 35:38.637
a long way from Queens.

35:38.637 --> 35:39.872
[sighs]

35:39.872 --> 35:42.140
If Axe is certain
you'll act like a gentleman,

35:42.140 --> 35:44.610
he will make sure
to take care of you.

35:46.278 --> 35:47.746
You were the one
that always told me

35:47.746 --> 35:49.248
to stand up for myself.

35:49.248 --> 35:52.618
When you can win, yes.

35:52.618 --> 35:56.421
The only way you can win now
is by letting it go.

36:02.461 --> 36:05.764
You know,
I have to confess to something.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.165
Okay.

36:07.165 --> 36:08.534
[sighs]
You're not gonna like it.

36:08.534 --> 36:10.235
Fire away.

36:10.235 --> 36:13.272
I took the kids
for doughnuts.

36:13.272 --> 36:15.374
I know.

36:15.374 --> 36:16.808
Kevin told me.

36:18.544 --> 36:19.545
Good.

36:19.545 --> 36:20.812
Oh.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.414
You're glad he cracked?

36:22.414 --> 36:25.450
No, I never want them
to keep secrets from you.

36:25.450 --> 36:27.953
They're gonna keep them from me
their entire teenage years.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.187
They should at least know

36:29.187 --> 36:31.557
that they always can confide
in you.

36:31.557 --> 36:36.228
[Chuck] And among your many
gifts, that is a great one.

36:36.228 --> 36:39.765
Everyone feels like
you're always on their side.

36:39.765 --> 36:42.968
Well, I try  to be,
or at least...

36:42.968 --> 36:45.337
understand
where they're coming from.

36:45.337 --> 36:46.939
[Chuck] That's
the wonderful part of your job.

36:46.939 --> 36:49.508
You get to employ
your empathy.

36:50.676 --> 36:55.614
I have to be a real prick
sometimes, you know?

36:55.614 --> 36:56.882
At work.

36:56.882 --> 36:59.217
Yeah.

36:59.217 --> 37:02.588
Sometimes, we all  do things
we're not proud of at work.

37:02.588 --> 37:04.556
[Chuck]
Well, this is different.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.226
When I was in the park
with the kids,

37:08.226 --> 37:10.662
there was this guy
who...

37:11.830 --> 37:15.334
Specifics don't matter.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.668
What does is,

37:16.668 --> 37:20.405
that every once in a while,
there's this thing we say --

37:20.405 --> 37:21.807
"I am never so proud

37:21.807 --> 37:25.911
as when I choose
not  to prosecute a case."

37:25.911 --> 37:29.381
And that's true --
in theory.

37:29.381 --> 37:33.518
But once in a while, I wish
that I could just be more...

37:35.821 --> 37:37.823
...human.

37:40.525 --> 37:42.527
But I haven't figured out
how to do that

37:42.527 --> 37:45.731
and  my job
at the same time.

37:45.731 --> 37:46.832
You know?

37:46.832 --> 37:50.469
Being 100% good
at your job...

37:52.638 --> 37:55.507
...and 100% good...

37:57.409 --> 37:58.744
...if you figure
that one out,

37:58.744 --> 38:00.646
let's both quit
and write that book.

38:02.981 --> 38:04.883
â™ªexotic musicâ™ª

38:08.053 --> 38:09.988
[men groaning]

38:09.988 --> 38:12.991
[chuckles softly]

38:12.991 --> 38:14.860
It's a luxury to relax
every once in a while,

38:14.860 --> 38:16.328
isn't it, Garth?

38:16.328 --> 38:18.897
I remember this place --
fondly.

38:18.897 --> 38:20.832
Look, the stability
of this firm

38:20.832 --> 38:22.501
has never been in question.

38:22.501 --> 38:25.904
I need to look into
Axelrod's eyes, hear him  say it.

38:25.904 --> 38:27.939
Yeah, he will.

38:27.939 --> 38:29.775
I just wanted
to hear you first.

38:29.775 --> 38:32.444
I may be from Kentucky,
but I'm no rube.

38:32.444 --> 38:33.645
I don't bet on long shots

38:33.645 --> 38:36.682
when it comes to investing
the pensions of my members.

38:36.682 --> 38:39.918
That's why they trust me
with their $5 billion.

38:39.918 --> 38:43.355
I get nervous, I see someone
like Axelrod running around

38:43.355 --> 38:46.058
spending his money
like he's a goddamn rap singer.

38:46.058 --> 38:48.894
Emcee.
Like a rap emcee.

38:48.894 --> 38:51.563
No, some of 'em sing now.
My kids showed me.

38:51.563 --> 38:54.399
Snoop and Kid Rock both.

38:54.399 --> 38:58.336
You're right --
you are no rube.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.839
But Bobby Axelrod isn't,
either.

39:00.839 --> 39:03.842
We've crushed the S&P
seven years running,

39:03.842 --> 39:07.412
which means
you  have crushed the S&P.

39:07.412 --> 39:09.014
[woman]
You turn over now.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.449
[groans]

39:10.449 --> 39:13.719
Everyone  beats it --
till they don't.

39:13.719 --> 39:16.888
When I can I see Axe,
talk to him about it?

39:16.888 --> 39:19.558
You don't want
to rush off now,  do you?

39:19.558 --> 39:20.926
[both moan]

39:20.926 --> 39:22.928
â™ªpensive musicâ™ª

39:25.864 --> 39:28.934
Here's McCue.
She got some stuff on Birch.

39:28.934 --> 39:31.136
You are gonna love
my nuts.

39:31.136 --> 39:33.438
Pierre Bernard,

39:33.438 --> 39:35.474
longtime C.F.O.
of the Arcadian,

39:35.474 --> 39:37.375
gets passed over for C.E.O.,

39:37.375 --> 39:38.610
gets censured internally

39:38.610 --> 39:40.078
for certain
financial improprieties.

39:41.646 --> 39:43.849
Press clippings
I thought you might want.

39:43.849 --> 39:46.051
And Bernard interviews
for a job at Birch

39:46.051 --> 39:47.652
shortly before the trades.

39:47.652 --> 39:50.088
We have secretaries on
both sides confirming the meet.

39:50.088 --> 39:54.526
Birch's trades in Arcadian
occur a half-hour afterward.

39:54.526 --> 39:56.161
[Terri] We alerted
our counterparts up north.

39:56.161 --> 39:58.130
The railroad
has fired Bernard.

39:58.130 --> 40:00.031
The Canadians are
considering prosecution.

40:00.031 --> 40:02.400
He's ready to make
a statement implicating Birch.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.035
At Quantico, they call a case
this straightforward --

40:04.035 --> 40:05.604
Nobody cares.

40:05.604 --> 40:06.671
Of course not.
Why would they?

40:06.671 --> 40:09.074
Rookies always bring up
Quantico.

40:10.809 --> 40:12.644
Uh, do you need
something else?

40:13.578 --> 40:16.548
Let me know if you need
PDF backups of those.

40:16.548 --> 40:17.549
[Bryan] Will do.

40:17.549 --> 40:18.884
He is  right, though.

40:18.884 --> 40:20.886
This Birch thing's
a dunker.

40:22.721 --> 40:24.756
Dominique all day.

40:26.591 --> 40:28.927
Wilkins!

40:43.141 --> 40:45.877
So, tomorrow morning, when
the arrest warrant is issued,

40:45.877 --> 40:47.112
along with a search warrant,

40:47.112 --> 40:49.714
we meet near Birch's firm,
all right?

40:49.714 --> 40:52.017
[Bryan] You guys take him,
we take his records.

40:52.017 --> 40:53.885
Hey, quick question.
Alan.

40:53.885 --> 40:55.120
Are we
gonna handcuff him?

40:55.120 --> 40:56.488
Yeah, obviously.

40:56.488 --> 40:59.024
[man] What about the S.E.C.?
Should we alert them?

40:59.024 --> 41:00.158
We already have.

41:00.158 --> 41:01.159
[Terri] Press?

41:01.159 --> 41:02.627
Probably, all right?

41:02.627 --> 41:04.129
I mean, those news cameras

41:04.129 --> 41:07.065
just have a way of showing up
at the right time, don't they?

41:07.065 --> 41:08.567
[laughter]

41:08.567 --> 41:09.835
[man] So, we're gonna hit 'em
full-on, right?

41:09.835 --> 41:11.002
[Bryan] Yes.

41:11.002 --> 41:12.237
[echoing]
We'll get local law enforcement

41:12.237 --> 41:13.939
there on the perimeter,
but with the lights out.

41:13.939 --> 41:15.173
[laughter]

41:15.173 --> 41:19.010
[talking continues
indistinctly, echoes]

41:19.010 --> 41:21.913
[Bryan] All right,
any more questions?

41:21.913 --> 41:25.217
[talking continues
indistinctly, echoes]

41:25.217 --> 41:26.117
Bryan?

41:29.888 --> 41:31.957
Let's put a pin
in the arrest.

41:31.957 --> 41:32.691
Boss?

41:32.691 --> 41:34.159
Get Birch in here.

41:34.159 --> 41:35.560
It's time to settle.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.596
No, no. N-No way.

41:37.596 --> 41:40.498
We -- We have him dead to rights
on this trial.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.834
I'm first chair.
Then it's jail for this jamoke.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.036
We have him dead to rights,
so he'll fold quick,

41:45.036 --> 41:48.173
and then we get back to
what we were doing -- Axelrod.

41:48.173 --> 41:52.510
I'm not letting us follow
the riderless horse any longer.

41:52.510 --> 41:53.612
Wait.
Riderless h--

41:53.612 --> 41:55.780
Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid.

41:55.780 --> 41:57.148
They were smart.

41:58.984 --> 42:01.786
They sent one of their horses
off in a different direction

42:01.786 --> 42:04.522
so the posse
would have to split up...

42:04.522 --> 42:06.892
get distracted.

42:06.892 --> 42:10.829
But this was
no ordinary posse.

42:10.829 --> 42:14.132
This was a super posse --
the  super posse.

42:14.132 --> 42:15.901
Mixed group
of superheroes --

42:15.901 --> 42:18.570
a sheriff,
a marshal, an Indian.

42:18.570 --> 42:20.105
"Native American."

42:21.106 --> 42:22.007
Sure.

42:22.007 --> 42:23.141
And the Cherokee --

42:23.141 --> 42:25.777
man, he could read
the depth of the impression

42:25.777 --> 42:28.780
the horse's hooves
made on rock.

42:28.780 --> 42:32.851
And when he realized they were
chasing a riderless horse...

42:34.085 --> 42:37.222
...they got right back
on Butch's trail.

42:37.222 --> 42:38.924
I remember now.

42:38.924 --> 42:40.859
I watched it with my dad

42:40.859 --> 42:43.828
on one of the Saturdays
he showed up.

42:43.828 --> 42:46.298
I didn't root
for the super posse.

42:46.298 --> 42:47.966
I rooted
for Butch and Sundance.

42:47.966 --> 42:49.968
Of course you did.
We all  did.

42:52.170 --> 42:54.873
But that's not who we are
anymore.

43:00.946 --> 43:03.982
[light piano music plays,
indistinct conversations]

43:07.352 --> 43:09.154
How are you, Bobby?

43:12.757 --> 43:14.693
Hey, Garth.

43:14.693 --> 43:15.827
Ken.

43:18.363 --> 43:20.098
I'd call you "Sir Ken"
out of respect

43:20.098 --> 43:22.367
for your advanced age
and your accomplishments,

43:22.367 --> 43:24.903
but, as much as you'd like it,
you were born in Chicago,

43:24.903 --> 43:26.838
and no one born there
was ever knighted.

43:26.838 --> 43:28.707
He would  like it
if we called him "sir."

43:28.707 --> 43:30.775
He is  that type.

43:30.775 --> 43:32.911
You are  that type, Ken.

43:32.911 --> 43:34.946
And then
what would we call you,  Axe?

43:34.946 --> 43:38.049
Oh, hell, Kenny, call me
whatever the fuck you want.

43:39.050 --> 43:42.187
[chair scrapes]

43:42.187 --> 43:45.056
Or better,
don't ever call me.

43:45.056 --> 43:46.925
You know the reason
why you should never call me?

43:46.925 --> 43:48.927
Because
you're a poacher, Ken,

43:48.927 --> 43:52.063
and guys like Garth and me,
we do not like poachers.

43:52.063 --> 43:53.398
Come drag a deer
off my land,

43:53.398 --> 43:55.133
see what the fuck
happens to you.

43:56.801 --> 43:59.804
Well, now that you've joined us,
let me ask you --

43:59.804 --> 44:01.139
how you doing?

44:01.139 --> 44:04.109
I'm gonna let you in
on something here, Garth.

44:04.109 --> 44:06.177
Hedge fund guys
only ask that question

44:06.177 --> 44:08.747
when they know
the other guy is running bad,

44:08.747 --> 44:10.949
which he thinks because
you are sitting with him.

44:10.949 --> 44:12.817
Oh, we're
just catching up.

44:12.817 --> 44:14.152
And you still
haven't answered.

44:14.152 --> 44:16.321
[Bobby] It's a "crush
the other guy" business.

44:16.321 --> 44:19.691
It's like "Highlander" --
there can be only one.

44:19.691 --> 44:23.028
[Bobby] I don't blame you, Ken.
I'd do the same thing.

44:23.995 --> 44:26.431
But I'm up 32% this year,

44:26.431 --> 44:29.401
which, from what I know
of your run-and-hide approach,

44:29.401 --> 44:32.904
is 30 points better than
what you are at Vista Verde.

44:32.904 --> 44:35.140
Well, you can call it
what you want,

44:35.140 --> 44:37.175
but I call it "careful."

44:37.175 --> 44:39.778
Risk-averse.

44:39.778 --> 44:41.379
When I opened my fund,

44:41.379 --> 44:43.448
I was very aware
of the responsibility

44:43.448 --> 44:45.750
that people like Garth
put in my hands,

44:45.750 --> 44:48.853
which is why
I hedge my investments.

44:48.853 --> 44:51.389
I protect the downside.

44:52.924 --> 44:55.226
I may not be
a rock star,

44:55.226 --> 44:57.095
but I'm still
plugging away,

44:57.095 --> 44:59.264
all these many years
later.

45:01.166 --> 45:02.934
Have fun
with your plugger.

45:04.169 --> 45:06.337
Can we step away
for a sec?

45:14.746 --> 45:16.181
I love
talking to you, Axe,

45:16.181 --> 45:18.817
and you made us
a shit ton of money, but...

45:18.817 --> 45:22.720
I need to keep things
nice and comfy --

45:22.720 --> 45:24.823
results and  optics.

45:24.823 --> 45:27.392
[Sykes] My job's
to spot a fund manager

45:27.392 --> 45:30.862
taking his eye off the ball
before he strikes out.

45:30.862 --> 45:32.363
That's what my members
count on.

45:32.363 --> 45:36.267
And they see someone like
Kenneth, dry ass that he is,

45:36.267 --> 45:39.437
as solid...

45:39.437 --> 45:42.107
part of the firmament.

45:42.107 --> 45:43.808
Sometimes
that's important.

45:44.876 --> 45:46.177
I hear you.

45:46.177 --> 45:50.081
And I know you hated
the headline in the newspaper.

45:50.081 --> 45:52.417
Do what you have to do.

45:52.417 --> 45:54.319
But I hope
that in the days to come,

45:54.319 --> 45:56.454
you see me
as part of that firmament.

45:58.523 --> 46:00.391
I think you will.

46:07.065 --> 46:08.533
[door closes]

46:10.468 --> 46:13.905
You've all seen
the evidence we've gathered

46:13.905 --> 46:16.207
regarding
your railroad trades.

46:16.207 --> 46:18.343
If we prevail at trial --

46:18.343 --> 46:20.078
which we're confident
we will --

46:20.078 --> 46:21.446
the federal sentencing
guidelines

46:21.446 --> 46:24.549
call for you
to serve 11 years.

46:26.851 --> 46:29.354
We understand that
you have young children.

46:29.354 --> 46:31.256
Well, maybe
they'll be out of college

46:31.256 --> 46:33.324
by the time
you're released.

46:33.324 --> 46:35.827
Maybe you can make it
to their weddings.

46:35.827 --> 46:39.531
[Bryan] But like we told
your lawyers,

46:39.531 --> 46:42.233
we're willing to forgo that
for a quick plea --

46:42.233 --> 46:43.401
an admission of guilt,

46:43.401 --> 46:47.839
a forfeiture money judgment
of $386 million.

46:47.839 --> 46:50.408
[Chuck] As well as the voluntary
shuttering of your fund

46:50.408 --> 46:53.411
and conversion of it
to a family office.

46:53.411 --> 46:55.446
You'll no longer handle
any  outside money.

46:55.446 --> 46:57.882
I can get the S.E.C. in here
right now to do that

46:57.882 --> 46:58.816
if you don't agree.

47:01.119 --> 47:03.021
So, settlement or trial?

47:04.556 --> 47:06.824
We're prepared to fight this
for as long as we --

47:06.824 --> 47:08.293
I...

47:08.293 --> 47:10.929
came here today
to take a deal.

47:11.996 --> 47:14.065
I don't want
to go to jail.

47:15.567 --> 47:18.369
Wise choice, Mr. Birch.

47:18.369 --> 47:19.470
Stay in the light.

47:19.470 --> 47:22.607
You won't be getting
a chance like this again.

47:33.885 --> 47:35.220
This doesn't
have to be over.

47:35.220 --> 47:37.288
I'm actually relieved
we settled.

47:37.288 --> 47:39.257
[door closes]

47:49.167 --> 47:51.302
[cellphone chimes]

48:10.888 --> 48:12.156
[groans]

48:13.891 --> 48:15.026
Comfortable?

48:16.227 --> 48:19.097
For the first time
all fucking day.

48:19.097 --> 48:22.033
Well, I have someone
coming in here soon,

48:22.033 --> 48:24.936
and they might be a little
freaked to see their boss...

48:29.374 --> 48:32.243
I just came by to say
"thank you" and "sorry" --

48:32.243 --> 48:34.012
two words
I don't say very often.

48:34.012 --> 48:37.482
So it's handled
with Victor?

48:37.482 --> 48:40.351
You nailed it --
on every count.

48:40.351 --> 48:42.053
And he got paid.

48:42.053 --> 48:45.657
I used everything I knew about
him to make him capitulate.

48:45.657 --> 48:47.392
That's why
I asked you to go.

48:47.392 --> 48:49.494
[Wendy]
You know why I went?

48:49.494 --> 48:51.529
For you.

48:53.631 --> 48:56.601
You and I...

48:56.601 --> 48:58.436
we've never
let each other down

48:58.436 --> 49:00.438
in all these years.

49:00.438 --> 49:02.273
And I wasn't
about to start

49:02.273 --> 49:05.109
because you  acted
like that never happened.

49:08.613 --> 49:11.015
Cut me out again...

49:11.015 --> 49:12.283
and I'm gone.

49:14.152 --> 49:16.054
I know.

49:16.054 --> 49:18.189
[cellphone vibrates]

49:21.392 --> 49:22.994
[cellphone chimes]

49:27.098 --> 49:28.299
I won't.

49:43.181 --> 49:44.382
Ellis Eads.

49:44.382 --> 49:47.318
We are honored to share this
privilege with you, Mr. Axelrod.

49:47.318 --> 49:48.686
With you, too,
Mrs. Axelrod.

49:48.686 --> 49:50.988
There's no sharing, Ellis.
It's Axelrod Hall now.

49:50.988 --> 49:52.523
No. Of course.
We understand.

49:52.523 --> 49:54.192
You think  you do.

49:56.694 --> 49:58.629
Now, I saw
that when I came in here,

49:58.629 --> 50:00.264
you don't remember me,
Chad.

50:00.264 --> 50:02.300
I know who you are.

50:02.300 --> 50:06.070
But you don't
actually remember.

50:06.070 --> 50:07.004
We've met before.

50:08.740 --> 50:11.642
I caddied at The Spoon
when I was a kid.

50:11.642 --> 50:14.345
It was
the perfect summer job.

50:14.345 --> 50:16.114
I carried
your grandfather's bag

50:16.114 --> 50:17.515
quite a few times.

50:17.515 --> 50:18.783
Your  bag, too, Chad,

50:18.783 --> 50:20.385
in the summer
after middle school.

50:21.652 --> 50:24.789
How funny
that we all end up here.

50:24.789 --> 50:26.691
[Bobby]
Now, here's the thing.

50:26.691 --> 50:29.093
A lot of numbers
have been thrown around --

50:29.093 --> 50:32.797
100 for the naming rights,
25 for your name to come down.

50:32.797 --> 50:36.734
But there is one  number
that really matters to me --

50:36.734 --> 50:39.604
16.

50:39.604 --> 50:40.805
And we'll see

50:40.805 --> 50:42.774
if you still think
it's funny, Chad.

50:42.774 --> 50:46.644
[Bobby] $16 is what
a caddy got paid for a loop.

50:46.644 --> 50:50.681
Four hours of humping bags,
smelling sour cigars,

50:50.681 --> 50:52.617
and watching all of you
lie to each other

50:52.617 --> 50:55.486
about your golf scores
in the 95-degree heat,

50:55.486 --> 50:58.322
but I was happy
for the job.

50:58.322 --> 50:59.690
[Bobby] That 16 bucks --

50:59.690 --> 51:01.325
and I would do two loops
a day,

51:01.325 --> 51:04.228
so it was $32 on a Saturday,
$32 on a Sunday.

51:04.228 --> 51:06.697
By the end of the weekend,
I'd have 64 bucks.

51:06.697 --> 51:07.732
16 weekends,

51:07.732 --> 51:10.635
Memorial to Labor Day,
$1,024.

51:10.635 --> 51:12.837
[Lara]
That was his spending money
for the entire year.

51:12.837 --> 51:15.440
He'd stretch it out
until the next summer.

51:15.440 --> 51:17.275
Pretty much.

51:18.376 --> 51:20.411
Until --

51:20.411 --> 51:22.380
and you were there
for this, Chad --

51:22.380 --> 51:25.383
your grandfather asked me
to read a putt on three.

51:25.383 --> 51:28.085
It was a left-to-right leaker,
and I told him so.

51:28.085 --> 51:30.388
I'd seen the putt
all summer long.

51:30.388 --> 51:34.125
He closed the face, pulled it,
missed it by a foot.

51:34.125 --> 51:35.593
You laughed at him.

51:35.593 --> 51:37.395
[Bobby] You made fun
of his eyesight.

51:37.395 --> 51:40.097
And he turned to me,

51:40.097 --> 51:43.167
and he fired me
right there.

51:43.167 --> 51:47.271
Not from the round,
but from the club.

51:47.271 --> 51:50.441
Now, I needed that $16,
but he didn't give a shit.

51:50.441 --> 51:52.677
Because he was embarrassed
to have missed a putt

51:52.677 --> 51:53.878
in front of his grandson.

51:53.878 --> 51:55.246
Are you saying
we are here

51:55.246 --> 51:56.547
because
of that ancient bullshit?

51:56.547 --> 51:58.483
That's right!

51:58.483 --> 52:00.351
16.

52:00.351 --> 52:02.520
â™ªpensive musicâ™ª

52:02.520 --> 52:04.288
Which is why
I am presenting you

52:04.288 --> 52:08.726
with a check for $25 million

52:08.726 --> 52:10.828
minus 16,

52:10.828 --> 52:13.364
which leaves you
with $9 million.

52:13.364 --> 52:15.333
[gasps]
That is bullshit!

52:15.333 --> 52:16.634
[man] This is unacceptable.
[Chad] Ellis, this is bullshit.

52:16.634 --> 52:19.203
We will walk out of here if
you don't honor the full amount.

52:19.203 --> 52:20.872
No, you won't.

52:20.872 --> 52:23.207
You need this $9 million.

52:23.207 --> 52:25.776
Because none of you --
not one --

52:25.776 --> 52:27.712
has done
a single day of work

52:27.712 --> 52:29.914
from the moment your miserable
prick of a grandfather

52:29.914 --> 52:32.483
fell facedown in the sand
in Palm Beach.

52:32.483 --> 52:35.186
And after reviewing
your holdings,

52:35.186 --> 52:37.221
your business interests,
your debts,

52:37.221 --> 52:39.223
I know that this check
is the only thing

52:39.223 --> 52:42.393
standing between your family
and bankruptcy.

52:42.393 --> 52:45.663
So pick it up,
put it in your pocket,

52:45.663 --> 52:47.632
and walk out of here.

52:47.632 --> 52:49.901
Or I  will.

52:56.674 --> 52:58.543
â™ªbold musicâ™ª

53:00.545 --> 53:02.547
[man]
Let's get out of here.

53:02.547 --> 53:03.948
Mnh!

53:10.488 --> 53:12.590
[Sean]
So, now the Axelrod name

53:12.590 --> 53:17.261
will be forever affixed
to this building for all time.

53:17.261 --> 53:18.629
Or until some guy
richer than me

53:18.629 --> 53:20.331
wants it to come down.

53:22.233 --> 53:23.968
You really
started something.

53:23.968 --> 53:25.636
[saw whirring]

53:25.636 --> 53:27.438
["High Tiding" plays]

53:27.438 --> 53:31.776
â™ªNot that it's wrong,
that it needs rightingâ™ª

53:34.912 --> 53:37.648
â™ªJust all aloneâ™ª

53:37.648 --> 53:40.384
â™ªI've been high tidingâ™ª

53:41.886 --> 53:45.856

53:45.856 --> 53:49.894
â™ªSometimes it drops so lowâ™ª

53:49.894 --> 53:53.898
â™ªAnd I ride as it risesâ™ª

53:53.898 --> 53:58.436
