was sitting on the counter.

change your mind about marrying

Nope.

in something like that.

What do you have to lose?

12:14.100 --> 12:16.102
All right.
I'll give it a shot.

12:16.102 --> 12:17.870
I can't feel any worse ‐‐

12:17.870 --> 12:20.440
oh, no, you could feel way
worse.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.109
Sometimes you think this is the
bottom, but this is just a trap

12:23.109 --> 12:25.612
door to the next layer of hell.

12:25.612 --> 12:26.246
Jackie!

12:26.246 --> 12:31.417
There's room for both of us
to help, Louise!

12:34.654 --> 12:36.823
Thanks for helping, Darlene.

12:36.823 --> 12:40.793
Well, we're about to become
family.

12:40.793 --> 12:42.962
Soy want everyone to be in a
good mood when they come to our

12:42.962 --> 12:47.433
big, fancy wedding.
There, I said it.

12:47.433 --> 12:51.004
Now get used to it.

12:51.004 --> 12:54.841
You want a big wedding?
How are we going to do that?

12:54.841 --> 12:56.409
We don't know that many people.

12:56.409 --> 12:59.946
You don't, but I do.
I have a big family and lots of

12:59.946 --> 13:01.481
friends.
The only difference is I don't

13:01.481 --> 13:01.914
live with them all.

13:01.914 --> 13:07.487
[ Laughter ]

13:07.487 --> 13:08.921
I'm willing to pay, Dan.

13:08.921 --> 13:12.292
Trust me, you're going to
wish you had that money back to

13:12.292 --> 13:14.627
do other things.
Here's a little secret.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.830
I was very happy I married
roseanne.

13:17.830 --> 13:21.401
But if we had shacked up, I
could have had a boat.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.570
I don't want a boat.
But I wish you had one so you

13:24.570 --> 13:30.243
could sleep on it tonight.
I'm going back to my place.

13:30.243 --> 13:33.780
I was at the wedding.
Would have been a pretty crappie

13:33.780 --> 13:37.684
boat.

13:42.522 --> 13:45.358
Louise said to say thank you
so much for squeezing me in.

13:45.358 --> 13:48.227
Oh, sure.
Just finishing up my dinner.

13:48.227 --> 13:50.730
Yeah, you're nothing like I
thought you would be.

13:50.730 --> 13:57.303
No beaded curtains, no crystal
ball, and you're not all scarfy

13:57.303 --> 13:58.137
like Stevie nix.

13:58.137 --> 14:00.106
She's a doubter.

14:00.106 --> 14:03.409
Maybe she gets that from her
mother Beverly, because I am

14:03.409 --> 14:05.411
sensing she's a nasty old
buzzard.

14:05.411 --> 14:10.483
That's unbelievable.
It's one thing to get the name,

14:10.483 --> 14:12.985
but the right kind of bird?

14:12.985 --> 14:18.691
Before you start on this
mess, you mentioned my mother.

14:18.691 --> 14:23.996
I vrhaven't heard from her in
quite a while.

14:23.996 --> 14:28.101
Could you check the after life?

14:28.101 --> 14:31.237
It's unclear whether I should
be paid for one reading or two.

14:31.237 --> 14:31.971
Gotcha.

14:31.971 --> 14:38.611
Let's see here. Mmm.
Oh, my god.

14:38.611 --> 14:39.178
What?

14:39.178 --> 14:42.615
I've never seen anything like
that before.

14:42.615 --> 14:48.020
You're surrounded by such a
toxic cloud, I can't see your

14:48.020 --> 14:48.353
future.

14:48.353 --> 14:50.590
What does that mean, I don't
have a future?

14:50.590 --> 14:54.894
Well, no.
Your cynicism and skepticism is

14:54.894 --> 14:58.898
so strong, I can't Pierce the
veil to give you a reading.

14:58.898 --> 15:02.001
It's like I can't get any light
from you.

15:02.001 --> 15:06.439
You have no spirituality.

15:06.439 --> 15:09.909
You are spot‐on!
Can I split a reading over two

15:09.909 --> 15:10.643
credit cards?

15:10.643 --> 15:13.012
I don't understand.
I came here because my boyfriend

15:13.012 --> 15:15.648
dumped me.
What does having no spirituality

15:15.648 --> 15:16.616
have to do with it?

15:16.616 --> 15:21.320
It's like having barbed wire
all around you.

15:21.320 --> 15:23.923
No one can get close to you.
Am I completely off base here?

15:23.923 --> 15:26.492
Have the rest of your
relationships been healthy?

15:26.492 --> 15:31.297
No. They haven't.
All right. So how do I change it?

15:31.297 --> 15:34.934
Can you kasich a spell or
something?

15:34.934 --> 15:40.940
Someone loved "hocus pocus as
a wild, huh?

15:40.940 --> 15:42.975
You need something larger than
yourself.

15:42.975 --> 15:44.343
Are you talking about god?

15:44.343 --> 15:47.613
It just depends.
It's your journey.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.683
I can't help you with that.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.819
God or no god, it's up to
you.

15:52.819 --> 16:00.493
Scoot over and let me take the
rest of the session. Scoot over!

16:00.493 --> 16:02.061
Good morning.
How did you sleep?

16:02.061 --> 16:05.298
Stick it in your ear!

16:05.298 --> 16:08.835
Okay, look, I'm just confused
why you want a big wedding.

16:08.835 --> 16:11.070
You're like me.
You don't like a lot of fuss.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.339
You don't need fancy things.

16:13.339 --> 16:17.076
I know it's a shock.
But a tough gal like me would

16:17.076 --> 16:19.712
want a church and a dress and a
big wedding cake, the whole

16:19.712 --> 16:27.286
thing. It's a shock to me, too.
But it hit me last night.

16:27.286 --> 16:30.890
It's because my parents never
had a real wedding.

16:30.890 --> 16:33.259
They just went down to the
courthouse like they were paying

16:33.259 --> 16:38.397
off a traffic ticket.
That's how their marriage felt.

16:38.397 --> 16:44.370
I wish I had known that.
Now I feel like a jackass.

16:44.370 --> 16:46.639
You are.
But the name thing is you have

16:46.639 --> 16:50.309
to hear me when I tell you what
I want.

16:50.309 --> 16:53.446
You had 47 years of marriage
with roseanne.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.748
To learn, to read each other's
minds.

16:55.748 --> 17:01.387
When we've been married for 47
years, you can do the same with

17:01.387 --> 17:04.290
me. From that ern on the
mantlepiece.

17:04.290 --> 17:11.163
I think you mean folgers can,
but I get what you're saying.

Â™ª

17:17.436 --> 17:20.006
what you watching?

17:20.006 --> 17:24.076
Oh, it's a documentary about
Einstein and religion.

17:24.076 --> 17:28.648
I'm trying to understand how a
logical, educated person can get

17:28.648 --> 17:31.083
to a place where they believe in
god.

17:31.083 --> 17:37.423
Wait, is my little atheist
losing faith in her lack of

17:37.423 --> 17:38.057
faith?

17:38.057 --> 17:43.996
I am completely lost.
The psychic said that I need

17:43.996 --> 17:49.068
spirituality in my life if i'm
ever going to change.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.270
Do you think there's a god?

17:51.270 --> 17:54.040
I think he's on a break right
now.

17:54.040 --> 17:54.941
But he occasionally returns a

17:54.941 --> 18:02.281
call.

18:02.281 --> 18:04.383
Did you go back to the psychic?

18:04.383 --> 18:05.017
Yeah.

18:05.017 --> 18:06.118
What's wrong?

18:06.118 --> 18:09.889
Bad news. It's my mom.
Still not dead.

18:09.889 --> 18:16.562
[ Laughter ]

18:27.006 --> 18:32.812
Surprised to see me, right?
It's been a long time.

18:32.812 --> 18:36.515
I know I said you don't exist,
but I am going to try to believe

18:36.515 --> 18:41.654
in you.
I once asked my mom if there was

18:41.654 --> 18:48.728
a god and she said, well, if
there's not, we're screwed.

18:48.728 --> 18:52.565
So I hope I'm not screwed.
Hey, thanks for Mark.

18:52.565 --> 18:56.602
And by the way, maybe some day
you'll explain why you gave me

18:56.602 --> 19:01.807
Harris.
Now I lay me down to sleep, I

19:01.807 --> 19:07.413
pray the lord my soul to keep.
And if I die before I wake,

19:07.413 --> 19:09.582
well, I'll know you're still
pissed.

19:09.582 --> 19:16.088
Amen.

Hi, is this kerry Conner?

19:33.072 --> 19:34.006
Yeah, it is.

19:34.006 --> 19:37.410
Hi.
This is Mark Conner from the

19:37.410 --> 19:39.378
Lanford conners.
I have a question for you ‐‐

19:39.378 --> 19:43.482
does your family ever get on you
about any bad habits that you

19:43.482 --> 19:43.815
have?

19:43.815 --> 19:45.951
Umm, lots.

19:45.951 --> 19:53.726
Oh, okay.
Thanks for being a Conner. Bye.

19:53.726 --> 19:56.996
Hey, how is the search for
the Conner gene going?

19:56.996 --> 19:59.632
Half the conners are broke
and drink like fish.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.401
But they're great people.
I hope we get to meet them in

20:02.401 --> 20:03.035
person some day.

20:03.035 --> 20:07.573
I went to a cousin's picnic
once. They stole my shoes.

20:07.573 --> 20:11.544
I can't wait for the reunion.
So what is your conclusion?

20:11.544 --> 20:14.480
It's a mixed bag.
Some of the conners are doing

20:14.480 --> 20:15.648
really well. So who knows?

20:15.648 --> 20:18.184
You know, I think it is up to
you.

20:18.184 --> 20:21.620
I think your genes set you off
in a direction, but you can

20:21.620 --> 20:24.323
change that direction.
Like for example, we don't

20:24.323 --> 20:28.260
change the sheets a lot in this
house, but we could.

20:28.260 --> 20:30.863
Yeah.
And if nothing else, now I know

20:30.863 --> 20:33.799
my genes might be trying to
destroy me, so failure can't

20:33.799 --> 20:35.367
sneak up on me like it did you
guys?

20:35.367 --> 20:38.938
It didn't sneak up on us.
It rang the doorbell and said

20:38.938 --> 20:44.510
