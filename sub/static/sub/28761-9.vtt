-[man 1 over radio]<i> Target is on the move.</i>
-[camera shutter clicking]

00:17.142 --> 00:18.560
[man 2 over radio] <i>I have eyes on target.</i>

00:20.061 --> 00:23.440
The FBI has Phil Brunton
under 24-hour surveillance.

00:23.523 --> 00:26.985
How is Moss' chief strategist
connected to the bioterror threat?

00:27.068 --> 00:29.195
Feds found someone solicited by Brunton

00:29.279 --> 00:32.240
to research and develop
bioethnically targeted infections.

00:32.323 --> 00:33.408
We've confirmed that?

00:33.491 --> 00:35.160
[Rachelle] NSA was brought in,
and they've now tied Brunton

00:35.243 --> 00:37.579
to the dead terrorist, Momberg,
through phone records.

00:37.662 --> 00:41.166
Do I have to tiptoe around
the GOP elephant in the room?

00:41.249 --> 00:43.001
Is Moss involved?

00:43.084 --> 00:44.586
-FBI doesn't know.
-He couldn't be.

00:44.669 --> 00:48.465
Well, if he is, his loyal attack weasel
will never tell.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.008
Moss is ahead in the polls.

00:50.091 --> 00:52.761
Brunton will stay quiet,
hoping for a pardon if he wins.

00:54.053 --> 00:55.889
Where are we at with the arrest?

00:55.972 --> 00:59.517
That is the question
causing a run on Imodium at the DOJ.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.936
The grand jury handed down
a sealed indictment,

01:02.020 --> 01:05.774
but Director Vargas prides himself
on keeping the FBI apolitical.

01:05.857 --> 01:09.402
Which is why they back-channeled this
through the White House Counsel's office.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.738
The bureau has a long-standing protocol

01:11.821 --> 01:14.115
of refraining from making
major decisions in investigations

01:14.199 --> 01:17.285
-in the weeks preceding an election.
-We're less than a week out.

01:17.368 --> 01:18.453
An arrest now gives the appearance

01:18.536 --> 01:20.580
that they're using their authority
to influence the outcome.

01:20.663 --> 01:23.041
We don't know what Brunton could do
if he's allowed to remain free.

01:23.124 --> 01:26.377
I'm sorry, but I have to step in here.
My job is to protect the American people.

01:26.461 --> 01:28.004
And my job is to protect you.

01:28.088 --> 01:31.341
As president, you do not have authority
to order a prosecution.

01:31.424 --> 01:34.093
Abuse of power opens you
to a range of consequences.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.553
And think of the optics.

01:35.637 --> 01:38.056
Ordering the arrest
of your political rival's top surrogate?

01:38.139 --> 01:39.766
I still have to do something.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.185
Your interference
could jeopardize the case.

01:44.145 --> 01:45.605
I strongly advise you stay out of it.

01:46.439 --> 01:49.442
Okay, fine.
Thank you, Rachelle. Thank you.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.031
She's right about the optics.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.201
You're behind in the polls.
It'll look political.

02:01.329 --> 02:02.497
You know Vargas.

02:06.417 --> 02:08.419
[theme music playing]

02:25.562 --> 02:27.397
You're speaking
on behalf of the president?

02:27.480 --> 02:29.941
He wants you to know
that this isn't a White House

02:30.024 --> 02:32.610
that's going to interfere
in an investigation.

02:32.694 --> 02:35.989
Then why are we meeting
in a security camera blind spot, Mars?

02:36.072 --> 02:39.159
Vargas, the FBI should proceed
by the book.

02:39.242 --> 02:40.160
We are.

02:41.035 --> 02:43.288
We don't put our thumb
on the electoral scale.

02:43.371 --> 02:45.665
I was referring to the part that says,

02:45.748 --> 02:50.670
when there's a bioterrorism threat,
you haul ass to keep people safe.

02:51.337 --> 02:53.381
Political blowback be damned.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.717
Manipulating an ongoing
criminal investigation

02:55.800 --> 02:57.927
can come back to bite you, Mars.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.890
We have Brunton under surveillance.
We can wait it out.

03:01.973 --> 03:05.435
I understand the FBI
is an independent organization.

03:06.561 --> 03:10.273
But you guys really shit the bed
on this bioterror investigation.

03:10.857 --> 03:11.774
I think we're done here.

03:11.858 --> 03:16.112
The only reason there wasn't a pandemic
of God-knows-what in Houston

03:16.195 --> 03:18.406
was because Hannah Wells
wouldn't let it go

03:18.489 --> 03:22.619
when the FBI shut it down.
It cost her her life.

03:23.870 --> 03:27.957
If there is another attack
between now and election day,

03:28.583 --> 03:29.751
it's on you.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.132
[cell phone vibrating]

03:37.926 --> 03:38.843
[Seth] Hello.

03:39.969 --> 03:43.139
Uh, I'm just going to get some coffee.
I was not watching you sleep.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.683
[cell phone continues vibrating]

03:47.518 --> 03:49.687
Stop bothering me.

03:50.271 --> 03:51.272
Telemarketer?

03:51.898 --> 03:52.899
[Isabel] Worse.

03:53.566 --> 03:54.984
Lorraine.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.153
She keeps hounding me

03:57.237 --> 04:01.074
to go on today's campaign swing
through Florida with Aaron.

04:01.157 --> 04:03.743
-To keep up appearances.
-Will you?

04:03.826 --> 04:06.955
I thought you weren't supposed to
involve yourself in campaign issues.

04:07.038 --> 04:10.041
Hey, I'm on my personal time here.
I'm just an ordinary concerned citizen.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.627
No, I'm not going.

04:13.461 --> 04:14.420
Follow-up question.

04:14.504 --> 04:17.632
Not that I don't love having you
as a houseguest, but...

04:17.715 --> 04:19.425
is there any chance
you guys will get back together?

04:20.718 --> 04:21.552
No.

04:23.304 --> 04:28.977
I know it's unfair to ask you to play
the role of the supportive good spouse,

04:30.270 --> 04:32.355
-but Kirkman's down in Florida.
-Seth... [sighs]

04:32.438 --> 04:34.816
It just sucks that he has
to suffer collateral damage

04:34.899 --> 04:36.150
because of what Aaron did.

04:37.151 --> 04:38.403
Was it really that bad?

04:41.030 --> 04:42.282
He slept with Emily.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.244
Yeah, fuck that asshole.
You're not campaigning for him.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.589
[glass shatters]

05:02.760 --> 05:04.804
[agent 1] Federal agents. Do not move!

05:04.887 --> 05:06.014
What the fuck?

05:06.097 --> 05:08.016
-Phil Brunton?
-You can't just break into my home.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.976
We may enter unannounced
with a no-knock warrant.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.561
Get dressed and come with me.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.230
-Latest numbers are in.
-[Lorraine] Okay.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.900
Kirkman is trailing behind
by four points in Nevada,

05:17.984 --> 05:19.736
and three in Arizona and Tennessee.

05:20.236 --> 05:23.448
Damn it! I've got to turn
some of this purple to gold.

05:23.531 --> 05:25.491
You're like a reverse Midas.

05:25.575 --> 05:26.826
Shoot the messenger, please.

05:26.909 --> 05:30.538
If these numbers hold,
there is no path to victory.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.334
Is there any movement in his home state?

05:34.417 --> 05:35.960
No, looks like New York's
still going to Porter.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.962
Well, screw New York.

05:38.046 --> 05:40.465
If they're gonna keep sucking
Democrat balls,

05:40.548 --> 05:43.634
then I'm not wasting any more
of my precious funds on them.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.845
Too late. POTUS is doing
a whistle-stop there tomorrow.

05:45.928 --> 05:49.015
Give my regards to Broadway.
We're scuttling that New York trip.

05:49.098 --> 05:51.726
Let's reroute him some place
where he has a chance.

05:51.809 --> 05:54.353
There was a small uptick in Texas
after the Houston incident.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.773
-I'm sorry. Are you high?
-[woman] Oh, my God! Turn it up.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.191
[reporter on TV] <i>It's now confirmed</i>
<i>that Phil Brunton,</i>

05:58.274 --> 06:01.569
<i>the chief domestic strategist</i>
<i>for the Moss presidential campaign,</i>

06:01.652 --> 06:05.364

06:09.285 --> 06:15.458
Whoo-hoo! October surprise, bitches.
All bets are off for Moss now.

06:15.541 --> 06:18.169
Texas is officially in play!

06:21.255 --> 06:24.092
The Performing Arts Center in Albany
is shaped like an egg.

06:24.175 --> 06:25.176
Can I see?

06:26.844 --> 06:29.597
Like an egg sliced in half.
Do we get to see it today?

06:29.680 --> 06:32.642
Unfortunately, sweetheart, the campaign
is moving at a sprinter's pace

06:32.725 --> 06:36.312
in the 26th mile of a marathon.
And Albany did not make the cut.

06:36.395 --> 06:39.398
Well, egg or no egg,
we'll have a great trip, Pen.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.483
Are you nervous?

06:41.526 --> 06:44.403
-Not really.
-She's too cool to be nervous.

06:44.487 --> 06:46.948
How about you? Are you nervous
about introducing me in Manhattan?

06:47.031 --> 06:50.660
Well, I have a lot of friends there
coming to support me, so that helps.

06:51.869 --> 06:53.704
You look tired. Is everything okay?

06:53.788 --> 06:56.290
I'm not even sure
if I closed my eyes last night.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.793
An insomniac's dream
is a regular person's sleep.

06:59.836 --> 07:01.420
[Lorraine] Hey-ho, good morning.

07:01.504 --> 07:05.299
We got a date with a state
and her name is Texas.

07:05.383 --> 07:08.136
-Ladies, can I have a second?
-We were just leaving.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.179
See you later.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.766
[sighs] What happened to New York?

07:13.850 --> 07:16.727
Phil Brunton happened.
Don't fight me on Texas.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.771
Moss has fallen, and we would be remiss

07:18.855 --> 07:20.565
if we didn't kick him a little
while he's down.

07:20.648 --> 07:23.025
I still can't wrap my head around this.
Could he have known?

07:23.109 --> 07:25.236
The Moss I worked for? No.

07:25.319 --> 07:28.489
But he'd do anything to win,
and you've got to make this all about him.

07:28.573 --> 07:31.659
-He hasn't been implicated.
-He signed the terrorist's paycheck.

07:31.742 --> 07:32.618
Still doesn't mean he knew.

07:32.702 --> 07:33.786
His hands are bloody,

07:33.870 --> 07:36.581
whether he held the knife
or shook the hand of the guy who did.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.624
You've gotta hammer that home
in your speech.

07:39.208 --> 07:42.170
If you swing Texas
and Aaron swings Florida...

07:42.795 --> 07:45.381
-We've got a shot.
-More than a shot, hon.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.424
You win.

07:47.091 --> 07:47.925
[chuckles]

07:48.593 --> 07:51.596
Why is she refusing to take her pain meds?
Put her on the phone.

07:54.098 --> 07:54.932
Hey.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.434
Mom, what's going on?

07:57.018 --> 07:59.437
You know what a fog
that medication puts me in.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.606
Yes, a relatively painless one.

08:01.689 --> 08:05.485
I wanna be clear-headed tonight
when you get home, so we can talk.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.907
-Uh... I'm coming home now.
-No, don't.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.660
-You have work to do.
-If you don't take your meds,

08:14.744 --> 08:17.788
-I have to come home right now.
-For Pete's sake.

08:18.915 --> 08:22.960
It's nothing earth-shattering.
I just wanna be lucid for once.

08:23.544 --> 08:25.087
<i>Maybe beat you at </i>Jeopardy.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.673
I'll take the damn pills.

08:29.300 --> 08:32.345
-You promise?
<i>-Yes. Have a good day at work.</i>

08:33.930 --> 08:35.306
[exhales heavily]

08:42.313 --> 08:45.316
I'll forward you the data analytics
from our impact investing initiative.

08:45.858 --> 08:51.197
Hey. Look, I wanna apologize for Lorraine.
You don't have to go to Florida.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.908
I know I don't. But I'm going anyway.

08:54.492 --> 08:56.077
-Really?
-Not for you, <i>pendejo.</i>

08:56.160 --> 08:57.161
I'm going for POTUS.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.957
Okay? There's no reason he should suffer
for your broken campaign promises.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.917
-Isi, thank you, this--
-Listen to me.

09:03.459 --> 09:05.086
-Here are the ground rules, okay?
-[Aaron] Yeah.

09:05.169 --> 09:07.463
In public,
we're the world's happiest couple.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.840
The second we're offstage,
you don't touch me,

09:09.924 --> 09:12.426
you don't talk to me, you don't exist.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.054
Fine, yeah, whatever you need. All right.

09:17.014 --> 09:21.435
-Is Emily going?
-No. No, her mom is close to the end.

09:21.519 --> 09:25.439
Well, the last time her mother was dying,
she used it as an excuse to fuck you.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.152
Great.
I am looking forward to meeting you.

09:30.695 --> 09:33.197
-I'll... I'll see you at 8:30.
-Sorry.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.908
All right, sounds good.
Hey, do you know what I look like?

09:37.076 --> 09:39.704
Oh, right, of course. [chuckles]

09:39.787 --> 09:41.539
Uh, I'll see you then. Bye.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.709
-A date?
-Uh, no.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.169
That was my daughter's mother.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.212
Stephanie's mom?

09:48.296 --> 09:51.257
You're having dinner with the woman
who bought your sperm 21 years ago?

09:51.340 --> 09:54.677
-That'd be weird. We're having drinks.
-Okay. Is Stephanie gonna be there?

09:54.760 --> 09:57.471
No. I haven't heard from her
since before the debates.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.809
Oh, can you believe this Brunton thing?

10:03.144 --> 10:04.604
Moss had to know about it.

10:05.229 --> 10:08.399
<i>...despicable, last-ditch effort</i>
<i>of the failing Kirkman campaign </i>

10:08.482 --> 10:12.903
<i>to win the election the only way he can,</i>
<i>by fabricating wild conspiracies.</i>

10:12.987 --> 10:14.196
Fuck off.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.782
I can't believe he's trying to spin
Kirkman into this. The craziest thing--

10:16.866 --> 10:19.577
-You slept with Aaron?
-What?

10:20.411 --> 10:23.456
-What is that? Some Lorraine gossip?
-Isabel told me.

10:23.539 --> 10:27.001
-Oh, my God. She's telling everyone?
-I'm the only one she told.

10:27.752 --> 10:31.756
-What, are you two, like, besties now?
-Em. Why'd you do it?

10:32.923 --> 10:35.092
[sighs] Look, it's not an excuse,

10:36.135 --> 10:38.387
but that was one of the worst days
of my life.

10:39.013 --> 10:41.891
I had just found out
that my mom's cancer had spread

10:41.974 --> 10:45.895
and that she wanted
to kill herself, and...

10:48.356 --> 10:53.069
in the moment, there were no consequences
because it felt like the end of the world.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.493
-The bioweapon isn't what we thought.
-[Dianne] What are you talking about?

11:00.576 --> 11:04.205
I finished sequencing the genetic code
Momberg uploaded before he killed himself.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.624
The virus wasn't designed
to kill people of color?

11:06.707 --> 11:07.583
No, not to kill them.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.169
What does it do?

11:10.753 --> 11:13.130
In some ways,
something even more insidious.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.174
Mass sterilization?

11:15.257 --> 11:17.009
That appears to have been
the intended outcome.

11:17.093 --> 11:20.471
The bioweaponized flu was going to be
introduced into populations

11:20.554 --> 11:22.473
with high minority growth rates.

11:22.556 --> 11:25.309
Large swaths of the population
would become infected,

11:25.393 --> 11:26.435
but then they'd get better.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.688
What would be undetectable was that
it had been genetically sequenced

11:29.772 --> 11:32.024
to sterilize its minority hosts.

11:32.108 --> 11:35.111
So this is a long-term plan to change
the demographic of the electorate.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.737
Engineered voter suppression.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.865
But, wait, if they're playing
the long game,

11:39.949 --> 11:41.784
this would have no effect on the election.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.702
Which means Moss would have no motive.

11:43.786 --> 11:46.914
Just the legacy of protecting
the political landscape of the country.

11:46.997 --> 11:49.375
Sir, the American people
have a right to be told about this.

11:49.458 --> 11:52.169
If we release this now,
it'd just be considered a political ploy.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.839
No one would believe it.
Hell, I'm having a hard time believing it.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.216
Don't forget, the genetic code
was briefly on the Web.

11:57.299 --> 12:00.719
If we're lucky, it was downloaded
out of scientific curiosity

12:00.803 --> 12:02.721
of a non-genocidal persuasion.

12:03.931 --> 12:06.851
Regardless,
the news is going to get out. Soon.

12:09.186 --> 12:12.773
And I stress, the weaponized virus
was never released.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.984
We are now past the incubation period

12:15.067 --> 12:17.987
and there are no reported cases
of infection, meaning,

12:18.070 --> 12:21.657
thankfully, for those of us in
the non-pigmentally challenged category,

12:21.740 --> 12:24.827
-no cases of sterilization. Questions?
-[reporters clamoring]

12:24.910 --> 12:28.372
Seth, if the technology is out there,
the threat still exists.

12:28.456 --> 12:31.083
Of course, along with every other
known threat to humanity,

12:31.167 --> 12:32.710
most of which are available on the Web.

12:32.793 --> 12:36.338
We're monitoring the situation closely.
Woe to anyone who tries to use it.

12:36.422 --> 12:39.383
-Dennis.
-Is there evidence that Moss is involved?

12:39.467 --> 12:41.177
Let me answer that question
with a question.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.553
Did Phil Brunton have the resources

12:42.636 --> 12:44.638
to pull off something
of this magnitude alone?

12:44.722 --> 12:47.600
Does the president believe Brunton
was working with an outside group?

12:47.683 --> 12:49.685
As far as I know,
President Kirkman has no knowledge

12:49.768 --> 12:51.270
of any outside group
involved in the matter.

12:51.353 --> 12:54.482
So he believes this was an inside job?
From within the Moss campaign?

12:54.565 --> 12:56.150
As you know, the Hatch Act prevents me

12:56.233 --> 12:58.777
from commenting on matters
related to the campaign.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.029
I just want his gut reaction, Seth.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.364
Does the president think
Moss was involved?

13:02.448 --> 13:05.367
The engineer of Moss' domestic policy
has been arrested

13:05.451 --> 13:08.245
for allegedly trying to end
democracy as we know it

13:08.329 --> 13:09.955
by tipping the demographics
of the electorate

13:10.039 --> 13:13.584
in favor of Moss' party.
Do I really need to spell it out for you?

13:13.667 --> 13:15.377
[clamoring]

13:16.504 --> 13:18.506
Nicely done!

13:19.006 --> 13:21.675
-I kinda got a lady chub.
-Oh, thank you.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.762
They're shitting bricks
over at Moss' campaign headquarters.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.388
I just finished. How do you know that?

13:26.472 --> 13:29.975
Yeah, so start preparing responses
to what Moss is gonna do next.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.477
He's gonna deny any involvement.

13:31.560 --> 13:35.648
Yeah! So pull together any sound bites
of him praising his old friend Phil,

13:35.731 --> 13:37.149
'cause he's gonna act
like he doesn't know the guy.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.734
Like he couldn't pick him
out of a lineup.

13:38.817 --> 13:40.903
How could he claim that?
Phil was a senior advisor.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.030
-He's--
-[Cornelius on TV]<i> I can and I do</i>

13:43.113 --> 13:46.283
<i>unequivocally state</i>

13:46.367 --> 13:50.162

<i>-And while Mr. Brunton...</i>

13:52.414 --> 13:54.124
<i>...must be presumed innocent</i>

13:54.208 --> 13:55.042
[Lorraine] Wait for it.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.586
<i>...I have to say</i>
<i>that I didn't know him very well.</i>

13:57.670 --> 14:00.714
Oh, I wish I could stay
for the press-feeding frenzy,

14:00.798 --> 14:02.091
but I've gotta leave for Texas.

14:02.174 --> 14:06.303
Dontae! <i>Ándale.</i>
Air Force One ain't gonna wait for you.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.889
-Dontae, do me a favor.
-Anything.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.517
-Keep an eye on Lorraine.
-Anything but that.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.143
I know she has a mole
in the Moss campaign.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.020
Just keep your eyes and ears open.

14:18.482 --> 14:19.441
[sighs]

14:19.525 --> 14:22.278
[Penny] It can refuel in mid-air
and it has a whole operating room.

14:22.361 --> 14:25.573
It's packed with military defense systems
in case we're attacked.

14:26.115 --> 14:29.618
Honey, Sasha might not wanna hear
about that stuff right before we fly.

14:29.702 --> 14:33.122
Well, hello, ladies.
Don't you look fabulous.

14:33.205 --> 14:36.125
I almost wore that exact same skirt.
I'm glad I didn't.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.585
You would've won "Who Wore It Best"

14:37.668 --> 14:40.838
-and I hate to lose at anything.
-Only reason I hired her.

14:40.921 --> 14:42.631
-Hey, can I steal you away for a second?
-[Tom] Yeah.

14:43.299 --> 14:46.677
Sweetheart, after we take off,
maybe you can give Sasha the grand tour.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.556
[sighs]

14:52.725 --> 14:55.060
Tom! What is Sasha doing here?

14:55.144 --> 14:58.063
The favor of introducing me at the rally,
which you asked me to get her to do.

14:58.147 --> 15:00.774
Yeah, when we were scheduled
to appear in Manhattan.

15:00.858 --> 15:04.194
-Houston is not Manhattan.
-It's also not the last century.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.697
And how do you think the transgender issue
is gonna play down there?

15:06.780 --> 15:09.533
For your edification, Houston leans
more liberal than conservative.

15:09.617 --> 15:10.868
Until you get to the suburbs.

15:10.951 --> 15:13.913
Please stop painting all Conservatives
with the same brush.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.582
Barbara Bush came to understand
transgender issues,

15:16.665 --> 15:18.125
and she lived in Houston.

15:18.208 --> 15:22.046
Houston is the birthplace
of the anti-trans bathroom movement.

15:22.129 --> 15:22.963
What do you want me to do?

15:23.047 --> 15:25.257
March down there
and throw my sister-in-law off the plane?

15:25.341 --> 15:30.554
We're going to Moss' home turf to try
to turn his fellow Texans against him.

15:30.638 --> 15:35.726
Why, Tom? Why hand his base
something to attack back against?

15:36.894 --> 15:39.855
We're getting ready to take off.
You should probably go find a seat.

15:46.737 --> 15:47.905
Really?

15:47.988 --> 15:51.283
I swear I had nothing to do with this.
I told Lorraine we needed a two-bedroom.

15:51.367 --> 15:53.953
If she thinks this is gonna lead
to a romcom ending,

15:54.036 --> 15:57.164
-I've got a big spoiler alert for her.
-I'll just take the couch.

15:57.247 --> 15:59.333
-[cell phone ringing]
-Have fun.

16:03.587 --> 16:04.755
[speaking Spanish]

16:09.510 --> 16:10.469
What? What's wrong?

16:10.552 --> 16:12.137
Are the tickets refundable?

16:13.138 --> 16:14.556
[mutters inaudibly]

16:14.640 --> 16:16.934
No, <i>Papi,</i> of course we wanna see you.

16:17.017 --> 16:19.728
It's just... Aaron is booked solid
with appearances.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.772
We would hate for you to come
all the way from Puerto Rico

16:21.855 --> 16:24.608
and not have any time to spend with you.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.569
Okay. Yeah, we'll work it out.

16:30.114 --> 16:32.324
He can't wait to meet you either.

16:33.534 --> 16:35.869
Okay, have a safe flight.
[speaking Spanish]

16:35.953 --> 16:37.496
[Aaron sighs]

16:39.373 --> 16:41.583
You haven't told your parents we broke up.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.961
Hadn't gotten around to it yet.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.755
It's been a while.
Could've done it just now.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.258
If only our relationship status
weren't state secret.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.968
You tell your mother everything.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.804
I tried to tell them.

16:53.887 --> 16:54.722
But?

16:57.349 --> 16:59.685
I kept putting it off
until I could do it without crying.

17:00.436 --> 17:01.270
Excuse me.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.912
[Tom] I realized that I didn't even
ask you how you felt

17:18.996 --> 17:21.373
about taking the stage
in Houston tomorrow.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.125
Honestly? Nervous.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.085
I should have told you
about the venue change,

17:25.169 --> 17:27.254
-and if you wanna back out--
-And excited.

17:27.796 --> 17:31.175
I mean, it's actually
a much bigger opportunity.

17:31.842 --> 17:35.596
My intro will be all about you,
but just the fact of me doing it...

17:35.679 --> 17:39.475
If I can normalize transgender
for even one person...

17:43.645 --> 17:44.480
Tom, what?

17:49.443 --> 17:54.948
I need you to understand that, personally,
I am so proud that you would introduce me.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.120
Go on.

18:00.996 --> 18:04.291
But the election's in a few days,
and with this gift that I've been given,

18:04.374 --> 18:06.668
everything that's happening
in the Moss campaign,

18:06.752 --> 18:08.796
I've actually got a shot
at winning this thing.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.173
But, strategically...

18:14.551 --> 18:17.054
you're not the best person
to help me do that.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.973
Sasha, I am so sorry.

18:21.350 --> 18:24.228
But if we can win this election,
I can help change things.

18:24.311 --> 18:26.230
I mean, in a really big way.

18:30.734 --> 18:31.985
I understand.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.540
Thank you.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.125
[door closes]

18:50.129 --> 18:51.463
[Emily] Hey, Mom.

18:52.297 --> 18:55.008
-Where's Tina?
-I sent her home.

18:56.510 --> 18:57.970
You didn't take your pain meds.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.348
[breath trembling]

19:02.724 --> 19:03.559
No.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.731
-No.
-Yeah. Tonight's the night.

19:12.901 --> 19:14.444
Mom, please don't do this.

19:17.447 --> 19:18.740
Come here, baby.

19:19.533 --> 19:20.951
Come sit next to me.

19:22.119 --> 19:23.120
Mom.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.919
Oh, you know I love you, right?

19:33.463 --> 19:34.464
No.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.925
You're gonna have to stick around a while
and convince me.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.093
[Carrie chuckles]

19:40.387 --> 19:42.848
No mother could ever be prouder.

19:43.849 --> 19:48.395
I can leave this world knowing
I created something really special.

19:49.897 --> 19:52.232
You're the best thing I ever did.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.360
I just have one regret.

19:56.695 --> 19:57.529
What?

19:58.530 --> 20:01.575
That I gave you such an asshole
for a father.

20:01.658 --> 20:02.951
[laughing]

20:05.078 --> 20:06.121
It's my bad.

20:09.082 --> 20:12.169
You more than made up for him.

20:14.796 --> 20:16.006
The election's only a few days away.

20:16.089 --> 20:17.799
I thought you were gonna
hold on until after.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.344
I know, baby. I tried.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.180
But I can't.

20:27.601 --> 20:30.729
I know what I'm asking you to do
seems awful.

20:32.064 --> 20:36.276
But if I could choose how I wanted to go,

20:36.360 --> 20:38.320
how I could die happy,

20:39.404 --> 20:42.616
it would be peacefully,

20:43.325 --> 20:46.453
in the arms of the one
I love the most in this world.

20:48.664 --> 20:52.918
You are the only person on Earth
who can give me that.

21:03.679 --> 21:04.680
[chuckles]

21:05.305 --> 21:07.349
Hey, something wrong?

21:08.225 --> 21:10.811
At this moment, absolutely nothing.

21:12.771 --> 21:15.899
I can't remember the last time I cried
because I was happy.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.735
I don't know the exact date,
but it was definitely around

21:18.819 --> 21:21.947
one of my more spectacular
performances in bed.

21:22.030 --> 21:23.031
[both laughing]

21:26.451 --> 21:30.163
Thank you for carving out time for me.
I know how crazed you are.

21:30.247 --> 21:34.293
The madness of running the White House,
your extracurricular activities.

21:35.877 --> 21:36.962
Oh.

21:39.047 --> 21:40.674
I wasn't talking about that.

21:42.050 --> 21:45.721
We have worked through that.
We've moved on.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.933
By extracurricular activities,

21:50.017 --> 21:54.938
I was talking about the Big Pharma scandal
that you helped expose.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.983
You know, it's still claiming casualties.

21:58.066 --> 22:00.277
I've heard Garrett Detwiler
has been asked to resign

22:00.360 --> 22:03.155
from at least three boards he sits on.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.701
There's a couch over there,

22:07.784 --> 22:10.287
but why don't we just go home
and celebrate?

22:10.370 --> 22:11.913
Oh, yes, please.

22:29.306 --> 22:30.682
[exhaling]

22:39.274 --> 22:40.484
[Carrie whimpering]

22:53.663 --> 22:54.498
[grunts]

23:08.303 --> 23:09.679
[groaning]

23:13.100 --> 23:14.392
That's good.

23:17.312 --> 23:18.688
I love you.

23:22.025 --> 23:23.652
Thank you, baby.

23:41.920 --> 23:42.838
Excuse me.

23:42.921 --> 23:45.173
-Can I have the bill, please? Thank you.
-[server] Sure.

23:47.509 --> 23:48.844
[Riya] Seth?

23:49.928 --> 23:53.056
-You can't be Riya.
-And yet I am. [chuckles]

23:54.266 --> 23:55.308
You got here early.

23:55.392 --> 23:57.144
Uh, actually, you're...

23:57.227 --> 23:59.563
You're not what I had pictured.

24:00.147 --> 24:03.275
-What were you picturing?
-I don't know. My mom?

24:03.859 --> 24:05.402
I was way off.

24:06.570 --> 24:09.531
Can you actually leave it open for me?
What can I get you?

24:09.614 --> 24:10.740
A Harvey Wallbanger.

24:10.824 --> 24:12.159
-[server] You got it.
-[laughs]

24:12.242 --> 24:15.203
-Sorry, I thought you were joking.
-No, you have Stephanie's laugh.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.455
Well, actually,
she would have my laugh, right?

24:17.539 --> 24:19.457
Oh, man, she inherited my laugh.

24:19.541 --> 24:21.334
When she hears something silly.

24:21.418 --> 24:24.171
I'll have to make her laugh, then.
Presuming I see her again.

24:24.254 --> 24:28.175
She's been so busy at college.
It's her senior year, you know.

24:28.258 --> 24:29.885
She'll be graduating summa cum laude.

24:29.968 --> 24:33.305
Hey, I graduated summa cum laude,
at Harvard.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.140
Sorry, people always make fun of me

24:35.223 --> 24:36.600
for slipping in the fact
that I went to Harvard.

24:36.683 --> 24:38.226
Don't apologize.

24:38.852 --> 24:41.271
Harvard is the reason I chose your sperm.

24:41.354 --> 24:43.523
-That's what they all say. Just kidding.
-[both laughing]

24:43.607 --> 24:45.650
It's one of the law schools
Stephanie's applied to.

24:45.734 --> 24:47.569
-She's going to law school?
-If she gets in.

24:47.652 --> 24:48.528
Why wouldn't she?

24:48.612 --> 24:51.698
She's got the grades
and the extracurriculars, but nowadays,

24:51.781 --> 24:54.576
you have to pack that application
with stuff that really stands out.

24:59.247 --> 25:00.832
Does the White House have internships?

25:01.416 --> 25:03.501
Yeah, the application's on the website.

25:04.169 --> 25:07.297
I assume those spots go to people
who have connections.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.642
[crying]

25:25.857 --> 25:26.858
[Carrie groans]

25:28.401 --> 25:29.653
Mom?

25:30.779 --> 25:32.822
Mom, can you hear me?

25:35.283 --> 25:36.409
Mom?

25:45.126 --> 25:46.461
[operator over phone]<i> 911.</i>
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

25:46.544 --> 25:50.173
[sobbing] I need an ambulance.
I need an ambulance.

25:50.257 --> 25:51.258
Oh, my God!

25:52.842 --> 25:53.802
Mom.

26:00.850 --> 26:03.019
[machine beeping]

26:08.733 --> 26:10.318
Barbiturate OD. Patient is unresponsive.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.445
I need bemegride and IV naloxone.

26:12.529 --> 26:15.740
Get me a DN tube, blood glucose
and activated carbon.

26:15.824 --> 26:19.411
When we're ready and on my count.
One, two, three.

26:20.829 --> 26:23.540
-Do we know exactly what she took?
-Daughter says pentobarbital.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.167
-[machine beeping rapidly]
-[doctor] She's gone into V-fib.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.171
Does your mother have a DNR?

26:30.255 --> 26:31.172
Can you just save her?

26:31.256 --> 26:32.882
Do you know if she has advanced directive?

26:32.966 --> 26:35.176
You're a doctor. You took an oath!

26:35.260 --> 26:37.429
-Can you please just save her?
-Miss, I need an answer.

26:37.512 --> 26:39.889
-[Emily] I don't know what I did to her!
-Does your mother have a DNR?

26:43.018 --> 26:45.437
[sobbing] Yes, she does.

26:47.564 --> 26:49.190
[flatlining]

26:49.274 --> 26:50.650
[sobbing]

26:52.152 --> 26:54.863
I'm so sorry, Mom.

27:01.745 --> 27:03.663
[reporter on TV] <i>You're watching </i>DC One.

27:03.747 --> 27:05.665
<i>Ted from Saratoga Springs.</i>

27:05.749 --> 27:08.752
[Ted] <i>I just wanna thank President Kirkman</i>
<i>for stopping the attack on our democracy.</i>

27:08.835 --> 27:09.836

27:24.476 --> 27:26.644
-[Rachelle over cell phone]<i> Hello?</i>
-Are you watching <i>DC One?</i>

27:26.728 --> 27:29.314
Mr. President, it's 4:00 a.m.

27:29.397 --> 27:31.399
Nobody's watching <i>DC One</i> right now.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.401
I know you're gonna
stand by your legal advice

27:33.485 --> 27:36.696
for me to stay out of the investigation,
but I think it's ridiculous

27:36.780 --> 27:39.699
that the only information I'm getting
on it is coming from cable news.

27:39.783 --> 27:41.826
I need to know
whether Moss was involved or not.

27:41.910 --> 27:45.205
You're right, sir.
I do stand by my advice.

27:46.373 --> 27:48.792
-Let me walk you through it.
-You don't need to. I get it.

27:48.875 --> 27:53.046
As a candidate, I could appear unethical,
possibly even corrupt.

27:53.129 --> 27:56.758
But as president of the United States,
I feel I'm being negligent,

27:56.841 --> 27:59.135
and I'm having a difficult time
reconciling the two.

27:59.219 --> 28:01.679
Sir, have faith in the FBI.

28:02.472 --> 28:04.057
And for God's sake, get some sleep.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.226
[sighs]

28:07.560 --> 28:08.770
I wish I could.

28:08.853 --> 28:09.687
[all laughing]

28:09.771 --> 28:12.148
That was nothing compared
to the time she met the Pope.

28:12.232 --> 28:13.233
<i>Ay,</i> Mama, no.

28:13.316 --> 28:15.527
-[Aaron] Wait, you met the Pope?
-She threw up on him.

28:15.610 --> 28:17.112
I was one.

28:17.195 --> 28:19.823
The Pope's first and last visit
to Puerto Rico.

28:19.906 --> 28:21.116
-[Aaron] Look--
-Projectile vomit.

28:21.199 --> 28:23.284
She did exactly the same thing
when she met the president.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.912
-[gasps]
-[Rafael and Camila laughing]

28:25.995 --> 28:29.666
So when exactly do you two
move into the Naval Observatory?

28:31.835 --> 28:33.711
You do know that's where
the vice president lives?

28:33.795 --> 28:35.755
Okay, let's not count our chickens.

28:35.839 --> 28:38.049
I've been checking pictures online,

28:38.133 --> 28:41.386
and there's a room
that would make a perfect nursery,

28:41.469 --> 28:44.180
should any babies appear
in the next four years.

28:44.264 --> 28:47.767
Well, if Moss' bioterror attack
had succeeded,

28:47.851 --> 28:50.019
there'd be no Latino babies
appearing anywhere.

28:50.103 --> 28:52.188
So Moss was behind it?

28:52.272 --> 28:55.775
-Well, we don't know that.
-He hired Phil Brunton as policymaker.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.485
His policy is genocide.

28:57.569 --> 28:59.112
Will people still vote for Moss?

28:59.195 --> 29:00.864
Sadly, his base will.

29:01.448 --> 29:06.578
But I think that people who've lost touch
with the importance of their heritage...

29:07.203 --> 29:09.372
I am ashamed to admit
I may have been one of them

29:09.456 --> 29:10.874
before I met your daughter.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.334
I think now they're opening their eyes.

29:13.418 --> 29:17.380
They're realizing that people
who just regard us as the other group

29:17.464 --> 29:20.300
and not as fellow Americans,
they just don't deserve our vote.

29:22.218 --> 29:23.178
Amen.

29:23.887 --> 29:26.806
You'd certainly have our vote,
if we could vote.

29:26.890 --> 29:30.393
Puerto Ricans have been US citizens
for the past 100 years,

29:30.477 --> 29:31.519
but we still can't vote.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.897
The government takes our money
but not our ballot.

29:33.980 --> 29:36.149
It's one of the greatest failings
of our current system,

29:36.232 --> 29:38.193
and one I promise not to forget if we win.

29:41.696 --> 29:42.697
We are late.

29:43.656 --> 29:46.075
Aaron needs to go win over some people
who actually can vote.

29:48.411 --> 29:51.039
-It was such a pleasure meeting you.
-It was wonderful to meet you.

29:53.291 --> 29:55.376
-I am mortified.
-About what?

29:55.460 --> 29:59.589
-I had no idea my mom had contacted you.
-It was great. Your mother's great.

30:00.465 --> 30:01.883
How are you? Here, have a seat.

30:04.427 --> 30:05.303
Um...

30:06.805 --> 30:09.015
I just wanted to apologize in person.

30:09.098 --> 30:11.726
Stephanie, you don't owe me an apology.
You don't owe me anything.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.812
I owe you two apologies.

30:13.895 --> 30:15.855
I was a total jerk for ghosting you.

30:15.939 --> 30:19.234
No, your mother mentioned
how busy college has been keeping you.

30:19.317 --> 30:21.694
It is, but that wasn't the reason.

30:21.778 --> 30:24.948
-You don't have to--
-My parents got divorced last year.

30:25.907 --> 30:28.910
It's not like I was five,
but I took it really hard.

30:29.911 --> 30:31.996
I took a DNA test out of spite.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.333
Out of some silly fantasy
that they weren't my real parents.

30:36.626 --> 30:40.255
I didn't ever think
that I'd be half right.

30:40.338 --> 30:42.924
Oh, my God.
What a terrible way to find out.

30:43.007 --> 30:45.510
-They never told you?
-Nope. It was a head trip.

30:46.344 --> 30:48.179
Then I clicked to see
if you were in the database,

30:48.263 --> 30:50.265
again, never dreaming that you would be,

30:51.599 --> 30:52.809
but you were.

30:53.893 --> 30:57.480
And then you wrote to me,
never dreaming that I'd answer.

30:58.606 --> 31:00.066
But I did.

31:00.775 --> 31:03.903
I had a small freak-out
after every one of those steps.

31:05.780 --> 31:08.366
The last one resulted in radio silence.

31:10.368 --> 31:13.288
I'm really sorry
that I dragged you into this.

31:13.371 --> 31:14.497
It wasn't fair to you.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.918
This is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

31:20.795 --> 31:21.713
[chuckles]

31:21.796 --> 31:24.841
And you really should fill out
that White House internship application.

31:24.924 --> 31:26.175
You have connections.

31:26.259 --> 31:28.136
You don't need
to do that for me, seriously.

31:28.219 --> 31:30.138
The White House would be
lucky to have you.

31:31.973 --> 31:34.726
That would be amazing. Thank you.

31:35.476 --> 31:36.477
Oh.

31:41.608 --> 31:44.986
-Be right with you, Mars.
-Take your time, Garrett.

31:45.069 --> 31:47.780
I appreciate you
squeezing me in like this.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.324
[Detwiler] If you're looking
for a donation,

31:49.407 --> 31:50.909
I'm already backing another candidate.

31:50.992 --> 31:53.077
No, I'm not here to ask for anything.

31:53.161 --> 31:54.537
Are you here on behalf of the president?

31:54.621 --> 31:56.080
Nope. It's personal.

31:56.164 --> 31:58.416
[Detwiler] Well,
those are my only two guesses.

31:58.499 --> 31:59.542
Why do you need to see me?

32:01.502 --> 32:04.088
I wanted to tell you
what a piece of shit you are.

32:05.089 --> 32:05.965
Excuse me?

32:06.049 --> 32:08.760
And to gloat about the fact
that you've been kicked off

32:08.843 --> 32:11.179
the board of FlagKind,
and the board of directors--

32:11.262 --> 32:14.641
If you think I give a flying piss
about stepping down from a few boards,

32:14.724 --> 32:16.643
you're even more insane
than you look right now.

32:16.726 --> 32:19.395
Do you remember that exposé
about your corrupt practices

32:19.479 --> 32:22.649
-when you were FDA commissioner?
-Thanks for stopping by, Mars.

32:22.732 --> 32:26.361
I wanted to let you know
that it was me who exposed you.

32:29.447 --> 32:30.573
Gotcha.

32:36.079 --> 32:39.666
How's your addict wife, Mars? Hmm?

32:41.709 --> 32:43.878
That's what this is all about, right?

32:44.921 --> 32:46.798
I read she went into rehab.

32:48.883 --> 32:51.386
Because of a drug that never
should've been on the market,

32:51.469 --> 32:53.554
because you pushed it through.

32:53.638 --> 32:56.891
It's easier to blame me
than your pathetic junkie wife, isn't it?

32:56.975 --> 33:00.895
You should be in jail because of your part
in the opioid crisis.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.982
Well, that's never gonna happen, Mars.

33:05.441 --> 33:07.068
Now, get out.

33:12.991 --> 33:16.995
And I do have to know, though,
since you are Moss' biggest donor,

33:17.078 --> 33:19.038
was he part of the bioterror plot?

33:19.789 --> 33:20.999
What kind of question is that?

33:22.458 --> 33:24.836
-Yeah, you get out of my office!
-Okay.

33:26.295 --> 33:27.880
[agent] Step away from the computer.

33:27.964 --> 33:30.633
-[Mars] What's going on?
-Sir, we need you to clear the area.

33:32.135 --> 33:34.262
What the hell is happening?

33:34.345 --> 33:35.930
They flipped Brunton.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.932
Detwiler funded the whole thing.

33:41.310 --> 33:44.981
Garrett, if you can't afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.

33:45.940 --> 33:47.108
Asshole.

33:49.569 --> 33:53.322
And should anyone need reminding,
simply take a coin out of your pocket.

33:53.406 --> 33:55.241
The principle and de facto motto

33:55.324 --> 33:57.869
on which this great nation was built
is printed right there.

33:57.952 --> 34:00.872
<i>E pluribus unum.</i> Out of many, one.

34:00.955 --> 34:01.998
[crowd cheering]

34:02.081 --> 34:04.834
Black, white, Latino, Asian,
we are all immigrants,

34:04.917 --> 34:06.461
or descendants of immigrants,

34:06.544 --> 34:08.463
and we are America!

34:09.255 --> 34:11.299
It's what made us
the greatest country on Earth,

34:11.382 --> 34:13.634
and it is what will carry us
into the future.

34:13.718 --> 34:17.096
God bless you, Houston.
God bless America.

34:17.180 --> 34:18.139
Thank you.

34:18.222 --> 34:20.224
[crowd cheering]

34:24.312 --> 34:26.481
You did great. I am so proud of you.

34:27.523 --> 34:29.817
What's wrong? Hey. Hey.

34:29.901 --> 34:31.235
Did something happen?

34:31.319 --> 34:33.654
I think Sasha should have been
out there with us.

34:33.738 --> 34:36.282
-I can't believe you did that to her.
-Penny, I'm sorry.

34:36.365 --> 34:38.409
You know how proud I am
of your Aunt Sasha.

34:38.493 --> 34:40.078
It doesn't look that way to me.

34:40.703 --> 34:43.581
-It looks like you're ashamed of her.
-Of course not. I...

34:44.248 --> 34:48.169
I felt that some of the people here
might not give her a very warm reception.

34:48.252 --> 34:50.338
Only because they don't know her.

34:50.421 --> 34:53.800
They'd change their minds if they met her.
You didn't give them the chance.

34:53.883 --> 34:55.426
-Penny, please.
-[Lorraine] Humongous news--

34:55.510 --> 34:57.678
-Can you just give us a minute?
-This is too good.

34:57.762 --> 35:00.223
-Detwiler was just arrested.
-That's Moss' biggest donor.

35:00.306 --> 35:01.599
Still think Moss wasn't involved?

35:01.682 --> 35:04.519
Obviously, we're gonna add a topper
to your next remarks.

35:04.602 --> 35:07.230
Ooh, I've gotta take this.
I'm gonna catch up with you.

35:07.980 --> 35:09.690
Come on, honey, let's go.

35:33.714 --> 35:35.716
[Myles] That's why this is gonna be
twice the normal price.

35:35.800 --> 35:37.760
Myles, honestly, I'm good for it.

35:37.844 --> 35:40.555
I will wire money into your account
tomorrow morning.

35:44.016 --> 35:45.351
Is this Pegasus?

35:45.434 --> 35:47.687
Actually, it's a good,
old-fashioned cell phone video

35:47.770 --> 35:49.647
taken from a hella pissed-off busboy.

35:49.730 --> 35:51.107
Unbelievable.

35:51.190 --> 35:54.485
This is worth more than everything
I've gotten from Pegasus put together.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.988
You could've saved me a bundle
if I'd known this was coming.

35:57.071 --> 35:59.490
-What will you do with it?
-Leak it to an outlet.

35:59.574 --> 36:02.702
<i>Mother Jones,</i> I think, seems good.
I gotta get back to Kirkman.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.254
Mr. President. A word?

36:14.380 --> 36:16.507
I've wanted to have a word with you
for quite some time.

36:16.591 --> 36:18.843
The only thing I wanna hear
from you is an apology.

36:18.926 --> 36:21.053
And all I need from you is an explanation.

36:21.137 --> 36:22.930
Smear campaign is one thing.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.641
You crossed a line when you accused me
of being a terrorist.

36:25.725 --> 36:27.268
-I haven't said that.
-No.

36:27.351 --> 36:31.147
No, you took the chicken shit route
and had your spokesgirl say it for you.

36:31.230 --> 36:34.650
Emily Rhodes hasn't released any statement
proclaiming your guilt or innocence.

36:34.734 --> 36:37.278
She's simply asking the questions
that everyone else is.

36:37.361 --> 36:39.530
The question that kept me up all night.
Were you?

36:39.614 --> 36:41.157
You know goddamn well
I had nothing to do with it--

36:41.240 --> 36:43.701
-I do not know that.
-Bullshit! You know me!

36:43.784 --> 36:46.204
I thought I did until you got into bed
with that racist,

36:46.287 --> 36:48.164
hate-spewing ideologue, Phil Brunton.

36:48.247 --> 36:50.541
Phil Brunton was
a brilliant Ivy League kid

36:50.625 --> 36:52.585
with his thumb
on the pulse of the heartland.

36:52.668 --> 36:54.337
I had no idea he had a screw loose.

36:54.420 --> 36:57.048
What the hell happened to you?
I used to respect you.

36:57.131 --> 36:59.759
You used to be a thoughtful,
compassionate Conservative.

36:59.842 --> 37:02.386
And how many of those unicorns
have you seen lately?

37:02.470 --> 37:05.640
No, sir. I shifted right
when my constituents did.

37:05.723 --> 37:07.892
And I think you've made
a gross miscalculation.

37:07.975 --> 37:09.977
The people you're pandering to
might be the most vocal,

37:10.061 --> 37:11.687
but they're not the majority
of your party.

37:11.771 --> 37:14.106
Son, you are sadly out of step
with the times.

37:14.190 --> 37:15.942
Well, Tuesday will tell.

37:16.025 --> 37:18.152
I've gone all-in for what I think
is right for the heart

37:18.236 --> 37:19.362
and majority of this country--

37:19.445 --> 37:21.697
Save the saccharine
for the yahoos at your next stop,

37:21.781 --> 37:24.158
and, please, don't stand there and tell me

37:24.242 --> 37:27.245
that you aren't flagrantly pandering
to the far left.

37:27.328 --> 37:30.498
-Picking Aaron Shore as your VP?
-He was the best candidate.

37:31.082 --> 37:34.210
You know, when you came out with
the announcement about your running mate,

37:34.293 --> 37:36.087
I said, "That boy has learned
to play the game."

37:36.170 --> 37:38.256
God damn it, Cornelius.
This is not a game.

37:38.339 --> 37:39.757
Of course it is!

37:41.592 --> 37:43.302
You hold yourself above politics,

37:44.220 --> 37:47.348
but the truth is you're every bit
as much a politician as I am.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.976
God help me if that's true.

37:52.270 --> 37:55.106
You know, I didn't think
you'd have the balls

37:55.189 --> 37:57.275
to pull your sister-in-law,
or whatever you call her,

37:57.358 --> 37:58.651
out of your programme.

38:00.069 --> 38:01.404
Smart move.

38:29.974 --> 38:31.475
[cell phone ringing]

38:40.818 --> 38:42.278

[Dontae] <i>Don't hang up.</i>
<i>You were right.</i>

38:44.655 --> 38:46.907
Lorraine definitely has a mole
in Moss' campaign.

38:46.991 --> 38:50.244
<i>It's Moss' digital guy.</i>
<i>His name is Myles.</i>

38:50.328 --> 38:52.788
-Dontae, I'm sorry, I--
<i>-This is way bigger than you thought.</i>

38:52.872 --> 38:54.749
If I heard what I think I just heard,

38:54.832 --> 38:57.960
the two of them are messing
with some seriously illegal shit.

38:58.044 --> 39:01.213
Like, beyond Watergate illegal.

39:01.297 --> 39:02.256
It's called Pegasus.

39:02.340 --> 39:05.384
<i>It's Israeli spy software</i>
<i>that lets you read text messages,</i>

39:05.468 --> 39:07.470
<i>-track calls, collect passwords...</i>
-Look, I'm sorry--

39:07.553 --> 39:11.265
<i>...and remotely turn on a device</i>
<i>to record without the owner's knowledge.</i>

39:11.349 --> 39:14.643
This is tech that is only supposed to be
available to governments to combat terror.

39:14.727 --> 39:16.812
<i>This is bad, Emily.</i>

39:18.105 --> 39:19.857
<i>End-of-the-road bad.</i>

39:19.940 --> 39:22.151
<i>-Are you at the campaign office?</i>
-No.

39:22.234 --> 39:23.152
Can you get there?

39:23.861 --> 39:25.446
I'm sorry, I can't.

39:25.529 --> 39:28.824
<i>Before we get in tonight,</i>
<i>you have to get onto Lorraine's computer.</i>

39:28.908 --> 39:30.826
See if she really has
the Pegasus software.

39:30.910 --> 39:32.661
<i>I don't know her password.</i>

39:32.745 --> 39:34.080
Not to be ageist,

39:34.163 --> 39:36.457
but people of a certain age
tend to keep it written down nearby.

39:37.416 --> 39:39.210
I saw her read it from
a Post-it in her top drawer.

39:39.293 --> 39:42.004
-I can't--
<i>-I'm not asking for me.</i>

39:42.088 --> 39:43.214
<i>It's for Kirkman.</i>

39:44.131 --> 39:46.467

39:47.176 --> 39:49.053
-Okay, I'll go. I'll go.
<i>-Thank you.</i>

39:49.136 --> 39:50.304
I gotta go.

40:01.649 --> 40:03.651
I'm only standing here today

40:03.734 --> 40:07.238
because of this amazing woman
by my side, Isabel Pardo.

40:07.321 --> 40:09.573
[crowd cheering]

40:15.079 --> 40:20.376
She has been my rock
since the very beginning of this journey.

40:21.627 --> 40:23.045
Thank you. Thank you, Isi.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.173
[crowd continues cheering]

40:27.550 --> 40:28.384
Uh...

40:29.427 --> 40:34.515
I know you have it ingrained in you
to vote blue or to vote red.

40:34.598 --> 40:36.559
But where has that gotten you?

40:37.476 --> 40:40.396
-Do you feel represented?
-[all] No!

40:40.479 --> 40:43.858
-Do you deserve to be represented? Yes.
-[all] Yes!

40:43.941 --> 40:46.026
Then break the cycle.

40:46.110 --> 40:47.903
Make a different choice.

40:47.987 --> 40:49.864
An Independent choice.

40:49.947 --> 40:51.991
Make history.

40:52.074 --> 40:58.372
Make this man
our first Latino vice president!

41:03.669 --> 41:05.212
[Aaron] Thank you.

41:09.633 --> 41:11.886
You may have just won Florida.

41:11.969 --> 41:13.053
I think you may have.

41:13.846 --> 41:17.349
Isi, we're pretty good at this, aren't we?

41:18.934 --> 41:20.686
You wanna give it another shot?

41:22.104 --> 41:25.941
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay?

41:26.525 --> 41:28.611
-All right. Yeah.
-I gotta go find my parents.

41:30.196 --> 41:31.322
Okay.

[Felix over phone] <i>Harper's office.</i>

41:39.497 --> 41:41.665
Hey, Felix, pull up
the <i>Mother Jones</i> website for Harper.

41:41.749 --> 41:44.502
Have him watch the video
in the lead story now.

41:48.214 --> 41:50.216
Felix, get me POTUS.

41:50.299 --> 41:53.427
I wanted to tell you that I'm sorry.
I was wrong.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.596
I should have let you introduce me.

41:55.679 --> 41:56.889
Easy to say now.

41:56.972 --> 41:59.099
[Tom] But I didn't realize how wrong I was

41:59.183 --> 42:02.686
until someone
who I have absolutely no respect for

42:02.770 --> 42:04.313
told me I was just like him.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.191
And he wasn't completely wrong.

42:07.858 --> 42:08.692
How so?

42:08.776 --> 42:12.071
What I did was
a purely calculated political move.

42:12.154 --> 42:13.948
It wasn't something
that I thought was right.

42:14.031 --> 42:17.409
And I didn't get into politics
to behave like a politician.

42:17.493 --> 42:20.120
I'm sorry. It'll never happen again.

42:20.204 --> 42:24.124
I didn't enjoy playing
the gracefully suffering trans woman.

42:24.208 --> 42:26.544
I promise not to do that again.

42:26.627 --> 42:28.587

-Excuse me.

42:29.713 --> 42:30.923
Yeah?

-[whispers] I'm sorry.
-We're cool.

42:36.679 --> 42:37.763
Okay.
