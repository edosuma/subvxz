04:02.309 --> 04:03.809
The thing that
really spoke to me

04:03.811 --> 04:06.378
was the idea of
emotional freedom.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.714
Like leaving yourself,
being free.

04:08.716 --> 04:12.284
'Cause most people aren't
in institutions, obviously,

04:12.286 --> 04:15.887
but we're all locked
up in some way.

04:15.889 --> 04:19.458
- So when...
- School is an institution.

04:19.459 --> 04:22.961
It's not an institution.

04:22.963 --> 04:27.332
But it's still a place
that we have to go,

04:27.334 --> 04:29.001
everyday,

04:29.003 --> 04:31.169
and it can feel like...

04:31.838 --> 04:33.739
you're stuck.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.440
Like you're not allowed
to be yourself

04:35.442 --> 04:37.776
all of the time, right?

04:39.712 --> 04:41.947
What are some other places
that can feel like that?

04:41.949 --> 04:44.149
- Sorry, Miss Stevens?
- Yes, Margot.

04:44.151 --> 04:45.517
Can we get back to the ending?

04:46.085 --> 04:49.888
Sure. Yes, the ending.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.090
You were saying that
when McMurphy has...

04:52.092 --> 04:53.659
What do you think?

04:55.728 --> 04:57.829
Excuse me?

04:58.765 --> 05:00.799
What did you think
of the ending?

05:01.467 --> 05:02.601
Nice try, man.

05:02.603 --> 05:04.102
- Calm down, I read it.
- Guys...

05:04.104 --> 05:06.305
Just like you read
<i>The Great Gatsby?</i>

05:06.307 --> 05:07.406
Guys!

05:07.408 --> 05:08.907
Why don't you just
watch the movie?

05:08.909 --> 05:11.510
Actually, watching movies aren't
really a safe way to cheat.

05:11.512 --> 05:12.778
Just 'cause someone doesn't talk

05:12.780 --> 05:14.313
every time they
feel like talking,

05:14.315 --> 05:15.847
doesn't mean they
didn't read the book.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.049
Guys!

05:18.651 --> 05:20.319
Done?

05:20.321 --> 05:21.887
Let's get back to the book.

05:22.555 --> 05:24.256
What did you think?

05:24.957 --> 05:26.425
Of the ending?

05:26.427 --> 05:27.893
Mm-hmm.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.162
I love it.

05:32.932 --> 05:34.299
This is what I wanna do.

05:34.301 --> 05:35.500
So I checked with
the front office,

05:35.502 --> 05:37.536
and they have the petty
cash all ready to go,

05:37.538 --> 05:38.603
and they double checked

05:38.605 --> 05:40.005
and all our permission
slips are in.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.807
So we're all set for
the drama competition.

05:41.809 --> 05:42.941
Thank you.

05:42.943 --> 05:43.942
You're welcome.

05:43.944 --> 05:45.610
And we're leaving after
third period, yes?

05:45.612 --> 05:46.845
That's the plan.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.380
And thank you for taking us.

05:48.382 --> 05:50.615
I had to ask three
other teachers

05:50.617 --> 05:52.517
before you volunteered to come.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.286
Billy?

06:04.263 --> 06:06.531
- Hi, Margot.
- Hi, Billy.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.602
Billy, when are we doing
the <i>Gats</i> make up?

06:11.237 --> 06:12.304
Shit!

06:12.306 --> 06:13.538
Margot?

06:13.540 --> 06:16.541
- Oh, right. See you both at...
- 12:00?

06:19.112 --> 06:20.379
First of all, no cursing.

06:20.381 --> 06:21.980
Second of all, did
you finish the book?

06:21.982 --> 06:22.982
Yes, I did.

06:24.283 --> 06:25.684
It's been two weeks.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.486
I don't wanna fail you.
What's going on?

06:27.488 --> 06:28.754
I'm just having trouble

06:28.756 --> 06:30.889
caring about a lot
of things right now.

06:31.657 --> 06:33.959
Are you talking to anyone?

06:34.961 --> 06:36.194
Hmm.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.597
"Anyone"?

06:39.432 --> 06:41.032
Are you?

06:42.502 --> 06:43.802
Just 'cause people
are the people

06:43.804 --> 06:45.036
you're supposed to talk to,

06:45.038 --> 06:46.571
it doesn't mean you
can talk to them.

07:02.121 --> 07:04.022
<i>So, just a few things
before you go.</i>

07:04.024 --> 07:07.793
I'm sure your kids are all caught
up in their class work, yes?

07:07.795 --> 07:09.361
Uh, why?

07:09.363 --> 07:11.163
They can't go on the trip if
they're missing assignments.

07:11.165 --> 07:12.097
School policy.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.932
I already spoke to
the other teachers.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.066
And so I'm just checking...

07:15.068 --> 07:16.768
Oh, yes. No. Of course.
Yeah, of course.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.237
Okay. Good, good.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.473
Our main concern is, uh,

07:21.475 --> 07:22.874
William Mitman.

07:22.876 --> 07:24.676
- Billy?
- Yeah, Billy.

07:24.678 --> 07:27.078
I don't know if you're
aware of his issues.

07:27.080 --> 07:30.015
But we wouldn't
be letting him go

07:30.017 --> 07:31.416
unless he was 100%.

07:31.418 --> 07:32.951
But Legal just
wants to make sure

07:32.953 --> 07:37.022
that I discuss this with you,
just to keep your eyes open.

07:37.024 --> 07:39.891
What he has is a
behavioral disorder.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.861
And he will be taking his
medication with him on the trip.

07:42.863 --> 07:47.232
He's allowed to administer
the medication himself.

07:47.234 --> 07:51.002
Between you and me, I
think there's just

07:51.471 --> 07:53.805
some tension at home,

07:53.807 --> 07:55.974
so they just wanna show
him a little trust

07:55.976 --> 07:57.742
by letting him go on this trip.

07:57.744 --> 08:01.847
But you have my number,
so if you need me, call.

08:38.217 --> 08:39.618
- Hey, Sam.
- Hey!

08:39.620 --> 08:41.820
Sweet ride, Miss S.

08:50.396 --> 08:51.463
Hi.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.765
I brought the test.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.167
You're taking it this weekend.
No excuses.

08:56.569 --> 08:57.869
Uh, what test?

08:57.871 --> 08:59.271
Take care of yourself, Margot.

08:59.273 --> 09:01.373
Oh, the <i>Gatsby</i> test? Why
didn't Billy take...

09:01.375 --> 09:04.075
- Margot.
- Sorry.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.343
Okay.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.346
Are you ready?

09:21.360 --> 09:25.497
♪

09:35.241 --> 09:36.808
What's that light?

09:37.810 --> 09:39.744
That? That thing's
been on forever.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.246
Wait, your warning light is on?

09:41.248 --> 09:42.614
It's nothing.

09:42.616 --> 09:45.684
Well, if it were nothing
it wouldn't be on.

09:45.686 --> 09:48.587
It's a really old
car, it kind of just

09:48.589 --> 09:49.854
does things sometimes.

09:49.856 --> 09:51.122
It just does things sometimes?

09:51.124 --> 09:52.691
Do you want us to
stop and deal with it

09:52.693 --> 09:54.492
even though we're
already running late?

10:00.166 --> 10:01.700
Well, on behalf of all of us,

10:01.702 --> 10:03.902
I would just like to say
how grateful we are

10:03.904 --> 10:05.670
that you're taking us
to the competition.

10:05.672 --> 10:08.773
I mean, since the school
cut our arts program,

10:08.775 --> 10:11.576
it's important to get
exposure wherever we can.

10:11.578 --> 10:13.812
Yeah, seriously.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.816
Don't you think it's
interesting, Miss Stevens,

10:17.818 --> 10:20.752
that we spend almost
every day together

10:20.754 --> 10:22.921
and we talk about so
many different things,

10:22.923 --> 10:26.057
but we don't really
know each other?

10:26.759 --> 10:29.260
I mean, not really.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.327
I wanna talk to you about life.

11:02.329 --> 11:05.530
It's just too difficult
to be alive, isn't it?

11:05.532 --> 11:06.898
And to try to function.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.900
There are all these
people to deal with.

11:08.902 --> 11:11.136
Like, when I was at
the supermarket,

11:11.138 --> 11:13.405
trying to buy a
can of tuna fish,

11:13.407 --> 11:15.907
and there was someone
standing right in front

11:15.909 --> 11:18.777
who wanted to reach out
and grab the tuna fish.

11:18.779 --> 11:21.780
And I waited a while
to see if they'd move,

11:21.782 --> 11:22.947
but they didn't.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.749
They were looking at
the tun fish, too,

11:24.751 --> 11:26.317
but they were taking
a really long time,

11:26.319 --> 11:28.620
and they're reading each
ingredient like they were...

11:30.424 --> 11:31.656
What was that?

11:31.658 --> 11:33.191
Shit.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.659
Oh, shit. Sorry.

11:34.661 --> 11:36.061
No, seriously. What was that?

11:36.063 --> 11:37.696
- I think it was the tire.
- Oh, my God!

11:37.698 --> 11:39.130
Fuck! Sorry. Shit.

11:39.132 --> 11:40.632
- Oh, my God!
- Sorry, sorry.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.008
Sam.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.877
Sam, your monologue was really
good so far, I'm sorry.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.245
It's Christopher Durang, right?

11:54.247 --> 11:55.814
I didn't think you knew
who Christopher...

11:55.816 --> 11:58.183
Guys! We're sitting on
the side of the road.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.050
Right.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.285
It was the warning
light, wasn't it?

12:00.287 --> 12:02.187
It wasn't the warning
light, Margot.

12:02.189 --> 12:02.921
Oh, Jesus!

12:02.923 --> 12:03.988
You guys, please.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.490
Guys, please, please.
Come on, stop.

12:05.492 --> 12:08.760
You are driving other people's
children in an unfit automobile.

12:08.762 --> 12:10.929
I'm sorry. I'm
really embarrassed.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.397
Why are you embarrassed?

12:12.399 --> 12:13.732
Because I am the asshole

12:13.734 --> 12:16.668
who ignores a big,
flashing orange light.

12:16.670 --> 12:18.269
You curse a lot.

12:18.271 --> 12:20.472
- I know.
- When we're at school...

12:20.474 --> 12:21.673
It's just a switch.

12:21.675 --> 12:23.141
Why isn't the switch on now?

12:23.143 --> 12:25.477
Because we're not at school.

12:26.278 --> 12:28.546
But, like, we are.

12:32.318 --> 12:33.952
Right.

12:34.153 --> 12:35.286
Okay.

13:01.914 --> 13:04.249
We're gonna be so late.

13:04.251 --> 13:07.418
I have to call the hotel.
I'm gonna call the hotel.

13:13.559 --> 13:16.060
Hi. This is Margot Jensen
from Franklin High School.

13:16.062 --> 13:17.595
Is this the front desk?

13:22.434 --> 13:23.768
Where do I...

13:23.770 --> 13:25.270
Where it says "signature".

13:25.272 --> 13:26.938
Oh.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.940
Make sure you get that
to your service station

13:28.942 --> 13:30.608
as soon as you possibly can.

13:30.610 --> 13:32.544
Drive too long on the spare...

13:32.546 --> 13:34.145
Right. Okay. Will do.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.381

Oh, gosh. Um...

16:37.230 --> 16:39.530
We did <i>The Glass Menagerie.</i>

16:40.632 --> 16:41.933
I loved that play.

16:41.935 --> 16:43.167
And who were you?

16:43.169 --> 16:44.435
I was Tom.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.404
I ended up playing boys a lot.

16:46.406 --> 16:47.405
Why?

16:47.407 --> 16:50.441
I don't know. I... I was tall.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.976
I don't really have hips.

17:03.990 --> 17:05.289
So are we excited to see

17:05.290 --> 17:06.357

17:06.358 --> 17:08.358
- Pretty interesting...
- Oh.

17:08.361 --> 17:12.130
Man. There was this...
There was this one time...

17:12.132 --> 17:14.365
What?

17:14.367 --> 17:16.367
Gosh, I haven't thought
about this in years.

17:16.368 --> 17:20.070
We were doing <i>Taming
of the Shrew.</i>

17:20.073 --> 17:22.040
And I played Petruchio.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.909
And in the last scene,
on the last night...

17:24.911 --> 17:26.676
Petruchio is the main character.

17:26.679 --> 17:27.878
Right. Sorry. But...

17:27.881 --> 17:30.014
Petruchio is this guy who's
in love with this girl...

17:30.016 --> 17:31.215
Kate.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.017
And in the last scene,
the girl playing Kate,

17:33.019 --> 17:35.853
this girl... Gillian.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.890
She... kisses me.

17:38.892 --> 17:42.627
We'd been doing it with this...
This stupid hug.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.295
Because it was that
kind of school.

17:44.297 --> 17:48.666
So I go in for the stupid
hug, and she just...

17:48.668 --> 17:50.701
turns her head and...

17:52.004 --> 17:53.604
And kisses me.

17:55.174 --> 17:56.741
Really kisses me.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.944
And I remember

17:59.946 --> 18:03.548
thinking why didn't we do
this in the first place?

18:03.550 --> 18:05.750
These two people are in love.

18:05.752 --> 18:09.120
And then it hit me
that my teachers,

18:09.122 --> 18:11.055
my mother,

18:11.057 --> 18:13.458
my grandmother and...

18:13.460 --> 18:16.794
And the boy I liked, Thomas...

18:16.796 --> 18:21.399
O'Toole, are all out
there watching me

18:21.401 --> 18:23.968
make out with Gillian Cooke.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.703
God! That's crazy.

18:25.705 --> 18:26.704
What happened?

18:26.706 --> 18:29.574
We had to go to the
principal's office.

18:29.576 --> 18:32.510
But didn't you tell
them it was her fault?

18:34.046 --> 18:35.446
No.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.715
Why not?

18:38.183 --> 18:40.384
I don't know.

18:40.386 --> 18:42.720
It didn't feel like
it was her fault.

18:43.989 --> 18:45.256
I totally get it.

18:45.258 --> 18:48.392
And if we... One of us
had actually been a boy,

18:48.394 --> 18:51.395
we wouldn't have got into...
trouble at all.

18:51.397 --> 18:52.730
They wouldn't have cared.

18:52.732 --> 18:54.772
They would have clapped and
thought you were dating.

18:55.367 --> 18:57.268
I never did another play.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.537
Still good on that wine?

18:59.539 --> 19:01.239
Are you trying to get me drunk?

19:04.109 --> 19:07.578
Yeah. No, I'm good. Thank you.

19:07.580 --> 19:10.148
- No more for...
- Can you...

19:10.150 --> 19:11.449

19:11.451 --> 19:13.885
Well, we should get going.
We're gonna be late.

19:14.786 --> 19:16.387
Again.

19:19.458 --> 19:22.493
Most of you will be eliminated.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.729
And it will be difficult.

19:24.731 --> 19:28.366
So much of acting is
about the struggle.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.967
But some of you,

19:29.969 --> 19:32.470
the truly talented few,

19:32.472 --> 19:35.273
will earn the right to
stand on this stage

19:35.275 --> 19:36.841
and be heard by all.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.977

will experience...

32:30.381 --> 32:31.982
So what made Margot
think I was...

32:31.984 --> 32:33.951
That story you told,

32:33.953 --> 32:35.519
about the girl kissing you.

32:36.321 --> 32:38.422
She just got it
into her head that,

32:38.424 --> 32:41.024
'cause you didn't rat
the other girl out,

32:41.026 --> 32:42.526
you must be a lesbian.

32:43.628 --> 32:44.661
Oh.

32:44.663 --> 32:46.863
I told her that's
not what you meant.

32:46.865 --> 32:48.332
Ugh.

32:52.737 --> 32:54.438
What did I mean?

32:56.174 --> 32:57.894
- Is that a teacher question?
- No.

33:00.011 --> 33:01.945
No. You think you know what I meant.
Tell me.

33:01.947 --> 33:03.747
Tell me.

33:07.318 --> 33:08.285
Tell me.

33:08.287 --> 33:09.886
Yeah...

33:11.055 --> 33:13.457
You felt like she was
doing the right thing.

33:15.026 --> 33:16.593
Kissing you.

33:38.216 --> 33:39.716
I'm not...

33:41.753 --> 33:43.720
A lesbian.

33:43.722 --> 33:45.922
Not that there is
anything wrong with that.

33:47.558 --> 33:48.892
Sam's gay.

33:50.461 --> 33:51.828
I know.

33:51.830 --> 33:54.197
He came out to me last year.

33:55.233 --> 33:57.434
- It's pretty cool.
- It's cool.

34:03.674 --> 34:06.443
He has a lot of friends.

34:08.212 --> 34:10.213
He's easy to be around.

34:14.018 --> 34:15.918
I don't really have
a lot of friends.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.456
I don't either.

34:20.458 --> 34:22.324
- You don't?
- Mm-mmm.

34:24.962 --> 34:27.630
I'm... tough.

34:29.766 --> 34:31.967
Me, too. Uh...

34:36.174 --> 34:38.241
How are we talking about this?

34:40.277 --> 34:41.645
I don't know.

35:02.733 --> 35:05.102
Where were you guys?

35:05.104 --> 35:07.838
You better hope they don't kick
you out of the competition.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.239
What is he talking about?

35:09.241 --> 35:12.242
Rehearsals. He
missed rehearsals.

35:12.244 --> 35:16.046
No, no. He said he didn't
have to be there till...

35:16.048 --> 35:17.514
Billy.

35:18.216 --> 35:19.783
I better go.

35:20.284 --> 35:22.252
Where were you?

35:22.254 --> 35:24.321
I left a note under your door.

35:24.323 --> 35:25.422
I talked to the front desk.

35:25.424 --> 35:26.990
I didn't get it.

35:30.161 --> 35:31.595
I'm sorry.

35:32.530 --> 35:34.064
You really think
they'll kick him out?

35:34.066 --> 35:36.867
They take things
pretty seriously.

35:52.817 --> 35:53.984
So what did she say?

35:53.986 --> 35:55.152
I'm fine.

35:55.154 --> 35:56.653
Of course you are.

35:58.122 --> 36:01.024
All right. Welcome to round one.

36:02.193 --> 36:03.393
It's a big day today.

36:03.395 --> 36:06.730
Today we learn what's
you, what's me,

36:06.732 --> 36:07.931
and what's us.

36:07.933 --> 36:12.402
Okay. First up is the group
from Franklin High School.

36:12.404 --> 36:15.038
Uh, let's start
with Margot Jensen.

36:21.712 --> 36:24.414
Hi, I'm Margot Jensen from
Franklin High School.

36:24.416 --> 36:26.216
And today I'll be performing

36:26.218 --> 36:27.684
one of Blanche
DuBois' monologues

36:27.686 --> 36:30.453
from Tennessee Williams' <i>A
Streetcar Named Desire.</i>

36:36.627 --> 36:39.930
When I was 16, I made
the discovery...

36:41.566 --> 36:42.899
Love...

36:44.235 --> 36:47.904
All at once and much,
much too completely.

36:49.507 --> 36:51.641
But I was unlucky.

37:20.171 --> 37:23.039
Okay, okay.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.774
That's okay. That's okay.

37:25.142 --> 37:26.443
We're safe.

37:26.445 --> 37:31.047
Next up we have William Mitman.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.668
Margot?

37:53.504 --> 37:55.038
I'm not here.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.907
I know.

37:57.909 --> 37:59.743
Can I talk to you anyway?

38:02.280 --> 38:04.147
I guess so.

38:12.790 --> 38:16.192
I just want you to know that
it's totally okay to be upset.

38:16.194 --> 38:18.194
That was humiliating.

38:18.196 --> 38:20.397
It was, wasn't it?

38:20.399 --> 38:22.899
Are you supposed to say that?

38:22.901 --> 38:24.467
Would you rather I lied?

38:25.336 --> 38:26.903
I guess not.

38:27.905 --> 38:30.373
It was humiliating.

38:30.375 --> 38:33.176
And it sucks you worked
so hard and forgot.

38:34.178 --> 38:35.845
But you know what else?

38:37.014 --> 38:38.548
It's gonna be okay.

38:40.217 --> 38:42.786
Not today maybe, or...

38:43.387 --> 38:44.521
Or even tomorrow.

38:44.523 --> 38:46.556
But there will be
a day when this

38:47.024 --> 38:48.525
is okay.

38:49.960 --> 38:54.197
The worst part is I knew
I was gonna be terrible.

38:54.199 --> 38:56.032
Then why'd you do it?

38:56.034 --> 38:57.267
I don't know.

38:59.036 --> 39:01.604
I thought maybe I wasn't
as bad as I thought,

39:01.606 --> 39:03.306
or something would click today.

39:03.308 --> 39:06.209
But I am just not
a good actress.

39:09.547 --> 39:11.614
Well, what are you good at?

39:12.183 --> 39:13.516
School.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.685
And organizing things.

39:15.687 --> 39:17.687
That's true.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.723
You organized all of this.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.491
And I got Billy to come.

39:21.493 --> 39:23.193
Well, that's great.

39:23.195 --> 39:25.595
He's so talented.

39:25.597 --> 39:28.198
It'll be really good for
the school if he won.

39:28.200 --> 39:30.100
What do you mean?

39:30.102 --> 39:31.601
I think, maybe if he wins,

39:31.603 --> 39:33.737
the school might give some
money back to the arts program

39:33.739 --> 39:36.506
and we could do a
real play again.

39:36.508 --> 39:38.241
The school won't even
pay for this trip.

39:38.243 --> 39:39.776
This is our last chance.

39:39.778 --> 39:42.712
What do you mean the
school wouldn't pay?

39:44.915 --> 39:45.982
Um...

39:48.719 --> 39:50.253
Sam and Billy don't know this,

39:50.255 --> 39:52.856
but my parents paid
for this trip.

39:54.925 --> 39:56.092
I didn't even know.

39:56.094 --> 39:58.828
Will you... Just please
don't tell them.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.864
Of course not.

40:05.169 --> 40:07.804
Maybe that's one of
your gifts, Margot.

40:08.806 --> 40:10.640
And if you're right,

40:10.642 --> 40:13.109
you will be responsible
for bringing the arts

40:13.111 --> 40:14.844
back to our school.

40:24.855 --> 40:27.657
Are your jeans touching
the toilet seat?

40:28.259 --> 40:29.592
Yeah.

40:30.828 --> 40:32.028
Gross.

40:33.330 --> 40:34.998
I'm not gay.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.600
I can't believe
he told you that.

40:44.876 --> 40:47.343
I'm really sorry I missed
your monologues today.

40:47.345 --> 40:51.481
But I'm really proud of
you guys for moving on.

40:51.483 --> 40:52.949
Thanks, Margot.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.451
Yeah, thanks.

40:54.453 --> 40:55.852
I can't wait to see
them tomorrow.

40:55.854 --> 40:59.956
Speaking of which,
I am so nervous.

40:59.958 --> 41:00.958
Aren't you?

41:01.759 --> 41:03.359
I get nervous sometimes.

41:03.594 --> 41:04.928
Remember?

41:05.496 --> 41:08.698
Oh, right. Yeah. Sometimes.

41:08.700 --> 41:10.400
Hey, your food should
be out in a minute.

41:10.402 --> 41:11.968
Sorry for the wait.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.536
Another one? Yes?

41:13.538 --> 41:15.438
Oh, uh, no.

41:15.440 --> 41:16.840
No, thank you.

41:16.842 --> 41:18.575
Can I get another Diet Coke?

41:18.577 --> 41:20.009
Coming right up.

41:21.946 --> 41:24.113
You should totally
give him your number.

41:24.115 --> 41:25.315
Excuse me?

41:25.317 --> 41:26.516
He's been flirting with you.

41:26.518 --> 41:29.285
No, no. He has not been.

41:30.654 --> 41:32.188
And even if he has been,

41:32.190 --> 41:34.791
that's not a reason to give your
telephone number to a stranger.

41:34.793 --> 41:35.892
Unless he's cute.

41:35.894 --> 41:37.627
No, that is... That is not a...

41:37.629 --> 41:39.262
Do you have a boyfriend?

41:39.264 --> 41:41.264
- Why are you asking me that?
- So that's a no?

41:41.266 --> 41:42.432
Margot.

41:42.434 --> 41:44.234
- What?
- Seriously?

41:44.236 --> 41:45.335
Leave Rachel alone.

41:45.337 --> 41:46.870
- "Rachel"?
- Wow.

41:46.872 --> 41:47.871
What?

41:47.873 --> 41:49.606
Why did you call me that?

41:49.608 --> 41:51.140
Feels weird to call
you Miss Stevens.

41:51.142 --> 41:53.643
Well, it shouldn't. It
shouldn't feel weird.

41:53.645 --> 41:55.345
We've been spending so
much time together.

41:55.347 --> 41:56.813
As Miss Stevens.

42:03.087 --> 42:04.320
Phones.

42:04.322 --> 42:06.456
- What?
- Phones.

42:06.458 --> 42:08.157
On the table.

42:09.260 --> 42:11.261
People don't like it
when you're having

42:11.263 --> 42:12.795
more than one conversation.

42:15.132 --> 42:16.132
I'm sorry.

42:36.353 --> 42:37.921
I'm gonna take a break.

42:39.623 --> 42:41.758
I will see you guys later.

43:24.702 --> 43:26.336
Where are your kids?

43:26.971 --> 43:29.038
They're in their rooms.

43:33.911 --> 43:37.447
I guess I know what kind of
teacher you are now, don't I?

43:40.184 --> 43:41.985
Hey, look, um...

43:44.054 --> 43:45.154
Ugh!

43:46.156 --> 43:47.890
Last night was, um...

43:49.727 --> 43:52.495
You know, I'm married, so...

43:52.497 --> 43:53.997
So now you're married?

43:58.602 --> 44:00.803
I'm sorry. I...

44:08.278 --> 44:09.545
You knew I was married.

44:09.547 --> 44:10.980
Right. But now it matters?

44:13.450 --> 44:16.185
Look, um, the thing is, uh...

44:16.887 --> 44:19.222
All I really want is to

44:19.857 --> 44:21.924
finish my mini Jack Daniels

44:22.626 --> 44:24.527
and maybe this $14 movie.

44:25.362 --> 44:27.363
And then tomorrow,
I'm gonna go home

44:27.365 --> 44:29.232
and get in bed with my wife.

45:27.791 --> 45:29.392
Uh, hang on.

45:38.769 --> 45:41.003
Just a sec. Sorry.

45:49.546 --> 45:52.181
Coming.

45:59.156 --> 46:00.556
Hi.

46:01.492 --> 46:03.493
I'm sorry, Miss Stevens.

46:04.895 --> 46:06.529
It's been a weird
couple of days.

46:08.499 --> 46:10.833
Are you okay?

46:10.835 --> 46:13.035
- What?
- I don't know. You...

46:14.271 --> 46:15.438
No, I'm...

46:15.440 --> 46:16.839
I don't know.

46:16.841 --> 46:18.775
You seem like...

46:18.777 --> 46:20.409
- you're not okay.
- I'm fine.

46:22.980 --> 46:24.614
I brought you something.

46:29.586 --> 46:31.320
'Cause you missed dinner.

46:33.157 --> 46:36.459
- Thought you might be hungry.
- Thank you.

46:39.830 --> 46:42.165
You should go back to your room.

46:42.933 --> 46:45.001
- Okay.
- Okay.

46:46.770 --> 46:48.704
What?

46:48.706 --> 46:50.907
What? My hand...

46:50.909 --> 46:52.742
- Miss Stevens, I can't...
- Billy.

46:52.744 --> 46:55.745
I can't... I feel an urge
to knock on people's doors.

46:55.747 --> 46:57.313
Billy. Enough, Billy.

46:57.781 --> 46:59.115
Billy!

46:59.750 --> 47:01.184
Billy.

47:01.385 --> 47:02.985
Billy!

47:03.687 --> 47:04.887
Billy!

47:04.889 --> 47:06.389
Go back to your room.

47:07.257 --> 47:09.125
People are trying to sleep.
Billy!

47:09.127 --> 47:10.927
You're right. We shouldn't
be in the hallway.

47:10.929 --> 47:12.595
- We should probably go inside.
- Billy! No...

47:12.597 --> 47:14.330
Ugh! Billy...

47:18.669 --> 47:20.236
What are you doing?

47:24.241 --> 47:25.808
Why are you doing this, Billy?

47:25.810 --> 47:27.543
You love asking that question.

47:27.545 --> 47:28.811
Excuse me?

47:28.813 --> 47:30.379
I'm just jumping on the bed.

47:31.481 --> 47:33.082
Don't be sad.

47:33.084 --> 47:35.818
Don't be sad. Don't be sad.

47:35.820 --> 47:37.053
I'm not.

47:37.055 --> 47:38.788
- Don't be sad.
- I'm not. Billy, I'm not.

47:38.790 --> 47:40.223
Don't be sad. Don't be sad.

47:40.225 --> 47:42.325
- I'm not. I'm not.
- Don't be sad.

48:13.857 --> 48:15.191
Yeah.

48:15.893 --> 48:17.293
That's a good jump.

48:26.103 --> 48:28.271
Excuse me, excuse me.

49:06.677 --> 49:08.344
It's quite cold out here.

49:09.246 --> 49:10.846
Here. Take my sweatshirt.

49:10.848 --> 49:12.481
- No.
- Why?

49:12.483 --> 49:13.816
No.

49:20.557 --> 49:21.857
Thank you.

49:40.677 --> 49:42.178
So...

49:43.280 --> 49:45.614
Do you have a boyfriend, or...

49:51.888 --> 49:53.389
No.

49:55.926 --> 49:57.593
I don't have a boyfriend.

50:03.233 --> 50:05.568
You ever had your heart broken?

50:10.507 --> 50:11.774
Yeah.

50:14.277 --> 50:15.945
By who?

50:20.083 --> 50:21.584
When my mom died.

50:31.094 --> 50:33.763
You thought I was gonna
tell you a story about...

50:34.564 --> 50:37.199
some horrible guy
who's ruined...

50:39.236 --> 50:40.870
men for me forever?

50:44.775 --> 50:46.208
When?

50:47.244 --> 50:48.711
A year ago.

50:54.351 --> 50:55.985
Tell me about her.

51:02.492 --> 51:05.861
Tell you about her? How can I...

51:06.596 --> 51:08.264
Um...

51:11.234 --> 51:12.902
How can I tell you about her?

51:14.004 --> 51:15.838
I don't know, you just...

51:16.740 --> 51:19.608
pick somewhere and start.

51:21.711 --> 51:23.646
And keep going.

51:33.123 --> 51:34.690
You wanna hear about my mom?

51:35.625 --> 51:36.792
Mm-hmm.

51:38.962 --> 51:40.396
Okay.

51:44.034 --> 51:47.403
She... Uh...

51:49.739 --> 51:51.574
She drove a...

51:53.210 --> 51:55.578
blue Volvo station wagon.

52:00.083 --> 52:05.521
And she always listened
to the oldies.

52:07.924 --> 52:09.525
Um...

52:13.797 --> 52:15.598
She was an actress.

52:20.670 --> 52:22.872
She did this...

52:22.874 --> 52:25.708
This big movie when she
was younger, and then...

52:27.344 --> 52:28.677
And then she had me.

52:28.679 --> 52:31.881
It was just the... It
was just the two of us.

52:32.916 --> 52:34.817
And the acting wasn't...

52:36.019 --> 52:39.054
Wasn't enough for two, so
she had to get a real job.

52:40.924 --> 52:42.324
Um...

52:44.161 --> 52:46.729
And then, when I got
old enough, she...

52:48.732 --> 52:53.235
She started doing
plays after work.

52:53.237 --> 52:55.037
And...

52:57.407 --> 52:59.675
And I would go...

53:00.911 --> 53:02.778
I would go watch them.

53:05.715 --> 53:09.618
And there was this, um...
This one play that she did,

53:12.589 --> 53:14.757
I completely forgot
that I was...

53:16.326 --> 53:17.893
watching my mother.

53:19.429 --> 53:21.397
I was just...

53:24.367 --> 53:26.435
I was just watching this...

53:28.638 --> 53:30.005
This woman.

53:30.941 --> 53:33.409
And all the other

53:35.011 --> 53:37.546
people on stage were...

53:37.548 --> 53:39.748
They were men, and they were...

53:41.885 --> 53:43.652
They were all terrible.

53:44.554 --> 53:46.021
And she was just...

53:48.959 --> 53:51.627
holding them all...

53:53.129 --> 53:54.763
together.

53:54.765 --> 53:56.565
Holding them...

53:58.034 --> 54:00.035
Holding them up.

54:04.507 --> 54:06.408
And then this, um...

54:07.043 --> 54:09.378
One of the guys had this line

54:09.380 --> 54:11.714
that makes her...

54:19.422 --> 54:22.891
That makes her character
laugh, and...

54:31.968 --> 54:34.169
And then there she was.

55:17.781 --> 55:21.583
You have to go. You have to...

55:26.022 --> 55:27.256
You have to go.

55:27.258 --> 55:28.557
What are you talking about?

55:28.559 --> 55:30.259
You have to go. Billy,
you have to go.

55:30.261 --> 55:31.393
What are you talking about?

55:31.395 --> 55:32.594
It's time to go.

55:32.596 --> 55:33.996
- It's time for you to go.
- What?

55:33.998 --> 55:36.165
Come on, you have to go.

55:37.300 --> 55:38.667
Billy...

55:38.669 --> 55:41.770
What? What?

55:43.540 --> 55:46.175
I need you to go. Come on.

55:46.177 --> 55:47.509
Come on.

55:48.445 --> 55:50.212
Why?

55:50.214 --> 55:52.881
Billy, please. Please, Billy.

55:55.485 --> 55:57.186
Go. I need you to
go to your room.

55:57.921 --> 56:00.155
- Go to your room. Come on.
- Why?

56:05.462 --> 56:07.696
Why are you making me go?

56:10.400 --> 56:12.568
Billy...

56:15.439 --> 56:18.207
- Uh, yeah?
- Miss Stevens.

56:18.209 --> 56:20.142
Miss Stevens.

56:25.515 --> 56:27.416
I don't know where Billy...

56:27.418 --> 56:28.650
Hi, Sam.

56:28.652 --> 56:30.085
Why are you here?

56:31.955 --> 56:34.123
I locked myself out
of that room again.

56:34.125 --> 56:35.858
I couldn't find you and
I was too embarrassed

56:35.860 --> 56:39.027
to go downstairs and ask
for a new key again. So...

56:39.029 --> 56:41.997
Miss Stevens is holding me up.
But I was just on my way back.

56:41.999 --> 56:43.799
- What's up?
- Can I come in?

56:43.801 --> 56:46.668
The boy I met, the one
I've been texting.

56:46.670 --> 56:48.570
Well, he texted that he
wanted to hang out tonight,

56:48.572 --> 56:50.906
so Margot and I found him
in the parking lot...

56:50.908 --> 56:53.175
What were you doing
in the parking lot?

56:54.444 --> 56:55.844
Sorry, Miss Stevens.

56:55.846 --> 56:57.946
Miss Stevens?

57:01.618 --> 57:03.619
Oh. Hi, Billy.

57:03.621 --> 57:05.621
- Is Sam...
- I'm in here.

57:07.323 --> 57:08.657
Why did you leave?

57:08.659 --> 57:10.092
Sean sucks.

57:10.094 --> 57:12.428
What... What are you all doing

57:12.430 --> 57:13.829
out of your rooms?

57:13.831 --> 57:14.831
Can I?

57:15.899 --> 57:18.434
Uh... Yes.

57:18.436 --> 57:19.468
I didn't say anything

57:19.470 --> 57:20.769
'cause I knew you were into him.

57:20.771 --> 57:22.805
But, um, I kinda had a feeling.

57:22.807 --> 57:25.174
Yeah. Mm-hmm. Sean
is an asshole.

57:25.508 --> 57:27.075
Sorry.

57:27.077 --> 57:28.744
And this is a theater
competition,

57:28.746 --> 57:31.013
so I didn't think that I'd
have to deal with this shit.

57:31.015 --> 57:32.015
Sorry.

57:33.017 --> 57:36.552
I mean, I guess I thought
that I could meet someone.

57:36.554 --> 57:38.320
You know?

57:38.322 --> 57:39.955
Sorry.

57:46.796 --> 57:48.363
I didn't say this,

57:50.166 --> 57:52.134
but most people suck, Sam.

57:53.803 --> 57:55.070
They do.

57:55.805 --> 57:59.408
Some of them are wonderful.

58:00.410 --> 58:02.177
But mostly they're not.

58:03.513 --> 58:05.848
And the weirdest
part is it is...

58:07.183 --> 58:08.650
surprising...

58:09.219 --> 58:10.819
every single time.

58:12.755 --> 58:14.256
But I am here for you.

58:15.024 --> 58:16.225
Me, too.

58:16.227 --> 58:18.694
We are all here...

59:06.042 --> 59:09.211
♪

59:32.402 --> 59:34.403
You're gonna hear the truth.

59:36.439 --> 59:38.106
What you are,

59:39.075 --> 59:41.009
and what I am.

59:43.313 --> 59:46.848
We never told the truth for
ten minutes in this house.

59:47.951 --> 59:49.918
Well, hear this, Willy.

59:51.287 --> 59:52.854
This is me.

59:55.258 --> 59:58.060
You wanna know why I had no
address for three months?

59:59.696 --> 01:00:01.897
It's cause I stole a
suit in Kansas City,

01:00:01.899 --> 01:00:03.265
and I was in jail.

01:00:05.935 --> 01:00:09.304
I stole myself out of every
good job since high school.

01:00:09.306 --> 01:00:10.839
And I never got anywhere.

01:00:11.908 --> 01:00:15.043
Because you blew me
so full of hot air,

01:00:15.045 --> 01:00:18.180
I could never stand taking
orders from anybody.

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:20.515
That's whose fault it is.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:25.120
It's goddamn time you
heard that, Pop.

01:00:28.291 --> 01:00:30.792
I ran down 11 flights

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:33.462
with a pen in my hand today.

01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:36.765
Suddenly I stopped, you hear me?

01:00:36.767 --> 01:00:39.368
And in the middle of
that office building...

01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:41.103
Do you hear this?

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:46.375
I stopped in the
middle of the building

01:00:47.076 --> 01:00:48.810
and I saw...

01:00:50.513 --> 01:00:52.147
the sky.

01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:56.718
I saw all the things that
I love in this world.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:59.821
The work and the food.

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:02.591
The time to just sit and smoke.

01:01:03.861 --> 01:01:05.927
I looked at the pen

01:01:05.929 --> 01:01:07.863
and I thought to myself,

01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:12.134
"What the hell am I
grabbing this for, huh?

01:01:12.136 --> 01:01:15.671
Why am I trying to become
what I don't want to be?

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:17.739
What am I doing in an office,

01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:21.843
making a contemptuous,
begging fool of myself,

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:24.780
when all that I
want is out there,

01:01:24.782 --> 01:01:28.083
waiting for me the second
I say I know who I am!"

01:01:28.085 --> 01:01:30.318
Why can't I say that, Willy?

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.454
Pop, look at me.

01:01:32.456 --> 01:01:33.889
I'm a dime a dozen,

01:01:34.891 --> 01:01:37.059
and so are you!

01:01:37.061 --> 01:01:41.396
I am not a leader of men,
Willy, and neither are you.

01:01:42.498 --> 01:01:46.368
You were never anything but
a hard-working drummer

01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:49.438
who landed in the ash can,
like all the rest of them.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.939
And me?

01:01:51.607 --> 01:01:53.875
I'm a dollar an hour, Willy!

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:57.279
I tried seven states.
I couldn't raise it!

01:01:58.414 --> 01:01:59.915
One buck an hour!

01:02:01.484 --> 01:02:03.885
Do you gather my meaning, huh?

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:09.458
I'm not bringing home prizes...

01:02:12.295 --> 01:02:15.097
Anymore.

01:02:15.099 --> 01:02:18.633
And you're going to stop waiting
for me to bring them home, Pop.

01:02:21.304 --> 01:02:23.071
I'm nothing.

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.575
I'm just what I am,

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:28.577
that's all.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:01.409
Billy!

01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:03.311
Billy, you were amazing.

01:03:03.313 --> 01:03:04.613
You...

01:03:04.615 --> 01:03:05.947
Billy...

01:03:05.949 --> 01:03:08.350
What? Hey, hey.

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:10.452
Billy.

01:03:11.821 --> 01:03:13.655
Excuse me?

01:03:13.657 --> 01:03:15.590
Sorry, we're just, um...

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:17.993
We're just...

01:03:23.866 --> 01:03:25.400
Billy!

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:28.503
Hey!

01:03:29.372 --> 01:03:30.739
What was that?

01:03:32.341 --> 01:03:33.675
I'm nervous.

01:03:35.345 --> 01:03:38.713
I told you I would tell
you when I was nervous.

01:03:39.515 --> 01:03:41.416
I'm nervous.

01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:44.085
You know what I was
thinking up there today?

01:03:44.087 --> 01:03:46.822
I wasn't thinking about, you
know, how well I was doing,

01:03:46.824 --> 01:03:48.023
or how much I wanted to win.

01:03:48.025 --> 01:03:49.391
I was thinking about
how even though

01:03:49.393 --> 01:03:51.560
you were trying to
hide it last night,

01:03:51.562 --> 01:03:53.094
I could see that you were sad.

01:03:53.096 --> 01:03:55.363
And I knew how to
make you happy.

01:03:55.365 --> 01:03:56.798
And then you asked me to leave.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.066
I don't know why you
asked me to leave.

01:03:58.068 --> 01:03:59.868
You were sad again and
I knew how to fix it.

01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:00.969
No, Billy, you can't...

01:04:00.971 --> 01:04:04.072
- Yes, I can!
- Fix it!

01:04:04.074 --> 01:04:06.608
Up until a week ago, I
was pretty straight.

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:08.543
The medication, right.

01:04:08.545 --> 01:04:09.911
I'm saying, look...

01:04:09.913 --> 01:04:12.013
I'm saying I'm sad, too, Rachel.

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:14.115
But the pills I take
to make me not sad,

01:04:14.117 --> 01:04:15.750
they make me feel nothing.

01:04:15.752 --> 01:04:17.285
All right. Those are my options.

01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:18.753
Sad or numb.

01:04:18.755 --> 01:04:20.989
So I stopped taking them,
and I didn't tell anyone.

01:04:20.991 --> 01:04:22.591
And I was scared.

01:04:22.593 --> 01:04:25.093
- And I thought I was gonna go...
- Crazy or something.

01:04:25.095 --> 01:04:26.695
But I don't. I feel great.

01:04:26.697 --> 01:04:29.364
Rachel, I feel, like, alive.
Like I could just...

01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:31.399
Do I need to call someone?

01:04:32.435 --> 01:04:33.468
What?

01:04:34.637 --> 01:04:36.738
Do I need to call someone?

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:41.309
That's why you don't wanna
be with me, isn't it?

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:43.645
It's 'cause you...
You don't realize.

01:04:43.647 --> 01:04:44.980
You're messed up too, Rachel.

01:04:44.982 --> 01:04:46.214
- Hey.
- I know you think

01:04:46.216 --> 01:04:48.350
'cause you have a job
and an apartment,

01:04:48.352 --> 01:04:51.419
that you're fine, but
you're not fine. And...

01:04:51.421 --> 01:04:53.955
Go ahead. Call someone.

01:04:53.957 --> 01:04:55.457
Go ahead.

01:04:55.459 --> 01:04:57.092
You know, under
normal circumstances,

01:04:57.094 --> 01:04:58.260
I would walk away right now.

01:04:58.262 --> 01:05:01.296
- "Normal circumstances"?
- Yes.

01:05:01.298 --> 01:05:03.231
But I am... I am your teacher.

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:05.066
So I have to stay here.

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:07.535
I have to call someone

01:05:07.537 --> 01:05:10.171
and I have to tell
them what is going on.

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:13.141
What's going on?

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:19.447
All I know is that I...

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:22.784
I can't walk away
from you right now.

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:31.259
Then I will.

01:05:56.086 --> 01:05:58.286
<i>Hello, you've reached
Albert Alvarez,</i>

01:05:58.288 --> 01:05:59.621
<i>principal of Franklin
High School.</i>

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:01.222
<i>Please leave your
name and number,</i>

01:06:01.224 --> 01:06:03.925
and I'll get back to you ASAP.

01:06:05.162 --> 01:06:07.796
Hi. It's, uh... It's Rachel.

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:10.632
It's Miss Stevens.

01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:13.234
<i>Um...</i>

01:06:14.837 --> 01:06:18.373
<i>I... The...</i>

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:22.944
<i>The thing that you wanted me
to call you about with Billy.</i>

01:06:22.946 --> 01:06:24.946
<i>With, uh...</i>

01:06:24.948 --> 01:06:28.350
<i>With William Mitman. I'm, um...</i>

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:31.920
Billy?

01:06:31.922 --> 01:06:33.722
<i>I'm feeling a little...</i>

01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:36.391
<i>worried about him.</i>

01:06:36.393 --> 01:06:37.559
Sam?

01:06:37.561 --> 01:06:39.260
So I'm calling.

01:06:42.465 --> 01:06:44.032
Call me back.

01:06:44.034 --> 01:06:46.434
So call me back, please.

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:51.339
Shit.

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:22.137
Hey.

01:07:22.139 --> 01:07:24.739
Hey, come on.

01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:27.609
You need air? I got air.

01:07:41.824 --> 01:07:43.525
They just...

01:07:47.196 --> 01:07:49.264
take over, you know.

01:07:51.167 --> 01:07:53.668
Yeah, I've been trying
to quit my whole life.

01:07:56.873 --> 01:08:01.443
I actually find cigarettes
to be more difficult.

01:08:02.111 --> 01:08:06.047
Being a teacher is difficult.

01:08:06.049 --> 01:08:07.949
Everybody says that.

01:08:09.151 --> 01:08:10.752
But really, it's not.

01:08:13.989 --> 01:08:15.690
Excuse me?

01:08:17.393 --> 01:08:19.993
You know how a teacher like
me has been around so long?

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:22.897
No, Walter, I don't.

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:25.265
Well...

01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:27.001
It's because I don't
get involved.

01:08:27.002 --> 01:08:28.536
Yeah?

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:31.372
Well, that will only work
at your shitty school.

01:08:32.073 --> 01:08:34.341
No, let me finish.

01:08:34.344 --> 01:08:36.678
I care a lot about my job.

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:41.916
And I'm pretty good at it.

01:08:44.353 --> 01:08:46.321
I care that my students succeed.

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:49.290
They graduate.

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:51.993
The outside.

01:08:54.263 --> 01:08:56.064
Tell you what I don't care about

01:08:56.732 --> 01:08:57.999
is the inside.

01:08:58.001 --> 01:09:01.935
Their... silly little lies.

01:09:01.938 --> 01:09:05.506
That's the stuff that makes
people think that it's hard.

01:09:07.943 --> 01:09:09.911
'Cause that stuff is hard.

01:09:11.947 --> 01:09:14.482
You gotta stay outside.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:19.720
How do you stay outside
when something...

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:23.558
I mean, these kids

01:09:25.027 --> 01:09:27.562
are right there in front of you.

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:30.665
I have my own.

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:33.033
You have kids?

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.071
Yeah.

01:10:04.934 --> 01:10:05.900
We should go back inside.

01:10:05.902 --> 01:10:08.069
They're gonna announce
the award soon.

01:10:09.371 --> 01:10:11.940
You go ahead. I'm
gonna finish this.

01:10:12.641 --> 01:10:13.908
All right.

01:10:21.084 --> 01:10:23.251
Wow! What a weekend.

01:10:23.253 --> 01:10:26.554
Who's a little nervous?
That's okay.

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:31.059
I just wanna thank you
for letting us witness

01:10:31.061 --> 01:10:32.927
all of your talents.

01:10:32.929 --> 01:10:37.165
Truly, there was such
incredible work this weekend.

01:10:37.167 --> 01:10:40.034
And we just wanna
encourage all of you

01:10:40.036 --> 01:10:41.669
to keep striving,

01:10:41.671 --> 01:10:44.472
keep trying to
pursue your dreams.

01:10:44.474 --> 01:10:46.908
And a big congratulations
to the finalists.

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:49.844
We had a really tough
job, I think, this year.

01:10:49.846 --> 01:10:52.981
But I... I think we're
ready to announce

01:10:52.983 --> 01:10:54.782
the winners!

01:10:54.784 --> 01:10:57.752
In third place, Jordan Hargrove

01:10:57.754 --> 01:11:00.421
from Clarksdale Club.

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:19.941
And in second place,

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:22.677
William Mitman, from
Franklin High School.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.688
Go, Billy!

01:11:38.727 --> 01:11:41.596
And the winner is Arthur Jones,

01:11:41.598 --> 01:11:44.032
from Westbro High School.

01:11:52.474 --> 01:11:55.109
Let's give all our
winners a big hand.

01:12:44.493 --> 01:12:46.527
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:47.729
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

01:12:47.731 --> 01:12:49.364
Is everything all right?

01:12:49.366 --> 01:12:52.033
No. Well, I mean, yes.

01:13:00.275 --> 01:13:01.876
Well, um...

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:04.846
I've been trying to work up
the guts to ask you out.

01:13:04.848 --> 01:13:08.583
And my friends convinced
me that if I didn't...

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:14.021
I'd regret it.

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:19.894
My last name is Rose.

01:13:20.763 --> 01:13:21.829
Add me?

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:23.931
Sure.

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:27.935
Hey, your monologue was amazing.

01:13:28.437 --> 01:13:30.138
Thank you.

01:13:31.039 --> 01:13:32.573
Bye.

01:13:57.065 --> 01:13:58.933
♪

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:17.919
- Really? Just pull over...
- Are you kidding me?

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:52.286
Don't make me put this out.

01:14:56.558 --> 01:14:58.693
I had a cigarette this weekend.

01:15:09.973 --> 01:15:12.306
Neither one of us should smoke.

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:30.758
I didn't wanna come on
the trip this weekend.

01:15:33.095 --> 01:15:35.263
I was fine to come, and then...

01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:40.868
On Thursday night, I
went to see a play

01:15:43.038 --> 01:15:45.239
at the theater where
my mom used to...

01:15:48.343 --> 01:15:49.677
This, uh...

01:15:49.679 --> 01:15:51.946
This old friend of
hers called me and...

01:15:56.952 --> 01:15:59.387
I had no idea how
hard it would be.

01:16:02.157 --> 01:16:04.926
It was that thing

01:16:04.928 --> 01:16:08.195
where people say you
lose them again.

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:18.239
Because she wasn't there.

01:16:40.128 --> 01:16:43.965
Um, did Billy ever
take the <i>Gatsby</i> test?

01:16:53.442 --> 01:16:55.543
Shit.

01:16:55.545 --> 01:16:57.812
Here she goes again.

01:16:58.947 --> 01:17:00.481
I brought the wrong folder.

01:17:00.483 --> 01:17:01.649
I don't have the test.

01:17:01.651 --> 01:17:03.217
So? I'll just take
it back at school.

01:17:03.219 --> 01:17:04.986
No. I lied.

01:17:04.988 --> 01:17:06.287
- You what?
- Yeah, what?

01:17:06.289 --> 01:17:07.788
They weren't gonna let
you come on the trip

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:09.490
if you had incomplete
work, and so I lied.

01:17:09.492 --> 01:17:11.359
Because I knew that coming
on the trip mattered to you.

01:17:11.361 --> 01:17:16.263
I really needed you to take
it this weekend, and now...

01:17:16.265 --> 01:17:17.198
And now you can't.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:19.667
And if when you do
take it, you fail...

01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:21.135
- Miss Stevens?
- Margot, I know.

01:17:21.137 --> 01:17:22.670
I actually think

01:17:22.672 --> 01:17:25.473
sometimes it's okay to lie.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:27.975
What?

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:31.145
Sometimes I even think it's
the right thing to do.

01:17:32.748 --> 01:17:33.981
And as it turns out,

01:17:33.983 --> 01:17:36.183
I actually have a copy
of the test in my bag.

01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:38.352
It has all the correct
answers on it,

01:17:38.354 --> 01:17:40.588
but I could read the
questions out loud.

01:17:40.590 --> 01:17:42.156
No, it's a different test.

01:17:42.158 --> 01:17:43.124
What?

01:17:43.126 --> 01:17:45.860
It's always new questions
on a make up test.

01:17:45.862 --> 01:17:48.162
Well, perhaps I'm being
optimistic or naive,

01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:50.765
but I really don't think
Billy engineered all this

01:17:50.767 --> 01:17:53.067
just so he could cheat
and ace the test.

01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:57.538
You know what, Margot?

01:17:58.407 --> 01:17:59.573
What?

01:18:00.709 --> 01:18:02.910
You're right.

01:18:02.912 --> 01:18:06.247
Thank you. Okay. Come get it.

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:09.984
I didn't bring my laptop.

01:18:09.986 --> 01:18:11.952
You can use my notebook.

01:18:13.855 --> 01:18:16.090
Hey.

01:18:16.092 --> 01:18:18.025
Did you really read the book?

01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:43.217
Okay.

01:18:43.219 --> 01:18:45.786
"In F. Scott Fitzgerald's

for the characters?"

01:19:16.852 --> 01:19:18.686
Kinda looks like
she's writing a lot.

01:19:18.688 --> 01:19:22.423
Maybe she's just drawing
a bunch of smiley faces.

01:19:29.564 --> 01:19:31.465
I think she's done.
