Welcome to

01:56.200 --> 01:59.034
we're throwing a house party
tonight, y'all.

01:59.078 --> 02:01.411
So make sure
you strap yourselves in,

02:01.455 --> 02:04.289
because things

02:04.333 --> 02:09.128
Because tonight we welcome back
our singers from group a.

02:10.047 --> 02:12.923
Now, we have a new
wild card backstage

02:12.967 --> 02:14.258
ready to crash this bash.

02:14.260 --> 02:16.218
I hear tonight's newcomer

02:16.262 --> 02:18.345
is pulling an all-nighter.

02:18.389 --> 02:20.973
- So y'all ready for this?
- Whoa!

02:21.016 --> 02:22.850

02:22.893 --> 02:24.810
Nick:
All right, but first

02:24.854 --> 02:27.104
let's give it up

02:27.148 --> 02:29.982
for our favorite
social butterflies.

02:30.025 --> 02:32.317
They never met a party
they didn't like.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.986
It's our panel of detectives.

02:33.988 --> 02:36.071
Whip it.

02:36.115 --> 02:37.531
Nicole: Whoo!

02:37.575 --> 02:39.449
Cheers, everybody!

02:40.369 --> 02:43.996
- Nicole: Wow!
- Robin: Yeah!

02:43.998 --> 02:46.290
Y'all look like y'all
are ready to party.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.042
- We are.
- We are ready to party!

02:49.086 --> 02:52.254
- Oh, my gosh.
- Nicole got the neon ray
thing kicking off.

02:52.298 --> 02:53.380
I'm here to glow up.

02:53.716 --> 02:56.383
And I am feeling
the deep plunge, honey,
with the v.

02:56.427 --> 02:58.302
- Yes.
- My inner robin thicke.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.721
- Yes, sir.
- I'm just saying, ken,

03:00.764 --> 03:03.056
everybody else pulled
all the stops out for
house party night,

03:03.100 --> 03:05.851
but are you the valet?
I mean, I don't understand.

03:05.895 --> 03:07.227
Jenny: Oh!

03:08.105 --> 03:09.938
No one told me.

03:09.982 --> 03:12.107
It was on the group text, ken.

03:12.151 --> 03:14.985
What? You have a group text?

03:15.029 --> 03:15.986
Yeah, everybody's
on the group text.

03:16.030 --> 03:18.322
It's me, nick, robin, jenny.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.199
Yeah, and joel mchale,
craig robinson.

03:20.242 --> 03:21.950
- Joel mchale?
- Cheryl hines.

03:21.994 --> 03:23.660
Craig robinson?

03:23.704 --> 03:26.496
And this is the day
I chose to wear monochromatic?

03:26.540 --> 03:28.207
For this?

03:28.250 --> 03:30.125
You know, we could use
a stripper for our party,

03:30.169 --> 03:32.586
so why don't you get
some dancing on?

03:32.630 --> 03:34.296
Okay.

03:34.340 --> 03:36.882
Come on, ken, dance! Dance!

03:36.926 --> 03:38.884
Ken, ken, ken, ken!

03:38.928 --> 03:41.094
Take it off.
Take it off.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.596
Dance, dance, dance, dance!

03:42.598 --> 03:44.806
I have integrity.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.850
I'm not desperate.
I'm not desperate.

03:46.852 --> 03:50.354

I have integrity.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.816
Nicole: Yass!

03:54.860 --> 03:56.985
- That's how you do it.
- Ken: That is how you do it.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.070
You don't go shirtless.

03:58.072 --> 03:58.904
You wear a shirt--

03:59.156 --> 04:00.489
because you're ashamed
of your body,

04:00.532 --> 04:02.032
and then you go...

04:02.076 --> 04:04.034
Thank you!

04:04.078 --> 04:05.994
- Nick: There it is.
- Nicole: Come on!

04:06.038 --> 04:09.414
We also still have
our big take it off buzzer.

04:09.458 --> 04:12.000
This is new.
This is new, people.

04:12.044 --> 04:15.212
Now again, panel,
only one of you can use it

04:15.256 --> 04:19.132
when you're absolutely sure
who is behind the mask.

04:19.176 --> 04:22.386
Now let's get
this party started!

04:22.429 --> 04:27.099
One singer we're all happy
rsvped tonight is the bull.

04:27.142 --> 04:29.393
So what's he bringing
to the party tonight?

04:29.436 --> 04:30.477
Let's find out.

04:33.274 --> 04:36.358
I am no stranger
to a house party.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.111
My parties are notorious
for having great music,

04:39.154 --> 04:41.989
- everybody dancing.
- Okay, party animal.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.240
I wonder if
I've ever been there.

04:43.242 --> 04:45.534
It is litty city committee.

04:45.577 --> 04:48.370
- Carnegie hall.
- Yeah.

04:48.372 --> 04:51.331
As a kid,
I was actually a wallflower.

04:53.168 --> 04:56.461
But now I'm the life
of the party.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.883
There couldn't be a more
important time

05:01.927 --> 05:04.344
for me to perform this
specific song,

05:05.055 --> 05:07.139
and show my solidarity

05:07.141 --> 05:08.432
and my support,

05:09.977 --> 05:13.770
to the one and only,
britney spears.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.857
There are so many challenges
in doing the dancing.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.192
My feet never felt
more gigantic,

05:19.236 --> 05:22.029
but I know that I definitely
have what it takes.

You want a jump and a split?"

Tonight each of our singers
are bringing something
to this soiree

08:02.232 --> 08:05.400
that provides a clue to
their secret famous identities.

08:05.444 --> 08:08.153

08:26.048 --> 08:29.132
- I'm just kidding.
- I love it.

08:29.134 --> 08:32.969
Usually I'm the type
of bull that focuses
on what's on the inside,

08:33.013 --> 08:36.431
but today, it's the wrapping
that I'm showing off.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.184
- Oh.
- Oh, the wrapping.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.227
It's gotta be someone
that can rap,

08:40.479 --> 08:43.230
like a trey songz,
who also knows how to party.

08:43.273 --> 08:44.397
Ken: That's a good--

08:44.691 --> 08:48.235
or someone who's amazing
and also raps-- donald glover.

08:48.237 --> 08:51.321
- Childish gambino?
- He's amazing!

08:51.365 --> 08:53.865
- He can do anything.
- Absolutely.

08:53.909 --> 08:56.201
You know, I don't know if
the rapping thing is helping me

08:56.245 --> 08:57.827
because he hasn't rapped yet.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.247
Did you guys see carnegie hall
in the clue package?

09:00.249 --> 09:01.831
- Yes.
- I'm starting to think

09:01.833 --> 09:03.124
that maybe this is
a broadway star.

09:03.168 --> 09:06.545
- Yeah.
- And maybe someone
from "hamilton."

09:06.588 --> 09:07.879
right?

09:07.923 --> 09:10.298
- Like anthony ramos.
- Yeah.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.217
Ken: Anthony ramos,
that's a good one.

09:12.261 --> 09:15.595
Another brilliant talent
from "hamilton"

09:15.597 --> 09:16.930
is leslie odom jr.

09:16.974 --> 09:19.057
- Ken: Oh, absolutely.
- Jenny: Yes.

09:19.101 --> 09:22.310

oscar nominees
on this show,

09:22.354 --> 09:25.021
and he has just been nominated
for an oscar...

09:25.065 --> 09:26.815
-- That's right.
- ...For playing sam cooke.

09:26.858 --> 09:30.277
- And was amazing.
- I got some clues
to connect it.

09:30.279 --> 09:32.654
- Connect it!
- Okay, let's connect.

09:32.656 --> 09:34.864
That's what we're all
here for tonight, right?

09:34.866 --> 09:36.116
- 'cause it's a party!
- That's right.

09:36.118 --> 09:38.243
- It's a house party.
- Connect four.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.287
- Skee-ska!
- It's a connect four party!

09:40.330 --> 09:42.581
Okay, I'm connecting the clues.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.249
We saw the scrubs,
we saw the stethoscope.

09:44.251 --> 09:47.294
Leslie actually
played a doctor in the movie

09:47.337 --> 09:49.379
"murder on orient express."

09:49.381 --> 09:52.424

- Nick: That's sherlock
scherzi over there.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.510

her nick focals.

09:55.554 --> 09:57.095
I'm nick focals, okay?

09:57.097 --> 09:59.139
All right, well, those were
some excellent guesses,

09:59.182 --> 10:01.141
and this was
an excellent performance.

10:01.184 --> 10:03.226
Y'all make some noise
one more time for the bull.

10:04.229 --> 10:08.023
Head on backstage.
Charge your way back there.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.443

<i> and the singers</i>
<i> will reveal juicy details</i>

10:31.131 --> 10:32.172

10:32.215 --> 10:34.007
<i> Swiftly head to tmz.Com</i>

10:34.051 --> 10:36.051
<i> for a sneak peek</i>
<i> at an a-list superstar</i>

10:36.094 --> 10:37.385
<i> connected to the group.</i>

10:44.770 --> 10:48.313
Welcome back
to house party night here
at "the masked singer."

10:48.357 --> 10:51.858
our next singer
is a furry creature

10:51.902 --> 10:54.986
who made headlines last week
as a wild card.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.321
Hamster.

10:59.368 --> 11:00.742
As you've probably guessed
by now...

11:00.786 --> 11:01.701
Go, hamster. Go, hamster.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.536
Hamster: ...I'm a bit
of a party animal.

11:03.580 --> 11:06.539
Shake that ham!
Oh, my goodness.

11:07.584 --> 11:10.126
And you should've seen me
in my 20s.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.962
I was living a huge city

11:13.006 --> 11:14.381
working with my best pals.

11:14.716 --> 11:17.759
- Oh, that's his whole crew.
- Maybe it's someone
from "friends."

11:17.803 --> 11:21.179
the fun that we had
when we were younger
was the most fun ever.

11:21.223 --> 11:23.682
- It's a basset hound.
- So cute.

11:23.684 --> 11:27.510
There's nothing like
not being famous,
and the next day being famous.

11:27.521 --> 11:28.812
( laughing )

11:28.855 --> 11:30.897
and that's what happened
to all of us,

11:30.899 --> 11:33.900
and the fact that
we're still friends all these
years later is phenomenal.

11:33.902 --> 11:37.487
They're really gonna
get a kick out of me
being here, you know?

11:37.531 --> 11:40.198
And I'll prove myself,

11:40.200 --> 11:41.950
and I'll make nick
even more uncomfortable.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.618
...Be fondling on

11:43.662 --> 11:44.953
what?
Did you just pee on me?

11:44.996 --> 11:46.329
( laughing )

11:48.125 --> 11:49.124
I love this character.

13:40.862 --> 13:44.447
I'm over here, hamster.
I'm staying-- keeping
my distance from you.

13:46.243 --> 13:47.617
I can't help it.
I love the hamster.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.202
You have to love the hamster.

13:49.246 --> 13:51.955
You're a crazy little thing

13:51.998 --> 13:54.332
Who likes to party!

13:54.376 --> 13:56.876
I can't get over
your cute little feet.

13:56.920 --> 13:58.545
Look at those little things.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.463
Aw, thank you. Thank you.

14:01.633 --> 14:03.132
Why are you petting me,
hamster?

14:03.134 --> 14:05.093
Oh, sorry. Sorry.

14:05.136 --> 14:09.097
All right, now before
we hear the panel's guesses
for who hamster is,

14:09.099 --> 14:12.016
they need to see what
the hamster brings to the party.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.309
Men in black, bring it out.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.020

14:32.205 --> 14:36.958

14:36.960 --> 14:39.294
Oh, my god.

14:39.337 --> 14:42.297
Ken: Look at the--
I mean, look at the hamster.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.215
- Jenny: Oh!
- Nicole: He's thirsty.

14:44.259 --> 14:49.679
- Hamster!
- Oh, my god.

14:49.723 --> 14:53.016
- Ken:
He's just looking for stuff.
- Nick: Oh, my goodness.

14:53.059 --> 14:56.227
Okay, quit trying to rob
the man in black.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.314
Ken:
This is obviously someone

14:59.357 --> 15:02.108
who, to me,
is a great comedic actor.

15:02.110 --> 15:04.986
I mean, like,
he said he got famous

15:05.030 --> 15:06.988
with all his friends
in that package,

15:07.032 --> 15:09.324
and to me,
that's screaming "snl."

15:09.367 --> 15:11.242
- yes.
- This could be will ferrell.

15:11.286 --> 15:13.036
He could be,
like, david spade.

15:13.038 --> 15:15.038
This could be jim breuer.
This could be--

15:15.081 --> 15:18.333
- oh! You liking breuer? Mm!
- Jenny: I like that.

15:18.376 --> 15:20.919
You know,
in that same "snl" world
like you were saying,

15:20.962 --> 15:22.670
I was thinking,
like, rob schneider.

15:22.714 --> 15:25.548
I'd like rob schneider.
I think he's a good guess.

15:25.592 --> 15:26.507
Hmm. Interesting.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.384
In the voice, too,
the vocal tone,

15:28.386 --> 15:29.969
I heard more rob schneider than
I did some of the other guys.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.387
Jenny: Yeah,
and rob can sing, so...

15:31.431 --> 15:33.056
Well, when I looked
at the clues,

15:33.099 --> 15:34.307
I saw a lot of dancing
and performing,

15:34.351 --> 15:35.850
like "west side story."
I love my musicals.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.727
So it made me think,
like, latin flair.

15:37.729 --> 15:41.397
- Yeah.
- You know, I love is
john leguizamo.

15:41.399 --> 15:43.483
- Ken: Mmm, yes.
- He is a genius.

15:43.526 --> 15:45.109
Oh, I love that guess!

15:45.111 --> 15:48.363
- However,
I saw a basset hound.
- Yes.

15:48.365 --> 15:50.406
And it made me think
of angela bassett.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.991
And I'm like, who's worked
with angela bassett?

15:52.035 --> 15:55.620
Paul rudd
in "avengers: Endgame."

15:55.664 --> 15:58.039
there's, like,
so many talented
people in that cast.

15:58.083 --> 16:01.417
There's chris evans,
there's mark ruffalo.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.295
- ( clears throat )
- excuse me?

16:04.339 --> 16:06.881
- I was in "avengers: Endgame."
- no, you weren't.

16:06.925 --> 16:07.966
- I was.
- I saw it.

16:08.009 --> 16:09.676
I was a security guard
with no lines.

16:09.719 --> 16:12.887
I remember what happened.
I sprinted to the bathroom.

16:12.931 --> 16:14.472
You went to the bathroom
during my scene?

16:14.516 --> 16:16.015
I remember what happened.
I sneezed.

16:16.059 --> 16:18.059
You sneezed during my scene?

16:18.103 --> 16:19.978
Nick:
Well, one thing's for sure,

16:20.021 --> 16:22.397
hamster's performance
was nothing to sneeze at.

16:22.440 --> 16:25.441
- Whoo!
- Go ahead and crawl backstage.

16:27.988 --> 16:30.196
Wrong way! Go over there!

16:30.240 --> 16:34.200
- I love him.
- Such a fun show!
It's a party!

16:35.078 --> 16:36.119
Hamster:
It was a party!

16:36.162 --> 16:39.163
This is more fun
than I've had in years.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.332

16:54.389 --> 16:56.222

17:13.700 --> 17:15.283

people in the world.

17:15.326 --> 17:16.534
- Puffer fish.
- Maybe it's someone

17:16.578 --> 17:17.952
who worked
with toni braxton.

17:17.996 --> 17:20.955
I actually used to be
the hostess with the mostess.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.915
- Cookies.
- Family size.

17:22.959 --> 17:28.254
But these days,
I limit the people that I allow
into my personal space.

17:28.298 --> 17:31.123
And as you get older,
you realize it's okay

17:31.134 --> 17:33.426

from your life.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.889

All right, now, panel,
you know what time it is.

32:43.545 --> 32:45.671
It's time for
your first impression guesses.

32:45.714 --> 32:47.839

the golden ear trophy
this year?

32:52.846 --> 32:54.680
This girl.

32:54.723 --> 32:58.016
All right, now write down
who you think the pepper is.

32:58.060 --> 33:00.602
And you better make it quick,
because the last person

33:00.646 --> 33:05.273
to put their card in the slot
has to eat a mega hot pepper.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.859

Oh, no! No!

35:00.933 --> 35:03.225

- Yeah.

35:03.268 --> 35:07.020
That's right,
we got milk and roller skates
up in our house parties.

35:07.022 --> 35:10.107
Yeah, so you bring
roller skates to a party

35:10.109 --> 35:12.442
because you don't need
a driver's license.

35:12.486 --> 35:15.445
Oh!

35:15.489 --> 35:16.530
- You got something, ken?
- Go ahead, buddy.

35:16.824 --> 35:19.366
Yeah, it's a connection
to olivia rodrigo, right?

35:19.409 --> 35:21.118
- Ken: Yep.
- Tell me why, robin.

35:21.161 --> 35:22.244
Well,
the "driver's license" song.

35:22.571 --> 35:25.205
And I was gonna say
when she first started singing,

35:25.249 --> 35:28.708
there was this passion
and this sultriness

35:28.752 --> 35:31.044
that reminded me a little bit
of olivia rodrigo.

35:31.088 --> 35:33.130
But I'm not sure that
that's the same exact voice.

35:33.173 --> 35:38.093
- What do you think, ken?
- Well, when I think about
the tiktok of it all,

35:38.095 --> 35:40.220
I'm not as
well-versed in tiktok.

35:40.264 --> 35:41.680
- As me?
- I'm more of a-- yeah.

35:41.723 --> 35:45.392
I'm more of a myspace/
linkedin kind of gal.

35:45.394 --> 35:48.520
But there's that song,
"tik tok."

35:48.564 --> 35:49.604
that's kesha, right?

35:49.648 --> 35:51.273
I mean, it kind of has

35:51.316 --> 35:53.984
kind of a kesha-like quality.

35:54.027 --> 35:56.111
Kesha's not
a bad guess at all.

35:56.146 --> 35:57.154
Look, I'm gonna put
some clues together.

35:57.489 --> 36:02.075
Chiliwood. I'm thinking
of a childhood star, right?

36:02.119 --> 36:04.244
Haley steinfeld.

36:04.246 --> 36:06.705
She was a childhood star.
She was in "true grit."

36:06.748 --> 36:09.833
- and can sing.
- She can sing and
she's oscar nominated.

36:09.877 --> 36:12.377
And she was in
the pitch perfect films.

36:12.379 --> 36:13.920
Ken: Yeah.
"pitch perfect."

36:13.964 --> 36:15.046
all right, that's a good guess.

36:15.090 --> 36:17.841
But the talent
is so great this season.

36:17.843 --> 36:20.302
The pepper could be, like,
the hugest star,

36:20.345 --> 36:22.596
like lady gaga
or pink or miley.

36:22.639 --> 36:25.891
Yeah. With that voice? Yes.

36:25.934 --> 36:27.726
- I'm on fire here.
- Ken: Ah! Ha!

36:27.769 --> 36:31.021
- That was a robin thicke pun.
- I know, I know.

36:31.064 --> 36:33.607
Robin: I have no idea
who this is,

36:33.650 --> 36:35.025
but beyond a seasonable doubt,

36:35.068 --> 36:38.153
that was-- that was amazing.

36:38.197 --> 36:41.823
Nicole: The best wild card
we've ever had.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.408
Just when we think
we know the show

36:43.452 --> 36:45.368
and who is going to advance
or who has a chance

36:45.412 --> 36:47.829
of advancing
to the finals, we don't.

36:47.831 --> 36:49.289

Robin, you said chuck norris.

38:52.164 --> 38:53.788
Robin: Remember,
the first clue we got

38:53.832 --> 38:56.416
was that he replaced
arnold schwarzenegger

38:56.460 --> 38:59.294
- in an action movie.
- I love it, robin.

38:59.338 --> 39:01.421
I'm gonna stick
with chuck norris.

39:01.465 --> 39:02.922
It'd be amazing
if this was chuck norris.

39:02.966 --> 39:07.302

Michael caine.

39:14.061 --> 39:16.353

chuck norris was bad.

39:18.648 --> 39:20.982
Nicole:
But he's been so fun,

39:20.984 --> 39:22.817
and I thought
his voice was great,

39:22.819 --> 39:25.070
and I know this person's done
a lot of musicals, can sing,

39:25.113 --> 39:26.321
and they're from the uk.

39:26.365 --> 39:28.823
This could be james corden.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.201
Okay. That's a good one.

39:31.244 --> 39:34.454
- All right, now, ken?
- Yes, sir.

39:34.456 --> 39:36.331
Hugh jackman.

39:38.835 --> 39:40.960
Honestly, after tonight,

39:40.962 --> 39:44.798
everything else just goes
to gordon ramsay.

39:44.841 --> 39:46.800
I'm looking at that face.

39:46.843 --> 39:49.260
That's like "master chef jr.",
you know what I mean?

39:49.304 --> 39:51.971
- Robin: Not wolverine?
- Not a wolverine.

to gordon ramsay.

- No, I'm ready.
- Oh!

I am so right on this guess.

40:04.986 --> 40:06.319
- Watch this, ken.
- Oh, gosh.

40:06.363 --> 40:09.155
It has to be an action star

40:09.199 --> 40:12.117
because he said he replaced
arnold schwarzenegger.

40:12.160 --> 40:17.247
And the obvious--
he played the baby in
"look who's talking."

40:17.249 --> 40:20.458
this is bruce willis.

40:22.337 --> 40:24.963
