 ADULT ADAM: <i> Back in the '80s,</i>

00:01.135 --> 00:05.070
  <i> Philadelphia hosted</i>
  <i> one of the most legendary</i>
  <i> charity rock concerts</i>

00:05.072 --> 00:06.638
  <i> ever assembled: Live Aid,</i>

00:06.640 --> 00:10.042
   <i> and no one wanted to go</i>
   <i> more than Big Tasty.</i>

00:10.044 --> 00:12.778
 Dad, we need to have
 an insanely important talk.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.380
     And if you say,
     "Go to your mother,"

00:14.382 --> 00:15.681
    there will be
    serious consequences.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.249
          Not listening.
          Go to your mother.

00:17.251 --> 00:19.318
  Okay, you know how
  all the awesome stuff happens

00:19.320 --> 00:21.754
  in New York and L.A.
  and Florida, but never here?

00:21.756 --> 00:23.222
            You do know
            that Philadelphia

00:23.224 --> 00:25.090
         is the birthplace
         of our country, right?

00:25.092 --> 00:27.626
  Enough with
  your folk tales, old man!

00:27.628 --> 00:29.028
 I'm talking about now.

00:29.030 --> 00:29.595
 It's called Live Aid.

00:29.597 --> 00:31.463
 The world's biggest
 rock concert ever

00:31.465 --> 00:34.433
 is happening here
 this weekend,
 and I need your car.

00:34.435 --> 00:35.768
    What's wrong with your van?

00:35.770 --> 00:36.368
   Doesn't start.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.470
 I think it needs
 new spark plugs
 or gas or something.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.773
 Point is, give me your keys
 and wallet. Hurry.

00:40.775 --> 00:42.307
        Here's the thing... No.

00:42.309 --> 00:44.043
  But I presented
  such a strong case!

00:44.045 --> 00:45.577
           This concert's been
           all over the news.

00:45.579 --> 00:48.614
  There's gonna be a million
  morons pouring into the city,

00:48.616 --> 00:50.816
         each one with bad hair
         and worse ideas.

00:50.818 --> 00:53.318
 But I have the worst ideas!
 I should be there, too.

00:53.320 --> 00:57.456
  No way I'm allowing my car
  to be driven in that madness.

00:57.458 --> 00:58.123
            It'll never return.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.458
 Do you even know
 who's performing at Live Aid?

00:59.460 --> 01:02.528
          I don't know,
          and more importantly,
          I don't care.

 Really?
              No!

01:40.734 --> 01:44.136
       None of these names
       mean anything to me!

  ADULT ADAM: <i> It was October 5,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

01:58.686 --> 02:00.252
   <i> and I had a genius plan</i>

02:00.254 --> 02:02.287
      <i> to be the coolest</i>
      <i> freshman ever.</i>

02:02.289 --> 02:04.189
      Big news.
      I'm starting a club:

       The Saturday Night
       Live Society.

02:06.494 --> 02:07.493
    Ugh. Here we go.

02:07.495 --> 02:08.160
           It'll be awesome.

02:08.162 --> 02:10.128
         We can wear costumes
         and perform skits

02:10.131 --> 02:12.164
         and do all their
         greatest characters,

02:12.166 --> 02:13.265
        like the Church Lady.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.434
      (IMITATING CHURCH LADY)
      Isn't that special?

02:15.436 --> 02:17.603
 Cut the crap, dude.
       You sound crazy.

02:17.605 --> 02:18.303
 We're freshmen now.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.505
 We got to start thinking
 about our reps.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.507
      (IMITATING FERNANDO)
      You look mah-velous.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.342
     Please!
     We're in public.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.543
 Girls hate that stuff.

02:24.545 --> 02:25.144
      We really do.

02:25.146 --> 02:27.479
      Impressing girls is
      the least of my concerns.

02:27.481 --> 02:30.415
       I'm just trying to
       make it through the day.

02:30.417 --> 02:32.518
       Oh, balls.

02:33.154 --> 02:35.454
     It's her. She's here.

02:35.589 --> 02:38.524
     It's...Waffle Girl.

02:38.526 --> 02:39.358
      Waffle Girl?

02:39.360 --> 02:41.393
     ADULT ADAM:
    <i> Oh, yes, Waffle Girl.</i>

02:41.395 --> 02:43.195
<i> She was my first crush ever.</i>

02:43.197 --> 02:44.530
      <i> I hadn't seen her</i>
      <i> in three years,</i>

02:44.532 --> 02:48.367
<i> but now that I was a freshman,</i>
<i> I was back in her world.</i>

02:48.369 --> 02:50.536
   So many confusing feelings.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.437
 That's all in the past, bro.

02:52.439 --> 02:53.438
 We're in the now,

02:53.440 --> 02:55.941
 and that means
 you got to go rock that body.

02:55.943 --> 02:56.542
 Don't do that.

02:56.544 --> 02:59.211
 You already
 laid the groundwork when
 you were a small child.

02:59.213 --> 02:59.645
    Close the deal.

02:59.647 --> 03:02.581
          How? She's a junior.
          I'm just a boy.

03:02.583 --> 03:03.315
    Not anymore.

03:03.317 --> 03:05.284
 Back then, you were
 just a creepy kid.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.953
 Now you're a man,
 so it's not creepy at all.

03:07.955 --> 03:08.754
 Nope, still creepy.

03:08.756 --> 03:11.223
 Just walk on over there
 and be like,

03:11.225 --> 03:12.424
 "Yo, Waffles, remember me?

03:12.426 --> 03:15.627

 "Name's Adam Goldberg."

03:16.430 --> 03:18.530
         I can't say my name.
         It's too confusing.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.933
    There's another
    Adam Goldberg in school.

03:20.935 --> 03:21.600
            He's a senior.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.869
          He told me
          in no uncertain terms

03:23.871 --> 03:25.704
      that he's got dibs
      on the upper-class girls.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.940
 Stop using the other
 Adam Goldberg as an excuse.

03:27.942 --> 03:31.443
 Yeah, there's just
 so many other reasons
 why it won't work.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.979
          (SCOFFS) What do
          you know about girls?

03:33.981 --> 03:36.415
 Look, all you got to do
 is show her

03:36.417 --> 03:38.250
  that older women
  don't intimidate you.

03:38.252 --> 03:40.919
     You're right!
     It's all about confidence!

03:40.921 --> 03:43.722
               Oh, crap,
               here she comes.

               I'm a man now.

      Oh, my God!
      Uh...Alan, right?

03:52.900 --> 03:55.500
      You used to come by
      the House of Waffles.

            I am Alan, yes.

 of opening bands.

               You can change,
               and you will.

13:02.983 --> 13:04.249
 It's an impossible ask.

13:04.251 --> 13:05.350
     To start, you're taking me
     to Chi-Chi's,

13:05.352 --> 13:09.254
      and I'm finally gonna try
      those sizzlin' fa-jee-tas
      everybody's raving about.

13:09.256 --> 13:12.190
 You know my rule
 about Mexican food.
 Can't do it.

13:12.192 --> 13:12.924
        That's the whole point.

13:12.926 --> 13:17.796
     You won't eat Mexican food
     'cause once you had bad
     nachos at a Phillies game.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.030
   There was a war
   inside me, Bevy.

13:19.032 --> 13:22.467
           That's on you
           for ordering beans
           and liquid cheese

13:22.469 --> 13:24.435
          in an outdoor stadium
          in July.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.937
 I reject all Mexican foods
 forever.

13:25.939 --> 13:29.874
      We're going to Chi-Chi's,
      and you're gonna like it!

13:30.343 --> 13:32.377
        Hyah, hyah, hyah, hyah!

13:33.380 --> 13:34.979
 (YAWNING) Oh, my God.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.182
 Jordan's frat
 threw this sick rager,

13:37.184 --> 13:38.516
 and I was out till,
 like, dawn.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.151
 The best parties
 are always at Omega Sig.

13:40.153 --> 13:45.256
          Wait. My cousin Brett
          goes to Villanova,
          and he's Omega.

13:45.258 --> 13:45.990
        Oh? Wow!

13:45.992 --> 13:49.227
               Yeah, I thought
               they can't have
               parties anymore

13:49.229 --> 13:51.162
             since T-Bone
             fell off the roof.

13:51.164 --> 13:55.300
 Maybe it's not Omega Sig.
 It's Omega Beta.

13:55.302 --> 13:56.601
 That's right. I'm tired.

13:56.603 --> 13:57.869
           Actually, Omega Beta
           is a sorority.

13:57.871 --> 14:00.238
         Yeah, we know because
         they put out
         a calendar every year.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.407
   It's quite tasteful,
   and the proceeds
   go to charity.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.210
      You don't know which frat
      your boyfriend's in?

14:05.212 --> 14:08.112
       Wait. Fast.
       What color are his eyes?

14:08.114 --> 14:09.180
         Breen.
                  Breen?

14:09.182 --> 14:12.217
           Oh, my God, are you
           George Glass-ing us?

14:12.219 --> 14:12.584
 George what?

14:12.586 --> 14:14.886

 what you're talking about.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.454
      Come on. Erica,
      of all people,

14:16.456 --> 14:17.488
   wouldn't need to make up
   a boyfriend.

14:17.490 --> 14:21.226
    Thank you, Geoff.
    I mean, I've never even
    seen <i> The Brady Bunch.</i>

14:21.228 --> 14:22.360

              just referenced

14:22.362 --> 14:25.430
     the thing you said
     you didn't know,
     so now I feel sad for you.

         combine two names from
         New Kids on the Block!

14:31.338 --> 14:31.636
                  So cute.

14:31.638 --> 14:35.874
 It's not cute.
 It's real, and it's college,
 and breen is a color.

14:35.876 --> 14:38.042
 It's brown mixed with green,
 so suck it.

14:38.044 --> 14:43.081
          Well, I guess
          we'll believe it if
          and when we meet him.

14:44.184 --> 14:48.953
         You know, my Nana says
         that sometimes
         wishing makes it so.

 Your pity makes it worse.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.123

 doing any better?

14:59.199 --> 15:03.134
    In fact, I am.
    I have a romantic paintball
    date with Waffle Girl.

15:03.136 --> 15:05.036
  How is paintball
  romantic in any way?

15:05.038 --> 15:07.338
     Trust me, our love will be
     forged on the battlefield

15:07.340 --> 15:12.510
         once she witnesses
         my unflinching courage
         and legendary bravery.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.913
    (SCREAMS) I'm so scared!

15:14.915 --> 15:16.180

        my hand a little.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.494

15:29.496 --> 15:30.628

    we can have

15:30.630 --> 15:32.964

 being a stubborn grump?

15:32.966 --> 15:34.666
             I have to admit,
             it's not that bad.

     And the chicken fajita
     for the lovely <i> senorita.</i>

      And for the <i> senor...</i>

          the steak fa-jee-tas.

 Uh, no more steak fajitas.

      No more steak fa-jee-tas?
 Murray, chicken's fine.

15:47.981 --> 15:50.515
     Those people over there,
     they were seated after us,

15:50.517 --> 15:51.950
             and they got their
             steak fa-jee-tas.

15:51.952 --> 15:55.353
 This dinner is
 supposed to show me
 how not stubborn you are.

 Don't ruin it by being
 extra stubborn.

            gonna happen.

         You're gonna go
         to every table
         with steak fa-jee-tas,

16:01.628 --> 16:05.263
      take one off their plate,
      put it on my plate.

16:05.265 --> 16:05.997

 or I'm going home.

               Well, then go...
        Excuse me.

16:11.438 --> 16:17.075
        Because I'm not leaving
        until my fa-jee-tas
        are good and steaked.

 See, Bevy?
 It all worked out.

16:20.113 --> 16:23.548
 We didn't get fa-jee-tas,
 but we got something
 even better,

      as bad as me.

16:40.734 --> 16:44.302
 and refuses to leave
 until they change it?
                Me, but...

   And who had
   a two-hour standoff
   at the deli counter

   turkey breasts?

16:49.509 --> 16:52.343

           paper-thin meats.

    And who argued
    about the warranty

16:54.214 --> 16:58.750
 of a decade-old
 washing machine and
 somehow got it replaced?

16:58.752 --> 17:01.219
       I didn't do those things
       for me, Murray!

17:01.221 --> 17:02.653
            I did them for
            the people I love!

17:02.655 --> 17:05.356
    So, yes, I'm stubborn
    when it comes to my family.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.726
  But you? You're only stubborn
  for the things you want.

17:08.728 --> 17:10.762
            And that's not just
            being stubborn.

20:01.367 --> 20:05.303
    I don't even know her name,
    and she thinks mine's Alan.

20:05.305 --> 20:08.239
          But you and Geoff,
          that's the real deal.

20:08.241 --> 20:10.875
  ADULT ADAM: <i> No one's perfect</i>
 <i> when it comes to family.</i>

20:10.877 --> 20:13.644
         Easy.
         I'm still really sore.

20:13.646 --> 20:13.945
                (CHUCKLES)

20:13.947 --> 20:16.581
  <i> Sometimes we lie,</i>
  <i> sometimes we're stubborn.</i>

20:16.583 --> 20:18.616
<i> Sometimes we get so caught up</i>
<i> in ourselves</i>

20:18.618 --> 20:21.552
 <i> that we forget</i>
 <i> to look out for each other.</i>

20:21.554 --> 20:27.825
     Oh, that's the Beach Boys.
     Who was I thinking of?

20:27.827 --> 20:29.260
            The Monkees.

20:29.262 --> 20:30.328
 Ah, yeah, they're funny.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.730
  Maybe they'll be
  at the next Live Aid.

20:32.732 --> 20:33.898
   ADULT ADAM:
  <i> But that's family for you.</i>

20:33.900 --> 20:38.002
  <i> In the end, God only knows</i>
  <i> where we'd be</i>
  <i> without each other.</i>

20:38.004 --> 20:40.338
 Punchy, punchy,
 kick, kick!

20:41.808 --> 20:42.740
 MURRAY: No, man,
 don't do that.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.676
 I tried to park,
 and you jumped
 into the parking spot.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.311
          (BELL DINGS)

20:48.314 --> 20:48.779
            Yeah, that's great.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.915
  I got 20 other people
  who could say the same thing.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.417
        You don't got a camera.
   Do you?

20:53.419 --> 20:55.553
                           Yes.
 Come on down with it.

20:55.555 --> 20:58.689
 I got what I want.
                       Hi, Mom.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.628
      You made some headway
      on Operation Waffle Girl.

21:03.630 --> 21:06.764
      Only took you four years,
      but worth the wait.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.032
 I want to
 ask her out again,

21:08.034 --> 21:09.800
 preferably to something
 not painful.

21:09.802 --> 21:13.471
 Oh, no, you don't, Mister.
 No more Waffle Girl.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.439
 She is much too old
 for you.

21:15.441 --> 21:18.776
 Mom, I'm an actual man now,
 a man with needs.

21:18.778 --> 21:22.813
 And I'm gonna show Waffle Girl
 just how much of a man I am,

21:22.815 --> 21:24.649
       and it's gonna get
       so freaky that she...

21:24.651 --> 21:27.652
    She's right there
    behind me, isn't she?

21:28.321 --> 21:30.888
 I'll come back
 in another four years.
