WEBVTT

00:05.839 --> 00:08.986
Well! That was some county fair!

00:09.023 --> 00:11.709
And they really went all loud with the musical entertainment.

00:11.747 --> 00:14.838
I mean, the Beach Girls were fabulous.

00:14.862 --> 00:19.121
I've never seen the Beach Boys but I
can not imagine they are any better.

00:19.145 --> 00:21.364
Ah, the only thing worse than listening to those Beach Whales

00:21.399 --> 00:25.908
was watching Steven throw up after spending all day in the beer-garden.

00:26.671 --> 00:28.456
I had a good reason to throw up.

00:28.996 --> 00:30.182
I was drunk.

00:31.567 --> 00:34.597
Oh, I wish I could say I've been drunk the whole time I went out with you.

00:34.646 --> 00:36.740
Oh, yeah. It's a good think you're not a drinker.

00:36.783 --> 00:39.447
You'd have a hard time operating that heavy machinery...

00:39.756 --> 00:40.965
your mouth!

00:42.664 --> 00:46.916
Well, I had a great time. I have an invisible dog in a leash,

00:47.029 --> 00:51.133
a goldfish in a bag and a giant stuffed panda,

00:51.406 --> 00:53.630
of course I got some stupid stuff too.

00:54.126 --> 00:56.540
You now, Fez, you should be thanking Randy.

00:56.875 --> 00:59.581
You were so amazing winning all that stuff.

00:59.766 --> 01:03.143
With you hair flowing, your muscles rippling,

01:03.176 --> 01:07.080
you were like a Greek god of knocking things over.

01:07.257 --> 01:10.042
Oh help, bazarus Knockoverus.

01:12.266 --> 01:13.393
I'm still drunk.

01:15.497 --> 01:18.393
So how did you get so go at popping
balloons with darts?

01:18.687 --> 01:20.903
Well, when my parents got divorced,

01:20.938 --> 01:24.642
I found comfort in the community of non judgment carnaval workers.

01:24.816 --> 01:27.571
I taught them to read, in exchange

01:27.618 --> 01:30.023
they taught me how to play their game with chance.

01:30.057 --> 01:32.461
- Really?
- No, I got a dart board.

01:32.816 --> 01:35.040
Well, you won every game in the place.

01:35.257 --> 01:38.881
Donna, it must be nice to finally have a boyfriend who can swing that sledge hammer

01:38.918 --> 01:42.301
and get that little black thing passed « seriously hit. »

01:43.057 --> 01:47.101
Now, you shush. Eric always did very well at the fair.

01:47.137 --> 01:51.292
Every time he went to that one booth, he
walked away with his stuffed animal.

01:51.356 --> 01:53.033
That was the gift shop.

01:53.945 --> 01:56.492
Well, Mrs Forman, you won a prize too.

01:56.527 --> 01:59.040
I cant' believe you let that guy guess your weight.

01:59.118 --> 02:02.113
And I can't believe the woman who almost married my son

02:02.157 --> 02:07.290
has already moved on to the next customer
because she is as loose as an old Jim sock.

02:08.576 --> 02:10.501
Whorus Maximus!

02:11.578 --> 02:15.330
And that weight guesser never had a chance once I took off my shoes,

02:15.367 --> 02:17.771
my belt, my engagement ring,

02:17.808 --> 02:20.980
spit up my gum and took out all the kleenex had in my pockets.

02:21.087 --> 02:23.820
Oh Fez, honey, you never gave me back my ring.

02:23.857 --> 02:24.700
Oh, yeah.

02:27.836 --> 02:29.843
Wow, so sparkly...

02:33.377 --> 02:34.840
and last forever.

03:16.835 --> 03:20.581
It's gone! My engagement ring is gooone.

03:20.775 --> 03:22.710
You! You lost it!

03:22.757 --> 03:24.981
We let you in in our country, we

03:25.018 --> 03:29.141
we give you minimal wage jobs, we teach
you how to use a knife and a fork,

03:29.177 --> 03:31.181
and this is how you thank us?

03:32.416 --> 03:36.800
Kitty I hate to see you so upset when
there is such an easy solution.

03:36.828 --> 03:39.741
Let's just get your home, I'll make you a Martini,

03:39.787 --> 03:42.863
then when you calm down,
I'll make you a Margarita.

03:43.966 --> 03:46.382
Wait, uhm, what about us?

03:46.726 --> 03:48.910
Oh you're going to stay here and look for the ring.

03:49.988 --> 03:53.270
And if it rains, just do like the Indians did,

03:53.325 --> 03:54.311
die!

03:59.277 --> 04:00.241
Okay,

04:00.617 --> 04:03.610
well, the ring must have rolled down the hill,
which means, it's been

04:03.636 --> 04:05.550
probably eaten by a squirrel.

04:07.196 --> 04:09.011
We need to find this squirrel,

04:09.307 --> 04:10.941
feed him laxatives...

04:14.655 --> 04:16.583
and wait for the show to begin.

04:20.026 --> 04:22.990
God, we're stuck out here. It's a bummer.

04:23.086 --> 04:27.442
I've been waiting to take you me ever since you threw
that ping pong ball into the floating tea cup.

04:28.046 --> 04:31.863
Maybe we can sneak off. You know, the woods can be pretty romantic.

04:31.908 --> 04:34.863
That is unless you run into a serial killer,

04:34.907 --> 04:37.442
or a witch who lives in a house made of candy.

04:38.805 --> 04:41.582
Hey,  you guys. I was thinking that maybe

04:41.605 --> 04:44.651
we 'd find the ring faster if we split up in teams.

04:44.688 --> 04:46.850
Say, Donna! It's a great idea!

04:46.877 --> 04:49.813
But who may I ask would go with whom?

04:51.135 --> 04:52.653
I get Donna.

04:52.848 --> 04:57.082
Well, that way, if we run up into a bear,
I can just climb you.

05:00.708 --> 05:04.043
No, I was thinking I would go with Randy
and you would go with Hyde.

05:04.085 --> 05:07.030
No, no, no I am not teaming up with Steven.

05:07.115 --> 05:11.301
That would be like Cher teaming up
with the really smelly drunk.

05:12.238 --> 05:14.300
Wow, guys, did you hear that?

05:14.598 --> 05:17.263
The wild core brown hair pygmy bitch.

05:19.255 --> 05:20.832
I didn't hear anything.

05:20.885 --> 05:22.051
There it is again.

05:28.845 --> 05:30.690
Man, this is what it's all about.

05:30.745 --> 05:34.320
The outdoors, just us guys, talking man to man.

05:34.358 --> 05:38.053
You know, Jackie is so annoying. I never
realized when we were going out.

05:38.138 --> 05:41.140
Sometimes you got to marry a striper
to get things into perspective.

05:44.287 --> 05:47.380
Anyway, this is good. The outdoors,

05:47.447 --> 05:51.601
just us guys, talking man to man,
this is what's all about.

05:52.315 --> 05:54.880
Yeahhh, hey can I team up with Donna?

05:55.415 --> 05:58.250
What? No! It's all about the guys!

05:58.905 --> 06:01.191
Oh, man, I can't get between you and Donna

06:01.246 --> 06:03.980
'cause love that's what it's all about...

06:05.187 --> 06:06.392
and drugs...

06:08.488 --> 06:10.120
specially drugs,

06:10.758 --> 06:14.443
then love, but mostly drugs.
You know what I mean, man?

06:20.638 --> 06:21.651
Silence!

06:22.766 --> 06:24.050
That's what it's all about.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.683
Oh, this is just awful.

06:33.205 --> 06:35.512
- Fine, I'll add more gin.
- No!

06:38.516 --> 06:41.572
Red, the ring. And you know, this is all your fault.

06:41.596 --> 06:44.173
If you hadn't driven like a mad man over a pothole,

06:44.206 --> 06:48.132
I wouldn't be drinking to calm my nerves,
I would just be drinking.

06:49.955 --> 06:51.032
Hey!

06:52.025 --> 06:56.640
I am not the one who gave his engagement
ring to the foreign kid.

06:58.425 --> 07:01.003
You're lucky he's not wearing it through his nose.

07:05.325 --> 07:08.182
Oh, this is just the worse thing ever.

07:08.207 --> 07:10.152
Kitty, it is just a ring.

07:10.185 --> 07:12.783
I am talking about the drink.

07:15.795 --> 07:20.442
Hey, there. I was just putting out the thrash
and heard you two had a little spat so

07:20.478 --> 07:23.263
I figured out you'd probably want
me to come and take a side.

07:24.506 --> 07:28.423
Okay, well, my engagement ring is lost
and Red doesn't give a damn.

07:28.468 --> 07:32.713
And I don't understand it because even if he doesn't
care about the sentimental value,

07:32.738 --> 07:35.162
it still cost a thousand dollars.

07:35.295 --> 07:36.641
A thousand bucks?

07:37.167 --> 07:39.740
So you finally replaced the old cheap one, eh?

07:46.755 --> 07:48.460
- Boooob...
- What?

07:49.757 --> 07:51.260
Oh, jeez.

07:53.458 --> 07:55.190
You blew it now, Red.

07:57.596 --> 08:01.061
The old cheap one, what's he talking about, Red?

08:01.157 --> 08:02.023
Kitty,

08:03.355 --> 08:04.322
I love you.

08:06.645 --> 08:09.012
How much did my ring really cost?

08:10.005 --> 08:12.073
Right around a thousand dollars.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.860
How much exactly? 

08:15.896 --> 08:17.710
65 dollars.

08:19.505 --> 08:24.510
65 dollars? My hairdo costs more than that!

08:25.508 --> 08:28.251
It does? Where the hell are you getting...

08:30.126 --> 08:33.909
which is besides the point because you look lovely.

08:34.998 --> 08:37.212
And you know what else looks lovely?

08:37.955 --> 08:39.993
The view from the couch,

08:40.837 --> 08:45.201
which is where you cheap lying butt
will be sleeping tonight.

08:47.946 --> 08:49.851
She's  right about that couch.

08:49.885 --> 08:52.722
You got a great view of the TV from there.

09:00.328 --> 09:02.270
Steven  is such a jerk.

09:02.315 --> 09:06.830
You know, I can't believe I almost married a guy
who can burp the alphabet all the way to W.

09:07.678 --> 09:10.343
You know, he never finishes anything.

09:12.807 --> 09:15.703
Well, Randy is perfect.

09:15.737 --> 09:17.841
That lady at the fair, who did the caricatures,

09:17.886 --> 09:20.903
she refused to draw him because she couldn't find a flaw.

09:20.938 --> 09:25.240
Oh, please, that lady had no talent.

09:25.283 --> 09:28.377
Did you see how big she drew my mouth?

09:31.896 --> 09:33.305
- Hey!
- Hey.

09:33.334 --> 09:35.766
- Any luck finding that ring?
- No

09:35.799 --> 09:40.240
but we did find a broken high heel, some old stockings
and an empty pack of Marlboro's.

09:40.278 --> 09:43.912
Yeah, so it looks like Steven's mom has been here too.

09:44.845 --> 09:48.013
They're not my mom! She smoked Lucky's.

09:49.118 --> 09:53.102
Well, maybe it's time we shake up search parties.
I'll flip a coin.

09:53.138 --> 09:55.933
Head means Donna, tale means Jackie.

09:56.356 --> 09:59.370
It's head, Donna, come on.

09:59.598 --> 10:03.102
Wait, no, no, hum I can't go with Steven.
He's a disgusting pig.

10:03.378 --> 10:07.791
Yeah, she's a suck-up princess who only
cares about looks and money.

10:07.825 --> 10:10.743
Oh, don't try to sweet-talk me.

10:13.315 --> 10:17.273
Okay, look, we're not going to find that stupid ring
anyway so let's just get out of here.

10:18.208 --> 10:19.483
Where is Fez?

10:25.368 --> 10:26.532
Well, Goldy,

10:29.368 --> 10:32.871
it seems we are lost in a dark, cold, lonely cave.

10:35.195 --> 10:36.683
You look scared too,

10:38.566 --> 10:40.720
your eyes are bugging out of your head.

10:44.037 --> 10:45.400
But I'm glad you're here

10:45.485 --> 10:48.083
cause at least I can have a conversation with a fish.

10:49.015 --> 10:50.923
Otherwise I'd be loosing my mind.

10:58.285 --> 10:59.230
FEZ!

11:00.546 --> 11:02.140
Where is he?

11:02.178 --> 11:03.390
Oh, don't worry,

11:03.436 --> 11:07.650
he survived his trip over here in a banana crave,
he'll be fine in the woods.

11:11.925 --> 11:13.851
Actually, I'm kind of worried about him:

11:13.905 --> 11:15.532
it's dark, it's cold,

11:15.785 --> 11:18.241
there's no pornography anywhere.

11:19.848 --> 11:21.031
What was that?

11:21.566 --> 11:23.650
That was a wild Canadian boar.

11:24.857 --> 11:27.011
They feed them likeable girls.

11:28.168 --> 11:29.152
You're safe.

11:30.236 --> 11:31.191
You know,

11:31.728 --> 11:35.783
being out here like this, without any TV, or magazines

11:35.827 --> 11:39.043
makes me realize how people
500 years ago must have felt.

11:39.416 --> 11:41.091
Incredibly bored.

11:42.805 --> 11:47.080
By the way, Donna. If you're ever lost in the outdoors,
just find the North Star.

11:47.116 --> 11:51.130
It's gentle twinkling will confort you...
as you slowly die.

11:51.707 --> 11:55.471
Oh, eww, what, now we have to
cross a disgusting river?

11:55.505 --> 11:57.152
Jackie, it's a just a creek.

11:57.788 --> 12:02.241
Okay, fine, why don't you take your shoe off,
we'll all get in and raw ourselves across.

12:05.296 --> 12:07.471
- Allow me my lady.
- Thank you.

12:08.446 --> 12:11.900
Oh, eh wait, how I am supposed to get across.

12:12.496 --> 12:14.353
Come across, like you always do,

12:14.668 --> 12:15.972
real bitchy!

12:19.508 --> 12:20.300
Oh

12:20.978 --> 12:22.430
you know what?

12:22.486 --> 12:26.033
Even when we were dating you never
did the gentlemanly thing.

12:26.995 --> 12:28.860
Alright, fine, give me your hand.

12:28.898 --> 12:30.862
No, I'm not touching that hand.

12:30.888 --> 12:33.213
You have been burping in that hand all day.

12:34.158 --> 12:36.651
Come on, you've touched growser things than this.

12:36.705 --> 12:38.851
You went out with Kelso for 4 years.

12:39.285 --> 12:40.132
Oh!

12:42.405 --> 12:45.750
You know what, I'll just get myself across.

12:58.476 --> 13:00.440
That couldn't have worked out any better.

13:03.417 --> 13:06.103
Well, Goldy, if my internal clock is correct,

13:06.388 --> 13:08.382
we've been here either an hour

13:08.675 --> 13:09.840
or a month.

13:15.225 --> 13:17.070
Man, I'm terribly thirsty.

13:24.098 --> 13:27.530
I hope you don't mind, I'm gonna drink
a little bit of your water.

13:42.637 --> 13:44.201
You peed in there.

13:50.735 --> 13:53.013
Well I made Bob go and get the kids.

13:53.046 --> 13:55.881
Maybe they'll find the ring, maybe not, either way

13:55.916 --> 13:57.263
I got rid of Bob.

14:00.127 --> 14:03.090
I can't believe you lied to me about that ring.

14:03.125 --> 14:04.233
Listen Kitty,

14:05.725 --> 14:09.811
when I got home from Korea, I wanted to buy you

14:10.086 --> 14:12.770
the nicest engagement ring ever.

14:13.256 --> 14:15.090
But I wasn't making much money.

14:15.278 --> 14:19.582
And when I realized how long I would
have to save to get that ring,

14:20.108 --> 14:23.463
I just knew I couldn't wait that long
to ask you to marry me.

14:24.437 --> 14:27.930
Well, that's true, I had other offers.

14:28.346 --> 14:33.200
Jimmy Callahan used to call me sweetny and he was absolutely right.

14:34.635 --> 14:38.813
So I bought you the best that I could afford,
I was going to tell you

14:40.096 --> 14:43.021
that we'd get a better ring when we had the money,

14:43.436 --> 14:45.612
but then it all went wrong,

14:46.275 --> 14:47.842
you loved the ring

14:47.886 --> 14:52.173
and you said it must have cost a thousand dollars and you were so excited.

14:52.536 --> 14:54.433
I just couldn't let you down.

14:57.765 --> 14:58.650
Red...

15:00.338 --> 15:01.593
And I'll tell you what.

15:02.585 --> 15:04.691
If the kids don't find the old one,

15:05.156 --> 15:06.470
I'll get you another one,

15:07.047 --> 15:10.601
the kind that you deserve for putting up
with me will all these years.

15:12.967 --> 15:13.792
Well,

15:14.275 --> 15:16.503
I don't want you to sell the house.

15:24.168 --> 15:27.630
Hey Donna, you know when you see
ducks flying in a V formation,

15:27.655 --> 15:30.211
one side longer than the other.
You know what that is?

15:30.246 --> 15:32.031
- No.
- More ducks!

15:35.335 --> 15:38.331
Hey, we lost Jackie and Hyde.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.373
Finally, we're alone.

15:40.778 --> 15:41.781
DONNAAA!

15:45.248 --> 15:46.430
That was magical.

15:46.468 --> 15:48.313
Yeah, I hope I didn't get pregnant.

15:48.858 --> 15:49.763
DONNAAA!

15:51.515 --> 15:53.641
Hey, you guys missed it!

15:53.676 --> 15:55.332
Jackie fell in the creek.

15:56.375 --> 15:58.051
Will you shut up?

15:58.096 --> 16:00.682
I could get pneumonia and die.

16:01.908 --> 16:03.691
This keeps getting funnier.

16:05.096 --> 16:07.673
Alright but we still need to find Fez. So

16:07.725 --> 16:09.911
why don't the girls stay here, Hyde and I are
going to look for him.

16:09.967 --> 16:11.500
Oh, I have a better idea.

16:11.836 --> 16:13.653
Let's get some meat ball sup,

16:15.846 --> 16:17.282
go to a strip-club.

16:18.717 --> 16:20.880
Come on buddy, let's go find Fez.

16:21.096 --> 16:23.041
Well, maybe Fez has a meat ball sup.

16:25.345 --> 16:26.173
Okay,

16:26.887 --> 16:30.271
I've been holding this for like 3 hours
and I can't do it anymore.

16:30.308 --> 16:32.410
Yeah,  I know you like Randy,

16:32.448 --> 16:35.753
you're jealous of my hair, bla bla bla.

16:36.665 --> 16:41.161
No, I drank to much and now I have to like go, 
so be my look-out.

16:41.418 --> 16:43.221
You know, if this were a mall,

16:43.367 --> 16:45.303
you'd be in a bathroom right now.

16:45.818 --> 16:49.752
Of course you wouldn't be in a mall cause you might
accidentally put on some new clothes.

16:51.118 --> 16:53.590
Wait a minute, man, this looks familiar.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.631
Like we just did a complete circle.

16:55.946 --> 16:57.562
- Woh...
- Oh my God!

17:00.296 --> 17:02.853
No, I'd remember this.

17:10.458 --> 17:12.682
I win again!

17:15.276 --> 17:18.353
I  know you're just a fish, but come on! At least try!

17:19.986 --> 17:22.223
Fez, is that you?

17:23.236 --> 17:25.161
Goldy, you can use pronouns?

17:28.696 --> 17:30.583
No, Fez, it's me Bob!

17:30.708 --> 17:33.563
Bob, you find us! Alleluia!

17:33.895 --> 17:37.713
Yeap, I just followed the trail of candy corn you left.

17:38.898 --> 17:40.591
But I didn't leave a...

17:41.288 --> 17:42.761
oh, dammit!

17:44.108 --> 17:47.860
There was a hole. All that candy corn wasted.

17:47.915 --> 17:48.971
No, I ate 'em.

17:51.508 --> 17:53.743
Bob, they were on the ground!

17:54.728 --> 17:56.133
Well, I would have done the same.

18:03.027 --> 18:06.070
Donna, you don't have to be embarrassed, man.
It's over.

18:06.157 --> 18:07.642
Nobody cares.

18:07.698 --> 18:11.433
In fact let's just sing a little camp fire song,
alright I start.

18:11.785 --> 18:15.390
<i>«Twinkle, twinkle little star,</i>

18:15.438 --> 18:18.963
<i>Donna wees behind a bush.»</i>

18:21.657 --> 18:23.540
I just couldn't hold it anymore.

18:25.008 --> 18:27.890
Why did I get the 48 ounce commemorative cup?

18:28.706 --> 18:32.863
Why didn't I go in the 48 ounce commemorative cup?

18:33.497 --> 18:38.281
I'm not sure that relieving yourself in a cup would
have made this any less humiliating.

18:38.878 --> 18:41.472
This, this is why I hate the woods.

18:41.506 --> 18:43.602
Every thing's a bathroom.

18:43.636 --> 18:45.492
God, it's just like Delaware.

18:46.078 --> 18:50.201
Oh! That reminds me of an old Delawarian folk song.

18:50.857 --> 18:54.402
<i>«Donna squatted in a bush, pee pee, doo doo,</i>

18:54.446 --> 18:57.862
<i>Donna squatted in a bush pee pee all day long.»</i>

19:03.717 --> 19:05.972
<i>- Oh when the saints..
- Oh when the saints.</i>

19:05.998 --> 19:08.102
<i>- go marching in..
- go marching in.</i>

19:08.137 --> 19:12.131
<i>Oh when the saints go marching in.</i>

19:12.198 --> 19:13.040
Dad?

19:13.318 --> 19:17.791
<i>Oh Lord, I want to be in that number,</i>

19:17.826 --> 19:22.242
<i>Oh when the saints go marching in...</i>

19:22.705 --> 19:26.141
My dad and Fez are skipping through the woods.

19:28.696 --> 19:30.592
And I peed on a bush.

19:31.898 --> 19:34.202
I really should have gone to college.

19:40.245 --> 19:42.581
Alright Jackie, I'll help you get across the creek.

19:42.617 --> 19:44.763
Will you just leave me alone?

19:44.787 --> 19:46.221
Want to fall in again?

19:47.816 --> 19:48.693
Fine.

19:57.698 --> 19:58.502
Steven!

20:01.028 --> 20:03.313
Man, I hope I'll remember that in the morning.

20:08.306 --> 20:11.001
It's too bad, the kids never found your ring.

20:11.045 --> 20:13.932
But on the upside,
Pork Doodles!

20:18.796 --> 20:20.493
Oh, my Gosh!

20:20.947 --> 20:23.292
Oh my Gosh! It's my ring!

20:23.325 --> 20:26.093
It was in the car the whole time.

20:27.388 --> 20:29.110
Oh that's great!

20:29.137 --> 20:32.833
It's like I always say: sometimes you find things!

20:34.148 --> 20:34.991
Kitty!

20:35.956 --> 20:36.823
Red!

20:36.996 --> 20:39.923
I've just ordered you a new ring.

20:40.085 --> 20:41.870
The diamond is almost a carat.

20:41.908 --> 20:45.323
The band is white gold. The jeweller said it was the nicest one he had.

20:45.585 --> 20:46.363
Oh...

20:48.817 --> 20:51.021
Well... That sounds beautiful.

20:51.807 --> 20:55.381
I know it won't have all sentimental
value of the old one, but..

20:55.427 --> 20:58.233
But that ring is gone forever.

21:03.768 --> 21:07.323
Goldy, it's not right to keep you in a tiny bag like this.

21:07.825 --> 21:10.000
A goldfish belongs in the wild.

21:10.696 --> 21:12.502
Never easy to say goodbye,

21:13.006 --> 21:14.593
specially to a fish.

21:15.285 --> 21:16.842
I am not sure where your ears are.

21:18.196 --> 21:19.231
There you go.

21:22.496 --> 21:24.423
Swim Goldy, swim.

21:30.006 --> 21:31.831
Fly Goldy, fly.
