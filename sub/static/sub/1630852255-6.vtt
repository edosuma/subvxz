I don't know about
me and downtown.

Buckle up, princess.
I'm rebounding,

01:51.778 --> 01:53.905
and I'm gonna be
one of those people
who talks about it a lot.

01:53.988 --> 01:58.409

out a cute kayak

02:14.968 --> 02:16.970
Well, you are the strongest
swimmer of the three of us.

02:17.053 --> 02:19.848

breeze off the water

02:19.931 --> 02:22.225

staying where you are?

So, a lot of my other
graduate students

06:13.873 --> 06:15.500
are devoting time
to the renovation,

Oh. I know.
They gotta put
their kids to bed.

06:56.290 --> 06:59.836
Okay, I got it.
Honey, I gotta go.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.754
Yeah, nothin' but love.
Okay, bye.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.341
What?

07:05.424 --> 07:07.343
Nobody has time
for a casual dinner

07:07.426 --> 07:11.681
with Andre Rashad's best friend
and his wife, Fertile Myrtle.

07:11.764 --> 07:12.390
I know the type.

07:13.349 --> 07:15.726
-Left to right.
-Okay.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.395
She's had two babies
in three years,

07:17.478 --> 07:18.437
and every single
conversation,

07:18.521 --> 07:21.858
she manages, somehow,
to bring it back to babies.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.401
I mean, we could be
talkin' about Mars,

07:23.484 --> 07:25.903
and she'll suddenly say,
"Oh, I-- The night
that I saw Mars,

07:25.987 --> 07:27.405
"through the telescope
was the night that we

07:27.488 --> 07:29.198
got pregnant
with Jasmine."

07:29.282 --> 07:31.784
And I said to Andre,
"Honey, please give
me a little space

07:31.868 --> 07:34.620
on the baby decision after
the second round of IVF."

07:35.830 --> 07:38.166
She's gonna bring
it up... a lot.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.668
Since when are you shy?

07:40.751 --> 07:42.211
Just control
the conversation.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.547
-Don't let her go there.
-I've tried, Miranda.

07:44.630 --> 07:49.385
-You don't know Fertile Myrtle.
-What's her real name?

07:49.468 --> 07:51.888
Myrtle.
She was conceived
in Myrtle Beach.

07:51.971 --> 07:54.473
(laughs)
No!

07:54.557 --> 07:56.517
Welcome to my SoHo.

07:59.395 --> 08:01.105
Okay...

08:01.189 --> 08:03.983
These clothes...
This holiday.

08:04.066 --> 08:07.445
I, I need to know
everything about it.

08:09.864 --> 08:12.200
In India, Diwali is
a Hindu celebration

08:12.283 --> 08:14.285
of light triumphing
over dark.

08:14.368 --> 08:16.245
In Queens,
it's the celebration

08:16.329 --> 08:19.040
of my family asking me
why I'm still not married.

08:19.123 --> 08:22.543
But, there's so much more
about you to celebrate.

08:22.627 --> 08:26.255
-Literally, everything
else about you.
-And they do,

08:26.339 --> 08:27.423
but my parents hit
the arranged marriage lottery,

08:27.506 --> 08:30.927
and they can't imagine
me not having that.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.094
But it's my life,
and I'm happy,

08:32.178 --> 08:33.596
so they have
to get over it,

08:33.679 --> 08:35.806
and accept their
bad Indian daughter.

08:37.892 --> 08:41.020
Question.
If your parents
won the lottery,

08:41.102 --> 08:43.648
have you ever considered
an arranged marriage?

08:43.731 --> 08:48.694
Carrie, I won't even let
the sommelier pick out my wine.

08:48.778 --> 08:49.904
They are so sickeningly happy

08:49.987 --> 08:52.782
that every time I push back
on one of their choices for me,

08:52.865 --> 08:56.452
I get,
"Your father and I weren't
in love at first sight either,

08:56.535 --> 08:57.954
but we grew to love each other."

08:58.037 --> 09:00.289
If I have to convince
myself to love someone,

09:00.373 --> 09:01.624
then I don't want them.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.584
Oh yeah, no.
There are two
things no one

09:03.668 --> 09:07.338
should ever be talked into:
love and zip-lining.

09:07.421 --> 09:09.298
One of my most favorite
Fendi sandals is still

09:09.382 --> 09:11.842
somewhere in that rainforest.

09:11.926 --> 09:15.680
So, until I find my man,
I'll buy a stunning sari

09:15.763 --> 09:18.474
and attend another
family Diwali alone.

09:19.767 --> 09:24.063
Well, you know, you don't
have to attend alone.

09:24.146 --> 09:28.359
I could really use
a light triumphing
over dark celebration.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.528
Let's get you a sari.

09:31.445 --> 09:32.530
Is that allowed?

09:32.613 --> 09:34.991
You're wearing it to
a traditional celebration

09:35.074 --> 09:36.909
at my family home.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.494
That's not cultural
appropriation,

09:38.577 --> 09:40.830
that's cultural appreciation.

09:40.913 --> 09:44.000
Oh my god...
Wow, that is really great

09:44.083 --> 09:45.376
'cause I just saw
one back there that

09:45.459 --> 09:48.296
I really culturally
appreciated.

09:52.717 --> 09:54.677
Ooh.

09:54.760 --> 09:58.597
Anyone who said
a marriage can't fit
neatly into boxes...

09:58.681 --> 10:01.017
has not seen
my storage unit.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.686
Okay.
What is the goal
for today?

10:03.769 --> 10:05.771
You know, find a few things
to take to the new place,

10:05.855 --> 10:08.399
so, you know,
I can make it...
feel like me,

10:08.482 --> 10:10.401
and then, treat myself
to a hot pretzel

10:10.484 --> 10:13.029
from that vendor
on the corner after.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.532
See, my mistake was
thinking that I had

10:16.615 --> 10:19.285
to fall in love
with a new apartment
right away.

10:19.368 --> 10:20.745
But now I see it...
like an arranged marriage.

10:20.828 --> 10:24.373
You know, you learn to love it
and that's what I plan to do.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.543
-Just a little bit at a time.
-Smart.

10:27.626 --> 10:31.213
It's like you're taking
your time and dating,
like I did in the '90s.

10:31.297 --> 10:35.760
Exactly.
I am dating
my new apartment,

10:35.843 --> 10:38.554
and tonight is
our first sleepover.

10:38.637 --> 10:41.640
I got a bed delivered
from 1-800-Mattress.

10:44.310 --> 10:47.229
(chuckles)
Do you always have
these in your purse?

10:47.313 --> 10:48.856
(Miranda giggles)

10:48.939 --> 10:51.567
So, I suggest we follow
Marie Kondo's advice,

10:51.650 --> 10:54.403
and only take things
that spark joy.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.406
Oh. I don't think joy
is even on the menu here.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.657
Maybe we should just...

10:58.741 --> 11:02.286
try to find things
that don't spark sadness.

11:04.205 --> 11:07.249
-What about this adorable lamp?
-Doesn't make me sad.

11:07.333 --> 11:11.295
-Yay! Good.
-Oh, wow. Conrad's, 1988.

11:12.463 --> 11:17.635
Okay...
If I were sheets,
where would I be?

11:17.718 --> 11:19.887
Ooh, not sheets.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.598
(gasps)
Oh my god!

11:22.681 --> 11:26.435
-It's my favorite sun hat.
-Oh.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.105
Oh. And now she's
not just fashion...

11:29.188 --> 11:31.023
she's survival.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.484
-Definite yes.
-Yay! Good.

11:40.157 --> 11:42.493
-Oh shit.
-What?

11:45.663 --> 11:47.623
-Big's records.
-Oh.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.668
Are you okay?

11:50.751 --> 11:53.629
No. I'm in a spark
sadness situation.

11:54.713 --> 11:56.048
What can I do?

12:02.054 --> 12:04.473
Oh my god.
I--

12:07.435 --> 12:10.479
Oh my god. Thought it--
Suddenly, it was all here again.

12:14.733 --> 12:17.194
(exhales)
And I was feeling so cocky

12:17.278 --> 12:18.696
after I made it past
our headboard over there.

12:24.660 --> 12:26.412
Yeah, I'm not ready for this.
I think you're gonna have to

12:26.495 --> 12:29.373
test run the boxes,
and just tell me
what's in them.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.668
You know, m-maybe,
this is enough for today.

12:32.751 --> 12:36.130
I have tons of sheets,
and we can just go get
ourselves a pretzel.

12:36.213 --> 12:38.757
We can't leave here with
a, a hat and a lamp.

12:41.051 --> 12:43.304
Okay, now we can go.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.347
(salt grinding)

12:45.931 --> 12:48.476
Not too much salt.

12:55.691 --> 13:00.529
(beeping)

13:00.613 --> 13:01.739
(whimsical music playing)

13:04.909 --> 13:30.643
(beeping)

13:30.726 --> 13:34.438
-Okay...
-(beeping)

13:35.981 --> 13:36.732
Cancel.

13:43.489 --> 13:44.532
Hm.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.451
(beeping)

13:50.162 --> 13:51.789
(phone ringing)

13:56.961 --> 13:58.379
(beeping)

13:58.462 --> 14:00.005
-Hello.
-Anthony (on phone):
It's Anthony.

14:00.089 --> 14:04.426
Oh good.
I thought you were
a phone solicitor.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.846
-Then why'd you pick up?
-Eh, I had nothing better to do.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.640
I need a favor...
Three months ago,

14:09.723 --> 14:11.350
Stanford booked
us a consultation

14:11.433 --> 14:13.936
with a plastic surgeon
for His and His facelifts.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.188
Is it too late for me
to not pick up?

14:16.272 --> 14:20.067
Believe me. I hear you.
I was only goin' to stop him
from doin' something crazy.

14:20.150 --> 14:23.070
Now I need you to go to stop me
from doin' something crazy.

14:23.153 --> 14:27.116
Okay, well, now I need you
to stop me from going crazy.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.034
I'm in the new apartment.

14:29.118 --> 14:33.539
There's this beeping,
and I have no idea
where it's coming from.

14:33.622 --> 14:35.833
-Anthony: The dishwasher.
-No, I checked the dishwasher.

14:35.916 --> 14:36.834
Try it again.
It's always the dishwasher.

14:36.917 --> 14:40.004
-Carrie: Okay, hold on.
-Hey. (knocks on glass)

14:40.087 --> 14:41.797
You're holdin' the bags
upside down, Jimmy.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.091
Oh, actually, I'm Billy.
He's Jimmy.

14:44.174 --> 14:45.593
Whoever!
Bags are upside down!

14:45.676 --> 14:48.429
-Jesus Christ!
-Ah, uh, five-second rule?

14:48.512 --> 14:51.056
No! No five-second rule!
Give me that.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.142
-Here you go.
-It's a good thing you're hot.

14:53.225 --> 14:56.103
-Oh, thank you.
-Carrie: No, it's not
the dishwasher.

14:56.186 --> 14:58.063
It's always the dishwasher.
Slam it!

14:59.231 --> 15:01.817
-(slams)
-(beeping)

15:01.900 --> 15:03.402
-Nope.
-Harder!

15:05.195 --> 15:07.114
(beeping)

15:07.197 --> 15:09.533
Could the beeping be
in the refrigerator?

15:09.617 --> 15:11.869
Carrie, I don't have
time to play Clue:
The Kitchen Edition.

15:11.952 --> 15:14.538
Will you please come
with me tomorrow morning?

15:14.622 --> 15:17.875
I trust your judgment,
and Charlotte's up
to her eyeballs in kid shit.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.502
Anthony...
you don't need a facelift.

15:20.586 --> 15:22.880
Tell that to
the 30-year-old hottie that
called me Daddy last night.

15:22.963 --> 15:24.882
I am not ready to be a daddy.

15:24.965 --> 15:28.010
I need to get my face back
to "hot, slightly older guy."

15:28.093 --> 15:30.262
Oh my god.
I think I just
turned off the AC,

15:30.346 --> 15:32.848
and that's a problem
because I live on
the surface of the Sun.

15:32.931 --> 15:36.018
Come! I'm afraid in
my vulnerable state

15:36.101 --> 15:37.686
I'll agree to the whole
shebang and wind up,

15:37.770 --> 15:39.021
to paraphrase Steven Tyler,

15:39.104 --> 15:40.856
like one of those dudes
who looks like a lady.

15:40.939 --> 15:44.443
-Carrie:
Okay, I will go with you.
-Anthony: Thank you. Bye.

15:46.445 --> 15:54.370
(beeping)

15:58.457 --> 16:00.918
(laughs)
Yeah, we come
here all the time.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.211
You're gonna
love this place.

16:02.294 --> 16:03.253
As long as it's not
dinosaur-shaped nuggets

16:03.337 --> 16:06.632
-and mac and cheese, I'm good.
-(all laughing)

16:06.715 --> 16:09.051
-Oh my god. Last night--
-Yeah, it, it used to be

16:09.134 --> 16:11.178
-a shoe factory
in the late 1800s.
-Oh.

16:11.261 --> 16:14.098
Uh, 1890, 1891.
I don't know what
kind of shoes, though.

16:14.181 --> 16:16.392
-(laughs)
-Cool, cool.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.726
Well, last night
at dinner, Jas--

16:17.810 --> 16:19.061
But I think it was
probably men's shoes

16:19.144 --> 16:21.146
because what wasn't about
men back then, right?

16:21.230 --> 16:22.898
I mean,
Congress hadn't even
ratified a woman's

16:22.981 --> 16:25.734
-right to vote until 1919--
-Babe, nah, nah.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.195
Take a breath.
You cut off Myrtle.

16:28.278 --> 16:30.906
-Oh, did I? I'm so sorry.
-It's fine.

16:30.989 --> 16:32.408
All right, so let's get
some of those mojitos.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.702
Oh, I-I'm not drinking.

16:34.785 --> 16:36.995
Why? What, are you
pregnant again?
(laughs)

16:39.248 --> 16:41.291
Oh, wow, you're pregnant again.

16:41.375 --> 16:43.127
Well, we didn't want to
make a big announcement
because--

16:43.210 --> 16:44.628
No, no, it's wonderful.

16:44.712 --> 16:48.215
-Oh my god!
-Congrats, man!

16:48.298 --> 16:51.218
Yeah, three. Three.
Slow down, brother.

16:51.301 --> 16:53.804
-Give someone else a shot.
-Get movin', man.
Pick up the slack.

16:53.887 --> 16:56.932
-Hey, don't say that.
-Oh, right.

16:57.015 --> 16:58.809
-Um, I'm sorry. My bad.
-Sorry.

16:58.892 --> 16:59.852
-It's fine. Yeah, fine.
-You're so fine.

16:59.935 --> 17:03.939
-How's it going?
-Uh, well, you know,

17:04.021 --> 17:04.440
-doin' our thing.
-We're doin' our thing.

17:04.522 --> 17:07.483
Yeah, maybe...

17:07.568 --> 17:10.612
-thinkin' about
another IVF round.
-You know, it's about timing

17:10.695 --> 17:13.949
because I've got my job
and, you know, Andre's
going back out on tour,

17:14.031 --> 17:18.619
and IVF is really
hard on my body,
and it's expensive.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.415
We're tryin' to save money
to buy an apartment,
so it's timing.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.459
It's never a good time
and it's always a good time, so.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.421
A couple like you,
you gotta have babies.

17:29.381 --> 17:30.591
Yeah.

17:31.717 --> 17:41.977
(beeping)

17:42.060 --> 17:43.061
(whimsical music playing)

17:45.355 --> 17:50.694
(beeping)

17:54.072 --> 17:56.784
-(beeping)
-Oh, hi. This is 5D.

17:57.743 --> 18:02.748
Yes, hello.
Um... that beeping's back.

18:02.831 --> 18:05.375
Do you think you could
send maintenance again?

18:07.127 --> 18:11.381
Oh, okay, okay. No, no.
The morning will be fine.

18:12.382 --> 18:14.384
-Okay. Thank you.
-(beeping)

18:16.678 --> 18:17.763
(beeping)

18:17.846 --> 18:19.389
(vibrating)

18:21.809 --> 18:23.894
Inhale.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.731
Can I touch you?

18:27.815 --> 18:29.024
-Is this okay?
-Mm-hm.

18:30.818 --> 18:32.444
Tell me you like it.

18:34.822 --> 18:35.697
Mom?

18:35.781 --> 18:37.074
(vibrator buzzing)

18:38.408 --> 18:40.327
-(knocks on door)
-Brady: Mom?

18:41.203 --> 18:42.830
I'll be right out!

18:43.956 --> 18:46.333
-Are you okay?
-Mm-hm!

18:48.460 --> 18:50.337
I'm gonna go meet Luisa.

18:51.588 --> 18:56.051
Don't stay late!
You have your math tutor
in the morning!

18:57.302 --> 19:01.306
(both moaning)

19:05.060 --> 19:06.353
Oh god.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.357
(kissing)

19:14.987 --> 19:16.530
Okay, if that didn't
put a baby in me,

19:16.613 --> 19:18.365
I don't wanna do
the other thing.

19:18.448 --> 19:22.327
(chuckles)
Oh.

19:22.411 --> 19:24.580
Are you doin' that thing
where you're not talking
'cause you're going through

19:24.663 --> 19:27.082
all the possible
responses in your mind?

19:27.165 --> 19:28.917
No, I'm doin' that thing
where I'm not talkin'

19:29.001 --> 19:29.418
'cause I just came
and I need a minute.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.670
Oh, okay.

19:35.465 --> 19:37.885
Now I'm doing
that thing I'm not talkin'
'cause I'm working through

19:37.968 --> 19:39.177
all the possible
responses in my mind.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.931
I've been nervous
to tell you,
so I've been...

19:43.015 --> 19:45.267
doing everything I can
to avoid the topic.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.979
Is that why you were
talkin' all that crazy shit

19:49.062 --> 19:51.398
about a shoe factory at dinner?

19:51.481 --> 19:55.027
-(laughing)
-No, no, no, no.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.907
You don't ever
need to be nervous.

20:01.199 --> 20:02.326
It's me.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.329
I got you.

20:12.085 --> 20:18.300
(beeping)

20:18.383 --> 20:19.509
(sighs)

20:20.677 --> 20:22.054
(beeping)

20:22.137 --> 20:23.597
This isn't working!

20:25.599 --> 20:27.559
Everyone says
this doctor is the best.

20:27.643 --> 20:31.021
His male patients
look like men,
not mall elves.

20:31.104 --> 20:31.980
(knocks on door)

20:32.064 --> 20:37.069
Good morning.
I'm Dr. Paul David.

20:37.152 --> 20:39.112
-I hope I haven't kept
you waiting too long.
-No.

20:39.196 --> 20:43.408
So... what are
we doing today?

20:44.701 --> 20:46.995
Oh, no.
We're doing him today.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.039
Anthony Marentino, 10:45.

20:49.122 --> 20:51.124
Well, this is
an unfortunate start.

20:51.208 --> 20:54.002
Clearly, my receptionist
screwed up the exam room
numbers again.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.505
She's 22,
and went to Oberlin,

20:56.588 --> 20:58.173
so there's really nothing
I can do about it

20:58.256 --> 20:59.341
without risking a lawsuit.

20:59.424 --> 21:01.635
So...
let's just start over,
shall we?

21:01.718 --> 21:03.470
Sure.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.681
What are we doing today?

21:05.764 --> 21:08.266
I'm here for
a facelift consultation.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.689
You don't need
a facelift.

21:13.772 --> 21:19.152
Maybe... some Botox.
Your number 11s
are approaching 12s,

21:19.236 --> 21:20.862
but, other than that,

21:22.239 --> 21:24.658
nice Italian skin,
good muscle tone.

21:26.576 --> 21:27.619
You're hot.

21:28.870 --> 21:31.081
Best consultation ever.

21:32.332 --> 21:34.292
I would ask my assistant
for help setting up,

21:34.376 --> 21:36.712
but it turns out
needles trigger her.

21:38.296 --> 21:41.049
Um, Dr. Paul David,

21:41.133 --> 21:44.386
what about my number 11s?

21:45.095 --> 21:46.388
I mean, I'm just curious.

21:46.471 --> 21:50.308
-You know, as long as I'm here.
-Absolutely, sure.

21:54.813 --> 21:57.357
Oh, this isn't how
I usually look.

21:57.441 --> 22:00.944
-I didn't sleep
at all last night.
-Hm-mm.

22:01.028 --> 22:04.531
And my husband
died recently,
so...

22:04.614 --> 22:09.411
you know, that's...
a lot of what you're
seeing on my face.

22:12.956 --> 22:14.750
So, what are you thinking?

22:14.833 --> 22:18.420
Oh, I'm just thinking,
like you said,
you look a little tired.

22:18.503 --> 22:21.923
And maybe
you'd be interested
in a little refresh?

22:22.007 --> 22:23.508
A little refresh...

22:24.134 --> 22:26.470
as in more than a nap?

22:26.553 --> 22:28.472
Well, that's
completely up to you.

22:29.639 --> 22:31.516
But you're not saying
I need a facelift?

22:31.600 --> 22:34.436
-Oh, no, no, no.
-Oh... okay.

22:34.519 --> 22:37.898
Well, maybe,
a halflift...
or nothing.

22:37.981 --> 22:39.649
I mean, I think
you look beautiful.

22:40.692 --> 22:45.072
You're what... 48, 49?

22:45.155 --> 22:49.826
-Oh, you're good.
-Listen, I mean,
you're here, I'm here.

22:49.910 --> 22:52.454
Don't worry.
I won't let you
do anything crazy.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.247
You know,
the correct response
would've been,

22:54.331 --> 22:57.250
"You don't need anything."
No good deed.

22:57.334 --> 23:02.255
You know,
he's years older
than me, by the way.

23:02.339 --> 23:05.717
Well, unfortunately,
Mother Nature and Instagram

23:05.801 --> 23:08.303
-are much harder on women.
-Hmm.

23:08.386 --> 23:10.430
You know what?
Why don't we step over here?

23:12.349 --> 23:14.726
I can take a 3D image
of your face

23:14.810 --> 23:18.480
for a simulation
before and after.

23:18.563 --> 23:21.358
God, my legs don't
seem to want to move.

23:23.110 --> 23:23.819
You're fabulous.

23:23.902 --> 23:25.946
Mm-hmm.

23:28.782 --> 23:33.161
So, as the face ages,
it breaks down into
two types of people:

23:33.245 --> 23:34.579
hollowers and saggers.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.998
Hollowers lose volume.

23:37.082 --> 23:40.877
Saggers are prone to
hang and develop bags.

23:40.961 --> 23:44.464
-You're a hollower.
-Does this feeling
come with a Valium?

23:44.548 --> 23:45.632
(chuckles)

23:45.715 --> 23:47.551
-You're hilarious.
-No, I'm serious.

23:50.470 --> 23:52.722
Hey, I came here
to support you during
your moment of need.

23:52.806 --> 23:57.519
You could at least
support me during
my drive-by facelift.

23:57.602 --> 24:01.523
So, Carrie, you have
a wide range of options.

24:01.606 --> 24:02.357
Ah... okay.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.234
Dr. Paul David:
Maybe a few, let's see,

24:04.317 --> 24:07.863
injectables to
restore and plump.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.865
Some laser work.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.784
A bit of surgery,

24:12.868 --> 24:16.371
upper eye
and a mini facelift.

24:16.454 --> 24:18.665
Or, depending on the result
that you're looking for,

24:18.748 --> 24:21.042
a full face
and neck lift,

24:21.126 --> 24:22.502
which would take
you from here...

24:23.837 --> 24:25.881
to...

24:28.633 --> 24:29.718
here.

24:29.801 --> 24:32.846
Oh... I remember her.

24:32.929 --> 24:34.055
Just an idea
of what's possible.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.808
That's friggin' amazing.

24:38.351 --> 24:40.270
With the right work
and the right touch,

24:40.353 --> 24:43.857
the last 15 years...
are gone.

24:48.153 --> 24:48.486
How much?

24:50.197 --> 24:53.033
Fifteen years... gone.

24:53.116 --> 24:55.911
I mean, crazy expensive,
but is it worth it?

24:55.994 --> 24:57.704
I wanna kill
that doctor.

24:57.787 --> 24:59.289
You felt great about
the way you look,

24:59.372 --> 25:00.415
and now, thanks to him,
you're questioning that.

25:00.498 --> 25:02.334
Who said I felt great
about how I look?

25:02.417 --> 25:05.879
Okay, maybe not "great."
Who does?

25:05.962 --> 25:08.465
I mean, what's this?
Who invited this?

25:08.548 --> 25:10.258
See, this is what
they do to women.

25:10.342 --> 25:12.719
They make it wrong
for us to age.

25:12.802 --> 25:15.472
But a woman should
be able to freshen up
without other people

25:15.555 --> 25:19.267
-making them
feel bad about it.
-Who? Me?

25:19.351 --> 25:22.062
Botox and a little filler
are not the end of the world.

25:22.145 --> 25:23.230
-Carrie: Okay, ladies--
-I'm not--

25:23.313 --> 25:25.106
I can't even figure
out the beeping

25:25.190 --> 25:26.650

let alone the

25:26.733 --> 25:28.151
"get work or no work"
labyrinth.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.819
So, I say...

25:29.903 --> 25:31.279

25:31.363 --> 25:34.491
-More bubbly?
-Definitely, yes.
It's delicious.

You guys are sweet.

bullshit with me.

25:39.454 --> 25:41.206
And I must say
I am very proud

25:41.289 --> 25:42.666
of how you have
stopped cold turkey.

25:44.417 --> 25:46.836
Well, before you
get too proud,

25:46.920 --> 25:49.673
I seem to have replaced
too much drinking...

25:49.756 --> 25:51.466
with obsessive masturbation.

25:51.549 --> 25:53.343
-Oh.
-Is it menopause, you think?

25:53.426 --> 25:54.302
Or is it just
my compulsive personality?

25:54.386 --> 25:57.138
Well, I can't
see that I've,

25:57.222 --> 26:00.267
uh, seen a real spike
in my sex drive these days,

26:00.350 --> 26:03.186
-but I might not be
the best control group.
-Oh shit.

If you're not up for hearing

26:04.688 --> 26:07.816

fantasizing about?

26:16.533 --> 26:17.867
Honestly?

26:19.327 --> 26:22.497
-Carrie's boss, Che.
-Oh, yeah, yeah. I get that.

26:22.580 --> 26:24.332
-You do?
-Really?

26:24.416 --> 26:25.959
Oh yeah.

26:26.042 --> 26:29.504
Che is so cool
and charismatic.

26:29.587 --> 26:32.299
In fact, I even had
a sex dream about Che

26:32.382 --> 26:35.260
after that comedy concert.

26:35.343 --> 26:35.719
We were on a ferry.

a fantasy as a replay.

26:47.480 --> 26:48.773
What do you mean?

26:52.068 --> 26:54.321
I'm gonna tell
you something...

26:54.404 --> 26:56.489
and you're gonna have
a big reaction.

26:56.573 --> 26:59.576
-And I'm asking you not to.
-Okay.

27:02.329 --> 27:04.706
I had sex with Che
at Carrie's apartment

27:04.789 --> 27:09.210
after the surgery when
we thought she was asleep.

27:09.294 --> 27:10.378
-What?!
-You had a huge reaction!

27:10.462 --> 27:13.048
Of course,
I had a huge reaction!

27:13.131 --> 27:16.468
Y-You knew?! You knew?!
Say something!

27:18.094 --> 27:21.890
-Cheese?
-We had a big fight,
but we're fine.

27:21.973 --> 27:25.393
-You're fine?!
You're fine with this?
-No, she said, "We're fine."

27:25.477 --> 27:28.271
-Not, "I'm fine."
-Are you not fine with it?

27:28.355 --> 27:29.522
I don't even know
what it is yet.

27:29.606 --> 27:32.025
Well, I don't even know
what it is yet, either.

27:32.108 --> 27:34.402
It is an affair!
That's what it is.

27:34.486 --> 27:37.572

It was a finger.

What? Go ahead! Say it!

27:43.828 --> 27:46.456
I can feel judgment
emanating from your pores.

27:46.539 --> 27:49.000
It's not judgment.
It's surprise.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.418
Am I not allowed
to be surprised?

27:50.502 --> 27:51.753
Miranda:
You are allowed to be
whatever you want!

27:51.836 --> 27:54.589
I just don't want to
focus group this.

27:54.672 --> 27:57.133
Listen, you brought it up,
and we talk about everything,

27:57.217 --> 27:59.469
so you can't just
suddenly change the rules.

27:59.552 --> 28:01.096
That's true.
We should probably
take a vote,

28:01.179 --> 28:02.972
but it will never
pass the Senate.

28:03.056 --> 28:04.599
And, Carrie,
why do you keep trying
to make this nothing?

28:04.682 --> 28:07.435
-It's something!
-No, you know what?

28:07.519 --> 28:12.107
Big dying is something.
This is--

28:12.190 --> 28:13.691
Well, as I said,
I don't know what this is.

28:15.068 --> 28:20.573
-So, are you gay now?
-No... I don't know.

28:20.657 --> 28:23.284
You said yourself,
you were attracted
to Che, too.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.412
It was a dream!
I was on a ferry!

28:25.495 --> 28:26.413
-That's not the same thing.
-And, anyway,

28:26.496 --> 28:28.957
it's not as simple
as gay or straight.

28:29.040 --> 28:32.919
-Che identifies as non-binary.
-Use whatever words you want,

28:33.002 --> 28:35.380
but you spent your
whole life with men.

28:35.463 --> 28:37.632
You're married to a man,

28:37.715 --> 28:40.885
and now you're suddenly
having non-binary sex.

28:40.969 --> 28:43.847
It was the most alive
that I have felt in years.

28:43.930 --> 28:45.890
A finger made
you feel alive?

28:45.974 --> 28:47.642
Everything about them
made me feel alive.

28:47.725 --> 28:49.686
-Them?!
There, there are others?
-No, no, no, no.

28:49.769 --> 28:53.898

as in Che's pronoun.

28:53.982 --> 28:55.984

say one more thing?

28:56.067 --> 28:56.734
