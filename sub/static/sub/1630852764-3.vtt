00:35.827 --> 00:42.208


01:15.283 --> 01:16.659
Whoo!

01:25.085 --> 01:26.336
Bulldogs!

01:28.922 --> 01:29.756
Hi!

01:29.839 --> 01:30.924
We love you guys!

01:34.177 --> 01:35.970
Good going, Bulldogs!

01:39.516 --> 01:40.850
All the way, boys!

01:46.314 --> 01:48.233
-Thank you, Serenity!
-Yeah!

01:48.316 --> 01:50.443
You guys should be so proud of your sons,

01:50.527 --> 01:52.195
brothers, your neighbors.

01:52.278 --> 01:55.448
These young men
had an excellent performance at State.

01:55.532 --> 01:57.534
First time in ten years
we made it this far!

02:00.120 --> 02:02.705
The Bulldogs
are a team filled with strong hearts,

02:02.789 --> 02:04.582
determination, and talent.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.668
Coach Maddox,
from your added vantage point

02:06.751 --> 02:08.461
of a former Major League player,

02:08.545 --> 02:10.630
why were you unable
to take the team all the way?

02:11.506 --> 02:13.758
You can have a lot of talent
and play your heart out,

02:13.842 --> 02:15.760
but sometimes it just doesn't go your way.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.848
Do we wish we'd come in first
instead of fourth?

02:19.931 --> 02:21.808
Sure, but, I mean, this is State.

02:21.891 --> 02:23.810
Our team couldn't have asked
for better leadership

02:23.893 --> 02:26.229
than we got from Coach Cal
and Coach Harlan all season.

02:26.312 --> 02:30.150
And Captain Ty here was amazing too,
every moment of every game.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.944
And we are nothing but proud
of all of y'all.

02:33.027 --> 02:35.572
So, folks, take these boys home
and celebrate 'em!

02:35.655 --> 02:37.448
-Thanks for everything.

02:38.741 --> 02:40.285
Whoo!

02:41.244 --> 02:42.203
Yes!

02:42.912 --> 02:45.623
-Yeah, Bulldogs!
-Proud of you, dude!

02:54.841 --> 02:56.843
Cal, take it down a notch.

02:56.926 --> 02:59.345
No. Those kids played their hearts out,
and I failed them!

03:06.686 --> 03:08.188
Maddie, Ty, um…

03:08.271 --> 03:09.105
You're busy.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.482
It's okay. We'll… we'll talk later.

03:11.566 --> 03:12.442
Come on.

03:14.235 --> 03:15.987
Good work, Ty. Thank you.

03:16.571 --> 03:17.447
Thanks, Coach.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.044
Are you a good guy or a bad guy?

03:31.127 --> 03:34.214
-He's a pirate, Nana.
-No, I'm a gold hoarder.

03:34.297 --> 03:38.259
We're treasure hunters. Our founder died
gathering gold from the ocean floor.

03:38.343 --> 03:39.928
A hero of your own story.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.472
Why can't we play together, Kyle?

03:42.555 --> 03:44.474
Because you don't like
playing <i>Gold Hoarder</i>,

03:44.557 --> 03:46.476
-and I <i>wanna</i> play<i> Gold Hoarder.</i>

03:46.559 --> 03:49.562
Oh! Welcome home,
oh mighty warrior!

03:49.646 --> 03:51.898
You're back!
Mom said you didn't win,

03:51.981 --> 03:53.983
but I bet you would have won
if you could throw.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.109
Pitch.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.362
-I am so proud of you.
-Thanks, Nana.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.616
-Yeah!
-Mom and I picked up Chinese food.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.785
-She's in the kitchen.
-Let's go help her.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.083
-Did you get egg rolls?
-Of course.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.459
Losing sucks.

04:11.542 --> 04:12.710
Yes. Yes, it does.

04:12.794 --> 04:15.546
-Wanna beat up some skeletons?
-Haven't you beat up enough?

04:15.630 --> 04:19.509
Oh, I see. Just in case I wasn't feeling
bad enough about what happened,

04:19.592 --> 04:22.595
you're gonna blame your gang
of Neanderthals losing State on me too?

04:22.679 --> 04:25.056
None of us would be here
if you hadn't lost your mind!

04:25.139 --> 04:26.891
Great. Great, so now I'm crazy too!

04:26.975 --> 04:29.936
All right. When are we gonna talk about
how your huge ego started everything?

04:30.019 --> 04:32.313
You're the one
who had to take on Jackson both times.

04:32.397 --> 04:33.398
I was protecting you!

04:33.481 --> 04:34.691
No, I was protecting you!

04:34.774 --> 04:35.858
Great job.

04:48.746 --> 04:49.622
Hey.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.500
Uh, you got a minute?

04:53.835 --> 04:54.669
Yeah.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.219
Yesterday, at school…

05:05.471 --> 05:07.056
I'm sorry you saw me like that.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.269
Uh…

05:11.352 --> 05:15.064
I've experienced firsthand

05:15.648 --> 05:17.900
what anger can do to a relationship.

05:19.527 --> 05:20.903
I will not go there again.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.196
You don't have to.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.366
I have a temper,

05:26.784 --> 05:29.078
but I work at it, hard.

05:30.246 --> 05:33.458
Once in a while, when I fail,

05:33.541 --> 05:37.086
when I…
…let someone down who matters to me,

05:38.629 --> 05:40.173
it can still get away from me.

05:42.216 --> 05:43.926
I understand.

05:44.635 --> 05:47.930
Believe me, I have breathed fire
with the best of 'em.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.601
But it… it's not just me
that I'm thinking of.

05:52.310 --> 05:55.646
Yeah, Ty has shouldered his fair share
of disappointment and then some.

05:56.856 --> 06:00.526
I owe him an apology also,
but I had to talk to you first.

06:03.946 --> 06:05.990
When I couldn't play anymore…

06:09.243 --> 06:14.999
I knew I had to find constructive ways
to express what was inside,

06:15.083 --> 06:17.460
or the anger would eat me alive.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.798
It's been working.

06:21.881 --> 06:22.799
I just

06:24.217 --> 06:25.176
lost my footing.

06:26.594 --> 06:27.428
I'm sorry.

06:28.679 --> 06:29.514
Thank you.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.267
Don't shut me out.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.187
Don't shut down on me. Just--

06:36.270 --> 06:37.480
I'll stay on it.

06:38.398 --> 06:40.733
Would it be okay
if I came by and talked to Ty?

06:40.817 --> 06:41.651
Sure.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.654
But not tonight. I, um…

06:44.737 --> 06:49.283
I have to attend
some mysterious public hearing.

06:54.288 --> 06:57.875
I told Neville we'd narrow down
the candidates to the top three.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.586
I just wanna say, um,

07:00.670 --> 07:03.714
I think finding someone
with a compatible philosophy

07:03.798 --> 07:06.884
is an important aspect
of choosing an agribusiness manager.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.471
Well, I wasn't clear on his philosophy,

07:10.555 --> 07:12.640
but the guy from Virginia Tech,

07:13.141 --> 07:16.644
he didn't have much of a plan
to increase output on the produce

07:16.727 --> 07:18.855
that I need most, especially in late fall.

07:18.938 --> 07:22.984
Well, he did… he did know
his numbers, though, don't you think?

07:23.067 --> 07:25.695
Take a look at Marybeth.
She seemed collaborative.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.322
And her thoughts on crop rotation
are wonderfully progressive.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.323
Soybeans?

07:29.407 --> 07:33.411
Name me one traditional Southern dish
that I can make with soybeans.

07:33.494 --> 07:35.580
I had southern-fried soy curls once.

07:35.663 --> 07:36.622
-Ew!
-Delicious!

07:36.706 --> 07:39.041
You could expand
the vegan offerings on your menu.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.668
You two discuss. Excuse me.

07:40.751 --> 07:42.420
Ew. Let me tell you something.

07:42.503 --> 07:47.008
You should know
that I like to be swept off my feet.

07:47.091 --> 07:50.344
So I would like to see other candidates.

07:50.428 --> 07:53.389
If you're gonna be this tough to please,
I can only think of one way forward.

07:54.640 --> 08:00.271
We need to have dinner Thursday night
to go over everything in detail.

08:00.354 --> 08:01.314
Sign me up.

08:02.523 --> 08:06.319
Who sends out a public hearing notice
with so little notice?

08:09.363 --> 08:11.282
"Serenity Town Council…" Hmm.

08:11.365 --> 08:17.205
"…invites stakeholders to discuss
infrastructure and renewal proposals."

08:17.288 --> 08:19.540
Well, that doesn't sound
too terribly descriptive.

08:19.624 --> 08:22.919
They could be building bomb shelters
under Wharton's for all I can decipher.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.296
I'll attend for you
and find out what it's actually about.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.089
No, you have been working overtime.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.884
I will go, and I will see
if it's anything that will affect us.

08:29.967 --> 08:33.429
If you're going there,
is there anything I can do here

08:33.513 --> 08:35.348
or anywhere else to help you?

08:37.517 --> 08:39.435
You seem a bit buried, boss.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.772
And excuse me for saying so,
it's not your best look.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.399
I thought all the stress
would bring out the color in my cheeks.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.984
Well, call me old-fashioned,

08:47.068 --> 08:50.613
but how about we remove
some of that stress and go back to blush?

08:50.696 --> 08:53.032
Talking to you is a great first step.

08:55.576 --> 08:56.702
I need a therapist.

08:56.786 --> 08:59.038
Hold on, I didn't mean to suggest--

08:59.121 --> 09:00.081
Not for me.

09:00.831 --> 09:01.707
For Kyle.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.835
He won't talk to me,
so he has to talk to a professional.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.255
-Yeah.
-I just…

09:07.338 --> 09:10.716
I don't know. It seems like bad manners
going around asking for recommendations.

09:11.592 --> 09:15.012
"Hello, lovely day. Do you go to therapy?
Do you like your therapist?"

09:15.096 --> 09:17.390
-I love my therapist.
-See, I didn't mean to pry.

09:17.473 --> 09:19.267
Not one I have appointments with.

09:20.643 --> 09:21.978
The one I'm married to.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.855
Ashley. Oh, of course!

09:24.939 --> 09:27.066
Wait, does he see teenagers?
Would he see Kyle?

09:27.149 --> 09:28.067
Hang on.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.405
Hey, Ash.

09:32.488 --> 09:35.741
I know we were
supposed to have lunch today,

09:35.825 --> 09:38.995
but how about we reschedule?

09:47.461 --> 09:50.131
Helen, good to see you here--
Helen, what's wrong?

09:51.007 --> 09:52.216
Want me to get Dana Sue?

09:55.761 --> 09:58.097
Take me to the hospital, please.

09:58.180 --> 09:59.015
All right.

09:59.682 --> 10:00.766
I got you. I got you.

10:21.412 --> 10:22.622
Okra!

10:22.705 --> 10:24.081
Mmm.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.333
Yes, yes, yes!

10:25.416 --> 10:29.045
And cucumbers. I hope there's parsley
in here too, you know?

10:29.128 --> 10:30.963
-My parsley…
-Mm-hmm.

10:31.047 --> 10:33.424
…and cucumber salad

10:33.507 --> 10:35.593
with white wine vinaigrette,

10:36.427 --> 10:38.471
you know, is a top request all summer.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.807
-Would I deny you anything you need?

10:49.732 --> 10:52.276
You know, if you keep being
this much fun to work with,

10:52.360 --> 10:55.071
I think we'll be able
to figure out everything.

10:56.989 --> 11:01.869
Hey! Hate to interrupt
whatever business is happening here,

11:01.952 --> 11:04.497
but… I think we met.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.291
-Ronnie Sullivan. Annie's Dad.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.293
I remember. Uh, Jeremy Reynolds.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.544
Guy with the plums.

11:10.628 --> 11:15.007
Jeremy is running Benji Hayes' co-op.
We're getting back into business with him.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.010
Oh, that's great news.
Congratulations, man.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.096
And, as I'm sure you already know,

11:20.179 --> 11:23.015
you couldn't be going into business
with a smarter woman.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.434
Or a busier one.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.938
So, busy lady, am I next on the agenda?

11:29.021 --> 11:30.940
Why don't you wait out at the bar?

11:32.942 --> 11:35.277
I'mma go wait at the bar.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.534
-I'm sorry about that.

11:41.617 --> 11:44.870
Timing is not his strong suit. So…

11:44.954 --> 11:48.416
Did I misunderstand
where things stand with the two of you?

11:49.083 --> 11:50.751
No, it is over.

11:52.837 --> 11:53.921
Does he know that?

12:16.444 --> 12:18.028
Must you hang out in my room?

12:18.112 --> 12:19.572
It's not your room.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.200
Trust me, I'd rather be celebrating
the start of my summer vacation

12:23.284 --> 12:26.412
by playing baseball or doing
pretty much anything else in the world

12:26.495 --> 12:27.872
than sitting here with you.

12:27.955 --> 12:31.292
Imagine how excited I am to listen to you
mourn baseball all summer.

12:32.001 --> 12:35.629
Hey, here's a thought. Um, go take a walk!
Because, you know, you can.

12:36.297 --> 12:39.133
I wanna sign your cast again, Ty.
In a different color.

12:39.216 --> 12:41.719
And I'm gonna do a whole mural on Kyle's,

12:41.802 --> 12:45.806
starting with a Parasaurolophus
tilted up to reach a really high branch.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.516
Doesn't anyone care what I want?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.477
Could you stop with all the attitude?

12:49.560 --> 12:50.811
I don't know, Ty. Can I?

12:51.854 --> 12:53.063
Maybe I'm crazy.

12:53.147 --> 12:56.776
Apparently, Mom thinks I'm crazy.
Does everybody think I'm crazy?

12:56.859 --> 12:58.027
I don't, Kyle.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.653
You're just grumpy.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.990
-How about purple?
-That's fine, Katie.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.784
Just your name. No flowers or hearts.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.163
Mom's worried about you,
and, honestly, I get why.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.707
Guess that's why
Dr. Ashley's coming to see me.

13:12.666 --> 13:14.043
Trotter's husband Dr. Ashley?

13:14.126 --> 13:16.378
Dr. "I'm a therapist" Ashley?

13:17.004 --> 13:17.838
Yeah.

13:20.841 --> 13:21.926
Like he could fix me.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.137
Kyle, what color for you?

13:25.221 --> 13:26.347
Does it matter?

13:28.098 --> 13:30.810
Hey, Katie, let's go sign my cast
in your room, okay?

13:30.893 --> 13:32.645
Let's give Jimmy Stewart his space.

13:32.728 --> 13:33.938
-Who?
-Come on.

13:37.566 --> 13:39.443
-Sure you wanna go with purple?
-Yes.

13:40.236 --> 13:44.281
Hey, I'm… I'm sorry, but, you know,
you asked me to come by, so--

13:44.365 --> 13:45.199
I have news.

13:45.908 --> 13:46.826
Farmer?

13:47.326 --> 13:49.328
I no longer need your help
with the restaurant.

13:49.411 --> 13:50.788
I have a new investor.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.165
Farmer?

13:53.249 --> 13:54.917
Cal Maddox.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.001
What, the shortstop?

13:57.419 --> 14:00.464
Oh, okay. Um, no, I… I mean, I get it.

14:00.548 --> 14:04.093
A… a Major League Baseball player's
in a better position

14:04.176 --> 14:08.305
to help you with Sullivan's,
but I hope you know I was

14:08.389 --> 14:12.685
and am ready to do whatever it takes.

14:12.768 --> 14:14.395
Yeah, I appreciate it.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.276
Well, guess we're still partners
where it counts.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.696
-Excuse me?
-Raising our daughter?

14:24.488 --> 14:25.573
Yeah, true enough.

14:26.782 --> 14:29.243
Annie sure is happy to have you here.

14:29.326 --> 14:30.870
Not as happy as I am.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.747
So, hey, how about
we honor that great tradition

14:33.831 --> 14:36.834
of opening day
at Serenity Summer Market, huh?

14:36.917 --> 14:38.002
Huh? You know?

14:38.085 --> 14:40.129
Three of us together, like the old days.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.090
What?

14:43.173 --> 14:47.845
Do you remember that summer
that Annie was… …seven,

14:47.928 --> 14:50.389
and she got sick on the way home
because we let her have…

14:50.472 --> 14:53.225
…cotton candy for breakfast?

14:53.309 --> 14:55.686
Not our finest parenting.

14:55.769 --> 14:58.022
Well, I'm, uh, sure she forgives us.

14:58.105 --> 15:00.858
-Yeah.
-I also bet she'd like to go.

15:01.358 --> 15:04.194
-Promise I'll be the disciplinarian.
-No.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.071
-Just this once.
-Uh-huh, really?

15:06.155 --> 15:08.282
Yeah, and I will tell her

15:08.824 --> 15:11.619
that she has to have
something sensible for breakfast, like

15:12.369 --> 15:13.203
funnel cake.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.499
Kyle? Ashley's here.

15:18.375 --> 15:19.293
Yes, ma'am.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.963
-Good to see you, Kyle.
-Sir.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.926
Can I get you anything? Water, coffee?

15:27.009 --> 15:29.053
-No, I think we'll be fine.
-Okay.

15:29.136 --> 15:31.305
Enjoy your 50 minutes off.

15:31.972 --> 15:34.058
Right, of course. Of course.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.852
Okay, well, you two enjoy your appointment

15:36.936 --> 15:38.646
or your talk,

15:39.563 --> 15:40.898
visit, whatever.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.900
-I will just, um…

15:45.611 --> 15:46.528
I have to go.

15:47.488 --> 15:51.075
Honey, Nana's in the backyard with Katie.
If you need anything, holler, okay?

15:51.158 --> 15:53.118
-It was good to see you.
-Good seeing you.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.458
Sorry about your leg.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.253
How's it coming along?

16:05.547 --> 16:09.301
-If I tell you I'm fine, what happens?
-What would you like to have happen?

16:20.062 --> 16:21.063
Don't rush.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.798
I took the liberty of calling them.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.425
It's not a time to be alone.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.971
-Here.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.100
We're here.

16:58.183 --> 17:02.229
-I lost the baby. I lost my baby.
-I know.

17:02.312 --> 17:04.314
I lost my baby!

17:41.435 --> 17:42.436
-Whoo!

17:47.107 --> 17:47.983
Hey, Coach.

17:48.067 --> 17:50.402
Thought I'd come by early
and help you set up.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.404
Well, while I admire your commitment,

17:53.822 --> 17:56.825
what are you doing here, man?
This week's batting, and you…

17:58.327 --> 18:01.163
What am I supposed to do
if I don't have baseball camp?

18:02.372 --> 18:04.583
Hey, you gotta be patient, Ty.

18:06.168 --> 18:09.755
How about this? The next few weeks,
work on your core and flexibility.

18:09.838 --> 18:14.051
After we get the all clear from Dr. Ahmed,
we'll move to the next phase of training.

18:16.678 --> 18:19.056
Now go! Dude, it's summer, relax.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.433
Go have fun with your friends.
Hang with your girlfriend.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.269
Yeah, 'cause I'm such a fun boyfriend
right now.

18:27.689 --> 18:29.525
Okay, what's really going on?

18:34.238 --> 18:36.031
-It's my fault I got hurt.
-No.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.575
-So it's my fault we lost State.
-Absolute no.

18:38.659 --> 18:42.079
That is my blame you're talking about.
You're the captain, but I'm the coach.

18:42.162 --> 18:43.789
Yeah, you're a great coach.

18:43.872 --> 18:45.707
I appreciate that, but listen to me.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.378
A win is not just one player,
and neither is a loss.

18:50.963 --> 18:55.050
I mean, would I have loved
to have you on the mound? Absolutely.

18:55.551 --> 19:00.430
But you stepped up as a leader,
and that… that's what counts.

19:03.058 --> 19:05.227
Mental rehab is also important.

19:06.270 --> 19:08.313
You gotta learn to process things
the right way.

19:08.397 --> 19:12.067
You saw that I didn't handle
the loss of State well.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.698
So maybe the two of us
can help each other get through.

19:18.991 --> 19:22.119
You know, talk things out
before they get too deep.

19:23.745 --> 19:24.580
Yeah.

19:26.456 --> 19:27.624
Yeah, that sounds good.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.501
All right.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.174
-Not staying?
-Uh, no.

19:37.593 --> 19:39.553
Not answering any text messages either.

19:40.387 --> 19:41.805
Just don't have much to say.

19:41.889 --> 19:45.726
I get that, but the occasional meme
as proof of life, dude,

19:46.518 --> 19:47.644
that's all I'm asking.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.273
-Yeah.
-You good, Ty?

19:54.026 --> 19:54.985
Yeah, gonna be.

19:57.321 --> 19:58.322
All right, see you.

20:04.578 --> 20:07.748
That is the smell of a well-run kitchen!

20:07.831 --> 20:09.917
Thank you, Erik. Thank all y'all

20:10.000 --> 20:13.670
for keeping things humming
while I tended to some personal business.

20:13.754 --> 20:15.047
So thank you.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.340
Here's the order, Chef.

20:16.423 --> 20:17.799
Yes, thank you.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.636
Now, I added a spinach quiche.
For the iron.

20:21.511 --> 20:22.346
Thanks.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.306
Erik, can I…

20:31.230 --> 20:32.147
Um…

20:33.732 --> 20:35.025
How's Helen coming along?

20:35.651 --> 20:37.778
Uh, she is quiet.

20:38.862 --> 20:41.156
Which, you know, is to be expected.

20:41.990 --> 20:45.035
Uh, but we all owe you
a… a debt of thanks.

20:45.118 --> 20:46.828
Not at all. Glad to be of help.

20:46.912 --> 20:51.208
Yeah. Is something going on
with you two that I should know about?

20:51.291 --> 20:52.459
Why would you think that?

20:52.542 --> 20:54.461
I… I mean, I'm just saying that,

20:55.337 --> 20:59.091
you know, you'd expect her
to… to call in a close friend

20:59.758 --> 21:01.134
in a situation like this.

21:01.218 --> 21:05.889
Well, I'm just a friend who was,
you know, close at the moment.

21:07.391 --> 21:10.310
Now, it's gonna get cold
if we stand here jawing too much longer.

21:10.394 --> 21:11.228
Yes.

21:15.732 --> 21:17.276
Are you here for dinner?

21:17.359 --> 21:21.822
In appreciation for all the great photos
you've taken for the team all season,

21:21.905 --> 21:24.783
it is my pleasure to present you
with this humble offering

21:24.866 --> 21:26.159
from all the Bulldogs.

21:34.751 --> 21:38.213
-Uh… Yeah.
-Oh.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.423
Thank you.

21:39.506 --> 21:40.424
You're welcome.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.265
Let this hearing come to order.

21:48.348 --> 21:51.685
Thank you all for coming.
Happy to see such a full turnout.

21:51.768 --> 21:54.730
Serenity is always evolving,
and let me just say,

21:54.813 --> 21:58.734
it is my pleasure and my honor
to serve such an expansive community.

21:58.817 --> 22:01.778
Isn't it a little early
to launch his reelection campaign?

22:02.779 --> 22:04.698
…in the awkward position
of uneven growth.

22:04.781 --> 22:07.743
Certain, shall we say,
specialty businesses

22:07.826 --> 22:10.162
are creating infrastructure issues

22:10.245 --> 22:14.249
at a point where our town revenue
cannot take on that burden unaided.

22:14.333 --> 22:19.004
I'd like to begin by recognizing
Petey Martin from Building and Safety.

22:19.087 --> 22:20.047
Good evening.

22:20.839 --> 22:25.093
We've received numerous complaints
about new boutique businesses

22:25.177 --> 22:28.388
who are more concerned
with image than impact.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.017
They're causing problems
with parking and traffic.

22:32.851 --> 22:35.562
We've been forced
to implement parking restrictions

22:35.645 --> 22:38.148
until these businesses are able to address

22:38.231 --> 22:40.442
the problems
they're causing their neighbors.

22:40.525 --> 22:41.568
You too?

22:41.651 --> 22:43.403
I could come wallpaper your foyer

22:43.487 --> 22:45.781
with all the parking tickets
my work trucks have gotten

22:45.864 --> 22:46.948
these past two weeks.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.910
-He's not done, Maddie, Skeeter.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.204
We'll wait, Trent.

22:52.287 --> 22:53.121
Petey.

22:56.416 --> 22:59.378
Increased traffic in residential areas

22:59.461 --> 23:02.672
has gotten to the point
where residents are often unable to park

23:02.756 --> 23:04.383
in front of their own homes.

23:04.466 --> 23:07.094
We propose that to alleviate the hardship,

23:07.177 --> 23:11.681
business owners have 21 days to submit
a plan to mitigate the parking problem,

23:12.391 --> 23:15.477
or council will be compelled
to take action.

23:16.978 --> 23:20.399
Is there anyone present
who wishes to address the council?

23:24.152 --> 23:26.154
Chair recognizes Maddie Townsend.

23:26.863 --> 23:29.408
As you know quite well, Mr. Mayor,

23:29.491 --> 23:35.372
I'm here responding as an owner of one
of these specialty boutique businesses.

23:36.248 --> 23:40.210
Our clients have already gotten
numerous parking tickets

23:40.293 --> 23:41.503
with no explanation.

23:42.462 --> 23:45.465
Why were we not contacted
before this plan was set in motion

23:45.549 --> 23:47.717
so we could propose a solution?

23:47.801 --> 23:51.346
Mrs. Townsend, how could we expect you
to present a solution

23:51.430 --> 23:53.598
before we've even explained the problem?

23:54.141 --> 23:55.225
Peggy Martin.

23:56.726 --> 24:00.355
As a resident in the area
adjacent to the Corner Spa,

24:00.439 --> 24:04.234
I'd like to propose
that instituting time limits for parking

24:04.317 --> 24:08.405
on the smaller side streets
would also discourage spa patrons

24:08.488 --> 24:11.032
from parking
in front of our houses all day long.

24:11.658 --> 24:15.495
Mrs. Townsend, would you like to respond
to that suggestion?

24:16.079 --> 24:17.205
Bless your hearts.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.959
I will respond, within 21 days.

24:24.254 --> 24:25.964
Chair would like to recognize
Skeeter Ramsey.

24:33.388 --> 24:36.141
I'm not much happier
than Maddie is, Mr. Mayor.

24:36.224 --> 24:38.351
Is this a typical council meeting?

24:39.102 --> 24:43.690
No. They all can be pretty strange
and petty.

24:44.191 --> 24:48.069
But, I don't know, something about this
stinks like week-old fish,

24:48.153 --> 24:49.529
and I'm gonna find out what.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.823
And I'm not particularly interested

24:51.907 --> 24:55.744
in collecting the dozens of tickets
I know I'll get

24:55.827 --> 24:59.039
when I'm parked in front of your house
for the week it takes to

25:00.290 --> 25:01.917
redo your wife's powder room.

25:03.084 --> 25:05.504
Do I stay home,
and you deal with her?

25:06.004 --> 25:07.881
Or do we deal with this?

25:26.650 --> 25:27.526
Hey, honey.

25:29.277 --> 25:30.153
How you doing?

25:30.737 --> 25:32.239
Sorry I've been gone all day.

25:33.490 --> 25:34.491
People needed you.

25:35.992 --> 25:38.745
Well, Aunt Helen's doing much better,
thank the Lord.

25:40.413 --> 25:41.790
How was your time with Ashley?

25:44.960 --> 25:47.546
Well, we, um, didn't solve world hunger,

25:47.629 --> 25:50.048
but we made some real progress
on climate change.

25:51.550 --> 25:55.262
It's good to see you're making a joke.
I'm here if you wanna talk.

25:56.471 --> 25:58.723
Ashley said
I don't have to tell you anything.

25:59.307 --> 26:00.392
It's confidential.

26:02.143 --> 26:02.978
Okay.

26:05.146 --> 26:06.356
Don't stay up too late.

26:07.691 --> 26:08.900
Should we wake Nana?

26:12.946 --> 26:14.656
Nah. Just let her sleep.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.204
Night, baby.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.029
Breakfast of champions!

26:54.112 --> 26:56.656
-I cannot believe we caved.

26:56.740 --> 26:59.200
-Oh, you want some?
-Uh, no!

26:59.284 --> 27:01.536
That didn't mean
you had to eat the whole thing yourself.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.871
-It's true.

27:07.167 --> 27:10.587
I thought, uh,
we could all match for the day.

27:10.670 --> 27:12.631
Mmm, so we don't get lost in the crowd?

27:12.714 --> 27:15.467
I'm thinking more like a… a family crest.

27:15.550 --> 27:18.845
-At least it's not a real tattoo.
-I can't have one of those until I'm--

27:18.928 --> 27:20.388
-Twenty-one.
-Eighteen.

27:20.472 --> 27:21.514
Twenty-one.

27:21.598 --> 27:23.141
-I like Daddy's answer.

27:23.224 --> 27:25.268
Yeah, surprise, surprise.

27:25.352 --> 27:27.020
-Oh my!
-Oh wow!

27:27.103 --> 27:28.813
Very nice for the day.

27:28.897 --> 27:31.775
All right, Mommy next. Wanna help me out?

27:31.858 --> 27:32.692
All right.

27:32.776 --> 27:34.361
-Okay.
-I promise.

27:34.444 --> 27:35.695
-Maybe I do.

27:38.698 --> 27:40.742
-I don't trust you.
-All right. Here we go.

27:40.825 --> 27:42.327
-Okay, you live.
-Gonna walk.

27:42.410 --> 27:44.579
-You put the same one on?
-You guys have fun.

27:44.663 --> 27:46.289
-Truth.
-Oh!

27:46.373 --> 27:49.209
-I'll catch you later.
-That is not that bad.

27:49.292 --> 27:50.752
-All right.
-Do me.

27:52.003 --> 27:52.962
Mm-hmm.

27:53.046 --> 27:53.922
All right.

27:56.091 --> 28:00.345
Thank you for filling that out.
That's for you. We really appreciate it.

28:01.721 --> 28:03.765
Never mind,
you're selling something.

28:03.848 --> 28:04.974
Oh, don't go!

28:05.058 --> 28:06.434
You could be missing out

28:06.518 --> 28:09.062
on the best real estate opportunities
in Serenity!

28:09.145 --> 28:10.772
Your mom puts you to work too?

28:10.855 --> 28:15.402
I can't leave until all of these are gone.
I'm supposed to be nice while I do it too.

28:15.485 --> 28:16.778
Oh, I wanna see that.

28:16.861 --> 28:20.156
I ran out of the bright pink pens,
or I'd stab myself with one!

28:22.492 --> 28:23.451
Gimme half.

28:23.535 --> 28:27.163
It'll ease the pain
of my parents humiliating me in public.

28:27.247 --> 28:28.540
You remember that one time…

28:28.623 --> 28:29.874
Let's take the far side.

28:31.626 --> 28:33.211
Wow, yeah, thank you.

28:35.213 --> 28:38.800
Hey, when we're done, how about
I treat you to some cotton candy?

28:38.883 --> 28:40.552
Oh, I already had breakfast.

28:40.635 --> 28:41.594
Breakfast?

28:45.932 --> 28:46.891
I'll be right back.

28:47.642 --> 28:50.812
Ronnie, good to see you.
How long you in town?

28:50.895 --> 28:52.564
Well, as long as it takes.

28:52.647 --> 28:54.774
Mm. Let me know. Could be newsworthy.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.025
Keep you posted, Peggy.

28:58.945 --> 29:00.071
Wait a minute!

29:00.697 --> 29:02.866
-Wait, he's gone!
-Who?

29:02.949 --> 29:07.078
Oh, he's probably 800 years old by now.
He made those lotions and those lip balms.

29:07.162 --> 29:09.748
His booth was always
right next to <i>The Sentinel.</i>

29:09.831 --> 29:12.417
Oh, yes, I do remember

29:12.500 --> 29:16.838
'cause it was…
it was like kissing a ripe fruit. Mm.

29:18.089 --> 29:21.634
I think we lost Annie. Let's find Annie.

29:21.718 --> 29:24.304
Well, she's, uh…

29:24.971 --> 29:27.766
…over there talking to the Lewis boy, see?

29:27.849 --> 29:30.393
Oh. I may need
to have a talk with her.

29:30.477 --> 29:33.313
She reminds me
a little too much of me at that age.

29:34.689 --> 29:35.899
Nothing wrong with that.

29:37.275 --> 29:38.943
Hey, Annie's dad!

29:41.154 --> 29:43.615
-Hey, farmer!
-Come on over.

29:43.698 --> 29:47.118
-I've got something you may like.
-I already got what I like, thanks.

29:47.202 --> 29:50.497
Well, your stuff might be out of date.
See, this is fresh jam.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.373
Nothing comes close to my jam.

29:52.457 --> 29:56.169
I'll pass. Unless, of course,
you got something with a bite to it?

29:56.711 --> 29:58.463
-All right, Ronnie?

29:58.546 --> 30:00.465
We need to move on. Let's go.

30:00.548 --> 30:02.550
-Dana Sue--
-Jeremy, I'll call you later.

30:02.634 --> 30:04.469
Good luck with jam endeavors.

30:05.553 --> 30:07.180
Goats are cute.

30:15.271 --> 30:17.857
Dracula emerges from his crypt!

30:17.941 --> 30:19.067
Hey, I missed you too.

30:19.776 --> 30:21.611
I… I thought you weren't coming out.

30:21.694 --> 30:24.239
-Uh, I thought you weren't free today.
-You call this free?

30:24.322 --> 30:25.740
Pancakes! Pancakes!

30:25.824 --> 30:28.910
Okay, Joshua should be
at the head of the line by now. Go see.

30:29.410 --> 30:31.996
Wow, all three of them.
You really have your hands full.

30:32.080 --> 30:34.833
Yeah, which is why I've been trying
to get a hold of you to make a plan.

30:35.583 --> 30:40.296
Look, I know your summer's derailed,
but mine's been laid out since March.

30:41.172 --> 30:42.549
What, with my mom on the road,

30:42.632 --> 30:45.468
my dad working extra shifts,
and me looking after these three

30:45.552 --> 30:46.970
and working for Miss Helen…

30:49.389 --> 30:51.307
Uh, how are things shaping up for you?

30:51.391 --> 30:54.853
No baseball camp, so I'll help out
at the spa as much as I can.

30:55.603 --> 30:58.648
And why does it take three days
for you to answer a text?

31:03.903 --> 31:06.573
I wasn't thinking
about how much pain you're in.

31:07.156 --> 31:08.283
They give you something?

31:08.366 --> 31:10.243
Yeah. Yeah, it's just, uh…

31:16.040 --> 31:17.250
Do you wanna get together?

31:19.127 --> 31:21.588
It's kinda why
I've been texting you nonstop.

31:22.839 --> 31:25.842
Look, my schedule is tight,
but let's figure something out, okay?

31:25.925 --> 31:26.759
Right.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.014
I got extra strawberries!

31:31.097 --> 31:34.517
One of my strawberries fell off!

31:35.852 --> 31:39.355
Okay, really, over strawberries?
Where's my change, and where's Joshua?

31:40.565 --> 31:41.482
Okay.

31:41.983 --> 31:44.527
Text me, and don't wait three days.

31:44.611 --> 31:45.445
You got it.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.364
Come on, okay. Did you see him?

31:48.448 --> 31:49.449
Yeah.

31:54.454 --> 31:55.413
Mm.

31:56.956 --> 31:57.790
Mm.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.084
This is bliss.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.129
Dana Sue was right
about you and those pancakes.

32:03.212 --> 32:04.047
Mm.

32:04.130 --> 32:05.381
I have to get Beau's recipe.

32:05.465 --> 32:07.425
He won't give it to you.

32:07.508 --> 32:09.928
And even if he does,
don't trust the ingredients.

32:10.428 --> 32:12.347
He won't admit
that there's magic involved.

32:16.059 --> 32:17.435
It's good to see you smile.

32:19.896 --> 32:21.689
-Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.902
I do feel better today.

32:26.986 --> 32:30.406
Even thought about going down
to the market myself to get these, but…

32:32.659 --> 32:34.035
thanks for delivering.

32:37.455 --> 32:40.041
You know, I applaud your decision
to rest a bit longer.

32:41.209 --> 32:44.963
Even strong people need to give
their friends a chance to pamper them.

32:45.046 --> 32:46.923
Well, thanks to the Lord
for those friends.

32:49.550 --> 32:52.470
I did talk my boss into giving me
the whole day off though.

32:53.054 --> 32:55.765
-I've heard she can be tough.
-No sh--

32:57.558 --> 32:59.268
So I'm glad she listened.

32:59.352 --> 33:03.898
People put too much emphasis
into jumping back into the fray.

33:03.982 --> 33:05.733
You know, pushing past pain

33:05.817 --> 33:08.361
usually means not dealing with it.

33:12.949 --> 33:14.534
Just take the time it takes.

33:21.874 --> 33:23.376
Yep, and I have to try that.

33:27.714 --> 33:28.715
You're not kidding.

33:28.798 --> 33:29.799
I told you.

33:31.551 --> 33:32.760
-Magic!
-They're magical.

33:39.517 --> 33:43.688
Do you suppose there's a special degree
in incomprehensible vocabulary

33:43.771 --> 33:46.065
you have to earn
to work in municipal government?

33:46.149 --> 33:48.484
They want you
to throw up your hands and walk away,

33:48.568 --> 33:51.154
which is why we're gonna fight back.

33:51.237 --> 33:53.531
-Thanks for being on the team.
-You say that now.

33:53.614 --> 33:56.451
But if we're gonna fight zoning,
there's a bigger battle to wage.

33:56.534 --> 33:57.827
How so?

33:58.619 --> 34:00.705
The Corner Spa
should have a childcare center.

34:01.873 --> 34:02.707
Oh?

34:03.458 --> 34:06.044
Oh. Well, that's an intriguing idea.

34:06.127 --> 34:09.756
We'd capture more moms who are hesitant
to hire a sitter to come work out.

34:09.839 --> 34:12.341
They'd come more often, stay longer.

34:12.842 --> 34:14.510
I could even teach kiddie yoga.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.554
This is brilliant, Trotter.

34:16.637 --> 34:18.681
Well, no, it's selfish.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.476
I want the childcare ready
for when I need it.

34:22.810 --> 34:23.644
Trotter?

34:24.228 --> 34:26.814
-Trotter!

34:26.898 --> 34:28.191
I mean, no baby yet,

34:28.274 --> 34:31.903
but we're starting to work with Helen,
and why not move forward in hope?

34:31.986 --> 34:33.488
Amen.

34:33.571 --> 34:37.075
And you let me know what you need.
Time off for interviews, whatever.

34:37.575 --> 34:39.327
You have my prayers without asking.

34:39.827 --> 34:43.414
Part of the reason we feel ready
to take the next step is because of you

34:43.498 --> 34:45.333
and Helen and Dana Sue.

34:45.416 --> 34:49.087
We want our child
to grow up surrounded by loving people.

34:51.005 --> 34:52.048
We, uh…

34:53.466 --> 34:57.261
we, uh…
…didn't always have that ourselves.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.013
Well, you do now.

34:59.889 --> 35:04.936
Oh, this lucky, blessed,
beautiful little soul, wherever it may be.

35:06.854 --> 35:07.855
Oh, Trotter!

35:17.073 --> 35:18.157
I got this.

35:18.241 --> 35:20.076
Oh, I know. Just thought

35:21.327 --> 35:22.954
we could talk a little.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.999
Mom, I don't really want a tattoo
other than this one.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.876
Good.

35:29.794 --> 35:32.630
I'm so glad
we got to go to the market together.

35:32.713 --> 35:33.548
It was great.

35:34.173 --> 35:36.843
I mean, makes it official. Summer is here.

35:36.926 --> 35:39.262
Yeah! We haven't even discussed
summer yet.

35:39.345 --> 35:42.974
Are you and Simon
gonna do something special?

35:44.100 --> 35:45.143
Why would we?

35:45.726 --> 35:46.811
We're just friends.

35:46.894 --> 35:49.981
Besides, he already left for a job
with his uncle in Washington, D.C.

35:50.064 --> 35:52.358
Oh. I… I didn't realize.

35:54.193 --> 35:58.698
Well, it sure seems
Jackson's been coming around a lot.

36:00.324 --> 36:01.617
You know, honey,

36:02.827 --> 36:05.204
it's okay to be your own woman.

36:06.205 --> 36:07.957
Right. And?

36:09.333 --> 36:13.880
And you never… you never have to define
yourself by a man.

36:13.963 --> 36:17.592
So you don't have to rush
from Simon to Jackson.

36:18.384 --> 36:19.802
-Seriously?
-Yes!

36:20.303 --> 36:23.389
Mom, I was helping him pass out leaflets.
That's all.

36:23.472 --> 36:24.307
Okay.

36:24.390 --> 36:26.809
Just because you're confused
about the men in your life

36:26.893 --> 36:29.145
does not mean I'm confused
about the guys in mine.

36:43.284 --> 36:44.452
Pour it out.

36:49.832 --> 36:50.708
I, um…

36:52.543 --> 36:55.546
I cannot imagine going through this…

36:57.548 --> 36:59.217
…without having this.

36:59.300 --> 37:02.887
You never have to go through anything,
big or small, on your own.

37:02.970 --> 37:04.972
Erik thought
you might feel a little slighted

37:05.056 --> 37:07.266
because I asked him
to take me to the hospital.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.644
I thought we weren't gonna
talk about that tonight.

37:09.727 --> 37:12.980
I know, but he appeared, just appeared.

37:14.857 --> 37:16.067
Like an angel on my path.

37:16.150 --> 37:18.986
No, we don't have any complaints
about sharing you.

37:19.070 --> 37:23.908
Just taking note
of whom we are sharing you with.

37:23.991 --> 37:24.825
Okay.

37:25.576 --> 37:28.913
Well, then I have something
really important to tell you!

37:28.996 --> 37:31.290
-Oh my. All right. Hold on.
-Wait. Hold on. Let me get…

37:31.374 --> 37:33.292
-Let me just…
-I gotta…

37:33.376 --> 37:34.961
-Just move it. Okay.
-Put that right here.

37:35.044 --> 37:36.212
-Okay.
-Let's get ready.

37:37.421 --> 37:40.758
I need to know what happened
at the hearing the other night.

37:40.841 --> 37:42.426
We can talk about that later.

37:43.719 --> 37:47.807
Petey and Trent seem to think
it's about traffic flow, as does Peggy!

37:47.890 --> 37:49.976
But parking should have been brought up

37:50.059 --> 37:53.145
when Petey signed off
on our certificate of occupancy.

37:53.229 --> 37:55.273
-Mm-hmm.
-I wonder why it wasn't.

37:55.356 --> 37:59.777
Somebody changed their mind,
and we have to find out why.

38:00.945 --> 38:03.948
Maddie, I'll be back on my feet
in no time.

38:04.031 --> 38:05.950
I really don't want you
to get overwhelmed.

38:06.033 --> 38:08.327
No, I'm fine. I'm just whelmed.

38:08.411 --> 38:11.038
-Besides, I think this is personal.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.498
Okay, all right.

38:12.581 --> 38:14.792
Hey, how are your sweet boys?

38:16.002 --> 38:17.962
-Step by step.
-Yeah?

38:18.045 --> 38:21.257
And Annie?
How's her summer starting off, Dana Sue?

38:21.340 --> 38:23.217
This is your superpower, isn't it, Helen?

38:23.301 --> 38:24.135
What is?

38:24.218 --> 38:27.430
Not letting us fuss
when you most need to be fussed over!

38:27.513 --> 38:30.308
You keep steering us east,
little by little,

38:30.391 --> 38:33.311
and we are out in deep water
before we even know we're wet.

38:33.394 --> 38:36.564
I feel better worrying
about you and yours than about myself.

38:37.273 --> 38:41.360
It's like my mama used to tell me.
If we all worry about the people we love,

38:41.444 --> 38:44.905
then we'll always have people
worrying about us,

38:44.989 --> 38:47.366
and then we don't have to worry
about ourselves.

38:48.284 --> 38:50.870
-Amen to that.
-Mm.

38:50.953 --> 38:53.664
Well, Helen,
you want something to worry about?

38:53.748 --> 38:54.582
Yes!

38:54.665 --> 38:58.794
Okay, well, I heard
Ronnie Sullivan and Jeremy Reynolds

38:58.878 --> 39:01.547
were bumping horns like two rhinos
at the Summer Market.

39:01.630 --> 39:05.885
Oh, and I could have seen it,
had I but risen from my sickbed.

39:05.968 --> 39:07.970
-Who told you that?
-More than one person.

39:08.054 --> 39:09.972
Which means
there was probably something to see.

39:11.098 --> 39:13.017
How do you feel
about them fightin' over you?

39:14.185 --> 39:15.811
-Excited.
-Yeah.

39:15.895 --> 39:17.104
Flattered, even.

39:17.188 --> 39:18.147
Mm-hmm.

39:18.230 --> 39:21.692
I mean, right up until the point…
…Annie saw it.

39:21.776 --> 39:22.610
Ouch.

39:22.693 --> 39:24.695
Yeah, she gave me attitude about it later.

39:24.779 --> 39:26.989
You know,
she was just doing her job as a teenager.

39:27.073 --> 39:31.285
Okay, well, I don't know why
she has to be so good at her job.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.787
Now who's taking us out to sea?

39:33.371 --> 39:35.998
-What? Not me!
-Then tell us, Dana Sue.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.710
What does it mean to you
that Ronnie's back?

39:42.963 --> 39:44.632
What do you want now that he's here?

40:46.777 --> 40:49.447
You are so loved. Remember that.

41:23.731 --> 41:26.442
Why, why, why, why?

41:52.426 --> 41:53.636
-Hey.
-Hey.

41:53.719 --> 41:55.804
I, um… I hope it's not too late.

41:56.388 --> 41:57.223
Just, um…

41:57.723 --> 42:01.810
You know, I wanted to thank you
for coming to Summer Market with me.

42:02.603 --> 42:03.812
And… and Annie.

42:04.396 --> 42:07.107
It really meant a lot.

42:11.987 --> 42:12.863
Um…

42:13.614 --> 42:16.825
Can I, um… can I come in for a moment?

42:27.378 --> 42:30.589
You know what? Annie's asleep.
I'd rather not wake her.

42:30.673 --> 42:33.175
Oh, that's… that's not why
I wanted to come in.

42:36.220 --> 42:37.263
It, um…

42:39.390 --> 42:41.350
took a phone call, two,

42:41.850 --> 42:44.353
a little Internet search, but, uh…

42:46.397 --> 42:50.985
turns out the 800-year-old man still makes
that strawberry-banana lip balm.

42:51.569 --> 42:54.196
-Just doesn't go to Summer Market anymore.

42:56.365 --> 42:58.909
Found him and his son over in Egret Falls.

43:03.789 --> 43:04.665
Oh.

43:06.625 --> 43:08.002
-I'd, um…
-Mmm.

43:11.171 --> 43:14.091
…never want you to go without
anything you've been missing.

43:18.262 --> 43:19.179
Thank you…

43:21.348 --> 43:23.017
for bringing this by.

43:23.100 --> 43:24.101
Mm-hmm.

43:39.366 --> 43:40.200
Good night.

43:45.331 --> 43:46.206
Good night.

44:07.311 --> 44:08.187
Ronnie?

44:13.108 --> 44:14.777
One more thing I've been missing…

44:46.767 --> 44:49.144
Hey, honey. I came as soon as I could.

44:49.228 --> 44:50.312
Thanks for coming.

44:50.396 --> 44:51.814
Thanks for inviting me.

44:52.856 --> 44:54.191
So, Kyle, what's going on?

44:55.484 --> 44:57.319
Everything! And I don't know what to do.

44:57.403 --> 45:00.406
I mean, Mom hates me now.
Pretty sure Ty does too.

45:00.489 --> 45:02.074
And Nellie…

45:03.826 --> 45:06.704
Ashley's fine, but what I need most
right now is a friend.

45:09.581 --> 45:10.916
I don't know.
