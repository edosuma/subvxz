00:01.842 --> 00:03.680
You ever have one of those days?

00:03.727 --> 00:05.745
You get out of bed,
you take a shower,

00:05.835 --> 00:08.294
you air-dry
by swinging through the city,

00:08.374 --> 00:11.688
and then out of nowhere, some
jerk in a robo suit attacks you?

00:14.452 --> 00:17.800
Ow! Well, this is definitely
one of those days.

00:17.916 --> 00:20.146
Oh, plus I think I forgot
to brush my teeth.

00:24.023 --> 00:26.957
Taking you down
will be easy, Spider-Man.

00:27.044 --> 00:31.622
Okay, hotshot. That sucker punch surprised
me, but now you've got my attention.

00:31.716 --> 00:34.562
What I want is your life. Sorry!

00:34.676 --> 00:36.628
I'm actually using it right now.

00:41.014 --> 00:44.310
Seems like every joker in town wants
to be my archnemesis these days.

00:44.417 --> 00:46.081
Increase exo-thermal volts.

00:48.387 --> 00:50.300
Whoa!
That's a neat trick.

00:50.393 --> 00:52.419
Have you seen this one?

00:55.149 --> 00:56.161
Hello?

00:56.209 --> 00:57.454
Hey, Pete. You on your way?

00:57.502 --> 00:59.332
Yeah, Harry, uh...

00:59.445 --> 01:01.316
No. Sorry.
I'm not gonna make it.

01:01.636 --> 01:03.457
My schedule kind of
blew up today.

01:03.551 --> 01:05.494
Oh, that's too bad.

01:05.573 --> 01:07.841
I've got some news I wanted
to share with you in person,

01:07.889 --> 01:09.931
but I guess I can tell you
over the phone.

01:10.271 --> 01:11.569
Yeah, but can it wait?

01:11.616 --> 01:13.914
I would really like
my full attention.

01:13.962 --> 01:16.764
I wol guess so. I just thought you
should be the first to know that...

01:16.812 --> 01:19.233
Great!
I'll call you back later.

01:19.928 --> 01:22.128
Yeah. Whatever.

01:24.325 --> 01:26.420
Who are you talking to?

01:26.471 --> 01:28.077
That's for me to know...

01:29.088 --> 01:31.819
And you to stand still while I rip
the wiring from your power pack.

01:32.989 --> 01:34.995
Hey, what are you... Ha!

01:35.115 --> 01:37.908
Without those power circuits,
looks like you can't pull off

01:37.972 --> 01:40.037
that little anti-web trick,
can you?

01:40.251 --> 01:42.372
Now let's see
who you really are.

01:42.684 --> 01:45.377
Self
destruct initiated.

01:45.449 --> 01:47.657
One minute to self destruct.

01:47.740 --> 01:50.478
Fifty-nine, fifty-eight...
Countdowns are never good.

01:55.751 --> 02:00.449
<font color=#FF00FF>*Marvel's SPIDERMAN*</font>

02:01.879 --> 02:03.760
Okay. Think, Spidey. Think.
Fifty-eight...

02:03.808 --> 02:05.985
This thing's too complicated
to diffuse here... 57...

02:06.128 --> 02:08.408
But if I remove the dangerous part...
56,

02:08.512 --> 02:10.283
55...

02:10.339 --> 02:13.119
Spidey feels the pressure.
He's going for the gold! ...54,

02:13.167 --> 02:15.900
53, 52... He spins, and...

02:16.688 --> 02:18.706
51...

02:20.120 --> 02:22.307
Yes! He's done it!

02:22.368 --> 02:25.126
Spidey wins the gold!

02:25.236 --> 02:27.823
He... And why is
my Spidey-sense still tingling?

02:31.960 --> 02:34.262
Thirty-eight, thirty-seven...
Oh, come on!

02:34.310 --> 02:37.488
The head was just the countdown clock?
Who makes these things?

02:37.538 --> 02:40.197
Okay. That
thing probably weighs 400 pounds.

02:40.245 --> 02:41.985
If I want to propel it
out of harm's way

02:42.033 --> 02:44.551
against an average wind speed
of 12 miles per hour,

02:44.638 --> 02:46.894
- the trajectory should be...
- Hey!

02:47.143 --> 02:49.277
You're Spider-Man,
right? Cool.

02:49.341 --> 02:52.106
Hey, can you leave a message
on my friend Phil's phone?

02:52.241 --> 02:54.498
Little busy at the moment.
Carry the one...

02:54.617 --> 02:57.159
16, 15, 14... And... got it!

02:57.238 --> 03:01.234
13, 12, 11...

03:01.387 --> 03:03.473
- Where does your friend live?
- Jersey.

03:03.509 --> 03:05.843
Phil, this is Spider-Man.
Shut your windows... 7, 6,

03:05.930 --> 03:07.932
5, 4, 3,

03:14.885 --> 03:16.926
And that's the power
of geometry.

03:16.974 --> 03:20.287
Alert. First
period in ten minutes.

03:20.343 --> 03:22.646
Nice. With this new
alarm system I created,

03:22.733 --> 03:25.522
I won't ever be late
for class again.

03:27.716 --> 03:30.258
Maybe a little late.
I'll clean it up!

03:33.988 --> 03:36.892
I had him!

03:37.425 --> 03:39.195
Relax, young Smythe.

03:39.298 --> 03:42.571
You control my slayers
as well as your father does.

03:44.059 --> 03:46.450
Welcome to Osborn Academy.

03:48.546 --> 03:50.470
Come on, Harry.
Answer your phone.

03:50.542 --> 03:52.646
Hello?
Harry, it's Peter.

03:52.907 --> 03:54.242
What did you wanna tell me?

03:54.353 --> 03:56.341
I've been cleared
of all charges.

03:56.620 --> 03:58.121
I'm back, baby!

03:58.968 --> 04:02.870
Yes! Harry is in da house!

04:03.888 --> 04:06.271
Sorry, buddy.
I tried to tell you.

04:06.355 --> 04:10.252
No. I'm just... happy
I didn't miss the celebration.

04:10.300 --> 04:13.598
We should celebrate.
Harry's a big part of this school,

04:13.669 --> 04:16.473
so we should do something the
whole school can take part in.

04:16.678 --> 04:18.322
Any ideas?

04:18.459 --> 04:19.898
Let's have another science fair.

04:19.976 --> 04:22.065
No way.
A physics tournament.

04:22.146 --> 04:24.141
All good options.

04:24.292 --> 04:26.698
But maybe something different
this time.

04:26.996 --> 04:29.495
Aleksei, how do they celebrate
in your country?

04:29.636 --> 04:32.618
Mathlympics, baby!
Loser shovels snow.

04:32.809 --> 04:35.860
Phew. I was afraid you were
gonna suggest a dance.

04:36.027 --> 04:38.502
A dance! That's perfect!

04:38.605 --> 04:40.671
We'll have a dance this Saturday night.

04:40.718 --> 04:43.517
Great idea, Peter.

04:43.731 --> 04:45.150
Come on. Excellent!

04:45.253 --> 04:47.307
I was award-winning dancer
at old school.

04:49.812 --> 04:50.908
Oh, no!

04:51.456 --> 04:53.512
Is that... pimple?

04:53.769 --> 04:56.786
B-But I-I-I have to look best
for Saturday!

05:00.068 --> 05:01.483
Ow!

05:01.531 --> 05:02.975
- Aleksei, wait up!
- Anya!

05:03.023 --> 05:04.278
A dance?

05:04.326 --> 05:06.289
Thanks a lot, Parker.

05:07.547 --> 05:11.811
And that's how Horizon High decided
to have its first-ever dance.

05:11.977 --> 05:13.852
I didn't want a dance.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.760
I don't even know how to dance.
I'm a scientist.

05:16.816 --> 05:20.399
Relax, Peter. My Uncle Raymond
is a renowned scientist,

05:20.493 --> 05:22.478
and he taught me to two-step
in an afternoon.

05:22.638 --> 05:25.022
It's all about angles.
And you've got till Saturday.

05:25.070 --> 05:28.144
♪♪ Disco...  Ugh!

05:28.192 --> 05:31.289
It's Saturday, and I still
don't know how to dance.

05:39.121 --> 05:40.524
You hungry?

05:40.641 --> 05:43.771
I figured you need to carb up
if you're gonna boogie down

05:43.819 --> 05:45.839
on that dance floor.

05:47.005 --> 05:49.866
I don't like any of the words
in that sentence, Aunt May.

05:50.064 --> 05:51.566
I don't even wanna go tonight.

05:51.736 --> 05:54.871
But this is Harry's comeback party,
so I can't miss it.

05:54.974 --> 05:57.399
Dancing isn't so bad, Peter.

05:57.803 --> 06:00.166
You just need
to find your rhythm.

06:00.202 --> 06:02.086
♪♪

06:02.261 --> 06:03.937
Uhh...

06:04.255 --> 06:06.788
Where's a super-villain
when you need one?

06:07.709 --> 06:10.570
Come on in, Peter.

06:10.642 --> 06:12.854
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

06:12.979 --> 06:15.115
This stupid tie
set me back half an hour.

06:15.298 --> 06:17.893
The tying of bow ties
is a dying art, Pete.

06:18.031 --> 06:20.437
That's why you have to embrace
the modern age.

06:20.534 --> 06:22.933
You didn't design
a bow-tying machine, did you?

06:24.004 --> 06:25.347
No. I bought a clip-on.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.305
I'm really glad you're back
at Horizon, Harry.

06:29.513 --> 06:32.602
So, how mad was your dad when you told
him you were leaving Osborn Academy?

06:33.868 --> 06:35.462
We haven't
spoken about it yet.

06:35.530 --> 06:38.172
But he wants to see me
when he's done with his meeting.

06:38.542 --> 06:40.133
Why have you returned, Raymond?

06:40.300 --> 06:43.208
I told you, there's nothing
available for you at Oscorp.

06:43.358 --> 06:47.292
Yes, but with the creation
of the Osborn Academy,

06:47.451 --> 06:50.668
I thought you might need
some... faculty.

06:50.932 --> 06:52.677
In exchange for what?

06:52.848 --> 06:55.420
No more spider experiments,
I hope.

06:55.730 --> 06:58.765
Oscorp's board of trustees
is still shaking from that one.

06:58.885 --> 07:02.189
We were forced to confiscate it
from you, if I remember correctly.

07:02.601 --> 07:06.217
I've created something new,
something bold.

07:06.525 --> 07:09.951
My new serum will change
how we think of hybridization.

07:10.155 --> 07:11.379
I'm listening.

07:11.467 --> 07:13.144
In two hours' time,

07:13.308 --> 07:16.155
one of Horizon High's students
is going to undergo

07:16.211 --> 07:19.256
some significant... changes.

07:19.430 --> 07:22.129
- Have a good day, sir.
- Oh, I plan to.

07:22.583 --> 07:24.958
Thanks, old dude! Ow! Hey!

07:25.082 --> 07:28.597
I plan to be on hand
to record the results.

07:29.607 --> 07:31.386
Interesting.

07:32.229 --> 07:35.486
Get me proof of your results,
and we'll talk...

07:36.070 --> 07:38.281
about a possible
faculty position.

07:40.816 --> 07:42.548
Thank you, Norman.

07:45.063 --> 07:48.381
And then she starts dancing
like she's in some disco movie.

07:48.461 --> 07:50.916
No way! Harry,

07:51.361 --> 07:54.516
before you go, a word.

07:54.736 --> 07:58.111
I would say congratulations
on being exonerated,

07:58.765 --> 08:01.465
but you know I never
believed you to be at fault.

08:01.931 --> 08:03.146
Thank you, Dad.

08:03.231 --> 08:05.534
But I just have to wonder.

08:05.709 --> 08:09.030
Why return to Horizon High?

08:09.895 --> 08:14.107
Sure, they have equally impressive
equipment, but do they have your back?

08:14.385 --> 08:17.215
It certainly didn't seem so
during your suspension.

08:17.365 --> 08:20.002
I appreciate everything
you've done for me, Dad.

08:20.072 --> 08:24.403
It's just, I thought I could
make a name for myself.

08:24.714 --> 08:26.811
- At Horizon...
- Make no mistake, Harry.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.987
No matter what
you accomplish in life,

08:29.035 --> 08:32.865
you will always have
the name I provided you.

08:33.230 --> 08:36.900
So why not take advantage
of all that comes with it?

08:37.926 --> 08:42.438
Harry, I poured my soul
into the Osborn Academy

08:42.486 --> 08:46.963
to save you the embarrassment
of crawling back to that school.

08:47.504 --> 08:49.793
How do you think it will look
if you abandon me?

08:50.161 --> 08:53.014
I beg you, as your father,

08:53.486 --> 08:55.778
please stay.

08:58.043 --> 09:00.576
I'll... I'll think about it, Dad.

09:00.671 --> 09:03.486
I have to go.
Pete's waiting on me.

09:06.432 --> 09:09.501
♪♪

09:09.682 --> 09:12.686
Yes! This is my song!

09:12.853 --> 09:15.783
It was really nice of you to volunteer
to chaperone, Uncle Raymond.

09:15.895 --> 09:18.866
- Especially on such short notice.
- Of course.

09:22.237 --> 09:25.872

Aleksei, you okay?

I-I-I'm fine.
I'm fine.

09:34.963 --> 09:36.742
Ju-Ju-Just a headache.

09:36.895 --> 09:39.311
Can I have everyone's attention?

09:39.946 --> 09:42.265
I wanted to say a few words
about why we're here tonight:

09:42.354 --> 09:46.328
To welcome Harry Osborn back
to Horizon High.

09:46.803 --> 09:49.773
As you know, Harry couldn't
be with us for a while,

09:49.908 --> 09:52.628
and during that
time, I think we all felt something.

09:52.684 --> 09:55.700
Something
that wasn't there before.

10:00.684 --> 10:04.402
A void. And that's because
Harry has such a big presence.

10:04.495 --> 10:06.806
His heart is bigger,
his dreams are bigger...

10:09.476 --> 10:11.769
And his generosity is massive.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.605
Of course, the same
can be said for his ego.

10:16.474 --> 10:17.992
But I'll take it all,

10:18.264 --> 10:20.400
because that void
has been filled again,

10:20.631 --> 10:23.904
and I'm happy to say...
welcome back, pal.

10:28.200 --> 10:30.465
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you.

10:31.127 --> 10:34.613
You've all worked so hard to
make this such a special night,

10:34.767 --> 10:38.161
which makes what
I'm about to say even harder.

10:38.736 --> 10:40.764
I'm not coming back
to Horizon High.

10:40.863 --> 10:42.865
I've decided to stay
at Osborn Academy.

10:48.077 --> 10:49.343
Huh?

10:52.333 --> 10:53.633
Great!

10:53.740 --> 10:54.823
More bad news.

10:57.947 --> 10:59.296
Harry, out of the way!

11:05.458 --> 11:07.172
Everybody, stay back!

11:09.071 --> 11:10.441
Look out!

11:12.801 --> 11:15.579
- Fascinating.
- Glad you find it fascinating, Miles,

11:15.627 --> 11:17.696
but don't just sit there
while that thing attacks!

11:17.903 --> 11:19.592
Oh, I doubt he could see me.

11:19.711 --> 11:21.766
Rhinos have really bad eyesight.

11:21.893 --> 11:24.571
And do you know what
they call a group of rhinos?

11:26.510 --> 11:29.021
They're called a... crash.

11:29.090 --> 11:30.586
They're called a crash.

11:34.431 --> 11:37.082

If you're gonna horn in on this dance,
you're gonna have me as a partner.

11:52.741 --> 11:54.419
And I'm not saying
it won't be fun,

11:54.467 --> 11:56.708
but I've been told
I have two left feet.

11:58.240 --> 11:59.527
Oh, no, you don't!

11:59.603 --> 12:01.615
You're not losing me that easy.

12:01.663 --> 12:04.180
Don't you know
it takes two to rhino?

12:04.406 --> 12:06.754
It also takes some scaffolding
and a speaker...

12:06.905 --> 12:08.684
I might be thinking
of "two to tango."

12:08.732 --> 12:11.471
Rhino just takes a face
full of webbing.

12:23.782 --> 12:25.535
Stay back, everyone.

12:25.642 --> 12:28.181
- Wait until the police arrive.
- Is everyone okay?

12:28.239 --> 12:31.270
I don't know. I found pieces
of Aleksei's clothes shredded.

12:31.318 --> 12:34.025
Oh, no! It ate Aleksei!

12:34.326 --> 12:36.045
That wasn't the
point I was making.

12:36.205 --> 12:38.875
I've been working on
a retinal identification app.

12:41.204 --> 12:45.778
And this rhino has the same retinal
print as... Aleksei Sitsevich.

12:45.913 --> 12:48.194
He changed into a rhino?

12:48.337 --> 12:49.821
How is that possible?

12:50.110 --> 12:52.612
More importantly,
can we change him back?

12:52.688 --> 12:55.656
Let's take a blood sample so we
can start working on a cure.

12:56.004 --> 12:59.531
Hey, guys. I was, uh,
calling the police.

13:00.011 --> 13:01.917
- What's going on?
- Harry thinks we should

13:01.965 --> 13:04.212
get a sample
of this rhino thing's blood.

13:04.322 --> 13:06.174
But how are you gonna
pierce the flesh?

13:06.250 --> 13:08.693
That thing's got armor for skin.

13:09.018 --> 13:10.433
Here. Let me.

13:10.664 --> 13:13.412
Rhinos, uh,
have a soft underbelly.

13:13.592 --> 13:15.978
Ask Miles. He knows.
Right, Miles?

13:16.212 --> 13:18.687
Huh? Oh. Yeah.

13:19.179 --> 13:21.010
Soft... Soft belly.

13:21.254 --> 13:23.342
A little Peter Parker strength.

13:25.519 --> 13:26.767
Let's get this to the lab.

13:28.317 --> 13:30.712
Can anyone tell us
what happened?

13:31.050 --> 13:34.276
You guys go to work.
We'll answer questions here.

13:34.385 --> 13:36.563
Okay. The mainframe
is working to isolate

13:36.624 --> 13:38.573
any foreign enzymes
in Alexsei's blood.

13:38.652 --> 13:41.005
I'll check the DNA sequencing.

13:41.911 --> 13:45.676
It's, uh, nice being able
to work together again, Harry.

13:45.870 --> 13:49.141
- This is the way it should be.
- Mm-hmm. Send me those figures.

13:49.292 --> 13:50.824
This can't be right.

13:51.349 --> 13:53.430
I only know one person
who's ever managed

13:53.509 --> 13:55.598
to bond particles this way,
and that's...

13:57.782 --> 14:00.406
Guys, I gotta go.
You keep working.

14:00.461 --> 14:03.179
- I need to check something out.
- Gwen? What are you... Hmm?

14:03.227 --> 14:05.444
- The mainframe found the catalyst.
- Whoa.

14:05.614 --> 14:08.859
His DNA is being overpowered
by Rhinocerotidae genes.

14:08.939 --> 14:10.956
- Can we untangle them?
- I can try,

14:11.004 --> 14:14.610
but this genetic strain will
require its own anti-diffuser.

14:14.705 --> 14:16.512
That's Gwen's field.

14:17.305 --> 14:18.830
Did Gwen come back this way?

14:19.075 --> 14:20.975
Yeah. She was looking
for her uncle.

14:21.141 --> 14:23.510
I told her I saw him leave
during the stampede.

14:23.633 --> 14:27.458
She turned white and ran out of here.
Said she'd check his house.

14:27.609 --> 14:30.637
I should go after her. See how
she's doing with that diffuser.

14:30.901 --> 14:32.435
- You all right here?
- Yeah.

14:32.751 --> 14:35.618
The police are about to haul
the big guy outta here.

14:46.893 --> 14:48.989
Come on, Spidey.
Thwip faster.

14:49.851 --> 14:52.537
Why does Professor Warren
have to live so far from school?

14:57.697 --> 14:59.220
Uncle Raymond?

15:00.661 --> 15:01.788
Are you here?

15:04.371 --> 15:05.705
Hello?

15:13.857 --> 15:15.083
The Jackal!

15:15.206 --> 15:17.439
Aw, you remember.

15:17.575 --> 15:21.174
Now prepare for a fight
you'll never forget.

15:23.590 --> 15:24.735
Stay back, young lady.

15:24.805 --> 15:26.929
I know the neighborhood's
going green.

15:31.805 --> 15:35.577
But you don't seem the least bit
eco-friendly, let alone regular friendly.

15:39.042 --> 15:40.703
Where do you think you're going?

15:41.454 --> 15:43.035
- Get outta here!
- But...

15:48.846 --> 15:51.208
I can play tug-of-war all day.

15:51.746 --> 15:54.912
Okay, so you're more of a red light/green
light kind of guy. I get it.

16:16.770 --> 16:20.346
Uncle Raymond? You're the Jackal?

16:23.699 --> 16:26.510
I don't know how you found me,
Spider-Man,

16:26.616 --> 16:29.679
but no one's going
to find you, ever!

16:37.901 --> 16:41.269
Maybe now I can dissect you
and analyze how Spider-Man

16:41.336 --> 16:44.280
can do whatever a spider can.

16:44.505 --> 16:47.258
Something about you seems a little too
famil...

16:47.305 --> 16:48.468
Aah!

16:48.516 --> 16:49.523
Aahh!

16:50.944 --> 16:51.963
Gwen!

16:52.184 --> 16:53.538
What did you...

16:59.548 --> 17:01.845
The Jackal is
Professor Raymond Warren?

17:01.893 --> 17:05.160
Worse.
The Jackal is my uncle.

17:05.406 --> 17:06.575
I'm sorry.

17:06.623 --> 17:10.560
Turns out he was also behind Aleksei's
transformation into the rhino.

17:11.338 --> 17:15.454
But the good news is, we now have
the diffuser needed to cure him.

17:16.354 --> 17:18.507
I could swing us across town
in no time,

17:18.609 --> 17:21.462
but someone should explain things
to the police when they get here.

17:21.510 --> 17:23.227
I'll stay here
and wait with him.

17:23.401 --> 17:25.165
He is family, after all.

17:26.623 --> 17:28.040
Pete! Harry?

17:28.089 --> 17:30.329
Aleksei rhinoed out again.
Don't come back here.

17:30.377 --> 17:33.021
This place is a madhouse.
I couldn't find the cure.

17:33.175 --> 17:35.723
Don't worry. Gwen did.
She sent it over with...

17:35.929 --> 17:37.304
Spider-Man.

17:44.958 --> 17:47.156
Boy, rhinos don't sleep
very long, do they?

17:51.845 --> 17:53.366

Disgraced Professor Raymond
Warren is in the news again,

18:41.920 --> 18:44.886
this time for allegedly
experimenting on teenagers.

18:45.187 --> 18:48.016
Aleksei Sitsevich,
a student at Horizon High,

18:48.064 --> 18:50.186
suffered a unique reaction
when he was transformed

18:50.234 --> 18:52.442
into a genetically modified
human rhinoceros.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.667
Fortunately, the quick-thinking
students of Horizon

I just don't get it, Peter.
Why would Uncle Raymond do this?

19:26.987 --> 19:30.134
He's the one who got me
into science in the first place.

19:30.222 --> 19:33.749
Why would he betray everything
he taught me to stand for?

19:37.952 --> 19:41.415
Gwen, there's not
much I can say,

19:41.570 --> 19:46.164
but, well, my uncle got me
into science too.

19:46.485 --> 19:50.758
He once told me that "with great
power comes great responsibility."

19:51.466 --> 19:54.683
It seems like your uncle
just lost sight of that.

19:56.050 --> 19:57.377
But if I've learned anything,

19:57.494 --> 20:01.225
it's that even though the person
who inspired you might be gone,

20:01.642 --> 20:04.192
it doesn't mean he can't
still be here...

20:05.837 --> 20:07.153
or here.

20:07.765 --> 20:09.880
Or here?

20:10.191 --> 20:13.654
Yeah. That was something
my uncle came up with.

an important meaning.

Well, if we learned
anything this weekend,
