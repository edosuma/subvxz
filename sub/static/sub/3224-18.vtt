00:03.472 --> 00:05.030
Dean, I could really use
your help down here.

00:05.207 --> 00:06.367
I'm getting close, Sam.

00:06.441 --> 00:08.568
I can't drop the ball
on Abaddon right now.

00:08.744 --> 00:10.405
I can give you the Mark, Dean,
if it's what you truly want.

00:10.579 --> 00:13.707
But you have to know with
the Mark comes a great burden.

00:13.882 --> 00:15.322
What is it you want of me, Metatron?

00:15.417 --> 00:16.645
Rebuild heaven.

00:16.818 --> 00:19.309
You want to be
my second-in-command,

00:19.488 --> 00:20.785
prove you're ready.

00:20.956 --> 00:25.723
Gadreel, we are writing
our own epic story here.

00:28.363 --> 00:29.403
I got my grace back.

00:29.498 --> 00:31.432
Not mine per Se, but it'll do.

00:31.600 --> 00:34.728
Angels fighting angels
has to stop somewhere.

00:37.372 --> 00:38.932
You've showed me
that there is a choice.

00:39.041 --> 00:40.167
I'm no leader.

00:40.342 --> 00:41.138
I will follow you.

00:41.309 --> 00:43.412
And I am not the only one.

01:15.844 --> 01:18.779
What makes a story work?

01:18.947 --> 01:24.283
Is it the plot,
the characters, the text?

01:25.787 --> 01:27.778
The subtext?

01:30.225 --> 01:32.216
And who gives a story meaning?

01:32.394 --> 01:33.759
Is it the writer?

01:36.098 --> 01:37.429
Or you?

01:39.468 --> 01:43.700
Tonight, I thought
I would tell you a little story...

01:44.873 --> 01:47.933
...and let you decide. â™ª

02:24.980 --> 02:25.980
Yeah. All right.

02:26.882 --> 02:28.110
Thanks, Carlos.

02:28.283 --> 02:30.478
Listen, you, uh, if you catch wind of
any other demon activity,

02:30.652 --> 02:32.813
give me a holler, all right?

02:32.988 --> 02:34.387
Appreciate it.

02:34.556 --> 02:35.989
Hey.

02:36.158 --> 02:38.183
- Anything?
- Yeah.

02:38.326 --> 02:40.123
A dozen demon-related cases,

02:40.295 --> 02:43.025
people without souls
acting out, but...

02:43.198 --> 02:46.133
- But no sign of Abaddon.
- Right. Looks like she's vanished.

02:46.802 --> 02:49.566
- Well, we just got to keep digging.
- Right.

02:51.573 --> 02:54.167
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

02:55.443 --> 02:58.469
- Let's get to work.
- All right.

04:12.687 --> 04:14.951
Please, please don't!

04:15.123 --> 04:16.851
- Don't hurt me.
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

04:17.125 --> 04:19.457
It's okay.

04:22.397 --> 04:23.921
What's your name?

04:25.300 --> 04:26.460
Hannah.

04:26.635 --> 04:30.662
Hannah, what happened here?

04:36.177 --> 04:38.873
Yeah, I heard it, too.
What was it?

04:39.047 --> 04:41.709
I don't know.

04:42.217 --> 04:47.348
It...
It sounded familiar.

04:47.522 --> 04:48.682
It sounded like heaven.

04:48.857 --> 04:53.021
It's so strange down here.

04:53.194 --> 04:55.924
I... followed the tone

04:56.097 --> 04:58.793
and found so many of my brothers
and sisters had, as well.

04:58.967 --> 05:01.765
It felt safe here,

05:01.937 --> 05:05.771
and then the doors slammed shut
and a strange angel arrived.

05:05.941 --> 05:08.409
He said he worked for the new God.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.373
For Metatron?

05:12.113 --> 05:14.741
He made us an offer...

05:15.517 --> 05:19.544
Join Metatron, fight for him,

05:19.721 --> 05:22.849
and those that did would one day
be allowed to return to heaven.

05:23.024 --> 05:24.082
Return to heaven?

05:27.228 --> 05:30.026
I didn't believe him, either.

05:31.166 --> 05:33.134
But he said
he would take us home.

05:33.301 --> 05:36.236
Some angels joined him.

05:36.404 --> 05:40.670
My friends and I... refused, and...

05:43.178 --> 05:45.476
I'm sorry for your loss.

05:47.282 --> 05:49.375
For all our loss.

06:01.396 --> 06:04.422
You're Castiel, aren't you?

06:04.599 --> 06:06.066
Yes.

06:06.234 --> 06:08.634
You took a stand
against Bartholomew.

06:08.803 --> 06:11.237
Are you going to help us,
lead us against Metatron?

06:11.439 --> 06:12.439
I'm no leader.

06:13.708 --> 06:16.074
- But you...
- I am no leader, Hannah.

06:16.244 --> 06:19.543
But I will find Metatron,
and I make him pay.

06:21.516 --> 06:22.608
Let me help you.

06:22.784 --> 06:24.308
Let us help you.

06:24.486 --> 06:26.852
You are safer away from me.

06:27.322 --> 06:30.849
Now, this angel who attacked you,

06:31.026 --> 06:32.026
what was his name?

06:32.160 --> 06:33.388
Gadreel?

06:33.561 --> 06:36.462
Gadreel is working for Metatron?

06:36.631 --> 06:38.258
- For how long?
- I don't know.

06:40.301 --> 06:43.634
So, Metatron made
Gadreel kill Kevin?

06:44.239 --> 06:45.831
It would explain a lot,

06:46.007 --> 06:48.908
and there have been
no new prophets,

06:49.077 --> 06:51.671
which Metatron could have
fixed to his advantage.

06:51.846 --> 06:53.643
And Gadreel said that angels
are returning to heaven? How?

06:53.815 --> 06:54.975
I thought that the spell
was irreversible.

06:55.150 --> 06:56.412
That's what Crowley said.

06:56.584 --> 06:59.781
Look, let's just find Gadreel,
and beat some answers out of him.

06:59.954 --> 07:01.683
Yeah, here's something
to start with that.

07:01.856 --> 07:04.222
Hold on, I'm...

07:04.392 --> 07:06.053
Sending you a photo of the symbol

07:06.227 --> 07:08.457
- that drew all the angels in.
- Okay.

07:13.401 --> 07:14.425
Got it.

07:14.569 --> 07:17.402
Its acting as some
kind of angel siren.

07:17.739 --> 07:19.036
I think it's a spell.

07:19.207 --> 07:21.437
The ingredients used
to create it were very odd.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.474
Griffin feathers, bones of a fairy.

07:23.645 --> 07:25.977
- I've never seen it before.
- Yeah. Me neither.

07:26.147 --> 07:28.615
All right.
Let me see what I can find.

07:28.783 --> 07:29.807
"Honor bar."

07:29.984 --> 07:33.385
What's honorable about
a miniature bar in a motel room?

07:34.222 --> 07:35.280
Everything.

07:37.859 --> 07:38.859
How are you, Dean?

07:41.096 --> 07:42.859
I'm fine, Cass.
How about you?

07:43.565 --> 07:45.931
I miss my wings.

07:46.101 --> 07:48.797
Life on the road... smells.

07:49.070 --> 07:52.062
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.400
Listen, I got a match,

07:53.575 --> 07:55.839
and it's not from the lore,
it's from police records.

07:56.010 --> 07:57.602
Looks like that symbol you found

07:57.779 --> 07:59.339
was spotted
at a handful of crime scenes

07:59.380 --> 08:01.473
the last couple days,
all multiple homicides.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.583
And where were
these crime scenes?

08:03.751 --> 08:06.743
Uh, Utah, Baker, Hill Valley.

08:06.921 --> 08:08.889
And I'm in Bishop's Falls, Utah.

08:09.057 --> 08:11.252
Also looks like
most of the crime scenes

08:11.426 --> 08:12.552
were in industrial areas.

08:12.727 --> 08:14.490
Looks like Gadreel
is heading north.

08:14.662 --> 08:16.289
What's the next big town?

08:16.464 --> 08:18.489
There are two.
It could be Auburn or Ogden.

08:18.666 --> 08:21.829
All right, you take Auburn,
we'll take Ogden, meet in the middle.

08:35.717 --> 08:37.207
Didn't we work a case in Ogden?

08:39.254 --> 08:42.052
Yeah. It was a...
a witch situation, right?

08:42.222 --> 08:43.383
Yeah.

08:43.558 --> 08:45.355
There was that kid in town
that helped us, wasn't there?

08:45.527 --> 08:47.461
Yes. We should call him,
see if he's still in business.

08:47.629 --> 08:48.789
Yeah. What was his name?

09:02.310 --> 09:05.370
- Good afternoon.
- It's afternoon?

09:05.580 --> 09:10.176
I wonder if I may procure from you
the feathers of a Griffin?

09:11.219 --> 09:13.517
Uh...

09:13.888 --> 09:16.049
We got some off-the-menu items,

09:16.224 --> 09:19.523
but, uh, this ain't
Diagon Alley, man.

09:21.863 --> 09:23.854
I saw the Hunter signs
on the door, young man.

09:24.032 --> 09:26.728
You have what I seek.

09:28.670 --> 09:30.638
Griffin feathers, huh?

09:30.805 --> 09:34.605
Not exactly looking to trip
the light fantastic, are we?

09:37.478 --> 09:40.140
Humans never cease to amaze me.

09:40.315 --> 09:42.044
Excuse me?

09:42.217 --> 09:44.685
I'm curious...
do you also have fairy bones?

09:44.852 --> 09:47.013
It does not matter
what realm they were from.

09:48.623 --> 09:51.717
Griffins and fairies...
the hell you hunting, man?

09:53.061 --> 09:54.153
Family.

09:55.863 --> 09:56.863
Okay.

09:56.965 --> 09:59.126
Let me see what we have here.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.046
Sometimes you need a break

10:18.219 --> 10:19.948
from the hustle
and bustle of city life.

10:20.121 --> 10:21.713
Hashtag am I rite?

10:23.091 --> 10:27.585
Sometimes you need,
hashtag casa erotica.

10:27.762 --> 10:30.060
Casa erotica.

10:30.231 --> 10:32.028
That's inappropriate.

10:42.310 --> 10:43.504
Hello.

10:44.712 --> 10:47.476
- Remember me, bucko?
- Gabriel.

10:48.683 --> 10:50.776
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

11:01.296 --> 11:03.594
I need your help, brother.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.397
I thought you were dead.

11:10.571 --> 11:11.571
Please.

11:11.706 --> 11:15.005
You can't take the trick
out of the Trickster.

11:15.176 --> 11:17.041
So, I assume
you faked your own death?

11:17.211 --> 11:19.873
And I assume you weren't let
into Mensa while I was gone.

11:21.549 --> 11:22.549
Where have you been?

11:23.217 --> 11:24.650
Ohh...

11:25.019 --> 11:28.045
You know, hither with a side of yon.

11:29.590 --> 11:31.888
I was hiding, captain side-eyes...

11:32.593 --> 11:36.529
...in the safest place
in the universe. Heaven.

11:37.231 --> 11:40.291
But then you
and the other two stooges

11:40.468 --> 11:43.801
had to go and ruin Christmas,
now, didn't you?

11:43.971 --> 11:46.565
- Sorry.
- Oh, cry me a river.

11:49.610 --> 11:50.975
Look...

11:51.145 --> 11:53.272
I dropped, I hid.

11:53.448 --> 11:54.972
I finally watched Downton Abbey.

11:55.149 --> 11:59.518
But then, your BFF, Metatron,
sent his minions out looking for me.

11:59.687 --> 12:02.349
Apparently, he thinks
since I'm an archangel

12:02.523 --> 12:03.922
that I have extra juice.

12:04.092 --> 12:05.821
And that you're a threat?

12:06.094 --> 12:08.790
Yeah, but I got hurt
in the fall, too.

12:08.963 --> 12:11.193
Used most of my juice
to get back into porn.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.495
That came out wrong.

12:14.669 --> 12:16.432
So did that.

12:16.604 --> 12:19.129
The point is,
I've been on the run.

12:19.307 --> 12:22.902
But then, a few weeks ago,

12:23.077 --> 12:26.240
somebody started playing my song.

12:26.414 --> 12:27.745
The angel siren.

12:27.915 --> 12:29.815
No.

12:29.984 --> 12:31.315
The horn of Gabriel.

12:32.286 --> 12:34.311
One of Dad's little party favors

12:34.489 --> 12:36.354
that I never got around
to messing with.

12:36.524 --> 12:39.721
Metatron dug it up
and started blowing.

12:40.561 --> 12:43.462
So, I came out of hiding.

12:44.899 --> 12:46.161
Why?

12:46.334 --> 12:49.303
There's safety in numbers.

12:49.470 --> 12:52.439
But Metatron was using it
to trap angels,

12:52.607 --> 12:54.040
not unite them.

12:54.208 --> 12:55.402
It wasn't Metatron.

12:55.576 --> 12:58.511
It was his
second-in-command, Gadreel.

12:58.679 --> 13:00.806
Gadreel?

13:00.982 --> 13:02.882
That old chestnut? Wow!

13:03.050 --> 13:04.915
What do you want from me?

13:06.821 --> 13:10.518
Your help, Columbo.
I'm getting the band back together.

13:11.793 --> 13:14.421
We're going
on the kill Metatron tour...

13:15.630 --> 13:17.530
And you're looking
at the new front man.

13:24.138 --> 13:25.138
Sam.

13:47.295 --> 13:49.058
Got an open box
of feathers over here.

13:55.803 --> 13:56.997
Dean.

14:02.710 --> 14:05.543
We got to find Gadreel before
he lights up the Bat-Signal.

14:06.747 --> 14:10.342
This is Dean's other,
other cell, so you must know what to do.

14:11.152 --> 14:13.450
- Dean, it's me. I'm...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:13.621 --> 14:15.111
Hands-free much?

14:15.289 --> 14:18.019
Both on the wheel.
I'm precious cargo.

14:18.192 --> 14:20.183
Hey, what's up, shorties?

14:20.361 --> 14:23.797
Remember me,
the guy who died for your sins?

14:23.965 --> 14:26.092
No, not the cat
with the beard and sandals...

14:26.400 --> 14:27.400
The hot one.

14:27.568 --> 14:29.798
Hey, thank you so much

14:29.971 --> 14:31.939
for the flowers and condolences...

14:32.106 --> 14:34.336
Really meant a lot to the fam.

14:34.509 --> 14:39.446
Any old how, your boy-toy
and I are rolling our way

14:39.614 --> 14:42.481
towards your
top secret domicile. Ooh!

14:42.650 --> 14:43.650
Call to discuss.

14:44.452 --> 14:46.352
Those kooky kids.

14:46.521 --> 14:48.512
So, you've been back for months.

14:49.824 --> 14:52.315
What have you seen out there?

14:52.493 --> 14:56.452
After it was raining winged men?
Hallelujah.

14:56.631 --> 15:00.658
Well, you know,
total nigh-biblical chaos,

15:00.835 --> 15:06.296
Crowley and ABA-douche
duking it out.

15:06.474 --> 15:08.203
Good times.

15:09.010 --> 15:13.709
And then there's our peeps,
scattered like confetti.

15:15.283 --> 15:17.911
There has been a lot of confusion.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.143
You think?

15:20.221 --> 15:22.451
Most angels aren't like us, Castiel.

15:23.391 --> 15:26.952
They can't handle
this whole free-will thing.

15:28.229 --> 15:31.721
They're sheep... drones.

15:32.800 --> 15:35.997
But us?
We're different.

15:37.004 --> 15:38.062
We're rebels...

15:39.507 --> 15:43.409
One without a cause... one with.

15:44.078 --> 15:46.740
- I'm just a soldier.
- Bitch, please.

15:46.914 --> 15:49.212
You've been God
more often than Dad has.

15:49.383 --> 15:50.645
Yeah.

15:50.818 --> 15:51.818
Look how that worked out.

15:53.554 --> 15:57.046
Well... go ahead.

15:57.224 --> 15:59.317
Be a soldier all you want.

15:59.493 --> 16:01.393
I'm gonna need
as many as I can find.

16:01.562 --> 16:04.224
Why are you doing this, Gabriel?

16:04.398 --> 16:06.559
I always run.

16:06.734 --> 16:09.464
From Dad, from the family.

16:09.637 --> 16:12.731
I don't want to run anymore.

16:12.907 --> 16:16.240
I want to do
what I was meant to do. Lead.

16:20.047 --> 16:22.311
Well, we need a leader.

16:22.483 --> 16:24.747
And I'm happy it's gonna be you.

16:31.192 --> 16:33.319
A little low on gas, aren't we?

16:42.303 --> 16:44.032
Ooh...

16:44.238 --> 16:45.432
Smell that cancer.

16:45.606 --> 16:48.336
Delicious!

16:53.347 --> 16:54.507
Uhh...

16:55.549 --> 16:58.985
Remember the minions
of Metatron I mentioned?

17:51.672 --> 17:53.867
Cass, it's Sam, again.

17:54.408 --> 17:56.137
Call us. We need your help.

18:00.081 --> 18:01.241
Hey, douchebag.

18:06.787 --> 18:08.049
Remember me?

18:16.497 --> 18:18.362
We'll never keep
these guys out of here.

18:18.532 --> 18:21.558
I know. So... we fight.

18:22.470 --> 18:24.404
No. I fight.

18:26.907 --> 18:28.397
I lied before.

18:29.543 --> 18:31.101
I never watched Downton Abbey.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.677
I was just trying to fit in.

18:32.847 --> 18:36.476
Oh, and I do have
some archangel juice left.

18:36.650 --> 18:38.584
I can hold these
boneheads off long enough.

18:38.753 --> 18:40.152
Long enough for what?

18:41.155 --> 18:43.817
- For you to get out of here.
- No, I'm not leaving you.

18:44.091 --> 18:45.558
Yes, you are.

18:45.726 --> 18:47.387
Those guys will cut you to ribbons.

18:47.561 --> 18:51.657
But I can stall them
long enough for you to amscray.

18:51.832 --> 18:53.732
And you can take my place.

18:53.901 --> 18:55.163
What are you talking about?

18:55.336 --> 18:57.896
The angels need a leader,

18:58.072 --> 19:01.200
and it's got to be somebody like us,
somebody different.

19:01.375 --> 19:02.375
No.

19:02.543 --> 19:05.637
I know you don't want
this burden, Castiel.

19:05.813 --> 19:08.145
Neither do I.

19:08.315 --> 19:10.215
What if I fail again?

19:11.819 --> 19:12.819
You won't.

19:13.287 --> 19:14.879
You can't.

19:20.861 --> 19:22.988
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

19:33.808 --> 19:36.538
Haven't got all day, hot-pants.

19:36.710 --> 19:37.870
Was any of this real?

19:38.045 --> 19:40.445
What the hell
are you talking about?

19:41.182 --> 19:42.774
Cass, go!

19:44.285 --> 19:45.582
So, what?
We both die here?

19:45.753 --> 19:48.153
No. You're already dead.

19:50.591 --> 19:52.218
Well.

19:57.965 --> 19:59.455
What gave it all away?

19:59.633 --> 20:02.727
My coat was torn earlier today.

20:02.870 --> 20:04.201
Oh, crap.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.931
I really hate continuity errors.

20:07.575 --> 20:10.703
So, none of this is real...

20:10.878 --> 20:14.473
And I'm guessing
I'm... no longer in the motel.

20:14.648 --> 20:16.673
Here's the thing...

20:16.851 --> 20:20.116
None of it was real,
but all of it was true.

20:20.287 --> 20:22.983
Whose truth?
Yours or Metatron's?

20:23.157 --> 20:26.126
Just hear him out, would you?
He's trying to help you.

20:26.293 --> 20:27.658
Really? How?

20:30.598 --> 20:34.034
Sorry, didn't read the whole script.

20:34.568 --> 20:36.832
Just... skimmed for my parts.

20:38.272 --> 20:41.764
Well...
it's good to see you, old bean.

20:43.811 --> 20:44.869
Wait.

20:46.981 --> 20:48.278
Are you dead?

21:08.068 --> 21:10.366
What makes a story work?

21:18.379 --> 21:21.940
If this is like looking
into a fun-house mirror for me,

21:22.116 --> 21:24.448
I cannot imagine
what it is like for you.

21:24.618 --> 21:26.108
How long have you been
working for Metatron?

21:26.287 --> 21:29.620
I will not talk,
and you cannot make me.

21:29.790 --> 21:30.848
Yeah?

21:31.025 --> 21:32.959
I have been you, Sam Winchester.

21:33.127 --> 21:35.721
Your insides reek
of shame and weakness.

21:40.167 --> 21:44.297
Sam, Sam, Sam!
Sam. Come here.

21:44.471 --> 21:48.066
Tonight, I thought
I'd tell you a little story...

21:49.777 --> 21:51.074
Let you decide.

21:56.450 --> 21:58.509
That was my plan, anyway.

22:04.458 --> 22:08.394
I guess
that's where my story failed.

22:13.233 --> 22:14.860
Yes.

22:15.569 --> 22:21.769
This is "the curious incident,"
eh, Inspector Gregory?

22:21.942 --> 22:23.773
Who?

22:23.944 --> 22:26.071
Inspector Gregory.

22:26.246 --> 22:28.339
Sherlock Holmes.

22:29.016 --> 22:30.643
Silver Blaze?

22:31.218 --> 22:33.379
You have been around

22:33.554 --> 22:36.580
since scaly things
crawled out of the muck.

22:36.757 --> 22:40.284
Would it have killed you
to pick up a book, watch a movie?

22:40.461 --> 22:41.985
Here.

22:42.162 --> 22:43.857
I know it's a bit of a retcon,

22:44.031 --> 22:46.431
but it's gonna make this whole
conversation a lot easier.

22:51.905 --> 22:56.740
I just gave you every book,
movie, and TV show

22:56.910 --> 22:58.790
I have consumed
in the last couple of millennia.

22:59.847 --> 23:01.007
Now do you understand

23:01.181 --> 23:05.049
that "the universe is made up
of stories, not atoms?"

23:07.588 --> 23:11.319
I understand that that's a quote
by Muriel Rukeyser.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.153
Ahh!

23:13.727 --> 23:15.354
It can be taught.

23:16.230 --> 23:18.494
Here are a few more lessons.

23:18.665 --> 23:22.032
Steal from the best.

23:22.202 --> 23:23.760
Second rule:

23:23.937 --> 23:26.633
Every hero needs a villain.

23:27.674 --> 23:29.665
What are you talking you about?

23:29.843 --> 23:33.279
Hannah and her sisters...

23:33.447 --> 23:36.143
I set all that up.

23:36.316 --> 23:40.343
Told Gadreel, "Slaughter all those
who will not join my army,

23:40.521 --> 23:44.423
but let one live, one...

23:45.859 --> 23:47.121
To tell the tale."

23:48.595 --> 23:50.392
Is it true?

23:50.564 --> 23:52.964
Can you bring angels
back to heaven?

23:54.802 --> 23:56.736
Sorry. No spoilers.

23:57.538 --> 23:59.597
And you keep missing the point.

23:59.773 --> 24:01.741
You're supposed
to lead the angels.

24:02.443 --> 24:05.105
I am not a leader, Metatron.

24:05.279 --> 24:06.279
Apparently.

24:08.649 --> 24:13.313
So... I did my homework.

24:15.722 --> 24:18.213
The Winchester Gospels.

24:18.392 --> 24:21.088
Pulpy stuff.

24:23.363 --> 24:25.558
Gave me an idea, though.

24:25.732 --> 24:28.166
You needed to be taught a lesson,

24:28.335 --> 24:32.465
and nobody teaches lessons
better than good old Gabriel.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.531
AKA the Trickster.

24:35.709 --> 24:40.772
So... I started typing.

24:40.948 --> 24:44.315
And you did all this...
to make me a hero?

24:51.358 --> 24:53.792
Uh... that's priceless.

24:53.994 --> 24:55.484
Um...

24:56.897 --> 24:58.660
No.

24:58.832 --> 25:03.599
You are not the hero
in this masterpiece.

25:04.104 --> 25:05.196
You are the villain.

25:09.042 --> 25:10.042
I'm the hero.

25:10.878 --> 25:12.641
He's not gonna crack
that fast.

25:13.380 --> 25:14.438
I know.

25:14.648 --> 25:16.138
Maybe you could hack him
like you and Crowley hacked me.

25:16.316 --> 25:18.250
No, no, no, no.
Crowley's the only one who can do that.

25:18.418 --> 25:20.113
And I'm in no mood
to call that dickbag.

25:20.287 --> 25:21.845
We need Cass.

25:22.022 --> 25:23.148
Any word from him?

25:23.323 --> 25:24.950
No. I tried him again.

25:25.125 --> 25:27.355
He hasn't called,
he hasn't texted.

25:27.528 --> 25:29.928
I turned on the GPS on his phone.

25:30.097 --> 25:32.565
He's still in the same town
where we talked to him last.

25:32.733 --> 25:34.724
- What the hell?
- I don't know.

25:34.902 --> 25:37.097
- You got to go find him.
- What?

25:37.337 --> 25:40.829
- You're too close to this, man.
- And, what, you're not?

25:41.008 --> 25:42.873
We're not at this five minutes,

25:43.043 --> 25:45.170
and you're already going
Liam Neeson on his ass.

25:45.546 --> 25:47.138
I got this.

26:02.362 --> 26:06.230
So... he acts tough,
and you show kindness.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.526
Is that how this works?

26:10.837 --> 26:11.837
No.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.237
See, I don't care whether you talk.

26:16.176 --> 26:18.201
You're gonna pay
for what you did to him...

26:18.879 --> 26:20.073
...and Kevin.

26:21.014 --> 26:24.074
Do you know why I didn't kill you

26:24.251 --> 26:26.879
after I stole your grace?

26:28.355 --> 26:29.913
I like you.

26:30.090 --> 26:31.887
Truly.

26:33.427 --> 26:37.261
Among all God's
little windup toys...

26:38.365 --> 26:40.492
...you were the only one
with any spunk.

26:41.868 --> 26:43.802
I left you human because I was hoping

26:43.971 --> 26:45.871
you would live happily ever after.

26:47.007 --> 26:49.908
But you screwed that up, too.

26:50.077 --> 26:51.544
And now...

26:52.713 --> 26:54.374
...you leave me no choice.

26:55.549 --> 26:57.389
I mean, if you want to
get back on board, fine,

26:57.517 --> 26:59.951
but you're gonna have to
follow my script.

27:00.320 --> 27:03.881
Well, based on your assessment,
that doesn't sound like me.

27:04.891 --> 27:09.658
Lead the dumb, disenfranchised,
rebellious angels

27:09.830 --> 27:11.889
against me, Castiel.

27:12.065 --> 27:13.862
They will follow you.

27:14.034 --> 27:16.559
And they'll all die...

27:17.371 --> 27:22.866
...but I'm gonna save a nice,
warm seat up top for you.

27:23.677 --> 27:25.474
- You will be saved.
- No.

27:29.983 --> 27:32.417
You're gonna make me do
the hard pitch, aren't you?

27:33.754 --> 27:37.155
How's that... stolen grace
inside you working out?

27:40.761 --> 27:41.761
It's fine.

27:42.562 --> 27:44.792
No. It's not.

27:46.066 --> 27:47.499
It's burning out.

27:47.668 --> 27:49.260
It's gonna burn you out.

27:50.404 --> 27:52.804
But... I will give you

27:52.973 --> 27:56.932
an endless supply
of rechargeable batteries.

27:58.578 --> 28:00.170
Deal?

28:03.150 --> 28:05.983
Sorry to interrupt
your writing session, sir,

28:06.153 --> 28:07.620
but something's happened.

28:07.788 --> 28:08.846
What's wrong?

28:09.022 --> 28:10.683
It's Gadreel.

28:15.796 --> 28:17.787
Word around the campfire is,

28:17.964 --> 28:20.125
you let the snake into the garden,

28:20.300 --> 28:22.461
ruined it for all humanity.

28:22.636 --> 28:24.331
I set them free.

28:24.504 --> 28:26.495
I loved humanity!

28:26.673 --> 28:29.335
Well, you sure got a funny
way of showing it, ass-hat.

28:30.510 --> 28:34.571
Now, look, you tell me about this
getting back into heaven crap,

28:34.748 --> 28:36.375
and I'll end this quick.

28:36.550 --> 28:41.681
Otherwise... you can sit here
and rot in those chains forever.

28:41.855 --> 28:43.686
Up to you.

28:43.857 --> 28:47.258
All your talk, all your bluster...

28:47.427 --> 28:49.418
You think you are invincible.

28:49.596 --> 28:52.497
The two of you
against the world, right?

28:52.666 --> 28:54.531
Damn straight.

28:54.701 --> 28:57.499
You really think Sam
would do anything for you?

28:57.671 --> 28:59.571
Oh, I know he would.

28:59.740 --> 29:01.901
I have been
in your brother's body, Dean.

29:02.075 --> 29:05.374
He would not trade
his life for yours.

29:06.480 --> 29:07.970
Well, thanks for the rerun, pal.

29:08.148 --> 29:09.740
Sam's already told me
all that crap.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.178
Hell, he's told me worse.

29:11.351 --> 29:14.582
He told you that
he has always felt that way,

29:14.755 --> 29:17.087
that he thinks that
you are just a scared little boy

29:17.257 --> 29:18.884
who's afraid to be on his own

29:19.059 --> 29:22.051
because Daddy
never loved him enough?

29:24.231 --> 29:27.359
And he is right, isn't he?

29:27.534 --> 29:29.764
Right to think you are a coward...

29:29.936 --> 29:32.530
A sad, clingy, needy...

29:35.776 --> 29:36.834
Keep it up!

29:37.010 --> 29:38.910
...pathetic bottom-feeder

29:39.079 --> 29:41.843
who cannot even take care of himself.

29:42.015 --> 29:46.008
Who would rather drag everyone
through the mud than be alone,

29:46.186 --> 29:49.644
who would let everyone
around him die!

29:57.898 --> 29:59.388
No. Do it.

30:00.734 --> 30:01.928
Do it!

30:02.102 --> 30:03.501
Kill me!

30:03.670 --> 30:06.070
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

30:07.174 --> 30:09.233
That's what that whole
speech was about?

30:11.244 --> 30:14.042
You're not afraid to die, are you?

30:15.282 --> 30:18.342
You're afraid to be left
in these chains forever.

30:19.920 --> 30:24.516
Well, you can sit here and rot...
you son of bitch.

31:55.715 --> 31:57.205
Easy there, tiger.

31:57.384 --> 31:58.715
I'm here to trade.

31:59.953 --> 32:01.978
You have something of mine,

32:02.155 --> 32:04.453
and I have something of yours.

32:12.699 --> 32:16.897
Bring him here tomorrow,
say... six-ish?

32:17.771 --> 32:20.296
If not, Castiel dies.

32:21.775 --> 32:23.504
No comebacks this time.

32:24.544 --> 32:25.875
An even trade?

32:27.013 --> 32:29.311
I'm an entity of my word.

33:00.146 --> 33:01.170
Dean?

33:02.649 --> 33:03.649
Dean!

33:07.787 --> 33:09.482
Dean. Hey!

33:09.656 --> 33:11.351
Are you okay?

33:12.559 --> 33:14.993
Yeah, you got to stop
asking me that.

33:15.161 --> 33:16.219
I've been calling you.

33:16.396 --> 33:18.159
- Why didn't you, uh...
- He won't talk.

33:18.331 --> 33:20.026
I figured.

33:21.835 --> 33:24.827
He wanted to die,
and I was gonna kill him.

33:25.005 --> 33:26.005
I was.

33:26.139 --> 33:29.006
But then I stopped because
I know we need him to talk.

33:31.044 --> 33:32.204
Dean, listen.

33:32.379 --> 33:34.176
Metatron has Cass.

33:34.648 --> 33:36.343
He's offering up a trade.

33:39.586 --> 33:40.883
We can't trust Metatron.

33:41.054 --> 33:42.612
I know that. Obviously.

33:42.789 --> 33:45.223
But look, this is the first time

33:45.392 --> 33:47.986
we're gonna know for sure
where Metatron is.

33:48.161 --> 33:49.856
Let's take Gadreel to the meet-up,

33:50.030 --> 33:52.624
make the exchange,
and then trap Metatron.

34:04.611 --> 34:05.611
He's late.

34:07.213 --> 34:08.840
Or he's not gonna show.

34:09.014 --> 34:11.040
Of course I'm gonna show.

34:11.217 --> 34:12.616
I was just waiting for you two

34:12.786 --> 34:15.016
to finished setting up
your little trap for me.

34:21.061 --> 34:22.152
Am I hitting my mark?

34:24.664 --> 34:26.859
Well, come on.
Let's go. I'm waiting.

35:02.535 --> 35:04.298
Either of you bring s'mores?

35:04.471 --> 35:08.430
Holy Fire always gives them
a delightful minty aftertaste.

35:10.043 --> 35:12.603
Make a wish, boys.

35:17.350 --> 35:18.408
No, thanks!

35:29.829 --> 35:30.853
Bye-bye.

35:44.644 --> 35:46.441
Well, a deal is a deal.

35:46.613 --> 35:48.046
Why are you doing this?

35:48.214 --> 35:50.774
Because I can.

35:52.185 --> 35:54.415
Because you
and your little brother

35:54.587 --> 35:56.919
and your fine-feathered friend,

35:57.090 --> 35:59.957
and all those secrets
you've got locked away in your bunker

36:00.126 --> 36:01.150
can't stop me.

36:02.262 --> 36:05.129
But I am gonna enjoy
watching you try.

36:06.900 --> 36:08.629
It's gonna be a hell of a show.

36:09.502 --> 36:12.096
I'll see you around, Castiel.

36:12.272 --> 36:14.536
Never forget I gave you a chance.

36:28.354 --> 36:30.686
Somebody want to tell me
what the hell's going on here?

36:30.857 --> 36:32.484
Metatron is trying to play God.

36:32.659 --> 36:33.785
Play God?

36:33.960 --> 36:35.393
Cass, he erased angel warding.

36:35.562 --> 36:39.191
He friggin' blew out Holy Fire.
He is God.

36:39.365 --> 36:41.094
He's powering up
with the angel tablet.

36:41.267 --> 36:43.565
How the hell are
we supposed to stop this guy?

36:43.736 --> 36:46.432
All right, so what if there is
a stairway to heaven?

36:46.606 --> 36:48.198
We find it and get a drop on the guy.

36:48.374 --> 36:51.207
You want to sneak onto the
Death Star, take out the Emperor?

36:51.578 --> 36:53.876
Okay, I'm not sure

36:54.047 --> 36:56.481
what a fictional battle station
in space has to do with this,

36:56.649 --> 36:59.117
but if taking out the emperor
means taking out Metatron,

36:59.285 --> 37:01.185
- I'm on board.
- Wait, did you...

37:01.287 --> 37:04.256
Did you just understand
a Death Star reference?

37:04.424 --> 37:06.654
Yeah, I think so.

37:06.826 --> 37:09.852
But I don't understand
what that has to do with heaven.

37:10.029 --> 37:11.360
It's halfway, I guess.

37:13.333 --> 37:14.561
You sure you're all right?

37:15.435 --> 37:17.960
Yes. Are you?

37:18.872 --> 37:20.840
There's something
different about you.

37:22.342 --> 37:23.639
I'm fine.

37:30.350 --> 37:31.681
What have you done?

37:33.019 --> 37:35.817
- It's a means to an end.
- Damn it, Dean.

37:38.658 --> 37:40.922
Look, you find heaven,
you drop a dime.

37:41.094 --> 37:43.324
Meantime, I got a Knight to kill.

37:46.532 --> 37:50.229
- Be safe out there.
- You, too. Hey, Sam.

37:51.271 --> 37:52.829
You keep an eye on him.

38:16.896 --> 38:18.022
Is the door secure?

38:18.197 --> 38:19.197
Yes.

38:19.198 --> 38:20.995
The way home is safe.

38:22.201 --> 38:23.964
Thank you, Gadreel.

38:24.137 --> 38:26.230
How did your play turn out?

38:28.107 --> 38:31.076
Didn't quite turn out as I'd planned,

38:31.244 --> 38:34.304
but that is why we rewrite.

38:34.480 --> 38:36.380
That was God's problem,
you know.

38:36.549 --> 38:38.210
He published the first draft.

38:39.585 --> 38:44.716
You've gotta... keep at it until
you get all your ducks in a row.

38:49.829 --> 38:53.196
Was the Winchesters grabbing
me part of your plan?

38:55.435 --> 38:57.300
That was a surprise.

38:58.538 --> 39:01.996
But, hey, what writer
doesn't love a good twist?

39:03.810 --> 39:07.712
My job... is to set up
interesting characters

39:07.880 --> 39:09.507
and see where they lead me.

39:10.683 --> 39:14.278
The by-product of having
well-drawn characters is...

39:15.188 --> 39:16.485
...they may surprise you.

39:17.724 --> 39:19.851
But I know something
they don't know.

39:21.027 --> 39:22.619
The ending.

39:22.795 --> 39:25.457
How I get there doesn't matter,

39:25.631 --> 39:28.964
as long as everybody
plays their part.
