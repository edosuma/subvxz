WEBVTT

00:11.720 --> 00:15.160
Tonight, we drive down a sewer.

00:15.160 --> 00:18.400
We power slide across a field.

00:18.400 --> 00:21.400
And some other things as well.
I can't see where I'm going.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.560
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:27.560 --> 00:30.760
Thank you, everybody. Hello!

00:30.760 --> 00:32.200
Hello. Welcome.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.400
Hello. Thank you, thank you.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.440
Now...

00:36.440 --> 00:40.080
what do you suppose
is the slowest means of transport

00:40.080 --> 00:41.600
in this day and age?

00:41.600 --> 00:43.040
Canal boat?

00:43.040 --> 00:44.720
WOMAN: James May.

00:44.720 --> 00:46.000
James May.

00:46.000 --> 00:49.920
Getting a piggyback
from James May, possibly.

00:49.920 --> 00:53.360
Turns out, though,
the answer is air travel,

00:53.360 --> 00:55.720
as Richard Hammond explains.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.000
This is an airport.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.480
It's a place
where you wait around a lot.

01:03.480 --> 01:07.000
But the waiting isn't just
because of delayed planes.

01:09.840 --> 01:11.920
No, the problem
runs deeper than that.

01:11.920 --> 01:15.360
Everything that moves at an airport
just takes an age.

01:15.360 --> 01:19.560
The tug that drags the plane
to the gate crawls like a snail.

01:19.560 --> 01:23.560
The bus that ferries the passengers
to the place is deathly slow.

01:23.560 --> 01:25.360
The catering truck is always late,

01:25.360 --> 01:28.760
the fuel truck just meanders about
with no sense of urgency

01:28.760 --> 01:30.200
and as for that little thing

01:30.200 --> 01:32.600
that drags the luggage around
in a big train,

01:32.600 --> 01:34.040
maybe that's the reason

01:34.040 --> 01:36.920
why you have to wait for a year
at the luggage carousel.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.120
Net result - misery.

01:39.120 --> 01:42.760
In fact, some youngsters who check in
to fly somewhere on a school trip

01:42.760 --> 01:45.920
often die of old age
in the departure lounge.

01:45.920 --> 01:47.880
And that's an actual fact.

01:47.880 --> 01:50.640
Time, then, for Top Gear to step in,

01:50.640 --> 01:54.280
and in the same
we solved the bendy bus issue,

01:54.280 --> 01:58.680
we shall tackle this problem
through the crucible of motor sport.

02:00.480 --> 02:04.800
Let's begin by assembling a selection
of typical airport vehicles.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.280
First up, the aircraft steps.

02:09.280 --> 02:13.360
Never there when you need them.
Hope they can buck their ideas up.

02:13.360 --> 02:16.960
Then we have the thing
that lugs the luggage around,

02:16.960 --> 02:18.680
complete with...luggage.

02:18.680 --> 02:22.600
The fuel tanker,
heavy and full of...

02:22.600 --> 02:23.920
stuff.

02:23.920 --> 02:25.200
Fuel.

02:25.200 --> 02:28.960
Next, the bendy bus that ferries
the passengers around.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.920
We're already
pretty familiar with those.

02:31.920 --> 02:37.560
Ah, the fire engine. Absolutely no
excuse for tardiness for that one.

02:37.560 --> 02:39.000
And the catering truck.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.680
Always late, sometimes better
if it didn't turn up at all.

02:42.680 --> 02:44.560
And finally,

02:44.560 --> 02:47.520
the heaviest beast of all -
the aircraft tug.

02:49.280 --> 02:51.440
So, there we are -

02:51.440 --> 02:55.880
a group of machines that normally
trundle around at a snail's pace.

02:55.880 --> 03:00.640
But just think how much faster
the whole airport experience would be

03:00.640 --> 03:03.440
if we could speed things up.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.120
To show the airport bosses

03:05.120 --> 03:08.000
just what untapped potential
these machines have,

03:08.000 --> 03:09.960
welcome to the inaugural

03:09.960 --> 03:15.080
Top Gear Various Airport Vehicles
Motor Sport Challenge Race...

03:15.080 --> 03:16.680
Challenge.

03:16.680 --> 03:20.240
Our venue for this
ground-breaking event

03:20.240 --> 03:24.600
is London's Heathrow Airport,
just outside London.

03:26.560 --> 03:29.280
Normally it is
a lot busier than this

03:29.280 --> 03:32.440
but the people who run Heathrow
closed it for the day

03:32.440 --> 03:38.080
and they've moved all the jumbos
and, um, terminals off to the side,

03:38.080 --> 03:39.880
out of shot...

03:39.880 --> 03:42.000
They have, that's what they've done.

03:42.000 --> 03:47.200
So, with that taken care of,
all I need now are some drivers.

03:47.200 --> 03:50.800
Sadly, the airport ground staff
just won't cut the mustard.

03:50.800 --> 03:53.640
But guess who I ran into
in Duty Free.

03:53.640 --> 03:56.320
Touring car legend, Tom Chilton.

03:58.440 --> 04:00.840
Touring car legend, Matt Neal.

04:03.080 --> 04:05.200
Touring car legend, Mat Jackson.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.800
Touring car legend, Gordon Shedden.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.120
Touring car legend, Anthony Reid.

04:16.279 --> 04:18.680
And truck racing legend,
Stuart Oliver.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.320
The drivers climbed into
their chosen machines,

04:24.320 --> 04:27.400
leaving me with the fire engine.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.080
I can't reach the switch.

04:31.120 --> 04:32.720
ENGINE STARTS

04:32.720 --> 04:33.920
Yeah!

04:35.200 --> 04:40.200
All of these vehicles have very
different engines and what have you,

04:40.200 --> 04:42.640
and so whichever one wins today

04:42.640 --> 04:45.000
is the vehicle
we will be recommending

04:45.000 --> 04:47.960
all future aircraft vehicles
are based on,

04:47.960 --> 04:50.760
regardless of function or task.

04:50.760 --> 04:54.560
ENGINES REV

04:55.760 --> 04:58.360
This is a pretty serious
scientific experiment,

04:58.360 --> 05:00.640
so I have stressed
to the other drivers

05:00.640 --> 05:02.600
in the strongest possible terms,

05:02.600 --> 05:05.280
absolutely no body contact
whatsoever.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:17.640 --> 05:19.280
We're away!

05:22.040 --> 05:25.040
The catering lorry -
I can't believe how that took off!

05:25.040 --> 05:28.880
'Although the fire truck was
incredibly noisy...'

05:28.880 --> 05:30.120
ENGINE WHINES

05:30.120 --> 05:33.320
'..on paper,
it had got winning potential.'

05:44.360 --> 05:49.840
'On the minus side, however,
it was still a fire truck.'

05:58.360 --> 06:01.200
'Very soon, I was falling back.'

06:05.320 --> 06:09.440
Oh, no! I mean, what good would
this be in an emergency situation

06:09.440 --> 06:13.200
if the bloody catering truck
gets there before the fire engine?!

06:13.200 --> 06:16.120
'And predictably,
with me out of the way,

06:16.120 --> 06:20.240
'the touring car boys were ignoring
my strict no-contact rule.

06:26.560 --> 06:30.840
'If I was to get back in and restore
order, I needed to act fast.'

06:30.840 --> 06:32.920
There, that'll do.

06:32.920 --> 06:35.480
Ha-ha!

06:38.080 --> 06:39.720
Oh! Yep.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.320
I can't see where I'm going.
I can't see.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.520
I wonder what's happened
to the world.

06:44.520 --> 06:46.360
'But the crash diet did the trick.'

06:48.400 --> 06:53.000
I'm back in the race in my
lightweight fire truck superleggera!

06:53.000 --> 06:54.640
Yes!

06:54.640 --> 06:56.040
'Unfortunately,

06:56.040 --> 06:59.640
'the other drivers weren't impressed
with the new track conditions.'

07:11.240 --> 07:13.520
That's lapped the bendy bus!

07:13.520 --> 07:15.920
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

07:21.880 --> 07:27.360
'Several laps into the race
and no clear winner was emerging.'

07:30.040 --> 07:33.360
The stairs in front of me now,
they're an unknown quanti...TY!

07:33.360 --> 07:35.120
Oh, my God!

07:35.120 --> 07:40.200
'So, with great regret, I ordered
the drivers to turn up the wick.'

07:40.200 --> 07:41.720
Maximum revs!

07:49.640 --> 07:51.960
'Pretty soon,
the results started to come,

07:51.960 --> 07:56.680
'with the fuel tender
taking a pretty serious kicking
from the catering truck.'

08:06.600 --> 08:09.960
The fuel lorry is out.

08:11.160 --> 08:12.880
Oh!

08:21.880 --> 08:24.600
'With just two laps to go,

08:24.600 --> 08:28.280
'the 29-tonne tug
and the luggage trolley

08:28.280 --> 08:30.480
'were at the back
in a fight of their own.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.520
'And following
an accidental manoeuvre by me...'

08:35.960 --> 08:39.400
Woah! '..the bendy bus
was now crippled,

08:39.400 --> 08:43.840
'meaning it was now all down to me,
the catering truck and the stairs.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.960
'Correction - make that me
and the catering truck.

08:51.960 --> 08:56.800
'Which, as we entered the final lap,
had suddenly changed tactics.'

09:00.240 --> 09:03.320
Woah! What's he done with that?!

09:03.320 --> 09:05.280
'What he'd done was genius.'

09:15.080 --> 09:19.360
'The lightweight catering truck
shot into the lead.'

09:19.360 --> 09:20.800
Woah!

09:20.800 --> 09:22.440
'But the racing driver,

09:22.440 --> 09:24.720
'being a racing driver,

09:24.720 --> 09:27.000
'had forgotten about
the laws of physics.'

09:30.720 --> 09:33.120
That is the catering truck
out of it.

09:33.120 --> 09:36.680
That is good news indeed. Yeah!

09:40.640 --> 09:42.360
Ahh! There you go!

09:43.560 --> 09:46.200
'So, airports of the world,
take note.'

09:46.200 --> 09:47.640
From now on,

09:47.640 --> 09:51.840
all airport vehicles
will be based on the fire engine,

09:51.840 --> 09:53.360
which will be brilliant

09:53.360 --> 09:55.080
as long as there isn't a fire.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.120
CHEERING

10:02.120 --> 10:03.800
Excellent work.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.560
Excellent science, Doctor.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.240
Excellent science.

10:08.800 --> 10:12.360
More of that. More research, yeah.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.560
Now let's do the news.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.880
Yes, let's. Right... Oh, yes.

10:16.880 --> 10:20.600
Every week, the Daily Mirror
runs a story

10:20.600 --> 10:23.200
saying that we've done
something unspeakable.

10:23.200 --> 10:25.840
You know, we've stolen
all the Army's helicopters

10:25.840 --> 10:29.360
or we've accidentally clubbed an
old lady to death with a baby seal.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.760
This week, OK,

10:30.760 --> 10:33.560
the story they chose
to run with was this.

10:33.560 --> 10:35.160
OK? Here it is.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.720
Big story saying that...

10:37.720 --> 10:41.600
homosexuals are banned from
the Top Gear studio audience.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.040
Now, seriously, honestly,

10:44.040 --> 10:48.240
I've never read such rubbish
in my life, ever. Now, it is true...

10:48.240 --> 10:52.400
LAUGHTER
..that we like an even split
of men and women in the audience,

10:52.400 --> 10:54.640
otherwise it's a bit like
the early days

10:54.640 --> 10:57.960
when we only got the Subaru owners
club, and that's a bit grizzly.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.720
But we do not actually insist

10:59.720 --> 11:03.440
that you sleep with the person
you come to the studio with. No.

11:03.440 --> 11:06.640
I mean, often, you know,
mums come down with their sons

11:06.640 --> 11:08.440
and we're not suggesting that...

11:08.440 --> 11:12.040
You know, that's... No, we're not.
But everybody's welcome. Exactly.

11:12.040 --> 11:16.440
The truth is, we welcome
homosexual couples here. We do.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.920
We particularly like the lesbian
sort. Oh, God!

11:18.920 --> 11:20.600
Oh, no. No, no, no.

11:20.600 --> 11:25.840
I saw a film about lesbians
on the internet once. Oh, God!

11:25.840 --> 11:28.000
LAUGHTER

11:28.000 --> 11:31.800
It looked very interesting.

11:31.800 --> 11:35.840
Now, BMW, OK, have made...they've
made this. It's an M5 CSL, OK?

11:35.840 --> 11:38.680
It's got a carbon fibre roof,

11:38.680 --> 11:42.400
it's got a longer-stroke engine,
5.5 litres, 580 horsepower.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.360
That is 20 seconds a lap faster
round the Nurburgring

11:45.360 --> 11:47.720
than the standard M5.

11:47.720 --> 11:49.680
Wow.
LAUGHTER

11:49.680 --> 11:52.360
I know. The big "wow" is...
Do you know what it is?

11:52.360 --> 11:55.640
They're not going to make it,
and that's weird to me.

11:55.640 --> 11:58.560
Why go to all that trouble
if you're not going to make it?

11:58.560 --> 12:02.280
That's like...sleeping with a woman
when you don't want to have a baby.

12:02.280 --> 12:07.760
No, that doesn't work, does it?
That's the worst metaphor ever.

12:07.760 --> 12:11.440
You're on your own with that!
The real reason I brought this up

12:11.440 --> 12:13.880
are these BMW racing colours,

12:13.880 --> 12:18.160
because you don't see racing
colours any more in motor racing.

12:18.160 --> 12:22.040
You remember the Alitalia colours
and the Martini...

12:22.040 --> 12:25.120
It's a good point, because
these days, you get a white car

12:25.120 --> 12:28.000
and then it just says
something like "Panasonic". Ugh!

12:28.000 --> 12:29.920
Those new teams coming into F1,

12:29.920 --> 12:31.840
they should choose their sponsors

12:31.840 --> 12:35.640
according to which sponsors are going
to give them the best-looking car.

12:35.640 --> 12:38.040
With the Sheffield team
that we talked about,

12:38.040 --> 12:40.880
they could get sponsored by...
well, by a local band.

12:40.880 --> 12:42.320
The Human League!

12:42.320 --> 12:45.280
They could all have helmets
that are shorter on one side!

12:45.280 --> 12:47.120
Because you know Timo Glock.

12:47.120 --> 12:52.320
He was working as a waiter
in a cocktail bar.

12:52.320 --> 12:57.120
They don't want him. They picked
him up, turned him around
and turned him into something new.

12:57.120 --> 13:00.600
Yes, all right,
enough '80s lyrics references!

13:00.600 --> 13:04.400
I know what would make an excellent
sponsor for a motor racing team.

13:04.400 --> 13:08.120
If you say Morrisons,
I'm going to stab you in the heart.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.600
No, I think After Eight mints.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.480
There's that dark green
with a little gold stripe on.

13:13.480 --> 13:15.400
Does... Aston Martin.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.200
Dark green...
They race at Le Mans... Yeah.

13:18.200 --> 13:19.720
..24-hour race.

13:19.720 --> 13:22.480
It would be after eight
in an After eight car!

13:22.480 --> 13:24.960
Make that happen. Do it.

13:24.960 --> 13:29.400
What about Cooper's marmalade?
You could have an orange racing car
but with bits in.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.520
What?

13:30.520 --> 13:32.560
You could have beef Hula Hoops.

13:32.560 --> 13:33.760
Um...

13:33.760 --> 13:35.640
Bovril... Not Bovril. Bisto!

13:35.640 --> 13:40.120
Then you could have that white thing
down the car that could say, "Aah"!

13:40.120 --> 13:44.880
James, you're just naming things
you like and they're all brown!

13:44.880 --> 13:46.480
James May's Formula Brown!

13:46.480 --> 13:49.520
"Look, Church's shoes
is overtaking the cottage pie"!

13:49.520 --> 13:52.960
What would you rather...? Yes,
but what would you rather have -

13:52.960 --> 13:54.680
gravy overtakes pie

13:54.680 --> 13:58.640
or the gone-bust bank overtakes the
Japanese producer of electronics?

13:58.640 --> 14:01.600
He's got a point.
No, I'd want to watch that.

14:01.600 --> 14:06.040
Why have I got a vision of
James May smearing himself
with marmalade?! Oh, my God!

14:06.040 --> 14:07.640
Now, hey.

14:07.640 --> 14:11.240
You know we're living in the most
stupid country in the world?

14:11.240 --> 14:14.320
You have mentioned that...
every week at about this time.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.840
OK, get this, right.

14:15.840 --> 14:18.720
It's the Royal Commission
on Environmental Pollution

14:18.720 --> 14:22.480
is backing a recent call from
the scientific journal Nature, OK,

14:22.480 --> 14:25.720
suggesting that we should turn off
all the streetlights

14:25.720 --> 14:28.240
and drive around in darkness.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.080
Isn't that a bit dangerous? Yes.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.200
They say if you turn the lights off,
it WILL increase accidents,

14:33.200 --> 14:36.960
and presumably deaths
and casualties, by ten per cent,

14:36.960 --> 14:39.040
but they say
it's a price worth paying

14:39.040 --> 14:41.800
as it'll make life better
for nocturnal creatures

14:41.800 --> 14:44.040
like bats and badgers
and Patrick Moore.

14:44.040 --> 14:49.800
They say that too much light
creates dark and shady areas

14:49.800 --> 14:52.120
where criminals can hide.

14:52.120 --> 14:56.760
Are they saying that light creates
more dark and shady places

14:56.760 --> 14:58.520
than, for example, darkness?

14:58.520 --> 15:00.720
What are they talking about?!
There's...

15:00.720 --> 15:04.760
I thought it would be a good idea
to find a picture
of the scientist behind this

15:04.760 --> 15:08.440
so we could put a picture of him up
and we could all laugh at his beard.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.760
It turns out
he doesn't have a beard.

15:10.760 --> 15:13.160
But I think he does have a problem
with light,

15:13.160 --> 15:16.240
because this is the only picture
I could find.

15:16.240 --> 15:18.240
Ahh, what's happened?!

15:18.240 --> 15:21.000
He's a vampire - that's why
he wants to make it dark!

15:21.000 --> 15:23.440
He does.
What do we need to get him?

15:23.440 --> 15:25.280
MAN: Wooden stake. A wooden stake!

15:25.280 --> 15:28.520
We need a wooden stake to drive
through his Pringle jumper,

15:28.520 --> 15:31.080
I think he's wearing.

15:31.080 --> 15:33.200
Hey, listen.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.560
Do you want an Audi A4, OK,

15:35.560 --> 15:39.520
that's much more expensive
and harder to park?

15:39.520 --> 15:42.640
Yes, I do. Good news,
because this week,

15:42.640 --> 15:45.200
we've received news that
there's a new Audi A8.

15:45.200 --> 15:49.520
It's designed by a man
called Mick Dick.

15:49.520 --> 15:50.680
LAUGHTER

15:50.680 --> 15:54.560
I've got... No, no, no,
I've got the bumf here, OK? Um...

15:54.560 --> 15:57.080
Has he anything interesting
to tell us about it?

16:01.480 --> 16:04.480
JEREMY MUMBLES INDISTINCTLY

16:06.800 --> 16:08.160
No.

16:08.160 --> 16:11.520
Well...what does it look like?

16:11.520 --> 16:14.440
No idea.
This is the picture they sent, OK?

16:16.440 --> 16:18.120
It's under a cloth! Yes.

16:18.120 --> 16:20.480
Who's he? Mick Dick.
Oh, that's him! Yeah.

16:20.480 --> 16:25.600
Best friend, as it turns out,
of Billy Willy!

16:25.600 --> 16:27.720
They work for Bob Knob, do they?!

16:27.720 --> 16:29.800
With Roger Todger.

16:29.800 --> 16:34.080
They were going to get it designed
by the Scottish car designer...

16:34.080 --> 16:35.520
Jock Cock!

16:35.520 --> 16:37.240
Actually,

16:37.240 --> 16:39.640
there was something
interesting in here, OK?

16:39.640 --> 16:41.200
There was, genuinely, right?

16:41.200 --> 16:44.560
What Audi has done is they've
outlined what the A8 customer is.

16:44.560 --> 16:47.560
GERMAN ACCENT: And they say...
he is highly affluent

16:47.560 --> 16:52.440
with an average income
of 500,000 a year,

16:52.440 --> 16:53.680
er...

16:53.680 --> 16:56.160
he is 58 years old

16:56.160 --> 16:58.480
er, highly educated,

16:58.480 --> 17:00.760
mostly married.

17:00.760 --> 17:04.800
Mostly married? How?
What does that...
So he's married down to there?

17:04.800 --> 17:06.599
And this bit is separated?

17:06.599 --> 17:09.839
Yeah, it says he's got a few
children still in the household.

17:09.839 --> 17:12.760
What, in the basement?
Yeah, he's a kidnapper as well.

17:12.760 --> 17:16.280
Anyone here who is 58 years old,
on half a million dollars a year

17:16.280 --> 17:21.040
with divorced shins
and some children in the basement?

17:21.040 --> 17:23.520
LAUGHTER

17:23.520 --> 17:27.000
Oh, dear, Mick Dick's cocked up.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.440
He's built a car for someone
who doesn't exist.

17:30.440 --> 17:36.160
Yeah. So let's move on.
You see, it doesn't matter
what sort of a person you are.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.640
There is always a car to suit.

17:38.640 --> 17:43.360
If, for example, you're an air
hostess, you can have an Audi TT.

17:43.360 --> 17:46.640
If you're a Freemason,
hm, you can have a Lexus.

17:46.640 --> 17:49.480
If you have huge ears
with hair sprouting out of them,

17:49.480 --> 17:52.840
you can have a Peugeot 3008.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.120
LAUGHTER

17:54.120 --> 17:56.120
But...what if you're mad?

17:56.120 --> 18:01.520
What if you can't walk past a window
without being overcome with
an uncontrollable need to lick it?

18:03.560 --> 18:07.920
There's never been a car
to suit you...until now.

18:09.880 --> 18:14.000
This is no ordinary BMW X5.

18:14.000 --> 18:18.200
This is an S&M X5.

18:18.200 --> 18:21.080
What they've done is taken
the standard car

18:21.080 --> 18:28.760
and inserted under the bonnet
a 555 horsepower, 4.4 litre
twin-turbo-charged V8.

18:28.760 --> 18:34.040
The results are as dramatic
as putting a furious weasel

18:34.040 --> 18:35.960
in your underpants.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.520
Gallon of fuel gone there.

18:44.520 --> 18:47.800
There's another one gone.
And another.

18:47.800 --> 18:51.440
This car would be less annoying
to eco-mentalists

18:51.440 --> 18:54.040
if its engine ran on sliced dolphin.

18:55.800 --> 19:03.200
Still, it produces
more power and more torque
than a Ferrari 430 Scuderia.

19:07.800 --> 19:11.080
So, despite the enormous weight,
we're told that in a drag race,

19:11.080 --> 19:15.400
it should be able to make mincemeat
out of most sports cars.

19:21.360 --> 19:23.360
Go!

19:25.680 --> 19:31.040
Yep. This is a five-litre,
super-charged sports car.

19:31.040 --> 19:33.880
HE LAUGHS
And it's winning.

19:33.880 --> 19:36.200
Yeah, there you go - look.
There's Usain Bolt.

19:36.200 --> 19:41.200
Thrashing John Prescott here,
contrary to the information
we received.

19:44.400 --> 19:48.200
We weren't expecting that. We looked
up some figures in the office

19:48.200 --> 19:51.920
and they suggested that this
would win and now it hasn't.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.440
That's a bit embarrassing.

19:55.480 --> 19:57.880
The handling is equally surprising.

19:57.880 --> 20:00.320
But in a good way.

20:09.640 --> 20:14.920
It is remarkable that here I am
four miles high in the sky

20:14.920 --> 20:19.080
driving a car that weighs slightly
more than the centre of the earth.

20:19.080 --> 20:21.560
And it's fine.
It's better than fine.

20:21.560 --> 20:25.440
It's not an M5, but for something
like this, it's amazing.

20:27.240 --> 20:30.000
And of course, it's all great,

20:30.000 --> 20:34.480
but in a big 4x4 school bus,
what's the point?

20:34.480 --> 20:41.360
I don't know what the world record
is for the most amount of sick
to come out of a child,

20:41.360 --> 20:46.560
but I reckon if you put
a nine-year-old in the back of
one of these and drove like this...

20:50.040 --> 20:52.240
..he could beat it.

20:57.720 --> 21:03.000
And look at this. This tells you how
much torque is going to each wheel

21:03.000 --> 21:05.240
at any given moment.

21:05.240 --> 21:08.400
Can you imagine bringing that up
on a first date?

21:08.400 --> 21:11.200
Have you seen this, my dear?
Look at that.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.520
I reckon you'd be in there. Mm-mm.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.760
This, then, is a silly car.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.520
And also, it's not very good.

21:19.520 --> 21:22.880
The seats are hard and unsupportive.

21:22.880 --> 21:27.480
The ride on normal roads is
very uncomfortable, if I'm honest.

21:27.480 --> 21:32.920
And I don't know about you, but
I find this interior rather boring,
apart from that, obviously -

21:32.920 --> 21:34.680
the torque thing.

21:34.680 --> 21:36.880
It's like sitting in someone's ear.

21:36.880 --> 21:42.920
What's more, because it's fast, it
has fat tyres and firm suspension.

21:42.920 --> 21:45.520
And that's created another problem.

21:47.480 --> 21:54.280
What they've done is built a car
that can sort of go off-road
and then converted it so that now

21:54.280 --> 21:55.960
it can't any more.

21:55.960 --> 22:01.600
Still, if you want one,
get your nurse to find you a crayon

22:01.600 --> 22:05.080
and write out a cheque for Â£76,000.

22:07.880 --> 22:11.240
Or, if you don't understand
how crayons work,

22:11.240 --> 22:15.000
you could spend even more
on this rather ugly Audi.

22:18.560 --> 22:22.680
On the face of it, this Q7
appears to be quite sensible.

22:22.680 --> 22:27.440
Unlike the X5, it comes
with seven seats which move about

22:27.440 --> 22:29.480
to suit your every need.

22:29.480 --> 22:31.720
And under the bonnet,
there's a diesel engine.

22:31.720 --> 22:37.200
Sadly, however, it's not a diesel
engine that makes any sense at all.

22:39.760 --> 22:46.880
You see, it's a six-litre
twin-turbo-charged V12 diesel.

22:46.880 --> 22:52.160
Now, I'm sorry, but the whole point
of buying a diesel engine car
is to save money,

22:52.160 --> 22:57.840
so having a twin-turbo V12 diesel
is like turning your central heating
off at home

22:57.840 --> 23:01.560
and then keeping warm
by burning Rembrandts.

23:01.560 --> 23:05.280
Still, at least you get
a lot of torques.

23:05.280 --> 23:09.840
738 of them, in fact.

23:09.840 --> 23:13.440
That's 200 more than you get
from a Zonda R.

23:15.200 --> 23:19.480
Nought to 60
takes five and a half seconds.

23:19.480 --> 23:23.520
Top speed is limited
to 155 miles an hour.

23:24.880 --> 23:29.960
And it stops because it's got
ceramic brakes. In a diesel!

23:29.960 --> 23:33.440
But it's the go, really.
That's the astonishing bit.

23:36.400 --> 23:41.480
I'm not kidding. This car could
bump-start a jumbo jet.

23:41.480 --> 23:44.000
But only if you fit it
with a towbar,

23:44.000 --> 23:47.160
which is an Â£830 option.

23:47.160 --> 23:53.240
I don't know about you,
but that seems a bit steep
on a car which costs Â£96,000.

23:57.480 --> 24:02.080
Apart from the fact that these cars,
with their mighty engines,

24:02.080 --> 24:05.240
have brought sunshine
where before there was rain,

24:05.240 --> 24:08.800
they are completely bonkers
and pointless.

24:08.800 --> 24:14.320
However, happily, there is
a third way of wasting your money.

24:21.440 --> 24:26.480
This new Range Rover is heavier
than the Audi and the BMW.

24:26.480 --> 24:29.240
And slower. And thirstier.

24:29.240 --> 24:32.760
And at Â£80,000,
it's not exactly cheap either.

24:32.760 --> 24:35.120
But unlike its German rivals,

24:35.120 --> 24:38.760
it does still work
when it's off-road.

24:48.520 --> 24:52.360
All this computer gubbins down here
means that you can keep going

24:52.360 --> 24:55.760
when nature would rather you turned
round and went home.

24:55.760 --> 24:59.000
Bit like now, really.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.960
And there's another thing.

25:00.960 --> 25:05.400
The buttons and switches
in the BMW and the Audi are just
taken out of normal saloon cars.

25:05.400 --> 25:10.760
In the Range Rover,
they're big and chunky so you can
use them while wearing gloves.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.800
Little things.

25:17.480 --> 25:22.920
What's more, the Range Rover
is more majestic that the Germans.
More dignified.

25:22.920 --> 25:27.920
It's way more comfortable too,
and some of the toys that can be
specified these days

25:27.920 --> 25:31.400
are just unbelievable.

25:37.200 --> 25:40.040
There are five cameras
all around the car

25:40.040 --> 25:42.880
and you can call up the images
they're taking on the screen here.

25:42.880 --> 25:44.120
There they are.

25:44.120 --> 25:46.280
Then you choose which ones
you want to enlarge.

25:46.280 --> 25:50.360
So I'll take that one looking front
left and that one looking backwards.

25:50.360 --> 25:53.360
Push enlarge. There we are.

25:53.360 --> 25:56.680
We're coming up to the Hammerhead,
going the wrong way.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.240
Let's have the forward view there.

25:59.240 --> 26:03.520
Now, let's see how well I clip
the apex on that.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.360
Oh, yes! Looking good.

26:05.360 --> 26:08.880
There it is. Over the red and white
lines. Now, here we go.

26:08.880 --> 26:12.720
Let's switch to the rear camera
as we power down the main straight.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.920
You know what?

26:16.920 --> 26:20.600
We don't really need a film crew
or a director to make Top Gear
any more.

26:20.600 --> 26:23.120
In fact, I think I'm going to run
them down.

26:23.120 --> 26:25.040
Yes, I am. Run!

26:25.040 --> 26:27.920
This has become a snuff movie.

26:27.920 --> 26:33.680
Before you write in to complain, I
should explain that what I'm doing
now is saving your licence fee

26:33.680 --> 26:35.120
on expensive crew.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.600
We don't need them.
I can do it all here myself.

26:41.600 --> 26:45.160
Come here! You're just
an expensive waste of time there.

26:45.160 --> 26:46.760
We don't need you any more!

26:52.600 --> 26:58.160
Mind you, some of the features on
this new model are not so good.

26:58.160 --> 27:04.920
These days, the grille is way to
Cheshire and even the gills now have
their own annoying styling details.

27:08.840 --> 27:14.560
But the biggest problem, in this
version at least, is the engine.

27:14.560 --> 27:20.520
In essence, it's the same five-litre
super-charged V8 that you get
in a Jag these days,

27:20.520 --> 27:26.840
and that's jolly nice if you live in
Houston or Abu Dhabi or somewhere
else where petrol is cheap.

27:26.840 --> 27:29.600
But here,

27:29.600 --> 27:33.960
hmm, I'm the world's biggest
Range Rover fan,

27:33.960 --> 27:39.040
but I have to admit
that this engine in Britain

27:39.040 --> 27:41.240
makes no sense at all.

27:44.680 --> 27:47.960
I'd buy the diesel-engined
Range Rover in a heartbeat,

27:47.960 --> 27:51.960
but with a massive petrol engine,
this is like the other cars here.

27:55.440 --> 27:58.880
Really rather ridiculous.

28:03.760 --> 28:06.120
APPLAUSE

28:07.240 --> 28:09.480
I hate to say it,
but I agree with you.

28:09.480 --> 28:12.000
You do? I do. About what?

28:12.000 --> 28:15.920
Because the diesel Range Rover
is just fabulous

28:15.920 --> 28:18.640
because, well, it's just like
the petrol Ranger,

28:18.640 --> 28:21.440
but the diesel makes a better noise.
It does. Incredibly.

28:21.440 --> 28:25.920
And you only have to stop
and fill it up every 500 miles,
rather than every 500 yards.

28:25.920 --> 28:29.040
No question. You see, the thing is,
if you get the diesel,

28:29.040 --> 28:32.720
you still get that amazing screen
that allows you to make movies.

28:32.720 --> 28:35.760
But there's so much more to it
than that.

28:35.760 --> 28:41.640
For obvious reasons, you can't watch
a DVD while you're driving along,
for example, OK?

28:41.640 --> 28:46.520
But if we look at this, OK? The
passenger here is looking at a DVD.

28:46.520 --> 28:48.680
Yes? You can see that.

28:48.680 --> 28:51.800
But if we look at the screen
from where I'm sitting,

28:51.800 --> 28:56.200
it's satellite navigation.
Same screen - look at this.
I see sat nav.

28:56.200 --> 29:00.560
Where the passenger is sitting,
they can see a DVD.

29:00.560 --> 29:03.400
On the same screen!
Come back again, look.

29:03.400 --> 29:09.560
Sat nav. This is the most amazing
thing I've ever seen in my life.

29:09.560 --> 29:14.320
And it doesn't end there, either,
does it? Those cameras you were
talking about... No, no, no.

29:14.320 --> 29:17.200
I'd forgotten.
Look at this. You can see OK.

29:17.200 --> 29:19.760
We zoom in, zoom in like this.

29:19.760 --> 29:25.280
And then you can move it up...
Oh, you can actually move
the camera! Look at that.

29:25.280 --> 29:28.880
That's brilliant!

29:28.880 --> 29:31.400
Who invented that?

29:31.400 --> 29:34.240
APPLAUSE

29:34.240 --> 29:37.240
Yes! That is just genius.

29:37.240 --> 29:40.480
Would you like to go round the back?
Sorry, mate?

29:40.480 --> 29:43.880
Oh, the... Yes! The cameras
at the back. Look at the back.

29:43.880 --> 29:48.800
Zoom in. In, in. No, no, no, no, no!
Now look what you've done.

29:48.800 --> 29:52.760
I'm sorry. It's disgusting. Sorry.

29:52.760 --> 29:54.960
APPLAUSE

29:54.960 --> 29:58.560
Now, look...
That's a disappointment.

29:58.560 --> 30:01.200
If you two could just stop mucking
around for a minute,

30:01.200 --> 30:04.160
I've got a quite a serious point
to make over here.

30:04.160 --> 30:07.760
If you want to spend more money on
your Range Rover, for Pete's sake,

30:07.760 --> 30:10.920
don't spend it trying to make it
go faster because you'll ruin it.

30:10.920 --> 30:14.600
Instead, why not spend it on
making it a bit more luxurious?

30:14.600 --> 30:19.240
Now, a company called Overfinch
has collaborated with
Holland & Holland,

30:19.240 --> 30:24.280
the gun-makers, to produce this.
Yeah, now, it's still a Range Rover,

30:24.280 --> 30:28.760
so inside you've got
the clever amazing witchcraft screen
and everything, but a bit more.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.600
So, for instance, this wood here,

30:30.600 --> 30:33.160
you've got this marquetry work
in it. Lovely.

30:33.160 --> 30:35.360
And these panels on
the steering wheel.

30:35.360 --> 30:39.560
You can have these custom-engraved
to match your own shotguns.

30:39.560 --> 30:45.080
Obviously!
The leather is the stuff they use on
the very finest business jets.

30:45.080 --> 30:49.040
And in the back, you do lose a seat,
but instead you get this piece
of furniture

30:49.040 --> 30:52.520
from the bedroom of Louis XIV.
More exquisite marquetry.

30:52.520 --> 30:55.120
In here
there is some nice cut glass.

30:55.120 --> 30:59.080
And down here,
there is a refrigerator,

30:59.080 --> 31:02.960
and it is a refrigerator, not merely
a slightly chilly cubbyhole.

31:02.960 --> 31:08.960
The cost of all this is Â£139,000.

31:08.960 --> 31:10.480
AUDIENCE MURMUR

31:10.480 --> 31:12.520
Now, that is a lot of money,

31:12.520 --> 31:17.880
but then this car does come
with the best optional extra
ever fitted to any car

31:17.880 --> 31:22.240
in the whole of human history,
I think I'm right in saying.
Yeah, yeah. You're right.

31:22.240 --> 31:24.200
OK, it's this chest
here in the back.

31:24.200 --> 31:29.200
In this drawer here we find, OK,
there is space for your gun.

31:29.200 --> 31:35.040
This particular gun in this one,
they actually cost more than
the car does.

31:35.040 --> 31:37.240
RIPPLE OF LAUGHTER
No, seriously.

31:37.240 --> 31:39.560
OK, so that's the guns, right,
on this side.

31:39.560 --> 31:42.520
And what goes with guns?
You're right - drink.

31:42.520 --> 31:45.400
And so...
LAUGHTER

31:45.400 --> 31:49.960
..in here we find the glasses,
the vodka, the whisky, obviously,

31:49.960 --> 31:55.800
the champagne - Pol Roger -
is in the fridge in the car itself.
And here is the really amazing bit.

31:55.800 --> 32:00.120
This is what's called
a self-replenishing drinks cabinet.

32:00.120 --> 32:04.800
For the first year you own the car,
when your drink supplies
are getting low,

32:04.800 --> 32:08.560
they come round
and top them up free of charge.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.720
Wow! Wow.

32:10.720 --> 32:15.160
Do I have to buy the car,
or can I just have the
self-replenishing drinks cabinet?

32:15.160 --> 32:17.400
I'll tell you what,
if I bought this car,

32:17.400 --> 32:22.280
the diesel in the tank after
one year would be exactly the same
as it was when it came.

32:22.280 --> 32:28.000
It would still be in the same field.
I tried drinking the diesel, but then
the man arrived with more champagne.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.880
I just want one of those. No, it is.
I mean, really and truthfully,

32:30.880 --> 32:33.800
this is the car to buy
if you are sensible.

32:33.800 --> 32:37.360
Or if you're a drunk!

32:37.360 --> 32:44.080
But if you are insane, you will
doubtless now want to know how fast
the BMW S&M X whatever it is

32:44.080 --> 32:46.960
and the Audi V12 diesel
go round our track,

32:46.960 --> 32:51.840
and that, of course, means handing
them over to our tame racing driver.

32:51.840 --> 32:55.480
Some say that the drinks cabinet
in his car

32:55.480 --> 32:58.920
contains 14 different types
of custard.

32:58.920 --> 33:00.880
LAUGHTER

33:00.880 --> 33:04.240
And while he has been known to leave
his house in a bit of a hurry,

33:04.240 --> 33:07.320
he's never once hit a fire hydrant.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.760
LAUGHTER

33:09.760 --> 33:12.240
All we know, he's called the Stig!

33:13.320 --> 33:16.960
And they're off, lumbering
down to the first corner

33:16.960 --> 33:18.720
like two fat rhinos in trainers.

33:18.720 --> 33:22.160
Beginning to forget what our tracks
looks like in the dry.

33:22.160 --> 33:24.080
Still, at least these silly cars

33:24.080 --> 33:26.440
have four-wheel drive
to help them along.

33:26.440 --> 33:28.520
Oh, dear,
that's not very interesting

33:28.520 --> 33:29.760
as they go round the first corner.

33:29.760 --> 33:33.440
MUSIC: "Any Old Iron"
by Peter Sellers

33:33.440 --> 33:36.000
Oh, dear. Still enjoying the sound

33:36.000 --> 33:37.880
of Barbara Windsor's wedding.

33:37.880 --> 33:42.440
Audi, there - look at it getting
all out of shape in Chicago.

33:42.440 --> 33:44.840
And now he's heading down
to the Hammerhead.

33:44.840 --> 33:47.320
Triggered the hazards
under heavy breaking.

33:47.320 --> 33:49.200
That Q7 is really not happy.

33:49.200 --> 33:52.040
X5, a little more composed.

33:52.040 --> 33:54.600
Although if you
really wanted composed,

33:54.600 --> 33:56.520
obviously you'd be better off

33:56.520 --> 33:58.960
in the M5 Saloon.

34:00.960 --> 34:05.240
Into Follow Through, a chance
for them to use their big power

34:05.240 --> 34:07.480
to give the laws of physics
a bloody nose.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.440
Thundering past the tyres.

34:09.440 --> 34:13.120
Obviously, now, two corners left.
Audi still flashing away.

34:13.120 --> 34:15.199
BMW getting sideways, there.

34:15.199 --> 34:17.120
Just Gambon left.

34:17.120 --> 34:21.480
Here it comes. BMW veering sideways.
Steady on, Stig!

34:21.480 --> 34:24.080
And across the line!
Well, here we are. Here we are.

34:24.080 --> 34:27.000
APPLAUSE

34:27.000 --> 34:31.159
Stand by to receive the two most
not interesting facts

34:31.159 --> 34:34.159
in the history
of British television.

34:34.159 --> 34:39.520
The Audi Q7 V12 Diesel did it
in 1.33.3. So that's down there.

34:39.520 --> 34:45.440
And the BMW X5 M did it in 1.28.2.

34:45.440 --> 34:47.480
So, there we are. Not interesting.

34:47.480 --> 34:52.719
Uh, and now, it is time to put
a star in our reasonably priced car.

34:52.719 --> 34:56.960
My guest tonight is best known
for his Cockney gangster movies,

34:56.960 --> 35:00.240
such as Snatch and RocknRolla

35:00.240 --> 35:04.200
and Lock and Stock
and Two Smoking Barrels.

35:04.200 --> 35:10.680
So, everybody, open your mince pies,
put your Bobby Sands together,

35:10.680 --> 35:14.800
and let's have a rousing round
of sores...paws...

35:14.800 --> 35:19.760
sores...running, pustulating sores
for Guy Ritchie!

35:19.760 --> 35:23.600
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

35:23.600 --> 35:26.160
Guy, how are you?

35:26.160 --> 35:30.400
Hello, Mr Clarkson, how are you set?
Very well. How are you? Have a seat.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.240
Look at that moment!

35:32.240 --> 35:36.440
Thank you very much!
That is a big welcome.

35:36.440 --> 35:39.680
Now, I was fascinated when
you arrived here this morning.

35:39.680 --> 35:43.600
A lot of guests say the same thing.
Is it possible to turn the car over?

35:43.600 --> 35:47.240
Because they need reassuring that,
no, it isn't.

35:47.240 --> 35:49.960
And then Guy said,
"No, because I really want to."

35:49.960 --> 35:51.880
Well, I had a go.

35:51.880 --> 35:55.280
Would anybody like to see
some of Guy's practices? OK?

35:55.280 --> 35:56.720
AUDIENCE: Yes!

35:56.720 --> 36:01.440
Just early on, this is Guy
practising for his lap.

36:01.440 --> 36:04.800
Here we go. You've still got
the Stig in the car here.

36:04.800 --> 36:08.800
So let's... Look how wet that is!

36:08.800 --> 36:10.440
Wow! That's unbelievable.

36:12.080 --> 36:14.840
HE SHOUTS AND WOOPS

36:14.840 --> 36:18.400
Look at that! We can now
plant crops there after that.

36:18.400 --> 36:20.440
LAUGHTER

36:20.440 --> 36:23.680
Now, obviously - I'm sorry about
this - I'm sure a lot of people

36:23.680 --> 36:26.720
are going to expect a lot
of tittle-tattle about Madonna.

36:26.720 --> 36:29.520
Can I just say,
this isn't Loose Women.

36:29.520 --> 36:32.000
So there'll be none of that.
This is Top Gear.

36:32.000 --> 36:36.120
And I'm more interested
in your love of winching.
LAUGHTER

36:36.120 --> 36:39.640
No, I'm not kidding, OK? You like...
What's it called, Off-Green Laning?

36:39.640 --> 36:43.760
Off-roading? Green Laning
and a bit of winching.
There's nothing like a good winch.

36:43.760 --> 36:47.800
As you know, it's a thing.
It's quite a nerdy undertaking.

36:47.800 --> 36:50.800
No, there is. There are people
who deliberately get stuck.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.800
LAUGHTER

36:52.800 --> 36:55.840
Don't tell me you're one of those.
You winch yourself...?

36:55.840 --> 37:00.480
If you're into winching, you get
stuck. And you get out
and winch yourself out?

37:00.480 --> 37:04.800
If you don't get stuck,
you can't winch. So you
deliberately look to get stuck.

37:04.800 --> 37:07.960
I find that fascinating! What's
the big appeal of winching a car?

37:07.960 --> 37:12.120
It doesn't make any sense. Why
should you want to get a car stuck
and then get it out?

37:12.120 --> 37:13.560
But it's a lot of fun!

37:13.560 --> 37:15.600
LAUGHTER

37:15.600 --> 37:19.560
I can't believe I'm talking so much
about winching!

37:19.560 --> 37:23.240
Now, what do you drive?
Actually, I know what you drive.
You drive a van!

37:23.240 --> 37:26.880
I got a van. Why have you got
a van? I love vans.
I used to be a van driver.

37:26.880 --> 37:29.600
Ritchie's Removals, it was.
LAUGHTER

37:29.600 --> 37:33.720
I wasn't good at Ritchie's Removals.
It didn't work.
Particularly as a business.

37:33.720 --> 37:39.200
We'd been under a few low bridges
and taken a few Â£1,000 tables out
as we went under the low bridges.

37:39.200 --> 37:43.560
How do you explain that to
the poor unfortunate souls waiting
at home for their...?

37:43.560 --> 37:46.840
You have to be very creative.
Hence, I became a film-maker.

37:46.840 --> 37:49.120
But you maintained the love of vans.

37:49.120 --> 37:52.440
I love a van, yeah. And you
now have a Mercedes Sprinter.

37:52.440 --> 37:54.960
Yes, I do. Is it just a normal van?

37:54.960 --> 37:59.720
No, it's been kitted out a bit in
the back. We've got two 42-inch
screens in the back of it.

37:59.720 --> 38:02.240
And it's, uh...cushdy.

38:02.240 --> 38:03.800
LAUGHTER

38:03.800 --> 38:07.600
It's pretty comfy. I mean,
you just get so much bang
for you buck with a van.

38:07.600 --> 38:10.600
How much is a Rolls-Royce Phantom?
Â£250,000.

38:10.600 --> 38:14.880
OK. This was 20 grand. We got it
second-hand. We spent 40 grand
in the back. 60 grand.

38:14.880 --> 38:19.200
I can tell you, it's a lot more
comfortable than a Phantom.
Really? Yeah.

38:19.200 --> 38:24.360
Have you done the outside? The
A-Team thing with the big wheels...?
No, it looks like a builder's van.

38:24.360 --> 38:27.600
"No tools are left in this
overnight", written on the back.

38:27.600 --> 38:30.680
There's lots of tools
left in it overnight.

38:30.680 --> 38:33.600
Ha ha! Oh! Um...

38:33.600 --> 38:38.160
So what do you drive
when you're not driving your van?
I've got the Range Rover outside.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.440
Yeah. Q7. Got an Audi Q7.

38:40.440 --> 38:43.960
Don't like that? I've got to tell
you, everyone loves that.

38:43.960 --> 38:47.680
Well, except me. OK.
What do you know about cars, anyway?

38:47.680 --> 38:49.480
Not much, actually.

38:49.480 --> 38:52.480
I live on a bicycle. That's the
irony. I live in central London

38:52.480 --> 38:56.240
and probably 90% of my travelling
is done on a bicycle.

38:56.240 --> 38:59.640
I love bicycles. I shouldn't imagine
you like bicycles very much.

38:59.640 --> 39:03.840
I'm not... You'd look good
on a bicycle! No, I wouldn't.
A Penny Farthing, maybe.

39:03.840 --> 39:09.360
I was being sarcastic, actually.
I nearly tried to kill a Frenchman
on a bicycle the other day.

39:09.360 --> 39:13.320
He'd got so much rain
on his spectacles, he couldn't
see where he was going.

39:13.320 --> 39:15.680
Then he banged on my car.
Well, that was it.

39:15.680 --> 39:19.960
How did you know he was French?
FRENCH ACCENT: Because he was
speaking like an idiot,

39:19.960 --> 39:21.560
that is how I knew he was French!

39:21.560 --> 39:22.800
LAUGHTER

39:22.800 --> 39:26.920
Now, you've got no cars, obviously,
in your new movie, Sherlock Holmes.

39:26.920 --> 39:31.280
Tell us a bit about it.
I wanted to do a bigger movie
than any movie I've done before.

39:31.280 --> 39:34.520
Um, and it seemed like a natural
segue from going from, sort of,

39:34.520 --> 39:38.560
smaller British gangster
kind of things to doing something
kind of big-ish.

39:38.560 --> 39:42.400
But I wanted to
keep the identity English
and there is no greater icon,

39:42.400 --> 39:44.280
I suppose, than Sherlock Holmes.

39:44.280 --> 39:47.640
But you've got Robert Downey Jr.
as Sherlock.

39:47.640 --> 39:50.320
He's got a very good
British accent. Has he?

39:50.320 --> 39:53.120
We've got a clip.
Let's have a look. Very good.

39:53.120 --> 39:56.040
I have a request.
There's someone I want to see.

39:58.200 --> 39:59.960
Sherlock Holmes.

40:01.640 --> 40:06.000
You and I are bound together
on a journey that will
twist the very fabric of nature.

40:06.000 --> 40:07.480
Allow me to enlighten you.

40:07.480 --> 40:10.760
Tomorrow, the world as you know it
will end.

40:10.760 --> 40:14.520
Well, there isn't any time
to waste, then, is there?

40:18.680 --> 40:24.400
It does make a considerable
difference to me having someone with
me on whom I can thoroughly rely on.

40:24.400 --> 40:26.600
It's nice to see you, Watson.

40:26.600 --> 40:31.080
Oh, yes! That is big budget!
APPLAUSE

40:31.080 --> 40:35.880
Is that CGI? Some of it.
That's a big budget thing
going on right there.

40:35.880 --> 40:38.400
I see what you mean
about his accent.

40:38.400 --> 40:42.880
You can see we had deeper
pockets on this one.
When's that coming out?

40:42.880 --> 40:45.640
Boxing Day in the UK, Christmas Day
everywhere else.

40:45.640 --> 40:50.440
Why isn't it out on Christmas Day
here? Everyone's stuffing
their face with turkey in the UK.

40:50.440 --> 40:54.000
Um, so these days,
you're a publican.

40:54.000 --> 40:57.600
I have a pub. You have a pub in...?

40:57.600 --> 41:01.360
Mayfair. Actually,
I have to tell everyone a story.
Do you mind? Please!

41:01.360 --> 41:04.400
This is back in the Fulham days.
I used to go to this place.

41:04.400 --> 41:09.200
On the Wandsworth Bridge Road, OK?
Get there before ten,
guaranteed lock-in.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.960
Then one day, a new manager
started at this place.

41:11.960 --> 41:15.000
A new manager, no more lock-ins.
"Out. Get lost."

41:15.000 --> 41:18.240
20 years later, I was walking down
the Fulham Road and I ran into

41:18.240 --> 41:21.480
the original barman, now a security
guard outside a hospital.

41:21.480 --> 41:25.480
So I said, "What happened to that
bolshie bastard that came
and took over you?"

41:25.480 --> 41:28.600
He said, "I tell you what happened
to him. He married Madonna."

41:28.600 --> 41:33.560
You stopped us having...
You stopped us having...
APPLAUSE AND LAUGHTER

41:33.560 --> 41:36.960
I been dying to get that off...
Joe's Brasserie.

41:36.960 --> 41:39.240
Did you come and work
as manager there?

41:39.240 --> 41:43.560
It was either me or Sean Penn,
and I don't think Sean Penn
worked in Joe's Brasserie.

41:43.560 --> 41:44.760
LAUGHTER

41:44.760 --> 41:47.680
Now, obviously you came down here
to do your lap.

41:47.680 --> 41:50.720
We've already established -
quite wet.

41:50.720 --> 41:56.640
I mean, the wettest we've ever had.
but nevertheless,
who would like to see Guy's lap?

41:56.640 --> 41:59.320
AUDIENCE: Yes!
Right, Guy, let's have a look.

42:00.560 --> 42:01.720
Soaking wet.

42:01.720 --> 42:05.240
And you can't cut the corners -
this is the important thing.

42:05.240 --> 42:08.920
Oh, come on, son! Wow!

42:08.920 --> 42:11.920
OK, there's the first corner.

42:11.920 --> 42:15.440
No suicidal tendencies into it.

42:15.440 --> 42:17.640
But plenty coming out.

42:17.640 --> 42:19.840
That's quite poo, actually.

42:19.840 --> 42:21.320
LAUGHTER

42:21.320 --> 42:24.280
Off the road a bit, there.

42:24.280 --> 42:27.560
That's looking very neat and tidy.
That's good. That's good.

42:27.560 --> 42:31.080
This is raining, lads, by the way.
I don't know if anyone noticed.

42:31.080 --> 42:33.080
It's quite an unforeseeable thing.

42:33.080 --> 42:36.640
The water's streaming down
the windows! Hammerhead...

42:36.640 --> 42:39.800
Did they put cones out for you
today? No, they didn't bother.

42:39.800 --> 42:43.880
Only last week we had that for Chris
Evans. Just Radio 2 DJs get that.

42:43.880 --> 42:46.240
Again, that looks neat
and tidy and good.

42:46.240 --> 42:49.000
I got to tell you,
this is not easy, chaps.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.840
Now, this is... That's
the Follow Through. Nicely done.

42:53.840 --> 42:57.280
Now, I'm into fourth about now.

43:01.040 --> 43:03.080
Second to last corner,
can't cut that.

43:03.080 --> 43:07.120
Not going to be good.
No, you kissed the apex,
which is exactly right.

43:07.120 --> 43:09.760
Can't touch the grass here...

43:09.760 --> 43:13.080
Oh! You have touched it there
and across the line!

43:13.080 --> 43:15.520
APPLAUSE

43:15.520 --> 43:16.960
Now, that looked good.

43:16.960 --> 43:21.200
That looked good,
because it didn't look as mad
as the practice stuff.

43:23.920 --> 43:25.760
You're leaning forwards.

43:25.760 --> 43:30.000
What does that mean? It's a sign.
Every week, everybody comes on

43:30.000 --> 43:34.120
and and they've been really relaxed
and it gets to the time.
"I'm not bothered."

43:34.120 --> 43:36.120
MIMICS SQUEAKING CHAIR

43:36.120 --> 43:40.880
Well, I shouldn't be bothered,
because I know I did
a pretty appalling performance.

43:40.880 --> 43:42.200
No...

43:42.200 --> 43:43.840
Yes. But...

43:43.840 --> 43:47.680
But the thing is,
the conditions were dreadful.

43:47.680 --> 43:52.080
No question about that. No idea
how fast you'd have gone on the dry,
but I can tell you,

43:52.080 --> 43:54.240
Guy Ritchie, in the wet,
you did it in

43:54.240 --> 43:58.360
1.52.5.

43:58.360 --> 44:01.560
Which means...
I'll give you a very wet.
APPLAUSE

44:01.560 --> 44:04.040
..you go... Oh, that's bad.

44:04.040 --> 44:05.800
Oh!

44:05.800 --> 44:10.000
..between Tom Jones
and Helen Mirren.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.560
Not bad(!)
LAUGHTER

44:13.560 --> 44:16.120
So, how many cars
did you go through doing that?

44:16.120 --> 44:19.080
I went through four cars today.
Four? Yep. Four tyres.

44:19.080 --> 44:21.360
Punctures? And a gearbox.

44:21.360 --> 44:24.160
And a gearbox? Yeah.

44:24.160 --> 44:25.720
That is a new record!

44:25.720 --> 44:29.640
A record! Ladies and gentlemen,
Guy Ritchie! Thank you very much.

44:29.640 --> 44:31.520
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

44:41.280 --> 44:43.560
Bad news! Bad news!

44:43.560 --> 44:46.840
We've had another letter from
Mr Needham. I shall read it out.

44:46.840 --> 44:51.840
"Dear so-called Top Gear. Last year,
I asked if you had forgotten
how to do normal road tests

44:51.840 --> 44:57.320
"on your so-called television show
and you responded with an idiotic
feature in which a Ford Fiesta

44:57.320 --> 45:03.240
"was driven at high speed through a
shopping centre and then off a Royal
Marines landing craft, into the sea."

45:03.240 --> 45:05.560
It was, actually.
Well done, Jeremy(!)

45:05.560 --> 45:09.120
"So I ask again. Will you please do
a normal test in which the concerns

45:09.120 --> 45:13.160
"of the average viewer
are addressed? Yours sincerely,
Mr Needham, Belfast."

45:13.160 --> 45:16.160
We all thought, "Yeah, fair enough.
We must respond."

45:16.160 --> 45:18.880
And then Jeremy stepped into
the breach. Again.

45:21.720 --> 45:26.880
To get Mr Needham off my back,
I've actually come to the city
where he lives.

45:26.880 --> 45:28.880
Belfast.

45:32.840 --> 45:35.840
And this is the car I'll be testing.

45:36.800 --> 45:40.880
Renault's sporty little Twingo 133.

45:40.880 --> 45:44.480
HE COUGHS

45:45.640 --> 45:48.760
Unfortunately,
on the way over here yesterday,

45:48.760 --> 45:50.600
I caught a cold.

45:50.600 --> 45:53.080
Well, when I say cold,
it's actually gangrene.

45:53.080 --> 45:54.640
Of my lungs.

45:54.640 --> 45:58.960
But, I'm a man,
so I shall simply...

45:58.960 --> 46:01.160
HE COUGHS

46:01.160 --> 46:02.880
Excuse me. ..soldier on.

46:02.880 --> 46:05.880
Oh, has anyone got any Night Nurse?

46:12.160 --> 46:15.200
Oh, yes! I should say so.

46:15.200 --> 46:19.600
I've always loved small,
hot hatchbacks

46:19.600 --> 46:22.400
and this is one of the best.

46:25.160 --> 46:29.720
It's so nimble and agile.
It's like driving a mosquito.

46:29.720 --> 46:32.320
Not literally, of course,
Mr Needham.

46:32.320 --> 46:37.560
It's impossible to drive
an insect and cruel to even try.

46:39.320 --> 46:41.040
It's pretty quick, too.

46:41.040 --> 46:47.600
Thanks to a revvy 1.6 litre engine,
it can get from 0-60 in 8.7 seconds

46:47.600 --> 46:51.480
and on to a top speed of 125.

46:51.480 --> 46:56.120
But is it faster than its big rival?

46:56.120 --> 46:59.360
The Fiat 500 Abarth.

47:01.680 --> 47:05.760
Tell you what, let's find out.

47:05.760 --> 47:08.000
ENGINES REV

47:10.280 --> 47:11.600
TYRES SCREECH

47:11.600 --> 47:12.960
Pleased with my start.

47:21.560 --> 47:23.200
No.

47:26.480 --> 47:29.440
Very, is the simple answer.

47:29.440 --> 47:35.840
Even if you drive with verve
and gusto, you should still average
40 miles to the gallon.

47:35.840 --> 47:41.440
However, that said, the Fiat 500
Abarth will average 43 miles
to the gallon.

47:47.200 --> 47:48.600
Simple.

47:48.600 --> 47:53.720
The Renault is Â£1,000 cheaper
and you can have one now.

47:53.720 --> 47:57.360
The waiting list for an Abarth
stretches into 2010.

47:57.360 --> 48:00.520
And I shall be dead by then.

48:00.520 --> 48:04.120
In fact, the way I'm feeling,
I'll probably be dead by 5.30.

48:04.120 --> 48:07.640
But I'm not making a fuss,
I'm just making a point.

48:07.640 --> 48:12.360
Soldiering on on your behalf,
Mr Needham.

48:16.120 --> 48:17.760
No.

48:17.760 --> 48:20.560
It's red.

48:23.400 --> 48:25.760
HE COUGHS

48:25.760 --> 48:28.640
Sorry, what was the question?

48:32.760 --> 48:34.920
In a nutshell, yes.

48:34.920 --> 48:38.920
If you buy the standard Â£12,200 car,

48:38.920 --> 48:40.640
it's not bad at all.

48:40.640 --> 48:45.680
But the car I have here has
what Renault call, the Cup Chassis.

48:45.680 --> 48:49.920
It's a Â£650 option which gives you
firmer suspension,

48:49.920 --> 48:53.520
ultra low-profile tyres
and 17-inch wheels.

48:53.520 --> 48:58.120
On a track, that's marvellous.

48:58.120 --> 49:01.800
But on a normal road,
it is extremely firm.

49:01.800 --> 49:04.840
The result is that on some bumps,

49:04.840 --> 49:06.720
the jolt is so bad,

49:06.720 --> 49:09.400
that your lungs can come off.

49:09.400 --> 49:11.360
Like that one.

49:11.360 --> 49:15.400
Is this thorough enough for you,
Mr Needham? I hope so.

49:18.480 --> 49:23.400
Its got a radio, air conditioning,
electric windows

49:23.400 --> 49:25.400
and electric door mirrors.

49:25.400 --> 49:27.480
But I'm afraid to say

49:27.480 --> 49:29.920
no parachute system.

49:33.400 --> 49:37.000
So, if you wake up one morning to
find that someone has put your car

49:37.000 --> 49:39.400
on top of a Harland and Wolff crane,

49:39.400 --> 49:42.640
you're never going to
get it down again.

49:42.640 --> 49:45.800
Bad mark for Renault there.

49:54.080 --> 49:57.560
You would be amazed how often
I get asked that question.

49:57.560 --> 50:01.040
To get an answer, I've come to
the network of sewage tunnels

50:01.040 --> 50:04.440
underneath Belfast
and for the next few minutes,

50:04.440 --> 50:08.200
we've asked the people in the city
to, erm, cross their legs.

50:09.520 --> 50:12.160
Oh, God!

50:24.160 --> 50:25.640
Oh dear! Splashing!

50:26.960 --> 50:28.880
Oh dear!

50:32.000 --> 50:33.560
I've considered
the tunnel's diameter,

50:33.560 --> 50:36.720
the car's centre of gravity,
everything and I've worked out

50:36.720 --> 50:42.120
the precise speed I need to be going
is 17.5 metres per second.

50:43.240 --> 50:45.800
I wish I knew what that was in
miles an hour

50:45.800 --> 50:47.960
because that's what I'm getting on
the speedo.

50:47.960 --> 50:49.800
I think it's about 37.

50:54.240 --> 50:57.080
37mph. It's roughly there.

50:57.080 --> 50:58.880
And here we go.

51:00.560 --> 51:02.200
Building it up.

51:04.120 --> 51:07.160
If this goes wrong,
I really am in a world of sh...

51:10.400 --> 51:13.120
Here we go! Aargghh!

51:13.120 --> 51:17.040
TYRES SCREECH

51:17.040 --> 51:18.800
Yes!

51:18.800 --> 51:21.240
Aarghh!

51:21.240 --> 51:23.600
There you are, Mr Needham.

51:23.600 --> 51:26.680
If you're looking to drive upside
down through

51:26.680 --> 51:31.200
the tunnels of Belfast,
Twingo 133 - absolutely ideal.

51:34.440 --> 51:37.600
Obviously,
it's not a very large car.

51:37.600 --> 51:41.400
But if you push those rear seats
all the way back,

51:41.400 --> 51:45.120
there is enough room
back there for children.

51:45.120 --> 51:48.640
Then, if you pull them
all the way forwards,

51:48.640 --> 51:50.760
there is enough space in the boot

51:50.760 --> 51:52.880
for Ross Kemp.

51:52.880 --> 51:58.240
So, Ross, are you OK in there? 
A bit of a squeeze but quite comfy.

51:58.240 --> 52:01.400
Quite comfy? Good.
Good mark for Renault.

52:05.440 --> 52:08.600
Obviously, we keep being told that
global warming is coming

52:08.600 --> 52:11.520
and that soon, we won't have
a winter to worry about.

52:12.960 --> 52:14.560
But we do now.

52:23.120 --> 52:26.400
That's why I've come to a little
slice of ice

52:26.400 --> 52:28.400
at the Odyssey Arena.

52:28.400 --> 52:30.160
ENGINE REVS

52:30.160 --> 52:31.680
TYRES SCREECH

52:31.680 --> 52:34.800
In theory, this should be
quite good because

52:34.800 --> 52:40.120
in a front-wheel drive car,
the heavy engine is pressing down
on the driven wheels,

52:40.120 --> 52:42.440
giving you better grip,
better traction.

52:42.440 --> 52:44.080
Here we go!

52:45.960 --> 52:49.720
A lot of revs, first gear,
5,000, 4,000...

52:49.720 --> 52:50.800
20, 30...

52:51.800 --> 52:53.120
46.

52:54.520 --> 52:56.280
107 registered there!

52:57.480 --> 53:00.240
133mph there!

53:01.440 --> 53:02.880
That is on ice.

53:04.840 --> 53:08.120
On a lot of cars, the anti-lock
braking system doesn't work

53:08.120 --> 53:12.080
on snow or ice, so let's see how it
is in the Twingo.

53:12.080 --> 53:13.400
And...

53:13.400 --> 53:14.600
Brake.

53:17.440 --> 53:19.760
I don't know why I'm looking at my
watch - there's no second hand.

53:21.600 --> 53:23.000
That was a long time.

53:26.560 --> 53:29.640
Now, the ice hockey players
are here and they want to come on.

53:29.640 --> 53:31.400
I know. Sorry. I'll get off.

53:31.400 --> 53:33.560
Come on!

53:33.560 --> 53:35.400
I'm sorry. I'm trying to leave.

53:35.400 --> 53:36.640
Just bear with me.

53:36.640 --> 53:39.880
This was harder
than you might imagine.

53:39.880 --> 53:41.520
There's the exit.

53:42.760 --> 53:45.240
No, I'm not going to make that.
I'm not going to make it.

53:45.240 --> 53:48.120
It's going to hit the wall.
Mustn't hit the wall.

53:48.120 --> 53:49.360
THEY SHOUT

53:49.360 --> 53:50.400
Wait!

53:50.400 --> 53:51.520
Keep your hair on.

53:51.520 --> 53:55.960
Sadly, the ice hockey players
wouldn't wait any more.

54:01.760 --> 54:03.640
They're playing a game!

54:03.640 --> 54:05.480
BLEEP. What was that?

54:06.960 --> 54:08.600
You've just pushed me!

54:10.640 --> 54:11.920
Arghhh!

54:17.920 --> 54:20.120
Eventually, this ended badly.

54:23.120 --> 54:24.560
Oh, my God! I hit him.

54:30.240 --> 54:31.920
That's astonishing.

54:31.920 --> 54:34.200
There isn't a mark on it.

54:34.200 --> 54:38.160
Since the skater seems to be OK,
we have to say

54:38.160 --> 54:40.880
the Twingo scores well for
pedestrian safety.

54:40.880 --> 54:44.640
Especially, if the pedestrian you
hit is dressed up like that.

54:54.600 --> 54:56.920
We've all been there.
Lost. In a shipyard.

54:56.920 --> 54:59.600
Your biorhythms are wrong.
You're feeling under the weather.

54:59.600 --> 55:04.000
You're just not concentrating quite
as hard as you should be.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.800
The next thing you know is...

55:05.800 --> 55:08.200
WOODEN CRATES THUD

55:08.200 --> 55:10.960
It's just one of those days where
you're judgment's out

55:10.960 --> 55:13.920
and you think, "I can go through
that." Then it turns out...

55:13.920 --> 55:15.960
METAL SCRAPES

55:15.960 --> 55:18.800
..you just can't.

55:22.800 --> 55:26.640
Of course, you may say that
you would never drive a car

55:26.640 --> 55:28.200
when you're feeling under
the weather

55:28.200 --> 55:31.120
but even if you are
that responsible,

55:31.120 --> 55:34.120
the day will still come when you
pull up at at junction,

55:34.120 --> 55:36.600
and while you're checking to make
sure nothing is coming,

55:36.600 --> 55:41.520
you will be hit up the backside by
blind Jack the milkman.

55:43.960 --> 55:46.280
ROSS KEMP LAUGHS

55:46.280 --> 55:47.960
That really hurt!

55:49.600 --> 55:51.920
Then, of course, the day will come
when you lend your car

55:51.920 --> 55:53.720
to your 17-year-old son.

55:53.720 --> 55:56.600
He'll be driving along in it and
he will think,

55:56.600 --> 56:02.360
"If I pull this handbrake lever, my
girlfriend's clothes will fall of."

56:02.360 --> 56:05.080
Of course, we know
that doesn't happen.

56:05.080 --> 56:08.040
We know that what actually happens
when you pull the handbrake lever

56:08.040 --> 56:09.600
is this...

56:09.600 --> 56:11.320
TYRES SCREECH

56:11.320 --> 56:12.880
Ah!

56:13.200 --> 56:15.920
Jeremy, that BLEEP hurt.
Thank you very much.

56:17.840 --> 56:20.920
This is one of the joys
of the hot hatch.

56:20.920 --> 56:23.600
They're as much fun to drive as
supercars but you can get

56:23.600 --> 56:25.520
Ross Kemp in the boot

56:25.520 --> 56:28.960
and they don't cost
a fortune to repair.

56:28.960 --> 56:33.640
The front wing, for example,
for a Renault Twingo, Â£66.

56:33.640 --> 56:39.920
The front wing for a Lamborghini,
Â£2,430.

56:48.440 --> 56:50.160
We've all been in this situation.

56:51.200 --> 56:54.120
The boat is still here
and I can make it.

56:56.200 --> 56:58.280
Come on!

56:58.280 --> 57:01.680
Being late for a ferry
can drive a man mad.

57:04.320 --> 57:06.200
TYRES SCREECH

57:06.200 --> 57:08.800
You forget there's going to be
another ferry later on.

57:08.800 --> 57:09.920
No, there isn't!

57:09.920 --> 57:13.160
This is the last ferry ever!
I must catch it!

57:14.640 --> 57:16.200
TYRES SCREECH

57:21.200 --> 57:26.640
The thing is, this Twingo could just
be the ideal car for the job.

57:28.640 --> 57:30.920
BELL RINGS

57:31.280 --> 57:33.080
TYRES SCREECH

57:33.880 --> 57:35.760
That's not gone well.

57:42.040 --> 57:44.920
A Fiat Abarth
may be more fun to own,

57:44.920 --> 57:47.560
more fun to look at, but this,
with the Cup Chassis,

57:47.560 --> 57:48.920
is sharper.

57:48.920 --> 57:50.280
TYRES SCREECH

57:55.640 --> 57:58.120
TYRES SCREECH

58:02.800 --> 58:05.160
It's a very good little car, this!

58:05.160 --> 58:07.240
TYRES SCREECH

58:07.240 --> 58:09.560
Handbrake. I've overdone it!

58:14.520 --> 58:16.680
TYRES SCREECH

58:16.680 --> 58:18.320
BLEEP

58:27.320 --> 58:30.400
Just because it's left, does not
mean I'm going to give in.

58:34.880 --> 58:36.240
How hard can it be?

58:36.240 --> 58:39.520
When I get out of here,
I'm going to hurt you. Here we go!

58:39.520 --> 58:41.000
TYRES SCREECH

58:41.000 --> 58:43.440
ENGINE REVS

58:47.440 --> 58:50.720
Aarghhhhh!

59:08.840 --> 59:10.480
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

59:10.480 --> 59:12.640
What was that?

59:12.640 --> 59:14.160
An acid trip!

59:14.160 --> 59:16.800
What? What was going on?

59:16.800 --> 59:23.280
Seriously. How much Night Nurse did
you take before you did that film?

59:23.280 --> 59:28.320
A lot. But not so much that I wasn't
able to work out that that car...

59:28.320 --> 59:30.280
It's just brilliant.

59:30.280 --> 59:33.240
It WAS a brilliant car.

59:33.240 --> 59:37.200
Where is it now?
It's at the bottom of the sea.

59:37.200 --> 59:40.440
As a test, that was rubbish.
I had a cold.

59:40.440 --> 59:43.520
I did. I didn't make a fuss,
I just got on with it.

59:43.520 --> 59:46.920
But the important thing is,
I survived. What about Ross Kemp?

59:46.920 --> 59:48.320
No.

59:48.320 --> 59:49.800
LAUGHTER

59:49.800 --> 59:51.280
Sadly, he didn't make it.

59:51.280 --> 59:55.320
And that really is a bombshell
that we can end on this week. Oh!

59:55.320 --> 59:56.680
Before we go,

59:56.680 --> 59:59.400
one more thing. The first three
programmes of this series

59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.480
went out at nine o'clock
rather than eight.

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.160
Tonight, we started at 8.30.

01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:06.200
Does anyone want to guess what time
we're on next week?

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.760
THEY SHOUT OUT DIFFERENT TIMES

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.960
No. We're actually not on at all.

01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:12.360
For reasons we don't understand.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:16.000
But we are back the week after that
at whatever time the Beeb

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.240
can squeeze us in.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.640
No mater. Thank you very much
for watching tonight.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:21.840
Take care. Good night!

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:24.720
