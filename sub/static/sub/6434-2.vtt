00:02.777 --> 00:05.470
You need to find another
place to be a bum at, homey!

00:05.471 --> 00:07.405
This is my complex! I run this!

00:07.406 --> 00:08.435
Chill out Vic, man.

00:08.436 --> 00:09.095
Wash your feet.

00:09.096 --> 00:09.696
What?

00:09.697 --> 00:11.513
You look like one of them
niggas from Australia.

00:11.514 --> 00:13.180
Nigga, you smoke all the weed.

00:13.181 --> 00:15.642
But what happened to us getting up
off our ass and growing our own bud,

00:15.643 --> 00:17.486
though... the community garden?

00:17.487 --> 00:18.880
Nigga, this is Southwest Compton,

00:18.881 --> 00:20.420
I ain't trying to be
no Goddamn farmer.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.676
Man, we're going to East
L.A. to pick up a brick.

00:22.677 --> 00:24.067
And check it out my mom's paying.

00:24.068 --> 00:26.777
Jesus, my clientele come
to me for the best weed.

00:26.778 --> 00:28.750
And I hear these guys
got the best weed.

00:28.751 --> 00:30.402
Surprise. Get you bitch
ass out the car!

00:30.403 --> 00:31.140
Hurry up!

00:31.141 --> 00:32.878
Do you gentlemen consent
to a quick search?

00:32.879 --> 00:33.491
Yes, sir!

00:33.492 --> 00:34.672
Looks like 2Gs.

00:34.673 --> 00:37.359
Pleasure doing business
with you bitches.

00:37.360 --> 00:38.647
Yeah, but what about my mom money?

00:38.648 --> 00:40.286
Although we ain't got
your mom's money, what

00:40.287 --> 00:42.368
we do have is the love
of God and out integrity.

00:42.369 --> 00:45.413
Act right, 'cause the sooner we get
to work, the sooner we're gonna be...

01:00.278 --> 01:01.686
Oh, shit!

01:02.459 --> 01:03.359
Hey!

01:04.581 --> 01:05.951
What the hell you doing in here?!

01:06.644 --> 01:08.035
Shoo, shoo! Shoo!

01:08.093 --> 01:09.481
Get out of here!

01:09.574 --> 01:10.622
Get... out!

01:19.344 --> 01:21.413
What the hell is all this?

01:21.763 --> 01:24.105
Vic, you seen my goat?

01:24.106 --> 01:24.913
Your goat?

01:24.914 --> 01:26.415
Well, he was just up in my apartment,

01:26.416 --> 01:29.629
kicking everything over,
spreading hoof and mouth disease

01:29.630 --> 01:30.510
all over the place.

01:30.511 --> 01:33.531
My bad, Vic. That little
dude frolics hard, man.

01:33.532 --> 01:35.617
I'm gonna keep a better
eye on him next time.

01:35.618 --> 01:37.547
Don't you think maybe
you're taking this whole

01:37.548 --> 01:40.795
Jesus thing a little bit too far?

01:40.796 --> 01:44.064
Look, you got goats, chickens
running all over the place.

01:44.698 --> 01:45.768
This is Compton, nigga.

01:45.769 --> 01:46.707
This ain't Jamaica.

01:46.708 --> 01:48.840
I think you ought to pack
this whole little fake

01:48.841 --> 01:51.373
nativity scene you got over here
that you stole from the mall or

01:51.374 --> 01:53.764
wherever you got it from and
find you one of them empty lots

01:53.765 --> 01:54.949
and go set up over there.

01:54.950 --> 01:56.169
Aw, come on, Vic, man.

01:56.170 --> 01:56.922
It's all right, man.

01:56.923 --> 01:59.526
You're lucky I ain't a snitch,
man, 'cause I'd have been had

01:59.527 --> 02:01.807
the cops come and
hauled your ass off.

02:01.808 --> 02:04.425
Matter of fact, next time
I catch you at my complex...

02:05.584 --> 02:07.673
It's gonna be punch-in-the-face time.

02:07.674 --> 02:11.149
Vic, you would really
punch me in my face?

02:11.944 --> 02:15.225
Hell, yeah, I'm really
gonna punch you in your face!

02:15.226 --> 02:16.950
Even though I love you
with all my heart?

02:16.951 --> 02:20.125
I'm gonna punch you in
your face with all my heart.

02:20.709 --> 02:22.338
This is fake, man.

02:22.522 --> 02:23.497
You ain't no prophet.

02:23.498 --> 02:24.929
You're a con man.

02:25.050 --> 02:26.617
You don't love those guys.

02:26.618 --> 02:29.388
You're living off 'em.
You are a parasite.

02:29.389 --> 02:32.028
Hey, Vic, why you always
look constipated, man?

02:32.234 --> 02:34.180
Yeah, yeah. You got
something to do with this?

02:34.181 --> 02:36.212
You got a lot of shit on your mind.

02:36.213 --> 02:39.089
Two words, convict...
"lease violation."

02:39.090 --> 02:41.202
You're on notice, Nigga.

02:41.687 --> 02:45.000
Hey, Vic, you do need more
fiber in your diet, brah.

02:45.007 --> 02:47.813
Your intestines look like
some top ramen noodles that

02:47.814 --> 02:51.850
you cooked and they got hard
again... in a fucked up bowl.

That's it!

03:10.473 --> 03:13.634
Pops was speakin' through
Vic when he kicked us

03:13.635 --> 03:15.118
out the courtyard.

03:15.119 --> 03:18.484
Yeah, man! God's gonna shows us
the perfect place to go, brah.

03:18.485 --> 03:20.947
No, no. I found the perfect
place on Google Maps.

03:20.948 --> 03:22.702
Who made Google, Tray?

03:22.703 --> 03:23.830
Sergey Brin and Larry Page.

03:23.831 --> 03:24.956
Bitch! You wish!

03:24.957 --> 03:27.745
But who made them, Tray?

03:27.746 --> 03:29.050
He messin' with you, man.

03:29.051 --> 03:30.467
No, their parents made them.

03:30.468 --> 03:32.464
God made them, Tray!

03:32.465 --> 03:33.722
I mean you feel me?

03:33.723 --> 03:35.246
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:35.466 --> 03:38.215
I mean, it's like he
gave us the vision, dawg.

03:38.216 --> 03:39.865
We're gonna find the
perfect spot, man.

03:39.866 --> 03:41.575
I can see it right now, man.

03:41.576 --> 03:42.603
All kinds of vegetables.

03:42.604 --> 03:46.575
We're gonna have like lettuce,
cucumbers, Spanish onions...

03:46.576 --> 03:47.420
Asparagus.

03:47.421 --> 03:48.436
...Asparagus.

03:49.143 --> 03:51.538
What about the mother
fuckin' weed, man?

03:51.539 --> 03:53.297
You ain't sayin' shit about the weed!

03:53.298 --> 03:54.459
Damn!

03:56.106 --> 03:58.677
Man! Of course we're
gonna grow the weed, man,

03:58.678 --> 04:01.288
But we got to get the vegetables
on deck to camouflage the weed!

04:01.289 --> 04:02.685
Well, you got to say that, man!

04:02.686 --> 04:04.452
Well, I'm telling you right now, man!

04:04.453 --> 04:05.474
Maggie got a plan on it.

04:05.475 --> 04:07.058
She gonna hook the shit up.
Hey, Maggs!

04:07.059 --> 04:09.479
Yo, hold up! I'm dealing
with this Facebook bitch.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.020
Come on, Maggie!

04:12.021 --> 04:14.784
Why is this bitch trippin'
because I wrote on her picture

04:14.785 --> 04:17.118
that she looks drunk?
It's a party pic.

04:17.119 --> 04:18.801
Tell me the bitch don't look drunk.

04:18.802 --> 04:21.971
I mean, yeah, she look drunk, man,
but that's beside the point, man.

04:21.971 --> 04:23.514
The girl got alcoholism
in her family.

04:23.515 --> 04:24.733
You ain't got to talk
about her like that.

04:24.734 --> 04:27.815
So? I wrote "lol,"
Jesus. Man, it was a joke.

04:27.816 --> 04:30.160
Look. Now she's writing on
all my picks, talking about

04:30.161 --> 04:34.572
I'm a bitch, my face look stank,
I got a washing-machine shape, and

04:34.573 --> 04:37.070
now these bitches are
liking all her comments, man!

04:37.071 --> 04:38.768
Yo, you're omniscient.

04:38.769 --> 04:42.564
Tell me her deepest, darkest secret
so I can blast that on Facebook.

04:42.565 --> 04:43.960
- Maggie...
- What?

04:43.961 --> 04:45.207
I ain't gonna be able to do it.

04:45.208 --> 04:48.482
Man! Boonie, you're good with insults.
Give me something for this bitch.

04:48.483 --> 04:50.821
Let me see girlie. Shit boy, this
bitch fine as a mother fucker!

04:50.822 --> 04:51.604
What?!

04:51.605 --> 04:52.978
She got pregnant, she
can keep it for real.

04:52.979 --> 04:54.675
That's them half-breed babies.

04:54.676 --> 04:56.607
Yeah, she's adorable.

04:56.608 --> 04:59.330
Give me that. What?
Now this bitch says

04:59.331 --> 05:01.647
she gonna slap me when
she see me next?!

05:01.648 --> 05:04.248
Bitch, you ain't ever
seein' me, bitch!

05:04.249 --> 05:05.919
- You better let her know.
- Come at me, bitch!

05:05.920 --> 05:08.152
- Yeah!
- Here's my location finder...

05:08.153 --> 05:08.824
Bitch!

05:08.825 --> 05:10.662
- You know what I'm sayin, bitch!
- You go, Maggs.

05:10.663 --> 05:12.060
- Don't do that, Maggie.
- I'm gonna post it.

05:12.061 --> 05:13.386
Man, why you pump her up?

05:13.387 --> 05:14.511
Post it.

05:15.213 --> 05:17.020
Post that shit, bitch!

05:17.021 --> 05:19.179
Bitches be too scared to
come to Compton anyway.

05:19.180 --> 05:21.639
Yeah. You know.

05:21.640 --> 05:22.835
This is it!

05:22.836 --> 05:25.616
Oh, snap! Look, y'all! Whoo!

05:25.617 --> 05:27.211
This is the spot, man!

05:27.212 --> 05:28.759
It's the one Pops told me about!

05:28.760 --> 05:30.218
It's beautiful, ain't it?

05:30.219 --> 05:33.458
Hey, man, I buried my pit
bull Biscuits up in there, man.

05:33.459 --> 05:34.898
I know!

05:35.015 --> 05:37.179
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Isn't it trespassing?

05:37.180 --> 05:39.410
Hey, Jesus, hey, Tray's right, man.

05:40.112 --> 05:41.973
I don't know about
this 'hood, Jesus.

05:41.974 --> 05:44.321
There's a lot of
Mexicans around here.

05:44.618 --> 05:47.069
Aw, man, stop your frettin', brah!

05:47.070 --> 05:48.240
This is the spot, man!

05:48.241 --> 05:49.656
Can't you feel it? I can!

05:49.657 --> 05:52.114
Yo, this is a lot bigger
that what we budgeted for.

05:52.115 --> 05:53.711
We're gonna need a
lot more fertilizer.

05:53.712 --> 05:54.920
Wait, wait, wait. When
did we get a budget?

05:54.921 --> 05:58.180
Well, we don't have one
now, but, you know, our plan

05:58.181 --> 05:59.882
is to talk to a few investors.

05:59.883 --> 06:04.597
What investors? What
you talkin' 'bout, Jesus?

06:06.396 --> 06:10.222
So, now, you know, I'm gonna
be straight with you, 'cause

06:10.223 --> 06:13.624
you know I'm a Christian woman
and you are now and always

06:13.625 --> 06:18.801
will by my Lord and savior and I
will love you until the day I die.

06:19.249 --> 06:24.361
However, what I know about you
is that you will fuck off some money

06:24.362 --> 06:28.869
in a heartbeat, and Ms. Tudi
cares very, very, much

06:28.870 --> 06:30.197
about her paper.

06:30.198 --> 06:31.566
We respect that, Ms. Tudi.

06:31.567 --> 06:33.670
Mm-hmm. Farming business.

06:33.671 --> 06:36.094
What the hell I know
about farming, huh?

06:36.095 --> 06:38.793
I know how to go to the store and
buy food. Now, that's what I know.

06:38.794 --> 06:42.155
Which one of y'all
niggas know about farming?

06:42.855 --> 06:47.305
You, Fish? Is that what they
teachin' you niggas in jail now?

06:48.005 --> 06:50.518
'Cause I know my idiot son
don't know nothin' about farming.

06:50.519 --> 06:52.662
The only this he know
how to grow is fatter.

06:53.932 --> 06:54.948
And, Maggie.

06:54.949 --> 06:55.651
Uh, what?

06:55.652 --> 06:58.338
Child, I love you, but you're
a hot mess. And quit writing

06:58.339 --> 07:00.683
that bullshit on Facebook.

07:00.931 --> 07:07.384
We can all see that. And Nigga,
who are you? Huh? Always smilin'.

07:07.385 --> 07:08.520
That's me.

07:08.521 --> 07:10.069
Stop!

07:11.660 --> 07:14.717
$600 for fertilizer? Really?

07:14.718 --> 07:17.286
I mean, you got to look at
it like this.. this is a major

07:17.287 --> 07:20.095
come-up, Ms. Tudi. You 'bout
to get pounds of weed...

07:20.096 --> 07:21.862
I mean, elbows, girl.

07:21.863 --> 07:24.693
And on top of that, you're doing
something good for the community.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.326
Jesus, I don't give a shit
about the community here,

07:27.327 --> 07:29.123
though I do need product.

07:29.124 --> 07:30.569
All right, Maggie. Handle the money.

07:30.570 --> 07:31.954
That's what's up, Ms. Tudi.

07:31.955 --> 07:34.811
I'm a handle the product...
all the product. And when

07:34.812 --> 07:37.993
I get my money back, then
I'll share the profits.

07:37.994 --> 07:39.487
And I got you on the muscle,
Ms. Tudi.

07:39.488 --> 07:40.662
Word.

07:40.720 --> 07:42.171
Hey, what you want me to do, Ma?

07:42.172 --> 07:42.854
Nothin'.

07:42.855 --> 07:47.264
Bad luck, just like his father. I
wouldn't trust him to stack shit.

07:48.708 --> 07:50.380
Lloyd!

07:51.622 --> 07:53.472
Lloyd!

07:55.039 --> 07:56.475
Lloyd!

07:58.076 --> 07:59.419
Vic, is that you?

07:59.420 --> 08:02.357
Yes, it is Lloyd. How
are you today, good sir?

08:02.358 --> 08:04.345
What the hell you care, and
why you talkin' so sadity?

08:04.346 --> 08:05.942
Actually, I don't care, Lloyd.

08:05.943 --> 08:08.664
The manner in which I'm
speaking to you right now is the

08:08.665 --> 08:10.684
way that professional
men conduct business.

08:10.685 --> 08:14.131
I got a job for you, unless
you're, uh, too busy sleeping in

08:14.132 --> 08:16.305
the middle of the sidewalk
in the middle of the day.

08:16.306 --> 08:18.899
Oh. You mean, like, uh, work?

08:18.900 --> 08:22.406
Yeah, I mean, like, work...
like private-eye work.

08:22.407 --> 08:26.647
One of your compatriots...
tall dude, got a perm,

08:26.648 --> 08:28.871
wears a dusty robe,
hangs out with Fish.

08:28.872 --> 08:30.557
Oh, yeah. You're talking
about Jesus Christ.

08:30.558 --> 08:32.636
He ain't Jesus Christ, okay?

08:32.638 --> 08:35.631
He's just some crazy dude
who thinks he's Jesus.

08:35.631 --> 08:38.440
Oh, no, no, no. He is Jesus Christ.

08:38.482 --> 08:43.133
He's... he's the son of God,
kind of kings... of the most

08:43.134 --> 08:46.797
high, God's only begotten
son, sent down here to save

08:46.798 --> 08:50.297
our mortal souls
from eternal damnation.

08:50.298 --> 08:54.462
But you know what? That
nigga ain't doing shit for me.

08:54.463 --> 08:57.112
He ain't bought me no car. He
ain't paid my rent. He's stingy.

08:57.113 --> 09:01.008
Whatever. I think he's a danger
to the community, and I want

09:01.009 --> 09:03.013
you to keep an eye on
him, follow him around,

09:03.014 --> 09:05.473
keep me posted on what's happening.

09:05.474 --> 09:06.167
How much?

09:06.168 --> 09:07.306
$10

09:08.907 --> 09:13.193
I sincerely apologize, but I have
to turn down that bullshit-ass offer.

09:13.194 --> 09:14.777
Nigga, you eat out
of people's garbage!

09:14.778 --> 09:18.883
Yes, but now I'm employed
as a professional lineman.

09:18.884 --> 09:20.035
Lineman?

09:20.036 --> 09:22.390
Yes. I wait in line for stuff.

09:22.391 --> 09:25.996
Then I sell place in line to people
who don't want to wait in line.

09:25.997 --> 09:26.841
And they pay you for that?

09:26.842 --> 09:29.805
Yes... lazy white boys,
Japanese kids.

09:29.806 --> 09:34.522
I got a iPad last week.

09:34.523 --> 09:35.988
One time I got $500.

09:35.989 --> 09:37.082
Are you serious?

09:37.083 --> 09:41.945
That right. So, I apologize. I
have to turn down you little $10.

09:41.946 --> 09:43.346
Okay, $20.

09:43.347 --> 09:44.247
$50.

09:45.154 --> 09:46.081
$25.

09:46.082 --> 09:49.233
Deal. I need some more minutes
on my phone so I can report

09:49.234 --> 09:53.297
back to you. And two big
ass beers a day, per Diem.

09:54.656 --> 09:57.508
Okay. You ain't gonna try to
play me and take my money and

09:57.509 --> 10:00.053
end up under the bridge
drunk somewhere, are you?

10:00.054 --> 10:03.108
Oh, Vic. I might be a man who
takes a dump in a semi-public

10:03.109 --> 10:06.142
place every now and then,
but I'm a man of my word.

10:06.143 --> 10:09.811
I see Jesus all the time. I'm
gonna report back to you, I promise.

10:09.812 --> 10:10.793
Deal?

10:11.499 --> 10:13.679
Go take a shower, man.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.501
You want me clean,

Co-founder of Apple.

Look. Come here. Come here.
Fish, That's why I fuck with

10:44.690 --> 10:47.355
him, but, of course, you don't
know because he's on a higher

10:47.356 --> 10:48.518
echelon than you.

10:48.519 --> 10:50.965
I'm just saying, brah, you want
to know how he made the money?

10:50.966 --> 10:52.493
You want to know how he got it?

10:52.494 --> 10:54.137
'Cause he gave it up to your boy.

10:54.138 --> 10:59.702
All I'm saying, Fish... the faith of
a mustard seed... of a mustard seed.

10:59.703 --> 11:02.748
You don't believe me?
That's all I ask.

11:02.749 --> 11:03.946
If you're gonna fuck with me.

11:03.947 --> 11:05.493
You got to believe, man.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.472
Watch this.

11:18.583 --> 11:21.968
Yeah! Whoo!

11:21.969 --> 11:23.062
That wasn't bad.

11:23.063 --> 11:24.694

11:24.695 --> 11:27.981
Okay, going down.
Going down. Going down.

11:31.692 --> 11:35.056
Whoo! Back ain't been

11:35.057 --> 11:36.891
carried them fat girls
across the River Nile,

11:36.892 --> 11:38.859
trying to get away from
them soldiers, man.

11:38.860 --> 11:41.152
Whoo! Them was some big old girls.

11:41.153 --> 11:43.171
Well, all got to do is believe.

11:43.172 --> 11:44.960
You got to believe in something.

11:44.961 --> 11:47.776
Why not believe in me?

11:50.787 --> 11:54.714
Fix your face, Fish. The
hard stuff down now, dawg.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.813
Let the easy work crack, dawg.

11:56.814 --> 11:59.841
Plant, then we smoke it, then we eat.

11:59.842 --> 12:02.766
Boy, it's finna go down! Good

12:04.740 --> 12:06.339

12:14.789 --> 12:16.652

12:16.653 --> 12:18.793
What can we do for y'all? Cerveza?

12:18.794 --> 12:22.311
Nothing. It's already done.
You made us a soccer field,

12:22.312 --> 12:23.227
Pele, huh?

12:23.228 --> 12:25.266
♪ Ole, ole, ole, ole ♪

12:25.267 --> 12:26.173
No, no, no, compadre.

12:26.174 --> 12:28.260
This ain't a soccer field, man.
It's just a community-service

12:28.261 --> 12:29.541
project on an empty lot.

12:29.542 --> 12:31.813
I already talked to the people
in the community, and they say it

12:31.814 --> 12:33.102
was cool, so don't even trip.

12:33.103 --> 12:34.060
Oh, that's cool.

12:34.061 --> 12:35.868
- That's nice.
- But nobody told us.

12:35.869 --> 12:38.282
I mean, it's not like you
did nothing bad, right?

12:38.283 --> 12:40.197
You just cleaned up the lot...

12:40.198 --> 12:41.759
for the kids, the Ninos.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.468
The community thanks you. Ting!

12:44.888 --> 12:46.978
Check this out. You
might want to clear out.

12:47.104 --> 12:52.347
It's really dangerous here...
...around now.

12:52.348 --> 12:54.410
It's dangerous time? Is
that what you're saying?

12:54.411 --> 12:56.362
No, it ain't dangerous.
It ain't dangerous.

12:56.363 --> 12:57.698
For real, Los trigger?

12:57.699 --> 12:59.686
You gonna come over here and
try to play us out like that?

12:59.687 --> 13:01.287
This is a community garden, man.

13:01.288 --> 13:02.302
Everybody gonna eat.

13:02.303 --> 13:03.873
Did the community ask
for this garden?

13:03.874 --> 13:06.076
No, but who don't like
vegetables, dawg?

13:06.077 --> 13:08.331
I get my vegetables from the store.

13:08.332 --> 13:12.716
But the good news is this lot
just became available for rent.

13:14.677 --> 13:16.088
Man, hold up. That's extortion.

13:16.089 --> 13:19.548
Is that what this is? Oh, you're
really gonna extort your boy

13:19.549 --> 13:21.414
Jesus Christ, man...
Your Lord and savior?

13:21.415 --> 13:24.068
Hey, we're agnostic.

13:25.777 --> 13:27.034
How much?

13:27.035 --> 13:28.835
$600.

13:28.836 --> 13:30.057
Pesos?

13:30.058 --> 13:31.464
Very funny.

13:31.465 --> 13:33.587
About as funny as that hyena
laugh you got, little mini-me.

13:33.588 --> 13:34.716
Ha!

13:34.717 --> 13:37.930
I know it sounds expensive,
but check this out... look what

13:37.931 --> 13:39.136
we've done to the place.

13:39.137 --> 13:40.712
Man, you ain't done
nothing with the place, man.

13:40.713 --> 13:43.469
We fixed this place up. And
I heard when you was in jail,

13:43.470 --> 13:44.930
you was the chile dog king.

13:44.931 --> 13:46.063
Know what I'm talking about?

13:46.064 --> 13:47.829
Get the fuck out of here
with them Lee dungarees on

13:47.830 --> 13:49.606
and that Goddamn quenceneta bracelet.

13:49.607 --> 13:52.783
All right, all right, all right,
all right, lookit... take your time,

13:52.784 --> 13:57.647
look around, and if your still
here tomorrow, rent's due.

14:00.223 --> 14:02.968
They didn't even say
thank you for the beer.

14:05.826 --> 14:07.006
Lloyd.

14:07.401 --> 14:08.696
Lloyd speaking.

14:08.781 --> 14:11.165
Yeah, it's me... Vic.
What's going on?

14:11.166 --> 14:13.889
Hey, man. I've been
travelin', trailing

14:13.890 --> 14:16.290
him all day long... let
me tell you something,

14:16.291 --> 14:19.441
boy... he bought sandals. He bought
ice cream. He's done everything.

14:19.637 --> 14:20.556
Oh, yeah?

14:20.557 --> 14:22.737
Yeah. Yeah, I see him right now.

14:22.738 --> 14:24.972
I'm behind some bushes
with some binoculars.

14:24.973 --> 14:28.766
He's rolling a blunt.
That's Jesus is something.

14:28.767 --> 14:32.767
Let me tell you something, boy...
I'd like to follow him all day...

14:32.768 --> 14:33.532
Is that so?!

14:33.533 --> 14:36.282
Ohhh! Vic! How you doing, buddy?!

14:36.283 --> 14:38.093
I knew I couldn't trust
your raggedy ass.

14:38.094 --> 14:39.446
Let me explain. Let me explain.

14:39.447 --> 14:41.373
Let you explain, huh?
No, let me explain.

14:41.374 --> 14:44.356
We have a contract... an
oral agreement... okay?

14:44.357 --> 14:45.802
Vic, I'm going! I'm going right now!

14:45.803 --> 14:48.450
Let me tell you something... you
better stop thinking like a bum

14:48.451 --> 14:50.269
and start thinking like a hobo, okay?

14:50.270 --> 14:53.216
You know what a hobo is?
A bum on the move!

14:53.217 --> 14:54.078
Let's go!

14:54.079 --> 14:55.695
Anybody want my spot for $30?

14:59.129 --> 15:00.369
Come on, y'all.

15:00.370 --> 15:03.824
Somebody take my spot for $20.

15:03.825 --> 15:07.115

15:08.621 --> 15:09.807

Don't stress. Fish, man.

15:16.864 --> 15:18.768
Them dudes ain't gonna
do nothing, man.

15:18.769 --> 15:19.699
We're straight, man.

15:19.700 --> 15:23.136
Yo, I believe $600 is way
too much money, and that

15:23.137 --> 15:25.457
leaves us nothing for fertilizer,
and that's just one month.

15:25.458 --> 15:27.138
Maggie, we're gonna be cool.

15:27.139 --> 15:29.811
We ain't gonna have to
pay $600. Trust me, man.

15:29.812 --> 15:31.123
I swear, we're straight.

15:31.124 --> 15:32.666
Well, if we're still here
when they come back, man.

15:32.667 --> 15:35.017
We're gonna have to pay them
something or get up out of here,

15:35.018 --> 15:36.512
unless you want me to
call some of my partners.

15:36.513 --> 15:37.830
That's what you ain't gonna do.

15:37.831 --> 15:39.803
No. No violence, dawg.

15:39.804 --> 15:41.251
You know I don't get
down like that, Fish.

15:41.252 --> 15:44.065
Man, that no-violence shit
is your rule, not theirs.

15:44.066 --> 15:46.033
You saw all damn tattoos?

15:46.140 --> 15:49.691
I don't mess with Mexicans
who got more that two tattoo's.

15:49.692 --> 15:52.122
Even Boonie drunk ass

15:52.123 --> 15:55.316
Do you all have any

15:55.317 --> 15:57.822
Come on, man. How long

15:57.823 --> 15:59.838

16:11.213 --> 16:13.422
and come get you some

16:13.423 --> 16:15.839
This shit is good

16:17.414 --> 16:19.472
What do you all want me to do, huh?

16:19.473 --> 16:22.756
Well, we was hoping
to avoid violence...

16:22.757 --> 16:27.192
Ha! Violence. Avoid violence?
Let me explain something to you.

16:27.193 --> 16:30.544
You can either have violence
with the Mexicans or you're

16:30.545 --> 16:35.239
gonna have violence with me if I
don't get my shit the you promised it.

16:35.649 --> 16:37.805
So, y'all need to make a decision.

16:37.806 --> 16:39.803
I'm not gonna be
extorted by anybody.

16:39.804 --> 16:44.308
So, you decide... who are you
more afraid of... them or me?

16:44.309 --> 16:45.970
You got me?

16:47.138 --> 16:49.091
So, how much bread
we got left, Maggie?

16:49.092 --> 16:51.225
We got like $600 left for fertilizer.

16:51.226 --> 16:52.400
Yo!

16:53.636 --> 16:54.783

17:32.140 --> 17:35.044
♪ Let it shine, let it shine

17:36.511 --> 17:37.362
See, J?

17:37.363 --> 17:40.194
God's work is more
important than man's work.

17:44.567 --> 17:46.164
Get some singing lessons, Jesus.

17:47.254 --> 17:49.204
He ain't got the holy voice.

17:49.988 --> 17:52.334
All that hate don't look
good on you all, dawg.

Hey. Good morning, Lloyd.
What's going on?

17:59.910 --> 18:00.675
What you got going on?

18:00.676 --> 18:02.206
I'm just enjoying this life.

18:02.207 --> 18:04.031
Whoo! Ooh.

18:04.032 --> 18:05.597
Y'all got a little taste here.

18:05.598 --> 18:07.774
You mind if I get a little taste
to keep the wolf off my back?

18:07.775 --> 18:09.077
Nigga, it's 7:00 in the morning.

18:09.078 --> 18:10.919
Get your old drunk,
dirty ass up out of there.

18:10.920 --> 18:12.410
Chill out, Fish. Let him chill.

18:12.411 --> 18:13.288
Forget him.

18:13.289 --> 18:14.343
Hater. He's a hater.

18:14.344 --> 18:17.583
This the first time he's been nice to
me. Let's see what he talkin' about.

18:19.073 --> 18:20.287
You got it?

18:20.288 --> 18:21.283
Got what?

18:21.284 --> 18:22.371
The rent!

18:22.372 --> 18:24.263
I got a belt for your little ass.

18:24.264 --> 18:25.666
Get up out of here, little punk.

18:25.667 --> 18:27.764
You'll be sorry you said that!

18:27.765 --> 18:29.621
Whatever.

18:30.923 --> 18:32.333
Man, I told you they was gonna

18:32.334 --> 18:33.477
come through here trippin'.

18:33.478 --> 18:35.072
It's gonna be straight,
Fish, man, I promise.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.683
We're not straight. It's not cool.

18:36.684 --> 18:37.980
I got to take a whiz.

18:37.985 --> 18:39.766
Hey, look... we chillin', y'all.

18:39.767 --> 18:41.308
Sin queso, mother fucker!

18:41.309 --> 18:43.146
Get down! Get down! Get down!

18:43.147 --> 18:44.695
Go, go, go, go!

18:44.696 --> 18:46.710
Come on Lloyd! Come get some cover!

18:46.711 --> 18:47.841
I can't cut off my piss!

18:47.842 --> 18:51.079
You see me?! You see me?!
Don't look at me!

18:51.646 --> 18:53.278
Come on, Lloyd! You
better get some cover.

18:53.279 --> 18:54.693
Quick, man! Come get behind me!

18:54.694 --> 18:55.859
Mother fucker!

18:55.860 --> 18:57.796
- Aah!

18:58.393 --> 19:00.351
Jesus, get him, man!

19:02.143 --> 19:03.393
Oh, what the...

19:03.394 --> 19:04.275
Yo, man, you all right?

19:04.276 --> 19:05.094
Yeah, Holmes.

19:05.095 --> 19:07.025
Hey, you throw a rock at my homey?

19:07.074 --> 19:08.674
That ain't very Christlike, dawg.

19:08.675 --> 19:10.438
Hey, you really gonna come
over here and try to pill our

19:10.439 --> 19:12.172
caps over a little funky-ass land?!

19:12.173 --> 19:13.690
No, we're gonna kill
you our of respect!

19:13.691 --> 19:14.682
That's different!

19:14.683 --> 19:17.187
So, you either pay
or get the fuck out.

19:17.258 --> 19:19.806
Jesus Negro.

19:23.966 --> 19:25.967
Give me the bread, Maggs.

19:26.668 --> 19:28.787
Give me the bread, Maggs!

19:29.039 --> 19:30.919
Hey, hey, man, what you doing?

19:30.920 --> 19:33.103
It ain't nothin' but money, man.

19:33.543 --> 19:34.712
Here.

19:35.143 --> 19:36.376
Straight, trigger?

19:36.377 --> 19:37.743
We straight, spyder?

19:37.744 --> 19:39.404
Come on. We're good.

19:40.104 --> 19:42.105
We'll be back next month.

19:42.805 --> 19:43.705
Hey!

19:45.492 --> 19:47.697
Feel better now, doesn't it?

19:48.397 --> 19:50.853
Hey, man, don't coming 'round
here shooting at folks, man.

19:50.854 --> 19:52.709
You might fuckin'
hurt somebody, man.

19:52.710 --> 19:55.556
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
You all right?

19:55.557 --> 19:56.645
Yeah.

19:56.903 --> 19:59.403
Man, you gonna let them fools
come rob us, shoot at us,

19:59.404 --> 20:01.996
and then you're just gonna
heal them and say it's all good?

20:01.997 --> 20:04.728
Fish, what's so hard
about love and kindness?

20:04.729 --> 20:07.084
Forget this, man! Watch out!

20:07.104 --> 20:09.975
Yo, you can't buy
fertilizer with kindness.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.802
No fertilizer means no garden, G.

20:13.300 --> 20:16.133
Come on, man. You know we're
on a mission from God, man.

20:16.134 --> 20:19.509
This ain't nothin'. Let's bring it in,
man, so we can get it back together.

20:20.664 --> 20:22.148
I trust you, G.

20:22.149 --> 20:24.500
I know you do, Tray.

20:25.928 --> 20:31.145
Ohh. I'm telling you, whatever
they're doing out there is big.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.650
You should have seen it...

20:32.651 --> 20:36.540
Gunshots, speeding cars,
and the Mexican mafia!

20:36.619 --> 20:38.905
I knew it! Jesus, my ass!

20:39.295 --> 20:40.714
Knew he was up to something.

20:40.715 --> 20:41.652
Good work, Lloyd.

20:41.653 --> 20:43.140
You know, next week I want you...

20:44.032 --> 20:46.680
Hey, hey, hey. You can't be on
my couch in these dirty clothes

20:46.681 --> 20:48.116
you've been wearing
for two years, man!

20:48.117 --> 20:49.806
Get your funky ass up!

20:49.807 --> 20:50.993
Lloyd!

20:55.799 --> 20:58.616
I'll have to burn this blanket
after you finish using it.

20:58.617 --> 21:00.896
One night on the couch
is just one night.

21:00.897 --> 21:06.103
Guess I'll have to tough it out,
'cause I appreciate a job well done.

21:06.104 --> 21:07.609
Mm-hmm.

21:07.771 --> 21:09.445
Damn.

21:26.075 --> 21:34.086
