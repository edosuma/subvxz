00:19.019 --> 00:20.455
[narrator]
Previously on Swamp Thing...

00:20.542 --> 00:22.500
Cheer up, buttercup.
It worked.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.763
Forgive me if I don't gloat
over the death of my husband.

00:24.850 --> 00:28.941
-[gunshot]
-[Avery groans]

00:30.465 --> 00:31.727
Maybe if I put in
a good word,

00:31.814 --> 00:33.250
you might wanna
do me a favor.

00:33.337 --> 00:34.469
A favor?

00:34.556 --> 00:35.992
They did this
on purpose to me?

00:36.079 --> 00:37.037
Yes, and it worked.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.518
[screams]

00:40.605 --> 00:44.131
The cure for your Alzheimer's
rests in the cells that I saw
under that microscope.

00:44.218 --> 00:45.697
[Caroline]
Have you seen my pills?

00:45.784 --> 00:47.351
I thought
I set them on the counter.

00:47.438 --> 00:48.309
[Jason]  That's 'cause
you already took them.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.137
I'm slowly losing my mind.

00:50.224 --> 00:51.703
[Ellery]  Dr. Arcane.

00:51.790 --> 00:53.183
We're here to discuss
one of your patients.

00:53.270 --> 00:54.576
Alec Holland.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.317
He needs to be brought in
for treatment.

00:56.404 --> 00:57.231
What do you mean?

00:57.318 --> 00:58.493
Things could get violent.

00:58.580 --> 01:00.582
Stay the fuck away from Alec.

01:00.669 --> 01:02.018
[door slams]

01:02.105 --> 01:04.194
Do you think it's possible
to cure Holland?

01:04.281 --> 01:07.676
Do you want to cure the goose
of laying golden eggs?

01:07.763 --> 01:09.417
That man saved my life.

01:09.504 --> 01:11.941
[Jason]  I suggest that  we let him save millions more.

01:12.028 --> 01:12.985
[man] Move in.

01:26.825 --> 01:28.392
[objects rattling]

01:28.479 --> 01:29.741
[Caroline] What...

01:29.828 --> 01:31.091
Who's there?

01:31.178 --> 01:33.267
[Jason] It's okay.
It's just me.

01:33.354 --> 01:34.572
[breathing heavily]

01:36.096 --> 01:36.922
I'm so sorry.

01:40.665 --> 01:43.190
Your clothes...
You're a muddy mess.

01:43.277 --> 01:44.539
And where have you been?

01:46.932 --> 01:48.369
It's all right.

01:48.456 --> 01:50.545
I... I had to go
to the swamp, remember?

01:52.199 --> 01:53.722
That awful place?

01:53.809 --> 01:56.464
Yeah, I have to.
Just for a bit.

01:56.551 --> 01:58.509
You're leaving again?

01:58.596 --> 01:59.902
I found it.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.339
I found it, Caroline.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.476
A specimen more incredible
than anything I dared imagine.

02:09.390 --> 02:10.695
What's wrong?

02:10.782 --> 02:12.262
-Hey, hey, hey.
-No...

02:12.349 --> 02:13.176
Hey...

02:14.482 --> 02:15.787
Why are you trembling?

02:17.659 --> 02:18.703
[exhales]

02:21.663 --> 02:23.230
I... I had a nightmare.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.101
[sighs]

02:26.711 --> 02:27.843
That's all right.

02:29.671 --> 02:31.542
I'm here with you now.
[chuckles]

02:33.544 --> 02:34.502
It was dark.

02:35.981 --> 02:37.461
I was outside.

02:39.463 --> 02:40.421
I could hear...

02:41.509 --> 02:42.292
water...

02:44.120 --> 02:45.077
insects.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.431
I was looking for you.

02:55.566 --> 02:57.089
I kept calling your name.

02:57.786 --> 02:58.874
Jason...

02:59.657 --> 03:00.702
Jason...

03:08.623 --> 03:10.407
But you never answered.

03:10.494 --> 03:12.801
I was so afraid
something had happened to you.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.722
And then I saw a man,

03:20.809 --> 03:22.854
lying on the ground.

03:22.941 --> 03:24.508
He wasn't moving.

03:25.466 --> 03:27.163
He looked dead.

03:37.782 --> 03:41.395
It was all just
a bad dream, Caroline.

03:41.482 --> 03:43.397
The doctor said that you
might be experiencing more
of them as--

03:43.484 --> 03:46.226
-I remember, Jason--
-Darling, please.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.321
Now what I want you to do is

03:54.408 --> 03:57.672
just forget all about it, eh?

03:57.759 --> 04:01.241
Take your morning medication
before you go.

04:01.328 --> 04:02.633
Finish your reading.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.635
And later, when I'm back,
we can celebrate.

04:09.336 --> 04:10.815
If what I suspect is true,

04:11.729 --> 04:13.949
all of this confusion,

04:14.036 --> 04:18.736
feeling all this misery
of this awful disease.

04:18.823 --> 04:21.043
I'll be able to
make it all go away.

04:21.130 --> 04:23.263
-Hmm.
-Just like I promised.

04:23.350 --> 04:24.307
[lock clicks]

04:26.614 --> 04:27.658
Okay?

04:28.659 --> 04:29.704
Okay.

04:29.791 --> 04:30.922
Jason, wait.

04:32.184 --> 04:34.056
The man in my dream...

04:35.840 --> 04:39.191
I was afraid because
I thought it was you.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.019
[gas hissing]

04:41.106 --> 04:45.415
But when I got closer,
I realized it wasn't you.

04:46.329 --> 04:47.330
It was a...

04:48.375 --> 04:49.463
monster.

05:08.220 --> 05:10.222
[theme music playing]

06:08.933 --> 06:10.282
Liz?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.241
Jeez, I thought you'd be back
hours ago.

06:12.328 --> 06:13.634
Alec's missing.

06:13.721 --> 06:14.504
What?

06:16.332 --> 06:18.769
[Abby] I went out to the water
to find him, he was gone.

06:18.856 --> 06:20.380
But I found these
not far from the lab.

06:21.642 --> 06:23.383
-Fired recently.
-Yeah.

06:23.470 --> 06:24.558
It was like a war zone.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.081
I found these tracks in mud

06:26.168 --> 06:27.343
like something big had been
dragged away.

06:27.430 --> 06:28.910
I think
someone's taken him, Liz.

06:28.997 --> 06:30.868
-You think the CDC's involved?
-No, no, no.

06:30.955 --> 06:33.088
This goes way,
way beyond Atlanta.

06:33.175 --> 06:34.611
Harlan's been reassigned.

06:34.698 --> 06:35.786
I've been kicked off
my own investigation.

06:35.873 --> 06:37.266
Suddenly people are showing up

06:37.353 --> 06:38.572
and asking questions
about Alec Holland.

06:38.659 --> 06:39.921
They knew about his condition,

06:40.008 --> 06:41.575
about his
regenerative abilities.

06:41.662 --> 06:42.967
I don't... I don't...
Who even knows Holland's--

06:43.054 --> 06:44.491
Woodrue. Has to be.

06:44.578 --> 06:46.449
I... [sighs]

06:46.536 --> 06:48.538
I gave him a tissue sample
before I left.

06:50.671 --> 06:51.628
So, what are we dealing with?

06:51.715 --> 06:52.542
I don't care.

06:53.848 --> 06:55.197
I'm not giving up on Alec.

06:57.242 --> 06:59.680
I know that I've completely
turned your life upside down.

06:59.767 --> 07:00.985
I know. But if...

07:01.072 --> 07:02.552
-you could please help me...
-[sighs]

07:02.639 --> 07:03.423
...I could really use it
right now, Liz--

07:03.510 --> 07:05.076
Look, Abby.

07:05.163 --> 07:06.817
You and me, seventh grade.

07:06.904 --> 07:08.776
I... It was a long time ago.

07:08.863 --> 07:10.081
Not so long.

07:10.168 --> 07:11.474
We were walking home
from school

07:11.561 --> 07:13.128
and this pick-up drives by

07:13.215 --> 07:15.043
and the driver yells
something disgusting at me.

07:15.130 --> 07:18.002
The other kids we were with
just laughed it off.

07:18.089 --> 07:20.004
You got the license plate

07:20.091 --> 07:21.528
and then I got it published
in the  Weekly.

07:21.615 --> 07:23.617
-My first story, actually.
-Mmm-hmm.

07:23.704 --> 07:25.227
Yeah.

07:25.314 --> 07:28.186
You always had my back,
Abby, and I got yours.

07:30.058 --> 07:30.885
Okay.

07:32.539 --> 07:33.365
So, what's the plan?

07:36.151 --> 07:38.283
Woodrue could know
where they took Alec.

07:38.370 --> 07:39.197
And then?

07:39.284 --> 07:40.460
Haven't got that far yet.

07:53.908 --> 07:55.866
Make sure he's damn good
and secure.

07:55.953 --> 07:57.128
[man] Yes, sir.

07:57.215 --> 07:58.695
[gas hissing]

07:58.782 --> 08:00.567
[machine beeping]

08:15.495 --> 08:17.018
[Jason] Don't! Don't touch it.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.412
You could contaminate
the specimen.

08:21.849 --> 08:23.067
Well, are you sure that he...

08:24.199 --> 08:25.592
it's still alive?

08:25.679 --> 08:27.681
Plant seeds have survived

08:27.768 --> 08:30.074
the most extreme
climates imaginable,

08:30.161 --> 08:33.556
only to germinate years,
even centuries later.

08:36.298 --> 08:37.255
And these lights?

08:38.039 --> 08:38.909
Green spectrum.

08:41.129 --> 08:42.478
It's been known

08:42.565 --> 08:43.479
-to inhibit plant growth.
-[switch clicks]

08:44.524 --> 08:46.090
Should the need arise,

08:46.177 --> 08:49.616
it'll slow the creature's
regenerative capabilities.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.922
You mean,
if the poor bastard wakes up.

08:52.009 --> 08:56.448
Fortunately
for everyone involved,
it's highly unlikely.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.494
[Vendetti] The lab
is all powered up.

08:58.581 --> 09:00.714
And backup generators are set
just in case.

09:00.801 --> 09:01.889
Anything else?

09:01.976 --> 09:03.194
Yes, for you to leave.

09:07.503 --> 09:08.939
You got it all
figured out, huh?

09:12.073 --> 09:13.074
How long do you think
it'll take

09:13.161 --> 09:14.510
to do your initial assessment?

09:16.077 --> 09:17.469
Less time if I'm alone.

09:20.385 --> 09:22.605
I got a few things
I need to attend to anyway.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.174
You let me know
what you find out.

09:37.838 --> 09:40.623
-[nozzle squeaking]
-[gas hissing]

09:46.324 --> 09:49.066
We'll let you
thaw out a little.

09:49.153 --> 09:50.807
Then I'll have a look
under the hood.

09:56.247 --> 09:58.032
[monitor beeping]

10:02.863 --> 10:03.907
[door opens]

10:05.474 --> 10:06.388
[Daniel] Who's...

10:06.475 --> 10:08.520
Who... Who's there?

10:11.567 --> 10:14.701
[exhales] Whew. Time flies,
doesn't it, Daniel?

10:14.788 --> 10:16.441
You?

10:16.528 --> 10:17.704
The studio guy.

10:19.793 --> 10:22.491
I'm really sorry about
all this.

10:22.578 --> 10:24.188
Sorry?

10:24.275 --> 10:26.277
You're the reason
I'm stuck here.

10:26.364 --> 10:29.019
That's kind of a matter of
perception, don't you think?

10:30.107 --> 10:32.240
Speaking of which...

10:32.327 --> 10:33.720
There's something
you need to see.

10:39.290 --> 10:40.291
What the...

10:45.079 --> 10:46.036
[echoing] Liz.

10:46.558 --> 10:47.516
Liz?

10:47.603 --> 10:48.735
[Abby] Shh.

10:48.822 --> 10:49.910
We have to hide.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.304
[rustling]

10:53.391 --> 10:56.046
[metal pipe clattering]

10:58.396 --> 10:59.876
-[door opens]
-[Wyler] Go check it out.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.009
[Wyler] Over here.

11:04.402 --> 11:05.708
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:07.362 --> 11:08.493
[Crane] Go.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.199
[Wyler] Electrical room.

11:18.765 --> 11:19.766
Hey...

11:19.853 --> 11:21.506
Hey, wait a second, guys.

11:21.593 --> 11:22.551
[Crane] Show yourselves.

11:24.379 --> 11:26.076
-[gun cocks]
-Guys?

11:26.163 --> 11:27.077
[Crane] Last chance.

11:31.734 --> 11:32.692
Don't shoot.

11:34.389 --> 11:36.870
My name is Dr. Abigail Arcane,
I'm with the CDC.

11:36.957 --> 11:38.219
We are not a threat.

11:38.306 --> 11:40.264
Please put your guns down.

11:40.351 --> 11:41.178
Take them.

11:41.265 --> 11:42.614
Abby, go!

11:43.354 --> 11:45.574
[gunshots]

11:45.661 --> 11:46.488
[Abby gasps]

11:51.145 --> 11:52.102
What's happening?

11:52.189 --> 11:53.974
You're seeing the future.

11:54.061 --> 11:56.063
Or more precisely,
one possible future,

11:56.150 --> 11:57.891
that only you can change.

11:57.978 --> 11:59.457
[panting]

12:07.074 --> 12:08.945
[knocking on door]

12:09.032 --> 12:11.426
Back in the shadow
of the Sunderlands again.

12:11.513 --> 12:12.557
Yeah, I know.

12:16.344 --> 12:17.432
Yes?

12:17.519 --> 12:19.173
Ms. Woodrue?

12:19.260 --> 12:20.130
It's Doctor.

12:21.436 --> 12:24.700
Yes, I'm Dr. Caroline Woodrue.

12:24.787 --> 12:26.963
Uh, I'm Dr. Abby Arcane.
This is my friend, Liz.

12:27.050 --> 12:28.791
Um, is your husband home?

12:28.878 --> 12:29.661
There's something we really
need to speak to him about.

12:29.749 --> 12:30.662
My husband...

12:30.750 --> 12:31.794
Is he all right?

12:32.621 --> 12:34.101
Um...

12:34.188 --> 12:37.104
Yeah, we're just...
We're trying to find him.

12:37.191 --> 12:38.888
Is it okay
if we come in for a moment?

12:48.202 --> 12:49.029
[door closes]

12:49.116 --> 12:51.248
I was, uh, making...

12:52.336 --> 12:53.163
tea.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.864
I'm sorry, did you say
that you're friends of Jason's?

12:57.951 --> 12:58.908
[kettle whistling]

13:04.392 --> 13:07.177
Yes, we met a few days ago
at Marais General.

13:07.264 --> 13:09.832
Jason is analyzing a sample
I brought in.

13:16.012 --> 13:16.926
What's that sound?

13:24.847 --> 13:26.980
Um, Doctor, I, uh...

13:28.677 --> 13:30.244
I don't wanna pry...

13:30.331 --> 13:31.985
Have you been taking
your medication?

13:32.072 --> 13:33.073
Medications?

13:34.814 --> 13:36.424
Yes. Of course.

13:37.555 --> 13:38.643
Every morning.

13:38.730 --> 13:39.644
Okay.

13:42.386 --> 13:43.213
Abby?

13:48.653 --> 13:51.178
Caroline, did Jason go
to the swamp last night?

13:51.265 --> 13:52.701
[Caroline] I hate the swamp.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.834
I hate what this
awful place is doing to Jason.

13:59.751 --> 14:01.405
He doesn't have many friends,
you know.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.409
[Abby] Yeah,
I understand how hard
that might be.

14:05.496 --> 14:08.238
But I also have a friend,
his name is Alec Holland,

14:08.325 --> 14:10.719
and I'm afraid Jason might do
something terrible to him.

14:10.806 --> 14:11.938
So, I need to speak to him.

14:13.461 --> 14:14.549
I'm sorry.

14:15.463 --> 14:16.856
Did I offer you any tea?

14:19.293 --> 14:20.337
No, Doctor.

14:23.471 --> 14:25.865
Um, I'd like to check back
in on you if I can.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.128
I'd like that.

14:28.737 --> 14:29.607
Okay.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.872
[Caroline] Jason...

14:32.959 --> 14:35.570
Jason's always been
a brilliant man.

14:35.657 --> 14:38.486
Maybe a little too brilliant
for his own good.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.444
When you find him...

14:42.055 --> 14:43.491
try to understand.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.060
Everything he's done...

14:48.713 --> 14:50.890
everything he's doing...

14:54.806 --> 14:55.895
[softly] it was for me.

14:58.332 --> 14:59.899
-[Liz] Is she...
-[Abby] Yeah.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.466
Advanced-stage Alzheimer's.

15:02.553 --> 15:04.512
[exhales] Woodrue is
not doing her any favors

15:04.599 --> 15:07.167
by bringing her here
or leaving her
in that house alone.

15:07.254 --> 15:09.125
We find him, you can tell him.

15:09.212 --> 15:11.345
[classical music playing]

15:11.432 --> 15:14.435
[Jason] Beginning vivisection
on subject identified
as Holland, A.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.698
Subject has sustained
massive trauma

15:16.785 --> 15:19.962
from multiple gunshot wounds
and nitrogen freezing.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.443
On examination,

15:22.530 --> 15:25.185
all visible epidermis
appears to be infested

15:25.272 --> 15:27.752
with plant-like fibers
and spores.

15:28.884 --> 15:29.885
Hmm.

15:30.973 --> 15:32.714
Shall we? [exhales]

15:35.151 --> 15:36.848
[crunching]

15:42.158 --> 15:44.987
Subject's tissue
has hardened dramatically.

15:45.074 --> 15:46.554
[grunts]

15:46.641 --> 15:49.861
Indeed, "tissue" may not be
the correct term

15:49.949 --> 15:52.429
for such a peculiar type
of dermis at all.

15:54.257 --> 15:55.955
[crunching continues]

16:00.089 --> 16:03.658
[sighs] I have now completed
the Y-incision.

16:03.745 --> 16:08.010
Now continuing through
the subject's epidermal layers.

16:18.716 --> 16:20.588
[grunts]

16:27.899 --> 16:28.726
[grunts]

16:31.077 --> 16:32.643
[screaming]

16:33.775 --> 16:34.819
[panting]

16:34.906 --> 16:36.169
What are you doing to me?

16:39.215 --> 16:40.651
I checked with
the hospital staff

16:40.738 --> 16:42.349
and no one's seen Woodrue
since this morning.

16:42.436 --> 16:43.654
This is the photo you took?

16:43.741 --> 16:46.353
Yeah. He or someone made
notes on it.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.007
Okay. This reads like

16:48.094 --> 16:49.878
what you'd need to set up
a mobile medical facility.

16:49.965 --> 16:51.140
Okay. [exhales]

16:51.227 --> 16:53.012
We need to take a step back.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.187
If someone's taken Holland,
they're holding him somewhere,

16:54.274 --> 16:56.754
somewhere off the beaten path.

16:56.841 --> 16:57.755
[snaps fingers] Wait a second.

16:58.626 --> 16:59.801
[typing]

17:04.806 --> 17:06.677
Real estate? What...

17:06.764 --> 17:09.071
Sunderland properties.
Woodrue was working
for Avery, so...

17:09.158 --> 17:11.291
Ah, so, Avery could've provided
the location.

17:15.860 --> 17:18.124
Maria Sunderland's
consolidating her holdings?

17:18.211 --> 17:20.430
[Liz] Yeah.
These are filings
for sole ownership

17:20.517 --> 17:23.042
of all these properties,
all in the last 48 hours.

17:25.131 --> 17:26.784
[Abby] I wonder what Avery
thinks of that.

17:26.871 --> 17:28.786
There, look.

17:28.873 --> 17:29.787
Sunderland's old cement plant.

17:37.665 --> 17:39.493
This is it.

17:39.580 --> 17:42.017
Why would a biologist
be looking for an
abandoned factory?

17:42.104 --> 17:43.105
Because he has something
to hide.

17:44.976 --> 17:46.065
[gasps]

17:46.152 --> 17:47.283
Why are you doing this?

17:50.547 --> 17:52.419
Well, you might say

17:52.506 --> 17:54.551
that I'm completing
Alec Holland's study
into the mutagen.

17:58.338 --> 18:00.470
I feel it all.

18:00.557 --> 18:02.211
I'm not sure
how you're feeling anything.

18:04.039 --> 18:08.652
I've found no nerve
or pain receptors to speak of.

18:12.221 --> 18:13.614
But allow me to keep looking.

18:13.701 --> 18:15.833
No. Stop!

18:15.920 --> 18:17.270
-[crunching]
-[screaming]

18:21.230 --> 18:22.318
[grunts]

18:23.189 --> 18:24.146
[breathing heavily]

18:25.539 --> 18:26.322
[metal clanks]

18:31.458 --> 18:33.068
[grunts]

18:34.504 --> 18:36.289
[Swamp Thing crying]

18:39.379 --> 18:40.380
Remarkable.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.652
These are your lungs.

18:52.783 --> 18:55.090
Only they're not lungs.

18:55.177 --> 18:58.224
Human lungs have
capillary tubes

18:58.311 --> 19:01.096
that let the oxygen pass
through into the blood.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.882
They're something else
entirely.

19:04.969 --> 19:05.970
[grunts]

19:13.717 --> 19:15.763
[Jason straining]

19:25.903 --> 19:26.774
[Jason grunts]

19:30.081 --> 19:31.344
The same with your heart.

19:33.868 --> 19:37.698
It doesn't contract,
it doesn't pump blood.

19:37.785 --> 19:40.004
In fact, it doesn't appear
to do much of anything.

19:41.571 --> 19:43.399
But this is curious.

19:43.486 --> 19:48.056
Your vascular system,
and I use that term advisedly,

19:48.143 --> 19:50.841
appears to run through
your heart.

19:50.928 --> 19:51.929
But why?

19:53.757 --> 19:55.585
None of these organs serve

19:55.672 --> 19:59.154
any discernible function
whatsoever.

19:59.241 --> 20:03.071
Yet, here you are,
speaking to me even now,
without them.

20:03.158 --> 20:05.639
You're not making any sense.

20:07.118 --> 20:08.859
You believed that, uh,

20:08.946 --> 20:12.602
the disease that infected
Marais' citizens

20:12.689 --> 20:13.908
made you into what you are.

20:13.995 --> 20:16.998
But that is not possible.

20:17.085 --> 20:19.392
[inhales]
That's why I'm this way.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.611
No. No, it isn't.

20:22.395 --> 20:23.744
No, it isn't.

20:23.831 --> 20:26.007
After the explosion,

20:26.094 --> 20:30.838
your body must have mixed in
with the mutagenic plant matter

20:30.925 --> 20:35.146
and the plants somehow absorbed

20:35.234 --> 20:36.931
Alec Holland's memories.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.759
His consciousness, if you will.

20:38.846 --> 20:40.717
A human consciousness

20:40.804 --> 20:44.982
that remembered having, uh,
lungs, a heart, arms, and legs.

20:45.069 --> 20:47.420
And the plants did their best
to replicate them.

20:47.507 --> 20:50.510
[stammers] I don't understand.

20:50.597 --> 20:53.295
No. You're not a man at all.

20:54.949 --> 20:57.995
You're a plant...

20:58.082 --> 21:00.041
that thinks it's a man.

21:02.609 --> 21:05.742
[screaming] No!

21:05.829 --> 21:08.136
Why would you show me that?

21:08.223 --> 21:10.660
Why did you show me
Dr. Arcane and Liz dying?

21:10.747 --> 21:11.705
Why do you think?

21:11.792 --> 21:12.575
[monitor beeping]

21:13.794 --> 21:14.708
Is that really gonna happen?

21:15.970 --> 21:18.146
There are infinite futures.

21:18.233 --> 21:20.496
Am I supposed to do something
about that one?

21:20.583 --> 21:21.541
[softly] Daniel.

21:24.152 --> 21:27.851
Did you really think that
you were just gonna play
the Blue Devil in a film?

21:33.117 --> 21:34.205
[sighs]

21:35.250 --> 21:37.426
Blue Devil is a character.

21:37.513 --> 21:39.036
A hero in a movie
who gets his powers

21:39.123 --> 21:40.299
from a demonic suit.

21:40.386 --> 21:41.735
It's a movie!

21:41.822 --> 21:43.650
Oh, no.

21:43.737 --> 21:45.216
He's so much more than that.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.742
And so are you.

21:48.829 --> 21:52.267
Do you remember
when I asked you if you were
satisfied with your life?

21:52.354 --> 21:54.008
[Stranger]
It's Cassidy, right?
Stunts?

21:54.095 --> 21:55.879
Yeah.

21:55.966 --> 21:57.490
Would you say that
you feel satisfied
with things?

21:57.577 --> 21:59.230
The answer was revealing.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.624
It's too bad casting only
looks at me like a stunt man.

22:01.711 --> 22:03.887
I'd give anything
to have that role.

22:03.974 --> 22:06.107
So, you think
you're doing me a favor?

22:06.194 --> 22:09.066
I didn't ask
for any of this.

22:09.153 --> 22:11.242
-If I could get out
of these restraints, I'd--
-[gasps excitedly]

22:11.330 --> 22:12.243
You'd what?

22:15.029 --> 22:15.986
You'd what?

22:18.554 --> 22:20.774
I'd leave this nothing
swamp town.

22:20.861 --> 22:22.384
Go fix your future yourself.

22:24.604 --> 22:25.866
I can't exactly do that.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.303
Why not?

22:28.390 --> 22:30.436
You're just gonna leave
Abby and Liz to die?

22:30.523 --> 22:31.611
It's not up to me.

22:35.136 --> 22:36.180
Goodbye, Mr. Cassidy.

22:38.531 --> 22:39.575
Hey, hold up.

22:41.795 --> 22:42.709
You're just gonna leave?

22:45.364 --> 22:46.365
What am I supposed to do?

22:47.757 --> 22:50.194
Whatever you want.

22:50.281 --> 22:52.762
Life's a journey,
Mr. Cassidy, and for
what it's worth, I...

22:54.373 --> 22:55.591
I almost envy yours.

22:59.334 --> 23:00.857
-[door closes]
-Great.

23:02.990 --> 23:05.209
No, no, no, no, no.

23:05.296 --> 23:07.473
This is not my journey.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.476
My journey was
a cross-country trip
back to frigging Malibu.

23:12.391 --> 23:13.479
[exhales]

23:13.566 --> 23:14.523
I don't believe this.

23:20.355 --> 23:21.574
[sighs]

23:21.661 --> 23:23.010
I can't believe this.

23:29.669 --> 23:30.844
[sighs]

23:30.931 --> 23:31.975
Hmm.

23:33.542 --> 23:35.805
I only got $640
a day to play you.

23:36.980 --> 23:38.634
It all happened so fast,

23:38.721 --> 23:40.375
I don't think I ever really
nailed the character.

23:43.117 --> 23:45.424
Maybe this time,
I'll finally get you right.

23:47.991 --> 23:49.819
-[energy buzzing]
-[groans]

23:53.780 --> 23:54.868
[screaming]

24:01.701 --> 24:02.702
[struggling]

24:05.879 --> 24:07.097
[grunting]

24:11.450 --> 24:13.669
Maria Sunderland
for Nathan Ellery, please.

24:14.888 --> 24:15.845
Yes, again.

24:16.759 --> 24:18.544
A message?

24:18.631 --> 24:21.111
Yes, as a matter of fact,
I would like to leave
a message.

24:21.198 --> 24:23.374
Tell him...

24:23.462 --> 24:26.726
Tell him he's not dealing
with my husband anymore.

24:26.813 --> 24:31.121
Tell him Avery was
plagued by... limitations.

24:31.208 --> 24:33.689
And his wife is not
so predisposed.

24:33.776 --> 24:36.300
I expect to hear
from Mr. Ellery immediately.

24:37.650 --> 24:38.564
[Avery] Maria.

24:41.175 --> 24:43.220
Avery.

24:43.307 --> 24:46.659
-I didn't expect to--
-Oh, I'm sure you didn't.

24:46.746 --> 24:49.836
Now just... stay calm.

24:49.923 --> 24:51.098
We are only here
to help you.

24:51.751 --> 24:52.534
Doctor?

24:55.581 --> 24:57.452
Who's this?

24:57.539 --> 25:00.150
Dr. Dennis Barclay,
from the Barclay
Psychiatric Institute.

25:00.237 --> 25:02.326
Mrs. Sunderland,
why don't we come this way?

25:03.719 --> 25:04.720
Right here is fine.

25:06.809 --> 25:08.724
Very well.

25:08.811 --> 25:10.726
Maria Sunderland, I have
received a court order,
duly authorized,

25:10.813 --> 25:13.076
to place you in
a secure holding facility

25:13.163 --> 25:15.775
while awaiting a full
psychiatric evaluation.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.777
You have no right.

25:17.864 --> 25:20.780
A recent incident involving
Dr. Abigail Arcane
and a young child

25:20.867 --> 25:22.259
who'd been in your charge.

25:22.346 --> 25:24.087
This was the hardest
decision I've ever made,

25:24.174 --> 25:26.220
but you know this
is the right thing, Maria.

25:31.617 --> 25:32.574
Oh, my God.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.316
[struggling] No!

25:35.403 --> 25:37.144
[Barclay] It would be best
if you didn't 'cause a fuss.

25:37.231 --> 25:38.885
God damn you, Avery.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.103
[Avery] It's okay, honey.

25:40.190 --> 25:41.931
I'm back now,

25:42.018 --> 25:43.454
and we're going to make sure
you get the help you need.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.630
[inhales sharply] No.

25:46.457 --> 25:48.068
No!

25:48.155 --> 25:51.158
[Avery] You men take
good care of her now.

25:51.245 --> 25:53.334
-[door closes]
-I just want
my beautiful Maria back.

26:03.518 --> 26:04.563
[indistinct chatter]

26:16.662 --> 26:18.446
Hey, Matty.

26:18.533 --> 26:19.795
Thought you were
working tonight.

26:21.536 --> 26:22.581
Taking a personal day.

26:24.017 --> 26:25.627
Hmm.

26:25.714 --> 26:28.151
Saw your mom
in here earlier.

26:28.238 --> 26:29.892
Looked like you two
were really getting into it.

26:33.026 --> 26:34.984
Just not sure how I feel
about the job right now.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.682
[Delroy chuckles]

26:36.769 --> 26:39.032
That'd be every day for me
if I worked for my mom.

26:39.119 --> 26:40.468
I couldn't imagine.

26:40.555 --> 26:42.252
Man, she was one tough lady.

26:44.211 --> 26:45.386
Still miss her,
don't you, Del?

26:47.301 --> 26:48.432
Every damn day.

26:51.348 --> 26:52.785
Listen, son,

26:52.872 --> 26:56.658
no matter how hairy
it gets between you two,

26:56.745 --> 26:59.661
you gotta know Lucilia's
always looking after you.

27:02.055 --> 27:03.273
[inhales sharply]

27:03.360 --> 27:04.840
Yeah, well, sometimes I wonder.

27:07.364 --> 27:08.670
[softly]
Come on, can't be that bad.

27:11.673 --> 27:12.718
Maybe you ought
to give her a call.

27:14.458 --> 27:16.243
Yeah, I'll get right on that.

27:16.330 --> 27:17.897
I tell you what,
why don't you get me

27:17.984 --> 27:19.028
another one of these
when you get a chance, huh?

27:32.128 --> 27:33.042
[car doors close]

27:35.088 --> 27:36.655
[Abby] I thought
this place was deserted.

27:36.742 --> 27:39.048
[Liz] Been locked up for years.

27:39.135 --> 27:42.051
[Abby] Oh, my God.
It is a mobile
medical facility.

27:42.138 --> 27:44.010
Alec has to be
in there. I'm going inside.

27:44.097 --> 27:45.576
You can't just
charge in there.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.709
These guys have guns.

27:47.796 --> 27:49.319
Yeah, if they move Alec
out of Marais, I will
never find him.

27:51.974 --> 27:53.672
There should be
a hole in the fence,
around the side,

27:53.759 --> 27:56.065
that leads to a back door.

27:56.152 --> 27:58.764
I used to come smoke
with my Uncle Luc back when
he worked nights here.

27:59.852 --> 28:01.244
Don't tell Pops.

28:01.331 --> 28:02.158
Promise.

28:09.426 --> 28:10.253
[Abby whispering]
We're good.

28:14.127 --> 28:16.651
[door creaking]

28:26.008 --> 28:27.488
[Liz] Where the hell
are they keeping him?

28:40.849 --> 28:41.850
[Liz] Are you seeing this?

28:43.417 --> 28:44.287
Yeah.

28:47.856 --> 28:48.814
They're leading us to Alec.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.705
[indistinct conversation
in distance]

29:10.792 --> 29:13.099
-[footsteps approaching]
-Shit.

29:13.186 --> 29:14.143
We have to hide.

29:16.537 --> 29:19.975
[metal clangs]

29:20.062 --> 29:21.368
[Crane] It came
from the washroom.

29:41.475 --> 29:44.304
[Wyler] Let's start with
the electrical room.

29:44.391 --> 29:46.001
-[Crane] Show yourselves.
-They know we're in here.

29:53.835 --> 29:55.184
-Last chance.
-[gun cocks]

29:57.839 --> 29:59.841
-[saw buzzing]
-[generator powering up]

29:59.928 --> 30:03.410
[Swamp Thing panting]

30:03.497 --> 30:06.021
-[saw buzzing]
-[Swamp Thing groaning]

30:06.108 --> 30:07.762
[Crane]
We just lost all power.

30:07.849 --> 30:08.807
Drag 'em out.

30:09.764 --> 30:11.287
[guns click]

30:18.947 --> 30:20.035
[metal clatters]

30:35.050 --> 30:37.096
-[feedback over comms]
-[groans]

30:39.707 --> 30:40.795
[Wyler] Comms are down.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.144
[Crane] The hell?

30:42.231 --> 30:43.450
Lost all contact.

30:48.150 --> 30:49.238
Just open fire.

30:53.634 --> 30:54.591
[Liz] What are they
shooting at?

30:54.678 --> 30:55.505
I don't know!

30:56.898 --> 30:58.378
[screaming]

31:02.338 --> 31:03.905
[screaming continues]

31:06.777 --> 31:08.954
-What the fuck is that?
-The fuck...

31:09.041 --> 31:10.912
-Where'd it go?
-[Hooper] Where is he?

31:10.999 --> 31:13.088
What are we looking at?

31:13.175 --> 31:14.785
[Crane] I don't got eyes.
I don't got eyes.

31:16.918 --> 31:18.267
[distorted growl]

31:18.354 --> 31:20.574
[Gray] Fuck! How do you
fucking jam this?

31:20.661 --> 31:21.749
[Hooper]
I don't like this, guys.

31:23.925 --> 31:24.795
What are we doing?

31:28.147 --> 31:29.670
-[gun fires]
-[Blue Devil growls]

31:29.757 --> 31:32.281
Shit, where's
he coming from? Where?

31:33.152 --> 31:34.370
There!

31:37.243 --> 31:38.200
Fuck me.

31:46.165 --> 31:47.731
[growls]

31:48.515 --> 31:50.256
[screaming]

31:55.914 --> 31:57.698
Time to go, Doc!

31:57.785 --> 32:00.527
-I'm not finished yet. Wait.
-We don't have time for this.

32:03.182 --> 32:04.966
You have to get
the specimen out of here.

32:05.053 --> 32:07.490
It's covered. We're relocating
to a lab in Northern Maryland.

32:07.577 --> 32:08.796
I'll collect my wife
and meet you there.

32:08.883 --> 32:10.015
[Vendetti] Get to
your car and go.

32:14.062 --> 32:15.324
[footsteps approaching]

32:16.760 --> 32:17.718
[door opens]

32:23.115 --> 32:24.551
[door latch opening]

32:27.206 --> 32:28.250
[gasps]

32:28.337 --> 32:30.992
[panting]
It's... the devil.

32:34.126 --> 32:35.040
[Blue Devil snarls]

32:41.220 --> 32:42.308
[Abby and Liz gasping]

32:45.876 --> 32:47.878
The fuck?

32:47.966 --> 32:50.664
-Oh, my God.
-[both breathing heavily]

32:50.751 --> 32:51.752
What the fuck was that?

32:52.971 --> 32:53.841
I don't know.

32:54.755 --> 32:55.886
We have to go find Alec.

33:10.336 --> 33:11.772
It's like a goddamn warzone.

33:13.948 --> 33:14.905
[Abby] He's close.

33:30.660 --> 33:31.792
Alec!

33:35.100 --> 33:36.101
Alec!

33:39.539 --> 33:41.932
[breathing heavily]

33:48.722 --> 33:49.766
That's Holland?

33:51.377 --> 33:52.987
[Abby sobbing]

33:58.384 --> 33:59.994
-[Swamp Thing] Abby.
-[gasps]

34:02.692 --> 34:03.693
[Abby] What did they do to you?

34:08.176 --> 34:09.482
We have to get you
out of here.

34:15.009 --> 34:16.271
-[clangs]
-[Abby grunts]

34:20.449 --> 34:21.885
Can you move?

34:21.972 --> 34:23.061
The light...

34:24.236 --> 34:25.889
The light... The light...

34:43.646 --> 34:45.213
Look what these
monsters did to him.

34:54.875 --> 34:56.529
[plants squelching]

35:21.554 --> 35:22.685
[Swamp Thing groans]

35:28.430 --> 35:29.518
You came for me.

35:31.041 --> 35:32.956
Who did this to you?

35:33.043 --> 35:34.262
Woodrue and Sunderland.

35:36.351 --> 35:38.179
To them, I was
just a specimen.

35:45.055 --> 35:46.056
[exhales sharply]

35:48.233 --> 35:51.105
I have to go back
to the cove.

35:51.192 --> 35:54.152
-I have to know
if it's true.
-[Abby] Wait...

35:54.239 --> 35:56.502
Alec... Alec.

35:58.504 --> 35:59.983
You have to know
if what's true?

36:04.597 --> 36:06.033
[Liz] Back to the cove?

36:06.120 --> 36:08.122
He means Skeeter Cove,
where his boat exploded.

36:08.209 --> 36:09.297
Why go back there?

36:33.843 --> 36:34.931
[Daniel panting]

36:40.981 --> 36:42.112
[breathing heavily]

36:43.462 --> 36:44.463
It's gone?

36:53.428 --> 36:54.560
Oh, no.

37:06.136 --> 37:07.268
I'm going to follow him.

37:08.748 --> 37:10.140
I... I have to be
with him, Liz.

37:12.142 --> 37:13.927
Then I'll figure out
who those guys were.

37:14.014 --> 37:15.755
That blue thing included.

37:16.712 --> 37:17.974
-Okay.
-Hey.

37:20.107 --> 37:21.151
Be careful.

37:24.677 --> 37:25.678
You too.

37:36.079 --> 37:37.646
[indistinct radio chatter]

37:40.127 --> 37:41.824
[horn honking]

37:43.435 --> 37:44.653
[panting]

37:47.874 --> 37:49.658
[radio chatter continues]

37:54.620 --> 37:55.621
[pop music playing on radio]

37:57.492 --> 37:59.755
You've gotta be
fucking kidding me.

37:59.842 --> 38:02.932
[radio static repeatedly
interrupts music]

38:10.200 --> 38:11.201
[metal clanging]

38:13.203 --> 38:15.075
[radio continues playing]

38:28.088 --> 38:29.045
[panting] Caroline?

38:29.872 --> 38:31.744
Sweetheart?

38:31.831 --> 38:33.311
You'll never guess
what I found.

38:35.182 --> 38:37.837
It's the answer that we've
been searching for since...

38:37.924 --> 38:39.404
since you were
first diagnosed.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.320
Organic processes,

38:42.407 --> 38:48.021
capable of... not only
regenerating tissue,
but thoughts,

38:48.108 --> 38:49.065
consciousness and...

38:49.762 --> 38:50.719
memories.

38:52.591 --> 38:53.548
Caroline?

38:54.593 --> 38:55.550
Caroline?

39:00.163 --> 39:01.817
-Caroline?
-[shuddering]

39:05.168 --> 39:06.126
Couldn't you hear me?

39:10.130 --> 39:10.957
[Caroline whimpering]

39:13.655 --> 39:16.310
[Caroline] Remember...
to take...

39:16.397 --> 39:18.573
your medication...

39:18.660 --> 39:20.619
Caroline,
what did you do?

39:20.706 --> 39:23.970
-I remembered...
to take...
-No, no, no, no.

39:24.057 --> 39:25.188
You took them all?

39:30.977 --> 39:31.891
[Caroline groans]

39:32.805 --> 39:34.328
Oh, Caroline!

39:34.415 --> 39:35.329
[panting]

39:35.416 --> 39:37.244
Caroline. Caroline!

39:38.288 --> 39:39.420
No, no, no...

39:39.507 --> 39:40.421
You can't breathe.

39:41.814 --> 39:42.902
I'm sorry.

39:42.989 --> 39:43.946
It's my fault.

39:45.165 --> 39:46.166
I should have been here.

39:47.820 --> 39:49.125
I should have been here.

40:00.223 --> 40:02.487
Just give me
a few minutes to talk
to my wife, would you?

40:05.272 --> 40:06.055
[Avery inhales sharply]

40:10.277 --> 40:11.844
White's always been
a good color for you.

40:13.715 --> 40:16.457
I don't know
what's more impressive.

40:16.544 --> 40:19.852
That you're still alive,
or that you managed
to get me in here at all.

40:21.593 --> 40:24.073
Which judge did you bribe?

40:24.160 --> 40:26.946
Judge Murray took pity
on my situation.

40:27.033 --> 40:29.818
The fact that
he owed me a favor
or two didn't hurt but...

40:29.905 --> 40:31.951
But I just want to see
you get better, honey.

40:32.038 --> 40:34.040
-When Ellery finds out
about this--
-Ellery?

40:35.389 --> 40:36.782
What makes you think
that Ellery

40:37.696 --> 40:38.697
is going to help you?

40:40.220 --> 40:44.485
He told me that you
tried to cut me out.

40:44.572 --> 40:47.793
Now, the only way you
would've thought that a plan
like that would work...

40:47.880 --> 40:50.143
is if you had
made a deal...

40:50.230 --> 40:51.274
with Lucilia.

40:56.323 --> 40:58.456
Wow.

40:58.543 --> 41:00.545
You must be pleased
with yourself.

41:01.720 --> 41:04.549
I take no pleasure in this.

41:04.636 --> 41:05.854
I just want to know why.

41:07.552 --> 41:09.467
Why'd you do it?

41:09.554 --> 41:11.991
Just when all my hard work
was about to pay off.

41:13.949 --> 41:15.211
All of the lies.

41:17.039 --> 41:20.347
Getting other people
to do your dirty work.

41:20.434 --> 41:22.697
And all the nights
you spent with her.

41:26.309 --> 41:28.660
You should be grateful
I didn't do it sooner.

41:30.270 --> 41:31.489
It's a shame
it has to end like this

41:31.576 --> 41:33.491
after all we've been through.

41:33.578 --> 41:34.709
You could've stood by my side

41:34.796 --> 41:36.450
when we reached
the mountaintop.

41:46.547 --> 41:47.809
This isn't over yet.

41:47.896 --> 41:50.812
Oh, I think
we both know it is.

41:50.899 --> 41:53.772
Soon as this door
closes behind me.

42:11.267 --> 42:14.401
Alec, please, please,
please talk to me.

42:14.488 --> 42:15.750
Why did you want
to come back here?

42:17.839 --> 42:19.580
Because I have to
know for sure.

42:21.495 --> 42:22.627
You have to know what?

42:26.326 --> 42:30.286
Alec. Alec, please,
please talk to me.

42:34.247 --> 42:35.553
Alec!

42:35.640 --> 42:37.206
Alec, please talk to me!

42:39.818 --> 42:40.775
[breathing heavily]

42:42.124 --> 42:43.169
Alec...

42:55.398 --> 42:56.661
[exhales deeply]

43:52.281 --> 43:53.326
[Swamp Thing gasping]

43:53.413 --> 43:55.154
I am so sorry.

43:57.330 --> 43:59.854
This is Alec Holland.

44:00.899 --> 44:02.509
[meekly] No.

44:02.596 --> 44:03.771
This "thing"...

44:05.164 --> 44:06.382
is what I am.

44:17.393 --> 44:18.481
[inhales sharply]

44:18.568 --> 44:20.875
Alec Holland is dead.

44:26.881 --> 44:28.840
[theme music playing]
