00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:09.477 --> 00:12.611
¶ I was a girl in the village
doing all right ¶

00:12.613 --> 00:14.847
¶ Then I became
a princess overnight ¶

00:14.849 --> 00:17.616
¶ Now I gotta figure out
how to do it right ¶

00:17.618 --> 00:19.952
¶ So much to learn
and see ¶

00:19.954 --> 00:22.554
¶ Up in the castle
with my new family ¶

00:22.556 --> 00:25.457
¶ In a school that's
just for royalty ¶

00:25.459 --> 00:29.395
¶ A whole enchanted world
is waiting for me ¶

00:29.397 --> 00:33.465
- ¶ I'm so excited to be ¶
- ¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:33.467 --> 00:36.468
¶ I'm finding out what
being royal's all about ¶

00:36.470 --> 00:38.137
¶ Sofia the first ¶

00:38.139 --> 00:40.539
¶ Making my way,
it's an adventure every day ¶

00:40.541 --> 00:42.975
¶ Sofia ¶

00:42.977 --> 00:45.477
- ¶ It's gonna be my time ¶
- ¶ Sofia ¶

00:45.479 --> 00:51.617
¶ To show them all
that I'm Sofia the first ¶

01:05.199 --> 01:07.599
Here we are, Prisma.
Call Vor.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.902
Yoo-hoo.
Oh, little locket.

01:09.904 --> 01:12.838
<i> What is it</i>
<i> you desire, Prisma?</i>

01:12.840 --> 01:15.240
We came to this school
just like you said.

01:15.242 --> 01:18.510
Now where exactly is
the next of the Wicked Nine?

01:18.512 --> 01:22.414
<i> It can be found in the study</i>
<i> of the fairy headmistresses.</i>

01:22.416 --> 01:24.083
<i> It is well-hidden,</i>

01:24.085 --> 01:26.852
<i> but I know</i>
<i> you can find it.</i>

01:26.854 --> 01:29.455
I heard we have a guest teacher
today in alchemy class.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.857
Really?
Whoever could it be?

01:31.859 --> 01:33.592
Oh, what rotten luck.

01:33.594 --> 01:37.229
That rosy, nosy princess Sofia
goes to this school.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.698
I suppose she'll be
in class for a while.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.601
Giving us time to grab
the wicked trinket.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.269
Bingo.

01:47.708 --> 01:51.610
Curious who your guest teacher
will be today?

01:51.612 --> 01:53.278
It is I, Merlin.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.114
Greetings, children.

01:55.116 --> 01:58.650
As you enter your final
semester here at Royal Prep,

01:58.652 --> 02:01.286
it's time to dream
bigger dreams,

02:01.288 --> 02:03.322
shoot for higher stars.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.491
So for the rest
of the school year,

02:05.493 --> 02:08.327
you will be doing
advanced alchemy.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.562
Turn sawdust
into gold dust.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.898
Invisibility potions.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.766
- Wow.
- Yes, wow.

02:14.768 --> 02:17.102
But also whoa.
Not easy.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.937
Quite true, Desmond.

02:18.939 --> 02:21.507
So you'll need to find
an animal helper

02:21.509 --> 02:23.675
to assist you for
the rest of the school year.

02:23.677 --> 02:24.977
An animal helper?

02:24.979 --> 02:27.312
All the top wizards
have one.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.515
Even me.

02:29.517 --> 02:31.517
They help fetch ingredients,

02:31.519 --> 02:33.519
stir potions,
unscroll scrolls,

02:33.521 --> 02:36.421
and lots of other
useful things.

02:36.423 --> 02:38.991
Why, thank you,
Archimedes.

02:42.096 --> 02:44.863
Can my pet mink Lulu
be my animal helper?

02:44.865 --> 02:48.767
Mink, monkey,
or magenta mongoose.

02:48.769 --> 02:52.704
As long as they are
focused on working,

02:52.706 --> 02:53.839
any animal will do.

02:53.841 --> 02:56.341
I definitely want Clover
to be my helper.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.545
Your first advanced potion
is due tomorrow.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.680
You and your animal helper
will make it

03:01.682 --> 03:03.048
right here in class,

03:03.050 --> 03:06.485
so take a gander
and choose your first

03:06.487 --> 03:08.053
advanced alchemy project.

03:08.055 --> 03:11.690
Hm. What should
Clover and I make?

03:16.997 --> 03:18.797
Made it.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.732
Now, locket, exactly
what kind of object

03:20.734 --> 03:22.801
are we looking for?

03:22.803 --> 03:26.171
<i> A spinning wheel,</i>
<i> the very one whose spindle</i>

03:26.173 --> 03:29.575
<i> Sleeping Beauty</i>
<i> pricked her finger on.</i>

03:29.577 --> 03:31.476
Okay, let's find it.

03:31.478 --> 03:33.912
Then I can gather
the rest of the Wicked Nine,

03:33.914 --> 03:37.783
and drain their magic
to become so, so powerful.

03:44.558 --> 03:48.594
In what nook or cranny could
a spinning wheel be hidden?

03:48.596 --> 03:51.029
<i> It is not in this room.</i>

03:51.031 --> 03:52.931
<i> It is behind it.</i>

03:52.933 --> 03:55.200
<i> That wall, to be specific.</i>

03:55.202 --> 03:57.736
Behind here?
I don't see a door.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.671
<i> But you will.</i>

03:59.673 --> 04:01.573
<i> Once you light that candle,</i>

04:01.575 --> 04:03.909
<i> a secret passageway</i>
<i> will be revealed.</i>

04:03.911 --> 04:05.777
Here goes.

04:05.779 --> 04:07.846
This is so exciting.

04:13.854 --> 04:17.022
Oh, fiddlesticks.
What is going on?

04:17.024 --> 04:20.559
<i> I'm afraid it is the work</i>
<i> of the fairy teachers,</i>

04:20.561 --> 04:23.195
<i> Flora, Fauna,</i>
<i> and Merriweather.</i>

04:23.197 --> 04:24.863
Aurora's guardians.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.531
<i> They must've put</i>
<i> a protection spell</i>

04:26.533 --> 04:27.966
<i> on the candle.</i>

04:27.968 --> 04:30.035
I'll use my necessi-key.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.671
It can create
a door anywhere.

04:35.809 --> 04:38.110
<i> Not here.</i>

04:38.112 --> 04:41.113
<i> The only way in is to</i>
<i> break the protection spell.</i>

04:41.115 --> 04:42.648
But how?

04:42.650 --> 04:47.452
FAUNA: Yes, wonderful idea to
make dragon fire, Sofia.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.255
The Alchemy book said dragon
fire's the rarest fire of all.

04:50.257 --> 04:52.891
Oh, yes, it is.

04:52.893 --> 04:56.895
And it requires
the rarest ingredient of all.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.897
Lightning spark.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.500
We keep it in here,
should we ever need

05:01.502 --> 05:03.669
to make dragon fire
ourselves.

05:03.671 --> 05:06.138
Here's a small bit
of the spark.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.473
It's all that we have,
but it should be enough.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.409
Thanks, Miss Fauna.

05:13.914 --> 05:17.749
Dragon fire? Maybe that's
the key to breaking
the protection spell.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.919
Why, I think
it just might be.

05:20.921 --> 05:22.821
This is dragon fire ash.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.790
I've seen it on
the Isle of Dragons.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.925
Let's follow the princess.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.860
Then just when
she makes the dragon fire,

05:28.862 --> 05:30.862
we'll snatch it!

05:35.936 --> 05:37.669
Clover, guess what.

05:37.671 --> 05:40.672
I have to find an animal
to help me with
my alchemy class

05:40.674 --> 05:42.941
for the rest
of the school year,
and I choose you.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.110
Yo! That's great news!

05:45.112 --> 05:48.980
Quality Sofia-Clover time,
here we come.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.550
We'll get to do
all this neat magic together.

05:51.552 --> 05:54.553
I'll stir a potion here,
say a magic word or two there.

05:54.555 --> 05:58.957
It might be a bit harder than
that, but that's the right idea.

05:58.959 --> 05:59.725
That sounds fun.

05:59.727 --> 06:01.793
Really,
really fun.

06:01.795 --> 06:05.330
Why can't we be your animal
helpers, huh, Sofia?

06:05.332 --> 06:09.034
Oh, I... didn't think you guys
would be interested.

06:09.036 --> 06:11.837
Sofia, does a bee
make honey?

06:11.839 --> 06:13.171
Does a duck go quack?

06:13.173 --> 06:15.807
What I'm saying is,
we're interested.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.342
Really, really interested.

06:17.344 --> 06:20.212
Okay.
Well, what about this?

06:20.214 --> 06:23.582
Clover, would you mind
if I hold try-outs
for my helper?

06:23.584 --> 06:25.851
It's only fair to give
everyone a chance.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.686
Oh, all right.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.354
- Really?
- Really.

06:29.356 --> 06:31.156
I'm your number one bunny.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.492
I'll ace the audition
and get the gig anyway.

06:33.494 --> 06:35.394
Okay, great.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.662
Everyone, meet in
the gazebo later for try-outs.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.366
( cow mooing,
elephant trumpeting )

06:41.368 --> 06:44.169
( sighs ) Guess word
got out about try-outs.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.937
Yeah, it looks like.

06:45.939 --> 06:49.674
Thank you all for coming to
my animal helper try-outs.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.943
Your support
is much appreciated.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.678
I'm going to
test your skills

06:53.680 --> 06:56.882
as you each help me
make dragon fire.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.483
Clover, you're first.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.621
Don't get too cozy now.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.923
- You won't be here long.
- ( chirps )

07:06.894 --> 07:09.294
- Okay, first,
I add lava paste,
- Uh-huh.

07:09.296 --> 07:12.030
and you add
a scoop of dragon scales,

07:12.032 --> 07:13.799
and a pinch of
hurricane dust.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.901
- Got it.
- Ready? Go!

07:15.903 --> 07:17.869
Okay.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.905
How do I know
which one's dragon scales?

07:19.907 --> 07:22.040
This one looks scaly.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.708
But this one
looks dragon-y.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.544
( Wormwood cawing )

07:25.546 --> 07:28.046
Wormwood, are you
trying out, too?

07:28.048 --> 07:31.550
I just came to see
what the new generation
of animal helpers

07:31.552 --> 07:33.118
has to offer.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.821
Gotta find
the hurricane dust.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.623
Could be this one,
or maybe that.

07:38.625 --> 07:41.960
So far, not so much really.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.695
( cawing )

07:45.966 --> 07:48.400
Clover, I need
those ingredients.

07:48.402 --> 07:50.535
Right, right. Uh...

07:51.472 --> 07:52.838
There.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.473
Ta-da!

07:54.475 --> 07:56.641
Are you sure
you got the right ones?

07:56.643 --> 07:59.110
Of course I'm sure
I got the right ones.

07:59.112 --> 08:01.880
Pretty sure.
Kinda. Ugh.

08:07.855 --> 08:11.122
Look, it's bubbling, Sof.

08:11.124 --> 08:20.932
But wait.
It doesn't say
it's supposed to bu...

08:20.934 --> 08:24.269
Okay, that was
just practice.

08:24.271 --> 08:25.937
Take two.

08:25.939 --> 08:27.506
Hey, what about us?

08:27.508 --> 08:28.773
Don't we get a turn?

08:28.775 --> 08:30.308
I'm sorry, Clover.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.110
I don't think
it's going to work out.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.613
- I should let the other
animals audition.
- But Sof...

08:34.615 --> 08:37.883
Doing well in alchemy class
is really important to me.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.318
( cawing )

08:40.320 --> 08:41.720
Tell you what.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.822
How about I let you
try out again later,

08:43.824 --> 08:46.625
if you take lessons
from Wormwood first?

08:46.627 --> 08:47.692
From Feather Face?

08:47.694 --> 08:48.994
From me?

08:48.996 --> 08:51.897
- I think not.
- Come on, Wormwood.

08:51.899 --> 08:55.066
You've been Mr. Cedric's
helper for such a long time.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.068
You must have tons
of great tips to give Clover.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.803
Please.

08:58.805 --> 09:04.976
Oh, I suppose I could share
a brilliant pointer or two.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.178
All right, all right,
if that's what it takes

09:07.180 --> 09:09.648
to get the helper gig,
I'm in.

09:09.650 --> 09:14.019
So, do I call you
Professor Feather Face?

09:14.021 --> 09:15.921
No, you don't.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.158
That bunny did terribly.

09:20.160 --> 09:24.095
Twitch, you should
try out to be Sofia's helper.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.064
You know so much
about magic,

09:26.066 --> 09:28.567
I know she'll
choose you.

09:28.569 --> 09:31.436
Yeah, then once we make
the dragon fire,

09:31.438 --> 09:34.573
swish, nab, I'll be
right there to steal it.

09:34.575 --> 09:38.043
But wait, Sofia saw you
as a rat in Wei-Ling.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.145
Good point.

09:42.015 --> 09:45.684
Mm, better, but we still
have to hide that.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.624
( laughs )
What a handsome
weasel you are.

09:52.626 --> 09:56.127
Now run along.
Deceive that princess. Shoo.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.231
Now then,
for lesson number one,

10:00.233 --> 10:02.934
I thought we'd start
with something easy.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.542
Memorize each and every
ingredient you'll need

10:10.544 --> 10:12.210
to make dragon fire.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.982
Uh, that's starting
off easy?

10:16.984 --> 10:19.651
It is essential
that an animal helper

10:19.653 --> 10:23.455
be able to identify
ingredients and bring
them to their master

10:23.457 --> 10:25.123
without delay.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.958
Listen carefully.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.593
This is dragon scales,

10:28.595 --> 10:31.096
this, hurricane dust,

10:31.098 --> 10:33.598
and this is lava paste.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.634
Now you try.

10:35.636 --> 10:38.637
Uh, dragon thing-a-whatever,

10:38.639 --> 10:40.171
and hurricane
stuff-a-ma-guff.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.807
No. This is
hurricane stuff-a-ma-guff...

10:42.809 --> 10:44.943
Oh, you've got me
saying it!

10:44.945 --> 10:46.645
Hurricane dust!

10:46.647 --> 10:48.413
Come in,
it's too hard.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.015
I'll never get
all this.

10:50.017 --> 10:54.019
Here. Use this rhyme
to remember.

10:54.021 --> 10:57.155
Dragon scales
are shaped like snails.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.158
Hurricane dust
is red as rust.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.527
Can you start over?

11:02.529 --> 11:04.629
I already forgot
the beginning.

11:04.631 --> 11:07.232
Ahem, star pupil,
you are not.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.001
Okay, Rex,
your turn.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.306
Now please fetch
the dragon scales.

11:15.308 --> 11:18.043
Oh, like a game?
( laughs )

11:18.045 --> 11:19.678
Ready, set, go!

11:24.384 --> 11:26.751
That's right. Wow.
Good job, Rex.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.822
What are you doing?

11:30.824 --> 11:33.892
New game, new game!
Tug-of-war!

11:36.496 --> 11:40.165
Rex, I'm worried about
choosing you as my helper.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.300
You'll just play
games all the time.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.202
Yeah, sure would.
Games, games, games.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.304
Boy, does that sound fun!

11:46.306 --> 11:48.039
( howls )

11:48.041 --> 11:50.275
I'm sorry, Rex,
but it's not going
to work out.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.481
I really hope I find
an animal helper

11:56.483 --> 11:58.216
in time for school
tomorrow.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.251
( sighs )

12:00.253 --> 12:02.020
All right,
who's next?

12:02.022 --> 12:04.189
Try the rhyme again
from the top.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.491
When will it sink
into your bird brain?

12:06.493 --> 12:08.560
There's no way
I can learn all this.

12:08.562 --> 12:12.230
But there is, if you
just focus and repeat after me.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.167
¶ Dragon scales
are shaped like snails ¶

12:16.169 --> 12:17.936
¶ Hurricane dust
is red as rust ¶

12:17.938 --> 12:20.171
¶ Lava paste
has an ashy taste ¶

12:20.173 --> 12:22.240
¶ Dry quicksand crumbles
like pie crust ¶

12:24.211 --> 12:26.344
- ¶ The snails are scaly? ¶
- ¶ The snails are scaly ¶

12:26.346 --> 12:29.080
- ¶ The paste is rusty? ¶
- ¶ No, the dust, see? ¶

12:29.082 --> 12:32.951
¶ It's making me
so headache-y ¶

12:32.953 --> 12:35.286
¶ Learn this rhyme,
it's worth your time ¶

12:35.288 --> 12:37.122
¶ Soon you'll recite it
on a dime ¶

12:37.124 --> 12:39.257
¶ You'll be a helper
most sublime ¶

12:39.259 --> 12:43.628
¶ But only if you get the gist
and learn this rhyme ¶

12:47.534 --> 12:50.268
¶ Hornet wax
won't stain, relax ¶

12:50.270 --> 12:52.237
¶ Mercury mist
drifts in a twist ¶

12:52.239 --> 12:54.305
¶ And this grass,
it's sassafras ¶

12:54.307 --> 12:56.741
¶ Frog slime flips
just like flapjacks ¶

12:56.743 --> 12:59.644
¶ So uh,
the wax is grassy ¶

12:59.646 --> 13:00.745
¶ Let's not get sassy! ¶

13:00.747 --> 13:01.946
¶ The slime is misty? ¶

13:01.948 --> 13:03.782
¶ The mist is twisty ¶

13:03.784 --> 13:07.218
¶ You're making me
so headache-y! ¶

13:07.220 --> 13:09.454
¶ Learn this rhyme,
it's worth your time ¶

13:09.456 --> 13:11.656
¶ Soon you'll recite it
on a dime ¶

13:11.658 --> 13:13.825
¶ You'll be a helper
most sublime ¶

13:13.827 --> 13:17.962
¶ But only if you get the gist
and learn this rhyme ¶

13:17.964 --> 13:19.397
Uh, okay.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.666
Let's see if
I have this straight.

13:22.636 --> 13:24.602
¶ Wax is here
and dust is there ¶

13:24.604 --> 13:26.404
¶ No, wax is there,
you silly hare ¶

13:26.406 --> 13:28.973
¶ Quicksand flips
and frog slime flakes ¶

13:28.975 --> 13:31.009
¶ Frog slime flips,
for goodness sake! ¶

13:31.011 --> 13:32.977
That's it!
Lesson's over!

13:32.979 --> 13:36.414
¶ Because you refuse
to get the gist ¶

13:36.416 --> 13:43.788
¶ And learn this rhyme! ¶

13:43.790 --> 13:46.424
Wait a minute,
Wormwood.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.760
Come on, you can't
quit on me.

13:48.762 --> 13:51.196
How will I learn
to be Sofia's helper?

13:51.198 --> 13:53.865
I suppose someone else
will get the joy

13:53.867 --> 13:55.266
of teaching you.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.768
Who else is there?

13:56.770 --> 13:59.137
Come on, Wormwood.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.606
What am I gonna do now?

14:09.049 --> 14:10.515
That's lava paste, of course,

14:10.517 --> 14:12.283
measured to a T.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.852
You're really
good at this.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.887
You'd make
a great animal helper.

14:15.889 --> 14:18.723
It's just,
I don't really know
you, Mr. Weasel.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.358
I think I'd feel
more comfortable

14:20.360 --> 14:21.893
with someone
I'm already friends with.

14:21.895 --> 14:23.628
But everyone likes me,

14:23.630 --> 14:25.697
and I'm a gem
of an animal helper.

14:25.699 --> 14:28.132
I'm sorry, but no.

14:28.134 --> 14:29.567
Your mistake.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.269
Good luck with
these chumps.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.407
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

14:36.409 --> 14:39.911
How do you know
all that magic ingredient

14:39.913 --> 14:42.347
and animal helper stuff?

14:42.349 --> 14:43.681
Practice, that's how.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.817
Years of practice.

14:45.819 --> 14:47.518
I just wasted
all this time

14:47.520 --> 14:50.021
trying to learn
a really hard
potion-making rhyme.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.690
I need something easier,
and I need it fast.

14:52.692 --> 14:55.393
I was kinda hoping
you could

14:55.395 --> 14:58.529
give me a few
great tips, you know?

14:58.531 --> 15:01.833
You know, it may have taken
me years to learn everything,

15:01.835 --> 15:04.535
but for you,
there may just
be a quicker way.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.204
Where'd you go?

15:06.206 --> 15:09.507
Ha ha, wow!
How did you do that?

15:09.509 --> 15:11.743
Are you magical
or something?

15:11.745 --> 15:13.511
Or something,

15:13.513 --> 15:15.179
and that's the key
to my plan.

15:15.181 --> 15:16.748
I can hide out of sight
at the auditions,

15:16.750 --> 15:19.784
and whisper to you
exactly how to make
the dragon fire.

15:19.786 --> 15:22.020
How will I hear
if you whisper?

15:22.022 --> 15:23.888
I'll stay real close.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.590
Close enough so
I can steal...

15:25.592 --> 15:28.293
so you can hear
everything I say.

15:28.295 --> 15:31.095
Wow, you'd really do that?
Why?

15:31.097 --> 15:33.231
Because I have a hunch
you've got the chops

15:33.233 --> 15:35.233
it takes to be
a great animal helper.

15:35.235 --> 15:36.768
I mean,
really great.

15:36.770 --> 15:39.070
Wow, you really think so?

15:39.072 --> 15:40.972
Thanks. Let's go.

15:42.742 --> 15:44.575
Okay, Clover, now,

15:44.577 --> 15:46.411
I will need
some lava paste.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.646
Lava paste
tastes like...

15:48.648 --> 15:51.082
How'd that rhyme
go again?

15:51.084 --> 15:52.650
Don't hurt your brain
remembering.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.319
It's the last pouch
on the left.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.154
Oh, this?
Here it is.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.755
Last pouch
on the left.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.290
You're welcome.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.792
Now, get the dried
quicksand.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.396
The big pouch.
Chop, chop!

16:05.398 --> 16:07.298
That's it, Clover.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.367
Now all we need
is the lightning spark.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.571
Whoa. Did we do it?!

16:13.573 --> 16:15.340
That's dragon fire,
all right!

16:18.812 --> 16:21.446
Come to me,
dragon fire.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.348
( straining )

16:23.350 --> 16:27.518
It's like a ton of bricks.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.954
Wow, Clover,
you did great.

16:29.956 --> 16:31.656
Lessons with Wormwood
really paid off.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.424
Uh... yeah.

16:33.426 --> 16:36.094
It was... it was
hard work,

16:36.096 --> 16:38.096
but it was worth it.

16:38.098 --> 16:41.099
Sure was.
You can now be my helper.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.367
I can?!

16:42.369 --> 16:44.535
Oh, yeah!

16:44.537 --> 16:46.938
Sofia and Clover,
together again.

16:46.940 --> 16:49.540
Yep, starting with making
dragon fire

16:49.542 --> 16:51.242
for Mr. Merlin
tomorrow.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.546
Hey, buddy,
you're gonna help me

16:55.548 --> 16:57.215
at Sofia's school
tomorrow, right?

16:57.217 --> 16:58.850
You kidding?

16:58.852 --> 17:00.551
I wouldn't miss it for
all the magic in the Ever Realm.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.487
Twitch.

17:02.489 --> 17:04.022
What happened?

17:04.024 --> 17:05.490
A little glitch
in my plan,

17:05.492 --> 17:07.025
but don't worry.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.860
I'll get
the dragon fire tomorrow.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.528
You can count on
this wicked chameleon.

17:14.234 --> 17:16.300
A delightful demonstration

17:16.302 --> 17:19.037
of the tornado potion,
Prince Desmond.

17:19.039 --> 17:22.573
Kudos to you
and your animal helper.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.711
Uh...

17:31.351 --> 17:34.018
Colorificus change-o!

17:34.020 --> 17:37.021
Most well done,
Princess Hildegard.

17:37.023 --> 17:39.824
You and your
animal helper!

17:39.826 --> 17:41.692
Thank you, Mr. Merlin.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.828
Next up,
Princess Sofia.

17:43.830 --> 17:46.597
Okay, here we go.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.402
And what will you
be attempting today?

17:51.404 --> 17:53.571
My animal helper
Clover and I

17:53.573 --> 17:56.507
will try to make
dragon fire.

17:56.509 --> 17:58.709
MERLIN: Very complicated,
but impressive.

17:58.711 --> 18:00.912
I hope so.
Ready?

18:00.914 --> 18:03.214
Let's get cookin'.

18:03.216 --> 18:05.083
Now, you get
the dragon scales.

18:05.085 --> 18:06.684
Dragon scales
are shaped like--

18:06.686 --> 18:08.753
Forget the rhyme.
Just take this pouch here.

18:08.755 --> 18:09.887
Yeah, right.

18:09.889 --> 18:12.223
Good. Now
the hurricane dust.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.424
Right away.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.293
This red pouch,
but not too much.

18:15.295 --> 18:17.495
Good job, Clover.

18:19.966 --> 18:22.233
Purple smoke.
We're almost there.

18:22.235 --> 18:25.103
Now, the most important
ingredient of all.

18:25.105 --> 18:27.004
Lightning spark.

18:32.645 --> 18:33.945
We did it!

18:33.947 --> 18:35.746
- Yes!
- Yes!

18:35.748 --> 18:37.482
Just brilliant.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.484
Literally.

18:40.920 --> 18:43.721
- Hey!
- Oh, no!

18:43.723 --> 18:46.224
Swirling sorcery,
what just happened?

18:46.226 --> 18:47.959
Uh, I don't know,
but don't worry.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.694
I'll find out.

18:52.098 --> 18:53.097
There it is.

18:53.099 --> 18:55.733
Told ya I wouldn't
let you down.

18:55.735 --> 18:57.802
This is no time
to brag. Hurry!

19:05.612 --> 19:08.513
To the spindle.
Nothin' can stop us.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.748
Then it will be
one Wicked Nine down

19:10.750 --> 19:12.150
and eight more
to go.

19:15.755 --> 19:18.022
Wait! Open up!

19:18.024 --> 19:20.591
Oh, that was Prisma.

19:20.593 --> 19:23.094
She's after one of
the Wicked Nine.
I heard her.

19:23.096 --> 19:24.996
The bird was
working with her.

19:24.998 --> 19:27.165
( gasps ) It had
a diamond patch

19:27.167 --> 19:29.033
just like the rat
in Wei-Ling.

19:29.035 --> 19:31.002
What was that bird
doing in class anyway?

19:31.004 --> 19:32.770
Clover?

19:32.772 --> 19:34.372
You know something.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.540
You have to tell me.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.675
Okay, fine.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.211
He was hiding and
whispering to me how
to make the dragon fire.

19:40.213 --> 19:43.381
Why? You said lessons with
Wormwood went great.

19:43.383 --> 19:45.950
It was too hard
to remember everything,

19:45.952 --> 19:48.386
- so I had to take
a shortcut.
- You were cheating?

19:48.388 --> 19:50.855
I just wanted
to spend more time with you.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.391
But I know it was
sneaky and wrong.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.660
I'm really, really
sorry, Sof.

19:55.662 --> 19:58.162
They must've needed
the dragon fire

19:58.164 --> 19:59.830
to open
the secret passage.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.232
How are we
going to stop them?

20:01.234 --> 20:02.633
Can't you just
make more?

20:02.635 --> 20:05.236
I can, but I can't
do it alone.

20:05.238 --> 20:06.737
Don't look at me.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.673
All I know how to do
is mess things up.

20:08.675 --> 20:10.241
Come on, Clover.

20:10.243 --> 20:11.809
Wormwood must've
taught you something.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.845
Dragon scales are
shaped like... d-oh!

20:14.847 --> 20:17.215
I don't remember.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.916
You can do it.
Think.

20:18.918 --> 20:22.220
Dragon scales
are shaped like...

20:22.222 --> 20:23.688
snails!

20:23.690 --> 20:26.157
And hurricane dust
is red as rust!

20:26.159 --> 20:27.658
That's it, Clover.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.765
Locket, the spinning
wheel's not here.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.734
Just this... organ?

20:36.736 --> 20:40.238
<i> I see it</i>
<i> behind the wall.</i>

20:40.240 --> 20:43.374
<i> But it is guarded by</i>
<i> another protection.</i>

20:43.376 --> 20:44.609
Another one?

20:44.611 --> 20:47.178
Oh!

20:47.180 --> 20:48.279
( keys play )

20:52.185 --> 20:53.784
( gasps ) We must have
to play a certain tune

20:53.786 --> 20:55.620
to get to
the hidden spindle.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.730
We have dragon fire.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.798
Good job, Clover.

21:15.642 --> 21:18.242
Twitch,
play that again.

21:18.244 --> 21:20.044
Again!

21:41.334 --> 21:43.434
Oh, the spindle!

21:43.436 --> 21:45.469
I've got it!

21:45.471 --> 21:47.471
Now give it
to us, Prisma.

21:47.473 --> 21:50.107
Ugh. Princess Sofia.

21:50.109 --> 21:52.410
Why would we ever
give it to you?

21:52.412 --> 21:55.579
Because otherwise,
we'll have to take it.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.817
- Give it.
- Toss it here.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.185
No!

22:01.187 --> 22:03.421
Clover, get the spindle.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.690
- Twitch, you get
the spindle.
- ( screeches )

22:20.773 --> 22:23.441
- Got it, Sof.
- Take it to
the fairies quick.

22:26.612 --> 22:27.778
PRISMA: No!

22:27.780 --> 22:30.948
The only way out of here
is through the fairies' office.

22:30.950 --> 22:33.951
Don't be so sure, Sofia.

22:33.953 --> 22:36.053
- Remember this?
- The necessi-key.

22:36.055 --> 22:39.557
No one can catch me,
least of all you, princess.

22:39.559 --> 22:41.726
Come along, Twitch.

22:47.900 --> 22:50.534
I can't believe
they got away, Sof.

22:50.536 --> 22:52.169
Well, at least they
didn't get the spindle,

22:52.171 --> 22:54.038
thanks to you, Clover.

22:56.676 --> 22:59.310
Children, I would like
to compliment all of you

22:59.312 --> 23:01.879
on your wondrously
wonderful displays

23:01.881 --> 23:03.547
of advanced alchemy.

23:03.549 --> 23:06.550
And we have
a special prize

23:06.552 --> 23:08.986
for the most wonderful
alchemist

23:08.988 --> 23:11.055
and her wondrous
animal helper--

23:11.057 --> 23:14.258
Princess Sofia
and Clover!
