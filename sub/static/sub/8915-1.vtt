(# "How High the Moon" by Pat Suzuki)

00:27.400 --> 00:34.590
# Somewhere there's music

00:34.720 --> 00:41.478
# How faint the tune

00:42.880 --> 00:49.399
# Somewhere there's heaven

00:49.520 --> 00:56.790
# How high the moon

00:57.720 --> 01:02.919
# There is no moon above

01:03.040 --> 01:11.869
# When love is far away, too

01:12.000 --> 01:18.075
# Till it comes true

01:18.200 --> 01:22.557
# That you love me

01:22.680 --> 01:25.831
# As I love you

01:26.720 --> 01:32.590
# Somewhere there's music

01:33.640 --> 01:40.398
# It's where you are

01:40.960 --> 01:47.354
# Somewhere there's heaven

01:48.320 --> 01:54.953
# How near, how far

01:56.200 --> 02:00.751
# The darkest night would shine

02:00.880 --> 02:08.309
# If you would come to me soon

02:09.039 --> 02:13.318
# Until you will

02:13.440 --> 02:16.989
# How still my heart

02:19.000 --> 02:22.276
# How high the moon...

02:24.960 --> 02:28.714
I don't think much about the big war any
more, the one called "the second one"...

02:28.840 --> 02:33.868
..because the small wars that came after it
seem bigger now than the big war was.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.834
Most people today look back at
the big one with sort of fond memories.

02:37.960 --> 02:39.712
It was, in a sense, an OK war.

02:39.840 --> 02:44.391
We knew why we were fighting it and felt
pretty proud of ourselves for being in it.

02:44.520 --> 02:47.114
We liked the songs,
we liked the uniforms,...

02:47.240 --> 02:50.516
.. we liked the girls
and we liked that everyone liked us.

02:50.640 --> 02:53.393
So, looking back,
it was one ofyour better wars,...

02:53.520 --> 02:57.274
..except ifyou were a year out of high
school heading south in a troop train,...

02:57.400 --> 03:00.710
..knowing in two months you'd be
in a mudhole fighting for your life.

03:08.320 --> 03:12.598
We were in a filthy train heading
for basic training in Biloxi, Mississippi,...

03:12.720 --> 03:15.871
..and on the entire trip
in the train nobody washed.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.434
We were preparing
to fight Germany andJapan,...

03:18.560 --> 03:21.313
..but instead we were stinking up America.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.710
(spitting)

03:40.200 --> 03:43.795
- Hey, what the hell's with you?
- You talkin' to me, garbage face?

03:43.920 --> 03:46.878
- Yeah, pisshead!
- Who you callin' pisshead, jerk-off?

03:47.000 --> 03:49.150
Knock it off, shit brains!

03:50.480 --> 03:53.119
Up your keister
with a meat hook, Wykowski.

03:54.880 --> 03:58.270
It was my fifth day in the army,
and so far I hated everyone.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.756
(whistle blows)

04:09.560 --> 04:11.994
Where the hell are we anyway?

04:12.120 --> 04:14.793
Hey, Shakespeare, where the hell are we?

04:15.440 --> 04:16.998
West virginia.

04:17.120 --> 04:19.076
No shit. Where's that near?

04:20.399 --> 04:25.076
You don't know where West virginia is?
Didn't you ever take geography?

04:25.200 --> 04:27.156
I was sick that day.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.749
Hey! Hey, what's for chow?

04:34.880 --> 04:37.269
Turkey breasts and white wine.

04:37.400 --> 04:40.358
- In a pig's ass.
- Right, that's how they serve it.

04:45.760 --> 04:49.958
You better eat, guys, cos it ain't
gonna be this good in Mississippi.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.275
Joseph Wykowski from Bridgeport,
Connecticut, had the stomach of a goat.

04:56.400 --> 05:01.394
He could eat anything. His favourite was
Hershey bars with the wrappers still on.

05:01.520 --> 05:03.954
Arnold Epstein,
an intellectual from New York,...

05:04.080 --> 05:06.674
.. was my only hope
for intelligent conversation.

05:06.800 --> 05:11.430
Hey, Arnold, if I wanted to become
a writer, who do you recommend I read?

05:11.560 --> 05:14.597
The entire third floor of
the New York Public Library.

05:14.720 --> 05:18.235
Hey, Epstein, you wanna
read somethin', huh? Read this!

05:26.080 --> 05:30.676
It was hard to believe they had mothers
and fathers who were worried about them.

05:41.800 --> 05:46.510
# Pardon me, boy,
is that the Chattanooga Choo-Choo?

05:46.640 --> 05:48.835
# Track 29

05:48.960 --> 05:51.918
# Boy, you can give me a shine

05:53.320 --> 05:55.470
- # Can you afford to board
- Shut him up!

05:55.600 --> 05:58.319
# The Chattanooga Choo-Choo

05:58.440 --> 06:01.273
- # I've got my fare...
- Wake him up, for Christ's sake.

06:01.400 --> 06:04.870
- Oh! What the hell is wrong with you?
- It's 2.30 in the goddamn morning!

06:05.000 --> 06:07.036
- You were singin' again.
- I was not!

06:07.160 --> 06:09.230
You practically made a record.

06:09.360 --> 06:12.079
- What was I singing?
- # Chattanooga Choo-Choo

06:12.200 --> 06:15.954
"Chattanooga Choo-Choo"? I don't
even know "Chattanooga Choo-Choo".

06:16.080 --> 06:18.116
Whoa! Goddammit!

06:18.240 --> 06:21.198
- Somebody let go!
- Oh! Hey, was it you, Carney?

06:21.320 --> 06:25.199
- I'm not gonna do that when I'm singing!
- Maybe you sang to cover it up.

06:25.320 --> 06:29.279
Hey, Jerome, write this in your diary:
"Major fart in West virginia."

06:29.400 --> 06:31.914
Wait a minute. It's comin' from up there.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.315
Hey, bombardier.

06:34.440 --> 06:37.512
- Kill Germans, not Gls.
- Oh, brother.

06:37.640 --> 06:42.839
- I'm sorry. I'm not feeling very well.
- Well, now we're all not feeling very well.

06:42.960 --> 06:45.235
Does anyone have an Alka-Seltzer tablet?

06:45.360 --> 06:47.920
Pluggin' it up ain't gonna help, Epstein.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.195
(announcements over loudspeaker)

07:21.400 --> 07:24.278
Boy, it's hot. This is hot.

07:24.400 --> 07:28.473
Find your company. Company letters
are over the door. Form a single line.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.319
Be prepared to give your name
to the men at the desk.

07:32.920 --> 07:36.037
(man) What the hell you think you're
lookin' at? You just dig. You don't stop.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.076
Where are you guys from?

07:40.200 --> 07:43.670
- Fort Dix, New Jersey. What's it like?
- It's real rough.

07:43.800 --> 07:47.759
We've been here a week. Ten guys died
from malaria. We're buryin' em in here.

07:47.880 --> 07:51.111
- Are you serious?
- He's full of shit. It's a drainage ditch.

07:51.240 --> 07:54.550
I didn't know it was gonna be this hot.
This is really hot.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.671
Hey, watch out for the pole!

07:59.600 --> 08:03.309
Jesus! Did you see that?
That pole just went down. Whack.

08:03.440 --> 08:07.115
Everything falls here.
Telephone poles, flagpoles.

08:07.240 --> 08:09.708
Bugs eat 'em.
Pretty soon we're all gonna go.

08:10.680 --> 08:13.240
Never got this hot in Brooklyn.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.510
This is like Africa hot.

08:15.640 --> 08:18.438
Tarzan couldn't take this kinda hot.

08:21.680 --> 08:24.240
Better get a shine on those shoes, rookie.

08:27.080 --> 08:30.038
I think they've taken us
to a German prison camp.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.356
Detail, halt!

08:35.159 --> 08:38.835
You men fall out and fall in on me.
Column of twos, down here.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.350
This platoon is assigned to this barracks.

08:46.480 --> 08:49.552
Remain here until further instructions
from your sergeant.

08:49.680 --> 08:54.276
You will remain on your feet. No smokin'
and no goddamn tobacco-chewin'.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.356
At ease.

08:57.160 --> 08:59.469
He must think we're stagecoach drivers.

08:59.600 --> 09:02.068
Shut your ass.
These non-coms hear everything.

09:02.200 --> 09:06.318
Perfect. It only took the army five minutes
to turn Wykowski into a robot.

09:06.440 --> 09:09.591
Jesus, I'm dripping wet.
This place is like a steam bath.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.756
I can't stay if it's gonna be this hot.

09:11.880 --> 09:15.316
- I shoulda joined the navy. It's cooler.
- Navy's for homos.

09:15.440 --> 09:20.116
I pictured the army different. I pictured
a lotta doughnuts and USO dances.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.593
Hi.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.676
How are ya?

09:31.040 --> 09:32.996
Good to see ya.

09:35.960 --> 09:37.313
- Hello, soldier.
- Hello.

09:37.440 --> 09:39.396
Hi, sarge.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.276
Hm.

09:44.440 --> 09:46.396
Detail, attention.

09:51.840 --> 09:54.274
Sorry, men,
perhaps I didn't make myself clear.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.356
Detail, ten hut!

09:57.680 --> 10:00.399
Good. Good. At ease, gentlemen.

10:03.120 --> 10:08.399
My name is Toomey. Sergeant Merwin
J Toomey. I'm in charge of this platoon...

10:08.520 --> 10:12.957
..during your ten weeks of basic training
here in beautiful Biloxi, Mississippi.

10:13.080 --> 10:16.311
After which, you'll be sent to
some shit island in the Pacific...

10:16.440 --> 10:19.750
..or some turd pile in Northern Sicily.

10:19.880 --> 10:23.953
In either case, returning to your
mamas and papas with your balls intact...

10:24.080 --> 10:26.036
..is highly improbable.

10:26.160 --> 10:29.357
I speak from experience,
having served 14 months...

10:33.240 --> 10:37.438
..having donated a small portion
of my brains to this conflict,...

10:37.560 --> 10:41.838
..the other portion being protected
by a heavy steel plate in my head.

10:45.360 --> 10:50.036
I'd like you to answer when your name is
called. The answer to the question is "ho".

10:50.160 --> 10:54.358
Not "yes", not "right",
not "here", not 'sir".

10:54.480 --> 10:58.598
Any other unacceptable form of reply,
except the aforementioned "ho".

10:58.720 --> 11:00.073
Am I understood?

11:00.200 --> 11:02.919
(various utterances of "ho")

11:03.040 --> 11:05.076
- Peek, David P.
- Ho.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.792
- Hennesey, James J.
- Ho.

11:06.920 --> 11:08.911
- Wykowski, Joseph T.
- Ho.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.235
- Selridge, Roy W.
- Ho.

11:11.360 --> 11:12.998
- Carney, Donald J.
- Ho.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.475
- Jerome, Eugene M.
- Ho.

11:15.600 --> 11:18.273
- Epstein, Arnold B.
- Ho, ho.

11:26.440 --> 11:29.671
- Are there two Epsteins in this company?
- No, Sergeant.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.268
- Just gimme one goddamn "ho".
- Yes, Sergeant.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.311
- Epstein, Arnold B.
- Ho.

11:34.440 --> 11:36.032
- One more time.
- Ho.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.355
- Do I make myself clear, Epstein?
- Ho.

11:41.480 --> 11:44.074
- Do I make myself clear, Jerome?
- Ho, yes.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.156
- Ho, what?
- Ho, nothing.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.231
- You havin' trouble understanding me?
- Ho, no.

11:50.360 --> 11:52.874
I mean, no, ho, Sergeant.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.956
It's just plain ho.

11:55.560 --> 11:58.438
Hey, Fred Astaire,
you tryin' to tell me somethin'?

11:58.560 --> 12:00.994
I have to go to the bathroom, Sergeant.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.908
How you gonna do that?
We don't have bathrooms in the army.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.395
- They had them in Fort Dix.
- Not bathrooms.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.272
Yes, they did. I went in them a lot.

12:09.400 --> 12:12.358
I'm tellin' you, we don't have
any bathrooms on this base.

12:12.480 --> 12:15.711
- You doubt my veracity?
- No, Sergeant.

12:15.840 --> 12:18.149
- Then you got a problem, haven't you?
- Ho, ho.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.872
You bet your ass, ho, ho.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.072
- You know why you got a problem?
- Cos I have to go real bad.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.670
No, son, you got a problem
because you don't know army terminology.

12:26.800 --> 12:30.110
The place where a US soldier
goes to defecate, relieve himself,...

12:30.240 --> 12:35.075
..open his bowels, shit, fart, dump,
crap and unload is called a latrine.

12:35.200 --> 12:37.555
- Latrine. From the French.
- (laughs)

12:39.760 --> 12:42.354
Wanna tell us
what's funny about that, Jerome?

12:42.480 --> 12:45.950
It's just that you said all those words
in one sentence, Sergeant.

12:46.080 --> 12:50.198
Apparently, you don't understand
the benefit of discipline. Do you, Jerome?

12:50.320 --> 12:52.117
The benefit? Yes, I think I do.

12:52.240 --> 12:55.630
Then tell it to me, Jerome.
What is the benefit of discipline?

12:55.760 --> 12:59.435
Well, it's to benefit the army's, uh,...

12:59.560 --> 13:04.076
..to the way that soldiers...
to... whatever you say, Sergeant.

13:04.960 --> 13:08.509
- Lookin' to get your ass in a sling?
- No, Sergeant. It's fine the way it is.

13:08.640 --> 13:11.950
The benefit of discipline
is that it will win this war for us.

13:12.080 --> 13:16.119
Therefore, until you learn that fact,
I'll just have to keep teachin' it to you.

13:16.240 --> 13:20.074
- Selridge, 100 push-ups. Hit the deck.
- Me? I didn't say nothing.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.192
Correct. We're doin' this
to teach Jerome about discipline.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.675
On your face, soldier!

13:25.800 --> 13:28.473
You think you get
my meaning now about discipline?

13:28.600 --> 13:30.989
- Oh, yes, ho!
- Then let's try it out.

13:31.120 --> 13:34.715
I want another man to give me
100 push-ups. I want you to pick him.

13:34.840 --> 13:37.149
Who will it be, boy?

13:37.280 --> 13:42.400
Speak up, Jerome. Tell me the name of the
man you think's most lacking in discipline.

13:43.760 --> 13:48.151
Well, we just met on the train, Sergeant.
I don't even know all their names yet.

13:48.280 --> 13:52.637
I understand your reticence to speak. No
one's gonna like hearin' his name called.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.115
Why don't you just whisper it in my ear?

13:56.520 --> 13:59.717
Wykowski?
He's the biggest man in the company.

13:59.840 --> 14:04.994
That took guts, Jerome, but if that's
your wish, your wish will be obeyed.

14:05.120 --> 14:08.351
Wykowski, 100 push-ups for me
and your buddy here. Hit the deck.

14:08.480 --> 14:12.758
Now who can we pick to join these men
as a show of comradeship?

14:12.880 --> 14:15.235
Whisper it to me, Jerome.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.197
The entire platoon except yourself.

14:19.320 --> 14:24.474
By God, that's a good choice. You won't
have many friends, but I'll be one of them.

14:25.320 --> 14:27.629
Tell 'em to hit the deck for ya.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.558
- What, you want me to say it?
- It was your idea.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.358
- Platoon, hit the deck.
- Shout it, boy!

14:37.480 --> 14:39.914
- Platoon, hit the deck!
- Tell 'em what we want!

14:40.040 --> 14:43.316
- 100 push-ups!
- Man asked for 150 push-ups!

14:43.440 --> 14:45.749
You heard him, men. Now count off!

14:46.600 --> 14:50.388
(in unison) One, two, three, four,...

14:50.560 --> 14:54.314
..five, six, seven, eight,...

14:54.440 --> 14:58.149
..nine, ten, eleven, twelve,...

14:58.280 --> 15:01.955
..thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,...

15:02.080 --> 15:05.834
..seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty...

15:07.000 --> 15:08.672
(groaning and coughing)

15:09.920 --> 15:12.673
Watch out! Let me through!

15:12.800 --> 15:14.756
Ah! Heads up!

15:19.480 --> 15:23.871
If this keeps up, we'll lose this war.
They'll be speaking German in Chicago.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.389
(soldier) We could all
go on sick call tomorrow.

15:26.840 --> 15:31.072
You don't go on sick call with this guy
unless a tank runs over you.

15:31.200 --> 15:34.715
- Jesus, this thing's a slingshot.
- Is this bunk taken?

15:34.840 --> 15:38.913
Oh, no. I don't mind dyin',
but I don't wanna get my nose blown off.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.236
Hooray, hooray.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.717
Oh, what could I do?
I could be shot for disobeying orders.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.956
You musta done somethin' to piss him off.

15:55.080 --> 15:58.231
Nothing, I swear. He's nuts.

15:58.360 --> 16:00.999
Maybe the humidity rusted his brain.

16:01.120 --> 16:05.193
Yeah, that's a good choice, Jerome. I'd
like to walk in my sleep with a bayonet.

16:05.320 --> 16:08.835
I have a curvature of the spine.
I can't sleep on this thing.

16:08.960 --> 16:12.714
- The heat is getting hotter.
- You girls from the big city can't take it?

16:12.840 --> 16:15.991
- I can take whatever you can take.
- (bugle)

16:16.120 --> 16:20.318
- Don't tell me they're shippin' us out!
- That's chow time.

16:20.440 --> 16:23.193
Chow time. Wash up,
change and let's move.

16:24.560 --> 16:28.473
Maybe there's a place around here
where we could eat out.

16:35.520 --> 16:39.593
It's not bad. It just needs salt and pepper,
ketchup and mustard. That's all.

16:39.720 --> 16:43.599
If they dropped this over Germany, the
country'd come out with their hands up.

16:43.720 --> 16:48.475
I saw this stuff in the Bronx Zoo once.
Gorillas were throwing it at each other.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.433
You can get something else.
It's a government regulation.

16:51.560 --> 16:54.154
Enlisted men must be
served palatable food.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.875
So why don't you ask for
some matzo-ball soup, Epstein?

16:58.000 --> 17:00.389
I hear the army makes
great matzo-ball soup.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.080
It's my right to speak up.
I'm seeing the sergeant.

17:03.200 --> 17:07.590
Don't start in with him, Arnold.
He's crazy. This is probably his recipe.

17:07.720 --> 17:10.075
- Hey.
- How ya doin'?

17:12.760 --> 17:14.796
(Eugene) He's here for his cup of blood.

17:15.079 --> 17:17.195
Listen, you two guys,...

17:17.319 --> 17:21.790
..don't give the sergeant any crap cos
when he don't like you he don't like us.

17:21.920 --> 17:25.390
Any guy that screws up in this platoon
is in deep shit with me, understand?

17:25.520 --> 17:29.274
- Who made you lieutenant colonel?
- I did. I promoted myself.

17:29.400 --> 17:33.552
If I have to do more push-ups cos of you,
Jerome, you're gonna be underneath me.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.911
Well, now we know who the fruits are.

17:37.040 --> 17:40.191
Hey, did you guys hear
what happened over at Baker Company?

17:40.320 --> 17:44.632
Some guy went nuts. Said he was goin'
home, he didn't want no part of this army.

17:44.760 --> 17:48.116
An officer tried to stop him
and the kid belted him one.

17:48.240 --> 17:51.038
The guy's sure to get
five to ten years in Leavenworth.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.515
I thought this was Leavenworth.

17:54.520 --> 17:56.875
- How are my boys doin'?
- First-rate, sarge.

17:57.000 --> 18:01.278
- Surprisingly interesting food, sarge.
- They don't give you enough.

18:01.400 --> 18:02.753
Not hungry, Epstein?

18:02.880 --> 18:05.872
I find enough nourishment
in bread and water, Sergeant.

18:06.000 --> 18:10.198
You'll need plenty of nourishment
with ten backbreakin' weeks ahead of ya.

18:10.320 --> 18:14.313
- Starting at 5am, we're goin' on a hike.
- 5am?

18:14.440 --> 18:18.399
You'll love it. Nothin' like seein' the sun
come up over a Mississippi swamp.

18:18.520 --> 18:22.035
You boys arrived here a day late
and I got to make up that time.

18:22.160 --> 18:25.277
It's a reasonable request
to make, isn't it? Jerome?

18:25.880 --> 18:31.113
Well, we sort of elected Wykowski our
leader. I think that he oughta answer that.

18:31.240 --> 18:35.279
- Is that right, Wykowski?
- I don't question orders, I follow them.

18:35.400 --> 18:38.278
Good answer. A chickenshit one,
but it's a good answer.

18:38.400 --> 18:41.358
How about you, Epstein?
Are you up? 15-mile walk?

18:42.840 --> 18:45.195
- No, Sergeant.
- No?!

18:47.040 --> 18:49.793
Epstein's not up to it, men.
Why is that, Epstein?

18:49.920 --> 18:52.673
We've been on a train
for three days and three nights.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.997
We haven't had one good night's sleep
since we left Fort Dix.

18:56.120 --> 18:59.157
I see. OK. Fair enough.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.555
Epstein, you're excused from the hike.

19:01.680 --> 19:04.672
- Thank you, Sergeant.
- Get a good night's sleep...

19:04.800 --> 19:10.318
..as soon as you've washed and scrubbed
every john, urinal and basin in the latrine.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.159
If it doesn't sparkle when we get back,...

19:13.280 --> 19:16.033
..Wykowski and Selridge
are gonna do 200 push-ups.

19:16.160 --> 19:19.391
That'll put you in good
with the boys, Epstein.

19:20.400 --> 19:24.359
I'll see the rest of you men at 4.30am.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.069
Mm!

19:30.200 --> 19:32.350
Enjoy your meal now, you hear?

19:34.320 --> 19:37.278
- "Enjoy your meal now, you hear?"
- (laughter)

19:37.400 --> 19:41.109
That's good. Hominy pigs
and black-pea eyeballs.

19:41.240 --> 19:43.196
I've got to make you men strong...

19:43.320 --> 19:48.348
..because tonight we're going to march
the entire platoon off of a 3,000ft cliff.

19:49.160 --> 19:50.912
Dying makes a man out of you.

19:51.040 --> 19:56.034
I died in the war. They had me cremated.
The ashes were buried here in my head.

19:56.160 --> 19:59.596
- You think it's funny, Jerome?
- No, I think you're funny, Wykowski.

19:59.720 --> 20:02.075
You forgot to eat the aluminum tray.

20:03.360 --> 20:05.078
Come on, sit down.

20:05.200 --> 20:07.156
Get off!

20:07.760 --> 20:11.719
I got three enemies now, Jerome.
The Japs, the Germans and you!

20:14.080 --> 20:17.072
I wasn't in on that Pearl Harbor thing.

20:17.200 --> 20:18.553
Ha-ha.

20:19.720 --> 20:23.269
Hold it. You still got
two spoonfuls left there, soldier.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.958
I've had enough, Corporal.

20:25.080 --> 20:30.029
You take what you want, but you eat what
you take. We don't waste food here. Eat it.

20:34.720 --> 20:38.395
I believe the corporal said no one
leaves here till the trays are empty.

20:38.520 --> 20:41.751
I want all trays extended
for inspection. Move it.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.438
OK.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.358
OK.

20:46.960 --> 20:48.518
OK.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.678
OK.

20:51.120 --> 20:55.830
- Somethin' wrong with your meal?
- Yes. It's the first food I was afraid of.

20:55.960 --> 21:01.159
You'll like it a month from now cos that's
how long you'll sit here. Back to your seat.

21:02.560 --> 21:04.790
Don't approve of our cuisine, Jerome?

21:04.920 --> 21:09.038
It's not that, Sergeant.
It's a religious objection.

21:09.160 --> 21:11.720
This is the week that
my people fast for two days.

21:11.840 --> 21:15.196
This is July, Jerome. Rosh Hashanah
and Yom Kippur are in September.

21:15.320 --> 21:20.269
I have an all-religious calendar in my
barracks room. Don't try that shit on me.

21:21.160 --> 21:23.230
It's a different holiday.

21:23.360 --> 21:26.716
- It's called EI Malagueña.
- EI Malagueña?

21:26.840 --> 21:28.796
It's for Spanish Jews.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.389
Carney, bring your food.

21:32.520 --> 21:34.715
Come on.

21:34.840 --> 21:38.276
- Put half your food onto Jerome's tray.
- Yes, Sergeant.

21:38.400 --> 21:42.234
Eat in good health, Jerome,
and happy EI Malagueña to you.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.351
Come on.

21:44.480 --> 21:48.712
What's your story, Epstein?
Don't tell me. Today is La Cucaracha.

21:48.840 --> 21:53.038
I have a digestive disorder. It's
commonly known as a nervous stomach.

21:53.160 --> 21:57.836
I have a letter from my internist
at Mount Sinai Hospital on Fifth Avenue.

21:57.960 --> 22:03.671
You see, the trouble is you're not on Fifth
Avenue now. You're in Biloxi, Mississippi.

22:03.800 --> 22:07.793
Corporal, make sure that Private Epstein
finishes everything on his tray,...

22:07.920 --> 22:10.878
- ..including that letter. Hm?
- Yes, Sergeant.

22:27.200 --> 22:30.476
(Sergeant Toomey) Come on,
move your ass. Come on.

22:30.600 --> 22:34.115
- Move it! Come on, move it up!
- Goddamn bugs!

22:34.240 --> 22:37.232
Why don't they bite each other?
They have more blood than us.

22:37.360 --> 22:40.113
- (squawking)
- Jesus Christ, what was that?

22:41.400 --> 22:43.356
Sergeant Toomey giggling.

22:44.760 --> 22:48.639
Oh, God, you are pitiful!
You're embarrassing me...

22:48.760 --> 22:51.513
..in front of the lizards and the buzzards.

22:52.560 --> 22:54.710
Bunch of lard-asses I got here.

22:54.840 --> 22:58.435
What would you do
if the Japanese army was behind ya?

22:58.960 --> 23:01.713
Surrender and get some sleep.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.991
Shut your ass, Jerome.
I ain't doin' no push-ups in a swamp!

23:05.120 --> 23:09.079
Yeah, lucky Epstein, back in a nice,
dry latrine listening to Jack Benny.

23:09.200 --> 23:11.668
- Whoo!
- Come on, move it out.

23:13.080 --> 23:16.038
Oh, please, God, please let
there be a subway near here.

23:16.160 --> 23:18.037
Come on.

23:18.160 --> 23:20.754
- Get your elbow outta my ass, asshole.
- Shit.

23:20.880 --> 23:23.235
- Watch your damn gun.
- Hey, watch it.

23:27.760 --> 23:30.718
Did I say stop? Who stopped this march?

23:30.840 --> 23:32.592
Goddammit.

23:37.040 --> 23:40.874
- Did you hear me call halt, Pinelli?
- No, sarge.

23:41.000 --> 23:43.514
- But that looks like pretty deep water.
- No shit!

23:43.640 --> 23:45.596
What does that mean? Selridge?

23:47.000 --> 23:51.391
Well, it means that...
that looks like pretty deep water.

23:51.520 --> 23:55.354
Selridge, you would need three promotions
to get to be an asshole.

23:55.480 --> 23:59.473
Wykowski, how we gonna get
to the other side of that obstacle?

23:59.600 --> 24:02.672
Well, either someone goes in
and sees how deep it is,...

24:02.800 --> 24:05.439
..or we keep lookin' for
another place to cross.

24:05.560 --> 24:08.552
That's smart. You must have been
in the First World War.

24:08.680 --> 24:13.629
All right. We need a volunteer
to see just how deep that water is.

24:15.640 --> 24:17.198
Jerome?

24:17.320 --> 24:19.276
Yes, Sergeant?

24:20.520 --> 24:23.671
- Pick a volunteer.
- Oh! No.

24:24.680 --> 24:25.829
Why me?

24:25.960 --> 24:29.236
Because you said "Let's surrender
so I can get some sleep."

24:29.360 --> 24:32.909
I hear everything, everyone, Jerome.
Pick a volunteer.

24:36.440 --> 24:39.512
- All right, me. I'll do it.
- You don't get off that easy, boy.

24:39.640 --> 24:41.596
Pick a volunteer!

24:42.360 --> 24:43.918
How about Epstein?

24:44.040 --> 24:47.077
I guess you're gonna have
to whisper it to me again.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.553
Wykowski.

24:48.680 --> 24:51.956
You must like him. You pick him
for every shit detail, don't you?

24:52.080 --> 24:55.231
You heard him, Wykowski. Into the water.

24:59.400 --> 25:02.676
Those funny New York remarks
are making you real popular, Jerome.

25:05.280 --> 25:06.633
Whoa!

25:08.480 --> 25:13.429
Guess we have to find another way round.
Selridge, Carney, pull Wykowski out.

25:13.560 --> 25:16.074
It was then I decided
I had to get out of the army.

25:16.200 --> 25:21.433
I thought of shooting off a body part
I might not need, but I couldn"t find any.

25:21.560 --> 25:24.120
- Right face.
- (laughter)

25:24.240 --> 25:26.834
Platoon, left face.
Turn with the rest of "em.

25:26.960 --> 25:30.236
- The guy hit me.
- Well, turn with the rest of "em.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.316
Pick it up.

25:33.440 --> 25:34.793
Right face.

25:34.920 --> 25:38.469
- (laughter)
- Oh, come on. Quickly.

25:38.600 --> 25:41.717
Pick up the gun! Do as you're told.
Turn with the rest of 'em.

25:41.840 --> 25:46.868
Left shoulder arms! Right shoulder arms!
Left shoulder arms! Right shoulder arms!

25:47.000 --> 25:49.639
(Costello) Why don't you
make up your mind?

25:54.680 --> 25:56.511
(Abbott) Present arms!

25:56.640 --> 25:58.392
(gunfire)

26:00.160 --> 26:02.913
(Costello makes noises
over end theme tune)

26:12.800 --> 26:15.394
(cheering, whistling)

26:19.720 --> 26:22.553
It will be tough sledding again
for these Yanks.

26:22.680 --> 26:25.752
But the men who smashed
into Salerno from the sea...

26:25.880 --> 26:29.793
.. will take their next objective, too,
whatever it may be,...

26:29.920 --> 26:32.115
- ..from Naples to Berlin.
- (cheering)

26:36.160 --> 26:38.116
(# newsreel theme tune ends)

26:41.720 --> 26:45.998
Anzio, Bataan, St-Lô, lwo Jima.:

26:46.120 --> 26:49.874
places they had never heard of,
known, nor cared about.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.309
They went there and they died there.

26:52.440 --> 26:56.035
And now they are home,
wrapped in their country's flag...

26:56.160 --> 26:58.958
..and cloaked in their eternal greatness.

27:14.760 --> 27:20.232
Names. Yes, Polish and lrish andJewish
and English names hallow this ground.

27:20.360 --> 27:23.830
Names that make up
the great America they died for.

27:23.960 --> 27:30.308
A terrible cost, but less, tragically less,
than what we must pay for final victory.

27:44.440 --> 27:49.833
Time magazine estimates casualty rates

27:53.200 --> 27:56.875
No shit! So outta the group sitting here,
how much is that?

27:57.000 --> 28:00.754
Of the six of us here
about 4.3 of us would get it.

28:00.880 --> 28:04.350
Oh, wow. Only 2.7 of us would live.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.436
1.7, jerko.

28:07.720 --> 28:12.475
Listen, if you knew that you were
one of the guys who wasn't coming back,...

28:12.600 --> 28:16.878
..if you knew that right now, what would
you do with the last few days of your life?

28:17.000 --> 28:21.551
It could be anything, any fantasy. I give
everybody five seconds to think about it.

28:21.680 --> 28:24.638
I've thought of it.
I'd be one of the 1.7 comin' back!

28:24.760 --> 28:27.479
- This is morbid.
- I like it. Let's play for money.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.556
- For money?
- Five bucks a man.

28:29.680 --> 28:32.638
- The guy with the best fantasy wins.
- That's nuts.

28:32.760 --> 28:34.716
OK. All right. I'm in.

28:36.520 --> 28:39.353
- OK. We need a judge.
- I'll be the judge.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.675
- Why you?
- Because I thought of the game.

28:41.800 --> 28:45.634
When it's my turn somebody else
judges me. Ante up, everybody.

28:46.400 --> 28:49.437
- Come on, Arnold. Five bucks.
- I don't sell my fantasies.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.118
(all groan)

28:51.240 --> 28:53.196
Don't be like that, Arnold.

28:55.840 --> 28:57.796
OK. Carney.

28:58.680 --> 29:02.559
You're first.
You're gonna be dead. Killed in action.

29:02.680 --> 29:05.035
What do you wanna do with
the last few days of your life?

29:06.040 --> 29:07.871
- How much time do I have to do it in?
- A week.

29:08.000 --> 29:11.197
- I need ten days.
- It's my game. You only get a week.

29:11.320 --> 29:13.880
What are you gonna do with it, Danny?

29:15.080 --> 29:16.718
OK.

29:16.840 --> 29:19.434
- I'd sing at Radio City Music Hall.
- (laughter)

29:19.560 --> 29:21.755
Five shows a day, my own spot.

29:21.880 --> 29:24.792
In the audience are
5,000 screamin', gorgeous girls...

29:24.920 --> 29:26.797
..and every one of 'em wants me.

29:26.920 --> 29:30.117
And there's one man,
the president of Decca Records,...

29:30.240 --> 29:33.915
..and he wants to give me a big contract.
I have to make a choice.

29:34.040 --> 29:38.795
- Take the record contract. I would.
- Yeah, right, I take the record contract.

29:38.920 --> 29:40.831
Hah! Moron!

29:40.960 --> 29:45.431
He could've humped 5,000 girls and now
he's got a contract that ain't worth shit!

29:45.560 --> 29:50.429
Wrong, because now I'm a big star
and everyone knows stars get all the girls.

29:50.560 --> 29:52.630
Oh, yeah? How? You're dead!

29:52.760 --> 29:55.228
Girls don't go out with dead record stars!

29:55.360 --> 29:58.670
Bullshit, it's my fantasy!
I can do whatever I want with it.

29:58.800 --> 30:02.395
- What's my score, Gene?
- You started off with an A minus,...

30:02.520 --> 30:06.911
- ..but you ended up with a B.
- B! Better than I ever did in school.

30:07.040 --> 30:09.793
- Selridge is next.
- OK, OK, here we go.

30:11.480 --> 30:14.313
I make it with seven
of the richest women in the world,...

30:14.440 --> 30:18.194
..and I'm so hot, each one of 'em
gives me a million bucks.

30:18.320 --> 30:22.438
So at the end of the week I got
seven million bucks. Pretty good, huh?

30:23.000 --> 30:27.312
- If you're dead, what d'you do with $ 7m?
- I told you. That's why I need ten days.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.396
I need a weekend to spend the money.

30:29.520 --> 30:32.478
Give up, suckers. I got you all beat!

30:32.600 --> 30:36.195
Moronic. It's beyond moronic.
It's sub-moronic.

30:36.320 --> 30:39.392
Yeah. Jerome, break their hearts
and tell 'em my score.

30:39.520 --> 30:42.751
It lacks poetry. I give Selridge a B minus.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.713
- (laughter)
- B minus! You give me a B minus?

30:45.840 --> 30:49.469
This creep becomes a dead record star
and he gets a B. I want my money back!

30:49.600 --> 30:51.670
Touch that money and you're dead!

30:51.800 --> 30:55.475
I was kiddin'. You think I was serious?
I was kiddin'. Who's next?

30:56.240 --> 30:58.117
- Hennesey.
- Me?

30:58.240 --> 31:00.800
- No, I'm not ready yet.
- It's your turn.

31:01.560 --> 31:04.711
- I'm not very good at things like this.
- Come on. Just say it.

31:06.440 --> 31:09.716
- I can't think of anything.
- He can't think, so he's out, tough shit.

31:09.840 --> 31:12.400
- Give him an F. Who's next?
- No, no, OK, OK.

31:13.920 --> 31:17.833
- I'd spend it with my family.
- Oh! ls this guy serious?

31:17.960 --> 31:19.757
- Asshole.
- Spend it with my family!

31:19.880 --> 31:23.031
Come on. It's my last week.
I can do whatever I want, and I'd...

31:23.160 --> 31:27.312
- Yeah, I'd like it to be with my family.
- OK, what're you givin' for that crap?

31:27.440 --> 31:30.796
Well, it's not that interesting,
but at least it's honest.

31:30.920 --> 31:33.753
- B+.
- OK! That's it!

31:33.880 --> 31:36.394
This game is fixed.
I'm callin' the military police.

31:36.520 --> 31:39.080
I get a B minus for screwin'
seven millionairesses?

31:39.200 --> 31:41.919
And he gets a B+
for goin' home to his mother?!

31:42.040 --> 31:44.474
I wanna change my answer.
I wanna visit the sick.

31:44.600 --> 31:48.070
Will you knock it off, Selridge?
You had your turn.

31:48.200 --> 31:51.795
- (man) See you in the morning.
- (bugle sounds the retreat)

31:53.320 --> 31:57.313
As you were.
Lights out in five minutes, boys.

31:57.440 --> 31:59.396
Better get your rest.

31:59.520 --> 32:02.796
You never know what surprise
is comin' up tomorrow.

32:04.880 --> 32:07.030
- OK. Wykowski, you're next.
- OK.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.838
(laughter)

32:10.960 --> 32:14.316
I always wanted to make it
with a world-famous woman.

32:14.440 --> 32:18.513
Somebody that nobody could have in this
country but me, and be the only American.

32:18.640 --> 32:20.551
Have you someone in mind?

32:20.680 --> 32:22.875
Yeah, I got someone in mind.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.037
- I think we're headin' for an A+.
- Who's the woman, Wykowski?

32:26.160 --> 32:28.469
The Queen of England. Boom!

32:28.600 --> 32:33.116
- The Queen of England! Ugh!
- Like makin' it with your grandmother!

32:33.240 --> 32:37.233
- For a whole week?
- Maybe we'd stop for tea and crumpets.

32:37.360 --> 32:40.318
Apes and gorillas.
I'm living with apes and gorillas.

32:40.440 --> 32:44.638
- What's his score? Give him his score.
- Give the Earl of Meatloaf his score.

32:44.760 --> 32:49.595
This is a tough one. I find it
completely unredeeming in every way,...

32:49.720 --> 32:52.678
..morally, ethically and sexually.

32:52.800 --> 32:54.836
But it's got style.

32:54.960 --> 32:57.599
- A minus.
- A minus? You're sick, Jerome.

32:57.720 --> 33:00.712
To the guy who humps
the mother of the British Empire?

33:00.840 --> 33:03.638
- So I'm winning, right?
- Not yet. Two more to go.

33:03.760 --> 33:07.150
Epstein's next. I wanna hear what
his last week on earth would be like.

33:07.280 --> 33:10.078
Probably wants to take
an English exam at City College.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.953
- (bugle)
- Hurry up. They're blowin' retreat.

33:13.080 --> 33:17.631
Come on, Arnold. It's your last week
on earth. What's your secret desire?

33:17.760 --> 33:20.991
I don't want to say it.
If I say it, it might not come true.

33:21.120 --> 33:25.989
I know, he wants to pass gas. He wants
to bend over and blow up the whole world.

33:26.120 --> 33:28.998
Will you give him a chance, please?
He has one.

33:29.120 --> 33:33.272
What is it, Arnold? What's the last thing
you wanna do on this earth?

33:35.840 --> 33:39.879
I would like to make
Sergeant Merwin J Toomey...

33:40.000 --> 33:42.753
..do 200 push-ups
in front of this platoon.

33:44.560 --> 33:46.630
That's good.

33:46.760 --> 33:51.515
- I hate to admit it, but it's good.
- It's all right. 500 would've been better.

33:51.640 --> 33:53.790
- I think it's terrific. A+.
- Oooh!

33:53.920 --> 33:57.276
- A+! You're crazy. Now you can't win.
- I can still tie him.

33:57.400 --> 34:00.358
All right, but if it's a tie,
all bets are off. Nobody wins.

34:00.480 --> 34:04.632
Fair enough. Somebody else has
to judge me. Wykowski, pick a judge.

34:05.560 --> 34:08.233
- OK, sure. I pick Selridge.
- I love it.

34:08.360 --> 34:11.909
No matter what crap he says, he gets
an A+. You money is safe, boys.

34:12.040 --> 34:14.793
Retreat means lights out, goddammit!

34:16.040 --> 34:19.077
I've never had men
do push-ups in bed before.

34:19.199 --> 34:21.156
I could start tonight!

34:27.040 --> 34:30.918
- (Wykowski) Jerome, let's hear yours.
- All right.

34:34.480 --> 34:36.232
OK.

34:36.360 --> 34:41.797
I always wanted to get mine wiping out
an entire battalion of Japanese marines.

34:41.920 --> 34:45.674
Forget the medals. What do you do
on your last week on earth?

34:46.320 --> 34:48.708
I would lose my virginity,...

34:48.840 --> 34:51.592
..win the Pulitzer prize for literature...

34:52.880 --> 34:55.440
..and fall in love with the perfect girl.

34:55.560 --> 34:58.233
Why not score a winning
touchdown for Notre Dame, too?

34:58.360 --> 35:00.954
Give him his score
so's we can take our money back.

35:01.080 --> 35:04.390
- I give him a C minus.
- What?!

35:04.520 --> 35:08.354
Hey, I'm not gonna let him beat me
with that pissy story. I had somethin' hot.

35:08.480 --> 35:12.268
I'm not giving A+ for falling in love.
Why doesn't he visit Hennesey's family?

35:12.400 --> 35:14.630
Jesus, you're a moron!

35:15.400 --> 35:18.153
Go look in the latrine
and see if you dropped your brain.

35:18.280 --> 35:22.034
(Jerome whispers) Come on,
Arnold, you win. It's your money.

35:23.720 --> 35:27.190
(Wykowski) It's always the Jews
who end up with the money. Right, Roy?

35:27.320 --> 35:31.916
- Don't know. Never met one before now.
- They're easy to spot. There's one.

35:33.480 --> 35:35.277
- There's another one.
- (laughing)

35:35.400 --> 35:39.359
They slide the bacon under their toast,
so no one sees 'em eat it. Right, Jerome?

35:39.480 --> 35:42.631
I'm not going to take that Jew crap
from you any more, Wykowski.

35:42.760 --> 35:45.718
I know you can probably beat
the hell out of me, but I'm not...

35:45.840 --> 35:50.197
- Sure. You'll take any shit from me.
- Hey, hey, sh.

35:50.320 --> 35:53.676
- Come on, let's see how tough you are.
- Sh! Sh!

35:53.800 --> 35:57.031
Wykowski, what difference
does it make what religion he is?

35:57.160 --> 35:59.799
Epstein's the one
who's too good to take orders.

35:59.920 --> 36:03.629
If he doesn't shape up, I'll bust his face
whether he's got a Jew nose or not!

36:03.760 --> 36:05.751
(Toomey) Ten hut!

36:18.040 --> 36:20.793
- What the hell's goin' on here?
- Nothing, Sergeant.

36:20.920 --> 36:22.911
What do you mean "nothing", Hennesey?

36:23.040 --> 36:28.831
I heard threats, challenges, invitation
of bustin' noses of minority races.

36:29.440 --> 36:30.998
Hm.

36:35.480 --> 36:38.631
- You still tellin' me nothing's goin' on?
- Yes, sir.

36:39.760 --> 36:41.716
I see.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.073
Pinelli,...

36:50.200 --> 36:51.872
..Sweeney,...

36:52.000 --> 36:53.956
..Davis, Polaski,...

36:55.640 --> 36:57.596
..Woolridge, hit the floor.

37:01.360 --> 37:06.832
Give me 100 push-ups. If I can't discipline
these boys, maybe the rest of you can!

37:06.960 --> 37:12.159
- Count off!
- One, two, three, four,...

37:12.280 --> 37:16.512
..five, six, seven, eight,...

37:16.640 --> 37:18.232
..nine, ten...

37:18.360 --> 37:20.032
Piece of shit!

37:20.160 --> 37:21.513
Wykowski!

37:21.640 --> 37:23.596
(men carry on counting)

37:27.040 --> 37:28.996
Goddammit!

37:32.080 --> 37:36.517
I really hated myself because I didn"t
stand up for Epstein, a fellowJew.

37:36.640 --> 37:38.995
Maybe it was because
I was afraid of Wykowski,...

37:39.120 --> 37:42.351
..or maybe it was because
Arnold sometimes sort of asked for it.

37:42.480 --> 37:44.596
But since the guys
didn"t pick on me much,...

37:44.720 --> 37:48.156
..l figured l'd stay neutral like Switzerland.

37:49.960 --> 37:52.474
(man) Ready. Aim.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.352
Fire!

38:11.120 --> 38:13.475
(man) Cease fire! Cease fire!

38:18.520 --> 38:21.671
- How'd I do, Sergeant?
- I can't tell. Your bullets aren't down.

38:21.800 --> 38:26.112
This is pointless. I'll take prisoners,
but I won't shoot human beings.

38:26.240 --> 38:29.073
Shut up, Arnold.
They'll paste the targets on our faces.

38:29.200 --> 38:31.839
Helluva score, Wykowski.
Where'd you learn to shoot?

38:31.960 --> 38:35.396
- Back home.
- Probably killed his whole family.

38:35.520 --> 38:39.274
- What was that, Jerome?
- I was just admiring his skill.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.558
Jesus.

38:48.320 --> 38:53.075
- In some kind of trouble there, Jerome?
- It's not me, Sergeant. It's the gun.

38:54.560 --> 38:57.393
Epstein, reassemble Jerome's weapon.

38:58.440 --> 39:00.237
Jesus Christ!

39:02.080 --> 39:04.196
Deep shit, Epstein.

39:04.320 --> 39:07.995
How deep in the shit
would you say he was in, Jerome?

39:08.120 --> 39:09.872
About up to here.

39:11.680 --> 39:13.636
(bugle)

39:14.360 --> 39:16.316
(men groaning)

39:18.640 --> 39:21.712
Arnold Epstein always took
his punishment without complaint.

39:21.840 --> 39:26.391
More and more I wanted to be his friend
because he never seemed to need one.

39:27.160 --> 39:29.913
Could I have less shells
in my eggs this morning?

39:33.720 --> 39:35.676
Thank you.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.511
Whoo-hoo!

39:38.640 --> 39:43.395
48-hour pass. I'm gonna eat spaghetti
with clam sauce for two days.

39:43.520 --> 39:45.988
In Mississippi
they make spaghetti with cotton.

39:46.120 --> 39:49.635
We are set, guys.
I got the address of a place.

39:49.760 --> 39:51.910
Yeah, what kind of place?

39:52.040 --> 39:55.350
You wouldn't like it, Hennesey.
They don't have families there.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.232
- Son of a bitch!
- What's wrong?

39:57.360 --> 40:02.639
Hey! Somebody broke into my footlocker
last night. They emptied my wallet.

40:02.760 --> 40:05.593
They took my pay and every cent
I had in the world - 62 bucks.

40:05.720 --> 40:07.073
Dirty bastard!

40:07.200 --> 40:10.351
Well, how do know someone stole it?
Maybe you just lost it.

40:10.480 --> 40:14.234
Cos I counted it before I hit the sack.
I was saving it for the big weekend.

40:14.360 --> 40:18.876
Don't think I'm not wise to who did it. It
was Epstein. He wants to get back at me.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.834
Maybe he's sore at you,
but he's not the kind that steals money.

40:24.920 --> 40:26.751
Hey.

40:26.880 --> 40:30.077
Who asked you, Hennesey, huh?
What are you?

40:30.200 --> 40:32.760
What are you? One of those lrish Jews?

40:33.560 --> 40:37.314
Huh? All I did was call him a couple of
names. Where I'm from we're all Polacks.

40:37.440 --> 40:40.830
Dagos, niggers, sheenies -
that stuff doesn't mean crap to me.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.110
You're a Mick. What do I care?

40:44.120 --> 40:46.156
Yeah, half-Mick,...

40:46.280 --> 40:48.236
..half-nigger.

40:50.600 --> 40:53.956
- Whoa. You serious?
- Yeah.

40:54.080 --> 40:56.036
My father's lrish.

40:57.200 --> 40:59.156
My mother's Coloured.

40:59.280 --> 41:02.590
- You can't be. They wouldn't let you in.
- I never told anybody.

41:02.720 --> 41:06.838
Yeah, but I guessed it. See, it was
something I couldn't put my finger on,...

41:06.960 --> 41:11.670
- ..but I knew something was wrong.
- Yeah. I'm Black-lrish.

41:11.800 --> 41:16.396
That's as Coloured as I am, but now we
know how you think, don't we, 'Kowski?

41:17.000 --> 41:17.955
Come here.

41:18.080 --> 41:20.958
Hey! I'm layin' for you, Hennesey, OK?

41:21.080 --> 41:24.231
After I get the bastard who
stole my money, I'll settle with you!

41:24.360 --> 41:26.430
(man) Ten hut!

41:26.560 --> 41:28.516
On the double! Toomey's here.

41:33.080 --> 41:36.629
In the past 21 days you boys
have made some fine progress.

41:38.000 --> 41:39.956
You're not fighting soldiers yet,...

41:40.080 --> 41:44.471
..but I'd match you up against
some Nazi cocktail waitress any time.

41:44.600 --> 41:48.878
That's why I recommended
this platoon receive a 48-hour pass.

41:49.000 --> 41:53.596
But first we have
to clear up the mystery...

41:53.720 --> 41:56.359
..of Wykowski's missing $ 62.

41:56.480 --> 42:01.634
As I said - I hear, smell and know
everything that goes on in my barracks.

42:01.760 --> 42:06.436
I am askin' the guilty party
to place $ 62 on this here footlocker...

42:06.560 --> 42:10.633
..within the next 30 seconds.
I offer no lenience, no forgiveness,...

42:10.760 --> 42:14.639
..no abstention from punishment.
What I do offer is honour.

42:14.760 --> 42:17.718
I'm countin' down to 30.

42:17.840 --> 42:20.638
It is at this time that heroes are made.

42:21.240 --> 42:22.798
One,...

42:24.040 --> 42:25.951
..two,...

42:26.080 --> 42:28.150
..three,...

42:28.280 --> 42:29.838
..four,...

42:30.720 --> 42:32.278
..five,...

42:33.080 --> 42:34.638
..six...

42:41.040 --> 42:43.474
There's $ 62, if anyone cares to count it.

42:43.600 --> 42:46.956
I don't think that'll be necessary,
Private Epstein.

42:58.360 --> 43:00.316
Wykowski, pick up your money.

43:01.640 --> 43:03.596
Listen, don't count it, boy.

43:04.840 --> 43:06.592
Epstein.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.876
Do you have anything to say?

43:12.640 --> 43:14.392
No, Sergeant.

43:14.520 --> 43:17.671
May I ask why
you decided to return the money?

43:17.800 --> 43:19.472
I chose to.

43:19.600 --> 43:21.556
You chose to?

43:22.400 --> 43:26.279
Knowing full well that swift and just
punishment may be inflicted upon you...

43:26.400 --> 43:29.312
..when and if this is reported
to the commanding officer.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.396
I know it only too well.

43:32.280 --> 43:35.477
Last night at 0100 hours
I wandered through this barracks.

43:35.600 --> 43:40.071
I saw carelessness, complacency.

43:40.200 --> 43:44.432
Wykowski's wallet lying
in an open footlocker, inviting...

43:44.560 --> 43:46.516
..temptation and weakness.

43:47.360 --> 43:51.148
I took your $ 62, Wykowski,
returned the empty wallet to its place.

43:51.280 --> 43:54.113
I did it to teach you a lesson, instead...

43:54.240 --> 43:56.435
..l got submarined.

43:56.560 --> 43:59.597
Epstein, are you such
a goddamn ignorant fool...

43:59.720 --> 44:02.792
..to take the blame for something
you were innocent of?

44:02.920 --> 44:05.150
The army has its logic. I have my own.

44:06.520 --> 44:10.274
Epstein, I'd like a word
with you in private.

44:10.400 --> 44:13.358
The rest of you are on
48-hours' leave. Fall out!

44:25.600 --> 44:27.511
Why? Just tell me why.

44:28.880 --> 44:30.836
It's my job.

44:35.880 --> 44:40.032
You listen to me,
you flyspeck on a mound of horseshit.

44:40.960 --> 44:43.428
You're takin' me on, aren't ya?

44:43.560 --> 44:47.553
I have a nutcracker that crunches
the testicles of men that take me on.

44:47.680 --> 44:49.716
How do you think you can beat me?

44:49.840 --> 44:53.435
I'm not trying to. I just don't think
it's necessary to dehumanise a man...

44:53.560 --> 44:55.437
..in order to get him to perform.

44:55.560 --> 44:59.792
You can get better results raising
our spirits than lowering our dignity.

44:59.920 --> 45:02.832
This isn't Sunday school.
This isn't pass or fail.

45:02.960 --> 45:05.520
This is death shit we're talkin' about.

45:06.680 --> 45:10.434
Why in hell did you put back money
you knew you didn't take?

45:10.560 --> 45:13.836
Because I knew you did. I saw you take it.

45:13.960 --> 45:17.839
Inventing a crime that didn't exist
to enforce your theories of discipline...

45:17.960 --> 45:20.918
..is Neanderthal in its conception.

45:21.040 --> 45:26.114
You may be the first man to reach Berlin
cos I'm sending you in before everyone.

45:26.240 --> 45:30.358
Men do not face enemy guns because
they've been treated with kindness.

45:30.480 --> 45:33.836
I don't want them human.
I want them obedient!

45:33.960 --> 45:37.999
I'm tryin' to save those boys' lives,
you crawlin' bookworm.

45:38.120 --> 45:40.395
Stand in my way,...

45:40.520 --> 45:43.671
..l'll pulverise ya into chicken droppings!

46:01.160 --> 46:03.515
You know, I don't get you, Epstein.

46:04.680 --> 46:08.878
- Why do a dumb-ass thing like that?
- What's the difference?

46:09.000 --> 46:12.629
I knew he took the money
and I knew I'd end up cleaning latrines.

46:12.760 --> 46:15.069
Thought I'd save everybody some time.

46:15.200 --> 46:17.156
Yeah, well, uh,...

46:18.640 --> 46:20.995
..anyway, I owe you one.

46:22.960 --> 46:26.635
You stuck your neck out for us,
and I like to pay back my debts.

46:32.520 --> 46:37.514
Hey, listen, it's not gonna come out again,
so take your chance while you got it.

46:37.640 --> 46:39.756
Let's not be hypocritical.

46:39.880 --> 46:41.996
I did what I did for me, not for you.

46:44.080 --> 46:47.789
You know what? I'm not gonna make
any more Jew cracks at you, Epstein,...

46:47.920 --> 46:50.878
..cos you are a shit-heel
no matter what you are!

46:51.680 --> 46:53.636
Let's go, Roy.

46:59.920 --> 47:04.835
Why is it that we come from the same
background but I can't understand you?

47:04.960 --> 47:06.871
You're a witness.

47:07.000 --> 47:09.912
You're always standing around
watching what's happening.

47:10.040 --> 47:13.271
You're scribbling in your book
what other people do.

47:14.440 --> 47:17.159
You have to get in the middle of it.

47:17.280 --> 47:20.352
You have to take sides.

47:20.480 --> 47:22.835
Make a contribution to the fight.

47:23.440 --> 47:26.512
- What fight?
- Any fight.

47:26.640 --> 47:28.596
The one you believe in.

47:30.240 --> 47:32.993
Until you do,
you'll never be a writer, Eugene.

47:42.920 --> 47:48.631
# No, no, no! Don't go walkin' down
Lovers' Lane with anyone else but me

47:48.760 --> 47:51.115
# Till I come marchin'...

47:51.240 --> 47:53.834
Hey, hubba, hubba. Look at that! Women!

47:53.960 --> 47:56.633
Hey, honey, you got 34 friends?

47:57.840 --> 48:00.991
Hey, 'Kowski, maybe
the Queen of England's in town!

48:01.760 --> 48:04.399
Hey, don't blow smoke on me.
I'll stink from tobacco.

48:04.520 --> 48:07.910
Stop worryin'.
Nothin' can penetrate that Aqua velva.

48:09.720 --> 48:12.678
Hey, Carney, are you goin'...
to Selridge's place?

48:12.800 --> 48:15.314
Yeah, sure, why not? What about you?

48:15.440 --> 48:18.989
Maybe. Thought I'd look around first,
see if I can meet a nice girl.

48:19.120 --> 48:21.759
No chance. There's 14,000 Gls
on leave in Biloxi...

48:21.880 --> 48:24.872
..and only 12 Catholic girls,
all handcuffed to nuns.

48:25.000 --> 48:26.956
Why don't you come with us?

48:28.440 --> 48:30.874
This isn't your first time, is it?

48:31.000 --> 48:33.798
I mean, you've done it before, right?

48:33.920 --> 48:37.071
Yeah, sure. Are you kidding?
Five or six times.

48:38.560 --> 48:40.869
Well, if you did it before,...

48:41.000 --> 48:43.355
..why are you doing it again?

48:43.480 --> 48:46.950
What do you mean?
You're kidding me, right?

48:47.080 --> 48:50.231
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm kiddin'. I'm kiddin'.

48:50.360 --> 48:52.351
Couldn't you tell?

49:29.000 --> 49:31.560
Looks like a bad day to fall in love.

49:43.280 --> 49:45.840
Let's get some ice cream
before we go to the place.

49:45.960 --> 49:47.916
All right.

49:48.680 --> 49:50.636
(wolf-whistling)

49:56.760 --> 50:00.196
- They're not bad.
- If you wait your turn, you'll be too old.

50:00.320 --> 50:02.436
- You comin'?
- Yeah, we're comin'. Right?

50:02.560 --> 50:04.630
Hey, you bet. Let me at 'em!

50:04.760 --> 50:06.512
(laughing)

50:08.920 --> 50:12.993
- This is it. Peachtree Street.
- Kind of a crummy neighbourhood.

50:13.120 --> 50:16.112
She ain't sellin' stocks and bonds.
I don't believe this guy.

50:16.240 --> 50:19.038
Gene, can you lend me ten bucks
in case I wanna go twice?

50:19.160 --> 50:21.355
Twi... You mean she charges every time...

50:21.480 --> 50:23.596
Yeah, she has a cash register
on her bed.

50:23.720 --> 50:27.269
- Will you come on?
- How does she know you had one?

50:27.400 --> 50:32.520
Your eyes spin around and when they stop
on two pineapples, you had one!

50:36.760 --> 50:38.591
21. This is it.

50:49.920 --> 50:53.913
- Looks like a place that sells radio parts.
- What did we bring this guy for?

50:54.040 --> 50:56.429
- Let's toss for who goes first.
- I go first.

50:56.560 --> 51:00.838
Yeah, I meant the rest of us
will toss. Naturally you go first.

51:04.120 --> 51:06.156
A half an hour he's been in there!

51:06.280 --> 51:09.158
If he doesn't hurry up,
I'm gonna pass my peak.

51:09.280 --> 51:12.113
Hey, what if she's ugly?
I mean, really ugly?

51:12.240 --> 51:14.390
Close your eyes
and think of a cheerleader.

51:14.520 --> 51:18.069
I don't wanna close my eyes.
That's the same as doing it to yourself.

51:18.200 --> 51:21.988
Not if you're feelin' someone
underneath you, or on top of you.

51:22.120 --> 51:25.669
On top of me?
Who would be on top of me?

51:25.800 --> 51:27.995
She would. She could be anywhere.

51:28.120 --> 51:31.271
Under a table, on a chair
or an ironing board.

51:31.400 --> 51:33.118
On an ironing board?

51:33.240 --> 51:36.471
What kind of a girl is this? I thought
we were going to a regular place.

51:36.600 --> 51:38.556
Don't you know anything?

51:39.480 --> 51:43.553
Maybe not in actual experience,
but I have all the information I need.

51:43.680 --> 51:47.912
You don't know shit, Jerome. Do you
know how many positions there are?

51:48.040 --> 51:52.955
- American or worldwide?
- (laughs) This guy is a riot!

51:53.080 --> 51:56.356
For five bucks,
how many positions are there?

51:56.480 --> 51:58.755
- Lemme think.
- You want me to tell you?

51:58.880 --> 52:02.190
- No.
- There are 17 acceptable positions.

52:02.320 --> 52:05.835
Acceptable? What is there, an Olympic
committee that votes on positions?

52:05.960 --> 52:08.155
I can't believe this guy is from New York.

52:08.280 --> 52:11.317
Besides, you're wrong.
There's 52 positions.

52:11.440 --> 52:14.910
52?! You're crazy!
Where did you ever get that from?

52:15.040 --> 52:17.600
I saw a dirty deck of cards once.

52:18.400 --> 52:20.755
This jerk is worse than Epstein.

52:20.880 --> 52:24.236
- You owe me five bucks.
- Hey, listen, twerp,...

52:24.360 --> 52:26.669
..you're lucky if you do one position.

52:26.800 --> 52:28.995
I'm not doing anything
on an ironing board.

52:29.120 --> 52:32.078
Why not?
You'll get your shirt pressed for free.

52:32.800 --> 52:34.995
Well? Tell us. Tell us!

52:35.120 --> 52:37.475
She wants to see me again after the war.

52:39.680 --> 52:41.238
(Selridge laughs)

52:41.360 --> 52:43.954
See you fellas at the USO.

52:46.080 --> 52:47.672
OK, whose turn is it?

52:47.800 --> 52:51.236
You go ahead. I just had lunch.
I don't wanna get cramps.

52:51.360 --> 52:53.032
Yeah.

52:53.160 --> 52:56.311
I'll try and leave
a little somethin' for you guys.

52:57.640 --> 52:59.596
Hey, how you doin'?

53:11.000 --> 53:15.596
If you're nervous about this, we don't have
to do this. There's that dance at the USO.

53:15.720 --> 53:20.077
Oh, no, I wanna do it. I don't mean
I wanna do it. I think I should do it.

53:20.200 --> 53:22.236
I mean, eventually I have to do it, right?

53:22.360 --> 53:24.316
Well, yeah, eventually.

53:25.880 --> 53:29.190
Look, why don't we go to the dance?
We can always come back later.

53:29.320 --> 53:32.073
Yeah. We could always come back later.

53:40.520 --> 53:44.399
- Don't tell the guys I didn't do it.
- They'll know. They'll see it on your face.

53:44.520 --> 53:47.239
No, they won't. I'm a good actor.
I can act like I did it.

53:47.360 --> 53:49.316
Come on, let's just go.

53:50.440 --> 53:53.352
My cap. Shit! I left my cap upstairs.

53:53.480 --> 53:55.436
Well, go get it.

53:58.480 --> 54:01.153
- You're through already? That was fast.
- (chuckles)

54:01.280 --> 54:04.829
I never even made it to the bed.
I knew I hit my peak too soon.

54:14.800 --> 54:17.189
You the only one left, honey?

54:17.320 --> 54:19.993
What? Oh, yeah, I guess I am.

54:20.680 --> 54:24.832
Well, let's get goin', sugar.
I got some navy boys comin' at two.

54:31.400 --> 54:33.356
very pleased to meet you.

54:48.320 --> 54:51.676
Hey, come on, kid. I ain't got all day.

54:59.720 --> 55:02.393
- It's chilly in here, isn't it?
- Yeah(!)

55:02.520 --> 55:04.670
About 96 degrees!

55:05.760 --> 55:10.709
Keep your shorts on if you want, but I've
a rule against wearin' army shoes to bed.

55:10.840 --> 55:12.273
Oh.

55:12.400 --> 55:14.709
I was just about to take them off.

55:14.840 --> 55:17.195
I always take them off.

55:17.320 --> 55:19.880
You don't mind
a little perfume, do ya, honey?

55:20.000 --> 55:25.313
There was a boy this mornin' with a gallon
of Aqua velva. Nearly drove me crazy.

55:25.440 --> 55:28.238
Oh, that's OK.
You could even spray some on me.

55:34.880 --> 55:36.950
Gee, that smells good.

55:37.080 --> 55:41.756
If you'd like a bottle for your girlfriend,
I sell 'em $ 5 apiece.

55:41.880 --> 55:45.156
- You sell perfume, too?
- I sell hard-to-get items.

55:45.280 --> 55:47.748
Silk stockings, black panties.

55:47.880 --> 55:51.031
- You interested?
- Do you carry men's clothing?

55:52.720 --> 55:55.473
Oh, that's cute. You're cute, honey.

55:56.800 --> 55:59.712
Is this your first time?

55:59.840 --> 56:01.831
My first time?

56:01.960 --> 56:04.235
Are you kidding? That's funny.

56:04.360 --> 56:06.157
No.

56:06.280 --> 56:08.794
It's my second time.

56:08.920 --> 56:11.150
First time they were closed.

56:11.280 --> 56:14.272
You don't smoke cigarettes either, do ya?

56:14.400 --> 56:18.359
- How d'you know that?
- Looked like your face was on fire.

56:18.480 --> 56:22.029
You wanna look older,
why don't you try a moustache?

56:23.400 --> 56:26.233
- What's your name?
- Rowena. What's yours?

56:26.360 --> 56:28.316
- It's Eug...
- Eug?

56:28.440 --> 56:30.271
It's a huge name.

56:30.400 --> 56:32.994
It's Jack Bobby Lou Mulgreevy.

56:33.120 --> 56:36.032
- Where you from, Bobby Lou?
- Texarkana.

56:36.160 --> 56:38.913
- Is that right?
- (drawls) Yes, ma'am.

56:39.040 --> 56:41.634
Is that Texas or Arkansas?

56:41.760 --> 56:44.672
- Arkansas, I think.
- You think?

56:44.800 --> 56:48.349
Well, we left there when
I was two and moved to Georgia.

56:48.480 --> 56:50.835
Really? You a Cracker?

56:50.960 --> 56:54.191
- What's a Cracker?
- Someone from Georgia.

56:54.320 --> 56:56.595
Oh, yeah, I'm a Cracker.

56:56.720 --> 56:58.676
Whole family's crackers.

56:59.720 --> 57:02.280
- Were you born in Biloxi?
- No. Gulfport.

57:02.400 --> 57:04.675
I still live there with my husband.

57:05.480 --> 57:07.835
Your husband! You're married?

57:07.960 --> 57:11.589
- God, he'll kill me if he finds me here.
- No, he won't.

57:11.720 --> 57:15.474
- Does he know that you're a...
- Why, sure he does. That's how we met.

57:15.600 --> 57:17.352
He's in the Coast Guard.

57:17.480 --> 57:20.119
He was one of my best customers.
He still is.

57:21.280 --> 57:23.430
You mean you charge your own husband?

57:23.560 --> 57:26.120
I mean he's my best lover.

57:27.320 --> 57:32.440
You gonna do it from there, cowboy,
cos I'll have to make some adjustments.

57:32.560 --> 57:36.633
- I was just waiting for you to get ready.
- I'm always ready, sugar.

57:38.160 --> 57:40.754
You wanna pull down the window shade?

57:40.880 --> 57:42.632
Sure.

57:57.440 --> 58:00.113
You scared, honey, first time an' all?

58:00.240 --> 58:03.630
- A little, I guess.
- Don't fret about it.

58:03.760 --> 58:07.673
When it's a boy's first time
it makes it feel like it's my first time.

58:15.480 --> 58:17.755
D'you like the left side or the right?

58:17.880 --> 58:21.316
If we do it right, hon,
we're gonna use both sides.

58:21.440 --> 58:22.998
You come to Mama now.

58:25.360 --> 58:28.432
Would it be OK
if we didn't use the word "Mama"?

58:28.560 --> 58:31.950
It makes me think of my mother
and that sort of kills it, you know?

58:32.080 --> 58:33.832
Sure.

58:39.240 --> 58:41.151
That's a boy.

58:41.280 --> 58:43.236
There, now.

58:44.640 --> 58:46.596
Come on.

58:48.320 --> 58:52.154
OK, honey, do your stuff.

58:52.280 --> 58:54.157
What stuff is that?

58:54.280 --> 58:58.319
Whatever you like to do.
Didn't anyone ever teach you anything?

58:58.440 --> 59:03.150
Well, my brother showed me a few things.
You look a lot different from my brother.

59:03.280 --> 59:05.316
Oh, you're sweet.

59:05.440 --> 59:07.954
I went to high school with a boy like you.

59:08.080 --> 59:10.116
Had the biggest damn crush on him.

59:11.480 --> 59:14.040
Listen, don't be offended,...

59:14.160 --> 59:17.311
..but this doesn't have to be
the greatest experience of my life.

59:17.440 --> 59:19.908
I really just wanted to get it over with.

59:20.040 --> 59:23.555
Well, you just let Rowena
take care of everything, honey.

59:23.680 --> 59:27.639
All you gotta do is put
your arms around me. Come on.

59:29.320 --> 59:31.276
That's it.

59:36.200 --> 59:40.079
There, now, you're doin' fine.

59:40.200 --> 59:42.589
- You got your knee on my stomach.
- I'm sorry.

59:42.720 --> 59:44.915
Let's get those shorts off.

59:45.040 --> 59:48.237
That's better. Now, isn't that better?

59:48.360 --> 59:50.999
Oh. Oh, God!

59:51.120 --> 59:52.712
Oh!

59:52.840 --> 59:53.909
Oh, God!

59:54.040 --> 59:56.395
Relax, hon. Nothin' to it, sugar.

59:56.520 --> 59:59.273
You're not breathin'. Breathe!

59:59.400 --> 01:00:01.311
My nose is running.

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:03.271
No, I'm OK.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.834
Don't stop, baby, you're gettin' there.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.313

Oh. Oh...

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.875

- You girls always wear white gloves?
- It's proper attire for a lady at a dance.

01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:42.072
In the old days a man would
hold a handkerchief in his hand...

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:44.634
..so as not to touch
the bare back of his partner.

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:47.718
No kiddin'? Next time
I'll come here in a tank.

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:55.312

Aw, who wants to?

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.271
- Nothin' better than what we had. Right?
- Right, yeah.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:03.358

roller coaster, ain't she?

- Hey. Hi, guys, what's cookin'?
- How'd it go?

01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:16.357
How'd it go? It was fine as wine.
Sorta chatty, know what I mean?

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:19.040
Chatty? First time
in the sack with a pro was chatty?

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:21.879
Real smooth. Second time
was swing, swing, swing.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.959
- Second time? You paid twice?
- No, it was a freebie. On the house.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:30.915
- Why would she give you a free one?
- Maybe I was her one millionth customer.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.996
Think I'll look around.

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.992

- What?
- I said would you care to dance?

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.799
Oh. I don't dance very well.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:11.674

- No, I swear. I never dance.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.634
- Then why did you come to a dance?
- It's a good question.

01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.751
I like to listen to music...

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:22.158
..and I was hoping that I'd meet
somebody I could talk to. I like to talk.

01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:25.310
Well, we could talk while we dance.

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.550

- A little.

01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.836
I can see your lips movin'.

01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:50.713
My lips don't move, my feet don't move.

- Perfume?

01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.276
It's ladies' perfume.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:02.312
I smelt it before.
Two of the other soldiers had it on.

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:06.228
Oh, yeah. It's... it's for my mother.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:09.113
The lady on the counter sprayed it on me.

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.230
Do you think it's too strong?

01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:16.478
Well, yours is a little different.
Yours has a little Aqua velva in it.

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.160
Well, that's me underneath.

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:22.909
- What's your name?
- Eugene Morris Jerome.

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:26.032
If you want the short version, it's Eugene.

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:29.675
- What's your name?
- Daisy. Daisy Hannigan.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:33.554
Dai... No kiddin'? That's a beautiful name.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:37.073
Daisy is my favourite character
in literature.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.476
- Daisy Miller or Daisy Buchanan?
- Buchanan.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:44.229
The Great Gatsby is one of
my all-time favourite books.

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:48.512
- I've never read Daisy Miller. Is it good?
- Oh, it's wonderful.

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:52.633
You look surprised.
We do read in the South, you know.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.830
I know.

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:57.713

- I do?

01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.432
Uh-huh.

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.835
It's like a birthday look.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:04.520
- Today isn't your birthday, is it?
- No.

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.712
Something special
happened to you today, am I right?

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.398
Yeah.

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:13.876
- Can you tell me about it?
- I don't think so.

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:19.355
- I might put it in my memoirs, though.
- Oh.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:23.439
- Do you keep a journal every day?
- Yes. Since I was 14.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:26.233
I write down everything
that happens to me.

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.319
- Do you like writin'?
- Yeah. It's what I hope to be one day.

dancin' with me tonight?

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.348
Yeah, probably.

No, we only come in once a month.

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.480
Maybe I could come out to Gulfport.

01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:15.358
Well, we're really
not allowed to make dates.

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:19.598
Well, it wouldn't be a date
if I was just to bump into you, would it?

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:22.473
Well, it would be if I went to confession.

01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:28.476
Especially if I told you I went
to St Mary's on Piermont Street.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.955
- Goodbye, Eugene.
- Goodbye, Daisy.

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:37.309

in that whole conversation.

01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.877
No. We'll ask him if it's all right
when we get through.

When we get through!

You have no right.
It's like opening his mail.

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:10.439
Bullshit! It's private things about all of us.
It's public domain like in the newspapers.

Newspapers are published. Unpublished
memoirs are the writer's sole property.

I didn't know they were lawyers, too.

- What do you mean?

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:24.600

Father is to have you excommunicated,...

I thought you were
Eugene's friend, Epstein.

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:47.071
He left his locker open. Why'd he leave
something so private in an open locker?

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:50.715
It has no logic to it.
I have no interest in illogical things.

01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:54.310
Well, you tell Gene I had
nothin' to do with this, you hear?

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.396

- Yeah, well, who's Louise?

My mother. But he's full of it.
I never called my mother Louise.

- Two what?
- Two fantasies came true.

- I lost my virginity and I fell in love.
- With Rowena?

Not enough to kill ya. Just enough
to keep you from walking straight.

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.712
Hey.

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:51.069
- Anybody seen my notebook?
- What notebook is that?

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:55.715
The one I'm always writing in.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.076
Arnold, have you seen it?

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:02.880
Why did you leave your locker open?

01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:07.151
Because I lost the key
down the shower drain.

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.670
There was nothing valuable
in there except my notebook.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.916
I thought I could trust the guys here.

01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:16.476
Hey, that's funny, Jerome,
cos we thought we could trust you, too.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.556
What does that mean?

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:23.476
"One night a scream from Selridge...

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:25.670
- Hey! Gimme that!
- ..calling out Louise!"

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:28.837
- "Is Louise his girlfriend or mother?"
- You have no right!

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:32.316
Yeah? And you got no business
writing down my dreams.

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:36.194
- Give it back. Nobody is interested.
- Not even in what he thinks about you?

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:40.518
- Give it to me!
- You want an arm broken, it's up to you.

01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:44.394
- 'Kowski, please don't read that.
- If it gets boring, I'll stop.

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:48.593
"I can't make Don Carney out yet.
Basically he's OK and I like him."

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:53.513
"But there's something
about him you can't count on,...

01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:58.191
..and if I was ever in real trouble
Don Carney's the last one I'd turn to."

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:05.037
Well... Iet's just hope
you don't have to count on me.

01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.071
It doesn't mean anything.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:10.158
- I get a thought and I write it down.
- Let him go, Selridge.

01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:12.840
Wanna take his place?
I don't care whose arm I break.

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:16.396
OK, you ready for the best part?
Here's the best part.

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:18.476
"Wykowski is pure animal."

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:23.035
"He masturbates in bed
four or five times a night."

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:26.994
"He has no shame about it
and his capacities are enormous."

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:30.237
"sometimes when he has a discharge
he announces it to the room:

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.750
"Number five torpedo fired,
loading number six."'

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.838
Hey, Epstein,
can I sue him for defamation of...

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:38.998
- What is it?
- Character?

01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:43.193
Only if his intent is to prove malice,
and in your case it's not possible.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.276
- Read more.
- Where was l?

01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:48.153
You just fired number five.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:51.750
"Despite Wykowski's
lack of culture, sensitivity...

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:54.758
..or the pursuit of
anything minutely intellectual,...

01:12:54.880 --> 01:13:00.557
..his greatest strength is his earnest
belief that he belongs on the battlefield."

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:03.433
"He is clearly the best soldier in the pl...

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.434
..in the platoon,
dependable under pressure."

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:12.509
"It wouldn't surprise me if Wykowski came
out of the war with the Medal of Honor."

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.150
You really mean that, Jerome?

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:18.510
I told you, I don't mean any of it.

01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:21.837
Right now I would describe you
in three words: a yellow bastard!

01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:26.988
Yeah, well, they don't give the Medal of
Honor to yellow bastards. Let him go, Sel.

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:36.476
What do you write this down for?
You'll make a lotta guys unhappy.

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:39.433
What I write in my book
is my business. Give it to me.

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:42.358
Don't I get to hear my life story?

01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:44.948
Arnold, I beg you!

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.957
Don't read that!

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:49.514
They're my private thoughts!

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:53.189
- If you take them, you steal from me.
- I gather it's unflattering.

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:57.598
Don't you know me by now, Gene?
I can't be unflattered. I'm past it.

01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.712
However, if you don't want me
to read it, I won't read it.

01:14:00.840 --> 01:14:05.516
But I don't think we'll be able to be
truly honest with each other from now on.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.240
Put it back when you're through.

01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:16.676
(clears throat)

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.556
Well, don't we get to hear it?

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:34.318
"Arnold Epstein's constant pursuit of
truth, logic and reason fascinates me...

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.796
..in the same proportion as
his obstinacy and unnecessary heroics...

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.876
..drive me to distraction."

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:44.789
"But I love him for it, in the same
manner that I love Joe DiMaggio...

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:48.959
..for making the gesture
of catching a long fly ball to centre."

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:53.073
"seemed like the last miracle
performed by God in modern times."

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:57.636
"But often I hold back showing
my love and affection for Arnold...

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.672
..because I think he might misinterpret it."

01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.952
"It just happens to be
my instinctive feeling that Arnold...

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:09.076
..is...

01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.236
..homosexual,...

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:15.113
..and it bothers me that it bothers me."

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.036
(bugle sounds the retreat)

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:33.872
Do you see why I find life so interesting?

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.154
Because here is a man who in three weeks
has come to the brilliant conclusion...

01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:42.556
..that a cretin like Wykowski
is going to win the Medal of Honor...

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:46.434
..and that his most esteemed
and dearest friend is a fairy.

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.236
(Toomey) Lights out!

01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:18.749
It is my opinion that no one here gets
a wink of sleep tonight. Good night, fellas.

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:48.031
The weekends I spent with Daisy made the
weeks in the army even more unbearable.

01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:51.909
I knew this romance
wouldn"t survive the war...

01:16:52.040 --> 01:16:55.555
..or the differences
in our backgrounds or our futures,...

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:58.433
..but I didn"t let Daisy know
I felt that way.

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:06.711
I wanted every hour we spent together
to be perfect, and it was,...

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:09.400
..because I think she knew it, too.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:44.593
Who the hell turned this light out?

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:46.676
- Oh, Christ!
- Who's there?

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:54.074
Goddammit, Lindstrom!

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:59.479
Why didn't you tell the army what you
were, save the trouble of a court martial?

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:02.114
The other soldier with Lindstrom...

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:05.391
..flew out that window
with the dexterity of a paratrooper.

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:10.640
He was seen but not identified entering
our latrine window a few minutes later.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:15.515
Unlike the missing $ 62,
this time it wasn't me.

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:20.593
So... who the hell was it?

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:26.476
Private Lindstrom, a nervous young man,...

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:30.593
..will surely crack under
the strain of interrogation.

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:35.635
Therefore, if the guilty party in this room
wishes to admit his indiscretion,...

01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:39.116
..he will not only lessen
his sentence in Leavenworth Prison,...

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:42.835
..but save this company what I promise
will be pain and humiliation...

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:45.315
..beyond the endurance of man.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:56.271
I take it honour and integrity are traits
not to be found anywhere in this company.

01:18:56.400 --> 01:18:58.311
- Jerome?
- Yes, Sergeant.

01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:01.318
What would you do in my place?

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.352
I'm not in your place, Sergeant.

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:08.268
I know you write down everything
you see in that book of yours.

01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:11.949
Is there anything happened tonight
that might be of interest to me?

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.752
I was asleep, Sergeant.

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:16.952
If you weren't, you wouldn't
tell me anyway, would you?

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.514
No, I don't think I would.

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:23.189
Got me another Epstein
on my hands, don't l?

01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:29.674
OK, men, all base privileges
are cancelled.

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:33.877
All weekend passes, likewise, cancelled.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.958
The moral of this story is
when you get real horny,...

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:40.834
..do unto yourself what you would
otherwise do unto others.

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:44.796
Dismissed.

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:49.755
- What we gonna do about this?
- Don't say it.

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:52.440
Hey, I don't have to say it.

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:55.791
We all know who he's talkin' about.
You even wrote it in your book.

01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:58.957
Yeah. I also wrote down
that you're an animal.

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.594
If I'm right,
then you should be in the cavalry.

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:05.315
- Yeah?
- Hey, this is none of our business.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:08.193
Let's just let the army take care of this.

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:23.829
I'm sorry, Arnold.
I swear to God I'm sorry I ever wrote it.

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:28.156
Actually, I'm enjoying it.
Sounds like an Agatha Christie story:

01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.236
Sodomy on the Orient Express.

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:35.151
Hey, Epstein, let's see
if you'll be laughin' at Leavenworth.

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:38.630
And he calls me a cretin.

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:42.196
I don't see the big deal. A guy
should be able to do what he wants,...

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:44.880
..just as long as he doesn't do it to me.

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:47.912
That's a mistake, Gene.

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:52.989
Once you start compromising your
thoughts you're a candidate for mediocrity.

01:20:58.840 --> 01:21:02.799
There's nothing we can do about it
tonight. Let's hit the sack.

01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:12.631
I learnt a very important lesson that night.:
people believe whatever they read.

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:15.957
Something magical happens
once it's put down on paper.

01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:20.073
They figure no one would go to the trouble
of writing it down if it wasn"t the truth.

01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:22.794
Responsibility was my new watchword.

01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.277
Hey, MPs.

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.630
That Lindstrom guy must've talked.

01:21:58.760 --> 01:22:01.752
Jesus, you mean they'll pull
the guy out in front of everyone?

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:03.836
(whistle blows)

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:43.148
When the following
soldier's name is called,...

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:48.195
..he's requested to accompany
the military police back to headquarters.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:50.276
Hennesey, James J.

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:54.435
Wha... What's it about?

01:22:58.520 --> 01:23:02.069
That's a matter for you
to discuss with the authorities.

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.716
Come on, son.

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:48.790
Hennesey was the only guy in the platoon
who stood up for both Epstein and me.

01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:53.596
That fact didn't even occur to me
until I saw him being driven off to prison.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.274
(sounds the retreat)

01:24:16.280 --> 01:24:17.918
Boy, it's hot.

01:24:20.520 --> 01:24:22.875
Hey, come on. Let's go get a beer.

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:32.916
Arnold?

01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:38.756
Don't you wanna go?

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:42.993
Why do you think I'm a homosexual?

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.997
I don't know.

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:48.669
Maybe it's because
you never once talked about a girl.

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:54.349
I never talked about dogs, either.
Does that make me a cocker spaniel?

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:57.313
I know. I'll never do it again.

01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:59.997
(Toomey) Epstein?

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:05.596
Is it Epstein?

01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:08.911
Or "Epsteen"?

01:25:09.040 --> 01:25:11.600
- "Epsteen".
- "Epsteen"?

01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:18.670
I wonder if I may have
a word with you in private, please?

01:25:19.400 --> 01:25:21.914
Jesus. He's drunk as hell.

01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:25.153
Did you hear what I said... Epstein?

01:25:27.120 --> 01:25:31.432
Your insignificant presence
is requested in my chambers.

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:35.952
- You OK, sarge?
- Get outta here, Jerome,...

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:38.640
..before I start hatin' you again.

01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:42.594
If I kill the both of you,
they can still only hang me once.

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:46.034
Let's go, Epstein.

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:50.437
We've got some bills to pay up, you and l.

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:52.755
You and me.

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:55.394
Move your ass, sonny!

01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:59.593
- You don't wanna do this, sarge.
- But I do. I really, really do.

01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:03.428
- It's all right, Gene.
- No, it isn't.

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:06.358
Unless you wanna write
in your memoirs that you're dead,...

01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:08.710
..l'd move out if I were you, Gene, buddy.

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:10.990
Epstein, let's go, goddammit.

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:15.671
Don't do it, Arnold. He won't do
anything as long as I'm a witness.

01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:20.149
OK. Fine with me.

01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:22.316
Epstein, go clean the latrine.

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.311
Into my room, Jerome.

01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:36.398
You're now about
to move up to the front lines.

01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:38.513
Come on.

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:59.673
- Have a drink, Jerome.
- I don't drink whiskey, Sergeant.

01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:02.075
- You will tonight.
- Why?

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:04.156
Because I say so.

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:08.272
OK.

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:22.996
I don't like you, Jerome.

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:25.350
I never did. Never will.

01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:28.597
I won't even like you after the war.

01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:31.075
Well, I probably won't come up
all that often.

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:33.156
Probably won't.

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:36.156
Take a slug.

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:45.396
Tell me, Jerome,...

01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:51.516
..if a piss-drunk sergeant has
a loaded .45 pointed at the head...

01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:56.111
..of a piece of dung that the piss-drunk
sergeant hates and despises,...

01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:58.549
..how would you describe the situation?

01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:01.069
Delicate. Extremely delicate.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:02.155
Right.

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:07.833
He's going nuts! He's... he's...
he's gonna kill him! I'm telling you!

01:28:08.360 --> 01:28:14.515
I'll be honest with you, Jerome. It was
my intention of gettin' Epstein in here,...

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:17.840
..puttin' this pistol to his ear,...

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:23.711
..blowin' a tunnel through his head,
but you'll do just as well.

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:25.592
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:28:25.720 --> 01:28:30.475
There's somethin' about
you New York boys riles my ass.

01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:39.111
- You don't appreciate the army, do you?
- There are some things I like.

01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:41.196
Such as?

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:45.956
Mail. I like getting my mail.

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.473
You shittin' me?

01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:52.115
Piece of dung would never shit
a piss-drunk sergeant with a loaded .45.

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.676
Don't test me, Jerome. I'll bury ya.

01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:11.430
You know what the irony
of this situation is, Jerome?

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:15.599
The irony is that despite the fact...

01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:19.429
..you hate every
disciplined bone in my body,...

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:21.915
..you're gonna miss me when I go.

01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:25.075
Are you going somewhere, Sergeant?

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:28.632
Dickerson.

01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:31.156
veterans hospital.

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:34.676
0700 tomorrow morning.

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:39.199
I know how much
you boys are gonna miss me.

01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:42.630
Don't make a fuss or anything.
No gifts, you understand?

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:47.069
Well, the guys'll be disappointed,
but I'll explain why.

01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:51.120
Ingratitude.

01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:55.597
The army is gonna replace
my steel plate with sterling silver.

01:29:55.720 --> 01:30:00.271
That means I'll be able to hawk my head
in any pawnshop in this country.

01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:03.757
That's a joke, Jerome.

01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:06.075
I know. I love army humour.

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:08.270
How long will you be gone, Sergeant?

01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:13.190
They don't send you back from a veterans
hospital, boy. You become a veteran.

01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:15.550
I'm tryin' to tell you...

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:19.798
..my active career in the US Army
has been terminated.

01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:22.229
I'm finished. You understand?

01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:25.352
Retired before 40. That's sad, isn't it?

01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:29.196
- You find that sad, Jerome?
- Yes, it is sad.

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:34.713
One night, from my room here,...

01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:38.469
..l heard that game you played
with the men in the barracks.

01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:43.717
How each man could have his own
fantasy with only a week to live.

01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:48.156
I wanna play that game, Jerome.
Here's my five bucks.

01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:52.153
You tell me if I win.

01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:57.434
- You can't win, Sergeant. Game's over.
- Not yet. Not till I've had my turn.

01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:59.312
Right?

01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.956
You know what I would do...

01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:07.116
..with my last week on earth?

01:31:07.880 --> 01:31:12.749
I want to take one army misfit, dumb-ass,
subhuman, useless son of a bitch...

01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:14.836
..and turn him...

01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:19.837
..into an obedient, disciplined soldier
this army could be proud of.

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:24.509
I got two in this company -
you and Epstein.

01:31:26.440 --> 01:31:28.954
But Epstein's hopeless.

01:31:29.080 --> 01:31:31.514
You're my last hope, Jerome.

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:34.438
You're gonna make my fantasy come true.

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:36.994
None of them came true.
It was just a game.

01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:40.153
Right. Except tonight's the real thing.

01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:43.994
And I don't have a week to do it in.

01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:46.554
We're gonna do it now, soldier.

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:51.235
- On your feet, dogface!
- Sergeant, you're not in any condition...

01:31:51.360 --> 01:31:53.316
On your feet!

01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:57.196
Ten hut!

01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:09.831
A crime has been committed
in this room tonight, Jerome.

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:15.158
A noncommissioned officer has
threatened the life of an enlisted man,...

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:18.238
..brandishing a loaded weapon at him
without provocation...

01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:21.238
..while under the influence of alcohol.

01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:23.596
I am that officer, Jerome.

01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:28.919
It is your unquestioned duty to report
this incident to the proper authorities.

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:32.674
That's OK. I didn't mind.

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:35.519
As I'm piss-drunk and dangerous,...

01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:39.030
..it's also your duty
to relieve me of my loaded weapon.

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:43.631
I could just leave
and I would never talk about it.

01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:46.320
Take my weapon, goddammit.

01:32:46.440 --> 01:32:49.830
What do you mean "take it"?
How am I supposed to take it?

01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:54.476
Demand it, you weasel bastard.
I'll blow your puny brains out.

01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:56.556
OK. OK. Um...

01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:00.474
- May I have your gun, Sergeant?
- Pistol, turdhead!

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:03.068
May I have your pistol, Sergeant?

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.351
- Force it out of my hand.
- Force it out of your hand?

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:11.271
- How am I supposed to force it out?
- Grab my wrist, if you dare.

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:16.030
- I can't. You're stronger than I am.
- Grab it or I'll shoot, goddamn you!

01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.558
OK.

01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:34.875
OK. Thank you.

01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:38.151
Now, why don't you just...

01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:41.033
..try to get a good night's sleep?

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:45.237
To properly charge me,
you need witnesses.

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:47.920
Assemble the men outside the barracks.

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:51.635
Well, l... I took your gun.
Aren't you satisfied? I am.

01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:56.436
It's regulations. As long as
you obey regulations, I win the bet.

01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:59.796
Assemble the men.

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:07.156
Oh.

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:08.952
Hi, fellas.

01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:12.035
Um...

01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:16.233
Would you come outside for a minute?
Sergeant wants to speak to us.

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:39.071
Men, as you can see,...

01:34:41.320 --> 01:34:43.959
..l'm piss-drunk.

01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:48.790
I've also just threatened
to blow Private Jerome's brains out.

01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:52.196
Private Jerome has
relieved me of my weapon,...

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:55.312
..placed me under arrest.
You're all witnesses.

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:58.910
Before takin' me
to headquarters to file charges,...

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:04.398
..l'd just like to add that Private Jerome
has displayed outstanding courage...

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:08.433
..and carried out his duty
in the manner of a first-class soldier.

01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:12.348
I am puttin' him up for commendation.
I'm ready to go, Jerome.

01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:15.950
I think that's a decision that
should be left to the men, Sergeant.

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:17.752
Is that right?

01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:19.518
That's right.

01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:20.993
Hm.

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:26.076
Private Epstein,...

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:30.588
..in your opinion should
we drop the charges or not?

01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:34.710
No. No charges.

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:39.958
I think the sergeant should get
company punishment like the rest of us.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:46.516
- Would that be all right, Sergeant?
- My two misfits are in charge, huh?

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:51.873
Fine. Handle this any way you want,
as long as justice is served.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.070
You name it, Epstein.

01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:56.634
I think justice would be served...

01:35:56.760 --> 01:35:59.194
..if you gave us 200 push-ups.

01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:02.314
very decisive.

01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:04.954
That's a disciplined soldier for you, men.

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:07.556
Thank you.

01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:12.635
- Hit the dirt?
- Hit the dirt!

01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:17.753
- Count off?
- What?

01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:20.838
- Tell me to count off!
- Right. Count off!

01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:22.757
Yes, Private Epstein.

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:25.678
One, two, three,...

01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:28.394
..four, five, six,...

01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:31.717
..seven, eight, nine, ten,...

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:35.071
..eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,...

01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:40.149
..fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,
eighteen, nineteen, twenty...

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:45.670
We never saw Sergeant Toomey again.

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:49.110
Our new sergeant was
a sane, logical and decent man.

01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:53.756
After four weeks with him we realised
how much we missed Sergeant Toomey.

01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:57.634
One should never underestimate
the stimulation of eccentricity.

01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:02.433
I told Daisy I was shipping out and that
this was the last time we'd have together.

01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:05.950
She said "I know you'll find
another girl some day, Gene,...

01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:10.153
..but you"Il never forget me because
we"Il always be each other's first love. "

01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:14.239
Long after the war I ran into Daisy
in New York. She still looked great.

01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:16.669
She married a doctor from New Orleans.

01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:19.189
Her name is now Daisy Horowitz.

01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:22.073
Ah, well, Biloxi was beautiful.

01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:27.910
We were going to the Battle of the Pacific
and there was no one who wasn't scared.

01:37:28.040 --> 01:37:32.875
Then they dropped a bomb on Hiroshima
and six days later the war was over.

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:38.354
So when you get down to it the only action
we ever saw was up in Rowena's place.

01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:40.755
Sure, we were glad
our lives were spared,...

01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:44.634
..but the guys who came before us and
the ones who didn't make it back home...

01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:47.320
..haunted me for the rest of my life.

01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:52.519
Roy Selridge decided
to make the army his career,...

01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:55.438
..and 18 years later
he was still a buck private.

01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:57.949
I guess he never really did hit his peak.

01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:02.674
Joseph Wykowski became a high-school
football coach in Albany, New York.

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:07.237
He's married with six kids,
weighs 280 pounds and has an ulcer.

01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:10.238
He's on a low-fat cottage cheese diet.

01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:16.189
Don Carney became a school teacher and
he's someone the kids can really count on.

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:20.233
He never got married, and
he enjoys singing in his church choir.

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:26.271
Epstein became a lawyer and eventually
the District Attorney of Brooklyn.

01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:29.631
The Mafia calls him
"The most feared man in New York. "

01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:37.237
As for me, I finally found the perfect girl, I
got married and had two great daughters.

01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:41.911
I became a writer. I wrote a few plays and
ljust finished one called "Biloxi Blues".

01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:46.556
Everything in it is true, except Rowena
never gave me a second one for free.

01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:50.434
Maybe l"Il leave that out
if they ever make it into a movie.

01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:55.151
As I look back now, a lot ofyears later,...

01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:59.193
..l realise my time in the army
was the happiest time of my life.

01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:01.436
God knows not because I liked the army,...

01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:04.472
..and there sure was
nothing to like about a war.

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:07.478
I liked it for the most selfish reason of all.:

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:09.431
because I was young.

01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:12.438
We all were.
Me and Epstein and Wykowski,...

01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:14.630
..Selridge, Carney, Hennesey...

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:16.830
..and even Sergeant Toomey.

01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:19.269
I didn't really like
most of those guys then,...

01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:22.551
..but today I love every damn one of them.

01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:25.676
Life is weird, you know?

01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:16.034
(# "Goodbye, Dear, l"Il Be Back
in a Year" by Dick Robertson)

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:24.274
# Goodbye, dear, l"Il be back in a year

01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:28.757
# Cos l"m in the army now

01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:33.076
# They took my number out of a hat

01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:37.955
# And there's nothing a guy
can do about that

01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:42.517
# But when I get back
l"Il be all tanned and brown

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:46.633
# And we'll buy that cottage
