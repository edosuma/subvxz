00:00.219 --> 00:02.039
Previously on <i>Longmire</i>

00:02.159 --> 00:03.114
Ignore the polls.

00:03.662 --> 00:06.382
I do. But there are some things
I cann't ignore.

00:06.502 --> 00:08.553
You know what would help?
Dirt.

00:08.673 --> 00:12.127
You got any juicy Longmire secrets,
now would be the time to spill 'em.

00:12.247 --> 00:13.991
Where did you get those eyes?

00:14.111 --> 00:17.824
My dad and my ex-boyfriend are in
the middle of a nasty campaign fight.

00:17.944 --> 00:20.258
- And recently I found out that my mother...
- Your mother what?

00:20.378 --> 00:22.977
- I know what happened in Denver.
- No you don't.

00:23.097 --> 00:25.850
Word of your wifes' murder
won't leave this room.

00:25.970 --> 00:29.789
But I think that right now your daughter
might need you more than the county does.

00:31.861 --> 00:33.061
Your family's
been coming here

00:33.162 --> 00:34.796
every summer since the '80s,
right?

00:34.864 --> 00:36.598
The '70s, actually.
And we're here year-round now,

00:36.699 --> 00:38.433
so I can finally vote for you.

00:38.501 --> 00:40.068
We just got to get out
that vote!

00:40.136 --> 00:43.004
May I borrow the sheriff
for just a moment?

00:43.105 --> 00:44.506
Uh, what for?

00:44.607 --> 00:46.441
I think she's asking you
to dance.

00:46.509 --> 00:48.076
I'm not sure that's such a...
such a...

00:48.144 --> 00:50.245
Go on.
Come on!

01:06.262 --> 01:07.862
All right, sheriff!

01:09.765 --> 01:12.367
Nice one, Walt.

01:13.703 --> 01:15.637
Hung me out to dry there.

01:15.705 --> 01:18.139
Price of politics.

01:18.240 --> 01:20.342
You, uh, want to dance?

01:20.443 --> 01:23.278
Two vodka tonics, ma'am.

01:23.346 --> 01:25.246
Thank you.

01:28.250 --> 01:29.851
Ruby.

01:29.952 --> 01:31.219
Ooh, thank you.
Mm-hmm.

01:31.320 --> 01:33.388
I thought maybe you got lost.

01:33.489 --> 01:35.023
That block of ice was charming,

01:35.124 --> 01:36.491
but it's not a very efficient
way to make a drink.

01:37.593 --> 01:38.893
Look at Ferg.

01:38.995 --> 01:41.296
Ooh, light on his feet.

01:41.397 --> 01:43.298
You go, boy!

02:15.431 --> 02:19.668
I have been asked to say a few
words about tomorrow's election.

02:19.769 --> 02:24.072
We have all grown accustomed to
the modern drumbeat for change.

02:24.173 --> 02:27.342
Our opponent seems particularly
fond of the word.

02:27.410 --> 02:30.578
And while I believe
that change can be good,

02:30.680 --> 02:34.182
I do think people too often
underestimate the value

02:34.283 --> 02:36.117
of things that never change.

02:38.788 --> 02:42.957
My friend Walt
is one of those things.

02:46.462 --> 02:49.264
Who would ask him to change
his loyalty,

02:49.365 --> 02:51.533
his honesty,

02:51.634 --> 02:53.935
his intelligence,
and compassion?

02:54.003 --> 02:55.870
Not me.

02:55.971 --> 02:57.305
Though some of us <i>do</i> think

02:57.373 --> 02:58.973
that maybe it is time
he got a cellphone.

03:00.176 --> 03:04.245
But other than that, sheriff.

03:04.346 --> 03:05.313
Speech!

03:05.414 --> 03:08.283
Speech!

03:20.996 --> 03:23.098
Thataboy, Walt!

03:24.834 --> 03:25.767
Uh...

03:25.835 --> 03:27.268
Okay?

03:28.604 --> 03:32.540
Uh...

03:36.078 --> 03:38.646
Thanks.

03:52.094 --> 03:55.997
Walt, come on.
That's not necessary.

03:56.098 --> 03:58.299
I'll get that in the morning.

03:58.367 --> 04:01.503
Doesn't seem right to leave you
with a mess.

04:01.570 --> 04:05.273
Who said anything
about you leaving?

04:05.374 --> 04:07.108
Hmm?

04:27.730 --> 04:29.864
I'm sorry. I...

04:29.932 --> 04:32.367
I got a big day.

04:32.468 --> 04:34.302
Yeah, got to get your rest.

04:34.403 --> 04:36.237
Right.

04:36.305 --> 04:38.640
I, uh... yeah.

05:21.450 --> 05:23.451
Hello?

05:24.854 --> 05:27.121
Dad?

05:54.149 --> 05:56.150
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

05:56.218 --> 05:58.219
Hey. Hi. Oh.

05:59.755 --> 06:01.155
Thank you. Thank you.

06:01.223 --> 06:03.825
Thank you. You too. Oh.

06:03.926 --> 06:06.227
You got to be kidding me!

06:06.328 --> 06:08.429
Hey, we're stepping up
to retail politics now, man.

06:08.497 --> 06:09.797
Look at this.

06:09.865 --> 06:11.966
No, seriously.

06:12.034 --> 06:13.501
You know, a town this small,

06:13.602 --> 06:15.303
the whole thing could
come down to, you know,

06:15.404 --> 06:17.138
getting a few more of your
people to show up at the polls,

06:17.239 --> 06:18.406
a few less of the other guy's.

06:18.507 --> 06:20.008
Got to get the vote out.

06:20.109 --> 06:21.609
In this thing?
Yeah.

06:21.677 --> 06:24.812
Dress for the job you want,
not the job you have.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.514
The job I want is sheriff,

06:26.582 --> 06:28.850
not '80s heavy-metal
lead singer.

06:28.951 --> 06:30.518
I think I'll take my own car.

06:30.586 --> 06:32.186
- Nah!
- Yeah.

06:32.288 --> 06:33.788
Aw.

06:33.889 --> 06:35.256
Look at this.
He's gonna take his own car.

06:35.324 --> 06:36.457
Man of the people.

06:36.558 --> 06:37.759
Thank you.

06:41.230 --> 06:45.566
Walt has rubbed off on you
more than you realize.

06:47.469 --> 06:48.603
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:48.704 --> 06:51.172
Cady, what brings <i>you</i> here?

06:51.240 --> 06:54.108
Oh, I just came to wish my
dad luck on the big day. Oh.

06:54.209 --> 06:55.376
Oh, he hasn't
come in yet today.

06:55.477 --> 06:56.844
That's weird.
I was just at his house,

06:56.946 --> 06:58.146
and there was no sign of him.

06:58.247 --> 07:00.181
Oh, maybe he stopped to vote.

07:00.249 --> 07:01.866
Why don't you have a cup of coffee
and wait for him?

07:01.986 --> 07:02.832
Oh, um...

07:02.952 --> 07:05.720
Thanks, but I promised Henry
I'd go get out the vote.

07:05.788 --> 07:08.656
You know, a lot of people
on the Res don't have cars,

07:08.757 --> 07:11.392
so I'm gonna shuttle them
to their polling places.

07:11.493 --> 07:13.461
See you guys later.

07:29.979 --> 07:31.145
Bob.

07:31.246 --> 07:32.246
Huh?

07:32.348 --> 07:34.315
How did you get in here?

07:34.416 --> 07:35.850
Through the front door.

07:35.951 --> 07:38.853
The front door has been locked
since 2:00 A.M.

07:38.954 --> 07:41.356
Well, I fell asleep
in the bathroom,

07:41.423 --> 07:44.525
and then I came out here
and everyone was gone,

07:44.626 --> 07:47.695
the door was locked,
and I fell asleep out here.

07:47.796 --> 07:49.864
After helping yourself
to some drinks.

07:49.932 --> 07:51.899
And food.

07:51.967 --> 07:53.935
Look, I didn't mean to steal
anything, Henry.

07:54.036 --> 07:55.536
You know that.
I just...

07:55.604 --> 07:58.272
There just wasn't anybody here
to serve me.

07:58.340 --> 08:01.909
Why did you not think to call
someone to come get you?

08:01.977 --> 08:04.946
Well, I would have called
my lady friend,

08:05.047 --> 08:08.616
but Yelena broke up with me,
if you can believe it.

08:08.717 --> 08:09.951
Heartbreak or no,

08:10.052 --> 08:12.220
you need to call someone
to come pick you up.

08:19.228 --> 08:22.030
I was starting to wonder
if you were even gonna show up.

08:22.131 --> 08:24.232
I just wanted to wait for
the lunch crowd to clear out.

08:24.333 --> 08:26.034
Yeah, makes sense.

08:26.135 --> 08:28.903
Any idea which way
things are leaning?

08:29.004 --> 08:31.305
I can't tell you
anything like that.

08:31.407 --> 08:32.640
You know that.

08:32.707 --> 08:34.442
Just one?

08:49.358 --> 08:51.826
They took away
my driver's license

08:51.894 --> 08:53.795
on account of my vision.

08:53.896 --> 08:56.898
I didn't think I was
gonna be able to vote.

08:56.999 --> 08:58.599
Well, I'm happy to help.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.568
You know who I voted for?

09:00.636 --> 09:03.237
It's really none
of my business.

09:03.338 --> 09:06.174
Longmire!

09:08.010 --> 09:09.844
All right.
Now, you all know me.

09:09.912 --> 09:12.346
I'm an Indian,
and I'm proud of my heritage.

09:12.448 --> 09:16.150
So you must understand how
strongly I believe in this man

09:16.251 --> 09:19.487
when I say to you
we all need to forget the past.

09:19.555 --> 09:21.656
It's time to look to the future.

09:21.723 --> 09:25.326
The future has stepped out
of his patrol car as we speak.

09:25.427 --> 09:27.929
Give it up
for Mr. Branch Connally!

09:27.996 --> 09:29.263
Thank you.

09:33.268 --> 09:36.771
Get 'em, big guy.

09:36.839 --> 09:39.207
Thank you very much.

09:39.274 --> 09:41.342
Think fast!

09:41.443 --> 09:43.711
Looking good, people.

09:43.812 --> 09:45.680
Hey, Henry.

09:45.747 --> 09:48.015
Thought you could use these.

09:48.117 --> 09:49.984
He was supposed to hand them out
to people,

09:50.085 --> 09:51.619
and I found them in a closet.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.287
Oh, yes. He preferred to run
a <i>silent</i> campaign.

09:54.756 --> 09:55.890
Can I get you something to eat?

09:55.991 --> 09:57.225
Yeah, sure.

09:57.292 --> 09:58.693
I wouldn't mind
a little something.

09:58.794 --> 10:00.461
Oh.

10:00.562 --> 10:01.963
Hey.

10:02.064 --> 10:03.564
Hey, Vic.
Sorry to bug you.

10:03.665 --> 10:05.199
I didn't think I should bother
Branch or Walt.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.534
What's up, Ferg?

10:06.635 --> 10:08.369
Somebody just called in
a car accident.

10:08.470 --> 10:09.637
Sucks.

10:09.738 --> 10:11.072
I know.

10:11.173 --> 10:12.907
And I got to stay here
Manning the phones

10:13.008 --> 10:14.675
until Ruby finishes
counting the votes.

10:14.743 --> 10:18.412
No, it's fine.
Tell me where I have to go.

10:54.016 --> 10:55.416
Sheriff's station.

10:55.484 --> 10:56.784
Hey, Ferg.
It's me.

10:56.852 --> 10:58.753
So, I'm out here
at this accident site.

10:58.854 --> 11:01.789
It's the weirdest thing.

11:01.857 --> 11:03.724
It's like a double hit and run.

11:03.825 --> 11:05.560
Who'd you say called this in?

11:05.661 --> 11:07.094
Guy didn't leave his name.

11:07.196 --> 11:08.896
He just said he saw the wreck
as he drove by.

11:28.183 --> 11:32.753
Ferg, send an ambulance
right away, okay?

11:34.923 --> 11:37.225
Cady.

11:57.844 --> 12:01.142
Walt.
We just spoke to the head of trauma.

12:01.243 --> 12:03.311
She was unresponsive
when she came into the E.R.,

12:03.412 --> 12:04.879
so they rushed her
straight to surgery.

12:04.980 --> 12:06.647
It's gonna be a few more hours

12:06.715 --> 12:07.915
depending on what they find.

12:14.356 --> 12:16.257
Walt, did you hear
what we said?

12:16.358 --> 12:19.360
Oh, my God.

12:19.461 --> 12:21.929
I just heard.
She okay?

12:21.997 --> 12:24.832
I need to take a walk.

12:26.735 --> 12:28.402
Okay.

12:28.504 --> 12:31.272
<i>Oncology,</i>
<i>paging palliative services...</i>

12:31.373 --> 12:33.007
<i>Extension 3609.</i>

12:40.282 --> 12:42.783
She okay?

12:42.885 --> 12:45.720
It's hard to say.
She was in surgery.

12:45.821 --> 12:47.955
It's pretty bad, though.

12:48.056 --> 12:50.424
Just wish there was something
we could do.

12:50.526 --> 12:53.094
Well, we could find
the son of a bitch who hit her.

12:53.195 --> 12:55.863
You're right.

12:57.199 --> 12:59.100
Looks like
you took some photos.

12:59.201 --> 13:00.601
Yeah.

13:00.702 --> 13:03.070
So, I went out there,
and as far as I can tell,

13:03.172 --> 13:05.406
Cady was out of the car
changing a flat tire.

13:05.474 --> 13:10.945
I found car Jack
and these lug nuts

13:11.065 --> 13:12.114
on the side of the road.

13:12.234 --> 13:17.285
Now, when the Pontiac
smashed into her wagon...

13:17.386 --> 13:21.822
It must have sent her flying.

13:23.725 --> 13:25.259
It's okay, Ferg.

13:25.360 --> 13:28.062
How could somebody
do something like this

13:28.163 --> 13:30.231
and then just leave the scene?

13:30.299 --> 13:31.666
I know.

13:34.570 --> 13:36.270
So, who owns that car?

13:36.371 --> 13:38.673
No plates, and I couldn't
get through the door,

13:38.740 --> 13:40.775
so I broke through
the passenger window

13:40.842 --> 13:42.643
and I checked
the glove compartment

13:42.744 --> 13:46.314
and found
a expired registration.

13:46.381 --> 13:50.484
Guy named Darren Tooman
in Montana is listed on it.

13:50.552 --> 13:52.920
<i>And</i> I found a fifth of bourbon

13:53.021 --> 13:55.423
on the front seat on the floor.

13:55.524 --> 13:57.258
Now, I know that with Ruby away

13:57.359 --> 13:58.826
somebody's supposed to be here,

13:58.927 --> 14:01.028
but I'm going to Montana to
find the owner of that car.

14:01.129 --> 14:03.764
Shoot.

14:03.832 --> 14:07.134
We got voicemail.
I'm going with you.

14:10.672 --> 14:13.507
Hey, Ferg.
No sticker?

14:13.575 --> 14:15.042
What?

14:15.110 --> 14:17.378
Don't forget to do
your civic duty today.

14:17.479 --> 14:18.813
I <i>am</i> doing my civic duty.

14:18.914 --> 14:20.214
Why's <i>he</i> so upset?

14:20.315 --> 14:22.183
Because his friend,
your ex-girlfriend,

14:22.284 --> 14:25.119
is in critical condition
after getting hit by a car.

14:25.220 --> 14:27.054
Cady?

14:27.122 --> 14:28.389
Yeah.

14:42.004 --> 14:44.805
Careful, Ferg.

14:44.906 --> 14:48.676
Paper on the windows can
sometimes mean meth house, okay?

15:01.089 --> 15:02.757
Oh, shit!

15:02.858 --> 15:04.125
Ferg.

15:07.095 --> 15:08.596
Darren Tooman?

15:08.664 --> 15:09.697
Yeah?

15:09.765 --> 15:10.931
Get up.
Okay.

15:11.033 --> 15:13.267
Come on with us.

15:13.368 --> 15:16.037
I owned that Sprint
since high school,

15:16.138 --> 15:17.738
but it was just sitting
in the yard,

15:17.839 --> 15:19.240
so I sold it a few months ago.

15:19.308 --> 15:21.075
There's no record
of that sale, Darren.

15:21.143 --> 15:23.377
Well, I sold it on Craigslist.

15:23.478 --> 15:24.779
The guy paid cash.

15:24.880 --> 15:27.348
He kind of...
He overpaid, to be honest,

15:27.416 --> 15:28.849
but I sent in my part,

15:28.950 --> 15:31.285
the transfer of sale
to the state of Montana.

15:31.386 --> 15:33.387
But if the buyer didn't file
his paperwork,

15:33.488 --> 15:34.789
the sale never posted.

15:34.856 --> 15:37.224
That car is still
legally registered to you.

15:37.326 --> 15:41.028
Can you describe the guy
that bought the car, anything?

15:41.129 --> 15:44.598
'Cause if you don't, you might
be liable for manslaughter.

15:44.700 --> 15:47.301
Oh, well, he was a white guy,

15:47.402 --> 15:52.273
a brown baseball cap,
and he called himself "K-Dawg."

16:05.153 --> 16:07.855
Any news?

16:09.958 --> 16:12.760
No.

16:18.333 --> 16:21.569
Yeah... uh...

16:21.670 --> 16:23.437
Coffee or something?

16:26.074 --> 16:28.843
No.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.186
Great. Great.
Thanks. Okay!

17:01.287 --> 17:03.689
K-Dawg, the guy who responded
to the Craigslist ad,

17:03.790 --> 17:05.290
is Kellen Dawes,

17:05.391 --> 17:07.960
and he lives in the county
right on the Montana border.

17:08.060 --> 17:09.595
Let's get there!

17:09.695 --> 17:12.396
Hey, Ferg. I know that you want
to do a good job for Walt,

17:12.498 --> 17:13.799
but you need to
take it down a notch.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.534
Why? Why do I need to take it
down a notch?

17:15.602 --> 17:17.135
I want to find this guy,
and I want to...

17:17.237 --> 17:19.871
And what?
You want to do <i>what?</i>

17:19.973 --> 17:21.406
You want to hurt him?

17:21.507 --> 17:22.907
Because if you go out there
like this, all jacked up,

17:23.009 --> 17:24.542
you're gonna do
something stupid.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.578
You're either gonna
get yourself in trouble

17:26.679 --> 17:28.814
or you're gonna get the bad guy
<i>out</i> of trouble.

17:31.517 --> 17:35.821
Maybe I should go talk
to Kellen Dawes by myself.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.225
Yeah.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.327
Yeah, maybe you should.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.966
It's gonna be okay.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.008
You know,
it's supposed to be them

17:56.109 --> 17:59.077
sitting out here
and us in there.

17:59.145 --> 18:01.079
They're supposed to break
their leg on a trampoline

18:01.147 --> 18:03.148
or get stitches when their hand
slips carving a pumpkin,

18:03.249 --> 18:05.017
you know?

18:05.118 --> 18:09.254
It's not
supposed to be like this.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.128
My, uh, my son Troy,

18:16.195 --> 18:18.797
he's a football player,
a damn good one.

18:18.898 --> 18:21.533
And then suddenly
out of nowhere,

18:21.601 --> 18:23.835
he just starts losing
all this weight.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.804
I mean, it's crazy.

18:25.905 --> 18:27.673
Like 30 pounds in a few weeks.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.941
And they
don't know what's wrong.

18:30.043 --> 18:31.510
Centuries of science

18:31.611 --> 18:35.147
and they can't tell me
what's wrong with my son.

18:35.248 --> 18:38.784
It's our fault.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.422
We're supposed
to take care of them.

18:45.358 --> 18:48.694
We forget to and start thinking
about ourselves.

18:48.795 --> 18:54.399
We go out
and have a good day...

19:07.246 --> 19:10.415
Thinking
about our own happiness

19:10.516 --> 19:12.184
instead of theirs.

19:12.251 --> 19:15.721
The world decides
to even things out.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.230
Kellen Dawes?

19:25.331 --> 19:26.531
Yes?

19:28.267 --> 19:32.204
You mind putting the gun down,
showing me your hands?

19:32.271 --> 19:34.072
I do.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.441
But I will anyways.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.050
Thanks.

19:47.703 --> 19:49.437
That's a nice rifle.

19:49.538 --> 19:52.307
Only because I take care of it.

19:52.408 --> 19:54.909
I can see that.

19:54.977 --> 19:58.713
I'm more interested in a car,
an old Sprint.

19:58.814 --> 20:00.548
You know that car?

20:00.616 --> 20:01.983
'Course I do.

20:02.084 --> 20:03.752
Worst $500 I ever spent.

20:03.819 --> 20:06.821
And a couple weeks ago,
somebody stole it.

20:06.889 --> 20:09.157
Why didn't you
report it stolen?

20:09.258 --> 20:11.326
Why do you even care
about that stupid car?

20:11.427 --> 20:13.428
'Cause it was involved
in a hit and run.

20:13.529 --> 20:15.497
That's really too bad.

20:15.598 --> 20:17.065
Everybody okay?

20:17.166 --> 20:18.466
No.

20:18.534 --> 20:20.568
Well...

20:20.636 --> 20:22.637
I can tell you I didn't have
nothing to do with it.

20:22.738 --> 20:26.674
Then you won't mind me taking
a look around your property?

20:26.776 --> 20:28.610
Knock yourself out.

21:04.446 --> 21:07.715
So, what are we doing
to find the guy that hit Cady?

21:07.817 --> 21:11.719
What are <i>we</i> doing?

21:11.821 --> 21:14.189
Well, Vic and I
went to Montana and back,

21:14.290 --> 21:16.991
but I'm not really sure
what <i>you've</i> been doing.

21:17.092 --> 21:19.460
You... you pissed at me?

21:19.562 --> 21:23.631
Honestly, I've been pissed
at you for months now.

21:23.732 --> 21:26.067
Me?

21:26.168 --> 21:28.069
What'd I do?

21:28.170 --> 21:31.906
You could've dated <i>anybody.</i>

21:33.909 --> 21:36.477
Why'd it have to be Cady?

21:39.281 --> 21:42.150
Wow. Uh...

21:42.251 --> 21:45.520
I had no idea
that you even liked her.

21:45.621 --> 21:48.656
Yeah, well, there you have it.

21:52.027 --> 21:53.361
I don't know what to say.

21:53.462 --> 21:54.662
Just forget it.

22:05.541 --> 22:08.743
Where'd they take the cars?

22:08.844 --> 22:10.111
Print shed.

22:14.350 --> 22:16.451
You want to come along?

22:16.552 --> 22:21.222
No, I got to... stay here
in case Vic calls.

23:07.770 --> 23:11.572
She's gonna be okay, Walt.

23:23.385 --> 23:26.487
Uh...

23:26.588 --> 23:30.959
Thought you'd want to know
where we stand with the driver.

23:31.026 --> 23:36.531
The owner of record sold the car
to a guy named Kellen Dawes.

23:36.598 --> 23:41.970
Kellen says the car was stolen
a couple weeks ago.

23:42.037 --> 23:46.708
Whoever drove the car
left behind blood.

23:46.775 --> 23:50.678
There'd be cuts,
scrapes, worse.

23:52.548 --> 23:54.515
Kellen didn't have any
that I can see,

23:54.583 --> 23:56.284
so I'm inclined to believe him.

23:56.385 --> 23:59.520
Checked at all the hospitals

23:59.588 --> 24:02.056
to see if anyone's come in
with consistent injuries

24:02.157 --> 24:03.825
in the last 24 hours,
and, uh...

24:03.926 --> 24:06.828
Nothing.

24:06.929 --> 24:11.666
So I guess...

24:11.767 --> 24:15.370
That I'm nowhere.

24:20.409 --> 24:23.044
I'm so sorry, Walt.

24:23.145 --> 24:25.713
Check the drug stores.

24:25.781 --> 24:28.182
Security cameras.

24:28.283 --> 24:33.354
Look for anybody who came in
to buy first-aid supplies...

24:33.422 --> 24:37.358
Gauze, bandages, disinfectant.

24:37.426 --> 24:39.093
After what they did,

24:39.161 --> 24:43.264
they'd stay away from hospitals,
doctor's offices.

24:43.332 --> 24:45.500
Okay.

24:53.142 --> 24:55.576
Hey, Walt.

24:55.677 --> 24:59.013
You won.

24:59.114 --> 25:01.215
What?

25:03.886 --> 25:06.521
The election.

25:09.491 --> 25:11.125
Oh.

26:02.044 --> 26:03.978
We must have
gone through

26:04.079 --> 26:06.747
half the pharmacy security tapes
in Montana.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.783
I got a couple left.

26:08.884 --> 26:10.418
What are we supposed to do

26:10.519 --> 26:13.121
if our mystery driver had all
the first-aid stuff on hand?

26:13.222 --> 26:15.189
We're supposed to try
everything, right?

26:15.257 --> 26:16.657
No, I know.

26:18.060 --> 26:19.193
Just seems like
a long-shot.

26:19.261 --> 26:21.796
I got one.
Check this out, Vic.

26:23.732 --> 26:25.032
Oh, my God.

26:25.134 --> 26:26.300
I know.

26:26.368 --> 26:28.002
Bandages,

26:28.103 --> 26:29.604
pain meds, ice packs.

26:29.705 --> 26:32.006
No, I know that guy.

26:32.074 --> 26:35.176
That's the kid that said
that his car was stolen.

26:35.277 --> 26:36.511
That's Kellen Dawes.

26:46.388 --> 26:48.489
Kellen?

26:50.325 --> 26:51.526
Kellen, stop!

27:06.408 --> 27:08.709
What are you doing?

27:08.777 --> 27:10.378
I'm in Montana now.

27:10.479 --> 27:12.213
You don't have jurisdiction
over here.

27:12.314 --> 27:13.548
<i>That's</i> the state line?
Yeah.

27:13.615 --> 27:15.483
That's the state line
right there.

27:15.584 --> 27:16.717
How can you be so sure?

27:16.785 --> 27:18.786
I've lived here all my life.

27:18.887 --> 27:20.955
I know where the state line is.

27:21.056 --> 27:22.023
Yeah.

27:22.124 --> 27:23.491
Hey!

27:25.694 --> 27:26.827
Hey, you can't do this.

27:26.895 --> 27:28.362
You don't have authority
over here!

27:28.430 --> 27:30.198
You're overlooking one thing,
Kellen.

27:30.299 --> 27:32.400
I don't give a shit whether or
not I have authority in Montana.

27:32.501 --> 27:34.135
You hit a girl with your car
and you ran.

27:34.236 --> 27:36.704
You're under arrest!
It wasn't me. I swear.

27:36.805 --> 27:39.006
Then what were you doing
buying first-aid supplies

27:39.074 --> 27:40.975
at a pharmacy an hour
after the accident?

27:41.076 --> 27:42.243
It was for a friend!

27:42.344 --> 27:43.544
I loaned him my car!

27:43.612 --> 27:45.213
He came back all messed up.

27:45.314 --> 27:46.847
<i>What</i> friend?

27:59.328 --> 28:00.995
Bob!

28:02.764 --> 28:03.864
Open up!

28:03.966 --> 28:07.902
Billy, where's your dad?

28:08.003 --> 28:09.003
He's not here.

28:09.071 --> 28:10.871
Ow!
You're hurting me!

28:10.973 --> 28:12.506
You're under arrest!
Get up!

28:12.608 --> 28:14.108
What?
What did I ever do?

28:14.176 --> 28:16.677
You hit my daughter with a car
and left her to die!

28:16.778 --> 28:18.546
Get in!

28:48.477 --> 28:51.112
How drunk were you?

28:51.213 --> 28:54.148
I wasn't. I swear.

28:54.250 --> 28:55.583
Bullshit.

28:55.684 --> 28:58.086
Found a fifth of bourbon
in the front seat,

28:58.187 --> 29:00.054
not to mention the fact
that you felt the need

29:00.155 --> 29:02.056
to flee the scene
of the accident.

29:02.157 --> 29:03.658
Nobody does that...

29:03.759 --> 29:05.894
Unless they have something
to hide, so...

29:05.995 --> 29:07.562
How drunk were you?!

29:07.663 --> 29:11.065
I told you...
I wasn't drunk.

29:11.166 --> 29:14.936
I mean...

29:15.037 --> 29:17.238
Not very.

29:17.339 --> 29:18.640
But I was okay to drive.

29:18.741 --> 29:21.676
My unconscious daughter...

29:21.777 --> 29:24.379
Would argue otherwise.

29:26.415 --> 29:29.617
My dad called me
from the Red Pony,

29:29.718 --> 29:32.320
and he asked me
for a ride home.

29:32.421 --> 29:33.922
And my car's in the shop,

29:34.023 --> 29:36.124
so I borrowed
my friend Kellen's.

29:36.225 --> 29:38.359
And while I was on my way over
to get dad,

29:38.460 --> 29:39.761
Kellen texted me.

29:41.363 --> 29:43.798
I didn't think it was
a big deal to read it, but...

29:43.899 --> 29:47.135
I must have taken my eyes
off of the road for a second.

29:47.236 --> 29:50.538
And that's when I hit
the parked car.

29:50.639 --> 29:52.540
I was dazed
'cause I hit my head.

29:52.641 --> 29:54.842
I didn't even see
your daughter at first.

29:54.944 --> 29:56.644
It wasn't until after I got out

29:56.745 --> 29:58.346
that I saw her
over in the grass.

29:58.447 --> 29:59.614
If you saw her...

29:59.715 --> 30:01.716
Why did you run?

30:01.817 --> 30:05.286
I was sc... I was scared.

30:05.387 --> 30:07.722
You realize she could have died
if nobody found her?!

30:07.823 --> 30:09.390
I'm so sorry, sheriff.

30:09.491 --> 30:13.394
I did call 911.
I swear.

30:13.495 --> 30:16.164
Book him.

30:16.265 --> 30:18.900
Driving while intoxicated,

30:19.001 --> 30:21.336
reckless endangerment,

30:21.437 --> 30:24.639
driving an
unregistered vehicle,

30:24.740 --> 30:27.508
fleeing the scene
of an accident...

30:27.609 --> 30:30.778
And anything else
you can think of.

30:40.990 --> 30:42.156
Yeah?

30:42.257 --> 30:43.358
Morning, Branch.

30:43.459 --> 30:44.892
Look, I know it sucks,

30:44.994 --> 30:47.328
but that was no way
to handle it.

30:47.429 --> 30:49.097
What are you talking about?

30:49.198 --> 30:51.232
I had a room
full of people, man,

30:51.333 --> 30:52.567
60 supporters of yours

30:52.668 --> 30:55.003
waiting to drown their sorrows
with you,

30:55.104 --> 30:56.738
and you don't even show up.

30:56.839 --> 30:59.207
Can't get you on the phone.

30:59.308 --> 31:01.342
Nobody likes
losing an election,

31:01.443 --> 31:03.745
especially not
by such a slim margin.

31:03.846 --> 31:05.580
How slim was it?

31:05.681 --> 31:07.849
You lost by 17 votes.

31:07.950 --> 31:09.550
And if you want to win
the next one,

31:09.651 --> 31:11.619
you're gonna have to learn
to give the people

31:11.720 --> 31:13.388
who helped you
a little more respect.

31:13.489 --> 31:16.257
Honestly, Jacob,

31:16.358 --> 31:18.559
I got bigger things
to worry about.

32:03.072 --> 32:05.473
Walt, I've got to talk to you.

32:05.574 --> 32:07.008
It's about Billy.

32:12.948 --> 32:17.185
There's nothing I can do
for your son, Bob.

32:17.286 --> 32:19.120
He did a bad thing.

32:19.221 --> 32:22.256
There's gonna be consequences.

32:22.357 --> 32:25.660
Except he didn't.

32:25.761 --> 32:28.830
Billy didn't do
what he said he did.

32:28.931 --> 32:32.200
It was me.

32:32.301 --> 32:34.635
I was driving.

32:34.736 --> 32:37.038
I've been drinking
for a few days,

32:37.139 --> 32:39.140
and Yelena broke up with me,

32:39.241 --> 32:42.176
and... Billy came
to pick me up.

32:42.277 --> 32:45.012
But I made him let <i>me</i> drive.

32:45.114 --> 32:47.782
Trying to prove something
to him, I guess.

32:47.883 --> 32:49.617
Then...

32:53.388 --> 32:55.456
When we hit Cady's car...

32:55.557 --> 32:58.025
He told me to take off.

32:58.127 --> 33:00.027
Said he wasn't as drunk as me.

33:00.129 --> 33:01.362
Because of my record,

33:01.463 --> 33:03.498
I'd probably get
in more trouble.

33:03.599 --> 33:09.003
So you have to
arrest <i>me,</i> Walt...

33:09.104 --> 33:11.139
Not Billy.

33:11.240 --> 33:13.174
I did it.

33:24.186 --> 33:25.920
Get...

33:26.021 --> 33:28.022
Get up!

33:28.123 --> 33:30.992
Come on!

33:31.093 --> 33:35.263
You're coming with me.
Come on.

33:42.999 --> 33:47.036
There it is.
That's the car you hit.

33:47.137 --> 33:51.540
That's the car you were driving
before you walked away.

33:51.641 --> 33:54.076
Get in.

33:54.177 --> 33:57.112
Get in there behind the wheel.

33:57.180 --> 33:59.515
Tell me what happened.

34:13.362 --> 34:15.164
Stop.

34:21.504 --> 34:23.806
You didn't crawl out
of this wreck, Bob.

34:23.907 --> 34:26.141
Your son did.

34:26.242 --> 34:29.445
He was skinny enough and
panicked enough to tear free.

34:29.545 --> 34:31.246
He squeezed his way out.

34:31.348 --> 34:33.248
And this car was heading
<i>towards</i> the Red Pony,

34:33.350 --> 34:34.550
not <i>away</i> from it.

34:34.650 --> 34:36.418
Your son hadn't even
picked you up yet.

34:38.188 --> 34:42.623
Now, tell me, Bob, how'd you
really get those cuts?

34:42.726 --> 34:44.326
These cuts are not
from yesterday.

34:44.427 --> 34:45.594
They're fresh.

34:45.695 --> 34:48.664
You tell me the truth, Bob.

34:48.732 --> 34:51.967
When I found out...

34:52.068 --> 34:54.937
When I found out
you arrested

34:55.005 --> 34:57.806
When you arrested Billy,
I had to do something!

34:57.907 --> 35:00.809
I had to do something!

35:00.910 --> 35:04.747
I mean, this whole damn thing
was my fault!

35:04.814 --> 35:07.082
If I wasn't such
a worthless drunk,

35:07.183 --> 35:10.119
Billy wouldn't have even been
in the same place!

35:10.186 --> 35:12.321
He wouldn't have even
been there!

35:12.389 --> 35:14.857
Oh, God.

35:17.460 --> 35:20.129
And so
I broke a bottle.

35:20.196 --> 35:23.832
I cut myself up because I wanted
to convince you...

35:23.933 --> 35:26.101
that I did this
to your daughter, Walt.

35:26.202 --> 35:27.970
<i>I</i> did it.

35:28.071 --> 35:30.672
I may not have been driving
the damn car,

35:30.740 --> 35:33.442
but I did this!

35:33.543 --> 35:37.346
It was <i>my</i> fault,
and I should be punished!

35:37.447 --> 35:39.048
Not Billy!

35:39.115 --> 35:42.684
Please, God, Walt!

35:46.189 --> 35:48.757
My life is over.

35:52.295 --> 35:55.164
And I have wasted it.

35:57.300 --> 36:01.537
But don't let me ruin
my son's life.

36:03.673 --> 36:06.809
I deserve to be punished,
not Billy.

36:12.348 --> 36:14.650
Do we need to put this
in triplicate?

36:14.751 --> 36:16.418
No.
Just initial it.

36:27.864 --> 36:32.334
A signed confession
Bob Barnes was the driver.

36:32.402 --> 36:34.009
I got a signed confession
from Billy

36:34.129 --> 36:35.398
saying the same thing.

36:35.518 --> 36:38.941
He said/he said.
I believe Bob.

36:39.042 --> 36:42.678
Release him, Ferg.

36:44.447 --> 36:46.048
No.

36:46.116 --> 36:47.816
I won't.

37:04.300 --> 37:06.235
Dad?

37:06.302 --> 37:08.370
What's going on?

37:08.471 --> 37:10.472
Come on.

37:45.742 --> 37:48.577
Branch, there's nothing
in the tread walls.

37:48.678 --> 37:50.245
You sure?

37:50.313 --> 37:52.114
It's practically
brand-new.

37:52.215 --> 37:53.916
I know.

37:54.017 --> 37:55.584
It's crazy.

37:55.685 --> 37:57.085
No nails, screws, nothing.

37:58.588 --> 38:00.022
You want to buy a new tire?

38:00.123 --> 38:01.590
No, I want to fix this one.

38:01.691 --> 38:02.858
Look, maybe...

38:02.959 --> 38:04.927
Maybe the leak's
not in the tread.

38:05.028 --> 38:07.329
Maybe... maybe
it's in the sidewall.

38:07.430 --> 38:09.698
All right.

38:09.799 --> 38:11.200
Hey, come on.

38:11.301 --> 38:13.202
Listen, I got to go ring up
those customers.

38:13.303 --> 38:15.537
I'll be right back.

38:15.605 --> 38:17.773
Yeah, sorry for the wait.

38:17.874 --> 38:19.341
Let me go get that part.

38:47.503 --> 38:49.071
Hey, punk.

38:57.981 --> 39:00.315
I thought if I could...

39:00.416 --> 39:03.252
if I could figure out
who hit you,

39:03.353 --> 39:06.722
I can find who to blame...

39:06.789 --> 39:09.858
that would somehow fix this.

39:12.629 --> 39:16.431
And here you still are.

39:16.532 --> 39:19.434
I haven't fixed anything.

39:24.340 --> 39:28.577
They say this is all
a horrible accident.

39:28.678 --> 39:32.314
This wasn't an accident.

39:34.217 --> 39:37.853
This is because of me.

39:48.965 --> 39:53.535
I found Bob Barnes in here
yesterday morning...

39:53.636 --> 39:55.070
Drunk.

39:55.138 --> 39:57.973
I told him to call someone
to come pick him up.

39:58.074 --> 40:02.044
I-I keep thinking...

40:02.145 --> 40:03.712
What if I had
driven him home myself?

40:03.813 --> 40:05.080
If I had just...

40:05.181 --> 40:07.149
This isn't about
any of that, Henry.

40:07.250 --> 40:10.752
This is <i>our</i> fault.

40:10.820 --> 40:13.255
You don't do what we did
in Denver

40:13.356 --> 40:15.724
without there being
consequences.

40:22.899 --> 40:25.400
I need to make things right.

40:25.468 --> 40:28.904
You cannot confess to a crime
you did not commit.

40:29.005 --> 40:31.440
I'm not talking
about confessing.

40:31.541 --> 40:34.976
I need to set things straight
with the world.

40:35.078 --> 40:37.079
With myself.

40:39.382 --> 40:41.483
With Cady.

40:41.551 --> 40:44.319
I've been selfish.

40:44.420 --> 40:48.190
I have to make a sacrifice.

40:50.093 --> 40:52.194
What are you saying?

40:52.295 --> 40:54.629
I need eagle feathers.

40:57.567 --> 40:59.668
I need your blessing
to do something

40:59.736 --> 41:01.903
a white man is not
supposed to do.

41:04.807 --> 41:07.242
No.

41:10.446 --> 41:13.682
I need to do this, Henry.

41:13.750 --> 41:17.919
There's nothing else I <i>can</i> do.

41:22.458 --> 41:25.894
We are nothing
but flesh and muscle...

41:25.995 --> 41:29.831
bones and blood.

41:29.932 --> 41:32.367
It is all we have to give.

41:44.080 --> 41:45.914
It is good you made
this vision quest

41:46.015 --> 41:49.384
to help your daughter.

41:49.485 --> 41:52.921
You will suffer...

41:53.022 --> 41:56.124
and shed blood
for the one you love.

41:58.127 --> 42:01.163
This is honorable.

42:04.133 --> 42:06.268
Her suffering
will not be in vain

42:06.369 --> 42:09.838
as long as you maintain your
focus on the healing vision.

42:28.124 --> 42:30.625
You will return
to the umbilical connection

42:30.726 --> 42:32.861
to mother earth
with this piercing.

42:32.929 --> 42:34.863
Your communication with Maheyo

42:34.931 --> 42:37.299
will be through the love
of our mother.

42:37.400 --> 42:38.934
This way, your own thoughts

42:39.035 --> 42:41.136
will not cloud
the healing vision.

42:41.204 --> 42:45.273
Your sacrifice
will be made tangible

42:45.374 --> 42:48.443
through the shedding
of your blood and body.

42:48.544 --> 42:51.847
Your silence will be heard.
