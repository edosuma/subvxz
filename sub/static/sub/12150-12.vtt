00:01.929 --> 00:03.819
Previously on Angel:

00:07.929 --> 00:11.300
- For God's sake, help us.
- People are going to die.

00:11.529 --> 00:13.320
I just can't seem to care.

00:14.529 --> 00:16.670
Holland Manners is dead,

00:17.530 --> 00:18.609
Angel....

00:20.000 --> 00:26.074

00:30.730 --> 00:33.189
- What you did is wrong.
- You went too far.

00:33.130 --> 00:37.409
The three of us are all that's standing
between you and real darkness.

00:39.130 --> 00:40.390
You're all fired.

00:48.729 --> 00:52.729
- You think I don't have what it takes.
- I know you don't.

00:54.130 --> 00:56.689
I guess we'll just have to find out.

01:00.130 --> 01:04.310
Go on, English, make your move,
because it'll be your last.

01:13.329 --> 01:16.170
Now I rule Europe, Australia
and South America!

01:16.930 --> 01:18.049
I still got Kamchatka.

01:18.129 --> 01:21.219
Three-fifths of the world is water,
the rest is me.

01:21.730 --> 01:24.849
Who's your ruler, baby?
What's my name? Say it.

01:25.930 --> 01:30.459
Fun as it is having you guys over day
and night, it's getting kind of late.

01:31.329 --> 01:35.790
- It's only 7:30.
- Really? Oh, in that case...get out!

01:37.930 --> 01:39.650
- What if you have a vision?
- I'll call.

01:40.329 --> 01:42.890
- What if Angel--?
- We're not saying the "A" word.

01:43.329 --> 01:46.310
Don't say the "A" word,
but wait for him to call.

01:46.930 --> 01:49.769
We're not waiting for him to call.
He fired us.

01:50.530 --> 01:53.409
We're a separate unit,
fighting the good fight.

01:54.129 --> 01:57.540
Right. With no plan or office
or business cards.

01:58.329 --> 02:00.359
He's never gonna call, is he?

02:02.530 --> 02:06.849
The first thing we're scrapping:
these stupid calling cards.

02:07.329 --> 02:10.490
They are not stupid. I designed them.

02:10.930 --> 02:14.259
- That's an angel.
- The symbol of what we don't have.

02:15.129 --> 02:19.270
That's an angel? Looks like
a lobster with a growth or....

02:20.530 --> 02:24.530
- We'll make our own logo.
- Yes. Something sleek, but edgy.

02:25.930 --> 02:30.139
- That says: "You need us, we're here."
- Exactly. "Danger is our business.

02:30.729 --> 02:33.189
- We'll catch you when you fall."
- I like it.

02:33.770 --> 02:35.000
Guys.

02:36.169 --> 02:40.740
- Easy. Breathe. Breathe.
- What is it? What'd you get?

02:43.370 --> 02:47.939
It has two heads and it breathes fire.
It's gigantic...

02:48.770 --> 02:53.340
...and it's rising up in the sewers
beneath Kenyard School for Girls.

02:54.770 --> 02:55.930
Don't go alone!

03:03.689 --> 03:07.379
- Sorry.
- It's me. I didn't hurt you, did I?

03:09.689 --> 03:12.360
- I'm fine.
- I couldn't see over the box.

03:12.689 --> 03:15.360
I was rushing. I'm late for work.

03:16.889 --> 03:18.050
You do clown work?

03:19.889 --> 03:22.840
No. Just some old clothes
that got donated.

03:23.490 --> 03:25.379
East Hills Teen Center.

03:26.490 --> 03:27.960
It's on the box.

03:28.889 --> 03:30.500
Oh. Right.

03:33.090 --> 03:34.490
You missed one.

03:38.490 --> 03:40.810
Hold on. Sorry.

03:43.289 --> 03:46.129
Okay, I think I'm good.
I'm really sorry.

03:46.889 --> 03:48.889
- No problem.
- They're for the kids.

03:49.289 --> 03:53.219
There's always a feeding frenzy
when a new batch comes in.

03:54.090 --> 03:56.550
- You work with runaways?
- Some of them.

03:57.090 --> 03:59.830
Some are from around here
with nowhere to go.

04:00.689 --> 04:03.919
We give them food, clothes,
somewhere to stay.

04:04.289 --> 04:08.050
That's good that someone's--
Well, it's good to do.

04:11.490 --> 04:14.159
- Well, I'm late.
- Right.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.550
See you around.

05:54.370 --> 05:56.439
- So it's big.
- Big.

05:56.769 --> 05:58.660
- Fire-breathing.
- Breathing.

05:59.170 --> 06:02.290
- Big, two-headed, fire-breathing--
- We have the picture.

06:03.370 --> 06:06.779
He shouldn't be attending
the Kenyard School for Girls.

06:06.970 --> 06:09.500
- I wouldn't mind having--
- Don't say it.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.670
We don't.
It's no good wishing we had him.

06:13.569 --> 06:16.339
- I was gonna say, some dynamite.
- Oh.

06:17.170 --> 06:18.329
Dynamite.

06:19.569 --> 06:21.959
Maybe it's not too late
to go back--

06:33.970 --> 06:34.839
Oh, God.

06:34.569 --> 06:37.730
The tunnel's 20 feet tall.
He was crouching.

06:39.370 --> 06:42.110
We'll take another look,
and then we'll--

06:42.370 --> 06:43.839
Die.

06:47.769 --> 06:51.699
Wait, wait!
Wait till his back is turned.

06:52.569 --> 06:53.439
Now!

06:58.089 --> 07:00.439
I thought she said he breathed fire.

07:07.089 --> 07:08.319
Evening, Merl.

07:08.889 --> 07:12.300
What do you want, man?
I ain't inviting you in.

07:13.689 --> 07:15.439
Demon lairs. No invite needed.

07:16.089 --> 07:18.829
- But it's polite--
- You avoiding me, Merl?

07:19.689 --> 07:23.829
I ask you for a favor, and you're
avoiding me. That's impolite.

07:25.089 --> 07:29.410
Nearly drowning me and leaving me
in a sewer ain't exactly Emily Post.

07:29.889 --> 07:32.980
So we're both rude.
Do you have the information...

07:33.970 --> 07:37.199
...or must I see what the inside
of that head looks like?

07:37.569 --> 07:38.759
Fine!

07:40.569 --> 07:43.899
I checked out the girl. She's clean.

07:44.170 --> 07:46.560
Changed her name twice, but no record.

07:47.170 --> 07:51.139
- Her connection to Wolfram & Hart?
- She runs a shelter on Crenshaw.

07:51.970 --> 07:54.569
Recently, they almost
lost their lease.

07:54.970 --> 07:58.589
Wolfram & Hart step in,
clear it all up pro bono.

07:59.170 --> 08:02.819
- But she's still working for them.
- You know so much, why ask?

08:03.970 --> 08:05.689
Why do you need me?

08:05.769 --> 08:08.720
What happened to that
hot chick working for you?

08:09.970 --> 08:12.600
- Pro bono. It's gotta be an angle.
- Always is.

08:12.970 --> 08:17.540
But as far as I could tell,
the shelter itself is strictly legit.

08:19.569 --> 08:24.139
- Hey, what about my hundred bucks?
- Know what? I'll owe you.

08:24.970 --> 08:27.879
Just make sure you use it
for some new furniture.

08:28.569 --> 08:31.100
Beanbag chairs?

08:33.370 --> 08:34.840
Merl....

08:39.370 --> 08:41.019
What am I supposed to do?

08:41.169 --> 08:45.029
Say no. Benny knows the rules.
He's not coming in here drunk.

08:45.970 --> 08:48.179
Turn him out. Don't listen to him.

08:53.169 --> 08:57.279
- Hey. Guy I ran over.
- Hey. Girl who ran over me.

08:57.970 --> 09:01.549
- You can call me Anne. It's shorter.
- Angel.

09:02.169 --> 09:06.000
- I don't know if they're good--
- That's great.

09:06.970 --> 09:08.649
We can take them over here.

09:09.970 --> 09:12.389
Well, let's see. What do you got?

09:13.570 --> 09:16.200
Well, that's not what I expected.

09:17.169 --> 09:19.870
- Doesn't fit anymore?
- Cuts me across the bust.

09:20.769 --> 09:24.809
A friend left her clothes at my place.
I won't see her anytime soon....

09:25.570 --> 09:27.740
- Ex-girlfriend?
- God, no.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.990
I mean, just "no."

09:32.169 --> 09:36.450
We really appreciate this.
Every little bit helps, you know.

09:37.570 --> 09:42.139
- I just wish I could do more.
- Well, if you're not in a hurry....

09:42.970 --> 09:44.129
You up for a tour?

09:46.570 --> 09:50.009
Here's the vibrant nerve center
of our huge corporation.

09:50.769 --> 09:51.710
Well....

09:52.570 --> 09:54.429
- It's....
- Small.

09:54.970 --> 09:57.639
I know. But I'm hardly ever in here.

09:58.570 --> 10:00.429
You just come in for naps?

10:02.769 --> 10:04.309
Oh, the bed.

10:04.570 --> 10:08.570
Sometimes I'm here so late,
it's just easier than going home.

10:09.370 --> 10:10.950
So, what do you think?

10:12.370 --> 10:13.700
Amazing.

10:15.970 --> 10:19.230
- You say it runs on donations?
- Every last penny.

10:20.169 --> 10:23.259
Gotta be tough.
I mean, trying to stay ahead.

10:24.370 --> 10:27.990
- Thankfully, we have a guardian angel.
- Guardian angel?

10:28.570 --> 10:32.190
Wolfram & Hart, a law firm.
They've been a godsend.

10:32.769 --> 10:36.070
Bailed us out of an eviction.
Defended some of our kids.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.919
- They sound like saints.
- As far as I'm concerned.

10:40.570 --> 10:44.120
- They came up with the Big Holdup.
- Holdup?

10:44.769 --> 10:46.799
It's a fundraiser for the center.

10:47.169 --> 10:51.210
Big TV celebrities pretend to rob
the guests of their donations.

10:51.970 --> 10:56.360
- Wild West theme. It's gonna be big.
- Wolfram & Hart's picking up the tab?

10:57.370 --> 11:00.250
They're donating everything.
Music, food....

11:00.370 --> 11:03.669
- And they know all the TV stars.
- That's not surprising.

11:04.570 --> 11:08.919
It's good for their image, I guess.
And it's a pretty dorky theme.

11:09.970 --> 11:13.659
- But, hey, whatever it takes, right?
- Right.

11:21.730 --> 11:23.899
- Does anybody knock?
- You Merl?

11:26.529 --> 11:28.669
Merl? Merl who?

11:28.929 --> 11:31.320
No, the name's Ed...Silverman.

11:32.529 --> 11:35.340
- You're Angel's lackey.
- No. No, I'm not.

11:36.730 --> 11:40.799
- Independent contractor.
- And what do you do for him?

11:43.929 --> 11:47.019
- Pictures. Ow! I take--
- Pictures.

11:50.529 --> 11:54.740
Surveillance, you know. Dig up dirt,
check people out for him.

11:55.330 --> 11:59.610
Not that he appreciates it.
Who the hell are you, anyway? IRS?

12:00.649 --> 12:03.320
Angel and I have a history.

12:04.850 --> 12:06.669
An unfinished history.

12:07.250 --> 12:11.009
That's nice. What, did you guys
go to college together?

12:12.049 --> 12:15.169
These people you check out,
who are they?

12:15.649 --> 12:18.490
Friends? Enemies?

12:19.850 --> 12:21.740
What does Angel care about?

12:22.250 --> 12:26.669
Last thing he had me do was follow
some chick who did charity work.

12:27.649 --> 12:29.580
Why?

12:30.649 --> 12:33.980
Well, between you and me,
it ain't about the girl.

12:34.250 --> 12:38.460
- It's Wolfram & Hart.
- What's a Wolfram & Hart?

12:39.649 --> 12:41.370
A law firm, technically.

12:41.450 --> 12:44.539
More like Evil, Incorporated.

12:45.049 --> 12:48.980
Lately, he's been gunning for them.
Especially these two lawyers.

12:52.250 --> 12:54.320
Tell me about the lawyers.

13:18.970 --> 13:23.220
Lilah. I just had to drop by and
congratulate you on your promotion.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.710
Co-vice president of Special Projects.

13:29.769 --> 13:30.820
That's super.

13:32.769 --> 13:36.320
You deserve it.
Yeah. That, and so much more.

13:36.970 --> 13:39.779
- Angel--
- You know what the special part is?

13:39.970 --> 13:44.539
To think that maybe, in my small way,
I helped make it happen for you.

13:45.370 --> 13:47.370
Makes me feel all good inside.

13:50.769 --> 13:52.659
Angel, I can assure you...

13:53.169 --> 13:56.679
...now that Lindsey and I are in
a position to affect policy...

13:57.370 --> 13:58.629
...things will change.

13:59.769 --> 14:03.600
Change? Well, yeah,
because I get it now.

14:04.570 --> 14:05.480
"It"?

14:05.769 --> 14:09.029
The game. It's actually fun
when you know the rules.

14:09.970 --> 14:13.519
I mean, when you know
that there aren't any.

14:15.370 --> 14:18.250
You screw with me
and you screw with me...

14:18.970 --> 14:21.289
...and you screw with me.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.500
Now I get to screw with you.

14:24.970 --> 14:26.899
- That's gonna be great.
- Please--

14:27.370 --> 14:28.450
No, no.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.490
The begging, that comes later.

14:37.809 --> 14:41.429
- He was in my car.
- Yet here you are, still alive.

14:42.009 --> 14:44.259
- He was trying to spook you.
- It worked.

14:45.009 --> 14:47.500
Relax. He doesn't kill
humans personally.

14:48.009 --> 14:52.580
- He's not playing by the old rules.
- Mr, McDonald, your 10 is here,

14:53.409 --> 14:57.059
- I don't have a 10:00.
- I'm not gonna tell him that,

15:03.370 --> 15:05.830
- Sorry, but I'm afraid I'm--
- Shut the door.

15:11.769 --> 15:14.789
- Won't you come in, Mr...?
- Call me Boone.

15:15.970 --> 15:19.690
- Are you the better half of this team?
- I like to think so.

15:20.169 --> 15:23.429
We run Special Projects.
Do you have a special project?

15:24.370 --> 15:28.159
More like a grudge.
With a fella named Angel.

15:34.649 --> 15:39.000
I haven't seen Angel
since Juarez in the '20s.

15:40.049 --> 15:44.019
We had a little disagreement
over a señorita,

15:45.450 --> 15:49.169
I called him out.
We fought for 3½ hours.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.610
Obviously, both of you survived.

15:52.049 --> 15:56.440
I'd been working on a three-day drunk
at the time. I wasn't at my peak.

15:57.450 --> 16:01.490
- How did it end?
- The sun came up. I let him go.

16:02.250 --> 16:06.570
- You let him go? Why?
- The sun came up.

16:08.850 --> 16:13.029
It would have been too easy.
You people know anything about honor?

16:14.850 --> 16:18.990
Anyway, life is long
when you're eternal.

16:20.250 --> 16:22.600
Always knew I'd cross his path again.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.139
And behold,
I'm in a karaoke bar downtown...

16:25.649 --> 16:28.669
...when I get wind
of this lizard demon, Merl...

16:29.850 --> 16:33.080
...who sometimes does favors
for the vampire with a soul.

16:33.450 --> 16:36.220
I find Merl, and he tells me...

16:37.049 --> 16:39.860
...that Angel's planning
on bringing you two down.

16:41.850 --> 16:44.409
- Did he mention how?
- Don't know, don't care.

16:44.850 --> 16:47.940
All I do know is,
when Angel comes for you...

16:48.450 --> 16:51.259
...he's gonna find me instead.

16:52.649 --> 16:57.220
I like the "finding you instead" part.
How much do you charge?

16:58.649 --> 17:01.389
This isn't about money.
It's about knowing.

17:01.649 --> 17:05.720
- Knowing what?
- Who's better. Him or me.

17:07.650 --> 17:10.598
If you're talking about murder,
we can't help you.

17:11.250 --> 17:13.809
Would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

17:14.250 --> 17:15.858
- Of course.
- Thank you.

17:22.049 --> 17:23.910
Bring him onboard.

17:24.450 --> 17:27.500
Don't forget the senior partners
want him alive.

17:28.049 --> 17:28.920
So?

17:29.250 --> 17:33.250
What if this guy's as good
as he says and actually kills Angel?

17:34.650 --> 17:38.339
Boo-hoo. Let me wipe away the tears
with my plastic hand.

17:39.450 --> 17:42.400
Napoleon, we're partners.
Your plan explodes...

17:43.049 --> 17:47.230
- ...we both end up in tiny pieces.
- Want Angel in your back seat again?

17:48.450 --> 17:51.359
If he won't play by the
old rules, why should we?

17:53.170 --> 17:55.589
- It's huge.
- We were getting stomped.

17:56.170 --> 17:57.750
I'm thrown into the sewer--

17:57.970 --> 18:01.339
You come back stinking, cursing.
The mouth on this boy.

18:02.170 --> 18:05.680
Gunn hits from behind, yelling,
"Look at us when we kill you!"

18:06.369 --> 18:10.299
- Both its heads turn!
- Wes sinks his ax into head number one.

18:11.170 --> 18:14.789
Gunn stabs him, pulls out
intestines the size of your leg!

18:15.369 --> 18:19.509
- We turned him inside out.
- You weren't scared?

18:21.369 --> 18:22.420
Mother in heaven.

18:22.569 --> 18:25.799
Pants-wetting, ask-God-to-save-you
kind of scared.

18:26.769 --> 18:31.299
- But you did it.
- No. We did it. All of us.

18:32.769 --> 18:34.420
- All of us together.
- To us.

18:35.170 --> 18:36.890
- To us.
- To us.

18:41.170 --> 18:45.380
I did something.
I hope you guys don't mind.

18:46.569 --> 18:50.009
I started looking for an office
for our new agency.

18:50.769 --> 18:53.859
- Our new agency?
- Our new agency.

18:54.369 --> 18:57.599
There's this little place nearby.
It's not much, but--

18:58.569 --> 19:00.670
- Why are we still here?
- Let's go.

19:00.970 --> 19:03.740
- Our new agency.
- "The Wyndam-Pryce Agency."

19:04.569 --> 19:07.619
- The what?
- You don't like it? It's classy.

19:08.170 --> 19:12.140
It's stuffy. "The Chase Agency."
That has the right ring.

19:12.970 --> 19:14.970
- Why?
- Because it's my name.

19:15.369 --> 19:17.900
There's only one player here
with the name...

19:18.369 --> 19:20.650
...that strikes dread
in the demon heart.

19:21.369 --> 19:24.809
Gunn? Oh, yeah, that's so original.

19:25.569 --> 19:27.960
I've got a gun, and my name is Gunn!

19:27.970 --> 19:30.460
- "Wyndam-Pryce" says it all.
- Shut up!

19:55.690 --> 19:59.380
You gotta be kidding me.
I swear I didn't rat on you, Angel.

20:00.490 --> 20:03.579
- I didn't say nothing to the guy.
- Shut up, Merl.

20:08.289 --> 20:11.059
Jeez, does everybody know
where I live?

20:12.089 --> 20:14.789
- Gotta get myself a new lair.
- Merl, Lilah.

20:15.690 --> 20:19.410
Now that we're past the pleasantries...
You do favors for Angel?

20:19.890 --> 20:23.579
- What are those favors?
- I don't go selling out my pals.

20:24.849 --> 20:28.109
- How much you gonna pay?
- I think you'll find our offer...

20:29.049 --> 20:32.839
- ...competitive.
- I would have taken a credit card.

20:35.049 --> 20:36.380
Down, Fluffy. Jeez!

20:41.049 --> 20:44.839
- Lately, I've been following a girl.
- What girl?

21:09.849 --> 21:11.009
Hello?

21:14.650 --> 21:16.160
Is anybody out here?

21:16.450 --> 21:17.430
Anne.

21:20.650 --> 21:23.279
You startled me.
What are you doing here?

21:23.650 --> 21:25.470
I have to talk to you.

21:26.049 --> 21:29.460
Oh, boy. You're not
stalking me, are you?

21:31.450 --> 21:33.130
Actually, I am.

21:33.250 --> 21:34.650
Excuse me?

21:35.650 --> 21:40.220
These are pictures I've taken of you.
Surveillance photos.

21:42.849 --> 21:46.640
I took your wallet when we
accidentally ran into each other.

21:48.250 --> 21:51.369
- It wasn't an accident.
- I'm calling the police.

21:52.450 --> 21:55.500
I won't hurt you.
I couldn't lie to you anymore.

21:56.049 --> 21:59.099
- About being a psycho?
- I've been following you...

21:59.650 --> 22:02.349
- ...but it's not why you think.
- You have a reason?

22:02.650 --> 22:06.579
Wolfram & Hart aren't saints.
They don't care about your shelter.

22:07.450 --> 22:09.589
- You're following me--
- I've checked.

22:10.450 --> 22:13.710
They'll use you for good PR,
offer to host a fundraiser.

22:14.049 --> 22:17.700
Money starts rolling in,
but you're not the one counting it...

22:18.849 --> 22:21.549
...so who knows how much
they're keeping?

22:21.849 --> 22:25.009
Next, they'll give you
a list of necessary expenses.

22:25.450 --> 22:29.490
But what do you know,
after a number of untraceable fees...

22:30.250 --> 22:32.529
...you're left with 5 percent, tops.

22:35.049 --> 22:37.930
You follow me, take my picture,
steal my wallet....

22:38.650 --> 22:42.410
- Why should I believe you?
- Wolfram & Hart aren't what they seem.

22:42.849 --> 22:46.039
They show the world one face,
but it's not the truth.

22:47.049 --> 22:49.859
I can prove it.
Everything they say is a lie.

22:50.650 --> 22:52.900
I guess you have something in common.

22:53.650 --> 22:55.230
- Lindsey.
- Are you all right?

22:56.049 --> 22:58.259
- Fine. I--
- He didn't hurt you, did he?

22:58.450 --> 23:02.000
Had I known he was contacting you,
I'd have come sooner.

23:02.650 --> 23:05.180
I'm just thankful
that I got here in time.

23:06.250 --> 23:09.369
A little over the top.
Work on that look of concern.

23:09.849 --> 23:12.309
- He's dangerous.
- You haven't seen anything yet.

23:12.849 --> 23:14.109
Neither have you.

23:17.650 --> 23:20.950
- It's been a long time.
- I brought some protection.

23:21.849 --> 23:24.759
Boone. Working for Wolfram & Hart.

23:25.450 --> 23:28.470
- I thought you had integrity.
- I do.

23:29.049 --> 23:30.730
Here's fair warning.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.529
- Wait.
- He's getting away.

24:12.250 --> 24:16.359
As long as he's not threatening
my client. Soon, but not here.

24:17.049 --> 24:20.769
Go to the car. I'll meet you there.
He won't be back tonight.

24:22.450 --> 24:25.819
It's okay. Angel's gone.
You're safe.

24:34.410 --> 24:37.109
That guy who beat up Angel,
he wasn't human.

24:38.009 --> 24:40.180
See, there's a different world that--

24:40.410 --> 24:43.569
- I'm not naive.
- Angel's not human. He's a vampire.

24:44.609 --> 24:46.119
He's a sick, deranged--

24:46.410 --> 24:49.640
He says you're gonna steal
most of the funds.

24:50.609 --> 24:53.630
Well, he's lying.
I mean, there are expenses.

24:54.210 --> 24:56.950
You know how it works
with any charity event.

24:57.809 --> 25:00.339
- But we don't steal.
- He says he has proof.

25:02.609 --> 25:05.910
He's lying about that too.
Who are you gonna trust?

25:06.809 --> 25:08.809
A mentally unstable vampire...

25:09.210 --> 25:13.250
...or the people that put the
fundraiser together for your kids?

25:14.009 --> 25:17.910
I'd hate to see them lose out
because you made the wrong choice.

25:19.410 --> 25:21.690
So he doesn't have proof?

25:22.410 --> 25:24.160
He can't have proof.

25:24.210 --> 25:25.609
- He's got proof?
- Maybe.

25:26.009 --> 25:28.359
- She said he had proof.
- It'll be okay.

25:29.009 --> 25:32.730
Sure, we only schemed to steal
$2 million from a teen shelter.

25:33.809 --> 25:37.069
- How did this happen?
- If he's got proof, it's from you.

25:37.410 --> 25:40.319
- Me?
- You talked and it's on tape, probably.

25:41.009 --> 25:43.180
You have the professional death wish.

25:43.410 --> 25:46.250
How do I know you're not
on a kamikaze mission?

25:47.009 --> 25:50.519
I only talk to you in my office,
which is swept for bugs.

25:51.210 --> 25:54.119
- I never discussed stealing in public.
- Until now.

25:55.410 --> 25:58.599
The bastard got us on tape.
What'll he do with it?

25:59.609 --> 26:01.890
He's gonna use it to humiliate us.

26:02.009 --> 26:04.990
He's gonna send it to the news.
National coverage--

26:05.609 --> 26:07.930
- It's not personal enough.
- What, then?

26:08.609 --> 26:10.500
- He's gotta be there.
- What? Why?

26:11.009 --> 26:12.900
To see us swing, that's why.

26:15.210 --> 26:17.740
With the bosses there, watching.

26:22.410 --> 26:25.569
It's me. I want security
at the charity ball doubled...

26:26.009 --> 26:28.009
...and put a vampire detector there.

26:38.170 --> 26:41.079
- I thought you'd show up again.
- You all right?

26:42.369 --> 26:46.369
A monster didn't pound my face,
so I figure I'm better than you.

26:47.170 --> 26:51.349
- What did Lindsey say about me?
- That you were a bad man.

26:52.569 --> 26:53.759
A bad man?

26:54.369 --> 26:58.059
A psychotic vampire who cut off
his hand, harassed his firm...

26:58.569 --> 27:01.759
...and is schizophrenic.
I gave you the short version.

27:02.769 --> 27:04.799
Do you believe that?

27:05.769 --> 27:09.529
You're a vampire for sure.
A human would be in the hospital.

27:10.569 --> 27:12.890
And that doesn't frighten you?

27:15.970 --> 27:18.069
Before, it'd have been a turn-on.

27:18.369 --> 27:21.069
- I thought vampires were the coolest.
- What happened?

27:21.970 --> 27:25.589
- I met one.
- You're not afraid of me.

27:26.170 --> 27:27.990
I've seen worse things since.

27:28.569 --> 27:33.140
Saw a 14-year-old sit in blood after
a rough trick, people just walking by.

27:34.569 --> 27:37.589
Vampires, demons, even lawyers
don't impress me.

27:38.170 --> 27:41.430
Maybe you had good reason
to cut off Lindsey's hand.

27:42.369 --> 27:46.549
I care about the shelter. If an evil
law firm will raise $2 million--

27:47.170 --> 27:50.049
- You'll see only 5 percent.
- I did the math.

27:50.769 --> 27:55.160
Five percent is $100,000. That's more
than we could raise in two years.

27:56.170 --> 27:59.960
And the other 95%? You don't care
where it goes or who it hurts?

28:03.369 --> 28:05.650
- I can't.
- There's blood on that money.

28:05.769 --> 28:09.769
Are you a person who can ignore that?
Have you become that yet?

28:10.569 --> 28:11.970
I don't think you have.

28:13.569 --> 28:16.170
- You don't know what it takes--
- Help me.

28:17.170 --> 28:21.880
Get me into the party. This'll show
a whole new side of Wolfram & Hart.

28:24.369 --> 28:27.670
- Why should I?
- Because in the long run, it's right.

28:28.569 --> 28:30.990
Most of my kids don't have a long run.

28:32.170 --> 28:33.470
No.

28:33.970 --> 28:35.549
I'm saying no.

28:52.289 --> 28:56.859
The world can be dangerous, Especially
for our most vulnerable citizens;

28:57.690 --> 28:58.920
Our children,

29:01.289 --> 29:03.849
Far from home,
with little money or hope...

29:04.289 --> 29:07.549
... too many runaways
find themselves on the streets...

29:08.490 --> 29:11.119
...over their heads
and under society's radar,

29:12.089 --> 29:15.849
But there's a place in L.A.
that can help these troubled kids;

29:16.890 --> 29:19.099
The East Hills Teen Center,

29:22.890 --> 29:27.170
It's a terrific refuge that
we at Wolfram & Hart support 100%,

29:27.690 --> 29:29.650
- Lilah.
- Good evening, sir.

29:30.089 --> 29:34.160
- Things progressing nicely?
- Well, it's a pretty simple formula.

29:35.490 --> 29:39.990
The rich pay to touch the famous.
We film the not-quite-prostitutional act.

29:40.289 --> 29:44.539
It goes into public consciousness as
a good deed, courtesy Wolfram & Hart.

29:46.289 --> 29:50.609
It's really true. Charity gives
you this warm glow, you know?

29:51.690 --> 29:53.230
Anne?

29:53.490 --> 29:57.210
Meet one of my bosses, Nathan Reed.
Mr. Reed, this is Anne.

29:58.289 --> 30:02.819
So this is the young woman whose
dedication brings us together tonight.

30:03.690 --> 30:07.059
I try to help where I can.
Thank you for everything.

30:07.890 --> 30:11.859
I think my job underlines
the "heart" in Wolfram & Hart.

30:12.690 --> 30:14.829
Save some time for interviews.

30:15.089 --> 30:18.740
- You're the public face of the charity.
- What a face it is.

30:19.890 --> 30:23.609
Never underestimate
the power of positive publicity.

30:24.089 --> 30:26.720
- He stays here. We forget anything?
- No, sir.

30:27.690 --> 30:30.920
Every entry point's covered.
We're in radio contact.

30:31.289 --> 30:34.980
If this vampire gets within 100 feet,
Zorn will let us know.

30:35.490 --> 30:37.910
If he senses anything, alert Boone.

30:38.490 --> 30:40.490
Can we really change the world?

30:41.490 --> 30:45.109
At Wolfram & Hart,
we're counting on it,

30:49.890 --> 30:53.539
Holland Manners is gone,
but he's looking down on us tonight.

30:54.089 --> 30:55.599
Don't you feel it?

30:55.890 --> 30:59.650
Holland had a vision of the future
most of us can't imagine.

31:00.690 --> 31:03.250
Let's make it come true together.

31:04.890 --> 31:07.940
Let's get started.
But not with a plea for money.

31:09.089 --> 31:13.130
We're not gonna ask you for money.
We're gonna take it at gunpoint.

31:13.890 --> 31:17.400
Welcome our celebrity bandits
from the show life lessons;

31:18.089 --> 31:22.410
Serena Tate, Holden Raynes,
C.J. McCard and Jordan Johns!

31:29.490 --> 31:32.019
Those are some nice duds there, fella.

31:32.490 --> 31:35.089
Let's see that cash you got stowed.

31:35.490 --> 31:37.589
Hey, cowboy, don't hurt me now.

31:40.289 --> 31:43.769
My daughter from my first marriage
is a huge fan.

31:46.890 --> 31:48.849
All posts report in, Over,

31:49.289 --> 31:50.410
West gate clear,

31:50.490 --> 31:53.789
Serena, I have to know.
Your character being gay...

31:54.690 --> 31:57.990
...is that like all about ratings?
Because I don't get it.

32:05.490 --> 32:07.099
No sign of your friend yet.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.430
Angel.

32:16.890 --> 32:19.839
I feared you wouldn't show.
Ready to finish this?

32:28.450 --> 32:31.190
Thank you, wonderful stars
from life lessons...

32:31.450 --> 32:33.769
...for giving so generously
of your time.

32:35.049 --> 32:38.700
- I'm gonna kill my agent.
- And to all of you, our benefactors...

32:39.250 --> 32:42.230
...let me just say that
we can change the world.

32:42.849 --> 32:47.269
With your support, we can make it
a safer place for all our children.

33:03.250 --> 33:05.640
Stunts? This will take forever.

33:10.450 --> 33:11.750
The makeup's fake.

33:13.450 --> 33:15.799
You think we wouldn't
be ready for you?

33:17.049 --> 33:18.589
Where's the tape?

33:20.049 --> 33:23.069
- Where is it? Where's the tape?
- He doesn't have it.

33:24.250 --> 33:27.160
- You okay? I tried to break the fall.
- I'll be fine.

33:27.250 --> 33:29.599
- What the hell?
- Thanks for getting me in.

33:30.250 --> 33:32.250
This place is like a fortress.

33:32.650 --> 33:35.279
- What's going on?
- They're in it together.

33:36.250 --> 33:39.730
- Me, I'm just here for the show.
- She's got the tape.

33:53.049 --> 33:54.559
Watch it!

33:55.450 --> 33:56.500
Be careful!

33:57.250 --> 33:58.509
Excuse me!

34:01.450 --> 34:03.339
- How do you turn it on?
- Give me!

34:03.849 --> 34:06.660
It's not a toy,
It's for gathering evidence,

34:07.450 --> 34:10.119
- Let go,
- You'll just play with it,

34:12.250 --> 34:16.639
I give you two children, Bill,
and you leave me for a man?

34:18.250 --> 34:20.849
No, don't speak, Don't say anything,

34:21.250 --> 34:23.280
What is there to say?

34:23.650 --> 34:26.699
- Interesting choice.
- I believe the coat rack more.

34:32.050 --> 34:34.300
Mmm, Milk,

34:36.849 --> 34:38.849
Mmm, Milk,

34:39.849 --> 34:41.360
Mmm! Milk!

34:47.050 --> 34:49.650
I don't get it, How am I not working?

34:50.650 --> 34:51.730
What's happening?

34:52.449 --> 34:55.780
Looks to me like you two
were acting like crazy people.

34:56.050 --> 34:57.099
On camera too.

34:59.050 --> 34:59.920
Ouch.

35:03.849 --> 35:06.130
Pryce, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce,

35:06.849 --> 35:09.059
Isn't he dating Virginia Bryce?

35:17.050 --> 35:20.309
- You don't have us on tape, do you?
- I got nothing.

35:20.650 --> 35:24.719
You know how hard it is to record
someone as paranoid as you two?

35:26.650 --> 35:29.909
- This whole thing was a setup.
- You hired Boone.

35:30.849 --> 35:34.150
No, you did.
For a whole lot of money too.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.239
The money!

35:37.449 --> 35:40.010
Look out! Move!

35:40.449 --> 35:41.460
- Look out!
- Move!

35:44.050 --> 35:45.280
Come on!

35:47.650 --> 35:49.159
- Damn!
- What happened?

35:49.449 --> 35:50.960
- He stole the money.
- Who?

35:51.570 --> 35:52.579
The cowboy.

35:57.570 --> 36:00.760
How dare you? I risked everything.
I risked my kids.

36:01.769 --> 36:04.610
- There was no exposé.
- They'd have covered it up.

36:04.769 --> 36:07.510
I wanted to shake them up.
It's a start.

36:08.369 --> 36:10.690
- And the money?
- The money was tainted.

36:11.369 --> 36:13.329
- I don't care about--
- Yes, you do.

36:14.050 --> 36:17.699
That's the difference between us.
You still care.

36:25.690 --> 36:30.260
You embarrassed us all. You lost
$2 million earmarked for this firm.

36:31.090 --> 36:35.019
Worst of all, you violated
company policy by hiring an assassin.

36:36.489 --> 36:39.090
One who was, in fact,
in league with Angel.

36:39.489 --> 36:42.329
- I'm very sorry, sir.
- Sorry isn't acceptable.

36:43.690 --> 36:46.389
Holland Manners
was a brilliant lawyer.

36:47.289 --> 36:49.289
Had a tremendous mind.

36:49.690 --> 36:52.500
But he had a soft spot
for the two of you...

36:53.289 --> 36:55.570
...which I believe
clouded his judgment.

36:55.690 --> 36:58.429
- I won't make that mistake.
- Understood.

36:59.289 --> 37:00.449
My advice to you:

37:01.090 --> 37:03.300
- Start piling up wins. Fast.
- Yes, sir.

37:03.489 --> 37:06.119
How do you expect us to succeed...

37:06.489 --> 37:10.630
...when you handcuff us with these
idiotic rules protecting Angel?

37:17.289 --> 37:19.989
I'm sorry, did you say something?

37:22.090 --> 37:24.300
He's an obstacle to all that we do.

37:25.090 --> 37:27.760
Give me a good reason why
we can't kill him.

37:32.889 --> 37:35.769
Because Angel is a major player.

37:37.690 --> 37:40.289
- In business?
- In the Apocalypse.

37:41.289 --> 37:42.800
Oh, that.

37:43.690 --> 37:46.639
The prophesies say
when the final battle is waged...

37:47.289 --> 37:48.829
- ...he is key.
- Good for him.

37:49.090 --> 37:53.659
Which side he's on is the gray area.
We'll continue making it gray.

37:54.489 --> 37:55.429
Works for me.

37:56.289 --> 37:59.480
Until then, his growing obsession
with the two of you...

37:59.889 --> 38:02.730
...the increasing possibility that,
to scratch that itch...

38:03.489 --> 38:05.449
...he'll go as far as to kill you...

38:07.090 --> 38:09.340
...that could play
in the firm's favor.

38:10.090 --> 38:14.440
It would be a sign that Angel
is on the path to joining our team.

38:15.489 --> 38:18.050
As hard as it is
to lose good attorneys...

38:18.489 --> 38:21.929
...well, the truth is,
you're both expendable.

38:23.889 --> 38:26.309
Angel isn't.

38:48.010 --> 38:50.960
I thought you'd be halfway
to Brazil by now.

38:54.010 --> 38:55.199
No, you didn't.

38:56.409 --> 38:57.639
No, I didn't.

39:07.210 --> 39:08.469
How much it come to?

39:09.010 --> 39:12.559
With jewelry, north of
2.5 million, I'd say.

39:14.409 --> 39:17.849
- That's a lot to lay on the line.
- Yeah.

39:18.610 --> 39:20.400
But I gotta know.

39:39.010 --> 39:43.150
All of it. A little bit more
than 5 percent.

39:48.010 --> 39:51.489
- If Wolfram & Hart find out--
- I can hide it.

39:57.010 --> 39:58.380
What's this?

40:00.010 --> 40:00.880
Blood.

40:09.010 --> 40:10.829
It'll wash.

40:55.210 --> 40:57.099
Thank you, thank you very much,
