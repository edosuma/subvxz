Kev, being molested is not
the same thing as being loved.

44:33.637 --> 44:35.220
[whispers]
Yeah, I know.

44:35.220 --> 44:37.845
I know that being a kid
was tough on you,

44:37.845 --> 44:41.303
but you're loved now.

44:41.303 --> 44:43.512
The girls love you.

44:43.512 --> 44:45.637
And there is a vivacious,

44:45.637 --> 44:47.887
successful
pharmaceutical entrepreneur

44:47.887 --> 44:49.387
that is going to love you

44:49.387 --> 44:52.345
in ways that's gon'
blow your mind.

44:52.345 --> 44:54.178
Is that you?

44:54.178 --> 44:56.178
- Yeah, baby, that's me.

Hi, I'm Frank Gallagher.

45:09.303 --> 45:11.387
We spoke online.

♪ funky bass music ♪

45:14.178 --> 45:15.553
You think she's gonna
want to settle?

45:15.553 --> 45:16.929
The only reason she'd
call a meeting like this

45:16.929 --> 45:19.178
is if she didn't
want to go to court, so...

45:19.178 --> 45:20.720
You won, Debbie.

45:20.720 --> 45:22.553
Patti knows
how this game is played.

45:22.553 --> 45:24.595
Now that we're
closing the deal,

45:24.595 --> 45:26.095
we need
to discuss payment.

45:26.095 --> 45:27.428
Payment?

45:27.428 --> 45:29.220
You thought this was
pro bono?

45:29.220 --> 45:32.345
I guess I didn't
really think about it.

45:32.345 --> 45:34.887
But, I mean, I'm about
to run into some cash, right?

45:34.887 --> 45:36.011
[Patti]
Damn straight.

45:36.011 --> 45:38.261
So a lawyer
would typically cost

45:38.261 --> 45:40.512
between 200 and 400
an hour.

45:40.512 --> 45:41.804
Dollars?

45:41.804 --> 45:43.178
But since I'm not
technically a lawyer,

45:43.178 --> 45:44.428
- I, uh...
- [Debbie] What?

45:44.428 --> 45:46.804
I highly recommend
the online program

45:46.804 --> 45:48.261
at South Side
Community College.

45:48.261 --> 45:49.512
The classes are great.

45:49.512 --> 45:51.387
She passed most of them.

45:51.387 --> 45:52.637
You're not a lawyer.

45:52.637 --> 45:53.387
[Patti]
Don't worry.

45:53.387 --> 45:55.053
Never lost a case.

45:55.053 --> 45:57.011
How many cases
have you done?

45:57.011 --> 45:58.011

Who are they?

46:09.303 --> 46:10.970
My judge advocates general.

46:10.970 --> 46:12.804
What are

46:12.804 --> 46:14.011
Military lawyers.

46:14.011 --> 46:15.595
Like real lawyers?

46:17.136 --> 46:18.303
What's this?

46:18.303 --> 46:19.970
An agreement.

46:19.970 --> 46:22.470
Since Derek listed
the beneficiary

46:22.470 --> 46:27.053
of his death benefit
as his wife and children,

46:27.053 --> 46:31.595
and Franny is technically
one of his three children,

46:31.595 --> 46:33.470
I'm willing to give you
one third of the benefit.

46:33.470 --> 46:35.345
- [Megan] Hey.
- [Patti] See, girl?

46:35.345 --> 46:37.970
In return...

46:39.095 --> 46:40.970
I want full custody
of Franny.

46:40.970 --> 46:42.553

I'll see you in a couple days.

47:04.553 --> 47:06.011
Bye.

47:07.595 --> 47:08.637
That was, uh, my--

47:08.637 --> 47:10.345
It's none of
my business.

47:16.261 --> 47:17.679
What?

47:17.679 --> 47:19.512
Look, not that
I care either way,

47:19.512 --> 47:21.845
but if you gave Carl an STD,
you should tell him.

47:21.845 --> 47:24.470
Why, so he doesn't
give it to you?

47:25.512 --> 47:28.887
No, because he's a good guy
and it's the right thing to do.

47:34.720 --> 47:37.553

gave you strep?

48:11.553 --> 48:13.679
I mean, do we have to figure
this out right now?

48:15.095 --> 48:16.512
Guess not.

48:16.512 --> 48:18.345
Does that mean I can
sleep with Anne?

on the phone with Cami,

52:19.136 --> 52:21.136
and I thought
you needed help.

52:23.303 --> 52:27.261
It's not about me needing help
or not needing help.

52:27.261 --> 52:30.679
It's about my baby liking me
or not liking me, and...

all day.
