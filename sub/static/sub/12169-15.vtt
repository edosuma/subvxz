00:03.647 --> 00:06.366
Let me ask you a question.
Say there’s a runaway train.

00:06.527 --> 00:10.520
It’s hurtling towards ten people
standing in the middle of the tracks.

00:10.687 --> 00:13.076
Only way to save those people
is to flip a switch...

00:13.247 --> 00:16.796
... send the train down another set
of tracks. The only problem is...

00:16.967 --> 00:19.640
... there is a baby
in the middle of those tracks.

00:19.807 --> 00:21.877
Why would anyone leave a baby
in a harm’s way ?

00:22.047 --> 00:24.356
l don’t know. That’s not the point.
It’s a dilemma.

00:24.527 --> 00:26.279
Katie brought it up the other night.

00:26.447 --> 00:30.360
The question is, is it appropriate
to divert the train and kill the one baby...

00:30.527 --> 00:31.642
... to save ten people ?

00:32.807 --> 00:34.877
Wouldn’t the people
see the train and move ?

00:35.087 --> 00:36.315
No, they wouldn’t see it.

00:36.767 --> 00:40.442
- Why not ?
- Look, l don’t know. Say they’re blind.

00:40.647 --> 00:42.080
- All of them ?
- Yes, all of them.

00:42.247 --> 00:44.283
Why don’t you call out
and tell them to move ?

00:44.487 --> 00:47.285
- Because they can’t hear you.
- What, they’re deaf too ?

00:47.807 --> 00:50.162
- How fast is the train ?
- The speed doesn’t matter.

00:50.327 --> 00:54.240
It does. If it’s going slow, you could
outrun it and shove everyone to the side.

00:54.447 --> 00:57.598
- Or better yet, go get the baby.
- For God’s sake, l was trying to--

00:57.767 --> 00:59.564
<i>WEIR [ON RADIO] : Rodney ?
- Yes, go ahead.</i>

00:59.727 --> 01:02.161
<i>major Lorne just dialed in
from m4D-058.</i>

01:02.327 --> 01:04.840
<i>He says he’s got something
you’Il want to see.</i>

01:06.207 --> 01:07.196
Work it out.

01:08.127 --> 01:09.606
<i>We came through the spacegate...</i>

01:09.767 --> 01:13.077
<i>... and noticed satellites in
geosynchronous orbit above the planet.</i>

01:13.247 --> 01:14.726
An advanced civilization.

01:14.887 --> 01:15.956
<i>That’s what we thought.</i>

01:16.167 --> 01:19.000
<i>And we picked up life signs directly
below, so we flew down...</i>

01:19.167 --> 01:22.603
<i>... saw villages separated by a river
and decided to check one of them out.</i>

01:22.767 --> 01:26.396
<i>And as you can see, sergeant,
these people don’t exactly look...</i>

01:26.567 --> 01:28.956
<i>... like they’re ready
to be launching any satellites.</i>

01:29.127 --> 01:31.482
<i>At least not
for the next 500 years or so.</i>

01:31.647 --> 01:33.922
Ancients probably put them up there.

01:34.087 --> 01:35.964
Send a science team to check it out.

01:36.847 --> 01:40.726
<i>Actually, I think Dr. mcKay may want
to come check this one out for himself.</i>

01:41.447 --> 01:42.516
Why ?

01:42.967 --> 01:44.480
<i>Take a look.</i>

02:58.567 --> 03:01.365
How did your face get on that flag ?

03:01.527 --> 03:04.087
Oh, l don’t know.
Here’s the thing, though.

03:04.247 --> 03:06.715
That flag’s similar to the one
l designed in our game.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.082
It’s exactly the one you designed
in our game.

03:09.247 --> 03:11.238
- What game ?
- The game Rodney and l play.

03:11.407 --> 03:13.398
- We didn’t tell you ?
- Been playing a while.

03:13.567 --> 03:16.684
Yeah, off and on in our spare time,
at night, between missions.

03:16.847 --> 03:19.680
- l could’ve sworn we told you about it.
- What game ?

03:20.727 --> 03:21.876
It started a while ago.

03:22.087 --> 03:24.555
<i>McKAY : A few months after we arrived,
we were exploring...</i>

03:24.727 --> 03:27.719
<i>... checking out labs on the east pier,
when we discovered a room.</i>

03:27.887 --> 03:30.082
<i>There were several Ancient consoles
and screens.</i>

03:30.247 --> 03:31.726
<i>It’s quite an impressive layout.</i>

03:31.887 --> 03:35.118
<i>As usual, everything sprang to life
as soon as we entered.</i>

03:40.047 --> 03:42.117
<i>First we thought
it was a geological facility.</i>

03:42.287 --> 03:45.723
<i>There was a screen with a map that we
assumed was off the Lantian mainland.</i>

03:45.887 --> 03:48.242
Yes, l remember you briefing me
about that.

03:48.447 --> 03:51.007
- We did tell you.
- You mentioned nothing about a game.

03:51.207 --> 03:54.165
Because we didn’t know what it was.
Rodney studied more closely.

03:54.327 --> 03:56.602
<i>SHEPPARD : He realized
it wasn’t a geological lab at all.</i>

03:56.767 --> 04:00.282
<i>McKAY : No, it turns out it was,
in fact, a kind of Ancient game room.</i>

04:00.447 --> 04:03.883
<i>The map was a fictional civilization.
It was part of a simulated world.</i>

04:04.087 --> 04:05.361
Sweet.

04:05.527 --> 04:08.405
What you do is, you take
these countries in a database...

04:08.567 --> 04:10.159
... and you assume control of them.

04:10.327 --> 04:12.238
Two societies, separated by a river.

04:12.407 --> 04:14.398
Sheppard took one country.
l took the other.

04:14.607 --> 04:17.041
First thing Rodney did
besides renaming his country...

04:17.207 --> 04:19.163
... was to put his face all over the flag.

04:21.807 --> 04:24.002
l think you need to check
this planet out.

04:35.247 --> 04:37.636
So the ancestors created this game ?

04:37.807 --> 04:39.604
Yes, but this is no ordinary game.

04:39.767 --> 04:42.235
l mean, it is incredibly challenging,
instructional.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.921
The sheer number of options
built into it. Staggering.

04:45.087 --> 04:47.999
- How does one play it ?
- Figure out a way to run your country.

04:48.207 --> 04:50.596
Yeah, you build roads,
you establish laws...

04:50.767 --> 04:53.440
... mould it to your own
specific ideology.

04:54.047 --> 04:55.275
<i>McKAY :
You can control everything.</i>

04:55.447 --> 04:58.644
<i>Proper sanitation systems,
water delivery, transportation.</i>

04:58.807 --> 05:01.002
<i>I mean, every detail
can be manipulated.</i>

05:01.167 --> 05:03.761
<i>I mean, right down
to the women’s hairstyles.</i>

05:09.327 --> 05:10.396
Hello there.

05:10.567 --> 05:13.365
- So how do you win this game ?
- It’s not really about winning.

05:13.527 --> 05:16.644
<i>McKAY : It’s more about whose society
outshines the other’s.</i>

05:16.847 --> 05:20.806
l mean, who creates a better
infrastructure, who’s better at trade.

05:22.087 --> 05:24.999
What ? Hey, don’t start.
l tried to negotiate with you.

05:25.167 --> 05:29.399
Making a list of demands and not giving
anything in return is not negotiating.

05:29.607 --> 05:32.679
- l offered you a crop of beans.
- l don’t need beans. l need lumber.

05:32.847 --> 05:35.600
Right, to build defensive fortifications
for your army...

05:35.767 --> 05:38.486
... which he doubled in size,
by the way. Surprise, surprise.

05:38.647 --> 05:41.207
- l did that after you started cheating.
- l didn’t cheat.

05:41.367 --> 05:44.484
Giving his people too much technology
for their level of development.

05:44.647 --> 05:46.877
l’m not the only one
increasing my army.

05:47.087 --> 05:50.284
l had to do something to protect
the people of Geldar from you.

05:50.447 --> 05:52.915
- Geldar ?
- It’s the name of Rodney’s country.

05:53.087 --> 05:55.237
He named it after a girl
he stalked in college.

05:55.407 --> 05:57.841
l did not stalk her. We dated twice.

05:58.007 --> 05:59.725
Teresa Geldar, a very cute blond.

06:00.487 --> 06:04.082
l used to think her name reminded me
of some kind of mythological land.

06:04.247 --> 06:05.680
The kingdom of Geldar.

06:07.327 --> 06:08.806
What did you call your country ?

06:09.007 --> 06:11.840
Well, l just kept the name
it already had.

06:15.607 --> 06:18.565
- Well, there are the satellites.
- Dozens of them.

06:18.727 --> 06:21.764
Positioned directly above the continent.
Perfect grid.

06:21.927 --> 06:25.317
Ten-by-ten.
l should have a visual on one of them.

06:33.647 --> 06:35.797
Definitely looks Ancient.

06:35.967 --> 06:37.241
And active.

06:37.407 --> 06:39.875
It’s transmitting a tremendous
amount of data.

06:40.367 --> 06:42.483
All right, let’s check it out.

If you say so.

07:17.047 --> 07:20.244
Oh, yeah. That’s something you see
in every medieval village.

07:20.407 --> 07:23.717
Yes, well, the Renaissance obviously
came early to these folks.

07:23.887 --> 07:25.479

07:56.567 --> 07:58.523
- Like what ?
- l don’t know.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.279
NOLA :
Hello.

08:01.007 --> 08:02.679
l am Nola.

08:02.887 --> 08:06.118
Yes, well, this is Lieutenant
Colonel John Sheppard...

08:06.287 --> 08:09.120
... Teyla Emmaga, Ronon Dex,
and l’m McKay.

08:09.687 --> 08:12.201
Dr. Rodney McKay.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.319
The resemblance is uncanny.

08:26.727 --> 08:30.481
- You are the Oracle.
- The Oracle ?

08:40.447 --> 08:42.836
Welcome to Geldar.

08:48.927 --> 08:51.361
NOLA :
Please forgive my nervousness.

08:51.527 --> 08:54.041
l never thought you’d appear to us
in the flesh.

08:54.207 --> 08:56.402
TEYLA : Why do you refer to him
as the Oracle ?

08:58.087 --> 09:00.237
The Oracle is a wise
and omnipotent deity.

09:00.447 --> 09:03.325
- Boy, she’s in for a rude awakening.
NOLA : Thousands of years ago...

09:03.487 --> 09:04.886
... he gave our ancestors life.

09:05.087 --> 09:07.920
He instructed how to build their society,
to live their lives.

09:08.087 --> 09:10.043
His guidance was revered by all.

09:10.207 --> 09:13.643
Then one day, without warning,
the Oracle ceased all communications.

09:13.807 --> 09:14.842
War with the Wraith.

09:15.007 --> 09:18.522
Our people were puzzled, but they
continued to adhere to his instructions...

09:18.687 --> 09:21.076
... living their lives according
to his teachings...

09:21.247 --> 09:23.807
... which they passed down
from generation to generation.

09:23.967 --> 09:26.959
Have you not had any trouble
with the Wraith ?

09:27.127 --> 09:29.243
Yes, they’ve come periodically...

09:30.007 --> 09:32.043
... culled our people,
destroyed our villages.

09:32.207 --> 09:33.560
Those who survived rebuilt...

09:33.727 --> 09:37.163
... but only to the level at which
the Oracle had instructed before he left.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.522
We found ourselves stalled
in our development...

09:39.687 --> 09:42.406
... unwilling to push forward
without the Oracle’s guidance.

09:42.567 --> 09:44.285
Hoping one day he would return to us.

09:44.487 --> 09:46.079
And two years ago, he did.

09:46.847 --> 09:50.203
The Oracle resumed communicating
with us, teaching us many new things.

09:50.367 --> 09:53.279
He challenged us to think,
to push the limit of our endeavors.

09:53.447 --> 09:56.325
He changed the name of our country,
and revealed his likeness.

09:56.487 --> 09:58.762
Enough with the pictures.

09:58.967 --> 10:00.320
McKAY :
Ah.

10:00.607 --> 10:03.565
And you communicate through that.

10:03.727 --> 10:05.797
NOLA :
The portal ? Yes.

10:08.807 --> 10:11.116
NOLA : It’s through this that we receive
our instructions.

10:11.287 --> 10:13.403
TEYLA : The Oracle knows
when you’ve carried them out ?

10:13.567 --> 10:15.364
NOLA : Yes.
- It’s the satellites.

10:15.527 --> 10:17.165
They must be tracking everything...

10:17.327 --> 10:20.160
... then relaying it via subspace
back to Atlantis. Remarkable.

10:20.367 --> 10:21.959
So not a game, after all.

10:22.167 --> 10:24.886
No, it’s obviously
some kind of Ancient experiment.

10:25.047 --> 10:28.676
Social development. Try out different
ways to create civilizations.

10:29.367 --> 10:32.120
- This country here.
- Hallona.

10:33.887 --> 10:35.479
A persistent thorn in our side.

10:37.327 --> 10:40.319
Now that you’ve come to us,
you can help us remove it.

10:47.487 --> 10:48.636
WEIR :
So this is it.

10:48.847 --> 10:51.964
Yes, yes. It is an amazing
piece of technology.

10:52.127 --> 10:55.324
It appears to be a sociological
experiment designed by the Ancients...

10:55.487 --> 10:59.036
... to help them as they were seeding
civilizations throughout Pegasus.

10:59.207 --> 11:00.879
l’ve had a chance to look at it.

11:01.047 --> 11:03.800
There are many more civilizations
in the game’s database.

11:03.967 --> 11:07.004
Really ? l thought Rodney
said there were only the two.

11:07.207 --> 11:10.756
That’s what he thought. The countries
that he and Colonel Sheppard...

11:10.927 --> 11:13.157
... are controlling
are on this specific planet...

11:13.327 --> 11:17.559
... but l’ve been able to access the codes
to unlock additional levels to the game.

11:18.127 --> 11:20.516
l mean, to the experiment.

11:20.687 --> 11:24.316
l discovered countries on planets
throughout the galaxy.

11:24.807 --> 11:26.718
Some have been idle for 10,000 years.

11:26.887 --> 11:29.162
They’re waiting instructions
from the Ancients...

11:29.367 --> 11:33.485
... but some have managed to develop
on their own, even flourish.

11:33.647 --> 11:35.797
Some have been destroyed by war...

11:35.967 --> 11:38.481
... and others have been
completely wiped out.

11:40.087 --> 11:44.524
Not that Rodney’s and Colonel
Sheppard’s societies are on this path.

11:47.727 --> 11:50.924
So much power at one’s fingertips.

11:51.847 --> 11:55.476
It’s amazing,
the attraction of this game.

12:01.447 --> 12:04.644
We’ve managed to achieve propulsion
through hand-powered propellers...

12:04.807 --> 12:07.844
... but now, we’re undertaking tests
of steam-powered propulsion.

12:08.007 --> 12:11.283
Only this morning, l completed
a test that proved quite promising.

12:11.447 --> 12:13.722
Really ? That’s great.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.764
- You’re pleased ?
- Yes.

12:15.927 --> 12:18.760
Yes. l mean, this is--
This is quite an achievement.

12:24.367 --> 12:25.356
What’s he doing here ?

12:26.447 --> 12:27.800
It wasn’t my idea.

12:28.487 --> 12:30.478
Dr. Rodney McKay...

12:30.687 --> 12:32.200
... meet Baden.

12:32.407 --> 12:34.716
Oh, your guy.

12:34.887 --> 12:37.481
- My guy.
- Yeah, it figures.

12:37.687 --> 12:39.598
l should have you arrested
for trespassing.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.687
- Go ahead and try.
SHEPPARD : Easy now.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.879
l brought him here because we need
to have a little discussion.

12:46.047 --> 12:47.366
l have nothing to say to him.

12:48.287 --> 12:50.039
- Fine with me.
- Yeah, maybe not.

12:51.167 --> 12:54.000
But we definitely have something
to say to you.

12:55.287 --> 12:58.643
So his story is pretty much
the same as Nola’s.

12:58.807 --> 13:02.083
His ancestors received instructions
from their oracle...

13:02.247 --> 13:04.238
... who disappeared
for thousands of years...

13:04.407 --> 13:07.683
... only to suddenly resume
communicating a few years ago.

13:07.887 --> 13:10.560
McKAY : Let me guess. He told you
to double the size of your army.

13:10.767 --> 13:13.520
Yes, he has a capable army
and some nice villages.

13:13.727 --> 13:16.605
No people riding bicycles,
or hot-air balloons...

13:16.767 --> 13:19.156
- ... because we weren’t cheating.
- l didn’t cheat.

13:19.327 --> 13:21.124
Have you come to agree
to our proposals ?

13:21.287 --> 13:22.561
BADEN :
You mean demands ?

13:23.607 --> 13:24.722
Never.

13:26.247 --> 13:30.001
- Then l refuse to sit at the same table--
- Look, look. Please, just sit.

13:32.887 --> 13:34.286
Thank you.

13:35.767 --> 13:38.076
This hostility between you.

13:38.247 --> 13:41.876
Have your people lived like this
for thousands of years ?

13:42.087 --> 13:44.999
No. There was once peace
between our lands.

13:47.447 --> 13:48.436
Oh, no.

13:48.607 --> 13:53.556
So this hostility,
did it start a few years ago ?

13:53.767 --> 13:57.760
Yes, shortly after the Oracle
resumed communicating with us.

14:05.287 --> 14:07.005
So they’re starving ?

14:07.167 --> 14:10.796
Well, not as of yet. If they don’t change
their approach to agriculture...

14:10.967 --> 14:13.242
... it won’t be long
before their people go hungry.

14:13.447 --> 14:16.245
The frustrating thing is,
there is a piece of fertile soil...

14:16.407 --> 14:20.764
... in the south of the country that would
be ideal for tuber cultivation, you know ?

14:21.567 --> 14:23.922
- l’m sorry, tuber ?
- Tuber, yeah. Tuber.

14:24.087 --> 14:26.476
It is indigenous to the planet.

14:26.647 --> 14:28.603
It’s like a potato.

14:29.527 --> 14:31.358
So why didn’t you say potato ?

14:31.527 --> 14:34.724
Because it’s not a potato, it’s larger.

14:34.887 --> 14:38.516
It has the same texture
and nutrients as a potato...

14:38.727 --> 14:40.524
... but it’s like a cantaloupe.

14:42.167 --> 14:45.398
- That’s a pretty big potato.
- It is a big potato.

14:45.567 --> 14:49.037
- If they plant this thing there, it’Il grow ?
- Yeah, whole fields of it.

14:49.207 --> 14:52.040
l mean, they could sustain
an entire village...

14:52.207 --> 14:54.004
... but they are oblivious to it.

14:55.047 --> 14:58.039
Well, tell them. Anonymously.

14:58.447 --> 14:59.436
Oh, come on, doc.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.962
You can either stand here
and let the people die...

15:02.127 --> 15:04.482
... or you can help them out.

15:04.647 --> 15:06.763
Sounds like a no-brainer to me.

15:10.487 --> 15:14.446
As soon as we input the instructions
into our console, they are relayed back...

15:14.607 --> 15:17.963
... to this device by a number
of satellites in orbit over your planet.

15:18.127 --> 15:21.244
Once you’ve carried out the instructions,
the satellites transmit...

15:21.407 --> 15:24.365
... the real-time results
back to us on our home world.

15:26.407 --> 15:29.001
So you’re saying this is a game ?

15:30.327 --> 15:34.036
No. No. l mean,
we thought it was a game, but--

15:34.247 --> 15:37.523
We didn’t know there were real people
on the other end.

15:38.767 --> 15:40.405
You are the Oracle ?

15:40.567 --> 15:42.922
l’m your Oracle, yes.

15:43.327 --> 15:46.046
- That doesn’t sound right.
- This is difficult to absorb...

15:46.207 --> 15:48.846
- ... but it is all true.
DEX : You flew in the Puddle Jumper.

15:49.007 --> 15:52.238
- You know they have the technology.
- l’m not listening to this.

15:52.407 --> 15:54.318
Just hold on here.
We can prove it to you.

15:54.527 --> 15:55.562
BADEN :
How ?

15:56.367 --> 15:58.085
Let’s go for a ride.

16:14.487 --> 16:17.320
Baden. Nola. This is Dr. Weir,
the leader of our expedition.

16:17.967 --> 16:19.639
Welcome to Atlantis.

16:19.807 --> 16:23.197
If these two gentlemen haven’t done
so already, let me please offer you...

16:23.367 --> 16:26.803
... our sincerest apologies
for this intrusion into your lives.

16:27.007 --> 16:28.804
- Intrusion ?
- Imposition, maybe.

16:28.967 --> 16:30.286
And a benevolent one at that.

16:30.487 --> 16:33.206
If you could see the villages
compared to when we started--

16:33.407 --> 16:34.760
WEIR :
Rodney.

16:35.287 --> 16:37.517
Now, why don’t you take them
to your game room ?

16:37.687 --> 16:39.598
Show them what you two
have been up to.

16:39.767 --> 16:41.041
Right.

16:41.927 --> 16:42.996
Shall we ?

16:48.927 --> 16:53.398
So this is Geldar and this is Hallona.
Look, two weeks ago...

16:53.567 --> 16:55.683
... l instructed you
to start digging a well...

16:55.847 --> 16:59.317
... for the new settlement
on the eastern slope, and look here.

16:59.487 --> 17:01.364
There. See ?

17:04.487 --> 17:06.522
Construction’s already begun.

17:07.127 --> 17:08.640
Yes.

17:09.406 --> 17:10.839
l gave the order myself.

17:14.207 --> 17:15.606
Our lives are just a game.

17:15.807 --> 17:21.483
Well, now, no. They’re not games
to you, and in our defense...

17:21.646 --> 17:23.478
... we were trying to improve your lives.

17:23.646 --> 17:26.002
Everything we did,
every instruction we gave...

17:26.166 --> 17:28.157
... was to better conditions
for your people.

17:28.367 --> 17:31.439
- Even if that meant cheating.
- Okay, enough with that already.

17:36.327 --> 17:38.158
McKAY : Is the room okay ?
NOLA : It’s fine.

17:39.287 --> 17:43.405
Well, then, if you need anything at all,
don’t hesitate to ask, okay ?

17:44.527 --> 17:47.360
You hungry ? Because we could walk
across to the mess hall.

17:47.527 --> 17:50.325
They’ve got, l think,
it’s Salisbury steak today.

17:50.527 --> 17:55.078
It’s very good. They have a gravy
that they put on the steak part...

17:55.287 --> 17:57.960
The Oracle was a god to us.

17:59.847 --> 18:02.486
l believed in his teachings.

18:02.647 --> 18:05.036
So much so that my people
elected me leader...

18:05.207 --> 18:07.675
... because of my passion
for scientific advancement.

18:07.887 --> 18:10.003
Well, they obviously made
the right choice.

18:10.207 --> 18:13.279
Now l must resolve myself
to the fact...

18:13.807 --> 18:16.241
... that the Oracle is only a man.

18:17.167 --> 18:18.486
Yeah.

18:19.007 --> 18:20.645
Sorry about that.

18:21.167 --> 18:24.443
It’s like l said, though, l did what l did
with the best of intentions.

18:24.607 --> 18:25.881
To win a game.

18:26.087 --> 18:31.002
No. No, no. It is not about
winning or losing.

18:31.167 --> 18:34.398
The information l gave you
and your people is very real, very useful.

18:34.807 --> 18:36.035
l’ve set you on a course...

18:36.207 --> 18:39.244
... that will allow you to develop
into a modern society.

18:39.407 --> 18:41.796
Where were you two years ago ?
You were a primitive...

18:41.967 --> 18:44.527
... disparate cluster
of villages stalled in development.

18:44.727 --> 18:46.240
Now you’re making dirigibles.

18:46.447 --> 18:48.563
Do you have any idea
how momentous that is ?

18:51.087 --> 18:53.237
The Oracle once said :

18:53.407 --> 18:57.480
« Ask not what Geldar can do for you,
but what you can do for Geldar. »

18:58.727 --> 18:59.796
Those were your words.

18:59.967 --> 19:02.117
Um-- Give or take.

19:02.287 --> 19:03.879
They are very wise.

19:04.567 --> 19:06.000
Yes.

19:06.807 --> 19:08.320
Yes, they are.

19:09.167 --> 19:13.080
SHEPPARD : Now that you know the truth,
you can go back to living your own lives.

19:13.287 --> 19:15.243
We won’t bother you anymore.

19:15.407 --> 19:18.205
No. You must still help us.

19:18.727 --> 19:21.002
You don’t need our help.
You’Il be fine.

19:21.207 --> 19:22.242
We need more weapons.

19:23.647 --> 19:25.763
The flying machine
you brought us here in.

19:26.647 --> 19:28.763
You called it a Puddle Jumper.

19:28.927 --> 19:30.201
Our army could use it.

19:30.687 --> 19:32.803
No. We can’t do that.

19:33.407 --> 19:36.160
But you encouraged me
to increase the military.

19:36.367 --> 19:41.202
In response to McKay, the other oracle,
doing things that l thought were--

19:41.367 --> 19:46.805
Aggressive ? Arrogant ?
Demeaning to me and my people ?

19:46.967 --> 19:50.516
l will give you arrogant
and demeaning, but--

19:50.727 --> 19:53.639
The people of Geldar have started
digging beneath our borders...

19:53.807 --> 19:56.605
... to exploit coal resources on our land.

19:57.287 --> 19:58.276
Really ?

19:59.007 --> 20:01.157
It was only confirmed yesterday.

20:01.327 --> 20:04.842
This, after several diplomatic attempts
to reach a compromise.

20:05.007 --> 20:06.838
Yeah, we couldn’t come
to an agreement...

20:07.007 --> 20:09.726
... but l didn’t think
he would start digging.

20:10.167 --> 20:13.876
l’m curious to know what response
you would have to such an incursion.

20:15.047 --> 20:19.006
l believe your next command would
be to launch an attack on the mine.

20:19.167 --> 20:21.886
Prevent them from digging further.

20:23.727 --> 20:25.126
l’m right, aren’t l ?

20:30.087 --> 20:31.122
WEIR :
Did they believe you ?

20:31.287 --> 20:34.245
Yes, they are fully aware
of the situation. Not too thrilled.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.967
- We’ve got a big problem, though.
- What is it ?

20:37.127 --> 20:39.083
Game or no game,
we’ve started something...

20:39.247 --> 20:40.805
... these people don’t wanna stop.

20:40.967 --> 20:45.722
They hate each other
and may be headed for a very real war.

20:46.047 --> 20:47.560
Great.

20:48.007 --> 20:53.035
Great. And this is thanks
to your benevolent imposition.

20:59.207 --> 21:02.995
WEIR : l’ve asked you here this morning
so we could have a face-to-face talk.

21:03.167 --> 21:06.204
Now, hopefully,
l can help you reach an understanding.

21:06.367 --> 21:07.595
Where’s Dr. McKay ?

21:07.767 --> 21:10.600
l’ve asked that neither he
nor Colonel Sheppard participate.

21:10.767 --> 21:12.246
l think they’ve done enough...

21:12.407 --> 21:15.240
... in fostering the current tension
between you.

21:15.407 --> 21:18.365
l’ve had some experience
brokering peace treaties.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.882
l’m sure we can find
some common ground.

21:25.487 --> 21:29.605
Okay, why don’t we start
by going back a few years...

21:29.807 --> 21:33.322
... to the time when your two peoples
lived in peace ?

21:33.487 --> 21:34.966
We were naive back then.

21:35.487 --> 21:37.079
Ignorant to our potential.

21:37.847 --> 21:40.964
Once we began
to challenge ourselves intellectually...

21:41.127 --> 21:43.243
... we began to see
how the people of Hallona...

21:43.447 --> 21:46.405
... had been abusing thousands of years
of kindness from us.

21:46.607 --> 21:49.360
l’ve done everything l could
to achieve peace with you.

21:49.567 --> 21:51.319
Really ? Such as ?

21:51.527 --> 21:53.199
l send gifts of goodwill.

21:53.767 --> 21:56.201
You sent crates of citrus fruit.

21:56.687 --> 21:59.838
Citrus. Do you have any idea
what an insult that is to my people ?

22:00.047 --> 22:03.357
- It didn’t used to be.
- l think l know where that comes from.

22:03.567 --> 22:08.687
Did the Oracle tell you
that citrus fruit was bad ?

22:09.447 --> 22:11.802
He made us aware
of its toxic properties, yes.

22:12.007 --> 22:15.886
Everything is toxic to you.
When they’re not busy insulting us...

22:16.047 --> 22:20.006
... they’re complaining about
contaminated food, improper hygiene.

22:20.207 --> 22:22.482
Even the sunlight
is dangerous to them.

22:22.647 --> 22:24.763
The only insult has been
your unwillingness...

22:24.927 --> 22:27.316
... to compromise
in any trade negotiation.

22:27.487 --> 22:30.001
Instead, you choose to increase
the size of your army.

22:30.207 --> 22:32.357
BADEN :
You built an army too.

22:32.567 --> 22:35.035
- Only in response to your aggression.
BADEN : My aggression ?

22:35.247 --> 22:38.398
You dig a mine beneath our border
to steal our coal...

22:38.607 --> 22:40.325
... and you talk about aggression ?

22:40.527 --> 22:43.325
- We’re not stealing your coal.
- You crossed into our land.

22:43.527 --> 22:46.917
What do you need it for anyway ? It’s
not like you know what to do with it.

22:47.087 --> 22:50.124
- You see how she insults us ?
- By stating a fact.

22:50.287 --> 22:53.199
Okay, please,
if we could discuss this reasonably...

22:53.367 --> 22:55.358
... l’m sure we can come
to some sort of--

22:55.527 --> 22:56.676
We’ve tried.

22:57.127 --> 22:59.436
They agree to nothing.

22:59.647 --> 23:02.115
And until Dr. McKay
is brought into this discussion...

23:02.287 --> 23:04.243
... l have nothing further to say.

23:17.487 --> 23:19.159
That went well.

23:19.367 --> 23:22.518
Talk to them. Get them back to the table
and hammer out a truce.

23:22.687 --> 23:24.086
l’ve run into a roadblock.

23:24.247 --> 23:26.522
- Really ? Nola seemed very agreeable.
- To you.

23:26.687 --> 23:28.962
Well, more agreeable
than Richard the Lion-Heart.

23:29.127 --> 23:32.437
They are both refusing to compromise.
You seem to have convinced them...

23:32.607 --> 23:34.916
... they can’t make decisions
without your guidance.

23:35.087 --> 23:37.442
- That’s not true.
- Tell them that.

23:39.087 --> 23:40.679
NOLA :
This is delicious.

23:40.887 --> 23:43.685
Listen, you need to make peace
with the people of Hallona.

23:43.887 --> 23:46.447
If tensions keep rising like this,
it could lead to war.

23:46.607 --> 23:47.596
l’m aware of that.

23:47.807 --> 23:50.162
Then you’re also aware
that people will get hurt.

23:50.327 --> 23:54.002
l know the danger to my people.
l also know you’ve taught us things...

23:54.207 --> 23:57.563
... Baden’s band of knuckle-draggers
won’t learn for hundreds of years.

23:58.087 --> 23:59.202
Under your leadership...

23:59.367 --> 24:02.040
... we hope to remain many steps
ahead of any aggression.

24:02.207 --> 24:04.721
Your people need
to start thinking for yourselves.

24:04.927 --> 24:07.361
Look, l’m not going to be there
for you anymore.

24:07.527 --> 24:10.678
You need to take control of your lives.
Make your own decisions.

24:10.847 --> 24:13.077
And there can be no future
without peace.

24:13.287 --> 24:14.720
- l agree.
- Good.

24:16.287 --> 24:20.166
And as soon as the people of Hallona
either concede or get out of our way...

24:20.327 --> 24:21.680
... peace will be restored.

24:23.047 --> 24:24.275
What you told me before.

24:24.967 --> 24:28.357
l do realize how monumental
our progress has been...

24:28.927 --> 24:31.680
... and l refuse
to let Baden destroy that.

24:31.887 --> 24:36.005
« Great spirits have always encountered
opposition from mediocre minds. »

24:36.207 --> 24:39.119
Those are the words of the Oracle.
Your words.

24:39.327 --> 24:40.760
Einstein’s, actually, but--

24:40.927 --> 24:43.885
If we yield one bit to Hallona...

24:44.087 --> 24:48.603
... it will be equal to taking
a giant step back in our development.

24:49.447 --> 24:52.644
l owe it to my people to make sure
that does not happen.

24:52.847 --> 24:54.075
Hm.

24:56.167 --> 24:57.486
[BEEPING ]

24:57.647 --> 24:59.683
BADEN :
They’re digging further.

24:59.887 --> 25:02.355
Every hour,
they intrude deeper into our land.

25:02.527 --> 25:05.405
To get them to stop,
you have to provide an incentive.

25:05.567 --> 25:07.239
Like attacking the mine ?

25:07.407 --> 25:09.523
That’Il cause a whole other
set of problems.

25:09.687 --> 25:12.076
The only problems will be
for the people of Geldar.

25:12.247 --> 25:14.317
Not necessarily. They can fight back.

25:14.487 --> 25:16.637
What are you saying ?
We should capitulate ?

25:16.807 --> 25:20.402
- Let them do whatever they want ?
- No, you make a deal, trade.

25:20.567 --> 25:22.797
Say you decide to share
some of your weaponry.

25:22.967 --> 25:25.242
They, in turn,
give you some of their technology.

25:25.407 --> 25:26.760
<i>WEIR [ON RADIO] :
John ?</i>

25:27.607 --> 25:29.996
<i>- Go ahead.
-How’s it going ?</i>

25:30.167 --> 25:33.637

37:58.047 --> 38:01.323

38:05.247 --> 38:08.045
- Nola’s army has surrounded the village.

They just destroyed it.

38:17.407 --> 38:19.159
We’re being overwhelmed.

38:43.807 --> 38:45.286
Game over.

<i>SHEPPARD :
Rodney, are you there ?</i>

38:51.687 --> 38:55.600
Yeah, we hear you. l’Il give you a call
when we’re ready to be picked up.

38:55.767 --> 38:57.200
<i>Got it.</i>

38:57.607 --> 38:59.484
l don’t understand.

39:00.127 --> 39:01.242
What’s going on ?

39:02.687 --> 39:06.043
What you just witnessed is what
l would call another level to the game.

39:06.207 --> 39:08.198
See, we were beamed up earlier
to our ship.

39:08.367 --> 39:10.597
<i>The Daedalus, in orbit over your planet.</i>

39:10.767 --> 39:13.679
While we were there, l had Dr. McKay
hack into the two devices.

Upload doomsday scenarios
for your countries into the game.

39:17.007 --> 39:20.477
<i>Everything you saw just now
was transmitted from the Daedalus.</i>

39:21.727 --> 39:23.399
You mean...

39:24.087 --> 39:25.645
... none of this was real ?

39:26.527 --> 39:28.836
No. No one was hurt.
No one was killed.

39:29.527 --> 39:31.483
All just part of the simulation.

39:31.647 --> 39:35.242
In reality your two armies are standing
down, awaiting further instructions.

39:36.047 --> 39:38.242
But we heard explosions. We felt them.

39:38.447 --> 39:43.282
<i>Thanks to some pinpoint shots
from our friends in the Daedalus.</i>

39:43.807 --> 39:45.718
Really added to the realism, didn’t it ?

39:49.567 --> 39:51.558
l’m sorry that we had to do that...

39:52.247 --> 39:55.000
... but you needed to see
how this could end.

39:55.567 --> 39:57.956
Feel what a real war is like.

40:07.367 --> 40:10.564
You still think it was the right path
for your people ?

40:20.247 --> 40:22.044
Thanks, Melanie.

How’s it going ?

40:28.167 --> 40:30.078
It’s still going.

40:30.487 --> 40:31.966
We’re just taking a break.

40:32.127 --> 40:34.277
There’s a lot of animosity
to be unraveled...

40:34.447 --> 40:37.644
... but l think they are finally willing
to try to make it work.

40:37.807 --> 40:39.399
It’s about time.

40:39.567 --> 40:41.080
Yeah. And you two ?

40:42.407 --> 40:43.635
Called a truce yet ?

40:44.047 --> 40:45.605
Yeah, sure, we’re good.

40:45.807 --> 40:47.763
We’re gonna stick to chess
from now on.

40:47.967 --> 40:50.925
- As long as Rodney doesn’t cheat.
- Please, like l need to cheat.

Okay, l’Il leave you to it then.

- What ? Oh, no. What happened there ?
- What happened is l kicked your ass.

41:04.567 --> 41:07.400
No, no, l was distracted.
She was-- Okay, we’re going again.
