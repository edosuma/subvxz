00:53.820 --> 00:54.855
Help.

00:56.523 --> 00:58.093
Help me!

01:31.858 --> 01:33.633
Help me, Lord.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.529
I'm dying.

01:36.162 --> 01:37.732
What is this?

01:39.165 --> 01:40.337
Cancer?

01:53.980 --> 01:56.517
Mother Mary, full of grace, protect me

01:56.583 --> 01:58.563
and guide me in my hour of death.

03:01.648 --> 03:03.127
It's a test.

03:08.254 --> 03:09.562
Cut it down.

03:10.957 --> 03:12.300
Cut it down.

03:55.935 --> 03:57.209
Shh.

04:41.314 --> 04:43.988
Sue Snell
and Tommy Ross, come on.

04:54.027 --> 04:57.873
Let's go, ladies!
In the water! Caps on, please!

04:58.598 --> 05:00.805
Chris and Sue, let's go!

05:19.419 --> 05:23.595
I want you to keep it
in the air three times. All right?

05:27.860 --> 05:30.431
We are graduating,
Ms. Desjardin.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.903
Yeah, Sue!

05:34.200 --> 05:35.543
Get that.

05:37.236 --> 05:40.080
Don't be afraid of the ball, ladies.

05:40.139 --> 05:41.948
All right, here we go.

05:52.452 --> 05:55.126
All right, Carrie White.
Let's get Carrie into the game.

05:55.455 --> 05:57.901
You can't stand
on the sidelines all the time. Come on.

05:58.558 --> 06:00.003
Whoo!

06:00.626 --> 06:01.764
Carrie's serve.

06:01.828 --> 06:02.898
Yeah, Carrie White!

06:03.463 --> 06:05.101
Do it, Carrie! Yeah, yeah.

06:05.732 --> 06:07.803
Throw it. Do it. Serve it.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.310
Oh. Ow.

06:16.609 --> 06:18.145
What the hell?

06:19.412 --> 06:21.085
It's so funny, Chris.

06:21.647 --> 06:23.320
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

06:25.251 --> 06:26.662
Oh, my God.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.090
You eat shit.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.712
- No, he didn't.
- Yes, he did.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.076
No, he didn't. You're making it up.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.616
He came up to me and I said,
"Well, you have to extend your hand..."

06:45.671 --> 06:47.116
Now you're lying.

08:07.887 --> 08:10.595
Help! Help! Help me!

08:12.291 --> 08:13.531
Help me.

08:13.759 --> 08:15.796
- Get off me, you freak!
- Please.

08:15.962 --> 08:17.964
Oh, my God.
Look what you did to my shirt.

08:18.130 --> 08:19.131
Please!

08:19.198 --> 08:20.905
Stop! Stop! Settle down.

08:22.034 --> 08:24.310
I think I'm bleeding to death. Please.

08:24.470 --> 08:26.211
Oh, my God.
It's period blood.

08:26.272 --> 08:27.546
I'm bleeding. I think I'm dying.

08:27.607 --> 08:29.609
What? Oh, my God.

08:29.909 --> 08:31.616
Please help me!

08:31.777 --> 08:33.484
It's just your period.

08:36.048 --> 08:37.424
Just plug it up.

08:37.783 --> 08:39.490
- Help me!
- Oh, God!

08:39.652 --> 08:41.825
- Oh! She got you.
- Help me!

08:42.388 --> 08:44.334
God, just plug it up!

08:44.490 --> 08:45.730
Help!

08:46.125 --> 08:49.629
Plug it up!

08:52.798 --> 08:55.142
I'm sorry. No!

08:57.470 --> 08:58.608
No!

08:59.472 --> 09:01.349
Plug it up!

09:09.815 --> 09:11.852
Girls, come on! Move!

09:12.018 --> 09:13.190
Ladies.

09:15.187 --> 09:18.327
- Oh, my God. Okay. All right.
- Help me.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.664
Okay, honey, stand up.
Let's get you cleaned up.

09:20.826 --> 09:21.861
Help me, help me.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.100
Oh, Carrie, come on.

09:23.262 --> 09:24.707
Stand up.
Come on, can you stand up?

09:24.764 --> 09:26.368
It hurts! It hurts!

09:26.532 --> 09:29.945
It hurts! Somethings not right.
Somethings not right.

09:30.102 --> 09:32.446
Okay, okay.
What are you talking about?

09:32.605 --> 09:34.516
Ms. Desjardin,
I don't think she knows it's her period.

09:34.607 --> 09:36.109
No!

09:36.175 --> 09:38.678
All right, Sue.
Get out of here! You're not helping.

09:38.844 --> 09:41.290
- No! No!
- Calm down!

09:43.182 --> 09:45.628
Everyone get out! Now! Out!

09:47.053 --> 09:49.499
Okay, deep breaths.
Come here.

09:50.323 --> 09:53.065
Come on. It's okay.
You're okay, sweetie.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.130
It's totally normal.

09:55.227 --> 09:56.433
Shh.

09:57.063 --> 09:58.406
Do you know what it means?

10:04.036 --> 10:05.310
Okay, sweetie.

10:08.708 --> 10:10.585
Are you, uh, feeling better?

10:11.043 --> 10:12.386
Can I get you some aspirin?

10:12.912 --> 10:14.892
Some juice or something?

10:14.947 --> 10:16.187
Juice? Really, Henry?

10:17.750 --> 10:19.752
Maybe you just
want us to leave you alone.

10:20.386 --> 10:24.334
Carrie, honey,
lam so sorry that I slapped you.

10:24.924 --> 10:26.835
I should have handled it better.

10:27.526 --> 10:31.167
It's totally normal
for young girls to get their periods.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.867
It usually actually happens
a little bit earlier.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.410
Is this your first time?

10:42.441 --> 10:45.854
Honey, do you understand
what's happening to your body?

10:46.012 --> 10:47.252
Do you know what it means?

10:47.313 --> 10:48.451
What?

10:49.749 --> 10:52.025
I don't know.
I felt something moving down there.

10:52.184 --> 10:53.527
- Oh, honey.
- Whoa!

10:53.686 --> 10:57.224
Maybe you could, uh,
talk to a counselor about that

10:57.390 --> 10:59.063
OI' a nurse.

10:59.525 --> 11:03.405
Um, what I need to know
is who started throwing...

11:04.363 --> 11:05.364
...things.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.874
It was Chris Hargensen
and all of her friends.

11:08.034 --> 11:09.104
- Cassie...
- "Carrie."

11:09.402 --> 11:12.110
Carrie, did Chris Hargensen start this?

11:12.571 --> 11:14.016
Honey, you don't have to protect them.

11:14.073 --> 11:15.916
What they did was unforgiveable.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.651
Okay, uh...

11:18.711 --> 11:22.090
it doesn't seem that Carrie
is going to point the finger,

11:22.148 --> 11:25.618
so Ms. Desjardin,
I need you to get to the bottom of this.

11:25.685 --> 11:28.188
Let the punishment fit the crime.

11:28.254 --> 11:29.255
Okay.

11:30.122 --> 11:32.159
Carrie, you're excused
from P.E. class for the rest of the week.

11:32.224 --> 11:34.568
Just take study hall, okay?
At the library.

11:34.627 --> 11:36.629
Yeah. We're going
to have to call your mom.

11:38.431 --> 11:39.432
What?

11:39.999 --> 11:42.309
We're going to have to
call your mother, Carrie.

11:43.169 --> 11:45.581
I know she's had
problems with us in the past,

11:45.638 --> 11:48.244
ever since the state stopped her from

11:48.307 --> 11:49.843
homeschooling you anymore,

11:49.909 --> 11:52.082
but we've got to bring
her into this, okay?

11:52.144 --> 11:53.145
Mmm-mmm. No.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.748
Sweetie, we have no choice.

11:54.814 --> 11:56.350
- We have to tell your mom what happened.
- No.

12:02.521 --> 12:03.522
Carrie.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.045
Hey. Hey, You.

12:45.030 --> 12:47.670
Tina, give it to me. Give it here.

12:47.733 --> 12:49.804
This is brilliant. Look at this video.

12:49.869 --> 12:53.282
<i>Plug it up!</i>

12:53.372 --> 12:55.613
She got her period. On my hand.

12:58.043 --> 12:59.750
That is so disgusting.

13:00.813 --> 13:03.885
It was on my hand and Sue's shirt.
It was so disgusting.

13:08.521 --> 13:09.625
Mmm.

13:26.205 --> 13:28.583
I'm sorry you had
to come to school today, Mom.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.698
Let's go inside, little girl.

13:45.124 --> 13:46.501
You need to come inside with me.

13:47.293 --> 13:48.863
Mama, why didn't you tell me?

13:48.928 --> 13:51.636
I was so scared, Mama.
I thought I was going to die.

13:51.797 --> 13:54.368
Mama, they laughed at me
and they threw things at me.

13:55.134 --> 13:57.045
We'll talk about this inside, Carrie.

14:00.039 --> 14:01.109
No.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.509
I want to talk about it right here.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.214
I don't want to go inside with you.

14:23.963 --> 14:25.874
Crazy Carrie, Crazy Carrie!

14:27.833 --> 14:29.574
Crazy Carrie, Crazy Carrie.

15:10.042 --> 15:12.522
Oh, Lord, help my child.

15:12.778 --> 15:14.121
She's lost.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.291
Mama, stop it.

15:19.551 --> 15:20.689
Mama!

15:23.088 --> 15:24.931
I don't want to upset you.

15:32.798 --> 15:34.471
So, you're a woman now.

15:36.635 --> 15:39.377
And God made Eve from the rib of Adam.

15:40.372 --> 15:42.716
- And what, Carrie? Say it.
- No, Mama.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.448
- Say it.
- Talk to me.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.817
- Please just talk to me.
- And Eve was weak.

15:46.979 --> 15:48.720
I just want you to talk to me.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.261
And the first sin was
the sin of intercourse.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.795
And the first sin was
the sin of intercourse.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.456
Why didn't you tell me, Mama?

15:56.622 --> 15:58.431
And God visited Eve with a curse.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.163
And the curse was a curse of blood.

16:00.225 --> 16:01.568
I'm not going to say that.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.766
That's not even in the Bible.
it doesn't say that anywhere.

16:03.829 --> 16:06.833
Oh, Lord. Help this little girl
see the sin of her days and ways.

16:06.899 --> 16:07.969
Show her if she had remained innocent,

16:08.033 --> 16:10.104
the curse of blood would
not have come upon her as it did on Eve.

16:10.169 --> 16:12.672
I'm not Eve, Mama. I didn't sin.

16:12.838 --> 16:15.216
You showered with those other girls.

16:15.274 --> 16:16.514
You had lust-filled thoughts.

16:16.575 --> 16:19.556
Everyone has to shower, Mama.
Everyone. That's just the rules.

16:19.611 --> 16:21.648
You must be different,
because He can see you.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.694
I don't want to be different, Mama.
I want to be like them.

16:23.749 --> 16:25.228
He can smell the sin on you.

16:25.284 --> 16:27.025
And He will punish you.

16:27.086 --> 16:29.589
I will not let that
come down upon you. I will not.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.032
Lord have mercy.

16:31.090 --> 16:34.230
No. "The Lord is good.
His unfailing love endures forever,

16:34.293 --> 16:37.763
"and his faithfulness continues
through all generations."

16:37.830 --> 16:38.934
Psalms 100, verse 5.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.068
I'm going to keep you
away from that school.

16:40.132 --> 16:42.635
- You can't.
- We'll pray. We'll pray together.

16:42.701 --> 16:45.648
To save our women-weak,
wicked, sinning souls.

16:45.704 --> 16:48.014
You didn't tell me and they laughed.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.211
I didn't sin, you sinned.

16:52.344 --> 16:53.948
I did not.

16:55.814 --> 16:57.452
I did not sin.

17:05.656 --> 17:07.193
Go to your closet.

17:10.561 --> 17:11.563
No, Mama.

17:11.663 --> 17:13.165
Go to your closet and pray.

17:17.301 --> 17:18.541
You pray.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.039
No.

17:22.473 --> 17:23.578
No!

17:23.642 --> 17:24.746
No!

17:24.810 --> 17:27.619
Get off me! Mama! Stop it!

17:27.679 --> 17:29.417
Go to your closet and
pray for forgiveness.

17:29.443 --> 17:29.877
No!

17:29.915 --> 17:31.656
- You pray.
- Mama! Help!

17:35.187 --> 17:37.258
- No, Mommy!
- Come on.

17:37.423 --> 17:38.925
Please! Help!

17:43.262 --> 17:46.266
You pray, little girl.
Pray for forgiveness.

17:46.331 --> 17:49.375
Mommy, let me go!
Let me out!

17:54.440 --> 17:55.578
Mom!

17:56.608 --> 17:58.144
God, you suck!

18:09.621 --> 18:11.601
Help me. Help me.

19:09.781 --> 19:10.953
What?

19:11.783 --> 19:13.820
- I'm sorry.
- What?

19:22.327 --> 19:24.000
Hey. What's wrong?

19:24.963 --> 19:27.204
I really messed up today, Tommy.

19:28.033 --> 19:30.035
What, that thing with Carrie?

19:30.102 --> 19:31.445
You know about that?

19:31.870 --> 19:33.872
Yeah, everyone knows about it,

19:33.939 --> 19:36.681
but you're not responsible
for what Chris does.

19:37.142 --> 19:39.349
Yeah, but it was me, too.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.756
You threw tampons at Carrie White?

19:48.020 --> 19:50.193
I kicked a kid in the ribs once.

19:51.723 --> 19:53.430
Yeah, while he was knocked out.

19:53.492 --> 19:54.971
Because this kid,

19:55.027 --> 19:57.803
he used to beat the living shit out of me
every day in sixth grade.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.501
Danny Patrick.

20:07.172 --> 20:09.015
Did you apologize to Carrie?

20:09.074 --> 20:11.281
Did you apologize
to Danny Patrick?

20:11.343 --> 20:13.550
No, but we're not in sixth grade anymore.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.381
Don't.

20:15.681 --> 20:17.558
He was a dick to me.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.528
What did Carrie White ever do to you?

20:23.422 --> 20:24.730
Whoo!

20:27.759 --> 20:31.866
And that, ladies and gentlemen,
is why he lost his license.

20:32.030 --> 20:33.839
Then why
are you still driving?

20:33.999 --> 20:35.774
I don't need a license
if they can't catch me.

20:38.103 --> 20:39.912
Jackie's email, Jackie's email!

20:43.375 --> 20:45.787
Chris, no. No!

20:46.945 --> 20:49.926
Wow. Why don't you two
kiss or something while you're at it?

20:52.017 --> 20:53.394
Oh, baby.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.863
Don't be stupid.

21:02.728 --> 21:03.729
Wait.

21:04.930 --> 21:07.069
Do you think we're going to get detention
because of that?

21:07.232 --> 21:09.212
- Because that would suck.
- No.

21:10.202 --> 21:14.514
They should be thanking us
for helping her through her first period.

21:14.573 --> 21:16.575
I got her a tampon. So what?

21:16.642 --> 21:18.588
You were only trying to help her, right?

21:18.644 --> 21:20.214
We should post it.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.426
No, I'm in it.

21:24.383 --> 21:26.454
No one's going to see you, Teenie.

21:26.785 --> 21:29.561
What?  What are you doing?

21:34.459 --> 21:37.303
Carrie White.

21:39.598 --> 21:40.872
Favorite movie?

21:40.932 --> 21:41.967
<i>Bloodsport.</i>

21:43.935 --> 21:45.778
Favorite drink?

21:47.439 --> 21:50.215
Bloody Mary.

21:52.077 --> 21:54.455
Brightly <i>beams</i>

21:54.513 --> 21:57.426
Our Father's mercy

21:57.482 --> 22:03.558
<i>From His lighthouse evermore</i>

22:03.989 --> 22:09.302
<i>But to us He gives the keeping</i>

22:09.795 --> 22:15.871
<i>of the lights along the shore</i>

22:16.935 --> 22:21.350
<i>Let the lower lights be burning</i>

22:42.294 --> 22:43.932
Did you finish your prayers, little girl?

22:46.498 --> 22:48.000
Yes, Mama.

22:48.166 --> 22:50.077
That's my good girl.

22:53.004 --> 22:54.506
I love you.

22:55.407 --> 22:57.045
I love you, too, Mama.

23:15.327 --> 23:17.273
All right, stand up.

23:17.796 --> 23:19.366
Line up, please.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.973
You have a big week
coming up. A big month, actually.

23:24.035 --> 23:28.677
Probably the biggest month of your lives.
Prom and then graduation.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.242
Are you excited?

23:31.176 --> 23:33.247
You probably all have your dresses.

23:34.846 --> 23:36.757
You have your dates by now.

23:37.549 --> 23:39.358
What about you, Chris?

23:40.419 --> 23:42.057
Who's the lucky guy?

23:42.120 --> 23:43.793
Billy Nolan. You don't know him.

23:43.855 --> 23:45.027
He doesn't go to this school.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.570
Are you going to get him a boutonniere?

23:47.626 --> 23:50.004
Or are you just going to pin
a bloody tampon to his lapel?

23:50.629 --> 23:52.233
I so don't need to hear this.

23:52.297 --> 23:53.708
You're not going anywhere.

23:56.568 --> 23:58.377
What about you, Sue?

23:58.703 --> 24:02.014
Are you and Tommy busy campaigning
to be Prom King and Queen?

24:02.207 --> 24:04.050
I would have voted for you.

24:05.076 --> 24:06.419
Not now.

24:07.879 --> 24:10.155
You all did a shitty thing yesterday.

24:10.982 --> 24:12.962
A really shitty thing.

24:13.718 --> 24:16.631
And one of you
had the audacity to post a video.

24:18.323 --> 24:20.394
Somebody made a video of it?

24:20.459 --> 24:21.961
This is bullshit.

24:22.060 --> 24:25.234
That's it. Thanks to Miss Hargensen,
you're all running suicides.

24:25.297 --> 24:26.605
I'm not doing it.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.372
That's up to you.

24:29.067 --> 24:33.675
That's up to all of you, but anyone
who stops running is suspended.

24:33.738 --> 24:36.719
And if you're suspended,
you're not going to prom.

24:37.576 --> 24:40.853
While you're running,
I'd like for you to think long and hard

24:40.912 --> 24:43.859
about what it would be like
to be Carrie White.

24:53.558 --> 24:54.730
I'll be okay, Mama.

24:54.793 --> 24:57.137
I'm going to leave work early today
and pick you up after school.

25:16.948 --> 25:18.723
She can't do this to me.

25:18.783 --> 25:20.888
Just let it go, Chris. We're almost done.

25:20.952 --> 25:22.431
Then every day this week?

25:22.487 --> 25:24.467
All because of Carrie White?

25:25.357 --> 25:27.166
Like hell I will.

25:27.225 --> 25:28.966
Keep moving, Hargensen.

25:29.027 --> 25:31.064
Keep running or you're
not going to prom.

25:31.129 --> 25:32.437
Fuck you!

25:34.165 --> 25:35.337
This is child abuse.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.401
What did you say to me?

25:36.768 --> 25:39.578
I'm not going to run another goddamn inch

25:39.638 --> 25:41.242
because Carrie White got her period

25:41.306 --> 25:44.310
and was too stupid to know what it was.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.447
- What?
- You're suspended.

25:46.511 --> 25:49.617
You're out of prom
and you're out of my class. Now.

25:49.681 --> 25:51.160
- No.
- No?

25:51.216 --> 25:53.992
You can't decide that.
She can't do this to us.

25:54.052 --> 25:56.760
Goodbye, Chris.
The rest of you, keep at it.

25:56.821 --> 25:58.095
Someone could die of dehydration.

25:58.156 --> 26:00.158
Tina, you have a heart condition, right?

26:00.225 --> 26:03.638
If we all stick together,
they're not going to suspend all of us.

26:03.695 --> 26:08.041
They're not going to keep us all from prom.
There would be no prom.

26:08.099 --> 26:09.237
Nik, Lizzy?

26:09.734 --> 26:10.974
Let's go, ladies!

26:11.770 --> 26:12.840
Heather?

26:14.272 --> 26:18.311
This is bullshit!
We didn't do anything wrong.

26:18.376 --> 26:20.014
All right, let's go.

26:20.078 --> 26:23.082
Right, Sue?
You're with me on this, right?

26:23.348 --> 26:24.452
Come on.

26:25.951 --> 26:26.952
Sue.

26:28.053 --> 26:29.054
Come on.

26:34.759 --> 26:36.602
Keep going, ladies.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.269
This isn't over.

26:42.467 --> 26:44.640
This isn't over by a long shot.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.785
That's Carrie White.

28:50.762 --> 28:52.537
Um, you know... Sorry.

28:52.597 --> 28:55.737
I was just going to say,
you can make it full-screen. Watch.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.520
All right, who's next?

29:11.116 --> 29:14.029
Uh, Carrie. Favorite poem.
Did you bring one?

29:16.621 --> 29:17.622
Yeah.

29:17.689 --> 29:19.760
Why don't you come to
the front of the class

29:19.824 --> 29:21.132
and share it with us all?

29:38.977 --> 29:42.823
"This unfrequented place
to find some ease

29:44.649 --> 29:48.119
"Ease to the body some, none to the mind

29:49.220 --> 29:54.397
"Times past,
and what once I was and what am now

29:54.492 --> 29:57.496
"O wherefore was my birth
from Heaven foretold

29:58.663 --> 30:01.269
"Twice by an Angel, who at last in sight

30:01.332 --> 30:04.939
"Of both my Parents all in flames...

30:06.971 --> 30:08.041
"...ascended."

30:12.343 --> 30:15.119
Okay, uh, that was, uh...

30:15.580 --> 30:17.526
...disturbing.

30:17.582 --> 30:20.620
That is the most
you've said in class all year.

30:20.685 --> 30:21.925
Is there anything else
you'd like to share

30:21.986 --> 30:23.693
or are you done scaring
us for the day?

30:23.755 --> 30:25.428
Asshole.

30:25.590 --> 30:27.900
Excuse me, Mr. Ross.
Did you say something?

30:28.493 --> 30:29.995
I said, "Awesome."

30:31.796 --> 30:34.208
I just thought
what Carrie read was awesome.

30:35.967 --> 30:37.378
Didn't you, Mr. Ulmann?

30:39.504 --> 30:41.450
All right, who's next? Uh...

30:43.007 --> 30:44.418
Nicki.

30:44.475 --> 30:45.977
I mean, Lizzy.

30:56.821 --> 30:58.391
Is anyone working?

31:00.558 --> 31:01.901
Excuse me.

31:05.296 --> 31:06.832
Is anybody working?

31:16.207 --> 31:17.652
Oh, Margaret.

31:18.076 --> 31:21.785
I'm sorry to disturb you.
I don't know where Hugo and Gloria...

31:21.846 --> 31:23.621
Can I help you, Mrs. Snell?

31:23.681 --> 31:25.024
Yes, I'm picking up.

31:31.656 --> 31:34.262
Margaret, I want to say how sorry I am

31:34.325 --> 31:36.396
about what happened at the school.

31:36.494 --> 31:40.670
There's no excuse for what Sue did,
but she's a good girl.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.110
Are any of those girls good?

31:49.540 --> 31:52.817
Oh, that is beautiful work, Margaret.

31:53.111 --> 31:54.419
Thank you.

31:55.546 --> 31:58.652
I love what you've done
with the neckline.

31:58.716 --> 32:01.697
And the stitches.
You can barely see them.

32:01.753 --> 32:04.962
So few people can sew like this anymore.

32:05.023 --> 32:08.163
I could never do anything
like this myself.

32:08.226 --> 32:10.206
Sue's going to look beautiful.

32:10.261 --> 32:12.571
I am so excited for her.

32:12.630 --> 32:14.871
I remember my prom.

32:14.933 --> 32:17.812
Anyway, she's going to love it.

32:20.038 --> 32:22.382
These are Godless times, Mrs. Snell.

32:28.046 --> 32:29.389
<i>This gym teacher
was running Chrissie</i>

32:29.447 --> 32:30.949
into the ground and used profanity.

32:31.015 --> 32:32.858
I believe the term "shitty" was used.

32:32.917 --> 32:34.555
She can't do that.
It's abuse of power.

32:34.619 --> 32:37.429
You're right, Daddy.
That's what she said.

32:37.488 --> 32:39.900
"Shitty." She's really abusive.

32:39.958 --> 32:43.496
Ms. Desjardin was reprimanded
for what happened in class today.

32:43.561 --> 32:45.666
But you know we've had a lot of problems

32:45.730 --> 32:46.834
with your daughter in the past.

32:46.898 --> 32:50.402
And now, with what she did
to her classmate, Carrie White.

32:50.468 --> 32:52.641
The girl was having her...

32:52.704 --> 32:54.206
What your daughter and her posse...

32:54.272 --> 32:56.718
I'm not going to sit here
and listen to half-truths.

32:56.774 --> 32:58.879
I know my daughter.
She said she didn't do it.

32:58.943 --> 33:00.889
I want her prom privileges restored.

33:01.446 --> 33:03.687
You can't prove she did anything,
can you?

33:04.482 --> 33:07.463
I believe that there is a
video of the incident.

33:08.486 --> 33:10.693
And I think
your daughter is the one who took it.

33:11.756 --> 33:15.363
I think a video like that would probably
be pretty damning to anyone in it

33:15.426 --> 33:17.099
and to the person who made it.

33:17.161 --> 33:18.936
Don't you, Mr. Hargensen?

33:18.997 --> 33:21.375
I don't know.
I'm just a gym teacher,

33:21.432 --> 33:25.403
but it seems like a video like that
would probably affect college admissions,

33:25.470 --> 33:29.748
possibly a lawsuit,
tons of bad publicity.

33:29.841 --> 33:32.447
I wonder what The <i>Today</i> Show
would do with a video like that.

33:32.510 --> 33:35.514
I think we should just look at her phone
and if it's not there,

33:35.580 --> 33:39.392
I owe you a huge apology
and she should be allowed to go to prom.

33:40.785 --> 33:41.786
Chris.

33:45.890 --> 33:47.335
Chris.

33:48.259 --> 33:50.136
Daddy,
I'm not going to give them my phone.

33:50.194 --> 33:51.696
I have personal things on here.

33:51.763 --> 33:53.936
Isn't that invasion of
privacy or something?

33:55.099 --> 33:57.045
Chrissie, if you want to go to prom,

33:57.101 --> 33:59.707
just give them the damn phone
and we can be done with this.

33:59.771 --> 34:00.909
I have to get back to work.

34:00.972 --> 34:02.076
Dad.

34:02.140 --> 34:04.916
God damn it,
just give them your phone, Chris.

34:08.146 --> 34:09.250
No.

34:21.426 --> 34:24.532
So, I'm officially out of the prom.

34:27.197 --> 34:29.906
I bet that cocksucker Morton
loses his job, though.

34:30.768 --> 34:32.475
My dad is suing him.

34:32.770 --> 34:35.216
Jesus, Sue, why didn't
you stand up for me?

34:35.873 --> 34:37.819
We could have had them by the balls.

34:38.376 --> 34:41.414
We deserved it
for what we did to Carrie White.

34:42.647 --> 34:44.251
I thought I deserved it.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.587
Desjardin was right.
We did a shitty thing for no reason.

34:47.652 --> 34:49.654
Bullshit!

34:49.719 --> 34:52.724
That Carrie goes around saying
that everyone but her and her mother

34:52.790 --> 34:55.235
are going to hell
and you stuck up for her? Come on!

34:55.293 --> 34:57.671
You can be such a pig sometimes, Chris.

34:57.728 --> 34:59.071
What did Carrie White ever do to you?

34:59.130 --> 35:01.838
She's been begging for it
since the sixth grade, Sue.

35:01.899 --> 35:03.344
I got to go.

35:04.802 --> 35:07.078
I seem to remember you were in there

35:07.138 --> 35:09.015
throwing shit with the rest of us.

35:09.073 --> 35:11.485
What was it that she was calling her?

35:11.542 --> 35:13.488
- "Freak"?
- I stopped.

35:14.979 --> 35:16.890
Oh, you stopped?

35:16.981 --> 35:18.858
- Yeah.
- Why did you keep running?

35:19.050 --> 35:20.188
Hmm?

35:20.485 --> 35:22.294
- Why did you keep running, Sue?
- Stop it, Chris!

35:22.353 --> 35:24.890
You kept running,
Sue, little Suze,

35:24.956 --> 35:27.630
because you've been dreaming
about senior year

35:27.692 --> 35:30.332
and the perfect boyfriend
and the perfect prom

35:30.394 --> 35:31.998
your whole goddamned life.

35:32.096 --> 35:33.769
You already booked the hotel,

35:34.499 --> 35:37.708
already practiced the sounds
you're going to make

35:37.768 --> 35:40.374
when you and Tommy
make love.

35:41.873 --> 35:45.116
That's why you had this
bullshit change of heart.

35:47.345 --> 35:49.552
You don't give a shit about Carrie White.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.889
And everybody knows it.

35:54.318 --> 35:57.356
Okay.
I'll see you around, Sue.

37:21.939 --> 37:22.940
Carrie?

37:44.662 --> 37:45.732
Carrie?

38:01.345 --> 38:04.588
I'm not going to let
anyone hurt you, little girl.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.763
You're safe here with me.

38:25.369 --> 38:26.643
Got it.

38:35.846 --> 38:36.847
Hey.

38:39.483 --> 38:41.224
- How are you doing?
- Good.

38:41.285 --> 38:42.525
- Good?
- Yeah.

38:43.321 --> 38:46.734
- What's up?
- I want you to take Carrie White to prom.

38:49.627 --> 38:51.300
Good one, babe.
Come on.

38:56.133 --> 38:57.271
Are you serious?

38:57.335 --> 38:58.939
I'm just trying to fix what I did.

38:59.003 --> 39:01.609
Yeah.
I get that, but this is...

39:01.672 --> 39:02.742
Sue, it's nuts.

39:02.807 --> 39:04.115
Okay, so it's nuts.

39:04.175 --> 39:07.622
But after what we did to her,
I have to do something.

39:07.678 --> 39:09.589
I have to do something
that counts.

39:09.680 --> 39:10.988
Uh...

39:11.048 --> 39:13.494
What even makes you think
that she would say yes to me?

39:13.551 --> 39:14.586
She'd say yes.

39:14.652 --> 39:16.256
We've barely even spoken.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.994
I saw how she looked at you in class
when you rescued her.

39:19.056 --> 39:21.161
What girl doesn't
want to go to prom?

39:22.059 --> 39:24.505
What girl doesn't want one magical night?

39:26.864 --> 39:28.571
Maybe I can give
that up for her.

39:28.632 --> 39:31.169
No. Babe, I want you
to have that magic night.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.978
I don't want to go to prom
with Carrie White.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.483
I want to go to
prom with you.

39:36.173 --> 39:37.516
I can't go.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.843
Hey, Carrie.

40:02.633 --> 40:05.136
I was looking for you at the library

40:05.202 --> 40:06.408
because that's where they said you were.

40:06.470 --> 40:09.815
But, uh, you weren't there,
so I figured maybe you were here.

40:14.779 --> 40:17.191
<i>"Telekinesis: Unlocking the Mind."</i>

40:17.248 --> 40:20.388
No, no.
Is that about, uh, hypnosis?

40:20.551 --> 40:22.462
Because me and my friends, we tried that.

40:22.520 --> 40:24.796
We actually hypnotized my boy's dog.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.397
Anyway, um...

40:31.662 --> 40:33.005
How are you doing?

40:35.232 --> 40:36.506
I'm okay.

40:37.301 --> 40:38.302
Cool.

40:40.738 --> 40:42.809
So you know how, um,
prom is next week?

40:43.808 --> 40:45.082
You know?

40:46.043 --> 40:47.488
Um, I was wondering,

40:47.545 --> 40:50.321
if you don't have a date already,
maybe you want to go with me.

40:56.187 --> 40:57.222
What?

40:57.288 --> 40:59.666
The prom. Next week.

41:07.998 --> 41:08.999
Carrie.

41:13.704 --> 41:14.705
Hey.

41:22.646 --> 41:24.319
- Carrie.
- Stop!

41:26.517 --> 41:29.225
Please, just stop trying to trick me.

41:29.386 --> 41:31.832
No, I'm not trying to trick you.
I'm not tricking you.

41:31.989 --> 41:33.297
Aren't you with Sue Snell?

41:33.357 --> 41:36.270
Yeah, I'm with Sue Snell,
but she doesn't want to go.

41:39.797 --> 41:41.003
I'm sorry.

41:59.717 --> 42:01.856
Did one of the girls try
something again?

42:02.853 --> 42:03.854
No.

42:09.727 --> 42:11.570
I got invited to prom.

42:12.396 --> 42:13.568
Really?

42:15.733 --> 42:18.543
That's great news.

42:19.103 --> 42:20.548
With who?

42:23.507 --> 42:25.180
It's Tommy Ross.

42:28.546 --> 42:30.787
Wow. Tommy Ross?

42:32.049 --> 42:34.461
He is pretty dreamy, huh?

42:37.021 --> 42:38.022
Yeah.

42:39.757 --> 42:41.759
I know who he goes
around with.

42:44.929 --> 42:46.931
They're just going to
trick me again.

42:49.934 --> 42:51.140
Right?

42:52.403 --> 42:54.246
Maybe he really meant it.

42:55.139 --> 42:56.140
No.

42:57.441 --> 42:59.284
Yes, of course he did.

43:00.377 --> 43:01.549
Why?

43:03.747 --> 43:05.727
Why would he want
to go with me?

43:07.451 --> 43:08.623
Come here.

43:16.327 --> 43:17.965
Do you know what I see?

43:19.930 --> 43:21.773
I see a beautiful young woman.

43:24.101 --> 43:25.978
Maybe wear a little make-up.

43:27.104 --> 43:28.947
Pinch your cheeks a little bit,

43:29.173 --> 43:30.914
put some color in there.

43:31.575 --> 43:33.020
Curl your hair.

43:33.510 --> 43:35.114
Stand up straight.

43:35.746 --> 43:37.350
There you go.

43:40.851 --> 43:42.387
Come on, Sue.

43:42.453 --> 43:44.524
You and Chris are best friends.
If you two...

43:44.588 --> 43:48.866
If you three are planning on playing a
joke on a lonely, defenseless girl...

43:48.926 --> 43:50.371
This has nothing to do with Chris.

43:50.427 --> 43:52.964
Or you, Miss Desjardin.
And for me...

43:54.665 --> 43:58.238
Listen, with due respect, Miss
Desjardin, this is between Sue and me.

43:58.302 --> 44:00.748
It's kind of like a private thing.

44:00.804 --> 44:02.681
And what is the big deal anyway?

44:02.740 --> 44:03.980
It's just for one night, right?

44:05.342 --> 44:07.879
Famous athletes like
Tim Tebow,

44:07.945 --> 44:11.392
he takes kids to prom all the time
and everyone loves him for it.

44:12.116 --> 44:13.220
Really?

44:14.284 --> 44:15.786
You're hardly a famous athlete.

44:15.853 --> 44:17.298
This is a really big deal for her.

44:17.354 --> 44:18.594
Listen. it doesn't matter.

44:19.123 --> 44:20.602
She said no.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.604
- So you'll try again.
- Don't.

44:22.660 --> 44:23.900
- Okay.
- It's not okay.

44:25.295 --> 44:26.330
Tommy.

44:27.297 --> 44:30.301
When you show up to prom
with Carrie White on your arm,

44:30.367 --> 44:33.439
don't you think you're going to look
the tiniest bit ridiculous?

44:33.504 --> 44:35.814
We don't care how we look. Do we?

44:38.308 --> 44:39.309
No.

44:41.011 --> 44:42.149
Come on.

45:02.533 --> 45:03.739
What are you doing here?

45:03.801 --> 45:05.337
Aren't you going to ask me in?

45:05.402 --> 45:07.439
What do you want?
You can't be here.

45:07.504 --> 45:10.212
Right to the point, huh?
Cool. About the prom.

45:11.075 --> 45:12.315
You kind of left me hanging.

45:12.376 --> 45:13.878
I already told you.

45:13.944 --> 45:16.447
I know, but I was hoping
that you'd change your mind.

45:18.248 --> 45:20.194
Girls change their mind all the time.

45:23.187 --> 45:24.359
Why are you doing this?

45:24.421 --> 45:25.798
Because I want to.

45:27.558 --> 45:29.128
You need to leave.

45:30.094 --> 45:32.040
I'm not leaving until you say yes.

45:34.364 --> 45:35.900
Why is this so important to you?

45:35.966 --> 45:38.173
Because I think
that we would have a good time.

45:41.872 --> 45:46.582
And because I think
that what you read in class was cool.

45:47.978 --> 45:50.322
I looked up that book
in the library myself.

45:51.782 --> 45:55.662
That's the guy who brought
the temple down. Samson, right?

46:00.257 --> 46:01.258
Yes.

46:02.760 --> 46:04.603
Yes, okay, I'll go.

46:05.763 --> 46:07.436
I have to be back by 10:30.

46:09.233 --> 46:10.576
Sure, okay. Um...

46:10.834 --> 46:12.814
I'll pick you up here at 7:00?

46:14.338 --> 46:15.339
Okay.

46:44.334 --> 46:46.974
Crazy, right?
Tommy Ross and Carrie White.

47:45.829 --> 47:49.367
Where have you been?
I was worried sick. Come on. Come inside.

47:49.533 --> 47:51.274
- I'm sorry I'm late, Mama.
- Just get inside.

47:55.038 --> 47:58.542
Your supper's cold.
I'm going to have to heat it up.

47:58.709 --> 48:00.052
I didn't know...

48:02.346 --> 48:03.723
You're immodest.

48:04.548 --> 48:07.324
I didn't know where you were.
I didn't know.

48:07.384 --> 48:10.365
No, Mama. I took a bus to Main Street
and I bought cloth for a dress.

48:10.954 --> 48:14.766
You are not to go anywhere
but to school and back. You know that.

48:14.925 --> 48:17.633
Mama, before you say anything else,
I've been asked to prom.

48:21.231 --> 48:23.802
Mama, I've been asked to prom.

48:25.869 --> 48:27.507
Oh, God, why?

48:27.571 --> 48:30.211
It's next Saturday and
he's a very nice boy.

48:30.274 --> 48:33.084
And he'll come and meet you before
and he promised to have me home by 10:30.

48:33.243 --> 48:35.723
- No, no, no.
- I already accepted.

48:38.415 --> 48:40.088
I know this scares you.

48:42.085 --> 48:43.587
It scares me, too.

48:44.588 --> 48:45.760
The other kids,

48:46.290 --> 48:47.894
they think I'm weird.

48:49.493 --> 48:51.097
But I don't want to be.

48:52.429 --> 48:55.433
I have to try to be a whole person.

48:57.267 --> 48:58.905
Before it's too late.

49:04.841 --> 49:06.218
He'll hurt you.

49:08.412 --> 49:09.948
No, Mama.

49:10.013 --> 49:12.391
No, Mama, there are bad people,
but not Tommy.

49:12.449 --> 49:14.690
He's good.
You'll like him. He's a very nice boy.

49:14.751 --> 49:17.027
Boys, boys.
After the blood,

49:17.087 --> 49:20.034
comes the boys sniffing,
slobbering like dogs.

49:20.090 --> 49:21.398
Stop it, Mama.

49:21.458 --> 49:24.200
He's going to paw at you until he finds
where that blood smell comes from.

49:24.261 --> 49:26.639
He's going to take you, Carrie,
in his car out to the wilderness,

49:26.697 --> 49:28.870
out where it's cold
and the roadhouses are and the whiskey.

49:28.932 --> 49:30.172
Stop being so crazy.

49:30.233 --> 49:31.439
You tell that boy you're not going.

49:31.501 --> 49:32.571
No.

49:32.636 --> 49:34.582
We'll move from here.
We're never going to stop moving.

49:34.671 --> 49:36.446
You're going to go to your closet
and you're going to pray.

49:36.506 --> 49:38.816
You're going to get in there
and you're going to pray for forgiveness.

49:38.875 --> 49:40.286
No, never again, Mama!

49:55.525 --> 49:56.970
Mama, stand up.

50:02.699 --> 50:04.144
Mama, stand up!

50:10.807 --> 50:12.047
Mama, I'm going.

50:13.744 --> 50:16.384
- Witch.
- I'm not a witch, Mama.

50:17.581 --> 50:18.685
There are no witches.

50:18.749 --> 50:20.820
The devil's got her now.
Like he did before.

50:20.884 --> 50:23.865
It's not the devil, Mama.
There are other people out there like me

50:23.920 --> 50:24.955
who can do what I can do.

50:25.022 --> 50:27.901
You poor child.
Don't you know he's working through you?

50:27.958 --> 50:30.165
Mama, it's inherited.
It was passed down from Grandma

50:30.227 --> 50:31.501
and it skipped you.

50:31.561 --> 50:34.940
You know that. Maybe it came from Daddy.

50:34.998 --> 50:37.444
He gave me a cancer.
I thought you were cancer.

50:39.770 --> 50:42.842
- That's awful. Don't say that.
- She's lost to me.

50:44.074 --> 50:46.350
Pray all you want, Mama, but I'm going.

50:49.546 --> 50:51.423
And nothing's going to stop me.

50:58.588 --> 51:00.727
And I don't want to
talk about it anymore.

51:11.435 --> 51:13.108
What are we doing?

51:13.170 --> 51:15.377
What does this have to do
with Carrie White?

51:15.539 --> 51:19.783
Baby, you said
you wanted us to do something about her.

51:27.551 --> 51:28.894
It's a Piggy!

51:32.122 --> 51:34.068
Here, piggy, piggy.

51:34.624 --> 51:36.729
Here, piggy, piggy.

51:36.793 --> 51:38.136
It smells like shit in here.

51:39.062 --> 51:42.168
Chris, pick one.
Pick one that looks like her.

51:43.900 --> 51:45.607
Pig's blood for a pig.

51:53.276 --> 51:54.516
That one.

51:55.745 --> 51:56.780
Go on.

51:58.849 --> 52:01.295
One quick swing, all right?

52:01.485 --> 52:02.793
I got this.

52:08.258 --> 52:09.532
Don't worry, little piggy,

52:09.593 --> 52:11.800
Uncle Jack is going
to bash your head right in.

52:12.629 --> 52:13.767
You're not going to feel one...

52:13.830 --> 52:15.707
Shut up! Do it already. Jesus.

52:22.105 --> 52:23.277
I can't.

52:23.673 --> 52:25.653
God, you guys are such goddamn pussies.

52:25.809 --> 52:26.879
Shut up!

52:29.346 --> 52:30.654
I'm sorry, Billy.

52:47.030 --> 52:48.509
Come on, you got this.

52:57.340 --> 53:00.753
All right, it's just
one quick slice and...

53:01.077 --> 53:02.351
Oh, my God.

53:06.183 --> 53:07.253
Good job, baby.

53:27.604 --> 53:30.016
Sue. Hey, are you okay?

54:16.553 --> 54:17.896
There we go.

55:00.463 --> 55:02.773
Billy. Hurry up.

55:04.267 --> 55:05.746
Oh, my God.

55:05.802 --> 55:08.976
When the time comes,
I'll let you pull the rope, okay?

55:09.039 --> 55:10.347
Oh, I plan on it.

55:47.844 --> 55:49.221
Did you guys see Sue today?

55:49.279 --> 55:51.122
She looked awful.

55:51.281 --> 55:52.521
I know Chris isn't coming.

55:52.582 --> 55:53.754
She's suspended.

55:53.917 --> 55:55.055
Do you think she'll crash?

55:55.118 --> 55:56.358
You never know with Chris, right?

56:02.792 --> 56:04.465
So, I think I'm going to
have the after-party.

56:08.198 --> 56:09.199
No.

56:09.799 --> 56:11.642
- What do you think?
- Down?

56:11.801 --> 56:12.802
No.

56:14.270 --> 56:15.271
Yeah.

56:24.114 --> 56:25.286
Whoo!

56:55.879 --> 56:57.415
Will you pin it on me, Mama?

56:58.047 --> 56:59.048
Red.

56:59.682 --> 57:01.025
I might have known it would be red.

57:01.084 --> 57:02.324
It's pink.

57:08.658 --> 57:11.901
I can see your dirty pillows.
Everyone will.

57:13.329 --> 57:14.467
Breasts, Mama.

57:15.698 --> 57:19.407
Breasts. You have them
and every woman has them.

57:19.769 --> 57:21.612
Take off that dress, Carrie.

57:22.539 --> 57:23.540
No.

57:23.706 --> 57:26.414
Take it off and we'll burn it together
and pray for forgiveness.

57:26.476 --> 57:27.921
Mama, it's modest.

57:27.977 --> 57:29.854
Call that boy and tell him
you're not going.

57:29.913 --> 57:32.393
You just tell him you're sick.

57:32.449 --> 57:33.757
I don't want you to get hurt.

57:33.817 --> 57:36.024
Or you could just be
happy for me.

57:42.459 --> 57:44.234
Mama, stop hurting yourself.

57:44.594 --> 57:46.699
You know it's not going
to make me stay.

57:50.767 --> 57:53.111
He's not coming. It's a trick.

57:56.906 --> 57:58.476
Same as always.

57:59.742 --> 58:01.380
He's going to come.

58:01.444 --> 58:02.821
They're going to laugh at you.

58:02.879 --> 58:04.153
They're all going to laugh at you.

58:04.214 --> 58:06.251
Mama, stop it.

58:06.316 --> 58:08.091
I'm nervous enough as it is.

58:14.190 --> 58:15.191
Thank you, sir.

58:20.597 --> 58:22.508
You see, Mama?

58:22.565 --> 58:24.010
You see, it's all going to be okay.

58:24.067 --> 58:26.707
Oh, repent. It's not too late.

58:26.769 --> 58:30.080
Mama, don't ruin this for me.
I'll be home early.

58:30.139 --> 58:32.619
I'm going to have to
tell that boy the truth

58:32.675 --> 58:34.086
that your father took me
and you were born of sin.

58:34.143 --> 58:35.679
- You'll say nothing, Mama.
- And from that sin...

58:38.147 --> 58:40.787
From that sin
was born another.

58:40.850 --> 58:42.158
The worst sin.

58:42.218 --> 58:43.925
"A man or a woman who is a witch

58:43.987 --> 58:45.466
"among you is to be put to death.

58:45.522 --> 58:46.694
"You are to stone them."

58:48.625 --> 58:50.298
I'm warning you, Mama.

58:50.360 --> 58:51.634
The devil's hand.

58:52.595 --> 58:54.097
Please don't do this.

58:56.332 --> 58:58.403
There will be a judgment, Carrie.

58:58.468 --> 59:01.074
As Jezebel fell from
the tower, you too...

59:12.949 --> 59:15.623
Mama, you're not going to say
another word until I'm gone.

59:33.303 --> 59:34.873
Mommy, I'm sorry.

59:39.042 --> 59:40.487
I love you.

59:43.680 --> 59:45.182
I'll be home early.

01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:28.257
Hi.

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:30.029
Hi.

01:00:30.593 --> 01:00:32.231
Do I look okay?

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:35.807
You look beautiful.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.831
Tommy, can we wait a minute?

01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:02.828
Yeah, sure,
we can wait as long as you want.

01:01:08.531 --> 01:01:10.010
Are you scared?

01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:13.239
They're not that bad.

01:01:14.671 --> 01:01:16.344
Besides, I need you in there.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.287
Dancing by myself all night,
I'd look awful silly.

01:01:22.645 --> 01:01:24.318
Here, let me fix this.

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:31.195
I think this is supposed to
go on your wrist.

01:01:33.923 --> 01:01:34.958
There.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:37.831
Are you ready?

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:14.135
God, you look handsome, Ross.

01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:16.302
Dawson!

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:20.440
Don't worry. If they kill each
other, I'll dance with you.

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:23.450
Carrie, this is my best buddy,
George Dawson.

01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:26.487
And this is his girlfriend, Erika.
She goes to Dover.

01:02:26.542 --> 01:02:27.543
Hi.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.622
Come on, I'll show you the table.

01:02:33.683 --> 01:02:35.663
I love your dress.
Where did you get it?

01:02:35.718 --> 01:02:37.061
I made it.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.599
No kidding. Really?

01:02:38.654 --> 01:02:40.258
- Yeah.
- That's amazing.

01:02:55.004 --> 01:02:56.142
Do you want to dance?

01:03:03.513 --> 01:03:06.517
Or, if you want,
we could wait for a slower song.

01:03:07.183 --> 01:03:08.184
Yeah.

01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:13.628
I'll be back.

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:18.401
Miss Desjardin.

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:21.241
You look beautiful.

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:25.177
I'll let you two ladies talk.

01:03:25.234 --> 01:03:27.510
Uh, do you want some punch?

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:29.550
I heard Greg and Harry spiked it.

01:03:29.605 --> 01:03:30.777
Really?

01:03:31.707 --> 01:03:33.311
No, I'm just kidding.

01:03:40.283 --> 01:03:41.318
You're doing okay?

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:43.159
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:04:02.738 --> 01:04:03.808
Listen.

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:10.150
Do you really have to
be home so early?

01:04:11.414 --> 01:04:12.757
I promised.

01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:14.726
Yeah, I know.
I understand.

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:18.527
But, um, a bunch of people,
we're going to the Cavalier after.

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:20.693
- That's okay.
- What is?

01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:23.993
I know you want to hang out
with your friends, and that's...

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.061
No.

01:04:28.965 --> 01:04:30.535
It's a slow song.

01:04:31.601 --> 01:04:32.636
No.

01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:34.172
Yeah. Come on.

01:04:34.237 --> 01:04:36.308
No, Tommy.
I've never danced before.

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:38.909
- It's okay.
- No, I can't. I can't do it.

01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:41.785
You can't go to prom
and not have at least one dance.

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:42.879
I can't.

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:46.449
Carrie White,
will you have this dance with me?

01:04:51.487 --> 01:04:52.693
Come on.

01:04:53.723 --> 01:04:54.963
Come on.

01:05:08.404 --> 01:05:11.078
It's so easy. Take this hand in my hand.
Like this, see?

01:05:12.241 --> 01:05:14.983
You're going to put this hand
on my shoulder.

01:05:15.044 --> 01:05:16.523
And I put my hand on your hip.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.988
Then we sway.

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:21.157
See, it's easy.

01:05:22.084 --> 01:05:23.927
You've got nothing to worry about.

01:05:23.986 --> 01:05:25.727
And you're good, you're a good learner.

01:05:27.223 --> 01:05:29.567
And then, if you want to
get fancy with it,

01:05:29.625 --> 01:05:31.662
<i>we can do the Dancing With The Stars.</i>

01:05:31.827 --> 01:05:33.170
- Yeah.
- No.

01:05:33.329 --> 01:05:34.899
Yeah. Ready? Look.

01:05:45.274 --> 01:05:46.844
To the first one.

01:05:48.044 --> 01:05:49.580
This is fun, right?

01:06:06.595 --> 01:06:08.040
Tommy, why am I here?

01:06:08.097 --> 01:06:10.134
Because I invited you.

01:06:10.199 --> 01:06:11.405
But why?

01:06:12.368 --> 01:06:13.972
Carrie, we're here.

01:06:14.937 --> 01:06:18.885
We're at prom.
I'm having such a great time with you.

01:06:20.042 --> 01:06:21.248
You are?

01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:23.412
Yeah.

01:06:24.113 --> 01:06:27.890
And I hope
that you're having a good time with me.

01:06:28.384 --> 01:06:29.419
Yeah.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:34.060
So, what do you say
we dance a little longer,

01:06:36.959 --> 01:06:41.237
and then we see which poor fool
they crown King and Queen,

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:43.903
and then we go to the Cavalier?

01:06:44.633 --> 01:06:48.638
And I'll have you home by 10:30.
How does that sound to you?

01:06:50.906 --> 01:06:52.442
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:55.147
Maybe 11:00.

01:06:55.211 --> 01:06:56.417
Whatever you want.

01:06:58.981 --> 01:07:00.289
11:00.

01:07:37.620 --> 01:07:41.227
<i>All right, everyone,</i>
<i>take your seats. Take your seats.</i>

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:43.793
<i>It's now time to vote for your King</i>

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:46.999
<i>- and Queen of the prom. All right.</i>

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:53.070
<i>Ballots are an the table.
Everyone gets their own, please.</i>

01:07:53.135 --> 01:07:55.137
<i>Guys, take your seats.</i>

01:07:55.638 --> 01:07:56.639
Here.

01:07:59.642 --> 01:08:02.384
<i>Make an "X" beside
the candidate of your choice.</i>

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:04.491
<i>Let's have the best prom ever.</i>

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:05.787
<i>Whoa!</i>

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:07.523
<i>All right.</i>

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.340
Tommy, we're on here.

01:08:21.397 --> 01:08:22.398
Don't you want to be on there?

01:08:22.465 --> 01:08:23.773
Do you?

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:25.107
Why not?

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:26.874
If we win, the only thing that happens is

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:28.711
we have to go up there on those thrones,

01:08:29.537 --> 01:08:31.848
wave a scepter around
while they play the school song,

01:08:31.907 --> 01:08:35.514
and then, uh, do a little dance
so everyone can see how idiotic we look.

01:08:36.679 --> 01:08:38.488
They are beautiful.

01:08:38.546 --> 01:08:40.254
You're beautiful.

01:08:41.684 --> 01:08:44.358
So, who do we vote for?

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:47.060
I guess they're more
your crowd than mine.

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:48.227
I don't really have a crowd.

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:50.392
Well, I think we vote
for ourselves, right?

01:08:52.027 --> 01:08:54.029
No. No, don't vote for us.

01:08:55.197 --> 01:08:57.143
To the devil with false modesty.

01:09:09.444 --> 01:09:10.947
To the devil.

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:17.758
- Hurt yourself?
- No.

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:21.700
To my boy, George Dawson,
to the Fearsome Four,

01:09:21.756 --> 01:09:24.828
Mike, Matt, Brian, and Brad.
I'm going to miss you guys.

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:27.170
- All set?
- Oh, yeah.

01:09:29.732 --> 01:09:32.109
Good luck, kids.
You've got my vote.

01:09:33.903 --> 01:09:35.176
More ballots for you.

01:09:35.237 --> 01:09:36.408
Hey, girl.

01:10:06.502 --> 01:10:07.947
Here you go.

01:10:09.772 --> 01:10:11.513
As soon as that bucket goes, we run.

01:10:11.574 --> 01:10:13.576
We don't stick around for the laughs
or the screams or anything.

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:15.548
All right?

01:10:16.946 --> 01:10:18.220
You got it?

01:10:19.448 --> 01:10:21.121
Are you listening? Hey.

01:10:21.817 --> 01:10:23.455
- What?
- When they get up there,

01:10:23.519 --> 01:10:25.328
what's happening?
You're pulling the rope and when the...

01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:27.731
- Shut up so I can hear.
- Hey. Listen to me. Listen.

01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:29.963
If you get caught
and you say anything about what we did,

01:10:30.025 --> 01:10:31.561
I will fucking kill you.

01:10:31.627 --> 01:10:33.538
This isn't what
you bitches did in the shower.

01:10:33.596 --> 01:10:34.802
This is criminal assault.

01:10:34.863 --> 01:10:36.900
This is fucking jail time
if we're caught.

01:10:36.966 --> 01:10:38.138
I get it.

01:10:50.646 --> 01:10:53.889
Hey. Whatever happens tonight,
you're Queen, okay?

01:10:54.049 --> 01:10:58.361
And the results are in.
And it was very, very close.

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:04.861
A drum roll, please.

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:10.904
By one vote, our winners are...

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:14.010
Tommy Ross and Carrie White!

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:22.418
Come on.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.918
Way to go, Carrie.

01:11:53.809 --> 01:11:55.288
Heather, where's Chris?

01:11:55.444 --> 01:11:57.446
What are you talking about?
She's not here.

01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:11.337
Hey, what's wrong?
Come on, go. You can do this.

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:18.838
We are fucking doing this.
It's too late to go back now.

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:20.639
Ewen High...

01:12:20.803 --> 01:12:24.751
I give you your newly crowned
King and Queen of the prom,

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.948
Tommy Ross and Carrie White.

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:31.089
- Pull it!
- Shut up, Billy!

01:12:39.254 --> 01:12:40.699
- Chris.
- Sue?

01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:46.232
Sue.

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:48.070
What are you doing?
Come on. Come on, let's go.

01:12:48.263 --> 01:12:50.368
No! Miss Desjardin, it's not me.
It's Chris.

01:12:50.532 --> 01:12:51.943
Pull it, Billy, pull it!

01:12:52.101 --> 01:12:53.273
Don't ruin this for Carrie.

01:12:53.335 --> 01:12:54.871
- It's not me!
- Come on. Out.

01:12:58.607 --> 01:12:59.642
- Let her have this.
- No, wait!

01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:47.556
What the hell?

01:13:47.956 --> 01:13:51.062
<i>Plug it up!</i>

01:13:52.561 --> 01:13:54.507
Please help me!

01:13:56.231 --> 01:13:58.336
<i>Plug it up!</i>

01:14:05.974 --> 01:14:07.920
Carrie, wait. Carrie.

01:14:08.777 --> 01:14:10.120
Help me.

01:14:11.647 --> 01:14:12.853
<i>No!</i>

01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:18.796
<i>- Freak! Freak!
- Come on.</i>

01:14:30.299 --> 01:14:31.937
Carrie, come on.

01:14:39.374 --> 01:14:40.478
Tommy.

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:55.463
Tommy.

01:14:58.327 --> 01:14:59.670
Tommy, no.

01:15:03.065 --> 01:15:04.169
No.

01:15:10.939 --> 01:15:12.680
Fuck.

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:14.650
You have an inch.

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:15.984
Yeah. Come on.

01:15:16.411 --> 01:15:18.015
Go, go. Come on.

01:15:34.396 --> 01:15:36.535
- Come on.
- Are you seeing this?

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:41.245
- Wait.
- Come on.

01:16:00.389 --> 01:16:01.595
There's been an explosion.

01:16:06.094 --> 01:16:07.437
Don't panic!

01:16:10.432 --> 01:16:11.536
Bleachers!

01:16:37.492 --> 01:16:39.062
We have to get to the door.

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:40.297
Nicki!

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:43.676
- Lizzy!
- Nicki!

01:17:14.663 --> 01:17:16.768
- Come on! We got to go!
- Okay.

01:17:17.699 --> 01:17:19.042
Tina, come on!

01:17:19.101 --> 01:17:20.341
We're all going to die!

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:21.976
Come on!

01:19:07.442 --> 01:19:08.785
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:19:08.844 --> 01:19:11.415
- Nothing.
- Do you think this is a fucking game?

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:12.823
Shut up.

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:16.620
What are we going to do?

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:20.931
We're going to leave town
and we're never going to come back.

01:19:23.558 --> 01:19:26.937
Okay? It's okay. It's going to be okay.

01:19:27.129 --> 01:19:28.164
Okay.

01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:55.164
Oh, my God! Watch out!

01:20:04.766 --> 01:20:06.211
Shit town!

01:20:06.768 --> 01:20:08.213
Go, move!

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:13.683
Oh, my God.

01:20:13.975 --> 01:20:15.318
It's Carrie.

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:20.957
Run her down.

01:20:21.516 --> 01:20:22.517
Kill her.

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:25.623
Kill her, Billy.
Kill her, Billy! Kill her!

01:20:25.687 --> 01:20:26.961
Shut up! I got this.

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:31.304
Come on!

01:20:43.872 --> 01:20:45.010
Billy?

01:20:46.141 --> 01:20:47.142
Billy?

01:20:48.009 --> 01:20:49.079
Billy?

01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:52.719
No.

01:23:19.194 --> 01:23:21.834
Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:27.173
Mama?

01:23:28.737 --> 01:23:29.977
Mama?

01:24:03.271 --> 01:24:04.409
Mama?

01:24:18.019 --> 01:24:19.191
Mama!

01:24:47.816 --> 01:24:48.886
No.

01:24:49.984 --> 01:24:51.122
No.

01:24:52.053 --> 01:24:53.054
No.

01:25:10.505 --> 01:25:12.007
I'm so sorry.

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:30.095
Mama?

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:34.899
Mama?

01:25:41.002 --> 01:25:42.310
Oh, Mama.

01:25:42.937 --> 01:25:44.507
Mama, you were right.

01:25:44.973 --> 01:25:46.953
They laughed at me, Mommy.

01:25:47.575 --> 01:25:49.418
They all laughed at me.

01:25:49.577 --> 01:25:51.579
I knew they'd hurt my little girl.

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:57.426
I should have killed myself
when he put it in me.

01:26:01.022 --> 01:26:02.968
We slept in the same bed,

01:26:03.691 --> 01:26:05.193
lived together sinlessly.

01:26:06.027 --> 01:26:09.668
Then one night,
I saw him look at me in that way.

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:13.904
And we got down on our knees
to pray for strength.

01:26:17.038 --> 01:26:18.813
And that's when he took me.

01:26:18.873 --> 01:26:22.480
No, Mama. I don't want to hear it.

01:26:22.544 --> 01:26:24.888
- And I liked it.
- Mama, no.

01:26:24.946 --> 01:26:28.553
I should have given you to God
when you were born, but...

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:31.353
I was weak.

01:26:32.387 --> 01:26:34.731
And I loved you so much.

01:26:36.858 --> 01:26:38.633
And I said, "God,

01:26:39.494 --> 01:26:41.735
"let me keep my little girl.

01:26:43.198 --> 01:26:44.871
"Let me keep her."

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:47.175
Let's pray.

01:26:48.369 --> 01:26:49.677
Yes, Mama.

01:26:51.372 --> 01:26:52.715
Yes, we'll pray.

01:26:53.141 --> 01:26:56.520
I'll be the preacher.
You'll be my congregation.

01:27:01.583 --> 01:27:04.894
"Our Father, Who art in heaven,

01:27:05.486 --> 01:27:07.227
"hallowed be Thy name.

01:27:07.722 --> 01:27:09.326
"Thy kingdom come,

01:27:10.158 --> 01:27:11.694
"Thy will be done

01:27:13.094 --> 01:27:14.573
"on earth

01:27:16.397 --> 01:27:19.241
"as it is in heaven."

01:27:21.035 --> 01:27:22.241
Mama!

01:27:36.517 --> 01:27:37.860
Mama, please.

01:27:40.755 --> 01:27:42.666
No, Mama. Mama, please.

01:27:43.891 --> 01:27:46.098
This isn't your fault, Carrie. It's mine.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:49.039
- Mommy, this isn't right.
- You know the devil never dies.

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:52.874
He keeps coming back.
You've got to keep killin' him.

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:56.643
- No, Mama.
- Over and over again.

01:27:56.704 --> 01:27:58.615
Mama, please. Mama!

01:28:06.314 --> 01:28:07.816
No!

01:28:08.983 --> 01:28:10.291
No, Mama.

01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:18.903
Mama, stop it!

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:56.335
- Carrie.
- I'm sorry.

01:28:56.497 --> 01:28:57.601
Carrie!

01:30:02.263 --> 01:30:03.401
Okay.

01:30:07.168 --> 01:30:08.579
It's okay.

01:30:17.345 --> 01:30:20.258
It's okay. No one's going to hurt you.

01:30:22.617 --> 01:30:24.597
No one's going to hurt you.

01:30:42.770 --> 01:30:43.908
Carrie?

01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:48.782
Let me help you, Carrie.

01:30:51.179 --> 01:30:53.216
Why couldn't you leave me alone?

01:30:53.281 --> 01:30:54.487
I'm sorry.

01:30:58.486 --> 01:31:00.488
Look what you turned me into.

01:31:00.721 --> 01:31:02.291
Don't hurt me, Carrie.

01:31:02.457 --> 01:31:03.902
Why not?

01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.433
I've been hurt my whole life.

01:31:21.609 --> 01:31:23.646
I killed my mom.

01:31:27.515 --> 01:31:29.153
I want her back.

01:31:31.652 --> 01:31:33.188
I'm scared.

01:31:53.941 --> 01:31:55.818
We've got to get out of here!

01:31:56.043 --> 01:31:57.681
Give me your hand.

01:31:57.945 --> 01:31:59.390
Give me your hand.

01:32:00.615 --> 01:32:01.821
Come on!

01:32:08.022 --> 01:32:10.161
- It's a girl.
- What?

01:32:10.324 --> 01:32:11.735
You don't know?

01:32:12.793 --> 01:32:14.170
Oh, my God.

01:32:20.535 --> 01:32:21.843
Get out!

01:32:22.570 --> 01:32:23.878
Get out!

01:32:56.737 --> 01:32:58.011
It's okay.

01:33:36.577 --> 01:33:39.148
<i>Miss Snell,
we 're trying to determine the exact role</i>

01:33:39.213 --> 01:33:41.716
<i>Carrie White played in the tragedy
an prom night.</i>

01:33:41.782 --> 01:33:45.025
You would agree that you were under
an enormous amount of stress.

01:33:45.086 --> 01:33:48.033
Isn't it possible
that what you saw was a natural act?

01:33:49.890 --> 01:33:53.565
My boyfriend,
most of my friends, died that night,

01:33:53.628 --> 01:33:56.234
but I know what I saw.

01:33:57.965 --> 01:33:59.842
<i>You want an explanation?</i>

01:34:00.901 --> 01:34:02.972
<i>Carrie had some sort of power,</i>

01:34:04.071 --> 01:34:06.017
<i>but she was just like me,</i>

01:34:06.741 --> 01:34:08.311
<i>like any of you.</i>

01:34:08.743 --> 01:34:10.984
<i>She had hopes and she had fears.</i>

01:34:12.246 --> 01:34:13.850
<i>And we pushed her.</i>

01:34:20.254 --> 01:34:22.791
<i>And you can only push
someone so far</i>

01:34:25.326 --> 01:34:26.964
<i>before they break.</i>

01:35:03.931 --> 01:35:06.912
<i>I can hardly make you mine</i>

01:35:07.902 --> 01:35:10.678
<i>Tell it to you all the time</i>

01:35:12.239 --> 01:35:16.745
<i>At the end of a long day</i>
<i>and when I wake</i>

01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:22.017
<i>If you could just give me a sign</i>

01:35:23.517 --> 01:35:26.498
<i>We could leave it all behind</i>

01:35:28.155 --> 01:35:32.069
<i>Stop taking the long way before we play</i>

01:35:35.563 --> 01:35:39.943
<i>I don't think I can make it
and I know you're the one</i>

01:35:43.504 --> 01:35:47.577
<i>Staring into the tears like a loaded gun</i>

01:36:22.109 --> 01:36:25.022
<i>Well, I can hardly make you mine</i>

01:36:26.213 --> 01:36:28.853
<i>Tell it to you all the time</i>

01:36:31.018 --> 01:36:35.125
<i>But you never wanted,
but you had to take</i>

01:36:37.725 --> 01:36:40.831
<i>So I can never give you up</i>

01:36:41.862 --> 01:36:44.866
<i>I guess it's 'cause it's
just a crush</i>

01:36:46.367 --> 01:36:50.440
<i>Before the end of a long
day and then I wake</i>

01:36:55.142 --> 01:36:58.680
<i>But I know you're not
the one or the only</i>

01:37:03.117 --> 01:37:06.724
<i>But we both know what it's
like to be lonely</i>

01:37:08.956 --> 01:37:12.836
<i>Well, these fantasies,
they left us lonely</i>

01:37:12.893 --> 01:37:16.136
<i>Boy, just bring all your
love back to me</i>

01:37:18.465 --> 01:37:21.844
<i>I guess for now this is how it'll be</i>

01:37:25.239 --> 01:37:29.346
<i>I don't think I can make it</i>
<i>Oh, you're the one</i>

01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:37.592
<i>Staring into the tears
like a loaded gun</i>

01:37:40.988 --> 01:37:45.198
<i>I don't think I can make it</i>
<i>Oh, you're the one</i>

01:37:48.896 --> 01:37:53.402
<i>Staring into the tears
like a loaded gun</i>

01:37:54.305 --> 01:38:00.491
