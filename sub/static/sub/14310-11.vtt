You're a very brave
little Smurfette.

10:29.149 --> 10:32.190
It's dangerous, Clumsy.
But I know you can do it.

10:32.210 --> 10:35.090
Don't worry about me,
Papa Smurf.

10:35.110 --> 10:37.230
doink

10:38.009 --> 10:39.110
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

10:41.019 --> 10:43.230
Soon it will boil,
and I wonder which one of you

10:44.009 --> 10:46.210
will dissolve first, hmm?
Ha-ha-ha!

10:46.230 --> 10:49.210
Will it be you? Yow!

10:49.230 --> 10:51.110
Why, you..

10:52.190 --> 10:54.080
What's that?

10:54.100 --> 10:56.110
Why, it's gold.

11:00.029 --> 11:01.090
[coin clinking]

11:04.149 --> 11:06.090
More gold.

11:06.110 --> 11:07.159
whoosh

11:09.179 --> 11:11.169
[mews]

11:11.190 --> 11:13.049
Smurfs, where are you?

11:13.070 --> 11:15.039
(Jokey)
'We're cooking in the pot!'

11:15.059 --> 11:17.009
[Smurfs clamoring]

11:21.039 --> 11:23.070
Catch me if you can, Azrael.

11:24.039 --> 11:25.100
whoosh

11:25.120 --> 11:27.210
[clanking]

11:27.230 --> 11:29.210
Smurfs, this way.

11:29.230 --> 11:33.080
Gold, a mountain of gold.

11:33.100 --> 11:35.159
Hey!

11:35.179 --> 11:38.090
Azrael, get them.
Don't let them get away.

11:38.110 --> 11:40.029
(Papa Smurf)
'Now, Smurfette.'

11:40.049 --> 11:41.100
twang

11:41.120 --> 11:43.019
[mews]

11:43.039 --> 11:46.029
One of these days,
miserable, rotten Smurfs

11:46.049 --> 11:47.220
you will pay. Do you hear?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.090
Pay, pay, pay!

11:50.110 --> 11:54.090
Oh, Gargamel.
You say the sweetest things.

11:54.110 --> 11:57.059
[laughter]

11:58.049 --> 12:00.110
Ah. Success.

12:00.129 --> 12:03.190
Sometimes it takes a lot
of work and many failures..

12:03.210 --> 12:05.190
'...before an experiment
finally works.'

12:05.210 --> 12:08.070
Hurray for Papa Smurf.

12:08.090 --> 12:10.059
[cheering]

12:10.080 --> 12:15.100
Oh, Papa Smurf, how could I
ever have doubted you? Mwah.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.120
That's right,
you can't believe

12:17.139 --> 12:20.049
every scroll you read
I always say.

12:20.070 --> 12:23.000
That's why I didn't believe
for one minute

12:23.019 --> 12:25.090
that Papa Smurf..

12:25.110 --> 12:28.049
...had lost his powers.

12:28.070 --> 12:31.000
Oh, well,
at least when I get out of here

12:31.019 --> 12:34.000
I'll be rich, Azrael.
Rich, rich, rich.

12:34.019 --> 12:35.080
[meows]

12:35.100 --> 12:37.129
[thunder rumbling]

12:37.149 --> 12:39.070
What's this?

12:39.090 --> 12:41.139
whoosh

12:41.159 --> 12:42.210
It's Papa Smurf.

12:42.230 --> 12:45.029
He's behind all this.

12:45.049 --> 12:46.100
[grumbling]

12:47.230 --> 12:52.080
I'll get them for this, Azrael.
I'll get them all!

12:52.100 --> 12:54.190
[Azrael grumbling]

12:57.230 --> 13:00.120
