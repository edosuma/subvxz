Book him for burglary.

slow walk through the system.

06:05.340 --> 06:06.723

She was taken just before

06:27.779 --> 06:29.912
No witnesses.
What about school security?

06:29.914 --> 06:31.531
Kidnapper attacked the security
guard, fractured his skull.

06:31.533 --> 06:33.199
Sent him to the hospital
in critical condition.

06:33.201 --> 06:35.251
Wasn't able to give a statement.

06:35.253 --> 06:37.420
School's locked down. We have

Hey, Duke, I just sent
a guy your way.

06:41.259 --> 06:42.959

uncomfortable, all right?

06:42.961 --> 06:44.177
We'll take good
care of him.

06:44.179 --> 06:45.178
Hey, Chin, we got
somebody going

06:45.180 --> 06:46.346
through the security camera
footage?

06:46.348 --> 06:47.947
Yeah, CSU's going
through it right now.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.966
So far, nothing.
What do we know about the family?

06:49.968 --> 06:51.217
Lives with her parents
on Ford Island.

06:51.219 --> 06:52.468
STEVE:
Wait a minute.

06:52.470 --> 06:53.553
They're a military family?

06:53.555 --> 06:54.804
Yeah. Father's a Navy SEAL,

06:54.806 --> 06:56.105
stationed overseas.

06:56.107 --> 06:57.523
Mother's a
social worker.

06:57.525 --> 07:00.276
This is one of the most
expensive schools on the island.

07:00.278 --> 07:01.644
How can they afford this place?

07:01.646 --> 07:02.645
Sophie's here on scholarship.

07:02.647 --> 07:03.980
STEVE:
Okay, well, if this is about

07:03.982 --> 07:05.481
a ransom,
it's not gonna end well

07:05.483 --> 07:06.649
when the kidnapper realizes

07:06.651 --> 07:08.571
he grabbed the only girl
whose parents can't pay.

07:09.821 --> 07:11.371
Thanks so much. All right.
Thank you.

07:11.373 --> 07:12.739
STEVE:
Hey.

07:12.741 --> 07:13.990
Hey.
So, the director said

07:13.992 --> 07:15.541
that all the girls were
backstage before the recital.

07:15.543 --> 07:16.709
She didn't see anyone suspicious

07:16.711 --> 07:18.328
and wasn't aware
that Sophie was missing

07:18.330 --> 07:20.913
until the girls lined up
for the show. I was gonna

07:20.915 --> 07:22.665
go talk to some of the kids.
Maybe one of them saw something.

07:22.667 --> 07:23.833
Get every parent's camera
and cell phone.

07:23.835 --> 07:25.718
Maybe one of them
caught the kidnapper.

07:25.720 --> 07:27.003
All right, done.

07:27.005 --> 07:29.672
Okay, child predators

07:29.674 --> 07:31.641
do not, uh, come
to fancy private schools,

07:31.643 --> 07:33.559
knock out security guards.

07:33.561 --> 07:35.144
Way too many variables.

07:35.146 --> 07:37.847
They like malls, parks,
places where there's less risk.

07:37.849 --> 07:39.015
I absolutely agree.

07:39.017 --> 07:40.733
We need to look at everybody
in Sophie's life.

07:40.735 --> 07:42.602
See if there's been any threats
to the family.

07:42.604 --> 07:43.569
I mean, this could be personal.

07:43.571 --> 07:44.737
Where's Sophie's mom now?

07:44.739 --> 07:45.905
Grover took her home

07:45.907 --> 07:47.106
in case
the kidnappers makes contact.

07:47.108 --> 07:48.658
All right, have him
make a list of anybody

07:48.660 --> 07:51.027
connected to the family that may
have had reason to take Sophie.

07:51.029 --> 07:52.528
And then check them
for criminal records.

07:52.530 --> 07:54.530
Also, check
if there's been any similar

07:54.532 --> 07:55.865
abduction attempts
in the area recently.

07:55.867 --> 07:57.033
Got it.

07:57.035 --> 07:59.535
Somebody targeted Sophie
for a reason.

07:59.537 --> 08:01.754
<i>We need to find out why.</i>

08:06.961 --> 08:10.046
(door closes and locks)

08:13.468 --> 08:15.802
Please...

08:15.804 --> 08:20.022
I want to see my mommy.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.933
What's up?
We hear anything?

08:35.936 --> 08:37.352
Radio silence.

08:37.354 --> 08:38.687
I don't like it, man.

08:38.688 --> 08:40.438
We should have heard
something by now.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.357
Well, we still don't know
what this is about, Lou.

08:42.359 --> 08:44.909
It's looking less and less like
somebody close to the family.

08:44.911 --> 08:45.944
How do you know?

08:45.946 --> 08:47.362
HPD ran background checks

08:47.364 --> 08:49.698
on everybody on the list
that Angela Larkin gave me.

08:49.700 --> 08:51.416
No red flags.

08:51.418 --> 08:52.834
Nothing on the Larkins?
Nothing.

08:52.836 --> 08:54.452
No dirty laundry, no threats.

08:54.454 --> 08:56.037
These are good folks.

08:56.039 --> 08:59.040
You know, the father's
overseas defending our country.

08:59.042 --> 09:01.209
And then, something
like this happens.

09:01.211 --> 09:02.761
Man, it pisses me off.

09:02.763 --> 09:03.878
How's the mom doing?

09:03.880 --> 09:05.130
Daughter's missing,

09:05.132 --> 09:06.548
husband's 4,000 miles away.

09:06.550 --> 09:07.766
Do the math.

09:07.768 --> 09:09.017
Best thing we can do

09:09.019 --> 09:10.885
for her is just

09:10.887 --> 09:12.103
keep the information flowing.

09:12.105 --> 09:14.556
Believe me, not knowing
where things stand--

09:14.558 --> 09:16.558
that's what tears
you up the most.

09:23.233 --> 09:26.534
Ma'am, we know your husband
is overseas.

09:26.536 --> 09:27.902
Have you spoken
to him?

09:27.904 --> 09:29.954
We Skyped with him
this morning.

09:29.956 --> 09:33.041
I think he was heading
out on a mission.

09:33.043 --> 09:36.828
He never tells me, but
I can always sense it.

09:36.830 --> 09:39.831
I called his C.O., but

09:39.833 --> 09:42.634
haven't heard back.

09:44.054 --> 09:46.004
(sighs)

09:46.006 --> 09:48.473
I hate the thought that
he doesn't know what's going on.

09:48.475 --> 09:49.891
Look, we're gonna do
everything we can

09:49.893 --> 09:51.092
to get you in touch with him.

his position is classified.

09:55.649 --> 09:58.516
There's no way they're gonna
be able to get a hold of him.

09:58.518 --> 10:00.769
There has to be
something I can do.

10:00.771 --> 10:02.654
I can't just sit
here and do nothing.

10:02.656 --> 10:04.823
Actually, we need you
to just stay here by the phone.

10:04.825 --> 10:06.574
But we got the best people
on this.

10:07.994 --> 10:09.110
Mrs. Larkin,

10:09.112 --> 10:11.996
you and your husband
are 'ohana to me.

10:11.998 --> 10:14.332
Okay? I'm going
to do whatever it takes

10:14.334 --> 10:16.417
to find Sophie
and bring her home to you.

10:18.171 --> 10:20.455
(whispers):
Thanks.

10:23.343 --> 10:25.293
What are you thinking?

10:25.295 --> 10:27.345
If Lieutenant Larkin
is on a mission,

10:27.347 --> 10:30.048
I'm thinking whoever took her
is trying to compromise the op.

10:30.050 --> 10:32.267
Okay, it's a good theory.
How do you prove it?

10:33.186 --> 10:35.220
It's not the answer
I was looking for.

10:35.222 --> 10:37.355
I didn't say anything.
Yeah, you did. Come on.

10:42.529 --> 10:43.945
Now, you know I can't confirm

10:43.947 --> 10:45.780
whether Lieutenant Larkin's
on a mission, Commander.

10:45.782 --> 10:47.065
What I can tell you is,

10:47.067 --> 10:48.566
there have been
no security breaches

10:48.568 --> 10:50.068
on any of our current ops.

10:50.070 --> 10:52.287
Okay, um, sir,

10:52.289 --> 10:53.822
Lieutenant Larkin's
daughter was kidnapped

10:53.824 --> 10:55.373
just two hours ago,
all right?

10:55.375 --> 10:57.659
We believe that the mission
that he either is or is not on

10:57.661 --> 10:59.828
could be the key to getting her back.
That may be so,

10:59.830 --> 11:04.082
but I'm telling you, it's got
nothing to do with our ops.

11:04.084 --> 11:06.000
You're just gonna have
to take my word on that.

11:06.002 --> 11:07.719
STEVE: Yeah, with all
due respect, sir,

11:07.721 --> 11:10.054
we've, uh... we've been down
this road before, you and I,

11:10.056 --> 11:11.389
and...

11:11.391 --> 11:13.424
oh, you owe me.

11:15.145 --> 11:16.561
(chuckles)

11:16.563 --> 11:19.764
Well, you did save my ass
with that Chinese satellite.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.850
That much is true.
You're welcome.

11:21.852 --> 11:23.518
But, unfortunately,

11:23.520 --> 11:25.353
I've said all I can
on this matter.

11:25.355 --> 11:27.155
What about his files?

11:27.908 --> 11:30.074
Can you give us access
to his files?

11:30.076 --> 11:31.359
I can do that.

11:31.361 --> 11:32.694
Okay.
If his daughter's kidnapping

11:32.696 --> 11:34.579
has anything to do
with his service,

11:34.581 --> 11:36.414
there'll be a list
of suspects there.

11:36.416 --> 11:39.701
Uh, one more thing,
I'm sorry-- um, Angela,

11:39.703 --> 11:41.703
his wife, uh, has been trying
to get in touch with him.

11:41.705 --> 11:45.673
Is there any way we could make
that happen? That would be nice.

11:47.377 --> 11:50.461
I'm sensitive
to the situation, Detective.

11:50.463 --> 11:51.796
Truly, I am.

11:51.798 --> 11:54.966
And I'm sure as soon as
Lieutenant Larkin is available,

11:54.968 --> 11:57.685
he'll contact his wife.

11:58.521 --> 11:59.888
Let's go.

11:59.890 --> 12:01.439
Thank you.

12:06.863 --> 12:09.447
(sighs)

12:09.449 --> 12:10.899
We take an oath, Danny.

12:10.901 --> 12:12.150
I understand that.

12:12.152 --> 12:13.401
But this is
about the guy's family.

12:13.403 --> 12:14.953
You don't think
he's got a right to know?

12:14.955 --> 12:16.955
Of course he has a right
to know, all right?

12:16.957 --> 12:19.657
But right now his team needs him
focused and ready to lead.

12:19.659 --> 12:22.126
You tell him about his daughter,
you could put all their lives

12:22.128 --> 12:24.295
in danger and compromise
the entire mission.

12:24.297 --> 12:25.246
Well, let me tell you something
that you don't know,

12:25.248 --> 12:26.581
okay?
As a parent,

12:26.583 --> 12:27.882
when your child is in trouble,

12:27.884 --> 12:29.334
you can sense it.
You know about it.

12:29.336 --> 12:30.718
Like right now,
Lieutenant Larkin,

12:30.720 --> 12:32.420
he knows that.
He doesn't know why,

12:32.422 --> 12:34.055
but he knows it.
Don't you think that puts

12:34.057 --> 12:35.340
him and his team

12:35.342 --> 12:36.424
in just as much danger?

12:38.762 --> 12:41.095
Hi, Maggie.
So, I've been talking

12:41.097 --> 12:43.097
to some of the other girls
from the recital.

12:43.099 --> 12:45.600
Do you think it would be okay
if I asked you some questions?

12:46.453 --> 12:48.820
So, one
of the other girls said

12:48.822 --> 12:50.271
that she saw you
and Sophie go

12:50.273 --> 12:52.190
to the bathroom together
before the show

12:52.192 --> 12:53.825
but that you
came back alone.

12:53.827 --> 12:55.076
Now, is that true?

12:57.998 --> 13:00.581
Okay, so when
did you last see Sophie?

13:00.583 --> 13:02.283
It's okay, baby.

13:02.285 --> 13:03.501
It's okay.

13:04.337 --> 13:07.038
I left the bathroom.

13:07.040 --> 13:08.623
There was a man.

13:08.625 --> 13:11.292
He was with Sophie.

13:12.145 --> 13:13.211
Okay, you're doing great.

13:13.213 --> 13:14.796
Can you tell me

13:14.798 --> 13:16.180
what he looked like?

13:16.182 --> 13:18.182
MAGGIE:
I only saw his back.

13:18.184 --> 13:20.018
They were walking away.

13:20.020 --> 13:21.769
Was he tall or short?

13:21.771 --> 13:22.854
Tall.

13:22.856 --> 13:23.972
And what color was his hair?

13:23.974 --> 13:26.858
Like my daddy's.

13:26.860 --> 13:28.276
Brown?

13:29.529 --> 13:31.896
He was wearing
a blue baseball hat.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.815
Mahalo, Maggie.

13:33.817 --> 13:35.984
Hey, you're a brave girl.

13:35.986 --> 13:37.485
FATHER:
We'd like to take her home now.

13:37.487 --> 13:39.287
Is that okay?
Of course.

13:39.289 --> 13:40.655
Thank you.

13:40.657 --> 13:42.006
So, have security go
through the tapes

13:42.008 --> 13:43.992
and see if they can find anyone
that matches the description

13:43.994 --> 13:45.076
Maggie gave us.

13:45.078 --> 13:46.961
And then get it out to the media.
Got it.

13:46.963 --> 13:48.046
Thanks.

13:48.048 --> 13:49.330
So, all the doors
in this school

13:49.332 --> 13:50.798
require a keycard
for entry or exit, right?

13:50.800 --> 13:52.550
I had security compile a list

13:52.552 --> 13:54.719
of all the card swipes
from this morning.

13:54.721 --> 13:57.221
Six feet, brown hair; that
matches the description

13:57.223 --> 13:58.589
I just got. Who is he?

13:58.591 --> 13:59.807
Guy's name is Ben Sutor.

13:59.809 --> 14:00.892
He's a substitute teacher here,

14:00.894 --> 14:02.677
but he wasn't scheduled
to work today.

14:02.679 --> 14:04.312
His card was swiped, though,

14:04.314 --> 14:06.564
15 minutes before the recital
started and then again

14:06.566 --> 14:09.067
minutes after
Sophie disappeared.

14:29.039 --> 14:31.873
(dog barking outside)

14:37.931 --> 14:40.098
I got blood.

14:56.316 --> 14:58.366
He's alive.

14:58.368 --> 14:59.867
(sirens wailing,
indistinct radio communication)

14:59.869 --> 15:02.987
All right, so the kidnapper
targets the teacher,

15:02.989 --> 15:04.539
uses his card
to hit the school

15:04.541 --> 15:05.873
and grab Sophie.

15:05.875 --> 15:07.075
I don't get it.
You don't go through

15:07.077 --> 15:08.910
all this trouble unless
you have an end game, right?

15:08.912 --> 15:11.212
So why hasn't the kidnapper
made contact?

15:12.382 --> 15:13.714
(phone ringing)

15:20.757 --> 15:22.006
Hello?

15:22.008 --> 15:24.175
MAN: Mr. Porter,
I have your daughter.

15:24.177 --> 15:27.011
I want $1.6 million.

15:27.013 --> 15:29.931
I'll call back in 30 minutes
with more instructions.

15:29.933 --> 15:33.351
You call the police, she dies.

15:34.187 --> 15:35.853
What's wrong?

15:42.195 --> 15:43.945
Maggie...?

15:43.947 --> 15:46.114
(sighs)

15:50.286 --> 15:52.286
You did the right thing,
calling us.

15:52.288 --> 15:54.005
I'm Steve McGarrett.
This is Detective Williams.

15:54.007 --> 15:55.456
Hi.
Hey.

15:55.458 --> 15:56.674
What's going on?

15:56.676 --> 15:57.708
Your daughter and Sophie,

15:57.710 --> 15:58.843
they went
into the bathroom together.

15:58.845 --> 16:01.095
They had the same outfit on,
same hairstyle.

16:01.097 --> 16:02.296
Sophie wasn't their target.

16:02.298 --> 16:03.631
Maggie was.

16:05.018 --> 16:06.551
They took the wrong girl.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.100
The owner is
extremely motivated.

16:24.656 --> 16:28.108
This house will not be
on the market long.

16:28.110 --> 16:30.327
(metal screeching)

16:30.329 --> 16:31.711
You hear that?

16:31.713 --> 16:33.313
(metal clanging)

16:33.315 --> 16:34.931
No, I don't hear anything.

16:34.933 --> 16:36.716
(clanging continues)

16:36.718 --> 16:38.368
There.

16:38.370 --> 16:40.203
I hear it, too.

16:40.205 --> 16:42.873
It's coming from right over...

16:42.875 --> 16:46.009
here.

16:46.011 --> 16:47.961
AGENT:
Oh, that.

16:47.963 --> 16:49.296
That must be
the air conditioning,

16:49.298 --> 16:50.797
and those repairs
can be factored

16:50.799 --> 16:52.215
right into the closing costs.

16:52.217 --> 16:54.551
You guys hear that?

16:54.553 --> 16:57.771
(sensor device ticking)

16:57.773 --> 16:59.606
Jerry. (sighs)

16:59.608 --> 17:00.891
We've talked about this.

17:00.893 --> 17:03.560
You're not supposed to be
here when I'm showing.

17:03.562 --> 17:04.978
At first, I thought it might be
the pipes,

17:04.980 --> 17:06.730
but there's no running water,
so it can't be that.

17:06.732 --> 17:09.900
Okay, I assure you that there is
nothing wrong with the plumbing.

17:09.902 --> 17:12.152
(sensor device squeals)

17:13.454 --> 17:14.788
What is that thing?

17:14.790 --> 17:17.457
This... is an EMF reader.

17:18.877 --> 17:20.743
Measures telekinetic activity.

17:21.329 --> 17:23.713
You know...

17:23.714 --> 17:26.633
ghosts.

17:26.635 --> 17:28.885
(EMF reader squealing)

17:33.141 --> 17:34.341
Please!

17:34.343 --> 17:36.142
Let me explain.

17:36.144 --> 17:37.594
Sorry it didn't work out!

17:37.596 --> 17:40.030
(car doors slamming)

17:40.032 --> 17:42.349
So, your mom finally
did it, huh?

17:42.351 --> 17:43.567
Yeah, Moneypenny
wasn't bluffing.

17:43.569 --> 17:44.768
(tires squealing)
Bought a place on Maui.

17:44.770 --> 17:46.937
Said she wants to be
closer to her family.

17:46.939 --> 17:49.022
How am I supposed
to take that?

17:49.024 --> 17:51.107
(chuckles)
Well, there comes a time

17:51.109 --> 17:53.360
when moms finally leave
the nest, Jer.

17:53.362 --> 17:55.278
Yeah, but things
were going so well.

17:55.280 --> 17:56.413
Then she pulls this.

17:56.415 --> 17:58.415
Right when I'm on
to something huge.

17:58.417 --> 18:01.368
Oh, right, Steve and Danny told
me about the, uh, bookstore.

18:01.370 --> 18:02.535
Not a bookstore, Chin.

18:02.537 --> 18:04.120
It's a front
for a counterfeiting operation.

18:04.122 --> 18:06.456
It's only a matter of time
before I prove it.

18:11.013 --> 18:14.014
But, uh, listen,
that's not why I'm here.

18:14.016 --> 18:15.348
I need your help, Jerry.

18:15.350 --> 18:16.766
A little girl was abducted
this morning

18:16.768 --> 18:18.101
from a hula recital.

18:18.103 --> 18:19.386
Yeah, whatever I can do.

18:19.388 --> 18:21.187
Of course,
my expertise in abduction

18:21.189 --> 18:22.772
is more of
the extraterrestrial variety,

18:22.774 --> 18:24.858
but, uh, hit me.

18:24.860 --> 18:26.393
Well, we confiscated
all the cell phones

18:26.395 --> 18:27.861
and the camcorders
from the parents,

18:27.863 --> 18:29.529
hoping we'd get an image
of the kidnapper,

18:29.531 --> 18:32.115
but now we've got hours and
hours of footage to go through,

18:32.117 --> 18:33.867
and I've got every available HPD
on the ground

18:33.869 --> 18:34.901
looking for the kid.

18:34.903 --> 18:36.286
So you want me to comb
through the footage.

18:36.288 --> 18:38.071
You got the time?

18:38.073 --> 18:40.957
Yeah, the agent's not showing
the place again till tomorrow.

19:04.349 --> 19:05.765
(knocking on door)

19:05.767 --> 19:07.100
KONO:
Relax. Act normal.

19:07.102 --> 19:08.318
Someone may be watching.

19:08.320 --> 19:09.519
Good.

19:09.521 --> 19:10.987
Now sign for the package.

19:15.944 --> 19:18.111
Bring it straight
to Steve McGarrett.

19:18.113 --> 19:20.413
Now thank me
and head back inside.

19:20.415 --> 19:22.582
Thank you.

19:31.293 --> 19:33.793
DANNY: <i>So, have you received</i>
<i>any threats recently?</i>

19:33.795 --> 19:34.878
No.

19:34.880 --> 19:35.962
What about work?

19:35.964 --> 19:37.197
Any trouble at work?

19:37.199 --> 19:39.215
Commander,
we make children's products--

19:39.217 --> 19:42.802
strollers, car seats,
highchairs, that sort of thing.

19:42.804 --> 19:44.804
Everyone in our company
is like family.

19:44.806 --> 19:47.286
I mean, the only thing we argue
about is where to go for lunch.

19:48.360 --> 19:50.443
Sorry.
She said to give you this.

19:50.445 --> 19:52.112
Great. Thank you.

19:52.114 --> 19:53.730
All right.

19:53.732 --> 19:56.316
Here's what happens next.

19:56.318 --> 19:58.201
When the kidnapper calls back,

19:58.203 --> 20:00.070
we're gonna run a trace.

20:00.072 --> 20:03.206
Now, he spoke to you last time,
Eric, so you're gonna

20:03.208 --> 20:05.158
talk to him; you need
to keep him on the line

20:05.160 --> 20:07.660
as long as possible, okay?

20:07.662 --> 20:09.829
What am I supposed to say?
He's gonna ask you

20:09.831 --> 20:11.164
if you have his money.
You're gonna tell him

20:11.166 --> 20:12.215
you're in the process
of getting it,

20:12.217 --> 20:13.383
but before you can go
any further,

20:13.385 --> 20:14.385
you need proof of life.

20:14.386 --> 20:16.169
Angela Larkin is
on her way over right now

20:16.171 --> 20:17.504
to verify Sophie's voice.

20:17.506 --> 20:19.839
All right, once she confirms
it's Sophie, you go along

20:19.841 --> 20:22.175
with what he says, tell him
you're gonna give him the money.

20:22.177 --> 20:23.643
Okay.

20:23.645 --> 20:25.678
All right,
call's in a couple of minutes.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.897
(sighs)

20:38.610 --> 20:39.659
Hey.

20:39.661 --> 20:41.027
You okay?

20:41.029 --> 20:43.029
(sighs)
Not really.

20:43.031 --> 20:44.948
Hey, look, um,
I have a daughter.

20:44.950 --> 20:46.116
All right?

20:46.118 --> 20:47.250
Her name is Grace.

20:47.252 --> 20:48.785
She's just a little bit
older than Maggie.

20:48.787 --> 20:50.537
Um, if you're anything like me,
I know there's nothing

20:50.539 --> 20:51.871
you wouldn't do to protect
your kid, right?

20:51.873 --> 20:53.757
Yeah, but what if
I screw up or...

20:53.759 --> 20:55.125
you know,
say the wrong thing or...

20:55.127 --> 20:56.176
You're not gonna screw up.

20:56.178 --> 20:58.762
Okay? Look,
I know that you are scared,

20:58.764 --> 21:01.214
but I'm telling you,
if this was your daughter,

21:01.216 --> 21:02.632
you would put
all that fear aside

21:02.634 --> 21:04.801
and do whatever you had to do
to protect her, right?

21:04.803 --> 21:06.719
So it's easy.
You just stick to the script.

21:06.721 --> 21:08.271
We got your back.
We're right here.

21:08.273 --> 21:09.606
It's gonna be fine, all right?

21:09.608 --> 21:11.057
(sighing):
Okay.

21:11.059 --> 21:12.192
All right, good.

21:12.194 --> 21:13.860
(phone rings)

21:13.862 --> 21:15.195
All right, Eric, Eric.

21:16.064 --> 21:17.897
You ready?

21:17.899 --> 21:19.065
Yeah.

21:19.067 --> 21:20.617
(ringing continues)

21:22.454 --> 21:24.154
Hello?

21:24.156 --> 21:25.905
MAN: Do you have the money,
Mr. Porter?

21:25.907 --> 21:28.625
Yeah, I'm getting it,
but first I need to know

21:28.627 --> 21:30.326
that Maggie's okay.

21:30.328 --> 21:32.962
Let me speak to her.

21:40.922 --> 21:42.055
Say hello.

21:42.057 --> 21:43.139
Mommy?

21:43.141 --> 21:45.592
Mommy, I want to come home.

21:45.594 --> 21:47.977
MAN:
She's okay for now.

21:47.979 --> 21:49.929
Where's the money?

21:49.931 --> 21:52.148
I'm getting it, but it-it's
gonna take a couple hours

21:52.150 --> 21:53.516
to raise that amount in cash.

21:53.518 --> 21:54.851
So please,

21:54.853 --> 21:56.686
please don't hurt her.

21:56.688 --> 21:57.937
Two hours.

21:57.939 --> 21:59.072
Not a minute more.

21:59.074 --> 22:00.273
Once you have the money,

22:00.275 --> 22:02.775
I'll give you the location
where to bring it.

22:02.777 --> 22:05.695
Don't test my resolve,
Mr. Porter.

22:05.697 --> 22:06.946
I will kill her.

22:06.948 --> 22:08.781
Do you understand?
Yes.

22:08.783 --> 22:11.117
Good.
(click, dial tone)

22:11.119 --> 22:13.169
Did it work?

22:13.171 --> 22:15.922
He's using a burner phone,
so it's impossible

22:15.924 --> 22:19.209
to get an exact address. We got
nothing on voice recognition.

22:21.129 --> 22:23.513
Okay, uh, $1.6 million

22:23.515 --> 22:25.465
is a very specific number.

22:25.467 --> 22:27.684
Does that mean anything
to you guys?

22:27.686 --> 22:29.636
No. No.
No, not to me.

22:29.638 --> 22:32.305
DANNY: That's a lot of money, uh,
to get in a couple hours.

22:32.307 --> 22:33.773
Even with the governor's help.

22:39.481 --> 22:42.198
We... We'll get
you the money.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.366
I just need
to make some calls.

22:43.368 --> 22:44.817
(sighs with relief)

22:44.819 --> 22:47.153
Thank you, both.

22:47.155 --> 22:48.705
So much.

22:49.457 --> 22:51.207
Hang in there, okay?

22:51.209 --> 22:54.460
We're gonna
get Sophie back.

22:57.048 --> 22:58.915
What is it?

22:58.917 --> 23:01.801
Okay, the Porters
are worth $50 million, right?

23:01.803 --> 23:03.253
The kidnapper thinks

23:03.255 --> 23:06.256
that he has their only kid and
he asks for $1.6 million. Why?

23:06.258 --> 23:07.724
Why so little?

23:11.846 --> 23:13.596
Hey, brah,
get over here.

23:13.598 --> 23:14.847
What, did you
find something?

23:14.849 --> 23:16.566
You know it.

23:16.568 --> 23:18.401
This was taken
outside the school

23:18.403 --> 23:19.569
before the recital
started.

23:19.571 --> 23:20.737
Behind the hula girl.

23:20.739 --> 23:22.121
Silver Beemer.
Check him out.

23:22.123 --> 23:23.139
CHIN:
Blue baseball cap.

23:23.141 --> 23:24.607
Matches the witness description.

23:24.609 --> 23:25.742
Mm!

23:25.744 --> 23:28.077
I am like a rabbit's foot,
aren't I?

23:28.079 --> 23:30.363
You are definitely
a good luck charm.

23:30.365 --> 23:31.581
Now slide over.

23:36.371 --> 23:37.670
JERRY:
Facial recognition.

23:37.672 --> 23:39.422
Total violation of our
First Amendment rights.

23:39.424 --> 23:40.456
Cool.

23:40.458 --> 23:44.427
Ooh, I also got
a partial license plate.

23:45.630 --> 23:47.847
CHIN:
Six-Z-A-E.

23:47.849 --> 23:50.016
All right, well, that along
with the make and a color

23:50.018 --> 23:51.551
ought to be enough
to get us a match.

23:51.553 --> 23:53.720
Let's see.

23:53.722 --> 23:55.305
And there it is.

23:55.307 --> 23:56.773
Reported stolen
this morning.

23:56.775 --> 23:59.459
HPD already found it
abandoned in Chinatown.

23:59.461 --> 24:01.044
Hey, there we go.

24:01.046 --> 24:03.313
Assault, burglary,
weapons possession.

24:03.315 --> 24:05.531
Just paroled out of Halawa
six months ago.

24:10.238 --> 24:12.021
(tires screech)

24:13.241 --> 24:14.490
Michael Wiley,

24:14.492 --> 24:16.576
get out of the vehicle.
Keep your hands

24:16.578 --> 24:17.744
where we can
see them.

24:17.746 --> 24:20.463
Out of the car.
Right now, let's go.

24:22.584 --> 24:24.200
Nice and slow.

24:25.637 --> 24:26.803
(groans)

24:31.309 --> 24:33.259
DANNY:
He's dead. Come on.

24:36.431 --> 24:37.263
Sophie?

24:37.265 --> 24:38.247
DANNY:
Sophie? Sophie?

24:38.249 --> 24:41.517
STEVE:
Sophie? Sophie?

24:47.859 --> 24:48.859
Sophie?

24:56.167 --> 24:57.333
Danny...

25:01.172 --> 25:02.789
She was here.

25:14.706 --> 25:16.422
All right,
this doesn't make sense.

25:16.424 --> 25:18.207
Wiley was expecting
a pay day.

25:18.209 --> 25:19.842
There's no way he'd let
Sophie out of his sight

25:19.844 --> 25:21.093
before he cashed in.

25:21.095 --> 25:22.378
DANNY: Unless he realized
he had the wrong girl

25:22.380 --> 25:23.462
and decided to
cut his losses.

25:23.464 --> 25:24.714
I just got off the phone

25:24.716 --> 25:25.798
with the Porters.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.216
I sent them a photo of Wiley.

25:27.218 --> 25:28.384
They don't recognize him.
STEVE: Keep digging.

25:28.386 --> 25:29.852
There's got to be
a connection.

25:29.854 --> 25:31.387
CHIN: He's definitely the one
calling them, though.

25:31.389 --> 25:32.638
CSU recovered
his burner phone.

25:32.640 --> 25:34.273
And on that phone,
over the past few hours,

25:34.275 --> 25:36.108
there are two outgoing
calls to the Porters,

25:36.110 --> 25:38.194
as well as
multiple calls

25:38.196 --> 25:40.646
going in and out to
a second burner phone.

25:40.648 --> 25:42.648
CSU's still looking for that
phone, but it was turned off.

25:42.650 --> 25:43.532
DANNY:
Aha, all right.

25:43.534 --> 25:44.784
So Wiley's got a partner.

25:44.786 --> 25:46.318
Whoever that is has Sophie.

25:46.320 --> 25:48.654
The kidnapper's gonna call back
in half an hour

25:48.656 --> 25:49.705
with the location of the drop.

25:49.707 --> 25:51.073
I'm thinking,
since Wiley

25:51.075 --> 25:52.241
did not have
Sophie with him,

25:52.243 --> 25:53.576
he was headed to
pick up that money.

25:53.578 --> 25:54.994
Which means his partner
was the one

25:54.996 --> 25:56.662
who was gonna make that call.

25:56.664 --> 25:58.748
Well, and as far as the partner's
concerned, everything is still a go.

25:58.750 --> 26:01.083
CHIN: If Wiley's partner tries
to get in touch with him,

26:01.085 --> 26:02.635
he's going to know
that something's wrong.

26:02.637 --> 26:04.920
He's liable to panic
and then kill Sophie.

26:04.922 --> 26:07.173
That's why we keep
what happened here quiet.

26:09.143 --> 26:10.276
Oh.

26:10.278 --> 26:12.261
Thanks, Jerry.
Look, I appreciate your help,

26:12.263 --> 26:14.263
but you really didn't
have to stick around.

26:14.265 --> 26:16.148
Are you kidding?
Research is my super power.

26:16.150 --> 26:17.850
Oh, by the way,

26:17.852 --> 26:19.618
I'm pretty sure I broke
Captain America's printer.

26:19.620 --> 26:21.153
Also pretty sure
he never used it.

26:21.155 --> 26:22.104
Found it under a plant.

26:22.106 --> 26:24.573
Captain America?
Yeah.

26:24.575 --> 26:25.741
That's my little nickname
for McGarrett.

26:25.743 --> 26:27.827
(laughs)
I like it.

26:27.829 --> 26:29.195
Okay, so did you
find anything?

26:29.197 --> 26:30.863
You said we were looking
for a connection

26:30.865 --> 26:32.565
between the Porters
and the ransom demand.

26:32.567 --> 26:33.532
Mm-hmm.

26:33.534 --> 26:35.618
Well, here is
a $1.6 million

26:35.620 --> 26:37.953
severance package paid
by the Porters' company

26:37.955 --> 26:40.956
to an employee
named Alan Pollard.

26:40.958 --> 26:42.458
Let me look at that.

26:42.460 --> 26:44.126
JERRY:
Pollard was the lead engineer

26:44.128 --> 26:45.177
at the Porters' company

26:45.179 --> 26:46.629
up until two years ago.

26:46.631 --> 26:48.047
He designed
an energy-absorbing foam

26:48.049 --> 26:50.633
which revolutionized
car seat safety,

26:50.635 --> 26:51.767
put the Porters on the map.

26:51.769 --> 26:53.469
A month
before the IPO,

26:53.471 --> 26:55.387
he just suddenly
left the company.

26:55.389 --> 26:56.555
It doesn't say here why.

26:56.557 --> 26:59.642
And that's because
Pollard signed

26:59.644 --> 27:01.644
a confidentiality agreement.

27:01.646 --> 27:03.145
Which,
in my experience,

27:03.147 --> 27:05.314
tells me that he was paid
to keep quiet.

27:05.316 --> 27:06.482
What experience?

27:06.484 --> 27:09.235
It doesn't matter.

27:11.322 --> 27:12.371
Are you okay?

27:12.373 --> 27:14.156
Yeah. I'm great.

27:15.126 --> 27:16.375
Look, I'm just saying

27:16.377 --> 27:17.576
that this was a corporate
cover-up. Trust me.

27:17.578 --> 27:19.461
Okay.

27:19.463 --> 27:20.996
All right,
so Pollard's forced out

27:20.998 --> 27:22.164
before the company
hits it big.

27:22.166 --> 27:24.834
Which means he missed
out on a huge pay day.

27:24.836 --> 27:26.418
Looks like he
found a way

27:26.420 --> 27:27.803
to make up for his losses.

27:27.805 --> 27:29.505
What-what if we do it
the other way? What if I...

27:29.507 --> 27:31.173
Alan Pollard!

27:31.175 --> 27:32.380
Drop the cell phone, put
your hands on your head!

27:32.404 --> 27:33.293
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

27:33.294 --> 27:35.060
Shut your mouth, turn around,
interlock your fingers!

27:35.062 --> 27:36.178
Turn around!

27:36.180 --> 27:38.013
Go ahead, I got him.

27:39.984 --> 27:41.066
Sophie!

27:41.068 --> 27:42.818
Sophie!

27:42.820 --> 27:43.986
Where's Sophie?
GROVER: Can you hear me? Sophie!

27:43.988 --> 27:45.855
Where's Sophie?
I don't know what

27:45.857 --> 27:47.673
you're talking about.
No?

27:47.675 --> 27:48.691
Boat's clear.

27:48.693 --> 27:49.742
No sign of the girl.

27:49.744 --> 27:52.111
Let's talk.

27:54.081 --> 27:55.698
STEVE:
<i>Yeah, roger that.</i>

27:55.700 --> 27:57.032
We're on the way.
No, no, no, Duke, please,

27:57.034 --> 27:58.083
you did everything
you could

27:58.085 --> 28:00.369
and I appreciate it, all right?

28:00.371 --> 28:01.704
All right. Thanks, buddy.

28:01.706 --> 28:03.956
Marco Reyes?
Yeah.

28:03.958 --> 28:05.040
His lawyer showed up,

28:05.042 --> 28:06.375
arranged for bail.

28:06.377 --> 28:07.793
So he'll be out
in a couple of days.

28:07.795 --> 28:09.345
What are you going to do?

28:09.347 --> 28:10.379
I am gonna give him

28:10.381 --> 28:12.548
a ride to the airport.
What did Chin say?

28:12.550 --> 28:15.017
Sophie wasn't on Pollard's boat.
Doesn't mean he's not involved.

28:15.019 --> 28:16.769
Right. Chin and Grover
are pressing him now.

28:16.771 --> 28:18.053
We need to do the same
with the Porters,

28:18.055 --> 28:20.723
when Angela
is not around.

28:20.725 --> 28:21.974
I'm telling you,

28:21.976 --> 28:23.392
there's no way Alan
could be involved.

28:23.394 --> 28:24.727
Why didn't you
tell us about him

28:24.729 --> 28:25.778
when you heard
the amount?

28:25.780 --> 28:26.946
I mean, you had to
know your company

28:26.948 --> 28:30.733
paid him $1.6 million
when he left.

28:30.735 --> 28:32.067
Alan was with us
from the very beginning.

28:32.069 --> 28:33.202
When he decided to leave,

28:33.204 --> 28:34.536
we cashed out his shares.
That was...

28:34.538 --> 28:36.705
two years ago.
We didn't remember the amount.

28:36.707 --> 28:38.574
And you made him sign
a confidentiality agreement.

28:38.576 --> 28:39.658
Why?

28:39.660 --> 28:41.076
It was a standard
non-compete clause.

28:41.078 --> 28:42.745
Our attorney
insists everyone

28:42.747 --> 28:44.246
leaving the company sign one.

28:44.248 --> 28:45.915
Look, we wouldn't
deliberately

28:45.917 --> 28:48.250
withhold information
from you.

28:48.252 --> 28:49.668
We have nothing to hide.

28:49.670 --> 28:51.303
Like I said,

28:51.305 --> 28:52.922
I got my problems
with the Porters,

28:52.924 --> 28:54.256
but I would never
kidnap their daughter.

28:54.258 --> 28:55.891
You mean the
problem where they

28:55.893 --> 28:57.009
bought you out for $1.6 million,

28:57.011 --> 28:59.678
but the company
ended up going public

28:59.680 --> 29:01.180
a month later,
costing you twice as much?

29:01.182 --> 29:02.147
No, man.

29:02.149 --> 29:04.566
My issues with
the Porters are more, uh,

29:04.568 --> 29:06.435
spiritual than financial.

29:06.437 --> 29:07.903
Well, if you feel like
confessing something,

29:07.905 --> 29:09.438
now would
be the time.

29:09.440 --> 29:12.191
We got a little girl's
life at stake.

29:15.446 --> 29:18.280
Two years ago,
we crash tested a new car seat.

29:18.282 --> 29:22.868
That's when I discovered
a defect in my design.

29:22.870 --> 29:24.870
There was an incident
where a latch strap

29:24.872 --> 29:26.338
came loose from the anchor

29:26.340 --> 29:28.540
during a high-impact
collision demo.

29:29.593 --> 29:31.460
It only happened once
in 100 tests.

29:31.462 --> 29:33.595
But I wrote a memo

29:33.597 --> 29:34.797
detailing my findings.

29:34.799 --> 29:37.599
Recommended we hold off
on releasing the first order

29:37.601 --> 29:39.969
of 50,000 seats until
we figured out what happened.

29:39.971 --> 29:41.353
CHIN:
I take it the Porters

29:41.355 --> 29:43.305
didn't respond too well
to that memo.

29:43.307 --> 29:46.141
I was told my findings didn't
warrant such drastic measures.

29:46.143 --> 29:48.644
That, uh, pushing
the delivery date

29:48.646 --> 29:49.979
would cost the company millions

29:49.981 --> 29:52.648
and they'd have to lay off
a bunch of employees.

29:52.650 --> 29:53.966
They had a deal
in place

29:53.968 --> 29:55.367
with a major chain.

29:55.369 --> 29:57.152
And if we didn't meet
our delivery date,

29:57.154 --> 29:59.038
they'd take their
business elsewhere.

29:59.040 --> 30:02.241
Since the test
only happened once,

30:02.243 --> 30:05.210
the company deemed the defect
was human error.

30:05.212 --> 30:08.213
And you shipped those car seats
anyway, didn't you?

30:08.215 --> 30:10.299
They convinced me
it was possible

30:10.301 --> 30:11.517
they were right and I was wrong.

30:11.519 --> 30:14.053
All I could do was fix
the problem moving forward

30:14.055 --> 30:16.839
and hope to God
nothing happened.

30:16.841 --> 30:18.841
Something did
happen, didn't it?

30:26.100 --> 30:28.017
There was an accident.

30:39.914 --> 30:42.364
A driver lost control.

30:42.366 --> 30:44.533
Crashed on the 93.

30:45.586 --> 30:48.253
His two-year-old daughter
was in the back seat.

30:53.010 --> 30:55.210
She was killed on impact.

31:16.734 --> 31:18.283
(phone ringing)

31:18.285 --> 31:20.202
Eric... keep it simple.

31:20.204 --> 31:22.571
You got the money,
you're ready to make a trade.

31:22.573 --> 31:23.573
Okay, you good?

31:23.574 --> 31:24.907
Okay.
STEVE: All right.

31:24.909 --> 31:26.575
Hello?

31:26.577 --> 31:28.794
MAN:
I told you no cops, Mr. Porter.

31:28.796 --> 31:29.912
You didn't listen.

31:29.914 --> 31:30.879
ERIC:
I have your money.

31:30.881 --> 31:31.797
Just tell me where to meet you.

31:31.799 --> 31:32.915
Shut up!
We're done talking.

31:32.917 --> 31:35.918
Now hand the phone
over to the cops.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.386
There are
no cops here.

31:37.388 --> 31:39.922
Tell them to get
on the phone right now

31:39.924 --> 31:41.590
or I kill her.

31:41.592 --> 31:43.008
This is McGarrett with Five-O.

31:43.010 --> 31:44.226
Where is Michael Wiley?

31:44.228 --> 31:45.644
I don't know anything about him.

31:45.646 --> 31:46.895
You're lying.
He was supposed

31:46.897 --> 31:48.230
to be here for the call

31:48.232 --> 31:49.264
and he never showed up.

31:49.266 --> 31:50.732
He wouldn't walk away from this,

31:50.734 --> 31:52.734
which means you have him.

31:52.736 --> 31:53.902
The Porters have done
everything you asked.

31:53.904 --> 31:55.154
We have your money.

31:55.156 --> 31:56.271
We just want
their daughter back.

31:56.273 --> 31:57.773
Let's stick to the plan.

31:57.775 --> 31:59.158
I have a new plan.

31:59.160 --> 32:01.276
Mrs. Porter's gonna
deliver the money.

32:01.278 --> 32:03.662
And if I even sense
the police are nearby...

32:03.664 --> 32:06.782
There's no way we're gonna let
Mrs. Porter go in alone, okay?

32:06.784 --> 32:07.950
I will deliver the money.

32:07.952 --> 32:09.952
You're not listening to me.

32:09.954 --> 32:12.454
Send the wife or this ends now.

32:20.514 --> 32:21.964
Okay.

32:21.966 --> 32:23.465
Manana Trail.

32:23.467 --> 32:24.633
30 minutes.

32:24.635 --> 32:27.136
Once I have the money,
I'll give you

32:27.138 --> 32:28.437
the girl's location.
No, no, no.

32:28.439 --> 32:30.189
We're not handing
over the money

32:30.191 --> 32:32.357
unless Maggie is there.

32:33.644 --> 32:35.561
You don't have a choice.

32:35.563 --> 32:37.896
(hangs up)

32:39.033 --> 32:40.649
All right, so it's just
like we talked about.

32:40.651 --> 32:42.034
You drop the duffle bag
off at the location,

32:42.036 --> 32:43.452
get back in your car,
come back home.

32:43.454 --> 32:44.486
That's it.

32:44.488 --> 32:46.488
Look, we-we all want
to get Sophie back,

32:46.490 --> 32:48.040
but I-I can't let
my wife do this.

32:48.042 --> 32:50.159
It's not safe,
sending her out there alone.

32:50.161 --> 32:52.327
Eric, there's
no other way.

32:52.329 --> 32:54.580
I'm going
to be fine.

32:54.582 --> 32:56.582
STEVE: Eric, she's not going
to be alone, okay?

32:56.584 --> 32:57.666
We're gonna
be watching her

32:57.668 --> 32:58.667
on a surveillance
satellite the entire time.

32:58.669 --> 32:59.718
That means eyes on
the drop location.

32:59.720 --> 33:02.721
As soon as the kidnapper
gets the cash,

33:02.723 --> 33:04.923
he's gonna lead
us to Sophie.

33:12.016 --> 33:14.016
I'll be fine.

33:14.018 --> 33:16.101
Promise.

33:18.522 --> 33:19.855
POLLARD:
<i>After the accident,</i>

33:19.857 --> 33:20.906
investigators said

33:20.908 --> 33:22.524
the little girl died
because the father

33:22.526 --> 33:24.693
failed to properly install
her car seat,

33:24.695 --> 33:27.829
but he swore
he fastened it correctly.

33:54.725 --> 33:57.025
♪ ♪

34:00.948 --> 34:02.481
(no voice)

34:03.901 --> 34:06.201
You knew he was
telling the truth!

34:09.206 --> 34:10.739
The parents
of the little girl sued,

34:10.741 --> 34:12.708
but there was no evidence
the seat was faulty.

34:12.710 --> 34:15.210
GROVER: Yeah,
the Porters made sure of that

34:15.212 --> 34:16.745
by paying you off, didn't they?

34:16.746 --> 34:18.163
I wanted to come forward,

34:18.165 --> 34:21.250
but the crash test data,
along with my memo,

34:21.252 --> 34:22.301
were destroyed.

34:22.303 --> 34:24.303
The company's lawyers
told me

34:24.304 --> 34:25.754
if I said anything,

34:25.755 --> 34:28.257
they would deny that
I warned them about the defect.

34:28.259 --> 34:29.641
That I would be
criminally liable.

34:29.643 --> 34:31.476
They gave me a choice.

34:31.478 --> 34:33.929
Accept the payout or go to jail.

34:33.931 --> 34:35.147
You wanted

34:35.149 --> 34:36.732
to come forward?

34:36.734 --> 34:38.100
You realize

34:38.101 --> 34:39.935
those faulty car seats
are still out there

34:39.937 --> 34:41.069
with children in them.

34:41.071 --> 34:43.237
I fixed the defect
on the next shipment.

34:43.239 --> 34:46.074
There hasn't been
another incident.

34:46.076 --> 34:48.110
I never touched that money.

34:49.079 --> 34:50.661
There isn't a day that goes by

34:50.664 --> 34:53.282
I don't regret what I did.

34:53.284 --> 34:55.199
Let me ask you something.

34:55.202 --> 34:57.669
During the litigation,
did the girl's parents

34:57.671 --> 34:59.621
ever find out that
you were paid off?

34:59.623 --> 35:01.123
No.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.293
But I told the father.

35:05.462 --> 35:06.795
Three weeks ago,

35:06.797 --> 35:08.597
I came across
his wife's obituary

35:08.599 --> 35:10.632
in the <i> Advertiser.</i>

35:10.634 --> 35:11.967
She died of cancer

35:11.969 --> 35:13.935
without ever...

35:13.937 --> 35:16.521
knowing the truth
about her daughter.

35:18.359 --> 35:20.392
I reached out
to her husband,

35:20.394 --> 35:22.277
confessed everything,

35:22.279 --> 35:25.530
even offered him the 1.6 million
the Porters gave me.

35:25.532 --> 35:26.982
But he didn't want it.

35:26.984 --> 35:29.735
Said it wouldn't bring back
his daughter.

35:30.537 --> 35:31.953
Listen, man.

35:32.656 --> 35:34.323
If I ever lost my kid that way,

35:34.325 --> 35:36.408
it would haunt me
for the rest of my life.

35:37.911 --> 35:41.413
We need his name, Alan.

35:42.216 --> 35:44.750
Jason Hollier.

35:44.752 --> 35:46.418
This was never
about the money.

35:46.420 --> 35:48.837
This guy's looking for revenge.

36:13.914 --> 36:15.247
Where the hell is this guy?

36:15.249 --> 36:17.115
(phone ringing)

36:17.117 --> 36:18.283
Chin, what's up?

36:18.285 --> 36:20.252
Steve, we've got an I.D.
on the kidnapper.

36:20.254 --> 36:22.003
His name is Jason Hollier.

36:22.005 --> 36:24.373
His daughter died
in a car accident on the H93

36:24.375 --> 36:25.757
when her car seat malfunctioned,

36:25.759 --> 36:28.126
and that car seat was
manufactured by the Porters.

36:28.128 --> 36:29.878
GROVER:
Get this.

36:29.880 --> 36:31.263
His wife's maiden name is Wiley.

36:31.265 --> 36:32.931
Our dead kidnapper,
Michael Wiley,

36:32.933 --> 36:34.433
that was her brother.

36:34.435 --> 36:35.717
STEVE:
Call HPD.

36:35.719 --> 36:37.436
Get them over
to Hollier's house right now.

36:37.438 --> 36:38.854
Okay, there's one more thing,
Steve.

36:38.856 --> 36:40.222
According to Pollard,

36:40.224 --> 36:42.557
Caroline Porter
covered up evidence

36:42.559 --> 36:45.527
and paid him off
to avoid a trial.

36:49.400 --> 36:50.649
You didn't know.

36:50.651 --> 36:52.401
Huh? No.

36:52.403 --> 36:54.152
That's why they wanted Caroline
to bring the money.

36:54.154 --> 36:55.404
STEVE:
Yeah, this is all a setup.

36:55.406 --> 36:57.622
<i>They're going after her.</i>

36:57.624 --> 37:00.292
Caroline, you gotta
get out of there.

37:00.294 --> 37:01.660
He's coming after you.

37:05.666 --> 37:08.383
Get in.

37:08.385 --> 37:09.718
Now!
Okay! Okay.

37:09.720 --> 37:11.586
Okay.

37:20.559 --> 37:22.439
DANNY: <i>Okay, I got a lock</i>
<i>on her phone signal.</i>

37:22.506 --> 37:23.588
Where's he taking her?

37:23.590 --> 37:25.424
They're headed north
on Old Pali Road.

37:25.426 --> 37:26.675
If Hollier wants
to kill Caroline,

37:26.677 --> 37:28.293
why's he taking her hostage?

37:28.295 --> 37:30.178
He blames her
for his daughter's death.

37:30.180 --> 37:31.346
So maybe he's got
a couple of things

37:31.348 --> 37:33.098
he wants to get off his chest
before he kills her.

37:33.100 --> 37:34.182
Chin said Hollier's daughter

37:34.184 --> 37:35.434
died on H93, right?

37:35.436 --> 37:36.885
That's right, why?

37:36.887 --> 37:38.603
That's where he's going.
Call Kono.

37:38.605 --> 37:40.555
We got to know exactly where
that accident happened.

37:40.557 --> 37:42.891
We find them, we find Sophie.

37:44.194 --> 37:46.228
That little girl you took,

37:46.230 --> 37:48.230
she's not my daughter.
I know.

37:48.232 --> 37:51.316
My brother-in-law
grabbed the wrong girl,

37:51.318 --> 37:53.235
but it didn't matter.

37:53.237 --> 37:56.822
I knew as soon you heard
1.6 million,

37:56.824 --> 37:57.956
you'd do whatever I said

37:57.958 --> 37:59.408
before you'd admit
to killing my daughter.

37:59.410 --> 38:01.793
You have to believe me, I never
meant for that to happen.

38:01.795 --> 38:03.078
But it did.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.329
(sniffles)

38:04.331 --> 38:05.497
And you could've stopped it.

38:05.499 --> 38:07.499
(crying)

38:07.501 --> 38:09.551
The little girl,

38:09.553 --> 38:10.635
what did you do to her?

38:10.637 --> 38:11.887
She had nothing
to do with this.

38:11.889 --> 38:14.139
I know that.

38:14.141 --> 38:17.759
I wanted to take your girl
so you could feel what it's like

38:17.761 --> 38:19.911
to lose a child.

38:23.434 --> 38:24.816
<i>Pull over.</i>

38:24.818 --> 38:26.852
Pull over here!

38:27.988 --> 38:30.322
<i>It never leaves me.</i>

38:30.324 --> 38:32.774
<i>What happened here.</i>

38:32.776 --> 38:34.893
<i>I relive it every single day.</i>

38:45.622 --> 38:47.873
<i>(tires squealing)</i>

38:51.378 --> 38:52.928
<i>After the crash,</i>

38:52.930 --> 38:54.679
<i>I called out to Olivia.</i>

38:54.681 --> 38:56.832
Olivia!

38:58.352 --> 38:59.801
But she didn't answer.

38:59.803 --> 39:00.969
(sighs)

39:00.971 --> 39:04.022
The report said on impact,
the seat came loose.

39:04.024 --> 39:07.859
The force was so strong
it broke her neck.

39:07.861 --> 39:10.278
I am so sorry.

39:10.280 --> 39:11.897
They said it was my fault.

39:11.899 --> 39:14.065
That I didn't lock her in right.

39:14.067 --> 39:16.318
You killed my daughter.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.487
You did!
I'm sorry.

39:18.489 --> 39:19.788
Get out.

39:19.790 --> 39:21.289
Please.

39:21.291 --> 39:22.707
I'm not gonna ask you again.

39:24.161 --> 39:27.295
Okay. Okay.

39:32.836 --> 39:34.002
Keep walking.

39:34.004 --> 39:35.337
Okay!

39:35.339 --> 39:37.472
There.

39:37.474 --> 39:39.224
Now turn around.

39:48.352 --> 39:49.818
Please don't.

39:49.820 --> 39:51.236
Please don't do this.

40:03.450 --> 40:05.250
(sirens wailing)

40:05.252 --> 40:06.837
(tires squealing)

40:06.837 --> 40:08.203
STEVE:
Drop the weapon.

40:08.205 --> 40:09.872
Drop the weapon, Jason.

40:09.874 --> 40:12.257
You got to drop that weapon
right now.

40:12.259 --> 40:13.542
We know about the accident.

40:13.544 --> 40:14.593
We know it wasn't your fault.

40:14.595 --> 40:16.295
You got to drop that weapon
right now.

40:21.052 --> 40:24.386
Do you have any idea how it
feels to lose someone you love?

40:24.388 --> 40:26.138
To live with the guilt

40:26.140 --> 40:27.389
that it's your fault?

40:27.391 --> 40:30.392
No, I can't imagine
what that must feel like.

40:31.729 --> 40:34.279
No, you can't.

40:34.281 --> 40:35.898
Listen, no parent should

40:35.900 --> 40:37.232
have to go through
what you went through.

40:37.234 --> 40:39.401
What do I have to live for?

40:39.403 --> 40:40.786
Listen to me, there's a family
out there right now

40:40.788 --> 40:42.071
and they want to see
their daughter.

40:42.073 --> 40:43.572
I know you don't want to put
them through the pain

40:43.574 --> 40:44.573
of having to bury that kid.

40:44.575 --> 40:46.792
I know that's not what
you want, right?

40:46.794 --> 40:49.578
I just want my little girl back.

40:49.580 --> 40:51.497
I know you do, okay?

40:51.499 --> 40:53.582
And I wish I could
give you that, but I can't.

40:53.584 --> 40:55.634
Look at me, buddy,
you made your point today.

40:55.636 --> 40:58.754
Okay? What happened with Olivia,
after she died, it was wrong.

41:00.674 --> 41:02.925
Okay? But this is over now.

41:02.927 --> 41:04.643
This has to stop.
Put down the gun.

41:04.645 --> 41:05.761
Tell us where Sophie is.

41:05.763 --> 41:06.979
It's the right thing to do.

41:06.981 --> 41:08.263
Let's go. Come on.

41:23.831 --> 41:26.331
Good, relax.

41:29.120 --> 41:30.786
Good news is you're all right.

41:30.788 --> 41:33.172
Bad news is
you're gonna need a lawyer.

41:35.459 --> 41:37.126
(crying, sniffling)

41:37.128 --> 41:40.846
Please tell that little girl
I'm so sorry.

41:40.848 --> 41:43.465
Where is she?

41:58.315 --> 41:59.698
Mommy!

42:08.242 --> 42:10.492
♪ ♪

42:36.904 --> 42:39.905
♪ ♪

42:59.293 --> 43:00.959
Do you have my money?

43:00.961 --> 43:03.395
Look, I strongly suggest

43:03.397 --> 43:05.464
that you just get on a plane
and never come back.

43:05.466 --> 43:08.300
As soon as I get my money,
that's exactly what I'll do.

43:08.302 --> 43:09.518
I don't have your money.

43:09.520 --> 43:10.769
I don't know how many times
I got to tell you

43:10.771 --> 43:12.304
I don't know where it is.
I don't have it.

43:12.306 --> 43:14.223
That's the funny thing
because Matthew

43:14.225 --> 43:15.274
tells a very different story.

43:15.276 --> 43:16.558
Of course, people tend

43:16.560 --> 43:19.361
to say anything when they have
a gun to their head.

43:21.365 --> 43:23.315
Where is he?

43:23.317 --> 43:25.067
You got my brother?
Where is he? Huh?

43:25.069 --> 43:28.203
Someplace you'll never find him.

43:28.205 --> 43:30.072
Unless I get my money.
