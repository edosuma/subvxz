00:01.169 --> 00:03.037
She's coming in hot.
She's The Mick.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.173
-Yaah!
-I just built that.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.407
It didn't take.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
And check out our other Fox
programs-- Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
The Last Man on Earth and
Ghosted.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.548
I don't really know how
to do any of this stuff.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.721
(cooing)

00:23.691 --> 00:25.926
(pigeons cooing)

00:25.959 --> 00:29.497
Damn it, Chip! You forgot
to bring him in last night.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.032
-Shoo! Get out of here!
-Be gone! Be gone!

00:32.066 --> 00:33.501
-Shoo!
-Go.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.369
You're the one
who wheeled him out here.

00:35.403 --> 00:37.438
Yeah, well, I can't have him
watching me eat.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.940
His skin looks like oatmeal.
It's disgusting.

00:39.973 --> 00:41.909
What the hell'd
you guys do the colonel?

00:41.942 --> 00:43.411
Chip left him outside all night.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.113
Don't put this on me!
I'm not his frickin' nurse.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.680
No, you're his family.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.549
You two are unbelievable.

00:48.582 --> 00:50.084
This poor bastard opens up
his home to us,

00:50.118 --> 00:52.353
and this is how you repay him?

00:52.386 --> 00:53.687
You're lucky
that he's still kind of alive.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.456
Oh, please. If he still
had his vocal cords,

00:55.489 --> 00:57.858
-he'd tell you to get your
lazy ass out of his house. -Hey!

00:57.891 --> 01:00.361
When I was your age, I shared
a room with my grandfather,

01:00.394 --> 01:01.695
and he used to have nightmares
about the war,

01:01.729 --> 01:03.931
and try and ride me around
like his horse.

01:03.964 --> 01:06.367
The least you can do is
take this guy to the groomer.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.635
-Long hair is in again.
-Yeah.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.036
If you love him so much,
you take him.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.572
Can't. I got plans.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.407
Oh, really? What plans?

01:13.441 --> 01:16.210
Important plans...
that are none of your business.

01:16.244 --> 01:18.379
Yeah, well, I got plans, too.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.813
The new Kevin Durants are
dropping today.

01:19.847 --> 01:21.048
I got to get in line.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.550
They're coke white. So sick.

01:22.583 --> 01:24.985
They make Yeezy Red Octobers
look like Stan Smiths.

01:25.018 --> 01:26.487
You hear that, Colonel?

01:26.520 --> 01:29.056
Your grandson's leaving you
for footwear. Excuse me.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.391
(Sabrina sighs heavily)

01:30.424 --> 01:32.393
I don't know. Maybe he's right.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.727
I mean,
we can't leave him like this.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.263
The man looks
like a melted candle.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.564
All right, well, tonight,

01:36.597 --> 01:38.232
we'll shave him
and hose him down.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.434
Chip,
we got to do something now.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.002
-But what about my kicks?
-Too bad!

01:42.035 --> 01:44.738
-I can't lug him around
by myself. -He's got wheels.

01:44.772 --> 01:48.142
Great, so you can wheel him to
the car, and I'll get the keys.

01:50.944 --> 01:54.282
Nah.

01:54.315 --> 01:58.619
(children laughing)

02:01.021 --> 02:03.424
(screams)
What?! No!

02:03.457 --> 02:05.959
No! Who threw this?! No...

02:05.993 --> 02:08.329
-So help me, God, I...
-(Mickey sighs, children giggle)

02:08.362 --> 02:10.764
-I got to get off this bus
before I lose it. -Oh.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.333
The sanitation center
was not nearly

02:12.366 --> 02:13.767
as awesome as you promised.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.036
-Yeah, so I lied to you.
Get over it. -I loved it!

02:16.069 --> 02:18.138
The floor was all gooey, and
my shoes made a noise like...

02:18.172 --> 02:19.773
-(makes squishing sounds)
-Ugh.

02:19.807 --> 02:22.776
-Can you guys come on every
field trip from now on? -No.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.813
Who learns anything at the dump?
It's outrageous.

02:25.846 --> 02:28.282
You have any idea how much
money we give this school?

02:28.316 --> 02:30.117
-How much?
-What?

02:30.150 --> 02:33.120
-Money. -Oh, I don't know,
but I'm guessing it's a lot.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.556
If I wanted to work in a dump,
I would get in a time machine

02:35.589 --> 02:36.990
and go back to the worse summer
of my life

02:37.024 --> 02:38.326
where I worked in a dump.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.860
If Gibbons ever tries
to force me

02:39.893 --> 02:41.229
into something like this again,

02:41.262 --> 02:43.297
I will snatch his ass
right out of his pants.

02:43.331 --> 02:44.665
You forced me to come.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.133
I didn't force you
into anything.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.337
Oh, you said if I don't come,
I will be your enemy.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.138
It's a figure of speech.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.740
You don't treat me
like an equal.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.676
Oh, shut up, dummy.
I treat you fine.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.982
No, no, no, no, no!
Sit down! Sit down!

03:02.015 --> 03:03.384
Got to do a quick head count.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.319
Two, four, six, eight, ten, 12,
four... Sit down!

03:05.353 --> 03:06.754
(muttering)

03:06.787 --> 03:09.156
-21?
-Yeah, that's what I got.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.824
Two, four, six, eight,

03:10.858 --> 03:12.159
ten, 12... (muttering)

03:12.192 --> 03:13.394
-21.
-Yeah, 21.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.895
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.497
How's that possible?
We left the dump with 20.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.198
-What? -What, did we pick up
an extra kid?

03:18.232 --> 03:22.303
-No. -All right, raise your hand
if you go to Lockwood.

03:23.471 --> 03:26.006
You-- what's your name?

03:26.039 --> 03:28.876
Hey, Benny, you know this kid?

03:28.909 --> 03:30.878
I've never seen him.

03:30.911 --> 03:34.214
Boy, did you come from the dump?

03:34.248 --> 03:36.250
Hello? Speak to me.

03:36.284 --> 03:37.885
¿Hablas español?

03:37.918 --> 03:39.720
Welcome back.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.188
Did we have fun?

03:41.221 --> 03:43.857
Oh, gosh, what a dump.
What a dump.

03:43.891 --> 03:47.094
Nice work. Looks like
everyone made it back alive.

03:47.127 --> 03:49.597
Yeah, and then some.

04:00.574 --> 04:03.544
Hey, Chip,
think you forgot something.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.113
Sabrina. Sabrina, wait.
No, you can't leave him here.

04:06.146 --> 04:09.149
Hey, hey! Take him back. Go.
(groans)

04:09.182 --> 04:10.818
Chip!

04:12.620 --> 04:14.422
Why do you want to look
like these idiots anyway?

04:14.455 --> 04:16.490
This dude's wearing tights
and a tunic.

04:16.524 --> 04:19.427
Sabrina, you know nothing
about culture.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.794
(Chip groans)

04:20.828 --> 04:22.930
-Get him out of here!
-No!

04:24.932 --> 04:26.800
Dude, you took my spot.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.737
Damn it, Sabrina.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.572
Now I have to go all the way
to the back of the line.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.840
You've ruined my life!

04:32.873 --> 04:34.508
Chip, you don't even
play basketball.

04:34.542 --> 04:36.310
You're four foot two
and you have the legs of a bird.

04:36.344 --> 04:37.745
They're not for basketball.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.448
They're on his lifestyle line.
God, I hate you!

04:40.481 --> 04:42.683
Yo, little man, go ahead and

04:42.716 --> 04:44.918
grab yourself a pair of Durants
so you can help your grandpa.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.955
-Seriously? -Most def.
You shouldn't have to choose

04:47.988 --> 04:50.391
between sneakers and family.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.428
My man! (laughs)

04:54.462 --> 04:56.029
BEN:
* We're going back to the dump *

04:56.063 --> 04:58.298
-* Dump, dump, dump,
we're going... * -Okay, relax.

04:58.332 --> 04:59.600
We're just dropping off
your friend,

04:59.633 --> 05:01.034
and then
we're going straight home.

05:01.068 --> 05:03.003
It's okay
that we're doing this, right?

05:03.036 --> 05:04.705
Of course.
We didn't do anything wrong.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.607
If anything, we'll be celebrated
for returning him.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.308
This whole thing is
a big misunderstanding.

05:08.342 --> 05:09.710
Cops, cops. Drive, drive.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.144
-Drive, drive, drive. Drive.
-Why? What?

05:11.178 --> 05:12.880
-Go, go, go, go, go.
Keep driving. -Okay, okay.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.314
(engine revving)

05:14.348 --> 05:16.684
My Aunt Mickey hates cops.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.023
Okay, Ben, here's some snacks.
Why don't you take Dump

05:23.056 --> 05:27.194
-and go show him your room?
-Come on, Dump, this way.

05:27.227 --> 05:30.864
-His name is Dump now?
-We had to call him something.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.700
Well, can't we do better
than Dump?

05:32.733 --> 05:34.502
Sure, Alba.
What do you want to call him?

05:34.535 --> 05:36.203
-Ignacio, after my great...
-Cool, sounds good.

05:36.236 --> 05:38.639
-What the hell are we gonna do?
-I don't know.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.307
You're the one
that made me drive away.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.675
Cops make me nervous.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.577
But I do know
that we just need to stay calm

05:43.611 --> 05:45.245
because we did not do anything
wrong.

05:45.278 --> 05:46.647
Well, except
we brought him home.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.315
Yeah, yeah, we did that.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.318
Okay, but maybe the cops were
looking for something else.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.686
-You know, it's a dump!
-Mm.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.722
People dispose
of all kinds of shady stuff.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.424
Mm-hmm. Okay, so, we go back,

05:56.457 --> 05:58.225
and we talk to them,
and we sort it all out.

05:58.258 --> 06:00.528
What are you, nuts?
Nah, they-they go poking around

06:00.561 --> 06:01.829
into our business,
and before you know it,

06:01.862 --> 06:03.230
I'm doing hard time,
and you're deported.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.766
-Well, I'm a citizen.
-They don't care anymore!

06:05.799 --> 06:08.736
-Well... Oh, that is true.
-But

06:08.769 --> 06:11.238
we could call the cops
and find out what they know.

06:11.271 --> 06:13.040
I just said that.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.842
You said talk to them,
which is absurd.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.610
I said call them.
Much smarter.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.278
Okay, okay, fine, we call them.

06:18.311 --> 06:19.913
-What? Are you insane?!
Not from our phone. -(gasps)

06:19.947 --> 06:22.249
Are you trying
to get us arrested?

06:22.282 --> 06:23.684
Well, you said
we were innocent.

06:23.717 --> 06:26.119
Ah, we are. Will you just please
listen to me, all right?

06:26.153 --> 06:28.088
-Go grab Ben and Ignacio
and meet me in the car. -Okay.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.023
And do you know what?
I got to say,

06:30.057 --> 06:31.959
after hearing it on its feet,
we're going back to "Dump."

06:31.992 --> 06:34.795
-I don't like "Ignacio."
It's stupid. -(Alba scoffs)

06:37.765 --> 06:40.601
I can't believe
they let you cut the line.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.369
This guy's like a celebrity.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.438
And they gave us free kicks.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.874
These are straight fire
and impossible to get.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.810
Kids-- they're getting
stomped on over these.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.379
I'm gonna be straight
dunking on fools.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.781
Kobe!

06:53.814 --> 06:55.883
Thought they were
a lifestyle shoe.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.651
They are,
but you can still hoop in 'em.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.319
God, you're so ignorant.

06:59.352 --> 07:03.123
Do you think everybody would
treat the colonel like that?

07:03.156 --> 07:04.892
Probably. When I said
he was a war hero,

07:04.925 --> 07:07.227
-they all looked like
they were gonna cry. -Ah.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.896
Oh, what sweet children.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.731
Those are some
dope kicks, Gramps.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.166
Wow. People are really suckers
for old men in wheelchairs.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.902
Yo, am I a horrible person
for thinking, like,

07:14.935 --> 07:16.504
what else we could we
get out of him?

07:16.537 --> 07:19.339
No. This is way better than
getting crapped on by birds.

07:19.372 --> 07:21.775
Yeah, he's out here,
he's getting fresh air,

07:21.809 --> 07:23.076
getting the respect he deserves.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.678
Yeah, we're not doing
anything wrong.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.847
I mean, last I checked,
this was a free country.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.516
(scoffs)
Yeah, thanks to him.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.484
Exactly. This is what
he fought for.

07:30.518 --> 07:33.687
You know what? I have an idea.
Let's get him cleaned up.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.430
Hey, wake up. Sorry,
gotta use this phone.

07:43.463 --> 07:44.798
I'm sure you know it's kinda
the last pay phone

07:44.832 --> 07:47.467
in the world, so move it--
hyah.

07:47.501 --> 07:50.804
-Ah! Ew! God, why is it so wet?
-Ugh.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.139
-Here.
-What? Why do I have to call?

07:52.172 --> 07:54.207
Because I've done literally
everything else.

07:54.241 --> 07:56.376
You want to be equals,
start pulling your weight.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.445
(groans)

07:58.478 --> 07:59.947
OPERATOR:
911 emergency.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.216
Yo, yo, you jive-ass turkey.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.985
What's the skinny on the po-po
down at the dump?

08:05.018 --> 08:06.654
OPERATOR:
I'm sorry?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.622
The coppers down at Fairfield
county sanitation,

08:08.656 --> 08:10.023
you mark-ass trick.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.792
OPERATOR: Are you calling
to report a crime?

08:11.825 --> 08:15.128
You tell me, Jack.
Five-O be buggin' me out!

08:15.162 --> 08:16.797
OPERATOR: I'll patch you through
to the detective on the case.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.165
What are you doing?

08:18.198 --> 08:20.668
I disguise my voice
to protect my identity.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.335
Yeah.
Yeah, I got that part.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.671
Did you have to be so racist?

08:23.704 --> 08:25.305
Is that how you think
black people talk?

08:25.338 --> 08:28.642
No! Who said anything about
talking like a black person?

08:28.676 --> 08:30.310
That was a cool white lady.

08:30.343 --> 08:34.982
Oh, no, you're a racist for
thinking that was a black voice.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.751
Huh. Okay.

08:37.785 --> 08:39.653
DETECTIVE HURLEY:
Hello? Hello?

08:39.687 --> 08:41.989
-Yeah?
-This is Detective Hurley.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.324
-Who am I talking to?
-Shut your mouth, bacon,

08:44.357 --> 08:46.827
-before I fry your greasy ass.
-All right.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.429
HURLEY: Okay.
Do you have information

08:49.462 --> 08:51.231
regarding the kidnapping?

08:51.264 --> 08:53.500
Kidnapping? No!
No, no, no, no kidnapping.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.735
We took him by accident.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.236
-What?
-HURLEY: So you do have the boy.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.706
-Dah!
-What did... What did you do?

08:58.739 --> 09:00.774
Well, he said we kidnapped him,
but we didn't.

09:00.808 --> 09:03.543
Well, now they think we did!
Ah! You blew it!

09:03.577 --> 09:05.012
Oh, no. You know what?
I call back,

09:05.045 --> 09:06.680
and I go, "Yo, yo,
it's just a prank, yo."

09:06.714 --> 09:08.849
It's not a prank!
There's a child missing.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.417
And now they probably already
traced the call.

09:10.450 --> 09:11.652
-We gotta move.
-Yeah, yeah.

09:16.156 --> 09:19.092
MAN:
I'm gonna have to see some ID.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.962
No, of course it's not for me,
it's for my dear grandfather.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.097
Yeah, he's a freaking war vet.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.699
He's killed, like,
a ton of Germans,

09:25.733 --> 09:27.735
and he does not like waiting,
so hurry up.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.637
Unless you hate freedom.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.471
Okay, one lemon drop, coming up.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.807
Holy crap, it actually worked.

09:33.841 --> 09:37.544
People are so stupid.
Or patriotic, I guess.

09:37.577 --> 09:41.148
Excuse me, I noticed that your
grandfather has a purple heart.

09:41.181 --> 09:44.652
I served in Iraq, and I'd like
to pay for the officer's drink.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.453
Aw, be my guest, soldier.

09:46.486 --> 09:51.124
You know, he mentioned wanting
to try the ahi tostada as well.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.765
He'd salute you back,
but his arms are paralyzed

09:57.798 --> 10:00.768
from punching so many Nazis
in the dong.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.305
The colonel frickin' rules.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.240
I don't even find him
that disgusting anymore.

10:07.274 --> 10:11.244
-For someone so ancient, he's
a pretty legit guy. -Mm-hmm.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.247
Oh. Sweet.
And you can keep 'em coming.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.849
He might seem like
a lightweight,

10:15.883 --> 10:17.250
but those Navy men can
really put 'em back.

10:17.284 --> 10:20.020
-Alcohol helps with his PTSD.
-Mm-hmm.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.689
Where is he?

10:21.722 --> 10:23.657
He's right over--

10:23.691 --> 10:25.793
-What the hell?
-Where'd he go?

10:25.826 --> 10:27.427
-Colonel?
-Wha...

10:27.460 --> 10:29.797
Colonel?
Colonel?

10:34.201 --> 10:35.703
We just gotta figure out
where the kid lives,

10:35.736 --> 10:37.037
you know, so we can just
drop him off

10:37.070 --> 10:38.672
and wash our hands
of this whole mess.

10:38.706 --> 10:39.807
-Oh, check his wallet.
-He's seven.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.341
He doesn't carry a wallet.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.442
Well, look in his pockets.

10:42.475 --> 10:43.643
I'm not rooting around in

10:43.677 --> 10:46.013
some little boy's pants,
all right?

10:46.046 --> 10:47.514
Look, he obviously knows more
than he's telling us.

10:47.547 --> 10:48.816
We just gotta dig it out of him.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.017
Yeah, okay.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.319
-I will be bad cop. Yeah.
-No, no cops.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.721
I-I don't, I don't like where
you're headed with that.

10:53.754 --> 10:54.788
Let's not do cop thing.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.890
We'll just talk to him,

10:56.924 --> 10:59.392
have a casual conversation.

10:59.426 --> 11:00.627
(gunfire from video game)

11:00.660 --> 11:01.895
Okay, guys,

11:01.929 --> 11:03.196
we're going to take
a little break from

11:03.230 --> 11:05.132
-the video games for a second.
-Hey, I was playing that.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.835
Dump, listen, I'm gonna ask you
some questions,

11:07.868 --> 11:11.038
and if you answer those
questions, uh...

11:11.071 --> 11:13.373
you get to take
all the video games home.

11:13.406 --> 11:14.842
Those are mine.

11:14.875 --> 11:18.145
You like golf, Dump?
I don't. Never have.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.314
It's too slow.
And I don't like slow things.

11:21.348 --> 11:24.151
Maybe because I've never been
a very patient person.

11:24.184 --> 11:27.654
Do you think you two could
just be quiet for a second

11:27.687 --> 11:29.322
and let me ask the questions?

11:29.356 --> 11:31.524
-It's all yours.
-Yeah, wouldn't that be cool?

11:31.558 --> 11:33.493
-Everyone's cool.
-Does that sound nice?

11:33.526 --> 11:35.829
-We're all gonna be cool. -Okay,
you ready for this one?

11:35.863 --> 11:39.266
Uh, where do you live?

11:42.770 --> 11:44.337
What are you doing?

11:44.371 --> 11:46.273
What? You said he could have
the games if he answered.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.507
Well, I didn't say
smash everything

11:47.540 --> 11:48.842
to pieces if he didn't.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.277
Well, you didn't have to,
it was implied.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.846
No, it wasn't implied.
Stop it.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.948
What is wrong with us?
He's a little kid.

11:54.982 --> 11:56.349
We should be able
to figure this out.

11:56.383 --> 11:57.785
Okay, okay.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.252
Yeah. Maybe we don't feed him.

11:59.286 --> 12:00.520
No.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.922
Okay, maybe we overfeed him.

12:01.955 --> 12:03.924
No torture.
That's what kidnappers do,

12:03.957 --> 12:05.425
and we're not kidnappers.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.027
Well, we kinda are.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.361
I mean, we took him.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.197
We established communication
with the police.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.032
We brought him
to a second location.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.134
All right, well, when you list
it all out like that,

12:14.167 --> 12:16.036
it sure doesn't sound good.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.470
Mickey, what are we going to do?

12:17.504 --> 12:18.972
I don't know!

12:19.006 --> 12:21.208
-Mickey! -I don't know
what we're gonna do

12:21.241 --> 12:23.811
-because you won't let me think
for two seconds! -Mickey, stop!

12:25.913 --> 12:29.416
You know what, I got an idea.
Let's go find a new pay phone.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.284
All right.

12:36.656 --> 12:40.427
Ooh! Wow. This one smells like
someone gave birth.

12:40.460 --> 12:41.895
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.630
Maybe we don't push our luck
with the police.

12:43.663 --> 12:46.233
Why can't we leave Dump here?
No body, no crime.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.335
No, that's a murderer thing--
we're kidnappers now.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.603
Now, here's the plan.
We're gonna call the police

12:50.637 --> 12:52.605
and give 'em a drop point--
it's kidnapping lingo--

12:52.639 --> 12:53.740
and then when they're off

12:53.773 --> 12:54.741
on a wild goose chase,

12:54.774 --> 12:55.843
we will safely unload Dump

12:55.876 --> 12:57.577
-on the other side of town.
-Okay.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.847
-Do you think this will work?
-We don't have much of a choice,

12:59.880 --> 13:01.915
do we, Huggy Bear?

13:01.949 --> 13:03.450
OPERATOR:
911 emergency.

13:03.483 --> 13:06.419
Uh, yah, I kidnap-a from
a sanitation center.

13:06.453 --> 13:10.790
I demand speak with most
honorable policeman. Shh.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.362
HURLEY: This is Detective
Hurley. Who am I talking to?

13:15.395 --> 13:18.265
Oh, you talk to yourself,
you don't shut your mouth.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.334
You listen to me.
I have boy you seek.

13:21.368 --> 13:22.802
HURLEY:
Is the child unharmed?

13:22.836 --> 13:24.137
Yes, child fine!

13:24.171 --> 13:26.206
HURLEY: Look, the boy is
hearing-impaired,

13:26.239 --> 13:28.775
-and his parents are
very worried. -Can't hear.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.210
HURLEY: They're prepared to
comply with all of your demands,

13:30.243 --> 13:31.778
they just want him back safely.

13:31.811 --> 13:36.116
Oh, you greedy Americans think
everything about money.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.885
Well, I have no demand.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.787
No, I seek a peaceful
resolution.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.155
-No, wait, wait, wait.
-What?

13:42.189 --> 13:43.991
Isn't a kidnapper
without demands

13:44.024 --> 13:45.859
just a child molester?

13:47.727 --> 13:49.997
Oh, sorry, no, no, no.

13:50.030 --> 13:53.066
I-- I have demand.
Big demand.

13:53.100 --> 13:56.203
I-I ask one million
American dollar.

13:56.236 --> 13:59.839
Uh, Greenwich Park one hour.
Arigato.

13:59.873 --> 14:04.177
Wha... Ah, Mickey,
that was very offensive.

14:04.211 --> 14:06.313
Wh-What are you talking about?
That's what you did.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.681
I picked an accent
and disguised my voice.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.383
An Asian accent?

14:10.417 --> 14:12.719
Oh! Oh, you...

14:12.752 --> 14:14.988
Oh, Alba, who's racist now, huh?

14:15.022 --> 14:16.423
You thought that was Asian? Hmm?

14:16.456 --> 14:18.091
-Mm-hmm.
-You said "arigato."

14:18.125 --> 14:20.760
Y-Yeah, I mean,
for authenticity.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.562
And with the u-utmost respect.

14:22.595 --> 14:25.498
There is no one more ancient
or mystic than the Chinese.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.100
"Arigato" is Japanese.

14:27.134 --> 14:29.236
Okay...
(stammers)

14:29.269 --> 14:31.738
...uh, how do you say "good-bye"
in Chinese? "Chow."

14:31.771 --> 14:34.007
-And that is Italian.
-Okay, I'm sorry, all right?

14:34.041 --> 14:36.509
I-I'm... I don't know, I'm doing
my best here. Okay? I'm sorry.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.278
I'm uneducated
and I'm ignorant.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.280
Excuse me if nobody bothered
to-to teach me stuff.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.514
You kn-- t-this is your fault.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.882
-What? Ooh.
-This is all your fault.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.851
I could have figured this out if
you had just left me alone,

14:44.884 --> 14:47.720
I could have figured it out, but
no, you insist on being equals.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.356
And before I know it,
I-I'm a racist kidnapper

14:49.389 --> 14:50.723
with a child being molested
in the...

14:50.757 --> 14:52.859
Oh, where'd they go?

14:52.892 --> 14:54.394
-Uh, Ben?
-But...

14:54.427 --> 14:56.696
What?

14:56.729 --> 14:58.231
They left a note.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.233
"You can't take
my new best friend.

15:00.267 --> 15:02.802
"We are going to the coolest
place in the world

15:02.835 --> 15:04.437
where you will never find us."

15:04.471 --> 15:06.473
Oh.
(moans)

15:06.506 --> 15:09.442
-Those sons of bitches went back
to the dump. -Ugh.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.382
And what'd he look like?

15:15.415 --> 15:17.384
He's, like, 80 pounds,

15:17.417 --> 15:20.220
three and a half feet tall,
at least a hundred years old.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.123
He's like a human statue
on wheels, dressed like JAG.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.725
Nope, I haven't seen anyone
like that.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.560
Maybe he decided to go home.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.762
He can't decide anything,
his brain's a wasteland.

15:29.796 --> 15:32.099
His mind's working overtime
just to blink.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.466
You know what? Forget it.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.235
This is useless.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.104
(sighs)
I hope he's okay.

15:37.137 --> 15:40.407
Maybe Jimmy was right about us.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.075
Screw Jimmy.
None of this would have happened

15:42.109 --> 15:43.310
it if he hadn't forced us
to hang out

15:43.343 --> 15:45.078
with the Colonel
in the first place.

15:45.112 --> 15:48.081
I mean, we shouldn't have to do
anything we don't want to do.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.849
Duh. This is a free country.

15:49.882 --> 15:51.484
Once again, thanks to him.

15:51.518 --> 15:52.919
He basically fought
for our freedom

15:52.952 --> 15:54.254
to not have to hang out
with him.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.089
Yeah, plus,
we shouldn't be trusted

15:56.123 --> 15:57.424
with this kind of
responsibility.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.426
-We're just kids.
-(scoffs)

15:59.459 --> 16:00.860
(gunshot sounds)

16:00.893 --> 16:03.196
(phone ringing)

16:03.230 --> 16:05.332
(groans)
What?

16:05.365 --> 16:07.500
Where are you?
What's that noise?

16:07.534 --> 16:09.436
Chip, I'm in the middle
of something, what do you want?

16:09.469 --> 16:11.704
All right, we need your help.
We lost the colonel.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.040
How the hell did you do that?

16:13.073 --> 16:14.507
I don't know, he just escaped.

16:14.541 --> 16:15.875
Doesn't he have, like,
a microchip in him

16:15.908 --> 16:17.777
-or something you can track?
-No.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.846
There's not a microchip
in him. He is not a dog.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.981
He's a helpless old man.
He's probably out there

16:22.015 --> 16:23.516
getting mugged or raped

16:23.550 --> 16:26.453
or turned into
some kind of sex doll-- uh...

16:26.486 --> 16:28.121
You there?

16:28.155 --> 16:31.058
ARCADE GAME:
Reload.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.859
You got it.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.627
-Why'd you hang up? -He doesn't
have a chip, but I left my phone

16:34.661 --> 16:38.398
in his chair.
We can track that.

16:39.999 --> 16:40.967
(shouts)

16:41.000 --> 16:42.335
(gasps)

16:42.369 --> 16:43.670
Oh.

16:44.904 --> 16:46.973
Oh...

16:47.006 --> 16:49.576
I hate this place so much.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.646
Are you okay?

16:53.680 --> 16:56.349
Oof.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.418
-Oh, shh, shh.
-(dog growling)

16:58.451 --> 17:00.420
Just... big dog.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.389
-Okay. Ooh...
-(dog growling)

17:02.422 --> 17:03.523
Okay.

17:03.556 --> 17:04.724
Just stay calm.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.994
If we just relax,
he'll leave us alone.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.329
Just go.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.863
What?

17:10.897 --> 17:12.332
(barks)

17:12.365 --> 17:14.434
I will take care of the dog.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.503
-Okay. -(barks) -And if I do
this, we are equals?

17:16.536 --> 17:18.938
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.

17:18.971 --> 17:21.708
Okay, doggie.

17:21.741 --> 17:23.676
Okay, I'm ready for you.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.011
-(barks)
-(screams)

17:25.044 --> 17:26.946
Ben!

17:26.979 --> 17:28.415
(sighs)

17:28.448 --> 17:30.250
Ben!

17:32.051 --> 17:33.520
(whimpers)

17:33.553 --> 17:36.856
Come on, Ben, let's go home.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.191
BEN:
I am home.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.792
Dump and I are gonna
live here forever,

17:39.826 --> 17:41.761
and you can't take him away.

17:41.794 --> 17:45.365
Buddy, his parents
are very worried about him.

17:45.398 --> 17:47.033
But he's my friend.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.368
I'm your friend, too.

17:48.401 --> 17:50.036
No, you're not, you hate trash,

17:50.069 --> 17:51.271
and you said you'd never go

17:51.304 --> 17:53.206
on another field trip
with me again.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.109
All right, I'm sorry.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.445
I see that that
was very selfish, okay?

17:58.478 --> 18:00.046
And I'll make it up to you.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.881
Whatever you want, just name it.

18:01.914 --> 18:06.586
I want you to come on every
field trip with me from now on.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.388
Oh, man,
that's not gonna happen.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.257
Then I'm not coming down.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.092
Okay, how about this?

18:13.126 --> 18:15.162
I will go on one more field trip
with you, okay?

18:15.195 --> 18:19.132
Every field trip
for the next ten years.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.967
What? Have you lost...

18:21.000 --> 18:22.235
All right.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.070
I got a great idea.

18:24.103 --> 18:25.338
'Cause you drive
such a hard bargain.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.340
I will go on
one field trip with you

18:27.374 --> 18:30.743
every other year
for a hundred years.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.245
100 years?

18:32.279 --> 18:33.846
Yep, a cool century.

18:33.880 --> 18:34.947
Deal.

18:34.981 --> 18:37.016
Yes! Come on.

18:37.049 --> 18:40.320
All right, you guys okay?

18:40.353 --> 18:44.090
Oh, dear God.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.226
It's taken care of.

18:54.201 --> 18:55.502
Where the hell are we?

18:55.535 --> 18:57.270
-This place looks like Detroit.
-Shh. Quiet.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.439
You're gonna get us jumped.
It says that he's over there.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.107
SABRINA and CHIP:
Grandpa!

19:01.140 --> 19:02.775
CHIP:
No! They took his Durants!

19:02.809 --> 19:04.277
Oh, my God.

19:04.311 --> 19:06.145
Thank God,
everything's still here.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.647
Except his Durants.

19:07.680 --> 19:11.150
Savages! I told you,
people are going nuts for these.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.852
I'm so sorry, Grandpa.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.454
Dude, I'm not even sure
he felt them on his feet.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.122
Of course he did,
they're Durants.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.790
Then give him yours.
They're the same size.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.526
No frickin' way,
I already 'grammed them.

19:19.559 --> 19:21.828
People are gonna be expecting me
to rock them tomorrow.

19:21.861 --> 19:24.231
Whatever, let's just
bring him home, okay?

19:24.264 --> 19:28.067
-(sniffles) -Uh, well, we had
a great day with you, Grandpa.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.403
-You're the best.
-A genuine American hero.

19:30.437 --> 19:32.205
Now I understand
when they call you guys

19:32.239 --> 19:33.540
the greatest generation.

19:33.573 --> 19:37.076
You're an all-around
chill-ass guy.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.077
Good?

19:38.110 --> 19:40.012
(strains)

19:40.046 --> 19:42.915
Come on, Grandpa.

19:42.949 --> 19:44.351
-I got it.
-(chuckles)

19:44.384 --> 19:46.185
SABRINA:
Great day.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.156
He's over here!

19:50.189 --> 19:52.359
(indistinct police radio
transmission)

20:02.068 --> 20:04.203
OFFICER 2:
Is he okay?

20:06.038 --> 20:08.775
(children laughing)

20:13.580 --> 20:15.282
Ugh!

20:15.315 --> 20:17.116
Get any more on my jeans,
and me and you

20:17.149 --> 20:18.918
are gonna have words,
understand?

20:18.951 --> 20:23.022
Aunt Mickey, what did you think
of the mustard factory?

20:23.055 --> 20:25.024
It was, uh, not my favorite.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.126
Honestly, that school needs
to fully reimagine

20:27.159 --> 20:28.595
its entire field trip program.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.397
Like, what happened
to the classics?

20:30.430 --> 20:32.365
Your zoos,
your botanical gardens?

20:32.399 --> 20:34.767
Your-your old-timey villages?

20:34.801 --> 20:36.269
Well, speak for yourself.
(chuckles)

20:36.303 --> 20:37.437
That place delivered.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.238
Yeah, mustard rules.

20:39.272 --> 20:40.873
I can't wait to go back.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.041
(sighs)

20:42.074 --> 20:43.376
(grunts, shouts)

20:43.410 --> 20:44.711
That's it!

20:44.744 --> 20:46.713
The next person who throws
anything at me

20:46.746 --> 20:49.215
is getting drowned
in a vat of mustard!

20:49.248 --> 20:50.983
CHILDREN:
Yay!

20:51.017 --> 20:52.619
No! No, no...

20:52.652 --> 20:54.487
That's a punishment,
not a reward.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.723
What is the matter
with you maniacs?

20:56.756 --> 20:58.257
Stop it!

20:58.291 --> 21:01.928
Stop it! Stop!

Shut your mouth, bacon!

21:12.204 --> 21:14.173
Hope you
enjoyed
kickin' it
with The Mick.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.476
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.413
It's time we fly
this old bird.

21:20.447 --> 21:23.350
* It feels good *

21:23.383 --> 21:26.285
MULDER: I want to believe.
I would just like to see.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.086
I can help you.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.088
* It feels good *

21:29.121 --> 21:30.690
-You want to do
the honors, Alan?
-Yeah!

21:30.723 --> 21:32.091
No, you never
touch this.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.860
* You know it feels good *

21:33.893 --> 21:35.495
-(shrieks)
-* It feels good *

21:35.528 --> 21:37.464
* Oh, you know it feels good *

21:37.497 --> 21:39.532
Let's do it.

21:39.566 --> 21:41.868
Everything you thought
you knew about medicine
is wrong.

21:45.004 --> 21:45.938
Unbelievable.

21:45.972 --> 21:47.540
* It feels good *
