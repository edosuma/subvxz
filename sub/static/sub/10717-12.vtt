* (instrumental theme)

00:13.010 --> 00:16.343
FX presents The Americans.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.318
Previously on
"The Americans"...

00:21.350 --> 00:23.011
Hey, Stan.
"When the door became stuck

00:23.050 --> 00:25.541
"while attempting
to remove some files,

00:25.590 --> 00:27.979
Agent Gaad
pulled repeatedly."
(beeping)

00:28.020 --> 00:30.989
While it was being repaired,
there was a death there.

00:31.030 --> 00:33.726
We just got something new in
from Fort Detrick.

00:33.760 --> 00:36.160
It's the worst thing
I've ever seen.

00:36.200 --> 00:41.228
I was thinking about not telling
the Centre about this.

00:41.270 --> 00:45.036
Amador. Nina.
My old boss got killed.

00:45.070 --> 00:47.834
I think you guys
might've done it.

00:47.880 --> 00:51.702
There's been talk about
blackmailing you.

00:51.750 --> 00:54.412
I don't want you
on my conscience, too.

00:54.450 --> 00:57.510
This is the last time
we're gonna see each other.

00:57.550 --> 00:59.211
Got a cigarette?

00:59.260 --> 01:01.057
No, we don't.

01:01.090 --> 01:03.024
Don't be scared, sweetheart.

01:03.060 --> 01:04.027
(grunting)

01:04.060 --> 01:05.357
No!

01:05.390 --> 01:07.255
Aah!

01:07.300 --> 01:09.393
(man groaning)

01:10.600 --> 01:14.229
ELIZABETH:
Let's go. PaIge, now!

01:16.240 --> 01:18.037
(beeping, lasers firing)

01:18.070 --> 01:21.039
(groaning)
Oh, he's gonna get you.
He's gonna get you!

01:21.080 --> 01:23.048
(groans loudly)
Oh, ho!

01:23.080 --> 01:24.741
(blows air)
Let me show you
how it's done.

01:24.780 --> 01:28.113
Yeah, do.

01:28.150 --> 01:30.209
(beeping)
(exhales deeply)

01:30.250 --> 01:32.309
Hey, guys.

01:35.660 --> 01:38.925
We're fine. We're fine.
We, um, we almost got mugged.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.291
What?
We're okay.

01:40.330 --> 01:42.127
Uh, there were just...
We yelled,

01:42.170 --> 01:45.799
and the guys ran,
and, um...

01:45.830 --> 01:47.263
It was just scary.

01:49.100 --> 01:53.070
I'm gonna...just go.

01:53.110 --> 01:57.979
Uh, your mother and I are
gonna...settle down your sister.

02:17.630 --> 02:18.824
He was dead.

02:22.540 --> 02:23.802
Was he dead?

02:23.840 --> 02:27.503
I don't know. I...
There were two guys.

02:27.540 --> 02:30.008
One of them had a knife.
And I had to. I --
She, like...

02:30.050 --> 02:31.301
She just...
It's okay.

02:31.350 --> 02:32.840
(exhales deeply)
Shh,shh,shh,shh,shh.

02:32.880 --> 02:35.644
It's okay. It's okay.
(smooches) It's okay.

02:37.820 --> 02:38.980
(whispers) It's okay.

02:41.720 --> 02:44.325
Don't we have to call
the police?

02:45.490 --> 02:46.650
We have to call the police.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.952
We can't do that, honey.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.025
We can't draw any attention
to ourselves.

02:56.040 --> 03:00.670
Did you have to...
do that?

03:05.410 --> 03:07.219
Yeah, I did.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.089
I feel sick.

03:22.700 --> 03:24.167
It was...

03:24.200 --> 03:26.532
(whispers)
I know. It's okay.

03:29.200 --> 03:32.374
**

04:09.910 --> 04:11.070
(knocks on door)

04:11.110 --> 04:12.611
Are they okay?
Yeah.

04:12.650 --> 04:15.073
What happened?

04:15.120 --> 04:16.417
They were walking
to the car,

04:16.450 --> 04:18.042
uh, from the food pantry
downtown.

04:18.090 --> 04:21.548
Couple guys came up to them,
but they scared them away.

04:21.590 --> 04:22.887
So, they didn't get mugged?

04:22.930 --> 04:25.888
No, no, but it was
really upsetting.

04:25.930 --> 04:27.750
Okay.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.597
Okay?
Yeah.

04:29.630 --> 04:33.236
Good night, bud.
Good night.

04:33.270 --> 04:36.159
(sighs)

04:45.280 --> 04:48.579
I'm sorry,
but I have to go out.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.417
Now?

04:50.450 --> 04:52.247
Just -- just for a bit.

04:52.290 --> 04:55.259
Where are you going?

04:55.290 --> 04:57.758
(sighs)
I have to meet with someone.

04:57.790 --> 05:00.953
Is it work?

05:02.630 --> 05:04.860
Yeah.

05:31.990 --> 05:34.390
How did you know how
to do that?

05:39.200 --> 05:43.159
I was trained
to defend myself.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.030
Dad, too?

05:51.680 --> 05:53.045
It was just so fast,

05:53.080 --> 05:55.810
and I didn't even know
what was happening.

05:55.850 --> 05:57.386
And...

05:57.420 --> 06:01.481
he was just...

06:01.520 --> 06:04.318
I was so scared.
I know.

06:06.760 --> 06:10.161
You -- you were,
like, calm.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.532
How could you be calm?

06:12.570 --> 06:14.731
You...

06:14.770 --> 06:17.204
you killed him, Mom.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.532
I wasn't gonna let him
hurt you.

06:23.710 --> 06:28.545
And then it was just
all happening so fast.

06:28.580 --> 06:29.888
Ijust...

06:35.760 --> 06:38.729
Have you...
done that before?

06:44.400 --> 06:45.719
Have you?

06:49.970 --> 06:52.131
To protect myself, yeah.

06:56.280 --> 06:58.578
How many times?

07:02.750 --> 07:03.978
I don't know.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.466
Were you scared?

07:25.640 --> 07:27.301
I'm sure you guys
are frustrated

07:27.340 --> 07:28.898
with the rate of repair
on the Los Angeles equipment.

07:28.940 --> 07:31.249
Ah, I keep telling them --

07:31.280 --> 07:33.419
That's not why I'm here.

07:33.450 --> 07:36.078
I wanna ask you
about your mother.

07:36.120 --> 07:38.748
She died here, in the --
in the office.

07:38.790 --> 07:40.758
Yeah.

07:40.790 --> 07:42.758
You found her when you came
into work the next morning

07:42.790 --> 07:44.257
and called 9-1-1.

07:44.290 --> 07:47.088
Yeah, she had
a bad heart.

07:47.130 --> 07:48.757
She worked alone
at night?

07:48.800 --> 07:51.997
Well, not really. I mean,
she liked to come here at night.

07:52.030 --> 07:54.590
She was 87.
She lived alone.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.461
This gave her a place to go,
to -- to feel useful.

07:57.510 --> 07:59.432
But you weren't
surprised then?

07:59.470 --> 08:01.779
What do you mean?
No, I wasn't surprised.

08:01.810 --> 08:03.346
This was her place.

08:03.380 --> 08:06.440
You know, she and my dad
started the shop.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.118
No autopsy was performed?

08:08.150 --> 08:09.447
No.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.448
And no follow-up
investigation?

08:11.490 --> 08:14.118
(scoffs)
An investigation for what?

08:14.160 --> 08:16.458
She'd been sick
for a long time.

08:16.490 --> 08:18.822
(sighs) Is there something
I should know?

08:18.860 --> 08:21.829
Oh. No, it's fine.

08:21.860 --> 08:23.122
I'm sorry for your loss.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.569
Thank you.

08:38.680 --> 08:40.739
(men shouting playfully)

08:52.900 --> 08:56.893
(playful shouting continues,
basketball bouncing)

08:59.430 --> 09:01.694
(sighs deeply)

09:01.740 --> 09:06.200
4-9-2-6-3.

09:13.250 --> 09:17.710
Lassa fever is
a very undignified way to go.

09:17.750 --> 09:21.379
You basically dissolve
inside,

09:21.420 --> 09:24.389
then squirt yourself
out your anus...

09:24.430 --> 09:26.557
in liquid form.

09:26.600 --> 09:30.627
First, it's whoosh.
Then it's a trickle.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.060
The modified strain
you want --

09:35.100 --> 09:41.107
the strain Level Four
is hard at work perfecting...

09:41.140 --> 09:45.270
(sighs)
It's even more lovely.

09:50.620 --> 09:52.918
I can't do this one,
Philip.

10:00.160 --> 10:01.593
You're afraid.

10:01.630 --> 10:04.895
Who wouldn't be?

10:04.930 --> 10:07.728
But i-it's not that,

10:07.770 --> 10:09.567
I can do things
I'm scared of.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.467
I've been doing things
I'm scared of for years.

10:12.510 --> 10:13.807
But this...

10:15.440 --> 10:18.648
...is one of the deadliest
pathogens on the planet.

10:19.950 --> 10:25.479
Just...say it actually
gets out there.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.151
And I play a part in that?

10:45.340 --> 10:47.376
What do you want me
to tell Gabriel?

10:52.980 --> 10:55.847
(sighs)
Tell him the truth.

10:59.020 --> 11:00.658
Are you sure?

11:05.330 --> 11:07.298
(whispers) Yeah.

11:07.330 --> 11:10.493
**

11:31.890 --> 11:33.357
Oleg...

12:10.390 --> 12:12.221
Oleg...

13:10.320 --> 13:11.810
(door opens)

13:12.960 --> 13:15.087
(exhales deeply)

13:15.120 --> 13:16.678
Hey.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.594
(whispers) She asleep?
Finally.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.961
No school tomorrow?
Yeah.

13:35.140 --> 13:36.801
Are you okay?

13:39.510 --> 13:40.875
I don't know.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.641
I just keep...

13:44.690 --> 13:48.217
replaying it over and over
in my head.

13:53.060 --> 13:55.392
You got her out of there.

13:59.700 --> 14:03.158
(sighs)

14:07.210 --> 14:12.807
You know, right before...

14:12.850 --> 14:14.215
She was telling me about

14:14.250 --> 14:17.686
this conversation she had
with Matthew.

14:17.720 --> 14:20.553
Stan told him about Martha,
that she was a spy,

14:20.590 --> 14:24.219
and that he had met with
her father and that it was hard.

14:25.930 --> 14:31.061
Paige is reporting this
to me.

14:31.100 --> 14:34.194
**

14:46.880 --> 14:49.872
**

15:54.620 --> 15:57.111
They ought to tear
this goddamn building down.

15:57.150 --> 16:00.415
And fire everyone
who works in it, including us.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.984
We have to set up
on the mail robot.

16:02.020 --> 16:04.580
Whatever that thing is,
someone's gonna switch it out.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.257
Tech guys aren't sure
how long it runs.

16:06.290 --> 16:07.826
You know what?

16:07.860 --> 16:10.090
I don't really give a shit
who's switching it out.

16:10.130 --> 16:11.427
We'll just do the usual --

16:11.470 --> 16:13.597
flip him,
have him make his drop.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.267
We pick up some idiot
from the Soviet embassy

16:15.300 --> 16:17.939
with diplomatic immunity,
and PNG them.

16:17.970 --> 16:21.508
And nothing changes.

16:21.540 --> 16:23.474
Welcome to_
the dIVIS|on, Sllâ€˜.

16:27.380 --> 16:29.473
Maybe we could shoot him.

16:36.690 --> 16:38.351
(knock on door)

16:41.560 --> 16:43.323
Cocoa.

16:46.870 --> 16:49.794
You sleep at all?

16:49.840 --> 16:52.229
Not really.

17:07.020 --> 17:08.419
(sighs)

17:11.260 --> 17:14.889
It's. . .dangerous,

17:14.930 --> 17:17.069
what you and Dad do.

17:19.230 --> 17:22.199
Sometimes. Yeah.

17:24.910 --> 17:29.233
But when I asked you that,
you said it wasn't.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.370
We didn't want you
to worry.

17:42.060 --> 17:47.088
Did you know it'd be dangerous
when you joined?

17:47.130 --> 17:49.291
I wanted to serve
my country.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.739
You never answer
my questions.

17:55.600 --> 17:57.238
That is my --
It's always,

17:57.270 --> 17:59.864
"I wanna make the world
better or -- or safer,"

17:59.910 --> 18:03.869
but it's never
what happened.

18:03.910 --> 18:06.447
Never the whole truth.

18:16.120 --> 18:20.250
I grew up in a city
called Smolensk.

18:23.970 --> 18:27.736
It was almost totally
destroyed during the war.

18:27.770 --> 18:29.829
World War II.

18:35.440 --> 18:37.908
I was only 2
when it ended, but...

18:37.950 --> 18:41.772
growing up there,
it was...

18:45.120 --> 18:48.612
Everything around me
was destroyed.

18:50.460 --> 18:55.124
And the people
who survived...

18:55.160 --> 18:59.859
had done without food
and...freezing and fighting.

19:01.800 --> 19:05.964
They all worked together
and fought back somehow.

19:10.480 --> 19:14.473
I guess I always wanted
to be like that,

19:14.520 --> 19:15.839
no matter what.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.639
To fight back.

19:22.990 --> 19:26.323
Dangerous didn't matter.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.238
By the time I left...

19:44.680 --> 19:48.343
...they had rebuilt
so much of it.

19:48.380 --> 19:50.587
Can't imagine
what it looks like now.

19:55.860 --> 20:00.183
I wish I could take you there.
I wish...

20:00.230 --> 20:04.098
I could show you
where I grew up.

20:07.600 --> 20:09.363
(chuckles)

20:17.280 --> 20:18.577
(sighs)

20:20.780 --> 20:22.042
(sighs)

20:30.590 --> 20:32.387
Mm-hmm.

21:28.980 --> 21:30.948
(sighs)

22:26.070 --> 22:29.176
(sighs)

23:05.580 --> 23:09.175
WOLFE: Did she know
who she was working for?

23:09.220 --> 23:12.712
She met a guy
at a Roy Rogers in Franconia.

23:12.750 --> 23:14.513
Hints he's part of the mob,

23:14.560 --> 23:15.879
that they're worried
we're about to sting

23:15.920 --> 23:17.854
_ one of _
their gambling operations.

23:17.890 --> 23:20.927
Offers her 500 bucks a week
to change out the recorder.

23:20.960 --> 23:24.225
Is she gonna
make the drop?
Yeah.

23:25.900 --> 23:29.893
Let's get set up.
Still_ think we're
wasting our time?

23:29.940 --> 23:32.261
I talked to the Director.

23:32.310 --> 23:35.529
He's talking to
the State Department.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.104
And it looks like we're
going to be able

23:37.140 --> 23:39.973
to spread the pain
a little higher up the ladder.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.420
(line ringing)

24:00.100 --> 24:02.466
WOMAN: Hello?
I'm calling
about your daughter.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.434
Who is this?
Please let me speak.

24:04.470 --> 24:06.404
I have to be brief.

24:06.440 --> 24:09.432
She's fine. She's doing well.

24:09.480 --> 24:10.742
She's being taken care of

24:10.780 --> 24:13.442
by people who respect her
very much.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.573
She'll always be taken care of.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.076
And she wants you to know
she loves you

24:17.120 --> 24:19.145
and thinks about you.

24:19.190 --> 24:21.454
We'll be in touch again
if we can.

24:21.490 --> 24:23.151
(gasps) Wait.

24:23.190 --> 24:26.455
Wait --
(hangs up receiver)

24:37.300 --> 24:38.961
(telephone ringing)

26:15.270 --> 26:18.262
We do go back,
don't we?

26:18.310 --> 26:22.872
To childhood,
growing up together

26:22.910 --> 26:24.707
These past eight years

26:24.750 --> 26:27.241
must've been horrible
for you, Grant.
(sighs)

26:27.280 --> 26:30.443
Mom, you don't have to
sit with me if you hate it.

26:30.480 --> 26:32.789
I'm okay.

26:32.820 --> 26:34.788
No, no, no. I'm...

26:34.820 --> 26:36.082
just trying
to understand.

26:38.430 --> 26:42.457
It's not logical,
it's emotional.

26:42.500 --> 26:45.424
Okay.

26:45.470 --> 26:47.119
WOMAN:
Please understand, Grant.

26:47.170 --> 26:49.968
(door opens)
HENRY: Hey!

26:50.000 --> 26:51.137
Hi, Henry.

26:51.170 --> 26:54.435
Hi, Matthew.
Hey.

26:54.480 --> 26:57.904
Are you okay?
Uh, Henry said you were sick.

26:57.950 --> 27:01.147
Yeah, I-I just had
a stomachache. I'm better now.

27:01.180 --> 27:03.648
I could be dead, and Mom
wouldn't let me stay home.

27:03.690 --> 27:05.419
ELIZABETH: Do you guys
want something to eat?

27:05.450 --> 27:07.816
Yes, please.
Sure. Yeah.

27:07.860 --> 27:10.988
Matthew,
come play me.

27:11.030 --> 27:13.282
You know you can hook the
computer up to the TV, right?

27:13.330 --> 27:14.991
You know how to do that?

27:15.030 --> 27:16.497
Yeah,
my cousin showed me.

27:16.530 --> 27:18.088
Sweet. Let's do it.

27:18.130 --> 27:20.598
Wait.
What are you doing?
Don't worry, Mom.

27:20.630 --> 27:22.166
Yeah, it's okay,
Mrs. Jennings.

27:22.200 --> 27:25.761
It's really easy to unhook
when you wanna watch TV.

27:25.810 --> 27:28.131
Hey, uh, you wanna help?

27:29.480 --> 27:31.175
Sure.

27:33.310 --> 27:36.438
STAN: So, how many shifts
you think we'll need to pull

27:36.480 --> 27:38.118
before they pick it up?

27:38.150 --> 27:40.118
Well, they wouldn't want
to leave it out there too long.

27:40.150 --> 27:44.553
On the outside?
We're there all night.

27:59.010 --> 28:01.376
Hey, I'm gonna head out
for a couple hours.

28:04.880 --> 28:07.576
(door opens, closes)

28:08.680 --> 28:10.648
Have you seen
the antenna switchbox?

28:10.680 --> 28:12.147
I don't know
what that is.

28:12.190 --> 28:13.885
It's a small box that we plug
TV cables into.

28:13.920 --> 28:15.080
Try the garage?

28:21.360 --> 28:23.157
You're totally making
Henry's life right now.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.667
(door closes)
Henry's cool.

28:24.700 --> 28:27.567
Your dad_'s been
really great With him, too.

28:27.600 --> 28:30.330
Yeah, he's good
with young kids.

28:30.370 --> 28:32.531
But not teenagers?

28:32.570 --> 28:34.231
Well...

28:40.210 --> 28:43.213
Do you ever worry...

28:43.250 --> 28:45.548
about his job
being dangerous?

28:45.590 --> 28:49.686
I guess.
Uh, I don't know.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.927
He was und_ercover _
when we were In St. Lours.

28:51.960 --> 28:53.257
I think that was scary.

28:53.290 --> 28:56.259
Uh, chasing spies, uh...

28:56.300 --> 28:58.188
it's not, like,
car chases and stuff.

28:58.230 --> 29:00.266
It's more like, uh...

29:00.300 --> 29:04.031
There's a lot of figuring out,
waiting.

29:04.070 --> 29:06.538
He says being an FBI agent
taught him patience.

29:06.570 --> 29:08.936
(chuckles)

29:12.080 --> 29:15.413
Okay, we need
this cable.

29:31.670 --> 29:35.231
(sighs) I went to
Bauman Technical University.

29:35.270 --> 29:37.738
It's like your MIT.
And I can tell you,

29:37.770 --> 29:40.637
we have the best scientists
in the world,

29:40.670 --> 29:43.275
but we don't have the money,
andiUs--

29:43.310 --> 29:45.346
it's not_ _
a good combination.

29:48.320 --> 29:52.245
I'm getting worried, Stan.
All those brains, what...

29:52.290 --> 29:55.259
what they're doing.
(sighs)

29:55.290 --> 29:57.781
Without the right resources,
they get their hands on things

29:57.830 --> 30:01.095
that they cannot always
handle in the right way.

30:01.130 --> 30:03.928
Don't --
don't ask me questions.

30:03.970 --> 30:05.494
This --
This isn't like that.

30:05.530 --> 30:08.135
Okay.

30:08.170 --> 30:10.434
There are...
things we're doing.

30:10.470 --> 30:13.769
They're too dangerous.
They need to...

30:13.810 --> 30:16.836
I can't call Andropov
and say "stop."

30:16.880 --> 30:19.678
I know.

30:19.710 --> 30:23.441
If your people know that
certain things are happening,

30:23.480 --> 30:27.189
that treaties are being broken,
maybe it all stops.

30:27.220 --> 30:29.609
If you bring this
to the right people...

30:29.660 --> 30:32.458
I will.

30:32.490 --> 30:36.153
I'm giving you something --
one thing.

30:36.200 --> 30:40.022
After this, we're done.
Okay.

30:42.900 --> 30:46.301
Do you know anything
about biological weapons?

30:46.340 --> 30:47.978
Not really.

30:48.010 --> 30:52.845
Your military makes them --
or tests them. I-I don't know.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.677
Someplace.
I don't know where.

30:56.680 --> 31:00.309
They send some of the work out
somewhere else.

31:00.350 --> 31:03.808
We have someone there.

31:03.860 --> 31:07.023
At that place,
or -- or one of those places.

31:13.870 --> 31:16.589
That's it.

31:44.770 --> 31:46.692
I just saw Burov.

31:46.730 --> 31:49.369
He gave me enough pieces
to Put something together --

31:49.400 --> 31:53.029
probably an agent in place,
working on biological weapons.

31:53.070 --> 31:56.403
Now I don't have much yet,
but...I think it's big.

31:56.440 --> 31:59.238
Anybody else
know alblout this?
0.

32:00.910 --> 32:01.808
Aderholt.

32:05.620 --> 32:07.315
We have to let them pick up
their dead drop.

32:10.460 --> 32:12.883
Pull everyone
off the drop site

32:12.930 --> 32:15.057
except for one car
with a video camera.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.455
What's going on?
Stan's got something big.

32:17.500 --> 32:19.627
We can't shake up anything
at the Rezidentura right now.

32:23.270 --> 32:25.659
**

33:17.360 --> 33:20.659
Philip tells me
you're having second thoughts.

33:26.370 --> 33:30.966
I started this because
I believed in something.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.675
I was young, idealistic.

33:36.510 --> 33:39.809
It gets hard after a while
to keep that up.

33:39.850 --> 33:43.638
And now...this...

33:43.680 --> 33:47.138
(sighs)

33:47.190 --> 33:50.159
How can I believe in this?

33:50.190 --> 33:52.579
With all the damage
it can cause?

33:56.030 --> 34:00.729
Well, it is hard to believe
in things that kill people.

34:03.540 --> 34:08.034
And you haven't seen the people
you're defending in too long.

34:10.240 --> 34:14.609
I think you have to see them,
William.

34:16.920 --> 34:19.047
What the hell
does that mean?

34:19.090 --> 34:21.888
You've given
almost your whole life

34:21.920 --> 34:23.888
to your country, to your people.

34:25.960 --> 34:28.895
It's time.
It's time for you to come home.

34:28.930 --> 34:31.728
And they're waiting for you.

34:31.770 --> 34:36.389
You'll be a hero.

34:36.440 --> 34:38.761
You'll find a wife.
You'll have a family.

34:44.480 --> 34:47.108
I know you've lost your sense
in why we do this,

34:47.150 --> 34:52.588
but I promise you...
it matters.

34:59.760 --> 35:02.399
You'll do this one last thing...

35:02.430 --> 35:06.093
And when you go home,

35:06.130 --> 35:09.293
you and your loved ones
and all of our people

35:09.340 --> 35:12.104
will be safer because of it.

35:23.950 --> 35:26.111
Employee list
for Foster Medical.
Thanks.

35:26.150 --> 35:28.983
The other two labs?
Still waiting.

35:29.020 --> 35:31.784
Thank you.

35:31.830 --> 35:35.994
All right, so,
we'll just look through,

35:36.030 --> 35:37.622
see who they've got
in the top-secret

35:37.660 --> 35:39.924
bio-weapons
research division, right?

35:39.970 --> 35:41.437
Or we just send
the whole list

35:41.470 --> 35:44.769
out to the field offices,
call it a night?

35:44.810 --> 35:48.109
I wish they'd put
their clearances on here.

35:48.140 --> 35:49.630
It'd be someone
wrth real access --

35:49.680 --> 35:51.136
scientists, researchers.

35:51.180 --> 35:52.807
High-level admin staff.

35:52.850 --> 35:54.442
Security guy, maybe.

35:54.480 --> 35:56.448
Think we can eliminate
the accountants?

35:56.480 --> 35:59.142
Now we're
getting somewhere.
Oh, yeah.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.855
I didn't think you'd be able
to change his mind.

36:03.890 --> 36:06.984
Deep down, he loves his country
more than anything.

36:10.160 --> 36:11.969
And he wants to go home.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.662
(chuckles)
It's that simple?

36:14.700 --> 36:16.793
I didn't change his mind.

36:16.840 --> 36:19.866
I reminded him who he is
and gave him what he wants.

36:25.710 --> 36:28.178
And if that wasn't
who he was anymore?

36:28.220 --> 36:31.144
I don't know.

36:31.180 --> 36:34.889
I agreed with William,
thought we just should keep

36:34.920 --> 36:37.684
the whole damn thing
to ourselves.

36:39.690 --> 36:42.227
I'm not sure who was right
about this one.

36:45.900 --> 36:48.061
You can always count
on Elizabeth.

36:50.870 --> 36:54.931
She's steadfast.
You need that.

36:59.780 --> 37:02.715
The Centre made
a good match.
Mm.

37:05.290 --> 37:08.350
I'm sorry, Philip.

37:08.390 --> 37:10.381
I need to sit down.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.027
Ah.

37:17.060 --> 37:20.120
Whew.

37:23.770 --> 37:26.898
I used to think
I'd do better,

37:26.940 --> 37:30.205
serve the Centre better,
ifI kept to myself.

37:30.240 --> 37:33.607
You work alone,
there's no one there

37:33.650 --> 37:37.768
tearing away at you,
weakening you.

37:37.820 --> 37:40.789
But...

37:40.820 --> 37:44.779
You go to shit anyway.

37:44.830 --> 37:47.151
And you're still alone.

37:57.300 --> 37:59.803
Thanks for the ride.
Really, it's no sweat.

37:59.840 --> 38:02.229
When are you gonna get
your license?

38:02.280 --> 38:03.975
As soon as I learn
how to parallel park.

38:04.010 --> 38:05.773
I could teach you.

38:05.810 --> 38:09.075
Yeah.
I can try.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.610
Dad?

38:13.150 --> 38:15.618
Is he still at work?

38:15.660 --> 38:19.983
He hasn't been home
in a few days.

38:20.030 --> 38:21.452
Sorry.

38:23.860 --> 38:25.259
I mean, he's the one

38:25.300 --> 38:26.927
that wanted me back here
a few days a week.

38:26.970 --> 38:29.461
I was fine staying
with my mom.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.138
You didn't miss him?

38:31.170 --> 38:35.436
I did, but I don't care
where I sleep.

38:35.480 --> 38:38.643
I'm glad you're back.

38:38.680 --> 38:41.274
Things have been weird
at my house.

38:41.310 --> 38:42.948
Weird how?

38:42.980 --> 38:46.108
Just, uh, stupid parent stuff.
They treat me like I'm 12.

38:46.150 --> 38:49.449
Yeah.

38:49.490 --> 38:51.310
Do you still
have your band?

38:51.360 --> 38:54.022
No. Uh, we --
we weren't very good.

38:54.060 --> 38:56.949
(chuckles)
Yeah, you really weren't.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.467
What happened
to that girl?

38:58.500 --> 39:00.297
What was her name?
Uh, Celery?

39:00.330 --> 39:04.460
Celery. Yes, uh, her whole
family is named after produce.

39:04.510 --> 39:07.206
(chuckles)

39:35.740 --> 39:37.696
Okay.

39:37.740 --> 39:40.231
Okay.

39:42.580 --> 39:44.571
I should --
I should get home.

39:44.610 --> 39:47.443
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

39:54.090 --> 39:56.513
(door opens, closes)

39:56.560 --> 39:57.879
(exhales)

40:03.730 --> 40:05.266
Hi, honey.
How was school?

40:05.300 --> 40:09.191
Okay.
Matthew drove me home.

40:09.240 --> 40:13.563
He told me his dad
hasn't been home in two days.

40:17.080 --> 40:18.570
I-is that important?

40:22.080 --> 40:23.547
What's going on
with you two?

40:23.580 --> 40:26.083
Nothing. We're friends.

40:28.420 --> 40:30.752
Oh, my God.
I-I'm not dating him.

40:30.790 --> 40:32.883
Well, you want
to date him?

40:32.930 --> 40:36.297
What? No. I...I mean,
I don't know. I...

40:36.330 --> 40:37.592
I like him, but...

40:39.430 --> 40:41.466
Henry's really close
to Mr. Beeman,

40:41.500 --> 40:43.559
and we_ have no idea what
he's saying to hIm about us.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.807
You don't have to worry
about that.

40:45.840 --> 40:48.729
Why not?
You have to be careful
with Matthew, Paige.

40:48.780 --> 40:50.634
With. . .everyone.

40:50.680 --> 40:54.309
Paige, you can have friends.
We want you to have friends.

40:54.350 --> 40:56.409
You have to be careful
who you open up to.

40:56.450 --> 40:58.941
Yeah, I-I got that point.

40:58.990 --> 41:02.915
I'm not opening up,
I'm just talking to him.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.450
You talk to Mr. Beeman
all the time.

41:04.490 --> 41:06.253
He's practically
a member of the family.

41:06.290 --> 41:09.418
Yeah, that --
that's different.

41:09.460 --> 41:11.928
How?
We don't need you

41:11.970 --> 41:13.790
to get close
to Matthew for us.
I'm just --

41:13.830 --> 41:16.435
You want to be Matthew's friend,
be Matthew's friend,

41:16.470 --> 41:18.836
but don't do anything
because of us.

41:18.870 --> 41:21.259
You do not have to worry
about that.

41:21.310 --> 41:23.972
You wanted me to worry
about Pastor Tim and Alice.
That is very different --

41:24.010 --> 41:26.342
When I wanted
nothing to do with them,

41:26.380 --> 41:28.109
you told me I had to stay
close with them,

41:28.150 --> 41:29.947
(telephone ringing)
no matter how shitty
I felt about it.

41:29.980 --> 41:32.517
That is different.
No, it isn't.

41:32.550 --> 41:34.313
You always say
we'll get through this,

41:34.350 --> 41:36.887
but you never say how.
I...(sighs)

41:41.660 --> 41:44.458
Hello?

41:44.500 --> 41:46.991
Yeah, he's --
he's right here.

41:47.030 --> 41:48.793
Thanks.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.638
Hello?

41:51.670 --> 41:52.967
Yes, Phil Jennings.

41:53.010 --> 41:55.979
Yeah, uh-huh, got it.
Thank you.

41:56.010 --> 41:58.478
Louisville field office
found a William Crandall.

41:58.510 --> 42:01.479
Born Paducah,

42:01.510 --> 42:06.140
Died Bowling Green,
July 12, 1932. Age 5.

42:06.190 --> 42:09.318
Foster Medical, right?
Or w-was it,
uh, Pace Labs?

42:09.360 --> 42:12.523
**

42:17.530 --> 42:18.428
Got him.

42:21.370 --> 42:23.531
Figure this guy's already made
his surveillance detail.

42:23.570 --> 42:25.401
Who's been on him?
Got it right here.

42:25.440 --> 42:28.159
Let's see.
Teams "B" and "D."

42:28.210 --> 42:29.837
Get "A" and "C" up
and on the street.

42:29.880 --> 42:31.029
And get two teams down
from New York,

42:31.080 --> 42:33.105
ready to take the next shift.

42:34.450 --> 42:36.418
No, I understand. They should've
already been ticketed.

42:36.450 --> 42:38.839
I'll...t_ake care of it
right now.

42:38.890 --> 42:41.085
Sure. Thank you. Bye.

42:41.120 --> 42:43.054
What was that about?

42:44.390 --> 42:46.426
I'm sorry.
I have to go.
But who was it?

42:46.460 --> 42:48.599
(sighs) Work.

42:51.060 --> 42:52.368
What's going on?

42:52.400 --> 42:55.369
Paige, I can't give you
the details right now.

42:55.400 --> 42:58.039
You guys said you were done
lying to me,

42:58.070 --> 42:59.537
that it was different now
because you could trust me.

42:59.570 --> 43:00.867
We're not lying to you,
Paige,

43:00.910 --> 43:03.037
but you don't need to know
everything.

43:03.080 --> 43:04.900
You just killed a man
in front of me.

43:04.950 --> 43:08.772
I might as well know
everything.

43:08.820 --> 43:11.948
**

43:15.420 --> 43:17.650
Do you trust me or not?

43:20.590 --> 43:22.729
(sighs heavily)

43:22.760 --> 43:24.796
I'm gonna meet
with a man we work with,

43:24.830 --> 43:26.718
and he's gonna hand something
over to me

43:26.770 --> 43:28.761
that our...country needs.

43:28.800 --> 43:30.768
What?

43:34.610 --> 43:37.602
Part of a weapon that
our army will use to fight

43:37.640 --> 43:39.301
if we're ever attacked.

43:47.020 --> 43:48.681
Great.

43:56.630 --> 43:59.519
**

44:41.270 --> 44:42.931
(shutter clicks)

44:47.610 --> 44:50.511
I guess you never really
know a person, do you?

44:51.520 --> 44:53.078

45:19.080 --> 45:20.707
Cheers.
Whoo-hoo!

45:20.750 --> 45:23.378
You are not lousy in bed.
You just need a little help.

45:23.420 --> 45:24.944
-(grunting)
-What does that mean?

45:26.250 --> 45:29.617
I'm gonna get famous

45:29.660 --> 45:31.412
