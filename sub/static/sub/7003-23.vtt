WEBVTT

00:02.635 --> 00:05.770
Fuses in, wired up.

00:05.771 --> 00:07.806
I'm gonna try the horn.
Cover your ears, mark.

00:09.441 --> 00:11.610
Aah!

00:15.514 --> 00:18.349
Dad, the horn
is blinding me!

00:21.053 --> 00:22.988
Just a crossed wire, son.

00:22.989 --> 00:24.990
That's what it's gonna
say on your tombstone -

00:24.991 --> 00:27.558
"it was just
a crossed wire."

00:27.559 --> 00:31.329
We've gotta get in the kitchen
and start making those cupcakes
for the school carnival.

00:31.330 --> 00:35.299
Honey, there's one thing
you should know about men -
we don't make cupcakes.

00:35.300 --> 00:38.236
Come on, you promised me
that you'd help me.

00:38.237 --> 00:42.340
Another thing you should
know about men - we lie.

00:42.341 --> 00:44.976
Tim, I have thousands
of those things to make.

00:44.977 --> 00:48.246
I can't believe
you're not gonna pitch in
and help with this carnival.

00:48.247 --> 00:49.614
I did pitch in.

00:49.615 --> 00:51.816
Don't forget about
my "stump the tool man" booth.

00:51.817 --> 00:53.151
How could I forget?

00:53.152 --> 00:57.088
Last year, you
kept getting stumped
by that 12-year-old.

00:57.089 --> 00:59.991
Did you get
the cardboard cutouts
for the photo booth?

00:59.992 --> 01:02.426
Yeah, right over here.

01:02.427 --> 01:03.995
This is for the men...

01:07.833 --> 01:11.435
<i>(imitates</i>
<i>arnold schwarzenegger)</i>
maria! Maria!

01:11.436 --> 01:14.172
I can't itch my own back!

01:15.274 --> 01:16.975
And for the women...

01:16.976 --> 01:18.710
<i>(jill laughs)</i>

01:20.379 --> 01:22.881
Hi.
It's lovely, tim.

01:22.882 --> 01:26.617
Her thumb is on the wrong side
of her right hand,
and she has no left arm.

01:28.988 --> 01:31.723
I didn't even notice
that she had any arms.

02:42.161 --> 02:44.528
What do you think? Could we
put the kids in the middle?

02:50.069 --> 02:53.337
Gotcha! Gotcha again!
Gotcha back!

02:53.338 --> 02:55.339
What are you guys
doing?

02:55.340 --> 02:58.743
We're doing our taxes.
What's it look like?

02:58.744 --> 03:00.011
I got winner.

03:00.012 --> 03:01.913
I was here first.
I've got winner.

03:01.914 --> 03:04.015
No way we're playing you.
You stink.

03:04.016 --> 03:06.584
You stink
even worse than dad.

03:06.585 --> 03:10.121
Hey, a little respect.
I stink the most.

03:10.122 --> 03:12.023
I've seen mark play.
He could beat you guys.

03:12.024 --> 03:13.291
No way. Gotcha!

03:13.292 --> 03:15.794
Gotcha!
How about a little wager?

03:15.795 --> 03:18.596
If mark beats the winner,
you both clean the basement.

03:18.597 --> 03:23.067
If you can beat him,
the movies all afternoon on me.

03:23.068 --> 03:25.603
<i>(computer)</i> kill!

03:25.604 --> 03:26.637
Well?

03:26.638 --> 03:28.773
I accept the challenge.
Have a seat.

03:28.774 --> 03:30.875
One game, winner take all?

03:30.876 --> 03:33.178
You guys
got your jockstraps on?

03:35.014 --> 03:36.547
All right, here we go.

03:36.548 --> 03:38.917
One, two, three, go!

03:38.918 --> 03:40.651
Go, go.
What are you doing?

03:40.652 --> 03:42.821
Ha-ha!

03:42.822 --> 03:44.789
<i>(computer)</i> kill!
I win!

03:51.030 --> 03:53.198
When you guys are down there
cleaning that basement,

03:53.199 --> 03:55.834
Don't touch
those hot-rod magazines.
That's your inheritance.

03:58.603 --> 04:00.604
How could you
let him beat you?

04:00.605 --> 04:03.374
I was overconfident.
I'm used to playing dad.

04:04.844 --> 04:06.410
Hi, sweetie.
Hi, mom.

04:08.147 --> 04:10.748
Hi, jill.
Hi.

04:10.749 --> 04:13.484
I just heard
the most depressing story.

04:13.485 --> 04:16.754
I suppose you're gonna
share it with me?
Yes, I am.

04:16.755 --> 04:19.423
I've been researching
that article on plastic surgery.

04:19.423 --> 04:23.694
I just interviewed a woman
who bought herself
a whole new body

04:23.695 --> 04:27.999
Because her husband left her
for a younger woman.

04:28.000 --> 04:31.069
They were married 12 years,
had four kids.

04:32.838 --> 04:34.839
She made a big mistake.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.108
I'm glad you feel that way.

04:37.109 --> 04:41.279
Had she had this surgery
some time ago, she could
have saved the marriage.

04:47.386 --> 04:49.420
You've come
a long way, tim.

04:49.421 --> 04:52.490
Listen, jill...
After 12 years of marriage
and all those kids,

04:52.491 --> 04:55.826
Women tend to
let themselves go,
spread out.

04:55.827 --> 04:58.129
Most men aren't
as forgiving as I am.

05:01.967 --> 05:06.837
Excuse me. Did you say
that you have forgiven me
for letting myself go?

05:06.838 --> 05:09.507
No, that's not what I said.

05:09.508 --> 05:13.912
That is exactly
what you said.

05:13.913 --> 05:16.147
Well, I didn't mean that.

05:16.148 --> 05:17.916
What did you mean?

05:25.624 --> 05:29.093
I... I mean...

05:29.094 --> 05:32.696
Those tigers
have a shot at the pennant
with good pitching this year.

05:35.167 --> 05:37.168
Does everybody know
what time it is?

05:37.169 --> 05:39.170
<i>(all)</i> tool time!

05:39.171 --> 05:41.172
That's right. Binford tools
is proud to present

05:41.173 --> 05:43.674
Tim "the tool man"
taylor! Whoo!

05:48.547 --> 05:51.715
Thank you, heidi,
and welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

05:51.716 --> 05:53.217
I'm tim "the tool man" taylor,

05:53.218 --> 05:55.853
And you all know my assistant -
al "table for one" borland.

05:57.456 --> 06:00.091
Need I remind you
that I now have
a significant other?

06:00.092 --> 06:03.294
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's al "table for two" borland.

06:03.295 --> 06:07.265
But if his
mom's dining with him, it's
al "table for seven" borland.

06:07.266 --> 06:11.035
"al, where's the salad bar?"
<i>(moos)</i>

06:12.604 --> 06:14.839
We're gonna show you
how to refinish a table today,

06:14.840 --> 06:17.442
And we'll show you
the steps necessary
using these three tables,

06:17.443 --> 06:20.478
All of which we bought
for $3 at a garage sale.

06:20.479 --> 06:23.114
Actually, I bought them,
and you haven't
reimbursed me yet.

06:23.115 --> 06:26.050
Before we refinish,
let's decide what kind of wood
we're dealing with.

06:26.051 --> 06:29.653
A simple pat underneath
will tell you if you're
dealing with raw wood or -

06:29.654 --> 06:31.456
Eww - old chewing gum.

06:31.457 --> 06:33.524
Al can actually determine
what flavor it is

06:33.525 --> 06:35.659
Just by tasting it.
Take a try.

06:35.660 --> 06:37.996
I don't think so, tim.

06:37.997 --> 06:41.366
Now, the underside
of this table
has been painted,

06:41.367 --> 06:43.434
So, marv, if you wanna
come down here...

06:43.435 --> 06:46.337
We're gonna chip away
a little bit
of the paint there,

06:46.338 --> 06:48.339
Find out what
we're dealing with.

06:48.340 --> 06:52.276
It's maple,
one of my favorite
types of wood.

06:52.277 --> 06:54.278
Yeah, and syrup.
Ha-ha-ha.

06:57.049 --> 07:02.453
All right, so next step
after you've identified
the type of wood

07:02.454 --> 07:05.023
Is, uh, stripping the wood.

07:05.024 --> 07:07.058
Now, obviously,
we've stripped this side.

07:07.059 --> 07:09.827
We used insta-strip
by binford.

07:09.828 --> 07:12.663
After you finish stripping,
acknowledge your applause,

07:12.664 --> 07:14.632
Gather up your clothes
and head back to your trailer.

07:19.271 --> 07:22.373
All right, now we're ready
for sanding.

07:22.374 --> 07:26.577
In this case, you wanna use
binford's 6100 palm sander.

07:26.578 --> 07:28.579
If you don't own
a palm sander,

07:28.580 --> 07:30.581
Use a sanding attachment
to any binford drill.

07:30.582 --> 07:32.616
Don't use an attachment
on fine furniture

07:32.617 --> 07:34.985
Because it will leave
unsightly swirl marks.

07:34.986 --> 07:36.554
Says who?
Everybody.

07:38.290 --> 07:40.358
And you listen
to what everybody says?

07:40.359 --> 07:41.926
Unless it's you.

07:47.566 --> 07:49.567
I'll show you, al.
I'll prove it to you.

07:49.568 --> 07:52.336
Heidi, my super-sander,
please.

07:52.337 --> 07:54.905
Here you go, tim.
Thank you, heidi.

07:54.906 --> 07:56.140
Thank you.

07:57.709 --> 07:59.944
Before you sand this table,
will you reimburse me?

08:07.919 --> 08:10.754
It's stuck in the middle!
Move it around!

08:10.755 --> 08:14.425
Don't leave it in one spot!
You'll wreck it!

08:14.426 --> 08:16.194
How do you know?

08:23.868 --> 08:27.705
Now all we need
is a square peg.

08:27.706 --> 08:29.474
Al, hop in!

08:38.217 --> 08:40.251
Whoa!

08:40.251 --> 08:43.754
Check out this babe
on dad's hot-rod magazine.

08:45.824 --> 08:48.559
Whoa. One question.

08:48.560 --> 08:51.929
Who works on a car
in a bikini and high heels?

08:51.930 --> 08:54.832
I do. Oh!

08:57.869 --> 08:59.870
Unless I'm working
under the car.

08:59.871 --> 09:02.806
Then I go with
a halter top and flats.

09:02.807 --> 09:06.244
You're supposed
to be working on the basement,
not gawking at my car magazines.

09:06.245 --> 09:09.614
Dad, we've been working
all morning.
We needed a babe break.

09:09.615 --> 09:11.782
Don't call her that.
She's got a name.

09:11.783 --> 09:14.452
Ohh...

09:14.453 --> 09:18.289
That's miss dual exhaust 1984.

09:18.290 --> 09:21.325
Get back to work, guys.
Let me do the gawking.

09:21.326 --> 09:24.362
Well, you're allowed to gawk,
aren't you, dad?

09:24.363 --> 09:27.598
I don't gawk. I've got
all the babe I need
right upstairs.

09:27.599 --> 09:29.900
Does mom know about her?

09:31.903 --> 09:37.141
All right, wise guy,
come here and look at these.

09:37.142 --> 09:38.543
Who's that?

09:38.544 --> 09:41.212
Whoa!

09:42.447 --> 09:44.715
She's a babe!

09:44.716 --> 09:47.151
She's your mom!

09:50.021 --> 09:53.191
I just called my mom
a babe.

09:53.192 --> 09:56.227
Who's the good-looking guy
next to her in this picture?

09:56.228 --> 09:59.497
That would be... Not me.

09:59.498 --> 10:02.933
There's a lot of "not you's"
in this box, dad.

10:02.934 --> 10:06.270
The important thing is,
I'm with her now, beanhead.

10:06.271 --> 10:10.208
Why would mom pick you
out of all these
good-looking guys?

10:10.209 --> 10:12.410
I was good-looking
as these guys once.

10:12.411 --> 10:14.778
You had to be better looking
than that geek.

10:16.682 --> 10:19.684
I'd say that geek's
pretty good-looking, actually.

10:23.255 --> 10:25.723
The geek is dad.

10:35.367 --> 10:37.568
This is what tim picked
for the carnival.

10:37.569 --> 10:40.571
It figures.
That's what all men want.

10:40.572 --> 10:42.607
Oh, no, not al.

10:42.608 --> 10:45.976
Al too. Last time we went
miniature golfing,

10:45.977 --> 10:49.347
There was a woman ahead of us
wearing a skin-tight t-shirt.

10:49.348 --> 10:52.750
It's the only time
I've ever seen al
go 28 over par.

10:54.419 --> 10:56.554
I'm so disillusioned.

10:56.555 --> 10:57.888
All right, let me try.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.461
I bet you
those aren't even real.

11:06.465 --> 11:09.400
They're a lot more real than
some I've been seeing lately.

11:09.401 --> 11:11.201
Excuse me?

11:11.202 --> 11:14.104
I'm doing research
for that article
on plastic surgery.

11:14.105 --> 11:16.574
I even have this
computer program
that shows you

11:16.575 --> 11:19.710
How you can change
your appearance.
You gotta see this.

11:19.711 --> 11:23.881
You can change your lips,
your butt, your thighs,
your waist, anything.

11:23.882 --> 11:26.517
Here, let me...
Yeah, well...

11:26.518 --> 11:28.286
Ok, watch this.

11:30.121 --> 11:32.423
That's amazing.

11:32.424 --> 11:34.925
Now watch this.
If you press b,

11:34.926 --> 11:38.562
Your breasts just get bigger
and more torpedo-like.

11:39.631 --> 11:43.000
Ew, isn't that gross?

11:43.001 --> 11:45.269
Wow!
What?

11:45.270 --> 11:46.937
Wow!

11:46.938 --> 11:50.073
Are you saying you think
I'd look good like that?

11:55.480 --> 11:57.948
No. It was a general wow.

11:57.949 --> 11:59.717
General wow?

11:59.718 --> 12:03.287
The famous
chinese military guy -
general wow...

12:04.456 --> 12:06.924
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

12:06.925 --> 12:08.959
You saw that
picture of me

12:08.960 --> 12:10.894
And said "wow"
with your tongue
hanging out.

12:10.895 --> 12:15.366
I did not. You can't say
"wow" with your tongue
hanging out...

12:15.367 --> 12:18.268
Wuhhhow.

12:18.269 --> 12:21.071
I guess this'd be a good time
for me to be going. Bye, tim.

12:21.072 --> 12:23.507
Bye-bye. See you later.

12:23.508 --> 12:26.109
Thank you so much for helping me
with all the cupcakes.

12:26.110 --> 12:30.715
Yeah, I love cupcakes.
Big, ample cupcakes.

12:38.457 --> 12:40.491
Jill, you gotta see this.

12:40.492 --> 12:42.526
Now I know why
they call it "the boob tube."
look at this.

12:44.963 --> 12:47.331
Tim, what are you doing?

12:47.332 --> 12:49.734
I'm just playing around
with the thing.

12:49.735 --> 12:51.836
They look like
hot-air balloons.

12:51.837 --> 12:53.838
You could travel
around the world
with those.

12:53.839 --> 12:55.673
Look out, honey,
they're gonna blow!

12:57.809 --> 13:00.378
Could you be
any more obnoxious?

13:00.379 --> 13:02.413
Is that a request?
I'm just playing
with the thing.

13:02.414 --> 13:05.015
Tim, there are women
whose self-esteem
is so low,

13:05.016 --> 13:07.685
They're actually doing this
to their bodies.

13:07.686 --> 13:10.388
That is horrible. Sorry.

13:10.389 --> 13:12.590
Now, how would I make
your butt a little smaller?

13:19.598 --> 13:21.665
Maybe I'll just sleep
down here tonight.

13:25.937 --> 13:28.205
You're done with your research.
Why is the computer hooked up?

13:28.206 --> 13:31.341
Come over here.
I want you to see something.

13:31.342 --> 13:33.343
Hey, there's
a good-looking guy.

13:33.344 --> 13:35.746
Here.

13:35.747 --> 13:42.453
Take this keyboard
and show me what you think
is my ideal tim.

13:42.454 --> 13:44.221
Sounds like fun.
What do I gotta do?

13:44.222 --> 13:46.657
You hit d for delts,
b for biceps,

13:46.658 --> 13:49.393
W for waist, p for pecs.

13:49.394 --> 13:51.829
Are you sure
p is for pecs?

13:54.666 --> 13:56.767
Just press the p.

14:00.972 --> 14:04.909
There we go.
"the timinator."

14:04.910 --> 14:07.611
You are so far off.

14:07.612 --> 14:10.848
Let me show you
my ideal tim.

14:14.419 --> 14:15.920
That's it?

14:15.921 --> 14:17.955
Yeah.

14:17.956 --> 14:21.959
Tim... It's you
that I find sexy.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.027
And whatever changes
that you go through,

14:24.028 --> 14:26.396
I'm gonna find those
sexy, too.

14:26.397 --> 14:28.566
Even if you
look like this.

14:39.177 --> 14:40.978
Yikes.
Or this.

14:47.719 --> 14:52.389
Ok, I've told you how I feel.
I wanna know how you feel.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.693
Do you want me the way
I look now,

14:55.694 --> 14:57.728
Or would you like me
to get my tummy tucked,

14:57.729 --> 15:00.664
My face lifted
and breasts enlarged?

15:00.665 --> 15:02.867
The way you are now.

15:02.868 --> 15:04.602
Thank you.

15:11.009 --> 15:12.409
Hey.

15:12.410 --> 15:14.011
Just out of curiosity...

15:14.012 --> 15:18.616
What would the other version
cost us, the whole package,
out the door?

15:27.358 --> 15:30.193
Maybe I should
just live down here.

15:35.901 --> 15:38.135
<i>(sniffs)</i> something burning
out here, wilson?

15:38.136 --> 15:40.303
No need to be alarmed, tim.

15:40.304 --> 15:42.806
I'm just smoking a fish.

15:42.807 --> 15:45.409
Regular or menthol?

15:45.410 --> 15:48.946
No, no, tim. I'm curing
an alaskan salmon.

15:48.947 --> 15:51.448
My only concern is
what wine to have it with.

15:51.449 --> 15:54.885
Love to help you,
but I got a concern of my own.

15:54.886 --> 15:58.889
It started with me
turning jill's breasts
into hot-air balloons

15:58.890 --> 16:00.958
And getting
kind of excited about it.

16:00.959 --> 16:02.993
I think you've finally
found a problem

16:02.994 --> 16:04.795
That's out of my realm
of expertise.

16:04.796 --> 16:07.064
No, you don't understand.

16:07.065 --> 16:09.066
She had this
computer simulation

16:09.067 --> 16:12.235
That showed
some cosmetic surgeon's
alterations to her body.

16:12.236 --> 16:15.105
It reminded me
of when she was young,
when I first met her.

16:15.106 --> 16:16.774
I kinda liked it.

16:16.775 --> 16:22.713
Then, like a bonehead,
I asked what it would cost
to overhaul her whole body.

16:22.714 --> 16:25.950
Whoa, major faux pas.

16:25.951 --> 16:28.518
Major faux pas...

16:28.519 --> 16:32.389
Was he in the same campaign
as general wow?

16:34.192 --> 16:36.727
Tim, I'm not familiar
with general wow,

16:36.728 --> 16:39.296
But your situation reminds me
of <i>the naked ape.</i>

16:39.297 --> 16:42.232
<i>(grunts)</i>

16:42.233 --> 16:44.201
That is the one exactly, tim.

16:44.202 --> 16:48.772
You see, <i>the naked ape</i>
is a book which theorizes
that men, like apes,

16:48.773 --> 16:51.475
Are instinctively drawn
to younger, more fertile women

16:51.476 --> 16:53.510
In order to propagate
the species.

16:53.511 --> 16:55.679
What's mrs. Naked ape
attracted to?

16:55.680 --> 16:57.881
Unlike the male
of the species,

16:57.882 --> 17:01.551
She instinct is be
attracted to someone older
and more experienced.

17:01.552 --> 17:04.421
Someone with more wisdom,
sensitivity.

17:04.422 --> 17:06.957
Wait a minute.

17:06.958 --> 17:10.828
What you're saying
is if I explain to jill
it was my instincts talking,

17:10.829 --> 17:12.529
I'd be off the hook.

17:12.530 --> 17:15.031
No, no, no, no, tim.

17:15.032 --> 17:17.901
What I'm trying to say
is you have to learn
to understand your instincts,

17:17.902 --> 17:20.470
And then you won't
be on the hook
in the first place.

17:20.471 --> 17:22.940
Oh, yeah, sure.
That'd be good.

17:24.575 --> 17:26.844
Yesterday, we told you how to
take an old beat-up table

17:26.845 --> 17:28.879
And turn it into
fine furniture.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.682
Unfortunately, tim turned it
into less valuable sawdust.

17:33.451 --> 17:36.586
Luckily, al was able
to buy us a new table.

17:36.587 --> 17:38.522
I did not buy this table.

17:38.523 --> 17:39.957
But don't be too surprised

17:39.958 --> 17:43.060
If it shows up
on your credit-card bill.

17:43.061 --> 17:46.130
A lot of us have tables
like this around the house.

17:46.131 --> 17:48.666
A little beat-up, scratches,
stains all over it.

17:48.667 --> 17:51.601
That's right.
So what you wanna do

17:51.602 --> 17:54.437
Is sand it down with
a normal-size sander.

17:54.438 --> 17:57.507
Refinish it,
you'll have yourself
a brand-new table.

17:57.508 --> 17:59.509
I can't do this
to this table.

17:59.510 --> 18:01.679
It's all right, tim.
I'll do it.

18:01.680 --> 18:04.447
No. I am surprised and shocked
that you're so superficial.

18:05.516 --> 18:07.417
What? You're superficial!

18:07.418 --> 18:09.987
Maybe on the surface.

18:12.891 --> 18:15.092
<i>Tool time</i> isn't just about
home improvement.

18:15.093 --> 18:18.128
It's also about
male improvement.

18:18.129 --> 18:20.798
You see, man, by nature,

18:20.799 --> 18:24.267
Is just a naked ape,
chain-smoking salmon.

18:27.072 --> 18:29.239
Our instincts would be
to make this table new,

18:29.240 --> 18:32.275
Make it look new
with plastic filler
in all the nicks.

18:32.276 --> 18:36.680
What we should do is learn to
appreciate the natural beauty
inherent in this wood,

18:36.681 --> 18:40.884
And over the years,
it's become nothing but deeper,
richer and warmer.

18:40.885 --> 18:43.153
And more interesting.

18:43.154 --> 18:44.888
What are you saying, tim?

18:44.889 --> 18:47.791
I'm saying this table
is perfect the way it is.

18:50.195 --> 18:53.097
So our project today
is to stand here
and stare at this table.

18:56.234 --> 18:58.802
No. We could
pour oil on it,

18:58.803 --> 19:02.239
Rub it affectionately
and show the table
how we love it.

19:04.308 --> 19:05.909
Rub with me, al.

19:21.860 --> 19:23.660
I think I got him
cornered.

19:23.661 --> 19:25.796
I think
you're right.

19:25.797 --> 19:27.831
Kiss this game goodbye.

19:30.935 --> 19:32.469
Checkmate.

19:32.470 --> 19:33.737
Goodbye.

19:37.508 --> 19:39.509
The dustpan and broom
are in the closet,

19:39.510 --> 19:42.612
And you know
where the attic is.

19:42.613 --> 19:44.447
Aw, man!

19:44.448 --> 19:47.184
You guys keep losing
to mark, we'll have this
whole house cleaned up.

19:47.185 --> 19:48.852
Dad, do you wanna play chess?

19:48.853 --> 19:51.721
You do not wanna play
your old man in chess.

19:51.722 --> 19:52.856
Why not?

19:52.857 --> 19:56.493
Because I don't know
how to play chess.

19:56.494 --> 20:00.297
Never mind. I'll go and play
with my computer.

20:00.298 --> 20:01.498
Ok.

20:03.601 --> 20:06.636
Hi, mom.
Hi, sweetie.

20:06.637 --> 20:08.638
Hi.
Hi.

20:08.639 --> 20:11.241
Did you watch
<i>tool time</i> today?
No.

20:11.242 --> 20:13.777
Too bad. We had a table on
that reminded me of you.

20:13.778 --> 20:17.314
Why, was it big, flat,
old and dented?

20:17.315 --> 20:19.482
Actually,
it was quite lovely.

20:19.483 --> 20:21.618
Its warmth and color
and character

20:21.619 --> 20:24.221
Made it even more beautiful
than when it was new.

20:24.222 --> 20:26.223
Al wanted to refinish it,

20:26.224 --> 20:30.294
But I really liked that table
just the way it was.

20:36.301 --> 20:40.838
Oh, tim...
It's gorgeous.

20:40.839 --> 20:44.574
Just like you.
It expands in the middle.

20:49.848 --> 20:53.683
Not like you.
It has extra leaves,
so if we have company...

20:53.684 --> 20:55.752
Thank you.

20:58.056 --> 20:59.990
You said you wanted one
for a long time.

20:59.991 --> 21:03.293
No, I don't mean
just thank you
for the table.

21:03.294 --> 21:08.332
I mean, thank you for
listening and understanding
what I was saying.

21:08.333 --> 21:11.335
I had one of
the computer guys at work
help me with that program.

21:11.336 --> 21:14.704
Oh, no.
Oh, come on, come on.
Sit down.

21:17.942 --> 21:21.578
Let's see if I remember.
This is us...

21:27.385 --> 21:29.286
That's us?

21:29.287 --> 21:32.289
That's us in 2446.

21:32.290 --> 21:34.157
So we're, what,
400-some years old?

21:34.158 --> 21:36.493
450 years old.

21:36.494 --> 21:38.461
That's why
we're not movin'.

21:41.266 --> 21:43.300
No matter how paunchy
or wrinkly we get,

21:43.301 --> 21:45.802
We're still
gonna be together
and love each other.

21:48.472 --> 21:51.841
So I guess that just proves
that love is blind.

21:51.842 --> 21:53.176
And there's good news.

21:53.177 --> 21:56.046
Our 425-year-old kids
have finally left the house.

21:58.383 --> 22:01.151
So we can just sit around
naked all day.

22:01.152 --> 22:03.586
No, that is a pretty picture.

22:03.587 --> 22:06.790
Two wrinkled-up old prunes
just lying around together.

22:15.433 --> 22:17.367
Come on, make your move.

22:18.869 --> 22:20.337
I'm working on it.

22:26.311 --> 22:30.080
If chess is too hard for you,
you could go back
to tick-tack-toe.

22:32.050 --> 22:34.351
I'm thinking.

22:34.352 --> 22:37.754
Dad, you've been thinking
for half an hour.

22:37.755 --> 22:40.157
That's a record
for your father.

22:43.694 --> 22:45.662
Eat my dust.

22:50.034 --> 22:51.701
Checkmate.

22:51.702 --> 22:54.004
Dust my house.

23:03.448 --> 23:05.815
We'll show you the process
on these other two tables

23:05.816 --> 23:08.485
That we all bought for $5
at a garage sale.

23:08.486 --> 23:10.720
Actually, I bought them, tim.
You haven't re-bursed me yet.

23:18.529 --> 23:22.032
If chess is too hard for you,
you could go back
to tick-back-toe.
