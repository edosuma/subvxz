00:33.266 --> 00:35.268
Define "violence."

00:35.769 --> 00:37.771
- What?
- Okay, everyone,

00:38.271 --> 00:40.774
I need you to step back.
Step back. Violence. Define it.

00:40.774 --> 00:42.776
I don't know.
Violence?

00:42.776 --> 00:45.779
You're making a movie about it.
Shouldn't you know what it is?

00:45.779 --> 00:48.281
Maybe we should
just get ready.

00:48.281 --> 00:50.784
I'm ready.

00:50.784 --> 00:53.286
All right, silence.

00:53.286 --> 00:55.405
We're going in 20,
here we go.

00:55.405 --> 00:57.407
Try and define it.

00:57.907 --> 00:59.409
Fifteen,
okay, bring it in now.

00:59.909 --> 01:01.411
In my line of work,

01:01.411 --> 01:03.913
if you don't know what
something really is...
ten, nine,

01:04.414 --> 01:06.416
instead of what it looks like,
eight, seven,

01:06.416 --> 01:08.418
you don't mess with it,
six, five,

01:08.418 --> 01:10.420
or you could get
yourself killed.
Four, three,

01:10.420 --> 01:12.922
hold your places, everyone.
That's good.
Two, one.

01:15.925 --> 01:18.928
And cut!

01:18.928 --> 01:21.931
Way to go!

01:21.931 --> 01:25.935
Beautiful.
I think we've got it.
No, no.

01:25.935 --> 01:28.938
We got a problem down here.
Oh, boy.

01:29.439 --> 01:31.441
Get the paramedics
down here immediately.
You're okay.

01:31.941 --> 01:34.828
We have an accident.
Hold on.

02:53.406 --> 02:58.411
Something about that day
reminded me of when I was a kid.

02:59.412 --> 03:01.414
We lived by the sea.
A tiny town.

03:01.915 --> 03:05.668
Lots of fishing boats.
One movie theater.

03:05.668 --> 03:08.171
My brother fished.

03:08.171 --> 03:10.673
I watched movies.

03:10.673 --> 03:14.677
They got me wondering what
we'd do if we were ever attacked.

03:14.677 --> 03:18.681
We suddenly seemed
so vulnerable to killer sharks,
nuclear submarines,

03:18.681 --> 03:21.184
an alien invasion.

03:21.684 --> 03:23.686
The enemy
could come from anywhere.

03:24.687 --> 03:28.191
The land, the water, the sky,
the chinese.

03:30.693 --> 03:33.196
Couldn't trust
any of 'em anymore.

03:33.196 --> 03:36.699
Yeah, Brian.
Mike, I've gone through
the whole thing.

03:36.699 --> 03:38.701
There's absolutely
nothing you can do.

03:38.701 --> 03:41.204
You're telling me
you couldn't find
one loophole?

03:41.204 --> 03:44.707
- I went over it all night.
- Who wrote that contract, Brian?

03:44.707 --> 03:46.709
Look, I can
call Tokyo for you.

03:46.709 --> 03:50.213
No.
Okay.

03:50.713 --> 03:53.216
Guess I've been kinda edgy
ever since.

03:54.717 --> 03:56.719
Looking over my shoulder.

03:58.221 --> 04:02.225
Always ready
for that sudden attack.

04:08.231 --> 04:11.234
- Claire, go ahead.
- Welcome back. How was your flight?

04:13.736 --> 04:17.240
Oshima called from Tokyo.
She said the three million
won't be in the account...

04:17.240 --> 04:19.742
till Friday noon,
our time.

04:19.742 --> 04:21.744
The studio said they are only
releasing the video in June.

04:21.744 --> 04:24.247
You can sue them.
Brian doesn't think you'll win.

04:24.247 --> 04:26.249
Yeah, I know he doesn't.

04:26.249 --> 04:30.753
Listen, I don't want
you to take any more
of Briars fucking calls!

04:33.256 --> 04:37.260
Tell them I gotta
talk to them myself.
It's urgent.

04:59.282 --> 05:01.784
Seeds of violence
got through the night shoot,

05:02.285 --> 05:04.287
but there was an accident
with one of the stunts.

05:04.287 --> 05:09.292
- Cat, the stuntwoman for daisy,
got hurt in the explosion.
- How is she?

05:09.292 --> 05:12.295
She cut her face
and got banged up,
but she's fine.

05:12.295 --> 05:15.298
Did we get the shot?

05:15.298 --> 05:18.301
Yeah, it looks great.

05:18.301 --> 05:20.803
- Great.
- On the other picture
there was a problem.

05:21.304 --> 05:24.807
- The company
was actually evacuated.
- Uh, Claire?

05:24.807 --> 05:26.309
- Yeah?
- I gotta put you on hold.

05:26.309 --> 05:28.561
Okay.

05:33.066 --> 05:36.069
Yeah?
I'm leaving...

05:37.070 --> 05:40.073
where are you going?
You.

05:42.575 --> 05:45.578
What?

05:45.578 --> 05:48.081
I'm leaving you.
Honey.

05:48.081 --> 05:51.584
I can't get your attention
anymore.

05:51.584 --> 05:54.587
I'm not sure I want it.

05:54.587 --> 05:57.590
Where you gonna go?
Guatemala.

05:57.590 --> 06:01.094
- What?
- I was thinking
about guatemala.

06:01.344 --> 06:04.347
Guatemala?
You have a yearning
for squalor?

06:05.465 --> 06:07.467
Life.

06:09.969 --> 06:14.474
I have a yearning for life.
Real life.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.476
Christ, not again.

06:17.977 --> 06:21.481
Paige, look, uh,

06:21.981 --> 06:26.486
I'm coming upstairs.

06:26.486 --> 06:30.990
I'm coming in a minute.
I've been waiting
for this call.

06:41.501 --> 06:43.503
Yeah?
I've got hiyawa on the line.

06:43.503 --> 06:45.505
All right.
Put me through.
It's early morning there.

07:04.023 --> 07:05.525
Look,

07:06.025 --> 07:09.028
my highly overpaid lawyers
are confident we can win
this on three counts.

07:09.028 --> 07:12.532
How can this be possible?
I have to check
with our new york lawyers.

07:12.532 --> 07:15.535
Be my guest.
This will take time.

07:15.535 --> 07:17.537
You have all day.
You'll hear from us.

07:17.537 --> 07:20.540
I look forward to it.

07:28.047 --> 07:31.050
Go ahead, Claire.

07:31.434 --> 07:36.055
Six is here. He wants to know
whether you're gonna use
his title track forviolence.

07:36.055 --> 07:40.560
Yo, Mike.
What's up, baby?
How's that view?

07:40.560 --> 07:43.062
Look, man,
you know my shit is phat.

07:43.062 --> 07:47.066
It's hot, man.
So you gonna be using it
or you gonna be losing it?

07:47.066 --> 07:50.069
Go ahead and show me
the Dailies and you can
put the song on over it.

07:50.069 --> 07:54.073
Okay, one more thing.
Someone dumped a 400-page file
into your e-mail.

07:54.574 --> 07:58.077
Some weird, secret FBI file
with diagrams.

07:58.077 --> 08:01.080
An FBI file in my e-mail?

08:01.080 --> 08:04.584
Yeah, about some new
surveillance system.

08:07.086 --> 08:09.088
That's it?
Nothing from the pope?

08:09.088 --> 08:11.090
Ha ha.
Check it yourself.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.593
Remember we did research on
high-tech crime forviolence?

08:13.593 --> 08:16.095
Anyway, here's the Dailies
and Six's demo track.

08:27.106 --> 08:30.610
You never quite realize
the way things affect you.

08:30.610 --> 08:34.614
When I was a kid movies scared
the shit out of me,

08:34.614 --> 08:37.616
so then when I grew up,

08:37.616 --> 08:40.119
I went into
the movie business.

08:42.121 --> 08:45.625
Turned what you could call
a basic fear of strangers...

08:45.625 --> 08:48.628
into a multimillion-dollar
enterprise.

08:48.628 --> 08:51.631
After all, paranoia
is our number one export.

08:51.764 --> 08:53.766
Everybody needs an enemy.

08:53.766 --> 08:59.772
It's only now I've come
to understand that there are
no enemies or strangers...

08:59.772 --> 09:01.774
just a strange world.

10:29.729 --> 10:31.731
Good morning, guys.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.736
Don't you guys ever sleep?

11:18.277 --> 11:20.279
Hey, Ray.

11:20.279 --> 11:24.283
If you're so smart,
why not try getting a license?
You could drive to work.

11:24.283 --> 11:27.286
Oh, and good morning
to you too.

11:27.286 --> 11:32.291
Truth is, I try
to avoid modern technology
whenever I can.

11:32.291 --> 11:35.795
Hey, you still
want the tr-5 macros
linked to your base matrix?

11:35.795 --> 11:39.799
Do you have them rigged up yet?
What have you been doing
all night?

11:39.799 --> 11:43.803
Just teasing.
See ya.

11:43.803 --> 11:47.807
Dispatch, this is 2-mary-19.
We have a visual on suspects.

11:47.807 --> 11:49.809
10-4, 2-mary-19.

11:49.809 --> 11:54.313
Dispatch, 2-mary-19.
Suspects are being
questioned at location.

11:54.814 --> 11:56.816
10-4, 2-mary-19.

12:27.847 --> 12:31.350
Hey, we'll have another 25 X-rs
going by Friday,

12:31.851 --> 12:34.353
all with the 10-to-500 zooms.

12:34.353 --> 12:36.355
Mmm. Good.

12:36.355 --> 12:39.608
- Trying to keep up with you, Ray.
- You're doing good down there.

12:41.110 --> 12:44.613
- I'll check in with you later.
- We're here.

14:04.944 --> 14:07.947
No, she did not
over-rotate.

14:12.952 --> 14:14.954
Mm-hmm.

14:17.957 --> 14:19.959
Mm-hmm.

14:22.461 --> 14:24.964
The scene? Yeah.

14:26.966 --> 14:30.469
I talked to
the stunt coordinator
and the insurance guy.

14:30.469 --> 14:33.973
They say the whole thing
can be attributed
to our negligence.

14:33.973 --> 14:37.977
She can definitely sue
if she wanted to.
Oh, fuck!

14:38.477 --> 14:41.480
You might want to stop
by the hospital and talk to her
before the meeting.

15:23.022 --> 15:25.524
Oh.

15:49.548 --> 15:52.051
Okay, where is she?
She's right in there.

15:58.057 --> 16:02.061
Wow. Am I delirious, or is
a famous Hollywood producer
coming to visit me?

16:05.564 --> 16:10.069
You're delirious.

16:11.570 --> 16:15.574
Ohh!
You're a pro.

16:16.075 --> 16:18.577
And you're brave.

16:19.078 --> 16:21.580
And you're beautiful.
What's the catch?

16:21.580 --> 16:25.084
A sick sense of humor.

16:25.584 --> 16:29.088
I don't know about that.
I...

16:30.589 --> 16:34.593
- I don't have to answer this.
- Please.

16:37.096 --> 16:39.098
Yeah?
Is this a good time, Mike?

16:39.098 --> 16:41.600
No, I'm coming...
in a minute.
Don't start.

16:41.600 --> 16:45.104
- Go on. It's okay.
- Hang on.

16:45.104 --> 16:47.606
Mm-hmm.

16:50.609 --> 16:52.611
You're the stuff.

16:55.614 --> 16:58.117
- Okay, yes?
- Hey.

16:58.117 --> 17:01.120
I wasn't going
to sue you anyway.

17:04.123 --> 17:07.626
Get out.

17:08.627 --> 17:11.630
Hang on, Brian.
Claire, call Zoltan...

17:11.630 --> 17:14.133
and have 'em screen-test Cat
for the part of the sister.

17:14.133 --> 17:16.635
Cat?
She's a stuntwoman,
not an actress.

17:16.635 --> 17:20.138
Schwarzenegger.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.641
Everybody there? Brian?
Yeah.

17:23.142 --> 17:24.643
You're fired.
What?

17:25.144 --> 17:29.648
Why? Because I don't pay
lawyers to tell me I can't win.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.651
Look, take some time,
wrap it up.

17:32.651 --> 17:34.653
Do me a favor.

17:34.653 --> 17:38.157
Plot your revenge
on your own time.
Mike...

17:38.657 --> 17:40.659
Let's go.

18:15.210 --> 18:18.714
Mike.
Honey, I'm glad
I caught you.

18:18.714 --> 18:21.216
I know we didn't get to talk.
I'm sorry.

18:21.216 --> 18:24.219
I made some reservations...

18:24.219 --> 18:27.723
Mike, I'm losing you.
Hey. Hey. Hey.

18:27.723 --> 18:31.226
Hey! Hey!
Jesus!

18:31.226 --> 18:33.228
What the fuck... hey!

18:33.228 --> 18:35.230
Hey!
Mike?

18:47.493 --> 18:50.496
All right, this is good.
Right here.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.503
Kill him.

18:59.505 --> 19:02.007
Kill him.

19:04.009 --> 19:06.512
You kill him.
Oh, man!

19:08.514 --> 19:10.516
Just kill him.

19:10.516 --> 19:12.518
Yeah?

19:12.518 --> 19:14.520
You just kill him.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.522
Lowell,

19:17.523 --> 19:19.525
kill him... now.

19:19.525 --> 19:21.527
Shit. Thanks
for mentioning my name.

19:21.527 --> 19:24.530
It don't matter if I mention
your stupid, inbred name.

19:24.530 --> 19:27.533
He's about to die.
Now shoot him!

19:27.533 --> 19:29.535
You shoot him.

19:29.535 --> 19:34.540
You don't want
that mercedes anymore?
Yeah, I want it.

19:34.540 --> 19:37.042
Well, if we don't kill him,

19:37.042 --> 19:40.045
they probably won't give us
the money, will they?

19:40.045 --> 19:43.048
And they might
kill us instead.

19:43.048 --> 19:45.050
Do you understand?

19:45.050 --> 19:49.054
We kill him...
we live, plus mercedes.

19:49.054 --> 19:54.059
We don't...
we die, minus mercedes.

19:56.061 --> 19:58.063
You choose.

20:04.069 --> 20:08.073
Lowell, you've got...

20:08.073 --> 20:10.576
five seconds to tell me...

20:10.576 --> 20:13.579
what the fuck
this is really all about.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.081
Five seconds?
I'm not sure I could...

20:16.081 --> 20:18.584
three.
I didn't think
it'd be so hard!

20:19.084 --> 20:21.587
What's hard about it?
Bullshit. Two.

20:21.587 --> 20:23.589
Oh, man, no!
This is it!

20:23.589 --> 20:27.092
It's all gone downill.
Don't you see that?

20:27.092 --> 20:29.595
No. One!
No, no, no!

20:30.095 --> 20:33.098
Fuck! Wait!
All right.

20:33.098 --> 20:35.601
All right, fine.
I'll tell you.

20:38.604 --> 20:40.606
Uh...

20:43.609 --> 20:45.611
Uh...

20:48.113 --> 20:50.115
I like him.

20:50.115 --> 20:52.117
I like him.

20:52.117 --> 20:54.620
What? Who?

20:54.620 --> 20:57.122
Him.

20:57.122 --> 20:59.124
His name's Mike Max.
Remember?

21:01.126 --> 21:05.130
I was talking to him in
the garage while I covered him.

21:05.130 --> 21:08.634
- You were talking to him?
- I'm telling you,
he made some good points.

21:09.134 --> 21:12.137
Max... made good points?

21:12.638 --> 21:15.140
He said we were
wasting our talents...

21:15.140 --> 21:17.142
taking risks that were
not necessary for peanuts.

21:17.142 --> 21:19.144
We had the guts
and the brains to kidnap him.

21:19.645 --> 21:25.150
If we did that,
then there's executive jobs
that we could make fortunes in.

21:25.150 --> 21:27.152
You on fucking drugs again?

21:27.152 --> 21:29.655
I'm telling ya,
he's right.

21:29.655 --> 21:32.157
I mean,
this is going nowhere.

21:32.157 --> 21:34.660
He sussed it.
This guy's amazing.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.662
Think about it now.

21:37.162 --> 21:39.164
You don't wanna
kill him.

21:39.665 --> 21:42.167
I don't wanna
kill him.

21:42.167 --> 21:46.672
Maybe there's some other way
we can enter the 20th century
driving a mercedes.

21:46.672 --> 21:50.175
I am not going back
to stealing!

21:50.676 --> 21:52.678
Maybe there's other stuff
we could do.

21:52.678 --> 21:55.681
What other stuff?
I don't know.
Something.

21:56.181 --> 21:58.684
Some... business.

21:58.684 --> 22:01.687
We could go into business,
maybe.

22:01.687 --> 22:04.690
Maybe... maybe
the entertainment business.

22:10.696 --> 22:12.698
The what?

22:14.700 --> 22:18.203
Now I've fucking heard
everything!

22:18.203 --> 22:21.206
Shh! Shh!
Keep it down.

22:21.206 --> 22:25.210
First you talk
to the hostage.

22:25.210 --> 22:28.714
Then you renege
on your part.

22:28.714 --> 22:32.334
And now,
now you wanna go...

22:32.334 --> 22:35.337
into the entertainment
business!

22:49.985 --> 22:53.989
What kind of bullshit
you been telling him?

22:53.989 --> 22:55.991
It's not bullshit.

22:55.991 --> 23:00.495
- He produced your favorite movie.
- It's true.

23:00.495 --> 23:02.497
It happens
to be my favorite too.

23:05.500 --> 23:09.504
In my pocket...
is my card.

23:11.506 --> 23:17.012
You have your what?

23:17.012 --> 23:19.514
Your...
your card? Huh?

23:19.514 --> 23:22.017
You want me to take
your fucking card?

23:22.017 --> 23:25.020
- You dipshit, slimy,
no-good little weasel!
- Frank... no.

23:25.520 --> 23:28.523
Huh? Huh?
Let me give you
my business card.

23:28.523 --> 23:34.029
You know what you can both do
with your stupid, stinking,
fucking entertainment business?

23:34.029 --> 23:36.031
Jesus, Frank, no!

23:36.031 --> 23:38.033
I want to give you...

23:38.033 --> 23:41.036
a million bucks...

23:41.036 --> 23:43.038
in points.

23:45.540 --> 23:48.543
Points!

23:48.543 --> 23:51.546
What the hell's "points" mean?

23:51.546 --> 23:55.050
It means a piece
of the profits.

23:55.050 --> 23:59.054
It means...
a percentage.

23:59.054 --> 24:02.057
It means percentage!

24:02.557 --> 24:05.060
When was the last time
somebody gave you percentage?

24:06.561 --> 24:08.063
Shut up, Lowell,

24:08.563 --> 24:10.065
or I will torture you.

24:10.565 --> 24:12.567
Never is when.

24:13.068 --> 24:14.569
Never did, never will.

24:19.574 --> 24:23.078
Come over here.
Come over here.

24:28.083 --> 24:30.085
One more...

24:30.085 --> 24:32.587
fucking chirp,

24:32.587 --> 24:36.091
and there's gonna be
a percentage of your carcass...

24:36.091 --> 24:38.593
all over this hill!

25:09.624 --> 25:11.126
Hi, Ray.

25:12.627 --> 25:15.130
Didn't think
I'd find you there so late.

25:15.630 --> 25:19.634
Anyway, I'm finally sending you
a cleaning lady... mathilda.

25:20.135 --> 25:22.637
She'll start tomorrow.
She's from salvador.

25:23.638 --> 25:26.641
She passed security.

25:26.641 --> 25:29.144
Speaks five words of english,
badly.

25:29.144 --> 25:32.147
Her family was wiped out
by the death squads,

25:32.147 --> 25:35.150
except for
her little daughter.

25:35.150 --> 25:38.653
They have you working late
at nasa every night like this?

25:39.154 --> 25:41.656
Yeah. Um,
why don't you, uh...

25:42.657 --> 25:44.659
why don't you
send her over?

25:46.161 --> 25:48.163
Okay.

25:50.665 --> 25:52.167
Get some sleep.

26:06.181 --> 26:08.683
What the fuck?

26:16.057 --> 26:19.060
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

26:21.062 --> 26:26.067
So dark and empty, with spikes
in the aing and the room
so small it sweats.

26:26.067 --> 26:28.570
But I know it's no different
on the street,

26:29.070 --> 26:32.073
except if you get shot,
be one of them
lucky victims you can see.

26:32.073 --> 26:36.077
"Drive by. Drive by."
Everybody love to say it.

26:36.077 --> 26:39.080
But when you're in that room
you can lie there, play dead,

26:39.080 --> 26:41.082
stand up on your head.

26:41.082 --> 26:44.586
Make no difference.
Daddy don't go by.

26:45.086 --> 26:48.590
He comes inside.
He comes right in.

26:48.590 --> 26:50.592
After a hard day
at whittier,

26:51.092 --> 26:56.097
he comes all the way
inside that room,
that bed, my pajamas.

26:56.598 --> 26:59.601
He comes all the way
inside my room,
and he don't stop there.

26:59.601 --> 27:02.604
He goes inside my crack,
and he don't stop there.

27:02.604 --> 27:07.108
He keeps going, tearing
everything apart while he
makes them sweet loving sounds,

27:07.108 --> 27:09.110
and he don't stop there.

27:09.110 --> 27:13.114
He calls me names so hard
and bad it hurts my heart
more than it hurts my crack,

27:13.114 --> 27:15.116
and he don't stop there.

27:16.117 --> 27:18.620
See, he's lookir
for my soul.

27:18.620 --> 27:21.623
Everything they took from him
he wanted back.

27:22.123 --> 27:24.125
He's starving for it,

27:24.125 --> 27:26.628
starving so bad
he'd kill me for it.

27:26.628 --> 27:29.631
But I don't want to die.

27:29.631 --> 27:31.633
I don't want to die.

27:31.633 --> 27:34.135
I don't want to die.

27:34.135 --> 27:38.139
So I flip the script,
trick the dick and make him
think he got it all.

27:38.640 --> 27:42.644
I make him think he got it all.
Make him think he got it all.

27:42.644 --> 27:45.647
And I slip away inside my head
and visit...

27:45.647 --> 27:49.150
the princess of beverly hills.

27:50.151 --> 27:53.655
Haing blond, eyes green,

27:54.155 --> 27:56.658
painting her fingernails
like jellybeans,

27:57.158 --> 27:59.160
vanilla skin shimmering.

27:59.160 --> 28:02.163
She don't even notice
when I slip inside her soul...

28:02.163 --> 28:05.166
like a ghost
in a crystal palace.

28:05.166 --> 28:09.170
I be all up in there eating
sugar cakes and bonbons and...

28:10.171 --> 28:13.174
she don't even notice me
while I'm inside her soul.

28:14.676 --> 28:18.179
See, she ain't never
needed to know
she needed a soul.

28:18.680 --> 28:21.683
# Don't even know
she got one #

28:23.685 --> 28:26.187
and I watch her...
I'm so close...

28:26.187 --> 28:29.190
while her fingernails dry.

28:29.190 --> 28:32.694
And the princess,
she don't feel a thing.

28:33.194 --> 28:36.698
She can't smell
the burning knife
that's splitting me in half.

28:36.698 --> 28:41.202
One time, I think,
she smiled at me,
I think she saved my life.

28:41.202 --> 28:44.706
And now...

28:46.708 --> 28:48.710
it's over...

28:49.711 --> 28:51.713
and daddy start to cry.

28:53.715 --> 28:57.719
We go walking and talkir
in macan'thur park,

28:57.719 --> 29:01.222
and I forgive him sometimes.

29:01.222 --> 29:03.725
The princess
of beverly hills...

29:04.225 --> 29:06.227
I don't need her soul
no more.

29:08.730 --> 29:10.732
I give her back to you.

29:36.257 --> 29:37.759
I, uh...

29:41.763 --> 29:43.765
I never knew
my father.

29:45.767 --> 29:48.269
Transition to the southbound
side of the santa ana freeway.

29:48.770 --> 29:51.773
Disabled big rig in
the left lane. Backed up
to the pasadena freeway.

29:51.773 --> 29:54.776
Montebello, a sig alert
for the 60 eastbound at finley.

29:54.776 --> 29:56.778
The freeway's still closed
because of an accident.

29:57.278 --> 30:00.281
What is the point
of you having a phone...

30:00.281 --> 30:03.284
if you don't answer it?

30:12.794 --> 30:15.797
What the hell
are you doing here?

30:15.797 --> 30:18.299
Yesterday,
ten days, any days.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.301
You never...

30:20.802 --> 30:23.805
you didn't send me my...

30:25.306 --> 30:27.308
I know, dad.

30:28.309 --> 30:30.311
What should I do?

30:34.816 --> 30:38.319
What is your dad for?

30:39.320 --> 30:41.322
Hmm?

30:42.824 --> 30:47.328
Dad, I wish
you'd answer the phone.

30:48.329 --> 30:50.331
It's important for me...

30:50.331 --> 30:52.333
that I know
that you're okay.

30:54.335 --> 30:56.337
All right, okay.
I'll buy that.

30:56.337 --> 30:58.339
Okay, good.
I got your favorite.

31:00.842 --> 31:04.345
Pepperoni.
You first.

31:04.846 --> 31:06.848
Go ahead.

31:09.851 --> 31:11.352
Mmm.

31:21.362 --> 31:24.365
Oh, I'm tired.

31:28.369 --> 31:30.872
You know,

31:31.873 --> 31:33.875
I was right, dad.

31:35.877 --> 31:39.380
I was more right than
I could ever have imagined.

31:51.025 --> 31:52.527
Give me a second.
I'll call it back in.

31:53.027 --> 31:55.029
We already checked it out.
We didn't find nothing.

31:55.029 --> 31:58.032
Oh, man. Jeez.

31:58.032 --> 32:00.034
Yeah, they're, uh...

32:01.536 --> 32:03.538
they were blown off.

32:03.538 --> 32:07.542
Shotgun, three feet.
Uninged, clean at
the cortex.

32:08.042 --> 32:11.546
That one, two feet max,
between the cerebellum
and the frontal lobe.

32:11.546 --> 32:14.048
Yeah, what'd I say?
Headless.

32:15.049 --> 32:17.051
I heard they I.D.'d
the killer.

32:17.418 --> 32:21.422
See, that's where I took
the liberty of saying
"only in Hollywood."

32:21.923 --> 32:25.426
So the killer's
a deranged hooker?

32:26.427 --> 32:28.930
No, he was a regular guy.
Uh-huh.

32:28.930 --> 32:30.932
Just liked to kill
on the weekends.

32:30.932 --> 32:33.935
Nope, no record
of his killing
on weekends.

32:33.935 --> 32:35.937
MacDermot, come on.
Be a little more creative.

32:35.937 --> 32:39.941
There's two people dead here.
You guys are a little cynical,
aren't you?

32:40.441 --> 32:42.443
Okay,
here's the spin.

32:42.944 --> 32:45.947
The gentleman in question,
the apparent killer,

32:45.947 --> 32:48.449
was, in fact,
originally the victim.

32:48.449 --> 32:50.952
You got that?
The killer was
the kidnap victim...

32:50.952 --> 32:54.455
who was brought here
by these two
now-headless kidnappers,

32:54.956 --> 32:58.459
a Mr. Lowell Lewis
and a Mr. Frank Cray,

32:58.459 --> 33:01.462
and during
an apparent altercation
between the two of them,

33:01.462 --> 33:06.968
said victim, Mr. Michael Max,
the guy they carjacked
in that mercedes there,

33:06.968 --> 33:09.971
freed himself
and blew both theing heads off.

33:10.471 --> 33:13.474
Wait a minute.
Michael Max...
Mike Max the producer?

33:17.478 --> 33:19.480
I know who this guy is.

33:19.480 --> 33:22.984
This guy's great.
Did you see creative killing?

33:22.984 --> 33:25.987
What is the other one...
odd sudden death.

33:25.987 --> 33:28.990
You see odd sudden death?
He's great.
Yeah, yeah.

33:28.990 --> 33:30.992
This is very, uh, uh...

33:30.992 --> 33:34.495
it's, like,
very realistic action,
murder, real crime-type stuff.

33:34.495 --> 33:37.999
Is that his car?
Let me go check out his car.

33:37.999 --> 33:40.001
We have a film buff,
MacDermot.

33:42.754 --> 33:44.255
I'm Ruby.

33:47.759 --> 33:49.761
I'm Ruby.

33:51.262 --> 33:53.264
Hi. I'm Ruby.

33:55.266 --> 33:57.769
Uh, what now?

34:03.775 --> 34:05.777
I want to fuck you.

34:06.778 --> 34:09.781
Can I do my line first?

34:10.782 --> 34:12.784
Sure.

34:12.784 --> 34:16.286
- Great. What is it?
- "I want to fuck you."

34:17.789 --> 34:21.292
I'm sorry.
I thought... good.

34:21.292 --> 34:24.295
Very good.

34:24.295 --> 34:26.297
Um...

34:26.297 --> 34:29.801
I don't remember that line
from my script.

34:31.803 --> 34:37.308
"Ruby: Hi. I'm Ruby.
I want to fuck you."

34:37.809 --> 34:40.812
"Jack: Well,
that's very honest.

34:40.812 --> 34:44.815
- I want to fuck you too."
- You're joking.

34:45.315 --> 34:49.821
No. This part is bad
on purpose, just like
a cheap porno movie.

34:49.821 --> 34:52.824
And then, all of a sudden,
it gets good.

34:52.824 --> 34:55.326
That's the trick.

34:55.326 --> 34:57.829
Oh, so that's
the trick.

34:57.829 --> 34:59.831
That's the trick.

35:01.332 --> 35:04.836
Maybe Mike was right.
She can do it, but...

35:04.836 --> 35:09.340
she doesn't work
for another month.
It'll be fine.

35:11.843 --> 35:13.845
Are you still rolling?

35:25.106 --> 35:27.608
You must be mathilda.
Si, gentleman.

35:27.608 --> 35:30.611
...florinda.

36:42.183 --> 36:45.186
El hospital?
No. No.
No hospital.

36:49.190 --> 36:51.692
No.
No, not the house.

36:51.692 --> 36:54.195
- Senor...
- Hmm?

37:09.594 --> 37:13.097
Maybe I jinxed him.
Who?

37:13.097 --> 37:15.099
Weren't you gonna ask me
about Mike?

37:15.600 --> 37:17.101
I was just
building up to it.

37:17.602 --> 37:20.104
You're a pretty slow
builder.

37:20.104 --> 37:22.106
I was gonna say...

37:22.106 --> 37:25.109
here we are,
studios.

37:25.109 --> 37:27.612
You're beautiful.

37:27.612 --> 37:30.615
Movies, murder.

37:30.615 --> 37:33.618
I was gonna segue
into it from there.
Crafty.

37:33.618 --> 37:37.622
Med school.
Clinical psych.
Hmm.

37:37.622 --> 37:41.626
I was always curious...
why people do what they do.

37:41.626 --> 37:46.130
And now, who cares?
You just wanna
find your man.

37:46.130 --> 37:49.133
No, I wanna find my woman,
marry, settle down.

37:50.635 --> 37:53.137
I wanna find my man first,
I guess.

37:53.137 --> 37:55.640
Unless my man turns out
to be a woman.

37:55.640 --> 37:59.644
Better than if your woman
turns out to be a man, I suppose.

38:00.144 --> 38:02.647
You know, you have
an interesting approach, Doc.

38:02.647 --> 38:07.652
We have barely spoken,
and yet I feel I could be
a murder suspect or a fiancee.

38:10.154 --> 38:12.156
Sorry.
No offense.

38:12.156 --> 38:17.662
# 'Cause I'd miss you
forever #
you could be.

38:17.662 --> 38:23.167
# So love me right now #
I'd better get this
back to wardrobe.

38:23.167 --> 38:27.171
# For it won't last #

38:27.171 --> 38:30.174
hey, you're a cop.

38:30.174 --> 38:32.176
Define "violence."

38:34.679 --> 38:40.184
# 'Cause I'd miss you forever #
uh, fear, absence of love,
emotional revenge.

38:40.184 --> 38:44.188
# Every time #

38:45.690 --> 38:50.194
# every time #

38:51.696 --> 38:53.197
# every #
hmm.

39:07.094 --> 39:09.597
What the hell
are you doing?

39:09.597 --> 39:12.600
Do you realize
what you've just
thrown away?

39:14.101 --> 39:16.604
Little things around here
have big importance.
Do you understand?

39:17.104 --> 39:20.608
Big importance.
Mucho importante.
Importante! Understand?

39:20.608 --> 39:24.111
I can't have people around here
who don't know what's what.

39:26.614 --> 39:30.117
Then again,
I can't afford
people who do.

39:43.130 --> 39:45.132
You cannot stay here.

39:45.132 --> 39:48.135
Not possible here.
Understand?

39:48.135 --> 39:50.137
You must stay outside.

39:51.639 --> 39:54.642
Yes? Thank you.

40:00.147 --> 40:04.151
That girl can never
be allowed in here
under any circumstances.

40:04.151 --> 40:07.154
Do you understand that?
Never.

40:12.660 --> 40:14.662
Okay.

40:14.662 --> 40:17.164
Here... no.

40:18.165 --> 40:21.168
There... si.

40:21.168 --> 40:25.673
Comprende?
Si, gentleman.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.675
Good.

41:10.217 --> 41:11.719
No.

41:12.219 --> 41:13.721
Mike's discovered
a lot of people.

41:14.221 --> 41:16.841
He sees something in them
no one else sees.

41:16.841 --> 41:18.843
He believes in them.

41:18.843 --> 41:20.845
His love is like a rocket...

41:20.845 --> 41:25.349
it blasts you forward
into your future,
into your destiny.

41:25.349 --> 41:27.351
But no matter who you are,
sooner or later,

41:27.351 --> 41:32.356
you wake up in
your shiny new rocket...
alone...

41:32.356 --> 41:35.359
and realize
he's in the cockpit,
and he has the keys.

41:38.362 --> 41:40.364
The view is amazing.

41:42.366 --> 41:44.869
But somewhere
in the back of your mind,

41:44.869 --> 41:47.371
you can hear
the crash coming,

41:47.371 --> 41:51.876
somewhere, somehow,
anytime.

41:53.878 --> 41:55.880
Some people
don't like that feeling.

41:57.381 --> 42:01.385
I suppose everyone's
wanted to kill him
at some point.

42:02.386 --> 42:04.388
I know I have.

42:07.892 --> 42:09.894
Do you think
he's still alive?

42:09.894 --> 42:13.397
Absolutely.
But I'm an optimist.

42:14.899 --> 42:18.903
I mean, there's no evidence
that he's dead.
Maybe he's in shock.

42:18.903 --> 42:21.405
Maybe he's unable
to communicate,
for one reason or another.

42:25.409 --> 42:27.411
Do you think...

42:29.914 --> 42:33.918
feelings, intentions,
bad thoughts...

42:35.419 --> 42:38.923
can have an effect
on reality, like,

42:38.923 --> 42:41.425
sort of...

42:41.926 --> 42:43.928
unintentional prayers?

42:43.928 --> 42:47.431
Definitely. I think
everything's connected.

42:47.431 --> 42:49.934
Did you know that
in nuclear physics,

42:49.934 --> 42:52.937
if you just look at
a so-called particle,
you change it?

42:53.437 --> 42:57.942
Imagine, just by looking
at something you can actually
change what it is.

42:57.942 --> 42:59.944
Sometimes you can even
destroy it.

42:59.944 --> 43:02.947
It's like turning on the light
to see the darkness.

43:04.448 --> 43:06.450
We know what we look at
can change us. Take me.

43:06.450 --> 43:09.954
One of the main reasons
I'm standing here is because
of your husband's movies.

43:09.954 --> 43:12.957
Now I'm here fighting crime,
and he's a victim of it.

43:13.457 --> 43:15.960
We're connected,
and we never even met.

43:15.960 --> 43:20.464
God only knows the amount
of subnuclear transference
that goes on in a marriage.

43:20.464 --> 43:22.967
It's almost incalculable.
Why do you ask?

43:37.982 --> 43:39.984
No, no.

43:58.752 --> 44:01.255
I didn't know where I was,

44:01.255 --> 44:03.257
but I knew I was alive.

44:06.260 --> 44:10.764
There's nothing quite like
a couple of killers
with a shotgun at your head...

44:10.764 --> 44:12.766
to make you pay attention.

44:15.269 --> 44:19.273
But seeing
theing heads blown off
instead of mine,

44:19.273 --> 44:21.775
like toy targets exploding,

44:23.277 --> 44:26.280
that's the part
that scared me the most.

44:38.292 --> 44:41.295
You can wash up
over here.

45:00.314 --> 45:02.316
Buenos dias.

45:02.449 --> 45:05.452
Buenos dias.

45:21.468 --> 45:23.971
I wanted to tell Paige...

45:23.971 --> 45:26.974
"a couple
of killers changed me.

45:26.974 --> 45:28.976
"They made your point.

45:29.476 --> 45:32.980
And a bunch of gardeners
saved my life."

45:32.980 --> 45:34.982
But something told me...

45:35.099 --> 45:38.102
I might never get
the chance to tell her.

45:38.102 --> 45:40.104
Maybe what they say
is true.

45:41.605 --> 45:44.108
You never can
go home again.

46:12.019 --> 46:15.022
- Hey, filipe. Catch.
- Huh?

46:30.037 --> 46:32.039
Gracias.

46:32.039 --> 46:34.041
Silencio, por favor.

46:53.060 --> 46:58.565
Mike.

47:02.069 --> 47:05.572
- Amen.
- Amen.

47:05.572 --> 47:08.075
Amen.

47:09.576 --> 47:11.078
Ahora.

47:14.081 --> 47:17.084
Mike, can you help me
with my homework tonight?

47:20.587 --> 47:22.589
Come on.

47:22.589 --> 47:24.591
Are you gonna come
fishing with us on sunday?

47:24.591 --> 47:26.593
It's our favorite thing
to do.

47:26.593 --> 47:28.595
I like it too.

47:31.598 --> 47:33.600
I'm not turning over
his computer.

47:33.600 --> 47:36.603
- Can you use it?
- No, I don't know how to use it.

47:36.603 --> 47:41.108
That's the last thing I want.
Then I'll come by
to pick it up, okay?

47:41.108 --> 47:43.110
Don't push me.
You're trying
to be difficult.

47:43.110 --> 47:45.612
I'm not trying
to be difficult.
I'm sorry.

47:45.612 --> 47:47.614
But sooner or later,
you're gonna have to get
your head out of the sand...

47:48.115 --> 47:50.617
and start dealing
with this.

47:51.118 --> 47:52.619
Hang on, Paige.

47:53.120 --> 47:57.624
Six just came up from
the recording studio.
He wants to tell you something.

47:58.125 --> 48:00.127
Yo, madam Max.

48:00.127 --> 48:03.130
I'm supposed to tell you to
hand over the computer...

48:03.130 --> 48:05.632
and cooperate
with the powers that be,

48:05.632 --> 48:09.136
but you know that's
not exactly my style.

48:09.136 --> 48:13.640
I say just take your
own sweet time, madam Max.

48:13.640 --> 48:17.644
It's a cold world out here,
even in the sun.

48:19.146 --> 48:21.148
You're a beautiful lady.

48:21.148 --> 48:23.150
You stay warm.

48:23.150 --> 48:25.152
Thanks, Six.

49:30.717 --> 49:33.220
Well, yeah,
you can see down there
from here,

49:33.220 --> 49:36.723
which means they could've
shot 'em from up here, yeah.

49:37.224 --> 49:39.726
But they were headless corpses,
remember?

49:39.726 --> 49:41.728
I don't think you can
blow heads off
from 300 yards.

49:41.728 --> 49:45.732
- That's like three
football fields, right?
- All right.

49:45.732 --> 49:47.734
The coroner said the recovered
skull fragments...

49:48.235 --> 49:50.737
were in a state of critically
infarcted bifurcation,

49:51.238 --> 49:53.740
meaning all the bone
was thoroughly shattered,

49:53.740 --> 49:58.245
meaning the bullets
could have been high-density,
army-style splinter shot,

49:58.245 --> 50:02.749
which can be fired
from three feet or 3,000 feet
with the same effect.

50:02.749 --> 50:04.751
See what I'm saying?

50:04.751 --> 50:07.754
Get outta here.
You play too many
video games, kid.

50:07.754 --> 50:11.758
You think maybe low-flying
F-16 fighters shot 'em, huh?

50:11.758 --> 50:14.761
Like I said,
only in Hollywood.

50:14.761 --> 50:16.763
Can't be coffee
and danish.

50:16.763 --> 50:20.767
Has to be cappuccino
or that thick, creamy stuff,
that italian thing...

50:20.767 --> 50:22.769
what is that?
Tiramisu.

50:23.270 --> 50:24.771
- Tiramisu.
- Well, whatever.

50:25.272 --> 50:27.274
Anyway,
this Michael Max,

50:27.274 --> 50:30.277
he looks to me
like one of these guys that'd
have his own murder catered...

50:30.277 --> 50:34.281
gentlemen, Michael Max
is a very innovative guy.

50:34.781 --> 50:37.284
If he's gonna do something,
he's gonna do it first,

50:37.284 --> 50:39.786
and he's gonna do it big,
he's gonna do it right.

50:39.786 --> 50:42.789
That's exactly why somebody
probably wanted him dead.

50:44.291 --> 50:47.294
I'd say someone
very professional,
obviously...

50:48.795 --> 50:51.298
and very paranoid.

50:51.798 --> 50:53.800
I don't exactly understand
what I just did for you.

50:54.301 --> 50:57.804
It's okay. I'm just
trying to debug
a little number here.

50:57.804 --> 51:00.807
So, uh...
so, thanks.

51:00.807 --> 51:03.810
You're the wizard.

51:03.810 --> 51:06.813
Well, I guess I'd better
head back to the shop.

51:07.314 --> 51:09.316
Okay. See you.
See you.

51:37.094 --> 51:39.096
Look. Two more.

51:39.096 --> 51:43.600
They gotta be feds.
Still waiting
for me to come home.

51:47.604 --> 51:51.108
Yeah?
Maybe you should
turn yourself in, eh?

51:51.108 --> 51:53.610
You're wasting
my tax dollars, hombre.

51:53.610 --> 51:55.729
Hey, hey.

52:18.385 --> 52:20.387
Come through for me, baby.

52:20.887 --> 52:22.889
Yes, baby.

52:23.390 --> 52:26.393
Yes.
Come through for me.

52:26.893 --> 52:29.896
There they are.

52:30.897 --> 52:32.899
Yes.

52:34.401 --> 52:37.904
Fucking clouds.

52:40.907 --> 52:42.909
Progress...

52:42.909 --> 52:45.412
twenty seconds.

52:49.416 --> 52:51.418
Oh, my god.

53:02.295 --> 53:04.798
Do you think
they're watching us?

53:04.798 --> 53:07.300
What?

53:07.300 --> 53:11.805
Do you think
they're watching us?

53:16.810 --> 53:19.312
It'll be all right,
hombre.
Yeah?

53:19.312 --> 53:21.314
We'll feed you good.

53:21.314 --> 53:25.318
We'll feed youcocido,
menudo, carnitas, pozole.

53:25.318 --> 53:29.322
Sounds good.

54:03.240 --> 54:05.242
Wait.

54:10.247 --> 54:12.249
Wait.

54:22.259 --> 54:24.261
I never...

54:24.261 --> 54:26.263
I never noticed.

55:31.828 --> 55:33.830
Hey.

55:33.830 --> 55:35.832
Two questions.

55:35.832 --> 55:39.836
Are you here
to do something bad
with our father?

55:39.836 --> 55:43.340
No.

55:45.842 --> 55:48.345
Are you the guy
in the newspapers?

55:52.849 --> 55:55.852
Yeah, I am.
But don't tell anybody.

55:56.853 --> 56:00.857
I told you.
Now pay up.

56:00.857 --> 56:03.360
Yeah!

56:03.360 --> 56:06.363
Some friend.
Sorry about that.

56:06.363 --> 56:10.367
It's okay.
Good night.

56:10.367 --> 56:12.369
Yeah.

56:12.369 --> 56:14.371
Good night.

56:24.381 --> 56:26.383
I still love my wife...

56:27.884 --> 56:29.886
so much.

56:30.887 --> 56:32.889
Senora, there are
three gentlemens.

56:32.889 --> 56:34.891
Let them wait.

56:34.891 --> 56:38.395
I always did,
even when I made her suffer,

56:38.395 --> 56:41.898
on purpose,
for long periods of time,

56:41.898 --> 56:44.401
and enjoyed it perversely.

56:54.411 --> 56:56.413
"Perversely."

56:56.413 --> 56:59.416
That's one thing
I think I can define now.

56:59.416 --> 57:03.920
It's when things
are upside-down and you start
to like 'em that way.

57:06.923 --> 57:08.925
Oh.

57:25.058 --> 57:27.060
Hey,
you got your phone?

57:36.569 --> 57:38.571
You talk to him.

57:43.076 --> 57:45.078
Six. What's up?

57:45.078 --> 57:47.580
He's got to change.
You have to change.

57:47.580 --> 57:50.583
What? Who this?

57:50.583 --> 57:53.586
I'm a friend
who you don't know yet.

57:53.586 --> 57:55.588
Oh, shit.
I know all my friends.

57:55.588 --> 58:00.093
Oh, I'm an amigo,
closer than you think.

58:00.093 --> 58:02.595
There's a message
I must give you.
There's no time.

58:03.096 --> 58:05.098
You must change.
"Gangsta" rap is dying.

58:05.098 --> 58:07.100
What the fuck
are you talking about?

58:07.600 --> 58:11.104
- Violence is dead.
- No, no, no, no, no.

58:11.104 --> 58:14.607
Let me tell you something,
friend. Violence is
bigger than ever.

58:14.607 --> 58:19.612
You see, little baby white girls
be piercing every floppy piece
of skin they got,

58:19.612 --> 58:22.115
creaming to every flavor
of gangsta.

58:22.115 --> 58:26.119
Pretty soon records
just gonna have the sound
of gunshots on 'em.

58:26.119 --> 58:30.623
Everywhere you look,
billboards got some movie star
holding some big-ass gun.

58:30.623 --> 58:33.626
Let me tell you something,
motherfucker.

58:33.626 --> 58:37.130
Violence rules, man.
Violence is flip.

58:37.130 --> 58:39.632
You don't like it,
run with the nuns,
but it is here,

58:39.632 --> 58:41.634
it is now,
and Six is on it.

58:49.142 --> 58:51.144
Brian.

58:53.146 --> 58:55.148
Hello, Paige.

58:59.152 --> 59:03.156
This is Terry Gromer, president,
music and movies divisions.

59:05.158 --> 59:08.661
And Ian Whitley,
your head of business affairs.

59:14.167 --> 59:16.169
Hello, gentlemen.

59:20.173 --> 59:22.175
You can smoke, Brian.

59:24.677 --> 59:26.679
Thanks.

59:27.180 --> 59:29.682
Champagne? Coffee?

59:29.682 --> 59:33.686
I feel like
I've grown very close
to you in this short time.

59:40.193 --> 59:44.197
But now I'm about
to do something that
I think is important...

59:45.198 --> 59:47.200
but it is risky.

59:52.205 --> 59:54.207
Just in case
anything happens to me,

59:54.207 --> 59:58.711
I just wanted to say
thank you and adios.

59:58.711 --> 01:00:00.713
Que?
Que?

01:00:06.219 --> 01:00:08.221
Si, vamos!
"Vamos."

01:00:30.457 --> 01:00:33.460
- How you doing?
- Hi, ramon.
Take any station.

01:00:36.463 --> 01:00:39.466
Maybe it'll look better
with colored paper.
Yeah, I guess.

01:00:41.968 --> 01:00:43.970
Hi.
Hi.

01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:45.972
Do you have
any work station
that's available?

01:00:45.972 --> 01:00:48.975
Did you check in?
Got a friend
taking care of it.

01:00:48.975 --> 01:00:51.478
Great.
How about this one?

01:00:53.980 --> 01:00:56.483
Okay.

01:00:56.483 --> 01:00:59.486
Excuse me.
Can you help me?
Just a second.

01:00:59.486 --> 01:01:02.489
In a minute.
He's fine.
He can take care of himself.

01:01:27.013 --> 01:01:30.016
The thing about
sudden attack is...

01:01:30.016 --> 01:01:33.520
you never know
where it's coming from.

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:36.523
But it's usually not
from where you expect it,

01:01:36.523 --> 01:01:38.525
unless you expect it
from everywhere,

01:01:38.525 --> 01:01:41.027
which makes you paranoid.

01:01:48.034 --> 01:01:51.538
Mike, you'll probably
never get this.

01:01:51.538 --> 01:01:53.540
The FBI's
been all over everything.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:57.544
But if you're out there...
this is very strange.

01:01:57.544 --> 01:02:01.548
A guy called you.
He wanted to talk
to you very urgently.

01:02:01.548 --> 01:02:06.052
He asked me whether you'd
had a chance to read the file
he sent you on e-mail.

01:02:06.553 --> 01:02:10.056
He sounded scared.
He didn't want to leave
his name or number.

01:02:10.056 --> 01:02:13.059
He insisted that
you would know
how to reach him.

01:02:13.059 --> 01:02:17.063
Apparently you met
at the technology fair
in florida last year.

01:02:17.063 --> 01:02:20.567
He said
you liked each other.

01:02:20.567 --> 01:02:26.072
I hope this means
something to you,
and I hope you're alive.

01:02:30.076 --> 01:02:32.078
Ramon, jose.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.082
Let's go.

01:02:49.095 --> 01:02:51.097
Let's just
get out of here.

01:02:52.599 --> 01:02:55.101
Okay, amigo.
Come on.

01:02:55.101 --> 01:02:58.104
- Out of the way, ma'am.
- What?

01:02:59.606 --> 01:03:02.609
Oh, shit.
Ramors got the keys.

01:03:02.609 --> 01:03:05.111
That's all the locks.

01:03:05.111 --> 01:03:07.614
Securing the back entrance?
Is that all you need?

01:03:10.116 --> 01:03:12.118
Gracias.

01:03:12.619 --> 01:03:14.120
Vamanos, vamanos, vamanos.

01:03:16.122 --> 01:03:18.625
Under control.

01:03:25.632 --> 01:03:27.634
All right,
let's get outta here.

01:03:34.140 --> 01:03:37.143
What are we looking for?
I don't know.

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:47.403
That was...
that was orion.

01:03:47.403 --> 01:03:49.906
This one is taurus.

01:03:51.407 --> 01:03:56.913
If you look really close,
you can see
the shape of a bull.

01:03:56.913 --> 01:04:00.416
Wow. Which one
did you go to?

01:04:00.416 --> 01:04:02.418
I didn't go
to the stars.

01:04:02.418 --> 01:04:05.421
I just helped build
one of these
big telescopes...

01:04:05.922 --> 01:04:07.924
so we can
see them better.

01:04:09.425 --> 01:04:11.427
My daddy's up there.

01:04:12.929 --> 01:04:15.431
It'd be nice
if we could see him.

01:04:17.934 --> 01:04:20.937
But I guess
we can't always
have what we want.

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:07.043
Hey, Paige.
Hi, Six.

01:06:07.043 --> 01:06:09.545
Bad time?
No, I was just reading.

01:06:09.545 --> 01:06:12.548
I thought I heard something.
It gets kinda spooky
up here sometimes.

01:06:12.548 --> 01:06:15.551
You seem tense.
Oh, no, I'm fine,
I'm fine.

01:06:16.052 --> 01:06:19.055
I'll check on that
contract tomorrow.
You shouldn't be alone.

01:06:19.555 --> 01:06:22.058
No, I'm doing all right.

01:06:26.562 --> 01:06:29.065
Well, I'll see you
at the studio.

01:06:29.065 --> 01:06:31.067
Yeah, on thursday.

01:06:31.567 --> 01:06:33.569
I'll see you
thursday evening.

01:06:33.569 --> 01:06:36.572
Right. Yeah.

01:06:39.575 --> 01:06:43.079
No, I like poetry.
Yeah.

01:06:43.079 --> 01:06:46.082
I'm doing a lot of things
I've never done before.

01:06:47.583 --> 01:06:50.086
I guess it's exciting,
yeah.

01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:56.592
So I'll see you
thursday night.

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:04.603
Pretty small.
Hmm.

01:09:05.104 --> 01:09:07.106
Big memory though.

01:09:12.111 --> 01:09:16.615
- A man I met once chose me
to reveal a secret to.
- Yeah?

01:09:18.617 --> 01:09:23.122
He'd been working on
a government project.
I guess he...

01:09:23.122 --> 01:09:27.126
doesn't believe in it
anymore and needed
somebody on the outside.

01:09:29.627 --> 01:09:35.134
Why did he pick you?
Weren't you a big-shot
movie producer or something?

01:09:35.134 --> 01:09:37.636
I thought everybody
hated you guys.

01:09:39.138 --> 01:09:43.642
They do, but for some reason,
I guess... he liked me.

01:09:48.147 --> 01:09:50.149
Don't like us too much.

01:09:54.653 --> 01:09:56.655
I try not to.

01:09:59.158 --> 01:10:01.660
Good.

01:10:02.161 --> 01:10:06.165
Just let us like you.
That's less dangerous.

01:10:06.165 --> 01:10:08.667
Hmm.
I hope so.

01:10:18.794 --> 01:10:22.798
You're doing great, Ray.
They're getting it all going.

01:10:25.301 --> 01:10:28.804
That, uh, maid
working out okay?

01:10:28.804 --> 01:10:31.307
Yeah, fine.

01:10:32.308 --> 01:10:34.810
It's hard to get
good help
these days.

01:10:37.313 --> 01:10:39.815
Your part
should be done in
a couple of months.

01:10:39.815 --> 01:10:42.818
Then the operators
will take over.
That will be good.

01:10:45.321 --> 01:10:50.326
Just wanted to touch base,
tell you we're all
very happy with your work.

01:10:50.326 --> 01:10:52.828
Country's grateful
and all that.

01:10:59.335 --> 01:11:01.837
If we can
get this thing
fully operational soon...

01:11:01.837 --> 01:11:04.340
it'll be
an awesome tool.

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:08.344
Cut down on
crime response time
by 200 percent.

01:11:08.344 --> 01:11:11.847
Accuracy,
eyewitness evidence.

01:11:12.848 --> 01:11:16.852
Could mean
the end of violence
as we know it.

01:11:16.852 --> 01:11:19.855
That would be good.

01:11:19.855 --> 01:11:25.361
Of course if there was
just one little, tiny,
infinitesimal leak...

01:11:25.361 --> 01:11:27.863
before congress
approved it,

01:11:27.863 --> 01:11:30.866
we'd have to wipe
the whole thing out.

01:11:32.368 --> 01:11:34.870
Everything
down the drain.

01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:36.872
Poof.

01:11:36.872 --> 01:11:38.874
Oh, they'd crucify
all of us.

01:11:40.876 --> 01:11:43.379
Not a perfect system.

01:11:43.379 --> 01:11:47.383
I've worked on projects
before that weren't popular
with the public.

01:11:51.387 --> 01:11:54.890
You're not in
nasa anymore, toto.

01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:57.893
You're not watching
the heavens from earth.
That's easy.

01:11:59.895 --> 01:12:03.899
You're watching earth
from the heavens.
That's messier.

01:12:05.901 --> 01:12:09.905
A system like this,
there's the chance
for abuse.

01:12:15.911 --> 01:12:20.416
If you, uh, see anything
that I miss...

01:12:21.417 --> 01:12:23.419
any misuse,

01:12:23.419 --> 01:12:27.923
anything, uh, strange...

01:12:27.923 --> 01:12:30.426
you'll let me know,
right?

01:12:30.926 --> 01:12:33.929
I'm a computer scientist.
This is Hollywood.

01:12:33.929 --> 01:12:36.432
What's not strange?

01:12:57.453 --> 01:13:00.456
Don't worry about
seeds of violence, Paige.

01:13:00.456 --> 01:13:03.459
The movie's a drain
on your cash flow anyway.

01:13:03.459 --> 01:13:07.963
It's the record company
that'll be your top asset with
the merger after the divorce.

01:13:07.963 --> 01:13:11.467
Hmm.
How do you divorce
a missing husband?

01:13:11.467 --> 01:13:14.470
Trust me.

01:13:16.472 --> 01:13:18.474
Hold on, Brian.

01:13:18.474 --> 01:13:21.977
- Go ahead, Claire.
- The production reports
are just about...

01:13:39.995 --> 01:13:41.997
okay, dad...
what's the matter?

01:13:43.999 --> 01:13:46.001
Now, is nothing
the matter?

01:13:48.003 --> 01:13:50.005
Dad, i, uh...

01:13:54.009 --> 01:13:58.013
- I have a problem, and, um...
- shoot.

01:14:00.516 --> 01:14:02.518
People are being killed.

01:14:05.521 --> 01:14:08.023
I don't know, dad.

01:14:08.023 --> 01:14:10.526
I don't even know if...

01:14:13.028 --> 01:14:15.030
I don't even know
if this place is safe.

01:14:15.531 --> 01:14:19.034
Can you be...
let out of anything?

01:14:23.539 --> 01:14:26.542
We've got to get
to-together on that.

01:14:26.542 --> 01:14:29.545
Now, I think...

01:14:29.545 --> 01:14:32.047
it's a different
"doll" game.

01:14:34.049 --> 01:14:36.051
Any-anything,
anything?

01:14:38.554 --> 01:14:41.557
You better hold on.

01:14:41.557 --> 01:14:44.059
All right.

01:14:44.059 --> 01:14:46.061
I will, dad.

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:54.203
I ain't never done this shit.

01:14:56.705 --> 01:14:58.207
I'm a rapper, so...

01:15:00.209 --> 01:15:02.211
I don't know.

01:15:03.712 --> 01:15:08.217
- This here is called
"when I close my eyes."
- Okay.

01:15:08.217 --> 01:15:11.720
I'm gonna try
and lay it down for you...

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:16.225
like the black man
and not the gangster man do,

01:15:16.225 --> 01:15:19.728
because you ladies like
to watch your figure.

01:15:19.728 --> 01:15:23.232
I'll take the fat out
and the sugar too.

01:15:27.236 --> 01:15:29.738
See, I'm talking about
a new sound.

01:15:32.241 --> 01:15:35.744
Somebody tell me just
the other day, like a...

01:15:35.744 --> 01:15:39.248
voice from heaven while
I'm riding down the freeway.

01:15:39.248 --> 01:15:42.751
He say that gangster sound
is dead and gone.

01:15:43.752 --> 01:15:46.255
He say that nasty groove
is something to prove,

01:15:46.255 --> 01:15:48.757
that getting in your face
can leave an angry taste,

01:15:48.757 --> 01:15:51.260
get you up in arms
about the disgrace...

01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:53.262
and make you shake it
all over the place.

01:15:53.262 --> 01:15:55.764
He say, that's been here,
and now it's gone.

01:15:55.764 --> 01:15:57.766
It's time for the wise
to move on.

01:15:58.267 --> 01:16:03.272
He talking about
some new kind of sound
with a different view.

01:16:03.272 --> 01:16:06.775
We used a hammer.
A golf club would do.

01:16:07.276 --> 01:16:10.279
He say machine-gun lyrics
just fire blanks.

01:16:10.779 --> 01:16:15.284
You're outta the trenches,
put on those
pink-checkered pants.

01:16:15.284 --> 01:16:19.788
He say don't matter
what you say, it's what
they see that win the day.

01:16:19.788 --> 01:16:22.291
He say change your name
from Six to Four,
you'll win the game,

01:16:22.791 --> 01:16:25.794
gain much more.

01:16:25.794 --> 01:16:29.798
I'm talking about
some new kind of sound...

01:16:29.798 --> 01:16:32.301
that's so phat,

01:16:32.301 --> 01:16:34.803
kinda cool in a suit
like some old hep cat.

01:16:36.305 --> 01:16:41.810
But me? I don't know,
and I need it loud and proud,

01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:44.313
not 'cause I need
to stick out the crowd,

01:16:44.313 --> 01:16:46.315
it's 'cause
the sound of silence,

01:16:46.315 --> 01:16:49.818
see, it makes me cry.

01:16:50.319 --> 01:16:54.323
Burns my ears
and spits blood in my eye.

01:16:54.823 --> 01:16:58.327
'Cause it's not
the echo of the shots
still ringing in my head...

01:16:58.327 --> 01:17:02.831
or the line on page three
saying some other
black man dead.

01:17:02.831 --> 01:17:07.336
For me, when I close my eyes,
I only hear one sound.

01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:14.843
The sound of my brother ashe
when he hit that ground.

01:17:32.861 --> 01:17:36.365
I sure admire the way
you guys have jumped back
in the saddle here.

01:17:36.365 --> 01:17:38.867
Some people'd be in hawaii
under protection.

01:17:38.867 --> 01:17:41.370
Police protection
gives me the shivers.

01:17:41.370 --> 01:17:43.372
I know what you mean.

01:17:43.372 --> 01:17:46.875
In the movies,
it always turns out that
there's a leak on the force,

01:17:46.875 --> 01:17:49.378
or the guard
just went for a piss
when the killer comes.

01:17:49.378 --> 01:17:54.383
I hate that stuff.
You guys are way more original.

01:17:54.383 --> 01:17:58.387
- I got eyes
in the back of my head.
- My god, she is something.

01:17:58.387 --> 01:18:00.889
I don't know how you keep
your mind on your work.

01:18:02.891 --> 01:18:04.893
Listen, detective Doc,

01:18:04.893 --> 01:18:07.396
the investigation
is basically over.

01:18:07.396 --> 01:18:11.900
Mike is not
a suspect anymore.
He's a missing person.

01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:17.406
You're the only one
who's trying to figure out
the big, hidden story.

01:18:17.406 --> 01:18:21.410
If there is a connection
between the movie
and Mike's case,

01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:24.413
I think the link
is in your head.

01:18:24.413 --> 01:18:28.417
Have a nice day,
detective Doc.

01:18:30.919 --> 01:18:33.422
Boom is in the shot.

01:18:33.422 --> 01:18:37.426
Look, Claire,
this is impossible.

01:18:37.426 --> 01:18:40.929
You cannot just
waltz in here with anybody.
I know. I'm sorry.

01:18:40.929 --> 01:18:42.931
It won't happen again.

01:18:44.433 --> 01:18:48.437
The guard just went for a piss
before the killer comes in.

01:18:48.437 --> 01:18:54.443
I mean, why do I
make films in America?
I should've stayed in Europe.

01:18:56.445 --> 01:18:59.448
All right,
there's a one-hour break.
We'll shoot it after dinner.

01:18:59.448 --> 01:19:01.950
Anyway,
let's take a break.

01:19:01.950 --> 01:19:03.952
Okay, I'll see you.

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:14.963
You got the part.
Yep. Did you
find your man?

01:19:15.464 --> 01:19:17.966
Nope.
Hmm. What about
your woman?

01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:23.472
Now, I remember
the first line.

01:19:24.973 --> 01:19:28.977
What happens next?
Well, see, I overheard this guy...

01:19:28.977 --> 01:19:30.979
before he killed
my sister,

01:19:30.979 --> 01:19:33.982
and the last thing
she said was,
"how did you find me?"

01:19:33.982 --> 01:19:37.486
And he says,
"I've got eyes
in the back of my head."

01:19:37.486 --> 01:19:41.490
Now, that guy,
he works here.

01:19:41.490 --> 01:19:44.493
So I decide to come pay him
a little visit.

01:19:47.996 --> 01:19:50.499
Hmm.
Sex, murder, revenge.

01:19:50.499 --> 01:19:55.504
- Old-fashioned american fun.
- Hey, whatever brings
people together.

01:19:56.004 --> 01:19:58.006
You never know.

01:20:43.802 --> 01:20:48.807
# When we make love
you know we're making love #

01:20:49.808 --> 01:20:51.810
# to everyone #

01:20:53.311 --> 01:20:56.314
# we've ever made love to #

01:20:57.816 --> 01:21:03.321
# so when you take him
down inside #

01:21:04.823 --> 01:21:09.828
# just know I'm there
with you #

01:21:10.829 --> 01:21:15.333
# and you may
feel me crying #

01:21:16.835 --> 01:21:19.838
# and, oh, I hope you do #

01:21:19.838 --> 01:21:23.341
# I'm out there somewhere
all alone #

01:21:24.342 --> 01:21:26.845
# with memories of you #

01:21:28.847 --> 01:21:33.218
# and you may
feel me crying #

01:21:42.861 --> 01:21:45.864
uh, this one is...
a little silly.

01:21:45.864 --> 01:21:49.367
It's called
"I'm a fluff ball."

01:21:49.367 --> 01:21:53.371
"I'm a fluff ball,
living my fluffy life
in scarcity.

01:21:53.371 --> 01:21:57.375
The life I choose
is an illusion.
The world is an intrusion."

01:21:58.877 --> 01:22:00.879
- What's your name?
- Ruby.

01:22:01.379 --> 01:22:05.383
I'm Ruby,
and I want to fuck you.

01:22:05.383 --> 01:22:08.887
Well,
that's honest.

01:22:08.887 --> 01:22:11.890
And coincidentally,
I want to
fuck you too.

01:22:11.890 --> 01:22:15.393
No, no, I mean,
I want to fuck you.
I want to fuck you.

01:22:15.393 --> 01:22:18.396
Hey, you get that
special feeling.

01:22:18.530 --> 01:22:24.035
I don't think you understand
exactly who's going to be
doing the fucking here.

01:22:27.038 --> 01:22:30.542
Yeah, right.
No, no, it's in here.

01:22:31.042 --> 01:22:34.546
You're kidding.
Show me yours,
I'll show you mine.

01:22:34.546 --> 01:22:37.549
Listen, baby,
I got a better...
forget it.

01:22:37.549 --> 01:22:40.051
My way or no way.
What is this?

01:22:40.051 --> 01:22:43.555
The ultimate
good news/bad news
situation?

01:22:43.555 --> 01:22:47.559
See ya.
Hold on.
This takes a minute.

01:22:47.559 --> 01:22:49.561
Jesus.

01:22:49.561 --> 01:22:52.063
- You remind me of someone.
- Witty.

01:22:52.063 --> 01:22:56.067
Okay, all right,
whatever you want.

01:22:58.069 --> 01:23:01.072
Good, I'll have
a cream soda.
I'll have a cream soda.

01:23:01.072 --> 01:23:04.075
Doesn't a sweet thing
like you worry about
getting hurt?

01:23:04.075 --> 01:23:06.578
There's a lot
of bad boys
out there.

01:23:06.578 --> 01:23:08.580
Mm-hmm. I know.

01:23:09.581 --> 01:23:12.083
But I've got eyes
in the back of my head.

01:23:15.086 --> 01:23:18.590
And cut!
Excellent, Cat.

01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:22.594
That's a print.
Wire them for the bullets
and lots of blood.

01:23:22.594 --> 01:23:25.096
Nice work!

01:23:25.597 --> 01:23:27.599
Good going!

01:23:32.103 --> 01:23:36.107
Great. Great scene, Zoltan.
It was great.
Mm-hmm.

01:23:36.107 --> 01:23:40.612
Thank you, Brian.
But you're not here to
make compliments, right?

01:23:43.114 --> 01:23:46.618
Listen, uh,
I've done all I can do,
all right?

01:23:46.618 --> 01:23:49.120
They pulled the money.
That's it.

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:51.122
I'm sorry.

01:23:53.124 --> 01:23:57.629
Liar. I know who pulled
the money. You don't waste
much time, do you, Brian?

01:23:58.129 --> 01:24:01.132
That's it, Cat.
They're shutting the movie down.

01:24:04.636 --> 01:24:08.139
That's it? It's just...
it's-it's over?

01:24:09.641 --> 01:24:11.643
I'm sorry.

01:24:20.151 --> 01:24:22.654
I guess that's a wrap.

01:24:30.662 --> 01:24:32.664
I'll just be a minute.

01:24:34.165 --> 01:24:36.167
I'm sorry.
You were good.

01:24:36.668 --> 01:24:38.169
You'll get
another break.

01:24:38.670 --> 01:24:41.172
Define "break."

01:25:12.203 --> 01:25:16.207
I guess sometimes your friends
are really your enemies.

01:25:16.207 --> 01:25:19.210
Sometimes your enemies
are your friends.

01:25:19.210 --> 01:25:22.213
Sometimes they're one
and the same.

01:25:22.213 --> 01:25:25.216
Who can you trust?

01:25:25.216 --> 01:25:28.720
It reminds me
of what a prick I was.

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:32.223
I'm starting to think
that fairy tales are overrated.

01:25:32.223 --> 01:25:36.728
Sometimes a good old-fashioned
catastrophe can really cut
to the heart of the matter.

01:25:36.728 --> 01:25:39.230
Ready or not.

01:25:39.230 --> 01:25:43.234
Yeah, well,
I can feel it
cutting right now.

01:25:43.234 --> 01:25:45.236
I'll just go.

01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:51.242
Try and make
the most of it.

01:25:54.245 --> 01:25:56.748
Whew.

01:25:56.748 --> 01:25:58.750
Shit.

01:26:01.252 --> 01:26:03.254
Huh.

01:26:10.261 --> 01:26:13.264
Hey!

01:26:16.768 --> 01:26:19.270
# My heart #

01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:22.273
# animals on wheels #

01:26:22.273 --> 01:26:27.779
# faster, faster
animals on wheels #

01:26:27.779 --> 01:26:32.283
# faster all the time #

01:26:47.916 --> 01:26:51.920
you sure you didn't
break something?
No, it's okay.

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:53.922
Don't worry, I won't sue.

01:26:55.924 --> 01:26:59.427
Well, I gotta say,
you know how
to tell a story.

01:27:00.929 --> 01:27:04.432
It must all seem
completely bizarre to you.

01:27:04.432 --> 01:27:07.435
Just a little.
And if it's all true,

01:27:07.435 --> 01:27:10.438
you're gonna have
to trust someone.

01:27:10.939 --> 01:27:13.942
You know, I hate it
in movies when the guy
running from the government...

01:27:14.442 --> 01:27:17.445
meets a well-intentioned,
beautiful girl,

01:27:17.946 --> 01:27:20.448
gives her
top-secret information.

01:27:22.450 --> 01:27:24.452
That character,
she always dies.

01:27:24.953 --> 01:27:28.456
Look, just because some
real FBI guy believes
in movies so much...

01:27:28.456 --> 01:27:30.458
doesn't mean
you have to.

01:27:30.959 --> 01:27:33.461
He doesn't know any better.
You should.

01:27:33.962 --> 01:27:36.965
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm not exactly
the stupid actress...

01:27:36.965 --> 01:27:39.968
who stands at
the edge of the cliff
screaming for help.

01:27:39.968 --> 01:27:42.470
No.

01:27:42.470 --> 01:27:45.974
You're the stupid stuntwoman
who jumps off the cliff.

01:27:45.974 --> 01:27:48.977
This is a lot more dangerous
than the cliff.

01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:53.481
Define "dangerous."

01:27:53.982 --> 01:27:56.484
It comes up fast...

01:27:57.986 --> 01:27:59.988
and...

01:28:02.991 --> 01:28:04.993
you see those two guys
over there?

01:28:04.993 --> 01:28:08.496
If I went for a piss,
they would eat you alive.

01:28:08.496 --> 01:28:10.498
Those two guys?

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.501
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!

01:28:14.002 --> 01:28:16.004
# On the town #

01:28:17.005 --> 01:28:20.508
# with a little drop
of poison #

01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:25.513
# nobody knows #

01:28:25.513 --> 01:28:29.517
# they're lining up
to go insane #

01:28:31.519 --> 01:28:34.022
# I'm all alone #

01:28:35.523 --> 01:28:40.028
# I smoke my friends
down to the filter #

01:28:43.031 --> 01:28:48.036
# but I feel much cleaner
after it rains #

01:28:48.536 --> 01:28:50.538
yeah.

01:28:50.538 --> 01:28:55.043
# She left in the fall
that's her picture
on the wall #

01:28:55.043 --> 01:28:58.046
# she always had
that little drop #

01:28:58.046 --> 01:29:00.548
# of poison #

01:29:06.554 --> 01:29:08.556
hey, where you going, honey?
Party just started.

01:29:09.057 --> 01:29:13.061
# She left in the fall
that's her picture
on the wall #

01:29:13.561 --> 01:29:17.065
# she always had
that little drop of poison #

01:29:17.065 --> 01:29:19.067
hey, easy.

01:29:19.067 --> 01:29:23.571
Guys, can we do
a little negotiation here?

01:29:23.571 --> 01:29:26.074
Ow!

01:29:26.074 --> 01:29:28.576
Fight!

01:29:29.077 --> 01:29:31.079
I'm sorry.

01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:35.583
I don't know.

01:29:35.583 --> 01:29:38.086
Nobody ever gave me
a break before.

01:29:41.089 --> 01:29:43.591
I guess I didn't want
to let you down.

01:30:04.612 --> 01:30:09.117
This is the name
and the number.
Don't use it yourself.

01:30:09.117 --> 01:30:13.121
Wait until you find
somebody capable
you can absolutely trust.

01:30:17.125 --> 01:30:19.127
Like I trust you.

01:30:39.647 --> 01:30:44.652
You've been through
a lot lately. Why don't
you lie low for a while?

01:30:46.654 --> 01:30:49.657
You know, Doc,
I've known guys like you
over the years.

01:30:49.657 --> 01:30:51.659
Sharp, tenacious,

01:30:51.659 --> 01:30:53.661
real prize winners,

01:30:53.661 --> 01:30:58.166
generally obsessed
over the dangerous cases
you've been taken off of.

01:30:58.166 --> 01:31:01.669
Truth is,
there's usually some kind
of personal motive.

01:31:01.669 --> 01:31:06.174
Some hook in the gut.
Is that what's going on
with you, Doc?

01:31:08.176 --> 01:31:10.678
What's going on with me
is that you're trying
to infect me...

01:31:10.678 --> 01:31:15.683
with your
good old-fashioned cynicism,
so I doubt myself and decide...

01:31:15.683 --> 01:31:18.686
that we're really not trying
to cover up some...

01:31:18.686 --> 01:31:21.189
covert, totally illegal,
murderous operation.

01:31:21.189 --> 01:31:23.691
Listen, you just
watch your step.

01:31:24.192 --> 01:31:28.196
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
I think we found Cat.

01:31:28.196 --> 01:31:32.200
We ran a trace on a letter
to her brother in seattle
on his birthday.

01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:35.703
It's from south central.
We're verifying
the address right now.

01:31:35.703 --> 01:31:37.705
Thank you.

01:31:59.861 --> 01:32:03.364
Hi there.
Can you tell me
where number 14 is?

01:32:03.364 --> 01:32:05.366
Up there.
Thank you.

01:32:16.377 --> 01:32:18.880
A cop!
A cop!
Let's go in the car.

01:32:20.882 --> 01:32:23.885
I'm Doc.
I'm here to see Cat.

01:32:23.885 --> 01:32:26.888
You must be Ade.
Hmm.

01:32:26.888 --> 01:32:29.390
So, you here as a cop
or as a human being?

01:32:29.390 --> 01:32:32.393
Umm...
human cop possible?

01:32:32.393 --> 01:32:34.395
Hmm.

01:32:34.395 --> 01:32:36.397
Flying camel possible?

01:32:38.900 --> 01:32:42.403
Seen 'em.
Rare but beautiful.

01:32:44.405 --> 01:32:48.409
Okay, I am here
as a human being.

01:32:49.911 --> 01:32:51.913
Welcome.

01:32:56.417 --> 01:32:58.419
Cat's told me
all about you.

01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:01.923
The Doc's here
on a social call,
blanche.

01:33:02.924 --> 01:33:05.927
It's okay.

01:33:10.932 --> 01:33:15.436
I realized after,
uh... after they tried
to close the case...

01:33:15.436 --> 01:33:21.442
and stop me from digging,
even on my own time,
that, uh...

01:33:22.443 --> 01:33:24.946
this instinct
I had about you...

01:33:24.946 --> 01:33:28.449
that you had some
valuable information,

01:33:28.449 --> 01:33:33.454
some key to the whole puzzle
and that I had to see you...
was...

01:33:33.454 --> 01:33:37.458
based on nothing
except that...

01:33:37.959 --> 01:33:39.961
I wanted to see you.

01:33:40.962 --> 01:33:43.965
I wanted to see you
more than anything.

01:33:45.967 --> 01:33:48.970
- Really?
- Truly.

01:33:48.970 --> 01:33:51.973
Took you a while
to find me.

01:33:52.473 --> 01:33:54.475
You were
pretty well-hidden.

01:33:56.978 --> 01:33:58.980
It's nice to see you.

01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:01.983
It's nice to see you.

01:34:06.487 --> 01:34:11.492
I thought that, um,
maybe you came by because you'd heard...

01:34:11.492 --> 01:34:13.995
you'd heard
that I'd met with Mike.

01:34:13.995 --> 01:34:17.498
What? You saw Mike?

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.004
Since he disappeared?
Briefly.
We had a few beers.

01:34:23.004 --> 01:34:27.008
You had a few beers
with Mike?
Are you kidding?

01:34:27.508 --> 01:34:30.511
What happened?
What did he say?
Hey, flashback.

01:34:30.511 --> 01:34:32.513
Remember, we have
an agreement.

01:34:32.513 --> 01:34:36.517
You are on a special visa,
or you can fly your camel ass
outta here. Okay?

01:34:36.517 --> 01:34:39.020
He's a missing person,
and this is
a double murder case.

01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:42.023
That's just the tip
of the iceberg.
All right.

01:35:04.545 --> 01:35:07.548
By the way,

01:35:07.548 --> 01:35:09.550
I love you.

01:35:41.198 --> 01:35:43.200
They missed him.

01:36:12.863 --> 01:36:16.367
I'm, uh, just going
for something to eat,
guys.

01:37:33.594 --> 01:37:35.596
Come out.

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:42.103
I could've killed you.

01:37:44.105 --> 01:37:46.107
I've been considering that.

01:37:46.107 --> 01:37:50.111
Yeah, me too.
I've been considering a lot.

01:37:55.116 --> 01:37:57.618
I've been watching you.

01:37:57.618 --> 01:38:00.621
I think you've been doing
more than considering.

01:38:06.627 --> 01:38:09.130
You were here,
weren't you?

01:38:11.132 --> 01:38:13.134
You were here before.

01:38:16.137 --> 01:38:18.139
You took your organizer.

01:38:19.140 --> 01:38:23.144
I could feel you,
just like I felt you now.

01:38:24.645 --> 01:38:27.648
You came right in,
but you didn't say anything.

01:38:27.648 --> 01:38:30.151
You let me wonder.

01:38:31.152 --> 01:38:34.155
You haven't communicated once
in two months...

01:38:34.655 --> 01:38:37.658
not a call, not a message.

01:38:38.659 --> 01:38:40.661
I could feel you
punishing me.

01:38:42.163 --> 01:38:44.165
It hurt.

01:38:45.666 --> 01:38:47.668
I couldn't communicate
with you.

01:38:47.668 --> 01:38:52.173
It was too dangerous
for both of us.
For both of us?

01:38:52.173 --> 01:38:57.178
A guy slipped me a
government file, an FBI file.
Now they're trying to kill me.

01:38:57.178 --> 01:39:00.181
Did you kill
those two guys?
No, I didn't.

01:39:00.181 --> 01:39:02.183
I could kill you
right now.

01:39:16.697 --> 01:39:19.700
Somebody tell me
just the other day,
like a voice...

01:39:24.705 --> 01:39:26.707
# somebody tell me
just the other day #

01:39:26.707 --> 01:39:29.710
# like a voice from heaven
while I'm riding
on the freeway #

01:39:32.713 --> 01:39:34.215
look.

01:39:34.715 --> 01:39:38.719
All I can think of while
they had the gun to my head
was how much I loved you.

01:39:40.221 --> 01:39:42.223
I think it saved me.

01:39:43.224 --> 01:39:46.227
I pictured you...

01:39:46.227 --> 01:39:48.729
starting over again...

01:39:48.729 --> 01:39:51.732
but starting over
in a better way.

01:39:53.234 --> 01:39:55.736
I guess guatemala
is out of the question.

01:39:55.736 --> 01:39:58.739
I'm not kidding around.
Everybody thinks
you're dead...

01:39:58.739 --> 01:40:01.242
or a murderer,
a fugitive.

01:40:01.242 --> 01:40:05.246
I can't turn myself in.
Don't you see?

01:40:05.246 --> 01:40:08.249
Who can I
turn myself in to?
Good question.

01:40:08.249 --> 01:40:12.753
I see who you've
turned yourself into.
Kinda like looking in a mirror.

01:40:13.254 --> 01:40:15.256
No.
It's me, Paige.

01:40:16.757 --> 01:40:19.760
It doesn't matter.
You're an intruder
in the middle of the night.

01:40:20.261 --> 01:40:22.263
I'd have every right
to kill you,
every right.

01:40:23.764 --> 01:40:27.768
It's nice to see you
so motivated.
People change.

01:40:30.771 --> 01:40:34.775
Maybe.
It feels good to be
appreciated sometimes,

01:40:34.775 --> 01:40:37.278
to have someone
support you emotionally,

01:40:37.278 --> 01:40:40.781
to have someone
who gives a shit about
who you really are inside.

01:40:40.781 --> 01:40:42.783
Say, baby.

01:40:42.783 --> 01:40:45.786
Baby, you down there?

01:40:46.787 --> 01:40:49.790
I'm coming.
You want some water?

01:40:49.790 --> 01:40:52.293
I want you, baby.

01:40:52.293 --> 01:40:54.795
You got it.

01:41:08.309 --> 01:41:11.812
I keep the company
and the house.

01:41:11.812 --> 01:41:15.816
When everything's settled,
I'll send you
half the cash.

01:41:17.318 --> 01:41:20.821
You would've never let me
have half. You would've
wiggled out of it.

01:41:20.821 --> 01:41:22.823
You bastards always do.

01:41:24.825 --> 01:41:29.330
If there's anything
specific you want,
you let me know now.

01:41:44.345 --> 01:41:46.347
The robe.

01:41:46.347 --> 01:41:50.851
- What?
- I want your robe.

01:41:52.853 --> 01:41:56.357
If you think I'm gonna...

01:41:56.357 --> 01:42:00.361
it's just a robe.
Hmm? That's all I want.

01:42:02.863 --> 01:42:06.367
- Then you'll leave?
- Mm-hmm.

01:42:07.868 --> 01:42:11.872
- That's the deal.
- Half the cash later.

01:42:13.874 --> 01:42:16.377
The robe now.

01:42:16.877 --> 01:42:20.881
Say, baby,
you all right?
Yeah!

01:42:20.881 --> 01:42:25.886
I'm coming!
Oh, could you
put some music on?

01:42:35.896 --> 01:42:39.900
Half my kingdom for a robe.
It's a pretty good deal...

01:42:41.402 --> 01:42:43.404
even in Hollywood.

01:43:02.423 --> 01:43:04.925
Mmm.

01:43:06.927 --> 01:43:11.432
First time I've seen it
with a woman with a gun
who takes her clothes off.

01:43:12.433 --> 01:43:14.435
I like it.

01:43:14.435 --> 01:43:16.437
Now everybody has
what they want.

01:43:28.949 --> 01:43:31.452
Is it won'th dying for?

01:43:31.452 --> 01:43:33.454
It always was.

01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:41.962
Ramon gomez.

01:43:43.464 --> 01:43:46.967
Whatever you were
gonna give to me,
give to him.

01:43:48.969 --> 01:43:50.971
If you're gonna
run a company...

01:43:51.972 --> 01:43:53.974
trust your instincts.

01:43:53.974 --> 01:43:56.477
You got what it takes.

01:44:04.485 --> 01:44:07.488
Be careful with those things.
They can be dangerous...

01:44:07.988 --> 01:44:10.491
if you can get 'em to work.

01:44:16.997 --> 01:44:19.500
Paige! What happened?

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:22.002
Paige! Answer me!

01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:38.986
I don't know how
you work on that junk,
that antiquated typewriter.

01:44:38.986 --> 01:44:43.490
You gotta change to a computer.
I can hook it up for you.
No, no!

01:44:43.490 --> 01:44:46.994
I think the idea
of this is right.

01:44:47.494 --> 01:44:49.496
Yeah?
Not your computer.

01:44:49.496 --> 01:44:51.999
Not the computer?
Oh, no, no, no.

01:44:51.999 --> 01:44:54.001
Umm...

01:44:54.001 --> 01:44:58.005
well, an old man...
is an old man.

01:44:58.005 --> 01:45:03.010
I have nothing to...
to lose except that...

01:45:03.510 --> 01:45:06.513
as long as you
remain with me.

01:45:19.143 --> 01:45:22.646
Stop sliding around
with your gun like some
paranoid drug lord.

01:45:22.646 --> 01:45:26.650
If somebody wanted to get you,
they'd probably just blow up
your little house.

01:45:28.152 --> 01:45:31.155
Cat?

01:45:31.155 --> 01:45:35.159
I'm the one asking
the questions here.

01:45:45.169 --> 01:45:47.671
What are you
doing here?

01:45:48.172 --> 01:45:50.174
Depends.

01:45:54.178 --> 01:45:56.180
On what?

01:45:57.681 --> 01:45:59.683
Define that thing
you said.

01:46:09.193 --> 01:46:12.196
Define it.

01:46:12.696 --> 01:46:16.200
I can't believe you're here.
Don't change the subject.

01:46:26.710 --> 01:46:28.712
Define it.

01:46:31.715 --> 01:46:33.717
Mmm!

01:46:39.223 --> 01:46:41.225
Be more specific.

01:46:42.726 --> 01:46:46.230
# I was wounded #

01:47:17.144 --> 01:47:20.647
kcrw, a community service
of santa monica college...

01:47:20.647 --> 01:47:22.649
and national public radio.

01:48:58.245 --> 01:49:02.749
# She tucks me in
and then she screams #

01:49:04.251 --> 01:49:09.373
# one day you will
have to choose #

01:50:01.425 --> 01:50:05.429
what a city.
Nothing like it.

01:50:05.429 --> 01:50:07.931
If we could see it.

01:50:13.937 --> 01:50:16.440
Are you Doc?
Yeah.

01:50:18.942 --> 01:50:21.445
So, you, uh...
uuh!

01:50:29.453 --> 01:50:31.455
Oh!

01:50:32.956 --> 01:50:34.958
Come here!

01:50:34.958 --> 01:50:37.961
Don't move, don't move.
My god, they could
shoot anybody.

01:51:00.984 --> 01:51:04.988
Come on, kids, come on.

01:51:26.009 --> 01:51:28.011
Mommy.

01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:39.022
I'll spare you
the speech.

01:51:39.022 --> 01:51:42.025
3,500 murders
last year.

01:51:44.027 --> 01:51:47.531
Anything that helps you
see the truth is good.

01:51:47.531 --> 01:51:49.533
Ray is the traitor.

01:52:21.314 --> 01:52:26.953
Ray dug his own grave.
You don't change your mind
on the battlefield.

01:52:26.953 --> 01:52:28.955
At least I knew
you wouldn't.

01:52:28.955 --> 01:52:32.959
They said, get us someone
who'll risk her life.

01:52:32.959 --> 01:52:36.963
I said,
I'll get you somebody
who owes us her life,

01:52:36.963 --> 01:52:39.966
who owes us
for her salvation,

01:52:39.966 --> 01:52:43.970
a woman whose husband was killed
in front of her eyes.

01:52:44.471 --> 01:52:46.973
I don't know why I'm trying
to cheer you up.

01:52:46.973 --> 01:52:50.477
I'm the one who had to shut down
this whole operation.

01:52:52.479 --> 01:52:54.481
We were trying to do
something good.

01:52:54.481 --> 01:52:57.484
Ray was trying
to do something good.

01:52:57.484 --> 01:52:59.486
Ray was doing
something stupid.

01:53:00.987 --> 01:53:03.490
You're good, mathilda.

01:53:05.492 --> 01:53:07.994
People with good intentions
aren't enough.

01:53:11.998 --> 01:53:14.000
Changing things takes guts.

01:53:15.502 --> 01:53:19.506
Changing yourself...
that takes guts.

01:53:28.515 --> 01:53:32.018
Listen to us.
A couple of killers...

01:53:32.018 --> 01:53:35.021
trying to change the world.

01:53:40.527 --> 01:53:42.529
I'm finished.

01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:46.032
I've paid you back.

01:53:47.033 --> 01:53:49.536
We are even now.

01:53:49.536 --> 01:53:52.539
I'm gonna
take my daughter...

01:53:52.539 --> 01:53:54.541
and start my life over.

01:53:56.042 --> 01:53:59.546
And if you think
that you still own me...

01:54:02.048 --> 01:54:04.551
then you can shoot me
in the back.

01:54:17.063 --> 01:54:19.065
Mathilda!

01:54:35.081 --> 01:54:37.584
Habla espanol?

01:54:38.585 --> 01:54:40.587
Poco.

01:54:40.587 --> 01:54:44.591
- How poco?
- Very poco.

01:54:48.845 --> 01:54:50.847
Why don't you
teach me some?

01:54:52.849 --> 01:54:54.851
Uhh...

01:54:54.851 --> 01:54:57.854
madre.
Mm-hmm.

01:54:59.856 --> 01:55:03.359
- Los angeles.
- Los angeles.

01:55:03.359 --> 01:55:05.862
Los angeles.

01:55:09.365 --> 01:55:12.869
- Sky.
- Cielo.

01:55:12.869 --> 01:55:14.871
I thoughtcielo
meant heaven.

01:55:15.371 --> 01:55:17.373
Cielomeans
both heaven and sky.

01:55:28.384 --> 01:55:30.386
They're watching us.

01:55:32.889 --> 01:55:34.390
Mommy!

01:55:34.891 --> 01:55:37.393
Don't get too close
to the edge.

01:55:59.916 --> 01:56:04.921
Funny. Just when you think
you've got it all figured,

01:56:04.921 --> 01:56:07.423
in a heartbeat
it changes again.

01:56:10.426 --> 01:56:12.428
Thing is,

01:56:12.428 --> 01:56:17.433
all those years
while I was waiting
for that sudden attack,

01:56:17.433 --> 01:56:20.436
I became the enemy.

01:56:20.436 --> 01:56:24.440
And when the enemy I'd expected
finally came,

01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:26.943
they set me free.

01:56:30.446 --> 01:56:32.949
It's strange, hmm?

01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:50.083
Now, when I look over
the ocean...

01:56:51.584 --> 01:56:56.589
I don't expect
nuclear submarines
or alien attackers anymore.

01:56:57.590 --> 01:57:00.093
I can see china now,

01:57:01.094 --> 01:57:03.596
and I hope they can see us.

01:57:42.518 --> 01:57:45.521
# It's a beautiful day today #

01:57:45.521 --> 01:57:48.524
# everything is going my way #

01:57:48.524 --> 01:57:51.027
# even the words
doing what I say #

01:57:51.027 --> 01:57:54.030
# oh, babe

01:57:54.030 --> 01:57:56.532
# to be impossible #

01:57:56.532 --> 01:57:59.535
# isn't that difficult #

01:57:59.535 --> 01:58:02.038
# in the city you're invisible #

01:58:02.038 --> 01:58:05.541
# when you come from

01:58:05.541 --> 01:58:08.161
# everything is all right #

01:58:08.161 --> 01:58:10.163
# everything is all right #

01:58:10.163 --> 01:58:12.665
# I'm not your baby #

01:58:13.166 --> 01:58:16.169
# please #

01:58:16.169 --> 01:58:18.671
# tourist in a traffic jam #

01:58:18.671 --> 01:58:21.674
# baby sham and handy cam #

01:58:21.674 --> 01:58:24.177
# I'm not your mother
you're not my man #

01:58:24.677 --> 01:58:26.679
# I'm not your baby #

01:58:26.679 --> 01:58:29.682
# don't treat me
like I'm a trick #

01:58:29.682 --> 01:58:32.185
# I won't treat you
like you're a prick #

01:58:32.185 --> 01:58:35.188
# don't need no doctor
I'm not ill #

01:58:35.188 --> 01:58:38.691
# I'm not your baby #

01:58:38.691 --> 01:58:41.194
# everything is all right #

01:58:41.194 --> 01:58:43.696
# everything is all right #

01:58:43.696 --> 01:58:46.199
# I'm not your baby #

01:58:46.199 --> 01:58:50.703
# please #

01:59:11.724 --> 01:59:13.726
# cut out the poetry #

# no time for a "tourniquey" #

# the colors all run out on me #

01:59:27.740 --> 01:59:30.743
# it's heavy as a shopping bag #

01:59:30.743 --> 01:59:34.247

# everything is all right #

01:59:36.249 --> 01:59:39.252
# everything is all right #

01:59:51.764 --> 01:59:54.767
# I'm not your baby #

02:00:02.775 --> 02:00:06.279
# I'm not your baby #

02:00:17.790 --> 02:00:20.793

02:00:20.793 --> 02:00:23.296
# smother me or mother me #

02:00:23.296 --> 02:00:26.299
# I like to feel
this incomplete #

02:00:26.299 --> 02:00:29.802
# I'm not your baby #

02:00:29.802 --> 02:00:32.305

02:00:56.829 --> 02:00:59.832

# daylight's a kind of robbery #

02:01:02.335 --> 02:01:04.837

02:01:30.363 --> 02:01:33.366
# for something
