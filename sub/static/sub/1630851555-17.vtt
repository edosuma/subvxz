00:06.006 --> 00:07.257
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:07.340 --> 00:08.425
Bau!

00:25.859 --> 00:26.860
Did you curse me?

00:28.069 --> 00:29.779
I can't sleep, I feel sick.

00:30.321 --> 00:31.948
I lost a fortune cockfighting.

00:32.449 --> 00:33.283
I told you.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.619
It's your brother. He's watching.
He knows what you do.

00:38.830 --> 00:40.415
He knows you're going to hell.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.668
I'm just a guard here. I need the money.

00:44.919 --> 00:46.087
A job is a job.

00:46.171 --> 00:51.176
He says if it was his daughters,
your nieces, you'd think differently.

00:51.801 --> 00:54.512
Óscar told you that?

00:58.141 --> 00:59.976
The dead try to warn us.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.520
He won't stop tormenting you.

01:03.396 --> 01:04.814
It will get worse.

01:07.942 --> 01:08.943
Ángel.

01:10.028 --> 01:13.031
I've had clients
ask for my help when it's too late.

01:13.114 --> 01:14.324
I'm going crazy.

01:16.451 --> 01:17.952
Tell me how to get rid of him.

01:18.661 --> 01:19.496
Not for free.

01:28.671 --> 01:29.506
Wait!

01:40.600 --> 01:42.227
Manny sent you these invoices.

01:50.026 --> 01:53.446
She's very busy
and she'll be in her office a while.

02:00.078 --> 02:01.579
Don't be afraid.

02:45.206 --> 02:47.125
I didn't think you'd be here.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.045
I was going to leave this outside.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.469
This is everything
Jordi got off the phone.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.182
Let me know if you need anything else.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.018
Why don't we look at it together?

03:05.560 --> 03:08.396
We'd clear things up
and wouldn't have to meet again.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.880
FROM: ANONYMOUS
INCEST IS A CRIME

03:34.547 --> 03:35.673
What is this?

03:36.216 --> 03:37.467
WATCH

03:37.550 --> 03:38.593
Don't open it!

03:44.307 --> 03:45.141
No way.

04:02.367 --> 04:06.704
Is what you said about his brother true
or were you just scaring him?

04:09.540 --> 04:13.378
When people die,
they stay close to those they loved.

04:14.504 --> 04:17.465
But Ángel is consumed by guilt.

04:18.758 --> 04:22.262
I knew that
when you told me he helped you.

04:23.930 --> 04:27.892
The rest is his own superstition.

04:28.476 --> 04:29.852
You're a genius.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.365
If he rats us out, we're dead.

04:42.949 --> 04:46.035
I'd rather run that risk
than keep rotting in here.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.971
I'm not available. Leave a message.

05:05.680 --> 05:09.600
Héctor, it's Matilde again.
You didn't make the meeting.

05:10.977 --> 05:14.439
Did I mix up the day?
Call me when you can, okay?

05:19.444 --> 05:21.529
The email that sent the video
is untraceable.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.197
So is my sister's message.

05:23.781 --> 05:25.491
Did they use the same technology?

05:25.575 --> 05:27.160
It might not be a coincidence.

05:27.243 --> 05:29.829
Did you upload anything
about the case or my sister?

05:30.371 --> 05:33.499
A post from a chatroom
or an email you sent a friend?

05:33.583 --> 05:35.126
Or a message you sent Lorenzo?

05:35.752 --> 05:36.961
-Anything?
-No.

05:37.628 --> 05:38.463
Are you sure?

05:39.464 --> 05:41.132
Do you think they're watching me?

05:42.675 --> 05:45.136
We're getting too close to them.

05:46.763 --> 05:50.767
What does the video have to do with that?
They aren't asking for anything.

05:51.642 --> 05:52.894
Do they want to scare me?

05:54.687 --> 05:55.605
Or destroy you.

05:56.981 --> 05:59.776
These things blow over quickly.
People forget--

05:59.859 --> 06:03.571
What's going on downstairs?
Did you see all the reporters?

06:03.654 --> 06:06.866
I knew that wanting to be famous
could change people.

06:08.868 --> 06:13.247
But I never thought my own daughter
could stoop so low.

06:13.331 --> 06:17.126
How could you do this?
Is fame really that important to you?

06:17.210 --> 06:18.753
What are you talking about?

06:25.843 --> 06:30.056
AS TOLD BY MATILDE, HER MOTHER UNDERWENT
HORMONE THERAPY TO BECOME A MAN

06:32.850 --> 06:35.561
Lots of people keep coming,
some with cameras.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.606
-I need to get out of here.
-Let's go.

06:38.689 --> 06:42.735
-Dad, I swear I didn't say anything.
-Yeah, sure.

06:42.819 --> 06:46.656
You got 12,000 followers in the two hours
since the article was published.

06:56.958 --> 06:57.875
Damn it!

07:04.257 --> 07:08.344
I said I'd call you
when your cards were done.

07:08.428 --> 07:13.015
They weren't ready yesterday
or three days ago or today.

07:14.225 --> 07:17.979
-But I need them urgently.
-You'll just have to wait.

07:18.688 --> 07:19.522
That's it.

07:45.631 --> 07:46.883
Open up! Police!

07:51.179 --> 07:53.431
It's me. Let's go.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.350
I'll explain later. Come on.

07:58.686 --> 08:03.316
A lot of purchases I didn't make,
2,500 yards of rugs, 11,000 light bulbs…

08:03.399 --> 08:04.609
What are you saying?

08:05.443 --> 08:07.528
Rogelio's using the club to launder money.

08:07.612 --> 08:10.907
-What money?
-I don't know. I don't get it.

08:11.407 --> 08:14.827
I just know I have to leave Mexico
and let him deal with it.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.954
No, Manny. Running away won't help.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.791
And going to jail will?
I'm never going back to prison.

08:25.004 --> 08:29.342
I swear I didn't speak with Beto Puertas
or any reporter.

08:29.425 --> 08:31.135
Then it had to be your agent.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.721
Héctor… What's his last name?

08:33.804 --> 08:37.725
Fuentes, but he's not involved.
I said nothing to him about Daniel.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.775
You're a couple? Since when?

08:46.359 --> 08:47.735
It's been a few weeks

08:47.818 --> 08:51.072
but we hadn't found
the right time to tell you.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.492
It's terrible news, isn't it?

08:54.575 --> 08:58.704
No, I'm glad at least someone
in the family is happy.

08:59.497 --> 09:00.873
For once in our lives.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.918
I wish I had such good news.

09:04.418 --> 09:05.378
What happened?

09:05.878 --> 09:11.551
Someone placed a camera
in a hotel room I stayed in three days ago

09:11.634 --> 09:12.843
and they taped me.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.638
They sent me the video yesterday.

09:15.721 --> 09:18.558
Fede, are you saying
you were taped having sex?

09:18.641 --> 09:22.937
Yes, Mom, having sex,
but not with just anyone.

09:25.147 --> 09:28.067
With Valentina de la Paz.

09:28.776 --> 09:32.989
Mom, we met and fell in love
before we knew we were siblings.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.658
We've tried avoiding each other, but--

09:35.741 --> 09:39.078
Is the hotel blackmailing you?

09:39.161 --> 09:41.747
No, they say they know nothing about it.

09:41.831 --> 09:45.209
But they can't give me hotel security
tapes without a court order.

09:45.710 --> 09:49.505
And it's not blackmail.
They demanded nothing in the email.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.424
You need to go to the police.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.718
I can't go to the police.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.430
"Incest is a crime."

09:58.723 --> 10:01.434
-That's the video's title.
-What? No!

10:02.184 --> 10:04.395
Mom, wait, please.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.735
Everything will be fine. You'll see.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.696
You really don't want me to sleep over?

10:14.655 --> 10:15.573
Don't worry.

10:20.828 --> 10:21.704
What's wrong?

10:26.667 --> 10:27.960
I'm famous!

10:37.720 --> 10:39.972
You threatened to report me.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.183
I told you it wasn't me.

10:42.933 --> 10:44.727
I was following you to protect you.

10:48.105 --> 10:49.482
What will they do to Julia?

10:49.899 --> 10:51.067
They'll arrest her.

10:51.942 --> 10:55.613
When they collect the evidence,
they'll force her to confess who paid her.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.948
Then they'll arrest the others.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.034
The women at the home?

11:02.620 --> 11:04.038
The nuns at the convent?

11:16.384 --> 11:19.261
You know you can count on me
for anything, Fede.

11:19.804 --> 11:20.721
Thanks, Uncle.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.015
Here.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.184
I didn't have time to look at it.

11:25.267 --> 11:28.688
It's my dad's cellphone data
if you're still interested.

11:28.771 --> 11:29.647
Yes.

11:30.481 --> 11:31.315
Okay.

11:33.609 --> 11:34.694
Call me.

11:41.450 --> 11:44.286
Could Federico be imprisoned for this?

11:44.370 --> 11:46.539
No, we'll deal with it.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.375
Valentina and Federico don't deserve this.

11:49.458 --> 11:52.002
-No.
-Hey. It's okay.

11:52.920 --> 11:56.048
Calm down.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.216
Don't go anywhere.

12:00.010 --> 12:02.805
I'll try to find out
what's going on with Julia.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.976
I need to notify the convent and Grandpa.

12:07.059 --> 12:09.520
No, don't tell anyone.
Listen to me this time.

12:09.603 --> 12:12.523
I don't agree with it,
but I'd never report you.

12:14.316 --> 12:15.484
I love you.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.073
Boss.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.618
Caridad had to go down too, Víctor.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.579
She's back home. What happened?

13:08.662 --> 13:11.791
We don't know but she's doomed
when the old lady talks.

13:11.874 --> 13:14.293
Everything is going according to plan.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.378
I'll get them, I swear.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.421
You'd better.

13:29.308 --> 13:30.309
What's up?

13:30.392 --> 13:32.770
I'm guarding the VIP at the heliport.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.739
I'll be fired if I'm late.

13:44.406 --> 13:45.366
Open up. Go on.

13:56.210 --> 13:57.044
Thanks.

14:12.017 --> 14:14.854
THE GREAT MYSTERY OF DOMINGA HEREDIA.
BY ALBERTO PUERTAS

14:17.189 --> 14:19.066
ALBERTO PUERTAS

14:22.778 --> 14:24.613
I'M THE DAUGHTER OF A SECRET

14:31.161 --> 14:34.540
Being transgender
is neither a flaw nor a disease.

14:34.623 --> 14:36.834
It's his nature and he's happy now.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.210
I'm telling you this

14:38.294 --> 14:41.005
so you'll stop worrying
about your grandchild.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.798
I hope I'm not wrong.

14:46.093 --> 14:49.138
So we've got enough proof
of money laundering.

14:50.180 --> 14:54.894
And grounds for extradition to Spain.
The guy was right to report her, Lozano.

14:54.977 --> 14:59.273
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.
That bitch won't get away this time.

14:59.815 --> 15:01.233
When can I get her up?

15:02.109 --> 15:05.905
In a few days when we get the papers
with her name and signature.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.406
Perfect.

15:13.495 --> 15:15.497
CAMILO

15:21.253 --> 15:23.881
ALBERTO PUERTAS

15:25.049 --> 15:26.967
It's my agent, Héctor Fuentes.

15:27.718 --> 15:29.720
Matilde, he's not an agent.

15:30.387 --> 15:33.140
And his name isn't Héctor Fuentes,
it's Beto Puertas.

15:33.223 --> 15:36.560
He's a showbiz reporter
who's obsessed with your mom.

15:36.644 --> 15:40.022
His career was over
until he published this.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.441
It was a trick to make you talk.

16:04.713 --> 16:08.592
I wanted to be famous,
and now I just want to die.

16:09.677 --> 16:10.678
Don't say that.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.600
The world is better with you in it.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.296
Where you going?

18:09.379 --> 18:11.757
To get a glass of water. Want one?

18:13.342 --> 18:15.260
-Don't take too long.
-Okay.

18:56.468 --> 19:00.180
Why don't we make a bonfire?
It's the perfect evening for it.

19:00.264 --> 19:01.140
What?

19:01.223 --> 19:02.516
It'll do you good.

19:03.475 --> 19:05.394
Come on, get dressed.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.605
-Come on.
-Okay.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.150
Give me a kiss.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.235
Trust me.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.797
My dad murdered Simón.

19:34.756 --> 19:35.591
What?

19:43.640 --> 19:45.184
My name is Simón Marroquín.

19:46.518 --> 19:49.938
I'm taping this
in case something happens to me.

19:51.023 --> 19:55.611
It's my testimony against my father,
Rogelio Marroquín.

19:56.778 --> 19:59.948
And it may be used against him.

20:04.578 --> 20:08.540
Matilde, the last thing I need
is a bonfire with your boyfriend.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.292
I said I'm not in the mood.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.336
I'm not in the mood either, so…

20:12.419 --> 20:14.463
-Enough.
-What's going on?

20:16.381 --> 20:18.634
-Is it safe to talk here, Jordi?
-Yes.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.345
Rogelio's spying on us.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.773
The next bus to Mexico City
is in two hours.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.112
I kept my part of the deal, so talk.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.991
Make an altar to your brother
with his most recent photo.

20:43.825 --> 20:46.578
Starting tomorrow
pray for the souls in Purgatory,

20:47.412 --> 20:50.374
light a purple candle,
it can't be any other color,

20:50.457 --> 20:52.918
and burn something of his
while asking for forgiveness.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.546
Keep this with you always.

21:01.260 --> 21:04.179
Salt and sugar
to quench his soul's thirst.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.307
He'll stop tormenting you
as long as you use it.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.142
What else do I need to do?

21:11.603 --> 21:13.939
Call the cops and report your bosses.

21:15.607 --> 21:16.858
But that's up to you.

21:19.861 --> 21:20.737
Thanks.

21:31.039 --> 21:32.040
Salt and sugar?

21:32.749 --> 21:34.126
I found nothing better.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.921
I don't have my work utensils.

21:38.005 --> 21:40.716
I need a phone. I want to call my sisters.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.635
No, we don't know
if anyone here works for The Aquarium.

21:44.386 --> 21:45.595
Let's wait for the bus.

21:46.805 --> 21:47.639
Come on.

21:49.725 --> 21:53.687
The problem is that the recording
might be useless.

21:54.187 --> 21:58.108
Why? It's proof
that Simon was a threat to Rogelio.

21:58.191 --> 22:01.653
If he talked about his secret companies
in the Cayman Islands

22:01.737 --> 22:02.988
he would've ruined him.

22:03.071 --> 22:05.032
But it's been more than three months.

22:05.615 --> 22:08.577
He could've changed names, bank accounts.

22:08.660 --> 22:12.581
I know him pretty well.
He's always ten steps ahead of everyone.

22:12.664 --> 22:17.252
He'll say whatever it takes,
that Simón was speaking nonsense.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.547
What about all the shady deals
he mentions in the tape?

22:20.630 --> 22:24.676
I don't know.
My poor mom probably knew all about them.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.804
We can't ignore this, Ignacio.
We must do something.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.849
Yes, but calmly. We need more information.

22:31.725 --> 22:35.103
One mistake and we'll end up
like my Mom and my brother.

22:36.772 --> 22:43.195
Yes, it's awful that he's watching us,
but it's probably to protect us.

22:43.278 --> 22:47.074
Oh please, Caridad!
He's got spy cams all over the house.

22:47.657 --> 22:48.742
In the bedrooms.

22:49.284 --> 22:53.163
He watches his grandkids have sex.
He's a bastard and a pervert.

22:53.246 --> 22:54.247
What for?

22:54.331 --> 22:57.084
To gather information like all spies do.

22:57.751 --> 22:59.127
To know your secrets.

23:02.631 --> 23:05.050
Motherfucker!

23:05.550 --> 23:10.806
This is a top-notch system.
It even transmits color videos.

23:13.141 --> 23:15.394
Someone fixed a cord recently.

23:15.977 --> 23:16.812
That fucker.

23:18.021 --> 23:20.607
No wonder the water heater
is always broken.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.401
Víctor's in on it.

23:23.151 --> 23:24.403
What do we do?

23:24.486 --> 23:28.365
He doesn't know we're onto him,
so we investigate what he's up to.

23:42.003 --> 23:43.713
The signal crashed, Víctor.

23:45.382 --> 23:46.591
How would I know?

23:47.759 --> 23:48.844
Go check it out.

23:49.886 --> 23:50.804
And be careful.

23:51.721 --> 23:55.976
The girls made a bonfire in the yard.
I can't watch them there.

23:57.477 --> 23:58.311
Hurry.

24:27.632 --> 24:28.800
I'm here, boss.

24:29.676 --> 24:32.304
It's the main cord, not rats this time.

24:33.054 --> 24:34.431
I think it's loose.

24:34.514 --> 24:37.309
They're not in the yard.
They must be asleep.

24:37.392 --> 24:39.102
I'll fix this and leave.

24:41.354 --> 24:43.231
Don't move.

24:44.858 --> 24:47.402
Get up. Now!

24:47.986 --> 24:50.614
You're not the first person
to fuck with me so do as I say.

25:22.395 --> 25:25.524
REC
VALENTINA'S ROOM

25:30.070 --> 25:31.321
He could be watching.

25:31.404 --> 25:35.367
No. We're asleep, there's nothing to see.
We need to trust Jordi.

25:35.450 --> 25:36.284
Let's go.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.638
That's for trying to kill me.

25:59.349 --> 26:02.435
And this means,
start talking or I'll kick your butt.

26:09.484 --> 26:12.195
I'll need a couple of hours
to get what I need.

26:12.862 --> 26:15.532
-We can take care of it ourselves.
-I'm sure you can.

26:15.615 --> 26:16.616
Talk.

26:16.700 --> 26:19.744
I told you I know nothing.
I'm just the cable guy.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.038
Víctor. Help us.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.749
I know you're not like Rogelio.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.502
Manny, what are you doing?

26:28.420 --> 26:33.675
Men lose all their cockiness when you
take off their clothes in front of women.

26:34.884 --> 26:37.512
Especially four of us.

26:45.020 --> 26:49.232
Have you been told you're poorly endowed?
I'm pretty experienced, you know.

26:49.316 --> 26:50.150
-Manny.
-Yes.

26:51.318 --> 26:54.529
-Speak and let's get this over with.
-What's the geezer want?

26:58.199 --> 26:59.492
Talk, asshole.

27:00.994 --> 27:05.123
-Speak.
-Manny, that's enough! Stop it!

27:10.754 --> 27:13.131
Talk or I'll let Manny do this all night.

27:16.926 --> 27:17.761
Talk!

27:18.261 --> 27:20.972
The boss wants payback
for what you did to his son.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.558
He played you for fools.

27:24.934 --> 27:27.062
He played all five of you morons.

27:30.315 --> 27:34.361
Getting you in the same house was a matter
of making it your only option.

27:36.613 --> 27:40.492
Manny, an anonymous video
showing your talents on the pole

27:40.575 --> 27:43.119
would convince
any company not to hire you.

27:45.205 --> 27:49.584
And without regular work, a house
and $5,000 was just what you needed.

27:54.881 --> 27:59.427
For Matilde we just had to convince Daniel
that you weren't safe in his house.

28:02.972 --> 28:07.268
When your idiot ex-husband
left a dead rat in the house,

28:07.352 --> 28:09.145
it gave us the perfect idea.

28:09.229 --> 28:12.649
No way! Who did this to you?

28:14.401 --> 28:18.238
Bautista, we had to take away
your savings and clients.

28:18.321 --> 28:20.949
Hacking an Instagram account
was very easy.

28:21.700 --> 28:25.537
And somewhere as dangerous as downtown,
robberies happen every day.

28:28.915 --> 28:31.918
And living with your sister,
we got two birds with one stone.

28:33.837 --> 28:38.550
It just took a good incentive for your
landlord to kick you out, Valentina.

28:43.012 --> 28:45.432
Once all four were convinced,
it was a done deal.

28:46.307 --> 28:50.145
LEASE TERMINATION NOTICE

28:50.228 --> 28:52.605
He didn't need
to do anything about you, Caridad.

28:52.689 --> 28:55.942
You were freeloading at a convent,
so it was easy.

28:56.025 --> 28:57.777
You guys fell like flies.

28:57.861 --> 29:00.739
Do whatever you want to me.
You're all screwed anyway.

29:12.292 --> 29:13.418
Leave your message.

29:13.501 --> 29:17.088
Fede, it's me.
I've been trying to reach Matilde,

29:17.172 --> 29:19.924
but her phone is off
and I need to tell this to someone.

29:20.967 --> 29:22.177
It's about your grandpa.

29:22.677 --> 29:26.973
It might sound crazy,
but I think he set a trap for her.

29:28.975 --> 29:32.145
Even if my Dad knows I was tricked,
I still ruined his life.

29:32.228 --> 29:33.354
His secret is out.

29:33.438 --> 29:35.857
But you're not going to jail
like Caridad and me.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.151
And me if the cops get that video.

29:38.234 --> 29:40.195
I'll be out of work forever.

29:41.321 --> 29:43.239
Who'll hire an incestuous woman?

29:44.574 --> 29:46.659
He's screwing over Federico too.

29:46.743 --> 29:48.328
Rogelio is a psycho like Simón.

29:48.828 --> 29:50.747
I don't care what they do to me.

29:51.331 --> 29:54.501
But the women at the home and the nuns
did nothing to…

29:55.627 --> 29:56.461
To Rogelio.

29:57.587 --> 30:00.590
No, but he knows
that's where it hurts you the most.

30:01.174 --> 30:04.803
He knows how to screw us over
because we gave him the weapons.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.638
My God. Bautista!

30:07.430 --> 30:11.017
Rogelio knows she tried to warn us.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.894
What if he hurt Bautista?

30:15.647 --> 30:18.233
-Manny.
-Where is Bautista?

30:18.733 --> 30:22.028
Speak up,
or I'll blow your balls off, scumbag.

30:29.244 --> 30:32.247
It's locked. I'll use the backdoor.

30:33.164 --> 30:34.082
Wait here.

30:46.427 --> 30:48.429
You have to know. Speak up.

30:49.597 --> 30:50.515
Bautista.

30:52.308 --> 30:53.476
-Sis.
-Bau.

30:55.103 --> 30:56.062
You escaped.

30:56.813 --> 31:01.276
Bautista, you were right.
Rogelio has cameras all over the house.

31:01.359 --> 31:02.527
That's impossible.

31:02.610 --> 31:06.322
He does, and you're the only one
that suspected him.

31:06.406 --> 31:07.323
I mean that.

31:09.409 --> 31:10.702
What do you see?

31:11.828 --> 31:13.746
-He has the birthmark.
-What?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.334
This is a fucking joke.

31:19.252 --> 31:21.838
What about my birthmark?
Please put my clothes on.

31:22.922 --> 31:24.173
It's just like this one.

31:25.633 --> 31:27.093
We inherited it from Rogelio.

31:29.596 --> 31:32.891
You think I owe you something?
You're just a dumb maid.

31:33.391 --> 31:36.269
Don't blame the baby
for what you did to me.

31:36.352 --> 31:39.022
I did nothing to you, got it?

31:39.772 --> 31:43.151
Go away and thank me
for the rest of your miserable life

31:43.234 --> 31:45.737
for not letting the brat starve to death.

31:47.488 --> 31:48.406
Go.

32:12.972 --> 32:17.060
My wife and I agreed to raise you,
but you'll cost us a fortune.

32:18.061 --> 32:20.688
So I hope you'll be grateful and repay me.

32:22.690 --> 32:26.361
And don't think you can run around
the house like you're a Marroquín

32:26.444 --> 32:28.363
because you're not, got it?

32:31.157 --> 32:32.617
Have you done jigsaw puzzles?

32:34.994 --> 32:38.164
It's not for simpletons like you,
but you might learn something.

32:43.336 --> 32:45.254
I always place the last piece.

32:57.266 --> 33:00.186
-I'm whose son?
-You are Rogelio Marroquín's son.

34:34.197 --> 34:36.282
