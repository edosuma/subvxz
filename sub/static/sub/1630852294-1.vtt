Huh, boots.

00:54.012 --> 00:55.889
- Hey!
- Hmm?

00:55.972 --> 00:59.350
You remember yesterday?
Day two of life on this planet?

00:59.434 --> 01:00.685
Mm-hmm.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.937
Back when things
were really cool?

01:03.021 --> 01:04.606
Yeah! Before all
these bears showed up

01:04.689 --> 01:07.108
and started eating
all the ferns!

01:08.485 --> 01:09.944
Aah! Oh, jeez.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.405
Hey!
Who do you think you are?

01:12.489 --> 01:14.949
Protector of this island.

01:15.033 --> 01:18.203
We are the island!

01:20.163 --> 01:23.458
You're the island's hair.
I'm just giving you bangs.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.502
You should feel lucky.

01:27.420 --> 01:30.256
Not everybody can
pull off bangs.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.639
What are we gonna do!

01:37.722 --> 01:40.600
Oh, I don't know.
Live underground?

01:40.683 --> 01:43.061
Grow spikes?

01:43.144 --> 01:45.814
I know I've said this before,
and I've been shot down,

01:45.897 --> 01:47.440
but I am gonna say it again.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.776
Let's give up!

01:49.859 --> 01:52.237
Whoa! What's that?

02:05.416 --> 02:09.045
Just kidding. I'm Barb.
I'm 60. What's up?

02:09.128 --> 02:11.256
Ahh, she's here!

02:11.339 --> 02:13.007
Our savior is here!

02:13.091 --> 02:15.760
A savior?
Is that what I am?

02:15.844 --> 02:18.513
Great!

02:18.596 --> 02:19.973
I like you guys.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.683
So, I'll save you.

02:21.766 --> 02:23.017
Hooray!

02:23.101 --> 02:24.435
- You!
- Sir?

02:24.519 --> 02:26.354
Tell me what the problem is.

02:26.437 --> 02:27.897
Bears are eating us, sir!

02:27.981 --> 02:30.441
And you,
tell me what a bear is.

02:30.525 --> 02:34.571
Well, uh, it's not a gorilla,

02:34.654 --> 02:37.991
and it's not a flamingo.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.534
I'm gonna stop you there.

02:39.617 --> 02:41.828
I don't know what
any of that stuff is.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.705
I was just born. remember?

02:43.788 --> 02:47.709
Okay, a bear it's the biggest
thing on this island.

02:47.792 --> 02:50.837
It's shaggy
and extremely rude.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.380
You'll know it
when you see it.

02:52.463 --> 02:53.548
Got it.

02:53.631 --> 02:56.050
All right, you fernies,
hold tight.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.054
Oof!

03:00.138 --> 03:03.850
Dreadfully sorry!
My fault, excuse me!

03:06.895 --> 03:09.564
Well, aren't you gonna
say sorry, too?

03:09.647 --> 03:12.483
Ask if I'm okay?

03:12.567 --> 03:14.944
Oh, okay, a little rude.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.279
Oh!

03:16.362 --> 03:18.740
Big, shaggy,

03:18.823 --> 03:20.867
extremely rude.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.077
Bear! Ah!

03:23.161 --> 03:26.122
Oh! Bear! Oh! Ooh! Bear!

03:26.205 --> 03:27.624
Bear, bear, bear, bear! Bear!

03:27.707 --> 03:30.960
- What are you doing?
- You like it?

03:31.044 --> 03:33.254
I call it an "undercut."

03:33.338 --> 03:35.590
No, I mean,
what are you doing?

03:35.673 --> 03:37.300
That's not a bear!

03:37.383 --> 03:39.636
What? This thing is brutal!

03:39.719 --> 03:41.179
It's a tree!

03:41.262 --> 03:43.306
- You think I'm brutal?
- Whoa!

03:43.389 --> 03:45.850
Why didn't you say
something before?

03:45.934 --> 03:47.936
- I'm shy.
- Barb!

03:48.019 --> 03:49.896
Enough fraternizing with trees.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.774
Bears!

03:53.608 --> 03:56.569
Okay, guys,
I gotta level with you.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.571
I don't know what I'm doing.

03:58.655 --> 04:01.324
I was born with the confidence
of a thousand bears

04:01.407 --> 04:04.702
but the wherewithal
of a thousand blueberries.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.705
You saw me.
I popped out of a flower.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.124
Nothing but the clothes
on my front

04:10.208 --> 04:12.627
and this weird purse
on my back.

04:12.710 --> 04:15.880
Hey Barb, what is that
on your back?

04:15.964 --> 04:17.382
I don't know.

04:17.465 --> 04:20.093
But it's filled with these
feathers with pointy ends.

04:20.176 --> 04:21.803
That's not a purse.
It's a quiver!

04:21.886 --> 04:25.556
Those are arrows!
You must be a hunter.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.934
A hunter? What's that?

04:28.017 --> 04:30.603
A person
who gets rid of bears.

04:32.981 --> 04:36.275
Oh, dang, that's dark!

04:36.359 --> 04:40.113
You were the one born
with a quiver of arrows.

04:40.196 --> 04:42.532
Okay, my fate is sealed.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.158
Whoo-hoo!

04:44.242 --> 04:45.827
Wahoo!

04:48.246 --> 04:49.747
What's going on?

04:49.831 --> 04:51.332
This is our friend, Kudzu.

04:51.416 --> 04:54.669
They're not from around here
but they cover a lot of ground.

04:54.752 --> 04:56.629
They'll take you to the bears.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.673
Well, why didn't they just do
that the first time

04:58.756 --> 05:01.676
before I spent all that time
fightin' a tree?

05:16.274 --> 05:18.860
Wow, yep, huge.

05:18.943 --> 05:22.989
Not as big as a tree, though,
that was misleading.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.326
Ahhh! Ahhh!

05:30.329 --> 05:33.541
In addition to being big,
shaggy, and rude,

05:33.624 --> 05:37.503
I'd add they are also clumsy,
hungry, and irritable.

05:40.465 --> 05:42.717
I wonder what I'm supposed
to do with this.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.553
Using the pointy end
seems kinda harsh.

05:45.636 --> 05:47.680
Hmm.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.145
How should I use this?

05:54.228 --> 05:56.606
Ooh, that tickles!

05:56.689 --> 05:58.983
Oh, wait! I got an idea.

06:04.489 --> 06:08.034
Hmm?
Stop, stop!

06:08.117 --> 06:10.078
Hey, zip it.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.537
What'd you say?
Don't tickle me then!

06:11.621 --> 06:18.377
What's the matter with you?

06:25.093 --> 06:27.261
Ah.

06:35.394 --> 06:37.522
They're gone.

06:37.605 --> 06:39.482
You got rid of the bears!

06:39.565 --> 06:42.443
Oh, I did, huh?
Maybe I am a hunter.

06:42.527 --> 06:45.780
A hunter for breaking down
systematic injustices

06:45.863 --> 06:47.323
from within!

06:47.406 --> 06:48.950
Sure!

06:50.535 --> 06:52.703
I'll be taking my "leaf" now.

06:52.787 --> 06:56.457
I must return and tell
of my victory. Later!

06:56.541 --> 06:58.084
- Whee!
- Whoo, Barb!

06:58.167 --> 07:01.254
The huntress! Our savior!

07:01.337 --> 07:03.840
Wow, they're rooting for me.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.633
Thank you!

07:08.052 --> 07:11.806
Ah! Aah!

07:11.889 --> 07:13.641
Aah!

07:13.724 --> 07:15.601
Ah, ah!

07:15.685 --> 07:17.103
Hey, no smooching!

07:17.186 --> 07:20.022
Ah!

07:22.191 --> 07:24.068
Oh, no.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.279
- Barb!
- It's her fault.

07:26.362 --> 07:27.780
What's she doing here?

07:27.864 --> 07:31.492
- Boo.
- Boo!

07:31.576 --> 07:35.037
Barb! The bears are even
more irritable than before!

07:35.121 --> 07:37.748
Now the whole island
is in peril!

07:37.832 --> 07:39.333
What have you done?

07:39.417 --> 07:41.085
I can fix this!

07:41.169 --> 07:42.920
No, all you do
is make things worse.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.839
You must leave.

07:44.922 --> 07:47.091
Barb, you are to go to the only
place on this island

07:47.175 --> 07:48.885
where no fern resides.

07:48.968 --> 07:52.013
A place where you won't cause
any more destruction.

07:52.096 --> 07:55.099
- To the mountain!
- Yeah!

07:55.183 --> 07:57.351
- Please, I --
- Exile!

07:57.435 --> 08:01.939
Exile! Exile! Exile!

08:17.997 --> 08:21.834
Oh, Barb,
can't you do anything right?

08:21.918 --> 08:24.962
Hmm, it's kinda cool that
I refer to myself like that.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.590
I'll call it, talking in
the third person!

08:27.673 --> 08:31.469
Hey, exile! Keep it movin'.

08:31.552 --> 08:34.597
Shoo, shoo!

08:42.480 --> 08:44.899
Wow, gorgeous!

08:44.982 --> 08:49.570
Thank you! I'm Olf!
One lonely fern.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.280
Whoa, hey!

08:51.364 --> 08:53.366
They told me there were
no plants up here.

08:53.449 --> 08:55.117
Who told you that?
Was it Polly?

08:55.201 --> 08:57.703
Did she say that?
Wow, all right, okay.

08:57.787 --> 09:01.540
I'm not surprised.
Some fronds they are.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.751
Ah, sorry, and you are?

09:03.834 --> 09:07.255
Well, I was told I was a savior
but I goofed it up.

09:07.338 --> 09:11.550
Then they said I was a hunter
and I messed that up even more!

09:11.634 --> 09:13.761
Now they have exiled me
to this mountain

09:13.844 --> 09:17.557
because I destroyed
this beautiful island.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.644
Stupid Barb!

09:21.727 --> 09:24.563
Stupid Barb!
Stupid Barb! Stupid Barb!

09:24.647 --> 09:27.400
Don't you think it's unfair
to beat yourself up like that?

09:27.483 --> 09:30.987
You're already battling so much,
why fight yourself, too?

09:31.070 --> 09:33.698
There must be some things
within yourself that you like.

09:33.781 --> 09:35.449
What are your strengths?

09:35.533 --> 09:37.952
My strengths? Ah!

09:38.035 --> 09:41.956
I can hang upside down
and punch like this.

09:42.039 --> 09:44.750
And with this feather,
rather than harm,

09:44.834 --> 09:46.669
I repurposed it to disarm.

09:46.752 --> 09:49.880
And!
Barb can speak in third person!

09:49.964 --> 09:54.385
In fact, she spoke it
into existence herself.

09:54.468 --> 09:56.304
That's it!

09:56.387 --> 10:00.141
Everyone's been telling me
who I am, but I am new!

10:00.224 --> 10:03.477
I'm something that's never
existed before!

10:03.561 --> 10:06.147
I'm supposed to come up
with other things

10:06.230 --> 10:09.150
that have
never existed before!

10:09.233 --> 10:11.360
I call it "Newing"!

10:11.444 --> 10:14.822
Never existed wonder
I'm now generating.

10:14.905 --> 10:16.657
"Newing"!

10:16.741 --> 10:18.993
That's a great name!
Can't improve on that.

10:19.076 --> 10:21.704
That a challenge?
I call it "Inventing"!

10:21.787 --> 10:24.832
Which stands for --
in new versions

10:24.915 --> 10:28.961
everything -- nevermind, no.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.216
I am Barb,
and I am an inventor!

10:34.300 --> 10:36.302
Ventor!
Ventor! Ventor!

10:36.385 --> 10:38.512
Whoa!
- And you're clumsy.

10:38.596 --> 10:42.767
Mind your own beeswax, Olf!
Oh, sorry, Olf.

10:42.850 --> 10:44.644
That was rude of me.

10:44.727 --> 10:46.896
Oof.

10:46.979 --> 10:50.191
I'm clumsy, I'm irritable,
and I'm hungry.

10:50.274 --> 10:54.570
I probably just need to close
my eyes for eight to 10 hours.

10:56.113 --> 11:00.201
I know just the invention
to help those bears.

11:18.302 --> 11:20.846
Huh, uh, boots.
