WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:08.033
Everything's changed.
Now Rob's left his job

00:08.100 --> 00:09.267
because he wanted to.

00:09.333 --> 00:11.233
He wasn't fired or laid off.

00:11.300 --> 00:13.133
He just felt like it.

00:14.333 --> 00:16.600
So we have to move house,
into a smaller house,

00:16.667 --> 00:18.267
which is, I mean it's not
the end of the world.

00:18.333 --> 00:19.933
You know, there's rooms
we don't use.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.367
But it's stressful.
It's emotional.

00:22.433 --> 00:24.800
Um, our daughter
was born there.

00:24.867 --> 00:26.433
- No, she wasn't.
- Yep.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.100
Well, she was born
while we lived there,

00:29.167 --> 00:31.167
so it's all she knows.

00:31.233 --> 00:33.233
I've had to go back to work,

00:33.300 --> 00:34.967
which, you know, he--
Rob made that choice for us.

00:35.033 --> 00:36.433
I mean,
it's the right choice.

00:36.500 --> 00:39.433
Well, we all
make choices, honey.

00:40.700 --> 00:41.767
Don't we, Anthony?

00:41.833 --> 00:44.467
Yeah. Of course we all do.

00:44.533 --> 00:47.533
Uh, so you want
to put the house
on the market, yeah?

00:47.600 --> 00:49.400
Yeah. So I'd say it's worth
a fair amount now,

00:49.467 --> 00:51.300
isn't it, our house?
We painted it.

00:51.367 --> 00:53.433
It's all Deluxe Heritage
colors now, isn't it?

00:53.500 --> 00:54.733
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

00:54.800 --> 00:55.833
We bought it

00:55.900 --> 00:57.300
about two and a half
years ago,

00:57.367 --> 00:58.800
so I'd say it's value is--
[whistle]

00:58.867 --> 01:01.000
Yeah, I got you a great
price for that, I remember.

01:01.067 --> 01:03.000
But, um, right now I'd say

01:03.067 --> 01:04.433
it's not gonna
be worth a lot more

01:04.500 --> 01:06.567
than what you paid for it.

01:06.633 --> 01:09.200
How much not a lot more?

01:09.267 --> 01:11.467
Well, it's all sort of
dropped off a bit, ain't it?

01:11.533 --> 01:13.300
Since the old Brexit nonsense.

01:13.367 --> 01:16.900
If I'm honest, now is not
a good time to sell.

01:16.967 --> 01:20.633
If I were you, I'd just
sort of leave it for a while.

01:20.700 --> 01:22.033
[phone buzzes]

01:25.167 --> 01:27.867
Just out of curiosity,

01:27.933 --> 01:30.433
if it is such
a worthless shit hole,

01:30.500 --> 01:32.367
why did you make us buy it
in the first place?

01:32.433 --> 01:34.333
We didn't make you
buy it, did we?

01:34.400 --> 01:35.567
I remember you telling us

01:35.633 --> 01:37.033
we were making
a great investment.

01:37.100 --> 01:38.200
Yeah, you were.

01:38.267 --> 01:39.767
Look, it is
a great investment.

01:39.833 --> 01:42.167
Just sounds to me like you're
contradicting yourself.

01:42.233 --> 01:43.900
I'm just telling you
the market reality.

01:43.967 --> 01:45.500
Rob:
The market reality?

01:45.567 --> 01:47.267
How you gonna get a good rate
with an attitude like that?

01:47.333 --> 01:48.667
You know, what about
positive thinking?

01:48.733 --> 01:50.700
I mean, you gotta
jazz it up, buddy.

01:50.767 --> 01:52.233
Yeah.
And why are you smiling?

01:52.300 --> 01:53.833
You're telling us
bad news.

01:53.900 --> 01:55.733
You should do that
with a somber face

01:55.800 --> 01:57.200
or a neutral one.

01:57.267 --> 01:59.133
It just doesn't seem
like you're a serious person.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.133
All the smiling,
your clothes.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.233
You're at work,

02:02.300 --> 02:03.533
People make life decisions
in here,

02:03.600 --> 02:05.733
and you're sitting there
all trussed up.

02:05.800 --> 02:07.833
You look like a magician.

02:07.900 --> 02:09.600
Because of the jewelry.

02:12.633 --> 02:13.867
[sigh]

02:13.933 --> 02:16.933
So do we take a sign with us
to stick in our lawn?

02:17.000 --> 02:18.767
Nah, we've got a guy.

02:18.833 --> 02:19.767
Cool.

02:25.533 --> 02:27.900
So if you think
you like the house,

02:27.967 --> 02:31.267
I should say that I received
an offer last week

02:31.333 --> 02:34.933
from two men--
uh, brothers, I think.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.200
They had the same haircut.

02:37.267 --> 02:39.467
Um, they may just have
been roommates.

02:39.533 --> 02:40.800
Eh, probably.

02:40.867 --> 02:42.100
They said
they were dancers.

02:42.167 --> 02:43.333
- Oh.
- In any case, though,

02:43.400 --> 02:44.967
they were talking
about knocking this down

02:45.033 --> 02:46.233
and ripping that out.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.700
What? That's nuts.
This house is great.

02:48.767 --> 02:52.300
Thank you. Yes, my wife
had a flair for design.

02:52.367 --> 02:55.267
You can't buy carpets
this color anymore.

02:55.333 --> 02:58.167
- It's a very bright brown.
- Mm. Persian,

02:58.233 --> 03:01.700
or, as you young people
call it now, Iran. [chuckle]

03:01.767 --> 03:05.100
We used to call it Persia.
That was good enough for us.

03:05.167 --> 03:07.333
So, uh, would you like
a drink of any kind?

03:07.400 --> 03:09.267
Oh, yeah. I'll--
I'll have a tea,

03:09.333 --> 03:10.967
uh, with lemon,
thank you, Wallace.

03:11.033 --> 03:12.100
Uh, Robert?

03:12.167 --> 03:14.300
Uh, no.
I'm good, thank you.

03:15.667 --> 03:17.833
Tea with lemon?

03:17.900 --> 03:19.467
Shut up.

03:19.533 --> 03:20.467
What do you think?

03:20.533 --> 03:22.100
Do you think
his wife died here?

03:22.167 --> 03:24.067
Who cares?
It's charming as fuck.

03:24.133 --> 03:25.433
I think I love it.

03:25.500 --> 03:28.433
Can I show you
one thing very quickly?

03:28.500 --> 03:29.433
Yeah.

03:32.833 --> 03:34.500
What are you doing?

03:35.767 --> 03:37.267
Very uncomfortable.

03:37.333 --> 03:40.267
Right. Well, maybe
learn to take a shit
in under 20 minutes?

03:40.333 --> 03:42.200
That's ridiculous
and impossible.

03:42.267 --> 03:44.433
I really like this house.
I swear to God,

03:44.500 --> 03:46.133
if you knocked through
that pokey kitchen

03:46.200 --> 03:47.767
into that ridiculous
little scullery,

03:47.833 --> 03:49.267
you'd take away
a lot of the--

03:49.333 --> 03:51.600
charm of the sort of--

03:51.667 --> 03:53.433
you know, how it's
like a cozy maze.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.400
So I don't know

03:54.467 --> 03:56.100
what those dancers
were talking about.

03:57.367 --> 03:59.333
Do you feel bad that we
lied to an old man?

03:59.400 --> 04:00.967
I feel bad
that you lied to him.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.433
I mean, I was
just standing there

04:02.500 --> 04:04.100
while you told him we had
a mortgage ready to go.

04:04.167 --> 04:05.633
Well, it might be lie today,

04:05.700 --> 04:08.633
but it's not gonna be a lie
next week, maybe, I think.

04:09.933 --> 04:11.733
I like this little area,
do you?

04:11.800 --> 04:12.767
Sure.

04:12.833 --> 04:14.167
It's a great house.

04:14.233 --> 04:16.000
I mean, I thought I was
gonna be embarrassed--

04:16.067 --> 04:17.433
you know, moving
into a tiny house,

04:17.500 --> 04:20.000
but that house is just--
almost feels like a choice.

04:20.067 --> 04:21.167
Ha.

04:21.233 --> 04:22.767
How long do you think
to sell our house?

04:22.833 --> 04:24.733
I don't know, but even
if we get the asking price,

04:24.800 --> 04:27.400
it's gonna be tight if we want
to get somewhere in this area.

04:27.467 --> 04:29.200
Yeah, well, maybe it's not
just selling the house.

04:29.267 --> 04:30.700
Maybe we need
to start thinking

04:30.767 --> 04:32.100
about paring back our lives.

04:32.167 --> 04:33.500
I mean I'll be
happy to downsize.

04:33.567 --> 04:35.667
I'm a pretty simple
person, and--

04:35.733 --> 04:37.267
Why are you doing that
with your face?

04:37.333 --> 04:39.100
Sorry. Just my eyes
rolled back so fast,

04:39.167 --> 04:41.000
it actually pulled
my skull backwards.

04:41.067 --> 04:42.433
You're not a simple person.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.700
I am. I'm Irish.
We're simple people.

04:44.767 --> 04:47.533
Uh, an Irish milkmaid
is a simple person.

04:47.600 --> 04:49.700
You're a cosmopolitan
clothes fiend

04:49.767 --> 04:52.733
who consciously left Ireland
to come here and shop.

04:54.700 --> 04:56.633
Do you really think
I'm cosmopolitan?

04:56.700 --> 04:57.967
[laughing]

04:58.033 --> 05:00.500
Well, how about,
as a sort of interim

05:00.567 --> 05:02.933
kind of a cash flow
sort of a thing,

05:03.000 --> 05:05.333
and, I mean,
this might sound crazy,

05:05.400 --> 05:08.533
but I'll remind you
it was your idea.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.167
What if, per your idea,

05:11.233 --> 05:14.733
I did become
a big and tall model?

05:14.800 --> 05:15.933
I mean, it was crazy then,

05:16.000 --> 05:18.100
but now I weigh
at least 20 pounds more,

05:18.167 --> 05:20.433
so I really am big and tall,

05:20.500 --> 05:22.467
so maybe it's not
as crazy as I thought.

05:22.533 --> 05:24.667
- [chuckle]
- What? It was your idea.

05:24.733 --> 05:27.367
Yeah, I'm not sure
I was being serious.

05:27.433 --> 05:29.700
I think I was probably
flirting with you.

05:29.767 --> 05:32.000
You said nice things to me
when we first met.

05:32.067 --> 05:33.533
I meant those nice things.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.367
Yeah, well, they were tailored
to get into my knickers.

05:35.433 --> 05:36.767
I didn't have to say
anything special

05:36.833 --> 05:38.133
to get into your knickers.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.367
I just had to say "Hello"
or "Remove your knickers."

05:40.433 --> 05:43.867
Well, look, yeah.
Give it a go.

05:43.933 --> 05:45.467
I mean, you are--
you're big and tall.

05:45.533 --> 05:47.167
They'd be lucky
to have you.

05:47.233 --> 05:49.467
Just make sure you tell them
you won't model fur.

05:49.533 --> 05:51.133
What about leather?

05:51.200 --> 05:52.867
All you're gonna get
is leather work.

05:52.933 --> 05:54.500
[laughing]

05:54.567 --> 05:56.900
You could cancel
your gym membership.

05:56.967 --> 05:59.033
Not if I'm gonna be a model.

06:00.100 --> 06:01.367
[grunt]

06:02.733 --> 06:04.067
That's right.

06:05.400 --> 06:07.067
[groaning]

06:08.533 --> 06:10.200
Come on, you pussy.

06:11.533 --> 06:13.767
Oh, mother fuck.

06:13.833 --> 06:15.400
Ah.

06:15.467 --> 06:17.200
I need to stop.

06:17.267 --> 06:19.633
I don't want to get
too ripped on day 1.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.500
Too late, baby.

06:23.367 --> 06:24.700
I haven't seen you
for a while.

06:24.767 --> 06:27.833
Uh, yeah.
I used my membership
so little last year

06:27.900 --> 06:30.933
that it worked out
to about 70 quid a visit.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.567
I can't afford that.

06:35.067 --> 06:37.233
- Sell your house yet?
- Uh, not yet

06:37.300 --> 06:38.667
but we just hired a guy

06:38.733 --> 06:40.467
who wears a lot of really
beautiful jewelry

06:40.533 --> 06:42.033
to sell it,

06:42.100 --> 06:44.100
so it should
fly off the shelf now.

06:44.167 --> 06:46.067
Fran came to see me
last night.

06:46.133 --> 06:48.833
Looks like we've reached
a settlement détente.

06:48.900 --> 06:50.700
She wants an amicable divorce.

06:50.767 --> 06:52.100
That's nice.

06:52.167 --> 06:53.400
Ah, when your life
falls apart,

06:53.467 --> 06:55.167
it's nice
to keep things nice.

06:55.233 --> 06:57.333
I'm gonna give her
half of everything--

06:58.767 --> 06:59.733
including Jeffrey.

07:04.367 --> 07:06.300
What's happening
with you and Sharon?

07:06.367 --> 07:09.267
You all squared with her
snake handling, so to speak?

07:09.333 --> 07:11.400
Yeah. We're okay.
It's getting better.

07:11.467 --> 07:13.667
And honestly, at this
point in our marriage,

07:13.733 --> 07:15.667
if she makes a mistake,
it just gives me leverage

07:15.733 --> 07:17.000
for whatever monstrous thing

07:17.067 --> 07:18.600
I'll definitely do
next month.

07:19.567 --> 07:23.167
Marriage is like
a game of chess,

07:23.233 --> 07:24.900
but the board
is made of water,

07:24.967 --> 07:26.467
and the pieces
are made of smoke.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.467
- Who said that?
- I said it.

07:28.533 --> 07:30.033
No, you didn't.

07:32.867 --> 07:34.533
Jerry Seinfeld said that.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.333
He said it, too,
but who said it first?

07:36.400 --> 07:38.433
- He did.
- Yeah, but who just said it?

07:41.367 --> 07:42.533
Spot me.

07:49.367 --> 07:51.633
You have a lovely home.

07:51.700 --> 07:53.633
[chuckle]
Well, thank you.

07:53.700 --> 07:55.700
I don't think I've
ever had the pleasure

07:55.767 --> 07:59.733
of two such beautiful ladies
on one social call.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.600
So healthy.

08:01.667 --> 08:02.700
Oh, I like you.

08:02.767 --> 08:04.233
Do you come with the house?

08:04.300 --> 08:07.367
Uh, no, no. I-- I hope,
when I sell this place,

08:07.433 --> 08:09.667
to move into a small
apartment in town.

08:09.733 --> 08:13.033
I'd like to be a little,
um, closer to the action.

08:13.100 --> 08:15.000
- Oh.
- And they'll find me sooner

08:15.067 --> 08:17.033
if I die at home by myself.

08:17.100 --> 08:18.867
Oh, don't say that.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.567
I'm sure someone
would find you here.

08:20.633 --> 08:22.033
Oh, you're too kind.

08:22.100 --> 08:24.967
Uh, so I'll wait
to hear from you.

08:25.033 --> 08:27.467
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll just, um...

08:27.533 --> 08:29.733
Yeah, we'll just
sort the-- Yeah.

08:31.767 --> 08:34.800
Oh, I often think it might be
nice to be with an older guy.

08:34.867 --> 08:36.133
They just know more.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.133
Really? They don't seem
like they know more.

08:38.200 --> 08:39.800
Actually, they're a lot
closer to knowing less.

08:39.867 --> 08:41.767
Oh, I don't know.
Experience counts.

08:41.833 --> 08:43.567
They'd know their way
around a woman's body.

08:43.633 --> 08:46.667
Stop saying stuff like that
and looking over at Wallace.

08:46.733 --> 08:48.700
What do you think of it?

08:48.767 --> 08:50.133
Well, if you have to move,

08:50.200 --> 08:51.700
it seems like a good
a place as any.

08:51.767 --> 08:54.267
Could Rob just
not save you both
all this grief

08:54.333 --> 08:55.800
and go back to his job?

08:55.867 --> 08:57.967
It seems like he's being
a wee bit of a selfish shit.

08:58.033 --> 08:59.667
Yeah,
but he hated it there.

08:59.733 --> 09:01.067
I mean,
he really hated it,

09:01.133 --> 09:03.067
and I don't currently
occupy the moral high ground

09:03.133 --> 09:04.767
because of the--
ck-ck-- so...

09:04.833 --> 09:06.600
There's fireplaces
in all the bedrooms.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.600
Oh, Game of Thrones.

09:08.667 --> 09:11.033
You can make love in front
of every one of them.

09:11.100 --> 09:12.800
Hey, thanks for doing this.

09:12.867 --> 09:14.300
Nothing else to do.

09:14.367 --> 09:16.200
I kicked Patrick out
last week.

09:16.267 --> 09:18.467
Oh, I'm sorry.
He was awful.

09:18.533 --> 09:19.967
I'm getting straight back
on the horse, though.

09:20.033 --> 09:21.800
- Going right back out there.
- Well, good for you.

09:21.867 --> 09:23.533
Just gonna have a little
nip and tuck first.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.900
Really?

09:24.967 --> 09:26.400
- Why?
- It's tough out there,

09:26.467 --> 09:28.267
and you catch a lot more
flies with honey than shit.

09:28.333 --> 09:31.033
I mean, I'm not saying
that this is shit,

09:31.100 --> 09:32.700
but I'd like
a little more honey.

09:32.767 --> 09:35.333
Is that true? Catch more
flies with honey than shit?

09:35.400 --> 09:37.000
Isn't shit, like,
they're favorite thing?

09:38.267 --> 09:39.633
What's he doing?

09:41.167 --> 09:42.800
Sharon: Oh.

09:42.867 --> 09:44.467
Hi.

09:44.533 --> 09:45.467
[mouthing]

09:48.767 --> 09:50.567
[chuckling] Aw.

09:50.633 --> 09:53.700
You've got two
original fireplaces,

09:53.767 --> 09:54.867
original wood flooring.

09:54.933 --> 09:55.933
Man: It's parquet, right?

09:56.000 --> 09:57.100
Yeah, that's parquet,
that.

09:57.167 --> 09:58.667
When you add that
to your great schools

09:58.733 --> 10:00.367
and your transport links,
you can't really go wrong.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.100
Well, we're gonna have
a look upstairs now, yeah?

10:02.167 --> 10:03.433
- Help yourself.
- Great house.

10:03.500 --> 10:05.067
Oh, thank you.
Enjoy the bedrooms.

10:05.133 --> 10:06.333
If there's any dirty
knickers on the floor,

10:06.400 --> 10:07.600
just kick them
under the bed.

10:07.667 --> 10:08.733
I mean, there won't be.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.300
We knew you were coming.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.233
Added features...

10:13.300 --> 10:15.467
- Do you think they like it?
- I don't know.

10:15.533 --> 10:17.133
Do you think they'll
put an offer in?

10:17.200 --> 10:18.267
Yeah, no, I know.
You don't know.

10:18.333 --> 10:19.633
Fuck. It's nerve-wracking.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.800
I went to see Wallace's
place again with Fran.

10:21.867 --> 10:24.133
He asked if we were
full steam ahead. I didn't
know what to tell him.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.433
The truth-- that we're not?

10:26.500 --> 10:28.333
I mean, we don't even have
an offer on this place yet.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.000
Yeah, but he's put an offer
in on his bachelor pad.

10:30.067 --> 10:31.600
Well,
tell him not to do that.

10:31.667 --> 10:33.767
Why? Look, if we get
Wallace's place,

10:33.833 --> 10:35.467
it's gonna take the money
pressure off, right?

10:35.533 --> 10:37.033
Yeah, but we don't even
have a mortgage yet.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.400
Yeah, but we will.

10:38.467 --> 10:40.367
We're asking for half
the mortgage we got now.

10:40.433 --> 10:42.133
Let's just do it.
Let's go for it.

10:42.200 --> 10:43.367
We're gonna sell this place.

10:43.433 --> 10:45.433
I mean, look at it.
Look at our cushions.

10:45.500 --> 10:48.867
I'd buy it if I didn't already
own it or could afford it.

10:48.933 --> 10:50.667
It's nuts we've had
no offers yet.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.200
We should put it on
with another estate
agent. He's an idiot.

10:53.267 --> 10:56.433
What does he do up there,
take a nap with them?

10:56.500 --> 10:59.667
[laughing] Or like, uh,
put on a magic show?

10:59.733 --> 11:01.800
That's
probably what he does.

11:01.867 --> 11:03.033
We should call him
David Blaine,

11:03.100 --> 11:04.600
like, between us,
like, to each other.

11:04.667 --> 11:06.333
David Blaine it is.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.333
Sharon: Fran told me she's
getting some work done.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.567
- On her house?
- No, on her face.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.333
Christ,
why is she doing that?

11:16.400 --> 11:20.167
I don't know. Because she's
in her mid-40s and single

11:20.233 --> 11:21.900
and it's grim out there.

11:21.967 --> 11:24.900
So she wants to look more
like an angry, surprised alien

11:24.967 --> 11:26.267
when she meets new guys?

11:27.667 --> 11:29.800
Don't you do anything
to your face.

11:29.867 --> 11:31.167
Okay.

11:31.233 --> 11:33.200
I'm serious. Never
ever touch your face.

11:33.267 --> 11:35.667
Well, you know,
I don't plan to,

11:35.733 --> 11:37.367
but if, down the road,

11:37.433 --> 11:39.667
there was a procedure
that didn't hurt

11:39.733 --> 11:41.467
- and it was guaranteed--
- Look, look, no, listen.

11:41.533 --> 11:42.900
I want to fuck you.

11:42.967 --> 11:44.467
- Do you?
- Yeah,

11:44.533 --> 11:45.600
because you're like

11:45.667 --> 11:47.833
"This is it,
take it or leave it."

11:47.900 --> 11:49.467
It's like bald guys.

11:49.533 --> 11:52.067
Women and gay guys don't
give a shit if a guy's bald

11:52.133 --> 11:55.200
if he's like "I'm a man,
I'm fucking bald,

11:55.267 --> 11:56.767
and that's how it is."

11:56.833 --> 12:00.067
Then you're like
"Gimme that dick,
you bald asshole."

12:01.033 --> 12:02.033
Yeah, that's true.

12:02.100 --> 12:03.633
Don't you go bald, though.

12:03.700 --> 12:04.700
Okay.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.467
So there's nothing
about me you'd change?

12:10.533 --> 12:12.333
- What?
- No, I mean surgically.

12:12.400 --> 12:13.600
There's nothing about me

12:13.667 --> 12:15.533
you'd surgically change
if you could?

12:15.600 --> 12:16.767
No.

12:16.833 --> 12:18.667
Not even my saggy tits?

12:18.733 --> 12:20.933
- They're not saggy.
- Yeah, they are.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.333
I was bending over, getting
out the bath the other day,

12:23.400 --> 12:26.133
and Frankie pointed at them
and said "Tubes."

12:26.200 --> 12:27.967
Fuck Frankie.

12:28.033 --> 12:30.233
Look, are they
less like the breasts

12:30.300 --> 12:32.300
I would've drawn on my
notebook in high school?

12:32.367 --> 12:35.400
Maybe, but are they
attached to you?

12:35.467 --> 12:38.367
Are they still a couple feet
above an amazing pussy?

12:40.600 --> 12:42.633
That's the nicest thing
you've said to me in weeks.

12:43.967 --> 12:45.233
[phone buzzes]

12:46.733 --> 12:49.933
Oh. It's Wallace.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.467
It's 10 past 11.

12:51.533 --> 12:53.400
Yeah. He's old,

12:53.467 --> 12:55.367
so he doesn't
know how to text.

12:55.433 --> 12:57.500
I think he's just lonely,
and he likes me.

12:57.567 --> 13:00.200
He's like the grandpa
I never had.

13:00.267 --> 13:01.467
I mean, I had grandpas,

13:01.533 --> 13:04.200
but they were more,
you know, drunker.

13:04.267 --> 13:06.000
You're not gonna answer it?

13:06.067 --> 13:08.667
No. It's fucking 10 past 11.

13:11.367 --> 13:13.367
** [dance beat]

13:28.433 --> 13:29.500
[puff]

13:51.867 --> 13:53.133
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:55.133 --> 13:56.467
- Mm.
- Mm.

13:56.533 --> 13:58.833
You know, I'm just gonna
grab a couple for my kids.

13:58.900 --> 14:00.200
Yeah, sure.

14:02.767 --> 14:03.900
[beep]

14:03.967 --> 14:06.200
Um, my pass thing isn't--

14:06.267 --> 14:07.633
Let's have a look.
May I see it?

14:08.867 --> 14:10.533
Um...

14:10.600 --> 14:11.533
[beep]

14:11.600 --> 14:13.200
Oh, it says
we charged your card

14:13.267 --> 14:14.767
for the membership
for the last quarter,

14:14.833 --> 14:16.733
- and it didn't go through.
- Oh, that's weird.

14:16.800 --> 14:20.067
Uh, you know, my other
card is in my car.

14:20.133 --> 14:21.733
Do you mind if I
pop out and grab that?

14:21.800 --> 14:22.933
Sure.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.133
[beep]

14:39.967 --> 14:42.033
I've thought about
vaginal rejuvenation,

14:42.100 --> 14:43.833
but I've been pretty good
with my kegals,

14:43.900 --> 14:45.400
and I've only had one child--

14:45.467 --> 14:48.767
a son--
the actor Jeffrey Baisley?

14:50.700 --> 14:53.333
So I'm doing pretty good
in that department.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.467
We don't do vaginal
rejuvenation here anyway.

14:56.533 --> 14:58.300
Oh, good.

14:58.367 --> 15:00.400
So, um...

15:02.067 --> 15:05.533
what were you, uh,
thinking of?

15:05.600 --> 15:08.133
Uh, well I--
I was thinking of my chin.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.000
There's nothing wrong
with your chin.

15:10.067 --> 15:12.100
Or not my chin, my jowls.

15:12.167 --> 15:14.600
Get these bits lifted up,
up and away.

15:14.667 --> 15:15.833
I try and keep my hair short

15:15.900 --> 15:17.067
to try
and not draw attention--

15:17.133 --> 15:18.967
Why would you do that?

15:19.033 --> 15:22.000
I don't know where
you got the insane idea

15:22.067 --> 15:23.500
that you need to do this.

15:23.567 --> 15:27.567
Television, magazines,
ads on the tube.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.000
Uh--

15:30.067 --> 15:33.067
Maybe just inject
a wee bit of botox like--

15:34.100 --> 15:36.367
Yes. I could.

15:36.433 --> 15:39.133
Maybe after,
I'll nip to the Louvre,

15:39.200 --> 15:43.100
paint a little petunia
in the Mona Lisa's hair.

15:43.167 --> 15:44.533
- Sorry?
- I wouldn't do that.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.567
You know why?
She's a masterpiece.

15:46.633 --> 15:47.600
Doesn't need it.

15:49.133 --> 15:50.300
Neither do you.

15:51.733 --> 15:52.767
Oh.

15:58.533 --> 16:00.100
Uh...

16:00.167 --> 16:02.133
back in a minute.

16:03.733 --> 16:06.133
Excuse me. Oh. Sorry.

16:06.200 --> 16:09.300
Uh, I wanted to, um--

16:09.367 --> 16:12.867
Look, maybe you've just got
a very good bedside manner

16:12.933 --> 16:14.233
and I have
misinterpreted this,

16:14.300 --> 16:16.100
but since my husband
left me,

16:16.167 --> 16:19.567
my motto is--
well, I don't have a motto.

16:19.633 --> 16:21.033
I'm not a netball club.

16:21.100 --> 16:24.933
But it's nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.233
So...

16:29.433 --> 16:30.467
Sorry.

16:33.533 --> 16:36.200
"I have a little shadow
that goes in and out with me."

16:36.267 --> 16:38.600
"And what can be the use of him
is more than I can see."

16:38.667 --> 16:41.167
"He's very very like me
from the heels up to the head."

16:41.233 --> 16:42.200
[phone jangles]

16:42.267 --> 16:43.800
"And I see him
jump before me

16:43.867 --> 16:45.367
when I jump into my bed."

16:45.433 --> 16:47.033
"The funniest thing about him is
the way he likes..."

16:47.100 --> 16:48.600
Um, I can't talk
unless it's an emergency.

16:48.667 --> 16:50.767
- Is it an emergency?
- No, I'm just--

16:50.833 --> 16:52.100
It's an emergency. Sorry.

16:52.167 --> 16:54.267
I have an emergency.

16:55.433 --> 16:57.667
[girls continue
reciting "My Shadow"]

16:57.733 --> 16:58.967
Hey, what did they say?

16:59.033 --> 17:00.267
I'm just heading
into the bank now.

17:00.333 --> 17:02.700
Oh, okay.
Well, it'll be fine.

17:02.767 --> 17:04.367
Just thank them for
the huge mortgage we have,

17:04.433 --> 17:05.967
and tell them
we want to trade it in
for a smaller one.

17:06.033 --> 17:07.533
- It's so simple.
- Yep.

17:07.600 --> 17:09.200
It's not like we're
trying to fleece anybody.

17:09.267 --> 17:10.467
We're just trying
to be responsible adults.

17:10.533 --> 17:12.400
- Yeah.
- Treating us like criminals.

17:12.467 --> 17:14.200
- I haven't even gone in yet.
- Okay. Sorry

17:14.267 --> 17:16.533
Um, well, look, um, good luck.

17:16.600 --> 17:17.567
Call me.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.333
Fuck.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.700
Hey! I'm sitting here!

17:31.800 --> 17:34.233
Fucking jerk.

17:41.767 --> 17:43.067
Hey. Hi, Dan.

17:43.133 --> 17:44.500
Uh, it's Rob.
I just want to-

17:44.567 --> 17:46.433
Hey, Rob. Yeah, I was
just about to call you.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.900
Well, great.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.133
Yeah, it didn't
go your way with Glenco.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.667
- Right.
- Yeah. Apparently,

17:50.733 --> 17:52.267
they had mostly
hired this other guy

17:52.333 --> 17:53.533
before they saw you,

17:53.600 --> 17:55.100
but then they still really
wanted to see you,

17:55.167 --> 17:56.633
uh, but then meeting you,

17:56.700 --> 17:58.567
uh, didn't make them
change their mind

17:58.633 --> 18:00.033
about the other guy.

18:00.100 --> 18:01.233
Does that make sense?

18:01.300 --> 18:03.167
Does that make sense? No.

18:03.233 --> 18:05.333
They knew they had
the guy that they wanted,

18:05.400 --> 18:07.300
but they still
strung me along for a week?

18:07.367 --> 18:08.833
No, no,
that doesn't make sense

18:08.900 --> 18:10.733
in answer to your query.

18:17.700 --> 18:19.000
[sigh]

18:22.167 --> 18:24.533
[phone jangling]

18:26.033 --> 18:27.300
[jangling]

18:29.100 --> 18:30.033
Hey.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.767
Hey, Dave, you busy?

18:31.833 --> 18:33.267
Not really. What's up?

18:33.333 --> 18:37.233
Well, I was wondering
if you knew of any people

18:37.300 --> 18:39.200
that might be able
to help me with a mortgage

18:39.267 --> 18:41.567
that operate outside

18:41.633 --> 18:44.200
of the traditional
banking realm.

18:44.267 --> 18:46.467
Uh, yeah, I definitely do.

18:46.533 --> 18:47.667
Well, great.

18:47.733 --> 18:49.967
Yeah, but I think what sets
them apart from a bank

18:50.033 --> 18:51.200
is their interest rates

18:51.267 --> 18:53.433
aren't super competitive,

18:53.500 --> 18:55.533
and if you're late for a
payment, they will kill you,

18:55.600 --> 18:57.567
and there'd be no funeral
and no wake

18:57.633 --> 18:59.400
because your body
wouldn't be found.

18:59.467 --> 19:01.767
I mean, you could
have a memorial service,

19:01.833 --> 19:03.033
but there'd be no body.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.200
Uh, does that make sense?

19:07.167 --> 19:08.133
[door closes]

19:08.200 --> 19:09.900
Rob: I didn't get that job.

19:09.967 --> 19:11.567
Oh, fuck.

19:11.633 --> 19:14.433
Oh, shit.
How did it go with the--

19:14.500 --> 19:16.233
And they're not gonna
give us a mortgage.

19:16.300 --> 19:18.633
- What?
- He said the biggest
mortgage we could get

19:18.700 --> 19:19.967
was for a stereo.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.267
Why would he say that?

19:21.333 --> 19:23.267
He didn't say that,
but it turns out

19:23.333 --> 19:25.533
that a schoolteacher
and a house husband

19:25.600 --> 19:28.100
don't qualify for a mortgage
of the size that we need.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.733
For people in our position,

19:29.800 --> 19:33.567
a more realistic time to get
a mortgage would be 2007.

19:33.633 --> 19:36.000
We didn't even know
each other then.

19:37.467 --> 19:38.967
So what--

19:39.033 --> 19:40.667
Why are you wearing
no trousers?

19:40.733 --> 19:42.333
Because on top
of everything else,

19:42.400 --> 19:43.967
I'm fat now and they hurt,

19:44.033 --> 19:45.700
so when I got home,
I threw them away.

19:45.767 --> 19:49.567
Oh, Christ.

19:49.633 --> 19:51.267
This is terrible news.

19:51.333 --> 19:53.033
So what now? I mean, what--

19:53.100 --> 19:54.633
Oh, shit. What about Wallace?

19:54.700 --> 19:55.833
What about Wallace?

19:55.900 --> 19:57.100
No, I know it's not as--

19:57.167 --> 19:58.467
But I just--

19:58.533 --> 20:01.833
I feel awful.
His little bachelor pad.

20:01.900 --> 20:03.300
Mm, sorry our shitty lives

20:03.367 --> 20:04.767
are now making
somebody else's worse.

20:04.833 --> 20:06.800
- He could die soon.
- We're not a hospice.

20:06.867 --> 20:08.933
- You're gonna have to tell him.
- You have to tell him.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.300
We feel terrible
about this.

20:11.367 --> 20:13.267
We feel sick, honestly.

20:13.333 --> 20:15.233
It's a-- It's
a terrible situation

20:15.300 --> 20:16.633
for-- for everyone,

20:16.700 --> 20:17.833
I mean we're devastated--

20:17.900 --> 20:20.567
not just for us,
but for letting you down.

20:20.633 --> 20:23.933
You know, when our daughter
Muireann was born,

20:24.000 --> 20:25.267
I said to Sharon--

20:25.333 --> 20:27.533
Are you mentally retarded?

20:27.600 --> 20:29.733
No, I'm not.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.400
So just an idiot and a liar.

20:32.467 --> 20:34.333
You-- You--
You don't have a job,

20:34.400 --> 20:36.833
but you thought
you could get a mortgage?

20:36.900 --> 20:39.067
Well, no, but Sharon--

20:39.133 --> 20:41.467
No. No, no.

20:41.533 --> 20:44.267
I'm going to sue you.
You shook my hand.

20:44.333 --> 20:46.667
You can't sue us
for shaking your hand.

20:46.733 --> 20:50.133
I fought at Suez, and that
wasn't half as upsetting

20:50.200 --> 20:51.833
as what you people
are putting me through.

20:51.900 --> 20:53.367
We-- We brought you
cupcakes.

20:53.433 --> 20:56.400
[scoff] You're liars,
stupid liars.

20:56.467 --> 20:58.133
Well, look, we really
hope this doesn't mean

20:58.200 --> 20:59.300
you've lost
your apartment in town.

20:59.367 --> 21:00.867
Oh, it better fucking not!

21:00.933 --> 21:02.733
Well, we're very sorry.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.000
I'm going to have to sell the
home I raised my children in

21:05.067 --> 21:06.067
to a pair of faggots.

21:06.133 --> 21:07.600
- Wallace! What?
- Hey, Wallace,

21:07.667 --> 21:10.133
look, we're very sorry
about all of this, okay?

21:10.200 --> 21:11.533
But in actual legal fact,

21:11.600 --> 21:13.433
you have no power
over us, okay?

21:13.500 --> 21:15.433
So this visit,
or the first half of it,

21:15.500 --> 21:17.500
was just to extend you
a courtesy.

21:17.567 --> 21:18.833
We're sorry, okay?

21:18.900 --> 21:20.767
And we hope you don't
wind up on the street

21:20.833 --> 21:21.833
because you look
pretty frail.

21:21.900 --> 21:23.467
Frail? Oh!

21:23.533 --> 21:26.100
I'll kick a cupcake
up your pussy!

21:26.167 --> 21:28.233
Why are you looking at me?

21:28.300 --> 21:30.100
Let's go. Let's just go.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.600
[moaning]

21:34.967 --> 21:37.067
And he definitely doesn't
know where we live?

21:37.133 --> 21:39.833
Not unless
he followed us home.

21:39.900 --> 21:42.333
What are we gonna do?

21:42.400 --> 21:44.000
We keep the doors locked?

21:44.067 --> 21:45.800
I have a big flashlight
under the bed.

21:45.867 --> 21:47.300
I meant about where we live.

21:47.367 --> 21:49.267
I think we're gonna
have to rent somewhere.

21:49.333 --> 21:51.467
Well, we definitely can't
afford to stay here.

21:51.533 --> 21:54.733
We can afford it for, like,
another hour and a half.

21:56.167 --> 21:59.400
Okay. I'm sure--
I'm not definite,

21:59.467 --> 22:01.133
but I'm pretty sure
that I've still got

22:01.200 --> 22:03.000
a Post Office
savings account in Ireland.

22:03.067 --> 22:04.567
I don't know how much
is in there, but--

22:04.633 --> 22:08.667
Is it more or less
than £800,000?

22:08.733 --> 22:10.100
It's less.

22:10.167 --> 22:12.167
Well, then you can just
leave it there, then.

22:24.233 --> 22:25.500
Can I help you?

22:25.567 --> 22:29.167
Um, yeah.
I was just wondering, um,

22:29.233 --> 22:31.833
how to go about, uh,
getting on your books?

22:31.900 --> 22:33.800
In what way?

22:33.867 --> 22:40.567
Uh, well, uh, I'm 6'4",
and I weigh 250 pounds,

22:40.633 --> 22:42.467
and, you know,
it's just something

22:42.533 --> 22:44.867
that my wife thought
that I should see if--

22:44.933 --> 22:46.767
she wondered if, you know,
if it would be worth--

22:48.333 --> 22:49.633
Would that be possible?

22:49.700 --> 22:51.333
I'm afraid we're
not currently looking

22:51.400 --> 22:53.000
to take any new clients
on our books.

22:53.067 --> 22:54.667
Right. Sure.

22:54.733 --> 22:56.433
But thank you.

23:08.767 --> 23:10.067
Thank you.

23:10.133 --> 23:13.667
Hey, Harita,
long time, no, uh...

23:13.733 --> 23:15.033
Well, I just wanted to call

23:15.100 --> 23:16.900
and-- and check in
and see how you're doing.

23:16.967 --> 23:18.367
I hope you had
a nice, um, break.

23:18.433 --> 23:19.833
I think I remember you saying

23:19.900 --> 23:21.933
you were going on a whaling
trip off of Okinawa.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.867
I hope-- hope that was fun.

23:23.933 --> 23:25.333
Um, so yeah, give me a call.

23:25.400 --> 23:26.833
I wanted to talk
about my future,

23:26.900 --> 23:29.200
see if you had any use
for this old bag of bones

23:29.267 --> 23:30.867
around the old shop. So,

23:30.933 --> 23:33.100
yeah, anyway, give me a call.
I miss you guys.
