* If you're happy and you know
it, clap your hands *

00:16.650 --> 00:18.652
* If you're happy and
you know it, clap your hands *

00:18.686 --> 00:20.354
* If you're happy
and you know it *

00:20.388 --> 00:21.789
* Then motherfucking
show it *

00:21.822 --> 00:23.491
* If you're happy
and you know it *

00:23.524 --> 00:24.792
* Clap your
motherfucking hands *

00:24.825 --> 00:26.360
* If you're happy
and you know it *

00:26.394 --> 00:29.097
* Clap your hands!

( Lee wretches )

00:30.431 --> 00:34.468
Thom: So, yesterday, I decided
to quit my job at MGT.

00:34.502 --> 00:36.737
I'm trying to remember
when exactly,

00:36.770 --> 00:38.372
at what point.

00:38.406 --> 00:39.673
It may have been
that morning,

00:39.707 --> 00:44.245
listening to Lee puking
and thinking about my life.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.646
Did I really want
to waste

00:45.679 --> 00:48.249
the rest of my life
writing ads?

00:48.282 --> 00:49.817
( Lee continues retching )

00:49.850 --> 00:51.652
Lee: I mean,
you're the shrink.

00:51.685 --> 00:53.254
You're the psychiatrist.

00:53.287 --> 00:56.857
How do you not know if
the Lexapro makes people puke?

00:56.890 --> 00:58.592
A lot of people.

00:58.626 --> 01:00.694
I mean, you're the doctor.
I went online.

01:00.728 --> 01:03.164
I found this out
in five minutes.

01:03.197 --> 01:06.234
I went to you looking
for some relief, all right?

01:06.267 --> 01:08.336
I went to you because I thought
that maybe you could help me.

01:08.369 --> 01:09.670
But instead what I found

01:09.703 --> 01:13.574
was myself facing
the bottom of a toilet bowl

01:13.607 --> 01:16.277
all fucking night long.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.779
It's 6:30 in the morning.
Call me when you get this.

01:18.812 --> 01:20.548
- ( phone beeps )
- Ugh!

01:20.581 --> 01:22.116
Should I stay home?

01:22.150 --> 01:23.651
No, no, no.
Don't, mm-mm.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.219
I can't stay home.

01:25.253 --> 01:26.387
I don't want you
to stay home.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.589
Got this
agency meeting.

01:28.622 --> 01:31.459
These 25-year-old
Swedish idiots

01:31.492 --> 01:33.361
love agency meetings.

01:33.394 --> 01:34.562
We're a family.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.565
This corporation,
this carnivorous machine

01:37.598 --> 01:38.899
that profits at the expense

01:38.932 --> 01:41.302
of everyone
and everything around it,

01:41.335 --> 01:43.237
they say this is a family.

01:43.271 --> 01:44.805
The Manson Family.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.540
You know,
unless you have kids,

01:46.574 --> 01:47.775
I don't care
how much money you earn,

01:47.808 --> 01:49.710
what company
you're CEO of,

01:49.743 --> 01:51.445
don't call your
fucking company a family.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.847
Thom, go to work.

01:53.881 --> 01:57.385
- I can't stay home.
- I don't want you to stay home.

01:57.418 --> 01:58.519
Should I just stay home?

01:58.552 --> 02:00.754
( sighs )

02:00.788 --> 02:04.625
Thom: Or maybe it was that
I finally started writing.

02:05.759 --> 02:07.861
I had started
writing this story

02:07.895 --> 02:10.331
a couple of days after
Larry killed himself, actually.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.865
I don't know
what it means,

02:11.899 --> 02:14.368
and I haven't got the slightest
idea how to end it.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.903
I'm like God in that way--

02:15.936 --> 02:18.639
great at starting worlds,
no idea how to end them,

02:18.672 --> 02:21.575
and not really sure
they mean anything anyway.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.644
The story is called...

02:23.677 --> 02:25.646
"Skidmark Jesus."

02:28.349 --> 02:30.751
It's about this guy,
Simon Blackwall.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.486
He's kind of
a Christopher Hitchens,

02:32.520 --> 02:33.821
Richard Dawkins type.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.923
Scientist,
rationalist, atheist,

02:35.956 --> 02:37.858
makes a killing
on the lecture circuit.

02:37.891 --> 02:39.960
And tonight,
he's about to make

02:39.993 --> 02:42.396
one of the most important
speeches of his career,

02:42.430 --> 02:43.764
refusing God
and religion

02:43.797 --> 02:45.499
and establishing
what he calls

02:45.533 --> 02:47.335
the Church
of Exalted Existence.

02:47.368 --> 02:50.571
"Millions saw the apple
fall from the tree,"

02:50.604 --> 02:52.573
said Bernard Baruch.

02:52.606 --> 02:56.544
"Newton was the only one
who asked why."

02:56.577 --> 02:58.646
Reason.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.482
- Not hocus--
- ( stomach rumbles )

03:01.515 --> 03:02.983
( groans )

03:03.016 --> 03:05.386
Thom: The thing about Simon,
though, is this--

03:05.419 --> 03:08.356
he's got a beautiful house.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.923
He's got a great career.

03:09.957 --> 03:13.927
He's got a BMW
10,000 whatever I.

03:13.961 --> 03:18.832
But he's miserable,
and he doesn't know why.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.269
He's been having
these stomach pains lately,

03:21.302 --> 03:24.672
but the doctors,
they can't find anything.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.674
And then, that night,

03:26.707 --> 03:28.676
Simon's life
changes forever.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.977
( Simon groans )

03:30.010 --> 03:32.913
Because there, inside
the crotch of his underwear...

03:32.946 --> 03:34.548
Jesus.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.016
...is a skid mark.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.551
A shit stain.

03:37.585 --> 03:38.952
Jesus Christ.

03:38.986 --> 03:41.855
That looks exactly,
and I mean exactly,

03:41.889 --> 03:44.425
like the Lord
Jesus Christ himself.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.694
And Simon is freaked out,

03:46.727 --> 03:48.896
because it doesn't
kind of look like Jesus,

03:48.929 --> 03:51.732
like when they kind of
sort of find the Virgin Mary

03:51.765 --> 03:53.367
in a Cinnabon or something.

03:53.401 --> 03:55.703
This is an almost
photographic reproduction

03:55.736 --> 03:57.838
of the son of God
out of shit,

03:57.871 --> 04:01.275
right there in
Simon Blackwall's underpants.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.578
And Simon, see,
he's a scientist.

04:04.612 --> 04:07.815
He's a rationalist.
But he can't explain this.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.583
The likeness is too exact.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.452
The odds are too miniscule.

04:11.485 --> 04:14.455
The chances,
too impossible.

04:14.488 --> 04:19.760
Someone, he decides,
some thing made this happen.

04:26.334 --> 04:28.836
Morning.
You working on Wonderbra?

04:28.869 --> 04:31.605
( typing )
No.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.474
What are you working on?

04:33.507 --> 04:35.643
What does it matter?

04:35.676 --> 04:37.010
Well, Gottfrid and Gustaff

04:37.044 --> 04:38.879
have scheduled
an all-agency meeting

04:38.912 --> 04:40.581
for 11:00, no exceptions.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.882
Pretty sure that means you.

04:41.915 --> 04:43.617
So the Wonderbra
creative review

04:43.651 --> 04:44.785
has been moved to Friday,

04:44.818 --> 04:46.086
so if you were working
on Wonderbra, then--

04:46.119 --> 04:48.656
Lorna, I'm not working
on Wonderbra!

04:49.757 --> 04:52.660
( typing continues )

04:57.398 --> 04:59.299
( sighs )
Shit.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.571
Lee:
Thom is gonna flip out.

05:03.604 --> 05:04.905
- It's gorgeous.
- I know.

05:04.938 --> 05:06.740
It's really gorgeous.

05:06.774 --> 05:10.110
Okay, we've got,
like, seven hours

05:10.143 --> 05:13.914
to turn this room
into a writer's office.

05:13.947 --> 05:16.917
Okay, so are we wallpapering
and painting?

05:16.950 --> 05:18.852
How Martha Stewart
is this project?

05:18.886 --> 05:20.921
No, no. We're gonna
keep this really simple.

05:20.954 --> 05:24.492
We're just gonna shove all
this shit into the basement.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.660
We're gonna make
a quick trip to Ikea.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.596
- Ikea?
- Just pick up a few things,

05:28.629 --> 05:31.031
bring 'em home, put 'em
together before Thom gets back.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.066
Lee, have you ever built
anything from Ikea?

05:33.100 --> 05:34.935
It takes hours.
We'll never do it.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.704
Yes, we will.
It's so easy.

05:36.737 --> 05:37.838
We just need
to get a chair,

05:37.871 --> 05:40.073
a bookcase,
and a writing desk.

05:40.107 --> 05:41.141
Bella: A desk?

05:41.174 --> 05:43.677
Honey, that's, like,
a month and a half.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.713
You know, that's how
they torture prisoners

05:45.746 --> 05:47.080
- at Abu Ghraib.
- Shut up.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.817
I'm serious. They make them
build Ikea furniture.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.552
They work on it
for months,

05:51.585 --> 05:53.621
and then they realize that
they're missing two pieces

05:53.654 --> 05:55.956
and a bag of screws.

05:55.989 --> 05:58.158
You okay?

05:58.191 --> 06:00.761
( exhales )

06:00.794 --> 06:02.896
Lexapro.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.832
That shit really
kicked your ass, huh?

06:04.865 --> 06:06.867
Don't even get me
started on my ass.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.569
Ring of fire.

06:08.602 --> 06:11.705
That's what you get
for trying to be happy.

06:11.739 --> 06:16.410
Okay. Ikea,
here we come.

06:16.444 --> 06:17.277
I'm not kidding.

06:17.310 --> 06:19.079
The prisoners are like,
"Not Ikea again.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.848
Can't you just
waterboard me?"

06:20.881 --> 06:22.683
Thom:
Or maybe I decided to quit

06:22.716 --> 06:24.585
at Gottfrid's agency meeting.

06:24.618 --> 06:27.755
( cheering )

06:33.026 --> 06:35.496
Gottfrid:
Yeah.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.498
Okay, MGT.

06:37.531 --> 06:40.701
So I have two pieces
of good news,

06:40.734 --> 06:42.436
one piece, bad news.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.137
- Which first?
- Crowd: Good!

06:44.171 --> 06:47.875
Okay, so we do good news,
bad news, good news.

06:47.908 --> 06:51.579
Some of you already know
that there are some big changes

06:51.612 --> 06:54.014
coming to MGT, yeah?

06:54.047 --> 06:57.985
Gustaff and I have designed
a new and exciting workspace,

06:58.018 --> 07:01.889
a space that will really
make the industry

07:01.922 --> 07:05.926
stand up and take notice
and say, "Whoa.

07:05.959 --> 07:09.697
That is not the MGT
we used to know."

07:09.730 --> 07:12.566
Yeah? It will take some time,
though, to complete.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.802
So, in the meantime,

07:14.835 --> 07:16.870
we thought we'd start
with a small taste

07:16.904 --> 07:18.572
of what's to come.

07:18.606 --> 07:21.174
Yeah? Because we are
in the idea business, yes?

07:21.208 --> 07:25.178
- Crowd: Yes!
- Groundbreaking ideas.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.715
Yeah?
And business moves at...

07:27.748 --> 07:29.783
Crowd:
The speed of ideas!

07:29.817 --> 07:31.051
You don't have
to like it, but...?

07:31.084 --> 07:32.686
Crowd:
You can't ignore it!

07:32.720 --> 07:33.954
Yeah!

07:33.987 --> 07:35.556
( cheering, applause )

07:39.259 --> 07:40.661
Okay.

07:40.694 --> 07:43.631
( speaks Swedish )

07:43.664 --> 07:46.967
( gasping, cheering )

07:50.971 --> 07:52.773
Gottfrid:
Hold on. Wait.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.908
I just had a great idea
for the Army,

07:54.942 --> 07:57.511
and business is moving
at the speed of ideas.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.947
I have to tell Gustaff.
But wait.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.983
He's upstairs
in the ideation room.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.718
( laughter )

08:04.752 --> 08:08.088
Gustaff! Gustaff!

08:08.121 --> 08:11.525
I have a great idea!
Come quick!

08:19.567 --> 08:21.001
( cheering, applause )

08:27.207 --> 08:29.677
The new MGT.

08:29.710 --> 08:34.848
( crowd chanting )
MGT! MGT! MGT! MGT!

08:34.882 --> 08:36.116
MGT!

08:36.149 --> 08:39.687
Okay, so we have been
through a lot together

08:39.720 --> 08:41.021
over the past few months.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.190
We have lost some friends,
but we gained some new ones.

08:43.223 --> 08:46.994
Lots of new faces
here at MGT.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.963
And I really believe that--
that we are a team.

08:49.997 --> 08:51.732
- Yeah?
- Crowd: Yeah.

08:51.765 --> 08:54.134
More than that--
we are a family.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.136
- Man: Yeah!
- Gottfrid: Yeah?

08:56.169 --> 08:58.271
( crowd chanting )
Family! Family! Family!

08:58.305 --> 09:02.142
And so, I'd like everyone,
at some point today,

09:02.175 --> 09:05.145
to take a turn
down the slide,

09:05.178 --> 09:08.115
and Gustaff will take
a little Polaroid of you,

09:08.148 --> 09:10.017
and you write your name
at the bottom,

09:10.050 --> 09:11.284
we hang it on the wall

09:11.318 --> 09:13.721
so we can all get to know
each other a bit better.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.022
Nice idea, yes?

09:15.055 --> 09:16.824
- ( crowd cheering )
- Okay.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.959
- So fun!
- Totally, right?

09:18.992 --> 09:20.961
( both imitate explosion )

09:20.994 --> 09:24.898
And now, I'm afraid,
for the bad news.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.166
( crowd groans )

09:26.199 --> 09:29.136
After a long
and difficult process,

09:29.169 --> 09:30.337
I'm afraid we heard
this morning

09:30.370 --> 09:33.707
that we did not win
the Coke pitch.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.243
( all groan )

09:36.276 --> 09:38.045
Gottfrid:
We showed them great work.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.348
We showed them
great ideas.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.784
Radical happiness,
which I have to say

09:43.817 --> 09:46.954
is one of the best ideas
we've ever come up with.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.056
- We?
- But, in the end,

09:49.089 --> 09:50.958
they went with
Wieden and Kennedy.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.994
( crowd boos )

09:54.027 --> 09:56.329
And so...

09:56.363 --> 09:59.332
( laughter )

09:59.366 --> 10:00.734
Fuck them.

10:00.768 --> 10:02.770
( crowd cheering )

10:04.838 --> 10:07.374
Gottfrid: And now
for the good news, yeah?

10:07.407 --> 10:13.013
I know many of you know
Gustaff as a man of few words,

10:13.046 --> 10:16.717
but like most geniuses,

10:16.750 --> 10:19.186
the few words he does say
are often quite brilliant.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.121
So, as we were preparing

10:21.154 --> 10:24.692
for the J.P. Morgan pitch
a couple of weeks ago,

10:24.725 --> 10:28.395
Gustaff came to me
and whispered two words--

10:28.428 --> 10:31.031
"radical capitalism."

10:31.064 --> 10:32.966
( laughter )

10:33.000 --> 10:35.102
Gottfrid: I'd like to show you
the video we presented

10:35.135 --> 10:38.071
to the J.P. Morgan pitch
last week.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.406
( clicks )

10:40.473 --> 10:43.410
( music playing )

10:46.379 --> 10:48.716
Announcer:
Money tends to get a bad rap.

10:48.749 --> 10:52.686
They never tire of telling us
what money can't buy,

10:52.720 --> 10:55.155
while warning us
in the same breath

10:55.188 --> 10:57.424
of all the ills
it can cause.

10:57.457 --> 11:02.395
Well, at J.P. Morgan,
we say "bull."

11:02.429 --> 11:05.966
At J.P. Morgan,
we love money.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.035
We love
the way money smells.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.370
We love the way
it sounds.

11:10.403 --> 11:12.072
Let's get something
straight.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.407
Money isn't the root
of all evil.

11:14.441 --> 11:17.745
Evil is the root
of all evil.

11:17.778 --> 11:23.216
Money can't buy happiness?
We say bull.

11:23.250 --> 11:26.153
A Lamborghini
will make you happy.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.857
A mansion with a pool?
Happy.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.125
Caribbean vacation home?

11:32.159 --> 11:34.862
Happy, happy, happy.

11:34.895 --> 11:37.030
Money can buy health.

11:37.064 --> 11:39.199
Money can buy
families.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.802
It's time
to stop apologizing.

11:41.835 --> 11:45.205
It's time
not just for capitalism,

11:45.238 --> 11:47.174
but for radical
capitalism.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.177
The next time you raise
a fist in the air,

11:50.210 --> 11:52.780
make sure
there's some cash in it.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.782
J.P. Morgan.

11:54.815 --> 11:59.319
Not just capitalism.
Radical capitalism.

11:59.352 --> 12:02.455
( cheering, applause )

12:02.489 --> 12:04.825
Gottfrid: J.P. Morgan
called this morning.

12:07.494 --> 12:10.063
- Gustaff won it!
- ( cheering, applause )

12:10.097 --> 12:13.200
That is fucking
bullshit, Thom.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.268
We showed "radical happiness"
weeks ago.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.404
Can they do that?
Can they really do that?

12:17.437 --> 12:20.073
Gottfrid:
So the question is,

12:20.107 --> 12:23.476
"Who's the first one
on the slide, huh?"

12:23.510 --> 12:25.946
Debbie!

12:25.979 --> 12:27.815
( cheering )

12:27.848 --> 12:30.517
( crowd chanting )
Debbie! Debbie! Debbie!

12:32.552 --> 12:36.556
- Thom: Jon.
- ( cheering, applause )

12:36.589 --> 12:38.826
Thom: Jon!

12:38.859 --> 12:41.829
( crowd cheering )

12:41.862 --> 12:42.830
( shutter clicks )

12:45.465 --> 12:48.401
- Jon! Jon!
- Hey, Thom!

12:48.435 --> 12:50.303
Your turn.
Everyone has to do it.

12:50.337 --> 12:53.306
Not fucking now,
Gottfrid. Jon!

12:53.340 --> 12:55.508
He really doesn't
like slides.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.510
( all laugh )

12:57.544 --> 12:59.246
Bella:
This is a lot of shit.

12:59.279 --> 13:00.513
Ditch the lamp.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.382
- Which one?
- The floor one.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.952
- Which is the floor one?
- I don't know.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.253
"Cockenballsen."
Whatever.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.555
Cockenballsen?
I thought it was Felch.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.391
- Is Felch the desk lamp?
- Oh, my God.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.895
- You okay, honey?
- No. ( retches )

13:14.928 --> 13:16.329
Oh. Oh, shit.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.598
That is disgusting.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.168
- She happens to be on Lexapro.
- Bella.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.536
You know, I'm on Lexapro.
I don't vomit.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.438
Well, side effects
may vary, okay?

13:25.472 --> 13:27.274
She shouldn't
come in here if she's sick.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.942
What the hell
are you talking about?

13:28.976 --> 13:30.277
Sick people
are the only ones

13:30.310 --> 13:31.611
that come into
this fucking place.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.146
- Cashier: Charlie.
- You have two carts.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.447
Two carts of plastic shit

13:34.481 --> 13:36.216
you think's gonna
make your life happy.

13:36.249 --> 13:37.517
Who's the sick one here?

13:37.550 --> 13:39.887
Miss, let's get you
to a restroom.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.257
Here.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.860
You know I'm gonna have
to charge you for that bag.

13:46.894 --> 13:49.562
Thom: Now, Blackwall,
you see, he's fucked.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.464
He's seen
some sort of truth,

13:51.498 --> 13:54.301
some sort of meaning,
and there's no turning back.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.304
Ladies and gentlemen,
Simon Blackwall.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.907
( cheering, applause )

14:06.446 --> 14:08.315
Give 'em hell, Simon!

14:08.348 --> 14:11.351
- There is no hell!
- ( laughter )

14:16.223 --> 14:21.328
"Millions saw
the apple fall,"

14:21.361 --> 14:23.663
said Bernard Baruch,

14:23.696 --> 14:27.400
"but Newton was the only one
who asked why."

14:28.969 --> 14:32.672
Uh, but except--
except he didn't ask why,

14:32.705 --> 14:35.208
because Newton
was a scientist

14:35.242 --> 14:39.312
and a coward,
like all scientists.

14:39.346 --> 14:42.015
Because Newton
asked how not why,

14:42.049 --> 14:44.017
because all science
has ever done

14:44.051 --> 14:46.519
and all science ever will do
is answer how,

14:46.553 --> 14:49.990
and how is the least
important question of all.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.225
Thom: In fact,
he's so overwhelmed

14:52.259 --> 14:54.361
by this incredible
shit stain,

14:54.394 --> 14:56.229
that instead of extoling
the virtues

14:56.263 --> 14:57.664
of science
and rationality,

14:57.697 --> 14:59.566
he rages against
what he now calls

14:59.599 --> 15:02.669
the cult of logic,
the religion of science.

15:02.702 --> 15:05.238
At least true religion
has the balls

15:05.272 --> 15:07.040
to ask the bigger question!

15:09.409 --> 15:10.944
And stay out.

15:10.978 --> 15:13.113
Thom:
His career is ruined.

15:13.146 --> 15:16.249
But Simon is elated,

15:16.283 --> 15:17.985
because though
the rest of his world

15:18.018 --> 15:20.687
thinks it's foolish,
he's found something...

15:20.720 --> 15:23.023
of meaning.

15:23.056 --> 15:24.724
- That's as far as I got.
- ( film audio stops )

15:24.757 --> 15:26.526
And that,
now I think of it,

15:26.559 --> 15:28.561
is when I decided to quit.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.031
Yeah, I'm sure
he's pissed off.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.365
What do you
want me to do?

15:32.399 --> 15:34.367
Send him
a fuckin' fruit basket?

15:34.401 --> 15:37.004
Hey. Hang on.

15:38.038 --> 15:41.975
( sighs )
I'm done.

15:42.009 --> 15:43.710
You're-- you're done?

15:43.743 --> 15:45.378
Yeah, I'm done.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.314
Done with what?

15:47.347 --> 15:48.681
With this fucking job.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.550
With this
fucking whorehouse.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.686
I need to call you back.

15:57.357 --> 16:00.293
- You're quitting?
- I'm done, man.

16:00.327 --> 16:01.728
I can't do
this job anymore.

16:01.761 --> 16:05.565
- The job of being a father?
- What?

16:05.598 --> 16:08.435
Of being a husband?
Is that the job you're quitting?

16:08.468 --> 16:11.571
Because providing
for your family is your job.

16:11.604 --> 16:14.741
( laughs )
Wow. Holy fuck.

16:14.774 --> 16:18.078
Jonathan Berg is about
to lecture me on fatherhood.

16:20.347 --> 16:24.051
I write poetry.
Did you know that?

16:24.084 --> 16:25.552
- No, you don't.
- I do.

16:25.585 --> 16:28.055
On weekends.
It's kind of a...

16:28.088 --> 16:31.458
"Philip Larkin meets
Joseph Stalin" kind of a thing.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.560
Good for you, Jon.

16:33.593 --> 16:36.596
So should I quit my job
and stick Dani with my bills?

16:36.629 --> 16:38.665
Is that real love, Thom?

16:38.698 --> 16:41.534
Sticking my beloved with
another 20 years of work

16:41.568 --> 16:43.203
so I can pretend to be
some kind of artist?

16:43.236 --> 16:44.704
Grow the fuck up.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.507
Fatherhood isn't just
about covering the bills, Jon.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.076
It's about telling my son

16:49.109 --> 16:52.079
that he can be happy
doing something meaningful,

16:52.112 --> 16:54.781
that money isn't
the only thing that matters.

16:57.150 --> 17:00.620
36,000 fiction
submissions a year--

17:00.653 --> 17:02.289
that's what
"The New Yorker" gets.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.556
Did you know that?

17:03.590 --> 17:06.826
Thom, what do they run?
One, two stories per issue?

17:06.859 --> 17:10.263
One of 'em is some
pretentious Steve Martin shit.

17:10.297 --> 17:11.431
The other's
some piece of crap

17:11.464 --> 17:12.665
that Woody Allen found

17:12.699 --> 17:14.734
in the bottom
of his desk drawer.

17:14.767 --> 17:16.536
You're a good friend,
Jonathan.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.405
I appreciate your support.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.473
We can beat
these Swedes, Thom.

17:20.507 --> 17:21.641
We can beat 'em.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.843
I don't want
to beat them.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.445
Well, then,
they're gonna beat you.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.680
You know,
I love this idea

17:27.714 --> 17:30.550
that you can defeat something
without becoming just like it.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.119
Look at you.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.520
You're 52 years old
and you can't stop.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.122
You can't stop working,

17:35.155 --> 17:38.558
you can't stop competing,
dominating, winning.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.393
You're an addict.

17:40.427 --> 17:42.395
And you're only pissed off
because I'm trying to go clean.

17:42.429 --> 17:45.798
36,000 submissions
a year, Thom.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.467
Maybe you're
the next Hemingway.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.469
Bet you are.
Bet you're the next Joyce.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.738
Bet you're the next
William goddamn Faulkner.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.407
Only "The New Yorker" never
published any of them either.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.742
You know,
part of me thought

17:55.775 --> 17:59.279
you might actually
be happy for me.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.547
Happy for you?

18:00.580 --> 18:02.315
You have any idea
how much it costs

18:02.349 --> 18:04.851
to raise a child
these days?

18:04.884 --> 18:10.857
Pay for-- for braces,
college, cars.

18:10.890 --> 18:14.727
You wrote that fucking
J.P. Morgan video, didn't you?

18:14.761 --> 18:17.497
Did I win
the J.P. Morgan account?

18:17.530 --> 18:19.766
Did I save another 30 jobs
including yours?

18:19.799 --> 18:21.768
Yes. Did I let Gustaff
take the credit?

18:21.801 --> 18:24.904
Yes, I did.
Forgive me.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.539
So you go.

18:26.573 --> 18:27.807
Go, write--
write your fuckin' novel,

18:27.840 --> 18:29.676
and then shove it
up your ass,

18:29.709 --> 18:31.711
because it's the insurance
from this fuckin' whorehouse

18:31.744 --> 18:35.282
you work at that's gonna pay
to have it removed.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.649
I'm out.

18:39.452 --> 18:43.323
36,000 submissions, Thom!

18:43.356 --> 18:45.625
36,000!

18:50.763 --> 18:53.500
Sometimes
they're wrong, honey.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.268
They get false positives.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.237
I did all three.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.308
( sighs )

19:02.775 --> 19:05.845
( crying )
Oh, my God.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.881
( snorts )

19:08.915 --> 19:10.917
Ugh!

19:12.552 --> 19:14.621
Hey, look,
you know what?

19:14.654 --> 19:16.923
Some people
like me and Barry,

19:16.956 --> 19:20.560
we've been trying
for ages, you know.

19:20.593 --> 19:21.928
You're lucky.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.731
( both laugh )

19:29.969 --> 19:33.940
Oh, we were just getting out
from under it, you know?

19:33.973 --> 19:36.376
I was just getting out
from under it.

19:36.409 --> 19:39.546
I was just starting to feel
like a human again.

19:42.549 --> 19:45.485
Fuck!

19:45.518 --> 19:47.920
And then yay.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.960
And then fuck.

19:57.029 --> 20:00.600
Yay, fuck, yay, fuck.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.335
That's life.

20:08.441 --> 20:11.010
I guess we should start
taking this shit apart.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.280
Yay.

20:14.414 --> 20:15.682
I mean fuck.

20:17.450 --> 20:19.919
Oh, my God!

20:19.952 --> 20:22.221
( crying )

20:43.543 --> 20:45.278
Lee.

20:49.949 --> 20:51.618
Lee?

21:00.627 --> 21:02.529
Hey.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.364
Oh, my God.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.801
Is this for me?

21:13.640 --> 21:14.907
To write in.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.012
Come here.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.618
- Oh, baby.
- Hi.

21:25.652 --> 21:26.886
- I got some news.
- Okay, me, too.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.721
No, no, me first.
Me first.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.723
I'm quitting.
I'm quitting.

21:30.757 --> 21:33.660
It's-- you know,
do I wanna spend

21:33.693 --> 21:35.495
the rest of my days
writing ads?

21:35.528 --> 21:37.029
I had a vision this morning
of my tombstone.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.932
"Here lies Thom Payne.
He wrote that Wonderbra ad."

21:39.966 --> 21:42.635
You know, this is it.
This is what we wanted.

21:42.669 --> 21:44.337
This is why
we moved here, baby.

21:44.371 --> 21:45.204
I know, Thom...

21:45.237 --> 21:47.640
So I can-- you know,
so I can, you know,

21:47.674 --> 21:50.009
write and you can paint.

21:50.042 --> 21:51.711
Oh, my God.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.513
You know, it's--
and-- and--

21:53.546 --> 21:54.647
- Thom.
- It's okay.

21:54.681 --> 21:55.782
Look, I figured it out.

21:55.815 --> 21:59.719
I can earn extra money
from freelancing,

21:59.752 --> 22:01.854
and we can show Jules
that it's possible.

22:01.888 --> 22:05.525
It's possible to--
to find happiness.

22:05.558 --> 22:06.726
So I'm quitting tomorrow,

22:06.759 --> 22:07.960
- and I'll...
- Okay.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.896
I'm gonna spend
my days here,

22:09.929 --> 22:11.964
writing and being happy.

22:24.076 --> 22:26.679
You're pregnant.

22:26.713 --> 22:29.682
I'm so sorry.

22:29.716 --> 22:32.552
( exhales )
Are you sure?

22:32.585 --> 22:33.853
Yeah.

22:35.087 --> 22:37.089
- Oh, baby.
- I know.

22:37.123 --> 22:40.059
- I know. I--
- Fuck. Fuck.

22:40.092 --> 22:43.696
- Your office.
- I love you.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.865
I love you.
I love you.

22:45.898 --> 22:47.534
I love you.
I love you.

22:48.768 --> 22:50.437
I know.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.805
- I'm so sorry.
- Hey. Hey, hey, look at me.

22:52.839 --> 22:54.874
Hey, hey, look. Hey.

22:54.907 --> 22:57.744
Hey.
Another little Julius.

22:57.777 --> 22:59.546
I know.

22:59.579 --> 23:00.613
Or Julia.

23:00.647 --> 23:03.516
- You know?
- Or Julia.

23:05.518 --> 23:08.855
I guess I just fucked myself
out of my writing room.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.994
Yay. Fuck.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.467
- Oh, boy.
- Uh-huh.

23:24.504 --> 23:26.473
( laughs )
Oh.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.180
( exhales )

23:35.214 --> 23:37.784
Thom:
It was nice to quit.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.786
Even if it was temporary.

23:39.819 --> 23:42.889
( cheering )

23:42.922 --> 23:46.225
I did, however,
find an ending to my story.

23:46.258 --> 23:49.161
Simon Blackwall stumbles
through the streets,

23:49.195 --> 23:51.631
ruined, yes,
but ecstatic,

23:51.664 --> 23:53.966
because he has at last
found a reason to live,

23:54.000 --> 23:58.170
a reason for suffering
all these slings and arrows.

24:07.146 --> 24:10.550
- ( pounds )
- Hey, what's the problem here?

24:13.986 --> 24:15.955
- Yes?
- Oh, Father.

24:15.988 --> 24:18.057
Oh, what is it, my son?

24:18.090 --> 24:21.994
Father, I have been
so unhappy and empty,

24:22.028 --> 24:24.030
but-- but the Lord
has called to me

24:24.063 --> 24:25.532
and opened my eyes.

24:25.565 --> 24:26.933
Here, in my underwear.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.200
It's a skid mark,
Father.

24:28.234 --> 24:30.069
A skid mark of our Lord,
Jesus Christ.

24:30.102 --> 24:33.740
And He has shown me
the way to such joy.

24:33.773 --> 24:38.210
But this is-- this is just
an ordinary shit stain.

24:38.244 --> 24:40.947
I-- I-- it got wet.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.682
Looks like
a shit stain to me.

24:42.715 --> 24:44.283
No, no,
this is a sign from God.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.686
This is the reason
for being.

24:46.719 --> 24:51.290
How dare you come in here
and pretend this is holy?

24:51.323 --> 24:53.826
This-- this-- this shit.

24:53.860 --> 24:55.562
- I-- I swear.
- Hey!

24:55.595 --> 24:57.029
You heard the father.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.698
Your shit isn't holy.

24:58.731 --> 25:00.533
Your shit
has no meaning.

25:01.233 --> 25:03.836
Nobody cares
about your shit.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.738
Your shit isn't holy,
you son of a bitch.

25:05.772 --> 25:07.239
Your shit
has no meaning.

25:07.273 --> 25:09.175
- Your shit isn't holy.
- Your shit has no meaning.

25:09.208 --> 25:12.679
- Your shit has no meaning.
- Your shit has no meaning.

25:12.712 --> 25:17.750
- Your shit has no meaning!
- Your shit has no meaning!

25:17.784 --> 25:19.819
Thom: "The New Yorker"
is gonna love it.

25:19.852 --> 25:23.089
Submission number 36,001.

25:23.122 --> 25:26.158
( cheering, applause )

25:32.865 --> 25:34.967
Come on, Thom!

25:36.268 --> 25:41.007
( all chanting )
Thom! Thom! Thom! Thom! Thom!

25:41.040 --> 25:44.043
( chanting continues )

25:45.645 --> 25:47.980
( chanting fades )

25:54.320 --> 25:56.222
Lee:
We're with you, Thom.

25:56.255 --> 25:59.025
You don't have to go down
if you don't want to.

25:59.058 --> 26:02.161
You don't have to do it
for me, buddy.

26:02.194 --> 26:04.330
You don't have to do it
for me.

26:07.834 --> 26:10.703
( chanting resumes )

26:15.842 --> 26:18.077
( cheering, applause )

26:18.110 --> 26:19.746
( camera shutter clicks )

26:22.949 --> 26:24.684
Thom:
You gotta hand it to Stalin.

26:24.717 --> 26:26.185
He didn't fuck around.

26:26.218 --> 26:27.920
When he wanted
to control you,

26:27.954 --> 26:30.790
he threw you in the Gulag
or shot you in the head.

26:30.823 --> 26:33.192
Nowadays, they give you
a 30-year mortgage.

26:33.225 --> 26:36.028
They give you an auto loan,
credit card bills,

26:36.062 --> 26:37.797
and a Graco
convertible crib

26:37.830 --> 26:39.899
with three-position
mattress adjustment

26:39.932 --> 26:42.802
and a one-year
limited warranty.

26:42.835 --> 26:45.672
Yay! Fuck.

26:45.705 --> 26:47.807
Yay!

26:47.840 --> 26:49.809
Fuck.

26:50.677 --> 26:53.680

you know it, clap your hands *

26:53.713 --> 26:56.082

26:56.115 --> 26:57.750
