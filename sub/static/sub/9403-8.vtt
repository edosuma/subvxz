a dissociative fugue disorder.</i>

00:04.764 --> 00:06.139

05:22.331 --> 05:24.834
That's why Chris Keller
didn't enlist in the air force.

05:24.835 --> 05:26.903
Yeah, that's one
of several reasons,

05:26.904 --> 05:29.172

06:12.352 --> 06:15.153
He was just so weird
last night...

06:15.154 --> 06:17.719
Lying about his dad
and his bruises.

06:17.720 --> 06:20.659
Whoa, dude. Careful of jumping
to conclusions on something like that.

06:20.660 --> 06:21.973

06:21.974 --> 06:23.808
Besides,
he's probably just lying

06:23.809 --> 06:25.602

to seem cool.

06:25.603 --> 06:28.021
Yeah.

06:32.937 --> 06:35.372
Okay. So, what do you
want to do now?

another movie?

06:38.197 --> 06:41.284

06:44.413 --> 06:45.650

06:45.651 --> 06:47.919
I just think that you should
try to think positive

06:47.920 --> 06:49.751
and not let your mind wander
to those worst places.

06:49.752 --> 06:51.389
I'm doing
the best that I can,

06:51.390 --> 06:54.025

he's okay and he's coming home.

had an accident.

Yeah. More or less.

15:26.810 --> 15:29.896
I can be very convincing.

15:29.897 --> 15:32.884
Well, we all appreciate
what you said

15:32.885 --> 15:34.483
to that sadistic bastard.

15:34.484 --> 15:37.888
I hated that son of a bitch
when I was in here.

15:37.889 --> 15:40.792
I know you did, too,
so you're welcome.

15:40.793 --> 15:44.493
I assume
this little gift of yours

15:44.494 --> 15:47.765
comes with conditions,
huh?

15:47.766 --> 15:50.750
It's about my son.

16:02.279 --> 16:04.047
You got a bottle of clarity
back there?

16:04.048 --> 16:05.681
I got something
I need to work out.

16:05.682 --> 16:07.050
Uh, I wish I could.

16:07.051 --> 16:10.353
I got called to active duty,
so I'm no longer bar manager.

16:10.354 --> 16:12.855
I thought you was
just a bartender.

16:12.856 --> 16:14.856
Okay.

16:14.857 --> 16:17.493
Since it is you
and you clearly need an ear,

16:17.494 --> 16:19.629
guess I could serve one last drink

16:19.630 --> 16:21.030
and listen to
one last problem.

16:21.031 --> 16:24.533
Mm. Good man, chase.
You're a good man.

16:24.534 --> 16:25.969
So, what's up?

16:25.970 --> 16:28.746
Okay. You know me and Lauren
used to date, right?

16:28.747 --> 16:32.667

we'll still, you know...

16:32.668 --> 16:34.210
What?

16:34.211 --> 16:36.420
You know.

16:36.421 --> 16:38.316
Hang out?
Tandem bike rides?

16:38.317 --> 16:40.007
You had a book club?
What?

16:40.008 --> 16:41.634
Dude, really?

16:41.635 --> 16:44.720
I'm screwing with you.
So, what's your problem?

16:44.721 --> 16:46.024
Well, I've been gone,

16:46.025 --> 16:48.307
and we haven't, you know,
in a while.

16:48.308 --> 16:51.602
I saw her today,
and she was pregnant.

16:51.603 --> 16:54.021
I'm talking about
big-as-a-house pregnant.

16:54.022 --> 16:57.869
Man, I guess that explains why
she was acting a little weird

16:57.870 --> 16:59.694
the last few months
when I called or texted.

17:01.570 --> 17:02.780
So, what should I do?

17:02.781 --> 17:04.643
I'm gonna go really far out
on a limb here

17:04.644 --> 17:06.242
and say you should
go talk to her.

17:06.242 --> 17:09.214
Damn, you good, dawg.

17:09.215 --> 17:12.080
I see why they let you manage
this place.

17:13.386 --> 17:16.127
So, what if it <i>is</i> yours?

17:16.127 --> 17:17.723
Then I'm gonna man up.

17:17.724 --> 17:20.548
Hell, I'm not about to be
a bad father.

17:21.923 --> 17:24.135
There's already too many
of those out there as it is.

17:24.136 --> 17:26.929
You're right about that.

17:26.930 --> 17:28.535
I tell you one thing,
though.

17:28.536 --> 17:30.236
I did not expect to
wake up today

17:30.237 --> 17:31.976
and find out
that I'm a father.

17:41.214 --> 17:42.737

17:42.738 --> 17:43.849
Hey, I'm just recommending

17:43.850 --> 17:45.417
a simple work-then-reward
method.

17:45.418 --> 17:46.824
It might help us
get somewhere.

17:46.825 --> 17:49.889
Hey, I use it all the time
on myself.

17:51.692 --> 17:53.247
Okay.

17:54.727 --> 17:56.333
What do you
want to talk about?

17:56.334 --> 17:57.793
Let's talk about Sara.

17:59.252 --> 18:00.629
What happened
the day that she died?

18:02.369 --> 18:03.966
We've already
talked about this.

18:03.967 --> 18:05.718
Actually, no, we haven't.

18:05.719 --> 18:09.722
Not without you leaving
or, unchanging the subject.

18:09.723 --> 18:11.678
Now, you've been willing to
talk about anything

18:11.679 --> 18:12.879
up until that day,

18:12.880 --> 18:14.351
anything after that day,
but not the day itself.

18:14.352 --> 18:17.480
Come on, Clay.
We have to at least try.

18:17.481 --> 18:20.453
If you truly
want to get better,

18:20.454 --> 18:23.056
you have got to let go
of your reservations

18:23.057 --> 18:24.357
and open yourself up...

18:24.358 --> 18:26.363
No matter the risk.

18:31.993 --> 18:33.829
Hey, everybody.

18:33.830 --> 18:35.414
Hi, Brooke. Hi, Brooke.
Hi, Brooke. Hi, Brooke.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.291
Hi, Brooke.
Hi, Brooke.

18:39.960 --> 18:42.755
What is that creep
doing here?

18:42.756 --> 18:45.144
I don't know he.

18:45.145 --> 18:47.426
That's his third slice
of cherry pie.

18:47.427 --> 18:49.637
He says we have the best
in Tree Hill.

18:49.638 --> 18:51.472
Hey, Brooke,
did you bring...

18:55.308 --> 18:56.644
All right. Let's go.
Get up.

18:56.645 --> 18:57.853
I'm still eating.

18:58.979 --> 19:00.648
Hey, I wasn't doing
anything wrong.

19:00.649 --> 19:03.150
There's no law
against eating.

19:05.860 --> 19:08.447
Go, before I beat the hell
out of of you.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.616
Just wanted
some cherry pie.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.007
I'm telling you right now

19:12.008 --> 19:14.409
that prison will be
the least of your worries

19:14.410 --> 19:16.330
if you come near
my family again.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.750
I wasn't doing anything!

19:23.380 --> 19:25.506
And the police
don't know anything?

19:25.507 --> 19:27.800
Not that they've told me.

19:27.801 --> 19:29.824
Thank you.

19:29.825 --> 19:32.093
Deb, I can't shake
the feeling

19:32.094 --> 19:34.640
that Dan is involved
in this somehow.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.463
Oh, Haley.

19:36.464 --> 19:39.066
As screwed up as he is,
I can't believe for a second

19:39.067 --> 19:41.063
that Dan had anything
to do with this.

19:41.064 --> 19:45.818
Any good Dan has ever done
has been for Nathan.

19:45.819 --> 19:47.841
Well, if it wasn't him
directly,

19:47.842 --> 19:50.910
it could easily have been
someone that he's pissed off

19:50.911 --> 19:52.241
somewhere down the line.

19:52.242 --> 19:53.868
I don't know.

19:53.869 --> 19:55.682
I have
so many possibilities

19:55.683 --> 19:58.652
that are just swirling around
in my head every day,

19:58.653 --> 20:01.625
and each one is worse
than the last.

20:03.251 --> 20:05.671
And I don't
have anything else to go on.

20:12.668 --> 20:16.056
Last place we saw him,
I saw that...

20:17.474 --> 20:19.810
painted on the wall
behind him.

20:19.811 --> 20:24.181
I don't know anything
about the kidnapping.

20:24.182 --> 20:27.359
Give me a name...
Someone who might know about it.

20:27.360 --> 20:30.154
Does the name Constantin
mean anything to you?

20:30.155 --> 20:31.864
No.

20:31.865 --> 20:35.201
What about Zoran?
Or Dmitri?

20:35.202 --> 20:37.578
Dmitri.

20:37.579 --> 20:39.963
Yeah.

20:39.964 --> 20:43.232
Yeah, Dmitri,
I got it, okay?

20:46.170 --> 20:49.506
You know him?

20:49.507 --> 20:51.258
Maybe.

20:51.259 --> 20:54.011
Well, I hope you don't.

20:54.012 --> 20:56.555
These guys are assassins.
They're ruthless.

20:56.556 --> 20:59.141
If they do, in fact,
have your boy,

20:59.142 --> 21:04.420
well, I'm afraid
it's probably too late.

21:10.527 --> 21:12.528
We didn't talk.

21:13.664 --> 21:16.700
Scott.

21:16.701 --> 21:19.620
That, uh,
TV show of yours...

21:19.621 --> 21:21.873
You think we'll ever find
redemption

21:21.874 --> 21:23.290
for the things we've done?

21:24.976 --> 21:27.086
I wouldn't count on it.

21:27.087 --> 21:29.713

21:50.969 --> 21:54.071
Oh, uh, hi.
What are you doing here?

21:54.072 --> 21:55.906
Oh, I heard about Nathan.

21:55.907 --> 21:57.776
Yeah. It's awful.

21:57.777 --> 21:59.178
Yeah, I, uh,
just cam town

21:59.179 --> 22:00.946
to see if there was something
I could do.

22:00.947 --> 22:03.182
I stopped by their house first,
but nobody was there.

22:03.183 --> 22:04.684
Unfortunately,
I don't think

22:04.685 --> 22:06.619
that there's anything
any of us can do,

22:06.620 --> 22:08.055
but it was really nice
of you

22:08.056 --> 22:09.878
to drive all this way
to support Haley.

22:09.879 --> 22:13.294
Nah. I still consider Haley
and Nathan family.

22:13.295 --> 22:16.051
And you, too,
as weird as that may sound.

22:16.052 --> 22:18.565
It doesn't sound weird.

22:18.566 --> 22:19.930
How've you been?

22:19.931 --> 22:22.235
Uh, good.

22:22.236 --> 22:25.437
Real good, actually.
I'm seeing someone.

22:25.438 --> 22:28.147
And don't worry.
It's not another one of your sisters.

22:29.476 --> 22:31.443

outside of the James family,

22:31.444 --> 22:32.711

24:36.609 --> 24:38.485
I'll look after him.
I promise.

24:42.780 --> 24:45.284
Just one. I got to go say goodbye
to Chuck before I take off.

24:54.154 --> 24:55.988
Hi.
Hi.

24:55.989 --> 24:57.823
I brought you lunch.

24:57.824 --> 24:59.092
Thanks.

24:59.093 --> 25:02.362
I've been calling,
but it was going to voicemail.

25:02.363 --> 25:05.032
Oh, sorry.
Um, Deb actually came over,

25:05.033 --> 25:08.849
and then I've just been
out of it for a while.

25:10.338 --> 25:14.008
The police... they pulled a body
out of the river

25:14.009 --> 25:16.778
and thought
it might be Nathan.

25:16.779 --> 25:19.776
I had to go down
and identify it.

25:19.777 --> 25:21.111
It wasn't.

25:21.112 --> 25:23.197
Oh, my God, Haley.

25:23.198 --> 25:25.920
That was the literally
the hardest thing

25:25.921 --> 25:27.326
I've ever had to do.

25:27.327 --> 25:30.458
If it had been Nathan when they
pulled back that sheet, I...

25:30.459 --> 25:32.623
Ink I would have died
right there.

25:32.624 --> 25:34.228
Come here.

25:34.229 --> 25:35.834
I'm so sorry.

25:37.627 --> 25:39.801
I, um...

25:39.802 --> 25:41.603
I know it's not much,

25:41.604 --> 25:44.839
but Julian's been working
with Dan,

25:44.840 --> 25:46.803
following some lead.

25:46.804 --> 25:48.680
What... what lead?

25:48.681 --> 25:50.724
I don't know.
Apparently, Dan won't say much.

25:50.725 --> 25:54.144
What could Dan know
that the police don't?

26:09.242 --> 26:11.232
Deb...

26:11.233 --> 26:12.788
What are you doing here?

26:12.789 --> 26:15.082
I came to see what
you were doing to find our son.

26:15.083 --> 26:17.501
Everything I can.

26:21.689 --> 26:22.714
How's Haley doing?

26:22.715 --> 26:24.679
Better than
anyone could imagine

26:24.680 --> 26:27.015
in her situation.

26:27.016 --> 26:29.179
She's upset with you,
though.

26:30.847 --> 26:32.307
I can't say I blame her.

26:34.016 --> 26:37.062
I can't lose him, Dan.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.772
I know.

26:38.773 --> 26:40.232
He's all I have.

26:40.233 --> 26:42.359
I'll get him back.

26:43.776 --> 26:46.280
I'll make everything right
again.

26:51.627 --> 26:54.239
Knows anything
about Nathan?

26:54.240 --> 26:55.373
I heard him say "Dmitri."

26:55.374 --> 26:57.109
How do you know
it's the same guy?

26:57.110 --> 26:58.176
I don't.

26:58.177 --> 26:59.878
But we're in Tree Hill,
Nathan's missing,

26:59.879 --> 27:01.781
and how many Dmitris
do you know?

27:01.782 --> 27:04.817
So, the man who went to prison
for attacking Brooke

27:04.818 --> 27:05.919
was just paroled.

27:05.920 --> 27:07.175
He came to the café today.

27:07.176 --> 27:09.344
I threw him out
and threatened to kick his ass.

27:09.345 --> 27:10.721
So?

27:10.722 --> 27:12.425
So, he said
he wasn't doing anything.

27:12.426 --> 27:13.860
Maybe he wasn't.
I don't know.

27:13.861 --> 27:16.129
Am I just supposed to give him
the benefit of the doubt

27:16.130 --> 27:17.936
now that he's served his time
or something?

27:17.937 --> 27:19.766
The guy's an ex-con.

27:19.767 --> 27:23.108
I wouldn't trust him
for a second.

27:23.109 --> 27:24.970
Yeah.

27:24.971 --> 27:27.487
He can have his second chance
somewhere else.

27:33.834 --> 27:34.980
Hey, Lauren.

27:34.981 --> 27:36.955
Thank you so much
for meeting me.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.585
Antwon,
is everything okay?

27:38.586 --> 27:40.459
You sounded so urgent
on the phone.

27:40.460 --> 27:41.855
Look,
I just want you to know

27:41.856 --> 27:43.457
that I've been thinking
a whole lot

27:43.458 --> 27:45.092
about you
and about your situation.

27:45.093 --> 27:46.590
Well, <i>our</i> situation.

27:46.591 --> 27:49.797
And I just want to
let you know that...

27:49.798 --> 27:52.304
I want to do the right thing
for you and the baby.

27:52.305 --> 27:54.514
I mean,
I want to be there 100%

27:54.515 --> 27:55.803
I'm talking lamaze,

27:55.804 --> 27:58.338
midnight runs for ice cream,
all that.

27:58.339 --> 27:59.739
And I'm an excellent
baby-proofer,

27:59.740 --> 28:01.271
so you don't have to
worry about that.

28:01.272 --> 28:03.009
That is so sweet.

28:03.010 --> 28:07.413
It's just, um, somebody else
already has that covered.

28:07.414 --> 28:08.862
The father.

28:10.488 --> 28:12.699
Antwon, it's not yours.

28:14.700 --> 28:15.754
Her you go, babe.

28:15.755 --> 28:17.746
Oh, thank you.

28:17.747 --> 28:19.748
Hey.

28:19.749 --> 28:21.166
Skills, right?

28:21.167 --> 28:22.709
Uh, yeah, hey.

28:22.710 --> 28:24.544
Yeah. Hey.

28:24.545 --> 28:27.733
I just want to offer you guys
my baby-proofing expertise.

28:27.734 --> 28:29.925
You never can be
too careful, right?

28:29.926 --> 28:31.635
O, and, um...

28:33.219 --> 28:35.681
I'll even get you
half off.

28:35.682 --> 28:38.266
"Antwon Taylor.
Sports coordinator.

28:38.267 --> 28:39.768
I've got the "skills."

28:39.769 --> 28:41.228
Oh, you got flip that over.

28:42.148 --> 28:44.189
"Antwon Taylor.
Baby-proofer.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.607
I've got the "skills".

28:46.691 --> 28:47.776
Thank you.

28:47.777 --> 28:49.403
David.

28:49.404 --> 28:50.821
Hi, Lauren.

28:50.822 --> 28:53.740
Hey.

28:53.741 --> 28:56.096
Oh! Oh, pregnant's
the girl you're see...

28:56.097 --> 28:58.412
Uh, Lauren's the girl
you're seeing?

28:58.413 --> 29:01.540
Yeah.
You guys know each other?

29:05.774 --> 29:08.004
I remember
the odd look she gave me.

29:08.005 --> 29:09.673
She was in the kitchen.

29:09.674 --> 29:11.613
"Angel flying
too close to the ground"

29:11.614 --> 29:14.550
was playing
on the record player.

29:14.551 --> 29:18.118
She liked the scratches and pops
of the vinyl albums.

29:20.855 --> 29:25.727
And then her eyes rolled back
into her head,

29:25.728 --> 29:29.693
and I watched hedy
just quit.

29:31.733 --> 29:33.739
Se just stopped.

29:35.031 --> 29:36.241
So I ran to her.

29:36.657 --> 29:38.007
Sara! Hey!

29:38.008 --> 29:39.742
And I was thinking
that no matter how hard

29:39.743 --> 29:41.444
I pressed my legs
against the ground,

29:41.445 --> 29:44.347
it wasn't fast enough.

29:44.348 --> 29:46.376
It took me an eternity
to get to her.

29:52.556 --> 29:54.758
And as I was holding her,

29:54.759 --> 29:58.722
I remember thinking,
"this must be a dream."

29:58.723 --> 30:00.849
You know, as if my brain
was telling me

30:00.850 --> 30:04.900
that this couldn't be
reality.

30:04.901 --> 30:07.439
25-year-old women
don't just drop dead.

30:08.604 --> 30:10.650
I waited for her
to wake up.

30:10.651 --> 30:13.475
I was numb.
I couldn't speak or move.

30:15.077 --> 30:20.282
I just stood over her while
they put her on a stretcher...

30:20.826 --> 30:23.620
And pulled the sheet
over her face.

30:23.621 --> 30:27.425
I was thinking,
"this can't be real.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.795
This can't be real."

30:29.796 --> 30:32.130
What happened next, Clay?

30:33.298 --> 30:35.425
I was thinking,
"I can't go on without her.

30:35.966 --> 30:38.762
I just...
I can't possibly."

30:40.888 --> 30:42.041
What do you see, Clay?

30:42.042 --> 30:43.475
I can't talk about this.

30:43.476 --> 30:44.768
Can't or don't want to?

30:44.769 --> 30:46.410
Either.

30:52.191 --> 30:54.319
Wait.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.321
So, David is with Lauren.

30:56.322 --> 30:58.031
Mm-hmm.

30:58.032 --> 30:59.324
<i>Our</i> Lauren.
Yeah.

30:59.325 --> 31:00.951
And the... is his?

31:00.952 --> 31:02.285
Yep.

31:02.286 --> 31:06.206
I mean, I'm happy for them both,
but it's kind of weird.

31:06.207 --> 31:07.791
I bet.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.035
You know, with David,

31:11.036 --> 31:12.754
I could never see us
having kids.

31:12.755 --> 31:14.381
You know? I loved
how spontaneous

31:14.382 --> 31:16.174
our life was early on.

31:16.175 --> 31:18.969
And what about now?
With lay?

31:18.970 --> 31:21.046
With Clay,
it's different.

31:21.047 --> 31:24.224
You know, I'm less concerned
about our future.

31:24.225 --> 31:26.393
Whatever happens,
happens.

31:26.394 --> 31:28.603
It'll be a dream come true,
whatever it is.

31:31.564 --> 31:34.401
You need to leave <i>now,</i>
before I call the police.

31:35.359 --> 31:37.362
I forgot my phone.
That's all.

31:38.404 --> 31:41.283
How convenient.
Now go.

31:45.704 --> 31:47.581
You know,
I haven't done anything.

31:47.582 --> 31:49.541
Haven't done anything?

31:49.542 --> 31:52.511
I served my time.

31:52.512 --> 31:55.338
I have just as much right to be
around Tree Hill as anybody.

31:55.339 --> 31:58.351
And I have the right
to refuse service to anybody,

31:58.352 --> 31:59.752
and I'm not serving you.

31:59.753 --> 32:00.927
Now go.

32:15.403 --> 32:17.360
There's
that son of a bitch.

32:17.361 --> 32:19.154
So, what's the plan?

32:19.155 --> 32:20.655
I'm gonna have a conversation
with him.

32:20.656 --> 32:23.491
Oh, like a <i>conversation</i>
conversation?

32:23.492 --> 32:24.993
I'm gonna whatever kind it takes
to get answers.

32:24.994 --> 32:27.704
All right. Hold on.
You can't just walk up to him.

32:27.705 --> 32:28.788
Why not?

32:28.789 --> 32:31.374
Because he probably has a gun,
for one.

32:31.375 --> 32:33.376
And those guys, for two.

32:33.377 --> 32:35.955
What do you think would happen
if they made one phone call

32:35.956 --> 32:37.857
saying that Dan Scott
is snooping around,

32:37.858 --> 32:39.299
looking for his son?

32:40.726 --> 32:42.802
All I'm saying is
now that we know where he is,

32:42.803 --> 32:45.062
we should come up with
some sort of plan.

32:51.852 --> 32:55.205
So, you're telling me
that you're actually no closer

32:55.206 --> 32:57.525
to finding my husband now
than you were a week ago?

32:57.526 --> 32:58.709
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I can point you

32:58.710 --> 33:00.010
to the detectives
in charge of the case,

33:00.011 --> 33:02.238
- but they'll tell you the same thing.
- The detectives?!

33:02.239 --> 33:05.948
You mean those guys back there
who are watching the game

33:05.949 --> 33:07.449
and laughing
and drinking coffee?!

33:07.450 --> 33:10.455
Nobody is doing anything to find
my husband, and I'm tired of it!

33:10.456 --> 33:11.975
Hey, hey. Look, look. I know that you're
upset, but you do need to calm down.

33:11.976 --> 33:14.042
It has been a week! This is absolutely
absurd! Do you have any idea...

33:14.043 --> 33:15.168
We are doing everything
that we can!

33:15.169 --> 33:18.461
It's not enough! No!
If you don't calm down,

33:18.462 --> 33:19.603
we'll have to remove you
from the bulding.

33:19.604 --> 33:20.882
I went to the morgue
this afternoon!

33:20.883 --> 33:23.343
Is there anyone
we can call?

33:32.677 --> 33:34.946
Haley...

33:34.947 --> 33:37.515
Nobody is making this
a priority.

33:37.516 --> 33:40.652
It's like Nathan's missing,
and it's yesterday's news.

33:40.653 --> 33:42.779
Maybe you should talk
to Dan.

33:42.780 --> 33:44.489
I have trusted Dan before,

33:44.490 --> 33:47.525
and he always makes me feel
like an idiot for it.

33:47.526 --> 33:51.529
I know we both have
many, many reasons to hate him,

33:51.530 --> 33:54.207
but Dan may be
our only hope.

33:55.733 --> 33:58.670
God.

34:05.109 --> 34:07.212
Tell me where
you've been running your mouth!

34:07.213 --> 34:08.612
- No!
- Boy, answer me!

34:08.614 --> 34:09.746
No!
Tell me what you said!

34:09.748 --> 34:11.114
Ow!

34:11.116 --> 34:12.684
Answer me right now! Answer me!

34:14.353 --> 34:15.887
Wade, stop! Please!

34:15.888 --> 34:17.188
What'd you say, boy?!
Huh?!

34:17.188 --> 34:18.648
You been running
your mouth?!

34:18.649 --> 34:20.567
No! No!

34:20.568 --> 34:22.402
You been running

34:22.402 --> 34:25.447
You're hurting him!
Let him go! Let him go!

34:26.966 --> 34:28.324
You stay out here.
Hear me?

34:33.038 --> 34:35.106
I thought
I told you stay... ow!

35:25.125 --> 35:26.827
You didn't call,
so I'm guessing

35:26.828 --> 35:28.802
that son of a bitch
didn't show up again?

35:28.803 --> 35:31.631
He did, actually,
but it was only for a second,

35:31.632 --> 35:35.141
and I handled it pretty
effortlessly, if I must say.

35:35.142 --> 35:36.837
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

35:36.838 --> 35:38.311
You inspired me today.

35:38.312 --> 35:42.565
It was pretty sexy, actually,
you getting all protective.

35:42.566 --> 35:44.692
- You liked that, did you?
- Mm-hmm.

35:44.693 --> 35:46.646
You were right.

35:46.647 --> 35:48.613
I think he was
just trying to scare me.

35:48.614 --> 35:51.616
You need to call me
if you ever see him again.

35:51.617 --> 35:55.022
Okay.

35:55.023 --> 35:57.205
Any news on Nathan?

35:57.206 --> 35:59.749
No, not quite, but I think
we're getting closer.

35:59.750 --> 36:02.829
I can't believe
this is happening.

36:02.830 --> 36:04.838
It doesn't even seem real.

36:04.839 --> 36:07.757
Yeah, I know.

36:07.758 --> 36:10.169
I feel so bad for Haley.

36:10.170 --> 36:12.345
I can't imagine.

36:15.139 --> 36:17.475

How'd you do this?
You're screwing with my head.

38:31.148 --> 38:33.861

I haven't done anything.

I believe your mind

38:35.352 --> 38:36.653
hs been trying to
tell you something

38:36.654 --> 38:37.657
for quite some time now.

38:37.658 --> 38:39.784
So, you've known about this
the whole time?

38:39.785 --> 38:43.861

unaware of my own child?

Sara's parents. Me.

Clay, I told you every day
after Sara died.

38:58.302 --> 39:01.145
I told you,
but you blocked it out.

39:01.146 --> 39:02.598
You weren't ready.

39:02.599 --> 39:05.935
Well, I'm not ready now,
either.

39:07.603 --> 39:11.122
He said that you told him
he's gonna be leaving soon.

39:11.123 --> 39:12.358
Why?

39:12.359 --> 39:17.127
