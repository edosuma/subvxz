00:02.302 --> 00:03.135
- Previously on <i>awkward...</i>

00:03.137 --> 00:05.871
- Loser girl becomes
a loser burnout.

00:05.873 --> 00:07.873
You are such a cliche.

00:07.875 --> 00:09.508
- Your friends are supposed
to stay on your side.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.244
- You're starting
to fixate.

00:12.246 --> 00:14.546
- My reality felt
like solitary confinement.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.915
Let's just get outta here.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.519
- Collin and I had been seeing
each other for weeks,

00:20.521 --> 00:23.389
But we hadn't felt
the need to d.T.R.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.123
We were beyond it.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.592
Because when it came to him,
I was all-in.

00:26.594 --> 00:29.628
Not to mention
d.T.R.'ing was for suckers.

00:29.630 --> 00:32.898
- Dude, your hair's smoking.

00:32.900 --> 00:35.367
- Holy [bleep],
you're on fire.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.635
[both chuckle]

00:36.637 --> 00:37.903
- [gasps]

00:37.905 --> 00:38.470
What the hell?

00:38.472 --> 00:41.040
I loathed hanging out
in the sanctuary.

00:41.042 --> 00:42.041
But it was the only place

00:42.043 --> 00:45.010
Collin and I could be together
hater-free.

00:45.012 --> 00:47.813
♪

00:47.815 --> 00:50.549
And Monday mornings definitely
brought out the dregs.

00:50.551 --> 00:51.950
It was like an a.A. Meeting.

00:51.952 --> 00:53.919
All the addicts
needed their fix

00:53.921 --> 00:55.087
To make it through
the week.

00:55.089 --> 00:57.156
Thank god
I wasn't one of them.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.824
- I gotta go.

00:58.826 --> 00:59.958
- Wait, no, no, no.

00:59.960 --> 01:00.926
Please, just one more.

01:00.928 --> 01:04.696
- That's how it started
for me too.

01:04.697 --> 01:07.399
- I can walk away
anytime I want.

01:18.945 --> 01:21.246
[typing]

01:25.151 --> 01:28.220
- Way to make an effort,
hamiltrick.

01:28.222 --> 01:29.455
Nice bra.

01:29.457 --> 01:33.592
- Okay, it is
an hour-long class.

01:33.594 --> 01:37.096
Romeo will still be here
when it's all over.

01:37.098 --> 01:38.597
Well, it's that time
of year again

01:38.599 --> 01:42.234
When we put out a new edition
of <i>experior.</i>

01:42.236 --> 01:44.103
Does anybody know
what experior means?

01:44.105 --> 01:45.838
- Experior is a superhero

01:45.840 --> 01:48.140
Who possess the power
of telekinesis

01:48.142 --> 01:52.077
And extra-dimensional
time travel.

01:52.079 --> 01:54.046
- It's latin for
"let it be printed,"

01:54.048 --> 01:56.715
And it's also the name
of our literary magazine.

01:56.717 --> 01:58.684
Now you will all
be submitting an essay

01:58.686 --> 01:59.518
For this year's issue,

01:59.520 --> 02:02.087
Which, judging by the level
of talent in this room,

02:02.089 --> 02:03.322
Should look more like
a flyer.

02:03.324 --> 02:07.192
This year's topic:
Heroes and villains.

02:07.194 --> 02:10.429
- Hey.
- Oh, I'll be right back.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.297
Yeah?
- I need your help.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.999
And quite frankly,
you need mine.

02:14.001 --> 02:16.301
I overheard principal cox
talking about

02:16.303 --> 02:18.670
Another round-ee-round
of pink slips.

02:18.672 --> 02:19.872
- That's just talk.

02:19.874 --> 02:20.539
- Oh, yeah?

02:20.541 --> 02:22.274
Look what I found
on my desk this morning.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.142
- That's a phone message.

02:23.144 --> 02:26.011
- Yeah, but it could have just
as easily been a pink slip.

02:26.013 --> 02:26.812
- Who are you?

02:26.814 --> 02:29.014
- Valerie marks,
guidance counselor.

02:29.016 --> 02:30.916
And more recently,
choir leader,

02:30.918 --> 02:32.951
Cheer coach,
drill team mentor.

02:32.953 --> 02:34.853
- Oh, a woman
of many trades.

02:34.855 --> 02:36.488
- Oh, no, only one.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.956
I hate doing
all that other crap.

02:37.958 --> 02:40.259
I'm just trying to make
myself indispensable.

02:40.261 --> 02:40.993
- Why are you here?

02:40.995 --> 02:43.395
- There's a district-wide
video competition,

02:43.397 --> 02:45.130
The winner of which gets...

02:45.132 --> 02:46.165
[drum roll]

02:46.167 --> 02:47.199
Drum roll.

02:47.201 --> 02:49.201
A nurse for a month.

02:49.203 --> 02:49.902
- Our nurse was cut?

02:49.904 --> 02:52.604
- Let's just say she went
gently into that good night.

02:52.606 --> 02:53.739
E.E. Cummings.
- Dylan thomas.

02:53.741 --> 02:54.973
- Who cares what
the nurse's name was?

02:54.975 --> 02:57.009
If I win this thing,
it'll increase my profile

02:57.011 --> 02:59.178
And make me
even more indispensable--

02:59.180 --> 03:01.780
And you, if I can borrow
your students.

03:01.782 --> 03:05.083
- Will this project interfere
with my teaching schedule?

03:05.085 --> 03:07.753
- Just for a week.
- Perfect.

03:07.755 --> 03:08.687
- Drama.

03:08.689 --> 03:11.089
Intrigue.
Suicide.

03:11.091 --> 03:13.425
Drugs.
Depression.

03:13.427 --> 03:16.128
Friendship.
Love.

03:16.130 --> 03:17.896
Alcoholism.

03:17.898 --> 03:20.432
Freeze frames.

03:20.434 --> 03:23.602
These delightful
and somewhat scary words

03:23.604 --> 03:27.439
Describe my favorite
tv genre,

03:27.441 --> 03:29.908
The after...

03:29.910 --> 03:31.276
School...

03:31.278 --> 03:32.244
Special.

03:32.246 --> 03:34.179
A.S.S. For short.

03:34.181 --> 03:36.548
I was addicted to them.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.950
- Uh, you might want
to explain that,

03:37.952 --> 03:39.518
Unless you brought
a time machine.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.018
- I did not.

03:40.020 --> 03:44.823
After school specials were
made-for-tv movies for pubes,

03:44.825 --> 03:46.158
Pubescents,
back in the day,

03:46.160 --> 03:48.260
Which dealt with
controversial subjects

03:48.262 --> 03:51.863
And socially relevant issues.

03:51.865 --> 03:52.764
Lifetime movies for teens.

03:52.766 --> 03:57.102
And I need a crackerjack team
of writers and filmmakers

03:57.104 --> 03:58.103
Who can make it happen.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.972
We'll meet
after school this week.

03:59.974 --> 04:02.708
Feel free to ask your friends
to participate.

04:02.710 --> 04:05.377
But only the attractive ones.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.980
We're talking hd-friendly.

04:07.982 --> 04:08.780
Uh-uh.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.717
- Ugh, the a.S.S. Is gonna
be a train wreck.

04:11.719 --> 04:14.019
What should we do in it?
- Nothing.

04:14.021 --> 04:14.853
Now that I'm grounded,

04:14.855 --> 04:16.788
After school is the only time
we get to spend together.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.690
- Yeah, but I don't think
we can get out of it.

04:19.692 --> 04:23.161
- Oh, yes, we can.

04:23.163 --> 04:26.064
- Have you been crying?
Your eyes look bloodshot.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.800
- I guess I just
got a little emotional

04:28.802 --> 04:30.335
When I found out
about my mom.

04:30.337 --> 04:32.037
- Did something happen
to l-dog?

04:32.039 --> 04:32.938
- She sprained her back.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.307
- Oh, no.
Oh, I gotta call her.

04:35.309 --> 04:36.141
- No, don't do that.

04:36.143 --> 04:38.176
She doesn't want
anyone to know.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.344
She's embarrassed.

04:39.346 --> 04:43.482
- Oh, because it happened
during sex?

04:43.484 --> 04:45.450
- I can neither confirm
nor deny.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.118
- Hmm, I see.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.820
I bet that kevin's a real
stingray in the sack.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.890
- Collin and I have to go
straight home after school,

04:51.892 --> 04:54.459
And we can't be
in your awesome video.

04:54.461 --> 04:55.327
We're so bummed.

04:55.329 --> 04:57.596
- If I had to guess
what your parents were doing,

04:57.598 --> 04:58.797
I'd say the pile driver.

04:58.799 --> 05:02.334
Or maybe the backwards
jellyfish.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.402
Why does collin
need to be there?

05:03.404 --> 05:05.704
- My mom needs help
getting to the bathroom

05:05.706 --> 05:07.539
Until my dad gets home.

05:07.541 --> 05:09.675
- You are released.

05:09.677 --> 05:10.575
I take that back.

05:10.577 --> 05:14.980
Must have been
the dirty santa claus.

05:19.218 --> 05:20.352
- Are you trying
to torture yourself,

05:20.354 --> 05:22.254
Or are you just
a straight-up creeper?

05:22.256 --> 05:24.556
- I am just trying
to wrap my head around

05:24.558 --> 05:26.525
How the hell
this happened.

05:26.527 --> 05:27.893
- Why do you care?

05:27.895 --> 05:30.028
Jenna is
a ho-bag-slut-machine

05:30.030 --> 05:32.130
Who humiliated you
in front of the world.

05:32.132 --> 05:35.300
- Yeah, but somewhere deep down,
she's still my friend.

05:35.302 --> 05:37.536
- You are so nice,
it's annoying.

05:37.538 --> 05:40.138
- The subject matter
for the after-school specials

05:40.140 --> 05:44.810
Ran the gamut from drunk moms
to teenage prostitution

05:44.812 --> 05:46.611
To rheumatoid arthritis.

05:46.613 --> 05:47.279
- [giggles]

05:47.281 --> 05:49.548
- Is that funny to you,
blondie?

05:49.550 --> 05:51.917
How funny you think it was
for poor carol ann,

05:51.919 --> 05:54.186
A skater on her way
to olympic gold

05:54.188 --> 05:56.254
Who woke up one day
and couldn't fit

05:56.256 --> 05:58.490
Her fat elephant feet
into her size 6 skates?

05:58.492 --> 05:59.925
- Not funny at all.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.194
- Even though every a.S.S.
Had a different message,

06:02.196 --> 06:06.531
They had the same six steps
to get you there.

06:17.310 --> 06:17.909
Number one,

06:17.911 --> 06:21.346
Establish the problem
of the main character,

06:21.348 --> 06:23.115
The troubled teen.

06:23.117 --> 06:23.749
- Can I play her?

06:23.751 --> 06:25.817
- Only if we end up doing
porn star runaway

06:25.819 --> 06:26.918
Or eating disorder.

06:26.920 --> 06:27.886
- Speaking of slutty,

06:27.888 --> 06:29.554
How did jenna
get out of this?

06:29.556 --> 06:30.355
- Can't talk about it.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.324
Let's just say it involved
a sex injury.

06:32.326 --> 06:36.461
- Of course it did.

06:36.463 --> 06:37.929
I have an idea.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.898
Why don't we do a story

06:39.900 --> 06:41.400
About a troubled loser girl

06:41.402 --> 06:43.168
Who's so desperate
for attention

06:43.170 --> 06:45.003
She tries to commit suicide,
fails,

06:45.005 --> 06:47.839
Then defies all odds
by becoming popular

06:47.841 --> 06:50.142
And then manages
slowly but surely

06:50.144 --> 06:53.044
To alienate everyone
in her life,

06:53.046 --> 06:56.148
And then she dies?

06:57.650 --> 06:59.918
- I think it's...

06:59.920 --> 07:01.953
Perfect.

07:01.955 --> 07:02.988
All we need is a title.

07:02.990 --> 07:07.259
- How about, <i>what are we gonna</i>
<i>do about jenny?</i>

07:07.261 --> 07:09.294
- I think we have a winner.

07:09.296 --> 07:11.897
<i>What are we gonna do about--</i>

07:11.899 --> 07:12.531
- Jenna.

07:12.533 --> 07:15.834
Seriously, you guys,
what are we gonna do about her?

07:15.836 --> 07:16.468
- I'm confused.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.736
I thought you never wanted
to talk to her again.

07:17.738 --> 07:20.071
- I don't wanna talk to her.
I wanna yell at her.

07:20.073 --> 07:20.906
- I kinda wanna smack her.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.941
- I tried to stay out of it,
but I can't just sit back

07:22.943 --> 07:26.278
And watch jenna drift into
amanda bynesville.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.612
- So what are we gonna do?

07:27.614 --> 07:29.681
- I think we're gonna need
some guidance

07:29.683 --> 07:32.284
Or some counseling.

07:32.286 --> 07:35.287
Or some guidance counseling.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.289
What do we do if we know
one of our friends

07:37.291 --> 07:38.723
Is in trouble?

07:38.725 --> 07:39.925
- I don't know,
talk to 'em, I guess.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.894
- But he, or she,
won't listen to us

07:42.896 --> 07:45.464
Because he, or she,
has been hanging out

07:45.466 --> 07:46.832
With a really bad dude.

07:46.834 --> 07:47.532
- Oh, I see.

07:47.534 --> 07:50.101
Your friend's having
a gender identity crisis.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.604
- No, our friend
is skipping school

07:52.606 --> 07:56.908
And turning into
a gange-head.

07:56.910 --> 07:59.544
- You strike me as being
very concerned

07:59.546 --> 08:00.812
About your friend.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.448
I'd go so far as
to call you

08:03.450 --> 08:06.618
The concerned friends.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.954
My advice is to get involved

08:08.956 --> 08:11.223
In an after-school activity.

08:11.225 --> 08:13.959
Ming, can you remove
your hat please?

08:19.899 --> 08:21.633
Have you ever thought
about acting?

08:21.635 --> 08:24.369
Tamara had a memorable
scenery-chewing turn

08:24.371 --> 08:26.938
In <i>dead stacey,</i>
but what about you two?

08:26.940 --> 08:27.906
- I was in it too.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.274
- Eh, not so memorable.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.242
- How is acting
going to help?

08:30.244 --> 08:32.277
- It'll free you up
as people.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.245
Okay, please stand up.

08:33.246 --> 08:36.982
I'd like to try
some improv.

08:36.984 --> 08:37.649
- I'm confused.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.116
- Yeah, what are we supposed
to be doing?

08:39.119 --> 08:40.684
- You're supposed
to be confused,

08:40.687 --> 08:42.053
And you are succeeding.

08:42.054 --> 08:44.389
You, you're about to be shipped
off to a german work camp.

08:44.391 --> 08:46.925
You can only bring one friend.
The other friend will die.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.260
Who do you choose?
Don't think!

08:48.262 --> 08:49.261
- I don't know,
I can't decide!

08:49.263 --> 08:51.663
But I would rather die than
kill off one of my friends.

08:51.665 --> 08:54.299
- Oh, impressive.

08:55.067 --> 08:59.738
