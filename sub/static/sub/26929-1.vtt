00:13.972 --> 00:16.975
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here together

00:17.058 --> 00:20.729
to celebrate the union
of two of my favorite pups.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.689
Is this a fairy tale?

00:23.148 --> 00:24.983
Is it love that I'm feeling?

00:25.233 --> 00:28.528
Oh, pull it together, you two.
It's a wedding, not a funeral.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.447
Oh, here. Ida, here.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.115
- Gracias.
- It's gonna be okay.

00:36.369 --> 00:37.245
Gracias.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.833
So, come on, everybody, get on up,

00:42.208 --> 00:46.004
and let's show these two
just how groovy puppy love can be.

What time is it?

03:12.525 --> 03:14.652
Uh... Two fifty, still.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.697
- They've been in there for hours.
- It's been five minutes.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.574
Look, these things take time.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.367
Okay? Just breathe.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.953
Remember Lamaze class. Hee, hee...

03:27.874 --> 03:30.168
- Good.
- I'm bugging out here.

03:30.460 --> 03:31.878
- Wait.
- Tiny, I'm coming.

03:33.504 --> 03:36.299
Just calm down, okay? Here, have a cigar.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.092
What? I don't smoke.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.637
- Yeah, I don't either, actually.
- I don't get it.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.722
- Why do we have cigars?
- I don't know.

03:42.805 --> 03:44.557
I got the call
that Tiny's having the puppies,

03:44.641 --> 03:46.517
I ran to the car, fell, hit my head,

03:46.601 --> 03:49.562
I was driving by a cigar shop,
and bought a bunch of cigars.

03:49.646 --> 03:53.149
I have no idea what was going on, okay?
I'm on autopilot right now.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.359
Would you just please...

03:55.235 --> 03:56.861
calm down, P.U.P.?

03:57.779 --> 03:59.239
Lou, Lou, Lou. The puppies.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.324
- Are they--?
- Can't talk. Getting towels.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.201
Shep, I'm dying out here.

04:03.284 --> 04:04.661
- Tiny, is she--?
- Steven.

04:04.744 --> 04:08.122
I'm sterilizing.
I don't have time for your melodrama.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.832
- But wait--
- You're killing me.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.168
- That goes for you, too, Papa.
- What--?

04:13.211 --> 04:14.212
Ida, Tiny.

04:14.587 --> 04:18.507
Tiny's doing great, Mr. Steven.
And the puppies are coming soon, too.

04:18.591 --> 04:19.801
I'm already flipping my fur.

04:20.176 --> 04:23.888
We can't bring the puppies into this world
to meet esta gente loca, can we?

04:24.097 --> 04:26.099
- No. Yes. I mean, no.
- Cuckoo.

04:26.182 --> 04:27.809
We're not loca. We're fine.

04:27.892 --> 04:29.477
We're normal. We're not crazy.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.187
- You're more cuckoo than that clock.
- Okay?

04:31.688 --> 04:32.605
Cuckoo.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.819
- Towels, incoming.
- Water to go.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.028
- We have hot water.
- Hot.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.238
- Hot water.
- Hot water.

04:40.822 --> 04:41.698
Ah.

04:42.991 --> 04:43.825
I need a nap.

04:49.247 --> 04:50.164
Cuckoo.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.339
Time to wake up, Papa.

04:58.464 --> 04:59.340
Hmm?

04:59.424 --> 05:00.258
The puppies are here.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.802
What happened? What--? Where--?

05:03.303 --> 05:05.263
Three adorable girls.

05:05.513 --> 05:08.891
Rosie, Charlie,
and the tiniest one, Cindy.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.562
And a very handsome boy, Brody.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.441
Aren't they
the most beautiful puppies ever?

05:16.816 --> 05:18.192
Yes, they are, old pal.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.195
Oh, my dog.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.947
Tiny? Is she okay?

05:24.032 --> 05:26.492
- Um...
- Well, come see for yourselves.

05:26.576 --> 05:27.410
Come on.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.586
How you doing, darling?

05:36.836 --> 05:40.173
I can truly say
that I've never, ever been better.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.968
We're going to be good parents, right?

05:46.220 --> 05:48.264
We're gonna be awesome.

05:50.933 --> 05:56.355
Those orphans have foiled Julio
for the last time.

06:04.947 --> 06:05.782
Say it.

06:06.616 --> 06:07.450
Say the line.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.911
Holy frijoles, mi amoeba.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.705
Evil just got a lot better-looking.

06:12.789 --> 06:13.623
Cut.

06:14.040 --> 06:14.874
Cut.

06:15.124 --> 06:15.958
Finally.

06:16.250 --> 06:19.545
Please, tell Julio he can start acting,
any time now.

06:19.629 --> 06:20.588
Ai-yai-ai.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.175
Lo siento, everybody.

06:24.467 --> 06:26.427
The gringo is still adjusting.

06:26.803 --> 06:28.304
If I'm so bad, why am I here?

06:28.638 --> 06:29.889
Ratings, idiota.

06:30.181 --> 06:31.516
You're like a car crash.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.142
You miserable little imp.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.645
I can't do this anymore.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.357
Get these amateurs off my set.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.401
This show won't last two episodes
without me.

06:42.485 --> 06:43.611
Do you know who I am?

06:44.320 --> 06:45.947
Yes.

06:46.364 --> 06:50.201
An out-of-work gringo actor.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.370
Somebody get me Casting.

06:52.662 --> 06:53.830
I need two dogs.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.207
One a medium, one a Chihuahua.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.835
There is only one Julio.

07:00.545 --> 07:05.133
How hard do you think it will be

07:05.341 --> 07:07.760
to find a Chihuahua?

07:09.428 --> 07:10.680
This is Mexico.

07:12.056 --> 07:13.933
Uh... Wait, what?

07:15.184 --> 07:16.811
What just happened? This is bad.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.563
Julio is confused.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.356
Wait, wait, wait.

07:20.690 --> 07:21.816
I can play both parts.

07:21.899 --> 07:22.900
I'll work for scale.

07:24.360 --> 07:28.364
Come on, scaredy-cat.
Get in there and stamp it down.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.575
This is so gross.

07:36.372 --> 07:37.832
Hey.

07:37.915 --> 07:38.749
Wait.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.419
Kano. Something's moving in here.

07:41.502 --> 07:42.920
Better keep stamping.

07:46.757 --> 07:47.592
What the...?

07:51.304 --> 07:53.347
Hey, you. Turn that camera off.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.019
Oh, you think this is funny?

07:59.937 --> 08:01.272
How's this for a headline?

08:01.522 --> 08:04.025
"Hack reporter gets free ambulance ride."

08:07.487 --> 08:09.530
You're watching DMZ.

08:10.448 --> 08:11.908
Way to take a hit.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.827
Glad it's you, and not me, Micky.
Looks rough.

08:15.703 --> 08:16.537
Worth it.

08:16.787 --> 08:18.581
You're a true journalist.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.751
Mean Team, you're the ultimate losers.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.255
Trash taking out trash, right?

08:26.589 --> 08:29.383
And how do you get fired
from your own show?

08:29.717 --> 08:30.593
Am I right, guys?

08:33.304 --> 08:36.599
Just when you thought you couldn't
sink any lower than daytime TV.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.601
I guess crime doesn't pay.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.269
You said-- What do you mean?

08:44.398 --> 08:46.651
- Charlie, Rosie, Cindy.
- What's up, Bro?

08:46.734 --> 08:48.903
You will not believe
what's going on in the kitchen.

08:48.986 --> 08:51.697
- Breathe, Brody, breathe.
- Come on, come on.

08:54.242 --> 08:56.702
Mm. Turkey time.

08:58.412 --> 09:02.166
- Mm. Yes.
- You know, when I first came to America,

09:02.375 --> 09:05.044
I thought you were all loco
with the Thanksgiving.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.754
Pero now... Whoo.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.632
I love the pumpkin pie.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.717
Yes. Mmm.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.804
Oh! Mr. Steven.
You will spoil your dinner.

09:14.929 --> 09:15.763
Okay.

09:15.846 --> 09:16.681
Okay.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.058
Hot.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.309
Oy, no, no, no.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.104
It says right here
in my Julia Child cookbook,

09:23.187 --> 09:25.773
you cannot start carving for 15 minutes.

09:25.856 --> 09:27.400
Okay, okay.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.443
- Mm-hm.
- Let's set the table.

09:29.944 --> 09:32.613
Yes, I love the Thanksgiving table.

09:32.697 --> 09:35.241
Bro,
I think you just found the mother lode.

09:35.491 --> 09:38.202
It smells so delicious.

09:38.286 --> 09:41.622
Forget how it smells, Rosie.
I wanna know how it tastes.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.457
Brody, we can't do that.

09:43.541 --> 09:44.667
What if it's poisoned?

09:44.750 --> 09:46.794
What are you even talking about, Brody?

09:46.877 --> 09:50.673
I know.
What if I take a bite, and test it first?

09:50.756 --> 09:54.093
If there's no poison,
it's just a teensy bite, right?

09:54.510 --> 09:56.887
But if there is, I'm a hero.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.473
You know that doesn't make any sense,
right?

10:08.816 --> 10:09.650
Come on.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.528
The puppies' first Thanksgiving.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.031
I can't believe it's already here.

10:15.114 --> 10:18.242
It's kind of magical,
seeing a holiday through our pups' eyes.

10:18.367 --> 10:21.162
Heh. When I was their age,
I was on the streets.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.456
Spitting rhymes and hustling full-time.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.133
Oh, man.

10:34.216 --> 10:37.803
My first bite of turkey. Hallelujah.

10:38.095 --> 10:39.889
Brody, is it poisoned?

10:40.014 --> 10:41.474
Uh... I can't tell.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.768
I, uh... gotta keep checking.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.854
- Hey, he can't stop eating.
- So good.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.939
He's got golden retriever fever.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.527
Uh-oh.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.280
I told you, guys, this was a bad idea.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.075
Well, we can't let it go to waste.

10:59.158 --> 11:00.951
We've gotta hide the evidence.

11:04.038 --> 11:06.624
Now... where's that pie?

11:09.669 --> 11:11.462
Guys, snap out of it.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.839
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on in here?

11:15.716 --> 11:18.761
Uh, happy Thanksgiving, loving family.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.849
- My pumpkin pie.
- It's...

11:24.183 --> 11:25.226
What the...?

11:25.810 --> 11:26.644
Come on.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.896
I know what this looks like, but...

11:29.397 --> 11:30.231
Great news.

11:30.314 --> 11:32.733
The turkey isn't poisoned.

11:33.901 --> 11:35.236
It was all Brody's idea.

11:35.361 --> 11:36.946
He's the mastermind.

11:37.071 --> 11:38.948
- Oh.
- Bus chucker.

11:39.031 --> 11:39.865
Turkey hucker.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.118
Stop snitching.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.370
Rule número uno:

11:44.787 --> 11:46.247
Never admit guilt.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.373
We plead the Fifth.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.750
Grandpa Steve, you're our lawyer.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.377
- What?
- Well, I'm the judge,

11:51.877 --> 11:52.962
they're the hungry jury,

11:53.337 --> 11:55.464
and you're all doing time in your room.

12:00.094 --> 12:02.680
Tough love, sis.
I'm telling you, it works.

12:03.013 --> 12:05.057
It's not like them to act out like this.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.977
Maybe we're not spending enough time
with them.

12:08.269 --> 12:09.353
That's a possibility.

12:09.812 --> 12:12.356
We have been spending a lot of time
at the studio.

12:12.731 --> 12:15.693
And the live shows, and the galas,
and the...

12:16.277 --> 12:17.278
Oh, jeez.

12:17.611 --> 12:19.989
Oh, no. We're deadbeat parents.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.575
You can spend some quality time with them.

12:23.742 --> 12:26.495
And you could create
your own family traditions.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.789
Lou, you genius.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.876
Pup Star: A Puppy Star Christmas.

12:32.334 --> 12:35.421
Oh! Chestpups Roasting on an Open...

12:35.963 --> 12:37.548
We'll circle back to the title.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.926
But, headline, "ratings gold."

12:41.218 --> 12:43.679
Lou, you always have the best advice.

12:43.929 --> 12:47.016
A little family time will turn those pups
right around.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.351
In that case,
I think it's time we taught them

12:49.435 --> 12:50.811
about the Christmas spirit.

12:51.061 --> 12:54.690
Family, sharing,
and not destroying my turkey.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.442
Or my pumpkin pie.

12:58.736 --> 12:59.945
Why are they so uptight?

13:00.613 --> 13:03.199
Either way,
that turkey was going to get eaten.

13:03.491 --> 13:06.368
And Ida's pie was delicious.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.913
Guys, you're missing the point here.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.164
Uh...

13:10.789 --> 13:11.790
You're right, sis.

13:12.249 --> 13:16.170
We didn't even get to taste
Grandpa Steven's world-famous stuffing.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.297
That's not what I meant.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.884
Ida and Grandpa worked really hard,
getting dinner ready.

13:22.009 --> 13:25.304
Maybe we didn't consider the consequences.

13:25.804 --> 13:27.723
No, that can't be it.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.267
Quick. Uh...

13:30.351 --> 13:31.936
Look like we learned something.

13:35.856 --> 13:38.567
I think all of yous need
to apologize to Grandpa.

13:38.817 --> 13:41.529
We're sorry, Ida and Grandpa Steven.

13:42.112 --> 13:46.075
I guess we just couldn't
resist your amazing cooking.

13:46.325 --> 13:47.159
Aw...

13:47.243 --> 13:49.912
- It's hard to argue with that, right?
- Right, yeah.

13:50.037 --> 13:50.871
Okay.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.415
What Grandpa means to say is...

13:53.832 --> 13:54.667
Right.

13:55.167 --> 13:56.252
We all make mistakes.

13:56.335 --> 13:58.546
The important thing
is that we recognize them

13:58.629 --> 13:59.630
and not repeat them.

13:59.713 --> 14:00.548
Yeah.

14:01.549 --> 14:04.426
Roll back.
I think I missed something here.

14:05.469 --> 14:08.222
Well, pups,
Christmas is just around the corner,

14:08.305 --> 14:11.058
and it's time you learned
the true meaning of Christmas.

14:11.392 --> 14:14.812
Grandpa Steven's going
to read you his favorite Christmas book.

14:15.271 --> 14:17.106
Santa and the Naughty Elf.

14:18.023 --> 14:18.857
Uh...

14:19.775 --> 14:22.695

You wouldn't understand.

17:34.678 --> 17:36.263
You're used to living in trash.

17:36.346 --> 17:39.558
And now I'm used to living with trash.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.062
You've been zinged.

17:45.355 --> 17:46.690
I crack myself up.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.820
If it wasn't for Tiny
and that fleabag rapper,

17:51.904 --> 17:53.363
I'd own Pup Star.

17:56.742 --> 17:59.661
Allow me to introduce the Purina czarina,

18:00.245 --> 18:02.331
the furshionista that is fur,

18:02.539 --> 18:04.792
the canine queen
and everything in between--

18:05.000 --> 18:07.127
Just-- Just let them talk.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.338
Okay. I mean...

18:09.421 --> 18:10.923
Happy holidays, everybody.

18:13.133 --> 18:15.260
Is there no end to my humiliation?

18:17.513 --> 18:19.348
Pup Star and Dawg Pound Records

18:19.640 --> 18:23.143
are proud to present
the first ever Pup Star Christmas Special.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.647
Our friends will be there.
Scrappy, Lady Paw Paw...

18:26.730 --> 18:28.023
Julio, translate.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.400
You still can't speak Spanish?

18:32.444 --> 18:34.404
Learn the language, Americano.

18:34.488 --> 18:37.074
Listen, I have minions to speak it for me.

18:37.157 --> 18:38.492
Minions like you.

18:38.575 --> 18:39.785
Okay, so, he's saying...

18:40.202 --> 18:43.038
Tiny's putting on
a Pup Star Christmas special

18:43.205 --> 18:44.706
in honor of her new familia.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.921
But props to our main man, Shep,
for booking us the best guest star ever.

18:51.004 --> 18:52.673
We got Santa Claus.

18:52.756 --> 18:53.924
You got Santa?

18:54.383 --> 18:55.217
We have Santa?

18:55.717 --> 18:56.885
With special guest...

18:57.302 --> 18:59.304
- Santa Claus?
- Santa Claus.

19:02.057 --> 19:06.395
Uh, surely my invitation
has simply been lost in the e-mail. Heh.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.272
Well, well, well.

19:08.772 --> 19:11.024
Julio, what's bigger than Christmas?

19:11.108 --> 19:12.025
Nothing.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.862
It is the most sacred of holidays.

19:15.696 --> 19:18.490
Unless there was a Julio de Mayo,
of course.

19:35.215 --> 19:36.717
Don't blame yourself, Charlie.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.010
Chess is a tough game.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.846
Minutes to learn, years to master.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.099
Hey, look, Ida has a charcuterie board.

19:45.475 --> 19:46.894
Sweet cheeses and meat.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.022
For you, Shep.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.024
Charlie, what are you doing?

19:52.107 --> 19:53.317
That's cheating.

19:53.442 --> 19:56.403
Shh. Go be a Goody Two-shoes
somewhere else, Cindy.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.322
I'm fleecing this rube.

19:59.406 --> 20:00.741
- Mm.
- Checkmate.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.955
Hang in there, Uncle Shep.
Your luck will change.

20:09.082 --> 20:10.250
Best seven out of 13?

20:10.626 --> 20:12.294
Hey, man, it's your loot.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.922
♪ Five new headshots ♪

20:30.395 --> 20:31.855
You're a natural.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.398
Yes, Rosie.

20:33.482 --> 20:36.735
Okay, okay, I know what you're thinking.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.195
Star power.

20:38.278 --> 20:39.279
It factor.

20:39.696 --> 20:41.073
Glamour.

20:43.533 --> 20:46.245
Brody? Brody,
what are you doing with Grandpa's lights?

20:46.703 --> 20:47.537
Oh, my--

20:50.207 --> 20:51.041
Ida.

20:51.375 --> 20:54.336
- Ida, get the ladder.
- Oh, my goodness. Oh, Mr. Steven.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.421
- Okay, okay, I'm coming. Okay.
- Come on.

20:56.755 --> 20:57.589
Oh, my God.

21:00.884 --> 21:02.386
- Uh-oh.
- You hang on there.

21:02.469 --> 21:04.805
- Maybe he won't think it was me.
- Hurry.

21:06.848 --> 21:07.891
Cindy.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.269
What do you have there?

21:10.852 --> 21:14.314
I found it in a box
with our Christmas decorations.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.233
That was my mom's favorite ornament.

21:18.610 --> 21:21.905
Thank you, Auntie Lou.
You're the best auntie ever.

21:22.364 --> 21:23.282
Mm.

21:30.539 --> 21:31.748
Coming through.

21:32.541 --> 21:33.667
Oh, oh, oh!

21:37.296 --> 21:38.297
Surprise.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.508
I love gingerbread.

21:55.230 --> 21:57.357
- How's that look?
- It's beautiful.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.276
We did good.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.571
- You did amazing.
- It's so beautiful.

22:10.912 --> 22:11.747
Hey.

22:12.289 --> 22:13.623
Did you steal my sandwich?

22:13.707 --> 22:14.708
Look, it's gone.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.460
Just buy a new sandwich.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.462
Oh, yeah. Sure, Mr. Moneybags.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.088
On a garbageman's salary?

22:22.132 --> 22:25.260
Well, aren't you two a sorry sight?

22:25.677 --> 22:28.180
I told you
to never show your mug here again.

22:28.555 --> 22:30.599
I'll wreck you like a squeaky toy.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.394
No, no.

22:34.478 --> 22:35.312
No. Kano.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.189
Yes, yes, yes, Bark.

22:37.272 --> 22:39.316
Beat it. We've got paying jobs.

22:39.399 --> 22:43.862
Honest, smelly, lousy, paying jobs.

22:44.279 --> 22:45.280
Hola, Roland.

22:45.363 --> 22:47.032
Good to see you again, compadre.

22:47.115 --> 22:48.241
My money's on Kano.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.243
I'd put 3-to-1 on Bark.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.496
He is very tricky, no?

22:52.579 --> 22:53.455
Kano.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.416
I've got a new plan, and it's foolproof.

22:56.958 --> 22:57.793
Oh!

22:58.710 --> 22:59.878
Score.

23:01.463 --> 23:03.715
You say that every time.

23:03.840 --> 23:07.094
And guess what.
Every time, it doesn't work.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.554
Just hear me out.

23:09.638 --> 23:10.472
Wanna try?

23:11.556 --> 23:13.266
Kano, what's bigger than Pup Star?

23:13.350 --> 23:14.726
Oh. I know, I know.

23:15.769 --> 23:16.770
Mr. Rogers.

23:16.895 --> 23:19.064
Idiot. Christmas.

23:19.147 --> 23:22.651
People have to buy presents,
no matter what.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.820
No, not in Mexico.

23:24.903 --> 23:27.864
Santa brings gifts
for the poor niños and pups.

23:28.115 --> 23:31.034
Only if they've been good all year,
of course.

23:31.118 --> 23:32.577
Not anymore, he doesn't.

23:32.661 --> 23:34.579
We are gonna run the North Pole.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.623
You wanna take over Christmas?

23:37.040 --> 23:38.500
That's quite the score.

23:38.583 --> 23:41.044
Enough loot for every kid on earth.

23:41.128 --> 23:42.712
All right, I'm in.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.172
Me, too.

23:44.464 --> 23:45.340
On one condition.

23:45.757 --> 23:47.467
I get to fly the reindeer.

23:47.551 --> 23:50.095
Yes, you can fly the reindeer.

23:50.512 --> 23:51.346
Yes.

23:51.721 --> 23:53.140
Yes. Yes.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.851
Ah. Finally.

23:56.101 --> 23:59.563
Muy bien, everyone's in,
los cuatro amigos.

23:59.688 --> 24:02.524
- Yeah.
- Now may we please go somewhere warm?

24:02.607 --> 24:04.901
Because Julio is not built for the cold.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.194
Do you wanna tell him?

24:06.278 --> 24:08.113
He'll figure it out soon enough.

24:30.135 --> 24:30.969
Good to see you.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.221
Good to see you.

24:40.187 --> 24:42.022
How do we get to the North Pole?

24:45.192 --> 24:46.026
Thank you.

24:48.737 --> 24:49.654
Good to see you.

24:57.037 --> 24:58.955
Okay. We'll need some disguises.

25:03.376 --> 25:05.462
Watch your step. It's slippery out there.

25:05.795 --> 25:06.630
With the snow.

25:07.881 --> 25:13.428
Hey, did somebody leave a giant bag
of candy canes back here?

25:13.637 --> 25:14.846
- What?
- Yeah.

25:14.930 --> 25:15.847
Let me get some.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.265
- Let's get them all.
- Yeah.

25:17.557 --> 25:18.850
- Yeah.
- All right.

25:18.934 --> 25:21.645
- Hey, where's the candy cane?
- You can't do that.

25:21.728 --> 25:24.022
- I can't eat that.
- Hey. That belongs to me.

25:29.402 --> 25:31.905
And that's
where a sugar addiction will get you.

25:32.656 --> 25:33.531
It's sad, really.

25:37.994 --> 25:39.412
Oh. Heh.

25:39.996 --> 25:42.123
All aboard to Santa's workshop.

25:42.207 --> 25:44.793
Oh. Mama, that's good.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.587
Zip it. We've got a ride to catch.

25:59.849 --> 26:02.018
Sorry, gang,
you gotta take the next coach.

26:02.102 --> 26:03.061
Only one seat left.

26:03.520 --> 26:04.354
I got this.

26:08.650 --> 26:10.151
- Get out.
- Oh!

26:10.235 --> 26:12.112
That's not a very holly-jolly attitude.

26:12.320 --> 26:14.489
- You're on the naughty list.
- You're not very nice.

26:14.572 --> 26:17.784
- No Christmas spirit in there.
- Look, two seats just opened up.

26:18.285 --> 26:19.744
What luck.

26:21.538 --> 26:22.914
- Julio...
- Is he okay?

26:23.248 --> 26:24.082
Julio-cicle?

26:24.708 --> 26:26.960
Oh, yeah. He's just not used to the cold.

26:28.169 --> 26:29.963
- Right?
- Freezing.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.266
There we go. Lock it up.

26:42.767 --> 26:45.854
Hyah! Next stop, Santa's workshop.

26:48.398 --> 26:50.066
Excuse me. Camera coming through.

26:50.608 --> 26:53.445
Shep. What--? What are you doing?

26:53.528 --> 26:55.613
Oh, this old thing? Heh.

26:55.697 --> 26:57.824
Standing in for Santa, like an understudy.

26:58.491 --> 27:01.161
- Mr. Steven, out of my way.
- Reindeer, coming through.

27:01.244 --> 27:03.371
- That's right. Come on.
- Only in the way, sir?

27:03.455 --> 27:05.040
- Let's go.
- Watch yourself, sir.

27:05.123 --> 27:05.957
Nutcrackers.

27:08.543 --> 27:13.423
Finally, a venue big enough
to showcase my talents.

27:13.631 --> 27:15.550
And your ever-expanding head.

27:16.217 --> 27:17.635
Hey, there's my pups.

27:18.261 --> 27:20.263
You guys ready to run your big entrance?

27:20.638 --> 27:23.266
Was that a serious question?

27:23.600 --> 27:25.101
I was born ready.

27:25.727 --> 27:29.022
Great. We're running the top and the tail,
so, watch for your cue.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.069
Hyah, hyah, hyah!

27:37.864 --> 27:39.324
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

27:44.287 --> 27:45.789
Welcome to the North Pole.

27:46.956 --> 27:48.208
- There you go.
- Thank you.

27:51.628 --> 27:53.505
- Watch your step.
- Thank you.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.006
All right.

27:55.340 --> 28:00.887
So, we are past quota
on mega blocks, whirly tubes...

28:00.970 --> 28:01.888
Good, good.

28:02.597 --> 28:03.556
Yo-yos?

28:03.848 --> 28:04.682
Yo-yos.

28:05.016 --> 28:07.102
Moon shoes and wiffle bats.

28:07.560 --> 28:10.146
And for some unknown reason...

28:10.772 --> 28:13.400
candy cane pattern fidget spinners.

28:16.861 --> 28:19.989
Guys, this is serious business.
Get back to work.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.032
Jackpot.

28:21.741 --> 28:24.786
This'll be easier than taking biscuits
from a puppy.

28:26.913 --> 28:27.747
I'm coming.

28:28.873 --> 28:29.707
Something funny?

28:30.959 --> 28:33.962
You guys act like you've never been
to the North Pole before.

28:35.880 --> 28:38.299
Oh, yeah, it's, uh, been a while.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.218
Been on sabbatical.

28:41.302 --> 28:43.138
I see we're still using ribbons.

28:43.471 --> 28:44.305
That's nice.

28:44.806 --> 28:45.682
Uh-huh.

28:46.224 --> 28:48.435
Yeah, well, we're South Pole elves.

28:48.518 --> 28:49.352
This is Goofy,

28:50.145 --> 28:52.397
Sleepy, Grumpy,

28:52.480 --> 28:53.648
and I'm Bashful.

28:57.026 --> 28:58.278
Those are dwarf names.

28:58.528 --> 29:00.029
Elf names start with E.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.824
I'm Eli. This is Eddy.

29:03.450 --> 29:04.284
He's Elon.

29:04.367 --> 29:05.201
Get the picture?

29:05.493 --> 29:07.746
Well, Nosey with a capital E,

29:07.829 --> 29:10.248
we're the Big Man's
new undercover security team.

29:10.498 --> 29:13.084
And you don't wanna get
on our naughty list, do you?

29:18.590 --> 29:19.549
Oh.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.259
Julio? Are you okay?

29:21.968 --> 29:24.846
Guys,
wrapping paper doesn't grow on trees.

29:29.434 --> 29:32.896
Uh, tell me, my good elves,
where might we find Santa?

29:33.354 --> 29:35.231
My guess,
since it's the middle of the work day,

29:35.315 --> 29:37.859
he's taking a Yuletide nap in his cottage.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.278
Thank you.

29:40.904 --> 29:41.738
Excuse me.

29:44.949 --> 29:45.784
All right, Tiny.

29:46.075 --> 29:49.287
Here we are in the North Pole,
doing our first Christmas special.

29:49.370 --> 29:50.371
I'm so excited.

29:50.705 --> 29:53.208
Christmas is my favorite time of the year.

29:53.291 --> 29:55.251
Oh, no, no, Gnarly, please.

29:55.376 --> 29:57.712
Let me pull the sleigh all by myself.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.173
Try pulling in a straight line, mon.

30:00.256 --> 30:02.008
You been hitting the catnip again.

30:02.091 --> 30:05.178
Go visit a barber,
I'm as straight as an arrow.

30:05.261 --> 30:07.555
Cut, cut. Take five, everybody.

30:08.306 --> 30:11.100
Hey, Simon,
where's that Christmas spirit, dog?

30:11.392 --> 30:14.813
And suddenly,
the antlers aren't enough anymore.

30:14.896 --> 30:18.399
I shall be celebrating Christmas
in my trailer.

30:22.654 --> 30:24.322
That's beautiful. It's beautiful.

30:24.656 --> 30:25.782
Okay, okay, okay.

30:26.115 --> 30:26.950
I got this.

30:27.325 --> 30:30.537
I have a plan, the perfect plan.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.831
Actually, I can't wait to hear this.

30:32.914 --> 30:36.167
I can have a plan, Kano.

30:36.459 --> 30:38.086
Oh, do tell.

30:38.169 --> 30:41.589
I'll surprise him
by going down the chimney, Santa-style.

30:41.714 --> 30:43.049
He'll never see it coming.

30:44.717 --> 30:46.261
How original.

30:46.761 --> 30:47.595
Thank you.

30:47.971 --> 30:50.098
And I bet I can just fly up there.

30:51.057 --> 30:51.891
Check it out.

30:55.144 --> 30:56.187
Here you go.

31:03.069 --> 31:07.156
Is it weird I want him to succeed
and fall down the chimney into the fire?

31:13.121 --> 31:16.374
- Oh, great. He'll brag about this forever.
- Top of the world.

31:17.041 --> 31:18.626
That's right. That's right.

31:18.793 --> 31:21.045
I'm here, I'm here, I'm here--

31:21.588 --> 31:22.422
Whoa!

31:25.967 --> 31:28.428
Dumb is forever.

31:44.235 --> 31:46.362
How about we try the front door?

31:47.113 --> 31:48.072
That's a good plan.

32:00.919 --> 32:02.545
What is the meaning of this?

32:02.629 --> 32:06.174
Sorry, big guy,
but there's a new Santa in town.

32:07.508 --> 32:08.343
Me.

32:08.760 --> 32:09.886
You've been downsized.

32:17.977 --> 32:20.730
- Back it up.
- Remember, pups, you're up right after me.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.107
We won't let you down, Mr. Shep.

32:23.191 --> 32:27.654
Obviously, saving the best for last,
per usual.

32:29.238 --> 32:32.075
I wonder what sweet swag
Santa's bringing us this year.

32:32.158 --> 32:34.953
I don't know. It's a big surprise.

32:36.579 --> 32:38.081
But where's Santa?

32:38.206 --> 32:39.874
That's my cue.

32:40.833 --> 32:41.668
Wait.

32:41.960 --> 32:42.961
Is that my cue?

32:43.878 --> 32:46.005
I-- No sé, I'm busy.

32:47.548 --> 32:48.758
Yo, Santa. Where you at?

32:49.258 --> 32:51.260
- Put it down.
- That light right now.

32:51.344 --> 32:52.261
Dramatic entrance.

32:52.345 --> 32:54.305
I sure hope Santa shows up.

32:54.389 --> 32:55.848
Sometime soon?

32:55.932 --> 32:57.433
Today, maybe?

32:57.517 --> 32:59.185
Here's Santa.

32:59.602 --> 33:01.229
Five, six, seven, eight.

33:01.479 --> 33:05.984
Moving downstage.
And you sing. You dance. It's awesome.

33:06.067 --> 33:09.195
Pas de bourrée, booty quake, booty quake.

33:09.278 --> 33:12.490
Dab, whip, dab, and jazz hands.

33:13.449 --> 33:14.534
Glad you could join us, SC.

33:14.909 --> 33:17.662
Oh, uh... Ho ho ho. Heh.

33:17.745 --> 33:19.622
It took a little while, Tiny,

33:19.706 --> 33:22.458
but I think
I found you the perfect present.

33:22.792 --> 33:24.836
Wait, Santa, do you mean...?

33:24.919 --> 33:27.547
Are you for reals, Santa?

33:29.465 --> 33:33.011
You guys are getting
the best Christmas present of all time.

33:35.513 --> 33:36.347
Well, uh...

33:37.265 --> 33:38.808
definitely a big surprise.

33:40.935 --> 33:41.978
Ugh.

33:42.103 --> 33:45.523
How can one show have so many words
and zero ninjas?

33:46.733 --> 33:50.278
These costumes are embarrassing.
Not even designer knockoffs.

33:50.361 --> 33:54.699
I mean, come on, people.
No elf princesses?

33:56.617 --> 33:57.535
Uh...

33:58.161 --> 34:00.455
"Say hello to your Christmas surprise."

34:01.622 --> 34:03.041
Cut. Reset.

34:03.791 --> 34:05.126
Tenth time's the charm.

34:09.213 --> 34:12.132
Ugh, someone told me a fib.

34:12.216 --> 34:13.676
This is not Miami.

34:14.052 --> 34:15.428
I am certain of that now.

34:15.511 --> 34:16.596
No, really?

34:16.679 --> 34:18.139
We must've made a wrong turn.

34:18.222 --> 34:19.974
So sorry, short stack.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.271
Nice duds, huh?

34:25.980 --> 34:29.108
Now I can give myself
that electric train you never brought me.

34:32.779 --> 34:34.572
Am I growing a beard?

34:35.572 --> 34:40.244
It takes more than a belly full of cookies
to wear that suit.

34:40.745 --> 34:44.623
You can't be in the naughty list,
for starters.

34:45.208 --> 34:48.795
Oh. Well, then let's rewrite history
a little, shall we?

34:53.299 --> 34:54.300
Hmm.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.052
Ah. Here we are.

35:08.397 --> 35:09.565
Stupid Christmas.

35:10.024 --> 35:12.485
All right, what's the scam this time?

35:13.402 --> 35:15.947
Ha-ha. The scam, ahem...

35:16.447 --> 35:19.951
or the plan, as I like to call it,

35:20.284 --> 35:22.870
is that we are-- We're, uh...

35:24.497 --> 35:26.082
What exactly is the plan again?

35:26.541 --> 35:29.794
I'm appealing to the most powerful emotion
of human- and dogkind.

35:30.169 --> 35:31.420
Love and kindness.

35:33.381 --> 35:34.215
Greed.

35:34.841 --> 35:36.676
- Simple commerce, really.
- Oh.

35:37.635 --> 35:41.514
You're sadly underestimating the goodness
of the human heart.

35:42.014 --> 35:42.849
Am I?

35:43.391 --> 35:45.643
Everyone wants their kids and pups
to wake up

35:45.726 --> 35:49.897
to toys, or gifts, or cookies,
or whatever, on Christmas morning.

35:49.981 --> 35:53.484
Well, now they're gonna buy it
from the greatest brand of all time:

35:54.235 --> 35:55.319
Santa Claus.

35:57.655 --> 36:01.492
Then we go to Miami,
and thaw out on the beach with chiquitas.

36:02.076 --> 36:04.745
Christmas spirit doesn't
come in packages, Bark.

36:05.413 --> 36:09.458
You can't sell people good times
with the people they love.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.337
Any of this ringing a bell?

36:13.713 --> 36:15.214
Hmm. No.

36:15.298 --> 36:18.050
Surely you have people you love,
don't you?

36:18.634 --> 36:20.469
Oh, get with the times, old man.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.347
Humans and dogs are insatiable.
They'll buy anything.

36:24.432 --> 36:26.976
If they don't,
we put coal in their stockings.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.686
The ultimate punishment.

36:31.814 --> 36:33.149
That's no bueno.

36:35.568 --> 36:36.736
Here's your mail.

36:44.493 --> 36:46.871
Come on, get up. We got mail.

36:46.954 --> 36:49.999
Did Santa write us back,
about our list of demands?

36:50.124 --> 36:53.169
Uh... Nothing but catalogs and bills.

36:53.669 --> 36:56.422
Maybe we didn't make the nice list.

36:56.505 --> 37:00.343
No way. I mean, sure,
we've got a few minor infractions,

37:00.426 --> 37:01.761
but we've served our time.

37:01.886 --> 37:03.137
Right? Right?

37:03.554 --> 37:06.724
I got it. Santa's the surprise guest star
of the show, right?

37:07.141 --> 37:09.435
Whoa, whoa, whoa, say what?

37:09.977 --> 37:12.271
Dad said I was the guest star.

37:12.355 --> 37:13.272
Keep going, sis.

37:13.648 --> 37:16.025
The diva needs some time
to process the obvious.

37:16.108 --> 37:17.568
We sneak into Santa's sleigh,

37:17.652 --> 37:20.321
fly to the North Pole,
and demand the loot we deserve.

37:20.696 --> 37:23.199
In and out.
Back in time for Christmas. Easy-peasy.

37:23.699 --> 37:26.327
All in favor, say "aye." Aye.

37:26.410 --> 37:27.370
- Aye.
- Aye.

37:27.453 --> 37:29.413
- Nay.
- That's unanimous.

37:30.039 --> 37:33.334
I'm pretty sure that's
not what "unanimous" means.

37:34.085 --> 37:37.505
Ebob, I need you to go around
and collect all these fidget spinners.

37:39.924 --> 37:41.133
Uh...

37:42.510 --> 37:43.594
What's going on here?

37:44.971 --> 37:46.097
There's a merry-go-round?

37:46.180 --> 37:50.017
Poor Santa and Mrs. Claus have come down
with a very bad flu.

37:50.101 --> 37:53.020
- Oh. I better check on them right away--
- That's not possible.

37:54.438 --> 37:56.732
He's under quarantine.
It's very contagious.

37:57.608 --> 37:58.943
Especially to elves.

38:00.444 --> 38:02.488
That's why we're here
to pick up the slack.

38:02.571 --> 38:05.616
- Yeah.
- Yes. And he wants to make sure

38:05.866 --> 38:09.704
the elves are able
to fulfill their orders for Navidad.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.580
Orders? You mean wishes?

38:12.248 --> 38:13.958
Orders, wishes, whatever.

38:14.041 --> 38:17.253
Listen, Roland will be filling in
for Santa in the meantime.

38:17.336 --> 38:20.464
Yes, and I will need full access
to Santa's lists,

38:21.048 --> 38:21.966
cookie supply,

38:22.300 --> 38:24.302
and, of course, the reindeer and sleigh.

38:25.970 --> 38:27.847
This is highly unusual.

38:28.264 --> 38:29.515
Why is the room spinning?

38:29.890 --> 38:35.062
As you can see, this is an official order
from the Big Man himself. Mm-hm.

38:35.604 --> 38:38.149
"By the order of Santa...
Christmas authority...

38:38.858 --> 38:40.943
Bark hereby officially..."

38:41.027 --> 38:43.821
Go ahead, take a real close look.

38:43.946 --> 38:44.864
Uh...

38:45.239 --> 38:46.741
Heh. Looks legit.

38:47.408 --> 38:48.826
Okay. Uh, everyone...

38:50.036 --> 38:51.037
This is the boss.

38:51.996 --> 38:53.831
Ho ho ho, everyone.

38:56.292 --> 38:57.251
Prepare the sleigh.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.796
I have very important events
to attend to tonight. So...

39:02.757 --> 39:04.550
I see Santa's underpants.

39:10.723 --> 39:12.308
Cover your eyes.

39:14.310 --> 39:15.269
Chop-chop.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.188
Okay.

39:22.234 --> 39:25.029
Auntie Lou, can I ask you something?

39:25.112 --> 39:28.324
You could talk to me about anything.
That's what aunties are for.

39:28.657 --> 39:31.410
Let's just pretend I have this friend

39:31.577 --> 39:35.539
that desperately wants
to go for a joyride in Santa's sleigh.

39:35.623 --> 39:39.126
And you're worried that this friend
might get you on the naughty list?

39:39.543 --> 39:41.754
- Maybe.
- Okay, girls.

39:41.837 --> 39:44.256
- You can chitchat later. It's time to go.
- Okay.

39:46.592 --> 39:48.427
- Volume.
- Yeah, so...

39:50.513 --> 39:51.931
Look at our little pros.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.517
We're not rushing them into this, right?

39:54.600 --> 39:57.103
No, they know they can talk to us
about anything.

39:57.478 --> 39:58.437
We're cool parents.

39:59.772 --> 40:01.774
Look alive, pups. This is the real deal.

40:01.857 --> 40:04.568
I need to know that I can trust you
to behave tonight.

40:05.027 --> 40:08.697
Uncle Shep, we would never do anything
to make your job harder.

40:09.115 --> 40:11.242
Besides, it's my debut.

40:11.492 --> 40:13.869
You say "bark," we say "how loud?"

40:13.953 --> 40:16.664
Thanks for being such a stellar dogfather.
Heh.

40:17.164 --> 40:18.874
- Oh...
- Don't patronize me

40:18.958 --> 40:21.085
- with your highty-tighty slang.
- Calm down.

40:21.502 --> 40:24.171
By the smell of you, I'd say,
they put the antlers on the wrong end.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.465
That's it. You're a prima donna, mon.

40:26.757 --> 40:28.968
I challenge you to a joust.
You blabbermouth.

40:29.051 --> 40:30.678
I am so gonna mop you up,

40:30.761 --> 40:33.722
- just like the mop-head you are.
- Whoa. Whoa, okay?

40:33.806 --> 40:35.683
Show me your moves, you ragamuffin.

40:35.766 --> 40:37.101
Be forewarned.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.562
I was varsity fencing at Dartmouth.

40:39.645 --> 40:40.479
Shep.

40:41.021 --> 40:43.441
Okay. Sit, stay, don't move a muscle.

40:43.816 --> 40:45.192
Shep to the rescue.

40:46.110 --> 40:48.028
Okay, eyes off target.

40:48.320 --> 40:51.907
You know the plan. Santa's sweet ride
will be on the roof waiting for us.

40:52.032 --> 40:55.661
Time to ditch the Shep dog.

40:55.744 --> 40:57.538
No, I object.

40:57.621 --> 40:59.457
Whoa, harsh, Cindy.

40:59.540 --> 41:02.001
All in favor of ignoring Cindy?

41:02.334 --> 41:03.294
Aye.

41:03.377 --> 41:05.588
Sorry, Cindy, majority rules.

41:14.054 --> 41:15.764
Somebody tell me
they have eyes on the pups.

41:17.057 --> 41:17.892
Nobody?

41:18.434 --> 41:20.895
Charlie. Rosie. Brody. Cindy.

41:26.358 --> 41:27.776
Where did you get that suit?

41:28.235 --> 41:31.280
Turns out the little guys are great
with a needle and thread.

41:31.697 --> 41:33.824
Who would've thunk it? You likey?

41:35.910 --> 41:36.744
Yeah.

41:37.912 --> 41:40.456
Time to get down to business. Ahem.

41:49.882 --> 41:53.093
Elon, this sleigh is filthy.
Please, clean it.

41:55.721 --> 41:56.555
Thank you.

42:01.519 --> 42:03.437
Prancer, light on those hooves.

42:03.521 --> 42:06.023
I'm Prancer, and he's Dancer.

42:06.148 --> 42:08.484
Oh. Right. I knew that.

42:09.902 --> 42:10.736
Uh...

42:11.529 --> 42:12.947
What's the difference again?

42:15.074 --> 42:16.408
Very smooth.

42:16.867 --> 42:18.536
Yeah, I don't do that.

42:20.621 --> 42:22.915
New Santa is quite the hipster.

42:23.374 --> 42:24.375
Timber.

42:25.918 --> 42:27.419
Looking foxy, Vixen.

42:30.089 --> 42:30.923
Are you...?

42:31.006 --> 42:33.676
Are you playing reindeer games with me,
Cupid?

42:33.759 --> 42:37.304
No, I just have resting loving eyes.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.516
Oh, yeah. Cupid.

42:41.600 --> 42:42.476
That makes sense.

42:45.813 --> 42:48.148
Could someone bring Santa a strudel?

42:48.524 --> 42:49.984
You look too skinny.

42:50.651 --> 42:51.819
Nice pecs, Blitzen.

42:52.319 --> 42:54.905
You're doing most
of the heavy lifting around here?

42:54.989 --> 42:56.907
Danke, I work out.

42:57.241 --> 42:59.702
And I take it you're the pilot, flyboy?

43:00.369 --> 43:02.079
It's Comet, Santa.

43:03.247 --> 43:05.666
That is enough insubordination
out of you, fella.

43:06.417 --> 43:08.752
I am Santa, and what I say goes.

43:09.211 --> 43:11.839
I have a friend
who knows this reindeer named Rudy,

43:11.922 --> 43:13.924
and he would be happy to take your job.

43:14.466 --> 43:16.760
So, think about that.

43:19.013 --> 43:20.472
What a jabroni.

43:24.476 --> 43:26.895
What was that?
I couldn't quite hear you, son.

43:27.396 --> 43:29.982
Uh, I said, I like pepperoni, sir.

43:30.816 --> 43:31.650
So do I.

43:32.818 --> 43:33.652
So do I.

43:39.783 --> 43:40.618
Thank you.

43:44.663 --> 43:48.834
Okay, just hold the reins loosely,
and the reindeer will do the rest.

43:50.002 --> 43:52.838
I think I can handle it.
I flew a helicopter once.

43:54.381 --> 43:55.424
Sort of.

43:56.008 --> 43:57.384
Jiminy Christmas.

43:59.720 --> 44:02.514
Oh, no, you didn't just slap my heinie.

44:03.015 --> 44:03.849
Giddyap.

44:05.142 --> 44:06.352
Ho ho ho!

44:09.938 --> 44:13.192
- See? I'm a natural.
- What do you want, a trophy?

44:13.275 --> 44:16.820
- Hope you are not a nervous flyer.
- Let's give him a shock.

44:22.451 --> 44:24.995
And I got a need...

44:25.162 --> 44:25.996
for speed.

44:26.789 --> 44:29.625
Here comes the sonic boom, ja?

44:33.962 --> 44:36.507
Merry Christmas,
boys and girls, pups and pupettes,

44:36.590 --> 44:39.593
and welcome
to the Pup Star Christmas Special.

44:39.718 --> 44:42.846
- Oh. I love Christmas specials.
- Tonight we have...

44:42.930 --> 44:47.893
I used to watch them with mi familia,
when I was bien chico.

44:48.686 --> 44:49.520
We remember.

44:49.978 --> 44:51.897
You were on the nice list back then.

44:52.564 --> 44:54.942
So kind and caring.

44:55.484 --> 44:57.403
Ah... Things change.

44:58.779 --> 44:59.613
It's starting.

45:00.155 --> 45:00.989
All right, Tiny.

45:01.115 --> 45:04.326
Here we are at the North Pole,
doing our first Christmas special.

45:04.410 --> 45:05.411
I'm so excited.

45:05.744 --> 45:08.372
Christmas is my favorite time of the year.

45:14.753 --> 45:16.922
Here we go, guys. Coming in for a landing.

45:27.391 --> 45:30.352
Nice flying, ace. You're a natural.

45:32.312 --> 45:37.568
Everyone, duck for cover. He's going
to spill his cookies.

45:39.528 --> 45:41.738
Spin counterclockwise. It always helps me.

45:42.156 --> 45:43.866
Whoa!

45:44.199 --> 45:49.496
You know, venison is a delicacy
where I come from.

45:51.123 --> 45:52.541
Thanks for the ride, fellas.

45:53.208 --> 45:54.209
We'll be right back.

45:54.626 --> 45:57.254
You guys just sit here and uh...

45:58.338 --> 45:59.173
spin.

46:04.136 --> 46:05.512
There you go. After you.

46:08.056 --> 46:08.891
Okay.

46:10.601 --> 46:13.061
They've gotta be here somewhere.
Keep looking.

46:13.145 --> 46:14.897
Oh! Mr. Claus.

46:15.939 --> 46:18.817
It is such an honor
to have you on our show.

46:20.360 --> 46:21.278
All right already.

46:22.196 --> 46:23.155
No need to slobber.

46:24.740 --> 46:26.658
Well, let's get this show on the road.

46:26.742 --> 46:30.370
Santa's a very busy man this time of year,
as I'm sure you understand.

46:30.454 --> 46:32.873
Yes. Yes, of course. Right this way.

46:35.834 --> 46:36.668
You.

46:36.793 --> 46:38.504
Get lost.

46:42.216 --> 46:44.843
I've got some last-minute changes
for Santa's number.

46:47.429 --> 46:48.764
Five more minutes.

46:48.847 --> 46:51.266
Step, step, turn-step, jazz-hooves.

46:52.935 --> 46:54.811
This better be worth it.

46:55.145 --> 46:57.856
This is my debut we're missing, remember?

46:57.940 --> 46:58.774
Relax, sis.

46:59.149 --> 47:02.736
With all the loot we're gonna get,
you can buy your way into showbiz.

47:02.819 --> 47:05.906
Vixen, you are cray-cray like a fox.

47:08.116 --> 47:11.370
So many dancing sugarplums.

47:11.954 --> 47:13.956
For the record, this is a bad--

47:14.039 --> 47:16.458
I mean, worst idea ever.

47:17.167 --> 47:19.795
Get wise, Cindy.
We're only here to meet Santa.

47:25.259 --> 47:26.468
Guess who. Tag.

47:35.394 --> 47:38.105
Man, look at us.
Meeting Santa for some carols?

47:38.188 --> 47:39.982
Hope he's got a solid track,
locked and loaded.

47:40.649 --> 47:44.278
Trust me, this one's a showstopper.

49:14.743 --> 49:16.161
Here, I got it. I got it.

49:26.922 --> 49:27.964
They're not in there.

49:28.048 --> 49:30.092
Oh, no. This can't be happening.

49:30.175 --> 49:31.718
Where could our pups be?

49:32.928 --> 49:34.054
This way.

49:36.556 --> 49:41.311
Wait. This... is a bit of a surprise, no?

49:41.853 --> 49:45.565
Yes. A shocking and appalling surprise.

49:45.691 --> 49:48.235
Whee!

49:49.486 --> 49:50.696
You're on fire.

49:51.738 --> 49:52.739
I know.

49:52.989 --> 49:55.909
The audience loved me.
They really loved me.

49:56.410 --> 49:58.245
No, you're literally on fire.

49:58.370 --> 49:59.246
Huh?

50:00.372 --> 50:01.373
What--? What you--?

50:07.754 --> 50:11.174
Move it, bozo. We don't wanna be here
when the canine cops show up.

50:19.850 --> 50:20.726
Ow!

50:22.477 --> 50:23.520
Mush.

50:25.856 --> 50:27.649
We have liftoff, pups.

50:34.239 --> 50:36.158
- I'm sorry, Tiny.
- Did you find them?

50:36.700 --> 50:37.701
They've disappeared.

50:37.993 --> 50:40.996
They're not in Costumes,
not in the green room, not anywhere.

50:41.329 --> 50:43.623
- Nothing?
- Yo, no stone unturned.

50:44.374 --> 50:46.501
Don't worry, I promise, we will find them.

50:47.169 --> 50:48.962
We're horrible parents.

50:49.254 --> 50:51.089
I'll never forgive myself.

50:55.844 --> 50:57.888
Whoa, aurora borealis.

50:57.971 --> 51:00.599
It's just as beautiful as I imagined.

51:03.226 --> 51:04.060
Pay dirt.

51:04.311 --> 51:06.104
In you go, in you go. Yeah.

51:12.569 --> 51:14.279
So long, old Christmas.

51:14.571 --> 51:18.867
This is the season for giving to us.

51:18.950 --> 51:21.369
I can finally buy that luxury eye patch.

51:21.620 --> 51:23.830
Real velour. Oh, yeah.

51:26.291 --> 51:28.543
Everybody, be cool. Try to blend in.

51:36.593 --> 51:39.763
I thought the North Pole
was the happiest place on earth.

51:39.888 --> 51:43.016
Er, no, that's Disneyland.

51:45.101 --> 51:46.520
Don't be so judgy, sis.

51:46.812 --> 51:48.897
Elves are busy with tons of toys to make.

51:49.397 --> 51:50.774

53:39.382 --> 53:41.051
Please, help us find our puppies.

53:41.468 --> 53:44.137
Christmas isn't Christmas
without our family together.

53:44.220 --> 53:46.222
Rosie loves singing and dancing.

53:46.306 --> 53:48.350
And Charlie's as smart as a whip.

53:48.725 --> 53:51.394
Brody's a straight-up rascal,
loves an adventure.

53:51.811 --> 53:54.689
And Cindy is kind,
and caring, and soulful.

53:56.191 --> 53:57.609
Christmas was--

53:57.692 --> 54:00.111
I mean, is her perfect holiday.

54:00.487 --> 54:03.615
We don't know if they're lost,
or this is a prank, or whatever.

54:03.907 --> 54:05.784
We just want them home for Christmas.

54:05.867 --> 54:08.119
We're offering a reward
for their safe return.

54:08.244 --> 54:09.746
No questions asked.

54:10.372 --> 54:13.541
What kind of monster would do this?

54:14.918 --> 54:15.752
Sorry.

54:22.050 --> 54:23.635
Ho ho ho.

54:23.843 --> 54:25.929
If you want toys, toys, toys,

54:26.304 --> 54:30.141
go online,
and click, click, click SantaClaus.pole.

54:30.225 --> 54:33.561
And remember,
if your parents don't buy from Santa,

54:34.354 --> 54:35.730
they don't love you.

54:36.731 --> 54:38.441
I think I know where the pups are.

54:39.275 --> 54:40.110
What?

54:48.952 --> 54:51.955
Gentlemen, we're now
the most profitable business in history.

54:52.372 --> 54:55.709
From now on we charge for shipping.

54:56.126 --> 54:57.419
Whoa, hold the phone.

54:57.502 --> 54:59.379
Santa's charging us now?

54:59.462 --> 55:00.839
This is outrageous.

55:01.047 --> 55:04.300
I mean, what's even the point
of being a good pup all year?

55:06.469 --> 55:07.554
Who stole your puppy?

55:08.138 --> 55:10.306
Don't you think
I should have Santa's chair?

55:10.390 --> 55:13.226
I mean, I am the new Santa Claus.

55:13.309 --> 55:14.310
You're not Santa.

55:14.394 --> 55:17.313
Think of yourself as the Ronald McDonald
of the North Pole.

55:18.106 --> 55:19.649
What, you mean like a mascot?

55:19.941 --> 55:22.444
And the last horse
crosses the finish line.

55:23.153 --> 55:24.320
Okay, you stay here.

55:24.487 --> 55:26.823
Kano and I are going
to check in on our guests.

55:37.000 --> 55:38.293
Right, look alive, elves.

55:38.376 --> 55:39.377
Time is money.

55:40.211 --> 55:42.047
Candy doesn't grow on trees.

55:44.215 --> 55:45.050
Or does it?

55:46.301 --> 55:47.802
Eli, look into that.

55:51.723 --> 55:52.640
Here's our chance.

55:52.891 --> 55:56.394
Santa's alone, we go in,
state our case for more loot--

55:56.478 --> 55:57.437
And fame.

55:57.562 --> 56:00.398
Then I drive the sleigh home, as agreed.

56:01.524 --> 56:02.358
Come on.

56:02.859 --> 56:04.152
Something isn't right.

56:04.319 --> 56:07.322
Santa isn't this mean
and selfish in the book.

56:08.198 --> 56:11.910
Seriously, sis,
you can't believe everything you read.

56:12.702 --> 56:14.162
Think of it like a movie.

56:14.579 --> 56:15.789
Based on a true story,

56:15.872 --> 56:18.750
but with embellishments
to make it more interesting.

56:19.125 --> 56:23.671
Like Santa not being crazy, and sweaty,
and a total sugar junkie.

56:24.255 --> 56:26.800
- All in favor, say "aye."
- Aye.

56:26.883 --> 56:29.469
Nay, nope, nada.

56:29.761 --> 56:31.679
Democracy. It just works.

56:34.474 --> 56:35.475
Mr. Claus, sir.

56:37.060 --> 56:39.896
We're here to negotiate the terms
of our Christmas demands.

56:40.688 --> 56:42.107
How'd you guys get in here?

56:42.190 --> 56:43.691
We stowed away in your sleigh.

56:43.775 --> 56:45.985
Sweet ride, by the way. Totally cherry.

56:46.361 --> 56:49.072
And the "stowed away" thing
shouldn't count against us,

56:49.197 --> 56:52.826
since you stole my limelight at the show.

56:53.201 --> 56:58.081
Let me apologize in advance
for my brother and sisters.

56:58.498 --> 57:02.836
They're a little confused
about the true meaning of Christmas.

57:03.128 --> 57:05.255
But they have good hearts, honest.

57:05.880 --> 57:10.093
Uh... Santa's having a little bit
of a senior moment, kids.

57:11.177 --> 57:12.345
Who exactly are you?

57:12.762 --> 57:14.597
I'm Brody. You can call me Bro.

57:14.889 --> 57:15.723
I'm Charlie.

57:16.141 --> 57:18.476
Rosie, obviously.

57:18.560 --> 57:20.854
And I'm Cindy, Mr. Santa, sir.

57:21.271 --> 57:25.191
Not to name drop,
but our mom is Tiny, and our pop is P.U.P.

57:26.025 --> 57:27.485
Ding-dong? Ring a bell?

57:27.819 --> 57:29.112
Kind of a big deal.

57:29.779 --> 57:34.576
Oh, well, I'm sure we can
work something out.

57:34.659 --> 57:36.327
Whoa, yeah.

57:38.246 --> 57:39.664
Did I miss the punch line?

57:40.248 --> 57:41.082
Ho ho ho.

57:42.917 --> 57:46.379
Cindy was trying to tell us
that the puppies were up to something big.

57:47.088 --> 57:51.217
And how is being on the roof going
to help us find the puppies?

57:51.301 --> 57:52.135
Don't you see?

57:52.510 --> 57:56.014
Santa, he landed his sleigh here,
right before the puppies disappeared.

57:57.056 --> 57:58.892
Lou, you're a genius.

57:59.726 --> 58:02.061
Everybody, scour the roof for clues.

58:11.029 --> 58:12.197
Tastes like toothpaste.

58:13.490 --> 58:15.658
I think that's North Pole reindeer poop.

58:17.660 --> 58:19.454
It looks like Cindy left us a clue.

58:20.914 --> 58:22.957
The puppies are in the North Pole.

58:23.708 --> 58:26.252
Let's go.

58:29.047 --> 58:29.881
Let's go.

58:31.549 --> 58:33.718
A Tony for humble Julio?

58:33.801 --> 58:35.053
Of course.

58:36.346 --> 58:38.765
The king of Broadway, you say?

58:41.768 --> 58:44.354
At this rate,
there won't be enough Christmas spirit

58:44.437 --> 58:45.939
to power a piece of tinsel.

58:46.314 --> 58:47.607
We have to do something.

58:51.694 --> 58:53.446
Honey, we're home.

58:55.782 --> 58:57.033
Wake up, short stack.

58:57.116 --> 58:59.327
- What was that?
- You're supposed to stand guard.

59:00.745 --> 59:03.665
I mean... I was, Kano.

59:03.748 --> 59:09.837
It was a tricky trick I played,
to see if they try to escape, heh, heh.

59:09.921 --> 59:12.423
Never going to happen on Julio's watch.

59:12.507 --> 59:17.345
Not that you asked, but we're on track
for the most profitable Christmas yet.

59:18.012 --> 59:19.847
I've got that workshop humming.

59:20.306 --> 59:24.060
What you're doing, Bark,
is destroying the spirit of Christmas.

59:24.769 --> 59:27.188
Oh, look at the Christmas naughty list.

59:27.522 --> 59:29.190
It's out of control.

59:29.274 --> 59:32.318
The only ledger I care about
is my accounts ledger,

59:32.402 --> 59:33.987
and it's also growing.

59:34.070 --> 59:35.905
Profits are skyrocketing.

59:36.531 --> 59:38.783
Ka-ching, ka-ching.

59:39.075 --> 59:39.951
Hey.

59:40.785 --> 59:42.579
Look what I found.

59:43.204 --> 59:46.332
I told you, no mascots in Santa's cottage.

59:46.416 --> 59:48.376
Executive staff only.

59:48.459 --> 59:51.504
Excuse me? Who are you calling a mascot?

59:51.588 --> 59:52.422
Oh, okay.

59:52.505 --> 59:56.843
Well, I guess I'll just send Tiny
and P.U.P.'s adorable little pups

59:56.926 --> 59:58.386
- back home.
- What the...?

59:58.803 --> 01:00:00.597
You did-- But-- How did...?

01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:01.764
Roland.

01:00:06.519 --> 01:00:09.772
Anyone else find it odd
there's two Santas?

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.317
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

01:00:17.488 --> 01:00:19.532
- Who are those guys?
- She looks familiar.

01:00:21.242 --> 01:00:22.535
Tickets, please.

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:23.995
Tickets, please.

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.831
Why is everyone staring at us?

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:31.544
Maybe it's because you're dressed up
as Mrs. Claus.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:32.879
- Elvin.
- Incognito.

01:00:33.379 --> 01:00:34.339
- Tickets.
- There.

01:00:35.256 --> 01:00:37.592
- I want to look good for Santa.
- How you doing?

01:00:37.675 --> 01:00:40.345
This was the only costume
in the wardrobe that fit me.

01:00:41.429 --> 01:00:42.347
How have you been?

01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:44.307
Shh! He's coming.

01:00:44.849 --> 01:00:46.351
Act normal.

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:50.396
Hello. Tickets, please.

01:00:52.231 --> 01:00:54.192
Oh.

01:00:54.275 --> 01:00:55.902
It was just here.

01:00:56.027 --> 01:01:00.573
Um, I must have left it
in my other pointy hat.

01:01:03.576 --> 01:01:05.453
Do you know who I think I am?

01:01:08.539 --> 01:01:09.707
Mrs. Claus.

01:01:11.084 --> 01:01:12.418
Latina sister?

01:01:16.756 --> 01:01:19.592
I will make sure there's
a little extra something for you

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.135
in your stocking this year.

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:23.262
Being an elf is a calling.

01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:26.474
We work for the love of Christmas,
not for money.

01:01:27.308 --> 01:01:28.768
And I'm pretty sure

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:30.853
Mrs. Claus doesn't have a Latina sister.

01:01:31.979 --> 01:01:35.566
Of course I'm her sister.

01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:37.819
Trust me. I think I'd know.

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:43.449
You can put our tickets
on the North Pole account.

01:01:43.574 --> 01:01:44.784
Mm-hm.

01:01:45.284 --> 01:01:46.786
Okay. You can go now.

01:01:46.869 --> 01:01:47.704
Bye-bye.

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:49.914
Tickets, please.

01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:51.958
Tickets.

01:02:00.591 --> 01:02:01.801
Mrs. Claus?

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:04.554
Did that turkey infraction put us
on the naughty list?

01:02:05.179 --> 01:02:09.851
No, dear. You're good puppies
that occasionally make mistakes.

01:02:09.934 --> 01:02:11.310
It's part of growing up.

01:02:11.936 --> 01:02:14.063
Good,
because we have some serious demands.

01:02:14.355 --> 01:02:15.606
I mean, requests.

01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:17.567
Assuming we escape, of course.

01:02:18.025 --> 01:02:20.570
I'm so glad you're the real Santa, Santa.

01:02:21.863 --> 01:02:23.489
I was starting to lose faith.

01:02:39.505 --> 01:02:41.215
Thanks for riding. Keep it moving.

01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:42.550
Keep it moving.

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.136
Come on. Thanks for riding.

01:02:46.387 --> 01:02:47.221
Have a good one.

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:49.682
Thank you for riding.

01:02:50.266 --> 01:02:51.476
Señorita Claus.

01:02:52.143 --> 01:02:53.311
Ooh!

01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:57.565
Excuse me,
where's the bus to the North Pole?

01:02:57.648 --> 01:03:01.778
The coach is where it always is,
and has been forever and a day.

01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:02.945
Right this way.

01:03:05.823 --> 01:03:07.033
- This way?
- That way.

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:07.992
Thank you.

01:03:08.075 --> 01:03:08.910
Have a good one.

01:03:09.535 --> 01:03:11.162
Adiós, Ms. Claus.

01:03:13.414 --> 01:03:14.248
Good to see you.

01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:18.586
And that's everyone.

01:03:19.045 --> 01:03:20.296
We're the only ones left.

01:03:20.421 --> 01:03:21.297
Huh.

01:03:27.011 --> 01:03:28.471
So, let me get this straight.

01:03:29.388 --> 01:03:30.932
You filed an MPR...

01:03:32.683 --> 01:03:33.768
a Missing Persons Report...

01:03:36.103 --> 01:03:38.397
- for four of your lost puppies.
- That's right.

01:03:38.856 --> 01:03:44.612
And now your daughter,
their show manager, and the puppies' nanny

01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:46.656
have suddenly gone missing.

01:03:46.739 --> 01:03:48.950
Officer, it's kind of an emergency.

01:03:49.951 --> 01:03:51.160
I'll get right on that.

01:03:51.744 --> 01:03:53.412
Ooh, it's the glazed...

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:57.917
Thank you for your time, officer.

01:04:00.753 --> 01:04:03.089
There has to be a logical explanation.

01:04:03.381 --> 01:04:06.175
If I know Lou,
she's already hot on their trail.

01:04:06.968 --> 01:04:07.802
I hope.

01:04:08.261 --> 01:04:11.931
Well, thank goodness Ida is with them,
wherever that is.

01:04:12.014 --> 01:04:12.849
Yeah, Tiny.

01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:14.350
Nobody messes with Ida.

01:04:16.519 --> 01:04:17.520
Finally.

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:22.441
Bark?

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:24.735
Hello from the North Pole.

01:04:24.819 --> 01:04:25.653
Go figure.

01:04:26.112 --> 01:04:27.780
This has your stench all over it.

01:04:28.114 --> 01:04:29.031
I should've known.

01:04:29.365 --> 01:04:31.701
Who else is crazy enough
to ruin Christmas?

01:04:32.159 --> 01:04:34.996
Look at it as a reboot, Christmas 2.0.

01:04:35.204 --> 01:04:38.374
But I didn't call to bicker about that.
I've already won.

01:04:38.583 --> 01:04:40.793
I'm calling because I have your pups.

01:04:41.502 --> 01:04:42.587
I knew you took them.

01:04:42.795 --> 01:04:45.172
Learn a new trick already,
you dirty dognapper.

01:04:45.256 --> 01:04:46.257
Au contraire.

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:48.092
That's the beauty of it.

01:04:48.467 --> 01:04:51.762
Seems some extra furry baggage snuck
into Santa's sleigh.

01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:53.139
You're lying.

01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:54.557
Our pups would never--

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:55.474
Am I?

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:59.228
Your pups came here,
because they wanted more, more, more.

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:00.938
Smart pups.

01:05:01.647 --> 01:05:02.773
Except little Cindy,

01:05:02.857 --> 01:05:06.193
who can't tell the difference
between fairy tales and reality.

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:09.196
Just when I thought you couldn't
sink any lower.

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:12.283
Skip the pleasantries.
Name your price already.

01:05:12.783 --> 01:05:14.368
Oh, you'll love this.

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:17.079
I want you
to put on your Christmas special again

01:05:17.371 --> 01:05:18.247
on Christmas Eve.

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:20.917
Why? So you can ruin it again?

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:24.670
So you can thank
your new official sponsor, me.

01:05:25.087 --> 01:05:27.465
Kano will send you the script.
Do my show right,

01:05:27.548 --> 01:05:29.967
your little trespassers
will be returned safely.

01:05:30.051 --> 01:05:31.177
Don't, and...

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:32.887
Well, c'est la vie.

01:05:33.387 --> 01:05:34.639
So, deal?

01:05:35.014 --> 01:05:37.141
Of course it is. I have your puppies.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.185
Happy Christmas.

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:44.565
I don't think we have another choice here.

01:05:44.649 --> 01:05:45.816
We have to do the show.

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:50.655
Here we go.

01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:54.033
Hyah, hyah, hyah! Whoa!

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:55.868
Whoa, whoa!

01:06:02.375 --> 01:06:03.793
Welcome to the North Pole.

01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:08.589
- This is it. Sneaky-sneaky. Okay.
- Come on. Okay, this way.

01:06:08.673 --> 01:06:09.840
Of course there is.

01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:11.384
- There it is.
- Is that it?

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:26.774
Hey.

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:30.444
Oh, no. Oh, no. Shep.

01:06:33.155 --> 01:06:33.990
You three.

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:37.576
Does he mean us?

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:39.453
Oh, for the love of Christmas.

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:41.706
Yes, you three.

01:06:42.206 --> 01:06:43.332
Get over here, pronto.

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:45.126
- Who?
- I guess he does mean us.

01:06:50.131 --> 01:06:50.965
Who are you?

01:06:51.799 --> 01:06:54.510
We are your new elf recruits, sir.

01:06:54.635 --> 01:06:55.886
Uh-huh.

01:06:56.512 --> 01:06:57.722
And who are you supposed to be?

01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:00.725
Mrs. Claus' long-lost Latina twin sister.

01:07:01.142 --> 01:07:02.393
Señora Claus.

01:07:03.394 --> 01:07:04.353
It's true.

01:07:04.854 --> 01:07:08.065
Well, since we're being honest,
let me tell you a secret.

01:07:08.149 --> 01:07:09.859
Oh, I love secrets. Okay.

01:07:13.612 --> 01:07:14.447
Plastic.

01:07:15.322 --> 01:07:16.991
Okay, fess up.

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:20.453
Look.
We're just trying to find our puppies.

01:07:20.911 --> 01:07:22.747
We think that Roland dognapped them.

01:07:23.414 --> 01:07:26.250
Yes. And take down that evil,
maniacal dog, Bark.

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:27.752
What's your plan?

01:07:30.629 --> 01:07:31.881
We actually have no plan.

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:34.008
Yeah.

01:07:34.091 --> 01:07:38.179
We didn't think we'd get this far,
so, we're kind of winging it.

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:41.766
- Okay. You want your pups back...
- Uh-huh.

01:07:42.183 --> 01:07:44.226
- and I want my workshop back.
- Uh-huh.

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:45.895
So, let's go and get Santa.

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:47.563
- Okay. Yes. Okay.
- Yes.

01:07:48.314 --> 01:07:49.899
We're gonna go meet Santa.

01:07:49.982 --> 01:07:50.900
Hey.

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:53.903
It's this way.

01:07:55.654 --> 01:07:56.489
Yes. Okay.

01:07:56.989 --> 01:07:58.365
- Yes, this way.
- Santa.

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:02.369
I think it was the 1970s, right here.

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:07.166
You're stress-eating, gordo.

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:10.628
If you don't like the way I eat,
you don't have to watch.

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:14.131
You know sugar is more addictive
than caffeine?

01:08:14.882 --> 01:08:16.091
You need discipline.

01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:18.260
I'm Santa. It's normal.

01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:22.555
Hey, so, do you guys know
if we're still getting gifts or...?

01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:28.187
Answer: Sometimes even good kids
don't get what they want.

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:29.688
Happy?

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:32.942
We have bigger problems, hombre.

01:08:33.317 --> 01:08:35.069
Enough. Enough already.

01:08:35.611 --> 01:08:39.323
Enough with the list of demands,
and the scams,

01:08:39.573 --> 01:08:42.033
and the endless need for attention.

01:08:42.493 --> 01:08:45.078
Whoa, sis. Let's not get crazy here.

01:08:45.246 --> 01:08:47.206
Some of us were born to be the star.

01:08:47.288 --> 01:08:49.457
And let's not throw out all the fun, okay?

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:54.671
Just because you're smarter, bigger,
and more talented doesn't make you right.

01:08:55.171 --> 01:08:58.384
Brody, it's time you took responsibility

01:08:58.466 --> 01:09:02.054
for all the chaos you've caused,
in the name of fun.

01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:04.974
I feel like the stupidest,
funnest brother ever.

01:09:05.307 --> 01:09:07.059
Rosie, newsflash.

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:08.769
It's not always about you.

01:09:08.853 --> 01:09:13.064
Cut to:
Rosie, feeling like a terrible sister.

01:09:13.524 --> 01:09:16.527
Charlie, things don't make you happy.
Period.

01:09:16.861 --> 01:09:19.697
I love you guys.
Even more than all of my stuff.

01:09:21.948 --> 01:09:24.368
You want some crackers with that cheese?

01:09:24.451 --> 01:09:25.703
Get real, pups.

01:09:26.495 --> 01:09:27.872
Look here.

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:29.790
You're right. There it is.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:33.127
You know, Roland,
when you were a little boy,

01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:35.045
you were on our nice list.

01:09:35.629 --> 01:09:36.881
In fact, our records show

01:09:36.964 --> 01:09:39.758
you got that train
you so kindly asked for.

01:09:41.385 --> 01:09:42.428
No, I didn't.

01:09:43.136 --> 01:09:45.598
You put coal in my stocking every year.

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:49.560
Roland, come take a look at our records.

01:10:15.169 --> 01:10:18.923
Here you go, Roland,
that train set that you always wanted.

01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:21.634
No, that's not true.

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:23.802
Oh...

01:10:36.315 --> 01:10:37.900
Guys. Santa came.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:38.984
Yeah. Yeah.

01:10:39.944 --> 01:10:41.570
- What'd you get?
- Coal.

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:43.656
I tried my hardest to be good.

01:10:44.448 --> 01:10:46.325
I'm giving up on Christmas.

01:11:05.052 --> 01:11:08.847
I'm so sorry that happened to you,
Mr. Roland.

01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:11.725
I don't care. It was a long time ago.

01:11:13.477 --> 01:11:16.313
You don't want
all those good little boys and girls

01:11:16.397 --> 01:11:18.357
to get coal in their stockings,

01:11:18.732 --> 01:11:21.735
just because their families can't
afford gifts, do you?

01:11:24.738 --> 01:11:26.407
No, no, no. Don't listen, Roland.

01:11:26.991 --> 01:11:27.825
He lies.

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:29.493
Sweet, sweet lies.

01:11:29.618 --> 01:11:30.536
Oh...

01:11:30.911 --> 01:11:31.996
Julio.

01:11:32.871 --> 01:11:36.959
You were the happiest pup in the junkyard,
before you lost your family.

01:11:38.502 --> 01:11:41.422
You stopped believing in Christmas
that day.

01:11:45.259 --> 01:11:47.886
Nobody tells Julio how Julio feels.

01:11:57.354 --> 01:11:58.314
Oh, no.

01:11:58.939 --> 01:12:01.400
The waterworks.

01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:09.867
These are sweet, sweet truths.

01:12:10.951 --> 01:12:12.786
We have a captive clientele,

01:12:13.412 --> 01:12:16.707
elves that work for candy,
and zero competition.

01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:19.626
It's time to raise prices.

01:12:19.710 --> 01:12:20.669
Genius.

01:12:20.878 --> 01:12:23.130
All we have to do now is deliver
on Christmas,

01:12:23.213 --> 01:12:25.549
and charge those parents' credit cards
into the ground.

01:12:25.632 --> 01:12:27.801
We're rich. Tiny's ruined.

01:12:28.469 --> 01:12:30.220
This must be what happy feels like.

01:12:31.305 --> 01:12:32.139
Okay.

01:12:35.225 --> 01:12:36.769
Oh, okay. Okay.

01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:44.860
Okay, here's the plan. Shep,
you're gonna bust down the front door.

01:12:45.235 --> 01:12:47.363
I'm not exactly the rough-and-tumble type.

01:12:47.446 --> 01:12:49.031
I got this.

01:12:56.121 --> 01:12:56.955
Oh!

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:59.375
Oh, impressive.

01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:01.335
Coming. I got it. I got it.

01:13:01.418 --> 01:13:03.796
All right. Elon,
you'll come down the chimney.

01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:05.297
I always wanted to do that.

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:07.383
- Good. Lou, you keep a watch out.
- Okay.

01:13:07.466 --> 01:13:10.135
All right, here's the thing.
I'm gonna go around back.

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.346
As soon as you hear the moose mating call,

01:13:12.429 --> 01:13:14.223
- we go in.
- Okay.

01:13:14.306 --> 01:13:16.433
- You'll know it when you hear it.
- Mm-hm.

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:17.559
Okay, go.

01:13:20.187 --> 01:13:21.021
Here we go.

01:13:21.313 --> 01:13:24.900
- Here we go.
- Quiet. We go sneaky-sneaky, okay?

01:13:29.655 --> 01:13:30.489
Ready, boss.

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:35.452
Bark and Kano only care about themselves.

01:13:36.203 --> 01:13:38.163
Their souls are as black as coal.

01:13:38.372 --> 01:13:41.583
Yes, but you both have love
in your hearts,

01:13:42.167 --> 01:13:45.754
which went dormant,
when you were hurt as little boys.

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:47.756
This...

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:50.426
This is why you're Santa Claus.

01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:53.846
Now we can get Christmas back on track.

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:00.519
What was that?

01:14:01.019 --> 01:14:02.271
Christmas chupacabra?

01:14:02.354 --> 01:14:04.356
It's not moose mating season.

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:18.537
Elf uprising.

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:19.663
Everybody, flee.

01:14:20.497 --> 01:14:21.540
Wha--?

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:24.835
Hey, quit it.

01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:26.628
Eli, what's going on here?

01:14:27.379 --> 01:14:29.840
- We're here to save you, boss.
- Whoa!

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:35.095
Props to you, SC.
It's harder than it looks.

01:14:37.014 --> 01:14:39.683
Good news, Eli. We're already saved.

01:14:39.766 --> 01:14:43.395
These nice pups and handsome Chihuahua...

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:46.273
And formerly misguided man-child.

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:49.359
They've seen the error in their ways.

01:14:53.530 --> 01:14:54.364
They're coming.

01:15:05.417 --> 01:15:06.460
Shh.

01:15:09.087 --> 01:15:10.714
Why am I not surprised?

01:15:11.089 --> 01:15:13.884
Just once, I'd like things to go smoothly.

01:15:18.805 --> 01:15:20.933
They're going. They're going.

01:15:22.851 --> 01:15:24.353
A gift? For me?

01:15:26.647 --> 01:15:28.148
Obviously I deserve it, but...

01:15:28.232 --> 01:15:30.692
what do you get
for the dog who owns the world?

01:15:33.111 --> 01:15:34.696
Uh-oh!

01:15:38.450 --> 01:15:39.618
What the...?

01:15:40.494 --> 01:15:42.663
Um, who are you?

01:15:42.746 --> 01:15:44.122
I'm the puppies' nanny.

01:15:44.414 --> 01:15:47.501
And I'm their manager,
slash publicist, slash dogfather.

01:15:47.751 --> 01:15:49.378
And I'm their Auntie Lou.

01:15:49.461 --> 01:15:51.922
I knew you'd come, Aunt Lou.

01:15:52.381 --> 01:15:53.924
That's what aunties are for.

01:15:54.258 --> 01:15:56.260
Do something, you half-wits.

01:15:56.343 --> 01:16:00.681
Sticks and stones may break my bones,
but your names bounce off of Julio.

01:16:01.056 --> 01:16:04.601
We hereby officially resign
from the Mean Team.

01:16:04.893 --> 01:16:06.478
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:09.898
Roland, don't do this.
Think about the good times. Like...

01:16:13.068 --> 01:16:16.071
Bark, you are a perro muy malo.

01:16:16.488 --> 01:16:18.865
Time we take back the North Pole,

01:16:19.366 --> 01:16:23.161
and show the world
the true meaning of Christmas.

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:25.956
Later, dog breath.

01:16:26.039 --> 01:16:29.543
Say, you guys wouldn't
mind us rerouting all your swag

01:16:29.626 --> 01:16:32.004
to good kids and puppies in need,
would you?

01:16:32.504 --> 01:16:34.006
Take a picture of them, Elon.

01:16:36.925 --> 01:16:38.385
You'll be insta-losers.

01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:40.804
You won't be able to buy a follower.

01:16:47.853 --> 01:16:50.022
And if I were you, I'd stay in that jail.

01:16:50.897 --> 01:16:53.859
There's a lot of angry elves out there
with low blood sugar.

01:16:57.571 --> 01:16:58.905
Foolproof, you said.

01:16:58.989 --> 01:17:00.407
So, who's the fool?

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.706
I just put the suit on,
and I'm sweating like crazy.

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:09.458
Are you sure this is necessary?

01:17:09.541 --> 01:17:12.628
I'm more of a "behind the scenes"
kind of guy, you know?

01:17:13.045 --> 01:17:15.130
- Are we really doing this, T?
- Yes.

01:17:15.255 --> 01:17:16.715
And in spite of Bark,

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:20.010
we are going
to put on the best Christmas show ever.

01:17:20.093 --> 01:17:21.970
People need their spirits lifted,

01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:23.680
and we need to show Bark

01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:26.266
that he can't put a price tag
on Christmas spirit.

01:17:29.269 --> 01:17:30.312
Let's do this.

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:35.651
Ladies and gents, pups and puppettes,
on this Christmas Eve,

01:17:37.027 --> 01:17:41.490
the Santa Claus Corporation is proud
to bring you

01:17:41.573 --> 01:17:43.367
the Pup Star Christmas Special.

01:17:43.825 --> 01:17:48.121
Tiny, P.U.P., and we hope their puppies,
will bring Christmas cheer to one and all

01:17:48.413 --> 01:17:50.332
at no extra cost.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:55.796

I'll be back in a North Pole minute.

01:19:36.396 --> 01:19:39.691
I'm sorry there's no room for you four
in the sleigh.

01:19:40.192 --> 01:19:41.777
Oh, don't sweat it, Santa.

01:19:41.902 --> 01:19:43.779
We'll hold down the North Pole
till you get back.

01:19:44.404 --> 01:19:46.114
Ooh!

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:51.119
And now it's time to fly good tidings

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:53.997
to all the good little pups and kids
all over the world.

01:19:55.499 --> 01:19:58.043
Let's spread some Christmas cheer.

01:19:59.669 --> 01:20:05.300
But, Brody, I sure could use a copilot
to help me fly this sleigh.

01:20:05.383 --> 01:20:06.426
It's all happening.

01:20:06.718 --> 01:20:08.053
My vision board came true.

01:20:08.386 --> 01:20:10.013
I will not let you down, Santa.

01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:12.682
We'll be tracking your progress, sir.

01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:16.436
It's good to have you back.

01:20:18.563 --> 01:20:21.608
Glad to be flying
with the good guys again, SC.

01:20:22.359 --> 01:20:23.902
Let's get a move on, now.

01:20:23.985 --> 01:20:25.821
I'm ready to move and groove.

01:20:26.196 --> 01:20:28.281
We've got a Christmas to save.

01:20:29.282 --> 01:20:34.371
On Dancer, on Prancer, on Cupid, on Vixen,

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:37.165
on Comet, on Blitzen.

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:39.793
- Bye, Santa.
- Bye.

01:20:39.876 --> 01:20:41.461
Merry Christmas, Santa.

Come on. Oh, yeah.

01:20:55.392 --> 01:20:58.812
I gotta say,
this Christmas kind of went off the rails.

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:03.275
I just really hope Santa brought our wish.

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:04.734

01:21:05.193 --> 01:21:06.027
Is this...?

01:21:06.736 --> 01:21:08.864
Can somebody please tell me
what my cue is?

01:21:10.198 --> 01:21:12.117
Actually, I think that's my cue.

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:32.989

You're welcome, world.

01:22:46.753 --> 01:22:47.837
I found Santa.

It was so crazy. I drove the sleigh.

01:22:55.261 --> 01:22:57.597
And Santa said
I could come back every year.

01:22:57.681 --> 01:23:00.600
Oh, you'll have to excuse me, friends,

01:23:01.142 --> 01:23:03.770
but I'm a wee bit behind schedule
this year.

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:07.649
