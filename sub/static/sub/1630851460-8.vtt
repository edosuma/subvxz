Brittany, open this door.
Open this door right now!

17:22.767 --> 17:24.191
BRITTANY:
Guys, guys.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.769
I locked him up.
We're free.

17:26.788 --> 17:28.120
I locked Wayne
in the stairwell.

17:28.197 --> 17:30.548
-Oh, thank God.
-We need a beer run.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.957
ALL: Yes!

17:32.034 --> 17:34.260
-Can I come?
-Uh, no.

17:37.782 --> 17:39.115
-Hey, yo.
-Nick.

17:39.133 --> 17:42.209
Boss man, we need the show
credit card, stat.

17:42.287 --> 17:43.544
What show credit card?

17:43.563 --> 17:45.045
Come on, we know
there's a show credit card.

17:45.123 --> 17:46.213
Yo, we need beer and tequila.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.565
You guys looking to form
a boy band?

17:47.642 --> 17:49.475
-Where's Wayne?
-He gave us his blessing.

17:49.627 --> 17:51.477
Booze is actually
a pretty good idea.

17:51.554 --> 17:53.129
I don't why I didn't think
about it myself.

17:53.131 --> 17:54.463
All right, just keep it
under a grand, yeah?

17:54.482 --> 17:57.224
Whoa, metal credit cards
are a real thing?

17:57.243 --> 17:58.317
The sucker's got heft, huh?

17:58.469 --> 18:00.703
-Is it giving you back problems?
-Just go.

18:04.659 --> 18:07.143
Julia, hey.

18:07.161 --> 18:08.661
Oh, hey, Linus.

18:08.813 --> 18:09.829
How'd you get out?

18:09.981 --> 18:11.923
Oh, well,
there was a prison riot.

18:12.074 --> 18:13.332
It's unbelievable.

18:13.484 --> 18:16.152
Brief reprieve.
Fresh air.

18:16.154 --> 18:17.911
Apple? It's gluten-free.

18:17.989 --> 18:20.489
What is your deal?
What are you, undercover?

18:20.491 --> 18:23.159
Part of the tall,
handsome Australian bureau

18:23.177 --> 18:26.162
that knows and remembers
everyone's food allergies?

18:26.180 --> 18:27.438
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You got me.

18:27.515 --> 18:29.165
I asked to go undercover
in Detroit

18:29.183 --> 18:30.608
as a union sound guy.

18:30.685 --> 18:31.943
I knew it. So onto you.

18:33.004 --> 18:34.278
Same goes for you.
What's your story?

18:34.355 --> 18:35.521
What?

18:35.673 --> 18:38.932
You're this hot blonde dancer
with a great laugh

18:38.952 --> 18:40.934

-Yes.

18:43.606 --> 18:46.182

-Julia, the brownie.

18:46.184 --> 18:47.274

a guitar from you?

18:48.369 --> 18:50.353

I need another guitar?

18:50.371 --> 18:51.462
I have ten.

18:51.614 --> 18:53.464
I mean, jeez,

18:53.466 --> 18:54.690

Actually, don't.

18:54.692 --> 18:55.541
BOTH: No, no, no.

18:55.635 --> 18:56.968

but I'm a horror show.

18:57.044 --> 18:59.119

Come on, come on, come on.

18:59.197 --> 19:00.880

I am.

19:01.032 --> 19:02.198
-Oh, boy.
-Come on, let's go.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.382

embarrassing enough.

19:03.534 --> 19:04.625
Uh-huh.

19:04.702 --> 19:06.051
You really have ten guitars?

19:06.128 --> 19:07.979

19:08.055 --> 19:09.647

19:09.798 --> 19:11.465
-All of it.
-Good answer.

19:11.542 --> 19:13.376
Okay, have ever told you
how much I love you?

19:13.469 --> 19:14.801
Aw.

19:14.879 --> 19:17.321

dance at the Pulver Center

20:24.057 --> 20:25.890
before COVID,
cookies never stopped them.

20:25.967 --> 20:27.892

where did you find that thing?

she used to dance to that song

26:12.313 --> 26:13.312

26:13.388 --> 26:15.555
Boy, you were so stubborn.

26:15.633 --> 26:17.149
She would just get you,

26:17.301 --> 26:20.560

these long dance parties.

26:20.580 --> 26:22.580
Just you and her, right
over there in that corner.

26:22.656 --> 26:25.249

I was a little bit jealous.

26:36.429 --> 26:37.744

with your brothers.

26:37.763 --> 26:39.412

26:39.432 --> 26:42.099

26:55.430 --> 26:57.430

of my life,

26:57.450 --> 26:59.675

love me back.

(both chuckling)

38:19.947 --> 38:22.190
How was the rest of your night?

38:22.192 --> 38:25.093
Oh, it was, uh, uneventful.

38:27.697 --> 38:29.213
Hello, Mr. Calgrove.

38:29.366 --> 38:30.882
I'm Monica Sullivan
from "The Big Leap."

38:31.034 --> 38:32.216
I heard you got injured
on the job.

38:32.369 --> 38:33.793
I brought subs and beer.

38:33.870 --> 38:35.812
Can I have a moment
of your time?

38:35.889 --> 38:37.797
Anybody with subs and beer.

38:37.874 --> 38:39.316
-Come on in.
-(chuckles)

38:41.302 --> 38:43.394
You do not know Idris Elba?

38:43.547 --> 38:44.562
I met him.

38:44.639 --> 38:46.489
I sat next to him
at an award show.

38:46.566 --> 38:48.232
Close talker.

38:48.309 --> 38:50.327
Sounds about right.

38:51.496 --> 38:54.722
So I wanted to speak to you
about Justin.

38:54.724 --> 38:56.583
Yeah, I figured.

38:57.819 --> 38:59.744
Your son is very special.

39:00.505 --> 39:02.672
-I'm not much for compliments.
-Me neither.

39:02.899 --> 39:04.716
Well, cheers to that.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.239
But Justin is truly talented.

39:11.241 --> 39:14.166
MONICA: When he dances, you
can't take your eyes off him.

39:14.244 --> 39:18.671
He's inspired me to think
about dance in a different way.

39:18.748 --> 39:21.249
When he left,
I...

39:21.267 --> 39:24.009
I told him he was replaceable.

39:24.029 --> 39:25.845
That was terrible,

39:25.864 --> 39:28.865
abut I can't replace him.

39:29.016 --> 39:30.367
I know that
he would love for you

39:30.443 --> 39:32.184
to see him dance in our show.

39:32.262 --> 39:34.687
And I want you to see him too.

39:34.764 --> 39:37.374
He's that good?

39:37.450 --> 39:38.875
He's precious.

39:39.026 --> 39:42.620
But I know that
he's precious to you too, so

39:42.772 --> 39:44.964
I'm here to see
if we can work something out.

39:48.202 --> 39:50.962
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but, Monica, I can't go back.

39:51.038 --> 39:52.097
I need to be here.

39:55.118 --> 39:56.284
MONICA:
What if someone else

39:56.377 --> 39:58.561
could help you
with the business?

39:58.713 --> 40:00.972
Mr. Calgrove...

40:01.124 --> 40:04.216
this is Joel,
Ellison, and Anthony.

40:04.294 --> 40:06.903
"The Big Leap" would be
delighted to pay them

40:07.130 --> 40:10.556
to work for you
during Justin's absence.

40:10.634 --> 40:12.075
(chuckling)

40:12.226 --> 40:15.912
I don't know what to say,
but, uh...

40:15.989 --> 40:19.082
I do know what
your mother would say.

40:19.233 --> 40:20.750
-Go.
-But, Dad--

40:20.827 --> 40:22.544
No, no, no, no, no.

40:24.147 --> 40:26.648
You boys know anything
about gutters?

40:26.650 --> 40:27.815
-Oh, yeah.
-It's our specialty.

40:27.909 --> 40:28.741
-Like the back of our hand.
-You kidding me?

40:28.760 --> 40:30.593
All I know is gutters.
