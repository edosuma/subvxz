But what he said tonight,
that was a big step for him.

01:22.500 --> 01:25.210
And it took him six months
to take it.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.710
And then you're leaning toward
this artist guy.

01:27.710 --> 01:29.620
-What's his name?
-Walker.

01:29.620 --> 01:31.120
Are you gonna see him again?

01:31.120 --> 01:33.380
Doubtful.
He didn't ask how to reach me,

01:33.380 --> 01:35.540
and he doesn't even know
my last name.

01:35.540 --> 01:37.960
Well, he could find that out
with a minimum of effort.

01:37.960 --> 01:40.500
As could you about him.
Just saying.
