WEBVTT

00:03.481 --> 00:05.918
The light down here
is really awful.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.529
Maybe you need reading glasses

00:07.616 --> 00:10.923
or you could learn to hold
a book with your feet.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.403
That I can do.

00:12.490 --> 00:16.146
The hard part's licking
my toes to turn the pages.

00:16.233 --> 00:18.757
Besides I-I told you
my eyes are fine.

00:18.844 --> 00:23.327
Well, at least turn
the book right-side up.

00:23.414 --> 00:24.328
What?

00:24.415 --> 00:25.982
[laughs]

00:26.069 --> 00:30.030
I made you look
'cause you can't see.

00:30.117 --> 00:34.208
Real funny. Books are stupid
anyway. What are you looking at?

00:34.295 --> 00:36.079
Oh, I was cleaning out
the laundry room

00:36.166 --> 00:38.255
and I found a bunch of
my mom's old sketch pads.

00:38.342 --> 00:40.823
Wow, I thought her only talent
was opening a bottle of wine

00:40.910 --> 00:42.781
with a chopstick
and a pair of pliers.

00:42.868 --> 00:45.697
Well, she could do
lots of stuff.

00:45.784 --> 00:49.005
As you know, she can put
her ankles behind her head.

00:49.092 --> 00:50.963
Yeah, she showed me
the second time I met her.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.617
I kept saying, "I believe you,
I believe you"

00:52.704 --> 00:55.620
but she already
had her shoes off.

00:55.707 --> 00:56.621
Yeah, I remember.

00:56.708 --> 00:57.622
That's why we can't go back

00:57.709 --> 01:00.712
to that Olive Garden.

01:00.799 --> 01:02.323
They-they're really good though.

01:02.410 --> 01:05.935
Right? I mean, her use
of color and shading.

01:06.022 --> 01:07.284
There's some real talent here.

01:07.371 --> 01:08.938
Yeah, very lifelike.

01:09.025 --> 01:11.114
Hey, look at the naked,
chubby guy

01:11.201 --> 01:12.594
with the bowl of fruit
in his lap.

01:12.681 --> 01:15.727
God! That's my dad,
and that wasn't a bowl of fruit.

01:15.814 --> 01:18.861
Please get some glasses!

[instrumental music]

01:39.751 --> 01:43.581
Oh, my God, these drawings
are really great.

01:43.668 --> 01:45.583
Right? I mean,
did you have any idea

01:45.670 --> 01:47.019
mom had this kind of talent?

01:47.107 --> 01:48.499
Not a clue.

01:48.586 --> 01:50.110
The most impressive thing
I've seen her do

01:50.197 --> 01:54.026
is spear a pickle out
of a jar using her tongue.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.159
The thing got my engagement
ring out of the drain.

01:56.246 --> 01:59.554
Her tongue is like
a Swiss Army knife.

01:59.641 --> 02:01.599
- Good morning.
- Hey, mom.

02:01.686 --> 02:03.514
Vin and I are heading
to Lincoln Park.

02:03.601 --> 02:05.603
He likes to sip espresso
and feed the ducks.

02:05.690 --> 02:07.257
Since I'm a kid.

02:07.344 --> 02:09.216
I can't get enough of our
fine feathered friends.

02:09.303 --> 02:12.001
Especially ducks and swans.
Any of your water fowl.

02:14.308 --> 02:17.398
There's this cock-eyed mallard
that, I swear to God

02:17.485 --> 02:18.834
thinks Vince is his mama.

02:18.921 --> 02:21.097
I call him Anthony.
He's so dear.

02:22.751 --> 02:24.405
Where'd you girls
dig that up from?

02:24.492 --> 02:27.321
In the basement. You know, mom,
these are really good.

02:27.408 --> 02:29.932
- Why'd you give it up?
- Two reasons.

02:30.019 --> 02:33.414
You and you.

02:33.501 --> 02:35.764
No time for that nonsense
when you're raising kids.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.157
Hey, l-let's hit it, doll.

02:37.244 --> 02:38.462
If we're late, Anthony worries

02:38.549 --> 02:40.464
and starts pecking
at his own ass.

02:43.511 --> 02:45.034
He loves those ducks.

02:45.121 --> 02:46.253
If it were up to me,
I'd just shoot them

02:46.340 --> 02:48.646
kebab them and add orange sauce.

02:50.344 --> 02:52.433
She gave all this up for us.

02:52.520 --> 02:55.697
That's so sad.

02:55.784 --> 02:58.613
Hey, is that daddy
holding a banana?

03:01.355 --> 03:03.052
Yes and no.

03:05.054 --> 03:06.403
[instrumental music]

03:08.362 --> 03:10.668
It certainly explains your
mom's resentment towards you

03:10.755 --> 03:12.844
but why's she always
giving me the stink eye?

03:12.931 --> 03:15.238
Well, some of that's
the toilet seat thing

03:15.325 --> 03:18.154
and after two years,
I can't say that I blame her.

03:18.241 --> 03:20.852
Well, at least I flush now.
I don't get any points for that?

03:20.939 --> 03:25.030
No, you're not gonna get points
for just not living like an ape.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.121
And when did this
become about me?

03:29.209 --> 03:30.906
I just don't want
to resent our kids

03:30.993 --> 03:34.083
because I didn't do all of
the things that I wanted to do.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.693
Well, you can't draw.

03:35.780 --> 03:37.086
The bells you drew
for our wedding invitation

03:37.173 --> 03:39.523
looked like two hams
taking a walk.

03:39.610 --> 03:41.786
That was a rough sketch
with a Magic Marker.

03:41.873 --> 03:43.701
Besides, I'm not talking
about drawing.

03:43.788 --> 03:45.964
Good, 'cause you can't draw.

03:46.051 --> 03:48.532
My point is..
I just..

03:48.619 --> 03:50.534
There's still things
that I want to do

03:50.621 --> 03:52.101
before we start a family.

03:52.188 --> 03:53.842
Is this about
shooting my gun again?

03:53.929 --> 03:55.409
'Cause going
to the range is one thing

03:55.496 --> 03:58.803
going to the dump
and picking off rats is another.

03:58.890 --> 04:02.720
I was half-drunk
and mostly kidding.

04:02.807 --> 04:04.592
You tried to take it
out of my holster.

04:04.679 --> 04:06.289
I was being flirty.

04:06.376 --> 04:09.031
Learn to pick up
on a signal, buddy.

04:09.118 --> 04:10.859
Sorry.

04:10.946 --> 04:12.687
So, are you flirting
with me now?

04:12.774 --> 04:15.080
No.

04:15.167 --> 04:18.562
I'm just saying
you must have certain goals

04:18.649 --> 04:19.694
that you still
want to accomplish

04:19.781 --> 04:21.304
before we start a family.

04:21.391 --> 04:24.916
Mm, married, flat-screen TV,
my own bowling ball.

04:25.003 --> 04:27.267
Nope, daddy done.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.834
Well, this old filly
still has a few races to run

04:29.921 --> 04:32.968
a couple of mountains to climb.

04:33.055 --> 04:34.796
Well, go for it.
Follow your dreams.

04:34.883 --> 04:37.146
And if your dreams take you
by a store, we need milk.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.933
Yeah, I know we do. You put the
empty carton back in the fridge.

04:42.020 --> 04:44.762
The trash can was full.

04:44.849 --> 04:47.330
We're gonna mix things up
while we still can.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.245
Well, what do you want to do?

04:49.332 --> 04:50.812
I...don't know.

04:50.899 --> 04:53.771
Something that
I've always wanted to do.

04:53.858 --> 04:57.775
[gasps]
We're gonna learn
to roller skate.

04:57.862 --> 05:00.474
I can't put down a toilet seat
or throw away a milk carton

05:00.561 --> 05:02.650
and you want
to put wheels on me?

- Here?
- No.

- Here?
- Back a little further.

05:12.442 --> 05:14.488
- Here?
- Okay, right there.

05:16.533 --> 05:19.057
Oh, they brought back
turkey sausage.

05:20.711 --> 05:22.626
Man, why do you even
look at this menu?

05:22.713 --> 05:24.889
You got it memorized, plus you
order the same thing every day.

05:24.976 --> 05:26.630
No, I don't.

05:26.717 --> 05:29.241
Denver omelet, three strips
of bacon and whole wheat toast.

05:29.329 --> 05:33.289
Denver omelet, three strips
of bacon and whole wheat toast.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.335
Already on the grill, buttercup.

05:35.422 --> 05:36.858
- For you?
- I'll have the same.

05:36.945 --> 05:38.686
Except make the bread white,
the bacon sausage

05:38.773 --> 05:40.731
and the eggs scrambled.

05:40.818 --> 05:42.820
Already on the grill.

05:45.649 --> 05:49.087
You get that one day
I'll snap, right?

05:49.174 --> 05:51.829
Oh, yeah, we got
a betting pool on it.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.701
Yeah, if you go postal between
Christmas and New Year's

05:53.788 --> 05:56.399
I'll split my winnings with you.

05:56.486 --> 05:58.358
Assuming you're
one of the survivors.

06:06.453 --> 06:09.151
Yeah, maybe
we are in kind of a rut.

06:09.238 --> 06:11.196
Yeah, I feel like I live
a pretty full life.

06:11.283 --> 06:12.981
I mean, I'm certainly
no risk taker.

06:13.068 --> 06:15.636
Mm. What about that time you sat
on the Styrofoam cooler

06:15.723 --> 06:19.814
at the police picnic?
That was daredevil behavior.

06:19.901 --> 06:22.599
I rolled the dice and I lost.

06:22.686 --> 06:24.993
No, everybody lost
and spent the whole day

06:25.080 --> 06:28.997
drinking warm beer
and eating flat hot dogs.

06:29.084 --> 06:32.043
The cooler looked like
an airplane crash sight.

06:32.130 --> 06:34.176
Well, I didn't hear anybody
complaining about my weight

06:34.263 --> 06:35.873
when I anchored the tug-of-war.

06:35.960 --> 06:38.746
Aw, nah. You certainly walked
away a hero that day.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.052
Even with the deviled eggs
stuck to your butt.

06:43.315 --> 06:46.623
You know, maybe I should try
mixing it up a little bit.

06:46.710 --> 06:48.712
Hey, I still have my trombone
from high school

06:48.799 --> 06:51.759
and I always wanted to form
my own Dixieland band.

06:51.846 --> 06:55.066
Well, to that idea,
may I just say, "No, Susanna."

06:57.895 --> 07:00.289
Scoff if you want, but Dixieland
is an underappreciated

07:00.376 --> 07:01.943
American art form.

07:02.030 --> 07:04.946
It used to be, but now it's
just bad jazz for white folks.

07:07.252 --> 07:09.690
Look, you never see Miles Davis
walking around in a straw hat

07:09.777 --> 07:13.084
wearing garters on his sleeves.

07:13.171 --> 07:14.825
That's true.
It's a hard look to pull off

07:14.912 --> 07:16.653
unless you're scooping ice cream
or picking up garbage

07:16.740 --> 07:19.569
at Disneyland.

07:19.656 --> 07:21.136
There you are, gentlemen.

07:21.223 --> 07:23.399
- A walk on the wild side.
- Do you have any--

07:23.486 --> 07:24.400
- Ketchup.
- How about any--

07:24.487 --> 07:27.969
- Hot sauce.
- Thanks.

07:28.056 --> 07:29.666
I'll be back in 12 minutes
with your sticky bun

07:29.753 --> 07:32.147
and your seltzer water
and toothpick.

07:32.234 --> 07:35.411
Or maybe just a meat cleaver
and a Hefty bag.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.510
[instrumental music]

07:51.035 --> 07:52.907
'Hey, sweetie,
you're home early.'

07:52.994 --> 07:55.692
Yeah, somebody pulled the
fire alarm during last period.

07:55.779 --> 07:57.912
Boy, those brats will do
anything to get out of class.

07:57.999 --> 08:00.697
Ah, brats, teachers,
when you're getting out early

08:00.784 --> 08:03.004
you don't ask
a lot of questions.

08:06.355 --> 08:07.399
What's this?

08:07.487 --> 08:09.576
Well, you've given me so much

08:09.663 --> 08:11.142
I wanted to do
something nice for you.

08:11.229 --> 08:14.494
Is it the eight grand
you owe me?

08:14.581 --> 08:17.888
Better. Sketch pads
and colored pencils. Woo-hoo!

08:17.975 --> 08:20.369
I'd rather have the dough.

08:20.456 --> 08:22.197
You've made that very clear.

08:22.284 --> 08:24.808
And also I got
this college catalog

08:24.895 --> 08:26.897
that has a lot of art classes.

08:26.984 --> 08:29.639
Oh, Molly, I don't have time
for this kind of stuff.

08:29.726 --> 08:31.554
What, you'd rather
sit in the park with Vince

08:31.641 --> 08:32.860
feeding the ducks?

08:32.947 --> 08:36.690
It's fun.
Plus they really respond to him.

08:36.777 --> 08:41.216
He's-he's like a greasy
Dr. Doolittle.

08:41.303 --> 08:43.000
Alright,
let's shake a tail feather.

08:43.087 --> 08:45.655
The coupon for the Chinese
buffet isn't good after 6:00.

08:45.742 --> 08:48.484
And at 5:45, the cheapskate
owner hides in the kitchen

08:48.571 --> 08:49.920
for 16 minutes.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.139
That's why
you got to get there

08:51.226 --> 08:53.924
while the egg foo
is still young.

08:54.011 --> 08:56.405
Well, mom, at least, you know,
at least think about it.

08:56.492 --> 08:58.625
- Oh, Molly..
- Think about what?

08:58.712 --> 09:00.844
Vince, you are married
to an artist. Did you know that?

09:00.931 --> 09:03.325
You bet. She can put her ankles
behind her head

09:03.412 --> 09:06.633
and push her glasses up
with her tongue.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.026
Not that. My daughter,
the school teacher

09:09.113 --> 09:11.986
is trying to get me to take
an art class at the college.

09:12.073 --> 09:14.554
Right, what are you gonna do?
Play Hacky Sack in the quad?

09:14.641 --> 09:17.121
You'll break a hip.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.296
What are you saying, pal,
that I'm too old

09:18.383 --> 09:19.602
to go back to college?

09:19.689 --> 09:21.256
Yeah, that's exactly
what he's saying.

09:21.343 --> 09:23.693
Way to be supportive, troll.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.782
Hey! This is between me
and your mother.

09:25.869 --> 09:27.088
You're not going to college.

09:27.175 --> 09:29.046
You don't tell me
what to do, bub.

09:29.133 --> 09:30.918
Yeah, you don't tell anybody
in this house what to do, bub.

09:31.005 --> 09:32.572
Don't bark at me.

09:32.659 --> 09:34.878
I-I'm just trying to keep you
from embarrassing yourself.

09:34.965 --> 09:36.967
I was actually pretty good.

09:37.054 --> 09:39.013
Yeah, not pretty good,
really good.

09:39.100 --> 09:41.885
Come on, just because she drew
a pretty horsey 40 years ago

09:41.972 --> 09:44.366
now she's Grandma Moses?

09:44.453 --> 09:47.456
Grandma Moses? Nice. Very nice.

09:47.543 --> 09:48.936
He's calling you old again.

09:49.023 --> 09:51.591
Stay out of this.
she didn't even catch that one.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.333
I think I'll skip
the buffet tonight.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.509
- You can eat alone.
- Alone.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.555
It's a two-for-one coupon.
What am I gonna do?

09:59.642 --> 10:01.557
I'm gonna look like an idiot
sitting there by myself.

10:01.644 --> 10:06.344
You look like an idiot sitting
in a room full of idiots.

10:06.431 --> 10:09.478
Molly, let's you and I
pick out an art course for mama.

10:09.565 --> 10:11.785
Oh, absolutely.

10:11.872 --> 10:13.700
Don't order the Peking duck
'cause it might be one

10:13.787 --> 10:15.223
of your little buddies.

10:18.139 --> 10:22.056
After that statement, I fear our
relationship will never recover.

10:22.143 --> 10:25.755
Really? I make one duck comment
and my dreams come true!

10:33.371 --> 10:35.722
Look at us. We're out,
we're having fun.

10:35.809 --> 10:37.767
Yeah, fun.
Hey, slow down!

10:37.854 --> 10:40.378
You got beginners here,
you little bastard!

10:40.465 --> 10:43.077
Hey, this doesn't have
to stop after we have kids.

10:43.164 --> 10:44.382
You know, we can, we can,
whoa..

10:44.469 --> 10:46.080
...go roller-skating
as a family.

10:46.167 --> 10:50.214
Sure. Why just have strange kids
laughing at me when I fall?

10:50.301 --> 10:53.827
- We did it. One completed lap.
- Can we go home now?

10:53.914 --> 10:56.264
No, we're gonna keep skating
till we get better.

10:56.351 --> 10:58.309
We are not gonna be
that fuddy-duddy couple

10:58.396 --> 11:00.268
that spends
their life watching TV.

11:00.355 --> 11:04.794
It is a flat-screen TV, LCD.
Picture quality is astonishing!

11:04.881 --> 11:07.579
Alright, pal, one more lap.
No regrets.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.407
My only regret's
not choosing skydiving.

11:09.494 --> 11:11.801
- I could be dead by now.
- There we go.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.107
Now we're getting
the hang of it.

11:13.194 --> 11:15.413
It's like
we're walking on air, huh?

11:15.500 --> 11:17.981
- Whoa!
- Damn you!

11:18.068 --> 11:20.767
I should've brought
my service revolver.

11:20.854 --> 11:24.858
Oh, so we can shoot skaters,
but we can't shoot rats?

11:33.910 --> 11:37.000
"Major Tires Destroy Superman."

11:38.872 --> 11:42.876
"Mayor Fires
District Supervisor."

11:42.963 --> 11:44.834
See, now that makes
a lot more sense.

11:47.010 --> 11:49.143
Joyce won't even talk to me now.

11:49.230 --> 11:52.929
And when we were having sex,
she didn't look me in the eye.

11:53.016 --> 11:57.238
Probably makes it harder for her
to pretend you're someone else.

11:57.325 --> 12:03.287
Oh, yeah, kick me while I'm
down, you half-blind bastard.

12:03.374 --> 12:04.593
When are you gonna learn,
Moranto?

12:04.680 --> 12:07.291
You can't forbid
a woman to do something.

12:07.378 --> 12:09.076
They live to defy us.

12:09.163 --> 12:11.774
You know what those
college campuses are like.

12:11.861 --> 12:17.737
Reefer-filled coffeehouses,
beatniks and free love.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.477
Well, I'm hoping
President Eisenhower

12:19.564 --> 12:20.957
cleans up the whole mess.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.048
And college professors
are the worst!

12:25.135 --> 12:27.921
They'll bang anything
with a backpack!

12:28.008 --> 12:29.836
What are you getting
so worked up for?

12:29.923 --> 12:32.621
- Joyce loves you.
- Sure, now.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.841
I'm her hot, sexy boy toy.

12:39.628 --> 12:42.239
Okay.

12:42.326 --> 12:45.329
But what happens when
some artsy-fartsy Svengali

12:45.416 --> 12:47.767
fills her head
with poetry and hope?

12:47.854 --> 12:51.248
It's, "Goodbye, dago."

12:51.335 --> 12:54.382
Look, there are plenty
of other guys out there

12:54.469 --> 12:57.559
that are smarter and
better-looking than both of us.

12:57.646 --> 13:00.040
I already got the belt loop
around my neck.

13:00.127 --> 13:02.129
Go ahead, kick out the chair.

13:05.132 --> 13:09.745
Look, the point being, for
whatever reason, these smart

13:09.832 --> 13:13.140
beautiful women chose us.

13:13.227 --> 13:16.883
And that begs the question,
are they really that smart?

13:21.278 --> 13:22.802
Ah..

13:26.196 --> 13:29.243
I like the way you think.

13:29.330 --> 13:31.985
They can't be perfect
'cause they chose

13:32.072 --> 13:34.639
a couple of melon heads like us.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.554
Exactly.

13:36.641 --> 13:39.427
So you need to be
loving and supportive

13:39.514 --> 13:41.342
and not give her a reason
to start thinking about

13:41.429 --> 13:43.126
how much better she could do.

13:43.213 --> 13:46.347
I see. It's like
shaking keys at a baby

13:46.434 --> 13:49.437
or putting a dog's worm pill
in a piece of cheese.

13:49.524 --> 13:53.702
Right. Love is the cheese,
you're the worm pill.

13:55.660 --> 13:59.316
Boy, for a couple of melonheads,
we sure are smart.

14:09.022 --> 14:11.328
Loving and supportive,
loving and supportive

14:11.415 --> 14:13.635
loving and supportive,
loving and supportive

14:13.722 --> 14:15.724
loving and supportive.

14:18.727 --> 14:20.772
What's all this?

14:20.860 --> 14:23.514
I'm preparing a delicious,
nutritious breakfast

14:23.601 --> 14:25.560
for my beautiful, curvy coed.

14:25.647 --> 14:26.953
Right.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.955
Please sit
and allow me to bring you

14:29.042 --> 14:30.782
a piping hot cup of joe.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.480
Very considerate of you.

14:32.567 --> 14:35.613
Well, you know me,
loving and supportive.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.354
Yep, that's the you I know.

14:37.441 --> 14:40.314
Besides, you crazy college
kids can't live on Red Bull

14:40.401 --> 14:41.968
and Toaster Strudels.

14:42.055 --> 14:43.273
Sure can't.

14:43.360 --> 14:44.884
Can I get a little cream
for my coffee?

14:44.971 --> 14:46.059
Absolutely.

14:46.146 --> 14:48.235
Oh, and maybe some
fresh-squeezed OJ?

14:48.322 --> 14:52.282
Oh, you dig in and I'll try
to rustle up an orange or two.

14:52.369 --> 14:54.937
Not too pulpy.
I don't like it too pulpy.

14:55.024 --> 14:57.635
You're lucky if I find
an orange, Joyce.

14:57.722 --> 15:00.377
- How about some Clamato?
- Oh, forget the juice.

15:00.464 --> 15:03.424
I wouldn't mind
some pepper for these eggs.

15:03.511 --> 15:06.775
What? Is your arm broke?
It's right in front of you.

15:10.257 --> 15:13.347
You know what? I'll just grab
a bite to eat on campus.

15:13.434 --> 15:15.566
Damn it! You're still gonna go?

15:15.653 --> 15:19.875
Even after I hopped around
like a Mexican jumping bean?

15:19.962 --> 15:21.790
Oh, and don't wait up for me.

15:21.877 --> 15:24.880
I might grab a pitcher of beer
and play Foosball with the boys.

15:24.967 --> 15:30.494
Joyce, don't do this!
Come on! I made you breakfast.

15:30.581 --> 15:33.454
So much for being
loving and supportive.

15:33.541 --> 15:35.412
[blows trumpet]

15:42.115 --> 15:44.073
So you're gonna tell me
you didn't enjoy

15:44.160 --> 15:45.814
getting out of school early?

15:45.901 --> 15:48.295
No, I'm telling you, that
when you pull the fire alarm

15:48.382 --> 15:50.123
you can't brag
to the other kids about it.

15:50.210 --> 15:51.167
Why?

15:51.254 --> 15:52.777
Because then they squeal to me

15:52.864 --> 15:54.649
I have to punish you,
and then we both end up

15:54.736 --> 15:57.043
staying after school.

15:57.130 --> 16:00.698
- Oh...so it kinda evens out?
- Yeah, exactly.

16:00.785 --> 16:02.222
Maybe if you weren't
flunking math

16:02.309 --> 16:04.441
you would've seen that, huh?

16:04.528 --> 16:08.054
- I hate math.
- Yeah, everybody hates math.

16:08.141 --> 16:11.405
- Knock, knock.
- Mom, what are you doing here?

16:11.492 --> 16:12.667
I was just in the neighborhood,
realized I hadn't seen

16:12.754 --> 16:14.103
your new classroom.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.018
Well, it's the same
as the old classroom.

16:16.105 --> 16:20.805
One big desk, 35 little desks
and one of those.

16:20.892 --> 16:23.765
- Your daughter's mean.
- Not as mean as I am.

16:23.852 --> 16:25.985
I'd have you tarring highways
chained to ten other

16:26.072 --> 16:28.857
arm-farting brats.

16:28.944 --> 16:32.034
Okay, and detention is over.

16:32.121 --> 16:36.082
Go before the lawsuit begins.
Mom, what are you doing here?

16:36.169 --> 16:37.300
'Aren't you
supposed to be in class?'

16:37.387 --> 16:39.172
Eh, I had to get out of there.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.696
The professor had a ponytail
and open-toed shoes.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.611
The only thing missing
was a sign on his forehead

16:43.698 --> 16:46.222
that said douche.

16:46.309 --> 16:50.705
Mom, it's art school. They're
all gonna be kinda douche-y.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.272
I don't really want
to go to school.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.274
I was just doing it
to piss Vince off.

16:54.361 --> 16:57.059
Well, see? It's win-win.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.148
Molly, I'm done with all that.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.629
I'm very happy
with the life I have.

17:01.716 --> 17:04.284
I've got two beautiful
daughters, a man who adores me.

17:04.371 --> 17:06.242
What else is there?

17:06.329 --> 17:08.723
Mom, you, you have real talent.

17:08.810 --> 17:11.595
I mean, you-you could
make something amazing.

17:11.682 --> 17:16.209
Well, you and your sister
are my two masterpieces.

17:16.296 --> 17:19.255
I'm not gonna do
better than that.

17:19.342 --> 17:22.432
Oh, but you gave up
so much for us.

17:22.519 --> 17:24.782
I didn't give up anything.

17:24.869 --> 17:27.611
You girls were the best thing
that ever happened to me.

17:27.698 --> 17:30.310
Really?

17:30.397 --> 17:32.007
You'll know what I'm talking
about when you have a beautiful

17:32.094 --> 17:35.750
baby of your own.

17:35.837 --> 17:37.969
I love you, mom.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.798
Of course you do. I'm awesome.

17:42.409 --> 17:43.671
[alarm ringing]

17:43.758 --> 17:45.760
God, that kid's an idiot.

17:45.847 --> 17:47.936
He's the worst criminal
I've ever seen.

17:53.724 --> 17:57.989
Hey, hey, Gladys,
let Anthony have some.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.253
Anthony, stand up for yourself.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.951
I can't always be here
to protect you.

18:03.038 --> 18:06.650
There you go, play nice.

18:06.737 --> 18:08.696
You don't know this,
because you got brains

18:08.783 --> 18:12.178
the size of a wasabi pea,
but you got it made.

18:12.265 --> 18:14.310
No worries, no heartache.

18:14.397 --> 18:17.357
Just floating on the pond
until some dumb sap shows up

18:17.444 --> 18:19.228
with a sack of stale bread.

18:19.315 --> 18:22.188
Gladys, I told you, play nice
or I'm crushing your skull

18:22.275 --> 18:24.581
with my boot heel.
I'm kidding.

18:24.668 --> 18:27.018
I'm exaggerating
to make a point.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.543
But I will pelt you
with my car keys.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.284
There you go.

18:31.371 --> 18:34.548
Hey, fella, is there room on
that bench for your wife?

18:34.635 --> 18:36.158
Always room for you.

18:38.682 --> 18:40.467
You been out here all day?

18:40.554 --> 18:42.425
Five loaves worth.

18:42.512 --> 18:47.169
Ten minutes ago, it looked like
Anthony crapped another duck.

18:47.256 --> 18:51.565
Well, you know Anthony,
he doesn't chew his food.

18:51.652 --> 18:55.134
He's like his daddy that way.

18:55.221 --> 18:58.920
- How was school?
- It was alright.

18:59.007 --> 19:00.704
I don't think I'm going back.

19:00.791 --> 19:02.750
Did the other kids
make fun of you?

19:02.837 --> 19:05.361
'Cause I'll show up at that
classroom swinging a tire iron.

19:05.448 --> 19:08.016
Take it easy.
It was nothing like that.

19:08.103 --> 19:10.018
It's just not who I am anymore.

19:10.105 --> 19:13.717
Well, don't quit on my account,
'cause the last thing I want

19:13.804 --> 19:15.458
is to hold you back
from something

19:15.545 --> 19:17.373
you really want to do.

19:17.460 --> 19:21.334
What I really want to do
is be sitting here with you.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.466
And Anthony.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.381
And Gladys.

19:25.468 --> 19:28.167
And Walter.
Where, where's Walter?

19:28.254 --> 19:30.256
He ate nine pieces of sourdough
and passed out

19:30.343 --> 19:32.475
in one of the rowboats.

19:32.562 --> 19:36.958
Walter doesn't have
a lot of self-control.

19:37.045 --> 19:39.613
He's a good bird though.

19:39.700 --> 19:42.485
They're all good birds.

19:42.572 --> 19:44.095
[instrumental music]

19:55.411 --> 19:56.804
Next time we go skating,
we need to come up

19:56.891 --> 19:58.545
with some sort of signal,
so when I fall

19:58.632 --> 20:00.982
you can get
to me a little sooner.

20:01.069 --> 20:03.724
I think you screaming,
"For the love of God, help me"

20:03.811 --> 20:06.988
was a pretty clear signal.

20:07.075 --> 20:08.859
Oh!

20:08.946 --> 20:11.514
Hey, kids, turns out,
I'm her muse.

20:17.041 --> 20:18.695
Then again, it's not how
many times you fall down

20:18.782 --> 20:20.175
it's how many times
you get back up.

20:20.262 --> 20:21.698
Yep, couldn't agree more.

20:28.183 --> 20:29.924
[theme music]
