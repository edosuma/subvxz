00:06.307 --> 00:07.175
BOB LEE: Previously on
"Shooter"...

00:08.509 --> 00:10.111
What can I do for you,
Captain?

00:10.144 --> 00:11.479
ISAAC: This was written
to the president,

00:11.512 --> 00:13.281
states that in 21 days
he'll be executed.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.083
I'm asking for your help.
Your country needs you, Bob Lee.

00:15.116 --> 00:17.251
What did he want?
Nothing, baby.

00:17.285 --> 00:18.819
She said he offered you a job.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.089
Some sniper made a crazy
threat against the president.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.623
President's visit means
they prioritize

00:22.656 --> 00:24.658
potential threats
into three groups.

00:24.692 --> 00:27.428
If someone seems off, send it
to me, and I'll pass it along.

00:27.461 --> 00:30.364
Jack Payne, Bob Lee Swagger.
Payne's Counterterrorism.

00:30.398 --> 00:32.233
BOB LEE: If he's hunting,
he's gonna wait for his shot,

00:32.266 --> 00:33.534
and it'll be perfect.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.336
ISAAC: I need
a complete work-up.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.271
Distances, location
possibilities, everything.

00:37.305 --> 00:39.273
BOB LEE: Knowing exactly where
the president will be standing

00:39.307 --> 00:41.142
gives Solotov an advantage
that's almost unbeatable.

00:41.175 --> 00:42.643
He knows the window
around the event,

00:42.676 --> 00:44.612
and he knows the exact moment
to take the shot,

00:44.645 --> 00:46.414
and he's gonna take
it from here.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.581
JACK: It's Payne.
He's not here.

00:47.615 --> 00:49.183
What?
I made a mistake!

00:49.217 --> 00:52.153
[gunshot, screaming]

00:52.186 --> 00:53.521
Hey, Swagger.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.289
[gunshots]

00:55.323 --> 00:58.359
[intense music]

00:58.392 --> 01:00.561
Stay on the ground, now!
Hands behind your head!

01:00.594 --> 01:04.198
My name is Bob Lee Swagger!
I did not kill the president!

01:06.300 --> 01:09.570
[sirens blaring]

01:09.603 --> 01:13.207
My wife, my daughter,
make sure they're safe.

01:13.241 --> 01:14.442
Why would your wife and
daughter be in danger?

01:14.475 --> 01:17.445
[grunts]
NADINE: Hey, talk to me.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.513
President, not hit.
Repeat. The president, not hit.

01:19.547 --> 01:21.182
NADINE: Then what happened?
BOSACK: He missed.

01:21.215 --> 01:24.718
BOSACK: He killed
the Ukrainian president.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.588
WOMAN: Tragedy has struck
with an attack

01:27.621 --> 01:29.523
on the presidential convoy
in Seattle.

01:29.557 --> 01:34.195
[men speaking
foreign languages]

01:34.228 --> 01:36.330
WOMAN: Viktor Abromovich
has been killed

01:36.364 --> 01:37.898
during an apparent attempt

01:37.931 --> 01:39.533
on the life of
the U.S. president.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.369
[men speaking
foreign languages]

01:41.402 --> 01:42.536
WOMAN: We will bring you
more details

01:42.570 --> 01:44.305
as we receive them.

01:44.338 --> 01:47.608
*

01:47.641 --> 01:49.477
MAN: Angel, ready for takeoff.

01:49.510 --> 01:51.712
Wheels up as soon
as Flashlight is aboard.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.348
[indistinct chatter]

01:54.382 --> 01:55.649
WOMAN: Bravo Team to Angel,
Flashlight is...

01:55.683 --> 01:57.218
MAN: We're deploying, sir.

01:57.251 --> 01:58.519
MAN: East side is clear.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.221
They got him.
Who?

02:00.254 --> 02:01.355
The shooter.

02:01.389 --> 02:03.257
Some guy named Bob Lee Swagger.

02:03.291 --> 02:06.360
Crazy bastard jumped out
of a window to avoid being shot.

02:06.394 --> 02:07.361
He lived?

02:07.395 --> 02:08.762
Yeah, unbelievable, right?

02:08.796 --> 02:11.532
They're taking him to USW.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.467
You said Swagger?
I served with that guy.

02:13.501 --> 02:16.136
He's a Marine sniper.
I better get over there.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.440
Clear the room.
MAN: Yes, sir.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.376
HOWARD: You too, Doctor.

02:22.410 --> 02:25.313
Now...
I want my lawyer.

02:25.346 --> 02:28.316
And I wanted tickets
to "Hamilton" for Christmas.

02:28.349 --> 02:29.583
His name is Sam Vincent.

02:29.617 --> 02:32.453
This is FBI
Special Agent-in-Charge,

02:32.486 --> 02:35.456
Howard Utey, Seattle office,
conducting an interview

02:35.489 --> 02:37.691
with Bob Lee Swagger
in the USW Medical Center,

02:37.725 --> 02:40.294
date and time stamped
on this recording.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.263
Mr. Swagger,
were you acting alone

02:42.296 --> 02:43.497
when you tried to assassinate

02:43.531 --> 02:45.299
the president
of the United States?

02:49.570 --> 02:51.705
[electronic beep,
door clicks]

02:54.508 --> 02:56.477
My name is John Dominguez,
Mrs. Swagger.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.546
I'm the Assistant
Special Agent-in-Charge.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.448
I've been here six hours.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.483
I want to talk to my daughter.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.285
She's staying with my sister,
Anna Wallingford.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.519
Please get her on the phone.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.455
Did you husband ever
give you any indication

03:07.488 --> 03:09.357
that he was gonna assassinate
the president?

03:09.390 --> 03:11.759
No, because he didn't do it.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.294
This is insane.

03:13.327 --> 03:16.264
I came to you, remember?

03:16.297 --> 03:18.499
Now, I want to speak
with my daughter.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.700
You want to help your family?

03:19.733 --> 03:21.269
Someone get her
some fresh clothes.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.536
Answer my question.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.438
Give me the sister's
phone number.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.274
If you don't answer it, then
we'll start with obstruction

03:26.307 --> 03:27.841
and end with Mary having
both parents in prison,

03:27.875 --> 03:30.511
not just one.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.614
Did your husband ever
give you any indication

03:33.647 --> 03:36.317
that he was gonna attempt the
assassination of the president?

03:36.350 --> 03:38.319
I heard the president
wasn't hit.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.488
The Ukrainian president was.

03:40.521 --> 03:43.324
Well, that's how you know
it wasn't my husband.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.726
Bob Lee Swagger doesn't miss.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.829
[electronic beep,
door clicks]

03:48.862 --> 03:50.398
It's your daughter.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.568
Mary?

03:54.602 --> 03:56.270
MARY: Hi, Mommy.
Hi, hi, sweetheart.

03:56.304 --> 03:57.805
Hold on.
Can I have a moment, please?

03:57.838 --> 04:00.374
NADINE: Yeah, of course.
MARY: Why aren't you home?

04:00.408 --> 04:02.843
What the hell do you think
you're doing, Memphis?

04:02.876 --> 04:06.414
I know that look, sir.
My mother had it.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.681
Her husband was a Marine.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.483
She's used to being
a single parent.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.619
The most important thing
to a single parent, her kid.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.721
Letting her talk to her kid
was an act of trust.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.657
If she's gonna say anything,
she'll say it now.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.859
Bringing in Swagger
may have bought you some rope.

04:18.892 --> 04:22.763
Just make sure you don't hang
yourself with it.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.865
Get in there
and get her talking.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.403
Okay, Mr. Utey,
you've had your moment.

04:29.437 --> 04:31.739
Time to respect
the Constitution again.

04:31.772 --> 04:35.309
Sam Vincent.
I represent Mr. Swagger.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.777
I'll look forward to receiving

04:36.810 --> 04:39.813
a copy of that recording
from your office.

04:39.847 --> 04:42.350
I hope you like
the sound of my voice,

04:42.383 --> 04:43.851
'cause your client
didn't say a word.

04:43.884 --> 04:47.421
That's because
he's very smart.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.327
Now start at the beginning

04:53.361 --> 04:55.396
and don't leave out any detail.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.765
They could be hiding recording
devices anywhere in this room.

04:57.798 --> 04:58.932
Wouldn't matter anyway.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.834
None of it'd be admissible.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.803
I'm not worried about a trial.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.705
I'm not gonna make it that far.

05:12.446 --> 05:13.814
They read you your rights?

05:13.847 --> 05:16.617
Twice.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.520
I'm sorry about dragging
you into this, Sam.

05:19.553 --> 05:20.688
I'm in deep shit.

05:20.721 --> 05:23.791
You didn't drag me
into anything.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.360
Your daddy would crawl out
of his grave and hunt me down

05:26.394 --> 05:28.596
if I didn't come.

05:28.629 --> 05:30.631
Mary is with
your sister-in-law,

05:30.664 --> 05:33.634
and Julie's at the FBI.

05:33.667 --> 05:37.505
They haven't charged her
with anything, but, my guess,

05:37.538 --> 05:39.807
she won't be taking
any vacations soon.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.975
SAM: She won't be
going home either.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.844
They emptied out your house

05:43.877 --> 05:46.380
and moved its contents
to a federal warehouse--

05:46.414 --> 05:48.682
your whole research
on how to take the shot,

05:48.716 --> 05:51.852
locations,
trajectories,

05:51.885 --> 05:53.554
photos.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.589
News reports
are indicating the Feds

05:55.623 --> 05:58.459
have security footage
of you two weeks ago

05:58.492 --> 06:00.561
scouting the shot.

06:00.594 --> 06:01.929
And they're already
issuing warrants

06:01.962 --> 06:03.797
to check
private security cameras.

06:03.831 --> 06:07.535
Finally, there's
the matter of your weapons.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.703
Seven long rifles,
semiautomatic,

06:09.737 --> 06:12.540
bolt action,
handguns,

06:12.573 --> 06:14.775
thousands of rounds of ammo,

06:14.808 --> 06:16.877
powder,
copper,

06:16.910 --> 06:19.179
and, of course,
the murder weapon.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.182
[intense music]

06:22.215 --> 06:27.655
*

06:27.688 --> 06:30.891
Forensics recovered the slug
about 30 minutes ago.

06:30.924 --> 06:34.394
The evidence is compelling.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.701
[sighs]

06:40.734 --> 06:43.604
I'd say for a guy
who spent his entire life

06:43.637 --> 06:45.973
learning to be invisible,

06:46.006 --> 06:49.943
you certainly left
a lot of crumbs.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.646
Hell, you left
the whole damn cake.

06:52.680 --> 06:56.450
Does that sound like me?

06:56.484 --> 06:57.951
All right, what's next?

06:57.985 --> 07:00.488
Because your injuries
are not life-threatening,

07:00.521 --> 07:03.023
you're being moved
to a federal penitentiary.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.658
Jesus.

07:04.692 --> 07:06.660
Now, I've arranged
for protective custody

07:06.694 --> 07:08.028
until your arraignment.

07:08.061 --> 07:11.732
Anything you can tell me

07:11.765 --> 07:13.501
that would be helpful?

07:13.534 --> 07:21.542
*

07:26.647 --> 07:28.782
WOMAN: Disgraced Marine sniper
Bob Lee Swagger

07:28.816 --> 07:30.851
arrived in federal prison today

07:30.884 --> 07:32.720
where he faces
a litany of charges,

07:32.753 --> 07:33.921
including the assassination...

07:33.954 --> 07:35.556
[indistinct chatter]

07:35.589 --> 07:36.557
Yo, there he is!

07:36.590 --> 07:39.593
[indistinct yelling]

07:40.928 --> 07:43.797
[shouting]

07:43.831 --> 07:46.800

[music intensifies]

08:32.946 --> 08:39.019
*

08:39.052 --> 08:40.821
Your country needs you,
Bob Lee.

08:40.854 --> 08:45.525
*

08:48.596 --> 08:51.565
[dramatic music]

08:51.599 --> 08:57.905
*

09:00.974 --> 09:03.977
[gunshots]

09:07.681 --> 09:10.651
God damn it!

09:10.684 --> 09:12.285
This shit is rigged.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.589
Isaac.

09:15.623 --> 09:16.990
[laughs]

09:17.024 --> 09:19.126
You want a game?

09:19.159 --> 09:22.129
Hey.

09:22.162 --> 09:25.198
Swagger survived
a three-story fall.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.668
No one could've predicted that.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.002
Sloppy.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.671
You wanted Payne on the job.
I didn't.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.339
Payne is a pit bull.
You've got the leash.

09:32.372 --> 09:34.207
Don't play victim.
It doesn't suit you.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.744
When are you going back
to Russia?

09:36.777 --> 09:37.945
Jet's waiting.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.613
Air travel is still
restricted.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.148
We're wheels up
when I get on the plane.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.283
The advantage of working
for the Company.

09:43.316 --> 09:45.152
He'll talk eventually.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.954
Time has a way of playing
with a man's mind,

09:46.987 --> 09:48.121
especially when he's locked up.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.156
Trust me.
I know.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.624
You don't know Swagger.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.325
You set him up,
framed him for a murder,

09:52.359 --> 09:54.361
and tried to kill him.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.163
Don't give me
this semper fi shit, okay?

09:56.196 --> 09:58.065
It's not about loyalty.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.733
It's about strategy.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.301
He knows
his family's exposed.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.071
They're gonna arraign him
on Monday.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.640
He's in protective custody
in a federal prison.

10:06.674 --> 10:10.343
Emphasis on federal.

10:10.377 --> 10:11.945
Do svidaniya.

10:19.419 --> 10:21.254
Any issues?

10:21.288 --> 10:22.656
Zero.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.124
Paperwork was all in order.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.726
No one suspected a thing.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.995
Swagger has to be taken out
of protective custody

10:28.028 --> 10:29.329
and put in general population.

10:29.362 --> 10:32.199
He's the most well-known
inmate in the world.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.767
I can't just magically move him.

10:33.801 --> 10:36.303
Here, plant this
on the HVAC system.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.105

It'll do the rest.

It's magic, asshole.

You got to go.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.453
Go where?

It's only temporary until
they clean out the gas.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.224
Raines will take you
to area D.

10:57.257 --> 11:01.228
No smoking, no gambling,
no working out,

no gang-related activities,

11:08.736 --> 11:10.437
no phone calls till
after your arraignment.

11:10.470 --> 11:15.108
Now, the warden says that
we have to treat you special,

11:15.142 --> 11:17.144
but I have
my own version of special.

Good luck, shooter.

Hey, T,
who's the fresh meat?

11:33.761 --> 11:35.228
I don't know.

11:35.262 --> 11:36.263
WOMAN: There he is.
There he is.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.831
Officer Timmons,
Officer Timmons,

11:37.865 --> 11:39.733
can you tell us anything
about Bob Lee Swagger?

11:39.767 --> 11:42.770
How did you know he would be
in that hotel room?

11:42.803 --> 11:45.305
Uh, I been on the job
for a while.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.840
You learn to trust your gut.

11:46.874 --> 11:51.411
How did you know he was there?

11:51.444 --> 11:53.814
I was getting coffee
when I saw him,

11:53.847 --> 11:55.348
and there was something
about him--

11:55.382 --> 11:56.850
just felt off,

11:56.884 --> 11:58.518
so I followed him
just to make sure.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.453
As soon as I heard the shot,
I kicked the door in.

12:00.487 --> 12:01.889
Please shut the hell up.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.757
And I just trusted
my instinct.

my protection.

I don't need your help!

12:51.238 --> 12:52.405
Oh, I'm sure you don't,

12:52.439 --> 12:54.875
but no matter how many
of them you fight,

12:54.908 --> 12:57.510
the guards will not put you
in the hospital,

12:57.544 --> 13:00.347
not when there's a price
on your head.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.549
One of the guards
will most certainly share in.

13:02.582 --> 13:05.152
Right, girls?
Off you go.

13:05.185 --> 13:08.388
[indistinct chatter]

13:08.421 --> 13:10.223
I'm Alexander Prosovich.

Hmm.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.230
[speaking Russian]

13:17.264 --> 13:20.300
I've taken the liberty to have
your things moved to my cell.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.869
I'm not looking to recruit you,

13:21.902 --> 13:23.603
although you'd be very welcome.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.505
I only wish to thank you.

13:25.538 --> 13:26.506
Thank me?

13:26.539 --> 13:29.142
For your bullet.

13:29.176 --> 13:31.444
You did something
that my Russian brethren

13:31.478 --> 13:33.280
dreamed of for years.

13:33.313 --> 13:36.216
To us, you are a hero.

13:36.249 --> 13:39.386
So, uh...come.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.588
To the hero go
the spoils, right?

13:41.621 --> 13:45.158
Or at least some
very good contraband.

13:47.627 --> 13:50.864
Seems like an odd place
to meet.

13:50.898 --> 13:53.500
Let me see your .45.

14:11.684 --> 14:15.555
Appears to be working
just fine.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.464
Is that about how far you were
from Bob Lee?

14:24.497 --> 14:27.234
He was moving, man.
He was already running.

14:27.267 --> 14:28.969
And you didn't get cocky?

14:29.002 --> 14:32.005
Maybe say his name so he could
make sure it was you?

14:32.039 --> 14:33.941
You weren't there.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.576
No. I'm here.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.411
Move it a foot and shoot again.

14:38.445 --> 14:41.381
I'm out of bullets.

14:41.414 --> 14:44.384
I planned it
down to the second.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.554
All you had to do
was shoot him.

14:47.587 --> 14:50.423
I know you've killed men 'cause
you brag about it all the time.

14:50.457 --> 14:51.624
Shit happens.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.927
Not on my watch.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.362
Shoot again.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.264
I told you
I'm out of bullets.

You may draw your check
from someone else,

but you work for me.

15:05.705 --> 15:08.641
Are we clear?

why your husband

15:23.991 --> 15:25.092
might have done this,
Mrs. Swagger?

WOMAN: Are you aware
of the charges...

15:26.726 --> 15:28.361
WOMAN: Mrs. Swagger, is
your husband an angry person?

I am so sorry.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.602
They've been out there
for over an hour.

15:35.635 --> 15:37.004
They were waiting
like vultures.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.638
Sam, thank you
for bringing her.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.040
Of course.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.641
Thank you so much
for everything.

15:41.674 --> 15:44.644
You don't have to thank me.
Family first always.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.446
Speaking of which,
there's someone inside

15:46.479 --> 15:47.747

Mwah! Mwah.
Hi.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.625
Where's Daddy?

15:58.658 --> 16:02.295
Daddy is on a mission,
sweetheart.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.397
Why are all the people here?

16:04.431 --> 16:07.734
Well, even though Daddy's
missions are top secret,

16:07.767 --> 16:09.736
those folks want
to find out about them.

16:09.769 --> 16:12.639
We never talk about Daddy's
missions with strangers.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.107
Never. Mwah!

16:14.141 --> 16:16.009
Now, what have
you been doing without me?

16:16.043 --> 16:19.546
I've been making cookies
with Aunt Anne and Uncle Jim.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.314
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.416
We haven't had any TV on,
and the backyard's empty.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.052
Thank you so much, Jim.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.719
I appreciate it.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.421
Sorry about all of this.

16:28.455 --> 16:30.123
All right, kiddo.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.025
Let's make sure the
next batch doesn't burn, huh?

16:32.059 --> 16:33.726
I'm gonna have
to head back to the office.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.662
What is it?

16:35.695 --> 16:38.165
They're saying Bob Lee
wrote an email,

16:38.198 --> 16:40.667
something about wanting the
Medal of Honor like his father.

16:40.700 --> 16:41.668
Says he's mad about it.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.036
That's crazy.

16:43.070 --> 16:44.771
Bob Lee doesn't care
about medals.

16:44.804 --> 16:47.607
Look, I should go out there and
say something and defend him.

16:47.640 --> 16:49.609
I know you're feeling
very powerless,

16:49.642 --> 16:52.445
but whoever's pulling
the strings is not.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.747
They're smart,
and they're deadly.

16:54.781 --> 16:58.085
This is complicated on levels
we are not prepared for.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.786
Bob Lee is gonna figure
this out,

16:59.819 --> 17:01.454
and we're gonna help him,

17:01.488 --> 17:03.356
but you need to stay
out of the crosshairs

17:03.390 --> 17:05.592
until he does.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.060
How the hell
did you miss it?

17:07.094 --> 17:08.728
Sir, we spoke about Swagger.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.730
I told you his record
was sterling,

17:10.763 --> 17:12.799
and I had no idea why
he was with the Charlies.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.434
You didn't say
the deadliest sniper

17:14.467 --> 17:16.136
in the history of
the Marine Corps

17:16.169 --> 17:17.837
sent an email to the president
demanding a Medal of Honor.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.606
That's because
it wasn't there.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.174
Are you saying that someone
placed it in his file

17:21.208 --> 17:22.809
after you cleared it?

17:22.842 --> 17:24.744
Or, to put it another way,
maybe there's more likely

17:24.777 --> 17:27.114
a government conspiracy than you
doing your job half-assed.

17:27.147 --> 17:28.648
The Bureau appreciates
your work,

17:28.681 --> 17:30.417
but you'd better get used
to your desk,

17:30.450 --> 17:31.751
'cause you're gonna
be there for a while.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.220
I'm the only one
Julie Swagger trusts.

17:33.253 --> 17:35.088
I'll find
another female agent.

17:35.122 --> 17:38.125
Dismissed, Memphis.

17:38.158 --> 17:41.861
[Russian hip-hop music]

17:41.894 --> 17:43.630
They don't mind you
having a knife in here?

17:43.663 --> 17:45.232
Of course they mind,

17:45.265 --> 17:47.467
but as long as
I don't stick it into anyone,

17:47.500 --> 17:49.102
and keep paying them off,

17:49.136 --> 17:50.703
they'll overlook it.

17:50.737 --> 17:53.240
Cherkisovkaja?
Help yourself.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.442
No, I'm good.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.844
If you ever get out of here,

17:57.877 --> 18:00.413
you should go to Horlivka.

18:00.447 --> 18:01.814
You'll have a lot
of friends there,

18:01.848 --> 18:03.816
Russian friends.

18:03.850 --> 18:07.254
The man you killed,
Abromovich,

18:07.287 --> 18:09.256
not a good man.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.524
Who's gonna replace him?

18:11.558 --> 18:14.527
A leader of Parliament
till next election,

18:14.561 --> 18:16.129
but he's reasonable.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.131
He's smart and fair.

18:18.165 --> 18:21.801
He's very likely
to be their next president.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.703
Very good for us.

18:25.605 --> 18:29.476
I like you, Bob Lee.
You don't speak much.

18:29.509 --> 18:33.146
Very refreshing.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.647
Hold on a second.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.649
What do you need?

18:36.683 --> 18:38.551
A drink, a smoke?

18:38.585 --> 18:39.552
Jesus.

18:39.586 --> 18:40.753
Maybe something stronger.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.490
Benzos, pot, coke?

18:43.523 --> 18:45.592
What the hell did you do
on the outside?

18:45.625 --> 18:49.829
I did what was asked of me.

18:49.862 --> 18:53.600
You want to call your wife?

18:53.633 --> 18:54.934
Can they trace this?

18:54.967 --> 18:58.471
Nah, but don't read her
"Crime and Punishment."

19:06.746 --> 19:10.517
Hi, honey.

19:10.550 --> 19:13.253
Either we talk,
or I will.

19:22.662 --> 19:26.366
Why?

19:26.399 --> 19:28.268
How long did we serve together?

19:28.301 --> 19:30.470
Almost three years.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.405
And how'd you explain
that away,

19:32.439 --> 19:33.606
our friendship?

19:33.640 --> 19:36.376
I didn't explain it.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.378
I reported it.

19:38.411 --> 19:41.481
And I didn't characterize
our relationship as...

19:41.514 --> 19:42.682
friendly.

19:42.715 --> 19:46.453
You know how many missions
we ran together?

19:46.486 --> 19:48.855
53.

19:48.888 --> 19:52.959
53 times, I went outside the
wire thinking you had my six,

19:52.992 --> 19:54.994
and now this.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.564
I never should have saved
your ass in Musa Qala.

19:57.597 --> 20:01.368
That's not how I remember it.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.870
As I recall, you disobeyed
a direct order.

20:03.903 --> 20:08.475
And yet, here you stand.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.677
So who did it?

20:10.710 --> 20:14.314
Who took the shot?

20:14.347 --> 20:15.915
I'm guessing
it wasn't Solotov.

20:15.948 --> 20:18.485
You took the shot, Bob Lee.

20:18.518 --> 20:19.652
Everyone knows that.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.689
Same old Captain Johnson,

20:22.722 --> 20:25.492

[scoffs]

20:25.525 --> 20:27.894
Pretty soon, all those spaces
in your head are gonna fill up,

20:27.927 --> 20:29.496
and then what?

20:29.529 --> 20:32.632
Where are you gonna put all
the bad shit you've done?

20:32.665 --> 20:37.904
You've never understood
the burden of leadership.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.506
You may have killed
a lot of men,

20:39.539 --> 20:41.474
but you've never ordered
one to battle

20:41.508 --> 20:43.042
knowing he would die.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.445
You framed me for murder.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.914
Stop acting like
you're Chesty Puller.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.716
What am I doing here?

20:49.749 --> 20:52.452
Who are you working for?

20:52.485 --> 20:54.454
I thought you wanted to talk.
I guess I was wrong.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.489
'Cause they'll kill my family!

20:56.523 --> 20:59.025
You know I'm right!

20:59.058 --> 21:01.761
I can handle whatever's
coming my way,

21:01.794 --> 21:04.664
but they don't deserve it.

21:04.697 --> 21:07.500
My daughter saw you, man,
when you came to my house!

21:07.534 --> 21:08.635
She saw you!

21:08.668 --> 21:09.769
She's only six years old.

21:09.802 --> 21:11.438
You don't go
to all this trouble

21:11.471 --> 21:13.005
and leave loose ends.

21:13.039 --> 21:17.544
You know I'm right.

21:17.577 --> 21:22.482
There's only one thing
I can do to protect them.

21:22.515 --> 21:25.485
I'll confess.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.523
What'd you say?

21:30.557 --> 21:33.660
I'll confess to trying
to kill the president.

21:33.693 --> 21:36.529
I won't grant any interviews.
I won't write a book.

21:36.563 --> 21:39.532
I'll fade away...

21:39.566 --> 21:42.101
but there's a price.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.637
My wife and daughter
are left alone...

21:44.671 --> 21:46.739
forever!

21:46.773 --> 21:49.776
Tell whoever you're working for
I'm ready to deal.

21:52.111 --> 21:54.447
The sooner you confess...

21:54.481 --> 21:56.383
the better...

21:56.416 --> 21:57.684
for everyone.

22:01.087 --> 22:02.422
Put these in too.

22:02.455 --> 22:04.557
That's a lot of dollies
you have.

22:04.591 --> 22:06.759
This one is for Lily.
Okay.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.428
And this one is for me.

22:08.461 --> 22:10.563
And this is an extra
if anybody else wants to play.

22:10.597 --> 22:11.731
[laughing]
Okay.

22:11.764 --> 22:12.832
[phone buzzing]
Hold on.

22:12.865 --> 22:15.001
Oh.
Hi, Sue.

22:15.034 --> 22:17.504
Mary's very excited to--

22:17.537 --> 22:20.507
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

22:20.540 --> 22:22.041
What is it, Mommy?

22:22.074 --> 22:25.612
I know these things
can sneak up on you, so...

22:25.645 --> 22:28.448
I hope she feels better.

22:28.481 --> 22:31.017
Okay.
Let me know.

22:31.050 --> 22:33.686
[sighs] I'm sorry, Mouse.
That was Lily's mom.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.556
Lily's not feeling well,
so she has to cancel.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.591
But our picnic...
I know you're bummed,

22:38.625 --> 22:41.060
but how about instead we have
a Mama and Mouse day?

22:41.093 --> 22:42.629
Yeah!

22:42.662 --> 22:46.032
That will be even better
than just a picnic.

22:46.065 --> 22:47.634
Jules, there's someone here
to see you--

22:47.667 --> 22:49.736
FBI Agent Memphis.

22:51.838 --> 22:53.540
Sorry to do this
so cloak-and-dagger.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.608
I came through the back door
to avoid--

22:55.642 --> 22:57.176
Do I need my lawyer?

22:57.209 --> 23:01.448
I'm here in
a nonofficial capacity.

23:01.481 --> 23:05.084
Did your husband ever talk
to you about wanting medals?

23:05.117 --> 23:08.054
My husband respected
the Medal of Honor.

23:08.087 --> 23:09.622
His father received it.

23:09.656 --> 23:12.892
No Marine
would ever demand it.

23:12.925 --> 23:15.762
You're asking
the wrong question.

23:15.795 --> 23:17.797
What's the right question?

23:17.830 --> 23:20.633
Where was the email
sent from?

23:20.667 --> 23:23.503
Well, the IP address was
traced to the Harbor library.

23:23.536 --> 23:26.506
[chuckles] Bob Lee's never
stepped foot in that place.

23:26.539 --> 23:27.774
I doubt he even knows
where it is.

23:27.807 --> 23:30.610
You read the email.

23:30.643 --> 23:31.911
They bragged
about his kill count,

23:31.944 --> 23:34.080
and they used
the public number.

23:34.113 --> 23:35.882
His number's actually
much higher.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.784
Someone else wrote
that email.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.452
You seem pretty sure.

23:39.486 --> 23:40.587
And you snuck
into my sister's house

23:40.620 --> 23:41.888
to ask me a question

23:41.921 --> 23:45.892
you know I'm gonna have
to answer officially.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.560
You don't think he did it.

23:51.598 --> 23:52.865
Right.

23:52.899 --> 23:55.668
Have you been over
the evidence from our house?

23:55.702 --> 23:57.203
I've seen the report.
Why?

23:57.236 --> 24:00.907
It occurs to me that
if Bob Lee had a visitor,

24:00.940 --> 24:05.111
let's say an old friend
he hadn't seen in a long time,

24:05.144 --> 24:09.549
they would've left a way
for him to get ahold of them.

24:09.582 --> 24:11.217
I have a date
with my daughter.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.786
You can let yourself
out the front door.

24:13.820 --> 24:16.856
I have nothing to hide.

24:16.889 --> 24:21.160
[indistinct chatter]

24:21.193 --> 24:23.229
You're wasting your time,
my friend.

24:23.262 --> 24:24.831
You will not escape.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.933
I know the look.

24:26.966 --> 24:29.135
It's not my first time
in prison.

24:29.168 --> 24:30.937
I can't stay here forever.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.640
After the arraignment,
they'll move me.

24:36.809 --> 24:39.946
Ah, Pavlo Tenney, rapist.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.148
This is the third time
they've caught him.

24:42.181 --> 24:45.184
He blinded the girl
so she couldn't identify him.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.586
So how'd they catch him?

24:46.619 --> 24:48.688
Lots of muscle,
not very smart.

24:48.721 --> 24:53.259
The girl's fiancĂ©
lived long enough to ID.

24:53.292 --> 24:54.661
You have any family?

24:54.694 --> 24:55.728
Yeah.

24:55.762 --> 24:59.165
My wife, two mistresses,
a mother.

24:59.198 --> 25:00.800
Yeah.

25:00.833 --> 25:03.002
How do you keep them safe
while you're in here?

25:03.035 --> 25:05.638
We come from different worlds,
my friend.

25:05.672 --> 25:07.239
No one will touch my family.

25:07.273 --> 25:09.909
It would be
like touching plutonium.

25:09.942 --> 25:11.277
[chuckles]

25:11.310 --> 25:12.879
You asking for yourself?

25:12.912 --> 25:15.582
I would've assumed
you had a plan.

25:15.615 --> 25:18.751
Not for this.

25:18.785 --> 25:21.888
Sanya.

25:21.921 --> 25:24.791
Spasiba.
Give me your hand.

25:24.824 --> 25:26.893
Memorize this number,

25:26.926 --> 25:28.628
then wash it off.

25:28.661 --> 25:31.631
If your family
ever needs help,

25:31.664 --> 25:33.900
end-of-the-world sort of help,

25:33.933 --> 25:36.969
call this number
and ask for Casper.

25:37.003 --> 25:40.740
Tell whoever answers you're
a friend of Alexander Prosovich.

25:40.773 --> 25:43.743
There will be a cost,
possibly a great one,

25:43.776 --> 25:47.847
but I can guarantee
that your family will be safe.

25:51.818 --> 25:54.787
[dramatic music]

25:54.821 --> 25:58.658
*

25:58.691 --> 26:01.327
It might be a shit station,
but the vodka's good.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.963
Thank God for small favors.
[clears throat]

26:03.996 --> 26:07.266
The shooter still lives.

26:07.299 --> 26:08.334
It's being handled.

26:08.367 --> 26:10.336
I don't like the unknown.

26:10.369 --> 26:13.372
Then get out
of the espionage business.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.742
[chuckles]

26:17.877 --> 26:22.081
I met with Putin
in an office like this.

26:22.114 --> 26:25.251
He understood
the value...

26:25.284 --> 26:27.954
of trust.

26:27.987 --> 26:32.358
Now, do I need to call him?

26:32.391 --> 26:33.359
Great.

26:33.392 --> 26:34.927
Then we're in business,

26:34.961 --> 26:37.797
and the new president can
proceed with nationalization

26:37.830 --> 26:39.098
in a matter of weeks, no?

26:39.131 --> 26:41.834
When Swagger is
in the ground.

26:41.868 --> 26:45.672
Really?
Huh.

26:45.705 --> 26:48.641
How's the reporter lady?

26:48.675 --> 26:51.277
She in a hole around here?

26:51.310 --> 26:55.882
Perhaps we dig a hole
for you, Mr. Meachum.

26:55.915 --> 26:57.950
[chuckles]

26:57.984 --> 27:01.888
Grigory, we're friends.
Call me Hugh.

27:01.921 --> 27:03.790
Now, look...

27:06.392 --> 27:08.294
I don't like threats,

27:08.327 --> 27:09.829
and I don't like
to renegotiate

27:09.862 --> 27:12.364
after I've already
delivered services.

27:12.398 --> 27:15.868
I'll deal with Swagger.

27:15.902 --> 27:17.704
It's handled.

27:17.737 --> 27:20.873
You know, that Medal of Honor
email was unnecessary and risky.

27:20.907 --> 27:22.909
I always appreciate
constructive criticism.

27:22.942 --> 27:25.411
[chuckles]
Tell me, is Swagger dead?

27:25.444 --> 27:27.814
ISAAC:
No, even better.

27:27.847 --> 27:29.015
He's gonna confess.

27:29.048 --> 27:30.817
He wants air cover
for his family.

27:30.850 --> 27:32.985
Once he confesses,
there'll be no questions.

27:33.019 --> 27:34.453
It won't matter if he tries
to back out later.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.055
He'll just look crazy.

27:36.088 --> 27:38.324
Either way,
no one will be looking at us.

27:38.357 --> 27:39.892
Well done, Isaac.

27:39.926 --> 27:43.996
I'm getting on a plane.
I'll call you tomorrow.

27:44.030 --> 27:48.868
[phone buzzing]
Yeah?

27:48.901 --> 27:52.438
HUGH: Finish whoever you're
doing. We need to talk.

27:52.471 --> 27:54.006
That's fine.
I can talk.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.174
HUGH: Is your man ready?

27:55.207 --> 27:58.344
He is.
100%.

27:58.377 --> 28:00.346
I need Swagger dead...

28:00.379 --> 28:01.914
now.

28:05.251 --> 28:06.318
[indistinct chatter]

28:06.352 --> 28:07.920
Sir, here you go.
Thank you.

28:07.954 --> 28:10.289
MAN: Yeah?
MAN: Do you have a second?

28:10.322 --> 28:11.858
MAN: I'll be
right with you.

28:11.891 --> 28:13.225
[indistinct chatter]

28:13.259 --> 28:16.495
Agent Johnson,
can I have a word?

28:16.528 --> 28:18.330
Are you here for the briefing?

28:18.364 --> 28:20.800
I'm gonna be here a lot
until this thing wraps up.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.869
I hear that might be soon.

28:22.902 --> 28:26.072
So you got him to confess.
I mean, does his wife know?

28:26.105 --> 28:28.274
You've been in contact
with her?

28:28.307 --> 28:30.442
I tried to pull the security
footage from the library.

28:30.476 --> 28:32.078
It was already erased.

28:32.111 --> 28:35.281
They have limited storage.
It's a local library.

28:35.314 --> 28:36.515
You think you're the only one

28:36.548 --> 28:38.017
who thought Bob Lee
didn't do it?

28:38.050 --> 28:39.819
He was a good Marine.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.988
I had a lot
of respect for him.

28:42.021 --> 28:43.489
Maybe he had me fooled too.

28:43.522 --> 28:45.524
Well...

28:45.557 --> 28:48.360
the wife thinks
someone's pulling the strings,

28:48.394 --> 28:50.830
wants me to go over the evidence
report from their house,

28:50.863 --> 28:52.832
thinks I'm gonna find
someone's phone number.

28:52.865 --> 28:54.901
Mm.
Have you done it?

28:54.934 --> 28:58.504
Not yet,
but this whole thing seems off.

28:58.537 --> 29:01.908
Voydian tries to get me intel
on the Russians' raid in Ukraine

29:01.941 --> 29:03.542
and now the Ukrainian
president is dead?

29:03.575 --> 29:05.377
I mean, there has
to be a connection.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.113
The other version is,
a Marine sniper

29:07.146 --> 29:09.515
with the ability and motive
tried to assassinate

29:09.548 --> 29:12.384
the president
of the United States and missed,

29:12.418 --> 29:14.486
and now he's
gonna confess to it.

29:14.520 --> 29:17.489
Agent Memphis,
do yourself a favor,

29:17.523 --> 29:20.092
take your emotion out of it.

29:20.126 --> 29:22.028
Last time you went
with your gut,

29:22.061 --> 29:24.096
it almost cost you
your career.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.869
Bang.

29:29.902 --> 29:32.471
Ah, there's America's
greatest achievement--

29:32.504 --> 29:36.008
getting their boys
hooked on fake war.

29:36.042 --> 29:38.444
"Call of Duty," my ass.

29:38.477 --> 29:41.080
Knock-knock, assholes.
What is this?

29:41.113 --> 29:42.949
You don't get
to ask any questions, Trotsky.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.050
Up against the wall, come on!

29:44.083 --> 29:47.453
Okay.
Come on!

29:47.486 --> 29:49.021
You two in love yet?
Hmm?

29:49.055 --> 29:50.957
ALEXI: Mr. Raines, we have
a long-standing deal

29:50.990 --> 29:53.492
which you have profited from--
Shut up, old man.

29:53.525 --> 29:55.327
This ain't Moscow.
The only rights you have

29:55.361 --> 29:56.829
are what I grant you,
understand?

29:56.863 --> 29:58.130
Mm-hmm.
You got that?

29:58.164 --> 30:02.068
Found it.
Surprise, surprise, hmm?

30:02.101 --> 30:03.569
Well, look at that.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.571
If you guys are looking
for strap-ons,

30:05.604 --> 30:06.939
I think it's two cells down.

30:06.973 --> 30:08.007
[grunts]

30:08.040 --> 30:09.608
Try that again, Swagger,
please.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.510
Come on.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.846
Don't use the shitter.
I clogged it this morning.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.982
Nothing in this place
ever works.

30:16.015 --> 30:18.150
Hey!

30:18.184 --> 30:19.385
Sweet dreams, huh?

30:19.418 --> 30:21.988
Move it. Let's go.

30:24.891 --> 30:26.558
Come on.
You want some of that?

30:26.592 --> 30:29.095
You ever play these things?

30:29.128 --> 30:31.597
So realistic.
No, man.

30:31.630 --> 30:35.434
Those games are always
too hard for me.

30:35.467 --> 30:38.204
You want me to take rounds?
Sure.

30:38.237 --> 30:40.106
Knock yourself out.

30:40.139 --> 30:42.074
[muttering]
Come on.

30:42.108 --> 30:43.442
Damn it.

30:50.416 --> 30:52.518
We split the bounty.
Good.

30:52.551 --> 30:57.489
Feel free to get messy,
but it needs to happen fast.

30:57.523 --> 31:00.492
[intense music]

31:00.526 --> 31:08.534
*

31:12.939 --> 31:13.973
[lock clicks, door rattles]

31:14.006 --> 31:17.076
New cellmate.

31:17.109 --> 31:19.178
Have fun.

31:32.959 --> 31:35.661
[knife whipping]

31:35.694 --> 31:39.231
Ah!

31:39.265 --> 31:42.434
[grunting]

31:44.703 --> 31:46.572
[grunts]
Ah!

31:46.605 --> 31:49.241
No!

31:49.275 --> 31:51.577
[grunts]

31:51.610 --> 31:54.080
You done yet?

32:13.565 --> 32:16.068
Ahh!

32:20.106 --> 32:21.240
Who sent you?

32:21.273 --> 32:22.308
Get it over with.

32:22.341 --> 32:23.976
I want an exit.

32:24.010 --> 32:25.544
I'm gonna keep cutting pieces

32:25.577 --> 32:27.179
until you tell me
what I need to know.

32:27.213 --> 32:28.180
Ahh!

32:28.214 --> 32:30.049
[gunfire]

32:30.082 --> 32:31.583
What was all that screaming?

32:31.617 --> 32:33.252
Swagger finally start crying?

32:39.558 --> 32:42.561
[electronic beep,
door buzzes]

32:42.594 --> 32:45.564
[intense music]

32:45.597 --> 32:53.605
*

33:31.177 --> 33:32.478
[grunts]

33:39.718 --> 33:42.721
[doorbell rings]

33:45.091 --> 33:46.525
I'm sorry to bother you,
ma'am.

33:46.558 --> 33:48.594
My name is Bob Lee Swagger.

33:48.627 --> 33:49.595
I served with your son.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.097
I know who you are.

33:51.130 --> 33:52.431
I apologize for this,

33:52.464 --> 33:53.832
and you are welcome
to call the police,

33:53.865 --> 33:55.467
but I need your help.

33:59.771 --> 34:01.840
He was gonna confess.
We had a deal.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.375
We had a bad deal.

34:03.409 --> 34:04.676
If he's dead,
the story dies with him.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.145
I mean, what the hell
does it matter?

34:06.178 --> 34:08.447
You were fine with killing him
the first time.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.582
Because killing him at the
assassination was logical.

34:10.616 --> 34:12.684
Killing him in a damn
federal prison was not.

34:12.718 --> 34:15.454
Dead is dead.
This works to our advantage.

34:15.487 --> 34:16.788
He killed an inmate
and prison guard.

34:16.822 --> 34:18.157
One of yours, I assume?

34:18.190 --> 34:19.525
Dead prison guard
means any cop

34:19.558 --> 34:21.127
who sees Swagger
will shoot on sight.

34:21.160 --> 34:22.594
I think he's
figured it out.

34:22.628 --> 34:25.131
He knows we we were
targeting the Ukrainian.

34:25.164 --> 34:26.698
So what?

34:26.732 --> 34:28.567
He only knows you and Payne,

34:28.600 --> 34:30.836
and you two
don't add up to shit.

34:30.869 --> 34:33.205
No offense.
None taken.

34:33.239 --> 34:36.142
Look, you need
to get near the wife.

34:36.175 --> 34:39.878
I think you're making
too many mistakes.

34:39.911 --> 34:43.849
We all make mistakes,
even the brilliant...

34:43.882 --> 34:45.684
Isaac Johnson.

34:48.687 --> 34:51.623
How the hell
did you get this?

34:51.657 --> 34:53.192
If anyone knows
where Swagger will go,

34:53.225 --> 34:54.626
it'll be his wife.

34:54.660 --> 34:58.130
Get her to talk.

34:58.164 --> 35:01.167
Unless you want me
to send Payne.

35:01.200 --> 35:04.203
[indistinct chatter]

35:15.547 --> 35:17.916
Oh, you don't need to worry.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.486
The backyard's fenced.
I'm sorry.

35:20.519 --> 35:24.156
I needed help, and I just didn't
have anybody else to turn to.

35:24.190 --> 35:28.260
That you are here is a great
kindness to my son's memory.

35:28.294 --> 35:30.796
You still trust him,

35:30.829 --> 35:32.531
and he would still trust you.

35:32.564 --> 35:33.665
Yes, ma'am.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.234
I raised him right,

35:35.267 --> 35:37.703
to judge a man
by his actions,

35:37.736 --> 35:39.671
not what others
say about him.

35:39.705 --> 35:42.941
I didn't do what
they said I did.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.810
I was foolish.

35:44.843 --> 35:46.812
I let myself believe I was
the only one that could help.

35:46.845 --> 35:50.182
Well, the devil comes
in many forms,

35:50.216 --> 35:51.683
including pride.

35:51.717 --> 35:54.186
I appreciate...

35:54.220 --> 35:56.755
you remembering
my Donny every year.

35:56.788 --> 35:59.491
He was a good friend...

35:59.525 --> 36:02.194
and a good Marine,
for what it's worth.

36:02.228 --> 36:03.862
It's worth everything.

36:03.895 --> 36:06.232
And he said the same of you.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.601
[grunts]

36:09.635 --> 36:10.702
I need to move
the car out front.

36:10.736 --> 36:11.737
It's gonna draw attention.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.605
I already moved it.

36:13.639 --> 36:14.873
Parked it down the street.

36:14.906 --> 36:16.675
I can't have my neighbors

36:16.708 --> 36:19.211
seeing some strange car
parked in the drive,

36:19.245 --> 36:21.847
coming over asking
all kinds of questions like,

36:21.880 --> 36:24.850
do I have a new boyfriend?

36:24.883 --> 36:26.852
[laughs]

36:26.885 --> 36:29.488
[indistinct chatter]

36:29.521 --> 36:30.589
[eerie music]

36:30.622 --> 36:33.225
Whee.

36:33.259 --> 36:38.530
HOWARD: You wanted back in,
go do your job.

36:38.564 --> 36:40.632
Sure you don't want
another female agent?

36:40.666 --> 36:43.269
Just take yes
for an answer, Nadine.

36:43.302 --> 36:47.906
*

36:47.939 --> 36:49.308
MARY: [murmurs indistinctly]

36:49.341 --> 36:52.010
She seems
completely unaffected.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.979
We're very close.

36:54.012 --> 36:57.616
She's used to her
father coming and going.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.651
Hey.

36:59.685 --> 37:03.255
I could've fought the email,
but a confession?

37:03.289 --> 37:05.524
He's making a pretty convincing
case of his guilt.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.259
He would only do that
to protect us.

37:07.293 --> 37:09.995
Then why run?

37:10.028 --> 37:12.664
If you have any idea
where he is,

37:12.698 --> 37:15.734
then please tell me
so I can bring him in unharmed.

37:15.767 --> 37:18.670
If I knew, I would.

37:18.704 --> 37:20.272
You guys have been
around me constantly.

37:20.306 --> 37:22.341
I haven't talked
to my husband since it happened.

37:22.374 --> 37:25.644
I think I got something--
credit card receipts.

37:25.677 --> 37:28.980
He sent flowers every year
on the same day--June 10th.

37:29.014 --> 37:31.016
What's June 10th?
My mother's birthday.

37:31.049 --> 37:33.051
Where does your mother live?

37:33.084 --> 37:34.653
Find out who lives
at this address.

37:34.686 --> 37:37.823
Get everyone.
Let's go, now!

37:37.856 --> 37:39.691
[dramatic music]

37:39.725 --> 37:41.693
WOMAN: Uh, can we get
that K-9 unit, K-9 unit,

37:41.727 --> 37:42.994
uh, back out...

37:43.028 --> 37:44.596
We're leaving
the residence now.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.965
We got a line on Swagger.

37:46.998 --> 37:50.035
Go get geared up!

37:50.068 --> 37:51.803
Where you headed?
I think we got him.

37:51.837 --> 37:54.005
He sent flowers every year
to the mom of his dead spotter.

37:54.039 --> 37:55.941
Donny Fenn.
I know the family.

37:55.974 --> 37:57.776
Howard,
this man has been trained

37:57.809 --> 37:59.378
in virtually every field
of recon.

37:59.411 --> 38:02.080
He hears a helicopter,
sees a federal car, he's gone.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.315
My team is in the field.

38:03.349 --> 38:04.683
They can recon him, identify,

38:04.716 --> 38:06.017
send up the flare.

38:06.051 --> 38:07.853
Your team can make
the arrest.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.823
Mrs. Fenn, I can't.

38:11.857 --> 38:13.925
I paid off the house.
I gave some to the church.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.894
And this is what's left
of his death benefit.

38:15.927 --> 38:17.396
No, ma'am.
Take it.

38:17.429 --> 38:20.732
Donny would never forgive me
if I didn't.

38:22.901 --> 38:25.604
[vehicle approaching]

38:25.637 --> 38:27.373
Same car has passed
three times.

38:27.406 --> 38:28.807
They know I'm here.

38:28.840 --> 38:31.410
How long do we have?
Five minutes, maybe.

38:31.443 --> 38:32.844
Go out the back.

38:32.878 --> 38:34.112
In the garage
is Donny's motorcycle

38:34.145 --> 38:35.747
and his field box.

38:35.781 --> 38:37.015
I'll keep them away
as long as I can.

38:37.048 --> 38:38.684
All right, tell them--
tell them I forced you.

38:38.717 --> 38:40.419
Tell them I had a gun.

38:40.452 --> 38:43.689
[intense music]

38:43.722 --> 38:45.824
As soon as we ID him,
we'll call in the cavalry.

38:45.857 --> 38:48.727
Nobody contact the FBI
until I'm sure he's there.

38:48.760 --> 38:56.768
*

39:09.180 --> 39:12.384
[doorbell rings]

39:14.119 --> 39:16.922
Mrs. Fenn.

39:16.955 --> 39:19.057
Yes.

39:19.090 --> 39:22.027
My name is Isaac Johnson.
I served with your son.

39:22.060 --> 39:25.030
I'm looking
for Bob Lee Swagger.

39:25.063 --> 39:27.666
Who?

39:27.699 --> 39:28.934
[metal can clangs]

39:28.967 --> 39:30.902
Sh--

39:30.936 --> 39:33.071
Wait, you can't
just go back there!

39:33.104 --> 39:41.112

[woman humming melodically]

40:30.195 --> 40:35.133
[phone buzzing]

40:35.166 --> 40:36.234
Yes.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.837
BOB LEE:
Hey, babe.

40:38.870 --> 40:40.739
G--

40:40.772 --> 40:43.842
You have no idea how long
I've waited to hear your voice.

40:43.875 --> 40:46.177
BOB LEE: I'm sorry, Julie,
for all of it.

40:46.211 --> 40:49.114
No, don't you dare.

40:49.147 --> 40:51.850
None of this is your fault,
not even a little.

40:51.883 --> 40:54.252
How's my kitten-mouse?

40:54.285 --> 40:56.121
Good.

40:56.154 --> 40:57.956
She misses her papa.

40:57.989 --> 40:59.825
BOB LEE:
I miss her too.

40:59.858 --> 41:03.595
They treating you okay?

41:03.629 --> 41:07.999
Yeah, they're, uh, doing
their job, I suppose.

41:08.033 --> 41:10.001
Sweetie, you just got
to live your life.

41:10.035 --> 41:12.904
JULIE: That's gonna be hard
with the circus in town.

41:12.938 --> 41:15.206
I wish you were here.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.876
*

41:17.909 --> 41:20.078
Probably pretty crowded
about now, I'm guessing.

41:20.111 --> 41:22.514
I better go.

41:22.548 --> 41:26.084
Bob Lee, what are you...

41:26.117 --> 41:27.586
what are you gonna do?

41:27.619 --> 41:30.889
I'm gonna do what I do best.

41:30.922 --> 41:32.524
I'm gonna hunt.

41:32.558 --> 41:35.126
CHOIR: * No more
