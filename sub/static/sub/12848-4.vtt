WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:02.634
No justice, no peace!

00:02.636 --> 00:04.403
We're in front of the courthouse

00:04.405 --> 00:07.406
as crowds await the verdict
on Steven Benedict,

00:07.408 --> 00:10.342
the 45-year-old white male
on trial for shooting

00:10.344 --> 00:13.212
an African-American man
six months ago.

00:13.214 --> 00:16.280
This man is no "highway hero"!

00:16.283 --> 00:18.417
He is a "roadside racist"!

00:20.437 --> 00:22.454
We want justice,
and we want it now!

00:22.456 --> 00:24.690
No justice, no peace!

00:24.692 --> 00:26.492
No justice, no peace!

00:26.494 --> 00:29.028
No justice, no peace!

00:29.030 --> 00:31.697
Everybody,
this is Dr. T.C. Callahan.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.466
Doc is an ex-ranger
and combat vet,

00:34.468 --> 00:36.502
so he's not gonna wet his pants

00:36.504 --> 00:38.070
if things get a little hairy
out there.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.572
I brought my diapers,
so no promises.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.508
In all seriousness,
post-San Bernardino,

00:42.510 --> 00:44.276
we've been recruiting ER docs

00:44.278 --> 00:46.779
so that we've got medical
personnel with us on-scene.

00:46.781 --> 00:48.213
Nice to have you, doc.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.616
Let's just keep everybody safe.

00:50.618 --> 00:51.683
Yes, sir.

00:53.454 --> 00:54.820
That's five minutes from here.

00:56.524 --> 00:57.790
Heading out right away.

00:57.792 --> 01:00.225
We got an officer-related
shooting nearby.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.727
Gear up!

01:01.729 --> 01:03.045
That didn't take long.

01:03.046 --> 01:04.361
Never does.
Let's move!

01:07.268 --> 01:09.435
Nice bling, Paris Hilton.

01:09.437 --> 01:12.271
A gift from my dad... you know,
for switching to surgery.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.406
Ooh!

01:13.407 --> 01:14.540
Well, when I started
my residency,

01:14.542 --> 01:16.208
my mom bought me a used iron.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.443
<i>No justice, no peace!</i>

01:17.445 --> 01:18.677
Oh, is this the verdict?
Shh, shh.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.145
<i>Breaking news.</i>

01:20.147 --> 01:21.613
<i>The verdict
in the Steven Benedict trial</i>

01:21.615 --> 01:24.116
<i>will have to wait,
as he's collapsed in court.</i>

01:24.118 --> 01:25.684
<i>No word on his condition.</i>

01:25.686 --> 01:27.419
Can you believe that?

01:27.421 --> 01:29.655
Kenny, thanks for joining us.
Almost forgot you worked here.

01:29.657 --> 01:30.890
Please get ready.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.124
Sorry. Sorry.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.192
Hello?

01:33.194 --> 01:34.193
Yeah.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.228
Topher's pissed?
Yeah.

01:36.230 --> 01:38.430
I mean, you know he wanted all hands
on deck when the verdict came down.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.798
Yeah, well, tell that to the cop

01:39.800 --> 01:41.500
that stopped to question me
for 30 minutes.

01:41.502 --> 01:42.835
Why'd he stop you?

01:42.837 --> 01:45.637
Speeding. 30 in a 25.
Bunch of BS.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.739
I mean, technically,
that <i> is</i> speeding.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.174
More like dwb.

01:49.175 --> 01:50.608
How is that driving while black?

01:50.611 --> 01:53.412
You just admitted to speeding.

01:53.414 --> 01:56.748
I was going 30 in a 25...
No faster than anybody else,

01:56.750 --> 01:58.317
but I'm the one
that got ticketed.

01:58.319 --> 02:00.319
All right. I'm just saying
I've never been stopped.

02:03.157 --> 02:04.423
Well, maybe that's because

02:04.424 --> 02:05.690
you driving that beemer
daddy got you.

02:05.693 --> 02:07.559
Got a... got a cardigan
tied around your neck

02:07.561 --> 02:09.461
and a tennis-club
bumper sticker on the back.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.730
Yes. Yes, sir. W-we'll take care
of it. Thank you.

02:11.732 --> 02:13.398
Kenny, come back here.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.900
All right, people,
I have the D.A.,

02:14.902 --> 02:17.503
the chief of police, and the
governor up my ass about this.

02:17.505 --> 02:20.672
Steven Benedict <i> is</i> coming to us.
He's just a few minutes away.

02:20.674 --> 02:23.542
Jordan, he's yours.
Get him medically cleared ASAP.

02:23.544 --> 02:24.643
Kenny, you help.

02:24.644 --> 02:25.743
I-I still got to change, man.
Can I just...

02:25.746 --> 02:27.513
Kenny, we're short-staffed.

02:27.515 --> 02:30.716
I need my best people getting
him worked up and back to jail.

02:30.718 --> 02:31.750
Please, get on it!

02:31.752 --> 02:33.552
Fine. Thank you,
Dr. Zia. Yes.

02:33.554 --> 02:35.454
What the...
I think he's having a bad day.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.056
Yeah, well,
that makes two of us.

02:37.057 --> 02:38.657
I don't want this guy
coming here. It's distracting.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.759
Everybody has an opinion
about the case.

02:40.761 --> 02:43.262
I don't want it interfering
with the work.

02:43.264 --> 02:45.531
Don't worry.
We'll take care of it.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.632
I-I got to
talk to security.

02:46.634 --> 02:48.200
Word gets out he's coming here,

02:48.202 --> 02:49.535
this place is gonna be
a madhouse.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.370
So, we're getting the...
The "highway hero"?

02:51.372 --> 02:52.704
Hero? Please.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.339
He murdered the guy
in cold blood.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.175
No, no, no. He shot a guy
who was gonna kill him.

02:56.177 --> 02:57.576
And when you get attacked,
you can either run

02:57.578 --> 02:58.944
or you can fight,
and he couldn't run.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.095
We don't know that.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.245
All right.
You know what?

03:01.248 --> 03:02.781
Let's keep the politics
out of the ER tonight.

03:02.783 --> 03:05.484
All right?
It's gonna be busy.

03:05.486 --> 03:06.652
Hey.
Hmm?

03:06.654 --> 03:08.204
Is Rick on duty tonight?

03:08.205 --> 03:09.755
Uh, no. He's training
the Houston SWAT all week.

03:09.757 --> 03:11.557
T.C.'s out there, though.
Of course.

03:11.559 --> 03:14.293
He was one of the first doctors
to sign up for San Antonio SWAT.

03:14.295 --> 03:15.561
Only because
I was in Afghanistan.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.196
Okay, you know what?

03:17.198 --> 03:18.530
You can put
the measuring tape away.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.832
We all know
you got a big one, too.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.334
Feel free to say that louder.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.474
Steven Benedict...
45, healthy.

03:29.476 --> 03:31.777
Status post an atraumatic
syncopal episode in court.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.579
Denies chest pains
or focal weakness.

03:33.581 --> 03:34.747
Vitals?

03:34.748 --> 03:35.914
Stable.
A and O times three.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.483
Slightly decreased blood sugar
on-scene to 55.

03:38.485 --> 03:39.952
All right,
let's get him to trauma 1.

03:39.954 --> 03:41.720
How are you feeling,
Mr. Benedict?

03:41.722 --> 03:43.989
I don't... I don't know
why I fainted.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.691
<i>I</i> do...
About to be found guilty.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.826
Kenny!
About Mr. Benedict's medical condition?

03:47.828 --> 03:48.927
Whoa, whoa. Check with
the sheriff's department.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.696
We're just here to treat him.

03:50.697 --> 03:52.464
One statement. Anything.
Okay. Here's a statement.

03:52.465 --> 03:54.625
Anybody steps through the door,
we're calling the cops.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.338
Move it! Make a hole!

03:59.340 --> 03:59.938
Doctor coming in!

03:59.940 --> 04:01.740
Hey! Hey! Let's go!

04:01.742 --> 04:03.012
Let's go, doc! You got
to help my partner!

04:03.036 --> 04:03.542
On it. On it.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.077
What happened?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.611
Well, we got separated
investigating a call

04:06.614 --> 04:07.713
about somebody with a gun.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.314
Next thing you know,
I heard shots,

04:09.316 --> 04:11.316
and David was returning fire
when I got there.

04:11.318 --> 04:13.919
He was down, and I unloaded
two rounds into the Vic.

04:13.921 --> 04:17.623
Damn it. Missed his vest.
Sounds like a collapsed lung.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.108
Well, then fix it!

04:19.108 --> 04:20.591
I'm on it, okay?
There's one of me, two of them.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.761
Let me do my job and triage.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.696
Hey, is this
absolutely necessary?

04:24.698 --> 04:26.598
He's under arrest!
He shot a cop!

04:26.600 --> 04:28.734
Well, he's gonna die
if I can't treat him properly.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.569
Hey, look,
there's five of you, okay?

04:30.571 --> 04:32.537
Just look after him.
Uncuff him. Now!

04:33.641 --> 04:36.642
Gsws, right upper quadrant.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.194
Okay, buddy.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.745
Just need you to hold that
right there, okay?

04:39.747 --> 04:41.063
All right.
You got it?

04:41.064 --> 04:42.380
Am I gonna die?

04:42.383 --> 04:44.283
No, no, no. 'Course not.
We're not gonna let that happen.

04:44.285 --> 04:45.784
It's okay.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.519
Okay.
They're both critical.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.654
We need to load them up
in an ambulance,

04:48.656 --> 04:49.721
get them to the hospital
right away.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.740
That ship has sailed, doc.

04:51.741 --> 04:53.758
Things are escalating fast.
Word's out on the shooting.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.627
Hey, he pulled on <i> us!</i>
It isn't one of those!

04:55.629 --> 04:57.362
Look, I'm just telling you
the situation.

04:57.364 --> 04:58.764
We're not getting out of here
in a vehicle right now.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.149
There's already rioters
blocking the roads.

05:00.150 --> 05:01.533
Okay, we'll bring in
the chopper, all right?

05:01.535 --> 05:02.501
We got to transport now.

05:02.503 --> 05:03.736
It's not available yet.

05:03.737 --> 05:04.970
It's responding to a call
outside the city.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.505
It's gonna be about 20 minutes.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.073
No, that's too long.
I don't have 20 minutes.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.808
I can't look after two criticals
on my own.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.410
Okay. You can't get us
out of here.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.344
Can you get doctors here?

05:12.346 --> 05:13.645
I can probably make it work.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.747
Okay, I need you to call
San Antonio memorial

05:15.749 --> 05:17.725
and tell them we need Dr.
Scott Clemmens ASAP.

05:17.750 --> 05:18.383
Got it.

05:18.385 --> 05:20.419
Hang in there, buddy.
We got you. We got you.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.754
Okay.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.022
Thank you.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.658
Yo, man, not cool calling me out

05:26.660 --> 05:28.627
in front of everyone
about my car.

05:28.629 --> 05:29.979
Calling you out?

05:29.980 --> 05:31.330
Look, I was getting my ass
chewed out

05:31.332 --> 05:33.332
for being late
because I got pulled over.

05:33.334 --> 05:34.633
And you're all, like,

05:34.635 --> 05:35.867
"well, technically,
you were speeding."

05:35.869 --> 05:37.436
I made an observation,
all right?

05:37.438 --> 05:39.838
Yeah, I made one, too, man.
You living in a bubble.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.474
Hey, man. I-i lived in Philly
for eight years. I'm not blind.

05:42.476 --> 05:43.542
I just don't think
everybody's out trying to get me

05:43.544 --> 05:45.010
because of my color.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.477
Hey, I don't think everybody's
out trying to get me, either.

05:46.478 --> 05:47.944
Okay? So don't go
all trump on me.

05:47.945 --> 05:49.411
But going to Ivy league Penn,

05:49.416 --> 05:51.116
staying in that condo
daddy got you,

05:51.118 --> 05:52.818
ain't "living in Philly," bro.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.823
Hey. Paul. Let's go.
You're coming with me.

05:57.825 --> 05:58.824
Keep him npo?
Okay.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.792
T.C.'s got two gsws.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.661
One of them's a cop,
the other one's a kid.

06:02.663 --> 06:04.563
They're both critical,
and he can't get in.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.365
The streets are all blocked
with protestors.

06:06.367 --> 06:07.432
We...
We're going out there?

06:07.434 --> 06:08.734
Yeah. Let's go.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.739
Okay, so, you say
you've never fainted before?

06:13.741 --> 06:15.574
No, never.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.743
But I'm not faking it.
I swear.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.878
I really don't feel very well.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.713
I believe you,
but if you keep talking,

06:21.715 --> 06:23.048
I can't listen to your heart.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.119
I don't hate black people.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.723
Interesting way
to start a conversation.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.525
Well, because I see
the way you look at me,

06:33.527 --> 06:37.162
and I need you to know
that I'm not what they say I am.

06:37.164 --> 06:38.830
And who is "they"?

06:38.832 --> 06:39.865
The media.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.867
This is all their fault.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.018
Mm.<i> They're</i> the ones
that shot that black guy.

06:43.019 --> 06:44.168
All this time,
I thought that was you.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.705
Kenny, please.
No, it's okay.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.607
I want to talk about this.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.876
So, you think
that I'm just some racist

06:50.878 --> 06:53.478
who shot a man
because he was black?

06:54.782 --> 06:56.748
I was afraid for my life.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.650
Hey, I guess that worked
for George Zimmerman,

06:58.652 --> 07:00.219
so why not?

07:00.220 --> 07:01.787
Oh, come on.
You <i> cannot</i> compare the two.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.822
I'm not some nutjob
who's out looking for a fight.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.424
You had a loaded weapon.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.025
You saw someone who didn't fit
in your neighborhood.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.627
No, my car broke down.

07:08.629 --> 07:09.728
I was waiting for a tow,

07:09.730 --> 07:11.096
and he kept banging
at my window.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.864
Eight shots into that man.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.834
Eight shots.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.436
He just kept coming!

07:17.438 --> 07:19.171
Okay, you know what?
Enough. Both of you.

07:19.173 --> 07:20.839
You've had your debate.
We are done.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.707
Right now, let's focus
on what's going on

07:22.709 --> 07:24.142
with Mr. Benedict,
all right?

07:24.144 --> 07:26.845
Kenny, please, will you take
this blood to the lab

07:26.847 --> 07:28.013
and order an X-ray?

07:33.854 --> 07:36.521
Don't be mad at him.
I'm used to it.

07:36.523 --> 07:38.824
Every black person in the city
hates me now.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.225
But I'm not faking it.

07:40.227 --> 07:42.761
There is something
wrong with me.

07:42.763 --> 07:43.962
Okay.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.162
We've seen it
on the streets of New York.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.032
We've seen it
on the streets of St. Louis.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.500
Now we're seeing it
in San Antonio!

07:48.502 --> 07:50.736
What are we gonna do?

07:50.737 --> 07:52.971
The systems of inequality
need to stop in this country!

07:55.075 --> 07:57.075
We are tired of this!

07:57.077 --> 07:59.110
Hey, here they come!
Look out! Look out!

07:59.112 --> 08:01.546
Look at them!
They don't even care about us!

08:03.884 --> 08:05.584
What are we gonna do, huh?

08:05.586 --> 08:06.586
We're gonna stop them.

08:08.000 --> 08:14.074

08:30.878 --> 08:32.210
Move!

08:36.517 --> 08:37.782
This is as far
as the ambulance will go!

08:37.784 --> 08:39.618
You got to get out now!

08:39.620 --> 08:41.520
Back them up! Back them up!

08:45.058 --> 08:46.124
Put these on.

08:47.261 --> 08:48.693
Which way?
Four blocks this way.

08:48.695 --> 08:49.694
We'll take you
the rest of the way.

08:49.696 --> 08:51.630
Move!

09:24.097 --> 09:25.163
You guys okay?

09:25.165 --> 09:26.097
Yeah. Paul?

09:26.099 --> 09:27.199
I-I guess.

09:27.200 --> 09:28.300
Hey, he's got a hot abdomen.

09:28.302 --> 09:30.235
Probably lost
three or four liters in there.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.572
Let's get him down.
Yeah.

09:36.343 --> 09:39.244
I'll run a central line
to transfuse.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.645
Here's the blood.

09:40.647 --> 09:41.646
Okay.

09:41.648 --> 09:42.814
Ready?
Take it easy.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.716
We're here to help, okay?
I'm Paul.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.284
I didn't do anything.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.886
Why is this happening?

09:47.888 --> 09:49.554
I don't know.

09:49.555 --> 09:51.235
But I need you
to hang in there, all right?

09:53.360 --> 09:55.193
They just shot me.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.995
I was working.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.330
Why'd they shoot me?

09:58.332 --> 09:59.998
Paul! I need cricoid!

10:00.000 --> 10:02.067
His cords are way anterior!

10:02.069 --> 10:03.068
Yeah. Okay.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.302
Come on, buddy.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.171
Don't leave me.

10:06.172 --> 10:08.039
I'll be right back.
I promise.

10:08.040 --> 10:08.528
It's okay.

10:08.553 --> 10:09.907
We're gonna get you to
the hospital real soon.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.676
David? David,
you're gonna be okay.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.044
I'm right here.
I'm not leaving you.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.245
There we go.
There we go.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.131
What's the update?

10:16.132 --> 10:18.016
The chopper's close, but we're
having trouble containing the rioting.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.618
Wind's blowing tear gas
everywhere.

10:19.620 --> 10:20.869
Tear gas?

10:20.870 --> 10:22.119
Just added fuel to the fire.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.723
Itchy fingers. Some rookie
in the line panicked.

10:24.725 --> 10:26.324
Okay, got it.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.325
Thanks, Paul.

10:27.327 --> 10:28.810
<i>As you can see...</i>

10:28.811 --> 10:30.294
It's getting bad out there.
They're using tear gas.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.997
Better than bullets.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.798
Mr. Sanchez?

10:36.003 --> 10:39.671
Okay, nurse, take Mr. Sanchez
to trauma 4 for suturing.

10:39.673 --> 10:40.972
Nice work
on that hematoma block.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.208
Thanks. I've never reduced
a boxer's fracture before.

10:43.210 --> 10:45.243
Yeah, uh, Toph, broken hand
in curtain 2 is reduced,

10:45.245 --> 10:47.012
splinted, ready to go.
Thank goodness.

10:47.014 --> 10:49.314
Patients are flooding in,
and we're running out of beds.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.832
And I'm thinking...

10:50.833 --> 10:52.349
<i>I'm standing outside
San Antonio memorial,</i>

10:52.352 --> 10:54.853
<i>where it has just been
confirmed that Steven Benedict</i>

10:54.855 --> 10:56.688
<i>is still being evaluated
by doctors.</i>

10:56.690 --> 10:58.123
<i>He collapsed...</i>
Son of a...

10:58.125 --> 10:59.724
This place is gonna get swarmed.

10:59.726 --> 11:01.660
Is Jordan still working
on that guy?

11:01.662 --> 11:02.761
Last I heard.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.580
Oh, cool.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.398
Look, she's doing the report
right in our ambulance bay.

11:06.400 --> 11:07.900
Yeah, no, not cool.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.401
Hey, security,
let's get them out of here.

11:09.403 --> 11:11.403
Guys!

11:11.404 --> 11:13.404
You can't block this doorway!
This is a hospital!

11:13.407 --> 11:14.890
19-year-old male,
coughing spasms

11:14.891 --> 11:16.374
and shortness of breath
from tear gas exposure.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.709
Stats are stable.

11:17.710 --> 11:19.043
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:19.044 --> 11:20.377
No, you can't bring him in here.

11:20.378 --> 11:21.711
Sara, Sara, he has to be
decontaminated outside,

11:21.715 --> 11:23.582
so go on...
We'll meet you there.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.450
Okay, but FYI, there's a bunch
of these heading your way.

11:25.452 --> 11:28.270
Okay. Drew... yeah, yeah.
On it. On it.

11:28.271 --> 11:29.754
Shannon, you ever set up
a decontamination tent?

11:29.756 --> 11:31.076
No, but I'm guessing
I'm about to.

11:36.463 --> 11:37.896
Equal breath sounds.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.464
Symmetrical chest rise.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.366
Okay, good.
He's secure.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.768
First unit's almost done.

11:43.770 --> 11:45.170
BP's coming up.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.939
See, Sean?

11:46.940 --> 11:48.707
I told you...
We're gonna help you out.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.259
I don't want to die.

11:50.260 --> 11:51.810
You won't, okay?
It's almost over.

11:51.812 --> 11:54.379
The chopper's landing
around the corner.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.381
We can only fit one at a time.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.383
Okay, well,
they both got to go <i> now.</i>

11:58.385 --> 12:00.218
David's going first.
He's a cop.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.486
That's not how we do things,
okay?

12:01.488 --> 12:03.722
We go based on
who's in the worst condition.

12:03.724 --> 12:05.190
That guy shot David!
He's not going first!

12:05.192 --> 12:06.491
He said he didn't do anything.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.293
- They all say that!
- All right, stop!

12:08.295 --> 12:10.095
Paul, come here.
Take over.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.768
This is a medical decision.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.837
The officer is stable
now that he's been intubated,

12:18.839 --> 12:20.905
but this kid's
got a belly full of blood.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.574
Okay. Scott?

12:22.575 --> 12:24.242
His pressure's up since
the transfusion. He can wait.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.778
If one of the bullets
in this cop's chest hit his heart,

12:26.780 --> 12:28.113
he could code at any second.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.598
He's gotta go first.

12:29.599 --> 12:31.082
The roads
will be cleared in 10 minutes.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.817
Get officer Gallik
in the chopper.

12:32.819 --> 12:34.252
The kid can follow
in the ambulance.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.825
We got to make
a decision here, Scott.

12:40.827 --> 12:42.026
Your kid is still transfusing.

12:42.028 --> 12:43.528
Which we could do
in the chopper!

12:43.530 --> 12:45.096
Paul, I've had to
make the decision

12:45.098 --> 12:46.364
a hundred times in combat.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.532
Have <i> you?</i>

12:47.534 --> 12:49.400
I know it sucks, okay?

12:49.402 --> 12:50.869
But somebody's got to go first.

12:50.871 --> 12:51.803
It's got to be the officer.

12:51.805 --> 12:54.072
Let's saddle up!

12:54.074 --> 12:55.440
Okay.
Hey.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.876
If this kid bleeds out,
it's on <i> you.</i>

12:57.878 --> 13:00.111
I know. I know.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.547
Okay, you set?
On three. One, two...

13:02.549 --> 13:05.784
They shot <i> me,</i>
and <i> I</i> have to stay?

13:05.786 --> 13:07.552
They said
you shot at them first.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.120
And you believe them?

13:09.122 --> 13:11.322
I was just defending myself.

13:11.324 --> 13:12.524
They shot at me.

13:12.526 --> 13:14.459
I didn't know they were cops.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.860
It's crazy out here.

13:15.862 --> 13:18.363
I-I don't know.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.565
I-I'm a doctor.
I just want to fix you.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.067
Then you should have taken me first.

13:23.069 --> 13:25.570
This is for your pain,
and it's gonna help you sleep.

13:25.572 --> 13:28.840
We're gonna have you out of here
in 10, 15 minutes.

13:28.842 --> 13:30.692
It's gonna be okay.

13:30.693 --> 13:32.543
Yeah.
For <i> you.</i>

13:40.086 --> 13:41.886
Move out! Move out!

13:41.888 --> 13:44.589
We got to get him
out of here now!

13:47.828 --> 13:49.461
So, there's nothing
wrong with him?

13:49.462 --> 13:51.095
Well, not necessarily. I still
have a few tests pending.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.397
I appreciate you being thorough,

13:52.399 --> 13:54.165
but we have a waiting room
full of patients.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.367
Get his tests.
Get him out of here.

13:56.369 --> 13:58.119
Hey, look whose bloodwork showed

13:58.120 --> 13:59.870
that there's absolutely nothing
wrong with him.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.389
So now we have our answer.

14:01.390 --> 14:02.906
There's nothing emergent
about his condition.

14:02.909 --> 14:04.108
He can be treated by a jail doc.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.527
Sign him out.

14:05.528 --> 14:06.945
I'm... Not sure.
I...

14:06.947 --> 14:08.513
You're not sure?
No.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.515
I think that there might actually
be something wrong with him.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.017
Topher, he's faking it.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.518
Look, the guy's buying time
because he knows

14:13.520 --> 14:15.320
he's about to spend
the rest of his life in prison

14:15.322 --> 14:17.522
with a bunch of those black
people he says he doesn't hate.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.957
Except this time, no gun.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.959
Jordan, his tests are all normal.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.194
He fainted right before
he was gonna be sentenced.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.129
I think it's pretty clear
what's going on.

14:25.131 --> 14:27.611
I'd probably fake something, too.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.234
Yeah?

14:29.236 --> 14:30.902
Okay. Hold on.

14:30.904 --> 14:34.172
Listen up! T.C. Is on his way
with the downed officer!

14:34.174 --> 14:36.641
A <i> lot</i> more causalities
are headed this way.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.610
Get Benedict out of here.
Start treating new patients.

14:38.612 --> 14:40.412
Yeah, I need...
I need an estimate.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.213
All right. I'll go tell
the sheriff to take him back...

14:42.215 --> 14:43.581
No, not yet.

14:43.582 --> 14:44.948
But Topher just said that...

14:44.951 --> 14:46.951
<i>My</i> patient, not his.

14:46.953 --> 14:48.419
Why are you defending this guy?

14:48.421 --> 14:50.455
I'm not defending him.
I'm treating him.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.490
Yeah, treating him like a V.I.P.
You know what he did.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.026
I know what he's <i> accused</i> of.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.361
So you think he's innocent?

14:56.363 --> 14:58.330
I-I don't know.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.298
I haven't followed the case
that closely.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.634
I understand that this is
personal for you, but sometimes,

15:02.636 --> 15:03.935
as a medical professional,
you have to...

15:03.937 --> 15:05.236
Personal?

15:05.238 --> 15:10.141
Look, people like that...
That superior attitude,

15:10.143 --> 15:13.278
Th-that eye that looks down
at me without even knowing me...

15:13.280 --> 15:15.546
Now, I've dealt with that
my entire life.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.181
I mean, do you know
what it feels like

15:17.183 --> 15:19.183
to get on an elevator
with a white lady all alone

15:19.185 --> 15:21.586
and to see her ever so subtly
clench her purse

15:21.588 --> 15:23.321
just because
you're standing there?

15:23.323 --> 15:27.058
To have to almost apologize for
being a big, strong black guy?

15:27.060 --> 15:30.395
Turn on the... the smile
and the charm just because...

15:30.397 --> 15:32.463
Just because you can see
the fear in her face,

15:32.465 --> 15:35.166
Th-the suspicion
in her eyes?

15:37.470 --> 15:39.504
Now, is it my responsibility

15:39.506 --> 15:42.707
to go out of my way
to make her feel at ease?

15:42.709 --> 15:46.077
Or is it her job not
to make assumptions about me?

15:47.480 --> 15:49.681
You see, these are
the things that I deal with

15:49.683 --> 15:51.282
on a daily basis.

15:52.452 --> 15:55.987
Now, I know
you're a good person.

15:55.989 --> 15:58.156
Jordan, we're family.
That's undeniable.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.724
But please
don't get pissed at me

15:59.726 --> 16:01.693
for not going above and beyond
my job for this guy

16:01.695 --> 16:03.027
the way that you do.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.729
I'm not pissed at you.

16:04.731 --> 16:07.498
Okay, I just think that...
What?!

16:11.705 --> 16:13.371
Forget it. Okay?

16:13.372 --> 16:15.038
I just...
I don't want to get into it.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.975
What? No. I want to hear
what you got to say.

16:16.977 --> 16:21.012
Okay, uh... Aren't you doing
the same thing?

16:21.014 --> 16:24.015
You know, making assumptions,
calling him "Zimmerman"?

16:24.017 --> 16:26.017
You weren't there.
You don't know what happened.

16:26.019 --> 16:28.052
Yeah, but the only other person
that <i> was</i> is dead.

16:28.054 --> 16:30.522
Yeah, but that guy...

16:30.523 --> 16:32.991
He's been arrested for assault
multiple times.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.459
How did Benedict know that?

16:34.461 --> 16:35.777
Huh?

16:35.778 --> 16:37.094
What did he do,
pull up his police report

16:37.097 --> 16:38.597
right there on the spot

16:38.598 --> 16:40.098
before he decided
to shoot him eight times?

16:40.100 --> 16:41.532
Fair enough.

16:41.534 --> 16:44.002
Look, all I am trying
to say to you

16:44.004 --> 16:46.070
is that I understand his fear.

16:46.072 --> 16:48.439
And not because the guy that
he shot was black, all right?

16:48.441 --> 16:51.059
You know that.

16:51.060 --> 16:53.678
I'm saying I... I understand
that vulnerability.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.214
You know, when I had a stalker,
I went out and I bought a gun.

16:56.216 --> 16:59.617
Yeah, but you never used it,
Jordan.

16:59.619 --> 17:03.187
No, but... To be perfectly
honest with you,

17:03.189 --> 17:04.756
if it were me stranded
on the side of the road

17:04.758 --> 17:06.790
in the middle of the night
in my broken-down car

17:06.792 --> 17:09.027
and some guy... I don't care
if he's black or white...

17:09.029 --> 17:11.561
Starts banging on my door
and I felt threatened

17:11.564 --> 17:15.599
and I feared for my life,
then, yeah, all right?

17:15.602 --> 17:18.169
I-I think I would shoot.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.709
Well, then remind me
to never bang on your window.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.994
Kenny, I didn't mean...

17:26.996 --> 17:29.356
Dr. Alexander, Mr. Benedict
is complaining about a migraine.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.683
I'll be right there.

17:34.087 --> 17:35.320
It's gonna be okay, buddy.

17:35.321 --> 17:36.554
We're almost there.
You're doing great.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.089
Sean?

17:38.091 --> 17:39.908
Sean, stay with us!

17:39.909 --> 17:41.726
BP's down to 82.
Something must have opened up.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.528
Damn it, I knew
we should have gone first.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.496
Hey, Paul, stay focused
on what we can do now.

17:45.498 --> 17:46.831
Sean needs the OR.

17:46.832 --> 17:48.232
Let's just get him
to the ambulance.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.703
You kidding me?!

17:52.705 --> 17:54.272
Really?

17:54.274 --> 17:56.207
What the hell
are we gonna do now?

17:59.112 --> 18:01.272
We're gonna have to find
someplace to operate out here.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.287
T.C. Damn tear gas.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.422
That stuff stings pretty bad.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.558
No, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.692
How's he doing?

18:14.694 --> 18:16.194
Not good.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.362
He's gonna need surgery
as soon as he gets in.

18:18.364 --> 18:20.098
He's just a kid.

18:20.100 --> 18:22.467
He only joined the force
about three months ago.

18:22.469 --> 18:25.103
Guy... guy barely shaves.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.771
Yeah, I don't think
the other kid does, either.

18:26.773 --> 18:28.339
Well, that kid fired on us.

18:28.341 --> 18:29.474
We didn't have a choice.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.109
You think I feel good
about that?

18:31.111 --> 18:32.444
Nobody does!

18:32.445 --> 18:33.778
I had to leave a patient
back there.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.347
I hate doing that.
Okay?

18:36.349 --> 18:39.383
Well, you were right
to take David.

18:39.385 --> 18:42.120
Yeah.
Line of duty comes first.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.693
Hey, buddy. Bad news.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.128
The on-call surgeon,
Dr. Clegg,

18:50.130 --> 18:52.196
is stuck across town
in riot traffic.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.498
<i>He's not gonna make it
for another hour.</i>

18:53.500 --> 18:54.866
No, h-he doesn't
have an hour, Toph.

18:54.868 --> 18:56.200
<i>He's got to go
straight to OR now.</i>

18:56.202 --> 18:57.502
<i>He doesn't even have 10 minutes.</i>

18:57.504 --> 18:58.903
What's happening?
What's going on?!

18:58.905 --> 19:00.571
Scott'll be here in about 20.

19:00.573 --> 19:02.673
We'll get him stabilized
and prepped for surgery.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.231
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

19:04.232 --> 19:05.788
We're taking him
straight to the OR.

19:05.789 --> 19:07.345
I'll start, and then Scott
can jump in in the surgery.

19:07.347 --> 19:08.746
<i>Okay?</i>
Great.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.685
Should be just fine.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.320
Let's go.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.890
BP's dropping again.
We got to hang another unit.

19:18.892 --> 19:19.924
This is the last one, Scott.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.246
He should've
been on that chopper.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.897
It's the police!
Put your weapon down now!

19:25.899 --> 19:27.431
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.534
I didn't know you were the cops.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.736
Show me your hands!

19:31.738 --> 19:33.138
This is my store.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.539
I swear, I thought
you were looters.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.841
I've been calling the cops
to help me for hours.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.410
Had shooters in my alley.

19:39.412 --> 19:42.780
Hey, get a counter cleared off,
and get these lights on for us.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.218
All right,
let's get him up here.

19:47.220 --> 19:48.819
One, two, three.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.723
Good.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.192
Get a look at the shooter?

19:54.194 --> 19:55.526
Yeah... black kid,
blue hoodie.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.694
That's what I called in.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.930
Is this him?

19:58.932 --> 20:00.965
Sean?

20:00.967 --> 20:03.301
What, you know him?
Yeah.

20:03.303 --> 20:05.870
He delivers sandwiches from
the deli down on the corner.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.805
Is he gonna make it?

20:12.027 --> 20:13.276
Breathe through this.
Slow, deep breaths.

20:13.279 --> 20:15.046
Exam 1.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.814
Shannon, I got to get back inside
and help with the overflow,

20:16.816 --> 20:17.982
so you're gonna be on your own.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.717
Let me hear the drill
one more time.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.451
Patients with tear gas on them
go in and undress.

20:21.454 --> 20:23.254
Put their stuff
in a plastic bag,

20:23.256 --> 20:25.856
then wash and rinse with clean water
and get into clean clothes.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.909
You sure you got all this?

20:27.910 --> 20:29.961
I've got five younger siblings.
It's called bathtime.

20:29.963 --> 20:31.529
Okay.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.064
Docs.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.598
Got this little guy
needs your help here.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.534
Found him wandering
through some tear gas.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.402
Says his name is Charles.
He got lost.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.337
Take a seat there, Charles.

20:39.339 --> 20:39.971
I'm Dr. drew.

20:39.973 --> 20:41.739
This is Shannon.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.374
Hey, little man.
Can I listen to your lungs?

20:43.376 --> 20:44.675
I want my mom.

20:44.677 --> 20:46.294
Yeah, I know you do, buddy.

20:46.295 --> 20:47.912
And she wants you,
and she's looking for you, too.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.881
We're gonna find her, all right?

20:50.883 --> 20:52.550
Drew, T.C.'s landing.

20:52.552 --> 20:54.285
He wants you to make sure
the OR is prepped.

20:54.287 --> 20:55.720
Okay. Yeah.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.655
Go ahead.
I got this.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.257
I don't care what the tests say.

20:59.259 --> 21:00.558
I know there's something
wrong with me.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.060
My head is killing me.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.561
Do you have a history
of migraines?

21:03.563 --> 21:04.996
Only in the last few months,

21:04.998 --> 21:06.998
and, um,
trouble remembering things.

21:07.000 --> 21:10.268
All right. Are your headaches
usually this bad?

21:10.270 --> 21:11.769
Oh, no.
No, never this bad.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.504
This is...
This is really...

21:13.506 --> 21:15.673
I need Ativan.

21:16.743 --> 21:18.509
Grab Topher. I got this.
Okay, you got it.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.551
Hey. Scott's stuck on-scene
with the other GSW.

21:27.553 --> 21:28.897
What?

21:28.898 --> 21:30.242
The ambulance got trashed.

21:30.243 --> 21:31.587
Chopper's gonna refuel
and head back.

21:31.591 --> 21:33.324
How's the kid?
Not good.

21:33.326 --> 21:34.859
Scott's opening him up
in some pawnshop.

21:34.861 --> 21:36.472
Only one could go.

21:36.473 --> 21:38.084
I had to make a decision.
I made a call.

21:38.085 --> 21:39.696
Listen to me. It was gonna be
right or wrong either way.

21:39.699 --> 21:41.666
- Let's just hope they both turn out okay.
- We got bad news.

21:41.668 --> 21:43.934
Dr. Clegg won't be here
for another 30 minutes.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.303
Okay.

21:45.305 --> 21:46.404
Looks like
it's just the two of us.

21:46.406 --> 21:48.339
Hey, how you holding up here?

21:48.341 --> 21:49.740
Patients outnumber us 10 to 1,

21:49.742 --> 21:52.043
there's a missing child,
media jackals are everywhere...

21:52.045 --> 21:54.412
Dr. Zia,
Benedict is crashing.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.681
Got to go.
I'll check in later.

21:56.683 --> 21:58.349
I-I-i called
David's wife, Cindy.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.351
She's on her way in,
but she's devastated.

22:00.353 --> 22:01.919
Yeah, that's a tough call.

22:01.921 --> 22:03.888
Doc, no bull.
What are his chances?

22:03.890 --> 22:05.890
We got to get him
prepped for surgery,

22:05.891 --> 22:07.891
and after that, we'll know more,
but he's lost a lot of blood.

22:07.894 --> 22:09.894
Hey, drew, get anesthesia
to hang two units.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.862
I'll be right there
once I'm changed.

22:13.081 --> 22:14.297
Come on.

22:14.298 --> 22:15.514
The Ativan isn't working.
He's in status.

22:15.515 --> 22:16.731
What the hell?
His head ct came back normal.

22:16.736 --> 22:17.902
Checking another sugar.

22:17.903 --> 22:19.069
No, we did check another sugar,
and it came back normal.

22:19.072 --> 22:20.571
Should I page neuro?

22:20.573 --> 22:21.439
No. Not yet.

22:21.441 --> 22:22.940
Blood sugar undetectable.

22:22.942 --> 22:24.575
Wait, what?
Give me d50.

22:24.577 --> 22:27.445
Patient needs dextrose.
Come on, come on.

22:33.353 --> 22:35.453
Okay, I want a dextrose drip
at 100 ccs per hour

22:35.455 --> 22:36.671
and 20-minute
glucose checks.

22:36.672 --> 22:37.888
Why would his blood sugar
plummet like that?

22:37.890 --> 22:40.007
I have an idea.

22:40.008 --> 22:42.125
Let's get a ct of his abdomen
with iv and Po contrast.

22:42.128 --> 22:43.761
Nice save, Jordan.
Thanks.

22:46.399 --> 22:49.133
He seemed like an okay kid.

22:49.135 --> 22:50.368
But he had a gun.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.103
It's Texas.
Everybody has a gun.

22:52.105 --> 22:53.821
Open carry.

22:53.822 --> 22:55.538
He was robbed before,
so he wanted to protect himself.

22:55.541 --> 22:56.674
Why do you think
I have a shotgun?

22:56.676 --> 22:57.742
The chopper's close.

22:57.744 --> 22:58.776
It's looking
for a place to land,

22:58.778 --> 23:00.010
but the crowd's making it hard.

23:00.012 --> 23:01.579
How can you not
just get them out of here?

23:01.580 --> 23:03.147
If we don't get him back
to a hospital, he's gonna die.

23:03.149 --> 23:06.684
And how would you do that?
Shoot them? More tear gas?

23:06.686 --> 23:08.419
It's called a riot for a reason.

23:08.421 --> 23:09.387
He should've gone first.

23:09.389 --> 23:10.121
Hey, Paul. Focus.

23:10.123 --> 23:11.956
We got to stop this bleeding.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.924
The bullet caused some kind
of retrohepatic injury,

23:13.926 --> 23:15.159
but I can't tell what.

23:15.161 --> 23:16.827
C-can we fix it?

23:16.829 --> 23:18.062
With this equipment
out here, no,

23:18.064 --> 23:19.997
but we can minimize
the bleeding.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.032
Hand me a Kelly clamp. We're
gonna do a Pringle maneuver.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.768
By clamping the hepatic artery
and the portal vein...

23:23.770 --> 23:25.803
Slow the bleeding down enough
to get us to the hospital.

23:25.805 --> 23:26.604
Exactly.

23:26.606 --> 23:32.643
Place the clamp right... There.

23:32.645 --> 23:34.445
Retract for me and reset.

23:38.885 --> 23:39.683
Good.

23:39.685 --> 23:41.118
It's working, for now.

23:41.119 --> 23:42.599
Hey, what's the update
on the chopper?

23:47.627 --> 23:48.627
Damn it!

23:53.032 --> 23:54.465
Hey! Paul!

23:54.467 --> 23:55.099
Paul!

23:55.101 --> 23:56.700
Where are you going?!

23:56.702 --> 23:58.002
Hey, stop! Stop this!

23:58.004 --> 23:59.603
Hey, hey! Stop! Stop!

23:59.605 --> 24:01.005
Stop! Hey!

24:01.007 --> 24:02.990
What the hell do <i> you</i> want?

24:02.991 --> 24:04.974
I'm the doctor trying to save
the kid who was shot.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.844
The kid that was shot
by the cops?

24:06.846 --> 24:08.446
The cop in there?
Hey, hey, hey... no!

24:08.448 --> 24:09.914
We want to talk to him!
Stop it!

24:09.916 --> 24:11.081
Stop! Get back!

24:11.083 --> 24:12.750
No!

24:15.688 --> 24:17.171
Don't take another step!

24:17.172 --> 24:18.655
Everybody, put your hands
behind your back!

24:18.658 --> 24:20.158
Get down on your knees now!

24:20.159 --> 24:21.659
Oh, no, no, no!
Shoot me in the heart.

24:21.661 --> 24:23.060
Or wait... maybe you want me
to turn around

24:23.062 --> 24:24.562
so you can do it
in my back, huh?!

24:24.564 --> 24:25.963
- I said get down on your knees now!
- Oh, no!

24:25.965 --> 24:27.531
Just do it!
No, stop, stop, stop, stop!

24:27.533 --> 24:28.899
Do it!
Put the gun down!

24:28.901 --> 24:29.800
Put the gun down.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.736
Okay? He can help us.

24:32.738 --> 24:34.038
Hey.

24:37.176 --> 24:38.476
Hey.

24:38.478 --> 24:39.543
Hey!

24:40.947 --> 24:41.979
Yeah.

24:41.981 --> 24:44.014
He was shot by the cops.

24:44.016 --> 24:46.217
But right now,
the only thing that matters

24:46.219 --> 24:48.586
is getting him to a hospital,
or he will die.

24:48.588 --> 24:51.021
That'll be just as much
your fault as anyone else's

24:51.023 --> 24:52.756
if you don't
let our chopper land.

24:52.758 --> 24:54.275
He needs surgery.

24:54.276 --> 24:55.793
You got to help us
get out of here.

24:58.598 --> 24:59.897
Hey.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.765
You're the leader, right?

25:01.767 --> 25:03.267
So lead.

25:03.269 --> 25:05.536
Make them make room for us.

25:06.672 --> 25:09.573
You heard the doc.
Do it.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.148
Come on, man.

25:23.256 --> 25:25.789
Hey! Hey, over here!

25:25.791 --> 25:28.025
Listen up!
We got an injured brother there!

25:28.027 --> 25:29.627
That was pretty badass.

25:29.628 --> 25:31.228
We need to help them
get him to the hospital!

25:31.230 --> 25:34.031
Remind me that
when I stop shaking.

25:35.635 --> 25:37.034
Is the "roadside racist" dead?

25:37.036 --> 25:39.570
What about the officer?
Can you give us his condition?

25:39.572 --> 25:42.706
Is it true that an African-American
shooting victim was left at the scene

25:42.708 --> 25:44.642
so you could attend
to a white police officer?

25:44.644 --> 25:46.610
Hey, hey, that did not
happen like that!

25:46.612 --> 25:48.212
We treat everybody the same.

25:48.213 --> 25:49.813
So he has been brought
to the hospital?

25:49.815 --> 25:51.715
No, he's on his way.

25:51.716 --> 25:53.616
So he has been left
in lieu of the white officer?

25:53.619 --> 25:57.821
Hey, you're twisting everything.
It was a medical decision.

25:57.823 --> 26:00.324
It had nothing
to do with any race.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.726
The people in this ER
dedicate their lives...

26:02.728 --> 26:04.628
Man, Topher's getting eaten alive.
To treating anybody...

26:04.630 --> 26:05.829
Anybody who walks
through those doors.

26:05.831 --> 26:07.197
So the black kid isn't here?

26:07.199 --> 26:09.266
That crowd is getting
angrier and angrier.

26:09.268 --> 26:10.668
It was a medical decision.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.069
Time to change that narrative.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.388
Hey.
You're not listening!

26:14.389 --> 26:16.706
- Lies! Liar!
- No patient is denied care for any reason!

26:16.709 --> 26:18.897
For the last time, a
medical decision is

26:18.922 --> 26:21.245
based... Hey! Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey!

26:21.247 --> 26:23.047
Hey! Hello!
Shannon.

26:23.049 --> 26:25.683
Hi.
I'm Dr. Shannon Rivera.

26:25.685 --> 26:27.335
I'm an intern here,

26:27.336 --> 26:28.986
and I was hoping
you guys could help us.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.855
This is Charles.

26:30.856 --> 26:32.723
He's 10 years old,
and he was lost in the riots,

26:32.725 --> 26:35.225
and he would really like
to find his mommy.

26:35.227 --> 26:37.027
Can you help us?

26:37.029 --> 26:38.596
Hey, Charles!
Charles!

26:38.598 --> 26:40.197
What's your mommy's name?

26:40.199 --> 26:41.198
Tiffany.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.366
Where do you live?

26:42.368 --> 26:43.901
Okay. Thank you.

26:43.903 --> 26:46.704
What does your mom look like?

26:46.706 --> 26:48.672
Shannon, we have to go through
family services

26:48.674 --> 26:50.441
when there's a lost child.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.209
Yeah, when I called, they said
they couldn't come for hours,

26:52.211 --> 26:53.527
which is ridiculous,

26:53.528 --> 26:54.844
so I started a hashtag...
Findcharlesmommy.

26:54.847 --> 26:57.047
You what?
It's already trending.

26:57.049 --> 26:58.682
Don't worry.
I linked family services.

26:58.684 --> 27:00.751
We figured old-school media
couldn't hurt, right?

27:00.753 --> 27:02.119
- Yeah, right.
- Dr. Rivera!

27:02.121 --> 27:03.387
I've got a room all set up,

27:03.389 --> 27:05.289
and I found a lab tech
going off duty to babysit.

27:05.291 --> 27:07.157
- Thanks, Jocelyn.
- Yeah. Come on, Charles.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.326
I'll check on you later,
little man.

27:09.328 --> 27:11.629
Don't forget your ice cream,
sweetie.

27:11.631 --> 27:14.064
So, I'll grab another patient?

27:14.066 --> 27:16.800
You... y-yes.
You do that.

27:18.638 --> 27:20.404
Bullet number two.

27:20.406 --> 27:22.906
That's number three.

27:22.908 --> 27:24.308
Nurse, call SAPD.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.110
- Tell them they come pick up the bullets.
- Yes, doctor.

27:26.111 --> 27:27.911
Hey, guys, no sign of the
fireworks slowing down outside.

27:27.913 --> 27:29.163
What's the update here?

27:29.164 --> 27:30.414
Bullets are out,
but his inner lobe is shredded,

27:30.416 --> 27:32.082
and he tore his hilum...
It's a mess.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.417
What's the eta on Scott?

27:33.418 --> 27:34.751
Well, the chopper's
just picking him up now.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.053
He'll be here in 15.

27:36.055 --> 27:38.022
He's fibrillating.

27:38.024 --> 27:40.190
Okay, let's hang two units.
He needs more volume.

27:40.192 --> 27:42.292
Starting intracardiac massage.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.328
Let's get
the crash cart... now!

27:44.330 --> 27:46.397
You see that spot right there
on your pancreas?

27:46.399 --> 27:48.198
It's a small mass
called an insulinoma.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.250
Like a tumor?

27:50.251 --> 27:52.301
Yes. It excretes excess Insulin,
which lowers your blood sugar.

27:52.304 --> 27:55.039
I'm assuming that you haven't eaten
that much in the past few days,

27:55.041 --> 27:56.674
which lowered it
to dangerous levels.

27:56.676 --> 27:59.343
And that would explain
your fainting, headaches,

27:59.345 --> 28:00.744
the seizure.

28:00.746 --> 28:02.763
So, do I have cancer?

28:02.764 --> 28:04.781
Tumors like these
are rarely malignant.

28:04.784 --> 28:06.417
However, you will need
to have it removed,

28:06.419 --> 28:08.752
so we'll schedule a surgery
for next week.

28:08.754 --> 28:09.853
After that, you should be fine.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.789
Well, that's too bad.

28:11.791 --> 28:15.426
Most people take
not having cancer as good news.

28:15.428 --> 28:16.894
Yeah, well,
most people aren't about to

28:16.895 --> 28:18.415
spend the rest of their life
in prison.

28:19.465 --> 28:20.764
I know, I know.

28:20.766 --> 28:23.033
You probably think I deserve it.

28:23.035 --> 28:24.802
I wasn't gonna say that.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.140
You know, you're the first person I met

28:30.142 --> 28:31.592
since this whole thing happened

28:31.593 --> 28:33.043
that hasn't asked me
if I was guilty

28:33.045 --> 28:35.446
or told me that I was.

28:35.448 --> 28:37.598
That's not my business.

28:37.599 --> 28:39.919
And I'm guessing, if you could,
you would take it all back.

28:40.486 --> 28:42.720
The shooting? No.

28:42.722 --> 28:44.788
Because then I know I'd be dead.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.758
I did nothing wrong.

28:47.760 --> 28:50.461
I was under attack,
and I defended myself.

28:50.463 --> 28:52.964
I didn't shoot Bruno Mars.

28:52.965 --> 28:55.466
I shot a massive, angry man
who was going to kill me.

28:55.468 --> 28:57.901
He just <i>happened</i> to be black.

28:59.939 --> 29:01.839
So, yeah.

29:01.841 --> 29:05.342
And if I had to do it again,
I would.

29:05.344 --> 29:08.078
I can't imagine that sentiment
would go over well with a jury.

29:08.080 --> 29:10.481
Well, that's why my lawyers
wouldn't let me testify.

29:10.483 --> 29:13.117
See, I-I'm not afraid
of the truth.

29:13.119 --> 29:16.453
That's why I didn't mind
talking to that nurse.

29:16.455 --> 29:20.457
I'm just...
A regular guy...

29:20.459 --> 29:28.165
Who had a regular life, a job...
A family.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.400
I mean, I-I've never been
in trouble before.

29:30.402 --> 29:32.369
I've never even
had a speeding ticket.

29:32.371 --> 29:37.040
Now I'm about to lose everything
because I defended my life.

29:40.780 --> 29:41.979
I'm sorry.

29:43.849 --> 29:46.016
I'll let the sheriff know
that you're about to leave.

29:47.386 --> 29:48.418
Hey, doc.

29:48.420 --> 29:49.520
Yeah?

29:49.522 --> 29:51.488
Thanks for the kindness.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.557
I don't get too much of it
these days.

30:11.844 --> 30:13.344
Thank you.

30:13.345 --> 30:14.845
You save his ass, young'un!
You hear me?

30:14.847 --> 30:15.445
We'll do our best.

30:15.447 --> 30:17.131
Is he gonna make it?

30:17.132 --> 30:18.816
I don't know.
He's lost a lot of... he's gonna make it!

30:18.818 --> 30:21.018
There's no way we're letting him
die! Let's go!

30:50.115 --> 30:51.481
This is Sean Henderson.

30:51.483 --> 30:53.217
Status...
Post-GSW to abdomen

30:53.218 --> 30:54.952
with his hepatoduodenal ligament
clamped in the field.

30:54.954 --> 30:56.810
BP's back down to 50 systolic.

30:56.811 --> 30:58.667
Let's get him straight up to
the OR. Tell them we're coming.

30:58.668 --> 31:00.524
The cops are still in OR 1.
The rest are filled with trauma victims.

31:00.526 --> 31:01.592
Then we're doing surgery here.
What's open?

31:01.594 --> 31:03.277
Trauma 2, trauma 2.

31:03.278 --> 31:04.961
Open a laparotomy tray,
set up for intubation,

31:04.964 --> 31:06.864
and find all the O neg you can.

31:06.866 --> 31:08.632
Yes, doctor.

31:08.633 --> 31:10.399
Set up the rapid infuser.
Get me a sterile gown.

31:10.402 --> 31:11.935
How is he?

31:11.937 --> 31:13.337
Not good.

31:13.339 --> 31:14.972
Really bad, actually.

31:14.974 --> 31:17.174
Sh-should've been in the OR
20 minutes ago.

31:17.176 --> 31:20.143
Yeah, well, maybe he shouldn't
have drawn on my partner.

31:20.145 --> 31:21.645
What if he didn't?!

31:21.647 --> 31:23.413
What if you shot the wrong
black kid in the hoodie?

31:23.415 --> 31:24.214
He had a gun!

31:24.216 --> 31:25.349
Which is his right.

31:25.351 --> 31:27.284
Open carry is not just
for white people.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.986
Hey, don't put this on me.

31:28.988 --> 31:31.321
I've been doing this
for 15 years.

31:31.323 --> 31:33.924
It was a riot.
If somebody has a gun...

31:33.926 --> 31:36.193
You have no idea
what it's like out there.

31:38.063 --> 31:39.897
I was doing my job.

31:39.899 --> 31:41.331
Yeah, so was Sean.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.467
He was returning
from delivering a deli order.

31:49.942 --> 31:51.942
So, the good news is,
they found Charles' mom.

31:51.944 --> 31:53.944
The bad news is,
she's at St. Luke's

31:53.946 --> 31:55.212
with injuries from the riot.

31:55.214 --> 31:57.281
- Who takes their kid out in a riot?
- She didn't.

31:57.283 --> 31:59.049
She was caught in it
coming home from work,

31:59.051 --> 32:00.017
and they got separated.

32:00.019 --> 32:01.351
She's frantic to get him back,

32:01.353 --> 32:02.653
but there's no way
to get him there

32:02.655 --> 32:04.087
until after this clears up.

32:04.089 --> 32:05.322
Which could be who knows when.

32:05.324 --> 32:07.157
How's he doing?

32:07.158 --> 32:08.991
Eh, he's 10, he's scared,
and he misses his mommy,

32:08.994 --> 32:10.661
but I set up a facetime
so he got to see her.

32:10.663 --> 32:12.329
Good job.

32:12.330 --> 32:13.996
All right, so, keep working
the decontamination tent,

32:13.999 --> 32:16.400
and we'll just keep him
as comfortable as we can.

32:16.402 --> 32:19.369
Topher, four more injured coming in,
and we're almost out of O neg.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.271
Damn it. Get on the horn
and find us more.

32:21.273 --> 32:22.639
Try St. Luke's.

32:24.376 --> 32:25.709
How many rounds of epi?

32:25.711 --> 32:28.045
That was the fifth,
and six units of blood.

32:28.047 --> 32:30.180
Any cardiac activity?
No. Nothing.

32:30.182 --> 32:31.548
Okay, shock again.

32:32.651 --> 32:35.185
Clear.

32:37.056 --> 32:39.089
Still nothing?

32:42.094 --> 32:43.727
Asystole.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.697
Tee.
Yeah.

32:51.170 --> 32:52.970
Yeah.

32:52.972 --> 32:55.472
Time of death...
10:17 P.M.

32:55.474 --> 32:56.740
Hey, we did what we could.

32:56.742 --> 32:58.275
He was pretty much gone, though,

32:58.277 --> 33:00.043
the moment
those bullets hit his chest.

33:00.045 --> 33:01.245
Those .40s...
They're bad news.

33:11.406 --> 33:13.056
You're bypassing
the laceration? We have to.

33:13.058 --> 33:15.192
The blood's pouring out
of the vein too quickly.

33:15.194 --> 33:17.094
Kelly clamp and a chest tube.

33:17.096 --> 33:19.029
How's a chest tube help
his bleeding vein?

33:19.031 --> 33:20.764
Chest tube should shunt
the blood back up to the heart

33:20.766 --> 33:21.765
if it works.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.066
Scalpel.

33:23.068 --> 33:25.168
How's it going?
Hail Mary time.

33:25.170 --> 33:27.004
We'll know
in about five minutes,

33:27.006 --> 33:28.438
after I suture this into place.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.674
But if this doesn't restore
volume to the heart,

33:30.676 --> 33:31.608
I'm out of options.

33:31.610 --> 33:32.943
Which is total BS.

33:32.944 --> 33:34.277
We shouldn't even
be in this position.

33:34.279 --> 33:35.605
If... if T.C. hadn't
taken that cop first...

33:35.629 --> 33:36.046
Paul.

33:36.048 --> 33:37.547
- Who shouldn't have shot...
- Paul!

33:38.584 --> 33:41.018
That cop just died on the table.

33:41.020 --> 33:43.286
Whatever happened out there,
that's a man in uniform

33:43.288 --> 33:46.123
who lost his life doing a job
that nobody wants to do.

33:47.059 --> 33:49.126
So show some respect, okay?

34:00.272 --> 34:02.539
Hey.
How you doing?

34:02.541 --> 34:03.407
Fine.

34:03.409 --> 34:04.341
No.

34:04.343 --> 34:07.277
Uh, not great.

34:07.279 --> 34:10.080
I can break it to his partner.
It's no problem.

34:10.081 --> 34:11.415
No, it's all right.

34:11.417 --> 34:12.882
I'll do it.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.350
Just, uh,
just gonna be a tough one.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.520
Yeah, losing your partner,
shooting a kid...

34:16.522 --> 34:17.754
That's a hell of a night.

34:17.755 --> 34:19.489
It's gonna get
a whole lot worse.

34:19.491 --> 34:21.058
What do you mean?

34:22.094 --> 34:24.127
When I was out there,
I saw the kid's gun.

34:24.129 --> 34:26.129
It was a .38.

34:26.130 --> 34:29.166
The bullets we pulled from
the cop were from a .40 Cal.

34:29.168 --> 34:32.268
So Sean, that kid... he didn't
kill Rebecca's partner.

34:32.271 --> 34:34.304
Rebecca did.

34:37.609 --> 34:38.641
Hey.

34:38.643 --> 34:40.661
Thanks.

34:40.661 --> 34:42.679
So, the sheriff says the jury
reached a verdict on Benedict.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.398
They're gonna read it tomorrow.

34:44.399 --> 34:46.116
He gets off, tomorrow's gonna
be another long night.

34:46.118 --> 34:47.451
It's already been a long night,

34:47.453 --> 34:48.819
and we're only
an hour into the shift.

34:48.821 --> 34:50.187
Yeah.

34:50.188 --> 34:54.257
Look, Kenny... About
earlier, our fight...

34:54.259 --> 34:55.492
I'm sorry.

34:55.494 --> 34:57.511
Don't be.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.529
That wasn't a fight.
It was a spirited discussion.

35:08.173 --> 35:09.656
Hey. Don't worry.

35:09.657 --> 35:11.140
I know your heart's
in the right place...

35:11.143 --> 35:12.175
Even if your head isn't.

35:24.490 --> 35:26.389
Don't move.
Don't move!

35:27.192 --> 35:28.625
Come on, come on.

35:31.130 --> 35:32.329
Somebody shot him!

35:32.331 --> 35:33.497
Get him over.

35:37.603 --> 35:39.269
Oh, my god.

35:45.827 --> 35:46.810
Come on, Steven.
Stay with us.

35:46.812 --> 35:47.978
Pulse is weak.

35:47.979 --> 35:49.145
Somebody page neurosurg...
Now!

35:49.148 --> 35:50.614
Bring the crash cart in here.

35:50.616 --> 35:53.216
I need an intubation tray
and 100 of mannitol.

35:53.218 --> 35:53.917
I lost his pulse.

35:53.919 --> 35:55.652
Come on. Come on.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.287
Come on.

35:58.223 --> 35:59.940
What the hell happened?

35:59.941 --> 36:01.658
Some nut just shot Jordan's patient...
That Benedict guy.

36:01.660 --> 36:02.893
Here?!
Yeah.

36:02.895 --> 36:04.395
Anybody else hurt?

36:04.396 --> 36:05.896
Uh, no. They tackled
the guy that did it.

36:05.898 --> 36:08.865
- Drew!
- Yeah, okay. Uh, get her to ct.

36:08.867 --> 36:10.283
How's your guy?

36:10.284 --> 36:11.700
Uh, we got lucky. Looks like
he's gonna pull through.

36:11.703 --> 36:12.819
That wasn't luck.

36:12.820 --> 36:13.936
He used a chest tube
to bypass the IVC

36:13.939 --> 36:15.438
and shunt blood
back to the heart.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.574
What? That's hardcore.
It was a good team effort.

36:17.576 --> 36:18.875
Anyway, he's not
out of the woods yet.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.794
All right, nurse, take him up.

36:20.795 --> 36:22.712
Get 4 units of blood in him
before I do any more surgery.

36:22.714 --> 36:24.347
Hey. Drew.

36:24.349 --> 36:26.349
The cop
that T.C. Brought in...

36:26.351 --> 36:28.485
Is there anything I could have
done? Maybe saved him?

36:28.487 --> 36:30.220
No way.
His chest was a total mess.

36:30.222 --> 36:31.321
Miracle he even made it here.

36:31.323 --> 36:33.290
So T.C. Made
the right call, then.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.425
Sean's gonna get
charged with murder.

36:35.427 --> 36:37.260
I don't think so.

36:42.935 --> 36:45.396
I don't... I don't

36:45.421 --> 36:47.404
know how I'm gonna tell Cindy.

36:47.406 --> 36:51.441
They're expecting a baby.

36:51.443 --> 36:53.276
If only I'd gotten
to that alley sooner.

36:53.278 --> 36:54.945
I could have taken that kid out
before he...

36:54.947 --> 36:55.946
Rebecca.

36:55.948 --> 36:57.280
And you just watch!

36:57.282 --> 36:59.482
He's gonna be fine!
He'll live.

36:59.484 --> 37:01.318
Okay, Rebecca. Hey.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.486
There's something you need
to know about the shooter.

37:03.488 --> 37:04.721
What do you mean?

37:04.723 --> 37:07.290
Sometimes, in the fog of war,

37:07.292 --> 37:08.758
things don't always happen
the way that we...

37:08.760 --> 37:10.460
We want them to
or that we think.

37:10.462 --> 37:12.262
What are you saying?

37:12.264 --> 37:15.665
I'm just saying that...
That I've been there.

37:15.667 --> 37:17.484
Okay?

37:17.485 --> 37:19.302
The bullets we took
from David's body...

37:19.304 --> 37:20.503
They were .40 Cal.

37:20.505 --> 37:22.005
Okay?
No.

37:22.007 --> 37:23.907
They were yours.

37:24.977 --> 37:26.509
I'm sorry.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.891
Get the blood and the rapid infuser.

37:44.329 --> 37:45.562
Hold CPR.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.265
Still nothing.
Resuming CPR.

37:48.267 --> 37:50.533
Give bicarb followed
by another amp of epi.

37:50.535 --> 37:52.869
Come on! Come on!

37:55.040 --> 37:56.306
Come on, buddy!

37:56.308 --> 37:57.807
Kenny...

37:57.809 --> 37:59.276
Kenny. Kenny, stop.
Come on! Come on!

37:59.278 --> 38:00.543
Stop. Stop!

38:00.545 --> 38:02.445
Come on.

38:02.447 --> 38:04.381
There's brain matter.

38:04.383 --> 38:06.316
We're done.

38:06.318 --> 38:09.419
Time of death... 10:26.

38:21.066 --> 38:23.633
Make sure St. Luke's gives us
all the O neg we asked for.

38:23.635 --> 38:24.968
It's part of the trade.

38:24.970 --> 38:27.304
Don't worry. I won't
let those bastards cheat us.

38:27.306 --> 38:29.506
Wha... hey!
Children.

38:29.508 --> 38:31.541
Be back in 30 minutes.
It's gonna be a long night.

38:31.543 --> 38:34.678
Got it. Get the blood,
take Charles to his mom.

38:34.680 --> 38:37.414
- I'm going to go see my mom?!
- Mm-hmm.

38:37.416 --> 38:39.616
- How?
- You ever ride on a helicopter?

38:39.618 --> 38:41.785
No.
Well...

38:43.455 --> 38:45.272
No way!
Yes way.

38:45.273 --> 38:47.090
Now, I want you to take care
of Dr. Rivera, okay?

38:47.092 --> 38:49.426
I'm putting you in charge.

38:50.429 --> 38:51.695
Thanks, captain.

38:51.697 --> 38:53.096
Let's get out of here,
little man.

39:04.643 --> 39:05.842
Word on the street is

39:05.844 --> 39:08.478
that you were superman
out there tonight.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.380
Yeah, I don't know about that.

39:10.382 --> 39:11.815
I was scared to death.

39:11.817 --> 39:13.416
Aw, man,
anybody would have been.

39:13.418 --> 39:14.617
Man, I probably
would have cried.

39:14.619 --> 39:15.919
I doubt that.

39:18.123 --> 39:20.824
You know what else I was
out there?

39:20.826 --> 39:23.860
Pissed... at T.C.

39:28.100 --> 39:30.867
The guy's been my hero,
but... I have to admit,

39:30.869 --> 39:33.136
the thought did cross my mind...

39:33.138 --> 39:34.971
Did he take the cop first
'cause he was white?

39:34.973 --> 39:37.507
Aw, come on, man.
You know that's not true.

39:37.509 --> 39:38.875
Yeah. I know.

39:39.878 --> 39:42.045
But did he take him in

39:42.047 --> 39:43.613
because he's another man
in uniform?

39:43.615 --> 39:45.515
Maybe.

39:45.517 --> 39:47.917
I guess we all have
our own unintended biases.

39:47.919 --> 39:50.553
I know I've got mine.

39:50.555 --> 39:51.788
Which are...?

39:52.991 --> 39:55.158
Spoiled rich kids like you.

39:55.160 --> 39:57.794
Why do you think
I give you so much crap?

39:57.796 --> 39:59.429
'Cause I'm an easy target?

39:59.431 --> 40:00.997
Well, there's that.

40:00.999 --> 40:03.733
Definitely that.

40:03.735 --> 40:06.136
But honestly, uh...

40:06.138 --> 40:07.788
Maybe I'm a little jealous.

40:07.789 --> 40:09.439
I never had what you had, man,
and I never will.

40:09.441 --> 40:10.607
Yeah, man, but you could.

40:10.609 --> 40:11.708
No, I can't.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.877
You have a gift.
You have a family.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.712
I've got me.

40:15.714 --> 40:17.781
And that's okay.

40:17.782 --> 40:19.849
But no matter how successful
or great a surgeon you become,

40:19.851 --> 40:21.117
I just never want you
to lose touch

40:21.119 --> 40:23.186
with those
that are less fortunate.

40:23.188 --> 40:25.054
You know?

40:25.056 --> 40:26.623
Yeah.

40:26.625 --> 40:30.527
Look, I...
I overreacted earlier.

40:30.529 --> 40:31.928
Sometimes, the slights
just build up,

40:31.930 --> 40:34.097
but I never should have
taken that out on you, man.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.932
I'm... I'm sorry.

40:37.202 --> 40:39.969
I-I shouldn't have been
so naive, you know?

40:41.606 --> 40:42.939
Hmm?

40:42.941 --> 40:44.207
Yeah.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.562
Aw, man.

40:48.563 --> 40:50.447
Sounds like we both have
something to work on.

40:50.449 --> 40:52.215
Yep.

40:52.217 --> 40:54.017
Might want to
wash the blood off of that

40:54.019 --> 40:56.436
before you put that back on.

40:56.437 --> 40:58.854
I'm not putting it back on.
I'm sending it back to my dad.

40:58.857 --> 41:01.024
Really?
Pretty nice piece of bling.

41:01.026 --> 41:03.726
Yeah, I've realized
it's just not me.

41:03.728 --> 41:05.662
So... Rebecca's not
gonna be charged,

41:05.664 --> 41:07.730
but I don't know
if she's gonna recover

41:07.732 --> 41:09.783
from killing her partner.

41:09.784 --> 41:11.835
Well, I've seen people recover
from worse things. Yeah.

41:11.837 --> 41:12.836
You headed back out there?

41:12.838 --> 41:14.221
It's only been
a few hours, Toph.

41:14.222 --> 41:15.605
We still got a long night
ahead of us.

41:15.607 --> 41:16.840
Hey, sorry about your patient.

41:16.841 --> 41:18.074
Yeah, yours, too.
Hey, be careful out there.

41:18.076 --> 41:19.776
Yeah, you be careful in here.

41:19.778 --> 41:22.479
Okay, people, we've got four
traumas coming from the riots.

41:22.481 --> 41:24.047
The first is rolling in
right now...

41:24.049 --> 41:26.683
32-year-old male...
I need a suture tray.

41:26.685 --> 41:28.852
- Two more right behind it.
- Call radiology. Let's get a c-spine film.

41:28.854 --> 41:30.887
Let's get her to curtain 3.

41:30.888 --> 41:32.921
Let's stay focused, and we'll
get through this together.

41:32.924 --> 41:34.958
Take him straight to ct.
We need vascular.

41:34.960 --> 41:36.526
I got this one.
Curtain 4.
