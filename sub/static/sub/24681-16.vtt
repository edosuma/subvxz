<i>In New York City's
war on crime,</i>

00:09.289 --> 00:11.314
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:11.391 --> 00:14.224

of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:14.294 --> 00:16.056
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:19.066 --> 00:23.901
Oh, sweetie, careful. Mama
has to finish her work tonight.

00:24.371 --> 00:27.067
Damn it! It's already
gone to collection.

00:27.140 --> 00:30.473
Honey, can you take him? I
have to get these pieces ready.

00:30.544 --> 00:32.273
Come here.
Come here.

00:34.681 --> 00:35.841
You bought new boots?

00:35.916 --> 00:38.180
He grew out of
the other ones.

00:38.385 --> 00:42.583
You know, whatever you think
I'm made of, Vanessa, I'm not.

01:04.044 --> 01:07.207
That's a three-and-a-quarter
carat diamond bezel.

01:07.280 --> 01:10.909
The face is white
gold, not no stainless.

01:10.984 --> 01:14.613
That's gold, my friend.

01:45.652 --> 01:46.641
Who are you?

01:46.720 --> 01:49.348
I'm Vanessa.
I'm a little early.

01:49.423 --> 01:50.412
Early for what?

01:50.490 --> 01:51.514
Our appointment.

01:51.591 --> 01:54.719
Owen said you were
interested in my work.

01:54.795 --> 01:56.854
Well, today's your lucky day.

01:58.465 --> 02:00.990
Go! Go! Go!

02:03.570 --> 02:06.664
Coming through!
Watch your back.

02:22.222 --> 02:23.211
The head shot?

02:23.290 --> 02:26.191
Her name's Vanessa Nikos. I'm
trying to get a hold of her husband.

02:26.259 --> 02:29.660
Tell him to hurry up and come
have a last look, say goodbye.

02:31.097 --> 02:34.225
One gun,
one kid without a mother.

03:24.084 --> 03:27.611
He made me lie
face down in the back.

03:27.921 --> 03:29.855
I couldn't see anything.

03:30.724 --> 03:33.750
Then I heard him yelling
at the girl to get down.

03:34.861 --> 03:39.662
I heard breaking glass,
then I heard the shot.

03:40.133 --> 03:42.124
Was the woman
resisting him?

03:42.202 --> 03:44.693
Maybe.
It happened so fast.

03:44.771 --> 03:46.170
What did the security tape
show?

03:46.239 --> 03:47.866
Mr. Gehry hadn't
turned it on yet.

03:47.941 --> 03:50.774
But I've seen
this guy before.

03:51.645 --> 03:55.172
Two weeks ago, he came in,
middle of the afternoon.

03:55.248 --> 03:59.048
He said the management company sent
him to check the fire sprinklers.

03:59.119 --> 04:01.019
He show ID?
No.

04:01.087 --> 04:03.112
And the woman?
Ever see her before?

04:03.189 --> 04:04.417
No.

04:04.491 --> 04:08.450
She said she made an appointment
with my assistant Owen to

04:08.528 --> 04:09.893
show her work.

04:10.330 --> 04:12.696
But she wasn't
on my schedule.

04:12.766 --> 04:15.564
Where was Owen
during the robbery?

04:15.635 --> 04:16.966
Parking the car.

04:17.036 --> 04:18.060
I don't think
he's involved.

04:18.137 --> 04:20.504
That's because Owen would have
wanted any accomplice of his

04:20.574 --> 04:25.477
to take these Tiffany-style
bubble necklaces instead of

04:25.545 --> 04:27.536
these second-rate pinkie rings.

04:27.614 --> 04:28.979
Exactly.

04:30.417 --> 04:32.214
What's Owen's take
on this appointment?

04:32.285 --> 04:34.515
He says he never
talked to the girl.

04:34.588 --> 04:37.955
Never saw her till we found her
lying here with a bullet in her head.

04:38.024 --> 04:40.788
I'm guessing the young
lady was the decoy.

04:40.860 --> 04:43.124
Her accomplice decided he
preferred a one-way split.

04:43.196 --> 04:47.496
A decoy who brought
her press clippings?

04:49.102 --> 04:51.696
So, there's write-ups
on her jewelry designs,

04:51.771 --> 04:53.398
samples of her work.

04:54.007 --> 04:55.770
She came here
looking for a job.

04:55.842 --> 05:00.506
She had no appointment, yet somehow she
showed up just in time for the party.

05:03.216 --> 05:06.151
He called yesterday.

05:06.219 --> 05:08.517
He said his name was Owen from Gehry's.

05:08.588 --> 05:11.056
They'd seen her
stuff in magazines,

05:11.124 --> 05:14.491
and they wanted her to make a
presentation at 10:00 this morning.

05:14.561 --> 05:18.395
I told him 10:00 wasn't a good
time for her, but he insisted.

05:19.132 --> 05:24.399
So, you said that 10:00
wasn't convenient for Vanessa?

05:24.471 --> 05:26.735
My shift starts at 9:00,

05:26.806 --> 05:31.004
and she has Jake until 12:00, when
she drops him off at nursery school.

05:31.077 --> 05:33.841
Did she call Gehry's to change the time?

05:34.080 --> 05:36.344
She tried the number I got from Owen,

05:36.416 --> 05:38.441
but maybe I wrote it down wrong.

05:38.685 --> 05:40.778
And no one answered
at the regular number.

05:40.854 --> 05:43.220
But somehow she made it
to the store by 10:00.

05:43.289 --> 05:47.988
We got her mom to come over at 9:30.
I hung out with Jake until then.

05:48.061 --> 05:53.363
So, Vanessa never talked to Owen?

05:54.701 --> 05:55.963
Just you?

05:56.036 --> 05:58.630
Yeah, yes.
Come on, Jake, stop.

05:58.938 --> 06:00.735
Hey, Jake, here.

06:00.807 --> 06:03.037
Maybe you could play castle with these.

06:05.011 --> 06:08.412
You know, we saw your
wife's jewelry pieces.

06:08.481 --> 06:10.540
She was very talented.

06:10.617 --> 06:13.415
The materials looked
very expensive.

06:13.486 --> 06:16.319
Did you have to take
extra shifts to pay for it?

06:16.389 --> 06:19.051
Pulling doubles, working
six days a week sometimes.

06:19.125 --> 06:23.562
One of the write-ups in her sample case
said she used to be a social worker.

06:23.630 --> 06:26.963
Now, wouldn't it have been easier
for her to just go back to that?

06:27.033 --> 06:30.969
Excuse me, they got me signing
all these forms for organ donation.

06:31.037 --> 06:33.471
Jake, let's go.
I want. I want...

06:37.711 --> 06:42.011
He took the message. He jumped through
hoops to get her to the store by 10:00.

06:42.082 --> 06:46.644
He set her up. A hit
masquerading as a robbery?

06:48.088 --> 06:51.353
And now he has to raise
his son by himself.

06:51.825 --> 06:53.656
He can hardly handle
him for five minutes.

06:53.727 --> 06:55.456
Well, like any
self-respecting lout,

06:55.528 --> 06:58.326
he'll dump him on
his mother-in-law.

06:58.565 --> 07:01.625
The earliest I could get there was 9:30.

07:04.170 --> 07:09.540
I don't understand why he did this to
her, after all he's put her through.

07:10.009 --> 07:11.271
Martin?

07:12.846 --> 07:16.304
No. Him.

07:17.984 --> 07:21.044
All the things
God put her through?

07:21.621 --> 07:26.490
Five years ago, Vanessa took some
tetracycline I had in the closet.

07:27.093 --> 07:31.757
She didn't check the date.
It damaged her kidneys.

07:32.665 --> 07:35.293
She had to go on dialysis.

07:36.236 --> 07:41.299
She's pregnant with Jake. Women
on dialysis, they can't conceive.

07:41.374 --> 07:43.399
Did she have a transplant?

07:43.476 --> 07:50.109
Three years ago. A life-saving gift
from a living donor, a stranger.

07:52.786 --> 07:55.619
Now strangers will
receive her organs.

07:58.158 --> 08:01.355
If I hadn't
gone over at 9:30,

08:02.128 --> 08:04.756
there wouldn't have been
anyone to watch Jake.

08:04.831 --> 08:07.766
She wouldn't have
been in that store.

08:08.268 --> 08:11.032
It was out of your hands.

08:11.838 --> 08:16.798
Her heart was still beating
when they brought her in.

08:25.285 --> 08:28.652
They're all starting to look alike.

08:28.721 --> 08:32.282
Mr. Gehry, what time do you go to lunch?

08:32.558 --> 08:36.359
1:00 to 2:00. Owen
drives me to Toe Blake's.

08:37.297 --> 08:38.991
Okay, Mr. Gehry.
Why don't you take five?

08:43.736 --> 08:45.203
He pick a winner?
Not yet.

08:45.271 --> 08:48.365
But our sketch is
looking pretty good.

08:48.441 --> 08:49.635
It's all in the timing.

08:50.910 --> 08:55.938
10:00. That's the most inconvenient
time to get Vanessa to the store.

08:56.015 --> 08:57.414
Someone had to...

08:57.483 --> 09:00.509
Well, they had to find somebody
to watch Jake, the little boy.

09:01.888 --> 09:07.451
But 2:00. Jake is in nursery
school from 12:00 to 3:00.

09:08.561 --> 09:10.085
The jeweler was alone.

09:10.163 --> 09:12.461
2:00 would've been the most
convenient time to get the girl there.

09:12.532 --> 09:15.660
Yeah, someone else's
schedule was being served.

09:15.735 --> 09:19.000
Her heart was still
beating. She was left alive.

09:19.072 --> 09:21.006
With a bullet
still in her head.

09:21.074 --> 09:22.473
What kind of bullet?

09:22.542 --> 09:24.407
Ballistics just came in.

09:27.814 --> 09:29.281
.357.

09:29.349 --> 09:32.716
Should've gone right through her
skull, not to mention the wall.

09:32.785 --> 09:34.184
How far away was he when he shot her?

09:34.254 --> 09:35.482
It was a contact wound.

09:35.555 --> 09:38.581
He had the weapon pressed
against her temple.

09:38.658 --> 09:40.683
The front half of her head
should be blown clean off.

09:40.760 --> 09:43.194
He must've used a bullet
with a lightened load.

09:43.263 --> 09:46.061
Just enough to destroy
her frontal lobes.

09:49.636 --> 09:53.367
He wanted her brain-dead
with her heart still beating.

09:58.878 --> 10:00.436
A live donor.

10:03.583 --> 10:04.982
Organs from
a live donor,

10:05.051 --> 10:08.350
they stand a better
chance of being accepted.

10:12.191 --> 10:14.716
This looks good.
There won't be any problem.

10:14.794 --> 10:17.558
We are talking two
weeks from now, right?

10:17.630 --> 10:20.121
It's all set.
Everybody's lined up.

10:20.700 --> 10:24.158
I know this is going
to change your life,

10:24.237 --> 10:28.333
but until then, you have to
just stick to your routine.

10:35.214 --> 10:39.378
There's never been anybody
looking out for me but me.

10:48.127 --> 10:50.186
Her liver went to
Mount Sinai in Baltimore,

10:50.263 --> 10:51.924
her right lung to
Hartford Methodist,

10:51.998 --> 10:55.490
her left to Saint Beatrice in
Albany, her heart to Newark General,

10:55.568 --> 10:58.036
her pancreas to
Metropolitan in Philadelphia,

10:58.104 --> 10:59.128
her intestines to...

10:59.205 --> 11:03.733
Excuse me, did any of her
organs end up in this hospital?

11:04.043 --> 11:06.375
Yes. Mrs. Nikos had one kidney.

11:06.446 --> 11:07.879
It went to Sarah Edgars.

11:07.947 --> 11:10.438
Was she next up on the
waiting list for a transplant?

11:10.516 --> 11:12.711
That's not the only
determining factor.

11:12.785 --> 11:16.084
Mrs. Edgars and the deceased
shared a rare blood type.

11:16.155 --> 11:19.215
She was the only one on the
waiting list with that blood type?

11:19.292 --> 11:22.659
No, but she's here three
times a week for dialysis.

11:22.729 --> 11:25.789
And one of those times just happened
to be that morning at around 10:00?

11:25.865 --> 11:28.265
Yes. She's here
from 9:00 to 1:00.

11:29.035 --> 11:32.061
Timing,
it really is everything.

11:34.774 --> 11:37.106
Sarah Edgars has
glomerulonephritis.

11:37.176 --> 11:39.736
She'd been waiting for
a kidney for four years.

11:39.812 --> 11:41.279
Mickey Mantle waited
a day.

11:41.347 --> 11:44.874
If Vanessa Nikos' kidney
hadn't fallen into Sarah's lap,

11:44.951 --> 11:46.782
how long would she have
had to wait for one?

11:46.853 --> 11:48.286
It's impossible to say.

11:48.354 --> 11:51.050
Her family must
be growing desperate.

11:51.124 --> 11:52.751
There's only her son, Brian.

11:52.825 --> 11:55.487
He's been bringing her in for
her dialysis since he was 16.

11:55.561 --> 11:58.359
He waits for her four hours
a pop, three times a week?

11:58.431 --> 11:59.659
He's very devoted.

11:59.732 --> 12:03.133
He manages to pass the time
by chatting up the nurses.

12:03.202 --> 12:06.535
We're going to need
to meet Mrs. Edgars.

12:06.606 --> 12:09.837
Let me see what the nurses
have scheduled for her.

12:10.243 --> 12:13.906
A devoted son.
Devoted and desperate?

12:15.314 --> 12:18.841
She looks like a nice person.
They told me she had a child.

12:18.918 --> 12:21.386
A son. Her name's Vanessa Nikos.

12:21.454 --> 12:23.319
We're wondering if
you've ever heard of her.

12:23.389 --> 12:26.483
No. They also told me
that the kidney she gave me

12:26.559 --> 12:28.493
she herself got
from another donor.

12:29.929 --> 12:33.023
Third-hand or not, I'm
grateful. Excuse me.

12:33.866 --> 12:36.562
In addition to free air
filters for the home,

12:36.636 --> 12:39.628
we will offer a stop-smoking
program for the parents.

12:39.705 --> 12:41.536
Starting a non-profit?

12:41.607 --> 12:45.703
Breathing Free, for asthma kids in
Harlem. I founded it three years ago.

12:46.179 --> 12:48.545
I haven't had the
energy to grow it.

12:48.614 --> 12:53.415
It's hard to do. All that good
work can't pay much of a salary.

12:54.287 --> 12:56.278
Your son help you out?
Yes.

12:56.355 --> 13:00.451
He's a proofreader at Columbia,
in the Biology Department.

13:01.928 --> 13:03.987
Sorry. Mom,
I'm gonna have to go.

13:04.063 --> 13:07.555
Brian, these detectives are working
on that young woman's murder.

13:07.633 --> 13:09.601
The one who gave
your mother her kidney.

13:09.669 --> 13:12.001
Yeah, that's
a picture of her.

13:12.705 --> 13:16.801
Vanessa.
She had a son, too.

13:18.778 --> 13:22.077
I'm sorry for her family.
She saved my mother's life.

13:22.148 --> 13:25.845
Columbia. Your mother said that
you work in the Biology Department.

13:25.918 --> 13:27.852
Is that what you
studied? Biology?

13:27.920 --> 13:30.047
It was my major,
but I had to withdraw.

13:30.123 --> 13:33.820
Between his job and getting me to
dialysis, Brian couldn't do it all.

13:33.893 --> 13:35.918
He's put his whole
life on hold for you.

13:35.995 --> 13:38.589
I bet you were in a
hurry to see her get well.

13:38.664 --> 13:39.653
Sure.

13:39.732 --> 13:42.166
Oh, the waiting infuriated him.

13:42.235 --> 13:46.171
He was always checking the
Transplant Network, writing letters.

13:46.239 --> 13:49.766
Being a biologist, you
must've been on top of it.

13:50.510 --> 13:53.479
Rare blood types, matching tissue.

13:54.147 --> 13:58.083
Did you see her, Mrs. Nikos, when
they brought her into the E. R?

13:58.151 --> 14:01.052
No. I was up in
the dialysis ward.

14:01.120 --> 14:03.452
That's where all the good-looking
nurses are, in the E.R.

14:03.523 --> 14:05.582
We heard you like
to chat up the nurses.

14:05.658 --> 14:07.785
I was with my mom. They
messed up her appointment.

14:07.860 --> 14:10.658
That's right.
They almost sent me home.

14:10.730 --> 14:13.722
It was 10:00 before a chair freed up.

14:14.634 --> 14:16.761
I got to get to work, okay?

14:22.441 --> 14:25.433
His mother gets her
life back, he gets his.

14:25.511 --> 14:27.240
It all works out for him.

14:28.381 --> 14:32.681
Nearly didn't. They almost sent
his mother home that morning.

14:34.153 --> 14:37.589
He had to make sure that she'd be
here when they brought Vanessa in.

14:37.657 --> 14:41.320
He had to call the shooter,
to hold off until he was sure.

14:43.329 --> 14:45.695
He couldn't use his
cell phone.

14:45.765 --> 14:48.256
Maybe they have
payphones up in dialysis.

14:50.570 --> 14:53.004
This kid didn't just pick
Vanessa out of the phone book.

14:53.072 --> 14:54.767
Though he might've,
virtually.

14:54.840 --> 14:57.434
The Internet is full of
people appealing for donors.

14:57.510 --> 15:00.502
They list their blood types,
their city of residence.

15:00.580 --> 15:03.105
I got the dumps off the
payphone on the dialysis floor.

15:03.182 --> 15:06.845
There were about 20 calls between
9:00 and 10:00 that morning.

15:06.919 --> 15:11.754
They all check out, except for these
three calls placed to the same number.

15:11.824 --> 15:15.021
A disposable, no-name cell
phone. Maybe Brian's accomplice?

15:15.094 --> 15:17.688
I'm getting tired of sentences
that start with "maybe. "

15:17.763 --> 15:20.960
Well, how about the phone company
matched the phone's serial number

15:21.033 --> 15:24.230
to the minute cards the user
bought to load up the phone?

15:24.303 --> 15:28.000
The cards trace back to
a store on Delancey Street.

15:28.074 --> 15:32.033
Maybe. Pass this
around the store.

15:32.111 --> 15:34.375
See if anybody
hears ring tones.

15:38.117 --> 15:43.145
Excuse me, I want to give you these
hypo-allergenic pillows for the asthma kids.

15:43.222 --> 15:45.486
They're still in their
original packaging.

15:45.558 --> 15:48.220
I'm sorry, sir, but we're
not ready to accept equipment.

15:48.294 --> 15:52.162
Not ready? Sarah Edgars is getting
out of the hospital next week.

15:52.231 --> 15:55.200
You people better get your act
together. She's got important work to do.

15:55.268 --> 15:59.534
Yes, thank you. And thank
you for your donation.

15:59.605 --> 16:03.837
A lot of work went into
this. Don't let Sarah fail.

16:03.909 --> 16:05.308
Just don't let her fail.

16:24.063 --> 16:26.861
Looks like our guy in the sketch.

16:31.337 --> 16:34.602
Jesse Aparicio, 43.

16:34.674 --> 16:37.768
Still got one of the phone
cards he bought at the store.

16:41.647 --> 16:44.548
Central, we've got
a DOA gunshot wound.

16:44.617 --> 16:47.586
117 Rivington,
Apartment 3-David.

16:47.653 --> 16:50.486
Notify the ME
and send a bus.

16:51.123 --> 16:54.058
This wound, looks like
the skull exploded.

16:56.729 --> 17:00.927
Shooter would've had his muzzle
tight up against his head.

17:01.267 --> 17:05.431
And the gasses from the gunshot,
they went into the skull.

17:05.503 --> 17:09.941
As they expanded, they had no places
to go but back out the entry wound.

17:10.576 --> 17:13.807
The shooter would've
been covered in blowback.

17:14.847 --> 17:16.747
Oxygen tank?

17:17.116 --> 17:19.448
Must've been overdoing
it at the gym.

17:22.088 --> 17:25.285
Spirometry tests.
It's for lung function.

17:25.358 --> 17:27.451
This might tell us why.

17:29.528 --> 17:34.261
Two chest x-rays
taken seven years apart.

17:36.168 --> 17:39.069
No tumors, broken bones.

17:42.475 --> 17:43.908
It looks like

17:47.546 --> 17:51.312
the ribs got wider
apart over time.

17:53.085 --> 17:55.713
That could be
from emphysema.

17:56.122 --> 17:59.751
His days would've been numbered,
unless he had a new lung.

18:00.459 --> 18:05.021
A lung for a kidney? Maybe his
reward for shooting Vanessa.

18:09.235 --> 18:12.227
The jeweler ID'd Aparicio
as Vanessa's shooter.

18:12.304 --> 18:15.637
He was shot with the same
gun he used on her, a. 357.

18:15.708 --> 18:17.505
He had two priors
for assault.

18:18.844 --> 18:22.712
And he had defective airbags.
You confirm with his clinic?

18:22.782 --> 18:24.773
They said he had
congenital emphysema.

18:24.850 --> 18:28.013
He was on a waiting list
for a transplant at NYU.

18:29.655 --> 18:32.954
Middle-aged guy,
single, no kids.

18:33.025 --> 18:34.253
Not a priority candidate.

18:34.326 --> 18:36.624
They figured he was a
six-year wait, minimum.

18:36.695 --> 18:41.029
He was buying time by exercising
to reduce his need for oxygen.

18:41.100 --> 18:44.092
Murder probably didn't sound so
bad if he got a lung out of it.

18:44.170 --> 18:45.159
Question is, whose lung?

18:45.237 --> 18:46.602
Somebody with
B- negative blood.

18:46.672 --> 18:49.664
He had the same blood type
as Vanessa and Brian's mom.

18:49.742 --> 18:51.676
You still need to connect
the dots on Brian Edgars.

18:51.744 --> 18:53.405
Working on it.

18:53.946 --> 18:58.508
This is a letter from Aparicio's
employer dated last month,

18:58.584 --> 19:00.779
granting his request for an unpaid,

19:00.853 --> 19:04.482
two-month medical leave
starting next week.

19:04.557 --> 19:07.185
Two months would cover the
transplant and the recovery.

19:07.259 --> 19:10.251
Well, the only way that he could've
scheduled it that far in advance is

19:10.329 --> 19:14.698
if he was getting his
lung from a living donor.

19:17.069 --> 19:18.331
Vanessa's kidney,

19:18.571 --> 19:20.539
the one that she got three years ago,

19:20.606 --> 19:24.474
her mother said it was from
a living donor, a stranger.

19:25.678 --> 19:29.546
Now, living organ
donations from strangers.

19:31.050 --> 19:32.415
How common can that be?

19:32.485 --> 19:35.682
Here. The report on
Vanessa's kidney transplant.

19:35.754 --> 19:41.056
It was done at Hudson Medical
by Drs. Shimo and Myers.

19:42.761 --> 19:45.924
Six months ago,
Aparicio signed a release

19:46.398 --> 19:49.959
to allow the clinic to send
his medical files to Dr. Myers.

19:50.302 --> 19:53.169
Sounds like Dr. Myers runs
his own transplant network.

19:55.174 --> 19:57.369
It's possible I might've done a consult.

19:57.443 --> 19:59.343
I review a lot of these
cases. Why do you ask?

19:59.411 --> 20:01.936
We believe he might've
had a transplant scheduled

20:02.014 --> 20:03.447
for next week with a living donor.

20:03.516 --> 20:05.347
You know anything about it?

20:05.684 --> 20:08.983
No.
Mr. Aparicio say I do?

20:09.321 --> 20:10.913
He's not saying much
of anything anymore.

20:10.990 --> 20:15.290
Somebody performed brain surgery
on him with a. 357 Magnum.

20:15.361 --> 20:17.124
That's unfortunate.

20:17.196 --> 20:22.964
Yeah, and no. He was a suspect
in another murder last week.

20:25.004 --> 20:29.805
Vanessa Nikos.
Kidney, three years ago.

20:31.777 --> 20:33.438
Yes, I remember.

20:34.947 --> 20:36.744
You do her surgery?

20:36.815 --> 20:39.340
I harvested the kidney
from the donor.

20:39.418 --> 20:41.545
Well, you'll be happy
to know it wasn't for nothing.

20:41.620 --> 20:43.087
After Vanessa was killed,

20:43.155 --> 20:46.124
the kidney was transplanted
into Sarah Edgars.

20:47.092 --> 20:51.222
Another familiar name? We
checked with her physician.

20:51.297 --> 20:54.494
He said that he sent you
her records three years ago.

20:54.567 --> 20:56.899
Apparently, there was
a prospective donor.

20:56.969 --> 20:59.199
Yes, but the donor
changed their mind.

20:59.271 --> 21:01.239
They picked
Vanessa Nikos instead?

21:01.307 --> 21:03.366
I can't discuss that with you.

21:03.576 --> 21:07.205
Well, how about discussing if Sarah
Edgars' son Brian contacted you?

21:07.279 --> 21:09.975
He might have been angry
his mother wasn't chosen.

21:10.049 --> 21:13.507
He never contacted me. I
never met him or his mother.

21:13.586 --> 21:17.078
Anyway, who got what from
whom is subject to privilege.

21:20.025 --> 21:23.324
There's no reason he'd
be lying about Brian Edgars.

21:23.662 --> 21:28.122
Well, maybe what he's nervous
about has nothing to do with Brian.

21:28.734 --> 21:32.636
Myers is in the middle of
a lot of organ transactions.

21:32.705 --> 21:35.139
He might be running
an organ mill.

21:35.207 --> 21:40.110
Well, if he is, he'd have to collect a
finder's fee from Vanessa for the kidney.

21:40.980 --> 21:42.675
She didn't pay
Dr. Myers anything.

21:42.748 --> 21:44.340
I would've known.
She was living with me.

21:44.416 --> 21:46.475
Maybe she was told
not to say anything.

21:46.552 --> 21:49.521
She was putting herself through
school on a social worker's salary.

21:49.622 --> 21:52.887
And then the dialysis.
She had no money left over.

21:53.425 --> 21:55.325
Who paid for
the transplant?

21:55.394 --> 21:58.022
The donor did.
He paid for everything,

21:58.397 --> 22:01.093
even the drugs she had to
keep taking after the surgery.

22:01.166 --> 22:03.293
She was lucky
to find this guy.

22:03.369 --> 22:05.394
No, he found her.

22:05.938 --> 22:08.236
Dr. Myers called out
of the blue and said

22:08.307 --> 22:11.868
he had a patient who'd
seen her ad on the Internet.

22:11.944 --> 22:13.969
He picked her to
receive his kidney.

22:14.046 --> 22:15.775
Why her? Did he say?

22:16.181 --> 22:18.877
She only talked to him
once, at Dr. Myers' office.

22:18.951 --> 22:23.320
He said he wanted to help her
fulfill her good intentions.

22:23.389 --> 22:25.186
Did Vanessa keep
in touch with him?

22:25.257 --> 22:27.657
She didn't
even know his name.

22:27.726 --> 22:30.126
What about medical records,
release forms?

22:30.195 --> 22:31.753
Did he give her
anything like that?

22:31.830 --> 22:35.527
The only thing he gave her
after the surgery was this.

22:36.568 --> 22:39.969
Vanessa had mentioned
that she admired Gandhi.

22:40.039 --> 22:42.166
When Jake started walking,
she was afraid he'd break it,

22:42.241 --> 22:43.833
so she brought it here.

22:43.909 --> 22:45.399
It's heavy.

22:45.978 --> 22:47.070
These numbers.
Did you put them here?

22:47.146 --> 22:49.614
No. I always wondered
what they were for.

22:49.682 --> 22:52.480
It's an insurance ID
number. In case it's stolen,

22:52.551 --> 22:56.453
it can be traced back to the
owner, whether he likes it or not.

22:59.091 --> 23:00.615
My father marked it.

23:00.693 --> 23:04.459
He couldn't stand the thought of
losing one of his valuable possessions.

23:04.530 --> 23:10.491
So, you gave away his statue of
Gandhi. That's a bit of poetic justice.

23:11.470 --> 23:17.431
You know, but a kidney to a total stranger,
now that's a little out of the ordinary.

23:17.509 --> 23:20.501
Gifts like that usually
come with a hefty price tag.

23:20.579 --> 23:24.413
Well, I don't know what Vanessa's mother
told you, but I didn't sell my kidney.

23:24.483 --> 23:26.451
That would defeat the
purpose of the gift.

23:26.518 --> 23:28.213
Which is what?

23:28.287 --> 23:32.951
To do good by giving someone
else the opportunity to do good.

23:33.092 --> 23:36.619
Before she became ill,
Vanessa was doing social work.

23:36.695 --> 23:38.993
She was taking law classes.

23:39.064 --> 23:41.089
She wanted to be a
children's rights advocate.

23:41.166 --> 23:44.397
Well, I'm sure
she was deserving of it.

23:45.304 --> 23:47.067
But to put your
own life at risk is...

23:47.139 --> 23:49.573
Oh, I get by fine with one kidney.

23:49.641 --> 23:51.632
But her blood type
was so rare that

23:51.710 --> 23:55.544
the chances of Vanessa receiving
a transplant were remote.

23:55.781 --> 23:59.512
Denying her my kidney would've
been tantamount to murder.

24:00.252 --> 24:03.016
That's a pretty extreme view,
Mr. Wainwright.

24:03.088 --> 24:06.717
So if I don't donate a kidney,
that makes me a murderer?

24:06.992 --> 24:09.483
You're the only one
who can answer that.

24:09.561 --> 24:12.621
This picture
was taken out West?

24:13.398 --> 24:16.925
At a Navajo Nation reservation.
I spent a year there teaching.

24:17.002 --> 24:18.936
You brought the family?

24:19.004 --> 24:22.531
I used to think that you had
to be a good person to do good.

24:22.608 --> 24:27.739
I'm teaching my kids you become
a good person by doing good.

24:28.247 --> 24:32.479
And now, your son volunteers
at inner-city schools.

24:32.918 --> 24:36.547
No, that's his school.
Those are his classmates.

24:36.922 --> 24:41.655
Oh, I thought, you know, the
sweatshirt. It said "Packard Academy. "

24:41.727 --> 24:45.527
Yeah, yeah, he used to go there. I
took both my kids out of private school.

24:45.597 --> 24:49.761
We used their tuition to buy
supplies for their new school.

24:50.702 --> 24:54.399
Before you picked Vanessa to get your
kidney, were there any other contenders?

24:54.473 --> 24:57.067
There weren't very many
candidates with my blood type.

24:57.142 --> 25:00.873
How about Sarah Edgars? Was
she someone you considered?

25:00.946 --> 25:02.607
She might've been.

25:03.215 --> 25:06.013
Do you have a...

25:06.084 --> 25:07.381
Oh, sure.

25:08.453 --> 25:14.050
Reason we ask is, your surgeon
reviewed Sarah's file three years ago.

25:14.126 --> 25:17.926
She was a single mom trying to start
a program for asthma kids in Harlem.

25:17.996 --> 25:20.021
Yes, I remember now.

25:20.098 --> 25:22.589
Well, it all worked out
for Sarah in the end.

25:22.668 --> 25:28.072
After Vanessa was shot, that
kidney was transplanted into Sarah.

25:30.843 --> 25:34.711
Life's a funny old dog,
isn't it, Mr. Wainwright?

25:34.780 --> 25:38.580
I'm just grateful something
good happened from this tragedy.

25:39.117 --> 25:42.484
Right. Thanks for the pen.

25:42.788 --> 25:44.915
Please, keep it.
Oh, come on.

25:45.591 --> 25:46.922
It's very expensive. I can't.

25:46.992 --> 25:48.550
No, I don't need it.

25:49.394 --> 25:52.557
I want you to have it.
I mean that.

25:55.067 --> 25:56.694
You cut yourself shaving, huh?

25:56.768 --> 26:02.502
No. I dropped a glass in the sink
yesterday and a piece flew up, cut me.

26:02.574 --> 26:03.973
Ouch!

26:06.345 --> 26:07.573
Well,

26:11.083 --> 26:13.210
thanks for the pen.

26:21.560 --> 26:24.495
You'll have to send it
back to him. Yeah, I know.

26:24.563 --> 26:26.861
I just wanted to see how much
he enjoyed giving it away.

26:26.932 --> 26:28.524
Didn't look like
he enjoyed it at all.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.465
It's as if he
was compelled.

26:30.936 --> 26:36.033
As if giving was serious
business. Deadly serious.

26:38.477 --> 26:43.039
I wonder how offended he would be if
he knew his gift was being squandered.

26:46.551 --> 26:48.485
I don't know
much about her transplant.

26:48.553 --> 26:50.350
I met her a couple of months after.

26:50.422 --> 26:54.188
But you knew somebody was covering
her bills for immunosuppressive drugs?

26:54.259 --> 26:57.786
Yeah, sure, a foundation.
The Comte Foundation.

26:57.863 --> 26:59.888
The bills used to
go directly to them.

27:01.266 --> 27:02.528
Used to?

27:03.035 --> 27:05.265
The foundation stopped
paying the bills.

27:05.337 --> 27:07.134
The hospital started sending them to us.

27:07.239 --> 27:08.729
When did this happen?

27:08.807 --> 27:11.139
Right after Jake was born.

27:11.209 --> 27:14.440
Vanessa didn't tell her mother.
She didn't want her worrying.

27:14.513 --> 27:17.107
Vanessa was on maternity
leave from Social Services.

27:17.182 --> 27:19.309
Three months was when she
had to go back to work?

27:19.384 --> 27:22.444
Yes, but she decided not to.

27:22.521 --> 27:23.647
Her mother said that

27:23.722 --> 27:26.190
Vanessa was taking law
classes before Jake came along.

27:26.258 --> 27:27.589
Did she drop out?

27:27.659 --> 27:29.524
Last fall.

27:29.795 --> 27:32.423
Last fall.
Six months ago?

27:32.497 --> 27:35.466
She decided to take
jewelry classes instead.

27:35.534 --> 27:40.665
Daddy!
Come here, Daddy!

27:41.707 --> 27:45.768
Six months ago. That's when
Myers got Aparicio's file.

27:47.279 --> 27:49.804
Wainwright soured on Vanessa?

27:50.315 --> 27:53.443
He might've promised Aparicio a
new lung in return for shooting her.

27:53.518 --> 27:56.749
And Aparicio was stupid
enough to believe him.

27:58.623 --> 28:03.856
Wainwright. He might've given
him a good reason to believe.

28:03.929 --> 28:07.660
You know, he was scratching his
side back and forth along a line.

28:07.733 --> 28:11.100
And when an incision heals
and the skin knits together,

28:11.169 --> 28:12.568
it itches.

28:14.773 --> 28:17.936
Wainwright had access to
Sarah Edgars' medical file.

28:18.010 --> 28:20.035
He could've found out
her dialysis schedule.

28:20.112 --> 28:24.014
He might've been the one who called
Aparicio from the dialysis floor.

28:24.082 --> 28:26.346
Maybe Wainwright's a little
intense in the charity department,

28:26.418 --> 28:28.386
but two murders over a kidney?

28:28.453 --> 28:32.446
Well, it's not about
a kidney, or even charity.

28:32.524 --> 28:35.925
The ME tracked Dr. Myers'
surgeries for the last three years.

28:35.994 --> 28:38.963
This lists the types of surgeries,
but not the patients' names.

28:39.031 --> 28:40.896
The good doctor likes
to keep his hands wet.

28:40.966 --> 28:44.595
Three years ago, he harvested
a kidney from a male patient,

28:44.669 --> 28:46.227
age 41,
B- negative blood.

28:46.304 --> 28:47.498
That would be Wainwright.

28:47.572 --> 28:49.904
<i>A year later, male patient,
42, B-negative blood.</i>

28:49.975 --> 28:52.170
This time, Myers assisted
on a bone marrow transplant.

28:52.244 --> 28:54.644
Wainwright again.
Then, last September,

28:54.713 --> 28:57.011
male patient, 43,
B- negative blood.

28:57.082 --> 29:00.279
Myers harvested half
a liver for a transplant.

29:00.352 --> 29:02.616
He's giving himself
away, piece by piece.

29:02.687 --> 29:04.917
To people who he thinks
will save the world.

29:04.990 --> 29:07.754
I guess stay-at-home
moms don't count.

29:09.127 --> 29:11.789
Princeton's a very
good school, James.

29:11.863 --> 29:15.355
But an education's only as
good as what you do with it.

29:15.967 --> 29:17.229
I know what you mean, sir.

29:21.139 --> 29:23.903
What's going to happen to Building
Blocks while you're at Princeton?

29:23.975 --> 29:25.567
Oh, this is the best part.

29:25.644 --> 29:29.011
I talked them into hitting up their
alumni for a grant to start production.

29:31.249 --> 29:33.479
Well, you're off to
a good start, James.

29:34.753 --> 29:37.881
Dr. Myers'll be in touch with your
parents by the end of the week.

29:37.956 --> 29:39.082
They really wanted to meet you, sir.

29:39.157 --> 29:41.284
No, no, no.
That's not necessary.

29:41.359 --> 29:44.624
But you understand, James,
that once you've said yes,

29:44.696 --> 29:47.927
all your plans, all the
people who depend on you,

29:49.601 --> 29:51.626
you can't disappoint them.

29:51.703 --> 29:53.762
No, sir,
I won't let you down.

29:57.809 --> 29:59.470
Thanks for coming.

30:00.645 --> 30:02.408
Thank you.

30:03.348 --> 30:04.508
Thank you so much.

30:12.023 --> 30:14.116
Wainwright
made over 30 million

30:14.192 --> 30:16.490
brokering air rights
to real estate developers.

30:16.561 --> 30:20.554
Then, five years ago, he gave it
all away to hospitals, schools.

30:20.632 --> 30:24.363
He left just enough to cover follow-up
care for his transplant recipients.

30:24.436 --> 30:25.869
Extreme altruism.

30:25.937 --> 30:27.928
I guess it was only a matter of time.

30:28.006 --> 30:29.598
Well, there's no joy
in it. It's compulsive.

30:29.674 --> 30:31.972
It satisfies
some deep-seated need.

30:32.043 --> 30:35.376
Unbalanced as he may be,
it's not direct evidence

30:35.447 --> 30:37.244
that he was responsible
for either murder.

30:37.315 --> 30:40.751
There might be evidence in his
closet. The force of the gunshot

30:40.819 --> 30:44.516
would've blown the back of Aparicio's
head onto Wainwright's clothes.

30:44.589 --> 30:46.921
I don't see probable cause for a search.

30:46.992 --> 30:49.984
Was he seen near
Mr. Aparicio's home?

30:50.061 --> 30:53.827
No. But a witness puts him at the
offices of Sarah Edgars' asthma project

30:53.899 --> 30:55.298
three days after her
transplant.

30:55.367 --> 30:58.859
And two days before he told us
he had trouble remembering her.

30:59.304 --> 31:01.431
That should satisfy a judge.

31:03.508 --> 31:05.703
It's a chilling proposition.

31:05.944 --> 31:07.377
By accepting
an organ donation,

31:07.445 --> 31:10.243
you take on an obligation to live right.

31:10.315 --> 31:11.942
Or else.

31:14.886 --> 31:18.913
My husband's a highly moral
man who acts on his convictions.

31:18.990 --> 31:22.084
You and your husband are on
the same page? Completely.

31:22.160 --> 31:24.856
Even about sending your
kids to public school?

31:24.930 --> 31:27.558
We don't want them growing
up in an elitist environment.

31:27.632 --> 31:29.691
My brother's a fireman,
his wife's a nurse,

31:29.768 --> 31:33.704
but they pinch pennies to send their kid
to private school. They think it's worth it.

31:33.772 --> 31:37.401
Perhaps it is, if they
can afford it. We can't.

31:41.613 --> 31:42.773
Looks like you
hit a sore spot.

31:42.847 --> 31:44.940
There's plenty
more to hit. Look.

31:45.517 --> 31:47.542
No woman with
a 40- slot shoe rack

31:47.619 --> 31:50.884
willingly walks around in
one pair of crappy shoes.

31:54.859 --> 31:58.454
I'm surprised you're not more
concerned for your husband.

31:59.197 --> 32:00.926
You should be.

32:01.233 --> 32:03.394
I know Boyce
is no murderer.

32:05.203 --> 32:06.534
Well, I wasn't
thinking about that.

32:06.605 --> 32:08.436
I was thinking
about his health.

32:08.506 --> 32:09.666
You know,
the surgeries.

32:09.741 --> 32:11.641
He's under a
doctor's supervision.

32:11.710 --> 32:13.644
Myers, right?

32:13.845 --> 32:17.110
Ever occur to you that
your husband might be

32:18.383 --> 32:21.147
paying him off to
okay those surgeries?

32:22.520 --> 32:24.750
He's had a psychiatric
evaluation.

32:24.823 --> 32:26.757
I mean, that's standard
for living donors.

32:26.825 --> 32:28.417
I mean, especially someone who just,

32:29.027 --> 32:31.552
you know, out of the blue,
gives up money, a nice home...

32:31.630 --> 32:33.689
It wasn't
out of the blue.

32:34.099 --> 32:36.158
Boyce has always wanted
to help, to do more.

32:36.234 --> 32:38.293
He burns to do more.

32:38.370 --> 32:40.463
"He burns to... " His words?

32:40.672 --> 32:44.199
He says his goal
is moral ecstasy.

32:44.476 --> 32:46.569
Where does he get these
ideas? Maybe from his parents?

32:46.645 --> 32:50.741
We saw the statue of Gandhi
that belonged to his father.

32:50.815 --> 32:52.214
He a big philanthropist?

32:52.284 --> 32:55.048
He's charitable to outsiders.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.917
Not to his family? Not to Boyce?

32:57.222 --> 32:59.622
It's a private matter.

33:00.458 --> 33:05.157
Be careful of your bare feet, 'cause
Boyce said that he broke a glass.

33:05.230 --> 33:06.595
He had a Band-Aid.

33:06.665 --> 33:09.725
He said that it
flew up and cut him.

33:09.801 --> 33:12.895
That was last week.
He said he swept it all up.

33:18.777 --> 33:21.405
He said yesterday.
She said last week.

33:22.947 --> 33:26.508
Last week,
when Aparicio was shot.

33:28.053 --> 33:31.784
The blowback, it would've been
more than brains and blood.

33:31.856 --> 33:33.881
There would've been bone.

33:34.693 --> 33:36.285
This isn't some simple blood test

33:36.361 --> 33:37.953
Mr. Carver's asking for,
Your Honor.

33:38.029 --> 33:39.690
He wants the Court's
permission to dig around

33:39.764 --> 33:41.857
my client's neck
for a piece of bone.

33:41.933 --> 33:43.798
It's highly invasive.

33:43.868 --> 33:47.326
Before we do any digging, Your Honor, we want to x
- ray Mr. Wainwright

33:47.405 --> 33:51.398
to determine that there is a
foreign object embedded in his neck.

33:51.476 --> 33:53.944
I don't see a problem
with an x-ray, Ms. Romero.

33:54.012 --> 33:56.446
We'll save
Mr. Carver the trouble.

33:57.082 --> 33:59.949
As this x-ray shows,
there is an object,

34:00.018 --> 34:03.545
a piece of glass, just as Mr.
Wainwright told the detectives.

34:03.621 --> 34:07.421
Well, I see it. Mr. Carver?

34:08.226 --> 34:10.853
Thank you, Your Honor.

34:11.730 --> 34:13.197
I see an object.

34:13.264 --> 34:15.596
It could be glass,
bone, anything.

34:15.667 --> 34:18.158
Let's get it out and take a look at it.

34:18.235 --> 34:19.533
It's not that simple.

34:19.603 --> 34:22.801
The object has worked its way into
the fascia of the neck structure.

34:22.873 --> 34:25.308
Removing it would require
putting Mr. Wainwright

34:25.377 --> 34:27.242
under
general anesthesia.

34:27.312 --> 34:29.303
As this study shows,
Your Honor,

34:29.380 --> 34:32.612
more people die under general
anesthesia than in car accidents.

34:32.684 --> 34:37.018
Your Honor, Ms. Romero vastly
overstates the risks to her client.

34:37.088 --> 34:38.851
Not from what I'm reading.

34:39.858 --> 34:41.449
You can't even tell
me with any certainty

34:41.525 --> 34:43.426
what Mr. Wainwright has in his neck.

34:43.962 --> 34:46.862
I'm denying your motion,
Mr. Carver.

34:47.532 --> 34:48.862
Let's go.

34:53.103 --> 34:55.766
Jerry, the clerk's
office made mistakes...

34:55.840 --> 34:57.899
I hope you
have a plan B.

34:57.976 --> 35:02.743
The x-ray. It was taken from a side
angle. It featured the left lung.

35:02.814 --> 35:05.180
I noticed that the name of
the doctor was blacked out.

35:05.250 --> 35:07.241
Ten to one, it's Myers.

35:07.318 --> 35:09.343
Wainwright's planning
another donation?

35:09.421 --> 35:11.514
He's the gift that just keeps giving.

35:14.692 --> 35:17.092
Where did you get this information?
It's supposed to be confidential.

35:17.162 --> 35:19.528
No confidentiality has been broken.

35:19.597 --> 35:24.466
But we learned that Dr. Myers has a
lung transplant scheduled next month

35:24.536 --> 35:27.334
for a 17-year-old male
with B-negative blood.

35:27.405 --> 35:31.967
Now, that fits the profile of James that
you posted on the Transplant Network.

35:32.043 --> 35:34.341
We didn't do anything wrong.
We haven't broken any laws.

35:34.412 --> 35:37.142
We're just trying to save our
son's life. He has cystic fibrosis.

35:39.184 --> 35:41.914
What do you know about the donor?

35:41.986 --> 35:45.717
Nothing. It's an anonymous
gift from a living person.

35:45.790 --> 35:48.020
A good person who
wants to help James.

35:48.092 --> 35:52.426
But you've met this
good person, haven't you?

35:56.034 --> 35:57.558
Met him, James?

35:59.637 --> 36:00.661
He's just this cool guy.

36:00.738 --> 36:03.263
He wants me to be healthy
and reach my goals.

36:03.341 --> 36:05.002
He's giving Jamie
a great gift.

36:05.076 --> 36:08.705
His gifts come with
big strings attached.

36:09.848 --> 36:14.148
Three years ago, he donated
a kidney to this woman.

36:14.586 --> 36:17.851
She was planning a career
defending children's rights.

36:17.922 --> 36:22.188
And when she changed her mind, he
stopped paying her medical bills.

36:22.260 --> 36:26.890
And we believe
he had her killed.

36:29.467 --> 36:33.062
What do you expect us to do
about it? Even if it's true?

36:33.137 --> 36:35.537
He's going to
save our son's life.

36:35.607 --> 36:37.700
You're not going to stop him, are you?

36:39.344 --> 36:43.246
"Building Blocks. "
Is this your project?

36:44.916 --> 36:46.281
It's a school-in-a-box.

36:46.351 --> 36:48.945
A whole kit for a
classroom for 30 kids

36:49.020 --> 36:52.615
with walls, chairs, and desks,
all made out of hardened cardboard.

36:52.690 --> 36:54.681
You designed it?
Yes.

36:54.759 --> 36:58.786
It's for natural disaster
areas, war zones, refugee camps.

36:58.863 --> 37:01.388
I already built a prototype,
and next year at Princeton,

37:01.466 --> 37:04.333
we'll design a plant
to mass produce them.

37:09.674 --> 37:14.668
Well, you just, you know,
go ahead with your plans.

37:15.346 --> 37:20.909
And we'll talk to the D.A.,
and we won't stop your surgery.

37:23.988 --> 37:27.082
Since Mr. Wainwright will
already be under anesthesia

37:27.158 --> 37:30.127
when he donates a lobe
of his lung next month,

37:30.194 --> 37:34.597
having the State's doctor remove
the object from his neck at that time

37:34.666 --> 37:37.464
won't pose any
additional risk to him.

37:38.369 --> 37:39.631
Is this true,
Mr. Wainwright?

37:39.704 --> 37:42.969
Are you donating a part of
your lung to this young man?

37:43.041 --> 37:47.978
Yes, Your Honor. James Raphael has an
important contribution to make to society,

37:48.046 --> 37:51.812
and he won't have the chance to
make it unless he gets this gift.

37:51.883 --> 37:52.941
Your Honor, if I may...

37:53.017 --> 37:54.609
Your client said
all I need to hear.

37:54.686 --> 37:57.052
I'm granting Mr. Carver's motion.

37:57.121 --> 37:59.180
When Mr. Wainwright
undergoes lung surgery,

37:59.257 --> 38:01.851
the State will be allowed to
remove the object from his neck.

38:01.926 --> 38:05.726
Then, Your Honor, my client chooses
not to participate in the transplant.

38:05.797 --> 38:06.923
Your Honor...

38:06.998 --> 38:09.057
It's elective surgery. He
can't be compelled to do it.

38:09.133 --> 38:10.691
She's correct, Mr. Carver.

38:10.768 --> 38:14.397
Unless Mr. Wainwright voluntarily
puts himself under anesthesia,

38:14.472 --> 38:18.408
your doctor can't go near
him. Now I'm due back in court.

38:18.876 --> 38:23.210
Mr. Wainwright, if you're thinking of
having surgery in another state, be advised

38:23.281 --> 38:25.772
I'll lodge this order
in that jurisdiction

38:25.850 --> 38:28.819
where our doctor will be in the
operating room waiting for you.

38:28.886 --> 38:31.912
Don't get your hopes up, Mr. Carver.
There'll be no more surgeries.

38:31.990 --> 38:34.982
Well, it sounds like James
Raphael's out of luck.

38:35.059 --> 38:36.617
How can you people do this
to him?

38:36.694 --> 38:38.286
You're the
one doing it to him.

38:38.363 --> 38:41.059
You're the one taking
yourself out of the donor game.

38:41.132 --> 38:42.599
Spare him the guilt trip,
Detective.

38:42.667 --> 38:45.568
This is my call. He's
following my advice.

38:45.637 --> 38:49.698
She has no idea what
she's condemning you to.

38:49.774 --> 38:53.608
I know how much you
burn to do more, to give.

38:53.811 --> 38:56.439
He'll find other outlets
for his generosity.

38:56.514 --> 39:00.177
He's already run through the other
options, all 30 million bucks.

39:00.652 --> 39:04.486
Giving away that money was the
easiest thing in the world for Boyce.

39:04.789 --> 39:06.848
Money made how?

39:07.191 --> 39:11.958
By buying and selling what?
The air above our heads,

39:12.363 --> 39:16.424
so some egomaniac can build
some 90-story skyscraper

39:16.501 --> 39:17.832
and put his name on it.

39:19.270 --> 39:23.764
It was a parasitical business.

39:23.841 --> 39:25.672
"Parasitical. "

39:25.743 --> 39:27.040
Is that a word that your

39:27.111 --> 39:30.046
philanthropic parents
used to ridicule you?

39:30.615 --> 39:32.879
We read up
on your mom and dad.

39:32.950 --> 39:34.008
They've given away
a fortune.

39:34.085 --> 39:36.576
Not just in money,
but in time.

39:36.654 --> 39:40.021
Their whole lives are
dedicated to public service.

39:40.358 --> 39:45.159
My father was a trust fund kid.
What he gave cost him nothing.

39:45.229 --> 39:48.721
You mean, in his heart,
he was stingy?

39:49.200 --> 39:53.136
Stingy with his love?

39:53.905 --> 39:56.635
Stingy with his praise
for you?

39:56.708 --> 39:58.107
But you got one up on him.

39:58.776 --> 40:01.574
I mean, he could dismiss
your business achievements,

40:01.646 --> 40:03.273
but not your altruism.

40:03.347 --> 40:06.316
What I do is so far
beyond his comprehension.

40:06.384 --> 40:10.582
Whatever your reasons for parceling
yourself out to save humanity,

40:10.655 --> 40:12.782
it's over now,
thanks to your attorney.

40:12.857 --> 40:15.052
I'm just protecting
his interests.

40:15.126 --> 40:17.253
Where does that
leave you, Boyce?

40:17.328 --> 40:20.456
Stalled on the road of moral ecstasy.

40:20.898 --> 40:24.095
Where does it leave James
Raphael and anybody else

40:24.168 --> 40:26.329
whose lives you could
save with your gifts?

40:26.871 --> 40:31.001
Now, are you sacrificing their
lives to stay out of prison?

40:31.476 --> 40:33.410
Doesn't that
make you a murderer?

40:33.478 --> 40:34.945
That makes
him no such thing.

40:35.012 --> 40:36.445
That's what he told us.

40:36.514 --> 40:40.109
"Denying somebody an organ
is tantamount to murder. "

40:40.184 --> 40:44.712
Right, Boyce? You know,
I read that 17 people,

40:44.789 --> 40:47.587
they die every day
waiting for an organ.

40:48.426 --> 40:53.386
And here you are with plenty of organs
left. I mean, you have the two lobes

40:53.464 --> 40:56.729
from that lung. And your
pancreas, part of your intestine,

40:56.801 --> 40:59.634
even more bone marrow. I mean,
you could give your other kidney.

40:59.704 --> 41:01.365
I mean, why not? You
could live off of dialysis.

41:01.439 --> 41:03.407
Boyce, we're leaving.

41:07.845 --> 41:10.473
That's six more people
you'll murder.

41:10.548 --> 41:13.540
Six more Albert Schweitzers,
six more Nelson Mandelas,

41:13.618 --> 41:16.143
six more Harriet Tubmans.

41:17.622 --> 41:21.114
You'd squander their lives
for your own personal freedom.

41:21.192 --> 41:23.387
I mean, what's more selfish
than your own personal freedom?

41:25.763 --> 41:29.460
I'm not selfish.
I'm a better person than that.

41:30.334 --> 41:34.293
Yeah. Yes, you need to
give, to give of yourself.

41:34.372 --> 41:40.436
You're insatiable. I know that about
you. You give life so you can live.

41:41.579 --> 41:43.103
Yes, that's
what it's like.

41:43.181 --> 41:46.480
So, Boyce, before you
make any more gifts,

41:46.551 --> 41:49.782
there's one gift you're
going to have to make.

41:50.521 --> 41:53.820
Give up your freedom.
Confess to your crimes.

41:53.891 --> 41:55.290
He has nothing to confess.

41:55.359 --> 41:58.590
Mr. Wainwright, as a
condition of a plea bargain,

41:58.663 --> 42:03.259
you'll be allowed to make your organ
donations while serving your sentence.

42:11.342 --> 42:13.833
That's right.
Think about it, Boyce.

42:13.911 --> 42:19.781
No matter the bad you've done, those
good deeds, they'll be something

42:20.852 --> 42:25.414
no one, not even your father,
can take away from you.

42:35.533 --> 42:37.364
All right, I'll tell you.
Boyce, no.

42:37.435 --> 42:42.031
I killed Jesse Aparicio. I promised
him my lung for shooting Vanessa.

42:43.975 --> 42:46.535
She made a commitment.
She should've stuck to it.

42:46.611 --> 42:50.377
I didn't give her my kidney so that
she could marry and make babies.

42:50.448 --> 42:52.211
She would've died three years
ago if it weren't for me.

42:52.283 --> 42:54.251
And she's dead now because of you.

42:54.318 --> 42:57.446
You're under arrest
for murder, Mr. Wainwright.

43:08.232 --> 43:12.498
He gives new meaning to
"giving until it hurts. "

43:14.772 --> 43:17.206
He gives
because he hurts.
