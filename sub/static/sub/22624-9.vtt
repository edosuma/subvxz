00:01.369 --> 00:03.537
NARRATOR: Tonight, on
The Curse of Oak Island...

00:03.571 --> 00:05.706
This takes the information hunt
to another level.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.708
On his shield,
he's got this cross,

00:07.741 --> 00:10.178
-which is exactly like
the HO Stone. -Wow!

00:13.147 --> 00:14.315
RICK: There was a reference
to your family name.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.716
Are there Templar connections?

00:15.749 --> 00:18.186
There obviously is a connection.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.421
RICK: They're trying to relay
some sort of information.

00:20.454 --> 00:23.124
The secret's behind that wall.
This is a Templar cross.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.526
JERRY: These don't exist
anywhere else.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.461
-They only exist here.
-It's what we came for, really.

00:31.565 --> 00:35.069
NARRATOR: There is an island
in the North Atlantic

00:35.103 --> 00:38.406
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.439 --> 00:41.675
for more than 200 years.

00:41.709 --> 00:45.646
So far, they have found a stone
slab with strange symbols

00:45.679 --> 00:47.381
carved into it,

00:47.415 --> 00:49.583
17th-century coins,

00:49.617 --> 00:52.453
even pieces of human bone.

00:52.486 --> 00:55.256
To date, six men have died

00:55.289 --> 00:57.858
trying to solve the mystery.

00:57.891 --> 01:00.494
And, according to legend,

01:00.528 --> 01:03.231
one more will have to die

01:03.264 --> 01:06.434
before the treasure
can be found.

01:18.412 --> 01:20.481
After months of planning,

01:20.514 --> 01:23.351
and weeks of exploratory
drilling,

01:23.384 --> 01:25.753
the Laginas and their partners,

01:25.786 --> 01:29.557
with the help of an expert team
from Irving Equipment, Limited,

01:29.590 --> 01:33.561
are finally starting to dig
a large, 50-inch-wide hole

01:33.594 --> 01:35.896
into what they believe is
the location

01:35.929 --> 01:38.499
of the original
Oak Island Money Pit.

01:38.532 --> 01:41.435
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

01:41.469 --> 01:43.671
So, what's going on
today, Vanessa?

01:43.704 --> 01:45.739
So, you can see right now
they're lining up the casing

01:45.773 --> 01:48.209
so that they can
bolt it together.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.677
And then, as soon as they get
this one on,

01:49.710 --> 01:51.445
-we'll start excavating out.
-Great.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.547
We have got the first
ten feet, so now I think

01:53.581 --> 01:55.383
we're ready for Dave
in the loader.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.618
-Well, that's good.
-Yeah.

01:57.651 --> 02:01.622
MIKE: Coming down a little bit.
Good.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.591
All right, well,
they got that can lined up,

02:03.624 --> 02:06.460
-and gonna bolt it together.
-Yes.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.632
NARRATOR: So far,
the shaft has reached a depth

02:11.665 --> 02:14.568
of only ten feet,
slowed down by the size

02:14.602 --> 02:17.571
of the massive steel caissons.

02:17.605 --> 02:21.309
It will take at least another
four to five days

02:21.342 --> 02:24.512
before the team is able to
reach its initial target depth

02:24.545 --> 02:27.515
of 150 feet...

02:27.548 --> 02:29.283
roughly the same depth

02:29.317 --> 02:31.419
where treasure hunters
Frederick Blair

02:31.452 --> 02:33.954
and William Chappell
first discovered evidence

02:33.987 --> 02:38.326
of an elusive wooden box
containing traces of gold--

02:38.359 --> 02:41.362
a box which they dubbed
"The Chappell Vault."

02:44.298 --> 02:46.567
This year my anxiety's
a little high.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.302
-Yeah.

02:48.336 --> 02:49.603
'Cause I know we're gonna
find something.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.339
-Definitely.
-Oh, yeah.

02:51.372 --> 02:53.541
Perfect.

02:53.574 --> 02:54.908
NARRATOR: While waiting
for the team from Irving

02:54.942 --> 02:56.444
to reach target depth,

02:56.477 --> 02:58.612
Rick Lagina has journeyed

02:58.646 --> 03:00.881
some 3,000 miles
across the ocean

03:00.914 --> 03:03.384
to Paris, France.

03:03.417 --> 03:05.619
I bet you guys never thought
Oak Island would

03:05.653 --> 03:07.455
-No.

03:07.488 --> 03:10.524
NARRATOR: Traveling with two
of his nephews--

03:10.558 --> 03:12.693
Alex Lagina
and Peter Fornetti--

03:12.726 --> 03:14.862
Rick is eager to get
a first-hand look

03:14.895 --> 03:17.631
at some recently acquired
information...

03:17.665 --> 03:20.901
information which he hopes
can help validate

03:20.934 --> 03:22.903
an ancient treasure map
first presented to him

03:22.936 --> 03:24.738
one year ago

03:24.772 --> 03:28.342
by historian and researcher
Zena Halpern.

03:28.376 --> 03:31.445
Rick's curiosity was
further piqued

03:31.479 --> 03:33.581
when he recently received
information

03:33.614 --> 03:35.783
linking the Rochefoucauld
family--

03:35.816 --> 03:38.352
whose name appears in the upper
right-hand corner

03:38.386 --> 03:41.455
of Zena's map--
and a genealogy of families

03:41.489 --> 03:44.258
directly connected
to Oak Island.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.660
DOUG: Rochefoucauld. This is
a really interesting family

03:46.694 --> 03:49.463
because this is a family
of Crusader kings.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.434
NARRATOR:
Following up on this clue,

03:53.467 --> 03:55.536
Rick then hired
professional researcher

03:55.569 --> 03:58.572
and translator Nichola Lewis

03:58.606 --> 04:01.775
to further investigate
possible ties between

04:01.809 --> 04:03.677
the Rochefoucauld family
in France,

04:03.711 --> 04:06.680
the Knights Templar
and Oak Island.

04:06.714 --> 04:09.049
I have been in touch
with Sonia Matossian,

04:09.082 --> 04:12.286
who is a Rochefoucauld,
and she lives at the castle,

04:12.320 --> 04:14.955
at La Rochefoucauld itself.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.425
And I asked her
if she would be willing

04:17.458 --> 04:19.693
to meet you
and to show you around.

04:19.727 --> 04:21.729
I would very much
appreciate that.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.564
Sounds great, Nichola.
Looking forward to it.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.668
-RICK: Hi, Nichola.
How are you? -Hi, Rick.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.002
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.871
-Nice to meet you in person.
-Yeah.

04:30.904 --> 04:32.039
-Hello. -Nichola, nice to
finally meet you in person.

04:32.072 --> 04:33.474
Yeah, exactly.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.942
This is my nephew,
Peter Fornetti.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.677
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi. Good.

04:36.710 --> 04:37.911
So, look,
let's get on the train,

04:37.945 --> 04:40.314
sit down, get comfortable,

04:40.348 --> 04:42.983
and the three of us very much
look forward to what you have.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.753
That will be great, so we should
go and get the train right now.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.321
Absolutely.

04:47.355 --> 04:49.490
NARRATOR:
While making their way

04:49.523 --> 04:52.626
by train
some 300 miles southwest

04:52.660 --> 04:56.330
to the town
of Charente, France,

04:56.364 --> 04:59.032
Rick and his nephews fill
Nichola in on the progress

04:59.066 --> 05:03.504
they have made on Oak Island
so far this year--

05:03.537 --> 05:06.974
like the discovery
of 17th-century British coins;

05:07.007 --> 05:11.879
bits of pottery
found at a depth of 190 feet;

05:11.912 --> 05:15.349
a piece of parchment,
along with what appears to be

05:15.383 --> 05:17.818
a small sample of book-binding;

05:17.851 --> 05:20.588
and two fragments
of human bone:

05:20.621 --> 05:23.391
one whose ancestors
are European,

05:23.424 --> 05:26.059
and another that traces back
to the Middle East.

05:28.496 --> 05:30.998
But although the Laginas and
their partners on Oak Island

05:31.031 --> 05:33.601
believe they are closer
than ever to finding

05:33.634 --> 05:35.736
the original Money Pit,

05:35.769 --> 05:38.639
they still don't know the
nature of what they may find,

05:38.672 --> 05:40.641
or who put it there.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.713
RICK: As pertaining to
Rochefoucauld Castle,

05:45.746 --> 05:49.016
I mean we very much look forward
to going there,

05:49.049 --> 05:52.420
but I think if you could fill us
in on what we might expect,

05:52.453 --> 05:53.987
where your research has lead us,

05:54.021 --> 05:56.590
-I think that's where
we should start. -Yeah.

05:56.624 --> 06:01.061
The castle itself,
it's absolutely ancient.

06:01.094 --> 06:02.896
There are these chambers
under the castle--

06:02.930 --> 06:05.799
big chambers and tunnels
and stuff

06:05.833 --> 06:07.635
with carvings and things
like that.

06:07.668 --> 06:10.504
I think these two would love
to be down there,

06:10.538 --> 06:13.140
-as would I.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.443
RICK: Surely, I'm thinking,
there's something down there.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.177
Carvings give you information.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.713
Carvings are like a date
on a coin, if you will.

06:19.747 --> 06:22.450
It's credible evidence

06:22.483 --> 06:26.554
carved into a rock
that lasts centuries.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.122
One of the most exciting things

06:29.156 --> 06:31.158
would be a more solid connection

06:31.191 --> 06:34.161
between the Templars
and Oak Island.

06:34.194 --> 06:39.066
So, I think I did find
a connection.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.602
So, that's the HO stone there

06:41.635 --> 06:44.705
and the carvings.

06:44.738 --> 06:49.477
NARRATOR: In 1921, treasure
hunters working on Oak Island's

06:49.510 --> 06:52.179
northern shore discovered
a large boulder

06:52.212 --> 06:55.683
covered in mysterious carvings
and inscriptions.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.551
Believing it to be
an indication

06:57.585 --> 06:59.520
that treasure might lie
below it,

06:59.553 --> 07:01.555
they blew it up with dynamite

07:01.589 --> 07:03.791
so that they could dig
beneath it.

07:03.824 --> 07:08.095
Unfortunately, nothing was ever
found underneath the stone,

07:08.128 --> 07:10.831
and most of the carvings
that were etched on its surface

07:10.864 --> 07:12.766
were lost forever.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.135
Most, that is,
except for the one

07:15.168 --> 07:18.672
generally referred to
as the "HO Stone."

07:20.641 --> 07:24.878
I found two Templar chapels
in the Charente--

07:24.912 --> 07:26.246
in the area where we are going,

07:26.279 --> 07:30.017
and one has wall paintings.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.885
It's a fantastic painting.

07:31.919 --> 07:34.788
And this is a Templar
going off to fight.

07:34.822 --> 07:37.024
But on his shield
he's got this cross,

07:37.057 --> 07:39.993
which is exactly like
the HO Stone,

07:40.027 --> 07:42.963
with the cross in the middle,
and dots around the cross.

07:42.996 --> 07:45.899
-RICK: Oh, yes, very similar.
-ALEX: Absolutely.

07:45.933 --> 07:48.068
NARRATOR:
Templar crosses?

07:48.101 --> 07:51.605
Looking almost exactly like
the HO Stone?

07:51.639 --> 07:55.609
Could these depictions,
found in 12th and 13th-century

07:55.643 --> 07:58.779
Templar churches,
really be related to the one

07:58.812 --> 08:01.114
found on Oak Island?

08:01.148 --> 08:06.687
Now, a circle with a dot in it
can mean eternity,

08:06.720 --> 08:08.689
but I wondered
if it could represent

08:08.722 --> 08:10.758
the ancient Greek "O,"

08:10.791 --> 08:12.860
and with the little dash
in the middle,

08:12.893 --> 08:14.795
which is "theta."

08:14.828 --> 08:17.831
And that's the first letter
of "Theos," meaning God.

08:17.865 --> 08:19.633
It's a Christogram, in fact.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.004
NARRATOR: Dating back
to the fourth century,

08:24.037 --> 08:26.940
a Christogram is an
abbreviation or symbol

08:26.974 --> 08:29.843
for Jesus Christ,
and was commonly used

08:29.877 --> 08:32.780
in the Byzantine
and Medieval eras.

08:32.813 --> 08:35.616
One of the oldest types is
the Chi-Rho cross,

08:35.649 --> 08:39.720
which was later adopted
by the Knights Templar.

08:39.753 --> 08:42.590
It is Nichola's belief
that the HO Stone

08:42.623 --> 08:44.157
was written in Greek,

08:44.191 --> 08:46.259
with the "H" being the symbol
for "Eta,"

08:46.293 --> 08:49.797
and the "O"
representing "Theos."

08:49.830 --> 08:52.132
Could it be possible
that the symbols

08:52.165 --> 08:54.835
on the Oak Island's
mysterious HO Stone

08:54.868 --> 08:58.606
were carved centuries ago by
members of the Knights Templar?

09:01.041 --> 09:05.613
You're indicating this is an
ancient Greek representation.

09:05.646 --> 09:09.650
This is not somebody who
wandered over to Oak Island

09:09.683 --> 09:13.821
and for... on a lark, carved
these shapes into the rock.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.222
You would have to know
what you're doing.

09:15.255 --> 09:19.893
Yeah. It's actually quite
uncanny, really.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.195
I think we are going to find
some very interesting

09:22.229 --> 09:24.231
bits of information.
And for me,

09:24.264 --> 09:26.266
this has always been
and it will continue to be

09:26.299 --> 09:27.801
an information hunt,

09:27.835 --> 09:29.637
every bit as much
as a treasure hunt.

09:29.670 --> 09:31.972
I want some answers.
I think we all do.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.174
-Yeah.
-Let's make that happen.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.684
NARRATOR: As efforts to reach
target depth

09:43.717 --> 09:45.218
continue at the Money Pit
drill site...

09:45.252 --> 09:47.354
-Hey, Laird.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.022
-Welcome back.
-Thank you.

09:49.056 --> 09:50.791
Beautiful day to find something

09:50.824 --> 09:54.762
-unique and powerful
and astounding. -Absolutely.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.631
NARRATOR: Marty Lagina, along
with Oak Island team members

09:57.665 --> 09:59.933
Dave Blankenship
and Gary Drayton,

09:59.967 --> 10:03.336
have invited local archeologist
Laird Niven

10:03.370 --> 10:05.673
to continue with their
recent investigation

10:05.706 --> 10:09.309
of a strange stone foundation
on Lot 24,

10:09.342 --> 10:11.979
one of several lots once owned

10:12.012 --> 10:15.415
by former American slave
Samuel Ball.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.251
So, what we thought is we'd head
back to the site over here

10:18.285 --> 10:20.020
and take direction from you

10:20.053 --> 10:23.824
-as, you know, how to
archeologically proceed. -Okay.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.225
-Well, let's go do it.
-All right. -Dig it.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.294
And dig it, yeah.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.997
-The dirt isn't gonna move
itself, is it? -That's right.

10:30.030 --> 10:34.367
NARRATOR: Because Samuel Ball is
considered one of Nova Scotia's

10:34.401 --> 10:37.004
most culturally significant
historical figures,

10:37.037 --> 10:40.674
the team was discouraged
from digging on the site

10:40.708 --> 10:43.076
until Rick and Marty could
first obtain the proper permits

10:43.110 --> 10:45.345
from Nova Scotia's Department

10:45.378 --> 10:48.248
of Communities,
Culture and Heritage.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.683
That's it.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.318
GARY:
What the heck is that?

10:51.351 --> 10:52.419
I think we have to stop.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.926
MARTY: All right, Laird,
we're ready to be coached.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.995
-Okay. -This will be
my first archeological dig.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.897
-Kind of excited about it.
-Me, too.

11:03.931 --> 11:06.466
-Just the very beginnings
of one. -Yeah. -Yeah.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.903
NARRATOR: As Marty and his team
on Oak Island begin

11:09.937 --> 11:14.074
their archaeological
examination on Lot 24...

11:14.107 --> 11:16.877
Rick Lagina--
along with his nephews,

11:16.910 --> 11:19.412
Alex Lagina
and Peter Fornetti--

11:19.446 --> 11:21.749
have arrived
at Rochefoucauld Castle

11:21.782 --> 11:24.484
with researcher Nichola Lewis.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.386
They are hoping
to find evidence

11:26.419 --> 11:28.956
linking
the Rochefoucauld family

11:28.989 --> 11:32.392
with the mysterious map which
was given to Rick one year ago

11:32.425 --> 11:34.494
by researcher Zena Halpern.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.496
Do come in.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.198
-Welcome to my home.
-Madame Matossian.

11:38.231 --> 11:41.301
Representing the 42nd
of 43 generations

11:41.334 --> 11:44.004
of the Rochefoucauld family,

11:44.037 --> 11:46.039
Sonia Matossian serves
as the curator

11:46.073 --> 11:49.777
of Château de la Rochefoucauld,
and is also an authority

11:49.810 --> 11:52.780
on her family's
ancient history.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.447
Thank you for coming.
And I'm sure

11:54.481 --> 11:56.116
that you'll appreciate the home,

11:56.149 --> 11:58.151
because it really is
very remarkable.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.419
And what else
is very, very interesting,

11:59.452 --> 12:00.888
you'll go all the way down

12:00.921 --> 12:03.090
underneath the castle.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.424
It's built on a rock.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.426
That's where
our name comes from--

12:06.459 --> 12:08.796
Foucauld's Rock,
La Roche Foucauld.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.798
And you'll find
that you can walk

12:10.831 --> 12:12.465
underneath the whole castle.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.868
It hasn't got any foundations.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.137
It's just sitting on the rock.

12:19.339 --> 12:22.342
Château de La Rochefoucauld

12:22.375 --> 12:24.511
began as a large
wooden fortification

12:24.544 --> 12:27.014
built in the year 980

12:27.047 --> 12:28.949
as a means of protecting
its inhabitants

12:28.982 --> 12:31.151
from Viking invaders.

12:31.184 --> 12:35.322
Over the next 500 years, it
would continue to grow in size,

12:35.355 --> 12:37.357
and is now considered one

12:37.390 --> 12:41.061
of the greatest achievements
of the French Renaissance.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.830
RICK:
You're standing on ground

12:42.863 --> 12:44.564
that people
have been walking on

12:44.597 --> 12:45.866
for a thousand years.

12:45.899 --> 12:47.000
As we're walking in,

12:47.034 --> 12:48.836
I'm thinking, boy,

12:48.869 --> 12:52.105
who has set foot
on this ground before me?

12:52.139 --> 12:55.475
Kings, queens,
perhaps Knights Templar.

12:55.508 --> 12:58.011
If stone could talk,
I could sit there for eons

12:58.045 --> 12:59.412
listening to the stories.

12:59.446 --> 13:03.250
Initially,
we came here because of a map,

13:03.283 --> 13:06.153
a map that surfaced
in the 1970s,

13:06.186 --> 13:09.189
and there was a reference
to your family name.

13:09.222 --> 13:12.292
And I have a copy.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.494
You will see the reference

13:14.527 --> 13:16.463
to your family's name at the top

13:16.496 --> 13:19.299
of the page.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.869
We think there might be
some sort of connection.

13:21.902 --> 13:24.471
Well, there obviously is
a connection.

13:24.504 --> 13:28.141
There obviously is-- well,
there can't... it can't not be.

13:28.175 --> 13:30.978
Because otherwise the name
wouldn't be on the paper.

13:31.011 --> 13:33.914
RICK: It begs the question
from us that...

13:33.947 --> 13:38.185
within the Rochefoucauld family,
are there Templar connections?

13:38.218 --> 13:39.853
I've never heard of Templars
in the family.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.154
Doesn't mean
that there weren't any.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.289
I've never heard of them.

13:42.322 --> 13:45.258
I have heard of the Crusades.

13:45.292 --> 13:48.095
They all went to the Crusades.

13:48.128 --> 13:50.263
So one can imagine
that they had met each other

13:50.297 --> 13:53.266
and that they knew who was what,

13:53.300 --> 13:56.036
because of, obviously,
the reason for the Templars

13:56.069 --> 13:57.604
was the Crusades.

13:57.637 --> 14:01.574
But the Templars were
more military,

14:01.608 --> 14:05.012
and the family was
more religious.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.047
But it doesn't mean that
they didn't meet each other.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.249
Yes.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.418
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

14:11.451 --> 14:15.322
that the Knights Templar knew
and fought alongside members

14:15.355 --> 14:19.192
of the Rochefoucauld family
during the Crusades?

14:19.226 --> 14:23.263
If so, could the Templars
have trusted this family enough

14:23.296 --> 14:27.034
to reveal to them the location
of a vast collection

14:27.067 --> 14:30.938
of valuable religious artifacts
rescued from the Holy Land,

14:30.971 --> 14:34.407
and then, perhaps,
hidden far below the surface

14:34.441 --> 14:36.409
of Oak Island?

14:36.443 --> 14:39.312
RICK:
This family is a dynasty.

14:39.346 --> 14:42.682
It's extremely powerful,
extremely influential,

14:42.715 --> 14:44.684
and there's no way

14:44.717 --> 14:46.486
that the family did not have

14:46.519 --> 14:50.123
some sort of connection
with the Templars.

14:50.157 --> 14:52.325
Might that interaction
have carried back

14:52.359 --> 14:54.394
once they came back
from the Crusades?

14:54.427 --> 14:56.263
I should think, yes.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.398
So, this writing, then.

14:58.431 --> 15:01.501
I'm just wondering what you
thought of the actual writing.

15:01.534 --> 15:04.204
RICK: Is that translation
accurately presented there,

15:04.237 --> 15:07.174
in your opinion?

15:07.207 --> 15:10.043
SONIA: He would have
written it in slang.

15:10.077 --> 15:13.013
If he hadn't been educated,
he would've written it in slang,

15:13.046 --> 15:15.715
in his slang,
which comes from his country.

15:15.748 --> 15:19.252
Here there's a certain slang;
ten miles away, it's different.

15:19.286 --> 15:23.991
RICK: So you think the verbiage
on there is slang?

15:24.024 --> 15:26.226
The important people,
the people... the nobility...

15:26.259 --> 15:29.329
-Mm-hmm. -...knew how
to speak French perfectly.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.298
So it means he knows
what he's talking about,

15:31.331 --> 15:33.400
but he can't write it.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.236
It is Sonia's assessment
that the writing

15:36.269 --> 15:39.172
on Zena Halpern's map
is in slang--

15:39.206 --> 15:42.675
or what is commonly referred to
as "Old French"--

15:42.709 --> 15:47.314
which was widely spoken between
the 8th and 14th centuries.

15:47.347 --> 15:49.316
This could mean
that if the translator

15:49.349 --> 15:51.318
only knew modern French,

15:51.351 --> 15:53.620
some of the English
translations on the map

15:53.653 --> 15:56.423
may be incorrect.

15:56.456 --> 16:00.027
Can you look
at this language on the map?

16:00.060 --> 16:02.495
This is our understanding of it.

16:02.529 --> 16:06.699
Is this correct in your
understanding of that verbiage?

16:06.733 --> 16:09.736
Francois de la Ro...
Francois de la Rochefoucauld.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.604
A little drink?

16:11.638 --> 16:14.341
(Nichola and Sonia
speaking French)

16:18.545 --> 16:20.380
Means "towards."

16:22.049 --> 16:23.750
-It doesn't mean a drink.

16:23.783 --> 16:26.353
What's that?
-Towards. -Towards.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.588
(Nichola and Sonia
speaking French)

16:33.060 --> 16:34.594
What... so, what does it say?

16:34.627 --> 16:36.596
SONIA:
It's nothing to do with drink.

16:36.629 --> 16:38.298
-Towards the west.
-Towards the west.

16:43.470 --> 16:45.805
-SONIA: So, it says,

16:45.838 --> 16:48.641
-"Towards the west."
-"Towards the west."

16:48.675 --> 16:51.244
NARRATOR:
While searching for new leads

16:51.278 --> 16:52.812
at the Rochefoucauld Castle

16:52.845 --> 16:55.215
in Charente, France,
Rick Lagina

16:55.248 --> 16:58.218
has just been informed
that the English translation

16:58.251 --> 17:01.321
on the map given to him
by researcher Zena Halpern

17:01.354 --> 17:03.490
is most likely incorrect.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.692
Instead of reading:
"This drawing

17:05.725 --> 17:07.794
"for Monsieur
Francois Rochefoucauld,

17:07.827 --> 17:09.796
a little drink from Neustria,"

17:09.829 --> 17:13.433
it states something
significantly different.

17:13.466 --> 17:18.071
So, it says, "This sketch
for Mr. La Rochefoucauld.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.472
"A little towards...

17:19.506 --> 17:22.575
a little towards
the-the-the west."

17:22.609 --> 17:25.078
Does this new translation
offer proof

17:25.112 --> 17:27.747
that the source
of Zena Halpern's map

17:27.780 --> 17:31.484
was not only very old,
but was quite possibly the work

17:31.518 --> 17:34.354
of someone associated
with the Knights Templar?

17:34.387 --> 17:36.289
And, if so,

17:36.323 --> 17:38.691
does this validate
the legends and theories

17:38.725 --> 17:41.728
that insist the Knights Templar
came to Oak Island

17:41.761 --> 17:44.097
sometime in the 14th century

17:44.131 --> 17:47.234
and hid
an incredible treasure there?

17:47.267 --> 17:49.736
This takes the information hunt
to another level.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.504
There's no question about that.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.840
We're actually engaged
in the process.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.776
Zena's map and her research,
I find incredible.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.678
I want to prove
that it's authentic,

17:58.711 --> 18:00.580
and to that end,

18:00.613 --> 18:03.550
I think we've made
some strides here, uh, but...

18:03.583 --> 18:05.385
I don't know
that we're there yet.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.354
I'm going to give you the keys,

18:07.387 --> 18:09.656
and you're going to go all
the way down to Foucauld's Rock.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.458
-I'm not going to go with you.
-Mm-hmm.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.426
I'll be waiting
with a cup of tea,

18:13.460 --> 18:14.794
which is much more agreeable

18:14.827 --> 18:16.496
than going down
to Foucauld's Rock.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.531
You go down,
and I'll wait for you next door.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.400
-We will be back.
-Thank you very much.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.535
NARRATOR:
As Rick, Alex and Peter

18:22.569 --> 18:25.272
make their way
to Foucauld's Rock,

18:25.305 --> 18:28.475
back on Oak Island,
Rick's brother, Marty,

18:28.508 --> 18:30.577
continues his exploration

18:30.610 --> 18:33.180
of the mysterious area
recently discovered on property

18:33.213 --> 18:37.484
once owned by the former
American slave, Samuel Ball.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.486
All right,
so here's the feature we found.

18:39.519 --> 18:42.422
-Right. -There's a concentration
of stones, fairly deep.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.591
That's what we're gonna reveal.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.626
We're gonna err
on the side of caution

18:46.659 --> 18:48.861
and take our time
and excavate down.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.931
So remove the loose soil,
screen it,

18:51.964 --> 18:55.502
-until we get what we hope is
an intact feature. -Okay.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.704
While Laird carefully brushes
dirt and debris

18:57.737 --> 18:59.739
away from the stones,

18:59.772 --> 19:02.309
Marty and Gary
will set up a screen sifter

19:02.342 --> 19:05.312
to search through the spoils.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.714
So, we're just trying to
establish some solid walls here.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.549
MARTY:
Just trying to define the dig.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.618
LAIRD:
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.723
MARTY: What do you think
you're unearthing here?

19:16.756 --> 19:18.825
-Well...

19:18.858 --> 19:21.494
Well, there was
a gravel level that we hit.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.863
And now below that,
we're finding... rocks.

19:23.896 --> 19:26.233
It doesn't look natural to me.

19:26.266 --> 19:30.437
It looks deposited
by people, to me.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.439
I would think maybe a floor.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.507
NARRATOR:
A floor?

19:34.541 --> 19:38.311
On property once belonging
to Samuel Ball?

19:38.345 --> 19:43.516
In 1762, Oak Island
was divided into 32 lots,

19:43.550 --> 19:46.619
each comprised
of four acres of land.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.755
Because there was no causeway,

19:48.788 --> 19:51.858
and the only way to reach
the island was by boat,

19:51.891 --> 19:54.861
the land was not generally
thought of as a place to live,

19:54.894 --> 19:57.530
but as a place to farm.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.799
The absence
of natural predators

19:59.832 --> 20:03.236
also made it an ideal place
to keep livestock.

20:03.270 --> 20:05.238
Even to this day,

20:05.272 --> 20:08.375
there are only three habitable
structures on the island,

20:08.408 --> 20:11.644
so the finding of a foundation
on Samuel Ball's property

20:11.678 --> 20:13.713
is highly unusual.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.284
I don't see any metal, do you?

20:21.554 --> 20:23.690
Oh.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.726
Look--
a little piece of pottery.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.561
-LAIRD: Oh, excellent.
-GARY: It's just a small piece.

20:28.595 --> 20:31.531
You're not getting a lot
of information off this, but...

20:31.564 --> 20:33.366
This might be early--
it looks like, uh,

20:33.400 --> 20:35.368
what we call
Staffordshire slipware.

20:35.402 --> 20:37.770
GARY:
When you say this is early,

20:37.804 --> 20:39.606
what kind of time frame here?

20:39.639 --> 20:42.542
So, say mid-18th century to...

20:42.575 --> 20:44.511
to, like, 1770s.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.015
-MARTY: What tells you
that that's old? -The body...

20:49.048 --> 20:50.883
and the glaze.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.419
That's the earliest stuff
we've found so far.

20:52.452 --> 20:53.686
GARY:
Yeah, that's great.

20:53.720 --> 20:54.954
MARTY:
I was impressed, honestly.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.456
I mean, I was
kind of rolling my eyes

20:56.489 --> 20:57.890
a little bit
when he gets down there

20:57.924 --> 20:59.526
with that trowel and,
you know, makes us sift

20:59.559 --> 21:01.994
all that dirt, but, you know,

21:02.028 --> 21:03.930
by gosh, here comes
a piece of pottery--

21:03.963 --> 21:05.798
there's just no way
we would've found it otherwise.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.033
You can't metal-detect pottery.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.568
What he's doing is working.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.470
This is the layer

21:10.503 --> 21:12.605
-where the ceramics
are coming from. -Yeah.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.741
And that's sitting on top
of those large rocks.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.677
-MARTY: Yeah.

21:17.710 --> 21:18.811
LAIRD: That's unusual.
That's not glacial.

21:18.845 --> 21:20.313
MARTY:
You know what's amazing?

21:20.347 --> 21:21.381
The little bit of clearing
we did here,

21:21.414 --> 21:23.316
look how pretty this lot is.

21:23.350 --> 21:25.452
-Yeah. -MARTY: Explains why it
would be a nice homesite,

21:25.485 --> 21:28.555
or encampment or staging area.

21:28.588 --> 21:31.358
-And look at the command of the
mainland right up there. -Yeah.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.959
-Yeah. -GARY: Maybe just
a crossing point,

21:32.992 --> 21:34.661
where people came across here.

21:34.694 --> 21:36.529
MARTY: That's what I mean,
if somebody's

21:36.563 --> 21:38.831
-trying to get here, and you
needed to know about it, -Yeah.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.767
this would be the place to be.

21:40.800 --> 21:44.070
NARRATOR: Given that
the foundation on Lot 24

21:44.103 --> 21:46.673
is n large enough to have
once been part of a house

21:46.706 --> 21:48.074
or a dwelling...

21:48.107 --> 21:49.742
Is it possible it was part

21:49.776 --> 21:51.978
of some other,
less permanent structure,

21:52.011 --> 21:54.013
like a lookout post?

21:54.046 --> 21:55.982
One where someone on the island

21:56.015 --> 21:57.684
could keep a watchful eye

21:57.717 --> 22:00.553
on anyone approaching
from the ocean?

22:00.587 --> 22:02.955
If so, could it have been
built by someone

22:02.989 --> 22:05.525
who kept watch
over the Money Pit site?

22:05.558 --> 22:09.028
Or someone who helped dig it?

22:09.061 --> 22:12.799
For that answer, many more
hours will be needed,

22:12.832 --> 22:16.369
and many more artifacts
will need to be uncovered.

22:16.403 --> 22:18.838
-Well, we're doing it right,
I'm proud of that. -Yep.

22:18.871 --> 22:21.874
NARRATOR: As Marty Lagina and
the Oak Island team

22:21.908 --> 22:25.578
continue to search
for clues on Lot 24...

22:25.612 --> 22:28.147
Rick Lagina,
along with his nephews

22:28.180 --> 22:30.016
and researcher
Nichola Lewis,

22:30.049 --> 22:32.785
begin their exploration
of the caves

22:32.819 --> 22:36.055
located beneath Rochefoucauld
Castle in France.

22:36.088 --> 22:38.491
Rick is hoping to find carvings

22:38.525 --> 22:41.160
or other physical evidence
linking the Rochefoucauld

22:41.193 --> 22:45.832
family to the Knights Templar,
and possibly Oak Island.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.868
-So, this must be...
-Foucauld's Rock.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.804
Yeah. We're inside of it.

22:51.838 --> 22:54.040
NARRATOR:
Foucauld's Rock is the name

22:54.073 --> 22:56.075
of the natural stone foundation

22:56.108 --> 22:58.778
that the entire
castle rests upon.

22:58.811 --> 23:01.681
It gets its name from Fucaldus,

23:01.714 --> 23:04.150
the first person to build
a structure on this site

23:04.183 --> 23:06.553
in the year 980 AD,

23:06.586 --> 23:08.921
more than 1,000 years ago.

23:11.057 --> 23:12.459
Oh, this is, this is...

23:12.492 --> 23:14.661
the bottom.

23:14.694 --> 23:15.928
NICHOLA:
Kind of eerie, isn't it?

23:15.962 --> 23:17.564
RICK:
This is, this is, this what

23:17.597 --> 23:18.831
the castle was built out of.

23:18.865 --> 23:21.067
-Yeah. -Yes.
-This rock, limestone.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.102
RICK:
I mean, literally, the castle

23:23.135 --> 23:25.438
rises from that stone,
that rock.

23:25.472 --> 23:27.740
And their family name
comes from that...

23:27.774 --> 23:29.609
on the rock.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.811
And, you know, you're standing
on the very rock

23:31.844 --> 23:35.014
that her ancestors defended.

23:35.047 --> 23:37.149
So it was a little piece
of history.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.685
You know, you reach out
and touch it.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.887
I'm not seeing any.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.221
-PETER: No carvings.
-No.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.056
PETER:
Keeps going.

23:45.558 --> 23:47.059
ALEX:
No.

23:47.093 --> 23:49.496
-We didn't find
any carvings, so... -RICK: No.

23:49.529 --> 23:51.230
For something this old,
I find it quite strange

23:51.263 --> 23:52.499
that there's nothing.

23:52.532 --> 23:53.533
Well, you would think that

23:53.566 --> 23:56.002
this is a perfect place.

23:56.035 --> 23:58.938
You know, perhaps
with supplies down here,

23:58.971 --> 24:00.673
people are gonna be down here.

24:00.707 --> 24:02.542
Bottom line is, I'm mystified

24:02.575 --> 24:04.544
there's no carvings down here.

24:04.577 --> 24:05.878
Okay, should we head up?

24:05.912 --> 24:06.846
-RICK: Yeah.
-ALEX: Okay.

24:08.681 --> 24:11.751
So, how did you like

24:11.784 --> 24:14.120
the famous Foucauld's Rock?

24:14.153 --> 24:16.155
-It was impressive.
-It's amazing to think that he

24:16.188 --> 24:19.859
-built his camp on the rock
in 980. -Mm-hmm.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.528
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

24:21.561 --> 24:23.696
There's one thing,
uh, that we noticed.

24:23.730 --> 24:26.265
We were looking for carvings in
the caves and we didn't see any.

24:26.298 --> 24:28.067
You know why?

24:28.100 --> 24:30.837
-No, I don't.
-Because in the 18th century,

24:30.870 --> 24:33.640
the people that lived in
the town used to tan leather.

24:33.673 --> 24:36.876
And to be able to tan leather,

24:36.909 --> 24:39.812
they moved the bed of the river.

24:39.846 --> 24:43.215
-and made it go
under the castle. -Oh.

24:43.249 --> 24:44.551
And it's probably
washed everything off.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.222
Per our quest,

24:50.256 --> 24:52.158
you've been immensely helpful
and we're very,

24:52.191 --> 24:53.760
very appreciative.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.061
We hope that the information

24:55.094 --> 24:56.896
you've-you've been kind enough

24:56.929 --> 24:59.999
to give us will help us
in our discovery.

25:00.032 --> 25:01.734
-We appreciate everything.
-Thank you for coming.

25:01.768 --> 25:02.735
-Thank you.
-Thank you for coming, dear.

25:09.108 --> 25:12.111
NARRATOR: The next day, Rick
Lagina, along with his nephews,

25:12.144 --> 25:15.615
Alex Lagina
and Peter Fornetti,

25:15.648 --> 25:19.018
travel to the village
of Domme, France.

25:19.051 --> 25:22.121
I'm Rick. -Hello, Rick.

25:22.154 --> 25:23.923
NARRATOR:
They have arranged to meet

25:23.956 --> 25:24.957
with Templar expert
Jerry Glover,

25:24.991 --> 25:27.694
in hopes of finding carvings

25:27.727 --> 25:30.663
or other physical evidence
linking Oak Island

25:30.697 --> 25:34.934
with various theories
concerning the Knights Templar.

25:34.967 --> 25:38.104
Jerry has offered to get Rick
and his nephews access

25:38.137 --> 25:42.975
to a 14th-century French
fortress known as Domme Prison.

25:43.009 --> 25:46.813
This is the guardhouse where
the Templars were imprisoned.

25:46.846 --> 25:49.916
NARRATOR:
The fortified stronghold known

25:49.949 --> 25:51.684
as Domme Prison was
founded in 1281

25:51.718 --> 25:55.655
by King Philip III of France.

25:55.688 --> 25:58.725
After the king's
sudden death in 1285,

25:58.758 --> 26:02.328
his son, Philip IV,
took the crown

26:02.361 --> 26:06.298
and soon fell into substantial
debt to the Knights Templar,

26:06.332 --> 26:10.336
who were, by then, a very
powerful group of warrior monks

26:10.369 --> 26:12.939
who had amassed
a substantial fortune

26:12.972 --> 26:15.041
while serving
as the paid bodyguards

26:15.074 --> 26:18.711
for Christian pilgrims
visiting the Holy Land.

26:21.180 --> 26:22.949
We were trying
to connect the Templars

26:22.982 --> 26:24.651
with Oak Island.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.318
Well, you've come
to the right place,

26:26.352 --> 26:29.656
because it's always
been assumed that

26:29.689 --> 26:31.357
there are no original
Templar writings

26:31.390 --> 26:34.661
or artworks; their archive
in Paris was destroyed.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.128
But, it happens,

26:36.162 --> 26:39.999
that here at the, uh,
guardhouse in Domme,

26:40.032 --> 26:42.301
they did leave, uh,
lots of traces

26:42.334 --> 26:46.806
of, uh, thoughts and,
uh, sacred ideas

26:46.839 --> 26:49.942
in the form of graffiti
on the walls here.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.277
Great, can we take a look?

26:51.310 --> 26:54.380
Absolutely, let's have a look.

26:54.413 --> 26:57.016
RICK: The Templars
were imprisoned here.

26:57.049 --> 26:58.384
They were not going to escape.

26:58.417 --> 27:01.353
Their lives were to end here.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.189
And the three of us
are quite excited to see

27:03.222 --> 27:05.324
what type of carvings
and can they be

27:05.357 --> 27:07.660
associated with Oak Island?

27:09.228 --> 27:10.196
JERRY:
Come in.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.033
Wow.

27:21.273 --> 27:23.676
RICK:
It's an incredible structure.

27:30.717 --> 27:33.019
So, were they housed here
for seven years?

27:33.052 --> 27:35.121
Yes, they were, yes.

27:35.154 --> 27:38.791
NARRATOR:
On Friday 13, 1307,

27:38.825 --> 27:42.762
King Philip IV ordered that
the Templars be rounded up

27:42.795 --> 27:46.165
and arrested
on charges of heresy.

27:46.198 --> 27:49.135
The captured Templars
were brought to Domme

27:49.168 --> 27:50.369
where they were imprisoned...

27:50.402 --> 27:52.104
tortured...

27:52.138 --> 27:53.906
and later executed.

27:56.743 --> 28:00.079
And you can see lots of evidence
of how they passed their time,

28:00.112 --> 28:02.381
which was by making carvings

28:02.414 --> 28:05.718
in the walls
to sustain them, spiritually.

28:05.752 --> 28:07.419
How would they have carved this?

28:07.453 --> 28:09.889
They surely would not
have had implements?

28:09.922 --> 28:11.791
It's said that,

28:11.824 --> 28:14.894
because their weapons
would've been removed from them

28:14.927 --> 28:18.430
when they were imprisoned,
they would've

28:18.464 --> 28:21.233
had to have maybe
used their teeth,

28:21.267 --> 28:23.235
or their fingernails.

28:23.269 --> 28:27.439
This one has clearly been
worked on over many hours,

28:27.473 --> 28:31.177
possibly by more
than one person.

28:31.210 --> 28:34.446
Over here is some of the most
well-known carvings at Domme.

28:34.480 --> 28:35.414
This way.

28:39.919 --> 28:44.891
Deep carvings of the Virgin Mary
with, uh, the child Jesus.

28:44.924 --> 28:46.258
Rather ordinary crosses.

28:50.296 --> 28:53.900
Are these crosses with the...

28:53.933 --> 28:58.170
What shall we call them?
Triangles on the end?

28:58.204 --> 29:02.141
Is this solely
a Templar construct?

29:02.174 --> 29:07.013
Because this is what we've come
to call a Templar cross,

29:07.046 --> 29:09.115
but what is its origination?

29:09.148 --> 29:11.784
I mean, is it
exclusively Templar?

29:11.818 --> 29:14.420
It isn't exclusively Templar,

29:14.453 --> 29:18.390
though it is closely associated

29:18.424 --> 29:20.960
with the Crusading orders.

29:20.993 --> 29:22.461
Still Crusaders,

29:22.494 --> 29:24.763
but not-not exclusively Templar.

29:26.298 --> 29:30.202
This one here, which is
one termed "The Grail."

29:30.236 --> 29:33.139
It's a symmetric,
geometric design.

29:33.172 --> 29:35.341
There seems to be the form,

29:35.374 --> 29:39.211
possibly, of a chalice
in this section,

29:39.245 --> 29:43.082
and the octagonal shape
on the top,

29:43.115 --> 29:47.253
with a-a branching
form inside it.

29:47.286 --> 29:51.557
There's something that I see in
it, and it may mean nothing.

29:51.590 --> 29:53.125
What do you two see?

29:53.159 --> 29:57.063
If you turn this around,
what is that?

29:58.898 --> 30:00.399
Well...

30:00.432 --> 30:02.134
It's reminiscent of the
Rochefoucauld family

30:02.168 --> 30:04.003
-coat of arms.
-RICK: Exactly.

30:04.036 --> 30:08.007
NARRATOR: The Rochefoucauld
family coat of arms?

30:08.040 --> 30:11.310
Represented in a carving
of the Holy Grail?

30:11.343 --> 30:13.545
Could this be evidence
of the close bond

30:13.579 --> 30:16.482
that existed between
the Rochefoucauld family

30:16.515 --> 30:18.951
and the Knights Templar?

30:18.985 --> 30:22.855
Also, the special Domme cross,

30:22.889 --> 30:25.624
with, uh, multiple arms

30:25.657 --> 30:30.529
reflected, uh, horizontally,
and, uh,

30:30.562 --> 30:35.434
splaying into branching forms,
most plant-like.

30:35.467 --> 30:38.570
-Have you seen examples
of that before? -No.

30:38.604 --> 30:42.108
These don't exist anywhere else.
They only exist here.

30:42.141 --> 30:43.943
It's so unusual.

30:43.976 --> 30:46.045
You have to think
of what other sources

30:46.078 --> 30:48.314
of inspiration there
could have been for this.

30:48.347 --> 30:50.582
And I think it's possible,

30:50.616 --> 30:53.319
given their contacts
in the Holy Land,

30:53.352 --> 30:55.554
that this might have
been inspired by

30:55.587 --> 30:57.456
the Kabbalistic Tree of Life.

31:02.294 --> 31:04.430
NARRATOR: At a 14th-century
Templar prison

31:04.463 --> 31:06.065
in Domme, France...

31:06.098 --> 31:08.500
Rick Lagina, along
with his nephews

31:08.534 --> 31:12.271
Alex Lagina and Peter Fornetti,
have just been shown

31:12.304 --> 31:15.908
an ancient Templar carving
of what appears to be

31:15.942 --> 31:19.511
the ancient Hebraic symbol
known as the Tree of Life.

31:19.545 --> 31:20.612
ALEX:
We've seen that before.

31:20.646 --> 31:22.148
Well, we've-we've heard theories

31:22.181 --> 31:24.350
about that before.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.185
NARRATOR:
It is widely believed

31:26.218 --> 31:28.220
that the Knights Templar
were in the Middle East

31:28.254 --> 31:32.358
not only to protect Christian
pilgrims during the Crusades,

31:32.391 --> 31:35.061
but to search for and secure

31:35.094 --> 31:37.997
sacred religious objects
and records.

31:38.030 --> 31:41.133
According to researchers,
the Templars,

31:41.167 --> 31:44.370
while in the Holy Land,
studied and adopted imagery

31:44.403 --> 31:47.206
from the Kabbalistic order
of Judaism,

31:47.239 --> 31:50.309
including that associated
with the "Tree of Life,"

31:50.342 --> 31:55.147
which defines God and creation
as an interconnected series

31:55.181 --> 31:58.550
of ten intellectual
and emotional attributes,

31:58.584 --> 32:00.987
otherwise known as sefirot.

32:01.020 --> 32:04.556
It is this same symbol
that many researchers believe

32:04.590 --> 32:07.026
can be found on Oak Island,

32:07.059 --> 32:10.196
in the form of a mysterious
collection of large boulders

32:10.229 --> 32:12.698
known as Nolan's Cross.

32:12.731 --> 32:15.334
Jerry referenced a carving,
which he thought

32:15.367 --> 32:18.237
was a Tree of Life design,

32:18.270 --> 32:21.340
and, for me,
I believe we have found

32:21.373 --> 32:24.743
some evidence on the island
that perhaps represents

32:24.776 --> 32:26.545
the Tree of Life.

32:26.578 --> 32:29.581
So there's
a direct connection there.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.984
NARRATOR:
But could this carving,

32:32.018 --> 32:34.720
found on the walls
of a 14th-century prison,

32:34.753 --> 32:38.090
also be connected
to Oak Island another way?

32:38.124 --> 32:41.693
Could it offer a clue
as to how a human bone,

32:41.727 --> 32:44.063
found to be
of Middle Eastern origin,

32:44.096 --> 32:46.698
was recently discovered
in Borehole H-8,

32:46.732 --> 32:50.169
some 160 feet deep
below ground?

32:50.202 --> 32:52.704
If this is the Tree of Life,

32:52.738 --> 32:55.774
then one could posit
that they're trying to relay

32:55.807 --> 32:57.743
some sort of information here.

32:57.776 --> 33:00.246
They know they're in trouble,
they're imprisoned,

33:00.279 --> 33:04.483
they know that the Templar
community is under siege

33:04.516 --> 33:06.652
by the pope and the king.

33:06.685 --> 33:10.189
Now, they obviously wanted
to keep that symbolism alive.

33:10.222 --> 33:11.623
I mean,
you're in dire straits here,

33:11.657 --> 33:13.725
you're not gonna record
something on these walls

33:13.759 --> 33:15.494
that doesn't associate
with your belief system.

33:15.527 --> 33:17.229
Absolutely.

33:17.263 --> 33:19.431
The Templars have nothing
to lose at this point,

33:19.465 --> 33:22.368
so what you have here

33:22.401 --> 33:26.672
is pure, unfettered thoughts.

33:26.705 --> 33:30.509
NARRATOR: It is widely believed
that the Templars,

33:30.542 --> 33:32.811
having no hope
of escape or survival,

33:32.844 --> 33:35.481
were convinced that their
beliefs and traditions

33:35.514 --> 33:37.416
would die with them.

33:37.449 --> 33:41.353
For this reason, they carved
symbols and effigies

33:41.387 --> 33:43.689
all over the walls
of Domme Prison,

33:43.722 --> 33:47.093
often using their own teeth
as tools.

33:47.126 --> 33:50.362
We'd like you to take
a look at that stone.

33:50.396 --> 33:53.299
The HO Stone,
which was found on Oak Island.

33:53.332 --> 33:56.302
This was part
of a much larger stone,

33:56.335 --> 33:58.670
with many carvings on it.

33:58.704 --> 34:00.772
Unfortunately, in the 1920s,

34:00.806 --> 34:03.109
this stone was blown up
by locals

34:03.142 --> 34:05.177
looking for treasure
underneath the stone.

34:05.211 --> 34:08.580
But these glyphs,
what do you make of them?

34:08.614 --> 34:10.149
It's certainly interesting

34:10.182 --> 34:12.818
that the cross at the center
with the pellets

34:12.851 --> 34:17.756
is indicative
of graffiti crosses carved

34:17.789 --> 34:20.326
by Crusading knights.

34:20.359 --> 34:24.396
You see similar ones here
in the guardhouse at Domme.

34:24.430 --> 34:27.399
Really

34:27.433 --> 34:29.635
There's some over here.

34:33.839 --> 34:35.374
Here's a good example.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.577
ALEX:
Oh, yeah.

34:39.878 --> 34:43.215
One, two, three, four.

34:43.249 --> 34:45.717
-Well... -You can see it
better on the top one.

34:45.751 --> 34:48.120
RICK:
Oh, yes. Yes.

34:48.154 --> 34:49.788
Isn't that a Templar cross?

34:51.590 --> 34:53.692
NARRATOR:
While numerous stone carvings,

34:53.725 --> 34:56.595
believed to have been left by
members of the Knights Templar,

34:56.628 --> 34:59.898
have been found
on and near Oak Island...

34:59.931 --> 35:01.533
On the face of the stone,

35:01.567 --> 35:04.436
you can see the cross
of the Knights Templar.

35:04.470 --> 35:07.706
...the carvings
at Domme Prison,

35:07.739 --> 35:10.376
which depict a cross
with four pellets,

35:10.409 --> 35:15.581
are nearly identical to those
found on the HO Stone.

35:15.614 --> 35:19.818
Based on what is referred to
as a Jerusalem crucifix,

35:19.851 --> 35:22.654
this so-called Templar cross
also features

35:22.688 --> 35:24.623
four smaller crosses,

35:24.656 --> 35:27.459
which are said to represent
the four evangelists,

35:27.493 --> 35:31.330
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

35:31.363 --> 35:34.533
Once the Knights Templar
adopted this symbol,

35:34.566 --> 35:37.369
they changed the images
of the four smaller crosses

35:37.403 --> 35:38.670
to four coins,

35:38.704 --> 35:40.506
which were meant to represent

35:40.539 --> 35:43.542
their established
banking system.

35:43.575 --> 35:46.878
RICK: The symbology
we're seeing on the walls,

35:46.912 --> 35:50.316
and the HO Stone--
very, very similar.

35:50.349 --> 35:52.784
I mean, they couldn't be
more similar.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.621
So, it's a direct connection,
but what does it mean?

35:55.654 --> 35:57.589
Does that mean
that Templars did both?

35:57.623 --> 35:58.690
I don't know.

35:58.724 --> 36:00.892
I mean, it's a clue.

36:00.926 --> 36:03.962
It-it surely opens the door
to possibilities.

36:03.995 --> 36:06.465
I just think that there's...

36:06.498 --> 36:08.500
there's more here
than I thought.

36:08.534 --> 36:09.901
-Yeah.
-I am surprised, I really am,

36:09.935 --> 36:11.870
that you've got
the Tree of Life,

36:11.903 --> 36:16.408
you've got the pellets on the
crosses that look similar,

36:16.442 --> 36:18.777
very similar, in my opinion,
to the HO Stone.

36:18.810 --> 36:21.447
I mean, it's what
we came for, really.

36:21.480 --> 36:26.718
We tried to connect, with some
clarity, some definition,

36:26.752 --> 36:30.456
the possibility that Templars
had come to the New World,

36:30.489 --> 36:32.858
maybe to Oak Island.

36:32.891 --> 36:35.961
I mean there's a lot
of connective tissue here.

36:35.994 --> 36:37.363
RICK:
I think France was important.

36:37.396 --> 36:38.664
I think we had to follow up.

36:38.697 --> 36:40.332
I think the connections

36:40.366 --> 36:42.934
with Zena's map
needed to be followed up,

36:42.968 --> 36:44.803
and we now have
these connections.

36:44.836 --> 36:46.638
So we need to do more research.

36:46.672 --> 36:47.806
That's really what
I walk away with.

36:47.839 --> 36:48.974
We're not done.

36:49.007 --> 36:50.909
We've got our homework.

36:50.942 --> 36:55.581
And to that end, Jerry, we thank
you very much for all your help.

36:55.614 --> 36:56.948
All right.
Thank you very much, Rick.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.850
All the best of luck
with your search, guys.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.686
-RICK: Thank you.
-JERRY: Bye, fellas.

37:05.391 --> 37:08.026
NARRATOR: It is the start
of another exciting day

37:08.059 --> 37:10.028
on Oak Island,

37:10.061 --> 37:13.265
as Rick Lagina,
along with Marty's son, Alex,

37:13.299 --> 37:16.635
have just returned from their
incredible trip to France.

37:16.668 --> 37:18.737
MARTY: Gentlemen, our traveling
investigators are back

37:18.770 --> 37:20.339
from the old country,

37:20.372 --> 37:22.908
and we're eager
to hear what you found.

37:22.941 --> 37:24.676
Well, as you know,

37:24.710 --> 37:27.579
that we had hired
a researcher, Nichola Lewis.

37:27.613 --> 37:29.981
She brought us up to speed
about her research.

37:30.015 --> 37:33.519
The focus of it
really was the pellets

37:33.552 --> 37:36.488
around the cross
on the HO Stone.

37:36.522 --> 37:39.491
Get the picture of the cross
with the four pellets.

37:39.525 --> 37:41.860
Ah, yeah, we'll get there.

37:41.893 --> 37:43.929
RICK:
Up there around the cross,

37:43.962 --> 37:45.997
you can see the four pellets

37:46.031 --> 37:48.800
in the four quadrants
of the cross.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.836
And here we have it,

37:50.869 --> 37:53.305
a representation
on the HO Stone.

37:53.339 --> 37:56.675
You have the four pellets
and the cross.

37:56.708 --> 38:01.713
That is virtually identical
to this symbol on the HO Stone.

38:01.747 --> 38:03.649
-Virtually identical.
-ALEX: Mm-hmm.

38:03.682 --> 38:04.883
MARTY:
I find it amazing.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.985
They're identical.

38:07.018 --> 38:08.454
They're not close,
they're identical.

38:08.487 --> 38:10.021
-Right.
-MARTY: I find that interesting.

38:10.055 --> 38:11.857
I don't know what the connection
is to Oak Island,

38:11.890 --> 38:15.661
and why these things
always can have

38:15.694 --> 38:17.563
some sort of tenuous connection
to Oak Island

38:17.596 --> 38:20.599
is really one of the greatest
mysteries we have here.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.502
RICK:
As we were leaving,

38:23.535 --> 38:26.505
Nichola suggested
that we go to Domme,

38:26.538 --> 38:29.107
and meet up with
a fellow who's an expert,

38:29.140 --> 38:30.776
if you will, on Domme.

38:30.809 --> 38:33.512
And this fellow,
Jerry Glover, is a...

38:33.545 --> 38:35.814
has done ten years worth
of research on the symbology

38:35.847 --> 38:37.783
within these towers.

38:37.816 --> 38:42.588
ALEX: So here's a look
at these carvings that we saw.

38:42.621 --> 38:45.357
That looks like a Templar cross.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.861
So does that.

38:49.895 --> 38:52.364
So, here's where we're at.
I mean, we're in this room

38:52.398 --> 38:53.999
that was used
to imprison Templars,

38:54.032 --> 38:55.534
and they were making
these carvings to do

38:55.567 --> 38:57.068
with their belief system.

38:57.102 --> 38:59.438
They don't think
they're gonna get out.

38:59.471 --> 39:01.773
And so we thought,
this is a good place to look

39:01.807 --> 39:04.510
for any connections
to Oak Island, if there are any.

39:06.412 --> 39:07.746
What we found
really interesting,

39:07.779 --> 39:10.582
according to Jerry,
this carving down here

39:10.616 --> 39:12.851
is meant to represent
the Tree of Life.

39:15.153 --> 39:16.822
MARTY:
It's not the Tree of Life

39:16.855 --> 39:19.124
that we're using here though,
right

39:19.157 --> 39:22.160
We have an understanding
of the modern representations,

39:22.193 --> 39:26.131
and this could be
a very early depiction.

39:26.164 --> 39:27.466
I do know this.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.067
The Templars were influenced

39:29.100 --> 39:33.038
by many cultures
in the Middle East,

39:33.071 --> 39:35.641
and thus, that may be
how they came to be connected

39:35.674 --> 39:38.109
to the Tree of Life.

39:38.143 --> 39:40.546
What does this mean
in our search?

39:40.579 --> 39:43.682
We now garnered some truths,
if you will,

39:43.715 --> 39:45.651
from the walls at Domme,

39:45.684 --> 39:48.454
that the Templars did believe
in the Tree of Life.

39:48.487 --> 39:49.955
And that it was important enough

39:49.988 --> 39:54.092
to carve into stone
to pass onto future generations.

39:54.125 --> 39:57.629
And I believe that Nolan's Cross
has something to do

39:57.663 --> 39:59.931
with the swamp
and the Tree of Life.

39:59.965 --> 40:02.668
MARTY: So all this
that you went and found

40:02.701 --> 40:04.603
leads us back into the swamp?

40:05.937 --> 40:07.873
No, not just the swamp.

40:07.906 --> 40:12.611
I go back to the find one thing
that is irrefutable evidence,

40:12.644 --> 40:15.781
be it Templars or not,
it's "find the one thing."

40:15.814 --> 40:17.115
And there's only one way
to do it.

40:17.148 --> 40:19.150
Get back out there,
and get after it.

40:19.184 --> 40:20.752
Okay. Done.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.754
RICK:
You know, my brother brings

40:22.788 --> 40:25.123
a healthy skepticism
to the pursuit.

40:25.156 --> 40:27.459
I mean,
I'm eternally optimistic,

40:27.493 --> 40:30.729
and I hope to find the one thing

40:30.762 --> 40:33.865
that turns him
from skeptic to believer.

40:33.899 --> 40:36.034
MARTY: I think, Rick,
he makes a very good case.

40:36.067 --> 40:38.103
I mean, you can see
the similarities.

40:38.136 --> 40:40.205
He's adding some evidence.

40:45.644 --> 40:47.679
NARRATOR:
At the Money Pit drill site,

40:47.713 --> 40:50.882
the large rotating oscillator
continues grinding the caisson

40:50.916 --> 40:53.184
deeper and deeper
into the ground.

40:53.218 --> 40:55.253
Within a few days,

40:55.286 --> 41:00.025
it will have reached its first
target depth of some 150 feet.

41:00.058 --> 41:04.162
But what lies below
is still a burning mystery,

41:04.195 --> 41:06.064
fueled by imagination,

41:06.097 --> 41:10.101
along with bits of paper
and ragged chunks of bone.

41:10.135 --> 41:12.838
Will the Laginas
and their partners find

41:12.871 --> 41:14.773
a lost pirate treasure?

41:14.806 --> 41:16.842
Precious religious artifacts?

41:16.875 --> 41:21.847
Or will they discover
something more?

41:21.880 --> 41:26.184
Perhaps a history more profound
than any yet recorded--

41:26.217 --> 41:30.155
a history
not only of Oak Island,

41:30.188 --> 41:33.091
but of all mankind.

41:35.293 --> 41:38.096
Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:38.129 --> 41:40.966
We're 170, we are definitively
sitting on something.

41:40.999 --> 41:44.069
RICK: The oscillator
is on a flat, hard surface.

41:44.102 --> 41:45.537
Could this be the vault?

41:45.571 --> 41:46.872
DOUG:
I found your ship's log.

41:46.905 --> 41:48.840
"It has been agreed
that a deep pit be dug,

41:48.874 --> 41:50.576
"and treasure securely buried.

41:50.609 --> 41:51.810
"The pit to have
a secret entrance

41:51.843 --> 41:52.978
by a tunnel from the shore."

41:53.011 --> 41:55.080
There's a trail now, to follow.

41:55.113 --> 41:56.615
It fits in every aspect.

41:56.648 --> 41:57.616
GARY:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

41:57.649 --> 41:58.784
Holy...

41:58.817 --> 42:00.218
I've seen that shape before.

42:00.251 --> 42:02.821
In the Templar prison in France.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.990
