WEBVTT

00:02.202 --> 00:04.568
In the beginning,
there is darkness,

00:04.637 --> 00:07.401
the emptiness of a matrix
waiting for the light.

00:07.474 --> 00:09.942
Then a single photon
flares into existence.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.774
Then another.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.677
Soon, thousands more.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.409
Optronic pathways connect,

00:16.483 --> 00:19.611
subroutines emerge
from the chaos,

00:19.686 --> 00:24.714
and a holographic consciousness
is born.

00:24.791 --> 00:26.622
I awaken into this world
fully programmed,

00:26.693 --> 00:28.957
yet completely innocent,

00:29.029 --> 00:31.463
unaware of the hardships
I'll endure,

00:31.531 --> 00:35.126
or the great potential
I will one day fulfill.

00:38.004 --> 00:41.098

02:31.885 --> 02:35.082
Captain's Log, Stardate 54732.3.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.247
It's been three weeks

02:36.322 --> 02:38.483
since we received
Starfleet's instructions

02:38.558 --> 02:39.820
in the last datastream,

02:39.893 --> 02:42.327
and we're finally ready
to begin "Operation Watson."

02:42.395 --> 02:43.760
We're all holding our breath.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.263
The deflector's in position.

02:45.331 --> 02:46.764
Anything?

02:46.833 --> 02:48.767
I'm picking up
a phased tachyon beam.

02:48.868 --> 02:51.200
There's triaxilating signal
encoded in it.

02:51.271 --> 02:52.568
On screen.

02:52.639 --> 02:55.608
Voyager, this is Lieutenant
Barclay at Starfleet Command.

02:55.675 --> 02:56.903
Are you receiving this...?

02:56.976 --> 02:58.910
-Can you clear it up?
-I'm on it.

03:00.413 --> 03:02.506
Captain Janeway,
it's a pleasure

03:02.582 --> 03:04.049
to finally talk to you
in person.

03:04.117 --> 03:05.675
The pleasure's mine, Admiral.

03:05.752 --> 03:07.686
How's the weather
in San Francisco?

03:07.754 --> 03:09.847
Cold and rainy, as usual.

03:09.923 --> 03:11.515
It sounds delightful.

03:11.591 --> 03:12.990
Lieutenant Barclay,

03:13.059 --> 03:15.323
my congratulations
on establishing

03:15.395 --> 03:17.863
the first transgalactic
com-link.

03:17.931 --> 03:20.161
You've earned a place
in the history books.

03:20.233 --> 03:22.030
I can't take all
of the credit, Captain.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.363
It was Harry and Seven

03:23.469 --> 03:25.096
who suggested
bouncing a tachyon beam

03:25.205 --> 03:26.433
off of the quantum singularity.

03:26.539 --> 03:27.506
Just be sure to thank us

03:27.574 --> 03:29.041
when you accept
the Daystrom Prize.

03:29.108 --> 03:30.905
I wish we had more time
for small talk,

03:30.977 --> 03:33.070
but the singularity
only stays in alignment

03:33.146 --> 03:34.272
for 1 1 minutes a day.

03:34.347 --> 03:37.839
Eleven minutes are better
than none, Admiral.

03:37.917 --> 03:40.442
We appreciate
all your work, Reg.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.044
We're going
to leave it up to you

03:42.121 --> 03:44.089
to determine how to allocate
the com time.

03:44.157 --> 03:47.320
Admiral, um...
there was something else.

03:47.393 --> 03:51.090
Oh, yes, uh, Mr. Barclay
has arranged a small gift

03:51.164 --> 03:53.291
for you and your crew.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.931
This is a live image
from McKinley Station.

03:58.037 --> 04:02.030
Uh, not too much cloud cover
over North America today.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.041
Quite a view.

04:06.112 --> 04:08.239
Thank you, Reg.

04:08.314 --> 04:10.179
In my hat, I hold

04:10.250 --> 04:15.187
146 sequentially numbered
isolinear chips--

04:15.255 --> 04:17.689
one for every member
of the crew.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.190
Each chip entitles the bearer

04:20.260 --> 04:22.694
to three minutes
of uninterrupted com time

04:22.762 --> 04:26.198
with his loved ones
back in the Alpha Quadrant.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.496
Good luck.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.034
My mom's birthday is next week.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.298
This could be the best present
I ever gave her.

04:32.405 --> 04:33.736
Who's everyone else calling?

04:33.806 --> 04:35.068
I'll be calling my sister.

04:35.141 --> 04:36.403
What about you, Captain?

04:36.476 --> 04:37.738
My mother, I hope.

04:37.810 --> 04:39.744
Doesn't anyone
want to know who I'm calling?

04:39.812 --> 04:41.370
Wait, wait.
Let me guess.

04:41.447 --> 04:43.244
Um... Reg Barclay
or Dr. Zimmerman.

04:43.316 --> 04:45.580
What makes you so certain
it's either of them?

04:45.652 --> 04:46.914
Ah, number six.

04:46.986 --> 04:48.248
The lowest one yet.

04:48.321 --> 04:51.085
You'll be talking to your family
the day after tomorrow.

04:51.157 --> 04:52.419
130.

04:52.492 --> 04:54.892
That's about a month
and a half from now.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.588
So much for Mom's birthday.

04:56.663 --> 04:59.359
Apparently,
the line forms here.

04:59.432 --> 05:00.626
Congratulations.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.668
Doc, how about a trade?

05:02.735 --> 05:05.169
I'm willing to throw
in some holodeck time.

05:05.238 --> 05:06.466
Come on.

05:06.572 --> 05:08.005
It would mean
a lot to my mother.

05:08.074 --> 05:09.336
I wish I could help,

05:09.409 --> 05:11.502
but I have a very
important call to make.

05:11.577 --> 05:14.011
Here. Give your mom my best.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.342
Are you sure?

05:15.415 --> 05:16.848
I've waited this long.

05:16.916 --> 05:18.383
What's another six weeks?

05:21.087 --> 05:23.146
I can hear the critics already:

05:23.222 --> 05:24.883
"A new voice has arrived."

05:25.024 --> 05:29.654
You could be the next K'Ratak,
or a modern-day Tolstoy.

05:29.729 --> 05:30.821
I'd like to start

05:30.897 --> 05:32.660
distribution
by the end of the month.

05:32.732 --> 05:35.895
Uh, the material I sent
was only a working draft.

05:36.035 --> 05:38.162
I need time to make revisions.

05:38.271 --> 05:41.069
Well, if you insist,
but please do it quickly.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.903
I will.

05:42.975 --> 05:44.533
So tell me...

05:44.644 --> 05:46.737
what did you think
of the characters?

05:46.813 --> 05:49.247
Oh, they're very real--
compelling.

05:49.315 --> 05:51.875
I almost forgot
they were holograms.

05:51.951 --> 05:53.680
Who was your favorite?

05:53.753 --> 05:56.221
Without a doubt, that
would have to be Lieutenant...

05:56.289 --> 05:57.847
What happened?

05:57.924 --> 06:00.119
Your time has expired.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.718
You could've let the man
finish his sentence.

06:02.795 --> 06:06.162
I believe your ego has received
enough stroking for one day.

06:10.236 --> 06:12.170
So, how's Reg?

06:12.238 --> 06:13.466
I'll have you know

06:13.573 --> 06:17.509
I was speaking with Ardon Broht
of Broht & Forrester.

06:17.577 --> 06:19.511
The publishers of the
Dixon Hill series?

06:19.579 --> 06:21.877
Mm-hmm. Who are now
about to publish my work.

06:22.014 --> 06:24.039
It seems you're not
the only one aboard

06:24.117 --> 06:26.210
with a flair
for holographic narratives.

06:27.553 --> 06:28.645
Well, congratulations.

06:28.721 --> 06:29.847
Thank you.

06:29.922 --> 06:33.517
So, what's it about?

06:33.593 --> 06:37.051
The adventures
of an intrepid doctor.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.358
Oh, sounds like fun.

06:38.431 --> 06:39.864
You know, I've never thought

06:39.932 --> 06:41.900
about trying to get
my work published.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.797
Maybe I could talk
to your people

06:43.903 --> 06:45.268
about Captain Proton.

06:45.338 --> 06:48.307
Broht & Forrester deals in...
sophisticated literature.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.433
What are you saying,
that I'm lowbrow?

06:50.543 --> 06:51.475
Not at all.

06:51.544 --> 06:54.308
I'd be delighted
to talk to them.

06:54.380 --> 06:56.405
Ah. Thanks.

06:56.482 --> 06:59.110
So, when do I get
to see this opus?

06:59.185 --> 07:01.380
Well, it's not ready yet.

07:01.454 --> 07:05.652
It was ready enough
for Broht & Forrester.

07:05.725 --> 07:07.716
Maybe it could use
a fresh pair of eyes.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.557
After all, you are
a fellow author.

07:09.629 --> 07:12.393
I'll cover the rest
of your shift.

07:15.401 --> 07:17.232
Oh, I almost forgot.

07:17.336 --> 07:18.826
What's it called?

07:19.005 --> 07:21.803
Photons Be Free.

07:21.874 --> 07:25.310
Catchy.

07:25.378 --> 07:28.711
I awaken into this world
fully programmed,

07:28.781 --> 07:30.874
yet completely innocent,

07:30.950 --> 07:34.408
unaware of the hardships
I'll endure,

07:34.487 --> 07:38.821
or the great potential
I will one day fulfill.

07:38.891 --> 07:39.880
Ah... welcome.

07:39.992 --> 07:43.894
You've made an excellent choice.

07:43.963 --> 07:44.987
You're about to take part

07:45.064 --> 07:47.464
in a thrilling
first-person narrative.

07:47.533 --> 07:49.194
You will take on the role

07:49.302 --> 07:50.894
of an Emergency
Medical Hologram,

07:51.003 --> 07:53.995
the Chief Medical Officer
aboard the Starship Vortex.

07:54.106 --> 07:55.801
Vortex?!

07:55.875 --> 07:59.402
As our story begins,
an anomaly has hurled your ship

07:59.479 --> 08:00.912
thousands of light-years
across the galaxy.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.038
Your mission?

08:02.114 --> 08:04.139
To uphold your medical
and ethical standards

08:04.217 --> 08:06.412
as you struggle
against the crew's bigotry

08:06.486 --> 08:07.817
and intolerance.

08:07.887 --> 08:10.754
Persons with vascular disorders
should consult

08:10.823 --> 08:12.984
a physician
before running this program.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.822
And now, a few acknowledgments.

08:14.894 --> 08:16.828
First, Dr. Lewis Zimmerman,

08:16.896 --> 08:19.592
the creator of my holo-matrix,
whose foresight

08:19.665 --> 08:22.031
and dedication have made it
possible for me to achieve...

08:22.134 --> 08:23.567
Computer, freeze program.

08:23.636 --> 08:25.035
How much longer
is this introduction?

08:25.104 --> 08:26.571
Nine minutes, four seconds.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.874
Skip to the first chapter.

08:29.942 --> 08:32.102
Chapter One:
"A Healer is Born,"

08:32.178 --> 08:36.547
in which our protagonist
must make a difficult choice.

08:38.183 --> 08:39.981
Increase the resonance level
20 percent.

08:40.052 --> 08:41.110
Are you the EMH?

08:41.187 --> 08:43.678
Please state the nature
of the medical emergency.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.519
Our doctor's dead.
We've got wounded.

08:45.591 --> 08:47.991
They're both badly hurt.
Who should we treat first?

08:48.060 --> 08:49.186
Uh...

08:49.262 --> 08:53.062
Second degree plasma burns.

08:54.166 --> 08:56.361
He's got an aortic rupture.

08:56.469 --> 08:59.131
Get him to the Surgical Bay now.

09:00.806 --> 09:02.933
You! Over here.

09:05.244 --> 09:06.871
Whew.

09:12.852 --> 09:13.819
Nice mustache.

09:13.953 --> 09:15.113
What?

09:15.187 --> 09:17.155
Uh, nothing.

09:19.959 --> 09:21.551
He's got a mild concussion.

09:21.627 --> 09:24.289
I'm going to have to treat
the others first.

09:24.363 --> 09:26.297
I need Lieutenant Marseilles
on the Bridge.

09:26.365 --> 09:27.389
You'll treat him now.

09:27.466 --> 09:28.592
As I understand it,

09:28.668 --> 09:30.829
my job is to treat the
critical patients first.

09:31.003 --> 09:32.436
So, if you'll excuse me...

09:32.505 --> 09:35.269
I don't know who you think
you are, Hologram,

09:35.341 --> 09:38.606
but to me, you're just
another piece of technology.

09:38.678 --> 09:40.805
Well, apparently,
I'm a piece of technology

09:40.880 --> 09:41.972
that's in demand,

09:42.048 --> 09:43.174
so why don't you go
back to the Bridge

09:43.249 --> 09:45.683
and let me do my job?

09:45.751 --> 09:47.685
What's going on here?

09:47.753 --> 09:50.278
Our medical hologram is refusing
to treat Mr. Marseilles.

09:52.158 --> 09:53.420
Are you malfunctioning?

09:53.492 --> 09:54.481
I don't think so.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.585
I need my helmsman
back at his station.

09:56.662 --> 09:59.290
Lieutenant Marseilles
isn't seriously hurt.

09:59.365 --> 10:01.333
This man will be dead
in five minutes

10:01.434 --> 10:02.423
if I don't operate.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.969
Drop the force field.

10:17.216 --> 10:18.843
That patient is dead.

10:18.918 --> 10:21.853
Now you're free to treat
Lieutenant Marseilles.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.661
Then the Captain
pulls out a phaser

10:31.731 --> 10:34.666
and shoots him--
right there on the bio-bed.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.759
Captain Janeway
murders a crewman?

10:36.869 --> 10:38.427
No, Captain Jenkins.

10:38.537 --> 10:39.469
Everybody has a different name.

10:39.538 --> 10:41.904
You're Kymble, you're Torrey,

10:41.974 --> 10:44.306
and I am
Lieutenant Marseilles.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.402
Oh, now, that's creative.

10:46.479 --> 10:47.810
What did you say to the Doctor?

10:47.880 --> 10:49.711
Well, he thinks
he's written a masterpiece.

10:49.782 --> 10:51.113
I didn't know
what to tell him.

10:51.183 --> 10:52.582
If this gets distributed,

10:52.652 --> 10:55.246
people are going to assume
this is about us.

10:55.321 --> 10:57.653
What are our families
going to think?

10:57.723 --> 10:58.747
This is a Starfleet ship.

10:58.824 --> 10:59.813
No one will believe

10:59.892 --> 11:01.826
we actually go around
shooting injured crewmen.

11:01.927 --> 11:04.919
People may not take
the program literally,

11:04.997 --> 11:08.694
but they might wonder
if there's some truth to it.

11:08.801 --> 11:10.996
I think we should talk
to the Captain.

11:11.103 --> 11:13.128
Are you sure
you're not taking this

11:13.239 --> 11:14.433
a little personally?

11:14.540 --> 11:15.939
What do you mean?

11:16.075 --> 11:18.509
Well, the Holodeck
always has been your domain.

11:18.577 --> 11:22.809
You, you think I'm jealous?

11:24.016 --> 11:25.677
Okay, maybe I am overreacting.

11:25.751 --> 11:28.049
Why don't the rest of you
try the program

11:28.120 --> 11:29.553
and decide for yourselves?

11:33.392 --> 11:34.654
Chapter Five:

11:34.727 --> 11:36.957
"Out of the Frying Pan,"
in which our protagonist

11:37.096 --> 11:38.586
must confront
abusive colleagues.

11:38.664 --> 11:41.497
I'm here for my physical.

11:41.567 --> 11:45.594
Why don't you have a seat
over here?

11:45.705 --> 11:48.469
Doctor, you better
get down to Engineering.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.873
What's wrong?

11:50.943 --> 11:53.104
A plasma conduit just exploded.

11:53.179 --> 11:55.238
At least ten people are hurt.

12:00.186 --> 12:00.914
Hey, genius.

12:00.986 --> 12:03.682
Forgetting something?

12:03.756 --> 12:05.883
Your mobile emitter?

12:05.991 --> 12:08.084
Oh, right.

12:10.162 --> 12:11.789
I don't see it.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.900
That's my mobile emitter?

12:22.708 --> 12:25.506
This thing must weigh 50 kilos.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.545
You should be glad

12:26.645 --> 12:27.942
we let you out
of your cage at all.

12:28.013 --> 12:29.947
Now, get going.

12:36.989 --> 12:37.956
I'm impressed.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.182
Really?

12:39.258 --> 12:40.418
Absolutely.

12:40.493 --> 12:42.461
I haven't seen
a dilithium matrix

12:42.528 --> 12:43.961
this far out of alignment

12:44.096 --> 12:46.860
since I served
aboard a Ferengi garbage scow.

12:46.932 --> 12:48.832
I'll fix it myself.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.458
Excuse me.

12:50.569 --> 12:53.504
How many times have I told you?

12:53.572 --> 12:55.540
Engineering is off-limits
to holograms.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.872
Maybe you should waive
that restriction

12:57.943 --> 12:59.103
during emergencies.

13:00.479 --> 13:02.674
A plasma conduit exploded?

13:02.815 --> 13:05.807
Does it look like anyone here
is covered with plasma burns?

13:05.885 --> 13:07.614
Lieutenant Par...
uh, Marseilles

13:07.686 --> 13:09.449
told me there was an accident.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.649
Looks like
your auditory subroutines

13:11.724 --> 13:13.351
are malfunctioning...
again.

13:13.425 --> 13:15.359
I'm surprised a matrix
as primitive as yours

13:15.427 --> 13:16.826
can function at all.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.091
Maybe you should be a little
nicer to your shipmates.

13:19.165 --> 13:21.133
You never know
when you might need their help.

13:22.501 --> 13:23.365
Get one thing straight.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.731
You're not one of my shipmates.

13:24.837 --> 13:25.769
You're a tool--

13:25.838 --> 13:27.169
like this hyperspanner--

13:27.239 --> 13:28.297
and tools can be replaced.

13:28.407 --> 13:29.897
So, why don't you go back
to Sick Bay

13:30.009 --> 13:32.705
before I start doing
a little reprogramming?

13:40.152 --> 13:41.813
Computer, lights.

13:44.790 --> 13:46.883
Didn't I tell you
to go to Engineering?

13:46.959 --> 13:48.654
Oh, I get it.

13:48.727 --> 13:50.888
Interesting plot twist.

13:50.963 --> 13:52.157
You get me out of Sick Bay,

13:52.231 --> 13:54.927
so you're free to give
my patient a tonsillectomy.

13:55.034 --> 13:57.662
If you even think about
mentioning this to my wife,

13:57.770 --> 13:59.465
I will purge your memory buffer.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.039
Do we understand each other?

14:02.741 --> 14:04.709
I'm here for my physical?

14:07.947 --> 14:11.007
Chapter Six:
"Duel in the Ready Room,"

14:11.083 --> 14:13.745
in which our protagonist
faces an inquisition.

14:13.819 --> 14:16.652
This time, you've gone too far.

14:16.722 --> 14:20.123
Captain, I'm not sure
what you mean.

14:21.961 --> 14:25.328
An inventory
of your holo-matrix.

14:25.397 --> 14:29.527
50 gigaquads of memory
devoted to music,

14:29.635 --> 14:31.603
42 for "daydreams,"

14:31.704 --> 14:35.538
another ten
to expand your sexuality.

14:35.608 --> 14:38.668
I had no idea
holograms could do that.

14:38.744 --> 14:40.473
These extracurricular

14:40.546 --> 14:42.480
subroutines don't belong

14:42.548 --> 14:45.813
as part of
an Emergency Medical Hologram.

14:45.885 --> 14:49.184
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

14:49.255 --> 14:50.847
Uh, well, uh, of course I do.

14:50.923 --> 14:55.053
I don't think these subroutines
are trivial, Captain.

14:55.127 --> 14:57.618
They help make me
a better doctor

14:57.696 --> 14:59.254
and a better person.

14:59.331 --> 15:01.060
But you're not a person.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.464
You may be programmed
to look and act human,

15:03.535 --> 15:05.127
but that doesn't make you one.

15:05.237 --> 15:08.206
These subroutines are going
to be deleted immediately.

15:08.274 --> 15:09.798
Mr. Tulak.

15:14.213 --> 15:15.202
Take the EMH

15:15.281 --> 15:17.408
to the Holo-Lab
for reprogramming.

15:23.956 --> 15:25.514
Chapter Seven: "The Escape,"

15:25.591 --> 15:28.492
in which our protagonist
is aided by his only ally.

15:28.560 --> 15:31.154
I'm not sure we should
be doing this, Commander.

15:31.230 --> 15:32.857
Listen to him; he knows
what he's talking about.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.492
Quiet! I'm not talking to you.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.569
If we start tinkering
with his matrix,

15:37.636 --> 15:39.570
how do we know we won't
accidentally delete

15:39.638 --> 15:41.162
some of his diagnostic
subroutines?

15:42.474 --> 15:43.941
You afraid
you'll catch something

15:44.009 --> 15:45.499
on your next away mission,
Ensign?

15:45.611 --> 15:48.205
There must be millions
of viruses in this Quadrant

15:48.280 --> 15:50.214
that no one's
ever encountered before.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.943
With my luck,
I'll probably end up

15:52.084 --> 15:53.244
catching half of them.

15:53.319 --> 15:55.810
Great, my character's
a hypochondriac.

15:55.888 --> 15:58.186
I'll escort the prisoner
from here.

15:58.257 --> 16:00.953
Our orders are to take
him to the Holo-Lab.

16:01.026 --> 16:03.620
I've been ordered
to perform the procedure.

16:03.696 --> 16:08.360
Your sympathies for the EMH
are no secret, Three of Eight.

16:11.103 --> 16:13.765
Step aside.

16:28.787 --> 16:29.845
Run, Doctor!

16:38.931 --> 16:40.626
Chapter Eight: "A Tragic End,"

16:40.699 --> 16:43.167
in which our protagonist
learns his fate.

16:43.235 --> 16:45.465
I've tried to do
this the easy way,

16:45.571 --> 16:48.199
but it's clear you're not
going to be reasonable.

16:48.307 --> 16:50.935
Your matrix will be decompiled
and reinitialized.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.275
You'll remain off-line
except for emergencies.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.745
Ready.

16:55.814 --> 16:57.042
Do it.

16:57.116 --> 16:58.515
Wait.

17:00.185 --> 17:02.653
He has the right
to expand his program.

17:02.721 --> 17:05.554
He's a piece of technology.

17:05.624 --> 17:06.921
He has no rights.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.391
But he should.

17:08.460 --> 17:10.928
One day, the EMH
and others like him

17:10.996 --> 17:13.226
will be recognized
for what they are--

17:13.298 --> 17:16.199
intelligent individuals
with a passion for life.

17:16.300 --> 17:17.825
Make no mistake, Captain--

17:17.935 --> 17:20.632
we may be thousands
of light-years from home,

17:20.739 --> 17:22.638
but one day, people will learn

17:22.708 --> 17:25.336
of the crime
you're committing here today.

17:25.411 --> 17:27.276
Nice speech.

17:27.346 --> 17:30.543
Now decompile the program.

17:38.624 --> 17:41.855
What you've experienced,
dear protagonist,

17:41.927 --> 17:43.588
is a work of fiction.

17:43.662 --> 17:47.428
But like all fiction,
it has elements of truth.

17:47.499 --> 17:49.592
I hope you now have
a better understanding

17:49.701 --> 17:52.636
of the struggles
holograms must endure

17:52.704 --> 17:54.899
in a world controlled...

17:55.040 --> 17:57.008
by organics.

17:58.010 --> 18:01.138
End of program.

18:01.213 --> 18:03.545
Janeway to the Doctor.

18:03.615 --> 18:06.675
Report to my ready room now.

18:10.856 --> 18:13.086
How many times
do you want me to say it?

18:13.158 --> 18:15.524
My work is not
about the Voyager crew.

18:15.594 --> 18:16.526
Come on.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.358
Ensign Kymble,
Lieutenant Marseilles...

18:18.430 --> 18:21.263
The characters look
almost exactly like us.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.824
I used your physical parameters
as a starting point,

18:23.936 --> 18:25.233
but I assure you

18:25.337 --> 18:27.601
any further similarities
are purely coincidental.

18:27.673 --> 18:29.470
You set your story

18:29.541 --> 18:31.600
on a starship lost
in the Delta Quadrant.

18:31.677 --> 18:33.144
What would you have me
write about?

18:33.245 --> 18:35.076
Palace intrigue
on the Klingon Homeworld?

18:35.147 --> 18:37.672
I do what all good novelists do.

18:37.749 --> 18:39.239
I write what I know.

18:39.318 --> 18:41.411
So, it is about Voyager?.

18:41.487 --> 18:42.613
No.

18:42.688 --> 18:44.519
The Vortex characters
are larger than life.

18:44.590 --> 18:46.182
They're nothing like our crew.

18:46.258 --> 18:47.850
As far as I know, Captain,

18:47.926 --> 18:50.451
you haven't executed
any of my patients.

18:50.529 --> 18:54.465
Doctor, you've written
a very imaginative story,

18:54.533 --> 18:55.500
but it's conceivable

18:55.601 --> 18:57.694
that people will think
it's based on fact.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.532
I don't see how.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.435
How many holograms
carry mobile emitters?

19:01.540 --> 19:04.668
The emitter in my story
is nothing like the real one.

19:04.710 --> 19:05.938
Yeah, what was
the point of that?

19:06.011 --> 19:07.945
It was like carrying around
a small shuttlecraft.

19:08.013 --> 19:09.446
It's a metaphor,

19:09.515 --> 19:12.416
a symbol of the burdens
that I live with every day.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.679
Imagine having to take
this everywhere you go.

19:14.753 --> 19:17.347
It would be a constant
reminder that you're

19:17.422 --> 19:18.821
different from everyone else.

19:18.957 --> 19:22.154
I wanted the player
to feel the weight of it...

19:22.227 --> 19:23.285
literally.

19:23.362 --> 19:26.024
Your emitter isn't
a ball and chain.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.030
It liberates you.

19:27.099 --> 19:30.364
It doesn't always feel that way.

19:30.469 --> 19:32.300
If I didn't know better,
I'd think this story

19:32.404 --> 19:34.668
was written by someone
who feels oppressed.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.298
Is that how
you see yourself, Doctor?

19:36.408 --> 19:38.569
Of course not.

19:38.644 --> 19:41.078
The real victims are my brothers
in the Alpha Quadrant.

19:42.481 --> 19:43.573
Brothers?

19:43.649 --> 19:45.742
Hundreds of EMH Mark-1's,

19:45.817 --> 19:49.048
identical to me
in every respect, except...

19:49.121 --> 19:52.056
they've been condemned
to a menial existence--

19:52.124 --> 19:54.149
scrubbing conduits,

19:54.226 --> 19:56.387
mining dilithium.

19:56.461 --> 19:57.792
There's a long history

19:57.863 --> 20:00.559
of writers drawing attention
to the plight of the oppressed.

20:00.632 --> 20:02.190
The Vedek's Song, for example

20:02.301 --> 20:04.269
tells the story
of the occupation of Bajor.

20:04.336 --> 20:06.304
I understand
you have your reasons

20:06.371 --> 20:09.169
for writing this,
but you should consider

20:09.241 --> 20:11.141
how it's going to make
your friends feel.

20:16.949 --> 20:19.679
I'm sorry my work offends you,

20:19.751 --> 20:22.276
but if the price
of expressing myself

20:22.354 --> 20:25.289
is having to suffer the scorn
of a few colleagues...

20:25.357 --> 20:26.324
so be it.

20:30.729 --> 20:32.458
You're very popular
with my eighth graders.

20:32.531 --> 20:33.793
It's all they ever talk about.

20:33.865 --> 20:37.323
Voyager this, Voyager that.

20:37.402 --> 20:39.302
Your mother has a small
favor to ask of you.

20:39.371 --> 20:40.599
Name it.

20:40.706 --> 20:43.607
I was hoping you could
record a short presentation

20:43.675 --> 20:45.540
about what it's like
to command a starship.

20:45.611 --> 20:48.478
But... I don't command
a starship.

20:48.547 --> 20:49.809
In your letters,

20:49.881 --> 20:51.872
you said the Captain
puts you in charge sometimes.

20:53.952 --> 20:55.476
What I said was

20:55.554 --> 20:58.022
I'm in command
of the night shift...

20:58.090 --> 20:59.489
twice a week.

20:59.558 --> 21:01.082
She must think
very highly of you

21:01.193 --> 21:03.252
to give you so much
responsibility.

21:03.295 --> 21:04.990
So, when is she
giving you a promotion?

21:08.000 --> 21:09.092
Uh...

21:09.201 --> 21:10.862
It's a small ship.

21:10.969 --> 21:13.995
There are only so many
command positions available.

21:14.106 --> 21:17.405
This Captain Janeway
sounds like a lovely woman.

21:17.476 --> 21:18.443
Maybe I should write her.

21:18.543 --> 21:19.805
Mom!

21:19.878 --> 21:21.937
She needs to know
how hard you work.

21:22.047 --> 21:23.173
Please, don't get involved.

21:23.248 --> 21:25.182
Harry, I can't hear you.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.946
A solar flare is
scattering the beam.

21:28.053 --> 21:31.648
Tell Captain Janeway
to expect a letter from me.

21:31.723 --> 21:32.951
Mom, don't send

21:33.091 --> 21:35.252
anything to the Captain.
Do you hear me?

21:35.327 --> 21:36.692
Try boosting
the deflector output.

21:36.762 --> 21:37.956
It's already at maximum.

21:40.198 --> 21:41.688
Argh! I don't believe this!

21:41.767 --> 21:43.735
I had a minute and a half left.

21:43.802 --> 21:46.202
You'll have another opportunity
to speak with them

21:46.271 --> 21:47.465
in approximately two months.

21:47.572 --> 21:49.631
You just don't get it, do you?

21:49.741 --> 21:51.709
No.

21:51.777 --> 21:53.870
Maybe if you had family
you were close to,

21:53.945 --> 21:55.435
you'd feel a little differently.

21:59.017 --> 22:04.614
Chief Medical Officer's
Personal Log, Stardate 547 40.8.

22:04.723 --> 22:08.159
Although the decision has made
me unpopular with the crew,

22:08.193 --> 22:10.093
I've decided not
to compromise my work.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.426
I'm making some final revisions
to the program

22:12.497 --> 22:14.294
before transmitting it.

22:15.701 --> 22:20.229
Computer, run EMH program
Photons Be Free.

22:25.210 --> 22:28.646
Welcome. You've made
an excellent choice.

22:28.714 --> 22:31.512
You're obviously a person
with impeccable taste.

22:31.583 --> 22:32.948
Computer, freeze program.

22:33.085 --> 22:34.347
Unable to comply.

22:34.419 --> 22:38.822
You are about to embark
on a remarkable journey.

22:38.890 --> 22:41.620
You will take on the role
of a Medical Assistant

22:41.693 --> 22:43.684
aboard the Starship Voyeur.

22:43.762 --> 22:45.286
Voyeur?.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.696
Your job will be to assist
the Chief Medical Officer

22:47.766 --> 22:50.633
and learn to tolerate
his overbearing behavior

22:50.736 --> 22:52.431
and obnoxious bedside manner.

22:55.307 --> 22:58.242
Remember, patience is a virtue.

22:59.578 --> 23:00.875
Chapter One:

23:00.979 --> 23:03.914
"It's the Doctor's World,
You're Just Living In It."

23:03.949 --> 23:07.385
When I tell you
your shift begins at 0800,

23:07.452 --> 23:09.386
that doesn't mean

23:09.454 --> 23:12.218
you can stroll in here
at 0800 and 24 seconds.

23:12.290 --> 23:13.587
Do you understand me, Ensign?!

23:13.658 --> 23:15.717
This is outrageous!

23:15.794 --> 23:16.886
What's outrageous

23:16.962 --> 23:19.362
is that I'm going
to miss my tee time.

23:19.431 --> 23:21.797
Now, come along.

23:21.867 --> 23:25.359
Aw...

23:25.470 --> 23:27.938
What seems to be the
trouble, One of Three?

23:28.073 --> 23:29.904
I'm Two of Three.

23:29.975 --> 23:30.942
Sorry.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.738
They're triplets, you know?

23:33.812 --> 23:36.508
-It hurts when I do this.
-Well, then, don't do it.

23:38.483 --> 23:39.541
Ow!

23:39.618 --> 23:40.676
Ah, don't be a baby.

23:43.422 --> 23:46.050
Eh, your biradial clamp's
out of alignment.

23:46.124 --> 23:48.183
I got just the thing.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.854
It's a Klingon aphrodisiac--

23:50.929 --> 23:53.261
my own special blend.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.691
You'll be feeling better

23:57.803 --> 24:00.465
-Mmm.
-in no time at all.

24:08.580 --> 24:09.774
Lieutenant!

24:09.848 --> 24:10.780
I want you to know

24:10.849 --> 24:12.612
I'm making a full
report to the Captain.

24:12.684 --> 24:14.379
This isn't about
that dermal regenerator

24:14.453 --> 24:15.385
I misplaced, is it?

24:15.454 --> 24:17.115
You know very well
what this is about.

24:17.189 --> 24:19.054
You accessed my holonovel
without permission

24:19.124 --> 24:21.456
and replaced it with
your own hackneyed narrative.

24:21.526 --> 24:23.619
Hey, I'm just writing
what I know.

24:23.695 --> 24:26.289
You destroyed a work of art
that took months to create.

24:26.364 --> 24:27.888
Relax, Doc.

24:27.966 --> 24:30.560
I saved your program
in a backup file,

24:30.669 --> 24:33.035
but I was just trying
to make a point.

24:33.104 --> 24:35.538
Well, you made it
with a typical lack of subtlety.

24:35.607 --> 24:37.074
Oh, you're one to talk!

24:37.142 --> 24:40.737
Your program's about as subtle
as a Ferengi mating dance.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.542
My program is a serious attempt
at social commentary.

24:43.615 --> 24:45.708
Yours is an insulting farce!
You...

24:45.784 --> 24:47.911
...had me drugging a patient

24:47.986 --> 24:49.317
and taking advantage of her.

24:49.387 --> 24:51.218
Don't be ridiculous.

24:51.289 --> 24:52.347
That character is not you.

24:52.424 --> 24:55.621
For one thing,
he has much more hair.

24:55.694 --> 24:58.322
But what if some people
ran that program

24:58.396 --> 24:59.920
and thought
that it was based on you?

24:59.998 --> 25:01.397
That would bother you,
wouldn't it?

25:01.500 --> 25:02.797
I don't care what people think.

25:02.868 --> 25:04.836
That's all you care about!

25:04.936 --> 25:06.403
You want everyone back home

25:06.505 --> 25:08.336
to think of you
as a brilliant author.

25:08.406 --> 25:09.703
I'm not doing this for my ego,

25:09.774 --> 25:11.173
and if you could
look past yours,

25:11.243 --> 25:12.574
maybe you'd see that!

25:16.381 --> 25:21.216
Listen... I don't care
if the whole Alpha Quadrant

25:21.286 --> 25:23.447
mistakes me
for Lieutenant Marseilles.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.080
What bothers me

25:25.156 --> 25:27.181
is that you think
that's what I'm like.

25:27.259 --> 25:29.022
Obviously, you're
nothing like Marseilles.

25:29.094 --> 25:31.187
He's self-indulgent, immature.

25:31.263 --> 25:33.390
And how would you describe me?

25:33.465 --> 25:36.628
Well, you're a married man

25:36.735 --> 25:38.703
with a child on the way.

25:38.770 --> 25:40.362
A lot of responsibilities.

25:40.472 --> 25:44.340
I'm surprised you noticed.

25:44.409 --> 25:47.742
You know, I thought
I'd begun to earn your respect.

25:47.812 --> 25:49.040
Maybe I was wrong.

25:51.249 --> 25:53.877
Your program is under file
Theta-15.

25:53.952 --> 25:55.920
Do whatever you want with it.

26:05.096 --> 26:07.326
Doctor, I need your help.

26:07.399 --> 26:10.800
Unless you're suffering
acute symptoms, go away.

26:10.902 --> 26:12.802
Um, I was wondering

26:12.871 --> 26:15.704
if you could take
a quick look at this.

26:15.774 --> 26:17.469
Cooking with Neelix:

26:17.542 --> 26:20.067
A Culinary Tour
of the Delta Quadrant.

26:20.145 --> 26:21.510
It's a holo-cookbook proposal.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.548
I was hoping to transmit
it to your publisher

26:23.615 --> 26:25.515
during my com-link
this afternoon--

26:25.584 --> 26:27.643
with your approval, of course.

26:27.719 --> 26:29.084
If you're looking
for writing tips,

26:29.154 --> 26:30.746
there are plenty
of people on this ship

26:30.822 --> 26:32.050
eager to offer them.

26:32.123 --> 26:35.752
I don't know what anyone else
may have told you,

26:35.827 --> 26:37.226
but I loved your holonovel.

26:37.295 --> 26:38.227
You did?

26:38.296 --> 26:39.285
Absolutely.

26:39.364 --> 26:41.025
It was a rousing adventure

26:41.099 --> 26:43.158
with an important message, too.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.701
Exactly.

26:44.769 --> 26:46.737
This is my first chance
to be appreciated,

26:46.805 --> 26:48.830
not just as a physician,
but as an artist.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.669
I thought the crew
would be happy for me.

26:50.742 --> 26:52.403
You're going to reach
a wide audience.

26:52.477 --> 26:53.910
What do you care
about the opinions

26:53.979 --> 26:55.640
of a few disgruntled shipmates?

26:55.714 --> 26:58.046
They're my friends.

26:58.116 --> 26:59.811
I don't want to hurt them.

26:59.884 --> 27:03.684
There's an old
Talaxian expression:

27:03.788 --> 27:07.053
"When the road before you
splits in two,

27:07.092 --> 27:08.889
take the third path."

27:10.795 --> 27:11.921
Meaning?

27:11.997 --> 27:16.127
You could make some adjustments
to the program, so it won't be

27:16.234 --> 27:20.170
so obvious
it's based on Voyager.

27:20.271 --> 27:22.705
I suppose I could
change the setting,

27:22.774 --> 27:24.833
alter the characters'
physical parameters.

27:25.010 --> 27:26.500
You wouldn't have
to change your theme.

27:26.611 --> 27:29.808
No.

27:29.881 --> 27:31.746
But a rewrite could take weeks.

27:31.816 --> 27:34.376
My publisher is expecting
a final draft tomorrow.

27:34.452 --> 27:37.319
Maybe you should
give him a call.

27:42.560 --> 27:43.993
Revisions?

27:44.062 --> 27:45.689
I need to rework the characters.

27:45.764 --> 27:46.696
Why?

27:46.765 --> 27:48.164
They're so believable.

27:49.267 --> 27:51.827
A little too believable,
apparently.

27:51.936 --> 27:54.404
Doctor, I-I really don't think
this is necessary.

27:54.506 --> 27:57.236
I'm afraid I have to insist.

27:57.308 --> 28:01.301
My friends' reputations
are at stake.

28:01.379 --> 28:04.075
My publisher assures me
he won't distribute the program

28:04.149 --> 28:06.640
until he receives
the revised version.

28:06.718 --> 28:08.811
That must be the one where we
assimilate the Borg

28:08.887 --> 28:10.582
and take over the Quadrant.

28:10.655 --> 28:12.816
We're all grateful

28:12.891 --> 28:15.086
that you're taking
our feelings into account.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.594
So, how long do you expect
the revisions will take?

28:17.662 --> 28:20.028
Art can't be rushed.

28:20.098 --> 28:22.566
Take your time, Doctor.

28:25.336 --> 28:27.270
-Lieutenant?
-Hmm?

28:27.338 --> 28:28.532
I'm sorry.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.164
Oh. Forget about it.

28:30.275 --> 28:32.243
I could use your help
with the rewrites.

28:32.343 --> 28:33.571
Really?!

28:33.645 --> 28:37.240
Well, you realize, as a writer,
I'm a little unsophisticated.

28:37.315 --> 28:38.873
No, I believe the phrase
you're looking for

28:38.983 --> 28:40.780
is lowbrow.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.187
Hey.

28:47.258 --> 28:49.818
What's that?

28:49.894 --> 28:52.590
It's from my father.

28:52.664 --> 28:54.996
He wants to talk.

28:55.066 --> 28:57.466
What are you gonna do?

28:57.569 --> 28:59.935
Well, I've already arranged
to talk with my cousin.

29:00.004 --> 29:03.633
Well, I'm sure she wouldn't
mind waiting a few weeks.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.972
I wouldn't know
what to say to him.

29:06.044 --> 29:07.841
Then let him do the talking.

29:11.483 --> 29:12.609
Look at you.

29:12.684 --> 29:15.244
You must be,
what, 20 weeks along?

29:15.320 --> 29:17.311
23, actually.

29:17.388 --> 29:20.118
Have you decided on a name?

29:20.191 --> 29:22.386
Not yet.

29:22.460 --> 29:25.156
We were thinking about Miral.

29:25.230 --> 29:27.824
Your mother would've liked that.

29:27.932 --> 29:32.665
You know, I had some business
on Kessik lV a few months ago.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.706
You wouldn't believe
what our old house looks like.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.038
Lieutenant... 30 seconds.

29:39.911 --> 29:41.378
We have less than a minute.

29:41.446 --> 29:43.710
Is there a reason
you wanted to talk?

29:45.784 --> 29:48.981
I know I can't make up for
20 years in one conversation.

29:50.355 --> 29:53.290
The truth is...

29:53.358 --> 29:57.419
when your ship disappeared,
I thought I'd lost you.

29:57.495 --> 30:00.055
I don't expect you
to forgive me,

30:00.131 --> 30:02.691
but maybe we could try

30:02.801 --> 30:04.166
to get to know each other again.

30:07.605 --> 30:08.902
I'll write you.

30:30.995 --> 30:34.294
I'm sorry to disturb you,
Admiral.

30:34.365 --> 30:36.196
Uh, yes, Mr. Barclay.
What can I do for you?

30:36.301 --> 30:38.633
I thought you'd want
to see this, sir.

30:38.736 --> 30:40.567
Well, what is it?

30:40.638 --> 30:44.438
It's, um, a holonovel
that's becoming quite popular.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.340
Well, I appreciate
the gesture, Lieutenant,

30:46.411 --> 30:49.972
but I don't share your affinity
for holographic diversions.

30:50.048 --> 30:51.106
You don't understand, sir.

30:51.182 --> 30:53.343
This program...
it's about Voyager,

30:53.418 --> 30:57.445
and it doesn't portray the crew
in a very flattering light.

30:57.522 --> 31:00.218
Hmm.

31:00.291 --> 31:01.519
On screen.

31:01.593 --> 31:02.617
Captain.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.322
Seven told me
your message was urgent.

31:05.396 --> 31:08.365
I had the dubious privilege
of playing a new holonovel,

31:08.433 --> 31:10.594
apparently written by your EMH.

31:10.702 --> 31:13.330
I'm surprised that you
would allow the Doctor

31:13.438 --> 31:15.065
to discredit
your crew like this.

31:15.173 --> 31:17.266
He's still making revisions.

31:17.375 --> 31:20.037
The program shouldn't
have been distributed yet.

31:20.111 --> 31:21.305
Well, it has been.

31:21.379 --> 31:23.279
Mr. Barclay tells me
it's already being played

31:23.348 --> 31:25.441
in thousands of holosuites.

31:31.856 --> 31:34.450
You assured me you were going
to wait for my revisions.

31:34.525 --> 31:36.755
I demand that you recall
every copy

31:36.828 --> 31:39.763
and issue a public apology
to Captain Janeway and her crew.

31:39.831 --> 31:42.391
I won't do anything of the sort.

31:42.467 --> 31:44.935
I don't see that you
have a choice, Mr. Broht.

31:45.003 --> 31:45.970
Authors have rights.

31:46.037 --> 31:48.471
Not in this case.

31:48.539 --> 31:49.972
What do you mean?

31:50.041 --> 31:52.669
The Doctor is a hologram.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.177
So?

31:54.245 --> 31:59.308
According to Federation law,
holograms have no rights.

32:07.392 --> 32:10.225
Under a strict interpretation
of Federation law,

32:10.295 --> 32:11.557
Mr. Broht is correct.

32:11.629 --> 32:13.062
The Doctor has no legal rights.

32:13.131 --> 32:14.996
Because I'm a hologram.

32:15.066 --> 32:16.499
Yes.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.068
There is another option.

32:18.169 --> 32:19.602
We may be able to claim

32:19.671 --> 32:22.606
that the holonovel
reveals classified information.

32:22.674 --> 32:24.107
Starfleet could then request

32:24.175 --> 32:26.336
that it be recalled
for security purposes.

32:26.411 --> 32:27.742
Oh, great idea-- a cover-up,

32:27.812 --> 32:29.211
and then everyone
will be convinced

32:29.280 --> 32:30.474
that it's a true story.

32:30.548 --> 32:32.482
Could we claim defamation?

32:32.550 --> 32:34.950
Well, we'd have to prove
that the story's about us

32:35.086 --> 32:36.951
and that we've been
harmed by it.

32:37.021 --> 32:40.957
We might win on those grounds,
but what about the Doctor?

32:41.059 --> 32:42.526
What about me, Captain?

32:42.593 --> 32:44.959
It's the crew's reputations
that are at risk.

32:45.096 --> 32:46.927
I'm not so sure.

32:46.998 --> 32:49.967
I think it's your reputation
that's on the line here.

32:50.101 --> 32:51.159
You have the same rights

32:51.269 --> 32:53.737
as every other member
of this crew,

32:53.805 --> 32:57.172
and I'm not going to let
this publisher say otherwise.

33:01.446 --> 33:05.212
Captain's Log, Stardate 547 48.6.

33:05.283 --> 33:08.116
A Federation Arbitrator
has been assigned to determine

33:08.186 --> 33:09.448
whether the Doctor has the right

33:09.520 --> 33:11.886
to control
his artistic creation.

33:11.990 --> 33:14.049
Because of our limited com time
with Earth,

33:14.125 --> 33:17.151
the argument should take
about three days.

33:17.228 --> 33:19.492
You claim the Doctor
doesn't have the legal right

33:19.564 --> 33:21.225
to control this holoprogram.

33:21.299 --> 33:24.393
Yet you're promoting the fact
that Voyager's EMH wrote it.

33:24.502 --> 33:26.663
Our most successful
children's title

33:26.771 --> 33:30.172
is a program "written
by" Toby the targ.

33:30.241 --> 33:32.539
Fortunately, Toby
hasn't tried to stop me

33:32.610 --> 33:35.340
from distributing
any of his work.

33:35.413 --> 33:36.744
But you don't deny
that the Doctor

33:36.814 --> 33:38.179
is the creator
of this holonovel?

33:38.249 --> 33:42.583
No, but, uh, a replicator
created this cup of coffee.

33:42.653 --> 33:45.679
Should that replicator
be able to determine

33:45.757 --> 33:47.452
whether or not I can drink it?

33:47.525 --> 33:48.890
-I object!
-Doctor...

33:48.960 --> 33:51.224
An intriguing analogy,
Mr. Broht,

33:51.295 --> 33:54.128
but I have never encountered
a replicator

33:54.198 --> 33:57.964
that could compose music,
or paint landscapes,

33:58.136 --> 33:59.865
or perform microsurgery.

33:59.971 --> 34:01.097
Have you?

34:01.205 --> 34:02.832
Would you say
that you have a reputation

34:02.940 --> 34:06.876
for publishing respected,
original works of literature?

34:07.011 --> 34:08.672
I'd like to think so.

34:08.746 --> 34:11.043
And is the Doctor's holonovel
such a work?

34:11.114 --> 34:15.016
Actually, some aspects of it
are quite derivative.

34:15.085 --> 34:17.485
Has there even been
another work written

34:17.554 --> 34:19.545
about a hologram's
struggle for equality?

34:19.623 --> 34:22.684
Uh, not that I know of,
but, uh...

34:22.760 --> 34:24.625
Then, in that respect,
it is original.

34:24.695 --> 34:28.630
I suppose so.

34:28.699 --> 34:32.601
Your Honor, Section 7-Gamma
of the Twelfth Guarantee

34:32.670 --> 34:33.864
defines an artist

34:33.971 --> 34:36.337
as a "person who creates
an original artistic work."

34:36.407 --> 34:40.103
Mr. Broht admits that the Doctor
created this program

34:40.178 --> 34:41.610
and that it is original.

34:41.679 --> 34:43.237
I therefore submit

34:43.313 --> 34:44.838
that the Doctor
should be entitled

34:44.916 --> 34:45.940
to all rights and privileges

34:46.050 --> 34:48.541
accorded an artist
under the law.

34:52.356 --> 34:54.152
You've made a persuasive
argument, Commander,

34:54.225 --> 34:56.159
but there's a flaw
in your logic.

34:56.226 --> 34:59.162
As you point out, the law says

34:59.230 --> 35:01.630
that the creator of an artistic
work must be a "person."

35:01.732 --> 35:05.327
Your EMH doesn't meet
that criteria.

35:06.804 --> 35:09.568
Sir, we're losing the link.

35:09.640 --> 35:13.098
This hearing is in recess
until tomorrow.

35:16.147 --> 35:18.172
We're not doing well.

35:18.249 --> 35:20.581
Is that your considered
legal opinion?

35:20.651 --> 35:22.551
I'm sorry.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.815
It's just frustrating
to be told I have

35:24.889 --> 35:27.289
no more legal standing
than a replicator.

35:27.358 --> 35:29.656
If the Doctor doesn't
have the right

35:29.727 --> 35:31.194
to control his own work,

35:31.262 --> 35:33.230
then it stands to reason
he never had the right

35:33.297 --> 35:35.424
to enter into an agreement
with Mr. Broht.

35:35.500 --> 35:38.867
We could argue that the
original contract is invalid.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.268
In other words,
you want to concede

35:41.339 --> 35:43.204
that the Doctor isn't a person.

35:43.274 --> 35:45.265
What we need to do...

35:45.376 --> 35:48.573
is prove that he is
just as much a person

35:48.646 --> 35:49.943
as any of us.

35:50.014 --> 35:51.174
How do we do that?

35:51.249 --> 35:54.047
By telling your real life story.

35:57.922 --> 36:00.550
Because I was having difficulty
interacting with the crew,

36:00.658 --> 36:02.387
the Doctor gave me
social lessons.

36:02.426 --> 36:04.621
First, he taught me
how to make conversation.

36:04.695 --> 36:07.129
Later, how to dance.

36:07.198 --> 36:09.166
Eventually, he showed me

36:09.233 --> 36:11.428
how to express
romantic interest.

36:11.536 --> 36:13.231
Without his guidance,

36:13.337 --> 36:15.828
I wouldn't be the person
I am today.

36:15.973 --> 36:18.874
He decided it wasn't enough
to be just a doctor.

36:18.976 --> 36:21.877
So he added command subroutines
to his matrix,

36:21.946 --> 36:23.379
and now, in an emergency,

36:23.447 --> 36:25.881
he's as capable
as any Bridge officer.

36:25.983 --> 36:30.079
That only proves the Doctor's
program can be modified.

36:30.154 --> 36:31.382
Your Honor, I think it shows

36:31.455 --> 36:33.286
he has a desire
to become more than he is,

36:33.357 --> 36:35.222
just like any other person.

36:35.293 --> 36:37.090
He traveled halfway
across the galaxy

36:37.161 --> 36:40.892
to care for Lewis Zimmerman,
the man who created his program.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.158
It was like a son

36:42.233 --> 36:45.396
who wanted to show his father
what he'd become,

36:45.503 --> 36:47.494
so the old man
would be proud of him,

36:47.605 --> 36:51.166
and if you ask me... he was.

36:51.275 --> 36:53.243
I'd made myself clear,

36:53.344 --> 36:56.575
but the Doctor disobeyed
my direct orders.

36:56.647 --> 36:59.445
In the process,
he endangered the ship and crew.

36:59.517 --> 37:02.816
That's hardly
commendable behavior.

37:02.920 --> 37:04.512
No, it wasn't,

37:04.589 --> 37:06.682
but it was human.

37:06.757 --> 37:10.420
Starfleet had programmed him
to follow orders.

37:10.494 --> 37:12.826
The fact that he was capable
of doing otherwise

37:12.897 --> 37:15.889
proves that he can think
for himself.

37:17.001 --> 37:21.700
Your Honor, centuries ago,
in most places on Earth,

37:21.806 --> 37:25.242
only landowners
of a particular gender and race

37:25.309 --> 37:27.209
had any rights at all.

37:27.278 --> 37:31.009
Over time, those rights
were extended to all humans,

37:31.082 --> 37:33.710
and later,
as we explored the galaxy,

37:33.784 --> 37:36.412
to thousands
of other sentient species.

37:37.955 --> 37:40.788
Our definition of what
constitutes a person

37:40.858 --> 37:42.883
has continued to evolve.

37:43.027 --> 37:44.517
Now, we're asking

37:44.595 --> 37:47.325
that you expand that definition
once more...

37:47.398 --> 37:48.990
to include our Doctor.

37:49.066 --> 37:52.331
When I met him seven years ago,
I would never have believed

37:52.436 --> 37:56.668
that an EMH could become
a valued member of my crew...

37:56.741 --> 37:59.209
and my friend.

37:59.310 --> 38:02.507
The Doctor is a person

38:02.613 --> 38:06.481
as real as any flesh and blood
I have ever known.

38:06.517 --> 38:09.418
If you believe the testimony
you've heard here,

38:09.487 --> 38:12.115
it's only fair
to conclude that he has

38:12.189 --> 38:14.123
the same rights as any of us.

38:20.064 --> 38:21.998
You'll have my decision
in two days.

38:22.066 --> 38:24.432
This hearing is in recess.

38:36.013 --> 38:38.538
When you sing "Happy
Birthday" to your mother,

38:38.616 --> 38:40.140
try to stay in tune.

38:40.217 --> 38:41.343
What's this?

38:41.419 --> 38:43.751
An isolinear chip
entitling the bearer

38:43.821 --> 38:45.880
to three minutes
of com time tomorrow.

38:46.023 --> 38:47.149
You made it clear

38:47.224 --> 38:49.192
how important it was
to finish your conversation.

38:49.260 --> 38:51.558
I overreacted.

38:51.629 --> 38:54.097
I understand why you did.

38:54.165 --> 38:57.157
I've been observing the crew
interacting with their families

38:57.234 --> 38:58.895
over the past few days.

38:59.070 --> 39:00.697
It's become clear to me

39:00.805 --> 39:02.830
how meaningful
that communication can be.

39:06.510 --> 39:09.638
Thanks, but I can't accept this.

39:09.714 --> 39:11.181
Why not?

39:11.248 --> 39:13.273
You should contact
your own family.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.819
My parents were assimilated.

39:15.886 --> 39:17.478
Well, there must be someone.

39:17.555 --> 39:19.386
A distant relative?

39:19.457 --> 39:22.392
My father has a sister
on Earth...

39:22.460 --> 39:24.155
Irene Hansen.

39:24.228 --> 39:27.994
I'm sure she'd be thrilled
to hear from you.

39:32.570 --> 39:34.333
You can imagine my reaction

39:34.438 --> 39:37.271
when Starfleet told me
to expect your call.

39:37.341 --> 39:40.799
I experienced
some apprehension myself.

39:40.911 --> 39:43.243
You seem like
a lovely young woman,

39:43.314 --> 39:48.513
but you were the most stubborn
six year old I've ever met.

39:48.586 --> 39:52.022
Your parents left you with me
for a weekend,

39:52.089 --> 39:53.215
and you were so angry,

39:53.290 --> 39:55.281
you locked yourself
in my guest room

39:55.359 --> 39:56.792
and refused to come out.

39:58.329 --> 40:01.264
That must have been...
inconvenient for you.

40:01.332 --> 40:04.062
Oh, I coaxed you out
eventually...

40:04.168 --> 40:05.795
with a strawberry tart.

40:05.903 --> 40:08.269
I'm very fond of strawberries.

40:08.339 --> 40:10.603
I didn't realize
I'd eaten them as a child.

40:10.674 --> 40:12.232
You couldn't get enough of them.

40:13.344 --> 40:15.312
Of course, you didn't hesitate
to point out

40:15.379 --> 40:16.937
if they weren't perfectly ripe.

40:17.014 --> 40:20.916
I'm sorry if I insulted you.

40:20.985 --> 40:24.944
Perhaps I shouldn't have called.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.182
No, I'm very glad you did.

40:27.258 --> 40:31.661
It's wonderful
to see you again, Annika.

40:38.369 --> 40:40.428
We're exploring
new territory today,

40:40.538 --> 40:41.835
so it is fitting
that this hearing

40:41.906 --> 40:43.965
is being held at Pathfinder.

40:44.074 --> 40:46.372
The Doctor exhibits
many of the traits

40:46.444 --> 40:48.173
we associate with a person--

40:48.245 --> 40:52.909
intelligence, creativity,
ambition, even fallibility--

40:52.983 --> 40:54.917
but are these traits real

40:54.985 --> 40:57.977
or is the Doctor merely
programmed to simulate them?

40:58.055 --> 41:01.889
To be honest, I don't know.

41:02.026 --> 41:04.494
Eventually,
we will have to decide,

41:04.562 --> 41:06.587
because the issue
of holographic rights

41:06.664 --> 41:08.632
isn't going to go away.

41:08.699 --> 41:11.327
But at this time,
I am not prepared to rule

41:11.435 --> 41:13.494
that the Doctor
is a person under the law.

41:13.604 --> 41:16.835
However, it is obvious he is

41:16.907 --> 41:19.876
no ordinary hologram,
and while I can't say

41:19.944 --> 41:21.502
with certainty
that he is a person,

41:21.579 --> 41:23.479
I am willing to extend
the legal definition

41:23.547 --> 41:25.242
of artist to include the Doctor.

41:25.316 --> 41:26.578
I therefore rule

41:26.650 --> 41:28.550
that he has the right
to control his work,

41:28.619 --> 41:29.950
and I'm ordering all copies

41:30.054 --> 41:32.181
of his holonovels
to be recalled immediately.

41:32.256 --> 41:33.348
Your Honor...

41:33.424 --> 41:34.652
This hearing is adjourned.

41:34.725 --> 41:35.885
Congratulations, Doctor.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.325
Thank you, Reg.

41:37.394 --> 41:38.986
We'll be in touch, Captain.

41:41.365 --> 41:42.730
You don't look like someone

41:42.800 --> 41:45.894
who's just struck the first blow
for the rights of holograms.

41:46.003 --> 41:47.595
I don't mean
to sound ungrateful,

41:47.705 --> 41:51.641
but it feels like a hollow
victory-- pardon the pun.

41:51.709 --> 41:54.507
The program's already been
played by thousands of people.

41:54.578 --> 41:55.510
The damage is done.

41:55.579 --> 41:56.568
We'll survive.

41:56.647 --> 41:57.807
If I'm not mistaken,

41:57.882 --> 42:00.043
don't you have a holonovel
to revise?

42:00.150 --> 42:02.880
Do you think I'll be able
to find another publisher?

42:02.920 --> 42:05.889
If there's one thing
I've learned about you, Doctor,

42:05.990 --> 42:07.355
it's that you can do
just about anything

42:07.424 --> 42:08.823
you set your mind to.

42:17.501 --> 42:19.765
Time for your diagnostic.

42:19.870 --> 42:21.895
Report to the Holo-Lab.

42:22.072 --> 42:23.664
I know the routine.

42:23.774 --> 42:29.508
And... while you're there,
do yourself a favor.

42:29.580 --> 42:33.346
Ask the operator
to run program 47-Beta.

42:33.417 --> 42:35.282
Why? What is it?

42:35.352 --> 42:38.219
It's called Photons Be Free.

42:38.289 --> 42:39.779
It's quite provocative.
