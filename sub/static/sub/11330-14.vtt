00:05.967 --> 00:09.136
She would have been
eight weeks old today.

00:09.170 --> 00:10.737
She was my daughter, too.

00:10.772 --> 00:12.072
I can find another place to stay.

00:16.010 --> 00:17.711
Why would you be
looking for another job?

00:17.745 --> 00:19.046
It's time to make a change in my life.

00:19.080 --> 00:20.881
I don't want to be married. Me neither.

00:20.915 --> 00:22.182
Apparently Camille is in love with you.

00:22.217 --> 00:23.917
That's why she quit. What?

00:23.952 --> 00:26.920
Don't you think it'd be
appropriate to tell your mothers...

00:26.955 --> 00:28.856
That you three were living together?

00:28.890 --> 00:30.023
You can't be in Florida already.

00:30.058 --> 00:31.792
We're at Toby's grandmother's house.

00:31.826 --> 00:32.960
Grace would never cheat on me.

00:32.994 --> 00:34.728
She's on a medical mission.
Who would she cheat with?

00:34.762 --> 00:36.063
Is Grace home? Are you Daniel?

00:36.097 --> 00:37.764
My dad's got you working for him today?

00:37.799 --> 00:39.032
Honored to be here.

00:39.067 --> 00:41.101
I broke up with Madison.
I'm still in love with you.

00:41.135 --> 00:44.037
You are not going to take
another drink again anytime soon.

00:49.944 --> 00:51.144
I take it you fell off the wagon?

00:51.179 --> 00:53.914
This is your last chance
to be involved in my life.

00:53.948 --> 00:55.115
I want to get pregnant again.

00:55.149 --> 00:56.717
What if you have a new plan?

00:56.751 --> 00:59.152
I would like you to move out.

00:59.187 --> 01:00.888
Adrian is still in love with Ricky.

01:00.922 --> 01:01.989
I feel a little relieved.

01:02.023 --> 01:03.857
Well, would you feel
relieved if we split up?

01:03.892 --> 01:06.660
Maybe I could rent
Ashley's room from you.

01:06.694 --> 01:08.095
Maybe I could live here.

01:08.129 --> 01:10.097
If I could get you a really, really
hot date, would you go out then?

01:10.131 --> 01:11.131
Who would I fix her up with?

01:11.165 --> 01:12.866
That guy upstairs.

01:12.901 --> 01:14.835
We've been together

01:14.869 --> 01:16.136
You are not breaking up
with me at school, are you?

01:16.170 --> 01:17.771
I know someone who lives upstairs.

01:17.805 --> 01:19.873
You're Adrian? And you are?

01:19.908 --> 01:21.942

01:43.932 --> 01:44.932

01:46.200 --> 01:48.001

the phone all afternoon,

maybe you have things to do.

Gotta go.

02:36.784 --> 02:37.918
Who was that?

02:39.120 --> 02:42.689
Just a guy I met. At the lake.

02:42.724 --> 02:44.024
How old is he?

02:44.058 --> 02:46.026
He'll be a senior. Uh-huh.

02:46.861 --> 02:48.695
And?

And he's the son of the Sausage King.

02:51.899 --> 02:54.801
Really? But you're a vegetarian.

02:54.836 --> 02:56.036
Well, at least for the past month,

02:56.070 --> 02:58.038
which I'm still not sure is healthy.

02:58.072 --> 03:00.707
Of course, it might be healthier
than eating sausage every day.

03:00.742 --> 03:03.744
Mom, would you stop that?

03:03.778 --> 03:06.647
He's cute and he's nice and he likes me.

03:06.681 --> 03:07.781
This could be it.

03:07.815 --> 03:09.850

03:28.903 --> 03:30.804
Well, that's an interesting name.

06:47.924 --> 06:50.525

we can just run off one

09:57.813 --> 09:58.980
Who is this?

09:59.015 --> 10:01.850
Who do you think it is? It's
Adrian! I'm looking for Omar.

10:01.884 --> 10:03.651
I blocked your calls.

10:03.686 --> 10:04.953
Yeah, I unblocked them from
your phone last night in the car.

10:04.987 --> 10:06.521
Where is he?

10:06.555 --> 10:07.789
I haven't seen him
since I dropped him off.

10:07.823 --> 10:09.657
And what time was that?

10:09.692 --> 10:13.561
Uh, I don't know and I don't know
that that's any of your business.

10:13.596 --> 10:15.964
Dropped him off where? He
lives upstairs from you.

10:15.998 --> 10:19.667
Again, I don't know that
that's any of your business.

10:19.702 --> 10:24.606
Daniel, please, please,
tell me where he is.

10:24.640 --> 10:27.842
Look, I've lost enough this
year. I can't lose him, too.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.912
I really care about him and
I want to apologize to him.

10:30.946 --> 10:34.682
Please find him for me, please.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.519
I'll see what I can do, Adrian.

10:37.553 --> 10:38.586
Thank you.

10:40.956 --> 10:41.956
Adrian.

10:42.925 --> 10:44.993
She's called me 27 times.

10:45.027 --> 10:46.728
(CHUCKLES) And?

10:46.762 --> 10:49.597
And I know she's trouble.

10:49.632 --> 10:52.534
But I'm attracted to
her in some crazy way,

10:52.568 --> 10:55.003
and I'd call her if...

10:55.037 --> 10:56.838
If she hadn't met my brother first.

10:56.872 --> 10:58.006
That wasn't bothering you before.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.874
Well, it's bothering me now.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.643
Why?

11:01.677 --> 11:04.679
Because I don't like
seeing her kiss another guy.

11:04.713 --> 11:06.714
We should have stayed at
that stupid party, man.

11:21.630 --> 11:24.933
Hi. Your mom let me in.

11:24.967 --> 11:27.902
Yeah, well my mom doesn't know
that you slept with my boyfriend.

11:29.638 --> 11:31.539
And my mom doesn't know that I hate you.

11:31.574 --> 11:32.574
Get out!

11:47.723 --> 11:48.723
Wake up. Huh?

11:49.992 --> 11:53.962
(GROANS) Oh. How are you?

11:53.996 --> 11:55.864
I'm not good. How are you?

11:55.898 --> 11:58.700
(SIGHS) I'm all right.

11:58.734 --> 12:00.502
You're all right? You're all right!

12:00.536 --> 12:01.903
Henry slept with your
wife and you're all right?

12:06.234 --> 12:06.234
+

12:07.548 --> 12:09.877
What happened?
He stood you up?

12:10.020 --> 12:11.954
Do you want me to have my dad go over
to his house and arrest him or something?

12:11.988 --> 12:14.957
'Cause he will. If I ask
him to, he definitely will.

12:16.091 --> 12:17.892
I don't know what I did wrong.

12:17.926 --> 12:19.327
We talked on the phone for hours.

12:19.361 --> 12:21.095
Oh. That could've been it.

12:21.130 --> 12:24.065
What? We found out we
have a lot in common.

12:24.099 --> 12:27.902
Well, maybe he just doesn't want to
go out with someone just like him.

12:28.203 --> 12:29.904
Yeah. Maybe.

12:29.938 --> 12:31.939
Well, you have to leave a
little mystery, you know.

12:31.974 --> 12:34.275
You can't just tell
him everything at once.

12:34.309 --> 12:39.013
But we were having such
a good time talking,

12:39.048 --> 12:41.249
and then he called and asked me out.

12:41.283 --> 12:44.352
And just a half-hour ago, he
called and said he couldn't make it.

12:44.386 --> 12:46.354
Maybe that girl that was there,

12:46.388 --> 12:48.189
that kind of trashy-looking girl...

12:48.223 --> 12:50.191
They all looked trashy. Which one?

12:50.225 --> 12:52.927
The only other girl he
was talking to all night.

12:52.961 --> 12:55.897
Oh. That's his ex-wife.

12:55.931 --> 12:58.366
Or she will be his ex-wife
when they get divorced.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.936
What? So, he's married
and he's getting a divorce,

13:01.970 --> 13:05.339
and he's still in high
school? Hello? Loser.

13:06.909 --> 13:10.211
DYLAN: Well, no, not a loser.

13:10.245 --> 13:13.147
Unfortunately, he just
got this girl pregnant.

13:13.182 --> 13:14.315
MERCEDES: He has a kid?

13:14.349 --> 13:17.318
No, they lost the baby.
The baby passed away.

13:19.354 --> 13:21.155
Get away from my door!

13:24.093 --> 13:25.259
The guy is married!

13:25.294 --> 13:27.095
(CHUCKLING) He can't be!

13:27.129 --> 13:29.130
He had to get married, and then
something happened with the baby.

13:29.164 --> 13:30.331
I didn't get that.

13:30.365 --> 13:32.166
No, whoa, I think you've heard enough.

13:33.902 --> 13:35.269
Come on.

13:35.304 --> 13:38.306
He didn't want to be married
to her in the first place, so...

13:38.340 --> 13:41.342
Still, I mean, maybe you should just

13:41.376 --> 13:43.144
stick to guys at our school.

13:43.178 --> 13:45.146
But we're not in school all summer.

13:45.180 --> 13:47.081
I wanted to meet a guy this summer.

13:47.116 --> 13:50.184
And I did. I want Ben Boykewich.

13:50.219 --> 13:52.053
Even knowing all this?

13:52.087 --> 13:53.387
Yes.

13:53.422 --> 13:57.325
Well, if you want him, you
should have him. Let's go get him.

13:57.359 --> 14:00.962
Yeah, let's just go get him. What?

14:00.996 --> 14:02.964
When you were talking to him,
did you find out where he lived?

14:02.998 --> 14:06.100
Kind of. He kind of said
where he lived, and then

14:06.135 --> 14:07.869
I found it on the Internet.

14:08.871 --> 14:10.138
It's a nice house.

14:10.172 --> 14:11.305
Okay, we can't just go get him.

14:11.340 --> 14:12.874
Yes, we can.

14:12.908 --> 14:13.975
Can we?

14:14.009 --> 14:15.276
Yeah, we can if we want.

14:15.310 --> 14:18.179
Okay, well, should we just go
get Daniel for you, as well?

14:18.914 --> 14:20.281
Ouch.

14:20.315 --> 14:23.084
I can get Daniel without having
to go and get Daniel, okay?

14:23.118 --> 14:25.086
All I have to do is forward a picture.

14:28.290 --> 14:29.290
Who's that?

14:34.263 --> 14:36.197
I'm sorry, who is this?

14:36.231 --> 14:40.134
Geez, it's me, Madison, and
you better learn who I am

14:40.169 --> 14:42.303
'cause I am possibly your only friend.

14:42.337 --> 14:44.305
Madison, of Lauren and Madison?

14:44.339 --> 14:46.140
Isn't Lauren your friend? And Amy?

14:46.175 --> 14:49.177
Lauren was my friend. And
Amy was my friend, too.

14:49.211 --> 14:50.311
Until I slept with Jesse.

14:50.345 --> 14:51.345
Who's that?

14:51.380 --> 14:53.347
Uh, Jesse. Lauren's boyfriend.

14:53.382 --> 14:55.883
Oh, yeah, the guy throwing the party.

14:55.918 --> 14:59.320
Yeah, the guy throwing the
party, and Lauren's boyfriend.

14:59.354 --> 15:00.888
So, you called me because...

15:00.923 --> 15:02.857
Because I slept with Jesse last night,

15:02.891 --> 15:04.058
and you slept with Adrian...

15:04.092 --> 15:05.092
(EXCLAIMS)

15:07.196 --> 15:09.897
People know? Does everyone know?

15:09.932 --> 15:11.199
I thought maybe only Alice knew.

15:11.233 --> 15:14.168
Uh, no, everyone knows. Are you kidding?

15:14.203 --> 15:16.204
And now, now we are outcasts.

15:16.905 --> 15:18.873
Oh, God.

15:18.907 --> 15:21.976
Which is why I was considering if maybe
you would like to sign up for summer school.

15:22.010 --> 15:24.245
What? No way. Adrian
is in summer school.

15:24.279 --> 15:27.982
So am I. I mean, I was
supposed to go with Lauren.

15:28.016 --> 15:30.885
But, you know, now
she's going to be there,

15:30.919 --> 15:32.820
and I cannot just go in
there alone, you know.

15:32.855 --> 15:36.224
I can't. I need a friend.
I have to have a friend.

15:36.258 --> 15:38.092
Someone. Anyone.

15:39.194 --> 15:40.194
Thanks.

15:41.296 --> 15:42.997
I just want to talk to him.

15:43.031 --> 15:44.966
Adrian, this is so not like you,

15:45.000 --> 15:46.367
to beg a guy to go out with you.

15:46.401 --> 15:49.070
Oh, well, it is so like you to
be going out with Jack and Daniel

15:49.104 --> 15:50.938
at the same time, but criticizing me.

15:50.973 --> 15:53.274
You're no better than I am.
You're too fickle, you know that?

15:53.308 --> 15:55.176
No, I'm not. I'm not fickle.

15:55.210 --> 15:58.212
And I'm not going out with Jack and
Daniel at the same time. I just...

16:00.082 --> 16:02.083
I just kissed Jack.

16:02.117 --> 16:06.020
I just kissed him again. I
don't know why I did that.

16:06.054 --> 16:08.055
Why did I do that? What am I doing?

16:08.090 --> 16:10.758
I don't know. What am I doing?

16:10.792 --> 16:12.760
What, are you doing something?

16:12.794 --> 16:14.195
(SIGHS) I did something.

16:14.229 --> 16:15.930
What did you do?

16:15.964 --> 16:17.999
You don't know? I don't know.

16:18.033 --> 16:19.166
Oh, I hope Ben doesn't know.

16:20.903 --> 16:23.037
I think I may have reached rock bottom.

16:23.071 --> 16:25.139
Yeah, me too. I mean, me.

16:26.975 --> 16:28.109
I love Daniel, but...

16:29.244 --> 16:31.979
I kind of maybe still love Jack.

16:32.014 --> 16:34.849
I slept with Henry. Henry? Henry who?

16:34.883 --> 16:36.017
Of Henry and Alice?

16:38.053 --> 16:39.954
Yeah, I know. I know.

16:47.963 --> 16:49.096
I know what this is about.

16:49.131 --> 16:51.198
You had hours to say
something to me, Henry!

16:51.233 --> 16:54.268
Hours! I had to find out that you
slept with Adrian through Alice!

16:54.303 --> 16:56.003
Ben, I'm sorry.

16:56.038 --> 16:57.905
I would never have even
approached her. You know that.

16:57.940 --> 16:59.774
She's my wife!

16:59.808 --> 17:02.176
Well, ex-wife, or about to be.

17:02.210 --> 17:04.845
Not that that makes any difference.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.714
It was a betrayal on
a level I didn't think

17:06.748 --> 17:09.951
I was capable of, t it wasn't my fault.

17:09.984 --> 17:12.185
Oh, dear God. You're not
going to go there, are you?

17:12.220 --> 17:14.155
You're not going to blame
her for seducing you.

17:15.790 --> 17:17.959
She did not seduce me or you!

17:17.992 --> 17:19.026
Yes, she did!

17:19.060 --> 17:20.828
No, she did not.

17:20.862 --> 17:22.829
She is not to blame for what
happened in that car that night.

17:22.864 --> 17:24.999
I'm as guilty as she is
of betraying Amy and Ricky

17:25.032 --> 17:26.800
and getting pregnant as a result.

17:26.835 --> 17:28.035
You'd like to think so, I'm sure, but...

17:28.069 --> 17:30.037
What? She just...

17:30.072 --> 17:34.108
I didn't even... You were with
that girl, that other girl.

17:34.142 --> 17:35.977
Not that that's any excuse.

17:36.011 --> 17:39.113
It's just that she
felt rejected by Ricky,

17:39.147 --> 17:41.215
and then by that other
guy and then by you,

17:41.249 --> 17:42.984
and she didn't have anyone to turn to,

17:43.018 --> 17:45.052
and I guess I just felt sorry for her.

17:45.087 --> 17:46.821
And we went into that bedroom to talk,

17:46.855 --> 17:49.023
and it was late and
we were just talking...

17:50.058 --> 17:51.225
And then, we were not talking...

17:51.259 --> 17:55.196
And Ben, I am so sorry.
I am deeply sorry.

17:55.230 --> 17:57.064
I'm ashamed of myself.

17:57.099 --> 18:01.102
We've known each other since the
third grade. You're my closest friend.

18:01.136 --> 18:02.970
Or you were.

18:03.005 --> 18:05.106
I know I deserve this, Ben, but...

18:05.140 --> 18:08.709
Don't ever come over to
this house again, Henry.

18:08.744 --> 18:09.944
You're no longer welcome here.

18:28.130 --> 18:30.765
MERCEDES: Go on! RAVEN: Get up there!

18:30.799 --> 18:32.833
WENDY: Mmm-hmm. Ask him.

18:32.868 --> 18:36.037
Hi. I'm sorry to just show up like this,

18:36.071 --> 18:38.906
but, um, my friends were wondering...

18:39.875 --> 18:41.108
Why'd you break our date?

18:46.992 --> 18:46.992
+

18:15.254 --> 18:18.390
<i>Because when a screen
becomes this good...</i>

18:51.290 --> 18:52.390
just showing off in front of the class?

18:52.425 --> 18:54.292
You're not really going to marry her?

18:54.326 --> 18:57.061
What? No. Not me. It's not me.

18:57.096 --> 18:59.330
Dad, what a terrible thing
to say to my future husband.

18:59.365 --> 19:01.199
I think that's what he's getting at.

19:01.233 --> 19:04.335
"Future." How far into
the future, do you think?

19:04.370 --> 19:06.104
Would you two calm down?

19:06.138 --> 19:07.505
Why should they be in such a hurry?

19:07.540 --> 19:11.009
Hurry? You call waiting two years
after the baby is born a hurry?

19:11.043 --> 19:12.277
Good one. Thank you.

19:12.311 --> 19:14.012
They don't have to get married at all.

19:14.046 --> 19:17.048
Okay, okay, I said yes,
okay? I want to get married.

19:17.082 --> 19:18.450
I just don't want to spend
my senior year of high school

19:18.484 --> 19:19.484
making wedding plans.

19:22.154 --> 19:24.088
I wanna make sure I get
into a good college, too.

19:24.123 --> 19:25.190
For what? He's the man.

19:25.224 --> 19:26.324
He got into college.
You don't have to go.

19:26.358 --> 19:28.059
(BOTH LAUGH)

19:28.093 --> 19:29.360
Oh, great. She thinks he's funny.

19:29.395 --> 19:31.162
You don't think George is funny?

19:31.197 --> 19:33.431
I mean, it took me a while to
get used to his sense of humor,

19:33.466 --> 19:35.200
but come on. He's funny.

19:35.234 --> 19:36.468
He's not that funny.

19:36.502 --> 19:39.237
Okay, well, maybe we'll just
wake John up and take him.

19:39.271 --> 19:41.339
It's almost his bedtime
and he's still napping.

19:41.373 --> 19:44.108
If you wake him up now, he's
going to be in a bad mood.

19:44.143 --> 19:45.410
A worse mood than you?

19:45.444 --> 19:48.313
I'm not in a bad mood.

19:48.347 --> 19:52.217
Okay, I'm really starting to hate
this arrangement. You know that?

19:52.251 --> 19:55.320
I think somebody regrets
sleeping with somebody else.

19:55.354 --> 19:57.121
You told her that?

19:57.156 --> 19:58.523
I think I'll just go to my room.

19:58.557 --> 20:01.059
Yeah, go to your room, young lady.

20:01.093 --> 20:03.495
You know, George, I didn't object
to Ricky's mother living here,

20:03.529 --> 20:05.096
but now I do.

20:06.165 --> 20:08.132
Wait. Do you want to live here?

20:08.167 --> 20:11.135
I know I don't even want to stay
here another five minutes. Amy?

20:11.170 --> 20:12.203
You think it's gonna be any better

20:12.238 --> 20:13.338
when we go over to your parents' house?

20:13.372 --> 20:15.039
With Margaret and Shakur?

20:15.074 --> 20:16.174
Yes, with Margaret and Shakur.

20:16.442 --> 20:18.042
Yeah. I do.

20:18.077 --> 20:20.078
So your parents are
better than Amy's parents?

20:20.112 --> 20:21.479
My parents are even
better than my parents.

20:21.514 --> 20:24.449
Your parents... Never mind.

20:24.483 --> 20:26.451
How did this even happen?

20:26.485 --> 20:30.255
We just wanted to come pick up John,
and kind of celebrate getting engaged.

20:30.289 --> 20:32.190
Engaged means you're getting married.

20:32.224 --> 20:33.558
I just told her that this afternoon.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.160
I did.

20:36.195 --> 20:39.097
Okay, listen to me.
Everyone. Yeah, everyone.

20:39.131 --> 20:40.532
I am thrilled to be engaged to Ricky.

20:40.566 --> 20:44.202
It's what I've wanted
for a long time now.

20:44.236 --> 20:47.405
But I just want some
time to enjoy it, okay?

20:47.439 --> 20:49.207
When we get married,
hopefully we'll be married

20:49.241 --> 20:51.476
for the rest of our lives, no offense.

20:51.510 --> 20:53.077
None taken.

20:53.112 --> 20:54.245
None taken.

20:54.280 --> 20:55.547
So, we've got plenty of time.

20:55.581 --> 20:57.248
A long engagement is never good.

20:58.384 --> 21:00.018
It's not.

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

21:01.253 --> 21:03.254
Oh, thank God. It's Lauren.

21:07.192 --> 21:08.459
I'm as surprised as you are.

21:08.494 --> 21:10.328
I thought she'd want to
get married next week.

21:11.430 --> 21:12.463
Maybe you should talk to her.

21:12.498 --> 21:14.065
What, about getting married

21:14.099 --> 21:15.400
her senior year of high school?

21:17.403 --> 21:19.404
It's a nice night. I'll just be outside.

21:19.438 --> 21:21.272
Or somewhere other than here.

21:23.208 --> 21:24.208
(SIGHS)

21:27.112 --> 21:29.347
How did we screw up so badly?

21:29.381 --> 21:32.483
How did we take a marriage
and three lovely children,

21:32.518 --> 21:36.154
and turn it into a divorce
and living apart, and...

21:36.188 --> 21:38.189
This is not how things
are supposed to be!

21:39.425 --> 21:42.527
This is not how I saw
my life turning out!

21:42.561 --> 21:45.530
As a divorced mother of three
arguing with her ex-husband

21:45.564 --> 21:48.399
on a Saturday night about
when our teenage daughter

21:48.434 --> 21:50.435
should marry the father of her baby.

21:50.469 --> 21:54.105
Anne, there's nothing
wrong with this life.

21:54.139 --> 21:55.340
It's just life.

21:55.374 --> 21:59.310
Well, it's not the life
that I want. It's really not.

22:02.314 --> 22:06.050
And I don't know what
I'm gonna do, but...

22:06.085 --> 22:07.251
I'm gonna make some changes.

22:07.286 --> 22:08.419
Any changes that include me?

22:11.023 --> 22:12.123
I think I hear Robie.

22:14.393 --> 22:15.393
(SIGHS)

22:26.372 --> 22:28.072
Nice room.

22:28.107 --> 22:30.274
I think you've seen it before.

22:30.309 --> 22:32.043
Don't remind me of my mistakes

22:32.077 --> 22:34.012
and I won't remind you
of yours, all right?

22:34.046 --> 22:38.149
Deal. How are you?

22:38.183 --> 22:42.220
I'm fine. Little tired of
waiting around for John to get up.

22:42.254 --> 22:44.122
What time did he go down for his nap?

22:44.156 --> 22:46.290
Mmm, beats me. I don't know. 5:00?

22:46.325 --> 22:47.492
(SCOFFS)

22:47.526 --> 22:49.260
I hate it when he gets off his schedule,

22:49.294 --> 22:52.063
when other people let
him get off his schedule.

22:52.097 --> 22:53.264
It wasn't me.

22:55.167 --> 22:58.069
And I can't believe I'm hearing
those words come out of your mouth.

22:59.138 --> 23:00.471
Why not? I'm his dad.

23:00.506 --> 23:03.374
I know, I know. I didn't mean
it in a bad way. I just meant...

23:05.344 --> 23:09.013
I can't believe you turned out to be

23:09.048 --> 23:13.151
such a beautiful person after
all the hell I put you through.

23:15.087 --> 23:16.220
Me neither.

23:22.428 --> 23:25.096
That was one beautiful proposal.

23:27.166 --> 23:30.334
Too bad it's not ending in
a marriage. What's going on?

23:30.369 --> 23:34.105
I don't know. I think she's
just really happy with the ring.

23:34.139 --> 23:35.339
I guess, that's all right, isn't it?

23:35.374 --> 23:39.110
Yeah, sure, it is. I mean...

23:39.144 --> 23:42.113
You get married, you get
married, you don't, you don't.

23:42.147 --> 23:45.083
No, I asked her because
I want to get married.

23:45.117 --> 23:46.184
I want to get married.

23:48.520 --> 23:51.022
Someone's looking for you.

23:51.056 --> 23:53.057
John! Gotta go.

23:57.096 --> 23:59.197
Hi, sweetie, how are you?

24:01.100 --> 24:03.301
Look. Look.

24:03.335 --> 24:06.437
Mommy got her ring! You told me
I would get a ring, didn't you?

24:08.273 --> 24:12.143
He kept pointing to my hand,
saying, "Ring." He's so cute.

24:12.177 --> 24:16.414
John, wanna go play with
your toys? Here you go.

24:16.448 --> 24:20.084
Amy, don't let Ricky or
your father pressure you

24:20.119 --> 24:24.088
into having a wedding until
you're sure you want a wedding.

24:24.123 --> 24:25.423
Really sure you want a wedding.

24:25.457 --> 24:27.425
Mom, I wanna get married.

24:27.459 --> 24:30.128
I love Ricky, and I want to spend
the rest of my life with him,

24:30.162 --> 24:33.164
but there are still other
things that I want to do.

24:33.198 --> 24:35.399
I mean, I want to finish
high school and go to college,

24:35.434 --> 24:38.202
get my masters and teach,

24:38.237 --> 24:41.272
and along the way, maybe offer
my experience as a teenage mother

24:41.306 --> 24:44.242
in a way that would make a
contribution to other teenage mothers.

24:44.276 --> 24:46.144
I want to be married.

24:46.178 --> 24:49.347
John and Ricky are two of the most
important people in my life, but...

24:49.381 --> 24:52.083
I honestly don't know how you
top that graduation proposal.

24:52.117 --> 24:54.085
That was better than any
wedding could ever be.

24:54.119 --> 24:55.486
But it doesn't mean the same thing.

24:55.521 --> 24:58.022
An engagement is not a marriage.

24:58.056 --> 24:59.991
Geez, does everyone
just think I'm stupid?

25:00.025 --> 25:03.027
No, everyone just thinks you
don't want to get married.

25:03.061 --> 25:05.096
That's crazy! Of course I want to.

25:05.130 --> 25:06.364
I just don't know when.

25:06.398 --> 25:09.233
And I don't feel as if I have
to decide when right away.

25:09.268 --> 25:12.003
My life could not get
any better than this, Mom.

25:13.238 --> 25:14.338
I mean, I got what I wanted.

25:14.373 --> 25:16.974
I'm happier than I ever knew I could be.

25:17.009 --> 25:20.144
And I don't feel that it
could be taken away from me.

25:20.179 --> 25:22.980
I mean, I waited for
this. I earned this.

25:23.015 --> 25:25.449
This is like a badge
of honor, this ring.

25:27.019 --> 25:28.152
And...

25:29.454 --> 25:33.090
I don't just love Ricky and John.

25:33.125 --> 25:34.325
I love myself.

25:35.227 --> 25:36.460
(SIGHS)

25:36.495 --> 25:41.432
That's what I want. That
feeling, I want that.

Then you should have that. Get that.

25:46.205 --> 25:47.205
Get what?

25:48.373 --> 25:51.142
Ashley! Oh!

25:51.176 --> 25:53.211
It's so good to see you!

25:53.245 --> 25:55.079
Why didn't you let us
know you were coming?

25:55.113 --> 25:57.481
We didn't really know. We
just started driving last week,

25:57.516 --> 26:00.051
and well, here we are.

26:00.085 --> 26:02.220
I wish you had been
here for the graduation.

26:02.254 --> 26:04.121
Ashley, Ricky proposed to me.

26:04.156 --> 26:07.024
He called me up on the stage and he
proposed to me in front of everyone.

26:07.059 --> 26:09.360
Really? How embarrassing.

26:09.394 --> 26:11.062
Ashley.

26:11.997 --> 26:14.065
Guess what? I got into college.

26:14.099 --> 26:15.433
Yeah, I was a year
behind Amy in high school,

26:15.467 --> 26:17.168
but I'll be a year ahead in college.

26:17.202 --> 26:19.103
Wait, you got into college? I did.

26:19.137 --> 26:21.339
Toby and I both did. In Florida.

26:21.373 --> 26:25.042
Oh. So, it's not Oxford.
It's clown college.

26:25.077 --> 26:26.310
Shut up. You shut up.

26:26.345 --> 26:29.113
Hey, what's going on?

26:29.147 --> 26:31.115
I didn't know you
were back. How are you?

26:32.150 --> 26:33.417
Dad rented out your room, you know.

26:48.186 --> 26:49.253
This is his room!

26:50.289 --> 26:52.056
Wow.

26:52.090 --> 26:53.291
Yeah, we could do something with this.

26:56.061 --> 26:57.895
I like my room.

26:57.930 --> 27:00.932
It's kind of plain compared to the
rest of the house, don't you think?

27:00.966 --> 27:05.102
I guess, but it's been
like this for years.

27:05.137 --> 27:08.005
It's been like this? For years?

27:08.040 --> 27:09.273
And you like it like this?

27:09.308 --> 27:11.175
Hey, be nice. He's new to us.

27:11.209 --> 27:13.277
Yeah, be nice.

27:13.312 --> 27:17.181
Well, I mean, it kind of looks like
a place that people might hang out in

27:17.215 --> 27:20.184
and smoke pot or something. Mmm-hmm.

27:20.218 --> 27:25.323
No, no, no, no. I guarantee you
no pot has been smoked in here.

27:25.357 --> 27:27.158
Would you like to smoke pot in here?

27:28.260 --> 27:29.360
I don't smoke pot.

27:29.394 --> 27:32.964
Really? Ever tried it?

27:32.998 --> 27:34.131
No, never have.

27:36.902 --> 27:39.070
Why? Do you want to smoke pot in here?

27:40.906 --> 27:43.207
I don't smoke. Not only is it illegal,

27:43.241 --> 27:45.843
but I don't like to
alter my mind that way.

27:45.877 --> 27:47.078
Don't let them pressure you.

27:47.112 --> 27:48.346
If you don't want to smoke,
you don't have to smoke.

27:50.015 --> 27:52.850
I don't want to smoke.

27:55.053 --> 27:56.854
Do you mind if we smoke?

27:56.888 --> 27:57.888
You smoke pot?

27:58.957 --> 28:00.291
Well, not really, no.

28:01.994 --> 28:03.861
Sometimes.

28:03.895 --> 28:07.965
Huh. All that conversation and you
never mentioned that you smoke pot.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.266
Okay, do you mind, or don't you?

28:10.068 --> 28:12.069
I...

28:12.104 --> 28:15.139
I don't mind. Yeah. Go ahead.

What will only take a minute?
I thought we were going out.

28:35.961 --> 28:37.862
I don't really feel like going out.

28:43.935 --> 28:45.870

28:49.107 --> 28:52.176
Oh. It's a text message with an
attachment from your old girlfriend.

28:52.210 --> 28:54.145
And it's you and your old boyfriend.

28:54.179 --> 28:55.813
Yeah, it is.

28:56.915 --> 28:57.982
The morning after you left me

28:58.016 --> 28:59.150
at an all-night party all by myself.

29:00.952 --> 29:04.288
But I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have stayed without you, and...

29:05.924 --> 29:08.993
I shouldn't have done
this. I'm sorry I did it.

29:09.027 --> 29:10.261
And I just want you to
know that this is all I did.

29:10.295 --> 29:12.129
I didn't do more than that.

29:12.164 --> 29:14.899
And I'm really sorry, Daniel.

29:14.933 --> 29:16.801
Are you? Of course I am.

29:16.835 --> 29:18.803
You sure this didn't follow
a long night together?

29:18.837 --> 29:20.871
No. It didn't.

29:20.906 --> 29:22.873
And why is your old
girlfriend sending you that?

29:22.908 --> 29:25.209
What is she, like, the kissing police?

29:25.243 --> 29:26.944
All I did was kiss him.

29:26.978 --> 29:29.914
No, no that's not all you did.

29:29.948 --> 29:31.849
You gave me a reason to
never trust you again.

29:31.883 --> 29:34.985
And you gave me the feeling
that you don't care about me.

29:35.020 --> 29:39.190
You care about Jack. You
still care about Jack.

29:39.224 --> 29:40.257
I didn't give you any of that.

29:40.292 --> 29:42.059
Your old girlfriend gave you that.

29:42.094 --> 29:43.127
And when she texted you that picture,

29:43.161 --> 29:45.229
that's exactly what she wanted to do.

29:45.263 --> 29:47.098
To make it so you never trust me again.

29:47.132 --> 29:49.100
So, you know what, forget it.

29:49.134 --> 29:51.068
Go back to your old girlfriend
if that's what you want to do.

29:51.103 --> 29:53.104
That's not what I want to do.

29:54.239 --> 29:55.239
But I don't want to be with you, either.

30:04.182 --> 30:05.182
Well, I hope you're happy.

30:05.217 --> 30:06.884
I hope you and Jack are really happy,

30:06.918 --> 30:08.919
because Daniel just broke up with me.

30:08.954 --> 30:11.222
Oh, honey, that doesn't make me happy.

30:11.256 --> 30:14.225
I like Daniel. I like him.

30:14.259 --> 30:15.926
Or at least I thought I did.

30:15.961 --> 30:16.961
He just broke up with you?

30:16.995 --> 30:18.262
Yeah. Just now.

30:18.296 --> 30:19.897
He came over here. I
thought we were going out,

30:19.931 --> 30:21.065
and then he just broke up with me.

30:21.099 --> 30:22.933
But why? Why would he do that?

30:22.968 --> 30:24.268
Because his stupid ex-girlfriend

30:24.302 --> 30:26.303
sent him a photo of me and
Jack kissing at that party.

30:26.338 --> 30:28.172
I can't believe you let me go to that!

30:28.206 --> 30:29.974
What are you, crazy? I'm 17!

30:30.008 --> 30:32.076
Mom, I should not be allowed
to go to all-night parties,

30:32.110 --> 30:34.111
especially when there are seniors there!

30:34.146 --> 30:37.181
You know, if Dad was alive, he never
would have let this happen, so...

30:37.215 --> 30:38.983
I'm going to Adrian's.

30:44.990 --> 30:46.957
So, did I hear yelling?

30:46.992 --> 30:50.027
Uh, yeah. And maybe Grace
would want to tell you

30:50.061 --> 30:51.195
what all that yelling was about.

30:51.229 --> 30:52.863
Daniel broke up with her.

30:52.898 --> 30:54.965
Yeah, and that does not mean
she'll go back with you, Jack.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.134
If anything, it may mean
she'll just blame you.

30:57.169 --> 30:58.936
But she already blamed you.

30:58.970 --> 31:00.871
That could change.

31:00.906 --> 31:03.140
Jack, just because Daniel and
Grace had this big argument,

31:03.175 --> 31:05.142
it doesn't mean they're broken up.

31:05.177 --> 31:08.078
I mean, sometimes jealousy can
make people cling to each other.

31:08.113 --> 31:09.980
Even when they shouldn't.

31:10.015 --> 31:11.949
Are you talking about me?

31:11.983 --> 31:14.985
It's just that you're
going to college, Jack,

31:15.020 --> 31:16.854
and you're going to be
playing football in college.

31:16.888 --> 31:19.857
And it's all going to
be new and exciting.

31:19.891 --> 31:21.926
And it's a great opportunity
for you to get a fresh start

31:21.960 --> 31:27.331
in your education, in your athletic
goals and your personal life.

31:27.365 --> 31:31.235
Jack, there's gonna be a lot of girls
at college that you've never met before.

31:31.269 --> 31:34.905
So, I don't know. Maybe, just maybe,

31:34.940 --> 31:37.274
it's time for you and Grace
to really just be friends.

31:43.048 --> 31:46.050
I'm so happy you came over here.
I hate being here by myself.

31:46.084 --> 31:47.151
He broke up with me.

31:49.854 --> 31:54.258
Okay, you have to remember
that phones have cameras.

31:54.292 --> 31:56.260
Hello! Cameras are everywhere.

31:56.294 --> 31:58.095
Well, that didn't bother you
when you were sleeping with Henry.

31:58.129 --> 32:00.231
Uh, I'm pretty sure that no
one took any pictures of that.

32:00.265 --> 32:02.933
How do you know? I mean,
maybe his old ex-girlfriend

32:02.968 --> 32:04.168
that was at that party,
maybe she took photos

32:04.202 --> 32:05.836
of everyone and sent them out.

32:05.870 --> 32:07.071
Wait, which one was she?

32:07.105 --> 32:08.939
That trashy-looking one.

32:08.974 --> 32:11.041
They all looked trashy. All those girls.

32:11.076 --> 32:13.944
Yeah, they are trashy. And
it's trashy to take a photo

32:13.979 --> 32:15.079
of the girl that your
old boyfriend is dating

32:15.113 --> 32:16.947
when that girl's kissing
her old boyfriend.

32:17.349 --> 32:18.983
Sit down.

32:23.188 --> 32:25.122
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

32:25.156 --> 32:26.857
I missed a phone call
when I was letting you in!

32:26.891 --> 32:27.891
Sorry.

32:27.926 --> 32:29.326
It's him! It's him!

32:29.361 --> 32:32.329
Oh, my God, it's not him. It's
his brother! It's Dante! (SCREAMS)

32:32.364 --> 32:35.799
So, you going to go out with his brother
now that Omar won't go out with you?

32:35.834 --> 32:37.101
I don't know. What's
the right thing to do?

32:37.135 --> 32:39.036
What? No, seriously, what
is the right thing to do?

32:39.070 --> 32:40.804
I don't know. (PHONE CHIMES)

32:40.839 --> 32:42.906
He's here. Quick!

32:42.941 --> 32:44.241
Give me an answer! Should
I go out with the brother,

32:44.276 --> 32:45.976
or should I tell him the truth?

32:46.011 --> 32:47.144
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

32:47.178 --> 32:49.013
Coming!

32:49.047 --> 32:50.080
Tell him the truth.

32:54.152 --> 32:55.953
Hey. Hey.

32:55.987 --> 32:56.987
Come in.

32:57.322 --> 32:59.156
All right.

32:59.190 --> 33:01.125
Hey, I'm just gonna be back there.

33:01.159 --> 33:02.293
I didn't know you were dropping by,

33:02.327 --> 33:04.094
but it's really nice to see you again.

33:06.097 --> 33:08.265
What about you? Is it really
good for you to see me again?

33:08.300 --> 33:13.170
(HESITANTLY) Yeah. It, um, is
really good for me to see you again,

33:13.204 --> 33:16.907
but I have to tell you something.

33:16.941 --> 33:18.042
Have you been home yet?

33:18.076 --> 33:20.044
No, I mean, I picked
up all your messages

33:20.078 --> 33:22.846
on the way back from the airport,
then I came straight here.

33:22.881 --> 33:25.316
Look, I'm sorry, okay.

33:25.350 --> 33:27.284
Look, I should've told you
that I was leaving the country.

33:27.319 --> 33:29.086
I went out with your
brother while you were gone,

33:29.120 --> 33:30.888
but now he hates me but
I still care about him.

33:33.513 --> 33:33.513
+

33:33.798 --> 33:36.293
It was just
a temporary solution, my staying here.

33:36.694 --> 33:39.963
Well, you can have it. I'm
leaving. I don't live here anymore.

33:39.997 --> 33:43.900
Ashley, Nora can stay in my room.

33:43.935 --> 33:45.735
I really don't live here anymore.

33:45.770 --> 33:48.839
No, your room seems to have
a curse on it or something.

33:48.873 --> 33:51.775
How can you say that? All
my dreams just came true.

33:51.809 --> 33:53.844
Oh, you always dreamed of
having a baby in high school?

33:53.878 --> 33:55.812
And then having to
marry the baby's father?

33:55.847 --> 33:57.814
Well, I guess dreams do come true.

33:59.016 --> 34:00.617
Well, um...

34:01.686 --> 34:04.054
Okay, I'll just be somewhere else.

34:11.027 --> 34:12.795
We haven't missed you, you know.

34:12.830 --> 34:13.897
Not one minute.

34:13.931 --> 34:15.998
You think you're better
than everyone else.

34:16.033 --> 34:19.902
But I am better than a lot
of people. You, for example.

34:19.937 --> 34:21.905
I thought that maybe your
trip would teach you something.

34:21.938 --> 34:24.674
Well, even if it didn't, I'd
still be smarter than you.

34:24.708 --> 34:25.708
(SCOFFS)

34:28.112 --> 34:29.913
It's too late for you to leave.

34:29.947 --> 34:33.717
It's never too late for me
to leave. And I already left.

34:33.751 --> 34:35.985
I meant it's too late for you
to be driving with our son.

34:36.020 --> 34:38.655
I know what you meant.

34:38.688 --> 34:41.824
Say goodnight to the people
who laid that egg in there.

34:41.859 --> 34:43.793
Good night. Good night.

34:43.828 --> 34:45.562
Good night, John.

34:45.596 --> 34:47.731
It's just been a very emotional weekend.

34:47.764 --> 34:50.567
Thank you for keeping John. Good night.

34:50.601 --> 34:51.902
Yeah, good night.

34:56.641 --> 34:57.641
Good night.

34:58.843 --> 34:59.843
See ya.

35:00.978 --> 35:02.012
(SIGHS)

35:08.653 --> 35:10.754
Damn. I lost my mojo.

35:10.788 --> 35:14.624
Sweet girl, that Ashley.
I'll just be going.

35:14.659 --> 35:18.962
Wait. You don't have any
place to go anand neither do I.

35:18.996 --> 35:20.931
I know. Rummy?

35:21.999 --> 35:23.066
I'll rummy you.

35:26.671 --> 35:27.671
Sweet.

35:29.040 --> 35:30.807
Thanks, Grace.

35:30.841 --> 35:34.578
You know, telling the truth
doesn't always work out.

35:34.612 --> 35:37.881
I knew in my heart that the
right thing to do is to lie.

35:38.716 --> 35:39.783
I'm sorry.

35:41.819 --> 35:44.788
I just want to get through summer
school and start a new life.

35:46.023 --> 35:47.824
I wish I was going to summer school

35:47.858 --> 35:49.893
and then off to college,
and then start a new life

35:49.927 --> 35:51.962
instead of going to the
same stupid med camp.

35:53.698 --> 35:55.999
What if you don't go to med camp?

35:56.033 --> 35:58.969
'Cause I have a great idea.

35:59.003 --> 36:02.005
What if you go to summer school with me?

36:02.039 --> 36:04.741
What? Why would I go to summer school?

36:04.775 --> 36:06.643
Why not?

36:06.677 --> 36:07.711
You could take a couple
of courses and get ahead,

36:07.745 --> 36:09.012
and have a really easy senior year,

36:09.046 --> 36:10.947
maybe improve your grade point average.

36:10.982 --> 36:13.917
My grade point average
is pretty darn good.

36:13.951 --> 36:17.554
Is pretty darn good going
to get you into med school?

36:17.588 --> 36:19.022
Well, to tell you the truth,
I really don't want to spend

36:19.056 --> 36:20.991
another summer in med camp.

36:21.025 --> 36:25.629
I mean, another summer of
unair-conditioned dorm rooms, and bad food,

36:25.663 --> 36:27.731
and sneaking around trying to...

36:27.765 --> 36:30.567
Oh, that's right, I won't be
sneaking around trying to see Grant.

36:30.601 --> 36:32.736
I don't want to see Grant.

36:32.770 --> 36:35.705
I would be seeing a lot of Grant.

36:35.740 --> 36:37.907
Maybe you're onto something.
Maybe I should ask my mom.

36:37.942 --> 36:42.545
Do it! Ask her. Oh, you
know what else you should do?

36:42.580 --> 36:44.547
Ask her if you can live
with me this summer!

36:44.549 --> 36:45.882
We can keep each other out of trouble.

36:45.916 --> 36:49.886
And I have an extra bedroom.n
You can have Ben's room.!

36:49.920 --> 36:52.622
I don't think she's gonna
let me live with you.

36:52.657 --> 36:53.957
Okay, what if I asked her?

36:53.991 --> 36:58.528
What if I just explain how I
really need a friend right now,

36:58.562 --> 37:01.665
a friend, instead of turning to guys,

37:01.699 --> 37:04.668
just random guys...

37:05.002 --> 37:07.570
Guys like Henry.

37:07.605 --> 37:08.838
I wouldn't bring that up.

37:08.873 --> 37:11.608
I know, I know, I was
just thinking out loud.

37:11.642 --> 37:13.576
I mean, Henry?

37:13.611 --> 37:16.946
(GROANS) I can't believe I did that!

37:16.981 --> 37:21.551
Yeah, I should just concentrate
on school this summer,

37:21.585 --> 37:23.820
and just forget about guys.

37:23.854 --> 37:26.690
Just for the summer.
Just clear my palate.

37:26.724 --> 37:30.627
Yeah, that's a great idea. Me, too. I
just need to take the summer off from guys

37:30.661 --> 37:34.931
and think about myself and do what
I want to do and focus on school.

37:34.965 --> 37:37.534
Maybe we can convince my mom that's
what we're really going to do.

37:37.568 --> 37:39.436
That is what we're really going to do.

37:39.470 --> 37:41.738
Really? You think the two
of us can really do th?

37:41.772 --> 37:44.507
I think the two of us can do anything.

37:44.542 --> 37:45.709
If your mom lets you stay here.

37:47.778 --> 37:49.879
I just can't do it on my own.

37:49.914 --> 37:51.548
Everything that's
happened to me this year

37:51.582 --> 37:53.450
has made me too weak.

37:53.484 --> 37:56.853
I need Grace. I need my
best friend to live with me.

37:56.887 --> 37:58.855
The two of us need each other,

37:58.889 --> 38:00.523
and together, we can do anything,

38:00.558 --> 38:02.625
including staying away from guys.

38:02.660 --> 38:04.928
Mmm-hmm. Please, Mom, please, please.

38:04.962 --> 38:07.597
You know, Adrian, Jack is moving out,

38:07.631 --> 38:10.500
so maybe you two girls could live here,

38:10.534 --> 38:12.669
and I can help you stay on track.

38:12.703 --> 38:13.803
Or I bet if you just move home,

38:13.838 --> 38:15.638
your mom can help you focus on school.

38:15.673 --> 38:17.707
It doesn't work living here, Mom.

38:17.742 --> 38:19.542
You see what's happened to me.

38:19.577 --> 38:22.479
I just end up going out with
guys to get away from being here.

38:22.513 --> 38:25.615
Please, please. You have to
let me grow up eventually.

38:25.649 --> 38:26.816
I'm going away to college in a year.

38:28.519 --> 38:30.754
Okay, if I don't do
what I say I'm gonna do,

38:30.788 --> 38:32.522
we don't do what we're
saying we're gonna do,

38:32.556 --> 38:34.891
which is to focus on school
and not go out with any guys,

38:34.925 --> 38:37.660
I swear to you, I swear,

38:37.695 --> 38:38.795
I will stay at home to go to college.

38:38.829 --> 38:39.829
For the first year.

38:41.599 --> 38:43.733
Please, Mom. Please, please. Please.

38:43.768 --> 38:44.801
Please.

38:47.738 --> 38:50.440
Well, I think that's an excellent idea.

38:50.474 --> 38:52.642
What's an excellent
idea? That we go home now?

38:52.676 --> 38:53.877
I think that's an excellent idea.

38:53.911 --> 38:56.679
No, Amy was telling me that she's, uh...

38:56.714 --> 38:58.715
Thinking about going to summer school.

38:58.749 --> 39:00.717
What? Why would you do that?

39:00.751 --> 39:03.553
Because she coutd, you know,
get some courses out of the way,

39:03.587 --> 39:05.555
and then focus on some other things.

39:05.589 --> 39:07.924
Like wedding plans, even. Maybe.

39:07.958 --> 39:09.659
What?

39:09.693 --> 39:12.495
There's nothing wrong with
her going to summer school.

39:12.530 --> 39:13.730
Mom, she's just going to summer school

39:13.764 --> 39:15.532
'cause Lauren is going to summer school,

39:15.566 --> 39:17.600
'cause she and Madison
decided to go to summer school

39:17.635 --> 39:18.802
because their parents were making them

39:18.836 --> 39:20.603
either get a job or go to summer school.

39:20.638 --> 39:22.772
And now, Lauren is not
speaking to Madison,

39:22.807 --> 39:26.743
so apparently, now Amy is
going just to support Lauren.

39:26.777 --> 39:29.546
You think I can't hear you on the
phone when you're in the car with me?

39:29.580 --> 39:31.948
It doesn't matter why I'm
going. It would be good for me.

39:31.982 --> 39:34.884
Yeah. And you know who
else it would be good for?

39:34.919 --> 39:37.520
No. Ethan.

39:37.555 --> 39:39.756
Ethan? Ethan's in juvie for the summer.

39:40.691 --> 39:41.724
Well...

39:41.759 --> 39:43.593
Oh, no.

39:43.627 --> 39:47.730
They have a little issue with
overcrowding, so we're getting him early.

39:47.765 --> 39:50.967
But he's going to continue doing his
community service work on the weekends,

39:51.001 --> 39:53.670
but I want him in summer school as well.

39:53.704 --> 39:56.573
You just got Nora out of here
after just getting me out of here,

39:56.607 --> 39:58.708
after just getting a dozen
other kids out of here.

39:58.742 --> 40:04.514
I know. That's why I have the room

40:04.548 --> 40:06.916
and the time to bring Ethan in.

40:06.951 --> 40:08.785
He stole from you.

40:08.819 --> 40:12.722
You stole from me.
You stole things, too.

40:12.756 --> 40:14.724
Yeah, like food, maybe.

40:14.758 --> 40:15.892
(SIGHS)

40:15.926 --> 40:17.894
What? He is way worse than I was.

40:19.964 --> 40:21.965
He is. I like a challenge.

40:21.999 --> 40:23.633
And so does Amy.

40:23.667 --> 40:25.668
And if Ethan is in summer school,

40:25.703 --> 40:28.838
I'm sure Amy wouldn't mind keeping
an eye on him, would you, Amy?

40:29.974 --> 40:33.910
Uh, no. No, of course not.

40:33.944 --> 40:37.547
I'm gonna go visit with John and
Shakur. Let the two of you talk.

40:42.686 --> 40:44.487
You really want to go to summer school?

40:44.522 --> 40:45.855
'Cause you don't have
to go to summer school,

40:45.890 --> 40:47.957
and you don't have to plan a wedding.

40:47.992 --> 40:53.563
You're absolutely right. You shouldn't be
in any rush, and you should take your time

40:53.597 --> 40:56.699
and plan the wedding for whenever
you want. It's your wedding.

40:56.734 --> 40:58.601
Well, it's our wedding.

40:58.636 --> 41:01.838
Not really. But I promise to show up.

41:01.872 --> 41:03.773
And you can decide everything,

41:03.807 --> 41:05.842
I'll go along with anything
you want, even the date.

41:08.012 --> 41:11.481
Well,

41:11.515 --> 41:13.583
I was thinking maybe June?

41:13.951 --> 41:14.951
All right.

41:19.790 --> 41:21.791
Sorry, we were sitting
in front of your house.

41:21.825 --> 41:23.927
We just didn't expect
you to drive up, you know.

41:23.961 --> 41:25.728
We LoJacked her.

41:25.763 --> 41:28.898
And all her friends. We
always know where she is.

41:28.933 --> 41:31.668
I understand. If I had a daughter,
I'd be protective of her, too.

41:31.702 --> 41:32.702
Yeah, it's just...

41:32.736 --> 41:34.437
This is her first boyfriend.

41:34.471 --> 41:36.639
And she's our only
daughter, and, well...

41:36.674 --> 41:39.475
She told us about Ben's life...

41:39.510 --> 41:42.745
It's not as bad as it
sounds. He's a good kid, Ben.

41:42.780 --> 41:44.914
They're probably all just off at the...

41:46.684 --> 41:47.717
Movies.

41:52.623 --> 41:54.657
Do I smell pot?

41:54.692 --> 41:57.760
Do you? Does he?

41:57.795 --> 42:01.631
Yeah, I think he does.
Dylan, what's going on here?

42:01.665 --> 42:02.932
Uh...

42:02.967 --> 42:06.669
My, uh... My fault.

42:06.704 --> 42:09.672
Someone gave me something
at the party last night,

42:09.707 --> 42:10.940
I just suggested...

42:10.975 --> 42:12.542
Yeah, he did.

42:13.944 --> 42:16.813
You're Dylan's...

42:16.847 --> 42:17.914
Yes. Yeah.

42:18.916 --> 42:19.916
Hi, King.
