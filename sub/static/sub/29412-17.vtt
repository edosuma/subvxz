Wes Keeler, 49,

00:04.772 --> 00:07.341
pricked in the upper right arm
by a cactus four days ago.

00:07.375 --> 00:08.942
Temp 102.5.

00:08.976 --> 00:11.579
Wound is seriously infected.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.447
FEMALE EMT: He was
leading a camping trip
on Mount Thayer.

00:13.481 --> 00:15.116
We couldn't leave 'em
up there alone.

00:15.149 --> 00:17.218
BP's 86/51.
Tachycardic.

00:17.251 --> 00:18.386
Rapid,
shallow breathing.

00:18.419 --> 00:19.787
Signs of sepsis.

00:19.820 --> 00:20.921
You gonna have to
cut his arm off?

00:20.954 --> 00:22.056
I'll be fine!

00:22.090 --> 00:23.824
We need to debride
the wound stat!

00:34.168 --> 00:36.937
Shaun, I've been
looking all over for you.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.807
Hey, uh, h-how about
getting some breakfast?
Some pancakes?

00:39.840 --> 00:41.375
No. I'm not hungry.

00:41.409 --> 00:42.843
(SIGHS) Okay.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.313
Um, how about
coming over for
dinner tonight?

00:45.346 --> 00:46.980
Is Debbie
making lasagna?

00:47.014 --> 00:48.082
She could.

00:48.116 --> 00:49.850
No, thank you.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.519
Okay, Shaun.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.387
Um, can we just
stop and...

00:53.421 --> 00:55.656
And talk
for just a minute?

00:55.689 --> 00:57.091
(SCOFFS)

00:57.125 --> 01:00.328
Why are... Aren't you, uh,
responding to my texts?

01:00.361 --> 01:01.529
Are you upset?

01:01.562 --> 01:03.264
Are you sad
because of Lea?
Yes. Yes.

01:03.297 --> 01:05.833
I am very sad.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.401
But it will be okay.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.104
Yeah, of course
it'll be okay.

01:10.138 --> 01:12.206
I'm still
going to be with Lea.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.274
Wait. What?

01:14.108 --> 01:16.744
She said she loves me.

01:16.777 --> 01:18.546
She also gave you
a hundred reasons

01:18.579 --> 01:20.248
why she can't be
with you, Shaun.
Yes. Yes.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.216
She gave me
very specific reasons

01:22.250 --> 01:23.684
why we can't be together,

01:23.717 --> 01:25.919
but I've overcome
other challenges...

01:25.953 --> 01:28.256
No, Shaun, it's not...
...to become a good doctor,
a good friend.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.824
It's not about
overcoming challenges.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.226
It's not about you.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.627
It's about Lea.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.434
ALICE: I can't take two steps
without falling down.

01:40.468 --> 01:41.735
Is the issue
balance or weakness?

01:41.769 --> 01:42.836
All of the above.

01:42.870 --> 01:45.105
Fatigue, dizziness,
light-headedness,
headaches,

01:45.139 --> 01:46.540
occasional bouts
of nausea.

01:46.574 --> 01:47.708
And when d...

01:47.741 --> 01:50.311
Five years ago, just after
the birth of my daughter.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.645
And there's
no discernible fluctuation

01:51.679 --> 01:53.647
based on time of day
or time of the month.

01:53.681 --> 01:56.116
Temp 98.2. BP 111/78.

01:56.150 --> 01:59.119
That'll drop to 80/50
when I'm upright.

01:59.153 --> 02:01.222
I don't drink, smoke,
or take drugs.

02:01.255 --> 02:02.856
I haven't traveled
outside of the country

02:02.890 --> 02:04.091
in the last ten years.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.160
And there's no family history
of a similar condition.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.829
You've been
through this before.

02:08.862 --> 02:11.799
Seventeen times.
Eighteen if you count
the naturopath in Seattle.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.301
Which I don't.

02:13.334 --> 02:16.069
No one has been able
to give me a diagnosis.

02:17.505 --> 02:20.040
We need to do an EKG
and stress test,

02:20.073 --> 02:22.443
get a CT of your chest,
abdomen, and pelvis.

02:22.476 --> 02:23.911
Let me
save you some time.

02:23.944 --> 02:27.781
Five years' worth of tests,
labs, scans, reports...

02:29.317 --> 02:30.851
My entire
medical odyssey.

02:33.254 --> 02:34.655
Fun.

02:56.977 --> 02:58.712
Uh, you changed
your number.

02:58.746 --> 03:01.114
Right.
Um, it's a long story.

03:01.148 --> 03:04.318
Uh, Dash, you remember
Dr. Melendez, Dr. Murphy?

03:04.352 --> 03:05.386
Yeah, of course.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.788
Uh, you gave my wife
six more good months.

03:07.821 --> 03:11.091
We considered
renaming our cat
after you.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.994
That would have been foolish.
Cats remember their names.

03:15.128 --> 03:17.665
Sorry for your loss.
Wish we could've done more.

03:18.399 --> 03:19.733

Hi.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.648
(BEEP)
I think the infection
spread quickly

03:34.682 --> 03:36.950
because of the
underlying damage
to your liver and kidney.

03:36.984 --> 03:39.152
We'll need to keep you
on a prolonged course
of IV antibiotics.

03:39.186 --> 03:40.988
Hey, you hear
that, guys?

03:41.021 --> 03:44.558
Hep C and heroin
aren't as much fun
as they sound.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.026
Although one was more fun
than the other...

03:46.059 --> 03:47.127
For a while.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.129
Don't they have
somewhere else to go?

03:49.162 --> 03:50.731
Not likely.

03:50.764 --> 03:54.234
Most of them haven't seen
their parents in years,
so they're with me...

the infection's spread.

Mm...
What about vasculitis?

04:45.619 --> 04:46.887
Or dysautonomia?

04:46.920 --> 04:49.423
Both are consistent
with weakness and fatigue.

04:49.457 --> 04:50.991
Her temporal artery biopsy
was negative.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.926
That rules out vasculitis.
Mm.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.429
And I thought I saw something
about dysautonomia in here.

04:55.463 --> 04:58.231
There are 15 different causes
of dysautonomia.

04:58.265 --> 04:59.600
Seven have been
ruled out.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.135
The rest are inconsistent
with Alice's symptoms

05:02.169 --> 05:04.472
or have
no definitive
diagnostic test.

05:04.505 --> 05:06.740
How did you make Dr. Lim

after you had been friends
for so long?

directed at you.

fall in love
with you, Shaun.

05:23.290 --> 05:25.225
It unfolds naturally
over time.

05:25.258 --> 05:28.028
That's not true.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.564
Everyone starts off
not loving you.

05:30.598 --> 05:33.033
Then you say and do things
that make them love you.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.068
Or not. That's the
point of romance.

05:35.703 --> 05:36.937
But romance is harder

05:36.970 --> 05:39.807
if you're already friends
with the person.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.611
You can't hide the less
attractive parts of yourself.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.979
It can be an advantage.

06:30.558 --> 06:31.725
That was a little harsh.

06:31.759 --> 06:32.893
We're talking
about your love life.

06:32.926 --> 06:36.497
Talking about
my love life is important.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.065
It helps clear my head

06:38.098 --> 06:39.767
so I can focus
on the medicine.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.273
Intracranial hypotension.

06:47.941 --> 06:51.211
It is consistent
with Alice's headaches

06:51.244 --> 06:53.714
and dizziness getting worse
when she's upright.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.183
And a leak in spinal fluid
can be triggered

06:56.216 --> 06:58.418
by severe
intracranial pressure
during childbirth.

06:58.452 --> 06:59.753
To confirm I'm right,

06:59.787 --> 07:02.255
we need to insert
a lumbar drain
into Alice's spine,

07:02.289 --> 07:05.526
infuse her with fluid,
and see if her
symptoms improve.

07:05.559 --> 07:06.594
But if you're wrong,

07:06.627 --> 07:08.962
she'll have
an excruciating
headache,

07:08.996 --> 07:11.499
massive brain pressure,
temporary vision loss...

07:11.532 --> 07:12.866
She'll give her consent.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.669
It's a reasonable diagnosis,

07:15.703 --> 07:18.706
and the patient's desperate
for an answer.

07:26.547 --> 07:29.116
Can you do
the procedure alone?

07:29.149 --> 07:32.252
Only one doctor is needed
to insert a lumbar drain,

07:32.285 --> 07:35.188
and I have a time-sensitive
matter to take care of.

that you're flexible
and attentive to my needs

is to pull me away from work

make me drive
all the way across town,

to be a tough guy

21:10.102 --> 21:12.372
I-I understand.
I want to do it.

21:12.405 --> 21:16.208
Medullary hyperplasia
is not terminal
or progressive.

21:16.242 --> 21:18.645
You could have
a normal life expectancy

21:18.678 --> 21:19.946
in your
current condition.

21:19.979 --> 21:22.181
My "current condition"
is pathetic.

21:22.214 --> 21:23.450
I'm having the surgery.

21:23.483 --> 21:24.751
OWEN: Alice.

21:24.784 --> 21:26.586
This could kill you.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.989
**

21:30.022 --> 21:31.991
I love you.

21:32.024 --> 21:33.860
I won't risk your life.

21:37.163 --> 21:39.231
If you insist on
going through with this...

21:42.702 --> 21:44.270
Ruby and I are leaving.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.440
**

21:50.877 --> 21:54.747
If you love her,
you shouldn't leave her.

21:54.781 --> 21:56.949
It's not her fault
she's sick.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.318
And she just wants
to make things better.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.020
It isn't fair.
DR. MELENDEZ: Shaun.

22:01.053 --> 22:03.790
There is nothing worse
than losing the person
you love.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.392
(SIGHS)

22:05.425 --> 22:07.794
DR. MELENDEZ:
I'm sorry. This isn't
Dr. Murphy's call.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.496
Nor is it mine.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.631
We'll give you two
some time.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.133
**

22:16.503 --> 22:17.870
He's right.

22:20.440 --> 22:23.009
I-I can't lose
you and Ruby.

22:23.042 --> 22:25.044
I won't do it. I won't...
I won't do the surgery.

22:25.077 --> 22:28.681
**

22:36.055 --> 22:38.825
Wes suffered
major cardiac damage.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.593
We can't
solve one problem
with this guy

22:40.627 --> 22:41.861
before
the next one hits.

22:41.894 --> 22:44.631
He's stable now,
but his heart can't handle

22:44.664 --> 22:46.733
the fluid volume shifts
of standard dialysis.

22:46.766 --> 22:48.801
So the only thing
keeping him alive
will also kill him.

22:48.835 --> 22:50.603
We could put him
on low-flow dialysis.

22:50.637 --> 22:52.204
Keep him in the ICU
'round the clock.

22:52.238 --> 22:53.706
That'll buy him
a little time.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.608
Very little.

22:55.642 --> 22:57.610
Call UNOS. See if
they'll move him up the list.

22:57.644 --> 22:58.911
Where are we
with family members?

22:58.945 --> 23:00.813
Two of Wes' cousins
agreed to be tested.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.515
We're waiting on
the results.
Good.

23:02.549 --> 23:05.384
Get on the phone with
any other family you can find.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.820
Tell them if their man
doesn't get a kidney
in the next couple days,

23:07.854 --> 23:10.490
they should make arrangements
to say their goodbyes.

23:10.523 --> 23:13.493
**

23:23.903 --> 23:26.305
New kicks won't help
you outrun me.

23:26.338 --> 23:27.406
(LAUGHS)

23:27.440 --> 23:30.743
Um, they're recipes.

23:30.777 --> 23:31.844
From Dash.

23:31.878 --> 23:34.113
Well, from Kayla.

23:34.146 --> 23:35.915
Kayla by way of Dash.

23:35.948 --> 23:37.116
It's complicated.

23:37.149 --> 23:38.918
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

23:41.988 --> 23:43.456
He asked me on a date.

23:47.927 --> 23:49.428
(CHUCKLES)

23:52.565 --> 23:53.600
What did you say?

23:53.633 --> 23:56.102
Nothing. I stammered,
and then I fled.

23:56.135 --> 23:57.136
(LAUGHS)

23:59.171 --> 24:00.573
(CLAIRE CHUCKLES)

24:02.441 --> 24:03.710
What did you want to say?

24:03.743 --> 24:06.312
Ohh. I don't know.

24:06.345 --> 24:08.347
**

24:10.016 --> 24:11.350
Shaun was right.

24:13.152 --> 24:15.354
Coming home to
an empty apartment
really sucks.

24:19.325 --> 24:20.993
I...

24:21.027 --> 24:23.730
Used men
to make me feel better.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.798
Most of them
didn't mind.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.734
But...

24:27.767 --> 24:30.402
I...

24:30.436 --> 24:34.106
Don't trust myself not to hurt
someone I care about.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.913
Claire, it's not
that complicated.

24:42.281 --> 24:45.151
You lit up this morning
when you saw him.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.655
He seems
to make you happy.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.293
You deserve to be happy.

25:03.135 --> 25:04.771
(GROANS)

25:14.380 --> 25:15.381
Mmm.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.018
How you feeling?

25:20.419 --> 25:22.689
I'm not high,
if that's what
you're asking.

25:22.722 --> 25:24.090
It's not.

25:26.425 --> 25:29.495
You know,
earlier in the car,

25:29.528 --> 25:31.230
I pushed too hard,

25:32.198 --> 25:34.400
made you feel cornered.

25:34.433 --> 25:35.668
I'm sorry.

25:37.236 --> 25:38.504
You didn't know.

25:42.809 --> 25:44.343
I, uh...

25:44.376 --> 25:46.012
I talked to your mom.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.015
Is she totally
freaking out?

25:49.048 --> 25:50.182
She's concerned.

25:50.216 --> 25:54.520
And we talked about
finding a therapist
in Phoenix

25:54.553 --> 25:58.090
who specializes
in treating anxiety.

25:59.659 --> 26:02.328
So you're pawning me off
on a total stranger?

26:02.361 --> 26:03.896
No. No. I...

26:07.133 --> 26:08.801
I thought you'd be
more comfortable

26:08.835 --> 26:10.269
talking to someone
who's not...

26:11.270 --> 26:14.140
She said you've been
pretty withdrawn lately.

26:19.411 --> 26:23.549
I know things between
your mom and I are a little...

26:23.582 --> 26:24.751
Screwed up?

26:24.784 --> 26:27.754
**

26:27.787 --> 26:28.788
Unsettled.

26:30.389 --> 26:32.558
Is that
making you feel anxious?

26:32.591 --> 26:34.727
No.

26:34.761 --> 26:35.895
It's not you.

26:38.330 --> 26:39.899
It's nothing.
It's... It's okay.

26:39.932 --> 26:41.868
No, it's obviously not.

26:43.936 --> 26:46.105
Some of this is on you.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.874
You know,
every time we talk,

26:47.907 --> 26:49.742
you don't tell me anything
about your life.

26:49.776 --> 26:51.243
That's because
you don't want
to know anything.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.578
That's not true!

26:54.747 --> 26:57.516
You're busy saving patients
a hundred hours a week.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.320
You don't want to feel
guilty about being
a thousand miles away.

27:01.353 --> 27:04.757
You just want to know
that I'm okay.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.893
So I say I'm okay.

27:06.926 --> 27:09.428
**

27:16.168 --> 27:18.237
DR. REZNICK: Ew!

27:18.270 --> 27:19.305
That's annoying.

27:21.107 --> 27:22.742
Can you do that
someplace else?

27:22.775 --> 27:26.345
I'm trying to find a better
solution for my patient.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.114
Your patient
is being discharged.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.882
I'm trying to get a kidney
for a dying guy.

27:29.916 --> 27:31.818
You're watching
gross videos.

27:31.851 --> 27:33.385
I'm waiting to hear back
from UNOS.

27:35.321 --> 27:36.522
Ew!

27:41.694 --> 27:43.996
Do you prefer
being called or texted?

27:44.030 --> 27:45.597
Neither.

27:45.631 --> 27:48.768
Do you like surprises
or do you find them
irritating?

27:48.801 --> 27:50.669
I find this irritating.

27:50.703 --> 27:52.071
It's research.

27:52.104 --> 27:53.639
Lea said
we can't be together

27:53.672 --> 27:56.608
because she is
too needy and selfish
to deal with my issues.

27:56.642 --> 27:58.144
You are the most
selfish person I know,

27:58.177 --> 27:59.812
so you are
a good subject.

28:00.713 --> 28:02.048
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

28:04.884 --> 28:08.254
Lea's right.
She is needy and selfish.

28:08.287 --> 28:10.156
Find someone who loves you
the way you are.

28:12.191 --> 28:15.261
People always say that,
but shouldn't we be
with someone

28:15.294 --> 28:18.130
who makes us
a better version
of ourselves?

28:18.164 --> 28:20.232
**

28:22.701 --> 28:23.702
Maybe.

28:26.172 --> 28:28.440
But trying not to be autistic
won't make you better.

28:30.176 --> 28:33.379
**

28:45.057 --> 28:47.359
I'm sorry you still don't
feel good, Mommy.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.361
Well, I'll feel better
when I'm home.

28:49.395 --> 28:51.697
Eating those delicious cookies
that you make for me.

28:51.730 --> 28:54.733
You don't
have to go home.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.402
I invented
a better surgery.

28:56.435 --> 28:58.871
Instead of removing
both your adrenal glands,

28:58.905 --> 29:02.541
we can just squeeze out the
hyperplastic medullary part...

29:02.574 --> 29:03.910
Like popping a pimple.

29:04.944 --> 29:06.846
You "invented" a surgery?

29:06.879 --> 29:09.015
Dr. Murphy's come up
with a surgical plan

29:09.048 --> 29:11.483
that could curb
overproduction
of your hormones

29:11.517 --> 29:13.152
while leaving you
some adrenal function.

29:13.185 --> 29:14.253
What are the chances
it'll work?

29:14.286 --> 29:16.355
Oh, we don't know.

29:16.388 --> 29:17.890
DR. MELENDEZ:
Since it's never
been done before,

29:17.924 --> 29:19.491
it's difficult
to predict the outcome,

29:19.525 --> 29:22.694
but it is a safe
and viable treatment option.

29:22.728 --> 29:25.197
**

29:37.609 --> 29:38.978
MAX: Is Wes dying?

29:47.987 --> 29:49.956
We're doing
everything we can
to help him.

29:49.989 --> 29:52.391
I snuck a look at his chart
when no one was around.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.126
You know that's
a crime, right?

29:54.160 --> 29:55.294
Only a misdemeanor.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.199
You should talk to Wes.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.268
(SIGHS)

30:02.301 --> 30:05.204
**

30:05.237 --> 30:06.839
We all got tested.

30:08.507 --> 30:09.508
I'm a match.

30:11.477 --> 30:12.879
I'm gonna give Wes
my kidney.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.115
**

30:26.192 --> 30:28.794
We've discussed your offer
at length, Max.

30:28.827 --> 30:33.099
It's incredibly admirable
and generous.

30:33.132 --> 30:34.500
But you're 16.

30:34.533 --> 30:37.136
Living donors have to be
18 years old.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.938
I'm emancipated.

30:38.971 --> 30:40.672
I can give consent
for myself.

30:40.706 --> 30:42.308
But it's still
up to the hospital

30:42.341 --> 30:44.243
to decide
if this is a good idea.

30:44.276 --> 30:47.379
We don't feel this is
in your best interest.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.716
DR. ANDREWS: Max.

30:50.749 --> 30:54.520
The surgery's much harder
on the donor
than the recipient.

30:54.553 --> 30:57.023
You could have postoperative
bleeding or infection.

30:57.056 --> 30:58.824
And it's
incredibly painful.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.427
I've been through more crap
than any of you.

31:01.460 --> 31:02.828
I can handle it.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.530
There are also
long-term consequences...

31:04.563 --> 31:06.432
High blood pressure,
renal failure.

31:06.465 --> 31:08.600
If something happens
to your other kidney,
you don't have a spare.

31:08.634 --> 31:11.003
I know how to subtract.
I'm cool with it.

31:11.037 --> 31:13.039
DR. REZNICK: And the recovery
is long and hard.

31:13.072 --> 31:16.142
You would need someone to
help you get dressed and bathe

31:16.175 --> 31:17.876
and make sure you take
all your medications.

31:17.910 --> 31:20.947
I've been taking care
of myself just fine
for a long time.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.283
**

31:24.316 --> 31:26.618
Actually, Max,

31:26.652 --> 31:29.855
you've been in juvie
and on drugs.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.258
You're not
taking care of yourself.

31:35.594 --> 31:38.464
Okay, I get it.

31:38.497 --> 31:39.498
I'm a screw-up.

31:40.532 --> 31:42.401
But Wes isn't.

31:42.434 --> 31:46.205
He's bailed me
out of jail.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.706
He's picked me up
in the middle of the night

31:47.739 --> 31:49.775
when I was
too messed up to drive.

31:49.808 --> 31:51.843
He's cleaned me up
after fights.

31:51.877 --> 31:54.180
**

31:54.213 --> 31:57.583
(VOICE BREAKING)
He came with me
to my sister's funeral.

31:59.285 --> 32:02.054
If I manage
to stay out of jail,

32:02.088 --> 32:04.223
it's because of Wes.

32:04.256 --> 32:07.426
If I'm a halfway decent
father someday,

32:09.228 --> 32:11.063
if I'm not
a lost cause,

32:12.631 --> 32:15.567
it's because
Wes never gave up on me.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.736
**

32:19.271 --> 32:20.606
He shouldn't die

32:20.639 --> 32:23.409
because I made
dumbass decisions.

32:24.343 --> 32:27.746

It's your surgery.

32:44.830 --> 32:47.866
And we have the exact
same amount of
experience with this.

32:54.906 --> 32:58.410
Free up the medulla along
the inner cortical surface.

the cortex.

SHAUN: Mm.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.920
Nothing's coming out.

33:08.954 --> 33:11.357
Try using your fingers
to pinch the gland.

33:11.390 --> 33:13.225
Use a circular motion
to coax it out.

33:16.195 --> 33:17.763
I've popped
my share of pimples.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.962
One down, one to go.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.602
Wes is like a father
to Max.

33:56.635 --> 33:57.703
If he were
his actual father,

33:57.736 --> 33:59.205
we wouldn't hesitate
to let him do it.

33:59.238 --> 34:00.372
I think we should.

Me, too.

got to me.

a lifetime of bad ones.

No, they've given you
a reason to be proud.

They all got tested
to see if they were
a match.

Max is.

He wants
to give you his kidney.

the transplant, Wes.

35:39.471 --> 35:40.772
I'm sorry.

Your blood and tissue type
were good.

that Wes produces antibodies
in reaction to your cells.

No.
