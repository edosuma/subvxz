You lied to me!

00:52.218 --> 00:54.596
Yeah, well, if I'd told you
we were volunteering,

00:54.679 --> 00:56.639
you would have complained
the whole way here.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.224
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:58.308 --> 00:59.184
We're volunteering?

00:59.392 --> 01:00.643
At a nursing home?

01:00.769 --> 01:01.644
On purpose?

01:01.895 --> 01:03.855
Over my undead body!

01:04.856 --> 01:07.692
Hey Scratch, wanna know my
favorite thing about ghosts?

01:08.151 --> 01:09.611
You can walk right through 'em!

01:12.906 --> 01:16.451
What you people just did is considered
very rude in the ghost world.

01:16.534 --> 01:17.577
C'mon, Scratch.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.497
Volunteering bonds us McGees together.

01:20.872 --> 01:21.956
Well, I'm no McGee.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.167
Good point. What is your last name?

01:24.250 --> 01:26.169
I'm a one-name icon, baby.

01:26.252 --> 01:29.881
Uh, are you sure? 'Cause
I thought your last name was...

01:33.051 --> 01:35.303
Ah, man, you get me
every time with that thing.

01:35.386 --> 01:37.347
- We had to buy our son a toy

01:37.430 --> 01:38.765
called the "Obnoxitron?"

01:42.852 --> 01:45.980
Right arm! Left leg! Jazz hands!

01:46.064 --> 01:47.440
Can we pick up the pace, dear?

01:47.524 --> 01:49.442
We don't exactly have all
the time in the world.

01:49.984 --> 01:53.154
You heard her, double time!
Left! Right! Left! Right!

01:53.613 --> 01:55.365
Well, that's a great suggestion!

01:55.448 --> 01:56.491
You work for the city?

01:56.574 --> 01:58.201
Because I have a few ideas.

01:58.284 --> 01:59.994
Oh-ho! Let me be your mouth.

02:00.078 --> 02:01.955
I'll pass 'em right on
to the City Council!

02:02.038 --> 02:03.581
One. Libraries.

02:03.665 --> 02:05.875
Why should my taxes pay for books

02:05.959 --> 02:08.002
so other people
can read for free? B!

02:08.086 --> 02:09.420
- Oh, boy.
Public parks.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.343
Darryl, they got nothing.

02:15.426 --> 02:16.427
That guy over there?

02:16.511 --> 02:18.471
One of his cards is a napkin.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.349
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm all in.

02:21.808 --> 02:22.892
Wow, Patty.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.145
You've lived in Brighton your whole life?

02:25.353 --> 02:27.313
My family and I just moved to town.

02:27.438 --> 02:30.733
Hmm. Well, we all make mistakes.

02:31.192 --> 02:34.696
Mine was called Bobby Daniels,
and he rode a motorcycle.

02:34.779 --> 02:36.239
- Hmm-mm-mm.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.490
Uh, that's, um...

02:37.574 --> 02:40.285
Hey, I think that guy
with the napkin is cheating.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.078
You mean, he's <i>also</i> cheating.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.664
I was looking for sympathy, not judgment.

02:45.039 --> 02:46.166
Patty, is that you?

02:46.708 --> 02:47.959
What is this place?

02:48.334 --> 02:51.212
Oh, the old Brighton Bandshell.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.256
We used to have concerts in the park.

02:53.590 --> 02:57.343
Everyone would bring a picnic
and dance to the music.

02:58.469 --> 03:02.432
Anyway, a tornado tore down
the whole bandshell in '79.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.809
- That's terrible!
- Oh my gosh, that's awesome!

03:05.518 --> 03:08.479
I mean, tornadoes are awesome,
not, uh, it's not awesome

03:08.563 --> 03:09.814
- that her special place was,
- Uh-huh.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.316
- you know, ruined.
- You're getting there.

03:11.399 --> 03:13.526
But to be honest,
I don't feel too bad about it,

03:13.610 --> 03:15.320
'cause I'm not really invested
in this woman.

03:15.403 --> 03:16.696
I'm not even sure who she is.

03:16.779 --> 03:18.114
Why didn't the city rebuild it?

03:18.781 --> 03:20.533
"Not a priority," they said.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.035
Hmph.

03:22.118 --> 03:23.995
Brighton isn't what it used to be.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.456
- Scratch, I know what we need to do next.

03:26.539 --> 03:30.251
I'm really hoping it's order a pizza,
with pineapple this time!

03:30.335 --> 03:32.378
- Hmm?
- But I really fear that it's

03:32.462 --> 03:34.672
gonna be something about
putting the bandshell...

03:34.756 --> 03:37.175
- Yes, you get me!
- Oh, I get you, all right.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.469
- I get you 24-7.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.764
And finally, the citizen
proposes charging for...

03:43.306 --> 03:44.724
green lights.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.018
Not exactly sure how we'd even do that...

03:47.185 --> 03:48.978
We'll take all that
under advisement, McGee.

03:49.187 --> 03:52.023
Well, I have a hot date with a cool lady.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.399
See what I did...

03:53.483 --> 03:56.319
So, if there's no further business,
this meeting is adjour--

03:56.402 --> 04:01.157
Mr. Mayor, I've got business so further,
it'll melt your mind!

04:01.407 --> 04:02.784
Hello, Brighton City Council!

04:02.867 --> 04:04.869
I am Molly McGee,
and this is my brother Darryl.

04:05.203 --> 04:06.037
'Sup.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.163
My kids!

04:07.247 --> 04:09.791
Participating in local politics!

04:10.041 --> 04:11.751
I've never been more proud.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.920
Consider the future.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.673
It's where we'll spend
the rest of our lives.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.716
But what will it hold?

04:19.217 --> 04:20.969
The Brighton Mega-Arena!

04:21.052 --> 04:23.012
It's a 60,000 seat sports complex.

04:24.222 --> 04:25.056
A music venue.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.225
A world-class water park.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.895
- A dog run.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.730
- Whoops, wrong button.

04:32.814 --> 04:33.898
And a donut shop!

04:35.984 --> 04:36.859
So what do you think?

04:36.943 --> 04:38.695
Let's build this baby, right?

04:38.778 --> 04:42.240
Ms. McGee, your proposal
is certainly bold.

04:44.033 --> 04:48.913
But sadly, a 60,000 seat "Mega-Arena"
is too big for a small town like Brighton.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.791
Thank you and we do hope
you'll come back someday

04:51.874 --> 04:54.419
with something a little more realistic.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.966
Psych! That day is right now!

05:00.049 --> 05:02.593
The new
and improved Brighton Bandshell!

05:02.677 --> 05:03.928
A bait and switch!

05:04.012 --> 05:07.515
I watched her build both models
and I still did not see that coming!

05:07.682 --> 05:10.435
I just learned about the
original Brighton Bandshell

05:10.518 --> 05:12.395
and how much it meant to the community.

05:12.478 --> 05:13.688
Whoa, whoa,

05:13.771 --> 05:14.605
hold on.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.733
We're not gonna rebuild the bandshell.

05:16.816 --> 05:17.900
But...

05:17.984 --> 05:18.985
Times are hard,

05:19.068 --> 05:21.654
and we simply don't have the money
for a bandshell. I'm sorry.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.951
No, Mom. They can keep the donuts.

05:27.035 --> 05:30.163
Let them feast on the carcass
of a young girl's dreams.

05:36.711 --> 05:37.754
It's okay, honey.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.213
We know you tried your hardest.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.298
Thanks, Mom.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.550
But that wasn't my hardest.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.178
If they won't give me the
money to fix the bandshell,

05:45.261 --> 05:47.013
then I'm gonna take it to the streets!

Your hero has arrived.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.640
Uh, where did you get
so much money, Scratch?

07:12.723 --> 07:14.517
Well, you know, I'm very good at numbers.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.228
I just crunched 'em, I stretched 'em,
I analyzed my accounts,

07:17.311 --> 07:19.230
- I timed the market.

07:19.313 --> 07:20.690
- Did you rob a bank?

07:20.773 --> 07:22.275
Molly McGee!

07:22.483 --> 07:25.403
Do you really think so little of me?

07:27.363 --> 07:28.364
It was a credit union.

07:28.448 --> 07:29.824
Take it back! Take it back!

07:32.702 --> 07:35.079
Whoa. We raised a lot of money.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.623
But it's not enough.
We can pay for the materials,

07:37.707 --> 07:39.917
- but not for the labor.
- Aw, gee whiz,

07:40.001 --> 07:42.503
well, there's no way we can
build the bandshell ourselves.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.005
You know what? To cheer us up,

07:44.088 --> 07:46.382
let's go down in the park
and make fun of babies!

07:46.716 --> 07:48.176
Little dummies can't even walk.

07:48.259 --> 07:50.052
I mean, why do they make shoes for 'em?

07:50.136 --> 07:52.430
You're right about one thing, Scratch.

07:52.513 --> 07:54.223
We can't build the bandshell ourselves.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.893
I'm glad you're finally coming around
to reason on this one, Moll.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.353
No, I mean we can't build it alone.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.105
Oh, no. I don't like that face.

08:01.314 --> 08:02.482
It reeks of hope.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.233
- But what if the whole town pitched in?
- Oh, no!

08:04.317 --> 08:06.277
Stop turning, wheels in Molly's head!

08:06.360 --> 08:08.237
We'll have a community work day!

08:08.321 --> 08:09.989
No one's gonna work for free.

08:10.072 --> 08:13.534
Um, yes they will.
Because people care, Scratch.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.203
They'll show up. You'll see.

08:15.286 --> 08:18.581
And then you'll see my
famous "told ya" dance.

08:20.583 --> 08:21.792
Cringey.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.377
That was just a little preview for ya.

08:35.431 --> 08:37.099
People are totally coming, don't worry.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.852
Any... second now.

08:43.648 --> 08:44.690
Okay, they're not coming.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.359
Oh, excuse me, coming through,

08:46.442 --> 08:48.194
boy, it's so crowded around here.

08:48.277 --> 08:49.403
Hey Moll, how you doing?

08:49.487 --> 08:51.739
Oh sorry, you know,
I was trying to remember

08:51.822 --> 08:54.700
who it was that was gonna do
the "told ya" dance.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.410
Was it you, or was it?

08:56.494 --> 09:00.289
Na-ta-ta-ta! Ta-ta-ta-ta told ya!

09:01.249 --> 09:03.793
Ah, it's no fun if you're gonna be sad.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.420
Tough break, Moll. I'm not...

09:06.712 --> 09:09.257
Not really great with the feelings stuff,
so I'm just gonna...

09:09.340 --> 09:10.800
give you one of these.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.510
I guess it's... just us.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.554
Anyone know how to use a table saw?

09:16.681 --> 09:19.016
Darryl, not now with the Obnoxitron.

09:19.100 --> 09:20.142
It's not me.

09:23.271 --> 09:24.564
Patty!

09:24.647 --> 09:25.815
Sorry, we're late.

09:26.023 --> 09:28.693
Some of us don't travel
as fast as we used to.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.111
Then we'd better get to it!

09:30.444 --> 09:32.989
And, uh, hey, Scratch? Told ya.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.992
<i>♪ T-t-t-told ya
T-t-told ya ♪</i>

09:36.075 --> 09:39.203
<i>♪ T-t-t-t-t-t-t-told ya ♪</i>

09:39.787 --> 09:41.664
And this is the part
where I go like... bam!
