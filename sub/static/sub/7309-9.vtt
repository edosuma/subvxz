WEBVTT

00:40.822 --> 00:42.220
Open up, McGee.

00:43.851 --> 00:44.917
Hey, what's going on?

00:45.186 --> 00:46.809
Bzzzz!

00:47.992 --> 00:48.485
Um...

00:48.726 --> 00:50.486
That's what I've been
hearing all night long.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.875
Bzzzz. Bzzzz.

00:53.359 --> 00:54.694
You electrocuting sheep in here?

00:55.331 --> 00:56.331
Feels like it.

00:56.419 --> 00:58.147
You know what? That's
probably my shredder.

00:58.171 --> 01:00.491
You know that's funny 'cause
you say that like, well, uh...

01:00.564 --> 01:02.484
like I haven't been up
all night listening to it.

01:02.562 --> 01:03.789
I'm sorry, I'm having...

01:05.914 --> 01:06.680
It won't happen again.

01:06.704 --> 01:08.772
It does, and paper's
not gonna be the only

01:08.817 --> 01:10.224
thing getting shredded around here.

01:10.843 --> 01:11.843
Sorry.

01:27.546 --> 01:28.860
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

01:28.884 --> 01:29.953
Won't happen again.

01:34.092 --> 01:35.759
I think I killed someone, Tim.

02:30.954 --> 02:31.954
You okay?

02:32.074 --> 02:34.905
You asked me that 30 seconds ago, Mom.

02:35.013 --> 02:36.896
Yeah, well, you've been
in there over an hour.

02:36.949 --> 02:38.638
Yeah, well, how long
would you be in the shower

02:38.662 --> 02:40.417
if you were covered in mystery blood?

02:43.172 --> 02:44.665
You're sure that none of it is yours?

02:45.875 --> 02:46.332
Yeah.

02:46.709 --> 02:48.038
But you don't know whose it is?

02:48.142 --> 02:50.194
No. I told you.

02:50.616 --> 02:53.182
I was at Headliners with
these girls from school,

02:53.308 --> 02:55.038
we were watching this crappy band,

02:55.271 --> 02:57.905
the next thing I know,
I'm at your front door.

02:57.968 --> 02:59.046
You left out the part where you said

02:59.070 --> 03:00.230
you killed someone.

03:05.947 --> 03:07.193
Tim, that's not funny.

03:08.224 --> 03:09.464
You don't remember saying that?

03:12.955 --> 03:14.195
How much did you have to drink?

03:14.290 --> 03:14.864
Nothing.

03:15.169 --> 03:16.630
I'm under 21, remember?

03:16.720 --> 03:19.018
Really, because your
fake ID says you're 22.

03:21.795 --> 03:22.795
How much?

03:24.223 --> 03:25.971
Okay, I had a few drinks.

03:26.303 --> 03:29.123
Sarah, do you remember what happened
the last time you had "a few" drinks?

03:29.147 --> 03:30.147
No.

03:30.178 --> 03:32.114
That's the point. You can't drink.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.057
Last time you had a few
too many, you painted

03:34.081 --> 03:35.846
"bitch" on Katie Hutchinson's garage.

03:35.945 --> 03:37.151
I would have done that sober.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.581
That bitch stole my boyfriend.

03:41.365 --> 03:42.277
Tim, relax.

03:42.301 --> 03:44.579
I barely even touched
my second beer, okay?

03:44.705 --> 03:45.981
I remember because I had...

03:59.390 --> 04:00.390
You had to what?

04:03.719 --> 04:04.857
I had to study.

04:06.892 --> 04:07.892
That's right.

04:09.395 --> 04:11.004
After the concert, we
went to the food court,

04:11.028 --> 04:13.250
but I left early because
I had to go to the library.

04:13.322 --> 04:15.208
Good. Library's good and then?

04:18.680 --> 04:19.872
Why can't I remember?

04:22.322 --> 04:23.704
Someone could've slipped you something.

04:23.728 --> 04:25.098
No, Smart Girl 101,

04:25.122 --> 04:26.986
you don't take drinks
from guys you don't know.

04:27.010 --> 04:28.589
We should still get a urine sample.

04:33.579 --> 04:36.429
I can't pee in a mug with
a picture of Grandma on it.

04:40.265 --> 04:41.265
What are you doing?

04:41.465 --> 04:42.465
Calling the police.

04:42.558 --> 04:43.634
And telling them what?

04:44.315 --> 04:45.558
That I showed up at your front door

04:45.582 --> 04:47.518
with blood on my hands
saying I killed someone?

04:47.922 --> 04:49.522
Besides, Tim, that
could be animal blood.

04:50.243 --> 04:51.251
And what if it's not?

04:51.708 --> 04:53.601
Sarah, I'm a federal agent. I
have a responsibility...

04:53.625 --> 04:55.311
Tim, I didn't come to a federal agent.

04:58.352 --> 04:59.374
I came to my big brother.

05:03.918 --> 05:05.704
McGee's not answering his cell phone,

05:05.728 --> 05:07.883
pager or MySpace IM.

05:08.829 --> 05:10.439
McGee on MySpace, I gotta see that.

05:10.724 --> 05:11.266
Keep calling.

05:11.290 --> 05:13.516
Still trying to get
into his calendar, boss.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.177
You know, I'm not sure
what the problem is.

05:15.201 --> 05:17.122
When I was framed by
the Iranians for murder,

05:17.146 --> 05:19.871
I was late for many hours
before anyone even noticed.

05:20.066 --> 05:21.258
You're not McGee, Ziva.

05:21.401 --> 05:24.143
McTimex's brain is
hard-wired for punctuality.

05:24.305 --> 05:26.541
And sadly, scaring away potential mates.

05:27.844 --> 05:28.844
There we go.

05:29.404 --> 05:30.747
No doctor's appointments.

05:31.142 --> 05:32.719
He does have a personal trainer.

05:32.961 --> 05:34.095
Four times a week?

05:34.493 --> 05:36.555
And tomorrow, an 8:00 a.m. appointment

05:36.582 --> 05:38.441
at a Harley Davidson dealership?

05:38.782 --> 05:41.022
Either McGee's won the lottery
or he's got a sugar daddy.

05:42.652 --> 05:43.652
Yeah. Gibbs.

05:45.225 --> 05:46.225
Where?

05:46.533 --> 05:47.021
Dead?

05:47.478 --> 05:49.338
Sailor. Waverly campus. Gear up.

05:50.283 --> 05:52.094
What about McGee? We
haven't found him yet.

05:52.506 --> 05:53.506
I did.

05:53.778 --> 05:56.063
Or rather, he found
me. Sent me an email.

05:56.476 --> 05:57.460
Woke up sick.

05:57.484 --> 05:59.764
Laryngitis, won't be
coming in to work today.

06:00.356 --> 06:01.836
You know, I bet he sent you one, too.

06:12.843 --> 06:13.843
You still here?

06:16.930 --> 06:17.930
Hmm.

06:20.310 --> 06:21.942
Who emails in sick to work?

06:22.833 --> 06:24.536
If I called, they'd know I was lying.

06:25.442 --> 06:27.287
Oh, and if you have
laryngitis, you can't call.

06:28.573 --> 06:30.736
Have you been saving that one
for a comic book convention?

06:30.760 --> 06:32.593
Can we get back to the timeline, please?

06:34.314 --> 06:35.314
Okay...

06:35.818 --> 06:38.547
now you left the bar at 9:30 p.m.

06:38.915 --> 06:41.518
I got to the campus food
court at around 10:00.

06:42.945 --> 06:45.885
You showed up here at
my door at 2:30 a.m.

06:47.525 --> 06:49.460
That leaves four hours unaccounted for.

06:49.541 --> 06:50.724
I'm actually impressed.

06:51.513 --> 06:52.633
Is this what you do at work?

06:52.919 --> 06:53.870
Yeah? Really?

06:53.941 --> 06:55.994
State the obvious and
make pretty pie charts?

06:58.081 --> 07:01.276
No, we collect facts and
we formulate theories.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.925
But if you think you can do better.

07:06.267 --> 07:07.267
Well, okay.

07:11.510 --> 07:12.308
There are

07:12.424 --> 07:13.697
four hours unaccounted for.

07:13.975 --> 07:15.273
Of which I have no memory,

07:15.489 --> 07:18.710
so, I either drank more than I realized,

07:18.908 --> 07:22.483
repressed some kind of traumatic event,

07:23.218 --> 07:25.014
or was drugged.

07:25.444 --> 07:27.384
And the blood on my hands
and the fact that I'm always

07:27.408 --> 07:29.670
careful with what I drink
imply a traumatic event.

07:30.297 --> 07:31.498
But what and where?

07:32.434 --> 07:33.434
Answer...

07:34.002 --> 07:35.162
the shoes I bought yesterday.

07:35.562 --> 07:38.434
$32 on sale, plus I had
a back-to-school coupon.

07:38.766 --> 07:40.833
They're muddy, but the soles
are barely even scuffed,

07:40.857 --> 07:43.215
so I didn't walk the
five miles to your place.

07:43.941 --> 07:45.106
Okay, so how did I get here?

07:47.687 --> 07:49.169
When I left the food court, I had

07:49.193 --> 07:50.710
$14 in my back pocket

07:50.734 --> 07:52.667
and now there's only two,
and since it's a ten dollar

07:52.691 --> 07:54.716
taxi ride to your place, do the math,

07:54.740 --> 07:56.379
I must've taken a taxi cab here.

07:56.657 --> 07:57.697
And that's our first step.

07:57.934 --> 08:00.518
We find the driver.
We ask him where I was.

08:00.542 --> 08:03.776
And when we find out where I was,
we can find out what happened.

08:08.815 --> 08:11.843
Let's start by checking
local taxi dispatchers.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.453
There's two major cab companies.

08:13.883 --> 08:17.087
Dozens of gypsies. I'm
assuming you left from campus.

08:17.844 --> 08:18.949
It would definitely be a major.

08:18.973 --> 08:20.442
They'll have a log of the fare.

08:20.675 --> 08:22.952
Do you think you caught
the taxi on campus?

08:31.671 --> 08:33.804
Ready! Five, six,

08:33.885 --> 08:35.301
seven, eight. Hit, one,

08:35.371 --> 08:36.931
two, roll, three, four, look,

08:36.977 --> 08:38.798
five, hit, six, seven, down, eight.

08:38.822 --> 08:39.898
Go, one, two.

08:39.988 --> 08:41.571
This isn't the XFL ladies.

08:41.638 --> 08:42.953
This is Waverly.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.031
Save the pole dancing for
your boyfriend, Carolyn.

09:03.202 --> 09:04.762
Uh, you'll have to move your car, sir.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.406
You're in a passenger loading zone.

09:06.430 --> 09:07.824
I don't see any, uh, pass...

09:08.275 --> 09:10.272
Oh, well, you don't want to park here.

09:11.823 --> 09:13.341
You might want to yank
out your rent-a-cop manual

09:13.365 --> 09:15.165
- and recheck the pecking order.
- No, no, no.

09:15.456 --> 09:17.276
Your people are on the
other side of the quad.

09:25.574 --> 09:26.574
Well, that was quick.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.966
Solve this case already, DiNozzo?

09:29.773 --> 09:31.475
No. It's my hundredth body.

09:31.699 --> 09:33.304
Hey, listen, you wouldn't mind taking...

09:35.113 --> 09:36.924
Sorry. That's a bad idea.

09:36.996 --> 09:38.591
It seemed less disgusting in my head.

09:38.663 --> 09:40.366
By comparison with
what else is in there,

09:40.390 --> 09:41.200
I'm sure it was.

09:41.270 --> 09:42.991
Anything useful from that jogger, Ziva?

09:43.075 --> 09:45.631
If "I saw the body and I
called the police" is useful,

09:45.655 --> 09:46.462
the yes...

09:46.499 --> 09:47.897
Otherwise, no.

09:48.023 --> 09:49.545
Can't tell how long
the body's been here.

09:49.569 --> 09:51.589
Luckily, of course, I can.

09:51.760 --> 09:54.088
I must apologize for
our tardiness. We had...

09:54.435 --> 09:56.114
trouble parking the van.

09:56.231 --> 09:57.423
Homecoming.

09:58.323 --> 10:00.958
I would have thought McGee
would have beaten me up here.

10:01.102 --> 10:02.102
McGee's not here.

10:02.271 --> 10:02.710
Really?

10:02.773 --> 10:05.018
I could have sworn I saw
him in the parking lot.

10:05.287 --> 10:06.806
Well, we're at a college.

10:06.886 --> 10:08.826
Pencil-neck geeks are a dime a dozen.

10:11.787 --> 10:13.554
Ah, let me see.

10:20.785 --> 10:23.972
Preliminary time of death:
Between ten and 12 hours ago.

10:24.155 --> 10:25.409
We have another body!

10:30.835 --> 10:32.164
I thought you said you had another body.

10:32.188 --> 10:33.188
I do.

10:33.605 --> 10:34.648
Actually, ten of them.

11:04.840 --> 11:05.840
Hey, what time is it?

11:07.362 --> 11:08.052
After 10:00.

11:08.312 --> 11:09.312
After 10:00?

11:09.672 --> 11:11.793
I missed my class. Why
didn't you wake me?

11:13.675 --> 11:15.305
I wanted you to get some rest before...

11:17.376 --> 11:18.376
Before what?

11:21.319 --> 11:22.340
Sarah...

11:23.675 --> 11:24.675
You found my taxi.

11:26.194 --> 11:27.986
I haven't spoken to
the driver yet, but...

11:29.008 --> 11:30.683
I did get a log from the company.

11:32.287 --> 11:33.287
And?

11:34.851 --> 11:36.403
And you were picked up

11:36.427 --> 11:38.300
early this morning at the quad.

11:40.666 --> 11:42.790
When I went to check
it out, NCIS was there.

11:45.308 --> 11:46.697
What was NCIS doing there?

11:49.587 --> 11:51.541
Probably had something
to do with the dead body.

11:54.229 --> 11:55.229
Where are you going?

11:55.376 --> 11:56.832
The library. I have to study.

11:57.137 --> 11:58.137
Excuse me?

11:58.432 --> 12:00.120
I have a Chaucer midterm coming up.

12:00.144 --> 12:00.872
Hey, Sarah!

12:01.075 --> 12:02.206
Hello! Dead guy!

12:02.429 --> 12:04.192
That's probably dead
guy's blood on your shirt.

12:04.216 --> 12:05.776
I told you, that could be animal blood.

12:06.049 --> 12:07.797
It's not. I tested it, and it's human.

12:09.002 --> 12:10.659
Sarah, we've got to go to NCIS.

12:11.520 --> 12:12.936
Why? Why NCIS?

12:14.629 --> 12:15.629
Body was a sailor.

12:20.584 --> 12:21.584
Sarah!

12:21.668 --> 12:22.668
Hey!

12:32.637 --> 12:33.837
Do you know the sailor's name?

12:35.639 --> 12:36.639
No.

12:39.886 --> 12:40.886
I do.

12:44.631 --> 12:47.414
Dental records confirm the
body is Seaman Jeff Petty,

12:47.438 --> 12:49.219
currently serving on the USS Enterprise.

12:49.243 --> 12:50.425
Docked at Norfolk last night.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.513
- Navy notifying the family?
- As we speak.

12:52.537 --> 12:54.252
A duty I do not envy.

12:55.278 --> 12:57.159
Yes, when I was an
officer with the regiment,

12:57.183 --> 12:59.965
I was twice called upon
to render such services.

13:00.130 --> 13:02.375
I prefer combat to telling a family

13:02.399 --> 13:05.006
that one of their loved ones
shall never be returning.

13:05.073 --> 13:09.039
Luckily, in this case,
we are spared such a duty.

13:09.105 --> 13:10.745
You got a time of
death on those goldfish?

13:11.085 --> 13:12.851
No time, but a cause.

13:13.147 --> 13:14.147
Asphyxiation.

13:15.423 --> 13:16.423
Suffocation?

13:17.659 --> 13:18.659
Over-feeding.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.106
Nicotine poisoning.

13:21.933 --> 13:23.815
I just got the test results from Abby.

13:23.904 --> 13:26.351
There was enough nicotine
in their blood to kill...

13:26.454 --> 13:28.103
well, to kill a gold fish.

13:28.372 --> 13:29.676
That much is certain.

13:29.810 --> 13:30.810
How did that get there?

13:31.464 --> 13:32.938
Your guess is as good as mine.

13:33.273 --> 13:35.879
Yeah, the cause of death of Seaman Petty

13:35.903 --> 13:37.356
is more explicable.

13:37.781 --> 13:40.584
Sharp-force trauma
to the thoracic area.

13:40.608 --> 13:43.805
Punctured the aorta, so death
was almost instantaneous.

13:43.869 --> 13:46.477
The shape and depth of
the wound suggests...

13:46.549 --> 13:47.391
- a combat knife.
- A combat knife.

13:47.436 --> 13:48.486
We didn't find a knife.

13:48.746 --> 13:50.162
All we bagged was trash.

13:50.350 --> 13:51.510
Tell DiNozzo to keep looking.

13:52.959 --> 13:54.804
Well, Tony went home.

13:56.597 --> 13:57.597
He went home?

13:58.052 --> 13:59.172
He wasn't feeling well.

13:59.531 --> 14:01.058
Thought McGee might
have gotten him sick.

14:01.082 --> 14:02.082
So he went...

14:03.000 --> 14:03.591
home?

14:03.952 --> 14:04.955
Well, actually...

14:06.407 --> 14:08.200
the Director told him he could go.

14:10.754 --> 14:11.811
I'm not done, Gibbs.

14:11.838 --> 14:13.195
Make it fast, Dr. Mallard.

14:13.219 --> 14:14.435
Postmortem lividity

14:14.459 --> 14:17.383
suggests that Seaman
Petty was killed on scene.

14:17.407 --> 14:20.352
Tox screen came back negative;
No drugs in his system.

14:20.423 --> 14:22.322
His CO said he was a model sailor.

14:22.367 --> 14:25.455
There was very little trauma
beyond the entry wound.

14:25.580 --> 14:29.305
No scratches, no DNA in the fingernails.

14:30.335 --> 14:31.382
He was surprised.

14:32.128 --> 14:33.128
Or he knew his killer.

14:37.555 --> 14:38.636
Sarah, open up.

14:40.796 --> 14:41.796
Sarah!

14:43.343 --> 14:44.925
Tell me how you know this guy!

14:46.884 --> 14:49.240
Sarah, I can't help you
unless you talk to me.

14:58.118 --> 14:59.118
How do you know him?

15:02.341 --> 15:03.341
We used to date.

15:10.608 --> 15:12.845
Until he started seeing my old roommate.

15:13.508 --> 15:14.508
And?

15:15.409 --> 15:16.409
And...

15:19.439 --> 15:22.169
I threatened to kill him once or twice.

15:24.805 --> 15:26.137
Maybe even three times.

15:32.323 --> 15:34.529
This is that sailor that
you were dating last year?

15:36.429 --> 15:37.709
You told me you didn't like him.

15:38.178 --> 15:39.939
What did you expect me to say, Tim?

15:40.504 --> 15:42.893
I really liked this guy
and he just broke my heart

15:42.917 --> 15:44.987
when he dumped me for
some skanky cheerleader.

15:45.229 --> 15:46.134
You threatened to kill him

15:46.158 --> 15:47.758
because he dumped you for a cheerleader?

15:47.991 --> 15:48.797
I didn't mean it.

15:48.821 --> 15:50.781
It was just one of those
things you say, you know?

15:53.473 --> 15:55.128
Did anyone hear you say it?

15:56.912 --> 15:58.346
I never actually said it.

16:00.745 --> 16:01.745
I e-mailed it.

16:03.815 --> 16:05.304
Sarah, we got to go to Gibbs now.

16:05.639 --> 16:07.505
I haven't done anything wrong.

16:07.693 --> 16:08.693
How do you know?

16:09.639 --> 16:10.639
Tim, you don't really...

16:15.014 --> 16:15.686
You do.

16:15.883 --> 16:17.654
Sober, no, but you were drinking, Sarah.

16:17.678 --> 16:18.773
There could have been an accident.

16:18.797 --> 16:20.299
Tim, I swear on my life...

16:20.335 --> 16:21.474
How can you swear?!

16:22.101 --> 16:23.603
You don't remember what happened.

16:25.629 --> 16:26.934
If my own brother doesn't believe me,

16:26.958 --> 16:28.288
who the hell is going to?

16:30.713 --> 16:31.713
Sarah.

16:32.542 --> 16:33.742
What, are you gonna arrest me?

16:35.510 --> 16:36.890
You need to understand something.

16:39.275 --> 16:41.234
Our only option right
now is going to N...

16:49.272 --> 16:49.972
Wait a minute.

16:50.285 --> 16:51.845
I thought they were brother and sister.

16:52.029 --> 16:53.589
They are, but they don't know it.

16:54.262 --> 16:55.988
Haven't you been reading the subtitles?

16:56.203 --> 16:57.203
There are subtitles?

16:59.054 --> 17:00.910
So much for being a film buff.

17:01.026 --> 17:02.999
Hey! Listen, I could...

17:03.375 --> 17:04.228
bore you to death

17:04.252 --> 17:07.271
with a lecture on German
Expressionism in film if you'd like.

17:07.751 --> 17:09.028
You could never bore me.

17:09.064 --> 17:10.511
Well, that is very sweet of you,

17:10.535 --> 17:11.790
but you underestimate me.

17:12.355 --> 17:14.042
It is my contention, Miss Benoit,

17:14.067 --> 17:16.354
that the abstract nature
of Expressionism in film...

17:20.209 --> 17:21.454
What are we doing, Tony?

17:21.894 --> 17:25.291
Well, I'm boring you with
German Expressionism in film.

17:26.273 --> 17:28.838
We've been dating for over a month.

17:30.138 --> 17:32.205
Don't you find it a
little curious that...

17:32.689 --> 17:34.366
we haven't taken it to the next level?

17:35.469 --> 17:37.504
You mean Italian Neo-Realism?

17:37.786 --> 17:38.874
- Japanese cinema?
- No.

17:38.898 --> 17:39.898
Sex...

17:42.287 --> 17:43.287
Yeah...

17:43.856 --> 17:44.816
Yeah, sex, right.

17:44.869 --> 17:45.882
Yeah, is that

17:46.394 --> 17:47.972
something you might be interested in?

17:51.078 --> 17:51.598
Yeah.

17:51.706 --> 17:53.391
Yeah, I get that vibe from you,

17:54.620 --> 17:56.390
and yet we still haven't had it

17:56.414 --> 17:59.071
and you don't seem like
the type who usually waits.

18:01.537 --> 18:03.249
Yeah, well, it could be

18:03.273 --> 18:04.787
because you remind me of my sister.

18:05.486 --> 18:06.939
You said you were an only child.

18:07.602 --> 18:08.602
I am.

18:11.005 --> 18:12.421
Could I have a serious answer...

18:14.120 --> 18:15.120
please?

18:19.173 --> 18:20.293
I don't want to rush things.

18:21.244 --> 18:23.606
Date Two is rushing things, Tony.

18:25.260 --> 18:29.317
Date 11, that's a violation
of the Geneva Convention.

18:32.724 --> 18:34.616
If you always do what
you've always done,

18:35.800 --> 18:37.557
then you'll always get
what you always got.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.753
And while what I got had its perks,

18:44.138 --> 18:45.922
I'm looking for something different now.

18:47.881 --> 18:48.881
Okay, Tony,

18:49.925 --> 18:50.925
but just so you know,

18:53.700 --> 18:54.754
whenever you're ready...

18:57.255 --> 18:58.255
so am I.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.183
And then when we finished bowling,

19:11.207 --> 19:12.340
he walked me to my car.

19:12.627 --> 19:13.299
And?

19:13.506 --> 19:16.378
And he said, "I hope to
see you soon, baby doll,"

19:16.402 --> 19:18.284
gave me a peck on the
cheek and then he left.

19:18.320 --> 19:19.566
Short and sweet.

19:19.602 --> 19:20.602
Oh, he is.

19:20.822 --> 19:22.902
Hey, I've been looking all
over the building for you.

19:23.152 --> 19:24.282
Since we were low on agents,

19:24.306 --> 19:25.411
I thought I'd give Abby a hand.

19:25.435 --> 19:27.846
The only reason we are
low on agents is because

19:27.870 --> 19:29.206
you sent DiNozzo home.

19:29.276 --> 19:31.464
Well, there's no sense
in getting us all sick.

19:31.488 --> 19:32.925
Next time you send one of my team home,

19:32.949 --> 19:34.699
you clear it with me first, Director!

19:34.723 --> 19:36.377
Oh, I didn't know I
needed your permission

19:36.404 --> 19:38.613
to manage my own personnel Agent Gibbs.

19:38.637 --> 19:39.637
Your personnel?

19:39.668 --> 19:40.555
Last time I checked it said.

19:40.579 --> 19:42.299
Director on my door, not yours.

19:42.999 --> 19:45.052
The kids don't like it
when Mommy and Daddy fight.

19:46.805 --> 19:48.018
You got the call log

19:48.042 --> 19:49.905
off the cell phone we
found on Seaman Petty?

19:49.970 --> 19:52.973
There was damage on the
DC run to the SIM chip,

19:52.997 --> 19:54.172
probably from the fall.

19:56.438 --> 19:59.898
Okay. Wow, 15 missed text messages.

19:59.922 --> 20:01.670
Someone's really trying
to get a hold of...

20:03.616 --> 20:05.096
Oh, no, what do I do? Do I answer it?

20:05.767 --> 20:06.767
Put it on speaker.

20:08.143 --> 20:09.143
Hello.

20:09.354 --> 20:10.805
Finally. Where the hell are you?

20:12.644 --> 20:13.644
McGee?

20:14.538 --> 20:15.538
Boss?

20:16.134 --> 20:17.772
Why do you have my sister's cell phone?

20:18.044 --> 20:19.622
I got a better question for you.

20:19.703 --> 20:22.439
Why is your sister's phone
doing on my dead body?

20:41.558 --> 20:42.664
Ooh, and I thought being sent

20:42.688 --> 20:44.132
to the principal's office was bad.

20:44.661 --> 20:45.746
He's still in the elevator?

20:45.988 --> 20:48.220
Per Gibb's orders.
Awaiting El Jefe's arrival.

20:49.188 --> 20:49.965
How mad is he?

20:50.202 --> 20:52.811
Well, considering McGee's
been covering for his sister

20:52.873 --> 20:54.793
who's implicated in the
death of a Navy sailor...

20:57.800 --> 20:59.244
What were you thinking, McGee?!

20:59.450 --> 21:01.050
I'd say he's handling it pretty well.

21:02.597 --> 21:04.892
I would apologize, but I
know how you feel about that.

21:09.944 --> 21:10.944
You got your voice back.

21:11.715 --> 21:12.522
I never lost it.

21:12.603 --> 21:13.603
No kidding?

21:17.426 --> 21:20.540
I know withholding evidence
is a violation of NCIS policy.

21:20.564 --> 21:21.564
And a crime.

21:22.604 --> 21:24.021
One that I don't really care about.

21:25.796 --> 21:27.006
Why didn't you come to me?

21:30.117 --> 21:31.117
I was going to.

21:31.713 --> 21:34.076
When I saw the body, I-I
know I had to bring Sarah in.

21:34.112 --> 21:35.618
No, before that.

21:37.873 --> 21:38.993
I couldn't take that chance.

21:45.059 --> 21:47.238
I don't know what my
sister did or didn't do.

21:50.300 --> 21:51.540
But I know what it looked like.

21:52.819 --> 21:55.880
And we say, 'better
ten guilty men go free

21:55.904 --> 21:57.212
than one innocent get punished,

21:57.236 --> 21:58.254
but I know from experience

21:58.278 --> 21:59.758
it doesn't always work out like that.

22:02.309 --> 22:03.869
I couldn't take that chance with Sarah.

22:05.196 --> 22:08.756
Not with the police, not with NCIS.

22:10.612 --> 22:11.612
Not even with you.

22:16.430 --> 22:17.430
She's my sister.

22:28.194 --> 22:29.700
Apology accepted.

22:39.046 --> 22:40.046
Cute girl.

22:40.149 --> 22:42.466
Hey. This is the one I
found on McGee's iPod.

22:42.659 --> 22:44.699
I knew there was no way
she could be his girlfriend.

22:45.187 --> 22:47.046
Poor McGee got the shallow
end of the gene pool.

22:47.070 --> 22:48.070
They're here.

22:49.177 --> 22:50.848
I thought for sure
probie would be limping.

22:50.872 --> 22:53.064
Getting, uh, soft, in
your old age there, boss?

22:53.718 --> 22:55.199
Prime of your youth, sir?

22:56.148 --> 22:57.332
We needed it for the BOLO.

22:57.601 --> 22:58.841
Please tell me that's not for..

22:59.013 --> 23:00.994
Citing a bench warrant
for Grand Theft Auto.

23:01.129 --> 23:02.790
Guess that's better
than a BOLO for murder.

23:02.814 --> 23:03.894
We need to find her, McGee.

23:03.989 --> 23:05.510
Right now, she's our main suspect.

23:05.534 --> 23:06.256
Witness.

23:06.280 --> 23:08.530
Spoke to the taxi driver
who picked your sister up.

23:09.713 --> 23:11.112
He places her at the crime scene.

23:11.229 --> 23:13.039
And Abby confirmed the blood type

23:13.063 --> 23:15.257
on your sister's clothes,
matches Seaman Petty.

23:15.281 --> 23:16.542
That's more than witness, probie.

23:16.566 --> 23:17.692
And there are the emails.

23:17.716 --> 23:19.598
Like the one that
starts "Dear man whore"

23:19.622 --> 23:21.941
and ends with "if I ever see
you again I will kill you.

23:21.965 --> 23:23.077
Love, Sarah."

23:23.521 --> 23:25.199
Got them off Seaman Petty's e-mail.

23:25.377 --> 23:27.038
Throw them on the pile
and they add up to...

23:27.062 --> 23:28.627
Motive and opportunity.

23:29.990 --> 23:30.990
Why is she running?

23:32.182 --> 23:34.047
She's mad. She's scared.

23:34.396 --> 23:35.638
Says she has nothing
to do with the murder.

23:35.662 --> 23:36.742
Thinks I don't believe her.

23:37.481 --> 23:38.481
Do you?

23:38.583 --> 23:39.633
Sarah's not a killer.

23:40.305 --> 23:40.592
But?

23:40.959 --> 23:42.332
But an accident's another story.

23:42.582 --> 23:44.232
- If she was drugged...
- She wasn't.

23:44.653 --> 23:46.128
Abby ran the urine sample you took,

23:46.152 --> 23:47.366
and it was clean.

23:48.177 --> 23:49.307
Any other suspects?

23:49.459 --> 23:51.440
Maybe Seaman Petty's
cheerleader girlfriend.

23:51.709 --> 23:53.176
At least your sister's not the only one

23:53.200 --> 23:54.223
writing threatening e-mails.

23:54.247 --> 23:55.332
Cheerleader was worried.

23:55.358 --> 23:57.232
Popeye was getting his
spinach somewhere else.

23:57.403 --> 23:57.887
Address?

23:58.416 --> 24:00.232
Ziva, I want that taxi impounded.

24:00.379 --> 24:01.756
DiNozzo, you're on McGee's sister.

24:01.791 --> 24:03.199
Ah, with great pleasure, boss.

24:03.473 --> 24:04.834
Boss, maybe Tony would
be better on the taxi...

24:04.858 --> 24:05.835
- McGee...
- Yeah.

24:05.880 --> 24:06.346
Go home.

24:06.859 --> 24:08.259
I can't have you working this case.

24:08.715 --> 24:10.955
If I go home, how do you know
I won't keep working on it?

24:14.373 --> 24:15.215
Come on.

24:15.305 --> 24:16.327
I'll keep an eye on you.

24:20.075 --> 24:21.075
Hey.

24:21.474 --> 24:22.714
You're wondering if she did it?

24:23.365 --> 24:25.732
No, I'm wondering why McGee
never told me he had a sister.

24:41.701 --> 24:43.593
This is Jeff in Bahrain.

24:45.444 --> 24:46.260
Handsome kid.

24:46.417 --> 24:47.966
He loved wearing that uniform.

24:48.381 --> 24:50.438
Almost as much as I
loved seeing him in it.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.764
He was supposed to meet
me at the food court.

24:52.788 --> 24:55.547
We were having freshman
cheerleader initiations

24:55.571 --> 24:56.571
later that night.

24:56.827 --> 24:59.185
But I wanted to make time
to surprise Jeff with...

25:00.682 --> 25:01.682
a surprise.

25:03.044 --> 25:04.044
He never showed?

25:05.205 --> 25:06.918
I just figured his ship was late.

25:09.482 --> 25:11.002
I told you we should have used carbon.

25:11.185 --> 25:12.578
If you can't get this thing working,

25:12.602 --> 25:14.467
I'm going to have to
find some geeks who can.

25:14.888 --> 25:15.888
No, we can do it.

25:19.591 --> 25:20.218
Seen enough?

25:20.398 --> 25:22.076
No, no, no, actually, um...

25:22.100 --> 25:24.473
I was checking the water gun here.

25:24.751 --> 25:27.068
The check valve is on backwards.

25:27.283 --> 25:28.283
If you flip this...

25:29.199 --> 25:30.462
Real smooth, Einstein.

25:31.771 --> 25:34.667
It sounds like you and Jeff
had a perfect relationship.

25:36.218 --> 25:37.218
We did.

25:37.661 --> 25:38.821
We were going to get married.

25:41.727 --> 25:43.243
You better make her pay for this.

25:44.516 --> 25:45.516
Who?

25:45.672 --> 25:47.633
That jealous bitch, Sarah McGee.

25:48.096 --> 25:49.402
She couldn't deal
with the fact that Jeff

25:49.426 --> 25:50.624
wanted me instead of her.

25:50.648 --> 25:52.495
She sent him threatening e-mails,

25:52.519 --> 25:54.082
she trashed me in her blog.

25:54.575 --> 25:55.575
Blog?

25:56.037 --> 25:56.404
Yeah.

25:56.969 --> 25:57.969
What's a blog?

25:58.978 --> 26:01.199
It's a... blog. You know.

26:01.416 --> 26:02.491
No, I don't know.

26:02.515 --> 26:02.936
It's...

26:03.142 --> 26:05.747
something losers put online
so that everyone can read.

26:05.845 --> 26:07.334
Are you going to arrest her or not?

26:08.392 --> 26:09.297
I saw her

26:09.342 --> 26:10.869
at the food court with her geek friends.

26:10.893 --> 26:12.734
When she found out that
Jeff was coming to meet me,

26:12.758 --> 26:13.799
she left to find him.

26:14.471 --> 26:15.702
How do you know she just didn't leave?

26:15.726 --> 26:17.501
Because she killed him!

26:17.994 --> 26:18.994
- Boss...
- Hey.

26:19.866 --> 26:21.823
I told you to wait outside.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.373
Why didn't you ask
her about the e-mails?

26:23.397 --> 26:24.700
Maybe I don't want her to know

26:24.724 --> 26:26.947
that I know about the e-mails, McGee.

26:28.372 --> 26:29.372
There's a reason

26:29.618 --> 26:31.120
I told you to stay outside.

26:31.183 --> 26:32.734
And there's a reason that I came in.

26:34.025 --> 26:35.025
Look.

26:47.102 --> 26:48.102
Come on in.

26:57.081 --> 26:58.820
I take it this isn't a social call.

27:00.667 --> 27:01.667
I need some advice.

27:03.353 --> 27:04.353
And you came to me?

27:04.715 --> 27:06.195
Well, it was either you or Gibbs,

27:06.849 --> 27:09.481
and his track record
with women sucks, so...

27:14.488 --> 27:15.927
I'm finding, um...

27:16.904 --> 27:19.365
myself in a particularly
odd situation with...

27:20.114 --> 27:21.114
someone...

27:21.822 --> 27:22.822
special.

27:23.660 --> 27:24.660
Odd?

27:25.561 --> 27:26.825
Odd, yeah, odd.

27:27.112 --> 27:28.112
Because, uh...

27:28.888 --> 27:31.415
we've been going out for, uh...

27:31.803 --> 27:33.696
over a month, and, we... we haven't...

27:34.442 --> 27:35.811
done something

27:36.428 --> 27:39.795
that I usually do... you
know, a lot earlier than that.

27:40.046 --> 27:43.090
And may I ask what it is
that's holding you back

27:43.176 --> 27:46.058
from doing what you usually do?

27:48.005 --> 27:49.005
Yeah.

27:49.411 --> 27:50.411
Um...

27:52.336 --> 27:53.627
Because of the...

27:54.344 --> 27:55.805
particular importance...

27:56.253 --> 27:57.355
of this person,

27:57.696 --> 27:59.896
I thought it would be a good
idea to take things slowly.

28:01.110 --> 28:04.139
Which is kind of a new
concept for me. But...

28:04.953 --> 28:08.664
at a certain point, things
have to speed up, righ... right?

28:09.625 --> 28:10.886
Are you attracted to her?

28:13.243 --> 28:14.243
Oh, yeah.

28:14.820 --> 28:15.820
Yeah.

28:16.330 --> 28:17.330
I could make a meal.

28:18.195 --> 28:19.292
Is she attracted to you?

28:21.654 --> 28:22.903
So what's the problem?

28:29.821 --> 28:30.377
DiNozzo.

28:30.646 --> 28:32.340
BOLO just came back on McGee's sister.

28:32.528 --> 28:33.653
Campus security has her.

28:33.823 --> 28:35.969
Well, let Gibbs know.
He's there with McGee.

28:36.184 --> 28:36.708
I did.

28:37.165 --> 28:38.285
He wants us to bring her in.

28:38.688 --> 28:39.782
Okay, I'll be right there.

28:42.493 --> 28:43.493
Good luck.

28:45.042 --> 28:46.378
I'm Security Officer Tate.

28:46.674 --> 28:48.425
One of the librarians reported her.

28:48.492 --> 28:50.330
Apparently, she sleeps here a lot.

28:50.366 --> 28:51.607
How McGee-ish of her.

28:51.723 --> 28:52.946
Must be in the McGee-nome.

28:53.233 --> 28:55.200
You want her for more
than GTA, don't you?

28:57.915 --> 28:59.437
I didn't have the
authority to arrest her,

28:59.461 --> 29:01.541
- but if you want me to...
- We'll take it from here.

29:10.608 --> 29:12.222
No, you can't have my number.

29:13.266 --> 29:14.826
I already have have your number, Sarah.

29:19.619 --> 29:20.685
It's not whays think.

29:22.186 --> 29:23.714
My eyes water when I read a lot,

29:23.741 --> 29:25.141
and these lights are really crappy.

29:29.606 --> 29:30.846
Are you guys here to arrest me?

29:31.497 --> 29:31.883
No.

29:32.250 --> 29:33.570
You do have to come with us, now.

29:34.329 --> 29:35.329
Yeah, sure.

29:37.931 --> 29:40.334
You are just being nice to me
'cause Tim's my big brother?

29:41.108 --> 29:43.264
No. I'm always nice to hot girls.

29:46.655 --> 29:48.080
You must be Tommy.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.021
Tony.

29:50.169 --> 29:52.001
Sorry. In Tim's book, you're Tommy.

29:53.287 --> 29:54.470
Which would make you Lisa?

30:11.758 --> 30:12.758
Where have you been?

30:12.914 --> 30:14.653
The library. I told you Io study.

30:15.586 --> 30:16.669
You know, Tony

30:16.693 --> 30:18.117
is much cuter than Tommy.

30:19.582 --> 30:20.582
Tommy?

30:20.899 --> 30:21.437
Hmm,

30:21.616 --> 30:24.202
you know if you rearrange
these letters, you get...

30:24.686 --> 30:25.716
Timothy McGee.

30:26.513 --> 30:28.231
You should have told
me this was a secret.

30:28.467 --> 30:30.142
Can't wait to read
about your swashbuckling,

30:30.166 --> 30:31.664
and socially repugnant,

30:31.733 --> 30:33.732
Special Agent Tommy.

30:34.964 --> 30:39.072
And Lisa... the sultry
and emotionally distant

30:39.507 --> 30:40.323
Mossad officer.

30:40.377 --> 30:43.560
Or their boss... L.J. Tibbs, who drinks

30:43.584 --> 30:47.181
to alleviate the burden
of his messianic complex."

30:47.813 --> 30:48.813
Where is L.J.,

30:48.888 --> 30:49.888
Dead-Agent-Walking?

30:50.116 --> 30:51.232
Evidence garage.

30:52.948 --> 30:53.948
Tony?

30:54.418 --> 30:55.418
Tony?

30:56.636 --> 30:57.661
I'm going to kill you.

30:59.127 --> 31:00.265
Where'd you find it, Abs?

31:00.399 --> 31:01.811
Stuffed behind the seat cushion.

31:02.895 --> 31:03.895
Hey, boss.

31:09.733 --> 31:11.088
You okay?

31:12.747 --> 31:15.229
Sarah, please, no!

31:18.929 --> 31:20.588
You didn't find that
in the taxi, did you?

31:33.235 --> 31:35.516
Who studies while they wait
to be interrogated for murder?

31:36.121 --> 31:36.703
A Mc-Geek.

31:37.125 --> 31:39.697
"Lisa's eyes reminded him of emeralds."

31:39.823 --> 31:40.361
Oh.

31:40.450 --> 31:42.211
"Flawed only by the
icicles in her heart."

31:42.891 --> 31:43.891
He's dead.

31:45.141 --> 31:50.133
"And the Field Agent Tommy is
a dogged pursuer of dirtbags."

31:50.482 --> 31:51.482
Yep.

31:53.004 --> 31:55.908
"And any skirt over the age of 18."

31:56.105 --> 31:57.109
Your brother's dead.

31:57.602 --> 32:00.900
Sarah threatened to kill
Seaman Petty by e-mail.

32:01.124 --> 32:03.933
A taxi picked her up
near the crime scene

32:03.960 --> 32:05.304
at the time of the murder.

32:05.555 --> 32:07.168
The blood on her clothes

32:07.303 --> 32:11.138
matches the victim's and her
fingerprints are on the murder weapon.

32:11.806 --> 32:13.355
Other than being your sister,

32:13.857 --> 32:15.653
is there any evidentiary reason

32:15.677 --> 32:17.362
why she shouldn't be charged?

32:18.213 --> 32:20.023
But she is my sister, Director.

32:21.429 --> 32:22.384
Sarah may have a temper,

32:22.408 --> 32:24.965
but she lashes out with her
mouth or a pen, not a knife.

32:25.073 --> 32:26.788
And I hope you have more to offer

32:26.812 --> 32:28.881
than brotherly love, Agent McGee.

32:30.328 --> 32:31.328
She was drugged.

32:31.601 --> 32:33.142
She showed up at my door groggy,

32:33.473 --> 32:36.596
barely able to walk. She couldn't remember
anything except leaving the food court.

32:36.620 --> 32:39.697
And the lab reports for drugs
and alcohol were negative.

32:40.907 --> 32:42.148
By the time those tests were taken,

32:42.172 --> 32:43.900
whatever was in her
system had metabolized.

32:43.924 --> 32:45.589
And if that's true, whose fault is that?

32:47.964 --> 32:49.248
Mine, I should have taken.

32:49.272 --> 32:51.131
- Sarah in earlier.
- But you didn't bring her in.

32:51.155 --> 32:53.390
Agent DiNozzo and Officer David did.

32:53.839 --> 32:56.773
So your actions, or
should I say inactions,

32:57.140 --> 32:59.352
did nothing to help your sister,

32:59.376 --> 33:01.507
but it did impugn the
integrity of this agency.

33:01.531 --> 33:02.365
Forgive me, Director,

33:02.410 --> 33:06.143
for not putting the integrity
of NCIS before my sister.

33:08.678 --> 33:09.678
It won't happen again.

33:22.523 --> 33:23.523
McGee.

33:28.047 --> 33:29.047
Hey.

33:29.132 --> 33:30.826
Boss, don't try and talk me out of this.

33:31.368 --> 33:34.235
Never let someone manipulate
you like that again.

33:35.661 --> 33:36.964
Not even the Director.

33:40.163 --> 33:41.126
She wanted me to quit?

33:41.150 --> 33:43.923
That's her job, to protect
NCIS. Come here. Sit down.

33:46.122 --> 33:46.913
Boss, you don't think...?

33:46.937 --> 33:49.125
You sit down here until I get back.

33:55.005 --> 33:56.272
Boss, you don't think
Sarah did it, do you?

33:56.296 --> 33:57.613
I don't know, McGee.

33:59.096 --> 34:01.000
I'll know after I interrogate her.

34:01.153 --> 34:02.153
- Can I watch?
- No.

34:02.636 --> 34:03.996
- Please, from observation...
- No!

34:05.091 --> 34:06.238
Boss, I can't just sit here.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.714
Here, read a book.

34:32.483 --> 34:33.483
What's your major?

34:35.262 --> 34:36.262
English lit.

34:37.873 --> 34:39.822
You intend to be a
writer like your brother?

34:41.784 --> 34:42.949
I intend on being a writer.

34:43.860 --> 34:45.114
Why the smart-ass answer?

34:46.167 --> 34:47.167
What?

34:47.900 --> 34:48.940
You put your brother down.

34:49.120 --> 34:49.952
No, I didn't.

34:49.976 --> 34:50.976
Yeah, you did.

34:52.732 --> 34:54.179
He just resigned because of you.

34:56.137 --> 34:57.137
No!

34:58.830 --> 35:00.501
But Tim loves NCIS.

35:01.084 --> 35:02.696
Evidently, he loves you more.

35:11.487 --> 35:12.487
I'm sorry.

35:13.705 --> 35:15.090
Fake tears don't bother me.

35:15.114 --> 35:16.958
I don't fake tears.

35:18.948 --> 35:20.215
Just lapses in memory.

35:20.239 --> 35:21.430
I don't remember!

35:29.119 --> 35:30.119
I just get...

35:32.291 --> 35:33.788
quick film cuts.

35:34.397 --> 35:35.397
Hold onto 'em.

35:35.450 --> 35:36.450
I can't.

35:36.848 --> 35:37.913
I guess you don't want to.

35:37.949 --> 35:38.747
I do.

35:38.809 --> 35:40.701
If you did, you'd remember.

35:42.556 --> 35:43.556
And how would you know?

35:46.418 --> 35:47.418
I've been there.

35:55.388 --> 35:57.333
Sarah, stop it! Stop it!

35:57.477 --> 35:59.040
What are you doing?!

36:01.841 --> 36:03.951
No! No! No!

36:09.327 --> 36:10.327
I stabbed him!

36:11.541 --> 36:12.827
I stabbed Jeff!

36:19.785 --> 36:21.309
What's your sister's favorite pizza?

36:21.990 --> 36:23.231
What? Her favorite pizza?

36:23.255 --> 36:24.761
Come on, Tim, it's not a trick question.

36:24.785 --> 36:28.308
Uh, cheeseless with pickles,
Tabasco and peanut butter.

36:28.353 --> 36:30.486
Yes, yes, yes!

36:30.557 --> 36:31.107
Yes?

36:31.131 --> 36:32.131
You sister was doped.

36:32.394 --> 36:33.482
Where's Gibbs? Where's everybody?

36:33.506 --> 36:34.249
Interrogation.

36:34.273 --> 36:36.073
Well, go get 'em and
bring 'em down to my lab.

36:36.104 --> 36:37.104
There's more!

36:42.296 --> 36:43.426
Abby's got great news.

36:43.820 --> 36:45.612
It's not great. It's actually terrible,

36:45.636 --> 36:47.646
but it explains why Sarah...

36:49.116 --> 36:50.605
What did Gibbs do to my sister?

36:50.761 --> 36:51.281
Nothing.

36:51.729 --> 36:53.418
She admitted stabbing Seaman Petty.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.740
Sarah doesn't know what she's saying.

37:01.304 --> 37:01.868
McGee...

37:01.904 --> 37:03.934
Boss, she was drugged. Abby has proof.

37:06.730 --> 37:07.730
Stay with her.

37:08.871 --> 37:09.871
Hey, hey.

37:10.126 --> 37:11.318
I remember the knife.

37:12.205 --> 37:13.993
I remember Jeff lying there.

37:14.029 --> 37:16.233
No, no, my little sister
could never kill anyone.

37:20.947 --> 37:23.483
I was poring over all
the forensic evidence:

37:23.518 --> 37:26.286
The trash from the crime scene
and every inch of the taxi

37:26.310 --> 37:28.815
and I realized that the floor
mat smells like Nilosorb.

37:29.084 --> 37:30.084
Nilosorb?

37:32.021 --> 37:33.329
Industrial vomit cleaner.

37:34.011 --> 37:35.788
So I took what was left on there.

37:35.812 --> 37:37.012
I ran it through the mass spec

37:37.390 --> 37:39.303
and found what McGee has confirmed

37:39.393 --> 37:41.338
to be Sarah's favorite
late-night snack:

37:41.566 --> 37:44.905
Cheeseless pizza with Tabasco,
pickles and peanut butter.

37:45.285 --> 37:45.715
Yuck.

37:45.751 --> 37:50.016
But I also found traces
of sodiumoxybate, aka GHB.

37:50.040 --> 37:51.677
It didn't show up in her urine sample

37:51.701 --> 37:53.204
because it metabolizes so quickly.

37:53.431 --> 37:55.772
Which is probably what makes it
such a popular date-rape drug.

37:55.796 --> 37:57.505
You think Seaman Petty
tried to rape her?

37:57.867 --> 37:58.569
Her ex-boyfriend?

37:58.593 --> 38:00.683
There's nothing like a death
threat from an ex-girlfriend

38:00.707 --> 38:01.707
to get your dander up.

38:01.760 --> 38:03.436
Are you talking from experience, Tony?

38:03.463 --> 38:05.471
So the levels of GHB

38:05.537 --> 38:08.471
allowed me to triangulate
a window of exposure.

38:08.539 --> 38:10.712
She was dosed at the food court.

38:10.838 --> 38:11.295
DiNozzo.

38:11.627 --> 38:13.448
Pull the security tapes from
the food court. On it, boss.

38:13.472 --> 38:13.902
Ziva.

38:13.965 --> 38:15.224
Names of food workers,

38:15.248 --> 38:17.138
janitors and anyone working that night.

38:17.684 --> 38:18.948
What was I going to tell you?

38:19.226 --> 38:21.058
I don't know. What were
you going to tell me,

38:21.094 --> 38:22.094
El Magnifico?

38:24.798 --> 38:25.798
Good job.

38:26.349 --> 38:27.349
But I have more.

38:27.389 --> 38:29.889
I solved the mystery
of the smoking goldfish.

38:30.440 --> 38:31.789
At first, I couldn't figure out

38:31.816 --> 38:33.980
how they were lighting
the cigarettes underwater,

38:34.553 --> 38:35.692
and then I found this.

38:36.651 --> 38:38.210
They were trying to kick the habit.

38:38.272 --> 38:42.242
Our little Nemos were swimming
in a bag that sprung a leak.

38:42.484 --> 38:45.065
Sprang a leak...
sprung, sprang, sprung...

38:45.585 --> 38:48.609
So their little lives flashed
before their eyes in a nicotine buzz.

38:48.986 --> 38:50.543
Hey, do you think,
since goldfish only have

38:50.567 --> 38:51.547
three seconds of memory...?

38:51.571 --> 38:52.838
Abby, get Ducky on that.

38:53.614 --> 38:54.614
I don't know, Gibbs.

38:55.084 --> 38:58.138
That is a very complicated
piece of equipment.

38:58.328 --> 38:59.984
Probably have to go get my manual out...

39:00.008 --> 39:01.008
Abbs!

39:04.901 --> 39:05.421
Ducky.

39:05.717 --> 39:08.138
Yes, my little lotus blossom.

39:08.266 --> 39:09.266
Gibbs wants you.

39:09.986 --> 39:11.266
You know when the goldfish died?

39:11.657 --> 39:14.638
I was just determining
the time they expired.

39:14.709 --> 39:17.021
You're using a little
teeny tiny liver probe?

39:17.236 --> 39:19.870
Being cold-blooded,
temperature is useless

39:19.894 --> 39:21.838
in determining the time of death.

39:21.959 --> 39:22.872
So you don't know?

39:22.963 --> 39:23.963
Au contraire.

39:24.338 --> 39:26.865
They died about the
same time as our victim.

39:28.379 --> 39:30.705
Now how did you calculate that?

39:30.906 --> 39:33.501
Track Sara McGee from the time
she enters until she leaves.

39:33.563 --> 39:35.042
Ah, okay.

39:36.234 --> 39:37.614
Ah-ah, oops.

39:38.658 --> 39:39.658
That was the wrong way.

39:42.772 --> 39:44.163
I'm sorry. Sorry, boss. One second.

39:44.187 --> 39:45.187
DiNozzo?

39:48.950 --> 39:49.950
Froze.

39:52.433 --> 39:53.467
This is sort of a McGeek thing.

39:53.491 --> 39:54.491
Get him.

39:57.376 --> 39:58.676
You know what a clog is?

40:00.584 --> 40:02.700
A shoe or a block to drain?

40:02.825 --> 40:03.825
On the Internet.

40:04.241 --> 40:05.702
I thought that was a blog,

40:05.881 --> 40:08.201
but, uh, my English is often wrong.

40:08.497 --> 40:09.788
Sarah McGee wrote a blog

40:09.833 --> 40:11.454
trashing her and the cheerleaders.

40:11.478 --> 40:12.270
Do you think you can find it?

40:12.337 --> 40:13.641
Probably on MySpace.

40:14.009 --> 40:14.815
Who is she?

40:14.986 --> 40:17.584
- Seaman Petty's girlfriend, Sarah's ex.
- Roommate.

40:21.993 --> 40:24.846
"These peppy little girls
all skanked up to the nines

40:24.870 --> 40:26.838
"in their adorable
cheerleading uniforms,

40:26.904 --> 40:29.637
"which had been mistakenly
ordered in children's sizes,

40:29.843 --> 40:34.148
"were engaged in strangely
homoerotic, adderol-fueled

40:34.172 --> 40:36.958
spastic movements that
they called dance routine."

40:37.030 --> 40:38.030
Where's that from?

40:38.195 --> 40:39.195
That's my blog.

40:41.152 --> 40:43.872
You should let your sister
ghostwrite for you, probie.

40:43.917 --> 40:45.584
Find your sister
entering the food court.

40:46.247 --> 40:48.706
How do you get a
ready-made cheeseless pizza

40:48.730 --> 40:51.604
with Tabasco sauce,
pickles and peanut butter?

40:52.018 --> 40:53.367
Oh, I make it myself.

40:53.887 --> 40:55.548
Food court has everything
but peanut butter,

40:55.572 --> 40:57.073
so I carry a jar in my backpack.

40:57.189 --> 40:58.864
McGee, isolate her table.

41:08.310 --> 41:09.310
Ready?

41:09.385 --> 41:11.178
One, two, down, up.

41:12.034 --> 41:14.323
Steady. Hold it, Heather.

41:14.538 --> 41:15.950
Uh! Take five.

41:22.214 --> 41:23.487
Whatever happened to quitting?

41:23.819 --> 41:24.952
After football season.

41:27.766 --> 41:28.766
Why don't you go home?

41:30.132 --> 41:31.251
I'd rather be here.

41:36.139 --> 41:37.271
Seen enough of my ass?

41:38.103 --> 41:38.963
What do you think, Tony?

41:39.106 --> 41:40.506
I don't know. There's a lot to see.

41:42.390 --> 41:43.842
Stay the hell away from me, jerk.

41:44.102 --> 41:45.885
It's amazing what a
college education does

41:45.909 --> 41:47.509
for a girl's vocabulary,
don't you think?

41:47.633 --> 41:48.633
Astonishing.

41:49.833 --> 41:50.993
I believe you know my sister.

41:53.346 --> 41:55.210
That was for spiking my peanut butter.

41:56.299 --> 41:58.104
And that was for setting
me up to be raped.

41:58.472 --> 42:00.148
This is for being an
accessory to murder.

42:00.172 --> 42:00.501
What?

42:01.030 --> 42:01.760
Madison?

42:01.784 --> 42:03.852
They're framing me.
I didn't do anything.

42:03.876 --> 42:05.473
We got you starring
in the food court show.

42:05.497 --> 42:07.451
Spiking Sarah's peanut butter with GHB.

42:07.505 --> 42:09.300
Oh, yeah, try and prove
that from a security camera.

42:09.324 --> 42:11.891
Your greasy paw prints are
all over my peanut butter jar.

42:12.097 --> 42:14.342
We have you leaving the
food court with Officer Tate.

42:15.646 --> 42:16.793
You murdered Jeff?

42:16.946 --> 42:17.946
No!

42:18.213 --> 42:21.135
I was just using Tate to get
even for this bitch's blog.

42:21.690 --> 42:23.083
And Jeff saw Tate grappling with her

42:23.107 --> 42:24.107
and tried to play hero.

42:26.318 --> 42:27.056
I'm not gonna hurt you.

42:27.080 --> 42:28.771
What are you doing? Let go of her!

42:28.989 --> 42:29.989
Drop it!

42:35.504 --> 42:36.571
Tate stabbed him.

42:36.801 --> 42:38.095
I dropped everything and ran.

42:38.119 --> 42:39.830
You stabbed him! Put
the knife in her hand,

42:39.854 --> 42:41.111
put the cell phone in his pocket.

42:41.135 --> 42:42.178
You lying bastard!

42:42.202 --> 42:43.642
- Lying bitch!
- Get 'em out of here.

42:43.783 --> 42:45.469
- I didn't do anything!
- You have the right to remain silent,

42:45.493 --> 42:46.184
you have the right to do splits.

42:46.211 --> 42:47.211
Let go of me!

42:47.479 --> 42:48.799
The right to wear short skirts...

42:53.945 --> 42:54.945
I'm sorry.

42:57.337 --> 42:59.308
Jeff was a great guy
and he really loved you.

43:00.276 --> 43:01.276
How would you know?

43:02.937 --> 43:03.937
He e-mailed me.

43:05.062 --> 43:07.257
He said he was sorry,
but he met his soulmate.

43:08.368 --> 43:09.368
It was you.

43:20.866 --> 43:22.112
Sometimes, McGee...

43:24.463 --> 43:25.463
a little lie...

43:27.017 --> 43:28.415
it's good for the soul.
