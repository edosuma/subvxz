<i>Previously on</i> This Is Us...

00:04.340 --> 00:06.166
So is it still there?

00:06.191 --> 00:07.221
It's still there.

00:07.246 --> 00:09.552
Congratulations. You're
officially six weeks along.

00:09.586 --> 00:10.838
Is it always like this?

00:10.863 --> 00:13.206
It gets worse when
there's a lot going on.

00:13.231 --> 00:15.519
One of the things that helps me
when I'm feeling stressed, though,

00:15.543 --> 00:18.225
- is running.
- She told you what I said?

00:20.613 --> 00:22.247
<i>Let's all raise a glass</i>

00:22.282 --> 00:24.716
to my unemployed 28-year-old son.

00:24.894 --> 00:27.886
<i>My life,</i> before I met
you, Bec, it wasn't great.

00:27.910 --> 00:30.724
<i>I just tried to get away
from my father.</i>

00:30.749 --> 00:32.323
I've been working my ass off,

00:32.348 --> 00:34.621
and I am finally on the brink
of something special,

00:34.646 --> 00:37.014
<i>and I will be damned
if I let this stupid knee</i>

00:37.048 --> 00:38.856
<i>destroy another one of my dreams.</i>

00:40.819 --> 00:42.787
Stop!

00:42.821 --> 00:44.482
- Stop it, it's mine!
- Why can't you get it?

00:44.506 --> 00:45.465
It's mine!

00:45.490 --> 00:47.443
- You're gonna keep the boys safe?
- Oh, yeah. I will.

00:47.467 --> 00:49.326
- You have moisturizer for Randall?
- Check.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.920
And remember,
Kevin's afraid of bears.

00:50.944 --> 00:52.411
- So am I.
- Okay.

00:52.419 --> 00:53.963
Uh, the number for
the campground's by...

00:53.987 --> 00:55.354
By the phone in the kitchen.

00:55.389 --> 00:57.089
- I told you that already.
- Three times.

00:57.124 --> 00:59.018
- Okay.
- You really think that this trip

00:59.043 --> 01:00.825
is gonna help the boys get along better?

01:01.301 --> 01:02.022
I do.

01:02.047 --> 01:04.260
- Because Kevin can be so...
- Yep.

01:04.286 --> 01:06.183
And Randall is just
only trying to help.

01:06.208 --> 01:07.706
I know, baby. It's gonna be great.

01:07.731 --> 01:09.382
Look, camping's all about teamwork.

01:09.435 --> 01:11.079
Do you remember how the
Steelers were a wreck

01:11.103 --> 01:12.869
at the start of the '79 season?

01:14.017 --> 01:15.737
You're gonna Chuck Noll the boys?

01:15.762 --> 01:17.011
I'm gonna Chuck Noll the boys.

01:17.011 --> 01:18.883
- Okay. Good luck.
- Okay.

01:18.914 --> 01:20.885
- I'm gonna tell Mom or Dad!
- Stop!

01:20.910 --> 01:23.344
- Go get 'em, Coach.
- Oh!

01:24.547 --> 01:25.750
Oh, do you guys hear that?

01:25.775 --> 01:26.844
Do you know that sound?

01:27.095 --> 01:29.596
That is the call of the wild.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.141
- Hey, Kate!
- Come on, hop in the car.

01:31.165 --> 01:32.851
Your brothers are leaving.
Come say good-bye.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.635
Randall, put that up front for me.

01:34.669 --> 01:36.270
Thank you. Kev, here.

01:36.304 --> 01:38.438
We are gonna have the
best girl's day ever.

01:38.473 --> 01:39.873
- We are?
- Yeah.

01:39.907 --> 01:42.238
Can you say movies and manicures?

01:42.727 --> 01:44.578
I think the first thing we'll want to do

01:44.612 --> 01:47.352
- is set up the tent when we get there.
- Ugh!

01:50.703 --> 01:52.485
- Backseat.
- I'm already up here, Dad.

01:52.510 --> 01:54.236
Get in the backseat with your brother.

01:56.313 --> 01:58.076
Hey, and no Game Boy.

01:58.123 --> 01:59.038
What?

01:59.839 --> 02:02.105
Come on. There is no
Mario out in the wild.

02:03.239 --> 02:05.207
- Bye, guys. Good luck!
- Bye.

Hey.

02:57.202 --> 02:59.423
You kept my daughters up
way too late last night.

02:59.448 --> 03:00.892
Can't even get them out
of bed this morning.

03:00.896 --> 03:01.880
Oh, my gosh.

03:01.905 --> 03:03.516
Well, come on, dude.
I get, I get, like, what?

03:03.540 --> 03:05.514
One night with my nieces before
I got to go to Sophie's,

03:05.538 --> 03:06.778
- so sue me, okay?
- Okay.

03:06.803 --> 03:09.602
But by the way, uh,
they kept me up, all right?

03:09.627 --> 03:11.116
- Really?
- Annie's basically obsessed with me.

03:11.140 --> 03:13.966
She keeps asking me questions
about Ron Howard and Sly Stallone.

03:13.991 --> 03:15.521
I don't believe my daughter
asked you about Ron Howard.

03:15.545 --> 03:16.708
- Listen, um...
- Yeah.

03:17.586 --> 03:18.812
I need to borrow a tie

03:18.837 --> 03:20.461
for Sophie's hospital
gala thing tonight.

03:20.486 --> 03:21.798
- Yeah.
- And make it something sharp, too,

03:21.822 --> 03:23.679
because they're actually
auctioning a date off

03:23.829 --> 03:25.391
with yours truly to raise
money for the charity.

03:25.415 --> 03:26.501
- Told me that.
- I tell you that?

03:26.525 --> 03:28.024
- Told me that, like, four times.
- You jealous?

03:28.048 --> 03:30.683
No black man will ever be
jealous of being auctioned.

03:30.708 --> 03:32.309
Hashtag "AmericanHistory."

03:32.334 --> 03:33.562
Uh, question for you.

03:33.587 --> 03:36.000
Um, what do you think of Deja?

03:37.872 --> 03:40.371
- I think Deja's lovely, adorable.
- Yeah.

03:40.396 --> 03:42.255
You know, in, like, a surly,
nonverbal kind of way.

03:42.279 --> 03:43.747
Well, she's only been here for a month,

03:43.771 --> 03:45.751
so just tread lightly.

03:45.776 --> 03:47.322
- What does that even mean?
- It means...

03:47.346 --> 03:48.563
- It's my middle name, Tread Lightly.
- Just...

03:48.587 --> 03:50.351
Oh, and don't say
anything about her hair.

03:50.376 --> 03:51.405
Alright.

03:55.860 --> 03:56.921
Want two?

03:58.244 --> 04:00.367
Morning. How are you?

04:01.589 --> 04:02.927
What is that?

04:08.450 --> 04:10.870
Beth, you sure you don't want
to go to this gala tonight?

04:10.895 --> 04:11.971
Gonna be fun.

04:11.971 --> 04:14.193
Oh, man, you know I
love me a good Ke-vent.

04:14.218 --> 04:17.053
But, uh, it's a little last
minute to get a babysitter.

04:17.088 --> 04:18.654
Well, first of all, it's a Sophie-vent.

04:18.689 --> 04:20.180
Uh, can I come?

04:22.960 --> 04:24.072
To the gala?

04:26.291 --> 04:29.333
Yeah. Of course. I mean, uh...

04:29.418 --> 04:31.567
I would have to take you.
Kevin will be busy.

04:31.592 --> 04:33.286
Is that, um, is that cool with you, Kev?

04:33.311 --> 04:34.844
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

04:34.992 --> 04:36.881
The more the merrier. It's a great idea.

04:37.184 --> 04:38.700
Cool. Ow.

04:38.778 --> 04:41.588
Um... sorry. Can you
excuse me one second?

04:47.239 --> 04:48.432
What's up?

04:48.502 --> 04:50.080
You really think she's ready to go

04:50.105 --> 04:52.135
to some swanky Manhattan charity ball?

04:52.160 --> 04:53.612
She said she wanted to go.

04:53.854 --> 04:55.182
She actually seemed excited

04:55.207 --> 04:56.659
about wanting to do something, Beth.

04:56.684 --> 04:58.846
- We can't just ignore that.
- What you're ignoring

04:58.871 --> 05:01.039
is the fact that she is
crushing on Kevin.

05:01.064 --> 05:02.799
I'm gonna pretend like
I didn't hear that.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.596
- Hey, hey.
- She's a 12-year-old girl,

05:04.621 --> 05:06.830
and for better or for worse,
not that I think it...

05:06.855 --> 05:08.838
- Just please don't say it.
- But your brother is

05:08.863 --> 05:09.975
- smokin' hot.
- Don't even think it.

05:09.999 --> 05:11.854
Oh, my God. This is disgusting.

05:12.812 --> 05:15.097
I think it might be
too much for her, babe.

05:15.158 --> 05:18.160
It's all those fancy people,
and it's way past her bedtime.

05:18.185 --> 05:19.829
- She doesn't know...
- This is my opportunity

05:19.853 --> 05:21.253
to connect with her.

05:21.469 --> 05:22.742
And I don't care if Kevin...

05:22.767 --> 05:24.359
Lord have mercy on my soul...

05:24.384 --> 05:26.196
is the reason that she wants to go.

05:26.310 --> 05:28.282
Trust me, it'll be fine.

05:28.845 --> 05:30.485
And I get... No, I understand why.

05:30.519 --> 05:32.096
But why doesn't it match
what Howard has?

05:32.120 --> 05:34.321
It should be a fairly easy thing to say.

05:35.066 --> 05:36.208
All right, just make it match.

05:36.233 --> 05:37.266
Just make the work match.

05:37.266 --> 05:38.982
- Hey! How you doing?
- Hi.

05:39.007 --> 05:41.409
- What are you doing here?
- Can I talk to you for a second?

05:41.409 --> 05:43.394
- Yeah.
- In your office?

05:44.462 --> 05:45.571
In my office.

05:51.464 --> 05:52.704
All right, come on.

05:53.091 --> 05:54.345
Oh.

05:55.103 --> 05:56.431
Oh, you thought that I wanted to...?

05:56.644 --> 05:58.424
Uh, yeah.

05:58.522 --> 06:00.683
You said, "Can I talk
to you in your office."

06:00.708 --> 06:02.052
That's how it always starts.

06:02.052 --> 06:04.105
In the pornography that I don't watch.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.308
I'm pregnant.

06:08.579 --> 06:09.723
Excuse me?

06:09.996 --> 06:11.449
I'm eight weeks pregnant.

06:13.571 --> 06:15.066
Um...

06:16.620 --> 06:19.230
S... Uh, so what
you're telling me is...?

06:19.514 --> 06:21.605
We're... pregnant.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.204
Well, that is...

06:27.549 --> 06:31.480
the greatest thing I have
ever heard in my whole life.

06:31.505 --> 06:32.949
Oh, my God.

06:35.539 --> 06:37.753
- Oh, that's wonderful!
- I'm glad you're happy.

06:37.778 --> 06:40.193
Oh, I'm not happy. I'm ecstatic!

06:40.218 --> 06:41.418
I'm-I'm aquiver!

06:41.418 --> 06:43.246
I'm gonna put on my happy
song and I'm gonna be all...

06:43.270 --> 06:44.323
No, no. Don't.

06:45.150 --> 06:46.945
Right? 'Cause...

06:47.315 --> 06:50.621
this might not happen. In fact,
it probably won't happen.

06:50.834 --> 06:52.446
- What?
- I'm 37.

06:52.821 --> 06:55.141
I'm having a geriatric pregnancy.

06:55.166 --> 06:56.500
- Geriatric?
- Geriatric.

06:56.525 --> 06:58.087
It's literally what it's called.

06:58.322 --> 07:00.056
And because of my weight, you know?

07:00.130 --> 07:03.113
And because, well, bad things
just seem to happen to me.

07:03.138 --> 07:04.379
- I don't...
- Okay, I get it.

07:04.691 --> 07:08.127
I do. I do. You don't
want to jinx things.

07:08.152 --> 07:09.613
Not about jinxing.

07:10.566 --> 07:12.160
This is about hope.

07:12.664 --> 07:16.292
It's about hoping that the
little lima bean inside of me...

07:16.864 --> 07:18.166
turns into a grape.

07:18.243 --> 07:20.728
And that the grape turns into a walnut,

07:20.753 --> 07:23.425
and the walnut turns into an apricot.

07:24.471 --> 07:25.900
And the days and the weeks

07:25.925 --> 07:28.203
and months of hoping...

07:28.451 --> 07:30.423
that it doesn't turn disastrous.

07:31.182 --> 07:33.738
And your hoping is only gonna
make my hoping harder.

07:33.793 --> 07:36.161
Okay? So I'm gonna ask you...
No, I'm gonna tell you.

07:36.195 --> 07:37.839
Please keep...

07:38.894 --> 07:40.730
whatever hopes and dreams that you have

07:40.755 --> 07:43.056
about being a dad to yourself.

07:43.236 --> 07:45.946
And never ever tell anyone
about them, including me.

07:46.039 --> 07:47.483
Especially me.

07:48.595 --> 07:50.950
Until the baby's living
outside of my body.

07:57.855 --> 07:58.939
Okay.

08:03.080 --> 08:04.333
<i>Hey, Bug.</i>

08:04.367 --> 08:05.432
Are you ready?

08:09.072 --> 08:12.177
I can't decide between
<i>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</i>

08:12.202 --> 08:13.365
or <i>Turner & Hooch.</i>

08:13.390 --> 08:17.364
Huh. Well, we can't go see
both movies and get a manicure.

08:17.727 --> 08:19.638
Or can we?

08:20.631 --> 08:22.171
Hey, baby, go grab a sweater, okay?

08:22.195 --> 08:23.459
It's cold in the movies.

08:25.892 --> 08:26.771
Pearsons.

08:26.796 --> 08:28.508
<i>May I speak with
Jack Pearson, please?</i>

08:28.532 --> 08:30.852
I'm sorry. He's not here.
Can I take a message?

08:30.909 --> 08:32.025
<i>Tell him that his father,</i>

08:32.025 --> 08:34.174
<i>Stanley Pearson, is close to passing.</i>

08:42.197 --> 08:43.549
<i>You've
reached the Willow Creek</i>

08:43.573 --> 08:45.557
<i>Campground Ranger Station.
Please leave a message.</i>

08:47.252 --> 08:51.936
<i>Hi. Uh, I am leaving
this message for Jack Pearson.</i>

08:52.509 --> 08:54.647
<i>Uh, he and my two sons are staying</i>

08:54.672 --> 08:56.367
<i>at the Willow Creek Campground.</i>

08:56.862 --> 08:59.717
<i>I need him to call me as soon as he can.</i>

08:59.858 --> 09:02.913
<i>The nursing home where
his father Stanley is at</i>

09:03.004 --> 09:06.141
<i>just called and said that he's ill.</i>

09:06.587 --> 09:09.485
<i>Jack, if you're listening,
I need you to call me back.</i>

09:09.510 --> 09:11.274

09:27.612 --> 09:28.838
Jack, enough!

09:33.932 --> 09:37.167
Now, what we're after is rainbow trout.

09:37.635 --> 09:39.256
What we'll probably catch are bass,

09:39.290 --> 09:40.346
but what we don't want...

09:40.371 --> 09:42.705
- Are catfish.
- And carp.

09:43.285 --> 09:44.299
No carp.

09:45.853 --> 09:46.908
You thirsty?

09:47.125 --> 09:48.838
- Nope.
- I am.

09:58.053 --> 10:00.096
- Be right back.
- Okay.

10:10.496 --> 10:11.675
<i>It's my turn to hammer.</i>

10:11.699 --> 10:12.867
<i>Wait, I haven't
hammered it yet.</i>

10:12.891 --> 10:14.519
Hey, guys! Guys!

10:14.870 --> 10:17.671
Less arguing, more tent-building.

10:18.011 --> 10:19.620
- Okay.
- Grab that string.

10:21.046 --> 10:23.481
Oh, I get it.
This goes up like this.

10:23.506 --> 10:25.252
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about right there.

10:25.276 --> 10:27.902
- Teamwork, huh?
- It's up! This is awesome!

10:28.246 --> 10:29.332
We have so much...

10:30.747 --> 10:31.747
Ugh, Dad!

10:31.772 --> 10:33.106
Can you help me, please?!

10:33.131 --> 10:35.799
Help, help! The sky is falling!

10:36.281 --> 10:37.972
- Okay.
- Ah, it's funny.

10:37.997 --> 10:39.832
- Come on out.
- Did you have fun in there?

10:40.439 --> 10:41.606
Get over here.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.707
Over here. Right now.

10:45.496 --> 10:46.590
Do you think that's funny?

10:46.855 --> 10:48.847
If I said yes, would you be mad?

10:49.027 --> 10:50.683
He's your brother, Kevin.

10:51.730 --> 10:53.340
You should be able
to depend on each other

10:53.364 --> 10:55.644
more than anyone else, more than
anyone else in the world.

10:56.028 --> 10:57.183
Look at me.

10:58.746 --> 11:00.480
You will be good to your brother.

11:00.685 --> 11:02.035
Now rebuild that tent.

11:03.527 --> 11:05.145
When you're done,
you're gonna sit inside it.

11:05.169 --> 11:07.636
- For how long?
- Until I tell you you can come out.

11:19.472 --> 11:21.965
Hey, uh... this is
Kevin Pearson calling,

11:21.990 --> 11:23.894
uh, leaving a message for Dr. Lu.

11:24.028 --> 11:26.597
I realize it's the weekend.
Sorry about that.

11:26.622 --> 11:29.238
Um, but I am in New York right now,

11:29.263 --> 11:33.027
and I ran out of my prescription
for, uh, for my Vicodin again.

11:33.052 --> 11:34.769
It's no big deal. Uh, I realize

11:34.794 --> 11:37.395
we've gone through
all of the, uh, the refills.

11:38.691 --> 11:40.816
So, you know, uh, hit me back
when you get a chance.

11:40.957 --> 11:42.386
Thank you very much.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.488
Who you talking to?

11:45.513 --> 11:48.910
Uh, it was Kate. She had a...
universal remote problem.

11:48.935 --> 11:51.363
Okay, so this is option number two.

11:52.972 --> 11:54.043
Well, hello.

11:54.068 --> 11:56.269
Hello. I love option number two.

11:56.294 --> 11:59.104
You don't think it's too... flowery?

11:59.129 --> 12:01.427
Too flowery? Is that...
Can you possibly be too flowery?

12:01.452 --> 12:03.418
No, it's great. I love it. Huge fan.

12:05.441 --> 12:06.488
Really?

12:06.604 --> 12:08.436
Starting a little early.

12:08.461 --> 12:09.553
It's just beer.

12:09.578 --> 12:11.100
It's the weekend. We wrapped a movie,

12:11.125 --> 12:13.249
and I'm-I'm, uh, I'm celebrating that.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.148
- I'm relaxing a little bit.
- Okay, well, just,

12:15.172 --> 12:16.616
you know, try to pace yourself

12:16.641 --> 12:18.743
'cause we have a long
night of schmoozing.

12:19.124 --> 12:20.194
Tell me about it.

12:20.536 --> 12:22.936
I'm sorry, Soph.
I'm just, you know, tired.

12:23.311 --> 12:24.803
- Little tired.
- Yeah.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.348
I'm happy to be here with you, though.

12:26.440 --> 12:28.085
- Yeah. Me, too.
- Yeah.

12:34.395 --> 12:36.811
Wasn't there, like, a-a third option

12:36.836 --> 12:38.069
you were gonna show me?

12:38.282 --> 12:40.632
I think it's too booby.

12:40.657 --> 12:41.663
It's too booby?

12:41.852 --> 12:43.655
Let's go with that one.

12:43.995 --> 12:45.729
Does she like the dress you got her?

12:45.866 --> 12:47.649
- She looks fantastic.
- Hey, don't say anything

12:47.673 --> 12:48.796
about the way she looks.

12:48.821 --> 12:49.952
I wasn't gonna tell her...

12:49.977 --> 12:51.177
And no jokes, okay?

12:51.202 --> 12:52.536
You're a terrible joke teller.

12:52.561 --> 12:54.538
That's hurtful and untrue.

12:54.680 --> 12:56.569
- I'm very funny.
- Man, just be cool.

12:57.014 --> 12:58.483
I'm Randall "Cool" Pearson.

12:58.512 --> 12:59.577
Oh, no.

12:59.602 --> 13:01.202
That's my middle name. Yeah.

13:02.810 --> 13:03.913
You ready?

13:04.606 --> 13:05.624
Okay.

13:06.756 --> 13:08.085
Have a nice time.

13:09.749 --> 13:10.751
See you later.

13:10.751 --> 13:12.016
- Hey.
- Huh?

13:12.416 --> 13:13.694
Cool means normal.

13:13.719 --> 13:14.885
- All right?
- No, it doesn't.

13:14.965 --> 13:16.804
Cool means cool.

13:25.523 --> 13:27.035
You see that Michaels over there?

13:28.539 --> 13:29.686
Used to be a Kohl's.

13:31.128 --> 13:32.179
Right.

13:34.642 --> 13:36.804
Ah, and that Dunkin' Donuts
by the light.

13:36.829 --> 13:38.585
That used to be a Dairy Queen.

13:38.939 --> 13:40.663
Man, I used to love me a Blizzard.

13:41.196 --> 13:42.343
You down with DQ?

13:45.515 --> 13:47.483
The DQ Blizzard.

13:57.161 --> 13:58.996
Hi, uh, I spoke to someone on the phone.

13:59.021 --> 14:00.874
I'm here for Stanley Pearson.

14:00.899 --> 14:03.313
I'm his daughter-in-law,
Rebecca Pearson.

14:26.578 --> 14:27.647
Hi.

14:32.190 --> 14:33.694
I'm Rebecca.

14:36.189 --> 14:37.288
Jack's wife.

14:54.524 --> 14:55.524
Um...

14:57.141 --> 14:58.894
the nursing home called me.

14:58.919 --> 15:02.791
And Jack wasn't home, so, um, here I am.

15:06.084 --> 15:08.455
Is there anything that I can do for you?

15:14.304 --> 15:15.868
Okay, well, um...

15:20.181 --> 15:22.578
It was nice to have finally met you.

15:24.054 --> 15:26.328
I'm sorry that it's under
these circumstances.

15:28.966 --> 15:30.600
I know you and Jack

15:31.070 --> 15:34.030
had a pretty difficult relationship.

15:34.107 --> 15:36.035
Um, that's a vast understatement.

15:41.529 --> 15:44.020
You sure there's nothing that I can do?

15:51.239 --> 15:53.863
Is that my granddaughter?

15:55.908 --> 15:56.931
Excuse me.

15:57.446 --> 15:59.046
- Is that my grandpa?
- Kate.

16:09.584 --> 16:10.746
He's coming back.

16:12.614 --> 16:13.762
He's coming back.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.105
He's coming back.

16:36.122 --> 16:38.804
I said no Game Boy. Turn it off, now.

16:41.175 --> 16:44.292
- Why are you so hard on him?
- I'm not.

16:44.317 --> 16:47.592
Yes, you are, Kev,
and I want you to tell me why.

16:47.802 --> 16:50.832
- He's annoying.
- No, he's not annoying.

16:53.007 --> 16:55.449
He... He's just trying to show
you how much he loves you.

16:56.495 --> 16:57.504
You know, it...

16:58.677 --> 17:02.826
it would be so easy
for you to be nice to him.

17:03.479 --> 17:06.654
But it takes you more energy
and causes more trouble,

17:06.679 --> 17:08.069
you being mean to him like you are.

17:08.093 --> 17:10.076
So why... why can't you
just be nice to him?

17:10.101 --> 17:11.098
I don't know.

17:11.124 --> 17:12.366
That's not a good enough answer, Kevin.

17:12.390 --> 17:13.451
I want you to tell me why.

17:13.476 --> 17:14.926
- I don't know!
- Is it because

17:15.070 --> 17:17.454
he gets special attention sometimes?

17:17.479 --> 17:19.604
You know, 'cause all you kids,
you need something different.

17:19.627 --> 17:21.368
At different moments,
you need something different

17:21.393 --> 17:22.893
- all the t...
- I don't know! Stop!

17:23.208 --> 17:24.923
You said I had to sit in here.

17:25.185 --> 17:27.557
You didn't say we had to talk about it.

17:27.936 --> 17:29.769
I don't want to talk about it.

17:34.263 --> 17:35.321
Okay.

17:36.797 --> 17:38.165
We'll talk about it later.

17:54.636 --> 17:57.272
When I walked to the classroom
of my new school

17:57.297 --> 17:59.676
and saw all those new faces, I thought,

18:00.023 --> 18:03.676
"Whoa. None of these
kids looks like me."

18:04.800 --> 18:07.130
I felt like I am in the wrong place

18:07.155 --> 18:08.722
at the wrong time.

18:08.816 --> 18:10.411
Beam me up, Scotty.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.403
That's a <i>Star Trek</i> reference.

18:15.602 --> 18:16.708
You know <i>Star Trek?</i>

18:16.991 --> 18:19.380
"These are the voyages
of the starship <i>Enterprise."</i>

18:19.405 --> 18:20.575
Oh, there's your brother.

18:24.795 --> 18:26.579
<i>I'm starting to get
really uncomfortable here,</i>

18:26.604 --> 18:29.541
and, uh... you know,
if I could get that refill,

18:29.566 --> 18:31.221
that would be... that would be great.

18:31.246 --> 18:33.510
Um, it's no big deal,
but call me back, please.

18:33.535 --> 18:34.535
All right.

18:36.152 --> 18:37.229
Hey! Look at you.

18:37.254 --> 18:39.190
- You clean up nice, don't you?
- Hey.

18:39.300 --> 18:40.824
- Good to see you.
- Don't talk about her hair.

18:40.848 --> 18:41.848
- Really?
- Yeah.

18:41.910 --> 18:43.354
- All right. Uh, oh.
- Hey.

18:43.379 --> 18:45.354
- This is, uh, this is Sophie.
- Good to see you.

18:45.379 --> 18:46.885
Sophie's my girlfriend.

18:46.910 --> 18:47.924
Hi!

18:48.107 --> 18:49.112
I love your dress.

18:49.137 --> 18:51.712
I like your hair, by the way.
It's very, very...

18:51.737 --> 18:53.872
sort of Halle Berry in <i>Swordfish.</i>

18:54.216 --> 18:55.244
Thanks.

18:55.626 --> 18:57.689
Um, I like <i>The Manny.</i>

18:58.291 --> 18:59.283
You do?

18:59.308 --> 19:00.337
Do you watch <i>The Manny?</i>

19:00.449 --> 19:01.681
What's your favorite episode?

19:02.101 --> 19:03.173
Which one's your favorite?

19:03.440 --> 19:04.486
"Iron Manny"?

19:04.615 --> 19:06.267
"The Thin Manny"? "Manny Get Your Gun"?

19:06.292 --> 19:08.107
- I'm gonna grab a drink.
- "Of Mice and Mannys"?

19:08.131 --> 19:09.103
"Manny-Pedi"?

19:09.128 --> 19:10.946
I thought you were a fan.

19:17.005 --> 19:18.124
Hey, kiddo.

19:18.515 --> 19:20.249
I'm sorry this is so boring.

19:20.456 --> 19:22.210
I just want to wait a little bit longer

19:22.235 --> 19:23.475
and see if your dad calls back.

19:24.037 --> 19:26.650
You think Dad's gonna look
like that when he's old?

19:27.772 --> 19:28.811
Better not.

19:28.924 --> 19:30.704
I don't want to get old like that.

19:30.774 --> 19:32.651
I don't want my hair to fall out.

19:32.728 --> 19:35.476
You do have really,
really beautiful hair.

19:35.501 --> 19:36.882
You know that?

19:37.062 --> 19:39.382
You want to guess how much hair
you had when you were born?

19:40.411 --> 19:42.023
Like, almost none.

19:42.367 --> 19:44.164
- Ew!
- Not ew.

19:45.445 --> 19:46.796
What about Kevin and Randall?

19:46.906 --> 19:48.078
Eggheads.

19:48.149 --> 19:51.047
All three of you
were just big old eggheads.

19:51.155 --> 19:53.423
Totally bald.

19:54.103 --> 19:55.634
But that's how it works.

19:55.736 --> 19:58.337
<i>Everything changes all the time.</i>

19:59.236 --> 20:02.292
<i>And when you're a mom,
you get a front row seat</i>

20:02.317 --> 20:03.812
<i>to the best show in town:</i>

20:04.145 --> 20:05.820
Watching your kids grow up.

20:07.789 --> 20:08.984
Give me that egghead.

20:09.743 --> 20:11.593
It's underneath
all this hair somewhere, right?

20:12.990 --> 20:14.937
I'm at
this cocktail party, right?

20:15.237 --> 20:16.704
And they're serving

20:16.729 --> 20:19.882
these mini pizzas
with Gorgonzola and pear,

20:19.907 --> 20:24.676
which is just my favorite thing
in the whole world, you know?

20:25.419 --> 20:27.470
And I just panic. Bolt.

20:27.664 --> 20:29.983
And I-I'm standing out by the valet,

20:30.008 --> 20:32.169
and this guy is smoking a cigarette,

20:32.169 --> 20:34.363
and I-I just, like, ask him for one.

20:34.824 --> 20:38.466
And he turns out to be
really nice and super cute.

20:38.491 --> 20:40.659
His name is Terrence,

20:40.708 --> 20:43.773
and we've kind of
been seeing each other.

20:43.798 --> 20:46.930
But that's not the point.
The point is...

20:48.574 --> 20:49.735
I've started smoking.

20:50.984 --> 20:53.073
Vaping, actually.

20:55.731 --> 20:56.938
You're vaping?

20:57.755 --> 20:59.088
That was the point?

20:59.233 --> 21:00.711
It's, like, a gateway thing.

21:00.893 --> 21:02.775
Oh. Okay.

21:02.800 --> 21:04.992
SO, TO REVIEW:

21:05.080 --> 21:08.583
You exit a cocktail party

21:08.608 --> 21:11.076
serving delicious mini pizzas,
you smoke one cigarette,

21:11.119 --> 21:12.787
you meet a guy... a nice guy

21:12.812 --> 21:15.113
whose name is Terrence...
And now you're dating.

21:15.138 --> 21:16.867
And now you're whining about vaping?

21:16.892 --> 21:19.343
- Vaping?!
- Seriously?

21:19.418 --> 21:21.752
You're snapping at me? Again?

21:21.777 --> 21:23.377
I am. Again.

21:23.718 --> 21:25.029
Do you know why no one's defending you?

21:25.053 --> 21:27.082
Because you don't have a problem!

21:27.874 --> 21:30.182
The people that come here have problems.

21:30.249 --> 21:32.355
Real problems with real issues.

21:32.592 --> 21:33.952
What do you come here for, anyway?

21:34.243 --> 21:35.516
So you can feel better about yourself

21:35.540 --> 21:37.428
'cause you're not
as screwed up as we are?

21:38.766 --> 21:40.366
Screw you, Madison.

21:46.618 --> 21:48.886
Would anyone else like to share?

21:51.593 --> 21:53.036
Screw you, Kate!

21:54.856 --> 21:56.565
Screw you and your terrible attitude,

21:56.590 --> 21:58.281
and that is not an easy
thing for me to say

21:58.306 --> 22:00.031
because confrontation makes me cry!

22:00.940 --> 22:02.328
Why do you hate me?

22:02.353 --> 22:04.988
Because you're annoying
and you shouldn't be here.

22:05.013 --> 22:06.414
Well, I think <i>you're</i> annoying.

22:06.588 --> 22:09.562
The way that you and your fiancé
come here every week

22:09.587 --> 22:11.588
and smile and giggle at each other

22:11.613 --> 22:13.898
when some of us don't have
anyone to do that with.

22:14.296 --> 22:15.786
You have the guy that you vape with.

22:15.811 --> 22:18.013
His name is Terrence!

22:18.758 --> 22:20.818
And he probably won't last,
because, you know what,

22:21.078 --> 22:22.749
nobody I date ever does.

22:23.116 --> 22:25.444
Do you think it's because
you're <i>annoying?</i>

22:25.477 --> 22:27.492
Oh, my God! You suck!

22:41.256 --> 22:42.466
Oh, my God.

22:47.156 --> 22:48.551
Are you insane?!

22:49.491 --> 22:52.356
Oh, my God, are you actually hurt?

22:52.381 --> 22:54.567
I don't... I don't...
I don't know. I-I...

22:54.854 --> 22:56.142
I don't think so.

22:56.277 --> 22:57.727
Kate, it was just a little tap.

22:57.752 --> 22:59.392
- Are you serious?
- No, but I'm pregnant.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.607
I just freaked out for a second.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.266
But, um... but I'm...

23:05.291 --> 23:06.825
uh, I'm fine.

23:08.056 --> 23:09.131
Kate.

23:09.891 --> 23:11.924
Oh, my God, you're pregnant?

23:11.949 --> 23:14.731
Yeah. I know, I know. It's hard, um...

23:14.756 --> 23:16.400
- it's hard to believe, but...
- Kate.

23:16.549 --> 23:18.850
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Oh.

23:18.875 --> 23:21.487
That's amazing! I'm so happy for you!

23:21.512 --> 23:23.420
- Thanks.
- Oh, my God.

23:23.875 --> 23:26.005
Yeah, but don't tell anyone,
because it's still real...

23:26.030 --> 23:28.041
really early stages, okay?

23:39.437 --> 23:43.651
You may know him as
television's very own Manny,

23:44.224 --> 23:46.921
But the next item on our auction agenda

23:47.294 --> 23:48.645
is a whole lot more than that.

23:49.204 --> 23:52.654
He's starring in Ron Howard's
new World War II epic,

23:52.679 --> 23:55.470
<i>Hill 400, that just finished shooting.</i>

24:03.088 --> 24:04.559
Oh, no, you d...

24:05.547 --> 24:07.452
Sorry, you don't...
you don't eat that part.

24:07.747 --> 24:09.188
You don't eat that part.

24:09.802 --> 24:12.012
I'm sorry. I just didn't want
you to choke... that's all.

24:12.037 --> 24:13.110
You okay?

24:17.444 --> 24:19.270
I have to go to the bathroom.

24:26.548 --> 24:29.587
So, without further ado,

24:29.612 --> 24:32.694
may I introduce to you the one,

24:32.719 --> 24:35.236
the only, Kevin Pearson.

24:36.315 --> 24:38.702
Uh, thank you for hitting me
back on a weekend.

24:38.727 --> 24:39.861
I really appreciate it.

24:40.422 --> 24:43.266
Listen, I was just... I was hoping
we could get one more, uh...

24:43.584 --> 24:45.648
one more refill on the prescription.

24:47.660 --> 24:50.754
Kevin Pearson, ladies and gentlemen.

24:51.211 --> 24:53.444
Right. No, I-I understand
you've already refilled

24:53.469 --> 24:55.077
the prescription one more time
than you should have,

24:55.101 --> 24:56.941
but I-I don't know why
it's that big of a deal.

25:01.476 --> 25:02.821
Kevin Pearson!

25:02.846 --> 25:04.326
Well, I don't have a doctor out here.

25:07.408 --> 25:09.107
All right, look, you know what,
here's the thing though.

25:09.131 --> 25:10.818
If you can't help a guy
when he's in pain, right...

25:10.842 --> 25:12.756
Which I obviously am...
Then you're kind of useless.

25:12.780 --> 25:14.225
And-and, I'm sorry, I find it ridiculous

25:14.249 --> 25:15.560
that you're treating me this way.

25:15.584 --> 25:17.819
You know what, take my
headshot off the wall, okay?

25:17.844 --> 25:20.279
It's-it's a doctor's
office, not a diner.

25:20.806 --> 25:23.472
Hello? Hello?

25:24.183 --> 25:26.279
Excuse me. Excuse me.

25:45.898 --> 25:47.037
Here you go, bud.

25:51.948 --> 25:53.106
Kevin's fine.

25:53.573 --> 25:54.723
I bet he's hungry.

25:55.367 --> 25:58.981
I know that you love
your brother, Randall,

26:00.044 --> 26:02.075
and you want him to
love you, and he does.

26:02.120 --> 26:04.057
- Yeah, right.
- He does.

26:04.296 --> 26:05.444
I promise you.

26:08.540 --> 26:10.251
But, look, sometimes...

26:11.242 --> 26:12.466
sometimes you got to...

26:13.134 --> 26:16.772
give people some space,
let them come to you.

26:19.451 --> 26:20.671
Just got to be patient.

26:21.052 --> 26:22.803
But I don't like patience.

26:22.922 --> 26:24.381
Nobody likes patience.

26:32.608 --> 26:33.751
Hey, Kev.

26:34.702 --> 26:35.704
Randall.

26:38.866 --> 26:40.047
What are we doing?

26:40.759 --> 26:42.196
Deja's in there.

26:43.512 --> 26:44.794
Is she okay? Is she...

26:44.819 --> 26:47.320
- is she sick?
- Of me, I think.

26:47.902 --> 26:48.919
But she likes you.

26:48.944 --> 26:51.321
No. No, no, no.
She likes that I was the Manny.

26:51.346 --> 26:54.748
No. Kev, bro, she likes you.

26:55.252 --> 26:57.611
You're good with her.
You're good with people.

26:58.522 --> 26:59.946
I come on too strong.

27:01.393 --> 27:03.260
That's why I'm standing
out here, trying to...

27:03.323 --> 27:05.458
stop myself from barging
into the women's room

27:05.483 --> 27:06.917
to make her talk to me.

27:09.090 --> 27:10.149
Madam.

27:10.322 --> 27:11.329
How are we?

27:12.529 --> 27:14.962
I should not go in there.

27:14.987 --> 27:16.954
No. No, you should not go in there.

27:16.979 --> 27:18.259
- But I'm going to.
- I know.

27:18.284 --> 27:19.384
I'm definitely going to.

27:19.409 --> 27:20.676
- Yep.
- Yeah.

27:21.604 --> 27:23.310
You know why?

27:23.335 --> 27:25.021
- Hmm?
- 'Cause you care too much.

27:25.269 --> 27:26.269
Yeah.

27:27.310 --> 27:28.482
You always have.

27:29.065 --> 27:30.099
You just...

27:31.545 --> 27:33.972
- You feel too much.
- Yeah.

27:34.458 --> 27:36.359
- And I... I mean, I...
- Hmm.

27:36.463 --> 27:38.591
- I try not to feel anything at all.
- No, that's not true.

27:38.615 --> 27:40.863
It is true. It's true, Randall.

27:42.548 --> 27:43.722
Hey, you okay?

27:46.885 --> 27:48.972
Yeah. Yeah.

27:50.029 --> 27:51.029
Okay.

27:52.427 --> 27:53.582
I'm going in.

27:53.721 --> 27:55.746
- Hey, Randall. You know, there...
- Hmm?

27:57.203 --> 27:59.980
There could be a woman...
pooping in there.

28:02.052 --> 28:03.054
I know.

28:07.375 --> 28:08.871
Man coming in.

28:16.674 --> 28:17.744
Jack Pearson?

28:19.164 --> 28:20.260
Yeah, I'm Jack.

28:24.355 --> 28:26.115
Got your wife on the radio.

28:26.115 --> 28:28.395
She's patched through to the phone.

28:29.193 --> 28:30.372
Did she say what's wrong?

28:30.397 --> 28:33.150
No, she's been trying to reach
you all day. Just push to talk.

28:36.351 --> 28:38.245
Bec? <i>Bec, what's wrong?</i>

28:38.245 --> 28:40.096
Yeah, every-everybody's fine.
Everything's okay.

28:40.121 --> 28:42.036
Um, I just, uh...

28:43.145 --> 28:46.880
The nursing home where
your dad is at called.

28:48.518 --> 28:49.534
My dad?

28:49.953 --> 28:52.896
And I couldn't get ahold
of you, so I came.

28:53.898 --> 28:55.508
<i>You're not mad at me, are you?</i>

28:55.508 --> 28:59.084
Wait, y-you're at
my father's nursing home?

28:59.150 --> 29:00.580
Wh-What's wrong with him?

29:01.112 --> 29:02.957
He's old.

29:03.669 --> 29:06.486
I think it's, uh, cirrhosis.

29:06.939 --> 29:08.051
But he's...

29:09.947 --> 29:11.129
dying, Jack.

29:11.154 --> 29:14.554
<i>I mean, I don't think that
he really has much time left.</i>

29:17.980 --> 29:21.053
Do you... want to come back?

29:31.138 --> 29:33.536
No, uh, I'm gonna stay
here with the boys.

29:33.928 --> 29:35.019
<i>Are you sure?</i>

29:37.592 --> 29:38.749
Yeah, I'm sure.

29:40.265 --> 29:43.648
I mean, is there anything
that you want me to... tell him?

29:50.854 --> 29:51.962
No.

29:53.646 --> 29:56.217
No, that man's been dead
to me for a long time.

30:01.695 --> 30:03.632
How are... how are the boys doing?

30:05.844 --> 30:09.101
Well, baby steps, but...
we'll get there.

30:10.903 --> 30:12.408
You are a miracle.

30:12.925 --> 30:14.127
You know that, Jack?

30:14.868 --> 30:17.939
Coming from your dad
and being the dad that you are,

30:17.964 --> 30:19.940
you are a freaking miracle.

30:23.261 --> 30:25.498
Yeah, well, takes one to know one, Bec.

30:28.582 --> 30:29.638
I love you.

30:30.391 --> 30:31.515
I love you, too.

30:32.975 --> 30:33.975
Bye.

30:57.502 --> 30:58.533
Hey, babe?

30:58.620 --> 30:59.642
Yeah?

31:01.359 --> 31:03.924
Uh, so, I got good and bad news.

31:03.949 --> 31:06.495
Uh-oh. Always bad news first.

31:07.522 --> 31:09.275
I banged up the car.

31:09.463 --> 31:10.658
What? Are you all right?

31:10.844 --> 31:13.654
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
It was just a fender bender.

31:14.556 --> 31:15.556
Okay.

31:16.404 --> 31:17.814
And the good news?

31:18.015 --> 31:20.361
The person I got in the
accident with was Madison.

31:20.522 --> 31:22.490
- Did you kill her?
- No.

31:22.524 --> 31:24.306
Oh. I thought you said it was good news.

31:24.331 --> 31:25.978
But I did tell her
that we were pregnant.

31:26.744 --> 31:27.885
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

31:27.955 --> 31:28.931
And?

31:28.956 --> 31:30.799
And it actually felt
good saying it out loud.

31:30.996 --> 31:31.986
Really?

31:32.011 --> 31:34.646
- And I want you to come with me.
- Okay, where are we going?

31:34.709 --> 31:36.011
- Just come with me.
- Okay, where we going?

31:36.035 --> 31:37.706
- Don't ask questions.
- I'm right behind you.

31:37.730 --> 31:38.948
- I'm not gonna ask any questions.
- Okay.

31:38.972 --> 31:39.972
Where are we going?

31:45.850 --> 31:47.400
Ah, sorry about that. Mwah.

31:47.425 --> 31:50.017
How are you? So, what, uh...

31:50.705 --> 31:51.744
what'd I miss?

31:53.002 --> 31:54.017
Huh?

31:54.098 --> 31:55.841
You see that nice lady over there?

31:57.994 --> 31:59.999
Uh-huh.
- She bought you.

32:00.757 --> 32:01.863
14 grand.

32:06.199 --> 32:08.340
Oh. Like, I missed it?

32:08.599 --> 32:09.599
That you did.

32:12.426 --> 32:14.699
- Oh, wow.
- Where the hell were you, Kevin?

32:14.825 --> 32:16.293
Uh, I was in the...

32:16.502 --> 32:18.840
Ron called, you know?

32:18.865 --> 32:21.011
Something about dailies and
we need to reshoot a few things,

32:21.035 --> 32:23.301
I guess, or he thinks maybe
we do, maybe we don't...

32:23.326 --> 32:24.566
You embarrassed me.

32:25.608 --> 32:27.824
You embarrassed me
in front of my friends

32:28.765 --> 32:30.246
and coworkers.

32:34.433 --> 32:35.738
You're not gonna say anything?

32:35.763 --> 32:38.083
I don't know what you want me
to say though, you know? I...

32:38.902 --> 32:39.902
I'm sorry.

32:39.927 --> 32:41.840
Why? Why did you choose to get drunk?

32:41.865 --> 32:43.707
- Tonight. My night.
- Okay, calm down.

32:43.732 --> 32:45.366
This wasn't like somebody, you know...

32:45.391 --> 32:47.028
Like, it wasn't a choice.
I didn't plan it.

32:47.052 --> 32:48.810
Really? Somebody just
put a gun to your head

32:48.835 --> 32:50.107
and told you to drink a dozen bourbons?

32:50.131 --> 32:52.433
Okay. All right. Look, here we go.
Pile on, Sophie. The...

32:52.458 --> 32:53.888
- Jump in, the water's warm.
- Oh, no.

32:53.912 --> 32:56.293
Don't you do that. Don't you
make me the nagging girlfriend

32:56.318 --> 32:58.926
- when you were a jerk. That...
- Okay. All right. No, no. Okay.

33:02.271 --> 33:03.293
I'm sorry.

33:04.254 --> 33:05.855
I'm sorry, okay?

33:07.707 --> 33:10.269
You're right. I'm-I'm just...
I'm, you know...

33:10.514 --> 33:11.590
You're what?

33:14.523 --> 33:15.933
You're what, Kevin?

33:17.831 --> 33:20.633
You've been weird ever since
you got back to New York.

33:20.658 --> 33:21.980
- Have I? Okay.
- Yeah.

33:22.005 --> 33:25.097
You know, I-I never should have agreed

33:25.122 --> 33:26.847
to come here tonight, okay?

33:26.872 --> 33:29.394
I didn't want to let you down,
that's the truth, but I am...

33:31.943 --> 33:33.832
I'm exhausted, you know?

33:37.283 --> 33:39.558
Now, look, I-I'm gonna...
I-I got to get...

33:40.638 --> 33:43.379
I probably just need some air,
so I'm gonna go, you know...

33:45.149 --> 33:46.996
I'll meet you back at your place, okay?

34:09.342 --> 34:11.621
You gonna stand out there forever?

34:13.650 --> 34:14.650
Yep.

34:17.395 --> 34:19.318
You can't grab me like that.

34:26.458 --> 34:29.052
The second-to-last home was the worst.

34:30.429 --> 34:33.091
I was always in trouble there.
We all were.

34:38.143 --> 34:40.474
It was because of the magazines.

34:42.902 --> 34:45.333
Foster mom, Alice,

34:46.263 --> 34:50.232
she had these subscriptions
to all the beauty magazines...

34:51.292 --> 34:53.989
<i>Glamour, Vogue, Cosmo.</i>

34:56.264 --> 34:59.021
I think her boyfriend knew
that we thought it was funny,

34:59.984 --> 35:01.652
'cause she was ugly.

35:04.717 --> 35:06.560
She was butt-ugly.

35:09.474 --> 35:11.669
That's why he used them on us.

35:12.591 --> 35:13.841
The magazines.

35:17.018 --> 35:19.107
Because they didn't bruise much.

35:21.790 --> 35:24.138
That's why I don't like being grabbed.

35:58.260 --> 35:59.268
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:59.299 --> 36:02.319
So you can tell anyone in here.

36:02.635 --> 36:03.870
And then we'll never come here again.

36:03.894 --> 36:05.057
- Anyone in here?
- Yeah.

36:05.082 --> 36:06.525
Okay, do I have to speak in code?

36:06.550 --> 36:07.690
Uh, 'cause I don't think
they're gonna get it.

36:07.714 --> 36:10.563
No. Go crazy. Use the "P" word.

36:10.952 --> 36:13.016
- Bold move. I like it.
- Mm.

36:13.525 --> 36:15.189
Um, I think that's my dude.

36:15.214 --> 36:16.924
Just-just wait right here, okay?

36:16.949 --> 36:18.275
- Okay.
- All right.

36:18.986 --> 36:20.946
Uh, excuse me, my good man.

36:21.076 --> 36:26.350
Do you think that you could play
just one song for me

36:26.375 --> 36:27.843
- on your house system?
- Uh...

36:27.843 --> 36:29.521
Just, uh, hear me out. Um...

36:29.546 --> 36:30.923
You see that beautiful woman over there?

36:30.923 --> 36:34.243
She is pregnant with my child.

36:34.595 --> 36:36.126
Well, congrats, man. That's awesome.

36:36.151 --> 36:38.377
Thanks. So, what do you say?

36:40.758 --> 36:42.134
- One song. Great.
- Just this once.

36:42.134 --> 36:43.974
Okay, it's my happy song,
and it's all cued up.

36:44.232 --> 36:46.265
Uh, he's just gonna
charge it a little for me.

36:46.290 --> 36:47.828
Those batteries, they go...

36:47.907 --> 36:50.131
So he's just gonna charge it.

36:51.921 --> 36:53.478
- Toby?
- What?

36:54.041 --> 36:55.222
- Tobias?
- I'm sorry.

36:55.247 --> 36:57.749
I'm sorry, I... had to.

37:03.383 --> 37:04.706
How's it going? We're pregnant.

37:04.731 --> 37:05.945
Hi there. We're having a baby.

37:24.546 --> 37:26.289
All right, we can go now.

38:19.114 --> 38:20.743
Are these cold yet?

38:27.817 --> 38:29.486
You guys have one of those for me?

38:30.333 --> 38:31.394
Here.

38:31.787 --> 38:33.499
Hand me that bag.

38:39.165 --> 38:40.611
You better spin that one.

38:41.734 --> 38:43.010
Ooh! Ooh!

38:53.532 --> 38:54.914
Jack's not coming.

39:18.906 --> 39:20.221
Just so you know,

39:21.006 --> 39:23.995
your son is a great father

39:24.020 --> 39:26.814
<i>and provider and husband.</i>

39:28.019 --> 39:30.025
<i>You think you screwed
him up, but you didn't.</i>

39:30.545 --> 39:32.556
<i>You only made him stronger.</i>

39:54.204 --> 39:55.273
- Hi!
- Hi!

39:55.298 --> 39:56.671
I missed you.

39:58.105 --> 39:59.210
Hey, bud.

39:59.349 --> 40:00.782
- It was so awesome.
- Yeah?

40:00.949 --> 40:02.665
Gonna get you!

40:32.835 --> 40:36.006
Hi, um, this is Kevin Pearson,
the actor.

40:36.031 --> 40:38.834
Listen, I was, um, a patient
of Dr. Miller's

40:38.867 --> 40:40.345
a couple years ago.

40:42.097 --> 40:43.598
I'm in a lot of pain,

40:43.631 --> 40:47.723
so, uh, call me back, please.

41:00.903 --> 41:02.204
Where are we?

41:07.550 --> 41:09.902
Look who finally woke up.

41:11.253 --> 41:12.299
Where's Dad?

41:12.605 --> 41:13.928
In there.

41:14.340 --> 41:16.237
When's he coming back?

41:16.826 --> 41:18.828
Probably not for a while.

41:18.861 --> 41:21.663
But don't worry, Nicky,
I'm not going anywhere.

41:23.132 --> 41:25.100
I'm not going anywhere.
