WEBVTT

00:25.834 --> 00:27.291
(female #1)
'It's fun, right?'

00:27.375 --> 00:30.458
It's better than watching
frat guys play beer pong.

00:30.542 --> 00:32.625
You get credit for
working on the campaign?

00:32.709 --> 00:34.417
Oh, yeah,
but I'd do it anyway.

00:35.959 --> 00:39.083
'Doesn't it bother you
that he's such a womanizer?'

00:39.166 --> 00:41.875
He's not gonna do that
in the White House.

00:50.166 --> 00:51.792
Who's the face?

00:51.875 --> 00:52.917
That's David Lake.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.583
He runs our
campaign office.

00:56.041 --> 00:57.208
(female #2)
'That his girlfriend?'

00:57.291 --> 00:58.500
Sister.

01:05.792 --> 01:07.208
'Vanessa..'

01:07.291 --> 01:10.959
...that drunk they threw out,
was he with you?

01:11.041 --> 01:12.875
with
- 'Cause that was embarrassing.

01:12.959 --> 01:14.291
I know.
I'm
sorry.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.083
It wasn't her fault, Abbey.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
David, we never got to talk.

01:19.917 --> 01:22.291
Uh...later.
I promise.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.542
Now, him.
I'd vote for.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.792
They say he's the future
of the party.

01:32.083 --> 01:34.458
It's loud in here.
You want to walk
outside?

02:24.917 --> 02:26.458
Hey.

02:26.542 --> 02:27.625
What took you so long?

02:27.709 --> 02:29.875
[sighs]
Had to doll up.

02:29.959 --> 02:31.041
Vera got lucky.

02:32.041 --> 02:33.875
I'm on the up
desk, all
night.

02:33.959 --> 02:36.542
Eight minutes to go on the
shift
and this guy's gotta buy it.

02:36.625 --> 02:39.250
Darren Kleeman.
Two in the head, up close.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.542
Any witnesses?

02:40.625 --> 02:42.625
They heard it, but
they didn't see it.

02:47.834 --> 02:51.542
Working cold jobs, you almost
forget how much blood there
is.

02:51.625 --> 02:53.917
That does seem
extra-gory.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.500
I'm assuming there's a good
reason we got dragged out here?

02:56.583 --> 02:58.291
Mm. Inside.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.417
Guy didn't believe
in housework.

03:07.667 --> 03:09.625
Looks like some kind of shrine.

03:11.417 --> 03:13.375
Or trophy case.

03:13.458 --> 03:16.792
'They're all about the death
of Vanessa Prosser.'

03:16.875 --> 03:18.500
(Lilly)
'Who's that?'

03:18.583 --> 03:20.792
Murder victim. 1992.

03:22.250 --> 03:23.750
Never found her killer.

03:29.625 --> 03:30.917
Never say never.

04:02.458 --> 04:03.625
Vanessa Prosser
was a college senior

04:03.709 --> 04:05.458
working on the local
Clinton campaign.

04:05.542 --> 04:08.041
Went to an election
party November 3,
1992.

04:08.125 --> 04:09.375
Washed up on the bank
of the Delaware

04:09.458 --> 04:10.917
the next morning
with a broken neck.

04:11.041 --> 04:13.208
Republicans thought they
had a bad night, huh?

04:13.291 --> 04:16.000
Best guess is she was tossed
from the Ben Franklin Bridge.

04:16.083 --> 04:17.041
Couldn't have been a fall?

04:17.125 --> 04:18.375
Bruising
under
her arms.

04:18.458 --> 04:19.667
Dragged and dumped.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.500
A letter was found
in her pocket.

04:21.583 --> 04:23.208
Signature and most of the
print
was washed away

04:23.291 --> 04:24.542
but a few words are readable.

04:25.875 --> 04:27.291
"Been afraid..

04:27.375 --> 04:28.875
"Wanting to..

04:28.959 --> 04:31.000
Feelings for you.."

04:31.083 --> 04:33.583
- An admirer.
- With good penmanship.

04:33.667 --> 04:36.125
The lead suspect
was Aaron Dutra, Vanessa's ex.

04:36.208 --> 04:37.917
An ROTC Penn grad.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.750
Just gotten back
from the Gulf
War.

04:39.834 --> 04:42.000
And got thrown out
of the party that night.

04:42.083 --> 04:44.166
'Case against him
didn't stick, though.'

04:44.250 --> 04:47.375
Hmm...among other things,
bad penmanship.

04:47.458 --> 04:48.834
(John)
'Where do you think
the letter came from'

04:48.917 --> 04:50.250
'Kleeman, this new victim?'

04:50.333 --> 04:52.208
He had some kind
of obsession with her.

04:52.291 --> 04:54.709
What else do we know
about this guy?

04:54.792 --> 04:57.041
No record, no
warrants.
The man was clean.

04:57.125 --> 04:58.792
(Scotty)
'Can't say the same
for his house.'

04:58.875 --> 05:00.625
Neighbor said the wife died
three years ago.

05:00.709 --> 05:02.125
He turned into a hermit,
let the place go.

05:02.208 --> 05:04.208
And the relationship
between
him and the Prosser girl?

05:04.291 --> 05:05.667
No connections yet
but he did have

05:05.750 --> 05:06.917
some of her personal items.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Receipts, school papers,
journal entries.

05:09.083 --> 05:10.333
Maybe he was stalking her.

05:10.417 --> 05:11.875
But how'd he
get her
stuff?

05:11.959 --> 05:13.917
Walter Sparr was the
assigned on her case.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.041
Will, do you
know
where he is?

05:15.125 --> 05:16.875
Maybe the shore.
I'll find him.

05:16.959 --> 05:20.250
Let's see if Vanessa's parents
know who Kleeman was to her.

05:22.542 --> 05:24.208
No. I-I don't know him.

05:25.667 --> 05:27.542
'Mm, who is he?'

05:27.625 --> 05:29.000
His name is Darren Kleeman.

05:29.083 --> 05:30.875
He was killed last night.

05:30.959 --> 05:32.792
Killed?

05:32.875 --> 05:34.917
Uh, what's this got
to
do with Vanessa?

05:35.000 --> 05:37.125
We were hoping
you could tell
us.

05:37.208 --> 05:38.875
She was living at home, right?

05:38.959 --> 05:41.041
Yes. She was trying
to save money.

05:41.125 --> 05:43.750
She wanted to spend
the summer in Washington.

05:43.834 --> 05:47.083
This man had some of Vanessa's
things at his house.

05:47.166 --> 05:48.875
Well, I don't
understand
how that could be.

05:48.959 --> 05:52.250
Uh, one theory is
Vanessa
was involved with this
guy.

05:52.333 --> 05:56.750
Uh, but he looks like
he's twice her age.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.333
So that might
explain
something.

05:59.417 --> 06:01.583
A few weeks before
Vanessa died..

06:03.041 --> 06:04.500
'...we were making dinner.'

06:04.583 --> 06:06.875
- George Bush is a war hero.
- Oh!

06:06.959 --> 06:09.291
And he doesn't know what
a grocery scanner is.

06:09.375 --> 06:12.458
Well, I, for one,
like that Hillary Clinton.

06:12.542 --> 06:14.208
I liked her headbands,
and I don't know why

06:14.291 --> 06:15.417
'she had to change them.'

06:17.250 --> 06:18.458
Dad, you have to
vote
for Clinton.

06:18.542 --> 06:20.333
I need a job next year.

06:20.417 --> 06:22.166
And never mind
the Gennifer Flowers tapes.

06:22.250 --> 06:24.083
Gennifer Flowers
is a skank.

06:24.166 --> 06:26.041
That's one thing
we can agree on.

06:26.125 --> 06:30.834
Uh-hm. For, uh...Vanessa.

06:30.917 --> 06:33.250
(P.J.)
'Aaron still thinks
he's in the game, huh?'

06:34.875 --> 06:35.959
They're not from Aaron.

06:36.041 --> 06:37.667
No? Who from?

06:37.750 --> 06:40.542
It's just a
thank-you
for the campaign.

06:40.625 --> 06:43.166
- Ho-ho!
- Ah! Ah!

06:43.250 --> 06:45.792
Ooh, ooh, ooh! Apply pressure
here. Direct pressure. Come
on.

06:45.875 --> 06:47.917
Hold on. Grab it, honey.
Hurry up, hurry up. Here we
go.

06:48.000 --> 06:51.291
<i>(P.J.)</i>
<i>And then we got distracted</i>
<i>when she cut herself.</i>

06:51.375 --> 06:53.750
Her blood
didn't
clot properly.

06:55.542 --> 06:58.125
So you never found out
who sent the flowers.

06:58.208 --> 06:59.625
No.

06:59.709 --> 07:01.500
I suppose you didn't
realize
Vanessa was missing

07:01.583 --> 07:03.417
until the next day.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.834
We figured she'd gone back

07:04.917 --> 07:07.834
to her friend's place
on campus, Beth Reardon.

07:07.917 --> 07:09.667
She drove that night.

07:12.875 --> 07:14.500
You build all these?

07:17.417 --> 07:19.166
Just designed them.

07:19.250 --> 07:21.959
I'm the architect,
not the contractor.

07:23.667 --> 07:25.125
I've never seen him before.

07:26.083 --> 07:27.333
Who is he?

07:27.417 --> 07:29.125
Maybe someone Vanessa
was involved with.

07:29.208 --> 07:30.333
I doubt that.

07:30.417 --> 07:32.208
Know a better candidate?

07:32.291 --> 07:34.125
I thought she had
something going on

07:34.208 --> 07:36.166
but she was
being secretive.

07:36.250 --> 07:39.000
Anyone else who might know
who Vanessa was seeing?

07:39.083 --> 07:40.333
Ask Aaron Dutra.

07:40.417 --> 07:42.208
'He was all but stalking her
at the time.'

07:42.291 --> 07:43.709
Her old boyfriend?

07:43.792 --> 07:46.709
She broke up with him but he
wasn't taking no for an
answer.

07:46.792 --> 07:48.875
You see him at the party
that night?

07:48.959 --> 07:51.041
He was hard to miss.

07:51.125 --> 07:52.375
I couldn't vote for Clinton.

07:52.458 --> 07:54.166
I was too jealous
of the Gore girls.

07:54.250 --> 07:55.458
(Vanessa)
'Perot is crazy.'

07:55.542 --> 07:57.208
'He kept dropping
out of the race.'

07:57.291 --> 07:58.834
I liked Stockdale
in the debate.

07:58.917 --> 08:00.333
(Aaron)
'Vanessa!'

08:04.417 --> 08:06.166
Why are you here?

08:06.250 --> 08:08.375
You were supposed
to wait, Vee.

08:08.458 --> 08:09.917
You're drunk.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.041
Shut up.

08:11.125 --> 08:13.709
Aaron, it's over.
I told you this.

08:13.792 --> 08:15.667
I saw you
with
him...today.

08:15.750 --> 08:17.000
You're following me?

08:17.083 --> 08:18.959
I saw him touch
you,
like you're his..

08:19.041 --> 08:19.875
Stop.

08:19.959 --> 08:21.125
- Where is he?
- Aaron

08:21.208 --> 08:22.583
(Aaron)
'Where is he? I know he's
here.'

08:22.667 --> 08:24.417
Aaron, sleep it off.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.625
Cops asked me about him
first time around.

08:35.709 --> 08:38.417
He was an idiot, but..

08:38.500 --> 08:39.917
...not a killer.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.291
You and Aaron
ever compare notes

08:41.375 --> 08:43.041
on who this other
guy
might've been?

08:43.125 --> 08:46.000
Aaron and I
never compared anything.

08:46.083 --> 08:48.792
- He got sick after that.
- Sick?

08:48.875 --> 08:51.041
I heard it was
Gulf War Syndrome.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.375
Sounds like Vanessa's ex
saw her

08:54.458 --> 08:56.250
with her new admirer
the day she died.

08:56.333 --> 08:57.250
You gone to him?

08:57.333 --> 08:58.583
He was too sick
to see us today.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.375
We'll go back tomorrow.

09:00.458 --> 09:02.041
That was Walter Sparr.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.417
He remember the Prosser case?

09:03.500 --> 09:04.750
Remembers Darren Kleeman, too.

09:04.834 --> 09:06.959
'Said he started
coming around a few years
back.'

09:07.041 --> 09:08.959
Had a bunch of theories
on how the girl died.

09:09.041 --> 09:10.667
He came here with theories?

09:10.750 --> 09:13.458
Thought it was some kind
of political conspiracy.

09:13.542 --> 09:16.041
So...he was trying
to solve her murder.

09:16.125 --> 09:17.750
But why was he interested
in Vanessa?

09:17.834 --> 09:19.333
We still don't have
a connection.

09:19.417 --> 09:20.667
Maybe we do.

09:20.750 --> 09:22.250
Remember all the blood
at the Kleeman scene?

09:22.333 --> 09:24.917
The autopsy explains it.
He was a hemophiliac.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.166
Like Vanessa.

09:26.250 --> 09:28.458
- It's hereditary?
- Coroner says yes.

09:28.542 --> 09:31.458
Females are just carriers,
but some show symptoms.

09:31.542 --> 09:33.083
Blood relation.

09:33.166 --> 09:35.500
Vanessa was Darren Kleeman's
daughter?

09:43.041 --> 09:44.375
Yes.

09:44.458 --> 09:45.792
He was Vanessa's father.

09:47.125 --> 09:52.333
Uh, it wasn't...even an
affair.
It was just one night.

09:53.458 --> 09:55.166
You were
already
married?

09:55.250 --> 09:59.041
Darren...was
my high school sweetheart.

09:59.125 --> 10:01.667
We had our ten-year reunion

10:01.750 --> 10:04.750
his pals had a suite upstairs.

10:04.834 --> 10:06.333
Old times' sake?

10:06.417 --> 10:09.709
Stupid...very stupid.

10:09.792 --> 10:13.500
My husband doesn't know,
and neither did Vanessa.

10:14.667 --> 10:16.083
Did Darren keep in touch?

10:16.166 --> 10:19.500
No. No, we'd agreed on that.

10:19.583 --> 10:22.917
We had separate lives
till three years ago.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.333
When he started looking
into Vanessa's death?

10:25.417 --> 10:29.000
His wife had died, said he was
trying to fill the void.

10:29.083 --> 10:31.041
Any idea who he suspected?

10:31.125 --> 10:32.542
(Carol)
'No.'

10:32.625 --> 10:34.500
I let him look
through Vanessa's things

10:34.583 --> 10:37.166
and then I asked him
not to come back.

10:37.250 --> 10:39.041
'I had just lost
my daughter.'

10:39.125 --> 10:41.583
I couldn't risk
losing my husband, too.

10:46.083 --> 10:48.166
If Kleeman was looking
into Vanessa's murder

10:48.250 --> 10:49.709
and got too close
to the truth

10:49.792 --> 10:51.291
that could explain
his death, too.

10:51.375 --> 10:53.875
So we're thinking one
doer for both murders.

10:53.959 --> 10:56.333
We got to find out
what Kleeman knew

10:56.417 --> 10:57.875
who he was after.

10:57.959 --> 10:59.208
Where've you
been, Scotty?

10:59.291 --> 11:01.166
Charming the pants off
a 90-year-old historian

11:01.250 --> 11:02.333
who works for the DNC.

11:02.417 --> 11:03.583
So, you got the photo?

11:03.667 --> 11:05.542
Everyone on the regional
campaign in '92.

11:05.625 --> 11:07.250
Taken the day
of the election.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.709
'Vanessa's ex came to the
party
looking for her new guy.'

11:09.792 --> 11:11.500
Maybe the new
guy is here.

11:15.375 --> 11:16.834
Who's Kite with?

11:17.709 --> 11:18.834
I don't know.

11:20.333 --> 11:23.000
- I thought you and him were--
- Yeah. Yeah. I don't know.

11:25.417 --> 11:27.583
Let's go see if Aaron's
feeling better.

11:31.667 --> 11:34.583
(Aaron)
'Whatever it is,
I was here watching TV.'

11:34.667 --> 11:36.500
It's about Vanessa Prosser.

11:39.291 --> 11:40.709
Of course it is.

11:41.792 --> 11:43.083
The night of her murder,
you showed up

11:43.166 --> 11:45.375
at the election party
pretty upset.

11:45.458 --> 11:47.250
Look at your records.

11:47.333 --> 11:49.625
I've had this
conversation
a hundred times
already.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.750
Let's make it
a hundred and one.

11:51.834 --> 11:54.542
It was the turkey talking.

11:54.625 --> 11:57.667
Bourbon. I'd been
drinking all day.

11:57.750 --> 11:59.667
Can you turn off
the cooking show?

12:04.667 --> 12:07.083
Before I went to the Gulf

12:07.166 --> 12:08.625
'Vanessa and I got engaged.'

12:08.709 --> 12:10.083
When I got back

12:10.166 --> 12:11.625
she was supposed
to be waiting for me.

12:11.709 --> 12:13.625
But instead,
she found someone new.

12:15.917 --> 12:18.458
Could you I.D. her new
boyfriend
from a picture?

12:23.542 --> 12:25.709
Him. Glasses, front.

12:25.792 --> 12:27.959
- You're sure?
- Hundred per cent.

12:34.792 --> 12:36.125
Thanks.

12:39.917 --> 12:40.917
Hi.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.333
Thank you very much.

12:43.375 --> 12:45.959
- I voted. Did you?
- Yeah.

12:46.041 --> 12:48.625
You know, I consider
myself
a reasonably smart guy

12:48.709 --> 12:49.917
but those
ballots
are confusing.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.083
I know. What happens
if you don't knock out

12:52.166 --> 12:53.917
the little square all the way?

12:54.000 --> 12:55.834
Who knows?

13:11.875 --> 13:13.542
David Lake.

13:15.417 --> 13:17.041
I know that name.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.375
Abbey Lake,
Congressman's Chief of Staff.

13:26.458 --> 13:29.208
Detectives Rush and Valens.

13:29.291 --> 13:30.542
Sister, not wife.

13:30.625 --> 13:31.875
Everyone makes that mistake.

13:31.959 --> 13:33.417
We're here
to talk to David.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.542
Oh, I'm sorry,
he's in
Washington.

13:35.625 --> 13:37.208
Maybe I can help?

13:37.291 --> 13:39.250
We're looking
into an old homicide.

13:39.333 --> 13:41.041
Vanessa Prosser.

13:41.125 --> 13:43.208
Oh, that was awful.

13:43.291 --> 13:45.375
She was a really
nice girl.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.625
Oh, we heard she
and your brother

13:46.709 --> 13:47.709
might have been involved.

13:47.792 --> 13:51.000
Her and David? No.

13:51.083 --> 13:52.333
You sure?

13:52.417 --> 13:53.709
A lot of girls on the campaign

13:53.792 --> 13:55.333
were charmed by David.

13:55.417 --> 13:56.750
That's the story of his life.

13:56.834 --> 13:58.291
Occupational hazard.

13:58.375 --> 14:02.917
Vanessa was a lot like
the other girls, that's
all.

14:04.625 --> 14:06.709
- 'Ready?'
- Are we in a hurry?

14:06.792 --> 14:08.875
We have a conference
call
in an hour.

14:09.542 --> 14:11.041
That's right.

14:11.125 --> 14:12.917
- We'll see you at the party?
- David, I have something--

14:13.000 --> 14:14.291
The polls close in four hours.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.166
We need you
on the
phones.

14:16.250 --> 14:18.041
Final push.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.250
You'll see him tonight, Vanessa.

14:24.667 --> 14:28.333
She was sweet,
but young...naive.

14:28.417 --> 14:29.542
Star struck.

14:30.458 --> 14:31.917
David's only human.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.458
He gets flattered.

14:33.542 --> 14:36.959
Part of my job was
and is keeping him
focused.

14:37.041 --> 14:39.458
Well, we'd still really
like
to talk to your brother.

14:41.250 --> 14:43.125
As soon as he's back in town.

14:43.208 --> 14:45.625
I'm here at the local
Democratic election party

14:45.709 --> 14:48.375
where hundreds of volunteers
have helped Bill Clinton..

14:48.458 --> 14:49.834
11:15, election night.

14:51.083 --> 14:52.959
'Abbey Lake, David's sister.'

14:53.041 --> 14:55.000
And the future Congressman
himself.

14:55.083 --> 14:56.625
(woman on TV)
'with lots of hope and..'

14:56.709 --> 14:58.583
No Vanessa, though.

14:58.667 --> 15:00.250
Could be out of frame.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.709
Could be dead.

15:01.792 --> 15:03.625
We think Lake had
a relationship with
Vanessa?

15:03.709 --> 15:04.834
His sister
says no.

15:04.917 --> 15:06.625
Well, we'll see if
his handwriting matches

15:06.709 --> 15:07.917
that letter found on her body.

15:08.000 --> 15:09.291
Be delicate, Scotty.

15:09.375 --> 15:10.917
He runs to his friends
in the Mayor's Office

15:11.000 --> 15:12.792
I'm the one who
gets the call.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.417
What else do we
know about him?

15:14.500 --> 15:15.792
Been in Washington
since '92.

15:15.875 --> 15:17.625
Elected to Congress
two years ago.

15:17.709 --> 15:21.291
Went to Princeton, Columbia
Law.
Raised up north, in Redding.

15:21.375 --> 15:22.625
(Nick)
'Redding!'

15:22.709 --> 15:24.166
Yeah.

15:24.250 --> 15:27.875
My victim made a couple calls
to Redding the day he got
shot.

15:27.959 --> 15:29.208
Kleeman did?

15:29.291 --> 15:31.291
Yeah, to a guy
named Marvin Dobie.

15:38.750 --> 15:40.166
Marvin Dobie?

15:40.250 --> 15:42.208
Philadelphia Homicide.

15:42.291 --> 15:43.333
Yeah, so?

15:43.417 --> 15:45.375
Hey, nice...custom job.

15:45.458 --> 15:49.000
Bamboo rod. Tail water reel..
Expensive hobby.

15:49.083 --> 15:52.166
Convictions for fraud,
forgery, bad checks..

15:52.250 --> 15:54.333
Which of those hobbies
got you that rod?

15:54.417 --> 15:55.959
What do you want from me?

15:57.291 --> 15:58.917
You know a guy
named Darren Kleeman?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.250
Nah.

16:00.333 --> 16:02.166
Really? He called you
last week.

16:02.250 --> 16:03.583
Well, maybe he
got
a wrong number.

16:03.667 --> 16:05.375
You talk to wrong numbers
for six minutes?

16:05.458 --> 16:06.709
Maybe I got lonely.

16:06.792 --> 16:08.667
Kleeman got killed
later that day.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.542
Know anything about that?

16:10.625 --> 16:11.875
Dead? Boo.

16:11.959 --> 16:14.166
Know him now?

16:14.250 --> 16:15.417
(Will)
'How about her?'

16:15.500 --> 16:17.083
'Name's Vanessa Prosser.'

16:17.166 --> 16:19.625
Sorry. Anyone else?

16:19.709 --> 16:21.875
(Nick)
'How about
Congressman David Lake?'

16:21.959 --> 16:24.083
Yeah, of him.
He's from the neighborhood.

16:24.166 --> 16:25.458
You friendly?

16:25.542 --> 16:27.500
Marvin
'I wouldn't say that.'

16:27.583 --> 16:29.500
Look, I got to get
to the scrap yard.

16:29.583 --> 16:30.750
'This your writing?'

16:32.834 --> 16:34.208
Ah, no, man.
That's the
architect.

16:34.291 --> 16:35.834
They all write like that.

16:38.375 --> 16:41.041
Old set of blueprints
from Dobie. Check out the
print.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.917
Here's the letter
from Vanessa's pocket.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.250
'Compare the two.'

16:44.333 --> 16:46.417
Dobie 's architect wrote
Vanessa a love letter?

16:46.500 --> 16:47.625
They almost match.

16:47.709 --> 16:49.542
Almost. This is called
"lettering."

16:49.625 --> 16:52.000
You look at any set of plans,
it basically looks like this.

16:52.083 --> 16:53.583
All architects
print this way for clarity

16:53.667 --> 16:55.166
so it's hard to tell one
from the next.

16:55.250 --> 16:57.792
But we only got one
architect
in this investigation.

16:57.875 --> 17:00.291
Mm-hm...Beth Reardon.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
Where did you find this?

17:11.083 --> 17:13.375
It was in Vanessa's pocket.

17:13.458 --> 17:15.125
It's your writing, isn't it?

17:17.417 --> 17:20.458
I guess I was...
kind of in love with
her.

17:24.125 --> 17:26.250
It's my fault she died.

17:26.333 --> 17:28.291
Why do you say that?

17:28.375 --> 17:29.917
We went outside.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.333
I knew something
was bothering her.

17:39.041 --> 17:40.917
Don't worry about Aaron.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.166
He'll regret it all
in the morning.

17:43.250 --> 17:44.667
I'm not.

17:46.959 --> 17:49.125
Then what are you
worried about?

17:52.458 --> 17:54.333
You're not
telling me something.

17:57.709 --> 18:01.125
Do you ever wish you
could just...go
backwards

18:01.208 --> 18:04.792
and...unlearn something?

18:04.875 --> 18:06.166
Like?

18:10.083 --> 18:12.917
I just want
things
to be simple..

18:13.000 --> 18:14.667
...but they're a mess.

18:18.750 --> 18:20.375
Tell me what you mean.

18:22.792 --> 18:24.291
I can't.

18:37.208 --> 18:39.291
- Beth!
- I'm sorry.

18:41.625 --> 18:43.291
I don't know what to say.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.000
Don't say anything.

18:53.709 --> 18:55.166
Just read.

19:02.917 --> 19:05.166
I was her ride that night.

19:05.250 --> 19:07.083
If I hadn't left..

19:07.166 --> 19:09.041
...maybe she'd still be alive.

19:09.125 --> 19:10.333
You told the first detectives

19:10.417 --> 19:12.542
you were home the rest
of the night.

19:12.625 --> 19:14.166
Passed out on my bathroom floor.

19:14.250 --> 19:15.375
So no alibi, then.

19:15.458 --> 19:17.208
That's my alibi.

19:17.291 --> 19:18.542
That's where I was.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.709
How about this past
Thursday night?

19:20.792 --> 19:22.917
I...was in the E.R.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.458
My son had an asthma attack.

19:25.542 --> 19:28.709
Did Vanessa ever mention
the name Marvin Dobie?

19:28.792 --> 19:30.583
(Scotty)
'Ex-con from Redding.'

19:30.667 --> 19:31.750
No bells?

19:31.834 --> 19:33.709
Redding..

19:33.792 --> 19:35.500
She took a bus to Reading

19:35.583 --> 19:37.250
a few days before the election.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.041
She say why?

19:40.125 --> 19:43.625
I heard her on the phone,
checking schedules.

19:43.709 --> 19:48.041
When I asked her about it...
she changed the subject.

19:48.125 --> 19:51.250
(Lilly)
'Darren Kleeman calls Dobie
in Reading, ends up dead.'

19:51.333 --> 19:53.125
Vanessa goes
to Redding..

19:53.208 --> 19:55.083
Probably to contact Dobie.

19:55.166 --> 19:56.458
Same ending.

19:56.542 --> 19:58.250
All roads
lead
to Redding.

19:58.333 --> 19:59.917
Congressman's hometown.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.375
Believe me, I understand
the need for low income housing

20:02.458 --> 20:05.333
I come from humble
beginnings,
and if it were up to me

20:05.417 --> 20:07.041
we'd break ground tomorrow.

20:07.125 --> 20:11.959
But we just simply don't
have the resources.

20:12.041 --> 20:13.625
<i>Me siento mucho.</i>

20:15.583 --> 20:17.458
He just told them
he "sits down a lot."

20:17.542 --> 20:20.083
<i>Gracias. Gracias.</i>
Thank you for coming.

20:22.208 --> 20:23.959
How are you?

20:24.041 --> 20:26.792
(David)
'Uh, Vanessa and I worked
on the campaign together.'

20:26.875 --> 20:28.208
That all you did together?

20:30.041 --> 20:31.959
We hear you may have
been more than coworkers.

20:32.041 --> 20:33.709
Excuse me.

20:33.792 --> 20:35.000
Just had Lasik.

20:35.083 --> 20:37.875
Put it off as
long as I
could.

20:37.959 --> 20:40.125
20/400 in both eyes.

20:40.208 --> 20:41.667
Contacts never
seem to fit
right.

20:41.750 --> 20:44.375
Uh-hm. This a filibuster,
Congressman?

20:46.333 --> 20:47.250
Okay.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.333
Vanessa and I were involved.

20:49.417 --> 20:50.959
(Lilly)
'But you kept it quiet.'

20:51.041 --> 20:53.166
We don't want people
on the campaign to
know.

20:53.250 --> 20:54.959
And after Vanessa died?

20:55.041 --> 20:56.667
My coming forward
wouldn't have
helped.

20:56.750 --> 20:58.750
<i>you.</i>

20:58.834 --> 21:00.500
I had no information

21:00.583 --> 21:02.083
and

21:02.166 --> 21:03.917
being associated
with
an event like that.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.667
Even though it was your
girlfriend that got killed?

21:06.750 --> 21:08.625
She wasn't, though.

21:08.709 --> 21:10.792
We broke things off that night.

21:16.750 --> 21:19.041
You've been avoiding me?

21:19.125 --> 21:21.041
No, I think you
have that
reversed.

21:22.250 --> 21:24.667
Where's your friend?

21:24.750 --> 21:26.625
She went home.

21:26.709 --> 21:28.834
And the ex-boyfriend?

21:28.917 --> 21:31.458
Don't know...don't care.

21:33.417 --> 21:36.500
Vee, I've been offered
a position..

21:36.583 --> 21:38.083
...in Washington.

21:39.834 --> 21:41.333
That's great!

21:42.625 --> 21:44.333
This is what you wanted.

21:46.583 --> 21:47.875
Yeah.

21:48.709 --> 21:50.166
The thing is..

21:51.667 --> 21:53.667
'...it wouldn't make sense
for us to..'

21:55.834 --> 21:57.834
...to make this long-distance.

22:00.792 --> 22:03.208
I thought the idea
was that we were gonna go

22:03.291 --> 22:05.500
to Washington
together,
not break up.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.542
Things have a way of turning
on a dime in this business.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.500
Is it because of Abbey?

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
What did Abbey have
to do with it?

22:23.083 --> 22:24.375
She was always

22:24.458 --> 22:27.750
worried about loose ends
with the girls I dated.

22:27.834 --> 22:31.625
You ever get back to your
humble beginnings in Reading?

22:31.709 --> 22:33.333
Not really. No time.

22:33.417 --> 22:35.125
'Cause Vanessa did.

22:35.208 --> 22:37.250
Went to see a guy
named Marvin Dobey.

22:37.333 --> 22:40.500
Hmm, I don't know
the name.

22:40.583 --> 22:42.458
Says he lived
in your neighborhood.

22:42.542 --> 22:46.333
And I pride myself on my
ability to remember
people.

22:49.083 --> 22:50.917
Thanks for being
frank with us.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.375
If there's one thing I
learned from Bill
Clinton

22:53.458 --> 22:56.166
never lie about
that sort of
thing.

22:58.583 --> 23:01.041
Maybe, he didn't lie
about Vanessa.

23:01.125 --> 23:03.792
- He lied about Dobey.
- You found a connection?

23:03.875 --> 23:05.792
Yeah, I pulled the forms
to
see who posted bail

23:05.875 --> 23:08.375
on Dobey's
arrests.
Fraud, '77.

23:08.458 --> 23:10.792
$5,000 bond posted
by Linda Syverson.

23:10.875 --> 23:12.000
Who's that?

23:12.083 --> 23:13.458
Got her own record,
for prostitution

23:13.542 --> 23:14.625
but only once
under that name.

23:14.709 --> 23:16.208
In her married years,
she was known as--

23:16.291 --> 23:18.875
- Linda Lake.
- Mother of David and Abbey.

23:18.959 --> 23:20.583
What does she have to do
with Dobey?

23:20.667 --> 23:23.792
Shared an address for a
year.
Probably, her boyfriend.

23:23.875 --> 23:27.125
So Dobey didn't live in the
same
neighborhood as David Lake

23:27.208 --> 23:28.500
he lived in the same house.

23:28.583 --> 23:30.750
And Lake couldn't
place the name.

23:30.834 --> 23:32.250
Which is doubly
curious, considering

23:32.333 --> 23:33.709
the checks he's been writing.

23:33.792 --> 23:35.208
Marvin Dobey
has been
getting

23:35.291 --> 23:38.125
payments from a trust
since the late '80s.

23:38.208 --> 23:39.959
A trust set up
by David Lake.

23:40.041 --> 23:43.000
And the congressman's giving
Dobey financial support?

23:43.083 --> 23:45.250
But what is Dobey giving him?

23:47.917 --> 23:49.291
You said you didn't know
Darren Kleeman.

23:49.375 --> 23:50.834
(Lilly)
'Or Vanessa Prosser.'

23:50.917 --> 23:52.834
We think you did, though,
and now they're both dead.

23:52.917 --> 23:54.041
Not 'cause of me.

23:54.125 --> 23:55.542
'Cause of something
you know, then.

23:55.625 --> 23:57.834
You also lied
about Congressman Lake.

23:57.917 --> 23:59.917
Not only did you
know him

24:00.000 --> 24:02.375
you lived in his house
when he was a teenager.

24:02.458 --> 24:03.834
I ain't talking about Lake.

24:03.917 --> 24:05.667
Don't want them checks
to stop coming.

24:05.750 --> 24:07.542
(Lilly)
'Someone's going away
for this girl's murder.'

24:07.625 --> 24:08.959
'Comes down
to you or Lake.'

24:09.041 --> 24:10.500
Who do you think gets
the benefit of the doubt?

24:10.583 --> 24:13.000
The congressman
or the ex-con?

24:15.375 --> 24:19.291
Lake has resources,
lawyers, status.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.834
- What have you got?
- Self-respect.

24:21.917 --> 24:24.125
That's more than he can say.

24:28.834 --> 24:32.500
You tell me I don't get rung
up
on some extortion rap

24:32.583 --> 24:35.083
and I tell you
what you wanna know.

24:36.917 --> 24:40.041
I think we can sell
that to the DA.

24:40.125 --> 24:41.959
'Kleeman called me up'

24:42.041 --> 24:44.208
said he found my name
in this girl's stuff.

24:44.291 --> 24:47.041
How that happened,
I don't know.

24:47.125 --> 24:48.375
Okay.

24:48.458 --> 24:50.542
He asked what I knew
about her getting killed.

24:50.625 --> 24:53.041
- What'd you tell him?
- Nothing to tell.

24:53.125 --> 24:55.208
I didn't know she was dead.

24:57.959 --> 25:01.041
I met her that one time.
That's all I knew of her.

25:01.125 --> 25:04.250
So Vanessa did visit
you in '92.

25:05.208 --> 25:07.208
I don't know
how
she found me.

25:07.291 --> 25:10.583
She just showed up
at my door, out of the
blue.

25:11.959 --> 25:14.208
Why does David Lake
send you money?

25:14.291 --> 25:16.083
David who, darlin'?

25:16.166 --> 25:17.250
Look, I'm not looking
for trouble.

25:17.333 --> 25:19.750
I just, I just wanna
know why.

25:26.500 --> 25:29.583
I don't know what
you're talking about.

25:29.667 --> 25:31.667
He writes you checks.

25:31.750 --> 25:33.542
I've seen them.

25:34.750 --> 25:37.041
Are you some kind
of reporter?

25:37.125 --> 25:39.834
No. A friend.

25:45.542 --> 25:47.250
You go home, little girl.

25:47.333 --> 25:50.750
Buy yourself some shoes,
take your mind off of things.

25:50.834 --> 25:53.083
I don't know what
you're doing

25:53.166 --> 25:55.792
but I know enough
to call the police.

26:04.041 --> 26:06.500
Why don't you
just ask David?

26:07.333 --> 26:09.000
I did.

26:09.083 --> 26:11.083
He won't tell me
anything.

26:15.625 --> 26:18.333
You're more than just
a friend of his, aren't you?

26:19.959 --> 26:21.750
Oh, God.

26:21.834 --> 26:24.333
I almost feel bad for you.

26:31.083 --> 26:34.000
Why did you
feel bad for her?

26:34.083 --> 26:36.208
She was in over her head.

26:36.291 --> 26:40.375
See, David
and his sister Abbey..

26:42.125 --> 26:45.625
...they were more
than friends, too.

26:52.917 --> 26:55.083
- Brother and sister?
- Yeah.

26:56.750 --> 26:58.667
Uh, yeah.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.959
Dobey caught them a few times
while he was living with them.

27:01.041 --> 27:03.667
- He have proof?
- What? Like pictures?

27:03.750 --> 27:05.667
- Yeah.
- 'No. No pictures.'

27:05.750 --> 27:07.333
But David and Abbey
were worried enough

27:07.417 --> 27:09.208
to be paying him off
the past 20 years.

27:09.291 --> 27:11.500
Man...I voted for this guy.

27:11.583 --> 27:13.375
Dobey told Vanessa Prosser
about it.

27:13.458 --> 27:16.250
We think she went
and confronted the happy
couple.

27:16.333 --> 27:17.625
And got killed for it.

27:17.709 --> 27:19.500
And last week, Dobey called
the congressman

27:19.583 --> 27:21.625
to report that Darren Kleeman
was sniffing around.

27:21.709 --> 27:24.208
Few hours later, Kleeman ends
up
with two in the head.

27:24.291 --> 27:25.709
But Lake was in DC that day.

27:25.792 --> 27:28.542
No, Dobey says
Abbey took the call.

27:28.625 --> 27:30.917
So you think Abbey
did both jobs?

27:31.000 --> 27:35.375
When it comes to her brother,
Abbey takes care of
everything.

27:35.458 --> 27:37.750
Now, Dobey's got a sheet
like War and Peace, Kite.

27:37.834 --> 27:39.834
He could be compelled
to testify.

27:39.917 --> 27:42.709
Hearsay from a repeat
felon
won't buy you much.

27:42.792 --> 27:46.291
You wanna get our murderer,
you gotta get her to talk.

27:48.417 --> 27:49.750
(Abbey)
'I didn't kill anyone.'

27:49.834 --> 27:52.333
But what would give you
an idea like that?

27:52.417 --> 27:55.458
Not what. Who.

27:55.542 --> 27:59.166
Acquaintance of yours.
Kind of an in-law,
actually.

27:59.250 --> 28:00.625
Marvin Dobey.

28:01.959 --> 28:04.583
What rock did he crawl
out from under?

28:04.667 --> 28:07.208
You should know.
you paid for it.

28:07.291 --> 28:10.250
Hush money couldn't
keep him quiet,
though.

28:10.333 --> 28:11.875
Your own brother, Abbey?

28:11.959 --> 28:13.291
My own brother, what?

28:13.375 --> 28:15.417
When it gets out David Lake
took advantage

28:15.500 --> 28:17.417
of his sister
when they were teenagers..

28:17.500 --> 28:18.709
It'll finish him.

28:18.792 --> 28:20.417
Do you have any idea
how that sounds?

28:20.500 --> 28:24.500
I know how it's gonna read.
National Enquirer, Star--

28:24.583 --> 28:25.917
The gyp papers too.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.583
They'll stop the
presses
for this one.

28:27.667 --> 28:29.750
That would be slander.
We'd sue you.

28:29.834 --> 28:33.625
But by that time,
<i>everyone will know.</i>

28:35.000 --> 28:36.750
Can't unring a bell.

28:36.834 --> 28:39.875
(Scotty)
'That charming brother of
yours
won't have a career left.'

28:39.959 --> 28:42.291
(Lilly)
'Maybe, that's what
Abbey wants..'

28:42.375 --> 28:44.583
...to have her favorite guy
all to herself.

28:45.959 --> 28:48.125
That's why you killed Vanessa,
isn't it?

28:48.208 --> 28:49.917
What do you say, Abbey?

28:50.000 --> 28:53.125
'We call up
the gossip rags, or..'

28:53.208 --> 28:54.709
...you start spilling.

28:57.041 --> 28:58.542
Okay.

29:00.375 --> 29:02.458
I need assurances.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.458
What kind?

29:11.542 --> 29:14.667
You keep certain
things
out of the press.

29:14.750 --> 29:16.166
They'll come out at trial.

29:16.250 --> 29:18.542
Not if I plead guilty.

29:21.917 --> 29:25.083
David didn't take
advantage
of me. I was older.

29:26.792 --> 29:29.083
It was me.

29:29.166 --> 29:31.834
And Vanessa found this out?

29:31.917 --> 29:34.125
She should've minded
her own business.

29:35.834 --> 29:37.917
Adams Morgan?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.583
How about Georgetown?

29:41.542 --> 29:44.000
It'd be so great if we could
work at the White House.

29:44.083 --> 29:47.166
Assuming Clinton wins.

29:47.250 --> 29:50.083
(Vanessa)
'We could get
an apartment together.'

29:50.166 --> 29:52.917
- Dog?
- Cat.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.208
Both.

29:55.291 --> 29:58.250
I want to go to every museum
on the Mall.

29:58.333 --> 30:00.667
It's a easy train trip
back to Philly.

30:00.750 --> 30:03.250
Oh, it would be great, Vee.

30:20.500 --> 30:22.542
- Abbey.
- Hi. Sorry.

30:22.625 --> 30:25.500
It's late, I know.

30:25.583 --> 30:27.542
How long have you
been standing
there?

30:27.625 --> 30:30.208
What do you mean?
I just got here.

30:31.959 --> 30:34.083
I need you to sign
some checks.

30:36.208 --> 30:37.583
$6,000 now?

30:37.667 --> 30:39.125
(Abbey)
'That's his new number.'

30:39.208 --> 30:41.000
(David)
'Tell him forget it.'

30:41.083 --> 30:44.709
We can't let him
keep
raising the amount.

30:44.792 --> 30:48.583
You want a future
in the public eye..

30:48.667 --> 30:50.166
...you pay him.

31:04.875 --> 31:07.917
That would get a girl curious.

31:08.000 --> 31:11.291
If I'd been more successful
at deflecting her..

31:14.000 --> 31:16.583
I wouldn't have had to do
what I did.

31:16.667 --> 31:18.166
Which was?

31:18.250 --> 31:20.667
I sent her down the stairs
of the hotel parking garage

31:20.750 --> 31:22.834
then dumped
her from the
bridge.

31:22.917 --> 31:26.000
All for David's
brilliant career.

31:26.083 --> 31:27.959
I owed him.

31:28.041 --> 31:30.667
For what I did
when we were young.

31:32.959 --> 31:35.625
And David agreed
to sweep this under the rug?

31:35.709 --> 31:38.500
- He doesn't know anything.
- 'What about Kleeman?'

31:38.583 --> 31:40.208
Doesn't know
about him,
either.

31:40.291 --> 31:41.709
So you admit to shooting him?

31:41.792 --> 31:45.417
Two shots. He was as
close
as you are right now.

31:46.375 --> 31:48.125
That was your .38?

31:49.417 --> 31:51.750
It was a .25.

31:51.834 --> 31:53.875
You can find it
in my apartment.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.583
Hey, got her gun.

31:56.667 --> 31:58.333
Ballistics will
test
fire and compare

31:58.417 --> 31:59.667
but she looks
good for it.

31:59.750 --> 32:01.041
Well, that'll make
the bosses happy.

32:01.125 --> 32:02.458
Better her than
the congressman.

32:02.542 --> 32:04.291
They were getting
nervous upstairs,
huh?

32:04.375 --> 32:06.667
Can I show you something?

32:13.000 --> 32:14.583
He ain't wearing his glasses.

32:16.959 --> 32:18.834
- So?
- So..

32:20.667 --> 32:22.166
'...where'd they go?'

32:22.250 --> 32:24.250
I lose mine three
times a day, Scotty.

32:24.333 --> 32:28.667
You're not blind without them.
Lake said he had 20/400 vision.

32:28.750 --> 32:30.250
What's the theory?

32:30.333 --> 32:33.208
Maybe, he lost them
in a struggle.

32:33.291 --> 32:34.875
(Scotty)
'Abbey's taking the fall.'

32:34.959 --> 32:37.125
'In her twisted devotion
to David she figures better'

32:37.208 --> 32:41.542
to let him go on, doin' all
his
good. She'll sit in jail.

32:41.625 --> 32:43.542
- That's a little thin.
- It makes sense.

32:43.625 --> 32:45.041
Scotty, we got
nothing on him.

32:45.125 --> 32:48.208
- I know he did it.
- But we can't make the case.

32:48.291 --> 32:51.083
Sooner or later, Scotty,
one's gonna get by you.

32:53.125 --> 32:54.959
Happens to us all.

32:58.625 --> 33:01.125
I wanna go see Lake
one more time.

33:03.333 --> 33:05.542
(David)
'I don't know who
Darren Kleeman is.'

33:05.625 --> 33:07.875
He was Vanessa's
real father.

33:07.959 --> 33:09.542
He was looking into
her death.

33:09.625 --> 33:12.083
Which means
he was looking into you.

33:14.125 --> 33:17.375
- You think I killed Vanessa?
- Leanin' there.

33:17.458 --> 33:20.125
Except your sister says
she did it.

33:20.208 --> 33:23.083
- She said that?
- 'Made a deal.'

33:23.166 --> 33:24.458
Copped to both murders.

33:24.542 --> 33:27.291
In exchange, we don't leak
your dirty little secret.

33:29.417 --> 33:30.750
I have to call Abbey.

33:30.834 --> 33:33.667
Without your help,
she's looking at life.

33:34.959 --> 33:36.250
How can I help?

33:36.333 --> 33:38.667
Tell us what happened
to Vanessa.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.458
I don't know.

33:41.583 --> 33:44.166
You know.

33:55.792 --> 33:57.375
Excuse me.

34:03.166 --> 34:05.917
I don't have anything
more to say.

34:12.083 --> 34:13.500
He almost went
in there.

34:13.583 --> 34:15.959
Know that call Stillman didn't
want to get from the brass?

34:16.041 --> 34:17.375
He got it.

34:17.458 --> 34:19.625
We have to leave Lake alone.

34:19.709 --> 34:21.625
Commissioner's orders.

34:30.542 --> 34:33.709
Hey, hey, heard you went back
at the congressman.

34:33.792 --> 34:36.709
[sighs]
Yeah, till the
bosses
shut us down.

34:36.792 --> 34:38.792
Got a pretty good case
against his sister.

34:38.875 --> 34:42.750
Yeah, must be nice having
a different set of rules.

34:44.458 --> 34:47.250
I saw you with that new ADA.

34:47.333 --> 34:50.166
- Julie?
- Yeah, Julie.

34:52.250 --> 34:54.792
Actually, I'm on my way
to meet her now.

34:54.875 --> 34:58.500
- Have fun.
- Rush! Rush!

35:01.417 --> 35:03.542
I'll cut her loose right now
if it's just you and me

35:03.625 --> 35:05.417
but I haven't heard
that from you.

35:06.667 --> 35:10.291
- So until you've decided
that--
- Okay. Okay.

35:11.375 --> 35:14.917
- Okay what?
- Just you and me.

35:29.041 --> 35:34.291
Then, um, I'll go,
uh,
meet her right now.

35:35.417 --> 35:37.208
Uh, be polite
for an hour.

35:37.291 --> 35:40.709
Then tell her that
I'm otherwise
engaged.

35:40.792 --> 35:42.583
Okay.

35:54.792 --> 35:56.208
Okay.

36:05.083 --> 36:06.583
Congressman.

36:06.667 --> 36:08.375
You're not allowed
to be here.

36:08.458 --> 36:09.917
I'm off duty.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.917
- Just two guys talking.
- I don't think so.

36:14.291 --> 36:16.291
Your life's
pretty
important, huh?

36:18.709 --> 36:20.750
Everyone's life is important.

36:20.834 --> 36:24.375
Not Vanessa's,
apparently.
Or Abbey's.

36:24.458 --> 36:27.417
What kind of man lets
his
sister take his bullet?

36:27.500 --> 36:28.959
You don't know about
Abbey and me.

36:29.041 --> 36:31.083
I know more than
I wanna know.

36:32.125 --> 36:34.417
We had a hard upbringing.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.875
Yeah, humble beginnings.

36:35.959 --> 36:39.917
It was a lot worse than humble.

36:40.000 --> 36:44.166
It made us very close.
I can't make you understand.

36:44.250 --> 36:45.917
Yeah, I don't need
to
understand that.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.875
I just want the truth
about
Vanessa, how she died.

36:54.875 --> 36:56.041
Well, You got
a law degree,
right?

36:56.125 --> 36:57.625
- You know about Miranda.
- Yeah.

36:57.709 --> 36:59.375
Well, I haven't Mirandized
you.
so anything you

36:59.458 --> 37:03.333
tell me right now, I can't
use
in court. You're
protected.

37:03.417 --> 37:05.834
And we can have
a conversation.

37:08.625 --> 37:11.500
- About what?
- The truth.

37:11.583 --> 37:13.583
Why would you
wanna know something

37:13.667 --> 37:15.792
you could do nothing about?

37:15.875 --> 37:17.792
That's for me to know.

37:17.875 --> 37:21.709
What you need to know is I
ain't
leavin' till you tell me.

37:33.583 --> 37:38.125
I thought that
she had left the party.

37:38.208 --> 37:41.166
I never expected
to see her again.

37:43.875 --> 37:47.417
Vanessa, what are
you doing here?

37:48.917 --> 37:51.750
I went to
Reading
this weekend.

37:51.834 --> 37:53.750
I met Marvin Dobey.

37:56.291 --> 37:58.000
Why would you do that?

37:58.083 --> 38:01.583
I just wanted to know
what
was coming between us.

38:03.208 --> 38:05.709
What did he say?

38:05.792 --> 38:09.250
- It doesn't matter.
- What did he say?

38:11.125 --> 38:14.917
He told
me...about
you and Abbey.

38:18.625 --> 38:20.917
But it's alright.

38:23.792 --> 38:27.333
Vanessa, we can't.
I can't.

38:28.375 --> 38:31.000
We can.
We can be
together.

38:31.083 --> 38:33.959
You just have to look
forward and not back.

38:35.542 --> 38:37.166
I love you.

38:42.583 --> 38:44.000
I can't!

38:49.125 --> 38:50.375
Vee?

38:52.667 --> 38:54.208
Oh, God. Vanessa!

38:58.583 --> 39:00.291
Oh, God.

39:12.333 --> 39:15.000
Abbey?

39:15.083 --> 39:17.166
Abbey, I screwed up.
