00:10.840 --> 00:14.360
All right, everyone, on your toes.
Major Gant, report.

00:14.480 --> 00:18.480
A ship just exited a hyperspace window.
Goa'uld vessel. Ha'tak class.

00:18.600 --> 00:23.840
- Sound general quarters.
- Goa'uld vessel is closing on our position.

00:23.920 --> 00:29.200
Shields at maximum. Load missile bays
and charge the primary weapons system.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.120
(alarm)

00:33.440 --> 00:35.520
Excuse me

00:36.960 --> 00:38.320
That's annoying.

00:38.440 --> 00:41.520
Colonel Ronson has issued a call
for battle stations.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.040
Again.

00:43.120 --> 00:45.680
Aren't we participating in damage control?

00:45.800 --> 00:49.520
Yes, and if there's ever any damage,
l'll do my best to control it.

00:49.640 --> 00:51.760
Right now l wanna talk to Ronson.

00:54.640 --> 00:59.920
- Goa'uld vessel is within range, sir.
- Weapons Officer, prepare to fire.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.880
He's weapons officer.
You'd think he'd be prepared.

01:02.960 --> 01:03.920
lndeed.

01:04.040 --> 01:07.320
The bridge isn't where you should be
during a battle drill.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.680
No. l've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.520
Can it wait until
we're not in the middle of a drill?

01:13.600 --> 01:17.320
When are we not in the middle of a drill?

01:19.480 --> 01:22.320
OK. We'll talk about it later.

01:22.440 --> 01:25.360
Teal'c, prepare to assist
in damage control.

01:25.440 --> 01:28.800
- l am prepared, O'Neill.
- See how melodramatic that sounds?

01:28.880 --> 01:31.040
lt's unnecessary.

01:35.120 --> 01:37.200
Where were we?

01:39.000 --> 01:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:41.080 --> 02:44.240
Sir, l feel like
we're getting in the way here.

02:44.360 --> 02:49.600
SG-1 has valuable experience with both
hyperspace travel and the ''Prometheus''.

02:49.680 --> 02:55.840
Besides, your mission to P7X-009
shouldn't take more than a few hours.

02:55.960 --> 02:59.040
General Greer and l
just want you there for the shakedown.

02:59.120 --> 03:03.040
- ln the unlikely event of an emergency?
- Something like that.

03:03.160 --> 03:06.000
Enjoy the ride, Colonel. Hammond out.

03:08.960 --> 03:12.560
This is Prometheus
requesting go-ahead for mission start.

03:12.680 --> 03:17.440
This is Vandenberg. You've an affirmative
for hyperspace window activation.

03:17.520 --> 03:21.040
Roger that. Major, we have a go.

03:21.160 --> 03:23.760
Yes, sir. Activating window.

03:34.160 --> 03:37.760
Run level-one diagnostics
on all weapons systems.

03:37.840 --> 03:39.840
- Ring transport?
- Hit all of them.

03:39.920 --> 03:44.400
Also set up a hull-breach simulation
for 0500. That's all.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.480
Yes, sir.

03:47.240 --> 03:48.800
Jack.

03:52.200 --> 03:54.480
You've got a fine crew here, Ronson.

03:54.560 --> 03:58.240
- You've got a pretty solid team yourself.
- Speaking of that...

03:58.360 --> 04:02.720
Jack, l know that in the event
of a real situation with the Goa'uld,

04:02.800 --> 04:04.800
you feel your place is on the bridge.

04:04.880 --> 04:08.640
You'd be a fool not to take advantage
of Teal'c's expertise.

04:08.760 --> 04:13.760
You're absolutely right, but you're
just along for the shakedown cruise.

04:13.880 --> 04:19.360
My crew needs to be able to count on me
and on each other after you're gone.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.519
l guess l can respect that.

04:21.640 --> 04:24.640
Besides, l highly doubt
we'll run into the Goa'uld.

04:28.160 --> 04:31.000
We just dropped out of hyperspace.

04:32.080 --> 04:34.080
Carter, Teal'c, meet me on the bridge.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.760
- Major?
- We were supposed to be in hyperspace

04:39.880 --> 04:43.200
for another 90 minutes, sir.
l don't know what happened.

04:43.280 --> 04:47.720
- What's our position?
- 40.62 light years short of the target, sir.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.360
Something caused the hyperdrive
to shut down.

04:50.440 --> 04:54.720
That would only happen if the computer
detected instability in the naquadria.

04:54.840 --> 04:59.280
He's right, sir. Diagnostics show
a massive power surge in the hyperdrive.

04:59.400 --> 05:03.280
- Have you begun restart procedures?
- The computer won't allow start-up.

05:04.720 --> 05:07.040
Carter?

05:07.160 --> 05:10.080
- You promised me it would work.
- lt did work.

05:10.160 --> 05:14.280
- No, it didn't.
- The hyperdrive was fitted with a buffer,

05:14.400 --> 05:18.320
designed to modulate fluctuations
in energy from the naquadria.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.280
- This shouldn't be happening.
- Yet it is happening.

05:21.400 --> 05:24.920
- Yet it is.
- Something must've damaged the buffer.

05:25.040 --> 05:29.040
- Sir, with your permission, l'd like to look.
- Yeah. Me too.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.000
Take Major Gant.
Report back to me as soon as possible.

05:32.120 --> 05:34.080
Yes, sir.

05:37.560 --> 05:41.320
We were right. Something caused
the buffer to overload. lt's fried.

05:41.440 --> 05:44.720
But it was created
to handle massive amounts of energy.

05:44.840 --> 05:47.840
Gravity waves.
l just checked the ship's sensor log.

05:47.920 --> 05:51.600
We passed through an intense
gravity wave from a collapsing star.

05:51.680 --> 05:53.760
That would explain it.

05:53.840 --> 05:56.560
But the engines are intact
and we have naquadria.

05:56.640 --> 06:00.560
But we have no way to regulate it
or to calculate the distance we travelled

06:00.680 --> 06:02.880
because of naquadria's instability.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.080
We could end up anywhere.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.240
lf he was gonna help out,
he'd have shown by now.

06:14.320 --> 06:17.520
- Who?
- Thor.

06:18.080 --> 06:21.120
- Little guy, grey.
- l know who Thor is.

06:21.200 --> 06:25.200
The Asgard have proven valuable
in similar situations.

06:25.320 --> 06:28.240
- Carter?
- l'm afraid it doesn't look good, sir.

06:28.360 --> 06:32.320
Even if we could write a subroutine
into the computer to bypass the buffer,

06:32.400 --> 06:35.120
we'd still risk the reactor going critical.

06:35.240 --> 06:40.000
Use whatever you need to repair
the buffer. Cannibalise any other systems.

06:40.120 --> 06:42.400
With all due respect, Colonel, l can't.

06:44.080 --> 06:48.000
- Carter?
- Sir, l helped design the buffer module.

06:48.120 --> 06:53.600
There is no way l can make it operational,
not with what we have on this ship.

06:54.120 --> 06:58.160
lt's like a light bulb that's burned out -
you can't just fix it.

06:59.600 --> 07:04.000
- Do we have any extra bulbs?
- There's no redundancy for that system.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.720
So you're saying there's no redundancy?

07:06.840 --> 07:11.960
Even if we plotted a course for Earth using
maximum sublight thrust, it'd take years.

07:12.040 --> 07:16.080
- We don't have the supplies.
- Not to mention the relativistic effects.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.720
That buffer has to be repaired.

07:18.840 --> 07:22.000
Actually, there may be another solution.

07:22.560 --> 07:29.040
According to the cartouche, there's a
planet .38 light years from here - P3X-7 44.

07:29.120 --> 07:34.240
We've dialled it unsuccessfully before, but
if it's on the cartouche it must have a gate.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.920
Perhaps it's buried.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.880
lf we get there, we can get
what we need to fix the ship.

07:38.960 --> 07:42.800
lt's a four-month journey using
sublight engines. We'd never make it.

07:42.920 --> 07:46.560
- We use the hyperdrive.
- l thought we couldn't do that.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.840
For a protracted period of time, no.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.800
7 44 would be a pretty short hop.

07:54.200 --> 07:57.520
The shorter the energy burst,
the less chance of instability.

07:57.640 --> 07:59.600
That's what l'm thinking.

07:59.720 --> 08:02.280
lt's your call.

08:03.120 --> 08:06.560
But l don't see how we have much choice.

08:07.600 --> 08:11.200
Major Gant, plot a course for 7 44.

08:20.880 --> 08:24.480
Now orbiting P3X-7 44, sir.

08:24.560 --> 08:28.160
- Any port in a storm, eh?
- Good work, people.

08:29.840 --> 08:33.200
Sir, there's an energy build-up
in the naquadria cells.

08:33.320 --> 08:38.960
- Shut down power to the reactor.
- The controls will not respond, sir.

08:39.039 --> 08:43.280
The jump must have triggered a surge
that overloaded the control systems.

08:43.400 --> 08:46.400
Sir, without the buffer
we can't stop the build-up.

08:46.520 --> 08:50.120
We have a few minutes
before the naquadria reactor goes critical.

08:50.240 --> 08:54.520
- Stand by to jettison the reactor module.
- Yes, sir.

08:54.640 --> 08:58.920
lf there's no gate on this planet,
we lose our only means of getting home.

08:59.000 --> 09:04.160
- lt would appear there is little choice.
- Get shields and sublight engines on line.

09:04.280 --> 09:06.720
We won't get very far away
before it blows.

09:06.800 --> 09:10.200
Then we're about to find out
just how good our shields are.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.760
- All hands, brace for impact.
- (alarm)

09:12.880 --> 09:17.800
Reactor-module separation on my mark.
Three, two, one, mark.

09:25.040 --> 09:28.720
- Module jettisoned.
- Get us clear. Full military thrust.

09:41.880 --> 09:43.040
(alarm)

09:58.040 --> 10:01.040
- Damage report.
- An electromagnetic pulse hit the shields.

10:01.160 --> 10:05.040
Primary computers down. All we have
is artificial gravity and life support.

10:05.160 --> 10:08.560
- Casualties?
- None reported.

10:08.680 --> 10:12.400
- How soon till systems are back on line?
- lt's too early to say.

10:12.520 --> 10:15.120
- l'd like to assist if l may.
- Please do, Major.

10:15.240 --> 10:21.320
Colonel, picking up incoming bogies from
the planet's surface heading this way.

10:21.440 --> 10:26.480
- (Ronson) Can you identify them?
- A long-range ballistic weapon, sir.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.800
We're under attack.

10:39.800 --> 10:43.200
- Missiles are on an intercept course.
- (Ronson) Leave orbit.

10:43.320 --> 10:47.760
- We can't manoeuvre, sir.
- Arm weapons. We'll try to take them out.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.480
Weapons control is down, sir.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.520
- How long before they hit?
- Three minutes.

10:53.640 --> 10:56.240
Not enough time
to get systems back on line.

10:56.320 --> 10:59.920
They only launched missiles
after we exploded our hyperdrive.

11:00.040 --> 11:03.280
lt could have looked like an attack
from their point of view.

11:03.400 --> 11:08.400
l agree, sir. Based on the weapons
they fired, they're a sophisticated race.

11:08.480 --> 11:13.320
The EM pulse that hit our computers may
have had the same impact on their planet.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.880
Then how could they launch missiles?

11:16.000 --> 11:20.080
Ballistic missile sites on Earth
are shielded for EMP.

11:20.920 --> 11:24.000
- Let's talk to 'em.
- Two minutes to missile impact.

11:24.120 --> 11:28.240
l can broadcast on multiple frequencies.
They could pick it up.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.400
Do it.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.360
This is Colonel O'Neill
of the US Air Force vessel Prometheus.

11:35.440 --> 11:38.720
- Can anyone hear me down there?
- (static)

11:39.760 --> 11:43.920
The explosion that just happened
over your planet was an accident.

11:44.040 --> 11:49.040
The resulting EM pulse damaged our ship.
We are defenceless against your attack.

11:49.160 --> 11:50.800
(static)

11:53.160 --> 11:55.920
We've come a long way to meet you folks,

11:56.000 --> 12:00.960
so if there's anything you could do to,
you know, stop those missiles...

12:02.520 --> 12:06.400
- One minute to impact.
- Lock down compartments and brace.

12:06.480 --> 12:07.840
(alarm)

12:07.920 --> 12:13.040
We'd very much like the opportunity
to land and introduce ourselves,

12:13.120 --> 12:19.600
but if you destroy our ship,
that's going to be... very difficult.

12:19.680 --> 12:22.040
(static)

12:47.920 --> 12:50.560
Missiles self-destructed at 1 7,000 metres.

12:54.560 --> 12:57.680
This is Commander Kalfas
of the Tagrean security force.

12:57.800 --> 13:01.560
We will transmit landing coordinates.
Kalfas out.

13:01.680 --> 13:05.360
Not exactly an engraved invitation, but...

13:06.400 --> 13:11.200
l would prefer not landing until we have
our shields and weapons back on line.

13:11.280 --> 13:15.920
We should have systems back up
within a few minutes, sir.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.440
The guy you talked to is
Commander Kalfas. The planet is Tagrea.

13:33.520 --> 13:36.080
Kalfas. Tagrea. Got it.

13:36.160 --> 13:41.600
Sir, l've scanned for naqahdah traces
to determine the location of the Stargate.

13:41.680 --> 13:43.680
So far l've got nothing.

13:43.760 --> 13:47.040
- Could the cartouche be incorrect?
- lt hasn't been yet.

13:47.120 --> 13:52.960
lf they don't accept our apology, finding
the gate'll be the least of our problems.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.400
Drop your weapons immediately.

14:25.200 --> 14:29.280
Howdy, fellas.
Colonel Jack O'Neill, United States...

14:29.360 --> 14:32.320
Powerful weapons
are aimed at you and your ship.

14:32.400 --> 14:36.960
- Air Force.
- Disarm yourselves, or you'll be fired on.

14:37.040 --> 14:42.040
- This is not negotiable.
- l believe he is being sincere in his threat.

14:42.160 --> 14:45.920
l guess we have to start
trusting them at some point.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.680
Yeah.

15:01.160 --> 15:05.200
l take it we've you to thank for destroying
the missiles before they hit,

15:05.320 --> 15:07.880
thus saving our lives?

15:07.960 --> 15:11.520
There was something in your voice
that l trusted.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.000
Did l mention we're sorry?

15:16.080 --> 15:20.800
Knowing the EM pulse damaged your
ship l'll accept it was unintentional.

15:20.920 --> 15:25.200
- l'm not so willing.
- Power has been restored to the cities.

15:25.320 --> 15:28.080
There was much impact
on our economic systems.

15:28.160 --> 15:31.840
- They will recover.
- We don't know the extent of the damage.

15:31.960 --> 15:33.920
Nothing...

15:34.000 --> 15:39.600
compared to the event of meeting people
from another world for the very first time.

15:41.880 --> 15:44.440
lt is a profound moment for us.

15:45.480 --> 15:49.600
You have said Tagrea holds the key
to returning to your home planet.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.480
- Could you be more specific?
- Chairman Ashwan...

15:52.600 --> 15:58.840
we believe you have alien technology that
can transport matter across the galaxy.

16:04.480 --> 16:07.360
We'd like to borrow your Stargate.

16:07.920 --> 16:14.000
- l'm sorry, our ''Stargate''?
- A ring thing? Comes with a dialler.

16:14.080 --> 16:20.640
You hit the symbols, it spins around,
lights come on and it flushes sideways.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.720
lt looks like...

16:25.240 --> 16:27.280
this.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.080
Once activated,

16:30.160 --> 16:34.160
it is able to transport you from
one planet to another instantaneously.

16:34.280 --> 16:37.120
ln this case,
from Tagrea to our planet, Earth.

16:37.240 --> 16:40.320
They seek the Ring of the Gods.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.920
lf that's what you wanna call it.
''Ring of the Gods'' is good.

16:46.120 --> 16:51.280
Please, understand.
This device you seek - the ''Stargate''.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.240
- l regret to tell you...
- lt's a myth.

16:54.360 --> 16:58.480
There has never been a shred of evidence
to prove its existence.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.880
Have you looked around? Just...

17:02.960 --> 17:07.319
lf you grant us access to historical data,
we might be able to shed light on this.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.680
Your freedom of movement
is not negotiable.

17:09.800 --> 17:14.319
Once this meeting is over, you are
to return to your vessel and stay there.

17:14.440 --> 17:18.000
ln the meantime, l will have
some historical data delivered to you.

17:18.119 --> 17:23.440
- Mr Chairman
- lf you prove the existence of a Stargate,

17:24.160 --> 17:30.200
we will be glad to help you locate it as an
act of good faith between our two worlds.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.440
Thank you, Ashwan.

17:42.080 --> 17:45.440
They may well be gathering
information for an invasion.

17:45.560 --> 17:50.000
Even if you're right,
knowing our history will do no harm.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.320
But, Kalfas...

17:52.440 --> 17:55.520
what if this ring does exist?

17:56.400 --> 18:01.440
lmagine, after all these centuries,
finding a piece of our past.

18:03.200 --> 18:07.760
And what if our past
was buried for a good reason?

18:07.840 --> 18:12.240
Travellers from another world
are seeking our help.

18:21.280 --> 18:22.880
How goes the homework?

18:22.960 --> 18:26.440
There's almost nothing
to indicate how these people got here.

18:26.520 --> 18:31.680
No archaeological data, no ancient
writings, no documentation of artefacts.

18:31.760 --> 18:36.400
l have found no mention of the Chaapa-ai,
nor other technology used by the Goa'uld.

18:36.480 --> 18:40.640
That's a little weird.
The Goa'uld are damn litterbugs.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.120
They usually leave a lot of crap behind.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.440
That is most often the case.

18:45.520 --> 18:48.240
lf this is a comprehensive history,
it's a joke.

18:48.360 --> 18:51.840
l know. There's nothing
dating back further than 300 years.

18:51.960 --> 18:56.320
- Maybe a year is longer on this planet.
- Maybe, sir, but even so,

18:56.440 --> 19:00.320
with no idea of where the Tagreans
came from, we can't find the Stargate.

19:00.440 --> 19:04.920
So, either they are
hiding something from us, or...

19:05.040 --> 19:08.480
Or their entire past has been erased.

19:18.400 --> 19:21.920
- You invited them for dinner
- l was thinking more of a brunch.

19:22.040 --> 19:25.320
We offered it in exchange
for access to their archives.

19:25.400 --> 19:30.240
- A library pass for a tour of the ship.
- When were you going to inform me?

19:31.880 --> 19:36.000
- Now.
- l can appreciate you wanna get home,

19:36.080 --> 19:39.080
but my priority is the security
of this ship and crew.

19:39.160 --> 19:44.000
Ronson, your ship and crew are going
nowhere unless we find that gate.

19:44.120 --> 19:47.800
l just don't like the idea
of giving a guided tour of Prometheus

19:47.920 --> 19:50.800
to the same people
with gun batteries aimed at us.

19:50.880 --> 19:53.440
We'd do the same damn thing.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.440
Colonel Ronson,
we need these people to get home,

19:56.520 --> 19:59.920
and we didn't exactly make
a good first impression.

20:01.480 --> 20:06.240
We'll do this little barbecue of yours,
but that's as far as l go.

20:12.240 --> 20:15.360
Do we have a barbecue?

20:24.840 --> 20:28.480
- How many planets has SG-1 been to?
- 133.

20:28.600 --> 20:31.320
On each of them,
those inhabited by humans at least,

20:31.400 --> 20:35.200
there's been some indication
of their origins - a temple, ruins.

20:35.320 --> 20:37.520
lt is indeed a mystery, Jonas Quinn.

20:37.600 --> 20:42.400
A Goa'uld would not bring Tauri to a world
and not force them to build monuments.

20:42.480 --> 20:47.200
l don't care how hard you try, you can't
erase history. Something has to remain.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.920
We just need to find it.

20:52.120 --> 20:57.680
- We are being watched.
- The guy half-hiding behind the shelf?

20:57.800 --> 21:00.880
He's been casing us since we got here.

21:05.920 --> 21:07.760
And not very well either.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.720
Most impressive.

21:10.840 --> 21:17.440
And you say much of the technology
included in your vessel is of alien origin?

21:17.520 --> 21:21.280
- Yes.
- Most of the key systems, in fact.

21:21.360 --> 21:25.040
lt's one thing to build a ship,
another to fly it across the galaxy.

21:25.120 --> 21:27.760
We haven't got that part
straightened out yet.

21:27.880 --> 21:33.440
We use the element naquadria to power
our hyperdrive engines, but it is unstable.

21:33.520 --> 21:37.360
ln fact, that instability
led to the explosion above your planet.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.440
We had to eject the reactor.

21:39.560 --> 21:42.640
Why use such a dangerous substance
to power your ship?

21:42.720 --> 21:45.920
l've asked the same question.

21:46.000 --> 21:49.280
For now, naquadria is our short cut
to interstellar travel.

21:49.360 --> 21:54.240
More stable forms of energy don't provide
enough power to run the hyperdrive.

21:54.360 --> 22:00.160
My advisors have expressed concern this
is a military ship. What do l say to them?

22:00.240 --> 22:02.640
That they're right.

22:02.760 --> 22:05.600
Prometheus was designed
for defensive purposes.

22:05.720 --> 22:07.520
- From these ''Goa'uld''?
- Yes.

22:07.600 --> 22:12.240
- Without your main source of power?
- With or without the naquadria reactor,

22:12.320 --> 22:17.120
this ship is more than capable
of defending itself against attack.

22:17.200 --> 22:21.680
May l introduce Colonel William Ronson,
commander of the Prometheus.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.440
lt is an honour.

22:23.560 --> 22:26.960
l assure you we would not attack
without provocation.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.160
There are several gun batteries
aimed at my ship, sir.

22:30.280 --> 22:33.520
We must defend ourselves
from any action you might take.

22:33.640 --> 22:38.240
For instance, should Chairman Ashwan
and l fail to appear at a specific time,

22:38.320 --> 22:41.680
my men have orders
to fire those batteries.

22:41.800 --> 22:45.280
Then perhaps we had better
continue the tour.

22:47.120 --> 22:50.400
- Please, Major Carter, after you.
- Thank you, sir.

22:50.520 --> 22:52.400
Sir.

23:14.920 --> 23:20.240
- May we be of assistance?
- Forgive me. l did not want to intrude.

23:20.320 --> 23:25.440
l am Tarek Solamon. l am a professor
of mathematics at the university.

23:25.560 --> 23:29.760
l'm Jonas Quinn. This is Teal'c. lf you
were curious about us, just come over.

23:29.880 --> 23:35.760
With respect, Mr Quinn, it is not you
l was curious about, but what you seek.

23:35.880 --> 23:36.880
Continue.

23:37.000 --> 23:42.480
l've heard you seek evidence of the Ring
of the Gods. l believe l can help you find it.

23:55.200 --> 24:00.800
l hope it's satisfactory. We didn't expect
to host a formal dinner on this mission.

24:00.920 --> 24:04.960
lt's fascinating to realise
we are eating food

24:05.040 --> 24:08.640
grown and prepared on a world
millions of light years away.

24:08.720 --> 24:12.560
And frozen millions of years ago.

24:14.280 --> 24:17.280
lt's the best we have on board.

24:18.760 --> 24:21.520
Mr Chairman, we noticed in our research

24:21.640 --> 24:25.760
that your history seems limited
to the last 300 years.

24:27.040 --> 24:29.840
Prior to our recorded history,

24:29.920 --> 24:32.320
our people endured a...

24:32.440 --> 24:35.840
a long and terrible dark age.

24:37.040 --> 24:39.760
One they desperately wish to forget.

24:40.520 --> 24:44.160
Thus, only after Tagrea
emerged from this black era

24:44.280 --> 24:48.000
did historians begin again
to record events.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.720
lt means you're missing
many years of your past.

24:50.800 --> 24:52.640
Yes.

24:53.560 --> 24:56.400
Aren't you curious?

24:57.120 --> 24:59.280
lt's hardly a question of choice.

24:59.400 --> 25:02.480
Even if we wished to know our history,
there's none to study.

25:02.600 --> 25:06.240
All evidence of it was destroyed
centuries ago.

25:06.360 --> 25:10.880
We believe what came before Year Zero
has no intrinsic value to our society.

25:10.960 --> 25:15.280
The society of the new era
has no need to know how they suffered.

25:15.360 --> 25:20.240
On Earth we study our past
to learn from it.

25:20.360 --> 25:24.880
Whereas we believe
that nostalgia's a sign of weakness.

25:30.040 --> 25:32.800
l'm sure both points of view have merit.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.120
Well said, Major.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.280
A drink to history.

25:46.040 --> 25:48.640
And to the future.

26:01.200 --> 26:06.240
Colonel O'Neill, Major Carter,
the meal was... interesting.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.400
Glad you liked it.

26:08.520 --> 26:12.200
- He didn't say that.
- Well, l did. Thank you.

26:13.360 --> 26:16.720
Now that we've gotten
to know each other a little better,

26:16.800 --> 26:21.120
do you think having those guns
pointed at us is completely necessary?

26:21.200 --> 26:24.160
Would your Colonel Ronson
not be as vigilant?

26:26.240 --> 26:28.960
Yes, l'm sure he would be.

26:31.000 --> 26:34.640
- Mr Chairman?
- Go, Kalfas. l will join you in a moment.

26:43.200 --> 26:47.760
l apologise for Commander Kalfas'
behaviour. Diplomacy is not his strength.

26:47.840 --> 26:50.960
Yes. We share that quality in common.

26:51.080 --> 26:58.000
Since l took office, l have been perceived
as being weak in matters of civic defence.

26:58.120 --> 27:01.600
As a result, Kalfas has
growing political support.

27:01.680 --> 27:05.200
Our arrival hasn't
helped things much, has it?

27:05.320 --> 27:07.680
No.

27:07.800 --> 27:12.320
l only hope his mistrust does not interfere
with your quest for the Stargate.

27:12.440 --> 27:18.000
l believe finding it would be
a great discovery for our people.

27:20.040 --> 27:23.280
(Tarek) Please excuse
the state of my office.

27:25.160 --> 27:30.480
So you said you could help us
find the Ring of the Gods.

27:30.600 --> 27:33.440
- How?
- With these.

27:33.520 --> 27:36.400
l spent a lifetime collecting them.

27:36.520 --> 27:40.640
Relics from before my people
turned their back on their god.

27:40.760 --> 27:44.800
- To which god are you referring?
- Our creator. Horus.

27:44.880 --> 27:48.400
Only a few of us dare believe in him.

27:50.000 --> 27:53.200
- lt is the symbol of Heru-ur.
- You know him?

27:53.280 --> 27:57.280
Heru-ur is not a god. He is a Goa'uld.

27:58.040 --> 28:01.920
He is the one who made us. The relics
speak of him as the creator of all life.

28:02.040 --> 28:04.160
The one who spoke us into existence.

28:04.240 --> 28:08.480
More likely he enslaved your ancestors
and brought them here from Earth.

28:08.560 --> 28:13.760
Heru-ur must have abandoned your
people when resources were depleted.

28:13.880 --> 28:18.080
Then the Tagreans must have tried
to destroy all evidence of their former god,

28:18.200 --> 28:20.760
including everything
to do with the Stargate.

28:20.840 --> 28:23.840
They did not destroy everything.

28:25.280 --> 28:27.360
This remains.

28:48.200 --> 28:50.960
My understanding
of this language is limited,

28:51.080 --> 28:55.280
but it appears to be an etching
of something called a ''shap eye''.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.520
- Chaapa-ai.
- Ah.

28:57.640 --> 29:04.480
This text is a slight variation
of predynastic Egyptian. lt's beautiful.

29:04.600 --> 29:11.440
This section here says Heru-ur's Stargate
can be found in a great desert to the north.

29:12.240 --> 29:16.240
lt must mean the wastelands of Anhur.
They lie far beyond the city.

29:16.320 --> 29:19.680
- l have found many of my artefacts there.
- Really?

29:23.200 --> 29:27.120
Guys? We'd like to take a little field trip.

29:28.800 --> 29:31.920
- They want to go to the wastelands.
- Then take them.

29:32.040 --> 29:34.720
l think that's a mistake.

29:34.800 --> 29:38.480
Because they may find something
you do not wish them to find?

29:38.600 --> 29:42.280
- lf this is some sort of reconnaissance...
- You're being ridiculous.

29:42.400 --> 29:47.760
- And you are being reckless
- People from another world are here.

29:47.880 --> 29:49.920
Do you understand?

29:50.040 --> 29:54.640
- And what's more, they seek our help.
- We do not know their true intentions.

29:54.760 --> 29:58.080
Or what they can offer us -
an exchange of knowledge.

29:58.160 --> 30:00.640
The Stargate
could open up the universe to us.

30:00.760 --> 30:04.640
A universe of potential enemies.
l demand you reconsider.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.680
We cannot undo what has happened.

30:09.080 --> 30:13.440
The difference is, Kalfas,
l would not if l could.

30:14.640 --> 30:19.640
They are here, and we must
deal with them one way or another.

30:19.760 --> 30:21.760
- l prefer to help.
- And l prefer...

30:21.840 --> 30:25.360
Now have them taken to the coordinates.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.040
As you wish.

30:33.840 --> 30:38.000
The Stargate should be located
directly in the middle of the second...

30:38.080 --> 30:40.560
and third monument.

30:40.680 --> 30:42.880
Are you certain, Jonas Quinn?

30:43.000 --> 30:45.760
Well, that's what it says.

30:53.600 --> 30:55.600
Jonas.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.360
(clanging)

30:58.400 --> 31:01.360
- You think that's the cover stones?
- lndeed.

31:22.240 --> 31:25.520
''Here lies the Chaapa-ai of Heru-ur...

31:27.080 --> 31:30.800
false god to the people of Tagrea.''

31:32.720 --> 31:36.080
''May it never know the daylight again.''

31:36.160 --> 31:38.240
The ring exists.

31:40.160 --> 31:43.680
- (Teal'c) O'Neill.
- What's up, T?

31:43.760 --> 31:46.080
l believe we have located the Stargate.

31:49.040 --> 31:53.200
- That's good news.
- We will require assistance to retrieve it.

31:53.280 --> 31:55.840
l'll talk to Ashwan.

31:56.720 --> 31:58.720
Nice job.

32:29.600 --> 32:30.800
(Carter) Jonas

32:30.920 --> 32:33.920
lt looks good. lt looks intact.

33:26.760 --> 33:29.360
Well, let's give it a shot.

33:55.080 --> 33:56.560
Kalfas.

33:57.680 --> 34:02.080
- What are you doing?
- Taking back what belongs to my people.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.360
Kalfas' actions are outrageous.

34:14.440 --> 34:17.520
- Tell him to stand down.
- l've done that. He refuses.

34:17.639 --> 34:22.480
- He claims to be protecting our security.
- Have him arrested.

34:22.560 --> 34:25.280
Kalfas commands great loyalty
in the military.

34:25.400 --> 34:28.000
Challenging him
would only lead to civil war.

34:28.080 --> 34:33.360
Sir, we could use the Prometheus.
Her weapons would defeat Kalfas' troops.

34:33.480 --> 34:37.840
There is still that nagging problem
of all the guns pointed at it.

34:37.920 --> 34:43.280
l chose the commander of those
gun batteries myself. He is loyal to me.

34:43.400 --> 34:47.159
Colonel, l give you my word
he will not fire upon your ship.

34:56.360 --> 35:00.120
Kalfas, you've no idea
what you're dealing with.

35:00.200 --> 35:03.120
l know our ancestors
buried this device for a reason.

35:03.200 --> 35:07.280
Maybe they were wrong. Maybe
you should stop being afraid of the past.

35:07.400 --> 35:10.240
lt's not the past that concerns me.
lt's the future.

35:10.360 --> 35:14.480
Having assessed our strength,
you would return with greater numbers.

35:14.600 --> 35:18.080
- You have nothing to fear.
- (Quinn) We just wanna fix our ship.

35:18.160 --> 35:23.080
Our people can become friends, they can
exchange knowledge, even trade.

35:23.200 --> 35:26.400
We'll even teach you
how to use the Stargate.

35:29.080 --> 35:32.360
Yes. You will teach me how to use it.

35:36.880 --> 35:40.800
They're holding two of my men prisoner.
We need the ship.

35:40.880 --> 35:45.120
Our shields are down. lf we take off
and they open fire with those guns...

35:45.240 --> 35:47.800
Ashwan promised they wouldn't.

35:47.880 --> 35:53.200
He lost control of his government, and l'm
to trust the safety of my crew to his word?

35:53.320 --> 35:55.760
Yes. That's what you're going to do.

35:55.840 --> 35:59.880
Jack, you're asking me
to risk everyone on this ship.

36:00.000 --> 36:05.120
lf that is so, Colonel Ronson,
then l will be taking the same risk.

36:05.240 --> 36:09.760
You may launch your vessel when ready.
You will not be fired upon.

36:12.480 --> 36:14.320
- Major Gant.
- Sir?

36:14.400 --> 36:17.440
Fire up the sublight engines.

36:17.520 --> 36:23.440
Arm all available weapons and
prepare to return fire... on my orders only.

36:23.560 --> 36:26.640
That will not be necessary, Colonel.

36:33.520 --> 36:38.800
Let's hope the old man is right,
or this is gonna be a short ride.

36:51.840 --> 36:56.640
No sign of weapon fire from
the gun batteries, sir. l think we're clear.

37:02.720 --> 37:07.040
Very well. Proceed to the coordinates
at one-third thrust.

37:07.160 --> 37:08.960
Yes, sir.

37:25.640 --> 37:28.800
Are you sure you're up to this?
Things can get out of hand.

37:28.880 --> 37:32.240
l'm not afraid, Major.
l should have done this a long time ago.

37:32.360 --> 37:34.960
This is Ronson. We're in position.

37:35.080 --> 37:37.120
Roger that.

37:55.040 --> 37:58.960
Prometheus,
hold your fire until my signal.

37:59.040 --> 38:01.280
(Ronson) ''Prometheus'' has your six.

38:11.720 --> 38:14.320
This has gone far enough.
Release these men.

38:14.400 --> 38:19.600
Hold your positions. We cannot let him
hand this device over to the aliens.

38:24.920 --> 38:26.960
Commander Kalfas.

38:28.280 --> 38:31.760
He's a good man, a cautious man.

38:32.880 --> 38:35.120
But he thinks, as our ancestors did,

38:35.200 --> 38:38.360
that it is better to control
what we do not understand,

38:38.480 --> 38:41.520
to bury it so it cannot harm us.

38:41.640 --> 38:44.960
l, too, once thought as he does,
but no longer.

38:47.440 --> 38:51.360
These... ''aliens''
who Kalfas fears so much...

38:52.640 --> 38:55.600
are not conquerors.

38:55.680 --> 38:57.880
They are long-lost brethren.

39:02.200 --> 39:04.800
Look at it.

39:04.920 --> 39:07.920
This is where we came from.

39:10.680 --> 39:13.360
This is who we are.

39:13.440 --> 39:17.280
Our ancestors
erased our history out of fear.

39:19.040 --> 39:22.480
And yet, without our history...

39:22.560 --> 39:25.920
we cannot know who we are...

39:26.040 --> 39:28.880
or what we may some day become.

39:30.040 --> 39:33.040
l will not make that same mistake.

39:38.040 --> 39:40.600
l'm relieving you of your command.

39:40.680 --> 39:43.360
You and your men will stand down.

39:48.880 --> 39:51.760
l said lower your weapons

40:04.640 --> 40:06.640
Take him away.

40:20.120 --> 40:22.160
Didn't know you had that in you.

40:22.280 --> 40:24.320
Neither did l.

40:28.520 --> 40:32.000
We'll be back in a few days
with equipment to repair our ship.

40:32.120 --> 40:35.280
Until then Colonel Ronson
and his crew will be our guests.

40:35.400 --> 40:39.080
l hope you'll join us
at a state dinner upon your return.

40:42.480 --> 40:44.840
- Thanks, Tarek.
- No. Thank you.

40:44.960 --> 40:48.800
l hope you will soon return.
There is much to learn about our history.

40:48.880 --> 40:52.960
Yeah, but l think you know more
than most people on your planet.

40:53.080 --> 40:57.640
l have a feeling this guy's
gonna be getting a bigger office soon.
