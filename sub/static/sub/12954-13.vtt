WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.229
Previously on "Alias":

00:02.302 --> 00:05.203
I'm offering you the chance
to destroy Sydney Bristow.

00:05.271 --> 00:09.139
The moment this assignment is over,
we'll give you back your daughter.

00:09.209 --> 00:11.609
Sydney Bristow was not to be harmed.

00:11.678 --> 00:16.012
You locked her in a train car, and
you sprayed her with a chemical agent.

00:16.082 --> 00:19.950
It's all there.
Everything you need to bring Nadia back.

00:20.020 --> 00:23.319
I loaded the Bristow DNA template
into the sequencer.

00:23.390 --> 00:26.052
The genetic fluid is primed and ready.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

00:41.775 --> 00:46.405
(Southern US accent) That's not good
enough. Am I a dog whistle? I said no. N-o.

00:46.479 --> 00:49.744
That's right. That's better.
Thank you.

00:50.450 --> 00:52.748
- You Mr. Halbe?
- It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:52.819 --> 00:55.515
- I hope your trip wasn't too arduous.
- My trip was fine.

00:55.588 --> 01:00.321
It's these marketing people. BAs, MBAs.
Not a lick of common sense among 'em.

01:00.393 --> 01:03.328
They almost didn't launch
my new perfume, L'Eau de Passion.

01:03.396 --> 01:07.093
- They thought the name was tacky.
- It's... a lovely name.

01:07.167 --> 01:11.365
I know. That's why I always trust my
instincts. And now it's flying off the shelves.

01:11.438 --> 01:14.703
I assure you, we can take care
of all your customer-service needs.

01:14.774 --> 01:18.232
I don't want people suffering ten minutes
of panflute waiting to order.

01:18.311 --> 01:21.144
Of course not.
Let me show you our main call center.

01:23.783 --> 01:26.946
Wow!
I think I came to the right place.

01:28.288 --> 01:31.621
We got a lead on Anna. She's routing
her calls to a call center in Jaipur

01:31.691 --> 01:36.219
using an encrypted router. She must have
spliced one of these onto an outside line.

01:36.296 --> 01:39.788
They have no idea she's piggybacking
onto their system. She's anonymous.

01:39.866 --> 01:42.232
We locate the router,
remove the encryption key.

01:42.302 --> 01:44.293
Next time Anna makes a call,
we listen in.

01:44.370 --> 01:46.861
- Maybe trace her location.
- What's the approach?

01:46.940 --> 01:51.172
All you need to do is get
this perfume bottle within five feet of...

01:51.244 --> 01:54.577
a Wi-Fi access point, and then
you can just map the phone system.

01:54.647 --> 01:58.174
- We can figure out which line she's using.
- L'Eau de Passion?

01:58.251 --> 02:02.881
- What, you think it's... too tacky?
- I'll work with it.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.220
Soon we'll double our call-volume capacity.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.259
You'll need to triple it
when you start getting calls about this.

02:08.328 --> 02:11.320
Stripe is on back order
but the heather sprig is available.

02:11.397 --> 02:13.991
Excuse me, ma'am.
How do you like this smell?

02:15.135 --> 02:17.126
It's called L'Eau de Passion.

02:17.203 --> 02:19.694
Nice. Well, you keep it.

02:21.508 --> 02:23.874
Sorry, my computer's working slow today.

02:25.111 --> 02:26.806
(beeping)

02:26.880 --> 02:29.348
Signal's good.
I'm mapping the system now.

02:29.415 --> 02:33.317
If you outsource, you can cut your
customer-service budget by at least 30%.

02:33.386 --> 02:36.082
- lnteresting.
- Syd, we've got a problem.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.421
The router is not out here,
it's in the building.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.290
Could I come back tomorrow?
I need to think about it.

02:42.362 --> 02:45.195
No, don't go.
Just follow my lead.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.471
Nobody move!

02:52.539 --> 02:54.404
Drop it!

02:59.979 --> 03:04.473
You get on the ground.
You in the pink, come here.

03:04.551 --> 03:06.542
Get down!

03:12.058 --> 03:14.117
Get on the ground!

03:18.631 --> 03:21.794
Watches, jewelry, wallets - in the bag!

03:22.468 --> 03:24.834
Hurry up!

03:24.904 --> 03:28.271
- (Anna) No reason not to be nice!
- Come on!

03:34.214 --> 03:36.910
All right, now,that'senoughfortoday.

03:36.983 --> 03:38.951
Get up.

03:40.386 --> 03:44.880
If anyone does anything
in the next three minutes, she dies.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.621
Let me see this.

03:50.663 --> 03:53.223
- Hey, I saw a watch I liked.
- It's probably a knockoff.

03:55.868 --> 03:57.859
- Renee, what you did...
- You don't approve.

03:57.937 --> 04:00.872
No, it was brilliant.
You should think about joining APO.

04:00.940 --> 04:05.309
- In case you forgot, I'm a criminal.
- We could try for a pardon. Think about it.

04:05.712 --> 04:07.179
OK.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.238
No.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.499
I was surprised to hear from you.

04:31.571 --> 04:33.937
You made it clear
your dealings with us were over.

04:34.007 --> 04:39.445
I read the instructions. For the serum to
work, Nadia's heart needs to be stopped.

04:40.913 --> 04:44.007
Hm. Only briefly, as I recall.
30 seconds or so.

04:44.083 --> 04:46.278
You're asking me to kill my daughter.

04:46.352 --> 04:50.652
I'm asking you
to have faith in Rambaldi.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.819
Rambaldi designed the cure?

04:52.892 --> 04:58.194
Well, given that Nadia's illness stems from
his invention, doesn't that make sense?

04:58.998 --> 05:02.559
Surely I don't have to convince you
of the genius behind his designs.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.103
You spent decades pursuing his works.

05:05.171 --> 05:09.267
If things had gone differently,
you'd be working with us right now.

05:09.342 --> 05:13.540
You'd be there... when we realized
his greatest achievement.

05:13.613 --> 05:15.604
You still could be.

05:16.482 --> 05:21.681
My pursuit of Rambaldi is over.
I won't allow it to consume me again.

05:23.222 --> 05:25.816
I'm only here for Nadia.

05:25.892 --> 05:28.292
That's unfortunate.

05:28.361 --> 05:33.264
But we upheld our end of the bargain.
We gave you the cure.

05:33.333 --> 05:38.168
Whether or not you choose
to administer it... It's up to you.

05:47.680 --> 05:52.879
Anna's line just went active. Marshall
and Rachel are standing by to intercept.

05:54.654 --> 05:57.714
- lnitiating the back-trace.
- Bringing the optical sats online.

05:57.790 --> 06:01.089
- (man) Allo?
- (woman) The weather report says rain.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.560
- That's Kelly Peyton.
- Pinpoint their locations.

06:03.629 --> 06:05.221
- On it.
- (French man) Who are you?

06:05.298 --> 06:09.325
(Peyton) That's not important.
Anna Espinosa works for me now.

06:09.402 --> 06:13.463
- (man) I don't do business with strangers.
- You've already been compensated.

06:13.539 --> 06:17.566
I got him. He's in Zurich,
47-22 north, 8-32 east.

06:17.643 --> 06:20.737
The cage. 1 2 feet is up.
I'm zooming in now.

06:22.615 --> 06:25.880
(man) I suppose. given your generosity.
I could make an exception.

06:25.952 --> 06:29.388
(Peyton) I figured. There's a bench
at the base of the stairs. Check under it.

06:29.455 --> 06:34.256
- We need Peyton's location.
- I know. She's routing into too many hubs.

06:36.429 --> 06:38.590
- Can you get a better view?
- Yeah.

06:39.098 --> 06:43.501
(man) I've got it in front of me.
What exactly do you want me to do?

06:43.569 --> 06:46.402
- (Peyton) A message is hidden in the text.
- Page 47.

06:46.472 --> 06:49.498
(man) What sort of message?
A code? A transfer? Microdot?

06:49.575 --> 06:52.100
(Peyton) If I knew that.
I wouldn't have to pay you.

06:52.178 --> 06:54.305
- Got it. She's in Barcelona.
- Where?

06:54.380 --> 06:57.144
I don't know. Give me a sec.
Keep talking, one more minute.

06:57.216 --> 06:59.878
(Peyton) Use the protocol
you had with Anna to contact me

06:59.952 --> 07:03.080
when you unveil the message
hidden on the page.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.421
Barcelona. That's all we have.

07:09.462 --> 07:12.590
I don't know, Anna.
He sounds a little skittish.

07:12.665 --> 07:16.032
He's the best.
If it exists, he'll find it.

07:18.838 --> 07:23.275
It doesn't make sense. If this guy was
Anna's contact, why is Peyton calling him?

07:23.342 --> 07:27.870
It's unclear. Now I want you and Marshall
to work together. See if you can lD him.

07:27.947 --> 07:31.383
If we can bring him into custody
we can use him to get to Anna.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.749
Reach out to all our contacts in Barcelona.

07:33.820 --> 07:37.950
If Prophet Five has established a new
outpost there, perhaps someone's heard.

07:38.024 --> 07:41.357
- What about the message?
- The one buried in 500-year-old paper?

07:41.427 --> 07:45.227
- Are we taking that seriously?
- We've seen too much not to.

07:45.298 --> 07:48.961
Look, we still have a copy of page 47.
I could take it and analyze it.

07:49.035 --> 07:51.265
I'm taking it with me.

07:51.337 --> 07:55.433
You have your assignments.
If anything develops, notify me at once.

07:55.508 --> 07:59.000
Wait. Where are you going?
Not that you have to tell me.

07:59.078 --> 08:01.603
- Unless you want to.
- I'm going to see Sloane.

08:01.681 --> 08:06.675
He had page 47 in his possession
long before it was turned over to the DSR.

08:06.752 --> 08:11.155
Given his obsession with it...
maybe he knows something we don't.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.358
(machine beeps continuously)

08:39.818 --> 08:42.652
I can't just let you lie there like this.

08:42.722 --> 08:45.520
Not if there's a way to get you back.

08:51.163 --> 08:53.154
I'm sorry.

09:08.948 --> 09:10.939
(machine powers down)

09:22.762 --> 09:24.753
(beeping speeds up)

09:28.134 --> 09:30.102
(beeping speeds up more)

09:37.476 --> 09:40.036
Oh, God, I'm sorry. It's the only way.

09:42.682 --> 09:44.673
(flatline beep)

09:45.451 --> 09:47.442
(Sloane sobs)

10:27.193 --> 10:29.184
(flatline beep)

10:44.877 --> 10:47.675
- I'd move away from her.
- You don't understand.

10:47.747 --> 10:52.081
Stop. This is not your decision to make,
no matter how much she's suffering.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.176
I have to do it now!

10:55.388 --> 10:56.787
(flatline beep)

10:56.856 --> 10:58.619
(sobs)

11:07.033 --> 11:09.729
Oh, my God. It's too late.

11:12.471 --> 11:15.065
It was a cure, Jack.

11:15.141 --> 11:17.541
Acure.

11:19.645 --> 11:21.579
(beeping restarts)

11:28.854 --> 11:31.652
It's OK. It's all right.

11:31.724 --> 11:33.419
(whispers emotionally)

11:33.492 --> 11:34.516
It's OK.

11:34.593 --> 11:38.393
It's OK, darling. You'll be all right.

11:38.464 --> 11:40.898
It's OK. It's all right.

11:43.969 --> 11:48.235
- (Dixon) She's working with Prophet Five?
- That explains how Anna escaped prison.

11:48.307 --> 11:50.172
But why? Why would they want her?

11:50.242 --> 11:51.675
- She's good.
- I know.

11:51.744 --> 11:54.235
But Prophet Five
has always been low profile.

11:54.313 --> 11:57.214
Anna is on everybody's radar.

11:57.283 --> 12:00.741
Maybe they had to go to her.
Maybe there's something only she can do.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.921
We've identified the man from Zurich.
Moritz Koller.

12:04.990 --> 12:09.256
He used to be an art historian. Supposedly
discovered da Vinci's lost drawings.

12:09.328 --> 12:11.523
- Supposedly?
- He forged them.

12:11.597 --> 12:15.465
- He was completely discredited.
- It looks like he went freelance.

12:15.534 --> 12:19.868
And plenty of criminal organizations
are happy to put his talent to good use.

12:19.939 --> 12:22.237
Including Le Corbeau.

12:22.308 --> 12:24.435
- He worked with Renee?
- More than once.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.603
It means she'll know how to find him.

12:26.679 --> 12:30.410
Syd, your father's on line two.
Nadia's awake.

12:38.657 --> 12:43.492
Looking at her like this...
I'm almost afraid to believe it's true.

12:44.196 --> 12:47.131
It must be an overwhelming relief.

12:47.199 --> 12:49.167
Yeah.

12:49.235 --> 12:52.033
I know you have questions, Jack.

12:52.705 --> 12:55.071
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I wanted to.

12:55.141 --> 12:58.406
But I was afraid for people to know.

12:58.477 --> 13:02.038
Conventional medicine gave up
on my daughter. I couldn't.

13:02.114 --> 13:05.413
I've been funding dozens
of back-channel research projects.

13:05.484 --> 13:10.478
Phase one studies using class A drugs.
Methods that no country would condone.

13:10.556 --> 13:13.821
And then one of them paid off.
A study out of Barcelona.

13:13.893 --> 13:18.091
- Barcelona?
- I had no guarantee that it would work.

13:18.164 --> 13:20.826
- My options had run out.
- (footsteps)

13:22.701 --> 13:24.066
- Sydney.
- Is she OK?

13:24.136 --> 13:26.832
She's with the doctor now.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.543
She's doing wonderfully.

13:36.148 --> 13:39.549
- You need me for anything, call the nurse.
- OK.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.084
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.789
Everything seems normal.
I need to run some tests.

13:51.864 --> 13:55.197
See if we can determine
how Nadia's condition reversed itself.

13:55.267 --> 13:58.498
No. My daughter has been poked
and prodded enough.

13:58.571 --> 14:02.701
If her health is no longer in jeopardy, I want
to make arrangements to take her home.

14:02.775 --> 14:06.336
- She deserves her life back.
- I understand.

14:06.412 --> 14:09.745
I'll update her file now
and see if we can get her out of here soon.

14:09.815 --> 14:11.874
Thank you.

14:13.319 --> 14:17.517
- Do you want to go in?
- In a minute. I've a call to return.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.581
(dials on cell phone)

14:21.794 --> 14:23.489
(man) Hello?

14:23.562 --> 14:26.554
It's me. I need you
to look into something, off the record.

14:26.632 --> 14:29.624
- Sure. What is it?
- Sloane's recent activities.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.899
That is, travel itineraries,
call logs, meeting reports.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.072
Anything you want me to focus on?

14:36.575 --> 14:38.406
Barcelona.

14:45.985 --> 14:49.148
- Did you find Koller?
- Tom's en route to meet Renee in Paris.

14:49.221 --> 14:52.452
But you called me away from Nadia.

14:52.524 --> 14:55.618
- How much do you know of Nadia's cure?
- Why?

14:55.694 --> 14:59.824
Sloane's travel records indicate
he's made several trips to Barcelona.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.197
He was there shortly before Peyton's call.

15:02.268 --> 15:06.068
Sloane told me he acquired the cure
in Barcelona, where Prophet Five is based.

15:06.138 --> 15:09.904
We know they've used Nadia's condition
to blackmail him in the past.

15:09.975 --> 15:13.502
Perhaps Sloane's association with them
didn't end there.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.343
You think he's working with them,
they gave him the cure?

15:16.415 --> 15:20.351
- Perhaps in exchange for information.
- Sloane's been breaking protocol,

15:20.419 --> 15:22.979
incorrectly logging calls
made from APO for months.

15:23.055 --> 15:26.218
Dozens of calls, all of them made
to numbers that no longer exist.

15:26.292 --> 15:31.093
He admits using illegal research channels.
Perhaps he's trying to cover it up.

15:31.163 --> 15:34.132
The back-channel research could be
a cover for something else.

15:34.199 --> 15:37.862
I know what Sloane is capable of.
You don't have to remind me.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.906
But Nadia has her life back
because of him.

15:40.973 --> 15:43.737
Which is why I hope I'm wrong about this.

15:43.809 --> 15:46.300
Do what you have to do.

15:46.378 --> 15:51.475
But until you have something concrete,
I will be with my sister.

16:04.163 --> 16:07.724
- You cold? Want me to get your blanket?
- No. The air feels good.

16:07.800 --> 16:08.789
OK.

16:08.867 --> 16:11.062
Sydney should be here soon.

16:12.271 --> 16:18.176
I can't wait to spend time with lsabelle. I'm
even looking forward to changing diapers.

16:18.243 --> 16:21.940
- So you're gonna stay at Sydney's?
- Yeah. I assume so.

16:25.217 --> 16:27.151
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.

16:28.954 --> 16:31.946
Ah, letmesee her!

16:32.358 --> 16:35.225
She's dying to meet her Aunt Nadia.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.299
- (gasps)
- Yeah, there!

16:42.668 --> 16:44.659
Hi, beautiful!

16:45.571 --> 16:46.799
Hi!

16:46.872 --> 16:51.536
Well, I'll leave the three of you
to enjoy each other's company.

16:51.610 --> 16:56.206
- Where are you going?
- APO. Jack wants to see me. I'll be back.

16:56.882 --> 16:59.282
We'll be fine. Won't we? Hm?

16:59.351 --> 17:01.546
OK. Enjoy the sun.

17:01.620 --> 17:04.111
(Nadia) What's happening? Hi!

17:05.023 --> 17:07.015
Yes! (cooing)

17:14.333 --> 17:16.631
You wanted to see me.

17:16.702 --> 17:20.398
I arranged for the leave of absence
you requested. The forms are here to sign.

17:20.472 --> 17:21.803
Thank you.

17:21.874 --> 17:25.241
Look, Jack, I realize the timing on this
is less than ideal but...

17:25.310 --> 17:27.642
You should be spending
this time with Nadia.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.841
Ah. Well, unfortunately,
I'm not sure she feels the same.

17:30.916 --> 17:33.407
- Give it time, Arvin.
- I know.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.251
You're right.

17:37.689 --> 17:40.988
One last thing.
We intercepted a call from Prophet Five.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.257
Turns out Anna gave them page 47.

17:44.329 --> 17:47.389
They're looking for a hidden message
encoded in the text.

17:47.466 --> 17:49.764
Were you aware of this?

17:51.270 --> 17:52.259
No.

17:52.337 --> 17:56.706
Apparently, the message is hidden
in a substitution cipher.

17:56.775 --> 18:01.371
Marshall believes he's close to decoding it.
I could let you know when we find out.

18:01.447 --> 18:04.143
No. I think it's better I not be involved.

18:04.783 --> 18:05.875
I understand.

18:13.792 --> 18:18.126
I talked to Marshall. He'll confirm he's
working on page 47 if Sloane goes to him.

18:18.197 --> 18:20.461
And the taps are in place?

18:20.532 --> 18:24.366
- If Sloane alerts Prophet Five, we'll know.
- Thank you. Any word from Tom?

18:24.436 --> 18:28.133
He's connected with Renee. They should
be making contact with Koller soon.

18:33.245 --> 18:37.045
- We should get this going.
- We're following Koller's protocol.

18:37.116 --> 18:41.416
- It's ten o'clock.
- It's 9':59.

18:41.487 --> 18:43.717
I didn't realize the French
were so punctual.

18:43.789 --> 18:48.055
We're not. It's you Americans
who are always in a hurry.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.755
And we get fat, too.
Is there anything else?

18:50.829 --> 18:52.694
(bell chimes)

18:52.764 --> 18:55.324
- Now it's ten o'clock.
- (cell phone beeps)

18:56.168 --> 18:58.159
(phone rings)

19:02.941 --> 19:03.771
Allo?

19:03.842 --> 19:05.935
(speaking French)

19:06.011 --> 19:06.807
Renee?

19:58.797 --> 20:01.027
We're on.

20:14.179 --> 20:16.010
(sighs)

20:21.153 --> 20:22.984
(dials)

20:26.725 --> 20:28.886
We need to meet.

20:30.829 --> 20:32.660
Tonight.

20:46.311 --> 20:49.610
- How's lsabelle?
- She's asleep, finally.

20:50.616 --> 20:52.607
- I'm all yours.
- You shouldn't stay up.

20:52.684 --> 20:55.209
You must be exhausted.

20:55.287 --> 20:58.017
- What about you?
- It's strange.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.320
I've already missed so much time.

21:00.392 --> 21:03.088
I wish I'd been here for you,
with all that's happened.

21:03.161 --> 21:08.224
I know. And I know what it's like
to have part of your life taken from you.

21:09.935 --> 21:12.836
For what it's worth, it gets easier.

21:14.172 --> 21:17.573
My father wanted me to stay with him
but I couldn't.

21:17.643 --> 21:23.172
Ever since he came into my life, it's always
the same. I don't want to get hurt anymore.

21:23.248 --> 21:27.412
I don't blame you.
You have every right to be guarded.

21:27.486 --> 21:33.083
But... you should know that while you were
sick, he was completely devoted to you.

21:34.026 --> 21:36.494
I've never seen him
so dedicated to anything.

21:36.561 --> 21:38.620
Even Rambaldi?

21:38.697 --> 21:41.131
From what I've seen, even Rambaldi.

21:42.734 --> 21:46.693
You can stay here as long as you want,
so long as you don't mind a crying baby.

21:46.772 --> 21:50.264
Are you crazy?
I love having so much life around me.

21:50.342 --> 21:52.333
(phone rings)

21:53.912 --> 21:56.904
It's my dad. Hey, Dad.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.450
- Sloane set a meet.
- When?

21:59.518 --> 22:01.816
Tonight. I'm gonna surveil it.

22:01.887 --> 22:05.379
- I thought you should know.
- I'll wait for your call.

22:09.094 --> 22:11.085
What is it?

22:13.332 --> 22:15.323
There's something you should know.

22:20.872 --> 22:23.272
(central locking beeps)

22:27.045 --> 22:29.479
- Nadia.
- Sydney told me what you're doing.

22:29.548 --> 22:31.641
- I want to go with you.
- Sure that's wise?

22:31.717 --> 22:35.676
Whatever you're about to find out
about my father, I need to know.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.846
All right. Let'sgo.

22:57.075 --> 22:59.737
(speaks French)

23:11.456 --> 23:13.686
- (radio beeps)
- Security is armed.

23:15.026 --> 23:16.926
Aren't they always?

23:17.462 --> 23:19.657
Just try to buy me a couple more minutes.

23:19.731 --> 23:23.428
(# "Practice What You Preach"
by Barry White on stereo)

23:25.504 --> 23:26.562
(speaks French)

23:32.978 --> 23:34.570
Wow.

23:36.515 --> 23:37.777
Uh...

23:38.784 --> 23:40.251
Non?

24:01.640 --> 24:03.631
Si tu veux...

24:11.883 --> 24:13.111
Mm-hm.

24:18.256 --> 24:21.817
- Ah. Il y a juste un peu...
- (cork pops)

24:28.400 --> 24:29.492
Mm-hm.

24:33.605 --> 24:36.631
Renee. Almost there.

25:06.938 --> 25:08.496
(Tom on radio) Three. two...

25:22.687 --> 25:25.520
- I hate that word.
- I'll remember that.

25:33.265 --> 25:35.859
- (Nadia) You finally got the Ford Hybrid.
- Electric.

25:35.934 --> 25:38.494
Comes in handy
when you have to be quiet.

25:45.043 --> 25:50.413
Regardless of what we find, I believe
your father's feelings for you are genuine.

25:50.482 --> 25:52.780
I wish there was enough room.

25:56.855 --> 25:59.722
Sloane's not the only family you have,
you know.

26:02.294 --> 26:04.285
Thank you.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.102
- (unbuckles belt)
- What are you doing?

26:15.173 --> 26:17.573
We can't see anything from here.

26:30.155 --> 26:32.146
Come on.

27:14.633 --> 27:18.501
- What were they saying?
- I couldn't make it out.

27:20.739 --> 27:22.730
- (clunk)
- We're in.

27:43.194 --> 27:45.355
Sloane took something from in here.

27:50.201 --> 27:52.362
- Clothes?
- Mine.

27:54.172 --> 27:56.470
These are my things.

27:56.541 --> 27:58.941
He was getting them for you.

28:00.478 --> 28:02.469
I don't knowwhat the rest of this is.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.948
- Findings from clinical trials.
- Trials for what?

28:08.019 --> 28:11.477
Studies from a facility in Barcelona.

28:13.958 --> 28:17.450
It appears that I misjudged your father.

28:19.597 --> 28:21.462
Help!

28:21.533 --> 28:24.297
Dear God, someone! Anyone!

28:24.369 --> 28:26.360
Help!

28:28.273 --> 28:30.764
Are you done yet?

28:30.842 --> 28:34.039
Please.
I don't know what you want from me.

28:34.112 --> 28:37.047
We want information about Anna Espinosa.

28:37.115 --> 28:39.481
I... I-I can't help you.

28:39.551 --> 28:43.988
Yes, you can. We know she hired you
to decode a message in this.

28:44.055 --> 28:48.185
I don't have the slightest idea
what you're talking about. Anna who?

28:49.227 --> 28:51.752
I know you're trying to do right
by your client,

28:51.830 --> 28:55.596
but we both know you are not cut out
to withstand extended interrogation.

28:55.667 --> 28:59.660
You're just some unlucky bookworm
who's in way over his head.

28:59.738 --> 29:04.732
- Please don't hurt me!
- Then stop screaming and talk.

29:04.809 --> 29:08.108
I've a meet set with Anna
tomorrow, in Ghana.

29:08.179 --> 29:10.841
Does she know what the message was?

29:10.915 --> 29:12.212
No.

29:12.283 --> 29:14.751
- I want to get paid.
- Why wouldn't she pay you?

29:14.819 --> 29:17.151
Annadoesn'tlike bad news.

29:18.823 --> 29:20.984
The document.

29:21.059 --> 29:23.027
It's a fake.

29:23.094 --> 29:26.757
Very well done but... but a fake.

29:28.199 --> 29:30.759
- And you believe him?
- (Tom) He has no reason to lie.

29:30.835 --> 29:34.327
He found a small amount of
titanium dioxide in the pigment.

29:34.405 --> 29:37.067
That means the document
can't be older than 80 years.

29:37.142 --> 29:39.906
Give or take a decade.
How do you wanna proceed?

29:39.978 --> 29:43.846
We keep the meet. We can still use Moritz
and the counterfeit page to bait Anna.

29:43.915 --> 29:45.405
Guess I'll see you in Ghana.

29:45.483 --> 29:48.350
Andthe real one?Where is it?

30:32.330 --> 30:34.321
(door bell)

30:48.313 --> 30:50.508
- Nadia.
- I'm sorry. I should have called.

30:50.582 --> 30:55.178
No, of course not. I... Hm.
I thought you were staying at Sydney's.

30:55.253 --> 31:00.555
Sydney went to Ghana. They're going after
Anna. But that's not the reason I'm here.

31:00.625 --> 31:02.456
I was hoping I could stay with you.

31:02.527 --> 31:06.930
Maybe we can take some time,
get to know each other again, if it's OK.

31:06.998 --> 31:09.159
How could you even ask that?

31:10.001 --> 31:11.992
Come in, sweetheart.

31:21.279 --> 31:23.873
This is my favorite sweater.

31:23.948 --> 31:26.075
I remembered.

31:26.150 --> 31:28.414
Thank you.

31:30.555 --> 31:32.921
Chamomile.

31:32.991 --> 31:35.585
You remembered that too.

31:39.530 --> 31:42.294
I need to admit something to you.

31:46.738 --> 31:49.969
I didn't think you'd want to be with me at all.

31:51.509 --> 31:54.774
Especially not after
what my actions caused for you.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.741
I've been quite angry.

31:58.716 --> 32:01.310
Well, you have every right to be angry.

32:05.823 --> 32:10.021
Nadia, when I first met you
I didn't know how to be a father.

32:11.396 --> 32:13.421
I assumed it meant being needed.

32:17.235 --> 32:23.140
And then I saw you lying in the hospital
in that bed, and I realized something.

32:25.209 --> 32:29.373
I realized that I need you
more than you will ever need me.

32:33.618 --> 32:36.109
I'm sorry.

32:36.187 --> 32:39.850
I promised myself
I wouldn't put any pressure on you.

32:39.924 --> 32:42.188
It's no pressure.

32:46.097 --> 32:47.689
Dinner's almost ready.

32:47.765 --> 32:50.290
- You need some help?
- No.

33:37.448 --> 33:40.042
Let me explain.

33:40.118 --> 33:43.212
- Nadia, you're going to have to trust me.
- You said it was over.

33:43.287 --> 33:45.847
- It's not how it looks.
- You've been lying all along.

33:45.923 --> 33:48.824
I handed everything over to the DSR
except for that page.

33:48.893 --> 33:52.021
I couldn't part with it.
I'd spent so much time...

33:52.096 --> 33:54.121
I don't want more excuses.

33:54.198 --> 33:58.066
Just talking about Rambaldi,
your face, your voice, it all changes.

33:58.136 --> 34:01.799
- This obsession you have...
- No, it's not an obsession.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.704
It's faith.

34:03.775 --> 34:07.438
Do you have any idea
what your faith cost me?

34:07.912 --> 34:10.813
What did you think?
That I was sleeping peacefully?

34:10.882 --> 34:14.045
The last 1 2 months were an extended nap?

34:15.018 --> 34:19.683
I heard people talking.
I felt tubes being shoved down my throat.

34:20.958 --> 34:27.261
I couldn't open my eyes, I couldn't move,
I couldn't scream, but I felt everything.

34:27.331 --> 34:31.859
So forgive me if I don't have
much tolerance for your faith.

34:31.936 --> 34:33.426
Nadia.

34:33.504 --> 34:35.529
Please.

34:35.606 --> 34:39.735
- You have to understand.
- I'm done trying to understand you!

34:40.411 --> 34:42.743
You have to make a choice.

34:44.148 --> 34:46.378
Either me or this.

34:46.451 --> 34:51.911
Please, don't make me choose between
the two most important things in my life.

34:53.791 --> 34:56.453
I suppose, then, you lose us both.

35:00.965 --> 35:02.796
No!

35:02.867 --> 35:04.596
My God, the message!

35:06.771 --> 35:09.035
- You're not getting it.
- Get out of my way.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.439
- Stop, please. Stop it!
- Nadia, move.

35:15.046 --> 35:16.877
(Sloane) No!

35:25.790 --> 35:27.655
Nadia.

35:33.064 --> 35:35.055
(breathes shakily)

36:01.592 --> 36:06.427
This place - crazy crowded. And I'm not
talking mall crowded. People, cars, goats.

36:06.497 --> 36:09.989
That's why Anna chose it. Hard to surveil.
How are we apprehending her?

36:10.067 --> 36:12.058
Yeah, mm-hm.

36:13.404 --> 36:16.532
Visual aids here, courtesy of Mitchell.

36:16.607 --> 36:18.802
Huh? Vroom vroom!

36:20.511 --> 36:25.210
OK, um, well, we have Anna, who will be
arriving on the main road right here.

36:25.283 --> 36:29.549
Now, uh, let's see. Dixon and Rachel
will be stationed right here.

36:29.620 --> 36:32.248
- Are the exits secured?
- Yeah.

36:32.323 --> 36:35.554
Tom will be cutting off the back, and...

36:36.394 --> 36:42.424
Sydney will - sorry, Syd -
be at the entrance. So here comes Anna...

36:42.500 --> 36:46.061
- Notify me when they have her in custody.
- I wasn't done with the...

36:46.137 --> 36:48.230
- It's fine, thank you.
- The car was...

36:48.306 --> 36:50.297
I get it.

37:03.487 --> 37:06.718
Everybody's getting set up.
When you see Anna, take her out with this.

37:06.791 --> 37:09.225
Government issue.
Never thought I'd have one of these.

37:09.293 --> 37:12.922
- Don't get excited. It's only a trade gun.
- That's too bad.

37:14.532 --> 37:17.797
Have you given any more thought
to my offer? About APO?

37:17.868 --> 37:20.701
Yeah. I work better on my own schedule.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.571
- When are you gonna trust me?
- I trust you.

37:23.641 --> 37:26.633
It's everyone else that's the problem.

37:27.945 --> 37:30.539
OK, go.

37:46.564 --> 37:51.399
- Beautiful jewelry for beautiful lady.
- No cash, sorry. I'm a starving student.

38:03.381 --> 38:06.111
- Is everything all right?
- Wonderful...

38:06.183 --> 38:08.310
considering I might get killed today.

38:08.386 --> 38:11.116
Relax. We've got you covered.

38:22.233 --> 38:24.064
Good.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.873
This will be fine, thank you.

39:01.739 --> 39:04.299
- Target approaching.
- Copy.

39:06.077 --> 39:08.238
Copy that.

39:16.454 --> 39:19.890
(Renee) What's going on?
She's not getting out.

39:22.126 --> 39:24.959
(Dixon) Something's not right.

39:26.263 --> 39:28.891
(Sydney on radio) Hold your positions.

39:32.403 --> 39:34.894
- They're retreating.
- (man shouts)

39:35.606 --> 39:38.234
(man shouts. woman screams)

39:39.777 --> 39:42.473
- (Renee) I've lost visual.
- (Dixon) Don't let her escape.

39:42.546 --> 39:45.674
- Anna's car's heading for the entrance.
- (Sydney) Rachel, follow.

39:45.750 --> 39:49.117
- Copy that.
- Renee, block off the back alleys.

39:50.821 --> 39:55.053
- (Dixon) She knows it's an ambush!
- (Tom) Someone tipped her off.

40:11.242 --> 40:15.144
She's not here!
Repeat: Anna is not in the car.

40:15.212 --> 40:16.941
Copy.

40:17.014 --> 40:20.347
She must have gotten out.
Let's search the perimeter.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.654
Sydney.

40:34.732 --> 40:36.825
(whispers) Sydney.

40:36.901 --> 40:39.597
(Sloane) A few days ago.
I was absolutely horrified

40:39.670 --> 40:42.639
that you would suggest
I'd turn against APO.

40:42.706 --> 40:46.005
that I would kill my own daughter.

40:46.076 --> 40:48.601
I realize now that both were inevitable.

40:49.613 --> 40:53.049
that death is a necessary sacrifice.

40:53.117 --> 40:56.348
necessary to complete
the final leg of this journey.

41:06.530 --> 41:10.193
I have been preparing for this
my whole life.

41:11.669 --> 41:14.001
I knew it was coming.

41:19.810 --> 41:23.211
I have betrayed everyone I ever loved.

41:24.348 --> 41:27.044
But I was chosen.

41:32.590 --> 41:36.959
- (man) We appreciate what you've done.
- This is my road to follow.

41:39.930 --> 41:42.160
Welcome back.

42:47.164 --> 42:48.688
(children) Bad robot!
