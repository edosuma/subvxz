00:10.920 --> 00:14.840
Looking down from two miles above the surface of the Earth

00:14.840 --> 00:17.320
it's impossible not to be impressed

00:17.320 --> 00:20.680
by the sheer grandeur and splendour

00:20.680 --> 00:23.080
and power of the natural world.

00:26.520 --> 00:30.000
Ten years ago, in a television series called Planet Earth,

00:30.000 --> 00:35.440
we revealed many of those wonders, but today, much has changed.

00:37.680 --> 00:41.840
We can now show life on our planet in entirely new ways.

00:44.240 --> 00:47.840
Bring you closer to animals than ever before.

00:50.880 --> 00:55.640
And reveal new wildlife dramas for the very first time.

00:59.240 --> 01:00.720
But that's not all.

01:01.840 --> 01:04.680
Our planet has changed too.

01:04.680 --> 01:08.920
Never have those wildernesses been as fragile and as precious

01:08.920 --> 01:10.440
as they are today.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.600
At this crucial time for the natural world,

01:16.600 --> 01:19.920
we will journey to every corner of the globe...

01:21.520 --> 01:24.480
..to explore the greatest treasures of our living planet...

01:31.360 --> 01:35.320
..and reveal the extreme lengths animals go to

01:35.320 --> 01:36.680
to survive.

01:51.280 --> 01:55.440
Finally, we will explore our cities

01:55.440 --> 01:57.960
to see how life is adapting

01:57.960 --> 02:00.120
to the newest habitat on Earth.

02:02.480 --> 02:05.200
This is Planet Earth II.

02:45.280 --> 02:49.400
There are hundreds of thousands of islands,

02:49.400 --> 02:53.040
each one a world in miniature,

02:53.040 --> 02:56.040
a microcosm of our living planet.

02:57.840 --> 03:01.080
The struggles to survive on these remote lands

03:01.080 --> 03:05.240
reflect the challenges faced by all life on Earth.

03:15.840 --> 03:20.400
The tiny island of Escudo off the coast of Panama.

03:22.160 --> 03:26.360
Home to the pygmy three-toed sloth.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.920
This is a male and life here suits him well.

03:36.440 --> 03:39.880
Mangroves provide all the leaves he can eat

03:39.880 --> 03:43.240
and there are no predators to worry him.

03:45.200 --> 03:50.200
Island life may seem idyllic but it comes at a price.

03:51.840 --> 03:55.440
There are only a few hundred pygmy sloths in existence.

03:56.880 --> 03:59.000
And he needs a mate.

04:00.560 --> 04:03.680
SCREECHING

04:03.680 --> 04:05.680
That's an enticing call...

04:07.760 --> 04:08.800
..from a female.

04:11.640 --> 04:13.960
Somewhere out there.

04:16.839 --> 04:21.000
And this, for a sloth, is a quick reaction.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.840
FEMALE SCREECHES AGAIN

04:43.840 --> 04:47.560
The problem is, there's deep water between them.

04:49.280 --> 04:52.520
So what should any red-blooded sloth do?

04:57.840 --> 04:59.560
Swim, of course.

05:29.960 --> 05:31.480
Could this be her?

05:38.600 --> 05:42.040
He does his best to put on a turn of speed.

05:52.680 --> 05:54.800
But she's not the one.

05:54.800 --> 05:59.920
She already has a baby and she won't mate again until it leaves her

05:59.920 --> 06:01.600
in about six months' time.

06:08.720 --> 06:13.120
Even life on a paradise island can have its limitations.

06:16.640 --> 06:17.680
MORE SCREECHING

06:18.920 --> 06:21.280
But at least she can't be far away.

06:26.800 --> 06:32.040
The world's entire population of pygmy sloths is isolated

06:32.040 --> 06:35.600
on a speck of land no bigger than New York's Central Park.

06:38.800 --> 06:43.360
The size of an island has a huge influence on the fate

06:43.360 --> 06:45.160
of those cast away there.

06:49.880 --> 06:53.680
The island of Komodo in Indonesia.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.240
Home to dragons.

07:23.560 --> 07:28.720
Ten feet long and weighing an impressive 150 lbs,

07:28.720 --> 07:33.160
these are the largest living lizards on the planet.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.960
It's unusual to find large predators on islands.

07:51.680 --> 07:56.600
Yet, for four million years, the Komodo dragon has dominated here.

08:06.560 --> 08:09.720
It might seem there wouldn't be enough food

08:09.720 --> 08:12.960
to support such giants on this relatively small island.

08:14.520 --> 08:17.120
But reptiles, being cold-blooded,

08:17.120 --> 08:21.160
need only about a tenth of the food a carnivorous mammal would.

08:25.760 --> 08:28.880
A single meal will last a dragon a month.

08:32.400 --> 08:36.720
There are so successful that their only serious competition comes from

08:36.720 --> 08:38.480
others of their own kind.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.799
And there are some 2,000 of them here.

09:05.800 --> 09:11.040
This giant, however, isn't looking for food - he's looking for a mate.

09:15.040 --> 09:18.760
Female dragons come into season only once a year.

09:29.160 --> 09:30.480
She's receptive.

09:38.560 --> 09:40.800
So far, so good.

09:45.240 --> 09:47.960
But he's strayed into someone else's patch.

09:53.680 --> 09:58.360
Another huge male thinks he is the king here.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.720
Space being limited on islands,

10:05.720 --> 10:10.720
dragon territories overlap and that creates continual conflict.

10:18.200 --> 10:21.480
In dragon society, size is everything.

10:36.680 --> 10:41.320
But if rivals are closely matched, the outcome can be uncertain.

10:48.720 --> 10:52.560
Muscular tails strike with the power of sledgehammers.

11:02.360 --> 11:06.600
And their serrated teeth are as sharp as steak knives.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.720
Each tries to topple his opponent.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.040
Defeated.

11:44.240 --> 11:47.080
Only the most powerful dragons

11:47.080 --> 11:48.720
win the right to mate.

11:57.120 --> 12:01.040
The limited food and space on small islands

12:01.040 --> 12:03.560
can often lead to intense competition.

12:04.760 --> 12:07.520
But some islands are immense.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.560
More like miniature continents.

12:11.880 --> 12:17.080
And these provide opportunities for life to experiment and evolve.

12:21.840 --> 12:27.320
Madagascar is one of the biggest islands and also one of the oldest,

12:27.320 --> 12:32.160
having split away from Africa over 120 million years ago.

12:43.200 --> 12:45.080
With time and isolation,

12:45.080 --> 12:50.080
its animals have adapted to take advantage of every available niche.

12:56.120 --> 13:01.400
The island now has some 250,000 different species,

13:01.400 --> 13:04.320
most found nowhere else on Earth.

13:16.640 --> 13:19.520
These are not monkeys, but lemurs.

13:25.160 --> 13:29.560
From a single ancestor, about 100 different types have evolved.

13:34.800 --> 13:38.920
The largest, the indri, seldom comes down from the branches.

13:46.080 --> 13:50.640
The much smaller ringtails wander in troops across the forest floor

13:50.640 --> 13:51.800
searching for food.

13:53.520 --> 13:57.720
And tiny bamboo lemurs eat nothing except bamboo.

14:05.520 --> 14:09.360
With few competitors, lemurs have been free to colonise

14:09.360 --> 14:12.000
almost every environment on the island.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.040
Even the most extreme.

14:24.560 --> 14:28.840
This baby sifaka has a hard life ahead of it.

14:33.480 --> 14:36.680
He's been born in the most arid and hostile corner

14:36.680 --> 14:39.160
of Madagascar's vast landscape.

14:41.960 --> 14:45.200
If he is to survive here, he has much to learn.

14:52.640 --> 14:54.960
The spiny forest is like a desert.

14:56.480 --> 15:01.240
It rarely rains, so water and food is very hard to find.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.640
Moving from tree to tree is a perilous business.

15:14.640 --> 15:18.680
Here, nearly all the plants are covered with ferocious spines.

15:20.840 --> 15:24.120
His mother searches the tree tops for the youngest leaves.

15:26.520 --> 15:30.280
They provide the only food and water to sustain the family.

15:36.760 --> 15:40.600
At three months old, the youngster is starting to explore.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.840
All too soon he will have to fend for himself up here.

15:55.520 --> 15:59.520
But it's altogether easier to stay on mother's back.

16:07.560 --> 16:10.600
If he can master the strange ways of this forest...

16:11.800 --> 16:14.720
..he will have a little corner of Madagascar to himself.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.960
Island life encourages animals to do things differently.

16:26.400 --> 16:29.400
And on some islands that is essential.

16:44.040 --> 16:46.440
There are islands still forming today...

16:47.800 --> 16:49.600
..built by volcanoes.

16:53.120 --> 16:55.000
Some erupt explosively.

17:02.040 --> 17:04.920
Others pour out rivers of molten rock.

17:06.040 --> 17:07.079
Lava.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.839
In the last 50 years,

17:14.839 --> 17:17.880
ten new volcanic islands have been formed.

17:45.080 --> 17:50.240
Newly created and often remote, they're hard for colonists to reach.

17:53.840 --> 17:57.920
Even those that do find these are tough places to survive.

18:03.840 --> 18:08.440
This is Fernandina, one of the Galapagos Islands in the Pacific.

18:10.800 --> 18:15.160
Young and still volcanically active, it's a desolate place.

18:29.600 --> 18:33.840
The surrounding sea, however, is particularly rich with life.

18:38.000 --> 18:42.720
And the frontier between these two very different worlds is the home of

18:42.720 --> 18:44.880
one of the strangest of reptiles.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.480
Seagoing iguanas.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.760
They are vegetarians,

18:55.760 --> 18:58.840
but since there's little food for them on the land,

18:58.840 --> 19:01.840
marine iguanas graze on the sea floor.

19:06.120 --> 19:09.040
A big male like this one can dive to 30 metres

19:09.040 --> 19:11.520
and hold his breath for half an hour.

19:37.520 --> 19:42.120
There are more than 7,000 individuals on Fernandina alone.

19:50.400 --> 19:53.360
And by bringing nutrients from the sea to the land,

19:53.360 --> 19:56.520
the iguanas help other animals to survive here, too.

20:00.480 --> 20:03.880
Crabs feed on dead skin on the iguana's back

20:03.880 --> 20:07.920
and, in turn, provide a welcome exfoliation service.

20:15.760 --> 20:19.680
While smaller lizards prey on the flies that pester the colony.

20:42.080 --> 20:46.520
But not all the relationships on this island are so harmonious.

20:53.120 --> 20:55.760
Marine iguanas lay their eggs in sand.

20:58.280 --> 21:02.240
In June, when the hatchlings emerge, they are vulnerable.

21:06.320 --> 21:09.800
They must join the adults at the edge of the sea.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.120
But the journey will be a dangerous one.

21:37.400 --> 21:38.840
Racer snakes.

22:08.520 --> 22:10.680
The snakes miss their chance.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.000
But more babies are hatching.

22:26.560 --> 22:29.320
And now the snakes are on the alert.

22:30.640 --> 22:34.680
This is the best feeding opportunity they will get all year.

22:50.360 --> 22:55.120
On flat ground, a baby iguana can outrun a racer snake.

22:56.880 --> 22:58.920
But others are waiting in ambush.

23:26.440 --> 23:30.960
Another hatchling has its first glimpse of a dangerous world.

24:28.920 --> 24:33.040
A snake's eyes aren't very good,

24:33.040 --> 24:34.760
but they can detect movement.

24:35.960 --> 24:40.600
So if the hatchling keeps its nerve, it may just avoid detection.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.240
A near miraculous escape.

26:21.360 --> 26:25.280
The lucky survivors can begin learning the unique way of life

26:25.280 --> 26:27.920
demanded by this hostile island.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.760
Although marine iguanas are expert swimmers,

26:39.760 --> 26:41.760
they can't cross open oceans.

26:50.960 --> 26:55.200
But even the stormiest waters are no barrier for birds.

27:05.040 --> 27:10.160
Gale force winds and cold temperatures make the sub-Antarctic

27:10.160 --> 27:13.920
islands off New Zealand particularly unwelcoming in winter.

27:26.920 --> 27:32.480
But, when the brief summer comes, temperatures rise and winds slacken.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.000
It's now that visitors arrive.

27:53.840 --> 27:57.480
All here to breed before winter returns.

27:59.840 --> 28:01.560
There's the Snares penguins.

28:10.200 --> 28:12.040
Shearwaters come, too.

28:14.920 --> 28:18.760
This is an excellent place for them to dig their nesting burrows,

28:18.760 --> 28:21.240
for no predators have managed to get here.

28:27.400 --> 28:30.840
Soon the island is crowded with birds.

28:32.400 --> 28:36.280
Every one of them eager to make the most of the short breeding season.

28:40.440 --> 28:43.080
But not everyone has a partner.

28:49.560 --> 28:52.960
A male Buller's albatross waits for his mate.

28:56.120 --> 29:00.280
Each year they spend six months apart, travelling the ocean.

29:05.720 --> 29:08.280
They reunite here to breed.

29:11.280 --> 29:13.320
But this year, she's late.

29:17.360 --> 29:19.320
No, that's not her.

29:23.640 --> 29:25.800
The other birds come and go.

29:36.040 --> 29:37.440
The clock is ticking.

29:38.760 --> 29:40.640
If she doesn't appear soon,

29:40.640 --> 29:43.480
it could be too late for them to breed successfully.

29:46.320 --> 29:50.560
Every morning the shearwaters fly off to collect food for their young.

30:08.480 --> 30:11.440
Everybody else seems to be getting on with it.

30:24.200 --> 30:28.200
The shearwaters' return marks another lost day.

30:30.560 --> 30:35.880
There are three million birds on the island, but only one matters to him.

30:43.120 --> 30:44.800
Could this be her?

30:51.440 --> 30:52.560
At last.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.320
At first, he's a little coy.

31:23.520 --> 31:24.920
But not for long.

31:32.360 --> 31:35.280
They greet each other with the special dance

31:35.280 --> 31:37.920
they've perfected over many years.

31:48.720 --> 31:54.240
There is much to do if they're to raise a chick before winter returns.

31:58.840 --> 32:03.840
But when you have been apart for six months, some things can't be rushed.

32:22.680 --> 32:28.600
Islands in warm tropical waters don't experience seasonal extremes.

32:31.800 --> 32:35.040
The Seychelles, lying off the coast of East Africa,

32:35.040 --> 32:37.920
provide a sanctuary for sea birds all the year round.

32:54.680 --> 32:57.640
Fairy terns are permanent residents.

32:59.120 --> 33:03.840
They take a fairly relaxed view about what constitutes a nest.

33:05.360 --> 33:07.520
A bare branch is quite enough.

33:16.240 --> 33:20.400
Climbing onto it to incubate has to be done with care.

33:29.560 --> 33:32.000
Once a year, the noddies arrive.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.360
They do make nests,

33:35.360 --> 33:38.000
and pisonia trees provide their young

33:38.000 --> 33:41.240
with a rather less precarious start in life.

33:47.920 --> 33:50.200
Nesting on this island looks idyllic.

33:51.840 --> 33:55.760
But behind the beauty, there's a sinister side.

34:00.320 --> 34:05.200
The Seychelles fody makes quick work of an unattended egg.

34:20.480 --> 34:23.280
She knows something's not quite right,

34:23.280 --> 34:25.600
but her drive to incubate is strong.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.400
The noddies too have a problem.

34:46.520 --> 34:48.320
As their chicks grow,

34:48.320 --> 34:52.440
so the pisonia trees develop seeds that are sticky

34:52.440 --> 34:54.440
and equipped with hooks.

34:59.520 --> 35:01.760
By the time the young noddies leave,

35:01.760 --> 35:05.960
they carry these hitchhiking seeds away to other islands.

35:12.440 --> 35:16.520
But sometimes the pisonia trees are too successful.

35:22.240 --> 35:26.520
If a fledgling, testing out its wings, drops to the ground,

35:26.520 --> 35:28.800
it can get covered with the seeds.

35:37.200 --> 35:42.200
Entangled and weighed down, if it can't free itself,

35:42.200 --> 35:43.640
the youngster will starve.

35:57.120 --> 36:01.000
The pisonia may have failed to disperse these seeds...

36:02.600 --> 36:06.280
..but it will soon have fertiliser for its roots.

36:12.640 --> 36:18.280
This is why some people call the pisonia the "bird catcher tree".

36:51.640 --> 36:54.640
The fairy tern laid another egg,

36:54.640 --> 36:57.640
and now she has a tiny chick to feed.

37:04.160 --> 37:05.640
This chick is lucky.

37:08.400 --> 37:12.440
By the time it fledges, the pisonia seeds will have dispersed,

37:12.440 --> 37:14.840
and the danger they brought will be gone.

37:26.080 --> 37:30.280
Even the most idyllic-looking of islands presents challenges

37:30.280 --> 37:31.960
for the animals living there.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.440
But the greatest threat they face is change.

37:53.360 --> 37:55.960
Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.320
For millions of years,

37:59.320 --> 38:03.240
this remote speck of land has been ruled by crabs.

38:09.600 --> 38:12.320
Their ancestors came from the sea,

38:12.320 --> 38:16.600
but most have now adopted a land-based existence.

38:25.600 --> 38:30.000
Given there are so many of them, they get on relatively harmoniously.

38:32.520 --> 38:38.240
They're the gardeners and caretakers of a tiny crab utopia.

38:42.040 --> 38:45.040
Once a year, they must all return to the sea to breed,

38:45.040 --> 38:47.720
and the march of the red crabs

38:47.720 --> 38:51.800
is one of the greatest natural spectacles on earth.

39:03.480 --> 39:05.960
There are 50 million of them.

39:12.600 --> 39:16.920
It's an event that has brought the island worldwide fame.

39:27.920 --> 39:29.480
But in recent years,

39:29.480 --> 39:33.240
millions of red crabs haven't managed to reach the sea.

39:39.440 --> 39:42.360
An invader has occupied this island.

39:45.440 --> 39:47.480
Yellow crazy ants.

39:48.560 --> 39:52.880
They escaped from visiting ships and with no predators to control them,

39:52.880 --> 39:57.000
they have now created vast super colonies in the forest.

40:02.960 --> 40:07.560
When migrating red crabs march into their territory, the ants attack.

40:09.280 --> 40:12.680
Squirting acid into the crabs' eyes and mouths.

40:22.880 --> 40:25.040
The crabs have no defence.

40:28.680 --> 40:30.520
Blinded and confused...

40:31.760 --> 40:32.960
..they're doomed.

40:44.440 --> 40:47.920
Humans brought these ant invaders here,

40:47.920 --> 40:50.400
and now humans are having to control them.

40:54.240 --> 40:59.680
Isolated communities may evolve from millions of years in relative peace.

41:01.200 --> 41:05.240
But, when new challenges arrive, they can struggle to cope.

41:08.080 --> 41:12.640
Of all the species that have become extinct in recent years,

41:12.640 --> 41:15.560
around 80% have been islanders.

41:18.160 --> 41:23.920
Our impact on the Earth is greater today than ever before.

41:25.480 --> 41:27.560
Yet some islands are so remote

41:27.560 --> 41:30.480
that few humans have even set foot on them.

41:34.280 --> 41:36.240
Zavodovski Island is one.

41:40.560 --> 41:43.400
It lies in the great Southern Ocean.

41:43.400 --> 41:46.680
It's not only surrounded by the stormiest of seas,

41:46.680 --> 41:49.240
it is itself an active volcano.

41:52.160 --> 41:55.240
It's the last place on Earth you would choose to live.

42:04.360 --> 42:07.280
Unless you're a chinstrap penguin.

42:10.080 --> 42:13.480
There is plenty of food in these waters, but to exploit it,

42:13.480 --> 42:15.640
the penguins have to risk their lives.

43:04.800 --> 43:08.360
Life here is dangerous in the extreme.

43:22.160 --> 43:24.360
PENGUINS CHATTER

43:25.640 --> 43:29.120
But there are some benefits from living on a volcano.

43:31.680 --> 43:35.880
Its warmth melts the snow early in the year.

43:35.880 --> 43:39.320
And, by January, the Antarctic's mid-summer,

43:39.320 --> 43:41.680
the island is covered in chicks.

43:46.160 --> 43:48.640
Parents take turns at guarding them

43:48.640 --> 43:51.960
until they're large enough to be left alone.

43:56.400 --> 44:01.400
This mother's chicks are hungry, but she has no food left to give them.

44:03.160 --> 44:07.240
Their survival depends on their father returning with the next meal.

44:11.720 --> 44:13.360
But some don't make it.

44:27.520 --> 44:31.760
Skuas harass the colony, hoping to snatch a chick.

44:39.320 --> 44:41.120
She can't risk leaving them.

44:46.200 --> 44:50.040
Everything will be fine, as long as their father comes back soon.

45:19.360 --> 45:24.360
He's been fishing 50 miles offshore, but now he's not far away.

45:27.360 --> 45:30.760
For him, however, and for all the other parents here,

45:30.760 --> 45:33.080
the worst of the journey is still to come.

46:05.280 --> 46:09.640
Tiny claws help him to get whatever grip he can on the rough lava.

46:37.520 --> 46:40.400
For these commuters, it's rush hour.

46:42.040 --> 46:44.760
Some have had a really bad day.

46:49.080 --> 46:53.360
The father now has a two-mile walk to the nest,

46:53.360 --> 46:55.800
and a stomach loaded with food doesn't help.

47:02.880 --> 47:06.520
This is the largest penguin colony in the world.

47:13.560 --> 47:16.920
But as he makes the same journey every other day,

47:16.920 --> 47:19.960
he should be able to do it with his eyes closed.

47:28.560 --> 47:31.720
It's true that there can be safety in numbers,

47:31.720 --> 47:34.200
but numbers can also be something of a problem

47:34.200 --> 47:36.600
when you're trying to find your own nest.

47:43.120 --> 47:45.000
The mother is still waiting.

47:47.200 --> 47:49.080
Her chicks are now desperate.

47:49.080 --> 47:50.880
THEY CHEEP

47:55.040 --> 47:57.760
In the midst of all this deafening chorus,

47:57.760 --> 47:59.800
he can recognise her particular cry.

48:19.640 --> 48:21.000
At last.

48:36.120 --> 48:38.480
Both chicks will get a meal.

48:45.360 --> 48:50.160
With a head bob of acknowledgement, their mother now leaves.

48:50.160 --> 48:53.360
It's her turn to do the feeding run.

48:59.720 --> 49:06.400
This formidable commute is the price these penguins pay for sanctuary.

49:12.240 --> 49:15.760
A strange vision of paradise to us, perhaps,

49:15.760 --> 49:21.560
but, for one and a half million penguins, this island has it all.

49:32.160 --> 49:36.080
Islands may seem remote and insignificant,

49:36.080 --> 49:40.880
but they are home to some of the most precious wildlife on Earth.

50:03.640 --> 50:06.720
The expedition to film on the island of Zavodovski

50:06.720 --> 50:09.320
was the most intrepid shoot of the series.

50:10.320 --> 50:13.600
To ensure its success, the team have called in

50:13.600 --> 50:16.080
Antarctic expert Jerome Poncet,

50:16.080 --> 50:19.240
one of the few people to have set foot on the island.

50:21.560 --> 50:25.320
This whole region of Antarctica is rarely visited.

50:29.320 --> 50:32.400
And this is the planet's roughest ocean.

50:41.120 --> 50:43.680
After seven long days and nights at sea,

50:43.680 --> 50:46.600
they get their first glimpse of the final destination.

50:46.600 --> 50:49.600
It's actually quite surreal after a whole year,

50:49.600 --> 50:51.480
trying to put the expedition together.

50:51.480 --> 50:53.840
And then today we wake up, and there's the volcano.

50:53.840 --> 50:55.320
That's Zavodovski.

50:56.520 --> 50:59.400
The explorers who discovered this place

50:59.400 --> 51:02.600
spoke of the stench of sulphurous gases,

51:02.600 --> 51:05.320
treacherous waters,

51:05.320 --> 51:07.920
and astonishing numbers of penguins.

51:11.600 --> 51:13.800
It seems not much has changed.

51:15.400 --> 51:17.600
Jerome's been round the whole place,

51:17.600 --> 51:20.560
and there literally is only one safe area to get on,

51:20.560 --> 51:21.720
and he's telling us

51:21.720 --> 51:23.400
it's that rock face over there.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.040
The team must take everything they need to survive.

51:30.400 --> 51:31.800
There are the penguins!

51:34.000 --> 51:35.600
Though the boat'll stay nearby,

51:35.600 --> 51:37.520
they will need to be self-sufficient.

51:38.880 --> 51:42.560
But that means taking a tonne of equipment up this cliff.

51:42.560 --> 51:45.200
Just get to that lot to help.

51:45.200 --> 51:46.800
Many flippers make light work.

51:49.600 --> 51:51.920
They work all day getting the gear ashore.

51:54.920 --> 51:58.080
But the fact there are so many penguins on the island

51:58.080 --> 51:59.680
doesn't make it easy.

52:00.880 --> 52:03.600
The hardest thing for us has been finding a pathway through,

52:03.600 --> 52:06.920
because there's absolutely penguins everywhere you look.

52:13.840 --> 52:16.000
Finally, it's time to make camp.

52:21.120 --> 52:24.760
They choose a sheltered place that won't disturb the locals.

52:26.320 --> 52:30.120
But since most of the penguins won't have seen a human being before,

52:30.120 --> 52:32.520
they seem keen to pop over and visit.

52:33.720 --> 52:36.240
- Hello. 
- Nosy neighbours.

52:38.000 --> 52:39.480
The team set off

52:39.480 --> 52:42.640
to start documenting the daily lives of the penguins,

52:42.640 --> 52:45.120
and what they find is astonishing.

52:46.120 --> 52:49.680
As soon as you walk over that ridge, you sort of get a tingly feeling,

52:49.680 --> 52:54.000
because I've never seen that many animals in one spot.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.520
It's mind-blowing.

52:57.800 --> 53:00.160
It's like Glastonbury Festival.

53:00.160 --> 53:01.400
The whole landscape

53:01.400 --> 53:05.480
is full of little black and white penguins waddling around.

53:09.760 --> 53:12.800
This is penguin paradise, and that's what we're trying to show.

53:17.720 --> 53:18.960
A promising start.

53:20.560 --> 53:23.560
But here, fortunes can change quickly.

53:27.560 --> 53:29.160
# Summertime... #

53:32.800 --> 53:35.040
Every season within ten minutes.

53:38.800 --> 53:42.880
As the snow melts, it creates an unforeseen problem.

53:44.920 --> 53:46.520
We purposely chose this campsite

53:46.520 --> 53:49.640
because it was a place where the penguins didn't seem to go.

53:49.640 --> 53:52.880
I think we've realised why the penguins don't nest here.

53:52.880 --> 53:55.760
It's because of the spray and because of some run-off,

53:55.760 --> 53:58.280
so we are literally in a bit of a bog.

53:59.440 --> 54:01.400
And it's not just mud.

54:03.320 --> 54:07.560
A couple of these guys, as they wander down to do a spot of fishing,

54:07.560 --> 54:11.960
they tend to use my tent as a little poop spot.

54:11.960 --> 54:13.760
You kind of get used to it at night,

54:13.760 --> 54:16.960
just hearing a constant splat on top of the tent.

54:16.960 --> 54:20.160
But, as you can see, all of the kit,

54:20.160 --> 54:23.760
I'm afraid that's getting splat on as well.

54:23.760 --> 54:27.360
And, when the wind changes, it brings a noxious reminder

54:27.360 --> 54:30.200
that they're camping on an active volcano.

54:32.560 --> 54:35.120
It's the first time we've smelt sulphur,

54:35.120 --> 54:38.360
which is welcome relief from smelling penguins.

54:38.360 --> 54:39.760
It's smoking away.

54:41.360 --> 54:44.400
I think if they start running for the sea,

54:44.400 --> 54:47.360
we're going to be calling Jerome pretty quick for the boat.

54:49.880 --> 54:54.040
Each day filming on Zavodovski seems to present a new challenge.

54:58.320 --> 55:01.280
Next, a huge storm hits the island.

55:04.320 --> 55:06.280
Only now do the team realise

55:06.280 --> 55:09.400
just how tough life can be for the penguins.

55:13.080 --> 55:16.440
It's hard not to be moved by the effort they go to

55:16.440 --> 55:18.040
to feed their chicks.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.480
These huge waves are coming in.

55:22.480 --> 55:24.480
The penguins are surfing here,

55:24.480 --> 55:26.640
getting battered on these big boulders.

55:26.640 --> 55:29.400
Now and then you just get a penguin that gets catapulted

55:29.400 --> 55:32.520
15 metres in the air - it's totally ludicrous.

55:34.880 --> 55:38.920
And really, I think there are quite a few penguins getting killed in it.

55:43.960 --> 55:48.080
The beach in the afternoon was just a scene of death and destruction.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.680
It was absolute carnage.

55:54.000 --> 55:55.160
It was heartbreaking.

55:55.160 --> 55:58.040
I mean, they're trying so hard to get up the beach with broken legs

55:58.040 --> 56:02.960
and bleeding and very, you know, sobering, really.

56:06.520 --> 56:10.160
After witnessing the struggles, the penguins must endure,

56:10.160 --> 56:12.320
the team now face the same problem.

56:13.600 --> 56:14.840
Getting off the island.

56:16.320 --> 56:20.440
With another storm coming in, they decide to take their chance.

56:22.480 --> 56:26.240
Jerome has seconds to get in and out between the waves.

56:27.360 --> 56:28.720
Or the Zodiac could tip...

56:30.080 --> 56:31.680
..leaving them all stranded.

56:32.880 --> 56:35.640
Hurray, that's the first box off the island.

56:40.800 --> 56:44.600
What took a day to get ashore must be off in minutes.

56:44.600 --> 56:46.200
And the swell is getting bigger.

56:48.280 --> 56:50.800
Their window of opportunity is closing.

56:52.480 --> 56:54.440
Look at this swell now, watch out, watch out!

57:00.920 --> 57:04.240
The equipment's off, but now the team has to follow.

57:09.160 --> 57:11.480
She's just leaving us now, is she?

57:11.480 --> 57:14.080
That's the producer, she's gone! We have to swim now.

57:16.640 --> 57:17.960
- They're gone. 
- Yeah.

57:19.120 --> 57:21.320
Luckily it didn't come to that.

57:25.960 --> 57:31.320
Safely aboard, they leave with an unforgettable experience

57:31.320 --> 57:35.640
of how hard life is on an island at the edge of the world.

57:40.200 --> 57:45.520
Next time, we ascend into the planet's highest peaks

57:45.520 --> 57:48.360
to discover a spectacular but hostile world,

57:48.360 --> 57:51.160
where only the toughest animals can endure.

57:54.000 --> 57:57.040
This is life on the roof of the world.

57:57.040 --> 57:58.360
Mountains.
