<i>My name is Marty Kaan,</i>

00:01.714 --> 00:03.013
<i>and I'm a management</i>
<i>consultant.</i>

00:03.047 --> 00:04.683
<i>Every week me and my team</i>
<i>go somewhere</i>

00:04.717 --> 00:07.648
<i>and talk people into thinking</i>
<i>they really, really need us.</i>

00:07.682 --> 00:10.348
<i>In a fight between</i>
<i>Greg Norbert and Marty Kaan...</i>

00:10.383 --> 00:11.481
Motherfucker.

00:11.516 --> 00:13.551
...all the fucking money
is on you.

00:13.585 --> 00:16.326
<i>She made me come more</i>

00:16.361 --> 00:17.898
in a toilet stall in six minutes

00:17.933 --> 00:20.468
than you have in
the past three years.

00:20.503 --> 00:22.206
<i>You could not resist</i>

00:22.240 --> 00:24.678
slapping around
Greg Norbert's manhood.

00:24.712 --> 00:26.516
I think you wish someone
would take you

00:26.553 --> 00:28.089
and fuck your brains out.

00:28.124 --> 00:29.727
'Cause whoever's doing it now

00:29.761 --> 00:31.697
<i>isn't doing it right.</i>

00:31.731 --> 00:34.168
I think we should have
the engagement party.

00:34.203 --> 00:35.838
<i>Still don't know exactly</i>
<i>what it is we do?</i>

00:35.872 --> 00:39.245

- Aw...
- What's wrong, what's wrong?

01:07.377 --> 01:08.912
God, what the fuck happened?

01:08.946 --> 01:10.713
You know, I think
you hit your dick.

01:10.747 --> 01:12.249
- I did?
- Yes.

01:12.283 --> 01:14.017
<i>We're beginning our descent
into Los Angeles.</i>

01:14.051 --> 01:15.485
<i>If you are just visiting
Los Angeles</i>

01:15.519 --> 01:17.453
<i>we hope you have
an enjoyable trip.</i>

01:17.488 --> 01:20.323
<i>If you live in the greater L.A.
area, welcome home.</i>

01:21.959 --> 01:24.761
Home.

01:24.795 --> 01:28.634
The place a management
consultant goes To...

01:28.635 --> 01:29.999
do his laundry.

01:31.401 --> 01:33.102
<i>...traveling to other
destinations,</i>

01:33.137 --> 01:35.940
<i>see your gate attendant
for your flight assignments.</i>

01:35.974 --> 01:38.643
<i>Have a wonderful day, and thank
you for flying with us.</i>

01:40.281 --> 01:43.917
We're on the road
Monday to Thursday every week,

01:43.952 --> 01:46.655
in the office Friday and then
back on the road Monday.

01:46.689 --> 01:51.862
So every week, every year, as
the mileage rewards accumulate,

01:51.896 --> 01:53.664
and the travel
hook-up points accrue,

01:53.698 --> 01:55.665
the meaning of home diminishes
proportionately

01:55.700 --> 01:59.537
until, for some of us, it's--
it's kind of like limbo.

02:01.640 --> 02:03.708
I know you just
checked out my ass.

02:03.742 --> 02:05.877
- What? He did not.
- What? He did.

02:05.911 --> 02:07.044
I may have.

02:07.079 --> 02:08.145
And?

02:08.180 --> 02:09.513
Not bad.

02:09.548 --> 02:11.749
Thank you.

02:13.418 --> 02:15.052
Hey, Jeannie, hold up.

02:15.087 --> 02:17.910
Hey, listen, it's the last weekend of
the national tour of <i>Wicked,</i>

02:17.911 --> 02:20.059
and I happen to have an
extra ticket for Saturday.

02:20.093 --> 02:22.095
- Oh, Lordy...
- Didn't want to ask the others, but...

02:22.130 --> 02:24.097
I-- you know what, I
actually have to get going,

02:24.132 --> 02:26.267
but I'm going to see you guys
bright and early tomorrow.

02:26.301 --> 02:28.103
Bye, Jeannie.

02:28.137 --> 02:29.638
Hey, Clyde, what do
you say, <i>Wicked?</i>

02:29.672 --> 02:32.007
Doug, I wish I could,
but I have to clean my oven,

02:32.041 --> 02:34.343
so I can stick my head
in it and kill myself.

02:34.378 --> 02:36.813
See, that's what I'd rather do
than go on a man date

02:36.847 --> 02:37.981
to <i>Wicked</i> with you.

02:38.015 --> 02:39.516
- Have a great day, though.
- Just say no.

02:39.550 --> 02:41.251
Just say no.

02:43.655 --> 02:45.556
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

02:45.591 --> 02:47.225
Sure.

02:47.259 --> 02:50.862
So you go home and do what you
can to cope with the shift.

HOUSE OF LIES
S01 Ep06 - Our Descent Into Los Angeles

03:19.362 --> 03:20.796
My dad smokes weed.

03:20.830 --> 03:23.098
Not mine.

03:23.133 --> 03:24.366
That's cool, too.

03:24.401 --> 03:26.201
Yeah?

03:26.236 --> 03:28.170
Would you ever?

03:28.204 --> 03:29.571
Smoke weed?

03:29.606 --> 03:32.274
No.

03:34.077 --> 03:36.011
What else wouldn't you do?

03:36.046 --> 03:37.480
I don't know, lots of stuff.

03:37.514 --> 03:40.650
What would you do?

03:40.684 --> 03:43.453
Lots of stuff.

03:49.294 --> 03:51.896
- He kissed me.
- No I didn't.

03:51.930 --> 03:54.165
You kissed me.

03:54.199 --> 03:57.635
I didn't. I considered it, but
I'm not that into him.

03:57.669 --> 03:59.704
- You did.
- I didn't.

03:59.738 --> 04:02.374
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.311
What?

04:06.345 --> 04:08.313
Marty, your 10:00 is here.

04:08.347 --> 04:09.472
I don't have a 10:00.

04:09.473 --> 04:11.883
You have somebody out
here who says you do.

04:21.327 --> 04:22.627
Mr. Kaan.

04:22.661 --> 04:26.451
Thank you so much for seeing
me on such short notice.

04:26.452 --> 04:27.398
My pleasure.

04:27.433 --> 04:29.467
Uh, right this way.

04:32.237 --> 04:35.273
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
baby, baby, baby, slow down.

04:35.307 --> 04:37.174
What are you doing here?

04:37.209 --> 04:38.575
You're not happy
to see me?

04:38.610 --> 04:39.743
Should I be?

04:39.777 --> 04:41.244
Are you nervous?

04:41.279 --> 04:43.480
- Marty Kaan is nervous.
- Sweetheart, I'm not nervous.

04:43.514 --> 04:46.782
Confused a little,
maybe befuddled,

04:46.817 --> 04:48.851
definitely horny,
but not nervous.

04:48.885 --> 04:51.586
What are you doing here?
I thought you were in New York.

04:51.621 --> 04:53.922
I got in.
USC-- full ride.

04:53.956 --> 04:55.390
What? You got into S.C.?

04:55.424 --> 04:57.058
- Future lawyer.
- Give it up.

04:57.092 --> 05:00.861
You may approach the bench.

05:05.100 --> 05:10.004
Mama, I think it's okay for you
to admit now that your move

05:10.038 --> 05:11.372
was a little about me.

05:11.407 --> 05:13.241
- I admit it.
- Yeah.

05:13.275 --> 05:15.010
I uprooted my life,
moved cross-country

05:15.044 --> 05:16.679
for a guy I met stripping.

05:16.713 --> 05:17.313
Uh-huh.

05:17.314 --> 05:19.715
So I could intermittently
relieve his boredom

05:19.749 --> 05:21.964
during the three days a
week he's off the road.

05:21.965 --> 05:22.518
Oh.

05:22.553 --> 05:24.553
Because I am so
in his thrall.

05:24.588 --> 05:26.456
- Doesn't that feel better...
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

05:26.491 --> 05:28.572
...just to get all that out
in the open like that?

05:28.573 --> 05:29.092
Mm-hmm.

05:30.728 --> 05:34.864
Oh, sweetheart,
you remember Greg Norbert?

05:34.898 --> 05:35.965
Greg Norbert...

05:35.999 --> 05:37.833
You turned out his wife?

05:39.469 --> 05:40.869
Right.

05:40.903 --> 05:42.264
Oh, I definitely
remember his wife.

05:42.265 --> 05:42.604
Yeah.

05:42.638 --> 05:44.072
She sexted me
a couple times.

05:44.106 --> 05:45.873
That is so sweet.

05:45.908 --> 05:47.207
But listen, he's here.

05:47.242 --> 05:48.909
He's trying to buy
the company.

05:48.943 --> 05:50.589
Marty the cat will
land on his feet.

05:50.590 --> 05:51.745
I don't know about that.

05:51.779 --> 05:53.313
See, I have this
non-compete clause

05:53.347 --> 05:54.581
in my contract.

05:54.615 --> 05:56.350
It means I can't just
take my talents

05:56.384 --> 05:58.786
and start working for the
competition across the street.

05:58.820 --> 06:01.756
- That's not good.
- No, it's not good at all.

06:01.790 --> 06:04.792
I'd prefer if Mr. Norbert
didn't find you here today.

06:04.827 --> 06:06.528
You must be so stressed.

06:06.562 --> 06:07.930
I can't even
talk about it.

06:07.964 --> 06:09.598
You know what,
come here.

06:09.632 --> 06:12.134
There are only a few things
that work for stress.

06:12.169 --> 06:12.496
Yeah?

06:12.497 --> 06:15.145
I've had a lot of success
with this particular...

06:15.146 --> 06:18.774
April, this is a bad idea
at this time, this place.

06:18.808 --> 06:20.736
I've done a lot of research.
It works.

06:20.737 --> 06:21.576
April, April...

06:21.610 --> 06:23.311
Oh, hello.

06:23.345 --> 06:24.479
Ohh!

06:24.513 --> 06:26.947
You're going to be
an excellent lawyer.

06:26.982 --> 06:28.348
Marty...

06:28.383 --> 06:31.084
Can I... Can we just
put all the animosity

06:31.119 --> 06:34.320
on hold for like five minutes?

06:34.355 --> 06:36.356
I just need a
sounding board, bro.

06:36.390 --> 06:38.157
It's my wife.

06:38.192 --> 06:40.260
Oh, my ex,

06:40.294 --> 06:42.162
I guess.

06:42.196 --> 06:43.797
Jesus, I can't even say it.

06:43.831 --> 06:47.367
I know she's younger and not
exactly a rocket scientist,

06:47.401 --> 06:48.935
but she has such pretty hair.

06:48.970 --> 06:51.838
Yeah, hey, Greg, I was... do you
think that it would be possible

06:51.872 --> 06:57.277
if we could just, uh... do this
at another... another time?

06:57.311 --> 06:58.678
Maybe in your office?

06:58.712 --> 07:00.446
You know, I think Skip
has bugged my office.

07:00.447 --> 07:00.880
No.

07:00.914 --> 07:03.669
I just feel like everything I'm
saying in there is being listened to.

07:03.670 --> 07:05.151
Just like someone's privy

07:05.185 --> 07:06.852
to my private...
Is everything okay?

07:06.886 --> 07:08.313
I have this back cramp
that's crazy...

07:08.314 --> 07:09.154
You know what, Marty?

07:09.189 --> 07:10.422
Hey, I'm not here on business.

07:10.456 --> 07:11.723
I'm not playing
you here, man.

07:11.758 --> 07:13.859
This is mano a mano.

07:13.893 --> 07:15.827
You are misusing
that term, Greg.

07:15.861 --> 07:17.062
- What?
- Yeah.

07:17.096 --> 07:19.932
"Mano a mano," uh... doesn't
mean man to man.

07:19.966 --> 07:21.267
It means hand to hand.

07:21.301 --> 07:22.668
It's like combat.

07:22.703 --> 07:24.670
But I think what you're
trying to say is man to man

07:24.705 --> 07:26.172
so you're actually using it

07:26.206 --> 07:28.741
in the exact inverse of
what you're trying to say.

07:28.776 --> 07:29.876
- R-Really?
- Yeah.

07:29.910 --> 07:31.144
It's a common mistake.

07:31.179 --> 07:32.212
Fucking consultants.

07:32.247 --> 07:34.381
You guys are
sharp, man.

07:34.416 --> 07:36.150
You are the sharpest
of the sharp.

07:36.184 --> 07:37.551
I'm going to write that down.

07:37.586 --> 07:39.387
I got it.
I got other pens, Greg.

07:39.421 --> 07:41.522
- Let me explain.
- Rolling under... No.

07:41.556 --> 07:43.724
- Nice pen.
- Yeah, I got that as a gift.

07:43.759 --> 07:45.927
Can I be honest with you?
It's weird because

07:45.961 --> 07:47.528
I want to kill you.

07:47.562 --> 07:50.163
But I feel a kinship, you know?
We should hang.

07:50.198 --> 07:53.634
That would be awesome, but
I've got this crazy workload...

07:53.668 --> 07:55.335
Since I've been in
So Cal, in LaLa Land,

07:55.370 --> 07:57.037
I write things down.

07:57.072 --> 07:59.006
- Wow.
- I started meditating.

07:59.041 --> 08:00.542
Kiteboarding. Fuck, right?

08:00.576 --> 08:02.210
Fuck.

08:02.244 --> 08:03.978
Yeah, vroom.

08:05.180 --> 08:06.581
No, that's not me.

08:08.817 --> 08:11.552
Oh, fuck.

08:11.587 --> 08:13.454
Principal Gita.

08:13.489 --> 08:15.857
I have a real great nail
place, it's just down the street.

08:15.891 --> 08:18.259
- I would totally...
- Oh, hi, sweetie.

08:19.295 --> 08:21.430
What the fuck is going on?

08:21.464 --> 08:24.933
You have my son out there
traumatized, Gita.

08:24.968 --> 08:27.136
Can we just dial back
the language, Mr. Kaan?

08:27.170 --> 08:28.937
It's not going
to help your cause.

08:28.972 --> 08:31.540
Okay, what the fuck
is she doing here?

08:31.574 --> 08:35.077
Well, I thought, given the
seriousness of what happened,

08:35.111 --> 08:36.477
both parents
should be present.

08:36.513 --> 08:38.447
Our son's out there
on some bogus

08:38.481 --> 08:40.182
- sexual harassment charges...
- Marty.

08:40.216 --> 08:41.840
...and you're just sitting
here drinking it in.

08:41.841 --> 08:42.583
Hey, Marty, Marty...

08:42.619 --> 08:44.687
- This is your moment, right?
- Marty. Marty?

08:44.721 --> 08:46.422
Mar... just...

08:46.456 --> 08:48.090
just calm down
a little bit.

08:48.124 --> 08:49.925
I think we should
really listen

08:49.960 --> 08:51.960
to what Gita
has to say.

08:51.995 --> 08:53.963
Our son is-is wearing dresses,

08:53.997 --> 08:55.964
and he's attack-kissing
other boys...

08:55.965 --> 08:59.869
What we have here, basically?
It is a failed culture, okay?

08:59.904 --> 09:03.662
It's a broken pedagogical paradigm
in the New Pacific School.

09:03.663 --> 09:07.544
What started out as a system
based on the near-perfect

09:07.578 --> 09:10.013
theosophical teachings of Rudolf
Steiner has now descended.

09:10.048 --> 09:11.714
It's now an outmoded,

09:11.749 --> 09:14.517
anachronistic bastardization--
well, a limitation, really--

09:14.551 --> 09:15.751
of its original intent...

09:15.785 --> 09:17.152
- Mr. Kaan.
- ...really.

09:17.187 --> 09:18.520
- Mr. Kaan!
- Yes?

09:18.555 --> 09:19.855
I have a doctorate

09:19.889 --> 09:21.823
- in education from Stanford.
- Oh, boy.

09:21.858 --> 09:23.892
My first job after my PhD

09:23.926 --> 09:25.593
was as an educational
consultant for DeLoit.

09:25.628 --> 09:27.228
Which is where I met

09:27.262 --> 09:29.897
my ex-husband, a management
consultant very much like you,

09:29.932 --> 09:32.400
who made my life
a living hell,

09:32.434 --> 09:35.069
until I met my dear
life partner Deandra.

09:35.104 --> 09:37.606
So I know the nest of fucking
pit vipers you crawl in.

09:39.409 --> 09:42.111
Well... that came out.

09:42.145 --> 09:45.682
Anyway, my desire is
for the highest good

09:45.716 --> 09:48.618
as it relates to Roscoe, and
as it relates to the school.

09:48.652 --> 09:51.135
In this case, I feel
change makes sense.

09:51.136 --> 09:51.922
Just say it.

09:51.956 --> 09:53.357
You're trying to expel my son.

09:53.391 --> 09:55.026
Let's not think of it
as an expulsion.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.594
What do you want to
think of it as?

09:56.628 --> 09:57.594
Well...
What...?

09:57.629 --> 09:59.196
I mean, is the
other kid, Caleb,

09:59.231 --> 10:01.104
also not being thought
of as an expulsion?

10:01.105 --> 10:01.932
It's complicated.

10:01.966 --> 10:03.801
Is it? Well, let me
unpack it for you.

10:03.835 --> 10:05.636
Here's what's happening:

10:05.671 --> 10:08.539
See, uh, I'm not paying for
your new science lab, okay?

10:08.574 --> 10:10.208
And I'm definitely
not getting the band

10:10.242 --> 10:12.644
together to play your
funky little fundraiser

10:12.678 --> 10:15.814
for the school so Caleb's
daddy, the rock star--

10:15.848 --> 10:19.618
the '90s grunge
big money man donor--

10:19.652 --> 10:22.488
he gets it, he wins.

10:22.522 --> 10:25.157
Right? Great values, Gita.

10:25.192 --> 10:27.159
I hope you're teaching
that to the kids.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.062
Caleb's father is a generous
contributor to the school.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.531
But this is about Roscoe,
and what happened today.

10:31.565 --> 10:33.333
I think we both know

10:33.368 --> 10:34.681
he is trying to work
through some kind--

10:34.682 --> 10:35.802
You know what, this is bullshit.

10:35.837 --> 10:37.504
- This is bullshit!
- Marty...

10:37.538 --> 10:40.339
This is bullshit.

10:40.374 --> 10:43.676
Now, I am headed to
the airport Monday morning.

10:43.710 --> 10:45.244
But before I get there,

10:45.278 --> 10:47.245
I'm dropping my son
off at this school.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.847
I don't think
that's a good idea.

10:48.881 --> 10:50.682
Gita... he is coming to school

10:50.716 --> 10:51.983
- Monday morning.
- Not a good idea.

10:52.018 --> 10:53.852
But I am more than willing
to discuss this

10:53.886 --> 10:55.721
further with the relevant
parties before you leave.

10:55.755 --> 10:57.402
I don't have a lot of
time before I leave.

10:57.403 --> 10:58.590
It's gonna have to be Sunday.

10:58.625 --> 11:01.461
- You good with Sunday at 4:00?
- I can do that.

11:09.704 --> 11:11.973
Wow.

11:12.007 --> 11:14.037
Heard you
really QB'd the shit out

11:14.038 --> 11:15.977
of that Stay Rite
engagement in Salt Lake.

11:16.011 --> 11:18.011
Tough gig, you
brought it home.

11:18.046 --> 11:20.480
It was, and I did.

11:20.515 --> 11:23.717
Mr. Control Freak Marty
Kaan was okay with that?

11:23.751 --> 11:25.751
Uh... more or less.

11:34.226 --> 11:36.594
More, or less...

11:37.830 --> 11:40.298
- Wow.
- What?

11:40.332 --> 11:42.300
Shh, shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh.

11:42.335 --> 11:45.504
It's just uncanny to me, how
much you remind me of my wife.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.140
Well, you know, my...
God... My ex-wife.

11:48.174 --> 11:50.243
Wife/ex-wife/wife/ex-wife...

11:50.277 --> 11:52.812
Yeah, I didn't... um...

11:52.846 --> 11:55.515
I-I know, I know, what could you
possibly say to that, right?

11:55.549 --> 11:57.049
- Right.
- It's a big compliment.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.317
She's very talented.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.886
She's a... formidable person.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.155
That's very kind.

12:03.189 --> 12:04.590
Well, I can be a kind person

12:04.624 --> 12:06.210
some of the time, Jeannie.

12:06.211 --> 12:08.527
And you are deserving
of kindness.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.763
- And respect.
- Thanks very much, Greg.

12:12.432 --> 12:15.233
Hey, listen. Listen.
I'm, um...

12:15.268 --> 12:16.501
I'm new to town.

12:16.535 --> 12:18.437
And I don't know
a lot of people.

12:18.471 --> 12:21.239
I don't know a lot of women.
I do know you.

12:21.274 --> 12:23.875
- Hey, Marty.
- Hey.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.710
Marty...  just
talking to Jeannie about that

12:25.744 --> 12:27.244
Stay Rite engagement

12:27.279 --> 12:29.780
in Salt Lake. She really
tore it up, didn't she?

12:29.814 --> 12:30.268
Almost.

12:30.269 --> 12:32.082
Oh, my God, thanks
so much, Marty!

12:32.116 --> 12:33.417
Well, hey, Marty, you gotta
treasure your team,

12:33.451 --> 12:35.085
treat 'em right. Love 'em up.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.255
Am I right, Jeannie-who-reminds-
me-of-my-wife-who-left-me-

12:37.289 --> 12:38.756
after-Marty's-wife-
made-her-squirt?

12:38.791 --> 12:40.192
- Oh, my.
- Greg...

12:40.226 --> 12:41.526
I've already
apologized for that.

12:41.561 --> 12:42.794
And she wasn't my wife.

12:42.829 --> 12:44.930
Oh, God, that's right.
I remember now.

12:44.965 --> 12:46.932
She was a cheap
bi-curious stripper

12:46.967 --> 12:49.068
who just gutted my life.
Moving on.

12:50.471 --> 12:52.973
Hey, guys. Guys!

12:53.007 --> 12:54.774
Don't go anywhere,
I need you. Stay.

12:54.809 --> 12:56.042
Us two?

12:56.077 --> 12:57.277
Stay.

12:57.311 --> 12:58.778
So, it was fun to catch up.

12:58.813 --> 13:01.047
I'm off to examine
every piece of business

13:01.081 --> 13:02.715
you've done in
the last two years with

13:02.749 --> 13:03.983
an electron microscope.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.385
Wow! Get ready to be
blinded by 1,000 suns!

13:06.419 --> 13:07.986
Oh! Ready!

13:08.021 --> 13:09.254
Ting ting ting!

13:17.431 --> 13:19.399
I knew it was bad, but...

13:19.433 --> 13:21.601
this is bad in a way that
even I couldn't imagine.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.604
Ah, fuck that guy.

13:23.638 --> 13:25.973
So listen... it's
the weekend coming up.

13:26.007 --> 13:27.508
It's a sacred time, really.

13:27.543 --> 13:29.110
- Sure is.
- You know?

13:29.144 --> 13:32.080
A time when we just escape
that hustle and bustle

13:32.114 --> 13:33.771
and kind of just drop
in, find that me time.

13:33.772 --> 13:34.950
A little time for Guggenheim.

13:34.984 --> 13:37.185
Yeah. Well, that's not
going down this weekend.

13:37.219 --> 13:38.853
- No?
- No.

13:38.888 --> 13:40.309
Roscoe is in trouble at school;

13:40.310 --> 13:43.290
he's being unfairly persecuted
and I need to buy some leverage.

13:43.325 --> 13:46.427
So the four of us are gonna
go hard on that little

13:46.461 --> 13:48.362
hippie-haven, find something
to fuck them up.

13:48.396 --> 13:50.497
That's not exactly on the
development matrix, Marty.

13:50.532 --> 13:52.832
I'm asking for
a little help here, Jeannie.

13:52.867 --> 13:56.803
Right, but I have the right
to say thanks but no thanks.

13:56.837 --> 13:57.345
No, you don't.

13:57.346 --> 13:59.305
I don't see you coming to
my house on the weekends,

13:59.339 --> 14:00.640
helping me weed
my vegetable garden.

14:00.674 --> 14:02.775
- Oh! I have an herb garden.
- Oh, yeah?

14:02.810 --> 14:05.892
Jeannie, this is not a vegetable garden;
this is my son we're talking about.

14:05.893 --> 14:08.381
But I... you can handle it.
I'm gonna see you guys Monday.

14:08.415 --> 14:11.017
Really? Just like that?

14:11.051 --> 14:12.451
Apparently.

14:12.486 --> 14:14.487
Well, I'm out then.
I'll see you Monday.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.622
No... What do you guys
want to eat for dinner?

14:16.656 --> 14:19.992
Oh, I'm out. Kind of doing
a cleanse at the moment.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.634
So... talk to me.

14:30.669 --> 14:33.003
- What's your dream cake?
- Dream cake?

14:33.037 --> 14:34.035
Yeah, you know... dream cake.

14:34.036 --> 14:35.239
Every bride's got a dream cake.

14:35.273 --> 14:36.006
Yeah, you know,

14:36.007 --> 14:38.643
the one you've fantasized
about shoving in his face?

14:38.677 --> 14:41.179
Ha.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.183
We, uh...
we talked about that.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.851
- I think, uh, just vanilla.
- We... yeah, just... right.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.486
We could do that.
But might I make a suggestion?

14:47.521 --> 14:49.522
- Sure. Sure.
- Rolled fondant.

14:49.557 --> 14:52.559
It's huge. It's enormous,
it's the thing right now.

14:52.593 --> 14:54.595
Sure. I mean, I'm not
familiar with fondant,

14:54.629 --> 14:56.896
- but it, it looks delicious.
- Great.

14:56.931 --> 14:58.264
So what colors
are we working with?

14:58.299 --> 15:00.232
- Um, colors, we didn't...
- We didn't really have...

15:00.267 --> 15:01.767
have a chance to...
a chance to talk about it.

15:01.802 --> 15:03.002
- Colors.
- Um...

15:03.036 --> 15:06.505
I was just thinking maybe
just cake... color.

15:08.107 --> 15:10.742
Uh, could we take a look at
your book, or do you...

15:10.776 --> 15:12.177
have a book?

15:12.211 --> 15:13.945
Yeah. Feel free.
It's right over there.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.381
- Take your time.
- All right. Cool.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.719
Okay.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.055
- You okay?
- Mm-hmm. Yes.

15:23.089 --> 15:26.926
I love <i>you</i> and all,
I just don't love cake.

15:26.961 --> 15:28.361
Right.

15:28.396 --> 15:31.531
Or <i>vol au vent</i> pastry
with herbed goat cheese.

15:31.565 --> 15:34.601
Or fucking horse-drawn
carriages. Or a wedding.

15:34.635 --> 15:36.203
You're talking to
the right guy.

15:36.237 --> 15:38.071
Okay? Let's just
keep this simple,

15:38.106 --> 15:39.539
and have a kick-ass party.

15:39.574 --> 15:41.308
Okay?

15:41.342 --> 15:43.811
I mean... I guess we have to
have a wedding cake, right?

15:43.845 --> 15:45.379
So let's just
fucking pick one out

15:45.413 --> 15:46.981
- and get out of here.
- Okay.

15:47.015 --> 15:49.917
And we can go do unspeakable
things in the parking lot

15:49.952 --> 15:51.551
- in the car, in
- broad daylight.
- Okay.

15:51.586 --> 15:53.120
Okay?
All right?

15:53.154 --> 15:54.588
- Hi!
- How are you doing?

15:54.623 --> 15:56.056
- Good.
- Oh, my goodness!

15:56.091 --> 15:57.458
Okay. I pulled this

15:57.493 --> 16:01.396
out of a bridal
magazine in Provence.

16:01.431 --> 16:04.065
OMG. I love this cake.

16:04.100 --> 16:06.735
Six-tiered hexagon
almond amaretto cake,

16:06.769 --> 16:09.004
covered in Tiffany blue sugar
flowers and fondant bows,

16:09.038 --> 16:11.506
- for 200 guests.
- Beautiful.

16:11.540 --> 16:13.174
Well, my wife
has great taste.

16:13.209 --> 16:14.976
You just said "wife."

16:15.011 --> 16:16.412
I sure did.

16:18.114 --> 16:20.849
Aw...

16:20.883 --> 16:22.517
Oh, shit...

16:22.552 --> 16:26.121
Fucking Marty Kaan needs me
to come into the office today.

16:26.156 --> 16:26.835
On a Saturday?

16:26.836 --> 16:27.757
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

16:27.791 --> 16:29.759
My God, he has no respect
for your personal life.

16:29.793 --> 16:31.294
Okay, well,
it's my job.

16:31.329 --> 16:33.596
I mean, what's not my job
is to be standing here,

16:33.631 --> 16:35.598
tasting 14 different varieties
of dry cake, you know?

16:35.632 --> 16:37.300
- That's not more important.
- Okay.

16:37.334 --> 16:38.534
Okay. Jesus.

16:38.569 --> 16:41.537
Sorry. I... um...

16:41.572 --> 16:43.406
It's just,
this fucking acquisition,

16:43.440 --> 16:45.007
Marty's freaking out,

16:45.042 --> 16:47.509
and he doesn't have a friend
in the world, so he's afraid

16:47.544 --> 16:49.812
he's gonna be pushed out
by this guy from New York.

16:49.846 --> 16:51.847
Wait, why are you rushing
to take his side right now?

16:51.881 --> 16:53.882
I mean, shouldn't you be playing
some politics at this point?

16:53.917 --> 16:56.251
I... I'm trying to.

16:56.285 --> 16:59.955
All right. Well, uh, hey,
go get 'em, babe, all right?

16:59.990 --> 17:01.190
Okay. Thanks.

17:01.224 --> 17:03.526
Hey. We're still okay, right?

17:03.560 --> 17:05.127
Yeah. We're good.

17:05.162 --> 17:07.564
Good.

17:21.212 --> 17:23.313
Thanks for bringing
me to your office.

17:23.348 --> 17:24.548
I like it.

17:24.582 --> 17:25.848
Very architectural.

17:25.883 --> 17:27.851
Yeah, thanks. Yo!

17:27.886 --> 17:29.019
- Yo, yo!
- Hey, good timing.

17:29.053 --> 17:31.021
- Do you own it?
- No.

17:31.055 --> 17:33.824
But... some of it.
A small part.

17:33.858 --> 17:35.425
You know, there's other
partners, and they own

17:35.460 --> 17:37.495
a lot bigger part of the
business, a lot bigger shares.

17:37.529 --> 17:39.997
Are you going to be a big
partner, with bigger shares?

17:40.032 --> 17:41.232
What do you think?

17:41.267 --> 17:42.500
Definitely big time.

17:42.535 --> 17:44.202
- Yeah, from your lips, man.
- Hey, hey.

17:44.237 --> 17:46.505
What up, little man?

17:46.539 --> 17:47.940
Cold chillin',
Sir Clyde of the North.

17:47.974 --> 17:49.342
Sir Clyde of the North?

17:49.376 --> 17:50.910
Did you hear?

17:50.944 --> 17:52.845
I'm being wrongfully
accused, like Joan of Arc?

17:52.880 --> 17:54.915
We're going with Hurricane
Carter, buddy.

17:54.949 --> 17:56.128
Don't even worry about it,

17:56.129 --> 17:57.850
because you know
we got you, right?

17:57.885 --> 17:58.918
I heard that, dawg.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.986
Come on. Knuckle up,
bro-heem.

18:01.020 --> 18:02.755
Don't black it up.

18:02.789 --> 18:04.022
That's what I'm talking about.

18:04.057 --> 18:06.257
Daddy, you're about
to fall in love with us

18:06.291 --> 18:07.825
for we have
officially found

18:07.860 --> 18:09.326
the creamy center
of the Ho-Ho.

18:09.361 --> 18:10.127
Do tell.

18:11.429 --> 18:12.396
Shit, Roscoe!

18:12.430 --> 18:14.031
Go to the kitchen
or something.

18:14.065 --> 18:16.066
Raid the fridge.
I got some frozen
Snickers in there.

18:16.100 --> 18:18.402
Okay, I'm on it.
Don't eat
all of 'em.

18:18.437 --> 18:19.635
You know he's probably
gonna eat 'em all.

18:19.636 --> 18:20.605
Yes, I know he's gonna 'em all.

18:20.639 --> 18:21.602
What's going on?

18:21.603 --> 18:23.408
Okay, listen. Back in 2009,

18:23.442 --> 18:25.291
National
Standardized Review

18:25.292 --> 18:28.229
was found guilty of orchestrating
widespread cheating

18:28.230 --> 18:30.350
across 20 schools,
private and public.

18:30.384 --> 18:31.351
Okay.

18:31.385 --> 18:34.121
Okay, so New Pacific was one
of the schools mentioned.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.090
- So?
- So, what the NSR

18:36.124 --> 18:38.059
would do was inflate the
schools' test scores

18:38.093 --> 18:40.227
to give the appearance
that they had a greater

18:40.261 --> 18:41.395
success rate than
they actually did.

18:41.430 --> 18:42.229
When was this?

18:42.264 --> 18:43.597
Hold on. NSR's now gone

18:43.632 --> 18:44.932
the way of Milli Vanilli,

18:44.967 --> 18:47.034
but Roscoe's school has
moved on

18:47.069 --> 18:48.903
to an apparently more "credible"
testing source:

18:48.937 --> 18:50.237
the National Testing Board.

18:50.272 --> 18:52.740
However, have a look at the
brochures from '09.

18:52.774 --> 18:54.575
Compare them
with the brochures for 2012.

18:54.609 --> 18:56.109
2009, 2012.

18:56.144 --> 18:58.045
Those look exactly the same.

18:58.079 --> 18:59.914
Because they're identical.

18:59.948 --> 19:02.283
That's right.
New Pacific is
still claiming

19:02.318 --> 19:04.452
fraudulent scores from '09
to bolster their enrollments.

19:04.487 --> 19:06.655
Even though the kids are still
not performing as promised.

19:06.689 --> 19:07.822
That's bad.

19:07.857 --> 19:08.923
That is bad.

19:08.958 --> 19:09.791
That's good.

19:09.825 --> 19:11.326
- Mm-hmm.
- That <i>is</i> good.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.762
So, I can still make
<i>Wicked</i> in time?

19:13.796 --> 19:15.296
I invited my landlady.
I should let her know.

19:15.331 --> 19:16.598
The lady with
a dozen pigeons?

19:16.632 --> 19:18.433
Yeah, they're homing pigeons.

19:18.467 --> 19:21.002
Hey, listen,
we are good.

19:25.874 --> 19:29.176
Thing One and Thing Two
are fast asleep.

19:29.210 --> 19:32.146
Does that mean
we have to be quiet?

20:21.695 --> 20:23.563
- You don't believe him.
- Who?

20:23.597 --> 20:25.265
Roscoe.
You think he did it.

20:25.299 --> 20:26.733
You think he
kissed that boy.

20:26.767 --> 20:29.302
If I don't believe him,
why am I taking on the school?

20:29.336 --> 20:30.637
Why am I fighting so hard?

20:30.671 --> 20:31.838
'Cause that's what you do.

20:31.873 --> 20:34.074
You're a good dad.

20:34.108 --> 20:36.310
- I don't know about that.
- I do.

20:36.344 --> 20:38.112
I had a shitty one.

20:39.581 --> 20:41.149
You're a consultant.

20:41.183 --> 20:44.386
- I am.
- I need a consultation.

20:44.421 --> 20:45.050
Okay, what's up?

20:45.051 --> 20:46.622
You know I love
hanging out with you.

20:46.656 --> 20:50.026
April, don't bullshit me, okay?

20:50.060 --> 20:52.195
I don't want
to play games with you.

20:52.229 --> 20:54.297
Just, just tell me what's up.
Don't soft sell it.

20:57.635 --> 20:59.669
I killed someone.

20:59.703 --> 21:01.738
Okay, maybe you can soft sell it
a little bit.

21:01.772 --> 21:02.560
But it was an accident,

21:02.561 --> 21:04.274
and they're talking about
second-degree murder.

21:04.308 --> 21:06.009
Wait a minute,
are you fucking serious?

21:06.043 --> 21:08.245
You killed somebody?

21:08.279 --> 21:11.181
Baby, uh...

21:11.215 --> 21:14.718
listen, that's, that's

21:14.753 --> 21:17.287
not really my area
of expertise, you know?

21:17.321 --> 21:18.922
There are legal
consultants.

21:18.956 --> 21:20.590
But they gotta do
actual work.

21:20.624 --> 21:22.892
I have consulted
plenty of lawyers, Marty.

21:22.926 --> 21:23.612
I need someone

21:23.613 --> 21:26.062
with a genuinely meta
take on this whole thing.

21:26.096 --> 21:27.263
Someone's who's not constrained

21:27.297 --> 21:28.731
by something as finite
as the law.

21:28.765 --> 21:33.368
Okay, um...
who's the vic?

21:33.402 --> 21:35.136
Off-duty cop.

21:36.705 --> 21:38.873
Oh, fuck!
Fucking cute.

21:38.908 --> 21:41.709
Came over to my apartment,
we had relations,

21:41.744 --> 21:43.779
and she went to get a
drink out of the fridge...

21:43.813 --> 21:45.447
Wait a minute.
Did you say "she"?

21:45.481 --> 21:49.251
Yeah. As you know, I have a soft
spot for cute girls.

21:49.285 --> 21:52.588
Baby, except for
the whole murder thing,

21:52.622 --> 21:54.489
you're the perfect woman.

21:54.524 --> 21:56.792
Anyway, she chugged a bottle
of water filled with GHB.

21:56.826 --> 21:58.260
GHB, the party drug?

21:58.294 --> 21:58.821
Yeah.

21:58.822 --> 22:01.426
What are you doing with a bottle
full of GHB in your fridge?

22:01.427 --> 22:02.564
I'm a 25-year-old
stripper, Marty.

22:02.599 --> 22:04.734
Yeah, true that.

22:04.768 --> 22:06.669
And if I get a second-degree
murder conviction,

22:06.703 --> 22:08.704
I'll be barred
from practicing.

22:08.739 --> 22:11.440
Barred from practicing?
You're gonna be behind bars.

22:11.475 --> 22:15.177
I told her it was, it was marked
clearly, "GHB" in big letters.

22:15.212 --> 22:16.879
You told her and it was marked?

22:16.913 --> 22:17.813
She was a cop.

22:17.848 --> 22:20.282
I am a stripper.

22:20.317 --> 22:22.118
They want blood.

22:23.520 --> 22:25.788
I can't let this
go to trial, Marty.

22:25.822 --> 22:27.523
So I need a sexy motherfucker
like you

22:27.557 --> 22:28.891
to help me work some angles.

22:34.431 --> 22:35.430
Consult.

22:45.574 --> 22:47.508
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

22:47.542 --> 22:49.009
You believe me, right?

22:49.044 --> 22:51.879
Doesn't matter if I believe you.
You're my son.

22:51.913 --> 22:55.983
Dad, do... you... believe me?

22:56.017 --> 22:58.351
100%.

23:04.692 --> 23:07.160
Now let's get these guys.

23:11.532 --> 23:14.801
So as you can no doubt see
from the numbers there,

23:14.835 --> 23:18.238
if this information were
to get out to the press,

23:18.272 --> 23:21.141
well, the New Pacific School
would be in a very,

23:21.175 --> 23:23.176
I don't know,
sticky situation.

23:25.046 --> 23:26.747
Yeah, it just got real, Gita.

23:26.782 --> 23:31.019
Mr. Kaan, Marty, can I speak
really honestly?

23:31.053 --> 23:32.320
I have no idea.

23:32.355 --> 23:35.390
It's not about the school
or any perceived problem

23:35.424 --> 23:36.958
you or anybody
else has with it.

23:36.992 --> 23:38.193
It's about you, Mr. Kaan.

23:38.227 --> 23:39.327
Mmm-mm.

23:39.362 --> 23:41.696
It's about you and
your very sweet son.

23:41.730 --> 23:43.565
And about how you're going

23:43.599 --> 23:46.368
to lose him if you can't plug
into his issues on

23:46.402 --> 23:48.336
a very real and emotional
and substantive level.

23:48.371 --> 23:51.406
You are really talking
out of your ass right now, Gita.

23:51.440 --> 23:55.376
Please, Marty, let's just hear
what she's got to say, okay?

23:55.411 --> 23:56.344
Yeah, come on, Marty.

23:56.379 --> 23:57.512
Well, I've talked

23:57.546 --> 24:00.215
to your father and
ex-wife about how

24:00.249 --> 24:01.950
you lost your own mother
to suicide

24:01.984 --> 24:03.986
at a young age.

24:06.456 --> 24:10.760
See? This is exactly what
I've been trying to say;

24:10.794 --> 24:13.730
that your relationship
with Roscoe

24:13.764 --> 24:15.565
and Annalise's suicide
are the same...

24:15.599 --> 24:17.233
Are you fuckin' kidding me
right now?

24:17.268 --> 24:18.368
Exactly. Marty,
tell her what

24:18.402 --> 24:19.903
your mom used to say to you

24:19.937 --> 24:21.171
when you were little.

24:21.205 --> 24:24.107
Okay, that's it, that's it.

24:24.142 --> 24:25.508
I'm done with this shit.

24:25.542 --> 24:26.776
Just hang in
there, Marty.

24:26.810 --> 24:29.145
No, fuck that! What is this?
Is this an intervention?

24:29.179 --> 24:31.246
Are we here for Roscoe?!
What is this shit?!

24:31.280 --> 24:32.881
Yes?

24:32.915 --> 24:37.152
Sorry, but Caleb wanted
to talk to you guys.

24:37.186 --> 24:39.821
Hey, I told my dad
what happened;

24:39.856 --> 24:44.326
that Roscoe didn't try
to kiss me. I tried to.

24:44.360 --> 24:49.197
And I guess, well,
we're kids, you know?

24:49.232 --> 24:54.537
And my dad said anyway,
David Bowie and Marilyn Manson,

24:54.571 --> 24:56.305
they're both badasses
who get tons of strange...

24:56.339 --> 24:59.742
Thank you, Caleb.
That's very interesting.

24:59.776 --> 25:02.678
I told him no hard feelings.
I mean, I get it.

25:02.712 --> 25:04.947
I have
an irresistible magnetism.

25:04.981 --> 25:06.515
Okay. Go.

25:08.384 --> 25:09.684
He's got a magnetism.

25:09.718 --> 25:11.319
I think he was
wearing my scarf.

25:11.353 --> 25:12.753
It looks good
on him.

25:12.787 --> 25:13.988
You should have
taken that scarf.

25:14.022 --> 25:15.590
Do you think they
really kissed or...?

25:15.624 --> 25:17.258
Probably they did.

25:27.504 --> 25:31.575
I admit the weather's fucking
great, but it's not New York.

25:31.609 --> 25:33.911
No, it is better..

25:33.945 --> 25:36.380
Uhh!

25:38.782 --> 25:39.849
Whoo!

25:39.883 --> 25:41.417
You want to get
out of here?

25:41.452 --> 25:42.585
Let's go.

25:42.619 --> 25:44.120
- Here you go, man.
- Keep it. All right.

25:44.154 --> 25:45.387
Come on.
LA over New York?

25:45.422 --> 25:47.723
Are you high?

25:47.757 --> 25:49.357
Yes, I'm definitely high.

25:50.393 --> 25:51.659
But it's better,
it's better.

25:51.694 --> 25:52.827
It's just a secret.

25:52.861 --> 25:55.496
A secret? Between you
and 11 million people?

25:55.531 --> 25:56.431
My closest friends.

25:57.667 --> 26:00.369
Ah, but you told me.
Does that mean I'm in?

26:00.403 --> 26:04.073
Hey, so I was thinking
about your cop situation.

26:04.107 --> 26:08.778
Was this chick depressed
or-or suicidal even?

26:08.812 --> 26:11.281
And before you answer, listen,
I-I could be subpoenaed.

26:11.315 --> 26:14.184
But I'm just saying
if she was depressed,

26:14.219 --> 26:18.588
and you told her about
the GHB in the fridge and...

26:20.691 --> 26:22.759
- She chugged it.
- Yeah.

26:22.793 --> 26:23.793
Suicide by GHB.

26:23.827 --> 26:26.629
I'm just saying.
Ask your lawyers,

26:26.664 --> 26:29.132
but I think that
constitutes a defense.

26:30.901 --> 26:34.603
Yeah. You have the morals
of a crocodile.

26:34.637 --> 26:36.038
Said the rattlesnake.

26:36.072 --> 26:38.541
I think you may have
just saved my ass.

26:38.575 --> 26:41.244
Glad to do it.

26:41.278 --> 26:44.280
I like that ass.
Now put it in the car.

26:47.251 --> 26:49.252
I probably should have waited
to tell you, though.

26:49.286 --> 26:51.989
If I can get you to stay around a
little bit longer.

26:52.023 --> 26:55.293
- I'm not going anywhere.
- No?

26:55.327 --> 26:56.461
Uh, I am, though.

26:56.495 --> 26:58.330
I got a 4:30 a.m. car.

26:58.364 --> 26:59.531
Where are you going?

26:59.565 --> 27:00.765
Shit, I don't know.

27:00.800 --> 27:03.235
Someplace where they make shit

27:03.269 --> 27:05.871
and they need us to come in
and tell them how

27:05.905 --> 27:08.774
to make that shit better
or faster or cheaper or...

27:08.809 --> 27:11.244
I don't know.

27:11.278 --> 27:13.346
Can I come
watch you pack?

27:13.381 --> 27:14.748
Yeah. Only take
about two minutes.

27:14.782 --> 27:16.583
I got that shit down
to a science.

27:16.617 --> 27:19.519
Sounds like we got
some time left over.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.888
Dirty girl!
