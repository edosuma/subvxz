<i>[Woman] More than</i>
<i>three thousand years ago,</i>

00:42.459 --> 00:46.420
<i>a man named Job complained to God</i>
<i>about all his troubles.</i>

00:47.130 --> 00:50.340
<i>And the Bible tells us</i>
<i>that God answered.</i>

00:51.092 --> 00:53.969
<i>"Do you give the horse his strength?</i>

00:54.054 --> 00:56.597
<i>Or clothe his neck with a flowing mane?</i>

00:57.515 --> 01:00.184
<i>Do you make him leap like a locust,</i>

01:00.268 --> 01:03.145
<i>striking terror with his proud snorting?</i>

01:04.730 --> 01:09.193
<i>He paws fiercely,</i>
<i>rejoicing in his strength</i>

01:09.277 --> 01:11.445
<i>and charges into the fray.</i>

01:11.529 --> 01:14.031
<i>He laughs at fear, afraid of nothing.</i>

01:15.116 --> 01:17.284
<i>He does not shy away from the sword.</i>

01:18.078 --> 01:20.370
<i>The quiver rattles against his side,</i>

01:20.455 --> 01:22.915
<i>along with the flashing spear and lance.</i>

01:23.500 --> 01:26.668
<i>In frenzied excitement</i>
<i>he eats up the ground.</i>

01:27.337 --> 01:30.839
<i>He cannot stand still</i>
<i>when the trumpet sounds."</i>

01:48.817 --> 01:50.943
[Birds chirping]

01:51.027 --> 01:53.862
[Woman] Kate, Sarah,
you have to leave in ten minutes.

01:53.947 --> 01:57.699
[Man] Penny, I have three shirts
to pick up at the cleaners,

01:57.784 --> 02:00.202
and two more to go in the hamper,
if you wouldn't mind.

02:00.286 --> 02:02.621
- I'll pick those up.
- Also go by the wine shop,

02:02.705 --> 02:05.833
pick up some Riesling? I have a client
coming in. That's all he drinks.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.459
[Penny] Sarah, orange juice, please.

02:07.544 --> 02:10.753
- No nuclear devices on the table.
- [Boy] Come on, Dad.

02:10.839 --> 02:12.256
[Girl] Daddy, I need
to pick up a gown.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.799
Another gown?

02:13.883 --> 02:16.593
When you earn your own money,
you can buy gowns for every party.

02:16.678 --> 02:20.347
[Penny] I'm sure we can find something
reasonable. We can go look this weekend.

02:20.431 --> 02:23.308
- Not Gewurztraminer, only Riesling.
- Mom, can we have pancakes?

02:23.393 --> 02:25.853
- Working on it.
- [Girl] Che Guevara or Ho Chi Minh?

02:25.937 --> 02:29.398
- What are you doing?
- Getting ready for a Christmas pageant.

02:29.482 --> 02:32.025
- A Christmas pageant? When?
- Spring.

02:32.110 --> 02:35.821
It's experimental. Has to do
with Christmas and lots of things.

02:35.905 --> 02:38.574
Really? That's great! What's the role?

02:38.658 --> 02:41.952
- The War Protester.
- I was thinking that we could...

02:42.036 --> 02:43.954
- The what?
- The War Protester.

02:44.038 --> 02:45.330
[Telephone ringing]

02:45.415 --> 02:48.417
It's a really good role, Mom.
You'll love it. You, too, Dad.

02:48.501 --> 02:53.505
- Tweedy residence. This is she.
- War protester in a Christmas pageant?

02:59.137 --> 03:01.889
We'll leave this afternoon. Thank you.

03:20.617 --> 03:24.328
[Man] What are you doing? I don't pay
you to dream, I pay you to work.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.873
Now, let's get to it. Come on!
You do that on your own time.

03:29.417 --> 03:33.170
- [Indistinct chatter]
- Thank you.

03:33.254 --> 03:34.504
Oh, Hollis.

03:40.803 --> 03:42.387
Mama's gone.

03:43.848 --> 03:46.808
She's gone. Hi, Jack.

03:46.935 --> 03:51.521
Hollis, I'm so sorry for your loss.
Your mother was always so kind to me.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.445
- Miss Chenery, we're sorry.
- Thank you.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.410
- Penny...
- [Penny sighs]

04:05.495 --> 04:07.955
Penny, darling. Darling.

04:11.626 --> 04:14.253
Girls, you remember Miss Ham?
Granddaddy's secretary?

04:14.337 --> 04:17.589
- Hi, Miss Ham.
- Oh, my, you two have grown.

04:17.673 --> 04:18.757
[Laughter]

04:18.841 --> 04:21.593
Thank you so much, Miss Ham.
For everything.

04:23.888 --> 04:25.764
Hollis said you found her.

04:25.848 --> 04:29.726
She had just fallen.
The doctor said she didn't suffer.

04:29.811 --> 04:33.855
- She looked... peaceful.
- Hm.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.359
How is Daddy?

04:40.488 --> 04:42.322
He keeps asking, "Where is she?"

04:42.407 --> 04:46.451
But I'm not sure if he's asking
for your mother or you.

04:46.536 --> 04:47.703
Hmm.

04:49.539 --> 04:52.708
Girls, I'm going to go in
and see your granddaddy now.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.627
I'll bring you in later.

04:55.712 --> 04:58.630
Come on, girls.
Let's get you something to eat.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.135
[Man] Don't let them fool you, darling.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.224
<i>It's not whether they think we won.</i>

05:09.309 --> 05:11.852
It's whether we think we won.

05:15.231 --> 05:17.566
You run your race, Penny.

05:18.526 --> 05:20.110
[Chuckles]

05:28.411 --> 05:29.494
We'll take 'em.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.999
<i>We just got ourselves</i>
<i>a couple new horses.</i>

05:34.083 --> 05:36.043
<i>[Young Penny]</i>
<i>Are we going to race them?</i>

05:36.127 --> 05:37.586
<i>[Man laughs] No.</i>

05:37.670 --> 05:40.839
They're going to be mommies
and daddies for new horses.

05:46.554 --> 05:47.554
Helen?

05:48.931 --> 05:51.892
Daddy, it's Penny.

05:53.853 --> 05:55.103
Penny.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.357
You got married.

05:59.734 --> 06:00.859
Yes.

06:04.113 --> 06:05.739
But I'm here now.

06:08.493 --> 06:12.079
Because Mama's gone.

06:25.676 --> 06:27.135
Mama's pin?

06:29.972 --> 06:31.681
Yours now.

06:36.813 --> 06:37.896
Daddy.

06:37.980 --> 06:41.942
<i>[Man] The Lord shall preserve</i>
<i>thy going out, and thy coming in.</i>

06:42.026 --> 06:43.735
<i>From this time forth...</i>

06:44.529 --> 06:46.571
...and even forever more.

06:46.656 --> 06:51.076
And so we return to You
your faithful servant, Helen Chenery.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.537
Loving mother, devoted wife...

06:54.330 --> 06:56.998
...who lived each moment
to the fullest,

06:57.083 --> 07:00.127
cherishing the life she had
with her beloved husband, Christopher.

07:00.211 --> 07:03.255
And may the peace
that passeth all understanding

07:03.339 --> 07:06.716
be in your hearts now and forever more.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.927
- Amen.
- [All] Amen.

07:10.012 --> 07:12.347
[Thunder rumbles]

07:13.766 --> 07:18.270
Eddie? Eddie, I just wanted
to thank you so much for coming.

07:18.980 --> 07:23.859
Miss Penny, your mama was a fine woman.
I just feel real bad for Mr. Chenery.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.069
[Penny] He always thought
the world of you.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.572
He said you could hear the horses'
thoughts through your hands.

07:29.699 --> 07:33.076
Yeah, well, your father's a good man,
Miss Penny.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.202
Thank you.

07:36.914 --> 07:38.623
Mrs. Tweedy?

07:39.709 --> 07:41.293
I'm Arthur Hancock.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.086
- Your daddy called me...
- Bull!

07:43.171 --> 07:45.422
Oh, yes, and everyone else did,
too, as I recall.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.299
This is my son, Seth.

07:47.383 --> 07:49.718
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Thank you for coming.

07:49.802 --> 07:53.388
Your mother was a fine woman.
It was a privilege just knowing her.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.556
Thank you.

07:54.682 --> 07:57.142
I know you're going
to be making some changes,

07:57.226 --> 08:01.271
and if you or your family have any
questions, Miss Ham's got my number.

08:01.355 --> 08:02.564
Thank you, Bull.

08:05.902 --> 08:06.902
Ma'am...

08:08.488 --> 08:11.948
Your daddy's eyes would always light up
when he talked about you.

08:13.034 --> 08:16.578
How smart you are.
How much you loved the horses.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.544
[Thunder rumbles]

08:26.589 --> 08:28.798
<i>[Hollis] Doctor says there</i>
<i>may be some brief moments</i>

08:28.883 --> 08:31.843
<i>when he is aware ofthings,</i>
<i>but we shouldn't expect much.</i>

08:31.928 --> 08:35.847
Practical thing would be
to put him in a nursing home.

08:35.932 --> 08:41.019
This is home to him.
And he knows he's here.

08:41.102 --> 08:45.482
I think as long as he does, we should
hire nurses and let him stay at home.

08:45.566 --> 08:49.861
[Laughs] The farm has to go.
And it won't bring much.

08:49.946 --> 08:54.241
It's been losing money
hand over fist for years now.

08:54.325 --> 08:58.662
We have to face facts.
To run a horse breeding operation,

08:58.746 --> 09:00.539
you need a certain touch.

09:00.623 --> 09:03.208
I'm a professor, and you're a housewife.

09:04.293 --> 09:07.629
I moved up our flight to first thing
tomorrow. I've got to get back.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.674
Jack, I need a few more days here.

09:10.758 --> 09:16.137
I have to make sure Daddy's all right,
sort through Mother's things.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.682
The kids could all do
with a little responsibility.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.225
It will just be a few days.

09:20.309 --> 09:24.521
We need to file right away
for his power of attorney?

09:24.605 --> 09:27.941
Miss Ham says he tried to sell
four of his best horses last month

09:28.025 --> 09:33.613
for half ofwhat they're worth. Mom had
to step in and stop him, and now...

09:33.698 --> 09:36.324
I suppose someone will have to
clean up for the liquidation.

09:37.660 --> 09:41.830
Hollis, if you need any help
on the tax issues you call me, anytime.

09:43.165 --> 09:45.375
Thanks, Jack.
It will just be for a few days.

09:46.836 --> 09:49.713
- [Horse whinnies]
- [Children laughing]

09:49.797 --> 09:51.923
Sarah makes great pancakes.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.217
- Oh, no!
- They're toxic. We won't survive.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.927
That's right, you won't.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.555
Make sure Hollis has
that power of attorney order.

09:59.348 --> 10:01.891
- The estate's vulnerable.
- I will. I'll stay on him.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.103
Mom, give Granddaddy a hug for us
when he wakes up.

10:05.187 --> 10:08.023
- I will. I love you!
- [Children] Love you!

10:08.107 --> 10:09.733
- [Children] Bye, Mom!
- Be good!

10:09.817 --> 10:10.859
[Kate] We will!

10:26.334 --> 10:31.630
- [Horse neighing]
- Miss Ham. Thank you.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.673
Two sugars and cream?

10:33.758 --> 10:34.883
How did you know?

10:34.967 --> 10:38.136
- It's how your daddy likes it.
- Oh.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.097
You doing all right, honey?

10:41.932 --> 10:43.058
Yes.

10:45.353 --> 10:48.313
No. But I'll be all right.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.944
These two are both pregnant
by Bold Ruler.

10:57.657 --> 11:01.201
And great colts come from great sires.

11:04.246 --> 11:05.288
Miss Ham?

11:06.791 --> 11:08.917
My mother thought the world of you.

11:09.001 --> 11:14.047
And my father's trust in you was...
is absolute.

11:14.131 --> 11:15.965
I hope you'll stay.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.678
Funny, I was about
to tell you the same thing.

11:19.762 --> 11:22.180
[Man] Al! Who the hell told you
to bring this one out?

11:22.264 --> 11:24.683
The sable, put it back.
Bring out the yearling in 18.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.477
- [Al] Yes, sir, Mister Jansen.
- Who are you?

11:28.771 --> 11:30.855
Penny Tweedy.

11:30.940 --> 11:34.067
- Penny Chenery.
- Oh, you're the daughter.

11:34.819 --> 11:39.781
- Better get back to work.
- Excuse me, Mr. Jansen?

11:40.866 --> 11:43.284
Could I talk with you a moment?
In private?

11:43.369 --> 11:45.286
Oh.

11:46.414 --> 11:50.041
- About what?
- I wanted to ask you about that sale

11:50.126 --> 11:52.460
of those broodmares that
my mother stopped a few weeks ago.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.755
I know you and your brother aren't
horse people and you suffered a loss,

11:55.840 --> 11:59.217
but you don't need
to worry about this right now.

11:59.301 --> 12:00.385
Apparently, I do

12:00.469 --> 12:03.555
since they're my father's horses,
and the sale would've been bad business.

12:03.639 --> 12:06.057
It's bad business to come to a barn,
interrupt a trainer's work.

12:06.142 --> 12:09.269
- Not if you want to keep him.
- I understand.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.897
- But about that sale?
- What about it?

12:12.982 --> 12:15.900
They were worth twice
what we were going to sell them for.

12:15.985 --> 12:18.194
I couldn't sleep last night,
so I checked the books

12:18.279 --> 12:20.280
and I made some calls this morning
to be sure.

12:20.364 --> 12:24.367
Like you say, I don't own the horses.
Your father has to sell them.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.745
But as trainer,
you would know their worth

12:26.829 --> 12:29.289
and that they were about to be sold.

12:29.373 --> 12:33.126
I'm wondering why it had to be my mother
who stopped the sale and not you.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.962
The old man, your father? Ask him.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.966
I'm asking you! My father's been sick
for quite a long time now.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.885
You've been paid
to look out for his interests.

12:41.969 --> 12:45.180
And I do! Just because this place
is going downhill it ain't my fault.

12:46.974 --> 12:49.267
The sale was going to be
to Oakworth Farms?

12:49.351 --> 12:53.021
I learned this morning that the owners
of Oakworth were already talking

12:53.105 --> 12:55.857
about selling our horses for twice
the price they were going to pay us.

12:56.692 --> 12:59.527
- You train for them, too, don't you?
- I don't have an exclusive deal here.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.321
I work for them sometimes. So what?

13:01.405 --> 13:03.072
So if you arranged a deal

13:03.157 --> 13:06.034
that gave them four horses
at half their market value

13:06.118 --> 13:09.579
and they paid you back, plus an extra
share on everything they made,

13:09.663 --> 13:12.665
that wouldn'tjust be disloyal.
That would be committing fraud.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.835
Who the hell do you think you are?
Coming here, accusing me?

13:16.545 --> 13:19.047
Someone who knows enough law
to know she's right.

13:19.131 --> 13:23.760
And I'm not "missy" anything.
Get your things and get off my farm!

13:23.844 --> 13:27.096
I have a contract, and I'll sue you.

13:27.181 --> 13:31.142
If I ever even hear your name again,
I will see that you go to prison!

13:33.354 --> 13:36.147
- [Car engine starts]
- [Tires squealing on gravel]

13:37.983 --> 13:39.859
Where does Bull Hancock eat lunch?

13:41.487 --> 13:43.363
At his club, every day.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.158
But it's gentlemen only.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.292
[Indistinct chatter]

13:59.421 --> 14:03.925
[Woman] Uh, miss?
Uh... Miss, you can't...

14:04.009 --> 14:06.386
I'm sorry, Mr. Hancock.

14:06.470 --> 14:09.430
I told her this was a gentleman's club,
and she just...

14:09.515 --> 14:11.516
It's all right, Brenda. It's all right.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.436
Thank you, Seth.
I apologize for interrupting.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.522
It's fine. I have friends here,
Miss Chenery.

14:17.606 --> 14:18.606
Thank you.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.610
Well, how's it going?

14:24.238 --> 14:25.947
I fired Earl Jansen.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.157
Do tell.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.911
Does that mean you're selling the horses
or keeping them?

14:32.913 --> 14:35.456
The farm's in bad shape, as is Daddy.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.543
But I'm not willing to sell it
unless I get what it's worth.

14:40.254 --> 14:43.882
Well, horse farm needs
a strong hand on the reins,

14:43.966 --> 14:48.511
but the hand that threw Earl Jansen out
the door looks pretty strong to me.

14:48.596 --> 14:52.098
Well, I've got a family back in Denver.

14:53.475 --> 14:56.185
I need a good trainer
just to get things stabilized.

15:00.482 --> 15:05.820
You need to talk to Lucien Laurin.
He's a French Canadian.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.489
Dresses like SuperFly.

15:09.241 --> 15:10.909
He's trying to retire.

15:12.536 --> 15:13.995
What do you mean, "trying"?

15:15.831 --> 15:17.624
[Faint indistinct chatter]

15:20.836 --> 15:22.170
[Grunts]

15:36.393 --> 15:37.685
Mr. Laurin?

15:38.646 --> 15:42.732
Excuse me. I'm Penny Chenery,
Chris Chenery's daughter.

15:42.816 --> 15:46.861
And, um, I need a trainer. Bull Hancock
suggested that I find you...

15:46.946 --> 15:48.780
Yeah, Bull called me, but I tell you,

15:48.864 --> 15:52.241
I'm tired of babysitting half-ton
animals who are nearly as stubborn

15:52.326 --> 15:54.535
and stupid as their owners are.

15:55.496 --> 15:59.040
I've lost interest in racing.
Don't even follow it anymore.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.211
Well, I'm in a bit of a tight spot.

16:03.295 --> 16:07.298
I wonder if you mightjust try it

16:07.383 --> 16:10.468
- for a few months and see how...
- I don't need to try anything,

16:10.552 --> 16:13.554
and trainers don't go anywhere
to work for a few months.

16:13.639 --> 16:17.725
- They go where there is a good horse.
- We have plenty of good horses.

16:17.810 --> 16:22.563
No, you don't. You have one or two
that might be worth the time,

16:23.315 --> 16:27.402
but you're a little short on people over
there who know what they're doing.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.780
Well, that's why I've
come to see you, Mr. Laurin.

16:30.864 --> 16:34.575
Miss, you're not hearing me. A trainer
makes his living off commissions.

16:34.660 --> 16:38.371
Ten percent off sales,
ten percent offwinners.

16:38.455 --> 16:41.082
To get a top trainer,
you need a top horse.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.627
You're going to have to go back to Bull
and see if he has any other ideas.

16:45.462 --> 16:48.589
Mr. Laurin, two of our mares
are pregnant by Bold Ruler

16:48.674 --> 16:50.842
who is the finest stallion
of his generation.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.427
- Fore!
- [Man] Hey!

16:52.553 --> 16:55.388
- Fore!
- [Man] Watch where you're hitting!

16:55.472 --> 16:59.684
Well, I yelled "fore," you idiot.
That's what "fore" means.

17:03.772 --> 17:06.482
You see how I am, Miss Chenery,
when I put myself

17:06.567 --> 17:08.776
in a position to do something poorly?

17:09.486 --> 17:14.281
And I'm afraid at your stable,
I'd be yelling "fore" all day long.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.626
Give my regards to your father.

17:45.856 --> 17:47.356
Fore!

18:14.802 --> 18:16.052
[Whinnies]

18:37.658 --> 18:39.408
<i>- [Jack] When are you coming back?</i>
<i>- [Penny] Soon.</i>

18:39.493 --> 18:41.619
<i>I need to talk to you</i>
<i>about this coin toss thing.</i>

18:41.703 --> 18:44.122
<i>- [Jack] Coin toss?</i>
<i>- [Penny] Jack, listen.</i>

18:44.206 --> 18:48.376
<i>Stallions cost more than mares.</i>
<i>No, they're more glamorous.</i>

18:48.460 --> 18:50.336
<i>But Daddy knew that a great horse</i>

18:50.420 --> 18:52.839
<i>comes just as much</i>
<i>from the mare as the stallion.</i>

18:52.923 --> 18:56.008
<i>He invested in mares,</i>
<i>which is the first smart thing he did.</i>

18:56.093 --> 19:00.138
<i>Second smart thing he did</i>
<i>was he made a deal with Ogden Phipps.</i>

19:00.222 --> 19:02.723
<i>[Jack] Phipps? Richest man in America?</i>

19:02.891 --> 19:05.685
<i>[Penny] Yes.</i>
<i>Instead of paying a stud fee,</i>

19:05.769 --> 19:09.939
<i>Daddy made a deal to breed Phipps'</i>
<i>best stallion with our two best mares.</i>

19:10.065 --> 19:14.735
<i>When the mares are close to term, they</i>
<i>toss a coin to see who gets which foal.</i>

19:17.030 --> 19:19.240
That coin toss is in two weeks!

19:19.324 --> 19:22.702
What's the difference? I don't have
any idea which horse to choose.

19:22.786 --> 19:27.623
I've been through the stud books, Jack.
Bold Ruler, that's the sire.

19:27.708 --> 19:31.085
He was fast,
but he couldn't last over distances.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.255
Now the two dams are
Hasty Matilda and Somethingroyal.

19:34.339 --> 19:37.633
Hasty Matilda is eight years old.
She's still young.

19:37.718 --> 19:41.179
<i>Since broodmares tend to produce their</i>
<i>best offspring while they're young,</i>

19:41.263 --> 19:44.765
<i>that makes herfoal the obvious choice,</i>
<i>since Somethingroyal's 17.</i>

19:44.850 --> 19:47.602
But her grandsire was Princequillo.

19:48.937 --> 19:50.188
He had great stamina, Jack.

19:50.272 --> 19:52.190
- Penny? Penny!
- Do you know what that means?

19:52.274 --> 19:55.443
- What?
<i>- [Jack] Sire and dam and Sam-l-Am?</i>

19:55.527 --> 19:59.488
What is this?
Come on. We need you here, Penny.

19:59.573 --> 20:00.823
<i>Come home.</i>

20:03.076 --> 20:04.619
Right after the coin toss.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.292
[Line goes dead]

20:16.215 --> 20:18.549
- You about ready?
- We're ready.

20:18.634 --> 20:20.384
- Excuse me just a minute.
- Mmm-hmm

20:26.683 --> 20:29.852
I'll be making the toss.
Are you waiting on anybody else?

20:29.937 --> 20:33.981
- No, I came alone.
- We toss right on the hour.

20:34.691 --> 20:36.317
- Good luck to you.
- Thank you.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.113
Hi. Good to see you, Mr. Hancock.
How are you?

20:41.198 --> 20:42.740
Hollis. What are you doing here?

20:42.824 --> 20:46.994
I called Jack about our tax issues,
and he told me you fired our trainer.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.455
How do you expect we can
fetch a good price on the farm

20:49.539 --> 20:51.999
ifwe don't have
a training operation in place.

20:52.084 --> 20:57.129
He was dishonest. He had to go.
You came down here because of a trainer?

20:57.214 --> 21:00.883
This coin toss is big.
The foal could be worth a great deal.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.551
I checked with some of Phipps' people.

21:02.636 --> 21:05.429
They think he wants
Hasty Matilda's foal.

21:05.514 --> 21:06.973
So that's who we'll choose.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.891
No, Hollis, I think that's wrong.

21:08.976 --> 21:12.603
Somethingroyal's colt could have an
unusual mix of speed and stamina.

21:12.688 --> 21:16.399
Phipps has the best horse people in
the world. You know more than they do?

21:17.859 --> 21:19.193
Come on.

21:24.574 --> 21:26.534
Please don't take offense, Miss Chenery,

21:26.618 --> 21:30.705
but your father almost never
won our coin tosses.

21:30.789 --> 21:33.124
And I do hope you've inherited his luck.

21:34.209 --> 21:36.210
All right. We're all here now.

21:36.962 --> 21:39.755
Mr. Phipps has the call
as the owner of Bold Ruler.

21:39.840 --> 21:44.010
The winner has the choice of the
offspring of Mr. Chenery's mares.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.971
Hasty Matilda or Somethingroyal.

21:47.055 --> 21:51.058
Are we all in agreement here?
All right. Here we go.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.476
- Call.
- [Ogden] Heads.

22:02.029 --> 22:05.364
Heads it is. I'll go with Hasty Matilda.

22:07.075 --> 22:10.369
Miss Chenery.
Please give my best to your father.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.665
Well, that's that.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.167
But I got what I wanted.

22:20.088 --> 22:24.467
You got what nobody else wanted.
Time to go home.

22:28.513 --> 22:29.889
Can I give you a lift home?

22:29.973 --> 22:31.807
No, thank you,
I have Daddy's truck here.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.851
- All right.
- Bye, Bull.

22:41.276 --> 22:43.110
So, who won the coin toss?

22:44.112 --> 22:47.448
Phipps. He went with Hasty Matilda.

22:47.532 --> 22:49.283
Of course he did.

22:51.244 --> 22:53.871
Call me when
she's ready to drop her foal.

23:04.466 --> 23:07.843
Pigs! Pigs. They're all such pigs!

23:08.387 --> 23:10.429
We've been putting on
this Protest Pageant for a year.

23:10.514 --> 23:12.890
Now the teacher says it's too political
and we can't put it on.

23:12.974 --> 23:14.725
What do you mean you can't?

23:14.810 --> 23:17.144
They have a rule that theater projects
can't be political.

23:17.229 --> 23:20.564
When the teacher saw what we were
doing... Dad, can we, like, sue them?

23:20.649 --> 23:25.069
If you didn't disclose until today, they
couldn't be held liable for a breach.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.488
- What?
- [Telephone rings]

23:29.074 --> 23:31.992
Honey, listen. If this is really
important to you, you won't...

23:32.077 --> 23:33.869
- Tweedy residence.
<i>- [Man] Is Miss Chenery there?</i>

23:33.954 --> 23:36.747
- Can we talk about this some more?
- Yeah. OK. Fine.

23:36.832 --> 23:39.333
Penny. For Miss Chenery.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.256
- This is Penny.
<i>- This is Eddie.</i>

23:45.340 --> 23:48.050
<i>Somethingroyal is about</i>
<i>to drop her foal.</i>

23:49.219 --> 23:52.346
- All right. Thank you.
<i>- Bye, Miss Chenery.</i>

24:01.106 --> 24:02.982
Somethingroyal's foal is on its way.

24:11.199 --> 24:15.411
Kick hard! Come on! Kick, Chris!
Come on. Good job!

24:16.913 --> 24:22.209
Hey, John. How would you like to come
with me and see a horse being born?

24:23.044 --> 24:24.545
- Really?
- Yeah!

24:25.297 --> 24:26.672
- OK.
- [Laughs]

24:31.261 --> 24:32.928
[Horse grunting]

24:34.097 --> 24:36.056
How many times has she done this?

24:36.600 --> 24:38.893
She did it 13 times.

24:39.561 --> 24:41.187
You've done it four.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.190
Yes.

24:51.948 --> 24:53.240
[Horse groans]

25:00.874 --> 25:04.251
- [Colt whinnies]
- It's a boy. It's a boy.

25:05.921 --> 25:06.962
[Penny sighs]

25:16.640 --> 25:20.184
- Have you ever seen that?
- No. Not me.

25:20.268 --> 25:22.978
- What?
- A colt stand up that fast.

25:23.563 --> 25:25.898
[Speaks French]

25:37.661 --> 25:39.245
[Colt whinnies]

26:00.767 --> 26:03.727
Hey, Daddy. I brought you some company.

26:07.482 --> 26:09.483
This is the Bold Ruler colt, Daddy.

26:16.741 --> 26:18.367
We call him Big Red.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.764
Let him run his race, darling.

26:50.358 --> 26:55.237
<i>[Man over PA] Flight 226 to Denver</i>
<i>is ready for boarding. Gate 33-D.</i>

27:12.505 --> 27:17.092
- [Penny] Almost done.
- [Jack] I know this is hard for you.

27:17.177 --> 27:19.803
How long do you think you can
keep living two lives at once?

27:21.556 --> 27:24.933
The yearlings are looking good,
especially the red one.

27:25.018 --> 27:27.061
We've cut expenses.

27:27.604 --> 27:29.563
We're breaking even.

27:31.733 --> 27:35.778
I thought the point was to sell
the farm, not to break even.

27:38.073 --> 27:42.493
[Penny] When I went off to college,
I felt like that colt.

27:42.577 --> 27:44.411
Full of promise.

27:44.496 --> 27:48.207
Full of adventure, like I could...

27:50.543 --> 27:52.127
...make something work.

27:52.212 --> 27:54.797
I gave up a career
to have our family, and...

27:55.799 --> 27:59.218
...this colt is part of our family now.

28:00.387 --> 28:01.887
I just want to see him run.

28:01.971 --> 28:05.265
So after two years
ofjuggling all this...

28:06.768 --> 28:11.230
...it isn't ending,
it's just... beginning?

28:31.668 --> 28:35.921
- [Lucien] How's he feel, Jimmy?
- Just a big kid having fun out there.

28:36.005 --> 28:39.133
He'll figure it out. Huh, Red?

28:40.176 --> 28:42.219
[Lucien] That's good. That's good.

28:42.303 --> 28:47.725
Now, listen, don't try
to change his natural gait, OK?

28:47.809 --> 28:49.435
Don't force him.

28:57.152 --> 28:59.319
[Penny] Well, Mr. Laurin,
what do you think?

28:59.404 --> 29:02.448
[Laurin] I think he's 1100 pounds
of baby fat.

29:02.532 --> 29:04.158
He eats too much and too often.

29:04.242 --> 29:07.703
The only reason he doesn't eat more
is because he's too busy sleeping.

29:07.787 --> 29:12.708
He only does what he wants to do
exactly when he wants to do it.

29:13.042 --> 29:16.837
He lays against the back
of that starting gate

29:16.921 --> 29:19.840
like he's in a hammock in the Caribbean.

29:20.717 --> 29:23.635
And when he finally does
get out of the gate,

29:23.720 --> 29:26.472
it takes him forever to find his stride.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.808
Any other questions?

29:29.893 --> 29:33.103
I have one. How much
did you spend on that hat?

29:33.646 --> 29:35.939
Right now this horse
is all sleep and eat.

29:36.024 --> 29:39.109
But he's got fire inside him.
Ain't that right, Red?

29:39.194 --> 29:43.113
That horse couldn't beat a fat man
encased in cement

29:43.198 --> 29:45.824
being drugged backwards
by a freight train.

29:45.909 --> 29:48.410
Well, you should know, Mr. Laurin.

29:48.495 --> 29:49.953
- Mm-hmm.
- [Big Red snorts]

29:50.038 --> 29:51.830
You thought that was funny. I did, too.

29:51.915 --> 29:54.666
I wish we could just race him
under his name. Red.

29:54.959 --> 29:57.461
The Jockey Club insists on unique names.

29:57.545 --> 29:59.797
I keep sending them,
they keep rejecting them.

29:59.881 --> 30:02.800
I've tried Something Special,
Royal Line, Deo Volente...

30:02.884 --> 30:04.301
Deo Volente. "God willing."

30:04.385 --> 30:07.095
God may have been willing,
but The Jockey Club wasn't.

30:07.180 --> 30:12.434
Well, there is a race up in Aqueduct
in a couple weeks.

30:12.519 --> 30:16.563
I think we should send him out.
It's time. Not that I'm expecting much.

30:17.357 --> 30:18.649
Let's enter him, then.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.318
Deo Volente.

30:21.402 --> 30:24.029
- [Jack] Well, that was really good!
- [Boys] Can we be excused?

30:24.113 --> 30:25.239
Sure.

30:26.157 --> 30:28.575
- Please bring in the dessert.
- OK, Mom.

30:29.244 --> 30:31.036
It's good you're home.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.539
Your daughters have something
they want to talk to you about.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.874
Oh? What's that?

30:36.584 --> 30:40.671
Kate and I were thinking of going
to Chile. Just for a couple of months.

30:41.756 --> 30:44.758
Chile? What for?

30:45.593 --> 30:47.010
[Stammers]

30:47.095 --> 30:50.097
Teach English and learn Spanish.
It's part of a cultural mission.

30:50.181 --> 30:55.018
A mission to stir up trouble and act
cool, you mean? Chile is socialist now.

30:55.103 --> 30:56.270
- Thank you.
- Go play.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.522
It is not.
And that's not why we're going.

30:58.606 --> 31:01.650
Although if an opportunity to
protest the war did present itself...

31:01.734 --> 31:03.068
See? This is what you're missing.

31:03.152 --> 31:05.863
Your teenage daughters
are growing up to become rebels.

31:05.947 --> 31:07.364
No, more like hippies. Free spirits.

Ronnie.

45:41.572 --> 45:44.782
- Arnold Palmers for everyone!
- [Penny] Oh, big spender.

45:46.827 --> 45:49.036
- Congratulations.
- Mmm!

45:49.121 --> 45:50.913
- Great riding, Ronnie.
- Good job.

45:54.752 --> 45:56.419
- Look at this.
- [Man] Hey, Ronnie.

45:56.503 --> 45:57.962
- Good job, man.
- Thank you, man.

45:59.339 --> 46:02.258
To the greatest horse I ever rode.

46:02.342 --> 46:06.554
And to its owner, who took on
the old boys and won.

46:06.638 --> 46:08.431
But now that you've
gotten their attention,

46:08.515 --> 46:10.767
you're going to have to take them on
in earnest next year.

46:10.851 --> 46:13.436
- The races are longer.
- Much longer.

46:13.520 --> 46:15.646
- The horses are faster.
- Much faster.

46:15.731 --> 46:18.274
And every owner, every trainer,
every jockey out there

46:18.358 --> 46:20.568
is going to be trying to bring us down.

46:22.362 --> 46:24.697
- I'll be ready.
<i>- Salut.</i>

46:28.535 --> 46:31.871
[Penny] Horse of the Year!
We have to celebrate.

46:32.539 --> 46:35.500
Is this the article that's going to be
running across the country?

46:35.626 --> 46:37.502
Did you hear?

46:37.586 --> 46:39.378
It's your daddy, honey.

46:39.963 --> 46:41.798
He's had a stroke.

46:45.886 --> 46:47.428
Let's just go.

46:52.726 --> 46:56.354
I don't think there's much left unsaid
between us, Daddy.

46:58.899 --> 47:01.359
I always knew where you stood.

47:06.657 --> 47:10.743
And I'm grateful... so grateful,

47:10.828 --> 47:13.371
for the way you showed me

47:13.455 --> 47:15.832
what it was to stand up
in the world and...

47:17.417 --> 47:19.418
...live the way you believe.

47:29.429 --> 47:33.307
The big red colt
won Horse of the Year, Daddy.

47:35.435 --> 47:37.603
I think he can go all the way.

47:39.481 --> 47:41.274
And if he does...

47:42.526 --> 47:46.821
I hope...

47:53.537 --> 47:55.580
I hope you could see it.

48:11.597 --> 48:12.930
[Sobs]

48:17.769 --> 48:19.645
[Door opening]

48:26.278 --> 48:29.822
Jack, what are you doing here?
How did you get here so fast?

48:29.907 --> 48:31.324
I'm so sorry about your father.

48:32.659 --> 48:33.993
I was already on my way.

48:34.828 --> 48:37.830
Already? Are the children all right?

48:37.915 --> 48:41.334
They're fine. I left Denver
before I heard the news.

48:42.294 --> 48:44.712
Hollis had asked me
to study the tax issues

48:44.796 --> 48:47.048
that would arise
upon your father's death.

48:47.132 --> 48:51.344
Issues that now
find us totally unprepared.

48:51.428 --> 48:54.639
So you've asked my husband
to become your ally in this?

48:54.723 --> 48:56.515
It's family business.

48:56.683 --> 49:01.979
And, last time I checked, Jack and your
children were still part of this family.

49:02.064 --> 49:05.650
Hollis, you're my brother
and I love you,

49:05.734 --> 49:08.486
but if you presume to judge
my fitness as a wife or mother

49:08.570 --> 49:10.613
I will count you a stranger
for the rest of my life.

49:10.697 --> 49:12.698
Penny, Hollis is only
trying to talk sense.

49:12.783 --> 49:15.326
We need to regain some perspective.

49:15.410 --> 49:18.329
- Regain?
- Penny, it's just...

49:18.413 --> 49:20.790
Let's not talk about this right now.

49:23.502 --> 49:26.837
No. No, no, no.
She needs to hear this.

49:26.922 --> 49:28.422
She needs to hear what?

49:28.507 --> 49:30.967
At the current value of his estate,

49:31.051 --> 49:34.595
the inheritance tax will be
at least six million dollars.

49:34.680 --> 49:37.932
And neither of us
has a fraction of that money.

49:39.810 --> 49:41.978
So we sell the mares and the yearlings.

49:42.062 --> 49:46.941
I had an appraisal done, and that won't
get us half ofwhat we need.

49:47.025 --> 49:50.069
But there is another option.

49:50.737 --> 49:52.238
I'm not selling him.

49:52.322 --> 49:54.782
Due to his outstanding
two-year-old season,

49:54.866 --> 49:59.787
if he were sold today, Secretariat would
bring a price of seven million dollars.

49:59.871 --> 50:02.248
But if he were to lose
just one of the Triple Crown races

50:02.332 --> 50:05.418
that value would drop to three million
with no way to recover it.

50:05.502 --> 50:07.294
So we sell Secretariat.

50:07.379 --> 50:09.547
- You try and sell him and...
- [Hollis] We're out of time.

50:09.631 --> 50:12.842
Lfwe don't play this right,
it could amount to nothing.

50:12.926 --> 50:15.344
Our father came from nothing.

50:15.429 --> 50:18.055
And his legacy to me isn't money.

50:18.140 --> 50:22.309
It's the will to win! If you can.
And live with it if you can't.

50:22.394 --> 50:27.189
If I have to challenge you
in court on this, I will.

50:30.652 --> 50:34.530
Miss Ham? Would you come in here
a moment, please?

50:39.578 --> 50:41.328
[Penny] Thank you, Miss Ham.

50:41.413 --> 50:45.624
Would you tell Jack and Hollis about
the document that Daddy left for you.

50:50.505 --> 50:54.800
Five years ago Mr. Chenery had me
witness him signing a provision that,

50:55.719 --> 50:58.095
while both of you are beneficiaries,

50:58.180 --> 51:01.515
dispersal of the farm
would be left to Hollis.

51:01.600 --> 51:04.143
Decisions regarding the horses
would be left to Penny.

51:08.690 --> 51:11.525
We could argue he already had dementia.

51:11.610 --> 51:14.945
He was of sound mind when he signed it.

51:15.030 --> 51:18.991
I'd swear to it... in court.

51:21.161 --> 51:22.620
Thank you, Miss Ham.

51:26.792 --> 51:28.959
[Hollis] Great.
I teach economics at Harvard,

51:29.044 --> 51:32.171
and I don't know a way
to conjure up six million dollars

51:32.255 --> 51:35.508
before you race him again.
What makes you think you can?

51:36.676 --> 51:40.930
I'll find a way.
And if I can't, I'll live with it.

51:41.014 --> 51:45.101
Why? Why do you need to live with it?

51:45.185 --> 51:50.606
Make me, the whole family,
live with it for a past that is gone!

51:51.775 --> 51:55.444
Our father was a great man,
but we can't bring him back.

51:55.529 --> 51:57.363
This isn't about going back.

51:57.447 --> 52:01.450
This is about life being ahead of you
and you run at it.

52:01.535 --> 52:04.995
Because you never know how far
you can go unless you run.

52:06.623 --> 52:07.873
That's great.

52:11.711 --> 52:13.587
But if you stumble and fall,

52:13.713 --> 52:17.675
you don'tjust make us fools,
you make us beggars.

52:19.219 --> 52:20.553
[Door opens]

52:21.555 --> 52:24.390
When your horse people call the house,
they don't ask for Mrs. Tweedy,

52:24.474 --> 52:26.475
they ask for Miss Chenery.

52:26.560 --> 52:30.146
- Is that who you've become?
- Jack...

52:31.731 --> 52:35.985
...Miss Chenery and Mrs. Tweedy
have always been the same person.

52:36.069 --> 52:40.698
I'm wondering how it is that Mr. Tweedy
could take sides against me.

52:49.249 --> 52:50.583
[Door closes]

52:55.839 --> 52:59.049
Trying to muscle me into something.
Can't do that.

52:59.134 --> 53:01.802
- Good evening, Eddie.
- Hi, ma'am.

53:05.974 --> 53:07.850
How are you, Big Red?

53:08.894 --> 53:11.520
- How's it going?
- [Eddie] Ma'am...

53:11.605 --> 53:14.857
I reckon you heard about
Bull Hancock, ma'am?

53:16.234 --> 53:17.484
No.

53:20.113 --> 53:21.530
Well...

53:23.825 --> 53:29.205
After your daddy's funeral, they say
he went home and just fell dead.

53:31.875 --> 53:34.793
[Sighs] Oh.

53:39.883 --> 53:42.051
I don't know
about the ways of God, ma'am,

53:42.135 --> 53:46.889
but... I know your daddy
and Mr. Bull lifted each other up.

53:46.973 --> 53:50.893
The way you lift me up
and the way you lift up Red.

53:50.977 --> 53:52.895
Everything living lives from its heart,

53:52.979 --> 53:55.898
and I wish I can give you something
to lift yours up.

53:58.401 --> 54:01.695
Well, thank you, Eddie. You just did.

54:11.748 --> 54:13.332
What does he see?

54:14.834 --> 54:19.004
When he looks at me,
I feel like he looks right into me.

54:20.382 --> 54:24.301
He sees what matters to him, ma'am.
What's immediate.

54:25.011 --> 54:28.597
The clouds and stuff,
they don't mean nothing to a horse.

54:28.682 --> 54:32.601
Lights, sounds, flashes... Intentions!

54:32.686 --> 54:35.271
That's what a horse notices.

54:35.355 --> 54:37.690
Especially one as smart as Big Red here.

54:39.025 --> 54:41.402
And they can tell when the horse
next to them or behind them

54:41.486 --> 54:45.114
wants to be first to the food.
Or the mare.

54:45.198 --> 54:47.283
Or the finish line.

54:47.367 --> 54:50.911
That's what matters to them.

54:51.955 --> 54:53.205
Ain't that right?

55:01.506 --> 55:04.883
It's never been done.
But that doesn't mean it won't work.

55:06.428 --> 55:09.763
We offer 32 shareholders
exclusive breeding rights.

55:10.515 --> 55:12.766
We call it "a select opportunity."

55:13.893 --> 55:16.312
Father would've loved that phrase.
How much per?

55:17.397 --> 55:18.897
190,000.

55:21.234 --> 55:22.735
A hundred and ninety?

55:23.820 --> 55:25.321
Mm-hmm.

55:25.405 --> 55:28.991
That's more than anybody's ever paid
for a breeding share. Lot more.

55:29.826 --> 55:34.163
That's what makes it exciting, Seth.
Horseracing's all about excitement.

55:38.084 --> 55:42.421
He's been a great colt, but he's
completely untried as a three-year-old.

55:42.756 --> 55:46.925
And the sons of Bold Ruler, they're long
on speed, but short on stamina.

55:47.010 --> 55:50.179
Yeah, and his mother was old when she
had him and Ogden Phipps knew all that

55:50.263 --> 55:52.222
when he could have chosen my colt.

55:52.307 --> 55:55.726
But he didn't.
And now I've got Secretariat.

55:55.810 --> 55:58.645
And he's got a horse
named Missed Opportunity.

55:58.730 --> 56:01.023
Daddy used to always say
that rich people are rich

56:01.107 --> 56:02.983
because they're smart with their money.

56:03.068 --> 56:05.444
And they're going to insist
on a performance clause.

56:06.363 --> 56:10.199
No son of Bold Ruler has ever won
a single Triple Crown race.

56:10.283 --> 56:12.576
That's a mile-and-a-half distance

56:12.660 --> 56:14.495
that Secretariat's never
come close to running.

56:14.579 --> 56:18.040
You're going to lose the farm
and the horse, everything.

56:19.292 --> 56:20.250
[Horse whinnies]

56:20.335 --> 56:24.129
[Seth] This is a big deal. I have
never done anything like this before.

56:24.214 --> 56:25.881
Nobody has.

56:28.093 --> 56:31.470
- You mind if I ask why you called me?
- Well...

56:32.806 --> 56:35.933
Your father, he really helped me and...

56:37.310 --> 56:38.894
...and work is good for grief.

56:42.607 --> 56:44.066
I'm in.

56:46.152 --> 56:49.071
Howard Keck on line one,
Bunker Hunt on line two.

56:49.155 --> 56:51.824
Ladies and gentlemen,
start your engines!

56:51.908 --> 56:53.117
[Clears throat]

56:53.201 --> 56:56.495
- Mr. Hunt? Penny Chenery.
- Mr. Keck, Seth Hancock.

56:56.621 --> 56:58.956
I was calling about
a select opportunity on Secretariat.

56:59.040 --> 57:01.834
<i>[Laughs] No, sir, he's not for sale.</i>

57:01.918 --> 57:06.046
<i>No, we are moving</i>
<i>to syndicate his breeding rights.</i>

57:06.131 --> 57:08.340
It's a select opportunity.
We have 32 shares...

57:08.425 --> 57:11.135
<i>Yes, sir. It's a great opportunity.</i>

57:11.219 --> 57:14.263
I will head that way. I'll see you
in a bit. All right, bye-bye.

57:14.347 --> 57:16.640
[Mr. Keck] Look, Seth, I've been
a part of lots of these deals,

57:16.724 --> 57:20.227
but I've never been asked to pay
190 grand for a breeding share.

57:20.311 --> 57:21.728
Nobody has.

57:22.480 --> 57:25.441
Tell Mr. Chenery's little girl
that she's priced this colt

57:25.567 --> 57:27.484
like he's already won the Triple Crown.

57:27.569 --> 57:32.698
I'm calling on behalf of Penny Chenery.
We will call him back later. Thank you.

57:33.366 --> 57:36.785
[Growls] Dr. Todd, please.
It's Elizabeth Ham.

57:36.870 --> 57:39.455
<i>[Penny] No disrespect, sir,</i>
<i>but if he gets any better,</i>

57:39.539 --> 57:40.706
<i>you're going to want to be in on this.</i>

57:40.790 --> 57:44.585
All due respect, but I got a pretty good
handle on where I want to be.

57:44.669 --> 57:46.795
[Penny] You could have her give me
a call me later this afternoon.

57:46.880 --> 57:49.214
[Seth] Yes, Mr. Cleaver, it's lots of
money. But my father used to tell me

57:49.299 --> 57:51.049
you got to spend money to make it.

57:51.134 --> 57:52.634
[Mr. Cleaver] I'll put some thought
into it, all righty.

57:52.719 --> 57:53.719
[Seth] Thank you, sir.

57:53.803 --> 57:58.932
Jock Whitney's a "no."
And Mr. Mellon's on line two.

58:01.853 --> 58:03.937
Mr. Mellon, thank you
for getting back to me.

58:06.608 --> 58:08.734
Of course, I understand, Mr. Mellon.

58:09.611 --> 58:14.698
I'll hold a share for you
in case you reconsider. Thank you.

58:54.822 --> 58:57.407
[Gospel music plays]

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:35.631
<i>[Lucien] Have you ever seen that?</i>

01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:39.384
<i>[Eddie] No, not me. That boy a whopper.</i>

01:00:55.401 --> 01:00:58.403
I don't care how many times they say no.

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:04.576
I don't care how many times they tell us
we can't do it. I am not giving up!

01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:09.498
I will not live
the rest of my life in regret!

01:01:09.624 --> 01:01:13.126
We are going to
see that horse run and win!

01:01:14.712 --> 01:01:18.590
And we are going to live rejoicing!
Every day!

01:01:20.593 --> 01:01:21.843
Amen.

01:01:36.442 --> 01:01:38.360
[Indistinct chatter]

01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:42.864
- Ronnie! Going to have some lunch?
- Mrs. Tweedy.

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:45.992
Yes, ma'am. Just getting a bite to eat
before I go to the ring. What about you?

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:48.870
I'm meeting somebody.
Hello, Mr. Phipps,

01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:50.664
- Thank you for coming.
- Miss Tweedy. My pleasure.

01:01:50.748 --> 01:01:53.333
- You know Ronnie Turcotte, my rider?
- Ronnie.

01:01:53.418 --> 01:01:55.168
So, they call you "Tiny"?

01:01:56.129 --> 01:01:58.422
- What?
- [Laughs] Mr. Phipps...

01:02:03.469 --> 01:02:05.887
- Thank you for coming.
- Sure.

01:02:08.182 --> 01:02:09.558
Are we ready yet?

01:02:09.642 --> 01:02:11.476
We're still thinking about it.

01:02:13.187 --> 01:02:15.480
If I smell the air correctly,
Mrs. Tweedy,

01:02:15.648 --> 01:02:18.150
you're about to ask me
to spend a small fortune

01:02:18.818 --> 01:02:21.778
to buy a share in a horse
I could've owned for nothing.

01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:24.740
That's true, I am.

01:02:24.824 --> 01:02:27.159
Nobody's buying yet, are they?

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:30.746
That's right. They need
someone to lead them.

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:35.792
You know that horse I chose
the day we flipped the coin?

01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:38.712
She's the prettiest,
best-tempered horse in my whole stable.

01:02:39.964 --> 01:02:41.882
And she couldn't outrun my accountants.

01:02:42.508 --> 01:02:45.510
So now you've got the Horse of the Year,
and I look foolish.

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:49.181
It's not foolish
to be unlucky, Mr. Phipps.

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:52.726
Most men, if they had chosen wrong
and lost this horse

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:55.645
wouldn't think of investing in him
again, but you're bigger than that.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:57.773
And if you do invest in him

01:02:57.857 --> 01:03:00.776
instead of being the man who lost
Secretariat in the past,

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:04.488
you'll be the one who had the vision
to lead investors in his future.

01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:10.118
His future is uncertain. And I don't buy
shares in untested three-year-olds.

01:03:10.203 --> 01:03:13.038
But my accountants,

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:16.166
they may be slow afoot,
but they are quick to calculate

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:18.752
and they tell me
that you're in a rough spot.

01:03:18.836 --> 01:03:21.546
So I'll buy
that horse of yours right now.

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:24.216
Seven million dollars. All cash.

01:03:27.011 --> 01:03:30.514
I can't do that.

01:03:30.598 --> 01:03:35.602
If he does what I think he'll do,
his value will double, if not triple.

01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:41.691
You do know what you're saying.

01:03:41.776 --> 01:03:44.736
You're guaranteeing that this horse
is going to win the Triple Crown.

01:03:45.738 --> 01:03:47.948
The Derby, the Preakness
and the Belmont.

01:03:48.032 --> 01:03:51.660
Three races, three states
in just five weeks.

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:54.746
Hasn't been done in 25 years.

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:57.958
There are a lot of good horsemen
think it can't be done anymore.

01:03:58.876 --> 01:04:01.211
Just understand,
this is what you're saying.

01:04:01.295 --> 01:04:03.338
That is exactly what I'm saying.

01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:11.096
Eight million.

01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:15.350
No.

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:19.729
You're that stubborn?

01:04:20.273 --> 01:04:21.940
I'm that right.

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:25.902
Have we made up our mind yet?

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.281
Yes, I think we have.

01:04:45.756 --> 01:04:49.551
<i>All this talk about Secretariat.</i>
<i>He hasn't faced a horse as good as Sham.</i>

01:04:49.635 --> 01:04:52.804
<i>My horse is faster and stronger. We're</i>
<i>not waiting for the Derby to prove it.</i>

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:54.723
<i>We're going to the Wood Memorial.</i>

01:04:54.807 --> 01:04:58.018
<i>And when Secretariat has to run as far</i>
<i>as my horse did today</i>

01:04:58.102 --> 01:05:00.312
<i>he's going to fade like the sunset.</i>

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:03.064
<i>- I guarantee it.</i>
- [Miss Ham] He is ridiculous.

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:05.275
- [Penny groans]
- [Both chuckle]

01:05:05.359 --> 01:05:07.819
Well, Seth, what do you make of that?

01:05:08.654 --> 01:05:11.364
I think that fellow is going to make
Lucien say things in French

01:05:11.449 --> 01:05:12.824
my mama would spank him for.

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:16.786
This guy will not shut his face!

01:05:16.871 --> 01:05:21.833
"Lucien Laurin cannot
train a winning horse."

01:05:21.918 --> 01:05:26.713
OK, so he's saying that I'm incompetent.
He never shuts up.

01:05:26.797 --> 01:05:30.759
This guy, he couldn't
train a flea to jump.

01:05:30.843 --> 01:05:35.096
He couldn't train a monkey
to pick at his own butt.

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:37.933
- Step out here with me.
- He could not train...

01:05:38.017 --> 01:05:40.977
The guy couldn't train
his own bowel movements.

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:45.357
The Wood is in New York.
You're going to need a new dress.

01:05:45.691 --> 01:05:50.028
They say, "Secretariat's owner
is striking and charismatic."

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:51.446
[Phone ringing]

01:05:52.156 --> 01:05:55.158
- Penny Tweedy.
<i>- [Jack] I saw the paper.</i>

01:05:55.242 --> 01:06:01.164
- Yes. Didn't Seth do a greatjob?
- I'd like to say congratulations,

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:05.669
but I am a lawyer, and I know
what performance guarantees mean.

01:06:05.753 --> 01:06:10.173
[Sighs] Jack, I don't know how to
earn a reward without taking a risk.

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:15.095
Is it really true Ogden Phipps
offered you eight million dollars?

01:06:16.389 --> 01:06:19.975
It's true. He wouldn't
have made that offer

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:22.686
unless he thought Secretariat
would be worth twice that.

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:27.357
The richest man in the world
can take a risk like that, Penny.

01:06:28.067 --> 01:06:30.151
<i>- But I can't.</i>
- You?

01:06:30.277 --> 01:06:32.654
I just mean, do what you want
with your money.

01:06:32.738 --> 01:06:35.907
<i>But I can't spend</i>
<i>my money on a risk like that.</i>

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:40.996
Don't worry. I understand.
Not a cent of your money.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.873
I didn't mean it like that.
I just meant...

01:06:43.958 --> 01:06:46.167
I understood how you meant it, Jack.

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:48.920
Let's talk later.

01:06:55.761 --> 01:06:58.263
There are words ofwisdom
that have sustained me

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:00.432
throughout my darkest times.

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:03.184
If you don't mind,
I'd like to share them with you.

01:07:03.269 --> 01:07:04.978
I'm all ears, Miss Ham.

01:07:05.062 --> 01:07:08.857
They are:
"Good evening, Kmart shoppers."

01:07:08.941 --> 01:07:09.858

[Miss Ham] There he is.

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:23.455
[Lucien] Edward, it's big enough
for a Clydesdale!

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:28.084
It ain't big enough for Red. Maybe
he's still hiding fat from the winter.

01:07:29.128 --> 01:07:32.797
Does he look fat to you? [speaks French]

01:07:36.218 --> 01:07:37.302
What are you doing?

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:41.139
The same thing I've done
with every belt I ever owned.

You OK, Miss Ham?

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:07.999
I hate what she's having to go through,
and there's so little I can do to help.

01:08:09.043 --> 01:08:11.753
Someday I'd like to be able to do
for that horse

01:08:11.837 --> 01:08:13.838
half ofwhat you do for its owner.

01:08:15.341 --> 01:08:20.511

And you? How could you hold him back
that long? What were you thinking?

I didn't hold him back.
I rode him the same way I always do.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.585
The only reason Sham didn't
beat us worse is because

his jockey couldn't believe what
was happening! He was waiting for you.

01:12:24.798 --> 01:12:29.552

Well, if it's not the horse

what happened today

- A day?

01:31:15.761 --> 01:31:18.054
Whoo! All right!

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:23.560
We won! I knew you could do it, Mom!

01:31:30.359 --> 01:31:32.068
[Lucien] Congratulations.

01:31:32.403 --> 01:31:35.030
- I can't believe it!
- You did it!

01:31:38.701 --> 01:31:43.330
Penny, it's been 25 years since
horseracing's had a Triple Crown winner.

01:31:43.414 --> 01:31:46.124
Now, is this the horse that finally
breaks that streak?

01:31:46.209 --> 01:31:47.834
We still have a lot ofwork to do.

01:31:47.919 --> 01:31:50.128
But at least we've
given ourselves the chance.

01:31:50.213 --> 01:31:54.341
Congratulations, Penny and Secretariat
on the fastest Derby ever!

01:31:54.425 --> 01:31:58.887
Here's hoping we see the same thing
two weeks from now at the Preakness.

[Jack] Girls!
The race is about to start!

01:32:08.814 --> 01:32:11.191
<i>[Man on TV] The excitement</i>
<i>over this super-horse has captured</i>

01:32:11.275 --> 01:32:12.901
<i>the imaginations of Americans</i>

<i>as we look at him in his barn.</i>

- I can't believe that's Mom!

01:32:42.974 --> 01:32:46.851
- Wow. She looks awesome.
- [Boy 1] I can't believe she's on TV.

01:32:46.936 --> 01:32:49.563

01:33:02.118 --> 01:33:05.996

<i>On the outside, Ecole Etage.</i>

<i>has good position, third on the rail,</i>

<i>and Secretariat is last, again,</i>
<i>as they move...</i>

01:33:13.129 --> 01:33:17.382
- Red's last.
- He's last. Why is he always last?

01:33:18.342 --> 01:33:22.762
<i>But here comes Secretariat! He's moving</i>
<i>fast! And he's going to the outside...</i>

01:33:22.847 --> 01:33:25.682
<i>He's going for the lead,</i>
<i>and it is right now he's looking for it!</i>

01:33:25.766 --> 01:33:28.059
- See him right there?
- All right, Red.

01:33:28.144 --> 01:33:29.686
- Come on.
- Yes.

01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:33.106

<i>Sham now going to the outside in third.</i>
<i>We're moving down the backstretch.</i>

01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:46.828
They're incredible! Look at them!

01:33:46.912 --> 01:33:48.872
<i>Secretariat the leader by...</i>

01:33:48.956 --> 01:33:50.915
- Dad, you seeing this?
- I see him.

01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:54.544
<i>And it looks like Ecole Etage</i>
<i>has had it, dropping back in third.</i>

01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:57.672
<i>Here's the race, folks.</i>
<i>Secretariat trying to hold it.</i>

01:33:57.757 --> 01:33:59.424
Look at this!

01:33:59.508 --> 01:34:02.135
<i>Head of the stretch,</i>
<i>Secretariat at two and a half.</i>

01:34:02.219 --> 01:34:04.721
<i>- Sham under a strong left-handed whip.</i>
- [All cheering]

01:34:04.805 --> 01:34:08.058
<i>Secretariat by two lengths!</i>
<i>Sham driving second!</i>

01:34:08.142 --> 01:34:12.312
<i>It is Secretariat! He's coming to the</i>
<i>wire! He wins it by two and a half,</i>

01:34:12.396 --> 01:34:14.022
<i>almost three!</i>

01:34:14.649 --> 01:34:16.149
I don't believe this!

01:34:19.528 --> 01:34:23.907
<i>And it was a powerhouse race again</i>
<i>by the big, strong Secretariat.</i>

01:34:23.991 --> 01:34:26.785
<i>Here is Mrs. Tweedy, who has just won</i>

01:34:26.869 --> 01:34:29.663
<i>the second of two</i>
<i>very important races to her.</i>

01:34:29.747 --> 01:34:33.208
<i>Secretariat has now won the Kentucky</i>
<i>Derby and the Preakness Stakes,</i>

01:34:33.334 --> 01:34:35.960
<i>and this time he did it the same way.</i>

01:34:40.216 --> 01:34:42.509
What is it, Lucien? What's wrong?

01:34:42.593 --> 01:34:43.885
Nothing.

01:34:45.596 --> 01:34:49.140
He just won Preakness,
like he won the Derby.

01:34:49.225 --> 01:34:52.394
You keep staring into your coffee.
Are you worried about Red?

01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:56.481
Since Citation did it in 1948,

01:34:56.565 --> 01:34:59.234
seven horses have won the Derby
and then the Preakness.

01:34:59.318 --> 01:35:03.154
Every single one of them has failed
to win the Triple Crown.

01:35:03.239 --> 01:35:05.699
He just won the first two
in record time.

01:35:05.783 --> 01:35:08.952
Yeah, and the Belmont
is the graveyard of speed horses.

01:35:09.036 --> 01:35:11.204
It's the longest race they'll ever run.

01:35:12.998 --> 01:35:14.416
What do you suggest?

01:35:16.252 --> 01:35:18.002
Normally we rest him, right?

01:35:18.087 --> 01:35:20.296
- Yeah. Sure.
- Let him recuperate.

01:35:21.465 --> 01:35:22.966
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:25.635
But you don't want to back off.

01:35:26.637 --> 01:35:28.513
In all my years of training

01:35:28.597 --> 01:35:31.474
I've never had a horse who loves to run
the way this one does.

01:35:31.559 --> 01:35:34.853
You take that horse out one day,
he's going to run faster the next.

01:35:34.937 --> 01:35:36.104
My instinct?

01:35:37.064 --> 01:35:41.025
My instinct is to train him.
Hard. To stoke that fire.

01:35:41.110 --> 01:35:45.280
But if I'm wrong, then they will say

01:35:45.364 --> 01:35:49.576
that not only did we ruin the
horse's chances at the Triple Crown...

01:35:50.453 --> 01:35:52.662
...they may say we ruined the horse.

01:35:54.123 --> 01:35:58.251
Red is not afraid. And neither am I.

01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:03.173
Just remember,
ifwe push him instead of rest him...

01:36:04.592 --> 01:36:06.468
...it could be dangerous.

01:36:06.552 --> 01:36:09.179
Nobody knows how much he can take.

01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:13.141
He does.

01:36:14.643 --> 01:36:16.269
He knows.

01:36:16.687 --> 01:36:18.897
[Reporters clamoring]

01:36:18.981 --> 01:36:21.941
[Man] Mr. Martin! Secretariat has beaten
your horse twice.

01:36:22.026 --> 01:36:23.276
What makes this race different?

01:36:23.819 --> 01:36:28.782
Any good horseman will tell you
that Secretariat is built for speed

01:36:28.866 --> 01:36:31.117
and Sham is built for distance.

01:36:31.202 --> 01:36:33.870
But, of course, uh,
Miss Tweedy believes that her horse

01:36:33.954 --> 01:36:36.790
has somehow magically inherited both.

01:36:36.874 --> 01:36:39.292
I believe that this race
is going to prove

01:36:39.376 --> 01:36:42.837
that her woman's intuition
will only take her so far.

01:36:42.922 --> 01:36:46.049
Penny! What about all the attention
Secretariat's getting?

01:36:46.133 --> 01:36:49.135
- Covers of both Time and Newsweek.
- Well...

01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:53.306
Let me tell you something about
all this talk about "super-horse."

01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:55.850
Sham broke the Derby record, too.

01:36:55.935 --> 01:37:00.897
He ran the second-fastest Derby. He ran
the second-fastest Preakness... ever.

01:37:01.398 --> 01:37:04.651
We were right there with the red horse
every step of the way.

01:37:04.735 --> 01:37:08.863
And now we're getting ready to run
the longest of the Triple Crown races.

01:37:08.948 --> 01:37:11.866
When we're done,
you'll be calling Sham the super-horse!

01:37:11.951 --> 01:37:13.326
Any comment, Penny?

01:37:13.410 --> 01:37:16.371
Well, I'd have to say
I agree completely with Mr. Martin.

01:37:16.455 --> 01:37:19.290
His horse did run
the second-fastest ever.

01:37:19.375 --> 01:37:21.084
[Reporters laughing]

01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:24.671
I'm out of here.

01:37:24.755 --> 01:37:27.924
Where are you going? Come on!

01:37:31.595 --> 01:37:35.306
That woman, she's so arrogant. [panting]

01:37:35.391 --> 01:37:39.769
Lucien will do anything to prove he's
not a loser. That's where they're weak.

01:37:39.895 --> 01:37:42.272
We rest our horse, they push theirs.

01:37:42.356 --> 01:37:44.983
On race day, we push him even harder.
We push him until he comes apart!

01:37:48.904 --> 01:37:51.614
Three-quarters of a mile:
1:12 and a fifth.

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:53.408
Oh, that's good time.

01:37:55.369 --> 01:37:57.537
Sure you want to send him
a mile next time out?

01:38:00.332 --> 01:38:01.833
- I'm just asking.
- [Exhales]

01:38:05.129 --> 01:38:07.130
They think we're training him too hard.

01:38:13.637 --> 01:38:14.512
Hmm.

01:38:17.016 --> 01:38:18.850
[Thunder crashes]

01:38:25.357 --> 01:38:27.984

welcome to the Belmont Ball.

[Down-tempo music plays]

01:38:46.003 --> 01:38:47.629
It's not bad.

01:38:47.713 --> 01:38:48.922
[Miss Ham] Your daddy
would be so proud.

01:38:49.673 --> 01:38:50.924
Where did you find her?

01:38:51.008 --> 01:38:53.801
Told her I was taller
when I stood on my wallet.

01:38:57.723 --> 01:38:59.015
Miss Chenery.

01:38:59.099 --> 01:39:02.727
Mr. Laurin. You look exceptionally
handsome tonight.

01:39:02.811 --> 01:39:06.773
Well, I wanted to go on record,
I left my hat at home, just for you.

01:39:06.857 --> 01:39:08.650
- [Chuckles]
- [Both speak French]

01:39:12.029 --> 01:39:16.574
I brought you a little something
from a mutual friend of ours.

01:39:16.659 --> 01:39:22.664
I offered to give it back to Seth,
but he too thought you should have it.

01:39:25.584 --> 01:39:27.919
The "tails" side is very nice.

01:39:30.172 --> 01:39:33.049
Lucien, you know you are absolutely

01:39:33.217 --> 01:39:36.469
the best trainer
that I could have ever...

01:39:37.012 --> 01:39:39.055
You're the best owner I ever saw.

01:39:40.724 --> 01:39:46.020
Turcotte and Edward say he's
the smartest horse they've ever seen.

01:39:46.146 --> 01:39:49.065
Maybe. I've trained horses
my whole life.

01:39:49.149 --> 01:39:53.236
I still don't have the slightest idea
what they know and what they don't know.

01:39:53.946 --> 01:39:58.658
Three years ago I would've said that a
racehorse didn't care who his owner was.

01:39:58.742 --> 01:40:00.576
But then he's not a racehorse.

01:40:01.787 --> 01:40:03.204
He's Secretariat.

01:40:05.916 --> 01:40:09.877
And I think tomorrow
he'll be wearing wings.

01:41:02.806 --> 01:41:04.057
Missed you.

- You're amazing.
- Look at what I've got.

01:41:07.603 --> 01:41:09.270
- Is that the coin?
- The coin?

01:41:09.605 --> 01:41:12.190
- The coin.
- Oh.

01:41:12.274 --> 01:41:14.067
Here. Go ahead. You can hold it.

01:41:14.193 --> 01:41:17.945

Don't lose it tonight. It's important.

Kate is so beautiful in that gown.
And Sarah in hers.

01:41:34.963 --> 01:41:37.882
Yeah. Wish I'd bought
those gowns earlier.

Something I need you to know.

01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:46.015
I want you to win. And win or lose,

01:41:46.141 --> 01:41:48.643
you've taught our children
what a real woman is.

01:41:48.727 --> 01:41:52.021
What it is to believe in yourself, and I
never could have taught those things.

01:41:52.689 --> 01:41:54.857
And you've taught me something, too.

Come here.
