WEBVTT

00:28.166 --> 00:29.583
Yo, Joe! Come on, man!

00:29.667 --> 00:31.500
'You're gonna make me late!'

00:31.583 --> 00:33.458
Yo, mom, I'm
going out with Derek!

00:42.750 --> 00:44.125
Man, you gonna go and
get me killed, man.

00:44.208 --> 00:45.834
I mean, damn, why you always
gotta wear that thing?

00:45.917 --> 00:47.917
Hey, Della says any man
who works at her place

00:48.000 --> 00:49.625
gotta respect
themself
and wear a tie.

00:49.709 --> 00:50.917
Oh, you want
some respect?

00:51.000 --> 00:52.125
You and me cruising
in an Escalade.

00:52.208 --> 00:53.375
That's what I'm
talkin' about.

00:53.458 --> 00:54.625
Man, how you gonna
get an Escalade

00:54.709 --> 00:55.750
when you gotta beg Della

00:55.834 --> 00:57.083
for a free
dinner
every night?

00:57.166 --> 00:58.625
All that'll change
when we take over this hood.

00:58.709 --> 00:59.792
See, once we
running things

00:59.875 --> 01:02.333
she'll be pouring Cristal
in that place.

01:04.792 --> 01:06.125
Yo, Derek.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.250
I thought you said
you gonna get clean.

01:11.333 --> 01:14.750
I am. This,
man..
It's no thing.

01:19.041 --> 01:21.750
Just walk like you
own the block.

01:26.667 --> 01:28.709
Della! You got trouble.

01:31.917 --> 01:33.667
If I'm not back
in 60 seconds, Tom

01:33.750 --> 01:35.166
call the police.

01:37.959 --> 01:40.250
Glad I ain't on the
receiving end of
that.

01:45.625 --> 01:48.792
I always say my wife
is like a force of nature.

01:48.875 --> 01:50.375
Except with most
forces of nature

01:50.458 --> 01:53.458
folks usually get a warning
so they can take shelter.

01:55.166 --> 01:57.333
Behave yourself with that.
Come on, now.

01:57.417 --> 01:59.333
Is Derek in trouble?

01:59.417 --> 02:01.500
Della's breakin' it up.

02:03.333 --> 02:04.834
Get yourself an apron.

02:04.917 --> 02:06.875
Uh, can Joe get
a chicken basket?

02:06.959 --> 02:08.500
Joe can have a job
if he wants.

02:08.583 --> 02:11.542
Oh, no thanks, but some
extra fries'd be good.

02:11.625 --> 02:12.834
What happened out there?

02:12.917 --> 02:14.709
Oh, it ain't no
nothing
I can't handle.

02:14.792 --> 02:15.875
You think
those dishes might up

02:15.959 --> 02:17.166
and bus themselves, Derek?

02:17.250 --> 02:19.333
No, ma'am.
Here I go.

03:11.500 --> 03:12.750
Doyle give you
a hard time?

03:12.834 --> 03:14.417
No, you gotta
buckle
your chin strap

03:14.500 --> 03:16.500
when she gets you
on the stand.

03:16.583 --> 03:17.625
Walking back to PPD?

03:17.709 --> 03:19.083
Vera's
testifying
at the prelim

03:19.166 --> 03:21.667
on the Chicken and Ribs job
from a year ago.

03:21.750 --> 03:22.917
The triple?

03:23.000 --> 03:24.291
That started
out
being my job.

03:24.375 --> 03:26.291
Yeah, the fugitives finally
picked up the shooter.

03:26.375 --> 03:28.917
Been hiding out
at his grandma's for a year.

03:29.041 --> 03:31.041
Well, you knew
Della
and Tom, right?

03:31.125 --> 03:32.083
Over 40 years.

03:32.166 --> 03:33.875
Their girl Nora
is my goddaughter.

03:33.959 --> 03:35.041
Thank you, Detective Vera

03:35.125 --> 03:36.417
and what did you find

03:36.500 --> 03:38.041
when you searched
the home of Squeak Minter

03:38.125 --> 03:39.458
the day after the murders?

03:39.542 --> 03:40.500
(Vera)
'A key to the restaurant'

03:40.583 --> 03:42.125
where the shooting took place.

03:42.208 --> 03:45.125
'Twelve hundred dollars cash,
and a .38 caliber pistol.'

03:45.208 --> 03:46.208
- The daughter?
- Mm-hmm.

03:46.291 --> 03:47.417
'The same type of gun'

03:47.500 --> 03:49.208
'that's killed
the three victims.'

03:49.291 --> 03:50.792
That's right.

03:50.875 --> 03:52.667
No more from the Commonwealth.

03:58.709 --> 04:01.083
Detective Vera,
you seem awfully sure

04:01.166 --> 04:02.792
my client
committed these murders.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.458
He had the key, the gun

04:04.542 --> 04:06.792
and the exact amount of cash
taken from the register.

04:06.875 --> 04:09.208
So, would it surprise you
to learn that Mr. Minter

04:09.291 --> 04:10.375
was actually
robbing a
store

04:10.458 --> 04:11.542
in West
Philly
that night?

04:11.625 --> 04:14.000
West Philly?
Yes, it would.

04:14.083 --> 04:16.583
What if I showed
you a videotape?

04:16.667 --> 04:18.000
'This is from
a security camera'

04:18.083 --> 04:19.208
at the Wawa
convenience store

04:19.291 --> 04:21.333
on the corner of
Spruce and 60th.

04:21.417 --> 04:22.750
'It clearly shows'

04:22.834 --> 04:24.834
my client was
six miles away

04:24.917 --> 04:26.375
from the scene when
these murders took place.

04:26.458 --> 04:28.375
Does that change your opinion,
Detective Vera?

04:34.083 --> 04:35.667
You know, you could've objected
a few times in there, okay?

04:35.750 --> 04:37.375
- You screwed the pooch, Vera.
- I screwed the pooch?

04:37.458 --> 04:39.166
- Yeah, how'd you miss this?
- West Detectives missed it.

04:39.250 --> 04:40.625
This was a bum case.

04:40.709 --> 04:42.667
Your office
approved the charges.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.000
How'd we not
know about this tape?

04:44.083 --> 04:45.750
His lawyer didn't
even know till today.

04:45.834 --> 04:48.208
Look, Squeak thought he was
gonna walk on that murder
rap

04:48.291 --> 04:50.375
and when it wasn't in the
cards,
he pulled that tape he stole

04:50.458 --> 04:51.667
when he did the robbery.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.542
Hey, Hat Squad,
way to go.

04:53.625 --> 04:56.083
You know, you guys
lost this one big.

04:57.375 --> 04:59.000
We can't lose this one.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.667
Vera got his ass
kicked in court?

05:44.750 --> 05:46.000
Case died
before our eyes.

05:46.083 --> 05:47.875
And Squeak took a plea
on the Wawa robbery.

05:47.959 --> 05:48.875
Gonna do five years.

05:48.959 --> 05:50.291
He didn't do
this triple, boss.

05:50.375 --> 05:52.208
Alright, so we start again,
Lil,
and we'll see who did.

05:52.291 --> 05:54.750
Hey, your name's
on this
interview.

05:54.834 --> 05:56.542
It was my last job
on the line.

05:56.625 --> 05:58.583
Vera took it over
when I went to cold jobs.

05:58.667 --> 06:00.417
Takes it over and
fumbles it, huh?

06:00.500 --> 06:02.750
Della and Tom Lincoln,
owned the restaurant

06:02.834 --> 06:04.041
for 25 years.

06:04.125 --> 06:05.709
Derek Jackson, 17

06:05.792 --> 06:07.959
worked there for
two years, no record.

06:08.041 --> 06:10.291
All three were shot
and her throat was cut.

06:10.375 --> 06:12.333
What makes you think
she was the target.

06:12.417 --> 06:13.625
And that it
was personal.

06:13.709 --> 06:15.083
And Della was
a block captain.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.333
Probably didn't
make her too popular

06:16.417 --> 06:18.125
with the neighborhood dirt bags.

06:18.208 --> 06:19.500
Vera got some
prints and DNA

06:19.583 --> 06:20.959
from the dinner trash,
but no hits.

06:21.041 --> 06:22.250
Yeah, we'll re-run
everything.

06:22.333 --> 06:24.166
Maybe the doer's in
the system a year later.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.333
Can't wait to
break his stones.

06:26.417 --> 06:28.542
Here's the
touchy part, Scotty.

06:28.625 --> 06:30.250
Jeffries knew the victims.

06:34.291 --> 06:36.625
This was
a solid investigation.

06:36.709 --> 06:37.792
Yeah.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.458
No way Homicide's gonna
know about a robbery.

06:39.542 --> 06:41.291
That's West Detectives.

06:41.375 --> 06:44.458
(Rush)
So, you landed on Minter
pretty quick last year, huh?

06:44.542 --> 06:47.000
Yeah. He worked there.
He had the key.

06:47.083 --> 06:48.458
It was practically gift-wrapped.

06:48.542 --> 06:49.625
Well, we all
thought it was him.

06:49.709 --> 06:51.458
We were wrong. Black eye.

06:51.542 --> 06:53.417
What can you tell us
about Della and Tom?

06:53.500 --> 06:55.166
Della's was a kind of sanctuary.

06:55.250 --> 06:56.667
If you kept your nose clean,
you were welcome.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.041
If you didn't, you were gone.

06:58.125 --> 07:00.667
Not easy keeping
a business open in the
Badlands.

07:00.750 --> 07:04.917
Della's was hopping every
night,
but since the murders..

07:05.000 --> 07:07.834
'...the whole neighborhood's
taken a slide.'

07:07.917 --> 07:10.166
Will, Della and Tom
had a daughter?

07:10.250 --> 07:11.333
Nora.

07:11.417 --> 07:12.667
'MBA student at Temple.'

07:12.750 --> 07:15.291
Why don't you and Lil
start with her?

07:15.375 --> 07:18.000
And, uh, what am I gonna do?

07:18.083 --> 07:19.583
There's this
other victim, Derek.

07:19.667 --> 07:21.041
He have any family?

07:21.125 --> 07:22.000
Addict brother.

07:22.083 --> 07:23.834
Want us to track him down, boss?

07:23.917 --> 07:25.667
Yeah.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.083
Guy didn't even
know his own name

07:27.166 --> 07:28.291
'when I notified him.'

07:28.375 --> 07:30.000
Let's see if he does now.

07:41.959 --> 07:43.417
Squeak Minter's on trial.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.667
'Thought he was goin' down.'

07:44.750 --> 07:47.166
Case was thrown out
this morning.

07:47.250 --> 07:48.875
For real?

07:48.959 --> 07:50.000
You know of
anyone else might

07:50.083 --> 07:51.375
have had a beef
with your brother?

07:51.458 --> 07:53.375
People loved Derek.

07:53.458 --> 07:54.917
He was a good kid.

07:57.458 --> 07:59.041
You mind?

08:01.458 --> 08:03.125
So how did he stay so good

08:03.208 --> 08:04.709
with you on the needle?

08:05.875 --> 08:07.083
Della and Tom.

08:07.166 --> 08:08.375
Weren't you
his guardian?

08:08.458 --> 08:09.792
Technically, but, uh

08:09.875 --> 08:11.208
they're the ones
looked out for him.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.458
How'd you clean up?

08:12.542 --> 08:14.750
Derek dying shook me up.

08:14.834 --> 08:16.125
I met a guy in recovery.

08:16.208 --> 08:18.917
Told me the Guard
teaches a trade.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.458
Gonna try and lock a union job.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.417
Did you see Derek
the night he died?

08:25.834 --> 08:27.250
Is that a yes or a no?

08:27.333 --> 08:29.250
I saw him.

08:29.333 --> 08:31.500
But I was distracted.

08:33.500 --> 08:34.917
Oh, you know Derek.

08:37.041 --> 08:38.500
Thought you said
you was gonna get
clean.

08:38.583 --> 08:41.458
I am. This, man..
It's no thing.

08:46.083 --> 08:47.625
Just walk like
you own the block.

08:47.709 --> 08:50.250
- Yo, check out the player.
- Yeah, yeah!

08:50.333 --> 08:52.166
Yo, Simms,
just back off, man.

08:53.625 --> 08:55.959
Where you think you're going?
Market Street?

08:56.041 --> 08:59.083
Look, man, I ain't
got
no problem with
you.

08:59.166 --> 09:01.125
But I got
a problem with you.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.625
See, like...50 problems.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.041
I ain't giving
you no money.

09:05.125 --> 09:06.000
You pay the tax

09:06.083 --> 09:07.834
or you come roll
with my crew.

09:07.917 --> 09:08.959
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

09:09.041 --> 09:09.959
I want you outta here.

09:10.041 --> 09:11.125
This ain't your business.

09:11.208 --> 09:12.166
You disrespect yourself

09:12.250 --> 09:13.417
that's your business.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.500
You mess with
this block, it's
mine.

09:15.583 --> 09:17.291
- You think this is your
block?
- Oh, that's right.

09:17.375 --> 09:18.709
And unless you
want your
friends

09:18.792 --> 09:20.500
to see you get
smacked
by an old woman

09:20.583 --> 09:22.166
you best move.

09:24.208 --> 09:25.583
You don't wanna mess with me.

09:25.667 --> 09:28.667
You got to ten to
make your ass
disappear.

09:29.458 --> 09:30.709
One.

09:31.500 --> 09:32.750
Two.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.083
Three.

09:35.959 --> 09:37.333
We'll see you later.

09:39.542 --> 09:41.834
Let's roll.

09:53.917 --> 09:55.291
I never even moved.

09:55.375 --> 09:56.667
You think Simms
might have come back

09:56.750 --> 09:58.542
for her that night?

09:58.625 --> 10:01.041
Della stared
down thugs.

10:01.125 --> 10:03.208
In the neighborhood,
that makes people love
you

10:03.291 --> 10:05.500
but it also makes you enemies.

10:05.583 --> 10:07.542
You know where Simms is now?

10:08.750 --> 10:11.291
I stay away from that life.

10:11.375 --> 10:14.417
Would have been nice if you
told me this last year, Tre.

10:14.500 --> 10:17.667
I was sick,
I was scared
and..

10:17.750 --> 10:19.166
I'm trying to
do some good now.

10:19.250 --> 10:22.667
Hey, you kicked drugs,
did a stint in the Guard.

10:22.750 --> 10:25.041
A resume like that,
you could end up president.

10:41.458 --> 10:44.166
(Will)
It's crazy how you
take out one small place

10:44.250 --> 10:47.250
and a whole neighborhood
suddenly feels hopeless.

10:48.625 --> 10:50.458
That big a difference,
huh?

10:50.542 --> 10:53.458
Well, stop the
heart,
the body dies.

10:56.458 --> 10:59.750
So, you didn't want in
on this case last year?

10:59.834 --> 11:01.834
Stillman thought
I was too close.

11:03.041 --> 11:04.458
Will!

11:04.542 --> 11:05.750
Hi, Nora.

11:05.834 --> 11:07.917
- I'm sorry about this
morning.
- Oh, that's okay.

11:08.750 --> 11:09.917
This is Lilly Rush.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.709
She was the first
detective on the
job.

11:11.792 --> 11:13.709
- Thanks for meeting us here.
- Sure.

11:16.166 --> 11:17.458
No one's stepped foot in here

11:17.542 --> 11:20.333
since the police
left that morning.

11:20.417 --> 11:21.291
No one?

11:21.375 --> 11:22.792
I just locked the door

11:22.875 --> 11:24.166
and walked away.

11:26.834 --> 11:27.875
Why don't you talk out here

11:27.959 --> 11:29.500
I'll...go in.

11:36.667 --> 11:39.250
How you doing, detectives?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.208
It's a bad case of death.

12:06.208 --> 12:07.625
Lil.

12:11.917 --> 12:13.667
You had dinner here
that night?

12:13.750 --> 12:15.125
Uh, yeah, um..

12:15.208 --> 12:16.291
...while they
were setting
up

12:16.375 --> 12:18.333
before my class.

12:18.417 --> 12:20.959
Remember any conversations
your parents had?

12:21.041 --> 12:23.500
- Um..
- Arguments?

12:23.583 --> 12:24.625
Just some back and forth

12:24.709 --> 12:26.583
with my mom
and the
waitress.

12:26.667 --> 12:27.959
What about?

12:31.333 --> 12:33.667
I couldn't really tell.

12:33.750 --> 12:36.000
I know what I saw.

12:36.083 --> 12:37.125
You're wrong.

12:37.208 --> 12:38.166
This kinda problem

12:38.250 --> 12:39.458
doesn't
go away by
itself.

12:39.542 --> 12:40.917
There is no problem.

12:42.583 --> 12:44.625
Honey, look me in the eye.

12:44.709 --> 12:46.583
Look, you don't wanna
get into this.

12:46.667 --> 12:49.375
- It'll get you hurt.
- I don't scare.

12:49.458 --> 12:51.834
Now, come into the light
and look me in the eye.

12:53.875 --> 12:55.875
Mom, leave her alone.

12:55.959 --> 12:57.250
The girl needs help.

12:57.333 --> 12:58.333
Daddy?

12:58.417 --> 12:59.417
Don't look at me.

12:59.500 --> 13:00.875
I got a daughter majors
in business

13:00.959 --> 13:03.083
a wife who majors
in other people's business.

13:03.166 --> 13:05.583
Me, I'm just
a restaurant owner.

13:05.667 --> 13:08.041
Mom, you keep
sticking your nose

13:08.125 --> 13:10.959
where it doesn't belong
you're gonna get it cut off.

13:11.041 --> 13:13.583
That's the last thing
I ever said to my mother.

13:16.792 --> 13:18.208
Where can we find
the waitress?

13:18.291 --> 13:20.208
Oh.

13:20.291 --> 13:22.709
My mother collected strays.

13:22.792 --> 13:24.333
Her name was Tyra.

13:24.417 --> 13:25.875
Her number's probably
in the back.

13:25.959 --> 13:28.917
You might wanna
call the cleaning service,
Nora.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.458
I'll clean up.

13:30.542 --> 13:32.291
I'd hire someone.

13:32.375 --> 13:35.083
Uh, once the
bodies
are removed

13:35.166 --> 13:36.542
the department's
work
is done.

13:36.625 --> 13:39.792
So no one's cleaned
up
in there.

14:09.834 --> 14:11.750
I'm gonna stay a few minutes.

14:33.792 --> 14:35.125
Della was nosing
in this Tyra's
business

14:35.208 --> 14:36.792
the night of the murders.

14:36.875 --> 14:37.792
So?

14:37.875 --> 14:39.083
So, Tyra didn't take

14:39.166 --> 14:41.208
too kindly to it.

14:41.291 --> 14:43.542
I interviewed that waitress.
She ain't our shooter.

14:43.625 --> 14:46.041
Still worth
a second conversation.

14:46.125 --> 14:47.625
Way more likely
it's this Simms guy.

14:47.709 --> 14:48.959
What's his
story,
Nick?

14:49.041 --> 14:51.000
He's a thug.
Deals drugs on the
corner.

14:51.083 --> 14:52.500
He's flashing a gun around.

14:52.583 --> 14:55.083
He had words with
Della
and Derek that night.

14:55.166 --> 14:56.375
Well, her throat being cut

14:56.458 --> 14:57.875
says it was
more personal than that.

14:57.959 --> 15:00.083
She dissed him
in front of his crew.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.625
That's personal
to these mugwumps.

15:02.709 --> 15:04.500
JT Simms' juvie records.

15:04.583 --> 15:08.166
2001, robbed a White
Castle
right at closing.

15:08.250 --> 15:09.959
Same MO as
the Chicken and Ribs job.

15:10.041 --> 15:11.250
Getting better all the time.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.125
How the hell'd we miss
Simms last year?

15:13.208 --> 15:14.458
(Vera)
'You know how chatty
people are'

15:14.542 --> 15:17.291
ratting out
the neighborhood badass.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.333
We'll follow up on Tyra.

15:19.417 --> 15:21.041
Simms is the better bet.

15:21.125 --> 15:22.333
Run 'em both down.

15:22.417 --> 15:23.750
Check on Derek's friend, Joe

15:23.834 --> 15:25.333
while you're at it.

15:27.417 --> 15:29.083
(Rush)
Let's hit the Badlands.

15:38.417 --> 15:39.959
We understand
the night of the murders

15:40.041 --> 15:41.542
you and Della were arguing.

15:43.000 --> 15:43.959
No, I don't think so.

15:44.041 --> 15:45.000
Della's daughter
says it was over

15:45.083 --> 15:46.417
some problem you were having.

15:46.500 --> 15:47.834
Probably just
some misunderstanding

15:47.917 --> 15:49.458
about my schedule.

15:50.166 --> 15:51.875
This is Jammal.

15:51.959 --> 15:53.792
They're asking
about
Della and Tom.

15:55.542 --> 15:58.000
So, what, that boy Squeak
didn't do that?

15:58.083 --> 15:59.667
No.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.875
You don't seem surprised.

16:01.959 --> 16:03.917
You tell 'em about Frank?

16:04.000 --> 16:05.917
- No.
- Who's Frank?

16:07.250 --> 16:10.000
He, um, he did odd jobs,
at Della's.

16:10.083 --> 16:13.125
Oh, he did
other things too.

16:13.208 --> 16:15.125
Tell 'em what you saw.

16:32.291 --> 16:34.500
Della was messing with Frank?

16:34.583 --> 16:36.709
It's-it's
just
what I
saw.

16:36.792 --> 16:39.333
You never told anyone?

16:39.417 --> 16:43.083
People shouldn't get messed up
in other people's
relationships.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.834
I don't know.

16:59.375 --> 17:01.250
No, no.

17:01.333 --> 17:02.291
Never seen him.

17:02.375 --> 17:03.417
JT Simms.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.917
Hung on the corner here
for two years

17:05.000 --> 17:06.250
right in front of your stoop.

17:06.333 --> 17:07.375
No.

17:10.166 --> 17:11.291
Thanks a million.

17:16.667 --> 17:17.834
(Valens)
She give you anything?

17:17.917 --> 17:19.875
(Vera)
Told me to go pound sand.

17:19.959 --> 17:22.125
Who else can we find
to lie to us?

17:23.667 --> 17:25.625
You still
seeing
that girl?

17:25.709 --> 17:28.083
Melisa? Nah.

17:28.166 --> 17:29.709
What happened?

17:29.792 --> 17:33.458
Nothin'.
Just, uh, time to move on.

17:33.542 --> 17:35.917
So you're
back
in the hunt?

17:36.959 --> 17:39.333
Uh...I guess.

17:39.417 --> 17:43.667
Well, a couple of nurses down
at
St. Joe's up for a night out.

17:43.750 --> 17:45.125
Your wife comin'?

17:48.709 --> 17:50.667
Someone's trying to
get our attention.

17:58.709 --> 18:01.834
You lookin' for Stick Simms?

18:01.917 --> 18:03.375
(Nora)
'I'm putting this place
on the market'

18:03.458 --> 18:06.500
hoping somebody's
lookin'
for a tax write-off.

18:06.583 --> 18:09.125
Ever think about
opening it again?

18:09.208 --> 18:10.834
Not in this neighborhood.

18:10.917 --> 18:12.458
'Yeah, well,
whoever killed my parents'

18:12.542 --> 18:14.250
probably lives
within two blocks of here.

18:14.333 --> 18:16.792
I can't smile
and serve them every day.

18:18.250 --> 18:21.625
So, um...you wanted
to know about Frank?

18:21.709 --> 18:24.709
Well, Tyra said he might have
been close with your parents.

18:24.792 --> 18:26.959
- With my mom maybe.
- Why's that?

18:27.041 --> 18:30.041
She had a weakness for men
who needed to be saved.

18:30.125 --> 18:32.166
Um, are you hiring?

18:32.250 --> 18:33.500
No, honey. I'm sorry.

18:36.250 --> 18:38.583
Do you know
Frank's last name?

18:38.667 --> 18:39.792
Morgan, I think.

18:39.875 --> 18:41.333
Buster Morgan, the boxer?

18:41.417 --> 18:43.834
- Yeah. My dad called him
that.
- Yeah.

18:43.917 --> 18:45.041
You know where he stays?

18:45.125 --> 18:47.208
He never had
a permanent situation.

18:47.291 --> 18:48.709
Why are you asking about Frank?

18:48.792 --> 18:50.625
His name came up is all.

18:52.458 --> 18:55.792
Guy from the shelter said try
the tent city round the
corner.

18:55.875 --> 18:58.291
That's behind
Big Ed's gym.

18:58.375 --> 19:00.166
You know this
area pretty good, huh?

19:00.250 --> 19:01.542
I grew up two blocks over.

19:01.625 --> 19:04.333
I used to go to that gym
and watch the guys spar.

19:05.583 --> 19:06.750
You ever get in the ring?

19:06.834 --> 19:09.250
No, I got hit
enough
in my own house.

19:09.333 --> 19:11.917
- Frank! Frank Morgan?
- There.

19:17.542 --> 19:19.375
I'm Frank. What?

19:19.458 --> 19:21.583
It's Will Jeffries, Buster.

19:21.667 --> 19:22.959
Will who?

19:24.750 --> 19:26.583
We're here about Della Lincoln.

19:26.667 --> 19:27.667
You know Della?

19:27.750 --> 19:30.709
We're investigating her murder.

19:30.792 --> 19:31.709
Right.

19:31.792 --> 19:34.125
Stupid.
'Cause Della's gone.

19:34.208 --> 19:36.291
We got a witness,
saw you and Della kissing

19:36.375 --> 19:38.125
the night she died.

19:38.208 --> 19:39.792
- Tom?
- Tom's dead, too.

19:39.875 --> 19:41.500
'Cause it was a mistake.

19:41.583 --> 19:42.875
What was?

19:45.542 --> 19:46.834
Come on, Frank.

19:48.083 --> 19:50.208
Tell us what happened
that night.

19:55.834 --> 19:57.959
Did you lose something?

20:00.083 --> 20:01.583
Where'd you get that?

20:01.667 --> 20:04.083
Tom found them in the trash.

20:04.166 --> 20:05.333
Oh.

20:05.417 --> 20:06.834
You gotta take 'em, Frank.

20:06.917 --> 20:08.917
You can't forget,
not even for a day.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.458
- They make me tired.
- They keep you right.

20:11.542 --> 20:12.625
I know.

20:12.709 --> 20:15.542
We're gonna get you
back on your feet.

20:15.625 --> 20:18.208
No. No. No, Frank. No.

20:18.291 --> 20:20.041
What is goin' on?

20:23.125 --> 20:25.291
I'm-I'm.. I'll just..

20:25.375 --> 20:26.625
I won't come back.
I'm sorry.

20:26.709 --> 20:29.583
Wait a minute.
Frank. Frank!

20:29.667 --> 20:31.792
Della cares about you,
just like I do.

20:31.875 --> 20:33.458
'But there's different
kinds of caring.'

20:33.542 --> 20:35.750
- You can't confuse the two.
- I know.

20:35.834 --> 20:37.625
You can't go kissing
on other men's wives.

20:37.709 --> 20:41.250
Oh, I won't.
I won't.

20:41.333 --> 20:42.709
Give me that stuff.

20:47.583 --> 20:49.709
Dinner crowd's
gonna be in soon.

20:52.375 --> 20:53.917
He didn't kick me out

20:54.000 --> 20:55.333
when by rights,
he could've.

20:55.417 --> 20:57.667
What were the meds for?

20:57.750 --> 20:59.542
I get extreme.

20:59.625 --> 21:01.417
Did you get
extreme that
night?

21:01.500 --> 21:02.834
Hurt Della and Tom?

21:02.917 --> 21:05.834
Hurt them? They was the only
thing holding me together.

21:07.750 --> 21:11.083
Frank, do you remember a fight
between Della and Tyra?

21:13.417 --> 21:16.834
Della caught her
putting on makeup.

21:16.917 --> 21:17.917
What do you mean?

21:18.000 --> 21:19.375
Her boyfriend

21:19.458 --> 21:23.959
hit her and Tyra was
trying to cover up the bruise.

21:26.875 --> 21:29.709
You couldn't fool Della, see?

21:38.792 --> 21:39.959
(Valens)
'JT Simms?'

21:40.041 --> 21:41.417
No-o-o!

21:43.625 --> 21:45.125
What did I do?

21:46.458 --> 21:47.875
You tell us.

21:47.959 --> 21:50.417
It's about the murders
at that chicken and ribs
place

21:50.500 --> 21:52.041
last year.

21:52.125 --> 21:53.458
Don't remember nothin'
about it.

21:53.542 --> 21:55.625
You sure?

21:55.709 --> 21:57.041
'Cause if my boys saw me

21:57.125 --> 22:00.250
almost get
bitch-slapped
by an old woman..

22:00.333 --> 22:02.208
...I know I'd remember.

22:02.291 --> 22:04.959
You better get Biggie here
out of my face.

22:05.041 --> 22:06.583
Della made you
look small.

22:06.667 --> 22:08.834
Maybe you went back later
to settle the score, huh?

22:08.917 --> 22:10.208
Using that gun
you flashed

22:10.291 --> 22:13.250
at Derek Jackson
and Joe Moore that night.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.166
I ain't talkin' no more.

22:16.250 --> 22:17.750
Why not?

22:17.834 --> 22:18.917
What you scared of, Joe?

22:19.000 --> 22:21.709
Who you think runs the game now?

22:21.792 --> 22:24.083
So he took your place
out there, huh?

22:24.166 --> 22:25.917
How'd that happen?

22:26.000 --> 22:26.917
Hey, Stick

22:27.000 --> 22:29.041
we got you at the scene
that night.

22:29.125 --> 22:30.250
'You beefed with
two of the victims'

22:30.333 --> 22:31.792
got priors with the same MO.

22:31.875 --> 22:33.250
(Vera)
'And don't try and play
that cripple card.'

22:33.333 --> 22:35.166
Triple murderers get no love.

22:40.959 --> 22:44.083
I seen Joe outside
the restaurant the next day.

22:50.625 --> 22:51.875
Stay back.

22:55.667 --> 22:56.917
Copy that.

22:59.875 --> 23:02.834
Got three in there.

23:04.625 --> 23:07.000
Don't leave till you talk
to the detective on this
job.

23:07.083 --> 23:09.792
What, that ain't you?

23:09.875 --> 23:10.959
Not anymore.

23:11.041 --> 23:12.709
Ask for Detective Vera.

23:13.917 --> 23:15.959
Your friend in there?

23:16.041 --> 23:17.917
Yeah.

23:18.583 --> 23:19.834
I'm sorry.

23:23.208 --> 23:25.166
Check out Homicide Barbie.

23:28.542 --> 23:31.458
- Your boy Derek in there?
- Yep.

23:31.542 --> 23:34.291
Roll with me,
be my soldier.

23:34.375 --> 23:35.542
You don't got to worry
about something

23:35.625 --> 23:38.083
like that
happening to you.

23:38.166 --> 23:39.792
- Yo, dawg--
- Yo, I ain't your dawg!

23:39.875 --> 23:41.333
Then what are you?

23:41.417 --> 23:44.333
Somebody you gotta
step around.

23:44.417 --> 23:45.834
Take a look.

23:45.917 --> 23:47.333
See what I can do?

23:50.417 --> 23:52.583
You saying you took
your own boy out?

23:55.041 --> 23:56.709
Maybe you can
be my soldier.

24:04.792 --> 24:07.250
It was biblical, man.
Ice cold.

24:07.333 --> 24:08.500
And you just believed him?

24:08.583 --> 24:10.166
Just rolled over,
gave up your turf?

24:10.250 --> 24:12.125
That brother turned hard, man.

24:12.208 --> 24:14.959
He backed it up,
came down on my crew.

24:15.041 --> 24:18.000
Then, where do we find Joe?

24:18.083 --> 24:19.667
Man, I tell you that,
I get killed.

24:19.750 --> 24:22.333
Not if he goes away for this.

24:22.417 --> 24:25.166
Triple murder gets you a
date
with the needle real quick.

24:29.792 --> 24:32.709
So we're off Frank
as a suspect?

24:32.792 --> 24:33.917
He's goofed in the head

24:34.000 --> 24:35.875
but he doesn't have
murder in him.

24:35.959 --> 24:37.875
Told us Tyra's secret, though.

24:37.959 --> 24:40.458
Her boyfriend Jammal
was beating her up

24:40.542 --> 24:42.417
and Della was wise to it.

24:42.500 --> 24:43.750
Scotty called in.

24:43.834 --> 24:45.583
They're lookin' to
pick up Joe Moore.

24:45.667 --> 24:46.542
Derek's friend?

24:46.625 --> 24:47.625
Yeah, guess he bragged to Simms

24:47.709 --> 24:49.041
about being the shooter.

24:49.125 --> 24:51.083
That kid was in
shock at the scene.

24:51.166 --> 24:52.458
Playing dumb?

24:54.250 --> 24:56.834
Something hinky
in this lab report.

24:56.917 --> 24:58.041
Like what?

24:58.125 --> 24:59.458
Well, the first time
they ran the prints

24:59.542 --> 25:02.000
they excluded matches
for the victims.

25:02.083 --> 25:03.875
'They did a blanket search
this time.'

25:03.959 --> 25:08.125
And Derek's prints are
all over Della and Tom's
shoes.

25:10.500 --> 25:12.458
Dragging the bodies?

25:12.542 --> 25:13.917
Oh, God.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.083
Tell me Derek wasn't in on this.

25:16.166 --> 25:18.417
Derek and Joe were pals,
right, Lil?

25:19.709 --> 25:21.792
Could be an inside job gone bad.

25:36.792 --> 25:38.417
(Vera)
'We wake you, Joe?'

25:42.625 --> 25:44.208
Yeah, can I get a Coke
or somethin'?

25:44.291 --> 25:45.959
Why don't we visit
here a minute.

25:46.041 --> 25:47.750
You had a busy year.

25:47.834 --> 25:51.792
Possession,
ag-assault,
assault with intent.

25:51.875 --> 25:54.458
Taking down Della's
gave you a taste, is that
it?

25:54.542 --> 25:56.041
How'd it work that night?

25:56.125 --> 25:58.166
Did Derek leave the back door
open for you or what?

25:58.250 --> 26:00.500
- Why you talking about Derek?
- You and him robbed that
place.

26:00.583 --> 26:02.709
Maybe so you could pay for that
sweet Escalade you're pushing.

26:02.792 --> 26:05.250
Have some respect, alright?
You know, Derek is dead.

26:06.875 --> 26:08.041
Well, he wasn't dead

26:08.125 --> 26:09.583
when he dragged
Della and Tom's body

26:09.667 --> 26:11.917
into the bathroom.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.709
We got those prints, Joe.

26:13.792 --> 26:17.375
Then maybe Derek lost it
after you shot Della and Tom.

26:17.458 --> 26:18.500
You couldn't trust him
to shut up

26:18.583 --> 26:21.208
so you had to pop him, too.

26:21.291 --> 26:23.125
Nah, nah,
me and Derek was tight.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.709
Yeah, but you were going
different ways.

26:24.792 --> 26:25.792
Derek was straight.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.041
He had no stomach for the life.

26:27.125 --> 26:28.875
Not like you.
You were tough.

26:28.959 --> 26:30.417
Getting sick and tired

26:30.500 --> 26:34.083
of having no scratch and
getting
hassled on the block, right?

26:34.166 --> 26:37.166
That night...
was your coming out.

26:39.125 --> 26:43.208
You wanna know where I was
at when Derek got shot?

26:43.291 --> 26:46.125
Taking a boot to the head
from my mom's boyfriend.

26:46.208 --> 26:47.500
'Nine stitches.'

26:47.583 --> 26:49.792
Ask at the Temple ER.

26:49.875 --> 26:52.583
So why'd you brag to everyone
you did the murders?

26:55.417 --> 26:57.959
You think anyone on that block
looked at me since then?

27:03.917 --> 27:05.166
Tyra's here.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.959
Say, I got some kinda bench
warrant or something?

27:18.041 --> 27:21.166
Yeah, but this isn't really
about the warrant.

27:23.208 --> 27:24.500
It's about Jammal.

27:34.959 --> 27:36.250
What about him?

27:36.333 --> 27:38.583
I know he hit you, Tyra.

27:38.667 --> 27:39.959
No, you don't.

27:48.458 --> 27:49.792
Della knew, too.

27:51.417 --> 27:52.583
And from what
I hear about Della

27:52.667 --> 27:54.166
she could be pretty forceful

27:54.250 --> 27:55.750
if she wanted something.

27:55.834 --> 27:56.959
That's the truth.

27:57.041 --> 28:00.834
And I bet she wanted you
to leave Jammal.

28:00.917 --> 28:03.166
That's what you were
fighting about that day.

28:07.083 --> 28:10.083
We're talking
about Della here.

28:10.166 --> 28:12.250
Don't you owe her
the truth?

28:14.166 --> 28:17.250
She said I could
come stay with
her.

28:17.333 --> 28:19.291
Must have pissed Jammal
off pretty good.

28:19.375 --> 28:21.208
No, Jammal didn't know.

28:23.583 --> 28:26.000
If he was pissed at anyone..

28:27.000 --> 28:28.959
...it was Derek.

28:29.041 --> 28:30.834
Why?

28:37.834 --> 28:41.000
Those things will
kill you, ya know.

28:41.083 --> 28:43.834
Go back in. Della will be
looking for you.

28:43.917 --> 28:45.208
You okay?

28:51.792 --> 28:52.875
It's nothin'.

28:52.959 --> 28:54.458
Tyra, you know
you deserve someone

28:54.542 --> 28:56.458
who treats you right.

28:56.542 --> 28:58.375
Too bad you ain't
five years older.

28:58.458 --> 29:01.500
Hey, I'm old enough to know
a good thing when I see it.

29:01.583 --> 29:03.875
Hey, my mama didn't
raise no fool, now.

29:05.667 --> 29:08.750
It's about time you smiled.

29:10.041 --> 29:11.625
Look, you don't
want this, Derek.

29:11.709 --> 29:12.917
'You're going places.'

29:13.000 --> 29:14.917
Who says I don't have
room for two?

29:15.000 --> 29:16.333
You're a kid.

29:16.417 --> 29:19.000
So, give me a few years.

29:24.875 --> 29:27.208
I'm gonna to make
sure you're around that long.

29:34.625 --> 29:36.083
Let's go in.

29:41.208 --> 29:42.458
He, um..

29:45.125 --> 29:48.083
He was a sweet,
sweet boy.

29:48.166 --> 29:50.083
Did Jammal kill those people?

29:50.166 --> 29:51.834
I don't know.

29:51.917 --> 29:53.834
I really don't.

29:53.917 --> 29:56.792
But, uh..

29:56.875 --> 29:59.709
...he never came
home that night.

30:01.166 --> 30:02.917
Okay.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.542
This is a place
you can be safe.

30:05.625 --> 30:07.709
And I'm gonna
write my number on the back.

30:13.291 --> 30:15.458
Don't go home, Tyra.

30:18.792 --> 30:21.333
No.

30:21.417 --> 30:23.625
Where am I gonna
find Jammal?

30:23.709 --> 30:26.792
Joe's ER alibi checked out.
Had to cut him loose.

30:26.875 --> 30:28.750
I like Jammal's motive
more anyway.

30:28.834 --> 30:31.709
So, did Vera
screw this job up

30:31.792 --> 30:32.875
after he took it from you?

30:32.959 --> 30:33.875
I don't know.

30:33.959 --> 30:35.250
He did have some trouble at home

30:35.333 --> 30:36.542
this time last year.

30:39.375 --> 30:40.917
Scotty. Rush.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.125
Hi.

30:43.208 --> 30:45.625
I'll get the car.

30:47.041 --> 30:49.208
You kinda snapped out
in court the other
day.

30:49.291 --> 30:51.041
I kinda got made a fool of.

30:51.125 --> 30:53.792
We got new direction on the
job,
might bring it back to you.

30:53.875 --> 30:56.542
Really? Will
Vera testify again--

30:56.625 --> 30:57.875
Kite.

30:59.542 --> 31:00.750
So what's the new angle?

31:00.834 --> 31:02.083
Looks like
a jealous
boyfriend

31:02.166 --> 31:03.959
had it out for the
kid
who worked there.

31:04.041 --> 31:06.417
Always love, isn't it?

31:06.500 --> 31:08.500
Or money.

31:08.583 --> 31:10.959
We're gonna have
to work together, Rush.

31:11.041 --> 31:13.667
We will.

31:13.750 --> 31:15.583
So, how are you anyway?

31:15.667 --> 31:18.083
Great, great.

31:18.166 --> 31:20.709
Or good, at least.

31:20.792 --> 31:22.667
You regret it?

31:22.750 --> 31:24.583
No.

31:24.667 --> 31:25.959
Me neither.

31:28.792 --> 31:30.166
You been
to First Thursdays lately?

31:30.250 --> 31:31.834
Not lately, no.

31:32.709 --> 31:33.959
Bye, Kite.

31:38.625 --> 31:39.834
I barely knew
that kid.

31:39.917 --> 31:41.125
Yeah, all you needed
to know was that

31:41.208 --> 31:42.875
he was touching
the merchandise.

31:44.792 --> 31:46.625
Your girl left you
for a 17-year-old.

31:46.709 --> 31:47.834
That'd be
pretty
embarrassing.

31:47.917 --> 31:49.291
She wasn't gonna leave.

31:49.375 --> 31:50.709
Derek painted her
a pretty nice
picture.

31:50.792 --> 31:51.834
You heard it yourself.

31:51.917 --> 31:54.875
Trust me.
Tyra wouldn't leave.

31:54.959 --> 31:57.417
'Cause you'd break her face
if she did?

31:59.125 --> 32:00.166
I didn't do
those murders.

32:00.250 --> 32:01.583
You don't have
an alibi.

32:01.667 --> 32:03.750
But you got motive
and opportunity.

32:03.834 --> 32:05.208
You better start
talking about what happened

32:05.291 --> 32:07.709
in that alley, Jammal.

32:07.792 --> 32:10.291
Just a little
life lesson.

32:10.375 --> 32:12.166
"Don't touch
the
merchandise."

32:16.083 --> 32:17.500
Let's go in.

32:17.583 --> 32:18.792
Just tell me
I'm not crazy.

32:18.875 --> 32:20.125
Derek.

32:23.250 --> 32:25.000
Jammal, leave him!

32:25.083 --> 32:26.500
You trying to get with my girl?

32:26.583 --> 32:28.458
- Jammal!
- You messing with my girl,
man?

32:28.542 --> 32:29.917
What you gonna hit me
like you hit her?

32:30.000 --> 32:31.375
Don't..

32:31.458 --> 32:33.667
You wanna
get with
her?

32:33.750 --> 32:34.834
I can't hear you!

32:34.917 --> 32:36.041
I can't hear you!

32:36.125 --> 32:37.041
He's just a kid!

32:37.125 --> 32:38.875
(Tre)
'Hey, hey, hey!'

32:38.959 --> 32:40.917
You messin' with
my brother, hmm?

32:41.041 --> 32:43.542
Messing with my brother, huh?

32:45.291 --> 32:47.000
What is going on?

32:47.083 --> 32:48.583
Don't come back,
Jammal!

32:48.667 --> 32:49.750
Whatever!

32:50.959 --> 32:54.208
So I left, okay?
My business was done.

32:54.291 --> 32:55.500
Where'd you go?

32:57.125 --> 32:59.041
Hey, you need
an alibi, brother.

32:59.125 --> 33:00.583
A girl.

33:00.667 --> 33:02.041
A girl that ain't Tyra.

33:02.125 --> 33:03.458
Scotty.

33:05.125 --> 33:06.667
Don't go nowhere.

33:09.291 --> 33:11.041
Shooting in
the Badlands.

33:11.125 --> 33:13.583
JT Simms got gunned down
in his wheelchair.

33:20.375 --> 33:22.208
Life's cheap, huh, Joe?

33:24.083 --> 33:26.750
Take down a guy
in a wheelchair?

33:26.834 --> 33:27.875
That's pretty brave.

33:27.959 --> 33:29.208
- It wasn't me.
- No?

33:29.291 --> 33:30.417
Well, who else
you figure would wanna

33:30.500 --> 33:32.000
shoot down Stick Simms?

33:32.083 --> 33:34.083
Someone talks to the
cops,
they gonna get smoked.

33:35.166 --> 33:36.959
What happened, Joe?

33:37.041 --> 33:39.500
You and Derek steered clear
of the streets.

33:39.583 --> 33:41.750
You were on the path.

33:41.834 --> 33:45.542
What would Derek think
if he saw you sitting in
here?

33:45.625 --> 33:49.083
Derek is dead.
Della and Tom are dead.

33:49.166 --> 33:50.750
Rest of us do
what it take to survive.

33:50.834 --> 33:52.667
Nothing more important
than street creds, right?

33:52.750 --> 33:54.041
Hey, don't talk
like you know me.

33:54.125 --> 33:56.750
Vera, you wanna get
Joe
a soft drink?

34:09.125 --> 34:11.458
I was friends
with Della and
Tom.

34:11.542 --> 34:14.583
- Good for you.
- Don't disrespect them.

34:14.667 --> 34:16.083
They deserve better.

34:18.917 --> 34:20.667
You and I are alike, Joe.

34:20.750 --> 34:22.291
You see me working for the man?

34:22.375 --> 34:24.709
I grew up
in the Badlands.

34:24.792 --> 34:25.875
Had crap parents

34:25.959 --> 34:27.542
who didn't have
any interest in me

34:27.625 --> 34:30.667
except to send me out
to buy their cigarettes.

34:30.750 --> 34:33.667
- So?
- So, I had a football coach.

34:33.750 --> 34:35.333
Got me off the corners.

34:35.417 --> 34:36.792
Showed me discipline.

34:36.875 --> 34:38.000
Said I could be something

34:38.083 --> 34:40.709
instead of just another
street hanger.

34:40.792 --> 34:44.041
And I had a best friend
like Derek.

34:44.125 --> 34:47.041
We made plans
to get a better life.

34:47.125 --> 34:48.417
If I'd lost either of 'em

34:48.500 --> 34:51.500
I don't know which way
I would have turned.

34:51.583 --> 34:54.417
I know you woke up one morning..

34:54.500 --> 34:57.375
...and everyone you
put hope in was gone.

34:57.458 --> 35:00.625
- I got by.
- Look around, Joe.

35:00.709 --> 35:03.709
This is the end of the line.

35:09.875 --> 35:11.625
I don't know
who killed Derek and them.

35:11.709 --> 35:14.333
Well, help me
figure out who did.

35:14.417 --> 35:16.166
You two always
went home together.

35:16.250 --> 35:17.709
Why not that night?

35:19.583 --> 35:22.000
'Cause Derek wasn't
going home.

35:22.083 --> 35:23.792
What is going on?

35:23.875 --> 35:25.250
Don't come back,
Jammal!

35:25.834 --> 35:27.000
Whatever.

35:29.542 --> 35:32.917
Tyra, honey?
Go on inside.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.625
Give me a hand with him.

35:35.917 --> 35:38.333
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

35:38.417 --> 35:40.375
I'd take some blows
for her, too.

35:40.458 --> 35:41.667
Tre?

35:44.625 --> 35:46.333
Tre Jackson?

35:46.417 --> 35:48.333
Oh, son.

35:48.417 --> 35:49.834
I stopped him
from beating on you.

35:49.917 --> 35:51.291
How many times
you tell me you
were

35:51.375 --> 35:52.500
cleaning yourself up?

35:52.583 --> 35:53.834
He promised.

35:53.917 --> 35:55.792
It breaks my heart
to see you like
this.

35:55.875 --> 35:58.417
But if you can't look
after
Derek, it's best if I
do.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.333
Tell her how I
look out for you.

36:00.417 --> 36:01.875
You get yourself together..

36:01.959 --> 36:03.125
...you come back.

36:08.250 --> 36:09.625
Go on home.

36:09.709 --> 36:11.875
Derek's gonna
stay here a while.

36:12.917 --> 36:14.333
Tomorrow.

36:14.417 --> 36:16.333
Yeah.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.583
Woke up the next day
and everything was
different.

36:33.250 --> 36:34.291
Right.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.083
So he go for
shooting Simms?

36:42.166 --> 36:43.500
Not yet.

36:43.583 --> 36:45.000
Community service
murder, right?

36:45.083 --> 36:46.959
Now they're both off
the streets?

36:48.166 --> 36:51.291
Yeah, it's just the Badlands.
Who cares?

36:51.375 --> 36:52.959
Just two thugs.
So no, I don't care.

36:53.041 --> 36:54.959
Ever think there'd be
one less murder

36:55.041 --> 36:58.166
if you'd worked this
job right a year ago?

37:00.041 --> 37:01.417
I worked a good case.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.083
Look, you wanna be sloppy

37:03.166 --> 37:04.959
in your personal life,
your marriage, you go
ahead--

37:05.041 --> 37:06.291
Don't you talk
about my marriage.

37:06.375 --> 37:09.500
But don't be a
bum
on this job.

37:09.583 --> 37:11.667
Will, let's take a walk.

37:21.542 --> 37:23.041
Lil, um..

37:25.542 --> 37:28.834
Tre told us he saw Derek
early that night.

37:28.917 --> 37:32.709
But, uh, he didn't mention
this
bottle incident later on.

37:50.417 --> 37:52.625
(Range Master)
'Stand down on the firing
line.'

37:56.959 --> 37:58.000
What's up?

37:58.083 --> 37:59.500
You said last time
you saw Derek

37:59.583 --> 38:01.166
was early in the night.

38:02.917 --> 38:04.000
Yeah.

38:04.083 --> 38:06.208
But you came back later
all strung out.

38:08.291 --> 38:11.625
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Da-damn, I forgot.

38:11.709 --> 38:13.000
I..

38:13.083 --> 38:14.291
It was an ugly fight.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.959
It's tough to forget.

38:17.041 --> 38:18.375
We've got DNA
from the scene.

38:18.458 --> 38:20.375
Maybe we run it through
the military data bank,
huh?

38:26.625 --> 38:28.250
Let go of the rifle, Tre.

38:31.625 --> 38:33.583
Tre, let it go.

38:42.959 --> 38:45.542
I wouldn't have let someone
go to jail for it.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.625
I would have told the truth.

38:55.709 --> 38:57.125
Tell us.

39:15.041 --> 39:17.291
Why'd you come back here?

39:17.375 --> 39:19.208
I need ten bucks.

39:19.291 --> 39:20.709
You heard Della.

39:20.792 --> 39:23.208
You can't keep coming
here wasted, man!

39:23.291 --> 39:25.333
Look, it's for food, man.

39:25.417 --> 39:26.709
Look, I'm hungry.

39:28.333 --> 39:30.375
Fine. Come on.

39:30.458 --> 39:31.583
You can have some chicken.

39:31.667 --> 39:33.083
But be quiet.

39:33.166 --> 39:34.917
Tom and Della are in the back.

39:52.458 --> 39:53.625
What you doing?

39:53.709 --> 39:55.125
I'm good for it, man.
Come on, just--

39:55.208 --> 39:57.291
- Put it back.
- I'll pay you tomorrow, man.

39:57.375 --> 39:59.750
- I said put it back, Tre!
- 'What's going on?'

39:59.834 --> 40:01.625
What's going on out here?

40:02.875 --> 40:04.250
'No, Tre!'

40:04.333 --> 40:06.333
- Tre, what you doing, man?
- Don't be crazy, son.

40:06.417 --> 40:09.542
You step off!

40:09.625 --> 40:10.542
Just step off.

40:10.625 --> 40:11.875
Give me the gun, Tre.

40:15.792 --> 40:17.250
(Derek)
'Tre, what you doing, man?'

40:17.333 --> 40:19.792
- Oh my god.
- Tom!

40:19.875 --> 40:21.458
- Get back!
- Tre.

40:22.417 --> 40:23.667
Get back!

40:27.750 --> 40:28.834
Get 'em, man!

40:28.917 --> 40:30.417
Man, we gotta
call an ambulance.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.208
Grab 'em and put 'em
in the bathroom!

40:32.291 --> 40:33.542
Man, we gotta call
an ambulance.

40:33.625 --> 40:34.959
Grab the rope, Derek!

40:35.041 --> 40:36.208
(Derek)
'Tre, we got
to get them help!'

40:36.291 --> 40:38.375
No!

40:38.458 --> 40:41.291
(Tre)
'Help me, Derek!'

40:41.375 --> 40:43.125
Help me, man!

40:48.000 --> 40:50.667
(Tre)
'You and me, look,
we'll start over.'

40:50.750 --> 40:53.458
We'll take the cash and
everything will be okay.

40:53.542 --> 40:55.125
What'd you do, Tre?

40:56.417 --> 40:57.500
This is my family!

40:57.583 --> 40:59.834
No, I'm your family.

40:59.917 --> 41:01.458
I'm blood, man!

41:01.542 --> 41:02.500
This is right.

41:02.583 --> 41:03.875
This is a plan.

41:05.125 --> 41:06.750
We'll go away.

41:06.834 --> 41:07.875
We need to get her help.

41:07.959 --> 41:09.041
No, it'll work.

41:09.125 --> 41:10.250
She's alive, Tre!

41:10.333 --> 41:12.083
She ain't your family!

41:12.166 --> 41:13.834
But it's Della!

41:13.917 --> 41:15.125
I'm your family!

41:17.875 --> 41:19.333
You got it now?

41:25.500 --> 41:26.959
I'm calling for help.

41:29.959 --> 41:30.959
No. No.

41:31.041 --> 41:32.792
'Don't make me
hurt you, Derek.'

41:35.834 --> 41:37.375
No.

41:38.625 --> 41:41.709
You're not gonna shoot me.

41:41.792 --> 41:43.458
I'm your brother!

41:45.667 --> 41:47.166
I love you.

41:48.333 --> 41:49.750
I mean it, Derek!

41:51.000 --> 41:52.583
I'm getting you some help.
