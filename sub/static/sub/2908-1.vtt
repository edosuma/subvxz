she chokes on your dick!</i>

00:50.720 --> 00:52.643
<i>Well, at least she
gets close to it!</i>

00:52.720 --> 00:55.246
<i>I hate you!</i>

00:55.320 --> 00:58.244
<i>Oh, what a filthy,
fat mouth you've got!</i>

00:58.320 --> 01:00.322

<i>HUGH: She couldn't be bothered
to make a cake, she bought it.</i>

<i>I'll call the police again.</i>

01:05.280 --> 01:06.486

the goddamn candles.</i>

<i>Stop the madness.</i>

01:30.800 --> 01:32.643
<i>It did not come true.</i>

01:32.720 --> 01:36.008
It's up to you, son.
Who do you want to live with?

01:37.840 --> 01:38.921
Six months till Christmas!

01:46.520 --> 01:50.002
I hate to be the one to tell you,
sweetie, but Daddy's a homosexual.

01:50.080 --> 01:54.130
<i>NARRATOR: Pressured into unnatural
and awkward relationships.</i>

01:54.200 --> 01:57.727

It's just you and me forever.

02:08.240 --> 02:10.971
<i>NARRATOR: This young man
was eager to grow up.</i>

02:11.039 --> 02:14.522
<i>To be free of these people
who called themselves parents.</i>

02:14.600 --> 02:18.446
<i>And for a while, he did a pretty
good job at convincing the world</i>

02:18.520 --> 02:20.329
<i>he'd done just that.</i>

02:37.160 --> 02:39.003
Please, can we not hire
any more actresses,

02:39.080 --> 02:41.208
no matter how much
waiting experience they have.

02:41.280 --> 02:44.011
- Hey, Etta, how's your husband?
- Not dead yet.

02:44.560 --> 02:46.767
Why don't you just slide
29 over to 30?

02:46.840 --> 02:48.683
Because I have a
birthday party at 30.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.330
- How about 15?
- Fifteen is good.

02:50.440 --> 02:53.046
Oh, by the way, your brother called.
He's such a flirt.

02:53.120 --> 02:54.929
- Hello, sir. How are you?
- Hi.

02:55.680 --> 02:58.081
That table finished their dessert,
paid their bill

02:58.160 --> 02:59.525
and they've been sitting there
for a half-hour!

02:59.600 --> 03:02.365
We're actually setting
a new table for you right now.

03:02.440 --> 03:05.125
- Good.
- Okay? Thank you. I'm so sorry.

03:05.840 --> 03:06.966
(PHONE RINGING)

03:07.120 --> 03:08.849
- Word up.
- Thank you.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.007
We're slammed, Trey, talk fast.

03:12.760 --> 03:17.004
Well, I don't have anywhere to sit,
so tell me while I'm standing.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.127
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Look!

03:24.520 --> 03:26.090
- Whoa! Really?
- I know!

03:26.600 --> 03:28.045
I think you mean "congratulations"?

03:28.120 --> 03:30.361
Yes. Congratulations.

03:30.480 --> 03:32.562
The phone hasn't stopped.
One sec.

03:32.840 --> 03:34.205
Hi, Mom!

03:36.880 --> 03:39.850
I know!
I'm so excited.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.046
Wanna get high?

03:41.120 --> 03:45.364
No, I don't wanna get high.
Married?

03:45.440 --> 03:48.410
- What's it been? Three or four months?
- Holy shit, yeah, it has been.

03:48.480 --> 03:50.164
- Yeah.
- it's been like four months!

03:50.240 --> 03:53.801
Yeah. That's a huge decision.

03:53.920 --> 03:55.570
Honestly, I just came up
with it yesterday.

03:55.640 --> 03:56.971
We were at Costco

03:57.040 --> 04:01.090
and she made the fucking funniest
joke about this DVD display

04:01.160 --> 04:02.400
and I just thought
this is the girl

04:02.480 --> 04:04.562
I want to spend the rest
of my life with, you know?

04:04.680 --> 04:06.762
(STAMMERING) That's great.

04:06.840 --> 04:10.447
Are you sure you're ready for this, man?
I mean, you kind of...

04:10.560 --> 04:12.722
You live in my garage, Trey.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.167
And you don't have
a checkbook.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.089
It just feels right.

04:20.360 --> 04:23.330
- Okay. That's great.
- Thanks, man.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.524
TREY: You're not gonna want to do this,
but could you talk to Mom and Dad?

04:26.600 --> 04:29.080
- About?
- Coming to a wedding.

04:29.440 --> 04:31.761
(BOTH LAUGHING)

04:32.360 --> 04:35.443
You're not having a wedding.
Just do a small thing at City Hall.

04:35.520 --> 04:36.567
One witness, no hassle.

04:36.640 --> 04:40.326
I mean, isn't there some sort of
traditional Japanese thing you can do?

04:41.080 --> 04:44.050
- She's from Palo Alto.
- I know. But like the old country?

04:44.120 --> 04:45.610
She's third generation.

04:45.720 --> 04:49.008
Trey, Mom and Dad
haven't spoken in 20 years.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.971
I know, but if anybody could
get them to, it's you.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.166
They listen to you.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.447
They don't really.
I mean, I patronize them, so...

04:56.520 --> 04:59.251
Look, things have
been pretty good.

04:59.360 --> 05:01.249
We're in a period
of real calm here.

05:01.360 --> 05:03.567
You sure you want
to take that risk?

05:05.040 --> 05:06.246
It's my wedding.

05:09.240 --> 05:11.766
Please. I mean, if there was ever
going to be a day...

05:13.200 --> 05:14.281
Okay. I'll give it a shot.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.725
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

05:16.800 --> 05:18.564
- Oh!
- Okay.

05:19.680 --> 05:20.966
- You're the man.
- Okay.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.681
You are the Best Man.
You get it?

05:25.480 --> 05:26.811
Thanks a lot.

05:27.680 --> 05:29.170
He said okay!

05:31.240 --> 05:32.605
CARTER: All right, guys,
who's going to go higher?

05:32.680 --> 05:33.886
- Me.
- Okay.

05:33.960 --> 05:37.043
Oh, my God, it's so scary.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.885
Don't tell your mom I'm giving you
these, there's no actual juice in them.

05:40.120 --> 05:41.724
(HORN HONKING)

05:42.880 --> 05:45.451
Look who's here. Okay, one,
two, three. Oh, my gosh.

05:48.280 --> 05:51.124
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

05:51.800 --> 05:54.121
Oh, guys, come on.
Whoa!

05:55.640 --> 06:00.362
Hey. How was Rancho De La...
Wherever it was you went?

06:00.440 --> 06:03.091
Oh, it's the greatest. It's a
first-class joint. I had a manicure.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.366
I can see from here.

06:04.440 --> 06:05.487
Bring me my babies.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.210
Mommy! Mommy!

06:07.280 --> 06:09.282
Hi. How were they?

06:10.040 --> 06:11.121
They were good.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.966
Pretty interesting park, though.
A lot of sharp right angles.

06:15.320 --> 06:18.051
This is a very important park.
Do you know I. M. Pei?

06:19.120 --> 06:20.565
His brother comes here.

06:21.240 --> 06:24.562
Carter, I got you something.
These are the greatest hats.

06:24.640 --> 06:26.085
Yeah, the greatest.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.527
- Put it on.
- I will. I just...

06:28.600 --> 06:32.047
Come on, put it on. I wanna see
what it looks like on your head.

06:32.160 --> 06:33.321
HUGH: Carter, on.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.171
Terrific.

06:38.160 --> 06:41.960
- I nailed it.
- SONDRA: it looks great on you.

06:42.040 --> 06:44.168
Hey, Dad,
did you happen to talk to Trey?

06:44.240 --> 06:47.562
Great news, huh?
How about that kid?

06:48.120 --> 06:50.009
Well, he wants to
have a wedding.

06:50.080 --> 06:53.129
Terrific. I told him,
whatever he wants.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.409
Come on, forget the family
of the bride pays for this or that.

06:56.520 --> 06:59.126
It's me, because I might
only do this once.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.484
So you'll go to a wedding
if Mom is there?

07:03.160 --> 07:04.161
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

07:05.840 --> 07:08.161
No. She can have
her own wedding.

07:08.440 --> 07:11.284
Right. But we're probably
not going to have two weddings.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.361
Why not?

07:12.840 --> 07:14.649
I'm gonna throw
a first-class party,

07:14.720 --> 07:16.688
and then your mother
and Captain Fuckface

07:16.760 --> 07:19.286
can rent out a
KFC in Petersburg.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.567
They can charge admission
to cover the fucking cost.

07:21.640 --> 07:25.531
Dad, I'm not asking you to dance
with her. Just be in the same room.

07:28.600 --> 07:30.364
- Carter.
- Dad.

07:30.440 --> 07:33.523
If I ever see that woman,
I'm going to kick her in the balls.

07:36.480 --> 07:39.609
<i>MELISSA: It's just something every
parent dreams of, their child's wedding.</i>

07:39.680 --> 07:41.762
Yeah, I think it's wonderful.
I do.

07:41.840 --> 07:44.810
Yeah, me, too. It's just...
I don't know, it's too bad.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.530
What is?

07:46.600 --> 07:49.001
Oh, it's just too bad
they have to elope.

07:49.080 --> 07:50.969
What? No, no! Absolutely not.

07:51.040 --> 07:52.804
Well, Trey doesn't
have a choice, Mom.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.850
I mean, unless you and Dad
will show up at the same wedding.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.840
I'll elope with them.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.082
Mom, if you go,
it's not an elopement.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.208
- GARY: It's a destination wedding.
- That's right.

08:02.280 --> 08:04.203
And, plus, Dad has to
go and Sondra.

08:04.280 --> 08:05.441
No,no,no,no!

08:05.520 --> 08:07.568
The Cuntessa is not coming
to San Martin.

08:07.640 --> 08:11.281
GARY: Melissa? Will you grab that
penlight in the kitchen drawer for me?

08:11.560 --> 08:15.042
(WHISPERING) He's losing his mind.
Tie it to yourself.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.880
She usually calms down
in 10 to 15 seconds.

08:23.960 --> 08:25.041
Thanks, Gary.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.442
Found it. Sorry.

08:27.520 --> 08:30.524
You know what? I'll go to a
wedding with your father.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.160
- You will?
- Mmm-hmm.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.681
As soon as he pays me
that $485,000 he owes me

08:34.760 --> 08:35.966
for my share of the lake house.

08:36.080 --> 08:38.162
Larry Ellis was waterskiing
there last weekend

08:38.240 --> 08:40.368
and he saw a light on.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.602
Is your father using it?
You know he's not allowed to use it.

08:42.679 --> 08:44.489
Mom, no one's been
there in 20 years.

08:44.560 --> 08:46.961
Because he's renting it!
He's renting it!

08:47.440 --> 08:49.966
Anything he earns on that house,
I get half.

08:50.040 --> 08:52.850
That's in the settlement agreement.
That's how that works.

08:52.920 --> 08:56.367
You know your father's refusing to put it
on the market just to spite me?

08:56.440 --> 08:58.647
That means your father
is stealing from your mother.

08:58.720 --> 09:00.051
That must really bother you.

09:00.120 --> 09:02.202
- I don't...
- How does it not bother you?

09:02.280 --> 09:03.725
No, it doesn't seem to.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.121
Please tell me
you are not your father's son!

09:06.200 --> 09:07.247
What?

09:19.240 --> 09:20.480
Hey.

09:21.360 --> 09:24.125
So here's a bit of news.
Kieko called me.

09:25.560 --> 09:26.686
Oh
yeah?

09:26.760 --> 09:29.445
Yeah. She asked me to be
a bridesmaid. Straighten your back.

09:29.520 --> 09:30.646
Hmm.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.165
I didn't even know
they were getting married.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.447
Yeah, I was going to
tell you about that.

09:35.080 --> 09:38.004
Trey and Kieko have been together,
what, four months?

09:38.720 --> 09:40.131
Yeah, something like that.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.444
And we've been
together how long?

09:43.640 --> 09:46.928
Well, that's kind of apples and
oranges, if you think about it.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.525
It's four years.

09:49.160 --> 09:52.130
Four years. And I don't even have
a key to your apartment.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.451
Look, I've been patient.
Really.

09:56.520 --> 09:58.204
But how long do you
expect me to wait?

10:01.240 --> 10:02.241
Um...

10:03.960 --> 10:06.611
- Oh, my God.
- I totally had you!

10:06.680 --> 10:08.569
- You did. Yeah.
- I had you for a minute.

10:08.640 --> 10:10.563
Jesus.

10:10.640 --> 10:12.404
I'm really excited.
I think it's going to be great.

10:12.480 --> 10:17.122
All right, get up. All right, everybody!
Gloves on, hands up.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.889
They should be $6,
because they are fresh.

10:22.520 --> 10:23.965
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.085
Your mom called.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.245
Okay, thanks.

10:28.320 --> 10:29.731
Four times.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.125
Right.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.010
And your dad called, too.
Twice.

10:36.280 --> 10:38.328
And we're off.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.329
<i>MELISSA: (ON VOICEMAIL)
Carter, it's Mom. I've been thinking,</i>

10:43.400 --> 10:45.721
<i>what about a surprise
wedding for Trey?</i>

10:45.800 --> 10:47.529
<i>Your father doesn't even
have to know about it.</i>

10:47.600 --> 10:49.807

Carter, listen, bottom line,</i>

10:49.880 --> 10:51.564
<i>if I'm paying she can't come.</i>

10:51.640 --> 10:53.529
<i>She's been suckling at my teat
for way too long.</i>

with a boat.</i>

10:56.120 --> 10:57.610
<i>It's a barge.
It is big!</i>

10:59.120 --> 11:02.010

<i>MELISSA: (ON VOICEMAIL)
Okay, I talked to the boat guy.</i>

11:03.680 --> 11:05.569
<i>His name is Yuri,
he's a Russian gentleman...</i>

(RINGS DOORBELL)

11:40.320 --> 11:42.687
My God, Carter.

11:43.480 --> 11:45.847
Hi. Hey.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.691
I was just thrilled
to hear from you.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.888
- Come on in. This way.
- Thank you.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.442
Sorry it's such a mess,
I've been really busy.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.610
I'm lecturing here and there,
"The Modern Family Dynamic."

11:57.680 --> 12:01.605
And why don't you have a seat
right here. I'll move all this.

12:01.680 --> 12:05.002
- I just came back from Northwestern...
- That's great.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.487
...Louisiana State College.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.800
It's a junior college.

12:10.880 --> 12:14.168
Well, thank you for seeing me
on such short notice.

12:14.240 --> 12:17.369
I didn't want to have to explain
everything to someone new.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.090
Well, I haven't seen you
since you were 13, so...

12:19.160 --> 12:22.130
- Yeah, I know.
- So tell me about you.

12:22.200 --> 12:25.010
- What do you do?
- Well, I have a restaurant.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.320
Whitegrass.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.481
- On Temple Street?
- Yeah.

12:27.600 --> 12:28.806
- I've eaten there!
- Great.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.405
I didn't love it,
but I'd try it again.

12:30.520 --> 12:31.851
All right.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.888
And how is your mom?
I always liked her.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.122
- You did?
- Yeah. Very assertive woman.

12:36.200 --> 12:40.603
And your dad, he has a new wife.
Something Nordic? Thor?

12:40.680 --> 12:42.091
- Elka.
- Elka.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.685
Oh, no, no, no.
Elka's gone.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.286
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I didn't know that.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.727
Oh, no, she didn't die.
She just aged.

12:48.800 --> 12:51.167
On to wife number three.

12:51.240 --> 12:54.961
Yeah, Sondra.
Not my cup of anything.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.281
But she does own the building
that my restaurant's in,

12:57.360 --> 12:58.441
so I get a sweet deal on rent.

12:58.520 --> 13:02.889
Oh, good.
So tell me, what brings you here?

13:02.960 --> 13:05.327
Well, my brother is
getting married.

13:05.400 --> 13:06.811
Oh, I love weddings.

13:06.880 --> 13:10.327
And my parents
are being a nightmare already.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.129
And I've kind of forged
this fragile peace between them.

13:14.200 --> 13:15.326
"A fragile peace"?

13:15.440 --> 13:17.602
They always made
a mess of everything.

13:17.680 --> 13:21.082
Like all holidays,
graduations, funerals.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.605
I remember the funeral incident.

13:22.680 --> 13:26.002
And I maintain that funerals need
to be about the person who died.

13:26.080 --> 13:28.242
Right. And I got smart.
And over the years,

13:28.320 --> 13:31.369
I've started coming up with ways
to avoid situations like this.

13:31.440 --> 13:34.091
Like Thanksgiving. Who am I going
to spend Thanksgiving with?

13:34.160 --> 13:37.642
Well, they think I'm in Honduras building
schools with the US Cares program.

13:37.720 --> 13:41.167
But little do they know, the US Cares
program doesn't exist, so...

13:41.240 --> 13:43.163
Oh. That sounds real.

13:43.240 --> 13:46.210
Yeah, I kind of got it
figured out, but...

13:47.040 --> 13:49.964
I don't know.
This wedding, it's risky.

13:50.040 --> 13:53.010
I guess I'm just looking for some advice.
Someone to talk to super quick,

13:53.080 --> 13:55.560
to figure out how to
survive the next few months.

13:55.640 --> 13:59.167
I can absolutely recommend somebody,
if I could find a pen.

13:59.240 --> 14:00.366
Yeah?

14:00.440 --> 14:05.162
Well, I thought you, just because
you know the whole backstory.

14:05.280 --> 14:06.850
But I'm not a therapist.

14:08.600 --> 14:09.806
But you were my therapist.

14:09.880 --> 14:13.168
Oh, no, no, no.
No. Is that what they told you?

14:13.240 --> 14:14.480
- No.
- Yeah.

14:14.560 --> 14:18.565
I saw you as part of a state-funded study
of the effects of divorce on children.

14:18.640 --> 14:20.961
Your mother was referred to me
by the courts

14:21.040 --> 14:23.122
because of the nature
of your parents' divorce.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.887
- Oh.
- I wrote a book about it.

14:25.960 --> 14:28.770
It was on <i>The New York Times</i>
Best Seller list for 38 weeks.

14:28.960 --> 14:29.961
Oh?

14:30.040 --> 14:31.804
It's in its 14th printing.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.647
Margot Kidder did the audio book!

14:37.400 --> 14:38.970
What was the name
of that book again?

14:57.360 --> 14:58.885
Well, fuck me.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.045
CARTER: Do you think
I walk around like a victim?

15:25.120 --> 15:26.770
I don't think I walk
around like a victim.

15:26.840 --> 15:28.729
Do you think I'm
a negotiator?

15:28.800 --> 15:30.609
Like I'm constantly
trying to keep the peace,

15:30.680 --> 15:32.364
even if there's no
peace to be kept?

15:32.440 --> 15:35.523
I mean, that's actually
written in a sentence.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.887
I mean, that's just bad sentence
construction, in my opinion.

15:37.960 --> 15:43.251
Am I living in a shell of insecurity
and approval-seeking?

15:44.040 --> 15:45.166
I don't know.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.326
You know what?

15:48.960 --> 15:50.769
Thank you for this.

15:57.400 --> 15:58.686
(SIGHS)

16:03.680 --> 16:05.967
- Hi.
- Mom.

16:06.040 --> 16:07.041
Hi.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.401
People are going to think
you're my boy toy.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.721
Don't say that.
Shall we?

16:14.440 --> 16:17.523
It's better for you
at room temperature.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.129
So, I brought you something.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.248
Huh.
Yeah, I remember that book.

16:34.320 --> 16:35.970
It's funny, I don't.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.242
You don't?
Well, you should keep it.

16:38.320 --> 16:40.129
- So...
- Mom.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.364
- What?
- Why?

16:42.480 --> 16:45.802
Your father was running around

16:45.880 --> 16:48.360
with every 25-year-old
coat check girl in the city.

16:48.440 --> 16:49.805
Mom.

16:49.880 --> 16:51.848
And you really needed
to talk to somebody.

16:51.920 --> 16:54.048
Relax. She didn't use
your real name.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.441
You were like Robert or something.

16:56.520 --> 16:57.851
- Rob.
- it's Rick.

16:57.920 --> 16:59.684
- Rick!
- Rick.

17:00.600 --> 17:01.601
So you read it?

17:01.720 --> 17:04.769
According to this,
Rick is a total disaster.

17:05.599 --> 17:08.365
You do realize that Rick
now owns a successful business

17:08.440 --> 17:10.920
and has employees
who come to him with their problems.

17:11.319 --> 17:13.321
- Mmm-hmm.
- Rick has a beautiful girlfriend

17:13.400 --> 17:16.131
- whom he loves.
- Mmm-hmm.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.726
Carter, please tell me this book is
not the reason you brought me here.

17:19.280 --> 17:20.724
Oh, no. It's not.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.926
Put that on a good hanger
for me, will you.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.409
All of our hangers
are quite good, sir.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.084
Ha, that's cute.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.041
MAITRE D:
Right this way, sir.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.327
I pulled the big gun out tonight.

17:36.400 --> 17:37.765
Having dinner with my son.

17:37.840 --> 17:40.525
Mmm, crab.
You know they self-amputate?

17:45.440 --> 17:47.090
Hey, buddy. Look.

17:49.240 --> 17:50.241
Shit!

17:50.320 --> 17:51.845
- Shall I open the wine?
- No!

17:51.920 --> 17:53.490
Yes. Sit down.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.490
Sit, Dad.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.688
Forget it. I'll go.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.286
Fine.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.011
You leave, he wins.

18:06.040 --> 18:10.090
Right. You go. I cleared a very busy
evening to have dinner with my son.

18:11.280 --> 18:12.486
Like I didn't?

18:15.160 --> 18:16.571
(DISHES CLATTERING)

18:22.760 --> 18:25.923
You've destroyed this evening.
What have you done?

18:26.040 --> 18:27.804
This is ridiculous!

18:27.880 --> 18:29.769
Is it? I don't know.
Look around you.

18:29.840 --> 18:31.285
The building is still standing.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.567
You're both in the same room

18:33.640 --> 18:37.122
and somehow the universe
hasn't folded in on itself.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.771
Holy shit. Now, I brought
you both here tonight,

18:39.840 --> 18:41.763
because you've turned
a nine-year marriage

18:41.840 --> 18:43.888
into a hundred-year war.

18:44.640 --> 18:46.961
And I am officially over it.

18:48.040 --> 18:51.123
We're playing by new rules now.
Okay?

18:51.200 --> 18:53.885
Trey is getting married.
There is going to be a wedding.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.962
Now, you don't have to pay for it,
you don't have to organize it,

18:56.040 --> 19:00.602
you don't even have to enjoy it.
All you have to do is show up, be civil,

19:00.680 --> 19:04.605
and for one night,
just shut the fuck up.

19:04.680 --> 19:05.681
The drama.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.125
A pain in the ass, he is.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.328
On, my God. (STAMMERING)

19:09.400 --> 19:10.925
You actually agree
on something.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.480
That's fantastic.
This is a great start, you guys.

19:13.560 --> 19:17.281
You sit here, you talk.
You have a good time together.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.840
I ordered the tasting menu
and I paid for it,

19:20.560 --> 19:22.085
so bon appétit!

19:24.240 --> 19:28.529
Oh, and FYI,
I've never been to Honduras.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.120
Have you had your face done?

19:59.280 --> 20:02.966
I gotta tell you, what you did,
that took some balls.

20:03.040 --> 20:04.246
Well, thank you.

20:04.320 --> 20:08.211
Yeah, honestly, I should have
straightened them out years ago.

20:08.280 --> 20:11.204
- It felt good.
- All right. So, what's next?

20:11.280 --> 20:12.441
Well,

20:14.200 --> 20:16.726
full speed ahead.
You plan the wedding you want, Trey.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.689
- Awesome!
- Oh, by the way,

20:18.760 --> 20:20.683
we don't want Morn and Dad
paying for anything, so don't ask.

20:20.760 --> 20:23.445
- Okay.
- Can Kieko's family help out?

20:23.520 --> 20:24.567
- Um...
- Because I'd be happy

20:24.640 --> 20:26.244
to chip in, as well.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.402
- Really?
- Yeah, of course.

20:28.480 --> 20:33.042
(STAMMERING) Dude,
I can't thank you enough.

20:33.120 --> 20:36.806
I mean it. Just for all of it.

20:37.720 --> 20:41.441
Well, it's how it should be.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.370
This stuff, it's...

20:46.680 --> 20:49.206
it doesn't have to be so
complicated, does it?

20:50.200 --> 20:53.682
All I'm saying is don't leave the
classroom without putting shorts on

20:53.760 --> 20:55.489
over those shorts.
Okay?

21:01.640 --> 21:04.928
Hey, so do male strippers
work here or...

21:05.000 --> 21:07.765
Ah, that's Herve,
the French spinning instructor.

21:07.840 --> 21:10.764
Herve? Aren't the French
supposed to be about

21:10.840 --> 21:12.842
leaving a little something
to the imagination?

21:13.360 --> 21:14.850
What's with the surprise visit?

21:14.960 --> 21:19.966
Oh, well, I got you a little something.
I think you might like it.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.802
Oh, my God.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.850
No! No, no.

21:27.920 --> 21:29.968
Oh, my God, Carter.

21:30.640 --> 21:31.926
No, no.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.884
I'm sorry, it's a...
This is a...

21:34.960 --> 21:36.610
It's just a key.

21:36.680 --> 21:37.886
It's a key?
Oh, my God.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.086
It's just a key.

21:40.720 --> 21:43.485
I mean, you said you wanted
a key for my apartment.

21:43.560 --> 21:45.289
Right, right, right.

21:45.360 --> 21:48.045
- Right! You scared me.
- Sorry.

21:48.640 --> 21:49.721
It's an antique chain.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.485
- It's really nice.
- Do you see the beads?

22:00.440 --> 22:01.521
What's that?

22:02.880 --> 22:05.565
Your step-mom sent this over
with instructions to hang it.

22:06.040 --> 22:07.929
- What is it?
- it's her painting.

22:08.000 --> 22:09.001
She paints?

22:09.080 --> 22:12.163
- Apparently, yes.
- Okay. Take it down.

22:12.240 --> 22:14.242
Oh, no. I can't.

22:14.320 --> 22:17.085
She threatened to sell the place
to Dunkin' Donuts if we did that.

22:21.760 --> 22:24.331
Is that Sondra? What do you
think she's crying about?

22:24.400 --> 22:25.890
The painting she's in.

22:25.960 --> 22:28.281
- (KNOCKING ON WINDOW)
- Hi!

22:28.360 --> 22:30.488
The homeless are getting
so aggressive these days.

22:30.560 --> 22:31.721
What the hell?

22:34.400 --> 22:37.847
- Hello.
- Hi! Whitegrass. Is that Indian?

22:37.960 --> 22:39.007
No.

22:39.080 --> 22:42.846
Is it the healthy drink
that you have with ginger sometimes?

22:42.920 --> 22:44.809
- That's wheatgrass.
- Oh, yeah.

22:46.280 --> 22:49.807
- That's so funny.
- So what are you doing here?

22:49.880 --> 22:53.089
Yeah, well, listen.
I realized something

22:53.160 --> 22:55.686
after you left the other day
and I had to tell you.

22:56.640 --> 22:59.450
Oh, thank you. No, it's fine.
Yeah, I'm fine.

22:59.520 --> 23:01.170
It turns out seeing you

23:02.720 --> 23:05.246
and seeing your book,
it kind of got me going.

23:05.360 --> 23:07.522
And I confronted my parents,
and set them straight

23:07.600 --> 23:09.568
and showed them
who's boss.

23:09.640 --> 23:10.846
Really?

23:11.480 --> 23:14.324
Yeah, really.
I'm great, actually. So...

23:15.640 --> 23:17.642
Definitely not that
kid from your book.

23:17.720 --> 23:18.721
Well, of course you aren't.

23:18.800 --> 23:21.690
You were a kid back then.
Which got me to thinking.

23:22.320 --> 23:25.369
There's no current research
about people like you.

23:25.440 --> 23:27.249

A sequel.

23:36.640 --> 23:40.690
A 20-year study of a generation
unique to the American landscape.

23:40.760 --> 23:44.003
Carter, do you realize
you were the least parented,

23:44.080 --> 23:47.323
least nurtured generation ever?

23:47.400 --> 23:49.801
Sorry. I'm going
to be in another book?

23:49.880 --> 23:50.927
- Yes.
- No.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.570
- Oh, yes.
- No, no, no, no, no.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.608
- What are you afraid of?
- I'm not afraid of anything.

23:54.680 --> 23:55.841
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)
- I can assure you of that.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.207
Carter, listen to me.
When you were a little boy,

23:58.280 --> 24:00.408
your parents turned to you
for emotional support.

24:00.480 --> 24:02.767
They thrust you
into the center of their divorce.

24:02.840 --> 24:05.446
In my book,
I called it "parentification."

24:05.520 --> 24:09.525
But look at you now, as an adult.
You're well-adjusted,

24:09.600 --> 24:12.080
you're successful,
you're responsible.

24:12.160 --> 24:13.446
Look, you're the owner
of the Wheatgrass.

24:13.520 --> 24:14.760
Whitegrass.

24:14.840 --> 24:17.605
You're dressing sharp,
you have a great haircut.

24:17.680 --> 24:20.081
I want to tell that story, Carter.

24:21.360 --> 24:24.489
- It is a better story.
- Infinitely. It's inspiring.

24:24.560 --> 24:26.961
I can set the record straight
about "Rick"?

24:27.040 --> 24:31.170
Now, I'm free most days, but Friday
at 1:00 is really good for me.

24:31.280 --> 24:32.850
- How about you?
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)

24:32.920 --> 24:35.571

- Sure.

the father-son retreat going?

24:40.520 --> 24:41.726
Um, what?

24:47.480 --> 24:50.086
I'm at my sorority
reunion at Cornell.

24:50.880 --> 24:52.211
You went to Cornell?

24:52.280 --> 24:54.089
Shocking, Carter.
Put your father on.

Well, go get him.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.561
I... I can't.

25:12.640 --> 25:13.846
Just yell his name.

- My chef. He just needs peppers...

the whole day on Friday?

25:36.520 --> 25:37.521
Okay.

25:37.640 --> 25:40.246

- I know.

Are you sure
that's what they were doing?

28:15.600 --> 28:17.170
I saw my dad's butt.

28:18.520 --> 28:20.887
- How?
- it was moving.

28:20.960 --> 28:24.282
Look, she'd never been there before.
He had to give her directions.

28:24.360 --> 28:25.691
They talked on the phone,

28:25.760 --> 28:29.401

Or some disgusting thing.

KIEKO: I have three.

28:44.480 --> 28:48.201
So we'll put Yoshi, Nakata,

KIEKO: Um, Yoshi's in jail.
TREY: Seriously?

28:50.920 --> 28:52.684

We don't keep in touch.

We're mocking up seating charts
for the reception.

29:05.080 --> 29:07.162
Okay, so, originally,

29:07.240 --> 29:09.481
we had thought we would
have Mom's table over here,

29:09.600 --> 29:13.400
and Dad's table way over here, and then
this is three generations of Kobayashis.

29:13.520 --> 29:16.091
Yellow was the only other
color we had.

(LAUGHING)
What are the odds?

29:19.840 --> 29:23.242
But thanks to your handiwork,
we had thought maybe

29:23.320 --> 29:27.325
we could have Mom and Dad's tables,
next to each other or...

29:27.440 --> 29:28.771
A family table?

29:28.840 --> 29:30.569

parents all sit together?

29:30.640 --> 29:31.801
No.

29:31.880 --> 29:34.121
Well, no, it's okay.
We're gonna do a dry run first,

29:34.200 --> 29:36.646
because her parents want to meet Mom
and Dad before the wedding anyway.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.290
- No.
- I mean, it won't be a big deal.

29:38.360 --> 29:41.125
Not a big dinner.
Just tea or something.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.521
No, no, look, Mom and Dad
should go here and here,

29:43.600 --> 29:46.126
and they are not to interact
in any capacity at any time.

29:46.200 --> 29:48.202
Do you understand?

29:49.720 --> 29:52.166
Okay, look, Lauren and
I will go to tea, okay?

29:52.240 --> 29:53.287
She likes tea.

29:53.360 --> 29:55.966

oolong and all that bullshit, okay?

at this stuff,

34:30.600 --> 34:32.364
It's like people doing cocaine
in the kitchen

34:32.440 --> 34:35.330
and people doing cocaine
at the front of the house,

34:35.400 --> 34:37.641
and, man, there was
a lot of cocaine.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.762
People just love cocaine.

34:39.840 --> 34:42.241
So I always thought if I had
my own place, I could do it better.

34:42.320 --> 34:43.924
Bring in my own people and...

34:44.000 --> 34:45.570
Your own little family.

34:45.679 --> 34:46.920
Yeah, except I could fire
the ones I didn't like.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.650
That's good.

34:49.840 --> 34:53.367
You said you had a girlfriend.
Her name is Lauren? Tell me about her.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.091
Lauren and I have a great thing.

34:56.159 --> 34:58.447
We never fight and there's no chaos,

34:58.520 --> 35:03.287
and she's really
even and fun.

35:03.360 --> 35:05.601
- But?
- I didn't say "but."

35:05.680 --> 35:08.524
You didn't say the word, okay?
Don't pick nits with me, all right?

35:08.600 --> 35:12.400
This isn't gonna work if you're
picking at everything I say.

35:12.480 --> 35:13.527
But?

35:14.600 --> 35:19.367
I mean, she's not always realistic
about how families really work.

35:19.440 --> 35:22.091
I mean, her parents have
been married for, like, 35 years

35:22.200 --> 35:23.611
(WHISTLES)

35:23.720 --> 35:25.927
and they celebrate every anniversary
with a party.

35:26.040 --> 35:27.929
Have you ever been
to a 34th anniversary?

35:28.000 --> 35:29.047
No.

35:29.120 --> 35:30.770
It's a lot like a 33rd.

35:30.840 --> 35:33.525
So, where do you see your
relationship with Lauren going?

35:34.000 --> 35:36.526
My brother jumped in,
and my parents,

35:36.600 --> 35:38.807
I mean, they spent their whole lives
being hasty and irrational.

35:38.880 --> 35:41.121
So you're afraid of making
the same mistakes your parents made.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.241
No. No.

35:42.320 --> 35:43.970
I'm gonna call that
"echoing." Echoing.

35:44.040 --> 35:45.530
- Don't write that down.
- I love it.

35:45.600 --> 35:46.647
No, it's not echoing.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.688
- I'm writing the book.
- I'm sorry?

35:48.760 --> 35:50.524
Okay, so I'll decide if
echoing is in the book or not.

35:50.600 --> 35:53.126
And I just coined a new term,
and I think it's clever.

35:53.200 --> 35:54.645
I got what I needed.
Thank you.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.927
And I'll see you next week.
This is great.

36:06.600 --> 36:07.840
(SIGHS)

36:13.440 --> 36:14.771
How'd it go?

36:16.800 --> 36:19.326
It was... What?

36:19.960 --> 36:21.291
Did she make you cry?

36:21.400 --> 36:22.447
No.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.125
Oh, are you...

36:26.120 --> 36:28.441
You must be Claire.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.803
Or Marcy.

36:32.640 --> 36:33.687
Why not Yvette?

36:34.680 --> 36:37.490
Well, I don't know.
I always pictured Yvette black.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.881
Because her father ran off
with her basketball coach?

36:39.960 --> 36:41.769
- A little racist.
- Yep.

36:43.600 --> 36:47.650
You have got to be Rick.

36:48.360 --> 36:51.728
I'm not. I'm not Rick.

36:51.800 --> 36:52.961
You're totally Rick.

36:53.040 --> 36:55.486
I am totally not Rick.
I'm Kevin.

36:55.560 --> 36:56.891
Kevin dropped out of high school,

36:56.960 --> 37:00.009
became a devout Muslim,
and moved to Pakistan.

37:00.080 --> 37:03.527
Exactly. Yeah, I just got back
from my pilgrimage two weeks ago,

37:03.600 --> 37:08.322
and just figuring it all out,
trying out this sweater.

37:08.440 --> 37:09.930
It feels good.

37:10.040 --> 37:12.168
Got to shave my beard,
so that feels good.

37:13.360 --> 37:15.727
Did the cops really show up
on your ninth birthday?

37:15.800 --> 37:17.404
Yeah, but it wasn't a big deal.

37:17.480 --> 37:18.641
Liar.

37:23.320 --> 37:25.209
I got to get in there.

37:26.840 --> 37:29.684
I'm gonna start off with
a little incest anecdote.

37:29.760 --> 37:32.570
Just to throw her off her game.

37:33.920 --> 37:35.843
Catch you later, Rick.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.685
Hey, do you think Glen
should wear a tux?

37:44.760 --> 37:45.761
Who?

37:45.840 --> 37:46.841
Gary's son, Glen.

37:46.920 --> 37:48.365
I asked him to officiate
the wedding.

37:49.520 --> 37:50.487
You what?

37:50.560 --> 37:52.801
Yeah, I mean, I just figured
it's the least I could do.

37:52.880 --> 37:54.803
Since Gary's been so generous.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.723
Glen lives in Alaska, Trey.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.644
I know, but he's a
pastor or a deacon.

37:59.720 --> 38:01.131
Captain of a fishing boat.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.168
Right, so he can marry people.

38:03.240 --> 38:04.605
Yeah, on a boat.

38:04.680 --> 38:07.001
Yeah, maritime law.
He can marry us.

38:07.080 --> 38:08.809
You've never even met him.

38:08.880 --> 38:12.362
Well, I know, but he's family. This will
be a good way to get to know him.

38:13.040 --> 38:15.008
The more, the merrier.

38:15.080 --> 38:16.366
I'm done.

38:17.200 --> 38:20.488
All right. We look like
a couple of riverboat gamblers,

38:20.560 --> 38:22.642
like Burt Reynolds, huh?
(CLAPS)

38:22.720 --> 38:24.051
You're up, buddy.

38:25.560 --> 38:27.130
- Get in there.
- Stop.

38:29.560 --> 38:33.690
This whole marriage thing
is easy for you.

38:34.680 --> 38:37.570
Well, you've seen Kieko.
She's smoking hot.

38:37.640 --> 38:40.803
And when she gets pregnant,
she's gonna stay hot,

38:40.920 --> 38:43.491
because Japanese women
carry it all in their bellies.

38:43.560 --> 38:46.325
There might be a little spillover
to the boobs, but that's it.

38:47.000 --> 38:50.686
You shouldn't share that theory
with anyone.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.762
- She knows it.
- Just...

38:52.840 --> 38:56.606
Dad was supposed to be
here a half hour ago.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.444
TREY: Hey, it's Trey.
Is my dad around?

39:01.080 --> 39:02.809
Really? Okay.

39:08.280 --> 39:10.647
- What's wrong?
- He's been at a tux fitting all morning.

39:12.040 --> 39:13.371
Try Mom.

39:13.440 --> 39:15.363
Call her at the office.

39:16.760 --> 39:19.331
TREY: Hey, Lorraine, it's Trey.
ls Mom there?

39:20.120 --> 39:22.202
Oh, wow,
Pilates again.

39:22.280 --> 39:24.282
Okay, thanks anyway. Bye.

39:24.960 --> 39:26.291
Shit.

39:26.360 --> 39:29.011
I mean, do you have any idea
how long a Pilates class lasts?

39:29.080 --> 39:31.321
It's like an hour.
Maybe an hour and a half.

39:31.400 --> 39:33.528
And my mom has been gone
for three hours.

39:33.640 --> 39:34.801
Is that not weird to you?

39:34.880 --> 39:37.724
Does that not raise any
red flags whatsoever?

39:37.800 --> 39:39.802
Things are slow.

39:39.880 --> 39:41.484
Our industry's dying.

39:46.560 --> 39:48.369
Shit! No!

39:48.440 --> 39:50.602
Down, down, down, down!

39:50.680 --> 39:51.966
Where are the stairs?

40:04.560 --> 40:06.324
What are you doing?

40:09.960 --> 40:11.644
(ENGINE STARTING)

40:13.440 --> 40:15.329
What are you gonna do?
Run me...

40:33.760 --> 40:34.841
Hey.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.605
What's this?

40:37.680 --> 40:38.647
Nothing.

40:38.720 --> 40:40.051
Why are you reading it?

40:41.800 --> 40:43.290
I wasn't.

40:43.360 --> 40:46.409
It's probably Trey's.
He's always leaving his crap around.

40:48.560 --> 40:49.971
These poor kids.

40:50.600 --> 40:52.523
One of them, he had
this awesome drum set,

40:52.600 --> 40:55.285
but his mom wouldn't let him play it,
because it was a gift from his dad.

40:55.360 --> 41:00.048
So it just sat in the garage unused,
like it was taunting him or something.

41:01.320 --> 41:02.890
Probably was.

41:06.840 --> 41:11.209
So, my brother is spearheading the
song this year for my parents' party.

41:12.400 --> 41:13.970
What anniversary is this?

41:14.040 --> 41:15.565
37.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.888
You should probably get up.

41:20.920 --> 41:22.285
You going somewhere?

41:24.080 --> 41:25.650
Tea with the Kobayashis.

41:25.720 --> 41:27.484
Oh, shit, that's tonight.

41:27.560 --> 41:30.643
(STAMMERING)
I'm not going.

41:30.720 --> 41:33.883
You dragged me into it.
I don't even like tea.

41:34.080 --> 41:35.081
(GONG RINGING)

41:35.160 --> 41:36.491
(LIQUID POURING)

41:36.560 --> 41:38.324
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

41:39.760 --> 41:41.922
Carter, it's a thrill
to finally meet you.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.321
Helping the kids with the wedding
the way you have,

41:44.400 --> 41:45.845
it's really above and beyond.

41:45.920 --> 41:48.161
Oh, well, what option
did I have, really?

41:48.240 --> 41:50.641
I love these two.
But who are we kidding?

41:50.720 --> 41:52.324
They're just a couple
bad decisions away

41:52.400 --> 41:55.210
from sleeping beneath an underpass,
am I right?

41:56.280 --> 41:59.011
Mrs. Kobayashi,
that necklace is incredible.

41:59.120 --> 42:00.167
Oh, I made it for her.

42:00.240 --> 42:01.207
Yes.

42:01.280 --> 42:02.441
She also made this for me.

42:02.520 --> 42:03.521
Kieko.

42:04.240 --> 42:05.571
TREY: I know, right?

42:05.640 --> 42:06.801
Room for one more in here?

42:07.400 --> 42:08.401
Dad?

42:09.000 --> 42:10.240
TREY: Oh, my gosh, you made it!

42:10.320 --> 42:11.367
HUGH: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:11.440 --> 42:13.363
Dad, this is Mr.
and Mrs. Kobayashi.

42:13.440 --> 42:14.851
Oh, hi, hi.

42:14.920 --> 42:16.046
Nice to meet you, too.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.248
You must be Ellen.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.883
Come, sit. Please.

42:20.960 --> 42:22.849
Hey, sweetheart.
Hi, you look beautiful.

42:23.400 --> 42:24.811
- Hi, guys.
- You made it.

42:24.880 --> 42:25.961
Hi.

42:28.080 --> 42:29.081
Oh!

42:29.960 --> 42:31.007
Classy joint.

42:33.880 --> 42:35.086
More tea!

42:36.120 --> 42:38.009
- Sorry I'm late.
- Mom?

42:39.680 --> 42:40.761
Hugh!

42:41.480 --> 42:42.641
What are you doing here?

42:42.720 --> 42:44.722
I should ask you,
what are you doing here?

42:45.720 --> 42:49.122
Trey called me and told me about
this very important meeting.

42:49.200 --> 42:51.202
He called me as well.

42:51.280 --> 42:53.044
I never thought you
would both show up.

42:53.120 --> 42:54.201
MELISSA:
As long as we're here...

42:54.280 --> 42:55.805
HUGH: Completely by coincidence.

42:55.880 --> 42:57.564
We may as well act maturely.

42:57.640 --> 43:00.564
I don't totally agree with you,
but you know what I'm going to do?

43:00.680 --> 43:03.081
I'm going to try to agree with
you more as time goes on,

43:03.160 --> 43:05.527
so that we can be more civil.

43:06.520 --> 43:08.124
Move it.

43:11.720 --> 43:13.529
What the hell?

43:15.960 --> 43:17.371
MELISSA:
Oh, come on.

43:18.600 --> 43:20.204
Food looks good here,
doesn't it?

43:25.280 --> 43:26.770
<i>Watashi wa</i> Melissa.

43:26.840 --> 43:28.649
Hello, I'm Gene.
Nice to meet you.

43:28.720 --> 43:31.200
Nice English.
Your turn.

43:31.280 --> 43:33.089
<i>Watashi wa</i> Melissa.

43:33.160 --> 43:34.730
Yes, my name is Ellen.

43:34.840 --> 43:36.524
What else can you say?

43:42.640 --> 43:43.926
(LAUGHING)

43:44.960 --> 43:46.121
Two, two and a half?

43:46.200 --> 43:47.201
Three.

43:47.280 --> 43:48.441
Three, right. All right, three.

43:48.560 --> 43:49.800
So Trey was crying
like a little girl.

43:49.920 --> 43:51.888
(LAUGHING)

43:52.320 --> 43:56.325
Trey was such a sensitive little
boy, terrified of everything.

43:56.400 --> 43:59.961
Oh, my Lord, spiders,
shoelaces, the mailman.

44:00.040 --> 44:01.280
Remember? Oh.

44:01.400 --> 44:04.324
I just picked him up, and I just
threw him in the fucking lake.

44:04.400 --> 44:05.890
Without the water wings.

44:05.960 --> 44:09.089
Because it's sink or swim time,
right, Trey, buddy?

44:10.200 --> 44:12.123
(IMITATES CHOKING)

44:12.240 --> 44:14.402
We saved at least $400
in swimming lessons.

44:14.480 --> 44:15.481
Ba-dump-bum.

44:15.560 --> 44:17.927
(LAUGHING)

44:18.040 --> 44:19.166
I don't even remember this.

44:19.360 --> 44:21.124
Yeah, because it was me.

44:22.880 --> 44:27.090
The water wings, that was me.
I was five. I almost drowned.

44:27.160 --> 44:28.207
It was hilarious.

44:28.280 --> 44:29.361
Super funny.

44:31.920 --> 44:34.321
What? By the time
Trey was old enough to swim,

44:34.440 --> 44:35.726
you guys weren't even
married anymore.

44:35.800 --> 44:37.723
You were way divorced.

44:38.840 --> 44:41.366
I guess just as divorced
as you are right now.

44:47.080 --> 44:48.320
- Well, let's eat.
- KIEKO: Good idea.

44:48.400 --> 44:49.606
TREY: Who wants sticky buns?
KIEKO: I do.

44:49.680 --> 44:52.001
You know what, actually,
I need to get some air.

44:53.280 --> 44:54.361
- (CLATTERS)
- Oh, God.

44:54.440 --> 44:55.441
(EXCLAIMING)

44:55.800 --> 44:57.370
I'm sorry.

44:57.440 --> 44:58.441
TREY:
Not cool, man.

44:58.520 --> 44:59.965
MRS. KOBAYASHI: That's all right.
It's okay. No, I...

45:02.960 --> 45:05.327
So you had to shit all over
the water wings story.

45:05.400 --> 45:06.765
You said it was a one-time thing.

45:06.840 --> 45:08.330
It was.

45:08.400 --> 45:09.686
- Really?
- Yeah.

45:09.760 --> 45:12.570
So you're actually gonna stand here
and look me in the eye and...

45:14.480 --> 45:16.881
- Wow, you're really good at lying.
- What?

45:16.960 --> 45:18.803
Hugh, forget it.
He knows.

45:18.880 --> 45:20.211
He's been spying on us.

45:20.320 --> 45:21.481
At the zoo?

45:21.560 --> 45:22.686
The zoo?

45:22.760 --> 45:26.810
So, wait a second, you guys are
actually having a full-on affair?

45:28.480 --> 45:30.164
I don't know what to call it.

45:30.240 --> 45:32.607
Well, what did you call it
when you busted him

45:32.680 --> 45:34.489
with a six-foot Swede named Elka?

45:34.560 --> 45:35.561
How is that relevant?

45:35.640 --> 45:38.041
"How is that relevant?"
Have you forgotten the last 20 years?

45:38.120 --> 45:39.281
You hate each other.

45:39.360 --> 45:42.569
Carter, I know you think you know better.
That's a trait you get from your father.

45:42.640 --> 45:43.801
I do know better.

45:43.880 --> 45:46.690
But the heart wants
what the heart wants.

45:47.160 --> 45:48.161
Come on.

45:48.240 --> 45:50.846
We are very confused, so we're
going to Wildwood this weekend,

45:50.920 --> 45:52.081
and we're gonna
figure it all out.

45:52.160 --> 45:54.242
There's a bluegrass festival,
and we're going to...

45:54.320 --> 45:56.448
No, Crystal Lake,
and it's jazz.

45:56.520 --> 45:57.521
What happened to Wildwood?

45:57.600 --> 45:59.409
I couldn't get the rate
on the room, so...

45:59.480 --> 46:01.323
- And when were you gonna tell me?
- I'm telling you now.

46:01.400 --> 46:02.686
- No, you weren't gonna tell me.
- Yeah, I was...

46:02.760 --> 46:04.649
You were not.
I have to drag it out of you.

46:04.720 --> 46:05.721
Hey!

46:05.800 --> 46:07.450
It's like pulling teeth!

46:07.520 --> 46:10.729
You're not going anywhere,
either of you. You are staying here.

46:10.800 --> 46:13.724
Do you hear me?
You stop it, now, both of you.

46:15.120 --> 46:16.531
Invitations just went out
for Trey's wedding,

46:16.600 --> 46:20.002
based on the assumption that you are
both married to other people.

46:20.640 --> 46:24.565
How in the world is he supposed
to have any faith whatsoever

46:24.640 --> 46:26.961
in the whole stupid
idea of marriage,

46:27.040 --> 46:29.361
if you two just keep
making a joke out of it?

46:29.440 --> 46:30.646
Stop it right there.

46:30.720 --> 46:32.961
You've never been married,
and you've never been divorced,

46:33.040 --> 46:35.281
so you do not know
what commitment is.

46:35.360 --> 46:36.361
You don't know.

46:36.480 --> 46:39.051
The most in love I've ever seen you
is with that mangy little dog you had.

46:39.120 --> 46:40.690
- Don't, don't...
- You keep Blackie out of this.

46:40.760 --> 46:42.330
No, I was right there,
Carter.

46:42.400 --> 46:44.004
- All right, all right.
- You weren't there.

46:44.080 --> 46:46.731
Are you gonna let him talk
to me this way?

46:46.800 --> 46:48.131
- (BOTH ARGUING)
- Shh. Quiet. Be quiet.

46:48.240 --> 46:50.925
We're in a Japanese restaurant.
Stop it, please.

46:53.240 --> 46:57.006
Now you get your ass back inside
and you apologize to the Takahashis.

46:58.560 --> 46:59.686
I'm...

46:59.760 --> 47:02.240
Come on. Come on.

47:02.840 --> 47:04.444
It's Kobayashis.

47:07.400 --> 47:09.050
You can just never
stop parenting.

47:09.120 --> 47:10.326
I know.

47:10.400 --> 47:12.767
Yeah, can't let it go.

47:12.840 --> 47:14.080
You were great.

47:17.400 --> 47:18.925
- Do we have to go back?
- No, no, come on.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.331
Okay, good.

47:27.040 --> 47:28.166
Carter.

47:28.280 --> 47:30.089
What a nice surprise.

47:33.880 --> 47:35.325
What's up, "C"?

47:35.720 --> 47:38.564
Gary, where does Mom keep all that
stuff that she never throws out,

47:38.640 --> 47:42.406
the pictures and the letters and
all the lawsuits and legal stuff?

47:42.480 --> 47:45.086
In the garage.
Hope you have a few days.

47:45.160 --> 47:46.525
Awesome.

47:47.760 --> 47:48.841
What the...

48:18.760 --> 48:22.685
Hey, I don't know if you heard the
news, but Trey is getting married.

48:22.760 --> 48:25.843
And, well, Elka,

48:25.920 --> 48:30.164
I had this really cool, really fun idea
that I thought you would love.

48:33.080 --> 48:36.084
I'm gonna call you back.

48:37.480 --> 48:38.720
Elka?

48:38.800 --> 48:41.041
- Yes.
- I didn't know you still talked.

48:41.120 --> 48:43.851
We don't.
I just had this idea that

48:43.920 --> 48:47.481
maybe if my dad were to bump
into Elka even for a second,

48:47.560 --> 48:50.404
he would get that look in his eye,
the panther,

48:50.480 --> 48:52.164
and my mom would be
an afterthought.

48:52.680 --> 48:55.365
Wow, panther.

48:56.720 --> 48:58.927
Um, I really think you need
to take a step back.

48:59.040 --> 49:00.041
What do you mean?

49:00.120 --> 49:02.805
They're adults.
Let them handle it.

49:02.880 --> 49:05.281
Oh, no, no, no, see?
I'm the adult. Okay?

49:05.360 --> 49:08.170
And, once again, I need to
remind them that they do not,

49:08.240 --> 49:10.322
under any circumstances,
belong together.

49:10.400 --> 49:14.564
Them together is
bad for everyone.

49:14.680 --> 49:16.045
Especially me.

49:16.840 --> 49:20.731
Makes sense. I mean, how could
Rick turn out any other way?

49:21.160 --> 49:22.127
What?

49:22.200 --> 49:25.807
It was in the book,
the one that you lied about.

49:25.880 --> 49:28.451
Dr. Judith came by.
She had some questions for me.

49:28.520 --> 49:30.727
She had a lot of questions.

49:30.800 --> 49:32.290
You gotta be kidding me.

49:32.360 --> 49:36.524
How come you can't tell me
about this, about any of it?

49:38.560 --> 49:42.167
Because I just...

49:43.360 --> 49:45.203
I can't believe she would
go behind my back.

49:45.280 --> 49:48.170
I mean, do you know that
she's not an actual doctor?

49:48.240 --> 49:49.765
- That she just does research?
- Right.

49:49.880 --> 49:50.961
Like, as a job?

49:51.040 --> 49:55.284
She just digs and digs
and digs and...

50:00.640 --> 50:02.722
I know it's a weird way
to wear a hat,

50:02.800 --> 50:04.928
but it just feels comfortable.

50:05.000 --> 50:06.843
She told me she wants me
to wear a wedding ring,

50:06.920 --> 50:10.083
but I said the only ring
I wear goes in my eyebrow.

50:10.160 --> 50:12.640
What does this have
to do with anything?

50:12.760 --> 50:14.171
(DOOR OPENS)

50:16.280 --> 50:19.443
Carter. I don't have
you on my schedule.

50:19.520 --> 50:22.649
Yeah, well, I figured, once you started
snooping around behind my back,

50:22.720 --> 50:24.370
all formalities were off.

50:24.440 --> 50:26.090
I can see you're very upset.

50:26.160 --> 50:27.605
What, are you a therapist now?

50:27.680 --> 50:30.251
Oh, and by the way,
don't let the new couch fool you

50:30.320 --> 50:31.845
or the new chair. What is it?

50:31.920 --> 50:33.285
It's a knockoff of
an Eames chair.

50:33.360 --> 50:35.522
That's not the point.
That's not why I was saying that.

50:35.600 --> 50:38.729
Oh, my God.
You're Rick.

50:40.560 --> 50:43.609
Mark a.k.a. Louis.

50:44.280 --> 50:47.602
Louis with the au pair
and the stutter.

50:47.680 --> 50:51.162
Stutter's gone.
I did marry the au pair.

50:52.120 --> 50:57.490
Can I just say, the birthday story,
such a heartbreaker.

50:58.040 --> 51:02.762
I mean, a seminal moment in my life,
and it's not even my life.

51:02.840 --> 51:04.080
Okay, Mark.

51:04.160 --> 51:05.491
Oh, all right.

51:05.560 --> 51:08.609
Could you just give
us a moment, okay?

51:08.680 --> 51:11.160
You, outside. Stay.

51:11.240 --> 51:12.241
Copy that.

51:15.240 --> 51:17.208
Is this about Lauren?

51:17.320 --> 51:21.041
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay. Well, sorry.

51:21.120 --> 51:22.770
I was just trying to
get a full picture.

51:22.840 --> 51:24.683
- No, it's fine.
- Really?

51:24.760 --> 51:26.364
Thing is you're barking
up the wrong tree.

51:26.440 --> 51:29.125
If I were you,
I would go to the source.

51:29.840 --> 51:31.001
I would talk to my parents.

51:31.080 --> 51:32.445
- Really?
- Yes.

51:32.520 --> 51:34.363
Pound them with questions,
really dig.

51:35.160 --> 51:36.321
See this box?

51:36.400 --> 51:38.050
This will help you.

51:38.120 --> 51:40.487
It's pictures, letters,
legal documents.

51:40.560 --> 51:42.801
You should show it to them
and ask them all about it.

51:42.880 --> 51:44.962
Okay, thank you,
and I will do that.

51:45.080 --> 51:46.320
Okay?

51:46.400 --> 51:48.767
Before the weekend.

51:48.840 --> 51:50.126
Got it.

51:51.680 --> 51:53.967
Hey, Lauren's really nice.

51:54.040 --> 51:56.441
You've been keeping a lot of
secrets from her, though, huh?

51:56.520 --> 51:58.443
Who does that remind you of?

51:58.520 --> 52:00.966
You are incredibly unprofessional.

52:04.320 --> 52:05.685
Get on it.

52:21.680 --> 52:22.681
- Trivia night.
- Trivia night?

52:22.760 --> 52:23.807
- Trivia night.
- What's that?

52:23.880 --> 52:25.291
Hey.

52:26.760 --> 52:28.171
Hey.
Hey.

52:28.640 --> 52:30.005
Do you work here?

52:30.080 --> 52:31.605
Kind of. It's my place.

52:33.560 --> 52:35.403
I'm sorry. I'm Carter.

52:36.080 --> 52:38.526
- Charles.
- Charles.

52:38.600 --> 52:41.080
So how do you two know each other?

52:42.800 --> 52:44.962
Well, we're part of a...

52:45.040 --> 52:46.007
- Book club.
- Book club.

52:46.080 --> 52:48.845
We're in a book club together.

52:48.920 --> 52:54.051
That's right. We're just finishing
<i>The Importance of Being Earnest.</i>

52:54.120 --> 52:55.121
That's a play.

52:55.640 --> 52:57.244
It's a progressive book club.

52:58.480 --> 52:59.811
(LAUGHING)

53:00.440 --> 53:02.966
All right, well, check's paid.
You want to go?

53:04.280 --> 53:05.964
Um,

53:06.040 --> 53:09.647
actually, you know what?
I think I'm gonna stay here

53:09.720 --> 53:12.644
and chat with Carter because

53:13.880 --> 53:18.283
there's a few things about
the play that I didn't quite get.

53:18.600 --> 53:19.601
Hmm.

53:19.680 --> 53:21.569
That's a farce.

53:21.640 --> 53:24.564
They farced the moral disintegration
of Victorian England.

53:25.800 --> 53:27.484
I didn't actually read it.

53:27.600 --> 53:29.364
I'll call you later.

53:29.440 --> 53:30.805
All right.

53:31.720 --> 53:33.609
- Nice meeting you.
- You, too.

53:33.680 --> 53:35.444
- Thanks.
- Oh, you're welcome.

53:35.520 --> 53:36.681
Sorry.

53:40.800 --> 53:42.290
That was my ex-husband.

53:42.720 --> 53:45.769
That was your ex-husband.
Ol' Man River?

53:46.160 --> 53:48.162
I actually think
he's quite sexy.

53:48.320 --> 53:51.164
(STAMMERING)
I do, too. I was just...

53:51.680 --> 53:58.529
So if you own the place,
then the wine's free?

53:59.840 --> 54:00.841
Yeah.

54:01.840 --> 54:05.447
CARTER: That lake house
was everything when I was a kid.

54:05.520 --> 54:09.047
The drive up there,
the smell of the lake.

54:09.160 --> 54:14.803
We had this bell,
this rusty, super loud bell.

54:14.880 --> 54:16.291
It was from a ship
or something.

54:16.360 --> 54:19.648
We could only ring it
when we first arrived.

54:20.240 --> 54:21.241
Um...

54:21.920 --> 54:25.527
It was just kind of awesome.
I don't know.

54:28.280 --> 54:31.489
Never been back.
Not since my ninth birthday.

54:34.680 --> 54:40.403
My parents sort of sucked
the joy right out of it, you know?

54:40.480 --> 54:42.721
- Fuck them.
- Yeah.

54:45.200 --> 54:48.807
How old were you
when you got married?

54:48.880 --> 54:50.211
Nineteen.

54:51.760 --> 54:53.808
It only lasted three years.

54:55.040 --> 54:57.486
But I got engaged twice after that.

54:58.080 --> 55:01.721
Wait a second. I just figured out
who you are in the book.

55:02.760 --> 55:03.807
You're Claire.

55:04.840 --> 55:07.241
Had her first boyfriend
when she was nine.

55:07.320 --> 55:10.688
You are Claire. Right?

55:10.760 --> 55:15.721
I have two dogs that need to
go out, so I'm gonna go.

55:16.560 --> 55:19.040
Okay. Yeah. Sure.

55:19.120 --> 55:20.690
All right.

55:20.760 --> 55:22.000
Thanks. This was...

55:22.080 --> 55:26.768
Oh, no, thank you.
it was nice talking to you.

55:26.840 --> 55:28.968
- Yeah. You, too.
- All right.

55:29.080 --> 55:30.081
- Cool.
- Yep.

55:31.680 --> 55:32.806
- Ow!
- Careful, careful.

55:33.760 --> 55:35.569
(DISHES CLATTERING)

55:51.560 --> 55:52.721
Hey, Etta.

55:53.440 --> 55:55.442
I forgot my purse.

56:06.400 --> 56:08.846
Maybe this isn't such
a good idea.

56:15.080 --> 56:16.047
Those look so good.

56:16.120 --> 56:17.565
Oh, no, no, don't.

56:17.640 --> 56:18.880
Don't you dare.

56:18.960 --> 56:20.246
All right.
I'll have it.

56:20.960 --> 56:23.008
Oh. Okay. Okay.

56:23.640 --> 56:26.962
Three, one, four, and two.

56:27.040 --> 56:30.169
I totally agree.
I'm so excited!

56:34.400 --> 56:36.323
Hey, what do you think?

56:37.160 --> 56:38.207
What?

56:38.280 --> 56:40.089
About the cake.
What's your pick?

56:40.160 --> 56:43.369
Oh, God, it's such
a tough choice. Um...

56:45.320 --> 56:48.688
They all taste the same,
and no one will like them.

56:48.800 --> 56:52.088
I don't get you, man.

56:53.680 --> 56:56.968
Look, if you're against this wedding,
you just need to come out and say that.

56:57.040 --> 56:58.087
I'm not.

56:58.160 --> 56:59.844
Well, then what is it?

57:00.440 --> 57:03.569
Things are just kind of out
of control right now, okay?

57:05.440 --> 57:06.646
I don't know
what that means.

57:06.720 --> 57:08.802
Well, it means
that you don't want to know, okay?

57:08.880 --> 57:10.291
So don't worry about it.

57:10.360 --> 57:12.488
You can tell me.
I'm a grown man, Carter.

57:14.520 --> 57:17.126
- Mom and Dad are together.
- What?

57:17.200 --> 57:19.202
That's right. I may have accidentally
gotten them back together.

57:19.280 --> 57:20.281
So there you go.

57:20.360 --> 57:22.362
- Together, together?
- Yeah.

57:26.480 --> 57:28.562
- Shit.
- Yeah.

57:29.480 --> 57:31.164
What do we do about this?
What should we do?

57:31.240 --> 57:32.605
I don't know.
I'm out of ideas.

57:32.680 --> 57:34.808
So why don't you
take the reins, okay?

57:35.600 --> 57:37.489
I got my own problems.

and not having a proper lease filed.

58:03.280 --> 58:05.408

That's just sad.

58:05.480 --> 58:08.324
Okay, Sondra,

58:08.400 --> 58:11.404
I know that you're upset,
and I actually don't blame you,

58:11.480 --> 58:13.801
but I don't think we should
do anything rash here.

58:13.880 --> 58:17.123
(STAMMERING) I mean,
both of you, you're just...

58:17.200 --> 58:18.929
You're so terrific together.

58:19.000 --> 58:20.809
Are you fucking serious, Carter?

58:20.880 --> 58:23.167
You've hated me from day one.
You call me the Cuntessa.

58:23.240 --> 58:27.165
I don't think I called you that.
That's terrible. I hate that.

58:27.240 --> 58:29.686
Excuse me, will you be careful
with that? It's very valuable.

58:29.760 --> 58:31.364
Sondra, let me buy
you out, please.

58:31.440 --> 58:34.489
Okay? I can get money.
I can get a loan of some sort,

58:34.560 --> 58:37.131
and I can't kick all
these people to the street.

58:37.240 --> 58:39.208
- Okay.
- Okay? Really?

58:39.280 --> 58:40.327
Yes.

58:42.600 --> 58:44.489
- Great.
- $100 million.

58:45.840 --> 58:46.841
Fine. $50.

58:46.960 --> 58:48.007
Okay, um...

58:48.080 --> 58:50.048
Do you know how many men
I could have married?

58:50.120 --> 58:52.282
A lot of men.

58:52.360 --> 58:53.361
And I married your father,

58:53.440 --> 58:55.886
who had an adult son
the same age as me.

58:55.960 --> 58:57.121
I'm a year younger than you.

58:57.200 --> 58:58.326
- You think?
- Yeah.

58:58.400 --> 58:59.401
Congratulations.

58:59.480 --> 59:00.481
It's irrelevant.

59:01.440 --> 59:04.842
You didn't spend five minutes
getting to know who I was.

59:04.920 --> 59:07.651
You just treated me
like some unwelcomed guest.

59:08.920 --> 59:09.967
Wow.

59:12.440 --> 59:15.649
Maybe in another time
we would have been friends.

59:16.800 --> 59:18.006
No.

59:18.640 --> 59:20.369
You have a week
to get out of here.

59:20.440 --> 59:22.044
You know what, Sondra?

59:22.160 --> 59:23.321
You...

59:37.160 --> 59:41.085
I'm dying here, man.
You got to move those accounts now.

59:41.160 --> 59:44.528
I don't know.
The Caymans? Delaware?

59:44.680 --> 59:47.126
Yeah, Delaware, I saw a thing
on the Internet about it.

59:47.200 --> 59:49.851
I'll call you back.
Numbnuts is here.

59:53.040 --> 59:55.327
You dumb son of a bitch.

59:55.400 --> 59:58.006
You dumb, dumb,
dumb son of a bitch.

59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.209
I mean, there's a reason we used you
as a go-between all these years.

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.125
Your brother sucks at it.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.009
- He told her?
- No, he e-mailed me to see

01:00:05.120 --> 01:00:09.523
if what you said was true to an
account that I share with Sondra.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.001
Okay, well, I wouldn't
have done that.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.160
You don't end a marriage
like this, son.

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.481
I could have made her miserable.

01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:22.722
I could have gotten
her to leave me.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.729
Do you have any idea
how much cheaper that is?

01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.884
Guess who's here.

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:33.007
We were hoping to hold all this off
until after Trey's big day.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:36.482
Darling, you know Daddy and I
did not want it to go this way.

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:39.040
You told me it was okay
to plan my wedding.

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:40.849
I thought it was.

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.524
Well, Kieko is pissed.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.364
She wants to postpone.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.965
The guest list is blown to shit.

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:47.371
Sandra's really pissed.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:50.125
Yeah, and I already sent Gary's
money to that DJ in Tel Aviv.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.531
You think those guys give refunds?

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.170
Listen, Carter, you knew about this
the whole time.

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.287
Why didn't you just tell me?

01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:58.044
Because I was trying
to protect you.

01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:59.645
Well, since when is
that your job?

01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.171
- Since when is it my job?
- Yeah.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:02.890
Since always.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.121
Trey, let me tell you something.

01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:07.727
The reason you're so clear-headed
about getting married

01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:12.567
is because I shielded you
from these two your whole life,

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:14.449
which, by the way,
almost didn't happen.

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.525
That's right. You were a last-ditch
effort to save this marriage.

01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.731
I mean, you're not even a person.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.245
You're a Hail Mary.

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.765
That's a stupid lie.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:25.171
Darling, you were an accident.

01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.681
Carter, you couldn't have timed this
any worse.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.569
Yeah, I agree.
I think he's jealous.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.641
Jealous?

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.525
Kieko thinks you're jealous.

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.011

going with Lauren?

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.605
Oh, since the beginning of time.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.682
- Exactly. We're in the game.
- And he's on the sidelines.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.250
- Yeah.
- No, wait a second.

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.004
- I'm in the game.
- Carter, you have to stop

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.809
pissing on our love parade.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:47.650
I can't... I don't even...

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.327

you out of my garage.

honestly appreciated them.

looked forward to the food,

share with you.

Go ahead.

01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:51.962

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:44.250
What are you doing here?

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:47.529
Your mother and I...

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:50.249
We actually used to use the place.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.480
You did?

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.211
Yeah. All the time.

01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:57.408
I repainted the canoe.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.287
Oh.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:06.249
I just thought I'd do some fishing.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.401
Clears my head.

Look, Gary, I'm really sorry.

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:17.442
Well, listen, my first two marriages
ended far worse.

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:21.482

I do, but I like it.

It's all over the front of my pants.
It fell down.

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:24.646
Who invited him?

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:26.131
I don't know.
He's just here.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.725

in the fridge, please.

TREY: Okay.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.128
Okay, what is going on?

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:34.249

some help with those?

- They what?
- No, no.

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.966
On the ride up here, you said
you barely remember the place.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:06.361
Yeah, I barely remember
the place with you.

You Google-mapped directions.

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.371
I should probably go.

SONDRA: I knew it.

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:15.404
The security company called
and said the alarm had been tripped.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.281
Is she speaking to us?

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:18.801
No.

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:20.450
I'm sorry. There's an alarm?

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:22.289
Yes, we added it a
couple months ago.

It was her idea.

01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:25.963
What other improvements
has she made to my house?

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:28.850
Well, Melissa, if you
actually need to know,

01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:33.164
we added a new septic system,
and I crocheted a few blankets.

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.327
You crochet?

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.448
Yes, asshole, I crochet.

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:40.531
I also finished
all the puzzles in the house.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.604
Wait a second. Am I the only one
that hasn't been coming here?

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:46.411
- We camped.
- But we never came in the house.

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:47.720
Yeah, he made me pee
under the porch.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:48.926
You're welcome.

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:52.370
Hugh and I had
some happy memories here.

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:53.930
And I had big plans for this place.

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:03.246
You'll never get this house.

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:04.765
You haven't met my lawyer.

01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.525
Well, Hugh and I are very good at
tying it up in court, aren't we, Hugh?

Oh, well, yeah.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.962
May I attempt to be a
voice of reason?

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.690
Shut up, Gary.

- Dick.
- MELISSA: Gary!

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:19.407
He is a dick. I had Carter out
of his restaurant in 12 hours.

01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:20.891

out of here in six.

didn't invite you.

- I wanted to.

01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:58.848

would not let me invite you.

- They're like fucking children.
- Yeah.

with them all these years.

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:12.210

your wedding.

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:14.009
No. You didn't.

you didn't like her,

that book that you're in,

01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:25.045

what you think.

- Kieko, call 611.

All right.

01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:37.884
Let's do this thing.

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:19.640
I am an ACOD.

01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:23.167
Yes, I am an adult child of divorce.

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:24.924
I am an ACOD.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.642
I am an ACOD. My parents
divorced when I was 10 years old.

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:32.803
My parents were divorced when I
was five, they were not in love.

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:37.124
Technically, I'm not an
adult child of divorce.

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:40.961
I was an adult
when my parents got divorced.

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:44.761
I am an ACOD.

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:49.846
I am an ACOD. I feel like
everyone probably is, on the set.

01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:52.088
I'm not an ACOD.

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:55.721
I am not an ACOD. My parents
have been married for 31 years.

01:23:55.840 --> 01:23:59.765
I am not an ACOD. My parents
are still happily married.

01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:01.410
They met when they
were in eighth grade.

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:06.771
I am not an ACOD. My parents
were married for 31 years,

01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:08.410
happily married the
whole time,

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:11.171
but my dad was married
four times before my mom.

01:24:11.240 --> 01:24:14.483
Yeah, I'm an adult child
of divorce, yes.

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:17.404
Uh, my parents got divorced
when I was 18 years old.

01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:20.609
Uh, my parents separated
when I was 12 months old.

01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:23.570
And, uh, got divorced
when I was five.

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:25.563
I don't ever remember
my parents being together.

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:27.529
They were divorced
by the time I was five.

01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:29.602
Four, five, six,
something like that.

01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:34.607
I have a half-brother
who's 13 years older than I am.

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:37.524
And I have a step-mom
and a step-dad.

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:41.525
My mom got remarried,
and divorced again,

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:45.241
and my dad is still a bachelor.
It's really awesome.

01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:49.484
My parents got divorced
when I was, gosh, five or six.

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:52.564
Uh, I've never known what it's
like for them to be together.

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:55.405
And, uh, it's pretty much
exactly like this movie,

01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:58.006
they've never been able to talk
and I've always been the middleman.

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.004
Parents divorced
when I was 11.

01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:05.051
Uh, remarried when I
was 17 and 18.

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:06.161
You know?

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:07.651
They've been divorced
for 15 years,

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.041
and they act like they never
even knew each other.

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:13.283
They act like they can't be
in the same room with one another.

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:14.600
I don't get it.

01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:19.891
It was horrible, the divorce, and
I ended up living with my mother,

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:22.167
and being the one
that was in charge of everyone.

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:25.847
I wanted to live with my dad,
but I fought and fought and fought,

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:28.810
and I couldn't do it,
so I just stayed here with my mom,

01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:32.089
and I still haven't seen
my dad in 25 years.

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:35.767
My mom remarried
when I was about four or five,

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:38.844
and my dad remarried
about the same time.

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:41.924
And they hated each other
the whole time.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.721
That was my mother's second husband,
my father's first wife.

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.804
My mother was then remarried
again for 13 years.

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:52.805
Uh, lam still the only child
as far as that's concerned.

01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:55.406
My father got remarried 20 years
ago and I have a step-sister,

01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:57.482
who I don't really
have a relationship with.

01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:59.688
My parents never got remarried.
My dad was gay.

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:03.247
Well, my father asked
my mother for a divorce.

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:06.284
But she died before
she could get one.

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:09.330
My dad is on,
well, technically, number five.

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:13.210
And, uh, mom never remarried.

01:26:13.280 --> 01:26:16.523
And, uh, I'm hoping to
break the curse.

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.489
My parents were divorced
when I was 10 years old,

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:22.531
but I still believe in marriage, and,
one day, I will find the right one.

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:24.011
I don't ever want to get married.

01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:26.287
I'm an ACOD,
I'm never getting married, either.

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:27.964
Now, I don't think I would
want to get married,

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:30.281
just because in my experience,
the marriage didn't work out.

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:32.165
I'm not getting married.

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:33.890
- CAMERAMAN: Ever?
- Never.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.480
I have been married twice
and divorced twice.

01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:37.686
I have been married.

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.125
- CAMERAMAN: How many times?
- Twice.

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:42.044
I don't like marriage,
never did, never will.

01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:44.521
I've been going with a guy
for 40 years, but I told him,

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:46.329
"Don't ever mention marriage."

01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:48.408
I think marriage is sacred.

01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:51.404
I think it's something
not to be taken lightly,

01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:54.051
and I think it can be
something amazing.

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:57.920
I feel good about marriage myself,
because I'm getting married in two days.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.287
I am not married.
I have better sense than that, sir.

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:03.643
Marriage?
I am married, but, uh...

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:08.171
I don't know.
I'm not too romantic about it.

01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:09.844
I want to get married,
but I am divorced.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.331
(LAUGHS)

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:15.127
I don't want to get married someday.
No, not really.

01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:16.406
CAMERAMAN:
No? Why?

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:19.609
Why? Because I've never
seen one that's worked.

01:27:19.680 --> 01:27:21.682
Never seen any
marriages that work.
