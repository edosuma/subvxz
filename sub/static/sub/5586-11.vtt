DEWEY:
For the love of God!

01:00.930 --> 01:02.149
We should have left for

01:02.236 --> 01:03.715
the airport nine minutes ago!

01:03.802 --> 01:06.066
Dewey's in this big-deal
piano competition

01:06.153 --> 01:07.458
in St. Louis this weekend.

01:07.545 --> 01:09.199
It's being held at a huge,
fancy hotel.

01:09.286 --> 01:10.766
Prominent musicians
from all around the world

01:10.853 --> 01:12.463
are going to be there.

01:12.550 --> 01:14.857
And the best part is, Reese
and I don't have to go.

01:14.944 --> 01:16.728
This is unbelievable!

01:16.815 --> 01:18.991
She's leaving us alone in the
house for the whole weekend!

01:19.079 --> 01:20.210
She's losing it!

01:20.297 --> 01:21.429
Shh. Don't remind her.

01:21.516 --> 01:22.734
Be cool.

01:22.821 --> 01:24.780
...Four, and Dewey's
makes five...

01:24.867 --> 01:27.522
I still feel
like I'm forgetting something.

01:28.610 --> 01:30.394
Okay, listen,
they're not likely to do

01:30.481 --> 01:33.441
another Patrick Swayze festival
for four, maybe five years,

01:33.528 --> 01:35.704
so I'm counting on you
to tape the whole thing.

01:35.791 --> 01:37.662
LOIS:
Let's go!

01:37.749 --> 01:40.839
We still have to drop Jamie
off at Mrs. Foley's.

01:40.926 --> 01:43.015
I still feel like I'm
forgetting something.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.714
[doorbell rings]

01:45.801 --> 01:47.890
Hi, Mom. I thought
we were gonna miss you.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.545
Be careful with those bags,
you cow.

01:50.632 --> 01:51.676
Hi, Raduca.

01:51.763 --> 01:53.156
Family, howdy.

01:53.243 --> 01:56.855
You're here to work, not
gossip like a fishwife.

01:56.942 --> 01:58.988
What's Grandma
doing here?!

01:59.075 --> 02:00.555
You never said
Grandma was coming!

02:00.642 --> 02:02.339
Oh, I didn't?

02:02.426 --> 02:04.994
Ah, well, then, it's just
a nice surprise for you boys.

02:05.081 --> 02:07.823
Remember last month when you
came in after curfew

02:07.910 --> 02:10.347
and you said, "What are you
going to do about it?"

02:10.434 --> 02:13.785
Sorry it took me so long
to get back to you.

02:21.924 --> 02:24.622
These are sex organs of
four different animals.

02:25.623 --> 02:28.017
And a little oregano.

02:29.410 --> 02:32.195
Reese, I've watched you grow
all these years.

02:32.282 --> 02:35.024
You are the one hope
for this family.

02:35.111 --> 02:39.463
I just pray you are ready
to become a man.

02:39.550 --> 02:40.812
Ow!

02:40.899 --> 02:41.900
Hey, what was that for?

02:43.859 --> 02:46.427
You are ready.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.953
LOIS:
Dewey, slow down.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.302
No, we have to get
to Gate Seven

02:52.389 --> 02:53.173
or we'll miss
our connecting flight.

02:53.260 --> 02:55.044
Oooh. Cinnabons!

02:55.131 --> 02:57.699
No! No Cinnabons, no
pretzels, no frozen yogurt.

02:57.786 --> 03:00.484
You can raid the mini-bar
when we get to the hotel.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.834
Do I have your permission
to go to the bathroom?

03:02.921 --> 03:05.097
No. If you go to the other
side of the partition,

03:05.185 --> 03:07.012
then we'll all have to go
through security again.

03:07.099 --> 03:09.798
Dad, you tell her.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.191
Dad?

03:14.455 --> 03:17.806
Ooh, it's Paris.

03:17.893 --> 03:20.722
It's even more beautiful
than I imagined!

03:22.245 --> 03:24.160
IDA:
In our country,

03:24.247 --> 03:28.599
after a boy turns 16,
he becomes a barochi.

03:28.686 --> 03:32.777
We watch this boy for one year.
Then, when he is ready,

03:32.864 --> 03:34.866
he is plucked from
his mother's teat

03:34.953 --> 03:36.955
and thrown into
the town square,

03:37.042 --> 03:40.916
where he must battle with the
other boys for dominance.

03:41.003 --> 03:42.134
Wait, up until
this point,

03:42.222 --> 03:43.353
they're still
breast feeding?

03:43.440 --> 03:45.921
It keeps families close.

03:46.008 --> 03:48.837
The boys fight each other
with all their might.

03:48.924 --> 03:53.276
When it is over, the one
left standing is the man.

03:53.363 --> 03:56.236
The rest are dronska.

03:56.323 --> 03:59.587
Then more breasts are offered
to the proud young man.

03:59.674 --> 04:03.852
But these are not the withered
spigots of the mother, no.

04:03.939 --> 04:05.593
These are the ripe,

04:05.680 --> 04:10.511
inviting pleasure domes
of the virgins of the village,

04:10.598 --> 04:14.732
presented dripping with wine.

04:14.819 --> 04:17.735
Our family comes from the
coolest country in the world.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.781
And it must continue, Reese.

04:19.868 --> 04:22.827
You must carry on
with this ritual.

04:22.914 --> 04:25.047
Grandma, this is not only
moronic, it's impossible.

04:25.134 --> 04:26.527
For one thing, there is no
village full of boys

04:26.614 --> 04:27.789
for Reese to fight.

04:27.876 --> 04:29.878
No, we will have to make do.

04:29.965 --> 04:32.228
The closest thing we have
to a boy is you.

04:32.315 --> 04:33.969
What?

04:34.056 --> 04:36.058
You shall be the rock on which
his knife is sharpened.

04:36.145 --> 04:38.930
There will be contests
of strength and endurance.

04:39.017 --> 04:41.629
When he defeats you,
he shall be a man.

04:41.716 --> 04:42.934
What if I defeat him?

04:43.021 --> 04:44.762
[both laughing]

04:45.981 --> 04:49.854
And once you are a man,
you shall get this.

04:49.941 --> 04:52.596
The whole plate
of potatoes?

04:52.683 --> 04:56.426
You will take Raduca
for your bride.

04:56.513 --> 04:59.342
You mean, like,
I marry her? Now?

04:59.429 --> 05:02.084
That is why I brought Raduca
to this country.

05:02.171 --> 05:03.346
You brought her here
six months ago.

05:03.433 --> 05:04.869
She's been working
as your slave.

05:04.956 --> 05:06.567
I should get something
for my trouble.

05:06.654 --> 05:08.569
Grandma, you can't take
two teenagers

05:08.656 --> 05:10.005
who've never met each other

05:10.092 --> 05:11.746
and force them into
some sham marriage.

05:11.833 --> 05:14.096
That's not the way things
work in civilized countries.

05:14.183 --> 05:15.880
If I get a wife, does
that mean I get to have sex?

05:15.967 --> 05:18.318
So much sex
you won't believe it.

05:20.407 --> 05:22.147
I'm in.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.201
Well, Dad,

05:32.288 --> 05:33.768
this makes it all worth it.

05:33.855 --> 05:35.509
They never
have "Deweys."

05:35.596 --> 05:36.597
Look, there's no one there.

05:40.601 --> 05:43.430
Ma'am, we need you
to get back in line.

05:43.517 --> 05:45.562
We're just trying to
get in the empty one.

05:45.649 --> 05:47.434
That line
is for first class

05:47.521 --> 05:49.218
and Commodores' Club
passengers only.

05:49.305 --> 05:51.351
Excuse me?

05:51.438 --> 05:53.744
Mom, we need
to make this flight.

05:53.831 --> 05:56.051
So, this airport's policy is
that increased security

05:56.138 --> 05:58.270
should only inconvenience
poor people?

05:58.358 --> 05:59.489
I don't make
the rules, ma'am.

05:59.576 --> 06:01.099
No, no one makes the rules.

06:01.186 --> 06:02.753
Why would anyone want
to take responsibility...?

06:02.840 --> 06:05.713
Mom!

06:07.976 --> 06:09.543
[beeping]

06:09.630 --> 06:11.371
Ma'am, step
over here, please.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.285
Oh, I know
what it is.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.722
It's the underwire
in my bra.

06:14.809 --> 06:16.854
It always sets
these things off.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.421
[beeping]

06:18.508 --> 06:21.772
You seem to have something
under your shirt.

06:21.859 --> 06:25.820
Yes, as I said, I have a bra on
under my shirt,

06:25.907 --> 06:28.692
and there is an underwire
in my bra.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.696
-Code 25.
-AGENT: Affirmative.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.263
I can't believe this
is the first underwire

06:34.350 --> 06:35.743
to come through this place.

06:35.830 --> 06:36.918
Surely you people have

06:37.005 --> 06:38.398
encountered bras before.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.051
This is punishment
for what I said

06:40.138 --> 06:41.705
about the first-class
line, isn't it?

06:41.792 --> 06:43.881
Ma'am, I need to touch
your breasts.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.840
You need to touch my what?!

06:45.927 --> 06:48.103
I'm required to probe
with the back of my hand.

06:48.190 --> 06:50.714
If you like, you can request
up to two female witnesses.

06:50.801 --> 06:52.194
Let me
understand this.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.109
Because I made a comment
about first class,

06:54.196 --> 06:56.067
I am being singled out
for a public feel-up?

06:56.154 --> 06:57.982
Oh for God's sake,
Mom,

06:58.069 --> 07:00.550
just let her touch
your boobs!

07:00.637 --> 07:02.378
The kid makes a lot
of sense, ma'am.

07:02.465 --> 07:04.946
Now, do you want
to do this the easy way

07:05.033 --> 07:06.643
or the hard way?

07:09.211 --> 07:12.432
Okay, the tickets
are changed.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.956
The next flight leaves
in 15 hours.

07:15.043 --> 07:16.914
So I get no time to practice
and no sleep tonight.

07:17.001 --> 07:18.525
HAL: You should have seen
what happened

07:18.612 --> 07:19.917
the first time
I touched them.

07:33.844 --> 07:36.847
HAL:
Oh...

07:39.894 --> 07:41.765
BUSINESSMAN:
No, I'm canceling everything.

07:41.852 --> 07:44.202
I'm chartering a helicopter
and getting out of...

07:44.289 --> 07:46.335
Sorry. Oh, I...

07:46.422 --> 07:48.729
No, I just tripped over
some stupid kid

07:48.816 --> 07:50.731
that was playing around
on the floor.

07:50.818 --> 07:53.211
I'm sorry...
I-I'm so sorry.

08:06.616 --> 08:08.313
Two boys enter,

08:08.400 --> 08:10.794
one man emerges.

08:10.881 --> 08:14.885
You must beat him
at every contest

08:14.972 --> 08:18.149
or there will be no bride
for you.

08:18.236 --> 08:21.805
I really appreciate
you doing this for me.

08:21.892 --> 08:24.808
Listen, moron, I'm not doing
this to help you get married.

08:24.895 --> 08:26.244
I'm gonna
try to win to keep you

08:26.331 --> 08:28.333
from flushing
your life down the toilet.

08:28.420 --> 08:31.119
We begin with the Trial of Pain.

08:31.206 --> 08:33.904
Raduca, the strings.

08:42.217 --> 08:46.090
This trial teaches
an important lesson.

08:46.177 --> 08:48.528
Until you can ignore
your own pain,

08:48.615 --> 08:53.924
you cannot truly ignore
the pain of others.

08:54.011 --> 08:57.145
The first one
to take two steps backwards

08:57.232 --> 08:59.539
is the victor.

08:59.626 --> 09:02.237
I don't get why this
is supposed to hurt so much.

09:02.324 --> 09:04.456
Go.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.459
[both screaming]

09:10.201 --> 09:14.162
I didn't think anything above my
waist could be so sensitive.

09:14.249 --> 09:15.946
Why don't you want me
to be happy?!

09:16.033 --> 09:17.252
I'm only doing this
because I love you!

09:17.339 --> 09:18.601
[screaming continues]

09:18.688 --> 09:21.169
Must...
take... mind off...

09:21.256 --> 09:23.606
ear pain!

09:23.693 --> 09:25.739
-[screaming]
-Ow! Ow! Ow!

09:27.131 --> 09:28.959
The victor!

09:29.046 --> 09:30.482
That was so easy!

09:30.570 --> 09:33.224
I barely worked up a sweat.

09:42.451 --> 09:44.279
-Oh...
-May I help you?

09:44.366 --> 09:46.150
Oh, hi, yes.

09:46.237 --> 09:50.894
It kills me to have to do this,
but I'm gonna return this.

09:50.981 --> 09:54.419
No... please, Mr. Saunders,
don't do that.

09:54.506 --> 09:55.943
I implore you.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.901
We know our service got
a little slack last year,

09:57.988 --> 09:59.337
but we have improved.

09:59.424 --> 10:01.383
We have expanded
the buffet.

10:01.470 --> 10:02.776
Before you make
a decision,

10:02.863 --> 10:05.300
let us get you
a massage or a manicure.

10:05.387 --> 10:07.911
We have complimentary
30-year-old Scotch

10:07.998 --> 10:09.521
and a full bar.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.741
Can't we please,
please,

10:11.828 --> 10:14.875
persuade you to give us
another chance?

10:18.226 --> 10:20.271
Well, all right.

10:20.358 --> 10:25.015
But let's not have a repeat
of last time.

10:25.102 --> 10:29.237
You are now one step closer
to your manhood.

10:29.324 --> 10:34.024
The next trial takes place
within the Sack of Fellowship.

10:34.111 --> 10:36.940
Once inside the sack
you will face a choice:

10:37.027 --> 10:40.640
To work together
or to fight each other.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.163
If you work together,

10:42.250 --> 10:44.165
you'll both lose.

10:44.252 --> 10:45.296
So now what happens?

10:45.383 --> 10:47.124
I don't know.

10:47.211 --> 10:49.605
I'm still trying to figure out
why there's a dog in here.

10:50.998 --> 10:52.695
Grandma, what are we supposed
to do?

10:52.782 --> 10:53.783
Just get out.

10:53.870 --> 10:55.698
-That's it?
-That's it.

10:57.526 --> 11:00.529
[barking, snarling
and screaming]

11:08.189 --> 11:10.670
[screaming continues]

11:22.203 --> 11:24.422
I did it! Yeah!

11:24.509 --> 11:26.598
Okay, Reese, you beat me fair
and square.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.078
Just-Just help me get ou...

11:28.165 --> 11:29.906
Yeah!

11:29.993 --> 11:31.212
Yeah, yeah...

11:31.299 --> 11:33.301
Yeah, yeah!

11:33.388 --> 11:35.869
[all screaming]

11:37.566 --> 11:39.002
How's it going, sport?

11:39.089 --> 11:41.701
Fantastic. I've been practicing
for hours.

11:41.788 --> 11:44.399
Of course, I'm screwed if we
have to play on real pianos.

11:44.486 --> 11:45.617
Ah, buck up, son.

11:45.705 --> 11:46.662
We're all sacrificing.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.185
Why are your nails shiny?

11:48.272 --> 11:50.013
No reason.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.276
Can I at least have a dollar
for the soda machine?

11:52.363 --> 11:54.583
Nope. All gone
to the great tip fairy.

11:54.670 --> 11:57.368
Boy, these chairs are hard.

12:03.984 --> 12:05.246
Stop, thief!

12:05.333 --> 12:06.726
Ow! Ow!

12:06.813 --> 12:08.945
Dewey, I'm sorry!
Ow!

12:09.032 --> 12:10.338
You crushed my fingers.

12:10.425 --> 12:12.166
I didn't mean to.
Let me see.

12:12.253 --> 12:13.384
Look what you
did to me.

12:13.471 --> 12:14.385
Keep the fingers
elevated, Dewey,

12:14.472 --> 12:15.822
and don't worry.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.694
I know where I can
find some Evian ice.

12:18.781 --> 12:20.087
Cool!

12:20.174 --> 12:21.958
Grandma's got props
for the next one.

12:22.045 --> 12:23.394
I'm done, Reese.

12:23.481 --> 12:24.787
I'm not going through
any more of these trials.

12:24.874 --> 12:26.528
What's the matter?

12:26.615 --> 12:28.443
I thought we were finally
doing something as a family.

12:28.530 --> 12:31.620
If you want to let that crazy
old bat ruin your life, fine.

12:31.707 --> 12:32.926
Knock yourself out.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.231
How is she
ruining my life?

12:34.318 --> 12:37.365
She's getting me a bride.
A female bride.

12:37.452 --> 12:38.758
I mean, what are the odds

12:38.845 --> 12:40.237
that a girl is ever
going to want me?

12:40.324 --> 12:42.152
You can get a girl,
Reese.

12:42.239 --> 12:43.675
If you just didn't act
like a vicious,

12:43.763 --> 12:45.155
stupid thug all the time.

12:45.242 --> 12:47.854
Come on, Malcolm,
let's be realistic.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.725
Grandma, Malcolm doesn't want
to play anymore.

12:49.812 --> 12:51.074
So I guess I win
by forfeit.

12:51.161 --> 12:52.249
What?!

12:52.336 --> 12:55.078
You cannot become
a man by forfeit.

12:55.165 --> 12:57.428
You must go through
all the trials.

12:57.515 --> 12:59.561
You must win every one.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.476
But they're your rules.
Can't you just change them?

13:01.563 --> 13:03.043
These are not my rules.

13:03.130 --> 13:04.871
These are the ways
of our people.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.611
The ways cannot die.

13:06.698 --> 13:08.004
Yes, they can.

13:08.091 --> 13:09.963
They should.
They should be murdered

13:10.050 --> 13:11.921
and mashed up
and dumped

13:12.008 --> 13:14.184
down a salt mine along with
nuclear waste and left there

13:14.271 --> 13:18.101
to fester and rot in a toxic
pool of its own filth!

13:18.188 --> 13:21.235
Your pretty words
don't hide your fear.

13:21.322 --> 13:22.366
What?!

13:22.453 --> 13:24.412
You are afraid
of the next trial

13:24.499 --> 13:26.675
because it is a test
of intelligence.

13:26.762 --> 13:27.981
You are afraid to find out

13:28.068 --> 13:31.158
who is really the
smart one in the family.

13:31.245 --> 13:32.463
He goes around

13:32.550 --> 13:34.988
with his nose in a book,
sucking in facts.

13:35.075 --> 13:36.424
He doesn't have
what we have.

13:36.511 --> 13:39.427
You and I have
street smarts.

13:39.514 --> 13:41.124
Oh, here we go.

13:41.211 --> 13:44.127
Every moron who's willing
to act like a criminal

13:44.214 --> 13:45.737
is loaded with
street smarts.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.087
Well, let me tell you
something, Grandma,

13:47.174 --> 13:48.915
you're either smart
or you're not.

13:49.002 --> 13:50.742
Saying you have
street smarts

13:50.830 --> 13:52.353
just means you're willing
to do things

13:52.440 --> 13:54.659
that smart, sensitive people
are too decent to do.

13:54.746 --> 13:57.227
That's not a sign
of intelligence.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.623
It's not.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.192
It's not!

14:05.279 --> 14:08.630
I promise to always
love and respect you.

14:08.717 --> 14:11.067
As long as you stay
in a 20-pound weight range.

14:12.939 --> 14:15.158
Oh, ah...

14:16.899 --> 14:18.335
Your drink, sir.

14:18.422 --> 14:22.383
Arturo, I would be
a dead man without you.

14:22.470 --> 14:23.688
Mr. Saunders.

14:23.775 --> 14:26.387
Please. Mr. Saunders
is my father.

14:26.474 --> 14:27.692
You can call me...

14:28.737 --> 14:30.565
what my first name is.

14:30.652 --> 14:31.871
If you'll just follow me.

14:35.265 --> 14:37.267
Now, do I disrobe
for a salt glow,

14:37.354 --> 14:38.747
or just strip
to the waist?

14:38.834 --> 14:40.357
-Sit down here.
-Oh.

14:40.444 --> 14:41.663
Our teleconference service
was down for an hour.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.491
I'm sorry it took
so long to set up,

14:43.578 --> 14:45.797
but everyone's ready
for you now.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.017
London, Berlin,

14:48.104 --> 14:49.062
Tokyo.

14:49.149 --> 14:51.499
Tokyo?

14:51.586 --> 14:55.459
Mr. Saunders, we finally
meet face to face.

14:55.546 --> 14:58.288
Yes, uh...

14:58.375 --> 15:00.856
Well... hi, there.

15:00.943 --> 15:03.815
I'm afraid we can't wait
for your reply any longer.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.817
We need an answer from you.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.558
You need an answer from me?

15:07.645 --> 15:09.212
We have five governments
involved.

15:09.299 --> 15:11.214
If you can't decide,

15:11.301 --> 15:14.174
we shall have no choice
but to sever all ties.

15:14.261 --> 15:16.567
That means Malaysia,

15:16.654 --> 15:21.355
that means Taiwan, that means
the entire eastern sector!

15:21.442 --> 15:23.531
MAN: We need you
to choose now, sir.

15:23.618 --> 15:27.143
Is it yes... or no?

15:27.230 --> 15:30.190
Okay, um...

15:30.277 --> 15:32.148
Just...

16:13.189 --> 16:16.062
WOMAN: Fine. You have us
at a disadvantage.

16:16.149 --> 16:20.588
We will wire another
six million into your account.

16:20.675 --> 16:24.722
All right, then.

16:24.809 --> 16:26.768
The answer is yes.

16:26.855 --> 16:28.465
Very good.

16:28.552 --> 16:31.251
We'll begin shipping
the antidote at once.

16:31.338 --> 16:34.689
Oh... excellent.

16:34.776 --> 16:36.908
By the way,

16:36.996 --> 16:41.087
are-are we... good guys?

16:41.174 --> 16:44.481
[laughing]

16:51.184 --> 16:52.272
Hey, honey.

16:52.359 --> 16:53.621
What have you
been doing?

16:53.708 --> 16:56.493
Well, I can honestly say
I have no idea.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.147
Do you want me to...?

16:58.234 --> 16:59.540
No.

16:59.627 --> 17:01.716
-Stupid hot sauce.
-You okay?

17:01.803 --> 17:03.457
Dewey's been absolutely
horrible to me.

17:03.544 --> 17:06.025
I know we missed the flight,
I know I hurt his fingers,

17:06.112 --> 17:08.114
I know this isn't the greatest
day of his life,

17:08.201 --> 17:09.332
but he's been acting
like I'm trying

17:09.419 --> 17:11.117
to ruin his contest
on purpose.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.989
Well, honey, it has been
an awful lot of stuff in a row.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.425
What are you saying, Hal?

17:15.512 --> 17:16.731
You agree with him?

17:16.818 --> 17:18.559
You actually think
that I would...?

17:18.646 --> 17:20.473
[screaming]

17:23.303 --> 17:25.479
This is the final test.

17:25.566 --> 17:27.220
The game of Vishnok

17:27.307 --> 17:28.525
will show us who

17:28.612 --> 17:29.613
has the brains around here.

17:29.700 --> 17:30.788
Grandma, how do we play?

17:30.875 --> 17:32.442
Shh! You will listen!

17:34.444 --> 17:35.489
The rabbits

17:35.576 --> 17:38.231
run to their lair.

17:38.318 --> 17:42.670
The moon embraces you.

17:42.757 --> 17:47.588
The horse turns to lead.

17:47.675 --> 17:50.765
The apple holds

17:50.852 --> 17:52.767
the key.

17:55.987 --> 17:57.511
You have two minutes.

17:57.598 --> 17:59.687
What are we doing?

17:59.774 --> 18:01.428
I don't know.

18:02.429 --> 18:03.952
Did you feel this?

18:04.039 --> 18:05.997
What?
[grunts]

18:06.085 --> 18:07.651
The rabbits run to their lair.

18:07.738 --> 18:09.653
-[Reese shouts]
-The moon embraces you.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.307
The horse turns

18:11.394 --> 18:13.179
-to lead.
-[yells]

18:16.138 --> 18:19.010
[coughing]

18:19.098 --> 18:20.925
The apple holds the key.

18:21.012 --> 18:23.841
Ha! I beat him! It's over!

18:23.928 --> 18:25.191
...proski, verontut...

18:25.278 --> 18:26.583
The marriage is off.

18:26.670 --> 18:29.195
After 2,000 years
your ways are dead.

18:29.282 --> 18:33.547
I am content the ways
have been followed.

18:33.634 --> 18:35.157
What?!

18:35.244 --> 18:37.551
No. No, you don't get to pretend
you're okay with this.

18:37.638 --> 18:39.335
I never followed
your ways.

18:39.422 --> 18:41.859
Well, I did, but it was
for a different reason...

18:41.946 --> 18:43.252
Pack up my things, cow.

18:43.339 --> 18:44.471
We leave
in five minutes.

18:44.558 --> 18:45.820
REESE:
No, wait.

18:46.864 --> 18:48.475
Don't go!

18:48.562 --> 18:49.998
I got two out of three.

18:50.085 --> 18:52.000
There must be some way
I can marry Raduca.

18:52.087 --> 18:53.175
It is impossible.

18:53.262 --> 18:54.611
You're not a man.

18:54.698 --> 18:56.657
The most you can ever
hope to be now

18:56.744 --> 18:58.789
is a very butch woman.

18:58.876 --> 19:02.184
Well, I'm going
to marry her anyway!

19:02.271 --> 19:05.013
It is forbidden.
The ways don't allow you.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.581
Well, then from now on,
I reject your ways forever!

19:07.668 --> 19:09.670
[gasps]

19:09.757 --> 19:13.935
Listen, I'm not
the perfect guy.

19:14.022 --> 19:16.067
I might not even be
a good guy.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.244
But if you marry me,

19:18.331 --> 19:20.289
we'll both be certain
for the rest of our lives

19:20.376 --> 19:22.291
that I never could
have done any better.

19:22.378 --> 19:24.598
She will never marry
a dronska like you.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.469
She's a good girl.

19:26.556 --> 19:28.254
I will marry you.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.908
I forbid you
to do this!

19:30.995 --> 19:32.432
You cannot forbid me.

19:32.519 --> 19:35.043
I am American girl now.

19:35.130 --> 19:36.653
I have iPod.

19:36.740 --> 19:37.872
I wear thong.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.352
I shave!

19:39.439 --> 19:41.963
Hide your shame, whore!

19:42.050 --> 19:43.747
You can't talk
to my wife that way.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.446
I'm going to spend
the rest of my life

19:46.533 --> 19:49.579
with the woman
I probably love.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.113
Well, apparently only
permanent blindness

20:02.201 --> 20:04.377
gets you bumped up
to first class.

20:04.464 --> 20:06.248
The redness is going down.

20:06.335 --> 20:08.642
I think you can
compete just fine.

20:08.729 --> 20:10.209
Why don't you just
cut the act, Mom?

20:10.296 --> 20:11.732
You got what you wanted.

20:11.819 --> 20:13.429
What are you talking about?

20:13.516 --> 20:15.126
You don't like watching me
be successful, because it

20:15.214 --> 20:17.172
reminds you that you never
did anything with your life.

20:17.259 --> 20:20.523
And now, instead of taking joy
in your kids' accomplishments,

20:20.610 --> 20:22.743
you undermine us so we
won't show you up.

20:22.830 --> 20:23.961
Maybe it's unconscious,

20:24.048 --> 20:26.007
maybe you know
you're doing it,

20:26.094 --> 20:28.836
but that's what's been
going on this whole trip.

20:28.923 --> 20:30.838
-So what?
-Huh?

20:30.925 --> 20:32.579
You think you're the first kid
in the world

20:32.666 --> 20:33.797
whose parents ever
sabotaged him?

20:33.884 --> 20:35.364
Please, Dewey,

20:35.451 --> 20:36.409
parents undermine
their children all the time.

20:36.496 --> 20:37.671
My dad told me

20:37.758 --> 20:38.976
I would never amount
to anything

20:39.063 --> 20:40.282
and live a life
of hardship

20:40.369 --> 20:42.589
and constant disappointment.

20:42.676 --> 20:43.981
Oh.

20:44.068 --> 20:46.288
Wait. We're talking about Mom.

20:46.375 --> 20:47.594
Well, you shouldn't be.

20:47.681 --> 20:49.596
This is your life.

20:49.683 --> 20:50.988
Crap flies at you.

20:51.075 --> 20:52.773
You got to learn
to deal with it.

20:52.860 --> 20:55.471
Besides, which story would
you rather tell--

20:55.558 --> 20:57.473
the one where you
show up at a contest,

20:57.560 --> 21:00.128
play something
and get a prize,

21:00.215 --> 21:02.652
or the one where your
family torpedoes you

21:02.739 --> 21:04.480
and even though you are
crippled and blind,

21:04.567 --> 21:06.613
you still come through
to win first place?

21:06.700 --> 21:09.224
I guess the second
one's a better story.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.357
Of course it is.

21:11.444 --> 21:13.924
Okay, Mom.

21:14.011 --> 21:16.623
Let's go
to St. Louis.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.059
Damn straight.

21:18.146 --> 21:19.495
Let's win this thing.

21:21.367 --> 21:25.327
Wow, that Chinese
kid was good.

21:25.414 --> 21:27.068
I have to hand
it to you, Mom,

21:27.155 --> 21:28.765
having Grandma look after us
sure kept us out of trouble.

Where's your brother?

21:29.940 --> 21:31.115
In Vegas.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.945

man and wife.

["Battle Hymn
of the Republic" plays]

21:38.253 --> 21:41.212
I'll do everything I can
to make you happy.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.258
As soon as we get home,

21:43.345 --> 21:46.261
I'm kicking Dewey and Malcolm
out of the big bed.
