WEBVTT

00:02.143 --> 00:04.056
Previously on The X-Files...

00:04.123 --> 00:07.510
You sent for me. I'm here.

00:07.875 --> 00:09.141
You are witnessing what may be

00:09.177 --> 00:11.077
the advent of a global contagion.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.578
To kill everyone but the chosen.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.847
Alien DNA mixed with our DNA.

00:14.882 --> 00:17.016
Science given to them by an alien race.

00:17.051 --> 00:20.853
Neither you nor I could save
mankind from self-extermination.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.257
I just changed the timetable.

00:25.293 --> 00:28.294
Get to the hospital.
Help is on its way, I promise.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.499
That their fates
were sealed since birth.

00:33.534 --> 00:35.768
They were simply puppets.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.470
The world will go on.

00:39.273 --> 00:41.307
Just in my image instead of God's.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.313
Who sent you?

00:49.283 --> 00:52.118
You see a seemingly weak man.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.954
But I'm the most powerful man
in the world.

00:58.393 --> 01:00.893
My name is Carl Gerhard Busch.

01:00.928 --> 01:03.462
But I've been known by many aliases

01:03.498 --> 01:06.599
during my long career
with the U.S. government.

01:06.634 --> 01:08.901
It's been a humbling job,

01:08.936 --> 01:11.420
though I'm hardly known as a humble man.

01:11.527 --> 01:14.495
I've been a witness to history,
much of it violent,

01:14.530 --> 01:19.667
much of it an abomination of
the values Americans hold dear.

01:19.702 --> 01:22.570
I've had a privileged seat
at the centers of power,

01:22.605 --> 01:24.272
held the reins of that power,

01:24.307 --> 01:26.173
making sacrifices few are capable of,

01:26.209 --> 01:28.843
of which even fewer are willing.

01:28.878 --> 01:33.481
If people knew the truth,
they'd riot in the streets.

01:33.516 --> 01:35.783
Too much is made of the will to power,

01:35.818 --> 01:38.653
as if our will is free,
our choices our own.

01:38.688 --> 01:41.689
Our destinies are forged in our bones,

01:41.724 --> 01:45.126
made real by a raging impulse
to self-destruct.

01:48.731 --> 01:51.799
I'm not a bad man, more a practical man.

01:51.834 --> 01:55.136
I've taken certain gifts I was
given and made good men great.

01:55.171 --> 01:57.071
It is my greatness.

01:59.409 --> 02:02.310
I'm a father to two men who
have figured more in the future

02:02.345 --> 02:03.878
than they might ever know.

02:03.913 --> 02:06.447
Both would end up working for the FBI,

02:06.482 --> 02:10.518
both complex but dedicated men
who sacrificed dearly,

02:10.553 --> 02:12.386
and in their dogged pursuits

02:12.422 --> 02:15.389
would end up paying a terrible price,

02:15.425 --> 02:18.993
searching for truths
as I parceled them out,

02:19.028 --> 02:23.064
truths held only by the few
who know the levers of power

02:23.099 --> 02:25.966
and the invisible hand controlling them.

02:26.002 --> 02:28.636
Is there life out there? Good heavens.

02:28.671 --> 02:31.405
To doubt it is a failure
of more than the imagination.

02:31.441 --> 02:33.641
It is a failure to recognize the limits

02:33.676 --> 02:35.710
of our own stupidity,

02:35.745 --> 02:39.013
the nascency of our science,
the rudiment of our tools.

02:39.048 --> 02:41.082
We listen, we search.

02:41.117 --> 02:44.151
We hope for a sign, as if our
eyes and ears are good enough,

02:44.187 --> 02:48.556
our brains large enough,
our egos small enough.

02:48.591 --> 02:50.558
I'm an old man now.

02:50.593 --> 02:53.094
I will leave my own mark upon history,

02:53.129 --> 02:55.996
more than presidents or tyrants.

02:56.032 --> 02:58.432
I don't ask for loyalty and trust,

02:58.468 --> 03:00.601
the fleeting bonds of men.

03:00.636 --> 03:04.772
I ask only for the years
to show my sons and their sons

03:04.807 --> 03:06.107
I was right.

03:06.142 --> 03:11.679
What their father did had to be done.

That's one small step for man,

03:27.663 --> 03:31.165
one giant leap for mankind.

03:33.503 --> 03:34.969
Cut.

03:35.004 --> 03:36.137

04:29.917 --> 04:32.190
_

04:46.457 --> 04:48.257
What's her heart rate?

04:48.299 --> 04:50.266
Heart rate elevated to 186 BPM.

04:50.287 --> 04:51.920
Ma'am, can you hear me?

04:51.981 --> 04:52.932
Can you hear me, ma'am?

04:53.160 --> 04:54.559
I need her blood pressure.

04:54.594 --> 04:56.327
No dilation, unresponsive.

04:56.363 --> 04:57.862
No indication of trauma.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.664
- You found her where she is?
- She must've fallen.

04:59.700 --> 05:01.466
It's me, Scully.

05:01.501 --> 05:03.134
- Can you hear me?
- She's bit her tongue,

05:03.170 --> 05:04.502
but no trauma to her head.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.071
Has she had seizures before?
Does she take meds for anything?

05:06.106 --> 05:07.238
No, no. She's perfectly healthy.

05:07.274 --> 05:08.406
She's a doctor. She would've told me.

05:08.442 --> 05:10.508
Hey, hey, hey.
We got a gurney coming in.

05:12.446 --> 05:15.046
- What happened, Agent Mulder?
- They say she had a seizure.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.882
One, two, three, lift.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.718
Gentle, gentle.

05:19.753 --> 05:22.253
Call the hospital with our ETA.

05:22.289 --> 05:23.888
Let's clear out.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.423
Coming through.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.492
I'm going with you.

05:31.531 --> 05:34.566
I just want someone to tell me
what the hell is going on here.

05:34.601 --> 05:37.602
- No news, good news, Mulder.
- That's BS, and you know it.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.070
Why don't you go outside
and get some fresh air?

05:39.106 --> 05:40.205
I'll text you when there's word.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.940
I don't want to hear it from you.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.274
I want to talk to Scully.

05:43.310 --> 05:44.743
Excuse me.

05:44.778 --> 05:47.112
Is one of you Fox Mulder?

05:47.147 --> 05:49.547
- She gonna be okay?
- I'm Dr. Joyet, her neurologist.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.283
- We've done a series of tests.
- Can you answer my question?

05:52.319 --> 05:53.785
- The answer is we don't know.
- What do you mean

05:53.820 --> 05:55.754
you don't know? What the hell
you been doing in there?

05:55.789 --> 05:57.756
Mulder, why don't you let her talk.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.959
- I want to talk to Scully.
- She's still unconscious.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.560
What I know right now

06:02.596 --> 06:05.063
is that she has extremely
abnormal brain activity.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.398
Abnormal how?

06:07.434 --> 06:09.200
I need to show you something.

06:09.236 --> 06:12.203
We ran her through
everything we have here...

06:12.239 --> 06:15.640
CTs, FMRI, the entire protocol.

06:15.675 --> 06:19.410
When I say "abnormal,"
I don't see any damage,

06:19.446 --> 06:20.945
just gross abnormality.

06:20.981 --> 06:23.047
The brain is a very complex organ,

06:23.083 --> 06:24.749
a cascading series of subsets

06:24.785 --> 06:27.418
that begin and end
with the prefrontal cortex.

06:27.454 --> 06:29.487
The part that makes us human.

06:29.523 --> 06:32.390
What you're seeing right now
is the PFC in real time,

06:32.425 --> 06:34.793
and the reason I don't have
any answers for you is

06:34.828 --> 06:36.961
I've never seen anything
quite like this before.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.563
- What's this here?
- The hypothalamus.

06:38.598 --> 06:41.266
The area we associate
with fight-or-flight.

06:41.301 --> 06:42.834
I don't know what I'm looking at,

06:42.869 --> 06:45.603
but I'm reading this part, the signal,

06:45.639 --> 06:47.605
I mean, I'm reading
this flashing as code.

06:47.641 --> 06:50.275
- You must be mistaken.
- What do you mean, "code"?

06:50.310 --> 06:52.277
Six dots, two dashes.

06:52.312 --> 06:53.511
"Him."

06:53.547 --> 06:57.015
"Find him."

06:57.050 --> 06:59.050
This is insanity.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.620
I want to see her.

07:12.732 --> 07:14.532
Can she hear us?

07:14.568 --> 07:17.635
What she needs right now is quiet, rest.

07:17.671 --> 07:20.638
Neurologically speaking,
her brain's on fire.

07:20.674 --> 07:22.707
I'm sure that's what she needs.

07:22.742 --> 07:24.576
But I'm gonna stay here.

07:25.679 --> 07:29.080
Mulder, a moment outside?

07:35.188 --> 07:37.388
You're not helping your cause.

07:37.424 --> 07:40.191
- Are you helping my cause?
- What if it was a message?

07:40.227 --> 07:42.026
Find who? It's absurd.

07:42.062 --> 07:45.663
Who would you be asking for? Your son.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.400
Well, why ask for him now?

07:51.605 --> 07:54.305
- She's not dying.
- Maybe she's not.

07:54.341 --> 07:55.907
But I've seen you believe

07:55.942 --> 07:58.076
far more absurd things, Agent Mulder.

07:58.111 --> 08:00.178
Far less personal.

08:02.549 --> 08:04.682
Hey.

08:04.718 --> 08:07.185
I care about her, too.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.420
I'm just looking for answers here.

08:09.456 --> 08:11.756
Then you go look for them, Skinner.

08:11.791 --> 08:13.958
Where I'm needed is in there.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.903
The thought is imperishable,

08:24.938 --> 08:26.905
a fear that takes hold in the gut,

08:26.940 --> 08:29.240
that the person you care for
most in the world

08:29.276 --> 08:31.776
could be hurt by you.

08:31.811 --> 08:33.544
By your actions.

08:33.580 --> 08:36.014
The simple fact of knowing you.

08:36.049 --> 08:38.249
As she lies here, so helpless,

08:38.284 --> 08:42.352
those same thoughts and fears
flood my mind with questions.

08:42.389 --> 08:46.391
If I caused this,
how then can I make it stop?

08:55.235 --> 08:57.402
You think you know who I am.

08:57.437 --> 08:58.803
I thought that you were dead.

08:58.838 --> 08:59.904
Massive contagions. Alien DNA.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.539
The Spartan Virus.

09:01.574 --> 09:04.142
You'll be dead yourself within a week.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.153
Mulder.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.421
Scully.

09:18.858 --> 09:20.658
Mulder, you have to go.

09:20.694 --> 09:23.161
I'm not going anywhere.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.296
To find the Smoking Man.

09:25.332 --> 09:28.299
Scully, I'm gonna get your doctor.

09:28.335 --> 09:31.069
No, listen to me. I've seen it.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.904
You've seen what, Scully?

09:32.939 --> 09:36.107
I know how it begins.

09:36.142 --> 09:39.010
There's a virus. The Spartan Virus.

09:39.045 --> 09:42.680
It shuts down our immune systems,

09:42.716 --> 09:46.084
- and it starts a pandemic.
- Scully, you had a seizure.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.853
You-you have extremely
abnormal brain activity.

09:48.888 --> 09:52.290
No, a plague is released.
But there's a cure.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.692
Mulder, I'm absolutely certain
about this.

09:54.728 --> 09:57.695
Okay. Tell me what you saw.

09:59.065 --> 10:01.165
You're dying, Mulder.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.001
But I can't save you.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.269
Not without stem cells from our son.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.872
Scully, I'm fine. I'm here.

10:07.907 --> 10:10.441
There's no plague.
You don't need to save me.

10:10.477 --> 10:12.377
The Smoking Man is behind it.

10:12.412 --> 10:14.345
- Smoking Man is dead.
- No.

10:14.381 --> 10:17.281
No, he's not. He's alive.

10:17.317 --> 10:20.885
And he's in Spartanburg,
South Carolina, Mulder,

10:20.920 --> 10:24.455
from where he unleashes hell on Earth.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.791
Scully, I don't doubt you,

10:26.826 --> 10:28.826
that you believe what you've seen.

10:28.862 --> 10:32.130
But the-the doctor said that
your brain is on fire and...

10:32.165 --> 10:34.832
It's me, Mulder.

10:34.868 --> 10:38.169
I'm not an irrational person.

10:38.204 --> 10:39.971
You have to find him.

10:40.006 --> 10:44.342
And you have to stop him
before he kills you.

10:46.279 --> 10:49.747
I'm gonna talk
to your doctor first. Okay?

11:45.238 --> 11:46.737
Where's the boy?

11:46.773 --> 11:49.640
All we want is the boy!

12:01.955 --> 12:03.588
I don't doubt the visions.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.623
It's their specific etiology.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.758
Well, I call them visions,
but my experience of them

12:07.794 --> 12:09.293
was very real.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.295
Real is a subjective judgment.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.764
If you believe them to be real,
then they're real to you.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.167
The question is
where these visions came from.

12:16.202 --> 12:18.669
- If the seizure caused them.
- Or the exact opposite.

12:18.705 --> 12:20.304
If the seizure was caused
by the visions.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.140
I don't understand the difference.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.641
Let's just say we're verging
on the fringes

12:23.676 --> 12:25.143
of accepted neurology.

12:25.178 --> 12:29.013
You mean you think
her visions have a source?

12:29.048 --> 12:31.449
This is rather sensitive territory.

12:33.353 --> 12:36.420
I don't have to tell you
that we live at the nexus

12:36.456 --> 12:38.322
of certain government agencies...

12:38.358 --> 12:41.159
the CIA, DIA, NSA, DARPA...

12:41.194 --> 12:44.195
doing experiments on the mind
even before the Cold War.

12:44.230 --> 12:47.298
- We have files on all that.
- I've had certain patients,

12:47.333 --> 12:50.134
products of these experiments,
casualties.

12:50.170 --> 12:53.271
I've also seen things that could
only be described as superhuman.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.673
I'm not a part of any experiment.

12:55.708 --> 12:57.275
But you may have been.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.143
You said there's a man behind this.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.549
- I need to get out of here.
- Scully.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.384
I have to get to the bottom
of this, Mulder.

13:06.419 --> 13:10.354
Scully, I'm on this. I'm on it.

13:21.172 --> 13:23.138
_

13:24.633 --> 13:26.980
_

13:37.016 --> 13:38.082
Why is this happening now?

13:38.117 --> 13:39.684
You say Mulder's coming for you.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.085
This is going to go down badly.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.821
But we are not to be found.

13:50.697 --> 13:52.263
Mulder, it's Jeffrey Spender.

13:52.298 --> 13:54.832
Someone's looking for your son,
for William.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.701
They came after me in my home.

13:56.736 --> 13:58.669
You may all be in danger.

13:58.705 --> 14:01.205
They will be coming for me.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.714
Mulder will be coming for me.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.785
If he finds me, he'll kill me.

14:21.227 --> 14:23.828
But we are not to be found.

14:31.881 --> 14:33.447
If Scully was a conduit,

14:33.510 --> 14:36.128
if her abnormal brain activity
was triggered

14:36.138 --> 14:38.138
by some external agency,

14:38.161 --> 14:40.762
who or what had reason
to put her through the trauma?

14:40.797 --> 14:44.732
For what purpose and
to what end was she suffering?

14:44.768 --> 14:47.702
Scully's story would be
incredible outright...

14:47.737 --> 14:50.738
a dead man unleashing
a plague on the world,

14:50.774 --> 14:55.076
my impending demise, the
desperation to find our son...

14:55.111 --> 14:58.479
unbelievable, if not for the
fact that I've been followed

14:58.515 --> 15:00.248
since I left the hospital.

15:00.283 --> 15:02.417
But followed by whom?

15:10.693 --> 15:12.994
This is going to go down badly.

15:13.029 --> 15:14.962
- Certainly you've taken precautions.
- Of course.

15:14.998 --> 15:17.632
I've been at this too long
not to have my alternatives.

15:43.793 --> 15:46.627
You know Mulder. He's determined.

15:46.663 --> 15:49.130
Determined to what? Stop me?

15:49.165 --> 15:51.699
He can't stop what's already begun.

17:21.156 --> 17:23.023
William. Our son.

17:23.059 --> 17:24.425
Your child is part alien.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.694
You take him from us.

17:26.729 --> 17:29.897
Scully. Agent Scully.

17:29.933 --> 17:32.266
Agent Scully.

17:32.302 --> 17:35.536
- What are you doing here?
- I've taken a risk coming here.

17:35.572 --> 17:37.772
- What is it, Spender?
- Someone came at me.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.974
- What do you mean, came at you?
- Trying to find your son.

17:40.009 --> 17:42.810
- What did you tell them?
- I didn't tell them anything,

17:42.845 --> 17:44.779
but they'll be coming at me again.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.614
I need to know where he is.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.583
You made me promise to hide your son.

17:48.618 --> 17:50.785
To never tell you, to never
tell anyone where he was.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.453
Your son was never to be found.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.655
I know. I'm asking you
to break that promise.

17:54.691 --> 17:57.625
- What if they come at you?
- You don't understand.

17:57.660 --> 18:00.661
Mulder's life may depend on it.

18:03.967 --> 18:07.969
I only have a name, of the
adoptive parents: Van de Kamp.

18:08.004 --> 18:10.237
I want you to help me find him.

18:10.273 --> 18:11.339
- I've already broken a promise.
- No.

18:11.374 --> 18:13.975
The Smoking Man, your father.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.576
He's the one that's looking for them.

18:15.612 --> 18:17.912
- My father's dead.
- No, he's not. He's alive.

18:17.947 --> 18:19.847
- Dana, you've got to stay calm.
- I'm not gonna calm down.

18:19.882 --> 18:21.515
- You've got to stay in bed.
- I want to get out of here.

18:21.551 --> 18:23.851
Nurse, can you help me?
Miss Scully... Security!

18:23.886 --> 18:26.454
Where are my things?
Look, you can't keep me here.

18:26.489 --> 18:27.688
I fear you may seize.

18:27.724 --> 18:29.790
Just tell me where
my things are. I'm leaving.

18:35.064 --> 18:37.198
I'm concerned for Scully.

18:37.233 --> 18:39.634
If she were to fear
her boy was in danger,

18:39.669 --> 18:42.436
like Mulder, she'd stop at nothing.

18:42.472 --> 18:44.872
The boy is in danger. You said so.

18:44.907 --> 18:46.874
But I don't understand from whom.

18:46.909 --> 18:48.876
You've always had your enemies.

18:48.911 --> 18:51.112
Yes, but why go after the boy now?

18:51.147 --> 18:53.414
Maybe they know he's your weakness.

18:57.086 --> 18:59.320
They couldn't possibly know that.

18:59.355 --> 19:00.821
But suddenly everyone knows everything

19:00.857 --> 19:02.823
of you and your plans.

19:02.859 --> 19:04.158
My plans are airtight.

19:04.193 --> 19:05.993
And even if they were to get out,

19:06.029 --> 19:08.195
they would be dismissed
as so much fake news.

19:08.231 --> 19:10.131
That's the world we live in, Monica.

19:10.166 --> 19:11.532
Every day a new disaster,

19:11.567 --> 19:13.868
when the one thing
no one is prepared for

19:13.903 --> 19:15.836
will wipe the slate clean.

19:15.872 --> 19:18.472
We refuse to imagine
our impending extinction,

19:18.508 --> 19:20.675
the acceleration of the cataclysms.

19:20.710 --> 19:22.176
We've thrown science out the window

19:22.211 --> 19:25.046
in favor of scandal and opinion and cant

19:25.081 --> 19:28.315
and all manner of ridiculous untruths.

19:28.351 --> 19:30.718
Civilization a joke,

19:30.753 --> 19:34.388
and my plan merely the punch line.

19:37.193 --> 19:39.326
Were Scully's visions a prophecy

19:39.362 --> 19:40.828
playing out in real time?

19:40.863 --> 19:43.097
Just as she foretold,
the driver I'd dropped

19:43.132 --> 19:46.200
had driven me seven hours,
through three states,

19:46.235 --> 19:48.636
and across the border
into South Carolina.

19:54.811 --> 19:56.410
Scully, what's wrong?

19:56.446 --> 19:58.279
Nothing. Nothing's wrong.

19:58.314 --> 19:59.880
Then stay off the phone.

19:59.916 --> 20:01.849
It's okay, Mulder. I'm okay.

20:01.884 --> 20:04.118
No, Scully, you're not.

20:04.153 --> 20:05.720
Just listen to me, Mulder.

20:05.755 --> 20:07.688
Jeffrey Spender came to me.

20:07.724 --> 20:09.290
What are you talking about?

20:09.325 --> 20:11.625
He gave me a name, how to find our son.

20:11.661 --> 20:13.060
- No...
- Something to start on.

20:13.096 --> 20:14.562
You can't be doing this now, Scully.

20:14.597 --> 20:15.896
I need to, Mulder.

20:15.932 --> 20:18.132
I've seen how it happens
and how it ends.

20:18.167 --> 20:20.568
- Where are you?
- I don't want you to worry.

20:20.603 --> 20:22.403
Scully, where are you?

20:22.438 --> 20:25.372
Standing at your desk.

20:25.408 --> 20:27.742
No, it... it's not worth it.

20:27.777 --> 20:29.577
Mulder, I know what I'm doing.

20:29.612 --> 20:31.245
Damn it, Scully.

20:31.280 --> 20:32.980
Where are you?

20:33.015 --> 20:36.083
I'm passing into South Carolina.
I'm following a guy.

20:37.587 --> 20:39.954
This is what I saw, Mulder.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.889
How it begins.

20:41.924 --> 20:45.392
The confrontation between you
and the Smoking Man.

20:45.428 --> 20:48.295
All right, look,
I want you to listen to me.

20:48.331 --> 20:51.565
No. This is why you need William.

20:51.601 --> 20:54.635
- Why I need to find him.
- I'm gonna call Skinner.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.604
I need you to just stay put, okay?

20:56.639 --> 20:58.839
I have to find our son.

20:58.875 --> 21:00.274
You need him.

21:00.309 --> 21:01.909
And I need you.

21:01.944 --> 21:04.411
Oh. Oh.

21:04.447 --> 21:07.681
Scully? Scully?

21:07.717 --> 21:09.283
Find me the boy.

21:09.318 --> 21:11.252
What does he want with my son?

21:11.287 --> 21:13.154
He's a very special child.

21:13.189 --> 21:16.257
The threat is that you'll never
see your son again.

21:16.292 --> 21:19.226
What... is happening?

21:38.351 --> 21:39.717
You think Scully will forgive you?

21:39.752 --> 21:41.952
She'll come to see the beauty of it.

21:41.988 --> 21:45.823
The beauty of a planet
returned to its savage state.

21:45.858 --> 21:47.825
Living as we were intended.

21:47.860 --> 21:49.960
These are people you're killing.

21:49.996 --> 21:51.862
I'm just cleaning the mess
that they made.

21:51.898 --> 21:54.198
Doesn't mean we won't hate you.

21:54.233 --> 21:56.901
I've endured more hatred
than you'll ever know.

21:56.936 --> 21:59.203
My enemies are legion.

22:01.107 --> 22:03.073
What price was Scully now paying

22:03.109 --> 22:05.476
for her visions and her certainties?

22:05.511 --> 22:09.046
And what price would I pay for
not turning back to help her?

22:09.081 --> 22:13.817
All I could do was heed her admonitions.

22:13.853 --> 22:17.688
Scully and her boy have a bond
beyond you, beyond science.

22:17.723 --> 22:20.024
She's completely unaware of that.

22:20.059 --> 22:21.892
Really? What makes you so certain?

22:21.928 --> 22:24.595
It's a secret only you and I know.

22:26.565 --> 22:29.400
I was running on only adrenaline

22:29.435 --> 22:31.168
and Scully's premonitions.

22:31.203 --> 22:34.338
But was it hope I should be feeling

22:34.373 --> 22:36.941
or fear that Scully was right,

22:36.976 --> 22:41.111
and a man I'd come to despise...
my own father... was alive?

22:41.147 --> 22:44.848
And if he were,
he'd become mad with power.

22:44.884 --> 22:48.852
I owe it to Scully now
to find out the truth.

22:48.888 --> 22:51.455
I fear only for Scully and the boy,

22:51.490 --> 22:53.724
and the harm my enemies
may bring on them.

22:53.759 --> 22:55.793
I think you're in love with her.

22:58.831 --> 23:00.798
I worry for her.

23:00.833 --> 23:03.200
I always had Mulder to protect her.

23:03.235 --> 23:05.636
But now he's going to force my hand.

23:05.671 --> 23:07.638
You won't shed a tear for Mulder.

23:07.673 --> 23:09.640
Of course I will. He's my son.

23:09.675 --> 23:12.009
What if Scully finds the boy first?

23:16.582 --> 23:19.516
You and I won't let that happen.

24:45.404 --> 24:47.204
Federal agent! I'm armed!

24:50.018 --> 24:52.342
Please point the gun away.

24:52.378 --> 24:53.710
Hands!

24:53.746 --> 24:55.646
Hands in the air where I can see 'em!

24:55.681 --> 24:57.648
For heaven's sake, Mr. Mulder.

24:57.683 --> 24:59.683
All you had to do was knock.

25:04.857 --> 25:06.457
Agent Scully?

25:50.603 --> 25:52.803
Both hands on the wheel.

25:52.838 --> 25:54.304
The hell is this, Monica?

25:54.340 --> 25:56.306
Me with a gun to your head.

26:19.331 --> 26:21.265
Mind if I smoke?

26:47.188 --> 26:49.350
Oh, my God. Ma'am?

26:49.444 --> 26:52.269
- Ma'am, are you all right?
- Call 911!

26:52.336 --> 26:53.568
Ma'am, are you all right?

26:53.603 --> 26:55.003
Careful.

26:56.506 --> 26:57.739
- Ma'am, you okay?
- Stand back.

26:57.774 --> 26:59.674
Stand back. Careful with her head.

26:59.710 --> 27:01.710
Here we go. I got you.

27:05.859 --> 27:08.693
- You've driven a long way.
- Where's the Smoking Man?

27:08.728 --> 27:10.862
- Oh, we'd hoped you'd show us.
- Answer me!

27:10.897 --> 27:13.931
- We don't know where he is.
- Then who the hell are you?

27:13.967 --> 27:17.068
My name? I don't think
it really matters at this point,

27:17.103 --> 27:18.903
do you, Mr. Mulder?

27:18.938 --> 27:22.206
And certainly I think I must
apologize for the imposition.

27:22.242 --> 27:23.908
We can tell you this.

27:23.943 --> 27:26.678
He was here, not long ago.

27:26.713 --> 27:29.380
We smoked too much, we drank
too much in the Foreign Service.

27:29.416 --> 27:33.217
- Your erstwhile father led the way.
- Answer my question.

27:33.253 --> 27:36.054
We were all part of a syndicate
involved in alien colonization.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.755
Surely you knew about this business.

27:37.791 --> 27:41.359
- You're conspirators.
- Not at all. Quite the opposite.

27:41.394 --> 27:42.694
Go.

27:42.729 --> 27:44.729
It's okay, Mr. Mulder.

27:44.764 --> 27:48.533
Our man here won't be
troubling you any longer.

27:48.568 --> 27:51.302
- This is my associate.
- I see.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.304
Nobody has a name.

27:53.339 --> 27:56.207
- We've all had many names.
- You want to see me snap?

27:56.242 --> 27:58.910
Oh, I don't think you're gonna
fire that gun, Mr. Mulder.

27:58.945 --> 28:00.645
You haven't heard what I have to say.

28:00.680 --> 28:03.715
Let me cut to the point:
the man we're both looking for

28:03.750 --> 28:05.950
- is bent on...
- Hell-bent is what he is.

28:05.985 --> 28:08.619
...on exterminating humanity.

28:08.655 --> 28:11.055
You'll be pleased to know, Mr. Skinner,

28:11.091 --> 28:12.957
I'm here to offer you a deal.

28:12.992 --> 28:16.160
- I don't make deals.
- This is a waste of time.

28:16.196 --> 28:19.564
You're still a fairly young man.
Years to live, by my estimation.

28:19.599 --> 28:23.267
Try me, you son of a bitch.
I'm the one with a gun.

28:25.171 --> 28:28.606
Not so long ago,
mankind's greatest threats were

28:28.641 --> 28:30.641
war, famine and plague.

28:30.677 --> 28:33.010
We've all but conquered them
with hard science...

28:33.046 --> 28:36.981
this faith in technology
our new religion...

28:37.016 --> 28:42.153
when a simple pathogen would
kill billions and billions.

28:43.690 --> 28:45.957
Your immune system will go first,

28:45.992 --> 28:48.626
but this is what will finally kill you.

28:50.663 --> 28:52.663
And you're a party to this?

28:54.868 --> 28:57.268
His plan is already in motion.

28:57.303 --> 28:59.470
The aliens are not coming, Mr. Mulder,

28:59.506 --> 29:01.372
just so you understand.

29:01.407 --> 29:05.309
No interest in a warming planet
with vanishing resources.

29:05.345 --> 29:08.880
- So just unleash a plague?
- This is no ordinary contagion.

29:08.915 --> 29:10.882
This is an alien pathogen.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.884
The end of history, Mr. Mulder.

29:12.919 --> 29:14.886
And why you have to kill him.

29:14.921 --> 29:17.989
The threat is that you'll never
see your son again.

29:20.493 --> 29:22.393
What are you offering me?

29:22.428 --> 29:24.729
Immunity to it.

29:24.764 --> 29:26.063
In return for what?

29:26.099 --> 29:28.566
Find me the boy, Mr. Skinner.

29:31.070 --> 29:33.204
- He needs the boy, Mr. Mulder.
- He'll never find him.

29:33.239 --> 29:35.039
You doubt his determination?

29:35.074 --> 29:37.842
- He'll use those closest to you.
- What does he want with my son?

29:37.877 --> 29:39.510
That's the question, isn't it?

29:39.546 --> 29:42.780
He's clearly a very special child.

29:46.753 --> 29:48.853
Why the hell do you care?

29:48.888 --> 29:51.155
We want to save humanity.

29:51.191 --> 29:53.324
He used to want the same.

29:53.359 --> 29:57.161
The aliens came to study us,

29:57.197 --> 29:59.063
were prepared to work with us.

29:59.098 --> 30:01.699
He was to be the man to lead us.

30:01.734 --> 30:03.835
But he became destructive.

30:03.870 --> 30:06.204
He took only his own counsel.

30:06.239 --> 30:09.273
Understand,

30:09.309 --> 30:11.709
I protected mankind as long
as I could, Mr. Skinner.

30:11.744 --> 30:14.212
- Oh, I see. So you're the hero?
- No one would listen.

30:14.247 --> 30:16.781
The aliens brought not only technology.

30:19.652 --> 30:22.386
They brought the seeds
of our destruction.

30:22.422 --> 30:24.922
It's what our government
would never grasp.

30:24.958 --> 30:28.526
And while they were adventuring
in Cuba and Vietnam

30:28.561 --> 30:32.530
and in Central America, I was
busy in the Nevada desert,

30:32.565 --> 30:34.265
dissecting, reverse engineering,

30:34.300 --> 30:38.703
playing God with life-forms,
the stuff of science fiction.

30:38.738 --> 30:41.706
I had the time,
the money and the freedom

30:41.741 --> 30:44.408
to plan for a day I knew would come.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.379
You have no idea

30:48.414 --> 30:51.749
this man's need to control
our fate, how effective and bold

30:51.784 --> 30:54.819
his plots and ambitions.

30:54.854 --> 30:57.622
Oh, my gosh. We did it.

30:57.657 --> 31:00.391
That's really the moon?

31:00.426 --> 31:01.893
Yes, that's really the moon, Jeffrey!

31:01.928 --> 31:03.961
That's how heroes are made.

31:03.997 --> 31:05.730
Roger, how does it look?

31:07.600 --> 31:09.500
It's the fourth turning, Mr. Skinner.

31:09.535 --> 31:11.836
Civilization is in its final stages.

31:11.871 --> 31:13.671
Alliances are crumbling.

31:13.706 --> 31:16.007
Truth is fluid and alterable.

31:16.042 --> 31:18.476
The only truth left is to survive it.

31:18.511 --> 31:20.845
And who chooses? You?

31:20.880 --> 31:22.747
There are people with immunity.

31:22.782 --> 31:25.283
Agent Scully has it. And her son.

31:25.318 --> 31:27.518
They'll survive with a select few.

31:27.553 --> 31:29.954
What about Agent Mulder?

31:29.989 --> 31:31.822
Kill him,

31:31.858 --> 31:33.791
before he kills us all.

31:33.826 --> 31:36.127
You're his son, Mr. Mulder.

31:36.162 --> 31:37.862
He won't be expecting you.

31:37.897 --> 31:39.597
You know what I think?

31:39.632 --> 31:42.667
That's only half the story.

31:42.702 --> 31:44.201
He wants to exterminate humanity.

31:44.237 --> 31:45.703
What's your budding enterprise?

31:45.738 --> 31:47.538
The colonization of space.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.540
We're closer than you think.

31:49.575 --> 31:51.275
Building Dyson spheres

31:51.311 --> 31:53.611
and magnificent habitable structures.

31:53.646 --> 31:56.380
Oh.

31:56.416 --> 31:58.950
That's the plan.

31:58.985 --> 32:01.052
A secret space program?

32:01.087 --> 32:02.753
I don't think so.

32:05.191 --> 32:06.857
I think this is a power play.

32:06.893 --> 32:10.194
You want me to kill him so
you can implement your own plan.

32:10.229 --> 32:11.896
You want to see blood in the streets.

32:11.931 --> 32:15.666
The colonization of space?
How do you plan to do that?

32:15.702 --> 32:17.234
Transport all humanity off-planet?

32:17.270 --> 32:19.003
Seven billion people?
That's not possible.

32:19.038 --> 32:20.972
Only a chosen few.

32:21.007 --> 32:22.573
And you call him evil?

32:22.608 --> 32:26.043
We can take you with us,
Mr. Mulder, you and your boy.

32:26.079 --> 32:27.979
You're a liar. You're all liars.

32:28.014 --> 32:30.715
Then no one can save us.

32:30.750 --> 32:33.217
I know someone who can save us.

32:33.252 --> 32:35.453
And I think you know her, too.

32:37.357 --> 32:40.024
Now get out of my way.

32:41.361 --> 32:43.527
I think we're finished here.

32:45.298 --> 32:49.300
Get your ass back in the car.
I'm not finished.

33:15.778 --> 33:18.045
Come on, pick up the phone.

33:20.316 --> 33:23.017
Why do you want the boy?

33:23.052 --> 33:26.354
He's very important to me.

33:26.389 --> 33:27.755
You're asking me to betray them,

33:27.790 --> 33:29.357
to betray people that I care about.

33:29.392 --> 33:31.258
No, no, no.

33:31.294 --> 33:34.495
I'm asking you to turn your back
on the whole human race.

33:36.899 --> 33:39.166
Come on!

33:48.411 --> 33:51.812
Are you the FBI agents?
I came as quickly as I could.

33:51.848 --> 33:53.347
From what I understand,

33:53.383 --> 33:55.216
Agent Einstein may have saved her life.

33:55.251 --> 33:57.518
- How'd you even find her?
- We were pulling into the FBI

33:57.553 --> 33:59.286
when we saw her car take the hit.

33:59.322 --> 34:02.023
- And you knew to bring her here?
- From her medical bracelet.

34:02.058 --> 34:04.725
Well, she's lucky
you found her when you did.

34:16.039 --> 34:18.072
- Hello?
- I just wanted to tell you

34:18.107 --> 34:20.041
she's here, in case you were worried.

34:22.879 --> 34:24.512
- Where's "here"?
- The hospital.

34:24.547 --> 34:28.049
She had an accident,
and we're monitoring her.

34:31.187 --> 34:32.987
Night nurse coordinator,

34:33.022 --> 34:34.889
extension 4301.

34:34.924 --> 34:38.292
Night nurse coordinator, extension 4301.

36:24.133 --> 36:26.100
The horror I'd felt,

36:26.135 --> 36:27.868
the gut-wrench of seeing Scully fighting

36:27.904 --> 36:30.971
against a storm in her head,
now only doubled.

36:31.007 --> 36:33.607
Had I come full circle to find the truth

36:33.643 --> 36:36.777
or only to uncover greater lies?

36:36.812 --> 36:39.146
Not one conspiracy, but two,

36:39.182 --> 36:42.149
that threatened
not only Scully, but our son.

36:42.185 --> 36:45.352
A drum beats in my heart.

36:59.001 --> 37:04.071
That man they just wheeled out
on a gurney... I know that man.

37:04.106 --> 37:06.307
The Smoking Man didn't send him.

37:06.342 --> 37:08.842
How do you know that?

37:08.878 --> 37:11.979
Because the Smoking Man won't harm me.

37:12.014 --> 37:15.216
He's held my life in his hands.

37:15.251 --> 37:19.353
That... was something else.

37:21.424 --> 37:24.491
Your visions, Scully.

37:24.527 --> 37:26.160
They're not wrong.

37:26.195 --> 37:30.831
My visions... are from William.

37:30.866 --> 37:33.601
I don't know how,

37:33.636 --> 37:35.936
but I know that he's guiding me.

37:35.972 --> 37:37.938
And you.

37:39.875 --> 37:41.842
They're looking for him.

37:41.877 --> 37:44.945
The Smoking Man can't act
without William.

37:44.981 --> 37:47.214
I know that in my bones.

37:47.250 --> 37:50.784
And William knows it.

37:50.820 --> 37:52.786
They won't find him.

37:52.822 --> 37:54.488
But he will find us.

37:57.226 --> 38:01.128
So we... just wait?

38:01.163 --> 38:03.063
Do nothing?

38:05.501 --> 38:07.501
We do our work.

38:09.672 --> 38:12.973
The truth still lies
in the X-Files, Mulder.

38:19.015 --> 38:21.982
They said you were attacked.

38:22.018 --> 38:24.051
I was calling you.

38:24.086 --> 38:25.819
I didn't get your call.

38:25.855 --> 38:28.656
Where have you been, Skinner?

38:28.691 --> 38:31.225
- Where you been?
- Leave it alone, Mulder.

38:31.260 --> 38:33.994
- I asked you to look for her.
- And I looked for her.

38:34.030 --> 38:36.063
Where'd you look?

38:36.098 --> 38:37.498
I said leave it alone.

38:37.533 --> 38:40.334
You smell like smoke.

38:41.671 --> 38:43.037
Mulder.

38:49.312 --> 38:51.178
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Break it up, break it up.

38:51.213 --> 38:52.980
Break it up.

38:53.015 --> 38:55.516
Whose side are you on?

38:55.551 --> 38:57.951
I said leave it alone, Mulder.

39:00.122 --> 39:02.222
What are you hiding?

39:05.061 --> 39:06.860
What could possibly make you think

39:06.896 --> 39:08.762
that I would ever take your deal?

39:08.798 --> 39:10.364
You're not betraying Scully.

39:10.399 --> 39:12.199
She'll be with us. She's immune.

39:12.234 --> 39:14.101
Hey, you really get off
on this, don't you?

39:14.136 --> 39:16.103
Manufacturing destiny?

39:16.138 --> 39:17.538
Then why kill Mulder?

39:17.573 --> 39:19.006
Mulder would kill me.

39:19.041 --> 39:22.443
Scully will never take your offer.

39:22.478 --> 39:25.446
- Of course she'll take it.
- Not without Mulder, she won't.

39:25.481 --> 39:27.781
I'll present her with a simple choice.

39:27.817 --> 39:30.951
Mulder or her only son.

39:30.986 --> 39:32.820
So this is just vengeance?

39:32.855 --> 39:34.355
Oh, it's more than that.

39:35.858 --> 39:38.292
Dana and I have a history.

39:38.327 --> 39:42.696
A very important history
that goes back 17 years.

39:47.870 --> 39:50.571
I'm glad you came.

39:50.606 --> 39:52.639
We'll need to take a trip.

39:52.675 --> 39:55.175
I'm here.

39:55.211 --> 39:56.610
It'll require a few days.

40:13.863 --> 40:15.095
You drugged me.

40:15.131 --> 40:17.231
I did nothing of the sort.

40:17.266 --> 40:20.367
How the hell did I get
out of my clothes and into bed?

40:20.403 --> 40:22.102
We carried you, my housekeeper and I.

40:22.138 --> 40:24.938
You'd been up for over 30 hours;
you were delirious.

40:24.974 --> 40:26.940
You can ask her.

40:26.976 --> 40:29.610
I don't know what you're up to.

40:29.645 --> 40:32.012
You impregnated her?

40:32.047 --> 40:35.215
With science, Mr. Skinner.

40:35.251 --> 40:37.785
Alien science.

40:37.820 --> 40:41.021
To create the first superhuman child.

40:41.056 --> 40:42.423
Mulder's not the father?

40:45.561 --> 40:47.861
I'm asking.

40:47.897 --> 40:49.763
Who's the father?

40:51.434 --> 40:54.635
I am. William is my son.
