A report by this entertainment
industry analyst released today

02:34.160 --> 02:36.856
showed a severe drop
in the summer box office results

02:36.860 --> 02:38.555
of the major studios.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.824
A Warner Brothers' spokesman
"poo-poo'd" the projections--

02:40.830 --> 02:41.421
(turning tv off)

03:28.700 --> 03:30.827
( collapsing sound )

03:39.330 --> 03:40.558

03:40.560 --> 03:42.357

MISS PREVIN ?

03:42.360 --> 03:45.090
MISS PREVIN,
ARE YOU IN THERE ?

03:45.100 --> 03:47.796
IT'S GEORGE,
THE BUILDING MANAGER.

03:47.800 --> 03:51.349
( female )
YOU KNOW, I STARTED TO
SMELL SOMETHING A FEW DAYS AGO,

03:51.360 --> 03:53.396
BUT I JUST THOUGHT SOMEONE
WAS COOKING CABBAGE.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.595
SEE, YOU CAN
STILL SMELL IT,

03:55.600 --> 03:57.124
I'M NOT CRAZY.

03:57.130 --> 03:59.121
OH, MY GOD !

04:15.930 --> 04:18.023
I'M JUST SURPRISED.

04:18.030 --> 04:19.793
WHY, I TOLD YOU
I WAS GONNA WRITE A BOOK.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.449
NO, YOU DIDN'T.

04:21.460 --> 04:24.156
I THOUGHT I DID.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.257
WHAT ?

04:26.260 --> 04:27.693
I NEED TO GET
IN THERE.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.498
SO, YOU'RE JUST GONNA
SIT DOWN TODAY

04:30.500 --> 04:31.819
AND START WRITING ?

04:31.830 --> 04:33.525
YEAH, I THINK THAT'S
HOW IT'S USUALLY DONE.

04:33.530 --> 04:36.351
OH, EXCEPT
FOR HEMINGWAY.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.759
HE STOOD.

04:41.060 --> 04:42.357
WHAT ?

04:42.360 --> 04:44.021
I NEED TO GET
IN THERE NOW.

04:47.200 --> 04:50.658
WHAT, YOU THINK
I CAN'T WRITE A BOOK ?

04:50.660 --> 04:52.218
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.950
IT'S JUST
A BOOK IS SO...

04:55.960 --> 04:57.029
BIG.

04:57.030 --> 04:59.191
NOT ALL OF THEM.

04:59.200 --> 05:02.294
WELL, IT'S JUST,
THE LAST TIME WE TALKED ABOUT
YOU DOING SOMETHING NEW,

05:02.300 --> 05:04.359
YOU MENTIONED GE'I'I'ING
SOME OF BILLY'S FRIENDS

05:04.360 --> 05:05.793
TO HELP YOU OPEN
AN ART GALLERY.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.756
YEAH, WELL,
I GOT TO THINKING,

05:07.760 --> 05:10.149
I DON'T NEED
TO HELP OTHER PEOPLE
EXPRESS THEMSELVES.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.855
I SHOULD
DO IT MYSELF.

05:13.060 --> 05:14.948
WELL, I THINK
THIS IS GREAT.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.428
CHARLOTTE
FINALLY SPEAKS.

05:17.430 --> 05:18.897
THE STORY OF YOUR
FUCKED UP CHILDHOOD,

05:18.900 --> 05:20.527
BUT FROM
YOUR POINT OF VIEW.

05:20.530 --> 05:21.929
PEOPLE WILL WANT
TO READ THAT.

05:21.930 --> 05:23.158
NO WAY !

05:23.160 --> 05:24.457
I'M NOT GONNA
WRITE A MEMOIR.

05:24.460 --> 05:26.599
WELL, WHAT
IS IT THEN ?

05:26.600 --> 05:28.227
FICTION.

05:28.230 --> 05:29.629
REALLY ?

05:35.760 --> 05:37.796
THAT'S SO AMBITIOUS,
I LOVE IT.

05:38.700 --> 05:40.588
HEY, I HOPE
I'M GONNA BE IN IT,

05:40.600 --> 05:42.750
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO BE THINLY VEILED.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.352
YOU MIGHT BE IN IT.

05:44.360 --> 05:47.158
IF YOU EVER DO
ANYTHING INTERESTING.

05:51.300 --> 05:52.653
I NEED HELP.

05:52.660 --> 05:55.788
DO YOU THINK THE HAIR
ON MR. PETERSON'S
FOREARMS IS SEXY ?

05:55.800 --> 05:57.825
OR IS IT
TOO UNKEMPT ?

05:57.830 --> 05:59.650
SOMETIMES
HE GETS ALL "TUFI'Y".

05:59.660 --> 06:01.127
I REALLY DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

06:01.130 --> 06:03.428
THIS WEEKEND IS MY LAST CHANCE
TO TAKE THE S.A.T.'s,

06:03.430 --> 06:05.022
AND I HAVE
TO DO WELL ON THEM.

06:05.030 --> 06:06.224
JUST TAKE A BREAK.

06:06.230 --> 06:08.425
IT'LL KEEP YOU
FROM BURNING OUT.

06:09.800 --> 06:13.054
EVERY FALL I RATE
THE MALE TEACHERS'
"FUCKABILITY",

06:13.060 --> 06:15.221
I'VE BEEN DOING IT
SINCE THE SIXTH GRADE.

06:15.230 --> 06:18.757
I AM LIKE 400 TIMES
SMARTER THAN YOU.

06:18.760 --> 06:21.524
WHY AREN'T YOU PANICKING
MORE ABOUT THIS TEST THAN I AM ?

06:23.130 --> 06:25.894
I HAVE A TUTOR,
I'VE TAKEN PRACTICE TESTS.

06:25.900 --> 06:28.596
AND MY MOM'S LIFE COACH
IS ADVISING ME.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.818
YOUR MOM'S LIFE COACH ?

06:30.830 --> 06:32.593
PARKER, DO YOU
HAVE ANY IDEA

06:32.600 --> 06:34.693
WHAT A PARODY
OF YOURSELF YOU ARE ?

06:34.700 --> 06:37.021
I FEEL BAD
FOR MR. VAN KIRK.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.827
IF HE HADN'T
STOPPED WORKING OUT,

06:38.830 --> 06:41.196
HE COULD'VE EASILY
CRACKED THE TOP 10.

06:42.630 --> 06:44.393
GIVE ME THAT.

06:46.030 --> 06:48.726
GI'I'I'ERMAN'S
COMING IN AT 22 ?

06:48.730 --> 06:50.595
I WAS FEELING GENEROUS.

06:50.600 --> 06:51.749
HEY, CLAIRE.

06:51.760 --> 06:52.624
OH.

06:52.630 --> 06:53.756
GARY, HI.

06:53.760 --> 06:55.557
SEE YOU
THIS AFTERNOON ?

06:55.560 --> 06:56.959
YEP.

07:01.560 --> 07:04.028
GARY HAS
A GREAT ASS.

07:06.160 --> 07:08.549
YOU THINK HE HAS
A GREAT ASS ?

07:08.560 --> 07:12.394
YEAH, LIKE YOU
HAVEN'T NOTICED.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.751
MY MOM
CALLS THEM "BUNS".

07:15.760 --> 07:17.625
SHE IS SO NOT
OF THIS CENTURY.

07:17.630 --> 07:19.951
I DON'T CARE HOW MUCH
SHE PAYS HER LIFE COACH.

07:21.430 --> 07:23.853
I COULD FUCK GARY.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.589
EASY.

07:29.030 --> 07:30.850
SO, THIS WOMAN
IN HER 40$

07:30.860 --> 07:32.919
JUST DIED ALONE
IN HER APARTMENT ?

07:32.930 --> 07:34.955
JUST OUT OF
THE BLUE ?

07:34.960 --> 07:38.726
I MEAN, SHE MUST'VE HAD
SOME KIND OF MEDICAL CONDITION.

07:39.530 --> 07:41.919
NO, SHE CHOKED
TO DEATH.

07:41.930 --> 07:45.696
SHE LAID THERE FOR A WEEK
BEFORE ANYONE FOUND HER.

07:45.700 --> 07:47.725
WHY DIDN'T ANYBODY
NOTICE SOONER ?

07:49.200 --> 07:51.725
MAYBE THEY THOUGHT
SHE WAS ON VACATION.

07:51.730 --> 07:53.925
HERE ARE ALL THE ARRANGEMENTS
FOR HER FUNERAL.

07:53.930 --> 07:55.693
THEY'RE PRETI'Y
SELF-EXPLANATORY.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.656
YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO
TAKE CARE OF IT YOURSELF.

07:57.660 --> 07:59.651
WAIT, SHOULDN'T I TALK TO
WHOEVER'S GONNA BURY HER,

07:59.660 --> 08:00.729
SEE WHAT THEY WANT ?

08:00.730 --> 08:02.698
NATE, IT'S A PRE-NEED,
SHE BURIED HERSELF.

08:02.700 --> 08:04.156
SHE CAME IN
A FEW YEARS AGO

08:04.160 --> 08:06.094
AND BOUGHT EVERYTHING
SHE WANTED AHEAD OF TIME.

08:06.100 --> 08:07.897
YOU HAVE HER CONTACT LIST
FOR FAMILY AND FRIENDS,

08:07.900 --> 08:09.424
HER DIRECTIONS
FOR THE SERVICE,

08:09.430 --> 08:11.557
AND ALL THE SPECIFICATIONS
ABOUT HER RESTORATION.

08:11.560 --> 08:14.222
SHE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT KIND
OF SERVICE SHE WANTED.

08:14.230 --> 08:16.118
SO, YOU'LL NEED TO ORDER
THIS SHEET MUSIC

08:16.130 --> 08:17.654
FOR THE ORGANIST.

08:17.660 --> 08:20.220
"AND I AM TELLING YOU
I'M NOT GOING."

08:21.760 --> 08:23.728
WELL, SHE CERTAINLY
HAD A SENSE OF HUMOR.

08:23.730 --> 08:25.823
WHAT SONG IS THAT ?

08:25.830 --> 08:28.128
IT'S FROM "DREAMGIRLS",
YOU KNOW IT...

08:28.130 --> 08:32.157
AND I AM TELLING YOU,
I AM NOT GOIN'

08:32.160 --> 08:33.752
YOU'RE THE BEST MAN

08:33.760 --> 08:35.819
"I'VE EVER KNOWN ."

08:37.230 --> 08:40.791
IT MUST BE REALLY WEIRD
TO FILL ONE OF THESE THINGS
OUT FOR YOURSELF.

08:40.800 --> 08:42.449
I HAD FUN DOING MINE.

08:58.630 --> 09:00.951
( computer beeping )

09:38.430 --> 09:41.092
WELL, I HAVE
A TEST ON MONDAY,

09:41.100 --> 09:42.954
I HAVE AN ART HISTORY PAPER
DUE NEXT WEEK,

09:42.960 --> 09:44.655
AND I KNOW I COULD DO
A GOOD JOB ON BOTH OF THEM

09:44.660 --> 09:46.491
IF I HAD MORE TIME,
BUT I DON'T.

09:47.560 --> 09:50.495
DO I HAVE SOMETHING
ON MY FACE ?

09:50.500 --> 09:52.127
NO.

09:52.130 --> 09:54.189
'CAUSE YOU'RE
GIVING ME THIS LOOK.

09:54.200 --> 09:58.057
IT'S JUST NICE TO
SEE YOU SO INVOLVED.

09:58.060 --> 10:00.324
AND YOU'RE TAKING
THE S.A.T. THIS WEEKEND ?

10:00.330 --> 10:03.322
I SAW THE BOOKS
IN THE LIBRARY.

10:03.330 --> 10:05.321
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I DIDN'T TELL YOU.

10:05.330 --> 10:06.490
IT'S OKAY.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.456
I JUST SIGNED UP FOR IT,
I WASN'T SURE IF I WOULD.

10:08.460 --> 10:11.258
IT'S GREAT, YOU'RE STARTING
TO TAKE SCHOOL MORE SERIOUSLY,

10:11.260 --> 10:13.148
AND YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE THE S.A.T.,

10:13.160 --> 10:15.025
IT SHOWS YOU'RE
NURTURING YOURSELF.

10:15.030 --> 10:16.395
GIVE ME A BREAK.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.119
I'M SO SCARED OF HAVING
MY OWN THOUGHTS

10:19.130 --> 10:20.552
OR GOING IN
MY OWN DIRECTION

10:20.560 --> 10:22.653
THAT I NEED SOME SAFETY
OR APPROVAL.

10:22.660 --> 10:25.697
I MEAN, THIS STUFF IS JUST
COP-OUT DISTRACT IONS.

10:25.700 --> 10:26.826
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

10:26.830 --> 10:29.128
THIS SESSION IS ACTUALLY
GIVING ME SOME CLARITY.

10:29.130 --> 10:31.223
I SHOULD JUST BLOW
THIS TEST OFF TOMORROW

10:31.230 --> 10:33.790
AND LOOK REALLY HARD
INSIDE MYSELF

10:33.800 --> 10:35.825
FOR WHAT
I REALLY WANT.

10:36.930 --> 10:40.491
CLAIRE, YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
FRIGHTENED BY TAKING THIS TEST,

10:40.500 --> 10:41.751
WHY ?

10:44.430 --> 10:47.319
I DON'T KNOW,
IT'S LIKE...

10:47.330 --> 10:49.457
WHEN I THINK
ABOUT THE TEST,

10:49.460 --> 10:53.351
I SEE THIS LIKE
NASTY FLUORESCENT LIGHT.

10:53.360 --> 10:56.352
THE KIND THAT SHOWS ALL
YOUR POCKMARKS AND TINY SCARS

10:56.360 --> 10:58.055
THAT YOU WISH
YOU COULD HIDE.

10:58.060 --> 10:59.823
I SEE, SO IT'S...

10:59.830 --> 11:02.594
VERY SAFE IN THE DARKNESS,
ISN'T IT ?

11:02.600 --> 11:05.592
OKAY, YOU'RE GE'I'I'ING
KIND OF CORNY.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.420
ALRIGHT.

11:07.430 --> 11:11.252
ALL I'M SAYING IS
YOU'RE FINALLY IN A PLACE

11:11.260 --> 11:13.524
WHERE YOU'RE STARTING
TO COMING INTO YOUR OWN.

11:13.530 --> 11:16.294
YOU'RE AFRAID IF PEOPLE
SEE THE REAL YOU,

11:16.300 --> 11:17.927
IT'LL BE SCARY.

11:17.930 --> 11:19.693
AND GUESS WHAT,
IT IS SCARY.

11:19.700 --> 11:22.999
FOR ALL OF US,
ISN'T IT ?

11:27.660 --> 11:29.696
DON'T BE SILLY,
DAVID.

11:29.700 --> 11:32.396
YOU DON'T NEED TO APOLOGIZE FOR
WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT "THE PLAN".

11:32.400 --> 11:35.289
IF YOU LIVE IN A NEIGHBORHOOD
FOR A LONG TIME,

11:35.300 --> 11:37.097
AND SOMEBODY MOVES IN

11:37.100 --> 11:39.295
AND RENOVATES THE HOUSE
ACROSS THE STREET,

11:39.300 --> 11:42.724
THAT COULD JUST MAKE YOU FEEL
YOUR OWN HOUSE IS SHABBY.

11:42.730 --> 11:44.322
I SEE.

11:44.330 --> 11:46.821
DID YOU JUST
INSULT ME ?

11:46.830 --> 11:47.990
OF COURSE NOT.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.524
YOU'LL SEE.

11:49.530 --> 11:51.395
WHEN YOU'RE READY,

11:51.400 --> 11:53.027
YOU'RE GOING TO
LIVE IN A PALACE.

11:53.030 --> 11:55.498
CLAIRE, WASH YOUR HANDS,
WE'RE ABOUT TO EAT.

11:55.500 --> 11:57.752
MOM, DON'T SET A PLACE FOR ME,
I'M NOT STAYING.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.194
WHO ARE YOU
HAVING DINNER WITH ?

12:00.200 --> 12:01.690
NO ONE.

12:01.700 --> 12:04.851
I'M HAVING COFFEE WITH SOMEONE
I MET AT ST. STEPHEN'S.

12:04.860 --> 12:07.522
DAVID, IF YOU HAVE A DATE,
JUST SAY IT.

12:07.530 --> 12:09.452
NOTHING EVER
GETS BUILT

12:09.460 --> 12:11.951
IF THE MATERIALS
AREN'T LABELED PROPERLY.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.894
OKAY,
I HAVE A DATE.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.323
DAVID, I'M HAVING A PROBLEM
WITH THE EMILY PREVIN FUNERAL.

12:16.330 --> 12:18.321
LET'S HEAR IT.

12:18.330 --> 12:21.026
WELL, I'VE CALLED
HER ENTIRE CONTACT LIST,

12:21.030 --> 12:24.158
AND THE FEW FRIENDS SHE LISTED
HAVE EITHER MOVED OR DIED.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.128
AND THEN SHE'S GOT
TWO DISTANT RELATIVES,

12:26.130 --> 12:27.620
ONE OF WHICH
I CAN'T REACH,

12:27.630 --> 12:29.951
AND THE OTHER HAS THIS PHOBIA
ABOUT GOING TO FUNERALS.

12:29.960 --> 12:31.450
SOME PEOPLE
ARE SO SICK.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.792
NOW WE KNOW WHY
SHE WASN'T FOUND FOR A WEEK.

12:33.800 --> 12:36.689
I DON'T THINK THIS WOMAN
HAD ANYBODY IN HER LIFE.

12:36.700 --> 12:38.019
HOW AWFUL.

12:38.030 --> 12:39.349
HAVE YOU
CALLED HER JOB

12:39.360 --> 12:41.294
TO NOTIFY HER COLLEAGUES
ABOUT THE SERVICE ?

12:41.300 --> 12:43.188
NO, SHE WORKED
AT A TEMP AGENCY.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.349
SO, SHE JUST HAD JOBS
HERE AND THERE.

12:44.360 --> 12:46.328
SHE MUST'VE HAD SOMEONE
THAT SHE FORGOT

12:46.330 --> 12:47.729
TO WRITE DOWN
ON THE LIST.

12:47.730 --> 12:49.288
TRY HER HIGH SCHOOL,
IT'S ON THE FORM.

12:49.300 --> 12:50.756
EVERYONE HAS FRIENDS
FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

12:50.760 --> 12:52.057
NO, THEY DON'T.

12:52.060 --> 12:54.290
MAYBE THEY HAVE
PEOPLE THEY TALK TO,

12:54.300 --> 12:55.858
OR EVEN
DO THINGS WITH.

12:55.860 --> 12:57.555
BUT THEY'RE NOT
REALLY FRIENDS.

12:57.560 --> 12:58.697
THEY'RE JUST FILLER.

13:00.430 --> 13:02.523
WHAT, IT'S TRUE.

13:02.530 --> 13:05.499
I WANT A GLASS
OF WINE.

13:05.500 --> 13:09.049
OH, GOD,
IT'S SO WEIRD.

13:09.060 --> 13:12.518
WHO THE HELL
WAS EMILY PREVIN ?

13:13.860 --> 13:16.556
NATE, ARE YOU OKAY ?

13:16.560 --> 13:18.494
YEAH, I'M FINE.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.821
YOUR EYES LOOK
REALLY WEIRD.

13:20.830 --> 13:23.355
YEAH, IT'S JUST
THIS MEDICATION I'M TAKING,

13:23.360 --> 13:25.726
IT MAKES ME A LITTLE DROWSY,
THAT'S ALL.

13:25.730 --> 13:27.857
HON ESTLY.

13:33.100 --> 13:34.897
MAYBE EMILY PREVIN
WAS AUTISTIC.

13:34.900 --> 13:38.119
I READ AN ARTICLE ONCE
ABOUT A HIGH-FUNCTIONING
AUTISTIC PERSON

13:38.130 --> 13:40.052
WHO DIDN'T
NEED PEOPLE.

13:40.060 --> 13:43.223
SHE JUST HAD A JOB DESIGNING
THESE BIG CATTLE SLAUGHTERHOUSES

13:43.230 --> 13:46.119
AND AT NIGHT SHE CAME HOME
AND SAT IN THIS LITTLE MACHINE

13:46.130 --> 13:48.155
THAT MADE HER FEEL LIKE
SHE WAS BEING HUGGED.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.048
THAT WAS ALL
THE INTIMACY SHE NEEDED.

13:50.060 --> 13:52.096
THAT'S REALLY
UPSETTING.

13:52.100 --> 13:55.126
I DON'T SEE WHY THIS PERSON
HAS TO BE MENTALLY ILL

13:55.130 --> 13:57.428
JUST BECAUSE SHE HAD A LIFE
THAT DOESN'T CONFORM

13:57.430 --> 13:59.625
TO SOME FAMILIAR IMAGE
WE HAVE IN OUR HEADS.

13:59.630 --> 14:02.428
MAYBE SHE WAS LIVING
THE LIFE SHE WANTED.

14:02.430 --> 14:04.921
A LIFE WITHOUT THE HASSLE
OF OTHER PEOPLE.

14:04.930 --> 14:07.251
WHAT KIND OF
A LIFE IS THAT ?!

14:11.960 --> 14:13.791
"WELL, I'M SORRY,
YOUR HONOR,

14:13.800 --> 14:16.655
BUT HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW
IT WAS YOUR CAR ?"

14:16.660 --> 14:20.198
I DON'T THINK I COULD
BE A PUBLIC DEFENDER.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.849
WELL, WHY NOT ?

14:21.860 --> 14:24.420
I JUST DON'T THINK I COULD
DEFEND PEOPLE WHO ARE GUILTY.

14:24.430 --> 14:27.456
I GUESS I COULD BE
A SOME-OF-THE-PUBLIC DEFENDER.

14:29.630 --> 14:31.848
SO, WHAT DO YOU DO ?

14:31.860 --> 14:34.693
ME, WELL MY FAMILY
OWNS A BUSINESS.

14:34.700 --> 14:37.191
ACTUALLY,
IT'S A FUNERAL HOME.

14:39.130 --> 14:41.724
BUT I GOT OUT OF THAT
REALLY QUICKLY,

14:41.730 --> 14:43.789
AND NOW
I'M IN TEXTILES.

14:43.800 --> 14:44.789
OH.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.654
I LIKE FABRIC.

14:47.760 --> 14:50.752
WELL, I HAVE TO BE
IN COURT IN THE MORNING,

14:50.760 --> 14:52.625
SO, I HAVE A LOT
OF WORK TO DO--

14:52.630 --> 14:54.621
OKAY, WELL, MAYBE WE'LL
SEE EACH OTHER AROUND.

14:54.630 --> 14:55.995
DAVID, RELAX.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.399
IT'S FINE,
I UNDERSTAND.

14:57.400 --> 14:59.254
I GUESS THERE'S NOT MUCH
OF A SPARK HERE.

14:59.260 --> 15:00.295
OH.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.518
I THOUGHT THERE WAS,
YOU DON'T ?

15:02.530 --> 15:04.350
NO, I DO.

15:04.360 --> 15:05.952
I WAS JUST...

15:05.960 --> 15:07.188
WORRIED.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.589
I'M SORRY, BEN,
I GET A LITTLE NERVOUS

15:09.600 --> 15:11.295
AT THESE THINGS.

15:11.300 --> 15:13.154
IF I SEEM AT ALL CALM,
IT'S ONLY BECAUSE

15:13.160 --> 15:14.889
I TAKE A BETA BLOCKER
BEFORE...

15:14.900 --> 15:17.027
I HAVE TO GET
IN FRONT OF A JURY,

15:17.030 --> 15:18.793
OR FIRST DATES.

15:18.800 --> 15:20.449
YOU'RE STILL NERVOUS
ON THE INSIDE,

15:20.460 --> 15:22.451
BUT YOU DON'T
SHOW IT AS MUCH.

15:22.460 --> 15:24.325
DO YOU HAVE
ANY EXTRA ?

15:24.330 --> 15:26.093
MM-MMM.

15:28.700 --> 15:31.658
LET'S GO ON
A REAL DATE NEXT TIME,

15:31.660 --> 15:33.628
LIKE FOR DINNER.

15:33.630 --> 15:35.894
OKAY, THAT WOULD
BE NICE.

15:36.900 --> 15:39.221
YOU SEEM A LITTLE...

15:39.230 --> 15:42.722
ARE YOU COMING OUT OF
A BAD BREAK-UP, OR... ?

15:42.730 --> 15:45.290
NO, I'M COMING OUT
OF A BAD CELIBACY.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.989
I WAS IN A RELATIONSHIP,
BUT THAT, UH...

15:49.000 --> 15:50.126
ENDED.

15:50.130 --> 15:54.396
WELL, WHATEVER HAPPENED,
I BLAME HIM.

15:57.960 --> 16:00.758
YOU GET YOUR SPOILED LITTLE ASS
INTO THAT BED RIGHT NOW !

16:00.760 --> 16:02.318
DO YOU HEAR ME ?!

16:02.330 --> 16:03.422
YOU SUCK !

16:03.430 --> 16:05.421
RIGHT NOW,
I MEAN IT !

16:05.430 --> 16:07.648
I'M NOT TIRED.

16:07.660 --> 16:09.651
AND WHEN I'M AT
MY REAL HOME,

16:09.660 --> 16:12.128
I DON'T HAVE TO GO TO SLEEP
UNTIL I GET TIRED.

16:12.130 --> 16:13.654
WELL, I'M GONNA
TURN OFF THE LIGHTS NOW,

16:13.660 --> 16:15.252
AND SOON
YOU'LL BE TIRED !

16:15.260 --> 16:17.421
WHAT IF
I NEVER GET TIRED ?

16:17.430 --> 16:19.591
THEN YOU'LL LAY AWAKE
FOR HOURS AND HOURS

16:19.600 --> 16:21.329
WONDERING WHY
LIFE IS SO HARD.

16:21.330 --> 16:23.127
THAT'S WHAT
THE REST OF US DO.

16:23.130 --> 16:24.688
THAT SOUNDS BORING.

16:24.700 --> 16:26.588
YOU GET
USED TO IT.

16:33.330 --> 16:34.558
HEY...

16:36.430 --> 16:39.194
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING ?

16:39.200 --> 16:42.727
LIKE, HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT STAYING HERE ?

16:42.730 --> 16:44.823
OR BEING SCARED,

16:44.830 --> 16:46.855
BECAUSE YOUR MOM'S BEEN UP
IN OAKLAND FOR SO LONG ?

16:46.860 --> 16:48.350
NO!

16:48.360 --> 16:50.555
OKAY, BUT WE DON'T KNOW
HOW LONG YOU'RE GONNA BE HERE,

16:50.560 --> 16:52.653
SO, WHY DON'T
WE BOTH TRY

16:52.660 --> 16:55.299
AND EASE UP ON EACH OTHER
A LITTLE BIT, OKAY ?

16:56.360 --> 16:59.488
YOU GUYS HAVE
BAD TOOTHPASTE.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.752
MY FIRST INSTINCT IS
TO GET ANGRY WITH HER.

17:01.760 --> 17:04.627
I OPEN MY MOUTH
AND I HEAR MY FATHER.

17:04.630 --> 17:07.622
STOP BEING
SO HARD ON YOURSELF.

17:07.630 --> 17:10.121
THAT CHILD
IS NOT EASY.

17:10.130 --> 17:13.622
I SWORE TO MYSELF
I WOULD NEVER BE LIKE HIM.

17:20.260 --> 17:22.194
I'M NOT
IN THE MOOD.

17:25.360 --> 17:27.351
FINE.

18:14.900 --> 18:16.492
GET UP !

18:18.200 --> 18:19.519
GET UP !

18:22.200 --> 18:23.599
GET UP !

19:04.960 --> 19:06.188
( phone ringing )

19:06.200 --> 19:07.121
( female )
Hello ?

19:07.130 --> 19:09.121
HI, MELISSA,
IT'S BRENDA.

19:09.130 --> 19:10.859
CHENOWETH.

19:10.860 --> 19:13.226
YOUR MASSAGE THERAPIST ?

19:13.230 --> 19:14.390
OH.

19:14.400 --> 19:15.799
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING ?

19:15.800 --> 19:18.928
LISTEN, I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF YOU HADN'T EATEN YET,

19:18.930 --> 19:21.524
if you wanted
to have lunch.

19:21.530 --> 19:24.419
ACTUALLY, I'M AT
A RESTAURANT RIGHT NOW.

19:24.430 --> 19:26.853
Oh, look,
I'm probably breaking

19:26.860 --> 19:29.124
all these client/masseuse
boundaries.

19:29.130 --> 19:31.655
SO, I'LL JUST SEE YOU AT YOUR
REGULAR APPOINTMENT TOMORROW.

19:31.660 --> 19:34.049
NO, I WAS JUST GONNA SAY
I'M BY MYSELF,

19:34.060 --> 19:35.391
I'D LOVE THE COMPANY.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.924
Thank God.

19:46.100 --> 19:48.398
OH, JESUS !

19:48.400 --> 19:51.892
UH-HUH, THIS ONE'S GONNA BE
ONE HELL OF A RIDE.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.357
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO TAKE CARE OF IT.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.896
YEAH,
WELL, DON'T BE.

19:56.900 --> 19:58.629
SHE MUST'VE BEEN
LAYING OUT FOR A WEEK OR SO

19:58.630 --> 20:00.393
IN A PARTIALLY
VENTILATED SPACE.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.721
DAMNIT, WHY CAN'T EVERYONE DIE
IN AN AIR-CONDITIONED ROOM ?

20:02.730 --> 20:05.290
HER FACE IS ALL DISCOLORED
FROM WHERE SHE WAS LAYING ON IT,

20:05.300 --> 20:07.894
NOW, THAT I CAN FIX, ALTHOUGH
IT'S GONNA TAKE ME HOURS.

20:07.900 --> 20:09.720
AND HER ABDOMEN'S
ALL DISTENDED.

20:09.730 --> 20:11.425
NOW, THIS WOMAN'S GOT
A LOT OF GAS IN THERE.

20:11.430 --> 20:12.829
WHEN I POKE A HOLE...

20:12.830 --> 20:14.650
WE'RE GONNA GET
SOME MAJOR FUMES.

20:14.660 --> 20:16.093
WHEW, NELLY.

20:16.100 --> 20:17.897
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHY I CAME IN HERE.

20:17.900 --> 20:19.856
MAYBE YOU
HAVE ALZHEIMER'S.

20:19.860 --> 20:21.157
YEAH, MAYBE.

20:30.230 --> 20:33.154
WE REALLY ARE JUST BIOLOGY,
AREN'T WE ?

20:33.160 --> 20:36.550
NATE, YOU MAY NEED
TO TALK THE FAMILY

20:36.560 --> 20:38.289
OUT OF
AN OPEN CASKET.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.552
I MEAN, THERE'S ONLY
SO MUCH I COULD DO, MAN.

20:40.560 --> 20:41.959
SHE DOESN'T
HAVE ANY FAMILY.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.359
NO ONE ?

20:43.360 --> 20:45.225
NO FRIENDS,
OR ANYBODY.

20:46.500 --> 20:49.298
I RAN AN OBITUARY
IN THE PAPER TODAY.

20:49.300 --> 20:51.427
I'M PRAYING SOMEONE WILL READ IT
AND SHOW UP TOMORROW.

20:51.430 --> 20:52.920
AH, PRE-NEED ?

20:52.930 --> 20:56.252
WELL, IF SHE WANTED
AN OPEN CASKET,

20:56.260 --> 20:57.955
WE'LL TRY
TO GIVE HER ONE.

20:57.960 --> 21:00.190
I'LL BOOST UP
THE FLUIDS

21:00.200 --> 21:02.259
AND SEE IF THAT'LL BRING
THE SWELLING DOWN,

21:02.260 --> 21:04.922
BUT THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE WE'RE
GONNA GET SOME SKIN SLIPPAGE

21:04.930 --> 21:06.397
AND THEN
WE'RE SCREWED.

21:09.200 --> 21:13.318
MAYBE SHE WAS JUST SOME
VICIOUS ASSHOLE, YOU KNOW ?

21:13.330 --> 21:16.424
JUST TWISTED
AND EVIL.

21:16.430 --> 21:18.489
MAYBE THAT'S WHY SHE DIDN'T
HAVE ANY PEOPLE IN HER LIFE.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.354
NAH.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.920
YOU CAN TELL WHAT KIND
OF LIFE PEOPLE LIVED,

21:22.930 --> 21:25.398
EVEN WHEN
THEY'RE DEAD.

21:26.900 --> 21:28.720
YEAH, SHE WAS ALRIGHT.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.394
( female )
PLEASE HAVE YOUR IDs
OUT AND READY

21:35.400 --> 21:37.755
SO THAT WE CAN
SPEED THINGS ALONG.

21:37.760 --> 21:38.954
THANK YOU.

21:38.960 --> 21:39.790
CLAIRE FISHER.

21:39.800 --> 21:40.824
ID?

21:43.930 --> 21:46.091
SIGN RIGHT HERE.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.055
NAME ?

21:47.060 --> 21:48.550
PARKER MCKEN NA.

21:48.560 --> 21:49.788
LET'S SEE...

21:49.800 --> 21:52.553
OKAY, PARKER,
SIGN HERE PLEASE ?

21:52.560 --> 21:54.494
NEXT ?

21:54.500 --> 21:57.298
( female )
DOES ANYBODY HAVE
AN EXTRA NUMBER TWO PENCIL ?

21:57.300 --> 21:58.927
HERE YOU GO.

22:01.460 --> 22:05.157
SO, IT SOUNDS LIKE A PRETTY
SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP FOR YOU.

22:05.160 --> 22:06.650
IT IS.

22:08.430 --> 22:11.024
I LOVE NATE,
I REALLY DO.

22:11.030 --> 22:15.592
BUT LATELY I FEEL
KINDA SEPARATE FROM HIM,

22:15.600 --> 22:17.818
WHICH I KNOW IS HEALTHY
ON ONE LEVEL,

22:17.830 --> 22:20.253
BUT ON ANOTHER...

22:20.260 --> 22:22.956
I KIND OF MISS
HOW IT WAS.

22:22.960 --> 22:25.121
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED
SEEING EACH OTHER

22:25.130 --> 22:26.654
AND WE WEREN'T
TOGETHER,

22:26.660 --> 22:29.857
I'D BE WONDERING,
"WHAT IS DOING" ALL DAY LONG.

22:29.860 --> 22:31.225
NOW ?

22:31.230 --> 22:33.824
I NEVER EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT.

22:35.530 --> 22:39.193
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHEN IT CHANGED,

22:39.200 --> 22:44.854
BUT AT SOME POINT,
HE BECAME LESS PRESENT WITH ME.

22:45.730 --> 22:48.119
SOMETIMES I THINK
IT'S BECAUSE

22:48.130 --> 22:50.098
I DON'T GIVE HIM ENOUGH
TO BE PRESENT FOR.

22:50.100 --> 22:53.558
BUT THEN I THINK MAYBE
HE'S NOT PRESENT BECAUSE

22:53.560 --> 22:55.892
HE KNOWS THAT IF
HE WAS REALLY PRESENT,

22:55.900 --> 22:58.357
THEN I'D LEAVE HIM.

23:01.300 --> 23:04.656
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST SO SAD THAT
YOU CAN LOVE SOMEBODY SO MUCH,

23:04.660 --> 23:07.254
AND HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO IDEA

23:11.730 --> 23:14.699
RELATIONSHIPS
ARE FUCKED.

23:14.700 --> 23:16.588
THAT'S WHAT
I ALWAYS SAY.

23:16.600 --> 23:19.956
I HAVEN'T HAD
A REAL RELATIONSHIP
IN OVER A DECADE.

23:19.960 --> 23:22.326
IS THAT BECAUSE
YOU--

23:22.330 --> 23:24.491
'CAUSE I BLOW GUYS
FOR MONEY ?

23:24.500 --> 23:26.149
I'M SO SORRY,
THAT WAS--

23:26.160 --> 23:28.799
( chuckling )
IT'S OKAY.

23:28.800 --> 23:32.327
I'VE ONLY BEEN DOING THAT
FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS.

23:32.330 --> 23:34.355
SO WHY, THEN ?

23:34.360 --> 23:36.999
I'M JUST NOT
BUILT FOR IT.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.127
SOME PEOPLE AREN'T,
I THINK.

23:39.130 --> 23:41.291
IT'S NOT HEALTHY
OR UNHEALTHY.

23:41.300 --> 23:43.495
IT JUST IS.

23:45.260 --> 23:47.057
( pager beeping )

23:47.060 --> 23:48.755
OH, SHIT.

23:52.460 --> 23:55.327
I'M BEING PAGED
BY A CLIENT.

23:56.360 --> 23:59.898
I AM NOT DRIVING OUT
TO CALABASAS IN THIS TRAFFIC.

23:59.900 --> 24:02.050
LET THE JERK
WHACK OFF.

24:03.500 --> 24:06.321
I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU COULD HAVE LUNCH.

24:06.330 --> 24:08.218
ME, TOO.

24:08.230 --> 24:12.155
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME THAT
YOU'RE SO NORMAL AROUND ME.

24:12.160 --> 24:16.699
MOST PEOPLE HAVE
PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS
ABOUT WHAT I DO.

24:16.700 --> 24:20.192
YEAH, WELL, PEOPLE CAN BE
SUCH JUDGMENTAL ASSHOLES,

24:20.200 --> 24:22.293
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TELL ME THAT.

24:22.300 --> 24:24.450
WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S WORSE ?

24:24.460 --> 24:26.018
MOST GIRLS...

24:26.030 --> 24:28.089
THEY JUST WANT
TO BE MY FRIEND

24:28.100 --> 24:30.193
SO THEY CAN PUMP ME
FOR ALL THE GORY DETAILS

24:30.200 --> 24:32.156
ABOUT BEING
A LADY OF THE EVENING.

24:32.160 --> 24:34.424
IT'S JUST QUESTION
AFTER QUESTION,

24:34.430 --> 24:36.591
LIKE I'M SOME
KIND OF FREAK.

24:40.500 --> 24:43.754
( laughing )

24:43.760 --> 24:46.923
ALRIGHT, YOU GET
THREE QUESTIONS.

24:46.930 --> 24:48.693
OH, GOODIE.

24:48.700 --> 24:50.099
THERE'S THAT ONE.

24:50.100 --> 24:53.149
NO, I THINK THAT ONE
MAKES YOU LOOK FAT.

24:53.160 --> 24:54.923
VERY FUNNY.

24:54.930 --> 24:57.194
SERIOUSLY, WHICH ONE
DO YOU THINK IS GONNA

24:57.200 --> 24:58.622
LOOK BETTER
ON MISS PREVIN ?

24:58.630 --> 25:00.188
I GUESS THE PINK ONE.

25:00.200 --> 25:03.055
DIDN'T SHE SPECIFY
WHICH CASKET GOWN SHE WANTED,
OR DID DAD SLIP UP ?

25:03.060 --> 25:04.527
DAD DIDN'T SLIP UP.

25:04.530 --> 25:06.452
SHE MARKED DOWN SHE WANTED
TO BE BURIED IN HER OWN CLOTHES.

25:06.460 --> 25:08.792
BUT THE OUTFIT SHE CAME
IN HERE WITH WAS SHOT.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.893
THEN GIVE HER THE BLUE ONE,
I'VE BEEN DYING
TO GET RID OF IT.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.527
IT'S COMING APART
IN THE BACK.

25:12.530 --> 25:13.622
DAVID !

25:13.630 --> 25:16.394
MOM, DID YOU
WANT SOMETHING ?

25:16.400 --> 25:18.425
I WAS DUSTING
YOUR CASKET WALL.

25:18.430 --> 25:21.593
IF THIS WOMAN WANTED TO BE
BURIED IN HER OWN CLOTHES,

25:21.600 --> 25:23.488
THEN ONE OF YOU BOYS
SHOULD GO TO HER HOME

25:23.500 --> 25:25.127
AND PICK SOMETHING OUT.

25:25.130 --> 25:26.620
ISN'T THAT
A BIT MUCH ?

25:26.630 --> 25:28.655
I REMEMBER DAD DOING IT
ONCE OR TWICE.

25:28.660 --> 25:30.548
YOU GET THE BUILDING MANAGER
TO LET YOU IN.

25:30.560 --> 25:33.324
FINE, I'LL PICK OUT
SOMETHING DRESSY.

25:33.330 --> 25:36.094
ACTUALLY, CONSIDERING
THE SHAPE HER BODY'S IN,

25:36.100 --> 25:38.159
I SHOULD PICK WHATEVER
COVERS HER UP THE MOST.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.821
I'LL COME WITH YOU.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.354
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.191
I KNOW THAT.

25:44.600 --> 25:47.057
AREN'T
THE GUYS SCARY ?

25:47.060 --> 25:48.596
IT MUST
GET DANGEROUS.

25:48.600 --> 25:50.818
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
IT DOESN'T.

25:50.830 --> 25:53.719
YOU JUST HAVE
TO TRUST YOUR INSTINCT.

25:53.730 --> 25:56.028
IT'S NEVER WRONG.

25:56.030 --> 25:59.022
WE'RE KIND OF LIKE
ANIMALS THAT WAY.

25:59.030 --> 26:01.225
WHEN I FIRST
MEET A CLIENT

26:01.230 --> 26:03.448
I TAKE A GOOD LONG LOOK
INTO HIS EYES.

26:03.460 --> 26:05.018
ALL THAT STUPID STUFF
THEY SAY

26:05.030 --> 26:06.952
ABOUT LOOKIN'
IN PEOPLE'S EYES IS TRUE.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.791
YOU JUST LOOK INTO THEM
AND YOU KNOW.

26:08.800 --> 26:09.949
KNOW WHAT ?

26:09.960 --> 26:13.157
WHETHER SOMEONE IS RIGHT
OR WHETHER THEY'RE,

26:13.160 --> 26:14.957
YOU KNOW...

26:14.960 --> 26:16.848
WRONG.

26:16.860 --> 26:18.691
AND IF THEY'RE WRONG,

26:18.700 --> 26:20.497
YOU JUST GET OUT OF THERE,
IMMEDIATELY.

26:22.630 --> 26:25.326
I THINK EVERYONE HAS THE ANSWERS
TO EVERYTHING IN LIFE,

26:25.330 --> 26:27.389
IT'S JUST A MATTER
OF KNOWING HOW TO LISTEN.

26:27.400 --> 26:28.492
YOU'RE FANTASTIC.

26:28.500 --> 26:29.398
FUCK YOU.

26:29.400 --> 26:30.492
YOU ARE !

26:30.500 --> 26:32.456
THERE IS NO BULLSHIT
WITH YOU.

26:32.460 --> 26:34.758
YOU ARE JUST
WHO YOU ARE, PERIOD.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.092
YOU KNOW, EVEN THE WAY
YOU TALK ABOUT YOUR WORK,

26:37.100 --> 26:39.022
YOU PROVIDE A SERVICE

26:39.030 --> 26:41.692
FOR WHICH YOU'RE
WELL COMPENSATED.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.656
UNLIKE THE REST
OF US LOSERS.

26:43.660 --> 26:45.196
PLEASE.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.293
IF THERE WERE ANYTHING ELSE
PEOPLE WOULD PAY ME
THIS MUCH MONEY FOR,

26:47.300 --> 26:49.291
I WOULD DO IT
IN A HEARTBEAT.

26:49.300 --> 26:51.495
BUT THERE'S NOT A TOUCH
OF VICTIMHOOD ABOUT YOU.

26:51.500 --> 26:54.253
IT'S ALMOST LIKE
IT'S EMPOWERING, IN A WAY.

26:54.260 --> 26:57.650
I WENT THROUGH THAT WHOLE
FEMINIST RATIONALIZATION STUFF
AT FIRST.

26:57.660 --> 26:59.855
NOW I'M JUST
A LITTLE MORE HONEST.

26:59.860 --> 27:02.954
IT'S JUST A WAY
TO PAY THE BILLS.

27:05.530 --> 27:08.021
SORRY, I CAN'T
MAKE IT TO THE FUNERAL,

27:08.030 --> 27:10.191
BUT MY KID'S
GOT A SOCCER GAME, SO...

27:10.200 --> 27:13.249
SHE WAS ONE OF YOUR TENANTS,
FOR GODSAKE.

27:13.260 --> 27:16.320
SHE LIVED
AMONG YOU.

27:16.330 --> 27:18.525
HEY, C'MON,
I JUST STARTED.

27:18.530 --> 27:21.090
SHE ONLY LIVED
AMONG ME FOR A WEEK.

27:21.100 --> 27:24.354
SHE NEVER EVEN GOT TO FINISH
HER CROSSWORD PUZZLE.

27:25.630 --> 27:29.225
ALRIGHT, LOOK,
FIVE MINUTES ?

27:29.230 --> 27:30.390
YEAH.

27:30.400 --> 27:31.355
GREAT.

27:34.130 --> 27:35.757
MOM ?

27:35.760 --> 27:40.094
EDDIE NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO ADAPT
TO HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

27:40.100 --> 27:42.056
I HAVE A LOT MORE
RESPONSIBILITY NOW.

27:42.060 --> 27:44.528
HE JUST NEEDS TO BE
MORE UNDERSTANDING

27:44.530 --> 27:46.498
THAT SOMETIMES
I'M GONNA BE TIRED, MAN.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.297
YEAH, KIDS COME FIRST,
PERIOD.

27:48.300 --> 27:49.722
YEAH, EXACTLY.

27:49.730 --> 27:52.096
HEY, HAVE YOU HAD
THIS CONVERSATION WITH HIM ?

27:52.100 --> 27:54.853
HE'D JUST SAY I NEED
TO MAKE MORE TIME FOR HIM,

27:54.860 --> 27:56.589
WHICH WOULD
PISS ME OFF.

27:56.600 --> 27:58.795
SO, WHY BOTHER TALKING
TO HIM ABOUT IT ?

27:58.800 --> 28:01.655
BECAUSE YOU KEEP
EVERYTHING BOTTLED UP
INSIDE YOU, MY FRIEND.

28:01.660 --> 28:03.855
THAT'S NOT GOOD,
THAT CREATES CANCER.

28:03.860 --> 28:04.792
GIVE ME A BREAK.

28:04.800 --> 28:05.892
HEY, IT DOES.

28:05.900 --> 28:07.652
MY WIFE'S COUSIN WAS
A VERY ANGRY PERSON,

28:07.660 --> 28:09.127
BUT SHE NEVER
SHOWED IT.

28:09.130 --> 28:12.349
SHE JUST CLEANED ALL DAY,
THEN SHE LOST BOTH HER BREASTS.

28:12.360 --> 28:13.827
IT'S WEIRD...

28:14.400 --> 28:16.527
YOU GET AWAY
FROM ME !

28:16.530 --> 28:18.794
DICKLESS FUCK,
YOU DON'T OWN ME, ALRIGHT ?!

28:18.800 --> 28:20.028
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU ?!

28:20.030 --> 28:21.622
YOU KNOW, YOU FUCKING
LIED TO ME, BITCH !

28:21.630 --> 28:24.428
I'LL BLOW YOUR FUCKING
BRAINS OUT, YOU STUPID CUNT !

28:24.430 --> 28:28.127
I WISH YOU WOULD, BUT YOU DON'T
GOT THE BALLS TO SHOOT ME !

28:28.130 --> 28:29.529
POLICE,
DROP THE GUN !

28:29.530 --> 28:31.293
STAY OUT OF THIS,
FUCKING COPS !

28:31.300 --> 28:33.029
HE SAID DROP THE GUN,
MISTER !

28:33.030 --> 28:34.588
YOU SHOOT ME,
THEY'RE GONNA SHOOT YOU.

28:34.600 --> 28:36.124
AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA BE DEAD,
YOU WORTHLESS PIECE OF SHIT,

28:36.130 --> 28:37.427
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ?

28:37.430 --> 28:38.397
THE WORLD WILL BE
A BETTER PLACE !

28:38.400 --> 28:39.298
SHUT UP !

28:39.300 --> 28:41.052
DROP THE GUN, NOW !

28:41.060 --> 28:41.799
( gunshot )

28:45.360 --> 28:48.693
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU,
WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR ?

28:48.700 --> 28:51.328
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU, HUH ?!

28:55.460 --> 29:00.124
I LIKE ALL OF THESE,
BUT THEY SEEM SO...

29:00.130 --> 29:01.324
FLAT.

29:01.330 --> 29:04.094
I WISH ONE HAD
A LITTLE MORE OOMPH.

29:04.100 --> 29:06.819
JUST GRAB THAT ONE,
THAT ONE HAS OOMPH.

29:06.830 --> 29:08.149
NO, IT DOESN'T.

29:08.160 --> 29:11.220
DON'T RUSH ME, NATE,
I'M NOT NEARLY DONE

29:11.230 --> 29:13.721
AND I HAVEN'T EVEN STARTED
WITH THE SHOES AND THE JEWELRY.

29:15.230 --> 29:17.949
( phone ringing )

29:17.960 --> 29:19.928
NATE FISHER.

29:21.300 --> 29:24.656
YEAH, HI, I LEFT A MESSAGE THERE
FOR FATHER MARTIN FARRELL ?

29:25.600 --> 29:28.455
HE WAS REQUESTED BY THE DECEASED
TO OFFICIATE AT HER FUNERAL.

29:28.460 --> 29:31.224
OH, GREAT.

29:33.060 --> 29:35.949
I'M SORRY, SISTER.

29:35.960 --> 29:39.259
WELL, ARE THERE ANY
OTHER PRIESTS YOU'D RECOMMEND...

30:22.700 --> 30:25.157
UH, MOM ?

30:28.300 --> 30:30.518
WHAT, ARE
YOU HUNGRY ?

30:30.530 --> 30:31.952
OF COURSE NOT.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.689
THEN, ARE YOU
READY TO GO ?

30:33.700 --> 30:34.997
I DON'T KNOW.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.753
MAYBE SHE LIKED
SOLITUDE.

30:37.760 --> 30:41.321
MAYBE SHE WAS LIVING THE LIFE
SHE WANTED AND WAS HAPPY.

30:41.330 --> 30:43.218
I HOPE SO.

30:43.230 --> 30:46.597
BUT WHAT IF SOME NIGHTS
SHE WANTED TO TALK TO SOMEONE

30:46.600 --> 30:48.727
AND SHE PICKED UP
THE TELEPHONE

30:48.730 --> 30:52.257
AND REALIZED SHE DIDN'T
HAVE ANYONE SHE COULD CALL,

30:52.260 --> 30:54.057
WHAT THEN ?

30:54.060 --> 30:56.722
WE DON'T KNOW THAT
SHE DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE TO CALL,

30:56.730 --> 30:58.459
MAYBE THERE WAS SOMEONE.

30:58.460 --> 31:00.018
I HOPE SO.

31:23.660 --> 31:25.992
( chattering )

31:31.460 --> 31:34.691
NO ONE THINKS
YOU DID ANYTHING WRONG.

31:34.700 --> 31:37.157
YOU WERE JUST
DOING YOUR JOB, OKAY ?

31:39.460 --> 31:43.021
WAIT, NOW I KNOW
WHAT'S DIFFERENT.

31:43.030 --> 31:44.827
YOU'RE NOT WEARING
YOUR GLASSES TONIGHT.

31:44.830 --> 31:46.354
OH.

31:46.360 --> 31:49.193
I WAS GETTING DRESSED
AND NOTHING LOOKED RIGHT,

31:49.200 --> 31:51.589
AND I REALIZED IT WAS
ALL MY GLASSES' FAULT.

31:51.600 --> 31:55.195
SO, I PUT IN THESE CONTACTS,
WHICH I ACTUALLY HATE.

31:55.200 --> 31:57.953
BUT I THOUGHT
IT WAS WORTH IT, IF YOU'D--

32:00.500 --> 32:04.288
THIS IS ME WITHOUT
BETA BLOCKERS.

32:04.300 --> 32:06.029
IT'S GOOD.

32:06.030 --> 32:08.248
MAYBE IT'S
EVEN BETTER.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.923
I...

32:14.900 --> 32:17.357
STILL WORK IN
THE FAMILY BUSINESS.

32:17.360 --> 32:18.998
EXCUSE ME ?

32:19.000 --> 32:21.889
I'M A FUNERAL DIRECTOR,
THAT'S WHO I AM.

32:21.900 --> 32:24.528
OH, WELL...

32:24.530 --> 32:27.624
I HAVE TO SAY I'M GLAD
YOU'RE NOT IN TEXTILES.

32:27.630 --> 32:29.495
THAT SOUNDED
REALLY DULL.

32:29.500 --> 32:32.424
BUT WHY DID
YOU LIE ?

32:32.430 --> 32:34.227
OH, C'MON.

32:34.230 --> 32:36.653
PEOPLE ALWAYS GET THAT
LOOK IN THEIR EYES,

32:36.660 --> 32:38.298
LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING
WRONG WITH YOU.

32:38.300 --> 32:40.325
AND THEY ONLY WAIT
ABOUT FIVE SECONDS BEFORE

32:40.330 --> 32:43.128
BRINGING THE CONVERSATION
AROUND TO NECROPHILIA.

32:43.130 --> 32:45.394
I JUST LIKED YOU
TOO MUCH.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.960
I WAS SCARED
IT WOULD REPULSE YOU.

32:47.960 --> 32:50.053
SO, WHAT MADE YOU
TELL ME NOW ?

32:50.060 --> 32:54.019
BECAUSE ON OUR LAST DATE
I JUST SORT OF LIKED YOU

32:54.030 --> 32:56.828
AND NOW I REALLY
LIKE YOU.

32:58.560 --> 33:01.996
SO, I DIDN'T SCREW THINGS UP
BECAUSE I LIED ?

33:02.000 --> 33:04.525
NO, I THINK IT'S CUTE.

33:05.730 --> 33:09.655
AND I'M GONNA WANNA
TAKE THIS SLOW.

33:09.660 --> 33:12.527
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT,
CAN WE JUST MAKE OUT ALREADY ?

33:23.360 --> 33:24.395
( knocking )

33:25.630 --> 33:27.518
CLAIRE !

33:27.530 --> 33:30.590
WE HAD PLANS
TO MEET TONIGHT.

33:30.600 --> 33:31.919
AT THE TIKI TI.

33:31.930 --> 33:33.227
DID WE ?

33:33.230 --> 33:35.698
CLAIRE, WHY DID YOU
BLOW ME OFF ?

33:35.700 --> 33:37.691
AND WHY DIDN'T YOU
RETURN MY PHONE CALLS ?

33:37.700 --> 33:40.555
BECAUSE I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY TO YOU.

33:40.560 --> 33:43.449
HEY, LOOK, I KNOW THIS
IS ABOUT THE S.A.T.'s.

33:43.460 --> 33:45.451
BUT IT
WASN'T MY FAULT.

33:45.460 --> 33:47.451
IT WAS
MY MOTHER'S IDEA.

33:47.460 --> 33:49.621
SHE HEARD ABOUT THIS GIRL
THROUGH ONE OF HER FRIENDS.

33:49.630 --> 33:51.325
SHE'S THIS GENIUS
FROM WESTLAKE

33:51.330 --> 33:52.820
WHO'S GOING AROUND
TAKING THE TEST

33:52.830 --> 33:54.627
AND LET ME TELL YOU,
IT WORKS.

33:58.030 --> 34:00.419
THIS IS SO GROSS.

34:00.430 --> 34:02.250
WHAT WAS I
SUPPOSED TO DO ?

34:04.430 --> 34:07.251
AND TOLD ME SHE'D ALREADY
PAID THE GIRL $1,000.

34:07.260 --> 34:09.490
YOU MAKE ME SO SICK,
JUST GET OUT OF HERE !

34:09.500 --> 34:13.095
OKAY, I DON'T FEEL LIKE
EVER SEEING YOU AGAIN.

34:14.530 --> 34:15.895
YOU'RE SERIOUS.

34:15.900 --> 34:17.026
YEAH, I AM.

34:18.800 --> 34:19.789
FINE.

34:19.800 --> 34:21.256
FUCK YOU, CLAIRE !

34:21.260 --> 34:24.093
AND BY THE WAY,
I FLIRTED FOR 45 MINUTES

34:24.100 --> 34:26.352
WITH GARY DEITMAN
OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL YESTERDAY.

34:26.360 --> 34:27.952
AND HE'S THIS TOTAL
HORNY LITTLE FREAK

34:27.960 --> 34:30.724
AND I'M GONNA BAG HIM,
BIG TIME.

34:30.730 --> 34:32.357
OH, CONGRATULATIONS.

34:32.360 --> 34:35.124
I HOPE YOU AND HIS STUPID BUNS
WILL BE VERY HAPPY TOGETHER.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.320
( door slamming )

34:38.560 --> 34:40.790
( David thinking )
DAVID FISHER AND BENJAMIN COOPER

34:40.800 --> 34:44.099
INVITE YOU TO
A HOLIDAY OPEN HOUSE.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.423
MERRY CHRISTMAS
FROM BEN AND DAVID.

34:48.500 --> 34:51.128
HAPPY HOLIDAYS
FROM THE COOPER-FISHERS.

34:51.130 --> 34:54.622
"FISH AND COOP",
NEW THIS FALL ON ABC.

34:56.300 --> 34:57.824
( knocking )

35:00.560 --> 35:03.199
KEITH,
WHAT'S WRONG ?

35:04.530 --> 35:06.828
I'M NOT SURE.

35:06.830 --> 35:08.695
OKAY.

35:08.700 --> 35:11.157
COME IN
AND SIT DOWN.

35:14.400 --> 35:17.528
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
EVEN COME HERE.

35:17.530 --> 35:19.293
IT'S FINE.

35:19.300 --> 35:21.450
YOU WANT A BEER ?

35:21.460 --> 35:23.519
I HAVE ROLLING ROCK
OR AMSTEL LIGHT--

35:23.530 --> 35:25.327
I KILLED
SOMEONE TODAY.

35:25.330 --> 35:26.752
OH, MY GOD.

35:26.760 --> 35:28.489
IT WAS THIS GUY...

35:30.030 --> 35:32.328
HIM AND THIS WOMAN
WERE HAVING A FIGHT.

35:32.330 --> 35:35.322
THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY
BOTH HIGH ON SOMETHING

35:35.330 --> 35:38.049
AND HE HAD
A GUN AND--

35:38.060 --> 35:40.893
I'M SURE WHATEVER IT WAS,
YOU DID THE RIGHT THING.

35:40.900 --> 35:43.425
HE'S DEAD,
YOU FUCKING IDIOT.

35:44.760 --> 35:48.218
I SHOULD'VE AIMED
AT HIS ARM OR HIS LEG.

35:49.530 --> 35:51.350
I'M STUPID.

35:51.360 --> 35:54.488
I'M SO FUCKING STUPID.

35:58.900 --> 36:00.856
I NEVER KILLED
SOMEONE BEFORE.

36:03.360 --> 36:05.590
I CAN'T LIVE
WITH THIS.

36:07.130 --> 36:08.927
I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO HELP YOU.

36:08.930 --> 36:10.625
DO YOU...

36:10.630 --> 36:12.689
DO YOU WANT
TO PRAY ?

36:12.700 --> 36:15.260
MAYBE THAT WOULD
DO SOMETHING.

36:41.030 --> 36:43.555
DAVID'S
NOT UP YET ?

36:45.200 --> 36:46.656
SO, WHERE'S
EMILY PREVIN ?

36:46.660 --> 36:49.094
SHE'S, UH...

36:49.100 --> 36:51.250
SHE'S IN THERE.

36:52.760 --> 36:56.355
OH, SO, SHE'S NOT GONNA
HAVE AN OPEN CASKET.

36:57.660 --> 36:59.799
I COULDN'T DO IT.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.256
OKAY.

37:01.260 --> 37:03.728
I WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE
THE KIDS TO DINNER LAST NIGHT

37:03.730 --> 37:05.459
SO VANESSA COULD
HAVE THE NIGHT OFF,

37:05.460 --> 37:09.226
BUT INSTEAD I WAS HERE
UNTIL 9:00 LAST NIGHT.

37:09.230 --> 37:13.394
BUT THE SKIN WAS FRIGGIN'
POURING OFF THAT WOMAN'S FACE !

37:13.400 --> 37:15.197
SO, I GET ALL
THIS SHIT FROM VANESSA

37:15.200 --> 37:17.418
AND I WASN'T EVEN ABLE TO
RESTORE THE FUCKING POOR LADY.

37:17.430 --> 37:18.522
NOBODY COULD HAVE.

37:18.530 --> 37:19.622
RICO...

37:19.630 --> 37:21.359
BUT HERE, YOU THINK
YOU CAN DO IT ?

37:21.360 --> 37:23.954
HERE'S SOME TOOLS.

37:23.960 --> 37:26.554
I WANT TO WATCH YOU
SWIM IN THAT SKIN, GO AHEAD !

37:26.560 --> 37:28.619
HEY, ALL I SAID
WAS OKAY.

37:36.730 --> 37:38.527
I'M SORRY.

37:40.100 --> 37:43.126
I JUST WISH I COULD'VE DONE HER
THE WAY SHE WANTED.

37:43.130 --> 37:45.758
LOOK, IF IT'LL MAKE YOU
FEEL ANY BETTER,

37:45.760 --> 37:48.024
I DON'T THINK THERE ARE
EVEN GONNA BE ANY MOURNERS.

37:51.530 --> 37:52.497
THAN KS.

37:54.030 --> 37:56.294
( phone ringing )

37:59.360 --> 38:01.248
( phone )
KEITH ?

38:03.900 --> 38:05.720
HELLO ?

38:05.730 --> 38:07.789
HEY, IT'S ME.

38:07.800 --> 38:10.496
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
STILL HERE.

38:10.500 --> 38:12.525
I had to
get back home.

38:12.530 --> 38:16.022
OH, ARE YOU OKAY ?

38:16.030 --> 38:17.952
YEAH, I'M FINE.

38:17.960 --> 38:19.996
LISTEN,
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT,

38:20.000 --> 38:21.490
THAT WAS WRONG.

38:21.500 --> 38:24.321
I don't know
why I went to you,

38:24.330 --> 38:26.753
but obviously
I wasn't thinking right.

38:27.830 --> 38:29.092
OBVIOUSLY.

38:29.100 --> 38:30.988
I'M IN A RELATIONSHIP.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.298
I KNOW THAT,
I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

38:33.300 --> 38:35.552
I JUST THOUGHT YOU AND I
COULD BE FRIENDS,

38:35.560 --> 38:39.428
BUT I WAS JUST
KIDDING MYSELF.

38:39.430 --> 38:43.628
Look, I don't think
that you and I

38:43.630 --> 38:46.098
should see
each other anymore.

38:50.860 --> 38:52.157
DAVID ?

38:52.160 --> 38:56.153
YEAH, I'M HERE,
SURE, WHATEVER YOU WANT.

38:56.160 --> 38:59.220
I KNEW YOU
WOULD UNDERSTAND.

38:59.230 --> 39:03.257
( door slamming )
WELL, GOODBYE.

39:03.260 --> 39:05.490
BYE.

39:13.830 --> 39:15.525
THANK YOU.

39:15.530 --> 39:17.418
THAT WAS INTENSE.

39:17.430 --> 39:20.024
YOU'RE PRACTICALLY LIKE JELLY,
YOU REALLY DON'T NEED THIS.

39:20.030 --> 39:22.351
MAYBE NOT,
BUT I LOVE IT.

39:22.360 --> 39:24.794
YOU'RE GIFTED,
YOU KNOW THAT.

39:24.800 --> 39:26.927
( phone ringing )

39:26.930 --> 39:28.659
HELLO ?

39:30.000 --> 39:32.491
DON'T GIVE ME THAT
BULLSHIT, ALLISON.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.593
I WANT YOUR ASS THERE
IN HALF AN HOUR.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.124
OKAY, FUCK YOU.

39:36.130 --> 39:38.121
YOU ARE OFFICIALLY
DEAD TO ME NOW.

39:40.360 --> 39:41.998
EVERYTHING OKAY ?

39:42.000 --> 39:45.151
I HAVE A CLIENT AT 2:15
AND MY WATCHER JUST CANCELED.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.627
YOUR WATCHER ?

39:46.630 --> 39:49.656
YEAH, HE LIKES TO BE WATCHED
BY ANOTHER GIRL WHILE I DO HIM.

39:49.660 --> 39:51.548
IT'S LIKE THE EASIEST
HUNDRED BUCKS IN THE WORLD,

39:51.560 --> 39:55.348
BUT THIS ASSHOLE
JUST BLEW ME OFF
FOR A RUNWAY AUDITION.

39:55.360 --> 39:58.056
GOD, I HATE MODELS.

39:59.630 --> 40:00.790
FUCK...

40:00.800 --> 40:01.994
HEY, PAULA.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.491
IF YOU'RE SITTING IN THE CORNER
DEPRESSED, PICK UP.

40:05.660 --> 40:07.389
PICK UP.

40:07.400 --> 40:10.221
ALRIGHT,
BE DEPRESSED.

40:10.230 --> 40:11.857
( hanging up phone )

40:13.100 --> 40:16.228
HEY, LISTEN,
IF YOU'RE IN A JAM...

40:16.230 --> 40:19.393
THIS ISN'T A SCIENCE PROJECT,
HONEY, THIS IS BUSINESS.

40:19.400 --> 40:21.652
OH PLEASE, YOU THINK
I CAN'T HANDLE IT ?

40:26.760 --> 40:29.251
WELL, LIKE I SAID,
IT'S PRETTY EASY.

40:30.160 --> 40:32.958
ACTUALLY, IT'S LIKE
YOU'RE INVISIBLE.

40:32.960 --> 40:34.951
JUST SITTING
AND WATCHING.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.222
I CAN DO THAT.

40:36.230 --> 40:37.822
I SIT AND WATCH
ALL THE TIME.

40:37.830 --> 40:39.457
IN FACT,
THAT'S MOSTLY ALL I DO.

40:39.460 --> 40:41.553
AND I GUESS YOU'VE BEEN
IN THREE-WAY SITUATIONS BEFORE.

40:41.560 --> 40:43.528
I MEAN,
WHO HASN'T ?

40:46.430 --> 40:47.556
FUCK.

40:50.600 --> 40:52.955
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
THIS ANGRY BEFORE.

40:52.960 --> 40:54.097
I THINK
IT'S TERRIFIC.

40:54.100 --> 40:55.590
MY NEPHEW MADE THAT.

40:55.600 --> 40:56.794
OH, SORRY.

40:56.800 --> 40:58.119
TALK TO ME.

40:58.130 --> 41:00.348
THIS GIRL CHEATED
ON THE S.A.T.'S

41:00.360 --> 41:01.952
AND NOW SHE'S GONNA
GET AWAY WITH IT.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.326
OKAY, WHAT'S THIS
GIRL'S NAME ?

41:05.500 --> 41:07.855
WHEN I REALIZED
WHAT WAS GOING ON,

41:07.860 --> 41:09.657
I JUST WANTED TO RUN
AND NOT TAKE THE TEST.

41:09.660 --> 41:11.753
BUT I DID, I TOOK IT
LIKE AN IDIOT

41:11.760 --> 41:12.954
AND WHAT
WAS THE POINT ?

41:12.960 --> 41:14.951
THIS IS ALL
SOME STUPID GAME.

41:14.960 --> 41:17.758
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT,
BUT I KNOW I DON'T WANT THIS.

41:17.760 --> 41:20.126
SO, YOU'RE GONNA USE THIS
AS AN EXCUSE TO BAIL ?

41:20.130 --> 41:22.394
BAIL, WHAT IS THAT
SOME HIP LINGO YOU THINK
THE KIDS ARE SAYING ?

41:22.400 --> 41:24.425
YOU ARE SO
FUCKING LAME SOMETIMES.

41:24.430 --> 41:26.728
IT'S FINE FOR YOU TO
DIRECT YOUR ANGER AT ME
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

41:26.730 --> 41:28.994
BY THE WAY, YOU CAN FUCK
PARKER MCKENNA IF YOU WANT TO,
I DON'T CARE.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.695
BUT IF I WERE YOU
I WOULD WEAR A CONDOM,

41:30.700 --> 41:33.294
BECAUSE I'M SURE THAT GIRL
HAS A MAJOR CASE OF HEPATITIS
AT THE VERY LEAST !

41:33.300 --> 41:35.621
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

41:35.630 --> 41:37.325
LOOK, IF YOU'RE
REFERRING TO THE FACT

41:37.330 --> 41:39.355
THAT I HAD A CONVERSATION
WITH PARKER YESTERDAY,

41:39.360 --> 41:41.351
THAT'S ALL IT WAS,
A CONVERSATION.

41:41.360 --> 41:43.499
I HAVE CONVERSATIONS
WITH LOTS OF YOUNG WOMEN.

41:43.500 --> 41:44.853
THEY APPROACH ME.

41:44.860 --> 41:46.225
UGH.

41:46.230 --> 41:48.551
CLAIRE,
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

41:49.630 --> 41:51.655
WHY ?

41:51.660 --> 41:53.651
BECAUSE I SEE YOU GETTING
YOUR LIFE TOGETHER
AND IT SCARES YOU.

41:53.660 --> 41:55.525
SO YOU WANT TO SLIP INTO
THE OLD FAMILIAR HABIT

41:55.530 --> 41:57.589
OF FOCUSING ON
SOMEONE ELSE'S DRAMA

41:57.600 --> 41:59.522
INSTEAD OF CONCENTRATING
ON YOURSELF.

41:59.530 --> 42:01.452
YOU NEED TO STOP
DOING THAT.

42:06.400 --> 42:07.594
YOU'RE RIGHT.

42:11.830 --> 42:15.493
AND NOW IS PROBABLY
AS GOOD A TIME AS ANY

42:15.500 --> 42:18.389
FOR US TO TALK ABOUT
THE SEXUAL TENSION BETWEEN US.

42:18.400 --> 42:20.129
WHAT ?!

42:20.130 --> 42:22.121
IT EXISTS.

42:22.130 --> 42:24.519
IT'S A NORMAL PART
OF TRANSFERENCE
AND COUNTER-TRANSFERENCE.

42:24.530 --> 42:26.657
SO, WE SHOULD BOTH ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT IT'S OUT THERE

42:26.660 --> 42:28.321
AND IT WILL
NEVER BE ACTED UPON,

42:28.330 --> 42:31.458
BECAUSE TO DO SO WOULD BE
IRRESPONSIBLE AND DESTRUCT IVE.

42:36.400 --> 42:39.790
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING THAT
YOU WOULD LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE ?

42:39.800 --> 42:43.622
NO, I DON'T !

42:44.830 --> 42:46.058
OKAY.

42:47.360 --> 42:49.419
SO...

42:49.430 --> 42:54.857
I BET YOU I COULD GLUE
THIS TOGETHER IF I TRIED HARD.

42:54.860 --> 42:58.557
I KNOW PEOPLE DON'T REALLY
GLUE THINGS TOGETHER ANYMORE.

42:58.560 --> 43:00.755
BUT I COULD
PROBABLY FIX THIS.

43:05.660 --> 43:08.891
( phone ringing )

43:08.900 --> 43:10.253
OH...

43:11.130 --> 43:14.099
( answering machine )
You've reached the private line
of David Fisher.

43:14.100 --> 43:15.897
Please leave a message
after the beep.

43:15.900 --> 43:17.094
( beeping )

43:17.100 --> 43:18.692
( male )
Hi, David, it's Ben.

43:18.700 --> 43:20.497
I'm just calling
to figure out

43:20.500 --> 43:22.354
what time's good
for you on Saturday.

43:22.360 --> 43:24.396
Oh, and I had a really
good time last night,

43:24.400 --> 43:26.493
especially
the making out part.

43:26.500 --> 43:28.559
Okay, um...

43:28.560 --> 43:30.255
Bye.

43:30.260 --> 43:31.818
( hanging up )

43:38.130 --> 43:40.018
( male )
OH YEAH, HONEY.

43:40.030 --> 43:44.251
YOU KNOW EXACTLY
HOW I LIKE IT.

43:44.260 --> 43:47.696
C'MON, MOVE YOUR
TONGUE AROUND IT.

43:53.760 --> 43:55.318
YEAH.

44:19.530 --> 44:25.127
( playing "I am telling you,
I'm not going" )

44:38.730 --> 44:44.726
AND I AM TELLING YOU
I'M NOT GOING

44:44.730 --> 44:48.951
I'M THE BEST MAN
YOU'LL EVER KNOW

44:48.960 --> 44:52.748
THERE'S NO WAY
I COULD EVER GO

44:52.760 --> 44:56.059
( female )
I'LL DO ANYTHING, NATE,
I LOVE YOU !

45:07.230 --> 45:10.529
NOW, THAT I'VE HEARD
THIS CRAPPY SONG
FIVE TIMES IN A ROW,

45:10.530 --> 45:12.657
I CAN HONESTLY SAY
I DON'T LIKE IT.

45:12.660 --> 45:14.457
I'M HERE
FOR THE SERVICE.

45:15.530 --> 45:17.828
MOM, LOOK AROUND,
THERE'S NOBODY HERE.

45:17.830 --> 45:19.354
THERE'S NOT GONNA
BE ANY SERVICE.

45:19.360 --> 45:21.658
I COULDN'T EVEN GET A MINISTER
TO COME AND THOSE GUYS GET PAID.

45:21.660 --> 45:22.888
I'VE TAKEN
CARE OF THAT.

45:22.900 --> 45:25.050
FATHER JACK IS ON
HIS WAY HERE RIGHT NOW.

45:25.060 --> 45:27.028
JUST GIVE ME
10 MINUTES.

45:27.030 --> 45:28.292
FOR WHAT ?

45:31.400 --> 45:33.391
FEDERICO.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.254
YES, MRS. F. ?

45:35.260 --> 45:37.899
COULD YOU COME UPSTAIRS,
PLEASE ?

45:41.530 --> 45:43.452
( door slamming )

45:43.460 --> 45:44.757
KEITH ?

45:47.560 --> 45:48.857
OH.

45:48.860 --> 45:51.192
DAVID, I NEED YOU
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

45:51.200 --> 45:53.020
MOM, I HAVE A HEADACHE.

45:53.030 --> 45:54.395
TOO BAD.

45:56.630 --> 45:58.791
BUT I'M IN THE MIDDLE
OF A SHOW.

45:58.800 --> 46:00.256
JUST DO
WHAT I SAY !

46:00.260 --> 46:02.296
AND GET OUT OF THOSE
RAGAMUFFIN CLOTHES.

46:08.130 --> 46:10.826
WHY IS THIS
HAPPENING ?

46:10.830 --> 46:14.391
I DON'T KNOW, OUR STRUCTURES
PROBABLY NEED NEW FENCING.

46:14.400 --> 46:17.028
OR OUR ROOFS
HAVE BAD SHINGLES.

46:17.030 --> 46:19.021
I HAD
SHINGLES ONCE.

46:21.860 --> 46:24.556
SHE WAS SUPPOSED
TO HAVE AN OPEN CASKET.

46:25.960 --> 46:28.758
I DID THE BEST
I COULD, OKAY ?

46:28.760 --> 46:31.092
I DIDN'T SEE YOU
DOWN THERE HELPING ME OUT !

46:32.900 --> 46:35.095
LEAVE IT ALONE.

46:40.200 --> 46:44.250
WE GATHER TO MOURN
THE PASSING OF EMILY PREVIN.

46:44.260 --> 46:47.093
I DID NOT KNOW
EMILY PREVIN.

46:47.100 --> 46:49.921
FROM WHAT I GATHER,
FEW, IF ANY PEOPLE DID.

46:49.930 --> 46:53.354
PEOPLE MIGHT WONDER
WHAT POINT THERE IS

46:53.360 --> 46:54.850
IN LEADING A LIFE,

46:54.860 --> 46:57.397
WHERE YOU DON'T TOUCH
ANY OTHER LIVES.

46:57.400 --> 47:00.824
BUT IT WOULD BE ARROGANT
OF US TO ASSUME THAT.

47:00.830 --> 47:04.220
EVERY LIFE
IS A CONTRIBUTION,

47:04.230 --> 47:06.619
WE JUST MAY NOT
SEE HOW.

47:06.630 --> 47:09.690
I AM GLAD TO
ENCOUNTER EMILY PREVIN,

47:09.700 --> 47:12.021
EVEN IF
IT IS IN DEATH.

47:12.030 --> 47:15.022
EVERYONE COMES INTO
OUR LIFE FOR A REASON

47:15.030 --> 47:17.897
AND IT IS OUR
RESPONSIBILITY TO LEARN

47:17.900 --> 47:19.754
WHAT THEY HAVE
TO TEACH US.

47:23.300 --> 47:25.951
NOW, IN ACCORDANCE
WITH EMILY'S WISHES,

47:25.960 --> 47:28.793
I WILL READ FROM THE BOOK
OF MATTHEW, CHAPTER 11.

47:28.800 --> 47:31.758
IT'S STRANGE, BUT SOMEHOW
I FEEL LIKE EMILY WON.

47:31.760 --> 47:33.751
SHE REMAINS
A FUCKING QUESTION MARK

47:33.760 --> 47:35.694
RIGHT UP TO
THE BITTER END.

47:35.700 --> 47:37.258
BASICALLY,
ALL I KNOW ABOUT HER

47:37.260 --> 47:39.524
IS THAT SHE KEPT WHEAT THINS
IN HER REFRIGERATOR.

47:41.460 --> 47:43.621
WELL, THAT'S SOMETHING.

47:43.630 --> 47:45.689
SO, TELL YOUR MOTHER
I HAVE TO GET BACK TO WORK.

47:45.700 --> 47:47.622
UNLIKE SOME PEOPLE.

47:47.630 --> 47:51.122
I'M SORRY, FEDERICO,
BUT I HAVE A HEADACHE.

47:51.130 --> 47:52.893
AM I NOT ALLOWED
TO HAVE A HEADACHE ?

47:54.960 --> 47:55.995
DAVID ?

47:56.000 --> 47:58.628
IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

47:58.630 --> 47:59.824
HELLO, FATHER.

48:01.060 --> 48:04.029
HOW IS EVERYTHING
AT ST. STEPHEN'S ?

48:04.030 --> 48:06.521
IT'S...

48:06.530 --> 48:07.827
OKAY.

48:07.830 --> 48:11.948
APROPOS OF
WHAT I SAID EARLIER,

48:11.960 --> 48:14.099
I WANTED
TO THANK YOU, DAVID.

48:14.100 --> 48:17.251
I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU CAME INTO MY LIFE.

48:17.260 --> 48:20.149
YOU WILL NEVER KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU TAUGHT ME ABOUT MYSELF.

48:20.160 --> 48:23.220
REALLY, HOW SO ?

48:23.230 --> 48:26.154
ANOTHER TIME MAYBE.

48:26.160 --> 48:28.321
YOU LOOK
A LITTLE SAD.

48:28.330 --> 48:29.991
I HAVE A HEADACHE.

48:31.960 --> 48:33.598
WELL, GOD BLESS.

48:36.700 --> 48:38.725
DAVID,
COME OVER HERE.

48:38.730 --> 48:41.290
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANT
TO SAY TO THE THREE OF YOU.

48:41.300 --> 48:43.222
OH LORD, OUR GUTTERS
ARE CLOGGED.

48:43.230 --> 48:45.551
I THINK WE NEED TO SEE
ABOUT REMOVING THE LEAVES.

48:45.560 --> 48:47.198
THAT'S VERY FUNNY,
CLAIRE.

48:47.200 --> 48:50.021
I KNOW YOU THREE THINK
"THE PLAN" IS RIDICULOUS.

48:50.030 --> 48:51.190
NO, WE DON'T.

48:51.200 --> 48:52.997
WE JUST THINK
IT'S WEIRD.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.150
DID ANY ONE OF YOU WONDER
WHY I FELT THE NEED

48:55.160 --> 48:57.594
TO CHANGE THE STRUCTURE
OF MY LIFE ?

48:57.600 --> 48:58.851
DID YOU EVEN CARE ?

49:00.400 --> 49:02.550
AT FIRST
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

49:02.560 --> 49:04.448
WHY I WAS SO UPSET
ABOUT EMILY PREVIN,

49:04.460 --> 49:06.155
AND THEN IT HIT ME.

49:06.160 --> 49:08.219
I DON'T WANT TO
TURN INTO HER.

49:08.230 --> 49:10.494
LIFE IS HARD ENOUGH
WITHOUT NOT HAVING PEOPLE

49:10.500 --> 49:11.956
TO HELP YOU
THROUGH IT.

49:11.960 --> 49:13.222
MOM, YOU HAVE US.

49:13.230 --> 49:14.527
IDO NOT!

49:14.530 --> 49:17.294
NATE, YOU'VE BEEN WALKING AROUND
LIKE A ZOMBIE FOR MONTHS.

49:17.300 --> 49:20.497
DAVID, YOU'RE LYING IN BED
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY

49:20.500 --> 49:21.751
GOD KNOWS WHY.

49:21.760 --> 49:23.091
I HAVE A HEADACHE.

49:23.100 --> 49:24.954
CLAIRE, I CAN'T EVEN
LOOK IN YOUR DIRECTION

49:24.960 --> 49:28.054
WITHOUT YOU ACTING LIKE
IT'S SOME INCREDIBLE IMPOSITION.

49:28.060 --> 49:30.927
ALL I WANT IS FOR US
NOT TO BE STRANGERS.

49:32.930 --> 49:35.899
GIVE ME INTIMACY.

49:35.900 --> 49:39.927
WON'T ANY OF YOU
HAVE INTIMACY WITH ME ?

49:43.630 --> 49:48.055
OKAY, I GUESS
I HAVE MY ANSWER.

49:48.060 --> 49:50.528
MOM, WAIT,
I JUST THINK THAT

49:50.530 --> 49:53.192
INTIMACY SHOULD HAPPEN A LITTLE
MORE ORGANICALLY THAN THIS.

49:53.200 --> 49:54.997
FINE.

49:55.000 --> 49:57.560
THEN I'LL SIMPLY WAIT FOR IT,
LIKE I HAVE BEEN.

49:57.560 --> 50:00.154
I JUST PRAY
THAT IT HAPPENS

50:00.160 --> 50:02.219
BEFORE I END UP
LIKE EMILY PREVIN.

50:02.230 --> 50:05.449
NOW, IF YOU'LL
PLEASE EXCUSE ME.

50:13.960 --> 50:16.497
WHEN I SAW YOU TYPING
AT YOUR COMPUTER TONIGHT,

50:16.500 --> 50:19.025
YOU HAD THE STRANGEST
EXPRESSION ON YOUR FACE.

50:19.030 --> 50:20.520
I WAS WRITING.

50:20.530 --> 50:22.088
IT'S CALLED "FLOW".

50:22.100 --> 50:24.955
YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT "FLOW",
DON'T YOU ?

50:27.560 --> 50:29.596
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION.

50:29.600 --> 50:33.354
DO YOU THINK YOU AND I HAVE
AS MUCH INTIMACY AS YOU WANT ?

50:37.060 --> 50:40.120
I DON'T HAVE AS MUCH
OF ANYTHING AS I WANT.

50:40.130 --> 50:43.622
THAT'S NOT REALLY
MUCH OF AN ANSWER.

50:43.630 --> 50:46.793
WELL, IT WASN'T REALLY
MUCH OF A QUESTION.

50:49.230 --> 50:51.425
DID YOU REMEMBER
TO LOCK THE DOOR ?

50:51.430 --> 50:53.523
YES, I DID,
FOR THE SECOND TIME.

50:55.400 --> 50:56.594
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

50:56.600 --> 50:58.750
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN
ALL JUMPY.

51:07.260 --> 51:09.057
OH, GOD.

51:09.060 --> 51:12.655
OKAY, SOMETHING
HAS BEEN ON MY MIND.

51:27.530 --> 51:30.328
NATE FISHER...

51:32.560 --> 51:34.892
WOULD YOU
BE MY WIFE ?

51:37.060 --> 51:39.597
OH, MY GOD, THIS ISN'T
WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.

51:39.600 --> 51:41.625
IS THAT A "NO" ?

51:41.630 --> 51:43.427
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

51:44.730 --> 51:47.426
IT IS KIND OF
AN UGLY RING.

51:47.430 --> 51:49.557
IT'S GOT THESE
GREEK LETTERS ON IT.

51:49.560 --> 51:51.926
DELTA PHI DELTA,

51:51.930 --> 51:54.091
IT'S MY GRANDFATHER'S
FRATERNITY RING.

51:54.100 --> 51:55.852
I FOUND IT WHEN
I WAS CLEANING UP

51:55.860 --> 51:58.795
AND THAT'S WHEN
I GOT THE IDEA

51:58.800 --> 52:02.918
TO PROPOSE TO YOU.

52:06.700 --> 52:08.691
SO, WHY TODAY ?

52:08.700 --> 52:11.123
I...

52:12.600 --> 52:15.125
I JUST STARTED THINKING...

52:16.860 --> 52:19.658
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO
IF I EVER LOST YOU.

52:21.860 --> 52:24.499
WELL, I'M NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

52:24.500 --> 52:26.991
PROMISE ?

52:38.900 --> 52:41.118
OF COURSE I'LL MARRY YOU,
I LOVE YOU.

52:41.130 --> 52:42.654
ABSOLUTELY !

52:42.660 --> 52:43.922
I LOVE YOU.

52:43.930 --> 52:46.490
YEAH, LET'S GET MARRIED,
YES, YES, YES !

52:46.500 --> 52:48.923
LET'S GET MARRIED, C'MON.

52:51.260 --> 52:53.592
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

52:59.030 --> 53:00.725
( whistling )

53:55.700 --> 53:57.520
( sobbing )
