00:03.444 --> 00:06.475
I'm Dr. Jason Bull.
I'm not a lawyer.

00:06.500 --> 00:10.119
I'm an expert in what's
called trial science.

00:10.120 --> 00:13.959
I study the jury's behavioral patterns.

00:13.960 --> 00:16.713
I know what they're
thinking before they do.

00:17.540 --> 00:19.669
Everything my team learns

00:19.670 --> 00:21.539
gets plugged into a matrix,

00:21.540 --> 00:24.289
which allows us to
assemble a mirror jury

00:24.290 --> 00:27.253
that is scary in its
predictive efficiency.

00:29.710 --> 00:32.579
The verdict you get depends on me.

00:32.580 --> 00:34.579
And that's no bull.

00:50.436 --> 00:52.354
Are you crazy?

00:52.355 --> 00:54.998
Do you want him to be made fun
of for the rest of his life?

00:55.023 --> 00:56.655
- This is your son!
- Karen!

00:58.315 --> 00:59.404
Excuse me.

00:59.405 --> 01:01.090
I don't want to talk about this.

01:01.115 --> 01:03.234
This is the 30th time
we've talked about this.

01:05.858 --> 01:07.735
- John... Stop.
- I'm defending my son.

01:07.738 --> 01:09.314
Stop what?

01:09.315 --> 01:11.314
Listen to me, this is your son!

01:14.485 --> 01:16.905
Did you see the way
that guy's treating him?

01:21.485 --> 01:23.154
Karen.

01:23.155 --> 01:24.564
Karen!

01:24.565 --> 01:26.985
God. Karen!

01:27.924 --> 01:28.924
Karen!

01:34.235 --> 01:36.404
God, my wife!

01:36.405 --> 01:38.563
My wife, she needs help!

01:39.565 --> 01:41.194
My God.

01:41.195 --> 01:43.614
My God. Call 911.

01:43.615 --> 01:45.484
Call 911.

01:45.485 --> 01:47.775
Call 911!

01:50.224 --> 01:52.654
The prosecution
has attempted to throw roadblocks

01:52.655 --> 01:53.614
in front of my client

01:53.615 --> 01:55.654
at every turn, in an
outrageous attempt...

01:55.655 --> 01:57.114
Judge Lamkin.

01:57.115 --> 01:59.524
Can almost make civil court tolerable.

01:59.525 --> 02:02.450
That's three days in a row
her eyes fluttered at 3:30,

02:02.475 --> 02:04.904
only to perk up again
after her 4:00 p.m. tea.

02:04.905 --> 02:07.216
You don't know that's tea.

02:07.241 --> 02:10.564
Either way, we need to see our
best witnesses in the morning.

02:10.565 --> 02:12.654
And it's tea.

02:12.655 --> 02:14.614
Lamkin only has one drink a day,

02:14.615 --> 02:16.821
after dinner, single-malt scotch.

02:16.846 --> 02:18.961
And you know that how, exactly?

02:20.236 --> 02:21.285
Never mind.

02:21.310 --> 02:22.654
The prosecution's witness

02:22.655 --> 02:24.444
had a change in schedule.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.154
We will resume Wednesday.

02:26.155 --> 02:28.404
Your Honor, the prosecution knew

02:28.405 --> 02:30.274
the officer's patrol shifted.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.904
This means four more days in jail.

02:31.905 --> 02:34.564
Mr. Foster, you've made
this argument three times,

02:34.565 --> 02:35.595
three different ways now.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.064
Wednesday stands.

02:37.065 --> 02:38.614
It's just a shame the way they throw

02:38.615 --> 02:40.444
these public defenders to the wolves.

02:40.445 --> 02:41.615
Mr. Public Defender...

02:43.025 --> 02:45.114
In this county, lawyers sit on the right.

02:45.115 --> 02:46.115
Watch it, Bull.

02:46.833 --> 02:47.833
Sorry, Your Honor.

02:56.115 --> 02:58.064
Dr. Bull.

02:58.065 --> 03:00.904
I'm gonna go get the car.

03:00.905 --> 03:02.484
Judge Lamkin, always a pleasure.

03:02.485 --> 03:06.484
And that is a new robe... Rag & Bone?

03:06.485 --> 03:09.024
How would you like to do me a favor?

03:09.025 --> 03:11.354
A case in Judge Bergen's court.

03:11.355 --> 03:13.484
I was hoping it would be
a little more interesting,

03:13.485 --> 03:14.654
but go on.

03:14.655 --> 03:17.826
Some poor guy was in a car
accident, and his wife was killed.

03:17.851 --> 03:20.459
The DA's going after him
for vehicular manslaughter.

03:20.484 --> 03:22.655
- And you'd throw out the case.
- I would.

03:22.658 --> 03:23.774
Bergen's not so forgiving.

03:23.775 --> 03:25.444
I thought you and your team could

03:25.445 --> 03:27.724
jump on board,
at least make it a fair fight.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.154
Well, Judge, you know
my plate is very full.

03:30.155 --> 03:31.748
I have a trial coming up in your court.

03:31.773 --> 03:33.759
I could always postpone it.

03:33.760 --> 03:35.179
And suddenly my plate is empty.

03:36.390 --> 03:37.265
Do we have a lawyer?

03:37.266 --> 03:38.139
Can't afford one.

03:38.140 --> 03:40.929
So it's whoever draws the
long straw at Legal Aid.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.856
What about that guy?

03:45.278 --> 03:46.929
I think he was sworn in at the bar

03:46.930 --> 03:48.089
on his way to court this morning.

03:48.090 --> 03:50.639
Perfect.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.299
I love a fresh lump of clay.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.969
And what, you're Michelangelo?

03:53.970 --> 03:56.799
Michelangelo's David

03:56.800 --> 03:59.089
was chiseled from a very large,

03:59.090 --> 04:00.929
imperfect block of marble

04:00.930 --> 04:02.799
other artisans wouldn't touch.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.089
I look forward to your masterpiece.

04:11.220 --> 04:13.429
John and Karen Phillips.

04:13.430 --> 04:17.928
Married ten years, one son, Carter.

04:17.930 --> 04:20.349
Luckily, Carter was not in the
car at the time of the crash.

04:20.350 --> 04:22.429
God. How fast was he going?

04:22.430 --> 04:23.969
11 miles an hour over the speed limit.

04:23.970 --> 04:25.429
That doesn't sound reckless.

04:25.430 --> 04:26.429
Well, I never speed.

04:26.430 --> 04:28.759
It's called taking the subway.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.609
The police report says there was a sign

04:30.634 --> 04:32.775
warning cars to slow down,
and he'd had a drink

04:32.800 --> 04:34.219
at a barbecue beforehand.

04:34.220 --> 04:35.542
Blood alcohol?

04:35.567 --> 04:37.927
.04... one beer.

04:37.952 --> 04:39.349
Below the legal limit.

04:39.350 --> 04:41.349
To prosecute
for vehicular manslaughter,

04:41.350 --> 04:43.469
they'd have to prove
that John purposely drove

04:43.470 --> 04:45.469
in an agitated state.

04:45.470 --> 04:46.929
I don't get it.

04:46.930 --> 04:48.469
What's their case?

04:48.470 --> 04:50.259
Exactly. How often

04:50.260 --> 04:51.759
does the DA push for manslaughter

04:51.760 --> 04:53.009
on a traffic accident?

04:53.010 --> 04:55.009
Less than five percent of the time.

04:55.010 --> 04:56.759
This is the question.

04:56.760 --> 04:59.469
What is motivating the DA to prosecute?

04:59.470 --> 05:01.349
I'm on it.

05:01.350 --> 05:02.567
I'm tempted to hack

05:02.592 --> 05:05.349
into the DA's private server and
then... just give me an hour

05:05.350 --> 05:07.299
and an iced quad espresso

05:07.300 --> 05:09.429
and I'll have something, okay?

05:09.430 --> 05:12.349
I never know whether to
be scared or impressed.

05:12.350 --> 05:14.219
First instinct's usually the best.

05:14.220 --> 05:19.049
Baseball dad, devoted husband.

05:19.050 --> 05:21.589
Worked double shifts
as an HVAC installer,

05:21.590 --> 05:24.589
just to take his family to
Coney Island once a year.

05:24.590 --> 05:27.799
And then tragedy took all that away.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.089
John and Karen

05:29.090 --> 05:32.219
were driving home from a
team barbecue one day, and...

05:32.220 --> 05:37.389
But thank God their son Carter
had stayed behind with friends.

05:37.390 --> 05:38.589
They rounded a bend...

05:38.590 --> 05:40.549
Must be hard to hear.

05:40.550 --> 05:42.179
Well, it was harder losing Karen.

05:42.180 --> 05:44.639
I don't understand what this is.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.219
This is all part of trial science.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.179
We test out your case.

05:48.180 --> 05:50.719
Find the right strategy, narrative.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.089
My attorney isn't even here.

05:52.090 --> 05:53.219
Legal Aid lawyers often have

05:53.220 --> 05:55.639
30 to 40 active cases.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.469
He doesn't need to be here.

05:57.470 --> 06:00.349
This is so surreal.

06:00.350 --> 06:02.139
I lost my wife in a car accident

06:02.140 --> 06:03.969
and they think I'm a killer?

06:03.970 --> 06:05.509
Karen was everything to me.

06:05.510 --> 06:07.072
If I go to jail,

06:07.097 --> 06:09.010
- my son ends up in foster care.
- Hey.

06:09.013 --> 06:11.549
We're not gonna let that happen.

06:11.550 --> 06:13.009
This is a process.

06:13.010 --> 06:14.219
And it works.

06:14.220 --> 06:15.639
Come on.

06:17.890 --> 06:20.639
Pretty sophisticated equipment.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.389
Not cheap, either.

06:22.390 --> 06:24.089
Why are you doing this for me?

06:24.090 --> 06:25.389
Well, it isn't charity.

06:25.390 --> 06:27.259
You're getting me on
the good side of a judge

06:27.260 --> 06:29.849
who's presiding over a very
lucrative suit next month.

06:29.850 --> 06:32.179
And I'm not giving you any of my share.

06:32.180 --> 06:33.929
More importantly, we don't believe

06:33.930 --> 06:36.299
in letting people go to
jail for an accident.

06:36.300 --> 06:37.889
Everyone has their reasons.

06:37.890 --> 06:39.349
Dad?

06:39.350 --> 06:40.589
Hey.

06:40.590 --> 06:42.849
Hey, buddy.

06:42.850 --> 06:45.049
Listen, I'm a little short on cash.

06:45.050 --> 06:46.259
Can I settle up with you next week?

06:46.260 --> 06:47.799
No problem. I'll see you Monday.

06:47.800 --> 06:48.925
Bye, Carter.

06:48.926 --> 06:50.049
How was school?

06:50.050 --> 06:51.135
Okay.

06:51.136 --> 06:52.367
So...

06:53.180 --> 06:54.349
Brought your lawyer?

06:54.350 --> 06:55.679
I'm not a lawyer.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.139
Yeah, that's right.

06:57.140 --> 06:58.465
You're probably too smart to be a lawyer.

06:58.489 --> 07:00.235
Hey. Don't bias a nine-year-old.

07:00.260 --> 07:01.259
I'm still eight.

07:01.260 --> 07:03.639
In five months and
six days, I'll be nine.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.887
All right. See you soon, Dr. Bull.

07:05.912 --> 07:07.299
Carter, it's time to go.

07:07.300 --> 07:08.970
We have to get to your class.

07:09.970 --> 07:11.430
Nice to meet you, Carter.

07:16.180 --> 07:18.349
Cable. You said you found something?

07:18.350 --> 07:19.799
I found a troll.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.929
You and I have very different
definitions of "something."

07:22.930 --> 07:25.139
This guy is on the
Internet defending John,

07:25.140 --> 07:27.139
saying there's more to this story.

07:27.140 --> 07:28.259
How would he know?

07:28.260 --> 07:30.009
Well, that's why I started
chatting with him.

07:30.010 --> 07:32.139
He's pointing a finger at
this guy named Trevor Dormit.

07:32.140 --> 07:33.679
The state assemblyman.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.139
I asked him what Dormit
had to do with the crash

07:35.140 --> 07:37.049
and he's being pretty evasive.

07:37.050 --> 07:38.259
Is Dormit on the witness list?

07:38.260 --> 07:39.260
No.

07:39.930 --> 07:41.259
All right.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.679
Maybe he should be.

07:42.680 --> 07:44.049
Print out everything you have on him.

07:44.050 --> 07:45.179
Like on paper?

07:45.180 --> 07:46.679
No. Banana leaves.

07:46.680 --> 07:47.849
Yes, on paper.

07:47.850 --> 07:49.259
Doing this old school.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.259
Gonna need the visual.

07:51.260 --> 07:53.552
Line drive to left,

07:53.577 --> 07:55.300
- and that's a drive and a run.
- Come on.

07:55.303 --> 07:57.139
Yeah!

07:57.140 --> 07:58.799
Assemblyman Dormit.

07:58.800 --> 08:01.049
I'm Dr. Jason Bull. I'm sorry,

08:01.050 --> 08:02.969
there was nobody outside there.

08:02.970 --> 08:05.299
Marcy will be back in a minute;
She'll be able to help you.

08:05.300 --> 08:06.469
This will just take a moment.

08:06.470 --> 08:09.179
Um, a friend of mine is
on trial for manslaughter.

08:10.390 --> 08:11.509
This office could look into that,

08:11.510 --> 08:14.179
but really that is an issue for the DA.

08:14.180 --> 08:15.349
No. I know, that's why I'm here.

08:15.350 --> 08:16.849
Because I read all these online posts,

08:16.850 --> 08:19.469
and it seems you're involved in
the case against John Phillips?

08:19.470 --> 08:20.589
I don't know who that is.

08:20.590 --> 08:22.049
Well, that's the guy who was in

08:22.050 --> 08:24.179
this tragic accident
and he lost his wife.

08:24.180 --> 08:26.259
The maniac drunk driver.

08:26.260 --> 08:28.220
- And you were there.
- Yeah.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.389
Just a few cars back.

08:32.390 --> 08:34.506
Thank God I wasn't any closer,

08:34.532 --> 08:36.179
or I might not be here today.

08:36.179 --> 08:40.083
Well, I don't know if you
realize John was driving home

08:40.109 --> 08:43.219
from his eight-year-old
son's baseball game.

08:43.220 --> 08:45.349
A lot of criminals are fathers, sadly.

08:45.350 --> 08:46.429
Well, he's...

08:46.430 --> 08:47.799
not a drunk driver.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.889
Not a maniac, certainly,
not a criminal at all.

08:49.890 --> 08:51.679
He's just a single father now.

08:51.680 --> 08:53.640
He's lost his wife.

08:55.680 --> 08:58.009
You can leave your
information with Marcy.

08:58.010 --> 08:59.049
Assemblyman Dormit's office.

08:59.050 --> 09:00.089
Okay. Sorry.

09:00.090 --> 09:01.883
- Yeah.
- One... one last question.

09:01.908 --> 09:04.314
Are you the chief sponsor

09:04.315 --> 09:07.484
of the road improvement
bill for Nassau County?

09:07.485 --> 09:09.564
Because it seems that you
stand to benefit greatly

09:09.565 --> 09:12.854
from characterizing John's
accident as a criminal act.

09:12.855 --> 09:16.275
In fact, it seems you're the reason
John's on trial in the first place.

09:17.655 --> 09:18.905
- Marcy.
- Yes, sir?

09:18.908 --> 09:20.314
Call security, please.

09:20.315 --> 09:22.354
This man's refused repeated instructions

09:22.379 --> 09:23.694
to leave the office.

09:23.695 --> 09:25.694
He might be armed.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.404
Right away, sir.

09:27.405 --> 09:29.234
That won't be necessary.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.564
You know, before you came in here,

09:31.565 --> 09:33.694
I was on the fence about taking the time

09:33.695 --> 09:35.154
to testify against Phillips,

09:35.155 --> 09:38.945
but now, I guess, I'll see you in court.

09:42.735 --> 09:45.655
I'm looking forward to that.

09:56.537 --> 09:59.036
Hey there, Marissa,
I'm putting you on speaker.

09:59.037 --> 10:01.286
How'd you get Dormit to testify?

10:01.287 --> 10:03.746
Classic high-conflict behavior.

10:03.747 --> 10:07.036
Instead of resolving problems,
he likes to escalate them.

10:07.037 --> 10:08.175
Well done!

10:08.200 --> 10:10.036
You can put him on the
stand just like you wanted.

10:10.037 --> 10:12.627
Now that you got your wish, what's next?

10:12.630 --> 10:14.626
Police. Pull over.

10:14.627 --> 10:16.321
I'll let you
know when I get back.

10:16.345 --> 10:17.626
First I have to pay for my wish.

10:17.627 --> 10:18.746
What do you mean?

10:18.747 --> 10:21.206
Police! Pull over now.

10:21.207 --> 10:23.166
Dormit must have
told local law enforcement

10:23.167 --> 10:24.956
I was driving through.

10:24.957 --> 10:27.087
Bye.

10:27.587 --> 10:30.746
License and registration.

10:30.747 --> 10:33.246
Sure thing, Officer.

10:33.247 --> 10:36.786
Do you mind if I ask what I did wrong?

10:36.787 --> 10:38.706
I don't know if you're
aware of New York laws, sir,

10:38.707 --> 10:40.496
but it's a hands-free state.

10:40.497 --> 10:42.456
In the car. I assume it's safe

10:42.457 --> 10:43.667
to use our hands other places.

10:44.865 --> 10:47.115
Please step out of the car.

10:49.905 --> 10:51.784
Can I use my hands?

10:51.785 --> 10:53.155
You're a funny guy?

10:55.365 --> 10:57.454
Hi.

10:57.455 --> 10:59.654
Good.

10:59.655 --> 11:01.994
We're pooling our
resources to pay your fine.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.871
FYI, Marissa wouldn't give up her watch.

11:03.896 --> 11:05.185
I take it the assemblyman

11:05.210 --> 11:06.994
had something to do with your citation.

11:06.995 --> 11:08.994
A small price to pay for the pleasure

11:08.995 --> 11:10.784
of his company in court.

11:10.785 --> 11:13.284
So, the prosecution's plan

11:13.285 --> 11:16.534
is to get the jury's attention
focused on the small details.

11:16.535 --> 11:18.534
Yep. Beer, the speeding.

11:18.535 --> 11:20.494
Looking angry as he passed Dormit.

11:20.495 --> 11:23.534
But now we put those details
into a larger context.

11:23.535 --> 11:24.744
With Dormit on the stand?

11:24.745 --> 11:26.994
And with a jury full of people

11:26.995 --> 11:29.074
who don't get hung up on the details.

11:29.075 --> 11:30.296
Like Benny.

11:30.321 --> 11:31.611
- Thanks?
- No judgment.

11:31.636 --> 11:33.502
That's just how the Benny brain works.

11:33.527 --> 11:35.574
What brand of shoes was
Marissa wearing yesterday?

11:35.575 --> 11:36.784
What color was her jacket?

11:36.785 --> 11:37.784
I don't remember.

11:37.785 --> 11:38.740
But she looked great.

11:38.741 --> 11:39.694
Thank you.

11:39.695 --> 11:40.829
Manolos.

11:40.854 --> 11:42.976
And a winter white jacket
over an emerald crew neck.

11:43.001 --> 11:43.784
Very elegant.

11:43.785 --> 11:44.994
Okay. That's probably enough

11:44.995 --> 11:46.143
about my fashion choices.

11:46.168 --> 11:48.995
I take it we wouldn't want
a detective on our jury.

11:49.020 --> 11:50.574
No. On this one

11:50.575 --> 11:52.768
we need people who only
think of the big picture.

11:52.793 --> 11:54.324
Intuitive thinkers.

11:54.325 --> 11:57.074
Jury selection is never perfect.

11:57.099 --> 11:59.326
That's why we have a head start.

11:59.351 --> 12:01.062
This is tomorrow's jury pool.

12:01.063 --> 12:02.402
How did you get... I mean,

12:02.403 --> 12:04.612
nobody gets this in advance.

12:04.613 --> 12:05.834
We do.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.014
Better not to ask.

12:07.039 --> 12:08.982
Cable's running through
their social media.

12:08.983 --> 12:11.982
Court records... anything that tells
us who these people are.

12:11.983 --> 12:13.153
And who to avoid.

12:13.154 --> 12:14.322
But in voir dire,

12:14.323 --> 12:16.982
you can't just ask people if
they get hung up on details.

12:16.983 --> 12:19.862
You're gonna ask these questions.

12:19.863 --> 12:21.188
Do you prefer

12:21.213 --> 12:22.652
cooking or baking?

12:22.677 --> 12:24.946
Mr. Foster, please. I'm hungry.

12:24.971 --> 12:27.415
Don't try my patience before lunch.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.982
Judge Bergen's probably gonna
give you a little bit of flack.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.095
Don't worry.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.751
You can ask anything you want in court.

12:32.776 --> 12:34.540
Cooking or baking?

12:34.565 --> 12:36.451
Bakers are precise.

12:36.476 --> 12:39.278
They have to follow the
recipe exactly, details matter.

12:39.303 --> 12:40.912
Cooking.

12:40.937 --> 12:42.508
It's more about the feel of the dish.

12:42.509 --> 12:43.968
I sort of wing it, though,

12:43.969 --> 12:45.508
'cause I never have the
right stuff in my fridge.

12:45.509 --> 12:47.058
So people who cook

12:47.059 --> 12:48.968
will be more open to John's story.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.678
Cooking or baking?

12:50.679 --> 12:52.258
Baking.

12:52.283 --> 12:53.969
But not all that vegan

12:53.994 --> 12:56.494
gluten-free, taste-free crap.

12:57.638 --> 12:59.588
We move to strike this juror.

13:01.349 --> 13:03.218
Don't smile.

13:03.219 --> 13:05.178
You can't smile.

13:05.179 --> 13:06.298
You didn't just win the lottery.

13:06.299 --> 13:07.678
You struck a juror.

13:07.679 --> 13:08.968
You give anything away,

13:08.969 --> 13:10.664
the prosecution will catch on.

13:10.689 --> 13:11.744
So just show me.

13:12.599 --> 13:13.848
Yeah, but don't look nervous.

13:13.849 --> 13:16.428
Show me your neutral face.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.218
That's more sad clown.

13:18.219 --> 13:20.508
We'll work on this. Don't think about it.

13:20.509 --> 13:22.388
Boy.

13:22.389 --> 13:23.388
Cooking.

13:23.389 --> 13:25.058
No patience for baking.

13:25.059 --> 13:27.008
Acceptable to the defense.

13:27.009 --> 13:28.718
Mr. Mercado?

13:28.719 --> 13:30.389
Acceptable, Your Honor.

13:31.799 --> 13:34.008
It looks like we have a jury.

13:34.033 --> 13:37.428
Participating in a criminal case
as a juror is an important duty.

13:37.429 --> 13:39.388
We will attempt to keep
any inconvenience to you

13:39.389 --> 13:41.178
at a minimum. I would like to remind you

13:41.179 --> 13:43.758
as a juror there are some
guidelines you need to follow.

13:43.759 --> 13:45.468
I spend my weekends bird watching.

13:45.469 --> 13:46.888
I spend my weekends bird watching.

13:46.889 --> 13:48.298
I'm married with four kids.

13:48.299 --> 13:49.678
I'm married with four kids.

13:49.679 --> 13:51.178
I am an account executive.

13:51.179 --> 13:52.888
Still single.

13:52.889 --> 13:55.298
We have identified the 12 mirror jurors.

13:55.299 --> 13:56.558
How'd we fare?

13:56.559 --> 13:57.678
Mostly good.

13:57.679 --> 13:58.848
However... Sorry.

13:58.849 --> 14:00.718
The mirror jury has led me to believe

14:00.719 --> 14:02.558
that this juror could be an issue.

14:02.559 --> 14:04.508
Arthur Jolene.

14:04.509 --> 14:06.630
His pulsed spiked when he
saw that John was speeding.

14:06.655 --> 14:08.508
He pays all his bills on time. And...

14:08.509 --> 14:10.508
He's a birdwatcher. Oy.

14:10.509 --> 14:13.428
He's kept a hand-written
log for the last 19 years.

14:13.429 --> 14:17.008
He can spot all 476 species in New York.

14:17.009 --> 14:18.298
And he's still single?

14:18.299 --> 14:19.100
Can you believe it?

14:19.125 --> 14:21.678
Speaking of that winter
white jacket and Manolos...

14:21.679 --> 14:22.759
- Not again.
- Wait a minute.

14:22.762 --> 14:23.848
I want in on this.

14:23.849 --> 14:25.848
She's worn a new outfit twice this week.

14:25.849 --> 14:28.888
And she left the office
at 7:30 last night,

14:28.889 --> 14:31.968
which never happens, so what's going on?

14:31.969 --> 14:35.098
I am pretty sure this is why the
phrase "none of your business"

14:35.099 --> 14:36.388
was originally invent...

14:37.679 --> 14:39.348
Sorry. Don't know my own strength.

14:39.349 --> 14:41.058
That was at least 16 feet.

14:41.059 --> 14:42.598
Yes, it was.

14:42.599 --> 14:44.428
All right, big guy. You're at bat.

14:44.429 --> 14:45.508
Show me what ya got.

14:45.509 --> 14:49.069
Now, I hear that you're a Mets fan.

14:49.094 --> 14:51.092
I'm not gonna hold that against you.
Who's your favorite player?

14:51.116 --> 14:52.178
Cespedes.

14:52.179 --> 14:56.428
He's averaging almost 300,
but July 5 he hit 305,

14:56.429 --> 15:00.138
and April 29, starting up
against the Giants, he hit 313.

15:00.139 --> 15:03.008
Wow. Nice stats.

15:03.009 --> 15:05.349
Show me your stance.

15:10.599 --> 15:13.678
You all right there, kiddo?

15:13.679 --> 15:15.508
Getting ready takes a sec.

15:15.509 --> 15:17.468
Warm up for you.

15:20.299 --> 15:22.218
Man, missed it.

15:22.219 --> 15:24.138
That was a good cut. Bad pitch.

15:24.139 --> 15:27.138
So you got some Major League
scouts looking at you?

15:27.139 --> 15:28.759
Nah, I'm not on the team anymore.

15:34.599 --> 15:36.428
All right. Let's take another cut.

15:36.429 --> 15:38.179
Eyes on the ball this time.

15:39.139 --> 15:40.968
Whoa!

15:40.969 --> 15:43.388
Talked to all the parents from the game?

15:43.389 --> 15:45.218
Minus two who are more evasive.

15:45.219 --> 15:46.598
But we have character witnesses.

15:46.599 --> 15:48.008
John checks out like father of the year.

15:48.009 --> 15:51.033
Anyone mention why John
took Carter off the team?

15:51.058 --> 15:52.598
One dad thinks it has to do

15:52.599 --> 15:54.058
with the accident, the trial.

15:54.059 --> 15:55.388
Talk to everyone.

15:55.389 --> 15:57.178
Find out what kind of player Carter was.

15:58.055 --> 15:59.055
Lurla Gray?

16:03.139 --> 16:04.888
Maybe.

16:04.889 --> 16:06.798
Are you the one who called
about John Phillips?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.199
Your sons played baseball together.

16:09.679 --> 16:11.468
Ma'am?

16:11.469 --> 16:13.218
I worked for the FBI.

16:13.219 --> 16:16.889
This gnome you have guarding
your door isn't gonna deter me.

16:18.969 --> 16:20.508
I told them I was done talking.

16:20.509 --> 16:21.848
I don't want to be involved.

16:21.849 --> 16:22.889
Told who?

16:22.890 --> 16:26.038
The DA. He promised to protect
me if I handed over the video.

16:26.063 --> 16:27.159
Ma'am, what video?

16:41.469 --> 16:43.968
I want to win games out there.

16:43.969 --> 16:46.451
Listen, maybe you find a
different sport for your son.

16:46.476 --> 16:48.508
Okay. That's not good, John.

16:48.509 --> 16:50.968
Attacking a coach supports
the prosecution's case

16:50.969 --> 16:53.218
that he drove in an agitated state.

16:53.219 --> 16:55.759
And then you got in the car?

16:56.850 --> 17:00.520
This is a detail the jury may
have a hard time ignoring.

17:10.951 --> 17:12.780
Look, I know it looks bad,

17:12.781 --> 17:15.950
but there's a perfectly good...

17:15.951 --> 17:18.002
I don't know, maybe it's
not very good, but...

17:20.231 --> 17:21.984
That guy there, Gary,
he's one of the dads

17:22.010 --> 17:23.160
that coaches Carter's team.

17:23.161 --> 17:26.990
And he benches Carter every
game until the last inning,

17:26.991 --> 17:28.240
when it doesn't even matter.

17:28.241 --> 17:29.954
Is it a competitive league?

17:29.979 --> 17:31.398
These kids are eight years old.

17:31.399 --> 17:33.308
But he's acting like they're
going to the World Series.

17:33.309 --> 17:35.595
He, he has the same three kids

17:35.620 --> 17:36.978
riding the pine every game.

17:36.979 --> 17:38.188
Not his kid, I bet.

17:38.189 --> 17:39.308
So you shoved him.

17:39.309 --> 17:40.688
I only went to go talk to him.

17:40.689 --> 17:43.398
In private so it wasn't a thing
in front of the other parents,

17:43.399 --> 17:44.898
but then he starts acting
like it was my fault.

17:44.899 --> 17:46.268
Carter's fault.

17:46.269 --> 17:47.558
And then he says, "Maybe your kid"

17:47.559 --> 17:50.059
"should find another sport." And...

17:51.467 --> 17:52.427
I just snapped.

17:52.428 --> 17:53.386
John.

17:53.387 --> 17:55.266
These are the kinds of
things we need to know.

17:55.267 --> 17:57.386
The prosecution has the video.

17:57.387 --> 17:59.466
And Mercado's gonna
lead with it at trial.

17:59.467 --> 18:01.266
It'll make the case that you
were in an agitated state

18:01.267 --> 18:02.966
before you got behind the wheel.

18:02.967 --> 18:06.266
This gives the prosecution
grounds for manslaughter.

18:06.267 --> 18:08.466
We'll be ready.

18:08.467 --> 18:10.307
For whatever they throw at us.

18:11.467 --> 18:13.556
In the car crash that killed...

18:13.557 --> 18:15.982
No, nope, nope, nope, sorry.

18:16.007 --> 18:18.216
I kno... I know you said you
were gonna jump in,

18:18.217 --> 18:20.336
I just assumed I'd get a
whole sentence in first.

18:20.337 --> 18:22.086
Don't use the word "crash."

18:22.087 --> 18:24.006
It's "accident," "tragedy," "loss."

18:24.007 --> 18:25.336
Those are the magic words.

18:25.337 --> 18:26.666
Especially around Arthur Jolene.

18:26.667 --> 18:27.966
Who?

18:27.967 --> 18:29.216
Juror Number Two.

18:29.217 --> 18:31.046
And the other two who
will cluster around him.

18:31.047 --> 18:32.547
- Cluster?
- Jurors Number Eight and Nine

18:32.550 --> 18:34.466
will follow the strongest personality

18:34.467 --> 18:36.296
with whom they share similar traits.

18:36.297 --> 18:37.376
That's Arthur.

18:40.241 --> 18:42.701
This tragic accident...

18:42.726 --> 18:43.888
Why are you standing there?

18:43.913 --> 18:45.257
- I'm talking to Arthur.
- Okay.

18:45.258 --> 18:46.871
But when you're talking about John,

18:46.896 --> 18:48.506
it actually helps to stand near him.

18:48.507 --> 18:51.166
That'll subconsciously associate John

18:51.167 --> 18:53.296
with the positive words in
the jurors' brains.

18:53.297 --> 18:53.932
Okay.

18:53.957 --> 18:55.837
But not when you mention
the negative details.

18:55.840 --> 18:57.046
Like the fight with the coach.

18:57.047 --> 18:58.756
No. They didn't have a fight.

18:58.757 --> 19:01.546
He confronted a hot-headed coach

19:01.547 --> 19:03.166
who was taking the game too seriously.

19:04.202 --> 19:05.546
Will it even matter where I stand

19:05.547 --> 19:06.626
once they've seen that video?

19:06.627 --> 19:08.116
Everything matters.

19:08.141 --> 19:09.241
The coach won't testify,

19:09.266 --> 19:12.256
so Danny's talking to
him now to find out why.

19:12.257 --> 19:14.426
John's right, I want to
win baseball games,

19:14.427 --> 19:16.546
and there's no rule that says
you got to play all the kids

19:16.547 --> 19:18.126
the same amount of time.

19:18.127 --> 19:19.506
But I don't blame John for what happened.

19:19.507 --> 19:20.899
He's a decent guy, he means well.

19:20.924 --> 19:21.966
When you said that,

19:21.991 --> 19:24.080
the prosecution chose not
to call you to the stand.

19:24.105 --> 19:26.876
I made it pretty clear that
I don't want to get involved.

19:26.877 --> 19:29.876
John doesn't deserve this,
and I feel for Carter.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.126
Even though you benched him?

19:31.127 --> 19:33.546
The kid is terrible.

19:33.547 --> 19:35.466
And I don't want him to
lose his dad to prison

19:35.467 --> 19:37.006
after he just lost his mom.

19:37.007 --> 19:40.296
Would you be willing to testify
that you instigated the fight?

19:40.297 --> 19:41.836
No.

19:41.837 --> 19:43.046
John lost it.

19:43.047 --> 19:44.376
Don't get me wrong.

19:44.377 --> 19:46.546
Parents go bananas
out there all the time.

19:46.547 --> 19:47.966
Last week a shortstop's dad

19:47.967 --> 19:49.296
was critiquing another kid's hitting,

19:49.297 --> 19:51.507
got a snow cone to the face.

19:51.510 --> 19:53.796
I told you, it doesn't make
any of us look much better.

19:53.821 --> 19:56.069
Is there anything that you
could tell me that might help?

19:56.070 --> 19:58.256
Well, I didn't tell the DA guy this,

19:58.257 --> 20:00.506
but Karen called right
after from the car.

20:00.507 --> 20:02.756
- And?
- She wanted to apologize.

20:02.757 --> 20:05.212
Had something to explain, but then
John yelled at her and she hung up.

20:05.213 --> 20:07.086
- Explain what?
- I don't know.

20:07.087 --> 20:10.716
Look, I wish him well.

20:10.717 --> 20:11.780
Thank you.

20:11.805 --> 20:15.336
So he fought with the coach and
his wife before the accident?

20:15.337 --> 20:17.313
- All part of the same fight.
- It's not helping.

20:17.338 --> 20:19.586
I debriefed the mirror jury
after they saw the video,

20:19.611 --> 20:22.040
looks like we only have
five of 12 on John's side.

20:22.041 --> 20:23.256
Three guiltys.

20:23.257 --> 20:25.986
Arthur Jolene, and the
two clustering around him.

20:26.011 --> 20:27.315
Think the fight's clear evidence

20:27.340 --> 20:29.126
that John's an angry guy
who shouldn't have gotten

20:29.127 --> 20:30.837
- behind the wheel.
- John was angry.

20:30.840 --> 20:33.506
But he's not an angry guy,
and the jury needs to see that.

20:33.507 --> 20:34.796
You working a theory?

20:34.797 --> 20:37.214
First, we have to dispense
with Assemblyman Dormit.

20:37.239 --> 20:39.256
Assuming Gil follows the plan.

20:39.257 --> 20:41.126
Dormit eats lawyers like Gil for lunch.

20:41.127 --> 20:42.260
For breakfast.

20:42.285 --> 20:43.876
It's the most important meal of the day.

20:43.877 --> 20:44.926
I think it's lunch.

20:44.927 --> 20:47.126
Gil will not be eaten.

20:47.127 --> 20:50.586
Now, someone needs to go
through John's insurance claims

20:50.587 --> 20:51.756
for the last five years.

20:51.757 --> 20:52.734
Medical.

20:52.759 --> 20:54.506
It's not exactly legal, is it?

20:54.507 --> 20:56.586
Well, then, it's a good thing
no one here is doing it.

20:56.587 --> 20:58.466
Especially not... Cable!

20:58.467 --> 21:00.666
Today?

21:00.667 --> 21:02.376
Judge Lamkin.

21:02.377 --> 21:04.626
I'll meet you guys in there.

21:04.627 --> 21:07.049
Now, you don't work at this courthouse.

21:07.074 --> 21:08.793
No. But I do live in Nassau County.

21:10.257 --> 21:11.466
You're taking my advice.

21:11.467 --> 21:13.046
Running for State Assembly.

21:13.047 --> 21:15.190
It's something I've wanted
to do for years,

21:15.215 --> 21:17.046
but I never really thought I had a shot.

21:18.108 --> 21:19.166
Are you sure about this?

21:19.167 --> 21:20.317
100%.

21:20.318 --> 21:21.751
Then I'm off to file.

21:30.007 --> 21:32.716
Assemblyman Dormit, can you

21:32.717 --> 21:33.652
identify the driver?

21:33.653 --> 21:35.716
Yeah, he's sitting right over there.

21:35.717 --> 21:38.046
Well, I was trying to switch lanes

21:38.047 --> 21:40.046
so he could pass, but

21:40.047 --> 21:41.926
he was already swerving around me.

21:41.927 --> 21:43.586
Nearly ran me off the road.

21:43.587 --> 21:45.046
Gave me an angry look.

21:45.047 --> 21:46.256
I thought maybe he was drunk.

21:46.281 --> 21:49.666
Objection, assumes facts not in evidence.

21:49.667 --> 21:51.626
And actually,
we have John's blood alcohol level

21:51.627 --> 21:52.716
on record as being

21:52.717 --> 21:54.626
below the legal limit, so,

21:54.627 --> 21:56.107
assumes lies not in evidence.

21:56.108 --> 21:57.586
That's not actually a thing,

21:57.587 --> 21:59.796
Mr. Foster, but point taken.

21:59.797 --> 22:01.426
And then what happened?

22:01.427 --> 22:04.046
Then I saw the road sign. It said.

22:04.047 --> 22:06.586
"Slow: Congestion Ahead."

22:06.587 --> 22:08.796
So I slowed down. And as I

22:08.797 --> 22:12.006
rounded the bend I saw the
huge crash he'd caused.

22:12.007 --> 22:14.756
Thank you. That's all.

22:14.757 --> 22:17.466
Mr. Dormit, would you happen to know

22:17.467 --> 22:19.626
how many drivers are prosecuted

22:19.627 --> 22:21.546
for car accidents in this district?

22:21.547 --> 22:23.877
- Not off the top of my head, no.
- Well, even when

22:23.902 --> 22:26.127
there's a fatality, it's less than

22:26.152 --> 22:28.541
- five percent of the time, right?
- I guess.

22:28.566 --> 22:30.337
- Something like that.
- Which would certainly

22:30.340 --> 22:32.046
makes it seem like John's

22:32.047 --> 22:35.406
- being unfairly singled out.
- Get to a question, Mr. Foster.

22:35.431 --> 22:36.703
Do you have an agenda,

22:36.728 --> 22:39.125
Mr. Dormit? After the accident,

22:39.150 --> 22:40.664
did you call your friend

22:40.665 --> 22:42.998
and golf buddy, the district attorney,

22:43.023 --> 22:45.874
and personally request
that John be charged?

22:45.875 --> 22:47.794
That is moronic.

22:47.795 --> 22:50.164
Name calling is not

22:50.165 --> 22:51.585
the same as giving an answer.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.494
Gil put his first
points on the board.

23:00.495 --> 23:04.454
Look at the spike in vitals on
his mirror juror's biometer.

23:04.455 --> 23:06.834
A crack in Arthur Jolene's cluster.

23:06.835 --> 23:08.624
Not hard to tap into people's outrage

23:08.625 --> 23:10.164
against the abuse of power.

23:10.165 --> 23:12.084
Juror number nine swore
he'd never vote again

23:12.085 --> 23:13.978
after the last election.

23:14.003 --> 23:16.584
How many speeches did you give
after John's wreck in support

23:16.585 --> 23:19.697
of a new highway
project in your district?

23:19.722 --> 23:21.334
I give a lot of speeches.

23:21.335 --> 23:23.794
Six.

23:23.795 --> 23:25.334
By the way,

23:25.335 --> 23:29.294
I love the slogan from
your last election.

23:29.295 --> 23:31.124
"All roads lead to Dormit."

23:31.125 --> 23:32.534
It's catchy.

23:32.535 --> 23:33.744
You sponsored the roads.

23:33.745 --> 23:36.535
- Objection. Relevance.
- The next words better be relevant,

23:36.538 --> 23:37.915
Mr. Foster.

23:39.245 --> 23:41.124
Mr. Dormit, do you have something

23:41.125 --> 23:43.414
to personally gain from
John's conviction,

23:43.439 --> 23:45.717
perhaps having something to do with

23:45.718 --> 23:47.954
the road improvement
bill for Nassau County

23:47.955 --> 23:49.454
that you sponsored?

23:49.455 --> 23:51.124
Isn't it true that your brother

23:51.125 --> 23:54.029
owns a concrete factory?

23:54.054 --> 23:55.794
I'm not saying there were kickbacks...

23:55.795 --> 23:56.795
- Now, hold on...
- You hold on.

23:56.798 --> 23:58.084
Now, who the hell are you?

23:58.085 --> 24:01.124
Those projects were fair, created jobs...

24:01.125 --> 24:02.165
For your family.

24:03.665 --> 24:05.034
He's the criminal.

24:05.035 --> 24:06.914
Right there.

24:06.915 --> 24:08.795
He is.

24:14.535 --> 24:16.624
Marissa says we gained a few.

24:16.625 --> 24:18.244
Where's John?

24:18.245 --> 24:20.624
He went outside to cool off.

24:20.625 --> 24:23.954
Can't blame him for not
being Dormit's biggest fan.

24:23.955 --> 24:26.624
Remember the first thing I
told you when you joined TAC?

24:26.625 --> 24:29.584
You said never stop at
a client's first confession.

24:29.585 --> 24:32.245
It's only the beginning.

24:32.270 --> 24:33.809
John.

24:33.834 --> 24:35.294
- Hey, Dr. Bull.
- Hey.

24:35.295 --> 24:36.954
John, slow down. Hey...

24:36.955 --> 24:38.874
it's one thing to stare
down Dormit in court,

24:38.875 --> 24:40.421
it's another to confront him in his car.

24:40.445 --> 24:42.795
- I don't care anymore, okay?
- What would a jury think?

24:42.798 --> 24:44.084
You have to think.

24:44.085 --> 24:45.705
- He is ruining my life.
- Shh, shh.

24:45.708 --> 24:47.294
He doesn't care about your life.

24:47.295 --> 24:48.744
He's a political opportunist, okay?

24:48.745 --> 24:51.294
And that may be pathetic and awful,

24:51.295 --> 24:53.034
but he's not your biggest problem.

24:53.035 --> 24:55.455
You are.

25:00.585 --> 25:04.084
John, what were you and Karen
fighting about before the crash?

25:04.085 --> 25:06.704
It was nothing.

25:06.705 --> 25:08.983
I mean, she was mad that
I went after the coach.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.220
Because he didn't know about Carter.

25:11.245 --> 25:13.704
There's nothing wrong with my son.

25:13.705 --> 25:15.874
You can hide it all you want,

25:15.875 --> 25:18.035
but it's all I see.

25:23.531 --> 25:25.441
Carter's had his challenges, hasn't he?

25:27.611 --> 25:29.570
He has some kind of, um,

25:29.571 --> 25:31.570
motor planning disorder.

25:31.571 --> 25:32.570
I know.

25:32.571 --> 25:34.230
He's been in physical therapy

25:34.231 --> 25:36.320
for the last two years.

25:36.321 --> 25:38.530
Three times a week.

25:40.031 --> 25:42.360
He's just as good as
any of these other kids.

25:42.361 --> 25:44.900
He just has to work twice as hard.

25:44.901 --> 25:47.190
So...

25:47.191 --> 25:48.680
when he got benched, you know, I just...

25:48.704 --> 25:50.274
Yeah, but why don't you
just tell the coach

25:50.298 --> 25:51.610
he needs a little extra help?

25:51.611 --> 25:53.530
Karen wanted to, but I-I...

25:53.531 --> 25:55.571
I-I don't want people
treating him differently.

26:01.861 --> 26:04.570
But in the car,

26:04.571 --> 26:07.440
she said that I was ashamed.

26:07.441 --> 26:09.441
Of my own son.

26:12.401 --> 26:14.440
And that's what you
were fighting about...

26:14.441 --> 26:15.980
Carter, watch your stance!

26:15.981 --> 26:17.691
Before the crash.

26:20.071 --> 26:22.690
This is something you
have to tell the jury.

26:22.691 --> 26:24.571
- They will understand, too.
- No.

26:24.574 --> 26:25.770
No.

26:25.771 --> 26:28.401
This stays between us.

26:37.901 --> 26:39.901
Have a seat.

26:43.981 --> 26:46.440
Look, I'll testify, but...

26:46.441 --> 26:48.980
I don't see how I could
possibly be a good witness.

26:48.981 --> 26:51.900
John, you and your wife loved
each other very much.

26:51.901 --> 26:53.030
I've seen it in the photos,

26:53.031 --> 26:55.110
in the stories, everything Carter says.

26:55.111 --> 26:56.191
I know, but...

26:56.192 --> 26:57.270
And you had a fight.

26:57.271 --> 26:59.443
Like every other married
couple on the planet.

26:59.468 --> 27:01.998
Dr. Bull, you don't understand. The
way that we yelled... it was...

27:02.022 --> 27:03.480
It wasn't the first time
that you fought about

27:03.481 --> 27:06.018
whether or not to tell someone
about Carter's condition,

27:06.043 --> 27:07.463
was it?

27:08.481 --> 27:11.070
I know this isn't easy,
but neither is hiding it.

27:11.071 --> 27:12.071
I'm not hiding it.

27:16.443 --> 27:18.562
I just... I want him to
have a real childhood.

27:18.587 --> 27:20.966
I mean, you start talking to people,

27:20.967 --> 27:22.546
and... he doesn't get on a team,

27:22.547 --> 27:23.967
he gets singled out.

27:26.047 --> 27:28.467
You know, nothing should hold him back.

27:31.507 --> 27:33.836
That's what I want you
to say on the stand.

27:33.837 --> 27:35.506
No. I'm...

27:35.507 --> 27:38.506
I'm not using my son to win
the sympathy of strangers.

27:38.507 --> 27:42.007
I got to go to work.

27:47.467 --> 27:49.876
Hey, why aren't you bantering
with your Internet troll friend?

27:49.877 --> 27:51.966
He, went dark.

27:51.967 --> 27:55.021
Why? I thought he
was following John's case.

27:55.046 --> 27:56.426
Gave you the Dormit intel.

27:56.427 --> 27:58.256
I know. I thought he'd be all

27:58.257 --> 28:00.046
excited about Dormit's flailing in court.

28:00.047 --> 28:01.876
He's a good hacker, too.

28:01.877 --> 28:03.666
But he's really hard to find.

28:03.667 --> 28:05.375
Well, you know what Bull would say?

28:05.400 --> 28:07.506
Something cryptic that
takes me days to understand?

28:07.507 --> 28:09.506
Cable, when you're a hammer,

28:09.507 --> 28:11.426
everything looks like a nail.

28:11.427 --> 28:13.166
You're coming at it like a hacker.

28:13.167 --> 28:14.836
Right? Only looking online.

28:14.837 --> 28:16.426
But you got to think big picture.

28:16.427 --> 28:18.586
This guy's sympathizing with John.

28:18.587 --> 28:19.667
Why?

28:20.649 --> 28:22.166
Gil's cross of Dormit

28:22.167 --> 28:23.426
convinced two fence-sitters

28:23.427 --> 28:26.046
that John is getting unfairly railroaded.

28:26.047 --> 28:27.836
Oof. I'm not sure we can

28:27.837 --> 28:30.126
get the other two if John
won't explain the whole story

28:30.127 --> 28:32.716
behind the fight. If the jury
hears the whole context,

28:32.717 --> 28:34.674
they'll see John as a loving father,

28:34.699 --> 28:37.126
not as an angry driver. But...

28:37.127 --> 28:39.716
without that, they'll default
to the prosecution's version.

28:39.717 --> 28:42.046
And our cluster's still
holding firm around Bird-man?

28:42.047 --> 28:43.796
Well, we observed jurors eight and two

28:43.797 --> 28:45.876
at a nearby cafeteria
agreeing with each other

28:45.877 --> 28:49.506
that Gil's new cross of
Dormit was weak at best.

28:49.507 --> 28:51.666
His mirror juror's still
hung up on the road sign.

28:51.667 --> 28:53.666
Dormit mentioned.
Can't see how John missed it.

28:53.667 --> 28:55.506
So we'll do a better job
at convincing him

28:55.507 --> 28:56.514
the sign's irrelevant.

28:56.539 --> 28:57.827
It's not that easy...

28:57.852 --> 28:59.506
He's not naturally an intuitive thinker,

28:59.507 --> 29:01.086
you can't change him in a day.
It's like trying

29:01.087 --> 29:04.046
to get an introvert to
be the life of the party.

29:04.047 --> 29:04.990
So what do we do?

29:05.015 --> 29:06.757
Let's forget about
Arthur for the moment.

29:06.760 --> 29:07.922
Shore up our maybes.

29:07.923 --> 29:09.086
How?

29:09.087 --> 29:10.586
John said he won't talk.

29:10.587 --> 29:12.586
Correct.

29:12.587 --> 29:15.467
But we can have Gil bring
up Carter's condition.

29:16.667 --> 29:18.926
You want me to ambush my
own client on the stand?

29:18.927 --> 29:19.777
Gil...

29:19.778 --> 29:20.626
No. No way.

29:20.627 --> 29:23.126
My job is to tend to
the needs of the client.

29:23.127 --> 29:26.466
Your job is to make sure that
John does not rot in prison.

29:26.467 --> 29:28.466
Your job is to make sure that his son

29:28.467 --> 29:30.507
doesn't end up in foster care.

29:36.311 --> 29:38.206
The game is done, all right?

29:38.231 --> 29:39.110
He has to sit on the bench...

29:39.111 --> 29:40.190
wasn't trying to do nothing.

29:40.191 --> 29:41.690
I want to win games out there.

29:41.691 --> 29:43.150
What is-what is this,
the World Series?

29:43.151 --> 29:45.271
Listen, maybe you find a
different sport for your son.

29:46.071 --> 29:48.480
And then you shoved the coach?

29:48.481 --> 29:50.150
I pushed him.

29:50.151 --> 29:52.110
I know that that video
looks awful and,

29:52.111 --> 29:54.270
believe me, I'm not proud of it.

29:54.271 --> 29:57.030
Why do you think the coach doesn't

29:57.031 --> 29:59.150
want to play Carter as
much as the other kids?

29:59.151 --> 30:02.610
I'm not saying that he's
a top player, but Carter

30:02.611 --> 30:05.510
should be able to play
more than just last inning.

30:05.535 --> 30:08.334
Carter had any trouble keeping
up with the other kids?

30:08.335 --> 30:09.454
No.

30:09.455 --> 30:10.955
What's that supposed to mean?

30:13.585 --> 30:14.624
John,

30:14.625 --> 30:16.735
I have some documents here from.

30:16.760 --> 30:18.840
Carter's developmental pediatrician.

30:21.535 --> 30:22.954
They speak to some challenges

30:22.955 --> 30:24.915
he's faced in the past 18 months.

30:26.535 --> 30:28.034
Tell us

30:28.035 --> 30:29.664
what was really going through your head

30:29.665 --> 30:32.125
when you went to talk to the coach.

30:47.000 --> 30:50.994
Carter has a motor planning disorder.

30:50.995 --> 30:52.890
He's a smart kid,

30:52.915 --> 30:54.484
he's the best kid in the world,

30:54.509 --> 30:58.145
it just takes him some
extra practice to...

31:01.937 --> 31:04.306
I'm sorry, I, um,

31:04.331 --> 31:05.914
I didn't come here today

31:05.939 --> 31:07.751
to talk about Carter.
I just-I just never wanted him

31:07.775 --> 31:11.025
to be, treated differently,
to be seen as weak.

31:18.585 --> 31:20.675
Karen wanted me to tell people.

31:22.875 --> 31:25.465
And Karen was the smartest
person that I know.

31:33.645 --> 31:35.144
We won over the maybes,

31:35.169 --> 31:37.794
but Arthur is still hung
up on the road sign.

31:37.795 --> 31:40.334
He needs one more detail to latch on to.

31:40.335 --> 31:42.504
I might have a lead on that.

31:42.505 --> 31:44.004
And you've been withholding?

31:44.005 --> 31:44.940
You're one to talk.

31:44.941 --> 31:45.874
What do you mean?

31:45.875 --> 31:47.874
The new dresses, leaving at 7:30.

31:47.875 --> 31:48.907
You're dating someone.

31:48.932 --> 31:50.447
And you're being unusually
cagey about it.

31:50.471 --> 31:52.544
Yeah, don't make me do a deep dive.

31:52.545 --> 31:54.374
Hey, we have one rule around here.

31:54.375 --> 31:56.584
No investigating teammates.

31:56.585 --> 31:58.674
Then you shouldn't work with
a team of investigators, lady.

31:58.675 --> 32:00.714
Arthur is not interested
in my dating life.

32:00.715 --> 32:02.874
Can you please find something
for him to focus on?

32:02.875 --> 32:04.425
I'm on it.

32:06.635 --> 32:07.905
Hey!

32:07.906 --> 32:08.850
You're Austin.

32:08.875 --> 32:10.025
Do I know you?

32:10.026 --> 32:10.874
Yeah, virtually.

32:10.875 --> 32:14.504
We were talking online about
your favorite assemblyman.

32:14.505 --> 32:16.424
I'm a friend of John Phillips.

32:16.425 --> 32:17.714
I... I got to go.

32:17.715 --> 32:19.294
Yeah, you could.

32:19.295 --> 32:21.331
You're a really good hacker, Austin.

32:21.356 --> 32:24.714
You hid your identity perfectly.

32:24.715 --> 32:26.544
All but once.

32:26.545 --> 32:29.635
When you donated to Karen
Phillip's memorial fund.

32:32.255 --> 32:35.044
It was supposed to be a dumb prank.

32:35.045 --> 32:37.794
I knew that Dormit would
be driving by that day.

32:37.795 --> 32:39.794
He'd been tweeting about
the fund-raiser all day.

32:39.795 --> 32:42.090
You... you really don't like the guy.

32:42.115 --> 32:44.334
My mom works at Bretner Library.

32:44.335 --> 32:47.214
Or she used to... until...

32:47.215 --> 32:48.544
Dormit demolished it to make room

32:48.545 --> 32:51.084
for that new highway
interchange off Exit 7.

32:51.085 --> 32:52.866
Dormit says, "Who cares?"

32:52.891 --> 32:55.254
Nobody reads books anymore anyways."

32:55.255 --> 32:57.544
So I thought I'd get back at him somehow.

32:57.545 --> 32:59.044
What did you do, Austin?

33:00.505 --> 33:01.584
What the hell is that?

33:01.585 --> 33:03.424
"No need to read"?

33:03.425 --> 33:05.924
We found this on Instagram.

33:05.925 --> 33:07.374
Austin hacked the sign.

33:07.375 --> 33:08.634
Somebody's gonna get fired.

33:08.635 --> 33:09.924
"No Need to Read"

33:09.925 --> 33:12.206
is just the hacker's stupid
joke for Dormit.

33:12.231 --> 33:14.417
It was there about 20
minutes before traffic

33:14.442 --> 33:16.097
clogged up enough to cause the accident.

33:16.122 --> 33:17.700
Once he realized what he had done,

33:17.701 --> 33:19.280
he switched it back.

33:19.281 --> 33:21.320
John, you really had no warning.

33:21.321 --> 33:23.570
This sign didn't say,
"Slow: Congestion ahead."

33:23.571 --> 33:25.629
This is it.

33:25.654 --> 33:27.490
This is the exact detail we needed,

33:27.491 --> 33:28.909
because Arthur's a rule-follower,

33:28.934 --> 33:30.200
and he'll know that our client

33:30.201 --> 33:31.660
did not break the rule.

33:31.661 --> 33:33.934
So we recall John back on stand?

33:35.991 --> 33:37.740
John?

33:37.741 --> 33:40.780
I can't do that.

33:40.781 --> 33:41.636
Why not?

33:41.637 --> 33:42.490
I...

33:42.491 --> 33:44.110
I don't think I ever saw the sign.

33:44.111 --> 33:45.490
I-I don't remember it.

33:45.491 --> 33:47.570
At all.

33:47.571 --> 33:51.530
If you don't remember
seeing it, so, the prosecution

33:51.531 --> 33:54.371
will say the hack doesn't matter.

33:56.396 --> 33:58.396
Recall John.

33:59.781 --> 34:02.950
Let 'em try.

34:02.951 --> 34:06.200
Isn't it odd,
Mr. Phillips, that you're just

34:06.201 --> 34:08.030
now remembering this hacked sign?

34:08.031 --> 34:11.409
It is, but so is being prosecuted

34:11.411 --> 34:13.178
for a car accident after losing my wife.

34:13.203 --> 34:14.610
After killing your wife, you mean.

34:14.610 --> 34:15.909
Objection!

34:15.911 --> 34:17.571
Sustained.

34:19.321 --> 34:20.699
Why didn't you tell us

34:20.701 --> 34:22.610
that the sign was hacked?

34:22.610 --> 34:24.531
Because you never saw it?

34:28.871 --> 34:30.820
The only one to watch is Arthur.

34:30.821 --> 34:33.553
So far, he's still with the prosecution.

34:33.578 --> 34:35.739
Bull knows what he's doing.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.370
Isn't there only one good
reason why you missed the sign?

34:38.371 --> 34:40.110
Isn't it because you were
driving under the influence?

34:40.110 --> 34:41.110
Objection!

34:41.112 --> 34:42.110
Overruled.

34:42.110 --> 34:44.530
You had a drink,
you were driving

34:44.531 --> 34:46.491
- in a fit of rage...
- That's not what happened.

34:46.494 --> 34:47.659
You were so angry that

34:47.661 --> 34:49.110
you couldn't think straight. Otherwise,

34:49.110 --> 34:51.110
you would have seen that giant
sign right in front of you,

34:51.110 --> 34:52.530
and Karen would still be alive,

34:52.531 --> 34:54.438
- wouldn't she?
- That's not true!

34:54.469 --> 34:55.280
Do you remember

34:55.281 --> 34:59.701
seeing the sign, hacked or not?

35:04.571 --> 35:06.570
No.

35:06.571 --> 35:08.700
I don't remember seeing it.

35:08.701 --> 35:12.451
Then it doesn't matter if
the sign was hacked.

35:20.781 --> 35:22.870
All right, this is the fun part.

35:22.871 --> 35:24.780
Right. The circus act.

35:24.781 --> 35:27.530
It's psychology, not a
parade of elephants.

35:27.531 --> 35:29.610
It's just the closing argument.

35:29.611 --> 35:31.320
You can do this.

35:31.321 --> 35:32.660
You want me

35:32.661 --> 35:34.570
to lure the jury into a trap.

35:34.571 --> 35:36.610
That's a little bit like a circus.

35:36.611 --> 35:38.780
Follow my lead.

35:38.781 --> 35:41.570
The prosecution argues that the
hacked sign doesn't matter...

35:41.571 --> 35:42.594
The prosecution argues that

35:42.618 --> 35:44.490
the hacked sign doesn't matter.

35:44.491 --> 35:45.490
Because John didn't see it.

35:45.491 --> 35:47.610
Because John didn't see it.

35:47.611 --> 35:50.280
And if he had seen it,
well, obviously,

35:50.281 --> 35:51.491
he would have remembered it.

35:52.439 --> 35:53.858
Right?

35:53.859 --> 35:55.898
Wrong.

35:55.899 --> 35:58.108
Our brains take in thousands of pieces

35:58.109 --> 36:01.568
of information every minute,
and our brains have to

36:01.569 --> 36:02.819
unconsciously make choices.

36:02.820 --> 36:04.068
Unconsciously make choices.

36:04.069 --> 36:06.479
- And we focus on what matters.
- We focus on what matters.

36:06.482 --> 36:10.568
A sign that says "No Need to Read"?

36:10.569 --> 36:12.358
Well, it doesn't matter.

36:12.359 --> 36:16.899
Still, I understand that maybe
you don't believe me.

36:18.439 --> 36:21.648
And I figured...
this is too important a detail

36:21.649 --> 36:24.188
to just take on faith.

36:24.189 --> 36:25.978
So this morning,

36:25.979 --> 36:29.608
I actually removed a
sign from this courtroom.

36:29.609 --> 36:31.648
It was big,

36:31.649 --> 36:34.318
and it was noticeable,

36:34.319 --> 36:36.028
and it's been on that wall

36:36.029 --> 36:38.608
for the entire length of this trial.

36:38.609 --> 36:43.569
So, can anyone tell me what it said?

36:44.609 --> 36:46.478
Nobody?

36:46.479 --> 36:49.399
How can you be sure
they won't remember?

36:51.569 --> 36:53.478
Okay, right. I should have learned

36:53.479 --> 36:56.068
to trust you and your witchcraft by now.

36:56.069 --> 36:57.609
It's not witchcraft.

36:58.569 --> 37:00.478
It's science.

37:00.479 --> 37:03.778
John read that road sign

37:03.779 --> 37:05.778
the way you all read that courtroom sign,

37:05.779 --> 37:08.568
but he dismissed it, just like you did,

37:08.569 --> 37:11.439
because it wasn't relevant.

37:13.149 --> 37:15.028
Just like this one.

37:15.029 --> 37:18.608
"A court officer must be
present at all times."

37:18.609 --> 37:20.778
Mr. Foster, I'd appreciate it

37:20.779 --> 37:23.478
if you would return my sign now.

37:23.479 --> 37:25.729
Of course, but this

37:25.754 --> 37:28.254
wasn't actually a sign
that was on the wall.

37:29.804 --> 37:31.133
This was.

37:31.158 --> 37:33.608
Objection. Clearly misleading the jury,

37:33.609 --> 37:34.569
Judge Bergen.

37:34.570 --> 37:37.507
That's my point, Mr. Mercado.
It's relevant to our case.

37:37.532 --> 37:40.924
Mr. Foster, put back the sign.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.715
Absolutely, Your Honor.

37:44.345 --> 37:45.714
The point is,

37:45.715 --> 37:47.674
- they weren't relevant.
- They weren't relevant.

37:47.675 --> 37:51.674
So you had no memory of seeing them,

37:51.675 --> 37:53.885
or not seeing them.

37:55.925 --> 37:57.514
Just...

37:57.515 --> 38:00.425
like... John.

38:05.265 --> 38:07.475
- And I can assure you,
- I can assure you,

38:07.478 --> 38:11.014
had that road sign said
something relevant,

38:11.015 --> 38:12.554
had it said, "Slow:".

38:12.555 --> 38:16.214
"Congestion ahead," well,

38:16.215 --> 38:19.805
John would have remembered
it, and reacted.

38:26.675 --> 38:29.135
- It would have saved Karen's.
- It would have saved Karen's

38:29.138 --> 38:30.675
life.

38:52.540 --> 38:55.422
This is 107.4
with your hourly news update.

38:55.447 --> 38:57.870
An acquittal today in the John
Phillips manslaughter case

38:57.871 --> 38:59.620
involving the death of his wife Karen.

38:59.621 --> 39:02.226
The case proceedings may have
opened up further legal action...

39:02.251 --> 39:06.628
Hey. I owe you... a lot.

39:07.251 --> 39:09.580
I told you, I'm already collecting
from Judge Lamkin.

39:09.581 --> 39:14.161
Now, there is one thing you,
you need to do.

39:15.676 --> 39:18.765
Just tell me I don't have to
reenact my fight with the coach.

39:18.790 --> 39:21.250
I'm not gonna make you do that.

39:21.251 --> 39:23.540
You just have to admit Karen was right.

39:23.541 --> 39:25.580
She knew the secret.

39:25.581 --> 39:29.870
Instead of hiding how Carter's
different, maybe it's better

39:29.871 --> 39:31.290
to embrace it.

39:31.291 --> 39:32.660
He doesn't have

39:32.661 --> 39:34.540
to hit home runs to be happy.

39:34.541 --> 39:36.790
That was Daddy's joy.

39:36.791 --> 39:38.290
He wants to make you proud.

39:38.291 --> 39:39.500
He doesn't have to.

39:39.501 --> 39:41.540
We know that, but does he?

39:41.541 --> 39:43.910
Dad!

39:43.911 --> 39:45.101
Hey. Did you see my stance?

39:45.102 --> 39:46.290
Yeah.

39:46.291 --> 39:48.290
Buddy, you looked great.

39:48.291 --> 39:50.056
So, what about this batter?

39:50.081 --> 39:51.181
What's his average?

39:51.206 --> 39:54.120
310, but his OBP is better.

39:54.121 --> 39:58.410
415 for home games,
and his slugging is 523.

39:58.411 --> 39:59.540
Awesome, right?

39:59.541 --> 40:01.250
Yeah. Covered in awesome sauce.

40:01.251 --> 40:02.620
All right, I'll see you later.

40:04.791 --> 40:07.410
So, what are the pitcher's stats?

40:07.411 --> 40:09.330
He's pretty good. I mean...

40:09.331 --> 40:10.541
- The batter?
- He's not a

40:10.544 --> 40:12.080
stick in the ground, either.

40:12.081 --> 40:14.000
Player over there looks pretty tough.

40:14.001 --> 40:15.660
That one's good.

40:19.211 --> 40:22.540
Here it comes. Yeah.

40:24.041 --> 40:26.120
You guys got pineapple again?

40:26.121 --> 40:28.620
Stop focusing on the details, Chunk.

40:28.621 --> 40:30.250
I could focus on the details

40:30.251 --> 40:31.540
if they weren't covered in pineapple.

40:31.541 --> 40:33.831
Ooh, hot! Ooh!

40:33.832 --> 40:35.661
There it is.

40:35.664 --> 40:38.450
Boo!

40:38.451 --> 40:41.750
So how's your ex-husband?

40:41.751 --> 40:44.251
It's tricky business,
rekindling with Greg.

40:44.254 --> 40:46.620
Who told you?

40:46.621 --> 40:48.450
You did.

40:48.451 --> 40:50.790
You wore three different
shades of green this week.

40:50.791 --> 40:52.750
That was his favorite color.

40:52.751 --> 40:56.338
Haven't worn green in a long time.

40:56.363 --> 40:58.620
I know it's probably a bad idea,

40:58.621 --> 41:00.710
and I promise I won't come to you again

41:00.711 --> 41:03.620
when things go south...

41:03.621 --> 41:06.830
You can always come to me.

41:06.831 --> 41:08.950
Thank you.

41:08.951 --> 41:10.120
Hey, guys, check this out.

41:10.121 --> 41:11.710
Have you seen this billboard?

41:14.411 --> 41:15.660
Judge Lamkin?

41:15.661 --> 41:17.869
She's running against
Dormit in the next election.

41:17.894 --> 41:18.697
That's amazing.

41:18.722 --> 41:19.750
- Awesome.
- Look at that.

41:19.751 --> 41:21.120
Wasn't that a
billboard for Dormit?

41:21.121 --> 41:23.710
Austin's not the
only hacker around here.
