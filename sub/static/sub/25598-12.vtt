WEBVTT

00:02.419 --> 00:04.797
I had a nightmare we made Louis managing partner.

00:04.797 --> 00:06.340
I couldn't get back to sleep.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.049
Wasn't a nightmare. You know it.

00:08.049 --> 00:11.512
I cannot let my clients down. It is just not in me.

00:11.512 --> 00:14.097
I just found us a new managing partner. I can handle

00:14.097 --> 00:16.642
finding Thomas Kessler a new general counsel.

00:16.642 --> 00:18.018
Now, the better question is,

00:18.018 --> 00:20.395
can you handle this job that you agreed to take?

00:20.395 --> 00:22.272
I was thinking about where we were a week ago,

00:22.272 --> 00:23.983
when I thought you were cold and heartless.

00:23.983 --> 00:25.776
I went from that to being your best friend.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.862
What's going on with Brian? He's married.

00:27.862 --> 00:30.238
I would never do-- I know. But the heart doesn't

00:30.238 --> 00:32.950
always listen to what the brain says it would never do.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.368
Finding you general counsel

00:34.368 --> 00:36.161
isn't about knowing your business.

00:36.161 --> 00:37.830
No. It's about chemistry.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.748
Yes, it is. How do you know my type?

00:39.748 --> 00:42.793
LOUIS: Life is gonna put that special

00:39.748 --> 00:42.793
someone in front of you.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.545
When it happens, you'll be ready.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.505
Truth is, I am running this place.

00:46.505 --> 00:48.340
We all need to get on board with that,

00:48.340 --> 00:50.885
and it starts with you reading me in.

00:50.885 --> 00:53.762
Have dinner with me. Thomas, I'm flattered,

00:53.762 --> 00:56.431
but you're a client, and-- <i>I'm gonna give you bit of time,</i>

00:56.431 --> 00:58.141
and if you still feel the same way,

00:58.141 --> 00:59.935
then I promise I will never ask again.

00:59.935 --> 01:01.937
<i>Fair?</i> Fair.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.406
GRETCHEN: Well?

01:13.782 --> 01:15.701
Well, what? Are you gonna say yes

01:15.701 --> 01:18.954
to your mystery man

01:18.954 --> 01:22.082
You think we didn't catch you looking at your phone all night?

01:22.082 --> 01:24.626
Those were work texts. Work texts don't use emojize.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.587
Emojis. Don't change the subject.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.423
The point is, you got a man who wants to go out with you.

01:29.423 --> 01:32.676
Gretchen, it's not just any man. It's Thomas Kessler.

01:32.676 --> 01:35.387
If you think Louis would object because he's a client--

01:35.387 --> 01:36.972
No, it's not just that. It's--

01:36.972 --> 01:39.391
Well, what is it? Because you clearly like him.

01:39.391 --> 01:42.436
So, what's stopping you from going out on a simple date

01:42.436 --> 01:45.355
and maybe getting your freak on?

01:46.648 --> 01:49.985
Nothing, Gretchen.

01:49.985 --> 01:52.279
Absolutely freaking nothing.

01:56.324 --> 01:59.078
Can I talk to you a second

01:59.078 --> 02:01.538
Well... I want to say

02:01.538 --> 02:04.458
I shouldn't have yelled at you and Robert about Malik.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.627
I should've heard you when you came to me,

02:06.627 --> 02:08.712
let you know how I was feeling. It's okay.

02:08.712 --> 02:11.339
I should've made you listen to me like Robert said.

02:11.339 --> 02:13.425
Well, I've been thinking,

02:13.425 --> 02:16.053
trying to be the best leader I can,

02:16.053 --> 02:18.973
and a good leader inspires people to do what they do best.

02:18.973 --> 02:21.349
And what you do best, Harvey, is close.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.684
Can't argue with you there.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.853
What do you say you land a big whale for us?

02:24.853 --> 02:26.313
I get it. You're a new captain.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.606
You wanna make a new statement.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.441
I want<i> us</i> to make a new statement.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.902
In that case, I did hear Steven Palmer is looking

02:31.902 --> 02:33.320
for new representation.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.572
Get that harpoon sharpened. I'll be expecting

02:35.572 --> 02:37.992
a nice piece of scrimshaw by the end of the week.

02:37.992 --> 02:40.243
What the hell is scrimshaw? Carved whale bone.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.913
What's the matter

02:42.913 --> 02:44.289
Not in the 1800s.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.792
Well, scrimshaw dates back to the mid-1700s--

02:46.792 --> 02:49.920
If you finish that sentence, no way I'm going after Palmer.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.255
Consider the sentence unfinished.

02:52.255 --> 02:53.674
Louis. Yeah.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.467
It takes a big man to come in here

02:55.467 --> 02:57.552
and say all that.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.554
I appreciate that.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.348
And...

03:01.348 --> 03:02.808
I'll get you your whale.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.269
Chips ahoy, Harvey.

03:09.397 --> 03:14.235
One decaf chai tea, three sugars.

03:14.235 --> 03:16.155
You're my associate, not my assistant.

03:16.155 --> 03:18.032
You don't have to bring me my beverage

03:18.032 --> 03:20.241
when I ask to see you. I can give it to Louis

03:20.241 --> 03:22.327
if you don't want. Give me that.

03:22.327 --> 03:26.040
And it just so happens I have something for you too.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.044
Katrina, I don't really wear women's--

03:30.044 --> 03:31.962
Chelsea Conner's Adored.

03:31.962 --> 03:35.049
As in Chelsea Conner, the makeup and fragrance giant.

03:35.049 --> 03:37.092
They're looking for representation.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.510
They reached out to me.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.721
They heard about our Hi-Rise Fashion victory.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.306
And now Chelsea wants us to go after a rival company

03:43.306 --> 03:45.642
who's copying their flagship fragrance.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.936
Brian, I think I might have found

03:47.936 --> 03:49.021
my partner specialty.

03:49.021 --> 03:50.939
Consumer goods.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.941
It's not as sexy or exciting as tax law,

03:52.941 --> 03:54.568
but let's face it, what is?

03:54.568 --> 03:56.236
You don't get out much, do you?

03:56.236 --> 03:57.779
Heh. You know what I mean.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.823
I do. What do you need me to do?

03:59.823 --> 04:01.533
Find out everything there is to know

04:01.533 --> 04:02.910
about our product and theirs,

04:02.910 --> 04:04.912
and figure out a way to shut them down.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.538
Consider it done.

04:06.538 --> 04:07.789
And, hey, for the record,

04:07.789 --> 04:10.542
this is your victory as much as mine.

04:11.292 --> 04:12.961
Thanks, Katrina.

04:20.468 --> 04:21.887
It's got pretty good speed

04:21.887 --> 04:24.806
for something that runs on plants.

04:24.806 --> 04:28.018
That particular vehicle runs on 91 unleaded.

04:28.018 --> 04:30.478
But you're gonna make one like it that doesn't.

04:30.478 --> 04:32.647
You're more interested in changing the world

04:32.647 --> 04:34.900
than in making money. For a guy I've never met,

04:34.900 --> 04:36.610
you know a lot about my business.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.279
I make it my business to know a lot about my clients.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.572
Harvey Specter.

04:40.572 --> 04:42.657
I take it you heard I'm on the market.

04:42.657 --> 04:45.452
I've heard you're looking for a guy to kill it for you.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.913
And you think you're that guy. Well, I know I am.

04:47.913 --> 04:49.330
People said you were cocky.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.041
People said I was confident.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.252
And I am. But only because I can back it up.

04:53.252 --> 04:56.171
But I'm afraid you wasted your trip.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.173
Because I'm not signing with you.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.259
Why not? You have a reputation.

05:00.259 --> 05:03.178
My reputation is being the best closer in the city.

05:03.178 --> 05:05.388
Which is exactly why you should sign with me.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.724
It's also that you never do what you're told.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.559
And I may consider myself a maverick,

05:09.559 --> 05:11.436
but I don't want my lawyer to be one.

05:11.436 --> 05:12.980
Steven-- Harvey, I just said no,

05:12.980 --> 05:15.190
and the reason is that you don't listen.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.276
So if you even want a shot at my business,

05:17.276 --> 05:19.027
your best chance of changing my mind

05:19.027 --> 05:21.488
would be to turn around and let me be.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.285
What do you say to that?

05:26.285 --> 05:29.121
Hell of a car, Steven.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.832
Hell of a car.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.036
The answer is yes.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.662
Uh, yes to what?

06:10.662 --> 06:12.706
Yes to the question that you asked me.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.959
You're gonna have to forgive me, but which question was that?

06:15.959 --> 06:19.129
I'm a very curious person. I ask a lot of questions.

06:19.129 --> 06:22.632
Okay, I get it. You wanna hear me say the words,

06:22.632 --> 06:25.384
"Yes, I will go out with you." I might have.

06:25.384 --> 06:27.179
Well, I just did. THOMAS:<i> Good.</i>

06:27.179 --> 06:29.973
<i>In that case, the answer</i> <i>to your question is also yes.</i>

06:29.973 --> 06:31.432
I didn't ask you a question.

06:31.432 --> 06:33.518
You were gonna ask if I made reservations.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.312
And yes, I already made some.

06:35.312 --> 06:36.646
How could you know that?

06:36.646 --> 06:38.982
Well, one, I'm an optimist.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.776
And two, I know you've spent your entire career

06:41.776 --> 06:43.237
making plans for other people,

06:43.237 --> 06:45.030
and I thought you might appreciate

06:45.030 --> 06:46.573
<i>someone making plans for you.</i>

06:46.573 --> 06:49.284
Yeah, I would. <i>Here's what I want you to do.</i>

06:49.284 --> 06:51.912
<i>Be ready for me to pick you up</i> <i>tomorrow night at 7.</i>

06:51.912 --> 06:56.415
Wear something stunning and hope to God I show up.

06:56.415 --> 06:58.335
Done.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.712
And, Thomas,

07:00.712 --> 07:02.672
why did you wanna hear me say it?

07:02.672 --> 07:07.302
Because I may be an optimist, but it's still nice to hear.

07:08.427 --> 07:10.680
I'll see you tomorrow night, then.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.516
And then he tried to tell me he was right.

07:13.516 --> 07:16.311
The man shows up 30 minutes late to our date,

07:16.311 --> 07:19.231
and I'm hearing some bullshit about<i> Johnson v. Florida.</i>

07:19.231 --> 07:21.149
He didn't. Hey, that's what she gets

07:21.149 --> 07:24.194
for dating a law student. No. I was also a law student.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.863
I still managed to communicate like a human being.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.157
My skills have gotten a lot better since then.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.242
SAMANTHA: Oh, really?

07:30.242 --> 07:31.451
How are his "I'm sorrys,"

07:31.451 --> 07:32.911
and "You were right, honeys"?

07:32.911 --> 07:34.371
How do you think they are?

07:34.371 --> 07:36.581
I'm starting to think this was a bad idea.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.833
To be honest, I was surprised you suggested it.

07:38.833 --> 07:42.045
Well, the truth is, Alex didn't suggest it.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.755
I did. Well, now, I'm curious.

07:43.755 --> 07:46.300
ALEX: Rosalie figured

07:43.755 --> 07:46.300
we'd just been through a war.

07:46.300 --> 07:49.052
What better way to start fresh than by breaking bread?

07:49.052 --> 07:51.512
You've already met Joy. This couldn't go any worse.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.932
Clearly, I was wrong.

07:53.932 --> 07:56.017
Well, there is another reason

07:56.017 --> 07:58.019
I wanted to sit down and have lunch.

07:58.019 --> 07:59.938
After I had my babies,

07:59.938 --> 08:03.275
I left my law firm, and I wanted to raise them.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.277
But they are older now,

08:05.277 --> 08:07.404
and it's time to get back in the game.

08:07.404 --> 08:08.947
Wait a second.

08:08.947 --> 08:10.115
Is this about your case? It is.

08:11.283 --> 08:12.575
I've got dozens of graduates

08:12.575 --> 08:14.369
that went to a worthless university.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.997
They got a worthless degree, and now they're in debt.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.166
And you could use a little help with it.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.583
Yes. Yes, I could.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.169
Rosalie, we didn't talk about--

08:22.169 --> 08:24.963
Quiet, Alex. Your wife and I are talking.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.466
What kind of help do you need?

08:27.466 --> 08:30.260
Robert Zane. Just the man I was looking to see.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.512
Whatever it is, I have a tee time in an hour.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.555
Well, that's okay. This won't take long.

08:34.555 --> 08:37.684
Are those my walking papers? <i>Rigoletto</i> tickets.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.644
Best in the house. I know Laura's a fan.

08:39.644 --> 08:41.480
I wish these were my walking papers.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.981
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to--

08:42.981 --> 08:45.608
I'm just kidding. This is a wonderful gesture.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.277
You mind if I ask what it's for?

08:47.277 --> 08:50.071
I know it couldn't have been easy stepping down for me.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.948
I wanted to show you I appreciate it.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.492
Thank you. This means a lot.

08:53.492 --> 08:55.994
Louis. Gretchen texted you wanted to see me.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.954
I wanted to see how it went with Steven.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.580
I got him on the one-yard line.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.500
English. You know I don't know baseball.

09:01.500 --> 09:03.460
In that case, the fat lady's singing.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.420
Music to my ears. Should I lob in a call

09:05.420 --> 09:07.464
to get her to wrap it up? Not necessary.

09:07.464 --> 09:08.882
I got it.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.842
You're all over it. I won't push.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.844
Robert, enjoy the tix. Gentlemen.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.930
Fat lady singing, my ass.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.349
Excuse me?

09:17.349 --> 09:19.642
The only one-yard line you're on is your own.

09:19.642 --> 09:22.396
How do you know that? Easier to tell someone's lying

09:22.396 --> 09:24.314
when they're lying to someone else.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.525
For your information, I'm not really lying.

09:26.525 --> 09:28.235
It doesn't matter what yard line,

09:28.235 --> 09:29.610
I'm landing this guy.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.696
I am glad I'm not managing you anymore.

09:31.696 --> 09:34.241
That is some prime-cut Harvey Specter bullshit.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.825
Speaking of fat ladies.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.494
You want these opera tickets?

09:37.494 --> 09:40.497
No way I'm letting Laura drag me to another snoozefest.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.623
I don't really-- That's a good man.

09:46.627 --> 09:49.548
I have to say, I really think you married up.

09:49.548 --> 09:51.508
Yeah. I've been saying that for years.

09:51.508 --> 09:54.344
But right now, I need to say something else.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.637
I don't want you taking that case with Rosalie.

09:56.637 --> 09:58.806
Yeah, you made that pretty clear at lunch.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.016
Question is, why not?

10:00.016 --> 10:01.809
You want me to list all the reasons?

10:01.809 --> 10:03.478
Come on, Rosalie said it herself.

10:03.478 --> 10:05.146
We just went to war. And I know you know

10:05.146 --> 10:06.814
what happened

10:06.814 --> 10:08.400
between me and Katrina.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.527
We need something to bring us together.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.362
Then let's have a bake sale.

10:12.362 --> 10:15.532
There's a reason she and I don't mix work and our relationship.

10:15.532 --> 10:18.577
I already told her I'd help. I'm not gonna break my word.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.203
Then I wanna be clear right now.

10:20.203 --> 10:22.663
I don't care what happens, you leave me out of it.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.874
You're strong women who have strong opinions

10:24.874 --> 10:27.544
about anything. I don't wanna be in the middle.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.379
As far as I am concerned,

10:29.379 --> 10:31.631
you will never hear one word about this from me.

10:35.218 --> 10:37.011
Linda Janowitz. I'm Katrina Bennett.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.221
This is Brian Altman.

10:38.221 --> 10:40.056
We're here on behalf of Chelsea Conner.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.891
In that case, this should be short.

10:41.891 --> 10:43.810
If you'd prefer a long court fight,

10:43.810 --> 10:47.314
that can be arranged. Actually, it's been arranged.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.941
You're trying to shut me down? This is a joke.

10:49.941 --> 10:52.486
I don't think you'll be laughing when a court orders

10:52.486 --> 10:55.489
you to close your doors. Why would they do that?

10:55.489 --> 10:58.408
Because, as you're well aware, there's a 97 percent overlap

10:58.408 --> 11:00.743
between the packaging of your product and Adored.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.954
It's not because we're copying your product.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.623
We can prove it. Bullshit.

11:04.623 --> 11:07.375
Is it? We market-tested every aspect of our packaging.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.709
Based on our focus groups,

11:08.709 --> 11:10.253
the color that women found

11:10.253 --> 11:11.796
most appealing was red.

11:11.796 --> 11:14.090
They also responded to cursive lettering

11:14.090 --> 11:16.759
and gold foil trim. So that's what we gave them.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.803
What you gave them is a carbon copy

11:18.803 --> 11:20.430
of my client's flagship product.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.890
As for focus groups, the best one I know is a jury.

11:22.890 --> 11:24.559
KATRINA: So pull your product,

11:24.559 --> 11:25.852
repackage with a new name,

11:25.852 --> 11:27.604
and that lawsuit never gets filed.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.814
Except for one thing. There's no way

11:29.814 --> 11:31.983
you prove our product is a knockoff of yours

11:31.983 --> 11:34.861
when, among other things, they smell completely different.

11:34.861 --> 11:38.615
Which anyone who takes one whiff of them can tell.

11:42.910 --> 11:44.996
Hello. LOUIS:<i> Steven. Louis Litt.</i>

11:44.996 --> 11:47.081
Zane Specter Litt. Now a good time?

11:47.081 --> 11:49.083
You must have gotten your wires crossed.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.252
Your firm paid me a visit. LOUIS:<i> I know.</i>

11:51.252 --> 11:53.004
I know Harvey has you well in hand.

11:53.004 --> 11:55.590
I wanted to tell you how much we value your business.

11:55.590 --> 11:57.842
Value my business? You don't have my business.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.427
I know it's not official yet.

11:59.427 --> 12:01.638
PALMER: <i>Let me tell you</i>

11:59.427 --> 12:01.638
<i>what I told Harvey.</i>

12:01.638 --> 12:04.974
I am not interested in your firm representing me.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.101
I see.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.187
Do you mind if I ask why not?

12:09.187 --> 12:11.730
I'll tell you what I told him. He has a reputation

12:11.730 --> 12:15.318
for not doing what he's told. Well, I can't argue with that.

12:15.318 --> 12:17.404
But I do not have that reputation.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.198
I've become managing partner. If you'll give me a chance

12:20.198 --> 12:22.617
<i>to sit down with you</i>

12:22.617 --> 12:25.286
I'm having a charity poker event tonight.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.039
In that case-- Before you answer,

12:28.039 --> 12:29.708
it'll cost you $100,000.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.669
<i>So if you're willing to part</i> <i>with that amount of money,</i>

12:32.669 --> 12:34.962
I'll see you there. But I have to tell you,

12:34.962 --> 12:37.674
if you can't tell when Harvey Specter's playing you,

12:37.674 --> 12:40.093
I'm not sure it'll be worth your time.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.139
Anything? I've been thinking about it.

12:45.139 --> 12:48.017
Without proof they're lying, we've no way to make our case.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.687
Shit. Katrina, we can still back out.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.690
No. We back out, Chelsea's brand is going to mean nothing.

12:53.690 --> 12:55.149
Not to mention my specialty

12:55.149 --> 12:57.151
goes out the window. What are we gonna do?

12:57.151 --> 13:00.029
We have to get Linda Janowitz to break in a deposition.

13:00.029 --> 13:03.782
Which isn't going to be easy because we have no evidence.

13:03.782 --> 13:05.493
Wait a second. Maybe we do.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.496
What do you mean? They lied about the packaging.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.832
What's to say they aren't lying about the perfumes themselves?

13:11.832 --> 13:13.209
Oh, my God. You're right.

13:13.209 --> 13:16.045
They might smell exactly alike.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.215
I can't tell if they smell different.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.342
That's because you're smelling them wrong.

13:21.342 --> 13:22.594
Here.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.018
Try it now.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.857
Keep your eyes closed.

13:36.857 --> 13:38.067
It focuses your senses.

13:56.835 --> 13:57.920
Brian.

14:03.677 --> 14:04.843
Yeah.

14:04.843 --> 14:06.304
What do you think?

14:07.263 --> 14:08.515
They're different.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.184
Well, perfume is a personal thing.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.478
It has to do with how it interacts

14:13.478 --> 14:16.690
with a person's skin and pheromones.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.734
It's a personal thing.

14:19.734 --> 14:21.569
Yeah.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.321
Personal.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.951
Looks like our work is cut out for us.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.411
We have to drop everything

14:30.411 --> 14:32.413
and focus on this. I can't.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.248
What do you mean? I'm your associate,

14:34.248 --> 14:36.668
but I've been on the Hardwick team for six months.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.294
Tonight is our final doc review.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.421
Well, there are other people on that team.

14:40.421 --> 14:41.881
I don't have anyone else.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.883
What does that mean?

14:43.883 --> 14:46.010
It means I'm gonna get you out of it.

14:49.848 --> 14:53.309
I've gotta say, this is an impressive operation

14:53.309 --> 14:54.935
you've got your name on.

14:54.935 --> 14:57.188
Well, there's a reason Alex and I went to war.

14:57.188 --> 14:58.606
I can't believe this is the first time

14:58.606 --> 15:00.650
you're seeing the offices. It's not.

15:00.650 --> 15:03.444
It's the first time I'm looking at it through new eyes.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.613
What kind of eyes? The kind that are looking

15:05.613 --> 15:07.323
to intimidate. I'm listening.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.659
I've got a bunch of victims

15:09.659 --> 15:12.746
who were promised the moon and the stars,

15:12.746 --> 15:14.581
a job placement rate close to zero,

15:14.581 --> 15:15.956
and an administration

15:15.956 --> 15:18.167
that claims those promises were never made.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.336
In other words, they're lying. Yes.

15:20.336 --> 15:23.673
But I need an office like this and a partner like you

15:23.673 --> 15:25.550
to get him to admit what he knows.

15:25.550 --> 15:26.801
And then?

15:26.801 --> 15:28.636
Even if he breaks at deposition,

15:28.636 --> 15:30.471
we can only commit so much man power.

15:30.471 --> 15:33.099
I'm not looking to go to trial. I'm looking to close

15:33.099 --> 15:35.518
in the room. How are you gonna do that?

15:35.518 --> 15:38.646
I was thinking something like this.

15:42.483 --> 15:46.195
I like you more and more. Let's get something on the books.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.823
These clowns are not gonna know what hit them.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.745
If you're here to suggest we go out for drinks again,

15:53.745 --> 15:56.497
I would love to, but it just so happens that I'm--

15:56.497 --> 15:58.416
That's not why I'm here. I need you to

15:58.416 --> 16:00.835
clear Brian's schedule tonight. Before you say--

16:00.835 --> 16:02.712
Okay, I'll take care of it.

16:02.712 --> 16:03.922
He's all yours.

16:03.922 --> 16:06.382
That's it? You're not going to tell me

16:06.382 --> 16:08.259
he's been working on the Hardwick case?

16:08.259 --> 16:09.844
You can't just pull him off now?

16:09.844 --> 16:11.721
No. Why would I tell you that?

16:11.721 --> 16:15.391
And why do you look like you want me to tell you that?

16:15.391 --> 16:18.185
Katrina, what's going on?

16:18.185 --> 16:21.439
Brian and I had...a moment.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.232
A "moment" moment? Yes.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.859
Donna...

16:26.110 --> 16:28.738
...a "moment" moment.

16:28.738 --> 16:32.074
Okay. I don't want this to come off wrong,

16:32.074 --> 16:36.078
but did you share a moment or did just you have a moment?

16:36.078 --> 16:38.623
<i>We</i> had a moment, Donna.

16:38.623 --> 16:42.710
And nothing happened, but it was 100 percent a moment.

16:42.710 --> 16:45.087
But I need his help on this case.

16:45.087 --> 16:46.506
He's my associate.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.591
I can't hide from him the rest of my life.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.301
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

16:50.301 --> 16:52.261
No, I'm not.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.722
Then I just have one piece of advice.

16:54.722 --> 16:57.892
If you don't wanna eat a cookie, stay out of the kitchen.

17:03.105 --> 17:04.816
Louis. How's it going? Nice weather.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.233
Mind telling me why you lied

17:06.233 --> 17:07.777
about Steven Palmer? Listen.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.195
No. I talked to him, Harvey.

17:09.195 --> 17:11.030
Before you lie again-- I didn't.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.783
I told you I had him, and I do. Then why did he tell me

17:13.783 --> 17:16.870
he wants nothing to do with you? That's what all the girls say.

17:16.870 --> 17:19.288
That's exactly what he's talking about.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.331
You don't listen.

17:20.331 --> 17:22.041
I don't what? You heard me.

17:22.041 --> 17:24.126
You didn't listen. I was when you said

17:24.126 --> 17:27.463
you weren't gonna call him. I said I wasn't gonna push.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.423
And I didn't. What I did was determine

17:29.423 --> 17:31.509
that I can't trust you. I'm taking over.

17:31.509 --> 17:32.719
The hell you are.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.261
I heard him loud and clear.

17:34.261 --> 17:36.014
He wanted me to show him that I respect him.

17:36.014 --> 17:37.640
That's what I'm gonna do tonight.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.392
Oh, right. At his poker game.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.768
There's a change of plans.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.395
Zane Specter Litt is still going,

17:42.395 --> 17:44.438
but Litt's gonna be the one at the table.

17:44.438 --> 17:47.191
You go to that game, all you're gonna do is show Palmer

17:47.191 --> 17:48.693
you don't know shit about poker.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.611
You go there, all you're gonna prove is

17:50.611 --> 17:52.739
all you care about is yourself.

17:52.739 --> 17:55.449
Prove us both wrong and do as you're told for a change.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.618
Back off my client. I'm not backing off.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.871
There's no negotiation, Harvey.

17:59.871 --> 18:01.706
You stay away from that game tonight.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.791
Your services are no longer needed.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.177
Louis. Steven.

18:15.177 --> 18:19.223
I didn't think you'd put your money where your mouth is.

18:19.223 --> 18:22.184
I hope tonight shows that when I make a promise, I keep it.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.603
A potential client.

18:23.603 --> 18:24.854
But I'll tell you what.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.439
If you can take my money tonight,

18:26.439 --> 18:28.315
you'll be much closer to signing me.

18:28.315 --> 18:31.151
Why don't we just have a seat? HARVEY: Don't mind if I do.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.780
What are you doing here? I was in the neighborhood.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.323
I had an extra hundred thou in my pocket.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.825
And I thought to myself,

18:37.825 --> 18:40.078
"Why not show you gentlemen how to play cards?"

18:40.078 --> 18:41.788
You think you can take my money?

18:41.788 --> 18:44.624
I don't know. But I'm sure Louis can't.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.208
You don't mind, do you, Louis?

18:46.208 --> 18:48.753
No, of course not, I don't mind at all.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.510
Katrina, I've been looking all over--

18:56.510 --> 18:58.846
Before you say anything, I got you off Hardwick.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.514
Instead of working in the library,

19:00.514 --> 19:02.100
we should work in the bullpen.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.226
It's much-- I can't work tonight at all.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.562
What? I told you I got you out. It's not that.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.231
Julie's out of town, and we just lost our babysitter.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.651
Are you kidding? We need to do this tonight.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.028
I know, I'm sorry. But she just got sick, I--

19:14.028 --> 19:16.614
I get it. It's not your fault. I just need your help.

19:16.614 --> 19:19.826
Okay, look. I know it's not...ideal,

19:19.826 --> 19:22.662
but we could work at my place tonight.

19:22.662 --> 19:25.665
Your place? I don't know what else to do.

19:25.665 --> 19:30.294
Okay, but we need to focus. Absolutely. One hundred percent.

19:30.294 --> 19:33.297
All business. Once he goes down, he sleeps through the night.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.925
We work straight through. What time should I be there?

19:35.925 --> 19:37.844
Eight o'clock. Want me to order food?

19:37.844 --> 19:40.471
No, it's best if we've both eaten before I get there.

19:40.471 --> 19:42.222
I couldn't agree more.

19:43.975 --> 19:46.519
Raise 10,000. You're bluffing.

19:46.519 --> 19:49.147
Oh, that's what he does, Steven. Not me.

19:49.147 --> 19:50.481
Call.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.275
I don't care whether either of you

19:53.275 --> 19:55.569
are bluffing or not, because...

19:55.569 --> 19:56.863
I have a flush.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.072
Oh, shit.

19:58.072 --> 19:59.448
Whoa, not so fast, Steven.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.367
I just happen to have a few queens

20:01.367 --> 20:02.994
reigning over a couple of tens.

20:02.994 --> 20:05.538
That's bullshit. You beat me on the river.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.999
You had a 4 percent chance of having a flush.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.500
Pot odds were in my favor.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.336
River or not, I made the right call.

20:12.336 --> 20:15.464
I made the right call. I need a drink.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.842
Louis, can I talk to you

20:17.842 --> 20:19.886
That I'm beating your ass in a game

20:19.886 --> 20:21.595
you didn't think I knew how to play?

20:21.595 --> 20:23.430
You don't know how to play it, Louis.

20:23.430 --> 20:24.891
Poker's about playing the man.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.767
Guys like Palmer don't like to lose.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.477
You don't give a shit about Palmer.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.646
You're just mad that I beat you. Beat me?

20:30.646 --> 20:33.315
I just had a four of a kind. But I laid it down,

20:33.315 --> 20:35.234
like I've been laying down all night.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.569
I'm trying to let him win.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.696
Bullshit. You don't let anybody win.

20:38.696 --> 20:41.323
I do when I need them to know I can bend a knee.

20:41.323 --> 20:43.117
Then why didn't you bend a knee to me

20:43.117 --> 20:44.785
by not coming here like I asked?

20:44.785 --> 20:46.579
You didn't ask, you ordered.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.832
What you asked was for me to close this guy

20:49.832 --> 20:51.542
because I'm better at it than you.

20:51.542 --> 20:54.128
You were gonna throw a game he didn't know you threw

20:54.128 --> 20:55.922
just to prove you can bend a knee?

20:55.922 --> 20:58.216
He'd know it in his heart. He'd appreciate it.

20:58.216 --> 21:01.010
I say it out loud, it humiliates him like you're doing.

21:01.010 --> 21:03.012
No. The person I'm humiliating is you.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.098
I'm closing the client, taking your money,

21:05.098 --> 21:07.058
and you can't stand me doing either one.

21:07.058 --> 21:09.143
If that's what you think, let's get it on.

21:09.143 --> 21:11.270
As of this minute, I don't give a shit

21:11.270 --> 21:12.521
if we land this guy or not.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.028
Hey. How did it go today?

21:19.028 --> 21:21.405
I thought you said you didn't wanna be involved.

21:21.405 --> 21:24.075
I don't wanna be involved. I didn't say I don't care.

21:24.075 --> 21:26.869
In that case, it went well. She's good, Alex.

21:26.869 --> 21:29.538
I know she is. Then I have to ask.

21:29.538 --> 21:31.249
Why don't you wanna work with her?

21:31.249 --> 21:34.293
All right. The truth?

21:34.293 --> 21:35.669
Rosalie thinks I think

21:35.669 --> 21:37.546
I'm a better lawyer than her. Do you?

21:37.546 --> 21:39.882
I wouldn't have married her if I thought that.

21:39.882 --> 21:42.426
Then why does she think it?

21:42.426 --> 21:44.220
We did work together once.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.055
Back in law school. Mock trial?

21:46.055 --> 21:48.933
Pro bono. Something we both cared about.

21:48.933 --> 21:52.145
The case hit a roadblock. Rosalie suggested one strategy.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.479
I suggested a different one.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.606
We ended up getting in a huge fight.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.399
Actually broke us up for a while.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.485
You got back together. We loved each other.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.862
But we also knew if that could happen once...

22:01.862 --> 22:03.823
There's a chance it could happen again.

22:03.823 --> 22:07.034
Which is why I'm asking you how it went instead of asking her.

22:07.034 --> 22:10.204
If it makes you feel any better, the case is in good hands.

22:10.204 --> 22:12.206
And the more I get to know you,

22:12.206 --> 22:14.959
I'd say your marriage is in good hands.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.460
Night, Samantha.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.045
Good night, Alex.

22:19.255 --> 22:21.715
Okay, Harvey. Just you and me now.

22:21.715 --> 22:24.426
Tell you the truth, Louis,

22:24.426 --> 22:26.512
I'm impressed that you lasted this long.

22:26.512 --> 22:29.223
So take your participation trophy and go home.

22:29.223 --> 22:31.642
Only thing I'll be going home with is your money.

22:31.642 --> 22:33.227
You always fight like this?

22:33.227 --> 22:35.938
Think of it this way. If I fight like this at the table,

22:35.938 --> 22:37.773
imagine how I fight in a courtroom.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.483
Please. Don't listen to him.

22:39.483 --> 22:42.611
Only thing Harvey fights hardest for is himself. Raise 50,000.

22:42.611 --> 22:45.323
Fifty isn't enough. I'm all in.

22:46.740 --> 22:49.367
Now, Louis, before you decide how to play the hand

22:49.367 --> 22:50.828
that could clean you out,

22:50.828 --> 22:53.747
I want you to think of our entire history.

22:53.747 --> 22:56.292
Of me always winning, and you always losing.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.128
And when you're finished doing that,

22:59.128 --> 23:01.421
you'll realize it doesn't matter what you do.

23:01.421 --> 23:03.090
Because whatever it is,

23:03.090 --> 23:04.675
it's gonna be the wrong decision.

23:20.191 --> 23:22.151
I fold. See? That's exactly

23:22.151 --> 23:23.527
what I was talking about.

23:23.527 --> 23:26.322
All I had was ten high.

23:28.115 --> 23:29.867
Not only did you lose,

23:29.867 --> 23:32.703
but you have to sit here on tilt for the rest of the night

23:32.703 --> 23:34.538
while I take the rest of your money.

23:34.538 --> 23:35.789
Because like I said,

23:35.789 --> 23:38.667
poker isn't about playing the odds.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.086
It's about playing the man.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.713
I have to say, that was impressive.

23:42.713 --> 23:45.049
Well, Steven, I didn't beat him to impress you.

23:45.049 --> 23:47.718
I beat him because that's what I do.

23:47.718 --> 23:49.053
I don't follow orders.

23:49.053 --> 23:51.013
I don't bend a knee. I win.

23:51.013 --> 23:54.392
So if that's the kind of lawyer you want, good luck.

23:54.392 --> 23:57.895
Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got Louis' money to take.

24:02.233 --> 24:04.568
Shit. That woman was telling the truth.

24:04.568 --> 24:07.238
According to Chelsea Conner's own focus group,

24:07.238 --> 24:10.074
consumers like red, cursive fonts--

24:10.074 --> 24:11.700
BRIAN: In gold foiled trim.

24:11.700 --> 24:14.578
Which means we've officially got gold-foiled nothing.

24:14.578 --> 24:16.538
Give me the knockoff group results again.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.498
Which one

24:18.498 --> 24:20.667
They did, like, two dozen. Wait a second.

24:20.667 --> 24:22.962
How many focus groups did we do? Five.

24:22.962 --> 24:26.673
Five versus 24

24:26.673 --> 24:28.259
If you're thinking the only time

24:28.259 --> 24:30.219
someone does that many focus groups

24:30.219 --> 24:33.264
is when they're trying to rig the results, then yes, I am.

24:33.264 --> 24:34.974
If we know what we're looking for,

24:34.974 --> 24:36.309
we know what to do.

24:36.309 --> 24:38.269
Which means our work here is done.

24:39.812 --> 24:42.106
What? It doesn't matter where we work.

24:42.106 --> 24:43.565
We make a great team.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.360
That we do.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.529
Great job tonight, Brian.

24:49.529 --> 24:52.408
Good focus, effort.

24:52.408 --> 24:54.118
Got the job done.

24:54.118 --> 24:56.078
Hey.

24:56.078 --> 24:58.331
Just in time.

25:01.917 --> 25:03.585
Hey, buddy.

25:05.004 --> 25:08.715
Looks like someone wants to say hello.

25:08.715 --> 25:11.260
That's okay. I can say hello from here.

25:11.260 --> 25:14.388
You've never held a baby, have you?

25:14.388 --> 25:17.308
Heh. I've-- I've held millions of babies.

25:17.308 --> 25:20.102
I guess you won't mind holding one more.

25:20.102 --> 25:21.645
Okay.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.857
How do I do it?

25:24.857 --> 25:26.692
Here.

25:26.692 --> 25:29.611
You just take him in your arms.

25:29.611 --> 25:31.489
Like this.

25:31.489 --> 25:33.115
Yeah.

25:42.749 --> 25:45.252
I have to go.

25:55.553 --> 25:57.515
SAMANTHA: Mr. DiBiase, can you explain

25:57.515 --> 25:59.392
why people pay up to $25,000 a year

25:59.392 --> 26:00.934
to go to your college?

26:00.934 --> 26:03.687
Why does anyone go to college? Make their lives better.

26:03.687 --> 26:06.899
And you promised their lives will be better by using lies.

26:06.899 --> 26:10.236
We help our students invest in their future.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.154
By taking on a mountain of debt in loans

26:12.154 --> 26:14.865
which your college profits from, and you personally.

26:14.865 --> 26:17.117
That is not true. SAMANTHA: Isn't it?

26:17.117 --> 26:20.913
Half your pay is tied to loan origination, correct?

26:20.913 --> 26:23.916
That doesn't mean that I profit from the loans.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.960
It means that it doesn't matter whether students find jobs,

26:26.960 --> 26:28.879
as long as bodies keep coming,

26:28.879 --> 26:30.588
signing their lives away with debt.

26:30.588 --> 26:32.341
You're paid to say whatever it takes

26:32.341 --> 26:34.634
to make that happen, aren't you? Don't answer.

26:34.634 --> 26:36.136
SAMANTHA: I'll answer for you.

26:36.136 --> 26:37.346
You are paid to do that.

26:37.346 --> 26:38.889
And once we prove that,

26:38.889 --> 26:41.808
we can come after you personally.

26:41.808 --> 26:43.519
Is that true?

26:43.519 --> 26:45.896
No. And even if they do, we'll indemnify you.

26:45.896 --> 26:49.233
So it's not true, but it might be true?

26:49.233 --> 26:52.445
Who do you think she's looking out for

26:52.445 --> 26:55.655
They're gonna say you lied to inflate your compensation.

26:55.655 --> 26:58.700
They're gonna hang you out to dry and wipe their hands clean.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.827
SAMANTHA: This is your

26:58.700 --> 27:00.827
one and only chance.

27:00.827 --> 27:02.788
Because now we will waive your liability.

27:02.788 --> 27:05.916
You know what? We're done here.

27:07.126 --> 27:08.877
I lied about the numbers.

27:08.877 --> 27:13.173
And did the board of directors instruct you to tell those lies?

27:13.173 --> 27:15.633
DiBIASE: They did. We'll accept a settlement

27:15.633 --> 27:17.177
of $50,000 per plaintiff.

27:17.177 --> 27:19.721
Fifteen thousand, the best you're gonna get.

27:19.721 --> 27:22.516
The best we're gonna get is if we play that tape in court

27:22.516 --> 27:24.226
and a jury is gonna give us 100,000.

27:24.226 --> 27:27.104
If they do, you won't even get 15. We'll be bankrupt.

27:27.104 --> 27:30.232
And if you don't believe me, I'll send our books to prove it.

27:35.653 --> 27:38.574
Good, you're still here. I'm leaving early. I have plans.

27:38.574 --> 27:40.993
The only plans you have is to stay and help me.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.537
Okay, Louis, if you want my help,

27:43.537 --> 27:45.205
I'd start with what's so important.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.915
As usual, Harvey's out of control.

27:46.915 --> 27:48.792
He lied about landing Steven Palmer,

27:48.792 --> 27:51.629
then he defies me by showing up to his card game.

27:51.629 --> 27:53.297
Then he proceeds to humiliate me

27:53.297 --> 27:55.966
and a potential client. And what do you want me to do?

27:55.966 --> 27:58.135
Do for me what I know you did for Thomas.

27:58.135 --> 27:59.637
What? Match make, Donna.

27:59.637 --> 28:01.763
Stay here to find me the perfect whale

28:01.763 --> 28:04.224
so I can prove I close just as well as Harvey can.

28:04.224 --> 28:06.768
Louis, I'm sorry you're in this situation,

28:06.768 --> 28:09.480
and I would be happy to help you at any other time,

28:09.480 --> 28:11.940
but not tonight. Like I said, I have plans.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.193
More drinks with the girls? Not a girls' night.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.278
It's my night. You think I wouldn't rather

28:16.278 --> 28:19.948
spend my evening with Sheila? I need this. I need it tonight.

28:19.948 --> 28:22.826
You said you feel responsible for me running this firm.

28:22.826 --> 28:24.911
Fine. You want my help? Here it is.

28:24.911 --> 28:27.831
Instead of trying to prove to Harvey you're a better closer,

28:27.831 --> 28:29.542
why don't you act like a grown-up

28:29.542 --> 28:30.959
and work it out? Or don't.

28:30.959 --> 28:33.337
Either way, I'm going out. Because I've earned it.

28:33.337 --> 28:35.548
Donna, I'm giving you a direct order.

28:35.548 --> 28:37.591
So you can follow it or don't.

28:37.591 --> 28:39.009
But if you don't,

28:39.009 --> 28:41.136
don't you ever tell me you feel responsible

28:41.136 --> 28:43.472
for putting me in this position again.

28:47.184 --> 28:49.687
Ha, ha. That was amazing.

28:49.687 --> 28:50.729
<i>You</i> were amazing.

28:50.729 --> 28:53.232
No,<i> you</i> were amazing.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.400
All right.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.527
I was.

28:56.527 --> 28:58.195
You know what's even more amazing

28:58.195 --> 29:00.239
is we're gonna get 50,000 per client.

29:00.239 --> 29:02.115
You mean 15,000 per client.

29:02.115 --> 29:04.076
No, 50.

29:04.076 --> 29:07.204
Don't tell me you believed that bullshit about their books.

29:07.204 --> 29:08.788
You bet your ass I believed it.

29:08.788 --> 29:10.832
They're not gonna send over cooked books.

29:10.832 --> 29:13.252
Crying poor is the oldest trick in the book.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.379
Not as old as being poor. I was poor.

29:15.379 --> 29:17.839
If you ask me, I'd rather have 50,000 than 15.

29:17.839 --> 29:20.967
I'd rather get them a million, but that's not on the table.

29:20.967 --> 29:24.430
Listen to me. I know you're excited about getting an offer

29:24.430 --> 29:26.348
after being out of the ring for so long--

29:26.348 --> 29:28.808
This isn't about being out of the ring.

29:28.808 --> 29:31.103
This is about getting money for my clients.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.855
It's also supposed to be about getting back in the game

29:33.855 --> 29:35.274
and building a reputation.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.401
This builds a reputation for me just fine.

29:37.401 --> 29:40.153
As someone any competent attorney can eat for breakfast.

29:40.153 --> 29:42.822
Okay. I've heard you out. Now you're gonna hear me.

29:42.822 --> 29:44.450
I heard you. And I'm telling you,

29:44.450 --> 29:45.992
you are making the wrong call.

29:45.992 --> 29:48.203
Well, I disagree. And I appreciate your help,

29:48.203 --> 29:50.706
but this is my case, and we're taking the offer.

29:54.334 --> 29:56.462
Miss Janowitz, why did you conduct

29:56.462 --> 29:59.256
two dozen focus groups before launching your product?

29:59.256 --> 30:01.634
To test the consumers' response to the product.

30:01.634 --> 30:04.136
Except you weren't just testing their responses.

30:04.136 --> 30:05.763
You were reshaping them.

30:05.763 --> 30:08.641
Making changes based on results is the point of a test.

30:08.641 --> 30:10.892
Deliberate changes to make your packaging look

30:10.892 --> 30:12.561
more and more like our client's.

30:12.561 --> 30:14.438
I explained this. Women respond to--

30:14.438 --> 30:17.107
We all know what women respond to.

30:17.107 --> 30:18.525
And you know what?

30:18.525 --> 30:20.902
You gave them exactly what they were looking for,

30:20.902 --> 30:22.946
offered a package they couldn't resist.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.448
And that confused them.

30:24.448 --> 30:27.576
And you can't deny that you knew what you were doing

30:27.576 --> 30:29.077
and how it made them feel.

30:29.077 --> 30:31.413
Is there a question here? I have a question.

30:31.413 --> 30:33.666
Did you know you were breaking the rules

30:33.666 --> 30:36.794
by enticing our loyal customers to stray?

30:36.794 --> 30:39.379
We didn't break any rules. But you flirted with them.

30:39.379 --> 30:41.256
What someone buys is their choice.

30:41.256 --> 30:44.343
Except you confused that. As a result, people wanted something

30:44.343 --> 30:47.095
they didn't mean to want, but couldn't help themselves.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.681
Not true. Admit it. You confused

30:48.681 --> 30:50.724
innocent customers about what they wanted

30:50.724 --> 30:52.976
because you wanted to be what they wanted.

30:52.976 --> 30:54.102
So they'd choose you.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.813
They can't choose you.

30:55.813 --> 30:58.816
No matter how much they want to. They've chosen someone else.

30:58.816 --> 31:01.401
I don't know what's going on between the two of you,

31:01.401 --> 31:03.612
but this deposition is over.

31:11.578 --> 31:13.372
Alex, we need to talk.

31:13.372 --> 31:16.082
No. There's only one thing you'd be here to talk about,

31:16.082 --> 31:17.501
and I wanna stay out of it.

31:17.501 --> 31:19.044
Well, you should know

31:19.044 --> 31:20.713
Rosalie's about to make a mistake.

31:20.713 --> 31:22.548
What? No, forget I asked that.

31:22.548 --> 31:24.842
You did ask. We've got them by the throat,

31:24.842 --> 31:26.968
but unless we take 30 cents on the dollar,

31:26.968 --> 31:28.512
they're gonna go bankrupt. What?

31:28.512 --> 31:30.597
That. You know. They're not going bankrupt.

31:30.597 --> 31:32.599
I'm not gonna stick my nose in her case.

31:32.599 --> 31:35.227
I'm not asking you to. I'm asking if I'm right.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.603
I think I said I'd stay out.

31:36.603 --> 31:38.063
Which means you agree with me.

31:38.063 --> 31:40.148
And I'm saying I think we should counter.

31:40.148 --> 31:42.192
Counter. I can't. She's first chair.

31:42.192 --> 31:43.527
What do you want me to do?

31:43.527 --> 31:45.195
Tell her you think my way is better.

31:45.195 --> 31:48.073
Damn it, I don't wanna say whose way is better.

31:49.324 --> 31:51.577
Alex...

31:51.577 --> 31:54.496
I know you don't want to cause conflict with your wife,

31:54.496 --> 31:57.374
but you know this is the right thing to do.

32:02.713 --> 32:04.923
Look, I know you kids eat late these days,

32:04.923 --> 32:06.341
but shouldn't you be going?

32:06.341 --> 32:08.677
Maybe. But if I can't figure something out soon,

32:08.677 --> 32:10.345
I'll have to cancel with Thomas.

32:10.345 --> 32:11.764
What

32:11.764 --> 32:13.849
Louis is an asshole, and so is Harvey.

32:13.849 --> 32:16.476
That's not a reason, Donna. That's just a Tuesday.

32:16.476 --> 32:19.855
I don't find it funny that Louis and Harvey are in a fight,

32:19.855 --> 32:21.356
and it's gonna ruin my night.

32:21.356 --> 32:24.276
It's not ruining anything. And whatever it is,

32:24.276 --> 32:26.986
it's their problem, not yours. That's I told Louis.

32:26.986 --> 32:29.573
But he threw it back in my face that I'm responsible

32:29.573 --> 32:31.157
for him being managing partner.

32:31.157 --> 32:32.868
I don't give a goddamn what he did.

32:32.868 --> 32:35.120
Stop telling yourself that bullshit right now.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.038
Gretchen-- No. I have seen you

32:37.038 --> 32:39.541
put this firm first more times than I can count.

32:39.541 --> 32:41.543
What you need to be doing is headed home,

32:41.543 --> 32:44.797
putting on that dress I know you laid out this morning.

32:44.797 --> 32:46.089
Okay.

32:47.257 --> 32:48.884
But what about Louis and Harvey?

32:48.884 --> 32:50.886
You leave those two fools to me.

32:57.643 --> 33:00.938
Robert, can I talk to you

33:00.938 --> 33:03.565
You knew Harvey lied to me about Steven Palmer, didn't you?

33:03.565 --> 33:07.068
I did. Robert...

33:08.153 --> 33:10.864
...why didn't you say anything?

33:12.324 --> 33:13.700
Would you have told me

33:13.700 --> 33:15.911
if the shoe was on the other foot?

33:19.122 --> 33:20.707
No, I wouldn't.

33:20.707 --> 33:24.503
Now, Louis, I obviously wasn't successful

33:24.503 --> 33:25.963
dealing with Harvey myself.

33:25.963 --> 33:27.965
But from what I know of the situation,

33:27.965 --> 33:31.217
you stuck your hand in too early and got it bit off.

33:31.217 --> 33:33.470
What would you do? I'd make a gesture

33:33.470 --> 33:36.890
of holding my other hand out. You'd really do that?

33:36.890 --> 33:39.017
Probably not. But I sure wish I would.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.477
And, Louis, one more thing.

33:40.477 --> 33:43.563
Harvey wasn't being disrespectful to you.

33:43.563 --> 33:45.106
He was just treating you

33:45.106 --> 33:47.693
the same way he treated Jessica and me.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.362
I get it.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.071
He's an equal-opportunity asshole.

33:52.071 --> 33:55.158
Serving the community 24 hours a day.

33:55.158 --> 33:56.576
Thank you, Robert.

33:56.576 --> 33:57.744
You're welcome, Louis.

34:02.624 --> 34:05.043
Baby, I don't know what that celery did,

34:05.043 --> 34:07.004
but I want you to know I'm on your side.

34:07.004 --> 34:08.797
Good.

34:08.797 --> 34:11.717
Because that stalk right there just put the moves on me.

34:13.301 --> 34:15.595
Hey. I've been meaning to ask.

34:15.595 --> 34:17.138
How's it going with your case?

34:17.138 --> 34:19.766
You mean Samantha didn't tell you?

34:19.766 --> 34:21.935
We got an offer, and it's amazing.

34:21.935 --> 34:24.229
That's great.

34:24.229 --> 34:26.105
How much?

34:26.105 --> 34:27.774
I don't believe it.

34:27.774 --> 34:29.526
Believe what? You think I can't tell

34:29.526 --> 34:32.696
when you're trying to back

34:32.696 --> 34:34.865
Your mother's 80th birthday? Rosalie.

34:34.865 --> 34:38.076
Uh-huh. Samantha told you, you agree with her. Admit it.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.996
I do. Because I've seen people cook the books before.

34:40.996 --> 34:42.455
Damn it, Alex.

34:42.455 --> 34:44.666
This is what happened in law school.

34:44.666 --> 34:46.835
You think you know better than me.

34:46.835 --> 34:49.922
Well, if you don't respect me as a lawyer,

34:49.922 --> 34:52.465
you just tell me to my face. I do have faith in you.

34:52.465 --> 34:55.052
Only thing that's the same is you don't believe me.

34:55.052 --> 34:58.055
I do respect you, which is why I'm telling you to your face

34:58.055 --> 34:59.514
Reject that deal. Didn't sound

34:59.514 --> 35:01.600
like you were gonna tell that to my face.

35:01.600 --> 35:03.184
You've a chip on your shoulder

35:03.184 --> 35:05.353
that shows up whenever we talk about the law.

35:05.353 --> 35:09.399
Which is why I didn't wanna get involved in the first place.

35:09.399 --> 35:12.569
You really respect me as a lawyer?

35:13.737 --> 35:16.197
I wouldn't have married you if I didn't.

35:16.197 --> 35:17.699
Can we please put our guns down

35:17.699 --> 35:19.576
and just forget that I said anything?

35:19.576 --> 35:20.786
No, we can't.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.538
But we can put our guns down.

35:23.538 --> 35:25.040
What do you mean?

35:25.040 --> 35:28.543
I mean, I wanna take you through<i> why</i> I think

35:28.543 --> 35:29.920
I'm making the right decision.

35:34.466 --> 35:37.218
What can I do for you? You need to sit your ass down

35:37.218 --> 35:39.012
and listen to me. Excuse me?

35:39.012 --> 35:41.723
I see you're on your way to some dinner or card game

35:41.723 --> 35:44.017
or whatever you're spending your time on.

35:44.017 --> 35:45.184
You turn yourself around,

35:45.184 --> 35:46.686
make things right with Louis.

35:46.686 --> 35:48.063
I don't need to do anything.

35:48.063 --> 35:50.816
This is between me and Louis. No, it isn't.

35:50.816 --> 35:52.943
When you get into one of your death matches,

35:52.943 --> 35:54.778
it puts the burden on the rest of us.

35:54.778 --> 35:56.696
And I, for one, am tired of it.

35:56.696 --> 35:59.282
Oh, you're tired of it, are you? Yes, I am.

35:59.282 --> 36:01.785
Makes me sick, the two of you acting like children.

36:01.785 --> 36:04.329
And to think I was considering retiring.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.039
When, if I left now, the two of you

36:06.039 --> 36:07.791
would shit all over your bunk beds.

36:07.791 --> 36:09.876
Are you finished

36:09.876 --> 36:11.962
It's a two-way street, Gretchen.

36:11.962 --> 36:13.922
I'm not the only asshole in the room.

36:13.922 --> 36:16.174
You're the only one in the room right now.

36:17.092 --> 36:20.219
Okay. I said my piece.

36:20.219 --> 36:22.681
I would've been gentle. Sometimes someone needs

36:22.681 --> 36:24.265
to knock the shit out of you.

36:24.265 --> 36:26.643
And Donna just so happens to have plans tonight.

36:31.064 --> 36:32.607
Well

36:32.607 --> 36:35.027
I did. And she's still gonna recommend the deal.

36:35.027 --> 36:36.194
Goddamn it.

36:36.194 --> 36:37.988
That is not what we talked about.

36:37.988 --> 36:41.033
We talked about me telling her what I thought. I did.

36:41.033 --> 36:42.534
Then she changed my mind.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.494
Of course she did. As you've made clear,

36:44.494 --> 36:47.080
your relationship is more important than any client.

36:47.080 --> 36:48.665
I don't care who's first chair.

36:48.665 --> 36:50.333
I'm not letting my clients down.

36:50.333 --> 36:52.878
I'm not backing Rosalie because she's my wife.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.587
She's one hell of a lawyer.

36:54.587 --> 36:56.756
Don't tell me you believe Logan Tech will go under.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.550
You don't know whether they're lying.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.177
That's why I wanna fight, find--

37:00.177 --> 37:02.179
What if you lose? You're not the only one

37:02.179 --> 37:03.972
who knows what it's like to be poor.

37:03.972 --> 37:06.016
When you shake the cushions for change,

37:06.016 --> 37:08.101
the difference between 15,000 and nothing

37:08.101 --> 37:10.395
is a lot bigger than the one between 15 and 50.

37:10.395 --> 37:11.563
I won't lose. You sure?

37:11.563 --> 37:13.065
Because you have lost before,

37:13.065 --> 37:14.900
and one of those times was to me.

37:14.900 --> 37:18.862
So let it go or don't.

37:18.862 --> 37:20.155
But I'm backing my wife.

37:20.155 --> 37:22.741
And one more thing, you said it yourself.

37:22.741 --> 37:25.326
This was supposed to bring us together.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.038
Fine.

37:28.038 --> 37:29.706
I'll let it go.

37:29.706 --> 37:31.708
But that does not mean I agree.

37:31.708 --> 37:33.292
If it makes you feel any better,

37:33.292 --> 37:35.336
if you two didn't team up on this,

37:35.336 --> 37:37.130
those people would be getting nothing.

38:51.246 --> 38:54.624
THOMAS: In the beginning,

38:51.246 --> 38:54.624
it was just me and my garage.

38:54.624 --> 38:58.086
I'd sketch designs on the walls, crank the Boss, and build.

38:58.086 --> 38:59.838
Well, looking at your pieces,

38:59.838 --> 39:01.714
it's obvious you're doing what you love.

39:01.714 --> 39:04.342
What about you

39:04.342 --> 39:05.844
What was she up to?

39:05.844 --> 39:10.473
Twenty-something Donna was eating ramen every night

39:10.473 --> 39:15.187
and acting in an off-off-extra- off-Broadway production

39:15.187 --> 39:16.813
of<i> Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.</i>

39:16.813 --> 39:18.940
Careful, Maggie, your claws are showing.

39:18.940 --> 39:21.234
You know<i> Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i>

39:21.234 --> 39:23.402
I was Brick. In college?

39:23.402 --> 39:25.864
No, ninth grade. But that's not the point.

39:25.864 --> 39:28.325
The point is, if I wasn't so bad at acting,

39:28.325 --> 39:30.785
I never would've realized my passion for design.

39:30.785 --> 39:32.453
So you're saying I was a bad actor,

39:32.453 --> 39:34.122
and that's why I'm a great COO?

39:34.122 --> 39:37.083
You couldn't hide that you liked me when we first met.

39:37.083 --> 39:39.794
Is that how you wanna play this? It doesn't have to be.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.379
In retrospect, I shouldn't have.

39:41.379 --> 39:44.549
Is it getting hot in here or

39:46.009 --> 39:47.844
See, I knew you liked me.

39:48.845 --> 39:50.429
I do.

39:51.973 --> 39:55.143
And I'll tell you something else.

39:55.143 --> 39:59.438
As you know, I was worried about mixing business with pleasure.

39:59.438 --> 40:00.773
But?

40:00.773 --> 40:02.942
I haven't thought about business all night.

40:02.942 --> 40:05.403
So it's been all pleasure. Yeah.

40:06.988 --> 40:09.366
It has. Me too.

40:09.366 --> 40:12.244
Hey, you wanna go somewhere and get a nightcap?

40:12.244 --> 40:13.661
I'd love that.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.672
Louis, I've been looking for you.

40:24.672 --> 40:28.218
I was looking all over for you too. Got thirsty,

40:28.218 --> 40:30.595
thought I'd make myself a caffeine-free prunie.

40:30.595 --> 40:33.765
Do they usually have caffeine? You'd be surprised.

40:33.765 --> 40:36.101
I don't know how to say it,

40:36.101 --> 40:37.727
so I'm just gonna come out with it.

40:37.727 --> 40:40.897
I'm sorry. I'm sorry too, Harvey.

40:40.897 --> 40:43.191
I stepped in too early, I shouldn't have.

40:43.191 --> 40:46.778
I wish I could say I won't do it again,

40:46.778 --> 40:48.029
but I probably will.

40:48.029 --> 40:50.782
Oh, you definitely will. You are right.

40:50.782 --> 40:53.159
Another thing I might do again is call the client

40:53.159 --> 40:55.494
I'm trying to sign, tell them to sign with you.

40:55.494 --> 40:57.747
You're the best lawyer I've ever worked with.

40:57.747 --> 41:00.541
That's never gonna change. Called Palmer and said that?

41:00.541 --> 41:01.876
I did.

41:01.876 --> 41:04.587
That's funny because I called him,

41:04.587 --> 41:07.506
told him I was the best lawyer you ever worked with too.

41:07.506 --> 41:09.050
No, you didn't. No, I didn't.

41:09.050 --> 41:10.718
I told him he should sign with you.

41:10.718 --> 41:12.929
Because there's no lawyer in this city

41:12.929 --> 41:15.556
that I'd be more afraid to go up against than you.

41:17.516 --> 41:19.227
You think it worked?

41:19.227 --> 41:22.397
Tell you the truth, I don't care if we sign Steven Palmer or not.

41:22.397 --> 41:24.899
We're the two best lawyers in this city,

41:24.899 --> 41:27.026
and that is never gonna change.

41:28.320 --> 41:29.779
Thank you, Harvey.

41:29.779 --> 41:31.948
Thank you, Managing Partner.

41:34.700 --> 41:36.995

41:59.267 --> 42:00.977
I know.

42:03.271 --> 42:07.484
Wow. They never actually come that fast when I want them to.

42:07.484 --> 42:09.527
What can I say? I've got a way with cabs.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.988
Thank you, Thomas, for an amazing night.

42:11.988 --> 42:13.781
Donna, I've just gotta tell you,

42:13.781 --> 42:16.242
sometimes you don't know what you've been missing

42:16.242 --> 42:17.660
until you have it.

42:17.660 --> 42:20.788
So look, I don't wanna wait three days to call you

42:20.788 --> 42:24.125
or whatever the rules are. Can we just skip that?

42:24.125 --> 42:25.918
Can tomorrow be our three days?

42:25.918 --> 42:29.630
What if we just say it's tonight?

42:29.630 --> 42:31.299
And you come on up.

42:31.299 --> 42:32.509
I just called a cab.
