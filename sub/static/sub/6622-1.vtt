<i>Shelley?</i>

00:43.669 --> 00:44.587
<i>Dance with me?</i>

00:45.087 --> 00:47.339
In your dreams,
loser.

00:58.434 --> 01:00.019
<i>Oh, Lily?</i>

01:01.228 --> 01:03.064
<i>Wi--will you
dance with me?</i>

01:03.355 --> 01:04.315
Eww.

01:13.157 --> 01:14.742
<i>Um, Paige?</i>

01:16.494 --> 01:18.370
<i>W-w-would you
dance with me?</i>

01:18.579 --> 01:21.123
I'd rather be
boiled alive.

01:28.506 --> 01:29.590
<i>Hi, Kate.</i>

01:29.757 --> 01:31.383
<i>Want to dance?</i>

01:31.550 --> 01:32.885
Maybe later, Jeremy.

01:33.052 --> 01:35.638
Okay. Maybe later.

01:44.605 --> 01:45.898
Hi, Dorothy.

01:46.398 --> 01:47.233
Um...

01:47.983 --> 01:49.777
Do you want to
dance with me?

02:08.379 --> 02:09.380
<i>Come on up here.</i>

02:10.089 --> 02:11.632
- Shh.
- Shh.

02:14.718 --> 02:15.594
Check it out!

02:15.761 --> 02:17.429
<i>Thick and thin
gettin' it on.</i>

02:17.638 --> 02:18.389
<i>That's nasty.</i>

02:18.556 --> 02:19.682
Like it, Buffalo?
gettin' hot?

02:19.849 --> 02:21.308
Stop it.
Get away from me.

02:21.475 --> 02:23.561
Is Pervert at it again?
Perv attack you?

02:23.727 --> 02:26.730
Yeah. Jeremy attacked me.
He attacked me.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.107
Pervert jumped Buffalo.

02:29.150 --> 02:30.025
I didn't know.

02:30.192 --> 02:31.068
Pervert.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.286
<i>Come on,
let's get him!</i>

02:40.452 --> 02:41.412
<i>Yeah!</i>

02:44.081 --> 02:44.999
<i>Pound him!</i>

02:45.624 --> 02:47.459
<i>Slap him in the face!</i>

02:48.127 --> 02:48.878
Get him!

02:49.420 --> 02:50.087
Oh!

03:18.407 --> 03:19.700
It's simple, really,

03:19.867 --> 03:20.618
Shelley.

03:20.784 --> 03:21.952
You see...

03:22.119 --> 03:24.246
from an evolutionary
point of view,

03:24.538 --> 03:27.124
Jason looks for
an attractive young woman

03:27.291 --> 03:28.959
because he wants
healthy children.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.836
and a young woman
like yourself

03:31.003 --> 03:32.963
looks for
a successful man

03:33.214 --> 03:34.590
like Jason...

03:34.798 --> 03:36.634
because she wants
to feel safe.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.177
Um...

03:38.928 --> 03:42.181
Jason has some, uh,
spinach in his teeth.

03:42.514 --> 03:43.474
Oh.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.059
Thanks.

03:47.645 --> 03:48.437
Anyway...

03:48.604 --> 03:50.898
and so the species
survives.

03:51.232 --> 03:52.233
<i>I mean...</i>

03:52.399 --> 03:53.692
what else is there,

03:53.859 --> 03:55.027
really,

03:55.194 --> 03:56.570
in the end?

03:56.946 --> 03:58.405
In the end.

03:59.114 --> 04:00.032
Well...

04:00.741 --> 04:02.201
there's the check.

04:02.743 --> 04:03.494
Check, please.

04:03.661 --> 04:04.328
<i>Yes.</i>

04:04.495 --> 04:06.163
Can I get you
to get my car?

04:06.330 --> 04:07.414
<i>- Of course.</i>
- Thank you.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.250
Um...

04:09.541 --> 04:10.751
No dessert?

04:11.252 --> 04:14.255
Um, no.
I'm sorry, I have finals.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.090
Oh, that's too bad.

04:16.257 --> 04:18.092
<i>- Thank you very much.</i>
- Thank you.

04:21.053 --> 04:22.012
Whoa.

04:22.179 --> 04:23.931
<i>Muy expensivo.</i>

04:24.974 --> 04:27.434
Let's see...
you had the salmon

04:27.601 --> 04:29.770
<i>and the crab cocktail.</i>

04:29.979 --> 04:32.606
<i>I had the chicken
and the salad.</i>

04:32.898 --> 04:35.609
<i>and that would be...</i>

04:35.818 --> 04:36.819
Right.

04:37.486 --> 04:39.280
Okay, well,
thank you, Jason.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.948
It was nice
to meet you.

04:41.115 --> 04:42.908
What, that's it?

04:43.158 --> 04:43.951
What's it?

04:44.118 --> 04:45.536
Don't I get a kiss?

04:45.703 --> 04:46.620
Excuse me?

04:46.787 --> 04:48.205
It's just a little
frickin' kiss.

04:48.372 --> 04:49.498
Oh, God.

04:49.665 --> 04:52.418
Look, this "hard to get" shit
doesn't play with Jason.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.088
You know, Jason,
I'm not a doctor yet,

04:56.255 --> 04:57.464
but it's
my considered opinion

04:57.631 --> 04:59.675
you seek
psychiatric help.

05:00.592 --> 05:01.844
Soon.

05:05.556 --> 05:06.932
Says you.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.859
Jason likes your dress.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.412
Okay, Chad,

06:10.579 --> 06:12.414
it's just you and me now.

06:12.581 --> 06:14.124
I promise to be gentle.

06:17.044 --> 06:20.923
Strong, silent type.
How refreshing.

06:32.434 --> 06:33.685
Okay.

06:34.103 --> 06:36.397

06:43.070 --> 06:44.113

06:51.870 --> 06:53.080
Hello?

07:37.666 --> 07:38.750
Oh!

07:38.917 --> 07:40.127
Oh, God.

07:40.961 --> 07:41.795
Jesus.

07:41.962 --> 07:42.838
Oh my God.

07:43.005 --> 07:44.506
You scared the shit
out of me.

07:44.673 --> 07:45.674
Sorry.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.218
Oh wow.

07:48.469 --> 07:49.970
It's awfully late.

07:50.637 --> 07:51.972
You gonna be okay
in here all alone?

07:52.347 --> 07:54.850
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I've got Chad.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.143
My corpse.

07:56.310 --> 07:57.186
Oh.

07:59.396 --> 08:00.814
Uh...
well, uh...

08:02.191 --> 08:02.983
Good luck tomorrow.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.401
Yeah, thanks. you too.

08:04.568 --> 08:05.486
Thanks.

Come on, Kate.
You promised.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.128
Paige, today at work,

13:15.295 --> 13:17.380
I wrote a column about
computer monitor dust wipes.

13:17.547 --> 13:18.381
Mm-hmm.

13:18.548 --> 13:20.050
Isn't that enough pain
for one day?

13:20.217 --> 13:21.635
This isn't painful.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.512
I mean, painful's
blind dating.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.764
Painful's meeting
someone on the internet

13:25.931 --> 13:27.891
and finding out that
6-footish really means...

13:28.058 --> 13:30.185
5'4" with loafers.
I know.

13:30.352 --> 13:34.064
Oh, Kate. You meet
thirty guys a night.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.650
And you get thirty seconds
apiece unless you want more.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.276
I mean,
it's brilliant.

13:38.443 --> 13:39.694
It'll be fun.

13:39.861 --> 13:42.781
I haven't really completely
broken up with Adam yet.

13:42.948 --> 13:44.074
Oh, but you will.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.368
Believe me, relationships
don't make U-turns,

13:46.535 --> 13:48.370
and Adam's a drunk.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.080
He's not a drunk.

13:50.247 --> 13:52.707
He's a borderline
addictive personality

13:52.874 --> 13:54.751
who happens to
like alcohol a lot.

13:54.918 --> 13:55.961

13:56.628 --> 13:59.339
All right. Fine.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.517
<i>She makes
her own turtlenecks.</i>

14:10.809 --> 14:12.394
She had nine children.

14:12.602 --> 14:13.979
<i>Awesome, huh?</i>

14:14.145 --> 14:15.313
She's, uh...

14:15.605 --> 14:17.732
she's a pretty
amazing woman.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.195
Hi.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.447
Left me out
in the goddamn blue.

14:25.323 --> 14:26.825
Says she can do better.

14:27.659 --> 14:28.493
<i>Says...</i>

14:28.785 --> 14:30.871
I don't fulfill
her needs.

14:31.162 --> 14:32.414

The Bible is the foundation

I know what
you're thinking.

14:58.481 --> 14:59.399
You do?

14:59.566 --> 15:01.276
You're thinking you want
to get the hell out of here.

15:02.110 --> 15:03.278
That's pretty good.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.243
Hi there.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.078
<i>Hi there.</i>

15:12.954 --> 15:14.247
I'm Paige.

15:14.956 --> 15:15.999
Brian.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.711
Brian,
did my friend mention

15:19.878 --> 15:22.213
that she's in
a serious relationship?

15:23.924 --> 15:26.009
No, actually, she didn't.

15:27.010 --> 15:28.303
But I'm free.

15:32.015 --> 15:33.600
You are appalling,
you know that?

15:33.767 --> 15:35.727
Hey, you had
your thirty seconds.

15:35.894 --> 15:37.771
24. You took my last 6.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.022
Oh, right.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.565
Hello?

15:41.566 --> 15:42.734
Dorothy, you're never
gonna believe

15:42.901 --> 15:44.361
what Paige made me do.

15:44.694 --> 15:45.862
What?

15:48.657 --> 15:49.950
Oh my God.

15:50.909 --> 15:51.701
What?

those of us left behind

16:04.005 --> 16:05.715
to share our burden.

16:06.091 --> 16:08.051
I never know what to do
in situations like this.

16:08.218 --> 16:09.970
I'm really bad at it.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.598
I know that we're
supposed to be...

16:14.057 --> 16:15.141
takin' a break and all,

16:15.308 --> 16:16.810
I just thought
you needed a friend.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.230
I'm glad you're here.

16:20.480 --> 16:21.439
Yeah.

16:22.315 --> 16:23.274
So, um...

16:25.527 --> 16:26.611
What do I do?

16:28.905 --> 16:30.156
I'm sorry.

16:33.076 --> 16:34.452
Hey...

16:36.997 --> 16:38.206
Front page.

16:46.089 --> 16:48.258
Kate, that's for
Spencer Marks.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.843
You remember.

16:50.051 --> 16:52.762
I mean, we both started
on the paper together.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.808
Look, anyway, they just named
him lead reporter on the Giants,

16:56.975 --> 16:59.561
so I just got it for him
as a gift. That's all.

17:01.604 --> 17:02.522
Okay.

17:03.314 --> 17:04.899
I'm sorry.
It doesn't matter.

17:05.066 --> 17:06.234
Of course it matters.

17:06.568 --> 17:09.070
Look, I haven't touched
a thing in three weeks.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.699
I'm doing
really good, Kate.

17:16.619 --> 17:17.412
So, uh...

17:18.663 --> 17:21.624
You think we can...
get together this week?

17:21.958 --> 17:23.501
Dinner or something?

17:24.836 --> 17:25.920
I don't know.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.380
Come on.
It's just dinner.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.715
Not a marriage proposal.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.009
Adam, the last time
you and I had dinner,

17:31.176 --> 17:33.720
we ended up in a hotel in
Lake Tahoe for three days.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.263
Oh, yeah. Right.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.848
That.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.017
- That.
- Yeah.

17:42.771 --> 17:43.688
Yeah.

17:46.232 --> 17:47.984
I'll call you, okay?

17:48.151 --> 17:49.152
Yeah.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.702
- Take care.
- Okay.

18:22.519 --> 18:24.020
Hmm.

18:25.897 --> 18:27.357
He looks good, huh?

18:27.732 --> 18:30.693
Kate, that boy
always looks good.

18:31.236 --> 18:32.529
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.030
Was that Adam?

18:34.322 --> 18:36.407
Please don't give me a hard
time about this right now.

18:36.574 --> 18:37.617
Sorry.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.619
Jesus, Paige.
It's a funeral.

18:39.786 --> 18:40.912
What?

18:43.957 --> 18:45.500
Did you guys see
the police are here

18:45.667 --> 18:46.626
talking to people?

18:46.793 --> 18:48.753
Yeah, I know. So awful.

18:50.421 --> 18:52.215

18:53.007 --> 18:54.175
I don't know. I...

18:54.926 --> 18:56.719
I can't believe
she's gone.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.723
Excuse me, ladies.
I'm Detective Vaughn.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.475
I understand you're
friends of Shelley?

19:03.059 --> 19:05.019
Yeah, we've known her
since we were kids.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.855
Care if I ask you
a few questions?

19:07.021 --> 19:08.273
- Sure.
- Yeah.

19:08.439 --> 19:09.816
When's the last time
you saw her?

19:10.441 --> 19:12.360
Um, about a year ago.

19:12.527 --> 19:14.195
- More like two for me.
- Same here.

19:14.362 --> 19:16.406
Yeah, she was really busy
with med school.

19:17.866 --> 19:19.993
You know anyone by the name
of Jason Marquette?

19:20.368 --> 19:21.161
Who's that?

19:21.327 --> 19:23.163
Shelley was with him
the night that she died.

19:23.371 --> 19:24.539
Now he's missing.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.128
<i>Listen, ladies,</i>

19:31.588 --> 19:33.715
If you think of
anything, anyone...

19:34.841 --> 19:36.134
<i>just give me
a call, okay?</i>

19:40.430 --> 19:42.056
Okay, ladies.
Take care.

19:42.932 --> 19:44.017
Thanks.

19:45.643 --> 19:46.394
Ooh.

20:05.705 --> 20:06.748
Hmm.

20:10.251 --> 20:11.920
<i>"Roses are red...</i>

20:12.462 --> 20:13.838
<i>"Violets are blue...</i>

20:15.381 --> 20:18.843
<i>"They'll need dental records
to identify you!"</i>

20:25.725 --> 20:26.976
Hey, Dorothy.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.562
Oh. Hey, Campbell.

20:31.814 --> 20:32.857
Come in.

20:41.032 --> 20:43.076
Cozy little place you have.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.161
Is everything okay?

20:45.870 --> 20:49.624
Uh...well actually I feel
a little weird about this.

20:49.791 --> 20:51.084
In fact, I tried
calling you earlier,

20:51.251 --> 20:52.543
but you weren't home.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.128
I need to ask you
a favor.

20:54.712 --> 20:55.630
Sure.

20:55.922 --> 20:57.382
Well, my roommate,
he's left town,

20:57.548 --> 20:59.133
and he hasn't been paying
his share of the rent.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.885
So when I got home today,
I found out that all my stuff

21:01.052 --> 21:02.929
had been thrown out
on the sidewalk.

21:03.513 --> 21:06.182
Skis, CDs, clothes,
everything just gone.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.351
And of course the timing
couldn't be worse

21:08.518 --> 21:10.937
because every penny I have
is invested in this start-up.

21:13.690 --> 21:14.941
Millie?

21:16.567 --> 21:17.860
Millie!

21:19.779 --> 21:21.322
Can you please make up
a guest room?

21:21.489 --> 21:23.241
- Oh, no, Dorothy, I couldn't--
- Wait.

21:23.408 --> 21:24.575
<i>Did your father say</i>?

21:24.742 --> 21:26.661
No. I said.

21:29.414 --> 21:31.332
Uhh, Dorothy, I'm embarrassed
about this.

21:31.499 --> 21:33.501
- I mean--
- Don't be ridiculous.

21:33.710 --> 21:35.169
Go get yourself
settled in,

21:35.336 --> 21:36.838
and I will be
right there.

21:37.922 --> 21:39.048
You...

21:39.299 --> 21:41.217
You're the best.

21:41.801 --> 21:42.635
Mmm.

21:43.011 --> 21:43.720
Thanks.

21:43.886 --> 21:45.179
You're welcome.

21:49.934 --> 21:53.688
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
Who's your friend?

21:54.022 --> 21:55.940
His name is Campbell,
and I met him at yoga,

21:56.107 --> 21:57.150
and he's off-limits.

21:57.317 --> 21:59.319
So just let my dad know he's
staying here for a few days.

21:59.485 --> 22:00.695
Is he the reason
you've been

22:00.862 --> 22:02.322
spending all your time
on the treadmill?

22:02.488 --> 22:03.740
Kim, you're not
my girlfriend,

22:03.906 --> 22:05.116
and you're
not my mother.

22:05.283 --> 22:07.243
I'm just taking an interest
in your life, Dorothy,

22:07.452 --> 22:09.454
you know,
as your stepmom.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.998
When you're old enough
to rent a car by yourself,

22:12.165 --> 22:13.833
we can discuss your role
as my stepmother.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.252
In the meantime,
don't talk about my sex life.

22:16.419 --> 22:19.088
You have a sex life?

22:19.380 --> 22:22.508
Yeah, I do, and I don't charge
by the hour like you.

22:23.134 --> 22:24.135
How dare you!

22:24.302 --> 22:25.219
Oh, get your
hands off me,

22:25.386 --> 22:26.554
you mail-order bride
from hell.

22:27.972 --> 22:29.557
Hey! Break it up,
you two.

22:29.724 --> 22:33.394
She just called me
a mail-order bride from hell.

22:33.561 --> 22:34.437
Dorothy.

22:34.604 --> 22:36.731
Well I don't even <i>know</i>
what she just called me.

22:38.900 --> 22:39.817
It's okay, sweetheart.

22:41.652 --> 22:44.030
You have to show
more respect to my wife.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.576
But, dad, she--

23:21.067 --> 23:22.026
Hello?

23:33.079 --> 23:34.038
Hello?

23:59.647 --> 24:01.941
Oh, come on.

24:03.067 --> 24:04.444
Not today.

24:05.528 --> 24:06.779
Geez.

24:10.741 --> 24:11.659
Classic.

24:12.535 --> 24:14.912
Murray, Murray, Murray.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.039
<i>Hi. You've reached Murray,</i>

24:17.206 --> 24:19.167
<i>the super.
Leave a message.</i>

24:19.333 --> 24:21.627
Murray,
it's Kate in 403.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.379
So, I don't
have any water,

24:23.546 --> 24:25.673
and I have to be at work
in a half hour,

24:25.840 --> 24:27.133
and I've got crap
in my hair.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.927
And--damn it!

24:32.388 --> 24:33.806
Murray!
are you there?

24:34.015 --> 24:35.224
Shit.

24:37.643 --> 24:38.936
Ha.

24:41.856 --> 24:42.857
Of course.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.921
Oh, God.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.841
Ugh.

25:11.052 --> 25:12.845
Perfect timing, Murray.

25:13.554 --> 25:14.764
Hello?

25:17.183 --> 25:18.017
Hello?

25:58.224 --> 25:59.308
<i>Hello, Kate.</i>

25:59.475 --> 26:00.643
Hi, Gary.

26:01.269 --> 26:03.563
You look great, Kate.

26:04.272 --> 26:05.940
<i>How about
a date, Kate?</i>

26:06.524 --> 26:07.984
You can be my mate,
Kate.

26:08.609 --> 26:10.152
You're scary, Gary.

26:12.196 --> 26:14.282
This could be
our fate, Kate.

26:16.284 --> 26:17.952
<i>Uh...
hey there, Lily.</i>

26:18.119 --> 26:19.787
Hey there, yourself.

26:20.037 --> 26:21.747
<i>Thank you for
requesting my tape.</i>

26:21.956 --> 26:22.957
<i>My name's Lance.</i>

26:23.124 --> 26:24.625
Hello, Lance.

26:24.792 --> 26:26.210
<i>I think
I'm perfect for you.</i>

26:26.377 --> 26:28.588
- Mmm.
<i>- I'm outgoing, I'm fun,</i>

26:28.754 --> 26:30.590
<i>I'm 6-footish.</i>

26:32.675 --> 26:34.302
<i>I like board games,</i>

26:34.468 --> 26:36.304
<i>I play a lot of,
uh, ocean sports,</i>

26:36.470 --> 26:38.139
<i>you know, kayak--</i>

26:38.306 --> 26:39.932
Good-bye, Lance.

26:40.141 --> 26:42.268
Better luck
next time, Lance.

26:50.901 --> 26:52.028
Who is it?

26:55.072 --> 26:55.990
Who is it?

26:56.699 --> 26:57.825
There's nobody there.

26:58.409 --> 26:59.452
Probably just Lance.

26:59.619 --> 27:00.995
He doesn't clear
the peephole, remember?

27:05.750 --> 27:06.876
Hello!

27:11.172 --> 27:12.131
Hmm.

27:12.923 --> 27:15.009
- That's strange.
<i>- They were fast.</i>

27:16.177 --> 27:19.597
Ooh, I bet
it's from Max.

27:19.805 --> 27:21.474
The rose.

27:21.641 --> 27:23.517
Valentine.

27:23.934 --> 27:25.061
Let's see it.

27:30.316 --> 27:33.569
<i>"'Tis a well known fact
that beauty is skin deep,</i>

27:33.819 --> 27:37.406
savor the taste...
you are what you eat"

27:37.865 --> 27:39.784
Well, that's sweet,
I think.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.578
It's the strangest
valentine I've ever seen.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.372
<i>Oh, look,
it's not from Max.</i>

27:44.538 --> 27:46.165
<i>Look, "J.M."</i>

27:46.332 --> 27:47.375
Must be for you.

27:47.541 --> 27:48.334
Why?

27:48.501 --> 27:50.753
Because you've covered much more
of the alphabet than I have.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.254
Who's J.M.?

27:52.505 --> 27:54.674
Bite me.
It's definitely for you.

27:55.216 --> 27:56.300
Okay.

27:56.759 --> 27:59.929
You say it's for me,
it's for me.

28:05.601 --> 28:06.936
Mmm.

28:09.563 --> 28:10.398
Oh!

28:20.533 --> 28:21.742
John McCray.

28:21.992 --> 28:23.661
<i>Never even
made a pass at me.</i>

28:24.161 --> 28:25.204
Jeff Malik?

28:25.371 --> 28:27.123
Hmm...not his style.

28:27.289 --> 28:28.666
Jake Matheson.

28:28.999 --> 28:29.917
<i>Gay.</i>

28:30.209 --> 28:32.878
Who is the guy who sent you
the computer virus?

28:33.254 --> 28:34.922
Beckett Broda.

28:35.089 --> 28:36.674
<i>Oh...damn.</i>

28:37.216 --> 28:39.176
J.M., J.M., J.M.

28:40.010 --> 28:41.470
Jeremy Melton?

28:41.887 --> 28:43.472
Who's Jeremy Melton?

28:43.639 --> 28:45.141
<i>I'm kidding.</i>

28:45.433 --> 28:46.892
No, who--who's
Jeremy Melton?

28:47.059 --> 28:48.936
Come on.
Sixth grade?

28:49.812 --> 28:52.398
Pervert,
60 pounds...

28:52.606 --> 28:53.691
buck teeth,

28:53.858 --> 28:55.484
"You look so pretty,
Paige."

28:59.238 --> 29:00.948
<i>He can't still live
in town, can he?</i>

29:01.115 --> 29:02.658
Lily, I'm kidding.

29:02.825 --> 29:04.577
No, I know.
it's just...

29:04.744 --> 29:06.537
what do you think
happened to him?

29:06.704 --> 29:09.165
I don't know.
What does it matter?

29:09.457 --> 29:10.416
It doesn't.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.754
God, we were so horrible
to that kid.

29:14.920 --> 29:15.963
<i>Whatever.</i>

29:16.297 --> 29:19.467
All I know is,
that was nasty.

29:19.633 --> 29:20.760
Guh.

29:25.347 --> 29:26.891
I'm talking maggots.

29:27.057 --> 29:28.976
Actual live worms
inside the chocolate.

29:29.143 --> 29:31.145
Well, at least
he left it at the door.

29:31.479 --> 29:34.064
I swear, there was
someone in my apartment.

29:34.231 --> 29:36.150
I'm telling you, you must have
left your door unlocked.

29:36.317 --> 29:39.195
I mean, we were all
so looped by the time we left.

29:39.403 --> 29:40.571
Yeah, but it still
freaked me out.

29:40.738 --> 29:42.156
You should have
seen this mask.

29:43.616 --> 29:45.367
Look what
we have here.

29:47.912 --> 29:49.121
<i>He's subtle.</i>

29:52.374 --> 29:53.459
<i>Well?</i>

29:53.876 --> 29:55.377
You want to
come over?

29:59.882 --> 30:01.050
Guess not.

30:03.469 --> 30:04.970
- Bye.
- Hey, guys.

30:06.013 --> 30:07.181
This is Max.

30:07.348 --> 30:08.682
Hi, Max. I'm Kate.

30:09.934 --> 30:11.393
Hello, Kate.

30:12.144 --> 30:13.562
That'll do, Max.

30:13.813 --> 30:16.148
I'm just
being polite, Paige.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.609
So, isn't
the show great?

30:19.026 --> 30:21.278
Yeah, it's great.
Cheers.

30:21.445 --> 30:22.863
Better than
your last one.

30:23.739 --> 30:24.740
You hate it.

30:25.574 --> 30:27.076
No. N-no.

30:27.493 --> 30:28.494
<i>It's all right.</i>

30:28.786 --> 30:30.496
I hate it, too,
sometimes.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.706
But an artist
has got to explore.

30:32.873 --> 30:33.874
Mmm.

30:34.083 --> 30:35.793
Max. I'm sorry.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.378
We're having trouble
with the video playback

30:37.545 --> 30:38.587
<i>in the maze.</i>

30:38.921 --> 30:40.256
<i>Christ.</i>

30:41.966 --> 30:43.092
Forgive me.

30:45.845 --> 30:48.264
- Mmm, girl.
- Mmm.

30:51.433 --> 30:52.476
Whoo.

30:53.227 --> 30:54.687
I'll be right back,
you guys.

31:00.276 --> 31:01.068
Hi.

31:01.318 --> 31:02.111
Hello.

31:02.278 --> 31:03.362
I'm Paige.

31:03.529 --> 31:05.072
Oh, hi, Paige.
I'm Campbell.

31:05.614 --> 31:07.074
So, what brings you

31:07.241 --> 31:09.869
to this fascinating
cultural event, Campbell?

31:10.035 --> 31:11.829
That's a very good
question, Paige.

31:11.996 --> 31:13.914
- Actually, I'm here with--
- Hi, guys.

31:14.081 --> 31:15.457
I see you've met Campbell.

31:15.624 --> 31:17.626
Yeah, Paige was just
hitting on him.

31:17.793 --> 31:19.795
Sorry,
I didn't know.

31:20.004 --> 31:22.214
Campbell, this
is Kate and Lily.

31:22.381 --> 31:23.799
And I see you've
already met Paige.

31:23.966 --> 31:25.050
Nice to meet
all of you.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.928
The four of us all had headgear
and braces together.

31:28.095 --> 31:29.346
Really?
Well, it seems

31:29.513 --> 31:30.973
you've all turned
out all right.

31:31.599 --> 31:33.183
Yeah, well.

31:34.685 --> 31:36.770
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yes, please.

31:40.149 --> 31:43.319
Dorothy, what else have you
been keeping to yourself?

31:43.485 --> 31:45.070
Valentine's Day...

31:45.487 --> 31:47.364
What does it mean?

31:47.990 --> 31:49.325
What's it really about?

31:49.491 --> 31:51.327
A celebration of true love?

31:51.452 --> 31:52.828
It was really strange--

31:52.995 --> 31:55.164
a cupid mask,
like a cherub.

31:55.331 --> 31:57.625
Like at that
Valentine's Day dance?

31:57.791 --> 31:58.876
What dance?

32:00.127 --> 32:02.963
Junior high.
God, Jeremy Melton.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.549
Oh, my God,
this is so weird.

32:05.716 --> 32:08.218
We were just talking
about him this afternoon.

32:08.427 --> 32:09.136
Ahem.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.641
<i>So, ladies
and gentlemen,</i>

32:14.016 --> 32:15.976
I hope you enjoy
your blind date.

32:16.894 --> 32:17.895
If you would,

32:18.062 --> 32:19.355
I need the ladies to go
to the left,

32:19.521 --> 32:21.190
and the men to the right.

32:22.775 --> 32:25.069
Ladies one side,
men the other.

32:30.532 --> 32:31.700
Uh-uh-uh.

32:31.867 --> 32:34.662
Ladies one side,
men the other.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.413
Oh...

32:41.919 --> 32:43.671
I really like
the abstract frames.

32:43.837 --> 32:45.506
Mm-hmm. Yes.

32:45.673 --> 32:48.342
<i>What do you like to do?</i>

32:48.801 --> 32:51.679
Wow. What is wrong
with this guy?

32:51.845 --> 32:52.930
- Dorothy!
- Sorry.

32:53.097 --> 32:54.264
Look at that one.

32:55.599 --> 32:58.018
<i>What do you like to do</i>?

32:58.811 --> 33:01.063
<i>What do you like to do?</i>

33:01.814 --> 33:03.774
<i>What do you like to do?</i>

33:04.316 --> 33:06.443
This is like
a lingerie commercial.

33:07.444 --> 33:10.823
That's his point.
It's art. Just keep going.

33:18.414 --> 33:21.583
<i>Love me.
Love me.</i>

33:22.501 --> 33:23.794
<i>Love me.</i>

33:24.712 --> 33:25.963
<i>Love me.</i>

33:26.588 --> 33:28.048
<i>Love me.</i>

33:28.674 --> 33:30.259
<i>Love me.</i>

33:34.680 --> 33:35.764
Guys?

34:09.673 --> 34:10.507
Oh!

34:11.216 --> 34:11.925
What?

34:12.134 --> 34:12.968
Who's that?

34:15.554 --> 34:16.847
<i>Hey, Amy.</i>

34:17.931 --> 34:18.974
That's Amy.

34:19.475 --> 34:21.101
What do you mean,
"That's Amy"?

34:21.268 --> 34:22.644
Get her out of here.

34:23.145 --> 34:24.521
I invited her here.

34:24.688 --> 34:25.773
Excuse me?

34:28.025 --> 34:29.068
Please, relax.

34:29.276 --> 34:31.570
What the hell
are you doing?

34:32.571 --> 34:35.908
It's not like we're in
junior high school, okay?

34:36.950 --> 34:38.494
Look, I've got to go.

34:38.660 --> 34:39.828
I have an early
flight tomorrow.

34:39.995 --> 34:41.121
I don't have
to deal with this.

34:41.288 --> 34:43.040
Great. What--
what's the matter?

34:43.415 --> 34:44.625
Oh, what's the matter?

34:44.792 --> 34:46.210
Well, the problem is,
you turned out to be

34:46.376 --> 34:49.505
a cheap,
hypocritical sleazeball.

34:50.297 --> 34:52.466
Yeah, but you knew that.

34:57.179 --> 34:59.848
So does this mean you're not
gonna be my Valentine?

35:01.683 --> 35:02.810
<i>Hold m</i> e.

35:02.976 --> 35:03.977
<i>Love me. Love me.</i>

35:04.144 --> 35:06.480
<i>I'm so lonely.
Hold me.</i>

35:06.647 --> 35:12.694
<i>Love me. Love me.
Love me. Love me. Love me.</i>

35:13.112 --> 35:15.614
<i>'Til death do us part.</i>

35:16.115 --> 35:17.866
<i>'Til death do us part.</i>

35:18.033 --> 35:20.160
<i>To love until death...</i>

35:23.539 --> 35:25.165
<i>Don't walk away
from me.</i>

35:25.332 --> 35:26.959
<i>Don't walk away from me.</i>

35:27.126 --> 35:28.710
<i>Don't walk away from me.</i>

35:28.877 --> 35:30.045
<i>Don't walk away from me.</i>

35:31.547 --> 35:33.048
Woman, distorted:
<i>Love me. Love me...</i>

35:33.215 --> 35:35.342
<i>love me...love me...</i>

36:19.469 --> 36:21.722
<i>I said I want
my money back.</i>

36:21.930 --> 36:24.266
Hey, leech,
I'm talking to you.

36:24.433 --> 36:25.851
Listen, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

36:26.018 --> 36:27.311
<i>- Oh, really?
- That's right.</i>

36:27.477 --> 36:29.104
- Hey, is everything okay?
- Yeah.

36:29.271 --> 36:31.565
Oh. Well, well.
If it isn't the latest victim.

36:31.732 --> 36:33.442
Excuse me,
who are you?

36:33.775 --> 36:35.110
That's none
of your business.

36:35.402 --> 36:37.696
- She's no one.
<i>- No one?</i>

36:37.863 --> 36:39.072
That's right,
I'm just the idiot

36:39.239 --> 36:40.324
who's still waiting
for the return

36:40.490 --> 36:41.992
<i>on her internet
investment.</i>

36:42.201 --> 36:43.493
What did you call that
again, hmm?

36:43.660 --> 36:45.287
Bleed Me Dry dot com?

36:45.495 --> 36:47.247
Yeah, that's nice.
Okay, let's go, Dorothy.

36:48.540 --> 36:51.126
Watch your back, leech.

36:52.169 --> 36:53.837
<i>Well, sorry
I couldn't make it.</i>

36:54.004 --> 36:55.047
You didn't
miss much,

36:55.214 --> 36:56.215
Except for Dorothy's
boyfriend

36:56.381 --> 36:57.925
getting attacked
by some crazy woman.

36:58.091 --> 36:59.635
Oh, and some
really bad art.

36:59.801 --> 37:02.054
I mean, this stuff
was basically porn.

37:02.221 --> 37:03.597
That sounds okay.

37:06.683 --> 37:09.436
I don't know, things have
just been really weird lately.

37:09.770 --> 37:11.521
I mean, today I find
this cupid mask

37:11.688 --> 37:13.482
in the elevator.
I turn around,

37:13.649 --> 37:16.109
and there's my creepy
neighbor leering at me.

37:16.735 --> 37:19.112
"Don't be late, Kate.
You're first-rate, Kate."

37:19.279 --> 37:20.906
- That guy?
- Yes, that guy.

37:21.990 --> 37:23.408
Every time I do
my laundry, he's there.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.410
Day, night,
doesn't matter.

37:27.162 --> 37:28.664
Knock it off.

37:29.081 --> 37:30.249
And yesterday
I noticed

37:30.415 --> 37:31.583
that my underwear
was missing.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.293
Oh, yeah, don't worry
about that. That was me.

37:33.585 --> 37:35.837
I like to try them on,
you know?

37:36.004 --> 37:37.381
Makes me feel free.

37:37.547 --> 37:39.591
I tap in to my,
you know, feminine side.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.134
What's it gonna be
tonight?

37:41.301 --> 37:42.469
Can I please
have a Corona?

37:42.636 --> 37:44.054
Just a club soda,
please.

37:45.222 --> 37:46.556
Actually,
make that two.

37:46.723 --> 37:47.891
<i>Sure.</i>

37:50.686 --> 37:52.062
So...

37:54.982 --> 37:56.358
what do you say?

37:59.361 --> 38:01.655
I'm just asking you
for a chance, that's all.

38:03.115 --> 38:04.783
I want to, Adam, but...

38:06.994 --> 38:09.454
You drink. And you
get out of control,

38:09.621 --> 38:10.789
and it scares me.

38:10.956 --> 38:11.999
I've stopped.

38:12.499 --> 38:13.542
I've changed.

38:13.750 --> 38:14.960
So then it won't
make a difference

38:15.127 --> 38:16.461
if you have
to wait a little.

38:23.802 --> 38:24.803
Right.

38:25.137 --> 38:26.763
I don't get it.
We told you,

38:26.930 --> 38:29.141
we haven't seen Shelley
in over a year.

38:29.391 --> 38:30.642
How are we going
to help you?

38:30.809 --> 38:31.768
<i>Humor me.</i>

38:32.769 --> 38:34.604
By the way, wasn't there
another one of you?

38:35.230 --> 38:36.148
<i>Lily.</i>

38:36.315 --> 38:37.691
She's out of town.

38:40.902 --> 38:43.572
These are remembrance cards
sent to the parents.

38:43.739 --> 38:44.906
Take a look at this.

38:45.073 --> 38:46.325
<i>It's odd.</i>

38:50.454 --> 38:51.621
<i>Jeremy Melton.</i>

38:53.498 --> 38:54.708
J.M.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.714
Jeremy Melton,
geez.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.257
Who's Jeremy Melton?

39:02.424 --> 39:04.926
This loser
from sixth grade.

39:05.093 --> 39:06.303
He and Shelley
were friends?

39:06.470 --> 39:07.262
<i>No,
that's the thing.</i>

39:07.429 --> 39:08.597
we haven't seen him
in years.

39:08.764 --> 39:09.765
Why would he send
a card?

39:09.931 --> 39:10.932
Because it's him.

39:12.351 --> 39:13.810
It's Jeremy.

39:14.811 --> 39:17.230
I got a valentine the other day,
and it was awful,

39:17.397 --> 39:18.774
it was someone saying that
they were gonna kill me,

39:18.940 --> 39:20.108
and it was signed "J.M."

39:20.275 --> 39:22.444
Ours, too--the card
in our chocolates.

39:23.487 --> 39:26.740
You both received
threatening notes signed "J.M."?

39:26.907 --> 39:29.076
And after I tell you I'm looking
for a Jason Marquette,

39:29.242 --> 39:30.911
you don't think
to mention it?

39:31.495 --> 39:33.121
I thought
it was a joke.

39:33.413 --> 39:36.375
Okay. Why would Jeremy Melton
want to hurt you?

39:36.625 --> 39:38.835
Well, he attacked me
at a dance in junior high,

39:39.002 --> 39:40.796
and he got sent to reform
school because of it.

39:40.962 --> 39:42.506
Well, that would explain
why he threatened you,

39:42.672 --> 39:44.966
but why go after Shelley?
Why your friends?

39:45.550 --> 39:46.885
I don't know,
but he is.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.303
<i>You don't know that.</i>

39:48.470 --> 39:50.138
The truth is, some kid
that you all teased

39:50.305 --> 39:51.765
in the sixth grade
is probably not worth

39:51.932 --> 39:53.392
getting
all worked up over.

39:59.981 --> 40:02.025
But I'll go
check it out anyway.

40:03.568 --> 40:04.778
You do that.

40:06.530 --> 40:08.281
I'm next.
I know I'm next.

40:08.490 --> 40:09.866
What are
you talking about?

40:10.033 --> 40:11.618
Because Jeremy got
sent to reform school

40:11.785 --> 40:12.994
because of me.

40:13.161 --> 40:14.663
Dorothy,
he attacked you.

40:16.581 --> 40:17.833
Dorothy...

40:21.002 --> 40:23.880
He did attack you, right?

40:25.674 --> 40:28.051
No. He didn't.

40:30.137 --> 40:31.555
<i>I just said
that he did.</i>

40:31.763 --> 40:33.181
Why would you
do that?

40:34.433 --> 40:36.643
You guys wouldn't
understand.

40:38.061 --> 40:40.939
Do you remember what
I looked like back then?

40:41.356 --> 40:43.483
You... you were bigger.

40:43.650 --> 40:46.111
Y-you were
big-boned.

40:46.611 --> 40:50.115
- You were plump.
- I was fat, okay?

40:50.699 --> 40:51.908
The only person
that looked at me

40:52.075 --> 40:53.452
the whole night
was Jeremy.

40:53.618 --> 40:54.953
And then when
those guys came up,

40:55.120 --> 40:56.329
and they saw us
making out,

40:56.496 --> 40:58.707
I couldn't bear it.
and so...

40:59.499 --> 41:00.750
I lied.

41:01.251 --> 41:03.336
And I said
he attacked me.

41:03.503 --> 41:04.921
Dorothy, why didn't
you say something

41:05.088 --> 41:06.423
about this to Vaughn?

41:06.673 --> 41:08.175
I just couldn't.

41:09.050 --> 41:12.012
Dorothy, I really
wouldn't worry about this.

41:12.304 --> 41:14.306
Jeremy Melton couldn't
manage a water fountain

41:14.473 --> 41:15.932
without screwing up.

41:16.099 --> 41:19.394
<i>I don't think he's capable of
an intricate revenge plot.</i>

41:41.416 --> 41:42.334
<i>Hmm.</i>

41:43.502 --> 41:45.212
<i>- Hi.</i>
- God, you scared me.

41:45.378 --> 41:46.421
What are you
doing here?

41:46.588 --> 41:47.839
I thought we were
having dinner.

41:48.006 --> 41:48.882
We are?

41:50.050 --> 41:53.637
Oh, we are. I'm sorry.
I completely forgot.

41:53.762 --> 41:55.680
I'm just a little
distracted.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.140
What's up?

41:57.516 --> 41:59.935
Uh, it's probably
nothing.

42:00.268 --> 42:02.729
And you wouldn't
believe me if I told you.

42:03.355 --> 42:05.065
So you think
it's far-fetched, right,

42:05.232 --> 42:08.443
this whole Jeremy Melton/
Revenge of the Nerds theory?

42:09.694 --> 42:11.029
I don't know.

42:14.533 --> 42:15.992
Well, what should I do?

42:16.159 --> 42:18.703
I'm thinking Mexico,
the two of us,

42:18.870 --> 42:20.956
just 'til this all
blows over, all right?

42:24.292 --> 42:25.168
Well.

42:26.962 --> 42:28.088
Well.

42:29.589 --> 42:33.385
- Want to come up?
- Yeah, I do, believe me.

42:44.563 --> 42:45.605
I do...

42:47.691 --> 42:48.608
But...?

42:48.984 --> 42:50.777
I don't want you
to do something tonight

42:50.986 --> 42:51.778
that you're going
to write off

42:51.945 --> 42:53.154
as a weak moment
tomorrow.

42:53.363 --> 42:57.075
So...get upstairs
before I lose my will.

43:02.789 --> 43:03.748
Kate.

43:05.208 --> 43:07.627
Don't worry about it,
all right?

43:07.919 --> 43:09.212
Everything's
gonna be all right.

43:10.964 --> 43:12.090
Okay.

43:15.969 --> 43:18.805
Okay, so first you
guys get Melton shipped off

43:18.972 --> 43:20.473
to reform school.

43:20.640 --> 43:23.268
A year later,
he lands in juvenile hall.

43:23.518 --> 43:26.229
Six months after that,
a state-run mental hospital.

43:26.563 --> 43:27.606
That's awful.

43:28.273 --> 43:29.733
You must have done
some number on him

43:29.899 --> 43:30.817
at the dance, huh?

43:33.236 --> 43:34.446
Where is he now,
detective?

43:34.613 --> 43:35.488
No idea.
All we know

43:35.655 --> 43:37.157
is that his parents
died in a fire

43:37.324 --> 43:38.575
a couple years back.

43:38.742 --> 43:39.868
Was he involved?

43:40.035 --> 43:41.870
Don't know.
Ruled an accident.

43:42.037 --> 43:43.455
Follow me. I want to
show you something.

43:44.039 --> 43:45.165
I pulled a file photo,

43:45.332 --> 43:47.208
and I ran some
enhancements.

43:54.341 --> 43:55.425
Here we go.

43:56.176 --> 43:57.177
<i>That's him.</i>

43:57.802 --> 43:58.887
Right.

43:59.471 --> 44:01.806
But know anybody
that looks like this?

44:02.682 --> 44:04.225
<i>Or this?</i>

44:05.101 --> 44:06.561
Or this?

44:07.729 --> 44:08.772
Or this?

44:09.689 --> 44:11.524
<i>Brown contacts,
blue, green.</i>

44:11.733 --> 44:13.401
Beard, goatee,
mustache.

44:13.568 --> 44:14.986
Ten years
is a long time,

44:15.153 --> 44:16.196
and that's not counting
the possibility

44:16.363 --> 44:17.656
<i>of plastic surgery.</i>

44:17.906 --> 44:20.075
Do you have any more
recent pictures of him?

44:22.202 --> 44:24.287
If we did, don't you think
we'd be looking at them?

44:24.829 --> 44:26.748
The point is,
this could be anyone.

44:26.915 --> 44:28.083
Where's your friend Lily?

44:28.249 --> 44:30.627
We told you,
she's in L.A.

44:31.836 --> 44:32.754
What about Max Raimi?

44:32.921 --> 44:34.172
What do you know
about that guy?

44:34.381 --> 44:37.258
Just that
he's an artist. A bad one.

44:39.344 --> 44:40.929
I know.
I've seen his work.

44:42.305 --> 44:44.724
What about the rest of you?
Any boyfriends?

44:45.183 --> 44:47.018
Paige, for example?

44:51.648 --> 44:54.609
The short answer is no.

44:56.611 --> 44:57.862
What about you?

44:58.738 --> 45:00.407
Uh, sort of.

45:00.573 --> 45:02.075
But I've known him
awhile.

45:02.492 --> 45:03.660
Meaning what?

45:03.952 --> 45:06.579
Meaning, we used to work
at the same paper.

45:06.788 --> 45:08.123
He covers the Giants.

45:08.331 --> 45:10.750
His mother's a lawyer.
His father's a teacher.

45:10.917 --> 45:12.669
They're from Seattle.

45:13.586 --> 45:14.587
<i>How's that?</i>

45:17.382 --> 45:18.633
What about you?

45:19.300 --> 45:20.677
I have a boyfriend.

45:20.844 --> 45:24.055
But I can guarantee you
he's not Jeremy Melton.

45:24.556 --> 45:26.307
Why don't you
let me decide?

45:27.350 --> 45:29.894
His name's Campbell,
and he's very smart,

45:30.061 --> 45:32.439
and he's starting
his own internet venture.

45:32.605 --> 45:34.274
And how long
have you known him?

45:34.482 --> 45:35.442
A month.

45:35.608 --> 45:37.068
<i>And where
did you meet him?</i>

45:38.111 --> 45:42.490
At yoga, but it's a very
exclusive gym, okay?

45:43.992 --> 45:46.286
Wait, I thought you said

45:46.453 --> 45:48.580
that Campbell
was staying with you.

45:49.038 --> 45:50.999
Well, he is,
but, you know,

45:51.166 --> 45:53.334
his roommate didn't
pay the rent, so--

45:53.543 --> 45:55.795
Dorothy, you met this
guy a month ago,

45:55.962 --> 45:57.881
and he's staying
with you?

45:58.423 --> 46:00.300
<i>Excuse me, Paige,
but there have been guys</i>

46:00.467 --> 46:01.718
<i>whose last names
you didn't know</i>

46:01.885 --> 46:03.178
that you let
into your pants.

46:03.344 --> 46:05.388
I'm just letting
this guy into my house.

46:05.805 --> 46:07.557
Well you don't have
to be bitchy.

46:07.724 --> 46:08.725
Fine!

46:10.143 --> 46:12.937
So, while we're on
the topic, Dorothy,

46:13.188 --> 46:14.939
what is Campbell's
last name?

46:21.821 --> 46:25.200
You know, that's it.
This is bullshit.

46:25.408 --> 46:27.410
And I don't have to
answer these questions.

46:28.369 --> 46:29.621
I'll see you guys later.

46:35.627 --> 46:36.711
That went well.

46:39.380 --> 46:41.424
- I gotta go.
- Me too.

46:43.051 --> 46:45.053
Paige, actually, I'd like
you to stay a moment.

46:45.220 --> 46:48.973
Uh-oh.
am I in trouble, Detective?

46:49.140 --> 46:50.683
You want to
interrogate me?

46:50.850 --> 46:52.310
It'll just take
a second.

46:54.062 --> 46:54.896
Talk later?

46:55.063 --> 46:56.815
<i>Sure, if I'm not
under arrest.</i>

47:05.156 --> 47:06.658
Please, take a seat.

47:18.378 --> 47:20.004
So, Paige, what are we
gonna do about this?

47:20.463 --> 47:22.173
I thought
that was your job.

47:22.549 --> 47:24.676
You're the
detective, right?

47:25.134 --> 47:26.886
I'm not talking about
the case, Paige.

47:27.053 --> 47:28.096
Don't be coy.

47:28.429 --> 47:29.973
I'm talking about this.

47:31.641 --> 47:32.600
This?

47:32.767 --> 47:33.893
Tension.

47:34.310 --> 47:35.645
The tension?

47:39.190 --> 47:41.150
The sexual tension.

47:42.443 --> 47:43.695
Let's be frank.

47:47.198 --> 47:48.867
Detective Vaughn.

47:49.325 --> 47:52.036
Please remove your hand
from my thigh.

47:52.745 --> 47:54.080
All right.

47:54.247 --> 47:56.165
Where would you
like me to put it?

47:56.958 --> 47:58.626
How about
up your ass?

48:00.211 --> 48:01.796
Have a good day.

48:08.553 --> 48:10.430
So you'll get
back to me on that.

48:35.413 --> 48:36.998
Who the fuck are you?

48:41.252 --> 48:42.879
It's not what it
looks like, brother.

48:43.212 --> 48:46.049
Okay? Take it easy.
I am not well.

48:54.015 --> 48:56.267
Aah!

49:06.194 --> 49:07.320
Here you go.

49:15.662 --> 49:17.413
Hey, Happy
Valentine's Day.

49:17.580 --> 49:19.123
Happy Valentine's Day.

49:19.290 --> 49:20.416
I came by to
drop off gifts.

49:20.583 --> 49:21.542
I would have been
here earlier,

49:21.709 --> 49:22.877
but I spent most
of the afternoon

49:23.044 --> 49:24.212
talking to
that detective.

49:24.712 --> 49:26.631
It was very
romantic, actually.

49:26.965 --> 49:28.341
I wanted to explain
about that.

49:28.508 --> 49:29.592
Nothing to explain.

49:29.759 --> 49:31.386
He's just talking to as
many people as possible.

49:31.552 --> 49:33.638
Kate, don't worry
about it.

49:33.846 --> 49:36.516
Listen, do you need a date
for Dorothy's party tonight?

49:37.433 --> 49:38.518
Come on, you
don't want to go

49:38.685 --> 49:40.311
to a Valentine's
party alone.

49:41.396 --> 49:42.522
True.

49:43.773 --> 49:45.233
So where's my gift?

49:51.823 --> 49:53.324
<i>I picked it out
myself.</i>

49:53.866 --> 49:55.201
Very cute.

49:56.285 --> 49:57.704
I got you
something, too.

50:02.542 --> 50:04.210
Oh, you got
my suit cleaned.

50:04.377 --> 50:05.420
Turn around.

50:13.928 --> 50:15.722
"IOU...TLC."

50:15.888 --> 50:19.475
That is outstanding.
Love that.

50:20.184 --> 50:21.769
Can't get that
at the mall.

50:21.936 --> 50:22.937
No.

50:27.191 --> 50:28.026
Bye.

51:00.308 --> 51:02.018
What the hell
are you doing?

51:02.226 --> 51:03.853
What are you
doing here?

51:04.145 --> 51:06.105
Detective Vaughn
is a disgusting,

51:06.272 --> 51:07.482
lecherous scumbag.

51:07.607 --> 51:08.566
What happened?

51:08.733 --> 51:10.943
After you left, he put
his hand on my thigh.

51:11.235 --> 51:12.320
Did you ask him to?

51:12.487 --> 51:14.572
What do you think?

51:14.739 --> 51:16.032
I don't know.

51:19.660 --> 51:20.661
Hello.

51:20.828 --> 51:21.662
<i>It's Dorothy.</i>

51:21.829 --> 51:23.998
Uh, hold on, Dorothy.
Paige is here, too.

51:26.501 --> 51:27.877
Hey, Dorothy.

51:28.127 --> 51:30.671
Kate nearly clubbed me
on the head with an iron.

51:30.838 --> 51:32.673
They came for Campbell.

51:33.216 --> 51:35.218
<i>Yeah, I know.
they questioned Adam, too.</i>

51:35.384 --> 51:36.928
<i>Listen, Kate,
did they call Adam,</i>

51:37.095 --> 51:39.222
or did they question him
for two hours?

51:39.388 --> 51:41.099
'Cause now they've
requested that Campbell

51:41.265 --> 51:42.642
not leave town
for a few days.

51:42.809 --> 51:44.477
<i>It's humiliating.</i>

51:45.978 --> 51:47.688
Did you give
Vaughn his name?

51:47.980 --> 51:48.898
No.

51:49.107 --> 51:50.525
<i>Well, then,
how did he get it?</i>

51:50.691 --> 51:52.777
He's a detective.

51:53.152 --> 51:55.363
<i>You know, you go back
and forth about Adam--</i>

51:55.571 --> 51:57.115
<i>"should I or shouldn't I?"</i>

51:57.323 --> 51:58.866
Campbell's all I've got.

51:59.200 --> 52:01.744
<i>I don't feel like being dumped
before my party, Kate.</i>

52:01.911 --> 52:03.579
Come on, Dorothy,
just hang up the phone

52:03.746 --> 52:05.998
and make it up to the guy
if he's so upset.

52:06.290 --> 52:07.375
<i>What do you mean?</i>

52:08.876 --> 52:10.711
Use your imagination.

52:10.878 --> 52:12.547
Thanks, Paige.

52:12.713 --> 52:14.048
<i>you're welcome.</i>

52:17.009 --> 52:19.262
She's so ridiculous.

52:20.263 --> 52:22.056
Do you need
instructions?

52:22.306 --> 52:24.016
<i>It's detective
Vaughn, Kate.</i>

52:28.020 --> 52:29.522
Uh, sorry, Detective.

52:29.689 --> 52:31.566
Uh, good news.
We picked up Marquette.

52:31.732 --> 52:34.443
<i>Oh. So does this mean
that it's Jeremy?</i>

52:34.610 --> 52:36.112
Well, we haven't started
the questioning yet.

52:36.279 --> 52:37.446
<i>But if it isn't Melton,</i>

52:37.613 --> 52:38.906
you're gonna keep
looking, right?

52:39.073 --> 52:40.825
<i>We're gonna keep pursuing
every angle on this thing.</i>

52:40.992 --> 52:43.452
Meantime, be careful.
Stay with your friends.

52:43.661 --> 52:45.538
I'll let you know
when I've got more.

52:46.664 --> 52:47.874
Thank you, Detective.

52:50.251 --> 52:51.335
Well?

52:52.879 --> 52:54.046
Picked up Marquette.

53:00.511 --> 53:02.597
- What do we have here?
- Hey.

53:03.181 --> 53:05.683
The plan is to have this
up and running by tonight.

53:09.770 --> 53:11.522
I'm sorry about
this morning.

53:11.772 --> 53:13.608
Oh, just don't even
worry about it.

53:13.774 --> 53:15.526
Really,
it's not a big deal.

53:17.904 --> 53:18.946
Uh...

53:20.198 --> 53:21.574
Happy Valentine's Day.

53:21.741 --> 53:23.576
Oh. Dorothy, what--

53:25.036 --> 53:26.370
I had no idea
we were exchanging.

53:26.579 --> 53:29.373
Really, I'm embarrassed.
Do I have--do I open it?

53:29.540 --> 53:30.666
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

53:34.378 --> 53:35.338
Put it on.

53:38.132 --> 53:39.258
Wow.

53:43.137 --> 53:44.388
<i>You like it?</i>

53:45.223 --> 53:46.766
Do I like it?
What are you--

53:47.808 --> 53:49.477
- Dorothy, I love it.
- Yeah?

54:05.451 --> 54:09.205
♪ I guess the honeymoon
is over ♪

54:11.457 --> 54:15.253

54:43.406 --> 54:44.448
Now it's my turn.

54:52.498 --> 54:53.582
<i>Wow.</i>

54:54.792 --> 54:56.252
It's so beautiful.

55:00.631 --> 55:02.967
- Thank you.
- Mmm. Yeah.

55:03.134 --> 55:05.094
So, listen, I have
that investor meeting.

55:05.261 --> 55:06.137
But--you're leaving?

55:06.304 --> 55:07.680
Well, just,
you know, for drinks.

55:07.847 --> 55:09.432
It'll be an hour, tops.

55:09.640 --> 55:11.642
But you have the militant
Millicent here,

55:11.809 --> 55:13.728
and she's got her army
of caterers and workmen,

55:13.894 --> 55:16.522
so I think
you'll be just fine.

55:16.689 --> 55:18.024
Yeah, I guess.

55:18.190 --> 55:19.442
All right.

55:20.443 --> 55:23.988
Well, uh, do you
care to join me now?

55:24.238 --> 55:28.075
Uh, it's tempting,
tempting, but, um...

55:28.326 --> 55:31.746
I want to get a quick workout
in before my meeting, okay?

55:31.912 --> 55:35.458
But I promise you I will be
back before the party, okay?

55:48.763 --> 55:53.768
Evan Wheeler,
account number 3165936.

55:53.934 --> 55:56.228
Look, we've been over this
three times already.

55:57.104 --> 55:59.190
And I realize
it's the entire account.

56:00.524 --> 56:04.236
February 16, 1940.

56:04.528 --> 56:07.823
Sather.

56:07.990 --> 56:09.367
Any other questions?

56:12.036 --> 56:16.040
Uh...San Francisco.

56:17.208 --> 56:18.417
What's that?

56:19.210 --> 56:20.795
Look, don't tell me
where the fuck I was born.

56:20.961 --> 56:22.713
Just transfer
the goddamn funds.

56:24.131 --> 56:25.508
<i>Campbell?</i>

56:26.634 --> 56:27.885
<i>Campbell?</i>

56:28.052 --> 56:29.887
Fuckin'...

56:32.056 --> 56:33.182
Yes, Dorothy?

56:34.100 --> 56:35.851
<i>We just lost the hot
water in the main house.</i>

56:36.018 --> 56:37.103
<i>Could you do me
a big favor</i>

56:37.269 --> 56:39.397
<i>and relight the pilot
in the basement?</i>

56:42.149 --> 56:44.610
Uh, yeah, yeah, sure.
That's no problem.

56:44.902 --> 56:47.321
Fuckin' perfect.
Now I'm on the staff.

57:01.544 --> 57:02.545
<i>Perfect.</i>

57:33.784 --> 57:34.702
Great.

57:38.372 --> 57:39.331
Damn it!

57:44.378 --> 57:46.380
Fucking perfect.

57:49.425 --> 57:50.676
Great.

58:09.987 --> 58:11.572
Shit.

58:24.460 --> 58:25.169
Yeah.

58:33.093 --> 58:35.012
Think that's worth
at least a Porsche?

58:36.514 --> 58:37.515
Yeah.

58:41.393 --> 58:42.311
Shit!

58:43.521 --> 58:45.147
Aah!

58:49.985 --> 58:52.738
<i>I'll get you one too!</i>

59:08.546 --> 59:10.089
There you are!
Excuse me.

59:10.798 --> 59:12.591
- There you are.
- Hey.

59:12.758 --> 59:14.593
Hey, any luck
finding a date tonight?

59:14.760 --> 59:17.137
I'm playing phone tag
with Brian.

59:17.304 --> 59:19.098
- Who?
- Brian?

59:19.265 --> 59:21.308
Remember the guy
from turbo dating?

59:21.475 --> 59:22.268
Oh, right.

59:22.434 --> 59:23.561
Well, I'm gonna
go look around.

59:23.727 --> 59:25.354
Okay, have fun.

59:34.822 --> 59:35.656
Hey.

59:39.076 --> 59:40.452
Still no Campbell?

59:41.245 --> 59:42.288
Nope.

59:42.830 --> 59:46.375
Well, it's only 11:00.

59:47.626 --> 59:49.795
He said he'd be here
before the party.

59:51.839 --> 59:53.382
I'm not an idiot, Kate.

59:53.549 --> 59:55.301
I know when I'm
being dumped, okay?

59:55.467 --> 59:57.052
You're not getting
dumped, Dorth.

59:57.219 --> 59:58.137
Right.

59:58.304 --> 59:59.805
Happy Valentine's Day,
ladies.

59:59.972 --> 1:00:01.181
Hey, Adam.

1:00:01.348 --> 1:00:02.308
Hey.

1:00:02.474 --> 1:00:04.101
- Mmm.
- Oh.

1:00:04.268 --> 1:00:06.061
- You look great.
- So do you.

1:00:06.228 --> 1:00:08.272
Yeah, you look great.

1:00:08.439 --> 1:00:09.732
Nice party, Dorothy.

1:00:09.898 --> 1:00:11.025
It blows.

1:00:12.651 --> 1:00:13.652
Everything okay?

1:00:13.986 --> 1:00:17.990
Oh, yeah, everything's fine.
It's just that men suck.

1:00:18.365 --> 1:00:20.659
Oh, that's no offense
to you, Adam.

1:00:21.535 --> 1:00:22.870
None taken.

1:00:27.416 --> 1:00:30.210
Yeah, okay.
Excuse me. Ahem.

1:00:30.377 --> 1:00:33.005
He'll get here,
Dorth. Don't worry.

1:00:37.635 --> 1:00:38.677
Don't ask.

1:00:42.931 --> 1:00:44.642
<i>Listen, you doing
anything later on?</i>

1:00:44.808 --> 1:00:46.685
Uh, actually,
I'm busy.

1:00:46.977 --> 1:00:48.854
I'm gonna hook up
with some young stud,

1:00:49.063 --> 1:00:50.022
get a little action.

1:00:50.189 --> 1:00:51.148
- Really?
- Mmm.

1:00:51.315 --> 1:00:52.941
Sounds good.
Anyone I know?

1:00:53.192 --> 1:00:54.151
Well, you know,
I'm young...

1:00:54.318 --> 1:00:55.402
reasonably
good-looking...

1:00:55.569 --> 1:00:56.987
it shouldn't be
that difficult

1:00:57.154 --> 1:00:59.156
finding volunteers.

1:01:02.785 --> 1:01:03.869
<i>Hmm...</i>

1:01:04.912 --> 1:01:06.121
Yeah, you'll do.

1:01:24.264 --> 1:01:25.557
Hey, hot stuff.

1:01:27.184 --> 1:01:28.310
You came.

1:01:30.270 --> 1:01:31.772
I like how you move.

1:01:32.523 --> 1:01:33.857
Why don't you join me?

1:01:42.825 --> 1:01:43.909
Wow.

1:01:46.036 --> 1:01:47.246
You know...

1:01:49.832 --> 1:01:52.042
I'd much rather
take you upstairs.

1:02:01.343 --> 1:02:02.970
What's upstairs?

1:02:04.763 --> 1:02:06.515
Something I want
to show you.

1:02:07.725 --> 1:02:09.059
It's a surprise.

1:02:11.270 --> 1:02:13.230
I love surprises.

1:02:36.086 --> 1:02:37.087
So...

1:02:37.463 --> 1:02:38.589
So?

1:02:39.798 --> 1:02:40.799
Mmm.

1:02:42.259 --> 1:02:43.844
We're upstairs now.

1:02:44.303 --> 1:02:45.763
Yes, we are.

1:02:47.514 --> 1:02:49.141
You got a surprise
for me?

1:02:57.775 --> 1:02:59.151
Yes, I do.

1:03:13.707 --> 1:03:14.833
Surprise.

1:03:18.545 --> 1:03:21.548
You brought me up here
to show me your penis.

1:03:21.799 --> 1:03:24.676
Aw, that's so sweet.

1:03:30.224 --> 1:03:31.225
Well?

1:03:35.312 --> 1:03:36.730
What are you
waiting for, honey?

1:03:37.689 --> 1:03:38.857
Wax it.

1:03:39.566 --> 1:03:41.527
Oh, you're unbelievable.

1:03:41.693 --> 1:03:44.613
Paige, Paige, Paige,
Paige, come here.

1:03:44.905 --> 1:03:47.741
Relax, okay?
It'll be fun.

1:03:52.120 --> 1:03:55.541
All right.
Take off your shirt.

1:03:56.250 --> 1:03:57.501
All right.

1:04:11.014 --> 1:04:12.724
Don't forget your pants.

1:04:23.151 --> 1:04:24.945
Now lay down.

1:04:37.249 --> 1:04:38.250
What are you doing?

1:04:39.543 --> 1:04:42.045
Never mind.
It's a surprise.

1:04:57.185 --> 1:04:58.312
I knew it.

1:04:58.896 --> 1:04:59.855
Knew what?

1:05:00.647 --> 1:05:03.734
The first time I saw you,
I knew you were kinky, Paige.

1:05:10.741 --> 1:05:13.201
You still want me
to wax it?

1:05:13.368 --> 1:05:15.412
Yes, I do.

1:05:21.168 --> 1:05:24.171
♪ Now I feel like
a baby...who has ♪

1:05:24.338 --> 1:05:26.757
♪ just opened its eyes ♪

1:05:26.924 --> 1:05:29.426
Ow! Oh, my--

1:05:30.177 --> 1:05:32.012
Oh...God!

1:05:32.137 --> 1:05:33.221
<i>Paige.</i>

1:05:33.388 --> 1:05:35.307
Bitch! Oh!

1:05:42.147 --> 1:05:43.482
This party sucks.

1:05:43.649 --> 1:05:45.484
Things didn't go well
with Brian, I take it?

1:05:45.651 --> 1:05:46.360
Mmm.

1:05:47.319 --> 1:05:48.654
Oh, my God.

1:05:53.492 --> 1:05:54.534
This is
a private party.

1:05:54.743 --> 1:05:56.495
Get your little paws
off me!

1:05:56.662 --> 1:05:58.038
What is she doing here?

1:05:58.246 --> 1:05:59.748
She was just leaving,
Dorothy.

1:05:59.915 --> 1:06:02.292
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
That's my necklace!

1:06:02.459 --> 1:06:03.835
What are you
talking about?

1:06:04.002 --> 1:06:05.003
Campbell gave this
to me.

1:06:05.170 --> 1:06:06.546
And what are you
supposed to be,

1:06:06.713 --> 1:06:08.090
his Valentine?

1:06:08.256 --> 1:06:09.424
I don't think so, sweetie,

1:06:09.591 --> 1:06:11.468
'cause that necklace
was stolen from me

1:06:11.635 --> 1:06:13.887
along with half
of the rest of my jewelry.

1:06:15.347 --> 1:06:16.974
Hurts, doesn't it?

1:06:18.517 --> 1:06:19.851
He loves me.

1:06:21.812 --> 1:06:24.272
He loves your trust fund.

1:06:25.816 --> 1:06:26.692
Trust me.

1:06:26.858 --> 1:06:28.402
Okay, time to go.

1:06:28.568 --> 1:06:29.820
Watch the jacket!

1:06:32.155 --> 1:06:33.240
Bye-bye.

1:06:38.412 --> 1:06:40.831
Now this party
officially sucks.

1:06:40.998 --> 1:06:42.207
No kidding.

1:06:44.501 --> 1:06:46.086
Where are you going?

1:06:46.253 --> 1:06:47.587
To chill out.

1:06:53.677 --> 1:06:54.803
Hello again.

1:06:57.764 --> 1:06:58.598
Hey.

1:06:58.765 --> 1:06:59.891
Hey, wait a minute.

1:07:00.350 --> 1:07:01.601
Where are you
running off to?

1:07:01.768 --> 1:07:03.061
What do you want, Max?

1:07:03.603 --> 1:07:05.230
Easy, sweetness.

1:07:05.605 --> 1:07:07.816
I just wanted to know
if you've seen Lily yet.

1:07:08.191 --> 1:07:09.067
She's in L.A.,

1:07:09.234 --> 1:07:10.777
and don't
call me sweetness.

1:07:11.653 --> 1:07:14.322
Well, sweetness,
Lily's not in L.A.

1:07:15.407 --> 1:07:16.616
What are you
talking about?

1:07:17.701 --> 1:07:18.910
Well, I called her office,

1:07:19.077 --> 1:07:20.787
and they said
she never showed up.

1:07:21.955 --> 1:07:23.081
Are you sure?

1:07:23.623 --> 1:07:24.958
About what?

1:07:25.125 --> 1:07:27.210
Hello!
Max, about Lily.

1:07:28.211 --> 1:07:30.297
How long have you
known this?

1:07:31.548 --> 1:07:34.176
You know, you're really
at home in this outfit, girl.

1:07:35.052 --> 1:07:37.637
You just look...
just...yum.

1:07:39.139 --> 1:07:40.098
Ugh...

1:09:08.812 --> 1:09:10.522
Oh, great.

1:09:10.730 --> 1:09:12.315
What are you
supposed to be?

1:09:22.075 --> 1:09:24.119
I--I--I was just, um...

1:12:27.135 --> 1:12:28.845
No! No!

1:12:29.387 --> 1:12:31.890
Aah! No! No!

1:12:32.182 --> 1:12:33.099
Uhh!

1:12:39.356 --> 1:12:41.232
- Dorothy?
- Hmm?

1:12:41.399 --> 1:12:42.525
<i>Are you okay?</i>

1:12:42.942 --> 1:12:44.152
Yeah.

1:12:44.319 --> 1:12:45.862
Hey, listen.

1:12:46.029 --> 1:12:49.074
That Max guy said that
Lily never showed up in L.A.

1:12:49.324 --> 1:12:51.117
Have you heard anything
from her?

1:12:52.285 --> 1:12:53.203
No.

1:12:54.913 --> 1:12:56.498
But I bet Paige has.

1:12:58.875 --> 1:13:00.126
Well, do you think
he's here?

1:13:00.293 --> 1:13:01.795
- Who?
- Jeremy Melton.

1:13:01.961 --> 1:13:02.921
God, I hope not.

1:13:03.088 --> 1:13:04.422
Listen. Listen!

1:13:04.589 --> 1:13:05.548
My dad's got a gun
in his study.

1:13:05.715 --> 1:13:07.842
That's just a good way
to get us both killed.

1:13:14.891 --> 1:13:15.600
Hello?

1:13:15.767 --> 1:13:17.143
Kate, it's Detective Vaughn.

1:13:17.352 --> 1:13:18.978
Listen, we had to let
Marquette go.

1:13:19.145 --> 1:13:20.063
What do you mean?

1:13:20.230 --> 1:13:21.564
<i>I mean exactly
what I just said.</i>

1:13:21.731 --> 1:13:23.149
We didn't have enough
evidence to hold him.

1:13:23.316 --> 1:13:25.443
He could be anywhere--
like your party, for example.

1:13:25.610 --> 1:13:27.362
What? Wh-what happened?

1:13:27.612 --> 1:13:29.656
Um, listen, Detective,
our friend Lily

1:13:29.823 --> 1:13:31.282
never showed up
in L.A.

1:13:31.658 --> 1:13:33.618
Stay put. Stay in groups.
I'm on my way.

1:13:38.164 --> 1:13:39.082
What?

1:13:39.249 --> 1:13:40.792
They had to let
Marquette go.

1:13:41.626 --> 1:13:43.086
So now they've got
nothing?

1:13:43.670 --> 1:13:44.712
Come on.

1:13:55.640 --> 1:13:57.517
Which one of
the 12 steps is this?

1:13:58.101 --> 1:14:00.520
Kate.
There you are.

1:14:00.728 --> 1:14:03.231
You know, I've been looking
all over for you.

1:14:04.065 --> 1:14:06.025
And I wasn't at the bottom
of the bottle?

1:14:16.619 --> 1:14:17.454
Kate.

1:14:18.496 --> 1:14:20.623
Kate, come on.
Kate, don't be mad.

1:14:20.790 --> 1:14:22.083
It's Valentine's Day.

1:14:22.250 --> 1:14:23.793
Get away from me!

1:16:11.359 --> 1:16:12.402
Hello.

1:16:14.696 --> 1:16:15.738
<i>Hello.</i>

1:16:18.283 --> 1:16:20.493
Does someone
want to be my Valentine?

1:16:23.621 --> 1:16:24.539
Come on.

1:16:32.839 --> 1:16:33.840
Hello.

1:16:37.969 --> 1:16:39.095
Come on.

1:16:44.058 --> 1:16:45.310
Come on.

1:16:51.858 --> 1:16:52.942
Brian.

1:16:55.987 --> 1:16:58.114
All right,
get the fuck out.

1:17:32.607 --> 1:17:33.483
Ah!

1:17:33.650 --> 1:17:35.902
Get your hands off of me!

1:17:36.069 --> 1:17:37.528
Oh, God!

1:17:37.695 --> 1:17:38.488
Stop!

1:17:48.581 --> 1:17:49.582
Help!

1:17:49.749 --> 1:17:52.001
Somebody, please help me!

1:17:56.673 --> 1:17:59.217
Ah! Somebody help me!

1:18:01.511 --> 1:18:02.345
<i>Help!</i>

1:18:02.679 --> 1:18:03.680
<i>Someone!</i>

1:18:05.640 --> 1:18:06.683
Aaah!

1:18:06.849 --> 1:18:08.726
Uh! No!

1:18:10.520 --> 1:18:11.813
Aah!

1:18:13.189 --> 1:18:14.732
Aah!

1:18:15.733 --> 1:18:16.567
Oh!

1:18:18.319 --> 1:18:19.320
No!

1:18:28.246 --> 1:18:29.622
Aah!

1:18:30.206 --> 1:18:33.418
Wah! Aah!

1:18:35.378 --> 1:18:36.796
Aah!

1:18:56.733 --> 1:18:58.109
<i>- Kate?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1:18:58.276 --> 1:19:00.862
Hey, Kate...
shit, we blew a fuse.

1:19:02.238 --> 1:19:05.116
<i>Come on,
grab Stephanie and let's go.</i>

1:19:08.828 --> 1:19:11.038
Jesus, this place
cleared out fast.

1:19:11.247 --> 1:19:12.373
Where the hell
is Paige?

1:19:12.540 --> 1:19:13.458
Oh, she's probably
in a hot tub.

1:19:13.624 --> 1:19:15.168
she always ends up
in the hot tub

1:19:15.334 --> 1:19:16.461
at these parties.

1:19:17.879 --> 1:19:19.005
Where's Adam?

1:19:19.172 --> 1:19:21.174
I don't know.
Did you check the wine cellar?

1:19:22.592 --> 1:19:24.093
Could be him,
you know?

1:19:24.761 --> 1:19:26.012
What could be him?

1:19:28.431 --> 1:19:30.892
Oh, come on, Dorothy.

1:19:31.058 --> 1:19:33.895
No, no, no. don't
"come on, Dorothy" me.

1:19:34.437 --> 1:19:35.605
Why the hell not?

1:19:36.939 --> 1:19:39.400
Because I know Adam.

1:19:40.985 --> 1:19:43.571
Okay, fine--he's no angel,
but he's not a murderer.

1:19:43.738 --> 1:19:45.198
Well, you didn't know
he was an alcoholic

1:19:45.406 --> 1:19:47.366
when you first met him,
either, did you?

1:19:48.826 --> 1:19:51.037
I'm just saying I don't know
if I trust your judgment.

1:19:51.204 --> 1:19:52.205
That's enough.

1:19:52.371 --> 1:19:53.498
Come on, Kate--

1:19:53.664 --> 1:19:55.166
with a little working out
and, I don't know,

1:19:55.333 --> 1:19:57.126
some plastic surgery,
why couldn't Jeremy Melton

1:19:57.293 --> 1:19:58.961
become Adam Carr?

1:19:59.629 --> 1:20:01.380
Okay, fine.
then by the same logic,

1:20:01.547 --> 1:20:03.633
why couldn't Jeremy Melton
be Campbell?

1:20:03.800 --> 1:20:04.842
You--

1:20:06.719 --> 1:20:08.054
should take that back.

1:20:11.140 --> 1:20:14.352
Look, Dorothy,
I'm not saying it's true.

1:20:14.519 --> 1:20:17.355
I'm just saying if we're going
to be pointing fingers here...

1:20:17.605 --> 1:20:20.441
I mean, you heard what
that Ruthie woman said.

1:20:20.775 --> 1:20:23.152
And how well
do you really know Campbell?

1:20:23.319 --> 1:20:25.822
I mean, you don't even know
his last name, for God's sake.

1:20:29.200 --> 1:20:31.494
You really can't stand it,
can you?

1:20:31.661 --> 1:20:32.995
Can't stand what?

1:20:33.162 --> 1:20:36.165
That I found someone just
as good as your boyfriend...

1:20:36.374 --> 1:20:40.086
just as smart
and just as good-looking.

1:20:40.336 --> 1:20:41.546
That's ridiculous.

1:20:41.712 --> 1:20:43.422
I mean, why--
I mean, why should I--

1:20:43.589 --> 1:20:46.801
why should the fat girl
get a turn, huh?

1:20:46.968 --> 1:20:49.136
- What?
- Oh, come on, Kate.

1:20:49.345 --> 1:20:51.097
You've always been
the popular one,

1:20:51.264 --> 1:20:52.890
and Shelley was always
the brainy one,

1:20:53.057 --> 1:20:54.267
and Lily was
the fun one,

1:20:54.433 --> 1:20:55.768
and Paige was
the sexy one,

1:20:55.935 --> 1:20:58.855
and I was
the big, fat one.

1:20:59.480 --> 1:21:00.731
And as far as
you're concerned,

1:21:00.898 --> 1:21:03.109
that's exactly
the way that it is.

1:21:03.693 --> 1:21:04.944
Well, you know what?

1:21:06.445 --> 1:21:08.239
Screw all of you!

1:21:13.035 --> 1:21:15.663
<i>Dorothy, come back.</i>

1:21:16.664 --> 1:21:17.623
<i>Come on.</i>

1:21:44.233 --> 1:21:46.027
Come on, Vaughn.

1:22:43.417 --> 1:22:46.003
<i>This is Detective
Leon Vaughn, S.F.P.D.</i>

1:22:46.170 --> 1:22:47.964
<i>Leave a message.</i>

1:22:54.845 --> 1:22:55.888
Aaah!

1:22:56.514 --> 1:22:57.515
Aah!

1:23:00.351 --> 1:23:02.478
Paige...Dorothy!

1:23:04.814 --> 1:23:07.858
Paige...Dorothy!

1:23:48.691 --> 1:23:49.608
Hi.

1:23:56.198 --> 1:23:57.324
It's you.

1:23:59.076 --> 1:24:00.119
It's me.

1:24:00.327 --> 1:24:01.579
<i>You're still here.</i>

1:24:03.122 --> 1:24:04.415
I'm still here.

1:24:05.374 --> 1:24:06.208
I heard a noise.

1:24:06.375 --> 1:24:08.252
I thought something might
have happened to Dorothy.

1:24:11.005 --> 1:24:12.548
Dorothy's a big girl.

1:24:14.967 --> 1:24:16.177
What do you mean?

1:24:16.469 --> 1:24:18.179
Dance with me, Kate.

1:24:18.596 --> 1:24:20.431
No, Adam, I just want
to find Dorothy.

1:24:20.598 --> 1:24:21.891
I'm asking you nicely.

1:24:23.017 --> 1:24:24.393
Dance with me.

1:24:32.777 --> 1:24:34.361
Don't make me beg, Kate.

1:24:35.237 --> 1:24:36.405
Please.

1:24:42.453 --> 1:24:43.621
You know...

1:24:47.917 --> 1:24:49.502
I screwed up, Kate.

1:24:51.837 --> 1:24:53.297
You had
a couple of drinks.

1:24:53.464 --> 1:24:54.799
It's not the end
of the world.

1:24:54.965 --> 1:24:56.801
No, you're disappointed.

1:24:59.178 --> 1:25:01.222
I'm just worried
that you'll hurt me.

1:25:01.972 --> 1:25:03.349
Hurt you?

1:25:04.308 --> 1:25:05.684
Hurt you?

1:25:06.185 --> 1:25:09.396
No, baby, I love you.

1:25:10.231 --> 1:25:12.817
And you're the only
good thing in my life.

1:25:13.400 --> 1:25:14.610
All these other people,

1:25:14.777 --> 1:25:17.238
they can just die
as far as I care.

1:25:18.197 --> 1:25:19.281
But you...

1:25:20.908 --> 1:25:21.909
Hey...

1:25:24.870 --> 1:25:26.664
You mean something to me.

1:25:35.131 --> 1:25:37.091
What's the matter, baby?
You're shaking.

1:25:38.926 --> 1:25:41.053
I don't want to hurt you,
either, Adam.

1:25:41.220 --> 1:25:42.721
I understand.

1:25:45.141 --> 1:25:46.183
But I will.

1:25:46.350 --> 1:25:48.853
Oh...Jesus!

1:25:49.019 --> 1:25:49.937
God.

1:25:51.814 --> 1:25:52.982
Dorothy!

1:25:54.275 --> 1:25:55.317
Dorothy!

1:25:57.862 --> 1:25:58.988
Dorothy!

1:26:10.583 --> 1:26:11.709
<i>Hello, Kate.</i>

1:26:20.634 --> 1:26:22.011
What the hell's
going on?

1:26:22.720 --> 1:26:23.929
Nothing.

1:26:26.015 --> 1:26:27.725
<i>What happened
back there?</i>

1:26:28.309 --> 1:26:29.852
I just want to talk
about this.

1:26:31.770 --> 1:26:33.105
I'm sorry.

1:26:33.689 --> 1:26:34.857
I guess I was just
a little upset

1:26:35.024 --> 1:26:36.108
<i>about the drinking.</i>

1:26:36.734 --> 1:26:38.569
I mean,
you were doing so well.

1:26:38.736 --> 1:26:39.820
- Kate!
- Aah!

1:26:40.237 --> 1:26:41.572
- Kate!
- Aah!

1:26:41.739 --> 1:26:42.948
- Kate!
- Aah!

1:26:47.995 --> 1:26:49.121
Paige!

1:26:59.131 --> 1:27:00.925
Why do you want
to hurt me like that?

1:27:01.800 --> 1:27:04.345
I love you.
I always loved you.

1:27:07.556 --> 1:27:08.766
Stay away from me.

1:27:08.933 --> 1:27:10.392
Oh, come on, Kate.

1:27:10.601 --> 1:27:12.102
- Ah!
- Aah!

1:27:15.356 --> 1:27:16.232
Aah!

1:27:42.424 --> 1:27:43.384
Aah!

1:27:46.011 --> 1:27:46.845
shit.

1:27:47.221 --> 1:27:48.222
Shit.

1:29:21.482 --> 1:29:23.567
Aaah!

1:29:44.338 --> 1:29:45.130
Aaah!

1:29:54.515 --> 1:29:55.766
Adam, I'm sorry!

1:29:55.933 --> 1:29:56.767
It's all right.

1:29:56.934 --> 1:29:59.269
I'm so, so sorry.

1:29:59.478 --> 1:30:01.772
It's all right,
It's over.

1:30:03.524 --> 1:30:04.817
It's over.

1:30:06.527 --> 1:30:07.277
No, don't go near it!

1:30:07.444 --> 1:30:09.988
It's all right.
It's okay, all right?

1:30:28.924 --> 1:30:30.134
Dorothy.

1:30:46.108 --> 1:30:48.610
Hey, don't look at her.

1:31:08.088 --> 1:31:09.756
It's at the top
of the street on the right.

1:31:09.923 --> 1:31:11.008
Please hurry.

1:31:19.975 --> 1:31:21.477
Police are on their way.

1:31:22.978 --> 1:31:24.771
I don't understand.

1:31:26.023 --> 1:31:28.567
A few weeks ago,
she was so happy...

1:31:29.026 --> 1:31:31.111
happier than
I'd ever seen her.

1:31:33.655 --> 1:31:34.781
It's okay.

1:31:38.785 --> 1:31:40.787
I just don't understand.

1:31:43.582 --> 1:31:44.958
All I can think is...

1:31:45.709 --> 1:31:47.336
if someone is
that lonely

1:31:48.045 --> 1:31:49.254
and that angry,

1:31:50.297 --> 1:31:51.924
then they can learn
to hide it.

1:31:52.925 --> 1:31:54.843
But inside,
it never dies.

1:31:55.427 --> 1:31:56.970
It just stays there,

1:31:57.513 --> 1:31:59.223
eats away at you...

1:32:00.307 --> 1:32:02.768
'til one day, you have to
do something about it.

1:32:04.144 --> 1:32:07.856
And we all liked her.
We were her friends.

1:32:08.065 --> 1:32:10.901
Sometimes that's
not enough, I guess.

1:32:15.197 --> 1:32:17.783
I am so sorry
for the way I was before.

1:32:17.991 --> 1:32:19.868
None of that
matters now.

1:32:21.495 --> 1:32:23.080
I love you, Adam.

1:32:23.705 --> 1:32:25.165
I love you, Kate.

1:32:29.920 --> 1:32:31.588
