01:39.466 --> 01:41.534
Sorry, Henry.

01:43.470 --> 01:47.540
I can't keep you here anymore.

01:49.175 --> 01:53.379
I promise I tried my best.

01:55.181 --> 01:58.118
I'm sorry.

02:58.878 --> 03:00.813
Wanna do some drugs?

03:14.661 --> 03:16.646
Done with that?

03:16.681 --> 03:18.631
Oh, yeah, sorry.

03:18.666 --> 03:19.566
Wait.

03:24.304 --> 03:25.822
So you know this place
used to be part

03:25.857 --> 03:27.305
of a secret government
experiment?

03:27.340 --> 03:29.842
- Please don't start with
that conspiracy shit again.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.442
It's true.

03:31.477 --> 03:34.847
The government used to bring
psychotic patients out here.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.814
Used to bring them out here,

03:36.849 --> 03:39.317
take them to the
middle of the lake,

03:39.352 --> 03:42.855
and tie cinder blocks to their
feet and then push them in.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.858
And watch them
float to the bottom.

03:47.327 --> 03:49.762
You mean sink to the bottom?

03:49.797 --> 03:50.795
What did I say?

03:50.830 --> 03:53.231
You said float to the bottom.

03:53.266 --> 03:54.968
You can't float to the
bottom of anything.

03:55.003 --> 03:56.903
You can only float to the top.

03:56.938 --> 03:57.904
Now can I have that?

03:57.939 --> 03:59.237
Stop.

03:59.272 --> 04:00.607
Give it to me.

04:03.743 --> 04:07.480
- Babe, I think you
have a serious problem.

04:08.615 --> 04:12.051
- The only problem I have
is that every time we smoke,

04:12.086 --> 04:15.488
you start rambling about UFOs
and government conspiracies.

04:15.523 --> 04:16.821
No, it's true.

04:16.856 --> 04:19.492
I used to have a friend
who knew someone out here.

04:21.628 --> 04:25.965
these criminals
drugs all the time.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.899
And then murder them.

04:27.934 --> 04:31.371
And the government and
pharmacy companies paid

04:31.406 --> 04:34.005
- Can we talk about
something else?

04:34.040 --> 04:37.910
- That's why they call
this place Crazy Lake.

04:38.978 --> 04:40.913
They're all out there.

04:46.653 --> 04:49.454
- You know you're
an idiot, right?

04:49.489 --> 04:52.292
Sometimes I wonder why I
even let you see me naked.

04:52.327 --> 04:54.961
- It's 'cause we
both like tacos.

04:56.763 --> 04:59.465
So are we gonna do this?

04:59.500 --> 05:00.400
Do what?

05:04.871 --> 05:05.938
Yes, please.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.374
Wait.

05:11.544 --> 05:13.413
Let's go in the tent.

05:39.539 --> 05:40.907
- I really appreciate what
you're doing right now.

05:40.942 --> 05:42.709
Just stop talking.

08:03.616 --> 08:04.617
- Let's go see
what they're doing.

08:47.827 --> 08:48.793
I got it.

08:48.828 --> 08:51.097
What a gentleman.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.968
Don't have a suitcase?

08:57.003 --> 08:58.569
Are you gonna
have enough clothes?

08:58.604 --> 09:02.608
- Johnny, I'm only planning
on wearing bikinis.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.582
It's gonna be a good week.

09:19.191 --> 09:20.126
Kristen!

09:22.028 --> 09:23.594
Will you be honest with me?

09:23.629 --> 09:26.732
- Is one of my boobs
bigger than the other?

09:26.767 --> 09:28.966
Just tell me, I can take it.

09:29.001 --> 09:31.070
- Maybe a little, but
I think that's normal.

09:31.105 --> 09:32.172
That's not normal!

09:32.207 --> 09:33.204
Let me see yours.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.042
That's it, I'm not going.

09:36.077 --> 09:37.275
What's your deal?

09:37.310 --> 09:40.947
I feel like he's looking for
reasons to break up with me.

09:40.982 --> 09:44.584
- You don't know what it's
like being with guys like him.

09:44.619 --> 09:45.902
One second, he's
telling me he loves me,

09:45.937 --> 09:47.186
the next second,
he's telling his friends

09:47.221 --> 09:49.153
about Biggie Smalls.

09:49.188 --> 09:52.058
You're so lucky you
don't have a boyfriend.

09:52.093 --> 09:53.624
Thanks.

09:53.659 --> 09:56.329
- I mean, you totally
could if you wanted one.

09:56.364 --> 09:57.795
Uh-huh.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.365
- Can I please just
see your boobs?

09:59.400 --> 10:00.565
No.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.601
Let me see them!

10:01.636 --> 10:03.169
No!

10:04.971 --> 10:06.606
That's Tim.

10:42.274 --> 10:43.776
- How much farther,
I have to pee.

10:43.811 --> 10:45.078
We're really close.

10:45.113 --> 10:46.310
I really have to go.

10:46.345 --> 10:49.248
It's like two more miles.

10:49.283 --> 10:50.983
Can't you just...

10:52.685 --> 10:54.086
No, this is happening,
pull over.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.688
- What?
- Pull over, Mark!

10:55.723 --> 10:57.156
Babe, pull over.

11:02.061 --> 11:02.995
Move!

11:03.896 --> 11:05.698
Move, get out!

11:05.733 --> 11:06.432
Jesus!

11:14.874 --> 11:16.375
She's really fun.

11:35.094 --> 11:36.028
Hello?

11:43.369 --> 11:44.770
She might be taking a shit.

11:47.840 --> 11:51.711
- I'm gonna go make sure
she didn't pass out.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.342
You okay?

12:06.377 --> 12:07.802
Scared me!

12:07.837 --> 12:09.193
Ready to go?

12:09.228 --> 12:10.096
Wait, look at this.

12:10.131 --> 12:11.097
What is it?

12:12.198 --> 12:14.967
- I don't know,
maybe it's like a rabbit

12:15.002 --> 12:17.236
or raccoon got
killed or something.

12:17.271 --> 12:19.070
Killed by what?

12:19.105 --> 12:20.022
I don't know, Kim.

12:20.057 --> 12:21.099
Maybe a coyote.

12:21.134 --> 12:22.141
Let's just go.

12:23.476 --> 12:27.179
- Nobody said
anything about coyote!

12:36.922 --> 12:37.923
You okay?

12:39.291 --> 12:40.226
Yeah.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.800
Kristen, do you
have any service?

12:49.201 --> 12:50.803
I have one bar.

12:52.204 --> 12:54.805
Nope, I have no bars.

12:54.840 --> 12:58.477
- So, Kristen, you
excited to meet Corey?

12:58.512 --> 12:59.877
Who's Corey?

12:59.912 --> 13:01.412
You didn't tell her?

13:01.447 --> 13:03.198
- Tell me what?
- Nothing.

13:03.233 --> 13:04.675
Johnny and Mark's friend.

13:04.710 --> 13:06.083
He's gonna be at the cabin.

13:06.118 --> 13:07.520
Megan's trying to get
you guys to have sex.

13:08.921 --> 13:09.854
He's joking.

13:09.889 --> 13:12.189
No, you literally said,

13:12.224 --> 13:13.926
"I'm going to get
them to have sex."

13:13.961 --> 13:14.860
Megan.

13:15.561 --> 13:17.428
Fine, okay, I said it.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.815
But what I meant was I
just thought it'd be cool

13:19.850 --> 13:22.168
for you to have someone to
hang out with this week.

13:22.203 --> 13:23.234
It's three couples.

13:23.269 --> 13:25.437
I don't want you to be left out.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.871
I'll be fine.

13:26.906 --> 13:28.924
I was just planning on relaxing

13:28.959 --> 13:30.943
and reading a book or something.

13:34.079 --> 13:35.513
Let's get one thing straight.

13:35.548 --> 13:38.184
You can light candles or read
50 Shades whenever you want,

13:38.219 --> 13:39.886
but not this week.

13:39.921 --> 13:41.554
Not this week.

13:44.824 --> 13:45.975
Okay.

13:46.010 --> 13:47.035
Fine.

13:47.070 --> 13:48.060
Yay!

14:06.412 --> 14:08.546
What do we have here?

14:08.581 --> 14:10.583
Oh shit, what's up, my man?

14:10.618 --> 14:12.585
Glad you made it, brother.

14:12.620 --> 14:14.788
Johnny B. Hood!

14:14.823 --> 14:16.956
What's up, man?

14:20.492 --> 14:22.259
Hi. Corey.

14:22.294 --> 14:23.729
Yeah, you are.

14:23.764 --> 14:25.164
Look at that face!

14:30.236 --> 14:32.121
Hi, I'm Corey.

14:32.156 --> 14:34.006
Hi, I'm Kristen.

14:35.507 --> 14:37.943
Hi, I'm Kristen.

14:39.245 --> 14:42.581
God, I wish I
could live in this moment.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.952
I, um, like your smile.

14:49.255 --> 14:50.621
Thank you.

14:50.656 --> 14:52.191
Is it vintage?

14:52.226 --> 14:53.190
What?

14:53.225 --> 14:54.560
Is it vintage?

14:56.362 --> 14:57.296
Oh.

15:20.286 --> 15:25.291
I just wanna lay down a few
ground rules before we head in.

15:25.326 --> 15:28.311
Throw up goes in the toilet,
condoms go in the trash,

15:28.346 --> 15:31.297
and under no circumstance,
will anybody shit in the tub.

15:31.332 --> 15:33.499
- You do something
seven or eight times,

15:33.534 --> 15:35.367
you get a reputation.

15:37.136 --> 15:39.638
But other than that,
this week has no rules.

15:39.673 --> 15:42.141
Let's just have some
fun and get fucked up!

15:43.342 --> 15:44.276
Let's go!

15:50.683 --> 15:52.084
Get the key...

15:57.957 --> 15:59.291
Come on, man.

15:59.326 --> 16:00.626
I'm trying.

16:08.167 --> 16:09.568
Um, guys, guys!

16:15.274 --> 16:17.343
What do you want, man?

16:19.178 --> 16:20.179
I'm trying.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.218
Just back off, man.

16:37.129 --> 16:39.665
I don't wanna have to hurt you.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.534
It's twist.

16:43.635 --> 16:45.471
To the left, then the right.

16:51.276 --> 16:54.446
- Jesus, that was like
a frigging horror movie.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.181
Who are you, man?

16:57.416 --> 16:58.482
Name's Cyrus.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.869
What y'all doing up here?

17:00.904 --> 17:03.222
- My uncle
owned the place.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.325
- He never said nothing
about no nephew.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.758
You knew him?

17:07.792 --> 17:10.127
Manner of speaking.

17:10.162 --> 17:12.531
I look after the place
ever since he passed.

17:12.566 --> 17:14.199
God rest his soul.

17:15.134 --> 17:20.003
- Well, appreciate
the help with the door.

17:20.039 --> 17:24.242
- Have y'all accepted Jesus
Christ as your Lord and Savior?

17:25.277 --> 17:26.744
I'm a Christian.

17:29.214 --> 17:32.284
- Not dressed like
that you ain't.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.218
Babe.

17:34.319 --> 17:36.453
It's Cyrus, right?

17:36.488 --> 17:40.492
around here
that do bottle service?

17:44.596 --> 17:45.529
Cool.

17:45.564 --> 17:48.533
Y'all just stay on property.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.503
And there won't be no trouble.

17:55.074 --> 17:59.278
I'm gonna be by tomorrow to
fix some things out back.

18:06.518 --> 18:08.854
Thanks again for the door.

18:10.122 --> 18:11.423
Love you, dog.

18:11.458 --> 18:12.724
Stay black, homie.

18:23.802 --> 18:26.171
Oh, hell no, bitch.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.306
Babe!

18:29.241 --> 18:31.376
Any one but the master!

18:37.316 --> 18:39.318
Isn't this place great?

18:43.589 --> 18:44.857
You okay?

18:44.892 --> 18:46.090
Yeah.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.861
- Are you sure
this is a good idea?

18:48.896 --> 18:50.513
Yeah, this place is awesome.

18:50.548 --> 18:52.096
That guy just creeped me out

18:52.131 --> 18:54.598
and we're in
some stranger's cabin.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.768
- Jules, he's not a stranger,
and the cabin was a gift.

18:56.803 --> 19:00.539
I promise nothing bad is
gonna happen this week.

19:00.574 --> 19:01.839
Okay?

19:01.874 --> 19:03.675
It's gonna be great.

19:05.644 --> 19:06.578
Come on.

19:19.291 --> 19:20.757
I guess this is the only one.

19:20.792 --> 19:24.429
- Why don't you take it
and I'll stay on the couch.

19:24.464 --> 19:25.698
No, no, no, no, it's fine.

19:25.733 --> 19:26.897
I can sleep on the couch.

19:26.932 --> 19:28.700
Don't be crazy, just take it.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.169
I'll stay on the couch.

19:30.204 --> 19:30.834
Okay?

19:30.869 --> 19:33.405
Uh, well, we can share it.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.440
Serious?

19:34.475 --> 19:35.405
Yeah.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.059
Swap off each
night on the couch.

19:38.094 --> 19:40.679
- Oh, I thought
you meant like...

19:40.714 --> 19:41.879
We'll work it out.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.916
Um, I'll see you later.

19:46.218 --> 19:46.952
See ya.

19:54.893 --> 19:57.296
- Hey, can
you help me with this?

19:57.331 --> 19:58.230
Yeah.

20:02.568 --> 20:04.503
Kim, I'm trying.

20:04.538 --> 20:06.403
Just not happening.

20:06.438 --> 20:09.241
Think you'll
have to go without it.

20:09.276 --> 20:10.807
Nice try.

20:10.842 --> 20:12.843
I'm gonna go lay out in the sun.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.930
- You don't wanna
hang out over here?

20:14.965 --> 20:16.982
- Oh, you want me
to hang out over here?

20:17.017 --> 20:19.383
- Hell yeah.
- Yeah?

20:19.418 --> 20:21.753
- You wanna
have a little fun?

20:21.788 --> 20:23.187
- You know it.
- Yeah?

20:23.222 --> 20:25.490
- Yeah.
- Aw, too bad, babe.

20:26.658 --> 20:28.260
I don't think so.

20:29.761 --> 20:30.696
Bye.

20:36.602 --> 20:37.769
Woman, you the devil!

21:28.487 --> 21:32.291
Who wants to slip into something
a little more comfortable?

21:40.432 --> 21:41.865
What's that?

21:41.900 --> 21:44.703
- Camera.
- Ooh, take my picture?

21:49.708 --> 21:51.341
You take it?

21:51.376 --> 21:52.311
Nah, it's video.

21:52.346 --> 21:54.678
Asshole.

21:54.713 --> 21:56.782
Lucky it's waterproof.

21:58.617 --> 21:59.835
You wanna get naked?

21:59.870 --> 22:01.053
I'll make you famous.

22:01.088 --> 22:02.521
I'm okay.

22:02.556 --> 22:03.955
Okay.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.758
Think I'm gonna go down there.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.244
See what's happening.

22:08.279 --> 22:09.695
Take your time.

22:30.449 --> 22:31.383
Mike?

22:43.028 --> 22:44.828
What's wrong with you?

22:44.863 --> 22:48.031
- What?
- I saw somebody down there!

22:48.066 --> 22:51.486
- A person, I saw a person
down there, let's go!

22:51.521 --> 22:54.906
- What, no, Katie, come...
- I'll be right back!

22:54.941 --> 22:55.974
No, Katie!

22:56.808 --> 22:57.743
Katie!

23:09.955 --> 23:10.889
Katie!

25:58.590 --> 25:59.324
Come on.

26:10.135 --> 26:14.639
- 9-1-1, what is
the address of your emergency?

26:14.674 --> 26:18.677
Fuck!

26:34.826 --> 26:38.964
who has the best slide,
and losers go in the lake.

26:38.999 --> 26:40.633
Hold this, babe.

26:40.668 --> 26:42.267
Don't go yet.

26:46.371 --> 26:47.238
Babe, can you hold this?

26:47.273 --> 26:48.573
Yeah.

26:48.608 --> 26:49.874
Hey.

26:51.009 --> 26:51.943
Nice dick.

26:53.945 --> 26:54.879
Thanks.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.385
All right, I'll go first.

27:07.692 --> 27:08.760
- Six.
- Six.

27:09.894 --> 27:11.996
Go, Corey!

27:12.031 --> 27:14.099
Go, Corey!

27:22.007 --> 27:23.274
- Three.
- Five.

27:26.711 --> 27:29.781
Kristen.

27:35.353 --> 27:37.355
Come on, baby!

27:46.364 --> 27:47.797
Three.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.034
Aw, come on!

27:49.968 --> 27:52.237
Wait, here's the last part.

28:03.882 --> 28:06.116
Fuck!
- What happened, man?

28:06.151 --> 28:08.253
- God damnit, something
on the ground cut me.

28:08.288 --> 28:09.085
Where?

28:09.120 --> 28:10.855
The fuck is that?

28:13.058 --> 28:14.059
Barbwire.

28:15.193 --> 28:16.160
Babe, you're a nurse.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.093
What should he do?

28:17.128 --> 28:19.614
- Really, I'm
a dental hygienist.

28:19.649 --> 28:22.065
- We need to put
pressure on this.

28:22.100 --> 28:24.434
Megan, go inside the house,
get a towel or a rag.

28:24.469 --> 28:26.838
Kim, go with her, see if you
can find a first-aid kit.

28:26.873 --> 28:28.440
Oh shit, look, it's Dr. Quinn.

28:28.475 --> 28:30.159
Dude, fuck off!

28:30.194 --> 28:31.808
Do I need stitches?

28:31.843 --> 28:34.277
We gotta get this
cleaned up first.

28:34.312 --> 28:37.816
- Just gonna use this to
apply pressure, all right?

28:37.851 --> 28:39.518
- Dude, why the
fuck is there barbwire

28:39.553 --> 28:41.003
on the ground?
- I don't know, man!

28:41.038 --> 28:42.454
- Kim, did you
find a first-aid kit?

28:42.489 --> 28:44.139
No, I couldn't find one.

28:44.174 --> 28:45.755
Is he gonna be okay?

28:45.790 --> 28:47.058
- Corey, grab
me that bottle of vodka.

28:47.093 --> 28:48.391
- Okay.
- No!

28:48.426 --> 28:49.826
- Listen, we
have to get the dirt

28:49.861 --> 28:51.763
and bacteria out
before it gets infected.

28:51.798 --> 28:52.796
- Here.
- I don't want it!

28:52.831 --> 28:56.367
- Babe, hand me your
phone, I gotta record this.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.253
- Please, just
take me to a hospital.

28:58.288 --> 29:00.105
- No, we have to
get it cleaned now.

29:00.140 --> 29:01.871
No, don't.

29:01.906 --> 29:03.308
Someone grab his arms?

29:03.343 --> 29:04.293
No.

29:04.328 --> 29:05.243
No!

29:06.745 --> 29:08.178
Worldstar!

29:08.213 --> 29:09.881
No, no, no, no, no!

29:37.308 --> 29:38.475
How could you do this to me?

29:38.510 --> 29:40.311
You knew what
time we had to be there!

29:40.346 --> 29:42.345
Do not put this on me!

29:42.380 --> 29:44.265
- You're the one that wanted
to wait to put gas in,

29:44.300 --> 29:46.151
and now we're stuck in the
middle of fucking nowhere!

29:46.186 --> 29:47.152
It's fine, all right?

29:47.187 --> 29:48.818
Just calm down.

29:48.853 --> 29:51.790
- Don't tell me
what to do, bitch.

29:53.992 --> 29:55.526
You know what?

29:55.561 --> 29:57.061
Fuck you, Farrah!

29:58.062 --> 30:01.432
- Well, there have to be some
houses around here somewhere,

30:01.467 --> 30:02.832
so I'm going to
go and find help.

30:02.867 --> 30:06.437
You stay in the
bloody car if you want to!

30:06.472 --> 30:07.305
Fine!

30:29.961 --> 30:31.162
Lacey, wait!

30:32.430 --> 30:33.263
Lacey, wait!

30:33.298 --> 30:34.831
Bitch asked me to drive

30:34.866 --> 30:37.869
and then she
wants to give me shit.

30:38.937 --> 30:40.069
Lacey!

30:40.104 --> 30:41.472
- Just stay with
the car, Farrah!

30:44.609 --> 30:45.593
Lacey, turn around!

30:45.628 --> 30:46.803
What do you want?

30:46.838 --> 30:47.979
Lacey, please!

30:48.014 --> 30:48.947
What?

30:59.023 --> 31:00.592
- No, no, no,
please, please, please.

31:17.175 --> 31:19.043
So, how's the foot?

31:20.078 --> 31:21.079
It hurts.

31:23.081 --> 31:25.450
- You know,
technically, you did lose.

31:25.485 --> 31:26.651
Thanks, man.

31:30.088 --> 31:33.024
- So, anybody
down for some poker?

31:35.059 --> 31:35.994
I guess.

31:37.395 --> 31:41.266
- I'm sorry, who's down
for some strip poker?

31:45.136 --> 31:46.237
Definitely!

31:59.284 --> 32:02.020
- All right, things are
starting to get interesting.

32:02.055 --> 32:02.954
Kim.

32:03.621 --> 32:04.922
Kim?

32:04.957 --> 32:06.224
Kim!

32:07.058 --> 32:08.526
- What?
- It's you.

32:10.328 --> 32:11.262
Oh.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.503
Whatever, I'm out.

32:20.538 --> 32:24.175
- All right, looks like
it's just Corey and Megan.

32:30.114 --> 32:32.216
Fellas, can we have a
little powwow for a second?

32:32.251 --> 32:33.950
Hey, no cheating.

32:33.985 --> 32:34.953
Babe, it's not cheating.

32:34.988 --> 32:36.154
It's coaching.

32:38.222 --> 32:40.058
- All right,
so it's not good.

32:40.093 --> 32:41.326
What do you have?

32:41.361 --> 32:42.560
Pair of eights.

32:42.595 --> 32:43.459
Goddamn!

32:43.494 --> 32:47.498
Um, them some
sweet ass cards though.

32:48.666 --> 32:50.566
You gotta do it.

32:50.601 --> 32:53.004
- Yeah, man, I really
wanna see Megan's boobs.

32:55.239 --> 32:56.272
My bad.

32:56.307 --> 32:57.140
Nah, it's cool.

32:57.175 --> 32:58.977
They're really nice.

33:00.211 --> 33:01.577
All right.

33:01.612 --> 33:04.013
- Yeah.
- Cool, you guys ready?

33:04.048 --> 33:05.683
- Not yet.
- All right, well, hurry up.

33:05.718 --> 33:07.185
I'll get another beer.

33:07.220 --> 33:08.470
Me too.

33:08.505 --> 33:09.686
Come on.

33:09.721 --> 33:11.556
Talk to you for a second?

33:11.591 --> 33:12.488
What's up, man?

33:12.523 --> 33:14.525
Can I give you some advice?

33:14.560 --> 33:16.225
- Okay.
- All right.

33:16.260 --> 33:18.127
As you're probably
aware, very good chance

33:18.162 --> 33:22.200
that everyone in this room is
gonna see your dick tonight.

33:22.235 --> 33:23.700
Yeah, I know.

33:23.735 --> 33:25.436
- Okay, and
it's no secret that you got

33:25.471 --> 33:28.171
a little candy crush on Kristen.

33:28.206 --> 33:31.142
Depending on how this
goes, it could be very good

33:31.177 --> 33:33.309
or it could be really bad.

33:33.344 --> 33:36.781
- Look, Corey,
I've never seen your penis,

33:36.816 --> 33:38.982
sure's got a lot going for it,

33:39.017 --> 33:41.451
I just wanna make sure that
when you do present it,

33:41.486 --> 33:44.088
you're showing people the best
of what you have to offer.

33:44.123 --> 33:45.423
- So you're saying I should get
a boner...

33:45.458 --> 33:46.491
Hey-oh!

33:47.625 --> 33:49.459
Keep it down, motormouth.

33:49.494 --> 33:52.463
Look, kid, nobody's
talking about a boner here.

33:52.498 --> 33:55.433
Okay, I'm talking about
a happy middle ground.

33:55.468 --> 33:57.367
Got a little bit
of gas in the tank,

33:57.402 --> 33:59.771
but you're not slamming
your foot down on the pedal.

33:59.806 --> 34:01.270
Okay.

34:01.305 --> 34:05.410
All right, I think I
understand what you're saying.

34:05.445 --> 34:08.346
But I don't know how to do that.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.580
Corey, Corey, Corey.

34:10.614 --> 34:13.150
Those girls are hot, right?

34:13.185 --> 34:15.650
Possibly unrealistically hot.

34:15.686 --> 34:18.121
All you gotta do
is give a quick glance.

34:18.157 --> 34:20.023
Get the party started.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.425
Whatever you do, don't stare.

34:22.460 --> 34:24.161
You don't
need a noise complaint.

34:24.197 --> 34:25.596
Understand?

34:25.630 --> 34:27.081
Yep.

34:27.117 --> 34:28.498
Right.

34:28.533 --> 34:30.033
That's my boy.

34:30.068 --> 34:33.404
Go out there and put
your best dick forward.

34:33.438 --> 34:34.772
Ladies, finally ready?

34:34.806 --> 34:35.706
Uh, duh.

34:37.341 --> 34:38.742
Let's start with Corey.

34:38.777 --> 34:40.143
What do you wanna do?

34:41.779 --> 34:43.197
I'm in.

34:43.232 --> 34:44.580
Okay.

34:44.614 --> 34:47.150
Megan, what do you wanna do?

34:48.485 --> 34:49.420
I'm in.

34:50.353 --> 34:52.757
All right, moment of truth.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.094
Corey.

34:57.195 --> 34:59.197
Pair of eights.

34:59.232 --> 35:00.563
Megan?

35:00.598 --> 35:01.466
Pair of fives.

35:06.704 --> 35:09.540
Come on, babe, no hands.

35:09.575 --> 35:10.475
Okay.

35:34.899 --> 35:35.832
What was that?

35:35.867 --> 35:37.366
Was that the door?

35:37.401 --> 35:39.853
That's what it sounded like.

35:39.888 --> 35:41.564
Someone gonna get that?

35:41.599 --> 35:43.206
I'll go check it out.

35:43.241 --> 35:45.510
It's probably just carolers.

35:50.248 --> 35:54.886
- Come on, come on, come
on, come on, please open.

35:59.757 --> 36:00.825
Who is it?

36:10.768 --> 36:13.237
And behind door number one!

36:17.875 --> 36:18.809
Guys!

36:19.777 --> 36:21.345
There's no one even here.

36:57.682 --> 37:00.284
- Outside, I saw
someone out the window.

37:00.319 --> 37:02.303
- Where?
- Out there!

37:02.338 --> 37:04.288
Everyone, stay here.

37:05.690 --> 37:07.558
What are you doing?

37:10.328 --> 37:11.529
Mark, don't!

37:16.801 --> 37:18.069
What's going on?

37:18.104 --> 37:19.237
Someone's outside!

37:19.272 --> 37:20.336
What's that?

37:20.371 --> 37:21.437
It's fucked up.

37:21.472 --> 37:22.673
Wasn't there when we got here.

37:22.708 --> 37:23.739
Okay, this ends now.

37:23.774 --> 37:24.809
Wait, man, I'll come with.

37:24.844 --> 37:26.375
No.

37:26.410 --> 37:27.877
Stay here.

37:27.912 --> 37:31.649
- All right,
I'm gonna take a piss.

37:53.471 --> 37:54.372
Hello?

37:56.841 --> 37:58.442
Someone out here?

38:16.027 --> 38:18.929
- I don't know, Johnny,
but I saw someone outside!

38:18.964 --> 38:20.698
What, you don't believe me?

38:20.733 --> 38:22.398
- Huh?
- No, it's okay.

38:22.433 --> 38:25.369
- I bet that was
that creepy guy.

38:25.404 --> 38:28.271
- Megan, why
would a lonely old man

38:28.306 --> 38:30.608
wanna watch a bunch of
young, hot girls strip?

38:30.643 --> 38:33.377
Do you think before you talk?

38:35.379 --> 38:37.280
What was that?

38:37.315 --> 38:38.549
Did you shut the door?

38:38.584 --> 38:39.515
Yeah.

38:39.550 --> 38:41.052
Did you lock it?

38:41.087 --> 38:42.518
Nuh-uh.

38:42.553 --> 38:43.654
Corey, is that you?

39:10.981 --> 39:12.783
Hey, are you okay?

39:14.652 --> 39:15.586
Hello?

40:20.017 --> 40:22.486
- What?
- Did you open the front door?

40:22.521 --> 40:23.921
- No, dude,
I took a piss inside.

40:23.956 --> 40:26.389
But did you open the door?

40:26.424 --> 40:29.093
- No, dude,
I took a piss inside.

40:29.994 --> 40:31.362
Is there a problem?

40:31.397 --> 40:32.695
No, it's okay.

40:32.730 --> 40:34.632
We just thought we heard
the front door open,

40:34.667 --> 40:36.735
and we wanted to
know if it was you.

40:36.770 --> 40:38.803
- We did hear
the front door open.

40:39.737 --> 40:40.871
Well, it wasn't me.

40:40.906 --> 40:41.971
It's all right, man.

40:42.006 --> 40:46.444
- Yeah, man, hobble on over
there and see what it was.

40:46.479 --> 40:47.978
- Sit down, man,
I'll check it out.

40:48.013 --> 40:49.647
No, Corey, wait!

40:58.088 --> 40:58.988
What?

40:59.023 --> 41:02.376
Figured, uh, since I was
just out there, came back,

41:02.411 --> 41:05.729
I got a little toy, uh,
I'm good for a little bit.

41:05.764 --> 41:06.664
No?

41:07.898 --> 41:09.366
Don't worry about it, man.

41:09.401 --> 41:10.835
It's probably just Mark.

41:12.770 --> 41:14.136
What?

41:14.171 --> 41:18.042
I guarantee he doesn't
come back with a gift.

41:22.580 --> 41:25.115
So, who's up for another round?

41:28.853 --> 41:31.589
Hey, Mark, you out here, man?

41:32.256 --> 41:33.123
Mark!

41:51.242 --> 41:52.910
Mark, is that you?

41:55.613 --> 41:56.547
Mark.

44:26.764 --> 44:28.364
What are you doing?

44:28.399 --> 44:30.734
I was looking for you.

44:30.769 --> 44:31.935
What's that?

44:32.770 --> 44:36.106
- I don't know,
I found it in the crate.

44:42.913 --> 44:44.647
You okay, man?

44:44.682 --> 44:48.118
I just got out of the cold
ass lake and I get back here

44:48.153 --> 44:51.989
to find you snooping
around in my family's shit.

44:52.024 --> 44:54.091
- Dude, I think
you need to back up

44:54.126 --> 44:56.291
because I was looking for you.

44:56.326 --> 44:58.395
And then I heard a noise and
that's why I came in here.

44:58.430 --> 45:01.096
You were looking for me, huh?

45:01.131 --> 45:03.867
Did you expect
to find me in that crate?

45:03.902 --> 45:05.367
Maybe in that folder?

45:05.402 --> 45:07.154
- Well, no, but I...
- Look,

45:07.189 --> 45:08.871
I don't know you that well, man.

45:08.906 --> 45:10.674
But shit like
this isn't going to fly

45:10.709 --> 45:12.443
if you wanna
hang with us this week.

45:12.478 --> 45:14.845
Put it back.

45:16.346 --> 45:21.018
and we don't need anymore
weird shit scaring the girls.

45:21.952 --> 45:22.886
Fine.

45:40.838 --> 45:42.404
There they are.

45:42.439 --> 45:44.740
So was it that guy?

45:44.775 --> 45:46.175
No, I don't know, um...

45:46.210 --> 45:47.910
- Mark,
did you go swimming?

45:47.945 --> 45:51.448
- No, I mean, I did, but I
know tonight's been crazy,

45:51.483 --> 45:53.982
but we checked outside,
no one's out there,

45:54.017 --> 45:57.020
so I think it's best if
we just call it a night.

45:57.055 --> 46:00.122
- Well,
this has been fun.

46:00.157 --> 46:01.258
Hopefully,
my foot doesn't fall off

46:01.293 --> 46:03.460
in the middle of my sleep.

46:05.095 --> 46:06.580
Hey, Mark.

46:06.615 --> 46:08.007
Great party.

46:08.042 --> 46:09.364
Hey, Tim.

46:09.399 --> 46:11.001
Go fuck yourself.

46:11.935 --> 46:15.205
- Oh, you
want trouble, huh, guy?

46:33.323 --> 46:34.391
Hey.

46:35.058 --> 46:35.991
Are you okay?

46:36.026 --> 46:38.462
- What's wrong, you've
been acting pissed off

46:38.497 --> 46:39.496
since you got back here.

46:39.531 --> 46:41.296
Nothing.

46:41.331 --> 46:42.998
Mark, talk to me.

46:43.033 --> 46:44.868
- You know,
I shouldn't have invited him.

46:44.903 --> 46:45.969
Invited who? Tim?

46:46.004 --> 46:47.169
No. Corey.

46:47.204 --> 46:48.437
What's wrong with Corey?

46:48.472 --> 46:50.305
- You don't get a weird
vibe from that kid?

46:50.340 --> 46:54.378
I mean, I barely know him,
but I thought he was cool.

46:54.413 --> 46:55.277
He seems all right.

46:55.312 --> 46:56.812
Kristen seems to like him.

46:56.847 --> 46:59.316
- Nah, something weird's
happening.

46:59.351 --> 47:00.984
I don't trust him.

47:03.253 --> 47:04.188
What?

47:05.322 --> 47:06.455
I wasn't gonna say anything,

47:06.490 --> 47:09.558
but when you
went to go check outside,

47:09.593 --> 47:13.028
I could've sworn I heard
the front door close.

47:13.063 --> 47:15.132
- What, when did you plan
on telling me this, Jules?

47:15.167 --> 47:16.031
I didn't think about it!

47:16.066 --> 47:19.269
Why are you getting mad at me?

47:19.304 --> 47:21.470
Sorry, it's just...

47:21.505 --> 47:25.142
It's not how
I wanted things to go.

47:25.177 --> 47:26.175
Come here.

47:26.210 --> 47:31.148
It's not your job to make
sure everyone has fun.

47:31.183 --> 47:33.217
We can have our own fun.

47:35.385 --> 47:37.119
You smell like shit.

47:37.154 --> 47:40.157
- Oh, yeah,
I was, um, in the lake.

47:41.325 --> 47:43.260
I know, why exactly?

47:44.361 --> 47:47.097
Just gonna get in the shower.

47:50.567 --> 47:52.302
How about a bath?

47:56.406 --> 47:58.275
What are you doing?

47:59.476 --> 48:01.278
Brushing my teeth?

48:01.313 --> 48:03.045
Where's Corey?

48:03.080 --> 48:05.582
- I think he's
in the living room.

48:05.617 --> 48:07.885
You like him, right?

48:07.920 --> 48:10.153
Yeah, he's cute.

48:10.188 --> 48:11.587
So?

48:11.622 --> 48:13.488
Kristen, I know his type.

48:13.523 --> 48:16.376
He's not gonna
make the first move.

48:16.411 --> 48:19.229
You have to
be the one to initiate.

48:19.264 --> 48:20.529
What am I supposed to do?

48:20.564 --> 48:23.098
- Well, for starters,
stop looking like

48:23.133 --> 48:27.471
you're dressing up for a
middle school slumber party.

48:27.506 --> 48:29.606
These are my pajamas.

48:29.641 --> 48:30.906
No.

48:30.941 --> 48:32.409
These are pajamas.

48:34.611 --> 48:36.079
I don't look like that.

48:36.114 --> 48:37.598
Are you kidding, Kristen?

48:37.633 --> 48:39.082
You have a banging body.

48:39.117 --> 48:40.150
Come here.

48:40.185 --> 48:41.184
Why? Ow!

48:41.219 --> 48:42.119
Ow.

48:42.953 --> 48:44.154
And these...

48:46.523 --> 48:47.991
This has to go.

48:59.436 --> 49:01.403
Are you done?

49:01.438 --> 49:04.041
- What do you
have on under there?

49:04.076 --> 49:05.173
- What?
- I wanna know what

49:05.208 --> 49:06.310
you're wearing under these.
- What? Stop.

49:06.345 --> 49:07.411
What are you doing?

49:07.446 --> 49:08.545
What is it?

49:09.713 --> 49:11.214
Nothing, okay?

49:12.649 --> 49:14.451
Don't have anything.

49:15.452 --> 49:17.254
You happy now?

49:17.289 --> 49:18.188
Nice.

49:20.090 --> 49:23.160
Okay, I think you're ready.

49:23.195 --> 49:24.293
Whatever.

49:24.328 --> 49:25.929
Thank you, I guess.

49:25.964 --> 49:27.531
Hey, one last thing.

49:27.566 --> 49:28.465
What?

49:30.334 --> 49:31.234
What are you doing?

49:31.269 --> 49:32.267
Shh.

49:32.302 --> 49:33.637
Just go with it.

49:44.014 --> 49:46.049
Now you're ready.

50:07.037 --> 50:08.303
See?

50:08.338 --> 50:09.473
This is nice.

50:12.042 --> 50:12.776
Mark.

50:15.746 --> 50:16.646
Mark.

50:16.681 --> 50:17.547
What?

50:19.349 --> 50:21.051
What are you thinking about?

50:21.086 --> 50:21.785
Nothing.

50:24.187 --> 50:25.255
Come here.

50:34.231 --> 50:35.799
What the hell, man?

50:35.834 --> 50:37.367
- Tim!
- Worldstar!

50:38.301 --> 50:39.269
Get out of here, man.

50:39.304 --> 50:40.202
Okay, okay.

50:40.237 --> 50:42.205
I'll go in like 30 minutes.

50:42.240 --> 50:43.372
No, go to bed now.

50:43.407 --> 50:45.358
- All right,
let's all go to bed.

50:45.393 --> 50:47.310
Come on now, get out of the tub.

50:47.345 --> 50:48.410
I don't think so.

50:48.445 --> 50:50.380
- Well, at least
we have the video.

50:50.415 --> 50:51.448
That's it.

51:06.496 --> 51:07.431
Hey.

51:10.067 --> 51:11.266
What you doing?

51:11.301 --> 51:13.303
Um, cutting an apple.

51:14.504 --> 51:15.739
You wanna slice?

51:15.774 --> 51:16.673
Sure.

51:17.808 --> 51:18.742
Thanks.

51:34.257 --> 51:35.392
It's really good.

51:35.427 --> 51:36.691
Yeah.

51:36.726 --> 51:40.130
It looks like
you really enjoyed that.

51:41.698 --> 51:43.834
So, are you having fun?

51:45.235 --> 51:48.705
- Yeah, I mean, it's been
crazier than I thought,

51:48.740 --> 51:50.640
but I'm having fun.

51:50.675 --> 51:51.506
You?

51:51.541 --> 51:52.542
Oh. Yeah.

51:56.379 --> 52:00.315
Well, um,
couch is calling my name.

52:00.350 --> 52:03.854
- Uh, well, I actually wanted
to talk to you about that.

52:03.889 --> 52:06.389
You know,
we don't have to switch.

52:06.424 --> 52:08.256
You can just stay there.

52:08.291 --> 52:10.360
- Well, I mean,
it's a really big bed.

52:10.395 --> 52:12.362
We could just share it.

52:13.563 --> 52:14.863
Yeah?

52:14.898 --> 52:16.600
Like one of us on the covers,

52:16.635 --> 52:18.867
the other one on top.

52:18.902 --> 52:22.839
Or we could put like pillows
between us.

52:22.874 --> 52:23.773
Yeah.

52:25.509 --> 52:26.443
No, um...

52:27.711 --> 52:29.811
Those are really good ideas.

52:29.846 --> 52:33.783
- Look, I don't want you to
get the wrong idea about me.

52:33.818 --> 52:38.221
- I mean, I think
you're cool and, um,

52:39.623 --> 52:43.393
I just don't want to
make you uncomfortable.

52:47.564 --> 52:48.498
I'm not.

53:06.650 --> 53:10.787
- Damn, that's some
serious Notebook shit, man.

53:10.822 --> 53:13.190
Nobody's gonna wanna see that.

53:13.225 --> 53:15.342
Come on, man.

53:15.377 --> 53:17.460
Goodnight, Tim.

53:18.695 --> 53:19.528
All right, man.

53:19.563 --> 53:21.498
Build to that house.

53:21.533 --> 53:23.384
Night, dude.

53:23.419 --> 53:25.200
Night, guys.

53:25.235 --> 53:26.336
Goodnight, everyone!

53:42.319 --> 53:45.322
- Kristen, can I
borrow your blow dryer?

53:45.357 --> 53:46.256
Oh.

53:47.457 --> 53:48.792
Oh!

53:49.726 --> 53:51.328
I'm just gonna...

54:12.315 --> 54:13.250
Mark.

54:15.285 --> 54:16.820
What are you doing?

54:18.855 --> 54:21.258
Beautiful out here, right?

54:21.293 --> 54:21.992
Yeah.

54:23.326 --> 54:25.262
Are you coming inside?

54:28.298 --> 54:29.499
In a second.

54:31.434 --> 54:34.904
- There's some eggs left if
you're hungry.

54:35.905 --> 54:36.806
Okay.

54:47.050 --> 54:48.883
It's cold.

54:48.918 --> 54:50.720
I'm gonna go inside.

54:50.755 --> 54:51.655
Hey.

54:53.056 --> 54:54.057
I love you.

54:57.394 --> 54:58.795
I love you too.

55:07.904 --> 55:09.904
- Yeah, man,
but that's good to hear.

55:09.939 --> 55:12.976
- Things turned out,
you know, unexpectedly.

55:13.011 --> 55:15.412
Yeah, I don't know though.

55:15.447 --> 55:17.814
I think she might be the one.

55:18.682 --> 55:22.552
- So, Corey,
how'd you sleep last night?

55:22.587 --> 55:23.570
Good.

55:23.605 --> 55:24.519
Really?

55:24.554 --> 55:28.358
Sounded like a goddamn Mariah
Carey concert next door.

55:30.960 --> 55:32.527
What's going on?

55:32.562 --> 55:35.532
- Nothing, Mark,
you do own shirts, right?

55:35.567 --> 55:37.667
I'm on vacation, bitch.

55:38.835 --> 55:40.436
So, what are we doing today?

55:40.471 --> 55:42.038
You should go for a run.

55:44.774 --> 55:46.341
I don't know about you guys,

55:46.376 --> 55:48.962
but I'm gonna take my lady
on a little nature hike.

55:48.997 --> 55:51.548
Gonna get in touch with
where the wild things are.

55:51.583 --> 55:53.067
Then what are we gonna do?

55:53.102 --> 55:54.516
You guys wanna go fishing?

55:54.551 --> 55:56.353
I saw they have
some poles over there.

55:56.388 --> 55:56.985
Oh, yeah?

55:57.020 --> 55:58.653
Where'd you see that?

55:58.688 --> 55:59.954
In one of the bedroom closets.

55:59.989 --> 56:05.128
So now you're just going
through everything, huh?

56:11.668 --> 56:13.501
Okay, this seems fun.

56:13.536 --> 56:14.671
Babe, you wanna get going?

56:14.706 --> 56:15.605
Yeah.

56:19.576 --> 56:20.793
Mark.

56:20.828 --> 56:21.976
Mark.

56:22.011 --> 56:23.546
Let's go get something to eat.

56:23.581 --> 56:27.917
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

56:38.395 --> 56:40.497
What was that all about, bro?

56:40.532 --> 56:42.098
I don't know, man.

56:42.966 --> 56:44.100
I don't know.

56:46.002 --> 56:46.936
Babe, wait up.

56:46.971 --> 56:47.836
Well, hurry up.

56:47.871 --> 56:51.141
- Is it me or has Mark
turned into a real psycho?

56:51.176 --> 56:52.609
I think he might be juicing.

56:52.644 --> 56:53.475
Uh, no.

56:53.510 --> 56:54.711
He was drinking coffee.

56:54.746 --> 56:56.077
God, that's cute.

56:56.112 --> 56:58.581
- Wait, do you not even
want me to go with you?

56:58.616 --> 57:01.050
Because you do know
you can go by yourself.

57:01.085 --> 57:02.550
Megan.

57:02.585 --> 57:04.419
You know I want
you to come with me.

57:04.454 --> 57:08.658
You know I've been trying to
get some alone time with you.

57:12.595 --> 57:14.130
Come on, dumb-dumb.

57:18.868 --> 57:21.320
So what happens now?

57:21.355 --> 57:23.281
Now we just wait.

57:23.316 --> 57:24.762
Wait for what?

57:24.797 --> 57:26.209
The fish.

57:27.110 --> 57:27.977
Oh.

57:32.782 --> 57:34.449
For how long?

57:34.484 --> 57:36.786
As long as it takes.

57:41.558 --> 57:42.891
Well, I'm bored.

57:42.926 --> 57:44.994
You wanna hold my pole?

57:45.628 --> 57:49.499
- No, Johnny, I don't
wanna hold your pole.

57:49.534 --> 57:50.834
Babe.

57:50.869 --> 57:52.135
Uh oh.

57:53.002 --> 57:54.969
Nah, man, she's cool.

57:55.004 --> 57:56.606
You should cast over there.

57:56.641 --> 57:57.391
Over there?

57:57.426 --> 57:58.141
All right.

58:02.645 --> 58:04.045
You get something?

58:04.080 --> 58:06.216
I'm stuck on something.

58:06.251 --> 58:07.550
Let me see.

58:11.788 --> 58:13.156
Probably just stuck on some
weeds.

58:14.491 --> 58:15.890
There we go.

58:15.925 --> 58:17.994
Something's on the line.

58:18.029 --> 58:19.727
What is that?

58:19.762 --> 58:21.731
Is that a shirt?

58:22.632 --> 58:23.731
Oh, shit.

58:23.766 --> 58:26.803
- Looks like
somebody went skinny-dipping.

58:26.838 --> 58:29.873
- Dude, that's a
hospital gown.

58:29.908 --> 58:31.673
That's really weird.

58:31.708 --> 58:33.510
- Dude, can I tell you
something?

58:33.545 --> 58:34.909
Yeah, what's up?

58:34.944 --> 58:36.846
- All right, so last night
when I was looking for Mark...

58:36.881 --> 58:39.048
- Jesus Christ!
- What the fuck man!

58:39.083 --> 58:40.884
Hey, y'all doing some fishing?

58:40.919 --> 58:41.716
Yeah.

58:41.751 --> 58:42.784
Catch anything good?

58:42.819 --> 58:44.219
Nah, man, this lake sucks.

58:44.254 --> 58:46.856
All we got is some shitty
hospital gown.

58:46.891 --> 58:48.057
Let me see that.

59:00.303 --> 59:03.039
Y'all gonna
keep doing some fishing?

59:03.074 --> 59:04.572
Nah, man.

59:04.607 --> 59:05.874
We're good.
- Yeah.

59:05.909 --> 59:07.143
Let's go back to the house.

59:27.697 --> 59:29.832
- Looks like somebody
was out here camping.

59:29.867 --> 59:32.352
You think they're still here?

59:32.387 --> 59:34.802
No, I don't see any tents.

59:34.837 --> 59:37.574
- Babe, why
don't we ever go camping?

59:37.609 --> 59:40.177
Meg, you know I only like you

59:40.212 --> 59:42.710
in the kitchen and the bedroom.

59:42.745 --> 59:45.531
- You know, I'm getting
really tired of your shit.

59:45.566 --> 59:48.318
but behind all your
jokes, there's some truth.

59:48.353 --> 59:49.620
If you think I'm only good for
sex,

59:49.655 --> 59:50.887
then maybe we
shouldn't be together.

59:50.922 --> 59:51.986
Okay, okay.

59:52.021 --> 59:53.655
I was just having fun.

59:53.690 --> 59:54.824
You know how I feel about you.

59:54.859 --> 59:55.657
Yeah?

59:55.692 --> 59:56.693
How's that?

59:58.094 --> 59:59.228
I love you?

01:00:00.797 --> 01:00:01.798
You what?

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:03.967
I love you?

01:00:06.235 --> 01:00:08.154
I can't wait till
we move in together,

01:00:08.189 --> 01:00:10.073
and start a life, and have
babies, and...

01:00:10.108 --> 01:00:11.072
Ah, yeah, yeah.

01:00:11.107 --> 01:00:13.009
Let's just enjoy the moment.

01:00:13.044 --> 01:00:14.194
Oh!

01:00:14.229 --> 01:00:15.310
Okay.

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:16.813
Ooh, hey now!

01:00:25.054 --> 01:00:26.656
Baby, I love you.

01:00:26.691 --> 01:00:27.755
Uh-huh.

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:30.093
I said I love you.

01:00:30.128 --> 01:00:31.144
Tim.

01:00:31.179 --> 01:00:32.126
What?

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:35.365
Did you not hear what I said?

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:36.966
I love you too.

01:00:39.002 --> 01:00:40.737
Hold on, hold on.

01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:43.673
Okay, go.

01:00:44.307 --> 01:00:45.241
Worldstar!

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.348
Oh, shit!

01:01:02.859 --> 01:01:04.292
Going somewhere?

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:05.611
Pack your things, Kim.

01:01:05.646 --> 01:01:06.788
Where are we going?

01:01:06.823 --> 01:01:07.895
We're going home.

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:09.431
There's some crazy shit going on

01:01:09.466 --> 01:01:10.933
and we need to get outta here.

01:01:10.968 --> 01:01:12.602
You're scared, Johnny?

01:01:12.637 --> 01:01:14.202
Kim, it's not a joke.

01:01:14.237 --> 01:01:15.555
I don't know what this place is

01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:16.838
or why Mark brought us out here.

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:18.740
All that I know is I'm the only
black dude

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:21.110
and I'm not sticking around
to see what happens next.

01:01:21.145 --> 01:01:22.211
Well, I'm having fun.

01:01:22.246 --> 01:01:23.146
Fine.

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:38.061
- So you're just
gonna walk home?

01:01:38.096 --> 01:01:39.093
Go back inside.

01:01:39.128 --> 01:01:40.212
Where are you going?

01:01:40.247 --> 01:01:41.262
Go find Tim and Megan.

01:01:41.297 --> 01:01:43.433
Take Tim's
car and get outta here.

01:01:43.468 --> 01:01:44.265
What? No.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.733
Johnny, are you serious?

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:51.074
That guy, my foot, stuff
that happened last night,

01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:52.373
what more do you need?

01:01:52.408 --> 01:01:56.045
Look,
if you wanna stay, that's fine.

01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:59.248
Go back to the cabin.

01:02:01.818 --> 01:02:02.450
Wait, baby.

01:02:02.485 --> 01:02:03.419
I'm sorry, okay?

01:02:03.454 --> 01:02:04.353
Come on.

01:02:06.255 --> 01:02:07.256
Be careful.

01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:14.864
You sure you wanna do that?

01:02:14.899 --> 01:02:15.798
I am.

01:02:21.003 --> 01:02:22.103
I win.

01:02:22.138 --> 01:02:25.206
How did I cheat?

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:26.909
You guys seen Johnny or Kim?

01:02:26.944 --> 01:02:28.142
Uh, no, why?

01:02:28.177 --> 01:02:30.513
They're not in their room?

01:02:30.548 --> 01:02:31.746
No.

01:02:31.781 --> 01:02:35.752
- Maybe they went for a
hike like Tim and Megan did.

01:02:35.787 --> 01:02:37.087
What's going on here?

01:02:37.122 --> 01:02:38.272
Just playing a game.

01:02:38.307 --> 01:02:39.387
Where'd you get it?

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:42.024
- What?
- Where'd you find it?

01:02:42.992 --> 01:02:43.926
I...

01:02:44.961 --> 01:02:47.330
- I found it
in one of the rooms.

01:02:47.365 --> 01:02:48.396
Really?

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:50.166
Here, taste this.

01:02:51.968 --> 01:02:54.270
Let's go to the bedroom.

01:02:54.305 --> 01:02:55.204
Come on.

01:03:03.246 --> 01:03:05.379
You wanna play again?

01:03:05.414 --> 01:03:06.783
Can I tell you something?

01:03:06.818 --> 01:03:07.984
What's that?

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:12.321
- So last night when
everything was happening...

01:03:17.994 --> 01:03:18.928
Megan!

01:03:19.796 --> 01:03:20.530
Tim!

01:03:25.568 --> 01:03:27.036
Megan!

01:03:27.071 --> 01:03:28.504
Tim!

01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:31.272
Johnny, I don't know.

01:03:31.307 --> 01:03:33.009
- They couldn't
have gone too far.

01:03:33.044 --> 01:03:34.110
Let's keep going.

01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:43.551
Wait.

01:03:43.586 --> 01:03:44.887
Did you hear that?

01:03:44.922 --> 01:03:46.455
Hear what?

01:03:48.224 --> 01:03:49.425
What was that?

01:03:51.227 --> 01:03:52.161
Megan!

01:03:53.296 --> 01:03:54.195
Megan!

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:55.898
Kim, wait!

01:04:17.153 --> 01:04:18.087
Oh no!

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:21.690
We have to go!

01:04:21.725 --> 01:04:22.458
What's going on?

01:04:22.493 --> 01:04:23.291
Run!

01:04:23.326 --> 01:04:25.127
Oh, shit!

01:04:28.965 --> 01:04:29.997
Johnny!

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:31.367
Johnny, come on!

01:04:35.104 --> 01:04:36.038
I'm sorry.

01:04:37.273 --> 01:04:38.374
What?

01:05:22.451 --> 01:05:24.253
It's just over here.

01:05:24.288 --> 01:05:25.321
Wait.

01:05:26.422 --> 01:05:27.356
What?

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.395
Okay.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.802
Where is it?

01:05:39.837 --> 01:05:41.604
Where's what?

01:05:41.639 --> 01:05:42.904
Mark.

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:45.007
- What are you guys doing in
here?

01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:46.374
What's with the bat?

01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:47.541
Oh, I just wanted to see

01:05:47.576 --> 01:05:51.047
if anyone was up
for a little baseball.

01:05:51.082 --> 01:05:52.446
Looking for something?

01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:55.367
- Yeah, where's
the crate that was here?

01:05:55.402 --> 01:05:58.219
- The crate
with the stuffed animal.

01:05:58.254 --> 01:06:00.990
- I don't know what you're
talking about.

01:06:01.025 --> 01:06:03.025
Are you serious, dude?

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:04.058
Corey?

01:06:04.093 --> 01:06:05.626
No, I swear it was here.

01:06:05.661 --> 01:06:08.998
- Sounds like a sad
excuse to get you alone.

01:06:09.033 --> 01:06:11.233
Seems pretty
pathetic if you ask me.

01:06:11.268 --> 01:06:13.369
No, that, that's not...

01:06:14.437 --> 01:06:15.504
Whatever.

01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:19.008
- Where do you think
you're going?

01:06:19.043 --> 01:06:20.107
What is this?

01:06:20.142 --> 01:06:21.827
Corey, Corey, Corey.

01:06:21.862 --> 01:06:23.512
You just couldn't!

01:06:24.447 --> 01:06:25.481
Leave it!

01:06:25.516 --> 01:06:26.480
Alone!

01:06:26.515 --> 01:06:29.118
What is the matter with you?

01:06:29.153 --> 01:06:30.153
Don't worry.

01:06:30.188 --> 01:06:31.153
You're next.

01:06:49.705 --> 01:06:52.039
Please don't kill me.

01:06:52.074 --> 01:06:54.477
Please, I just wanna go home!

01:07:05.287 --> 01:07:06.220
I won't tell anybody.

01:07:06.255 --> 01:07:08.791
Just please, I don't wanna die!

01:07:31.647 --> 01:07:34.583
- This is not
how I wanted things to go.

01:07:34.618 --> 01:07:36.953
Why are you doing this?

01:07:36.988 --> 01:07:39.288
Julia, sweetheart.

01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:44.560
Why don't you try something
that you've never done before?

01:07:44.595 --> 01:07:46.162
And shut the fuck up!

01:07:46.197 --> 01:07:47.695
Mark, this isn't funny.

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:50.433
We didn't do anything wrong.

01:07:50.468 --> 01:07:51.732
You.

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:54.201
I should've never invited you.

01:07:54.236 --> 01:07:55.536
You just had to go
and fuck things up

01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:57.856
by getting into things you
shouldn't have.

01:07:57.891 --> 01:08:00.142
- You know exactly what I'm
talking about!

01:08:00.177 --> 01:08:02.143
I'm talking about this!

01:08:02.178 --> 01:08:04.613
All the patients
that got killed out here!

01:08:04.648 --> 01:08:06.549
- I don't even
know what those are.

01:08:06.584 --> 01:08:08.385
You don't know what they are.

01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:10.186
Well, did you see this one?

01:08:10.221 --> 01:08:11.320
No.

01:08:12.521 --> 01:08:14.190
This is my cousin.

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:18.461
He used to live
out here with my uncle.

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:24.867
When my uncle died,
they couldn't find him.

01:08:26.868 --> 01:08:31.273
But now, I'm starting to think
maybe he's still out here.

01:08:33.475 --> 01:08:37.145
And I can't be
babysitting your nosy asses

01:08:38.214 --> 01:08:40.149
while I try to find him!

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:43.317
Someone's outside.

01:08:43.352 --> 01:08:44.720
- It's probably just
Tim and Johnny wanting

01:08:44.755 --> 01:08:46.471
to join the party.

01:08:46.506 --> 01:08:48.154
I'll go grab them.

01:08:48.189 --> 01:08:51.260
Don't you fucking move!

01:08:57.198 --> 01:08:58.600
Hey, guys.

01:09:20.523 --> 01:09:21.721
Wait!

01:09:21.756 --> 01:09:23.492
His car keys!

01:09:33.636 --> 01:09:35.504
Come on, keys, keys, keys.

01:09:57.526 --> 01:09:58.460
Henry?

01:09:59.662 --> 01:10:01.197
Henry, it's you.

01:10:01.797 --> 01:10:02.898
It's me, your cousin Mark.

01:10:02.933 --> 01:10:04.967
Remember me?

01:10:05.734 --> 01:10:07.801
It's okay.

01:10:07.836 --> 01:10:09.837
Here, take this.

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:11.639
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:10:11.674 --> 01:10:14.743
We're gonna take you
some place safe, okay?

01:10:14.778 --> 01:10:16.377
Here.

01:10:16.412 --> 01:10:17.596
It's okay.

01:10:17.631 --> 01:10:18.781
I promise.

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:23.784
Everything is gonna be fine.

01:10:23.819 --> 01:10:26.255
We're gonna
take you some place safe.

01:10:26.290 --> 01:10:27.655
It's okay.

01:10:27.690 --> 01:10:29.325
- No!
- What are you doing?

01:10:30.793 --> 01:10:33.729
Don't even
think about, just stop!

01:10:42.404 --> 01:10:45.974
Why did you make me do that?

01:10:46.009 --> 01:10:49.345
You always ruined everything!

01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:52.681
What's the matter with you?

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:57.519
- I guess crazy
just runs in the family.

01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:18.841
Never liked that kid.

01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:21.644
You ready?

01:11:22.678 --> 01:11:25.014
Everything is gonna be fine.

01:11:26.282 --> 01:11:27.349
Here.

01:11:33.689 --> 01:11:34.623
Okay?

01:11:35.457 --> 01:11:36.892
Let's do this.

01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:39.561
Henry.

01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:31.814
Tim!

01:12:31.849 --> 01:12:33.082
Tim!

01:12:55.437 --> 01:12:59.041
Where the fuck are the keys?

01:13:01.777 --> 01:13:02.711
No, no!

01:14:03.839 --> 01:14:05.172
Stay back!

01:14:05.207 --> 01:14:06.675
Just stay back!

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:10.913
I'm just gonna
get in the car and go.

01:14:12.481 --> 01:14:14.550
No don't do that!

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:01.530
You all right?

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:05.634
No.

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:09.538
He killed them.

01:15:09.573 --> 01:15:11.240
He killed them all.

01:15:13.075 --> 01:15:16.812
Well, it's over now.

01:15:22.751 --> 01:15:25.686
All right.

01:15:25.721 --> 01:15:27.756
You're safe.
Calm down.

01:15:27.791 --> 01:15:29.258
All right?

01:15:30.592 --> 01:15:32.759
Phone back at my house.

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:36.231
Go there, we'll call
the police, all right?

01:15:36.266 --> 01:15:37.900
Thank you.

01:15:37.935 --> 01:15:39.535
Come on.

01:15:56.985 --> 01:16:01.323
So your friends, you,
uh, you sure they're...

01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:02.858
Yeah.

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.294
That's a damn shame.

01:16:06.329 --> 01:16:08.113
That's a shame, darling.

01:16:08.148 --> 01:16:09.898
Do you know why he did it?

01:16:10.265 --> 01:16:11.900
No.

01:16:13.769 --> 01:16:18.040
- Well, I told
him I'd seen you first.

01:16:19.875 --> 01:16:21.777
What?

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:28.717
- But I guess they
don't call it Crazy Lake

01:16:28.752 --> 01:16:30.252
for nothing, right?

01:16:38.293 --> 01:16:40.227
Where's your house?

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:46.101
- Darling, if you weren't scared
before, you should be now.

01:16:48.804 --> 01:16:50.872
Please, no.
