01:02.715 --> 01:04.114
What have you got
for me, Fitz?

01:04.183 --> 01:05.980
l knew you'd be the guy
to call on this, Kev.

01:06.052 --> 01:08.350
This is big, and l figured
you'd have the connections to...

01:08.421 --> 01:10.514
Show me.

01:27.273 --> 01:29.764
l'm just the middle man.

01:38.718 --> 01:40.117
Are you the buyer?

01:40.186 --> 01:42.711
lt depends.
What are you selling?

01:42.789 --> 01:44.882
Alien technology...

01:44.957 --> 01:48.017
the good stuff.

01:48.094 --> 01:50.426
Watch the paint.

02:06.078 --> 02:07.306
What is it?

02:07.380 --> 02:09.176
You don't know?

02:09.247 --> 02:11.273
You don't know,
do you?

02:11.350 --> 02:14.080
ls it a weapon?
Does it fire?

02:14.153 --> 02:16.053
Can it blow stuff up?

02:16.122 --> 02:17.714
See, this is
important information

02:17.790 --> 02:18.916
for a prospective buyer.

02:18.991 --> 02:20.856
lt's alien technology, man.

02:20.927 --> 02:22.758
lt's gotta be
worth some money.

02:22.829 --> 02:24.023
Are you interested
or not?

02:24.096 --> 02:26.530
Just chill.

02:26.599 --> 02:28.863
Let me talk
to my partners.

02:28.935 --> 02:29.833
Partners?

02:29.902 --> 02:31.494
You didn't say anything
about partners.

02:31.571 --> 02:32.936
Neither did you.

02:38.010 --> 02:40.570
You're working
with him?

02:40.646 --> 02:42.079
Actually,
l'm working with her.

02:42.148 --> 02:43.410
Kevin doesn't really work,

02:43.483 --> 02:45.212
he just stands around
flexing his muscles.

02:45.284 --> 02:46.979
Yeah, how about l flex 'em
in your face?

02:47.053 --> 02:48.315
Who are these jokers,
man?

02:48.387 --> 02:49.752
l can't tell you.
l'm just the middle man.

02:49.822 --> 02:51.312
We're just some
regular old folks

02:51.390 --> 02:54.450
who are beginning to think this is
a big, fat waste of our time.

02:54.527 --> 02:56.392
What do we got?

02:56.462 --> 02:58.157
l've never seen anything
like 'em, Ben.

02:58.231 --> 02:59.994
They're complex.

03:00.066 --> 03:02.694
Must be grade 9 tech
at least.

03:05.771 --> 03:06.669
Whatever they are,

03:06.739 --> 03:08.138
they're screwing up
the Omnitrix.

03:08.207 --> 03:09.572
What's with you guys?

03:09.642 --> 03:11.837
l've never met buyers
like you before.

03:11.911 --> 03:14.744
You never met anyone
like them before

03:14.814 --> 03:17.874
because they're not just
black market lowlifes like you.

03:17.950 --> 03:19.815
They're Plumbers.

03:19.886 --> 03:22.252
You mean they're gonna pay for
this stuff by fixing my toilet?

03:22.321 --> 03:25.484
The Plumbers are a secret
interplanetary security force,

03:25.558 --> 03:27.822
saving the world
so we don't have to.

03:27.894 --> 03:29.885
Oh, right, of course.

03:29.962 --> 03:31.623
We're cops from outer space.

03:31.697 --> 03:35.292
Or maybe,
we're firemen from Atlantis.

03:35.368 --> 03:38.496
How did you learn about
these Plumbers you think we are?

03:41.641 --> 03:43.609
Everything l know
about the Plumbers,

03:43.676 --> 03:45.507
l learned
the same way you did...

03:45.578 --> 03:47.307
Ben.

03:47.380 --> 03:48.312
Elena?

03:48.381 --> 03:50.975
No. Way.

03:51.050 --> 03:52.608
Oh, you still
remember me.

03:52.685 --> 03:53.515
l'm honored.

03:53.586 --> 03:54.484
Hello?

03:54.554 --> 03:56.818
Can anyone toss me a clue
as to what's going on here?

03:56.889 --> 03:59.619
Kevin, this is Elena Validus.

03:59.692 --> 04:01.887
She's a Plumbers' Kid,
like us.

04:01.961 --> 04:03.258
Not like you, Gwen.

04:03.329 --> 04:04.853
None of my ancestors
were aliens.

04:04.931 --> 04:07.297
l don't have any cool
powers to rely on.

04:07.366 --> 04:08.958
We hung out for a while
back in the day.

04:09.035 --> 04:10.400
Then Elena's dad quit.

04:10.469 --> 04:12.096
And you moved away

04:12.171 --> 04:13.263
and we haven't heard
from you since.

04:13.339 --> 04:14.897
ls that what they told you?

04:14.974 --> 04:16.373
That my dad quit?

04:16.442 --> 04:18.204
Considering that
you have more power

04:18.277 --> 04:19.437
than all the Plumbers combined,

04:19.512 --> 04:20.375
you sure don't
know much.

04:20.446 --> 04:22.209
Then why don't you tell me?

04:22.281 --> 04:24.181
What's going on?
What are you doing here
with these chips?

04:24.250 --> 04:25.478
l'm here to find you.

04:25.551 --> 04:27.576
The Plumbers don't
exactly advertise.

04:27.653 --> 04:29.484
l need your help, Ben.

04:29.555 --> 04:31.216
lt's my father.
He's been abducted.

04:31.290 --> 04:33.053
Call the cops.

04:33.125 --> 04:34.319
They can't help.

04:34.393 --> 04:36.623
His disappearance is connected
with these alien chips.

04:36.696 --> 04:38.061
We'll help you find him,
Elena.

04:38.130 --> 04:39.461
You're a Plumbers' Kid,
and a friend.

04:39.532 --> 04:40.590
Am l, Ben?

04:40.666 --> 04:41.724
Really?

04:41.801 --> 04:43.666
Because life's been pretty hard
for the last three years,

04:43.736 --> 04:46.034
and l don't recall you
ever looking us up.

04:49.609 --> 04:50.940
What is that?

04:51.010 --> 04:52.341
Elena?

04:52.411 --> 04:54.402
- l don't know.
- lt's a double-cross.

04:54.480 --> 04:55.913
A trap, Ben.

04:55.982 --> 04:58.177
No!  swear it!
l just wanted your help!

04:58.250 --> 04:59.774
Don't wanna impose
on your little dysfunctions,

04:59.852 --> 05:02.218
so...

05:14.333 --> 05:16.767
Bring them back to us.

05:20.139 --> 05:22.232
Kevin, l think you were right

05:22.308 --> 05:24.435
about these not being
ordinary computer chips.

05:24.510 --> 05:27.035
Stay down!

05:40.960 --> 05:42.120
Gwen!

05:48.768 --> 05:49.700
Ben!

05:49.769 --> 05:51.964
l don't mean
to backseat drive,

05:52.038 --> 05:53.903
but it might be
a good time for the Omnitrix.

05:53.973 --> 05:55.099
Not!

05:55.174 --> 05:57.039
l think it's having
a meltdown or something.

05:57.109 --> 06:00.601
Don't sweat it, dude.
lf you can't handle it...

06:00.680 --> 06:03.148
l know someone
who can.

06:04.950 --> 06:07.885
What's going on?

06:07.953 --> 06:09.614
They're all, like,
freaks or something!

06:09.689 --> 06:12.522
Let's get outta here,
man!

06:38.918 --> 06:40.476
They're not just chips.

06:40.553 --> 06:43.818
lt's some kind of alien
nano-technology.

06:43.889 --> 06:45.584
The attack is too organized.

06:45.658 --> 06:47.717
There must be
intelligence behind it.

06:54.567 --> 06:55.864
l don't know
if he's intelligent,

06:55.935 --> 06:58.995
but l think we found
the puppeteer.

07:00.773 --> 07:01.831
That's not good.

07:01.907 --> 07:04.137
Ready or not!

07:07.947 --> 07:10.438
Come on, Spider Monkey.

07:17.690 --> 07:19.988
Big Chill?

07:20.059 --> 07:22.527
That'll work.

07:28.768 --> 07:31.066
Hold on, Gwen!

07:50.589 --> 07:52.819
Are you all right?

07:52.892 --> 07:55.190
Yeah.
Thanks.

07:55.261 --> 07:56.922
Who is that guy, Elena?

07:56.996 --> 07:58.361
l don't know.

07:58.430 --> 08:00.955
Then let's find out.

08:11.744 --> 08:13.109
No!

08:14.613 --> 08:16.979
Gwen!

08:19.652 --> 08:21.244
Gwen, are you okay?

08:21.320 --> 08:22.753
Yeah, l'm fine.

08:22.822 --> 08:24.289
Who is that guy?

08:24.356 --> 08:28.053
l think you mean,
who was he?

08:28.127 --> 08:30.118
Elena?

08:30.196 --> 08:31.322
lf you're looking
for your girlfriend,

08:31.397 --> 08:33.660
l think your personal
charm was too much for her.

08:33.732 --> 08:35.495
Kevin was right..
she set us up.

08:35.568 --> 08:38.264
Did she?

08:38.337 --> 08:40.965
l'm not so sure.

08:59.158 --> 09:02.059
This whole thing is wrong
from top to bottom.

09:02.127 --> 09:05.119
Yeah, starting with that crazy
biker babe girlfriend of yours.

09:05.197 --> 09:06.289
Elena's not my girlfriend,
Kevin.

09:06.365 --> 09:07.559
We were, like, 13.

09:07.633 --> 09:09.066
Her story doesn't add up, Ben.

09:09.134 --> 09:10.692
Why sell alien tech
on the black market

09:10.769 --> 09:12.760
just to find the Plumbers
when her father used to be one?

09:12.838 --> 09:14.328
She said that something
happened to her dad

09:14.406 --> 09:16.567
back when they lived here,
and we weren't told
the truth about it.

09:16.642 --> 09:18.075
lf that's the case,

09:18.143 --> 09:21.271
Grandpa Max has some serious
explaining to do.

09:22.448 --> 09:24.609
l'm sorry,

09:24.683 --> 09:26.480
that old girl's
gonna need new pistons.

09:26.552 --> 09:27.576
There's no getting around it.

09:27.653 --> 09:30.053
- Hey, Ed.
- Hey, guys.

09:30.122 --> 09:32.886
Gotta grab something
out of the back.

09:32.958 --> 09:34.892
Hey, Ben, you going
to the game tomorrow?

09:34.960 --> 09:36.552
Uh...

09:36.629 --> 09:37.561
l hope so, Molly.

09:37.630 --> 09:39.860
Just got hit
with some serious, uh,

09:39.932 --> 09:42.867
homework.

09:44.270 --> 09:45.328
You know Benji,

09:45.404 --> 09:48.305
all work
and no play.

09:50.376 --> 09:51.400
Seriously,

09:51.477 --> 09:52.705
look, that's the best
l can do for you.

09:52.778 --> 09:55.246
l don't make the price,
l just fix the cars.

09:58.384 --> 10:01.444
l don't recognize it,
and l really don't like it.

10:01.520 --> 10:02.714
Me neither.

10:02.788 --> 10:03.914
Sooner we get that
under the scanner,

10:03.989 --> 10:05.183
the sooner we can
hunt down that creep

10:05.257 --> 10:06.747
and his army of flying chips.

10:06.825 --> 10:09.316
You mean the chips your gal pal
illegally had in her possession?

10:09.395 --> 10:12.694
All right, Kev.
l think he gets it.

10:18.370 --> 10:20.895
l don't get what
you see in him.

10:28.948 --> 10:30.973
System's up.

10:31.050 --> 10:32.574
Good afternoon, Ben.

10:32.651 --> 10:34.983
Now activating all partitions.

10:35.054 --> 10:37.716
Ben, did you ask Grandpa Max
if we could use the Comm Center?

10:37.790 --> 10:39.155
You wanna start
solving this thing,

10:39.224 --> 10:41.715
or you wanna go looking
for a permission slip?

10:57.076 --> 11:01.035
Engaging comprehensive interior
and exterior scan.

11:01.113 --> 11:05.049
Biological and inorganic matter
detected.

11:05.117 --> 11:08.018
Molecular density is inert.

11:08.087 --> 11:12.023
Austenitic, ferritic, and
martensitic phase microstructure.

11:12.091 --> 11:15.151
Both organic and inorganic
materials.

11:15.227 --> 11:17.718
Gwen, you are a credit
to the science club.

11:17.796 --> 11:19.764
l've never seen
anything like this.

11:19.832 --> 11:21.390
l mean, it's tech,

11:21.467 --> 11:23.935
but it's also a carbon-silken
based life form.

11:24.003 --> 11:26.198
So they're alive.

11:26.271 --> 11:28.262
Man, l'm liking these
less and less.

11:28.340 --> 11:30.308
Well, they were alive,
kind of.

11:30.376 --> 11:32.936
Now they're in alien chip
heaven.

11:33.012 --> 11:36.277
Let me see if l can trace
where they came from.

11:41.720 --> 11:43.449
They're completely inert.

11:43.522 --> 11:45.319
l can't pick up
any energy signature.

11:45.391 --> 11:47.052
What now?

11:47.126 --> 11:49.287
Well, maybe l can jumpstart
an energy pulse,

11:49.361 --> 11:52.262
but it will take forever,
and it'll be a total pain in the...

11:52.331 --> 11:54.595
All right, l'll get
right on it.

11:54.666 --> 11:56.258
Or, we could just find Elena,

11:56.335 --> 11:57.768
and ask her
where they came from.

11:57.836 --> 11:59.770
What makes you think that
she would tell you the truth?

11:59.838 --> 12:01.328
She could have set us up.

12:01.407 --> 12:02.567
She's one of us.

12:02.641 --> 12:03.801
She was one of us.

12:03.876 --> 12:05.537
You have no idea
who she is now.

12:05.611 --> 12:07.169
You can't trust her.

12:07.246 --> 12:08.645
Evidently l can't
trust anyone.

12:08.714 --> 12:09.942
l can't even trust Max.

12:10.015 --> 12:11.448
Trust me to do what?

12:11.517 --> 12:13.883
Hey, Grandpa.

12:13.952 --> 12:16.352
We can't trust you to make soup
without putting

12:16.422 --> 12:18.515
baked hummus,
or lizard gizzards in it.

12:18.590 --> 12:20.683
Hmm.

12:20.759 --> 12:23.125
That sounds like
a pretty good combo.

12:23.195 --> 12:25.493
What are you guys doing
down here in the hole

12:25.564 --> 12:27.156
on off hours?

12:27.232 --> 12:29.996
Uh, we had a little
situation.

12:30.069 --> 12:31.263
Commencing scan.

12:31.336 --> 12:33.804
Hey, what's that?

12:33.872 --> 12:35.840
Looks familiar.

12:35.908 --> 12:38.706
l've seen that
somewhere before.

12:38.777 --> 12:41.007
You have?
Where?

12:41.080 --> 12:43.207
Max, there's something
you need to explain...

12:43.282 --> 12:45.842
Unidentified intrusion
at entryway three.

12:45.918 --> 12:48.045
Sounds like we've got
an uninvited guest.

12:48.120 --> 12:50.714
Kev, punch up a tracker
on the complex.

12:50.789 --> 12:52.256
No need.

12:52.324 --> 12:54.258
l've got 'em.

12:54.326 --> 12:55.588
They're in Max's office!

12:55.661 --> 12:58.994
They better not touch
my model train set!

12:59.064 --> 13:01.396
l just painted the caboose!

13:13.579 --> 13:17.174
Over here, guys.

13:17.249 --> 13:20.047
Whoever you are, you picked
the wrong place to break into.

13:20.119 --> 13:24.681
You're gonna be one
fried, roasted and baked...

13:24.756 --> 13:26.018
babe?

13:26.091 --> 13:28.286
lt's okay, Max.

13:28.360 --> 13:29.793
You probably don't recognize
her, she's...

13:29.862 --> 13:32.922
lt's not okay.
lt's a Validus.

13:32.998 --> 13:34.625
How'd you get in here?

13:37.603 --> 13:39.537
lt's time to get Big Ed
some glasses.

13:39.605 --> 13:41.505
Been a long time,
Mr. Tennyson.

13:41.573 --> 13:44.303
You shouldn't have come here,
Elena.

13:44.376 --> 13:46.037
Max, Elena was the one
who set up the sale

13:46.111 --> 13:47.738
of those weird chips.

13:47.813 --> 13:48.677
Of course.

13:48.747 --> 13:51.045
l knew l'd seen those before.

13:51.116 --> 13:52.344
lt's time for you
to go!

13:52.417 --> 13:54.385
Mr. Tennyson,
l had to do that.

13:54.453 --> 13:55.545
l need help,
and it was the only way

13:55.621 --> 13:56.519
l could think of to get it.

13:56.588 --> 13:57.646
You know the rules!

13:57.723 --> 13:58.781
lt's my father!

13:58.857 --> 14:01.291
He's been kidnapped by whoever,
or whatever made those chips.

14:01.360 --> 14:04.193
l knew that only
The Plumbers could help.

14:04.263 --> 14:05.457
Get her outta here!

14:05.531 --> 14:06.896
You're not serious.
She needs help.

14:06.965 --> 14:08.227
That's an order!

14:08.300 --> 14:09.494
You heard the man.

14:09.568 --> 14:11.365
l don't know what's going on,
but he means it.

14:11.436 --> 14:13.336
Come on, Elena.

14:13.405 --> 14:15.600
Then l'll tell you
what's going on, Gwen.

14:15.674 --> 14:17.608
Your sweet old grandpa
turned his back on us

14:17.676 --> 14:19.303
three years ago...

14:19.378 --> 14:21.369
Threw us out on the street
when we needed his help,

14:21.446 --> 14:23.243
lied to you
to cover his tracks.

14:23.315 --> 14:24.942
Now my father
is in serious trouble,

14:25.017 --> 14:26.416
and Max still won't
help us.

14:26.485 --> 14:28.077
ls that true?

14:28.153 --> 14:29.245
Can't we just
talk to her?

14:29.321 --> 14:30.879
No, Ben.

14:30.956 --> 14:34.448
Anything she said
would be a lie.

14:34.526 --> 14:36.460
Kevin.

14:36.528 --> 14:38.496
Thanks for the help.

14:38.564 --> 14:40.327
You guys are real heroes.

14:40.399 --> 14:42.424
And, Ben,

14:42.501 --> 14:44.833
thanks for being a real friend.

14:50.676 --> 14:52.166
What's wrong with you?

14:52.244 --> 14:54.269
There's nothing
wrong with me,

14:54.346 --> 14:56.837
but there's a lot wrong
with her.

14:56.915 --> 14:59.213
She's Victor Validus' daughter.

14:59.284 --> 15:01.650
Okay, l'm sufficiently stumped.

15:01.720 --> 15:04.689
What's going on here?

15:04.756 --> 15:07.350
Dr. Victor Emilio Validus.

15:07.426 --> 15:08.893
Plumber l.D...

15:08.961 --> 15:11.987
Victor Validus was
the best Plumber l ever trained.

15:12.064 --> 15:15.329
We stopped more than
our share of invasions.

15:15.400 --> 15:19.200
l trusted Vic
with my life.

15:19.271 --> 15:22.536
l wanted to trust the running
of this place to him.

15:22.608 --> 15:25.975
Until he betrayed me.

15:26.044 --> 15:27.705
What?

15:27.779 --> 15:31.180
He was caught stealing alien
technology from our vaults.

15:31.250 --> 15:34.879
Tech that he swore
he'd protect the earth from.

15:34.953 --> 15:38.116
He was given
a dishonorable discharge.

15:38.190 --> 15:40.181
A traitor.

15:40.259 --> 15:41.954
Traitor's daughter's left
the building.

15:42.027 --> 15:43.585
What did he steal?

15:43.662 --> 15:46.790
Same stuff Elena
was dealing.

15:46.865 --> 15:50.266
You still think
she's the girl you know?

15:50.335 --> 15:51.802
She told us the truth
about one thing,

15:51.870 --> 15:53.235
you lied to us.

15:53.305 --> 15:54.932
l did that for your own good.

15:55.007 --> 15:56.804
You were too young
to understand.

15:56.875 --> 15:57.899
l still don't understand.

15:57.976 --> 15:59.876
You can't judge her
by what her father did.

15:59.945 --> 16:01.742
Ben, stay away from her.

16:01.813 --> 16:04.145
The Validus family
is blacklisted.

16:04.216 --> 16:07.310
There can be no interaction
between them and the Plumbers.

16:07.386 --> 16:08.944
That's the way
you see it.

16:09.021 --> 16:10.682
The way l see it,
a friend is in trouble.

16:10.756 --> 16:12.485
And she's the best link
we have to those chips

16:12.557 --> 16:13.922
and the freak
who's controlling them.

16:13.992 --> 16:15.584
A whole lot more people
could end up in trouble

16:15.661 --> 16:16.923
besides Elena
and her father.

16:16.995 --> 16:19.486
That's why we are going
to analyze those chips

16:19.564 --> 16:22.294
and take care of this crisis
by the book!

16:22.367 --> 16:24.494
l am not gonna boot up
this whole operation

16:24.569 --> 16:27.037
on the word
of that one girl.

16:27.105 --> 16:29.767
Ben.

16:29.841 --> 16:31.240
That is my decision!

16:31.310 --> 16:33.778
Well, it's the wrong decision.

16:33.845 --> 16:37.008
l order you
to stay away from her.

16:38.684 --> 16:41.278
Sorry, Max, l'm not
following that order.

16:41.353 --> 16:42.650
Ben!

16:42.721 --> 16:44.951
You can't break Plumber ranks!

16:45.023 --> 16:48.686
Max, don't let him
do this.

16:48.760 --> 16:50.819
lt's not up to me.

16:50.896 --> 16:53.091
He's made his choice.

16:53.165 --> 16:55.895
Kev?

16:55.967 --> 16:58.527
Somebody's gotta stay here
and look after the old man.

16:58.603 --> 17:00.468
Kevin! Stop him!

17:00.539 --> 17:02.029
Don't worry.

17:02.107 --> 17:04.769
l can handle myself.

17:26.798 --> 17:28.265
What do you want?

17:28.333 --> 17:30.597
The same thing as you...
l wanna help you find him.

17:30.669 --> 17:32.330
What about your Gramps?

17:32.404 --> 17:33.962
Not too thrilled about it.

17:34.039 --> 17:36.667
And you're helping me
anyway?

17:38.410 --> 17:40.435
Nice bike.

17:40.512 --> 17:42.537
lt's Max's really.

17:42.614 --> 17:44.980
Can't get any more angry with me
than he already is.

17:45.050 --> 17:47.985
l'm sorry.
That's my fault.

17:48.053 --> 17:50.078
Nah, it's his.

17:50.155 --> 17:51.782
Let's find your dad.

17:51.857 --> 17:53.791
First stop.. wherever you got
your hands on those chips.

18:09.741 --> 18:12.073
Grandpa.

18:16.047 --> 18:18.379
Am l interrupting something?

18:18.450 --> 18:19.781
Find your wayward cousin?

18:19.851 --> 18:21.478
He'll be back...

18:21.553 --> 18:23.680
alone, hopefully.

18:23.755 --> 18:25.552
Yeah, so what's the 41 1
on those two?

18:25.624 --> 18:29.685
Elena was Ben's first crush.

18:29.761 --> 18:32.457
She was the only girl on his
soccer team in middle school,

18:32.531 --> 18:34.465
and Ben couldn't kick a ball
in a straight line

18:34.533 --> 18:36.023
when she was around.

18:36.101 --> 18:39.332
He was really bummed out
after she moved away.

18:39.404 --> 18:41.269
Great,

18:41.339 --> 18:42.863
so now it's puppy love.

18:42.941 --> 18:44.568
Cousin Ben's growing up.

18:44.643 --> 18:46.110
lt had to happen
some time.

18:46.178 --> 18:48.146
Yeah, l'll believe that
when l see it.

18:48.213 --> 18:49.771
lnvalid codec.

18:49.848 --> 18:53.113
Access to mainframe
denied.

18:53.185 --> 18:57.315
Kev, what are you doing
in Max's office?

18:57.389 --> 19:00.119
l wanted to know what intel
we already had on those chips.

19:00.192 --> 19:01.853
lf Validus took them
from a vault,

19:01.927 --> 19:03.394
they should be in the system.

19:03.462 --> 19:04.952
And?

19:05.030 --> 19:07.225
All the files
are sealed.

19:07.299 --> 19:08.789
Well, then you should
just ask Max.

19:08.867 --> 19:11.028
l tried that.
He wasn't open to discussion.

19:11.102 --> 19:12.933
So you just came in here

19:13.004 --> 19:15.438
and opened up
his personal files?

19:16.508 --> 19:17.873
What did they say?

19:17.943 --> 19:21.174
They're sort of locked.

19:21.246 --> 19:24.443
l could figure out
the password?

19:24.516 --> 19:27.007
That would be a huge
violation of trust.

19:27.085 --> 19:28.848
And regulations.

19:28.920 --> 19:31.855
Well, l guess Ben is
really on his own this time.

19:31.923 --> 19:34.858
l'm sure he'll be fine.

19:34.926 --> 19:37.451
l mean, he's all grown up
now and everything.

19:41.099 --> 19:44.091
Break the code.

19:47.939 --> 19:50.305
Now implementing search
for variable internodes

19:50.375 --> 19:53.833
based on random
numeric ciphers.

19:58.016 --> 20:00.644
Don't worry.

20:00.719 --> 20:03.882
Yes, yes,
our tests are all complete.

20:03.955 --> 20:07.789
Please, we must know.
ls it time?

20:07.859 --> 20:09.224
Oh, yeah, pal,
it's time.

20:09.294 --> 20:11.455
Time for you
to give us your money.

20:13.298 --> 20:16.096
Hey, we're talking to you,
loony toon.

20:16.167 --> 20:18.294
Don't you know this is
a bad part of town?

20:18.370 --> 20:21.066
You shouldn't be out here
walking all alone.

20:21.139 --> 20:23.198
Alone?
We are not alone.

20:23.275 --> 20:25.140
We are never alone.

20:25.210 --> 20:27.110
Your wallet, fool!

20:27.178 --> 20:29.146
We offer you so much more
than money.

20:29.214 --> 20:31.512
We offer you
a new life!

20:31.583 --> 20:33.551
Join us!

20:33.618 --> 20:36.143
Help us!

20:36.221 --> 20:38.212
Rule with us!

21:46.191 --> 21:47.852
My dad started acting
really weird

21:47.926 --> 21:49.359
a couple months ago.

21:49.427 --> 21:52.624
l followed him one night
to this place.

21:52.697 --> 21:56.428
Well, hanging out around here
certainly classifies as weird.

22:01.573 --> 22:04.235
That's a good girl.

22:04.309 --> 22:06.334
Bring him here to us.

22:06.411 --> 22:09.209
He can't help you now.

22:27.432 --> 22:30.492
What was he doing,
racing cockroaches?

22:30.568 --> 22:32.468
He has a laboratory set up.

22:32.537 --> 22:34.801
Whatever he was working on,
he didn't want me involved.

22:34.873 --> 22:37.239
Then he stopped
coming home at all.

22:37.308 --> 22:39.299
Come on.

23:12.143 --> 23:15.738
To the final staging area.

23:15.814 --> 23:18.442
Take care of our guests.

23:25.557 --> 23:27.718
What was he
doing here?

23:27.792 --> 23:29.783
He was studying
the chips.

23:32.997 --> 23:34.589
Boy, when your dad
takes up a hobby,

23:34.666 --> 23:36.463
he doesn't mess around.

23:36.534 --> 23:38.593
Someone's been here...

23:38.670 --> 23:42.436
taking things.

23:42.507 --> 23:44.771
Or looking for things.

23:44.843 --> 23:47.004
Elena, these notes,

23:47.078 --> 23:48.978
he wasn't studying the chips,

23:49.047 --> 23:50.810
he was upgrading,
developing them.

23:50.882 --> 23:53.214
Look at all this.
Your dad was crazy.

23:53.284 --> 23:55.184
You're wrong.

23:55.253 --> 23:58.154
He's a brilliant man, he just
became possessed by his work.

24:00.191 --> 24:01.385
Why?

24:01.459 --> 24:03.586
He said these things
posed some kind of threat.

24:03.661 --> 24:06.129
The Plumbers didn't believe him,
so he took them.

24:06.197 --> 24:09.166
Now they won't lift
a finger to help him.

24:10.235 --> 24:13.432
And Max is kind of a stickler
about the Plumber rulebook.

24:15.640 --> 24:19.371
This is where l found those
chips in storage canisters.

24:19.444 --> 24:23.210
They were all over the place.

24:23.281 --> 24:25.545
Looks like your dad
had business with Ship-lt.

24:25.617 --> 24:28.211
You think he could have
sent the chips somewhere?

24:28.286 --> 24:32.780
Well, whoever has your dad
wanted these chips.

24:32.857 --> 24:35.519
The freak from the drop.

24:35.593 --> 24:37.254
Do you know who that is?

24:37.328 --> 24:38.886
l have no idea.

24:38.963 --> 24:41.193
l just want my father back, Ben.

24:41.266 --> 24:43.291
We'll get him.
l promise.

24:49.741 --> 24:53.370
Who are you?
What do you want?

24:53.444 --> 24:55.742
We want to help you.

24:55.814 --> 24:58.942
No thanks, we're good.
Just browsing.

24:59.017 --> 25:02.180
Whoa, look at their eyes.

25:02.253 --> 25:03.880
lt's not just their eyes.

25:03.955 --> 25:06.389
Look, the chips.

25:06.457 --> 25:08.357
They're infected.
They're being controlled.

25:08.426 --> 25:10.986
We want you
to meet the queen.

25:11.062 --> 25:12.427
And we would love
to do that,

25:12.497 --> 25:16.092
but all the bowing
and curtsying, l don't think so.

25:16.167 --> 25:18.601
There's too many of 'em,
like they were expecting us...

25:18.670 --> 25:20.695
like this is a trap.

25:20.772 --> 25:22.364
No, l swear it!

25:22.440 --> 25:25.637
Looks like we could
use some help.

25:25.710 --> 25:30.113
From a static squiggly blob?
Not good.

25:30.181 --> 25:32.308
Fire escape! Run!

25:34.586 --> 25:36.110
Ben!

25:37.088 --> 25:38.851
Whoa!

25:47.198 --> 25:48.460
No!

25:48.533 --> 25:49.830
What do we do?

25:49.901 --> 25:51.892
Okay, l think l got it.

25:51.970 --> 25:53.460
So if these chips are
actually alive,

25:53.538 --> 25:55.301
like some form
of techno-organic interface,

25:55.373 --> 25:57.398
then the watch must
be in overdrive to scan 'em.

25:57.475 --> 25:59.875
Can we have this pop quiz
another time?

25:59.944 --> 26:01.673
Maybe l can redirect the scan
back at the chips,

26:01.746 --> 26:03.646
if l can just boost the power.

26:03.715 --> 26:06.878
l got it!

26:08.686 --> 26:10.984
Hey, not bad.

26:11.055 --> 26:13.353
Not great, either.
Come on, let's go!

26:29.107 --> 26:31.905
Elena, get on!

26:49.160 --> 26:50.855
Thanks.

26:50.929 --> 26:52.726
You're pretty good
on this thing.

26:52.797 --> 26:55.027
And you can hold your own
in a fight.

26:55.099 --> 26:56.964
So what do we do now?

26:57.035 --> 26:59.026
Visit the shipment center
and find out what your
dad was up to.

26:59.103 --> 27:00.695
Maybe even find your dad.

27:00.772 --> 27:02.740
Whatever he sent
is long gone now.

27:02.807 --> 27:05.332
You sure about that?

27:05.410 --> 27:07.310
This was dated today.

27:07.378 --> 27:09.073
l thought you said he's been
missing for weeks.

27:09.147 --> 27:10.876
He has.

27:10.949 --> 27:13.247
You believe me, don't you?

27:13.318 --> 27:15.809
l believe...

27:15.887 --> 27:18.685
we'll find something
at the Ship-lt.

27:20.491 --> 27:23.085
Who were you gonna
sell the chips to, Victor?

27:23.161 --> 27:24.822
l keep telling you...

27:24.896 --> 27:28.161
l had to take them.
lt was for research.

27:28.232 --> 27:31.030
Those chips,
they're a threat.

27:31.102 --> 27:32.967
They're planning something.

27:33.037 --> 27:35.403
That is a lie!
They're dead!

27:35.473 --> 27:38.067
The lab boys said they're
nothing but alien tech,

27:38.142 --> 27:41.236
no threat at all.

27:41.312 --> 27:42.210
Who's your buyer?

27:42.280 --> 27:44.214
The hive, they want us!

27:44.282 --> 27:46.147
They're coming for us, Max!

27:46.217 --> 27:47.707
They're coming for us all!

27:47.785 --> 27:49.776
l'm telling you
the truth, Max!

27:49.854 --> 27:52.755
You're gonna have to do
better than that, Victor.

27:52.824 --> 27:56.055
l know you.

27:56.127 --> 27:59.290
Gramps has a great
bedside manner there, Gwen.

27:59.364 --> 28:01.730
Validus was like,
his prized pupil.

28:01.799 --> 28:04.461
l think Max really felt
his betrayal.

28:04.535 --> 28:07.800
l wonder if...

28:07.872 --> 28:09.237
You think Max's getting
stabbed in the back

28:09.307 --> 28:11.468
is keeping him
from seeing straight?

28:11.542 --> 28:12.736
That would make...

28:12.810 --> 28:14.471
Ben right.

28:14.545 --> 28:16.877
And that's a scary thought.

28:16.948 --> 28:18.438
And not just because
l hate it when he's right.

28:18.516 --> 28:21.314
So, what if this loony
isn't so loony?

28:21.386 --> 28:23.911
What if the chips
weren't dead?

28:23.988 --> 28:26.650
Like, some kind of
species of insects

28:26.724 --> 28:29.591
that can remain dormant
for decades.

28:29.660 --> 28:32.220
l learned that from watching
The Science Channel.

28:32.296 --> 28:34.423
Your depth of knowledge
astounds.

28:34.499 --> 28:38.299
Now commencing thermal and
spatial analysis of all targets.

28:38.369 --> 28:40.599
Have any luck getting a trace
on their energy signature?

28:40.671 --> 28:42.696
Your wish was my...

28:42.774 --> 28:45.242
headache inducing project.

28:45.309 --> 28:47.709
Targets identified.

28:47.779 --> 28:51.180
Absolute locations displayed
in a radial curve,

28:51.249 --> 28:53.581
commencing at 38 degrees
latitude...

28:53.651 --> 28:55.642
The chips are showing up
in a 100-mile radius.

28:55.720 --> 28:59.451
96 degrees longitude.

28:59.524 --> 29:02.015
Kevin! You did it!

29:04.228 --> 29:05.752
The cheek?

29:05.830 --> 29:07.422
l find all
the big bad alien chips,

29:07.498 --> 29:10.023
and all l get is a kiss
on the cheek?

29:10.101 --> 29:12.399
Greatest
concentration of chips...

29:12.470 --> 29:15.667
is clustered here.

29:15.740 --> 29:19.107
lt's the Ship-lt distribution
center.

29:19.177 --> 29:22.203
lt's only about an hour
from here.

29:22.280 --> 29:24.441
Are you thinking
what l'm thinking?

29:24.515 --> 29:26.346
That we're going against orders

29:26.417 --> 29:28.078
and are no better
than Ben.

29:28.152 --> 29:31.713
You had to mention it.

29:31.789 --> 29:36.385
Destination at absolute distance
of 49.87 miles.

29:42.967 --> 29:44.628
Come on, it's open.

29:44.702 --> 29:45.634
lt's open, huh?

29:45.703 --> 29:47.637
lt's open now.

29:53.644 --> 29:57.239
Remind me why we drove
all the way out here again.

30:18.336 --> 30:20.736
They were here, Kev.
We're too late.

30:27.912 --> 30:30.107
Yeah.

30:30.181 --> 30:32.741
That's what l get, too.

30:38.689 --> 30:41.715
And there's, like,
nothing here anymore.

30:41.792 --> 30:44.056
There's something.

30:44.128 --> 30:46.688
Let's check it out.

30:50.268 --> 30:52.634
London, Paris, Shanghai.

30:52.703 --> 30:54.534
These orders originated
from this location,

30:54.605 --> 30:56.368
and are headed
all over the world.

30:56.440 --> 30:57.407
Literally.

30:57.475 --> 30:59.909
Air, sea,
by every means, they have.

30:59.977 --> 31:03.572
Must be thousands
of crate orders.

31:03.648 --> 31:06.412
Maybe 100,000.

31:06.484 --> 31:10.614
Kevin, what do you think
it means?

31:10.688 --> 31:12.622
lt means we're at least
one step behind

31:12.690 --> 31:14.817
something disturbingly huge.

31:14.892 --> 31:16.917
May l help you?

31:16.994 --> 31:19.588
Um, hi,
we just had a few questions.

31:19.664 --> 31:22.030
Ship-lt is closed right now.

31:22.099 --> 31:24.863
Please return during
regular business hours.

31:24.936 --> 31:27.404
And what are you
doing here in the dark?

31:27.471 --> 31:29.871
We are workers.
We live to obey.

31:29.941 --> 31:33.001
Well, you must be
employee of the month.

31:35.079 --> 31:37.639
Look, Mister, we just need
to take some of these documents

31:37.715 --> 31:39.774
for a little
school project.

31:39.850 --> 31:41.647
l'll bring 'em right back
after we turn in our report.

31:41.719 --> 31:42.549
Okay?

31:42.620 --> 31:45.919
No, you will remain.
You will join us.

31:45.990 --> 31:48.925
l'm gonna have to insist.

31:48.993 --> 31:50.927
Your desires are irrelevant.

31:50.995 --> 31:53.589
The queen's will supersedes all.

31:53.664 --> 31:57.191
Well, tell your queen
to supersede this.

32:14.919 --> 32:18.013
What's that weirdo doing?

32:20.858 --> 32:22.416
Don't know.

32:22.493 --> 32:24.120
Praying to the great god
of bubble wrap?

32:24.195 --> 32:27.130
Kevin!

32:27.198 --> 32:29.928
Okay, these chips are now
officially an issue.

32:30.001 --> 32:31.559
That's new.

32:31.636 --> 32:33.331
They couldn't form
solid shapes before.

32:33.404 --> 32:35.702
Could the chips be learning?

32:37.208 --> 32:39.335
Come on, not the glass!
That's custom!

32:39.410 --> 32:43.506
Let's get out of here!

32:43.581 --> 32:46.015
Thank you for using
Ship-lt.

32:56.294 --> 32:58.785
You should teach
a driving class.

32:58.863 --> 33:01.855
Defensive drivers
are the safest drivers.

33:10.941 --> 33:15.071
Looks like we have
company.

33:25.623 --> 33:27.784
l think they're
getting smarter.

33:27.858 --> 33:30.759
Then so will we.

33:59.357 --> 34:03.316
Okay, so we gotta get smarter
and faster.

34:24.681 --> 34:25.978
Watch out!

34:34.658 --> 34:37.684
The Ship-lt office
is right up over here.

34:39.163 --> 34:41.654
What was that?

34:41.732 --> 34:44.132
The most obnoxious muscle car
in the world.

34:44.201 --> 34:46.498
We're taking a detour.

34:56.514 --> 34:57.879
l can't lose 'em!

35:05.456 --> 35:07.981
Kevin, no!

35:09.560 --> 35:11.687
Hang on!

35:44.094 --> 35:45.959
Are you okay?

35:46.030 --> 35:47.827
Yeah.

35:47.898 --> 35:49.695
lt hurts when l laugh,

35:49.767 --> 35:52.258
but l don't think
that'll be a problem.

35:52.336 --> 35:55.032
l don't know who's behind
all this,

35:55.105 --> 35:58.040
but they're gonna fix my car!

36:07.751 --> 36:08.945
You think they gave up?

36:09.019 --> 36:12.113
l don't know.

36:12.189 --> 36:14.555
Maybe they just wanted
to scare us.

36:17.094 --> 36:19.688
Well, they succeeded.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.038
Nice timing.

37:27.364 --> 37:30.060
That's kinda whatev.

37:31.068 --> 37:33.298
That's kind of a nightmare.

38:06.136 --> 38:08.001
lt's got Humongusaur!

38:08.072 --> 38:10.302
l wouldn't count on it.

38:17.448 --> 38:20.042
Oh, no.

38:20.117 --> 38:23.450
Don't do what l think
you're gonna do.

38:46.977 --> 38:48.945
That was so cool.

38:49.013 --> 38:50.446
Are you okay, Ben?

38:50.514 --> 38:51.572
You destroyed my car!

38:51.649 --> 38:52.809
What were you doing here?

38:52.883 --> 38:55.078
Well, l had a sudden urge
to ship something overnight,

38:55.152 --> 38:57.586
and suddenly we're up to our
neck in your girlfriend's chips.

38:57.655 --> 38:59.486
And that's right about the time
you came along

38:59.556 --> 39:02.218
and annihilated my car!

39:02.292 --> 39:04.658
Those chips aren't mine!
l was trying to warn you!

39:04.728 --> 39:06.161
Thanks.

39:06.230 --> 39:08.198
l'll consider myself warned.

39:08.265 --> 39:09.892
They're more than just
autonomous tech.

39:09.967 --> 39:12.265
We found a hive of them
at the Ship-lt office,

39:12.336 --> 39:15.772
and they've infected
the clerk.. absorbed him.

39:15.839 --> 39:17.739
Yeah, we just ran into
his extended family

39:17.808 --> 39:18.934
and they wanted to adopt us.

39:19.009 --> 39:20.374
No kidding.

39:20.444 --> 39:23.140
They must have analyzed
the threat and evolved.

39:23.213 --> 39:25.238
They're clearly a highly
adaptive species.

39:25.315 --> 39:28.648
And it looks like they still
have some life left in them.

39:28.719 --> 39:30.380
We've gotta get some
of these active chips

39:30.454 --> 39:31.921
back to the lab right away.

39:31.989 --> 39:34.150
Maybe they'll give us a clue about
what happened to my father.

39:34.224 --> 39:35.987
Maybe we'll give you a call

39:36.060 --> 39:37.960
because you're not
coming with us.

39:38.028 --> 39:39.928
You're trouble in a jug.

39:39.997 --> 39:42.090
Oh, l'm coming with you,
all right.

39:42.166 --> 39:44.794
Ben, didn't Elena just
lead you into a nest

39:44.868 --> 39:47.166
of techno-organic zombies?

39:47.237 --> 39:48.966
She's coming.

39:49.039 --> 39:51.007
One.. she's in too much danger
on her own now.

39:51.075 --> 39:53.373
And two...

39:53.444 --> 39:55.605
l trust her.

39:58.882 --> 40:00.975
Speaking of which.

40:03.854 --> 40:06.789
What's that?

40:06.857 --> 40:09.917
A quick and trustworthy
cab service.

40:17.234 --> 40:20.032
This is an all-point alert
from field operative 219.

40:20.104 --> 40:22.834
Escalating incidents of
an unidentifiable nature,

40:22.906 --> 40:24.373
presumed alien.

40:24.441 --> 40:25.840
Request immediate assistance.

40:39.223 --> 40:41.418
Where in the Sam Hill
has everybody been?

40:41.492 --> 40:43.687
l'm getting reports
on alien activity

40:43.761 --> 40:46.457
from installed Plumbers
all over the globe!

40:46.530 --> 40:47.827
Max, l...

40:47.898 --> 40:49.832
We can settle our problems
later.

40:49.900 --> 40:52.061
And she stays in the brig.

40:52.136 --> 40:54.570
lt's the chips...
Validus' chips.

40:54.638 --> 40:56.606
She told you that?

40:56.673 --> 40:58.106
lt's true.

40:58.175 --> 41:00.109
The chips Validus stole
have become active.

41:00.177 --> 41:03.169
Very active.

41:07.985 --> 41:12.149
These things were nothing more
than extraterrestrial hardware.

41:12.222 --> 41:13.951
This is impossible.

41:14.024 --> 41:15.855
They also have a nasty habit
of burrowing into people

41:15.926 --> 41:17.450
and taking over their minds.

41:17.528 --> 41:20.190
They have an unusual energy
signature.

41:20.264 --> 41:22.095
Can you use that
to pinpoint it?

41:22.166 --> 41:23.599
Already done.

41:23.667 --> 41:25.430
Targets reanalyzed.

41:25.502 --> 41:28.300
Absolute locations appear
in a radial curve.

41:28.372 --> 41:31.102
Target is experiencing
exponential growth

41:31.175 --> 41:33.871
at an absolute rate
of 10,000 to 1

41:33.944 --> 41:35.707
on an ascendant curve.

41:35.779 --> 41:39.180
That's no 100-mile radius.

41:39.249 --> 41:40.409
Millions of 'em.

41:40.484 --> 41:42.850
And spreading
at an increasing rate.

41:42.920 --> 41:44.547
So in other words,
they are a threat,

41:44.621 --> 41:46.680
just like my father said.

41:46.757 --> 41:49.055
Those things were not alive
three years ago.

41:49.126 --> 41:51.959
Your father's tinkering
probably activated 'em somehow.

41:52.029 --> 41:54.054
Now they're a threat
to the entire world.

41:54.131 --> 41:55.894
You're wrong.
They were hibernating.

41:55.966 --> 41:57.433
Just ask your know-it-all
granddaughter.

41:57.501 --> 41:59.196
Knock it off, both of you.

41:59.269 --> 42:02.898
Let's work on a solution,
not blame.

42:02.973 --> 42:06.204
Well...

42:06.276 --> 42:08.403
at least we know
where they are.

42:08.478 --> 42:09.877
Well, what are we
waiting for,

42:09.947 --> 42:11.881
let's start shooting.

42:11.949 --> 42:14.247
What about the people
who are already infected?

42:14.318 --> 42:16.616
lf it's between me
and a Ship-lt clerk,

42:16.687 --> 42:18.314
l'm gonna pick me.

42:18.388 --> 42:21.084
No, Kev, there's gotta be
another way.

42:22.192 --> 42:24.023
- The queen.
- What?

42:24.094 --> 42:25.061
That's right.

42:25.128 --> 42:27.722
The infected people, they all
went on about their queen.

42:27.798 --> 42:31.325
You mean a queen like
in an insect colony?

42:31.401 --> 42:34.336
ln a beehive or anthill,
there's only one queen.

42:34.404 --> 42:36.838
She lays all the eggs,
produces all the offspring,

42:36.907 --> 42:39.205
and tells everybody
what to do.

42:40.310 --> 42:43.040
The Science Channel.

42:43.113 --> 42:45.138
How do you destroy a hive?

42:45.215 --> 42:47.740
Remove the queen,
the bees disband.

42:47.818 --> 42:50.309
The queen dies,
the hive dies.

42:50.387 --> 42:54.448
We have to find the queen.

42:54.524 --> 42:56.583
All right, people,
nobody sleeps tonight.

42:56.660 --> 42:59.652
l'm gonna dissect these chips
to see what they're made of.

42:59.730 --> 43:00.788
Kevin, we need to find

43:00.864 --> 43:02.855
a more effective way around
those drones.

43:02.933 --> 43:05.663
Gwen, find a way
to disrupt the connection

43:05.736 --> 43:08.398
between those things
and their human host.

43:08.472 --> 43:11.100
Ben, they're 100 million chips
out there.

43:11.174 --> 43:13.267
Gonna be like finding
a needle in a haystack

43:13.343 --> 43:15.937
to find the queen in there,
but get on it.

43:16.013 --> 43:18.504
Now, Elena,
since you're here,

43:18.582 --> 43:20.550
you'll help too.

43:20.617 --> 43:23.780
l don't want her going two feet
without an escort.

43:32.396 --> 43:36.890
Okay, people,
let's move!

43:40.938 --> 43:45.466
My calculations recommend
point-specific analysis

43:45.542 --> 43:48.534
gradient to regional
demographics

43:48.612 --> 43:52.013
as related to current
geographic coordinates.

43:52.082 --> 43:54.812
Now commencing thermal
and spatial analysis

43:54.885 --> 43:56.443
of all targets.

43:56.520 --> 44:00.081
Duration...

44:17.341 --> 44:18.933
Gwen, why don't you get
some shut-eye?

44:19.009 --> 44:21.637
We need that brain of yours
working if things get hot.

44:21.712 --> 44:23.942
Just for a few minutes.

44:24.014 --> 44:26.642
And you'd better wake me up.

44:29.152 --> 44:31.086
You too, get some rest.

44:31.154 --> 44:32.849
No chance.

44:32.923 --> 44:34.948
l'll sleep when my dad is home
safe and sound.

44:35.025 --> 44:37.016
Suit yourself.

44:41.565 --> 44:43.396
Thanks, Ben...

44:43.467 --> 44:46.197
for taking the risk
to help me,

44:46.269 --> 44:49.136
for going up against
the team.

44:49.206 --> 44:51.071
Just like old times, right.

44:51.141 --> 44:52.733
The guys didn't want you
on the soccer team

44:52.809 --> 44:54.743
and l stood up to them
for you to join.

44:54.811 --> 44:57.541
You ended up being
our MVP.

44:57.614 --> 45:00.378
You're not doing this
for old times' sake.

45:00.450 --> 45:03.146
No, l'm doing it
because l know what it's like

45:03.220 --> 45:05.154
to be on your own

45:05.222 --> 45:08.988
in a tough situation
you never chose to be in.

45:09.059 --> 45:11.425
l didn't ask to get
stuck with this.

45:11.495 --> 45:13.986
lt just happened.

45:14.064 --> 45:18.160
And no one who isn't me
knows how that feels.

45:18.235 --> 45:21.033
l think l do.

45:32.482 --> 45:35.212
Max, we need help
with a map analysis.

45:42.092 --> 45:44.026
Max?

45:48.832 --> 45:50.766
Snap out of it, Max!
lt's Ben!

45:50.834 --> 45:53.530
Ben, stop! Max!

45:53.603 --> 45:56.003
We have to restrain him,
but be careful not to...

46:00.143 --> 46:03.442
Hurt him.

46:03.513 --> 46:04.673
What?

46:04.748 --> 46:07.615
He's restrained.

46:10.620 --> 46:13.851
Max, are you okay?

46:13.924 --> 46:16.222
We're fine.

46:16.293 --> 46:18.523
Never better.

46:18.595 --> 46:21.860
Why are you all looking
at us like that?

46:21.932 --> 46:25.026
We're great.

46:25.102 --> 46:26.535
We're happy.

46:26.603 --> 46:29.766
We're going to colonize earth.

46:29.840 --> 46:32.035
He usually has a lot
of odd jobs for us.

46:32.109 --> 46:34.043
But that one's new.

46:34.111 --> 46:35.078
Grandpa!

46:35.145 --> 46:36.669
Fight it, Max!
Come on!

46:36.746 --> 46:39.112
You can't stop
what's coming.

46:39.182 --> 46:43.619
The Plumbers are finished.

46:43.687 --> 46:46.986
Mankind is finished.

46:48.458 --> 46:50.426
Max!

46:50.494 --> 46:53.156
Max!

46:54.164 --> 46:56.928
Where did he go?

46:59.369 --> 47:00.996
No one knows these tunnels
like Max.

47:01.071 --> 47:02.299
He's long gone.

47:02.372 --> 47:03.669
Now what?

47:03.740 --> 47:05.731
Like it or not,
he usually tells us what to do.

47:05.809 --> 47:06.901
We need him.

47:06.977 --> 47:09.605
No, we don't.
He needs us.

47:09.679 --> 47:11.670
We have to find the queen
and stop her.

47:11.748 --> 47:14.239
Helping Max is gonna be
the least of our problems.

47:14.317 --> 47:15.511
Wherever the alien queen is,

47:15.585 --> 47:17.485
that's where we'll find
your father and Max.

47:17.554 --> 47:19.419
We stop her, we stop the spread
of these chips.

47:19.489 --> 47:22.253
And just how do you suggest
we do that?

47:25.495 --> 47:27.429
Current geographic coordinates.

47:27.497 --> 47:29.965
Does anything seem weird to you
guys about this map?

47:30.033 --> 47:32.058
Color choices are
a bit drab.

47:32.135 --> 47:35.002
Try sea foam blue.

47:35.071 --> 47:36.868
Check out the concentration
of the chips...

47:36.940 --> 47:38.635
London, New York, Paris,

47:38.708 --> 47:39.834
Munich,

47:39.910 --> 47:41.207
and central Missouri?

47:41.278 --> 47:42.609
There are millions of people
in all those cities,

47:42.679 --> 47:44.544
but that part of Missouri is...

47:44.614 --> 47:46.172
The middle of nowhere.

47:46.249 --> 47:48.547
lt's barely a town.

47:48.618 --> 47:51.348
The only thing in Barren Rock
is...

47:51.421 --> 47:55.118
The world distribution center
for Ship-lt.

47:56.760 --> 47:58.318
Right!

47:58.395 --> 47:59.919
Those shipments from
the local hub would have been

47:59.996 --> 48:01.987
the first wave
of sentry soldiers.

48:02.065 --> 48:04.761
Now we're talking
total immersion.

48:04.834 --> 48:05.960
And they need
a big enough base

48:06.036 --> 48:08.231
to spread that many chips
across the entire planet.

48:08.305 --> 48:11.968
Come on, they're taking over
the world by 24-hour shipping?

48:12.042 --> 48:13.703
What's your brilliant theory?

48:13.777 --> 48:16.041
Look, l think that's
where the chips

48:16.112 --> 48:18.706
are being manufactured
and distributed.

48:18.782 --> 48:21.376
And that's where
we'll find the queen.

48:21.451 --> 48:23.180
Sounds like we're in
for a road trip.

48:23.253 --> 48:26.654
What do you mean, ''we''?

48:26.723 --> 48:29.351
Fine, she's coming.

48:29.426 --> 48:33.294
Now we just have
to figure out how...

48:33.363 --> 48:36.628
with Kev's car
out of commission.

48:40.237 --> 48:42.296
Kev made this
for your birthday present.

48:42.372 --> 48:44.169
My birthday was
two months ago.

48:44.241 --> 48:46.675
You can't rush genius.

48:50.480 --> 48:52.345
Oh, my gosh, Kevin.

48:52.415 --> 48:53.882
lt's beautiful!

48:53.950 --> 48:55.042
''She.''

48:55.118 --> 48:56.016
She's beautiful.

48:56.086 --> 48:58.646
You call a car a ''she.''

48:58.722 --> 49:00.690
And you're right.

49:00.757 --> 49:02.657
Don't be jealous,

49:02.726 --> 49:05.661
you've got some
good qualities, too.

49:05.729 --> 49:07.253
A car.

49:07.330 --> 49:09.298
Your friend built you
a car.

49:09.366 --> 49:11.800
Well, the weapons and defense
systems aren't online yet,

49:11.868 --> 49:13.460
but she'll run.

49:13.536 --> 49:17.233
Yeah, the fact is, she'll pretty
much eat anything in her path.

49:17.307 --> 49:18.672
l don't know what to say.

49:18.742 --> 49:20.107
l can't wait
to test her out.

49:20.176 --> 49:21.404
Oh, you're not driving.

49:21.478 --> 49:23.105
l said l was going
to give you the car.

49:23.179 --> 49:25.704
That was before you bailed out
on the team.

49:25.782 --> 49:26.840
l'm keeping her.

49:26.916 --> 49:30.010
- Oh, l'm driving.
- How do you figure?

49:30.086 --> 49:33.613
Humongusaur would be happy
to throw the car to Missouri.

49:58.882 --> 50:01.908
l like it.

50:01.985 --> 50:04.180
l'm thrilled.

50:19.135 --> 50:21.069
Missouri in February...

50:21.137 --> 50:23.935
a dream vacation,
only 40 degrees colder.

50:27.944 --> 50:30.572
Let me get a closer look.

50:34.117 --> 50:36.608
lt's like a small army...

50:36.686 --> 50:39.154
or not so small.

50:39.222 --> 50:41.986
Check it out.

50:42.058 --> 50:46.119
We're gonna be fighting
some serious odds down there.

50:46.196 --> 50:48.187
The people...

50:48.264 --> 50:51.097
they're all infected.

50:57.240 --> 50:58.434
Oops.

50:58.508 --> 51:00.738
That's coming out
of your zombie paycheck.

51:00.810 --> 51:03.836
All those crates
are filled with chips.

51:03.913 --> 51:06.381
God, there must be millions.

51:06.449 --> 51:08.144
Probably six billion.

51:08.218 --> 51:10.743
That's how many people
there are on earth.

51:10.820 --> 51:13.220
Okay, let's get inside.

51:29.005 --> 51:31.496
Looks like that's where
we wanna be,

51:31.574 --> 51:33.269
right in there.

51:34.277 --> 51:36.871
Oh, no!
Grandpa!

51:36.946 --> 51:38.140
Gwen, no.

51:38.214 --> 51:40.808
lf he sees us, he'll alert
the others we don't belong here.

51:40.884 --> 51:42.977
He's one of them now.
Hive mind.

51:43.052 --> 51:45.646
lt's up to us.

52:17.220 --> 52:20.417
lt's like a human assembly line.

52:27.997 --> 52:29.965
No sign of her royal highness,
the queen.

52:31.434 --> 52:33.994
There's someone
we know.

52:37.474 --> 52:40.602
lt's the creep
from back at the mill.

52:46.149 --> 52:48.379
That's Victor Validus.

52:50.453 --> 52:52.580
l knew it.
l told you not to trust her.

52:52.655 --> 52:54.589
lt's not like that.

52:54.657 --> 52:56.648
You knew your father
was behind this the whole time.

52:56.726 --> 52:57.988
You said you didn't
know that guy.

52:58.061 --> 52:59.323
l don't.

52:59.395 --> 53:02.364
That's not my dad.
He's become some kind of freak.

53:14.811 --> 53:16.335
Well...

53:16.412 --> 53:20.371
l think we found out how
they're making those chips.

53:20.450 --> 53:21.974
No.

53:24.153 --> 53:26.485
You expect me to believe
you're on our side?

53:26.556 --> 53:27.420
l knew not to trust you.

53:27.490 --> 53:29.321
No, you're wrong.
You don't understand.

53:29.392 --> 53:31.792
You've got a lot
of explaining to do.

53:31.861 --> 53:34.261
Not here, she doesn't.

53:46.109 --> 53:47.940
They're both in this together.
lt's a trap.

53:48.011 --> 53:50.172
- Back off! lt's okay!
- Yeah, how is this okay?

53:50.246 --> 53:52.146
Ben, her father is
reproducing those chips.

53:52.215 --> 53:53.739
He's the one controlling
this whole operation.

53:53.816 --> 53:54.874
ls he?

53:54.951 --> 53:56.384
lt looks like the chips
are controlling him,

53:56.452 --> 53:57.714
just like Max!

53:57.787 --> 53:59.778
lt's not a trap.

53:59.856 --> 54:01.346
l trusted you, Elena.

54:01.424 --> 54:04.052
l had to lie.
l knew you'd react like this.

54:04.127 --> 54:06.027
Refuse to help me,
treat me like the enemy,

54:06.095 --> 54:07.722
just like they did
to my father.

54:07.797 --> 54:10.265
Then l guess you don't
know us as well as you thought.

54:10.333 --> 54:12.460
Right?

54:12.535 --> 54:14.560
l'm sorry.

54:14.637 --> 54:16.036
l just wanted
this nightmare to end.

54:16.105 --> 54:17.663
Well...

54:17.740 --> 54:20.538
looks like it's just
beginning.

54:26.182 --> 54:28.343
So that's what those
plans were for.

54:28.418 --> 54:30.147
He was conducting tests
on himself.

54:30.219 --> 54:31.413
He's the hive.

54:31.487 --> 54:32.920
His own body is producing them
by the thousands,

54:32.989 --> 54:34.354
every minute.

54:34.424 --> 54:38.121
ln a colony, only the queen
can reproduce.

54:38.194 --> 54:40.560
So...

54:40.630 --> 54:43.190
The queen is
inside of my dad.

54:44.200 --> 54:46.259
We gotta shut 'em down, Ben.

54:46.336 --> 54:47.769
Destroy him,
destroy the queen.

54:47.837 --> 54:48.963
No! You can't!

54:49.038 --> 54:50.938
l'm sorry, Elena,
but Kevin may be right.

54:51.007 --> 54:53.237
lf it's a choice between one man
and the entire human race...

54:53.309 --> 54:54.936
You said you'd save him!

54:55.011 --> 54:55.875
lt's not his fault!

54:55.945 --> 54:57.606
He's being controlled
by the queen!

54:57.680 --> 54:59.807
Dude, l know this is hard,

54:59.882 --> 55:02.373
but unless you take out this guy,

55:02.452 --> 55:04.682
the whole world falls.

55:04.754 --> 55:08.121
You know what Max would do.

55:10.126 --> 55:12.287
l don't know what
Max would do,

55:12.362 --> 55:13.659
but l know what
l wouldn't do.

55:13.730 --> 55:15.994
l don't destroy victims,
l save them.

55:16.065 --> 55:19.865
What's your plan, Ben?

55:19.936 --> 55:23.099
lt looks like all
the soldier chips have been
rendered dormant for shipping.

55:23.172 --> 55:25.470
lf l stop the queen
before she can activate them,

55:25.541 --> 55:26.701
it looks like we have a chance
of beating this thing.

55:26.776 --> 55:28.073
Ben, wait a minute,
what do we do

55:28.144 --> 55:30.977
if Alien X or Humongusaur
gets absorbed by the hive?

55:31.047 --> 55:33.345
lt's all over.

55:34.617 --> 55:37.051
Absorbed by the hive is
pretty much what l had in mind.

55:39.389 --> 55:41.584
Remember when the Omnitrix
scanned the chips' DNA?

55:41.658 --> 55:43.751
l can fight them from the inside
if l become one of them.

55:43.826 --> 55:46.158
The watch has been cooking this
up the whole time.

55:46.229 --> 55:48.254
lt's time to take it out
of the oven.

55:48.331 --> 55:50.196
Ben, this isn't like anything
that you've become before.

55:50.266 --> 55:52.564
Kevin's right.
lt's a hive mind based organism.

55:52.635 --> 55:53.465
So?

55:53.536 --> 55:55.970
So, l think the Omnitrix can
turn you into one of these things,

55:56.039 --> 55:58.974
but l'm not so sure it can
keep you in control once it does.

55:59.042 --> 56:02.375
You may become a permanent
slave to the hive.

56:02.445 --> 56:05.710
A turbo-charged killer weapon
slave.

56:05.782 --> 56:07.306
Ben, no.

56:07.383 --> 56:09.214
l don't wanna lose you, too.

56:09.285 --> 56:11.253
We're out of options.

56:11.320 --> 56:13.481
l have to put my faith
in the Omnitrix.

56:13.556 --> 56:15.456
lt always has to be your way,
doesn't it, Ben?!

56:15.525 --> 56:17.686
Just like walking out
on the Plumbers.

56:17.760 --> 56:19.352
Okay, so maybe l should have
stayed and talked it out,

56:19.429 --> 56:20.555
but this is different.

56:20.630 --> 56:21.460
Why?

56:21.531 --> 56:22.520
This is something
l don't wanna do,

56:22.598 --> 56:23.895
l just don't see
any other way!

56:23.966 --> 56:24.990
Aaahh!

56:27.070 --> 56:28.537
Elena!

56:34.010 --> 56:36.171
Guys, look!

56:36.245 --> 56:37.473
Ben, what do you want
us to do?

56:37.547 --> 56:39.037
- Keep 'em busy.
- How?!

56:39.115 --> 56:41.049
l trust you.

56:44.487 --> 56:47.047
What?

56:51.260 --> 56:53.558
l'm small?

56:58.201 --> 56:59.463
What is that?

56:59.535 --> 57:02.231
He's turned into some kind of
nano-mechanical organism.

57:02.305 --> 57:04.967
Nano-mech. l like it.

57:05.041 --> 57:06.804
Just like the chips.

57:15.752 --> 57:18.152
Time to get small.

57:27.063 --> 57:29.497
Even smaller.

57:32.769 --> 57:34.999
This is gross!

57:37.540 --> 57:39.508
Listen to my voice.

57:39.575 --> 57:41.805
You must obey.

57:44.580 --> 57:50.644
You're one of us now,
Ben Tennyson.

57:50.720 --> 57:52.779
Aaaargh!

57:54.157 --> 57:57.149
Run!

58:04.934 --> 58:07.232
How can you care
about the humans,

58:07.303 --> 58:09.794
when the universe is yours?

58:09.872 --> 58:12.272
No!

58:58.387 --> 59:02.016
You're different
from these other drones.

59:02.091 --> 59:05.288
Stronger!

59:05.361 --> 59:10.060
Together, we can
rule everything!

59:10.132 --> 59:11.861
Sorry,

59:11.934 --> 59:15.802
l'm just not ready
for a serious commitment.

59:15.872 --> 59:17.669
Then you'll die...

59:17.740 --> 59:20.334
with the humans.

59:29.318 --> 59:30.979
Ow!

59:35.024 --> 59:37.185
What's Ben
doing in there?

59:37.260 --> 59:40.252
Whatever he's doing,
he'd better hurry up.

59:40.329 --> 59:42.889
The chips are
activating.

59:47.670 --> 59:50.332
You were a fool
to transform into a drone.

59:50.406 --> 59:54.672
l can easily defeat
any puny drone.

59:59.615 --> 01:00:02.584
l'm not just any drone!

01:00:02.652 --> 01:00:07.146
l'm half-drone,
half-human!

01:00:07.223 --> 01:00:10.021
Drones can adapt.

01:00:10.092 --> 01:00:14.324
And humans never give up.

01:00:37.787 --> 01:00:40.722
Oh!

01:01:05.581 --> 01:01:06.946
He did it!

01:01:11.053 --> 01:01:13.578
- Dad!
- Elena.

01:01:13.656 --> 01:01:15.647
He's alright!

01:01:17.793 --> 01:01:19.954
What am l,
chopped liver?

01:01:20.029 --> 01:01:21.656
Hello, l just saved
the world again.

01:01:21.731 --> 01:01:22.891
Don't look at me.

01:01:22.965 --> 01:01:26.401
l'm not hugging you.

01:01:26.469 --> 01:01:27.993
Actually, you might not
wanna hug me so tight.

01:01:28.070 --> 01:01:32.097
l flew through a lot
of snot.

01:01:32.174 --> 01:01:34.165
Max!

01:01:53.963 --> 01:01:55.931
Max!

01:01:55.998 --> 01:01:58.762
Max, where are you?!

01:01:58.834 --> 01:02:01.064
Grandpa!

01:02:01.137 --> 01:02:02.729
You've got a lot of gall...

01:02:02.805 --> 01:02:05.740
disobeying orders,
defying my authority.

01:02:05.808 --> 01:02:06.672
Grandpa, l...

01:02:06.742 --> 01:02:10.178
You know what that kind
of behavior gets you?!

01:02:40.242 --> 01:02:41.903
l'm sorry, Victor.

01:02:41.977 --> 01:02:43.376
None of this would have
ever happened

01:02:43.446 --> 01:02:45.004
if l had trusted you.

01:02:45.081 --> 01:02:47.549
No, Max, it wasn't right
to go it alone.

01:02:47.616 --> 01:02:51.882
Ben, thank you.
l'm forever grateful.

01:02:51.954 --> 01:02:52.978
You should be thanking
your daughter.

01:02:53.055 --> 01:02:54.147
lf it wasn't for Elena,

01:02:54.223 --> 01:02:55.747
l'd be at a school
football game right now.

01:02:55.825 --> 01:02:57.292
He's just being modest.

01:02:57.359 --> 01:03:00.590
Ben, modest?
lmpossible.

01:03:00.663 --> 01:03:02.597
l guess we make
a pretty good team.

01:03:02.665 --> 01:03:04.292
We make a great team.

01:03:04.366 --> 01:03:07.335
We're more than that,
we're Plumbers.

01:03:07.403 --> 01:03:10.600
And the Plumbers have
a pretty great leader.

01:03:10.673 --> 01:03:12.538
lndeed they do.

01:03:12.608 --> 01:03:16.009
Ben, what would you say
if l asked you to step in?

01:03:16.078 --> 01:03:17.773
What?

01:03:17.847 --> 01:03:20.111
Well, l'm not getting
any younger.

01:03:20.182 --> 01:03:24.141
And believe me, l've been
waiting for this moment
long enough.

01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:25.983
l couldn't take over.

01:03:26.055 --> 01:03:28.046
You already have,
in a way.

01:03:28.124 --> 01:03:31.287
That Omnitrix could have gone
to anybody's wrist.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.454
We just count ourselves lucky
that it found yours.

01:03:34.530 --> 01:03:39.024
l hate to say it,
but Max is right.

01:03:39.101 --> 01:03:42.002
Can we at least get
a 30-day trial period?

01:03:42.071 --> 01:03:44.471
Well, my first
order of business

01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:47.304
will be to unaccept
Max's resignation.

01:03:47.376 --> 01:03:49.742
Sorry, you're not getting out
of it that easy.

01:03:49.812 --> 01:03:51.575
Well, maybe you're right.

01:03:51.647 --> 01:03:57.244
What in blazes did
that zombie me do with my ride?

01:03:59.822 --> 01:04:01.813
What did you mean when
you said, ''we're a great team''?

01:04:01.891 --> 01:04:03.882
You are not on the team.

01:04:03.959 --> 01:04:04.948
l am now, red.

01:04:05.027 --> 01:04:07.723
l earned my place, and l suggest
you move your locker far away
from mine.

01:04:07.796 --> 01:04:08.990
Oh, l don't think so...

01:04:09.064 --> 01:04:10.725
You better get
used to that.

01:04:10.799 --> 01:04:12.824
lt's the sound
of things to come.

01:04:12.902 --> 01:04:14.335
Now give me back
my keys.

01:04:14.403 --> 01:04:16.633
Nice try, Kev.

01:04:16.705 --> 01:04:21.768
But from now on, l'm driving.

01:04:21.844 --> 01:04:24.039
l call shotgun.
