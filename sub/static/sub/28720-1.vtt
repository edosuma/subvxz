02:01.420 --> 02:03.386
I'll take your horse, sir.

02:03.388 --> 02:06.225
Bring me some ale, boy, please.

02:23.808 --> 02:26.510
We heard a theater burnt,
sir.

02:26.512 --> 02:28.978
Which one was it?

02:28.980 --> 02:31.347
Mine.

02:31.349 --> 02:35.952
You're Shakespeare,
the poet.

02:35.954 --> 02:37.787
You tell stories.

02:37.789 --> 02:39.091
I used to.

02:41.759 --> 02:46.098
I had a story,
but it was never finished.

02:47.399 --> 02:50.135
Will you finish it
for me, please?

02:51.370 --> 02:52.836
I'm done with stories, lad.

02:52.838 --> 02:54.674
I wouldn't know
how to finish yours.

02:58.443 --> 03:00.379
Yes, you would.

03:53.231 --> 03:55.367
Good night,
husband.

03:56.835 --> 03:59.904
Twenty years,
Will.

03:59.906 --> 04:04.074
We've seen you
less and less.

04:04.076 --> 04:07.543
To us,
you're a guest,

04:07.545 --> 04:10.847
and a guest must have
the best bed.

04:10.849 --> 04:12.618
Rest well.

04:24.262 --> 04:26.897
I always thought
he'd end his life in London.

04:26.899 --> 04:29.399
- It's where he lived.
- Doesn't matter where he lived

04:29.401 --> 04:31.435
or dies. All that matters
is who will be his heir.

04:31.437 --> 04:32.902
I am his heir,

04:32.904 --> 04:34.904
and our daughter,
Elizabeth, after me.

04:34.906 --> 04:37.940
Not if your sister
gives him a grandson.

04:37.942 --> 04:39.711
Or we do.

06:08.701 --> 06:11.804
I was thinking perhaps
I could make a garden.

06:12.771 --> 06:13.836
We've got a garden.

06:13.838 --> 06:15.639
I know,
but not a kitchen garden

06:15.641 --> 06:18.140
or a flower garden.

06:18.142 --> 06:22.146
A special garden
for Hamnet.

06:22.148 --> 06:25.818
Hamnet's in paradise.
He doesn't need a garden.

06:27.552 --> 06:29.454
Perhaps I do.

07:14.165 --> 07:17.433
Bit of a change
from making plays in London.

07:17.435 --> 07:19.370
Well, in some ways, Maria.

07:19.372 --> 07:22.505
In others,
really rather similar.

07:22.507 --> 07:24.774
Similar?
I don't see how.

07:24.776 --> 07:29.413
Well, like today,

07:29.415 --> 07:32.916
we take the measure
of our stage.

07:32.918 --> 07:34.918
A garden ain't a play.

07:34.920 --> 07:37.820
Yes, but play, garden,
loaf...

07:37.822 --> 07:40.656
Like the ones you bake
every morning.

07:40.658 --> 07:44.793
...all of them begin
with an idea

07:44.795 --> 07:46.195
from a compulsion

07:46.197 --> 07:50.067
to create
something of beauty

07:50.069 --> 07:51.567
or of need.

07:51.569 --> 07:53.771
Bread begins
with yeast and flour.

07:53.773 --> 07:56.038
Exactly. Ingredients.
Now you're getting me.

07:56.040 --> 08:01.110
Bushes, brambles, yeast,
flour versus players,

08:01.112 --> 08:04.447
and they all need a dream
which will not be denied,

08:04.449 --> 08:07.317
and which must weather
all kinds of adversity

08:07.319 --> 08:09.920
because the weather will turn,
the bugs will infest,

08:09.922 --> 08:12.522
the oven will cool,
the yeast will sour,

08:12.524 --> 08:15.791
and in my case,
your fellow workers,

08:15.793 --> 08:18.394
heh, like a brilliant
lunatic actor

08:18.396 --> 08:20.630
called Dick Burbage,
will interfere,

08:20.632 --> 08:22.867
and they will demand
a bigger show

08:23.999 --> 08:24.567
for a smaller budget,

08:24.569 --> 08:27.904
and a shorter play
with a much longer part for him,

08:27.906 --> 08:30.473
and all of these trials
must be overcome

08:30.475 --> 08:34.309
without ever losing sight
of the dream itself.

08:34.312 --> 08:37.480
And what does it feel like
when all of that works?

08:37.482 --> 08:40.684
Well, what does
freshly baked bread smell like?

08:53.999 --> 08:56.065
What on earth
are you doing here?

08:56.067 --> 08:59.068
Now, here's what I need you
not to pee on.

08:59.070 --> 09:00.671
This
is what you don't pee on,

09:00.673 --> 09:02.671
and this is what
you don't pee on here.

09:04.942 --> 09:06.812
Husband!

09:17.623 --> 09:21.023
Ooh. Thank you.

09:22.793 --> 09:25.329
Digging up roots
is heavy work.

09:25.331 --> 09:27.033
You'll find that.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.066
I once uprooted
an entire forest

09:30.068 --> 09:32.201
and moved it across the stage
to Dunsinane.

09:33.538 --> 09:35.875
Well, it's a bit different
in real life.

09:40.278 --> 09:42.881
He showed such promise,
Anne.

09:44.182 --> 09:45.549
You scarcely knew him.

09:45.551 --> 09:48.785
I knew him through his poems.

09:48.787 --> 09:51.588
- Well, you say "poems."
- Well, poems, yes.

09:51.590 --> 09:53.355
Childish scribble, perhaps,

09:53.357 --> 09:55.493
but wit and mischief
in every line.

09:58.964 --> 10:01.634
Well, he'll write no more.

10:03.134 --> 10:04.669
No.

10:07.505 --> 10:09.608
And nor will I.

10:12.443 --> 10:14.411
It's not Hamnet you mourn.

10:14.413 --> 10:16.081
It's yourself.

10:18.283 --> 10:19.882
I mourn my son.

10:19.884 --> 10:21.718
Now.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.923
You mourn him now.

10:25.691 --> 10:28.927
At the time, you wrote
<i>The Merry Wives of Windsor.</i>

10:35.799 --> 10:37.669
Yes, I did.

10:54.285 --> 10:56.786
<i>Well, it's an adjustment.</i>

10:56.788 --> 10:59.991
<i>She must learn to be a wife
once more.</i>

11:03.696 --> 11:06.329
My husband thinks
you've come home to die.

11:06.331 --> 11:07.498
- Really?
- Mm.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.065
I've just bought
a pension.

11:09.067 --> 11:10.666
I can't die
for at least 10 years

11:10.668 --> 11:12.270
or I'll be ruined.

11:16.607 --> 11:19.342
So why are you come home,
hmm?

11:19.344 --> 11:21.244
No more stories
left to write?

11:21.246 --> 11:24.480
Susanna, I've lived so long
in imaginary worlds,

11:24.482 --> 11:27.950
I think I've lost sight
of what is real,

11:27.952 --> 11:29.954
what is true.

11:31.322 --> 11:33.857
Judith says,
"Nothing is true."

11:33.859 --> 11:37.627
Judith is 28
and a spinster.

11:37.629 --> 11:39.831
That is true.

11:41.566 --> 11:44.533
When Father dies,
I shall be destitute.

11:44.535 --> 11:46.302
No, child.

11:46.304 --> 11:48.972
A third of his fortune
comes to me while I live.

11:48.974 --> 11:50.840
While you live.

11:50.842 --> 11:52.809
You're older than him,
remember?

11:52.811 --> 11:54.844
Well, Susanna
will never see you want.

11:54.846 --> 11:57.580
Susanna will obey
her husband.

11:57.582 --> 12:02.053
I will get nothing,
which is what I deserve.

12:04.755 --> 12:06.458
Judith.

12:07.926 --> 12:11.627
If you can't forgive
yourself,

12:11.629 --> 12:14.700
how do you expect God
to forgive you?

12:17.970 --> 12:19.772
I don't.

12:28.846 --> 12:31.680
I ran here
to this greenwood pond

12:31.682 --> 12:33.717
on the day I was sacked
from the school.

12:33.719 --> 12:35.219
I know, Father.

12:35.221 --> 12:36.820
You know,
the son of an alderman

12:36.822 --> 12:40.857
has a free education,
but the son of a thief...

12:40.859 --> 12:43.729
I thought my world
had ended.

12:44.962 --> 12:48.397
But I loved
this place.

12:48.399 --> 12:50.633
And you children
loved it too.

12:50.635 --> 12:52.268
Yes.

12:52.270 --> 12:55.173
Yeah, well,
we came here every day.

12:56.707 --> 12:59.743
Although Hamnet never went
in the water.

12:59.745 --> 13:01.243
No.

13:01.245 --> 13:04.281
He wasn't bold
like Judith.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.148
Or even...

13:06.150 --> 13:08.785
Even me.

13:08.787 --> 13:11.287
But his mind
was bold.

13:11.289 --> 13:14.523
I remember
he brought me here once

13:14.525 --> 13:16.725
to show me
what he had written.

13:16.727 --> 13:18.563
I told him then...

13:22.768 --> 13:25.734
that I was the proudest father
in the kingdom.

13:25.736 --> 13:27.405
I still am.

13:42.421 --> 13:44.223
Here, sweetheart.

13:48.092 --> 13:49.825
Your father's mind
is on his legacy.

13:49.827 --> 13:51.460
Your mind
is on his legacy.

13:51.462 --> 13:53.829
And therefore
must be yours.

13:53.831 --> 13:55.464
I'm your husband,

13:55.466 --> 13:57.870
and what concerns me
concerns you.

13:58.836 --> 14:00.505
It's good,
darling.

14:02.541 --> 14:03.973
Eat some more.

14:03.975 --> 14:06.276
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

14:20.793 --> 14:21.858
Husband!

14:21.860 --> 14:23.093
It's Sunday!

14:25.530 --> 14:27.531
Sunday?

14:27.533 --> 14:29.333
This isn't London.

14:29.335 --> 14:33.138
If you miss church here,
they'll fine you.

14:35.774 --> 14:37.641
Good morning.

14:37.643 --> 14:39.411
I'm pleased to see you.

14:58.864 --> 15:00.863
Shakespeare.

15:00.865 --> 15:04.834
Another Sunday, and still
you occupy your family pew.

15:04.836 --> 15:07.837
I pray you'll never
be obliged to vacate it,

15:07.839 --> 15:09.171
as your father was.

15:09.173 --> 15:11.907
I am not my father,
Sir Thomas.

15:36.100 --> 15:38.533
I joy to see you dig, sir.

15:38.535 --> 15:40.102
At last,
given up on your plays

15:40.104 --> 15:42.338
to distract the mob
from our Lord.

15:42.340 --> 15:45.574
Does the lark song distract you
from your God, John?

15:45.576 --> 15:46.709
Of course not.

15:46.711 --> 15:49.579
It is evidence of God.

15:49.581 --> 15:52.248
Ah. Well, then,

15:52.250 --> 15:56.754
perhaps for some,
I was the lark.

15:59.256 --> 16:00.956
Came to ask a favor,
Father-in-Law,

16:00.958 --> 16:03.325
but I'm loath to distract a man
from his labors.

16:03.327 --> 16:05.728
Will you call when you're done
with your garden?

16:05.730 --> 16:08.100
- Yes, I shall call, John.
- Thank you.

16:11.669 --> 16:13.637
Susanna is well, yes?

16:13.639 --> 16:15.972
- She's well, sir. Thank you.
- And Elizabeth?

16:15.974 --> 16:17.574
- Also well, sir. Thank you.
- Good.

16:17.576 --> 16:19.441
- I'm glad to hear it.
- Yes.

16:19.443 --> 16:22.111
Yes.

16:22.113 --> 16:23.849
Thank you, John.

16:28.620 --> 16:30.453
Good day to you,
Mrs. Hall.

16:30.455 --> 16:33.122
Tell your sister I have
a fine Rhenish wine delivered,

16:33.124 --> 16:34.791
and she may have
a bottle gratis,

16:34.793 --> 16:36.158
for just a single smile.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.993
I'll tell her, Tom.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.873
- Morning, Nina.
- Good morning, Mrs. Hall.

16:50.875 --> 16:53.077
Package for you. Frank.

16:56.147 --> 16:58.017
I'm sorry.

17:05.723 --> 17:07.224
Mercury, Mrs. Hall?

17:13.499 --> 17:15.065
My husband is a doctor.

17:15.067 --> 17:18.369
She said
the parcel was for you.

17:28.680 --> 17:30.013
Morning, Kate.

17:39.991 --> 17:41.356
Good day to you,
Mr. Smith.

17:41.358 --> 17:43.392
- Mrs. Hall.
- I need cloth.

17:43.394 --> 17:46.796
A loose weave,
to make a summer dress, black.

17:46.798 --> 17:49.798
Black? For summer?

17:49.800 --> 17:51.834
Perhaps this blue.

17:51.836 --> 17:54.336
My husband does not approve
of fancy stuff.

17:54.338 --> 17:56.238
If your husband had his way,
Mrs. Hall,

17:56.240 --> 17:58.341
my shop would be
a very dull place.

17:58.343 --> 17:59.942
All in mourning
and nobody dead.

17:59.944 --> 18:02.010
Our Savior wore
only simple cloth,

18:02.012 --> 18:03.712
and he was divine.

18:03.714 --> 18:07.952
As are you, Susanna,
in any cloth.

18:09.354 --> 18:11.155
Mr. Smith,

18:12.123 --> 18:14.891
I am a married woman.

18:14.893 --> 18:17.126
Unhappily.

18:17.128 --> 18:19.595
That is not...

18:19.597 --> 18:21.265
I should tell my husband.

18:23.201 --> 18:24.803
Will you?

18:30.709 --> 18:32.577
He knows.

18:38.549 --> 18:40.219
Susanna.

19:01.405 --> 19:03.905
Our neighbor's dog
has taken a great interest

19:03.907 --> 19:05.543
in my gardening.

19:16.922 --> 19:19.488
John Hall has asked for my help
to remove the vicar.

19:19.490 --> 19:21.923
I thought
he knew me better.

19:21.925 --> 19:23.359
Well, he thinks
you like him.

19:23.361 --> 19:24.963
I'm a good actor.

19:26.431 --> 19:29.498
And I try to like him
for Susanna's sake,

19:29.500 --> 19:30.732
but John is...

19:30.734 --> 19:33.603
An hypocritical shit?

19:33.605 --> 19:35.403
A Puritan.

19:36.406 --> 19:38.975
That's funny,
isn't it?

19:38.977 --> 19:43.412
A Puritan who wants
to close all the theaters

19:43.414 --> 19:47.017
will get all of
William Shakespeare's estate?

19:48.353 --> 19:50.085
Well, don't you think
that's funny?

19:51.122 --> 19:53.125
I think that's funny.

20:14.246 --> 20:16.245
<i>For what it's worth, Judith,</i>

20:16.247 --> 20:18.914
I have no intention of leaving
my estate to John Hall.

20:18.916 --> 20:21.250
No. No, you'll leave it
to the sainted Susanna,

20:21.252 --> 20:23.986
and by law,
her property is his,

20:23.988 --> 20:25.421
as is her body,

20:25.423 --> 20:27.459
for all the use
he makes of it.

20:45.977 --> 20:48.143
<i>Oh, you are grown hard, Judith.</i>

20:48.145 --> 20:51.014
There was a time when you were
such a simple, joyful soul.

20:51.016 --> 20:53.415
Heh, was I, Father?
And when was that?

20:53.417 --> 20:56.486
Was that before Hamnet died?
Is that it?

20:56.488 --> 20:58.520
Is it before Hamnet died
and I survived?

20:58.522 --> 21:00.288
- Judith.
- Well, it's what he thinks.

21:00.290 --> 21:02.892
Every single time he reads
one of them bloody poems,

21:02.894 --> 21:04.427
which aren't even
that good,

21:04.429 --> 21:07.363
he thinks, "Why did
she survive and not him?"

21:07.365 --> 21:09.198
You know,
"The golden boy's gone,

21:09.200 --> 21:10.199
and you know what?

21:10.201 --> 21:11.801
I'm just left with a girl.

21:11.803 --> 21:13.936
A useless, pointless girl.

21:13.938 --> 21:16.072
Oh, she was a pretty thing
once, that girl.

21:16.074 --> 21:18.074
She was a simple,
joyful soul, that girl,

21:18.076 --> 21:20.742
but you want to look at her
now, she's an angry bitch,

21:20.744 --> 21:22.077
still hanging around.

21:22.079 --> 21:24.982
Why did the wrong twin die?"

21:32.057 --> 21:34.726
Well, thank you
for our supper, Anne.

21:48.739 --> 21:52.642
I never said an unkind word.
I never gave her cause.

21:52.644 --> 21:55.577
You spent so long putting words
into other people's mouths,

21:55.579 --> 21:58.416
you think it only matters
what is said.

22:39.089 --> 22:40.826
Sir Thomas, I...

23:02.279 --> 23:05.581
The Puritans protest
against the old ways.

23:05.583 --> 23:09.317
Some of you resent this,
I know,

23:09.319 --> 23:13.421
but I charge you,
remember Corinthians.

23:13.423 --> 23:18.227
These good Christians act
from an honest faith.

23:18.229 --> 23:20.763
They are upright citizens.

23:20.765 --> 23:23.498
They are decent, pious...

23:23.500 --> 23:24.734
Are they, Mr. Woolmer?

23:24.736 --> 23:28.036
Are they?
Or are they fornicators?

23:29.740 --> 23:33.843
I have seen Susanna Hall creep
from her husband's house

23:33.845 --> 23:35.844
to Rafe Smith's chamber
in the night.

23:35.846 --> 23:37.514
This slander
will be answered!

23:37.516 --> 23:39.148
This slander will be proved!

23:39.150 --> 23:43.651
You'll no more tell us
how to save our souls, Dr. Hall.

23:43.653 --> 23:48.923
Not while your Puritan wives
fornicate worse than whores!

23:48.925 --> 23:50.892
I've instructed my lawyers.

23:50.894 --> 23:52.261
We shall sue for slander.

23:52.263 --> 23:54.396
- A public trial?
- It's a public slander.

23:54.398 --> 23:55.832
John Lane
is a dangerous man.

23:55.834 --> 23:57.900
We can be sure
he did not stage his attack

23:57.902 --> 23:59.735
without some idea
of how to prove it.

23:59.737 --> 24:01.571
- Prove it?
- How can you ask?

24:01.573 --> 24:04.840
Because your husband
fears he can.

24:04.842 --> 24:06.007
I mean, I fear

24:06.009 --> 24:07.744
he has constructed
a convincing lie.

24:07.746 --> 24:10.078
Well, now,
what a disaster,

24:10.080 --> 24:11.913
and that it should befall
such a fine

24:11.915 --> 24:14.583
and blameless family
as ours.

24:14.585 --> 24:17.886
The Shakespeares
will not be ruined twice.

24:35.405 --> 24:37.873
Bring forth the accused.

24:37.875 --> 24:40.476
John Lane is not here,
Your Honor.

24:40.478 --> 24:43.748
- Not here?
- He has disappeared.

24:47.285 --> 24:52.220
Susanna Shakespeare
has been most foully used.

24:52.222 --> 24:55.725
In his absence, John Lane
is found guilty of slander

24:55.727 --> 24:57.794
and excommunicated!

25:07.003 --> 25:08.305
Why?

25:09.641 --> 25:12.275
Why did this man
slander our Susanna?

25:12.277 --> 25:15.143
My guess
is to damage her husband.

25:15.145 --> 25:16.812
John Hall is a Puritan,

25:16.814 --> 25:19.649
and he would make Holy Trinity
and all the town likewise.

25:19.651 --> 25:24.821
John Lane, on the other hand,
likes his cakes and ale.

25:24.823 --> 25:26.889
Then why did he not
attend court

25:26.891 --> 25:28.826
and press his case?

25:30.060 --> 25:34.896
I discussed the matter
with him.

25:34.898 --> 25:37.535
Discussed?
Discussed what?

25:39.303 --> 25:44.306
I asked him if he'd ever seen
<i>Titus Andronicus.</i>

25:44.308 --> 25:47.008
What do I know of plays?

25:47.010 --> 25:48.811
Get away from me.

25:48.813 --> 25:50.946
I'll see you
and your whore daughter

25:50.948 --> 25:52.782
in court.

25:52.784 --> 25:55.684
Well, it
concerns, amongst other things,

25:55.686 --> 25:59.322
<i>a Moorish villain
named Aaron,</i>

25:59.324 --> 26:04.860
<i>and the African who played him
was magnificent and terrifying.</i>

26:04.862 --> 26:08.530
To kill a man,
or else devise his death,

26:08.532 --> 26:11.834
To ravish a maid,
or plot the way to do it,

26:11.836 --> 26:15.103
Accuse some innocent
and forswear myself,

26:15.105 --> 26:18.373
Set deadly enmity
between two friends,

26:18.375 --> 26:21.110
Make poor men's cattle
break their necks;

26:21.112 --> 26:24.246
Set fire on barns
and haystacks in the night,

26:24.248 --> 26:27.216
And bid the owners quench them
with their tears.

26:27.218 --> 26:30.553
Oft have I digg'd up
dead men from their graves,

26:30.555 --> 26:33.623
And set them upright
at their dear friends' doors.

26:33.625 --> 26:38.861
Tut, I have done
a thousand dreadful things

26:38.863 --> 26:42.698
As willingly
as one would kill a fly,

26:42.700 --> 26:45.200
And nothing grieves me
heartily indeed

26:45.202 --> 26:48.973
But that I cannot do
ten thousand more!

26:50.442 --> 26:52.874
I have seen that man

26:52.876 --> 26:57.679
tear the heart from a fool
that wronged him,

26:57.681 --> 27:00.449
but he could be tender too,
this extraordinary man.

27:00.451 --> 27:03.686
And one day,
his wild heart was tamed,

27:03.688 --> 27:08.727
and he loved my daughter.

27:09.861 --> 27:11.794
- Susanna?
- Yes,

27:11.796 --> 27:14.229
but their love
could never be, of course.

27:14.231 --> 27:18.767
But he swore that if ever
she had need of him,

27:18.769 --> 27:23.238
then his sword, his claws
and his teeth would be hers,

27:23.240 --> 27:26.275
either to defend her
or to kill for her.

27:26.277 --> 27:31.446
Now, should I inform him
of Susanna's current distress?

27:31.448 --> 27:33.815
Will, I saw <i>Titus.</i>

27:33.817 --> 27:36.518
Aaron was played
by the sweetest chap

27:36.520 --> 27:37.754
you'd ever hope to meet.

27:37.756 --> 27:39.321
He was a lovely fellow.

27:39.323 --> 27:41.957
John Lane doesn't know that.
I've never let the truth

27:41.959 --> 27:43.961
get in the way of a good story.

27:54.172 --> 27:56.875
Do you think
there's any truth in...

27:58.142 --> 28:00.679
In what Lane says
about Susanna?

28:03.981 --> 28:05.517
Well...

28:08.185 --> 28:12.289
there is coldness
between them.

28:13.757 --> 28:15.990
We've seen that.

28:15.992 --> 28:18.862
It's five years
since they had a child.

28:20.798 --> 28:24.400
She knows this Rafe Smith,

28:24.402 --> 28:26.969
and she did send to London
for mercury.

28:26.971 --> 28:28.738
Mercury is a cure
for the pox.

28:28.740 --> 28:29.904
Will.

28:29.906 --> 28:32.374
Susanna's not poxed.
I'd know.

28:32.376 --> 28:35.044
Well, he, then? I mean,
a poxed man is always pissing.

28:35.046 --> 28:37.345
He seems to be.

28:37.347 --> 28:39.180
Is that...?

28:39.182 --> 28:41.216
Is that why she bears
no more children?

28:41.218 --> 28:42.351
Is...?

28:42.353 --> 28:47.189
Did she seek comfort
elsewhere?

28:47.191 --> 28:49.123
Susanna's
a God-fearing woman.

28:49.125 --> 28:51.360
She would not betray
her husband.

28:51.362 --> 28:53.296
Well, maybe it isn't
a betrayal.

28:53.298 --> 28:54.662
Judith?

28:54.664 --> 28:57.734
Well, maybe he told her
to do it.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.302
Well, it's a thought,
isn't it?

29:00.304 --> 29:03.471
And frankly, Father,
if you got a grandson by it,

29:03.473 --> 29:06.040
would you care
if it were true?

29:08.313 --> 29:10.746
I care that Susanna is free
from slander.

29:10.748 --> 29:12.417
That, you may be sure,
is true.

29:13.750 --> 29:15.920
Nothing is ever true.

29:52.256 --> 29:54.222
I wrote you another poem
today.

29:54.224 --> 29:56.093
Would you like to hear it?

29:58.195 --> 29:59.830
Hamnet?

30:04.101 --> 30:05.470
Will?

30:17.381 --> 30:18.950
Anne?

30:22.019 --> 30:23.288
He was here.

30:26.490 --> 30:29.126
He'll always be here, Will.

30:55.685 --> 30:57.120
Hmm.

30:58.422 --> 31:00.622
Hmm.

31:00.624 --> 31:04.959
You know, in London now,
the plays have just finished.

31:04.961 --> 31:07.296
- Taverns will be full.
- If you're missing London,

31:07.298 --> 31:09.698
- why don't you go back there?
- Do you wish I would?

31:09.700 --> 31:11.999
Doesn't matter what I wish,
but what you wish,

31:12.001 --> 31:14.202
- and it isn't to be with us.
- What do you mean?

31:14.204 --> 31:16.505
Heh. You've come back
to mourn Hamnet,

31:16.507 --> 31:18.507
to mourn your blessed,
departed son,

31:18.509 --> 31:20.508
- and dig a bloody garden for him.
- Judith.

31:20.510 --> 31:22.477
- Enough.
- No, we've mourned him, Father.

31:22.479 --> 31:25.514
We mourned him when he died,
and we mourned him thereafter,

31:25.516 --> 31:28.249
but now, now it seems like
we've just got to begin again

31:28.251 --> 31:30.751
as if his grave was freshly
dug, because suddenly,

31:30.753 --> 31:32.988
suddenly you found the time
to mourn him too.

31:32.990 --> 31:34.689
Will you hold your tongue?

31:34.691 --> 31:38.059
If you can't respect me,
respect yourself at least.

31:38.061 --> 31:39.827
If you're done
with mourning him,

31:39.829 --> 31:42.831
- then try and honor his memory.
- How can you say that I don't?

31:42.833 --> 31:45.267
Start living up to it.
You can't match his talent,

31:45.269 --> 31:47.268
then match his goodness
and his diligence

31:47.270 --> 31:49.240
because you're wasting
your life!

31:52.410 --> 31:56.010
I know what you think's
the purpose of a woman's life.

31:56.012 --> 31:59.182
I know what you want
from me.

32:38.121 --> 32:40.788
Mr. Shakespeare?

32:40.790 --> 32:42.490
- I don't want to pester you.
- Good.

32:42.492 --> 32:44.759
Excellent news. Cheerio.

32:44.761 --> 32:46.895
I just wanted to ask you...

32:46.897 --> 32:49.096
The best way
to get started as a writer

32:49.098 --> 32:50.867
is to start writing.

32:51.999 --> 32:52.968
- Could I...?
- I don't have a favorite play.

32:52.970 --> 32:54.836
I admire my fellow dramatists
equally.

32:54.838 --> 32:57.805
I think women should be allowed
to perform the female roles,

32:57.807 --> 32:59.574
as is the practice
on the continent.

32:59.576 --> 33:03.545
- If you'll excuse me.
- I wanted to ask how you knew.

33:03.547 --> 33:06.183
- Knew what?
- Everything.

33:11.087 --> 33:14.489
I don't even know how to keep
the slugs out of the hollyhocks.

33:14.491 --> 33:17.092
There is no corner
of this world

33:17.094 --> 33:20.828
you have not explored,
no geography of the soul

33:20.830 --> 33:23.166
which you cannot navigate.

33:24.300 --> 33:25.202
How?

33:26.936 --> 33:28.740
How do you know?

33:29.772 --> 33:32.673
Just what I know?

33:32.675 --> 33:36.111
If I know,
and I don't say that I do,

33:36.113 --> 33:37.849
I...

33:38.648 --> 33:40.050
have imagined.

33:41.551 --> 33:44.151
But they say
that you left school at 14.

33:44.153 --> 33:45.720
You've never traveled.

33:45.722 --> 33:47.021
Imagined from what?

33:47.023 --> 33:49.725
- From myself.
- Yourself?

33:49.727 --> 33:51.392
Yes.

33:51.394 --> 33:54.028
Everything I've ever done,
everything I've ever seen,

33:54.030 --> 33:55.530
every book I've ever read,

33:55.532 --> 33:58.199
every conversation
I've ever had, including...

33:58.201 --> 33:59.636
God help me.
...this one.

34:04.473 --> 34:07.008
If you want to be a writer,

34:07.010 --> 34:10.179
then speak to others
and for others.

34:10.181 --> 34:13.349
Speak first for yourself.

34:13.351 --> 34:16.318
Search within.

34:16.320 --> 34:19.922
Consider the contents
of your own soul,

34:20.992 --> 34:22.356
your humanity.

34:22.358 --> 34:25.226
And if you're honest
with yourself,

34:25.228 --> 34:27.563
then whatever you write,

34:27.565 --> 34:31.735
all is true.

34:33.170 --> 34:37.072
Now, if you can't save
my hollyhocks,

34:37.074 --> 34:38.943
please leave me
to mourn the dead.

34:41.677 --> 34:43.447
Then why?

34:46.282 --> 34:48.418
Why did you stop writing?

34:53.757 --> 34:55.293
Cheerio.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.096
Cheerio.

35:10.507 --> 35:13.008
Morning, Tom Quiney.
A barrel of huffcap ale

35:13.010 --> 35:15.344
and three flagons
of Malmsey wine to New Place.

35:15.346 --> 35:18.380
Now, your usual order
and my usual reply.

35:18.382 --> 35:21.550
Marry me, Judith. I would help
bring back your smile.

35:21.552 --> 35:23.550
Yeah, and every other maid
in the county,

35:23.552 --> 35:24.885
as you chase them all.

35:24.887 --> 35:26.621
Yes, but I only
ever propose to one.

35:26.623 --> 35:28.222
Heh. I'd think
you'd tire of it.

35:28.224 --> 35:29.791
I remember a girl,

35:29.793 --> 35:32.394
the prettiest
and the happiest in town.

35:32.396 --> 35:36.097
And I remember her laugh,
and I remember kiss chase.

35:36.099 --> 35:37.731
And I would like
to see the woman

35:37.733 --> 35:39.568
that girl
should have become.

35:39.570 --> 35:42.006
Because it surely isn't you.

35:52.416 --> 35:54.249
My lord!

35:54.251 --> 35:55.751
My lord.

35:55.753 --> 35:58.122
For you, sir,
from the Earl of Southampton.

36:01.958 --> 36:05.293
Anne. Anne.

36:05.295 --> 36:08.329
The Earl of Southampton
makes a progress north,

36:08.331 --> 36:11.766
and he writes to me here
that since he passes close by,

36:11.768 --> 36:14.171
he will spend an hour or two
in talk with me.

36:15.137 --> 36:16.271
Did you hear me, Anne?

36:16.273 --> 36:18.606
The Earl of Southampton.

36:18.608 --> 36:20.443
I heard you.

36:22.079 --> 36:23.778
And I recall the first day

36:23.780 --> 36:27.950
I heard about your friend,
the Earl of Southampton.

36:27.952 --> 36:31.920
The same day as a book of poems
was published.

36:31.922 --> 36:33.824
<i>Sonnets,</i> they told me.

36:35.992 --> 36:38.159
Suppose you thought
because I couldn't read,

36:38.161 --> 36:39.730
I wouldn't mind.

36:41.465 --> 36:45.870
But plenty of people can read,
even in our little town.

36:48.172 --> 36:50.171
Including one
of your own daughters.

36:50.173 --> 36:52.340
Anne, those sonnets
were published illegally

36:52.342 --> 36:54.041
without my knowledge
or my consent.

36:54.043 --> 36:56.378
But you wrote them, Will,
and people read them.

36:56.380 --> 36:57.746
And after they'd read them,

36:57.748 --> 36:59.380
they kept asking,
"Who are they?

36:59.382 --> 37:01.983
Who is this dark lady
he's so in love with?"

37:01.985 --> 37:04.219
- They were just poems.
- The handsome man?

37:04.221 --> 37:05.320
They were just poems.

37:05.322 --> 37:07.057
Don't answer.

37:08.692 --> 37:11.126
I don't want to know.
I didn't want to know then,

37:11.128 --> 37:13.364
and I don't want to know now.

37:15.331 --> 37:19.300
But I know
who some people said he was.

37:19.302 --> 37:21.838
Now it appears he's coming
to my house a-calling.

37:31.748 --> 37:37.288
All these years, Will,
worried about your reputation.

37:38.722 --> 37:41.559
Have you even once
considered mine?

38:03.646 --> 38:06.315
<i>I've heard word of
your distinguished visitor,</i>

38:06.317 --> 38:09.016
and my men tell me he's even
now approaching the town.

38:09.018 --> 38:10.851
You will, of course,
introduce me.

38:10.853 --> 38:13.755
I shall suggest he comes on
to Charlecote to take his ease.

38:13.757 --> 38:15.190
Bit more
what he's used to.

38:15.192 --> 38:17.191
Naturally, I shall ask
that you join us.

38:17.193 --> 38:18.525
Just you, I think.

38:18.527 --> 38:21.128
We shouldn't wish to tire
His Grace.

38:21.130 --> 38:22.764
And you may go in.

38:22.766 --> 38:24.835
We shall greet His Grace.

38:34.143 --> 38:36.811
Welcome to Stratford-upon-Avon,
Your Grace.

38:36.813 --> 38:37.878
And you are?

38:37.880 --> 38:40.282
Heh. Sir Thomas Lucy

38:40.284 --> 38:42.083
of Charlecote Manor,
Your Grace,

38:42.085 --> 38:44.786
and Member of Parliament
for this district.

38:44.788 --> 38:48.423
May I have the honor
of introducing my wife?

38:48.425 --> 38:51.025
- Have we business?
- Well, I...

38:51.027 --> 38:54.762
Is there some petition
which you've come to present?

38:54.764 --> 38:56.965
Oh, no, no. I thought only
to invite you...

38:56.967 --> 38:58.934
Then kindly remove yourself,
Sir Thomas.

38:58.936 --> 39:00.467
I want none of your company.

39:00.469 --> 39:03.938
I'm here to visit
the greatest man in the kingdom.

39:03.940 --> 39:05.809
After His Majesty, of course.

39:07.443 --> 39:08.876
Damn impudence.

39:08.878 --> 39:12.146
Grubby little
member of Parliament.

39:12.148 --> 39:14.516
They'll sell a knighthood
to anybody these days.

39:17.788 --> 39:20.322
He has snubbed me
so many times.

39:20.324 --> 39:22.624
Why do you let him snub you?

39:22.626 --> 39:25.293
What is he?
The son of a son.

39:25.295 --> 39:26.693
Nothing more.

39:26.695 --> 39:28.463
All his pride and strut
comes

39:28.465 --> 39:30.865
from no greater achievement
than having been spat

39:30.867 --> 39:32.833
from the dick
of a previous nonentity.

39:32.835 --> 39:34.836
- Well, I'm the same.
- No.

39:34.838 --> 39:37.039
I'm the son of a son, Will.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.441
Mm, Henry Wriothesley,
son of Henry Wriothesley.

39:39.443 --> 39:41.543
If I were not the son
of Henry Wriothesley,

39:41.545 --> 39:45.347
then your Thomas Lucy,
son of Thomas Lucy,

39:45.349 --> 39:47.883
would not grace me
with a sneer.

39:47.885 --> 39:49.650
You, on the other hand,
are...

39:49.652 --> 39:51.186
Are the son of a thief.

39:51.188 --> 39:54.389
The son of Apollo, Will.

39:54.391 --> 39:57.191
God of poetry, god of truth.

39:57.193 --> 40:02.530
The finest, the most complete

40:02.532 --> 40:04.333
and most beautiful mind,
I warrant,

40:04.335 --> 40:06.237
that ever existed
in this world.

40:07.403 --> 40:08.806
Hmm.

40:11.907 --> 40:14.041
So...

40:14.043 --> 40:16.045
why are you so small, Will?

40:17.313 --> 40:18.713
Small?

40:18.715 --> 40:21.581
Why are you
such a little man?

40:21.583 --> 40:24.151
Your Grace, I...

40:24.153 --> 40:27.054
You can enchant the multitude
with a scratch of your quill,

40:27.056 --> 40:29.490
and yet you cringe
before Sir Thomas Lucy.

40:29.492 --> 40:31.392
- Cringe?
- Your talent has a greater scope

40:31.394 --> 40:34.896
than all the other poets
combined,

40:34.898 --> 40:37.331
and yet you've lived
the smallest life.

40:37.333 --> 40:41.170
I don't feel I've lived
a small life, Your Grace.

40:41.172 --> 40:44.072
Come now, Will.
Compared to Kyd?

40:45.476 --> 40:47.474
Or Marlowe?

40:47.476 --> 40:50.045
Oh, what a man he was.

40:50.047 --> 40:51.378
What a life.

40:51.380 --> 40:53.981
Spy, adventurer,
fucked for England.

40:53.983 --> 40:58.753
Boys, girls, boys and girls.

40:58.755 --> 41:01.423
- He knew how to live.
- He is dead, of course, my lord,

41:01.425 --> 41:03.090
so, you know,
win some, lose some.

41:03.092 --> 41:05.459
Yes, they are all dead,
Will.

41:05.461 --> 41:06.728
Marlowe, Greene.

41:06.730 --> 41:08.396
Who called me upstart.

41:08.398 --> 41:09.932
Oh, upstart crow.

41:09.934 --> 41:13.467
You see, still you care,
still it rankles.

41:14.471 --> 41:17.537
Kyd, Nashe, Spenser,

41:17.539 --> 41:19.706
all dead.

41:19.708 --> 41:21.242
Booze and passion,

41:21.244 --> 41:24.114
sex and violence
killed them all.

41:24.981 --> 41:26.817
Life killed them.

41:28.251 --> 41:29.950
But you...

41:31.621 --> 41:32.753
...you survived.

41:32.755 --> 41:35.958
Yes, I survived.

41:35.960 --> 41:39.459
- In your nice house.
- Several houses.

41:39.461 --> 41:40.829
And your coat of arms.

41:40.831 --> 41:42.930
How much
did that cost you, Will?

41:42.932 --> 41:44.066
Twenty pounds.

41:44.068 --> 41:45.967
Twenty pounds.

41:45.969 --> 41:47.469
The man who wrote <i>Hamlet</i>

41:47.471 --> 41:49.470
and <i>Henry V</i> and <i>Macbeth,</i>

41:49.472 --> 41:52.742
<i>Romeo and Juliet,</i> paid £20
for the name of "gentleman."

41:53.809 --> 41:56.413
Will, why do you care?

41:58.648 --> 42:02.516
My father was once fined
for not attending church.

42:02.518 --> 42:04.050
Can you guess
why he didn't go?

42:04.052 --> 42:06.854
Priest too Protestant?

42:06.856 --> 42:08.389
Well, I've heard it rumored

42:08.391 --> 42:11.159
there is a whiff of popery
about you Shakespeares.

42:11.161 --> 42:14.394
Nothing so spiritual.
He could not attend church

42:14.396 --> 42:18.599
because he owed money
to half of the congregation.

42:25.675 --> 42:27.874
Oh, I think I should have liked
your dad.

42:27.876 --> 42:30.345
Well, yes, people did.

42:30.347 --> 42:32.349
I did.

42:35.719 --> 42:38.088
You must write again, Will.

42:39.289 --> 42:41.856
London needs you.

42:41.858 --> 42:43.827
I need you.

42:45.961 --> 42:47.364
Hmm.

42:50.099 --> 42:52.266
We have only Jonson now.

42:52.268 --> 42:54.670
Who laughs at me
because I speak no Greek

42:54.672 --> 42:56.771
and don't know
whether Bohemia has a coast.

42:56.773 --> 42:59.007
Oh, Christ,
why do you care what he thinks?

42:59.009 --> 43:01.575
- You wrote <i>King Lear.</i>
- Because it matters, Your Grace.

43:01.577 --> 43:03.177
Well, in England,
it matters.

43:03.179 --> 43:05.347
I have what I have
upon my own merit,

43:05.349 --> 43:07.449
and for that I'm suspect.

43:07.451 --> 43:10.619
Well, perhaps
I'll always be suspect,

43:10.621 --> 43:14.287
but I have my money,
and I have my houses,

43:14.289 --> 43:16.590
and I have my coat of arms.

43:16.592 --> 43:19.226
And you have your verses.

43:19.228 --> 43:22.063
Great Christ, man,
you have your poetry.

43:22.065 --> 43:23.363
Such poetry.

43:23.365 --> 43:25.235
Such beautiful...

43:27.369 --> 43:28.871
beautiful poetry.

43:35.411 --> 43:37.780
And some of it...

43:40.384 --> 43:42.684
Some of it was writ for me.

43:42.686 --> 43:44.418
Yes.

43:44.420 --> 43:45.954
Yes, Your Grace.

43:45.956 --> 43:48.088
For you.

43:49.760 --> 43:52.293
I have grown old.

43:52.295 --> 43:56.432
As you said in your sonnets
that I would, you bastard.

43:58.302 --> 44:02.840
But the beauty I inspired in you
will be forever young.

44:05.007 --> 44:06.840
And in a thousand years
from now,

44:06.842 --> 44:10.010
when people read those lines,
I will...

44:10.012 --> 44:11.848
Will be young,

44:13.583 --> 44:15.653
alive still,

44:16.987 --> 44:19.722
in the hearts of lovers
yet unborn.

44:21.657 --> 44:24.592
They were only meant for you,
Your Grace.

44:24.594 --> 44:29.766
Not for any other living soul,
nor any yet to live.

44:30.567 --> 44:31.869
Just you.

44:36.273 --> 44:38.805
It was only flattery,
of course.

44:38.807 --> 44:40.807
Flattery that was my due.

44:40.809 --> 44:43.311
Yes.

44:43.313 --> 44:45.979
Just flattery.

44:45.981 --> 44:47.617
Except...

44:48.985 --> 44:52.322
I spoke from deep
within my heart.

44:55.125 --> 44:57.527
Well, I was younger then.

45:00.028 --> 45:01.494
Younger and prettier.

45:01.496 --> 45:05.900
Beautiful, Your Grace,
as you will ever be.

45:05.902 --> 45:10.637
When in disgrace
with fortune and men's eyes

45:10.639 --> 45:13.874
I all alone beweep
my outcast state,

45:13.876 --> 45:16.577
And trouble deaf heaven
with my bootless cries,

45:16.579 --> 45:19.880
And look upon myself,
and curse my fate,

45:19.882 --> 45:22.516
Wishing me like to one more
rich in hope,

45:22.518 --> 45:25.485
Featured like him, like him
with friends possessed,

45:25.487 --> 45:27.889
Desiring this man's art,
and that man's scope,

45:27.891 --> 45:30.858
With what I most enjoy
contented least;

45:30.860 --> 45:34.695
Yet in these thoughts
My self almost despising,

45:34.697 --> 45:40.700
Haply I think on thee,
and then my state,

45:40.702 --> 45:44.905
Like to the lark
at break of day arising

45:44.907 --> 45:51.012
From sullen earth,
sings hymns at heaven's gate;

45:51.014 --> 45:57.952
For thy sweet love remembered
such wealth brings

45:57.954 --> 46:04.427
That then I scorn to change
my state with kings.

46:11.068 --> 46:15.635
Yes, well, as I said,
just flattery.

46:15.637 --> 46:17.807
Not flattery. Truth.

46:18.907 --> 46:21.077
And I always dared to hope.

46:21.811 --> 46:23.313
Hope?

46:26.583 --> 46:30.918
- Will?
- That perhaps in some small way

46:30.920 --> 46:35.222
- it was reciprocated.
- Reciprocated?

46:35.224 --> 46:38.626
- That perhaps you also...
- You forget yourself, Will.

46:38.628 --> 46:40.297
I...

46:41.898 --> 46:44.032
As a poet,
you have no equal,

46:44.034 --> 46:47.101
and I, like anyone
with brain or heart,

46:47.103 --> 46:48.672
am your humble servant.

46:50.806 --> 46:52.072
But as a man, Will,

46:52.074 --> 46:54.644
it is not your place
to love me,

46:56.079 --> 46:59.780
and hanging a £20 shield
above your door

46:59.782 --> 47:02.318
will never make it so.

47:13.329 --> 47:15.364
Well, I must be off.

47:16.532 --> 47:17.900
Farewell.

47:19.369 --> 47:21.603
It was the poet
that I came to visit,

47:21.605 --> 47:24.740
and it is of the poet
that I take my leave.

47:32.148 --> 47:37.084
When in disgrace
with fortune and men's eyes

47:37.086 --> 47:41.356
I all alone beweep
my outcast state,

47:41.358 --> 47:45.191
And trouble deaf heaven
with my bootless cries,

47:45.193 --> 47:48.795
And look upon myself,
and curse my fate,

47:48.797 --> 47:52.833
Wishing me like to one more
rich in hope,

47:52.835 --> 47:56.302
Featured like him, like him
with friends possessed,

47:56.304 --> 48:02.545
Desiring this man's art,
and that man's scope,

48:04.014 --> 48:07.084
With what I most enjoy
contented least;

48:08.851 --> 48:11.651
Yet in these thoughts
my self almost despising,

48:11.653 --> 48:16.824
Haply I think on thee,
and then my state,

48:16.826 --> 48:19.726
Like to the lark
at break of day arising

48:19.728 --> 48:24.865
From sullen earth,
sings hymns at heaven's gate;

48:24.867 --> 48:29.771
For thy sweet love remembered
such wealth brings

48:29.773 --> 48:35.245
That then I scorn to change
my state with kings.

48:48.090 --> 48:50.192
William Shakespeare.

50:31.293 --> 50:33.126
I noticed that
your friend, the Earl,

50:33.128 --> 50:36.195
didn't bring his wife
with him on his travels.

50:36.197 --> 50:39.635
Perhaps he doesn't find
female company to his taste.

50:44.606 --> 50:46.974
I'm sure His Grace
and the Countess Elizabeth

50:46.976 --> 50:49.844
are most happy
in their marriage,

50:49.846 --> 50:53.046
as I would wish you to be,
Judith.

50:53.048 --> 50:54.648
Why are you still unwed?

50:54.650 --> 50:56.550
You are so pretty, I think.

50:56.552 --> 50:58.452
- I don't.
- Well, look in your glass.

50:58.454 --> 51:01.354
I don't have a glass. I didn't
like the person I saw in it.

51:01.356 --> 51:04.492
Good God,
daughter, that's a bleak thought

51:04.494 --> 51:06.661
since the only company you keep
is your own.

51:06.663 --> 51:09.164
- Yeah, but there it is.
- And what of children?

51:09.166 --> 51:11.398
- All women want children.
- Apparently.

51:11.400 --> 51:13.601
Well, don't you want
a child?

51:13.603 --> 51:16.037
Do you want me to replace
Hamnet for you, Father?

51:16.039 --> 51:17.271
I meant just as a...

51:17.273 --> 51:19.005
For your own sake.

51:19.007 --> 51:22.742
A husband, children
for companionship, comfort.

51:22.744 --> 51:25.780
Perhaps she sees that marriage
may not bring you either.

51:25.782 --> 51:28.048
Oh. Oh, is that it, Judith?
Is that it?

51:28.050 --> 51:29.682
You've seen
your mother's misery,

51:29.684 --> 51:31.418
and you thought,
"I'll be a spinster

51:31.420 --> 51:34.088
rather than get shackled
to some man who neglects me."

51:34.090 --> 51:36.190
- I did not say I was miserable.
- You didn't,

51:36.192 --> 51:38.659
but though I put words
into other people's mouths,

51:38.661 --> 51:41.394
I, too, can occasionally see
beyond what is merely said,

51:41.396 --> 51:42.929
and I'll have
no more of this.

51:42.931 --> 51:45.365
I've worked ceaselessly
on behalf of this family.

51:45.367 --> 51:46.666
On your own
behalf.

51:46.668 --> 51:48.369
Yeah, and I'm head
of this family!

51:48.371 --> 51:51.039
And I've given you
a fine house and servants,

51:51.041 --> 51:52.440
sent you money
all your life.

51:52.442 --> 51:54.441
Is not that comfort?

51:54.443 --> 51:56.077
You have two
beautiful daughters,

51:56.079 --> 51:58.045
you've got a brilliant son
and a husband

51:58.047 --> 52:00.615
who, though absent, kept you
always in his thoughts.

52:00.617 --> 52:04.217
Is that not that companionship
in abundance?

52:05.755 --> 52:09.757
I've risen this family up!
Through my genius,

52:09.759 --> 52:11.925
I've brought fame and fortune
to this house.

52:11.927 --> 52:14.961
Yes, yes, my genius. Would you
have me ignore that, as well?

52:14.963 --> 52:16.563
Ignore a gift
from God Almighty

52:16.565 --> 52:18.432
so that I could stay here
in Stratford

52:18.434 --> 52:19.900
and be
a bloody glove maker,

52:19.902 --> 52:23.737
and you might feel
a bit more appreciated?

52:23.739 --> 52:27.075
Hamnet died, and I wasn't here!
I know that!

52:27.077 --> 52:28.909
Hamnet died,
and the plague took him,

52:28.911 --> 52:30.476
but the plague's
taken millions.

52:30.478 --> 52:32.746
It'd have taken him
whether I was in Stratford

52:32.748 --> 52:35.483
or London or on that
godforsaken highway.

52:35.485 --> 52:39.787
We just... We lost our boy!
I know that!

52:39.789 --> 52:42.722
And I wasn't here!

52:42.724 --> 52:45.425
How many times can I say it?
I wasn't here!

52:45.427 --> 52:48.628
We lost our brilliant,
brilliant boy, and I wasn't...

52:48.630 --> 52:51.999
But Hamnet
wasn't brilliant!

52:52.001 --> 52:56.403
- What do you...?
- Judith, don't.

52:56.405 --> 52:57.771
What do you mean?

52:57.773 --> 53:02.744
He was beautiful,
but he wasn't brilliant.

53:02.746 --> 53:05.148
Judith,
I said don't.

53:07.349 --> 53:08.682
I wrote them.

53:08.684 --> 53:10.887
Wrote?
Wrote what?

53:12.088 --> 53:14.157
The poems.

53:15.824 --> 53:19.293
These verses
that you hold so dear,

53:19.295 --> 53:22.829
with wit and mischief
in every line.

53:22.831 --> 53:24.498
I made them up.

53:24.500 --> 53:27.135
Hamnet only wrote them down.

53:27.137 --> 53:29.804
She helped him a little.
That's all.

53:29.806 --> 53:31.171
No, I made them up.

53:31.173 --> 53:32.706
- All of them.
- No.

53:32.708 --> 53:34.976
Hamnet was sweet and kind,
but he was no good.

53:34.978 --> 53:36.344
- No, no, no. He...
- He wasn't.

53:36.346 --> 53:39.246
No, he was
absolutely brilliant!

53:39.248 --> 53:41.849
No, Will.

53:41.851 --> 53:44.552
He was an ordinary
little boy.

53:44.554 --> 53:46.019
- What?
- If you'd looked closer,

53:46.021 --> 53:47.220
- then you'd see...
- I look...

53:47.222 --> 53:48.555
If I looked at
my own son?

53:48.557 --> 53:50.324
- If you looked...
- I looked at my son!

53:50.326 --> 53:52.726
You saw what you wanted
to see. You saw yourself.

53:52.728 --> 53:54.228
What of myself?

53:54.230 --> 53:56.296
You saw a boy with a mind

53:56.298 --> 53:58.999
who was as big
and as bold as yours.

53:59.001 --> 54:01.001
But happy, you know,
with a... With a father

54:01.003 --> 54:02.903
who appreciated
his genius.

54:02.905 --> 54:04.671
Hamnet might not
have been a genius,

54:04.673 --> 54:07.374
but he was clever enough
to know he could never live up

54:07.376 --> 54:10.614
to what you wanted him to be.
He dreaded your visits.

54:15.552 --> 54:18.153
We didn't plan it,
not at the beginning.

54:20.123 --> 54:22.789
Judith was always
making up stories

54:22.791 --> 54:25.729
and conjuring rhymes.

54:26.896 --> 54:30.298
Hamnet heard one and...

54:30.300 --> 54:33.233
And wrote it down
one day for...

54:33.235 --> 54:34.934
For practice with his pen.

54:34.936 --> 54:38.607
You found it and thought
it was his and praised him.

54:41.643 --> 54:44.013
So are they worthless now?

54:57.293 --> 54:59.760
They're not his.

54:59.762 --> 55:01.862
Will you read them no more?

55:01.864 --> 55:05.434
You sit in the sun
and chuckle at their wit.

55:06.869 --> 55:08.637
Well, they aren't his.

55:09.806 --> 55:11.441
No.

55:13.376 --> 55:14.811
They're mine.

55:23.619 --> 55:24.786
And so I will do

55:24.788 --> 55:27.990
what I bloody well please
with them.

55:35.831 --> 55:39.766
No! No, no, no!

55:39.768 --> 55:43.871
No, no, no,
you can't have them.

56:51.673 --> 56:55.476
Judith tried to teach herself
to write,

56:55.478 --> 56:59.282
you know,
after Hamnet's death.

57:00.817 --> 57:03.050
But she never had
the patience.

57:03.052 --> 57:05.255
Not like Susanna.

57:09.090 --> 57:11.358
I should have liked
to have been able to write

57:11.360 --> 57:17.066
a few letters of the alphabet,
particularly married to you.

57:20.036 --> 57:22.903
Remember our wedding day?

57:22.905 --> 57:26.342
Me, older, pregnant,

57:27.775 --> 57:31.413
and you a strange,
clever lad of 18.

57:33.248 --> 57:35.651
I know what people thought.

57:37.619 --> 57:39.586
I couldn't even sign
the register.

57:39.588 --> 57:41.954
Just made a stupid mark.

57:41.956 --> 57:44.293
I felt so foolish.

57:47.163 --> 57:51.565
Then you went to London
and became this great writer,

57:51.567 --> 57:56.940
with a wife at home
who couldn't read a word.

58:05.614 --> 58:09.085
I often wondered
if it bothered you.

58:11.119 --> 58:13.088
But why should it?

58:14.422 --> 58:16.625
You were hardly here.

58:35.543 --> 58:37.413
I'm sorry.

58:40.516 --> 58:42.382
You lost your son.

58:42.384 --> 58:45.184
Any man would mourn.

58:45.186 --> 58:47.454
A daughter is nothing.

58:47.456 --> 58:50.824
They're destined only to become
the property of another man.

58:50.826 --> 58:51.825
We fade away.

58:51.827 --> 58:54.795
No, Judith.

58:54.797 --> 58:57.998
You mustn't fade away.
Why don't you write again?

58:58.000 --> 58:59.666
Father, you know
I cannot write.

58:59.668 --> 59:02.137
I could teach you.

59:04.539 --> 59:06.273
I have no verse
left in me anymore.

59:06.275 --> 59:08.775
- Why?
- Because the wrong twin died.

59:08.777 --> 59:11.644
No, it was the plague.
The plague makes no judgments.

59:11.646 --> 59:13.447
It's just a plague.

59:13.449 --> 59:15.148
Well, I wish
a plague had taken me.

59:15.150 --> 59:17.485
Judith, why do you
hate yourself?

59:17.487 --> 59:20.787
I have stolen Hamnet
from you twice,

59:20.789 --> 59:23.490
once by surviving him,

59:23.492 --> 59:25.860
and now by taking
your dream of him away.

59:25.862 --> 59:28.496
You've given me
a new dream.

59:28.498 --> 59:30.731
My beautiful daughter,
the poet.

59:30.733 --> 59:34.068
A woman cannot be a poet.

59:34.070 --> 59:37.472
A woman is put upon this Earth
for one reason.

59:38.340 --> 59:40.643
I know my duty now.

59:42.244 --> 59:45.481
I will make amends
for stealing Hamnet from you.

59:46.882 --> 59:50.385
I prom... I promise
I will make amends.

01:00:15.577 --> 01:00:18.412
I'm glad Hamnet
didn't write the poems.

01:00:18.414 --> 01:00:21.514
- Glad?
- I know him better now.

01:00:21.516 --> 01:00:23.117
And it's love, not ambition,

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:24.751
that will blossom
in this garden.

01:00:24.753 --> 01:00:28.287
Well, something has to.
Not much else has blossomed.

01:00:28.289 --> 01:00:31.494
I'm not a good gardener,
it's true.

01:00:32.994 --> 01:00:36.429
Found it easier
to create things with words.

01:00:36.431 --> 01:00:38.500
Well,
you'll find that.

01:00:40.668 --> 01:00:42.605
Would you like me
to help?

01:00:50.346 --> 01:00:53.514
And here.
I think further.

01:00:53.516 --> 01:00:55.718
- Over here?
- Yes.

01:01:00.956 --> 01:01:02.759
That one.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.925
Make a really big hole.

01:01:05.927 --> 01:01:07.760
Ah. Oh, brilliant.

01:01:07.762 --> 01:01:08.961
So maybe we can put...

01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:43.565
Good night, Anne.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.436
Stay with me, Will.

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:51.572
For comfort.

01:01:51.574 --> 01:01:54.177
In our second-best bed.

01:02:10.891 --> 01:02:12.293
I will take that glass

01:02:12.295 --> 01:02:14.396
of Rhenish wine with you,
Tom Quiney.

01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:26.639
You know that I am not
a good man.

01:02:26.641 --> 01:02:28.807
There have been
women.

01:02:28.809 --> 01:02:30.309
Many women.

01:02:30.311 --> 01:02:32.746
Look, I've seen
too little of life.

01:02:32.748 --> 01:02:34.882
You've seen
too much.

01:02:34.884 --> 01:02:38.751
But perhaps together
we may begin again.

01:02:46.094 --> 01:02:47.795
She was not ordering wine.

01:02:47.797 --> 01:02:49.963
She was drinking it
with Quiney.

01:02:49.965 --> 01:02:52.731
She was inside
for half an hour or more.

01:02:52.733 --> 01:02:55.034
If Judith is reaching
for a little happiness,

01:02:55.036 --> 01:02:56.637
then I'm glad of it.

01:02:56.639 --> 01:02:59.539
Sinning will not
make her happy.

01:02:59.541 --> 01:03:01.541
Really?

01:03:01.543 --> 01:03:04.043
Then let us hope
it makes her unhappiness

01:03:04.045 --> 01:03:06.380
a little more bearable.

01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:09.081
That is a wicked thing to say.
Remember your scripture.

01:03:09.083 --> 01:03:11.550
What I remember is a little girl
who smiled a lot.

01:03:11.552 --> 01:03:13.853
A reputation once lost
cannot be refound.

01:03:13.855 --> 01:03:17.724
- Mine was!
- Yours was not lost!

01:03:17.726 --> 01:03:21.260
It was defamed
by a convicted drunkard

01:03:21.262 --> 01:03:23.362
and suspected Papist.

01:03:23.364 --> 01:03:25.532
Judith must drop
this Quiney.

01:03:25.534 --> 01:03:27.403
He's debauched.

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:31.371
If only those without sin
were allowed to marry,

01:03:31.373 --> 01:03:34.342
there would be
precious few weddings.

01:04:14.416 --> 01:04:16.483
I can't see you
anymore, Margaret.

01:04:16.485 --> 01:04:18.083
- Oh.
- I'm sorry.

01:04:18.085 --> 01:04:20.019
Because of
Judith Shakespeare.

01:04:20.021 --> 01:04:22.988
I never made you a promise,
Margaret. You know that.

01:04:22.990 --> 01:04:24.657
If we sinned,
we sinned together.

01:04:24.659 --> 01:04:26.661
She's
with child.

01:04:28.030 --> 01:04:30.164
- Can you be sure it's mine?
- You dare ask it?

01:04:30.166 --> 01:04:32.132
Margaret has many friends
at the tavern.

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:34.300
- Dare again.
- I'm certain. I...

01:04:34.302 --> 01:04:35.971
I think...

01:04:37.271 --> 01:04:40.139
I believe
it's yours, Tom.

01:04:40.141 --> 01:04:42.277
Honestly,
I do.

01:04:46.882 --> 01:04:50.016
Francis
Collins, come in, come in.

01:04:50.018 --> 01:04:51.483
- You'll take some wine?
- Please.

01:04:51.485 --> 01:04:54.688
Maria, some wine, if you please.

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:56.655
I'm relieved to see you
in high spirits.

01:04:56.657 --> 01:04:58.258
When a man sends
for his lawyer,

01:04:58.260 --> 01:04:59.391
it is not always so.

01:04:59.393 --> 01:05:02.429
- Judith is getting married.
- No.

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:04.697
Congratulations.

01:05:04.699 --> 01:05:06.398
It was a crime
that such a spirited

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:09.068
- young woman remained unwed.
- Well, crime no longer.

01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:11.572
And so I would like
to amend my will

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:15.008
to include my new son-in-law,
Tom Quiney.

01:05:15.010 --> 01:05:16.642
Quiney, is it?

01:05:16.644 --> 01:05:19.345
- Wine and tobacco. Good trade.
- Can't think of a better.

01:05:19.347 --> 01:05:21.581
And thus,
we must also make provision

01:05:21.583 --> 01:05:25.086
for their male issue,
my...

01:05:27.255 --> 01:05:28.387
grandsons.

01:05:28.389 --> 01:05:30.759
Many of them.

01:05:32.594 --> 01:05:36.396
I should also like
to leave something to Anne.

01:05:36.398 --> 01:05:39.566
Anne? Oh, if she survives you,
she will have a third by law.

01:05:39.568 --> 01:05:41.901
She'll survive me,
there's no doubt about that.

01:05:41.903 --> 01:05:43.637
She's years older,
10 times tougher.

01:05:43.639 --> 01:05:46.805
I don't mean money. She'll have
more of that than she can spend.

01:05:46.807 --> 01:05:51.144
No, I had in mind
a piece of furniture.

01:05:51.146 --> 01:05:53.813
Furniture?

01:05:53.815 --> 01:05:55.548
But surely
Anne will live here

01:05:55.550 --> 01:05:57.450
and have the use
of every stick.

01:05:57.452 --> 01:06:00.753
A specific piece
of furniture which,

01:06:00.755 --> 01:06:04.456
when it is no longer ours,
must be hers,

01:06:04.458 --> 01:06:08.530
and when she is in it,
I hope she will...

01:06:09.563 --> 01:06:14.469
smile and think of me.

01:06:16.637 --> 01:06:19.606
So...

01:06:46.934 --> 01:06:49.269
So one
son-in-law owns a wine shop,

01:06:49.271 --> 01:06:51.003
and the other one
wants to close it.

01:06:52.206 --> 01:06:53.472
Welcome to my family.

01:06:53.474 --> 01:06:56.175
I know that sometimes we...

01:06:56.177 --> 01:06:58.644
we Shakespeares have been
our own worst enemies,

01:06:58.646 --> 01:07:05.284
and sometimes we have had,
the worst of enemies.

01:07:05.286 --> 01:07:07.954
If ever John Lane shows
his face round here again,

01:07:07.956 --> 01:07:09.356
he'll have his nose cut off!

01:07:09.358 --> 01:07:10.990
Yes, we've had
our ups and downs,

01:07:10.992 --> 01:07:14.693
but I flatter myself that...

01:07:14.695 --> 01:07:19.798
That I have brought some
small credit to my hometown.

01:07:27.509 --> 01:07:29.844
And although
I no longer ha...

01:07:40.621 --> 01:07:42.824
Although I no longer have
a son...

01:07:44.193 --> 01:07:45.825
And show me a family
in this town

01:07:45.827 --> 01:07:48.862
that has not lost at least
one child.

01:07:48.864 --> 01:07:53.869
...I have
two beautiful daughters.

01:07:55.369 --> 01:07:59.808
And so, perhaps one day,
I shall have a grandson.

01:08:01.177 --> 01:08:03.409
And for that, of course,
I, in fact,

01:08:03.411 --> 01:08:05.677
look to you, Tom,
and also to you, John,

01:08:05.679 --> 01:08:07.613
so please, ahem,
be about your business.

01:08:08.784 --> 01:08:10.920
Ahem. Thank you very much.
Um...

01:08:13.188 --> 01:08:17.024
For family is everything,

01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:19.728
and today...

01:08:22.764 --> 01:08:25.732
I could not be more proud
of mine.

01:08:48.221 --> 01:08:51.827
I saw Margaret Wheeler
in the church today, Tom.

01:08:56.497 --> 01:08:58.600
I know it, Judith.

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:04.439
And I cannot undo
what is done.

01:09:06.274 --> 01:09:08.711
I have confessed all
to you.

01:09:15.015 --> 01:09:17.616
All I can promise you
is that her and her child

01:09:17.618 --> 01:09:19.587
will want for nothing.

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:54.687
We'll find him.

01:09:54.689 --> 01:09:56.156
Where is he?

01:09:56.158 --> 01:09:57.790
Is he over there?

01:09:57.792 --> 01:09:59.761
- He's over there.
- Everything all right?

01:10:01.296 --> 01:10:03.528
Anne,
is everything all right?

01:10:03.530 --> 01:10:06.165
Yes, fine.

01:10:06.167 --> 01:10:07.937
Then why the...?

01:10:09.537 --> 01:10:11.239
Well, you see...

01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:15.877
Father, we have some news.

01:10:17.212 --> 01:10:20.345
- And that news is...
- Yes?

01:10:20.347 --> 01:10:21.380
that I'm pregnant.

01:10:25.953 --> 01:10:28.388
Oh, no, my dear!

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:29.990
Oh, yes!

01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:32.325
Mr. Quiney!

01:10:32.327 --> 01:10:33.326
Oh.

01:10:35.329 --> 01:10:36.829
Well done,
my boy.

01:10:36.831 --> 01:10:38.298
My darling.

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:41.233
Sister, I'm truly happy
for you.

01:10:41.235 --> 01:10:43.503
Oh, this is so wonderful.

01:10:43.505 --> 01:10:45.338
But where is John?

01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:46.673
John should be here.

01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:49.075
He was called out
to a confinement.

01:10:49.077 --> 01:10:50.878
Quiney!

01:10:56.685 --> 01:11:01.588
Margaret Wheeler
has died in childbirth,

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:03.792
along with her baby.

01:11:05.694 --> 01:11:08.097
The child has no name.

01:11:09.465 --> 01:11:12.464
It will not enter heaven
without one.

01:11:50.072 --> 01:11:53.138
Well, well, Mr. Shakespeare.

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:54.773
How very unfortunate.

01:11:54.775 --> 01:11:59.178
Seems your daughter's wedding
was rushed for a reason.

01:11:59.180 --> 01:12:00.345
Like your own, eh?

01:12:01.684 --> 01:12:06.352
The apple doesn't fall far
from the tree.

01:12:06.354 --> 01:12:09.955
Damn me, you Shakespeares
are a scandalous lot.

01:12:09.957 --> 01:12:12.157
Perhaps being
an illiterate farm girl,

01:12:12.159 --> 01:12:17.863
your wife was unable
to teach your girls morals.

01:12:17.865 --> 01:12:20.599
Well, well.
Must be getting on.

01:12:20.601 --> 01:12:22.634
Can't loll about all day

01:12:22.636 --> 01:12:25.138
thinking pretty thoughts,
like you poets.

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:26.438
I must to business.

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:27.807
Business, Sir Thomas?

01:12:27.809 --> 01:12:29.075
Yes, business.

01:12:29.077 --> 01:12:30.777
A large estate
like Charlecote

01:12:30.779 --> 01:12:32.178
doesn't run itself,
you know.

01:12:32.180 --> 01:12:33.845
I thought you meant
real business.

01:12:33.847 --> 01:12:35.415
Like building, owning
and operating

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:37.317
London's largest theater,
for instance.

01:12:37.319 --> 01:12:39.619
Actors, carpenters,
seamstresses, crew to pay,

01:12:39.621 --> 01:12:42.187
bribes to pay,
security to mount,

01:12:42.189 --> 01:12:44.590
politics to navigate,
3000 paying customers

01:12:44.592 --> 01:12:46.159
to be fed and watered
every afternoon,

01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:48.527
each promised a spectacle
greater than the last.

01:12:48.529 --> 01:12:51.129
One hundred and seventy
Royal Command Performances

01:12:51.131 --> 01:12:52.699
for our queen and our king.

01:12:52.701 --> 01:12:53.967
Have you considered
the logistics

01:12:53.969 --> 01:12:55.300
of mounting
the Battle of Shrewsbury

01:12:55.302 --> 01:12:56.669
in the banqueting hall
at Hampton Court?

01:12:56.671 --> 01:12:58.671
Please don't.
It would make you so tired.

01:12:58.673 --> 01:13:01.540
And yet, in all the years
that I have run my vast, complex

01:13:01.542 --> 01:13:03.809
and spectacularly successful
business, Thomas,

01:13:03.811 --> 01:13:07.479
I have indeed found the time
to think and to write down

01:13:07.481 --> 01:13:10.415
the pretty thoughts you mention
and which, in my experience,

01:13:10.417 --> 01:13:13.719
bring immense pleasure to those
who seek mere diversion

01:13:13.721 --> 01:13:16.723
or respite
from this veil of tears,

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:21.894
without which, it would all be
about as pointless as...

01:13:21.896 --> 01:13:24.062
Well, about as pointless
as you, Sir Thomas.

01:13:24.064 --> 01:13:27.066
And, since you mention her,
my wife, Anne,

01:13:27.068 --> 01:13:30.969
has more decency and wisdom
in her daily shit

01:13:30.971 --> 01:13:33.305
than you have
in your entire body.

01:13:33.307 --> 01:13:36.244
Oh, and I wish I had poached
your bloody deer.

01:13:46.154 --> 01:13:48.957
Quiney bequest removed, sir.

01:13:52.894 --> 01:13:54.227
I take
no pleasure

01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:56.365
in Judith's distress,
Father-in-Law.

01:13:57.164 --> 01:13:59.098
Or yours.

01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:01.467
It grieves me.

01:14:01.469 --> 01:14:03.505
I know that, John.

01:14:22.323 --> 01:14:25.325
Will you work with me
a while, husband?

01:14:25.327 --> 01:14:27.293
You can put some beer out
for the slugs.

01:14:27.295 --> 01:14:30.062
By the look of it, Anne,
you do better without me.

01:14:30.064 --> 01:14:34.903
I think I shall walk
a little.

01:14:45.313 --> 01:14:47.583
She did it for you, Will.

01:14:48.649 --> 01:14:50.819
You wanted a grandson.

01:15:16.711 --> 01:15:19.477
You didn't attend
the funeral.

01:15:19.479 --> 01:15:21.947
I was on my way home.

01:15:21.949 --> 01:15:24.920
The news reached London
after I'd left.

01:15:26.654 --> 01:15:31.023
By the time I got here,
he was already in the ground.

01:15:31.025 --> 01:15:32.759
It was summer.

01:15:32.761 --> 01:15:35.794
No corpse
remains unburied long,

01:15:35.796 --> 01:15:37.565
particularly
a plague corpse.

01:15:38.699 --> 01:15:41.036
Ah, this is
the page.

01:15:42.002 --> 01:15:44.907
August, 1596.

01:15:58.185 --> 01:16:00.087
Hamnet.

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:03.388
Shakespeare.

01:16:03.390 --> 01:16:05.527
Mm, there he is.

01:16:08.162 --> 01:16:10.862
I brought him a penknife.

01:16:10.864 --> 01:16:13.098
It was a special one
with a folding blade.

01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:16.436
It had his initials
engraved on the handle.

01:16:16.438 --> 01:16:18.170
He'd have loved that knife.

01:16:18.172 --> 01:16:21.609
I keep it with me all...
All the time.

01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:31.086
- Heh. Do you mind if I...?
- Please.

01:16:33.253 --> 01:16:34.586
Whenever I, uh...

01:16:34.588 --> 01:16:39.258
Whenever I trim a new quill,

01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:43.095
I imagine
that it's not mine,

01:16:43.097 --> 01:16:46.732
but his hand,
grown to be a man,

01:16:46.734 --> 01:16:48.834
and there he is, trimming...

01:16:48.836 --> 01:16:50.035
Trimming his quill

01:16:50.037 --> 01:16:51.704
with the knife
his father gave him

01:16:51.706 --> 01:16:55.375
on that joyful homecoming
so long ago.

01:16:55.377 --> 01:16:58.544
And then, when I, uh...

01:16:58.546 --> 01:17:01.748
When I dip the ink
and make a mark,

01:17:01.750 --> 01:17:04.750
it's still his hand I see

01:17:04.752 --> 01:17:07.285
and his words that I write,

01:17:07.287 --> 01:17:12.991
and then I imagine
that it's not me

01:17:12.993 --> 01:17:15.894
who thinks of him at all,

01:17:15.896 --> 01:17:21.634
but that I am dead
and Hamnet lives,

01:17:21.636 --> 01:17:25.336
and it's him
who thinks of me.

01:17:25.338 --> 01:17:29.775
People often ask me
how I've written so much,

01:17:29.777 --> 01:17:32.144
how I've found the energy
and dedication

01:17:32.146 --> 01:17:34.412
to sit alone at my desk,

01:17:34.414 --> 01:17:36.615
writing play after play
after play,

01:17:36.617 --> 01:17:39.121
but the answer
is quite simple.

01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:43.958
I was always in the company
of my son.

01:17:49.797 --> 01:17:52.067
My boy.

01:19:03.904 --> 01:19:05.804
You...
You sent for me, Father?

01:19:05.806 --> 01:19:09.709
Yes. Yes, Judith.
Thank you for coming.

01:19:09.711 --> 01:19:14.379
Your... Your new home
is comfortable, I hope?

01:19:14.381 --> 01:19:16.615
Well, there's a lot
of work to do,

01:19:16.617 --> 01:19:19.686
but my husband's
working hard.

01:19:19.688 --> 01:19:22.120
Despite all the shame
he brought us, he...

01:19:22.122 --> 01:19:24.125
He is
a good man.

01:19:28.930 --> 01:19:32.231
I visited
Hamnet's grave today,

01:19:32.233 --> 01:19:36.768
and I read his name
in the register.

01:19:36.770 --> 01:19:38.204
Oh, I'm glad of it.

01:19:38.206 --> 01:19:39.641
Anne...

01:19:41.408 --> 01:19:44.576
I know the plague.

01:19:44.578 --> 01:19:47.745
Many times in London it struck,
all the theaters were closed,

01:19:47.747 --> 01:19:51.986
so I do...
I know the plague, and...

01:19:53.119 --> 01:19:56.155
I was thinking today that...

01:19:56.157 --> 01:20:00.962
the Black Death is a scythe.

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:04.800
It is not a dagger.

01:20:06.333 --> 01:20:08.067
How's that?

01:20:08.069 --> 01:20:11.504
Never once did I see it

01:20:11.506 --> 01:20:17.012
strike a single person
and then depart.

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:23.851
How did Hamnet die?

01:20:25.987 --> 01:20:28.253
His death is recorded
in the parish register,

01:20:28.255 --> 01:20:30.025
but no mention of the cause.

01:20:30.925 --> 01:20:32.793
Plague, husband.

01:20:34.295 --> 01:20:37.397
The vicar pronounced it
at his funeral.

01:20:37.399 --> 01:20:40.232
Because that
is what you told him,

01:20:40.234 --> 01:20:42.802
and also, no doubt,
what you told the gravesmen

01:20:42.804 --> 01:20:44.504
who came to the greenwood

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:47.876
to find him already stitched up
in his shroud.

01:20:49.911 --> 01:20:52.010
But when I look
at the graves

01:20:52.012 --> 01:20:54.847
around about Hamnet's
and the register,

01:20:54.849 --> 01:20:56.982
I see that no scythe

01:20:56.984 --> 01:21:00.919
swung through this town
in the summer of 1596.

01:21:00.921 --> 01:21:05.357
In fact, precisely,
only five children were taken,

01:21:05.359 --> 01:21:08.160
and three of them
were newborns.

01:21:08.162 --> 01:21:10.094
Not like the other
plague years,

01:21:10.096 --> 01:21:12.363
where dozens upon dozens
and dozens

01:21:12.365 --> 01:21:15.502
were struck down
each time it struck.

01:21:17.872 --> 01:21:22.777
So, Judith, Anne,

01:21:23.711 --> 01:21:25.579
please tell me.

01:21:27.849 --> 01:21:31.148
How did my son die?

01:21:31.150 --> 01:21:33.121
He died of plague.

01:21:37.557 --> 01:21:40.295
I woke Mother in the night
with my cry.

01:21:43.398 --> 01:21:45.900
Hamnet's bed
was empty.

01:21:47.734 --> 01:21:50.501
Mother
searched the house.

01:21:50.503 --> 01:21:54.208
And then she thought
of the greenwood pond.

01:21:55.542 --> 01:21:57.942
<i>That was
his favorite place,</i>

01:21:57.944 --> 01:22:00.612
<i>even though
he couldn't swim</i>

01:22:00.614 --> 01:22:03.784
<i>and he'd never go
in the water.</i>

01:22:06.185 --> 01:22:08.155
<i>Around him...</i>

01:22:09.724 --> 01:22:12.090
<i>torn and shredded,</i>

01:22:12.092 --> 01:22:16.061
<i>were the final verses
of the poems</i>

01:22:16.063 --> 01:22:20.601
that I had conjured
and that he had writ.

01:22:22.336 --> 01:22:25.440
We prepared them
for when you came home.

01:22:29.342 --> 01:22:34.847
<i>Mother asked me
to get threads and blankets</i>

01:22:34.849 --> 01:22:38.987
<i>so that nobody would ever
find out how he died.</i>

01:22:43.423 --> 01:22:45.124
<i>That's Judith's story,</i>

01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:47.393
<i>and she's carried it
like a burden ever since,</i>

01:22:47.395 --> 01:22:50.595
but I say he died of plague.

01:22:50.597 --> 01:22:54.301
The vicar spake it
at his grave.

01:22:55.302 --> 01:22:57.568
And God accepted it.

01:22:57.570 --> 01:22:59.272
Millions of people died
of it,

01:22:59.274 --> 01:23:03.511
and Hamnet entered heaven
amongst that host.

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:08.580
Jesus would never
have denied him a place,

01:23:08.582 --> 01:23:11.250
in spite of what Judith said
we saw.

01:23:12.487 --> 01:23:13.820
Of course.

01:23:13.822 --> 01:23:16.155
Well, of course
he's in heaven.

01:23:17.891 --> 01:23:19.558
Hamnet didn't kill himself.

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:21.626
He only threw himself
upon the water.

01:23:21.628 --> 01:23:23.027
It was I that caused it.

01:23:27.801 --> 01:23:29.335
I killed him.

01:23:29.337 --> 01:23:32.240
- Judith, it's not so.
- I killed my brother.

01:23:33.806 --> 01:23:37.679
You see, all he wanted to do
was to please you.

01:23:39.046 --> 01:23:42.113
All that you cared about
was him,

01:23:42.115 --> 01:23:45.586
and all he cared about
was you.

01:23:46.887 --> 01:23:49.024
I was jealous.

01:23:51.725 --> 01:23:53.862
I was jealous...

01:23:55.229 --> 01:23:57.898
because Hamnet went
to school...

01:23:59.367 --> 01:24:01.032
and I had to work
in the kitchens

01:24:01.034 --> 01:24:02.936
because I was a girl.

01:24:04.572 --> 01:24:07.238
But I wanted your approval.

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:09.210
I wanted your love.

01:24:10.711 --> 01:24:14.979
And so I told him
that I would tell you.

01:24:14.981 --> 01:24:19.854
That you would finally know
who'd writ the verse.

01:24:23.489 --> 01:24:25.156
I didn't...

01:24:25.158 --> 01:24:27.327
I didn't mean it.

01:24:28.194 --> 01:24:29.460
I didn't mean it.

01:24:35.202 --> 01:24:38.106
He died of plague.

01:24:39.707 --> 01:24:42.010
God accepted it.

01:24:44.511 --> 01:24:46.947
It was only a little lie.

01:24:50.384 --> 01:24:52.753
He was only a little boy.

01:26:01.822 --> 01:26:03.955
You finished it.

01:26:03.957 --> 01:26:06.357
Thank you.

01:26:06.359 --> 01:26:07.862
My story's done.

01:26:09.529 --> 01:26:11.733
I can rest.

01:26:14.835 --> 01:26:17.038
Hamnet, please.

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.875
Stay a moment.

01:26:24.377 --> 01:26:27.648
We are such stuff

01:26:28.649 --> 01:26:31.219
As dreams are made on,

01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:35.486
and our little life

01:26:35.488 --> 01:26:38.959
Is rounded with a sleep.

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:15.923
I'm sorry.

01:28:17.123 --> 01:28:19.159
I think that...

01:28:20.461 --> 01:28:24.495
perhaps I may have caught
a chill.

01:28:27.568 --> 01:28:29.901
Ben Jonson,

01:28:29.903 --> 01:28:32.103
it is good to see you.

01:28:32.105 --> 01:28:35.139
Christ, Will,
you've had a time of it.

01:28:35.141 --> 01:28:37.709
Both daughters
caught up in scandals.

01:28:38.878 --> 01:28:40.478
Well, good for them.

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:43.382
Yes, retirement hasn't exactly
brought the peace

01:28:43.384 --> 01:28:45.750
- we might have hoped for.
- In my experience, Will,

01:28:45.752 --> 01:28:48.387
no one gets
what they hope for,

01:28:48.389 --> 01:28:50.455
but they do tend to get
what they deserve.

01:28:50.457 --> 01:28:52.424
And you think
I got what I deserve?

01:28:52.426 --> 01:28:58.295
Well, not all of it, perhaps,
but something, certainly.

01:28:58.297 --> 01:28:59.496
You lost a son.

01:28:59.498 --> 01:29:02.099
No man deserves that,

01:29:02.101 --> 01:29:04.169
though many men suffer it.

01:29:04.171 --> 01:29:06.405
I myself have lost
a son and a daughter.

01:29:06.407 --> 01:29:08.607
I know you did, my friend.

01:29:08.609 --> 01:29:12.076
But you have two daughters
still who love you

01:29:12.078 --> 01:29:15.414
and a wife
to share your bed.

01:29:15.416 --> 01:29:17.148
I have none of that.

01:29:17.150 --> 01:29:19.084
Mine own Anne
despises me.

01:29:19.086 --> 01:29:21.353
Yeah, well, you do
publicly insult her.

01:29:21.355 --> 01:29:22.854
You call her a shrew,
so, um...

01:29:22.856 --> 01:29:24.955
Yeah, well, I didn't say
she had no cause.

01:29:24.957 --> 01:29:26.791
Only that she does.

01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:33.432
You told me
that Southampton says

01:29:33.434 --> 01:29:35.166
you've led a little life.

01:29:36.636 --> 01:29:38.571
What an ass.

01:29:38.573 --> 01:29:42.007
Well, I mean,
you conquered England, Will,

01:29:42.009 --> 01:29:46.311
and returned victorious
to the bosom of your family.

01:29:46.313 --> 01:29:49.348
Ah, how is that little?
Is it little?

01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:50.749
Perhaps the second part.

01:29:50.751 --> 01:29:53.384
Well, the second part
is the best part.

01:29:53.386 --> 01:29:55.887
You made it home, Will.

01:29:55.889 --> 01:29:58.589
How many other conquerors
can say the same?

01:29:58.591 --> 01:30:00.325
What poets, huh?

01:30:00.327 --> 01:30:03.260
Anyone can die alone
and despised.

01:30:03.262 --> 01:30:05.097
- I mean, Marlowe was murdered.
- Oh.

01:30:05.099 --> 01:30:06.999
No one knows
which of his many enemies

01:30:07.001 --> 01:30:08.233
- did it.
- Mm-hmm.

01:30:08.235 --> 01:30:10.402
- I mean, Greene died in poverty,
- Oh.

01:30:10.404 --> 01:30:12.370
estranged from
all who knew him.

01:30:12.372 --> 01:30:13.606
- Kyd, the same.
- Mm. Mm-hm.

01:30:13.608 --> 01:30:15.572
I mean, no one knows
how Tom Nashe died,

01:30:15.574 --> 01:30:18.375
but if his filthy
dildo poems

01:30:18.377 --> 01:30:20.579
are anything to go by,
it wasn't in the bosom

01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:22.179
- of his family, hmm?
- I think not.

01:30:23.951 --> 01:30:28.018
And me? Well,
while I am not dead yet,

01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:31.589
I may soon be, for I am
out of favor with the king,

01:30:31.591 --> 01:30:36.661
and none will speak for me.

01:30:36.663 --> 01:30:40.598
But you,
you made it home, Will.

01:30:47.608 --> 01:30:50.778
So sorry. I'm fine.

01:30:55.548 --> 01:31:00.518
You've had your friends
and your family,

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:03.955
a full fire
and a full belly.

01:31:03.957 --> 01:31:07.026
And, by the way,
you've also written

01:31:07.028 --> 01:31:11.463
the greatest body of plays
that ever were or will be,

01:31:11.465 --> 01:31:13.601
you bastard.

01:31:15.569 --> 01:31:18.306
So, yes, my old friend...

01:31:20.707 --> 01:31:24.041
I'd say you got
what you deserved.

01:32:17.465 --> 01:32:19.065
Father?

01:32:21.835 --> 01:32:24.201
Today is a special day,

01:32:24.203 --> 01:32:28.673
and Mother and Sue have
prepared you a special present.

01:32:28.675 --> 01:32:31.809
Goodness,
what is this?

01:32:31.811 --> 01:32:33.844
It's our marriage license,
Will.

01:32:33.846 --> 01:32:35.312
What?

01:32:35.314 --> 01:32:39.250
Thirty-four years ago,
I put my mark on it.

01:32:39.252 --> 01:32:41.222
And now...

01:33:18.658 --> 01:33:20.895
Anne Shakespeare.

01:33:22.997 --> 01:33:25.900
You have
a beautiful hand.

01:33:27.333 --> 01:33:30.568
Sue is teaching me
how to write also.

01:33:30.570 --> 01:33:32.903
And by the time
you are better,

01:33:32.905 --> 01:33:35.941
I shall have written you
a poem.

01:33:35.943 --> 01:33:39.544
Well,
you will need...

01:33:39.546 --> 01:33:41.745
a penknife.

01:33:41.747 --> 01:33:44.351
This is for you.

01:33:47.087 --> 01:33:49.787
Thank you.

01:33:49.789 --> 01:33:53.090
And what should you like
to do today, Father,

01:33:53.092 --> 01:33:55.762
on this
special day?

01:33:57.398 --> 01:34:03.735
I know a bank
where the wild thyme blows,

01:34:03.737 --> 01:34:06.604
Where oxlips
and the nodding violet grows,

01:34:06.606 --> 01:34:10.074
Quite over-canopied
with luscious woodbine,

01:34:10.076 --> 01:34:13.512
With sweet musk-roses
and with eglantine:

01:34:13.514 --> 01:34:19.317
There sleeps Titania
sometimes of the night,

01:34:19.319 --> 01:34:24.625
Lull'd in these flowers
with dances and delight...

01:34:28.094 --> 01:34:30.961
You probably know
the rest.

01:34:30.963 --> 01:34:36.701
And there the snake
throws her enamell'd skin,

01:34:36.703 --> 01:34:39.437
Weed wide enough
to wrap a fairy in:

01:35:11.872 --> 01:35:18.110
Fear no more
the heat o' the sun,

01:35:18.112 --> 01:35:22.880
Nor the furious
winter's rages;

01:35:22.882 --> 01:35:28.152
Thou thy worldly task
hast done,

01:35:28.154 --> 01:35:35.227
Home art gone,
and ta'en thy wages:

01:35:35.229 --> 01:35:40.365
Golden lads
and girls all must,

01:35:40.367 --> 01:35:45.739
As chimney-sweepers,
come to dust.

01:35:49.842 --> 01:35:56.180
Fear no more
the frown o' the great;

01:35:56.182 --> 01:36:01.186
Thou art past
the tyrant's stroke;

01:36:01.188 --> 01:36:05.555
Care no more
to clothe and eat;

01:36:05.557 --> 01:36:09.329
To thee the reed
is as the oak:

01:36:10.730 --> 01:36:15.900
The scepter, learning,
physic, must

01:36:15.902 --> 01:36:20.908
All follow this,
and come to dust.

01:36:24.778 --> 01:36:28.879
Fear no more
the lightning flash,

01:36:28.881 --> 01:36:33.250
Nor the all-dreaded
thunder stone;

01:36:33.252 --> 01:36:38.423
Fear not slander,
censure rash;

01:36:38.425 --> 01:36:43.260
Thou hast finished
joy and moan:

01:36:43.262 --> 01:36:47.397
All lovers young,
all lovers must

01:36:47.399 --> 01:36:51.769
Consign to thee,
and come to dust.
