MOTHER: While I’m at the real estate
convention this weekend,

01:36.458 --> 01:39.042
I want you to finish your PSAT test book.

01:39.042 --> 01:42.833
‐ Oh, Ma, do you think we can skip
the coconut oil this morning?

01:42.833 --> 01:45.958
‐ It's a tradition.
Are you too good for tradition?

01:45.958 --> 01:48.667
FATHER: Lupe, we talked about this.
Your outfit, your hair...

01:48.667 --> 01:50.750
I mean, every day,
it gets more and more ridiculous.

01:50.750 --> 01:53.917
‐ Oh, Jesus wore dresses
and nobody judged him, right?

01:53.917 --> 01:56.125
‐ Everybody judged him,
they crucified him.

01:56.125 --> 01:58.542
‐ Your online grade book says
you received a 96.

01:58.542 --> 02:01.083
‐ What happened?
‐ It was just one question
about Judge Danforth.

02:01.083 --> 02:02.333
It was a dumb mistake.

02:02.333 --> 02:05.042
‐ There are no smart mistakes, Sunny.

02:05.042 --> 02:07.958
One little mistake can ruin
the rest of your life.

02:07.958 --> 02:10.750
‐ You look like a skunk,
a depressed skunk.

02:10.750 --> 02:12.792
‐ Thought we don't use
insults in this house.

02:12.792 --> 02:14.375
‐ Wipe that lipstick off.

02:15.917 --> 02:17.208
Now.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.250
‐ Now I'll pay attention
to the minor characters
so I don't get tripped up again.

‐ Fuck!

03:21.417 --> 03:23.875
‐ Munchie bag?
‐ Oh, man!

03:23.875 --> 03:25.042
Thank you.

03:25.042 --> 03:27.708
My dad was in full form this morning.

03:27.708 --> 03:31.417
Someone needs to seriously
depucker his asshole.

03:31.417 --> 03:32.875
‐ How is Logan?

03:33.917 --> 03:36.042
‐ Oh, real good.

03:36.042 --> 03:38.208
Look at all the squirt emojis
my butt caused.

03:39.208 --> 03:41.625
‐ Ah, at least you're wearing
underwear this time.

03:41.625 --> 03:44.458
LUPE: Sunny, when you start dating,
you'll see,

03:44.458 --> 03:47.833
you gotta keep 'em hooked,
gotta use what God gave you.

03:47.833 --> 03:50.667
SUNNY: [scoffs] What exactly
do you think God gave me,

03:50.667 --> 03:52.750
except a nightguard
and an overbearing mother?

03:52.750 --> 03:55.708
LUPE: Sunny, you can't be
embarrassed about this stuff.

03:55.708 --> 03:58.375
[bell ringing]
GIRL: Is Jason bringing the keg tonight?

03:58.375 --> 04:01.208
‐ Yeah. Oh, did I tell you?
We finally tried reverse cowgirl.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.750
‐ And? How was it?

04:02.750 --> 04:04.083
Amazing, right?

04:04.083 --> 04:07.042
‐ Yeah. I mean, it wasn't...
that great for me,

04:07.042 --> 04:09.083
but I feel like it looked cool.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.500
My butthole's not my best feature...

04:11.500 --> 04:14.500
‐ Girls are horse fucking and
I haven't even had my first kiss.

04:14.500 --> 04:15.958
I'm so behind.

04:15.958 --> 04:18.458
‐ Pretty sure that's not
what they mean, okay?

04:18.458 --> 04:22.042
‐ Eww, gross, is that
like a Mexican thing?

04:22.042 --> 04:24.125
‐ Yeah, I mean,
if your armpit hair's that long,

04:24.125 --> 04:26.083
I can't imagine what else is overgrown.

04:26.083 --> 04:28.083
‐ Eww! Oh my God.

04:28.083 --> 04:31.792
Glad you spent your free time thinking
about what my pussy looks like, Megan.

04:31.792 --> 04:34.875
‐ Oh my God, I don't.

04:34.875 --> 04:37.917
Obviously. I don't.

04:37.917 --> 04:41.000
‐ That was so funny.
She was really embarrassed.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.542
Listen, obviously boys like
your "au naturel" look.

04:43.542 --> 04:47.208
Meanwhile, the underwear my mom buys me
renders me invisible.

04:47.208 --> 04:49.917
Take a look. It's like sexual camouflage.

04:49.917 --> 04:51.875
‐ Oh, that's your underwear?

04:51.875 --> 04:55.250
Thought you just shaved
your nipples and pubes off.

04:56.500 --> 04:59.542
Our slumber party is gonna be bomb.

04:59.542 --> 05:02.625
We're gonna do face masks and binge
My Hero Academia. Perfect night.

05:02.625 --> 05:05.750
‐ Also, I have a thousand‐piece puzz
that I wanted to get my claws into.

05:05.750 --> 05:08.875
‐ Oh!
‐ And we can go through all the Halloween
candy that your dad confiscated.

05:08.875 --> 05:11.208
‐ If you can find it.
‐ I did and I ate it.

05:11.208 --> 05:13.083
[whistle blows]

05:13.083 --> 05:14.583
‐ Oh, fuck.

05:14.583 --> 05:17.083
When I look at Hunter,
I just creamed my pants.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.333
Who plays hockey in a cardigan?

05:19.333 --> 05:22.958
He's like...
He's like an athletic librarian.

05:22.958 --> 05:25.625
LUPE: I totally do not understand
the attraction.

05:25.625 --> 05:29.833
I mean, he's, like, cute, but he's got
major guidance counselor vibes.

05:29.833 --> 05:32.333
‐ Yeah.
LUPE: Well, maybe you should
invite him over

05:32.333 --> 05:34.958
for a little
"Disney+ and Thrust," huh?

05:34.958 --> 05:38.042
He can bang you doggy style
while you watch Lady and the Tramp.

05:38.708 --> 05:41.042
‐ How would we do the pasta thing
if he's behind me?

05:41.042 --> 05:43.792
[laughs]
‐ Also, you know I want
my first time to be romantic,

05:43.792 --> 05:46.500
looking into each other's eyes
as we make love.

05:46.500 --> 05:49.833
‐ Only serial killers stare into
each other's eyes while they fuck.

05:49.833 --> 05:51.917
It's like...
[whistle blows]

05:54.292 --> 05:56.792
Doesn't it feel weird?
Doesn't it feel weird?

05:56.792 --> 05:58.875
‐ Stop.
‐ Okay, exactly.

05:58.875 --> 06:01.000
‐ So don't do that.
‐ Doesn't matter anyway. Look.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.500
Megan Dillons has staked her claim.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.500
‐ Do you need to like a little...
‐ Well, it would be...

06:05.500 --> 06:06.750
‐ It's kind of dry.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.417
‐ How am I supposed to compete with that?

06:08.417 --> 06:09.625
‐ I definitely wouldn't lick it.

06:09.625 --> 06:12.042
‐ I don't know, deep‐throat a basketball?

06:12.042 --> 06:15.167
[whistle blows]
‐ Hello, ladies. Sunny, Lupe.

06:15.167 --> 06:16.833
‐ Hi, Kyle.

06:16.833 --> 06:18.833
‐ What's that behind your ear?

06:20.917 --> 06:24.500
Is that a flattened penny
from the Corn Palace?

06:24.500 --> 06:27.167
‐ She's never been there.
‐ Yeah, my mom doesn't let me go there.

06:27.167 --> 06:29.750
She's weirded out
by the phallic nature of corn.

06:29.750 --> 06:32.875
‐ Oh, I didn't even think about it
like that. I love that place.

06:32.875 --> 06:35.250
My church's youth group is throwing
a talent show next week,

06:35.250 --> 06:37.667
and so I'm premiering
some of my new closeup magic.

06:37.667 --> 06:39.542
You should come. My church is awesome.

06:39.542 --> 06:42.542
I mean, Lupe, does your dad's church
let you watch Harry Potter?

06:42.542 --> 06:44.250
Because mine did.

06:44.250 --> 06:47.500
‐ Kyle, how many times do I have to tell
you, I don't want to compare churches?

06:47.500 --> 06:50.042
‐ Okay, okay, I just think it'll be fun.

06:50.042 --> 06:51.167
Oooh!

06:51.167 --> 06:52.917

07:02.333 --> 07:03.792
It's so used!

07:03.792 --> 07:05.583
Man, I could never sit in here

07:05.583 --> 07:07.542
because it looks like you gave rides
to the entire football team.

07:07.542 --> 07:10.792
‐ Oh!
‐ And what if somebody I know
was given a ride?

07:10.792 --> 07:12.458
Oh! Hell no!

I should have saved my car

Boom, autobots pop out.

metaphor, that means that you have crabs.

08:02.708 --> 08:04.000
‐ What?
‐ Do you have crabs, Lupe?

08:04.000 --> 08:07.458
‐ No. It's a surprise.
‐ What is surprising about your vagina?

08:07.458 --> 08:10.125
‐ My vagina is awesome.
‐ Okay, so...

08:10.875 --> 08:15.167

is puberty is telling you

08:15.167 --> 08:16.875

08:16.875 --> 08:20.667
but just trust me
when I say it is okay to wait.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.917
When you finally take that first drive,

08:23.917 --> 08:28.042
you're gonna want it

08:28.042 --> 08:30.250
Oh, yes, Emma?

08:30.250 --> 08:34.208
‐ Uh, if I let a guy ride in my trunk,
that doesn't like count, right?

08:34.208 --> 08:36.625
‐ What if I want to drive my car alone,

08:36.625 --> 08:39.500
you know, just to make sure
that the oil still works?

08:39.500 --> 08:42.708
‐ Okay, okay, does anybody
have a real question?

08:42.708 --> 08:45.625
‐ Yes, Hunter.
HUNTER: It's a real question.

08:45.625 --> 08:49.958
So, how does giving a passenger "a ride"

08:49.958 --> 08:52.667
actually make a difference
in how a car drives?

08:52.667 --> 08:56.167
‐ Oh, well, just because the guy can tell

08:56.167 --> 08:57.708
if the...

08:57.708 --> 09:00.625
upholstery was ripped

09:00.625 --> 09:02.208
by the other passengers,

09:02.208 --> 09:05.458
so then the car can never get back

09:05.458 --> 09:08.375
that "new car feeling" again.

09:08.375 --> 09:10.833
‐ Yeah?
‐ You can't tear the upholstery.

09:10.833 --> 09:14.167
That's a myth.
It just stretches and then it goes...

09:14.167 --> 09:16.208

‐ Then why aren't we seeing
his car being inspected?

09:43.750 --> 09:47.167
Why is there no "his car" inspection?
‐ We don't know where his car is.

09:47.167 --> 09:51.333

‐ Dude. You gotta ask him out.
Don't lose momentum. Totally.

in the foot at the ammo store,

10:13.333 --> 10:16.708

The party is canceled.

35:03.750 --> 35:05.083

35:05.083 --> 35:07.375
Does he have like a giant
hairy birthmark on his dick?

35:07.375 --> 35:08.792
‐ Eww, no.

35:08.792 --> 35:11.458

on your mom's bed?

35:11.458 --> 35:12.667
Or was it on your bed?

35:12.667 --> 35:16.167
Did you have that little stuffed elephant
just staring right at you?

35:16.167 --> 35:18.000
Was it like involved in the action
or something?

35:18.000 --> 35:19.375
‐ Dude, stop.

35:24.625 --> 35:26.083
‐ Wait, was it bad?

35:26.083 --> 35:27.583
Did he do something to you?

35:27.583 --> 35:29.917
I'll fucking kill him.
‐ No, don't. No, no, no, no.

35:29.917 --> 35:31.083
God, no.

35:31.083 --> 35:33.042

We'll just take the next one.

35:58.583 --> 36:00.875
Okay, we've been driving
around in circles for an hour.

Shit, we're in a dead zone.

36:29.000 --> 36:30.250
Fuck.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.250
‐ Dude, what are we gonna do?

36:34.000 --> 36:36.958
‐ Oh, uh, my mom keeps a map
behind one of these seats.

36:36.958 --> 36:38.958
Can you? I can't...

36:38.958 --> 36:40.875

36:40.875 --> 36:41.958

36:41.958 --> 36:43.667
Wonderful.

36:52.167 --> 36:55.792
There's a greenish line here.
SUNNY: Mm‐hmm.

Traffic?

You're gonna go right out

Ah, you don't know Neil?

38:17.250 --> 38:18.208

38:29.125 --> 38:30.667

38:30.667 --> 38:34.125
You're gonna give yourself

38:34.125 --> 38:37.833
You'll go to 20‐Mississippi and then
you'll take a right at the doll museum.

38:37.833 --> 38:39.500
‐ Uh, are there any street names?

38:39.500 --> 38:40.667
‐ Hmm...

38:41.208 --> 38:43.083
You know, probably.

38:43.083 --> 38:46.167
So then you're gonna come to a rock...

38:49.875 --> 38:52.667

38:52.667 --> 38:54.958
There's a few houses
with bullet holes in 'em.

38:54.958 --> 38:57.917
You'll go six more Mississippis,
and you will be on the highway.

38:57.917 --> 39:00.125

I don't know what you got

39:05.292 --> 39:09.500
but if you got some time,
get up in that doll museum.

39:09.500 --> 39:11.417
You are gonna love it.

39:11.417 --> 39:13.125
It's beautiful, I got married there.

39:13.125 --> 39:14.542
‐ Oh.
‐ Congratulations.

39:14.542 --> 39:18.292
‐ Yeah, well, "congrats"
is not quite the word.

39:18.292 --> 39:19.833
LUPE: Oh.
‐ Hmm‐mm.

39:19.833 --> 39:21.042
BOTH: Sorry.

39:21.042 --> 39:23.042
‐ Something happened.

39:25.375 --> 39:27.083
SUNNY: What happened?

39:27.083 --> 39:28.625
‐ You wanna guess?

39:28.625 --> 39:30.667
‐ Uh, it was an amicable split?

39:31.583 --> 39:34.042
‐ No. Way worse. You wanna guess?

39:34.042 --> 39:36.917
‐ I don't really want to.
‐ No.

39:36.917 --> 39:38.875
‐ He did that thing from Footloose,

39:38.875 --> 39:42.500
where he had one...
one foot in each car window

39:42.500 --> 39:45.167
and he was sort of surfing,
but, you know,

39:45.167 --> 39:47.583
one started going faster
and veering a little to the right

39:47.583 --> 39:50.625
and one started veering
a tiny bit to the left,

39:50.625 --> 39:53.042
and he just split right in half,

39:53.042 --> 39:57.250
right up the seam of his balls,
and just right up the middle of his face.

39:57.250 --> 40:00.125
And just, the right half of him
was on one side,

40:00.125 --> 40:01.750
the left half of him was on the other.

40:01.750 --> 40:04.917
So we weren't married very long,
but we had a beautiful wedding

40:04.917 --> 40:07.208
amongst those shorthaired dolls.

40:10.667 --> 40:12.167
‐ How much for the food?

40:12.167 --> 40:14.667
‐ You know what? I like you two.

40:14.667 --> 40:18.625
Let's call it $2.67.

40:20.292 --> 40:22.875

40:51.583 --> 40:53.375

40:53.375 --> 40:56.375
You think these two Mexicans
got spicy tacos?

40:56.375 --> 40:58.625
‐ What are you talking about, our vaginas?
BILL: Yeah.

40:58.625 --> 41:00.750
‐ I'd like to put my burrito in that taco.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.625
With a side of beans
if you know what I mean.

41:02.625 --> 41:04.708
‐ I'm South Asian, so like that metaphor
doesn't track, actually.

41:04.708 --> 41:06.417
‐ What's the equivalent of your taco?

41:06.417 --> 41:08.458
‐ Rotis, or like naan or something.

41:08.458 --> 41:10.500
‐ They're fucking idiots,
so they won't even get it.

41:10.500 --> 41:12.500
‐ Why don't you show us?
‐ I don't think so.

41:12.500 --> 41:13.708
‐ Please leave.

41:13.708 --> 41:15.708
‐ If you take one step closer,
I'll pee on you.

41:15.708 --> 41:17.333
Seriously, I'll pee on you, dude.

41:17.333 --> 41:20.333
Okay, I saw a TED Talk that says
that peeing discourages sexual assault,

41:20.333 --> 41:23.125
so I intend on peeing on you,
and I don't miss, bucko.

41:23.125 --> 41:25.875

41:38.083 --> 41:40.125
Yeah. We know each other.

41:40.125 --> 41:42.208

44:43.292 --> 44:46.458
We're looking for Andy?
His Aunt Doris sent us here.

44:47.208 --> 44:49.000
‐ Oh, Auntie D?

44:49.000 --> 44:53.208
Yeah! Okay, if she says you're cool.
We can do that b'ness.

44:55.250 --> 44:56.542
Ow!

44:56.542 --> 44:57.708
[groans]

44:57.708 --> 44:59.500
Welcome to the kingdom.

44:59.500 --> 45:02.583
What can I get you fine females
this evening?

45:03.417 --> 45:05.208
‐ We need the morning after pill.

45:05.208 --> 45:06.625
‐ Oh, Levonorgestrel?

45:06.625 --> 45:09.750
That shit has been flying off my shelves.

45:09.750 --> 45:11.833
All these girls gettin' seeded up.

45:11.833 --> 45:14.125
Like to put that yogurt right in the cup.

45:15.667 --> 45:17.333
Check that shit out.
I got one more right here.

45:18.583 --> 45:20.958
‐ Um, yeah. Okay, that could be anything.

45:20.958 --> 45:22.875
‐ Nah, girl, it's the pill.

45:23.750 --> 45:25.000
Or speed.

45:25.458 --> 45:29.000
There's like a really small chance
it might be PCP.

45:33.833 --> 45:37.333
No, it's the pill.
Shit, you got me scared.

45:37.333 --> 45:38.625
It's one hundo.

45:38.625 --> 45:39.750
‐ No. No.
‐ What?

45:39.750 --> 45:42.333
No, I'm sorry, I'm not paying
for an unmarked pill

45:42.333 --> 45:44.208
that's probably PCP, no.

45:44.208 --> 45:47.000
‐ Really small chance it's PCP.

45:47.000 --> 45:48.375
Suit yourself.

45:48.375 --> 45:50.417
You want that labeled shit, I got you.

45:50.417 --> 45:54.208
I got Premarin, I got Ritalin,
Next Level Latisse.

45:54.208 --> 45:57.083
I got bad coke, I got ephedra.

45:57.083 --> 46:01.083
I smoked two of those, I saw God.
Looked like a rat.

46:01.083 --> 46:02.542
That's just Excedrin.

46:02.542 --> 46:06.000
I got meth, I got fake IDs.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.333
I got meth‐‐
‐ You sell fake IDs?

46:09.042 --> 46:11.125
‐ Do I sell fake IDs?

46:11.125 --> 46:12.625
Eh! Ha ha!

46:12.625 --> 46:16.333
Check it out. Look at this.
I got one that looks just like you.

46:16.333 --> 46:18.667
‐ Okay, well, Lupe,
if we find a 24‐hour pharmacy,

46:18.667 --> 46:21.458
then, I mean, maybe we can...
maybe we can use a fake ID.

46:21.458 --> 46:23.292
‐ Yeah.
ANDY: Oh, here we go.

46:23.292 --> 46:25.167
‐ Great.
‐ Oh, shit. Look at that.

46:25.167 --> 46:27.000
It's like a doppelbanger.

46:27.000 --> 46:29.917
‐ How much is it?
‐ Three hundo.

46:29.917 --> 46:31.292
‐ That's steep.

46:32.125 --> 46:34.083
Okay, um, how's...

46:34.083 --> 46:36.500
how's 50 bucks and a weed vape?

46:36.500 --> 46:39.333
‐ What? No.
‐ It's for the cause, dude,
I'll pay you back later.

46:39.333 --> 46:41.583
‐ No, I don't fuck with vapes.
That shit'll kill you.

46:41.583 --> 46:44.250
Four hundo.
‐ It was only three a second ago.

46:44.250 --> 46:46.667
‐ I don't know what to tell ya,
supply and demand, okay?

46:46.667 --> 46:48.667
Shit, like, fluctuates with the market.

46:48.667 --> 46:51.125
But like... I feel ya.

46:51.125 --> 46:53.333
If that's too much,
we can find another way...

46:53.333 --> 46:55.083
to pay.

46:55.083 --> 46:56.625
Some of that...

46:58.750 --> 47:00.417
‐ What?
‐ Okay, um...

47:00.417 --> 47:02.083
Okay, gross. Gross!
‐ Eww!

47:02.083 --> 47:04.167
‐ No.
‐ God, I'm 17.

47:04.167 --> 47:06.875
‐ We're both 17. What the fuck.
‐ Dude, so am I.

47:06.875 --> 47:09.750
I just have like literally never
drank water in my life.

47:10.625 --> 47:13.375
‐ Okay, yeah, no, this is...
we're... this is disgusting.

47:13.375 --> 47:15.375
We're gonna just go.
‐ Hold on.

47:17.917 --> 47:19.583
If this is the only way...

47:20.583 --> 47:22.500
then it's the only way.

47:22.500 --> 47:25.792
‐ What? No, it's not the only way.
This is not the only way.

47:25.792 --> 47:27.125
‐ I can't get pregnant, dude.

47:27.125 --> 47:29.708
‐ You're not gonna get pregnant,
but we're also not gonna
fucking suck his dick in a‐‐

47:29.708 --> 47:31.083
We're in a playground!

47:31.083 --> 47:33.667
‐ I'm running out of options,
I'm running out of time.
I have to do it.

47:33.667 --> 47:37.708
‐ Okay, if it's any consolation,
it's gonna be like so fast.

47:39.125 --> 47:41.625
‐ Uh, oh, goddamnit.
Okay, we don't have to do this.

47:41.625 --> 47:44.083
‐ I'm sucking his dick.
‐ No. No, no. No.

47:44.083 --> 47:47.292
No, no. I'm gonna suck his dick.

47:48.042 --> 47:49.875
‐ What? You can't suck his dick.
I'm gonna suck his dick.

47:49.875 --> 47:51.875
‐ I love you, we're in this together.
I'm gonna suck his dick.

47:51.875 --> 47:53.375
‐ I'm not gonna let you suck his dick.

47:53.375 --> 47:55.458
‐ My innocent little
precious little baby, okay?

47:55.458 --> 47:57.583
Doesn't mean anything to me, all right?
I've done this before.

47:57.583 --> 47:59.750
‐ I believe in her, she could do it.
BOTH: Just shut up.

47:59.750 --> 48:01.792
‐ Let me suck his dick.
‐ No, let me suck his dick.

48:01.792 --> 48:05.167
‐ It's my mess, it's my problem.
It's my problem, my dick.

48:05.167 --> 48:07.667
‐ No, I'm gonna do it.
‐ My problem, my‐‐ Lupe, please!

48:07.667 --> 48:09.583
I wouldn't be able to live with myself.

48:13.167 --> 48:15.375
Just don't judge me, okay?

48:15.375 --> 48:18.167
‐ What? I would never.

48:18.167 --> 48:20.417
‐ Oh, shit, that's a good‐ass friend.

48:23.667 --> 48:26.125
‐ I'm gonna suck it.
‐ Go in there and get it.

48:26.125 --> 48:27.125
‐ Okay.

48:27.125 --> 48:29.500
‐ I'm here if you need me.

48:30.833 --> 48:33.083
‐ Just don't skull‐fuck me, okay?

48:33.083 --> 48:35.708
‐ I can't even move my pelvis like that.

48:35.708 --> 48:37.167
‐ Okay.

48:39.875 --> 48:41.875
‐ Oh, fuck, your dick is pierced!

48:41.875 --> 48:43.083
‐ Hell, yeah!
[girls exclaiming]

48:43.083 --> 48:45.500
Oh, yeah, there was
so much blood at Claire's.

48:45.500 --> 48:47.000
You know, personally, I hate it,

48:47.000 --> 48:49.417
but it feels really good for the ladies.

48:49.417 --> 48:50.917
SUNNY: No!
‐ Oh, you'll see.

48:58.667 --> 49:00.250
‐ I don't know what I'm doing.

49:00.250 --> 49:02.667
I literally have no idea what I'm doing.
‐ Uh, right, okay.

49:02.667 --> 49:05.083
Um, just like pretend
you're eating a banana,

49:05.083 --> 49:06.625
but don't use your teeth.

49:06.625 --> 49:08.167
‐ Yeah, definitely don't use your teeth.

49:08.167 --> 49:10.292
‐ Okay, okay.

49:23.458 --> 49:25.708
‐ I'm sorry, I'm out, I can't do it.
[Andy gasps]

49:25.708 --> 49:27.583
‐ I can't do it.
ANDY: Uh...

49:27.583 --> 49:28.792
‐ Sunny.

49:29.417 --> 49:31.667
Sunny!
‐ Oh my God!

49:31.667 --> 49:32.958
‐ Sunny, th‐th‐th‐th‐the...

49:32.958 --> 49:35.625
LUPE: Th‐th‐th‐th...

49:37.417 --> 49:40.208
‐ Oh my God!
ANDY: What was it...? Oh, fuck!

49:40.208 --> 49:42.417
‐ Get it out, get it out!
‐ You ripped my dick!

49:42.417 --> 49:45.792
Holy shit, you're dead!
‐ Oh my God! Oh my God!

49:45.792 --> 49:48.083
[girls screaming]
‐ Oh, God!

49:48.083 --> 49:50.375
Oh! I want my junk!

49:50.375 --> 49:52.625
Oh, God! I can't see the eye!

49:52.625 --> 49:54.500
LUPE: Get in!
‐ You get back here!

49:54.500 --> 49:57.292
Oh, fuck me, I'm coming!
Oh, fuck, ow!

49:57.292 --> 49:59.083
SUNNY:
Is it in my hair? Is it in my hair?

49:59.083 --> 50:01.125
LUPE: Wait. No, no,
it's not in your hair anymore.

50:01.125 --> 50:03.208
It's not in your hair anymore.
It's on the floor, I don't know.

50:03.208 --> 50:05.000
ANDY: Ohhh! Fuck you!
‐ Oh my God!

50:05.000 --> 50:06.833
LUPE: Go, go, go!
ANDY: Come back here with my dick!

50:06.833 --> 50:08.875
‐ Oh my God, he's right after...
‐ Oh, fuck!

50:08.875 --> 50:10.958
LUPE: Go, go, go!
‐ Oh my God!

50:10.958 --> 50:12.875
‐ Fuck you!
‐ Oh, fuck.

50:12.875 --> 50:14.375
[tires squealing]

50:16.042 --> 50:18.708
‐ Oh my God. Oh my God.

50:18.708 --> 50:20.083
Who am I? Who am I?

50:20.083 --> 50:23.042
I literally almost sucked
a bedazzled penis for a fake ID.

50:23.042 --> 50:25.125
You did get it, right?
You stole it, you stole it?

50:25.125 --> 50:28.083
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐ Okay. And now I'm a thief.

50:28.083 --> 50:29.333
‐ Here you go.
‐ Okay, thank you.

50:29.333 --> 50:30.750
‐ All right.

50:30.750 --> 50:33.875
‐ What? Dude, this is a 60‐year‐old man.
What?

50:33.875 --> 50:35.542
‐ Let me see that. Wow.

50:35.542 --> 50:38.000
Well, if you don't wax your mustache,

50:38.000 --> 50:41.375
you could probably pull off
Pablo Jimenez III.

50:41.375 --> 50:42.583
‐ Are you fucking kidding me?

50:42.583 --> 50:45.833
I was on my literal knees for a fake ID
that I can't even use?

50:47.000 --> 50:48.208
‐ Oh, hey.

50:48.208 --> 50:50.708
But I also got...

50:50.708 --> 50:51.833
this.

50:52.250 --> 50:54.792
‐ Yes, okay, yes, yes, you sneaky genius.

50:54.792 --> 50:56.292
Thank you, thank God.

50:56.292 --> 50:58.417
Okay, um, maybe we can look up
what the pill is.

50:58.417 --> 51:00.750
Is there anything written on it?
‐ Let's see...

51:02.833 --> 51:05.208
Uh, a clown face or a "P" or...
‐ Okay, hold on.

51:05.208 --> 51:06.750
‐ I don't know.
‐ Hold on, let me pull over.

51:06.750 --> 51:09.000
LUPE: It also kind of looks
like a little worn down...

51:09.000 --> 51:10.875
like... it's kind of faded.

51:10.875 --> 51:12.042
Is the faded thing good?

51:12.042 --> 51:13.333
‐ What do you mean, faded?

51:13.333 --> 51:15.792
Faded like it's old?

51:15.792 --> 51:18.083
You know, like, would that be great?

51:18.083 --> 51:19.917
[ringtone chiming]
‐ Oh my God, oh my God.

51:19.917 --> 51:22.417
My mom, my mom is calling me.
My mom is calling me. What do we do?

51:22.417 --> 51:24.583
‐ I don't know. This is why
I ignore my dad's phone calls

51:24.583 --> 51:28.125
and I just pretend to be the busy signal,
like beep‐beep‐beep.

51:28.125 --> 51:30.667
Do you want me to try it?
‐ No, how is that helpful? No!

51:30.667 --> 51:34.208
‐ Well, she's also gonna know
if you're freaking out, so just be normal.

51:34.208 --> 51:36.667
Be normal. Be normal.

51:36.667 --> 51:37.708
[ringtone stops]
‐ Be normal. Yeah.

51:37.708 --> 51:40.667
‐ Yeah.
‐ Be normal. I'll look for the pill.

51:40.667 --> 51:42.250
‐ Normal.
‐ Yeah.

51:42.250 --> 51:43.958
‐ Be normal.
‐ Yeah, be normal.

51:43.958 --> 51:45.042
[ringtone stops]

51:45.625 --> 51:46.958

51:46.958 --> 51:49.917
MOTHER: [cheerfully]
Hi, Sunita, how are you?

51:49.917 --> 51:53.583
‐ Good, good, good, I'm good.
I'm so good! How are you?

51:53.583 --> 51:54.750
‐ Good!

51:54.750 --> 51:57.250
This real estate convention is so crazy.

51:57.250 --> 51:59.958
There are so many people
and new technologies.

51:59.958 --> 52:01.750
[Lupe coughing]
‐ Shh!

52:01.750 --> 52:04.042
‐ What was that?
[Sunny coughs]

52:04.042 --> 52:07.667
‐ I drank water and it went down
the wrong pipe, Ma. Sorry!

52:07.667 --> 52:09.875
‐ That's... that is really bad.

52:09.875 --> 52:11.875
Be careful when you are swallowing.

52:11.875 --> 52:13.125
‐ Yes.

52:13.125 --> 52:14.625
Yes, Mom.

52:14.625 --> 52:16.625
I'll be careful when I'm swallowing.

52:16.625 --> 52:19.458
‐ Okay. Well, I will see you tomorrow.

52:20.292 --> 52:22.542
Sunita?
‐ Yes, Mom.

52:22.542 --> 52:26.167
‐ When you finish your prep tests,
look in the cabinet above the microwave.

52:26.167 --> 52:28.167
I left a little surprise for you.

52:28.792 --> 52:30.375
Oh, I can't hide anything from you.

52:30.375 --> 52:33.583
It's a little bag of Hershey Kisses
I made for you when you finish.

52:33.583 --> 52:36.583
But no cheating, only after you finish.

52:36.583 --> 52:38.250
Okay, my good girl.

52:38.250 --> 52:39.542
I love you.

52:39.542 --> 52:40.958
Good night.

52:40.958 --> 52:42.375
‐ Good night, Mom.

52:42.375 --> 52:43.500
Love you.

52:53.292 --> 52:54.750
I'm a piece of shit, dude.

52:54.750 --> 52:56.500
‐ No, you're not.
‐ Yes, I am.

52:56.917 --> 53:00.042
She thinks I'm this perfect person,
her perfect little girl.

53:00.042 --> 53:01.917
Like... what if she knew?

53:01.917 --> 53:04.542
Like, what if she knew
that I almost like blew

53:04.542 --> 53:08.167
Monster Energy‐drinking goblin?

53:08.167 --> 53:12.917
Or that I had sex, I lost my virginity,
in our home bathroom?

53:12.917 --> 53:15.667
‐ She's not gonna find out, okay?
‐ I think I left the condom in the toilet.

53:15.667 --> 53:17.625
I think I left it in the toilet.
It's just swimming around...

53:17.625 --> 53:19.000
‐ Sunny, honey.
‐ ...it's like egg‐drop soup.

53:19.000 --> 53:21.208
‐ Sunny. Don't spiral, okay?

53:21.208 --> 53:22.917
Just breathe. Look at me.

53:22.917 --> 53:24.625
Everything is gonna be okay.

53:24.625 --> 53:25.667
Okay?

53:26.625 --> 53:28.417
Maybe you need some rest.
Give your eyes a break.

53:28.417 --> 53:29.458
Let me take a shift.

53:29.458 --> 53:32.333
‐ Listen, I'm gonna take a break when
all the sperm inside me are dead, okay?

53:32.333 --> 53:35.250
For now, we're going to go
to the Planned Parenthood,
we're gonna park out in the parking lot

53:35.250 --> 53:37.042
until we know that they're open.
‐ Sunny?

53:37.042 --> 53:38.875
Get out of the car, I'm driving.

KYLE: Hey, Sunny, I just...

1:36:02.167 --> 1:36:04.917
wanted to apologize
for freaking out last night.

1:36:07.208 --> 1:36:08.542
‐ That's okay.

1:36:09.250 --> 1:36:11.583
I was pretty freaked out,
too, to be honest.

1:36:11.583 --> 1:36:15.375
‐ You know, I realized something
this morning at church.

1:36:15.375 --> 1:36:17.042
God forgives.

1:36:17.042 --> 1:36:20.708

1:36:26.833 --> 1:36:28.292
I'm gonna hold onto that.

1:36:28.292 --> 1:36:29.917
And I‐‐ I think we'll be okay.

1:36:31.917 --> 1:36:33.083
‐ Yeah.

1:36:34.208 --> 1:36:35.333
Yeah.

1:36:36.292 --> 1:36:37.417
Thanks.

1:36:38.083 --> 1:36:39.833
‐ Take care, Sunny.

1:36:39.833 --> 1:36:41.750
Oh, Sunny, I don't know
if I mentioned it before,

1:36:41.750 --> 1:36:44.333
but my youth group
is doing a talent show next week...

1:36:44.333 --> 1:36:45.417

Oh, mija. Thank God you're okay.

1:37:27.750 --> 1:37:29.125
I was so worried about you.

1:37:29.125 --> 1:37:31.375
Thank you, God.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1:37:44.958 --> 1:37:46.542
really important,

1:37:46.542 --> 1:37:49.750
and it just took
a lot longer than we thought, so...

Look, I'm just glad you're okay.

Oh, mija, my mind went through
the worst‐case scenarios.

1:38:04.667 --> 1:38:08.833
Just kept imagining you getting into
all kinds of crazy situations.

1:38:10.167 --> 1:38:12.958

this is not the daughter I raised.

‐ Maybe it is.
‐ Do not talk back at me.

who deserves terrible things.

You know, growing up
I made a lot of mistakes.

1:41:50.458 --> 1:41:51.875
And I was...

far from perfect.

1:41:56.667 --> 1:41:58.708
Especially in my own mother's eyes.

My mother decided everything for me.

but the pharmacist refused
to sell me the pill,

for my daughter's friend.
