00:01.450 --> 00:02.730
<i>Previously on "The Outpost"...</i>

00:02.800 --> 00:05.390
There is a book full of names.
I want it destroyed.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.723
That's the Vex Rezicon,
the Book of Names.

00:06.730 --> 00:08.520
Talon, you found it.

00:08.590 --> 00:10.890
And it says right here
it's kept in Shrine Maer-Nokh.

00:10.900 --> 00:13.520
See how this road makes an "S"
between the two mountain peaks?

00:13.600 --> 00:15.980
That's the border front at Hadrion Pass.
I'm going after it.

00:16.059 --> 00:18.580
Across leagues of flesh-eating
Greyskin territory?

00:18.650 --> 00:21.240
You need that book to help us
defeat the Prime Order.

00:21.250 --> 00:23.420
Now I have at least two days.
There is still time.

00:23.490 --> 00:26.590
You will be sent to the mines
to pay for your crime.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.950
Tomorrow we reach
Gallwood Outpost.

00:28.960 --> 00:31.710
<i>We will hunt down a creature
resembling a woman.</i>

00:38.090 --> 00:41.470
Anyone loyal to Calkussar
dies today.

00:41.540 --> 00:43.270
And find me that Blackblood!

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:53.050 --> 00:55.270
You didn't turn.

00:57.980 --> 00:59.610
- Unchain me.
- Why didn't you turn?

00:59.620 --> 01:01.240
I really need to relieve myself.

01:01.310 --> 01:02.693
He's been infected
for four days already.

01:02.700 --> 01:06.120
Janzo!
Unchain me immediately

01:06.200 --> 01:11.300
or I will go on you
right here, right now.

01:11.370 --> 01:13.250
He's ever so dramatic, isn't he?
Open it up.

01:13.320 --> 01:14.750
Ahh.

01:14.830 --> 01:19.880
- Still nothing.
- Clearly! Unchain me.

01:19.960 --> 01:23.060
Talon. Hello, Talon.

01:26.170 --> 01:28.220
Thank you.
Ah!

01:28.300 --> 01:31.650
It can take upwards
of six days, but...

01:31.730 --> 01:33.600
But usually the vast majority
of people

01:33.680 --> 01:36.100
would have been infected by now.

01:36.180 --> 01:39.270
So if he lasts two more days,
he's not infected?

01:39.350 --> 01:43.110
Not necessarily.
Maybe.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.410
Wish I knew.

01:47.610 --> 01:49.870
Oh, wow.

01:49.940 --> 01:52.330
You're really afraid you're
going to lose him, aren't you?

01:52.340 --> 01:55.040
- No.
- You really love him.

01:55.050 --> 01:57.580
We need him,
in case you didn't notice.

01:57.660 --> 01:59.920
Why?
Because of yesterday?

02:00.000 --> 02:04.420
Beg your pardon, but I think you'll
find that I was the hero yesterday.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.890
You were.

02:13.890 --> 02:15.190
Very good.

02:17.390 --> 02:19.190
Sorry, what was that?

02:19.270 --> 02:21.520
Nothing.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.110
Let's chain him up.

02:24.190 --> 02:25.780
No, we need him in case
we need to fight.

02:25.860 --> 02:29.540
And what if he's the one
we need to be fighting?

02:29.620 --> 02:31.380
Well, if I can beat him
when he's himself,

02:31.450 --> 02:32.893
I'm sure I can beat him
when he's a Plagueling.

02:32.900 --> 02:36.050
Really?
Mm-hmm.

02:36.120 --> 02:37.670
Do you actually think
you can be...

02:37.740 --> 02:39.283
- Do you want to be chained up?
- What I want is to find

02:39.290 --> 02:41.430
that book before I turn.

02:41.500 --> 02:44.390
Now, are you going
to chain me...

02:44.470 --> 02:46.390
or are you not?

02:46.470 --> 02:49.350
- I'm not.
- Very good.

02:50.810 --> 02:52.440
Let's go, then.
What are we waiting for?

04:09.480 --> 04:11.430
"Book of Names."

04:52.930 --> 04:56.600
It's so damn hot.

04:56.670 --> 04:59.020
My lips are more cracked
than this ground.

05:01.440 --> 05:04.600
Did any one of you
bring extra water?

05:04.680 --> 05:07.620
You told us not to bring
extra water,

05:07.690 --> 05:10.040
that we'd be traveling
alongside a river.

05:10.110 --> 05:15.040
This is a river. Just not at
this time of year, apparently.

05:15.120 --> 05:19.490
So tell me, what is that dragon man
thing you two keep talking about?

05:19.570 --> 05:21.210
It's a Dragman, Garret.
It's a Dragman.

05:21.290 --> 05:23.800
Not a dragon man, a Dragman.

05:25.460 --> 05:26.420
Ever heard the term?

05:26.490 --> 05:28.460
Well, obviously not.

05:28.540 --> 05:32.060
If he had, he wouldn't have
called it a dragon man, would he?

05:32.130 --> 05:34.020
So what is it then?

05:34.090 --> 05:37.900
It's coming to find me,
whatever that means.

05:37.970 --> 05:40.770
I've been translating
the smith's books,

05:40.780 --> 05:43.890
and wherever there's mention
of the Book of Names,

05:43.900 --> 05:46.150
there's also mention
of the Dragman.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.830
This way.

05:59.110 --> 06:00.750
Water! Water!

06:11.590 --> 06:12.470
Right.

06:18.590 --> 06:19.440
I'm coming.

06:31.790 --> 06:32.700
Janzo.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.410
Well done, Janzo.

06:39.480 --> 06:41.910
Wait,
something's not right here.

06:41.990 --> 06:43.960
Why don't the Greyskins
have a settlement here?

06:44.040 --> 06:45.840
We're right by a water source.

06:48.380 --> 06:50.080
Um, uh, uh.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.250
Um, you need to get out.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.640
- What?
- Um, you need to get out.

06:57.340 --> 06:59.020
Get out!

07:02.820 --> 07:04.350
Where did he go, Janzo?

07:04.360 --> 07:06.980
My very educated guess
is it's a Teraprock.

07:06.990 --> 07:09.650
- What is that?
- It means get out, Talon!

07:09.730 --> 07:10.820
No way.

07:10.900 --> 07:11.910
No, don't!

07:20.280 --> 07:21.170
Talon?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.500
Garret?

07:26.820 --> 07:29.790
No, no, no, no.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.680
Oh, thank the gods.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.840
Garret, here.

07:40.850 --> 07:44.430
Get it off of him.

07:44.440 --> 07:45.360
Take one, Talon.

07:51.010 --> 07:53.360
You sawed off the tentacles
with that little dagger?

07:55.890 --> 07:57.240
Garret, breathe!

08:00.950 --> 08:02.830
Talon, what are you doing?

08:04.570 --> 08:06.490
Talon, what are you doing?

08:06.570 --> 08:09.590
Nordijorian clerics say it can
bring someone back to life.

08:13.290 --> 08:15.983
Well, do the clerics also say that
they could kiss people back to life?

08:23.380 --> 08:24.730
Garret?

08:24.810 --> 08:26.520
You've got to be kidding me.

08:29.260 --> 08:30.490
Are you all right?

08:30.560 --> 08:33.900
I feel like a horse
kicked me in the chest.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.530
I dreamt that you kissed me.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.250
She kissed you back to life.
Yes, that's what she did.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.750
How incredibly romantic.

08:48.280 --> 08:52.420
You know, those ten tentacled
Teraprocks, they can come this far,

08:52.430 --> 08:55.300
so you may want to take your little
staring competition elsewhere.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.880
Aah!

09:09.300 --> 09:11.770
You dove right in after him.

09:11.840 --> 09:14.770
I just stood there.

09:14.780 --> 09:16.780
There was nothing else
you could do.

09:16.860 --> 09:19.870
Otherwise you would have.

09:19.940 --> 09:22.280
I'm a coward.

09:22.290 --> 09:27.240
Cowards don't come deep into Greyskin
territory to help their best friend.

09:27.320 --> 09:29.840
Best friend?

09:34.330 --> 09:35.930
Greyskins.

09:37.970 --> 09:39.420
Garret, Greyskins.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.260
Come on, we need to go.

10:06.520 --> 10:08.080
Ambassador Dred.

10:09.820 --> 10:10.790
What have you found?

10:33.600 --> 10:35.640
Oh, relax, Talon.

10:35.650 --> 10:37.480
It's just from all the water
I swallowed.

10:37.560 --> 10:39.650
I'm not a Plagueling.
Not yet.

10:39.720 --> 10:43.530
I've been thinking. I don't
actually know much about you.

10:45.520 --> 10:48.330
All right.
What would you like to know?

10:50.190 --> 10:53.880
- Well, your father is Wythers.
- Mm-hmm.

10:53.960 --> 10:55.210
What about your mother?

10:55.290 --> 10:57.050
Well, my mother
was a washer woman.

10:57.130 --> 11:00.790
Died when I was very young.

11:00.870 --> 11:02.760
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

11:05.970 --> 11:08.050
So Wythers raised you alone?

11:08.060 --> 11:11.050
Me and my older brother
Jaelon, yes.

11:11.060 --> 11:13.350
You have a brother?

11:13.420 --> 11:16.680
Be a couple of years
older than me.

11:16.760 --> 11:19.190
We'd get into so much mischief
when we were young.

11:19.260 --> 11:22.400
Never any good at it,
but that didn't stop us.

11:26.150 --> 11:30.530
There was one instance
in particular.

11:30.610 --> 11:35.080
Jaelon had stolen a case of wine for
us from one of the quartermasters.

11:35.090 --> 11:37.760
Caught right away.

11:37.830 --> 11:41.580
And my father sent him down
to the lowest mineshaft.

11:41.590 --> 11:43.840
It was only meant to be
a day or two.

11:43.910 --> 11:47.430
Idea was to teach him
a lesson, I don't know.

11:47.510 --> 11:49.090
Except that he was
now surrounded

11:49.100 --> 11:52.640
by all the criminals
that my father had arrested.

11:52.710 --> 11:54.390
Oh, no.

11:54.400 --> 11:58.430
And hours into that
first day in the mine,

11:58.450 --> 12:00.780
My brother Jaelon
was beaten to death.

12:05.290 --> 12:08.070
I'm sorry.

12:08.150 --> 12:09.450
I didn't know.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.740
That's all right.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.700
So that's why you left
the Outpost.

12:15.780 --> 12:19.210
That was when I enlisted
in the Prime Order, yes.

12:19.280 --> 12:23.080
It was the one thing my father
hated more than anything else.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.420
The only trouble was
I didn't realize how quickly

12:25.500 --> 12:29.470
I would grow to hate them even more
than he did, if that's possible.

12:29.550 --> 12:31.590
So you came back?

12:31.670 --> 12:34.430
Mm, Commander Calkussar
summoned me back.

12:34.510 --> 12:37.260
I was tasked with the
responsibility of protecting Gwynn.

12:37.340 --> 12:41.320
- Why you?
- Oh, he knew he could trust me with her safety.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.320
Gwynn and I,
we grew up together.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.610
We played together as children.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.650
We were friends.

12:48.660 --> 12:50.830
She wasn't a little girl
anymore, was she?

12:50.910 --> 12:54.120
No. No, she wasn't.

12:55.870 --> 12:59.670
And I wasn't that scrawny
little boy who had run away.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.090
So why come?

13:05.330 --> 13:07.340
Why leave Gwynn?

13:07.350 --> 13:10.510
I'm infected. I didn't want
to be anywhere near Gwynn.

13:10.520 --> 13:11.890
Why else?

13:14.440 --> 13:16.060
Protect you.

13:18.310 --> 13:20.810
Help you find the book.

13:20.890 --> 13:23.940
- For Gwynn?
- For the entire Realm, Talon.

13:24.010 --> 13:25.318
I mean,
the things that you can do,

13:25.350 --> 13:28.610
the things that you
are capable of

13:28.680 --> 13:30.790
can shift the entire
balance of power.

13:33.230 --> 13:36.040
So that's why you're helping me.

13:36.120 --> 13:37.620
'Cause it's part
of your mission.

13:37.690 --> 13:40.290
No, I cannot let anything
happen to you.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.210
Why?

13:42.290 --> 13:44.510
Because Gwynn needs me?

13:47.370 --> 13:51.220
I am here, Talon,
because I want to be here.

13:51.300 --> 13:54.230
With you.

13:54.300 --> 13:55.890
Are you two coming or not?

13:58.710 --> 13:59.610
- Coming.
- Yes.

14:06.070 --> 14:09.450
Find Calkussar's daughter
and bring her to me.

14:26.500 --> 14:27.750
Get over here!

14:34.220 --> 14:35.100
Line up!

14:43.930 --> 14:46.690
This trench should bring us
right past the Shrine

14:46.760 --> 14:49.450
and hopefully hide us
from Greyskins along the way.

14:59.150 --> 15:01.420
Janzo!

15:15.120 --> 15:15.970
Ahh!

15:25.970 --> 15:27.810
They're barbaric.

15:27.890 --> 15:31.110
This is what life is like
in most of the Realm.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.780
Where I'm from, anyways.

15:38.440 --> 15:39.620
Where are you from?

15:41.650 --> 15:43.740
The Capital.

15:43.820 --> 15:45.170
Mimm's Burrow.

15:45.250 --> 15:47.450
Mimm's Burrow.

15:47.530 --> 15:50.580
I remember that place
when I was a child.

15:50.590 --> 15:53.510
I wasn't permitted
to go there, though.

15:53.590 --> 15:55.920
Not surprised.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.600
It's where the poorest
of the poor live.

15:59.670 --> 16:02.800
It was very bad
under your father.

16:02.880 --> 16:03.980
Oh.

16:05.880 --> 16:07.400
I'm sorry.

16:09.390 --> 16:12.860
Keep searching. Cut every
hand until we find her.

16:12.940 --> 16:15.450
But it's much worse
under the Prime Order.

16:17.900 --> 16:22.080
Well, poverty will be one of the first
things we solve when I get there.

16:23.690 --> 16:25.210
I hope you can, miss.

16:27.240 --> 16:29.620
But first we need to get you to safety.
I'll go find help.

16:29.700 --> 16:33.500
No!
No, it's too dangerous.

16:33.580 --> 16:35.430
Your life is more important
than my own.

16:37.370 --> 16:40.060
I misjudged you, Naya.

16:40.130 --> 16:41.600
You're brave.

16:43.300 --> 16:45.680
There is a watchman named Danno,

16:45.760 --> 16:47.390
the one that can't speak.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.150
He is loyal to me.
Maybe he can help.

16:54.120 --> 16:55.110
Thank you.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.780
Get out of here!

17:07.609 --> 17:10.160
Those Covenant bastards.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.750
Who would have thought
they'd be bad for business?

17:12.760 --> 17:14.920
Gluttony, debauchery, greed.

17:14.930 --> 17:18.250
They're the three pillars
of the Prime Order, aren't they?

17:18.260 --> 17:21.220
I think it's, uh, loyalty,
purity, strength.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.480
Munt, shut up!

17:25.770 --> 17:26.730
What the blazes?

17:44.650 --> 17:48.210
I want all women to line up
with your hands out,

17:48.290 --> 17:49.650
palms up.

17:53.450 --> 17:55.210
Ambassador,

17:55.280 --> 17:57.750
welcome.
Uh, can I get you a drink?

17:57.830 --> 18:00.430
Shut your mouth and get in line.

18:06.550 --> 18:07.440
Next.

18:14.820 --> 18:17.810
Ambassador, maybe if you could tell me
what it is that you're looking for,

18:17.820 --> 18:20.400
perhaps I could help.

18:20.480 --> 18:24.490
I am looking for a woman
with black blood.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.490
If you know who she is,

18:26.500 --> 18:29.080
you could save all
of these women a lot of pain.

18:33.490 --> 18:36.170
Well, I don't.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.930
And it's not me.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.000
Aah!

18:53.190 --> 18:57.100
You may have been somebody
special before we got here,

18:57.110 --> 19:00.490
but now... you're nobody.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.910
Destroy every bottle
and every barrel.

19:10.530 --> 19:12.620
I don't like your business,

19:12.690 --> 19:15.700
and I don't much like you.

19:15.720 --> 19:18.130
This swill makes a man
forget his place.

19:21.130 --> 19:23.380
I want this Outpost dry,

19:23.390 --> 19:26.420
and keep cutting every woman
until we find the Blackblood.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.480
Take her upstairs.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.590
Leave us.

20:01.140 --> 20:05.430
How is it
that you failed to mention

20:05.510 --> 20:08.770
in all your correspondence

20:08.840 --> 20:11.220
that the lady you serve

20:11.300 --> 20:14.940
is a surviving royal?

20:15.020 --> 20:16.690
I only learned it recently.

20:21.310 --> 20:23.900
Do you know where she is?

20:23.970 --> 20:26.490
First give me a way
to free my sister and mother.

20:29.270 --> 20:31.460
If what you tell me
leads to her capture,

20:31.530 --> 20:35.410
then yes, I will free them.

20:35.490 --> 20:38.960
It will.
She's like a rat in a cage.

20:51.960 --> 20:52.810
Naya?

21:12.360 --> 21:13.500
Hello, princess.

21:18.590 --> 21:20.840
- You swore to help me!
- Shh.

21:20.910 --> 21:24.340
- Touch me, I'll scream.
- You talk too much.

21:24.420 --> 21:28.090
You're gonna get us all killed.

21:45.680 --> 21:49.070
Wait.
What's happening?

21:49.140 --> 21:50.700
Greyskins.

21:50.780 --> 21:53.200
They believe that leaving
the body of a dead enemy

21:53.280 --> 21:55.710
is a waste of food.

21:55.780 --> 21:57.780
Are you saying...?

21:57.860 --> 21:58.920
They're going to eat us.

21:58.990 --> 22:00.023
But I don't want to be eaten.

22:00.030 --> 22:01.550
Nor do I,

22:01.620 --> 22:03.830
so maybe you should
think of something quickly

22:03.910 --> 22:06.330
to get us out of this.

22:06.410 --> 22:08.050
I've barely even lived.

22:08.130 --> 22:10.220
I've... I've never seen
the ocean.

22:10.300 --> 22:12.550
I... I... I've never been
with a woman before.

22:12.560 --> 22:13.600
- What? Never?
- Never?

22:25.740 --> 22:27.150
It's colipsum.

22:29.100 --> 22:30.570
Interesting.

22:30.580 --> 22:32.320
I knew colipsum came
from Greyskins, but...

22:32.390 --> 22:34.990
- What? When did you figure that out?
- Long story.

22:35.060 --> 22:36.700
Maybe you should have some.

22:36.770 --> 22:39.040
Might make this whole thing
a little less unpleasant.

22:40.160 --> 22:43.160
I do not use colipsum.

22:43.240 --> 22:46.760
Neither do I. Oh, that's another
thing I haven't done, colipsum.

22:48.240 --> 22:50.880
Wait. Why are they only
offering it to him?

22:50.950 --> 22:52.420
Why aren't they
offering it to us?

22:55.080 --> 22:56.720
He can smell it on your blood.

22:56.790 --> 23:00.260
- What?
- He can sense the Plagueling venom.

23:00.270 --> 23:03.180
You're not going to get eaten
'cause you're a Plagueling.

23:03.260 --> 23:05.890
How lucky is your bloody life?

23:05.970 --> 23:08.990
Lucky?

23:09.060 --> 23:10.520
No.

23:15.230 --> 23:18.410
Go. No, no.
Stop!

23:18.480 --> 23:20.410
No, you don't want to eat me.
Stop!

23:20.480 --> 23:23.580
Please don't eat me!
I haven't washed for weeks.

23:23.650 --> 23:26.410
Talon, we are running
out of options.

23:26.490 --> 23:29.430
Oh, I hate this.

23:31.790 --> 23:35.760
Talon, come and help me!

24:07.240 --> 24:08.160
Talon!

24:11.870 --> 24:15.630
- Come on.
- That's magnificent.

24:15.710 --> 24:18.100
- Janzo, come!
- Go!

24:20.840 --> 24:21.690
Wait.

24:25.010 --> 24:27.600
Talon, come on.

24:27.680 --> 24:29.900
Before they turn
their attention back on us.

24:42.020 --> 24:45.080
Talon, are you all right?

24:47.740 --> 24:49.880
I sent him to his death.

24:49.960 --> 24:51.790
You could say that,

24:51.870 --> 24:54.550
or you could say that it
sacrificed its life to save ours.

24:54.630 --> 24:56.890
It didn't have a choice.
It had to obey me.

24:56.960 --> 25:00.670
Talon, it's not exactly... I mean,
it killed innocent people.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.480
And he saved my life
more than once.

25:06.760 --> 25:09.560
That's it.
Shrine Maer-Nokh.

25:09.570 --> 25:11.440
We can get there by morning.

25:14.060 --> 25:15.400
Oh, well done.

25:15.410 --> 25:17.410
Well done.
You hear that, Talon?

25:17.480 --> 25:20.860
We'll have you more demon
names before you know it.

25:20.940 --> 25:23.320
More names will lead
to more killing.

25:23.400 --> 25:26.070
Talon, it saved our lives.

25:26.090 --> 25:28.200
Now with more of them,
we can take back the Realm.

25:28.280 --> 25:30.160
We can free the people.

25:30.240 --> 25:31.830
Talon, listen to me.

25:31.910 --> 25:34.420
You promised the smith
that you would find the book,

25:34.500 --> 25:37.590
but in finding the book doesn't
mean that you have to use it.

25:37.600 --> 25:38.840
You said that yourself.

25:38.910 --> 25:40.880
We cannot turn back now.

25:40.960 --> 25:42.350
Come on.

25:54.970 --> 25:56.690
I told her to stay here.

25:56.770 --> 25:58.770
Take three squads,
search these tunnels.

25:58.780 --> 26:01.360
Find her and bring her to me.

26:01.440 --> 26:03.740
My patience has expired
with you.

26:03.810 --> 26:06.200
I'll find another way to be useful.
I swear it.

26:06.270 --> 26:07.570
Oh, I'm sure you will,

26:07.650 --> 26:10.710
or your mother and sister
will pay the price.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.750
You are dead.

26:18.830 --> 26:20.680
Quiet!

26:20.760 --> 26:22.640
Be quiet, will you?

26:24.290 --> 26:25.930
Aah!

26:26.000 --> 26:27.090
Damn you, bitch!

26:27.100 --> 26:28.060
Get her.

26:37.470 --> 26:41.070
You think I'd make it easy
for you to get your revenge?

26:41.140 --> 26:43.280
To kill me
or whatever your plan is?

26:43.350 --> 26:45.830
I'm not gonna kill you,

26:45.910 --> 26:49.780
not that I haven't thought about
breaking every scrawny bone in your body

26:49.860 --> 26:52.500
since you put me down
in this hellhole.

26:52.580 --> 26:55.960
Well, then,
you're selling me to Dred?

26:57.920 --> 27:00.130
No, princess.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.600
I'm helping you escape.

27:08.100 --> 27:10.550
Why didn't you just say that
in the first place?

27:10.630 --> 27:13.360
'Cause you wouldn't shut your
piehole long enough, would you?

27:13.430 --> 27:15.280
Come on, Danno, move.

27:35.210 --> 27:37.830
This is Sill.
She'll smuggle you out of here.

27:37.910 --> 27:43.130
Sill, this is Lady Calkussar, or
Queen Rosmund, take your pick.

27:43.200 --> 27:47.010
Your Majesty, forgive me
if I don't kneel or bow

27:47.080 --> 27:50.470
or whatever it is that you do
for disenfranchised royalty.

27:50.550 --> 27:53.900
A little hard on the old knees.

27:53.970 --> 27:56.020
And I'm supposed to trust her?

27:56.090 --> 27:58.810
No, she's not to be trusted.
She's a crook.

27:58.890 --> 28:01.900
But she's predictable, which
is just as good, ain't it?

28:01.910 --> 28:03.690
Um, no.

28:03.770 --> 28:05.690
No, it's not.

28:05.770 --> 28:07.360
Why would you help me?

28:07.370 --> 28:09.710
Gold.
And favors.

28:09.780 --> 28:11.660
For that, you could sell me
to the Prime Order.

28:11.730 --> 28:13.240
They might give me gold,

28:13.250 --> 28:16.870
but most likely,
they'd just kill both of us.

28:16.950 --> 28:18.410
Then what do you want?

28:18.420 --> 28:20.420
A head's weight in gold,

28:20.430 --> 28:22.080
and my freedom.

28:22.090 --> 28:25.500
If and when you're in power,
you can give it to me.

28:25.580 --> 28:27.050
We've already searched
down there.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.670
They're searching for her
down the mine.

28:28.750 --> 28:30.180
Come on.
We're running out of time.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.840
It looks like I don't
have much choice.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.728
- I agree to your demands.
- Oh, good. Let's go.

28:36.260 --> 28:39.360
- There's nowhere to go.
- But there is.

28:43.690 --> 28:47.230
- I'll never make that. - I've smuggled
hundreds of swords and armored suits

28:47.310 --> 28:50.620
across this wall. I can damn sure
smuggle a bag of bones like you.

28:50.700 --> 28:52.960
Let's go.

28:53.030 --> 28:54.570
Marshal.

28:54.650 --> 28:57.240
I'm not Marshal anymore.

28:57.320 --> 29:00.300
I don't deserve to be.

29:00.370 --> 29:01.750
We'll talk about that
along the way.

29:01.830 --> 29:03.580
Oh, I'm not coming.

29:03.590 --> 29:05.250
You must.

29:05.330 --> 29:07.800
The Outpost is my home.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.920
I was born here.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.430
My father and my father's father
were born here.

29:14.500 --> 29:17.110
I can't just let
those bastards take it.

29:19.180 --> 29:20.900
I understand.

29:24.640 --> 29:27.820
Gwynn...

29:27.890 --> 29:30.440
Your Majesty.

29:30.520 --> 29:32.700
If I don't make it
through this mess...

29:36.030 --> 29:38.250
and you happen
to see Garret alive...

29:43.660 --> 29:45.220
tell him...

29:48.500 --> 29:49.720
I'll tell him.

30:01.840 --> 30:04.480
- Which way are we going?
- This way.

30:04.550 --> 30:06.070
Look busy.

30:12.020 --> 30:13.820
Don't come any closer.

30:13.900 --> 30:16.660
We've been infected.

30:16.730 --> 30:18.620
Is there another way
out of this chamber?

30:18.690 --> 30:20.990
It's a dead end.

30:21.070 --> 30:25.080
I mean, why do you think they stick
Plaguelings like us down here?

30:25.160 --> 30:27.760
Plaguelings?

30:27.840 --> 30:31.630
- Come on, let's go.
- Come on, move. Hurry!

30:39.810 --> 30:42.118
I found some more wenches that
are in need of indoctrination.

30:49.680 --> 30:51.730
More loot, sir.

30:51.740 --> 30:53.330
Add it to the pile.

31:01.490 --> 31:04.590
Looks like you'll leave here
a rich man, Ambassador.

31:04.660 --> 31:07.370
Funny.

31:07.450 --> 31:10.090
I spent my whole life
in the wrong career.

31:10.170 --> 31:12.420
Robbery's so much more
lucrative.

31:12.430 --> 31:15.670
Spoils of war
liberated from traitors,

31:15.750 --> 31:17.180
I hardly call that robbery.

31:17.250 --> 31:20.350
There's plenty of my gold
in that pile.

31:20.420 --> 31:22.220
How am I a traitor?

31:22.300 --> 31:24.430
All my life I've done nothing
but serve the Realm,

31:24.440 --> 31:28.280
fed its soldiers,
kept them entertained.

31:28.360 --> 31:31.270
Gambling, drinking, and whoring.

31:31.280 --> 31:34.690
Those are expressly forbidden.

31:34.770 --> 31:38.790
It was your soldiers that
turned this house into whoring.

31:38.870 --> 31:41.820
Whoring is when you pay
for services.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.410
Has any money changed hands?

31:44.490 --> 31:46.580
Spoils of war.

31:46.660 --> 31:49.170
- How do they taste?
- What?

31:49.240 --> 31:51.250
Those boots you're licking.

31:51.330 --> 31:53.170
If you think you're too old...

31:53.180 --> 31:54.590
Marshal!

31:54.660 --> 31:55.930
I'm eating.

32:00.290 --> 32:02.020
Next time, Mistress.

32:04.150 --> 32:06.150
There won't be
a next time, Higgs.

32:16.900 --> 32:20.500
Well, it's not exactly the
most inviting place I've seen.

32:20.570 --> 32:22.780
We won't be here long.

32:22.860 --> 32:24.420
Let's go.

33:22.750 --> 33:24.100
Talon.

33:28.730 --> 33:30.850
The Vex Rezicon.

33:30.930 --> 33:33.350
The book of denomination,

33:33.430 --> 33:38.280
by Lord Yannu Metahkken Rino
Faxtinus Leitch.

33:42.610 --> 33:45.420
- It's gone.
- But only just recently.

33:45.490 --> 33:47.080
Why?

33:47.160 --> 33:48.710
Who?

33:50.610 --> 33:53.500
Well, it can't be a coincidence.

33:53.570 --> 33:57.250
We almost died, multiple times,

33:57.260 --> 33:59.930
for nothing.

34:00.010 --> 34:02.170
All those names lost.

34:02.250 --> 34:04.430
So now what?

34:04.440 --> 34:06.050
We just give up

34:06.130 --> 34:08.480
and go back to the Outpost?
No.

34:10.469 --> 34:14.280
Someone built a shrine
for this book.

34:14.350 --> 34:16.909
But then why would they make
the book itself so fragile?

34:40.330 --> 34:43.920
Wait, what is this?

34:44.000 --> 34:46.179
Could this be the Dragman?

34:46.250 --> 34:50.400
Except the smith said the Dragman
will find you, not you will find it.

34:53.179 --> 34:55.889
Well, whatever it is,

34:55.969 --> 34:57.650
must be important

34:57.660 --> 34:59.610
for someone to hide it so well.

35:02.640 --> 35:04.570
Maybe the book was a decoy,

35:04.650 --> 35:08.070
another layer of protection.
Talon...

35:08.150 --> 35:11.580
I think that this
is the Vex Rezicon,

35:11.650 --> 35:14.580
the Book of Names.

35:14.660 --> 35:16.750
But if that's the book,

35:16.820 --> 35:18.220
then how do we read it?

35:25.880 --> 35:26.770
Come on.

35:30.050 --> 35:31.940
Down here.
Quiet.

35:36.770 --> 35:38.070
Shh.

35:40.390 --> 35:42.160
Keep it down.

35:50.780 --> 35:52.540
This is madness.

35:52.620 --> 35:54.120
What do you hope to accomplish?

35:54.130 --> 35:55.880
We take back the Nightshade.

35:55.960 --> 35:58.460
- And then what?
- We take back the Outpost.

35:58.530 --> 36:02.460
- And after that? - Then the Prime Order
will send more armies to kill us all.

36:02.540 --> 36:06.340
Good.
So you've thought it through.

36:06.420 --> 36:08.130
We're as good as dead
either way.

36:08.210 --> 36:11.230
Listen, I have lived through
changes in command.

36:11.300 --> 36:14.220
I have survived war.
I've survived famine.

36:14.230 --> 36:17.520
I've outlived my enemies.
Men come and go,

36:17.590 --> 36:20.310
but I mind my business
and I survive!

36:20.390 --> 36:23.480
- This is different, Elinor!
- How?

36:23.560 --> 36:26.530
Dred don't want your libations,

36:26.600 --> 36:28.820
or your colipsum.

36:28.900 --> 36:33.080
Trust me, he's not gonna spare
you 'cause you bake a good cake.

36:34.990 --> 36:37.920
You grew up here like me.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.670
Are you gonna let
those Prime Order bags of scum

36:40.740 --> 36:42.590
take our home without a fight?

36:48.750 --> 36:53.440
All right.
What you got in mind?

36:53.510 --> 36:55.020
That's more like it.

36:58.260 --> 37:00.190
Right.

37:00.270 --> 37:01.530
Come on.

37:03.760 --> 37:06.270
Something doesn't make sense.

37:06.350 --> 37:08.730
The Prime Order obviously
went through a lot of trouble

37:08.810 --> 37:10.860
and expense to burn that book.

37:10.940 --> 37:12.787
Why under the gods
aren't you turning Plagueling?

37:12.820 --> 37:14.740
That's what I don't understand.

37:14.820 --> 37:17.700
I mean, why they would go to all
that trouble to burn the book

37:17.780 --> 37:20.370
instead of just keeping it
for themselves?

37:20.450 --> 37:23.080
It has no value to them.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.380
Only a Blackblood can use it.

37:25.450 --> 37:27.090
They just want
to keep it from me.

37:27.100 --> 37:30.590
Right, but wouldn't it
be easier just to kill you?

37:30.670 --> 37:32.930
They tried to.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.230
They sent the Bones, remember?

37:35.310 --> 37:37.110
And I wasn't so easy to kill.

37:38.980 --> 37:40.560
But Dred went through
a lot of trouble

37:40.630 --> 37:43.060
to find and burn
that book, didn't he?

37:43.140 --> 37:46.490
Now, surely he would go
through just as much trouble

37:46.570 --> 37:49.610
to find and kill you.

37:49.620 --> 37:51.110
And what?

37:51.190 --> 37:53.250
Send an army?

37:59.360 --> 38:01.800
They could be marching
on the Outpost as we speak.

38:04.700 --> 38:07.260
I have to warn Gwynn.

39:12.440 --> 39:13.900
Where's Dred?

39:13.980 --> 39:16.860
Moved into Calkussar's house.

39:16.940 --> 39:18.360
What do you want?

39:18.380 --> 39:21.080
Oh, just his throat slit,
that's all.

39:21.090 --> 39:22.710
I guess you'll do.

39:24.920 --> 39:26.380
This is treason.

39:28.450 --> 39:30.750
You'll all be hanged.

39:30.760 --> 39:32.680
Well, I guess you'll never know.

39:36.770 --> 39:37.680
Aah!

39:39.440 --> 39:40.480
Good boy, Munt.

39:45.860 --> 39:49.230
Oi, oi, listen up.

39:49.310 --> 39:51.610
All right.

39:51.690 --> 39:55.120
There's about a hundred
of the bastards out there.

39:55.190 --> 39:59.620
They're well-armed
and they're well-trained.

39:59.700 --> 40:03.290
Some would say we don't stand
a chance in a fair fight,

40:03.370 --> 40:05.290
so we don't give them
a fair fight.

40:07.320 --> 40:09.540
We wait till the moon is high,

40:09.620 --> 40:12.380
and we take them out one by one,

40:12.450 --> 40:14.880
soul by soul, from the next

40:14.960 --> 40:16.810
to the next to the next.

40:16.880 --> 40:20.590
Are you with me?

40:20.670 --> 40:22.930
This is our only chance, okay?

40:23.010 --> 40:26.400
Let's have it.
Now come on, look lively.

41:02.040 --> 41:03.900
Cut them off
so there's no escape.
