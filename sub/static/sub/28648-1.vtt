DAVID [VOICEOVER]:
Dad, I continue

01:52.056 --> 01:54.805
to write to you in
spite of your silence,

01:54.807 --> 01:57.078
so that the bond
won't be broken,

01:57.080 --> 01:58.998
so that one day I won't
come upon a stranger

01:59.000 --> 02:04.533
who might be my father, so
that I won't forget you.

02:04.535 --> 02:06.263
Is it still a matter of anger?

02:10.422 --> 02:13.429
Anger over my
forthright announcement?

02:13.431 --> 02:16.629
A string of words which
changes the course of my life,

02:16.631 --> 02:17.718
but not yours?

02:21.814 --> 02:24.951
Do you not want to speak
with me, to hear my laughter?

02:27.478 --> 02:30.325
Strangely, the less I see you,
the more I become like you.

02:33.717 --> 02:36.339
I find you in mirrors.

02:36.341 --> 02:38.388
I have your hair.

02:38.390 --> 02:40.372
I have the warmth of
your hands in mine,

02:40.374 --> 02:41.717
even in the middle of winter.

02:50.037 --> 02:54.483
I surprise myself by wearing the
turtlenecks I hated as a child.

02:54.485 --> 02:58.387
You know, the ones you always
wore when we lived in London?

02:58.389 --> 03:00.179
I have the same bald
patch in my beard

03:00.181 --> 03:02.961
when I go without shaving.

03:02.963 --> 03:04.563
I hope the strange
adventure you're on

03:04.565 --> 03:07.539
is bringing you happiness.

03:07.541 --> 03:08.948
Raising pigs in Israel?

03:11.317 --> 03:15.506
Couldn't you play golf
like everyone else?

03:15.508 --> 03:20.115
Are you hoping to provoke
God, to get an answer?

03:23.764 --> 03:28.626
I hope you'll find one
and come back to me.

03:28.628 --> 03:30.098
Send my regards to your pigs.

03:32.468 --> 03:35.763
You, who never let me have
so much as a goldfish.

03:38.995 --> 03:41.777
I have an offer to make you.

03:41.779 --> 03:43.089
I'm listening.

03:43.091 --> 03:45.841
How about, instead of
watching your shitty play again,

03:45.843 --> 03:48.593
you let a handsome man
take you to dinner?

03:48.595 --> 03:51.344
That sounds awesome.

03:51.346 --> 03:52.465
Let me know if you find any.

03:52.467 --> 03:54.034
I should just leave
you here for that.

How are you, sir?

05:43.469 --> 05:44.459
Come on.

05:44.461 --> 05:45.163
What?

05:45.165 --> 05:46.411
We have a problem.

05:46.413 --> 05:47.275
Yeah.

05:47.277 --> 05:48.267
Mr. Rosenmerck?

05:48.269 --> 05:49.197
Mr. Rosenmerck?

06:04.396 --> 06:06.890
12 nipples, 13 piglets.

06:06.892 --> 06:07.914
This one is the little one.

06:07.916 --> 06:08.746
Yeah?

06:08.748 --> 06:09.546
He's weak.

06:09.548 --> 06:10.666
- Oh, he's weak?
- Yeah.

06:10.668 --> 06:11.466
So wait a minute.

06:11.468 --> 06:12.618
So, I still don't follow.

06:12.620 --> 06:14.506
Uh... you want me to
give him the bottle?

06:14.508 --> 06:15.276
Yes.

06:17.388 --> 06:18.378
Uh.
OK.

06:18.380 --> 06:19.209
OK.

06:19.211 --> 06:20.233
I'll try it.

06:20.235 --> 06:22.185
I mean, it's a
little ridiculous.

06:22.187 --> 06:22.923
Yeah.

06:28.107 --> 06:29.609
I shouted.
Still nothing.

06:29.611 --> 06:30.312
I shouted.

06:30.314 --> 06:31.593
I rang the doorbell.

06:31.595 --> 06:34.505
And he just rocked his pig,
cradling it like a baby.

06:34.507 --> 06:35.529
Can you imagine?

06:35.531 --> 06:36.360
Pretending not to hear me?

06:36.362 --> 06:39.048
I think the man's a degenerate.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.296
Did you change it at the top?

06:40.298 --> 06:41.032
Yes.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.280
Are we going to start?

06:42.282 --> 06:43.368
Scrub, scrub, Rivka.

06:43.370 --> 06:44.457
You need more detergent.

06:44.459 --> 06:45.481
RIVKA: I did that already.

06:45.483 --> 06:47.688
Never going to
get this pig off me.

06:47.690 --> 06:49.512
Do you think we should
just throw it all out?

06:49.514 --> 06:51.176
Check the Torah.
Maybe one washing isn't enough.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.904
- Dad, are we going to start?
- Yes.

06:52.906 --> 06:53.736
OK.

06:53.738 --> 06:54.505
So.

06:56.489 --> 06:59.111
Dear Mr. Rosenmerck,
this is my third letter

06:59.113 --> 07:00.616
to you regarding your pig farm.

07:00.618 --> 07:02.023
- RIVKA: It's your second letter.
- Exactly.

07:02.025 --> 07:04.167
He'll want to point out that
it's only my second letter,

07:04.169 --> 07:06.119
which he can only do by
replying and acknowledging

07:06.121 --> 07:08.007
- that he received my first one.
- Clever.

07:08.009 --> 07:09.319
Very clever.

07:09.321 --> 07:10.887
Yes, so please don't
make me explain my strategy

07:10.889 --> 07:12.327

This is my third letter to
you regarding your pig farm.

07:15.817 --> 07:17.863
You want me to write it again?

07:17.865 --> 07:19.494
No, I'm just starting again.

07:19.496 --> 07:20.264
Oh, OK.

07:30.152 --> 07:31.430
Hey.

07:31.432 --> 07:32.711
Hey, what are you doing?

07:34.888 --> 07:38.693
You can't wake me up
like this every night.

07:38.695 --> 07:40.998
I can't take it.

07:41.000 --> 07:41.797
Hey.

07:41.799 --> 07:43.303
What... what are you doing?

07:47.783 --> 07:49.285
I need my sleep.

07:49.287 --> 07:51.077
I'm... I'm... I'm going to... hey.
Hey.

07:51.079 --> 07:51.879
OK.

07:55.431 --> 07:56.965
Oh, god.

07:56.967 --> 07:57.668
Here.

07:57.670 --> 08:00.005
Don't bite my toes.

08:00.007 --> 08:00.774
Come on.

08:04.007 --> 08:05.732
What does the snake represent?

08:05.734 --> 08:06.724
Evil.

08:06.726 --> 08:07.556
Yes.

08:07.558 --> 08:08.677
And what else?

08:08.679 --> 08:10.660
A penis?

08:10.662 --> 08:12.452
That's not funny to me.

08:12.454 --> 08:13.316
Pardon me.

08:13.318 --> 08:14.308
Amos.

08:14.310 --> 08:15.556
You have a reply
from the farmer.

08:15.558 --> 08:17.380
Ah, good.

08:17.382 --> 08:18.884
Shall we hear what
the miserable pig

08:18.886 --> 08:20.739
- farmer has to say for himself?
- Yes.

08:20.741 --> 08:21.893
- Yes, please.
- Yes, of course.

08:24.709 --> 08:30.660
Dear Rabbi, I
have followed your...

08:30.662 --> 08:33.253
MOSHE: You read very well, but
please pass it to Benjamin.

08:38.181 --> 08:41.220
I put the pigs on stilts
like Hawaiian bungalows

08:41.222 --> 08:42.499
over the ocean.

08:42.501 --> 08:45.090
Never shall a hoof brush
the earth of the Holy Land,

08:45.092 --> 08:48.035
except of course for
when you buy them from me

08:48.037 --> 08:49.410
to chase off the terrorists.

08:49.412 --> 08:52.514
In the New York Times last
month, I saw a [INAUDIBLE]

08:52.516 --> 08:54.850
soldier with a pig on a leash.

08:54.852 --> 08:57.794
And I must say, it discredits
your tough guy reputation.

08:57.796 --> 08:58.658
MOSHE: OK.

08:58.660 --> 08:59.396
Give it to me.

09:02.051 --> 09:04.033
I am a man who is
respectful of religion,

09:04.035 --> 09:06.338
although I don't
practice it myself.

09:06.340 --> 09:07.873
I didn't mean to
offend you, though you

09:07.875 --> 09:10.081
appear to mean to
offend me by calling

09:10.083 --> 09:12.609
me a degenerate shegetz.

09:12.611 --> 09:13.698
Oh.

09:13.700 --> 09:15.681
MOSHE: Well, I had
to make him react.

09:15.683 --> 09:16.993
Mind you, this will
not change the fact

09:16.995 --> 09:19.521
that Israeli Jews are
gorging themselves on bacon,

09:19.523 --> 09:21.761
and that I am a man who
sells it to them through one

09:21.763 --> 09:23.681
restaurant alone in Tel Aviv.

09:23.683 --> 09:27.232
Eggs and bacon, whether you
like it or not, are on the menu.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.513
They're very popular.

09:28.515 --> 09:31.168
So tell me, Mr. Rabbi,
what exactly is the story

09:31.170 --> 09:32.449
behind the use for pig's blood?

09:32.451 --> 09:34.752
You know, the one in which
bags of porcine blood

09:34.754 --> 09:37.857
were hung in the city buses to
deter terrorists from blowing

09:37.859 --> 09:39.712
themselves up, splashing
themselves with it,

09:39.714 --> 09:43.648
making them impure,
barring them from paradise?

09:43.650 --> 09:46.816
If you can secure me this
contract with public transport,

09:46.818 --> 09:48.640
I won't have to sell
them any more bacon.

09:48.642 --> 09:49.919
I figured that
giving your politics

09:49.921 --> 09:52.352
being so different from
the other rabbis, you know,

09:52.354 --> 09:56.863
your open mindedness and
all, you'd understand me.

09:56.865 --> 10:00.288
As for the road, I will
continue to use it.

10:00.290 --> 10:02.943
You can't prevent me
from practicing my trade.

10:02.945 --> 10:04.031
What do we think of that?

10:04.033 --> 10:07.678
Harry one, Rabbi zero.

10:07.680 --> 10:08.577
Dr. Swimmen.

10:12.448 --> 10:13.312
Dr. Swimmen!

10:16.257 --> 10:17.120
Dr. Swimmen!

10:21.024 --> 10:22.302
Dr. Swimmen!

10:22.304 --> 10:23.645
Wait.

10:23.647 --> 10:24.797
- Annabelle.
- Hi.

10:24.799 --> 10:26.781
I wasn't expecting
you until tomorrow.

10:26.783 --> 10:27.518
I know.

10:27.520 --> 10:28.927
I need to talk to you.

10:28.929 --> 10:29.918
What can I do for you?

10:29.920 --> 10:30.942
I'm kind of in a jam.

10:30.944 --> 10:32.733
I need to cancel
our session tomorrow

10:32.735 --> 10:34.013
because I can't pay you.

10:34.015 --> 10:35.773
But I know that if I
cancel now, I'm still going

10:35.775 --> 10:37.566
to owe you for tomorrow anyway.

10:37.568 --> 10:40.125
And why can't you pay?

10:40.127 --> 10:43.069
My dad, he hasn't transferred
my money in nine weeks.

10:43.071 --> 10:44.797
Your money or his?

10:44.799 --> 10:46.397
Are we on the clock right now?

10:46.399 --> 10:48.157
You're 34 years
old, Annabelle.

10:48.159 --> 10:49.853
I'm also still a student.

10:49.855 --> 10:50.844
Lots of us still are.

10:50.846 --> 10:53.500
You guys left us
a shitty economy.

10:53.502 --> 10:55.644
You know, I've been
thinking of getting

10:55.646 --> 10:57.820
a skateboard to ride to work.

10:57.822 --> 10:59.037
What?

10:59.039 --> 11:01.565
You don't think I could
pull off a skateboard?

11:01.567 --> 11:02.300
No.

11:02.302 --> 11:03.676
You're probably right.

11:03.678 --> 11:05.565
What a ridiculous thought.

11:05.567 --> 11:07.771
I'm too old to pull
off a skateboard.

11:07.773 --> 11:11.835
And you're too old
to have an allowance.

11:11.837 --> 11:14.587
You'll come at 5:00
tomorrow, as per usual.

11:14.589 --> 11:17.339
And once you get that
paycheck from that first job

11:17.341 --> 11:20.731
you're going to start looking
for, you can pay me then.

11:20.733 --> 11:22.523
Now hit that
pavement, Annabelle.

11:22.525 --> 11:23.675
Thank you.

11:23.677 --> 11:25.275
I will, as soon as I
get back from New York.

11:25.277 --> 11:26.428
I'm visiting my mom.

11:26.430 --> 11:28.860
She's paying for the
ticket, by the way.

11:31.293 --> 11:32.093
What's this?

11:35.836 --> 11:41.500
This is the name of an
excellent child psychiatrist.

11:43.932 --> 11:46.394
He has great results
with adolescents

11:46.396 --> 11:48.185
in just your situation.

11:48.187 --> 11:51.065
So can you help me or not?

11:51.067 --> 11:53.499
You've been there for three
hours, for crying out loud.

11:53.501 --> 11:56.697
I tried everything,
your neighbor, Milad, that

11:56.699 --> 11:58.041
grows cows, he will have to...

11:58.043 --> 11:58.873
She raises.

11:58.875 --> 11:59.801
Raises cows.

11:59.803 --> 12:00.921
What?

12:00.923 --> 12:02.841
Raises... I mean,
you don't grow cows.

12:02.843 --> 12:04.122
Listen.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.657
I'm talking English on
top of this telephone pole

12:05.659 --> 12:07.256
with a place full of pigs.

12:07.258 --> 12:08.793
Give me a break with
the grammar lessons.

12:08.795 --> 12:09.722
I'm sorry.

12:09.724 --> 12:10.938
I'm sorry.

12:10.940 --> 12:13.401
So what about this
neighbor that grows cows?

12:13.403 --> 12:16.408
Doesn't want a wire that goes
through a land full of pigs

12:16.410 --> 12:17.240
through his own farm.

12:17.242 --> 12:19.512
These are religious Muslims.

12:19.514 --> 12:21.784
And then the other way,
there is Mrs. Lapierre.

12:21.786 --> 12:25.272
Miss Israel of
'65 or whatever.

12:25.274 --> 12:28.121
She said that Nazareth
belongs to the Christians.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.423
Jesus' land.

12:30.425 --> 12:32.761
But she thinks you're nice.

12:32.763 --> 12:34.168
I know that.
Um.

12:34.170 --> 12:34.999
Yeah.

12:35.001 --> 12:37.143
She comes over to my house.

12:37.145 --> 12:38.551
She wants me to
take her to dinner.

12:38.553 --> 12:41.943
She schleps through the mud here
with these high heeled shoes

12:41.945 --> 12:44.055
just to give me these
baskets of fruit.

12:44.057 --> 12:45.783
She's a fan.

12:45.785 --> 12:47.735
I mean, is there any
other solution, or?

12:47.737 --> 12:49.880
The only solution I
see is to go east where

12:49.882 --> 12:50.904
there's the new settlement.

12:50.906 --> 12:52.727
All the way down there?

Dear dad, Annabelle

the picture she took on 9/11.

That day was the
first day I ever

28:09.806 --> 28:11.117
made love with another man.

28:14.574 --> 28:18.830
And it felt so right and
so wrong at the same time.

It's strange how human beings
confuse the world's stories

If I'm that crazy, then you'd
better hurry up and accept

54:58.659 --> 55:00.256
our offer before you regret it.

55:00.258 --> 55:01.952
Is that a threat?

55:01.954 --> 55:03.264
I'm just a messenger.

55:03.266 --> 55:05.312
God has asked you to leave.

55:05.314 --> 55:07.871
Is he the same
one that notarized

55:07.873 --> 55:10.048
the act to buy my farm?

55:10.050 --> 55:12.512
It's not a farm.

you were OK, where you were.

55:42.368 --> 55:43.552

55:53.216 --> 55:55.709
I wonder why we bury ourselves.

55:55.711 --> 55:59.006
Why do we bury ourselves
when we're still alive, dad?

backwards is kind of stupid.

whole lot of beautiful stories

56:16.733 --> 56:18.077
Beautiful.

56:18.079 --> 56:19.613
They'll be there.

56:24.542 --> 56:25.628
Anyway.

56:25.630 --> 56:27.420

to die, right dad?

56:27.422 --> 56:28.380
No.

56:53.245 --> 56:55.197
You used to come here
to have lunch with me.

I always hoped you'd come one
day to show me your breasts.

57:01.405 --> 57:03.323
And I'm here looking
at your tumor.

57:03.325 --> 57:04.860

the best, can we?

57:35.707 --> 57:36.793
No.

57:36.795 --> 57:38.649
But actually, mine is the best.

57:38.651 --> 57:39.833
I'm sure it is.

57:39.835 --> 57:44.088

the best chiropractor.

such a thing as winter here.

That's really kind of you.

01:06:18.755 --> 01:06:20.897
Some religions, they
ban the eating of pig

01:06:20.899 --> 01:06:22.913

They're very close to us in DNA.

01:06:27.778 --> 01:06:29.825
When that plane
crashed in the Andes,

the other passengers,

01:06:31.681 --> 01:06:34.016
they said it tasted like pork.

If you singe your hair on
your arm, it tastes like pork.

01:06:36.994 --> 01:06:39.359
And pigs themselves will
do anything to survive.

01:06:39.361 --> 01:06:42.112
They'll eat their own garbage,
they'll eat their own shit.

01:06:42.114 --> 01:06:43.231
They'll eat each other.

01:06:43.233 --> 01:06:45.184
We don't need pigs
to remind ourselves

01:06:45.186 --> 01:06:48.798
that we're human, to distinguish
ourselves from beasts.

01:06:55.168 --> 01:06:56.286
What did he say?

01:06:56.288 --> 01:06:59.198
Oh, he said that,
because God said so.

01:07:01.953 --> 01:07:03.327
No.

01:07:03.329 --> 01:07:05.214
It's because Judaism is not
just a religion of faith.

01:07:05.216 --> 01:07:07.136
It's a religion of questioning.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.032

01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:23.361
Hi.

01:28:23.363 --> 01:28:27.586
HARRY [VOICEOVER]: In my
mind, David is married

01:28:27.588 --> 01:28:29.220
to a beautiful blonde woman.

01:28:31.716 --> 01:28:38.722
In my mind, David has a son
and I bounce him on my knee.

01:28:39.682 --> 01:28:41.249
[INAUDIBLE]

01:28:41.251 --> 01:28:46.433
HARRY [VOICEOVER]: In my
mind, David is a doctor.

01:28:46.435 --> 01:28:48.002
And we play chess together.

01:28:48.004 --> 01:28:52.289
I think I know what
makes him tick,

01:28:52.291 --> 01:28:54.690
but he just beats me every time.

01:28:57.187 --> 01:29:01.155
I don't know that deep within,
David is not so simple.

01:29:03.299 --> 01:29:09.185
In my mind, David doesn't
kiss other men on the mouth.

01:29:09.187 --> 01:29:14.624
My mind is full of
tears, regrets, and time

01:29:14.626 --> 01:29:16.642
that's far too short.

01:29:19.586 --> 01:29:20.448
I was angry with you.

01:29:20.450 --> 01:29:23.393
And I'm still angry with you.

01:29:28.354 --> 01:29:32.863
I'm angry with you that my
mother emerged from the camps

01:29:32.865 --> 01:29:35.423
where my father died,
that she carried me

01:29:35.425 --> 01:29:39.839
in the face of horror, that
the sickly infant I was had

01:29:39.841 --> 01:29:43.711
to struggle to survive and
that I then brought you

01:29:43.713 --> 01:29:50.365
into this world so you could
stop everything right here, as

01:29:50.367 --> 01:29:54.302
if you were giving
a reason to death

01:29:54.304 --> 01:30:00.864
itself, to the end of our
family name, to the shadows.

01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:04.478
But who gives a damn, right?

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:10.269
I mean, who cares about
the names, survivors.

01:30:10.271 --> 01:30:11.453
They die too.

01:30:11.455 --> 01:30:16.669
Everything comes to
an end, including me.

01:30:16.671 --> 01:30:17.598
Especially me.

01:30:19.999 --> 01:30:23.516
I'll be there Thursday
for the kaddish,

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:24.797
put the one I loved
into the ground,

01:30:24.799 --> 01:30:27.324
and I'll protect
you and your sister

01:30:27.326 --> 01:30:30.428
and the tallit of a father.

01:30:30.430 --> 01:30:36.252
And soon, all three
of you, because Monica

01:30:36.254 --> 01:30:40.509
isn't with us anymore, but
another has already arrived.

01:30:50.942 --> 01:30:53.243
Forgive me, my son.

01:30:53.245 --> 01:30:54.013
My silences.

01:30:57.341 --> 01:31:00.925
David, they made
the sound of love.

01:31:19.164 --> 01:31:21.436

01:31:56.986 --> 01:32:01.786
[SINGING] Smile though
your heart is aching.

01:32:04.474 --> 01:32:07.418
Smile, even though
it's breaking.

01:32:10.201 --> 01:32:17.017
When there are clouds in
the sky, you'll get by.

01:32:19.641 --> 01:32:26.585
If you smile through your
fear and sorrow, smile,

01:32:28.344 --> 01:32:34.934
and maybe tomorrow,
you'll see the sun

01:32:34.936 --> 01:32:40.920
come shining through for you.

01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:49.718
Light up your face
with gladness.

01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:53.143
Hide every trace of sadness.

01:32:55.704 --> 01:33:02.711
Although a tear may
be ever so near,

01:33:04.375 --> 01:33:10.903
that's the time you
must keep on trying.

01:33:11.863 --> 01:33:13.653
Smile.

01:33:13.655 --> 01:33:18.773
What's the use of crying?

01:33:18.775 --> 01:33:25.750
You'll find that life is still
worthwhile, if you just smile.

01:33:51.253 --> 01:33:57.939
That's the time you
must keep on trying.

01:33:57.941 --> 01:34:03.060
Smile, what's the use of crying?

01:34:05.332 --> 01:34:12.244
You'll find that life is still
worthwhile if you just smile.
