00:02.136 --> 00:03.833
Jenny: I think you have
a tapeworm

00:03.868 --> 00:06.206
that may have caused
cysts in your brain.

00:06.241 --> 00:07.668
<i>It would make sense
on why you're violent.</i>

00:07.703 --> 00:09.371
I mean, this runs
in your family.

00:09.406 --> 00:11.206
- No, it doesn't make sense.
- Yes, it could!

00:11.241 --> 00:12.701
Because it could be from
the wild pigs that you ate,

00:12.736 --> 00:16.074
or it could be in the sausage--
- I'm a vegetarian,

00:16.109 --> 00:17.242
I don't eat sausage,
I don't eat meat!

00:17.277 --> 00:19.074
It's Aaron that had the fits,
it's him. He did this,

00:19.109 --> 00:21.173
and he let you believe
that it was you!

00:21.208 --> 00:23.173
Malik, Cassidy,
Cassidy, Malik.

00:23.208 --> 00:24.307
Hello.

00:24.343 --> 00:27.404
I've been doing this amazing
life coach thing now.

00:27.439 --> 00:29.305
You really do have
a passionate side.

00:29.340 --> 00:31.569
- That surprises you?
- I've missed you.

00:32.670 --> 00:35.140
Idiot!

00:35.175 --> 00:36.437
Jenny, you need
to leave right now.

00:36.472 --> 00:38.371
No, I'm not leaving him
like this!

00:38.406 --> 00:39.205
- Jennifer, please, now. Ow!
- Peggy, stop! I'm just--

00:39.240 --> 00:42.140
- What is this?
- A few nights ago

00:42.175 --> 00:43.241
Gordon was having
a hallucination,

00:43.276 --> 00:45.239
and he thought I was someone
else, and he grabbed me.

00:46.208 --> 00:48.140
My God, what's happening?

00:49.340 --> 00:51.338
You got this?

00:51.373 --> 00:53.338

<i>Power to people.</i>

01:41.703 --> 01:43.800
Bam! Post that!

01:43.835 --> 01:46.272
Yo, what are you dealing
with, Jah? You can't post that.

01:46.307 --> 01:49.338
- Nah, this is who I am.
- Don't walk away!

02:48.241 --> 02:49.833
Hey.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.833
What are you doing out here
so early?

02:55.439 --> 02:56.899
Oh, just...

02:56.934 --> 02:59.239
thinking.

02:59.274 --> 03:01.470
While I still can.

03:10.967 --> 03:12.734
Come on, Detective,
you got this!

03:12.769 --> 03:14.635
Ah! Ow! You know I was
letting you win, right?

03:14.670 --> 03:16.206
I thought you were a legend,
hey?

03:16.241 --> 03:17.767
Yeah, yeah, I was letting
you win.

03:17.802 --> 03:19.866
Ha! This hill kicked
your ass.

03:19.901 --> 03:21.635
Now, let's not forget,
I, I had back surgery like,

03:21.670 --> 03:23.569
a few months ago.
- Yeah, we all got our stuff.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.734
Oh yeah? What trauma
have you endured?

03:25.769 --> 03:27.734
Well, I've seen the inside
of an ER.

03:27.769 --> 03:29.932
Got brought back to life
after I almost drowned.

03:29.967 --> 03:31.998
What? Where?

03:32.033 --> 03:33.965
In the bathtub.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.305
- What? Wh--
- It's nothing.

03:36.340 --> 03:38.338
It- what?

03:40.604 --> 03:42.668
Things weren't good.

03:42.703 --> 03:44.866
I found pills that helped me
feel better.

03:44.901 --> 03:47.437
Helped me wake up,
helped me sleep.

03:47.472 --> 03:48.800
No. When?

03:50.604 --> 03:52.338
Wait.

03:52.373 --> 03:53.767
It doesn't matter, okay?

03:55.703 --> 03:57.932
I'm so sorry you had to go
through that, I had no idea.

03:59.307 --> 04:02.635
You're the first person I've
told, outside my support group.

04:02.670 --> 04:05.371
Well, I'm glad you found
someone to talk to about it,

04:05.406 --> 04:08.272
because we were never good
at talking about things

04:08.307 --> 04:10.305
with each other.
- Yeah.

04:10.340 --> 04:12.767
Opening up isn't something
that comes easy.

04:12.802 --> 04:14.602
It did just now.

04:33.373 --> 04:35.635
Agh.

04:35.670 --> 04:37.536
Hmm. Sorry.

04:40.868 --> 04:42.800
McAvoy.

04:45.373 --> 04:46.734
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

04:46.769 --> 04:47.965
All right, I'll be right there.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.767
Duty calls.

04:49.802 --> 04:51.602
Yeah. I'll make it up to you.

04:51.637 --> 04:53.305
See if you can keep up
next time.

05:09.340 --> 05:11.338
- Hi.
- Dr. Jenny Cooper?

05:11.373 --> 05:12.800
You have to come with me.

05:14.802 --> 05:16.536
Hey, got here as soon
as I could.

05:16.571 --> 05:18.635
It's all good, I've got
the crime scene locked down.

05:18.670 --> 05:20.998
Victim is male,
19, 20 years old,

05:21.033 --> 05:22.899
and well, the legs.

05:22.934 --> 05:24.899
Uh--

05:24.934 --> 05:26.965
are those pieces of a broken
baseball bat?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.602
Yeah, well, it would explain
how his legs got like that.

05:31.505 --> 05:33.338
Damn.

05:33.373 --> 05:34.932
What do you mean
I'm being apprehended

05:34.967 --> 05:36.602
on a material witness warrant?

05:36.637 --> 05:37.899
Where are you taking
my daughter?!

05:37.934 --> 05:39.800
Dad, it's okay.

05:39.835 --> 05:41.701
I didn't get a subpoena.
- Oh, actually, yeah.

05:41.736 --> 05:44.404
No, some stuff did come
while you were up north.

05:44.439 --> 05:45.833
And there was some court
stuff in there.

05:45.868 --> 05:47.767
Okay, it's okay, Dad.
I know. It's okay.

05:47.802 --> 05:49.437
- I signed for it.
- All we know is you failed

05:49.472 --> 05:50.605
show up for court.
- Officer,

05:50.640 --> 05:52.635
my father has dementia,
I cannot leave him here alone.

05:52.670 --> 05:53.899
No, you can, because your
mother's here,

05:53.934 --> 05:56.437
I'm all right.

05:56.472 --> 05:58.965
You know, Dad, let's uh,
let's make a day of it.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.866
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

06:00.901 --> 06:02.800
- Great.
- Come on, sir.

06:17.901 --> 06:20.470
Liam.

06:29.736 --> 06:32.437
Looks like a large ring
was ripped from this finger.

06:32.472 --> 06:35.031
Malik: Hmm.
Robbery gone wrong?

06:35.066 --> 06:37.404
Time will tell.

06:37.439 --> 06:38.932
You find his cell phone?
- No.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.338
Cross U?

06:45.142 --> 06:47.470
Wait, I recognize this kid.

06:49.736 --> 06:51.470
It's... Chisholm--

06:51.505 --> 06:53.734
Uh, Jalil Chisholm, he's been
all over the news lately.

06:53.769 --> 06:55.800
<i>Declared for the draft
after his freshman year.</i>

06:55.835 --> 06:56.701
He was gonna go top ten.

06:59.736 --> 07:01.470
Looks like the car
was rented to Jalil

07:01.505 --> 07:03.470
by "The Gack Agency."

07:03.505 --> 07:05.503
Well, his agent should
be able to get us in touch

07:05.538 --> 07:07.140
with his next of kin.
- Yeah.

07:08.703 --> 07:10.800
Have-have you heard
from Jenny yet?

07:13.066 --> 07:14.866
You're in Courtroom A.

07:16.109 --> 07:17.866
Wait here.

07:19.175 --> 07:21.371
Cheery fellow.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.140
- Dr. Jenny Cooper?
- Hi.

07:24.175 --> 07:26.536
Malou Dan.
Defence attorney.

07:26.571 --> 07:28.031
Thank you for coming out
and uh...

07:28.066 --> 07:30.031
helping with my client's case.

07:30.066 --> 07:31.932
- Helping?
- Aaron Browning.

07:31.967 --> 07:34.140
in Aaron's pre-trial hearing.

07:34.175 --> 07:35.998
You want me to testify
on behalf of the man

07:36.033 --> 07:39.031
who killed my boyfriend?!
- Aaron Browning's not the one

07:39.066 --> 07:41.800
who fatally injured
Liam Bouchard.

07:41.835 --> 07:43.668
- Okay, Dad, we're going.
- You're the one that said

07:43.703 --> 07:45.800
it wasn't Aaron's fault.
- I never said that.

07:45.835 --> 07:47.932
You told Aaron's brother
Caleb that tapeworm cysts

07:47.967 --> 07:49.470
in the frontal lobe
of the brain

07:49.505 --> 07:51.140
can cause violent behaviour.

07:51.175 --> 07:53.701
No, I said that based
on the pathology of his father

07:53.736 --> 07:56.503
and his surrogate sister,
I never diagnosed Aaron.

07:56.538 --> 07:58.470
I only want you to say what
you said to Aaron's brother.

08:08.066 --> 08:09.800
He just ID'd the body.

08:13.241 --> 08:15.668
Thank you for waiting,
Mr. Chisholm.

08:15.703 --> 08:17.899
Detective McAvoy is here
to speak to you about Jalil.

08:20.241 --> 08:22.437
Hi, pleasure to meet you.

08:24.033 --> 08:25.536
Sorry for your loss.

08:27.571 --> 08:30.701
Why can't anybody tell me
what happened to my son?

08:30.736 --> 08:32.470
Trust me, I'm trying
to get you those answers.

08:33.274 --> 08:34.932
But right now I need your help.

08:36.175 --> 08:38.569
Did Jalil tell anybody

08:38.604 --> 08:39.932
where he'd be shooting hoops
last night?

08:42.274 --> 08:44.899
He kept it quiet
that he was home.

08:44.934 --> 08:47.668
Especially since he just
declared for the draft.

08:47.703 --> 08:49.470
Do you know why he came
home suddenly?

08:51.571 --> 08:53.074
He said he wanted to talk
to the family

08:53.109 --> 08:55.503
about some big decision
that he'd made.

08:57.142 --> 08:58.833
But then he...

09:00.175 --> 09:02.206
He didn't get a chance
to tell you what it was.

09:06.604 --> 09:08.569
Here you go, Mr. Chisholm.

09:08.604 --> 09:10.173
Now, you let me know if you
need anything else at all,

09:10.208 --> 09:12.833
all right?
- And you are?

09:12.868 --> 09:14.998
I'm Scott Gack.
I'm Jalil's agent.

09:16.208 --> 09:18.239
I was glad to help put you
in touch with the family.

09:19.637 --> 09:21.635
So talented.

09:21.670 --> 09:23.503
And such a great kid, too.

09:24.901 --> 09:27.734
Did he tell you what his
plans were last night?

09:27.769 --> 09:29.140
No.

09:29.175 --> 09:30.998
We flew up together, but...

09:31.033 --> 09:32.668
I mean, Jalil's been working
so hard,

09:32.703 --> 09:34.272
he's flying all around
meeting team owners,

09:34.307 --> 09:36.272
taking endorsement meetings.

09:36.307 --> 09:38.140
I think he just wanted to,
you know,

09:38.175 --> 09:40.668
to spend some time with his
family, relax a little,

09:40.703 --> 09:42.536
while I took some meetings.
Kingsley: Dad!

09:43.901 --> 09:45.899
<i>Dad! Where's Jah?</i>

09:45.934 --> 09:47.668
Where's Jah?

09:47.703 --> 09:50.701
Tell me my brother's not gone!

09:50.736 --> 09:52.206
Tell me...

10:01.033 --> 10:02.239
I am so sorry, Kingsley.

10:03.736 --> 10:05.602
What's he doing here?

10:05.637 --> 10:07.932
Kingsley, this is not
the time or the place.

10:07.967 --> 10:09.100
We're gonna need to call
a press conference

10:09.135 --> 10:11.272
to announce his passing
before it leaks to the media.

10:11.307 --> 10:13.602
You tore my brother
and me apart.

10:13.637 --> 10:15.536
Look, Kingsley,
this is par for the course.

10:15.571 --> 10:17.206
You weren't equipped
to help your brother

10:17.241 --> 10:19.932
take that next big step.
With what I had planned,

10:19.967 --> 10:21.767
Jalil was about to be set
for life.

10:21.802 --> 10:24.074
You mean you were about
to be set for life.

10:24.109 --> 10:26.031
Okay, calm down.

10:26.066 --> 10:27.965
You think this is what your
brother would've wanted?

10:29.637 --> 10:31.140
You're right. I should go.

10:31.175 --> 10:33.173
I've gotta get ready for
the press conference tonight,

10:33.208 --> 10:34.899
before I fly back out tomorrow.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.899
All right, where will you be
in case we have any questions?

10:36.934 --> 10:38.701
I'm staying at the
Ambassador's Towers.

10:38.736 --> 10:39.965
All right.

10:44.307 --> 10:47.074
I am so sorry for your loss.

10:53.373 --> 10:55.569
He's gone!
He's gone.

11:26.637 --> 11:28.998
Bingo!

11:29.033 --> 11:31.031
Hello? Is someone there?

11:31.066 --> 11:33.767
<i>Young Man: Hello? Jalil?
What happened? You okay?</i>

11:39.868 --> 11:42.305
Hello.

11:45.769 --> 11:48.734
Hey, uh, we've got a call in
to your Mom.

11:50.703 --> 11:52.800
She's an OR nurse, so uh...

11:52.835 --> 11:54.305
you'll be waiting a while.

11:54.340 --> 11:56.701
So uh, Ba-du...

11:56.736 --> 11:58.701
You can just call me Bayley.

11:58.736 --> 12:01.074
Bayley.
Okay, Bayley, so...

12:01.109 --> 12:02.998
why don't you tell us--
- Look, man,

12:03.033 --> 12:04.899
the only reason why I'm here
is 'cause of Jalil Chisholm.

12:04.934 --> 12:06.668
Period.

12:06.703 --> 12:08.998
He reps so hard for the city.

12:09.033 --> 12:10.668
For all of us.

12:10.703 --> 12:12.140
Did you know Jalil
personally?

12:12.175 --> 12:13.998
Sort of. Well...

12:14.033 --> 12:15.338
not personally, personally.

12:15.373 --> 12:17.206
But um, like, online.

12:17.241 --> 12:18.998
What were you doing on the
phone with him last night?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.602
<i>Is something funny?</i>

12:25.934 --> 12:28.173
Oh, I-I didn't mean it
like that.

12:28.208 --> 12:29.668
It wasn't on the phone,
it was on an app.

12:30.868 --> 12:32.635
Ah, every few weeks Jalil hosts

12:32.670 --> 12:34.206
a late night room on Clubzr.

12:34.241 --> 12:36.371
Here you go.

12:36.406 --> 12:38.701
He'd uh, he'd talk to us
about investing,

12:38.736 --> 12:40.932
how to get into different markets,

12:40.967 --> 12:43.107
building generational wealth.

12:43.142 --> 12:44.767
"Young heads, old money,"
he'd say.

12:46.142 --> 12:47.998
Did you hear anything strange

12:48.033 --> 12:49.371
while he was in the room
last night?

12:50.703 --> 12:52.998
Yeah around like, midnight,
12:30,

12:53.033 --> 12:54.899
I heard something like
a scuffle.

12:54.934 --> 12:57.107
But um, everyone was talking
so loud.

12:57.142 --> 12:59.866
And then Jalil kinda
went silent,

12:59.901 --> 13:01.371
and disappeared.

13:01.406 --> 13:03.668
I couldn't really hear
too well, but once he left,

13:03.703 --> 13:05.998
everybody else was gone.
- But you didn't.

13:06.033 --> 13:08.800
Yeah, I mean, I could see
his phone was still connected,

13:08.835 --> 13:10.404
I waited.

13:10.439 --> 13:12.866
I was kinda worried.

13:12.901 --> 13:14.635
But mostly I wanted to talk
to him one-on-one, you know?

13:16.000 --> 13:17.701
And what did you want
to talk to him about?

13:17.736 --> 13:20.107
Oh, dude, blockchains,
assets, drops,

13:20.142 --> 13:23.173
crypto-graphics, Ethereum,
NFTs. Oh, NFTs.

13:23.208 --> 13:25.734
NFTs?

13:27.241 --> 13:29.206
Y'all got screens?

13:29.241 --> 13:31.470
So Jalil was teaching our group

13:31.505 --> 13:34.140
about investing crypto currencies,

13:34.175 --> 13:35.965
and how to trade
in non-fungible tokens.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.833
Non-fungible tokens?

13:37.868 --> 13:40.173
Yeah, so basically NFTs
are like, uh,

13:40.208 --> 13:42.800
digital artwork, videos,

13:42.835 --> 13:44.173
one-of-a-kind music files.
- Hmm.

13:44.208 --> 13:46.272
Like what Jalil was doing

13:46.307 --> 13:48.833
was dealing with digital sports
and collectibles.

13:48.868 --> 13:50.437
Here you go.

13:50.472 --> 13:52.371
We're giving our blood,
sweat, and tears,

13:52.406 --> 13:54.767
pumping millions
into these colleges!

13:54.802 --> 13:57.833
We need to own the rights
to our names and images.

13:57.868 --> 13:59.404
No more free labour.

14:00.901 --> 14:02.998
Only you own you!
- You own you, man.

14:04.274 --> 14:07.866
Over here we got pro-leagues,

14:07.901 --> 14:11.140
making bank selling game
highlights as NFTs.

14:11.175 --> 14:13.173
Okay, so that's kinda like uh,

14:14.901 --> 14:17.833
sports trading cards,
but digital, right?

14:17.868 --> 14:20.239
And you should see the coin
that people are dropping.

14:22.066 --> 14:24.470
Malik: Hmm, it looks like
the sports Dow Jones.

14:24.505 --> 14:26.470
Okay.
- So now...

14:26.505 --> 14:28.998
the professional players negotiated

14:29.033 --> 14:30.734
to get a percentage
out of that,

14:30.769 --> 14:33.338
and Jalil was trying to bring
that to college game.

14:33.373 --> 14:34.932
Hmm.

14:36.274 --> 14:37.866
Woo hoo hoo!
We did it, y'all!

14:37.901 --> 14:39.833
- We hit 100
- K on our network!

14:39.868 --> 14:41.338
We're building this.

14:41.373 --> 14:43.503
Trust me, all right,
ball is not forever,

14:43.538 --> 14:46.107
so we're planning for tomorrow.

14:46.142 --> 14:47.437
The dollars I make minting
my own moments,

14:47.472 --> 14:49.206
we're gonna build up
our communities,

14:49.241 --> 14:50.965
community centres,

14:51.000 --> 14:52.503
<i>housing, land,</i>

14:52.538 --> 14:54.031
our own leagues.

14:54.066 --> 14:56.338
Young heads, old money.

14:56.373 --> 14:59.107
Hashtag TopFamilyInc!

14:59.142 --> 15:00.833
Young heads,
old money.

15:00.868 --> 15:02.503
Bro, rest in peace.

15:02.538 --> 15:04.503
Yeah, I knew his reputation
as a champion baller,

15:04.538 --> 15:06.833
but I had no clue
he had all this going on.

15:06.868 --> 15:10.899
So, now the reason why
Jalil's NFTs were top sellers...

15:13.109 --> 15:15.833
is because, right, he didn't
just do game highlights.

15:15.868 --> 15:18.404
What he did was personal videos.

15:18.439 --> 15:20.503
He does behind-the-scenes
ball shots,

15:20.538 --> 15:24.767
and collaborates with young
up-and-coming artists,

15:24.802 --> 15:26.767
that promotes them
within his community.

15:29.033 --> 15:31.371
What's that one?

15:31.406 --> 15:33.932
♪ Ain't no sunshine
in my slum no play ♪

15:33.967 --> 15:35.272
♪ Don't mind me, man ♪

15:35.307 --> 15:37.272
♪ I'll find my own way,
yeah ♪

15:37.307 --> 15:39.305
I haven't seen
that one before.

15:39.340 --> 15:41.404
Integrity over dollars.

15:41.439 --> 15:43.800
No owners,
because no one owns us.

15:43.835 --> 15:45.437
Wait a second, that's
the outfit Jalil was wearing

15:45.472 --> 15:47.206
the night he died.

15:47.241 --> 15:49.371
Power to people.

15:49.406 --> 15:51.371
Man: ...can't post that.

15:51.406 --> 15:53.371
Yeah, I hear something, it's
like a voice under the music.

15:53.406 --> 15:54.372
All right, let's get
this audio cleaned up.

15:54.407 --> 15:56.305
Whoever recorded this,
whoever's voice that is,

15:56.340 --> 15:58.338
was with Jalil
the night he died.

16:02.175 --> 16:03.833
So what are you gonna do?

16:03.868 --> 16:05.800
I'm gonna say
it's a conflict of interest.

16:05.835 --> 16:07.536
I mean, I can't be
the expert witness

16:07.571 --> 16:10.206
at a preliminary trial
for the man who killed Liam.

16:10.241 --> 16:12.338
No, that's a very good point.

16:12.373 --> 16:14.437
You know what you gotta do,

16:14.472 --> 16:16.206
you gotta tell your friend
the Crown Attorney over here,

16:16.241 --> 16:17.338
and he'll let us go right now.

16:17.373 --> 16:19.371
- Hey, Jenny.
- Hey.

16:19.406 --> 16:21.833
What are you doing here?

16:21.868 --> 16:23.404
Ah! Living an actual nightmare.

16:24.538 --> 16:26.305
Oh damn.

16:27.868 --> 16:29.470
- Are you--
- I'm opposing counsel

16:29.505 --> 16:30.899
for the Crown in the case
of Aaron Browning.

16:30.934 --> 16:32.470
Why didn't you tell me?

16:32.505 --> 16:34.173
They just called me in
to assist with the pre-trial.

16:34.208 --> 16:35.371
I didn't know they called you.

16:35.406 --> 16:37.437
I mean, they can't do this,
can they?

16:37.472 --> 16:39.305
It's a conflict of interest.
- Malou Dan wouldn't have

16:39.340 --> 16:41.206
had you here if she didn't
think she could use you.

16:41.241 --> 16:43.305
I made a hypothetical
diagnosis that she's saying

16:43.340 --> 16:45.404
could exonerate Aaron, and I--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:45.439 --> 16:46.866
I can't speak to you
about this, Jenny.

16:50.033 --> 16:51.333
I'm sorry you're in
this position.

16:51.368 --> 16:53.602
Please, you've gotta tell me,
I can get out of this, can't I?

16:53.637 --> 16:55.272
I'm sorry, there isn't.

16:55.307 --> 16:57.371
But I'll be in there with you,
okay?

16:58.571 --> 17:01.074
Yeah.

17:05.142 --> 17:07.536
Hey Dad, I'm-I'm just gonna
go out and get soma air, okay?

17:07.571 --> 17:09.272
Good idea,
here, take this.

17:10.472 --> 17:12.272
Thank you.

17:14.538 --> 17:16.272
Who's that, again?

17:17.571 --> 17:19.503
It's Liam's mom.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.305
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

17:23.637 --> 17:26.041
- I'll be right back.
- Good girl.

17:28.604 --> 17:30.404
- Hey, I got the--
- Sh-Sh-Sh! Shh!

17:30.439 --> 17:33.140
He's trying to trace
Jalil's last NFT.

17:33.175 --> 17:36.074
Okay, I got the Tech Desk
to clean up the audio on it.

17:38.637 --> 17:41.272
<i>Man: Yo, what are you dealing
with, Jah, you can't post that!</i>

17:41.307 --> 17:43.206
<i>Jalil: Nah, this is who I am!</i>

17:43.241 --> 17:45.404
<i>Don't walk away!</i>

17:45.439 --> 17:48.404
Jalil's brother calls him
"Jah."

17:48.439 --> 17:51.338
And that sounds exactly
like his voice.

17:51.373 --> 17:53.305
So you think that Jalil
was killed by his own brother?

17:55.439 --> 17:57.140
I'll tell you what I do know,
I know that Kingsley

17:57.175 --> 17:58.932
was with Jalil the night
he died,

17:58.967 --> 18:00.503
and he didn't bother
to mention it.

18:05.967 --> 18:07.503
Jenny!
Bonjour.

18:07.538 --> 18:09.272
Hi.

18:10.571 --> 18:13.206
Mm! It's nice to see you.

18:13.241 --> 18:14.899
It's nice to see you, too.

18:16.340 --> 18:18.272
Is uh, is Rene parking the car?

18:18.307 --> 18:20.305
Rene had a stroke,

18:20.340 --> 18:21.932
he's in a hospital in Montreal.

18:21.967 --> 18:23.668
Oh my God, Elodie,
I'm so sorry.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.173
Yeah, losing Liam was
too much for his health.

18:26.208 --> 18:29.536
But I'm here to make sure
that monster stands trial

18:29.571 --> 18:32.404
for what he did to our son.

18:32.439 --> 18:34.998
I-I know it won't be easy
for you to tell the court

18:35.033 --> 18:36.635
what that man did to Liam,

18:36.670 --> 18:39.305
but if it helps put him
away for good...

18:39.340 --> 18:41.371
hmm, I'm grateful you're here.

18:43.241 --> 18:44.899
Um...

18:46.241 --> 18:48.371
Elodie, I'm-I am actually here
on behalf of the defence.

18:51.241 --> 18:53.173
No, I-I know, it's just--
I, um,

18:53.208 --> 18:54.965
before Liam died,
I had this,

18:55.000 --> 18:56.701
I had this theory that
the person...

18:56.736 --> 18:58.470
the person who killed the
family was being influenced

18:58.505 --> 19:00.668
by these brain cysts,
and now they want me--

19:00.703 --> 19:03.569
Jenny!
My only child is dead.

19:03.604 --> 19:07.107
My husband suffered a stroke
from the grief,

19:07.142 --> 19:09.569
and you're standing in the way
of the only thing

19:09.604 --> 19:12.404
that might bring some peace
in our lives?!

19:13.637 --> 19:15.404
Elodie, I'm sorry.

19:25.307 --> 19:27.371
Why didn't you mention that
you were with Jalil last night?

19:29.373 --> 19:31.074
I didn't want the cops
to assume I did something

19:31.109 --> 19:33.206
I didn't do.

19:33.241 --> 19:35.041
If you didn't,
then why would we?

19:39.274 --> 19:41.107
We had a beef a while back.

19:41.142 --> 19:43.305
It was all over the socials.

19:43.340 --> 19:45.173
We squashed it,
deleted all the posts,

19:45.208 --> 19:47.338
but you know how it is.
It's already out there.

19:47.373 --> 19:49.173
What were you fighting about?

19:49.208 --> 19:50.701
I was on my way
to the nationals

19:50.736 --> 19:53.305
when I shattered my knee
in my senior year.

19:53.340 --> 19:54.932
This would've been my career.

19:56.142 --> 19:58.239
But I invested everything
into my brother.

19:58.274 --> 20:00.602
So I took what I knew,
and-and became his rep,

20:00.637 --> 20:02.701
mentoring and advising him.

20:02.736 --> 20:05.031
Me and my bro built a platform,

20:05.066 --> 20:07.140
Top Family Inc.,

20:07.175 --> 20:09.371
to support Jalil's career.

20:11.439 --> 20:13.602
But right when it looked like
he could be ready

20:13.637 --> 20:17.206
to declare for the draft,
that snake agent showed up.

20:17.241 --> 20:18.998
Scott Gack.

20:21.340 --> 20:23.272
Money people care about money,
not family.

20:25.703 --> 20:28.031
So what happened when you
saw Jalil last night?

20:35.340 --> 20:37.635
We linked up,
played some ball.

20:39.109 --> 20:41.031
He asked me to record
something of him,

20:41.066 --> 20:43.404
and that's when he dunked
the statue head.

20:43.439 --> 20:45.536
Malik: That's when
the altercation began?

20:45.571 --> 20:48.272
I didn't want him to throw
it all away making waves.

20:49.703 --> 20:52.338
Calling out the owners
who were about to draft him.

20:52.373 --> 20:53.734
I don't-I don't disagree
with him,

20:56.835 --> 20:59.206
but make a statement,
be a hero...

21:01.241 --> 21:03.569
after you get paid, you know?

21:04.769 --> 21:06.470
But you minted the NFT
of the statue head dunk.

21:07.670 --> 21:09.404
Got it sold.

21:09.439 --> 21:11.338
I did it to help my parents
pay for some of the debt.

21:12.538 --> 21:15.031
Okay, they borrowed a lot
to help Jalil make it.

21:15.066 --> 21:17.371
No, I get it, you feel like
you're building a partnership

21:17.406 --> 21:20.701
with someone
and they evolve, they...

21:20.736 --> 21:22.272
they don't need you anymore,
they think they know better.

21:23.571 --> 21:25.239
You were your brother's
right hand.

21:25.274 --> 21:27.635
Then along came Scott Gack.

21:27.670 --> 21:29.536
He leased Jah a new whip,

21:31.109 --> 21:32.767
flew him First Class
to meet the top owners,

21:32.802 --> 21:35.272
up in his ear about leaving
school to turn pro.

21:38.208 --> 21:40.107
We were Top Family Inc.

21:42.439 --> 21:43.569
That was going to be
my future, too.

21:47.505 --> 21:49.437
You said you blew out
your knee in high school?

21:54.175 --> 21:56.239
I want to talk to my father.

21:56.274 --> 21:57.767
And a lawyer.

22:29.670 --> 22:31.470
Dennis: The cops were asking
about a missing ring

22:31.505 --> 22:33.371
caught on his clothing?

22:33.406 --> 22:35.635
There's nothing
in his personal effects.

22:35.670 --> 22:37.272
Both knees are shattered.

22:37.307 --> 22:39.305
Both tibias and fibulas, too.

22:39.340 --> 22:41.470
If he survived this attack,
I don't think he'd ever

22:41.505 --> 22:43.272
be able to play elite
sports again.

22:43.307 --> 22:45.305
He got Nancy Kerrigan'd.

22:45.340 --> 22:46.701
Yeah, Nancy Kerrigan
didn't die.

22:46.736 --> 22:48.833
There's very little blood loss.

22:48.868 --> 22:50.668
No extensive bleeding.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.800
Definitely not enough
to warrant loss of life.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.338
You don't think the attack
was fatal.

23:05.175 --> 23:06.899
Hey, Dad, you okay?

23:06.934 --> 23:08.899
You need anything to eat?

23:08.934 --> 23:10.734
Why am I here today?

23:11.901 --> 23:14.701
Like, why?

23:14.736 --> 23:16.569
You're here for moral
support, Dad.

23:16.604 --> 23:18.239
No, I don't think so,
you've never asked me

23:18.274 --> 23:20.536
to come to your work
before this, never.

23:20.571 --> 23:22.635
As a matter of fact,
I was banned from the...

23:22.670 --> 23:23.899
middle school soccer games,

23:23.934 --> 23:26.536
because I cheered too loud.

23:26.571 --> 23:28.404
No, I'll tell you why I'm here.

23:28.439 --> 23:30.503
Because you're afraid.

23:30.538 --> 23:32.536
You're afraid to leave me
at home with Peggy.

23:32.571 --> 23:34.272
No, Dad, I'm not afraid,
it's just...

23:35.505 --> 23:37.272
look, we just have
to figure this out.

23:37.307 --> 23:39.272
Figure out what?
You can't figure this out.

23:40.967 --> 23:43.701
My grip on reality is going.

23:45.967 --> 23:48.173
And it's just going
to be worse.

23:51.340 --> 23:53.272
There's no happy ending for me.

23:54.439 --> 23:55.866
I feel like I am creating
the situation

23:55.901 --> 23:58.734
that I fear most in this world,

23:58.769 --> 24:00.701
that I'm gonna lose my...

24:03.868 --> 24:06.173
Hey.

24:06.208 --> 24:08.470
Dad, you are not going
to lose your family.

24:08.505 --> 24:10.701
Malou: Dr. Cooper,
we're ready for you.

24:29.340 --> 24:31.404
The scale must be broken.

24:31.439 --> 24:33.602
I calibrated it yesterday.

24:33.637 --> 24:36.305
545.9 grams is off the chart.

24:37.637 --> 24:40.371
It is a heavy heart.

24:40.406 --> 24:42.437
Please don't let this be
the segue.

24:42.472 --> 24:44.305
You know we never
finished talking

24:44.340 --> 24:45.899
about moving to Port Hope.

24:47.868 --> 24:50.371
Dennis, I get that your mom
is your community,

24:50.406 --> 24:51.833
but I've literally
never met her.

24:51.868 --> 24:53.635
Yeah, I know!

24:53.670 --> 24:55.272
Despite my best attempts,

24:55.307 --> 24:57.635
you always find a reason
to not meet her.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.800
Do you want to meet her?

24:59.835 --> 25:02.272
Eli: I've been fielding calls
from the press all day.

25:02.307 --> 25:03.800
Trying to find out
what happened

25:03.835 --> 25:05.635
to the superstar freshman
from Toronto.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.635
Hello! Someone died here.

25:07.670 --> 25:09.701
It's not about who gets
the headline first.

25:09.736 --> 25:11.800
Find anything?

25:11.835 --> 25:13.800
His heart is twice the size
it should be.

25:13.835 --> 25:15.536
Even for an athlete
of this size.

25:15.571 --> 25:17.371
Hmm.

25:19.340 --> 25:21.371
The left ventricle
looks enlarged.

25:21.406 --> 25:23.272
He has no fatal injuries
related to the attack.

25:24.637 --> 25:26.866
Myocarditis?

25:26.901 --> 25:28.371
Jalil died of a heart attack?

25:29.571 --> 25:31.404
Possibly triggered
by the stress

25:31.439 --> 25:33.404
of being brutally attacked.

25:33.439 --> 25:35.635
You have a cause
for the inflammation?

25:35.670 --> 25:37.536
His father said he had
no underlying conditions,

25:37.571 --> 25:39.371
nothing genetic.

25:39.406 --> 25:41.404
Okay, so heart attacks
in healthy,

25:41.439 --> 25:43.470
20-year-old athletes...

25:43.505 --> 25:45.536
rare, but it has been known
to happen.

25:46.769 --> 25:49.437
Most often in cases where
performance-enhancing drugs

25:49.472 --> 25:51.767
caused an overload in the
heart's electrical system.

25:53.604 --> 25:55.470
Tox screen's in.

25:55.505 --> 25:57.569
I had them to check for
performance-enhancing drugs

25:57.604 --> 25:59.404
just in case.
- Ah.

25:59.439 --> 26:01.701
What's the verdict?
Human growth hormone?

26:01.736 --> 26:03.470
Steroids?

26:03.505 --> 26:05.503
High levels of amphetamines.

26:14.802 --> 26:16.668
'Til my lawyer shows up,
I don't have nothing to say.

26:16.703 --> 26:18.767
Yeah, your brother had
sky-high levels of amphetamines

26:18.802 --> 26:19.998
in his system.

26:20.033 --> 26:21.998
Amphetamines don't help
in basketball,

26:22.033 --> 26:24.031
and Jah didn't need to take
anything to boost his game.

26:24.066 --> 26:26.437
They got in his system somehow.

26:26.472 --> 26:27.965
Do you have the name
of his doctor?

26:28.000 --> 26:30.338
Nah, Scott handled all that.

26:30.373 --> 26:32.635
Got him a new sports clinic
over in the Beaches.

26:33.835 --> 26:35.470
All right, thanks.

26:52.373 --> 26:53.998
Please state your name.

26:54.033 --> 26:56.305
Dr. Jenny Cooper, Coroner.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.800
Yes, Dr. Cooper,

27:01.835 --> 27:03.866
the Coroner for Ontario West.

27:03.901 --> 27:06.074
About a year ago,
you were involved in a case

27:06.109 --> 27:09.668
where you explored the idea
that tapeworm cysts

27:09.703 --> 27:12.734
in a person's brain can
affect their behaviour?

27:12.769 --> 27:14.569
I'm sorry, but I don't feel
comfortable talking

27:14.604 --> 27:16.635
about Aaron Browning when
I haven't seen his imagery,

27:16.670 --> 27:19.371
nor have I diagnosed him myself.

27:19.406 --> 27:21.107
That wasn't my question.

27:21.142 --> 27:23.701
My question is,
can tapeworm cysts

27:23.736 --> 27:26.503
in a person's brain
affect their behaviour?

27:26.538 --> 27:28.965
Yes, they can,
but it's less about the cyst,

27:29.000 --> 27:30.734
and it's more about
where they're located.

27:30.769 --> 27:32.866
Would you tell the court
what the pre-frontal cortex

27:32.901 --> 27:35.371
is responsible for?

27:36.505 --> 27:37.866
The pre-frontal cortex
is responsible

27:37.901 --> 27:39.965
for executive functions,

27:40.000 --> 27:42.602
like controlling reflexive behaviours.

27:42.637 --> 27:45.074
A person can have blunted
emotional responses,

27:45.109 --> 27:48.404
become aggressive if the
pre-frontal cortex is affected

27:48.439 --> 27:50.800
by degeneration
or abnormalities?

27:50.835 --> 27:52.437
- Yes.
- Like cysts?

27:53.439 --> 27:55.031
Yes, like cysts.

27:55.066 --> 27:56.866
And they can become violent?

28:06.472 --> 28:08.569
Dr. Cooper,

28:08.604 --> 28:10.404
and they can become violent?

28:12.175 --> 28:15.569
Yes, in some cases
they can become violent.

28:16.769 --> 28:18.767
Is this image similar
to what you're talking about?

28:21.505 --> 28:23.031
Yeah.

28:23.066 --> 28:24.470
Let it state for the record

28:24.505 --> 28:26.602
that I'm entering in a CT Scan
in evidence.

28:26.637 --> 28:28.404
Dr. Cooper.

28:28.439 --> 28:31.074
Dr. Cooper, can you please
read the name

28:31.109 --> 28:33.371
at the top of that CT scan?

28:48.571 --> 28:50.734
It's...

28:50.769 --> 28:52.140
it's Aaron Browning.

28:52.175 --> 28:54.074
Then wouldn't it follow
that Aaron Browning,

28:54.109 --> 28:56.074
due to his medical condition,
would not be responsible

28:56.109 --> 28:57.899
for anything he might have done

28:57.934 --> 29:00.173
that led to the death
of Liam Bouchard?

29:01.571 --> 29:03.107
Well--

29:03.142 --> 29:04.536
As you can see from
Dr. Cooper's testimony,

29:04.571 --> 29:06.140
none of the evidence

29:06.175 --> 29:07.833
the Crown has presented here
today is relevant,

29:07.868 --> 29:10.107
because Aaron Browning is not
responsible for his behaviour.

29:10.142 --> 29:12.767
I move for the case
to be dismissed.

29:12.802 --> 29:14.140
Thank you, Dr. Cooper.

29:35.802 --> 29:37.140
It was a mess,

29:37.175 --> 29:39.833
we were in the first wave
of COVID,

29:39.868 --> 29:41.602
colleges were still forcing
their athletes to play.

29:42.802 --> 29:45.668
Are you saying Jalil Chisholm
had COVID-19?

29:45.703 --> 29:47.470
He came to our clinic
after he tested positive.

29:47.505 --> 29:49.074
His agent sent him.

29:49.109 --> 29:50.042
But there's no record
of this.

29:50.077 --> 29:52.800
He was asymptomatic,
so the school looked

29:52.835 --> 29:54.734
the other way until they
finished their run.

29:54.769 --> 29:56.668
He could've infected
the whole team,

29:56.703 --> 29:58.437
the whole tournament!
- Probably wasn't just him.

29:58.472 --> 30:00.602
A lot of schools weren't
taking it seriously back then.

30:00.637 --> 30:02.668
They thought young athletes
were too strong to go down.

30:04.208 --> 30:06.239
All right, so you're
a private clinic here.

30:06.274 --> 30:08.437
So what was your treatment
plan for Jalil?

30:09.538 --> 30:11.074
When Jalil came to me,

30:11.109 --> 30:12.866
he'd started experiencing
chest pains,

30:12.901 --> 30:14.206
trouble breathing, exhaustion.

30:14.241 --> 30:16.107
All right,
so what'd you give him?

30:16.142 --> 30:17.965
A little something to perk
him up, right?

30:18.000 --> 30:19.833
Stimulant patches
to increase his stamina.

30:19.868 --> 30:21.833
He was flying out for workouts
with pro teams,

30:21.868 --> 30:23.998
he didn't want them to know
he was still recovering.

30:24.033 --> 30:25.998
We thought
if we got him through

30:26.033 --> 30:27.866
that little rough patch,
his body would heal.

30:27.901 --> 30:29.701
But it didn't.

30:32.066 --> 30:34.569
We didn't know then that
a person could be asymptomatic

30:34.604 --> 30:37.899
while the virus was shredding
their body.

30:37.934 --> 30:40.140
By the time he got an ECG--

30:40.175 --> 30:42.470
You knew he had myocarditis
from COVID-19?

30:45.000 --> 30:47.107
- Only in the last few days.
- You had to have known

30:47.142 --> 30:49.173
he'd never pass a pro-team's
physical.

30:49.208 --> 30:52.239
By the end, yes,
I knew he was undraftable.

30:52.274 --> 30:54.107
And I'm sure he did, too.

31:00.967 --> 31:02.866
Hey, "ball isn't forever, bro."

31:02.901 --> 31:05.074
We heard Jalil say that himself.

31:05.109 --> 31:06.899
Okay, so he knew his career
was ending.

31:06.934 --> 31:08.899
<i>Which is probably why
he started putting out NFTs.</i>

31:08.934 --> 31:11.503
Try and support himself and his
family while he still could.

31:11.538 --> 31:14.173
We also need to open an
investigation into that clinic.

31:14.208 --> 31:17.107
Mm-hmm. Okay.

31:17.142 --> 31:19.107
Detective Abed!
You gotta see this!

31:19.142 --> 31:20.503
Hey, Bayley's got something,
okay?

31:22.538 --> 31:24.800
So news just leaked
of Jalil's passing,

31:24.835 --> 31:27.866
and a bunch of never-seen
before NFTs just dropped!

31:27.901 --> 31:29.140
Hey Mac, check this.

31:29.175 --> 31:31.031
All the prices are skyrocketing.

31:31.066 --> 31:33.173
It's $25, $30,000.

31:33.208 --> 31:35.272
Okay, am I reading
this right?

31:35.307 --> 31:36.998
Are all these NFTs being sold
by the same account?

31:38.901 --> 31:40.701
One person's making
a fortune off Jalil's death.

31:40.736 --> 31:42.173
That's motive.
- All right,

31:42.208 --> 31:44.173
let's get the Tech Team to
trace the seller's location.

31:44.208 --> 31:45.965
I'm already on it.
He's rerouting right now.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.965
Come on, come on, come on!

31:50.033 --> 31:51.767
Yes, sir!
Okay, okay!

31:51.802 --> 31:53.899
He's at Bay and Collins.

31:53.934 --> 31:55.536
The Ambassador's Towers.

31:55.571 --> 31:57.173
Scott Gack's staying
at that hotel.

31:57.208 --> 31:59.173
All right, let's get units
in the area

31:59.208 --> 32:01.173
to hold him at the hotel
'til we get there.

32:01.208 --> 32:02.866
I'll go get a warrant.
- Yep.

32:04.934 --> 32:06.272
Hey, Jalil would be proud
of you, Bayley.

32:07.967 --> 32:09.569
- Thank you.
- Yeah, man.

32:10.769 --> 32:12.107
Thanks, man.

32:23.670 --> 32:25.932
Dr. Cooper, how long were you
and Liam Bouchard together?

32:27.934 --> 32:29.107
Two and a half years.

32:29.142 --> 32:31.107
And were you in love
with him?

32:31.142 --> 32:33.074
Yes.

32:33.109 --> 32:34.701
And are you still in love
with him?

32:38.208 --> 32:40.173
Yes. Yes.

32:43.066 --> 32:44.866
Do you think you're in
a place where you can speak

32:44.901 --> 32:46.635
professionally about
Aaron Browning's case

32:46.670 --> 32:48.173
when it affects you
so personally?

32:48.208 --> 32:49.833
I mean, you yourself suffer
from mental health issues,

32:49.868 --> 32:51.635
and anxiety.

32:52.868 --> 32:54.305
I don't see how
that's relevant here.

32:54.340 --> 32:56.074
Has it affected your work
professionally?

32:56.109 --> 32:57.998
- No, it hasn't.
- Dr. Cooper,

32:58.033 --> 32:59.701
where have you been
for the last four months?

33:06.670 --> 33:08.305
I've been on sabbatical.

33:08.340 --> 33:10.668
Can you tell us why?

33:10.703 --> 33:12.239
Is it because you couldn't
properly do your job

33:12.274 --> 33:14.305
while grieving for
Liam Bouchard?

33:14.340 --> 33:15.833
I couldn't do my job
because I was afraid

33:15.868 --> 33:17.239
that I would lose everybody
that I love.

33:17.274 --> 33:19.239
And do you still feel
that way?

33:23.274 --> 33:25.206
Sometimes.

33:25.241 --> 33:26.635
So should you be
in this situation?

33:26.670 --> 33:28.899
To decide, unbiased,
whether or not this man

33:28.934 --> 33:30.866
should stand trial?

33:38.000 --> 33:40.031
The man I loved died.

33:40.066 --> 33:42.899
And yes, there are days that
I wish that Aaron Browning

33:42.934 --> 33:44.899
would rot in a cell
for the rest of his life.

33:44.934 --> 33:47.635
But I am trying to separate
the man and the illness,

33:47.670 --> 33:49.734
and it is hard.

33:49.769 --> 33:51.932
I mean, could you do it if
the woman that you loved died?

33:55.033 --> 33:56.734
- No, I couldn't.
- No.

33:58.241 --> 34:00.899
But I can say professionally

34:00.934 --> 34:03.173
that more research has to be
done into Aaron Browning,

34:03.208 --> 34:05.272
we need to find out whether
or not these cysts existed

34:05.307 --> 34:07.140
at the times of the murder, and...

34:09.307 --> 34:11.107
and if they did,

34:16.109 --> 34:18.239
then he should go to an
institution, and not prison.

34:36.472 --> 34:39.305
Hey, got word. Gack checked
out 20 minutes ago.

34:39.340 --> 34:41.107
All our cars are looking
for his rentals,

34:41.142 --> 34:43.107
and they're thinking that
he's headed for the airport.

34:43.142 --> 34:44.701
Damn, he's trying to get
out of town.

34:44.736 --> 34:46.107
Hold up.

34:48.802 --> 34:51.074
Change of plans.

35:01.703 --> 35:03.206
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

35:19.802 --> 35:21.998
- What happened?
- Unit spotted him,

35:22.033 --> 35:23.767
Gack tried to lose him,
and flipped the car.

35:23.802 --> 35:25.734
It looks like he was thrown
from the vehicle.

35:25.769 --> 35:27.767
Probably died on impact.

35:27.802 --> 35:29.767
What a mess.

35:44.175 --> 35:46.800
It's Jalil's championship ring.

36:00.066 --> 36:01.767
You did good in there,
I thought.

36:01.802 --> 36:03.239
Yeah, thanks, Dad.

36:04.505 --> 36:06.272
Very good.

36:08.472 --> 36:10.272
You know, I heard
what you said today.

36:12.033 --> 36:13.371
And I'm not gonna get you
another PSW.

36:16.307 --> 36:18.305
I'm gonna try harder
with Peggy.

36:19.505 --> 36:21.404
But I'm gonna make sure
that you know

36:21.439 --> 36:23.371
you're not gonna lose
your family.

36:25.439 --> 36:27.173
Thanks.

36:34.472 --> 36:36.338
The verdict came in.

36:38.373 --> 36:40.338
The judge ruled that
there's enough evidence

36:40.373 --> 36:42.734
for Aaron Browning
to stand trial.

36:44.066 --> 36:46.041
And they might have to do
more research as well.

36:50.439 --> 36:52.866
That's all I wanted, Elodie.

36:52.901 --> 36:56.173
Jenny, hearing you speak
for Aaron in court,

36:58.439 --> 37:01.305
you have compassion
for people who struggle

37:01.340 --> 37:03.404
with these sorts of things.

37:03.439 --> 37:06.140
That's why you were the right
partner for Liam.

37:07.505 --> 37:10.173
I couldn't ask for any more
for my son.

37:10.208 --> 37:12.206
Forgive me.

37:27.033 --> 37:29.031
I'm sorry.

37:29.066 --> 37:30.932
Not now.

37:30.967 --> 37:32.569
Gordon: Come on.
- Not now.

37:32.604 --> 37:34.866
Let's go home.

38:02.538 --> 38:04.536
Your parents said
we could find you here.

38:04.571 --> 38:06.404
Yeah, "Hoops for Jalil."

38:06.439 --> 38:08.140
Some of our boys
put it together.

38:10.033 --> 38:12.107
It was Scott Gack
who killed my brother?

38:12.142 --> 38:13.866
Yeah, we think he hired
some people,

38:13.901 --> 38:15.932
but we're on it.
We're gonna find them.

38:15.967 --> 38:17.602
I don't understand,
why would he--

38:17.637 --> 38:19.305
Why would he do this?

38:19.340 --> 38:21.305
He invested a lot of money
in your brother.

38:21.340 --> 38:24.305
And Jalil retiring would have
cost him, but uh,

38:24.340 --> 38:26.272
a young superstar who endured
a vicious assault,

38:26.307 --> 38:28.899
that's a scandal
he could cash in on.

38:28.934 --> 38:30.932
We don't think he intended
on killing your brother,

38:30.967 --> 38:32.899
he probably didn't realize

38:32.934 --> 38:34.965
that Jalil's heart
couldn't take it.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.173
But what he did lead
to your brother's death.

38:40.505 --> 38:42.536
I'd like you to meet someone.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.140
- Hey, man.
- This is Bayley.

38:46.175 --> 38:48.074
He helped us with
your brother's case,

38:48.109 --> 38:49.503
and he's got something
for you from Jalil.

38:50.901 --> 38:53.107
So this is an unreleased NFT.

38:53.142 --> 38:55.602
It's one of one,
it's minted.

38:55.637 --> 38:57.635
But he didn't sell it.

38:57.670 --> 39:00.140
It's his most valuable,
and uh...

39:01.340 --> 39:03.305
he said it's for you.

39:08.142 --> 39:10.338
All right, you got this?
All right?

39:10.373 --> 39:12.470
Jah, you got this.
- Yeah.

39:14.142 --> 39:16.140
Go on, buck up!

39:17.472 --> 39:19.470
Whoa, you did it, man!
- Yeah, I did it!

39:19.505 --> 39:21.206
Let's go, you did it!

39:21.241 --> 39:23.031
No, see, I told you
you could do it, bro.

39:23.066 --> 39:24.833
I told you, bro.

39:29.637 --> 39:31.437
We always said we were doing
this together.

39:34.406 --> 39:35.602
Even though it felt like
he was leaving me behind,

39:37.703 --> 39:40.173
I was proud of him.

39:41.373 --> 39:43.135
He wasn't afraid
to take a risk,

39:46.208 --> 39:47.866
to say what he had to say.
