Larry:
Hello? Mr. Porter?

00:41.631 --> 00:44.005
(blues song plays softly
in background)

00:44.089 --> 00:46.005
Are you Chulu Porter?

00:46.089 --> 00:47.839
-Who are you?
-Um...

00:47.964 --> 00:51.255
My name is Larry David,
and I've been looking
all over for you.

00:51.339 --> 00:54.214
-Oh. Come on in.
-Thank you.

00:54.297 --> 00:56.297
-Have a seat.
-Um...

00:57.631 --> 00:58.964
So...

00:59.631 --> 01:03.381
You were the pastry chef
at the Waldorf Astoria
in New York. Were you not?

01:03.464 --> 01:05.381
It's been a while,
long time ago.

01:05.464 --> 01:07.589
What a hotel. I mean,
there were a couple
of problems,

01:07.673 --> 01:11.381
like the air conditioning
was... not great, I have to say.

01:11.464 --> 01:14.005
I like a cold room, Chulu,
you know, 64 degrees.

01:14.089 --> 01:16.631
-Mm-hmm.
-And the tub was too small.
But besides that,

01:16.714 --> 01:18.881
what I loved about it was,
every morning,

01:18.964 --> 01:21.172
I'd go downstairs
to the restaurant,

01:21.255 --> 01:23.547
and I'd have a cup of coffee,

01:23.631 --> 01:25.547
and a scone.

01:25.839 --> 01:29.130
-And those scones were
the best scones I've ever had...
-(Chulu chuckles)

01:29.214 --> 01:31.172
...anywhere in my--
I've never forgotten them.

01:31.255 --> 01:33.172
Well, I was known
for my scones.

01:33.255 --> 01:36.005
Anyway, I'm opening up
a coffee shop, and...

01:36.673 --> 01:38.631
I need you to make me
those scones.

01:38.714 --> 01:41.047
I'm sorry, I haven't
touched a whisk...

01:41.130 --> 01:42.381
20 years.

01:42.464 --> 01:46.047
See, Chulu,
the thing is,
there's this man.

01:46.130 --> 01:48.339
He's got this coffee place.
He's...

01:48.422 --> 01:50.589
kicked me out of it.
He's banned me from it.

01:50.673 --> 01:53.005
And I opened up a place
next door to his.

01:53.089 --> 01:55.297
I've sworn revenge,
and with your help,

01:55.381 --> 01:57.089
maybe I can get it.

01:57.172 --> 01:59.756
-Oh, a spite store.
-Spite store, right.

01:59.839 --> 02:01.964
Well, what's this
guy's name, anyway?

02:02.047 --> 02:05.339
-(spaghetti western music plays)
-He goes by the name of...

02:05.964 --> 02:07.422
Mocha Joe.

Did you say Mocha Joe?

02:10.172 --> 02:11.255

Pretty... pretty...

02:37.756 --> 02:40.089
pretty, pretty good.

02:41.047 --> 02:42.881
Yeah, I was just trying
to stop her from leaving,

02:42.964 --> 02:45.381
-so as I grabbed her wrist--
-Sure, Larry, but I think--

02:45.464 --> 02:47.714
I think we're beyond
the details of what happened
at this point,

02:47.798 --> 02:49.798
because her attitude
has completely changed.

02:49.881 --> 02:51.547
Alice and her attorneys
are out for blood,

02:51.631 --> 02:54.923
and I think the priority now
is keeping this from
going public.

02:55.005 --> 02:57.631
You know, you have, uh,
Seinfeld  syndication,

02:57.714 --> 02:59.005
you have the Hulu deal.

02:59.089 --> 03:01.422
You don't want headlines
about you being sued

03:01.506 --> 03:03.214
for sexual harassment
by a former assistant.

03:03.297 --> 03:06.005
Side-sitting,
I can't believe
what it did to me.

03:06.089 --> 03:07.464
I think, unfortunately,
we're in a different

03:07.547 --> 03:09.255
category now,
settlement-wise.

03:09.339 --> 03:12.339
But, uh, in your case,
I think it's eminently worth it

03:12.422 --> 03:15.964
for the value to you
of having this thing
over with

03:16.047 --> 03:18.923
and not lying around
to be discovered by the public.

03:20.172 --> 03:22.798
What?
Get the fuck outta here!

03:22.881 --> 03:24.881
-Are you kidding? What?
-Roger: Well, that's not it--

03:24.964 --> 03:26.172
That money is not for her.

03:26.255 --> 03:28.798
It's for a charity called
Survivors United,

03:28.881 --> 03:30.964
devoted to victims
of sexual harassment.

03:31.047 --> 03:33.798
-Alice's charity of choice.
-Yeah, my, my cousin Andy's wife

03:33.881 --> 03:36.047
is involved with that.
Cassie. Yeah.
-Roger: That's great,

03:36.130 --> 03:39.089
because in addition
to the financial remuneration,

03:39.172 --> 03:41.839
they would like you to,
uh, make a speech.

03:41.923 --> 03:44.714
They want me to make a speech?
What am I supposed to say?

03:44.798 --> 03:48.172
I think she wants you to,
in a public way,

03:48.255 --> 03:51.297
show contrition and show
that this has moved
you a step forward,

03:51.381 --> 03:53.339
that you've evolved as
a result of this experience.

03:53.422 --> 03:55.881
I'm gonna call Alice's attorneys
immediately to let her know

03:55.964 --> 03:58.172
-that you're on board with this.
-(crunches)

03:58.255 --> 04:00.339
What are you doing?

04:01.047 --> 04:03.172
-I think I'm eating an apple.
-Okay.

04:03.255 --> 04:04.714
I'm worried you're not
taking this seriously.

04:04.798 --> 04:06.214
You're blithely
eating an apple here.

04:06.297 --> 04:07.714
-We're really talking about--
-"Blithely eating"--

04:07.798 --> 04:09.339
There's no other way
to eat an apple but blithely.

04:09.422 --> 04:11.214
-Yeah, but I need you--
-That's how apples are eaten.

04:11.297 --> 04:13.464
I think you're
incorrect about that.
My dad ate angry apples

04:13.547 --> 04:14.839
-all the time.
-Larry: An angry apple?

04:14.923 --> 04:16.589
He communicated a tremendous
amount of hostility--

04:16.673 --> 04:18.589
-Cannot eat an apple angry.
It's impossible.
-In fact, I think

04:18.673 --> 04:20.756
there are a lot of
emotional colors available
when eating an apple.

04:20.839 --> 04:22.631
-Not just blitheness.
-Well, I completely
disagree with you.

04:22.714 --> 04:24.673
I'm concerned you're not
taking this seriously.

04:25.005 --> 04:27.881
I'm, I'm taking it seriously!
I'm gonna pay a shitload
of money,

04:27.964 --> 04:29.881
and I'm gonna make
a fuckin' speech

04:29.964 --> 04:31.673
about something
I-I know nothing about.

04:31.756 --> 04:34.422
Those aren't even apples
for eating, anyway.
They're decorative.

04:34.506 --> 04:36.130
Decorative?
What, are you kidding?

04:36.214 --> 04:38.005
What? I've never
heard of that in my life.
Why don't you get

04:38.089 --> 04:39.673
-the artificial fruit?
-You never heard of
decorative apples?

04:39.756 --> 04:41.381
Yes, and they're artificial.

04:41.464 --> 04:43.673
I never heard of anybody
using real fruit

04:43.756 --> 04:45.297
as, for decoration purposes.

04:45.381 --> 04:47.839
Larry, I'd feel better
if we just stopped
the eating for now,

04:47.923 --> 04:50.714
just long enough to get
a few basic points down

04:50.798 --> 04:53.756
-for the speech.
Okay. No eating.
-Okay. No worries.

04:53.839 --> 04:55.798
-(apple thuds)
-I'll put the apple away.

04:55.881 --> 04:57.756
-Just... Yeah.
-What?

04:57.839 --> 05:00.381
Now I have a half-eaten apple
in my, uh, basket, here.

05:00.464 --> 05:02.422
(stammers) Where are
you supposed to put it?

05:02.506 --> 05:03.923
It's a garbage--
It's a garbage can.

05:04.005 --> 05:06.464
Larry, it's not a garbage can.
That's a, that's...

05:06.547 --> 05:08.464
It's an unlined receptacle

05:08.547 --> 05:11.089
-that's sitting next to a desk.
-Yes, for garbage!

05:11.172 --> 05:12.422
It's for paper.
It's not a lined garbage can.

05:12.506 --> 05:13.881
How am I supposed to know
it's for paper?

05:13.964 --> 05:16.130
If I see a garbage can,
I throw garbage in there.

05:16.214 --> 05:17.839
I think you're conflating
garbage with paper.

05:17.923 --> 05:20.547
-I mean, it's, really,
it's for paper, it's not...
-Yeah.

05:20.631 --> 05:21.714
This is the oddest office.

05:21.798 --> 05:22.923
You have fruit
that's not for eating,

05:23.005 --> 05:24.464
you have garbage
that's not for garbage,

05:24.547 --> 05:26.339
and you have a bathroom

-You did?
Why didn't you tell me?
-Yeah, I did.

08:31.172 --> 08:32.964
Uh, you know,
I give to a lot of charities.

08:33.047 --> 08:34.881

you know. I just...

-It's really sweet.
-Well, you know,
you were

08:37.089 --> 08:38.673
connected with it,

08:38.756 --> 08:40.506
it would be a nice,
uh, gesture, you know.

Ah, yeah.

16:27.381 --> 16:29.130
Stir it up real good.

16:29.214 --> 16:31.839
Put a little tea,
a little bit of
lemonade together.

16:31.923 --> 16:33.464
-Mm-hmm.
-Hello, Arnold Palmer.

16:33.547 --> 16:36.422
-Congratulations.
-That motherfucker
got away with that shit.

16:36.506 --> 16:39.214
-Yeah, I didn't think he was
the first one to do it.
-Fuckin' right.

16:39.297 --> 16:42.130
You know how many times
I fuckin' put milk and
Mountain Dew together?

16:42.214 --> 16:43.464
You know what I mean?
I could have had my own--

16:43.547 --> 16:45.297
my own fuckin' drink,
the Leon Black.

16:45.381 --> 16:47.589
Milk and Mountain Dew?
Disgusting.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.547
There's certain taste buds
that you motherfuckers like.

16:49.631 --> 16:52.089
But you get away with that shit.
I don't know how the fuck
you get away with it.

16:52.172 --> 16:54.839
When you say
"you motherfuckers," you're
referring to white people?

16:54.923 --> 16:56.255
Of course I am.
You motherfuckers

16:56.339 --> 16:58.089
will accept all kind of
stupid shit in your mouth.

16:58.172 --> 17:02.172
-Oh, is that so? Oh.
-Escargots, and, and,
and fuckin' wheat grass.

17:02.255 --> 17:04.089
Who the fuck drinks
fuckin' grass?

17:04.172 --> 17:07.464
-Oh, okay, okay. I-I must--
-What kind of motherfucker,
cutting your grass?

17:07.547 --> 17:10.089
And what about, um,
chitlins?

17:10.172 --> 17:12.547
-Humph. (sniffs)
-And pigs' knuckles?

17:12.631 --> 17:15.923
-Hmm.
-And pigs' brains
and pigs' feet?

17:16.005 --> 17:17.964
Anything to do with the pig.

17:18.047 --> 17:20.381
-Huh?
-Touché, motherfucker.

17:20.464 --> 17:22.005
-Touché.
-Motherfucker.

17:22.089 --> 17:23.673
Right there.
Hey, man.

17:23.756 --> 17:26.005
(chuckles) Shit.
What the fuck is that?

17:26.089 --> 17:29.005
I hope your speech is better
than that goddamned doodle
right there.

17:29.631 --> 17:31.005
Hey, fuckface,

17:31.089 --> 17:33.547
you really shouldn't be
insulting a doodle.
It's a doodle.

17:33.631 --> 17:36.506
It's just horrible.
Are you fuckin'
kidding me, man?

17:37.839 --> 17:38.923
Whoo!

17:39.005 --> 17:40.547
(chomps, groans)

17:40.631 --> 17:44.381
-(screams)
-What the fuck?
That's artificial fruit!

17:44.839 --> 17:47.130
-(lisping):
Is my tooth chipped?
-It's chipped!

17:47.214 --> 17:49.172
-(lisping): Is my tooth chipped?
-Yes! You chipped it!

17:49.255 --> 17:52.881
-What the fuck, Larry?
-What, what are you eating
artificial fruit for?

17:52.964 --> 17:54.381
Who the fuck puts
artificial fruit on the table?

17:54.464 --> 17:56.381
I don't know.
I saw it at Jeff's house.
I liked it.

17:56.464 --> 17:59.214
You put the shit on the table,
in the fucking kitchen!

17:59.297 --> 18:01.214
What the fuck else
am I gonna do with it?

18:01.297 --> 18:03.339
-I don't know.
You couldn't tell?
-No! You should put

18:03.422 --> 18:05.464
that shit somewhere else,
like the living room
or somewhere

18:05.547 --> 18:07.631
where nobody's gonna
fuckin' eat it!

18:07.714 --> 18:10.964
My tooth is chipped.

18:11.047 --> 18:12.714
Sorry.

18:14.506 --> 18:17.005
(patrons chatting)

18:17.089 --> 18:20.255
How do you serve eggs
without toast?
It's unbelievable.

18:20.339 --> 18:22.089
Some people are allergic
to toast.

18:22.172 --> 18:24.714
Is that an answer?
What is that?

18:24.798 --> 18:27.172
-(chuckles)
It's, it's imbecilic.
-Are some people--

18:27.255 --> 18:28.881
Why is it imbecilic?

18:28.964 --> 18:31.297
Well, everybody,
you can't serve the eggs
without the toast.

18:31.381 --> 18:32.798
-Yes--
-They're a team.

18:32.881 --> 18:35.422
You know, you are
like a president
in the 18th century

18:35.506 --> 18:39.589
on the back of a train,
saying, "And there will
always be toast!"

18:39.673 --> 18:41.631
-(Larry chuckling)
-"With eggs!

18:41.714 --> 18:44.089
And two turkeys
in every garage!"

18:44.172 --> 18:47.631
Stop lecturing the world
on your point of view.

18:47.714 --> 18:48.964
Ah. Excuse me.

18:49.047 --> 18:50.631
Oh. Yes, sir.

18:50.714 --> 18:53.798
Um, there's no toast
with the eggs.

18:53.881 --> 18:56.339
Lo siento.
Our cocinero  Cecilio
must have forgotten.

18:56.422 --> 18:58.673
-All right. All right.
Thank you very much.
-Lo siento.

18:58.756 --> 19:01.130
-You're driving him nuts, man.
-What is this?

19:01.214 --> 19:03.923
-What is what?
-The sweater.
You're wearing the sweater?

19:04.005 --> 19:05.547
-It's a gift.
-I told you before,

19:05.631 --> 19:08.005
I didn't want to see it anymore.
It has painful memories for me.

19:08.089 --> 19:10.130
-So take it off.
-What kind of gift is that?

19:10.214 --> 19:13.130
(stammers) I'll wear
whatever I want.
It's mine now.

19:13.214 --> 19:15.130
-This is selfish.
It's very selfish.
-How can it be selfish?

19:15.214 --> 19:16.881
-You gave me an espresso
machine from Rome.
-Okay. Yeah?

19:16.964 --> 19:18.798
-I'm gonna throw it out?
-Okay, take off that sweater.

19:18.881 --> 19:20.798
-I'm not takin' it off.
It's mine.
-I want you to take--

19:20.881 --> 19:22.798
-I want you to take off
that fuckin' sweater.
-Hey, are you out of your--

19:22.881 --> 19:24.339
Hey, get the fuck, hey--

19:24.422 --> 19:26.464
Get out of here!
Hey, stop.

19:26.547 --> 19:29.714
-(indistinct muttering)
No. Don't touch me!
-Oh. Oh!

19:29.798 --> 19:33.130
Um, yeah.
Thank you.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.339
-Here's your toast.
-Larry: Thank you.

19:35.422 --> 19:36.881
And, uh, Señor Lewis.

19:36.964 --> 19:38.798
-Oh, yes.
-The check.
Thank you so much.

19:38.881 --> 19:41.089
-What? What are
you talking about?
-As always. Thank you, really.

19:41.172 --> 19:44.339
-It means a lot. Thank you.
-No, no, no, no.
I gave Francisco my credit card.

19:44.422 --> 19:46.964
Francisco is not here.
He is mourning the death
of his aunt,

19:47.047 --> 19:48.673
Concepción Zarzal.

19:49.089 --> 19:51.005
Richard:
God bless you,
and God bless him,

19:51.089 --> 19:53.255
and his aunt, and...
Generous tip, by the way.

19:53.339 --> 19:55.756
-Oh, yes. Thank you.
-As usual. Am I right,
or am I wrong?

20:00.339 --> 20:02.381
-Larry: Ah!
-Larry David.

20:02.464 --> 20:04.339
Well, well.
Hello, Laverne!

20:04.422 --> 20:07.339
It's so good to meet you.
I have a cold.

20:07.422 --> 20:09.297
-You have a cold.
-I don't want to get you sick.

20:09.381 --> 20:11.881
You have--
That is so considerate
of you.

20:11.964 --> 20:14.047
Thank you so much.
You know what?

20:14.130 --> 20:15.714
-Most people don't do that.
-(coughs, clears throat)

20:15.798 --> 20:18.339
-They keep it to themselves.
-I like to think...

20:18.422 --> 20:21.506
what would I want someone to do
if I were on the other side.

20:21.589 --> 20:23.714
And I want someone to tell me,
and I want them to protect me.

20:23.798 --> 20:26.506
-You know what you're doing?
You're golden-ruling it.
-I'm golden-ruling it.

20:26.589 --> 20:28.255
You're golden-ruling it,
Laverne.

20:28.339 --> 20:31.339
You know, Larry,
I just wanted to take
this moment to say

20:31.422 --> 20:33.631
how grateful I am
for you to be here.

20:33.714 --> 20:36.547
I think it's so important
that straight white men,

20:36.631 --> 20:38.255
particularly in your age group,

20:38.339 --> 20:40.214
be part of the movement.

20:40.297 --> 20:44.130
And I think you, Larry,
are gonna be a role model
to so many people.

20:44.214 --> 20:46.422
-And you'll be introducing me?
-Absolutely.

20:46.506 --> 20:48.964
Do you know what
you're gonna say yet?
I have a couple of ideas.

20:49.047 --> 20:52.881
-Oh, yeah. What?
-I think you can introduce me
sort of as a, uh...

20:52.964 --> 20:54.172
as a Renaissance man.

20:54.255 --> 20:56.714
-Oh!
-You know, a guy who...

20:56.798 --> 20:58.422
speaks six languages.

20:58.506 --> 21:00.798
You speak six languages, Larry?
Oh, my God.

21:00.881 --> 21:03.422
-That's amazing.
-No, I, I only speak
one language.

21:03.506 --> 21:05.589
Yeah, I know a little bit
of Yiddish.

21:05.673 --> 21:07.756
Vo den? Vos machstu.

21:07.839 --> 21:09.547
What a meshugganah.

21:09.631 --> 21:12.589
(speaks Yiddish)
You know, a couple things
I picked up from my parents.

21:12.673 --> 21:16.756
So you want me to get onstage
at a charity and lie?

21:16.839 --> 21:19.130
No, you just say these things.
It'll, it will impress them.

21:19.214 --> 21:21.756
You wanna impress people
with lies?

21:21.839 --> 21:23.714
Well, how else do you
impress them?

21:24.172 --> 21:26.130
Larry, I, I--

21:26.214 --> 21:27.881
First of all, I don't lie.

21:27.964 --> 21:30.506
So much of this event
is about being in the truth.

21:30.589 --> 21:33.005
All right. You know what?
Introduce me any way you'd like.
How about that?

21:33.089 --> 21:35.798
-Okay.
-By the way, you know,
I have a, uh, I have a friend.

21:35.881 --> 21:38.214
Marty Funkhouser,
his daughter...

21:38.297 --> 21:41.130
is transitioning to be a man.

21:41.214 --> 21:43.881
-That's beautiful.
That's so beautiful.
-Yeah.

21:43.964 --> 21:47.756
Can I ask you a question about
the whole transitioning thing?

21:47.839 --> 21:50.297
-Okay.
-Okay, like,
I'm an organ donor,

21:50.381 --> 21:53.506
and on my driver's license,
it says I'm an organ donor.

21:53.589 --> 21:55.547
Can you, can you donate

21:55.631 --> 21:59.005
a-a penis to a person
who's transitioning?

21:59.714 --> 22:02.422
-'Cause that's not--
-You...

22:02.506 --> 22:05.631
How about this one?
Could a white transitioner

22:05.714 --> 22:07.631
get a black penis?

22:07.714 --> 22:09.464
Okay. I-I think I got it.

22:09.547 --> 22:12.631
I think I understand.
All righty, Larry. It was...

22:12.714 --> 22:14.756
great to...
great to meet you.

22:14.839 --> 22:18.005
-Okay. See you out there.
-(whispers): Okay.

22:21.297 --> 22:23.839
Larry, how are you?

22:23.923 --> 22:26.255
How about this, huh?
Nice event, huh?

22:26.714 --> 22:29.214
Wha-- wha--
What the hell is this?

22:29.297 --> 22:30.547
What?

22:30.631 --> 22:32.506
-This sweater. Wh--
What are you doing?
-I know.

22:32.589 --> 22:34.547
-Isn't it nice?
-Okay. Take it off.

22:34.631 --> 22:35.881
Okay?
I want you to take it off.

22:35.964 --> 22:37.047
What are you talking about?

22:37.130 --> 22:38.923
I don't want you
to wear that sweater.

22:39.005 --> 22:41.589
-Why?
-'Cause Cheryl gave it to me.
I gave mine to Richard,

22:41.673 --> 22:43.255
'cause I didn't wanna be
reminded of it,

22:43.339 --> 22:44.673
and now you're
reminding me of it.

22:44.756 --> 22:46.798
-I'm not taking this off.
-Take it off.

22:46.881 --> 22:48.589
-It goes with
all my pants, it's great.
-Cassie: Yes. Sexy.

22:48.673 --> 22:50.297
-Take it off.
-What are you--
Get out of here!

22:50.381 --> 22:53.255
Larry, stop it.
He's got like a polo shirt
on under this.

22:53.339 --> 22:55.673
-Yeah, I got a golf shirt.
I can't take this off.
-We're at an event!

22:55.756 --> 22:57.923
Okay, anyway,
can we talk about
something important?

22:58.005 --> 23:01.005
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay. I'd like to talk
to you about this.

23:01.089 --> 23:02.798
Okay.
What about it?

23:02.881 --> 23:05.589
This is the doodle
you give me for charity?

23:05.673 --> 23:07.881
-Yeah.
-It's terrible, Larry.

23:07.964 --> 23:10.839
-We can't use this.
-Larry: You said it doesn't
matter what it looks like.

23:10.923 --> 23:12.839
-It's a doodle.
-No. This is a doodle.

23:12.923 --> 23:14.631
-This is Christine Lahti's.
-That's a doodle?

23:14.714 --> 23:16.214
-Cassie: That's a doodle.
-Andy: This is beautiful.

23:16.297 --> 23:18.506
Larry: That is not a doodle.
That is a work of art, okay?

23:18.589 --> 23:20.130
-You know what?
-This is gonna get
so much money.

23:20.214 --> 23:21.923
-So much money.
This, what? A nickel?
-This is--

23:22.005 --> 23:23.381
-Honest to God--
-I'll give you two pence.

23:23.464 --> 23:24.673
You're not holding it
the right way.

23:24.756 --> 23:26.255
-You hold it like this. Okay?
-Oh, oh!

23:26.339 --> 23:27.714
That's so much better.
Let's get it framed!

23:27.798 --> 23:29.130
Yeah, you know,
it could be anything.

23:29.214 --> 23:30.881
Could be a roller coaster.
It could be a shoe.

23:30.964 --> 23:33.130
It could be a large intestine.
You gotta think a little bit.

23:33.214 --> 23:35.798
Oh, I'm think-- You know
what it is? It's what you find
in a large intestine.

23:35.881 --> 23:37.923
-That's what that is.
-Andy: Oh, my gosh. Wow.

23:38.005 --> 23:39.714
-It's a piece of shit. It is!
-Okay, yeah?

23:39.798 --> 23:42.214
It is, honestly, that's
what I think of it, okay?

23:42.297 --> 23:44.381
Because we can't sell it.
We can't do anything with it.

23:44.464 --> 23:46.005
I gotta hang this up.

23:46.714 --> 23:48.130
-See this?
-Larry: Oh, oh.

23:48.214 --> 23:49.631
-You're throwing
it in there?
-Whoops!

23:49.714 --> 23:51.839
-Oh, now it's a garbage can.
-Yeah, and that's garbage.

23:51.923 --> 23:54.005
-So thank you.
-Oh, yeah, thank you.

23:55.381 --> 23:58.673
(lively chatter)

24:04.130 --> 24:05.923
Larry:
Christine.

24:06.005 --> 24:08.130
-Yes.
-Hey. Larry David.

24:08.214 --> 24:09.714
-Hey, Larry.
How are you?
-Hi.

24:09.798 --> 24:12.798
-I'm good.
-Good. I'm kind of surprised
to see you here.

24:12.881 --> 24:15.089
-Oh, yeah? Why's that?
-Um, I don't know. I mean,

24:15.172 --> 24:16.839
you're known for other things.

24:16.923 --> 24:20.047
Not your activism,
or your advocacy for women.

24:20.130 --> 24:23.255
No, I've spent
a good deal of my life
advocating for women.

24:23.339 --> 24:26.547
-Well, I didn't know that.
-And, and, and pursuing them.

24:26.631 --> 24:29.297
-Right. Purs--
Right. Okay. Yeah.
-Yes.

24:29.381 --> 24:33.381
That's advocacy in a way,
in that I'm pursuing them,
I want them.

24:33.464 --> 24:36.714
-I'm advocating for them
by pursuing them.
-Right. Okay.

24:36.798 --> 24:40.464
Especially if, uh,
sex resulted from it,
that would be fine.

24:40.547 --> 24:42.130
That's not exactly
what I meant.

24:42.214 --> 24:44.381
But, you know,
it's a cause that
I really believe in,

24:44.464 --> 24:46.547
and I'm really passionate
about, so I'm just...

24:46.631 --> 24:48.673
-happy to hear
that you are, too.
-Oh, yes. Of course.

24:48.756 --> 24:51.130
But anyway, um, so,
did you do a doodle?

24:51.214 --> 24:53.381
-Did you-- I didn't--
-Uh, yes, I did.

24:53.464 --> 24:55.714
-I didn't, I didn't-- Oh.
-No, it's not on the wall.

24:55.798 --> 24:58.297
It's not on the wall.
I noticed your doodle
is on the wall.

24:58.381 --> 24:59.798
-Yes. Yes.
-Yeah.

24:59.881 --> 25:02.964
-Do you like it?
-I like it. I think
it's very well done.

25:03.047 --> 25:05.130
-How long did it
take you to do that?
-I mean, maybe,

25:05.214 --> 25:07.172
I don't know, 20 minutes,
half, half an hour.

25:07.547 --> 25:09.839
-Half an hour?
-I didn't, I don't--
I didn't time it.

25:09.923 --> 25:12.297
Yeah, but that's not a doodle.
That is not a doodle.

25:12.381 --> 25:14.506
-It's a doodle.
They're all doodles.
-No, it's not a doodle.

25:14.589 --> 25:16.506
That's a p--
Yeah, this is like
the Louvre, this place.

25:16.589 --> 25:18.506
-I mean, come on.
I, I-- You know what?
-Christine: Yes.

25:18.589 --> 25:21.297
-What was yours like?
-It was open to interpretation.

25:21.381 --> 25:23.589
-Oh, abstract.
-That's the beauty
of a doodle.

25:23.673 --> 25:24.714
You don't know
what it is.

25:24.798 --> 25:26.798
Okay. Did you put
any effort into it?

25:26.881 --> 25:29.047
I put the same amount of effort
I put into the doodle

25:29.130 --> 25:31.047
as I would if I was
talking on the phone
doodling.

25:31.130 --> 25:33.214
-Which is to say, none.
-Larry, Larry.

25:33.297 --> 25:34.839
if you don't put
effort into it,

25:34.923 --> 25:36.839
it just smacks of,
I'm sorry to say this,

25:36.923 --> 25:39.297
it smacks of kind of
a white male privilege.

25:39.381 --> 25:41.506
You know, that you don't
have to put any effort
into anything,

25:41.589 --> 25:44.005
you could get away
with anything, because
you're a white man. Right?

25:44.089 --> 25:45.756
Oh, that's just...
That's just nonsense.

25:45.839 --> 25:47.381
Well, then,
why didn't you
put effort into it?

25:47.464 --> 25:49.047
I'm the only one
who followed instructions

25:49.130 --> 25:50.506
out of everybody on this wall.

25:50.589 --> 25:52.047
-There's no doodles here.
-I think--

25:52.130 --> 25:54.547
-They're all doodles, in fact.
-None of them are doodles.

25:54.631 --> 25:57.381
Passionate doodles,
because we care
about this cause,

25:57.464 --> 25:59.172
-and you don't.
-Oh, I don't care
about the cause?

25:59.255 --> 26:01.089
-No, I don't think you do.
-Oh, I don't? I don't, huh?

26:01.172 --> 26:02.881
-What is that?
-What is that, a doodle?

26:02.964 --> 26:06.506
That's a speech
that I'll be giving that
you'll be listening to

26:06.589 --> 26:08.297
-and apologizing to me later...
-I don't think so.

26:08.381 --> 26:09.964
-...for ever talking
to me like this. Okay?
-I don't think so.

26:10.047 --> 26:11.798
-Who wrote that?
Your assistant?
-I wrote it.

26:11.881 --> 26:13.547
And it took a lot
less time than it took

26:13.631 --> 26:15.547
-for you to do that painting.
I can tell you that.
-Well, yeah--

26:15.631 --> 26:18.381
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen,
Laverne Cox.

26:18.464 --> 26:21.464
(cheering)

26:22.506 --> 26:24.130
Woo!

26:25.214 --> 26:26.673
Laverne:
Good afternoon.

26:26.756 --> 26:30.047
My name is Laverne Cox,
and I am so honored
to be here

26:30.130 --> 26:32.381
with each and every one of you,

26:32.464 --> 26:36.589
and to welcome you
on behalf of Survivors United.

26:36.673 --> 26:38.547
Now I know these events
can be triggering,

26:38.631 --> 26:42.047
but I want to remind you
that you are more
than your pain.

26:42.130 --> 26:46.964
I want to remind you
that you are more than
what happened to you.

26:50.756 --> 26:52.172
Our first speaker.

26:52.255 --> 26:54.714
We know them as the cocreator

26:54.798 --> 26:57.631
of the legendary sitcom
Seinfeld.

26:57.714 --> 27:01.673
Please join me in welcoming
Larry David.

27:02.339 --> 27:05.005
-(cheering)
-Oh, this is so nice of you.

27:05.089 --> 27:08.005
Well, thank you.
Thank you so much.

27:08.714 --> 27:10.339
Ah, stop it.

27:14.381 --> 27:17.798
Oh, no. To you. To you.
You're the heroes.

27:17.881 --> 27:19.130
You're the heroes.

27:19.214 --> 27:21.381
(cheering continues)

27:23.172 --> 27:24.547
-Whoa!
-(audience gasps)

27:24.631 --> 27:26.798
(audience booing)

27:26.881 --> 27:29.506
-Asshole!
-What are you doing?

27:29.589 --> 27:31.214
-No, she has a cold!
-(booing)

27:31.297 --> 27:33.673
-Alice: What is wrong with you?
-She has a cold!

27:33.756 --> 27:37.297
-You're such a disgrace!
Why would you even come here?
-(angry booing)

27:37.381 --> 27:39.547
-She has--
-Alice: Honestly,
what is wrong with you?

27:39.631 --> 27:41.964
-Tell 'em you have a cold!
-Alice: Asshole!

27:42.047 --> 27:44.047
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-You need to go home!

27:44.130 --> 27:45.881
-(thudding)
-Hey! Hey!

27:45.964 --> 27:47.130
Alice: My God!

27:47.214 --> 27:49.381
-(angry shouting)
-Alice: What the hell?

27:49.464 --> 27:50.881
Larry:
Hey! Hey!

27:51.255 --> 27:54.547
(angry shouting continues)

27:56.172 --> 27:58.506
Well, what was
I supposed to do?
She had a cold.

27:58.589 --> 28:00.339
-She had a cold?
She had a cold.
-Larry: Yeah.

28:00.422 --> 28:01.964
What if she didn't have a cold?

28:02.047 --> 28:03.255
Ah, well...

28:03.339 --> 28:05.172
You're supposed to kiss her.
It's a social nicety.

28:05.255 --> 28:06.839
No, I, you know--
I, I--

28:06.923 --> 28:09.589
All right, well now we gotta
walk this back, I mean,
the optics, Larry.

28:09.673 --> 28:12.464
The optics were terrible.
This was the way out,
do you understand that?

28:12.547 --> 28:15.464
-This, this was, this was
supposed to be the olive branch.
-Okay.

28:15.547 --> 28:17.923
Okay, okay. I'll, I'll...

28:18.005 --> 28:20.756
make out with Laverne Cox
on national television.

28:20.839 --> 28:22.506
We'll-- I'll have a make-out
session with her.

28:22.589 --> 28:26.089
No, forget that.
How about a,
a, a, a nice hug.

28:26.172 --> 28:27.547
I'll give her a hug.

28:27.631 --> 28:29.381
-All right, we'll spitball.
-You know.

28:29.464 --> 28:31.839
-But let me set up
the meeting, okay?
-Slow dance with her.

28:31.923 --> 28:33.631
-A slow dance.
-Okay. Okay.

28:33.714 --> 28:35.255
But more of
an old-fashioned dance.

28:35.339 --> 28:36.506
-Not, not, you know--
-I, I, I--

28:36.589 --> 28:38.798
Don't, don't come up
with any more ideas.

28:38.881 --> 28:41.422
Okay? Our problem is
that Alice does not feel

28:41.506 --> 28:44.089
that what happened was
a good-faith fulfillment
of the agreement.

28:44.172 --> 28:46.506
Alice, Alice, Alice, Alice.

28:46.589 --> 28:48.589
Oh, I am so sick of this woman!

28:48.673 --> 28:50.464
-Roger: So she is now seeking--
-I'm so sick of her!

28:50.547 --> 28:52.714
She is now seeking
a personal settlement,

28:52.798 --> 28:54.798
on top of the original donation
and speech.

28:54.881 --> 28:56.714
I felt sorry for her.
That's why I hired--

28:56.798 --> 28:58.297
What are you doing?
You're writing down again?

28:58.381 --> 29:00.089
Are you kidding?

29:00.506 --> 29:02.214
Oh, get the fuck outta here!

29:02.297 --> 29:05.631
-That's insane!
-Well, that's the price
of buying back your legacy,

29:05.714 --> 29:07.047
my friend.
That's where we are.

29:07.130 --> 29:08.464
Wait, wait. I got an idea.
Remem--

29:08.547 --> 29:11.589
Remember that old, uh,
John Lennon, Yoko Ono album

29:11.673 --> 29:14.714
where they're in bed together?
The bed-in? Whatever that was?
-Yeah.

29:14.798 --> 29:17.089
I'll be in bed with Laverne Cox.

29:17.172 --> 29:18.589
Some kind--
We get a picture.

29:18.673 --> 29:19.923
-Okay. How about this?
-You know?

29:20.005 --> 29:21.964
I think there is one last
glimmer of hope,

29:22.047 --> 29:23.673
if we're lucky enough
to execute it.

29:23.756 --> 29:26.923
And that is to sit down
face-to-face, one last time,

29:27.005 --> 29:29.089
if they will have it,
with Alice and her attorneys,

29:29.172 --> 29:32.422
and explain that what happened
was a legitimate
misunderstanding.

29:32.506 --> 29:35.673
You know what? I think
you should put me on
the phone with that attorney.

29:35.756 --> 29:37.589
Black women really like me.

29:37.673 --> 29:40.631
Let me set up the meeting,
and then we'll go from there.

29:40.714 --> 29:43.673
-You okay with that?
-Yeah. I mean, sure.

29:43.756 --> 29:45.172
Roger:
Good.

29:45.673 --> 29:47.047
Oh, have an apple.

29:47.339 --> 29:49.005
-What?
-Yeah.

29:49.255 --> 29:53.130
-Maybe I overreacted
last time. Have one.
-Wow.

29:53.547 --> 29:55.464
Very proud of you!

29:55.547 --> 29:57.631
You are making progress.

29:57.923 --> 30:00.464
-Aah. Larry-- No, no!
-(cracks)

30:00.547 --> 30:02.506
Larry: Oh! Oh!
(spitting)

30:02.589 --> 30:05.047
-What the fuck?
-Oh, my God.

30:05.130 --> 30:07.464
-(screams)
-Roger: Oh, my God!

30:07.547 --> 30:09.422
(screams)

30:09.506 --> 30:12.631
(shrieking)
I chipped my tooth!

30:12.714 --> 30:14.255
I didn't think you'd bite it.
It was artificial!

30:14.339 --> 30:16.047
Then what the fuck did
you offer it to me for?

30:16.130 --> 30:18.130
I thought you'd pick it up
and think it was great.

30:18.214 --> 30:19.798
-What are you,
fucking stupid?
-I'm sorry.

30:19.881 --> 30:22.172
(lisping):
You're sorry?
You're sorry?

30:22.255 --> 30:23.964
You think you're sorry?

30:24.047 --> 30:25.464
Shove it up your ass!

30:25.547 --> 30:27.923
(announcer speaks indistinctly)

30:29.881 --> 30:32.631
(lisping):
Kill that bastard.
I should sue him!

30:32.714 --> 30:34.631
At least yours
was an accident.

30:34.714 --> 30:36.923
My lawyer, he offered me
the fruit on purpose.

30:37.005 --> 30:38.297
At least I didn't
offer it to you.

30:38.381 --> 30:39.673
(lisping):
Well, now you know
how I feel.

30:39.756 --> 30:41.714
You smirked when I bit it.
You smirked!

30:41.798 --> 30:44.005
-(stammers) There was
no smirk. Get out of here.
-Smirk.

30:44.089 --> 30:46.506
And my dentist, also.
What?

30:46.589 --> 30:49.923
Can't see me till tomorrow?
I need that? It's an emergency!

30:50.005 --> 30:52.130
(phone chiming)

30:53.631 --> 30:54.839
Hello?

30:55.589 --> 30:58.589
(lisping):
Suspicious activity?
On my credit card?

30:58.923 --> 31:02.756
A thousand dollars
of papas bravas,
manchego cheese, paella?

31:03.255 --> 31:05.589
Uh! No!

31:05.673 --> 31:07.714
I didn't order that.
But I know who did!

31:07.798 --> 31:10.297
Francisco Zarzal.
Cancel my credit card!

31:10.381 --> 31:13.005
Come on. we have to find
Francisco Zarzal.

31:13.089 --> 31:14.964
-Francisco Zarzal.
-Let's go.

31:15.047 --> 31:16.756
Larry:
This guy's got some nerve.

31:16.839 --> 31:18.464
He play you
for a sucker.

31:18.547 --> 31:20.464
-He play you for
a straight sucker.
-Yeah.

31:20.547 --> 31:23.005
-It's stealing. It's just
stealing, plain and simple.
-It's bullshit.

31:23.089 --> 31:25.422
It's bullshit.
This is bullshit.

31:25.506 --> 31:28.381
-What the--?
-You'll see. Take a ride.

31:28.464 --> 31:31.506
-Jeff: All right.
-Leon: Bullshit.
Straight bullshit.

31:31.589 --> 31:32.964
(sighs)

31:33.798 --> 31:35.339
He's playing us
for suckers.

31:35.422 --> 31:36.881
(lisping):
Why do you sound like that?

31:36.964 --> 31:39.047
I chipped my tooth.
How about you?

31:39.130 --> 31:41.381
My tongue's all swollen.
It sucks.

31:41.464 --> 31:44.964
I have to call Zaragoza.
See if I can track down
Francisco Zarzal.

31:45.631 --> 31:48.297
(tires screech)

31:50.422 --> 31:52.506
♪ ♪

31:54.297 --> 31:56.130
-(Leon clears throat)
-Wow.

31:56.214 --> 31:58.923
(lisping):
Look at this.
This has to be it.

32:00.089 --> 32:02.005
-What is this?
- Lo siento. Lo siento.

32:02.089 --> 32:05.255
-Lo siento. Lo siento.
-Leon: Multo lo siento.

32:05.339 --> 32:06.923
-Lo siento.
-Leon: Multo lo siento.

32:07.005 --> 32:10.255
Excuse me. Have you seen
Francisco Zarzal?

32:10.339 --> 32:12.005
He's a server at Zaragoza?

32:12.089 --> 32:14.005
No, I haven't seen Francisco.

32:14.089 --> 32:15.673
-Lo siento.
-Lo siento.

32:15.756 --> 32:19.172
-Lo siento.
-Lo siento. Lo siento.
Lo siento.

32:20.381 --> 32:22.130
(sighs)

32:22.464 --> 32:24.839
I don't see him anywhere.
You know what I see?

32:24.923 --> 32:28.297
I see everything I paid for:
Floral arrangements,
the candles,

32:28.381 --> 32:29.923
the alcohol, everything.

32:30.005 --> 32:31.673
-Look at the sumptuous spread.
-Yeah.

32:31.756 --> 32:33.714
I paid for that, too.
Come on. Let's eat.

32:33.798 --> 32:37.089
-Hey, where the fuck you--
-Hey, hey. I'm already
going this way.

32:37.172 --> 32:39.172
-Give me a plate.
-(plates clattering)

32:39.255 --> 32:41.589
-Leon: Gimme some of that.
-(silverware, dishes clattering)

32:41.673 --> 32:44.172
-Give me some eggs.
-No toast?

32:45.297 --> 32:47.881
-There's no toast.
-You?

32:48.714 --> 32:50.214
Again with the toast?

32:50.297 --> 32:53.714
You have to have toast
when you eat eggs.
It's a necessity.

32:53.798 --> 32:55.464
What are you
even doing here?

32:55.547 --> 32:57.923
(scoffs)
Francisco!

32:58.839 --> 33:00.130
Excuse me.

33:00.214 --> 33:01.798
-Excuse me.
-Excuse me.

33:01.881 --> 33:03.881
Hello, Francisco.

33:03.964 --> 33:07.964
It seems as if
you've been using...

33:08.047 --> 33:09.673
my credit card.

33:09.756 --> 33:11.422
What do you have to say
for yourself?

33:11.506 --> 33:14.881
Excuse me, this is not a
conversación en la recepción
de Concepción Zarzal.

33:15.130 --> 33:16.714
Will you repeat that, please?

33:16.798 --> 33:20.631
I don't think this is a
conversación en la recepción
de Concepción Zarzal.

33:20.714 --> 33:21.923
We do it in Zaragoza.

33:22.005 --> 33:24.130
(lisping):
Oh, the conversation.

33:24.214 --> 33:26.255
(stammers) You want to have
the conversation at Zaragoza.

33:26.339 --> 33:27.964
Were these charges
from Zaragoza?

33:28.047 --> 33:29.673
No, not from Zaragoza.
From here.

33:29.756 --> 33:31.506
Or perhaps this is a mistake,

33:31.589 --> 33:33.839
because our cards,
they look very similar.

33:33.923 --> 33:37.005
-But perhaps I used the number,
but I don't under--
-Larry: Similar?

33:37.381 --> 33:40.214
How are they similar?
The numbers are not the same.

33:40.297 --> 33:43.464
The names are
certainly not the same.
One says Larry David,

33:43.547 --> 33:46.130
the other says
Francisco Zarzal.

33:46.214 --> 33:48.506
-It's not Zarzal,
it's Tharthal.
-(lisping): Zarzal.

33:48.589 --> 33:49.923
-Tharthal.
-(lisping): Zarzal.

33:50.005 --> 33:51.422
-Tharthal.
-(lisping): Zarzal.

33:51.506 --> 33:52.881
-Tharthal!
-(lisping): Zarzal.

33:52.964 --> 33:54.756
-Tharthal! Hijo de puta.
-(lisping): Zarzal?

33:54.839 --> 33:56.881
- Oye.  You're making fun
of the way we speak.
-No!

33:56.964 --> 33:59.547
-No, I'm not making fun.
My tooth is chipped.
-Don't mock me.

33:59.631 --> 34:01.673
-Lo siento.
-Lo siento.

34:01.756 --> 34:03.089
-They're making fun.
-They're making fun.

34:03.172 --> 34:04.631
-Larry: What? No, no, no!
-You're making fun.

34:04.714 --> 34:06.673
-What are you doing?
No, no, no, no.
-Lo siento.

34:06.756 --> 34:08.839
-Lo siento!
-Lo siento!

34:08.923 --> 34:10.714
-No disrespect!
No disrespect!
-Lo siento!

34:10.798 --> 34:14.297
They're making fun of us.
They're disrespecting us.

34:14.381 --> 34:16.297

Lo siento.

Sir, the Union
broke through our lines,

35:02.506 --> 35:04.964
and our troops have
retreated across
the Appomattox.

I need some time to myself.

Ahem.

35:29.047 --> 35:32.589
-So, look, I'm sure we'll go
over all this stuff upstairs--
-I don't think we should speak

35:32.673 --> 35:34.339
unless our attorneys
are present.

35:34.422 --> 35:37.297
You just have to know that
that whole thing was a--
It was a huge--

35:37.381 --> 35:40.547
The audience misunderstood
because I, I, she had a cold.

35:40.631 --> 35:43.214
You made a mockery
of the entire event.

35:43.297 --> 35:46.005
You made a mockery of
sexual harassment survivors.

35:46.089 --> 35:48.005
And you violated
the terms of our agreement.

35:48.089 --> 35:49.756
I think we should just
wait for the lawyers.

35:49.839 --> 35:52.756
Yeah, I had, I had
a whole speech prepared.
It was a great speech.

35:52.839 --> 35:54.964
I talked about Gloria Steinem.
You know, I had a picture of her

35:55.047 --> 35:57.089
up on my wall when
I was a teenager.

35:57.172 --> 35:59.089
She was really attractive.

35:59.172 --> 36:00.839
Excuse me?

36:00.923 --> 36:01.923
No?

36:02.005 --> 36:05.381
That's just completely
inappropriate.

36:05.464 --> 36:08.714
Okay. You know what?
Are you hungry?

36:09.047 --> 36:10.673
Um, a little.

36:10.756 --> 36:12.130

I have something for you.

They're fantastic.

-Why do you have these?

36:29.506 --> 36:32.756
Well, because I have a, uh,
I'm opening up a store.

T-try it. You'll love it.
Thank you.

36:38.714 --> 36:41.172

What do you think?

36:41.255 --> 36:42.881
Pretty good, right?

Yeah. Darn right,
they're good.
