00:02.170 --> 00:03.671
Lady Luck
is on your side
from LA to Vegas.

00:03.704 --> 00:06.907
What, are you gonna put
a sock on the cockpit door?
Don't cockpit-block me.

00:06.940 --> 00:08.342
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.376 --> 00:09.977
And check out
our other Fox programs,

00:10.010 --> 00:12.046
The Mick, The Last Man on Earth,

00:13.281 --> 00:14.582
The kids are gonna love it.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.919
* Whoa, Black Betty,
Bam-ba-Lam *

00:18.952 --> 00:20.888
* Whoa,
Black Betty, Bam-ba-Lam *

00:20.921 --> 00:22.890
* Black Betty had a child,
Bam-ba-Lam *

00:22.923 --> 00:25.159
* The damn thing gone wild,
Bam-ba-Lam *

00:25.193 --> 00:27.261
* She said, "I'm worryin'
outta mind," Bam-ba-Lam *

00:27.295 --> 00:29.430
* The damn thing gone blind,
Bam-ba-Lam *

00:29.463 --> 00:31.165
* I said "Oh, Black Betty,"
Bam-ba-Lam *

00:31.199 --> 00:32.533
* Whoa, Black Betty.

00:32.566 --> 00:33.867
-All right, Alan.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.505
You're not Alan.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.107
I am on the wrong plane.

00:41.242 --> 00:43.977
Tokyo, huh? Cool.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.080
Have a great flight.

00:47.715 --> 00:48.882
PILOT :
Jackpot Airlines.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.718
Northeast-bound to Las Vegas.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.721
*

01:03.431 --> 01:05.399
Papers, huh?

01:05.433 --> 01:08.035
I love papers: wall, toilet,

01:08.068 --> 01:09.903
failing New York Times.

01:09.937 --> 01:12.740
These are divorce papers,
so they're slightly less fun.

01:12.773 --> 01:13.974
Tough break, my friend.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.976
I'm in a state of shock
about it, Artem.

01:16.009 --> 01:18.212
I just got served
in the airport.

01:18.246 --> 01:20.381
And the guy was
very tricky about it.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.049
WOMAN :
Colin McCormack, please pick up

01:22.082 --> 01:25.052
the nearest
white courtesy telephone.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.787
Uh, excuse me.
Are you Colin McCormack?

01:26.820 --> 01:29.990
-Yes.
-You've been served.

01:30.023 --> 01:32.092
Oh, there's no call.
That was me.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.527
Love when they go for the phone.

01:34.528 --> 01:38.766
So sad. I will hug you now.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.268
Okay, thank you. Thank you.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.836
Hey, oy! I'm good. Uh...

01:42.870 --> 01:46.174
Could you do me a favor and
not tell everybody about this?

01:46.207 --> 01:48.776
You know, I'd rather the whole
plane didn't know my business.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.445
Of course, don't worry.
I'm very good at keeping secret.

01:51.479 --> 01:53.614
I will hug you again.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.683
Oh. Okay. Thank you, Artem.
Thank you.

01:57.785 --> 02:00.254
So did you hear we're gonna be
grounded in Vegas for the night?

02:00.288 --> 02:02.122
What? No. I had plans
in L.A. tonight.

02:02.156 --> 02:03.991
I was gonna go
to my friend Jeff's luau.

02:04.024 --> 02:06.827
-You hate luaus. -I hate Jeff,
too, but that's not the point.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.297
This was gonna be my first
night out in forever.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.131
God, this job
makes it impossible

02:11.165 --> 02:12.466
to have a social life.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.801
Right now, my only
social interactions

02:13.834 --> 02:15.203
are yelling at drunk passengers.

02:15.236 --> 02:18.038
-This iPad is broken.
-That's a magazine.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.473
BERNARD: It seems like
you're doing all right.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.842
What about all those fun party
pictures on your Instagram?

02:21.875 --> 02:23.877
-I faked them.
-But I saw your legs on a beach.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.447
Those were two hotdogs
and my CancÃºn screen saver.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.682
I take my like back.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.117
Hey, Captain Dave here.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.985
If you're looking for a little
female companionship,

02:32.019 --> 02:34.355
then head over to Madame's,
the oldest strip club in Vegas

02:34.388 --> 02:35.989
that's now Vegas's
newest retirement community.

02:36.023 --> 02:38.158
And those women could really use
someone to chat with.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.394
Tell them Craig sent you.

02:40.428 --> 02:42.663
'Cause that's what
they think my name is.

02:42.696 --> 02:46.500
Hey. I just wanted to come over
and see how you were doing.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.536
I'm good. How are you?

02:48.569 --> 02:50.037
Oh, I'm just asking
because Artem told me

02:50.070 --> 02:51.339
about the divorce papers.

02:51.372 --> 02:54.141
Oh, come on. He swore
he wouldn't tell anybody.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.210
Yeah, well, it's Artem,
so that's really on you.

02:56.244 --> 02:58.979
Anyway, you know, if there's
anything I can do...

02:59.012 --> 03:01.014
Ronnie, honestly, I'm okay.

03:01.048 --> 03:02.683
I just don't want
anybody else to know.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.686
Hey. How are you, Colin?

03:05.719 --> 03:07.988
Ah, good. So you know, too.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.890
Look, I know this is a
really difficult time for you,

03:09.923 --> 03:11.825
but the good news is
you now qualify

03:11.859 --> 03:13.327
for the Grapefruits
Divorce Special.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.828
You get two free lap dances

03:14.862 --> 03:16.230
and then they flatten
your wedding ring

03:16.264 --> 03:17.398
into a souvenir coin.

03:17.431 --> 03:19.533
Ah, two free lap dances. Artem!

03:19.567 --> 03:22.670
Is there anybody else you told
about my impending divorce?

03:22.703 --> 03:24.438
Me? No. I swear.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.573
DAVE :
Hey, Colin McCormack,

03:25.606 --> 03:26.907
this is your captain.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.676
Please report
to the front galley

03:28.709 --> 03:30.444
to discuss your
impending divorce.

03:30.478 --> 03:33.113
Okay.

03:33.146 --> 03:34.615
I don't know why you're mad.

03:34.648 --> 03:36.384
Everyone on this plane
is Team Colin,

03:36.417 --> 03:39.253
even the cheerleaders
going to Vegas for competition.

03:39.287 --> 03:40.721
Isn't that right, girls?

03:40.754 --> 03:42.556
You should get a lawyer
who will...

03:42.590 --> 03:45.626
ALL: Be aggressive!
Be, be aggressive!

03:45.659 --> 03:47.761
-Thanks, mate.
-Yeah.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.933
-Ugh.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.435
I specifically took tonight off

03:54.468 --> 03:56.904
to hang out with my friend
Krystal, and she bailed on me.

03:56.937 --> 03:58.539
God, it's so hard having
a social life

03:58.572 --> 03:59.873
in the stripper world.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.942
I have the same problem because
of the weird hours, right?

04:01.975 --> 04:05.313
Yeah, and all the fun girls
get exported by Saudi princes.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.715
So you're not doing
anything tonight?

04:07.748 --> 04:11.118
-Not anymore.
-Me neither.

04:11.151 --> 04:13.487
Would it be crazy
if we hung out?

04:13.521 --> 04:15.789
Mm, I don't know.
We've never hung out before.

04:15.823 --> 04:18.326
Although, I did have a dream
once where I braided your hair.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.793
I have the perfect face shape
for a braid.

04:19.827 --> 04:21.228
-That's what I said
in the dream. -Oh, my God!

04:21.261 --> 04:22.229
-Let's do it.
-Yay!

04:22.262 --> 04:23.464
And now you can finally post

04:23.497 --> 04:24.965
some fun, real pics
on Instagram.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.301
-Aw, you follow me.
-No, I follow Bernard.

04:27.335 --> 04:28.469
Oh.

04:28.502 --> 04:33.140
So, I heard you got slapped
with the big "D."

04:33.173 --> 04:35.476
-Divorce. It's rough.

04:35.509 --> 04:37.578
I've been there.
I've actually had three big D's

04:37.611 --> 04:39.012
slap me right across the face.

04:39.046 --> 04:40.914
You have to know
you're saying that wrong.

04:40.948 --> 04:44.985
The first month is the hardest.
You reevaluate everything.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.820
Month two, you start exploring.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.490
Go to Peru, do some ayahuasca,
buy a fun bowling shirt.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.091
And the next woman
that gives you attention,

04:51.124 --> 04:52.460
you marry immediately.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.428
But boredom brings
that second divorce.

04:54.462 --> 04:55.996
You start drinking,
get some tattoos,

04:56.029 --> 04:58.332
and on a bender,
you marry your tattoo artist.

04:58.366 --> 05:00.434
But by the time
the third divorce comes,

05:00.468 --> 05:02.102
you sign the papers
at the dog track

05:02.135 --> 05:05.005
and realize Scientology's
got some decent ideas.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.306
Huh.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.108
Well, if I'm honest,
I am a little peeved

05:08.141 --> 05:10.277
at the way that my ex
has been handling things.

05:10.310 --> 05:13.481
Yup. Let it out.
Build that fire.

05:13.514 --> 05:16.350
I mean, we promised we'd be
civil to each other, you know?

05:16.384 --> 05:18.652
I mean, my parents,
they did their divorce right.

05:18.686 --> 05:21.489
My father grew a beard,
mother went on a food journey

05:21.522 --> 05:23.391
with her "special friend"
Charlotte.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.192
No one gets out unscarred.

05:25.225 --> 05:27.661
My first ex-wife took the dog.
My second wife took the cat.

05:27.695 --> 05:30.130
And my third wife took the dog
from my first ex-wife.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.399
Her lawyer was amazing.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.866
You know what you really need?

05:32.900 --> 05:34.868
A night out with your boys
to blow off some steam.

05:34.902 --> 05:37.337
Well, I don't have
many "boys" anymore.

05:37.371 --> 05:39.673
I mean, honestly, it's tough
maintaining friendships

05:39.707 --> 05:42.242
when you spend every weekend
flying from L.A. to Vegas.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.144
I mean, really,
I only do three things:

05:44.177 --> 05:46.847
sleep, teach,
and fly out to see my son.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.148
Well, I only do three things:

05:48.181 --> 05:50.017
sleep, fly, and right wrongs
when I see them.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.318
And if you don't have boys,

05:51.351 --> 05:53.253
it's on me to take you out
for a guys night.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.088
-That is really not necessary.
-Too late.

05:55.122 --> 05:58.191
This bro-tisserie chicken is
already on the rack and rolling.

05:58.225 --> 06:01.261
Bernie, saddle up. We're taking
Colin out for a guys night.

06:01.294 --> 06:03.030
What's it gonna take you to go?

06:03.063 --> 06:05.198
Free drinks and you have to buy
ten tickets to my one-man show,

06:05.232 --> 06:07.034
Mother Eartha:
The Eartha Kitt Story.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.102
LA Weekly said
it was "lit well."

06:09.136 --> 06:10.270
Done, you're in.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.573
Hey, I want in
on this night with men,

06:12.606 --> 06:14.241
and I don't even care
what we're doing.

06:14.274 --> 06:16.009
I just have crazy FOMO.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.611
-What are you guys
talking about? -Your mom.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.079
Oh, what a slut, right?

06:19.112 --> 06:21.715
No, we're talking
about guys night. Right?

06:21.749 --> 06:24.184
Guys night?
I want to come. Please.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.386
-Fine, Alan. But no blow.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.856
Hold on, who's flying the plane?

06:28.889 --> 06:30.023
It's on autopilot.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.792
I save these hands
for takeoffs and landings.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.194
I mean, does a surgeon
do the middle of an operation?

06:34.227 --> 06:35.929
-Yes.
-You don't know. Come on, Alan.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.698
Let's look out the window
and play "Spot The Pools."

06:37.731 --> 06:39.332
Oh.

06:44.271 --> 06:46.273
*

06:51.912 --> 06:54.381
Hey, thank you
for lending me this dress.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.716
It's surprisingly heavy, though.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.051
Yeah, it's weighted
so I'm harder to kidnap.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.954
Your life is so cool. Like,
that's what I should be doing.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.491
I'm still young, I should be
afraid of getting kidnapped.

07:03.524 --> 07:04.592
You really should.
You're pretty enough.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.126
If you worked in the club,

07:06.159 --> 07:07.661
you'd be that
cocktail waitress that all

07:07.695 --> 07:10.831
-the guys are like, "Why isn't
she stripping?" -Aw. Thank you.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.766
I bet on the plane,
all the drunk passengers

07:12.800 --> 07:14.602
"accidentally" brush your butt
all the time.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.136
Yeah, and they "accidentally"
get hot coffee

07:16.169 --> 07:17.638
spilled on their junk.

07:17.671 --> 07:20.007
-Hmm. -That is the only action
I've had in the last six months.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.510
So I'd love to meet someone
where the groping is mutual.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.011
Well, you know what?

07:24.044 --> 07:25.846
-We're gonna make that happen
right now.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.648
This guy I'm sort of dating
has a friend

07:27.681 --> 07:29.817
who'd be perfect for you,
so I'm gonna see if he's around.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.752
Wow, okay. Oh, wait.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.187
If he's just home with no plans,
does that mean he's lame?

07:34.221 --> 07:35.923
Well, I didn't have plans,
so we're both lame.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.257
-Maybe this is a bad idea.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.792
-He said he's available.
-I'm in!

07:38.826 --> 07:40.594
-BOTH: Tequila soda!

07:41.862 --> 07:44.998
It is officially cool o'clock.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.334
-All right.
-All the homies are here.

07:47.367 --> 07:50.704
We're gonna pregame at the most
exclusive joint in town.

07:50.738 --> 07:51.772
-Cool.
-Nice.

07:51.805 --> 07:54.642
So, this is the most
exclusive joint in town?

07:54.675 --> 07:56.677
We're the only ones here,
aren't we?

07:56.710 --> 07:59.880
It's got everything we need:
free drinks, free food,

07:59.913 --> 08:01.214
and sweet, sweet tunes.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.684
I just downloaded
this killer karaoke app.

08:03.717 --> 08:06.219
I got the Spin Doctors'
"Two Princes" all cued up.

08:06.253 --> 08:07.955
Bernie, you want to sing first?

08:07.988 --> 08:09.489
Do I look like
I'm playing hacky sack

08:09.523 --> 08:10.624
on the quad at Dartmouth?

08:10.658 --> 08:12.392
Good call. Rest the pipes.
In the meantime,

08:12.425 --> 08:14.795
the oxygen bar is open!

08:14.828 --> 08:18.131
Oh. So we're all
gonna share that, are we?

08:18.165 --> 08:20.367
Yeah, man. Puff, puff, pass.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.471
*

08:24.504 --> 08:27.140
-Oh.
-Ah, they're cute!

08:27.174 --> 08:29.242
I think. I don't know;
it's so dark in here.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.478
Is it? Yeah, I spend
so much time in strip clubs,

08:31.511 --> 08:33.213
I can practically see
in the dark.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.182
It's called stripper vision.
It's a real thing.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.416
-Hi!
-Babe.

08:36.449 --> 08:39.753
Ronnie, this is Justin and Thad.

08:39.787 --> 08:40.988
They're magicians.

08:41.021 --> 08:42.556
They have the hottest show
in Vegas.

08:42.590 --> 08:45.258
I don't know about hottest,
but we're certainly...

08:45.292 --> 08:46.594
on fire.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.729
What?

08:48.762 --> 08:50.764
:
Oh. Wow, that's crazy.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.165
That wasn't me.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.533
That was me.

08:55.435 --> 08:56.837
-WOMAN: Put it out!
: They were both me.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.438
Whoa. They did not teach that

08:58.471 --> 09:00.841
in the magic kit
that I had growing up.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.275
I only knew
the cup-and-balls one.

09:02.309 --> 09:05.178
-That's not magic, that's
just good technique. -Hey.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.547
Thad is the guy
I was telling you about.

09:07.581 --> 09:08.949
Hi.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.687
Oh, Thad doesn't speak.
That's kind of our thing.

09:13.721 --> 09:15.188
Isn't that
Penn & Teller's thing?

09:15.222 --> 09:17.424
-Thad, don't yell. I got this.

09:17.457 --> 09:19.059
-We're
nothing like Penn & Teller.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.094
Their tall guy talks;
ours doesn't. Okay?

09:21.128 --> 09:23.130
Okay. But you can talk tonight,
though, right?

09:23.163 --> 09:25.098
I mean, it's not like
you're performing.

09:25.132 --> 09:28.435
Well, that's the about us--
we're always performing.

09:30.337 --> 09:32.606
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.542
Oh, God. Now you're just
torturing that poor woman.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.244
Let's go eat.

09:37.277 --> 09:40.213
You sure about these guys?

09:40.247 --> 09:41.949
Oh, yeah.
No, they're a little weird,

09:41.982 --> 09:43.216
but they're completely harmless.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.285
I can spot a creep
from a mile away.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.020
Stay away from that guy.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.958
Movie. Movie.

09:50.991 --> 09:53.727
-Mm-mmm. -Artem,
that means "movie" in charades.

09:53.761 --> 09:55.428
Oh, we're playing charades?

09:55.462 --> 09:57.064
Oh, I didn't know.
Wait. Okay.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.100
I love charades. So I...

10:00.133 --> 10:02.502
Three words.
I give you hint.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.638
It's a song.

10:04.672 --> 10:07.140
First word: "Stairway..."

10:07.174 --> 10:08.575
"To Heaven."
I win. And as winner,

10:08.608 --> 10:10.577
I say it's time
to get off this plane.

10:10.610 --> 10:11.812
Dave, what's next?

10:11.845 --> 10:13.180
Oh, I got a great night planned.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.614
We're gonna get steaks
at Ponderosa,

10:14.648 --> 10:16.516
then take a helicopter ride
over the Strip.

10:16.549 --> 10:19.019
But don't worry-- if it's
too windy, I got a plan B.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.621
A buddy of mine can get us
into this corporate event.

10:21.655 --> 10:24.491
Apparently, BeyoncÃ© and Jay-Z
are gonna play a set.

10:24.524 --> 10:26.326
!
-Bitch, that's plan A!

10:26.359 --> 10:28.495
No, I thought tonight was gonna
be about bonding over Colin's D,

10:28.528 --> 10:30.698
but if you guys want to go
to the party, let's bounce.

10:30.731 --> 10:31.799
Yeah!

10:31.832 --> 10:34.735
-Oh, yeah.
-"Crazy in Love."

10:38.638 --> 10:41.541
Hey, what happened to Jetway?

10:41.574 --> 10:43.143
Yeah, are we stuck here?

10:43.176 --> 10:45.145
Dave, didn't you tell the Jetway
guys we were gonna be up here?

10:45.178 --> 10:46.346
I was planning a guys night.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.848
This is Alan's fault.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.717
I didn't even know
we were coming back here.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.920
That's your problem, Alan--
you don't anticipate.

10:57.758 --> 11:01.294
-Good news: I spoke to
the Jetway driver.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.396
Bad news:
he's at his anniversary dinner

11:03.430 --> 11:05.032
with his-- wait for it--

11:05.065 --> 11:06.800
husband.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.702
This guy knows
what I'm talking about.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.170
Okay, so what does
this mean for us?

11:10.203 --> 11:12.672
It means we can finally live in
a society where love can win...

11:12.706 --> 11:14.241
No, what does it mean
for the plane?

11:14.274 --> 11:15.909
Oh. We're stuck
for a couple hours.

11:15.943 --> 11:19.679
-Oh, I have to cancel
my sunrise hike club.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.248
Guys, I'm bummed, too,

11:21.281 --> 11:23.483
but tonight is about Colin.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.418
Right? We have
a unique opportunity here.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.220
We have the whole plane
to ourselves.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.757
Isn't there anything
you ever dreamed of doing

11:29.790 --> 11:31.191
on an airplane?

11:31.224 --> 11:32.525
Sit in the captain's seat.

11:32.559 --> 11:34.227
Be serious, Alan.

11:34.261 --> 11:38.165
Now, we could spend the next
few hours being miserable...

11:38.198 --> 11:41.601
or actually having some fun.

11:41.634 --> 11:42.936
Which is it gonna be?

11:42.970 --> 11:45.005
*

11:45.038 --> 11:47.941
-DAVE: Guys night!
-Yeah!

11:48.608 --> 11:49.576
Blech!

11:49.609 --> 11:50.610
* One, two

11:50.643 --> 11:52.780
* Princes kneel before you

11:57.484 --> 11:59.019
* And go ahead now

11:59.052 --> 12:00.087
* If you

12:00.120 --> 12:01.621
* Want to call me baby

12:01.654 --> 12:03.090
-Okay. Okay, go. Wait.
-* Just go ahead now

12:03.123 --> 12:04.724
-* And if you

12:04.758 --> 12:06.359
-All right. Okay, close it.
-* Want to call me baby

12:06.393 --> 12:08.228
-ALL: Oh!
-* Just go ahead now

12:08.261 --> 12:09.296
* And if you

12:09.329 --> 12:11.298
* Want to buy me flowers

12:11.331 --> 12:13.066
* Just go ahead now

12:13.100 --> 12:15.803
Is there, is there, is there
a catch? How does it...

12:15.836 --> 12:17.470
* Just go a...
Guitar!

12:17.504 --> 12:19.139
*

12:25.779 --> 12:29.416
Tell me how you do
the coin-in-the-box trick.

12:29.449 --> 12:30.818
Nichole, there is
a magician's code,

12:30.851 --> 12:33.753
-and I cannot betray it.
-Well, if you tell me, I'll...

12:33.787 --> 12:35.655
-Mirrors, it's all mirrors.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.657
Anyway, that's why
my friend Stacy has an eye patch

12:37.690 --> 12:40.093
and I'm permanently banned
from the Sunglass Hut.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.864
Good talk, Thad.
What are you getting?

12:45.532 --> 12:47.434
Oh, good. Cards.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.502
This is a good one.
Pick a card, memorize it,

12:49.536 --> 12:50.770
-see what happens.
-Hmm.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.780
I don't get it.

13:05.485 --> 13:08.788
Hey, Nichole, do you want
to go get a drink at the bar?

13:08.822 --> 13:11.124
-But we have a waiter.
-Yeah, I know, but let's leave.

13:11.158 --> 13:12.692
Oh. Okay.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.798
You know,
I was initially skeptical

13:18.832 --> 13:21.801
about what exactly tonight
was gonna be, but, um...

13:21.835 --> 13:24.671
turns out a bit of nonsense
was exactly what I needed.

13:24.704 --> 13:27.307
See? Nights like this
recharge the system.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.776
-Ah. -Listen, I wish
I had some guys to take me out

13:29.809 --> 13:31.011
after my divorces.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.213
I don't have
many male friends, either.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.482
I relate to women better,

13:35.515 --> 13:39.019
probably because I'm willing
to go there.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.488
Oh, I have so many friends.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.957
Too many. Actually,
I'm in the midst of a cull.

13:43.991 --> 13:46.193
-But you're all on the list.
-COLIN: Well, at least

13:46.226 --> 13:49.662
that is one good thing that
this... divorce hath wrought.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.364
That's not the only thing.
Don't you feel like

13:51.398 --> 13:52.966
a weight has been lifted
off your shoulders?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.235
Dude, you're officially free.

13:55.268 --> 13:58.471
Yeah, the road has been paved
for you and Ronnie.

13:58.505 --> 14:01.041
Ronnie? Aw, come on,
we're just friends.

14:01.074 --> 14:03.310
Friends that almost boned
in the bathroom.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.378
Guys, Ronnie and I
would drive each other mad.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.380
I mean, she's
literally maddening.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.917
She's-she's stubborn
and she's combative and...

14:09.950 --> 14:12.886
and then there are the days
when she goes out of her way

14:12.920 --> 14:14.487
to do something
incredibly thoughtful,

14:14.521 --> 14:17.024
like she'll, she'll leave you
the last airline magazine

14:17.057 --> 14:19.559
with a blank crossword,
and-and... you know,

14:19.592 --> 14:22.162
you're left kind of amazed
that somebody so beautiful

14:22.195 --> 14:25.398
and delightful would spend
even 30 seconds of her day

14:25.432 --> 14:28.568
doing something just because she
knew it would make you happy.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.338
And... and that makes
all the stresses in your life

14:31.371 --> 14:33.373
seem to fade away.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.709
I'm sorry,
what was the question?

14:36.743 --> 14:39.012
None of us have talked
for, like, 20 minutes.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.013
Oh, dear God.

14:40.047 --> 14:43.350
News flash, amigo:
you dig Ronnie.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.958
Okay, why did you think
I would like that?

14:50.991 --> 14:53.126
-Well, he's a good listener.
-Can't argue with that.

14:53.160 --> 14:54.761
I mean, if you're not into it,
no worries.

14:54.794 --> 14:56.296
I can make him disappear.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.630
I made a joke my dad would like.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.099
No, I came here to have fun.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.400
I'm gonna give it another shot.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.469
I just need a drink or two.
Probably two.

15:02.502 --> 15:03.937
Uh, you have something
in your bra.

15:05.973 --> 15:08.575
God, I'm surprised
he hasn't given me a paper cut.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.546
Rough night?

15:13.580 --> 15:16.649
Uh, yeah. It's probably rougher
for the two women

15:16.683 --> 15:18.051
my date set on fire.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.419
Oh, is he an arsonist?

15:19.452 --> 15:22.155
Magician.

15:22.189 --> 15:24.992
Oh. So an arsonist in sequins.

15:26.994 --> 15:29.662
You know, I thought I wanted
a crazy, fun night out,

15:29.696 --> 15:31.664
but this place is so douchey.

15:31.698 --> 15:32.732
I mean, what is the theme?

15:32.765 --> 15:34.001
Too loud and cocaine
on the floor?

15:34.034 --> 15:36.303
You throw in jean shorts
and a Raiders jersey,

15:36.336 --> 15:38.105
and it's pretty much the theme
of Vegas.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.340
Maybe I'm trying too hard.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.675
I wish I'd stayed home and had
a grilled cheese and a beer.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.811
Hmm.

15:44.844 --> 15:47.314
Well, see you later.

15:47.347 --> 15:48.681
I hope your night gets better.

15:48.715 --> 15:49.983
I'll keep on the lookout

15:50.017 --> 15:51.818
for any cute blondes
bursting into flames.

15:51.851 --> 15:54.321
Well, if it ends the date,
I'm fine with it.

15:57.524 --> 15:58.591
Okay, here's what we know.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.693
I'm a little drunk,
I like Ronnie,

16:00.727 --> 16:02.595
and when I get nervous
I like to recap.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.531
-You got to go tell her.

16:04.564 --> 16:05.932
What, now?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.500
This is the exact wrong time.

16:07.534 --> 16:08.768
I just got my divorce papers.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.203
This is the exact right time.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.504
She's been texting me all night.

16:11.538 --> 16:12.772
She's on a terrible date
with a magician.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.174
You could swoop in
and rescue her.

16:14.207 --> 16:17.844
Hey, this is like the reverse
ending of a romantic comedy.

16:17.877 --> 16:22.482
You are at airport running to go
in other location.

16:22.515 --> 16:25.052
Do you really think
I should do this?

16:25.085 --> 16:28.121
No, chico, you have to do this.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.990
Okay. I'm gonna do it.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.192
That's right. We're trapped.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.226
I have an idea.

16:35.262 --> 16:37.364
According to
the Jackpot handbook,

16:37.397 --> 16:39.632
as senior flight attendant,
it is within my authority

16:39.666 --> 16:42.001
to declare an emergency
and deploy the evacuation slide.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.204
Did you guys hear me?

16:44.237 --> 16:46.206
We get to go down the slide!

16:46.239 --> 16:47.540
-Slide!
-ALL: Slide!

16:47.574 --> 16:50.743
Slide, slide, slide,
slide, slide, slide!

16:50.777 --> 16:52.379
Slide, slide, slide, slide!

16:52.412 --> 16:54.114
Slide, slide!

16:56.883 --> 16:59.152
:
Rope made of pants.

16:59.186 --> 17:01.020
Rope made of pants.

17:01.054 --> 17:04.091
Rope made of pants,
rope made of pants.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.725
ALL :
Rope made of pants.

17:05.758 --> 17:06.759
Rope made of pants.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.571
I just asked for a napkin, dude.

17:20.207 --> 17:21.874
WAITER:
I'm sorry for the wait.

17:21.908 --> 17:23.110
I'm sorry. I didn't
actually order this.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.044
Uh, compliments of the chef.

17:25.078 --> 17:26.946
-Me.

17:26.979 --> 17:30.717
Yep. Also the owner of this
whole loud, cocaine-y place.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.519
I love you guys, by the way.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.920
Ah, you've seen our show.

17:33.953 --> 17:35.522
No.

17:35.555 --> 17:39.359
* The sky is blue,
I can taste the colors *

17:39.392 --> 17:40.360
* I know, I know...

17:41.994 --> 17:43.896
-Oh, this is high.
-Almost there, Frenchy.

17:43.930 --> 17:44.964
-Aah!
-Whoa!

17:47.100 --> 17:49.869
The rope. How will you get down?

17:49.902 --> 17:50.970
Don't worry about us.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.305
Just go get the girl.

17:55.775 --> 17:58.878
And hamburgers! I'm hungry!

17:58.911 --> 18:00.747
Thanks for the grilled cheese.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.215
My date loved it.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.983
Well, you know,
that's not even my specialty.

18:04.016 --> 18:05.785
You should let me
make you breakfast.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.288
That sounded sleazy. I meant to
say I'm really good with eggs.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.790
Let me try again.
You're really cute.

18:10.823 --> 18:13.460
Let me make you breakfast.
No. That's the same.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.961
I'm gonna let it slide this time

18:14.994 --> 18:17.897
because I bashed your restaurant
right to your face.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.266
Well, you weren't wrong,
you know.

18:19.299 --> 18:20.833
This place isn't me.

18:20.867 --> 18:23.136
I opened the first restaurant
in Portland.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.572
Then Vegas threw a bunch
of money at me to open one here.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.440
And in Portland,
we were farm to table.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.176
Here we're farm to freezer

18:29.209 --> 18:31.511
to truck to distribution center

18:31.544 --> 18:32.512
to train to truck to here.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.414
Wow, so you're a sellout.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.982
Yeah, total sellout.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.352
Um, we took care
of that grilled cheese,

18:39.386 --> 18:41.020
but I still owe you a beer.

18:41.053 --> 18:43.156
You want to go someplace better
than this and grab a drink?

18:43.190 --> 18:47.627
Uh, thank you, but I shouldn't
leave my friend with those guys.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.429
If they try to cut her in half
or something,

18:49.462 --> 18:50.630
I'll feel responsible.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.632
It's cool. Totally cool.

18:52.665 --> 18:55.001
Everybody knows
getting cut in half sucks.

18:55.034 --> 18:57.136
Well, thank you
for the grilled cheese.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.171
You got it.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.842
Where are you going?
He was totally into you.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.477
Yeah, he asked me out
for a drink,

19:04.511 --> 19:05.678
but I didn't want
to bail on you.

19:05.712 --> 19:06.813
Thank you. I get it.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.381
Girl code. Lena Dunham.
Traveling Pants.

19:08.415 --> 19:09.849
But I came here to get you a guy

19:09.882 --> 19:11.684
and that's the kind of guy
you ditch your friends for.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.152
Aw, we're friends?

19:13.186 --> 19:14.354
Yeah. You're wearing my dress

19:14.387 --> 19:15.888
and we feel the same way
about Ryan Gosling.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.357
BOTH:
Hot but not sexy,

19:17.390 --> 19:18.658
except in Drive.

19:18.691 --> 19:21.160
You're crazy not to go out
with that guy.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.162
He's cute. He cooks.

19:23.196 --> 19:25.164
He's clearly willing to listen
to you complain.

19:25.198 --> 19:26.666
Why are you still standing here
talking to me?

19:29.669 --> 19:30.837
Excuse me, excuse me.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.839
Hello, hi. Excuse me.
Hi, I'm sorry.

19:32.872 --> 19:36.376
No, I don't have a reservation,
but I do have a, I have a...

19:43.883 --> 19:45.418
Hi.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.086
Hi. Wow.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.522
I just realized I've never seen
you out of your uniform before.

19:49.556 --> 19:51.891
You look amazing.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.527
Thank you.
What are you doing here?

19:54.561 --> 19:56.329
Oh, it's a long story.
I got trapped on a plane.

19:56.363 --> 19:59.266
I climbed down a-a rope
made of blankets.

19:59.299 --> 20:00.700
It was a whole situation.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.035
Yeah, I've had
a bit of a weird night, too,

20:03.069 --> 20:05.171
but things are looking up.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.673
Okay, that's...

20:06.706 --> 20:08.541
that's exactly why
I wanted to talk to you.

20:08.575 --> 20:09.876
-I...

20:09.909 --> 20:11.177
Yeah. Uh, this is Bryan.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.413
He owns the restaurant,
and he saved me

20:13.446 --> 20:14.581
from my terrible date.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.182
-Ah. -We were just about
to go get a drink,

20:16.215 --> 20:18.385
but we-we could stay.

20:18.418 --> 20:21.288
No. No, God, no.
No, you guys go.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.923
No, I've got my lads meeting me
here in a bit, anyway, you know.

20:23.956 --> 20:26.526
Actually, I hear this place
has really excellent...

20:26.559 --> 20:28.227
food.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.397
We do have food.

20:30.430 --> 20:33.633
Great, I will order
some of that, then.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.768
All right.
So, I'll see you Sunday?

20:35.802 --> 20:38.571
Yes. Yes. Get out of here,
kids, have fun.

20:38.605 --> 20:41.408
Hey, Colin.
You missed the magic.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.743
Seems like I did.

20:43.776 --> 20:47.380
* There's a love
in my heart... *

20:47.414 --> 20:49.115
Oh, no.

20:49.148 --> 20:51.384
She rejected you.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.486
Here comes another hug.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.488
No, I didn't even get
to tell her.

20:55.522 --> 20:57.590
How did you guys all get here?

20:57.624 --> 20:59.091
Uber.

20:59.125 --> 21:00.793
Oh, you mean from the plane.

21:00.827 --> 21:01.961
The Jetway guy showed up

21:01.994 --> 21:03.896
literally one minute
after you left.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.832
So, you didn't get the girl,

21:05.865 --> 21:07.233
but you got something else:

21:07.266 --> 21:09.936
four ice-cold bros.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.404
That I did.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.806
You know, thank you all so much
for this, really.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.174
Of course.

21:15.207 --> 21:18.611
No one should ever have
to handle the big "D" alone.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.179
Yep, now I hear it.

21:20.212 --> 21:22.849
Oh, man. I said it
so many times tonight.

21:22.882 --> 21:25.117
Well, here's to my four...

21:25.151 --> 21:27.286
Hold on a second. Where's Alan?

21:27.320 --> 21:30.323
Yeah, where'd we leave
that little man?

21:46.072 --> 21:48.040
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

21:50.309 --> 21:52.379
You've hit the jackpot
with LA to Vegas.

21:52.412 --> 21:54.814
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.818
Who's ready
for a Fox Sunday Survey?

21:58.851 --> 22:00.186
-Okay.
-Okay.

22:00.219 --> 22:01.854
Okay, I guess.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.456
-Okay.
-Let's do it!

22:03.490 --> 22:05.692
-Are you in love
with Bob's Burgers?
-Yes.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.126
-Yes!

22:07.159 --> 22:08.294

22:15.568 --> 22:16.803

22:16.836 --> 22:19.138
Don't miss the funniest night
on television.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.673
Lightsaber?
Not on the menu.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.141
No way!
No!

22:22.174 --> 22:25.945
See it all first,
Sundays on Fox.
