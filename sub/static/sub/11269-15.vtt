00:01.283 --> 00:04.051
Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:04.120 --> 00:06.020
Hey, Sam. Sorry I'm late.

00:06.088 --> 00:08.022
Had to stop at the drug store.

00:08.074 --> 00:09.974
That's okay, Woody.
Yep.

00:10.043 --> 00:13.045
Had to make another embarrassing
trip to the drug store

00:13.112 --> 00:15.613
to get a little, uh...

00:15.681 --> 00:17.982
Protection?
Yeah.

00:18.051 --> 00:20.852
You know, Kelly and I want
to have a family and all,

00:20.853 --> 00:23.555
but we figured we'd
wait until after that raise you promised.

00:23.556 --> 00:26.358
Hope you got a lot
of protection.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.543
Well, as usual, you know,
I'm a little embarrassed

00:28.544 --> 00:30.212
and nervous when I go in there,

00:30.279 --> 00:32.214
so I buy a whole bunch of stuff

00:32.215 --> 00:34.249
so it doesn't look
like I'm just trying

00:34.250 --> 00:35.783
to get some... you know.

00:35.852 --> 00:36.952
Protection.

00:37.019 --> 00:40.455
Yeah. So I got some
paper plates...

00:40.522 --> 00:42.924
batteries, flashbulbs,

00:42.992 --> 00:45.327
Skol...

00:45.394 --> 00:47.996
some gum...

00:48.064 --> 00:51.833
Chia Pet...

00:51.901 --> 00:53.969
oh, eyeglass repair kit...

00:54.036 --> 00:56.171
Yeah.

00:56.239 --> 00:58.606
Oh, notebook paper...

00:58.708 --> 01:01.242
and... VO5.

01:01.310 --> 01:02.844
Where's the, uh...

01:02.912 --> 01:04.879
where's the protection?

01:09.134 --> 01:11.569
See you in about an hour, Sam.

02:26.896 --> 02:28.979
Hi, Ma.

02:29.047 --> 02:30.331
Hey! Look who's here.

02:30.399 --> 02:32.116
Serafina!

02:32.184 --> 02:34.414
What are you
doing here? I need to talk to you.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.170
You're pregnant.

02:36.171 --> 02:37.472
REBECCA:
Carla, that is

02:37.473 --> 02:39.240
a rude and unfair thing to say.

02:39.241 --> 02:41.409
There's a million reasons why your
daughter would want to talk to you.

02:41.410 --> 02:43.344
I am pregnant.

02:44.780 --> 02:47.381
Then again, you raised a slut.

02:47.449 --> 02:48.616
Sit down.

02:48.684 --> 02:51.185
Now, oh, God...

02:51.253 --> 02:52.854
first of all...

02:52.922 --> 02:55.089
are you getting sick
in the morning?

02:55.157 --> 02:58.025
A little bit, but I
haven't had to "Clavin,"

02:58.093 --> 02:59.694
if that's what you mean.

03:01.997 --> 03:03.815
And to answer
your next question,

03:03.883 --> 03:05.583
no, it wasn't planned.

03:05.651 --> 03:08.586
Oh, Serafina...
I have been praying

03:08.654 --> 03:10.805
that this day wouldn't come,

03:10.873 --> 03:13.241
but I can't say I'm
all that surprised.

03:13.309 --> 03:14.742
In fact,

03:14.810 --> 03:18.129
I have this little speech
I've been carrying around

03:18.197 --> 03:20.365
in case it did happen.

03:25.605 --> 03:27.739
"Dear Serafina,

03:27.806 --> 03:31.676
soon you will be 14 and able
to think for yourself."

03:31.744 --> 03:33.245
Mom.

03:33.312 --> 03:34.979
I'm 18.

03:35.047 --> 03:36.681
That's right, you are.

03:36.749 --> 03:38.650
None of this applies.

03:39.885 --> 03:42.754
(groans)
So, do you know who the father is?

03:42.822 --> 03:44.022
Yes.

03:44.090 --> 03:47.525
Oh, honey, I'm so proud!

03:47.593 --> 03:51.362
It's Pat McDougall,
the guy I've been going with.

03:51.430 --> 03:52.847
Isn't he that retired cop

03:52.848 --> 03:55.216
who's just living off
his disability? That's right.

03:55.217 --> 03:57.868
And now he wants to marry me.

03:57.936 --> 03:59.136
Do you love him?

03:59.204 --> 04:01.789
Yes.
Then don't marry him.

04:01.857 --> 04:03.424
What?

04:03.425 --> 04:06.344
The worst thing you could do,
Serafina, is marry for love.

04:06.345 --> 04:09.514
You know, when I first met
your deadbeat father, Nick,

04:09.581 --> 04:11.015
I loved him, too.

04:11.083 --> 04:15.519
Even when he knocked up
my sister, I said...

04:15.587 --> 04:17.788
hey, look, the guy
is just trying

04:17.856 --> 04:21.125
to get in good with the
family at my wedding.

04:22.761 --> 04:25.847
But for the next ten years,
all he did was cheat on me,

04:25.915 --> 04:28.505
treat me like dirt and keep
me in maternity clothes.

04:28.517 --> 04:30.602
Mom, it's not like that-
Pat's a good man.

04:30.669 --> 04:32.303
He loves me and I love him,

04:32.371 --> 04:34.739
and we want to build
a life for our baby.

04:34.807 --> 04:36.340
Please give us your blessing.

04:37.593 --> 04:40.461
Well... you're not
gonna get that alimony

04:40.529 --> 04:42.196
by staying single.

04:42.264 --> 04:44.048
Mom, you're the best!

04:44.116 --> 04:46.551
Hey, my daughter's
getting married!

04:46.619 --> 04:48.803
Hey!
Oh!

04:48.870 --> 04:50.655
This'll be interesting.
Yeah.

04:50.722 --> 04:53.132
Finally, a wedding where
I don't envy the bride.

04:53.879 --> 04:56.995
Thanks, Ma-
you won't regret this.

04:56.996 --> 04:59.597
And listen, Pat and I are
gonna pay for the whole thing.

04:59.598 --> 05:01.782
Oh, no, no, no, no,
you are my daughter,

05:01.850 --> 05:04.051
and you're in love,
and I'm gonna make you

05:04.052 --> 05:06.954
the best reception I can-
we're pulling out all the stops.

05:06.955 --> 05:10.708
You know, there is an elegant,
tasteful restaurant upstairs,

05:10.776 --> 05:13.511
and as luck would have it,
I am boinking the owner.

05:15.998 --> 05:17.966
Hey, Hill! It's Carla.

05:18.033 --> 05:21.235
Come on down here,
we got to talk.

05:21.236 --> 05:22.721
Hill? What are you doing?
Come on.

05:22.722 --> 05:24.412
You don't have to
have it up there.

05:24.413 --> 05:25.757
Have it down here at Cheers.

05:25.758 --> 05:27.792
Oh, no, no, we can have
the reception here,

05:27.793 --> 05:30.228
but we got to have
the ceremony upstairs. Why?

05:30.295 --> 05:33.331
Every wedding we have
at Cheers is a disaster.

05:33.398 --> 05:35.100
Uh, remember you and Diane?

05:35.167 --> 05:36.601
This place is jinxed.

05:36.602 --> 05:39.137
No, it's not- you're just
thinking of the bad ones.

05:39.138 --> 05:41.272
What about, uh,
Barry and JoAnne?

05:41.340 --> 05:43.074
Barry! Come here.

05:43.142 --> 05:45.743
Barry, how's it going
with you and JoAnne?

05:45.810 --> 05:48.813
Where have you been, in a cave?

05:54.019 --> 05:57.722
All right, Miss Tortelli,
just what is it?

05:57.790 --> 06:01.058
My daughter Serafina has just
announced she's getting married.

06:01.126 --> 06:02.544
Congratulations.

06:02.611 --> 06:04.379
When's the baby due?

06:10.736 --> 06:14.438
SERAFINA (calling):
Here I come, Mom! Get ready!

06:14.506 --> 06:17.025
What do you think?

06:17.092 --> 06:18.759
SAM:
That's great, Serafina.

06:18.827 --> 06:21.062
You look great.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.481
Kind of sleazy for
a wedding outfit.

06:23.548 --> 06:26.750
Sam, that was my wedding dress.

06:27.853 --> 06:29.153
When I say "sleazy,"

06:29.221 --> 06:32.456
I mean sleazy in a beautiful
young bride kind of way.

06:35.810 --> 06:38.529
Carla, is that Cap'n Gus
and his Polka Pirates?

06:40.015 --> 06:42.816
It's my daughter's
wedding, isn't it?

06:42.884 --> 06:46.037
Ah, Miss Tortelli,
there you are,

06:46.105 --> 06:48.606
an hour behind schedule, I see.

06:48.674 --> 06:52.143
You're as prompt
as you are lovely.

06:52.211 --> 06:54.045
What do you want, Hill?

06:54.113 --> 06:56.914
And by the way, you have
your toupee on wrong.

06:56.982 --> 06:59.316
The hair goes on the outside.

06:59.384 --> 07:01.636
Miss Tortelli, I'm
here to remind you

07:01.704 --> 07:05.473
that this wedding must be
over by 11:30 on the dot.

07:05.541 --> 07:07.108
That's when I open for lunch.

07:07.175 --> 07:08.435
You open for lunch at noon.

07:08.460 --> 07:11.261
I know your family-
they leave at 11:30;

07:11.329 --> 07:14.198
At 11:31 the
Orkin man arrives.

07:15.894 --> 07:19.403
And please also
remind your guests

07:19.404 --> 07:21.305
that even though
this is a wedding,

07:21.373 --> 07:22.740
it is still a restaurant.

07:22.807 --> 07:26.010
No shoes, no shirt, no service.

07:26.077 --> 07:28.796
Hi, everybody.

07:28.864 --> 07:29.981
Hey, Kelly, Woody.

07:30.049 --> 07:33.367
I'll go put this on
the gift table, Woody.

07:33.435 --> 07:36.170
Uh, hey, Woody, what'd you
get for the happy couple?

07:36.238 --> 07:39.524
Ah, well, strictly
between you and me,

07:39.591 --> 07:43.027
went up in the attic,
dug up one of our wedding gifts.

07:43.287 --> 07:46.764
One of the ugliest things
I ever saw.

07:46.765 --> 07:48.866
We couldn't wait
to get rid of it.

07:48.867 --> 07:50.184
Ah, yeah, so you just
thought you'd, uh,

07:50.185 --> 07:51.719
pass it on to the
happy couple, huh?

07:51.720 --> 07:52.720
Good thinking.

07:52.721 --> 07:53.988
So, uh, what is it?

07:54.056 --> 07:57.242
Oh, a set of
Star Trek steak knives.

07:57.309 --> 07:58.710
FRASIER:
Woody, damn it!

07:58.777 --> 08:00.594
That gift was
from Lilith and me!

08:03.398 --> 08:06.468
They're delightfully whimsical
and-and very utilitarian.

08:06.501 --> 08:08.169
Uh, I-I'm sorry Dr. Crane.

08:08.170 --> 08:09.270
I didn't realize.

08:09.271 --> 08:11.238
Well, all right, Woody.

08:11.307 --> 08:13.117
To tell you the
truth, I, I was doing

08:13.175 --> 08:15.009
the same thing you
were doing. I...

08:15.076 --> 08:17.795
Fobbing off a gift
that we thought

08:17.863 --> 08:20.197
was the worst thing
we ever got.

08:20.265 --> 08:21.315
Thanks a lot, Fras.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.033
That was from Vera and me.

08:25.871 --> 08:27.738
You and Vera gave those away?

08:27.806 --> 08:30.708
You better not tell Ma.

08:30.776 --> 08:32.827
Hey, there.

08:32.828 --> 08:33.895
Remember me?

08:33.895 --> 08:34.929
Yes, I do.

08:34.929 --> 08:36.898
You're Carla's son, Gino.

08:36.899 --> 08:38.131
And I did not appreciate

08:38.133 --> 08:41.735
the nude photos of
yourself that you sent.

08:41.804 --> 08:44.754
You know, it's the best I could
do at the machine at the mall.

08:46.787 --> 08:49.777
Gino, would you
forget about it?

08:49.778 --> 08:51.012
I'm not gonna go out with you.

08:51.013 --> 08:52.213
You're much too young for me.

08:52.214 --> 08:54.315
Oh. Yeah, right.

08:54.382 --> 08:55.983
Coo-coo-ca-choo,
Miss Howe.

08:58.187 --> 08:59.938
Thanks for everything, Mom.

09:00.005 --> 09:02.707
Oh, honey, you know,
I got to admit

09:02.708 --> 09:04.943
that I wasn't too crazy
about this at first.

09:04.944 --> 09:08.563
But after spending this last
week getting the wedding ready

09:08.630 --> 09:10.698
and being with you
and everything,

09:10.766 --> 09:13.067
I got to say it's been
the best week of my life.

09:13.135 --> 09:14.902
Me, too.

09:16.922 --> 09:19.907
Ah, am I in time
for the nuptials?!

09:23.361 --> 09:24.878
Daddy!

09:24.946 --> 09:25.996
Nick.

09:26.047 --> 09:28.732
My little girl,
you look so beautiful.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.801
(giggles)

09:30.869 --> 09:34.071
Are those implants?!

09:45.900 --> 09:47.835
Carla...

09:47.903 --> 09:49.837
it's been a fortnight.

09:52.174 --> 09:53.741
You colouring your hair?

09:53.808 --> 09:55.660
I cannot believe this.

09:55.727 --> 09:58.095
What else could
possibly go wrong?

09:59.014 --> 10:01.298
Hi, gang at Cheers!

10:01.366 --> 10:02.650
Sorry I'm late,

10:02.718 --> 10:04.852
but I had to park the car.

10:04.920 --> 10:08.388
And then I had walk
from the car to here.

10:10.275 --> 10:12.443
How did you find out
about this?

10:12.444 --> 10:13.644
My cousin Eddy called me.

10:13.645 --> 10:15.279
He-he told me he
read it in the paper.

10:15.280 --> 10:18.549
So I figured, uh, my invitation
got lost in the mail.

10:18.617 --> 10:20.417
Daddy, I'm so glad you're here.

10:20.418 --> 10:22.152
I can't wait for you
to meet my fiancé.

10:22.153 --> 10:23.788
Stay right here;
I'll bring him down. Okay.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.022
Hey, Nick.

10:25.090 --> 10:26.390
Hey, Sam!

10:26.458 --> 10:29.226
Hey. You, are not
welcome here.

10:29.227 --> 10:31.562
Now, you just do us all
a favour and leave, okay?

10:31.563 --> 10:33.031
You have no right to be here.

10:33.098 --> 10:34.298
I have a right to be here!

10:34.366 --> 10:36.350
I am the father of the bride!

10:36.418 --> 10:40.521
I have a responsibility to give
away the hand of the betrothed!

10:40.589 --> 10:42.990
It's what's called
loin entitlement.

10:44.759 --> 10:47.528
You smelly little wart.

10:47.529 --> 10:49.230
See, Kelly, we're not
the only couple

10:49.231 --> 10:51.521
who has cute little nicknames
for each other.

10:53.401 --> 10:56.554
Carla, I have to be
honest with you.

10:56.555 --> 10:58.089
When I heard about
this wedding,

10:58.090 --> 11:00.624
I was very hurt that
you excluded us.

11:00.693 --> 11:03.594
After all, a marriage is
a time for forgiveness

11:03.662 --> 11:05.730
and healing.

11:05.731 --> 11:07.231
We drove 22 hours to get here.

11:07.232 --> 11:08.465
We even bought a
beautiful present.

11:08.466 --> 11:09.516
(snaps twice)

11:11.503 --> 11:13.604
It's a set of Star
Trek steak knives.

11:17.642 --> 11:19.272
Anyway, I have a
right to be here.

11:19.273 --> 11:20.511
I'm, uh, I'm gonna stay.

11:20.512 --> 11:21.546
Yeah?

11:21.547 --> 11:24.348
You can just drive
22 hours back.

11:24.349 --> 11:25.516
SAM:
Oh, come on, Carla.

11:25.517 --> 11:26.984
It took them
so long to get here.

11:26.985 --> 11:28.953
And-and, you know,
he is her father.

11:29.021 --> 11:32.006
Oh, fine, fine.

11:32.073 --> 11:34.441
You want Nick to be at
my daughter's wedding?

11:34.510 --> 11:36.110
Well, you can have him.

11:36.177 --> 11:37.712
Just have a great time!

11:37.779 --> 11:39.714
Oh, come on, Carla.

11:39.781 --> 11:41.048
Yeah, women, women.

11:41.116 --> 11:42.950
Isn't it enough
we sleep with them?

11:49.324 --> 11:54.145
So, uh, Nick, what have you
been up to lately, huh?

11:54.213 --> 11:56.247
Oh, uh, well, we still live

11:56.248 --> 11:58.015
in the glamorous
environs of Las Vegas,

11:58.016 --> 11:59.650
although we recently did move.

11:59.651 --> 12:01.685
We didn't like
our old neighbourhood,

12:01.686 --> 12:05.089
so we just drove our house
to a better one.

12:06.958 --> 12:09.660
Oh, uh, so how's
the career going, Nick?

12:09.728 --> 12:10.928
Last time we chatted,

12:10.929 --> 12:12.597
you were talking
about marketing some kind

12:12.598 --> 12:14.899
of a, slot machine
for the home.

12:14.967 --> 12:17.468
Oh yeah, "Flush and Win."

12:17.535 --> 12:18.803
It was a great idea.

12:18.804 --> 12:20.938
The only problem is that
people had a difficult time

12:20.939 --> 12:22.406
retrieving their change.

12:24.275 --> 12:26.561
Yeah, but I'm onto
something very big now.

12:26.628 --> 12:30.264
And this is an opportunity for
me to include you, my friends,

12:30.332 --> 12:31.592
in this future affluence.

12:31.600 --> 12:34.001
Well, you know how I hate
to be apart from Vera...

12:34.069 --> 12:37.721
Wait, wait, sit,
sit, hear me out.

12:37.789 --> 12:40.190
I know I've had some crazy
schemes in the past,

12:40.258 --> 12:43.127
but this is then and that
was then and this is now.

12:46.131 --> 12:48.815
This is completely legit.

12:48.883 --> 12:53.921
I have an opportunity, to
purchase, an orang-utan act.

12:56.324 --> 13:00.544
Did he say
"purchase" or "join"?

13:00.611 --> 13:03.013
Just need a couple of backers.

13:03.081 --> 13:05.983
Hear this: three apes,

13:06.050 --> 13:08.519
some banana oil,

13:08.587 --> 13:12.089
and a broad that's
had all her shots.

13:13.213 --> 13:15.842
Nicky, we missed you, lad.

13:15.843 --> 13:18.162
CLIFF:
Hey, uh, Nick,

13:18.230 --> 13:20.264
if you want somebody
to invest in that,

13:20.265 --> 13:21.999
uh, act of yours there,
for Vegas,

13:22.000 --> 13:24.068
you ought to go talk
to blondie over there.

13:24.069 --> 13:25.235
Yeah, she's loaded.

13:26.621 --> 13:27.671
Thank you.

13:27.706 --> 13:30.174
Listen, you come to
Vegas, you're comped.

13:33.929 --> 13:35.896
Excuse me, young man.

13:39.150 --> 13:42.736
Hello Miss.
I'm Nick Tortelli.

13:42.804 --> 13:44.354
Hello. I'm Kelly Boyd.

13:44.422 --> 13:46.957
I can tell by your organda

13:47.025 --> 13:50.094
that you have taste
and discernment.

13:50.161 --> 13:52.013
Thank you.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.814
Knock, knock.

13:53.881 --> 13:55.966
Who's there?

13:56.034 --> 13:58.652
Opportunity.

13:58.719 --> 14:01.705
Opportunity who?

14:01.773 --> 14:04.241
This is gonna take some time.

14:10.448 --> 14:14.118
People, people,
it's getting late.

14:14.119 --> 14:16.487
Now no one admires the sight
of a beautiful young bride

14:16.488 --> 14:19.223
more than I, but the lunch
rush is the lunch rush.

14:19.291 --> 14:22.593
Say John, I, I bet you'd like
to meet Carla's first husband.

14:22.660 --> 14:24.962
Oh, my God!

14:29.784 --> 14:32.002
Nice to meet you.
Please.

14:32.070 --> 14:34.905
My profession requires
that I handle food.

14:38.126 --> 14:43.780
Daddy, this is my fiancé, Pat.

14:43.848 --> 14:44.898
Nice to meet you, sir.

14:44.899 --> 14:46.317
Aw, enough of
the chit-chat.

14:46.318 --> 14:47.784
Step into my office.

14:50.088 --> 14:53.390
How do you propose to,
uh, support my progeny?

14:53.458 --> 14:56.260
Well, I'm a retired
police officer

14:56.328 --> 14:58.329
and currently living
off disability.

14:58.396 --> 15:00.146
What is the nature
of your injury?

15:00.148 --> 15:01.465
Whiplash.

15:01.533 --> 15:04.301
Very good, difficult
to disprove.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.504
Very bright.

15:07.572 --> 15:08.973
Thank you, sir.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.707
Bright enough to invest?

15:10.775 --> 15:12.009
Pardon me?

15:12.077 --> 15:14.345
Bright enough
to place your future

15:14.346 --> 15:16.080
and the future of
your entire progeny

15:16.081 --> 15:18.449
in the orang-utan act?

15:21.719 --> 15:23.954
Come on, Carla, don't do this.

15:24.022 --> 15:26.023
He has no right to be here.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.391
I raised those kids.

15:27.459 --> 15:28.558
He just split.

15:28.626 --> 15:29.893
Yeah, I, I know that.

15:29.961 --> 15:31.462
I made all the sacrifices.

15:31.529 --> 15:33.730
I had to bear all the
burden, he did nothing.

15:33.798 --> 15:36.967
Nothing. Well, what are you
gonna do, you know, the guy's here?

15:37.035 --> 15:39.970
(drawer slams)
(yelling in pain)

15:40.038 --> 15:43.106
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15:43.175 --> 15:47.010
Sam, those kids are
all I got, okay?

15:47.078 --> 15:48.145
I know.

15:48.213 --> 15:50.080
They're all that matters to me.

15:50.081 --> 15:51.348
He doesn't care about that.

15:51.349 --> 15:52.683
He doesn't care who he hurts.

15:52.684 --> 15:53.917
(knock at door)

15:53.985 --> 15:55.553
Yeah, but...

15:55.620 --> 15:58.238
Sam, Sam could you
hurry it up a bit?

15:58.239 --> 16:01.208
Captain Gus has just played the
polka version of "Hava Nagila."

16:01.209 --> 16:03.110
He's managed to
insult two cultures.

16:04.746 --> 16:06.580
I'm not, I'm not
doing any good here.

16:06.581 --> 16:08.181
Please, please talk
to her, will you?

16:08.182 --> 16:09.516
All right, Sam.

16:09.584 --> 16:13.420
Uh, Carla, look, I know what
you're going through.

16:13.421 --> 16:16.189
I mean, you've sacrificed
your whole life for your kids

16:16.190 --> 16:17.841
and now, on the big day,

16:17.842 --> 16:19.977
Nick swoops in and tries
to hog all the glory.

16:19.978 --> 16:21.418
Look, it happens all the time.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.310
One parent uses the child as
leverage against the other.

16:24.316 --> 16:26.016
Really, Doc?
Oh yes, yes.

16:26.084 --> 16:29.086
Often in a broken marriage
the child becomes nothing more

16:29.154 --> 16:32.423
than, a helpless pawn in the
war between the two adults.

16:32.424 --> 16:34.825
Of course that hasn't happened
with, with Lilith and myself

16:34.826 --> 16:36.394
because she's gone.

16:36.461 --> 16:39.597
But, uh, she'll be back.

16:40.932 --> 16:44.050
Oh, I know she'll be
back, you know why?

16:44.118 --> 16:45.819
'Cause I have Frederick.

16:46.587 --> 16:47.738
Yes, sir,

16:47.806 --> 16:50.807
he's my little trump card.

16:50.875 --> 16:51.925
Thank you very much.

16:51.976 --> 16:53.076
He is, you know.

16:53.144 --> 16:54.311
I have a plan.

16:54.379 --> 16:55.713
(laughs evilly)

16:57.515 --> 16:59.266
You're Nick, right?

16:59.267 --> 17:00.367
Yes.

17:00.368 --> 17:01.602
I'm Rebecca Howe.

17:01.670 --> 17:03.404
I work here
in the bar with Carla.

17:03.471 --> 17:05.972
And I just want to say
you must be very proud.

17:06.040 --> 17:08.242
Oh I'm very proud.
Yes.

17:08.310 --> 17:10.609
I know the last thing
that I would want to do

17:10.678 --> 17:12.546
is introduce a dark note,

17:12.613 --> 17:15.866
but if you don't get your hand off
my butt, you're gonna lose it.

17:16.654 --> 17:20.037
NORM:
Sammy, how'd it go in there?

17:20.038 --> 17:21.104
Oh, not good.

17:21.105 --> 17:22.906
She refuses to come out.
I don't know...

17:22.907 --> 17:25.476
Don't worry about it, Sam.
I'll handle it.

17:25.544 --> 17:28.211
Carla, at times,
can be very obdurate.

17:29.714 --> 17:32.783
She also can be
very recalcitrant,

17:32.851 --> 17:38.488
intransigent and immovable.

17:38.556 --> 17:42.292
Nicky got one of those
word-a-day calendars.

17:42.360 --> 17:45.362
We played word games
all the way from Las Vegas.

17:45.464 --> 17:47.097
I'm insipid.

17:51.118 --> 17:52.836
Carla.
Go home, Nick.

17:52.837 --> 17:54.204
You don't deserve to be here.

17:54.205 --> 17:57.574
Carla, listen, I, I understand
your feelings very well.

17:57.575 --> 18:00.010
I know some people probably
thought I was a bad father

18:00.011 --> 18:03.180
and maybe I was and maybe I
wasn't, and maybe I was.

18:05.049 --> 18:07.884
I speak to you from the bottom
of my heart and guts,

18:07.952 --> 18:10.187
that these last few years
without family

18:10.254 --> 18:12.122
has been very empty for me.

18:12.190 --> 18:13.557
All I've had is Loretta.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.058
No offence.

18:15.126 --> 18:17.227
None taken.

18:17.295 --> 18:22.933
I've come to learn that the most
important thing is family.

18:23.001 --> 18:25.002
Yeah, I know,
I come at this late date

18:25.003 --> 18:26.270
for Serafina's wedding,

18:26.271 --> 18:28.201
but I thought
it would be a first step,

18:28.240 --> 18:30.608
in realigning myself
with my offspring

18:30.675 --> 18:33.594
and them becoming truly
a paternity figure.

18:33.662 --> 18:36.480
So you want to be a father.

18:36.548 --> 18:38.915
You want to get back
in your kids' lives, huh?

18:38.983 --> 18:40.851
Absolutely.

18:40.918 --> 18:42.052
Come over here.

18:42.119 --> 18:43.487
Let's go.

18:46.658 --> 18:48.091
Over here we have...

18:48.159 --> 18:50.494
ten kids.

18:50.562 --> 18:52.529
Some of them are yours.

18:52.597 --> 18:56.316
Identify three,
and you can stay.

18:56.383 --> 18:58.885
Otherwise you're out of here.

18:58.953 --> 19:00.386
Is this a test?

19:00.454 --> 19:02.422
You're stalling.

19:02.490 --> 19:07.060
Give me some time
to gather my momentum.

19:07.061 --> 19:08.495
So, Miss Howe,
we've got five minutes.

19:08.496 --> 19:09.830
You want to tear one off?

19:09.897 --> 19:11.515
That's mine!

19:14.953 --> 19:17.755
Okay, that's one.

19:31.102 --> 19:33.103
Hugo, my beloved.

19:33.171 --> 19:34.238
Hugo.

19:34.306 --> 19:36.574
Sorry, Nick, that's
not your kid.

19:36.641 --> 19:39.459
You know you people
could help me.

19:39.460 --> 19:40.878
FRASIER:
I wouldn't be much good.

19:40.879 --> 19:44.681
I thought your last
selection was correct.

19:44.749 --> 19:46.366
Uh, I think it's about time.

19:46.433 --> 19:47.901
Let's start the ceremony.

19:47.969 --> 19:50.003
Oh, that's Serafina.
She's one of mine.

19:50.071 --> 19:51.538
Aw, forget it Nick.

19:51.605 --> 19:54.341
Let's face it,
you can't do this.

19:54.408 --> 19:56.376
Aw... Loretta.
Hit the road.

19:56.377 --> 19:58.979
Go on, kids, go on upstairs and
get ready for the ceremony.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.113
Come on, let's go.

20:00.181 --> 20:01.865
What's happening?

20:01.933 --> 20:04.651
Your mother doesn't
feel I belong here.

20:04.719 --> 20:07.153
She says I'm unwelcome.

20:07.221 --> 20:09.907
Mother, you can't
send Daddy away

20:09.975 --> 20:11.909
on the most important
day of my life.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.477
Listen, Serafina,
you've gotta understand...

20:13.478 --> 20:15.228
No, this is not about you.

20:15.296 --> 20:19.349
It's about me-
my wedding, my day.

20:19.417 --> 20:21.785
Have a nice life, baby.

20:21.852 --> 20:23.387
Wait one minute, Daddy.

20:25.272 --> 20:28.375
Look, Ma, I know all the
things you've done for me.

20:28.443 --> 20:29.909
I know you don't like Daddy,

20:29.977 --> 20:32.212
but like him or not,
he is my dad.

20:32.279 --> 20:34.931
I know he's been
a bad father...

20:34.999 --> 20:36.633
never around when you need him,

20:36.701 --> 20:39.336
a louse, a jerk,

20:39.404 --> 20:42.005
a liar, a deadbeat.

20:42.073 --> 20:43.390
You tell her, honey.

20:46.126 --> 20:48.296
You know, all my life
I've always pictured

20:48.346 --> 20:51.247
that someday I would
walk down the aisle

20:51.315 --> 20:54.785
on my father's arm,
just like any other girl.

20:54.853 --> 20:58.572
Not like every
other girl, Serafina.

20:58.639 --> 21:00.741
My father wasn't
there to give me away.

21:00.808 --> 21:02.593
And how'd that make
you feel, Mom?

21:04.729 --> 21:07.865
Pretty rotten.

21:07.932 --> 21:10.517
Sayonara, Serafina.

21:10.585 --> 21:12.802
Oh wait, Nick.

21:12.870 --> 21:14.204
You can stay.

21:14.272 --> 21:16.957
Really?
Thanks, Mom.

21:17.024 --> 21:18.459
Look, you, listen...

21:18.526 --> 21:22.145
you do anything to ruin
my lovely daughter's wedding,

21:22.213 --> 21:25.315
and I will choke you
until your eyes bug out.

21:26.918 --> 21:29.336
(voice breaking):
It's just like The Waltons.

21:31.940 --> 21:34.674
LORETTA: ♪ What are you doing
the rest of your life? ♪

21:34.742 --> 21:38.528
♪ North and south and east
and west of your life? ♪

21:38.596 --> 21:42.298
♪ I have only one request
of your life... ♪

21:42.366 --> 21:44.752
Carla, look at
our kid out there.

21:44.819 --> 21:48.055
She's pregnant, married
to a retired cop.

21:48.123 --> 21:50.324
We must have done
something right.

21:50.391 --> 21:52.509
Yeah.

21:52.510 --> 21:54.745
Maybe our other kids
will turn out okay, too.

21:54.746 --> 21:56.613
That is my most fervent wish.

21:56.681 --> 21:58.281
(phone ringing)

21:58.349 --> 22:00.417
Cheers.

22:00.484 --> 22:01.551
Oh, just a second.

22:01.619 --> 22:02.986
Mr. Tortelli,
it's for you.

22:03.054 --> 22:04.871
For me?

22:04.939 --> 22:07.140
Hello.

22:07.208 --> 22:09.009
What?

22:11.279 --> 22:12.879
What? When?

22:12.880 --> 22:14.514
(yelling):
All right, I'll be on it!

22:14.515 --> 22:15.748
Loretta, let's go!

22:15.816 --> 22:17.500
WOODY:
What's the matter?

22:17.501 --> 22:19.619
One of the orang-utans
went nuts and bit a kid.

22:19.620 --> 22:22.255
I've got to rush to Vegas
before they put him to sleep.

22:22.256 --> 22:23.516
The orang-utan or the kid?

22:23.541 --> 22:24.942
I didn't ask.

22:27.845 --> 22:30.180
Thanks again
for everything, Mom.

22:30.248 --> 22:31.615
I'm happy.

22:31.683 --> 22:35.285
Serafina, I really
want to apologize

22:35.353 --> 22:37.554
for the way I acted
this afternoon.

22:37.622 --> 22:42.825
And I promise I'll be on my best
behaviour at your next wedding.

22:42.893 --> 22:46.396
Oh, Ma.
