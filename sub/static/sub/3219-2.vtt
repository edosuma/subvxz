Those seals are being broken by Lilith.

37:39.131 --> 37:40.840
She did the spell,
she rose the witnesses?

37:41.008 --> 37:44.135
Mm-hm. And not just here.

37:44.303 --> 37:46.554
-Twenty other hunters are dead.
-Of course.

37:46.722 --> 37:48.890
She picked victims
the hunters couldn't save.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.184
So that they would
barrel right after us.

37:51.352 --> 37:55.021
-Lilith has a certain sense of humor.
-We put those spirits back to rest.

37:55.189 --> 37:57.524
Doesn't matter. The seal was broken.

37:58.401 --> 38:00.735
Why break the seal, anyway?

38:00.903 --> 38:03.154
You think of the seals
as locks on a door.

38:04.532 --> 38:06.032
Okay. Last one opens and...?

38:11.205 --> 38:13.164
Lucifer walks free.

38:18.170 --> 38:19.921
Lucifer?

38:20.131 --> 38:24.884
I thought Lucifer was just a story
they told at demon Sunday school.

38:25.052 --> 38:26.261
There's no such thing.

38:26.762 --> 38:29.723
Three days ago, you thought
there was no such thing as me.

38:33.227 --> 38:35.729
Why do you think we're here,
walking among you now...

38:35.896 --> 38:38.231
...for the first time in 2000 years?

38:40.067 --> 38:41.276
To stop Lucifer.

38:43.195 --> 38:45.071
It's why we've arrived.

38:47.450 --> 38:51.911
Well, bang-up job so far.

38:52.079 --> 38:55.081
Stellar work with the witnesses.
It's nice.

38:57.418 --> 38:59.794
We tried.

39:00.421 --> 39:02.714
There are other battles.

39:02.882 --> 39:06.092
Other seals.
Some we'll win, some we'll lose.

39:06.260 --> 39:07.802
This one we lost.

39:07.970 --> 39:09.387
[SCOFFS]

39:12.391 --> 39:15.310
Our numbers are not unlimited.

39:16.979 --> 39:20.148
Six of my brothers died
in the field this week.

39:20.316 --> 39:25.278
You think the armies of heaven
should just follow you around?

39:26.197 --> 39:28.740
There's a bigger picture here.

39:32.953 --> 39:35.580
You should show me some respect.

39:36.791 --> 39:41.628
I dragged you out of hell.
I can throw you back in.

39:48.844 --> 39:50.303
[GASPS]

40:01.857 --> 40:04.651
Ha. You all right?

40:05.820 --> 40:07.654
What's wrong, Dean?

40:09.740 --> 40:14.327
So, ahem,
you got no problem believing...

40:14.495 --> 40:15.870
...in God and angels?

40:17.498 --> 40:19.457
No, not really.

40:22.336 --> 40:25.004
So I guess that means
you believe in the devil.

40:26.465 --> 40:28.758
Why are you asking me all this?

41:07.715 --> 41:09.716
