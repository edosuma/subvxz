WEBVTT

00:00.070 --> 00:02.695
Good morning, everyone.

00:03.542 --> 00:05.742
Good morning.

00:05.744 --> 00:07.201
Okay, let's focus up.

00:09.548 --> 00:11.014
Quiet!

00:11.937 --> 00:13.178
Morning, everyone.

00:13.179 --> 00:16.786
Okay, uh, before the new
district manager gets here,

00:16.788 --> 00:21.324
I just wanted to warn you
her name is Laurie Neustadt.

00:21.326 --> 00:22.312
And she's a woman,

00:22.313 --> 00:24.971
so let's not act like that's weird.

00:24.972 --> 00:26.645
Um, is it weird?

00:26.645 --> 00:27.951
No. I mean...

00:28.800 --> 00:30.662
just don't act like anything's weird.

00:30.982 --> 00:32.534
Ever. In general.

00:32.537 --> 00:34.992
- Nice recovery.
- Man, I hope she's a WILF.

00:35.707 --> 00:37.640
It's a woman I'd like to [bleep].

00:37.642 --> 00:39.175
That's what that means.

00:39.177 --> 00:41.311
I'm excited to have a woman in charge.

00:41.313 --> 00:43.713
The world's moving too fast.

00:43.715 --> 00:45.079
Enough already.

00:45.188 --> 00:48.017
I'm just worried that
I'm gonna say something weird.

00:48.019 --> 00:49.819
I wish I knew something more about her.

00:49.821 --> 00:52.215
I'm Googling her, and
apparently she's from Denver.

00:52.216 --> 00:54.757
Denver, terrific.
Let's go with the Denver thing.

00:54.759 --> 00:57.060
Or we could just treat her
like she's a human being.

00:57.062 --> 00:58.361
Yeah, but we've got the Denver thing

00:58.363 --> 00:59.738
in case that doesn't work out.

00:59.739 --> 01:01.498
Right, and why wouldn't that work?

01:01.500 --> 01:02.926
Okay, she's here. Places, everyone!

01:02.927 --> 01:03.985
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:04.048 --> 01:05.614
What?

01:05.804 --> 01:06.681
Now I'm ready.

01:06.682 --> 01:08.592
- Hey, everyone.
- Milady.

01:10.393 --> 01:12.122
Okay. Um, hi.

01:12.123 --> 01:13.443
I am Laurie Neustadt.

01:13.445 --> 01:14.556
I'm taking over for Jeff.

01:14.557 --> 01:16.157
I'm gonna be here all
day walking around,

01:16.158 --> 01:17.881
getting to know the store,
trying to figure out ways

01:17.883 --> 01:19.449
we can make things
a little more efficient.

01:19.451 --> 01:22.485
So, um, busy day.
Let's, uh, get back out there.

01:22.487 --> 01:23.907
Let's get back out there.

01:24.389 --> 01:27.195
Bet they say that a lot
on the slopes of Denver, huh?

01:28.193 --> 01:28.967
I guess. I...

01:32.548 --> 01:35.231
Actually, I think this is
a different Laurie Neustadt.

01:37.791 --> 01:40.964
Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

01:43.608 --> 01:45.775
Laurie seems like
kind of a bitch, right?

01:45.777 --> 01:47.844
She's like this strict
schoolteacher in a porn

01:47.846 --> 01:49.312
but nothing good ends up happening.

01:49.314 --> 01:50.947
She just, like, teaches.

01:50.949 --> 01:52.849
Yeah, and her shoes made a lot of noise.

01:52.851 --> 01:53.950
I mean, what?

01:53.952 --> 01:57.720
Are you guys seriously
weirded out by a female boss?

01:57.722 --> 01:59.428
It's 2018.

02:00.353 --> 02:01.191
You're right.

02:01.193 --> 02:02.407
To be honest, I really liked her shoes.

02:02.408 --> 02:05.960
You know, a lot of people think
women make better bosses than men.

02:06.274 --> 02:08.512
It's like they say, uh...
Ginger Rogers did everything

02:08.513 --> 02:10.779
Fred Astaire did but
backwards and in high heels.

02:10.781 --> 02:12.481
That's total crap.

02:12.483 --> 02:14.495
When did Ginger dance backwards?

02:15.152 --> 02:17.886
Oh, uh, it's just an expression.

02:17.888 --> 02:20.722
They danced in circles or side by side.

02:20.724 --> 02:23.425
You're only defending her
because she's a woman.

02:23.764 --> 02:24.744
That's sexism.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.328
If she was a man, there's no way we'd be

02:26.330 --> 02:28.263
standing around talking
about her appearance.

02:28.265 --> 02:29.264
Exactly.

02:29.266 --> 02:31.833
Name one picture where
Ginger Rogers was better

02:31.835 --> 02:32.957
than Rita Hayworth.

02:33.470 --> 02:34.835
I don't know any.

02:34.836 --> 02:36.711
Ginger Rogers was nothing.

02:37.922 --> 02:39.173
Come on, man.

02:39.476 --> 02:40.903
"Big Time." "Top Hat."

02:41.221 --> 02:42.587
"Swinging Down to Rio."

02:42.746 --> 02:43.955
You froze up, dude.

02:45.000 --> 02:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:52.022 --> 02:53.622
Ugh, Laurie's gonna be
looking at our stats,

02:53.624 --> 02:55.524
and my checkout scores are terrible.

02:55.526 --> 02:57.322
That scanner never works for me.

02:57.694 --> 02:58.994
It's probably because
I swallowed a magnet

02:58.996 --> 03:00.028
when I was four.

03:00.030 --> 03:01.129
It just never came out.

03:01.130 --> 03:03.465
Who cares if you're bad at one thing?

03:03.467 --> 03:05.167
I'm bad at driving, but I'm good

03:05.169 --> 03:06.434
at texting and driving.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.720
My UPM score is a five.

03:08.721 --> 03:11.239
A five? Even I got a 30.

03:11.241 --> 03:12.908
Well, you have better
hand-eye coordination.

03:12.910 --> 03:15.210
I can't be wasting my time
playing "Star Trek" video games

03:15.212 --> 03:16.945
- all day.
- Uh, it's "Star Wars."

03:16.947 --> 03:19.614
Same diff. They're just
ugly people floating in space.

03:19.616 --> 03:20.682
Yeah, they're not floating in space.

03:20.683 --> 03:22.221
They're on planets most of the time.

03:22.222 --> 03:24.073
That's just an ignorant comment.

03:25.722 --> 03:26.988
Oh, excuse me,

03:26.990 --> 03:27.989
you're the floor manager, right?

03:27.991 --> 03:29.291
Uh, yeah, hi. Amy.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.626
Hi. Um, there is an employee,

03:31.628 --> 03:34.296
Sal Kazlauskas, who has a lot of open

03:34.298 --> 03:36.198
sexual harassment
complaints against him.

03:36.200 --> 03:38.366
Yeah, it's fine. He died in the wall.

03:38.368 --> 03:39.868
- That's this store?
- Mm-hmm.

03:39.870 --> 03:41.297
Okay, good to know. Thank you.

03:41.375 --> 03:42.581
Yeah, anytime.

03:43.674 --> 03:47.309
Hey, um, can I just say, it's...
it's really cool to have

03:47.311 --> 03:48.710
a woman district manager.

03:48.712 --> 03:50.455
I mean, it's about time, right?

03:50.456 --> 03:52.147
Thank you. Well, I had to have sex

03:52.149 --> 03:54.849
with a lot of board members
to get here, so...

03:55.619 --> 03:57.182
I'm kidding.

03:57.183 --> 03:59.154
No, I didn't...

03:59.156 --> 04:00.388
I mean, I wouldn't...

04:00.929 --> 04:04.663
Anyway, uh, if I can, you know, give
you a hand with anything, let me know.

04:04.665 --> 04:05.595
Oh, actually, you know what?

04:05.596 --> 04:08.853
I would love some help with some
of these personnel details.

04:09.266 --> 04:12.166
Oh, uh, yeah. Okay, sure.

04:12.569 --> 04:15.403
Arby's has the meats,
but Amy's got the deets.

04:16.404 --> 04:18.839
- I'm sorry. That was weird.
- That was weird.

04:19.288 --> 04:21.500
Hey, I just wanted to make
sure we're on the same page

04:21.503 --> 04:24.613
about keeping this whole
situation from Laurie.

04:24.615 --> 04:26.942
Oh, 'cause you're not married.

04:27.217 --> 04:28.198
What? No.

04:28.199 --> 04:29.977
I just mean a lot of
bosses don't like preggos.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.921
What? No, everyone loves preggos.

04:32.923 --> 04:34.204
It's like the saying.

04:34.205 --> 04:36.623
Everyone likes preggos,
LEGOs, and Eggos.

04:36.701 --> 04:38.393
Not me. If I hear someone's pregnant,

04:38.395 --> 04:39.995
all I think about is bathroom breaks

04:39.997 --> 04:41.896
and doctors' appointments and hormones.

04:41.898 --> 04:43.365
It's like, we don't need another Elias.

04:43.367 --> 04:45.400
Okay, but Laurie's gonna
find out eventually.

04:45.402 --> 04:47.002
Well, we'll deal with that
if it comes to it,

04:47.004 --> 04:48.803
but for all we know, I may lose the baby

04:48.805 --> 04:49.938
and this is never even an issue.

04:49.940 --> 04:51.306
Wait, what?

04:51.308 --> 04:52.715
I'm just saying, things happen.

04:52.716 --> 04:54.209
I live in a very dangerous neighborhood.

04:54.211 --> 04:55.910
People are always pushing other people.

04:55.912 --> 04:57.694
Anyway...

04:57.695 --> 04:58.622
Later, boss.

04:59.082 --> 05:01.393
Move! You've gotta move.

05:01.818 --> 05:04.986
We try and keep Carol and Sandra
on opposite sides of the store.

05:04.988 --> 05:07.689
It's sort of like a...
like a Crips and Bloods thing.

05:07.691 --> 05:09.357
And Justine Sikowicz?

05:09.359 --> 05:10.725
Justine is a hard worker.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.794
Um, she cries a lot in the bathroom.

05:12.796 --> 05:14.829
But not, like, in a way
where you feel like you have

05:14.831 --> 05:16.865
- to go in.
- Got it, okay.

05:16.867 --> 05:18.566
Uh, Myrtle Vartanian?

05:18.568 --> 05:21.269
Oh, Myrtle, yeah. She's sweet.

05:21.271 --> 05:24.340
She doesn't do very much.
Doesn't do it very well, but...

05:24.341 --> 05:27.707
She actually makes more money
than anyone else at her level.

05:28.779 --> 05:31.313
Yeah, well, I guess when
you've been here that long,

05:31.315 --> 05:34.049
even 40-cent pay bumps add up, huh?

05:34.051 --> 05:35.022
Good to know.

05:35.023 --> 05:37.357
All right, well, at least
we know we can cut Myrtle.

05:37.358 --> 05:39.054
Okay, why don't you tell me about Cody?

05:39.056 --> 05:42.667
Oh, wait, uh, sorry. Um,
when you say cut Myrtle,

05:42.926 --> 05:44.119
you don't mean like...

05:44.120 --> 05:45.560
Oh, my God, no.
I'm not, like, a monster.

05:45.562 --> 05:47.395
Oh, okay. Phew.

05:47.397 --> 05:49.664
I'm not, like, gonna literally cut her.

05:49.666 --> 05:53.134
- No, I just mean fire her.
- Oh, um...

05:53.136 --> 05:54.993
Okay, tell me about Marcus White.

05:55.372 --> 05:57.405
What's his IQ?
Because if it's low enough,

05:57.407 --> 05:58.907
we get a tax break.

06:05.253 --> 06:08.728
So out of the blue, she just
decided to fire Myrtle?

06:08.752 --> 06:09.441
Exactly.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.185
Yeah, that's exactly what happened.

06:11.187 --> 06:12.587
There has to be a reason.

06:12.589 --> 06:13.855
Well, I don't know. I just met her.

06:13.857 --> 06:15.853
I don't know what's inside of her mind.

06:16.426 --> 06:18.461
I think you do know.

06:18.962 --> 06:19.720
Okay, fine.

06:20.396 --> 06:22.296
I might have mentioned
that Myrtle is not

06:22.298 --> 06:23.564
very good at her job.

06:23.566 --> 06:25.466
What? Why would you say that?

06:25.468 --> 06:27.034
Because she asked me about Myrtle.

06:27.036 --> 06:29.666
So you led with, "Myrtle's
not good at her job"?

06:29.667 --> 06:32.006
No, I led with, "She's very sweet",

06:32.008 --> 06:34.084
and she's not very good at her job."

06:34.644 --> 06:36.144
I don't know. We were bonding.

06:36.356 --> 06:37.578
Are we gonna stand around
and just point fingers,

06:37.580 --> 06:38.980
or are you gonna help me fix this?

06:38.982 --> 06:40.681
I was thinking we could point fingers

06:40.683 --> 06:41.970
for a few more minutes.

06:42.097 --> 06:43.663
Myrtle's a fixture.

06:43.853 --> 06:46.020
I mean, would you want me
to fire the light bulbs

06:46.022 --> 06:50.391
or to... would you want me to throw
our plumbing out into the cold?

06:50.393 --> 06:53.272
I would, if the pipes cost us
more than any other pipe

06:53.273 --> 06:54.643
for doing inferior work.

06:54.931 --> 06:56.831
Look, I'm sure she will
find another job, Glenn.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.366
Who's gonna hire her?

06:58.368 --> 06:59.883
She's useless.

07:00.804 --> 07:03.146
Can I at least wait
until the end of the day?

07:03.807 --> 07:06.374
I would like to show her
one last perfect day

07:06.376 --> 07:08.943
before she wanders off
into the great unknown.

07:08.945 --> 07:12.041
Okay, I'm asking you
to fire her, not kill her.

07:12.749 --> 07:14.561
How do you live with yourself?

07:20.323 --> 07:22.924
Is sighing really gonna
help me go faster?

07:22.926 --> 07:24.293
You're just wasting air.

07:32.635 --> 07:34.502
There, how do you like it?

07:34.504 --> 07:36.170
I just can't make it work.

07:36.172 --> 07:38.506
Okay, I-I don't know how you
check out people so quickly.

07:38.508 --> 07:41.205
Why don't you just go into Glenn's
computer and change your stats?

07:41.205 --> 07:42.003
You can do that?

07:42.004 --> 07:43.477
You kidding me? I do it all the time.

07:43.479 --> 07:44.912
Why do you think I never work Fridays

07:44.914 --> 07:46.547
but get paid for Fridays?

07:47.637 --> 07:48.382
You think I should?

07:48.384 --> 07:50.318
Well, isn't that kind of like cheating?

07:50.320 --> 07:51.319
Not really.

07:51.321 --> 07:52.699
'Cause if you think about it...

07:52.701 --> 07:54.989
It's cheating. It's 100% cheating.

07:54.991 --> 07:56.591
I think Garrett makes a good point.

07:57.169 --> 07:57.892
I'm gonna do it.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.293
Well, I guess while you're in there,

07:59.295 --> 08:00.661
you can change your employee photo too.

08:00.663 --> 08:02.129
Enough about the photo!

08:02.131 --> 08:04.131
I had a lot of sodium that morning.

08:04.378 --> 08:07.267
I just get nervous if I go too
tight, it'll hurt the baby.

08:07.270 --> 08:09.170
Women have been wearing
corsets for centuries.

08:09.172 --> 08:10.118
If a little squeezing hurt,

08:10.118 --> 08:11.954
I think we would have heard
something about it.

08:11.955 --> 08:14.375
There used to be really
high infant mortality.

08:14.377 --> 08:15.977
Fine, I'll go get Justine to help.

08:15.979 --> 08:16.982
No, no!

08:17.413 --> 08:19.048
I'll do it. I can do it.

08:19.849 --> 08:20.521
Okay.

08:24.621 --> 08:27.188
Oh, it's pretty tight. I don't know.

08:27.190 --> 08:28.545
Sandra, I swear to God.

08:29.292 --> 08:30.725
Why don't you just
tell Laurie you're fat?

08:30.727 --> 08:32.393
Because fat people are fat everywhere.

08:32.395 --> 08:34.022
This is clearly a baby bump.

08:34.023 --> 08:35.496
We could pad you all over,

08:35.808 --> 08:36.931
like how they do Hollywood actors.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.554
Eddie Murphy, Martin Lawrence,
Tyler Perry.

08:40.410 --> 08:43.053
I am not intentionally
just naming black actors.

08:43.053 --> 08:44.605
Sandra, if I didn't need
your Hulu password,

08:44.607 --> 08:46.053
I would kill you right now.

08:46.843 --> 08:49.729
Myrtle, what would be
your idea of a perfect day?

08:50.914 --> 08:53.281
I guess I'd like to spend one more day

08:53.283 --> 08:55.016
with my late husband, Charlie.

08:55.018 --> 08:59.096
Oh, okay, but what about
a perfect day in the store?

08:59.698 --> 09:01.522
If Charlie came in the store.

09:01.524 --> 09:02.990
Okay, I'm not God.

09:02.992 --> 09:05.493
Hey, Myrtle, you borrowed some
scissors, and I need them back.

09:05.495 --> 09:06.836
You leave her alone!

09:07.163 --> 09:08.729
This is Myrtle's day!

09:09.096 --> 09:11.398
You take all the scissors
you want, honey.

09:11.935 --> 09:14.702
Hey, Laurie, um, can we talk to you?

09:14.704 --> 09:15.903
Sure, who's this?

09:15.905 --> 09:18.357
Hi, um, I'm Jonah. Simms.

09:18.574 --> 09:20.885
Mm, he does look like a male Tinkerbell.

09:22.278 --> 09:23.678
Uh, you can't fire Myrtle.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.780
She is an invaluable
asset to this store.

09:25.782 --> 09:29.083
Okay, Amy, I really don't
want to fire anyone, right?

09:29.085 --> 09:30.685
Certainly not a sweet old lady,

09:30.687 --> 09:32.367
but corporate is on me
to cut the budget.

09:32.368 --> 09:33.921
What if we found the savings elsewhere?

09:33.923 --> 09:35.489
Could she keep her job then?

09:35.491 --> 09:36.861
She makes $20 bucks an hour.

09:37.014 --> 09:37.759
Myrtle?

09:39.429 --> 09:41.269
Dude, yeah, no, that makes sense.

09:41.417 --> 09:44.665
It's nice to see a woman not just
making 79 cents on the dollar.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.021
We can find those savings.

09:46.022 --> 09:48.235
I just cut my own home
budget down simply by going

09:48.237 --> 09:50.004
to the library when I need the Internet,

09:50.006 --> 09:52.664
so if we do it, can she keep her job?

09:53.057 --> 09:54.227
Sure, yeah.

09:54.868 --> 09:55.843
Give it a try.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.557
- All right.
- Thank you.

09:58.435 --> 09:59.681
Tinkerbell.

10:00.516 --> 10:02.570
I don't know where she heard that.

10:04.381 --> 10:05.815
I... It's tough.

10:05.966 --> 10:07.796
Come on, you went to business school.

10:07.796 --> 10:09.838
Can't you just track down
some wasteful spending?

10:09.839 --> 10:13.053
It's not like there's a line
item for wasteful spending.

10:13.491 --> 10:16.750
Well, let's think outside the box or

10:16.752 --> 10:17.837
cut the pork.

10:17.837 --> 10:19.262
Like, that's a thing, right?

10:19.747 --> 10:21.109
Those are words, yes.

10:21.437 --> 10:23.619
Come on, Jonah. You can do this!

10:23.620 --> 10:25.887
I know you can do this. Come on, baby!

10:26.115 --> 10:27.355
Find the money!

10:27.357 --> 10:28.803
Show Mama the money.

10:28.804 --> 10:32.293
O-okay, all right, okay,
I appreciate the energy, Mama.

10:32.512 --> 10:33.945
But can you let me focus?

10:34.252 --> 10:36.080
Yeah, okay, whatever you need.

10:36.082 --> 10:38.883
Well, okay, we leave
the A/C on in March.

10:38.885 --> 10:40.451
It's just competing with the heat.

10:40.453 --> 10:41.553
If we turn both of them off,

10:41.555 --> 10:43.919
that would save us $200.

10:44.457 --> 10:46.491
Yes, okay!

10:46.493 --> 10:49.476
Mama smells the bacon
'cause Papa found the pork!

10:49.796 --> 10:52.931
- 200 bucks!
- I don't like any of this.

10:53.171 --> 10:55.137
Neither do I, but Mama can't stop.

10:55.138 --> 10:56.195
Okay.

10:57.604 --> 10:58.937
Why are you shutting the blinds?

10:58.939 --> 11:00.569
So no one can see us.

11:00.570 --> 11:02.807
Oh, you're afraid we might get caught

11:02.809 --> 11:04.582
changing your register scores?

11:04.945 --> 11:08.233
Fine. Can we just change the
scores so we can get out of here?

11:08.234 --> 11:10.281
All right, I'm just looking
for the right window.

11:10.283 --> 11:12.050
Glenn's taxes,

11:12.052 --> 11:15.053
Google search for how many
tomatoes in the world,

11:15.055 --> 11:16.688
his church's MySpace page.

11:16.905 --> 11:19.958
Ah, here we are. Employee records.

11:19.960 --> 11:23.000
- Okay.
- Your UPM score is now 120.

11:24.167 --> 11:26.264
120? Isn't that kinda high?

11:26.266 --> 11:27.765
I don't know, man. I mean, we're here.

11:27.767 --> 11:29.867
You might as well change it
to something impressive.

11:30.101 --> 11:30.738
You're right.

11:30.919 --> 11:32.370
This is my Tonya Harding moment,

11:32.372 --> 11:34.472
and I've gotta claw my way to the top.

11:34.742 --> 11:35.707
Okay.

11:36.977 --> 11:37.813
121.

11:39.112 --> 11:40.549
It's a little less obvious.

11:45.018 --> 11:46.217
Excuse me, young lady.

11:46.219 --> 11:47.719
Do you have any sugar?

11:47.721 --> 11:50.616
My coffee is black with
an 80% chance of cream.

11:51.053 --> 11:52.051
There you go.

11:53.994 --> 11:56.294
Oh, my goodness. Myrtle, look.

11:56.296 --> 12:00.649
Isn't that Channel 4 weatherman
Skipper Sailes in our very store?

12:01.768 --> 12:04.168
I don't know. I watch Channel 5

12:04.170 --> 12:05.470
with Craig Moeller.

12:05.678 --> 12:07.138
Oh. O-okay.

12:07.140 --> 12:09.807
I could have sworn you said Channel 4.

12:09.809 --> 12:10.746
Hey, it's cool.

12:11.311 --> 12:12.120
Craig's great.

12:12.121 --> 12:13.663
Really good at what he does.

12:14.381 --> 12:15.719
Craig's the best.

12:18.752 --> 12:20.553
So, uh, Glenn,

12:21.087 --> 12:23.287
maybe you can just reimburse
me for the coffee now.

12:23.289 --> 12:24.463
Yeah, later.

12:24.541 --> 12:26.424
Yeah, it's just otherwise,
I need to submit it

12:26.426 --> 12:29.059
- to the station as a...
- I said later, Skipper Sailes!

12:32.732 --> 12:34.832
Hey, you're Dina, right?

12:34.834 --> 12:36.063
- Uh...
- The assistant manager?

12:36.064 --> 12:37.047
Huh? What?

12:37.524 --> 12:38.335
Ah...

12:39.105 --> 12:41.773
I have a quick question
about the shrink reports.

12:41.775 --> 12:43.574
Sure, shoot.

12:43.576 --> 12:44.709
Do you wanna put the box down?

12:44.711 --> 12:46.277
No, it's light.

12:47.514 --> 12:49.681
Okay. Uh, well, it says that shrink

12:49.683 --> 12:53.257
accounted for, like,
1.4% of total sales last month.

12:53.853 --> 12:56.087
But at the same time,
the regional average

12:56.089 --> 12:57.088
- actually dropped.
- Mm...

12:57.090 --> 12:57.647
Mm-hmm.

12:57.702 --> 12:59.787
Now, starting in the month of...

13:01.761 --> 13:03.818
Hang on. August...

13:03.819 --> 13:05.042
Just ask the question!

13:05.855 --> 13:07.365
So sorry. I, uh... hoo!

13:07.367 --> 13:09.333
Just have to, uh, use the restroom.

13:09.335 --> 13:11.502
So maybe we can discuss that later.

13:11.806 --> 13:13.905
Okay, great. You know what?
I have to go too, so I'll tag along.

13:13.907 --> 13:14.974
Great.

13:15.062 --> 13:17.542
That's great.
Just, uh, follow me this way.

13:19.411 --> 13:20.411
You're bringing the kettlebells

13:20.413 --> 13:21.640
- to the bathroom?
- Yes, I am.

13:21.641 --> 13:23.496
They help me.

13:24.898 --> 13:27.852
Okay, if we got rid
of break room coffee,

13:27.854 --> 13:29.821
we would save another $300 a year.

13:29.823 --> 13:32.421
Great, let's take it.
That would put us over $8,000.

13:32.892 --> 13:34.459
Hey, you guys taking the coffee?

13:34.605 --> 13:37.028
If we don't find enough
budget cuts to cover

13:37.030 --> 13:39.032
her salary, Laurie is gonna fire Myrtle.

13:39.033 --> 13:39.753
- Oh.
- What?

13:39.753 --> 13:40.333
Are you kidding?

13:40.334 --> 13:41.844
Wait, why would she fire Myrtle?

13:41.846 --> 13:43.701
Nobody knows. It's just random.

13:43.703 --> 13:44.769
It's because she's a bitch.

13:44.958 --> 13:45.976
Laurie, not Myrtle.

13:46.239 --> 13:48.604
Please, Jeff did all
kinds of crappy things,

13:48.604 --> 13:49.850
and no one ever called him a bitch.

13:49.851 --> 13:52.243
When Jeff changed the vendors
for the vending machine,

13:52.245 --> 13:55.413
you called him a [bleep].

13:55.415 --> 13:56.912
Yeah, well, that's because
the vending machine

13:56.912 --> 13:58.116
didn't have any Takis.

13:58.118 --> 13:59.984
Sorry, if Laurie is being a bitch,

13:59.986 --> 14:02.420
wouldn't the truly
sexist thing be for me

14:02.422 --> 14:03.955
to not call her a bitch?

14:03.957 --> 14:04.895
No, that's not the point.

14:04.896 --> 14:07.492
Actually, I think I kind
of agree with Marcus.

14:07.494 --> 14:08.493
- What?
- Yes!

14:08.495 --> 14:09.722
Red pill brothers.

14:09.723 --> 14:11.896
No, I just mean if we had true equality,

14:11.898 --> 14:14.031
you could call out women
for doing something terrible

14:14.033 --> 14:15.600
when they're doing something terrible.

14:15.602 --> 14:16.734
Like being a bitch.

14:16.736 --> 14:18.269
See, there's that word again.

14:18.271 --> 14:19.363
- Maybe let's not use that.
- Don't?

14:19.364 --> 14:21.439
Yeah, only women
can use the word "bitch,"

14:21.441 --> 14:23.304
'cause we took that word
back, right, ladies?

14:23.305 --> 14:25.143
No, bitch, the gays took that from you.

14:25.145 --> 14:26.811
Okay, I think we're off track.

14:26.813 --> 14:28.713
To be honest, I'm not sure
what on track would look like.

14:28.715 --> 14:31.349
Hey, if Hitler was a woman,
would you be defending Hitler?

14:31.351 --> 14:32.784
No, obviously not.

14:32.786 --> 14:34.652
What if Oprah hosted the Holocaust?

14:34.654 --> 14:36.705
I'm not sure one hosts a holocaust.

14:36.706 --> 14:38.389
Don't mansplain her.

14:38.391 --> 14:40.725
Okay, I'm not in favor of any holocaust,

14:40.727 --> 14:42.727
but if there was a holocaust, then yeah,

14:42.729 --> 14:44.495
Oprah's who I would want to host it.

14:44.497 --> 14:46.366
And I actually agree with that.

14:46.367 --> 14:47.097
- Mm-hmm.
- Me too.

14:47.098 --> 14:48.499
- Yeah.
- That's a really good...

14:48.501 --> 14:50.293
I think we solved sexism, guys.

14:51.704 --> 14:55.072
Myrtle, you've been with us a long time.

14:55.074 --> 14:58.248
And all good things must come to an end.

15:00.346 --> 15:03.088
Myrtle, I am trying to talk to you.

15:03.583 --> 15:06.383
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

15:07.110 --> 15:09.612
I just like looking at the trucks.

15:11.257 --> 15:14.187
I always wanted to drive one of those.

15:15.728 --> 15:16.865
All right, Myrtle.

15:16.866 --> 15:19.123
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

15:19.465 --> 15:20.040
Yep.

15:22.235 --> 15:24.101
Breaker 1-9.

15:24.103 --> 15:26.451
This is Myrtle the Turtle saying,

15:26.739 --> 15:28.639
keep it groovy.

15:28.641 --> 15:29.889
<i>Get off this channel.</i>

15:30.619 --> 15:33.911
Mateo, I've just been going
over everyone's UPM numbers.

15:33.913 --> 15:35.413
Your score's very impressive.

15:35.415 --> 15:36.495
Oh, really?

15:36.783 --> 15:38.816
Um, I thought it was just average.

15:38.818 --> 15:40.087
Maybe slightly above.

15:40.163 --> 15:42.053
But, uh, wow. Thank you.

15:42.055 --> 15:45.122
I mean, I've never seen 121 UPM before.

15:45.124 --> 15:47.592
121!

15:47.594 --> 15:49.283
That's so stupid.

15:50.420 --> 15:51.229
Good.

15:51.231 --> 15:52.396
Stupid good.

15:52.398 --> 15:53.631
I didn't even know that the lasers

15:53.633 --> 15:55.600
could read the bar codes that quickly.

15:55.602 --> 15:56.601
Wow.

15:56.602 --> 15:58.172
Hey, you know what would be a good idea?

15:58.173 --> 16:00.638
If Mateo did a demonstration
of his technique

16:00.640 --> 16:02.139
for the rest of us.

16:02.141 --> 16:04.192
- What?
- I love that idea.

16:04.193 --> 16:05.910
Okay, excellent. Yes.

16:05.912 --> 16:08.446
Let's meet, register one,
five minutes, okay?

16:08.448 --> 16:10.114
- Five minutes, we'll be there.
- See you there.

16:10.116 --> 16:11.220
O-okay.

16:12.352 --> 16:13.818
What was that?

16:13.820 --> 16:16.053
That's what happens
when you say that "Star Wars"

16:16.055 --> 16:18.155
and "Star Trek" are the same thing.

16:18.373 --> 16:21.259
What... so this whole thing is
just a setup because I insulted

16:21.261 --> 16:23.728
- your stupid space opera?
- Shh!

16:23.730 --> 16:24.729
Save your energy.

16:25.012 --> 16:25.683
Oh, God.

16:35.436 --> 16:38.832
- You're a good man.
- Look how good she's doing.

16:47.894 --> 16:49.511
Oh, that's my car.

16:50.511 --> 16:52.862
That's what I get for parking
outside the lines.

16:56.860 --> 16:57.960
Is this everyone?

16:57.961 --> 16:59.197
Should we wait for more people?

16:59.198 --> 17:00.727
Mm, nope. We're ready.

17:01.323 --> 17:02.607
Great.

17:03.801 --> 17:05.108
Just...

17:08.903 --> 17:09.673
Ooh.

17:10.502 --> 17:11.795
You don't wanna start with cold muscles.

17:11.796 --> 17:13.387
Hey, you look pretty warm to me.

17:13.387 --> 17:14.556
It's showtime, Mateo.

17:15.742 --> 17:16.520
Okay.

17:17.104 --> 17:17.906
Great.

17:19.011 --> 17:20.126
So, um...

17:21.313 --> 17:22.904
first thing is, um,

17:23.885 --> 17:25.184
check the equipment.

17:26.002 --> 17:26.682
So...

17:27.954 --> 17:31.223
Oh. Ah, looks like it's broken.

17:31.225 --> 17:32.504
You just turned it off.

17:32.927 --> 17:33.836
Here.

17:35.620 --> 17:36.884
Thank you, Cheyenne.

17:38.299 --> 17:41.746
So now we begin.

17:52.813 --> 17:54.046
- Bees!
- What?

17:54.048 --> 17:55.588
Oh, I got stung!

17:56.179 --> 17:57.078
Bees!

17:57.151 --> 17:59.818
Killer bees! Killer bees!

17:59.820 --> 18:02.104
Get out of the store!
There's killer bees!

18:02.105 --> 18:03.195
Get out!

18:03.196 --> 18:03.978
Get out!

18:04.392 --> 18:05.617
Killer bees!

18:16.353 --> 18:17.803
This red area here

18:17.805 --> 18:20.659
represents all the money
the store spends on utilities.

18:20.660 --> 18:23.446
Amy, that is a big slice of pie.

18:23.447 --> 18:24.944
A very big slice, Jonah.

18:24.946 --> 18:26.612
I mean, I couldn't finish that.

18:26.614 --> 18:30.416
But when the store shifts over
to LED and motion sensors,

18:30.418 --> 18:33.118
then something happens
to that slice of pie.

18:33.120 --> 18:34.320
- Next slide.
- Mm.

18:34.322 --> 18:37.423
That slice gets a lot smaller.

18:37.425 --> 18:40.793
Yeah, you know, if someone
offered me a slice that size

18:40.795 --> 18:42.928
- at a birthday party...
- Okay, I have to leave

18:42.930 --> 18:44.463
in two minutes, so if we could just

18:44.465 --> 18:45.364
hurry this up, please?

18:45.366 --> 18:46.699
- Oh.
- Yeah, of course.

18:46.701 --> 18:48.600
- Go to the end.
- Okay.

18:48.602 --> 18:51.003
- Keep going.
- Let's see, uh... da-da-da.

18:51.005 --> 18:52.862
I'm sorry, was that
the donkey from "Shrek"?

18:52.863 --> 18:54.039
Yeah, that was for a budget pun,

18:54.041 --> 18:55.470
but it doesn't matter anymore.

18:55.471 --> 18:56.423
Oh, okay, here we go.

18:56.424 --> 18:59.178
Uh, once you've added up
all the cost-saving provisions,

18:59.180 --> 19:05.484
- the total savings comes to...
- $18,326.

19:05.486 --> 19:08.554
- Now, that's so many savings.
- Now, that is a lot of savings.

19:08.556 --> 19:09.238
Wow.

19:10.124 --> 19:12.992
That, I have to admit,
is very impressive.

19:12.994 --> 19:14.994
- Thank you.
- That's nice of you to say.

19:16.925 --> 19:19.631
Great, so, um... so Myrtle gets to keep

19:19.633 --> 19:20.923
- her job, then?
- Yay!

19:20.924 --> 19:25.371
Oh, I just... I'm sorry.
I can't justify keeping her.

19:25.373 --> 19:28.040
- Wait.
- Um, but you said that if we

19:28.042 --> 19:29.675
found the savings,
you wouldn't fire her.

19:29.677 --> 19:32.077
I know that I said that,
but, yeah, I just...

19:32.079 --> 19:35.014
honestly, I didn't think
that you'd be able to do it.

19:35.016 --> 19:35.787
All right.

19:36.209 --> 19:38.717
Very impressive, though,
and very good work.

19:39.854 --> 19:41.220
I got my eye on you guys.

19:41.222 --> 19:43.081
You have a very bright future.

19:43.891 --> 19:44.721
Oh.

19:45.526 --> 19:47.259
What's the joke about the donkey?

19:47.261 --> 19:51.063
Oh, uh, "Only an ass would
keep writing blank Shreks"

19:51.065 --> 19:52.712
for doughnut Thursdays."

19:53.369 --> 19:54.125
Funny.

19:55.936 --> 19:57.636
Told you it wasn't funny.

20:06.113 --> 20:08.580
So you've never even been to Denver?

20:08.582 --> 20:11.388
No, why do people keep asking me that?

20:11.389 --> 20:12.407
Laurie.

20:12.953 --> 20:14.477
Ah, quitting time, huh?

20:14.664 --> 20:16.862
- Oh, yeah.
- Man, I cannot wait to get home.

20:16.863 --> 20:18.624
I am gonna get drunk.

20:18.626 --> 20:21.026
Smoke some cigarettes,
jump on my trampoline.

20:21.028 --> 20:22.895
- Whoo!
- Okay, it's a big night.

20:22.897 --> 20:24.428
I'm sorry, you just...

20:24.429 --> 20:25.469
you look different.

20:26.332 --> 20:27.266
Whoa.

20:27.582 --> 20:30.566
You know, in the future, I'd appreciate
if you didn't comment on my body.

20:30.567 --> 20:31.559
You're a woman.

20:31.872 --> 20:33.187
You should know better.

20:37.378 --> 20:39.144
So what do you think of Laurie now?

20:39.146 --> 20:40.029
B-word?

20:40.123 --> 20:40.871
C-word?

20:41.316 --> 20:42.163
A-word?

20:42.164 --> 20:45.717
I think she's a [bleep].

20:45.719 --> 20:46.979
Okay, so same as Jeff.

20:47.514 --> 20:48.780
Yeah, gender neutral.

20:48.923 --> 20:51.557
- We've come a long way.
- Yay!

20:51.559 --> 20:53.725
- What is happening?
- Whoo!

20:53.727 --> 20:57.229
That was the best day ever!

20:57.231 --> 20:59.131
Oh, I'm so glad!

20:59.133 --> 21:02.175
Myrtle, you're fired. I feel terrible.

21:03.404 --> 21:06.905
Whoo, best day ever! Come on!

21:07.186 --> 21:08.188
Best day!

21:09.281 --> 21:10.189
Best day.
