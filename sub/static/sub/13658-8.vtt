IN A BIT OF A HOLE FINANCIALLY,

18:19.532 --> 18:21.699
BUT WE HAD IT ASSESSED,

18:21.701 --> 18:23.401

MORE THAN ZELDA PAID FOR IT.

REPORTING YOUR WIFE MISSING.

THAT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR ZELDA.

ONCE, WHEN JONNY'S SITCOM
WAS CANCELED,

SHE FELT
THAT HE NEEDED HER.

FOR NEARLY A WEEK.

YOUR WIFE'S COLLECTION?

WHO STARTED FOLLOWING JONNY.

IN HER LATE 20s.

INTO JON. [ CHUCKLES ]

ANYTHING LIKE IT.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.530

AGAINST YOUR WIFE.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.998
THAT WAS JUST SO
SHE COULD STAND

OF HER CAREER.

A 72-HOUR PSYCHIATRIC HOLD.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.073

19:41.080 --> 19:42.780
AND THE POLICE --
NO OFFENSE --

19:42.782 --> 19:44.882

KIND OF ASSHOLES ABOUT IT.

WAS IN HIS DRIVEWAY.

WAS INVITE HER INSIDE.
