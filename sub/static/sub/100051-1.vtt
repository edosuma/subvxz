to thank the NYPD

39:20.096 --> 39:22.708
for helping our office
send a message

39:22.751 --> 39:25.275
that it doesn't matter
how rich or powerful you are,

39:25.319 --> 39:27.103
sexual assault will not
be tolerated in New York City.

- Joe, please.
Can you turn this down?

39:29.889 --> 39:31.412
- She can turn on a dime.
Give her that.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.806
- Well, she's back
on our side for now,

39:33.849 --> 39:36.635
and at least Carisi's safe.

39:36.678 --> 39:38.593
It's all good.

39:42.771 --> 39:44.338
You okay?

39:44.382 --> 39:47.254
- The powers that be have
decided that I can't be trusted

39:47.297 --> 39:49.561
to work with the DA's
office going forward.

39:49.604 --> 39:51.650
- What does that mean?

39:51.693 --> 39:54.087
- I'm being send to Coventry.

Safety Task Force...

on Staten Island.

40:01.224 --> 40:03.139
- No, no, no,
they can't do that.

40:03.183 --> 40:05.272
- Feathers were ruffled,
so a head has to roll.

40:05.315 --> 40:06.447
- I will call the press.

40:06.491 --> 40:08.710
I will call 1PP.

40:08.754 --> 40:10.103
I will call whoever I have to.

40:10.146 --> 40:11.147
This is ridiculous.

40:11.191 --> 40:13.236
- Liv, let it go.

40:13.280 --> 40:15.108
I've had a good run.

40:15.151 --> 40:16.544
And it's not time
for you to stick your neck out.

40:16.588 --> 40:19.199
- I'll be the judge of that.
- No.

40:19.242 --> 40:22.855
You've still got work to do,
and gas in the tank.

40:22.898 --> 40:26.336
It'd be a wasted sacrifice...

40:26.380 --> 40:28.643
Captain.

40:31.298 --> 40:34.562
I made it a condition
of my exile.

Don't worry about me.
