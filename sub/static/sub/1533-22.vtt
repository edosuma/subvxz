- Sympathy.

-No, Joe. They wouldn't.

14:27.560 --> 14:31.201
What you're doing, it's called unlawful
imprisonment and human smuggling.

14:31.360 --> 14:33.203
Joe, those are very bad things.

14:33.360 --> 14:37.081
These are some bad people, Cecile.

14:37.240 --> 14:39.129
But their lives are in danger.

14:39.800 --> 14:42.770
I can't. I can't get involved in this, Joe.
I can't.

14:45.880 --> 14:50.044
And as your friend, and possibly the attorney
who will one day be prosecuting you...

14:50.520 --> 14:53.763
...I am telling you,
get as far away from this as possible.

15:03.280 --> 15:08.286
Okay, so A.R.G.U.S. has a transport plane
that can take the metahumans to Lian Yu.

15:08.440 --> 15:11.683
- We need to get them to Ferris Airfield.
-Oliver Queen came through.

15:12.040 --> 15:14.964
No, actually. It was not him.
Apparently he's in Nanda Parbat.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.402
- What?
-Wherever that is. I don't know.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.409
I called Lyla, Diggle's wife.

15:19.600 --> 15:21.807
She's gonna hook us up.

15:21.960 --> 15:24.201
So, what about C.C.P.D. giving us an escort?

15:24.640 --> 15:27.450
Man, it ain't happening.
You saw me talking to the DA.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.090
She was very clear.

15:29.280 --> 15:32.443
I could lose my badge. I could go to jail.
We could go to jail.

We are protecting people.

15:34.960 --> 15:39.761
We are, Barry, but I'm a cop.
There's a certain set of rules I need to follow.

And this year, I broke all of them.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.881
- I know.
-...ignoring the law.

At what point do we become no different
than the people we're fighting?

15:48.520 --> 15:50.045
- We are way different.
-How?

15:50.240 --> 15:52.811

asking for my assistance, but I'll bite.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.889
Five.

...who have powers.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.170

16:56.320 --> 16:58.766

freeze the problem?

16:58.920 --> 17:01.605

They're yours too.

17:16.920 --> 17:19.366

Well, guess what.

These people get loose,
there won't be a city to love anymore.

You won't be able to rob anyone

He didn't do anything to me, Iris.
It's what he showed me.

19:27.400 --> 19:28.526
I asked him for help.

19:28.680 --> 19:30.569
Why would you do something so stupid?

Because, Joe,
we have already tried everyone else.
