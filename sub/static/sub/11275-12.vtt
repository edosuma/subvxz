Christmas from Frasier and me.

  Oh, hey, wow, that's great.

Of course, whenever             
you'd like, Sam.                

16:28.397 --> 16:31.099

             a chance to buy it.

     a bug up his chimney.

                got us presents?

            so many choices,

Oh, and know that I don't       
expect anything in return.

    Oh, you shouldn't           
have gone to the trouble.       

17:19.898 --> 17:21.900
     Oh, just a little something
     to keep your ears warm.

    My God.

Diamond earrings.

I don't believe this!

17:37.666 --> 17:40.135
         but Sammy wins         
         the pucker sweepstakes.

Hey, if he got her diamonds,    
I wonder what he got us.

    a wallet.

                  Thanks for    
                  the soap, Sam.

                 Ooh, and       
                 it's pink, too.

17:54.083 --> 17:56.151
          Uh, listen, I'm sorry 
          about the mix up here,

17:56.185 --> 17:58.486
     but my boss seems to really
     love the diamond earrings. 

17:58.521 --> 18:00.088
                 Can I buy them 
                 from you maybe?

18:00.123 --> 18:03.225
 Well, they were for my mother. 
        They cost $500.         

18:03.259 --> 18:04.293
                $500?

          by your generous gift,

18:11.667 --> 18:14.502
                but I think it's
                inappropriate.  

18:14.536 --> 18:16.638
You mean... you're...           
you're giving it back?

You don't... you don't          
want to keep it?

            I think I should.

    you feel, but I...

      that I wouldn't have

            Thank you.

Is that "thank you" you're      
    giving them back to me,     

18:42.498 --> 18:45.000
         or "thank you"         
you're going to keep them?

very inviting.

                And I'll wear

        make me work tonight.

    the earrings, too.          

19:13.830 --> 19:15.030
    I just can't believe it.    

19:15.064 --> 19:16.615
     Oh, I guess that means     

19:16.649 --> 19:18.667
      there's no lingerie       
      fashion show, then?       

19:18.701 --> 19:21.369
Well, maybe we could do it      
        some other time.

    such a Christmasy thing

21:09.729 --> 21:11.095
            No, I could swear   
            that he came with...

21:11.130 --> 21:12.597
        Okay, wait, now wait.   
        Wait a second now.      

21:12.632 --> 21:15.300
            You don't suppose...

21:15.335 --> 21:17.101
     ( <i>patrons chattering</i> )     

21:17.136 --> 21:19.120
Did you                         
hear that?                      

21:19.155 --> 21:20.622
Nah...                          
                Suppose it could
                be the wind,    

21:20.656 --> 21:22.390
              but it sounded    
              like sleigh bells.

21:22.425 --> 21:25.177
              Oh, come on, guys.
              I mean, seriously,

21:25.211 --> 21:27.145
        there must              
      be some explanation.      

21:27.180 --> 21:28.830
                    Well...     

21:28.864 --> 21:31.633
        Geez, do you...         

21:31.667 --> 21:33.468
          do you think          
  there actually could be a...  

21:36.872 --> 21:38.573
Oh, my wife's                   
gonna kill me.                  

21:38.608 --> 21:40.942
I left the lights on in         
the station wagon again.        

21:40.977 --> 21:42.677
Can one of you guys             
give me a jump?                 

21:42.712 --> 21:45.246
            Eh...!              

21:49.018 --> 21:50.485
  Lilith, that was a miracle.   

21:50.520 --> 21:53.288
            Snowball, you've had
            too much schnapps.  

21:53.322 --> 21:56.191
No, no, I'm stone sober. It's...

21:56.225 --> 21:58.843
I mean, I know that's           
just some fat old guy           
with car trouble, but...        

21:58.877 --> 22:01.879
for half a second there, I      
actually believed in Christmas. 

22:01.914 --> 22:05.016
And th-that hasn't happened     
to me since I was...            

22:05.051 --> 22:06.784
    born.                       

22:08.354 --> 22:10.255
Come on, let's, uh,             

22:10.290 --> 22:11.856
        let's sing some         
        Christmas carols        

22:11.891 --> 22:16.161
    and roast some chestnuts    
    and all that treacle...

        You know, Sammy,        

22:29.291 --> 22:31.042
         I don't want to be     
         ungrateful or anything,

22:31.077 --> 22:33.011
                but this soap   
                sucks wind.

          You bought Miss Humbug
          diamond earrings.     

22:37.282 --> 22:39.684
Oh, come on now.                
There was a reason              
for that, though.               

22:39.719 --> 22:43.254
She has invited me over for     
an intimate late-night supper.  

22:43.288 --> 22:44.555

                Yeah, you, me   

22:44.590 --> 22:46.524
             and half the people

22:49.762 --> 22:52.497
I'm in far too fragile          
a condition.                    

22:52.531 --> 22:54.999

22:57.803 --> 22:59.788
        You know, I wasn't too  
        thrilled about the soap,

22:59.822 --> 23:01.790
    but this makes up for it.

23:20.392 --> 23:22.027
             without having     
             my head bitten off.

    Merry Christmas, Frasier.

    Boston Airport has been     
    temporarily closed          

23:36.292 --> 23:39.528
      due to the presence       
 of a berserk man on Runway Six 

23:39.562 --> 23:41.763
 chasing an Orlando-bound plane 

23:41.798 --> 23:46.935
and throwing what appears       
  to be cans of Chinese food.
