WEBVTT

00:18.875 --> 00:21.500
I have the Power!

01:08.458 --> 01:10.291
We managed to retrieve this footage

01:10.333 --> 01:12.500
from the memory bank of a damaged bot.

01:12.541 --> 01:14.625
The brute's identity remains a mystery,

01:14.666 --> 01:17.333
but we've confirmed him as the thief's accomplice.

01:17.375 --> 01:21.333
She's been identified as a Hand Witch from the lower wards named Teela.

01:21.375 --> 01:25.708
We may need to consider soliciting the aid of our neighbors in the sea and sky.

01:25.750 --> 01:30.250
We don't need the Merfolk or the Avion to help us with anything!

01:31.541 --> 01:33.500
Widen your search, General.

01:33.541 --> 01:36.875
Repurpose every RK drone in the kingdom to help you.

01:36.916 --> 01:40.541
We must find these... enemies of the republic.

01:40.583 --> 01:44.625
Search parameters for persons of interest expanded.

01:45.583 --> 01:48.083
Encoded information included.

01:48.125 --> 01:50.416
Jungle confirms receipt.

01:50.458 --> 01:53.333
Hey, do you know where the...

01:53.375 --> 01:56.083
-Oh! Sorry. -Badlands in motion...

01:56.125 --> 01:57.333
Whatcha listening to?

01:57.375 --> 01:58.875
Security chatter.

01:58.916 --> 02:03.041
It helps me focus when I'm doing something important.

02:03.083 --> 02:06.583
How is fixing a statue of ghost lady important?

02:06.625 --> 02:09.291
My hope is that if we clean up the mess Keldor made,

02:09.333 --> 02:12.333
she might come back out of hiding and give us some answers.

02:12.375 --> 02:13.791
Makes sense.

02:13.833 --> 02:15.916
She dropped being Master of the Universe on us,

02:15.958 --> 02:19.416
then vanished without telling us what that actually means.

02:19.458 --> 02:21.500
And there's no such thing as a free lunch.

02:21.541 --> 02:23.291
-Yes, there is. -No, there isn't.

02:23.333 --> 02:25.500
We had free lunch back in the village every day.

02:25.541 --> 02:27.083
That isn't what I meant.

02:27.875 --> 02:29.500
Okay, what is your deal?

02:29.541 --> 02:31.250
Uh, quick question.

02:31.291 --> 02:33.916
How much of the castle have you explored?

02:35.708 --> 02:37.458
Why?

02:49.666 --> 02:51.666
Oh, hey, Krass.

02:51.708 --> 02:55.000
You weren't about to do your business in my dad's helmet, were you, Adam?

02:55.041 --> 02:57.625
Not like you haven't done it plenty of times on hunts.

02:57.666 --> 03:00.875
It's my helmet to do whatever I want to do in it.

03:00.916 --> 03:03.416
I'll just... use the moat?

03:05.250 --> 03:06.708
What are we still doing here?

03:06.750 --> 03:09.166
Figuring out where the bathroom is in this place?

03:09.208 --> 03:10.791
Adam, I'm serious!

03:10.833 --> 03:13.166
We're learning to become Masters of the Universe, right?

03:13.208 --> 03:15.916
-Protecting the Power of Grayskull? -From who?

03:15.958 --> 03:19.000
The only people that even knew about this spooky pile of rocks

03:19.041 --> 03:21.333
were your uncle and his Word Witch.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.000
And they're gone now.

03:23.041 --> 03:25.125
So what reason do we have to stay?

03:28.750 --> 03:31.000
That's what I thought.

03:31.041 --> 03:32.958
No, Krass, wait!

03:33.000 --> 03:36.291
Oh, that's a long way down.

03:53.458 --> 03:57.333
Must you do that here?

03:59.833 --> 04:02.291
It's not like we can go see a medic anywhere.

04:02.333 --> 04:04.791
Besides, this looks worse than it really is.

04:08.458 --> 04:11.583
Attend me, my minions!

04:14.833 --> 04:19.250
So in the eyes of the skeletal despot with delusions of grandeur,

04:19.291 --> 04:23.083
we've gone from coconspirators to minions.

04:23.125 --> 04:24.666
Lovely.

04:24.708 --> 04:26.916
How much longer we have to put up with this?

04:26.958 --> 04:29.916
Long enough to seize the Havoc Staff for ourselves.

04:31.416 --> 04:34.375
What are you two conspiring about?

04:36.791 --> 04:39.500
We were off discussin' our, uh,

04:39.541 --> 04:42.583
concern for you, mighty Skeletor.

04:42.625 --> 04:45.583
After all, you spoke so eloquently

04:45.625 --> 04:48.333
of ushering in a new era for Eternia

04:48.375 --> 04:52.291
but have been pouting in the bath ever since.

04:57.750 --> 05:01.416
Don't confuse pouting with plotting.

05:01.458 --> 05:05.291
We were routed by children, after all.

05:05.333 --> 05:08.875
The only reason they gained the advantage was your nephew's decision

05:08.916 --> 05:12.916
to share the Power of Grayskull with them.

05:12.958 --> 05:17.041
An unexpected application of an inferior product.

05:17.083 --> 05:20.375
Havoc... is where it's at.

05:22.833 --> 05:26.750
Then perhaps you should do the same for us with Havoc--

05:26.791 --> 05:30.791
using your staff to share in place of his sword.

05:31.458 --> 05:33.250
A fine idea.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.791
Yet the Sword of Power was crafted

05:35.833 --> 05:39.958
from the rarest metal on Eternia, Kirbinite,

05:40.000 --> 05:43.958
the only known metal capable of transferring cosmic power.

05:44.000 --> 05:50.583
Unfortunately for you, my Havoc Staff is hewn from more common metals.

05:51.958 --> 05:54.500
I, uh, might know where you could find some

05:54.541 --> 05:56.875
if you were interested in a Kirbinite upgrade.

05:56.916 --> 06:00.250
--What? I made things.

06:00.291 --> 06:02.875
I know where Randor has some Kirbinite stashed away.

06:02.916 --> 06:05.958
But he's beefed up security since the sword got snatched.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.708
And we're short our usual thief.

06:11.375 --> 06:15.541
What if we just find a new thief,

06:15.583 --> 06:18.416
one that's guaranteed to get under Randor's skin

06:18.458 --> 06:22.333
before I claim his throne for myself?

06:32.083 --> 06:36.250
I have a bone to pick with him anyway.

06:40.375 --> 06:42.041
Yeah.

06:59.541 --> 07:02.125
Are we certain they went this way?

07:02.166 --> 07:04.541
Jungle Unit RK's uploaded vectors

07:04.583 --> 07:08.500
from some of those bots that encountered the thief and her warrior.

07:08.541 --> 07:12.166
Apparently, a bunch of them flew this way in pursuit of their vehicle.

07:20.333 --> 07:22.125
Multiple inbound contacts

07:22.166 --> 07:25.541
in violation of airspace and speed restrictions.

07:25.583 --> 07:27.416
Multiple citations pending.

07:27.458 --> 07:28.708
The poacher's robots?

07:28.750 --> 07:30.791
--I think not, General.

07:47.125 --> 07:49.041
All right, ghost lady.

07:49.083 --> 07:52.916
I finish this, you tell me that I'm still in control of my own fate.

07:52.958 --> 07:57.000
Because powers or not, I'm nobody's puppet.

08:04.208 --> 08:05.708
Ouch!

08:06.375 --> 08:07.666
What now?

08:10.125 --> 08:11.833
Mayday, mayday!

08:11.875 --> 08:14.041
This is General Dolos calling for an emergency evac!

08:14.083 --> 08:16.125
We have crashed and are under attack!

08:16.166 --> 08:18.375
Fall back! Fall back!

08:19.791 --> 08:21.416
And that's it?

08:21.458 --> 08:23.708
-I was able to turn-- -Incoming!

08:25.250 --> 08:27.041
This place is unpredictable.

08:27.083 --> 08:29.291
This place is amazing.

08:29.333 --> 08:31.500
You were able to what?

08:31.541 --> 08:33.250
Sorry.

08:33.291 --> 08:35.750
I was able to track the signal all the way out to the Badlands.

08:35.791 --> 08:38.875
It'll be a while before anyone from Eternos can get to them.

08:38.916 --> 08:41.125
Randor's thugs can take care of themselves.

08:41.166 --> 08:43.250
-Yeah.

08:45.583 --> 08:47.500
Not our problemo.

08:48.583 --> 08:50.375
What if it was?

08:50.416 --> 08:52.333
We have the Power of Grayskull.

08:52.375 --> 08:53.625
Let's use it.

08:53.666 --> 08:56.708
Like we owe it to destiny or something?

09:02.916 --> 09:06.458
I don't like owing anyone anything.

09:14.375 --> 09:15.916
Fine.

09:15.958 --> 09:18.708
He-Man will just save these soldiers all by himself.

09:24.416 --> 09:27.708
He doesn't know how to fly the ship, does he?

09:27.750 --> 09:29.125
No, he does not!

09:29.166 --> 09:33.666
And I'll bet there'll be plenty of things to ram.

09:35.458 --> 09:38.750
I hate it when he uses my own words against me.

09:58.125 --> 10:01.916
Nothing like coming back to the place we were buried alive, huh?

10:03.666 --> 10:06.000
Hope these guys are worth it.

10:13.250 --> 10:15.208
Let's just get this over with.

10:17.333 --> 10:19.875
Sister, you are speaking my language.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.791
Why does them teaming up make me feel sick in my tummy?

10:45.291 --> 10:49.833
We need to talk. I'm sorry this is all so... weird.

10:49.875 --> 10:51.083
All what,

10:51.125 --> 10:53.333
you racing off to rescue your dad's guards

10:53.375 --> 10:56.291
so he'll be impressed and ask you to move in?

10:56.333 --> 10:59.250
Not without the rest of you.

10:59.291 --> 11:02.458
Do you really think the King wants a thief, a jungle girl,

11:02.500 --> 11:06.375
a criminals' assistant, and a tiger living in the Royal Palace?

11:06.416 --> 11:07.750
We're in this together.

11:09.166 --> 11:12.666
What if we don't choose to do this together?

11:12.708 --> 11:16.416
Um, I didn't say you... couldn't.

11:21.583 --> 11:22.916
Quiet down. We're here.

11:22.958 --> 11:24.916
Then let's master up.

11:24.958 --> 11:27.125
Power up. Upgrade.

11:27.166 --> 11:28.750
Whatever. I'm working it out.

11:28.791 --> 11:29.875
Shh!

11:32.000 --> 11:34.708
By the Power of Grayskull...

12:02.250 --> 12:04.666
...We Have the Power!

12:09.833 --> 12:12.250
Teela, what gives?

12:12.291 --> 12:15.916
I'm good with my own magic, thanks.

12:41.291 --> 12:42.916
Where are the soldiers?

12:51.125 --> 12:53.375
There are the soldiers.

12:53.416 --> 12:54.833
Identify yourselves.

12:55.750 --> 12:58.625
We're... here to save you.

13:00.333 --> 13:02.333
Persons of interest located.

13:02.375 --> 13:04.208
Initiate arrest protocols.

13:04.250 --> 13:07.041
Unidentified warrior and Hand Witch Teela,

13:07.083 --> 13:10.750
lower your weapons and stand down for arrest.

13:10.791 --> 13:15.291
Oh, we're the persons of interest from the encrypted message.

13:15.333 --> 13:18.833
Yeah, you stole the sword and I'm clearly holding it,

13:18.875 --> 13:20.791
so that tracks.

13:20.833 --> 13:24.625
Guards, lock them inside the ship until we can locate General Dolos.

13:24.666 --> 13:28.166
Exactly what happened to General Dolos?

13:30.833 --> 13:33.333
One assumes... that.

13:36.583 --> 13:40.083
These beasts have not walked this planet for many millennia.

13:40.125 --> 13:41.958
How are they even... alive?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.125
I don't think they are.

13:44.166 --> 13:46.875
-I'll keep the guards out of the way. -

13:53.208 --> 13:56.041
The rest of you, break some bones.

13:58.500 --> 13:59.625
Come and get it!

14:31.041 --> 14:33.625
This green stuff looks real familiar.

14:33.666 --> 14:37.125
It's Havoc, your uncle's favorite kind of magic.

14:37.166 --> 14:40.166
I guess he might not be that vaporized after all.

14:40.208 --> 14:42.083
Then why attack these soldiers?

14:45.291 --> 14:47.000
Does it really matter right now?

15:01.541 --> 15:05.250
It is illegal to prevent the apprehension of a subject of ro--

15:05.291 --> 15:07.458
Ugh. Sorry, little guy.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.125
But thanks.

15:12.125 --> 15:13.958
These things won't stay down.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.708
Maybe we just aren't hitting them hard enough.

15:15.750 --> 15:17.166
Hold on!

15:18.250 --> 15:20.000
Lightning strike!

15:35.541 --> 15:37.541
I don't see how that's possible.

15:42.958 --> 15:45.041
These things are magic, Teela.

15:45.083 --> 15:46.416
Any suggestions?

15:46.458 --> 15:49.291
Try separating the Havoc from the bones entirely.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.291
Easier said than done.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.708
Ain't that something--I don't know--

15:57.750 --> 15:59.166
Sorceress might be good at?

16:01.333 --> 16:03.375
If I drop my tut, my spell breaks

16:03.416 --> 16:06.750
and these soldiers come out to arrest us and then get eaten.

16:08.166 --> 16:10.791
And I don't want to use magic that isn't mine.

16:10.833 --> 16:12.583
Just an observation,

16:12.625 --> 16:15.375
but that didn't seem to bother you when Adam gave it to you.

16:15.416 --> 16:18.333
The first rule of life in the wards is survival.

16:18.375 --> 16:21.125
We were getting our butts handed to us when Adam gave it to me.

16:21.166 --> 16:23.458
We won't have any butts left to be handed

16:23.500 --> 16:26.000
if you don't power up and help.

16:26.041 --> 16:27.458
Teela, please.

16:33.458 --> 16:35.125
Say the words, Adam.

16:35.166 --> 16:36.291
All right!

16:36.333 --> 16:39.208
By the Power of Grayskull...

16:55.458 --> 16:58.625
...I have the Power!

18:09.083 --> 18:11.083
That falcon...

18:11.125 --> 18:12.916
was that you?

18:12.958 --> 18:16.083
The castle's powers and yours are one and the same.

18:16.125 --> 18:20.166
You are the Sorceress of Grayskull,

18:20.208 --> 18:22.125
just as I once was.

18:22.166 --> 18:25.666
Does that mean... I'm gonna end up like you,

18:25.708 --> 18:27.375
a ghost?

18:27.416 --> 18:30.875
Is that what your hesitation is about?

18:30.916 --> 18:34.708
You fear having your future decided for you.

18:34.750 --> 18:38.333
You only need fear winding up a ghost lady like me

18:38.375 --> 18:41.416
if you make the same choices...

18:41.458 --> 18:43.625
and mistakes...

18:43.666 --> 18:45.250
I have.

18:45.291 --> 18:48.250
Your future is your own.

18:48.291 --> 18:50.625
Whether you use it or not,

18:50.666 --> 18:55.375
the Power gifted to you by Adam belongs with you.

18:56.583 --> 18:59.375
What if I do mess up?

18:59.416 --> 19:01.875
We are all here to help you, Teela.

19:03.125 --> 19:05.708
You are no longer alone.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.291
Who are you?

19:11.333 --> 19:14.750
You may call me Eldress.

19:23.666 --> 19:25.458
That was odd.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.458
Teela? Are you all right?

19:32.500 --> 19:36.083
Sorry it took so long for me to make a decision to transform.

19:36.125 --> 19:39.541
I'm... just not used to looking out for anyone else.

19:39.583 --> 19:45.416
Hey, this whole friends-as-family thing is... new for all of us.

19:47.625 --> 19:52.041
That is what's happening here, right? Did I just put myself out there too much?

19:54.000 --> 19:57.416
Does this for sure mean Adam's uncle and his cronies are still alive?

20:00.375 --> 20:02.500
Kronis is a crony. Ah!

20:02.541 --> 20:04.583
Am I the only one just getting that?

20:04.625 --> 20:07.083
They can't get away with what they did to our village.

20:07.125 --> 20:08.333
I know.

20:08.375 --> 20:10.291
And we won't let them.

20:10.333 --> 20:11.833
Right?

20:11.875 --> 20:14.041
We're in this together.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.250
-Yes! -Yeah!

20:20.166 --> 20:22.500
Merriment aside, one does, however,

20:22.541 --> 20:25.375
have to wonder what Keldor wanted with those soldiers.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.458
We'll see the criminals again.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.833
Let's get back to searching for the General.

21:08.166 --> 21:13.000
General, I have to say...

21:13.041 --> 21:14.500
you've looked better.

21:16.166 --> 21:19.291
Despite the interference of your nephew and his friends,

21:19.333 --> 21:22.500
part one of your plan was a success.

21:22.541 --> 21:26.541
Kronis, it's time for part two.

21:26.583 --> 21:30.958
Why steal the Kirbinite when we can just take it?

21:40.166 --> 21:41.958
How do I look?
