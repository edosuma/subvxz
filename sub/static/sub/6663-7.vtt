ADULT ADAM:  <i>Back in the '80s,</i>

00:01.068 --> 00:03.235
<i>you had cars that could</i>

00:03.237 --> 00:04.036
<i>cars that caught ghosts,</i>

00:04.038 --> 00:07.239
<i>and cars that could talk</i>
<i>to David Hasselhoff.</i>

00:07.241 --> 00:11.110
<i>So when my brother Barry</i>
<i>got his license...</i>

00:11.211 --> 00:14.580
<i>He was finally free!</i>

<i>you're never free.</i>

00:41.876 --> 00:44.209
Tush inside. Now.

00:44.211 --> 00:44.777
What the hell?

00:44.779 --> 00:48.714
Are you just sitting back
there waiting for me?
Yes.

00:48.716 --> 00:49.815
Tush!

00:49.817 --> 00:50.816
Rule number seven...

00:50.818 --> 00:52.584
Total focus on the road.

00:52.586 --> 00:55.287
No eating, no passengers,
no music.

00:55.289 --> 00:56.789
What?
No music.

00:56.791 --> 00:57.456
Rule number eight...

00:57.458 --> 01:00.893
Doors must be locked
and windows
rolled up at all times.

01:00.895 --> 01:03.529
All times.
That's insane!

01:03.531 --> 01:04.863
Which brings us
to number nine...

01:04.865 --> 01:08.000
You only drive in safe areas.

01:08.002 --> 01:09.635
That means...

01:09.637 --> 01:12.104
Stay within the green zone.

01:12.106 --> 01:14.239
You got a map
with plastic overlays?

01:14.241 --> 01:15.607
Who does that?

01:15.609 --> 01:16.041
I do.

01:16.043 --> 01:19.778
And rule number ten,
and this is
the most important rule...

01:19.780 --> 01:21.313
Call me when you get there.

01:21.315 --> 01:25.050
Always call me
when you get there.

01:25.052 --> 01:27.519
Why do I have to
call you when I get there?

01:27.521 --> 01:30.389
I'm there.
I know I'm there.

01:30.391 --> 01:32.024
But I don't know.
For all I know,

01:32.026 --> 01:34.326
you could be stranded
in the middle of nowhere,

01:34.328 --> 01:35.861
lying facedown in a ditch.

01:35.863 --> 01:37.663
Do the dishes, damn it!

01:37.665 --> 01:38.597
Ditches, okay?

01:38.599 --> 01:39.631
You're just blindly
agreeing with her

01:39.633 --> 01:42.000
and have no idea what
she's even talking about.

01:42.002 --> 01:44.603
Oh, oh, I know
what she's talking about.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.005
Right there.
Learn your state capitals.

01:47.007 --> 01:50.109
But you're too much
of a big shot to study.

01:50.111 --> 01:51.610
Let me tell you
somethin', mister.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.312
College is right
around the corner,

01:53.314 --> 01:57.616
and you need to shape up
or ship out.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.252
We're talking about her
stupid driving rules, dad.

02:00.254 --> 02:03.622

For once? Please?

02:22.743 --> 02:24.209
<i>Barry did not call</i>
<i>when he got there</i>

02:36.189 --> 02:36.788

02:36.790 --> 02:40.125
You didn't call your

she tightens the clamps

Last week, I went
to study at Lainey's house
two blocks away,

05:09.877 --> 05:12.577
and as always,
I called when I got there.

05:12.579 --> 05:13.445
I said, "I'm here, mom.

"We're playing
Def Leppard records

05:14.581 --> 05:17.582
