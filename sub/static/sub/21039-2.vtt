plungers and the mystery Mouseketool.

13:54.317 --> 13:57.442
[Goofy] Hmm, which Mouseketool can help us

13:57.525 --> 13:59.692
get the gooey fish out of the way?

14:00.775 --> 14:05.150
[Donald]
I know! The two-handed handy crane!

14:05.400 --> 14:10.358
[Mickey] Yeah! Its two big hands
can pick up the gooey fish and move it.

14:11.608 --> 14:15.233
We got ears. Say, "Cheers."

14:27.983 --> 14:30.233
[Donald] Oh, boy! What a catch!

14:30.567 --> 14:32.483
You hooked a big one, Donald.

14:46.150 --> 14:47.608
Now, let's see.

14:47.692 --> 14:51.025
We've been to the Sandy Desert
and the Rushing River.

14:51.733 --> 14:54.025
Now we have to go to the Hidden Jungle.

14:54.442 --> 14:56.275
Where's the Hidden Jungle?

14:58.692 --> 15:01.567
Right! That's where
we'll find Plunderin' Pete's

15:01.650 --> 15:05.442

Come on, let's go!

15:06.400 --> 15:09.358

15:17.567 --> 15:19.900
I just know you're gonna be happy here.

15:19.983 --> 15:22.150
And if those clubhousers follow us,

15:22.233 --> 15:24.942

Another tricky trap.

16:56.067 --> 16:58.942
Hmm, I don't see any other way in.

16:59.067 --> 17:01.733
We're gonna have to find a way
to get up the slide.

17:01.817 --> 17:04.317
What we need is a Mouseketool.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.733

17:05.817 --> 17:07.900
[sing-song] "Oh, Toodles!"

17:20.858 --> 17:25.858
[Mickey] Let's see, we have the plungers
and the mystery Mouseketool.

17:26.067 --> 17:28.400
Can the plungers help us get up the slide?

17:29.692 --> 17:32.817
[Minnie] Well, the plungers have big
suction cups on their ends,

17:32.900 --> 17:36.525
just like Toodles' arrow,
and it stuck to the slide.

17:36.650 --> 17:40.025
[Mickey] So maybe we could hang
onto the plungers as we climb.

17:40.233 --> 17:43.358
-Let's try it!
-[Goofy] Oh, boy! Plungers!

17:44.067 --> 17:47.692

Come on, everybody.
Let's grab onto the handles and climb up.

18:12.233 --> 18:13.692

It's just that I like to be surrounded

20:02.400 --> 20:05.233
To make the doors and windows
open up again,

20:05.317 --> 20:07.692

Okay, everyone,
