01:34.173 --> 01:36.164
This is a true story.

01:37.413 --> 01:41.201
How often have you seen that statement
at the beginning of a picture?

01:41.293 --> 01:44.729
It sometimes means
that there was a man named Napoleon,

01:44.813 --> 01:50.046
but that any similarity between what he did
in life and what he's going to do in this movie

01:50.133 --> 01:52.203
is strictly miraculous.

01:53.333 --> 01:55.767
<i>Well, this is a true story,</i>

01:55.853 --> 01:59.687
about a sweet,
rather baffled young housewife,

01:59.773 --> 02:03.561
who, in 1951, in her hometown in Georgia,

02:03.653 --> 02:08.568
suddenly frightened her husband
by behaving very unlike herself.

02:08.652 --> 02:12.282
There's nothing unique in that.
We all have moods.

02:12.373 --> 02:18.323
We all have a secret yen to behave
like somebody we particularly admire.

02:18.413 --> 02:25.967
A modern writer has said that inside every
fat man, a thin man is struggling to get out.

02:26.733 --> 02:30.169
Well, in a literal and terrifying sense,

02:30.253 --> 02:33.051
inside this demure young woman

02:33.133 --> 02:39.971
two very vivid and different personalities
were battling for the mastery of her character.

02:40.053 --> 02:44.365
She was, in fact, a case of what is called
"multiple personality",

02:44.453 --> 02:50.164
something that all psychiatrists have
read about and very few have ever seen.

02:50.253 --> 02:56.169
Certainly not Dr Thigpen and Dr Cleckley,
of the Medical College of Georgia,

02:56.253 --> 03:02.726
who one day were confronted with a woman
who had one personality more than Dr Jekyll.

03:02.813 --> 03:08.171
Their account of the case was delivered to
the American Psychiatric Association in 1953,

03:08.253 --> 03:12.929
and it's already a classic
of psychiatric literature.

03:13.013 --> 03:18.292
So this movie needed no help
from the imagination of a fiction writer.

03:18.373 --> 03:21.683
The truth itself was fabulous enough.

03:21.773 --> 03:28.849
And all the episodes you're going to see
happened to this girl they call Eve White,

03:28.933 --> 03:35.486
and much of the dialogue is taken from the
clinical record of the doctor we call Dr Luther.

03:41.293 --> 03:44.410
<i>The date is August 20th, 1951.</i>

04:14.453 --> 04:16.250
<i>(woman) Come in.</i>

04:20.053 --> 04:22.442
- Mrs White?
- Yes, ma'am.

04:22.533 --> 04:24.489
<i>- Dr Luther.
- Yes?</i>

04:24.573 --> 04:28.088
Mrs White is here. The lady
Dr Watkins wrote to you about.

04:28.173 --> 04:30.971
<i>- Ask her to come in, will you?
- Yes, Doctor.</i>

04:31.053 --> 04:33.123
Will you come in, please?

04:38.773 --> 04:41.333
- How do you do, Mrs White?
- How do you do?

04:41.413 --> 04:44.405
- Come in. Sit here, will you?
- Thank you.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.484
Mr White.

04:46.573 --> 04:48.564
Let's see.

04:50.093 --> 04:52.084
Thank you.

04:54.013 --> 04:58.564
<i>Dr Watkins is a very old friend of mine.
How long have you known him?</i>

04:58.653 --> 05:01.292
He's the doctor we go to.

05:01.373 --> 05:04.445
He's a very able man. Very able.

05:05.973 --> 05:09.807
Let's see. He says you've been troubled
with very bad headaches.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.453
Yes, sir, terrible ones.

05:12.533 --> 05:15.411
- And some sort of spells?
- Yes, sir.

05:16.253 --> 05:18.813
What kind of spell?

05:18.893 --> 05:21.930
I don't know. l'm not exactly sure.

05:23.013 --> 05:25.607
What happens when you have one?

05:25.693 --> 05:29.527
Is it, uh, what they say, uh... amnesia?

05:29.613 --> 05:33.970
Well, amnesia means loss of memory.
Is that what happens to you?

05:34.053 --> 05:36.044
Yes, I guess that's it.

05:37.213 --> 05:41.172
- How often does this happen?
- Sometimes twice a week now.

05:42.093 --> 05:44.971
- And the headaches, what about them?
- Same thing.

05:45.053 --> 05:48.648
- They happen at the same time?
- Yes, sir.

05:48.733 --> 05:53.204
First I get this terrible headache
and then I get this spell.

05:53.293 --> 05:57.252
Now, when you say "spell",
do you mean you faint or anything like that?

05:57.333 --> 06:02.771
No, sir, it's not like faintin'. It's more like...

06:02.853 --> 06:08.610
Well, it's like the other day I was playing
out in the back yard with Bonnie

06:08.693 --> 06:13.813
and all of a sudden I got this splitting
headache and then the next thing I knew,

06:13.893 --> 06:17.806
I mean, the next thing I was conscious of,
it was the next morning.

06:17.893 --> 06:21.442
- Who's Bonnie?
- Oh, that's my little girl.

06:21.533 --> 06:23.649
- How old is she?
- She's four and a half.

06:23.733 --> 06:26.372
- Your only child?
- Yes, sir.

06:26.453 --> 06:30.969
- I lost another baby about four months ago.
- I see.

06:32.613 --> 06:36.731
And you have no recollection
at all of what happened?

06:36.813 --> 06:40.692
Where you were or what you did between
the time you were playing in the back yard

06:40.773 --> 06:42.923
and the next morning?

06:44.173 --> 06:46.164
No, sir, I don't.

06:48.573 --> 06:50.564
Were you at home at the time?

06:50.653 --> 06:52.848
I was there as soon as
I come home from work.

06:52.933 --> 06:54.924
Yes?

06:56.013 --> 06:59.642
I didn't see much different in her.

07:00.533 --> 07:03.331
<i>Well, did you see any difference?</i>

07:05.053 --> 07:09.729
I guess not. Nothing you could say
was really different.

07:13.053 --> 07:17.251
<i>For several weeks Mrs White was
greatly helped by the psychiatric treatment.</i>

07:17.333 --> 07:20.131
<i>She had fewer headaches
and they were less severe.</i>

07:20.213 --> 07:24.286
<i>She had no more blackout spells -
at least, none that she was aware of.</i>

07:24.373 --> 07:26.284
<i>But not quite a year later,</i>

07:26.453 --> 07:30.731
<i>several things happened that showed her
to be in urgent need of help.</i>

07:30.813 --> 07:36.410
<i>The first alarm was sounded
around noontime of a spring day in 1952.</i>

07:40.373 --> 07:42.648
Anybody home?

07:42.733 --> 07:46.612
Oh, hey. Just a minute
while I hang out the wash.

07:55.613 --> 07:57.729
- Where's Bonnie?
- Here I am.

07:58.053 --> 08:01.807
- Hi, sugar.
- l'm wearing Mom's shoes.

08:01.893 --> 08:04.248
Mommy will tan your britches
if she finds you.

08:04.333 --> 08:06.324
This one hurts.

08:09.653 --> 08:13.328
- Where'd you get these?
- They're Mommy's.

08:14.293 --> 08:17.012
- Where'd she get'em?
- The postman brought them today

08:17.093 --> 08:18.765
- with the dresses.
- What dresses?

08:19.813 --> 08:22.008
On the bed.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.608
Evie?

08:25.693 --> 08:29.732
- Let me have them.
- No! I wanna wear 'em. Mommy said I could!

08:29.813 --> 08:32.850
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

08:58.493 --> 09:01.291
What's the idea of all this?

09:01.373 --> 09:03.364
Didn't you buy'em?

09:04.093 --> 09:07.722
What do you mean, didn't I buy'em?
Didn't you?

09:07.813 --> 09:12.204
No, I thought you did.
I thought it was sweet, but I...

09:13.933 --> 09:15.924
It's got your name on it.

09:16.013 --> 09:18.573
You know I wouldn't buy
anything like that, Ralph.

09:18.653 --> 09:22.612
- $218.
- That's what I mean, they cost that much.

09:22.693 --> 09:26.003
- Where'd they get your name?
- I don't know. I thought you did it.

09:26.093 --> 09:28.607
I mean, I thought you bought 'em for me.

09:28.693 --> 09:33.721
But I was gonna make you take 'em back
because I knew it was too much.

09:33.813 --> 09:38.523
l'll say it's too much.
You had me scared there for a minute.

09:38.613 --> 09:42.970
I guess they just must have made
some kind of mistake, that's all.

09:43.053 --> 09:45.044
Well, l'll call'em.

09:59.413 --> 10:03.292
<i>- Is this the Beehive Store?
- Yes, sir. Is there anrthing I can do for you?</i>

10:03.373 --> 10:05.728
<i>- Is this Miss Effie?
- Who is this?</i>

10:05.813 --> 10:07.212
It's Ralph White.

10:07.293 --> 10:11.923
For goodness sakes, I thought you and Evie
would be on your way to Hollywood by now.

10:12.013 --> 10:14.811
<i>- Hollywood?
- With all those pretty things Evie bought.</i>

10:14.893 --> 10:17.646
You ought to be proud of
how she looks in those dresses.

10:17.733 --> 10:20.452
Especially that lilac one.

10:20.533 --> 10:24.492
l'm bringing'em all back this afternoon.

10:30.453 --> 10:32.091
<i>(Eve) Bonnie?</i>

10:33.653 --> 10:38.329
- Come on in, honey, and wash your hands.
- Tell her not to come in yet.

10:38.413 --> 10:42.088
- What's the matter?
- Tell her l'll call her.

10:43.573 --> 10:46.565
Never mind, honey.
l'll call you when we're ready.

10:46.653 --> 10:48.644
Shut that door.

10:50.653 --> 10:52.644
Hurry up.

10:57.093 --> 10:59.402
Come here.

10:59.613 --> 11:01.604
Will you come here?

11:08.493 --> 11:11.644
I got a good mind to slap your face.

11:11.733 --> 11:15.043
- What'd they say?
- What kind of dope do you think I am?

11:15.133 --> 11:17.124
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

11:17.213 --> 11:21.525
What did you think I was gonna do? Nothing?
Let you get away with it? 218 bucks!

11:21.613 --> 11:26.733
- I didn't buy'em.
- You mean Miss Effie Blandford's a liar?

11:26.813 --> 11:29.373
- She said I bought 'em?
- She didn't say nothin' else.

11:29.453 --> 11:31.171
I don't see how she could.

11:31.253 --> 11:34.006
You mean to tell me
you didn't try on those dresses?

11:34.093 --> 11:38.052
I haven't been in the Beehive in months.

11:38.133 --> 11:41.330
Sometimes I don't know whether
you're crazy or you think I am.

11:41.413 --> 11:44.291
Are they gonna take 'em back?
l'll pack'em up for you.

11:44.373 --> 11:45.772
- l'll do it.
- Let me.

11:45.853 --> 11:48.492
You heard me. I said l'd do it.

12:14.733 --> 12:17.122
<i>(Bonnie) l'm hungry, Mommy.</i>

12:18.333 --> 12:21.325
<i>(screams)</i>

12:21.413 --> 12:23.404
Evie!

12:24.653 --> 12:26.644
<i>(shrieks)</i>

12:28.293 --> 12:30.284
It's all right, honey.

12:30.373 --> 12:33.251
<i>(wails)</i>

12:33.333 --> 12:36.166
It's OK. You'll be all right.

12:39.893 --> 12:41.929
It's all right, honey.

12:44.893 --> 12:46.963
Don't get up.

12:49.733 --> 12:51.803
l'll kill you if you get up.

13:05.853 --> 13:09.129
- I didn't do it.
- But I saw her.

13:09.213 --> 13:10.487
I didn't do it.

13:10.573 --> 13:14.771
How can she say a thing like that
when I saw her with my own eyes?

13:14.853 --> 13:18.084
- You mean you don't remember doing it.
- I didn't do it.

13:18.173 --> 13:21.768
- I suppose you didn't buy those clothes?
- l'd die before l'd hurt Bonnie.

13:21.853 --> 13:25.163
Why do you suppose Ralph says
things like that if they're not true?

13:25.253 --> 13:29.883
- I love her too much.
- You wouldn't come home last month.

13:29.973 --> 13:35.331
She went to Atlanta and then wouldn't come
home cos she was havin' too big a time.

13:35.413 --> 13:38.962
When I went up to get her, she cussed
me and said she never would come home.

13:39.053 --> 13:43.126
- How about how much you loved her then?
- Will you let me talk to her alone?

13:43.213 --> 13:45.727
She wouldn't come home to me or to Bonnie.

13:45.813 --> 13:48.805
We'll just be a few minutes.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.887
You didn't answer my question, Mrs White.

13:57.973 --> 14:00.362
That's not true, what he said.

14:00.453 --> 14:02.603
What's not true?

14:02.693 --> 14:07.528
- I haven't been to Atlanta in nearly a year.
- That's what I mean.

14:07.613 --> 14:11.242
Why do you think he says
things like that if they're not true?

14:11.333 --> 14:15.406
- I don't know.
- But he'd have to have some reason to do it.

14:15.493 --> 14:20.123
- Yes, sir, I suppose so.
- Have you thought what that might be?

14:20.213 --> 14:23.125
- I thought of one.
- What was that?

14:24.053 --> 14:27.409
Maybe he wants to get Bonnie
away from me.

14:27.493 --> 14:31.805
- Do you mean by divorce?
- No, sir, maybe not that.

14:31.893 --> 14:36.091
But maybe he can make me believe
l'm losing my mind.

14:37.173 --> 14:42.406
- Is that what you think he's trying to do?
- I don't know what else it could be.

14:42.493 --> 14:45.565
- Am I?
- I find no evidence of it.

14:46.253 --> 14:50.769
- But you're not positive.
- I couldn't be positive of anything so quickly.

14:50.853 --> 14:53.492
But the fact you may be having
spells of amnesia

14:53.573 --> 14:58.772
doesn't mean that you're what you call
losing your mind. Doesn't mean that at all.

14:58.853 --> 15:00.889
It's no use.

15:00.973 --> 15:06.206
Cos I am. You don't want to tell me,
but I know it now.

15:06.293 --> 15:10.081
How do you know it, Mrs White?

15:10.173 --> 15:13.722
Because now l'm hearin' voices too.

15:21.493 --> 15:23.688
What kind of voices?

15:23.773 --> 15:27.607
Just one voice.
But that's what that means, doesn't it?

15:27.693 --> 15:30.526
- How long has this been going on?
- For months.

15:30.613 --> 15:33.411
Why didn't you tell me this before?

15:33.493 --> 15:36.053
What does this voice say to you?

15:36.133 --> 15:38.203
She tells me to do things.

15:38.293 --> 15:41.683
A woman's voice?
Can you recognise it in any way?

15:41.773 --> 15:43.650
No, sir.

15:43.733 --> 15:48.853
It sounds familiar sometimes,
but I don't really recognise it.

15:48.933 --> 15:51.811
What does this voice tell you to do?

15:53.053 --> 15:59.811
To do things like... leave Ralph,
take Bonnie and run away.

15:59.893 --> 16:03.681
All kind of terrible things like that.

16:03.773 --> 16:06.367
That is what it means, isn't it?

16:07.253 --> 16:09.608
No, not in your case.

16:09.693 --> 16:13.242
- But that's what everybody says.
- And in most cases they'd be right.

16:13.333 --> 16:16.769
It's a serious manifestation,
the hearing of voices.

16:16.853 --> 16:21.688
But the difference in your case is this:
you've been frightened by this voice

16:21.773 --> 16:24.651
because you recognise it
as a symptom of illness.

16:24.733 --> 16:27.531
People who are actually losing their minds

16:27.613 --> 16:30.411
rarely find anything extraordinary
about hearing voices.

16:30.493 --> 16:35.487
They almost invariably assume it's
some sort of extra privilege that they enjoy,

16:35.573 --> 16:40.488
like personal radio reception
or a built-in radar.

16:40.573 --> 16:46.045
Yeah, but what if sometimes it...
it sounds like my own voice?

16:47.173 --> 16:49.892
Your own voice?

16:49.973 --> 16:52.965
- Doesn't make any difference.
- Yes, it does.

16:53.053 --> 16:56.841
You just don't wanna tell me, but it does, I...

17:12.772 --> 17:14.763
Mrs White?

17:22.213 --> 17:24.089
Hi.

17:26.133 --> 17:28.521
Feeling better now?

17:28.613 --> 17:30.604
I feel fine.

17:35.533 --> 17:40.607
- What was it? A headache?
- No, I didn't have no headache.

17:40.693 --> 17:43.332
She had one, but I didn't.

17:43.413 --> 17:46.689
- "She"?
- You got a nice place around here.

17:48.453 --> 17:51.604
Oh, she always gets those headaches
when I wanna come out.

17:51.693 --> 17:54.969
I think she's a real dope, don't you?

17:55.053 --> 17:58.329
- Who are you talking about?
- Eve White.

17:59.293 --> 18:03.605
It's these hose.
They're nylon and l'm allergic to nylon.

18:03.693 --> 18:07.732
I think l'll take'em off.
You don't mind, do you?

18:07.813 --> 18:09.804
If you like.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.209
I think you'd better turn around, though.

18:13.293 --> 18:16.922
You're kinda cute,
but I don't think I know you that well.

18:23.573 --> 18:25.928
Maybe sometime, though, huh?

18:26.253 --> 18:30.246
- Hey, you like to go dancin'?
- Sometimes.

18:30.333 --> 18:35.532
Would you like to go dancin' with me?
OK, you can turn around now.

18:37.773 --> 18:40.890
- So you're not Eve White?
- I certainly am not.

18:40.973 --> 18:44.568
Maybe one night this week.
You can tell your wife you gotta see a patient.

18:44.653 --> 18:47.565
- And do what?
- And go dancin'.

18:47.653 --> 18:51.123
I bet you're a real cute dancer.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.204
I doubt if my wife would agree,

18:53.293 --> 18:56.330
but back to the point -
if you're not Eve White, who are you?

18:56.413 --> 18:59.962
Now what are you trying to do, kid me?

19:00.053 --> 19:03.682
Seems more likely you're trying to kid me.

19:03.773 --> 19:06.571
l'm Eve Black. You know that.

19:06.653 --> 19:10.612
- You mean that was your maiden name?
- That's still my name.

19:10.693 --> 19:14.049
l've never been married.
That's for laughs, gettin' married.

19:14.133 --> 19:19.332
- What about Ralph?
- You don't think l'd marry ajerk like that?

19:19.413 --> 19:21.768
And Bonnie isn't your child?

19:21.853 --> 19:26.210
Not while l'm in my right mind she isn't.

19:27.213 --> 19:29.408
Boy, what fat books.

19:34.013 --> 19:36.368
Hey, is this radio working?

19:44.733 --> 19:48.408
You got a back door to your office.
We could get out without him seeing.

19:48.493 --> 19:51.485
<i>- Will you excuse me?
- You're not gonna tell him, are you?</i>

19:51.573 --> 19:54.167
l'll be right back. You wait here.

19:54.253 --> 19:56.244
It's up too high.

20:09.573 --> 20:11.484
Excuse me. l'll be right back.

20:14.053 --> 20:16.044
Is that her?

20:21.013 --> 20:24.323
- Ever had a case of multiple personality?
- No.

20:24.413 --> 20:26.973
Do you think you'd recognise one
if you saw one?

20:27.053 --> 20:29.408
I don't know. l'm not so sure.

20:29.493 --> 20:33.645
But I can tell you this, l'll bet ya
I can spot a fake as far as I can see one.

20:33.733 --> 20:37.043
- Whom do you suspect?
- Mrs White. Mrs Eve White.

20:37.133 --> 20:40.330
- That dreary little woman?
- That's the one.

20:40.413 --> 20:42.404
<i>(music louder)</i>

20:50.693 --> 20:52.684
Everything all right?

20:55.053 --> 20:58.807
Oh, hi. Got your buddy with you, huh?

20:58.893 --> 21:03.808
- May I turn this off?
- Oh, sure. What did I do, scare you?

21:03.893 --> 21:06.771
- You remember Dr Day?
- Sure. Hi.

21:06.853 --> 21:10.129
- How are you, Mrs White?
- That's what you think.

21:10.213 --> 21:14.604
- This is Miss Eve Black, Doctor.
- How do you do, Miss Black?

21:14.693 --> 21:17.082
<i>How do you do?</i>

21:17.173 --> 21:21.689
- You don't mind talking to both of us?
- The more there are, the better I like 'em.

21:21.773 --> 21:24.765
And you say you are not Mrs White now?

21:24.853 --> 21:29.051
OK, you wanna hear it again?
I am not Mrs White. My name is Eve Black.

21:29.133 --> 21:32.045
Then how does it happen
that you remember meeting me?

21:32.133 --> 21:34.203
Cos I know everything that happens to her.

21:34.293 --> 21:37.569
She don't know anything about me,
but I know everything about her.

21:37.653 --> 21:39.291
Everything I want to, anyway.

21:39.373 --> 21:43.412
There's some things about her l'm not
interested in, like thatjughead out there.

21:43.493 --> 21:45.290
Mr White, she means.

21:45.373 --> 21:48.410
And the thing is, she don't really
even care anything about him.

21:48.493 --> 21:51.053
She tells herself she does
cos she thinks she ought to.

21:51.133 --> 21:53.203
Don't think I never told her so, too.

21:53.293 --> 21:56.091
- What did you tell her?
- Leave the so-and-so.

21:56.173 --> 21:58.926
Take the kid and beat it.
What can he do about it?

21:59.013 --> 22:01.811
- How did you tell her?
- I yelled at her.

22:01.893 --> 22:05.852
I don't know whether she heard me or not,
but I really hollered at her.

22:05.933 --> 22:08.572
Boy, I can tell you, though,
l'm gonna fix his wagon.

22:08.653 --> 22:11.725
I ain't gonna go through
the rest of my life with that creep.

22:11.813 --> 22:14.008
And you say that Bonnie is not your child?

22:14.093 --> 22:18.291
Oh, now, Doctor. How could I have a child
if l'm not even married?

22:18.373 --> 22:21.365
You tryin'to insinuate somethin'?

22:22.293 --> 22:27.811
- You mean Ralph never made love to you?
- Boy, l'd like to see him try.

22:27.893 --> 22:30.487
Where were you, then,
when Bonnie was born?

22:30.573 --> 22:34.361
It looks like to me that's your problem,
Doctor, not mine.

22:34.453 --> 22:37.092
Don't you have any fans in this office?
It's hot in here.

22:37.173 --> 22:39.243
How are you gonna fix Ralph's wagon?

22:39.333 --> 22:41.403
- You really wanna know?
- I do indeed.

22:41.493 --> 22:44.690
l'm gonna come out and l'm gonna stay out.

22:46.613 --> 22:50.731
- Were you ever on the stage, Miss Black?
- No, not exactly on the stage.

22:50.813 --> 22:53.247
But I sang in nightclubs, a lot of 'em.

22:53.333 --> 22:55.972
- Where?
- Well, across the river's one.

22:56.053 --> 23:00.683
- The Big Apple. You ever been there?
- No, l'm afraid I haven't.

23:00.773 --> 23:03.003
They're crazy about me at the Big Apple.

23:03.093 --> 23:06.972
Every time I go in there,
they ask me to stand up and sing.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.567
Of course, I have to be
in the mood to do it, though.

23:09.653 --> 23:14.932
- What kind of mood?
- I have to have a couple of snorts first.

23:15.013 --> 23:18.005
Can you come out,
as you call it, whenever you want to?

23:18.093 --> 23:21.005
No. I wish I could, but I can't.

23:21.093 --> 23:23.129
Sometimes I can, but sometimes I can't.

23:23.213 --> 23:27.764
But it's getting easier. Cos she's gettin'
weaker and l'm gettin' stronger.

23:27.853 --> 23:30.925
And one of these days,
l'm gonna come out and stay out,

23:31.013 --> 23:32.605
just you wait and see.

23:33.133 --> 23:35.408
And can you retire,
go back in when you want to?

23:35.493 --> 23:41.443
Sure. You know what I done one night?
One night Ralph had to go to Savannah,

23:41.533 --> 23:44.570
so I went over to the Big Apple
and I got kinda gassed up.

23:44.653 --> 23:48.532
You know what I done the next morning?
I let her have the hangover.

23:48.613 --> 23:50.968
<i>(giggles)</i>

23:51.053 --> 23:55.092
- She's faking.
- Oh, you should have seen her face.

23:55.173 --> 23:59.769
Listen, Mrs White,
I regret to have to say this, but I...

24:08.973 --> 24:10.486
Hello, Doctor.

24:11.213 --> 24:13.044
Mrs White?

24:21.013 --> 24:23.402
<i>On May 17th, 1952,</i>

24:23.493 --> 24:27.930
<i>Mrs White was admitted to the psychiatric
section of the University Hospital</i>

24:28.013 --> 24:30.208
<i>for observation and treatment.</i>

24:30.293 --> 24:34.969
<i>During the first week, her behaviour was
excellent. There was nothing uneven about it.</i>

24:35.053 --> 24:39.649
<i>But Dr Luther still
could not decide when, or even if,</i>

24:39.733 --> 24:43.885
<i>to confront her with the knowledge of
the personality that she had suppressed.</i>

24:43.973 --> 24:49.809
"Love took up the glass of Time,
and turn'd it in his glowing hands;

24:49.893 --> 24:55.206
Every moment, lightly shaken,
ran itself in golden sands."

24:55.933 --> 25:01.087
"Love took up the harp of Life,
and smote on all the chords with might;

25:01.733 --> 25:08.605
Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling,
pass"d in music out of sight."

25:09.533 --> 25:14.288
That's beautiful. l've never heard it before.

25:14.373 --> 25:18.491
Well, I don't really understand what it means.
I just like to read it anyway.

25:18.573 --> 25:20.803
Doesn't have to mean anything in particular.

25:20.893 --> 25:23.088
Good morning.

25:23.693 --> 25:26.969
Would you like to read this one?

25:28.693 --> 25:31.765
"Dear, beauteous Death..."

25:33.053 --> 25:35.089
- Good morning, Doctor.
- Good morning.

25:35.173 --> 25:38.404
- Good morning, Doctor.
- How's it going?

25:38.493 --> 25:42.281
- Oh, I feel much better, thank you.
- She looks better, too, don't you think?

25:42.373 --> 25:45.490
- Yeah, she really does.
- See you later, Mrs White.

25:45.573 --> 25:50.089
- l'll be in the office, Doctor.
- Thanks, Lenny.

25:50.173 --> 25:55.531
- Heard from Ralph?
- He came by for a few minutes yesterday.

25:55.613 --> 26:00.812
- What about Bonnie?
- She's back with my mother and father now.

26:02.533 --> 26:05.445
Tell me something, Mrs White.

26:05.533 --> 26:09.412
Would you say that your marriage,
speaking of it as a whole,

26:09.493 --> 26:11.768
has been a happy one?

26:14.053 --> 26:16.044
No, sir.

26:17.493 --> 26:20.371
Well, some of it, but not as a whole.

26:21.573 --> 26:23.564
Don't you love Ralph?

26:26.453 --> 26:28.444
Yes, sir.

26:28.533 --> 26:32.845
Then why do you think
it hasn't been a happy marriage?

26:32.933 --> 26:34.924
I don't know.

26:36.173 --> 26:40.928
I guess I just haven't
been able to make him happy.

26:41.013 --> 26:46.804
I don't know what it is I do
that irritates him so much, but I do.

26:46.893 --> 26:50.010
Well, tell me something else.

26:50.093 --> 26:56.487
Have you ever had the feeling that,
somewhere deep down inside you,

26:56.573 --> 27:00.407
there might be somebody
you couldn't quite reach,

27:00.493 --> 27:03.963
but that you nevertheless knew was there?

27:06.813 --> 27:09.043
No, sir.

27:09.133 --> 27:12.409
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

27:22.133 --> 27:25.603
- Good night, Doctor.
- Good night.

27:27.133 --> 27:29.124
Hey.

27:32.293 --> 27:34.966
Come here a minute.

27:39.613 --> 27:43.083
Come on. I ain't gonna bite ya.

27:49.733 --> 27:52.645
- Got a cigarette?
- Oh, sure.

28:04.933 --> 28:07.401
- Thank you.
- It's all right.

28:09.333 --> 28:13.087
- Why don't you come in for a minute?
- Well, no. No, you know the rules.

28:13.173 --> 28:15.607
Aw, come on.

28:15.693 --> 28:17.649
I got a poem for you.

28:20.573 --> 28:22.564
Come on. Hm?

28:26.813 --> 28:29.407
I... I can't stay long, though.

28:30.293 --> 28:32.284
It's a limerick.

28:39.853 --> 28:41.844
Chicken!

28:53.813 --> 28:55.963
<i>- Dr Luther?
- Yes?</i>

28:56.053 --> 28:58.851
<i>- About Mrs White...
- Yes?</i>

28:58.933 --> 29:03.085
That lady is a whole lot healthier
than you think she is, Doctor.

29:07.893 --> 29:10.566
Can you control your emergence?

29:12.173 --> 29:18.408
- Says which?
- I want you not to come out, even if you can.

29:18.493 --> 29:20.529
l'm tired of this place.

29:22.013 --> 29:24.163
- It's a nuthouse.
- It's a hospital.

29:24.253 --> 29:28.929
You don't see any bars
or anything like that, do you?

29:29.013 --> 29:31.083
Is she crazy?

29:31.173 --> 29:34.609
No, but you can drive her crazy
if you don't behave yourself.

29:34.693 --> 29:38.208
Why? I don't know what I have to do with it.

29:38.293 --> 29:41.365
I haven't got anything to do with her.

29:43.333 --> 29:45.767
You're wasting your time with that.
l'm a doctor.

29:48.813 --> 29:50.804
- You're cute, you know that?
- Listen...

29:50.893 --> 29:54.806
Hey, look, why don't you and I go out and
have some fun? I can slip on somethin'.

29:54.893 --> 29:58.044
Do you wanna be shut up
in one of these places for life?

29:58.133 --> 30:00.522
One with bars?

30:00.613 --> 30:05.528
- What do you mean?
- I mean if you get into any trouble at all,

30:05.613 --> 30:09.652
Mrs White will be adjudged crazy,
but it'll be both of you that'll be locked up.

30:09.733 --> 30:11.485
But why, if l'm all right?

30:11.573 --> 30:15.646
You're not gonna be subdivided
by any court or board l've heard of yet.

30:15.733 --> 30:21.285
Where Mrs White goes, you go. And that
means into an asylum if she's committed.

30:21.373 --> 30:27.403
An asylum with locked doors and bars
and straitjackets. Now, is that clear?

30:27.493 --> 30:29.484
I guess so.

30:29.573 --> 30:34.010
Well, it had better be.
Cos that'd be the end of it for you too.

30:34.093 --> 30:39.247
No more dancing, no more... snorts,
no more anything.

30:39.333 --> 30:41.324
Ever.

30:44.813 --> 30:49.125
Even if I don't come out,
what do you figure to do about it?

30:49.213 --> 30:51.602
I don't know. l'm not sure.

30:53.253 --> 30:58.805
Nobody knows too much about this, because
there haven't been too many such cases.

30:58.893 --> 31:04.206
But for a starter... I think
l'd like to tell Eve White about you.

31:05.333 --> 31:07.801
What do you want to do that for?

31:08.613 --> 31:12.447
- You object?
- Won't that worry her even more?

31:12.533 --> 31:15.127
I thought you didn't care
what happened to her.

31:15.213 --> 31:16.931
I don't really.

31:17.013 --> 31:21.450
But I mean, you know, if she worries any
more, ain't she liable to go crazy anyway?

31:21.533 --> 31:27.085
l'm afraid that is a possibility, but that's
a chance I think we're gonna have to take.

31:27.173 --> 31:31.132
If we're ever gonna reunite these
two personalities, to put it simply,

31:31.213 --> 31:34.171
l'd say the first logical step
to take in that direction

31:34.253 --> 31:36.608
would be to introduce 'em to each other.

31:36.693 --> 31:39.332
Introduce 'em? Ha!

31:39.413 --> 31:42.291
Doc, you flip me, you really do.

31:43.293 --> 31:46.763
Look. I don't have to put on much.
Let's go on out and have a little fun.

31:46.853 --> 31:49.731
Mrs White.

31:54.133 --> 31:55.725
I don't underst...

32:01.773 --> 32:04.890
I had another one, hadn't I?

32:04.973 --> 32:06.964
A little one.

32:10.893 --> 32:12.884
I was hopin'...

32:18.853 --> 32:24.689
I think l'd better tell you as well as I can
just what the situation is.

32:24.773 --> 32:28.402
Have you ever heard of multiple personality?

32:34.733 --> 32:38.521
<i>Now all Dr Luther had to do
was to explain this situation to Ralph.</i>

32:38.613 --> 32:41.207
- How are you, Ralph?
- Good morning, sir.

32:41.293 --> 32:44.683
- How's Evie?
- Much better now.

32:44.773 --> 32:50.769
- Have you found out what's wrong with her?
- That's what I wanted to talk to you about.

32:58.733 --> 33:01.406
It's a very unusual case.

33:01.493 --> 33:04.371
One of the rarest, in fact,
in the history of psychiatry.

33:04.453 --> 33:05.966
You don't say.

33:06.053 --> 33:11.650
Mrs White's problem is
what is called multiple personality.

33:12.613 --> 33:16.128
- Yes, sir.
- Have you ever heard of that?

33:16.213 --> 33:21.367
- No, sir, I can't say as I ever have.
- What actually happens is this:

33:21.453 --> 33:26.811
At some point in the past,
apparently when she was a little girl,

33:26.893 --> 33:30.806
her personality became divided

33:30.893 --> 33:33.885
into two different personalities.

33:33.973 --> 33:37.443
In effect, she's now two different women,

33:37.533 --> 33:40.684
entirely different in character.

33:42.693 --> 33:45.810
To be more specific about it -

33:45.893 --> 33:50.887
the girl you married, Bonnie's mother,
the sweet, quiet girl you fell in love with,

33:50.973 --> 33:53.362
that's one of the women.

33:53.453 --> 33:56.092
The other is the one that scared Bonnie,

33:56.173 --> 33:59.688
the one who bought all those clothes
and had that row with you in Atlanta.

33:59.773 --> 34:02.890
You know those headaches
and blackout spells?

34:02.973 --> 34:09.764
Well, that was when this other woman,
the one who calls herself Eve Black,

34:09.853 --> 34:12.208
was trying to get out.

34:12.293 --> 34:14.487
Out of where?

34:15.612 --> 34:18.491
Out of the body. Your wife's body.

34:18.572 --> 34:21.690
Well, how do you like that?

34:22.733 --> 34:30.003
But what I want you to understand
is that this is an actual mental condition.

34:30.092 --> 34:32.447
It isn't pretending or faking.

34:32.533 --> 34:34.967
She can't help it.

34:35.053 --> 34:37.965
But that doesn't mean she's psychotic.

34:38.053 --> 34:40.043
Crazy.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.404
Do you understand?

34:44.413 --> 34:45.732
No, sir.

34:49.973 --> 34:54.170
Well, let's see if I can put it
to you in another way.

34:56.213 --> 35:03.324
In the first place, no one has ever defined
the personality as a psychopathological...

35:07.213 --> 35:11.001
- I think you'd better come with me.
- Yes, sir.

35:15.613 --> 35:17.604
<i>(knock on door)</i>

35:21.973 --> 35:24.851
Come in.

35:24.933 --> 35:29.484
- You've got company this morning.
- Hello, honey.

35:29.573 --> 35:31.768
Hi.

35:31.853 --> 35:35.129
- How's Bonnie?
- She's all right.

35:35.213 --> 35:38.808
I asked Ralph to come in so that
I could explain the situation to him.

35:38.893 --> 35:42.727
So he'll understand when you leave here.

35:42.813 --> 35:45.327
You know who he is, don't you?

35:45.413 --> 35:49.452
- You mean Ralph?
- Who is he?

35:49.533 --> 35:51.763
Well, he's my husband, of course.

35:51.853 --> 35:54.287
And you're the mother of his child,
aren't you?

35:54.373 --> 35:56.728
Of course.

35:56.813 --> 36:01.011
- You're Mrs White? That's your name?
- Yes, sir.

36:01.093 --> 36:05.484
All right, now, may I speak with Eve Black?

36:05.573 --> 36:07.291
Of course.

36:08.293 --> 36:10.284
Eve Black?

36:19.373 --> 36:21.807
- Oh, spit!
- You know who this is?

36:21.893 --> 36:24.168
- I sure do.
- Now, just a minute there.

36:24.253 --> 36:25.447
Your husband?

36:25.533 --> 36:30.448
<i>If I have told you once I have told you
ten thousand times, I ain't got no husband.</i>

36:30.533 --> 36:33.923
If I was gonna have one, it wouldn't be
no lead-bottom like Ralph White.

36:34.013 --> 36:37.130
- What'd you have to tell him for?
- Bonnie isn't your child?

36:37.213 --> 36:40.762
- She's her child and you know it.
- I got a good mind to slap your face.

36:40.853 --> 36:43.128
- l'd like to see you try.
- You ain't foolin' me.

36:43.213 --> 36:45.647
Don't get angry.
Just talk to her and watch her.

36:45.733 --> 36:48.645
And don't use your temper,
use your sense about it.

36:48.733 --> 36:51.088
May I speak to Mrs White?

36:51.173 --> 36:54.643
You sure can. And don't ever bring me back
while that pea-picker's here.

36:54.733 --> 36:56.724
Mrs White?

37:08.413 --> 37:11.485
- Did I go out again?
- Just for a few minutes.

37:11.573 --> 37:13.609
- Evie?
- Eve Black?

37:20.213 --> 37:24.809
- I told you I wasn't gonna talk to him again.
- Mrs White?

37:34.613 --> 37:39.892
<i>After she'd been in the hospital for two
weeks, Dr Luther and Dr Day were satisfied</i>

37:39.973 --> 37:43.761
<i>that whether she behaved
as Eve White or Eve Black,</i>

37:43.853 --> 37:46.925
<i>she would do no harm to herself or to others.</i>

37:47.013 --> 37:51.325
<i>So, on 30th May, 1952,
they discharged her.</i>

37:52.733 --> 37:56.521
<i>During those two weeks, Ralph
had left Bonnie with the grandparents</i>

37:56.613 --> 38:00.288
<i>and found for himself a better job
in Jacksonville, Florida.</i>

38:00.373 --> 38:03.092
<i>But Mrs White was not to go with him.</i>

38:03.173 --> 38:08.042
<i>For, on the advice of Dr Luther, she decided
to stay in town, in a furnished room,</i>

38:08.133 --> 38:10.693
<i>for further and more regular treatment.</i>

38:10.773 --> 38:15.972
<i>This decision caused a separation
that was to have unexpected consequences.</i>

38:16.693 --> 38:18.843
Might as well get started, I guess.

38:18.933 --> 38:23.404
<i>- Ralph, l'm awful sorry.
- That's all right. You couldn't help it.</i>

38:23.493 --> 38:25.768
Breakin' up everything like this.

38:25.853 --> 38:29.129
Well, he can get you well, can't he?

38:29.213 --> 38:31.852
- I hope so.
- Didn't he say?

38:31.933 --> 38:35.608
- No.
- Didn't he say anything?

38:35.693 --> 38:40.608
He said he'd do the best he could.
That's about the only thing he could do.

38:40.693 --> 38:45.209
- Maybe.
- Well, I think he will, honey.

38:46.933 --> 38:49.686
They don't like to promise too much,
you know.

38:49.773 --> 38:52.526
- You really think so?
- You know how some of 'em are.

38:52.613 --> 38:58.165
They like to make a big thing out of it so
as they look better when they knock it off.

38:58.253 --> 39:01.882
The only trouble, though,
I sure am gonna miss Bonnie.

39:01.973 --> 39:04.931
She's OK. Your folks
will take care of her all right.

39:05.013 --> 39:07.163
You don't have to worry about her.

39:07.253 --> 39:10.404
Yeah, but if I don't get well,
I might never see her again.

39:10.493 --> 39:14.930
Stop that, will you? Of course you'll
see her again, cos you are gonna get well.

39:15.013 --> 39:19.086
I mean, you ain't really crazy, you know.
He told me that hisself.

39:19.173 --> 39:22.085
I mean, I asked him confidentially
and he said no.

39:22.173 --> 39:26.246
He said there were nothing the matter
with you except this multiplied personality.

39:26.333 --> 39:30.121
And that ain't anywhere near crazy.
Now, he told me that hisself.

39:30.813 --> 39:33.122
You gonna stop worrying now?

39:33.213 --> 39:37.092
- l'll try.
- You do that and you'll be all right.

39:40.213 --> 39:42.204
Goodbye, honey.

39:43.093 --> 39:45.129
l'll send you some more money on Saturday.

39:45.213 --> 39:48.250
Oh, you don't have to do that.
l'm gonna get ajob.

39:48.333 --> 39:52.326
That'd help,
but l'll still send you some money.

39:55.373 --> 39:58.365
You take care of yourself, you hear?

40:19.293 --> 40:21.284
<i>(hums)</i>

40:34.893 --> 40:37.851
- I feel like singing.
- So what's stopping you?

40:37.933 --> 40:39.651
All right.

40:39.733 --> 40:41.928
Hey. Do you know "Hold Me"?

40:42.013 --> 40:44.288
You got it, pretty woman. OK, fellas...

40:44.373 --> 40:47.445
- Stand back, Big Daddy.
- One, two...

40:50.893 --> 40:52.884
<i>(sings "Hold Me')</i>

41:43.933 --> 41:47.562
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot my shoes.

41:47.653 --> 41:49.723
Thank you.

41:49.813 --> 41:52.486
- Let's get outta here.
- No, l'm thirsty. I want a drink.

41:52.573 --> 41:55.212
- l'll get us a bottle on the way.
- On the way where?

41:55.293 --> 41:59.286
- Hey, how about a snort, tall, dark and ugly?
- Come on. l'll find a place.

41:59.373 --> 42:02.445
What are you talking about?
This place is fine. I like it.

42:02.533 --> 42:05.923
Look, I gotta be back
to the post by one. Let's go.

42:06.013 --> 42:11.485
Are you crazy? l'm not going any place with
you. I don't know what you're talkin' about.

42:11.573 --> 42:14.883
Don't give me that.
I didn't buy you all these drinks for nothing.

42:14.973 --> 42:17.203
All right, l'll go with you some other time.

42:17.293 --> 42:20.171
You're going with me now
if you don't want some of this.

42:20.253 --> 42:23.245
Stop it. That hurts. Let me go.

42:24.173 --> 42:27.927
- See what I mean?
- You hurt me. I don't like to get hurt.

42:28.013 --> 42:31.528
You know how much I shelled out
on you already? Eight bucks' worth.

42:31.613 --> 42:35.572
When I spend eight bucks on a chick,
I don'tjust go home with the morning paper.

42:35.653 --> 42:39.441
So let's not have
any more arguments about it.

42:48.293 --> 42:50.568
What's the matter with you?

43:03.893 --> 43:06.646
What kind of a gag is this?

43:06.733 --> 43:08.724
Maybe she's sick.

43:10.533 --> 43:12.524
Say, look, honey, I...

43:13.173 --> 43:14.652
<i>(sobs)</i>

43:14.733 --> 43:17.088
Ah! For the love of Mike.

43:21.078 --> 43:24.434
We missed you Sunday.
Where were you?

43:24.518 --> 43:29.797
- I went up on the bus to see Bonnie.
- l'll bet she was glad to see you.

43:31.038 --> 43:33.506
- Oh, Ralph.
- Hi, Eve.

43:37.358 --> 43:41.829
- Why didn't you let me know?
- I wanted to surprise you.

43:43.398 --> 43:47.152
- Mr Fox, would you excuse us, please?
- Certainly, ma'am.

43:54.158 --> 43:56.149
Siddown, won't you?

44:02.598 --> 44:06.910
You know why I come up here?
I want you to come back with me.

44:06.998 --> 44:10.274
- I can't do that. l'm not well yet.
- Who says you ain't?

44:10.358 --> 44:13.430
Dr Luther. I know it's true.

44:13.518 --> 44:15.509
I think it's even worse now.

44:15.598 --> 44:19.910
Is he the one who told you
to go out to the Big Apple every night?

44:19.998 --> 44:22.876
That's... that's what I mean.
I didn't know about it.

44:22.958 --> 44:25.392
Thought I wouldn't find out about it, huh?

44:25.478 --> 44:28.470
- I didn't know about it, I tell you.
- You didn't know about it?

44:28.558 --> 44:32.028
You knew enough about it to get ginned up.
You was well enough for that.

44:32.118 --> 44:34.109
Fella I know saw you out there, twice.

44:34.198 --> 44:36.917
Tight as a tick and dancin'
and throwing your dress up.

44:36.998 --> 44:39.387
Ralph, now,
Dr Luther explained all that to you.

44:39.478 --> 44:41.514
He even showed you. You told me so.

44:41.598 --> 44:45.671
Now, look. I don't know which one of you is
foolin', you or him - but somebody is.

44:45.758 --> 44:48.431
Because l've been askin' people about it.

44:48.518 --> 44:50.873
I asked two doctors,
and you know what they said?

44:50.958 --> 44:53.597
They said it looked like
somebody was kiddin' somebody.

44:53.678 --> 44:56.272
But, Ralph, it is somethin'. Believe me, it is.

44:56.358 --> 45:00.795
Then let it be something in Jacksonville.
Where are your bags? Let's get outta here.

45:00.878 --> 45:04.712
If I don't check out of that motel by ten,
they'll charge me for another six hours.

45:04.798 --> 45:08.552
I won't leave here until l'm well again,
not till I have Bonnie back with me.

45:08.638 --> 45:10.754
OK, we'll get Bonnie
and take her with us.

45:10.838 --> 45:13.955
l'm not gonna be alone with her,
not till l'm well.

45:14.038 --> 45:16.029
You're not gonna be alone with her?

45:16.118 --> 45:18.791
She tried to hurt Bonnie once before.
She scared her.

45:18.878 --> 45:21.836
Will you cut that out?
I don't wanna hear any more about it.

45:21.918 --> 45:24.876
Why don't you just talk to Dr Luther
just for a few minutes?

45:24.958 --> 45:29.634
- No, I already talked to two regular doctors.
- Then l'm not going!

45:29.718 --> 45:33.347
You know what you need?
You need a darned good whippin'.

45:33.438 --> 45:37.875
- Knock some of that nuttiness out of you.
- l'm not goin' and that's all there is to it.

45:37.958 --> 45:40.870
I suppose you'd rather stay here
and go to that Big Apple.

45:40.958 --> 45:44.234
Not until Dr Luther tells me I can leave.

45:44.318 --> 45:47.913
And what if I don't want you by then?

45:47.998 --> 45:53.356
Well, I can't help it.
l'm not gonna leave here, not until l'm well.

45:53.438 --> 45:59.388
- You don't want to see Bonnie again?
- Not until l'm well, no.

45:59.478 --> 46:02.072
I wouldn't count on it then either,
if I were you.

46:02.158 --> 46:05.673
If you think l'll have people laughing at me,
you got another think comin'.

46:05.758 --> 46:09.353
If you were really crazy, it'd be different.
But not this multiplied thing.

46:09.438 --> 46:14.751
So you don't come with me now,
that's all there is to it, you understand?

46:14.838 --> 46:17.591
I can't help it, Ralph.

46:17.678 --> 46:20.146
OK, if that's the way you want it.

47:01.518 --> 47:03.713
<i>- (knock on door)
- Come in.</i>

47:18.518 --> 47:20.873
Hi.

47:20.958 --> 47:23.836
Where'd you get that dress?

47:23.918 --> 47:25.909
You like it?

47:28.758 --> 47:33.036
- Did you buy that yourself?
- Got a lot of skirt, see?

47:36.278 --> 47:40.635
- I never saw that dress before.
- That's because you've been away.

47:41.118 --> 47:44.872
- Why don't you fix me one of them drinks?
- You kiddin'?

47:45.558 --> 47:48.550
Well, don't you wanna give me one?

47:48.638 --> 47:51.357
Well, I never seen you take a drink before.

47:51.438 --> 47:56.512
There are a lotta things you never seen me
do before. That's no sign I don't do 'em.

47:56.598 --> 47:59.066
Are you gonna fix me one or not?

48:03.278 --> 48:05.746
<i>Don't look like to me
you're awful glad to see me.</i>

48:05.838 --> 48:08.830
After comin' up all of this way, too.

48:11.518 --> 48:13.509
Straight.

48:23.158 --> 48:26.355
- You ain't foolin' me.
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.

48:26.438 --> 48:29.714
- I know what you're tryin' to do.
- What?

48:37.798 --> 48:41.108
You're tryin' to make me think
you're that... that other one.

48:41.198 --> 48:44.429
- What other one?
- You know what I mean.

48:44.518 --> 48:48.352
You mean you don't even know
your own wife when you see her?

48:48.438 --> 48:50.394
You ain't Evie.

48:51.678 --> 48:53.794
You think not?

48:53.878 --> 48:57.632
I never seen Evie do a thing like that
in my whole life before.

48:57.718 --> 49:00.676
- You don't like it?
- That ain't the question.

49:06.038 --> 49:08.108
Come here.

49:09.238 --> 49:12.071
Oh, come on. Sit down.

49:12.158 --> 49:14.831
Oh, come on. l'm not gonna bite ya.

49:24.038 --> 49:26.108
You know, you're real cute.

49:26.198 --> 49:30.237
- What are you up to?
- Well, l'm not up to a thing.

49:30.318 --> 49:33.833
I just said you were cute.
Something wrong with that?

49:33.918 --> 49:38.230
- No, but I...
- You know, I didn't used to go for you.

49:38.318 --> 49:44.314
But you must be gettin' cuter these days,
cos you sure look cute to me now.

49:46.558 --> 49:48.549
Are you really...?

49:48.638 --> 49:50.151
Really what?

49:54.078 --> 49:58.549
l'll be doggoned if I ever saw anything
like this in my whole life before.

49:58.638 --> 50:00.629
You ain't mad, are you?

50:04.678 --> 50:06.908
No, I guess not.

50:06.998 --> 50:09.910
You know what you ought to do?

50:09.998 --> 50:11.716
What?

50:11.798 --> 50:17.031
<i>I think you ought to ask me
to go to Jacksonville with you.</i>

50:17.118 --> 50:20.827
<i>- I don't think so.
- Well, you asked her.</i>

50:20.918 --> 50:28.108
- I don't know if this is the same thing or not.
- You wanted her to go with you, didn't you?

50:33.238 --> 50:35.468
Aah! Oh, oh, oh!

50:35.558 --> 50:38.516
Oh, boy, you work faster
than I thought you did.

50:38.598 --> 50:40.634
l'm gonna tell your wife on you.

50:40.718 --> 50:42.788
What do you mean, my wife?
You are my wife.

50:42.878 --> 50:46.348
That's not what you said a few minutes ago.

50:49.558 --> 50:51.549
You really want to go away with me?

50:51.638 --> 50:55.313
- Maybe. Only not tonight I can't.
- Why not tonight?

50:55.398 --> 50:59.949
Cos I ain't got anything
to wear to Jacksonville.

51:00.038 --> 51:04.554
- We could pick up some things.
- Them ol' tacky things?

51:04.638 --> 51:07.391
This is the only really nice dress I got.

51:07.478 --> 51:09.992
It's gettin' kinda old.

51:10.078 --> 51:16.916
Besides, can't go to Jacksonville
with just one dress, even if it was new.

51:16.998 --> 51:19.273
If I buy you a dress,
will you go away with me?

51:19.358 --> 51:22.111
Maybe. If you buy me a pretty one.

51:22.198 --> 51:26.191
- Will you go now?
- I can't. Stores ain't open now.

51:26.278 --> 51:31.398
- Don't you trust me?
- Sure. I just want the dress first.

51:31.478 --> 51:34.356
OK. Give us a little kiss.

51:34.438 --> 51:37.908
- Does that mean you'll buy me somethin'?
- I told you I would, didn't I?

51:37.998 --> 51:40.558
OK. Butjust a little one.

51:41.638 --> 51:43.310
<i>(squealing)</i>

51:43.398 --> 51:46.435
- Hey, is that what you call a little one?
- Hey.

51:46.518 --> 51:49.396
- What?
- Come here.

51:50.958 --> 51:54.075
I think we'd better get started, don't you?

51:54.158 --> 51:56.433
l'll wait for you in the car.

51:59.198 --> 52:02.076
Don't take too long, though.

52:23.518 --> 52:27.033
- Won't you even sit close to me?
- Mm-mm.

52:27.118 --> 52:30.315
Not until you buy me somethin' pretty.

53:01.598 --> 53:03.589
<i>(sings "I Never Knew")</i>

53:37.038 --> 53:39.552
You didn't have to wait up for me.

53:39.638 --> 53:41.629
Shut that door.

53:47.718 --> 53:50.835
All I was doin'was just dancin'.

53:50.918 --> 53:52.909
Come here.

53:54.158 --> 53:56.149
Come here!

54:01.518 --> 54:03.509
You ain't mad, are you?

54:26.958 --> 54:28.949
Oh, dear God.

54:37.158 --> 54:39.547
Let's not kid ourselves. We're losing.

54:39.638 --> 54:43.472
She's in worse condition today
than when she walked in two years ago.

54:43.558 --> 54:47.836
- The divorce, you mean?
- No, it's more than that.

54:47.918 --> 54:51.433
I don't believe the divorce
actually affected her seriously.

54:51.838 --> 54:54.875
Bonnie's the only thing with her -
not Ralph or marriage.

54:55.358 --> 54:58.111
And that's the discouraging part of it.

54:58.198 --> 55:02.988
The truth is neither Eve Black nor Mrs White
is a satisfactory solution.

55:03.078 --> 55:06.832
Neither of them is really qualified
to fill the role of wife, mother,

55:06.918 --> 55:11.070
or even responsible human being.

55:11.158 --> 55:16.312
A victory for either would be disastrous.
No solution whatever.

55:16.398 --> 55:20.994
And as for memories, infancy, childhood...

55:21.838 --> 55:26.150
Perhaps I should say childhoods - she says
she's been coming out since she was six.

55:26.238 --> 55:29.787
...an empty, almost
abnormally normal history.

55:30.158 --> 55:35.027
- Some patients are really so inconsiderate.
- They are indeed.

55:35.118 --> 55:39.157
It wouldn't have hurt her to have had some
shocking experience when she was little.

55:39.238 --> 55:42.071
Something rather nasty she saw in the attic.

55:42.158 --> 55:44.149
<i>(buzzer)</i>

55:46.318 --> 55:48.752
<i>- Yes?
- Miss Black is here.</i>

55:48.838 --> 55:50.829
- Miss Black?
- Miss Eve Black.

55:50.918 --> 55:53.432
Tell him l'm all dyked out for him.

55:53.518 --> 55:57.477
She's all dressed up for you.
Very pretty, with flowers in her hair.

55:57.558 --> 56:01.437
- Miss Eve Black, in person.
- Want to try hypnosis again?

56:01.518 --> 56:05.113
You mean keep punting
and wait for a fumble?

56:06.198 --> 56:09.634
- How do you do, Miss Black?
- Well, both docs.

56:09.718 --> 56:11.993
You gonna protect him against me?

56:12.078 --> 56:15.229
The way you look this morning,
l'm not so sure he'd want me to.

56:15.318 --> 56:19.197
Well, say, you look pretty sharp yourself,
you know that?

56:19.278 --> 56:24.875
She's your patient, Doctor.
l'm much too old for that sort of thing.

56:25.838 --> 56:29.308
He's pretty cute sometimes, don't you think?

56:29.398 --> 56:32.595
He's a living doll. Will you come in?

56:32.678 --> 56:36.637
Maybe l'd like him better than I do you.

56:42.958 --> 56:46.997
- What's the idea of all this?
- I wouldn't let her come back.

56:47.078 --> 56:50.468
- Why not?
- Cos something's wrong.

56:51.278 --> 56:56.147
- You think so?
- Well, she tried to kill herself last night.

56:58.798 --> 57:01.392
Something's wrong somewhere.

57:06.838 --> 57:10.592
- How did she try to kill herself?
- With a razor blade.

57:10.678 --> 57:12.270
<i>She's feeling awfully low,</i>

57:12.358 --> 57:15.748
and when I got what she had in her mind,
it scared me half to death.

57:15.838 --> 57:19.148
Cos you know, if somebody
didn't stop her, l'd be gone too.

57:19.238 --> 57:22.310
- Go on.
- Well, wasn't anybody else there but me.

57:22.398 --> 57:27.677
So when she went in the bathroom
and she locked the door... Look.

57:29.798 --> 57:34.076
She made one slash and then I got out
and I made her drop the blade and...

57:34.158 --> 57:38.151
I got it and threw it away.
But it was a close call.

57:39.958 --> 57:43.871
- Do you think she meant it?
- I know she meant it.

57:43.958 --> 57:45.437
I wouldn't have meant it.

57:45.518 --> 57:48.954
I might be tryin' to scare somebody
or fool 'em or somethin',

57:49.038 --> 57:51.677
<i>but I wouldn't go that far.</i>

57:51.758 --> 57:54.431
- I understand.
- But she was really levelling.

57:54.518 --> 57:59.308
She really was gonna kill herself
if I hadn't stopped her.

58:02.318 --> 58:06.470
When you said there was
something wrong somewhere,

58:06.558 --> 58:09.709
did you mean something more
than the effort to kill herself?

58:09.798 --> 58:13.473
- I sure did.
- What?

58:13.558 --> 58:16.755
Now l'm havin' blackout spells too.

58:17.918 --> 58:21.149
You mean lapses of time when
you don't remember what's happened?

58:21.238 --> 58:24.071
And let me tell you, it scares me, too.

58:25.358 --> 58:27.826
- May I speak to Mrs White?
- Of course.

58:27.918 --> 58:29.909
Mrs White?

58:40.718 --> 58:44.188
Eve Black tells me you were very low.

58:47.638 --> 58:49.629
Yes, I was.

58:51.398 --> 58:54.993
Would you mind
going under hypnosis again?

58:55.918 --> 58:57.909
If you say so.

58:59.038 --> 59:01.154
All right. Now, relax.

59:01.238 --> 59:03.672
Completely.

59:03.758 --> 59:08.627
When I count to three,
you'll be in a deep hypnotic state.

59:08.718 --> 59:12.074
You understand? All right, now.

59:12.158 --> 59:13.591
One...

59:14.598 --> 59:18.068
Your eyelids are getting heavy.

59:18.158 --> 59:20.149
Very heavy.

59:21.598 --> 59:23.589
Two...

59:25.158 --> 59:27.592
Relax.

59:31.358 --> 59:32.586
Three.

01:00:10.998 --> 01:00:12.989
Who are you?

01:00:14.718 --> 01:00:17.027
Who do you think?

01:00:17.118 --> 01:00:19.109
I have no idea.

01:00:34.358 --> 01:00:36.155
<i>May I ask who you are?</i>

01:00:37.358 --> 01:00:40.077
I don't know that either.

01:00:43.918 --> 01:00:47.797
- Would you excuse me for a minute?
- Certainly.

01:01:00.798 --> 01:01:04.154
How's your heart?
Can you take another one?

01:01:04.238 --> 01:01:06.513
- You're kidding.
- Come on.

01:01:12.238 --> 01:01:14.798
- Do you remember Dr Day?
- How do you do, Doctor?

01:01:14.878 --> 01:01:17.836
- How do you do?
- Oh, well, then you must be Doctor...

01:01:17.918 --> 01:01:21.467
- Luther.
- Luther. Yes, of course. I should have known.

01:01:21.558 --> 01:01:26.188
- You mean you have heard of me?
- Yes, through both Eve White and Eve Black.

01:01:26.278 --> 01:01:27.791
Not unfavourably, I trust.

01:01:27.878 --> 01:01:31.507
On the contrary. They think
very highly of you, both of them.

01:01:31.598 --> 01:01:33.748
Are we to understand...?

01:01:33.838 --> 01:01:39.356
This is a little awkward, but are we to
understand that you're no longer Mrs White?

01:01:39.438 --> 01:01:41.588
- No, l'm not.
- Nor Eve Black?

01:01:41.678 --> 01:01:45.353
<i>- No.
- Then may I ask, what is your name?</i>

01:01:46.438 --> 01:01:48.076
I don't know.

01:01:48.158 --> 01:01:50.831
You do know Mrs White and Miss Black,
don't you?

01:01:50.918 --> 01:01:54.308
I know them in a way.
I don't think I know them very well.

01:01:54.398 --> 01:01:57.231
But you know they're...

01:01:57.318 --> 01:01:59.434
Yes, I understand that.

01:01:59.518 --> 01:02:02.635
It's a pretty bewildering thing, too, isn't it?

01:02:02.718 --> 01:02:07.428
I should say you were well within your rights
in so describing the situation.

01:02:07.518 --> 01:02:12.069
And may I add, it seems to grow
no less so with the passage of time.

01:02:12.158 --> 01:02:16.310
- I wish I understood it better.
- How long...?

01:02:16.398 --> 01:02:19.913
It's not easy to phrase these questions
without sounding like an idiot,

01:02:19.998 --> 01:02:26.187
but how long have you,
well, been around?

01:02:27.958 --> 01:02:32.827
I don't know. But I don't think
it could have been very long.

01:02:32.918 --> 01:02:38.072
- What do you know about Mrs White?
- Oh, what about Jane?

01:02:40.518 --> 01:02:43.430
- Jane who?
- I mean, for my name. Jane.

01:02:43.878 --> 01:02:45.914
Why Jane?

01:02:45.998 --> 01:02:48.432
Why not?

01:02:56.638 --> 01:02:59.550
<i>And so now Dr Luther had
three inadequate personalities</i>

01:02:59.638 --> 01:03:03.916
<i>to complicate and confuse his search
for one stable and complete woman,</i>

01:03:03.998 --> 01:03:07.911
<i>all of whom continued to live, so to speak,
their own separate lives.</i>

01:03:07.998 --> 01:03:12.150
<i>Which would it be?
The rollicking and irresponsible playgirl?</i>

01:03:12.238 --> 01:03:14.354
Hey, you cut that out.

01:03:14.438 --> 01:03:18.431
- I don't even know your first name.
- Ernie.

01:03:18.518 --> 01:03:21.112
<i>Ernie! (laughs)</i>

01:03:23.958 --> 01:03:25.596
<i>The defeated wife?</i>

01:03:25.678 --> 01:03:28.988
Hill Brothers. Yes, sir, just a minute.

01:03:31.038 --> 01:03:33.029
Hill Brothers.

01:03:34.798 --> 01:03:38.188
- Hill Brothers.
- Thank you for waiting.

01:03:43.158 --> 01:03:47.117
What? Well, just keep your britches on,
sugarfoot. l'll get your party for you.

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:50.508
Let me figure out which one it is.

01:03:50.598 --> 01:03:54.876
OK, that it?
What? Well, who are you?

01:03:54.958 --> 01:03:59.110
Well, honey, you're not the right one.
No, get off the line, you're not...

01:03:59.198 --> 01:04:02.668
Look, I don't care who you are.
Blast off, buster.

01:04:02.758 --> 01:04:05.591
<i>Or the pleasant young woman
who had no memory?</i>

01:04:05.678 --> 01:04:11.753
<i>What, in short, had nature, in the first place,
intended this woman to be?</i>

01:04:15.758 --> 01:04:19.307
- Not yet, Janie.
- What's the use, Earl?

01:04:21.198 --> 01:04:24.235
You did say you loved me, didn't you?

01:04:24.318 --> 01:04:26.309
Yes, I did.

01:04:27.278 --> 01:04:33.148
Well, then, is it fair to say you love me but
can't marry me, without telling me why not?

01:04:33.238 --> 01:04:37.993
- I just can't. I know it isn't fair. I just can't.
- What is it, honey?

01:04:38.078 --> 01:04:42.868
l'm not gonna let you get away with
anything like this. You've got to tell me.

01:04:42.958 --> 01:04:46.553
Please, Earl.
Just don't ask me any more. Please.

01:04:46.638 --> 01:04:49.710
l'm sorry, Janie, l've got to.

01:04:49.798 --> 01:04:54.667
I can't give you up
without even knowing what's the matter.

01:04:58.278 --> 01:05:00.872
All right, then. l'll tell you.

01:05:02.518 --> 01:05:09.071
Did you read in the newspaper about a month
ago about a multiple-personality case?

01:05:09.158 --> 01:05:12.389
A woman that has three personalities?

01:05:12.478 --> 01:05:14.946
<i>- In The Chronicle?
- Yes, that's the one.</i>

01:05:15.038 --> 01:05:18.872
- Yeah, I read it. What about it?
- l'm that woman.

01:05:20.438 --> 01:05:22.474
You're the...

01:05:22.558 --> 01:05:24.549
That's right.

01:05:27.758 --> 01:05:30.192
But you sound all right.

01:05:30.278 --> 01:05:32.951
- Do I?
- You sound fine.

01:05:34.238 --> 01:05:38.117
<i>Maybe I do, but not the other two.</i>

01:05:39.878 --> 01:05:41.789
Other two?

01:05:41.878 --> 01:05:46.668
Sure. There are two others, you know,
and they're very different from me.

01:05:46.758 --> 01:05:51.468
And I don't even ever know
when they're coming out.

01:05:51.558 --> 01:05:53.549
Holy Moses.

01:05:54.998 --> 01:05:57.558
- So that's all there is to it.
- Oh, no, it isn't.

01:05:57.638 --> 01:06:00.994
- Oh, please.
- Not by a long shot.

01:06:01.078 --> 01:06:04.912
What I mean is, that doesn't scare me.

01:06:05.918 --> 01:06:11.151
I feel just exactly the same.
Exactly as I felt before.

01:06:11.238 --> 01:06:14.947
I love you just exactly the same.

01:06:16.238 --> 01:06:18.229
Maybe even more.

01:06:19.318 --> 01:06:22.788
Whatever it is, we can handle it together.

01:06:23.918 --> 01:06:29.948
Earl, don't you understand?
It's not you marrying me.

01:06:30.038 --> 01:06:32.233
It's me marrying anybody.

01:06:34.638 --> 01:06:39.917
l'm sick. I am mentally sick
and I cannot marry anybody, ever.

01:06:46.078 --> 01:06:49.957
<i>Then, on the afternoon
of September 17th, 1953,</i>

01:06:50.038 --> 01:06:53.587
<i>Mrs White came to the office
for her regular treatment</i>

01:06:53.678 --> 01:06:55.669
<i>and died there.</i>

01:07:00.198 --> 01:07:02.189
How are you, Mrs White?

01:07:02.998 --> 01:07:04.989
I don't feel very well.

01:07:07.678 --> 01:07:11.148
Let's go inside and talk it over, shall we?

01:07:22.238 --> 01:07:24.593
You look tired.

01:07:24.678 --> 01:07:26.987
Yes, l'm very tired.

01:07:27.078 --> 01:07:29.228
I seem to be tired all the time now.

01:07:29.318 --> 01:07:32.993
Has the lively Miss Black
been keeping you out late?

01:07:33.078 --> 01:07:35.228
Yes, sir, I guess so.

01:07:35.318 --> 01:07:37.832
Anyway, I seem to be forgettin'
more than ever now.

01:07:37.918 --> 01:07:41.467
Well, that could also be Jane, you know.

01:07:41.558 --> 01:07:43.913
Yes, sir. I know.

01:07:43.998 --> 01:07:46.273
What do you think of Jane?

01:07:47.358 --> 01:07:50.236
Well, from what you've told me,

01:07:50.318 --> 01:07:52.707
I hope she'll be the one.

01:07:52.798 --> 01:07:55.551
- The one to what?
- To live.

01:07:57.318 --> 01:08:02.312
Is that what you think is going to happen?
That two of you will eventually disappear?

01:08:02.398 --> 01:08:04.389
Don't you?

01:08:05.398 --> 01:08:08.071
Well, I have thought so at times.

01:08:09.958 --> 01:08:12.677
Well, that's what I think.

01:08:12.758 --> 01:08:15.272
And I think it'll be Jane.

01:08:15.358 --> 01:08:17.553
At least, I hope so.

01:08:19.198 --> 01:08:22.270
Did you go up Sunday to see Bonnie?

01:08:22.358 --> 01:08:25.077
- Yes, sir.
- Did you have fun with her?

01:08:25.158 --> 01:08:27.546
I did for a while.

01:08:27.638 --> 01:08:30.470
Then I forgot for a while.

01:08:30.558 --> 01:08:33.834
Then I came back again, before I left.

01:08:34.758 --> 01:08:38.433
Then, when I was saying goodbye to Bonnie,

01:08:38.518 --> 01:08:43.990
she said to me 'Don't come back that other
way, Mommy. I don't like that other way.'

01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:45.557
Eve Black?

01:08:45.638 --> 01:08:49.153
I guess when I was up there last month
she must have come out,

01:08:49.238 --> 01:08:53.595
and she must have been cross with Bonnie
or slapped her or somethin'.

01:08:53.678 --> 01:08:58.798
But then she said "Come back this way,
Mommy. The way you are now."

01:08:58.877 --> 01:09:03.474
So I knew that it must have been Jane
that came out this time when I forgot.

01:09:03.558 --> 01:09:06.868
And she was sweet to Bonnie.

01:09:06.957 --> 01:09:11.907
But then when Papa
was driving me out of the yard,

01:09:11.997 --> 01:09:17.390
I got the strangest feeling that
I wasn't ever gonna see her again,

01:09:17.478 --> 01:09:20.276
that this was the last time.

01:09:21.678 --> 01:09:25.990
And I wanted to jump out of that truck
and go hug her.

01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:29.548
Try to explain to her and try to tell her...

01:09:32.558 --> 01:09:37.073
But I don't know.
How do you explain to a little girl?

01:09:37.158 --> 01:09:42.390
How do you make her understand that
her real mommy ain't never coming back,

01:09:42.478 --> 01:09:47.108
but another woman who just looks like her?

01:09:47.198 --> 01:09:51.555
Why do you think
you'll be one of the ones to go?

01:09:51.638 --> 01:09:54.311
It's just the way I feel, I guess.

01:09:54.398 --> 01:09:57.549
I don't really mind. Not any more.

01:09:58.518 --> 01:10:01.157
l'm not fit for her now.

01:10:01.238 --> 01:10:05.390
l'm not fit for anything, really. I know that.

01:10:05.478 --> 01:10:08.038
But if it's Jane...

01:10:08.118 --> 01:10:14.307
If she'll just understand how much
our little girl needs love and understanding,

01:10:14.398 --> 01:10:16.707
then I won't mind dyin'.

01:10:16.798 --> 01:10:19.517
You know, if she'll just
take good care of her for me.

01:10:21.398 --> 01:10:24.993
- May I speak to Jane now, please?
- Yes, sir.

01:10:25.558 --> 01:10:27.549
Jane?

01:10:34.878 --> 01:10:36.869
Good morning.

01:10:36.958 --> 01:10:38.949
Good morning.

01:10:40.758 --> 01:10:44.637
<i>It was me that came out on Sunday.</i>

01:10:44.718 --> 01:10:47.551
And while I was there,

01:10:48.518 --> 01:10:51.988
a curious thing happened
that I think you might be interested in.

01:10:52.078 --> 01:10:54.069
What was that?

01:10:55.838 --> 01:10:57.829
Well...

01:11:00.158 --> 01:11:02.149
Well, it was this.

01:11:02.998 --> 01:11:05.432
Bonnie and her mother
were out in the back yard.

01:11:05.518 --> 01:11:09.306
They were playing ball.
You know, bouncing a ball back and forth.

01:11:09.398 --> 01:11:11.832
Now, are you ready? All right.

01:11:11.918 --> 01:11:14.227
Here it comes.

01:11:14.318 --> 01:11:17.993
- Very good.
- Do it again, Mommy.

01:11:20.998 --> 01:11:22.989
OK, here we go.

01:11:25.318 --> 01:11:27.274
Uh-oh.

01:11:27.358 --> 01:11:32.955
- Look, it's under the house.
- That's all right, honey. l'll get it.

01:11:45.678 --> 01:11:49.876
You wait here, darling.
Mother will get it for you.

01:11:52.118 --> 01:11:54.109
Can you see it?

01:12:09.718 --> 01:12:14.314
<i>Then, when I got under there,
a strange thing happened.</i>

01:12:33.638 --> 01:12:36.277
<i>Suddenly, I was littler.</i>

01:12:36.358 --> 01:12:39.555
<i>I was a little girl under the house.</i>

01:12:39.638 --> 01:12:43.677
<i>I could smell the odour of fresh earth,
like a long time ago.</i>

01:12:43.758 --> 01:12:50.948
<i>And morning glories, though there are no
morning glories growing around there now.</i>

01:12:54.518 --> 01:12:58.067
And you still can't remember
anything at all about your childhood?

01:12:58.158 --> 01:13:00.353
No, not even of being a child.

01:13:00.438 --> 01:13:02.827
Do you think Eve White
might be able to remember it?

01:13:02.918 --> 01:13:06.069
- I have no idea.
- May I speak with her, please?

01:13:06.158 --> 01:13:08.149
Mrs White?

01:13:10.918 --> 01:13:14.115
Jane tells me that
when she came out up there on Sunday,

01:13:14.198 --> 01:13:17.076
when you were playing catch with Bonnie,

01:13:17.158 --> 01:13:22.278
the ball rolled under the house
and she went under after it.

01:13:22.358 --> 01:13:27.386
And when she got under there,
she had a feeling of being very small.

01:13:27.478 --> 01:13:28.991
A child.

01:13:29.078 --> 01:13:33.594
A very curious and somehow frightening
feeling, as if she'd been there before.

01:13:33.678 --> 01:13:36.829
Now, this had some meaning for her.

01:13:37.958 --> 01:13:44.750
Can you remember, when you were very little,
any experience like that of any kind?

01:13:47.478 --> 01:13:49.469
No, sir.

01:13:49.798 --> 01:13:56.988
Will you think back to when you were five or
six or seven years old, something like that?

01:13:58.358 --> 01:14:02.351
No, sir, I can't remember
anything like that under the house.

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:05.908
Perhaps under hypnosis?
Would you mind?

01:14:05.998 --> 01:14:08.034
No, sir. I don't mind.

01:14:08.118 --> 01:14:11.508
Will you close your eyes, please? Relax.

01:14:13.118 --> 01:14:15.109
One...

01:14:18.158 --> 01:14:20.149
Two...

01:14:23.718 --> 01:14:25.709
Three.

01:14:27.478 --> 01:14:30.948
Now, I want you to think back
to when you were five years old.

01:14:31.038 --> 01:14:33.950
Just a little girl on the farm.

01:14:34.038 --> 01:14:39.032
A very little girl
playing around the house in the back yard.

01:14:40.598 --> 01:14:44.477
Sometimes you play
under the house, don't you?

01:14:45.158 --> 01:14:47.433
Yes, sir.

01:14:47.518 --> 01:14:50.908
Did you ever go under the house for a ball?

01:14:52.838 --> 01:14:57.548
- I don't remember.
- Was it dark under the house?

01:14:57.638 --> 01:15:01.074
- Yes, sir, very dark.
- Did it scare you?

01:15:01.158 --> 01:15:03.194
No, sir.

01:15:03.278 --> 01:15:05.917
All right. Now you're six.

01:15:05.998 --> 01:15:08.637
Six years old.

01:15:08.718 --> 01:15:13.189
You're still playing around the house.
The back yard.

01:15:17.038 --> 01:15:20.314
You still go under the house sometimes?

01:15:21.678 --> 01:15:24.033
Yes.

01:15:24.118 --> 01:15:27.747
Now, can you remember one particular time

01:15:29.198 --> 01:15:34.147
when something happened to you
when you were under there?

01:15:34.238 --> 01:15:36.468
I don't want to, please...

01:15:37.358 --> 01:15:39.747
Did a ball go under the house?

01:15:41.118 --> 01:15:43.916
I want my cup...

01:15:43.998 --> 01:15:47.115
First give me my blue china cup.

01:15:47.198 --> 01:15:49.837
I want my cup.

01:15:49.918 --> 01:15:51.909
I don't want to.

01:15:52.918 --> 01:15:57.912
I don't like all those flowers.
Please, I don't want to.

01:15:57.998 --> 01:16:02.196
Mama, please, I don't want to.
There's too many people.

01:16:02.278 --> 01:16:05.111
Please... Mama, don't make me.

01:16:05.198 --> 01:16:07.587
Mama, please, don't make...

01:16:17.638 --> 01:16:21.028
- Mrs White?
- What were you doin' to her?

01:16:21.118 --> 01:16:24.394
- Eve?
- Of course. What are you tryin' to get at?

01:16:24.478 --> 01:16:29.677
l'll tell you. l'm interested in something that
Jane told me about being under the house,

01:16:29.758 --> 01:16:33.387
your mother's house, probably
when you were about six years old.

01:16:33.478 --> 01:16:37.027
It upset Mrs White very much.
Can you remember what it was?

01:16:37.118 --> 01:16:40.997
- I didn't pay much attention to anything then.
- You came out then, didn't you?

01:16:41.078 --> 01:16:45.390
Yeah. Only when I wanted to do
something she didn't want to do.

01:16:45.478 --> 01:16:50.472
Didn't she ever tell you about all those
lickings she got for things she didn't do?

01:16:50.558 --> 01:16:54.631
What are you doing out here now?
I didn't call you.

01:16:55.918 --> 01:16:59.797
I don't know. I just had to, I guess.

01:16:59.878 --> 01:17:03.075
Do you remember anything
about a blue china cup?

01:17:03.158 --> 01:17:07.037
I don't remember anything like that.
How long is this gonna go on?

01:17:07.118 --> 01:17:11.270
Until we find out what's the trouble,
of course.

01:17:11.358 --> 01:17:16.512
- How long do you think that's gonna be?
- I have no idea.

01:17:16.598 --> 01:17:18.873
You know what I think?

01:17:18.958 --> 01:17:21.313
What?

01:17:21.398 --> 01:17:24.276
I think l'm not havin' much fun any more.

01:17:24.358 --> 01:17:27.509
You're still getting out, aren't you?

01:17:27.598 --> 01:17:29.589
Not like I used to.

01:17:30.678 --> 01:17:33.476
Is it Jane that's doin' that to me?

01:17:35.438 --> 01:17:38.032
I don't know. What do you think?

01:17:41.038 --> 01:17:43.313
I wish I knew more about her.

01:17:44.758 --> 01:17:47.556
What do you want to know about her?

01:17:47.638 --> 01:17:50.914
I don't know. It's not like it used to be,

01:17:50.998 --> 01:17:55.992
when I knew all about Eve White
and she didn't know anything about me.

01:17:56.078 --> 01:17:58.546
That's the way I liked it.

01:17:58.638 --> 01:18:02.233
- It's all changed now, hasn't it?
- Mm-hm.

01:18:02.318 --> 01:18:04.912
Now there's Jane.

01:18:04.998 --> 01:18:06.795
Yeah.

01:18:09.278 --> 01:18:11.587
Do you like her?

01:18:11.678 --> 01:18:14.146
Very much.

01:18:14.238 --> 01:18:19.676
- More than you do me?
- I don't like anybody more than I do you.

01:18:19.758 --> 01:18:24.229
You never would go out
and have a good time with me, would you?

01:18:24.318 --> 01:18:30.268
A psychiatrist can't go out with a patient.
That's against the rules.

01:18:30.358 --> 01:18:34.715
Would you go out with me
if you wasn't a doctor?

01:18:34.798 --> 01:18:36.789
Anytime you'd let me.

01:18:42.598 --> 01:18:45.271
Does she know all about what I do?

01:18:46.238 --> 01:18:48.229
Does she tell you?

01:18:49.278 --> 01:18:51.394
When I ask her.

01:18:51.478 --> 01:18:54.197
Like about that sergeant?

01:18:54.278 --> 01:18:56.872
- Yes, she told me about that.
- That's what I mean.

01:18:56.958 --> 01:18:59.313
Somebody around all the time,
telling on you.

01:18:59.398 --> 01:19:03.676
- You tell me about Mrs White, don't you?
- Yeah, but she don't do anything.

01:19:09.238 --> 01:19:11.354
You know somethin', Doc?

01:19:11.438 --> 01:19:13.429
What?

01:19:14.158 --> 01:19:18.197
You remember that red dress?
The low-cut one?

01:19:18.998 --> 01:19:21.273
How could I forget it?

01:19:23.438 --> 01:19:25.952
I want you to have it.

01:19:27.078 --> 01:19:29.273
A low-cut dress, for me?

01:19:31.398 --> 01:19:35.755
I want you to have it if anything happens.

01:19:35.838 --> 01:19:39.035
What do you mean, if anything happens?

01:19:39.118 --> 01:19:41.791
Something's the matter.

01:19:41.878 --> 01:19:46.429
I don't know what it is,
but something's the matter.

01:19:46.518 --> 01:19:50.272
You don't think we're ever
going to get well, do you?

01:19:50.358 --> 01:19:52.349
Of course I do.

01:19:54.118 --> 01:19:56.109
Well, I don't.

01:19:57.238 --> 01:20:00.036
I think we're gonna die, all of us.

01:20:02.518 --> 01:20:04.509
Eve.

01:20:06.398 --> 01:20:11.597
- You didn't think I could cry, did you?
- You never have before.

01:20:16.318 --> 01:20:20.755
You know, I remember
the first time I ever saw you.

01:20:20.838 --> 01:20:26.515
You was the first one I ever said who I was.
First one ever knew me.

01:20:27.598 --> 01:20:30.158
You liked that red dress, didn't you?

01:20:30.238 --> 01:20:33.833
Very much indeed.
I think it's a beautiful dress.

01:20:33.918 --> 01:20:36.432
Well, I want you to have it.

01:20:36.518 --> 01:20:41.069
Cos you're the only one that knows
what it's meant to me. The only one.

01:20:42.118 --> 01:20:45.190
I know of nothing
that's gonna happen to you,

01:20:45.278 --> 01:20:48.987
but I do appreciate the dress, believe me.

01:20:50.798 --> 01:20:53.915
Now, may I speak to Jane?

01:20:55.598 --> 01:20:58.112
- Of course.
- Jane?

01:21:02.878 --> 01:21:04.630
Goodbye, Doc.

01:21:06.038 --> 01:21:07.596
Goodbye, Eve.

01:21:15.718 --> 01:21:17.709
Jane?

01:21:19.758 --> 01:21:21.988
Yes.

01:21:22.078 --> 01:21:24.353
What do you think she meant?

01:21:27.038 --> 01:21:29.313
I don't know.

01:21:29.398 --> 01:21:32.788
Have you remembered about
that blue china cup? Or under the house?

01:21:32.878 --> 01:21:35.676
- No.
- Mrs White?

01:21:37.238 --> 01:21:39.229
No!

01:21:42.678 --> 01:21:47.069
No, Mama! Mama, please don't make me!

01:21:47.158 --> 01:21:49.752
Please, please, please!

01:21:49.838 --> 01:21:53.387
Please don't make me,
Mama, please! Please don't...

01:21:53.478 --> 01:21:56.151
- Jane?
- Please, please!

01:21:57.118 --> 01:22:01.236
- What happened, Jane, under the house?
- She made me kiss her!

01:22:01.318 --> 01:22:03.912
She made me kiss her!

01:22:03.998 --> 01:22:05.909
Mama, please!

01:22:05.998 --> 01:22:08.990
<i>(children chant) l'll beat you! l'll beat you!</i>

01:22:10.518 --> 01:22:13.078
- l'll beat you!
- l'll beat you!

01:22:13.158 --> 01:22:15.433
Evie! Evie?

01:22:17.038 --> 01:22:21.236
- Come on, sugar, time to get your clothes on.
- l'll be there in a minute, Mama.

01:22:21.318 --> 01:22:23.878
Come on, Evie. I don't want to
come in there after you.

01:22:23.958 --> 01:22:26.756
You come on this minute, do you hear?

01:22:30.358 --> 01:22:32.349
You've got to kiss Grandma goodbye.

01:22:32.438 --> 01:22:35.635
Then you won't miss her so much
if you kiss her goodbye, sugar pie.

01:22:35.718 --> 01:22:37.709
You know that.

01:22:41.318 --> 01:22:45.027
Please don't make me.
I don't want to. Oh, Papa.

01:22:45.118 --> 01:22:48.588
Evie, darling. Evie,
you do like your mommy says.

01:22:48.678 --> 01:22:53.627
Come on, now, you give her to me.
I know, sugar. All you've got to do is kiss her.

01:22:53.718 --> 01:22:56.630
- Don't make me, please.
- Then you won't miss her so much.

01:22:56.718 --> 01:23:01.633
- Mama, I don't want to, Mama.
- You've got to kiss her goodbye.

01:23:01.718 --> 01:23:05.597
I don't want to. Please, Mama.

01:23:05.678 --> 01:23:08.238
<i>(sobs) Please, please! I don't want to.</i>

01:23:08.318 --> 01:23:12.106
Kiss her goodbye,
so you won't miss her so much.

01:23:12.198 --> 01:23:14.996
<i>(screams hysterically)</i>

01:23:21.798 --> 01:23:24.437
She didn't mean any wrong by it.

01:23:26.118 --> 01:23:30.157
It was just the way
people thought in those days.

01:23:30.238 --> 01:23:36.632
If you kissed the dead face, it was a sweet
goodbye and you wouldn't miss her so much.

01:23:36.718 --> 01:23:38.515
That's all she meant.

01:23:40.078 --> 01:23:43.548
Do you think a great deal about death now?

01:23:43.638 --> 01:23:45.754
No.

01:23:45.838 --> 01:23:47.829
Just that...

01:23:49.518 --> 01:23:54.512
"Life's a city full of straying streets,

01:23:54.598 --> 01:23:58.830
and death's the marketplace
where each one meets."

01:23:58.918 --> 01:24:01.432
Just that. Someday, it'll happen.

01:24:02.558 --> 01:24:04.992
Who wrote that? That poem?

01:24:05.998 --> 01:24:09.195
- Shakespeare, wasn't it?
- Where did you learn it?

01:24:09.278 --> 01:24:11.314
In high school.

01:24:11.398 --> 01:24:14.549
Mr Montgomery recited it to us one day.

01:24:14.638 --> 01:24:18.517
- Who was Mr Montgomery?
- The English teacher.

01:24:23.598 --> 01:24:29.594
Who was your first teacher? Your very first,
when you first started going to school?

01:24:29.678 --> 01:24:32.954
That was in Fortsville. Miss Bates.

01:24:33.998 --> 01:24:35.989
In the second grade?

01:24:42.438 --> 01:24:44.906
Miss Bates in the first grade.

01:24:47.318 --> 01:24:50.435
Miss Griffith in the second grade.

01:24:51.758 --> 01:24:55.637
Miss Stewart in the third grade.

01:24:56.438 --> 01:25:02.274
And... and then we moved to Richmond and
we had Miss Patterson in the fourth grade.

01:25:02.358 --> 01:25:04.667
Do you remember all of them?

01:25:04.758 --> 01:25:06.749
- May I say 'em?
- Go on.

01:25:07.718 --> 01:25:11.427
And in Richmond, we lived on Fifth Street.

01:25:13.358 --> 01:25:16.714
27 Fifth Street.

01:25:16.798 --> 01:25:19.596
Right next door to the Thompsons.

01:25:19.678 --> 01:25:22.954
Rick and Mary Lou Thompson.

01:25:23.038 --> 01:25:28.237
And... and Mr Thompson worked
at the railroad, in the machine shop.

01:25:28.318 --> 01:25:32.630
Because I remember one Sunday
he took us all down to look at the machines.

01:25:32.718 --> 01:25:36.188
Rick and Mary Lou and Florence and myself.

01:25:37.798 --> 01:25:40.915
Florence is my cousin.

01:25:42.238 --> 01:25:44.194
- I remember.
- May I speak to Mrs White?

01:25:45.718 --> 01:25:48.232
- Do you have to?
- Mrs White?

01:25:57.998 --> 01:26:00.273
She's gone.

01:26:00.358 --> 01:26:02.349
Eve?

01:26:04.238 --> 01:26:06.798
- They're gone.
- Eve Black?

01:26:06.878 --> 01:26:10.075
They're gone, I tell you. Both of them.

01:26:10.998 --> 01:26:14.434
They're gone and there's
nobody else here but me.

01:26:14.518 --> 01:26:17.316
I know it. I can feel it.

01:26:18.718 --> 01:26:23.189
And I can remember.
I can remember everything.

01:26:23.278 --> 01:26:25.587
Mama and Papa and Bonnie...

01:26:29.198 --> 01:26:31.348
I can remember.

01:26:32.198 --> 01:26:35.588
Oh, I can remember, I can remember.

01:26:37.558 --> 01:26:40.630
<i>That was in the fall of 1953.</i>

01:26:40.718 --> 01:26:43.835
<i>On September 17th, 1955,</i>

01:26:43.918 --> 01:26:50.710
<i>Dr Luther received a special-delivery
airmail letter from Richmond, Virginia.</i>

01:26:57.118 --> 01:26:59.393
<i>(Jane) "Dear Dr Luther,</i>

01:26:59.478 --> 01:27:02.197
<i>Do you remember what today is? "</i>

01:27:02.278 --> 01:27:06.351
<i>"It's the second anniversary
of that day in your office,</i>

01:27:06.438 --> 01:27:10.716
<i>and still no more Eve White
and no more Eve Black."</i>

01:27:10.798 --> 01:27:16.236
<i>"That's why we decided it was safe
at last to have Bonnie with us."</i>

01:27:16.318 --> 01:27:23.394
<i>"And so here we all are, Earl and Bonnie
and me, going home together."</i>
