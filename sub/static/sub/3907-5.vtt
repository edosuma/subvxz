-Prove it, go ahead. Get out of here.
-All right.

20:56.256 --> 20:57.621
Not what I meant.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.676
MAN ON RADIO:
Everything under control there?

21:07.767 --> 21:09.428
Yeah, we're good. Thanks.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.175
(CHUCKLES)

21:11.896 --> 21:14.228
-Thanks, Uncle Frank.
-Nah, nah, nah.

21:14.315 --> 21:16.021
Anything for you and Annabella, huh?

21:16.609 --> 21:20.147
-You taking care of our girl?
-Absolutely. That's my queen.

21:21.156 --> 21:23.818
Come on, new uniforms
for the department softball team.

21:25.326 --> 21:28.113
-All right. For the team. For the team.
-There you go.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.866
-(CAR ENGINE STARTS)
-Right? Check your fantasy league.

21:36.546 --> 21:39.913
I'm sorry, but I had no clue that
I had the Spencer Strasmore on the phone.

21:40.008 --> 21:41.589
-If I don't get an autograph for my nephew...
-Thank you.

21:41.676 --> 21:42.791
...I'II never hear the end of it.

21:42.886 --> 21:44.092
It'll be a pleasure. No problem.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.427
But first, we should take care
of a little business.

21:46.514 --> 21:48.425
Yeah, of course.

21:48.516 --> 21:50.131
So, you said you had more pictures.

21:50.226 --> 21:51.966
-My client does.
-Let's see 'em.

21:53.897 --> 21:56.229
Looks like everybody had a really good time.

22:15.668 --> 22:16.919
This woman, is she your client?

22:17.253 --> 22:18.504
Miss Angela Lee.

22:18.588 --> 22:21.295
She's already got an arm's-length deal
in place with an online publication.

22:21.382 --> 22:23.247
But against my counsel,

22:23.343 --> 22:26.176
she's insisted that
Vernon have a chance to max the bid.

22:26.679 --> 22:27.714
How much?

22:28.556 --> 22:29.796
Half a million dollars.

22:30.767 --> 22:32.803
(BOTH LAUGH)

22:32.894 --> 22:33.849
Okay.

22:33.937 --> 22:36.178
Half a million dollars
for pics of a defensive tackle?

22:36.272 --> 22:37.933
-Get the fuck out of here.
-Okay.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.015
-You're out of your fucking mind.
-All right, Max, we get it.

22:40.109 --> 22:41.690
You're setting the ceiling way up here

22:41.778 --> 22:43.814
so we can settle somewhere
down around there.

22:44.197 --> 22:46.108
We're just not gonna play that game, okay?

22:46.449 --> 22:50.863
So, I'm gonna write you a check right now
for 50 grand, all right?

22:50.954 --> 22:51.943
(LAUGHS)

22:52.080 --> 22:55.948
And that should take care of those pics
and any other ones she might have, all right?

22:56.584 --> 22:58.165
The price is $500,000.

22:59.003 --> 23:00.868
Hey, Vernon didn't do anything wrong.

23:01.673 --> 23:04.210
Yeah. He was getting stoned, okay?

23:04.300 --> 23:06.165
I mean, one way or another, we all do it.

23:06.261 --> 23:09.048
But not everybody gets caught
smoking an industrial-sized blunt

23:09.138 --> 23:10.548
surrounded by naked cokeheads

23:10.640 --> 23:13.882
at a party being hosted
by Anderson Financial, Joe.

23:14.018 --> 23:19.138
All the while, he's trying to renegotiate
his multimillion-dollar deal with the Cowboys.

23:19.482 --> 23:20.471
(CHUCKUNG)

23:21.985 --> 23:23.941
So, Maximo wants to play hardball.

23:24.028 --> 23:26.019
Hey, the world's a cynical place, Spencer.

23:26.114 --> 23:28.446
I mean, Ms. Lee could spin this
any way she chooses to.

23:28.533 --> 23:30.524
Clearly there was sex and drugs involved.

23:30.618 --> 23:34.327
I mean, who knows? Maybe there was
prostitutes and underage girls there, too.

23:34.497 --> 23:35.486
(LAUGHS)

23:35.582 --> 23:37.573
I feel like I really need to take
a fucking shower.

23:37.667 --> 23:39.578
-How about you, Joe?
-I feel gross.

23:39.669 --> 23:42.456
Plus, Anderson Financial
would not be pleased

23:42.547 --> 23:45.004
knowing that this happened
at a party that they hosted.

23:45.842 --> 23:47.332
That was a corporate event.

23:48.428 --> 23:50.919
I know you don't wanna jeopardize
Vernon's job or your own

23:51.014 --> 23:52.629
by not taking me seriously.

23:54.892 --> 23:55.881
(CHUCKLES)

23:56.853 --> 23:58.889
Maximo means business, boys.

23:59.147 --> 24:01.638
My namesake was a commander
in the Cuban War of Independence.

24:01.733 --> 24:05.851
His army lacked munitions,
so he invented the machete charge.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.739
His troops would attack the enemy
with machetes,

24:08.865 --> 24:11.106
hacking up anybody foolish enough
to challenge them,

24:11.200 --> 24:14.237
forcing the rest to retreat out of fear.

24:15.330 --> 24:17.036
That's pretty much how I like to operate.

24:18.082 --> 24:20.459
Well, you better start sharpening
your machetes.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.581
'Cause I never fucking retreat.

24:25.214 --> 24:27.205
And that's how I like to operate.

24:30.762 --> 24:33.219
Half a million dollars. Is she serious?

24:33.723 --> 24:36.840
What kind of lying, thieving,
money-grubbing bitch

24:36.934 --> 24:39.311
tries to shake down a sweetheart like Vernon?

24:41.189 --> 24:42.725
I know her, Joe.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.146
