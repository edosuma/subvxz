00:18.693 --> 00:20.860
Thank you, Stan. You're too kind.

00:23.531 --> 00:26.700
Stan, has anyone ever told you

00:26.701 --> 00:29.402
that you bear an uncanny resemblance

00:29.403 --> 00:31.821
in profile to the Duke of Windsor?

00:31.822 --> 00:33.740
No, I haven't heard that, Mr. Blunt.

00:33.741 --> 00:36.743
Oh, I'm surprised. You have his mouth.

00:36.744 --> 00:40.463
- Have you ever studied that era, Stan?
- No.

00:40.464 --> 00:43.383
Wally Simpson was perhaps

00:43.384 --> 00:46.052
the greatest woman of the 20th century.

00:46.053 --> 00:47.587
Why is that, Mr. Blunt?

00:47.588 --> 00:50.423
Because she was an American divorcée

00:50.424 --> 00:52.759
who almost became Queen of England.

00:52.760 --> 00:56.429
Nearly brought down the whole fucking House
of Windsor by herself.

00:56.430 --> 00:58.431
Well, I did not know that.

00:58.432 --> 01:01.067
Edward, the Duke of Windsor,

01:01.068 --> 01:04.321
he gave up his throne for her.

01:04.322 --> 01:06.606
She was strong.

01:06.607 --> 01:08.692
He was weak.

01:08.693 --> 01:09.693
Total mess.

01:09.694 --> 01:14.748
That was a fascinating and dangerous time.

01:14.749 --> 01:18.702
They were very friendly with Jimmy
Donahue, the Woolworth heir.

01:18.703 --> 01:22.622
Jimmy was a somewhat erratic homosexual.

01:24.792 --> 01:27.544
One time in New York,

01:27.545 --> 01:30.046
Jimmy was shaving the...

01:30.047 --> 01:32.632
sex organs of a soldier

01:32.633 --> 01:35.218
and by mistake he lopped off his balls.

01:35.219 --> 01:38.722
Left the poor fellow like an
orphan by the Brooklyn Bridge.

01:38.723 --> 01:41.725
A soldier? Oh, I don't like to hear that.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.026
My father served.

01:43.027 --> 01:44.894
Oh, yes. Poor, poor lad.

01:44.895 --> 01:46.563
But he made it to a hospital

01:46.564 --> 01:47.897
and it cost Jimmy's mother

01:47.898 --> 01:49.733
a quarter of a million dollars,

01:49.734 --> 01:52.869
which is not enough for
having lost your testicles.

01:52.870 --> 01:55.288
But in those days it was.

01:55.289 --> 01:57.374
Well, it was the Depression.

01:57.375 --> 01:59.709
Quite. Supposedly, though,

01:59.710 --> 02:02.462
Jimmy could be very charming.

02:02.463 --> 02:04.631
Unless you were a soldier.

02:08.636 --> 02:11.721
Mr. Blunt. I saw your show tonight.

02:11.722 --> 02:13.423
Thank you.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.724
You may be the only one who did.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.765
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine!

02:24.268 --> 02:27.103
I just need to adjust my mask.

02:27.104 --> 02:28.938
It keeps on slipping.

02:31.889 --> 02:33.522
All better now.

02:40.117 --> 02:42.752
Stan, where's Harry?

02:42.753 --> 02:45.421
I don't know, Mr. Blunt.

02:48.125 --> 02:52.262
Mr. Blunt. Why don't you stay
and have a cup of coffee?

02:52.263 --> 02:55.181
Mr. Daniel Craig and Mr. Jeffrey Katzenberg

02:55.182 --> 02:56.716
are just finishing their dessert.

02:56.717 --> 02:59.936
Oh, dear Jeffrey. One of the good guys.

02:59.937 --> 03:03.890
Give him my regards, but I'm
going home to beddy-byes.

03:03.891 --> 03:05.892
Would you like Stan to call you a car?

03:05.893 --> 03:08.361
I am concerned.

03:08.362 --> 03:10.563
I'm okay, Phil.

03:10.564 --> 03:14.617
Don't forget, I am Walter Blunt.

04:07.788 --> 04:09.756
Excuse me, miss.

04:09.757 --> 04:12.459
Is everything all right?

04:12.460 --> 04:15.128
- Yeah, you want a date?
- I beg your pardon?

04:15.129 --> 04:17.046
Lower the shitty-ass music.

04:18.382 --> 04:19.882
I said do you want a date?

04:19.884 --> 04:24.637
Are you a lady of the night? A courtesan?

04:24.638 --> 04:26.389
Look, I don't know what
you're talking about, okay?

04:26.390 --> 04:28.057
I'm a goddess and I'm a fucking model.

04:28.058 --> 04:30.226
Now do you want to go on
a date with me or not?

04:30.227 --> 04:33.562
Sure, I'd like to go on a date.

04:39.370 --> 04:41.538
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:41.539 --> 04:44.623
Just go down a few blocks.
I know a good spot.

05:03.427 --> 05:04.928
Would you like some whiskey?

05:04.929 --> 05:07.897
Or marijuana chocolate? I have both.

05:07.898 --> 05:11.684
Slow down, baby. Look, we should
probably talk business first.

05:11.685 --> 05:14.687
Do you know what type of girl I am?

05:14.688 --> 05:18.358
Well, you said you were
a goddess and a model.

05:18.359 --> 05:20.276
I'm a transsexual.

05:20.277 --> 05:22.278
Do you know what that means?

05:22.279 --> 05:26.282
Oh, yes. I was at the US Open in '77

05:26.283 --> 05:27.867
when Renée Richards made her debut.

05:27.868 --> 05:31.788
But I would never have guessed that of you,

05:31.789 --> 05:34.174
which I hope you don't mind me saying.

05:34.175 --> 05:35.792
No, it's okay.

05:35.793 --> 05:40.713
Most people just assume
I'm a biological girl,

05:40.714 --> 05:42.215
- or whatever that means.
- Ah.

05:42.216 --> 05:46.052
And does that mean that
you have an intact penis?

05:46.053 --> 05:49.137
Why don't we just say
I have a nine-inch clit?

05:50.641 --> 05:52.475
Does that bother you?

05:52.476 --> 05:54.060
No.

05:54.061 --> 05:55.778
I'm English.

05:55.779 --> 05:59.532
Okay, so what do you want to do?

05:59.533 --> 06:04.237
Um, might I nurse on your breast?

06:04.238 --> 06:07.323
Things have not been
going well for me at work

06:07.324 --> 06:10.710
and at home and...

06:10.711 --> 06:13.796
to suckle would be a great comfort.

06:13.797 --> 06:16.666
You just want to kiss on my titties?

06:16.667 --> 06:19.051
Yes. That would be lovely.

06:26.677 --> 06:28.478
See there?

06:28.479 --> 06:30.263
No implants.

06:30.264 --> 06:32.765
Just au naturel.

06:32.766 --> 06:35.818
Titties grown from hormones

06:35.819 --> 06:38.354
and healthy eating.

06:38.355 --> 06:41.690
The world has changed so much.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.611
- May I?
- Sure.

06:46.614 --> 06:49.532
Oh. Lord, the seat belt.

06:49.533 --> 06:51.366
Oh.

06:55.372 --> 06:57.624
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't ask.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.208
What's your name, my dear?

06:59.209 --> 07:01.044
Gisele.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.763
I know we've only just met, Gisele,

07:03.764 --> 07:07.717
but I like you very much.

07:07.718 --> 07:10.302
Thank you for being kind to me.

07:11.805 --> 07:13.605
I like you, too.

07:24.034 --> 07:26.202
<i>This is the LAPD!</i>

07:26.203 --> 07:28.905
Oh, no. Walter, I got to make a run for it.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.573
I can't get arrested.
My mom will freak out.

07:30.574 --> 07:32.375
No Gisele!

07:33.794 --> 07:35.712
Hey! Come here!

07:35.713 --> 07:38.247
Put your hands on the car.

07:38.248 --> 07:39.916
Hey, you're being too rough.

07:39.917 --> 07:42.085
We have a celebrity and a
prostitute resisting arrest.

07:42.086 --> 07:44.804
- You're hurting my arm.
- Let her go, Officer.

07:44.805 --> 07:45.922
Stand down, sir.

07:45.923 --> 07:47.724
- Put your hands on the car.
- Ow!

07:47.725 --> 07:49.091
- Hey.
- Don't fucking touch me.

07:51.595 --> 07:54.430
Oh, shit.

07:54.431 --> 07:56.432
Run, Gisele. Save yourself.

07:57.601 --> 07:59.402
Is he all right, Officer?

07:59.403 --> 08:01.270
On the ground now!

08:16.453 --> 08:18.254
Get off the car, Mr. Blunt.

08:18.255 --> 08:20.623
No! Everyone go away!

08:20.624 --> 08:22.342
Mr. Blunt, you have to get off of that car.

08:22.343 --> 08:23.626
You are in serious trouble.

08:23.627 --> 08:25.044
I will not get down.

08:25.045 --> 08:27.764
I need Harry!

08:27.765 --> 08:30.099
Sweetheart, just get down.
They'll shoot you.

08:30.100 --> 08:33.720
Gisele, I'm so sorry
you had to witness this.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.772
We did nothing wrong.

08:35.773 --> 08:37.724
I know, baby. Just please get down.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.275
It is time to get down
from the car, Mr. Blunt.

08:39.275 --> 08:41.693
Whoa! Hey, whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, who's that?

08:41.695 --> 08:43.445
<i>Hands up! Hands up!</i>

08:45.115 --> 08:47.150
Major.

08:47.151 --> 08:50.987
You seem to have found
yourself in a spot of bother.

08:50.988 --> 08:54.290
Harry, there you are. Where have you been?

08:54.291 --> 08:56.376
I was passed out on the backseat, sir.

08:56.377 --> 09:00.129
But you better get down from there.
You're surrounded.

09:00.130 --> 09:02.999
It's the Falklands all over again, Harry.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.584
By land, by sea.

09:04.585 --> 09:07.670
Mr. Blunt, get down from the car.

09:07.671 --> 09:09.305
I don't feel well, Harry.

09:09.306 --> 09:11.507
I ate some chocolate marijuana

09:11.508 --> 09:13.176
and it's starting to kick in.

09:13.177 --> 09:16.062
My feet are vibrating
and my thoughts are odd.

09:16.063 --> 09:19.265
I have told you edibles
are dangerous, Major.

09:19.266 --> 09:22.735
You have to think of them
as time-release vitamins.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.320
Take very little.

09:24.321 --> 09:25.855
"O Gertrude, Gertrude,"

09:25.856 --> 09:29.075
when sorrows come,
they come not single spies,

09:29.076 --> 09:32.278
- "but in battalions!"
- Mr. Blunt!

09:32.279 --> 09:34.363
This is not the audience
for "Hamlet," Major.

09:34.364 --> 09:36.749
It's not?

09:36.750 --> 09:39.751
<i>♪</i>

09:50.764 --> 09:52.882
Is it true that you sent
a policeman to the hospital?

09:52.883 --> 09:54.934
What will this mean to your career?

09:54.935 --> 09:56.886
Do you have the prostitute's phone number?

09:56.887 --> 09:59.105
Have you spoken to any of your wives?

09:59.106 --> 10:03.025
I have not spoken to any of my ex-wives.

10:03.026 --> 10:04.777
This is the benefit of divorce.

10:04.778 --> 10:07.563
When you've been arrested,
you're not expected to call.

10:07.564 --> 10:11.033
Mr. Blunt, how old was the prostitute?

10:11.034 --> 10:13.034
Are you an American citizen?

10:31.221 --> 10:32.588
Harry.

10:32.589 --> 10:35.758
You just have to face them, Major.

10:35.759 --> 10:38.894
Rally the troops and all that.

10:44.401 --> 10:45.935
Thank you, Harry.

10:45.936 --> 10:48.237
God, my bloody head is killing me.

10:48.238 --> 10:50.072
Do your best, Major.

10:50.073 --> 10:53.442
I'll be in your office consulting
with our commanding officer.

11:23.524 --> 11:27.527
I haven't dared look at my phone.
How bad is it?

11:27.528 --> 11:29.562
It's a shitstorm, Walter.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.447
You fucked yourself real good.

11:31.448 --> 11:33.733
You're getting slammed
from every direction.

11:33.734 --> 11:37.453
"New York Times," O'Reilly,
Anderson Cooper.

11:37.454 --> 11:38.988
Martin?

11:38.989 --> 11:40.573
Here's the full quote

11:40.574 --> 11:42.458
from O'Reilly's radio show this morning.

11:42.459 --> 11:45.628
"This Brit who had the
audacity to come to the US"

11:45.629 --> 11:48.297
preaching to us about the death
penalty and immigration,

11:48.298 --> 11:50.800
flouting his credentials
as a former Royal Marine

11:50.801 --> 11:53.052
"wounded in the Falklands is a..."

11:53.053 --> 11:55.137
Did he say Falklands sarcastically?

11:55.138 --> 11:56.589
Uh...

11:56.590 --> 12:00.643
his tone was, um, dismissive.

12:00.644 --> 12:03.479
Go on.

12:03.480 --> 12:04.931
Going on.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.984
"...is a moral imbecile
and a sexual degenerate."

12:07.985 --> 12:10.820
God.

12:10.821 --> 12:12.905
What did Anderson Cooper say?

12:12.906 --> 12:15.575
He's always been a nice lad.

12:15.576 --> 12:17.193
Read it, Shelly.

12:17.194 --> 12:19.612
Anderson Cooper did a four-part tweet.

12:19.613 --> 12:22.531
"Walter Blunt's sexuality
is not the issue here."

12:22.532 --> 12:25.368
The issues are drunk driving, the
assault of a Los Angeles policeman,

12:25.369 --> 12:28.037
and most horribly,
the corruption of a minor

12:28.038 --> 12:30.373
"forced into prostitution."

12:30.374 --> 12:32.091
Gisele was a minor?

12:32.092 --> 12:34.710
Well, no, but that's out there now.
I mean, she's actually 21.

12:34.711 --> 12:35.878
Which means, and this is positive,

12:35.879 --> 12:37.597
she started puberty years ago.

12:37.598 --> 12:39.432
I started puberty when I was
11, which was a nightmare.

12:39.433 --> 12:40.883
I was in a little yellow school skirt...

12:40.884 --> 12:44.270
So, Gisele is 21. That's wonderful.

12:44.271 --> 12:47.273
That's nearly a 50-year
age difference, Walter.

12:47.274 --> 12:50.559
With a prostitute. What the
hell were you thinking?

12:50.560 --> 12:53.062
Can I just be relieved for one moment

12:53.063 --> 12:54.779
that she's not 16?

12:57.618 --> 13:00.569
I'm... I'm so sorry, everyone.

13:00.570 --> 13:02.705
I'm exhausted.

13:02.706 --> 13:06.292
Jail was ghastly.

13:06.293 --> 13:09.412
And, as you all know,
I don't like to share a loo.

13:09.413 --> 13:12.581
We understand. We all have bathroom issues.

13:12.582 --> 13:16.719
Yeah, I don't even like
to share a loo with myself.

13:16.720 --> 13:18.254
But I have to.

13:18.255 --> 13:21.724
Right, what's the situation internally?

13:21.725 --> 13:23.843
Well, Gardner said they're either
looking to cancel the show,

13:23.844 --> 13:27.430
which with our ratings they'd be
looking to do anyway, the bastards,

13:27.431 --> 13:28.931
or suspend you.

13:28.932 --> 13:31.767
But what about tonight?
We can broadcast tonight?

13:31.768 --> 13:33.602
You have a meeting
with Gardner in 20 minutes,

13:33.603 --> 13:36.439
but he's probably just gonna
yell at you and fire you.

13:36.440 --> 13:40.609
Jim, do you think you could not be
pessimistic just for five minutes?

13:40.610 --> 13:41.777
I'll try.

13:41.778 --> 13:43.746
So, I'm gonna shower,

13:43.747 --> 13:45.865
change my clothes, face Gardner,

13:45.866 --> 13:48.784
and we are going to turn this around.

13:48.785 --> 13:50.920
Walter, I'm really worried.

13:50.921 --> 13:53.039
I think this might be the end.

13:53.040 --> 13:56.592
Look, I know I have let you all down.

13:56.593 --> 14:00.346
But please don't quit on me.

14:00.347 --> 14:02.097
Not yet.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.550
I need you.

14:15.112 --> 14:17.196
Oh, Major.

14:17.197 --> 14:19.815
Just 10 more lashes, Harry.

14:19.816 --> 14:22.868
My hangover is nearly gone.

14:22.869 --> 14:25.537

14:26.740 --> 14:28.623

14:30.077 --> 14:32.795
You've been unclean, Major!

14:33.964 --> 14:36.716
Very unclean!

14:36.717 --> 14:38.718
A naughty...

14:38.719 --> 14:40.720

14:40.721 --> 14:42.922
...boy!

14:47.594 --> 14:50.813

14:50.814 --> 14:53.816

14:53.817 --> 14:55.568
"but in battalions!"

14:55.569 --> 14:56.685
Mr. Blunt...

14:56.686 --> 14:58.687
On top of everything else
you pulled last night,

14:58.688 --> 15:01.741
you managed to stand on the
roof of your vintage Jag.

15:01.742 --> 15:02.942
How high were you?

15:02.943 --> 15:05.244
I know it looks bad, Bob.

15:05.245 --> 15:09.532
But I beg you, let me on the air tonight.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.918
Let me plead my case
to the American people.

15:12.919 --> 15:14.620
No. Why should I?

15:14.621 --> 15:19.258
Because I have given you the
last five years of my life.

15:19.259 --> 15:20.760
I don't care, Walter.

15:20.761 --> 15:22.711
You are facing felony charges.

15:22.712 --> 15:25.047
Your ratings have been shit for months

15:25.048 --> 15:26.382
and your frontal lobes
have turned to raisins.

15:26.383 --> 15:27.883
All that's left is your accent.

15:27.884 --> 15:29.435
Just because a man's ratings slip

15:29.436 --> 15:32.605
doesn't mean his frontal
lobes are dissolving.

15:32.606 --> 15:34.440
What if I...

15:34.441 --> 15:37.026
What if I had a priest absolve me on air?

15:37.027 --> 15:38.778
- Are you still drunk?
- Rabbi?

15:38.779 --> 15:41.564
Seriously? You are the
face of this network.

15:41.565 --> 15:43.282
I'm going to take your billboard down.

15:43.283 --> 15:45.034
No! No.

15:45.035 --> 15:48.620

15:51.124 --> 15:56.078
what if I gave you my Jaguar

15:56.079 --> 16:00.749
in exchange for one more broadcast?

16:00.750 --> 16:03.551
I've seen the way you look
at her in the parking lot.

16:10.594 --> 16:13.095
Gardner is letting me on the air.

16:13.096 --> 16:15.764
Bullshit. I don't believe you.

16:15.765 --> 16:17.766
Why? He's a perfectly reasonable man.

16:17.767 --> 16:21.403
We had a good talk. But they
need me to see a shrink

16:21.404 --> 16:23.355

16:23.356 --> 16:26.075
If you want, I know how
to mislead therapists.

16:26.076 --> 16:27.359
My dad's a Gestaltian.

16:27.360 --> 16:29.361
That won't be an issue, Jim.

16:29.362 --> 16:31.864
They think my frontal lobes are shot,

16:31.865 --> 16:33.449
which is ludicrous!

16:33.450 --> 16:35.751
I mean, only yesterday
I did the "Times" crossword.

16:35.752 --> 16:37.620
And it was a Thursday.

16:37.621 --> 16:40.122
<i>Walter, I'm afraid
I've got some more bad news.</i>

16:40.123 --> 16:42.625
The cop that you kicked
has ruptured testicles.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.793
- Does that mean he can't have children?
- I don't know.

16:44.794 --> 16:46.846
What happens to testes
when they've been shattered?

16:46.847 --> 16:48.464
Do you think it's like cracking an egg?

16:48.465 --> 16:50.766
It's weird 'cause eggs
are quite like testicles.

16:50.767 --> 16:52.801
Somebody Google ruptured testicles.

16:52.802 --> 16:54.186
- I'm on it.
- I'm on it.

16:54.187 --> 16:56.472
<i>Okay, tonight's program.</i>

16:56.473 --> 16:58.774
I think we have to address what happened.

16:58.775 --> 17:01.527
I think we should get Barbara
Walters to interview me.

17:01.528 --> 17:03.362
I cry easily. She'll love that.

17:03.363 --> 17:05.647
- She'll never do it.
- Charlie Rose.

17:05.648 --> 17:07.867
You snubbed him at the White
House Correspondents' Dinner

17:07.867 --> 17:09.535
and he sent an emotional email.

17:09.536 --> 17:12.704
Oh, God, yes. You're right. David Frost.

17:12.705 --> 17:14.573
- Dead.
- Shit.

17:14.574 --> 17:18.294
Walter, ruptured testicles
can cause infertility.

17:18.295 --> 17:20.713
God.

17:20.714 --> 17:23.582
They'll say I castrated a policeman.

17:23.583 --> 17:27.218
Walter, do you want to spoon?

17:28.638 --> 17:32.508
Yes. That would be very reassuring.
Thank you, Rosalie.

17:32.509 --> 17:35.394
Walter, could I spoon with you this time?

17:35.395 --> 17:37.146
I mean, I am a senior producer.

17:37.147 --> 17:38.731
It would be inappropriate.

17:38.732 --> 17:42.351
Rosalie has been with me for 20 years.

17:42.352 --> 17:43.651
Course. Sorry.

17:46.606 --> 17:48.857
But what are we going to do?

17:48.858 --> 17:53.078
If only we could get Oprah
to make all this go away.

17:53.079 --> 17:57.700
Walter, I believe in you absolutely,

17:57.701 --> 18:01.620

to go out there on your own.

18:25.562 --> 18:28.030
No, Martin. We'll split the screen,

18:28.031 --> 18:29.865
we'll tape the questions beforehand.

18:29.866 --> 18:32.451
Major, the network psychiatrist
is in your office.

18:32.452 --> 18:34.286

18:34.287 --> 18:37.072

my lawyer has sprung Gisele.

18:44.414 --> 18:47.249
Walter. Walter, are you sure you want to do

18:47.250 --> 18:49.718
this whole self-interrogation thing?

18:49.719 --> 18:53.422
I think it just might make
you seem a little crazy.

18:53.423 --> 18:56.558
No, no, I see it as a vision.

18:56.559 --> 18:59.728
- My two selves talking like a Buñuel movie.
- Mmm.

18:59.729 --> 19:01.930
No, my biggest concern is fatigue.

19:01.931 --> 19:04.516
I'm totally fucked.

19:04.517 --> 19:05.934
Here.

19:05.935 --> 19:07.603
Take these.

19:07.604 --> 19:09.605
- It's Provigil.
- What's Provigil?

19:09.606 --> 19:12.775
It's a kind of speed. It's very effective.

19:12.776 --> 19:14.910
I used to be wildly addicted.

19:14.911 --> 19:17.613
But, um, I'm better now. Sort of.

19:17.614 --> 19:20.749
Oh, well, thank you.
I've always enjoyed uppers.

19:20.750 --> 19:22.700
All right.

19:25.255 --> 19:27.622
- Sorry.
- That's no problem.

19:29.509 --> 19:31.293
Do you always bring your own couch, Doctor?

19:31.294 --> 19:33.594
Yes. I'm a Freudian.

19:36.633 --> 19:39.802

What happened last night?

19:39.803 --> 19:43.272
To be frank, I'm drinking
more than I should.

19:43.273 --> 19:46.641
Recently divorced for the fourth time.

19:47.977 --> 19:49.945

19:49.946 --> 19:51.697
We have a five-year-old boy.

19:51.698 --> 19:53.782
And how old is your ex-wife?

19:53.783 --> 19:55.451
She's 35.

19:55.452 --> 19:57.368
That's very nice.

19:58.788 --> 20:00.572
And what else may have contributed

20:00.573 --> 20:02.708
to last night's behavior?

20:02.709 --> 20:05.377
Uh, I think, um...

20:05.378 --> 20:07.129
oh, I'm sorry.

20:07.130 --> 20:10.716
I'm feeling a bit woozy, Doctor.

20:10.717 --> 20:14.053
Probably stress. Or oral anxiety.

20:14.054 --> 20:16.255
- Oral anxiety?
- Could be.

20:16.256 --> 20:17.806
What were you going to say?

20:17.807 --> 20:20.392
It's just that...

25:54.727 --> 25:57.479
- <i>My first question...</i>
- This is crazy.

25:57.480 --> 26:00.766
Was the beautiful young woman with
whom you were arrested a minor?

26:00.767 --> 26:02.651
Absolutely not.

26:02.652 --> 26:05.237
No, that is a spurious
and slanderous rumor.

26:05.238 --> 26:07.572
She is 21 years of age.

26:07.573 --> 26:09.858
She can vote, she can drink, she can drive.

26:09.859 --> 26:13.695
She can... well, she can do many things.

26:13.696 --> 26:15.747
<i>Do you think it would be fair to say</i>

26:15.748 --> 26:19.868
that you have been sexually
out of control all your life?

26:19.869 --> 26:22.704
Well, I... You see...

26:22.705 --> 26:26.425
I have been sexually out
of control all of my life.

26:26.426 --> 26:29.544
- Why?!
- I don't know.

26:29.545 --> 26:31.263
- Why?!
- I...

26:31.264 --> 26:33.715
I don't even know what sex means anymore.

26:33.716 --> 26:35.717
- Why?!
- I've lost my way. You know that.

26:35.718 --> 26:37.219
- Why?!
- Please, stop.

26:37.220 --> 26:40.055
Stop making him say why.
Throw him a softball.

26:40.056 --> 26:41.389
Sorry.

26:41.390 --> 26:44.726
You shattered the testicles
of a police officer.

26:44.727 --> 26:45.777
How did this happen?

26:45.778 --> 26:48.363
You see, I believed I was under attack.

26:48.364 --> 26:53.068
But I will give that officer
half a million dollars

26:53.069 --> 26:55.570
in compensation for his injuries.

26:55.571 --> 26:59.458
Now, in the '30s, the Woolworth family
gave a quarter of a million dollars

26:59.459 --> 27:02.377
to a soldier for a set of lost testicles.

27:02.378 --> 27:05.747
What the hell is he talking about?
Next question.

27:05.748 --> 27:07.415
...but half a million seems fair.

27:07.416 --> 27:10.085
How should you be punished
for what you've done?

27:10.086 --> 27:13.922
Isn't drunk driving the
equivalent of attempted murder?

27:13.923 --> 27:16.424
- Murder?
- Answer the question.

27:16.425 --> 27:19.845
Whatever punishment they
determine, I will accept.

27:19.846 --> 27:22.430
But I want to say this
to the American people...

27:22.431 --> 27:25.734
- Walter!
- No, Mr. Blunt, I will not be bullied by you.

27:25.735 --> 27:29.688
After the Falklands War
in which I lost men,

27:29.689 --> 27:34.276
I vowed never to stop
fighting for what is right.

27:34.277 --> 27:37.696
And it is for this reason that
I joined the Fourth Estate.

27:37.697 --> 27:38.947
I became a journalist.

27:38.948 --> 27:42.951
Yes, I know I faltered because of ego

27:42.952 --> 27:45.620
and possibly oral anxiety,

27:45.621 --> 27:50.125
but I am not ready to leave the battlefield

27:50.126 --> 27:55.013
because I am no lion in his winter.

27:55.014 --> 27:58.717
I am an eagle in the spring.

27:58.718 --> 28:01.386
Yes, a bald eagle if you like.

28:01.387 --> 28:04.689
And so I ask you, the American people,

28:04.690 --> 28:07.025
to forgive me.

28:07.026 --> 28:09.861
And to allow me to keep fighting for you

28:09.862 --> 28:14.065
and to wield the most
powerful weapon there is.

28:14.066 --> 28:15.616
The truth.

28:16.986 --> 28:19.204
Oh, my God!

28:21.657 --> 28:23.575
Out the way.

28:23.576 --> 28:27.045
Major. Major.

28:27.046 --> 28:28.662
Major?

28:30.716 --> 28:33.418
Don't leave me!
