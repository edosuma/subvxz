WEBVTT

00:24.816 --> 00:26.485
Another day slips away

00:26.568 --> 00:30.280
-And you're fading
-Beyond us now

00:31.156 --> 00:35.577
You never were one
To stay where you belong

00:35.661 --> 00:38.038
They say love takes time

00:38.121 --> 00:41.333
But why'd you waste mine, baby?

00:41.416 --> 00:43.293
Be honest now

00:43.377 --> 00:46.839
You've been gone for so long

00:47.589 --> 00:51.468
-So, so long
-So long

01:01.270 --> 01:02.479
Thank you.

01:25.836 --> 01:27.045
-We're here.
-Yeah.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.715
-We're doing it.
-We're doing it.

01:35.345 --> 01:36.847
Hey, guys. You sound amazing.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.141
-I have a couple things I wanna run--
-Thank you.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.226
Can we talk about it after the show?

01:41.310 --> 01:43.228
-Oh, my God. Of course.
-Thanks.

01:44.897 --> 01:46.231
Wow.

01:49.401 --> 01:51.028
Let's change up the encore.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.572
Really. I think we should do it.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.575
Yeah. We can't really do that.

01:57.993 --> 02:01.205
-Don't you wanna play something else?
-I mean, sure…

02:01.288 --> 02:03.999
-Yes, you do. Look at you. No.
-…you know what we have to play.

02:05.334 --> 02:06.335
No.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.923
If you could play any song right now,
what would you play?

02:11.006 --> 02:12.424
What would you play?

02:14.676 --> 02:15.677
"High Low."

02:17.012 --> 02:19.681
That could be cool. It could be cool.

02:19.765 --> 02:22.059
Oh, my God. Wait. I have the best idea.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.644
Let's play "Quote Me."

02:24.728 --> 02:26.396
That would be perfect right now.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.107
Yeah?

02:29.191 --> 02:31.026
-Will you tell Greg and Lia?
-Sure.

02:32.361 --> 02:33.362
I love you.

02:49.086 --> 02:50.796
Los Angeles.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.093
I fucking love this city.

02:57.636 --> 03:00.597
You know, Josh,
he was born and raised here.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.683
-What's up, 818?
-Yeah!

03:02.766 --> 03:03.976
I heard you.

03:05.727 --> 03:10.607
Okay. So, before we do
this last song for you guys,

03:10.691 --> 03:12.651
I just wanna tell you

03:12.734 --> 03:15.195
how grateful we are
that you're all here tonight.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.155
It's kind of a miracle

03:17.239 --> 03:20.492
that any of us are here right now,
right here in this room.

03:21.827 --> 03:24.913
Think about all the little things
that had to happen to get you here,

03:26.290 --> 03:30.043
starting a lifetime ago
when your parents decided to make you.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.838
And somehow you ended up in LA.

03:33.380 --> 03:37.384
Maybe you chose to be here, like me,
or you were born here, like Josh.

03:39.428 --> 03:42.598
And then recently,
you heard about this show.

03:42.681 --> 03:45.893
And you decided to come.
And now here you are.

03:46.977 --> 03:49.313
And there were a million steps

03:49.396 --> 03:51.440
that could have gone differently
along the way.

03:51.523 --> 03:54.526
Either because you made a different choice

03:54.610 --> 03:57.654
or some other reason
that was totally out of your control.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.534
You could be somewhere else right now.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.871
You could be someone else.

04:07.581 --> 04:08.415
You ready?

04:12.294 --> 04:13.504
But you're not.

04:14.338 --> 04:15.631
You're you.

04:16.173 --> 04:20.677
And you're here, with us, right now.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.181
And we love you for that.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.141
We love you too!

04:28.936 --> 04:30.437
This song is called "Quote Me."

04:31.480 --> 04:33.565
One, two, three, four.

05:22.072 --> 05:23.407
"Judith."

05:24.700 --> 05:26.285
-Hello?
-Hi. Is this Judith?

05:26.368 --> 05:27.828
-Yeah.
-Hi, Judith. This is Josh.

05:27.911 --> 05:29.246
-How are you today?
-Fine.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.499
Judith, can I ask you a question?
Do you ever think about saving money?

05:33.375 --> 05:36.587
So, this one gets really good reviews.

05:37.212 --> 05:40.048
You know, you can pay people
to write good reviews online.

05:40.132 --> 05:43.051
That's true, but I'm reading these.
They seem pretty legit.

05:43.760 --> 05:47.014
-I don't know how you think you know that.
-'Cause I'm reading them.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.016
I know. I can see you're reading them.

05:49.725 --> 05:51.101
Okay, how do you wanna decide?

05:51.894 --> 05:53.437
Okay, so now it's on me?

05:53.937 --> 05:55.856
I don't know what you want me to do.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.567
I want you to be a grown-up
and make a decision.

05:58.650 --> 06:00.485
Okay. How about this one?

06:01.028 --> 06:03.071
-It's the same fucking one.
-Yep.

06:03.155 --> 06:05.032
Oh, my God. Josh, you're so annoying.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.075
Just go find Sophie. She's the giraffe.

06:20.923 --> 06:22.925
We had no choice.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.719
We had nothing to eat.

06:25.802 --> 06:28.305
Did you feel your life
was in danger?

06:29.014 --> 06:34.144
We didn't eat for days.
We were going to die.

06:34.228 --> 06:37.272
-We were dying.
-I know, and I'm so sorry

06:37.356 --> 06:39.399
you went through that.

06:39.483 --> 06:43.654
But to give you any opportunity for
asylum in the United States,

06:43.737 --> 06:46.740
I need to prove you
feared persecution.

06:47.991 --> 06:52.079
If not, I can help you get a work
permit here in Colombia.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.917
Okay?

06:59.753 --> 07:03.841
So, did you feel your life
was in danger?

07:05.300 --> 07:06.885
-Yes.
-Yes. Good.

07:11.056 --> 07:12.099
Thank you so much.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.433
-Sorry, what was your name?
-Astrid.

07:13.517 --> 07:17.855
Astrid. You wanna know how much money
this incredibly talented team just made

07:17.938 --> 07:19.147
for our company, Astrid?

07:19.231 --> 07:20.440
It's a pretty high number.

07:20.524 --> 07:22.109
-Do you wanna know what it is?
-Whoa. Okay.

07:22.192 --> 07:23.569
Come on. It's fun to say out loud.

07:23.652 --> 07:25.404
What was the final number?
Seventy-six what?

07:25.487 --> 07:26.738
Seventy-six, four five.

07:26.822 --> 07:31.660
$76,450,000.
Come on! That's a lot of houses.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.078
Astrid, aren't you happy

07:33.161 --> 07:35.914
for these hardworking
and successful people?

07:35.998 --> 07:38.333
I'm very happy for you all.
Congratulations.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.711
That was so sweet. Thank you, Astrid.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.754
-Cheers, everyone.
-Cheers!

07:43.589 --> 07:44.590
Yeah.

07:47.676 --> 07:50.304
Peter, what was
your favorite part of the experience? Go.

07:50.804 --> 07:54.266
Me, I just can't help but think about
what happened back in August.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.185
I'm sure you know what I'm referring to.

07:56.268 --> 07:57.436
-Absolutely.
-Oh, God.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.188
The whole deal almost fell apart.

07:59.271 --> 08:02.024
It would've fallen apart if Wilson hadn't
come in at the last minute

08:02.107 --> 08:04.067
and saved our you-know-whats.

08:05.694 --> 08:07.946
-I guess sometimes you get lucky.
-Hear, hear.

08:09.072 --> 08:13.285
-But, man, what a roller coaster though.
-Sorry, man, but wait, hold on.

08:13.368 --> 08:16.246
-You can't sell yourself short like that.
-I'm sorry?

08:16.330 --> 08:18.081
You chalked up this big victory to luck.

08:18.165 --> 08:21.168
You said it wouldn't have happened
except we got lucky. That's not fair.

08:21.251 --> 08:22.503
I was just saying--

08:22.586 --> 08:25.839
You might not have meant that,
but words matter, so let's be clear.

08:25.923 --> 08:29.301
The four of us are not drinking champagne
right now because we got lucky, right?

08:29.384 --> 08:32.971
We've been working our asses off
on nothing but this deal for two years.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.640
Peter, I know how hard you worked. I mean…

08:35.724 --> 08:39.227
This deal was never gonna fall apart,
'cause we weren't gonna let it fall apart.

08:39.311 --> 08:41.480
Did we hit a rough patch in August?
Yeah, we did.

08:41.563 --> 08:43.899
And did Wilson provide a solution?
Yeah, they did.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.818
But if they hadn't,
we would've figured something else out,

08:46.902 --> 08:48.278
'cause we were playing to win.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.446
Thank you, Astrid.

08:49.530 --> 08:53.575
You wanna know who talks about luck?
It's gamblers and losers.

08:53.659 --> 08:56.703
I'm sorry, I know that sounds kinda harsh,
but it's true.

08:56.787 --> 09:00.082
If you hear someone talking about,
"My deal fell apart. I had such bad luck,"

09:00.165 --> 09:01.458
the person's a loser.

09:01.542 --> 09:04.545
And the four of us,
we are clearly not losers.

09:04.628 --> 09:08.048
And we have 76 million new friends
in our bank account to prove it.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.008
You guys should be proud of yourselves!

09:10.092 --> 09:13.220
I don't want you going home tonight
feeling like, "Oh, we got lucky."

09:13.303 --> 09:16.181
I want you going home tonight
feeling that beautiful feeling

09:16.265 --> 09:18.392
that really only comes from winning.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.352
And I want you knowing
with full confidence,

09:20.435 --> 09:22.187
without any doubt in your mind,

09:22.271 --> 09:24.815
we won today 'cause we deserved it.

09:32.739 --> 09:33.740
I'll drink to that.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.467
-Hi, Astrid.
-How you doing there?

09:53.218 --> 09:54.386
Best day of my life.

09:54.887 --> 09:56.305
You've had quite a bit to drink.

09:58.182 --> 10:01.727
Yeah, well, you know,
it's a question of personal tolerance.

10:01.810 --> 10:02.811
Mine's pretty high.

10:02.895 --> 10:07.316
But I wanted to buy a round
for everyone in here.

10:09.026 --> 10:12.613
No, 'cause, listen,
this is a special moment for me.

10:12.696 --> 10:17.659
Like, my life changed today
'cause I'm rich now.

10:17.743 --> 10:19.077
Like, starting today.

10:19.161 --> 10:21.747
I'm fucking rich.
I wasn't born rich, and now I am.

10:21.830 --> 10:24.499
And so all these people here tonight
are dear to me,

10:24.583 --> 10:27.252
because they were the ones with me
when it happened.

10:27.336 --> 10:30.088
So I just wanna buy 'em all a drink.

10:31.882 --> 10:34.843
That's very generous,
but there's a lot of people here.

10:34.927 --> 10:36.053
I know you can't see them all.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.014
Oh, yeah, no. No, that's the point.
I want the bill to be high.

10:39.097 --> 10:43.352
I wanna see a ridiculous bill
and pay it and not care.

10:44.520 --> 10:48.565
That is the experience
that I'm looking to have right now.

10:48.649 --> 10:51.193
Can you-- Can you help me?

10:52.694 --> 10:54.404
What do you wanna buy for them?

10:55.906 --> 10:57.241
Don Julio.

10:59.076 --> 11:02.579
All right, I'm gonna go count everyone up.
You sure you want one for everybody?

11:02.663 --> 11:04.998
One for every blessed soul
in this entire establishment.

11:05.707 --> 11:06.542
You're funny.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.836
Hey, wait.
Just one other thing I wanted to ask.

11:08.919 --> 11:10.796
-Yeah?
-What are you doing tomorrow?

11:11.505 --> 11:14.258
Because I'm gonna fly away
to a beach somewhere,

11:14.341 --> 11:16.343
and I think you should come with me.

11:16.927 --> 11:20.138
-Let me get everyone's Don Julio.
-Oh, no. I'm serious about this.

11:20.222 --> 11:21.223
I have a boyfriend.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.935
And how much does he make in a year?

11:25.561 --> 11:27.187
-Sir--
-No. How much does he make?

11:28.355 --> 11:31.567
I think you've had a bit too much tonight.
You be safe getting home.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.443
Don't turn your fucking back on me!

11:33.527 --> 11:35.654
-Hey! I said how much does he make?
-Sir.

11:35.737 --> 11:36.947
How much does he make?

11:37.030 --> 11:38.323
-How much does he make?
-Sir!

11:38.407 --> 11:41.118
Get the fuck off!
I said get the fuck off me!

11:41.201 --> 11:43.245
How much does he make, you fucking bitch?

13:22.344 --> 13:23.512
Josh, slow down.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.014
I just don't wanna be late.

13:26.098 --> 13:27.432
We're not late.

13:30.561 --> 13:32.104
You're always rushing to get places,

13:32.187 --> 13:35.148
and then you always wanna leave
as soon as you're there.

13:36.525 --> 13:39.027
Okay, but that's not just me.
That's everybody.

13:39.111 --> 13:40.571
It's a little bit more you.

13:44.283 --> 13:47.244
-Just got a limited window today, so…
-I know. I know, I know.

13:51.373 --> 13:52.666
Did you tell her to be ready?

13:53.250 --> 13:57.129
She's meeting us out front,
but guess she had a hard morning, so…

13:57.212 --> 13:58.422
I'm sure she did.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.383
Come on. She's…

14:01.466 --> 14:04.636
You know, she's had it pretty tough.

14:05.137 --> 14:06.805
-Maybe.
-May--

14:08.849 --> 14:10.184
What do you mean "maybe"?

14:11.393 --> 14:14.897
I don't know. I mean, I know she has.

14:14.980 --> 14:17.608
It just--
It seems that's her excuse for everything.

14:19.109 --> 14:22.279
That she's got it so bad
and you've got it so good.

14:22.362 --> 14:25.199
Yeah. But, I mean, I do have it so good.

14:26.617 --> 14:27.618
I got you.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.455
Got that boy back there.

14:33.165 --> 14:35.417
And he has those legs.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.295
Look at them. They're so fat.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.047
He's a good, fat baby.

14:42.674 --> 14:44.384
And he is safe.

14:44.468 --> 14:46.094
Which is why I want you to slow down.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.597
Okay. Slowing down.

14:49.932 --> 14:52.893
Just so you know, it's not 'cause
you told me to, it's 'cause we're here.

14:54.436 --> 14:57.272
-I thought she was meeting us out front.
-Yeah.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.486
-I know. I'm sorry.
-Hi.

15:02.569 --> 15:05.197
Hi. I don't have any clean clothes.

15:05.280 --> 15:09.910
It's just, like, the lady that lives
across the way in Apartment 44,

15:09.993 --> 15:11.745
she leaves her shit in the dryer.

15:11.828 --> 15:14.081
Two hours ago I told her
that I needed to use it,

15:14.164 --> 15:16.834
and she was like,
"Take my stuff out. Put it on the dryer."

15:16.917 --> 15:18.752
I was like,
"Bitch, I'm not gonna do your laundry."

15:18.836 --> 15:21.839
-So that's where I am.
-Yeah. That's ridiculous.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.757
-Yeah.
-Wanna go in what you're wearing?

15:23.841 --> 15:26.176
-I can't go in what I'm wearing.
-I think you can.

15:26.260 --> 15:27.719
Why do you always contradict me?

15:27.803 --> 15:31.306
I'm sorry that I contradicted you.
It's just the timing on this is critical.

15:31.390 --> 15:34.226
Okay, dude. Dude, don't talk to me
in that even-keeled voice.

15:34.309 --> 15:35.769
Like you're so reasonable

15:35.853 --> 15:37.145
-and I'm out of line?
-Beth--

15:37.229 --> 15:39.106
-I get you're someone's daddy now--
-Hey!

15:40.399 --> 15:43.193
Either you come, or I do this by myself.
Which do you want?

15:44.945 --> 15:45.988
That was good.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.867
Yeah. Let's go.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.327
Does that work on your wife?

16:06.216 --> 16:08.760
I have a sick feeling in my stomach.
I don't wanna do this.

16:08.844 --> 16:10.053
Well, we're doing it.

16:11.346 --> 16:12.347
Okay.

16:14.308 --> 16:16.894
Oh, my God. She is so depressing.

16:16.977 --> 16:19.479
-No, she's not.
-Yes, she is. She's very depressing.

16:19.563 --> 16:21.398
Josh, she's depressing.

16:22.774 --> 16:23.775
Hi, Mom.

16:26.111 --> 16:30.073
-What is this? Wh-- Why are you all here?
-I told you we were gonna come by.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.576
I know.
But what's everybody else doing here?

16:32.659 --> 16:33.785
Is Jacob okay?

16:33.869 --> 16:36.538
Yeah, Jacob's fine. See?

16:37.664 --> 16:38.874
Can we come in?

16:39.541 --> 16:42.294
-Why?
-Mom, just let us come in.

16:43.921 --> 16:45.631
We wanna have a conversation with you…

16:46.548 --> 16:49.051
because we're worried about you.

16:50.260 --> 16:52.262
And we have been for some time.

16:54.097 --> 16:57.726
And we think that you need to leave Dad.

17:02.147 --> 17:05.526
-What is this? An intervention?
-Don't-- You know--

17:05.608 --> 17:08.403
You're doing an intervention
in front of a baby?

17:08.487 --> 17:10.821
-Mom, what does he care?
-I care!

17:10.906 --> 17:12.699
I don't want my grandson hearing this.

17:12.782 --> 17:14.201
Okay. Okay.

17:14.284 --> 17:18.579
I'm so sorry to interrupt,
but my milk just started.

17:18.664 --> 17:20.624
-Okay. That's great.
-Jesus, that's so crazy!

17:20.707 --> 17:23.877
Wh-- Can you please?
It's not crazy. It's beautiful.

17:23.961 --> 17:25.170
She's leaking.

17:25.253 --> 17:27.673
That is very sweet, babe,
but can you get me a paper towel?

17:27.756 --> 17:29.216
-Yeah.
-We're out.

17:29.299 --> 17:30.467
Seriously?

17:30.551 --> 17:31.760
Yes. What--

17:35.305 --> 17:37.057
Here, I have a napkin.

17:37.933 --> 17:39.184
Are you comfortable there?

17:39.268 --> 17:40.894
-We're great. Thank you.
-Good.

17:42.938 --> 17:45.232
Okay, so now I guess
I have to leave your father

17:45.315 --> 17:47.442
because we don't have
paper towels in the house.

17:47.526 --> 17:48.527
Kind of.

17:48.610 --> 17:51.488
I'm done. I've heard enough.
You've said what you need to say.

17:51.572 --> 17:53.991
No, there is a lot more for us to say.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.952
I am not leaving your father, all right?

17:57.035 --> 17:59.037
So when Jacob's finished,
you should leave,

17:59.121 --> 18:01.164
because he's gonna be home any minute.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.208
No, he's not. We timed this out.

18:03.292 --> 18:05.627
He's at Barone's right now
with Hal and Dot.

18:05.711 --> 18:07.212
He's watching Jeopardy!

18:07.963 --> 18:10.090
And we got a lot of time
until Final Jeopardy.

18:15.596 --> 18:16.805
Okay, that's true.

18:23.395 --> 18:25.564
If I left Artie now, he'd die.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.608
Mom, you don't know that.

18:27.691 --> 18:28.734
Yes, I do.

18:28.817 --> 18:31.236
Okay, but it's not really about him.
It's about you.

18:31.320 --> 18:33.614
You don't have any friends left
because of him.

18:33.697 --> 18:36.658
You don't have any money left
because of him.

18:36.742 --> 18:37.951
All you have is him.

18:38.619 --> 18:41.914
-Yeah, and all he has is me. He needs me.
-But what about what you need?

18:41.997 --> 18:44.374
How dare you two come and do this.

18:44.958 --> 18:48.921
I stayed in this shitty life for you two
because I thought it was best for you.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.924
Look-- Look at you. Look where you are.

18:52.007 --> 18:54.301
You're an amazing professor.
About to get tenure.

18:54.384 --> 18:57.679
You're married to a wonderful woman.
You have a healthy child.

18:57.763 --> 19:00.557
You think that would have happened
if you were from a broken home?

19:00.641 --> 19:01.725
What about me, Mom?

19:03.727 --> 19:05.103
I don't have any of that shit.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.980
Yeah, well, you're a different story.

19:08.023 --> 19:09.483
Okay, great.

19:09.566 --> 19:13.654
I mean, I didn't feel
that stable either growing up.

19:14.488 --> 19:15.864
Living with Dad was scary.

19:15.948 --> 19:19.493
Well, it would've been worse
if I was a single mother.

19:20.035 --> 19:24.414
I mean, both of your lives
would've been totally different.

19:25.249 --> 19:27.292
It could've been--

19:27.376 --> 19:30.045
It-- It could've sucked!

19:30.128 --> 19:31.129
I have to pee.

19:31.964 --> 19:32.965
No, can--

19:35.175 --> 19:37.678
She always has to pee
when she doesn't like a situation.

19:37.761 --> 19:38.887
I know.

19:39.805 --> 19:43.308
Mom, are you gonna come out?

19:43.392 --> 19:45.018
I'm going to the bathroom.

19:45.102 --> 19:47.855
Yeah, but it's been a long time now.

19:49.106 --> 19:51.650
It turns out I had more to do.

19:51.733 --> 19:54.444
She literally locked herself
in the bathroom.

19:54.528 --> 19:57.489
Of course I locked the door.
I'm going to the bathroom.

19:57.573 --> 20:00.200
But I didn't lock myself in the bathroom.

20:00.284 --> 20:01.285
What time is it?

20:01.869 --> 20:03.704
-Getting late.
-Fuck.

20:03.787 --> 20:07.624
I'm certainly never gonna finish
if you two stay outside the door.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.544
How long's she been in there?

20:11.587 --> 20:13.213
Twenty-one minutes.

20:13.297 --> 20:15.507
-How much longer till Final Jeopardy?
-It's already over.

20:15.591 --> 20:17.092
Fucking waited us out.

20:18.010 --> 20:19.011
I'm here.

20:23.265 --> 20:27.269
I want you both to know
I appreciate what you're trying to do.

20:27.352 --> 20:29.688
-It's 'cause we love you, Mom.
-I know.

20:34.818 --> 20:36.069
What are you gonna tell him?

20:36.820 --> 20:38.697
No, what are you gonna tell him?

20:40.532 --> 20:43.202
Darling, listen to me. I'm safe, okay?

20:43.285 --> 20:46.914
We have food here. We have a generator.
I can stay here as long as I need to.

20:48.916 --> 20:49.917
Yeah.

20:51.585 --> 20:54.463
Yeah, I'm not sure, but I'll let you know
as soon as I hear more.

20:55.506 --> 20:58.091
Yes, trust me. I am safe.

21:01.011 --> 21:02.221
Yeah, I know.

21:04.223 --> 21:06.016
Most people in this town aren't so lucky.

21:09.603 --> 21:10.604
Love you too.

21:15.859 --> 21:21.573
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

21:22.574 --> 21:23.575
How I--

21:24.952 --> 21:26.370
Get away from my baby!

21:51.645 --> 21:53.188
Taco Tuesday.

22:12.749 --> 22:15.377
Hey! You made it.

22:16.044 --> 22:18.338
-Hey.
-I'm so happy to see you.

22:18.422 --> 22:20.632
-You too.
-Wanna dance?

22:21.633 --> 22:23.177
Thought you'd never ask.

23:49.763 --> 23:51.390
Hey. Hi.

23:54.351 --> 23:55.352
I was--

23:55.435 --> 23:57.813
I knew he hit his head
and, you know, but I'm--

23:57.896 --> 23:59.648
He was fine. He seemed fine, you know.

23:59.731 --> 24:02.568
He-- He drove us home, no problem.

24:05.195 --> 24:06.822
I should have known, you know.

24:08.240 --> 24:11.326
I should ha-- I'm so sorry.
I should have known. He's my friend.

24:11.410 --> 24:14.162
It's not your fault.
You can't blame yourself.

24:14.246 --> 24:16.915
Right, it's just--
It's shitty fucking luck.

24:16.999 --> 24:21.128
I should have known. I'm so sorry. Sorry.

24:41.315 --> 24:46.153
You think he'd be mad
that we're drinking in his honor?

24:46.945 --> 24:48.197
No.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.990
No, actually, I don't think he would.

24:50.073 --> 24:53.243
-He never judged me for having a drink.
-Really? That's funny.

24:53.327 --> 24:56.663
He's the most judgmental person
I have ever known.

24:57.289 --> 24:59.166
Except for you, Mom. I'm sorry.

25:00.792 --> 25:04.004
Trust me, I know all about that.
He hated everything.

25:07.382 --> 25:11.512
When he-- When he quit our band
and started teaching,

25:11.595 --> 25:13.931
and I kept going with the music stuff…

25:15.015 --> 25:17.392
I always thought
he was judging me for that, you know?

25:19.686 --> 25:20.896
But when I look back,

25:20.979 --> 25:25.609
I think maybe he was kinda
just looking out for me, in his own way.

25:27.277 --> 25:28.529
He did that a lot.

25:29.821 --> 25:31.323
He worried about me.

25:35.577 --> 25:39.414
Maybe he just didn't want me
to make the wrong choice,

25:39.498 --> 25:42.292
then wake up one day feeling like
I was living the wrong life

25:42.376 --> 25:44.586
and wondering how I got there, you know?

25:45.420 --> 25:48.924
Most of the time we never even have
a choice. We just think we do.

25:49.508 --> 25:52.886
Yeah.
I guess that's why I'm still singing.

25:54.012 --> 25:56.431
Well, cheers to that.

25:56.515 --> 25:57.516
Hell yeah.

25:58.100 --> 26:00.060
I think you have a beautiful voice.

26:00.978 --> 26:02.563
-Really?
-Absolutely.

26:05.107 --> 26:06.316
Thanks, Ruthie.

26:06.400 --> 26:09.528
Honey. You don't have to thank me.
It's just true.

26:11.780 --> 26:15.784
Certainly better than
some of those bleep-bloop-bloppily noises

26:15.868 --> 26:18.579
-Joshua made out of his songs, right?
-What was that?

26:18.662 --> 26:20.747
The bloopy-- The bloopy things.

26:20.831 --> 26:23.876
-The bleepy-- What were they?
-I don't know.

26:40.559 --> 26:41.560
Okay.

27:20.265 --> 27:21.266
It's okay.

27:22.851 --> 27:25.687
It is ten after 8:00.
Everybody done with breakfast?

27:26.396 --> 27:28.941
You're still eating. Take your time.
Mind if we start though?

27:29.024 --> 27:30.192
-Nah. I'm good.
-Cool.

27:30.275 --> 27:33.153
Everybody else good?
Feeling it? I'm feeling it today.

27:33.237 --> 27:36.698
It's gonna be a good day.
We're gonna get a lot done. You ready?

28:02.224 --> 28:05.185
Another day slips away
And you're fading

28:05.269 --> 28:08.480
-Beyond
-Beyond us now

28:08.564 --> 28:12.943
You never were one
To stay where you belong

28:13.026 --> 28:15.445
They say love takes time

28:15.529 --> 28:17.990
But why'd you waste mine, baby?

28:18.073 --> 28:20.784
Be honest now

28:20.868 --> 28:24.997
You've been gone for so long

28:25.080 --> 28:29.793
-So, so long
-So long

28:29.877 --> 28:34.047
-And you're fading
-Beyond us now

28:34.131 --> 28:38.552
You never were one
To stay where you belong

28:38.635 --> 28:41.054
They say love takes time

28:41.138 --> 28:43.473
But why'd you waste mine?

28:43.557 --> 28:46.393
-Be honest, be honest
-Be honest now

28:46.476 --> 28:50.480
You've been gone for so long

28:50.564 --> 28:55.110
-So, so long
-So long
