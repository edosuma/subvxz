WEBVTT

01:44.737 --> 01:46.004
How are you?

01:46.006 --> 01:49.041
Yeah, I'm okay, how are you?

02:05.458 --> 02:08.759
You're making fun
of my accent.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.027
I'm not!

03:53.566 --> 03:55.067
<i> We interrupt</i>
<i> tonight's programming</i>

03:55.069 --> 04:00.105
<i>to report a massive power outage</i>
<i> up and down the west coast.</i>

04:00.107 --> 04:01.707
<i> What is a fugue state?</i>

04:01.709 --> 04:06.078
<i> It's like a kind of amnesia</i>
<i> that lasts a long time.</i>

04:06.080 --> 04:07.846
<i> A fugue state:</i>

04:07.848 --> 04:10.782
<i> When amnesia continues for</i>
<i> an extended period of time,</i>

04:10.784 --> 04:13.852
<i> the amnesiac occasionally</i>
<i> begins a new life</i>

04:13.854 --> 04:17.689
<i> entirely unrelated to</i>
<i> his previous condition.</i>

04:17.690 --> 04:20.791
<i> This response is called</i>
<i> a fugue state.</i>

04:25.565 --> 04:26.632
Eli.

04:39.812 --> 04:41.713
Why don't I have a signal?

04:41.715 --> 04:42.714
<i> Music on!</i>

04:42.716 --> 04:44.483
<i> Power on!</i>

04:44.485 --> 04:45.617
Dad?

04:45.619 --> 04:47.853
<i> Power on!</i>

04:47.855 --> 04:48.887
What about the solar?

04:48.889 --> 04:48.887
<i> Dad?</i>

04:48.889 --> 04:51.056
When does that inverter
come in?

04:51.058 --> 04:51.056
Four weeks ago.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.892
I'll ask again next time
I'm in town.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.227
My sat's are on Thursday!

04:55.229 --> 04:56.561
I need to study.

04:56.563 --> 05:00.232
Ah, there is an ancient
technology,

05:00.234 --> 05:01.733
you may have heard of it.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.535
It's called "books".

05:03.537 --> 05:05.203
Stuff changes every day.

05:07.907 --> 05:10.242
Let's light some candles,
sweet pea.

05:10.244 --> 05:11.910
I'm just right in the middle.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.845
Can we throw some gas
in the generator?

05:13.847 --> 05:15.180
Yeah, dad.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.581
Eva needs her music.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.650
We can't deprive her
of her dancing.

05:18.652 --> 05:18.650
Okay, there's no water, either.

05:18.652 --> 05:21.920
When are you girls going to
get used to living up here?

05:21.922 --> 05:24.222
When you finish fixing
the house.

05:49.549 --> 05:50.949
Lights on.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.295
Come on, captain consumers.

06:37.297 --> 06:40.732
Time to hunt and gather
some fossil fuels.

06:45.204 --> 06:47.272
Oh, shit!

06:47.274 --> 06:49.941
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

06:49.943 --> 06:51.676
I'm so sorry...

06:51.678 --> 06:53.078
I came out to get
the head lamp

06:53.080 --> 06:57.582
and I must have left it open.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.950
It's alright.

07:01.088 --> 07:01.887
I'm such a dink.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.855
I'm so sorry!

07:03.857 --> 07:06.358
It's okay,
i got another battery.

07:18.337 --> 07:20.238
Okay, turn it over.

07:25.846 --> 07:25.844
No.

07:25.846 --> 07:28.647
<i> We think it happened</i>
<i> at the power plant</i>

07:28.649 --> 07:29.915
<i> where there was a problem.</i>

07:29.917 --> 07:32.150
<i> The emergency systems took</i>
<i> over and essentially</i>

07:32.152 --> 07:34.352
<i> shut the plant down.</i>

07:34.354 --> 07:38.223
<i> That then triggered shut-downs</i>
<i> across the power grid,</i>

07:38.225 --> 07:40.826
<i> and we are hearing</i>
<i> that that grid didn't have</i>

07:40.828 --> 07:42.794
<i> the capacity to deal with</i>
<i> that problem,</i>

07:42.796 --> 07:44.196
<i> so it shut itself down</i>

07:44.198 --> 07:46.231
<i> and that was sort of</i>
<i> the link being broken.</i>

07:46.233 --> 07:48.934
<i> We still are waiting to hear</i>
<i> from officials to find out</i>

07:48.936 --> 07:53.238
<i> what was the exact cause...</i>

07:53.240 --> 07:55.340
<i> There are many rumors,</i>
<i> some suggest a terrorist</i>

07:55.342 --> 08:00.712
<i> targeting our</i>
<i> power supply...</i>

08:00.714 --> 08:03.381
<i> It seems</i>
<i> at least 300 million people</i>

08:03.383 --> 08:04.983
<i> are now without power.</i>

08:04.985 --> 08:08.753
<i> Back up generators...</i>
<i> No word yet...</i>

08:08.755 --> 08:10.856
<i> Millions are still</i>
<i> without power.</i>

08:10.858 --> 08:13.258
<i> No subways, elevators,</i>
<i> airports...</i>

08:13.260 --> 08:16.294
<i> So if vaccine</i>
<i> refrigeration is of</i>
<i> particular concern</i>

08:16.296 --> 08:19.831
<i> in the capital...</i>

08:19.833 --> 08:21.433
<i>... has asked</i>
<i> everyone to stay home.</i>

08:21.435 --> 08:25.770
<i> Boil your water and</i>
<i> conserve your food...</i>

08:25.772 --> 08:27.372
Should we just walk?

08:27.374 --> 08:29.274
It would take you three days,
pumpkin.

08:29.276 --> 08:32.210
And how would we carry
the gas back?

08:32.212 --> 08:34.446
Maybe someone
will pick us up.

08:34.448 --> 08:37.883
And if they don't,
or they won't?

08:37.885 --> 08:39.116
We'll stay in town.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.085
Finally.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.320
And pay for a hotel with what,
exactly?

08:42.322 --> 08:45.190
We can just sell Eva.

08:45.192 --> 08:48.727
That'll get you a can of spam.

08:48.729 --> 08:50.128
What is spam, exactly?

08:50.130 --> 08:51.096
Mind this.

08:51.098 --> 08:52.964
There is actually a spam museum.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.467
The guggenheim.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.236
One, dad.

09:18.057 --> 09:21.026
Dad?

09:21.028 --> 09:22.894
Eva?

09:22.896 --> 09:24.262
<i> What's up?</i>

09:24.264 --> 09:26.498
There's nothing.

09:29.769 --> 09:30.735
Is the volume on?

09:30.737 --> 09:33.338
Yeah.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.940
What about the battery?

09:34.942 --> 09:36.908
It's solar.

09:52.525 --> 09:56.962
You're gonna pass with flying
colors, pumpkin.

09:56.964 --> 09:59.297
You have to say that
because you're my father.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.899
True.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.934
But I'm also right.

10:02.936 --> 10:09.140
You could be president of
the entire universe.

10:09.142 --> 10:12.510
I just want to know that
i could have got in.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.212
I know.

10:30.062 --> 10:32.197
What?

10:32.199 --> 10:33.365
Lightbulb.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.641
Okay, give me your shoelaces.

10:42.643 --> 10:43.375
Really?

10:43.542 --> 10:46.111
Really.

10:46.113 --> 10:47.212
Okay.

10:50.850 --> 10:51.616
Careful, dad.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.358
Oh my god!

11:24.617 --> 11:24.616
Wow.

11:24.618 --> 11:27.218
The Johnson's left their home.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.920
That's weird.

11:32.358 --> 11:36.161
So, uh... are you
gonna see your...

11:36.163 --> 11:38.263
Friends again?

11:38.265 --> 11:40.131
Yeah, we'll see who's there.

12:05.925 --> 12:07.258
Woah.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.526
So fast.

12:09.563 --> 12:12.063
Sorry I gotta ask you this...

12:12.065 --> 12:15.266
You got money, yeah?

12:15.268 --> 12:18.069
Yes sir, I do, sir.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.538
And your big box membership
card is all paid up to date?

12:22.342 --> 12:22.340
Of course.

12:22.342 --> 12:25.009
I mean, who could refuse
the opportunity to pay

12:25.011 --> 12:27.479
for the right to shop.

12:27.481 --> 12:29.414
Yeah.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.949
Well, we can't be
too careful.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.417
A crisis like this doesn't
always bring out

12:32.419 --> 12:33.685
the best side of people.

12:33.687 --> 12:35.520
It reveals character,
you're right there.

12:35.522 --> 12:36.621
Yes, it reveals character.

12:36.623 --> 12:36.621
I tell you, you know?

12:36.623 --> 12:36.621
It's people wanting
something for nothing

12:36.623 --> 12:40.458
is what got us into this mess
in the first place.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.093
I'm with you there, Stan.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.229
Um, any gas in town?

12:44.231 --> 12:46.431
No.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.000
Old Mick is expecting a
shipment any day now,

12:49.002 --> 12:51.069
but uh... he likes to talk.

12:51.071 --> 12:54.506
Yeah, he does like to talk.

12:54.508 --> 12:57.308
Anyone else selling?

12:57.310 --> 12:59.644
Why don't you come around
back when you're done here?

12:59.646 --> 13:00.445
Thank you.

13:00.447 --> 13:00.445
Yeah.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.982
Dad, the inverter for
the solar panels?

13:03.984 --> 13:04.716
Uh, our shipment come in?

13:04.718 --> 13:05.717
Nope.

13:05.719 --> 13:08.052
No gas, no shipments.

13:08.054 --> 13:09.754
No gas, no shipments.

13:11.423 --> 13:12.290
Salt.

13:22.701 --> 13:25.270
Got it.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.439
Hey.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.475
Wow.

13:30.477 --> 13:31.309
Thanks, Stan.

13:31.311 --> 13:31.309
How much?

13:31.311 --> 13:37.415
Ah... say 50 for the gas and
the candles are on the house.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.283
Thanks!

13:38.285 --> 13:39.417
No problem.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.319
All gotta take care of
each other, right?

13:41.321 --> 13:43.388
That's right.

13:43.390 --> 13:46.124
So you guys leaving town or
are you gonna stick around?

13:46.126 --> 13:47.759
Nah, just head home.

13:47.761 --> 13:48.626
Wait it out.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.295
Oh, so you can save on gas.

13:50.297 --> 13:51.596
Yeah.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.565
Yep, yep, yep.

14:06.378 --> 14:08.079
<i> Yo Robbie, check this out.</i>

14:08.081 --> 14:10.582
<i> Mmm, tasty.</i>

14:10.584 --> 14:12.450
<i> I know, right?</i>

14:32.805 --> 14:33.605
See you later.

14:33.607 --> 14:36.074
Yeah.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.342
Hey, Jerry.

14:37.344 --> 14:38.676
Hey, Robert.

14:38.678 --> 14:41.212
Okay, dad.
I'm gonna go now.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.248
I'll meet you back here
right at 11:00, deal?

14:43.250 --> 14:44.082
Deal.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.583
Say hi to what's his name.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.652
You don't know him so
I'm not gonna say hi.

14:47.654 --> 14:50.288
Okay, pumpkin.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.122
Hey, Nell!

14:51.124 --> 14:52.624
Yeah?

14:52.626 --> 14:54.792
Love you like stink.

14:54.794 --> 14:56.794
I love you like stink, too,
dad.

14:56.796 --> 14:58.396
Hey, Jerry.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.398
Let me buy you a warm beer.

15:00.400 --> 15:04.335
We need more energy in your
left arm as you go up and over.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.771
Okay, right from
the beginning.

15:06.773 --> 15:08.072
And more energy
in your left arm.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.774
And pull and release.

15:15.714 --> 15:16.814
...alright.

15:23.689 --> 15:25.823
Given that this is
the end of the world and all.

15:42.708 --> 15:46.210
It's a beautiful,
beautiful night!

15:46.212 --> 15:48.813
What are you doing?

15:48.815 --> 15:50.214
Isn't it?

15:50.216 --> 15:51.149
You're right.

15:54.421 --> 15:58.389
It's like there's beautiful,
beautiful, swirling waterfalls

15:58.391 --> 15:59.157
and I just...

15:59.159 --> 16:00.725
Oh, okay.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.360
Are you okay?

16:02.362 --> 16:04.262
Nothing wrong
with falling over.

16:04.264 --> 16:05.630
Alright, Nelly.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.297
I'll just get you up.

16:06.299 --> 16:07.732
Hey, Nell.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.801
When people fall down,
sometimes it's okay.

16:09.803 --> 16:10.468
No.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.602
Not that big of a deal.

16:11.604 --> 16:14.339
Alright.

16:14.341 --> 16:15.807
Is that your sister?

16:15.809 --> 16:17.542
Yeah.

16:27.453 --> 16:28.920
See you next week maybe.

16:28.922 --> 16:29.587
Of course.

16:29.589 --> 16:30.421
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

16:30.423 --> 16:31.589
Alright.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.157
-Bye.
-Bye.

16:38.530 --> 16:40.264
It was nice meeting you,
Nell's sister.

16:40.266 --> 16:41.699
You too.

16:47.373 --> 16:50.675
Uh, Nell's stubbed her toe.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.410
Yeah?

16:52.412 --> 16:54.712
And my face.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.280
Stubbed face.

16:56.282 --> 16:57.515
Ouch.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.521
We should start a band.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.557
A family band.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.993
That sounded good.

17:41.995 --> 17:43.895
How was dance?

17:43.897 --> 17:47.565
Uh...

17:47.567 --> 17:48.833
Ruby doesn't think
I'm going to be ready

17:48.835 --> 17:51.969
for the national auditions.

17:51.971 --> 17:51.969
Really?

17:51.971 --> 17:55.540
Yeah, I mean, she doesn't
say that exactly,

17:55.542 --> 17:58.276
but I can tell.

17:58.278 --> 17:59.444
I'm just never gonna get back
in the game.

17:59.446 --> 18:02.613
No. Come on, I mean,
you ruined your knee.

18:02.615 --> 18:03.748
That takes time.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.716
I know, but it's not-

18:05.718 --> 18:06.651
it's not my knee.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.954
I'm just ancient.

18:09.956 --> 18:12.557
So what does that make me?

18:12.559 --> 18:13.891
Super old.

18:20.466 --> 18:21.966
What have we here?

18:37.583 --> 18:38.816
You guys need a hand?

18:43.622 --> 18:44.856
Everything okay?

18:50.696 --> 18:51.896
Alright.

18:53.566 --> 18:54.932
I'll take that as a yes.

19:02.574 --> 19:04.442
Oh, girls.

19:43.815 --> 19:45.149
Lights on.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.101
How's your toe?

20:04.103 --> 20:05.570
And your face?

20:05.572 --> 20:07.104
Aside from totally wrecked.

20:07.106 --> 20:10.441
It's okay.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.677
This bread is stale
and totally gross.

20:20.485 --> 20:21.752
<i> 'Morning, sweet-pea.</i>

20:21.754 --> 20:23.487
<i> 'Morning.</i>

20:27.259 --> 20:29.660
Mmm. Powdered milk.

20:33.632 --> 20:36.901
So we're not going to be going
into town for a while.

20:36.903 --> 20:37.602
What?

20:37.604 --> 20:38.269
Why?

20:38.271 --> 20:41.072
Just for a while.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.574
We don't know when the
power's gonna come back on.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.544
We have water, wood,
plenty of food.

20:46.546 --> 20:47.778
We have to.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.513
We're safe here.

20:49.515 --> 20:50.781
Dad, we have to!

20:50.783 --> 20:51.983
No.

20:54.119 --> 20:57.455
Who says you get to be
the one to decide?

20:57.457 --> 20:59.156
I'm just gonna take
the car myself.

21:02.194 --> 21:03.628
I know she doesn't mean it.

21:03.630 --> 21:04.895
Yeah, I know.

21:11.803 --> 21:15.906
What do you think
this is?

21:15.908 --> 21:17.475
Peaches.

21:21.914 --> 21:24.148
Ugh, no!

21:24.150 --> 21:24.982
Woof.

21:24.984 --> 21:25.716
No!

21:25.718 --> 21:26.617
Woof, woof.

21:29.889 --> 21:29.887
So, what?

21:29.889 --> 21:33.557
We're just gonna hole up
here for the rest of our lives?

21:33.559 --> 21:35.760
No, we'll wait out the
power outage, pumpkin.

21:35.762 --> 21:37.495
I'm not your fucking
pumpkin!

21:37.497 --> 21:38.796
Woah, woah, woah,
woah, woah.

21:38.798 --> 21:42.466
No.

21:42.468 --> 21:43.834
Thanks, sweetie.

22:19.205 --> 22:20.237
Ahhhhhh!!!!!!!!!

22:20.239 --> 22:21.639
Dad?

22:24.710 --> 22:25.876
Dad!

22:28.980 --> 22:29.880
Dad!

22:38.623 --> 22:39.724
Dad!

22:44.863 --> 22:46.764
Oh, oh.

22:46.766 --> 22:49.100
Ah!

22:49.102 --> 22:49.800
Girls, girls, girls.

22:49.802 --> 22:50.668
I'm leaking, I'm leaking.

23:01.546 --> 23:02.680
Take care of each other.

23:02.682 --> 23:05.182
Shut up, dad!

23:05.184 --> 23:08.285
Dad, you're gonna be okay,
dad.

23:08.287 --> 23:09.653
You're gonna be fine.

23:12.825 --> 23:14.592
You're gonna be fine.

23:14.594 --> 23:17.695
You're gonna be fine.

23:17.697 --> 23:18.696
Love each other.

23:18.698 --> 23:19.897
You're gonna be fine.

23:23.636 --> 23:26.637
Hey, hey, hey.

23:26.639 --> 23:27.671
Dad!

23:29.142 --> 23:30.775
Dad!

23:58.870 --> 24:01.906
I think it's those wild pigs.

26:47.272 --> 26:51.375
Hey, Eva.

26:51.377 --> 26:54.511
There's um... eggs.

28:14.125 --> 28:16.627
I want to fill the generator.

28:16.629 --> 28:18.228
What?

28:18.230 --> 28:20.597
Let's fill the generator.

28:20.599 --> 28:24.268
Right now, before it gets
too dark and we spill some.

28:24.270 --> 28:25.402
Why?

28:29.074 --> 28:32.076
'Cause I want to see mom
and dad.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.944
We can watch home movies,

28:33.946 --> 28:36.580
and I could put music on
and dance.

28:42.020 --> 28:44.922
We can't.

28:44.924 --> 28:48.258
We have to save it
for the Jeep.

28:48.260 --> 28:49.493
There's, like, five gallons
in here.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.295
We only need two to get
to town.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.197
Yeah, and two to get back.

28:53.199 --> 28:54.131
Okay, so four.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.733
That leaves one for right now.

28:59.104 --> 29:00.337
I'm sorry. We...

29:00.339 --> 29:02.539
We have to save it
for an emergency.

29:02.541 --> 29:03.607
I need it.

29:03.609 --> 29:05.375
You don't need it.

29:05.377 --> 29:08.112
Come on, this is our
life insurance.

29:08.114 --> 29:09.546
Our life insurance.

29:09.548 --> 29:10.380
Yeah.

29:10.382 --> 29:11.648
Ours.

29:11.650 --> 29:13.450
Half mine.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.252
Of course it's half yours,
everything is half yours-

29:15.254 --> 29:16.053
okay, I'll just use my half.

29:16.055 --> 29:16.053
No!

29:16.055 --> 29:20.057
Because what's left over
won't do any good, okay?!

29:20.059 --> 29:23.093
No! We need to save it for
when we really need it!

29:26.698 --> 29:28.332
Stop.

29:28.334 --> 29:30.167
Stop.

29:37.510 --> 29:42.045
Eva?

30:13.611 --> 30:15.179
Eva?

30:22.053 --> 30:23.453
Eva!

30:25.657 --> 30:28.325
Eva, pinky and bisheba
are dead.

30:28.327 --> 30:29.760
Eva?

30:40.438 --> 30:42.039
Okay, well, I'm gonna
make lunch

30:42.041 --> 30:48.245
'cause I'm starving
and I'm sure you are too.

30:48.247 --> 30:51.548
So come in whenever
you want.

31:23.481 --> 31:24.615
Eva.

31:27.352 --> 31:28.552
Look, I understand.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.754
No you don't.

31:30.756 --> 31:33.423
Mom would have got it.

32:14.866 --> 32:16.900
Eva!

32:19.704 --> 32:21.305
Eva!

32:23.642 --> 32:29.346
Eva! Eva!!!!!!!

32:30.515 --> 32:34.751
Eva!!!!

32:40.558 --> 32:43.460
Hey, hey!

32:43.462 --> 32:44.594
Shhh.

32:44.596 --> 32:46.163
Hey!

32:46.165 --> 32:47.531
Are you okay?

32:47.533 --> 32:49.633
What's wrong?

32:49.635 --> 32:52.669
It's okay, it's okay.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.338
I'm here.

32:54.340 --> 32:57.441
Shhh, are you okay?

32:57.443 --> 33:03.580
I dreamed that the pigs
tied up dad.

33:03.582 --> 33:05.215
I could not find you.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.384
It's okay.

33:07.386 --> 33:09.353
I couldn't find you.

33:09.355 --> 33:11.588
I'm here.

33:11.590 --> 33:12.689
I couldn't find you.

33:12.691 --> 33:15.359
I'm right here, it's okay.

33:15.361 --> 33:16.593
I couldn't find you.

33:16.595 --> 33:18.695
Shhh...

33:18.697 --> 33:20.330
It's okay.

34:21.292 --> 34:27.297
Eva, Eva!!!

35:08.040 --> 35:09.005
You know what?

35:09.007 --> 35:10.607
I can't.

35:10.609 --> 35:11.808
I can't do this anymore.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.945
I can't keep dancing
to a metronome.

35:14.947 --> 35:18.448
And I know you think this is
all very precious of me.

35:18.450 --> 35:20.984
Just please, give me
ten minutes.

35:20.986 --> 35:23.320
Ten minutes.

35:23.322 --> 35:25.088
I can live off of that
for a while.

35:27.758 --> 35:30.327
Please.

35:30.329 --> 35:32.028
I got a surprise.

35:32.030 --> 35:37.400
It's not as good as the gas,

35:37.402 --> 35:40.904
but I know that you're
gonna like it.

35:45.810 --> 35:46.610
Oh, wow.

35:46.612 --> 35:47.777
Right?

35:47.779 --> 35:49.079
Two pieces of gum.

35:49.081 --> 35:50.881
You can have them both.

35:53.784 --> 35:55.519
What's this?

35:59.090 --> 36:03.760
Um... it was... a chocolate.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.595
Where is it?

36:08.032 --> 36:10.400
I ate it.

36:10.402 --> 36:13.803
So when I'm in there trying
to dance to a fucking metronome

36:13.805 --> 36:15.705
you're in here
eating chocolate?!

36:15.707 --> 36:17.474
You never ate chocolate!

36:17.476 --> 36:20.076
Oh my god, Nell!

36:20.078 --> 36:21.611
I- I called for you,

36:21.613 --> 36:23.580
you completely ignored me,

36:23.582 --> 36:25.649
I didn't think that you'd mind!

36:32.957 --> 36:34.624
Get dad's gun.

37:21.973 --> 37:24.574
Who is it?

37:24.576 --> 37:25.942
<i> Nell, is that you?</i>

37:30.748 --> 37:31.581
Oh my god.

37:31.583 --> 37:32.649
Eli?

37:35.853 --> 37:37.587
Hi.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.990
Nell.

37:39.992 --> 37:42.125
How did you get here?

37:42.127 --> 37:43.860
I started out on my bike
but I got a flat

37:43.862 --> 37:45.996
so I had to walk.

37:45.998 --> 37:49.432
It's taken a few days.

37:49.434 --> 37:50.500
I wasn't sure which house
you were in

37:50.502 --> 37:52.435
so I tried all of them.

37:52.437 --> 37:54.471
I knew you were out here
by yourselves.

37:54.473 --> 37:58.441
There's no one else
on the road.

37:58.443 --> 38:00.443
You okay?

38:00.445 --> 38:01.678
We're fine.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.546
Where's your dad?

38:03.548 --> 38:07.751
He died.

38:07.753 --> 38:09.786
It was an accident.

38:09.788 --> 38:12.188
I'm so sorry.

38:12.190 --> 38:13.556
Come in.

38:13.558 --> 38:15.025
Come on.

38:19.130 --> 38:20.163
You sure there's enough?

38:20.165 --> 38:21.798
Oh yeah, no, we ate.

38:21.800 --> 38:22.599
Thank you.

38:22.601 --> 38:26.202
Thank you, thank you.

38:26.204 --> 38:28.672
What's happening in town?

38:28.674 --> 38:30.840
People are getting sick.

38:30.842 --> 38:34.611
There's no water filtration.

38:34.613 --> 38:40.750
I thought you'd died when
you stopped coming to town.

38:40.752 --> 38:41.785
No.

38:41.787 --> 38:44.788
We ran out of gas.

38:44.790 --> 38:47.657
Everyone's run out of gas.

38:47.659 --> 38:48.992
There's no gas,
there's no electricity,

38:48.994 --> 38:53.196
there's no transportation,
there's no phones,

38:53.198 --> 38:57.233
there's no Internet.

38:57.235 --> 39:01.237
It's the wild fucking west
out there.

39:01.239 --> 39:05.075
Do they have any idea
what caused it all?

39:05.077 --> 39:06.676
There's rumors.

39:09.513 --> 39:14.284
There are theories,
like mad theories, but...

39:14.286 --> 39:16.986
You guys have your bikes?

39:16.988 --> 39:20.790
No, our dad gave them to some
kids at a school a while back.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.726
That's a shame.

39:31.802 --> 39:33.870
<i> Where are you taking me?</i>

39:33.872 --> 39:34.938
<i> What's up there?</i>

39:34.940 --> 39:35.872
<i> Forest.</i>

39:35.874 --> 39:36.940
<i> There's forest down here.</i>

39:36.942 --> 39:40.543
You'll see.

39:40.545 --> 39:41.745
I'm coming for you.

39:41.747 --> 39:43.146
I'm coming for you.
I'm coming for you!

39:43.148 --> 39:44.447
No, don't even think about it!

39:48.720 --> 39:49.652
Come here.

39:49.654 --> 39:50.920
Come here.

40:06.003 --> 40:07.404
Would you look at that.

41:17.208 --> 41:18.408
You okay?

41:18.410 --> 41:21.845
Yeah, yeah.

41:43.300 --> 41:45.969
Was it something that I said?

41:45.971 --> 41:51.007
No, no, no, she practices a lot.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.243
Why does she do it?

41:53.245 --> 41:54.777
What?

41:54.779 --> 41:56.946
Dancing and all of that?

41:56.948 --> 41:59.949
The audition.

41:59.951 --> 42:02.919
She's almost already too old.

42:02.921 --> 42:06.990
It's like how I need
to keep studying.

42:06.992 --> 42:07.891
I understand.

42:07.893 --> 42:10.860
There is people in town

42:10.862 --> 42:13.196
who still check their
mailbox every morning

42:13.198 --> 42:15.932
even though there
hasn't been mail in forever.

42:15.934 --> 42:18.134
It's a fugue state.

42:18.136 --> 42:20.470
It's like a what?

42:20.472 --> 42:27.010
Oh, it's like when you forget
everything.

42:27.012 --> 42:31.347
And you're in this weird state.

42:31.349 --> 42:35.084
You don't realize anything
that's happened to you before.

42:35.086 --> 42:39.022
You seem normal in every
other way.

42:39.024 --> 42:42.825
A fugue state.

42:42.827 --> 42:44.928
A fugue state.

42:44.930 --> 42:46.362
That makes sense.

42:52.903 --> 42:57.240
I mean we can't give up Eli.

42:57.242 --> 42:59.008
We just can't.

43:07.785 --> 43:09.118
We're almost out of toothpaste.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.253
I know.

43:16.894 --> 43:20.229
So how long is he gonna stay?

43:20.231 --> 43:22.031
I don't know.

43:22.033 --> 43:25.168
'Cause he's eating our food
and we hardly have any left.

43:29.873 --> 43:31.407
Why don't you like him?

43:37.381 --> 43:38.314
Just don't get pregnant, okay?

43:38.316 --> 43:39.115
That's all I ask.

43:39.117 --> 43:40.249
What?

43:40.251 --> 43:41.851
What are you saying?

43:41.853 --> 43:43.186
I'm saying we don't need
a baby right now

43:43.188 --> 43:45.054
and you know he'd be gone
in a second.

44:00.237 --> 44:06.209
Things are starting up again
back east, Nelly.

44:06.211 --> 44:12.448
They've got electricity there
and people have jobs.

44:12.450 --> 44:15.018
The phones are working.

44:15.020 --> 44:15.985
Food in the stores.

44:15.987 --> 44:17.954
No looting.

44:17.956 --> 44:19.088
What?

44:19.090 --> 44:22.258
I want you to go with me,
Nelly.

44:22.260 --> 44:25.361
Why didn't you tell us
this sooner?

44:25.363 --> 44:32.168
Well, I wanted to see
who you were first.

44:32.170 --> 44:35.438
What do you mean
"who you were"?

44:35.440 --> 44:37.340
If you were the one.

44:41.912 --> 44:45.314
You're going to walk
to Boston?

44:45.316 --> 44:46.549
How long is that gonna take?

44:46.551 --> 44:47.884
Eight, eight and a half months.

44:47.886 --> 44:49.085
So into the winter?

44:49.087 --> 44:50.186
Yeah.

44:50.188 --> 44:51.554
What if you don't make it
that far?

44:51.556 --> 44:53.389
Then we'll hole up somewhere.

44:53.391 --> 44:54.624
Where?

44:54.626 --> 44:57.260
Who's going to take in an
extra half-dozen starving people

44:57.262 --> 44:58.494
for the winter?

44:58.496 --> 45:00.096
We'll make ends meet,
Joe's got a rifle.

45:00.098 --> 45:01.964
If you guys come,
there's another gun, too.

45:01.966 --> 45:02.632
We'll work the land.

45:02.634 --> 45:04.100
We'll hunt.

45:04.102 --> 45:05.168
We'll make it work.

45:05.170 --> 45:06.436
You know how to hunt?

45:06.438 --> 45:07.103
Sure, why not?

45:07.105 --> 45:08.071
I'm a fast learner.

45:08.073 --> 45:09.572
Boston has something
we don't?

45:09.574 --> 45:10.239
Yeah, power.

45:10.241 --> 45:11.074
Food. Jobs.

45:11.076 --> 45:12.442
It's just another rumor!

45:12.444 --> 45:14.877
Eva, come on.

45:14.879 --> 45:16.412
Come with us.

45:16.414 --> 45:18.881
It'll be an adventure.

45:18.883 --> 45:21.517
You wait here,
nothing's gonna happen.

45:21.519 --> 45:21.517
It's not fair.

45:21.519 --> 45:25.655
It's not fair to your sister.

45:34.598 --> 45:41.404
Well, mom always said
you're your own person.

45:41.406 --> 45:42.238
Nell's her own person.

45:42.240 --> 45:44.273
She'll go if she wants.

45:52.149 --> 45:52.949
Here.

45:52.951 --> 45:54.550
No.

45:54.552 --> 45:56.152
You're gonna need it
more than me.

45:56.154 --> 45:57.754
No, his brother has one.

46:05.395 --> 46:11.701
I'm sorry I didn't let you
use the gas.

46:11.703 --> 46:16.706
I was thinking we could stay
one more night

46:16.708 --> 46:22.345
and have like a big party
and watch you dance.

46:22.347 --> 46:24.680
No. If you've gotta go,
you gotta go.

46:31.555 --> 46:38.161
But Eva, we're the only
family either one of us has.

46:38.163 --> 46:40.396
We need to stick together.

46:40.398 --> 46:45.735
Hey, hey, hey.

46:45.737 --> 46:48.404
We both made our choices.

46:56.213 --> 46:59.415
Bye, Nelly.

46:59.417 --> 47:02.285
Hey, I'm always gonna be
your sister.

47:59.810 --> 48:01.377
Aaagh!

48:29.206 --> 48:31.440
Let's call it a night, then.

48:31.442 --> 48:33.609
Okay.

49:02.339 --> 49:03.806
Eli?

49:12.149 --> 49:14.250
I'm not going.

49:18.121 --> 49:19.622
What?

49:22.426 --> 49:24.694
I'm not going.

49:30.834 --> 49:32.802
You're not going?

49:35.772 --> 49:39.475
I can't leave Eva.

49:39.477 --> 49:42.178
Nell, would she leave you?

49:42.180 --> 49:42.845
No, she wouldn't.

49:42.847 --> 49:43.746
She's not here, is she?

49:43.748 --> 49:46.148
She wouldn't come with you.

49:46.150 --> 49:47.650
Well, that's different.

50:03.600 --> 50:05.234
Here.

50:05.236 --> 50:07.770
Take this.

50:07.772 --> 50:09.405
I know you're low on matches.

50:09.407 --> 50:12.708
Wow.

50:12.710 --> 50:14.944
Thanks.

50:14.946 --> 50:16.979
Thanks.

50:23.920 --> 50:26.389
I love you however I can.

50:32.929 --> 50:34.597
Bye.

50:34.599 --> 50:36.632
Yeah.

50:51.648 --> 50:54.483
Eva!

50:54.485 --> 50:55.451
Eva!

51:07.264 --> 51:08.597
I'm so sorry.

51:08.599 --> 51:10.366
I'm so sorry.

51:14.571 --> 51:15.671
Oh, Nell.

51:49.739 --> 51:53.442
Persuane.

51:53.444 --> 51:53.442
Shepherd's purse.

51:53.444 --> 51:57.546
I still can't believe all of
this was here the whole time.

51:59.749 --> 52:01.050
Hey, hey.

52:01.052 --> 52:01.951
What's this?

52:01.953 --> 52:03.419
What's this one?

52:07.958 --> 52:09.525
Is this it?

52:12.996 --> 52:16.432
It's a Laurel Berry.

52:16.434 --> 52:20.536
It's an anti-inflammatory.

52:20.538 --> 52:22.138
Black currant.

53:41.786 --> 53:43.919
Thank you.

53:43.921 --> 53:45.688
Thank you.

53:48.458 --> 53:49.658
Let's drink.

53:49.660 --> 53:52.728
I thought we were saving
this for...

53:52.730 --> 53:55.397
A snake bite or childbirth
or something.

53:55.399 --> 53:58.901
Well, there will be no
childbirth around here

53:58.903 --> 54:00.636
any time soon.

54:00.638 --> 54:01.837
Come on!

54:08.712 --> 54:10.145
Oh my god.

54:10.147 --> 54:12.081
Uuuugh.

54:12.083 --> 54:13.949
Okay, we're getting drunk.

54:20.490 --> 54:22.057
Old people booze.

54:22.059 --> 54:23.592
It's gross.

54:23.594 --> 54:24.660
Oranges. It's good for you.

54:24.662 --> 54:24.660
Oh yeah.

54:24.662 --> 54:26.729
-Vitamin c.
-Oh, vitamin c.

54:26.731 --> 54:31.734
Your immune system, it
builds the immune system.

54:38.742 --> 54:42.111
You know what I was thinking?

54:42.113 --> 54:47.516
We could afford a few minutes
of music.

54:47.518 --> 54:48.617
Are you serious?

54:48.619 --> 54:51.086
Yeah.

54:51.088 --> 54:52.488
Like, right now?

54:52.490 --> 54:57.192
Sure!

54:57.194 --> 55:00.562
I don't know, I think
i kinda wanna...

55:00.564 --> 55:03.132
Like, save it so I can look
forward to it.

55:04.602 --> 55:05.467
Okay.

55:05.469 --> 55:06.935
I'm serious.

55:06.937 --> 55:07.936
Now's the time.

55:09.173 --> 55:10.172
No, it's not.

55:10.174 --> 55:11.573
It is, too!

55:11.575 --> 55:12.941
Remember what dad
used to say?

55:12.943 --> 55:14.176
What did he call it?

55:14.178 --> 55:17.212
Uh... the um...
Snots too wars.

55:17.214 --> 55:18.681
Oh my god.

55:18.683 --> 55:21.717
Is not, is too, is not,
is too...

55:21.719 --> 55:24.286
Snots too,
snots too, snots too!

55:39.636 --> 55:41.036
Still no signal.

55:41.038 --> 55:42.204
<i> Nothing?</i>

55:44.674 --> 55:45.708
No Internet.

55:50.680 --> 55:53.349
But there's popcorn!

56:04.562 --> 56:06.128
Action!

56:24.315 --> 56:28.117
Isn't he handsome?

58:55.231 --> 58:57.165
Hey, so those blueberries
should be ripe.

58:57.167 --> 58:59.368
They're just past the bridge,
so I don't know,

58:59.370 --> 59:01.270
I'll be like a couple hours?

59:01.272 --> 59:03.939
Oh, I can taste it already.

59:03.941 --> 59:04.940
Blueberry crumble!

59:04.942 --> 59:06.074
Yeah.

59:06.076 --> 59:07.843
But without the crumble.

59:45.281 --> 59:47.950
Hiya.

59:47.952 --> 59:49.284
It's okay, I'm sorry.

59:49.286 --> 59:51.320
Hi.

59:51.322 --> 59:53.355
Hi.

59:53.357 --> 59:56.024
Do you remember me?

59:56.026 --> 01:00:00.295
Uh, Stan.

01:00:00.297 --> 01:00:01.496
Yeah.

01:00:01.498 --> 01:00:04.299
Wow, you do remember.

01:00:04.301 --> 01:00:07.803
Well, you have your...

01:00:07.805 --> 01:00:13.842
Oh, yeah.

01:00:13.844 --> 01:00:15.410
You're Eva.

01:00:15.412 --> 01:00:17.512
I remember.

01:00:17.514 --> 01:00:21.083
Yeah.

01:00:21.085 --> 01:00:25.153
What're you doing up here?

01:00:25.155 --> 01:00:27.823
Uh, I was heading north to visit
a friend in grantsville

01:00:27.825 --> 01:00:30.425
and I heard your axe
and uh...

01:00:30.427 --> 01:00:33.228
Smelled your smoke and
just thought I'd come by

01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:35.364
to see if you're okay.

01:00:41.437 --> 01:00:43.905
So have you heard any news
or anything?

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:46.908
Nope.

01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:49.511
We heard things might be
picking up back east, but...

01:00:49.513 --> 01:00:51.079
Who told you that?

01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:51.913
A friend.

01:00:51.915 --> 01:00:55.083
A friend?

01:00:55.085 --> 01:00:57.352
You've got friends up here?

01:00:57.354 --> 01:01:00.222
Yeah.

01:01:00.224 --> 01:01:03.191
I heard that stuff
about Boston, too.

01:01:03.193 --> 01:01:06.595
I even heard there's some fools
who took off,

01:01:06.597 --> 01:01:10.132
chasing rumors
across the country.

01:01:10.134 --> 01:01:12.534
They won't last long.

01:01:12.536 --> 01:01:15.937
Yeah.

01:01:15.939 --> 01:01:18.573
Well, you girls sure do have
a good sized wood pile there.

01:01:18.575 --> 01:01:20.876
That's good.

01:01:20.878 --> 01:01:23.545
Yeah.

01:01:23.547 --> 01:01:27.249
Did you chop all that wood
by yourself?

01:01:27.251 --> 01:01:28.450
My father cut it.

01:01:28.452 --> 01:01:30.018
Your father?

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:33.155
Your father around here?

01:01:33.157 --> 01:01:33.855
Yeah.

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:34.856
Yeah, he's around.

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:36.358
Yeah? Where is he?

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:40.295
I just want to talk to him
and see what he knows.

01:01:40.297 --> 01:01:41.363
He's in the woods.

01:01:41.365 --> 01:01:42.364
In the woods.

01:01:42.366 --> 01:01:43.432
Sure.

01:01:43.434 --> 01:01:44.633
He's coming back any minute.

01:01:44.635 --> 01:01:49.604
Sure, yeah.

01:01:49.606 --> 01:01:52.140
I think I'll just stick around
until your dad gets back.

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:07.322
Sorry if I scared you.

01:02:07.324 --> 01:02:08.523
You know, you shouldn't
be scared.

01:02:08.525 --> 01:02:12.594
It's just, you know,
it's hard times.

01:02:12.596 --> 01:02:13.962
It's hard.

01:02:30.113 --> 01:02:34.449
No! No!

01:02:37.354 --> 01:02:41.256
No!

01:02:47.598 --> 01:02:49.531
No!

01:02:49.533 --> 01:02:51.299
Stop!

01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:55.237
Please!

01:03:38.715 --> 01:03:40.415
Eva!

01:03:43.619 --> 01:03:46.188
Eva!

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:48.590
Eva!

01:03:48.592 --> 01:03:53.528
Eva!

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:55.330
What happened?!

01:03:55.332 --> 01:03:58.166
What happened?!

01:04:05.107 --> 01:04:07.375
I will fucking kill you!

01:04:10.713 --> 01:04:13.582
I will fucking kill you!

01:04:20.424 --> 01:04:21.256
Eva!

01:04:21.258 --> 01:04:22.390
Eva!

01:04:22.392 --> 01:04:23.391
He's gone.

01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:24.726
He's gone.

01:04:24.728 --> 01:04:27.395
Yeah, he's gone sweetie.

01:04:27.397 --> 01:04:28.563
I got you.

01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:29.464
You're okay.

01:04:29.466 --> 01:04:30.465
You're okay.

01:04:30.467 --> 01:04:32.300
You're okay.

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:06.735
Take this aspirin.

01:05:09.105 --> 01:05:09.771
It's the last one.

01:05:09.773 --> 01:05:11.373
We should save it.

01:05:11.375 --> 01:05:13.341
Take it.

01:05:13.343 --> 01:05:14.743
I'll just take half.

01:05:14.745 --> 01:05:16.678
Eva.

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:38.166
I miss mom.

01:05:44.373 --> 01:05:48.243
She loved you so much.

01:05:48.245 --> 01:05:54.816
When you danced together,
it was like seeing double.

01:05:54.818 --> 01:05:58.186
She really loved you, too.

01:06:00.656 --> 01:06:02.390
Yeah.

01:06:09.865 --> 01:06:14.302
I miss dad, too.

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:30.618
Here.

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:34.222
Eva, please.

01:06:34.224 --> 01:06:36.291
I'm not hungry.

01:06:36.293 --> 01:06:39.494
Please.

01:06:46.736 --> 01:06:50.438
Today we are serving
some worm-free rice

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:53.641
with 14, count them,
14 kidney beans.

01:06:53.643 --> 01:06:58.013
And the piece de resistance,
a cup of white tea madam.

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:06.548
Where did you get the gas?

01:08:06.550 --> 01:08:08.917
Huh?

01:08:08.919 --> 01:08:10.452
I thought he stole it.

01:08:10.454 --> 01:08:12.987
No, I hid it.

01:08:12.989 --> 01:08:14.489
From me?

01:08:14.491 --> 01:08:17.725
From rash decisions.

01:08:17.727 --> 01:08:19.594
That's good, I guess.

01:08:21.665 --> 01:08:23.564
Come on, I thought
you'd like it.

01:08:23.567 --> 01:08:25.800
I thought we could dance...

01:08:25.801 --> 01:08:29.270
Have some fun.

01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:30.971
Just let it go.

01:09:54.055 --> 01:09:56.858
Oh my god.

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:58.793
<i> It's a note from dad!</i>

01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:02.697
Look!

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:14.609
Do you think he left it in
case something happened?

01:10:14.611 --> 01:10:17.111
Let's make this special.

01:10:17.113 --> 01:10:20.882
Let's go outside and read it.

01:10:20.884 --> 01:10:21.816
Come on.

01:10:21.818 --> 01:10:23.218
I'll get the gun.

01:10:29.825 --> 01:10:31.226
Eva, come on.

01:12:18.201 --> 01:12:20.134
Eva!

01:12:20.136 --> 01:12:21.169
What? What?

01:12:21.171 --> 01:12:24.772
I hurt my back!

01:12:24.774 --> 01:12:25.573
Are you okay?

01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:26.974
No!

01:12:26.976 --> 01:12:33.047
Ow, oh, ow.

01:12:33.049 --> 01:12:35.049
Fuck.

01:12:35.051 --> 01:12:36.250
Okay.

01:12:36.252 --> 01:12:37.885
Okay, okay.

01:12:39.221 --> 01:12:40.788
Hey.

01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:42.190
Here.

01:12:42.192 --> 01:12:43.925
Just lay down.

01:12:43.927 --> 01:12:45.093
If you don't listen to your back

01:12:45.095 --> 01:12:47.962
then it's just going to
fight you forever, so here.

01:13:45.288 --> 01:13:48.956
Eva, what?

01:13:48.958 --> 01:13:52.927
What?

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:06.240
I just get so scared.

01:14:06.242 --> 01:14:09.911
I can't stop it.

01:14:09.913 --> 01:14:16.984
It just feels like...
These black waves, and i-

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:19.020
I swim up to the surface,

01:14:19.022 --> 01:14:22.824
and i- I think
I'll do okay and I can-

01:14:22.826 --> 01:14:26.260
I can fight this.

01:14:26.262 --> 01:14:28.696
And then another
black wave comes

01:14:28.698 --> 01:14:31.933
and I'm just drowning, and-

01:14:34.037 --> 01:14:36.704
sweetie.

01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:47.682
It's okay.

01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:53.054
I got you.

01:14:53.056 --> 01:14:54.822
It's okay.

01:15:30.994 --> 01:15:34.395
Is it food poisoning?

01:15:34.397 --> 01:15:36.931
It could be dysentery
or cholera.

01:15:36.933 --> 01:15:38.399
Oh, Jesus, Nell.

01:15:38.401 --> 01:15:39.834
Sorry.

01:15:39.836 --> 01:15:43.037
It's okay.

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:45.172
Are you okay?

01:15:45.174 --> 01:15:48.342
Yeah, I'm just...
I'm just queasy.

01:15:48.344 --> 01:15:50.545
I'm going to go lay down.

01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:01.822
Hey.

01:16:01.824 --> 01:16:03.324
Hey!

01:16:03.326 --> 01:16:06.761
What're you doing?

01:16:06.763 --> 01:16:08.796
I was just looking up um...
Canning techniques,

01:16:08.798 --> 01:16:11.832
'cause we have to store enough
food for the two of us

01:16:11.834 --> 01:16:12.800
for the winter.

01:16:12.802 --> 01:16:14.101
That's a lot.

01:16:14.103 --> 01:16:18.039
There's gonna be three of us.

01:16:18.041 --> 01:16:22.843
There's a baby coming.

01:16:22.845 --> 01:16:25.780
Oh.

01:16:25.782 --> 01:16:27.081
Yeah.

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:30.351
Yeah, I was afraid of that.

01:16:30.353 --> 01:16:32.053
It's okay.

01:16:32.055 --> 01:16:33.988
It's okay, we'll figure it out.

01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:35.523
Right?

01:16:35.525 --> 01:16:39.060
Figure what out?

01:16:39.062 --> 01:16:42.997
Surely you're not against
stopping an unwanted pregnancy.

01:16:42.999 --> 01:16:46.467
No, I don't think any baby
should be unwanted.

01:16:46.469 --> 01:16:49.337
Well, there might be
a safe way-

01:16:49.339 --> 01:16:51.072
I want it.

01:16:57.813 --> 01:17:03.017
I don't think I can lose
anything else, Nell.

01:17:03.019 --> 01:17:06.487
Eva, you were raped.

01:17:06.489 --> 01:17:08.222
That has nothing to do with it.

01:17:08.224 --> 01:17:11.258
Yeah, it's his kid.

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.860
I don't think the kid
is responsible

01:17:12.862 --> 01:17:16.263
for the parents' actions.

01:17:16.265 --> 01:17:19.066
Anyway, how could this baby
even be mine?

01:17:19.068 --> 01:17:23.437
What does that mean?

01:17:23.439 --> 01:17:25.306
It's its own person.

01:17:32.247 --> 01:17:34.215
Fuck, I'm hungry.

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:50.464
Listen: If fatigue and nausea
are present

01:17:50.466 --> 01:17:54.035
in the second and third
trimester, microcytic anemia,

01:17:54.037 --> 01:17:57.471
caused by a lack of b12,
may be suspect,

01:17:57.473 --> 01:17:59.840
which may cause
postpartum hemorrhage

01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:03.344
and brain and nerve damage
in the neonate.

01:18:03.346 --> 01:18:05.346
Maybe we should call
him neonate.

01:18:05.348 --> 01:18:06.147
Eva.

01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.881
This is serious.

01:18:06.883 --> 01:18:09.216
You look like a ghost.

01:18:09.218 --> 01:18:11.252
I mean, brain damage.

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:16.290
B12...

01:18:23.065 --> 01:18:26.100
B12 is found in animal
and dairy products.

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:26.160
Please die.

01:19:26.162 --> 01:19:28.362
My sister's having a baby.

01:19:28.364 --> 01:19:30.464
I need you to die.

01:19:54.624 --> 01:19:56.223
Oh, shit.

01:20:50.512 --> 01:20:53.681
God, it'll be nice
to have soap again.

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:04.158
Mmm.

01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:05.025
It's good?

01:21:05.027 --> 01:21:06.160
So good!

01:21:06.162 --> 01:21:07.361
Good.

01:21:11.234 --> 01:21:14.301
He's gonna be a dancer.

01:21:14.303 --> 01:21:15.536
Feel.

01:21:21.276 --> 01:21:23.611
Or maybe she'll be
a furniture mover.

01:21:23.613 --> 01:21:24.812
No.

01:21:24.814 --> 01:21:26.680
It's gonna be a boy.

01:21:26.682 --> 01:21:31.151
A sweet, strong,
beautiful boy.

01:21:31.153 --> 01:21:33.187
I'll bet you the guess.

01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:34.455
Okay.

01:21:46.234 --> 01:21:49.336
A feast.

01:21:52.707 --> 01:21:54.275
What's that smell?

01:21:56.278 --> 01:21:59.079
Me?

01:21:59.081 --> 01:22:00.147
No.

01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.814
No, I don't know.

01:22:08.156 --> 01:22:12.293
Is this some, like, wacko
pregnancy thing?

01:22:12.295 --> 01:22:15.796
Like magical mystery
imaginary smells?

01:22:15.798 --> 01:22:17.231
No.

01:22:21.636 --> 01:22:24.305
It's like smoke,
but it's not ours.

01:22:41.623 --> 01:22:45.592
Can you smell it?

01:22:45.594 --> 01:22:46.593
You think he's come back?

01:22:46.595 --> 01:22:47.328
No.

01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:48.295
Is that his campfire?

01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:50.564
No. No.

01:22:50.566 --> 01:22:52.199
Why don't you think so?

01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:56.503
I don't know.

01:23:30.739 --> 01:23:31.805
Hide.

01:23:31.807 --> 01:23:34.341
Where?

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:35.743
By the kitchen door.

01:24:04.774 --> 01:24:06.273
What?

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:13.213
What is it?

01:24:13.215 --> 01:24:14.415
A beam fell.

01:24:14.417 --> 01:24:15.382
What?

01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:17.384
Oh my god.

01:24:24.293 --> 01:24:28.328
A contraction?

01:24:28.330 --> 01:24:29.930
I think so.

01:24:29.932 --> 01:24:31.665
Oh god.

01:24:35.937 --> 01:24:40.674
Okay, the average length
of labor is 16 to 18 hours.

01:24:43.378 --> 01:24:46.647
How long has it been?

01:24:46.649 --> 01:24:47.448
Five hours.

01:24:51.487 --> 01:24:52.519
Nelly.

01:24:52.521 --> 01:24:54.521
Yeah?

01:24:54.523 --> 01:24:58.358
It's really sweet of you
to do this.

01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:02.262
Of course.

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:04.665
What else are sisters for?

01:25:05.734 --> 01:25:07.434
Okay.

01:25:12.641 --> 01:25:17.044
Is it speeding up?

01:25:17.046 --> 01:25:18.846
I think you're stuck.

01:25:25.521 --> 01:25:26.787
The house is falling apart.

01:25:26.789 --> 01:25:29.022
I gotta get out of here.

01:25:29.024 --> 01:25:30.457
Okay.

01:25:30.459 --> 01:25:33.427
It'll be good for you to move.

01:25:33.429 --> 01:25:36.563
Do you think you can walk?

01:25:36.565 --> 01:25:38.765
Can you try?

01:25:38.767 --> 01:25:40.067
I'll try.

01:25:40.069 --> 01:25:41.368
I think it's gonna help.

01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:52.513
Careful.

01:26:39.094 --> 01:26:41.061
It's good here.

01:26:41.063 --> 01:26:42.496
It's good here.

01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:49.903
Okay?

01:26:49.905 --> 01:26:51.572
Okay.

01:26:51.574 --> 01:26:53.373
Okay.

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:54.508
Okay.

01:26:54.510 --> 01:26:56.376
Okay?

01:26:56.378 --> 01:27:01.515
Oooooh!

01:27:04.853 --> 01:27:05.986
You're okay.

01:27:05.988 --> 01:27:08.021
Okay, you're doing so good.

01:27:08.023 --> 01:27:12.893
Oh god, oh god!

01:27:22.904 --> 01:27:24.037
No, you're doing so good.

01:27:24.039 --> 01:27:25.105
You're almost there.

01:27:26.976 --> 01:27:29.042
Oh god, it's coming!

01:27:29.044 --> 01:27:32.179
It's coming, I can feel it!

01:27:32.181 --> 01:27:34.014
I can feel it!

01:27:34.016 --> 01:27:35.916
Oh my god.

01:27:35.918 --> 01:27:38.452
You're okay.

01:27:38.454 --> 01:27:39.886
It's coming!

01:27:39.888 --> 01:27:41.588
Oh, god!

01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:42.889
It's coming!

01:27:42.891 --> 01:27:45.192
Holy shit!

01:27:46.762 --> 01:27:47.661
Push!

01:27:47.663 --> 01:27:48.862
Okay.

01:27:48.864 --> 01:27:51.064
Push! Push!!!

01:27:54.636 --> 01:27:56.136
It's coming, one more push!

01:27:56.138 --> 01:27:56.970
One more push!

01:27:56.972 --> 01:27:59.773
One more push!

01:28:19.927 --> 01:28:22.229
Oh my god!

01:28:35.009 --> 01:28:36.543
Oh, it's okay.

01:28:36.545 --> 01:28:37.544
Oh, it's okay.

01:28:37.546 --> 01:28:40.847
Oh, I've got you.

01:28:40.849 --> 01:28:42.149
Yeah.

01:28:51.659 --> 01:28:55.162
Oh, I'm going to love you
my whole life!

01:28:55.164 --> 01:28:57.130
Hi, baby!

01:28:57.132 --> 01:29:00.534
Oh my god!

01:29:00.536 --> 01:29:02.803
You did it.

01:29:24.292 --> 01:29:27.861
Well, you were right.

01:29:27.863 --> 01:29:33.800
He's a sweet, smart, strong,
beautiful boy.

01:29:43.845 --> 01:29:47.314
Yeah.

01:29:47.316 --> 01:29:49.950
Stretch.

01:30:17.678 --> 01:30:19.746
Oh my god.

01:30:19.748 --> 01:30:21.081
It smells foul in here.

01:30:22.317 --> 01:30:23.950
Shhh.

01:30:27.789 --> 01:30:29.723
Okay.

01:30:29.725 --> 01:30:31.057
Eva?

01:30:31.059 --> 01:30:32.359
It's okay.

01:30:32.361 --> 01:30:33.927
Eva?

01:30:34.962 --> 01:30:37.097
Eva?

01:30:37.099 --> 01:30:38.365
We can't stay here.

01:30:38.367 --> 01:30:38.365
What?

01:30:38.367 --> 01:30:40.367
The house is filled
with black mold.

01:30:40.369 --> 01:30:42.002
It's not safe for the baby.

01:30:45.907 --> 01:30:48.608
Here, take him.

01:30:48.610 --> 01:30:50.310
Eva.

01:30:50.312 --> 01:30:52.012
Here.

01:30:52.014 --> 01:30:53.780
Got him?

01:30:53.782 --> 01:30:55.115
-Yeah.
-Okay...

01:30:55.117 --> 01:30:56.683
Oh, little man.

01:30:56.685 --> 01:30:58.251
It's okay.

01:30:58.253 --> 01:31:03.323
Alright, I'm gonna get all
the food out of the house.

01:31:03.325 --> 01:31:06.927
Eva, what are you doing?

01:31:06.929 --> 01:31:08.662
Where's the gas?

01:31:08.664 --> 01:31:09.362
What?

01:31:09.364 --> 01:31:10.897
The gas.

01:31:10.899 --> 01:31:11.765
It's under the microwave.

01:31:11.767 --> 01:31:14.301
Why?

01:31:14.303 --> 01:31:16.403
I won the bet, right?

01:31:16.405 --> 01:31:18.905
I can use it any way I want.

01:31:18.907 --> 01:31:20.907
Yeah.

01:31:20.909 --> 01:31:23.643
I want to burn
the house down.

01:31:23.645 --> 01:31:25.111
What the fuck?!

01:31:27.348 --> 01:31:27.347
What the-

01:31:27.349 --> 01:31:30.283
sooner or later someone is
gonna come looking for us,

01:31:30.285 --> 01:31:32.252
right?

01:31:32.254 --> 01:31:33.753
If we leave the house here,
someone can move in,

01:31:33.755 --> 01:31:35.922
but if we burn it down, it'll
look like we died in the fire.

01:31:35.924 --> 01:31:36.857
Look at this place!

01:31:36.859 --> 01:31:40.861
It's toxic, it's rotting.

01:31:40.863 --> 01:31:42.162
We're never gonna fix
that roof.

01:31:42.164 --> 01:31:43.730
What if we start a forest fire?

01:31:43.732 --> 01:31:45.432
No, it's too wet.

01:31:47.902 --> 01:31:50.570
Alright, how long have human
beings been around?

01:31:50.572 --> 01:31:50.570
What?

01:31:50.572 --> 01:31:55.041
Seriously...How long have human
beings been around on earth?

01:31:55.043 --> 01:31:58.111
100--200,000 years.

01:31:58.113 --> 01:31:58.111
Right?

01:31:58.113 --> 01:32:01.748
How long have we had
electricity?

01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:02.949
140.

01:32:02.951 --> 01:32:03.850
Right.

01:32:03.852 --> 01:32:05.352
You see what I'm saying?

01:32:05.354 --> 01:32:08.021
This, all this.

01:32:08.023 --> 01:32:10.390
This is all we have.

01:32:10.392 --> 01:32:12.225
We have each other.

01:32:12.227 --> 01:32:13.293
We have plenty of food.

01:32:13.295 --> 01:32:15.362
We know how to get more.

01:32:15.364 --> 01:32:19.466
It's just not safe here anymore.

01:32:19.468 --> 01:32:25.038
We will be okay, Nellie.

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:30.010
It's the right thing to do.

01:32:42.723 --> 01:32:45.058
Just give me a moment.

01:33:54.895 --> 01:33:54.894
Okay.

01:33:54.896 --> 01:33:57.864
You wanna be the one to do it?

01:33:57.866 --> 01:33:59.299
Yeah.

01:33:59.301 --> 01:34:00.533
Here.
