00:00.203 --> 00:01.320
Previously on The Fosters...

00:01.323 --> 00:02.746
You think I hit my son in the face?

00:02.754 --> 00:03.820
I was trying to give him a spanking

00:03.872 --> 00:05.872
and he ran away from me into a doorjamb.

00:05.908 --> 00:07.874
And, quite frankly, this is all your fault.

00:07.910 --> 00:10.460
You were the chaperone on
a seventh grade camping trip

00:10.495 --> 00:12.512
and allowed our sons to spend
the night in a tent together,

00:12.547 --> 00:13.630
with out my permission.

00:13.665 --> 00:15.415
Did you quit your job because of me?

00:15.467 --> 00:18.468
I care more about defending you
than I do about keeping my job.

00:18.503 --> 00:20.587
You shouldn't, because we did
do something on the camping trip.

00:20.639 --> 00:21.838
I need an inventory.

00:21.890 --> 00:23.690
It's what they call it in AA.

00:23.725 --> 00:26.760
What I'm most ashamed of
is that I loved getting high

00:26.762 --> 00:27.761
more that I loved you.

00:27.813 --> 00:29.562
I wish we could adopt Callie.

00:29.598 --> 00:30.764
Dad didn't sign the papers.

00:30.816 --> 00:33.516
He did, but they didn't
actually ever get sent.

00:33.568 --> 00:35.485
Because I took them out of
the mail and ripped them up.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.821
I can't sign the papers again. I love you.

00:37.856 --> 00:39.689
I don't love you.

00:39.741 --> 00:40.941
- I'm your sister.
- No you're not,

00:40.943 --> 00:42.525
your a spoiled, little brat.

00:44.529 --> 00:46.780
- We can't do this.
- Well, I'm not getting adopted.

Please, hurry.

01:37.582 --> 01:39.666
OK, everybody back.
Let's give them some room.

01:39.718 --> 01:43.837
He was telling me he was upset about
a fight he'd just had with his...

01:43.889 --> 01:46.840
And he just grabbed his chest,
like, he couldn't breathe,

01:46.892 --> 01:50.760
and... and... and he started shaking,
I had to help him to the ground. Is he...

01:51.980 --> 01:53.780
What's happening?

02:35.436 --> 02:40.684
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

02:41.216 --> 02:42.282
Panic attack.

02:42.334 --> 02:44.251
It wasn't... it wasn't a heart attack?

02:44.286 --> 02:46.453
- Nope. Happens all the time.
- Really?

02:46.505 --> 02:51.258
The symptoms are pretty similar: chest
pain, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat...

02:51.293 --> 02:52.375
And you're sure?

02:52.427 --> 02:55.212
I'm pretty sure, yeah. The EKG looks fine.

02:55.264 --> 02:57.250
But we should probably take
you in for some observation,

02:57.251 --> 02:58.251
just to be 100 percent certain.

02:58.350 --> 02:59.466
No, no. I'm fine.

02:59.518 --> 03:02.469
No, Robert. You should...

03:02.521 --> 03:05.138
Ok, if you think I should.

03:05.140 --> 03:06.139
What's going on?

03:10.395 --> 03:12.135
I mean, he said he signed the papers.

03:12.136 --> 03:15.064
Shouldn't he have to, like, stick to that?

03:15.150 --> 03:16.566
You'd think so, wouldn't ya?

03:16.618 --> 03:19.319
Well, he was clearly
upset by the whole thing.

03:19.321 --> 03:24.157
I think... I hope, anyway, that with a little
time and space from the drama of it all,

03:24.159 --> 03:25.492
he'll come to his senses.

03:25.494 --> 03:27.377
You really think that's gonna happen?

03:27.412 --> 03:32.232
I do, actually. This all went down so fast,

03:32.267 --> 03:33.661
and there was so much emotion involved.

03:33.762 --> 03:36.543
He just needs a little room
to change his perspective.

03:36.588 --> 03:39.472
He's gonna do the right thing, I know it.

03:39.508 --> 03:44.244
I can't believe he pulled this.
He seemed like such a nice guy.

03:44.279 --> 03:45.612
Yeah, well, not everyone
is not what they seem.

03:45.647 --> 03:48.315
It's a lesson for all of us.

03:48.350 --> 03:51.585
Hey, Callie... hey.

03:51.620 --> 03:54.621
It's gonna be ok. We're
gonna work this out.

03:54.656 --> 03:57.190
You hear me?

03:57.226 --> 04:01.461
Ok. Ok, listen, why don't you all
go get changed out of your clothes.

04:01.496 --> 04:04.497
Put on something comfortable, we'll
put something out for dinner. Ok?

04:22.267 --> 04:25.435
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:25.470 --> 04:28.605
I was looking for you
before dinner, but I...

04:28.640 --> 04:33.276
No, I know. I, um... I
came out here hoping you...

04:33.312 --> 04:36.363
Yeah, I know, I saw you go so I figured...

04:38.483 --> 04:39.566
Callie...

04:42.237 --> 04:43.737
I...

04:43.739 --> 04:48.458
You know, actually, I don't think I can
handle anymore bad news today, Brandon.

04:50.579 --> 04:55.348
It's not bad news. Not really.

04:57.552 --> 05:00.253
I just don't want you to give up.

05:03.258 --> 05:07.177
I know. I know.

05:10.599 --> 05:14.484
OK. Good night, then.

05:14.519 --> 05:16.186
Night.

05:27.332 --> 05:29.165
- Hey.
- Hey, bub.

05:29.201 --> 05:31.151
I just wanted to check up on you.

05:31.186 --> 05:33.336
It's quite a day, huh?

05:35.207 --> 05:37.557
Are you all right?

05:37.592 --> 05:39.542
About all the Callie and Robert stuff?

05:39.594 --> 05:41.161
Yeah.

05:41.196 --> 05:42.462
It's gonna be ok though, right?

05:42.464 --> 05:44.464
Yes, honey... it's gonna be fine.

05:46.551 --> 05:51.171
And thank you for telling me about
what happened on the camping trip.

05:51.206 --> 05:55.141
I know that wasn't easy for you, and I
really appreciate your being honest with me.

05:58.413 --> 06:00.347
Are you gonna tell Connor's dad?

06:00.382 --> 06:03.366
Uh... no, I don't think so.

06:03.402 --> 06:06.419
I don't work at Anchor Beach
anymore, so I don't have to,

06:06.455 --> 06:11.574
and I really don't see any reason
to upset things any further.

06:16.465 --> 06:22.419
You know, honey, what you
guys did, it wasn't wrong.

06:22.471 --> 06:25.472
It just, it wasn't
appropriate on a school trip.

06:25.507 --> 06:31.478
I just don't want you to feel ashamed
for... you know, for being curious.

06:33.181 --> 06:35.231
- Ok.
- Ok.

06:44.526 --> 06:48.194
She's just devastated, as
I'm sure you can understand.

06:48.246 --> 06:52.365
So I was hoping that you...
you could talk to your husband.

06:52.401 --> 06:56.469
I know why you're here.
I understand completely.

06:58.540 --> 07:01.207
But I'm not sure I agree.

07:02.344 --> 07:05.211
I was with you, I really was.

07:05.263 --> 07:10.133
I knew that Robert and Sophia were
getting too invested in Callie,

07:10.185 --> 07:13.386
and I knew they were gonna get hurt,

07:13.438 --> 07:18.224
but I also knew that they would be fine,

07:18.260 --> 07:22.228
because they only want
what's best for Callie.

07:22.230 --> 07:24.497
And then it sort of dawned on me.

07:26.368 --> 07:30.403
They only want what's best for Callie.

07:30.405 --> 07:33.239
Because they love her.

07:33.291 --> 07:37.577
And when she called him
her father yesterday,

07:37.629 --> 07:41.381
seeing how he lit up and...

07:41.416 --> 07:43.550
And how devastated he
was that he upset her,

07:43.585 --> 07:46.386
he had a panic attack, for God's sake.

07:48.356 --> 07:50.256
I just...

07:51.476 --> 07:54.344
I just think he deserves
a chance to get to know her

07:54.396 --> 07:58.515
a little better before all this is decided.

08:01.319 --> 08:03.269
- Hi.
- Um...

08:03.321 --> 08:06.523
- I didn't know you were...
- Stef stopped by to talk about...

08:06.575 --> 08:08.241
Yesterday.

08:09.277 --> 08:11.361
Yeah, of course.

08:11.413 --> 08:17.200
All right, look, um... I feel awful
about everything that went down.

08:17.252 --> 08:18.501
Sincerely.

08:18.537 --> 08:21.121
I'm sure you do.

08:22.257 --> 08:24.207
And that's why I'm here.

08:24.259 --> 08:26.459
I'd just like to see you make things right.

08:26.461 --> 08:28.561
That's what I'm trying to do.

08:30.465 --> 08:33.466
No, Robert, I think you
need to sign the papers.

08:36.571 --> 08:42.525
Look, um... I just wanna have some
sort of relationship with my daughter.

08:42.561 --> 08:46.563
Well, she doesn't want to have
a relationship with you. Not now.

08:46.615 --> 08:50.617
And after that stunt yesterday, Lena and I
are not going to try to persuade her otherwise.

08:52.554 --> 08:57.574
Well, I've been trying to
figure out a way to handle this.

08:57.626 --> 09:01.161
I was hoping it would
be a little more civil,

09:01.213 --> 09:03.296
but you don't leave me any choice.

09:03.331 --> 09:05.415
You'll be hearing from my lawyers tomorrow.

09:05.467 --> 09:08.401
I'm gonna petition the court for custody.

09:16.123 --> 09:19.908
Damn. Good job.

09:21.795 --> 09:22.978
Hey...

09:23.013 --> 09:25.080
You ever been to one of
your dad's AA meetings?

09:25.082 --> 09:27.966
Like to see him get a chip or something?

09:28.001 --> 09:30.752
Uh, yeah, a couple times. Why?

09:30.804 --> 09:32.087
What's it like?

09:32.089 --> 09:37.092
AA? Kinda weird, but, you know,
my dad was happy I went though.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.143
Why was it weird?

09:38.178 --> 09:40.095
Uh, everyone's sitting around,

09:40.097 --> 09:42.097
talking about all the
horrible things they did,

09:42.099 --> 09:44.683
and then everyone else is laughing.

09:44.735 --> 09:45.684
Laughing at them?

09:45.736 --> 09:47.819
No, no, no, more like with them.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.988
Like, they've done worse stuff, so...

09:50.991 --> 09:52.157
What... what's the matter?

09:52.192 --> 09:54.109
You think you got a
little drinking problem?

09:55.996 --> 09:59.114
Is this... about Ana?

10:00.167 --> 10:03.001
Nah, I was just curious.

10:03.036 --> 10:06.121
OK. Dude, don't get all wrapped up in...

10:06.173 --> 10:09.007
So do you think it really works? AA?

10:09.042 --> 10:11.876
I think so, yeah. I hope so.

10:11.929 --> 10:14.879
I kinda have to, you know?

10:18.185 --> 10:19.968
All right, man, you're up.

10:20.887 --> 10:21.853
Right.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.774
- You know, maybe we should...
- Lower it?

10:25.809 --> 10:26.975
Yeah, lower it.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.027
One, two, three and four.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.146
And five, six, seven, eight.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.198
And one, two, three, four.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.150
Five, six and...

10:37.854 --> 10:39.037
That was really good.

10:39.089 --> 10:43.091
It was! Except for the end.

10:43.126 --> 10:45.160
Maybe we could, like, simplify it?

10:45.212 --> 10:48.046
We could, but, I mean, don't
you wanna end with a bang?

10:48.081 --> 10:49.831
You know, really impress the judges?

10:49.883 --> 10:51.132
You're gonna get it.

10:51.168 --> 10:54.135
When? The competition's this week!

10:54.171 --> 10:57.172
Maybe I should just give up my solo...

10:57.207 --> 11:00.725
- What? No, no. Absolutely not.
- It'd be better for the team.

11:00.761 --> 11:04.846
No, it wouldn't! Mariana,
when you're on, you're fierce.

11:04.848 --> 11:07.682
Hey, and I know you didn't make me
spend all my free time coaching you

11:07.734 --> 11:09.184
just so you could bail at the last minute.

11:09.186 --> 11:12.937
OK, now come on, let's do that last
eight. You just gotta spot that turn.

11:12.990 --> 11:14.072
- Ok?
- Ok.

11:14.107 --> 11:16.074
And five, six, seven, eight.

Come on, walk me out.

11:56.783 --> 11:59.734
So, apparently, we are good together.

11:59.786 --> 12:00.902
Mm.

12:00.954 --> 12:04.906
At least that's what your
sister thinks. What about you?

12:11.832 --> 12:13.882
What are you being so weird about?

12:13.917 --> 12:15.750
Nothing. I just...

12:15.752 --> 12:19.120
I just hope the band
doesn't go all Fleetwood Mac.

12:20.090 --> 12:21.923
No Doubt?

12:21.925 --> 12:23.091
Huh?

12:23.126 --> 12:27.095
I hope Brandon and Lou dating
doesn't ruin everything.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.764
Brandon and Lou are dating?

12:29.800 --> 12:32.100
Oh, my God. That makes sense.

12:32.152 --> 12:35.770
I was wondering why she kept
giving him those bedroom eyes.

12:35.772 --> 12:37.989
Don't worry, I'm sure
it's all gonna be fine...

12:39.776 --> 12:41.860
Come on, I gotta get home.

12:52.873 --> 12:56.007
Brandon, stop it.

13:01.014 --> 13:04.015
Why? Why did you have to go over there?

13:05.719 --> 13:07.051
Wait, you think this is my fault?

13:07.104 --> 13:09.137
Are you're kidding me!

13:09.189 --> 13:11.973
You think that Robert decided
that he wanted custody of Callie,

13:12.025 --> 13:13.836
simply because he saw
me standing on his patio?

13:13.837 --> 13:15.310
- Seriously?
- I'm sure it didn't help,

13:15.311 --> 13:17.061
seeing you standing there
all defensive and territorial!

13:17.114 --> 13:18.195
He was already upset.

13:18.196 --> 13:20.930
Why couldn't you just give
things a little time to cool down?

13:20.984 --> 13:24.903
You're so impulsive! You can't
ever leave well-enough alone.

13:24.955 --> 13:27.989
Well, I'm sorry, Lena, I am who I am.

13:27.991 --> 13:30.037
But I'm not gonna be
blamed for being impulsive

13:30.038 --> 13:32.190
by a woman who quit her job on a whim.

13:32.879 --> 13:35.130
I was trying to defend Jude.

13:35.165 --> 13:37.966
What do you think I was
trying to do for Callie?!

13:38.001 --> 13:39.834
And protect Jude from what?

13:39.836 --> 13:42.887
From getting into trouble for
the shenanigans in the tent?

13:42.923 --> 13:44.806
Which he actually did!

13:44.841 --> 13:49.978
I love this about you, how passionate
and idealistic you are, Lena,

13:50.013 --> 13:52.063
how you would do anything
to protect our kids,

13:52.098 --> 13:56.017
but by trying to protect one,
you are hurting all of them.

13:56.052 --> 13:57.185
Excuse me?

13:57.220 --> 13:59.954
We cannot raise this family on one salary.

13:59.990 --> 14:02.073
I'm gonna get another job.

14:03.193 --> 14:04.859
Before the mortgage is due?

14:12.752 --> 14:14.118
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to sleep on the couch.

14:14.171 --> 14:15.920
- No, you're not.
- You gonna stop me?

14:15.956 --> 14:17.121
You're not gonna sleep on the couch,

14:17.174 --> 14:18.706
because we have a house full of kids,

14:18.758 --> 14:20.008
and as soon as one of them sees you,

14:20.043 --> 14:21.843
they're all gonna know
that something's wrong,

14:21.878 --> 14:23.795
and we're gonna have five freaked
out teenagers and nobody wants that!

14:23.847 --> 14:27.048
So get your ass in bed! Please. Please.

14:36.142 --> 14:38.726
Listen...

14:40.981 --> 14:42.897
What are you doing? What is that?

14:42.899 --> 14:45.116
A wall.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.819
To make sure you don't touch me tonight.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.961
Well, you don't have to worry about that.

15:17.434 --> 15:20.152
I'm sorry.

15:20.187 --> 15:24.356
I know I was being all cranky on Saturday
when you went to that fundraiser thingy.

15:24.408 --> 15:26.441
You totally gave me the
silent treatment yesterday.

15:26.493 --> 15:28.243
I did not!

15:28.279 --> 15:31.446
Hayley, I texted you like 50 times...

15:31.498 --> 15:34.449
And I replied. Once.

15:34.451 --> 15:38.170
With a big pile of dookie
emoticon... that's not a reply.

15:38.205 --> 15:42.090
Ok, ok... I'm sorry.

15:42.126 --> 15:45.427
I was talking to my mom
about it and she was all,

15:45.462 --> 15:48.497
"Being there for people you care
about it is really important."

15:48.532 --> 15:52.467
And I know you care about Callie.
I mean, she's like your sister.

15:52.519 --> 15:56.104
And you care about me, right?

15:56.140 --> 15:58.473
Yeah, you know I do...

16:01.312 --> 16:03.362
So you're coming to the dance competition?

16:03.397 --> 16:06.114
My solo's, like, amazing.

16:06.150 --> 16:08.200
Yeah, my whole family is gonna be there.

16:08.235 --> 16:10.402
Your whole family is coming to see me?

16:10.454 --> 16:14.323
Yeah, well, I mean, I guess I am.

16:14.375 --> 16:16.325
Mariana's on the dance team, remember?

16:17.494 --> 16:20.245
Oh. Right.

16:24.335 --> 16:27.219
So I got a very interesting
phone call this morning.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.421
It seems one of the big-wigs at Idyllwild

16:29.473 --> 16:32.090
saw you play at some music
competition last fall,

16:32.142 --> 16:34.393
and would like to offer you a full ride

16:34.428 --> 16:37.062
to go to their summer music program.

16:37.097 --> 16:41.099
Yeah, I know, it's just one of the most
prestigious programs in the country.

16:41.151 --> 16:42.434
But I...

16:42.486 --> 16:45.020
Brandon, you know how this
looks on a college application?

16:45.072 --> 16:48.440
You can basically write your own ticket
to any music school in the country.

16:48.492 --> 16:52.027
No, I know, but my hand... remember?

16:52.079 --> 16:55.197
- Right...
- I mean, that competition was before all this happened.

16:55.249 --> 16:57.199
I can't play like that anymore.

16:57.201 --> 17:01.003
Ok, I hear you. But if you were
gonna give it one more shot,

17:01.038 --> 17:02.254
Idyllwild would be the place to do it.

17:02.289 --> 17:05.207
They got some of the
best teachers, experts...

17:05.259 --> 17:09.011
... therapists in the world.

17:09.046 --> 17:11.262
- But, I just...
- Will you think about it?

17:11.298 --> 17:13.432
I got a little time before
we need to let them know.

17:14.468 --> 17:19.021
All right.

17:19.056 --> 17:22.391
I just want you to know I hear your
concerns. It's not something I take lightly,

17:22.443 --> 17:26.028
and we'll review again at
the end of the year, ok?

17:26.063 --> 17:28.280
Anybody have any questions?

17:28.315 --> 17:30.282
I have a question...

17:50.087 --> 17:51.336
Hey.

17:54.258 --> 17:56.341
You don't have to avoid
me, ok. I'm not mad.

17:56.393 --> 18:01.013
You're not? You seemed
pretty mad the other day.

18:01.065 --> 18:04.149
Well, I'm over it, ok. It's fine.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.435
You just gotta stop telling
your moms everything, ok?

18:10.324 --> 18:12.107
Did your mom really quit her job?

18:15.029 --> 18:17.412
Why, like, because of my dad?

18:20.284 --> 18:23.452
Wow. Is she ok?

18:23.504 --> 18:25.287
I think so.

18:27.458 --> 18:30.175
- We're ok?
- Yeah.

18:33.380 --> 18:36.381
Did you do the science homework?
I didn't get it at all...

18:38.135 --> 18:40.385
Coach Kim wants everyone to read
the rules for the competition.

18:40.437 --> 18:42.471
A few years ago we lost
because of a technicality

18:42.523 --> 18:44.439
and she's all flipped out
that we're gonna, like,

18:44.475 --> 18:47.275
have the wrong barrettes or
something and get disqualified so...

18:49.113 --> 18:52.030
Really? Nobody?

18:57.321 --> 19:00.072
What? I like to be informed.

19:00.124 --> 19:04.993
Ok. So I've been thinking, and I think we
need to rearrange the orders of the solos.

19:05.045 --> 19:08.246
Wait, the competition is tomorrow,
why are we making changes?

19:08.298 --> 19:10.248
I think we have to flip
Mariana's and David's,

19:10.300 --> 19:12.167
so when we end up in
formation for the last section,

19:12.169 --> 19:14.052
we make a better inverted triangle.

19:14.088 --> 19:15.053
So I'm still third?

19:16.256 --> 19:18.140
And I'm last?

19:20.144 --> 19:22.094
But the music's really
different at that part.

19:22.146 --> 19:25.263
It's still two counts of eight.
Can we just try it please?

20:08.275 --> 20:10.325
That was beautiful.

20:12.279 --> 20:14.112
Thank you.

20:14.148 --> 20:16.148
Where is this coming from?

20:16.200 --> 20:22.070
Um... I got offered a scholarship
for this summer program.

20:22.072 --> 20:25.123
- Um... Idyllwild, if you've...
- Yeah, of course.

20:25.159 --> 20:27.375
- Yeah.
- That's so cool.

20:28.345 --> 20:30.128
Yeah.

20:31.114 --> 20:32.297
Hungry.

20:38.172 --> 20:41.473
Two-thirds or sixth... that's
not... I don't know, bud.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.425
You're going to have to talk to
one of your siblings about this,

20:43.477 --> 20:46.144
'cause back in my day,
math did not look like that.

20:46.180 --> 20:48.096
Hey...

20:48.098 --> 20:52.484
Hey. So, I have got good
news and I have some...

20:52.519 --> 20:54.486
... less good news.

20:54.521 --> 20:57.405
The good news is, I got my job back.

20:58.575 --> 21:01.443
You did?

21:01.445 --> 21:07.449
And the less good news is
I'm going need to sit down

21:07.451 --> 21:11.119
with Connor and his dad and
talk about the camping trip.

21:11.171 --> 21:14.422
It's important to Monte, and, to be
honest, it's important to me, too.

21:14.458 --> 21:17.175
There are some things, as
a mom, that I can overlook,

21:17.211 --> 21:21.346
but that as an administrator, I have
to deal with, and this is one of them.

21:21.381 --> 21:24.049
But, I'm sure everything's gonna be fine.

21:24.101 --> 21:27.185
I don't want you to worry, ok.
I just wanted to let you know.

21:28.538 --> 21:30.305
Ok.

21:45.489 --> 21:48.356
You roll over anymore I'm
giving you a dog treat.

21:50.327 --> 21:54.496
I'm sorry, I'm just freaking out
about the competition tomorrow.

21:54.564 --> 21:58.166
I know it's stupid, it's just a contest.

21:58.218 --> 22:00.502
No, it's not stupid.

22:00.504 --> 22:04.339
You've been working really
hard and it's important to you.

22:04.341 --> 22:09.144
Well, yeah, but it's kind of nothing
compared to what you're going through.

22:10.480 --> 22:12.514
You know what game no one wins?

22:12.549 --> 22:16.351
Let's Rank Our Troubles.
Besides, it's super not fun.

22:18.438 --> 22:21.156
I'm just sorry I have to work

22:21.191 --> 22:25.360
so I'm gonna miss your big
win... unless you blow it.

22:35.138 --> 22:37.072
Hey, is Brandon with Lou?

22:37.107 --> 22:41.209
Oh, yeah. Totally. Mat's,
like, freaking out about it.

22:41.244 --> 22:44.379
He's almost 100 percent sure they're
walking into, like, a "No Doubt" situation,

22:44.381 --> 22:47.315
which I totally didn't get until
he told me that Gwen Stefani

22:47.351 --> 22:51.436
used to be with that drummer
guy... or wait, which one was it?

22:51.488 --> 22:54.522
Which one has the crazy eyes? Anyway...

22:54.558 --> 22:57.058
We should probably get some sleep.

22:57.110 --> 23:00.111
Yeah, right. Like that's gonna happen.

23:07.342 --> 23:09.162
Jude, why don't you tell
Mr. Stevens what you told me,

23:09.163 --> 23:10.937
about what happened in the tent.

23:13.062 --> 23:16.030
So, um, that night, after bed check,

23:16.065 --> 23:21.168
we had some girls come into our tent
and we played some games and stuff.

23:21.204 --> 23:26.240
Then we ending up making
out with them and...

23:26.292 --> 23:30.461
- And?
- Uh, nothing. That's it.

23:32.131 --> 23:34.248
Well, that was exactly
what I was afraid of...

23:34.250 --> 23:36.500
- Is it? Exactly?
- Yeah. It is.

23:36.552 --> 23:41.055
Look, I know you think I'm some sort of
big homophobe or something, but I'm not.

23:41.090 --> 23:44.475
I just want to make sure that my kid's
properly supervised when he's supposed to be.

23:47.180 --> 23:50.131
You're absolutely right, sir.
We hear you, loud and clear,

23:50.166 --> 23:52.366
and we are gonna make some
changes in the way we...

23:52.567 --> 23:54.360
we chaperone trips like these.

23:55.271 --> 23:59.340
Thank you. I just want
Connor to be able to be a kid.

23:59.525 --> 24:01.625
Not grow up so fast.

24:01.644 --> 24:04.595
But he is growing up,

24:04.647 --> 24:07.431
and, maybe you're right about one thing,

24:07.483 --> 24:10.234
he's getting a little old for
me to be spanking him, so...

24:10.269 --> 24:14.188
You're still grounded, but that's it. Ok?

24:14.296 --> 24:18.498
Well, I think it's safe to say we
all learned a little something here.

24:18.550 --> 24:20.600
Why don't you head back to class.

24:27.476 --> 24:30.477
Well, that's good your Dad's being cool.

24:30.512 --> 24:33.647
I can't believe you told your mom. Again.

24:33.682 --> 24:35.682
- I didn't tell...
- I can't... I...

24:35.734 --> 24:39.519
I can't be friends with a little bitch that
tells his mom every time something happens.

24:50.582 --> 24:53.283
Oh! You made it!

24:53.335 --> 24:55.619
Like I was gonna miss a
chance to see you shine.

24:57.372 --> 25:00.206
Aw, thank you.

25:00.709 --> 25:02.592
I'm really proud of you.

25:06.431 --> 25:09.215
Wow. They're really good.

25:09.267 --> 25:11.685
- I know.
- Mariana.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.437
Oops, gotta go.

25:14.473 --> 25:16.473
I'll be the one hollering the loudest.

25:19.227 --> 25:21.361
Ok, so I've been doing a little recon,

25:21.396 --> 25:23.279
and after seeing what
the other teams are doing,

25:23.315 --> 25:24.648
I think we should cut
that last solo and put in

25:24.700 --> 25:26.566
that double time section
we've been working on.

25:26.618 --> 25:29.319
Wait... you're cutting my solo?

25:29.371 --> 25:32.455
- What the hell?
- I'm sorry, but it's the weakest one.

25:32.491 --> 25:35.458
No, it's not! And why do we
have to cut a solo anyway?

25:35.494 --> 25:37.577
We need a bigger finish if we're gonna win.

25:37.579 --> 25:39.546
And Mariana was a hot
mess at practice yesterday.

25:39.581 --> 25:41.581
Yeah, because you changed her placement!

25:41.633 --> 25:45.552
The music was totally different! I
mean, you basically sabotaged her.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.554
I'm sorry, are you
accusing me of something?

25:47.589 --> 25:50.306
Yeah, I'm accusing you of being a jerk.

25:50.342 --> 25:54.260
Well, this jerk happens to be team
captain, and since Coach Kim isn't here,

25:54.262 --> 25:57.347
what I say, goes. If you don't
like it, you don't have to dance.

25:57.399 --> 25:58.481
What did you just say?

25:58.517 --> 26:01.401
Come on, Kaitlyn. Tia's
like our best dancer.

26:01.436 --> 26:03.570
- You don't have to do this.
- You heard me.

26:03.605 --> 26:07.574
This is a really important competition
for us and I don't think Mariana is ready.

26:07.609 --> 26:10.276
If you disagree, you don't
have to be on the team.

26:10.278 --> 26:14.664
You know what? You're
right, I don't. I quit.

26:16.585 --> 26:18.451
Good luck, guys.

26:28.296 --> 26:29.629
Your Honor, we found him, like you wanted.

26:29.681 --> 26:32.348
Uh, we served him papers, like you asked.

26:32.384 --> 26:34.367
- Um, he even signed them.
- So where are they?

26:34.403 --> 26:37.437
Well, from what I can gather,
his daughter destroyed them.

26:39.274 --> 26:43.560
That is true, Your
Honor, but it's also true

26:43.612 --> 26:45.361
that I regretted signing
them the second I did it.

26:45.397 --> 26:49.232
Look, this whole, horrible mess...

26:49.284 --> 26:51.684
it's made me clear on one thing...

26:51.720 --> 26:55.655
Callie is my daughter and I love her.

26:55.707 --> 26:58.324
And we all...

26:58.326 --> 27:00.410
We believe that Callie belongs with us.

27:00.462 --> 27:02.662
And what do you think, Callie?

27:04.332 --> 27:05.665
Go ahead, tell him.

27:09.404 --> 27:12.096
I think the Adams/Fosters are my family.

27:12.097 --> 27:14.080
And nothing is going to change that.

27:16.394 --> 27:20.330
Well, like all custody
issues, this is a tricky one.

27:20.365 --> 27:23.333
Both sides make compelling arguments:

27:23.368 --> 27:26.236
familiarity, in the case
of the Adams/Fosters,

27:26.288 --> 27:29.289
vs. biology, in the case of the Quinns.

27:29.324 --> 27:32.742
Arguments that, under other circumstances,
would be the definitive winner.

27:33.745 --> 27:36.663
But these are not other circumstances.

27:36.715 --> 27:39.616
So here's what I think we should do...

27:39.651 --> 27:43.303
Let's take the remainder of
the 180-day abandonment period

27:43.338 --> 27:45.588
and make sure we're making the
most informed decision possible.

27:45.590 --> 27:49.592
Until that time, Callie will
remain in her current foster home.

27:49.594 --> 27:54.597
But... I'd also like Callie to
spend one day a week with her father.

27:59.271 --> 28:05.275
Fine. I'll see Robert once a week...

28:07.612 --> 28:12.448
But I won't see anyone else.
I won't go to the house,

28:12.500 --> 28:16.669
I won't see Jill and I won't see Sophia.

28:25.282 --> 28:27.366
You guys, we can't do this without Tia.

28:27.418 --> 28:30.118
Well, I'm not dancing if she is, so...

28:30.120 --> 28:33.922
You guys, it really shouldn't be that
hard. It's really just comparative geometry.

28:36.960 --> 28:42.931
OK, look, OK, we're going from seven people,
an odd formation, to six, an even one.

28:42.966 --> 28:46.385
Anytime we're in three, five, seven
it just becomes two, four, six.

28:46.437 --> 28:48.020
There's never a point person.

28:48.055 --> 28:50.222
So if that's you, you
just give up the middle,

28:50.274 --> 28:55.143
reset so you're equidistant from
your partner and the midpoint.

28:55.195 --> 28:57.979
OK, Anchor Beach, you're up.

29:32.149 --> 29:34.349
Kaitlyn, we're supposed to share...

30:25.452 --> 30:27.235
Come on, Mariana.

31:14.084 --> 31:17.118
Everybody comes up here and talks about

31:17.154 --> 31:23.124
how they hit rock bottom and then started
turning their lives around but not me.

31:23.126 --> 31:29.064
I hit rock bottom, definitely the
time I left my kids on Christmas day

31:29.099 --> 31:33.168
to go get high. Merry Christmas,
kids, Mommy got you some crack.

31:33.203 --> 31:35.437
I mean, who does that?

31:35.472 --> 31:41.026
So, yeah, I hit rock bottom,
stayed there for about a decade,

31:41.061 --> 31:44.062
and then decided I was ready.

31:44.114 --> 31:47.315
So, I think one day at a time,

31:47.317 --> 31:50.368
God willing, things are different now.

31:51.371 --> 31:54.372
God, I hope so.

31:54.408 --> 32:00.362
I just pray that I can do better for
this baby than I did for my twins.

32:01.331 --> 32:02.998
Thank you.

32:14.644 --> 32:17.228
- Go away, Sophia.
- Please, just listen to me.

32:17.230 --> 32:19.447
- No.
- I just wanted to apologize.

32:19.482 --> 32:22.450
I don't care, you've ruined my
life. All right? So leave me alone.

32:22.485 --> 32:26.537
I didn't mean to, Callie. Ok, I'm sorry.

32:26.572 --> 32:29.490
- I am so, so sorry.
- Save it, Sophia. Ok.

32:29.542 --> 32:31.242
There's nothing that you can say
that will make me forgive you.

32:31.244 --> 32:36.580
Don't say that! If you don't
forgive me... I'll kill myself.

32:36.632 --> 32:39.300
- Don't be melodramatic.
- I mean it.

32:39.335 --> 32:41.502
Just go home. I have work to do.

33:09.449 --> 33:13.584
Oh, my God! You were amazing!

33:13.619 --> 33:16.587
Duh! I know!  But thank you.

33:19.292 --> 33:21.292
Oh, be right back.

33:24.297 --> 33:28.432
Don't even talk to me right now.
I stuck my neck out for you and...

33:28.468 --> 33:32.353
- ... and we qualified.
- Yeah. I saw. Congrats.

33:32.388 --> 33:36.190
You're not hearing me. We qualified.

33:36.225 --> 33:38.642
You remember those rules
that Kaitlyn was handing out?

33:38.644 --> 33:41.479
You know, the ones you
made fun of me for taking?

33:41.481 --> 33:45.316
Well, I actually read those,

33:45.368 --> 33:48.318
and it turns out only one
member of the qualifying team

33:48.319 --> 33:50.055
has to be on the competing team at State.

33:50.406 --> 33:54.575
And I qualified. That's why
I didn't walk off with you.

33:54.627 --> 33:58.129
Ok, so...

33:58.164 --> 34:00.498
So, let's start our own dance team.

34:00.500 --> 34:04.168
If I have to listen to Kaitlyn for one
more second, I'm gonna shoot somebody.

34:04.220 --> 34:06.470
Most likely her. And I'm
way too pretty to go to jail.

34:06.506 --> 34:09.389
I can't believe you. God, you
are so sneaky, you know that?

34:09.425 --> 34:12.510
Sometimes I use my powers
for good.  So you in?

34:12.512 --> 34:16.514
- Yes, yeah, abso-freaking-lutely.
- Good.

34:16.565 --> 34:19.233
- All good?
- Oh, yeah.

34:19.268 --> 34:24.271
Ooh, hey, Kaitlyn, guess what? I quit! Bye!

34:30.196 --> 34:31.529
We got in a fight, and I was upset,

34:31.581 --> 34:34.364
so I wasn't looking when
I walked into the street.

34:34.417 --> 34:36.534
I'm so embarrassed...

34:36.585 --> 34:38.335
Well, you need to pay more attention.

34:38.371 --> 34:40.286
Thank God nobody was seriously hurt.

34:40.339 --> 34:43.340
This could have been really terrible
for you and a lot of other people.

34:43.376 --> 34:46.210
All right, I uh... I gave both
the drivers my information,

34:46.262 --> 34:50.214
so, obviously, we're going to pay for
all the damages here, so thank you.

34:50.216 --> 34:53.184
OK, have a good night. Be careful.

34:55.304 --> 35:00.191
And thank you, Callie, for calling us.

35:06.449 --> 35:08.232
It wasn't an accident.

35:09.452 --> 35:10.484
What?

35:14.407 --> 35:15.623
We were having a fight,

35:15.658 --> 35:20.578
and she told me that if I didn't
forgive her she'd kill herself.

35:23.583 --> 35:26.500
I didn't realize it at
the time, but she meant it.

35:26.552 --> 35:28.586
She walked into traffic.

35:32.225 --> 35:34.225
You know it wasn't an accident.

35:36.178 --> 35:37.428
Sophia?

35:39.398 --> 35:42.316
Is that... is that true?

35:49.242 --> 35:50.608
Uh...

35:52.245 --> 35:54.278
Why... ? Why would you...

35:55.448 --> 35:57.498
Sometimes I just wanna die.

35:57.533 --> 35:59.450
What?

36:05.291 --> 36:08.425
I don't really think
I can do this any more.

36:14.600 --> 36:18.218
Come on. Come on, let's get you home.

36:18.271 --> 36:20.354
See you at home.

37:00.346 --> 37:02.313
So what's gonna happen to her?

37:02.348 --> 37:05.482
Well, Robert said they're
gonna get her some help, so...

37:05.518 --> 37:08.185
Oh, thank God.

37:08.237 --> 37:12.439
If any of you is ever feeling like
that, I want you to come talk to us, ok?

37:12.491 --> 37:17.411
And if you don't wanna talk to
us, talk to a sibling, or somebody.

37:17.446 --> 37:21.115
There's always someone who'll
understand, ok. You promise?

37:21.534 --> 37:22.533
Yeah.

37:24.453 --> 37:26.453
Hey, bub, I've got a
plate for you in the oven.

37:26.505 --> 37:29.206
- Thanks.
- No, I got this.

37:29.258 --> 37:30.457
So what was it? Wrestling?

37:30.509 --> 37:32.259
Coach was in a mood, made us stay late.

37:32.294 --> 37:35.346
Hayley was pretty upset that
you weren't there tonight.

37:35.381 --> 37:36.597
Honestly, I was, too.

37:36.632 --> 37:39.550
- It's hot, it's hot...
- How was your performance?

37:39.602 --> 37:42.436
She was amazing. And she
totally saved the show.

37:42.471 --> 37:44.271
Really? I'm sorry I missed it.

37:44.306 --> 37:47.141
Yeah, me too. But we're gonna
see it when they go to State.

37:47.193 --> 37:48.559
- What? You made it?
- Looks like it.

37:48.561 --> 37:50.144
Nice!

37:52.314 --> 37:53.480
Hey, how was your solo?

37:53.532 --> 37:55.566
So, I was, uh, thinking
about this summer...

37:55.618 --> 37:57.317
Mmm-hmm.

37:57.370 --> 38:02.239
And, uh, here's the thing...
the band is gonna go on tour.

38:02.291 --> 38:03.323
Yeah, well, good for the band...

38:04.377 --> 38:06.076
- Mom...
- Brandon, you're 16.

38:06.128 --> 38:09.246
- Seventeen. Almost.
- OK, almost 17.

38:09.248 --> 38:11.440
Do you really want to
spend the summer between

38:11.441 --> 38:12.755
your junior and senior years of high school

38:12.769 --> 38:15.469
playing gigs in dive bars in Albuquerque?

38:15.504 --> 38:17.137
Yes.

38:17.173 --> 38:19.306
Why don't you let us talk
about it for a little while,

38:19.341 --> 38:20.340
it's a big decision.

38:20.393 --> 38:22.176
Ok, all right, yeah.

38:22.228 --> 38:25.262
- As long as you think about it.
- Oh, we'll think about it.

38:25.264 --> 38:26.346
Ok.

38:39.328 --> 38:40.327
Hey...

38:46.452 --> 38:50.337
Are you really serious
about this? The tour?

38:50.372 --> 38:52.206
Yeah.

38:52.258 --> 38:54.374
What about the scholarship?

38:54.427 --> 38:57.461
You're not even gonna
consider going to Idyllwild?

38:57.513 --> 38:59.296
Are you gonna tell Stef and Lena?

38:59.348 --> 39:02.132
No, and I would appreciate
it if you didn't either.

39:02.184 --> 39:04.468
Fine, but your just going to give that up?

39:04.520 --> 39:09.389
Brandon, classical music is...
that's like your one true love.

39:11.277 --> 39:15.479
Well, we don't always get to
have our one true love, do we?

39:21.570 --> 39:23.537
Is it because of Lou?

39:27.293 --> 39:30.327
Is that why you wanna go on tour?
'Cause you're seeing her, right?

39:32.465 --> 39:36.550
It doesn't hurt, sure. But, no,
that's not why I'm going on tour.

39:36.585 --> 39:40.170
I'm going on tour because I think
it would be freaking awesome.

39:54.320 --> 39:56.353
Is Lou why you can't be with me?

39:56.355 --> 39:57.521
- No.
- It's not?

39:57.573 --> 40:00.240
No, you're the reason why
I can't be with you, Callie.

40:01.410 --> 40:03.577
You don't know what you want.

40:03.682 --> 40:06.533
You're just reacting all the time.

40:06.569 --> 40:09.403
And you only ever come to me
when things get hard for you,

40:09.438 --> 40:11.321
or when everything is going wrong.

40:11.357 --> 40:15.676
Do I have feelings for you? Of
course, I have feelings for you.

40:15.711 --> 40:18.378
I'm always gonna have feelings for you.

40:18.414 --> 40:22.449
But I don't... I don't trust you.

40:26.422 --> 40:27.621
Wow.

40:27.623 --> 40:29.456
I didn't mean it in a bad way.

40:29.508 --> 40:31.675
Is there another way to mean it, Brandon?

40:37.683 --> 40:39.516
I'm done.

40:42.388 --> 40:43.470
We're done.

40:48.310 --> 40:49.743
We have to be done.

41:23.479 --> 41:25.420
If you feel desperate or alone,

41:25.421 --> 41:28.615
call the lifeline and talk
with a trained crisis counselor.

41:29.318 --> 41:33.520
Suicide can be prevented, and
help is available day or night.

41:33.555 --> 41:35.489
With help, comes hope.

41:35.524 --> 41:37.691
So call the National
Suicide Prevention Lifeline,

41:37.693 --> 41:40.694
at 1-800-273-TALK.

41:40.746 --> 41:44.498
It's 1-800-273-T-A-L-K.
