00:24.090 --> 00:26.081
Here we go.

00:26.159 --> 00:30.994
- Could you take this for me? Thanks a lot.
- Sure.

00:31.064 --> 00:32.998
Appreciate it.

00:33.066 --> 00:36.900
Giddap! Let's go!
Cracker, come on!

00:38.671 --> 00:40.662
Hyah!

00:48.148 --> 00:51.140
[Children Chattering, Laughing]

00:53.319 --> 00:56.254
[Bell Ringing]

00:56.322 --> 00:58.847
- Come on, children. Recess is over.
- Here we go.

00:58.925 --> 01:01.826
Maddie, Jacob, inside.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.887
[Chattering, Laughing Continue]

01:06.399 --> 01:08.333
[Sobbing]

01:08.401 --> 01:10.335
Emily, what happened?

01:10.403 --> 01:12.701
I fell off the swing
and broke my arm.

01:12.772 --> 01:15.969
- I fell off swings a lot when I was little.
- Did you hurt your arm?

01:16.042 --> 01:18.875
- My arm, my leg, my fingers.
- Twice.

01:18.945 --> 01:20.879
- My nose.
- [Laughs]

01:20.947 --> 01:22.938
- You fell a lot.
- She sure did.

01:23.016 --> 01:25.143
Can you wiggle your fingers?

01:27.454 --> 01:30.719
Know what? You didn't break your arm.
Just bruised it a little.

01:30.790 --> 01:33.054
- Can I go back to school?
- Sure can.

01:33.126 --> 01:35.117
Just wash that up.
Okay?

01:36.629 --> 01:38.563
You are a natural born caretaker, Lindy.

01:38.631 --> 01:41.122
'Cause I can tell a bruise
from a broken bone?

01:41.201 --> 01:44.796
Because you can make people feel better
when they're hurt and scared.

01:44.871 --> 01:46.702
Just like you, Mama.

01:54.814 --> 01:58.045
- Lindy, what brings you into town?
- Came to get my newspapers.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.985
And I thought I'd ask my best fella
to take me to lunch at the hotel.

02:01.054 --> 02:05.047
One of these days somebody else is gonna be
your best fella and I'm gonna get jealous.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.890
There may be another fella in my life someday,
but you'll always be the best papa.

02:08.961 --> 02:12.022
That's worth the best meal
the hotel has to offer.

02:12.098 --> 02:16.933
How'd you get to be so clever
to wrap me around your little finger?

02:17.003 --> 02:20.097
- I hear Dr. Jackson is looking for a new assistant.
- You mean it?

02:20.173 --> 02:23.904
- Absolutely.
- I'd better get there before
somebody else gets the job!

02:23.977 --> 02:26.673
- What about lunch?
- Another time, Papa.

02:29.349 --> 02:31.874
So much for bein' her best fella.

02:42.495 --> 02:45.396
[Sewing Machine Whirring]

02:50.803 --> 02:53.101
- Hey.
- [Gasps] Clark!

02:53.173 --> 02:55.403
You startled me.

02:55.475 --> 02:57.943
- What are these for?
- Nothing in particular.

02:58.011 --> 03:01.105
Maybe I just wanted to give
my beautiful wife some flowers.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.116
Mr. Davis, you do turn my head.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.981
Enough to steal a kiss?

03:06.052 --> 03:07.986
You don't have to steal it.

03:08.054 --> 03:11.251
- Grandma?
- Grandpa!

03:11.324 --> 03:13.383
Did you get all the eggs?

03:13.459 --> 03:16.951
- The reds lay in the barn. Did you check there?
- No.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.498
Stop lollygagging around.
Come on. Get to it.

03:19.566 --> 03:21.557
Yes, sir.

03:22.302 --> 03:23.997
[Laughing]
Clark.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.930
Morning.

03:36.482 --> 03:38.677
Doc Jackson, I'm here
for the assistant position.

03:38.751 --> 03:42.517
Oh, you just hold on there, Belinda.
I can't hire you.

03:42.589 --> 03:44.580
But I know sutures
and basic first aid.

03:44.657 --> 03:47.649
I even learned a new wrapping technique
for sprains that Dr. Usla recommends.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.490
Where'd you learn that?

03:49.562 --> 03:52.326
I read his book. I've read a lot of
medical books and newspaper articles.

03:52.398 --> 03:56.425
- Everything I get my hands on.
- Reading a few books doesn't make you qualified.

03:56.502 --> 03:58.436
Without proper medical training...

03:58.504 --> 04:00.870
all that book knowledge is useless.

04:00.940 --> 04:04.034
But I can learn. I know more
than anyone in Anderson Corner.

04:04.110 --> 04:06.044
Well, I don't doubt it.

04:06.112 --> 04:10.173
But what I need is someone
with solid patient experience.

04:10.250 --> 04:14.186
This is all I've ever wanted to do with my life.
I could learn so much from you, Doc.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.052
Women aren't supposed to be doctors.
What about marriage?

04:17.123 --> 04:19.113
- I'm not gettin' married.
- Ever?

04:19.192 --> 04:23.526
- Well, Doc, I mean...
- Women are meant to marry and have children.

04:23.596 --> 04:27.032
Which is exactly what you'll do
when the right man comes along.

04:27.100 --> 04:30.968
Trust me, marriage and
a career in medicine will never work.

04:31.037 --> 04:32.971
I'm not giving up.

04:33.039 --> 04:36.975
Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell applied to 29 schools
before she got accepted into Geneva College.

04:37.043 --> 04:40.171
Elizabeth Blackwell
is the exception, not the rule.

04:40.246 --> 04:45.047
Now, Geneva College may accept
your application, but I won't. Good day.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.109
Come on.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.263
Whoa.

05:04.937 --> 05:07.872
- Hey.
- Hey, Clark, what can I do for ya?

05:07.940 --> 05:11.068
I just came into town to pick up
some supplies from the general store.

05:11.144 --> 05:16.081
Thought I would stop by to see if the five of you
would like to come out to dinner tonight.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.710
Sounds good. I'm always happy
to eat at your house instead of mine.

05:19.786 --> 05:22.949
- Oh, really?
- Not that Missie's cooking isn't good.

05:23.022 --> 05:25.217
- It's interesting.
- It's all right, Zach.

05:25.291 --> 05:29.387
I love my daughter dearly, but I have to admit
she does not take after her mama...

05:29.462 --> 05:31.726
when it comes to cooking.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.424
Excuse me, Sheriff.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.867
- What can I do for you?
- I'm Drew Simpson.

05:37.937 --> 05:40.929
- My uncle was Hank Simpson.
- Hank was a fine man. My condolences.

05:41.007 --> 05:44.875
- Well, thank you, Mr...
- Davis. Clark Davis.

05:44.944 --> 05:48.471
Our place is next to Hank's.
He was a good neighbor.

05:48.548 --> 05:52.644
Unfortunately I didn't have the opportunity
to meet Uncle Hank, living so far away and all.

05:52.719 --> 05:54.880
- Where you from?
- New York City.

05:54.954 --> 05:57.582
New York City. I'll bet that's
a sight different than our little town.

05:57.657 --> 06:00.490
Oh, yes.
Well, I mean, it's much bigger.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.427
A little bit more cultured
and sophisticated.

06:03.496 --> 06:07.523
This place is clearly rather rustic.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.795
- Rustic.
- [Clears Throat]

06:09.869 --> 06:11.803
Anyway,
the stage driver suggested...

06:11.871 --> 06:14.465
I ask you for directions to my uncle's place.

06:14.540 --> 06:18.067
I can do better than that. Got my buckboard
outside. I'll take you out there myself.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.112
That's awful kind of you, Mr. Davis.

06:20.179 --> 06:21.976
- Sheriff.
- Good day.

06:23.850 --> 06:25.841
- Get up, boys.
- [Horse Whinnies]

06:37.163 --> 06:39.028
Whoa.

06:39.098 --> 06:41.032
Hold these.

06:44.871 --> 06:48.136
Squatters settled in
after your uncle passed.

06:48.207 --> 06:51.608
I'm afraid they didn't
take care of your place properly.

06:51.677 --> 06:54.202
I'd hoped it would be
in good enough shape to sell right away.

06:54.280 --> 06:57.511
- You're not staying.
- Certainly not.

07:08.428 --> 07:11.795
Gonna take a sight of work
to make it presentable.

07:11.864 --> 07:15.800
Pack rats gonna settle into those walls
if you don't get those holes patched up.

07:15.868 --> 07:19.395
- Do you know anyone I could hire to do that?
- You don't want to yourself?

07:19.472 --> 07:21.406
I just graduated from law school.

07:21.474 --> 07:24.409
I know all about writs and torts
and the right of habeas corpus...

07:24.477 --> 07:26.968
but nothing about working on a farm.

07:27.046 --> 07:29.241
- I'd be happy to help you.
- Would you? Thank you.

07:29.315 --> 07:32.682
- I'll pay you, of course.
- That's mighty generous, but no thanks.

07:32.752 --> 07:34.720
I can't let you work for nothing.

07:34.787 --> 07:38.382
You'd be allowing me to
repay a debt to a good friend.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.018
- Then I accept.
- Good.

07:43.062 --> 07:44.996
- [Missie] Please sit down.
- Thank you.

07:45.064 --> 07:47.897
It's great that you could come in today.
I really appreciate it.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.901
- It's no problem.
- Nice to see you.

07:49.969 --> 07:52.904
We haven't had a chance to
talk since you moved here, Mrs. Kent.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.167
Please call me Sadie.

07:55.241 --> 07:57.175
Caleb is a bright boy.

07:57.243 --> 08:01.236
But he's very behind for his age,
especially in reading and writing.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.750
He isn't doing his homework, and he said
that you and his father won't help him with it.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.752
I'm afraid my husband Charles
don't hold much with schoolwork.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.380
I'm sure you understand
the importance of a good education.

08:10.456 --> 08:13.391
I know how bad it feels
when you don't have one.

08:13.459 --> 08:15.393
I only got through
the second grade...

08:15.461 --> 08:18.396
before I had to take care
of the younger kids.

08:19.765 --> 08:22.632
The fact is, I can only read
a few words in this paper.

08:22.702 --> 08:27.605
So it's not that you won't help him,
it's just that you can't.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.766
- What about your husband?
- He can't read at all.

08:29.842 --> 08:32.275
I will spend some
extra time with Caleb.

08:32.345 --> 08:37.044
But with 14 students of different ages
and grades, it's going to be difficult.

08:37.116 --> 08:40.950
Thank you, Mrs. Tyler.
I appreciate anything you can do for him.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.817
L...

08:42.889 --> 08:46.723
You know, Sadie, I could teach you how to read,
and then you could help Caleb to learn.

08:46.792 --> 08:49.556
L-I have to go, Mrs. Tyler.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.501
[Missie]
I should have figured it out.

08:56.569 --> 08:59.504
The Kents have kept to themselves
since they moved into town.

08:59.572 --> 09:01.437
You couldn't have known, Mama.

09:01.507 --> 09:04.442
The signs were all there.
I just missed them.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.444
Hey, Mom. Hey, Sis.
What's for dinner?

09:06.512 --> 09:10.414
Brunswick stew. And it's almost ready,
so you boys go and wash up for supper.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.315
[Groans]

09:16.155 --> 09:18.988
Can we go to Grandma
and Grandpa's for dinner?

09:19.058 --> 09:22.186
Not tonight.
Go do what your mama said.

09:23.329 --> 09:25.263
What does Charles Kent do?

09:25.331 --> 09:29.267
George has hired him part-time at
the general store. He does other odd jobs.

09:29.335 --> 09:31.462
Mostly he wants to
get a farm for himself.

09:31.537 --> 09:34.165
- How did you get all that out of him?
- I asked him.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.140
He doesn't seem very talkative to me.

09:36.208 --> 09:38.642
Well, generally, when the sheriff
asks questions people give answers.

09:38.711 --> 09:40.645
If Mrs. Kent would learn to read...

09:40.713 --> 09:43.648
a whole new world would open up for her,
just like it did for me, Mama.

09:43.716 --> 09:45.479
She'd become a different person.

09:45.551 --> 09:47.280
Maybe that's what
her husband is afraid of.

09:47.353 --> 09:50.015
What kind of woman allows her husband
to dictate to her that way?

09:50.089 --> 09:53.991
I wouldn't know, Lindy.
I haven't had any experience with that kind.

09:54.060 --> 09:55.994
And you never will, Zachary Tyler.

09:56.062 --> 09:58.053
- Oh.
- [Laughs]

10:02.668 --> 10:04.636
Miss.! Hello, Miss.!

10:04.704 --> 10:07.298
- Is there a doctor in town?
- Yes. Are you hurt?

10:07.373 --> 10:11.537
No, not me. My employer, Mrs. Stafford-Smith,
has grown gravely ill.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.910
We were on the stagecoach passing through
when Mrs. Stafford-Smith became ill.

10:14.981 --> 10:18.212
- I fear for her life.
- I didn't think she'd make it, Miss.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.014
- How long has she been like this?
- An hour or so, Miss.

10:24.657 --> 10:26.921
Whoa. Whoa.

10:26.993 --> 10:29.621
Doc, I got a patient for you.

10:35.001 --> 10:37.936
All right, bring her
over here on the table.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.995
Put her right here.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.807
Put her right... That's it.
All right. All right.

10:44.877 --> 10:46.811
Watch her head.

10:46.879 --> 10:48.813
Watch her head.
All right.

10:48.881 --> 10:50.815
Okay.

10:50.883 --> 10:55.286
Her breathing is fine. Pulse is steady.
Her skin's clammy to the touch, Doc.

10:55.354 --> 10:57.219
Mrs. Stafford-Smith
began slurring her words.

10:57.289 --> 10:59.120
Her sentences didn't make sense.
Then she collapsed.

10:59.191 --> 11:01.751
- She been drinking?
- Of course not!

11:01.827 --> 11:06.059
Mrs. Stafford-Smith has
an occasional glass of sherry, but she is a lady.!

11:06.132 --> 11:09.727
- How long y'all been traveling?
- We left Beacon Hill nearly two weeks ago.

11:09.802 --> 11:12.635
- What's she doing out here?
- Visiting friends in Denver.

11:12.705 --> 11:15.640
- The Montgomerys. A very prominent family.
- Do you think she had a stroke?

11:15.708 --> 11:19.075
- Why would you say that?
- I read about the symptoms in Gray's Anatomy.

11:19.145 --> 11:23.241
- Can you help her, Doctor?
- Unfortunately, I have another patient.

11:23.315 --> 11:25.579
Possibly a breach birth.

11:25.651 --> 11:27.585
But you can't leave
Mrs. Stafford-Smith!

11:27.653 --> 11:30.417
Well, there's nothing I can do for her
until she comes to.

11:30.489 --> 11:32.423
And she seems fairly stable.

11:32.491 --> 11:34.823
There's only one of me.

11:34.894 --> 11:39.331
My other patient's situation is urgent,
so just watch out for her until I get back.

11:39.398 --> 11:42.925
- I'll stay, Doc.
- Well, I don't have much choice, do I?

11:43.002 --> 11:45.971
All right, just make sure
she's comfortable...

11:46.038 --> 11:47.972
and keep a close eye on her.

11:48.040 --> 11:51.498
I'll get back as soon as I can.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.193
Mrs. Tyler?

12:08.260 --> 12:11.957
Hi, Sadie.
I just wanted to talk to you about...

12:13.032 --> 12:15.023
- My boy in trouble at school?
- Oh, no.

12:15.101 --> 12:16.864
Nothing like that.

12:16.936 --> 12:19.871
I stopped to bring some books for Mrs. Kent
I thought she might be interested in.

12:19.939 --> 12:21.634
- You ask her for books?
- No.

12:21.707 --> 12:24.540
No, she didn't.
L-I thought that...

12:24.610 --> 12:27.545
Well, you thought wrong.
She got no use for books here.

12:27.613 --> 12:30.309
Now if you got a job you're offering,
that's a different story.

12:30.382 --> 12:32.714
No, I'm afraid not.

12:43.229 --> 12:45.356
Dr. Jackson, she's awake!

12:46.398 --> 12:48.298
H-Heaven's day...

12:48.367 --> 12:50.858
- Get up. Get up.
- [Groaning]

12:50.936 --> 12:54.872
Mrs. Stafford-Smith,
my name is Dr. Jackson...

12:54.940 --> 12:57.875
and I believe you've had a stroke.

12:57.943 --> 13:02.243
My photos... coach... bags...

13:02.314 --> 13:05.875
Calm down. Calm down.
This is not good for you, ma'am.

13:05.951 --> 13:09.250
Have... All that's left...

13:09.321 --> 13:11.152
I have your bag right here.

13:11.223 --> 13:13.885
All your things are inside.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.951
[Sighs]

13:18.130 --> 13:20.223
Her speech
has obviously been impaired.

13:20.299 --> 13:23.393
Well, I don't think it's as bad
as it could have been.

13:23.469 --> 13:26.905
Hopefully the slurring will
diminish pretty quickly...

13:26.972 --> 13:29.406
and she'll regain coherent speech.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.909
There's some paralysis
on her right side...

13:31.977 --> 13:33.911
but her left side seems unaffected.

13:33.979 --> 13:37.346
As soon as she's well enough,
I could help her do some movement therapy.

13:37.416 --> 13:40.351
I read they're having
good results with that.

13:40.419 --> 13:42.853
Well, she will need
someone with her constantly...

13:42.922 --> 13:45.288
till we get a better grasp
of her physical limitations.

13:45.357 --> 13:47.416
I won't leave her side, Doctor.

13:47.493 --> 13:52.260
It should be someone with at least
rudimentary medical knowledge.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.265
[Sighs]
Belinda...

13:54.333 --> 13:56.267
I can do it!

13:56.335 --> 13:59.736
I don't want you to misinterpret this
as a permanent job offer, young lady.

13:59.805 --> 14:03.434
- I haven't changed my mind
about women in medicine.
- So I'd be like your assistant?

14:03.509 --> 14:05.443
Not exactly.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.445
You will help Mrs. Stafford-Smith...

14:07.513 --> 14:09.447
with her movement therapy.

14:09.515 --> 14:12.643
- That is all.
- I accept.

14:29.535 --> 14:32.470
Well, good morning.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.699
Something I can do for you, son?

14:34.773 --> 14:38.300
Uh, well, yes, I've got this problem.

14:38.377 --> 14:42.336
- Mm-hmm.
- A carbuncle that is driving me crazy.

14:42.414 --> 14:46.009
And you see,
the area that's affected...

14:46.085 --> 14:49.213
has been getting a good deal of sitting time,
if you know what I mean.

14:49.288 --> 14:52.951
Oh. You're trying to tell me
you've got a boil on your backside.

14:53.025 --> 14:58.019
Well, bend over the table,
drop your drawers and we'll have a look.

15:05.671 --> 15:11.109
Oh! That is a mean-looking carbuncle
you got there, all right.

15:11.176 --> 15:15.010
Uh, would you bring me
some of that rider's liniment.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.844
It's on the top shelf in there.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.918
Would you stop rubbing!

15:20.051 --> 15:23.953
- I can't help it.
- Well, the more you scratch it, the itchier it gets.

15:24.022 --> 15:25.990
Here you go, Doc.

15:26.057 --> 15:28.525
Oh! Hey, now. Whoa!

15:28.593 --> 15:31.027
- Wait. Never mind.
- Well...

15:31.095 --> 15:34.064
- W-What about your carbuncle?
- What carbuncle?

15:34.132 --> 15:37.727
Well, at least take the liniment.
Belinda.!

15:41.906 --> 15:43.897
Doctor.

15:43.975 --> 15:45.840
[Giggling]

15:45.910 --> 15:49.141
You see, that's another reason
I can't hire a woman.

15:49.213 --> 15:53.411
How am I going to make my money
with you scaring away my patients?

15:59.457 --> 16:01.322
Well, what do you think?

16:01.392 --> 16:03.326
Let me get this straight.

16:03.394 --> 16:06.329
You want to hire Sadie
to help you at school...

16:06.397 --> 16:08.922
so you can teach her to read
without her husband knowing?

16:09.000 --> 16:12.401
- It's an ingenious plan, if you ask me.
- What will you have her do?

16:12.470 --> 16:16.566
Whatever needs to be done. Sweep the floors,
clean blackboards, keep the wood stove burning.

16:16.641 --> 16:20.202
Simple things that allow her to
learn along with the children.

16:20.278 --> 16:23.543
Don't you think the way you're
going about this is just a little sneaky?

16:23.614 --> 16:26.549
I think the Lord
will forgive my methods...

16:26.617 --> 16:30.417
if I can offer this poor woman
a path out of the darkness of ignorance.

16:36.594 --> 16:39.620
Lindy, how long is Doc gonna
let you stay on at the clinic?

16:39.697 --> 16:42.131
As long as Mrs. Stafford-Smith
needs me.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.135
After that Doc says I get the boot.

16:45.203 --> 16:49.537
You will prove yourself so indispensable
that he will never want to let you go.

16:49.607 --> 16:51.598
That's the idea.

16:53.945 --> 16:56.914
Grandma, there's one too many
plates for the table.

16:56.981 --> 16:59.916
We have a guest
joining us for supper.

16:59.984 --> 17:02.612
Come on in, young man.
Let me introduce you.

17:02.687 --> 17:04.621
This is my wife Marty.

17:04.689 --> 17:06.122
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:06.190 --> 17:08.488
- My daughter Missie.
- How do you do?

17:08.559 --> 17:12.426
And this is my granddaughter Belinda.
Lindy, this is Mr. Drew Simpson.

17:12.497 --> 17:15.660
He inherited Hank's place, and he's
come all the way from New York City.

17:15.733 --> 17:18.463
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Simpson.

17:18.536 --> 17:21.130
I trust your journey here hasn't left you
suffering any adverse affects.

17:21.204 --> 17:23.935
Nothing worth speaking of.

17:24.008 --> 17:27.910
- We're all very interested
in hearing about your journey.
- I know I am.

17:27.979 --> 17:30.243
- Yeah.
- We're having a simple dinner.

17:30.314 --> 17:32.680
Fried chicken.
I hope you like it.

17:32.750 --> 17:35.685
Lord, we thank you for the food
that's in front of us...

17:35.753 --> 17:37.687
the family that surrounds us...

17:37.755 --> 17:40.690
and the new friend
that's joined us at our table.

17:40.758 --> 17:42.589
- Amen.
- Amen.

17:42.660 --> 17:45.254
Ah-ah-ah!
Jacob, honey. Guests first.

17:45.329 --> 17:47.263
Would you like a biscuit,
Mr. Simpson?

17:47.331 --> 17:51.597
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry about your uncle.
He was a wonderful man.

17:51.669 --> 17:54.934
Belinda spent quite a bit of time with him
in his last few weeks.

17:55.006 --> 17:58.533
- She nursed him right to the very end.
- That was very kind of you.

17:58.609 --> 18:00.543
Well, Lindy's a natural caretaker.

18:00.611 --> 18:03.478
In fact, she's working
in town with Doc Jackson.

18:03.548 --> 18:06.039
- I hope to be a doctor someday.
- Oh.

18:06.117 --> 18:08.312
That's rather unusual, isn't it?

18:08.386 --> 18:10.581
- Pardon me?
- A woman doctor.

18:10.655 --> 18:13.647
- It doesn't seem quite appropriate.
- Appropriate?

18:13.724 --> 18:18.661
Why would a lady want to subject herself to such
a mentally and physically taxing line of work?

18:18.729 --> 18:20.629
Oh, boy.

18:20.698 --> 18:23.326
I would think being from New York City you
would have a more enlightened view of women.

18:23.401 --> 18:26.336
And by enlightened I assume you mean
a view that agrees with yours.

18:26.404 --> 18:29.498
Ladies are as capable
of practicing medicine as men are.

18:29.574 --> 18:31.974
I could recommend several
newspaper articles for you to read.

18:32.043 --> 18:34.170
That is, if you're open
to being educated.

18:34.245 --> 18:37.180
I think you'll find the majority of men
uncomfortable...

18:37.248 --> 18:40.012
being tended to
by someone of the weaker sex.

18:40.084 --> 18:44.544
That's true. Some men might be so intimidated
that they run away in embarrassment.

18:44.622 --> 18:47.420
I'm just saying that,
like most men...

18:47.492 --> 18:49.824
when I marry
I'll need my wife at home.

18:49.894 --> 18:52.829
She'll have enough to do
just taking care of me and our children.

18:52.897 --> 18:54.922
- I'm sure she will.
- More potatoes, anyone?

18:54.999 --> 18:57.160
- Yes.
- Please.!

19:04.242 --> 19:07.143
You're awake. Good.

19:07.211 --> 19:09.406
How are you feeling,
Mrs. Stafford-Smith?

19:09.480 --> 19:11.277
Tired.

19:15.620 --> 19:17.554
Here.

19:17.622 --> 19:21.456
No!
Don't need help.

19:21.526 --> 19:25.087
- Your speech is better today.
- But not my arm.

19:25.163 --> 19:29.099
With movement therapy it's possible
to regain the use of your arm. Like this.

19:29.167 --> 19:31.101
Don't touch me.

19:31.169 --> 19:33.603
[Footsteps]

19:33.671 --> 19:37.471
You're awake, madam.
This is wonderful!

19:39.143 --> 19:42.738
- Don't fuss over me, Windsor.
- Sorry, madam.

19:42.813 --> 19:45.748
- We should let her get some rest.
- Of course, Miss.

19:45.816 --> 19:49.547
I'll be in the next room, Madam.
I won't leave you.

19:49.620 --> 19:52.054
I know you won't, Windsor.

19:59.397 --> 20:01.331
I'd be at a great disadvantage...

20:01.399 --> 20:04.926
if you hadn't been available
to help me fix up the place, Mr. Davis.

20:05.002 --> 20:07.937
I'd never have got it
good enough to sell.

20:08.005 --> 20:10.269
Glad to do it.

20:10.341 --> 20:13.902
- You be careful now you don't
catch yourself on a rusty...
- Ow!

20:13.978 --> 20:15.912
Wire. Hold on.

20:15.980 --> 20:20.508
- Let me take a look at it. Let me see it.
- Naw, it's nothing.

20:21.919 --> 20:24.251
Yeah, that puncture wound is deep.

20:24.322 --> 20:27.951
I'll tell you, one thing you don't
mess around with is rusty wire.

20:28.025 --> 20:30.118
You'll get a nasty infection.

20:30.194 --> 20:32.685
I want you to go into town,
see the doc.

20:32.763 --> 20:36.756
- I'm fine, really.
- Go on now. You don't mess with rust in a cut.

20:36.834 --> 20:38.768
- I'll finish up here.
- Yes, sir.

20:38.836 --> 20:40.827
All right.

20:42.106 --> 20:44.097
Whoa.

20:51.749 --> 20:53.740
[Clicking Tongue]

21:00.358 --> 21:02.292
[Exhales]

21:05.663 --> 21:07.722
Afternoon, Mr. Simpson.

21:07.798 --> 21:11.962
Good afternoon, Miss Tyler.
I came to see Doctor Jackson about my hand.

21:12.036 --> 21:15.733
He's out checking on patients.
Why? What's wrong?

21:15.806 --> 21:17.740
A little run-in with a rusty wire.

21:17.808 --> 21:20.504
- When do you expect the doc to return?
- Not for hours.

21:21.979 --> 21:23.913
Rusty wire?

21:23.981 --> 21:26.381
Tetanus can take hold pretty quick.

21:26.450 --> 21:29.647
- Might end up losing the hand.
- I think you're exaggerating.

21:29.720 --> 21:32.746
I understand that you're uncomfortable
being tended to by the weaker sex...

21:32.823 --> 21:35.758
but unless we clean that wound immediately
it might be too late.

21:35.826 --> 21:37.760
Lockjaw could set in by tonight.

21:37.828 --> 21:41.264
Although that may
not be the worst thing.

21:41.332 --> 21:43.095
All right.

21:43.167 --> 21:46.102
How much humble pie do I have to eat
to persuade you to help me?

21:46.170 --> 21:51.267
Enough to make me believe you sincerely regret
saying I have no business becoming a doctor.

21:51.342 --> 21:53.742
[Sighs]
I most sincerely regret it.

21:53.811 --> 21:55.745
Come inside.

21:59.750 --> 22:02.617
My grandpa tells me
you went to Columbia University.

22:02.687 --> 22:05.622
You didn't mention that
the other day at dinner.

22:05.690 --> 22:07.624
I guess I could have worked that in...

22:07.692 --> 22:10.627
when you offered to recommend articles
to help enlighten me.

22:10.695 --> 22:12.629
That would have been a good time.

22:12.697 --> 22:15.564
You're so fortunate to have
the opportunity to study at Columbia.

22:15.633 --> 22:19.399
- I suppose that's true.
- I can't be a doctor without the proper education.

22:19.470 --> 22:23.065
Most hospitals won't even consider me
for a nursing position.

22:23.140 --> 22:26.109
The proper education requires
a great deal of money.

22:26.177 --> 22:28.236
I've been saving for a long time.

22:28.312 --> 22:30.974
- [Hisses]
- I'm sorry if it stings.

22:31.048 --> 22:33.312
No, no, it's all right.

22:33.384 --> 22:35.545
Actually, you've been very gentle.

22:39.156 --> 22:41.147
There.
You're all set.

22:42.426 --> 22:44.860
Remember to keep the wound cleaned.

22:44.929 --> 22:49.832
At the risk of bringing up an old argument,
you're a bright and beautiful young woman...

22:49.900 --> 22:51.925
- Beautiful?
- Yes.

22:52.002 --> 22:53.902
[Clears Throat]

22:53.971 --> 22:55.996
Anyway, you'll surely
be married before long.

22:56.073 --> 22:59.941
Why would you want to waste your time
preparing for a career that you'll have to leave?

23:00.010 --> 23:03.878
Why does every man assume
that I'm on a hunt for a husband?

23:03.948 --> 23:07.008
Isn't that the goal?
Find a mate, settle down, have children?

23:07.084 --> 23:10.485
As a lawyer, everything
is black or white to you, isn't it?

23:10.554 --> 23:13.318
Well, that's...
that's rather simplistic.

23:13.391 --> 23:17.691
But there is a clear-cut sense of right and wrong
in the law that I've come to appreciate.

23:17.762 --> 23:19.696
That's why we're different.

23:19.764 --> 23:21.698
I see all of God's colors.

23:21.766 --> 23:25.133
And somewhere between black and white
is my dream to be a doctor.

23:27.605 --> 23:30.472
- I should get back to the ranch.
- Of course.

23:30.541 --> 23:32.532
Please tell my grandpa I said hello.

23:47.625 --> 23:49.559
Those sheets are rough.

23:49.627 --> 23:51.618
They're all I've got.

23:51.695 --> 23:53.890
That cot is like sleeping on a board.

23:53.964 --> 23:58.025
And the draft in here practically
blows the blanket off my legs.

23:58.102 --> 24:00.002
How long until I can leave?

24:00.070 --> 24:04.700
You can move to the hotel today,
Mrs. Stafford-Smith, if Belinda will stay with you.

24:04.775 --> 24:07.972
- Can you do that?
- But I thought I'd continue to work here with you.

24:08.045 --> 24:09.979
Mrs. Stafford-Smith needs a nurse.

24:10.047 --> 24:13.574
- I thought that's what you wanted to be.
- Actually I want to be a doctor.

24:13.651 --> 24:15.642
It's all settled then.

24:26.764 --> 24:28.698
[Missie]
And "decision. '

24:28.766 --> 24:33.897
D-E-C-l-S-l-O-N.

24:33.971 --> 24:36.701
I think that's recess.
You're dismissed.

24:36.774 --> 24:38.708
[Chattering, Laughing]

24:38.776 --> 24:43.076
- You want me to keep an eye on them, Mrs. Tyler?
- Yes. Thank you, Sadie.

24:46.450 --> 24:49.214
- Is everything all right?
- You forgot your lunch today.

24:49.286 --> 24:53.950
Oh, you are so sweet to bring it.
I am starving. Thank you.

24:56.126 --> 25:00.119
Saw Charles Kent this morning.
He told me Sadie really enjoys working here.

25:00.197 --> 25:03.064
She is learning
more and more every day.

25:03.133 --> 25:07.092
She's already ahead of Caleb.
Now she can help him with his work.

25:07.171 --> 25:09.969
I know how much you want to help Sadie,
but Charles is a proud man.

25:10.040 --> 25:12.235
Pride is a man's downfall, Zach.

25:12.309 --> 25:16.643
He won't take it too well if he finds out
she's doing something behind his back.

25:16.714 --> 25:19.444
- I'll see you tonight.
- Bye.

25:24.989 --> 25:28.789
Windsor, is this the best room
the hotel has to offer?

25:28.859 --> 25:31.123
I'm afraid so, Madam.

25:31.195 --> 25:33.823
I suppose it's a step up
from the clinic.

25:33.898 --> 25:37.265
Still, these pillows are much too flat.
They'll never do.

25:37.334 --> 25:40.303
And surely they've got better linen.

25:40.371 --> 25:42.305
Oh!

25:42.373 --> 25:45.740
I'm mortified by these
inferior accommodations.

25:45.809 --> 25:51.179
But I'm afraid it's not possible to get
anything better in this uncivilized outpost.

25:51.248 --> 25:54.012
[Knocking]

25:54.084 --> 25:57.520
Oh, Miss Tyler, please come in.

25:57.588 --> 26:01.115
Madam, I'll just be down in the restaurant
to check on your tea.

26:01.191 --> 26:03.352
Wash the china yourself, Windsor.

26:03.427 --> 26:06.658
I don't trust these people
to have high standards of cleanliness.

26:06.730 --> 26:08.721
Yes, Madam.

26:11.001 --> 26:13.299
How are you feeling today,
Mrs. Stafford-Smith?

26:13.370 --> 26:15.634
How do you think I'm feeling...

26:15.706 --> 26:19.301
being forced to endure
these primitive conditions?

26:19.376 --> 26:21.469
You know,
we're not all uncivilized here.

26:21.545 --> 26:25.504
Really? Did I somehow miss
seeing the opera house?

26:25.583 --> 26:27.517
Or a good library?

26:27.585 --> 26:32.113
Or even a hat shop with
the latest fashions from Europe?

26:32.189 --> 26:35.056
No? I thought not.

26:35.125 --> 26:38.356
- Anderson Corner has other things to offer.
- Such as?

26:38.429 --> 26:41.830
Good people. And a church that
welcomes everybody, including strangers.

26:41.899 --> 26:45.130
And we take care of each other
in difficult times.

26:45.202 --> 26:48.194
You've never even been
outside this small town, have you?

26:48.272 --> 26:52.208
Actually I was born in New York.
I didn't come here until I was 14.

26:52.276 --> 26:55.109
So I do know a few things
about the world outside.

26:55.179 --> 26:57.238
But I much prefer Anderson Corner.

26:57.314 --> 26:59.509
You actually like it here.

26:59.583 --> 27:02.074
Compared to New York
it's heaven on earth.

27:02.152 --> 27:05.087
I'm going to miss it terribly
when I leave to study to be a doctor.

27:05.155 --> 27:08.682
Well, there's a surprising ambition
for a farm girl.

27:08.759 --> 27:12.160
- I believe it's what God called me to do.
- God? Ha!

27:12.229 --> 27:15.824
Don't put your trust in God,
young woman.

27:15.899 --> 27:18.663
He is unconcerned
with your ambitions.

27:18.736 --> 27:21.136
You don't mean that.

27:21.205 --> 27:25.369
The only thing you have
to rely on in this world is yourself.

27:25.442 --> 27:28.036
It must be awful lonely
believing in nothing but myself.

27:28.112 --> 27:31.809
When you've had a little experience
with the harsh realities of life...

27:31.882 --> 27:34.510
you'll abandon that naive faith.

27:34.585 --> 27:38.521
I've had a great deal
of experience of harsh reality.

27:38.589 --> 27:42.081
- Without my faith I expect I'd be much like you.
- How's that?

27:42.159 --> 27:44.423
Very unhappy.

27:44.495 --> 27:46.292
Wha...

27:52.236 --> 27:54.431
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

27:59.276 --> 28:01.642
- Hello.
- Hi.

28:07.685 --> 28:10.848
Drew. I'm so glad
you could join us for supper.

28:10.921 --> 28:12.855
Belinda, I need some eggs, please.

28:12.923 --> 28:14.914
All right, Grandma.

28:16.694 --> 28:18.889
Everyone here works for their supper.

28:26.603 --> 28:29.436
- Might as well spit it out.
- What?

28:29.506 --> 28:32.168
Whatever it is you're stewing over.

28:32.242 --> 28:35.837
I apologize for being
so opinionated and outspoken.

28:35.913 --> 28:38.643
- You probably can't help it.
- Can you?

28:38.716 --> 28:40.911
Not to save my life.

28:40.984 --> 28:43.509
[Chuckles]
Truce?

28:43.587 --> 28:45.680
Truce.

28:45.756 --> 28:47.519
Truce.

28:57.534 --> 29:00.992
Remember, as I'm moving your arm you've got
to imagine you're doing it on your own. Okay?

29:01.071 --> 29:04.507
I saw you reading late
into the night last night.

29:04.575 --> 29:06.839
I'm so sorry.
Did the light keep you awake?

29:06.910 --> 29:08.810
My age keeps me awake.

29:08.879 --> 29:11.814
I'll turn out the light
earlier tonight.

29:11.882 --> 29:15.818
It must have been a very interesting book
to keep you awake at that hour.

29:15.886 --> 29:18.878
Oh, it is. It's called The Laws of Life,
and it's written by...

29:18.956 --> 29:20.719
By Elizabeth Blackwell.

29:20.791 --> 29:23.851
- You know of her?
- I heard her speak in Boston.

29:23.927 --> 29:25.861
She's a very intelligent woman.

29:25.929 --> 29:29.194
I can't imagine what it must be like
to hear her speak in person.

29:29.266 --> 29:31.325
You sound like you greatly admire her.

29:31.401 --> 29:34.802
She's done so much to pave the way
for women to become doctors.

29:34.872 --> 29:37.067
Ah. And that's
what you want to be.

29:37.141 --> 29:41.077
I'll be fortunate if I'm able
to train to be a nurse.

29:41.145 --> 29:44.114
The schooling for doctors
is terribly expensive.

29:51.722 --> 29:55.749
- You moved your arm.
- Your powers of observation are remarkable.

29:55.826 --> 29:58.021
This calls for a cup of tea.

29:58.095 --> 30:01.798
Now, imagine this is
your favorite Earl Grey.

30:01.931 --> 30:03.728
See if you can lift your arm
enough to take it.

30:03.800 --> 30:05.825
What, like a dog doing tricks?

30:05.902 --> 30:07.767
Like a woman who wants
her independence back.

30:07.837 --> 30:10.738
You are a very
impertinent young woman.

30:10.807 --> 30:12.741
And you are a very difficult patient.

30:12.809 --> 30:17.075
If you apply your willfulness
to your therapy, you might get better.

30:25.421 --> 30:28.049
[Sighs]

30:29.458 --> 30:31.358
We'll try again in the morning.

30:36.299 --> 30:38.767
When you're done you can go.

30:45.107 --> 30:48.406
Who is Charles Dickens?

30:48.477 --> 30:51.071
[Chuckles]
A very talented author.

30:51.147 --> 30:53.672
You can borrow the book if you like.

30:53.749 --> 30:56.582
Oh, no, thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow, Mrs. Tyler.

30:56.652 --> 30:58.449
All right.

31:08.998 --> 31:11.228
Hello, boys.
What can I do for you?

31:11.300 --> 31:14.463
- Mom needs some flour.
- All right. What kind?

31:15.571 --> 31:17.436
- She usually has wheat.
- Wheat's good.

31:17.506 --> 31:20.134
All right... Ow!

31:20.209 --> 31:23.906
- You okay, Mr. Browne?
- [Groans Loudly]

31:23.980 --> 31:27.643
- Mr. Browne!
- Dad! Mr. Browne is ill!

31:27.717 --> 31:29.844
[Groaning Continues]

31:31.587 --> 31:33.578
George?

31:34.991 --> 31:36.925
[Groaning Continues]

31:36.993 --> 31:38.927
George needs you
to take a look at him.

31:38.995 --> 31:41.429
He's got a pain.
He can't even stand up straight.

31:41.497 --> 31:44.432
Get him up on the table
and I'll look at him.

31:44.500 --> 31:46.934
[Groaning, Cries Out]

31:47.003 --> 31:48.937
Mm-hmm.

31:49.005 --> 31:52.805
All right, George.
You been vomiting, huh?

31:52.875 --> 31:54.866
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

31:54.944 --> 31:57.811
Well, you don't have a fever.

31:57.880 --> 32:01.145
- You been into the, uh... the candy again?
- Well...

32:01.217 --> 32:02.844
- Yeah, I thought so.
- Aah!

32:02.919 --> 32:05.888
I got to get back to the office.
If you need anything, let me know, Doc.

32:05.955 --> 32:08.719
- All right. Thanks, Zach.
- Bye, Daddy.

32:09.592 --> 32:11.526
Uh...

32:11.594 --> 32:16.156
would you get my watch over there
on the desk, Belinda, and take his pulse.

32:17.533 --> 32:19.364
[Groans]

32:19.435 --> 32:21.960
Checking for rebound tenderness?

32:22.038 --> 32:25.064
Well, if you're so smart,
what am I doing now?

32:25.141 --> 32:27.632
- Using McBurney's point method
to diagnose what's wrong.
- Aah!

32:27.710 --> 32:30.076
- One twenty-five.
- And I suppose you have an opinion?

32:30.146 --> 32:33.673
I think he has acute appendicitis.
He probably needs surgery.

32:33.749 --> 32:35.683
If he has an appendicitis attack...

32:35.751 --> 32:38.219
it's not bad enough
to warrant surgery.

32:38.287 --> 32:40.687
- But if his appendix were to burst, Doctor...
- Burst?

32:40.756 --> 32:42.690
J-J-Just calm down, George.

32:42.758 --> 32:45.693
There's nothing to worry about now.

32:45.761 --> 32:48.286
- You can get up.
- All right.

32:48.364 --> 32:53.700
Look, if you get a fever
or if the pain gets considerably worse...

32:53.769 --> 32:57.296
you come and see me,
even if it's in the middle of the night.

32:57.373 --> 33:01.241
You take a teaspoon of this three times a day
till the pain goes away.

33:01.310 --> 33:04.074
And, George,
you stay out of that candy jar.

33:04.146 --> 33:07.115
- You're a grown man, not a five-year-old.
- Yes, sir.

33:07.183 --> 33:09.276
- All right.
- Much obliged.

33:11.787 --> 33:14.779
[Grumbling]

33:20.730 --> 33:22.925
Now listen here, young lady.

33:22.999 --> 33:27.129
A good doctor never performs
an unnecessary surgery.

33:27.203 --> 33:30.468
It's too risky,
unless the patient will die without it.

33:30.539 --> 33:32.473
But he had all the symptoms.

33:32.541 --> 33:34.873
If he had acute appendicitis...

33:34.944 --> 33:37.811
George would have been
right off this table from the pain.

33:37.880 --> 33:39.814
Might even have passed out.

33:39.882 --> 33:43.545
Probably has nothing worse
than a simple stomachache.

33:53.329 --> 33:55.729
Mama, what's this word?

33:59.835 --> 34:01.393
"Capture."

34:01.470 --> 34:03.131
And this one?

34:03.205 --> 34:04.934
Elephant.

34:05.007 --> 34:08.670
It says, "Then they went out...

34:08.744 --> 34:12.646
to capture the wild elephant."

34:15.150 --> 34:18.313
How do you know
what that says, Sadie?

34:20.022 --> 34:23.321
Mom is learning to read
at school with me, Pa. She's real good.

34:23.391 --> 34:25.985
[Wood Hits Floor]

34:27.163 --> 34:28.994
Charles.

34:41.409 --> 34:46.040
You sure are a lucky man to have a wife
who cooks like Marty does.

34:46.114 --> 34:48.049
I am blessed, that's for sure.

34:48.117 --> 34:52.213
I thank God every day that he saw fit
to put me and Marty together.

34:52.288 --> 34:55.223
- When did you first know you loved her?
- That's easy.

34:55.291 --> 34:58.226
When I thought
I'd never see her again.

34:58.294 --> 35:02.958
I felt a terrible emptiness inside of me.

35:03.032 --> 35:08.868
And I knew that if I didn't get her back,
nothing would ever fill that up again.

35:08.938 --> 35:10.872
That's a pretty clear sign.

35:10.940 --> 35:12.931
I thought so.

35:14.043 --> 35:15.977
What about you, though?

35:16.045 --> 35:19.310
Tell me about that life
you gotta get back to.

35:19.381 --> 35:21.645
- You got a young lady waiting for you?
- No.

35:21.717 --> 35:25.551
My father thought I should concentrate on
school before getting serious about anybody.

35:25.621 --> 35:27.748
- He may be right.
- He's always right.

35:27.823 --> 35:31.259
Sounds like a man
who's pretty sure of himself.

35:31.327 --> 35:34.763
If he's ever had a moment's doubt,
he hasn't admitted it.

35:34.830 --> 35:37.390
- Considers it a weakness, I'll bet.
- Yeah.

35:37.466 --> 35:41.698
He says if someone senses weakness in you,
that's when they go in for the kill.

35:41.770 --> 35:44.204
That's a pretty harsh way
to look at life.

35:44.273 --> 35:47.834
But probably true.
In a legal battle, anyway.

35:54.850 --> 35:57.444
Now, we can both go up on that roof...

35:57.520 --> 36:00.455
and you can find a way
to hurt yourself again...

36:00.523 --> 36:03.515
or you can take the wagon into town,
pick up those supplies we ordered.

36:03.592 --> 36:05.583
That's an easy choice, sir.

36:22.645 --> 36:24.579
Charles?

36:24.647 --> 36:26.444
Yeah?

36:26.515 --> 36:28.415
Heard what happened with your wife.

36:28.484 --> 36:31.317
You mean your wife.
She tricked me.

36:31.387 --> 36:33.321
I'm not apologizing for Missie.

36:33.389 --> 36:35.721
She was acting out of kindness,
and with the honest intent to help.

36:35.791 --> 36:38.589
I don't see how this has anything
to do with you, Sheriff...

36:38.661 --> 36:41.494
unless there's some new law
about reading that I don't know about.

36:41.564 --> 36:44.260
You know, there's no shame
in not being able to read.

36:44.333 --> 36:46.631
The shame is from not even trying.

36:47.570 --> 36:49.299
Good day.

36:59.415 --> 37:02.578
I know it hurts, but that's a good sign.
It means your nerves are kicking back in.

37:02.651 --> 37:05.245
- If you just try a little bit harder...
- I am trying!

37:05.321 --> 37:07.084
You're giving up too easily!

37:07.156 --> 37:10.284
Who do you think you are
to talk to me that way!

37:10.359 --> 37:15.456
An ignorant, low-class girl in
a godforsaken town in the middle of nowhere.

37:15.531 --> 37:19.661
I may not have a college education,
but I'm well-read and definitely not ignorant.

37:19.735 --> 37:23.694
As for class, I come from a good family that
could teach you what that word really means.

37:23.772 --> 37:26.764
- Get out of my sight.
- With pleasure.

37:36.552 --> 37:38.179
Windsor!

37:47.896 --> 37:52.162
Miss Belinda!
Miss Belinda, please! Wait up.

37:52.234 --> 37:55.567
Wait up, Miss Belinda.
Miss Belinda!

37:55.638 --> 37:59.039
I'm sorry, Mr. Windsor. I know you're used
to taking her abuse, but I'm not about to.

37:59.108 --> 38:02.305
Mrs. Stafford-Smith would never
mean to be abusive to you, Miss.

38:02.378 --> 38:06.178
I don't know what you call it back East, but here
we call it rude and unacceptable behavior.

38:06.248 --> 38:10.116
May I share something of
a personal matter with you, Miss Tyler?

38:10.185 --> 38:13.552
There's something
I'd like to show you.

38:13.622 --> 38:17.023
This is Benjamin and Lucy,
Mrs. Stafford-Smith's children.

38:17.092 --> 38:20.357
- I thought she didn't have any children.
- She doesn't now.

38:20.429 --> 38:21.987
Oh, I see.

38:22.064 --> 38:26.000
Mrs. Stafford-Smith became a widower
shortly after Lucy was born.

38:26.068 --> 38:28.866
Her children became everything
in her life, Miss.

38:28.937 --> 38:31.064
What happened to them?

38:31.140 --> 38:33.608
Lucy passed away when
she was five of scarlet fever.

38:33.676 --> 38:37.237
Benjamin drowned just before
he was to graduate from Harvard.

38:37.313 --> 38:39.178
How terrible.

38:39.248 --> 38:41.182
When Mrs. Stafford-Smith lost Lucy...

38:41.250 --> 38:44.378
the only thing that
kept her going was Benjamin.

38:44.453 --> 38:47.547
And when she lost him I was afraid she...

38:47.623 --> 38:49.557
I'm so sorry.

38:49.625 --> 38:53.186
That explains her anger and bitterness,
but that doesn't excuse her behavior.

38:53.262 --> 38:57.460
I just want you to understand that Mrs.
Stafford-Smith was not always the way she is.

38:57.533 --> 39:00.297
She was a kind and generous woman.

39:00.369 --> 39:04.100
Try to think of her the way she was,
before unbearable loss changed her.

39:06.175 --> 39:11.579
Try to see her with a forgiving heart
and not a judgmental mind.

39:28.530 --> 39:30.498
[Knocking]

39:30.566 --> 39:32.557
Come in.

39:35.637 --> 39:38.128
What are you doing back here?

39:39.742 --> 39:42.677
I want to apologize to you,
Mrs. Stafford-Smith.

39:42.745 --> 39:46.044
It was inexcusable for me
to speak to a patient like that...

39:46.115 --> 39:49.243
no matter how challenging you are.

39:49.318 --> 39:53.220
This submissive demeanor
is out of character for you.

39:53.288 --> 39:56.746
Does it have anything to do
with Windsor rushing out after you?

39:56.825 --> 40:00.352
He told me a little bit about your background,
but please do not be angry with him.

40:00.429 --> 40:03.159
He knows better than
to discuss my private life.

40:03.232 --> 40:05.427
He's devoted to you.

40:05.501 --> 40:08.129
The only reason he told me
is because he believes you need me.

40:08.203 --> 40:10.137
I don't need anyone to help me.

40:10.205 --> 40:12.673
We all need someone.

40:14.543 --> 40:17.671
I lost my mother, father
and baby sister.

40:17.746 --> 40:21.182
When I was nine my little brother Jacob and I
had to go live in an orphanage.

40:21.250 --> 40:24.185
- How did you get here?
- An orphan train.

40:24.253 --> 40:28.087
They go from town to town
giving kids to whoever want them.

40:28.157 --> 40:31.126
Sometimes they're good families
and sometimes they're not.

40:31.193 --> 40:34.788
If it wasn't for Missie and Zach,
me and Jacob would be separated forever.

40:34.863 --> 40:37.559
I'm sorry for you, Belinda.

40:37.633 --> 40:40.568
But now you know
why I turned from God.

40:40.636 --> 40:44.800
- No, I don't.
- How can you still have faith?

40:44.873 --> 40:46.807
I know we never really die.

40:46.875 --> 40:50.538
I'm connected to the people I love in life,
and I know we're still connected in death.

40:50.612 --> 40:55.413
A comforting thought if you
can believe in fairy tales, which I can't.

40:58.821 --> 41:01.153
That's enough for today.
You may go.

41:15.671 --> 41:17.662
Whoa.

41:27.649 --> 41:30.777
- Hi!
- Belinda.

41:30.853 --> 41:33.447
I was visiting my grandma
and she wanted me to bring lunch to y'all.

41:33.522 --> 41:37.151
Well, your grandpa went into town to pick up
some lumber. He should be back soon.

41:37.226 --> 41:39.524
I'll just leave this here then.

41:39.595 --> 41:43.531
Uh, wait. Why don't you stay
and visit a while.

41:43.599 --> 41:46.625
I can't. I should be getting
back to the clinic.

41:46.702 --> 41:51.401
Well, I was thinking that maybe, uh,
we could have lunch at the hotel sometime.

41:51.473 --> 41:54.874
- I'd like that.
- Tomorrow?

41:54.943 --> 41:57.878
Well...

41:57.946 --> 42:00.039
sure.

42:13.128 --> 42:16.291
[Horse Whinnies]

42:28.010 --> 42:30.240
- Evening, Charles.
- Evening, Mr. Davis.

42:30.312 --> 42:34.942
Drew Simpson is fixing up his uncle's place.
He could use some help.

42:35.017 --> 42:38.453
He'll pay you a good wage, and I thought
you might be interested in the job.

42:38.520 --> 42:40.613
- Can I work around my hours at the store?
- You bet.

42:40.689 --> 42:43.180
All right then.
I'll be there right after lunch.

42:43.258 --> 42:45.590
- I'll see you then.
- All right.

42:45.661 --> 42:47.822
Mr. Davis.

42:47.896 --> 42:50.490
Thank you, sir.
I really appreciate the work.

42:50.566 --> 42:53.034
You're welcome, Charles.
You're welcome.

43:08.450 --> 43:10.441
Thank you.

43:11.520 --> 43:13.511
[Groans]

43:15.424 --> 43:18.951
I envy you your faith, Belinda,
but I can't share it.

43:19.027 --> 43:21.962
And even if I could,
it doesn't change the fact...

43:22.030 --> 43:24.965
that the only reason I didn't
let that stroke kill me...

43:25.033 --> 43:28.469
is my distant relatives
who are just waiting for me to die...

43:28.537 --> 43:31.005
so that they can inherit my fortune.

43:31.073 --> 43:35.737
I think the whole reason your stroke
didn't kill you is 'cause God has work for you.

43:35.811 --> 43:39.212
- You find a purpose by loving other people.
- And losing them.

43:39.281 --> 43:42.944
The fact that you grieve deeply
means you love deeply.

43:43.018 --> 43:46.818
There are so many people out there
who need what you have.

43:46.888 --> 43:49.618
- Who would that be?
- At the orphanage...

43:49.691 --> 43:54.321
there's hundreds of children without parents
or parents who simply give them away.

43:54.396 --> 43:57.024
Ah, so you're suggesting I give money.

43:57.099 --> 43:59.499
Not just money.
Yourself.

43:59.568 --> 44:02.901
You have so much love to give
and they need love.

44:07.109 --> 44:09.373
Aren't we supposed to be practicing?

44:11.346 --> 44:14.611
Reach for the teacup.

44:14.683 --> 44:16.548
One hand.

44:28.764 --> 44:30.994
[Gasps]

44:42.110 --> 44:44.635
Best cup of tea I ever had.

44:49.418 --> 44:52.251
- [Charles] Hold it right there.
- Okay.

44:54.489 --> 44:56.423
- That'll do it.
- [Chuckles]

44:56.491 --> 45:00.120
Thanks again, Charles. I'm not sure
what I would have done without you.

45:00.195 --> 45:02.493
You're more than welcome,
Mr. Simpson.

45:02.564 --> 45:04.498
Drew.

45:04.566 --> 45:06.557
All right. Drew.

45:08.070 --> 45:11.597
May I ask you a question?
About the law?

45:11.673 --> 45:13.607
Sure.

45:13.675 --> 45:15.609
It's about adoption.

45:15.677 --> 45:18.604
You and your wife
thinking about adopting a child?

45:18.680 --> 45:22.980
Well, not exactly.
Sadie was married before we met.

45:23.051 --> 45:26.782
And her first husband,
he was Caleb's pa.

45:26.855 --> 45:28.789
But he was a real no-account.

45:28.857 --> 45:32.258
He used to beat Sadie and Caleb both.

45:32.327 --> 45:34.352
- She divorce him?
- Yeah.

45:34.429 --> 45:39.264
He got in a bar fight and he hurt some fella
real bad, and they put him prison.

45:39.334 --> 45:43.361
Gave Sadie a chance to get away,
but he's fixing to get out soon.

45:43.438 --> 45:47.238
And I know he's gonna
come looking for Caleb.

45:47.309 --> 45:50.710
Now, if I can adopt him...

45:50.779 --> 45:53.805
does that make him my boy,
and then ain't nobody can take him away?

45:53.882 --> 45:56.908
That's right.

45:56.985 --> 46:00.443
Sadie's awful worried that
he won't give up his claim to Caleb.

46:00.522 --> 46:05.289
Well, under normal circumstances,
he'd have to agree to it.

46:05.360 --> 46:07.624
But because he's been in prison...

46:07.696 --> 46:10.756
there's no way the court
would favor him over you.

46:10.832 --> 46:14.324
- You sure about that?
- Well, I'll draw up the papers to petition the court.

46:14.402 --> 46:16.336
We'll see what the judge has to say.

46:16.404 --> 46:20.500
- Well, now, I can't pay you right now, but...
- You don't have to.

46:20.575 --> 46:25.706
- Well, I don't take charity.
- Consider it part of your wages for working here.

46:25.780 --> 46:28.840
Like a... a bonus
for doing a really good job.

46:28.917 --> 46:32.148
All right.

46:32.220 --> 46:36.213
- Thank you, Drew.
- It's my pleasure, Charles.

46:36.291 --> 46:38.657
I just passed the bar.

46:38.727 --> 46:43.892
- When I return home,
I'll join my father's practice.
- Does he practice criminal law?

46:43.965 --> 46:46.490
Nothing nearly so unsavory.

46:46.568 --> 46:50.231
No, he handles mostly contracts,
wills, trusts, that sort of thing.

46:50.305 --> 46:53.706
My father represents some
of the wealthiest people in New York.

46:53.775 --> 46:55.766
So you'll only be helping the rich people.

46:55.844 --> 46:59.837
- That's who our clients are.
- They don't have to be.
You could help the less fortunate.

46:59.914 --> 47:01.905
We work with people
who pay our fees.

47:01.983 --> 47:04.508
- Is that all you care about... money?
- [Chuckles]

47:04.586 --> 47:06.577
Don't be ridiculous.
That's not what I meant.

47:06.655 --> 47:09.681
It seems to me you don't
have a real passion for law.

47:09.758 --> 47:14.252
Well, the definition of law
is reason free from passion.

47:15.864 --> 47:18.094
Do you have time to take a walk?

47:18.166 --> 47:21.363
- I should be getting back to Mrs. Stafford-Smith.
- A short one?

47:33.481 --> 47:37.281
So, do you really want to be a lawyer,
or was it simply expected of you?

47:37.352 --> 47:40.913
It was always understood that I would
follow in my father's footsteps, yes.

47:40.989 --> 47:44.356
What does your mother think?
Or doesn't her opinion matter?

47:44.426 --> 47:47.691
Oh, her opinion would matter
a great deal if she were still alive.

47:47.762 --> 47:52.256
- She died when I was eight.
- Oh, I had no idea. I'm so sorry, Drew.

47:52.333 --> 47:54.267
You know,
for a long time after she died...

47:54.335 --> 47:56.997
I used to play this little game
every time I left the house.

47:57.072 --> 48:00.337
I'd pretend that when I came home,
she'd be there...

48:00.408 --> 48:03.070
hidin' somewhere waiting
for me to find her. [Chuckles]

48:03.144 --> 48:07.240
Of course the only thing I ever found was
the latest governess my father had hired.

48:07.315 --> 48:12.514
He gave me every material advantage
I could ever hope for.

48:12.587 --> 48:16.284
The only thing I ever wanted was my mother
to be there when I came home.

48:16.357 --> 48:19.793
- You're privileged to have both your parents.
- Actually, I was adopted.

48:19.861 --> 48:23.422
I would have never guessed
they're not really your family.

48:23.498 --> 48:26.524
- I mean, not that...
- [Laughs] It's all right.

48:26.601 --> 48:29.434
At first I didn't feel like
they were my family.

48:29.504 --> 48:33.235
They made me realize that loving someone
has nothing to do with being related...

48:33.308 --> 48:35.776
and everything to do with opening your heart
and letting someone in.

48:35.844 --> 48:38.608
I envy the relationship
you have with your family.

48:38.680 --> 48:41.877
- Why?
- You really love each other.

48:41.950 --> 48:44.748
I haven't felt that
since my mother died.

48:44.819 --> 48:47.982
That sense of security of knowing...

48:48.056 --> 48:51.116
Knowing that someone'll
always be there for you.

48:51.192 --> 48:54.320
You'll never be completely
on your own again.

48:54.395 --> 48:56.386
Yes.

48:57.766 --> 49:00.132
Exactly.

49:07.342 --> 49:09.572
You see?
[Chuckles]

49:09.644 --> 49:12.943
[Chuckles]
My, my, my...

49:13.014 --> 49:17.246
you have made remarkable progress,
Mrs. Stafford-Smith.

49:17.318 --> 49:20.014
I must say, I am very impressed.

49:20.088 --> 49:25.025
To be truthful, I wasn't sure
you'd regain use of your arm.

49:25.093 --> 49:29.223
Nor did I think so, but Belinda
was stubborn about my therapy.

49:29.297 --> 49:32.266
She listened to me
grouse and complain...

49:32.333 --> 49:34.767
but she never gave up on me.

49:34.836 --> 49:38.397
She's a remarkable young woman,
don't you think, Doctor?

49:38.473 --> 49:42.239
Yes.
Yes, she is, indeed.

49:42.310 --> 49:44.210
Remarkable.
[Chuckles]

49:44.279 --> 49:46.975
I know you must be anxious
to get back to Boston...

49:47.048 --> 49:50.381
and I think you can start
planning to go home now.

49:50.451 --> 49:54.080
Oh, thank you, Doctor.

49:56.124 --> 49:59.560
So, what did you ride all the way out here
to ask your grandma?

49:59.627 --> 50:03.290
It seems while I wasn't looking,
my life just got really complicated.

50:03.364 --> 50:06.595
This wouldn't have anything
to do with Drew Simpson, would it?

50:06.668 --> 50:09.193
I'm attracted to him and it's not fair.

50:09.270 --> 50:11.602
- To you or to him?
- Both.

50:11.673 --> 50:14.267
He's becoming a distraction.
I can't let that happen.

50:14.342 --> 50:18.108
Everything seems to be getting
a lot harder all of a sudden.

50:18.179 --> 50:21.546
Only a few years ago I knew
just how to get answers to my questions.

50:21.616 --> 50:24.278
You wish it was simple again
like when you were a child?

50:24.352 --> 50:27.753
You could say a heartfelt prayer to God
and then just listen for his guidance.

50:27.822 --> 50:30.052
Yes.

50:30.124 --> 50:33.059
Belinda, it's still that simple.

50:41.970 --> 50:43.904
Drew, you wanna take a break?

50:43.972 --> 50:47.806
What? Oh, no, no, no, I'm fine.
[Chuckles]

50:52.213 --> 50:55.307
- Somethin' weighin' on your mind?
- No, nothing.

50:57.151 --> 51:01.417
Have you ever had that experience
where you think a person is one way...

51:01.489 --> 51:03.354
and they turn out
to be something else entirely?

51:03.424 --> 51:05.858
I think we've all had that experience
at one time...

51:05.927 --> 51:08.828
I had Belinda all figured out.
Then I get thrown for a loop.

51:08.897 --> 51:14.164
- And that's bad?
- Well, it's... complicated.

51:14.235 --> 51:17.762
- She makes me think about things
I thought were all settled.
- Such as?

51:17.839 --> 51:20.034
Where I'm going to live,
what I'm going to do.

51:20.108 --> 51:23.134
Even whether or not my life
has any real meaning or purpose.

51:23.211 --> 51:26.612
Well, a woman can do that to a man.

51:26.681 --> 51:29.377
I know what I want to do with my life.

51:29.450 --> 51:32.112
I want to sell this place,
go back to New York...

51:32.186 --> 51:34.848
go into my father's firm,
get married, and raise a family.

51:34.923 --> 51:39.087
- Well, in that case, what is the problem?
- Belinda is the problem.

51:39.160 --> 51:41.924
I don't want to think about her.
I don't want to get involved with her.

51:41.996 --> 51:45.090
She's nothing like the kind of woman
I have planned for my future.

51:45.166 --> 51:48.499
She wants a career...
in a man's field.!

51:48.569 --> 51:51.299
She's opinionated...

51:51.372 --> 51:53.897
outspoken, strong-willed...

51:55.009 --> 51:57.307
smart, kind.

51:57.378 --> 52:00.745
That doesn't sound like a problem, son.
That sounds like an opportunity.

52:05.286 --> 52:07.277
Whoa.

52:22.837 --> 52:25.670
Oh, it's not your hand again.

52:25.740 --> 52:28.174
It's my finger.
I think it's broken.

52:28.242 --> 52:32.406
[Exhales] There ought to be
a law against giving you a hammer, son.

52:34.282 --> 52:38.742
For your information, the first time
I hurt myself, it was on a wire.

52:38.820 --> 52:43.280
Maybe you should stick
to lawyering. Hmm.

52:46.160 --> 52:50.927
Belinda, why don't you, uh,
look at the boy's hand.

52:56.738 --> 52:58.706
Can you bend it?

53:00.375 --> 53:02.366
I guess I can.

53:04.345 --> 53:07.610
I think it's just a bruise.
I could splint it if it's broken.

53:07.682 --> 53:10.310
It might be quite cumbersome.

53:10.385 --> 53:13.183
Just leave it.

53:13.254 --> 53:16.690
Have lunch at the hotel
with me today.

53:16.758 --> 53:19.056
- I'm sorry. I can't.
- Tomorrow then?

53:19.127 --> 53:21.220
I have Mrs. Stafford-Smith to tend to.

53:23.164 --> 53:25.564
- Well, maybe we could find time...
- Do you want the splint?

53:25.633 --> 53:30.502
What? No. No splint.

53:30.571 --> 53:33.734
Then excuse me.
I have work to finish.

54:03.905 --> 54:05.702
Belinda, wait.

54:05.773 --> 54:08.333
I have to get home, Drew.
I have things to do.

54:08.409 --> 54:10.934
Why are you being like this?
What happened?

54:11.012 --> 54:13.207
- I don't know what you mean.
- Yes, you do.

54:13.281 --> 54:16.444
When the farm sells,
you'll be moving back to New York, right?

54:16.517 --> 54:18.644
Well, yes.

54:18.719 --> 54:22.120
And I'll be staying here.
So where does that leave us?

54:22.190 --> 54:27.093
You'll go back to a life
I can barely imagine.

54:27.161 --> 54:29.459
Meeting with rich clients
in a big office...

54:29.530 --> 54:32.055
going to fancy balls with orchestras...

54:32.133 --> 54:36.263
dancing with well-bred girls
in satin gowns.

54:36.337 --> 54:38.703
After a while,
you won't even remember me.

54:40.475 --> 54:43.342
Hand me that, please.

54:50.852 --> 54:53.343
- Come on, Drifter.
- [Neighs]

55:01.262 --> 55:04.823
[Knocking]

55:04.899 --> 55:07.959
Well, let's see who that is.

55:08.035 --> 55:12.062
- Hey, Charles.
- Evening, Sheriff. Awful sorry
to interrupt your family meal.

55:12.140 --> 55:14.165
Would you like to join us, Charles?

55:14.242 --> 55:19.270
Oh, no, thank you, ma'am. I just came
to drop this by. It's for Miss Belinda.

55:25.319 --> 55:28.288
It seems Drew hurt himself again.

55:28.356 --> 55:32.725
I better go check on him.
I'll be back as soon as I can, Mama.

55:33.828 --> 55:36.353
- Thank you, Charles.
- Sheriff.

55:36.430 --> 55:39.365
[Hoof beats Pounding]

55:56.184 --> 55:58.175
Drew?

56:05.126 --> 56:08.391
What?

56:08.462 --> 56:11.556
- I believe this belonged to my aunt.
- [Music][music] [Music Box]

56:11.632 --> 56:15.124
Probably meant
a great deal to my uncle.

56:16.504 --> 56:19.064
[Sighs]
This isn't a fancy ballroom.

56:19.140 --> 56:21.233
There isn't an orchestra.

56:23.477 --> 56:26.469
[Music](music)[music](music)[Continues]

56:28.749 --> 56:30.774
But if I can have this dance...

56:30.851 --> 56:33.752
I promise you, Belinda,
that I will never forget it.

57:11.959 --> 57:14.553
You know this doesn't
change anything, Drew.

57:14.629 --> 57:18.725
- I think it changes everything.
- I should go in.

57:18.799 --> 57:20.664
I'll see you tomorrow.

57:21.802 --> 57:23.793
- I don't think...
- Tomorrow.

57:28.976 --> 57:30.910
[Man]
Hyah!

57:30.978 --> 57:34.937
Dr. Jackson has given me the go-ahead
to travel home to Boston.

57:35.016 --> 57:39.316
I'm very happy for you, Mrs. Stafford-Smith,
but I am gonna miss you.

57:39.387 --> 57:41.378
I'd like you to come with me, Belinda.

57:41.455 --> 57:44.219
If you're worried about
the travel, Mister...

57:44.292 --> 57:47.159
No, I'm not looking
for a traveling companion.

57:47.228 --> 57:49.662
I'd like you to come back
to Boston and live with me.

57:49.730 --> 57:53.257
Take me to that orphanage.
I'd like to meet those children.

57:53.334 --> 57:56.895
You don't need me to take you there.
I'll just get you the name of the orphanage.

57:56.971 --> 57:58.905
No.
Well, Belinda, there's more.

57:58.973 --> 58:02.340
I would like to pay your way
through college and medical school.

58:02.410 --> 58:06.870
You shouldn't have to settle
for small dreams.

58:06.947 --> 58:11.441
Dare to go for the big ones.!
You'll make a fine doctor, Belinda.

58:11.519 --> 58:14.920
That's a much too generous offer,
Mrs. Stafford-Smith.

58:14.989 --> 58:17.719
I'm afraid I can't accept it.

58:17.792 --> 58:22.195
- Why on earth not?
- Because it would take me years
and years to pay you back.

58:22.263 --> 58:25.130
Well, it's not a loan, it's a gift.

58:25.199 --> 58:29.260
I'm a very wealthy woman.
I can afford to do this for you.

58:29.337 --> 58:34.604
I would like to think,
if my Lucy had lived...

58:34.675 --> 58:37.200
she might have grown up
to be just like you, Belinda.

58:37.278 --> 58:43.012
Even if I could accept your offer,
they'd never accept me into a good college.

58:43.084 --> 58:45.484
Most of the schools
don't even allow women.

58:45.553 --> 58:50.547
Oh, posh! I'll just send up a smoke signal
to my friend Sam Gregory.

58:50.624 --> 58:53.889
Dr. Samuel Gregory?
The Dr. Samuel Gregory...

58:53.961 --> 58:56.429
who founded Boston University
School of Medicine?

58:56.497 --> 58:58.590
Yes. One and the same.

58:58.666 --> 59:01.601
I don't know what to say.

59:01.669 --> 59:04.570
Well, say yes!

59:04.638 --> 59:09.268
Thank you, Mrs. Stafford-Smith.
Thank you!

59:09.343 --> 59:15.282
Now I know that you'll need to
talk this over with your family.

59:15.349 --> 59:17.817
But when I leave next week...

59:17.885 --> 59:20.217
I hope you'll be with me.

59:25.159 --> 59:27.150
[Sighs]

59:29.497 --> 59:34.434
I think it is the opportunity
of a lifetime, Lindy.

59:34.502 --> 59:39.439
But Boston is very far away.
And we'd certainly miss you.

59:39.507 --> 59:43.944
And I'm gonna miss you and Papa and Grandpa
and Maddie and Jacob.

59:44.011 --> 59:47.469
- I can't leave Jacob.
- We'll take good care of him.

59:47.548 --> 59:50.415
Besides, we all knew you were going to
have to leave Anderson Corner one day...

59:50.484 --> 59:52.475
if you were going to get
a good education.

59:52.553 --> 59:54.987
It scares me about thinking
of leaving everyone.

59:55.055 --> 59:58.456
When I came out here from back East,
I was scared too.

59:58.526 --> 01:00:03.759
So was I. When I left with my first husband
Willie, I had no idea what lay ahead.

01:00:03.831 --> 01:00:06.800
The only thing I knew was that
I was leaving the only home I'd ever known.

01:00:06.867 --> 01:00:11.104
How'd you both do it?

01:00:11.237 --> 01:00:14.536
When you face the unknown, you have to
gather every ounce of courage you possess.

01:00:14.607 --> 01:00:19.169
Then tell yourself if it's the right thing to do,
everything will work out fine.

01:00:19.245 --> 01:00:21.679
And if it doesn't,
you can always come home.

01:00:21.747 --> 01:00:25.740
- So you think I should go?
- I think you should do what
your mama and I both did.

01:00:25.818 --> 01:00:28.480
Pray about it.
And then decide.

01:00:42.735 --> 01:00:45.863
Belinda.
What a wonderful surprise.

01:00:45.938 --> 01:00:47.929
I can only stay a moment, Drew.

01:00:48.007 --> 01:00:50.840
Something entirely unexpected's
happened and I wanted to let you know.

01:00:50.910 --> 01:00:54.038
- I hope it's something good.
- Actually, it's amazing.

01:00:54.113 --> 01:00:58.447
Mrs. Stafford-Smith has asked me to go to Boston
with her. She's gonna put me through school.

01:00:58.518 --> 01:01:02.352
That's incredible.
I know what it must mean to you.

01:01:02.421 --> 01:01:04.446
You know, Boston isn't that far
from New York. Maybe we could...

01:01:04.524 --> 01:01:06.719
That's just it, Drew.

01:01:06.792 --> 01:01:08.555
- No, we can't.
- Why not?

01:01:08.628 --> 01:01:11.722
As soon as I get my medical degree,
I'll be coming back here...

01:01:11.797 --> 01:01:14.027
practicing with Doc and hopefully
taking over for him someday.

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:17.831
You may change your mind when you get
to Boston. It has a great deal to offer.

01:01:17.904 --> 01:01:22.967
It doesn't have what Anderson Corner does:
My family, people who really need me.

01:01:23.042 --> 01:01:26.205
- They probably won't have
a doctor when Doc's gone.
- Belinda, we can work this out.

01:01:26.279 --> 01:01:29.077
I've thought hard about this, Drew.
I've prayed even harder.

01:01:29.148 --> 01:01:33.084
I would never fit into your world.
My life is here.

01:01:33.152 --> 01:01:35.985
The only way we could be together is
if one of us is miserable.

01:01:36.055 --> 01:01:38.615
- Belinda.
- I said what I came here to say.

01:01:39.725 --> 01:01:42.216
Belinda.

01:01:42.295 --> 01:01:44.229
Belinda!

01:01:51.904 --> 01:01:54.498
[Door Opens]

01:02:02.481 --> 01:02:05.314
- Who is it?
- Jonas Barnes.

01:02:05.384 --> 01:02:08.285
He hurt his leg recently.
Gangrene set in.

01:02:08.354 --> 01:02:11.619
- It's gonna have to come off at the knee.
- Will surgery save his life?

01:02:11.691 --> 01:02:16.355
With gangrene... [Sighs]
I don't know.

01:02:16.429 --> 01:02:19.921
But if I don't do it,
he'll die within the day.

01:02:23.102 --> 01:02:24.865
I can help.

01:02:24.937 --> 01:02:27.201
Belinda...

01:02:27.273 --> 01:02:31.437
this is life-threatening,
gruesome surgery.

01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:34.809
- I can handle it, Doc.
- [Sighs]

01:02:46.525 --> 01:02:50.461
Cora, I need you to wait outside.
I'll come get you as soon as we're done.

01:03:01.741 --> 01:03:05.700
All right, Jonas.
I think we're ready to start.

01:03:05.778 --> 01:03:08.338
Maybe you could say
a little prayer first.

01:03:08.414 --> 01:03:12.180
Of course.
Uh, Belinda.

01:03:12.251 --> 01:03:16.017
Lord, we are eternally grateful
that you are here with us now.

01:03:16.088 --> 01:03:18.989
And pray that you bless Doc
with a steady hand...

01:03:19.058 --> 01:03:21.754
and bless Jonas
with a peaceful heart...

01:03:21.827 --> 01:03:26.196
and Cora with the knowledge
that you are in control of this day.

01:03:26.265 --> 01:03:28.324
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:03:28.401 --> 01:03:32.428
- Amen.
- All right, I need you to lay back there now.

01:03:32.505 --> 01:03:35.167
Everything's gonna be all right.
Belinda.

01:03:36.742 --> 01:03:38.869
- Count to 10 with me, okay?
- Okay.

01:03:38.944 --> 01:03:40.172
- One...

01:03:47.853 --> 01:03:50.515
six, seven, eight...

01:03:52.858 --> 01:03:54.792
- All right.
- He's out.

01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:58.557
Okay. All right.

01:04:03.769 --> 01:04:06.033
[Gags]

01:04:21.187 --> 01:04:23.178
All right.

01:04:24.190 --> 01:04:26.988
[Flesh Slicing]

01:04:46.512 --> 01:04:49.970
This starts the process
to make you legally Caleb's father.

01:04:50.049 --> 01:04:53.143
I'll just need you to sign there,
and then I'll file the paper with the court.

01:04:53.219 --> 01:04:55.187
You really think the judge
will grant the adoption?

01:04:55.254 --> 01:04:59.213
I can't guarantee it,
but it should be an open-and-shut case.

01:05:09.769 --> 01:05:12.966
- Your turn, Charles.
- Can I sign for Charles?

01:05:13.038 --> 01:05:16.166
I'm afraid not. You just
put your "X" right there.

01:05:24.049 --> 01:05:26.040
Very good.

01:05:29.221 --> 01:05:32.122
You know, you're my first client.

01:05:32.191 --> 01:05:34.716
Now if you'll excuse me,
I need to be going.

01:05:34.794 --> 01:05:37.524
Thank you so much, Drew.
I really appreciate it.

01:05:37.596 --> 01:05:39.962
You're more than welcome.

01:05:45.538 --> 01:05:47.529
Thank you, Sadie.

01:05:52.978 --> 01:05:58.382
Charles, we haven't talked about what
happened with Caleb. L... I want to explain.

01:05:58.451 --> 01:06:00.510
No, you don't have to, Sadie.

01:06:00.586 --> 01:06:02.884
I'm sorry I went behind your back.

01:06:02.955 --> 01:06:06.391
But I don't understand
why you don't want me to learn to read.

01:06:06.459 --> 01:06:10.088
I reckon if you learned how to read,
you'd see that there's...

01:06:10.162 --> 01:06:14.531
a whole lot more out there
than what I can give you and Caleb.

01:06:15.768 --> 01:06:20.899
Charles, you are the finest man
I've ever known.

01:06:20.973 --> 01:06:23.441
I don't know what Caleb
and I would have done without you.

01:06:23.509 --> 01:06:27.036
Oh, Sadie, I love you both so much.

01:06:27.112 --> 01:06:30.411
And I'd be mighty proud
to give Caleb my name.

01:06:30.483 --> 01:06:33.509
But l... I wonder if he's
gonna be ashamed of me.

01:06:33.586 --> 01:06:37.579
You know what would make
your son proud of you, Charles?

01:06:37.656 --> 01:06:41.387
Seein' that his father had the courage
to do something very hard...

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:44.190
all because he loves his son so much.

01:06:44.263 --> 01:06:46.493
[Sighs]
If I can do it...

01:06:46.565 --> 01:06:49.363
I know you can, Charles.

01:06:51.837 --> 01:06:56.297
Sure would be nice to be able to read
that piece of paper that says I'm Caleb's pa.

01:06:58.844 --> 01:07:01.836
Think she might teach us together?

01:07:02.848 --> 01:07:05.612
[Both Laugh]

01:07:13.125 --> 01:07:15.992
Hmm? What happened?

01:07:16.061 --> 01:07:18.894
Cora. Cora.

01:07:18.964 --> 01:07:21.262
- You mustn't move, Mr. Barnes.
- Cora.

01:07:21.333 --> 01:07:23.961
- [Grunting]
- Mr. Barnes. Mr. Barnes.

01:07:24.036 --> 01:07:25.503
Cora!

01:07:27.006 --> 01:07:29.907
- [Screams]
- Mr. Barnes!

01:07:29.975 --> 01:07:33.672
Oh, dear God.
Come here.

- [Moans]
- [Grunting]

01:07:36.315 --> 01:07:39.512
- What happened?
- He got scared. He started asking for Cora.

01:07:39.585 --> 01:07:42.611
- I tried to stop him, Doc. I'm so sorry!
- It's all right.

01:07:42.688 --> 01:07:46.749
Go get some bandages.
Hurry. Hurry!

01:07:46.825 --> 01:07:50.352
All right, Jonas, we're gonna
get you back into bed now. Okay?

01:07:50.429 --> 01:07:53.865
- Help me if you can.
- [Moans]

01:07:53.933 --> 01:07:56.731
All right. All right.
Just calm down now.

01:07:56.802 --> 01:07:59.532
- [Panting]
- Just calm down. Calm down.

01:07:59.605 --> 01:08:01.664
It's gonna be all right.

01:08:01.740 --> 01:08:05.267
- Jonas, it's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.
- [Panting]

01:08:05.344 --> 01:08:08.313
Listen to me, Jonas.
You have to relax. Jonas!

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:11.838
Shh, shh. All right. Shh.

01:08:11.917 --> 01:08:14.317
You have to relax.

01:08:14.386 --> 01:08:16.877
Jonas.

01:08:16.956 --> 01:08:19.185
Oh, Jonas.
Please don't do this.

01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:23.557
- Aw.
- [Breathing Stops]

01:08:27.198 --> 01:08:28.962
Oh, Jonas.

01:08:31.270 --> 01:08:33.397
[Exhales]

01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:53.481
Hi, Lindy.

01:08:54.993 --> 01:08:57.428
Boys, go outside, please.

01:08:57.496 --> 01:08:59.930
[Sobbing]

01:09:08.073 --> 01:09:11.372
[Door Closes]

01:09:12.511 --> 01:09:14.877
You poor dear.

01:09:14.947 --> 01:09:17.438
I tried, Grandma.
I really did.

01:09:17.515 --> 01:09:21.747
He was so strong. How could he be so strong
after what he went through?

01:09:21.819 --> 01:09:24.913
He was very frightened.
Fear can do that.

01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:29.051
I haven't seen anyone die
since my mom and baby sister.

01:09:29.127 --> 01:09:32.256
It was so horrible to see the life
drain out of him so fast.

01:09:32.331 --> 01:09:36.096
- I'm so sorry, darling.
- It was so awful.

01:09:36.167 --> 01:09:38.398
It wasn't your fault, Belinda.

01:09:43.475 --> 01:09:45.466
It's okay.

01:09:52.151 --> 01:09:57.487
It must be hard on him to lose a patient
he's tried so desperately to save.

01:09:57.556 --> 01:10:01.822
But once he gets past the sadness
and frustration he must feel...

01:10:01.894 --> 01:10:04.158
he will tell you
it wasn't your fault.

01:10:04.229 --> 01:10:06.720
If it wasn't my fault,
then why do I feel like it is?

01:10:06.799 --> 01:10:10.098
Because you care deeply
about people...

01:10:10.169 --> 01:10:13.070
and that's what makes you
hurt for them.

01:10:13.138 --> 01:10:16.938
And that is also what
will make you a good doctor.

01:10:17.009 --> 01:10:20.376
I don't think I'm cut out
to be a doctor after all.

01:10:20.446 --> 01:10:22.744
I'll just stay here and be Doc's assistant,
if he'll let me.

01:10:22.815 --> 01:10:25.909
- Belinda, you can't mean that.
- I'm afraid I do.

01:10:25.984 --> 01:10:27.975
No...

01:10:36.729 --> 01:10:39.254
Whoa.

01:10:39.331 --> 01:10:41.595
Hello, Mrs. Stafford-Smith.

01:10:41.667 --> 01:10:45.296
Did you tell Belinda it was
her fault that poor man died?

01:10:45.370 --> 01:10:48.498
- Of course not.
- Did you tell her it wasn't?

01:10:48.574 --> 01:10:50.701
Well, you don't mean that...

01:10:52.778 --> 01:10:55.110
- Well, I didn't think...
- Exactly!

01:11:01.186 --> 01:11:04.417
[Charles]
All right. That oughta do it.

01:11:09.595 --> 01:11:12.962
[Clark Chuckles] I don't think you'll
have any trouble finding a buyer now.

01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:18.734
I already know the buyer I want.

01:11:18.804 --> 01:11:21.967
Charles, would you and Sadie
like to take this place?

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:23.803
We could never afford a place like this.

01:11:23.876 --> 01:11:26.572
You could if I loaned you the money.

01:11:26.645 --> 01:11:29.671
We could never accept a loan that big.

01:11:29.748 --> 01:11:33.582
What if we called it a mortgage,
except you could pay it off as you can.

01:11:33.652 --> 01:11:35.847
In a way, I owe you, Charles.

01:11:35.921 --> 01:11:38.549
You showed me how good
it feels to practice the law...

01:11:38.624 --> 01:11:40.649
when I'm helping someone
who really needs it.

01:11:40.726 --> 01:11:44.856
So, Charles, what do you say?
Will you take this place off my hands for me?

01:11:44.930 --> 01:11:48.058
Yeah. Yes. Yes, I will.

01:11:48.133 --> 01:11:50.067
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:11:50.135 --> 01:11:54.765
- Yeehaw!
- [Both Laughing]

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:59.004
Oh, that's mighty nice of you, son.
Mighty nice.

01:11:59.077 --> 01:12:02.274
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, thank you.

01:12:14.193 --> 01:12:16.354
Doc?

01:12:16.428 --> 01:12:18.419
Doc, are you here?

01:12:30.742 --> 01:12:34.542
[Thinking]
Dear Doc, I am so sorry to have let you down.

01:12:34.613 --> 01:12:37.548
But you were right.

01:12:37.616 --> 01:12:42.076
I don't have what it takes to be a doctor.

01:12:42.154 --> 01:12:45.146
[Panting]

01:12:46.158 --> 01:12:49.093
[Drew]
Whoa.

01:12:49.161 --> 01:12:52.824
- Can I help?
- She can barely breathe.
We have to get her to Doc.

01:13:00.973 --> 01:13:02.838
Hold onto her.

01:13:07.446 --> 01:13:09.437
Come on, boys.

01:13:16.555 --> 01:13:18.489
[Grunts]
Where's the doctor?

01:13:18.557 --> 01:13:21.685
- Uh, he's not here.
- Belinda, I need your help.

01:13:23.262 --> 01:13:25.696
You have to help her!
She's turning blue!

01:13:25.764 --> 01:13:27.789
I don't know what to do,
Caroline. I'm sorry.

01:13:27.866 --> 01:13:30.664
- You're her only chance right now.
- [Gasps]

01:13:30.736 --> 01:13:33.204
I can't be responsible for Sally's life.

01:13:35.007 --> 01:13:36.975
This is your destiny, right?

01:13:37.042 --> 01:13:41.672
This is what God wants from you.
You have to believe that, Belinda. I do.

01:13:42.948 --> 01:13:45.143
- [Gasping]
- Please!

01:13:45.217 --> 01:13:49.984
Okay. Okay, think.
Okay, trouble breathin'.

01:13:50.055 --> 01:13:52.683
What is it?
What's wrong with my baby?

01:13:52.758 --> 01:13:56.057
It could be a number of things.
If my diagnosis is wrong...

01:13:56.128 --> 01:13:59.063
- Please, Belinda!
- [Gasping Continues]

01:13:59.131 --> 01:14:00.996
Okay.

01:14:03.802 --> 01:14:07.397
You gotta open your mouth, all right?

01:14:09.608 --> 01:14:12.076
There's an abscess
in the area around the tonsils.

01:14:12.144 --> 01:14:15.875
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. It could be quinsy.

01:14:15.948 --> 01:14:21.318
- Is there medicine for it?
- No. There's only one thing to do.

01:14:21.386 --> 01:14:23.877
- I have to lance her throat.
- Then do it!

01:14:23.956 --> 01:14:26.584
I've never done this procedure
before or anything like this.

01:14:26.658 --> 01:14:29.058
I'll help you. Whatever I can do.
What can I do?

01:14:29.127 --> 01:14:32.324
Okay, get the tray
and get the mask.

01:14:34.232 --> 01:14:36.097
Okay, wet this.

01:14:36.168 --> 01:14:38.932
- Okay.
- [Gasping Continues]

01:14:39.004 --> 01:14:41.404
Put this on her mouth
for five seconds.

01:14:41.473 --> 01:14:43.464
Five seconds.

01:14:47.045 --> 01:14:50.776
[Both]
One, two, three...

01:14:50.849 --> 01:14:53.147
four, five.

01:14:56.888 --> 01:14:59.220
You gotta hold her head still
so she won't move.

01:15:05.831 --> 01:15:09.232
Dear God, guide my hand.

01:15:26.718 --> 01:15:28.718
[Mouths Words]

01:15:41.564 --> 01:15:44.727
Looks like she'll be fine.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:47.496
Belinda, what you did...

01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:51.973
It could have gone the other way.
I could have lost her, Drew.

01:15:52.041 --> 01:15:54.066
But you didn't.

01:15:54.143 --> 01:15:58.136
You were smart enough to figure out what to do
and brave enough to do it.

01:15:59.949 --> 01:16:02.850
I was terrified the whole time.

01:16:02.918 --> 01:16:05.352
- It didn't stop you.
- [Door Opens]

01:16:07.223 --> 01:16:11.853
Oh, Belinda, I have been
looking all over for you.

01:16:16.132 --> 01:16:19.431
What's happened? What is it?

01:16:19.502 --> 01:16:22.198
Belinda saved my daughter's life.

01:16:27.109 --> 01:16:30.237
How are you?
Open up for me.

01:16:30.312 --> 01:16:35.147
Well, I bet that throat is really sore, huh?

01:16:35.217 --> 01:16:38.880
Good excuse for your mama
to churn some fresh buttermilk for ya.

01:16:38.954 --> 01:16:42.117
- I sure will.
- [Chuckles]

01:16:53.235 --> 01:16:56.671
You know,
you saved her life.

01:16:56.739 --> 01:16:58.707
But I didn't save Jonas’s.

01:16:58.774 --> 01:17:01.709
Yes, um, about that.

01:17:03.012 --> 01:17:05.139
[Sighs]

01:17:05.214 --> 01:17:08.809
I owe you a very big apology.

01:17:08.884 --> 01:17:12.376
Jonas's death wasn't your fault.

01:17:12.454 --> 01:17:14.513
But I couldn't hold him still.

01:17:14.590 --> 01:17:16.683
But that's not why he died.

01:17:16.759 --> 01:17:20.627
Jonas was dying
when he came to us.

01:17:20.696 --> 01:17:23.859
We were trying to save him,
but unfortunately...

01:17:23.933 --> 01:17:27.334
the surgery was
just too much for him.

01:17:27.403 --> 01:17:31.237
I told you how difficult
it is losing a patient.

01:17:31.307 --> 01:17:36.370
I've been practicing
for 40 years, give or take...

01:17:36.445 --> 01:17:38.436
and it never gets any easier.

01:17:38.514 --> 01:17:40.846
When it hurts this much...

01:17:40.916 --> 01:17:44.374
it just means that...

01:17:44.453 --> 01:17:46.944
you care that much more
about your patients.

01:17:47.022 --> 01:17:50.514
Um, I don't think
I'm cut out to be a doctor.

01:17:50.593 --> 01:17:53.061
Oh, yes, you are, young lady.

01:17:53.128 --> 01:17:58.065
You go back to Boston
with Mrs. Stafford-Smith.

01:17:58.133 --> 01:18:02.866
But you just make darn sure that
you come back here when you're a doctor.

01:18:04.306 --> 01:18:06.240
Doc...

01:18:06.308 --> 01:18:09.038
Well, now...

01:18:09.111 --> 01:18:12.376
don't start crying or I'll...

01:18:12.448 --> 01:18:15.383
I'll think I made
a mistake after all.

01:18:23.859 --> 01:18:25.850
Whoa.

01:18:33.702 --> 01:18:36.398
That's for having more faith in me
than I had in myself.

01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:00.492
Come on. Hup.

01:19:04.033 --> 01:19:07.230
Are you sure you don't want us
to see you off at the stagecoach?

01:19:07.303 --> 01:19:11.205
I'd rather we say good-bye here.

01:19:11.273 --> 01:19:14.709
You know, by train Boston
isn't as far as it once seemed.

01:19:14.777 --> 01:19:16.711
Mm-hmm.

01:19:16.779 --> 01:19:20.044
- Are you all right, Belinda?
- Yes, Mama, I'm fine.

01:19:20.115 --> 01:19:22.948
No second thoughts about leaving
with Mrs. Stafford-Smith?

01:19:23.018 --> 01:19:27.682
No, not anymore.
I feel at peace with my decision.

01:19:27.756 --> 01:19:29.986
So your second thoughts
are about Drew?

01:19:31.093 --> 01:19:35.029
I love him, Mama.
I really do.

01:19:35.097 --> 01:19:37.156
But it could never work.

01:19:37.232 --> 01:19:39.962
Sometimes one dream
is all you can have.

01:19:49.945 --> 01:19:52.539
- Whoa. Whoa.
- [Neighs]

01:19:52.614 --> 01:19:54.548
- Morning.
- Mornin'.

01:19:59.355 --> 01:20:03.382
I just wanted to say good-bye, Clark,
and thank you for everything.

01:20:03.459 --> 01:20:07.418
- You headed home?
- Charles and Sadie are moving onto the farm.

01:20:07.496 --> 01:20:11.193
I'm headed... back
to New York tomorrow.

01:20:11.266 --> 01:20:14.201
I, uh, imagine Belinda left.

01:20:14.269 --> 01:20:17.602
We said our good-byes
with Missie this mornin'.

01:20:17.673 --> 01:20:20.665
She's probably getting
on the stage right about now.

01:20:20.743 --> 01:20:25.510
You asked me once
when I knew I loved Marty.

01:20:25.581 --> 01:20:28.345
- But you never asked me what I did about it.
- What was that?

01:20:28.417 --> 01:20:32.854
She left on a wagon train.
She was going back home.

01:20:34.923 --> 01:20:37.357
I went after her.

01:20:37.426 --> 01:20:40.623
If you love someone, if you truly love them,
you don't let them go.

01:20:43.966 --> 01:20:48.130
- I've learned a lot from you.
- Then what are you doing still standing here?

01:20:49.638 --> 01:20:52.402
Don't you have a stage to catch?

01:21:01.617 --> 01:21:05.576
Last call, Denver stage!
All aboard, folks!

01:21:05.654 --> 01:21:08.885
- Last call, Denver stage.!
- Come on.

01:21:08.957 --> 01:21:10.891
Whoa. Belinda!

01:21:10.959 --> 01:21:12.756
Oh, my goodness.

01:21:14.229 --> 01:21:17.096
Don't go!

01:21:19.535 --> 01:21:22.800
I'll practice in Boston while you're in school.
Then we'll come back here.

01:21:22.871 --> 01:21:25.237
You'd be happy practicing law
in Anderson Corner?

01:21:25.307 --> 01:21:30.210
Anderson Corner is the place
I learned to love the law, and it has you.

01:21:30.279 --> 01:21:32.338
I don't think I could be
truly happy anywhere else.

01:21:32.414 --> 01:21:36.111
- This isn't your world, Drew.
- You're my world.

01:21:39.121 --> 01:21:42.022
I love you, Belinda.
Marry me.

01:21:47.162 --> 01:21:51.895
Oh, there's a train back to Boston most every day.
You'll catch one next week.

01:21:51.967 --> 01:21:54.492
Windsor will meet you at the depot.
Won't you, Windsor?

01:21:58.173 --> 01:22:01.768
I'd love to marry you, Drew.

01:22:29.104 --> 01:22:31.095
[Kisses Cheek]

01:22:37.913 --> 01:22:41.542
Do you, Andrew, take Belinda
to be your lawfully wedded wife...

01:22:41.617 --> 01:22:45.075
to have and to hold,
for richer and for poorer...

01:22:45.154 --> 01:22:49.853
in sickness and in health, forsaking
all others, till death do you part?

01:22:49.925 --> 01:22:52.723
- I do.
- And do you, Belinda, take Andrew...

01:22:52.794 --> 01:22:54.523
to be your lawfully
wedded husband...

01:22:54.596 --> 01:22:57.929
to have and to hold,
for richer and for poorer...

01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.730
in sickness and in health,
forsaking all others...

01:23:00.802 --> 01:23:03.532
- till death do you part?
- I do.

01:23:18.754 --> 01:23:21.518
I now pronounce you man and wife.

01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:23.581
[Applause]

01:23:39.741 --> 01:23:41.868
[Man]
You do look happy.

01:23:41.944 --> 01:23:44.936
- [Guests Chattering]
- [Laughs]

01:24:12.007 --> 01:24:13.804
[Kisses Cheek]

01:24:13.875 --> 01:24:16.343
Bye.

01:24:16.411 --> 01:24:18.174
Mmm. Be safe.

01:24:18.247 --> 01:24:21.011
You know I will.
You know I will.

01:24:21.083 --> 01:24:23.017
Take care, son.

01:24:23.085 --> 01:24:25.986
- Thank you so much.
- Bless you.

01:24:28.690 --> 01:24:31.215
[Both Laugh]

01:24:31.293 --> 01:24:33.921
- Bye, Grandpa.
- Take care, honey.

01:24:33.996 --> 01:24:36.464
[Both Laugh]

01:24:36.531 --> 01:24:38.192
Come here, Jacob.

01:24:39.868 --> 01:24:42.462
Be good.

01:24:42.537 --> 01:24:45.097
Marty.

01:24:45.173 --> 01:24:47.437
Take care.

01:24:49.077 --> 01:24:52.137
- Thank you.
- Absolutely.

01:24:52.214 --> 01:24:55.706
- Take care of my girl.
- Will do.

01:25:01.623 --> 01:25:04.456
You ready?

01:25:04.526 --> 01:25:07.120
[Laughs]
