WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:03.420
(June) WHEN I MOVED

00:01.669 --> 00:03.420
TO MANHATTAN FROM INDIANA

00:03.462 --> 00:04.922
A FEW MONTHS AGO,

00:03.462 --> 00:04.922
I THOUGHT OF IT

00:04.964 --> 00:06.715
AS THE NEXT STEP

00:04.964 --> 00:06.715
IN MY LIFE PLAN.

00:06.757 --> 00:08.300
I HAD NO IDEA THAT

00:06.757 --> 00:08.300
I WAS GONNA MOVE IN

00:08.342 --> 00:09.844
WITH A GIRL THAT I MET

00:08.342 --> 00:09.844
ON craigslist

00:09.885 --> 00:12.680
WHO WAS BASICALLY, WELL,

00:09.885 --> 00:12.680
CRAZY, IN A GREAT WAY,

00:12.721 --> 00:15.098
AND SOMETIMES

00:12.721 --> 00:15.098
A NOT-SO-GREAT WAY.

00:15.140 --> 00:18.059
IT'S BEEN HARD AND FUN

00:15.140 --> 00:18.059
AND HARD,

00:18.101 --> 00:19.854
BUT WHAT'S MADE IT EASIER

00:18.101 --> 00:19.854
HAS BEEN

00:19.895 --> 00:22.021
THE NEW FRIENDS I'VE MADE

00:19.895 --> 00:22.021
ALONG THE WAY,

00:23.106 --> 00:25.526
WHICH IS WHY IT'S SO DIFFICULT

00:25.567 --> 00:28.069
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO ONE OF THEM

00:25.567 --> 00:28.069
RIGHT NOW.

00:28.111 --> 00:31.239
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE

00:28.111 --> 00:31.239
AT JAMES VAN DER BEEK'S FUNERAL.

00:31.281 --> 00:33.868
JAMES VAN DER BEEK'S VIKING

00:31.281 --> 00:33.868
FUNERAL IN CENTRAL PARK, JUNE.

00:33.909 --> 00:35.870
DON'T UNDERDESCRIBE

00:33.909 --> 00:35.870
THE AWESOMENESS.

00:35.911 --> 00:37.788
JUST HOW ILLEGAL IS THIS?

00:37.830 --> 00:40.499
ABOUT AS ILLEGAL AS THAT

00:37.830 --> 00:40.499
PANDA FAT EYE CREAM YOU USE.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.083
YOU USE PANDA ON YOUR FACE?

00:42.125 --> 00:43.460
LUTHER IS 76 YEARS OLD.

00:43.502 --> 00:46.463
SHUT... UP... BITCH.

00:46.505 --> 00:48.089

01:04.314 --> 01:06.316
OH, HEY, JUNE, COME HERE.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.402
COME SIT BY ME.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.402
I NEED TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

COME ON.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.488
GOOD. SIT.

01:11.530 --> 01:12.781
OKAY, COME CLOSE.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.616
(whispers) YOUR SWEATER

01:12.823 --> 01:14.616
LOOKS LIKE

01:14.658 --> 01:17.160
A PUMPKIN MATED WITH A TURD.

01:14.658 --> 01:17.160
(inhales sharply)

01:17.202 --> 01:19.120
I THOUGHT YOU WERE

01:17.202 --> 01:19.120
GONNA GIVE ME A HUG.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.122
NOPE.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.122
NO.

01:21.164 --> 01:22.624
(singsongy) IT CAME!

01:22.666 --> 01:24.585
OOH! READ IT! READ IT!

01:24.626 --> 01:27.922
"DEAR, JAMES,

01:24.626 --> 01:27.922
IT'S THAT TIME OF THE YEAR--

01:27.963 --> 01:30.758
"THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE SERIES

01:27.963 --> 01:30.758
FINALE OF 'DAWSON'S CREEK.'

01:30.799 --> 01:32.133
"CAN YOU BELIEVE

01:30.799 --> 01:32.133
IT'S BEEN ALMOST TEN YEARS

01:32.175 --> 01:34.511
"SINCE IT WENT OFF THE AIR???

01:34.553 --> 01:36.513
"WE THOUGHT WE'D WRITE YOU AGAIN

01:34.553 --> 01:36.513
TO SEE IF YOU'D BE INTERESTED

01:36.555 --> 01:38.139
"IN DOING A REUNION SHOW.

01:38.181 --> 01:39.850
"AS ALWAYS, WE'RE IN IF YOU ARE.

01:39.892 --> 01:42.561
"SINCERELY, MICHELLE, KATIE,

01:39.892 --> 01:42.561
AND JOSH."

01:42.603 --> 01:44.438
HOLY WOW!

01:44.479 --> 01:47.399
OH, LET ME TOUCH--

01:44.479 --> 01:47.399
TOO BAD

01:44.479 --> 01:47.399
IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.150
(laughs)

01:47.441 --> 01:49.150
WAIT, JAMES.

01:49.192 --> 01:50.318
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

01:50.360 --> 01:51.612
THEY SEND ME

01:50.360 --> 01:51.612
ONE OF THOSE EVERY YEAR.

01:51.653 --> 01:54.197
LISTEN, THEY CAN GET NOMINATED

01:51.653 --> 01:54.197
FOR ALL THE OSCARS THEY WANT,

01:54.239 --> 01:56.617
YOU DON'T PUT THE BEATLES BACK

01:54.239 --> 01:56.617
TOGETHER WITHOUT JOHN LENNON.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.452
AND I'M LENNON  AND  McCARTNEY,

01:56.658 --> 01:58.452
BITCH.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.662
YEAH, YOU ARE!

01:58.493 --> 02:00.662
YOU ARE A KING, JAMES.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.414
(gasps) KING JAMES.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.041
LIKE THE BIBLE.

02:04.083 --> 02:06.668
LET'S GO OUT AND CELEBRATE

02:04.083 --> 02:06.668
HOW AWESOME YOU ARE.

02:06.710 --> 02:10.171
ABSOLUTELY. ANYTHING YOU WANNA

02:06.710 --> 02:10.171
DO, YOU JUST NAME IT.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.256
(squeals)

02:11.298 --> 02:13.174
(electronic music playing)

02:13.216 --> 02:14.885
(speaks indistinctly)

02:16.637 --> 02:19.807
(giggles) BYE. CHARGE LESS

02:16.637 --> 02:19.807
FOR YOUR MAGAZINE.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.643
HMM.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.186
BIG-ASS HAT.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.731
SEND IN THE TALL

02:25.228 --> 02:27.731
AND SKINNIES.

02:30.734 --> 02:33.194
JUNE, ARE YOU FEELING OKAY?

02:33.236 --> 02:35.656
YOU'RE ANGRILY DECRUMBING

02:33.236 --> 02:35.656
THE MUFFIN CASE.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.075
JAMES WON'T DO

02:35.697 --> 02:38.075
A "DAWSON'S CREEK" REUNION.

02:38.117 --> 02:39.994
I COULD ASK THAT QUESTION

02:38.117 --> 02:39.994
A THOUSAND TIMES

02:40.035 --> 02:41.787
AND STILL NOT BELIEVE

02:40.035 --> 02:41.787
THAT'S YOUR ANSWER.

02:41.829 --> 02:42.997
THE REST OF THE CAST IS IN,

02:43.038 --> 02:44.414
BUT JAMES

02:43.038 --> 02:44.414
WON'T EVEN CONSIDER IT.

02:44.456 --> 02:46.207
HE LIKES SAYING NO TO THEM

02:46.249 --> 02:48.585
BECAUSE IT MAKES HIM

02:46.249 --> 02:48.585
FEEL LIKE A BIG SHOT.

02:48.627 --> 02:50.045
YOU SEEM REALLY UPSET

02:48.627 --> 02:50.045
ABOUT THIS.

02:50.087 --> 02:52.506
YOU KNOW, GROWING UP IN INDIANA,

02:50.087 --> 02:52.506
THAT SHOW WAS A RELIGION.

02:52.547 --> 02:55.092
MY FRIENDS AND I--

02:52.547 --> 02:55.092
WE WERE OBSESSED WITH IT.

02:55.134 --> 02:56.217
OKAY, I GET IT.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.719
LIKE "MOESHA" WAS FOR ME.

02:57.761 --> 03:00.597
I'M JUST KIDDING. I JUST SAID

02:57.761 --> 03:00.597
THAT BECAUSE I'M BLACK.

03:00.639 --> 03:02.891
(laughs) I NEVER WATCHED

03:00.639 --> 03:02.891
"MOESHA."

03:02.933 --> 03:06.645
CELESTE, TORI, MARGARET, AND I

03:02.933 --> 03:06.645
MEMORIZED EVERY EPISODE.

03:06.687 --> 03:10.024
DO YOU KNOW HOW AWESOME

03:06.687 --> 03:10.024
IT WOULD BE IF I CALLED THEM UP

03:10.065 --> 03:12.693
AND TOLD THEM THAT JAMES WAS

03:10.065 --> 03:12.693
DOING A REUNION SHOW?

03:12.734 --> 03:14.611
IT'S BEEN A WHILE SINCE

03:12.734 --> 03:14.611
I HAD SOME GOOD NEWS.

03:14.653 --> 03:16.488
I LOST THE JOB THAT

03:14.653 --> 03:16.488
I MOVED TO NEW YORK FOR,

03:16.530 --> 03:18.490
I BROKE UP WITH MY FIANCE,

03:16.530 --> 03:18.490
AND I'M PRETTY SURE THAT

03:18.532 --> 03:21.660
MY BOOBS HAVE DECREASED A CUP

03:18.532 --> 03:21.660
SIZE BECAUSE OF ALL THE SADNESS.

03:21.702 --> 03:24.245
WHY WON'T JAMES DO THIS

03:21.702 --> 03:24.245
FOR ME?

03:24.287 --> 03:26.832
JUNE, IF IT'S

03:24.287 --> 03:26.832
THAT IMPORTANT TO YOU,

03:26.874 --> 03:28.249
TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.670
WHEN YOU GET PASSIONATE ABOUT

03:28.291 --> 03:31.670
SOMETHING, YOU'RE HARD TO STOP.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.255
REMEMBER YOUR WHOLE THING

03:31.712 --> 03:34.255
AGAINST YELLOW RAISINS?

03:34.297 --> 03:37.092
ALBINO ABOMINATIONS OF NATURE!

03:37.134 --> 03:38.886
HEY. HEY.

03:37.134 --> 03:38.886
YOU CONVINCED ME, OKAY?

03:38.927 --> 03:42.347
I'M CONVINCED.

03:38.927 --> 03:42.347
JUNE, YOU GOT CRAZY EYES.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.557
(Chloe sighs)

03:43.598 --> 03:46.267
I LOVE IT

03:43.598 --> 03:46.267
WHEN THE MODELS FALL.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.187
THEY'RE LIKE GIRAFFES

03:46.309 --> 03:48.187
COLLAPSING IN THE JUNGLE.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.313
OOH! GOOD WORK, MARBLES.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.648
(can rattles, projector clicks)

03:51.690 --> 03:55.276
846,251

03:55.318 --> 03:57.529
IS THE NUMBER OF TEENAGE GIRLS

03:57.571 --> 04:00.490
WHO WATCHED THE FINALE

03:57.571 --> 04:00.490
OF "DAWSON'S CREEK."

04:00.532 --> 04:02.659
(click)

04:00.532 --> 04:02.659
I WAS ONE OF THEM.

04:02.701 --> 04:04.285
(laughs)

04:04.327 --> 04:05.954
(click)

04:04.327 --> 04:05.954
AND SO WAS CELESTE...

04:05.996 --> 04:07.372
(click)

04:05.996 --> 04:07.372
MARGARET...

04:07.414 --> 04:08.790
(click)

04:07.414 --> 04:08.790
AND TORI.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.085
DID THESE GIRLS DIE

04:08.832 --> 04:11.085
IN A DRUNK-DRIVING ACCIDENT

04:11.126 --> 04:12.169
OR SOMETHING?

04:12.211 --> 04:16.215
IS THIS A MEMORIAL/INTERVENTION/

04:12.211 --> 04:16.215
(snores)?

04:16.256 --> 04:19.300
YOUR SHOW REFLECTED WHAT WAS

04:16.256 --> 04:19.300
GOING ON IN OUR LIVES.

04:19.342 --> 04:22.470
WHEN AARON DeMAYO BROKE UP

04:19.342 --> 04:22.470
WITH ME IN SEVENTH GRADE,

04:22.512 --> 04:24.347
I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA DIE,

04:24.389 --> 04:28.102
AND THEN I TURNED ON THE TV,

04:24.389 --> 04:28.102
AND GRAMS GOT THE DIAGNOSIS.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.310
CANCER.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.312
SHE WAS  REALLY  GOING TO DIE.

04:31.354 --> 04:34.108
THE WAY YOU DEALT WITH THAT,

04:31.354 --> 04:34.108
YOUR STRENGTH--

04:34.149 --> 04:37.527
IT GAVE ME STRENGTH,

04:34.149 --> 04:37.527
AND WE GOT THROUGH IT,

04:37.569 --> 04:39.071
TOGETHER.

04:40.239 --> 04:42.157
RACK ATTACK! RACK ATTACK!

04:40.239 --> 04:42.157
RACK ATTACK!

04:42.199 --> 04:44.201
RACK ATTACK!

04:42.199 --> 04:44.201
CHLOE, PLEASE,

04:42.199 --> 04:44.201
JUNE IS IN THE MIDDLE

04:44.243 --> 04:46.161
OF A MAKESHIFT LIVING ROOM

04:44.243 --> 04:46.161
PRESENTATION.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.580
THOSE GIRLS WHO WATCHED YOU

04:46.203 --> 04:48.580
ON TV...

04:48.622 --> 04:50.791
(click)

04:50.832 --> 04:52.793
THEY'RE NOW HAVING

04:50.832 --> 04:52.793
DAUGHTERS OF THEIR OWN.

04:52.834 --> 04:53.794
ONE WOMAN...

04:53.835 --> 04:55.837
(click)

04:53.835 --> 04:55.837
BECOMES TWO.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.798
INDIAN.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.007
WOMAN.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.593
INDIAN. WOMAN.

05:01.635 --> 05:03.344
IT'S THE CIRCLE OF LIFE,

05:01.635 --> 05:03.344
JAMES.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.721
(click)

05:04.763 --> 05:08.391
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO BREAK

05:04.763 --> 05:08.391
THAT CIRCLE?

05:08.433 --> 05:10.393
OH, MY GOD. THIS IS SO LAME.

05:10.435 --> 05:12.813
IT IS LAME...

05:12.854 --> 05:14.606
OF ME FOR PUTTING THIS OFF

05:12.854 --> 05:14.606
FOR SO LONG.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.774
WHAT?

05:15.816 --> 05:18.359
I CAN'T BELIEVE

05:15.816 --> 05:18.359
HOW SELFISH I'VE BEEN.

05:18.401 --> 05:21.822
CRUMPLING UP THOSE LETTERS

05:18.401 --> 05:21.822
EVERY YEAR JUST 'CAUSE I CAN.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.531
THIS IS BIGGER THAN ME.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.826
I-I NEED TO DO A REUNION

05:23.573 --> 05:25.826
FOR THE FANS.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.245
I'M KING JAMES,

05:25.867 --> 05:28.245
THE LION KING.

05:28.287 --> 05:29.412
(laughs)

05:28.287 --> 05:29.412
(door closes)

05:29.454 --> 05:32.624
JUNE, WHAT THE HELL?

05:29.454 --> 05:32.624
WHY DID YOU DO THAT?

05:32.666 --> 05:35.460
WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH WHETHER

05:32.666 --> 05:35.460
OR NOT JAMES HAS A REUNION?

05:35.502 --> 05:38.463
BECAUSE THE LETTERS HE GETS

05:35.502 --> 05:38.463
FROM THE CAST ARE FAKE.

05:38.505 --> 05:39.840
I'M THE ONE

05:38.505 --> 05:39.840
WHO'S BEEN WRITING THEM

05:39.881 --> 05:41.424
AND SENDING THEM

05:39.881 --> 05:41.424
TO HIM EVERY YEAR.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.469
VINDALOO.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.469
(door closes)

05:49.141 --> 05:51.643
YOU'VE BEEN WRITING

05:49.141 --> 05:51.643
FAKE LETTERS EVERY YEAR?

05:51.685 --> 05:54.437
YES. SEE? I EVEN USED THE SAME

05:51.685 --> 05:54.437
PEN TO SIGN ALL THREE NAMES.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.857
I SPELLED "HOLMES" WRONG.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.857
I SHOULD REALLY TRY HARDER.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.025
WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS?

05:58.066 --> 05:59.400
WHEN JAMES GETS TO TURN DOWN

05:59.442 --> 06:01.028
KATIE, MICHELLE, AND JOSH

05:59.442 --> 06:01.028
EVERY YEAR,

06:01.069 --> 06:02.321
IT MAKES HIM FEEL

06:01.069 --> 06:02.321
REALLY POWERFUL,

06:02.361 --> 06:05.406
AND ON THAT DAY, I CAN ASK HIM

06:02.361 --> 06:05.406
FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD,

06:05.448 --> 06:06.407
AND HE WON'T REFUSE ME,

06:06.449 --> 06:08.409
JUST LIKE DON CORLEONE

06:08.451 --> 06:10.245
ON THE DAY OF HIS DAUGHTER'S

06:08.451 --> 06:10.245
WEDDING IN "THE GODFATHER."

06:10.287 --> 06:13.372
("Tarantella" playing)

06:17.252 --> 06:19.129
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE TRANQ-ING

06:17.252 --> 06:19.129
A HOT AUSTRIAN DUDE

06:19.171 --> 06:21.422
AND HEARING THE BODY FALL.

06:21.464 --> 06:23.424
TRANQ SEX--IT'S CONSENSUAL.

06:23.466 --> 06:25.344
YOU ARE SO MANIPULATIVE

06:25.384 --> 06:26.720
AND SELFISH.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.013
OKAY, THAT'S TRUE. I AM.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.431
BUT I'M ALSO DOING THIS

06:28.055 --> 06:30.431
FOR JAMES.

06:30.473 --> 06:33.810
HE SHOULDN'T RELIVE THE PAST BY

06:30.473 --> 06:33.810
DOING SOME STUPID REUNION SHOW.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.645
THERE'S NO POINT

06:33.852 --> 06:35.645
IN LOOKING BACK.

06:35.687 --> 06:37.480
YOU HAVE TO MOVE FORWARD,

06:35.687 --> 06:37.480
LIKE A SHARK

06:37.522 --> 06:39.149
OR A TRANQ DART.

06:39.191 --> 06:42.903
JUST BECAUSE NO ONE IN THE CAST

06:39.191 --> 06:42.903
HAS INITIATED A REUNION

06:42.944 --> 06:45.697
DOESN'T MEAN

06:42.944 --> 06:45.697
THAT IT IS NOT A GOOD IDEA.

06:45.739 --> 06:49.243
I  AM GOING TO MAKE SURE

06:45.739 --> 06:49.243
THAT IT HAPPENS.

06:49.284 --> 06:53.496
WELL,  I  AM GOING TO MAKE SURE

06:49.284 --> 06:53.496
THAT IT DOESN'T.

07:07.302 --> 07:10.471
IF WE CALL MICHELLE FIRST, THEN

07:07.302 --> 07:10.471
EVERYONE ELSE WILL GET ON BOARD.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.391
BUT WE CAN'T CALL JOSH LAST

07:12.432 --> 07:14.475
'CAUSE I'M PRETTY SURE

07:12.432 --> 07:14.475
HE'S IN LOVE WITH ME.

07:14.517 --> 07:17.104
I THINK YOU SHOULD CALL KATIE

07:14.517 --> 07:17.104
FIRST. I LOVE HER.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.314
I'VE GONE AS HER

07:17.145 --> 07:19.314

12:01.680 --> 12:02.763
THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO IT?

12:02.805 --> 12:04.057
NO, THEY'RE NOT SAYING THAT.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.766
THEY WILL NEVER SAY THAT.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.766
(chuckles)

12:05.808 --> 12:06.767
SO THEY ARE GONNA DO IT?

12:06.809 --> 12:08.395
YEAH, IN THE HOLLYWOOD WAY.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.563
W-WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

12:09.604 --> 12:10.605
THEY'RE NOT GONNA DO IT.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.440
THEY'RE INTO IT 100%.

12:12.482 --> 12:13.774
THEY'RE JUST NOT GONNA DO IT.

12:13.816 --> 12:14.775
DID THEY SAY WHY?

12:14.817 --> 12:17.654
YEAH. I WROTE IT DOWN.

12:17.696 --> 12:18.779
"THEY HATE YOU."

12:18.821 --> 12:21.824
Yeah. They hate you.

12:21.866 --> 12:24.285
(clicks tongue)

12:24.327 --> 12:26.037
ASK HIM IF HE CAN GET US

12:24.327 --> 12:26.037
"BOOK OF MORMON" TICKETS

12:26.079 --> 12:28.831
ON THE 20th,

12:26.079 --> 12:28.831
BUT NOT THE MATINEE.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.792
(mouths word)

12:31.834 --> 12:33.002
(door closes)

12:39.884 --> 12:41.886
(door bells jingle)

12:42.845 --> 12:43.597
BUSY, HEY.

12:43.638 --> 12:45.890
THANK YOU FOR MEETING ME.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.392
WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS QUICK.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.018
I DON'T WANT ANYONE

12:47.434 --> 12:49.018
TO SEE ME WITH YOU.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.520
I MEAN, DO YOU KNOW

12:49.060 --> 12:50.520
WHAT THE OTHERS WOULD DO

12:50.562 --> 12:52.188
IF THEY FOUND OUT?

12:52.230 --> 12:54.899
I MEAN, NO ONE'S GONNA TAKE ME

12:52.230 --> 12:54.899
OUT TO A NICE FANCY RESTAURANT

12:54.941 --> 12:56.735
AND ORDER

12:54.941 --> 12:56.735
THE CHERRIES JUBILEE.

12:56.775 --> 12:58.403
IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE GONNA

12:56.775 --> 12:58.403
TAKE ME TO CHIPPENDALES

12:58.445 --> 13:01.322
AND LOOK AT SOME DONG WITH ME,

12:58.445 --> 13:01.322
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

13:01.364 --> 13:02.449
UH, YEAH.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.617
THANKS FOR MEETING ME.

13:03.658 --> 13:04.867
WHAT DO YOU WANT, JAMES?

13:04.909 --> 13:06.620
I DON'T UNDERSTAND

13:04.909 --> 13:06.620
WHAT'S GOING ON.

13:06.661 --> 13:08.246
WHY DOES EVERYBODY HATE ME?

13:08.288 --> 13:09.539
I THOUGHT WE ENDED THE SHOW

13:08.288 --> 13:09.539
ON SUCH GOOD TERMS.

13:09.581 --> 13:11.207
SERIOUSLY, YOU DON'T KNOW?

13:11.249 --> 13:12.417
NO.

13:13.501 --> 13:16.087
YOU SHORTED US

13:13.501 --> 13:16.087
FOR THE END-OF-THE-SHOW GIFT.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.631
WHAT?

13:17.672 --> 13:20.925
YOU  CONVINCED THE CAST

13:17.672 --> 13:20.925
TO BUY ROWBOATS

13:20.967 --> 13:24.053
FOR THE ENTIRE CREW

13:20.967 --> 13:24.053
BECAUSE IT WAS CREEK-THEMED,

13:24.095 --> 13:26.097
AND THEN YOU NEVER PAID

13:24.095 --> 13:26.097
YOUR SHARE.

13:26.139 --> 13:31.770
WE WERE STUCK WITH A BILL

13:26.139 --> 13:31.770
FOR 145 BOATS, JAMES.

13:31.810 --> 13:34.355
I WAS ONLY ON THE STUPID SHOW

13:31.810 --> 13:34.355
FOR TWO SEASONS.

13:34.397 --> 13:37.858
I BARELY BROKE EVEN.

13:34.397 --> 13:37.858
I HAD TO SELL MY HORSE CHA-CHA.

13:37.900 --> 13:41.028
ALL RIGHT, THAT WAS A TOTAL

13:37.900 --> 13:41.028
OVERSIGHT. I HAD NO IDEA.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.239
WHATEVER MY SHARE WAS,

13:41.070 --> 13:43.239
I'D BE HAPPY TO CHIP IN NOW.

13:43.281 --> 13:45.241
NO, NO, NO. IT'S TOO LATE

13:43.281 --> 13:45.241
FOR THAT, OKAY?

13:45.283 --> 13:48.286
THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE EVER GOING

13:45.283 --> 13:48.286
TO REPAIR THOSE RELATIONSHIPS.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.790
THAT SHIP HAS SAILED,

13:48.328 --> 13:51.790
AS IT WERE.

13:55.752 --> 13:58.588
YEAH.

13:55.752 --> 13:58.588
I-I ORDERED YOU SOME FOOD.

13:58.630 --> 14:00.381
I, UH, I DON'T REALLY KNOW

13:58.630 --> 14:00.381
WHAT GIRLS EAT.

14:00.423 --> 14:02.925
OH, SWEETIE, WE DON'T.

14:00.423 --> 14:02.925
WE DON'T EAT.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.261
WE JUST LIVE IN CAVES,

14:02.967 --> 14:05.261
HAVING OUR PERIODS,

14:05.303 --> 14:07.555
UNTIL IT'S TIME TO HAVE SEX

14:05.303 --> 14:07.555
WITH THE FIRST GUY

14:07.597 --> 14:11.892
WHO BUYS US A WINE COOLER

14:07.597 --> 14:11.892
AND REMINDS US OF OUR DAD.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.312
SINCE IT'S HERE,

14:11.934 --> 14:14.312
I MEAN, MUSTARD, MAYBE.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.148
DIET SODA WOULD BE GREAT.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.148
AND A TO-GO BOX?

14:18.857 --> 14:21.944
ALL MY FRIENDS ARE

14:18.857 --> 14:21.944
DOING BETTER THAN ME.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.322
THEY ALL HATE ME.

14:24.364 --> 14:26.407
I THOUGHT THEY WERE IN LOVE

14:24.364 --> 14:26.407
WITH ME.

14:26.449 --> 14:28.409
THEY DON'T WANT

14:26.449 --> 14:28.409
TO RELIVE THE PAST.

14:28.451 --> 14:31.538
AND WHY WOULD THEY? THEY'RE

14:28.451 --> 14:31.538
DOING GREAT IN THE PRESENT.

14:31.579 --> 14:34.915
I THOUGHT FOR SURE

14:31.579 --> 14:34.915
JOSH WAS IN LOVE WITH ME.

14:34.957 --> 14:37.711
MY LIFE WAS BETTER

14:34.957 --> 14:37.711
TEN YEARS AGO.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.754
MY LIFE WAS BETTER

14:37.752 --> 14:39.754
TEN YEARS AGO.

14:39.796 --> 14:44.008
OH, MY GOD. ARE WE

14:39.796 --> 14:44.008
AT A BLUES BAR IN CHICAGO?

14:44.050 --> 14:46.720
ARE WE WATCHING AN OLD LADY

14:44.050 --> 14:46.720
RUN FOR THE BUS?

14:46.761 --> 14:48.429
ARE WE LISTENING

14:46.761 --> 14:48.429
TO A CAB DRIVER TALK ABOUT

14:48.471 --> 14:49.639
HOW HE WAS A DENTIST

14:48.471 --> 14:49.639
BACK IN PAKISTAN?

14:49.681 --> 14:51.808
BECAUSE YOU PEOPLE ARE

14:49.681 --> 14:51.808
DEPRESSING THE HELL OUT OF ME.

14:51.850 --> 14:55.311
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY,

14:51.850 --> 14:55.311
CHLOE?

14:55.353 --> 14:56.771
I'M NOT THE KING ANYMORE.

14:56.813 --> 15:00.149
SEE THIS? THIS IS WHAT

14:56.813 --> 15:00.149
I WAS TRYING TO PREVENT,

15:00.191 --> 15:02.819
THE REASON I TELL MY FRIENDS

15:00.191 --> 15:02.819
NOT TO LOOK BACK.

15:02.861 --> 15:05.946
YOU HAVE TO WALK AWAY

15:02.861 --> 15:05.946
FROM THE PAST IN SLOW-MOTION

15:05.988 --> 15:09.450
AS IT EXPLODES BEHIND YOU

15:05.988 --> 15:09.450
LIKE IN A JOHN WOO MOVIE.

15:09.492 --> 15:10.951
JUNE, YOU JUST HAD TO GO

15:10.993 --> 15:13.162
AND MAKE THAT STUPID

15:10.993 --> 15:13.162
PowerPoint PRESENTATION.

15:13.204 --> 15:14.330
OH, THIS IS MY FAULT?

15:14.372 --> 15:15.956
FINALLY, YOU ADMIT IT.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.958
NOW GET TO YOUR ROOM AND PUT ON

15:15.998 --> 15:17.958
SOMETHING I DON'T HATE.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.503
THEY'RE AUTUMNAL SWEATERS,

15:18.000 --> 15:20.503
AND BITE ME.

15:21.671 --> 15:24.215
ARE WE DONE NOW?

15:21.671 --> 15:24.215
CAN WE MOVE ON FROM THIS?

15:24.257 --> 15:27.468
YEAH, WE CAN MOVE ON...

15:27.510 --> 15:29.846
TO PLAN "B"...

15:29.888 --> 15:31.347
SOMETHING BETTER.

15:31.389 --> 15:34.225
SOMETHING BIGGER.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.436
I DON'T NEED THOSE GUYS.

15:36.477 --> 15:39.647
IT WASN'T

15:36.477 --> 15:39.647
"PACEY, JEN, AND JOEY'S CREEK."

15:45.403 --> 15:47.864
DON'T YOU SEE?

15:45.403 --> 15:47.864
DOING A REUNION IS RIGHT.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.198
IT'S RIGHT FOR US,

15:47.906 --> 15:49.198
IT'S RIGHT FOR THE FANS,

15:49.240 --> 15:50.825
AND IT'S RIGHT FOR US.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.619
PLUS, DOING IT THIS WAY

15:50.867 --> 15:52.619
WOULD BE COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.371
NOBODY WOULD SEE IT COMING.

15:55.413 --> 15:56.497
(Muzak playing)

15:56.539 --> 15:58.416
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:56.539 --> 15:58.416
ARE YOU SHOPPING?

15:58.458 --> 16:01.252
UH-HUH. YEAH. YEAH.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.252
LOVE GROCERIES.

16:01.294 --> 16:05.005
ANYWAY, "MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE"

16:01.294 --> 16:05.005
MEETS DAWSON.

16:05.047 --> 16:07.508
RIGHT? YOU DO A SPECIAL REUNION

16:05.047 --> 16:07.508
EPISODE OF YOUR SHOW,

16:07.550 --> 16:10.010
AND I'LL BE ON IT.

16:07.550 --> 16:10.010
I'LL BE IN THE MIDDLE WITH YOU.

16:10.052 --> 16:12.221
JAMES, ENOUGH.

16:12.263 --> 16:13.890
YOU'RE TALKING NONSENSE.

16:13.932 --> 16:15.224
HOW'D YOU FIND ME HERE?

16:15.266 --> 16:16.392
I DOWNLOADED "GRINDR,"

16:16.434 --> 16:17.852
THAT GAY HOOK-UP APP,

16:16.434 --> 16:17.852
ON YOUR PHONE.

16:17.894 --> 16:20.354
I CAN TRACK YOU AT ALL TIMES.

16:17.894 --> 16:20.354
(cell phone alert chimes)

16:25.234 --> 16:27.946
(mouths words)

16:27.987 --> 16:30.114
JAMES, COME ON.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.114
LET'S GO HOME.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.699
YOU'RE REALLY

16:30.156 --> 16:31.699
UPSETTING FRANKIE.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.242
I'M NOT UPSETTING FRANKIE.

16:33.284 --> 16:34.327
YOU TOOK MY WHIPPED CREAM.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.078
F-FRANKIE.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.205
FRANKIE. FRANKIE, YOU'RE

16:36.120 --> 16:38.205
NOT UNDERSTANDING, OKAY?

16:38.247 --> 16:41.125
THIS COULD BE HUGE.

16:38.247 --> 16:41.125
IT'S GONNA BE AMAZING.

16:41.167 --> 16:43.670
I GOT MY BEST GUY WORKING

16:41.167 --> 16:43.670
ON THE SCRIPT AS WE SPEAK.

16:43.711 --> 16:46.046
"INTERIOR, WHITE HOUSE, DAY.

16:46.088 --> 16:49.258
"PRESIDENT LEERY SITS

16:46.088 --> 16:49.258

16:49.300 --> 16:52.846
MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE

16:49.300 --> 16:52.846
APPROACHES, WEARING A...

16:52.887 --> 16:54.848
"TASTEFUL PANTSUIT.

16:58.392 --> 17:02.522
"MALCOLM--'THANK YOU.'"

17:02.563 --> 17:05.900
YOU HAVE DONE IT AGAIN,

17:02.563 --> 17:05.900
LUTHER VANDROSS WILSON.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.360
(laughs)

17:07.401 --> 17:09.320
(chuckles) ALL RIGHT, JAMES,

17:07.401 --> 17:09.320
IT WAS--IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.280
I'M A FAN, BUT, UH,

17:09.362 --> 17:11.280
I'M THROWING A BARBECUE.

17:11.322 --> 17:12.490
I REALLY NEED

17:11.322 --> 17:12.490
TO GET MY GROCERIES.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.950
THAT'S PERFECT!

17:12.532 --> 17:13.950
W-WE'LL WRITE THE BARBECUE

17:13.992 --> 17:15.326
INTO THE SCRIPT!

17:15.368 --> 17:17.578
YOU'RE FEELING NEGLECTED 'CAUSE

17:15.368 --> 17:17.578
YOU--YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE.

17:17.620 --> 17:20.540
I'M FEELING SO MANY EMOTIONS,

17:17.620 --> 17:20.540
I'M BAWLING MY EYES OUT.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.249
HOT TEARS, GREAT FOOD--

17:22.291 --> 17:23.543
(whoosh)

17:24.752 --> 17:25.586
OH.

17:25.628 --> 17:26.671
NICE SHOT.

17:26.713 --> 17:30.257
IT'S MY GROCERY LIST.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.510
IT'S PROBABLY

17:30.299 --> 17:32.510
WORTH SOMETHING.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.765
OH.

17:41.352 --> 17:42.436
(door closes)

17:49.527 --> 17:50.110
HI, JAMES.

17:50.152 --> 17:52.154
HOW YOU FEELING?

17:52.196 --> 17:54.699
MARK-PAUL GOSSELAAR?

17:54.741 --> 17:57.035
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:57.076 --> 17:57.994
I CALLED HIM.

17:58.036 --> 17:59.119
TA-DA!

17:59.161 --> 18:00.120
I LOVE YOU.

18:00.162 --> 18:01.915
WHEN I WAS 10,

18:00.162 --> 18:01.915
I HAD A SHIH TZU,

18:01.956 --> 18:04.208
AND I NAMED IT

18:01.956 --> 18:04.208
DOG-PAUL GOSSELAAR.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.126
SO DID I.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.629
CHLOE TOLD ME ABOUT

18:06.168 --> 18:08.629
YOUR REUNION EPISODE.

18:08.671 --> 18:10.172
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE--

18:10.214 --> 18:13.133
TO TELL YOU,

18:10.214 --> 18:13.133
YOU NEED TO MOVE ON.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.969
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.969
YOU DON'T--YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

18:15.011 --> 18:18.222
DON'T I? YOU THINK I HAVEN'T

18:15.011 --> 18:18.222
CORNERED FRANKIE MUNIZ BEFORE?

18:18.264 --> 18:20.140
I ACCOSTED HIM AT A ZOO.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.141
YOU SMELL AMAZING.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.936
WHY ARE THOSE HIPPOS

18:21.183 --> 18:22.936
ALWAYS SLEEPING?

18:22.977 --> 18:25.312
HAVE YOU READ MY BOOK, AMIGO?

18:25.354 --> 18:27.356
IT'S ALL ABOUT FINDING THE NOW.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.150
YOU SEE...

18:30.192 --> 18:34.321
I HAD TO CALL

18:30.192 --> 18:34.321
A TIME-OUT ON MY OWN SELF.

18:34.363 --> 18:37.157
BUMMED AROUND SOLVANG

18:34.363 --> 18:37.157
FOR A WHILE IN A PEDAL CAR.

18:37.199 --> 18:39.201
REALLY GOT INTO DUTCH CANDY.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.536
WELL, IT'S ALL IN THE BOOK.

18:40.578 --> 18:44.540
SEE, YOU AND I BOTH

18:40.578 --> 18:44.540
BECAME FAMOUS EARLY ON

18:44.582 --> 18:45.959
FOR AN ICONIC ROLE,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.168
BUT WE CAN'T LET THAT ROLE

18:46.000 --> 18:48.168
DEFINE US.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.379
THAT'S WHY I SIGNED IT

18:48.210 --> 18:50.379
SPECIALLY FOR YOU.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.173
"BEST. MARK-PAUL."

18:53.215 --> 18:54.174
TA-DA!

18:55.259 --> 18:57.177
DAWSON LEERY

18:57.219 --> 18:58.596
IS TALKING

18:58.638 --> 19:00.222
TO ZACK MORRIS.

19:00.264 --> 19:03.893
I AM  SO  INTO THIS.

19:03.935 --> 19:05.394
I HOPE THEY KISS.

19:05.436 --> 19:06.687
(Mark-Paul) ...HAVE

19:05.436 --> 19:06.687
THE BEST YEARS IN FRONT OF YOU.

19:06.729 --> 19:08.898
WHY AM I SO INTO THIS?

19:08.940 --> 19:12.234
I AM A GROWN WOMAN.

19:08.940 --> 19:12.234
I AM NOT A TEENAGER.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.778
WHY?

19:13.820 --> 19:16.030
WHY CAN'T I JUST MOVE ON

19:13.820 --> 19:16.030
LIKE THE REST OF MY FRIENDS?

19:16.072 --> 19:18.240
OH, MY GOD.

19:16.072 --> 19:18.240
SCREW YOUR FRIENDS.

19:18.282 --> 19:21.368
THAT STAY-AT-HOME? GUESS WHAT.

19:18.282 --> 19:21.368
HER KIDS GROW UP AND MOVE OUT.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.412
THE UNDERSECRETARY OF COMMERCE

19:21.410 --> 19:23.412
OR WHATEVER?

19:23.454 --> 19:25.372
SHE GETS REPLACED BY

19:23.454 --> 19:25.372
THE NEXT ADMINISTRATION.

19:25.414 --> 19:28.084
AND THE THIRD ONE? I DON'T

19:25.414 --> 19:28.084
REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID SHE DID,

19:28.126 --> 19:30.419
SO LET'S JUST SAY

19:28.126 --> 19:30.419
SHE GETS HIT BY A BUS.

19:30.461 --> 19:33.213
THE POINT IS, THEIR STORIES ARE

19:30.461 --> 19:33.213
ALREADY WRITTEN.

19:33.255 --> 19:36.216
YOU ARE SITTING

19:33.255 --> 19:36.216
AT A FAME INTERVENTION

19:36.258 --> 19:38.511
NEXT TO A HOT-ASS HO

19:36.258 --> 19:38.511
PACKING A TRANQ GUN.

19:38.552 --> 19:41.097
DUDE, YOUR STORY IS

19:38.552 --> 19:41.097
JUST STARTING.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.224
THANKS.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.224
(Mark-Paul)

19:42.264 --> 19:44.224
YOU HAVE A GREAT BODY...

19:44.266 --> 19:45.726
(speaks indistinctly)

19:44.266 --> 19:45.726
THAT MEANS A LOT TO ME.

19:45.768 --> 19:47.145
SHUT UP.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.228
YOU NEED TO GET RID

19:48.270 --> 19:50.023
OF  EVERYTHING

19:48.270 --> 19:50.023
FROM YOUR DAWSON DAYS.

19:50.064 --> 19:53.026
IT'S KEEPING YOU

19:50.064 --> 19:53.026
FROM MOVING FORWARD.

19:53.067 --> 19:55.235
I SOLD

19:53.067 --> 19:55.235
MY BAYSIDE LETTERMAN JACKET.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.404
THAT'S HOW I BOUGHT

19:55.277 --> 19:57.404
MY HORSE CHA-CHA.

19:57.446 --> 20:00.282
OH, GOD. I LOVE HER SO MUCH.

20:00.324 --> 20:02.118
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.244
I-I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE IT

20:02.160 --> 20:04.244
U-UNTIL THIS HAPPENED--

20:04.286 --> 20:07.498
HOW MUCH TIME AND ENERGY I SPENT

20:04.286 --> 20:07.498
FOCUSED ON THAT PART OF MY LIFE.

20:09.125 --> 20:10.292
I NEED TO PURGE THE PAST.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.627
YOU'LL BE AMAZED

20:11.669 --> 20:13.212

20:16.757 --> 20:19.468
WHY ARE YOU SAYING THAT?

20:19.510 --> 20:22.429

20:22.471 --> 20:23.890
I DON'T KNOW.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.890
I JUST MADE IT UP.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.350
MY GHOSTWRITER, VIVIAN DANTE,

20:23.931 --> 20:26.350
MADE THAT UP.

20:26.392 --> 20:29.520
SHE ALSO RUNS MY TWITTER ACCOUNT

20:26.392 --> 20:29.520
ON SUNDAYS WHEN I RIDE CHA-CHA.
