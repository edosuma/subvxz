WEBVTT

00:09.910 --> 00:13.547
*

00:23.457 --> 00:27.628
* About as subtle
as an earthquake, I know *

00:27.661 --> 00:30.464
* My mistakes were made

00:30.498 --> 00:33.101
* For you

00:33.134 --> 00:37.338
* And in the back room
of a bad dream, she came *

00:37.371 --> 00:40.241
* And whisked me away

00:40.274 --> 00:42.343
* And confused

00:42.376 --> 00:45.479
* And it's as solid as a rock
rolling down a hill *

00:45.513 --> 00:48.616
* The fact is that
it probably will hit something *

00:48.649 --> 00:51.352
* On the hazardous terrain

00:51.385 --> 00:53.521
* And we're just
following the flock *

00:53.554 --> 00:55.856
* Around and in between,
before we're smashed *

00:55.889 --> 00:57.391
* To smithereens

00:57.425 --> 00:58.292
* Like they were

00:58.326 --> 01:00.728
* Then we scramble
from the blame *

01:00.761 --> 01:04.665
* And it's the fame
that put words in her mouth *

01:04.698 --> 01:07.468
* She couldn't help
but spit them out *

01:07.501 --> 01:09.503
* Innocence and arrogance

01:09.537 --> 01:11.105
* Entwined

01:11.139 --> 01:14.642
* In the filthiest of minds

01:14.675 --> 01:17.511
*

01:17.545 --> 01:19.813
* She was bitten

01:19.847 --> 01:22.350
* On her birthday, and now

01:22.383 --> 01:24.752
* A face in the crowd

01:24.785 --> 01:25.686
* She's not

01:28.356 --> 01:31.625
* And I suspected now
forever the shape *

01:31.659 --> 01:36.497
* She came to escape is forgot

01:36.530 --> 01:37.865
* And it's a lot

01:37.898 --> 01:40.301
* To ask her not to sting...

01:40.334 --> 01:42.170
(whispers): Not what
we're here for.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.671
* Around your
crooked conscience *

01:43.704 --> 01:45.373
* She will wind

01:45.406 --> 01:48.709
*

01:51.912 --> 01:53.514
Don't move.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.383
Put your hands
in the air and face

01:55.416 --> 01:56.250
the wall.

01:56.284 --> 01:58.352
Hands in the air,
and face the wall.

02:01.522 --> 02:02.823
(electrical crackling, grunting)

02:14.835 --> 02:16.904
Browner Dunn,
Diplomatic Security.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.472
Thank you
for responding.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.274
Don Eppes. Looks like
you got it covered here.

02:20.308 --> 02:21.775
Rooftop entry,
hacked security,

02:21.809 --> 02:22.776
and it sounds

02:22.810 --> 02:24.345
like a high-tech B-and-E.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.447
The Brazilian consulate
has two Andrades,

02:26.480 --> 02:27.381
a Portinaris,

02:27.415 --> 02:28.882
and a diamond collection
that rivals DeBeers.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.584
None of it
was touched.

02:30.618 --> 02:31.819
Your guy probably
scared 'em off.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.321
Where's he at?

02:33.354 --> 02:34.755
Yuson-- he was gone
when we got here.

02:34.788 --> 02:36.424
He hasn't checked in

02:36.457 --> 02:37.658
in 90 minutes.

02:37.691 --> 02:38.826
DAVID:
Any chance he was in on it?

02:38.859 --> 02:40.194
Not likely.

02:40.228 --> 02:41.762
The guy's a Boy Scout.

02:51.539 --> 02:54.242
They took out the main cameras.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.676
Whoever it is,
they have a blueprint

02:55.709 --> 02:57.745
on how to beat
a biometric security system.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.813
But not an attention to detail.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.282
I checked with the neighbors.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.551
Their garage camera covers
the hall window.

03:06.887 --> 03:07.955
That's Yuson.

03:07.988 --> 03:08.922
There's more.

03:16.897 --> 03:17.931
All right, so where is he?

03:23.637 --> 03:25.606
According to
the footage,

03:25.639 --> 03:26.840
this is the only place
they could have gone.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.642
They couldn't have
made Yuson disappear.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.646
(tapping)

03:32.680 --> 03:34.515
This painting is speaking to me.

03:35.749 --> 03:36.784
Listen.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.887
(tapping)

03:39.920 --> 03:42.623
Hey, does this
thing move?

03:52.833 --> 03:54.768
- How'd you...?
- It worked for Batman.

03:54.802 --> 03:56.937
DUNN: Looks like a voice
recognition trigger lock.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.472
DAVID:
FASR.

03:58.506 --> 03:59.640
Quantico's been testing
this thing.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.476
The lock responds to voice
passphrases from the owner.

04:02.510 --> 04:03.811
Consul Nespola's
been in Brazil,

04:03.844 --> 04:04.645
visiting his son.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.046
We haven't been able
to reach him.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.415
There's probably not
much air, right?

04:07.448 --> 04:09.049
NIKKI:
What about the vault designer?

04:09.082 --> 04:11.852
DAVID: No, that wouldn't help;
you need Nespola's voice.

04:11.885 --> 04:13.721
I'll call LAFD, have
them drill it open.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.489
Reinforced steel
versus a drill?

04:15.523 --> 04:16.524
Drill loses.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.359
You think we can pick it?

04:19.860 --> 04:21.595
CHARLIE:
You know, we don't need

04:21.629 --> 04:23.564
Nespola's vocal chords
to get his voice

04:23.597 --> 04:24.698
'cause he's a public figure.

04:24.732 --> 04:27.335
I've got 27,521 views
on YouTube.

04:27.368 --> 04:28.369
I...

04:28.402 --> 04:29.737
love... Rum-pel-stilt-skin.

04:29.770 --> 04:31.004
DAVID: That's an ocean
of clips, Charlie.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.774
How do we narrow that down
to a passphrase?

04:33.807 --> 04:35.776
I'm using a wavelet analysis

04:35.809 --> 04:37.778
to supersmooth
the rapid word combinations.

04:37.811 --> 04:39.747
The English language has
44 phonemes,

04:39.780 --> 04:42.450
which are sounds inherent
in human speech,

04:42.483 --> 04:43.784
and that's
what voice recognition

04:43.817 --> 04:44.885
is based on.

04:44.918 --> 04:45.886
God-zill-a... grew...

04:45.919 --> 04:48.722
up... in the favelas.

04:48.756 --> 04:49.523
So it keys on the
sounds within words

04:49.557 --> 04:50.691
instead of the
words themselves?

04:50.724 --> 04:51.592
CHARLIE:
And all we need is

04:51.625 --> 04:54.462
the right combination
within those 44.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.566
NESPOLA: God... honor...
country... futbol.

04:58.599 --> 04:59.567
CHARLIE:
It's like walking

04:59.600 --> 05:01.869
into a junkyard...

05:01.902 --> 05:04.104
and you're surrounded by dozens

05:04.137 --> 05:07.541
of cars that no longer run,

05:07.575 --> 05:10.378
so you start collecting parts--

05:10.411 --> 05:13.647
carburetors, radiators,
pistons, transmissions.

05:13.681 --> 05:16.049
You clean 'em off, you see
which parts still function,

05:16.083 --> 05:17.317
you put 'em together,

05:17.351 --> 05:21.589
mixing and matching until you
find a combination that runs.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.625
NESPOLA:
Goody...

05:24.658 --> 05:26.727
good-y... two... shoes.

05:27.795 --> 05:28.796
Yeah, you got it.

05:28.829 --> 05:29.897
(whirring)

05:31.131 --> 05:32.800
Oh, my God.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.034
DON:
You all right?

05:34.067 --> 05:35.803
DUNN: I'm gonna take
this off...

05:35.836 --> 05:37.771
YUSON:
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.378
Let me get this straight.

05:44.412 --> 05:47.481
You pass up paintings
and diamonds for...

05:47.515 --> 05:48.882
Sneakers?

05:59.159 --> 06:02.162
All right, I can understand
stealing gold, stealing art,

06:02.195 --> 06:04.398
but who pulls a
heist for shoes?

06:04.432 --> 06:05.766
Who keeps 'em in a vault?

06:05.799 --> 06:07.535
This Consul Nespola dude's
got to be

06:07.568 --> 06:08.536
a hard-core shoe collector.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.538
Look, I know guys
who stand in line for days

06:10.571 --> 06:11.572
for a pair of kicks.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.006
You're kidding
me-- for shoes?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.408
Aren't you the
guy with, like,

06:14.442 --> 06:15.509
35,000 comic books?

06:15.543 --> 06:17.511
He's got
dead stock Waffles,

06:17.545 --> 06:18.712
Micropacers,

06:18.746 --> 06:20.681
So-Cal Exclusives.
A collection

06:20.714 --> 06:22.416
like this has got
to be worth millions.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.184
Look, kicks

06:24.217 --> 06:25.453
are status symbols.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.754
All right?
You live in Malibu,

06:26.787 --> 06:27.955
you drive a Maserati.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.890
You live on Slauson,
you wear Jordans.

06:29.923 --> 06:30.958
How do you know
so much about it?

06:30.991 --> 06:32.493
I got a four-year degree from

06:32.526 --> 06:34.061
the streets of Compton and
Watts.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.730
Yeah, but they stole one pair.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.632
Judging from
what they left behind,

06:38.666 --> 06:39.767
they're something special.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.635
All right, well, thieves
are not complicated, right?

06:41.669 --> 06:42.603
I mean, somebody hired them

06:42.636 --> 06:44.204
or the shoes are headed
for the black market.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.205
Yeah, either way,
we got

06:45.238 --> 06:47.575
about 24 hours
before the sneakers get moved.

06:47.608 --> 06:48.576
(door opens)

06:48.609 --> 06:50.644
Consul Nespola's here.

06:50.678 --> 06:52.746
All the guy talks about
is shoes.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.049
These right here--

06:56.083 --> 06:57.885
vintage Brazilian Adidas.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.654
Paid $300 for 'em,
sold 'em for $5,000.

07:00.688 --> 07:02.155
This is the new
stock market.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.957
Oil-- unreliable,

07:03.991 --> 07:05.726
real estate--
in the toilet.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.994
But in shoes you trust?

07:07.027 --> 07:10.798
Listen, I go after big paydays--
made my fortune in junk bonds--

07:10.831 --> 07:12.600
but before I was consul,

07:12.633 --> 07:14.602
I was a kid
who couldn't afford sneakers,

07:14.635 --> 07:15.836
and now I can, so I do.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.639
You got a picture of the ones
that were stolen, by any chance?

07:18.672 --> 07:20.508
(scoffs)

07:20.541 --> 07:23.577
Picture of every pair.
Uh...

07:23.611 --> 07:24.978
(clearing throat):
Okay,

07:25.012 --> 07:28.015
these are the 2-K Primers.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.017
Oh, yeah,
I know Primers.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.485
My brother wanted a pair
when we were kids.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.754
- Mm.
- Parents paid rent instead.

07:33.787 --> 07:34.888
(chuckles)
What's so special about these?

07:34.922 --> 07:36.624
What's so...?

07:36.657 --> 07:37.357
Give me that.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.492
This is
the very first pair

07:38.526 --> 07:41.629
of the Final Edition Primers
off the assembly line--

07:41.662 --> 07:43.030
serial number 001.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.532
(groans)

07:44.565 --> 07:45.533
That means

07:45.566 --> 07:47.067
I paid $250,000

07:47.100 --> 07:48.168
for these
at auction.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.903
Do you have any idea
what they're going to be worth

07:49.937 --> 07:51.104
in five years?
No,

07:51.138 --> 07:53.541
and I don't really care, but
I do notice that you bought

07:53.574 --> 07:54.508
most of them in the last year.
Is that true?

07:54.542 --> 07:55.776
Well, what I lack

07:55.809 --> 07:57.778
in experience, I make up
for in aggressiveness.

07:57.811 --> 07:58.779
Well, that
can't make

07:58.812 --> 07:59.847
the other collectors happy.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.615
Oh, the other collectors

08:01.649 --> 08:03.551
can kiss my Converse because
no one was supposed to know

08:03.584 --> 08:04.384
I had these Primers.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.587
That auction
was allegedly closed.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.021
Who was in charge of the sale?

08:08.055 --> 08:10.958
La-La Buendia--
works for 2-K Shoes.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.661
DON:
Hey, congratulations

08:13.694 --> 08:15.663
on that promotion.

08:15.696 --> 08:18.298
Yeah, Supervisor
of Organized Crime.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.768
I head to Denver
at the end of the week.

08:20.801 --> 08:23.236
Yeah, it's cold there.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.938
It's a great department.
Yeah?

08:24.972 --> 08:25.939
Great opportunity.

08:25.973 --> 08:28.676
All right.

08:28.709 --> 08:29.509
So, stealing shoes has

08:29.543 --> 08:31.712
young and dumb written
all over it,

08:31.745 --> 08:33.814
but your thieves manipulated
voice recognition.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.315
So maybe someone shares
their MO?

08:35.348 --> 08:36.584
Yeah,

08:36.617 --> 08:38.051
why don't you run
it by Charlie?

08:38.085 --> 08:40.754
Find a heuristic
that'll cut down the time?

08:40.788 --> 08:43.156
I don't know, maybe you
have been here too long.

08:43.190 --> 08:44.825
* Hey, is you ridin' with me?

08:44.858 --> 08:47.194
* You want this money,
let's get it *

08:47.227 --> 08:49.697
* If you're down for me,
I ain't funny, I'm committed *

08:49.730 --> 08:52.600
* Don't be lying to me,
all I wanna do is get it *

08:52.633 --> 08:55.135
* Hey, little mama, you
should let me be your daddy *

08:55.168 --> 08:56.637
* Is you ridin' with me?

08:56.670 --> 08:58.305
* You want this money,
let's get it... *

08:58.338 --> 09:01.141
Who knew that shoes could
bring the world together?

09:01.174 --> 09:02.643
Just do not step
on anyone's feet.

09:02.676 --> 09:03.644
Whoa, whoa,

09:03.677 --> 09:04.612
whoa, whoa, what's up?

09:04.645 --> 09:06.580
Hey, if you're here for
the Primer bracelets,

09:06.614 --> 09:07.648
y'all need to get in line.

09:07.681 --> 09:08.616
You don't let us
inside,

09:08.649 --> 09:09.750
you're gonna be
the one wearing bracelets.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.686
What do the bracelets get you?

09:12.720 --> 09:15.088
Final Edition Primers drop
on the general public in a week.

09:15.122 --> 09:16.824
Everybody and their
moms is trying to cop.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.626
Once the first pair
auctioned off for crazy money,

09:18.659 --> 09:20.628
I guess the demand for these
went through the roof.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.596
These priority bracelets--
they keep people

09:22.630 --> 09:24.231
from mobbing each other
on the day of release?

09:24.264 --> 09:26.600
Yeah.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.869
I mean, it only raises the
hype, though, you know?

09:30.804 --> 09:33.841
You want a discount,
yo, I can hook it up.

09:39.680 --> 09:41.081
Hey.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.082
Sorry I'm late.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.216
That's okay.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.754
Amita had a combinatorics
symposium in Kansas City.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.789
I had a lecture
on synchronized chaos,

09:48.822 --> 09:50.190
which is not at all meant
for one person.

09:50.223 --> 09:52.192
What's the required reading?

09:52.225 --> 09:54.695
Well, I checked with
our audio guys in Virginia,

09:54.728 --> 09:57.030
and the bank's have been using
voice recognition technology

09:57.064 --> 09:58.031
for the past
few years.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.132
It looks
like an imposing list

09:59.166 --> 10:00.634
of suspects

10:00.668 --> 10:02.169
if we're simply considering
bank heists.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.737
You know?
Epic.

10:03.771 --> 10:04.838
Yeah, well,

10:04.872 --> 10:07.641
an epic search calls
for an epic search algorithm.

10:07.675 --> 10:12.079
It'll, uh, it'll sort
suspects into segments.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.783
(typing)

10:17.685 --> 10:18.585
* Is you ridin' with me?

10:18.618 --> 10:20.087
* You want this money,
let's get it *

10:20.120 --> 10:21.755
* If you're down for me,
I ain't funny... *

10:21.789 --> 10:23.757
So, Ms. Buendia,

10:23.791 --> 10:25.726
you were running the auction
for 2-K Shoes,

10:25.759 --> 10:27.394
and Nespola said
no one was supposed to know

10:27.427 --> 10:28.762
the identity
of the winning bidder.

10:28.796 --> 10:29.830
Look, this was an auction

10:29.863 --> 10:31.799
for the first pair
of the Final Edition Primers.

10:31.832 --> 10:34.001
Word was gonna get
out, regardless.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.769
Nespola's a jerk.

10:35.803 --> 10:38.706
Any idea who
stole his shoes?

10:38.739 --> 10:40.207
Every head in L.A.
wants that heat.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.875
Me?

10:41.909 --> 10:43.410
paid until they're found.t get

10:43.443 --> 10:44.912
What do you mean?

10:44.945 --> 10:46.847
Well, Nespola froze
his auction payment

10:46.880 --> 10:48.315
until the shoes are found.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.751
That means no
commission for me.

10:50.784 --> 10:51.985
On a quarter million
dollar sale,

10:52.019 --> 10:53.420
you do the math.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.088
Thing about Nespola
winning the auction

10:55.122 --> 10:56.857
is that everyone else lost.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.792
Leaves a lot of angry bidders.

10:58.826 --> 11:00.327
Well, bidding
did get hot and heavy

11:00.360 --> 11:02.996
between Nespola
and Bit O' Nutz.

11:03.030 --> 11:04.331
Who?

11:04.364 --> 11:05.766
DJ Bit O' Nutz.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.768
The only sneakerhead
with a collection

11:07.801 --> 11:09.803
bigger than Nespola's.

11:09.837 --> 11:11.805
(giggling)

11:11.839 --> 11:13.240
Oh, right there,
right there, right there.

11:13.273 --> 11:14.875
(sighs)
Yeah, girl.

11:14.908 --> 11:17.110
Go a little lower--
that's right.

11:17.144 --> 11:18.912
Daddy got a lot of stress
down there, girl.

11:18.946 --> 11:20.781
All right.

11:20.814 --> 11:22.315
(sighs)
Come on, man.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.184
This is not what I call
a happy ending.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.754
We'd like to talk to
you for a few minutes.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.957
- What's up, Buster Brown?
- Buster Brown?

11:29.990 --> 11:31.959
Well, you know, they
say kicks say a lot

11:31.992 --> 11:35.162
about a man, and, uh, yours
are screaming, "Supercop!"

11:35.195 --> 11:36.797
So, you're
Vic Moritz?

11:36.830 --> 11:37.898
Is that right?

11:37.931 --> 11:39.767
I prefer...

11:39.800 --> 11:41.769
Bit O' Nutz.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.773
* You gotta, gotta be

11:45.806 --> 11:47.808
* A Bit O' Nutz
in this world, world. *

11:50.243 --> 11:51.311
My hit single.

11:51.344 --> 11:52.880
DAVID:
What's nuts

11:52.913 --> 11:54.915
is you bidding six figures
on a pair of shoes.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.516
Man, you can't argue with that.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.018
That's love.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.753
Look, I know
everything there is

11:59.787 --> 12:00.854
to know about
Primers.

12:00.888 --> 12:03.791
It all started
with Primer Nelson.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.793
Busted ankle ended
his playing days in the league,

12:05.826 --> 12:08.195
so he made kicks
to prevent injuries to others.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.830
You mix tech
with fashion, and...

12:09.863 --> 12:11.832
bong! Primers became a
phenomenon.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.934
Vic, we didn't really come here
for a history lesson.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.869
Yeah, but it's
who I am, baby.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.771
I mean, I produced
my first single

12:17.805 --> 12:19.372
to buy a pair of Primers.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.841
So, you must
have been ticked off

12:20.874 --> 12:21.775
when Nespola
got the Final Editions.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.476
Hey, man, I'm not going to lie.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.478
I mean, those kicks
are my grails,

12:25.512 --> 12:26.914
but I don't
need to steal

12:26.947 --> 12:28.782
from a reseller like Nespola.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.117
Mind if we take a look in here?

12:30.150 --> 12:31.551
Fine. Excuse me.

12:31.584 --> 12:34.988
* You gotta be
a Bit O' Nutz in this world. *

12:35.022 --> 12:37.825
(chiming)

12:37.858 --> 12:40.794
Hey, go ahead,
toss my crib if you want.

12:40.828 --> 12:42.996
I ain't got
nothing to hide.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.565
But you are not gonna find
any Final Edition Primers here.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.200
So, is that why you sent
threatening e-mails

12:47.234 --> 12:48.401
to Nespola and La-La Buendia?

12:48.435 --> 12:51.271
Look, man, I felt cheated,

12:51.304 --> 12:54.107
so I sent a message.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.876
Look, as you can see,
I am more intimidating

12:55.909 --> 12:57.377
in an e-mail
than I am in person.

12:58.946 --> 13:00.413
It's not about
the money for me.

13:00.447 --> 13:01.548
Oh, no?

13:01.581 --> 13:02.983
No.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.952
They say love...

13:04.985 --> 13:07.320
is putting on
a fresh pair every day.

13:08.989 --> 13:09.990
That's me.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.224
I mean, ask around, man.

13:11.258 --> 13:13.060
I mean, my
reputation is nice.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.862
I can't say that for Nespola.

13:17.564 --> 13:18.431
CHARLIE:
So, looks like we're down

13:18.465 --> 13:21.101
to dueling lists of
12 suspects here,

13:21.134 --> 13:23.103
thanks to the power
of efficiency

13:23.136 --> 13:26.940
through optimized
searching.

13:26.974 --> 13:29.342
I'm sorry, I'm kind of
nerding out on you.

13:29.376 --> 13:32.012
Oh, no,
I was just, uh...

13:32.045 --> 13:34.547
I was having one
of those reflective moments.

13:36.083 --> 13:39.519
Hey, Denver is
lucky to have you.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.221
That's... that's what
they say, right?

13:41.254 --> 13:44.024
It is a great
opportunity.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.526
It's a promotion.

13:46.559 --> 13:47.627
Urban nomads are the
last great adventurers.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.497
You know, I was just a kid
when I got to Princeton.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.465
Charlie,
when you graduated

13:52.499 --> 13:54.067
from Princeton,
you were just a kid.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.070
No, what I'm saying
is, is that

13:57.104 --> 13:58.338
you really never learn more
about yourself

13:58.371 --> 14:02.175
than when you're on your own,
when you're away from family.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.377
That's true.

14:04.411 --> 14:06.446
Not everyone
has a family like that.

14:08.581 --> 14:10.918
(typing)

14:13.553 --> 14:15.255
DAVID: You know,
I'm just saying,

14:15.288 --> 14:16.990
I don't even wear Buster
Browns, you know?

14:17.024 --> 14:18.425
Does it matter?

14:18.458 --> 14:19.659
No, but you know how much
I paid for these?

14:19.692 --> 14:20.660
MAN:
Betancourt.

14:20.693 --> 14:21.661
(chuckling):
Cates.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.996
- How you doing?
- What's up?

14:23.030 --> 14:23.830
This is
David Sinclair.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.266
Nice to meet you.
I saw your name

14:26.299 --> 14:28.568
on the alerts for
that consulate heist.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.371
Come on, check this out.

14:31.404 --> 14:32.605
Guy runs through here.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.341
He gets this.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.180
All right, but how does
that connect to us?

14:47.587 --> 14:48.655
You wear 250 G's

14:48.688 --> 14:50.223
on your feet
in skid row,

14:50.257 --> 14:51.491
you're looking
to get jacked.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.360
Yeah, but who gets
jacked for one shoe?

15:04.271 --> 15:07.440
Our Cinderfella has no ID,
but prison tats.

15:07.474 --> 15:09.576
The techs think
Eastern European.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.245
All right, run his photo,
get it to immigration.

15:12.279 --> 15:13.480
Okay, any description
of the shooter?

15:13.513 --> 15:15.115
Witnesses say
a white guy in his 20s.

15:15.148 --> 15:16.349
He argued
with our dead guy

15:16.383 --> 15:17.217
before chasing him
down here.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.585
Literally chased him
out of his shoe.

15:18.618 --> 15:20.020
I thought breaking a heel
was bad.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.054
Yeah, first thing
our killer did

15:21.088 --> 15:23.323
was go for the shoe,
but a crowd of looky-loos,

15:23.356 --> 15:25.192
they scared him off
before he got to it.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.426
NIKKI: Chased away by
the bum brigade?

15:26.459 --> 15:28.695
Forensics is working on prints.

15:28.728 --> 15:31.031
They can't find
the other shoe?

15:31.064 --> 15:32.665
On this street, shiny new things
tend to disappear quickly.

15:32.699 --> 15:33.733
(phone ringing)

15:33.766 --> 15:35.468
Yeah, Betancourt.

15:37.570 --> 15:38.638
Okay.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.107
Yeah, great.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.608
Yeah, that was Liz and Charlie.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.043
They think they found
a possible match

15:43.076 --> 15:44.311
on the MO
from our consulate heist.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.378
I can't wait

15:45.412 --> 15:46.646
to meet the guy that hacks

15:46.679 --> 15:48.181
voice recognition locks
for a living.

15:48.215 --> 15:50.150
Interpol says his
name is Stephanois.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.151
(laughs)

15:51.184 --> 15:54.421
He's French, too.

15:54.454 --> 15:55.555
LIZ:
Your rap sheet reads

15:55.588 --> 15:58.025
like an encyclopedia
for thieves.

15:58.058 --> 15:59.726
MAN:
And...

15:59.759 --> 16:01.328
I made a fortune.

16:01.361 --> 16:04.197
Alas, all good things

16:04.231 --> 16:05.165
come to an end.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.000
Then again,
a rendezvous

16:07.034 --> 16:08.735
with two charming damsels...

16:08.768 --> 16:10.670
always a pleasure.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.539
Yeah, you know what
really makes us hot?

16:13.706 --> 16:16.776
Stories about biometric
security.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.746
I pulled diamond heists
in Paris,

16:19.779 --> 16:21.214
art in Monaco...

16:21.248 --> 16:23.550
Yeah, but see,
that's the thing about heists.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.152
Sooner or later, you get caught.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.686
Which is why
I embrace

16:26.719 --> 16:30.190
the peace and quiet
of retirement.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.624
Interpol says you adjusted
your game.

16:31.658 --> 16:32.725
Internet theft,

16:32.759 --> 16:34.294
hacking speech
recognition locks

16:34.327 --> 16:36.129
on bank computers.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.530
(chuckling)

16:37.564 --> 16:38.798
Taking the
life savings

16:38.831 --> 16:41.534
of soccer moms was a tad banal.

16:41.568 --> 16:42.635
Is that why

16:42.669 --> 16:43.670
you switched it up again?

16:43.703 --> 16:45.105
You know,
lifting sneakers

16:45.138 --> 16:48.308
from Randall Nespola.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.244
Last night, I was having dinner
with my parole officer.

16:52.379 --> 16:53.380
Steak was overcooked.

16:53.413 --> 16:56.083
And I would never
soil my craft

16:56.116 --> 16:58.551
heisting something as trivial...

16:58.585 --> 17:00.320
as tennis shoes.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.588
Six-figure shoes

17:01.621 --> 17:03.223
aren't so trivial.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.324
Low six

17:04.357 --> 17:06.626
or high six?

17:11.098 --> 17:12.165
You buy it?

17:12.199 --> 17:13.166
Well, let's see.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.303
Extremely rare skill set,
lifelong criminal.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.071
Maybe there's a connection
to Mr. One Shoe?

17:18.105 --> 17:19.439
I'll check.

17:19.472 --> 17:21.074
You want to see
if anyone tried

17:21.108 --> 17:22.309
to fence the shoes
to other bidders?

17:22.342 --> 17:24.111
Yeah, sure.

17:24.144 --> 17:25.145
Hey.

17:25.178 --> 17:26.446
I heard you're
leaving me

17:26.479 --> 17:28.148
to fend for myself
in the boys club.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.416
Yeah.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.151
That's good for you.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.486
Boss of your
own unit.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.288
But you'll be missed
around here.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.290
Thanks... and I think

17:37.324 --> 17:38.791
you're doing all right
in the boys club.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.860
Nah, girl, I'm just trying
to be like you.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.329
(chuckling)

17:42.362 --> 17:43.863
ALAN:
Did you ever notice

17:43.896 --> 17:46.199
how Professor Elliot
resembles a cobra?

17:46.233 --> 17:48.468
LARRY: Uh, psoriasis,
hoodlike neck,

17:48.501 --> 17:49.802
bites when angry.

17:49.836 --> 17:50.937
Yeah, okay, I can see it.

17:50.970 --> 17:53.406
CHARLIE: You were late to solid
state physics lab again?

17:53.440 --> 17:55.275
By three minutes--
I mean, he locks the doors.

17:55.308 --> 17:57.477
I'll never get my
lab hours at this rate.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.512
You know, Charles, there
are other labs

17:59.546 --> 18:01.414
that would fulfill
your dad's requirement.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.116
Oh, yeah.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.285
Computation and neural systems,
for example.

18:05.318 --> 18:06.519
- Exactly.
- Fine, fine.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.755
As long as the professors
aren't asses.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.590
- You're looking at them.
- You... you...?

18:10.623 --> 18:11.724
(knock at door)

18:11.758 --> 18:13.626
Ah, there he is.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.262
How's the great
sneaker caper?

18:15.295 --> 18:17.330
Well, the good news
is we found the right one.

18:17.364 --> 18:18.198
Congrats.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.300
But the left one was lost,
apparently

18:20.333 --> 18:22.135
somewhere
in skid row.

18:22.169 --> 18:23.803
Ah, all right, so...

18:23.836 --> 18:25.805
we're talking about
an item that's been

18:25.838 --> 18:27.340
misplaced in an area

18:27.374 --> 18:29.309
where its value
has yet to be determined,

18:29.342 --> 18:30.410
so...

18:30.443 --> 18:33.380
You know what, get us a
layout of the crime scene,

18:33.413 --> 18:35.148
and we can run

18:35.182 --> 18:36.383
an a priori probability

18:36.416 --> 18:38.285
distribution search,
which won't tell you

18:38.318 --> 18:39.452
where the shoe
was picked up,

18:39.486 --> 18:40.820
but it will give you
search zones.

18:40.853 --> 18:42.655
Well, that sounds
like a lot of work

18:42.689 --> 18:43.690
for sneakers.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.158
Just give me a pair of Bubbas.

18:45.192 --> 18:46.826
LARRY: I'm not familiar with
that brand.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.328
Bubbas?

18:48.361 --> 18:49.629
They're a reference to a variety
of generic brands,

18:49.662 --> 18:51.464
like cheap sneakers.

18:51.498 --> 18:53.333
Great for a fifth grader,
quantity-wise.

18:53.366 --> 18:54.601
Not so great aesthetically.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.736
Right, hence my having to wear
golf shoes for Little League.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.538
Hey, hey, hey.

18:58.571 --> 19:01.241
You were lucky
you didn't go barefoot.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.909
You know, in an area
like skid row,

19:02.942 --> 19:04.877
where no one
knows the difference

19:04.911 --> 19:05.912
between Bubbas
and Primers,

19:05.945 --> 19:07.247
the preference for shoes

19:07.280 --> 19:08.481
balances between need

19:08.515 --> 19:09.649
and aesthetic value.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.884
Sounds like "Shipwrecks
and Sneakers."

19:11.918 --> 19:14.354
- What's that?
- It's a true story.

19:14.387 --> 19:17.624
The vessel Hansa was en route
from Korea to Portland,

19:17.657 --> 19:20.493
when it lost all these crates
of sneakers overboard.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.329
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I read about that.

19:22.362 --> 19:25.265
from Oregon to Hawaiin shores

19:25.298 --> 19:27.700
in a pattern, depending on what
the brands were,

19:27.734 --> 19:29.536
or whether they were rights
or lefts.

19:29.569 --> 19:31.371
And scientists
used the flow pattern

19:31.404 --> 19:33.573
to trace the shoes back
to the spill site.

19:33.606 --> 19:34.541
DON:
Is this gonna

19:34.574 --> 19:36.276
get us anywhere,
or are we just digressing?

19:36.309 --> 19:38.445
When do I ever digress?

19:46.686 --> 19:47.854
Thanks.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.458
Hey, thanks for
making the time.

19:51.491 --> 19:52.759
We need to
know if either

19:52.792 --> 19:54.361
of these faces
look familiar.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.662
Uh, maybe one of them

19:55.695 --> 19:56.663
sniffed around,
trying to get

19:56.696 --> 19:59.766
contact info off of one
of the auction bidders.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.436
Never seen either one.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.707
Um...

20:07.740 --> 20:10.477
look, yesterday, maybe
I came off wrong.

20:10.510 --> 20:11.811
The thing is,

20:11.844 --> 20:14.314
that commission
is my seed money.

20:14.347 --> 20:15.782
Future site of my company,

20:15.815 --> 20:17.016
once I leave
2-K Shoes.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.485
Oh, man,

20:18.518 --> 20:20.453
I haven't seen anything in here

20:20.487 --> 20:22.355
since TJ's Drug Store
cleared out.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.657
I used to patrol the area.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.659
Well, it'd be nice
to bring business back.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.695
You know, give
some people jobs.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.597
Make some affordable hot kicks.

20:30.630 --> 20:31.731
Affordable and hot?

20:31.764 --> 20:32.965
That's not an easy combination.

20:32.999 --> 20:34.200
Yeah.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.936
But it's more fulfilling than
selling shoes that nobody wears.

20:36.969 --> 20:40.039
Yeah, I got you.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.609
So, no one approached you
about any of the bidders?

20:42.642 --> 20:44.644
No.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.980
But I did get a call after the
auction about the bid amounts.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.949
The guy didn't
leave his name

20:49.982 --> 20:51.918
and I didn't give any numbers.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.955
LIZ:
La-La gets a call

20:55.988 --> 20:57.490
about the bid amounts,

20:57.524 --> 20:59.726
probably gauging a market value
for fencing the shoes.

20:59.759 --> 21:00.927
NIKKI:
So we did a dump

21:00.960 --> 21:01.961
on La-La's phone.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.663
And we traced
a call to a guy

21:03.696 --> 21:05.932
who matches the description
of our skid row shooter.

21:05.965 --> 21:07.734
NIKKI: Lee Diddums.
Popped for a GTA.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.436
Liquor store holdups
before that.

21:09.469 --> 21:10.737
LIZ: And Johnny Knoxville
stays busy.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.439
He's minor league.

21:12.472 --> 21:13.806
Yeah, that's what I thought,

21:13.840 --> 21:16.075
until I looked
at his earlier jobs.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.911
using audio files.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.713
LIZ: He was juvie
at the time.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.048
That's why he wasn't
in our records.

21:22.081 --> 21:23.783
And during his time in juvie
he had a visitor.

21:23.816 --> 21:24.817
Jean Stephanois.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.553
Diddums is his kid?

21:26.586 --> 21:27.920
No, his nephew.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.822
Mother's maiden name
is Stephanois.

21:29.856 --> 21:32.091
That apple fell far from the
tree and rolled down the hill?

21:32.124 --> 21:33.593
All right, put an APB on him.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.762
And let's interview
Stephanois again.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.397
ICE ID'd
our dead guy.

21:37.430 --> 21:38.631
He's Ekin Zetroc.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.433
He's Albanian,
in the country illegally.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.501
I have an address.

21:41.534 --> 21:43.903
- I am going inside!
- You have no business here.

21:43.936 --> 21:46.673
And look who shows up
at the dead Albanian's house.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.908
- No, they're mine!
- Yeah, say that again!

21:48.941 --> 21:50.743
No, no, get out
of my life!

21:50.777 --> 21:51.978
What am I,
your woman now?

21:52.011 --> 21:53.746
(overlapping chatter)

21:53.780 --> 21:56.483
If you're taking bets,
I got to go with Nespola.

21:56.516 --> 21:58.551
Get back in your little car
and go home, my man.

21:58.585 --> 21:59.519
We got the same car!

21:59.552 --> 22:01.721
I don't know.
Bit O' Nutz could surprise.

22:01.754 --> 22:03.122
Why am I talking
to you?

22:03.155 --> 22:04.724
You gonna hide behind your
emails?

22:04.757 --> 22:06.426
Know why they call me Nutz?
'Cause I'm about to

22:06.459 --> 22:07.927
go loco on you
right now!

22:07.960 --> 22:09.862
Hey, hey, save it
for the Octagon...

22:09.896 --> 22:11.030
(arguing)

22:11.063 --> 22:11.964
Is that right?

22:11.998 --> 22:12.799
Aren't your bankrolls
a little too large

22:12.832 --> 22:13.666
to be duking it out
on the street?

22:13.700 --> 22:16.503
I got a call from
some guy in there.

22:16.536 --> 22:19.472
He's offering to sell
my Primers back to me.

22:19.506 --> 22:20.840
Yeah, and I got the same
call, but no one showed.

22:20.873 --> 22:22.442
It's hard to show when
you're dead, all right?

22:22.475 --> 22:24.110
Looks like our Albanian
was trying

22:24.143 --> 22:25.111
to set up
a bidding war.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.813
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's that?

22:26.846 --> 22:27.514
You find my Primers?

22:27.547 --> 22:29.682
We're halfway
there, okay?

22:29.716 --> 22:30.717
Listen, you spend that
much on shoes,

22:30.750 --> 22:32.351
they should stay on your feet.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.423
- He wore them?!
- He wore them?!

22:36.456 --> 22:39.358
- That ruins the value!
- That ruins the value!

22:42.194 --> 22:43.996
Things are looking
worse for Diddums.

22:44.030 --> 22:45.532
Forensics came back
on the gun.

22:45.565 --> 22:47.033
He killed our skid
row stiff, Zetroc.

22:47.066 --> 22:48.635
Yeah. Anything
with the APB?

22:48.668 --> 22:49.769
No, nothing yet.

22:49.802 --> 22:51.471
We combed Zetroc's
place.

22:51.504 --> 22:52.739
Nothing there but
Albanian junk,

22:52.772 --> 22:54.140
so we grabbed his cell
phone records.

22:54.173 --> 22:56.008
Traced the calls he made
to Nespola and Moritz.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.444
And according to
our interface,

22:57.477 --> 22:58.811
came from a warehouse
on skid row.

22:58.845 --> 23:00.847
All right, get on it.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.770
FBI!
Don't move!

23:23.803 --> 23:25.538
I got him!

23:46.826 --> 23:48.027
Hey!

23:48.060 --> 23:49.462
Get back here!

23:50.697 --> 23:51.631
Hey!

23:51.664 --> 23:52.665
Hold it!

23:52.699 --> 23:54.200
Don't! Don't!

24:01.808 --> 24:04.076
Nice jump.

24:04.110 --> 24:05.612
NIKKI:
Gotta be the shoes.

24:05.645 --> 24:07.580
(both panting)

24:11.918 --> 24:13.019
Yeah.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.187
But which ones?

24:25.732 --> 24:27.867
Diddums tied them up.
Left 'em in a back room.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.101
Stylish crew.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.003
I thought that general release
date wasn't until next week.

24:31.037 --> 24:32.705
NIKKI: Hey, why wait when you
can make your own?

24:32.739 --> 24:33.840
Counterfeiters.

24:33.873 --> 24:36.275
Use a mold from an authentic
pair to make knockoffs.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.277
So, everyone here's Albanian,

24:38.310 --> 24:40.613
same as our dead
friend Zetroc.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.181
Any idea what Diddums
was searching for?

24:42.214 --> 24:43.616
No, no one knows,
but they've seen him before.

24:43.650 --> 24:44.250
He met with their bosses.

24:44.283 --> 24:46.853
Bosses?

24:46.886 --> 24:48.955
Ekin Zetroc, and that guy...

24:48.988 --> 24:51.223
Nadroj Ria.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.762
RIA:
I didn't know

24:55.795 --> 24:57.697
Zetroc.

24:57.730 --> 24:58.731
Really?

24:58.765 --> 25:00.533
You know Albania, right?

25:00.567 --> 25:01.433
Nice labor camps.

25:01.467 --> 25:03.135
Makes Chino look
like Chuck E. Cheese.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.904
NIKKI: Immigration'll make sure
you meet up with

25:04.937 --> 25:06.839
your old friends.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.945
I'd rather do prison here
than go back there.

25:12.979 --> 25:15.181
All right, start talking.

25:15.214 --> 25:17.049
Diddums stole a pair

25:17.083 --> 25:19.552
of Final Edition Primers
from some rich guy.

25:19.586 --> 25:21.187
We paid him $20,000

25:21.220 --> 25:22.855
to borrow the shoes
for a few hours...

25:22.889 --> 25:24.691
Make molds,
take pictures.

25:24.724 --> 25:27.126
We can knock out 100
counterfeits in a day.

25:27.159 --> 25:29.862
But the other part--
that was Zetroc's idea.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.197
The other part?

25:32.264 --> 25:34.333
Switch the shoes on Diddums,

25:34.366 --> 25:35.768
give him counterfeits.

25:35.802 --> 25:38.838
theft deserves another.good

25:38.871 --> 25:40.707
Zetroc said he could auction off
the real pair.

25:40.740 --> 25:43.710
But Diddums killed
him first.

25:43.743 --> 25:46.312
So, what was Diddums doing at
the warehouse when we arrived?

25:48.280 --> 25:50.783
The Primers Zetroc was wearing
were knockoffs, too.

25:50.817 --> 25:52.118
Now he was going

25:52.151 --> 25:53.085
back for the real ones.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.588
We might be crooks,
but we're not stupid.

25:55.622 --> 25:57.924
So where are
the originals?

26:02.094 --> 26:04.130
Your nephew's a killer.

26:04.163 --> 26:06.065
Lee can barely

26:06.098 --> 26:08.100
wipe his backside
without screwing up,

26:08.134 --> 26:10.637
much less commit murder.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.138
You didn't tell us
pulling heists

26:12.171 --> 26:13.673
was a family business.

26:13.706 --> 26:14.807
My nephew is on...

26:14.841 --> 26:18.377
the shallow end
of the gene pool.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.747
How about laying low,
you teach him that?

26:20.780 --> 26:23.049
Is there anything
in my history

26:23.082 --> 26:26.085
that suggests this kind
of buffoonery?

26:26.118 --> 26:29.656
I once owned a place in Tahiti.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.891
Had I made
that score,

26:31.924 --> 26:35.895
I'd be there right now,
surrounded with beauties.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.864
Well, you can think
about that.

26:39.866 --> 26:41.300
Call me crazy,
but I believe him.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.302
So we find the
damn Primers,

26:43.335 --> 26:45.037
we'll catch him.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.679
easy to find a needlehim: not

26:52.712 --> 26:55.181
in a needle stack.

26:55.214 --> 26:57.349
Especially when the only guy who
knows which is which is dead.

26:57.383 --> 26:59.218
Man, I know everything
about these kicks

26:59.251 --> 27:01.320
and I can't tell
the difference.

27:01.353 --> 27:03.255
That's funny, considering a real
one costs ten times as much.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.124
NIKKI: Yeah, tried
weighing 'em.

27:05.157 --> 27:06.926
Every sneaker's the same
15 ounces.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.861
CHARLIE: All right,
hot off the presses:

27:08.895 --> 27:11.330
the results from my skid row
distribution search.

27:11.363 --> 27:12.832
Although now
I'm thinking

27:12.865 --> 27:14.300
that this information
is obsolete.

27:14.333 --> 27:15.167
NIKKI:
New problem.

27:15.201 --> 27:17.203
One of these is
the authentic pair.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.237
Really?

27:18.270 --> 27:20.106
Hmm.

27:20.139 --> 27:23.309
Um, you could compare
material bases

27:23.342 --> 27:26.879
using a cross-dissection.

27:26.913 --> 27:28.214
Uh, is he suggesting
we cut open

27:28.247 --> 27:30.016
a pair of Final Edition
Primers?

27:30.049 --> 27:31.017
Buoyancy, then.

27:31.050 --> 27:33.119
If these counterfeits
are made from a mold,

27:33.152 --> 27:35.154
than a buoyant force
acting on a counterfeit

27:35.187 --> 27:37.123
would be different
from a buoyant force acting

27:37.156 --> 27:38.090
on an authentic pair.

27:38.124 --> 27:39.826
Buoyancy means water, right?

27:39.859 --> 27:42.228
Not on hand-stitched
tumbled leather.

27:42.261 --> 27:43.963
Charlie, is
there a way

27:43.996 --> 27:45.364
to do it without destroying
a pair of the shoes?

27:45.397 --> 27:46.899
There is.

27:46.933 --> 27:49.068
I would need an authentic pair
of Primers.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.240
*

27:54.273 --> 27:55.808
* Right foot out

27:55.842 --> 27:57.243
* Left foot pause

27:57.276 --> 28:00.046
* Right foot in,
left foot stall *

28:00.079 --> 28:01.147
* Right foot front

28:01.180 --> 28:02.148
* Left foot pause

28:02.181 --> 28:05.417
* Right foot in
and back and forth and... *

28:05.451 --> 28:06.953
You know what?

28:06.986 --> 28:08.187
I need more sneakers.

28:08.220 --> 28:09.188
(calls):
Where's the assistant?

28:11.290 --> 28:13.225
(grunting)

28:14.493 --> 28:15.494
Sorry.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.730
Thought I might have slipped
a disc back there.

28:17.764 --> 28:18.597
CHARLIE:
You okay?

28:18.630 --> 28:20.867
Yeah, yeah, no,
I'm fine, I'm fine.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.268
I can't believe
they use the word "air"

28:22.301 --> 28:23.235
to describe
these things.

28:23.269 --> 28:25.905
This the way you treat
all your lab assistants?

28:25.938 --> 28:26.605
No.

28:26.638 --> 28:27.506
Actually, they
spend a week

28:27.539 --> 28:28.808
of horticultural

28:28.841 --> 28:30.142
boot camp at the Eppes house.

28:30.176 --> 28:32.779
I see.
That's who cuts our lawn.

28:32.812 --> 28:34.346
I'll be back.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.349
- Hey.
CHARLIE: Hey.

28:37.383 --> 28:38.818
Nice shades.

28:38.851 --> 28:39.651
Thank you.

28:39.685 --> 28:40.753
Who puts the Coppertone
on who first?

28:40.787 --> 28:41.620
Actually,
this machine

28:41.653 --> 28:43.890
has no impact
on skin pigmentation.

28:43.923 --> 28:46.058
Yeah, hyperspectral imaging
just simply collects

28:46.092 --> 28:47.760
and processes information

28:47.794 --> 28:49.896
from across the
electromagnetic spectrum.

28:49.929 --> 28:51.463
How's it do that?

28:51.497 --> 28:52.531
By seeing all

28:52.564 --> 28:53.833
ranges of light,

28:53.866 --> 28:55.467
from the visible
to the ultraviolet.

28:55.501 --> 28:57.336
In much the
same manner

28:57.369 --> 28:58.971
as a mantis shrimp.

28:59.005 --> 29:00.539
Who curiously are neither
mantis nor shrimp.

29:00.572 --> 29:01.874
They just look alike.

29:01.908 --> 29:04.310
These are the guys

29:04.343 --> 29:05.945
that are going
to help us?

29:07.213 --> 29:09.481
Okay.

29:09.515 --> 29:11.350
It's a little bit like
this stress ball.

29:11.383 --> 29:12.418
Now, it may
resemble

29:12.451 --> 29:14.453
the far heavier paperweight,

29:14.486 --> 29:16.856
but they have different
core properties.

29:16.889 --> 29:17.857
Ow!

29:18.891 --> 29:19.725
What are you doing?

29:19.758 --> 29:20.759
I just thought you were
gonna catch it.

29:21.961 --> 29:24.196
The hyperspectral
sensors

29:24.230 --> 29:26.365
collect information
as a set of images.

29:26.398 --> 29:27.533
And then that
information

29:27.566 --> 29:30.536
is combined to form
a 3-D picture

29:30.569 --> 29:33.339
which reveals the object's
true properties.

29:33.372 --> 29:34.907
And... by testing these
warehouse shoes,

29:34.941 --> 29:37.043
along with the
authentic Primers,

29:37.076 --> 29:42.148
the hyperspectral will
tell us which of these pairs

29:42.181 --> 29:45.384
is identical to the
authentic pairs.

29:56.228 --> 29:57.796
(beeping)

30:03.602 --> 30:05.137
Sneakers and shrimp

30:05.171 --> 30:06.338
with X-ray vision?
I remember when zippers

30:06.372 --> 30:08.440
on kicks were cutting-edge
technology.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.442
You talking about
KangaROOS?

30:10.476 --> 30:12.511
I had a pair of ROOS
in the second grade.

30:12.544 --> 30:14.413
Wore them everywhere.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.415
I used to keep quarters
in the zipper pockets.

30:16.448 --> 30:17.850
- For the ice cream man?
- Yup.

30:17.884 --> 30:19.852
Man, the sneaker game.

30:19.886 --> 30:21.320
Some call it
a subculture,

30:21.353 --> 30:23.489
but I think it's about back
in the day memories.

30:23.522 --> 30:25.491
Nothing better
than somebody asking,

30:25.524 --> 30:26.926
"Where'd you
get those?"

30:26.959 --> 30:28.094
Right?

30:28.127 --> 30:30.129
In a neighborhood full
of afterthoughts,

30:30.162 --> 30:33.065
dope pair of kicks made a kid
feel good about herself.

30:33.099 --> 30:34.366
*

30:58.557 --> 31:00.559
Well, it's been

31:00.592 --> 31:02.094
relayed through the ether

31:02.128 --> 31:03.562
that your time with us
may be short.

31:03.595 --> 31:06.999
FBI made me an offer that I...

31:07.033 --> 31:09.035
I just couldn't refuse.

31:09.068 --> 31:10.636
I congratulate and commend you.

31:10.669 --> 31:12.471
Decisions that

31:12.504 --> 31:14.406
take us away from family...
those are, those are...

31:14.440 --> 31:16.175
well, they're not easy ones.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.544
It's not that hard.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.346
Older brother's busy

31:20.379 --> 31:22.348
with the State Department.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.650
Younger brother's in prison,

31:24.683 --> 31:26.986
and father died years ago.

31:28.654 --> 31:32.291
If I turned down a promotion
like this,

31:32.324 --> 31:34.526
I don't get another shot
for three years.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.129
Well, new opportunities

31:37.163 --> 31:39.131
sometimes require

31:39.165 --> 31:40.967
just kind of
leaving others behind.

31:41.000 --> 31:45.137
And in my case,
I found my new family.

31:45.171 --> 31:47.473
The people I work with,

31:47.506 --> 31:49.575
laugh with, think with.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.510
So,

31:51.543 --> 31:53.379
I suppose
I found my reason to stay.

31:59.251 --> 32:01.487
None of these shoes
are authentic.

32:01.520 --> 32:02.688
And yet, they still manage

32:02.721 --> 32:04.523
to keep your feet
from getting dirty.

32:04.556 --> 32:07.159
(groans)

32:07.193 --> 32:09.161
Oh, look at that. Size 12.

32:22.208 --> 32:23.342
You don't start talking soon,

32:23.375 --> 32:24.543
you're on your way back
to Shkoder.

32:24.576 --> 32:28.480
Diddums has the Primers.

32:28.514 --> 32:30.316
When he came back

32:30.349 --> 32:31.683
to the warehouse
for the real pair,

32:31.717 --> 32:33.452
he put a gun in my face,

32:33.485 --> 32:35.554
so I told him where
to find the shoes.

32:35.587 --> 32:37.556
Why didn't you tell us this
to begin with?

32:37.589 --> 32:38.724
(laughs)

32:38.757 --> 32:41.593
Uh, I figured I could make bail,
hunt down Diddums myself.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.495
Win-win.

32:43.529 --> 32:46.598
Take the shoes or his money.

32:46.632 --> 32:47.666
Hunt him down where?

33:01.080 --> 33:03.615
(tires squealing)

33:05.651 --> 33:06.752
FBI!
FBI!

33:06.785 --> 33:07.653
BOTH:
Get down!

33:09.155 --> 33:10.156
I got Diddums!

33:20.666 --> 33:22.734
You, down!

33:22.768 --> 33:24.203
(grunts)

33:24.236 --> 33:25.571
Hands behind your back.
Spread your legs.

33:25.604 --> 33:26.805
(grunts)

33:26.838 --> 33:28.407
Got my running
shoes on today.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.209
Nice. Where are
the Primers?

33:30.242 --> 33:32.611
Primers what?

33:32.644 --> 33:34.080
Oh.

33:34.113 --> 33:35.414
That's a lot of cash
you got there.

33:35.447 --> 33:37.783
Found it under
my pillow.

33:37.816 --> 33:38.850
He's erased his call history.

33:38.884 --> 33:41.220
Hey, don't bother checking
the SIM chip, either.

33:41.253 --> 33:42.754
I torched that, too.

33:42.788 --> 33:43.622
(grunts)

33:43.655 --> 33:45.457
Your uncle teach you
how to do that?

33:45.491 --> 33:47.759
Hey.

33:47.793 --> 33:49.595
Take a look at this.

33:50.729 --> 33:52.798
(phone beeping)
Nice!

33:52.831 --> 33:54.766
(David sighs)

33:54.800 --> 33:57.569
(phone ringing through)

33:57.603 --> 34:00.706
* You gotta be a Bit O' Nutz
In This World... *

34:00.739 --> 34:04.476
give you his number?Vic Moritz

34:04.510 --> 34:06.145
Better question.

34:06.178 --> 34:08.580
Why didn't anybody teach you
not to write on your hand?

34:08.614 --> 34:10.682
Come on, genius.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.484
This way.

34:12.518 --> 34:13.552
Yo, where have you been?

34:13.585 --> 34:15.354
I've been calling all day.
I've been going crazy.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.755
Get your hands
behind your back.

34:16.788 --> 34:17.889
What?

34:17.923 --> 34:19.425
Crazy to hire thieves to
steal from Randall Nespola?

34:19.458 --> 34:21.193
Oh, okay,
okay, listen.

34:21.227 --> 34:22.594
I mean, maybe
we can work something out.

34:22.628 --> 34:24.196
Uh, you know, you like
autographed CDs or something?

34:24.230 --> 34:25.364
Where are
the sneakers?

34:25.397 --> 34:26.865
I don't know, man.
I wish I could tell you.

34:26.898 --> 34:28.400
You know, I
hear in jail,

34:28.434 --> 34:30.102
the term Bit O' Nutz has
a whole different meaning.

34:30.136 --> 34:31.503
Wait, wait.
You are not hearing me.

34:31.537 --> 34:34.140
Look, I had the Primers,
as in past tense.

34:37.576 --> 34:39.545
DON:
Unbelievable.

34:39.578 --> 34:41.547
MORITZ:
Think you don't believe this?

34:41.580 --> 34:43.582
Imagine waking up to this.

34:43.615 --> 34:44.816
NIKKI:
I usually chase people

34:44.850 --> 34:47.186
in sneakers,
not the sneakers themselves.

34:47.219 --> 34:49.155
(laughs)

34:57.329 --> 35:00.199
What's it called
when deja vu is real?

35:00.232 --> 35:02.301
It's called "we
missed something."

35:02.334 --> 35:04.136
Diddums is in custody,

35:04.170 --> 35:06.872
we searched his place,
no shoes.

35:06.905 --> 35:10.176
Moritz could have hidden
his collection somewhere else.

35:10.209 --> 35:11.610
Let's go with
what we have.

35:11.643 --> 35:14.580
Techs say that a torch
was used to open the vault.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.815
Now, they also found
a point of entry--

35:16.848 --> 35:18.484
broken window in the garage.

35:18.517 --> 35:19.851
A straightforward
smash-and-grab.

35:19.885 --> 35:21.052
For an entire vault of shoes?

35:21.086 --> 35:24.623
NIKKI: Well, maybe the thief
knows how to fence sneakers.

35:24.656 --> 35:26.392
Or he's trying to throw us off.

35:26.425 --> 35:28.360
The real prize here
is the Primers.

35:28.394 --> 35:30.896
Who knew about the Primers

35:30.929 --> 35:34.600
and has the ability
to pull off big heists?

35:34.633 --> 35:38.204
Doesn't seem like
Stephanois' style.

35:38.237 --> 35:40.639
But he is getting old,
and he's in a hurry.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.741
Ticket to Tahiti.

35:42.774 --> 35:44.543
DAVID:
Stephanois is in the wind,

35:44.576 --> 35:46.612
so I figured 24 hours tops
to move the shoes.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.647
You know, I can't help

35:48.680 --> 35:50.682
but relate this conundrum
to Shipwrecks and Sneakers.

35:50.716 --> 35:51.750
Okay, what's that?

35:51.783 --> 35:52.784
(exhales)

35:53.852 --> 35:55.254
Well, it could work

35:55.287 --> 35:56.655
as a method of telegraphing.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.257
We reverse the focus.

35:58.290 --> 35:59.791
We use the elements

35:59.825 --> 36:01.960
we know to predict
where the shoes

36:01.993 --> 36:03.729
will float to.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.431
Right. For David it works.

36:05.464 --> 36:06.598
LARRY:
Well, what do we know?

36:06.632 --> 36:07.733
The market value
of the shoes,

36:07.766 --> 36:10.202
and the sneakerheads who
might be interested in them.

36:10.236 --> 36:12.771
Right. And the telegraph process
links these two factors.

36:12.804 --> 36:14.806
It measures risk
versus reward.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.843
It gives us a third factor--
the most likely buyer.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.745
I mean, we all play pinball.

36:19.778 --> 36:21.713
Think of the Primers
as a pinball.

36:21.747 --> 36:25.317
Now, the number of buyers
is already limited.

36:25.351 --> 36:28.454
The level of risk involved
with purchasing the shoes

36:28.487 --> 36:30.489
tells us where the bumpers are.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.991
Now, the Primers
are extremely high-priced.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.726
They're high-profile.

36:34.760 --> 36:36.928
They're high-risk, considering
they're stolen property.

36:36.962 --> 36:39.498
So the number
of possible avenues,

36:39.531 --> 36:40.866
of possible buyers,
considering all factors,

36:40.899 --> 36:44.336
becomes extremely limited.

36:44.370 --> 36:46.705
In fact, the buyer
with the least risk

36:46.738 --> 36:49.007
and the greatest ability
to purchase

36:49.040 --> 36:51.243
is the same person
that we might least suspect.

36:52.411 --> 36:53.679
The original owner.

37:08.827 --> 37:10.496
All right, hold it.

37:10.529 --> 37:11.663
Hands behind the back.

37:11.697 --> 37:12.831
You know the drill.

37:12.864 --> 37:14.700
I suppose Tahiti
will have to wait, huh?

37:14.733 --> 37:15.901
But you'll always
have Paris, right?

37:15.934 --> 37:17.736
Must have just
sold the shoes.

37:19.938 --> 37:21.907
Got your call, Eppes.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.742
Didn't believe it
till Stephanois showed up.

37:23.775 --> 37:24.943
Where's Nespola?

37:24.976 --> 37:26.445
Inside.

37:26.478 --> 37:27.979
Technically, he's
on foreign soil,

37:28.013 --> 37:29.781
so he's got diplomatic immunity.

37:29.815 --> 37:33.251
Yeah, he may have immunity,
but the shoes don't.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.492
They're my Primers!

37:40.526 --> 37:42.594
They're stolen, and they're
evidence in a murder case.

37:42.628 --> 37:43.862
NESPOLA:
You know, I'm Foreign Consul.

37:43.895 --> 37:44.996
I don't, uh... I don't have

37:45.030 --> 37:45.997
to cooperate with the FBI.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.299
NIKKI:
Yeah, you're right.

37:47.333 --> 37:48.534
But the Primers are coming
with us,

37:48.567 --> 37:50.402
which means they'll
be in evidence.

37:50.436 --> 37:52.070
You never know how
long that could take.

37:52.103 --> 37:53.739
Who knows how the sneakers will
be treated once they get there?

37:53.772 --> 37:56.375
Man, some of the stories
I heard about evidence.

37:56.408 --> 37:57.476
Oh, yeah, I've
heard some. Phew!

37:57.509 --> 37:58.544
(drops pool stick on table)

37:58.577 --> 37:59.645
Okay. If I cooperate,

37:59.678 --> 38:02.047
you promise you're gonna
take care of the Primers?

38:02.080 --> 38:03.715
You gonna make
your auction payment?

38:03.749 --> 38:04.883
(sighs)

38:04.916 --> 38:06.985
No scuff marks
on the shoes, okay?

38:07.018 --> 38:08.354
Listen, whoever
is in evidence,

38:08.387 --> 38:09.688
please, you got
to make sure

38:09.721 --> 38:10.956
that they know
what they're doing.

38:10.989 --> 38:12.458
You cannot put them
in direct sunlight.

38:12.491 --> 38:13.692
Just give us
the damn shoes, huh?

38:13.725 --> 38:16.495
(sighs)

38:16.528 --> 38:20.366
So, anyway, I just put it
in a box inside the...

38:20.399 --> 38:21.833
Closet? Really?

38:21.867 --> 38:23.402
Yeah, well, my vault's
voice recognition

38:23.435 --> 38:25.070
won't be reconfigured
for another week, okay?

38:25.103 --> 38:27.038
So, until then...

38:30.041 --> 38:32.378
Oh, no.

38:32.411 --> 38:33.812
(laughs)
Come on.

38:33.845 --> 38:34.980
I just put them there.

38:35.013 --> 38:37.349
Oh, here we go again.

38:37.383 --> 38:39.818
(rhythmic bouncing of ball)

38:41.920 --> 38:43.355
That sounds like...

38:45.691 --> 38:47.593
(drops box)

38:56.668 --> 38:58.470
Dad, I saw you

38:58.504 --> 38:59.938
hide these, but they're so cool!

38:59.971 --> 39:01.407
Best birthday ever!

39:03.509 --> 39:05.744
These are for me, right?

39:10.682 --> 39:12.751
Let's say, uh, we'll give
your dad a second, okay?

39:12.784 --> 39:14.486
Show him what you got.
Let's D.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.021
Little bit of D.

39:16.054 --> 39:17.823
Get up.
(laughs)

39:17.856 --> 39:19.425
Hand-stitched leather,

39:19.458 --> 39:21.460
candy-painted chassis,

39:21.493 --> 39:23.862
carbon fiber
steel shank plates

39:23.895 --> 39:25.797
in each sole.

39:25.831 --> 39:27.833
And a smile on your kid's face.

39:27.866 --> 39:29.935
Buy the shoes for him.

39:29.968 --> 39:32.438
Yeah, look at how
much fun he's having.

39:32.471 --> 39:34.806
DAVID:
Come on, play some D, baby!

39:34.840 --> 39:36.141
I got you.
Give it up!

39:36.174 --> 39:37.175
All right, that's you.

39:37.208 --> 39:41.880
* What's in store
for the memories and me? *

39:41.913 --> 39:45.150
* But I already know it

39:45.183 --> 39:48.487
* How much
did I pay for this life? *

39:48.520 --> 39:50.556
* Or do I

39:50.589 --> 39:53.759
* Already own it?

39:53.792 --> 39:55.594
* I always get too close...

39:55.627 --> 39:56.995
(whispers):
Just put it on the table.

39:57.028 --> 39:58.530
NIKKI:
Hey, hey.

39:58.564 --> 39:59.865
You got a name for your company?

39:59.898 --> 40:00.866
Not yet.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.801
I don't think Phil Knight
came up with Nike

40:02.834 --> 40:03.969
till he got his first shoe.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.137
Nespola made his
auction payment.

40:06.171 --> 40:08.607
Here's your
commission check.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.543
(gasps)

40:11.577 --> 40:12.511
Yeah, he was in a generous mood.

40:12.544 --> 40:13.912
That's cool.

40:13.945 --> 40:15.013
Good looking out.

40:15.046 --> 40:17.115
Now, you can
quit your job,

40:17.148 --> 40:20.218
you know, do this
thing for real.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.220
You know I'll bring the heat.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.789
Okay, I just
got one request.

40:23.822 --> 40:25.123
What's that?

40:25.156 --> 40:28.026
Can you make me a pair
with zippers on the side?

40:28.059 --> 40:30.662
Sure.
(laughs)

40:33.231 --> 40:36.001
Liz said she'd call us
when she lands in Denver.

40:36.034 --> 40:37.235
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.737
Well, anything for me?

40:38.770 --> 40:41.873
Uh, no. Sorry. This is...
actually, it's all me.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.108
So check it out.
John Maeda--

40:43.141 --> 40:44.943
he's a professor at MIT--

40:44.976 --> 40:46.912
he, uh... he designed
a pair of kicks

40:46.945 --> 40:49.848
based on his own algorithms,
so I thought I'd do the same.

40:49.881 --> 40:51.550
Check these out.
What do you think?

40:51.583 --> 40:54.252
Hidden Markov model
on the toe.

40:54.285 --> 40:56.955
Uh, some Hermetian random
matrixes on the tongue.

40:56.988 --> 40:58.757
And, uh, social network
analysis throughout.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.526
Air Geeks.

41:00.559 --> 41:02.928
(laughter)

41:02.961 --> 41:04.830
Okay, dinner is almost ready.

41:04.863 --> 41:07.833
Tonight, you all have the honor
of having, uh, goulash.

41:07.866 --> 41:10.035
Hungarian for whatever's
in the fridge.

41:10.068 --> 41:12.203
What's up, Pop? You had a bad
day at the lab or something?

41:12.237 --> 41:13.939
Yeah, that's, uh,
very funny.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.173
(doorbell rings)
Oh.

41:15.206 --> 41:17.509
Now just keep
on laughing.

41:17.543 --> 41:18.677
Think I'm gonna
change my will.

41:18.710 --> 41:19.845
Oh.

41:19.878 --> 41:21.279
On my way over,
look who I found.

41:21.312 --> 41:22.648
ALAN:
Hey.

41:22.681 --> 41:23.815
Oh.

41:23.849 --> 41:25.551
Aren't you supposed
to be on a plane?

41:25.584 --> 41:27.519
I was.

41:27.553 --> 41:28.787
And then I looked at my boots.

41:28.820 --> 41:33.625
I've, uh... had these
boots for seven years.

41:35.026 --> 41:36.828
I've worn them into the ground.

41:36.862 --> 41:40.832
I've replaced the
heels, the zippers.

41:40.866 --> 41:44.069
But I'd never give them up.

41:46.572 --> 41:48.807
So if I can't let go of a...

41:48.840 --> 41:51.577
pair of boots, then...

41:51.610 --> 41:53.745
...why the hell
would I ever let go

41:53.779 --> 41:55.313
of a great situation
like this?

41:55.346 --> 41:57.082
A great job

41:57.115 --> 41:58.684
doesn't compare
to a great life.

42:00.652 --> 42:04.222
You guys are family.

42:04.255 --> 42:05.624
Well said.

42:05.657 --> 42:06.992
ALAN:
Wait a minute.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.760
Did you just compare us
to a pair of old boots?

42:08.794 --> 42:10.161
I did.

42:10.195 --> 42:11.763
DON: How do you know we were
even gonna take you back?

42:11.797 --> 42:13.665
- Yeah. Well...
- Just sit down.

42:13.699 --> 42:14.900
Speaking of
old boots,

42:14.933 --> 42:16.602
let's eat some goulash.

42:16.635 --> 42:17.936
Definitely changing my will,
definitely.

42:17.969 --> 42:19.971
(laughter)
