WEBVTT

00:06.979 --> 00:08.480
Excuse me.

00:10.759 --> 00:13.943
Guy, there's
a messenger outside with a letter.

00:13.939 --> 00:16.783
He's insisting he gives it to
the Lord Of The Manor in person.

00:16.779 --> 00:20.761
Is it from Lady Marian?
No, he says it's from the King.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.260
The King?

00:25.359 --> 00:27.304
So where is he, then?

00:27.299 --> 00:29.187
Well, he was here a minute ago.

00:29.179 --> 00:33.400
He thought Robin was still
Lord Of The Manor. Maybe he
found out he wasn't and ran off.

00:33.399 --> 00:38.223
And what fool told him that?

00:38.219 --> 00:40.983
Get after him! I want that letter!

00:40.979 --> 00:43.959
Yeah. He won't get far.
He's only on foot. Ha!

00:43.959 --> 00:46.746
Hey. Guards, come on!

00:46.739 --> 00:49.924
Happy Birthday, Gisborne.

00:49.919 --> 00:51.489
Party going well, is it?

00:51.479 --> 00:53.003
We've got a problem.

00:59.699 --> 01:03.567
Just give us the letter and
we'll let you go, all right? No!

01:20.379 --> 01:22.085
SHOUTING IN THE DISTANCE

01:23.939 --> 01:26.703
Oi! Over 'ere.

01:26.699 --> 01:28.587
Come along!

01:28.579 --> 01:31.787
Look, you've got the most
distinctive tracks in the forest.

01:31.779 --> 01:34.259
You might as well give up now!

01:34.259 --> 01:35.408
This way!

02:04.679 --> 02:06.385
BRANCH CREAKS

02:07.899 --> 02:09.662
HE PANTS

02:13.499 --> 02:15.069
Aaaaargh!

02:15.059 --> 02:17.641
Ooh! Oh-uh!

02:17.639 --> 02:19.709
Uh.

02:19.699 --> 02:21.781
HE GRUNTS IN PAIN

02:23.659 --> 02:25.445
Give us the message from the King.

02:25.439 --> 02:27.782
It's for Robin Of
Locksley and his eyes only.

02:27.779 --> 02:29.986
Just give it to me
or we'll take it from you.

02:29.979 --> 02:31.970
ARROW ZOOMING THROUGH THE AIR

02:31.959 --> 02:33.142
Ugh! Ugh!

02:38.379 --> 02:41.166
Don't you know it's rude
to read other people's mail? !

03:22.179 --> 03:26.343
By the time you get close
enough to use those swords,
you'll be so full of arrows,

03:26.339 --> 03:28.443
you'll look like hedgehogs.

03:30.899 --> 03:32.582
HE CHUCKLES

03:32.579 --> 03:34.524
So. . .

03:34.519 --> 03:37.750
This is what Gisborne's
dogsbody does, is it?

03:37.739 --> 03:40.139
I'm not his dogsbody.
I'm his right-hand man.

03:40.139 --> 03:42.505
Oh.

03:42.499 --> 03:45.468
I couldn't face myself
in the morning, if I was you.

03:45.459 --> 03:50.385
I count my money in the morning.
While you two are squabbling,
there's a man in agony over there.

03:50.379 --> 03:52.062
Run back to your master.

03:52.059 --> 03:53.060
Go on.

03:54.059 --> 03:55.640
Go on!

03:57.199 --> 03:58.746
RUN!

03:59.739 --> 04:02.526
Do you practise
little speeches like that?

04:02.519 --> 04:06.467
Like what? "You'll be so full of
arrows, you'll look like hedgehogs."

04:06.459 --> 04:11.123
No, it just came to mind.
You practise, don't you? No.

04:11.119 --> 04:13.986
Robin. . . Ssh-sh-sh-sh.

04:13.979 --> 04:15.503
I know you.

04:15.499 --> 04:17.125
MAN GROANS IN PAIN

04:17.119 --> 04:19.404
Save your strength.

04:19.399 --> 04:20.899
Lardner. . .

04:23.879 --> 04:25.642
Lardner!

04:32.599 --> 04:34.703
It's the royal seal.
It is from Richard.

04:39.399 --> 04:41.048
So, where are they, Gisborne?

04:41.039 --> 04:43.906
They'll be here. Woodcock, Sir Guy.

04:43.899 --> 04:46.561
Birthday treat.

04:46.559 --> 04:48.481
Shall I get started?

04:48.479 --> 04:50.401
If you must.

04:50.399 --> 04:52.867
Your men had better get
to him before Robin does.

04:56.519 --> 04:58.885
He wants reinforcements.

04:58.879 --> 05:01.006
He wants more men.

05:00.999 --> 05:04.366
He still has got no idea. He has
no idea what's happening in England.

05:04.359 --> 05:07.681
The message you sent with Carter.
It can't have reached the King yet.

05:07.679 --> 05:11.206
Many a courier gets intercepted.
The proof of that's right here.

05:11.199 --> 05:12.484
He wants me to send. . .

05:13.519 --> 05:15.567
. .a note back with. . .

05:15.559 --> 05:19.165
Lardner, telling him how many men
I can recruit and when I'll arrive.

05:23.679 --> 05:26.887
But. . . This. . . This isn't Lardner.

05:26.879 --> 05:29.484
This is McLellan.
This is Lawrence McLellan.

05:29.479 --> 05:30.980
Well, then who's Lardner?

05:37.919 --> 05:40.444
Richard The Lionheart,
they call him.

05:40.439 --> 05:45.866
Going into battle in
a foreign land, it's not the
heart of a lion you want, is it?

05:45.859 --> 05:46.905
Huh?

05:46.899 --> 05:51.086
Since when did
a heart hurt anybody? Huh? !

05:51.079 --> 05:53.559
Come on then! Come on!

05:53.559 --> 05:55.800
I've got the heart of a lion!

05:57.559 --> 06:01.609
You can imagine the Saracens
translating that, can't you?

06:01.599 --> 06:02.964
LAUGHTER

06:02.959 --> 06:05.041
"He's got the what of a lion?

06:05.039 --> 06:07.519
"The teeth?

06:07.519 --> 06:10.443
"The jaws? The claws?"

06:10.439 --> 06:12.487
LAUGHTER

06:12.479 --> 06:15.880
No! The heart!

06:15.879 --> 06:18.404
Richard The Lion Claw,
Jerusalem's yours.

06:18.399 --> 06:21.926
Come in. Sit down. Help yourself!

06:21.919 --> 06:24.649
Lion Heart?

06:24.639 --> 06:27.688
It's good, very good.
Forget about it.

06:27.679 --> 06:31.206
It's no wonder it's taking
him so long over there, is it?

06:31.199 --> 06:32.484
LAUGHTER

06:35.339 --> 06:38.319
Mind you, mind you. . .

06:38.319 --> 06:40.685
It's better
than his brother, isn't it?

06:40.679 --> 06:42.943
Prince John.

06:42.939 --> 06:45.043
What's Prince John doing?

06:45.039 --> 06:48.361
Sitting at home,
heart of a dormouse?

06:48.359 --> 06:51.465
Prince John is a friend of mine!

06:51.459 --> 06:52.699
It's a joke. It's what I do.

06:52.699 --> 06:55.202
I do other things.
Let's try some soothsaying.

06:55.199 --> 06:59.750
Sit down, sit down, sit down.
I'll make some predictions and
then I'll make them come true.

06:59.739 --> 07:03.425
Someone in this room
will bare their buttocks
to the Sheriff tonight.

07:03.419 --> 07:05.068
Take that man to the dungeons now!

07:05.059 --> 07:09.223
No, hang on. Prediction two, Sir
Guy's joint will rise from the dead.

07:09.219 --> 07:14.225
What's that supposed to mean?
Your woodcock, Sir Guy, I can bring
it back to life. Get rid of him!

07:14.219 --> 07:16.403
My third prediction's
about Prince John.

07:16.399 --> 07:18.867
One day Prince John will be King
of England. I know that already.

07:18.859 --> 07:22.943
But did you know there's something
in Nottingham that can stop him?
Like what?

07:22.939 --> 07:25.339
Lardner's Ring.

07:25.339 --> 07:27.227
What is Lardner's Ring?

07:27.219 --> 07:29.608
Well, let me go and I'll tell you.

07:29.599 --> 07:33.729
Lock him in the cell overnight,
flog him in the morning
and then he'll tell us.

07:33.719 --> 07:36.347
Now that really is funny!

07:36.339 --> 07:37.567
RAUCOUS LAUGHTER

07:38.299 --> 07:40.904
You should listen to me!
I know what I'm talking about.

07:40.899 --> 07:43.663
Ah!

07:43.659 --> 07:48.460
The first prediction! I told you!
And the others will follow.

07:48.459 --> 07:50.609
Beware the power of Lardner's Ring.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.061
What is Lardner's Ring?

08:02.099 --> 08:07.127
I know I'm meant to be loyal
and obedient, but the King
doesn't know the facts.

08:07.119 --> 08:09.360
And once he does, then we turn home.

08:09.359 --> 08:12.066
And this is no time for you
to go back to the Holy Land.

08:13.679 --> 08:16.147
We're agreed then.

08:19.719 --> 08:20.947
Absolutely.

08:30.359 --> 08:32.361
Would you like to say a few words?

08:40.198 --> 08:41.826
Go on then.

08:45.119 --> 08:47.019
Will you marry me?

08:49.239 --> 08:50.740
What?

08:57.679 --> 09:01.649
The first time I held my bow,
I knew.

09:03.199 --> 09:06.202
It felt right.

09:06.199 --> 09:07.666
Like it had been made for me.

09:10.039 --> 09:12.223
And that's how I feel about you.

09:14.679 --> 09:19.582
I promised your father
I would protect and look after you.

09:21.319 --> 09:23.287
But it works both ways.

09:24.899 --> 09:28.300
I look after my bow because
it protects and looks after me.

09:32.279 --> 09:34.463
Together we're stronger.

09:42.159 --> 09:43.649
So. . .

09:53.639 --> 09:54.685
Marian.

09:54.679 --> 09:56.806
Will you marry me?

10:02.399 --> 10:04.845
Robin,
of every single man in the world,

10:06.479 --> 10:08.049
you are the only one. . .

10:08.039 --> 10:10.610
Is that a yes?
Will you let me finish?

10:10.599 --> 10:12.965
I'm sorry.

10:12.959 --> 10:19.728
The only one who would
propose over a fresh grave

10:19.719 --> 10:23.644
by comparing me to your weapon.
Well, is that a no?

10:23.639 --> 10:25.379
Who will give me away?

10:25.379 --> 10:27.882
I can ask the King.

10:31.619 --> 10:34.486
So we find Lardner
and bring the King home.

10:36.039 --> 10:38.985
Defeat the Sheriff

10:38.979 --> 10:41.004
and then we get married.

10:45.059 --> 10:46.663
Well, that sounds like a plan.

10:57.719 --> 10:59.243
Move, you worm!

10:59.239 --> 11:01.400
MEN MOAN

11:03.579 --> 11:05.581
Right.

11:05.579 --> 11:07.570
Uh!

11:07.559 --> 11:09.709
What's that? !

11:09.699 --> 11:11.564
It's a dove.

11:11.559 --> 11:14.005
Well, I've seen it all now!

11:17.099 --> 11:20.227
Here, why do you keep
a bird in your pocket?

11:20.219 --> 11:22.483
Why do you keep
a worm in your pants?

11:24.059 --> 11:27.187
You should keep an eye
on that belt of yours!

11:35.779 --> 11:37.246
Where is he?

11:39.059 --> 11:43.029
He's dead. What about the message?
Well, we got part of it, yeah.

11:43.019 --> 11:45.590
But Robin turned up. . .
Turned up?!

11:45.579 --> 11:49.583
And got his message? I don't know.

11:49.579 --> 11:51.547
Look, he kinda took us by surprise.

11:51.539 --> 11:54.770
All we heard him say
was "Lardner", that was it.

11:56.379 --> 11:57.425
(Lardner.)

11:57.419 --> 11:59.023
(That's what he said.)

12:04.179 --> 12:06.227
I blame you for this!

12:07.259 --> 12:10.467
You had him on your doorstep
and you let him escape? !

12:10.459 --> 12:12.700
You and your imbeciles!

12:12.699 --> 12:16.829
Six legs against one and the one

12:16.819 --> 12:18.707
got away!

12:18.699 --> 12:20.223
PEOPLE GASP

12:30.939 --> 12:37.583
There's an explanation. There
is always a rational explanation.

12:40.659 --> 12:46.780
We know McLellan and the Fool spoke
together, so something was said
about the ring of Lardner.

12:46.779 --> 12:49.623
Maybe it's got a coded
inscription on it. It's no problem.

12:49.619 --> 12:52.907
We'll just torture the Fool
until he tells us.

12:54.019 --> 12:55.623
He's disappeared!

12:58.839 --> 13:00.943
I know that, you blithering oaf!

13:15.019 --> 13:16.668
Know anyone called Lardner?

13:18.339 --> 13:22.685
Have you ever known
or heard of anyone

13:22.679 --> 13:25.682
or anything called Lardner?

13:28.539 --> 13:31.121
Lardner's Ring?
What is it? What is it?

13:36.179 --> 13:41.583
Tell us where it is or we will
take every ring in this village.

13:41.579 --> 13:46.425
(It must be some kind of ring tax.)
(Allan's with them.)

13:48.699 --> 13:51.145
Leave me alone!

13:51.139 --> 13:53.482
I don't know anything.

13:56.259 --> 13:58.864
Right, you've had your chance.
Lose the ring

13:58.859 --> 14:01.384
or lose the finger.

14:01.379 --> 14:05.327
Somebody knows where Lardner is.

14:05.319 --> 14:06.707
(Did he say Lardner? )

14:06.699 --> 14:08.223
(Does that mean something to you? )

14:10.099 --> 14:12.329
So, when the sand runs out. . .

14:13.819 --> 14:16.583
. .the finger. . .comes off!

14:19.259 --> 14:21.568
Much, when we were in the Holy Land,

14:21.559 --> 14:24.426
do you remember
anybody called Lardner?

14:24.419 --> 14:27.024
No. Why? Because I have to find him.

14:29.199 --> 14:32.942
Where's, er. . .
Where's Will and Djaq?

14:32.939 --> 14:34.907
They said
they've gone to get some honey.

14:34.899 --> 14:36.287
They'll be back soon.

14:36.279 --> 14:40.545
If that's what they've gone for.
But why does it need two of them?

14:40.539 --> 14:43.463
Hm? Honey is one of those things.

14:44.399 --> 14:46.549
What things?
What do you call it when you use

14:46.539 --> 14:49.485
a sweet innocent word but what
you really mean is something else?

14:49.479 --> 14:52.926
A lie. No.
A euphemism?

14:52.919 --> 14:54.159
A euphemism.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.127
Exactly!

14:56.119 --> 15:00.203
Yes. There's a bit too much honey
going on around here if you ask me.

15:00.199 --> 15:02.622
Will and Djaq nipping off together.

15:02.619 --> 15:04.769
You two going
for long walks in the forest.

15:04.759 --> 15:05.805
He's jealous.

15:05.799 --> 15:10.759
What happened
to fighting for justice and
rebelling against the Sheriff?

15:10.759 --> 15:13.330
We should be sticking together!

15:13.319 --> 15:15.890
Instead,
we're splitting into couples.

15:15.879 --> 15:17.449
To be perfectly honest. . .

15:18.879 --> 15:20.699
. .I don't fancy mine much.

15:22.719 --> 15:25.483
Anyway, while you two
have been off gallivanting. . .

15:25.479 --> 15:27.640
We haven't been gallivanting!

15:27.639 --> 15:29.129
I know what you've been up to.

15:29.119 --> 15:31.360
We've been burying
a corpse in the forest.

15:34.439 --> 15:36.339
Is that a euphemism?

15:40.759 --> 15:42.886
Speak now
and spare this woman's finger.

15:42.879 --> 15:47.202
Say nothing and
your silence proves your guilt.

15:47.199 --> 15:50.088
Can we risk it? Yeah, we have to.

15:50.079 --> 15:53.048
I'll take him the long way round,
lead him away from camp.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.324
Stop!

15:55.479 --> 15:58.368
I know who Lardner is.

15:58.359 --> 16:01.487
And I know about his ring.

16:01.479 --> 16:05.688
Let the woman go. You're
in Robin Hood's gang, aren't you?
Let the woman go!

16:10.279 --> 16:12.850
Now. . .tell me about Lardner.

16:13.879 --> 16:16.200
You'll have to catch us first!

16:16.199 --> 16:17.723
Get after 'em!

17:05.179 --> 17:06.567
That way!

17:16.638 --> 17:19.324
Whoa! Whoa! Hold there, horsey!

17:25.779 --> 17:27.679
Or it was.

17:31.819 --> 17:33.400
Robin?

17:33.399 --> 17:37.347
What's happened? It's Gisborne. He's
at Locksley, terrorising the people.

17:37.339 --> 17:39.102
What?

17:39.099 --> 17:42.523
He's searching for Lardner's Ring.

17:42.519 --> 17:47.786
Ah, Gisborne The Gullible.
I've got something to show you.

17:47.779 --> 17:51.067
First you see it, then you don't.

17:51.059 --> 17:53.289
There it is. And there it isn't.

17:53.279 --> 17:54.769
What's your point?

17:57.299 --> 17:58.539
How did you do that?

17:58.539 --> 18:04.227
You simply pull up on the handle,
the claw grabs hold of the bird.

18:04.219 --> 18:06.642
You lift up the lid,
the bird's gone.

18:09.019 --> 18:12.546
The cooked bird has been
hollowed out, you put a live dove

18:12.539 --> 18:16.339
inside it and lah di dah di dah. . .
A plate full of bird's wings.

18:16.339 --> 18:20.821
Hm? Your Fool, he's no sorcerer,
he's no soothsayer.

18:20.819 --> 18:23.105
And he cannot predict the future.

18:23.099 --> 18:25.442
He was right about
Lardner's Ring though.

18:25.439 --> 18:26.906
Bring 'em in!

18:36.899 --> 18:39.743
Back home, my uncle had a friend.

18:39.739 --> 18:43.106
The Sultan's
official pigeon handler.

18:43.099 --> 18:44.669
He handles pigeons?

18:44.659 --> 18:46.627
Yes, he handles pigeons.

18:46.619 --> 18:48.348
Ajob, I suppose.

18:48.339 --> 18:51.319
It's a very important job, Much!

18:53.239 --> 18:56.185
Now, the Sultan's very best pigeon -

18:57.239 --> 18:58.604
the smallest

18:59.319 --> 19:00.707
and quickest one,

19:00.699 --> 19:04.260
was a pigeon called Lardner.

19:05.579 --> 19:06.580
Right.

19:07.619 --> 19:08.779
Right.

19:08.779 --> 19:10.110
Does he have a ring?

19:10.099 --> 19:13.944
And if he does,
what's so special about it?

19:13.939 --> 19:16.590
The Saracens use
pigeons to carry messages.

19:16.579 --> 19:21.528
They put the message on a little
ring tied to the bird's foot
and then they let it fly off.

19:21.519 --> 19:26.263
It doesn't matter how far away the
bird is when you let it go, because
it will always find its way home.

19:26.259 --> 19:28.841
Carrying the message with it.

19:28.839 --> 19:31.899
But it isn't their home
they are searching for.

19:31.899 --> 19:33.139
It is their mate.

19:34.199 --> 19:39.148
All you have to do
is split the two of them up.

19:39.139 --> 19:43.599
And a pigeon will carry a message
to the ends of the Earth, faster and

19:43.599 --> 19:49.868
straighter than any man ever could,
just to be with the one they love.

19:50.839 --> 19:55.685
So we could get a message to
King Richard, half away across
the world, in no time at all?

19:55.679 --> 19:57.340
A matter of days.

19:58.879 --> 20:00.699
That's incredible!

20:00.699 --> 20:07.821
My question is,
why is the Sultan's best pigeon
being used by King Richard?

20:07.819 --> 20:10.708
Maybe they've formed an alliance
or something.

20:10.699 --> 20:16.387
Or maybe King Richard
and his army have helped themselves.

20:16.379 --> 20:18.984
If they've got Lardner, they've

20:18.979 --> 20:20.981
got the Sultan.

20:22.019 --> 20:24.749
And if they've got the Sultan,

20:24.739 --> 20:26.343
they've got everyone.

20:33.499 --> 20:36.241
We have to go back to the tree.

20:36.239 --> 20:38.503
So that's what he had in his box.

20:38.499 --> 20:41.104
And the only place he
could've left it is up that tree.

20:41.099 --> 20:45.240
You make me sick, you know that?
Betraying your old friends.

20:45.239 --> 20:48.504
I hope you're enjoying it, Allan.
I couldn't live with myself.

20:48.499 --> 20:51.081
Ah well, you won't have to
for much longer, you see.

20:51.079 --> 20:54.082
The penalty for
being in Robin Hood's gang is death!

20:55.799 --> 21:00.429
Right, well. I'm glad I
could have been of service, I think
my work here is done. Can I go now?

21:00.419 --> 21:05.061
You can go, of course. With him,
to the gallows. Hang them both!

21:05.059 --> 21:08.608
And feed their carcasses
to the birds.

21:08.599 --> 21:11.864
Come along, Gisborne.
No time to lose.

21:11.859 --> 21:15.602
No, please. Have mercy.
Don't let them do this to me! Hey.

21:21.499 --> 21:25.321
Please. Well, seeing you swing
will be comedy, won't it?

21:26.739 --> 21:28.320
Very good.

21:36.099 --> 21:39.899
If Robin gets the bird,
it means the King knows our plans.

21:39.899 --> 21:46.623
And the last thing we need is the
King and his army coming back to
England before we're ready for them.

21:46.619 --> 21:50.259
So we must catch the pigeon.

21:50.259 --> 21:52.921
Catch the pigeon now.

21:59.939 --> 22:02.828
But if we wait for Will
then we can all go together!

22:02.819 --> 22:05.947
We have to go now. Come on.
And if Allan returns with more men?

22:05.939 --> 22:10.023
John, if they knew where
Lardner was, they wouldn't
have terrorised the village.

22:10.019 --> 22:12.499
We won't be long. Work on
the message until we get back.

22:12.499 --> 22:13.579
Now give me the rope.

22:13.579 --> 22:15.069
Good luck.

22:45.579 --> 22:49.265
Do you think a bird could
fly that distance and still
find its way home?

22:49.259 --> 22:52.342
The dove found its
way back to Noah's Ark.

22:53.899 --> 22:56.220
How do they do it?

22:56.219 --> 22:58.028
They just follow their hearts.

23:04.219 --> 23:06.619
Won't be long.

23:06.619 --> 23:09.463
You take your time. No rush.

23:09.459 --> 23:12.906
Do you think that contraption's
strong enough to hold the two of us?

23:12.899 --> 23:15.060
Last a lifetime, that will.

23:15.059 --> 23:17.459
Huh-heh! At least your lifetime!

23:18.739 --> 23:21.025
I could do your job.

23:21.019 --> 23:22.862
(I couldn't do yours.)

23:47.779 --> 23:49.201
Can you see it?

23:50.479 --> 23:51.605
That's it, I think.

23:56.999 --> 23:58.785
Can you reach it?

23:58.779 --> 24:00.406
I'm nearly there.

24:07.199 --> 24:10.088
Robin! Robin, the Sheriff's coming.

24:15.619 --> 24:17.189
And Gisborne's with him!

24:20.339 --> 24:21.988
Run!

24:21.979 --> 24:25.324
Go without me! I'll hold them off!

24:29.019 --> 24:31.647
Hang on, stop.

24:31.939 --> 24:33.383
Yeah, that's the tree.

24:47.659 --> 24:51.026
You're surrounded, Hood!

24:51.019 --> 24:52.429
You're going nowhere!

24:52.419 --> 24:54.705
Get back on your horse
and get reinforcements!

24:59.259 --> 25:01.227
What are you doing here?

25:01.219 --> 25:02.982
Hiding.

25:02.979 --> 25:04.708
Great(!)

25:05.619 --> 25:08.861
He could just wait until it gets
dark and then release the bird.

25:08.859 --> 25:10.827
He'll be down before nightfall.

25:13.459 --> 25:16.587
"Come home."
No, it needs more immediacy.

25:16.579 --> 25:19.389
"Come home now".
"Come home immediately!"

25:20.939 --> 25:23.464
"Immediately" is better.
"Immediately" is longer.

25:23.459 --> 25:27.259
What? ! Lardner's a pigeon, not
an eagle. More words, more weight.

25:27.259 --> 25:29.659
It's one word. Same as "now"!

25:29.659 --> 25:32.583
Well, then use "now"!
Too many cooks!

25:34.299 --> 25:39.566
You know, traditionally,
men in your position offer men
in our position a last request?

25:39.559 --> 25:41.402
I don't hold with tradition.

25:41.399 --> 25:45.142
It's just a little thing. Would you
scratch my nose? I've got an itch.

25:45.139 --> 25:47.448
Let the Devil scratch it.

25:47.439 --> 25:50.169
You'll see him soon enough.

25:50.159 --> 25:52.229
Sir Guy's got Robin
Hood trapped up a tree.

25:52.219 --> 25:55.302
He wants every available
man down there now!

25:55.299 --> 25:58.143
Get your horses!
Quick! One last chance.

25:58.139 --> 26:02.508
While no-one's looking,
let us go and we'll say
no more about it, yeah?

26:03.139 --> 26:04.367
I'm a performer!

26:04.359 --> 26:06.907
I can't die without an audience.

26:06.899 --> 26:10.141
It's an insult to my profession.

26:10.139 --> 26:12.903
I told you to keep
an eye on that belt.

26:15.619 --> 26:19.760
Marian, they don't know
you're up here. If I make a run
for it, they'll follow me.

26:19.759 --> 26:22.227
You can escape with Lardner.
They're coming back!

26:28.199 --> 26:30.349
Ugh! Uh!

26:44.859 --> 26:47.168
That is a complete waste of arrows.

26:47.159 --> 26:49.525
Just giving Allan
something to think about.

26:49.519 --> 26:51.589
Think about
us running out of arrows.

26:51.579 --> 26:53.342
Look! Look, they're retreating.

26:57.879 --> 26:59.449
I have an idea.

26:59.439 --> 27:01.703
Do not let them
escape while I'm gone.

27:01.699 --> 27:04.748
He'll be dead by the
time you get back.
I won't hold my breath.

27:11.459 --> 27:14.007
Maybe you could use me as a hostage.

27:13.999 --> 27:16.945
What?
You know Gisborne's feelings for me.

27:16.939 --> 27:20.443
He might let you go, if
he thought it meant getting me back.

27:20.439 --> 27:24.626
Are you mad? I could say
I was on my way home to him
and you ambushed me in the forest.

27:24.619 --> 27:26.883
He'd never fall for it!

27:26.879 --> 27:30.167
And how would that look? Robin
Hood takes Lady Marian hostage!

27:30.159 --> 27:32.980
Oh, yes, us dying
together might look better(!)

27:32.979 --> 27:37.279
But it won't bring the King home.
Even if Gisborne fell
for it, the Sheriff wouldn't.

27:37.279 --> 27:38.348
The Sheriff's gone!

27:38.339 --> 27:42.207
And while Gisborne's in charge. . .
Robin this could be our last chance.

27:42.199 --> 27:43.780
No! It's not happening.

27:43.779 --> 27:47.545
Robin, have you got a better idea?

27:50.139 --> 27:52.289
Right. "Your Majesty.

27:52.279 --> 27:54.008
"No reinforcements.

27:53.999 --> 27:56.206
"John plans to steal your throne. . ."

27:56.199 --> 27:58.247
"Plots."

27:58.239 --> 28:02.107
"Plots" is a better word.
"Plots" is better.

28:04.279 --> 28:05.803
"Your Majesty.

28:05.799 --> 28:07.482
"No reinforcements.

28:07.479 --> 28:10.403
"John plots to steal your throne.

28:10.399 --> 28:11.900
"Come home, now."

28:14.559 --> 28:17.039
Short, sharp and to the point.

28:17.039 --> 28:18.563
I'll add "make peace"

28:18.559 --> 28:20.129
before "come home".

28:20.119 --> 28:23.168
"Make peace immediately."

28:23.159 --> 28:26.606
Ah! You know,
I do like "immediately".

28:26.599 --> 28:28.920
But it needs more emotion.

28:28.919 --> 28:30.887
Make it bigger! Raise the stakes!

28:30.879 --> 28:34.485
And alliterate! Alliteration
makes it much more memorable.

28:34.479 --> 28:36.879
Where have you come from?

28:36.879 --> 28:38.403
I appear. I disappear.

28:38.399 --> 28:42.244
It's what I do. To tell how would
spoil the illusion.

28:42.239 --> 28:43.809
He's with me.

28:43.799 --> 28:46.688
I thought you'd been caught.

28:46.679 --> 28:49.466
Madam, manacles are
mere mist to myself and my. . .

28:50.479 --> 28:52.162
. . my mate.

28:52.159 --> 28:53.524
You know about the pigeon?

28:53.519 --> 28:55.749
Yes, Robin and Marian
have gone to get him.

28:55.739 --> 28:57.366
So have Sheriff and Gisborne.

28:57.359 --> 29:00.408
They've got them trapped
up a tree surrounded.

29:00.399 --> 29:02.981
We need to go. Now!

29:02.979 --> 29:04.606
Immediately!

29:07.359 --> 29:09.008
OK, line up!

29:10.719 --> 29:12.960
You, over there!

29:12.959 --> 29:15.029
Let's get him down! Come on! Line up!

29:41.319 --> 29:44.368
Saddle me up another horse -
make it a fast one.

29:44.359 --> 29:45.883
I'll be leaving shortly.

29:51.999 --> 29:55.207
It's just a matter of time now
Hood, start saying your prayers.

29:55.199 --> 29:59.465
If they come any nearer,
they'll get the same.
And I won't be aiming at their feet!

30:01.339 --> 30:04.763
Give me your arrows.
It's not enough.

30:04.759 --> 30:07.739
Well, they don't know that, do they?

30:07.739 --> 30:09.627
Ready? Yeah.

30:09.619 --> 30:11.041
Move!

30:17.299 --> 30:20.439
I'll scream, then I can say
you were holding me hostage.

30:20.439 --> 30:22.703
You didn't scream earlier.
He's not stupid.

30:22.699 --> 30:24.849
I'll deal with this, Marian.

30:27.439 --> 30:29.680
It'll take them hours
to cut down this tree.

30:29.679 --> 30:32.762
And in that time, the gang
will realise something's wrong.

30:32.759 --> 30:35.159
Yeah? They'll come and help.

30:35.159 --> 30:37.002
Come, come.

30:36.999 --> 30:39.103
That's it, stop.

30:40.639 --> 30:43.403
I can't hear an axe.

30:43.399 --> 30:45.606
What are they waiting for?

30:52.039 --> 30:53.927
You know what that is, don't you?

30:53.919 --> 30:56.103
It's pitch.

30:56.099 --> 30:58.920
It burns hot and it burns fast.

31:02.679 --> 31:05.102
Go, go, go!

31:11.099 --> 31:13.522
Much, I think it's this way.
You think?!

31:13.519 --> 31:15.043
Shhh!

31:15.039 --> 31:17.963
Don't tell me to shush!
We're looking for a tree in a forest!

31:17.959 --> 31:20.564
Shut up and listen!

31:20.559 --> 31:22.880
I hope you're ready, Hood!

31:22.879 --> 31:24.642
I'm sensing it's that way.

31:28.559 --> 31:31.301
You tried to cover me in pitch
once, Hood, do you remember?

31:34.179 --> 31:37.148
Tried to cover me alive
in my own armour. Yeah!

31:37.139 --> 31:39.619
I should have gone through with it!

31:39.619 --> 31:41.359
Talking trees are good.

31:41.359 --> 31:43.930
But burning bushes are better.

31:45.539 --> 31:48.747
I don't see a trough of
water for you to jump into.

31:48.739 --> 31:52.630
If I were bound and gagged
I couldn't scream,
so all we have to do. . .

31:52.619 --> 31:54.883
No! There's no other way!

32:01.179 --> 32:03.181
There's always another way.

32:03.179 --> 32:05.181
Shields!

32:05.179 --> 32:07.784
This is just putting
off the inevitable.

32:07.779 --> 32:10.589
You're not going back to him.
I can do more good in the castle.

32:10.579 --> 32:13.946
Marian, I would rather die
here than have you go back. . .

32:13.939 --> 32:17.363
But if you die now,
my father died for nothing.

32:21.139 --> 32:23.790
Trust me, I'll get us out of this.
No, you won't!

32:23.779 --> 32:25.462
Not without my help.

32:25.459 --> 32:28.269
Look, we're in this together.

32:28.259 --> 32:30.648
Now, tie me up.

32:30.639 --> 32:35.019
Right, listen to me. He's only
got two choices now. Run or burn.

32:35.019 --> 32:37.305
Either way he's finished.

32:37.299 --> 32:41.429
And any bird that leaves those leaves
dies in the sky.

32:41.419 --> 32:43.819
There are too many of them.

32:43.819 --> 32:48.062
What are we going to do?
After "three" open the shield wall.

32:48.059 --> 32:49.344
One.

32:51.699 --> 32:52.802
Two.

32:57.699 --> 32:58.700
Three!

33:10.219 --> 33:11.743
SHE GROANS

33:12.979 --> 33:14.901
Gisborne!

33:14.899 --> 33:18.699
If I die, Marian dies!

33:18.699 --> 33:22.180
No! Move! Marian!

33:26.379 --> 33:27.482
So it's true.

33:29.059 --> 33:30.390
You still love her.

33:30.379 --> 33:33.303
I've found your weakness, Gisborne.

33:33.299 --> 33:37.008
If you harm a single hair on her
head, I swear I will kill you!

33:36.999 --> 33:41.459
You'll die more slowly and more
painfully than any man
has ever died before!

33:41.459 --> 33:43.461
Well, I thought that was the point!

33:43.459 --> 33:48.146
No. It would have been relatively
quick and painless. You let me go,
I'll leave her behind.

33:48.139 --> 33:50.266
Untouched.

33:52.699 --> 33:54.223
I'll think about it.

33:58.059 --> 34:01.187
Everybody back! Move!

34:02.539 --> 34:05.428
Well. . .that bought us some time.

34:07.679 --> 34:10.887
Any ideas? We need to make
Robin and Marian disappear.

34:10.879 --> 34:12.801
how do we do that?

34:12.799 --> 34:15.460
A puff of smoke.

34:15.458 --> 34:17.699
Be careful.

34:18.719 --> 34:21.483
Are you all right?

34:21.478 --> 34:23.344
I won't leave you behind.

34:23.339 --> 34:25.443
But we can make him
think that I will.

34:25.438 --> 34:29.261
So now we can all see the famous
Robin Hood for who he really is.

34:29.259 --> 34:33.844
A common coward
using an innocent woman as a hostage.

34:33.839 --> 34:38.003
She's not an innocent,
she's one of you lot!

34:37.998 --> 34:41.583
A pampered parasite
living off the backs of the poor.

34:43.938 --> 34:45.360
(It's nothing personal.)

34:45.359 --> 34:49.329
You can't hide behind her skirts
for ever. Come and fight like a man.

34:49.319 --> 34:51.764
Remove your soldiers, Gisborne!

34:51.759 --> 34:55.922
Or she dies at sundown!

34:55.918 --> 34:58.570
He wouldn't do that, would he?

34:58.559 --> 35:00.800
He's bluffing. This is a siege.

35:00.799 --> 35:03.029
All I have to do is wait.

35:03.019 --> 35:05.089
Well, you can't wait too long,
though.

35:05.079 --> 35:07.559
As soon as the Sheriff
gets back, she's gonna die.

35:14.739 --> 35:16.366
Ready?

35:17.159 --> 35:18.706
Let's go.

35:48.062 --> 35:49.984
The forest's on fire.

35:49.982 --> 35:51.631
It's a smoke screen.

35:51.622 --> 35:53.510
You, you and you! Find the fire!

35:53.502 --> 35:55.709
Put it out!
His men are in the forest.

35:55.702 --> 35:57.829
Surround the tree. Move!

35:59.982 --> 36:03.270
Make sure you see the man on
either side of you at all times.

36:04.462 --> 36:06.350
Right, close in the circle,
move in!

36:14.582 --> 36:15.606
(Yes!)

36:15.602 --> 36:17.945
I know what you're doing, Hood,
and it won't work.

36:17.942 --> 36:21.332
We're ready for you.
Ready and waiting.

36:25.262 --> 36:27.389
It's from Will.

36:27.382 --> 36:28.724
He's got a plan.

36:29.922 --> 36:31.105
Here.

36:39.122 --> 36:40.862
Good. Horses.

36:40.862 --> 36:42.466
LITTLE JOHN WHISTLES

36:45.022 --> 36:47.263
You'll have to put
your arms around me.

36:47.262 --> 36:54.304
No, I'm not coming. Marian,
we haven't got time for this!

36:54.302 --> 36:57.749
I'm staying here
until you get away safely.

36:58.902 --> 37:01.632
This is about Gisborne, isn't it?

37:01.622 --> 37:03.624
No.

37:03.622 --> 37:07.069
Inside us, we both
know we belong together.

37:07.062 --> 37:11.249
And being apart will tear me apart
but I'm more use in the castle.

37:11.242 --> 37:13.312
I can protect you better from there.

37:13.302 --> 37:15.748
It's our only hope.

37:15.742 --> 37:18.063
Trust me.

37:21.382 --> 37:24.146
Give me your hand.

37:24.142 --> 37:26.269
No. Just give me your hand.

37:26.262 --> 37:27.752
Is this a trick?

37:36.062 --> 37:37.552
It's an engagement ring.

37:45.302 --> 37:48.044
This afternoon we had a plan.

37:48.042 --> 37:50.784
Yes, find Lardner
and bring the King home.

37:50.782 --> 37:55.367
Defeat the Sheriff and get
married - in that order, Robin.

37:55.362 --> 38:00.208
First things first.
This isn't what I want to do.

38:00.202 --> 38:02.272
It's what I have to do.

38:05.582 --> 38:08.426
I love you. I love you too.

38:37.602 --> 38:40.412
Let's just get out of here.
Has Will got everything? Yes.

38:40.402 --> 38:42.643
Help! Somebody please help me!

38:42.642 --> 38:45.406
Robin's gone. Get after him.

38:45.402 --> 38:48.166
Do not let him release that bird.

38:48.162 --> 38:50.813
50 to the man who kills the pigeon.

38:50.802 --> 38:55.762
He's left me up here
to die, help me! Please!

38:55.762 --> 38:58.344
Is the note ready? Yeah.

38:58.342 --> 39:00.128
Where's Marian? She's fine.

39:00.122 --> 39:04.365
Just get out of here and don't
let that bird go until you're
out of range, all right?

39:10.002 --> 39:11.606
SHE GROANS

39:14.082 --> 39:16.243
Marian, I'm coming! Marian. . .

39:18.922 --> 39:22.210
Nearly there. Marian, hold on!

39:22.202 --> 39:26.810
SHE WHIMPERS: Hurry up!

39:31.042 --> 39:33.488
It's all right, I've got you.

39:33.482 --> 39:35.006
I've got you.

39:37.602 --> 39:39.263
You're coming home with me.

39:41.702 --> 39:43.442
(You're safe now.)

39:50.002 --> 39:51.003
Release the bird!

39:51.002 --> 39:52.503
Release it!

40:21.122 --> 40:22.726
Come on!

40:36.022 --> 40:37.523
And fetch.

41:14.542 --> 41:16.203
Cheer up.

41:16.202 --> 41:18.966
What have I got to be cheery about?
Well, we've got a visitor.

41:22.702 --> 41:25.591
Him!

41:25.582 --> 41:27.607
It's Lardner. Say hello.

41:28.742 --> 41:29.868
You're joking?

41:30.902 --> 41:36.351
When you want something to
disappear, the trick is to
divert the audience attention.

41:36.342 --> 41:40.108
He switched the birds.
I Just happened to have
a spare stuck up my sleeve.

41:40.102 --> 41:43.390
Should've attached a verse
of the note to the decoy bird.

41:43.382 --> 41:45.964
Nah. Would've just weighed him down.

41:45.962 --> 41:50.467
Um. Yes, speaking of decoy birds,
is Marian all right with Gisborne?

41:50.462 --> 41:53.306
Yeah, she'll be fine.

41:53.302 --> 41:55.805
She can look after herself.

41:58.162 --> 42:01.507
Well, hey.
Do you want to do the honours?

42:01.502 --> 42:03.390
At least we have some hope now.

42:03.382 --> 42:05.270
Yeah.

42:05.262 --> 42:06.752
Thanks to Lardner.

42:08.382 --> 42:10.589
Good luck, my friend,

42:10.582 --> 42:12.868
and safe journey home.

42:31.982 --> 42:34.223
The Sheriff's missing.
Missing? Find him.

42:34.222 --> 42:36.383
Nottingham is about to be flattened.

42:36.382 --> 42:40.546
I don't think Robin Hood is the
problem. He might be the solution.

42:40.542 --> 42:42.351
Ask.

42:42.342 --> 42:43.388
Nooooo!

42:43.382 --> 42:46.033
Marry me now.
And make it the last thing we do.

42:46.022 --> 42:48.752
Who are you?
I am the man with the plan.

42:48.742 --> 42:51.267
The Sheriff is heading for the camp.
It's time. . .

42:51.262 --> 42:52.308
Get those gates open!

42:54.582 --> 42:56.630
They're coming, they're coming! !
