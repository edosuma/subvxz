28:06.118 --> 28:08.686
Nobody cares about
what Charlie would like.

28:09.755 --> 28:10.988
(SNIFFS)

28:12.124 --> 28:13.357
Mmm.

28:18.597 --> 28:20.964
Can we go tonight?

28:21.500 --> 28:23.367

28:38.718 --> 28:40.417
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

28:53.132 --> 28:54.698
(DENNIS CHUCKLES)

28:55.000 --> 28:58.969
Hey, Dennis.
Remember me? Patty?

28:59.105 --> 29:02.272
Yeah, yeah, sure. How are you?

29:03.342 --> 29:05.576
This is my friend Emma.

29:13.018 --> 29:15.519
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

29:20.559 --> 29:22.359
-Hey.
-PATTY: Hey.

29:22.795 --> 29:24.762
-You going?
-Yeah.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.463
Well, you coming back?

29:26.465 --> 29:27.998
I don't know.

29:28.334 --> 29:29.767
Are we?

29:29.969 --> 29:31.635
DENNIS: Yeah, you are.

29:32.138 --> 29:33.804
I'm a wreck.

29:33.806 --> 29:35.839
I'm never a wreck.

29:39.378 --> 29:42.579
-(CHUCKLES)
-Well, thanks for this.

29:42.848 --> 29:44.548
We had a lot of fun.

29:44.850 --> 29:46.183
Yeah.

30:03.369 --> 30:06.003
Charlie's gonna love it here.

30:16.749 --> 30:21.518

Oh.

30:35.034 --> 30:36.733
You're not dressed.

30:36.735 --> 30:39.236
Mmm, maybe you should be
the detective.

30:39.638 --> 30:41.805
We're going to see Walt?

30:41.807 --> 30:44.308
-Saturday.
-It is Saturday.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.376
Is it?

30:46.378 --> 30:47.978
GRACE: Hello, Opal.

30:58.057 --> 30:59.656
GRACE: You sure
I can't get you anything?

30:59.658 --> 31:03.260
-So, you live here now?
-Well, no, not really.

31:03.262 --> 31:05.529
Well, I heard
that you married some lawyer.

31:05.531 --> 31:10.434
Diamond like that
sure didn't come from Sam.

31:11.203 --> 31:11.768
It's complicated.

31:11.770 --> 31:17.608
OPAL: You're stepping out
on your husband to ball mine.
How's that complicated?

31:17.776 --> 31:20.611
I'm just surprised
it didn't happen sooner.

31:20.613 --> 31:23.547
He never got over you.
I mean, why would he?

31:23.549 --> 31:26.283
Prettiest girl
at the country club.

31:26.285 --> 31:29.019
It was like you and him
are out of a movie.

31:29.021 --> 31:31.154
And now you're back together.

31:32.157 --> 31:34.391
And all of this.

31:34.393 --> 31:35.926
It's yours.

31:36.328 --> 31:39.062
Okay. Let's go.

31:42.468 --> 31:44.034
Congratulations.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.178
Congratulations.

31:59.018 --> 32:01.018
-(SIGHS)
-(DOOR CLOSES)

32:03.422 --> 32:06.290
They dropped the charges
for treason.

32:08.027 --> 32:09.726
Honey, it's over.

32:13.032 --> 32:13.630
What?

32:13.632 --> 32:17.401
They could give me life
just for deserting.

32:17.403 --> 32:19.102
By not charging me
with treason,

32:19.104 --> 32:20.304
they don't
have to put anything

32:20.306 --> 32:21.571
I stole into evidence.

32:21.573 --> 32:24.441
Well, why wouldn't they
want to put that in evidence?

32:24.443 --> 32:27.744
These were illegal
incursions, Opal.

32:27.746 --> 32:29.112
War crimes.

32:29.381 --> 32:32.382
Look, as soon
as the <i> Times</i> publishes
what you gave them...

32:32.384 --> 32:35.552
Dad, Salazar's had
the documents a month.

32:35.921 --> 32:36.853
And now with Tet,

32:36.855 --> 32:39.723
the Pentagon is in full
damage control.

32:40.926 --> 32:43.660
They're never gonna
run the story.

32:45.097 --> 32:48.598
SAM: Salazar quit?
And you're not
running the story?

32:48.600 --> 32:52.102
No. We killed the story,
so, he quit.

32:52.104 --> 32:55.772
Do you know where he is?
The <i> Times</i> isn't
the only paper.

32:55.774 --> 32:58.675
The Pentagon
will sue, prosecute,

32:58.677 --> 33:00.811
and jail anyone
who runs this story.

33:00.813 --> 33:04.414
So, you're telling me
that because it's true,

33:04.416 --> 33:06.350
because it's backed up
by actual facts

33:06.352 --> 33:09.052
that my son risked his life
handing you,

33:09.054 --> 33:10.120
because every charge
he's making

33:10.122 --> 33:13.390
against the United States
Army is true,

33:13.392 --> 33:14.358
that you're burying the story.

33:14.360 --> 33:17.561
Look, for what it's worth,
I hate this.

33:17.930 --> 33:18.428
A lot of us do,

33:18.430 --> 33:21.298
but no one can afford
to publish this story.

33:21.300 --> 33:23.166
Not right now.

33:23.669 --> 33:26.370
(SIGHS) I'm sorry, Detective.

you have the same soul.

Do you people ever get pale?
(LAUGHS)

34:07.012 --> 34:07.944
Shut up, Charlie.

Whatever you say.

Hey, man, Ralph!

34:14.653 --> 34:16.219

34:16.221 --> 34:19.389

I can't wake him!

34:29.601 --> 34:32.369
Ralph, come on, man.

34:32.671 --> 34:34.838
Let's get you upstairs.

34:35.307 --> 34:37.908
There must be
some Alka-Seltzer

34:37.910 --> 34:39.843
around here someplace.

(SCRAPING)

35:08.107 --> 35:14.244
Sam, at the risk of sounding
like the generation we hate,

35:15.447 --> 35:17.380
you gotta talk.

35:18.117 --> 35:22.819
Grace, I would kill a man for
cutting you off in traffic,

35:23.155 --> 35:25.322
but don't ask me for that.

35:25.324 --> 35:29.326
Talk. It's what I can't.

35:30.562 --> 35:34.131
I mean, can't you just
read my mind?

35:35.601 --> 35:37.567
You always could.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.238
Yes.

35:43.942 --> 35:45.642
I see it.

35:47.112 --> 35:49.579
One word, over and over.

35:50.215 --> 35:52.516
One little four-letter word.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.952
Does it begin with an "F"?

35:55.954 --> 35:58.488
(CHUCKLES) It does not.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.093
Walt.

36:09.434 --> 36:12.469
SAM: You were right about
the <i> LA Times.</i>

36:12.471 --> 36:14.938
You were right
about everything.

36:15.107 --> 36:17.107
It's doing me wonders.

36:17.309 --> 36:19.209
-Hmm.
-(CHUCKLES)

36:20.712 --> 36:22.646
I've got one move.

36:22.948 --> 36:27.017
It's a drug case. It's big.
Keeps getting bigger.
Multiple homicides.

36:27.019 --> 36:30.620
The chief suspect
is a U.S. Army captain
who's been smuggling heroin

36:30.622 --> 36:34.024
from Vietnam in the caskets
of dead soldiers.

36:34.326 --> 36:35.926
What does that
have to do with me?

36:35.928 --> 36:37.394
You're in here because
you have evidence

36:37.396 --> 36:40.430
that the Army is lying
to the American people.

36:40.432 --> 36:42.832
What if I bust a murderous,
dope-smuggling,

36:42.834 --> 36:46.469
decorated Army captain
who's been lying to the Army?

36:46.838 --> 36:48.171
They'd bury it.

36:48.173 --> 36:51.508
-Deeper than me.
-Yes, and maybe they will.

36:51.510 --> 36:53.243
Or maybe I hold on
to that officer,

36:53.245 --> 36:58.014
and maybe the government
gets the message that they
should cut a deal with you

36:58.016 --> 37:01.318
or else the arresting officer,
your father,

37:01.320 --> 37:04.187
will hold a big, nasty
press conference.

37:06.024 --> 37:10.026
(SOFTLY) Dad, these people...

37:11.230 --> 37:14.397
-You don't want to do this.
-No, I don't.

37:14.399 --> 37:17.567
But this is where
we find ourselves right now.

37:17.569 --> 37:19.369
Okay, in the meantime,
just be quiet,

37:19.371 --> 37:25.242
keep a low profile,
"Yes, sir. No, sir."
Say very little.

37:26.111 --> 37:27.444
Okay.

37:28.580 --> 37:31.448
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

37:42.527 --> 37:44.728
(CHUCKLES) Oh, Ralph.

37:45.230 --> 37:46.863
Look at you.

37:46.865 --> 37:49.432
You should call
the doctor, man.

Good, wasn't it?

39:07.112 --> 39:09.045
See, the key is...

39:09.047 --> 39:10.280
See, every time,

39:10.282 --> 39:14.084
the key is fresh ingredients.

are waiting for you.

pastures of the Lord.

Charlie, what did I do
to all those people?

40:20.619 --> 40:22.719
We have to tell someone.

Think they'll be
understanding, huh?

40:37.869 --> 40:38.735
Come on, child.

40:38.737 --> 40:43.807
What are you gonna say?
You killed all those people?

40:44.509 --> 40:45.942
No.

40:47.345 --> 40:49.879
They killed themselves.

40:50.015 --> 40:54.484
They died of greed
and violence.

We're your family.
