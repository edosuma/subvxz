ADULT SHELDON: Previously on
Young Sheldon...I love you.

00:12.751 --> 00:17.017
Veronica.
Hey, Georgie.
What's up?

00:17.060 --> 00:18.322
We're friends, right?

00:18.366 --> 00:21.108
What do you mean?I've asked you out
a bunch,

00:21.151 --> 00:23.066
and you've made it pretty clear
you weren't interested.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.721
B-Before I asked out
another girl,

00:25.764 --> 00:28.289
I just wanted
to make sure that...It's fine.

00:28.332 --> 00:30.813
Guess I'll see you around.

00:31.857 --> 00:33.120
Yep.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.170
♪ You better wait,
don't go away now, darling ♪

00:40.214 --> 00:42.085
♪ Wait...

00:42.129 --> 00:43.913
ADULT SHELDON:
Of all my many skills,

00:43.956 --> 00:46.785
one of the lesser known
is my impressive ability

00:46.829 --> 00:48.483
to wait for things.

00:48.526 --> 00:52.095
I once stood perfectly still
for 38 minutes

00:52.139 --> 00:54.097
because a bee
was on my shoulder.

00:56.534 --> 00:59.711
I once waited
four and a half hours

00:59.755 --> 01:01.452
to be released from a locker.

01:01.496 --> 01:03.976
SHELDON:
Hello? Anyone there?

01:04.020 --> 01:06.066
♪ You better wait,
don't go away now, darling... ♪

01:06.109 --> 01:08.024
That's okay. I'll wait.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.809
ADULT SHELDON:
And one time, when Dr. Sturgis
was late for a lecture,

01:10.853 --> 01:13.856
I stayed longer than everyone.

01:13.899 --> 01:15.118
Where are you all going?

01:15.162 --> 01:16.424
Professor's not here.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.469
I can teach the class.

01:20.645 --> 01:23.126
I just need a
box to stand on.

01:23.170 --> 01:24.606
♪ You better wait.

01:26.216 --> 01:27.783
Dr. Sturgis?

01:27.826 --> 01:30.133
Hello, Sheldon.
What brings you here?

01:30.177 --> 01:32.004
You never showed up
to class.

01:32.048 --> 01:33.093
Whoops.

01:33.136 --> 01:35.356
Time flies when
you're having fun.

01:35.399 --> 01:38.054
What could be more fun
than giving a physics lecture?

01:38.098 --> 01:40.143
Finishing a
physics paper.

01:40.187 --> 01:43.146
Ooh, I like
where this is headed.

01:43.190 --> 01:48.195
I'm exploring the notion
that time itself is quantized.

01:48.238 --> 01:49.674
Interesting.

01:49.718 --> 01:52.155
That sounds like a step towards
a unified field theory.

01:52.199 --> 01:53.504
Fingers crossed.

01:55.027 --> 01:58.422
Although I can't cross
my fingers-- arthritis.

02:04.211 --> 02:07.344
It's too dark back here.
Do you have a flashlight?

02:07.388 --> 02:09.303
In the glove
box, I think.

02:09.346 --> 02:10.956
Can you pass it back?

02:11.000 --> 02:12.567
No. I'm driving.

02:12.610 --> 02:14.699
All right. I'm coming up.

02:14.743 --> 02:17.180
Don't crash
while I'm unbuckled.

02:17.224 --> 02:19.269
Really? You need to do this
right now?

02:19.313 --> 02:22.185
It's Dr. Sturgis's
first paper in years.

02:22.229 --> 02:23.708
It's worth risking
head trauma.

02:25.014 --> 02:27.103
Look at you climbing
like a real boy.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.496
Here we go.

02:28.539 --> 02:31.760
"A Reconsideration of the Role
of Time Operators

02:31.803 --> 02:33.153
in Quantum Mechanics."

02:33.196 --> 02:34.458
Grabby title.

02:34.502 --> 02:35.981
Mm. I'll wait for the movie.

02:36.025 --> 02:38.636
Ooh. He's opening with
a critical examination

02:38.680 --> 02:41.509
of the Copenhagen interpretation
of quantum mechanics.

02:41.552 --> 02:43.728
I thought reading in the car
made you nauseous.

02:43.772 --> 02:47.210
That's in the back seat.
Up here I'm fine.

02:50.213 --> 02:52.824

03:20.765 --> 03:23.246
Team meeting with
the other baseball moms.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.900
You're all right

03:24.943 --> 03:27.381
Oh, yeah. Charles is in charge.

03:27.424 --> 03:29.383
Look at this.
I'm talking to an egg.

03:32.342 --> 03:34.257
I brought veggies and ranch.

03:34.301 --> 03:37.652
That's nice. But when I
said "snacks," I mean wine.

03:37.695 --> 03:39.436
Oh.
Don't worry.

03:39.480 --> 03:42.047
I got plenty of
emergency snacks.

All right, let's
get to this.

end of the season.

That's me.Carla, you're a gem.

03:53.276 --> 03:55.931
Mary, that leaves you in charge
of trophies. Any questions?

03:55.974 --> 03:58.107
Actually...Snack time!

03:59.151 --> 04:01.937
There's also, uh, veggies.

04:01.980 --> 04:04.766
JANA: This is nice.

04:04.809 --> 04:08.509
I like to think of Chi-Chi's

04:13.470 --> 04:16.038
So, uh, what do you
like to get here?

04:16.081 --> 04:18.258

04:18.301 --> 04:19.911
It all tastes the same.

04:21.478 --> 04:22.436
Hi. Welcome to...

04:23.611 --> 04:25.526
Oh. Hey, Georgie.

04:25.569 --> 04:26.396
Uh, hi.

04:27.832 --> 04:30.139
I didn't know you worked here.

04:30.182 --> 04:32.446
Well, haven't seen
you in a while.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.449
Oh, uh, you know Jana
from school?

04:35.492 --> 04:38.016
Yeah. Yeah, of course. Hi.

04:38.060 --> 04:39.322
Hi.

04:40.497 --> 04:43.283
So, can I get y'all
started with some drinks?

04:43.326 --> 04:45.763
I'm good with water.

04:45.807 --> 04:48.418
Water sounds great.
Refreshing.

04:48.462 --> 04:51.378
I'm glad Dr. Sturgis
let me read his paper

04:51.421 --> 04:53.075
before he published.

04:53.118 --> 04:54.424
Why is that?

04:54.468 --> 04:56.600
He's getting numbers
for the massive neutrinos

04:56.644 --> 04:59.342
that are in excess of
a hundred giga-electron volts.

04:59.386 --> 05:00.822
Well, good for him.

05:00.865 --> 05:02.258
No, it's embarrassing.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.781
Had a 50-50 shot.

05:03.825 --> 05:05.783
I guess I need to call
and let him know

05:05.827 --> 05:08.264
what a bonehead mistake
he made.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.701
There's probably a
nicer way to say it.

05:10.745 --> 05:13.443
Did you hear how massive
his neutrinos were?

05:13.487 --> 05:15.706
We're well into
bonehead territory.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.665
Sheldon, you don't need
to be rude to him.

05:17.708 --> 05:18.970
When am I rude?

05:20.494 --> 05:22.931
Stay a child
as long as you can.

05:22.974 --> 05:25.063
Adulthood will not
be kind to you.

05:26.413 --> 05:30.547
Neat. The veins on your calf
look like a road map of Texas.

05:32.593 --> 05:35.378
Did you make this taste bad
so Dad would lose weight?

05:38.512 --> 05:40.296
Fine. I'll be polite.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.645
But I still think

05:41.689 --> 05:45.170
we could go to San Antonio
using Meemaw's leg.

05:46.563 --> 05:47.956
Hello?

05:47.999 --> 05:50.132
Dr. Sturgis. It's Sheldon.

05:50.175 --> 05:51.612
I hope you're well.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.570
I am. I just had soup.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.050
SHELDON:
Anyway,

05:55.093 --> 05:57.531
I was just calling to
let you know I read your paper.

05:57.574 --> 05:59.402
Wonderful.
What did you think?

05:59.446 --> 06:02.797
I thought your typing
was very tidy.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.407
Your sentence structure
was impressive.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.714
And your theory was...

06:06.757 --> 06:10.935
not without succeeding
in avoiding success.

06:10.979 --> 06:15.287
Well, Sheldon, uh, you don't
need to beat around the bush.

06:15.331 --> 06:18.813
We're men of science.
Uh, just give it to me straight.

06:18.856 --> 06:21.816
The masses for your neutrinos
are impossible.

06:21.859 --> 06:24.035
Are you sure?

06:24.079 --> 06:27.038
Yes. If they were that heavy,
atoms could not beta decay.

06:27.082 --> 06:29.824
I don't know how I missed that.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.303
I'm such an idiot.

06:31.347 --> 06:34.524
You're not an idiot.
You're just a bonehead.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.836
So you're saying you have
no feelings for her at all?

06:41.879 --> 06:44.012
I wasn't at the restaurant
with her, I was there with you.

06:44.055 --> 06:45.927
That doesn't answer my question!

06:45.970 --> 06:48.190
I was hoping you wouldn't
pick up on that.

06:48.233 --> 06:51.149
Did you take me there
on purpose?

06:51.193 --> 06:52.455
Hold on a second.

06:52.499 --> 06:53.848
Is this one of
those fights

06:53.891 --> 06:55.719
where we end up making
out in the back seat?

06:55.763 --> 06:56.938
No.

06:56.981 --> 06:59.201
That's too bad.

07:07.296 --> 07:09.603
Howdy.

07:09.646 --> 07:12.693
Morning. I need to order
some baseball trophies.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.390
Baseball's over there.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.918
So many choices.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.572
Mm-hmm.

07:22.616 --> 07:26.184
You should win a trophy
for the most trophies.

07:26.228 --> 07:28.796
Mm.

07:30.406 --> 07:32.843
: Maybe not the trophy
for customer service.

07:34.279 --> 07:35.498
Is this everything you have?

07:35.542 --> 07:38.066
Impressive, isn't it?

07:38.109 --> 07:39.589
I noticed that there are
no baseball trophies

07:39.633 --> 07:41.025
with girls on them.

07:41.069 --> 07:42.505
Girls don't
play baseball.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.420
Actually, my
daughter does.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.205
Oh. Good for her.

07:47.249 --> 07:51.209
And some of the girls might like
a trophy with a girl on it.

07:51.253 --> 07:53.429
Well, then they'll be
very disappointed.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.649
You know what?

07:55.692 --> 07:57.912
I'm gonna take my
business elsewhere.

07:57.955 --> 07:59.609
Oh, no.

07:59.653 --> 08:04.440
And you should win a trophy
for being such a sourpuss!

08:04.484 --> 08:07.182
Ta-ta!

08:08.705 --> 08:10.402
Hello?SHELDON: Dr. Sturgis.

08:10.446 --> 08:13.057
It's Sheldon. I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

08:13.101 --> 08:16.191
Nah, just wondering
what became of my career.

08:16.234 --> 08:17.192
Oh.

08:17.235 --> 08:18.715
Should I call you back later?

08:18.759 --> 08:21.239
Oh, no. I can be downtrodden
and chat at the same time.

08:21.283 --> 08:22.458
What's up?

08:22.502 --> 08:23.720
I was thinking about

08:23.764 --> 08:25.156
the mass problem
of your neutrinos,

08:25.200 --> 08:27.115
and I realized
we might be able to solve it

08:27.158 --> 08:29.204
if some of the particles
have more spin.

08:29.247 --> 08:30.771
Interesting.

08:30.814 --> 08:32.163
That would certainly

08:32.207 --> 08:34.557
get our neutrino mass to zero.

08:34.601 --> 08:38.343
Although it does
open up a problem

08:38.387 --> 08:40.302
with double beta decay.

08:40.345 --> 08:42.565
Hmm. That is true.

08:42.609 --> 08:45.133
Unless what it's
actually predicting

08:45.176 --> 08:46.874
is a magnetic monopole.

08:46.917 --> 08:50.530
Might be difficult
to control the infinities.

08:50.573 --> 08:51.966
Although,

08:52.009 --> 08:55.186
if you consider adding
faster-than-light particles

08:55.230 --> 08:59.147
like tachyons,
then I suppose you could...

08:59.190 --> 09:01.628
Quantize time.STURGIS: Yes!

09:01.671 --> 09:04.848
Hang on! If we're gonna be
thinking at this level,

09:04.892 --> 09:07.068
I should put on pants!

09:09.461 --> 09:11.376
Can you believe this?

09:11.420 --> 09:13.335
Boy trophy,
boy trophy...

09:13.378 --> 09:14.641
boy trophy.

09:14.684 --> 09:17.469
Hmm, all I see
is my trophy wife.

09:17.513 --> 09:19.384
Nope? Okay.

09:19.428 --> 09:20.516
Look, the only
girl trophies

09:20.560 --> 09:23.345
are for cheerleading,
soccer and golf.

09:23.388 --> 09:26.914
So buy Missy a golf trophy
and tell her it's a skinny bat.

09:26.957 --> 09:28.480
George.

09:28.524 --> 09:31.483
That poor girl has been
watching her brother win awards

09:31.527 --> 09:33.877
since he was
three years old.

09:33.921 --> 09:36.576
I'd like for her
first one to be special.

09:36.619 --> 09:39.274
'Cause you think
it may also be her last one?

09:39.317 --> 09:40.667
I didn't say that.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.494
But you thought it.

09:42.538 --> 09:43.626
Yeah.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.367
Mm.

09:48.065 --> 09:49.501

09:51.329 --> 09:54.115
What's this?It's your tip from
the other night.

09:54.158 --> 09:55.725
I wanted to give it to you then,

09:55.769 --> 09:58.510
but I also wanted
to get out of there alive.

09:58.554 --> 09:59.903
Don't worry about it.

09:59.947 --> 10:01.078
You sure?

10:01.122 --> 10:03.037
I'm sure.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.648
So how long you been
working there?

10:05.692 --> 10:08.651
Couple weeks. Trying
to save money for college.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.087
Well, now you have
to take this.

10:10.131 --> 10:11.349
I insist.

10:12.394 --> 10:13.961
Thank you.

10:14.004 --> 10:15.397
How are things with Jana?

10:15.440 --> 10:18.269
Honestly, I have no idea.

10:18.313 --> 10:20.924
Should you even be
talking to me right now?

10:20.968 --> 10:22.273
Probably not.

10:23.753 --> 10:26.408
But I'm glad I am.

10:28.366 --> 10:30.368
Me, too.

10:32.196 --> 10:34.024
Bye.

10:35.678 --> 10:39.813
STURGIS:
I'd like to end today's lecture
with a hilarious physics joke.

10:39.856 --> 10:44.426
Why didn't the photon
pack a suitcase?

10:44.469 --> 10:47.429
He was traveling light.

10:48.996 --> 10:50.693
Sheldon.
Ha, ha.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.477
Thank you.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.436
Class dismissed.

10:55.306 --> 10:58.962
Well, our conversation
about my paper

10:59.006 --> 11:02.966
resulted in a very
productive couple of days.

11:03.010 --> 11:07.841
I completely rewrote the
whole thing from scratch.

11:07.884 --> 11:10.844
Exciting. I know credits are
usually listed alphabetically,

11:10.887 --> 11:14.064
but I'm completely fine
with my name going second.

11:14.108 --> 11:17.546
Sheldon, I've worked
on this paper for years.

11:17.589 --> 11:20.331
I'm not putting your name
on it at all.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.072
But I helped you.

11:22.116 --> 11:25.728
You did, but you didn't
cowrite the paper with me.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.861
Is that so?

11:27.904 --> 11:29.427
Yes, it is.

11:29.471 --> 11:31.081
Well, this is an outrage.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.474
After all the help
I've given you,

11:32.517 --> 11:33.736
and I don't even
get credit?

11:33.780 --> 11:36.347
Well, of course you are.

11:36.391 --> 11:39.350
You're getting a special
thanks in the footnotes.

11:39.394 --> 11:40.830
No one reads the footnotes.

11:40.874 --> 11:42.745
I do.Well, I do, too,

11:42.789 --> 11:45.139
but that doesn't mean
I want to be in them.Sheldon,

11:45.182 --> 11:48.446
that's where people get
recognition for helping.

11:48.490 --> 11:50.361
Oh, you mean the help
of using my math

11:50.405 --> 11:52.407
to convert your hazy series
of meanderings

11:52.450 --> 11:54.322
into a well-formed
scientific thesis?

11:54.365 --> 11:57.325
I think you're overstating
your contribution.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.544
Well, I think you should be
wearing a black ski mask

11:59.588 --> 12:01.503
because you're trying
to rob me blind.

12:01.546 --> 12:05.376
Well, if anyone should be
wearing an odd piece of apparel,

12:05.420 --> 12:08.031
it should be you
wearing a baby bonnet,

12:08.075 --> 12:10.294
because that's how
you're behaving.

12:11.382 --> 12:13.558
Ready to go?
Very!

12:14.603 --> 12:15.822
It's a good thing she showed up,

12:15.865 --> 12:17.693
because I do not
have a comeback.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.049
Darn it. When he called me
a baby, I should've said,

12:26.093 --> 12:30.184
"Then I guess you needed a
baby's help to fix your paper."

12:30.227 --> 12:31.794
Very clever.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.013
Turn the car around.

12:33.056 --> 12:34.928
We're halfway home.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.581
It's not that clever.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.845
Why aren't you being
more supportive of me?

12:38.888 --> 12:42.196
Sheldon, John is a lot of
things, but he's not a thief.

12:42.239 --> 12:43.588
So you're on his side.

12:43.632 --> 12:44.807
I'm not.

12:44.851 --> 12:45.895
So you're on my side.

12:45.939 --> 12:48.855
For the sake
of this car ride, sure.

12:50.421 --> 12:51.945
Okay, here's the plan.

12:51.988 --> 12:54.251
End your relationship
with Coach Ballard,

12:54.295 --> 12:56.601
date Dr. Sturgis again,
get him to love you

12:56.645 --> 12:59.387
more than ever,
then when he least expects it,

12:59.430 --> 13:02.651
break his heart and say,
"That's for Sheldon."

13:02.694 --> 13:03.957
Great plan.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.045
You think so?

13:05.088 --> 13:08.918
For the sake
of this car ride, sure.

13:08.962 --> 13:11.181
So shiny, aren't you, now?

13:12.443 --> 13:14.315
Hello. Remember me?

13:14.358 --> 13:17.927
Ah, I thought you were gonna
take your business elsewhere.

13:17.971 --> 13:20.930
Well, lucky for you,
I believe in second chances.

13:22.845 --> 13:27.981
Now, I know that you don't have
girl baseball trophies in stock,

13:28.024 --> 13:30.157
but could you have one
made special?

13:30.200 --> 13:31.419
Sure.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.725
Great.A custom mold

13:33.769 --> 13:36.903
is 50 bucks,
and it takes six weeks.

13:36.946 --> 13:39.688
I'm not paying you $50
for a trophy.

13:39.731 --> 13:41.385
And I don't have six weeks.

13:41.429 --> 13:43.910
Well, does your daughter
look like a horse?

13:43.953 --> 13:45.607
Maybe she'd like this.

13:49.872 --> 13:53.354
I knew all that God talk was
covering something really evil.

13:56.923 --> 13:59.186
I am trying to make
a special trophy for Missy.

13:59.229 --> 14:03.103
So I'm gonna take this head
and put it on that body.

14:03.146 --> 14:05.105
Whatever you say,
Dr. Frankenstein.

14:06.367 --> 14:08.412
My daughter deserves
to have a trophy

14:08.456 --> 14:10.284
that looks something like her.

14:10.327 --> 14:13.896
So this is kind of
a feminist gesture on your part.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.856
I prefer to think of it
as a maternal gesture.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.466
Let's just split the difference

14:18.509 --> 14:20.511
and call it
the stuff of nightmares.

14:20.555 --> 14:22.905
It'll look better
when I paint it.

14:22.949 --> 14:24.994
I don't think so.

14:31.218 --> 14:32.393
Grant Linkletter.

14:32.436 --> 14:33.916
SHELDON:
Dr. Linkletter, Sheldon Cooper.

14:33.960 --> 14:36.484
I need your help reporting
an academic crime.

14:36.527 --> 14:37.572
Sounds serious.

14:37.615 --> 14:38.747
It is.

14:38.790 --> 14:40.183
That's why I'm using
my serious voice.

14:40.227 --> 14:41.881
Then I'll use mine as well.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.361
What's going on?

14:44.405 --> 14:45.928
Dr. Sturgis has stolen my work

14:45.972 --> 14:47.930
and is using it
in his own paper.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.453
Well, that's quite
the allegation.

14:49.497 --> 14:52.065
It's not an allegation;
it's a fact.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.849
He was getting enormous masses
for his neutrinos,

14:53.893 --> 14:55.503
and I showed him how to fix it,

14:55.546 --> 14:58.288
but now he's refusing
to list me as a coauthor.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.290
Well, I think he has a point.

15:00.334 --> 15:01.901
Is the "he" in that sentence me?

15:01.944 --> 15:04.164
Because that is a strange way
to phrase it.

15:04.207 --> 15:05.382
No, the "he" is him.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.254
I don't play games
with sentence structure.

15:07.297 --> 15:09.560
Look, I haven't done a forensic
examination of this paper,

15:09.604 --> 15:11.998
but it's not uncommon
to show your work to a colleague

15:12.041 --> 15:13.390
to get their feedback.

15:13.434 --> 15:15.175
But I fixed his paper.

15:15.218 --> 15:18.091
This kind of accusation
could have real consequences.

15:18.134 --> 15:20.658
I'd consider my next steps
very carefully.

15:20.702 --> 15:23.183
You're no help. Put me through
to your supervisor.

15:23.226 --> 15:24.314
Please let me speak to John

15:24.358 --> 15:26.099
before you take this
any further.

15:26.142 --> 15:29.493
All right, but if he calls me
a baby, feel free to say,

15:29.537 --> 15:32.279
"Then I guess you needed a baby
to fix your paper."

15:32.322 --> 15:36.022
That's a good one,
but I'm not gonna say it.

15:38.154 --> 15:41.114
I bet the guy who invented
the spork is a millionaire.

15:41.157 --> 15:42.289
I guess.

15:42.332 --> 15:44.291
I wonder if his last name
is Spork.

15:44.334 --> 15:47.990
It comes from "spoon"
and "fork." Spork.

15:48.034 --> 15:50.993
Oh, my God. Mind is blown.

16:01.569 --> 16:03.527
You know what you should do?
Cut your hair.

16:03.571 --> 16:04.702
What?

16:04.746 --> 16:06.095
I think it'd look better.

16:06.139 --> 16:08.402
Ooh, maybe a little beard
like George Michael.

16:08.445 --> 16:11.361
I wonder how tall he is.
I bet he's tall.

16:17.367 --> 16:20.022
Hey. I have something
to show you.

16:20.066 --> 16:21.110
What's up?

16:21.154 --> 16:23.112
I was gonna give this to you

16:23.156 --> 16:25.114
at the end of the season party,

16:25.158 --> 16:29.031
but I was so excited
that I wanted you to see it now.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.206
Mm.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.775
What the hell is that?

16:33.818 --> 16:36.125
I couldn't find
any girl baseball trophies,

16:36.169 --> 16:37.866
so I made you one.

16:37.909 --> 16:39.172
Why is her head so big?

16:39.215 --> 16:42.001
It's a Barbie head.
I had to improvise.

16:42.044 --> 16:44.003
You chopped the head
off one of my Barbies?

16:44.046 --> 16:46.744
Don't be silly.
I bought a new one.

16:46.788 --> 16:48.224
I could've had a new Barbie?

16:48.268 --> 16:53.534
The point is you deserve
to be recognized appropriately

16:53.577 --> 16:55.623
for everything
you've accomplished.

16:55.666 --> 16:58.321
You can't give that to me
in front of all the boys.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.976
Why?
It's embarrassing.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.109
Well, we have plenty of time.

17:03.152 --> 17:07.939
I can make the head smaller
or the body bigger

17:07.983 --> 17:10.116
or a little bit of both.

17:10.159 --> 17:12.466
I just want the same trophy
everyone else gets.

17:12.509 --> 17:15.034
But I want you to feel special.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.775
And I just want to feel regular.

17:19.516 --> 17:21.257
Okay.

17:21.301 --> 17:24.086
Well...

17:24.130 --> 17:26.784
I'll make sure you get
a regular one at the party.

17:26.828 --> 17:28.786
Thank you.

17:32.703 --> 17:33.965
Mom, wait.

17:36.185 --> 17:38.361
I get what you were
trying to do.

17:40.363 --> 17:42.017
It's nice.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.802
Thanks.

17:44.846 --> 17:46.369
Can I keep that one, too?

17:47.414 --> 17:49.155
You really want it?

17:49.198 --> 17:51.505
I do.

17:57.946 --> 18:00.122
ADULT SHELDON:
Despite her many flaws,

18:00.166 --> 18:02.733
my sister did have a soft spot
in her heart.

18:04.518 --> 18:06.476
And a fondness
for blowing things up.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.490
MARY:
What was that?!

18:32.023 --> 18:33.373
Hello?

18:33.416 --> 18:36.289
How dare you accuse me
of plagiarism?

18:36.332 --> 18:38.291
And to my colleague, no less.

18:38.334 --> 18:41.990
This is my reputation
you're jeopardizing.

18:42.033 --> 18:44.949
Well, give me the credit
I deserve and I'll stop.

18:44.993 --> 18:46.603
We've been over this.

18:46.647 --> 18:50.955
You made a helpful suggestion
and then you arrogantly assumed

18:50.999 --> 18:53.784
that it entitled you
to a coauthor credit,

18:53.828 --> 18:55.569
which it doesn't.

18:55.612 --> 18:56.787
But I was the one who...

18:56.831 --> 18:58.180
I've been your friend

18:58.224 --> 18:59.355
and mentor.

18:59.399 --> 19:02.184
The idea that I would
steal from you

19:02.228 --> 19:06.841
is both personally
and professionally insulting.

19:06.884 --> 19:09.844
Well, I'm sorry
you feel that way, but...

19:09.887 --> 19:14.022
Sheldon, I don't want to see you
in my class anymore.

19:18.461 --> 19:19.941
