01:16.633 --> 01:18.800
- Are you all right, Erin?
- Yeah.

01:20.300 --> 01:24.033
Think your mom would let us have any of
this stuff for the school rummage sale?

01:24.533 --> 01:26.933

- You're not fooling anybody, Noah.
- What are you doing here?

What's with you guys?

03:09.800 --> 03:12.467
- Max, you were gone.
- Don't be stupid.

03:12.967 --> 03:15.200
That flash of light must have
fried your eyeballs, that's all.

03:15.200 --> 03:18.100
You were invisible.

03:18.100 --> 03:20.367
- Yeah, you were.
- You really were.

03:21.300 --> 03:24.067
Wow. Invisible.

03:24.067 --> 03:29.067
- Must have been that mirror.
- No wonder this room got sealed up.

We tell no one.
Swear?

You can't swear with your left hand.
It doesn't count.

03:37.833 --> 03:40.067
It does for me.
Left-handers.

03:40.067 --> 03:44.767
Left-handers rule. I know.

If Dad wakes up, you can kiss
this secret room good-bye.

It's something.

05:35.067 --> 05:38.067
You gonna pull it, or am I?

We'll both pull it.

Oh, wow!
You're invisible.

05:47.400 --> 05:50.900

This is too cool.

06:01.067 --> 06:02.900
We could get into the movies for free.

- Cut it out, Noah!

06:14.233 --> 06:18.267
- You're gonna wake Mom and Dad.
- Okay, okay.

06:18.267 --> 06:21.367
I don't feel so great.
I'm kinda dizzy.

Me too-- a little.

06:25.600 --> 06:29.333
- Pretty wild, huh?
- Really wild.

06:29.333 --> 06:31.800
And I'll bet you want
to tell Mom and Dad.

06:31.800 --> 06:35.033
- Guess we have to.
- Not right away.

06:35.033 --> 06:38.533
We can have a little fun before
we start making rules about it.

06:38.533 --> 06:42.967
This is a major discovery,
the chance of a lifetime.

06:42.967 --> 06:47.267
Guess we could hold off,
as long as we tell them eventually.

Yes!

06:55.300 --> 06:58.067
[ Max ] Your dad's gonna
ground you for a whole year.

06:58.067 --> 07:01.500
He didn't care. He had a
ponytail until a month ago.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.867
Didn't it hurt?

07:04.867 --> 07:07.600
If you're thinking about it,
Max, don't bother.

07:08.100 --> 07:09.767
Now, I have to pick some things up.

Whatever this incredible secret
of yours is, it better be good.

Don't worry. It's only the most
incredible discovery in the entire universe.

07:32.167 --> 07:33.933
Yeah, right.

07:34.433 --> 07:38.433
That's the most incredible thing
in the entire universe!

07:41.267 --> 07:43.967
What gives?

07:43.967 --> 07:46.800
I thought this was supposed
to be our super top secret.

07:47.267 --> 07:50.233

Zack swore to keep it a secret.

07:50.733 --> 07:52.800

[ Erin ]
Max, I'm not sure I feel so great.

Where are they?

08:05.167 --> 08:07.667
I thought they were only supposed to
stay invisible when the light was on.

[ Erin ]
Yeah. What's going on?

08:10.433 --> 08:12.900
[ Max ]
Sometimes it takes a couple of seconds.

08:19.233 --> 08:22.500
It's-- It's like
the ultimate secret weapon.

08:22.500 --> 08:26.500
- We could be famous!
- We could invade the girls' washroom.

08:26.500 --> 08:29.000
- [ Chuckling ]
- Grow up, Noah.

08:29.500 --> 08:33.500
Guys, I know this is cool and all,
but we have to be scientific about it.

08:33.500 --> 08:37.533
Yeah.
We could do experiments.

08:37.533 --> 08:41.067
Isn't that sort of dangerous?

08:41.067 --> 08:43.567
Well, how else are we supposed
to understand how it works?

08:43.567 --> 08:46.833
I mean, it seems like each time we do it,
the longer it takes to get back.

08:46.833 --> 08:49.733
There's one way to find out.
We'll time it.

08:49.733 --> 08:53.733
You think we should? It made
me feel weird-- sort of cold.

08:54.233 --> 08:56.600
Well, maybe it's a feeling
you have to get used to.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.567
I'm gonna try it.
Zack, time me.

08:58.567 --> 09:02.233
- You just had a turn.
- This isn't a toy, Noah.

- [ Max ] Kind of.
- What's the matter?

09:18.067 --> 09:21.033
[ Echoing ] I'm not sure.
I feel like I'm drifting or something.

09:21.033 --> 09:23.733
Sounds like he's in a cave.

So strange.

- No way.

Are you okay, bud?

10:34.667 --> 10:37.167
You're freezing cold.

10:37.167 --> 10:39.133
That was something else.

10:39.133 --> 10:42.033
- Max, where'd you go?
- No place.

10:42.033 --> 10:44.500
I was right here, but I wasn't.

10:44.933 --> 10:49.300
Brain freeze.
Total vapor lock.

10:49.300 --> 10:53.233
No.
It was like a strange dream.

10:53.233 --> 10:55.067
Sort of scary.

10:55.067 --> 10:57.967
There's all these bright colors.

10:58.900 --> 11:00.933
It's all kinda fuzzy.

11:03.767 --> 11:05.767
I don't think
we should do it anymore.

11:05.767 --> 11:09.333
Yeah, right!
After you got two turns in a row?

11:09.333 --> 11:12.567
At least you got a turn.
I mean, come on, Max. Just once?

11:12.567 --> 11:15.433
- I'm serious, you guys.
- Max is right.

11:15.433 --> 11:19.500
- It's too risky.
- I can't explain it.

11:19.500 --> 11:22.900
There's something creepy
about it, something not right.

11:24.867 --> 11:25.800
- Promise not to use it anymore.
- Okay.

11:30.600 --> 11:34.100
- What are you looking at me for?
- Promise, Noah.

11:34.600 --> 11:37.100
You want it written
in blood or something?

11:37.100 --> 11:39.100
I promise.

We're starting without you!

11:49.500 --> 11:51.633
When you guys
were growing up here,

11:52.033 --> 11:54.867
did you notice anything
strange about the house?

11:54.867 --> 11:57.000
What's your idea of strange?

11:57.000 --> 12:00.633
Well, it's not haunted
or anything, is it?

12:00.633 --> 12:04.633
Haunted?
Max, you know better than that.

12:13.033 --> 12:15.733
Did you tell your father
about Zack's earring?

12:22.300 --> 12:25.067
Um, what's the big deal?
Zack got an earring.

12:25.067 --> 12:27.967
Well, if you're thinking about it,
don't bother.

Noah, what are you trying to do,
blow this? We had a deal!

13:22.633 --> 13:25.033
[ Echoing ]
I had my fingers crossed.

13:25.033 --> 13:28.467
- Your voice sounds different.
- I don't feel so good either.

13:28.467 --> 13:31.267
Come on.
I'm gonna bring you back.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.367
I'm right here.

13:51.633 --> 13:55.800
- Are you okay?
- Just fine.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.667
You worry too much.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.400
Just leave the mirror alone.
Understand?

14:01.400 --> 14:03.900
Whatever you say, Max.

14:09.667 --> 14:13.900
[ Voice Echoing ]

14:13.900 --> 14:17.200
Max. Just leave it alone.

14:27.833 --> 14:30.833
Hey, Mom. I'm home.

14:30.833 --> 14:33.300
Oh, hi, sweetie. I thought you
were upstairs with the others.

14:33.300 --> 14:35.333
- What others?
- Zack and Erin.

14:35.333 --> 14:38.733
They went up to find you.
Forgot you had baseball.

14:43.367 --> 14:45.667
[ Zack ] Hey, Max.
Where've you been?

14:45.667 --> 14:46.967
Have a seat.

14:46.967 --> 14:48.867
I thought you said we weren't
gonna do this anymore.

14:48.867 --> 14:52.600
Easy for you to say. I never
even got a chance to try it.

14:53.433 --> 14:57.300
I'm sorry, Max.
I tried to talk him out of it.

14:57.300 --> 15:00.000
Look, Zack. Last time I did it,
it was just too weird.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.767
It was like
I was going somewhere.

15:02.767 --> 15:05.767
This mirror's way too dangerous.
I think we should break it.

15:06.333 --> 15:08.767
[ Echoing ] Are you crazy?
This could be worth millions!

15:09.367 --> 15:12.400
- Zack, your voice.
- What about it?

- Oh, Zack.
- Oh, there you are.

15:31.667 --> 15:33.567
You scared me there, bud.

No problem, Max. Come on.
Why don't you try it again?

15:39.133 --> 15:42.033
No. I'm gonna break it.

Don't be such a wimp, Max!
Come on! One last time.

- Come on! Stop it!
- Zack, cut it out!

- Nothing much.

Relax, Max.

It's not like you haven't seen
your own reflection before.

- Where is he?
- Relax. He'll be back soon.

- Not yet.

- Your earring.
- What about it?

It was in your left ear before.

Now it's in the other.

16:54.700 --> 16:56.700
No, it wasn't.

16:59.267 --> 17:02.067
I've been waiting a long time, Max.

17:02.067 --> 17:04.067
Ever since you first
turned on that light.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.933
- Waiting for what?
- To trade places.

17:07.900 --> 17:11.166
Don't make this more difficult
than it has to be.

17:11.166 --> 17:13.133
No!

17:13.567 --> 17:17.032
I'll be the one to leave, Max.

17:17.032 --> 17:19.032
Please don't be a problem.

17:19.532 --> 17:21.300
Your friend gave in so easily.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.433
This world is the real world.

17:25.433 --> 17:28.433
Give in to the cold.
No cares, no worries.

17:28.433 --> 17:30.767
No feelings.

17:30.767 --> 17:33.433
Give in to the cold, Max.

17:33.433 --> 17:38.467
Forget that. Zack! Erin!
Turn off the light!

17:38.467 --> 17:41.567
They can't hear you.
You can't escape me now, Max.

17:41.567 --> 17:43.567
It's switching time.

17:44.067 --> 17:46.367
One by one,
we will bring you here.

17:46.367 --> 17:49.933
It's good here, Max.
The cold is good.

17:49.933 --> 17:53.833
- No!
- [ Laughing ]

18:03.600 --> 18:06.500
[ Panting ]

18:47.833 --> 18:51.533
Max! Max!

18:51.967 --> 18:55.500
Max. It's switching time.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.567
No!

19:07.567 --> 19:09.933
[ Grunts, Groans ]

19:13.500 --> 19:15.267
You're too late!

19:21.467 --> 19:23.767
Max!

19:24.900 --> 19:26.900
Max?

19:28.567 --> 19:32.100
- Break the mirror, Erin.
- [ Gasps ]

19:32.100 --> 19:33.967
[ Grunts ]

19:33.967 --> 19:36.567
- On your feet!
- Zack, stop!

19:37.800 --> 19:39.900
Break the mirror, Erin!
Break it!

19:39.900 --> 19:41.967
[ Grunts ]

19:41.967 --> 19:44.333
[ Erin Screams ]

19:44.333 --> 19:47.833

- [ Erin Screams ]

20:02.367 --> 20:05.233
[ Shivering ]

20:12.200 --> 20:14.200
What happened?

20:14.200 --> 20:16.733
Someone just got
seven years' bad luck.

20:36.033 --> 20:38.533
So, are we gonna tell
Mom and Dad?

20:38.533 --> 20:40.533
I don't think they'd believe us.

20:40.533 --> 20:44.033
I'm gonna seal up that wall so we never
have to set foot in that room again.

20:44.033 --> 20:46.900
You two doing housework?
I better get my camera.

20:46.900 --> 20:50.567
There's a first time
for everything, Dad.

20:51.133 --> 20:52.767
Toss me a cup there, sport.

20:58.433 --> 21:01.433
Since when did you start
throwing with your right hand?

21:02.433 --> 21:04.433
Noah?
