Stay out of---

12:51.140 --> 12:55.427
Zemo. He's gone to you
for help, hasn't he.

12:55.486 --> 12:58.083
I'm giving you one chance.
Surrender.

12:58.185 --> 12:59.745
Huh! Pathetic.

12:59.849 --> 13:02.997
Do you think you aren't
on my list too Iron Man?

13:05.925 --> 13:06.885
Aaagh!

13:11.434 --> 13:12.634
Unh!

13:17.900 --> 13:18.860
Dahhh!

13:22.861 --> 13:24.661
Iron Man would betray me.

13:25.558 --> 13:27.958
All of them would gladly
let the Enchantress

13:27.992 --> 13:30.992
have her vengeance against
me if it suited their needs.

13:31.456 --> 13:33.012
But not you.

13:33.090 --> 13:35.091
Not the noble Captain America.

13:36.198 --> 13:37.758
Isn't that right.

13:38.794 --> 13:40.594
I am ready for Zemo, Captain.

13:42.047 --> 13:43.607
We're on our way.

13:46.221 --> 13:47.259
<i>[PANTHER] Asgardian magic</i>

13:47.290 --> 13:49.760
is in many ways a
science of its own,

13:49.939 --> 13:52.339
another form of
energy manipulation.

13:52.542 --> 13:55.956
This device can shut down the
Enchantress' connection to that energy.

13:56.491 --> 13:57.467
Think it'll work?

13:57.559 --> 13:58.446
I do.

13:58.626 --> 14:01.911
Just as I believe the Avengers
can help you, Wonder Man.

14:02.213 --> 14:05.140
You need not be
under Zemo's control.

14:05.395 --> 14:09.269
This isn't about Zemo.
Stark destroyed my life.

14:10.156 --> 14:13.644
Tony Stark has found a way to
hold your energy form together.

14:14.754 --> 14:16.658
He has found a cure for you.

14:16.784 --> 14:17.744
What?

14:17.807 --> 14:20.363
Zemo is an evil man,
Simon Williams.

14:20.410 --> 14:22.210
I do not believe that you are.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.430
We both know what Zemo
is not going to surrender.

14:25.461 --> 14:26.410
Tell me,

14:26.591 --> 14:29.074
<i>what you think he's going to do.</i>

14:29.129 --> 14:30.447
[automatic door opens]

14:30.988 --> 14:33.038
Impress me, Wakandan.

14:34.981 --> 14:36.541
The plan is simple.

14:36.638 --> 14:38.886
When the Enchantress finds
you here, I will activate

14:38.887 --> 14:40.838
the power dampeners from
the observation room.

14:41.277 --> 14:42.237
No.

14:42.517 --> 14:45.306
Not you. Captain America.

14:45.335 --> 14:45.909
[klaxon]

14:45.955 --> 14:48.091
<i>[JARVIS] Warning. Intruder Alert.</i>

14:48.958 --> 14:50.692
So, it begins.

14:51.419 --> 14:52.619
[knocking]

14:53.280 --> 14:54.480
[growls]

15:00.687 --> 15:01.647
Wait.

15:01.715 --> 15:03.549
Weren't you made of gold an hour ago?

15:03.602 --> 15:06.869
Please, Avengers, you have to help.
They're right behind me!

15:06.904 --> 15:07.529
[rocket launches]

15:07.605 --> 15:08.410
[gasp]

15:08.944 --> 15:10.015
[explosion]

15:15.912 --> 15:17.458
Grrraaaahhhh!

15:25.013 --> 15:26.482
Guys. It's Executioner.

15:26.521 --> 15:28.597
The Hulk and Abomination
are fighting him upstairs.

15:28.902 --> 15:30.296
He was chasing Chemistro.

15:30.657 --> 15:32.217
That is not Chemistro!

15:32.402 --> 15:33.839
Ugh! Ahh!

15:34.682 --> 15:36.242
It's over, Zemo.

15:37.176 --> 15:38.775
Now you pay.

15:39.391 --> 15:41.415
Now you ALL pay.

15:46.850 --> 15:48.050
Uuugh! Auugh!

15:48.608 --> 15:50.168
Yaaahhh! Ooohhh!

16:02.864 --> 16:07.799
Did you really think the Avengers would
fare any better than your worms?

16:08.217 --> 16:08.936
Yes.

16:09.306 --> 16:11.472
Activate the dampeners Captain.

16:15.618 --> 16:16.818
Now Captain!

16:21.749 --> 16:22.949
Captain!

16:23.971 --> 16:25.171
Disappointing.

16:28.254 --> 16:29.766
[fighting]

16:44.855 --> 16:46.479
Sure you want to try this again?

16:46.504 --> 16:48.904
Last time we fought,
all you lost was your axe.

16:49.242 --> 16:51.966
This time, it'll be worse.

16:57.580 --> 16:59.380
[Balder] The Seal of Bor's sons.

17:00.088 --> 17:02.388
But what magic could break it?

17:15.444 --> 17:16.624
Nay.

17:22.690 --> 17:25.089
[Balder] The Twilight Sword is gone.

17:25.549 --> 17:27.949
The barriers to
Muspelheim have fallen.

17:28.610 --> 17:31.191
Surter has returned.

17:33.672 --> 17:37.272
<i>[Enchantress] You life was forfeit
the moment you betrayed me, Zemo.</i>

17:37.451 --> 17:41.616
But what you do now, you
jeopardize all the Nine Realms!

17:41.869 --> 17:46.738
By using the last Norn Stone, you risk
breaking down the walls to Muspelheim itself.

17:46.959 --> 17:49.245
Even Loki dared not use it.

17:49.492 --> 17:52.273
This stone can protect me from your magic.

17:52.427 --> 17:54.265
That's all that matters.

17:56.488 --> 17:57.448
Yahh!

18:01.212 --> 18:03.994
[rumbling]

18:04.189 --> 18:06.098
Rarrhhhh!

18:06.476 --> 18:08.478
Executioner! I need you!

18:09.158 --> 18:10.718
[Hulk] Rarrhhh!

18:18.672 --> 18:21.654
Give me the Norn Stone, Zemo.

18:21.768 --> 18:22.968
My pleasure.

18:36.050 --> 18:38.276
None may touch me!

18:39.864 --> 18:41.064
Yaaahhhhhh!

18:41.150 --> 18:42.314
[electricity sizzles]

18:45.286 --> 18:46.246
Touch.

18:48.091 --> 18:49.724
Ugh. Hiyahh!

18:51.161 --> 18:52.121
Guhh!

18:52.217 --> 18:52.865
Oof.

18:56.407 --> 18:59.089
JARVIS. Activate the dampening field now!

19:05.037 --> 19:07.852
Huh? No. No!

19:08.278 --> 19:09.838
What have you done?

19:10.155 --> 19:11.715
I turned off your magic.

19:11.768 --> 19:13.092
Just come along quietly.

19:13.122 --> 19:15.059
I don't want to have to hurt you.

19:15.268 --> 19:16.432
I do.

19:16.874 --> 19:19.879
Dynamo! Wonder Man!
Destroy the Avengers!

19:22.208 --> 19:23.765
No! Wa-- Auuugh!

19:23.828 --> 19:24.779
Stark!

19:25.116 --> 19:29.418
[machine gun fire]

19:29.924 --> 19:32.331
Rarrhh! Arrrggh!

19:45.093 --> 19:46.908
Goodbye, Amora!

19:47.310 --> 19:48.503
Enough, Zemo!

19:48.617 --> 19:50.774
I'm not going to stand
by and watch anymore.

19:50.810 --> 19:54.165
I'm not going to let you hurt
anyone else because I'm afraid.

19:57.488 --> 19:59.000
[gunfire] Auugh.

20:08.002 --> 20:08.962
Ugh.

20:17.152 --> 20:18.634
No. Stop her!

20:22.100 --> 20:23.060
No!

20:27.960 --> 20:29.814
Yaaaaahhhhhh!!!

20:38.514 --> 20:39.608
[gasps]

20:39.888 --> 20:40.848
You!

20:41.692 --> 20:44.811
<i>You would have let the
Enchantress destroy me.</i>

20:46.396 --> 20:49.406
You have changed, Captain.

20:49.961 --> 20:52.889
You have no idea who I am.

20:53.255 --> 20:54.161
Hi-yah!

20:55.331 --> 20:58.331
<i>[Iron Man] As horrible as that went,
we didn't do too bad.</i>

20:58.982 --> 21:01.382
We got Zemo, Abomination and Dynamo.

21:01.696 --> 21:03.234
Executioner's locked up too.

21:03.265 --> 21:05.624
The Masters of Evil are pretty much done.

21:06.102 --> 21:08.297
And we're alive. There's that.

21:08.852 --> 21:10.790
Because of Wonder Man.

21:10.846 --> 21:12.090
With the Norn Store's power,

21:12.223 --> 21:15.292
the Enchantress may very
well have been unstoppable.

21:15.984 --> 21:18.988
Wonder Man's sacrifice saved us all.

21:19.460 --> 21:21.464
Do you think she's gone for good?

21:30.188 --> 21:32.200
Yeah. Me neither.

21:37.568 --> 21:38.851
[gasps]

21:40.762 --> 21:44.043
<i>[deep voice] Amora the Enchantress.</i>

21:44.501 --> 21:45.461
Surtur.

21:46.297 --> 21:49.634
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

21:51.486 --> 21:53.992
<i>You serve me now.</i>

21:54.964 --> 21:58.227
