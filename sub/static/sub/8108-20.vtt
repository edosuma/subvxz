CHARLOTTE: Bye.

00:28.738 --> 00:32.409
I want to be
alone with my wife.

00:46.756 --> 00:48.591
I'm a selfish SOB.

00:50.635 --> 00:53.888
I never got you to Rio.

00:54.723 --> 00:56.433
There was always

00:57.392 --> 01:00.145
one more problem
at the stores.

01:00.770 --> 01:02.856
You deserved
better than that.

01:04.357 --> 01:05.900
I love you.

01:07.777 --> 01:09.654
I always have.

01:14.868 --> 01:16.119
I'm ready.

help her.

01:59.954 --> 02:01.164
Help her!

02:33.947 --> 02:36.157
Fifty-four-year-old woman with acute
respiratory failure.

02:36.282 --> 02:39.702
No anaphylaxis, lung issues
or tracheal lesions.

02:39.994 --> 02:41.871
Tox screen was clean for coke
and amphetamines.

02:41.996 --> 02:46.543
I will give you 30 reasons, one for each
pound that caused the apnea,

02:46.668 --> 02:48.753
which inflamed
the epiglottis.

02:48.878 --> 02:52.173
Why's our rainbow coalition
missing Brown and Bi?

02:52.298 --> 02:54.759
Thirteen's with the patient,
and Kutner's dog's sick.

02:54.884 --> 02:55.885
He should be in
by lunch.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.847
No apnea because no sleeping problems
when she's sleeping.

02:58.972 --> 03:00.181
She's spent
the last six months

03:00.306 --> 03:02.392
caring for her husband who's dying
of heart failure.

03:02.517 --> 03:04.686
Reason 31, whatever whacked
the husband's heart

03:04.811 --> 03:06.729
is also
whacking her airway.

03:06.855 --> 03:10.024
And, oh, good, I thought maybe Kutner
was home nursing the rib you broke

03:10.149 --> 03:13.069
when you elbowed your way
in for credit on the last patient.

03:13.778 --> 03:16.948
I contributed. And the patient's illness
wasn't caused by her husband,

03:17.073 --> 03:18.658
unless lung cancer
is contagious.

03:18.783 --> 03:20.034
Interesting.

03:20.159 --> 03:22.412
Not about the patient,
that was kind of dull.

03:22.537 --> 03:25.582
I thought maybe you were lying
to cover for Kutner, which sounds noble,

03:25.707 --> 03:28.918
except you're doing it
out of guilt, instead of love.

03:29.043 --> 03:31.671
She visited her sister
in Hawaii about six months ago,

03:31.796 --> 03:32.797
just before
her husband got sick.

03:32.922 --> 03:35.717
Could've picked up
melioidosis from one of the islands.

03:35.842 --> 03:37.218
Would have jumped
to the husband,

03:37.343 --> 03:39.888
finished off him
and his lame immune system.

03:40.013 --> 03:42.140
TAUB: No tumors,
no drugs, no bacteria...

03:42.265 --> 03:44.225
Leaves viral.
Varicella zoster.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.311
Start her on IV fluids
and acyclovir.

03:46.436 --> 03:48.146
Can't. She's demanding
to be released

03:48.271 --> 03:49.606
so she can get
home to her husband.

03:49.731 --> 03:51.941
How sweet.
They can die together,

03:52.066 --> 03:53.985
instead of separately,
40 years apart.

03:54.110 --> 03:57.530
She claims he got stronger
as soon as she stopped breathing.

03:57.655 --> 03:58.823
The mind
can heal the body.

03:58.948 --> 04:02.327
Seeing his wife in distress might have
actually slowed down his death.

04:02.452 --> 04:04.329
Or he just had
an adrenaline surge

04:04.454 --> 04:06.706
when he saw his chance
to hit the singles market.

04:06.831 --> 04:08.583
- Send her home.
- We don't need to.

04:09.584 --> 04:12.378
I had an idea,
all by myself.

04:19.552 --> 04:20.470
CHARLOTTE: Eddie?

04:20.595 --> 04:22.388
Found him loitering
in the lobby.

04:22.764 --> 04:24.098
You're still with me.

04:24.223 --> 04:25.892
Where the hell else
am I gonna go?

04:26.017 --> 04:28.269
TAUB: And now,
with your permission,

04:28.394 --> 04:30.438
we'd like to try
to make you better.

04:37.695 --> 04:40.657
KATHERINE: The pageant starts in
an hour. You have to do something.

04:40.782 --> 04:42.241
There's something wrong
inside her head.

04:42.367 --> 04:44.953
It's like she has no idea
what's going on around her.

04:45.578 --> 04:47.705
I thought she was just
flirting with me.

04:49.082 --> 04:52.794
I could fix it,
but it's gonna cost you $3.75.

04:54.087 --> 04:56.297
Well, I'm not
just gonna give you my coffee.

04:57.590 --> 05:00.593
Think of it
as Costa Rican sober juice.

05:02.679 --> 05:03.805
She's drunk?

05:03.930 --> 05:07.600
That little minty scent
hiding beneath the rose petal perfume,

05:07.725 --> 05:09.560
and the cherry blossom
moisturizer,

05:09.686 --> 05:11.688
and the morning dew
hairspray...

05:12.647 --> 05:14.607
You sneak into
Mommy's bathroom

05:14.732 --> 05:16.192
and gulp some
of her mouthwash?

05:16.651 --> 05:18.277
Gotta be perfect.

05:18.778 --> 05:20.196
You spit it out?

05:20.321 --> 05:21.656
Mommy doesn't.

05:24.701 --> 05:25.868
Treatment worked.

05:25.994 --> 05:28.121
Charlotte's breathing's back to normal.
She's being discharged.

05:28.246 --> 05:31.040
She can resume her vigil over her
husband. He's started fading again.

05:31.165 --> 05:32.750
Win some, lose some.

05:32.875 --> 05:36.421
And, strictly speaking,
since he's not my patient, win some.

05:36.546 --> 05:37.964
Oh, look at the time.

05:38.089 --> 05:40.800
It's half past Taub
was lying about Kutner.

05:40.925 --> 05:43.219
He probably went to
a comic book fest,

05:43.344 --> 05:45.471
spent the night at some
Wonder Woman's lair. I'm sure he'll...

05:45.596 --> 05:47.765
Find out what,
or who, he's doing.

05:47.890 --> 05:50.643
Either way, Cuddy's gonna want me to
write it under "Reason for Termination."

05:50.768 --> 05:51.978

she's in pain.

06:03.948 --> 06:06.576
Pulse is rapid and regular,
no fluid in her lungs.

06:06.701 --> 06:07.744

I don't know.

(KNOCKING)

06:12.540 --> 06:15.752

It's Foreman and 13.

06:17.837 --> 06:19.047
Where are you going?

06:19.172 --> 06:21.174
House didn't ask us
to find out where he wasn't.

06:21.299 --> 06:23.551
If you wanna climb
a fifth-floor fire escape...

06:23.676 --> 06:25.011

This might be faster.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.850
Kutner!

06:32.602 --> 06:34.062
Man-boy heaven.

06:35.146 --> 06:36.689
Surprised
he ever leaves.

06:43.863 --> 06:47.158
There's nothing on his calendar.
His pager's still here.

Eric.

07:38.668 --> 07:40.378
(SIRENS APPROACHING)

08:11.159 --> 08:14.162
He didn't say anything
to any of you?

08:16.080 --> 08:20.168
Family problems? Bad relationship?
Financial pressures?

08:20.293 --> 08:23.171
His parents were shot
right in front of him.

08:23.462 --> 08:25.047
Parents are
ancient history.

08:25.173 --> 08:27.383
Not to someone
who actually cares.

08:28.301 --> 08:33.472
He didn't slit his wrists and peacefully
drift away, he shot himself.

08:35.308 --> 08:38.227
He didn't leave a note,
that means panic.

08:38.853 --> 08:41.689
Which could've been pre-empted if
the idiots who worked alongside him

08:41.814 --> 08:43.608
for 80 hours a week
had seen this coming.

08:43.733 --> 08:45.109
You're blaming us?

08:46.402 --> 08:47.778
I'm just trying
to figure it out.

08:47.904 --> 08:50.907
We would've helped him
if he'd reached out to us. He didn't.

08:51.574 --> 08:53.326
We should've
picked up on something.

08:53.451 --> 08:55.119
This isn't our fault.

08:55.286 --> 08:57.413
Something like 25%
of suicidal people

08:57.538 --> 08:59.415
show no outward signs
of depression.

08:59.540 --> 09:03.169
No, 25% of suicidal people
have friends

09:03.294 --> 09:05.296
who didn't notice anything
and don't want to feel guilty.

09:05.421 --> 09:09.050
Killing yourself
also kills all other options.

09:09.175 --> 09:11.469
Makes Kutner an idiot.

09:11.594 --> 09:14.430
So pity, yes,
but guilt, no.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.432
If that's what
you want to tell yourself.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.392
We still have a patient.

09:18.517 --> 09:22.563
Actually, two. One worsening,
one who should be worsening.

09:22.688 --> 09:25.358
You can't be in denial
about Kutner and the husband.

09:25.483 --> 09:28.444
It is possible Eddie's body
is willing itself to live.

09:28.569 --> 09:30.321
Well, call the tabloids.

09:30.446 --> 09:34.367
Tell them you just witnessed the miracle
of slightly increased kidney function.

09:35.576 --> 09:39.205
Maybe we should pass this file off
to another doctor.

09:39.330 --> 09:42.333
And the next one, too?
And the one after that?

09:44.418 --> 09:47.546
How many files till it's okay
that Kutner's dead?

09:51.217 --> 09:54.387
Cardiac enzymes means
she didn't have a heart attack.

09:54.512 --> 09:57.556
No vision problems means
no mitochondrial disease.

09:57.682 --> 09:59.850
Could be
a metabolic disorder. Acidosis.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.352
THIRTEEN:
Blood pH was normal.

10:01.477 --> 10:04.563
Polyserositis would inflame
the membranes near her epiglottis

10:04.689 --> 10:07.984
and the heart's pericardium,
causing the chest pain.

10:08.651 --> 10:09.944
I'm sorry.

10:11.279 --> 10:14.740
I've hired a grief counselor,
who I'm sure none of you will see.

10:14.865 --> 10:17.326
And I'm offering time off,
which I'm sure none of you will take.

10:17.451 --> 10:19.453
But just know
it's available.

10:24.166 --> 10:27.295
Polyserositis fits.
Start her on indomethacin.

10:32.258 --> 10:33.968
CUDDY: If you'd rather
not deal with this case...

10:34.093 --> 10:38.180
I'm fine, despite
what Wilson will say.

10:38.306 --> 10:39.557
He hasn't come to you?

10:39.682 --> 10:41.892
Pretty sure he has Mahjong
Tuesday mornings.

10:42.018 --> 10:44.395
I assume he thinks that I will work
through this better

10:44.520 --> 10:48.274
if I don't have to keep
flicking his wings off my shoulder.

10:51.319 --> 10:52.445
You didn't even
have an inkling?

10:52.570 --> 10:56.490
I know his fantasy football team
cratered, figured he'd gotten over it.

10:58.909 --> 11:00.161
Well...

11:04.957 --> 11:06.375
Sorry for your loss.

11:07.710 --> 11:10.171
Thanks.
It's not my loss.

11:10.796 --> 11:12.798
Then I'm sorry
you don't think it is.

11:21.932 --> 11:24.852
Patient's membranes
aren't going to heal themselves.

11:25.436 --> 11:27.146
Taub went
to run the treatment.

11:27.563 --> 11:30.399
We'd like to go
see Kutner's parents.

11:33.194 --> 11:34.487
I'll join you.

11:42.620 --> 11:46.290
Polyserositis damages the protective
covering around tissue and organs.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.542
The indomethacin is simply
an anti-inflammatory,

11:48.667 --> 11:49.960
but it should fix it.

11:50.086 --> 11:51.962
Just make
the pain stop.

11:54.173 --> 11:55.466
Charlotte.

11:57.593 --> 11:58.761
Close your eyes.

12:00.805 --> 12:02.098
Now.

12:03.724 --> 12:07.812
Pretend you finally
made it down to Rio.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.606
You're on the balcony of

12:11.482 --> 12:12.650
(CHUCKLES)

12:13.484 --> 12:15.694
some fancy hotel.

12:17.488 --> 12:19.407
You never talk like this.

12:19.532 --> 12:23.160
Yeah, just shut up
and let me do this.

12:23.285 --> 12:26.872
And you're on that balcony,
and you are watching the Mardi Gras.

12:27.081 --> 12:29.083
It's called Carnival.

12:31.252 --> 12:33.712
And I don't want
to go without you.

12:35.464 --> 12:36.632
I want you to.

12:38.384 --> 12:41.679
And I want it to be everything
you've ever dreamed of.

12:43.055 --> 12:47.226
Sorry to interrupt,
but I'd like to run one more test.

12:48.102 --> 12:49.478
On you.

12:53.357 --> 12:56.527
JULIA: This is the
first day we got him. He was six.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.697
Sweetest little boy
you ever met.

13:01.157 --> 13:02.741
FOREMAN:
Must have been scary,

13:03.701 --> 13:07.037
going through a trauma, and then
being handed off to a new family.

13:07.329 --> 13:10.541
We kept telling him
to call us Richard and Julia,

13:10.875 --> 13:12.877
but it was always
Mr. and Mrs. Kutner.

13:14.170 --> 13:17.631
Then, on his ninth birthday,
we gave him a chemistry set.

13:18.716 --> 13:21.051
(CHUCKLES) Lawrence always loved
blowing things up.

13:22.636 --> 13:26.599
And he said, "Thanks, Mom.
Thanks, Dad."

13:27.808 --> 13:29.602
That's who we were
from then on.

13:32.980 --> 13:36.192
He was pretty special.
We were lucky to have him.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.571
You spent the most time
with him.

13:41.489 --> 13:44.241
He spoke so highly
of all of you.

13:45.576 --> 13:47.161
Do you have any idea...

13:48.454 --> 13:49.830
I wish we did.

13:50.873 --> 13:51.707
We all...

13:51.832 --> 13:53.626
HOUSE: It was his name.

13:54.627 --> 13:58.172
He was conflicted.
Didn't know where he fit in.

13:59.006 --> 14:02.343
Being ripped out of his world
and stuck into yours.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.095
We encouraged him
to hold on to his heritage.

14:05.221 --> 14:07.681
HOUSE: It's hard
to still be Lawrence Choudhary

14:07.848 --> 14:09.808
when everyone sees you
as Lawrence Kutner.

14:09.934 --> 14:12.394
It was his idea
to take our name.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.355
- You should have said no.
- House.

14:14.480 --> 14:17.775
All his Anglo name gave him was the
illusion that he was someone he wasn't.

14:17.900 --> 14:20.110
You were being emotional,
not rational.

14:20.444 --> 14:21.612
You didn't understand him.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.198
We loved that boy,
you son of a bitch.

14:24.323 --> 14:27.201
You wanted to make him happy
by shutting out his pain.

14:27.326 --> 14:30.246
When he looked happy, you assumed
the pain had gone,

14:30.371 --> 14:32.581
but it just
got buried deeper,

14:32.998 --> 14:36.293
leaving him tormented about who he was,
until finally he put a bullet...

14:36.418 --> 14:37.378
House.

14:39.129 --> 14:40.798
Go back
to the hospital.

15:02.319 --> 15:03.821
I'm sorry
about your son.

15:16.458 --> 15:20.504
Indomethacin had no effect, she's still
in pain. Rules out polyserositis.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.131
I ran a hormone panel
on Eddie.

15:22.256 --> 15:23.882
His prolactin's
above normal.

15:24.008 --> 15:25.593
Means
he's actually improving.

15:27.303 --> 15:29.805
Body chemistry changes
for all sorts of reasons.

15:29.930 --> 15:31.640
Stress, fear,
why not love?

15:31.765 --> 15:34.643
Maybe he's going into
some sort of remission.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.896
You haven't asked if I learned anything
relevant from the Kutners.

15:38.063 --> 15:39.815
If you had, I'm sure
you'd have mentioned it.

15:39.940 --> 15:42.610
Or you're just afraid
there is something relevant,

15:42.735 --> 15:45.029
which would mean
you could have saved him.

15:45.154 --> 15:47.281
I don't buy that suicide
is always a cry for help.

15:47.406 --> 15:49.491
Sometimes you just
don't want help.

15:51.243 --> 15:52.536
Good thing
you got some,

15:54.622 --> 15:57.291
or you'd have tried again
and gotten it right.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.086
She doesn't have
Wegener's.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.006
Kidney function's normal.

16:04.131 --> 16:07.134
It's not byssinosis,
it's not mitral valve stenosis.

16:07.259 --> 16:08.719
Nothing fits.

16:09.595 --> 16:12.139
If it doesn't fit
any diagnosis,

16:12.264 --> 16:14.433
that just leaves
one diagnosis.

16:20.230 --> 16:21.523
I'm Dr. House.

16:21.649 --> 16:24.193
You have hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy.

16:24.318 --> 16:26.111
His heart is too weak,
yours is too strong.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.613
Good news is
it's fixable.

16:27.738 --> 16:30.574
We induce a massive heart attack
and kill off the extra muscle.

16:30.699 --> 16:32.284
You want to give me
a heart attack?

16:32.409 --> 16:34.536
It's only dangerous if your heart
is normal-sized.

16:34.662 --> 16:36.538
- But since all the...
- Are you serious?

16:37.581 --> 16:38.791
No.

16:39.583 --> 16:42.169
This is actually very annoying,
and I'm getting really bored

16:42.294 --> 16:43.962
of lying to patients
to scare them

16:44.088 --> 16:46.340
into telling me the truth.
She's faking.

16:46.799 --> 16:48.425
And, yes,
if she keeps faking,

16:48.550 --> 16:50.761
I'm going to eventually do something
that will kill her.

16:50.886 --> 16:54.098
How could she be...
The windpipe thing?

16:54.223 --> 16:56.266
That was real.
The treatment made her better.

16:56.392 --> 16:58.268
But good for her was bad for you,
which was bad for her,

16:58.394 --> 17:00.562
so she made herself bad.
It's all so simple.

17:00.688 --> 17:04.483
She figured that the sicker she was,
the longer you'd hang on.

17:06.235 --> 17:07.444

17:13.158 --> 17:15.285
We haven't been
this close for years.

17:15.411 --> 17:17.454

hang on to that.

plain swear, because...

Mr. and Mrs. Kutner.

17:49.445 --> 17:51.530
They caused Kutner's death,
why not Charlotte's?

17:51.655 --> 17:55.451
Mourning period's over.
Foreman's sense of irony is back.

17:55.576 --> 17:57.661
I was wrong
about the ethnic reason.

through his rolodex

18:10.466 --> 18:11.717

with an answer?

18:11.842 --> 18:15.262
I've been polite to the friends I've
called, all of whom were useless.

18:15.387 --> 18:18.223
They weren't useless, they just didn't
know anything more than we did.

Tomato, tomato.

to do behind my back

his heart's improving.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.245
Did you let me
hire a pervert?

18:40.370 --> 18:42.331
Well, it'd be hypocritical
of me not to.

18:42.456 --> 18:45.501
Kutner's police background check
from when he started.

18:45.626 --> 18:47.586
He was charged with
indecent exposure.

18:47.711 --> 18:50.255
Kutner streaked at the Penn-Dartmouth
football game.

18:50.380 --> 18:53.425
Precisely the kind of thing
you'd expect him to do.

18:53.550 --> 18:54.968
It's okay.

18:55.719 --> 18:57.054
You should be upset.

18:57.179 --> 18:59.890
He thought like you,
pushed boundaries like you.

19:00.015 --> 19:01.809
If he thought like me,

19:01.934 --> 19:03.602
he'd have known that
living in misery

19:03.727 --> 19:06.146

than dying in it.

39:45.217 --> 39:47.803
Off to one side

39:48.304 --> 39:52.183
It is a personal thing

39:52.475 --> 39:56.395
Where?
When I can't stand

39:56.771 --> 40:02.526
Up in this cage
I'm not regretting

40:04.111 --> 40:09.283
I don't need a better thing

40:10.701 --> 40:13.788
I'll settle for less

40:15.748 --> 40:20.669
<i>It's another thing for me</i>

40:21.504 --> 40:25.257
I just have to wander

40:25.466 --> 40:30.805
Through this world alone

40:32.556 --> 40:34.016
(INAUDIBLE)

40:53.160 --> 40:56.872
Stop before you fall

40:57.581 --> 41:02.962
Into the hole
that I have dug here

41:04.880 --> 41:08.467
Rest even as you

41:08.926 --> 41:15.057
Are starting to feel
the way I used to

41:16.392 --> 41:21.564
I don't need a better thing

41:22.064 --> 41:26.235
Just to sound confused

41:28.654 --> 41:33.033
Don't talk about everyone

41:33.742 --> 41:40.708
I am not amused by you

41:43.419 --> 41:47.006
'Cause I'm gonna lose you

41:49.175 --> 41:52.595
Yes, I'm gonna lose you

41:54.889 --> 41:58.225
If I'm gonna lose you

42:06.692 --> 42:10.070
'Cause I'm gonna lose you

42:12.364 --> 42:15.784
Yes, I'm gonna lose you

42:18.078 --> 42:21.790
If I'm gonna lose you

42:25.127 --> 42:29.506
I'll lose you now for good
