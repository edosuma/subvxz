WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.037
Hey, there you are.

00:03.104 --> 00:04.638
Since it's your
retirement party tonight,

00:04.705 --> 00:06.540
if the leaves
in the front yard
got raked up today,

00:06.607 --> 00:07.608
that'd be great.

00:07.675 --> 00:10.244
Oh, that'd be
unbelievable.

00:10.311 --> 00:12.713
What happened to,
"I got you"?

00:12.780 --> 00:14.948
I mean, you're home now.
You have nothing
but free time.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.285
But that's the misconception
about retired people.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.220
Some of us are very active,
like me.

00:19.287 --> 00:21.522
I got the guys coming over
at 11:00 for a little
day drinking.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.958
Then we're all gonna learn
how to use crossbows.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.128
-Hey, Dad?
-Yeah.

00:27.195 --> 00:28.929
I probably shouldn't go
to school today.

00:28.996 --> 00:33.033
I-I think I got a concussion
from football.

00:33.101 --> 00:36.704
Jack, you play
"Madden" football.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.073
Yeah, but yesterday
I got excited,

00:39.140 --> 00:41.309
and I hit myself in the face
with the controller.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.145
I'm still not right.

00:45.313 --> 00:47.381
He's got to be a huge letdown
after me, right?

00:47.448 --> 00:49.483
I got to be honest.
Neither of you knocked
it out of the park.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.753
Okay, I think what your father
means is we love you both.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.222
Now, backpacks are packed.
Let's go.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.389
-Have a great day.
-Bye.

00:55.456 --> 00:57.057
Love you. Goodbye.
Be good, okay?

00:57.125 --> 00:58.859
Oh, I got you
a little retirement gift.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.861
I mean, if you have time
in your schedule.

01:00.928 --> 01:02.163
I will move
some things around.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.298
Let me see.
What do you got?

01:04.365 --> 01:08.202
To a great cop,
for a job well done.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.470
It's a Gyro Bowl.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.172
Oh, I know what it is,
Donna.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.840
( Laughs )

01:12.906 --> 01:15.343
It's the bowl
that won't spill.
How did you know I wanted it?

01:15.409 --> 01:16.577
Every time
the commercial came on,

01:16.644 --> 01:18.045
you kicked out your legs
and you screamed.

01:18.112 --> 01:19.647
Yeah, and it worked
because now I have one.

01:19.713 --> 01:22.150
All right.
Let's test this baby out.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.685
We got to start small.
Let's try some pretzels, okay?

01:24.752 --> 01:27.821
And I was worried that when
you retired, we'd be bored.
Okay.

01:27.888 --> 01:30.358
Now, give me a scenario
where I might spill it.
Come on.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.693
Okay, you're on
a fishing boat, having
a snack. Oh.

01:32.760 --> 01:33.961
-I like that.
-Yeah.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.496
Oh, look --
look at that.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.097
Look at that. Oh.

01:37.165 --> 01:39.433
-But the water's choppy.
-Oh, is it choppy?

01:39.500 --> 01:41.001
No, it's choppier
than that.
Oh.

01:41.068 --> 01:42.803
Yeah, ooh, ooh.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.938
And then -- And then
a huge wave smashes into you!

01:45.005 --> 01:47.040
-Oh!
-Oh, nothing!

01:47.107 --> 01:48.709
Nothing!

01:48.776 --> 01:50.278
All right, I want to do it.
It's my turn.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.380
Okay, uh, we got to kick it
up a notch, though.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.415
Let's go with, uh...
We're going with ketchup.

01:54.482 --> 01:55.949
Okay.
All right, great.

01:56.016 --> 01:57.418
-All right.
-Ready?

01:57.485 --> 01:59.220
Oh, see, this is why
I love you. You have no fear.

01:59.287 --> 02:00.288
Yep.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.156
Okay, good.
All right.

02:02.223 --> 02:03.357
Now,
you give me a scenario.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.259
Okay, now,
you are a prostitute.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.528
You --

02:07.595 --> 02:08.662
Wow, I'm sorry.

02:08.729 --> 02:09.963
I don't even know
where that came from.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.432
I don't even --

02:11.499 --> 02:13.133
Wow is right.
Oh, and you know what?

02:13.201 --> 02:15.503
How about I am a school nurse
who's about to be late?

02:15.569 --> 02:16.904
You're not a prostitute.
You're a princess.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.606
Yeah, no, no,
you're a good princess.

02:18.672 --> 02:20.874
Seriously, no,
you're a princess
who donates to charity,

02:20.941 --> 02:23.110
and you started
your own foundation.

02:23.177 --> 02:24.445
I got to go.

02:24.512 --> 02:26.146
-Oh.
-I love you. Bye.

02:26.214 --> 02:30.718
* I am not your ordinary guy

02:33.287 --> 02:35.523
20 years ago,
four bright-eyed dreamers

02:35.589 --> 02:38.226
embarked on a journey
to keep this county safe.

02:38.292 --> 02:40.894
A boatload of murders
and 5,000 armed
robberies later,

02:40.961 --> 02:42.730
here we are
no worse for the wear.

02:42.796 --> 02:43.997
Hey!
( Laughter )

02:44.064 --> 02:45.799
Happy retirement, boys!

02:45.866 --> 02:48.068
Yeah!
Now, it's our time.

02:48.135 --> 02:50.671
-Yeah, baby!
-Whoo!

02:50.738 --> 02:53.907
All right, now,
last week during bowling,

02:53.974 --> 02:56.043
we talked about
a cross-country
motorcycle trip,

02:56.109 --> 02:58.412
but we were a few beers in
when we discussed it.

02:58.479 --> 03:01.815
Yeah. When I woke up,
I totally forgot.

03:01.882 --> 03:05.118
I got seven kids.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.288
I can't swing
that chunk of time.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.089
Mott, these kids
are gonna be problem.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.392
I can feel it already.
All right.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.160
Let's put the bike trip
on hold, all right?

03:13.227 --> 03:14.795
Now, Thursday,
we got our go-kart race,

03:14.862 --> 03:17.465
and on Friday,
we got shooting paintballs.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.799
But you know what?

03:18.866 --> 03:20.334
If we want to kick this
retirement off with a bang,

03:20.401 --> 03:21.569
I say we combine them.

03:21.635 --> 03:24.805
We call it, like,
"paint-kart" or "go-balls."

03:24.872 --> 03:27.708
Yeah, I'm not down
with go-balls.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.144
But remember,
it's 50 bucks a man,

03:31.211 --> 03:32.913
and cash, Mott, okay?

03:32.980 --> 03:34.448
No leftover gift cards
from The Container Store.

03:34.515 --> 03:35.716
We get it --
your sister works there.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.685
What's up, boys?

03:37.751 --> 03:38.919
-Oh.
-Whoa.

03:38.986 --> 03:39.987
Don't mind me.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.355
Just an active-duty
firefighter

03:41.422 --> 03:42.790
bringing a little chili
for the party tonight.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.825
Kyle, to call yourself
a firefighter,

03:44.892 --> 03:47.027
don't you actually
have to fight a fire?

03:47.094 --> 03:48.462
-( Laughs )
-Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:48.529 --> 03:49.697
Come on, Goody.
Leave my brother alone.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.265
No, no, I got this.

03:51.332 --> 03:54.668
For your information,
I could go on calls.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.138
But, you know,
the guys like my cooking.

03:58.205 --> 04:00.974
I can't help it if I know
my way around a spice rack.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.712
All right, guys, can we
focus, please? Go-karts.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.547
Actually,
I can't do go-karts Thursday.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.516
I got to drive my wife
to the orthodontist

04:08.582 --> 04:09.817
to get her braces
put on.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.752
Come on.
You got to be kidding me.

04:11.819 --> 04:15.456
She's got a smile
like a busted picket fence.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.391
What -- Come on, guys!

04:17.458 --> 04:19.460
You with your kids,
your wife with her teeth.

04:19.527 --> 04:22.730
Get your priorities straight!

04:22.796 --> 04:25.032
I'm not doing this for me.
I'm doing it for all of us.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.334
And by the way,

04:26.400 --> 04:28.436
not one thank you for the
PowerPoint presentation.

04:28.502 --> 04:29.770
I enjoyed it.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.905
Nah, it's too late.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.374
-Oh, man.
-What?

04:33.441 --> 04:35.309
Alvarez
from the fourth precinct.

04:35.376 --> 04:38.612
His wife just gave him
the boot, and he needs
a place to stay.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.213
Well, how about you, Duff?
You're single.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.315
Oh, I can't.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.750
I got my parents
staying with me.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.084
You mean at their house?

04:44.151 --> 04:45.886
( Laughter )

04:45.953 --> 04:47.120
Yeah.
What about you?

04:47.187 --> 04:49.089
You have the garage to rent.
Put him in there.

04:49.156 --> 04:50.524
I'd love to help
a fellow cop out.

04:50.591 --> 04:52.426
It's just that Donna wants
an old lady in there.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.827
She thinks
they're more reliable.

04:53.894 --> 04:56.029
But Alvarez's father
owns Frank and Steins,

04:56.096 --> 04:57.598
that hot dog
and beer place.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.533
I know they'd sponsor
the softball team

04:59.600 --> 05:01.234
we've been trying
to start.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.271
And then after the games,
we're looking at free beer.

05:05.573 --> 05:06.807
All right, I'll figure out

05:06.874 --> 05:08.842
how to get Donna on board
with Alvarez.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.210
Yeah,
and let's be honest.

05:10.277 --> 05:11.812
I mean, most of the stuff
we're doing for retirement

05:11.879 --> 05:13.347
is just okay.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.416
The beer
is what makes it great.

05:18.586 --> 05:21.755
Thank you so much.
We'll be in touch very soon.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.957
( Gasps )
Oh, my God.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.226
And she knits,
which is, like,
basically quilting.

05:26.293 --> 05:28.195
How great is she?

05:28.261 --> 05:29.797
Pbht!

05:30.998 --> 05:32.966
What?

05:33.033 --> 05:35.369
No, you've turned down
everyone. What's with you?

05:35.436 --> 05:36.937
She would be
the perfect tenant.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.972
Okay, first off,
she's addicted to heroin.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.409
You saw the track marks.

05:41.475 --> 05:44.878
Track marks.
Those were varicose veins.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.414
Oh.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.616
Please.
Grandma's riding the dragon.

05:49.817 --> 05:51.919
Kendra:
Everybody, I'm home!

05:51.985 --> 05:54.488
-Kendra?
-Yeah. Hey.

05:54.555 --> 05:56.457
-Hi, honey.
-Hi.

05:56.524 --> 05:57.558
Oh.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.159
There's my baby girl.
Look at this.

05:59.226 --> 06:00.894
I thought
you had midterms.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.896
What? I wouldn't miss
your retirement party.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.699
Now, what would make you
happier than anything else
in the world?

06:05.766 --> 06:07.501
Okay, I'm gonna stop you
right there.

06:07.568 --> 06:10.203
All-American burger.

06:10.270 --> 06:11.872
Well, I'm gonna stop you
right there.

06:11.939 --> 06:12.940
Backpack.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.008
Oh! Mama!

06:15.075 --> 06:17.411
Now, if there was
a strawberry shake...

06:17.478 --> 06:18.646
Hood.
Oh!

06:18.712 --> 06:21.482
See...

06:21.549 --> 06:23.684
that is why
she's my favorite.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.486
Hey, grab plates.
There's burgers in
there for all of us.

06:25.553 --> 06:28.656
Huh? Actually,
there's only four.

06:30.057 --> 06:32.192
All right, fine,
you guys can split one. Okay.

06:32.259 --> 06:34.428
You didn't tell him,
did you?

06:34.495 --> 06:36.697
About your boyfriend?
No, you told me not to.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.766
Okay, good.
I'm ready to tell him myself.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.167
Oh, great.
Okay, but not tonight.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.735
Tonight is
your dad's retirement party.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.437
All right, we got to think of
a good time.

06:43.504 --> 06:45.105
Um, ooh, Sunday,
right after church.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.940
Yeah, there's a
one-hour window in there

06:47.007 --> 06:49.510
when he's trying to be
a better person.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.679
He's coming tonight
with his roommate.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.746
What? No!

06:52.813 --> 06:53.847
No.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.449
Honey, I haven't laid
the groundwork.

06:55.516 --> 06:57.451
Okay, you know what?
Fine.

06:57.518 --> 06:58.752
Just introduce him
tonight.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.320
Let him make
a good impression,

07:00.387 --> 07:02.690
and then I'll hit
your dad with
the boyfriend thing later.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.091
Hey, guys, quick update --

07:04.157 --> 07:07.394
uh, I'm already
two burgers in, and...

07:07.461 --> 07:09.797
there's really no sign
of me slowing down.

07:09.863 --> 07:13.033
So I think we're gonna have to
rethink the burger fractions.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.002
Well, you know, we don't have
time to eat, anyway.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.436
We have to interview
more tenants.

07:16.504 --> 07:19.006
Oh, thank God,
'cause I ate all of them.

07:19.072 --> 07:21.642
**

07:21.709 --> 07:23.176
So, Mr. Alvarez,
I got to tell you,

07:23.243 --> 07:25.212
we're not just taking anybody
for this apartment.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.482
But...my gut tells me
you're all right.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.786
Oh, I see you're a cop.
Hmm, small world.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.021
You guys ever meet?

07:34.087 --> 07:36.023
I want to say no.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.326
We met.
Couple times.

07:39.392 --> 07:42.329
I also
want to say yes.

07:42.395 --> 07:45.332
Listen, I just really
appreciate you guys
considering me.

07:45.398 --> 07:46.867
My wife kicked me out.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.201
Oh, I'm so sorry.

07:48.268 --> 07:51.338
No, no, my shrink says
I got to own my part in this.

07:51.404 --> 07:53.373
( Inhales sharply )

07:53.440 --> 07:56.143
I've been battling a pretty
good-size drinking problem.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.781
Blackouts, mouthwash,
the whole nine.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.355
It says here
your middle name's Carl.

08:08.421 --> 08:09.590
That's pretty cool.

08:11.358 --> 08:14.061
I'm sorry.
Did you say drinking problem?

08:14.127 --> 08:17.464
Yeah. And it doesn't help
that my dad owns a beer joint.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.132
Uh-huh.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.969
But by the grace of God,
I am sober now.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.805
18 days.

08:24.872 --> 08:27.575
Uh, can you give us a sec?

08:27.641 --> 08:28.676
-Honey?
-Yeah.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.310
-Okay.
-Sure.

08:35.048 --> 08:38.919
Please tell me this was not
just a setup to get free beer.

08:40.487 --> 08:42.155
Okay, that's how it started,
all right?

08:42.222 --> 08:44.491
But I didn't realize he had
this many issues. All right?

08:44.558 --> 08:46.627
And I'd be lying if I said
the free beer thing wasn't,
like, calling my name.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.461
It's like, uh...

08:48.528 --> 08:49.997
No.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.131
It's right there.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.233
No. I'm calling back
that other old lady.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.435
You know, the one you labeled
a gangbanger.

08:55.502 --> 08:58.706
Look, I know it sounds crazy,
but I want to help this guy.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.207
I mean, he's a good cop.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.743
He's drinking mouthwash.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.578
Was drinking mouthwash,
okay?

09:04.645 --> 09:07.014
You know how small
the cups are, really,
when you pop them...

09:07.080 --> 09:09.116
Okay, stop.
Stop.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.384
I've been going through
your retirement budget,

09:11.451 --> 09:13.587
and, honey, you're spending
money left and right.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.355
You're building
a go-kart.

09:15.422 --> 09:18.558
And did you really buy
a fast pass for
the water park?

09:18.626 --> 09:22.763
Yeah, I'm retired.
I'm not waiting in lines.

09:22.830 --> 09:23.897
Fine.

09:23.964 --> 09:25.065
If this guys flakes,

09:25.132 --> 09:27.200
you're gonna have to get
a side job.

09:27.267 --> 09:30.403
Okay, I'll -- I'll be
home here, all right?

09:30.470 --> 09:33.540
I'll watch.
And -- Please, cops help cops.

09:33.607 --> 09:34.942
( Sighs )

09:35.008 --> 09:36.143
Fine. Okay?

09:36.209 --> 09:38.245
I'll let you have this one --
on probation.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.280
But the first slipup,
and this guy's out. Agreed?

09:40.347 --> 09:42.115
Agreed. All right,
but let's be clear.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.818
Is drinking a slipup
or a pre-existing condi--

09:44.885 --> 09:46.286
Okay, it's a slipup.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.722
**

09:48.789 --> 09:50.824
Look, I had a little cake
made up for you.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.693
Aww. Ohh.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.196
Is that a dead body?

09:56.263 --> 09:58.031
That's not just
any dead body.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.133
This is your husband's
first homicide scene.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.835
Oh.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.671
Well,
his little head fell off.

10:03.737 --> 10:06.406
No, no, no, no.
That's where it ended up.

10:06.473 --> 10:07.675
Uh, hey, Dad.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.542
I hope you don't mind,

10:09.609 --> 10:11.444
but I invited some friends
from school.

10:11.511 --> 10:12.680
-Hey, I'm Todd.
-Oh.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.915
Congratulations on
your retirement, Mr. Gable.

10:14.982 --> 10:17.617
Yes, congratulations.
I'm Chale.

10:20.253 --> 10:22.790
You know, I have a lot of cops
in my family,

10:22.856 --> 10:24.357
so much respect, sir.

10:24.424 --> 10:27.194
Well, Thanks, Todd.
So, are you boys
pre-law with Kendra?

10:27.260 --> 10:29.629
I --
I am,
but I also play baseball.

10:29.697 --> 10:30.931
I mean, it's crazy,

10:30.998 --> 10:32.766
but the Mets and the Cubs
are looking at me, so...

10:32.833 --> 10:34.067
-Really?
-Yeah.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.737
And, uh, Chale got his degree
in computer science.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.872
He's working on
this amazing app.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.608
I still don't have
the exact idea yet.

10:41.675 --> 10:45.545
I'm circling it,
but it is going to be massive.

10:45.612 --> 10:47.480
You may be coming to
my retirement party next year.

10:47.547 --> 10:48.548
( Chuckles )

10:51.084 --> 10:52.219
You know,
I played some ball myself.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.486
-No.
-I was a pitcher, yeah.

10:53.553 --> 10:54.822
What?
I actually hit 90 once
on the gun.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.089
Oh, my God.
That's some nice heat.

10:56.156 --> 10:57.324
-It was one time.
-Hey, hey, Dad.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.226
Um, I need to tell you
something, okay?

10:59.292 --> 11:01.228
And please, I don't want you
getting upset.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.796
Honey, please,
I'm gonna stop you, all right?

11:02.863 --> 11:04.497
Look, relax.

11:04.564 --> 11:05.966
I know I've been tough
on your boyfriends before,

11:06.033 --> 11:08.068
but I like this one.
Todd's a winner.

11:09.937 --> 11:12.973
It's not Todd.
It's Chale.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.675
Who's Chale?

11:15.743 --> 11:17.110
I'm Chale.

11:22.750 --> 11:27.020
We're in love.
It'll be a year in October.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.655
Uh, excuse me.
( Mumbles )

11:28.722 --> 11:31.158
Donna. Donna.

11:33.727 --> 11:35.829
Kendra's been dating a guy
for a year.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.131
Oh, she told you?
I asked her to wait.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.133
What?
You knew about this?
Yes, I did,

11:40.200 --> 11:42.269
but thank you for sticking
to the plan, honey.

11:42.335 --> 11:44.637
Well, I had to do something.
Dad was falling for Todd.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.007
Oh, uh...

11:47.074 --> 11:48.575
Of course I was.
He's awesome.

11:48.641 --> 11:50.110
But Chale --
nothing, no sparks.

11:50.177 --> 11:51.611
No --

11:51.678 --> 11:53.380
Why didn't you tell me
she's dating someone?

11:53.446 --> 11:55.682
Because I asked her
not to.

11:55.749 --> 11:58.786
And we're not dating.
We're engaged.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.553
Engaged?!

12:00.620 --> 12:01.621
What?!

12:02.589 --> 12:03.791
Hey, guys?

12:03.857 --> 12:07.460
One of your smoke detectors
is low on battery.

12:09.696 --> 12:11.431
Keeps chirping --
that's how you know.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.333
So, if you got a 9V
and stepladder...
Okay, thanks.
Good, yeah.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.468
...I'll bang it out for you
right now.
Yeah, appreciate it.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.172
Nobody is getting married,
okay?

12:19.239 --> 12:20.373
No, I agree.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.708
You need to focus on school
and then law school.

12:21.775 --> 12:23.043
Honey,
we talked about this.

12:23.110 --> 12:25.245
Okay, Mom,
Chale and I have a plan.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.614
And it starts with developing
his app.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.683
Guys, he's a visionary.
He wants to change the world.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.619
Well, you know what?
I want to go on tour
with Taylor Swift.

12:32.685 --> 12:35.088
But I don't know her,
and I don't play guitar.

12:37.224 --> 12:38.358
And in your mind,

12:38.425 --> 12:40.393
those are the only things
holding you back?

12:42.029 --> 12:44.197
To be continued.
Okay, listen to me.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.632
I want to hear
the rest of this plan.

12:45.698 --> 12:46.934
Okay, it's very simple.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.969
I got my old job back
at the diner,

12:49.036 --> 12:50.871
and...I'm dropping out
of school

12:50.938 --> 12:53.206
to support Chale
until he makes it big.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.507
-Okay.
-Honey, that's not a plan.

12:54.574 --> 12:57.410
That is literally
every stripper's backstory.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.181
You know what?
I-I have my own plan.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.951
Okay, I'm leaving, and I'm not
coming back till you...
No.

13:04.017 --> 13:07.254
...figure out how to make
things work with Todd. Todd!

13:10.723 --> 13:12.725
**

13:12.792 --> 13:15.662
Okay, everybody's gone now.
Can we talk?

13:15.728 --> 13:18.765
Not now.
I'm training.

13:18.832 --> 13:19.867
Come on.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.068
You haven't used that thing

13:21.134 --> 13:22.402
since you took it out
of the box eight years ago.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.636
It was six years ago,

13:23.703 --> 13:25.705
and you don't know
how many times I've used it.

13:25.772 --> 13:27.074
Uh, actually, Lance,

13:27.140 --> 13:30.277
the odometer tells me exactly
how much you've used it.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.545
Thank you for stopping.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.781
I'm not stopping.
I'm coasting down a hill.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.388
Okay.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.923
Look, we have a lot
to deal with,

13:42.990 --> 13:44.557
and I understand
that you're upset.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.193
No, no, no. You hid this
from me, all right,

13:46.259 --> 13:47.895
and that's now how we
do things in this family.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.062
Sometimes we do.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.363
There's a lot of stuff
that you don't know.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.132
I know everything
that goes on around here.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.566
I'm a cop.
Yeah, if --

13:53.633 --> 13:55.135
Even if you think
I don't know,
trust me, I know.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.070
Sara just got suspended
for fighting,

13:57.137 --> 13:59.940
and Jack started seeing the
school therapist for anxiety.

14:00.007 --> 14:03.410
Oof.
I didn't know that.

14:03.476 --> 14:06.079
Wow.
My head is spinning.

14:06.146 --> 14:07.915
I know.
It's a lot to throw at you.

14:07.981 --> 14:09.016
Nope, it's the bike.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.417
I haven't been on that thing
in years.

14:10.483 --> 14:12.619
( Sighs )

14:12.685 --> 14:14.888
I'm sorry, all right?
It's just...

14:14.955 --> 14:17.057
I mean,
everything was in place.

14:17.124 --> 14:19.259
Kendra was gonna blaze through
law school.

14:19.326 --> 14:22.295
Jack and Sara,
they were gonna...

14:22.362 --> 14:23.396
do something.

14:23.463 --> 14:24.464
I don't know.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.968
Now the guys
are bailing on me.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.802
It's like
we're all falling apart.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.704
Oh, honey, I know.

14:31.771 --> 14:33.573
But you're home now.

14:33.640 --> 14:36.409
You know, we'll get Jack and
Sara back on track together.

14:36.476 --> 14:39.646
Right now, we just need
to focus on Kendra.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.814
Yeah, she's going back
to school, that's it.
Agreed.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.250
And she's not marrying
that guy.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.651
He's a loser,
he's a bore-fest,

14:44.717 --> 14:46.686
and he -- he doesn't deserve
my daughter.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.055
Whoa.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.389
What?

14:49.456 --> 14:51.324
I just heard
my father's voice.

14:53.826 --> 14:57.864
That's exactly
what he said about you.

14:57.931 --> 15:00.533
I know.
Everybody heard the toast.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.469
**

15:06.306 --> 15:07.941
Dad,
what are you doing here?

15:08.008 --> 15:09.977
I came here to tell you you're
throwing your life away.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.444
Okay, I can't talk to you
right now.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.512
I'm working.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.881
( Clears throat )

15:16.049 --> 15:18.351
Now you got to talk to me.
I'm a customer.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.287
And by the way,
I'm on the Yelp now,

15:20.353 --> 15:22.055
so will bring
this place down.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.458
Well,
that's not my table,

15:25.525 --> 15:27.594
so good luck telling Ellie
how to live her life.

15:34.367 --> 15:37.104
-Hey, guys.
-( Scoffs )

15:37.170 --> 15:39.839
How's it going?

15:39.906 --> 15:41.608
Oh, the pot pie
looks sick, huh?

15:41.674 --> 15:43.010
Chock-full of chicken.

15:44.677 --> 15:47.014
-So you want to talk here?
-Just go to the counter.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.681
Okay.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.683
He thinks he's my dad.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.386
I don't understand you.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.055
Y-Y-You always make
great decisions.

15:55.122 --> 15:56.123
Why are you doing this?

15:56.189 --> 15:58.091
Dad,
why can't you trust me?

15:58.158 --> 16:00.493
And why can't you give Chale
a chance?

16:00.560 --> 16:02.295
He's sweet,
and you always told me

16:02.362 --> 16:05.132
to find someone
who respects me
and makes me feel special.

16:05.198 --> 16:08.768
I think we get all that
with Todd.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.970
Okay, Dad, look.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.773
This isn't easy for me.
Okay, my feet are killing me.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.575
I keep burning my fingers
on the stupid toaster,

16:15.642 --> 16:17.477
and I'm pretty sure the busboy
is stealing my tips.

16:17.544 --> 16:20.647
Yeah, I see you, Louie.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.550
Look, you and mom
were dead broke
when you started out,

16:23.616 --> 16:24.951
and you guys made it work.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.486
Chale and I can, too.

16:26.553 --> 16:29.156
Okay, look, look, stop, stop.
Okay, hey.

16:29.222 --> 16:32.625
All right, if you promise
to go to school down here,

16:32.692 --> 16:35.928
you and Chale can move
into the house, all right?

16:35.995 --> 16:37.664
I just --
I won't rent the garage.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.400
But I-I thought you needed
that for your retirement.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.369
We'll figure something out,
all right?

16:42.435 --> 16:43.436
Come on. I love you.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.072
( Sighs )

16:45.138 --> 16:47.174
Oh, thank you, Dad.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.111
Now you have to get Chale
on board.

16:51.178 --> 16:54.147
I got to what?

16:54.214 --> 16:56.283
You made a pretty bad
first impression.

16:56.349 --> 16:59.052
And -- And please,
please be careful.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.487
He's sensitive.

17:00.553 --> 17:01.888
Oh, yeah? Where?

17:01.954 --> 17:04.291
'Cause that's exactly where
I want to punch him.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.595
Hey, Chale.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.830
Uh, Mr. Gable, please.
There's no need for a scene.

17:10.897 --> 17:13.833
Obviously,
we are both alpha males.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.837
I'm texting Kendra.

17:17.904 --> 17:20.940
She shouldn't be
waiting tables,

17:21.007 --> 17:23.042
putting all of her dreams
on hold for mine.

17:23.110 --> 17:25.378
A-And now it's causing
problems with you.

17:25.445 --> 17:28.448
I love her so much,
but...

17:28.515 --> 17:30.350
I have to break up
with her.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.652
Oh.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.421
Well, you do your thing.
I just needed the mustard.

17:34.487 --> 17:37.124
That's all I wanted.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.163
Hey, Chale, don't, uh...

17:43.230 --> 17:44.631
Don't send that.

17:44.697 --> 17:47.967
Look, uh, I want Kendra
to stay in school,

17:48.034 --> 17:49.902
so she's gonna come back
and live in the house.

17:49.969 --> 17:55.942
And I...I'd like you
to live there...too.

17:56.008 --> 17:58.311
Oh, well, that --
that's really generous.

17:58.378 --> 17:59.646
I -- Yes, you've got me.

17:59.712 --> 18:01.614
Uh, we're practically
family now.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.150
I'm not normally
a hugger.

18:03.216 --> 18:04.751
Good, then we're good.
Okay.

18:10.223 --> 18:11.824
We got charged 90 bucks

18:11.891 --> 18:14.994
for four tubs
of Muscle Milk protein powder.

18:15.061 --> 18:17.297
Oh, that was me.

18:17.364 --> 18:20.267
I was watching "Rocky III,"
and I got all fired up.

18:22.635 --> 18:25.238
And then I, uh...

18:25.305 --> 18:26.773
I'll return it.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.741
Thank you.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.611
Oh. So, how's
the job search going?

18:31.678 --> 18:33.246
I don't want to count
my chickens,

18:33.313 --> 18:34.881
but you could be
sleeping with the guy

18:34.947 --> 18:36.849
who's in charge
of securing the perimeter

18:36.916 --> 18:37.950
of Hempstead Auto Mall.

18:38.017 --> 18:40.653
Ooh.
I like the sound of that.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.989
No, I mean you're gonna
have to sleep with that
guy so I get the job.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.123
That's what
I'm talking about.

18:44.191 --> 18:46.193
Whatever I got to do.
( Chuckles )

18:46.259 --> 18:48.861
Hey, come here.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.230
You're pretty awesome.

18:50.297 --> 18:51.564
What was that for?

18:51.631 --> 18:53.266
Aw, you know what
I'm talking about.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.169
You did a great thing
for your daughter.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.037
We'll make it work.
It's -- It's what we do.

18:58.104 --> 19:00.407
But I know you think
your retirement is screwed up.

19:00.473 --> 19:04.311
No, I had two days.
It was a good run.

19:04.377 --> 19:06.213
No, I know you had
your heart set

19:06.279 --> 19:09.916
on building an indoor zip line
or going to ninja camp or...

19:09.982 --> 19:11.318
I don't know.

19:11.384 --> 19:14.187
So, you don't get to race
go-karts with paintball guns.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.556
You do get to spend a lot
more time with your kids,

19:16.623 --> 19:19.259
and at the end of the day,
isn't that ultimately better?

19:22.495 --> 19:25.298
Kevin: Four two decades,
we protected and served.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.467
Now we rule these streets.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.436
Dad, my --
my seat's wobbly.

19:29.502 --> 19:32.038
Yeah, that's 'cause I, uh --
I added it last night,

19:32.104 --> 19:33.740
and the light
wasn't too good.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.575
But (clears throat)
hey, listen,
if we get separated,

19:35.642 --> 19:36.976
just meet back at the house,
all right?

19:37.043 --> 19:39.178
You're gonna be good.

19:39.246 --> 19:43.149
3...2...1!

19:43.216 --> 19:44.451
Go!

19:44.517 --> 19:49.322
**

19:49.389 --> 19:51.524
( Screaming )

19:51.591 --> 19:52.925
Come on!

19:57.530 --> 19:59.466
Enjoy the bushes, Goody.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.967
( Screams )

20:07.507 --> 20:10.042
Aah! Come on!

20:12.879 --> 20:14.013
On the right.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.114
( Tires screech )

20:15.915 --> 20:17.984
( Laughs ) Ohh.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.788
( Tires screech )

20:21.854 --> 20:23.022
Look out!

20:27.226 --> 20:30.029
-Oh! Oh! Ow!
-Yeah!

20:30.096 --> 20:31.731
Whoo-hoo!

20:31.798 --> 20:33.400
( Tires screech )

20:33.466 --> 20:35.902
Yeah, baby!
I win!

20:35.968 --> 20:37.837
( Laughs )

20:37.904 --> 20:41.441
* Don't want
no sweet perfumes *

20:41.508 --> 20:44.977
* Shake your thing,
don't bust your move *

20:45.044 --> 20:48.748
* Doo doo-doo doo-doo,
doo-doo-doo *

20:48.815 --> 20:52.184
* Ohh, yeah

20:52.251 --> 20:55.288
* Don't want
no high-heeled shoes *

20:55.355 --> 20:58.090
* I just don't want no...
