WEBVTT

00:02.117 --> 00:04.285
Advantage left-side competitor.

00:06.872 --> 00:08.406
Wow, you're really
good at this.

00:08.408 --> 00:11.576
Well, I have an extremely
low center of gravity.

00:11.578 --> 00:14.796
I'm like a pyramid.

00:17.249 --> 00:18.499
How you doing over there?

00:18.501 --> 00:22.003
Oh, I hope it's just a sprain.

00:22.671 --> 00:24.255
I cannot walk into that E.R.

00:24.257 --> 00:27.441
with another video game injury.

00:27.443 --> 00:29.760
Hey, Sheldon,
you want to play next?

00:29.762 --> 00:32.146
Oh, I would, but
I'm on my way out.

00:32.148 --> 00:35.382
Where?
Texas.

00:35.384 --> 00:37.351
Right now?

00:37.353 --> 00:38.436
Why?

00:38.438 --> 00:39.921
Is someone sick?
Yes.

00:39.923 --> 00:43.524
My sister's uterus came
down with a baby.

00:44.626 --> 00:46.360
Oh, she's pregnant?
That's great.

00:46.362 --> 00:48.329
You're gone an uncle--
Uncle Sheldon.

00:48.331 --> 00:51.065
No, I will be
Uncle Dr. Cooper.

00:51.950 --> 00:54.035
How come you never said
she was pregnant?

00:54.037 --> 00:56.037
Well, I never told you
about my brother's kidney stone.

00:56.039 --> 00:57.288
You want to hear
about everything

00:57.290 --> 00:59.373
that comes out
of my family's genitals?

01:00.342 --> 01:01.909
Well, congrats, and it's nice

01:01.911 --> 01:03.340
you're gonna be there
for your sister.

01:03.341 --> 01:04.069
Yes.

01:04.129 --> 01:06.080
I'm filling in for her husband
who's recovering

01:06.082 --> 01:08.382
from a horrible
motorcycle accident.

01:08.384 --> 01:10.601
Lucky duck.

01:10.603 --> 01:13.420
Wow, so, how long
will you be gone?

01:13.422 --> 01:15.223
Well, she's due tomorrow.

01:15.225 --> 01:17.308
Although it did take her six
years to finish high school,

01:17.310 --> 01:18.759
so who knows?

01:18.761 --> 01:20.978
Can I give you a ride
to the airport?

01:20.980 --> 01:23.597
Oh, no, thank you, I don't want
to be an inconvenience.

01:23.599 --> 01:24.899
Chop-chop, Leonard.

01:57.607 --> 01:59.658
All right, here's the deal.

01:59.760 --> 02:01.877
Sheldon is gone,
so the tree decorating rules

02:01.879 --> 02:02.911
are out the window.

02:02.913 --> 02:03.929
Yeah, which means

02:03.931 --> 02:05.431
we don't have to use
his ridiculous

02:05.433 --> 02:08.333
ornament-spacing template.

02:08.335 --> 02:10.519
And I'm happy to report
its kickstarter campaign

02:10.520 --> 02:13.388
is holding strong at zero dollars.
Ah.

02:13.390 --> 02:16.308
Wait, so <i>Star Wars</i>
and <i>Star Trek</i> characters

02:16.310 --> 02:18.593
can go on the same branch?

02:18.595 --> 02:19.895
I know, it's crazy.

02:19.897 --> 02:21.930
Welcome to the Thunderdome,
people!

02:23.734 --> 02:25.100
I've never done this before.

02:25.102 --> 02:26.401
It's kind of fun.

02:26.403 --> 02:27.435
Yeah, if your mom could see

02:27.437 --> 02:28.754
her little Bar Mitzvah boy
right now,

02:28.756 --> 02:29.872
she'd have a heart attack.

02:29.874 --> 02:32.374
Good idea, I'll take a picture.

02:36.445 --> 02:38.330
Honey, I'm a little strapped
for cash this year,

02:38.332 --> 02:41.633
so for Christmas I was
thinking of giving you...

02:41.635 --> 02:44.503
this.

02:44.505 --> 02:45.838
I love it.

02:45.840 --> 02:47.172
Okay.

02:47.174 --> 02:49.141
But it is what you got me
last year.

02:49.143 --> 02:51.176
Yeah.
And last night.

02:53.264 --> 02:54.813
Hello.

02:54.815 --> 02:56.181
Hi, Stuart.

02:56.183 --> 02:57.232
Oh, good, I'm glad you guys

02:57.234 --> 02:58.567
didn't wait for me to start.

02:58.569 --> 02:59.801
Although you said 7:00

02:59.803 --> 03:02.688
and it's-it's 7:00,
but that's fine.

03:04.992 --> 03:08.443
Oh, it's probably Sheldon.

03:08.445 --> 03:09.561
Hi, Sheldon.

03:09.563 --> 03:11.830
Everybody's here, say hi.

03:11.832 --> 03:12.981
Hey. - Hey.
Hey, buddy.

03:12.983 --> 03:14.482
Howdy.
Hi.

03:14.484 --> 03:16.251
Hello.

03:18.171 --> 03:19.338
The second I go out of town

03:19.340 --> 03:21.656
you throw a Christmas party
without me?

03:21.658 --> 03:23.292
Yeah, kind of.

03:23.294 --> 03:24.960
That's so thoughtful.

03:24.962 --> 03:26.795
You guys are the best.

03:26.797 --> 03:29.515
Hey, how's your sister?

03:29.517 --> 03:32.050
She went into labor an hour ago.

03:32.052 --> 03:34.502
That's wonderful.
So you're at the hospital?

03:34.504 --> 03:37.272
No, she chose to have a home
birth... because she wants

03:37.274 --> 03:41.176
to live in the Stone Age
and a cave wasn't available.

03:41.178 --> 03:44.363
You know, many
people believe

03:44.365 --> 03:46.365
that home births are
better because the mother

03:46.367 --> 03:47.866
is in a warm,
comfortable environment

03:47.868 --> 03:49.952
where she can be nurtured
by loved ones.

03:49.954 --> 03:51.703
And turn the bedroom floor

03:51.705 --> 03:54.689
into an amniotic Slip 'n Slide.

03:55.491 --> 03:57.409
Shelly, come on!

03:57.411 --> 03:59.711
Your sister's fully dilated

03:59.713 --> 04:01.997
and she wants
a nice family picture

04:01.999 --> 04:05.083
before there's blood everywhere!

04:05.085 --> 04:06.701
Oh, boy.

04:06.703 --> 04:10.372
I picked the wrong day
to wear my good robot T-shirt.

04:12.592 --> 04:14.343
If you were having
Sheldon's baby

04:14.345 --> 04:16.310
would you really want
him in the room?

04:16.313 --> 04:18.213
Yeah, if he's in the room
when they're making the baby,

04:18.214 --> 04:20.766
I'll give you ten dollars.

04:21.733 --> 04:23.101
Hey, I brought over
<i>It's a Wonderful Life</i>

04:23.103 --> 04:24.820
if you guys want
to watch it later.

04:24.822 --> 04:26.054
Oh, I love that movie.

04:26.056 --> 04:27.022
I've never seen it.

04:27.024 --> 04:28.924
- Me neither.
- It's great.

04:28.926 --> 04:31.777
It's Christmastime and
Jimmy Stewart's really depressed

04:31.779 --> 04:34.329
and he's gonna jump off a bridge
and kill himself...

04:34.331 --> 04:36.548
Don't need to see it.
Living it.

04:37.533 --> 04:38.667
But then he gets to see
what the world

04:38.669 --> 04:41.069
would be like
if he'd never been born.

04:41.071 --> 04:42.454
Hey, you ever imagine
what that would be like?

04:42.456 --> 04:43.839
Not being born?

04:43.841 --> 04:45.573
What do you think?

04:45.575 --> 04:47.009
What do you think?

04:47.011 --> 04:49.177
What do you think?

04:51.047 --> 04:53.015
You make jokes about Sheldon,

04:53.017 --> 04:54.349
but if it weren't
for him,

04:54.351 --> 04:55.701
I don't think
any of us

04:55.703 --> 04:57.636
would be sitting
in this room right now.

04:57.638 --> 04:59.221
Really? Sheldon not being here

04:59.223 --> 05:02.057
is the main reason
I'm in this room.

05:03.626 --> 05:04.926
It's true.

05:04.928 --> 05:06.645
None of you would know me.

05:06.647 --> 05:08.397
You wouldn't
know Bernadette.

05:08.399 --> 05:10.816
You wouldn't be dating Penny.
You don't know that.

05:10.818 --> 05:12.618
I've been going to the
Cheesecake Factory for years.

05:12.620 --> 05:13.735
I could have picked her up.

05:17.574 --> 05:20.442
Oh, you weren't joking.

05:20.444 --> 05:21.376
No.

05:21.378 --> 05:22.911
Okay, sweetie,
let me tell you

05:22.913 --> 05:24.997
exactly how that
would have gone down.

05:27.834 --> 05:29.668
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna ask her out.

05:29.670 --> 05:34.172
I'm gonna squirt chocolate milk
out of my nipples.

05:34.174 --> 05:36.291
Sorry, I thought
we're saying things

05:36.293 --> 05:38.010
that are never
gonna happen.

05:38.012 --> 05:40.395
Maybe this time
he's going to do it.

05:40.397 --> 05:42.347
Hope you're thirsty,
here it comes.

05:45.018 --> 05:46.401
Watch me.

05:46.403 --> 05:49.771
Hey, you guys ready to order
or you need a few minutes?

05:49.773 --> 05:51.056
I, uh, ah, um, I...

05:51.058 --> 05:52.607
A few minutes it is.

05:53.976 --> 05:56.912
You didn't ask her out,
but that was a lot of sounds.

05:58.614 --> 06:00.365
You guys are
making me nervous.

06:00.367 --> 06:02.084
Fine, then go talk
to her on your own.

06:02.086 --> 06:04.119
I will.

06:11.177 --> 06:12.377
Excuse me.

06:12.379 --> 06:13.628
Yeah?

06:13.630 --> 06:16.831
Hi, uh, um, I'm Leonard?

06:16.833 --> 06:19.834
Really? You don't
sound so sure.

06:19.836 --> 06:22.804
No, I am he.

06:25.191 --> 06:27.175
Uh, any-anyway, um,

06:27.177 --> 06:29.311
there's been something
I've wanted to ask you

06:29.313 --> 06:31.446
for a long time. Um...

06:31.448 --> 06:33.281
What's that?
Eh, uh, well,

06:33.283 --> 06:35.683
I was wondering--
if you're not too busy--

06:35.685 --> 06:37.102
um, uh, if,

06:37.104 --> 06:39.788
if you'd be interested in...

06:40.573 --> 06:44.076
...telling me where
the restroom is?

06:47.630 --> 06:49.247
I think you're too late.

06:49.249 --> 06:53.969
Come on, I would not
have peed my pants.

06:53.971 --> 06:55.870
She nailed it.
Sounds about right.

06:56.889 --> 06:59.508
But, you forget, I did
ask you out in real life.

06:59.510 --> 07:01.977
Which couldn't have happened if
you didn't live across the hall

07:01.979 --> 07:04.312
from her, which couldn't have
happened without Sheldon.

07:04.314 --> 07:05.814
Same goes
with you guys.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.182
If Leonard wasn't with Penny,

07:07.184 --> 07:08.683
she never would
have set you up.

07:08.685 --> 07:10.552
Doesn't matter. Bernadette
still would've been working

07:10.554 --> 07:11.853
at The Cheesecake Factory,

07:11.855 --> 07:14.889
and I still would've been
working this beefcake factory.

07:16.526 --> 07:18.994
You would've been all over me.

07:18.996 --> 07:20.695
Well...

07:23.116 --> 07:25.000
Hey, Penny, can
I take that table?

07:25.002 --> 07:26.118
Sure, why?

07:26.120 --> 07:28.253
The one in the turtleneck
is cute.

07:28.255 --> 07:29.737
Open wide,

07:29.739 --> 07:32.290
here comes the happy train.

07:33.843 --> 07:37.579
Mm-hmm, chug-a
chug-a, yum, yum.

07:38.914 --> 07:40.966
Oh.

07:40.968 --> 07:42.750
Hang on.

07:43.686 --> 07:46.188
You got a... you got
a little something.

07:49.475 --> 07:51.092
Never mind.

07:52.779 --> 07:54.646
Oh, man,

07:54.648 --> 07:57.098
that is so us.

08:01.154 --> 08:03.121
You know, maybe you and
I wouldn't be together,

08:03.123 --> 08:04.939
but you wouldn't have
done so great yourself.

08:04.941 --> 08:06.441
Why?
Because I know exactly

08:06.443 --> 08:08.610
the kind of guy you
would've ended up with.

08:11.380 --> 08:13.381
Hey, babe.

08:13.383 --> 08:15.050
Hey. Did you remember
to pay the rent?

08:15.052 --> 08:17.836
Better. I used the money
to buy these magic beans.

08:19.005 --> 08:21.089
Hey, he may be
an idiot, but at least

08:21.091 --> 08:22.841
he didn't pee himself.

08:24.627 --> 08:26.845
Oh, hold on.

08:27.814 --> 08:29.797
Aw, babe, I peed myself.

08:31.567 --> 08:33.818
Me, too.

08:40.076 --> 08:43.445
The end.

08:47.450 --> 08:48.867
Hi, Sheldon.

08:48.869 --> 08:50.151
Everything okay?

08:50.153 --> 08:52.871
No, it's not.

08:52.873 --> 08:54.708
I've seen things.

08:55.889 --> 09:00.161
Lady things.

09:00.162 --> 09:01.829
Listen to me.

09:01.831 --> 09:04.666
That is not the way
they usually look.

09:07.487 --> 09:09.104
Doesn't matter.

09:09.106 --> 09:11.773
This is no way
to make new humans.

09:11.775 --> 09:14.059
People coming out of people.

09:15.561 --> 09:17.896
It's some kind
of dirty magic show.

09:17.898 --> 09:20.565
Sheldon Lee Cooper.

09:20.567 --> 09:23.401
You get back
in this room right now.

09:23.403 --> 09:25.687
Bring a mop.

09:25.689 --> 09:27.021
Did you hear that?

09:27.023 --> 09:28.690
A mop.

09:28.692 --> 09:31.159
I have two PhDs yet somehow
I'm the janitor

09:31.161 --> 09:33.128
of my sister's birth canal.

09:35.000 --> 09:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:42.674 --> 09:44.759
Hey, Sheldon sent us all

09:44.761 --> 09:45.959
an e-mail.

09:45.961 --> 09:47.895
"Happy holidays from Texas."
Aw.

09:47.897 --> 09:49.096
And there's pictures.

09:49.098 --> 09:50.164
Aah!

09:50.166 --> 09:52.233
Don't open them.
Do <i>not</i> open them.

09:52.235 --> 09:54.185
Oh, come on.

09:54.187 --> 09:56.153
Childbirth is a
natural, beautiful...

09:56.155 --> 09:59.190
Oh, it's like someone
sawed a cow in half.

10:02.077 --> 10:05.863
My father's a gynecologist,
I think I can handle it.

10:06.498 --> 10:09.050
And, now, I'm gay.

10:11.370 --> 10:13.153
You know, I was thinking.
Without Sheldon,

10:13.155 --> 10:14.505
most of us would have never met,

10:14.507 --> 10:16.590
but Penny would still
live across from him.

10:16.592 --> 10:19.493
And with Leonard
out of the picture,

10:19.495 --> 10:21.095
we all know what
that would mean.

10:21.097 --> 10:22.730
We do?

10:25.984 --> 10:27.601
Hey, Sheldon.

10:27.603 --> 10:29.770
Hello.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.807
Doing laundry?

10:36.812 --> 10:38.979
Of course
I'm doing laundry.

10:38.981 --> 10:40.698
Saturday night is laundry night,

10:40.700 --> 10:43.183
and I'm in a laundry room, so...

10:43.185 --> 10:45.069
I believe your inference
is justified.

10:45.071 --> 10:47.621
Oh, my
inference is justified.

10:47.623 --> 10:50.157
Sheldon, you
are so funny.

10:52.911 --> 10:55.463
Anyway, I need to
do my laundry, too,

10:55.465 --> 10:58.866
because these
clothes are so dirty.

10:58.868 --> 11:02.670
Almost as dirty as the dirty
girl who's wearing them.

11:05.206 --> 11:06.140
Okay, that's enough.

11:06.142 --> 11:08.693
Disagree.
Keep going. - More.

11:10.379 --> 11:13.180
So, what do you think?

11:13.182 --> 11:18.319
A tad asymmetrical, but nothing
to be concerned about.

11:19.654 --> 11:21.689
Please, Sheldon. I need you.

11:21.691 --> 11:25.059
To... what?

11:25.061 --> 11:27.161
To take me.

11:27.163 --> 11:30.698
I'm not taking you anywhere
till you put on a shirt.

11:31.867 --> 11:35.235
Come on, Sheldon.
You and me right here.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.922
Penny, for the thousandth time,

11:37.924 --> 11:41.074
I'm saving myself
for someone special.

11:41.076 --> 11:44.044
Perhaps a cute
bespectacled neuroscientist

11:44.046 --> 11:48.549
with hair
the color of mud.

11:48.551 --> 11:51.185
I think I know how
to change your mind.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.305
That's enough.
Ew...

11:55.190 --> 11:57.558
I was okay with it.

12:01.864 --> 12:04.064
How's it going, Sheldon?

12:04.066 --> 12:05.483
Actually, much better.

12:05.485 --> 12:06.984
Oh, good.
Is the baby born yet?

12:06.986 --> 12:09.136
I don't know. I just got back.

12:09.138 --> 12:10.204
Where'd you go?

12:10.206 --> 12:13.207
My mother asked me
to get some towels.

12:13.209 --> 12:15.442
I took advantage
of the vague request

12:15.444 --> 12:18.012
and went to Bed,
Bath & Beyond.

12:20.950 --> 12:23.951
Excuse me! I'm on the phone!

12:25.420 --> 12:28.355
So rude.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.709
Here's another one.
Penny,

12:31.711 --> 12:33.093
if it weren't for Sheldon,

12:33.095 --> 12:37.681
you never would have met
comic book legend Stan Lee.

12:38.817 --> 12:41.068
Great.

12:42.020 --> 12:43.137
At least Leonard,

12:43.139 --> 12:46.173
Howard and I would have
always been friends.

12:46.175 --> 12:48.909
Hey, how come you three never
got an apartment together?

12:48.911 --> 12:51.144
We talked about it,
but Howard was in

12:51.146 --> 12:54.331
a pretty serious
relationship with his mom.

12:54.333 --> 12:57.001
I lived with her to save money.

12:57.003 --> 12:58.385
Yeah, you didn't have
to buy groceries

12:58.387 --> 12:59.420
'cause you were breast-feeding.

13:00.456 --> 13:03.757
Aw, so I guess
if it weren't for me,

13:03.759 --> 13:05.509
you'd still be living
with her, huh?

13:05.511 --> 13:07.511
Not exactly.

13:07.513 --> 13:08.762
What do you mean, "not exactly"?

13:08.764 --> 13:11.999
Well, things would be
a little different.

13:12.001 --> 13:15.002
Howard, where's my lunch?!

13:15.004 --> 13:18.138
I'm starving!

13:18.140 --> 13:19.607
I know you're starving.

13:19.609 --> 13:21.392
The neighbors know
you're starving.

13:21.394 --> 13:24.678
There's starving people in
Africa who know you're starving!

13:26.565 --> 13:29.250
That's it?!
There's not enough food!

13:29.252 --> 13:33.554
Well, you cleaned out Earth!
I don't know what else to do!

13:34.139 --> 13:36.807
How is this
any different?

13:36.809 --> 13:39.293
You didn't let me finish.

13:39.295 --> 13:41.795
Here you go, Mother.

13:41.797 --> 13:44.298
You're a good boy, Howard!

13:44.300 --> 13:48.085
Such a good boy!

13:52.874 --> 13:55.242
Wait-- did she die
or did you kill her?

13:57.379 --> 14:01.015
Eh, tomato, tomahto. The
important thing is she's dead.

14:02.684 --> 14:05.769
Hey, so how come you two
didn't move in together?

14:05.771 --> 14:07.521
This guy wanted
a place of his own

14:07.523 --> 14:09.823
because he was sure he was
gonna be a ladies' man.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.444
Yeah, I was wrong.

14:14.529 --> 14:17.364
But I do think you and I
would have had a great time.

14:17.366 --> 14:20.251
Come on, Leonard, dinner.

14:20.253 --> 14:22.186
Coming.

14:30.962 --> 14:32.162
<i>Hang on.</i>

14:32.164 --> 14:33.847
Why would I be fat?

14:34.933 --> 14:37.301
You'd have no girlfriend
to see you naked,

14:37.303 --> 14:40.054
you'd try to fill the void
with food,

14:40.056 --> 14:43.256
and I'm an enabler who once
deep-fried a pancake.

14:43.858 --> 14:45.976
Why can't you be fat, too?

14:47.562 --> 14:50.281
What do you want
to do for dessert?

14:52.317 --> 14:55.419
I think there's still
half a cake from breakfast.

14:57.205 --> 14:59.373
No, there's not.

15:04.129 --> 15:07.081
Hey, guys.

15:07.083 --> 15:08.999
Stuart.
Stuart.

15:09.001 --> 15:11.001
What are you doing?

15:11.003 --> 15:12.886
I...

15:12.888 --> 15:18.342
just wanted to be
in anyone's story.

15:18.344 --> 15:20.711
Yeah, but why are you fat?

15:22.764 --> 15:25.265
'Cause Leonard was fat.

15:27.102 --> 15:28.736
Amy, what about you?

15:28.738 --> 15:30.938
What do you think you'd be doing
if you never met Sheldon?

15:30.940 --> 15:33.073
It's hard to say,

15:33.075 --> 15:35.326
my life would be
so... different.

15:35.328 --> 15:38.979
You can say "better."
Sheldon can't hear you.

15:40.248 --> 15:41.649
I don't know.

15:42.817 --> 15:46.887
♪ Happy birthday to me

15:47.656 --> 15:51.692
♪ Happy birthday
to me ♪

15:53.094 --> 15:57.297
♪ There's tears
in the frosting ♪

16:03.905 --> 16:08.042
♪ Happy birthday to me.

16:17.485 --> 16:19.153
I'll stop now.

16:22.657 --> 16:24.241
How's it going, Sheldon?

16:24.243 --> 16:25.692
That's it.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.461
The baby's here.

16:27.463 --> 16:28.528
It's a boy.

16:28.530 --> 16:30.330
Congrats.
Aw. - Yay.

16:30.332 --> 16:32.049
Oh, thank you.

16:32.051 --> 16:34.367
I wasn't sure I was
gonna to make it.

16:36.004 --> 16:39.056
But my mother
gave me some ice chips,

16:39.058 --> 16:41.091
my sister told me to breathe.

16:41.093 --> 16:43.043
And I just thought
to myself, "Sheldon,

16:43.045 --> 16:45.229
"if you can make it through
the <i>Green Lantern</i> movie,

16:45.231 --> 16:47.380
you can make it through this."

16:47.382 --> 16:49.750
Well, good
for you, buddy.

16:49.752 --> 16:51.201
We'll let you
get back in there.

16:51.203 --> 16:53.153
Oh no, no, I'm not
going back in there.

16:53.155 --> 16:55.889
That baby is so irritating.

16:55.891 --> 16:59.159
He has literally been
crying his entire life.

17:00.361 --> 17:03.297
Aw, he's already taking
after Uncle Shelly.

17:04.499 --> 17:06.416
Come on, Sheldon, you should go.

17:06.419 --> 17:07.584
Why?

17:07.586 --> 17:09.520
Well, you always
complain that you never

17:09.521 --> 17:11.588
had an intelligent
role model growing up,

17:11.589 --> 17:13.824
and now you can
be one for your nephew.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.045
Ugh, all right, I'll go.

17:18.997 --> 17:21.013
But from what I've seen,
his attention span

17:21.016 --> 17:23.467
is as limited
as his bladder control.

17:24.803 --> 17:26.720
You actually
got him to do it.

17:26.722 --> 17:27.921
Yeah, you keep saying

17:27.923 --> 17:29.640
how much Sheldon has
affected all of us,

17:29.642 --> 17:32.025
but you've clearly
had an impact on him.

17:32.027 --> 17:33.644
If that were true,

17:33.646 --> 17:35.612
I wouldn't still
be living alone.

17:35.614 --> 17:36.930
Well, not exactly alone.

17:36.932 --> 17:39.199
I do have a 50 pound
sack of rice

17:39.201 --> 17:42.069
with one of Sheldon's
T-shirts on it.

17:44.672 --> 17:47.875
I'm telling you, Sheldon cares
for you more than you think.

17:47.877 --> 17:50.443
I wish I could believe you.

17:50.445 --> 17:53.147
I also wish there wasn't a mouse
living in Rice Sheldon.

17:56.284 --> 17:58.001
Hang on, I'm gonna
give you a little

17:58.003 --> 18:00.287
early Christmas
present.

18:00.289 --> 18:02.840
I'm gonna show you something,
but if you ever told Sheldon

18:02.842 --> 18:04.758
he'd probably never
speak to me again.

18:04.760 --> 18:07.344
So, if you want to
tell him, that's fine.

18:07.346 --> 18:09.429
Look.

18:12.183 --> 18:14.568
I don't understand.

18:14.570 --> 18:16.987
He made you
his screensaver.

18:18.139 --> 18:19.940
Oh.

18:19.942 --> 18:21.074
Wow.

18:21.076 --> 18:24.278
I had no idea.

18:24.280 --> 18:26.914
He is so into me.

18:28.783 --> 18:30.267
Wait, wait,

18:30.269 --> 18:31.318
where'd I go?

18:31.320 --> 18:33.670
Oh, well, it's
you, Swamp Thing,

18:33.672 --> 18:34.705
Stephen Hawking,
Spider-Man...

18:34.707 --> 18:37.174
but, look, you're
in the mix.

18:37.176 --> 18:39.492
I <i>am</i> in the mix.

18:39.494 --> 18:41.461
And I'm the hottest one.

18:41.463 --> 18:42.713
Who's that?

18:42.715 --> 18:44.464
Oh, Madame C.

18:44.466 --> 18:46.633
That's fine, she's dead.

18:59.113 --> 19:00.814
You okay?

19:01.733 --> 19:04.017
Just really glad
you're back.

19:04.019 --> 19:05.652
Me, too.

19:06.739 --> 19:09.356
I got a lot of TV
to catch up on.

19:15.213 --> 19:17.297
I missed you.

19:17.299 --> 19:20.834
To quote Han Solo,
"I know""

19:24.538 --> 19:26.473
Did you miss me?

19:26.475 --> 19:29.059
I would've preferred
to have you there with me.

19:29.061 --> 19:30.761
Oh.

19:30.763 --> 19:32.596
Or instead of me.

19:35.883 --> 19:37.267
Did you hold the baby?

19:37.269 --> 19:38.852
I did.

19:38.854 --> 19:40.354
And?

19:40.356 --> 19:42.739
How did it make you feel?

19:42.741 --> 19:45.025
Looking into the
blank, innocent eyes

19:45.027 --> 19:47.194
of a creature that
couldn't begin to comprehend

19:47.196 --> 19:48.895
anything I was saying?

19:48.897 --> 19:51.748
Basically just
another day at the office.

20:00.426 --> 20:02.127
I'm gonna do it.

20:02.129 --> 20:03.762
I'm gonna ask her out.

20:06.015 --> 20:09.501
Yeah, and chocolate milk is
gonna squirt out of my nipples.

20:10.470 --> 20:13.171
Put up or shut up.
You make it, I'll drink it.

20:18.311 --> 20:19.695
You guys need anything else?
Uh,

20:19.697 --> 20:22.147
your phone number
and one more cheesecake.

20:24.817 --> 20:26.451
I'm sorry, I have a boyfriend.

20:26.453 --> 20:29.288
In fact, there
he is now.

20:38.222 --> 20:39.609
Ready to go, sweetheart?

20:39.610 --> 20:41.860
Not until I get
my kiss.
