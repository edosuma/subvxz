I'M JOHN OLIVER.

THANK YOU SO MUCH

FOR JOINING US.

00:38.700 --> 00:39.700
AND WE BEGIN TONIGHT

00:39.700 --> 00:41.133
WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP,

00:41.133 --> 00:42.500
THE PERSON WHO MOST DESERVES

00:42.500 --> 00:44.567
TO LOOK LIKE THAT.

00:44.567 --> 00:46.800
AND I KNOW, RIGHT NOW, ALL

00:46.800 --> 00:48.700
ANYONE CAN THINK ABOUT IS THE

00:56.834 --> 00:57.767
BEFORE THAT, INCLUDING TRUMP

00:57.767 --> 00:58.600
ADDRESSING AMERICA'S

00:58.600 --> 01:00.967
OPIOID CRISIS, WHICH CLAIMS 140

01:00.967 --> 01:04.567
LIVES EVERY DAY OR, AS ONE

01:04.567 --> 01:05.567
NEWSCASTER PUT IT...

01:05.567 --> 01:06.300
>> GOOD EVENING.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.400
I'M ANTHONY MASON.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.700
AND BY THE TIME THIS BROADCAST

01:08.700 --> 01:10.066
IS OVER, THREE PEOPLE WILL BE

01:10.066 --> 01:11.834
DEAD.

01:11.834 --> 01:14.767
>> John: HOLY SHIT!

01:14.767 --> 01:16.533
THE ONLY THING CREEPIER THAN

01:16.533 --> 01:18.867
THAT IS IF HE SPECIFICALLY

01:18.867 --> 01:20.767
NAMED WHO THOSE PEOPLE ARE.

01:20.767 --> 01:22.066
"THREE PEOPLE WILL BE DEAD:

01:22.066 --> 01:23.000
JASON KOHLER OF WALTHAM,

01:29.967 --> 01:31.800
COMBATING AMERICA'S OPIOID

01:31.800 --> 01:32.600
CRISIS WAS ONE OF TRUMP'S

01:32.600 --> 01:33.800
CENTRAL CAMPAIGN PROMISES.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.734
BUT I HAVE TO SAY, A LOT OF HIS

01:35.734 --> 01:37.367
SOLUTIONS WERE UNDERWHELMING,

01:37.367 --> 01:38.066
INCLUDING ONE OF THE KEY

01:38.066 --> 01:40.033
ANNOUNCEMENTS ON THURSDAY.

01:40.033 --> 01:42.367
>> IT'S REALLY, REALLY EASY

01:42.367 --> 01:43.633
NOT TO TAKE 'EM.

01:43.633 --> 01:44.600
AND I THINK THAT'S GOING

01:44.600 --> 01:45.967
TO END UP BEING OUR MOST

01:45.967 --> 01:47.300
IMPORTANT THING.

01:47.300 --> 01:49.834
REALLY TOUGH, REALLY BIG,

01:49.834 --> 01:52.800
REALLY GREAT ADVERTISING, SO WE

01:52.800 --> 01:55.600
GET TO PEOPLE BEFORE THEY START.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.533
>> John: SO AN AD CAMPAIGN.

01:57.533 --> 01:58.633
SURE, IT'S IMPORTANT

01:58.633 --> 02:00.200
NOT TO START ABUSING OPIOIDS,

02:00.200 --> 02:01.567
BUT THAT DOESN'T HELP THE PEOPLE

02:01.567 --> 02:02.600
WHO ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING

02:02.600 --> 02:03.600
WITH ADDICTION.

02:03.600 --> 02:04.834
IT'S KIND OF LIKE SEEING SOMEONE

02:04.834 --> 02:06.300
NECK DEEP IN QUICKSAND

02:06.300 --> 02:07.834
AND PUTTING UP A

02:07.834 --> 02:10.700
"DON'T DO QUICKSAND" SIGN.

02:10.700 --> 02:12.433
ALSO, THE AD BLITZ STRATEGY

02:12.433 --> 02:13.300
HAS FAMOUSLY BEEN TRIED

02:13.300 --> 02:14.166
AND FAILED

02:14.166 --> 02:15.133
BEFORE WITH NANCY REAGAN'S

02:15.133 --> 02:16.867
"JUST SAY NO" CAMPAIGN.

02:16.867 --> 02:18.300
AND YET, IT STILL SEEMS TO BE

02:18.300 --> 02:19.500
TRUMP'S PREFERRED APPROACH,

02:19.500 --> 02:20.767
GOING BY WHAT HAPPENED AT ONE OF

02:20.767 --> 02:22.767
HIS RALLIES LAST YEAR.

02:22.767 --> 02:24.433
>> DON'T TAKE DRUGS.

02:24.433 --> 02:25.133
OKAY?

02:25.133 --> 02:26.500
RAISE YOUR HAND.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.266
RAISE YOUR HAND.

02:28.266 --> 02:32.133
I PROMISE DONALD J. TRUMP THAT I

02:32.133 --> 02:37.000
WILL NEVER TAKE DRUGS.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.233
I DON'T WANT TO SAY NO ALCOHOL,

02:38.233 --> 02:45.000
BUT TAKE IT EASY ON THE ALCOHOL!

02:45.000 --> 02:46.100
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:46.100 --> 02:46.834
WHY ARE YOU WALKING BACK

02:46.834 --> 02:49.900
THE PLEDGE AS YOU GO?

02:49.900 --> 02:50.600
YOU WOULD BE A TERRIBLE WEDDING

02:50.600 --> 02:51.100
OFFICIANT.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.133
"DO YOU TAKE THIS WOMAN --

02:52.133 --> 02:52.567
I DON'T WANT TO SAY

02:52.567 --> 02:53.100
'FORSAKING ALL OTHERS.'

02:53.100 --> 02:54.633
THERE ARE GOING TO BE OTHERS.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.033
BUT TAKE IT EASY ON THE OTHERS.

02:56.033 --> 02:57.133
AND DON'T LET THEM CALL YOU

02:57.133 --> 02:59.967
AT HOME."

02:59.967 --> 03:01.200
STILL, IT IS GOOD THAT THE

03:01.200 --> 03:01.800
PRESIDENT IS CALLING ATTENTION

03:01.800 --> 03:03.200
TO THE OPIOID CRISIS.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.233
THE PROBLEM IS, ATTENTION IS

03:05.233 --> 03:06.333
PRETTY MUCH ALL HE'S GIVING IT.

03:06.333 --> 03:07.633
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T PUT OUT

03:07.633 --> 03:08.700
A DETAILED STRATEGY,

03:08.700 --> 03:09.667
AND HIS SPLASHIEST STEP --

03:09.667 --> 03:10.800
DECLARING IT

03:10.800 --> 03:12.400
A "PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY" --

03:12.400 --> 03:14.367
DOESN'T ACTUALLY DO VERY MUCH.

03:14.367 --> 03:15.500
>> IT WILL STREAMLINE SOME

03:15.500 --> 03:18.066
ACCESS TO ADDICTION TREATMENT,

03:18.066 --> 03:20.200
BUT PROVIDES FEW NEW RESOURCES.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.633
FINANCING COMES FROM THE PUBLIC

03:21.633 --> 03:23.867
HEALTH EMERGENCY FUND, WHICH HAS

03:23.867 --> 03:27.600
A BALANCE OF JUST OVER $56,000.

03:27.600 --> 03:29.633
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ESTIMATES

03:29.633 --> 03:31.834
THE CRISIS COSTS $75 BILLION

03:31.834 --> 03:36.433
ANNUALLY.

03:36.433 --> 03:37.266
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

03:37.266 --> 03:37.834
TRUMP HAS FINALLY CHIMED IN

03:37.834 --> 03:38.400
WITH HIS TWO CENTS ABOUT HOW

03:38.400 --> 03:39.133
TO TACKLE THIS CRISIS, AND IT

03:39.133 --> 03:40.467
INVOLVES ALLOTTING, FOR THE

03:40.467 --> 03:41.233
2.6 MILLION AMERICANS ADDICTED

03:41.233 --> 03:43.333
TO OPIOIDS, LITERALLY

03:43.333 --> 03:45.400
ABOUT TWO CENTS EACH.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.800
SO TRUMP'S FIX FOR OUR OPIOIDS

03:46.800 --> 03:48.233
EPIDEMIC ESSENTIALLY BOILS DOWN

03:48.233 --> 03:50.166
TO, "HERE'S TWO PENNIES.

03:50.166 --> 03:52.166
GO THROW THEM IN A MALL FOUNTAIN

03:52.166 --> 03:55.200
AND WISH YOUR ADDICTION AWAY."

03:55.200 --> 03:56.533
BUT FOR NOW, LET'S TURN TO

03:56.533 --> 03:57.567
ALABAMA, THE SOUTH'S

03:57.567 --> 04:00.467
"THE SOUTH."

04:00.467 --> 04:01.900
ON DECEMBER 12TH, THEY'RE

04:01.900 --> 04:03.300
HOLDING A SPECIAL ELECTION

04:03.300 --> 04:04.500
FOR THE SENATE SEAT LEFT OPEN BY

04:04.500 --> 04:05.567
CURRENT ATTORNEY GENERAL

04:05.567 --> 04:07.533
JEFF SESSIONS, A POSITION

04:07.533 --> 04:08.633
I ASSUME HE WILL BE LEAVING

04:08.633 --> 04:09.700
ANY DAY NOW FOR HIS REGULAR

04:09.700 --> 04:12.934
HOLIDAY JOB.

04:12.934 --> 04:14.000
THIS SPECIAL ELECTION HAS GOTTEN

04:14.000 --> 04:14.767
A LOT OF BUZZ, BECAUSE

04:14.767 --> 04:15.967
THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE

04:15.967 --> 04:17.300
AND FRONTRUNNER IS FORMER

04:17.300 --> 04:18.834
ALABAMA SUPREME COURT CHIEF

04:18.834 --> 04:21.100
JUSTICE ROY MOORE.

04:21.100 --> 04:22.900
AND HE IS A LOT.

04:22.900 --> 04:24.000
>> HE'S CALLED AMERICAN INDIANS

04:24.000 --> 04:25.433
"REDS" AND ASIAN AMERICANS

04:25.433 --> 04:26.767
"YELLOWS."

04:26.767 --> 04:27.467
HE'S CALLED ISLAM

04:27.467 --> 04:29.300
A FALSE RELIGION.

04:29.300 --> 04:30.533
HE'S SAID HOMOSEXUAL ACTIVITY

04:30.533 --> 04:32.734
SHOULD BE ILLEGAL.

04:32.734 --> 04:34.000
HE REPORTEDLY SAID IN FEBRUARY

04:34.000 --> 04:36.100
THAT THE 9/11 ATTACKS MIGHT HAVE

04:36.100 --> 04:37.667
BEEN PUNISHMENT FOR AMERICA'S

04:37.667 --> 04:40.000
TURNING AWAY FROM GOD.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.600
AND ON MONDAY, HE CAUSED A STIR

04:41.600 --> 04:43.467
BY WAVING A GUN...

04:43.467 --> 04:44.166
>> I BELIEVE IN THE SECOND

04:44.166 --> 04:45.934
AMENDMENT.

04:45.934 --> 04:47.934
>> DURING A CAMPAIGN RALLY.

04:47.934 --> 04:49.600
>> John: OH, AND THAT'S NOT ALL.

04:49.600 --> 04:50.734
HE PERSONALLY KICKED A PANDA

04:50.734 --> 04:53.367
IN THE BALLS AND ONCE CALLED

04:53.367 --> 04:56.233
TOM HANKS THE N-WORD.

04:56.233 --> 04:58.000
AND JUST IN CASE YOU THOUGHT

04:58.000 --> 04:59.667
HE COULDN'T GET WORSE,

04:59.667 --> 05:01.467
MOORE IS ALSO AN ASPIRING POET.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.867
JUST LISTEN TO HIM RECITE A POEM

05:02.867 --> 05:03.367
HE CALLS "AMERICA

05:03.367 --> 05:05.367
THE BEAUTIFUL."

05:05.367 --> 05:09.233
>> AMERICA, THE BEAUTIFUL,

05:09.233 --> 05:10.700
OR SO YOU USED TO BE.

05:10.700 --> 05:11.867
LAND OF THE PILGRIMS' PRIDE.

05:11.867 --> 05:12.533
I'M GLAD THEY'RE NOT HERE

05:12.533 --> 05:14.433
TO SEE.

05:14.433 --> 05:15.500
BABIES PILED IN DUMPSTERS,

05:15.500 --> 05:17.166
ABORTION ON DEMAND.

05:17.166 --> 05:19.200
OH, SWEET LAND OF LIBERTY,

05:19.200 --> 05:20.700
YOUR HOUSE IS ON THE SAND.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.333
>> John: OKAY, LOOK.

05:22.333 --> 05:23.300
I DON'T SUPPORT EVERYTHING

05:23.300 --> 05:24.633
ROY MOORE SAYS, BUT I THINK WE

05:24.633 --> 05:25.567
CAN ALL AGREE:

05:25.567 --> 05:27.667
THAT IS OBJECTIVELY GOOD POETRY.

05:27.667 --> 05:29.367
I WOULD GO SO FAR AS TO SAY

05:29.367 --> 05:30.533
THAT'S THE BEST USE OF DUMPSTER

05:30.533 --> 05:32.300
BABY IMAGERY SINCE

05:32.300 --> 05:34.066
ROBERT FROST'S FAMOUS "STOPPING

05:34.066 --> 05:35.066
BY A DUMPSTER FULL OF BABIES

05:35.066 --> 05:37.300
ON A SNOWY EVENING."

05:37.300 --> 05:38.333
"WHOSE BABIES THESE ARE,

05:38.333 --> 05:40.233
I THINK I KNOW.

05:40.233 --> 05:41.166
HIS BABIES ARE IN THE DUMPSTER,

05:41.166 --> 05:42.700
THOUGH.

05:42.700 --> 05:43.900
HE WILL NOT SEE ME STOPPING

05:43.900 --> 05:45.400
HERE, TO SAY

05:45.400 --> 05:46.834
'HOLY SHIT, THIS DUMPSTER

05:46.834 --> 05:50.133
IS FULL OF BABIES.'"

05:50.133 --> 05:51.100
AND SPEAKING OF POETIC,

05:51.100 --> 05:52.200
LISTEN TO ROY MOORE'S FEELINGS

05:52.200 --> 05:53.467
ON HOMOSEXUALITY.

05:53.467 --> 05:55.367
BECAUSE AS BAD AS YOU ASSUME

05:55.367 --> 05:56.567
THEY ARE, THEY'RE ACTUALLY

05:56.567 --> 05:57.900
WORSE.

05:57.900 --> 05:59.400
HE FAVORS CRIMINALIZING SODOMY,

05:59.400 --> 06:01.000
AND IF YOU ASK HIM ABOUT THAT,

06:01.000 --> 06:03.066
THINGS GET WEIRD FAST.

06:03.066 --> 06:03.767
>> SODOMY IS AGAINST THE LAWS OF

06:03.767 --> 06:05.300
NATURE.

06:05.300 --> 06:06.600
OKAY, LET'S TAKE ANOTHER ONE.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.400
IS THERE A RIGHT IN THE

06:07.400 --> 06:11.500
CONSTITUTION FOR BESTIALITY?

06:11.500 --> 06:13.233
>> LOOK, YOU'RE ASKING...

06:13.233 --> 06:14.133
>> THERE IS NO RIGHT IN THE

06:14.133 --> 06:14.900
CONSTITUTION TO COMMIT

06:14.900 --> 06:17.000
BESTIALITY.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.567
THERE'S NOTHING THAT SAYS A MAN

06:18.567 --> 06:20.567
CAN HAVE SEX WITH A DONKEY

06:20.567 --> 06:21.367
OR A WOMAN CAN HAVE SEX

06:21.367 --> 06:23.800
WITH A DONKEY, RIGHT?

06:23.800 --> 06:26.533
IT'S NOT IN THERE.

06:26.533 --> 06:27.533
>> John: OKAY, SAY WHAT YOU WILL

06:27.533 --> 06:29.200
ABOUT ROY MOORE, HE'S A MAN

06:29.200 --> 06:30.767
WHO BELIEVES THAT A WOMAN CAN

06:30.767 --> 06:32.100
FUCK A DONKEY EVERY BIT AS WELL

06:32.100 --> 06:32.934
AS A MAN.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.633
AND THAT'S SOMETHING.

06:35.633 --> 06:35.934
#TapThatAss.

06:35.934 --> 06:39.433
#Feminism.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.800
MOORE HAS ALSO STOKED FEAR

06:41.800 --> 06:43.266
OF MUSLIMS, EVEN ONCE SUGGESTING

06:43.266 --> 06:44.333
THAT KEITH ELLISON'S FAITH

06:44.333 --> 06:45.133
SHOULD PREVENT HIM FROM SERVING

06:45.133 --> 06:46.767
IN CONGRESS.

06:46.767 --> 06:47.967
NOW LUCKILY, DUE TO EVERYTHING

06:47.967 --> 06:49.767
YOU'VE SEEN, REPUBLICANS IN BOTH

06:49.767 --> 06:51.100
THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE HAVE

06:51.100 --> 06:52.600
ROUNDLY CONDEMNED MOORE AND HIS

06:52.600 --> 06:53.266
VIEWS AND HAVE EVEN GONE SO FAR

06:53.266 --> 06:56.934
AS TO --

06:56.934 --> 06:57.700
I'M OBVIOUSLY KIDDING!

06:57.700 --> 06:58.300
HE JUST ENTERED INTO

06:58.300 --> 06:59.000
A FUNDRAISING AGREEMENT WITH THE

06:59.000 --> 06:59.967
RNC AND MULTIPLE REPUBLICAN

06:59.967 --> 07:01.467
SENATORS ARE ACTIVELY

07:01.467 --> 07:02.867
FUNDRAISING ON HIS BEHALF.

07:02.867 --> 07:04.300
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING

07:04.300 --> 07:05.300
WHY THEY'D DO THAT, I'LL LET

07:05.300 --> 07:05.967
TEXAS SENATOR JOHN CORNYN

07:05.967 --> 07:07.033
EXPLAIN.

07:07.133 --> 07:22.433
>> John: BUT THAT KIND OF BLIND

07:27.967 --> 07:33.133
LOYALTY MEANS THERE'S NOBODY

07:33.133 --> 07:34.033
YOU WOULD NOT SUPPORT.

07:34.033 --> 07:34.667
IF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

07:34.667 --> 07:35.300
NOMINATED A SWARM OF

07:35.300 --> 07:35.967
SMALLPOX-INFECTED BEES,

07:35.967 --> 07:37.266
PRESUMABLY JOHN CORNYN WOULD

07:37.266 --> 07:39.667
SAY, "LOOK, WE DISAGREE ON A LOT

07:39.667 --> 07:41.600
OF THINGS, BUT SENATOR, ALL

07:41.600 --> 07:42.367
THOSE BEES IS A RELIABLE VOTE

07:42.367 --> 07:43.133
ON TAX CUTS.

07:43.133 --> 07:43.934
I SUPPORT THE NOMINEE

07:43.934 --> 07:45.200
OF MY PARTY."

07:45.200 --> 07:46.934
AND EVEN THE REPUBLICAN SENATORS

07:46.934 --> 07:48.333
WHO AREN'T PUBLICLY SUPPORTING

07:48.333 --> 07:50.000
MOORE ARE HARDLY CONDEMNING HIM.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.133
HERE ARE A FEW OF THEIR

07:51.133 --> 07:52.000
REACTIONS AFTER BEING ASKED

07:52.000 --> 07:54.266
TO COMMENT ON HIS CAMPAIGN.

07:54.266 --> 07:55.667
>> SENATOR DEAN HELLER

07:55.667 --> 07:56.633
OF NEVADA, "WHO WON?

07:56.633 --> 08:00.433
I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION.

08:00.433 --> 08:01.500
I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT TAXES."

08:01.500 --> 08:02.934
SENATOR ROB PORTMAN OF OHIO,

08:02.934 --> 08:04.433
"HE'S GOING TO BE FOR TAX

08:04.433 --> 08:04.967
REFORM, I THINK.

08:04.967 --> 08:07.467
I DON'T KNOW.

08:07.467 --> 08:08.100
I DON'T KNOW HIM."

08:08.100 --> 08:09.934
SENATOR TIM SCOTT OF

08:09.934 --> 08:11.400
SOUTH CAROLINA, "I'M NOT GOING

08:11.400 --> 08:12.433
TO COMMENT ABOUT ANYTHING I

08:12.433 --> 08:13.066
HAVEN'T READ ABOUT.

08:13.066 --> 08:14.300
I LITERALLY HAVE NOT FOLLOWED

08:14.300 --> 08:15.000
THAT RACE."

08:15.000 --> 08:15.600
>> John: "I HAVEN'T FOLLOWED

08:15.600 --> 08:15.867
THAT ONE"?

08:15.867 --> 08:16.800
COME ON.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.066
THIS IS YOUR OWN PARTY'S SENATE

08:18.066 --> 08:19.800
CANDIDATE, NOT "RAY DONOVAN."

08:19.800 --> 08:20.533
"I HAVEN'T BEEN FOLLOWING

08:20.533 --> 08:21.533
THAT ONE.

08:21.533 --> 08:22.800
WHAT IS HIS CHARACTER?

08:22.800 --> 08:23.900
THE POSTER GIVES ME NOTHING!

08:23.900 --> 08:25.433
IS HE AN ASSASSIN?

08:25.433 --> 08:27.567
A SOMMELIER?

08:27.567 --> 08:28.567
AN UNCLE SHOWING UP DRUNK

08:28.567 --> 08:29.533
AT A CHRISTENING?

08:29.533 --> 08:30.600
IS HE A MEMBER OF THE WAHLBERG

08:30.600 --> 08:31.200
FAMILY?

08:31.200 --> 08:38.300
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW."

08:38.300 --> 08:39.367
AND IF ANY OF THAT HAS MADE YOU

08:39.367 --> 08:40.667
FEEL SAD ABOUT THE STATE OF OUR

08:40.667 --> 08:41.200
DEMOCRACY, SPARE A THOUGHT

08:41.200 --> 08:44.934
FOR AUSTRALIA,

08:44.934 --> 08:45.667
NOT IN FACT THE BIRTHPLACE

08:45.667 --> 08:46.467
OF OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE BUT YET

08:46.467 --> 08:47.266
VERY MUCH THE OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE

08:47.266 --> 08:49.934
OF COUNTRIES.

08:49.934 --> 08:50.934
AUSTRALIA IS CURRENTLY IN THE

08:50.934 --> 08:51.767
MIDST OF A MAJOR VOTE

08:51.767 --> 08:53.200
OF ITS OWN.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.700
>> AT THE MOMENT, 16 MILLION

08:54.700 --> 08:56.033
AUSTRALIANS ARE BEING ASKED

08:56.033 --> 08:57.133
TO VOTE IN A POSTAL SURVEY

08:57.133 --> 09:02.600
ON SAME SEX MARRIAGE.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.200
>> John: IT'S TRUE,

09:04.200 --> 09:05.300
THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT IS

09:05.300 --> 09:06.600
CONDUCTING A POSTAL SURVEY ON

09:06.600 --> 09:07.367
WHETHER SAME-SEX MARRIAGE SHOULD

09:07.367 --> 09:08.100
BE LEGAL, WHICH IS AN ODD THING

09:08.100 --> 09:08.934
TO DO.

09:08.934 --> 09:09.900
BECAUSE POLLS ALREADY EXIST

09:09.900 --> 09:10.567
SHOWING AROUND TWO-THIRDS

09:10.567 --> 09:11.100
OF AUSTRALIANS SUPPORT IT.

09:11.100 --> 09:11.633
SO PARLIAMENT COULD SIMPLY

09:11.633 --> 09:12.367
PASS IT INTO LAW.

09:12.367 --> 09:13.033
BUT INSTEAD,

09:13.033 --> 09:13.934
THEY'RE INEXPLICABLY HOLDING

09:13.934 --> 09:15.800
A NON-LEGALLY BINDING, VOLUNTARY

09:15.800 --> 09:17.567
POSTAL VOTE AT A PUBLIC COST

09:17.567 --> 09:19.967
OF $120 MILLION, WHICH IS THE

09:19.967 --> 09:21.667
WEIRDEST WASTE OF AUSTRALIAN

09:21.667 --> 09:23.166
MONEY SINCE EVERY

09:23.166 --> 09:26.333
BAZ LUHRMAN MOVIE EVER MADE.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.667
THE BALLOTS ARE DUE BY

09:27.667 --> 09:29.533
NOVEMBER 7TH, AND THE CAMPAIGN

09:29.533 --> 09:30.367
HAS BEEN TRULY TOXIC,

09:30.367 --> 09:32.233
WITH MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT

09:32.233 --> 09:33.600
DELIVERING RIDICULOUS ARGUMENTS

09:33.600 --> 09:34.400
AGAINST MARRIAGE EQUALITY

09:34.400 --> 09:35.834
LIKE THIS.

09:35.834 --> 09:36.667
>> THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF

09:36.667 --> 09:37.767
AFFECTIONATE RELATIONSHIPS.

09:37.767 --> 09:38.667
I HAVE AN AFFECTIONATE

09:38.667 --> 09:40.800
RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU, SAM.

09:40.800 --> 09:41.800
>> WE'RE NOT MARRIED.

09:41.800 --> 09:42.300
>> NO, THAT'S RIGHT.

09:42.300 --> 09:44.567
WE'RE NOT MARRIED.

09:44.567 --> 09:45.900
>> YOU HAVE A VERY LOVELY WIFE.

09:45.900 --> 09:47.000
>> I HAVE AN AFFECTIONATE

09:47.000 --> 09:48.400
RELATIONSHIP WITH MY CYCLING

09:48.400 --> 09:49.500
MATES, WHO WE GO CYCLING

09:49.500 --> 09:50.800
ON THE WEEKENDS,

09:50.800 --> 09:53.200
BUT THAT'S NOT MARRIAGE.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.500
>> John: "I MEAN, WE DO FUCK.

09:55.500 --> 09:57.166
WE FINISH CYCLING AND WE SLOWLY

09:57.166 --> 09:58.567
PEEL OUR CYCLING CLOTHES OFF

09:58.567 --> 09:59.867
BY THE SIDE OF A BUCOLIC COUNTRY

09:59.867 --> 10:01.100
ROAD AND WE FUCK.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.233
BUT THAT'S NOT MARRIAGE.

10:02.233 --> 10:02.834
THAT'S FUCKING

10:02.834 --> 10:08.467
YOUR CYCLING MATES."

10:08.467 --> 10:12.767
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

10:12.767 --> 10:18.000
YOUR CYCLING MATES.

10:18.000 --> 10:18.600
USE CYCLE.

10:18.600 --> 10:19.233
YOU FUCK.

10:19.233 --> 10:22.133
THAT'S NOT MARRIAGE.

10:22.133 --> 10:22.834
AND HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE

10:22.834 --> 10:23.433
HUNG UP ON SEMANTICS.

10:23.433 --> 10:24.066
ONE ACTIVIST SEEMED UNUSUALLY

10:24.066 --> 10:24.600
OBSESSED WITH TERMINOLOGY.

10:24.600 --> 10:25.100
>> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

10:25.100 --> 10:25.867
IF I MAY STILL USE THAT TERM

10:25.867 --> 10:27.900
IN THESE GENDER-FLUID TIMES.

10:27.900 --> 10:29.800
I SPEAK FOR MARRIAGE.

10:29.800 --> 10:30.800
>> SPEAKING AGAINST SAME-SEX

10:30.800 --> 10:34.400
MARRIAGE IS SOPHIE YORK FROM THE

10:34.400 --> 10:35.633
LOBBY GROUP MARRIAGE ALLIANCE,

10:35.633 --> 10:36.300
WHICH SAYS UNIONS OF SAME-SEX

10:36.300 --> 10:37.433
COUPLES SHOULDN'T EVEN BE

10:37.433 --> 10:39.100
CALLED MARRIAGE.

10:39.100 --> 10:40.834
>> I THINK THAT THE IDEA OF

10:40.834 --> 10:42.734
HAVING A DIFFERENT WORD HAS BEEN

10:42.734 --> 10:44.100
FLOATED, AND I'M SURE IT STILL

10:44.100 --> 10:46.633
WILL BE AND SOMEONE ELSE PUT

10:46.633 --> 10:48.934
FORTH THE WORD "GARRIAGE"

10:48.934 --> 10:52.133
AS A -- AS A POSSIBILITY.

10:52.133 --> 10:53.934
>> John: "GARRIAGE."

10:53.934 --> 10:56.133
THAT IS A STUPID WORD,

10:56.133 --> 10:57.600
EXCEPT IN THE RARE CASE OF

10:57.600 --> 10:58.433
A WEDDING BETWEEN TWO MEN

10:58.433 --> 11:00.400
NAMED GARY, IN WHICH CASE, YES,

11:00.400 --> 11:01.367
OBVIOUSLY, THEY SHOULD BE

11:01.367 --> 11:03.834
GETTING GARRIED.

11:03.834 --> 11:05.567
AND LOOK, AS STUPID AS THAT IS,

11:05.567 --> 11:06.200
IT'S THE SORT OF ARGUMENT

11:06.200 --> 11:07.433
YOU'D EXPECT.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.266
BUT THE "NO" CAMPAIGN HAS ALSO

11:09.266 --> 11:09.867
HAD SOME SURPRISING MEMBERS,

11:09.867 --> 11:11.667
LIKE THIS COUPLE.

11:11.667 --> 11:13.033
>> I USED TO BE A SUPPORTER

11:13.033 --> 11:14.667
OF SAME-SEX MARRIAGE.

11:14.667 --> 11:15.867
I MEAN, I PROPOSED TO BEN

11:15.867 --> 11:17.934
FIVE YEARS AGO.

11:17.934 --> 11:19.100
>> I JUST EXPLAINED TO HIM.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.400
I SAID, "I DON'T THINK

11:21.400 --> 11:24.000
IT'S MY CUP OF TEA."

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
>> EVEN IF SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IS

11:25.000 --> 11:26.600
LEGALIZED, MARK AND BEN WON'T BE

11:26.600 --> 11:29.166
WALKING DOWN THE AISLE.

11:29.166 --> 11:31.033
>> IF IT'S YES, WE'LL BE LIKE,

11:31.033 --> 11:31.333
OKAY, THEN.

11:31.333 --> 11:32.567
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

11:32.567 --> 11:33.100
EVERYONE CAN GET MARRIED.

11:33.100 --> 11:34.500
BUT WE PERSONALLY WILL NOT BE

11:34.500 --> 11:35.467
GETTING MARRIED.

11:35.467 --> 11:36.266
WE'LL STAND BY OUR COMMITMENT

11:36.266 --> 11:37.934
TO EACH OTHER.

11:37.934 --> 11:38.533
WE DON'T NEED MARRIAGE

11:38.533 --> 11:40.367
IN OUR LIVES.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.333
DEFINITELY NOT.

11:42.333 --> 11:43.500
>> John: WHOA.

11:43.500 --> 11:44.033
TWO THINGS.

11:44.033 --> 11:45.467
BEN?

11:45.467 --> 11:48.200
YOU ARE COLD BLOODED!

11:48.200 --> 11:49.567
AND MARK, YOU CAN DO SO MUCH

11:49.567 --> 11:51.033
BETTER THAN HIM.

11:51.033 --> 11:52.767
YOU DESERVE SOMEONE AS COMMITTED

11:52.767 --> 11:55.000
TO YOU AS YOU ARE TO THEM.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.166
YOU LISTEN TO ME, MARK.

11:56.166 --> 11:56.900
YOU LISTEN TO ME.

11:56.900 --> 11:57.433
THIS RELATIONSHIP IS GOING

11:57.433 --> 11:58.500
NOWHERE.

11:58.500 --> 11:59.300
DON'T STAY TOGETHER

11:59.300 --> 12:00.333
FOR THE DOG.

12:00.333 --> 12:02.400
HE KNOWS YOU'RE UNHAPPY TOO!

12:02.400 --> 12:03.633
YOU RESPECT YOURSELF, MARK.

12:03.633 --> 12:04.867
AND YOU LEAVE.

12:04.867 --> 12:06.133
GET YOURSELF ON AUSTRALIAN

12:06.133 --> 12:07.767
GRINDR AND YOU SWIPE IN,

12:07.767 --> 12:09.033
I'M PRESUMING, THE OPPOSITE

12:09.033 --> 12:11.734
DIRECTION THAN WE DO.

12:11.734 --> 12:13.367
IN FACT, THIS WHOLE DEBATE GOT

12:13.367 --> 12:14.767
SO HEATED OVER THE PAST FEW

12:14.767 --> 12:16.900
MONTHS, IT EVEN SPILLED OVER

12:16.900 --> 12:18.100
INTO AUSTRALIAN RUGBY'S VERSION

12:18.100 --> 12:19.967
OF THE SUPER BOWL.

12:19.967 --> 12:21.033
>> AN ONLINE PETITION IS CALLING

12:21.033 --> 12:22.934
ON THE LEAGUE TO STOP AMERICAN

12:22.934 --> 12:25.133
RAPPER MACKLEMORE FROM

12:25.133 --> 12:26.600
PERFORMING HIS GAY RIGHTS SONG

12:26.600 --> 12:28.100
"SAME LOVE" AS PART OF SUNDAY'S

12:28.100 --> 12:30.734
GRAND FINAL ENTERTAINMENT.

12:30.734 --> 12:32.133
>> John: OKAY, THAT IS PUTTING

12:32.133 --> 12:34.433
ME IN A TOUGH POSITION.

12:34.433 --> 12:35.734
BECAUSE I SUPPORT GAY MARRIAGE,

12:35.734 --> 12:37.467
BUT I REFUSE TO EVER SAY,

12:37.467 --> 12:40.900
"LET MACKLEMORE PERFORM!"

12:40.900 --> 12:42.500
HIS MUSIC BELONGS IN ONE PLACE

12:42.500 --> 12:43.734
AND ONE PLACE ONLY, AND THAT'S

12:43.734 --> 12:50.000
THE PANDORA STATION

12:50.000 --> 12:51.667
"NOW THAT IS WHAT YOUR MOM CALLS

12:51.667 --> 12:53.467
RAP MUSIC."

12:53.467 --> 12:54.400
ALSO, LET'S NOT PRETEND THAT

12:54.400 --> 12:55.033
AUSTRALIA HAS RELENTLESSLY HIGH

12:55.033 --> 12:55.567
STANDARDS OF WHO PERFORMS

12:55.567 --> 12:56.467
AT THEIR SPORTING EVENTS.

12:56.467 --> 12:57.934
NOT AFTER THIS MEMORABLE

12:57.934 --> 12:59.367
PERFORMANCE AT THE 2011

12:59.367 --> 13:04.367
AFL GRAND FINAL.

BUDDY HOLLY, RICHIE VALENS,

13:35.900 --> 13:37.333
AND THE BIG BOPPER.

13:37.333 --> 13:38.533
THERE'S A NEW "DAY THE MUSIC

13:38.533 --> 13:41.300
DIED" IN TOWN.

13:41.300 --> 13:42.600
AND FIGHTING THE DEBATE WITH

13:42.600 --> 13:43.667
WORDS AND SONGS IS ONE THING.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.367
BUT IN SOME CASES IT'S ACTUALLY

13:45.367 --> 13:46.433
GOT PHYSICAL.

13:46.433 --> 13:47.567
THE PRO-GAY MARRIAGE

13:47.567 --> 13:48.266
HEAD OF QANTAS GOT PIED

13:48.266 --> 13:50.033
IN THE FACE, WHILE THE ANTI-GAY

13:50.033 --> 13:51.166
MARRIAGE FORMER PRIME MINISTER

13:51.166 --> 13:53.934
TONY ABBOTT, A MAN WHOSE SMILE

13:53.934 --> 13:55.166
SAYS, "SMELL THAT?

13:55.166 --> 13:58.800
I JUST CUT ONE" --

13:58.800 --> 13:59.967
HE HAD AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT

13:59.967 --> 14:00.700
WHEN HE WAS WALKING DOWN THE

14:00.700 --> 14:01.333
STREET.

14:01.333 --> 14:03.166
>> A GENTLEMAN SANG OUT

14:03.166 --> 14:04.633
"HEY, TONY."

14:04.633 --> 14:05.300
I TURNED AROUND.

14:05.300 --> 14:06.000
HE SAID, "I WANT TO SHAKE

14:06.000 --> 14:10.700
YOUR HAND."

14:10.700 --> 14:12.900
I SAW HIM COMING TOWARDS ME.

14:12.900 --> 14:14.066
I HELD OUT MY HAND.

14:14.066 --> 14:15.433
HE GRABBED MY HAND.

14:15.433 --> 14:17.433
AND IT TURNED INTO A HEAD-BUTT.

14:17.433 --> 14:18.567
>> John: IT'S TRUE.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.834
TONY ABBOTT WAS HEAD-BUTTED BY

14:20.834 --> 14:24.734
THIS MAN, A TASMANIAN ANARCHIST

14:24.734 --> 14:26.533
WHO GOES BY THE NAMES

14:26.533 --> 14:28.266
"ASTRO LABE," AND, EVEN BETTER,

14:28.266 --> 14:30.934
"DJ FUNKNUKL."

14:30.934 --> 14:31.600
ALTHOUGH IT TURNS OUT THAT

14:31.600 --> 14:33.700
ACCORDING TO DJ FUNKNUKL

14:33.700 --> 14:35.266
THE ATTACK ACTUALLY WAS NOT

14:35.266 --> 14:35.900
CONNECTED WITH THE GAY MARRIAGE

14:35.900 --> 14:37.967
ISSUE AT ALL.

14:37.967 --> 14:39.000
>> HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO

14:39.000 --> 14:40.400
WITH MARRIAGE EQUALITY.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.633
THAT WAS JUST COINCIDENTAL THAT

14:41.633 --> 14:42.433
SOMEONE HAD STUCK A STICKER

14:42.433 --> 14:43.567
ON MY JACKET.

14:43.567 --> 14:44.667
I WAS THINKING,

14:44.667 --> 14:46.200
"THERE'S TONY ABBOTT.

14:46.200 --> 14:55.633
I'M GOING TO HEAD-BUTT HIM."

14:55.633 --> 14:56.734
>> John: SO HERE'S THE IMPORTANT

14:56.734 --> 14:57.266
THING.

14:57.266 --> 14:57.734
I AM IN NO WAY

14:57.734 --> 14:58.200
CONDONING TONY ABBOTT

14:58.200 --> 14:58.734
BEING ATTACKED.

14:58.734 --> 14:59.467
WHAT I WILL SAY IS, THINKING

14:59.467 --> 14:59.934
TO YOURSELF,

14:59.934 --> 15:00.400
"THERE'S TONY ABBOTT.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.133
I'M GOING TO HEAD-BUTT HIM,"

15:01.133 --> 15:03.200
IS ENTIRELY NATURAL.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.433
IT'S AN AUTOMATIC HUMAN

15:05.433 --> 15:06.567
RESPONSE, LIKE "THERE'S A PUPPY.

15:06.567 --> 15:07.967
I'M GOING TO PET IT."

15:07.967 --> 15:09.033
OR "THERE'S SEAN PENN.

15:09.033 --> 15:09.867
I'M NOT GOING TO SEE

15:09.867 --> 15:13.400
THAT MOVIE."

15:13.400 --> 15:14.900
SO THIS HAS BEEN A DISPIRITING,

15:14.900 --> 15:19.900
ULTIMATELY POINTLESS PROCESS,

15:19.900 --> 15:20.567
AND I THINK THERE

15:20.567 --> 15:21.133
ARE ONLY TWO GOOD THINGS

15:21.133 --> 15:22.633
THAT COULD COME OUT OF IT.

15:22.633 --> 15:23.300
ONE IS IF AUSTRALIA'S PARLIAMENT

15:23.300 --> 15:23.767
LEGALIZES GAY MARRIAGE

15:23.767 --> 15:25.100
AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY.

15:25.100 --> 15:26.500
AND TWO, THAT MARK HEEDS MY

15:26.500 --> 15:28.867
WORDS, PUTS HIMSELF OUT THERE,

15:28.867 --> 15:29.633
AND MEETS SOMEONE WHO DESERVES

15:29.633 --> 15:30.900
HIM.

15:30.900 --> 15:31.934
BECAUSE, MARK, YOU CAN FIND

15:31.934 --> 15:33.300
SOMEONE WHO WOULD DO ANYTHING

15:33.300 --> 15:37.633
FOR LOVE, INCLUDING THAT.

15:37.633 --> 15:50.934
AND NOW THIS.

15:50.934 --> 16:00.033
>> ♪ AMERICA, GOD SHED HIS

16:00.033 --> 16:07.400
GRACE ON THEE ♪

16:07.400 --> 16:17.767
♪ FROM SEA TO SHINING SEA ♪

16:17.767 --> 16:18.967
>> John: MOVING ON.

16:18.967 --> 16:19.600
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

16:19.600 --> 16:20.367
FLOODS.

16:20.367 --> 16:21.300
THEY'RE CLEARLY CATASTROPHIC,

16:21.300 --> 16:22.967
TRAUMATIC EVENTS.

16:22.967 --> 16:24.166
ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN

16:24.166 --> 16:25.200
RESPONSIBLE FOR ONE OF THE MOST

16:25.200 --> 16:26.600
MEMORABLE CLIPS IN THE HISTORY

16:26.600 --> 16:28.600
OF BROADCAST NEWS.

16:28.600 --> 16:29.633
>> GOOD MORNING.

16:29.633 --> 16:30.600
WELL, OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GETTING

16:30.600 --> 16:31.633
A NICE BREAK FROM THE RAIN,

16:31.633 --> 16:33.767
BUT NOT THE FLOODING.

16:33.767 --> 16:36.066
THIS ESSENTIALLY NOW A PART OF

16:36.066 --> 16:36.900
THE PASSAIC RIVER IN THIS

16:36.900 --> 16:40.767
NEIGHBORHOOD.

16:40.767 --> 16:41.467
>> John: THAT'S IT,

16:41.467 --> 16:42.033
FUCK JAMES CAMERON.

16:42.033 --> 16:43.166
AND FUCK "TITANIC."

16:43.166 --> 16:44.266
BECAUSE THAT IS NOW OFFICIALLY

16:44.266 --> 16:44.867
THE GREATEST BOAT DISASTER

16:44.867 --> 16:48.300
EVER CAPTURED ON FILM.

16:48.300 --> 16:49.533
IT'S OVER.

16:49.533 --> 16:50.000
FLOODS WERE EVERYWHERE

16:50.000 --> 16:51.300
THIS SUMMER.

16:51.300 --> 16:52.266
THINK OF THEM AS THE "DESPACITO"

16:52.266 --> 16:54.367
OF NATURAL DISASTERS:

16:54.367 --> 16:55.700
PERSISTENT, UBIQUITOUS,

16:55.700 --> 16:56.800
AND ABSOLUTELY NO FAULT OF THE

16:56.800 --> 16:58.467
PUERTO RICAN GOVERNMENT.

16:58.467 --> 16:59.166
AND FLOODS ARE ALWAYS

16:59.166 --> 17:00.333
THREATENING.

17:00.333 --> 17:02.033
90% OF ALL NATURAL DISASTERS

17:02.033 --> 17:04.000
IN THE U.S. INVOLVE A FLOOD,

17:04.000 --> 17:05.467
WHICH IS, I ASSUME, THE REASON

17:05.467 --> 17:06.400
FEMA'S WEBSITE ONCE REFERRED

17:06.400 --> 17:07.900
TO FLOODING AS "AMERICA'S

17:07.900 --> 17:11.500
NUMBER ONE NATURAL HAZARD!"

17:11.500 --> 17:12.567
WHICH IS A PRETTY WEIRD TONE

17:12.567 --> 17:13.467
TO TAKE WHEN DESCRIBING

17:13.467 --> 17:14.667
SOMETHING HORRIBLE.

17:14.667 --> 17:15.567
IT'S LIKE SAYING,

17:15.567 --> 17:16.800
"BOILS: AMERICA'S NUMBER ONE

17:16.800 --> 17:18.900
STAPH INFECTION!"

17:18.900 --> 17:20.500
OR "PARKS: AMERICA'S NUMBER ONE

17:20.500 --> 17:23.200
PLACE TO DIE UNNOTICED!"

17:23.200 --> 17:25.000
AND FLOODS ARE ONLY GOING TO GET

17:25.000 --> 17:25.934
WORSE DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

17:25.934 --> 17:27.300
AND I KNOW THERE ARE PEOPLE

17:27.300 --> 17:28.533
WHO'LL DISPUTE THAT, AND WE JUST

17:28.533 --> 17:31.000
DON'T HAVE TIME TO LITIGATE

17:31.000 --> 17:32.367
WHETHER EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS

17:32.367 --> 17:33.400
ARE EXACERBATED BY CLIMATE

17:33.400 --> 17:35.300
CHANGE, SO FOR NOW,

17:35.300 --> 17:38.600
LET'S JUST SAY, YEAH,

17:38.600 --> 17:42.066
THEY DEFINITELY ARE.

17:42.066 --> 17:44.800
I MEAN, SURE, IT'S A COMPLICATED

17:44.800 --> 17:47.333
ISSUE, AND WE MIGHT NOT HAVE

17:47.333 --> 17:49.100
DEFINITIVE PROOF UNTIL THE LATE

17:49.100 --> 17:51.133
1980s.

17:51.133 --> 17:52.266
BUT WHILE FLOODS ARE OFTEN

17:52.266 --> 17:53.367
REFERRED TO AS NATURAL

17:53.367 --> 17:55.266
DISASTERS, THE TRUTH IS,

17:55.266 --> 17:56.133
THE DAMAGE THEY DO IS OFTEN,

17:56.133 --> 17:57.266
TO SOME EXTENT, WITHIN OUR

17:57.266 --> 17:58.767
CONTROL BECAUSE WE HAVE MADE

17:58.767 --> 18:00.000
CERTAIN DECISIONS THAT PUT

18:00.000 --> 18:01.367
AND KEEP PEOPLE AND PROPERTY

18:01.367 --> 18:03.300
IN THE PATH OF FLOODING.

18:03.300 --> 18:04.300
AND THAT IS WHAT THIS STORY

18:04.300 --> 18:05.600
IS ABOUT.

18:05.600 --> 18:07.166
AND BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER,

18:07.166 --> 18:07.900
LET'S ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PEOPLE

18:07.900 --> 18:08.934
LIVE NEAR WATER FOR ALL SORTS

18:08.934 --> 18:09.967
OF REASONS.

18:09.967 --> 18:10.900
FOR SOME, IT'S WHERE THEIR

18:10.900 --> 18:11.567
FAMILIES HAVE LIVED FOR

18:11.567 --> 18:13.000
GENERATIONS OR A NECESSITY

18:13.000 --> 18:14.266
FOR THE WORK THAT THEY DO.

18:14.266 --> 18:15.800
FOR OTHERS, IT'S A LUXURY,

18:15.800 --> 18:17.100
AND LIVING NEXT TO THE WATER IS

18:17.100 --> 18:19.000
UNDOUBTEDLY ATTRACTIVE, DESPITE

18:19.000 --> 18:21.667
RISKS LIKE FLOODING

18:21.667 --> 18:24.200
OR STEPPING ON POINTY SEASHELLS

18:24.200 --> 18:25.367
OR MISTAKENLY GIVING A TOSTITO

18:25.367 --> 18:26.700
TO A SEAGULL WITHOUT REALIZING

18:26.700 --> 18:28.333
THAT MEANS YOU'LL NOW SPEND

18:28.333 --> 18:30.133
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE HAUNTED BY

18:30.133 --> 18:32.233
A TOSTITO-ADDICTED SEAGULL.

18:32.233 --> 18:33.800
THE POINT IS, WHATEVER THE

18:33.800 --> 18:35.266
REASON TO LIVE BY THE WATER,

18:35.266 --> 18:40.300
MANY DO IT, AND ARE --

18:40.300 --> 18:41.700
FOR FUCK'S SAKE.

18:41.700 --> 18:42.467
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

18:42.467 --> 18:43.300
I DON'T HAVE ANY TOSTITOS!

18:43.300 --> 18:43.867
I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU THAT

18:43.867 --> 18:48.367
FOR SIX YEARS.

18:48.367 --> 18:49.667
LOOK, NO TOSTITOS!

18:49.667 --> 18:50.400
GET OUT OF HERE,

18:50.400 --> 18:53.200
YOU FLYING BEACH RAT!

18:53.200 --> 18:56.200
SORRY.

18:56.200 --> 18:57.934
THE POINT IS, THE DANGERS OF

18:57.934 --> 18:59.166
WATERFRONT LIVING ARE REAL.

18:59.166 --> 19:00.567
BUT MANY PEOPLE, LIKE THIS MAN

19:00.567 --> 19:02.633
WHO LIVES ON THE WATER

19:02.633 --> 19:04.400
IN TAMPA BAY, FEEL THE BENEFITS

19:04.400 --> 19:05.834
OUTWEIGH THE RISKS.

19:05.834 --> 19:06.767
>> MARK KNOWS THAT LIFE HERE

19:06.767 --> 19:08.166
IS TENUOUS.

19:08.166 --> 19:09.667
BUT HE DOESN'T DWELL ON IT.

19:09.667 --> 19:10.900
>> EVERY MORNING WHEN I WALK OUT

19:10.900 --> 19:13.166
TO GET THE PAPER, I SEE DOLPHINS

19:13.166 --> 19:14.734
FROLICKING IN THE BAYOU

19:14.734 --> 19:16.433
AND ROSEATE SPOONBILLS WALKING

19:16.433 --> 19:19.200
AROUND THE EDGE OF THE BAYOU,

19:19.200 --> 19:20.800
SO TENDS TO MAKE YOU FORGET

19:20.800 --> 19:22.467
ABOUT ALL THOSE SORTS OF THINGS.

19:22.467 --> 19:23.633
>> John: SURE, I CAN IMAGINE

19:23.633 --> 19:25.033
SEEING A ROSEATE SPOONBILL

19:25.033 --> 19:27.066
WOULD TAKE YOUR MIND OFF THINGS,

19:27.066 --> 19:27.867
BECAUSE YOU'RE SPENDING YOUR

19:27.867 --> 19:29.233
WHOLE DAY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

19:29.233 --> 19:30.767
HOW A FLAMINGO COULD HAVE GOTTEN

19:30.767 --> 19:31.433
ITS STUPID BIRD FACE STUCK

19:31.433 --> 19:33.800
INTO A PANINI PRESS.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.567
I'M JUST SAYING EVEN PEOPLE WHO

19:35.567 --> 19:38.133
LIKE BIRDS DON'T LIKE THIS BIRD.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.433
THE AUDUBON SOCIETY,

19:39.433 --> 19:41.266
AN ORGANIZATION WHOSE ENTIRE

19:41.266 --> 19:42.767
PURPOSE IS TO CHAMPION BIRDS,

19:42.767 --> 19:44.300
SAYS THEY'RE "GORGEOUS

19:44.300 --> 19:45.300
AT A DISTANCE AND BIZARRE

19:45.300 --> 19:47.667
UP CLOSE."

19:47.667 --> 19:48.433
WHICH IS LIKE THE AMERICAN

19:48.433 --> 19:49.734
KENNEL CLUB SAYING,

19:49.734 --> 19:51.200
"WE CELEBRATE ALL DOGS AND HONOR

19:51.200 --> 19:53.400
THEM AS MAN'S BEST FRIEND,

19:53.400 --> 19:54.767
BUT THE DANDIE DINMONT HAS A

19:54.767 --> 19:57.100
TRASH PERSONALITY AND LOOKS LIKE

19:57.100 --> 19:59.767
A SCOTTIE FUCKED PHIL SPECTOR."

19:59.767 --> 20:01.233
AND LOOK, IF YOU'RE LITERALLY

20:01.233 --> 20:02.400
OVERLOOKING A BAYOU, LIKE THAT

20:02.400 --> 20:03.934
GUY, YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE

20:03.934 --> 20:05.367
THAT FLOODING IS A RISK.

20:05.367 --> 20:08.400
BUT NOT EVERY FLOOD-PRONE AREA

20:08.400 --> 20:09.633
IS DIRECTLY ALONG THE COAST.

20:09.633 --> 20:10.800
AND SOMETIMES, AGGRESSIVE

20:10.800 --> 20:12.300
DEVELOPMENT CAN EXACERBATE

20:12.300 --> 20:13.533
THE RISK OF FLOODING,

20:13.533 --> 20:15.567
EVEN CONSIDERABLY INLAND.

20:15.567 --> 20:17.133
JUST LOOK AT HOUSTON, WHICH WAS

20:17.133 --> 20:18.967
RECENTLY ROCKED BY HARVEY.

20:18.967 --> 20:19.867
>> THE METRO AREA'S DEVELOPMENT

20:19.867 --> 20:21.467
HAS EXPLODED.

20:21.467 --> 20:22.934
ONE STUDY FOUND THE HOUSTON AREA

20:22.934 --> 20:25.433
HAS ADDED 25% MORE PAVEMENT OVER

20:25.433 --> 20:27.100
15 YEARS, REPLACING SOIL-RICH

20:27.100 --> 20:29.600
WETLANDS THAT COULD ABSORB WATER

20:29.600 --> 20:34.667
WITH CONCRETE-COVERED SUBURBIA.

20:34.667 --> 20:35.467
>> John: EXACTLY, AND THAT MADE

20:35.467 --> 20:36.066
HARVEY'S DAMAGE SIGNIFICANTLY

20:36.066 --> 20:36.567
WORSE.

20:36.567 --> 20:37.300
CONCRETE ISN'T GOOD

20:37.300 --> 20:39.033
AT ABSORBING WATER.

20:39.033 --> 20:40.233
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE DON'T DRY OFF

20:40.233 --> 20:41.700
AT THE BEACH BY ROLLING AROUND

20:41.700 --> 20:44.066
IN THE PARKING LOT.

20:44.066 --> 20:45.233
BUT IT'S NOT JUST GLOBAL WARMING

20:45.233 --> 20:46.867
OR UNCHECKED GROWTH THAT HAVE

20:46.867 --> 20:47.500
PUT MORE PEOPLE IN RISKY,

20:47.500 --> 20:49.433
FLOOD PRONE AREAS.

20:49.433 --> 20:50.633
IT'S ALSO THE FACT THAT IT'S

20:50.633 --> 20:51.700
FREQUENTLY ONLY POSSIBLE FOR

20:51.700 --> 20:53.433
PEOPLE TO TAKE THAT RISK BECAUSE

20:53.433 --> 20:55.033
THEY HAVE FLOOD INSURANCE.

20:55.033 --> 20:56.500
JUST LOOK AT "BUYING THE BEACH,"

20:56.500 --> 20:57.900
A "HOUSE HUNTERS" TYPE SHOW

20:57.900 --> 20:58.667
FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LIVE

20:58.667 --> 20:59.367
NEAR THE WATER.

20:59.367 --> 21:00.367
ONE EPISODE FEATURED

21:00.367 --> 21:01.533
TWO BROTHERS NAMED MITCH

21:01.533 --> 21:03.033
AND DANIEL ARGUING OVER

21:03.033 --> 21:04.600
A PARTICULAR BEACH HOUSE,

21:04.600 --> 21:07.300
LEADING TO THIS EXCHANGE.

21:07.300 --> 21:08.133
>> WHAT'D YOU THINK ABOUT

21:08.133 --> 21:09.367
THE ISLAND HOUSE, MITCH?

21:09.367 --> 21:10.600
>> WELL, I THINK THERE WAS A LOT

21:10.600 --> 21:12.967
OF GOOD AND A LOT OF BAD ON IT.

21:12.967 --> 21:13.433
RIGHT OFF THOSE STEPS

21:13.433 --> 21:13.800
INTO THE BEACH.

21:13.800 --> 21:17.600
CAN'T BE BEAT.

21:17.600 --> 21:18.633
>> REALLY CLOSE TO THE WATER.

21:18.633 --> 21:19.200
THAT'S JUST ANOTHER THING

21:19.200 --> 21:19.700
THAT'S GOT ME CONCERNED.

21:19.700 --> 21:20.300
>> WELL, THAT'S WHAT INSURANCE

21:20.300 --> 21:20.834
IS FOR.

21:20.834 --> 21:21.967
>> John: "THAT'S WHAT INSURANCE

21:21.967 --> 21:23.567
IS FOR."

21:23.567 --> 21:24.767
THAT MAY BE THE MOST RECKLESS

21:24.767 --> 21:26.633
STATEMENT EVER SAID ON A BOAT.

21:26.633 --> 21:28.066
AND I AM VERY MUCH INCLUDING,

21:28.066 --> 21:29.567
"I CAN DEFINITELY MAKE THIS SHOT

21:29.567 --> 21:32.166
WORK," AND "HEY, LET'S FEED

21:32.166 --> 21:34.500
THESE GULLS SOME TOSTITOS!"

21:34.500 --> 21:36.800
I DON'T HAVE ANY!

21:36.800 --> 21:38.233
ALL I DID WAS SAY THE WORD!

21:38.233 --> 21:42.100
GET OUT OF HERE!

21:42.100 --> 21:43.033
NO TOSTITOS!

21:43.033 --> 21:48.433
NO TOSTITOS!

21:48.433 --> 21:49.300
BUT MITCH --

21:49.300 --> 21:51.667
NO TOSTITOS!

21:51.667 --> 21:52.567
BUT MITCH ISN'T WRONG THAT,

21:52.567 --> 21:53.100
IF THEY BOUGHT THAT HOUSE,

21:53.100 --> 21:53.734
THEY COULD GET FLOOD INSURANCE,

21:53.734 --> 21:54.266
AND SURPRISINGLY CHEAPLY.

21:54.266 --> 21:54.900
AND IT'S WORTH TAKING SOME TIME

21:54.900 --> 21:55.700
TO UNDERSTAND WHY

21:55.700 --> 21:56.667
THAT'S THE CASE.

21:56.667 --> 21:58.033
BECAUSE UNLIKE OTHER FORMS OF

21:58.033 --> 21:59.867
HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE,

21:59.867 --> 22:00.700
FLOOD PROTECTION IS ACTUALLY

22:00.700 --> 22:03.000
UNDERWRITTEN BY THE GOVERNMENT

22:03.000 --> 22:04.033
THROUGH THE NFIP, OR NATIONAL

22:04.033 --> 22:05.934
FLOOD INSURANCE PROGRAM.

22:05.934 --> 22:07.633
IT STARTED NEARLY 50 YEARS AGO,

22:07.633 --> 22:08.967
AFTER HISTORIC FLOODS WIPED OUT

22:08.967 --> 22:09.900
MANY PEOPLE'S HOMES

22:09.900 --> 22:10.767
IN THE 1960s.

22:10.767 --> 22:12.433
AND THE GOVERNMENT THEN REALIZED

22:12.433 --> 22:13.567
THERE WAS A REAL PROBLEM.

22:13.567 --> 22:15.066
INSURANCE COMPANIES WOULDN'T

22:15.066 --> 22:16.734
COVER FLOODS AT AN AFFORDABLE

22:16.734 --> 22:18.734
COST BECAUSE IT WAS TOO RISKY.

22:18.734 --> 22:19.700
BECAUSE OF THAT,

22:19.700 --> 22:20.667
THE GOVERNMENT WAS SPENDING WAY

22:20.667 --> 22:22.600
TOO MUCH ON DISASTER RELIEF.

22:22.600 --> 22:24.834
SO THEY STEPPED IN AND CREATED

22:24.834 --> 22:25.567
THE NFIP, WHICH OFFERED

22:25.567 --> 22:27.200
SIGNIFICANTLY DISCOUNTED

22:27.200 --> 22:28.500
INSURANCE TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE

22:28.500 --> 22:29.400
TO BUY IT.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.600
AND THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.967
BUT CRUCIALLY, THE AIM AT THE

22:32.967 --> 22:34.967
TIME WAS NOT THAT PEOPLE WOULD

22:34.967 --> 22:36.367
BE STAYING IN AT-RISK HOMES

22:36.367 --> 22:38.166
PERMANENTLY, AS THE PROGRAM'S

22:38.166 --> 22:40.433
CURRENT ADMINISTRATOR EXPLAINS.

22:40.433 --> 22:41.867
>> THEY PRESUMED THAT IF WE TOLD

22:41.867 --> 22:43.867
PEOPLE THEY WERE AT RISK,

22:43.867 --> 22:46.100
THEY WOULD MOVE.

22:46.100 --> 22:47.333
THEY PRESUMED THAT OVER THE LIFE

22:47.333 --> 22:50.200
OF THE PROGRAM, THOSE DISCOUNTS

22:50.200 --> 22:51.834
WOULDN'T NEED TO BE CONTINUED,

22:51.834 --> 22:53.000
AND THEY PRESUMED IT WOULDN'T

22:53.000 --> 22:53.834
NEED TO BE CONTINUED BECAUSE

22:53.834 --> 22:54.700
ONCE PEOPLE KNEW THEY HAD THE

22:54.700 --> 22:57.166
RISK THEY WOULD MOVE OUT.

22:57.166 --> 23:02.533
THAT HAS NOT PROVEN TRUE.

23:02.533 --> 23:03.200
>> John: NO, BUT OF COURSE

23:03.200 --> 23:03.934
IT HASN'T.

23:03.934 --> 23:04.567
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HOW PEOPLE

23:04.567 --> 23:05.333
WORK.

23:05.333 --> 23:08.533
WE'LL GLADLY ACCEPT HUGE RISKS

23:08.533 --> 23:09.533
TO OUR PERSONAL SAFETY FOR THE

23:09.533 --> 23:10.200
SAKE OF A DISCOUNT.

23:10.200 --> 23:10.767
THAT WAS THE ENTIRE PREMISE

23:10.767 --> 23:11.400
BEHIND THE McDONALD'S

23:11.400 --> 23:13.767
DOLLAR MENU.

23:13.767 --> 23:14.967
AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE MANY

23:14.967 --> 23:15.934
FLAWS WITH HOW THIS

23:15.934 --> 23:17.166
WELL-INTENTIONED PROGRAM

23:17.166 --> 23:18.367
WAS DESIGNED.

23:18.367 --> 23:19.266
BECAUSE EVERYTHING ABOUT IT

23:19.266 --> 23:20.300
FROM WHO PARTICIPATES

23:20.300 --> 23:21.734
TO WHERE THE MONEY GOES

23:21.734 --> 23:22.700
TO THE INCENTIVES IT CREATES

23:22.700 --> 23:24.667
NEEDS FIXING.

23:24.667 --> 23:25.600
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

23:25.600 --> 23:26.934
THAT ELIGIBILITY FOR THE PROGRAM

23:26.934 --> 23:28.100
IS DETERMINED THROUGH FLOODPLAIN

23:28.100 --> 23:29.600
MAPS.

23:29.600 --> 23:30.567
YOU ARE REQUIRED TO BUY

23:30.567 --> 23:32.400
FLOOD INSURANCE IF YOU HAVE

23:32.400 --> 23:34.734
A FEDERALLY BACKED MORTGAGE

23:34.734 --> 23:35.867
AND FEMA'S MAPS SHOW YOU LIVE IN

23:35.867 --> 23:37.133
A RISKY AREA.

23:37.133 --> 23:38.433
UNFORTUNATELY, THE MANDATE HAS

23:38.433 --> 23:39.700
BEEN POORLY ENFORCED, MEANING

23:39.700 --> 23:40.934
LOTS OF PEOPLE DON'T BUY

23:40.934 --> 23:42.600
INSURANCE WHO SHOULD.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.367
AND THE MAPS THEMSELVES CAN BE

23:44.367 --> 23:46.000
BOTH OUT OF DATE AND WILDLY

23:46.000 --> 23:47.567
INACCURATE.

23:47.567 --> 23:49.100
IN FACT, JUST DAYS BEFORE HARVEY

23:49.100 --> 23:50.533
STRUCK, A STUDY OF HOUSTON-AREA

23:50.533 --> 23:52.500
FLOOD MAPS WAS PUBLISHED,

23:52.500 --> 23:54.633
AND THE RESULTS WERE ALARMING.

23:54.633 --> 23:56.266
>> OVER THE COURSE OF A DECADE,

23:56.266 --> 23:57.100
RESEARCHERS AT RICE UNIVERSITY

23:57.100 --> 23:58.834
AND TEXAS A&M GALVESTON

23:58.834 --> 24:00.667
STUDIED ONE SECTION OF SOUTHEAST

24:00.667 --> 24:01.767
HARRIS COUNTY.

24:01.767 --> 24:03.500
THEY FOUND FEMA'S FLOOD PLAIN

24:03.500 --> 24:05.300
MAPS MISSED ABOUT 75%

24:05.300 --> 24:08.500
OF THE DAMAGES FROM THE STORMS.

24:08.500 --> 24:09.367
>> John: 75%.

24:09.367 --> 24:10.867
AT THAT POINT, YOU MIGHT AS WELL

24:10.867 --> 24:11.934
PREDICT FLOODS BY HAVING

24:11.934 --> 24:13.133
BLINDFOLDED 6-YEAR-OLDS

24:13.133 --> 24:14.967
PIN LITTLE CARDBOARD PUDDLES

24:14.967 --> 24:15.734
ONTO CITY MAPS AT BIRTHDAY

24:15.734 --> 24:17.533
PARTIES.

24:17.533 --> 24:18.734
BUT EVEN IF ALL THE MAPS WERE

24:18.734 --> 24:20.934
PERFECT, THERE'D BE ANOTHER FLAW

24:20.934 --> 24:21.967
WITH THE NFIP, WHICH IS HOW

24:21.967 --> 24:22.800
IT'S ADMINISTERED.

24:22.800 --> 24:23.800
YOU SEE, TYPICALLY,

24:23.800 --> 24:24.900
THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T DIRECTLY

24:24.900 --> 24:25.667
INSURE YOU.

24:25.667 --> 24:27.533
INSTEAD, IT PAYS PRIVATE

24:27.533 --> 24:29.600
INSURANCE COMPANIES A FEE

24:29.600 --> 24:31.200
FOR EVERY POLICY THEY SELL.

24:31.200 --> 24:32.000
BUT NOT JUST THAT.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.166
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THEN

24:33.166 --> 24:34.567
RESPONSIBLE FOR COVERING

24:34.567 --> 24:38.700
ANY LOSSES, WHICH IS A PRETTY

24:38.700 --> 24:39.934
FUCKING SWEET DEAL.

24:39.934 --> 24:40.834
THE COMPANIES TAKE NONE OF

24:40.834 --> 24:41.967
THE RISK, AND YET

24:41.967 --> 24:43.333
GET ALL THE REWARDS.

24:43.333 --> 24:44.433
BUT IT GETS WORSE.

24:44.433 --> 24:45.633
BECAUSE THEY ALSO GET PAID

24:45.633 --> 24:47.567
FOR EACH CLAIM THEY HANDLE.

24:47.567 --> 24:48.266
AND WHEN "FRONTLINE" CRUNCHED

24:48.266 --> 24:49.300
SOME OF THE NUMBERS AND

24:49.300 --> 24:50.100
PRESENTED THEM TO A FORMER HEAD

24:50.100 --> 24:51.367
OF THE PROGRAM, THEY FOUND

24:51.367 --> 24:53.633
SOMETHING SHOCKING.

24:53.633 --> 24:54.533
>> THERE WAS ONE NUMBER

24:54.533 --> 24:56.433
THAT REALLY JUMPED OUT.

24:56.433 --> 24:57.300
WITH ALL THE CLAIMS IN THE WAKE

24:57.300 --> 24:59.800
OF SANDY, THE PROFITS WERE MORE

24:59.800 --> 25:03.200
THAN $400 MILLION.

25:03.200 --> 25:03.867
>> BECAUSE THEY'RE HANDLING

25:03.867 --> 25:04.734
A LOT OF CLAIMS THAT YEAR,

25:04.734 --> 25:06.300
AND THEY GET -- MAKE A LOT OF

25:06.300 --> 25:07.700
MONEY WHEN THEY HANDLE CLAIMS.

25:07.700 --> 25:09.166
>> WHEN A BIG STORM HITS, THEN,

25:09.166 --> 25:10.934
THEY MAKE MORE MONEY?

25:10.934 --> 25:11.900
>> YEAH, AT THE VERY TIME YOU

25:11.900 --> 25:13.066
NEED THEM TO MAKE LESS MONEY,

25:13.066 --> 25:15.700
IF ANYTHING, BECAUSE THE BURDEN

25:15.700 --> 25:16.667
IS GOING TO BE BORNE BY THE

25:16.667 --> 25:20.567
TAXPAYERS, THEY MAKE A KILLING.

25:20.567 --> 25:21.166
>> John: THAT'S TRUE.

25:21.166 --> 25:21.734
FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES,

25:21.734 --> 25:22.767
THE BIGGER THE DISASTER,

25:22.767 --> 25:24.767
THE MORE THEY STAND TO PROFIT.

25:24.767 --> 25:25.567
IT'S A BUSINESS MODEL

25:25.567 --> 25:27.000
NOT USUALLY SEEN OUTSIDE OF

25:27.000 --> 25:29.867
NICOLAS CAGE'S CAREER.

25:29.867 --> 25:31.467
AND WHILE THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY

25:31.467 --> 25:32.734
MAY DISPUTE EXACTLY HOW MUCH

25:32.734 --> 25:33.500
PROFIT THEY MAKE, THE FACT

25:33.500 --> 25:34.900
REMAINS THAT THE GOVERNMENT

25:34.900 --> 25:35.867
AND THE TAXPAYER

25:35.867 --> 25:37.300
ARE DEFINITELY THE ONES

25:37.300 --> 25:38.600
EATING THE LOSSES.

25:38.600 --> 25:39.567
WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY,

25:39.567 --> 25:40.767
EVEN BEFORE THESE LATEST

25:40.767 --> 25:42.600
HURRICANES, THE PROGRAM WAS

25:42.600 --> 25:45.433
$25 BILLION IN DEBT.

25:45.433 --> 25:46.767
AND THERE AREN'T ENOUGH

25:46.767 --> 25:48.433
ROSEATE SPOONBILLS IN THE WORLD

25:48.433 --> 25:49.367
TO TAKE YOUR MIND OFF

25:49.367 --> 25:50.467
THAT SORT OF THING.

25:50.467 --> 25:51.633
AND JUST TO BE CLEAR, THERE ARE

25:51.633 --> 25:53.266
EXACTLY ENOUGH ROSEATE

25:53.266 --> 25:55.667
SPOONBILLS IN THE WORLD.

25:55.667 --> 25:57.266
I'M JUST SAYING DO WE ALL REALLY

25:57.266 --> 26:02.200
NEED MORE OF THIS?

26:02.266 --> 26:08.367
"HEY, KIDS, COME SEE!

26:08.367 --> 26:08.900
THE DIRTY PINK DINOSAUR

26:08.900 --> 26:10.467
IS NOISILY DEVOURING ITS YOUNG!"

26:10.467 --> 26:12.066
AND LOOK, THERE IS A GOOD

26:12.066 --> 26:12.867
ARGUMENT TO MAKE THAT HELPING

26:12.867 --> 26:13.934
PEOPLE STAY IN THEIR HOMES AFTER

26:13.934 --> 26:14.600
A DISASTER IS WHAT GOVERNMENT

26:14.600 --> 26:16.200
IS FOR.

26:16.200 --> 26:17.533
BUT REMEMBER, A BIG CHUNK OF

26:17.533 --> 26:20.834
THAT MONEY IS JUST GOING TO THE

26:20.834 --> 26:21.734
INSURANCE COMPANIES.

26:21.734 --> 26:22.967
AND ANOTHER, SHOCKINGLY BIG,

26:22.967 --> 26:24.033
CHUNK OF THAT MONEY GOES TO

26:24.033 --> 26:25.467
VERY FEW HOMES.

26:25.467 --> 26:28.166
FOR INSTANCE, ALONG THE GULF

26:28.166 --> 26:28.934
COAST IN FLORIDA, JUST 1%

26:28.934 --> 26:29.767
OF PROPERTIES COVERED BY

26:29.767 --> 26:31.667
THE NFIP HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR

26:31.667 --> 26:34.600
A QUARTER OF FLOOD CLAIMS.

26:34.600 --> 26:37.033
THESE ARE SO-CALLED "REPETITIVE

26:37.033 --> 26:38.567
LOSS PROPERTIES," HOMES THAT CAN

26:38.567 --> 26:39.834
FLOOD OVER AND OVER AND OVER

26:39.834 --> 26:40.667
AGAIN, GETTING PAYMENTS EACH

26:40.667 --> 26:42.533
TIME.

26:42.533 --> 26:43.800
AND SOME OF THEM

26:43.800 --> 26:45.333
ARE COSTING US A FORTUNE.

26:45.333 --> 26:46.233
>> JUST RECENTLY AN ARTICLE IN

26:46.233 --> 26:47.700
THE WASHINGTON POST HIGHLIGHTED

26:47.700 --> 26:49.400
A HOME IN POINTE COUPEE PARISH

26:49.400 --> 26:51.433
THAT HAS FLOODED 40 TIMES.

26:51.433 --> 26:53.266
WHILE THE HOUSE IS VALUED AT

26:53.266 --> 26:55.633
JUST $56,000, THE NFIP HAS DOLED

26:55.633 --> 26:58.266
OUT NEARLY $430,000

26:58.266 --> 27:03.400
TO COVER FLOOD CLAIMS.

27:03.400 --> 27:04.200
>> John: SO THAT'S JUST

27:04.200 --> 27:04.934
STUPID.

27:04.934 --> 27:05.934
IF NOTHING ELSE, IF YOUR HOUSE

27:05.934 --> 27:07.333
FLOODS 40 TIMES, MOTHER NATURE

27:07.333 --> 27:08.300
IS SENDING YOU A PRETTY CLEAR

27:08.300 --> 27:09.934
MESSAGE, AND THAT'S,

27:09.934 --> 27:11.166
"HEY, WOULD YOU MIND LEAVING?

27:11.166 --> 27:12.433
SOME WEIRD FISH WOULD LIKE

27:12.433 --> 27:14.767
TO FUCK IN HERE NOW."

27:14.767 --> 27:15.900
AND SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY

27:15.900 --> 27:16.934
HAVE PARTICULARLY EXTREME

27:16.934 --> 27:18.567
EXAMPLES OF THIS.

27:18.567 --> 27:21.200
REMEMBER MITCH AND DANIEL?

27:21.200 --> 27:22.066
THE PASTEL DEATHTRAP THEY WERE

27:22.066 --> 27:23.300
LOOKING AT IS ON A PLACE CALLED

27:23.300 --> 27:24.033
DAUPHIN ISLAND, WHERE OVER

27:24.033 --> 27:25.266
THE PAST TWO DECADES,

27:25.266 --> 27:26.900
HOMEOWNERS HAVE "PAID JUST

27:26.900 --> 27:29.900
$9.3 MILLION IN PREMIUMS"

27:29.900 --> 27:32.333
IN TO THE NFIP BUT RECEIVED

27:32.333 --> 27:33.934
$72.2 MILLION IN PAYMENTS

27:33.934 --> 27:35.867
FOR THEIR DAMAGED HOMES.

27:35.867 --> 27:37.133
IT'S SO BAD, THE ISLAND GOT

27:37.133 --> 27:38.300
WRITTEN UP BY BLOOMBERG UNDER

27:38.300 --> 27:39.633
THE HEADLINE,

27:39.633 --> 27:41.100
"LOVE OF COASTAL LIVING IS

27:41.100 --> 27:43.734
DRAINING U.S. DISASTER FUNDS."

27:43.734 --> 27:44.400
AND AT FIRST GLANCE, WE THOUGHT,

27:44.400 --> 27:45.266
HOLD ON.

27:45.266 --> 27:47.367
ISN'T THAT THE EXACT SAME

27:47.367 --> 27:48.934
EYESORE ON STILTS THAT MITCH

27:48.934 --> 27:50.100
AND DANIEL ALMOST BOUGHT?

27:50.100 --> 27:50.667
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS,

27:50.667 --> 27:52.066
IT'S NOT.

27:52.066 --> 27:53.734
THE BAD NEWS IS, IT'S LITERALLY

27:53.734 --> 27:55.667
THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR, AND IT WAS

27:55.667 --> 27:57.333
ALSO FEATURED ON A DIFFERENT

27:57.333 --> 28:00.800
EPISODE OF "BUYING THE BEACH."

28:00.800 --> 28:02.633
>> IT'S RIGHT IN THE WATER.

28:02.633 --> 28:04.467
IT WASN'T CLOSE TO THE BEACH.

28:04.467 --> 28:05.767
IT WAS IN THE OCEAN.

28:05.767 --> 28:07.200
>> THE WAVES ARE JUST

28:07.200 --> 28:10.266
RIGHT HERE.

28:10.266 --> 28:12.867
OOH, IT'S LITERALLY IN OCEAN.

28:12.867 --> 28:14.700
THIS IS INSANE.

28:14.700 --> 28:16.533
>> John: YEAH, IT IS INSANE.

28:16.533 --> 28:17.500
BUT WHAT'S EVEN CRAZIER IS,

28:17.500 --> 28:19.600
AT THE END OF THE EPISODE,

28:19.600 --> 28:22.734
THEY DECIDED TO BUY THAT HOUSE.

28:22.734 --> 28:24.266
BUT EVEN IF YOU WERE ABLE TO

28:24.266 --> 28:25.233
OVERLOOK THE REPETITIVE LOSS

28:25.233 --> 28:26.867
PROPERTIES, WHICH YOU SHOULDN'T,

28:26.867 --> 28:27.934
THERE'S ANOTHER ISSUE.

28:27.934 --> 28:29.600
NEARLY ONE OUT OF EVERY FIVE

28:29.600 --> 28:31.567
HOMES COVERED UNDER THE NFIP

28:31.567 --> 28:33.500
IS ACTUALLY A SECOND HOME.

28:33.500 --> 28:34.600
AND BECAUSE THE PROGRAM ISN'T

28:34.600 --> 28:36.233
MEANS-TESTED, THE BENEFITS

28:36.233 --> 28:37.767
FREQUENTLY GO TO SOME WEALTHY

28:37.767 --> 28:39.367
INDIVIDUALS' VACATION HOMES.

28:39.367 --> 28:40.033
ONE SUCH PROPERTY BELONGED TO

28:40.033 --> 28:41.800
JOHN STOSSEL, FOX NEWS

28:41.800 --> 28:43.867
PERSONALITY AND PARTIALLY

28:43.867 --> 28:46.200
HYDROGENATED TOM SELLECK.

28:46.200 --> 28:47.433
AND I'LL LET STOSSEL,

28:47.433 --> 28:48.200
WHO ANSWERS THE QUESTION,

28:48.200 --> 28:49.433
"WHAT IF FREDDIE MERCURY

28:49.433 --> 28:50.600
HAD QUIT SINGING TO BECOME AN

28:50.600 --> 28:51.266
ASSISTANT FLOOR MANAGER AT MEN'S

28:51.266 --> 28:54.367
WEARHOUSE," TELL YOU ABOUT IT,

28:54.367 --> 28:55.667
BECAUSE EVEN HE KNEW IT WAS

28:55.667 --> 28:57.533
RIDICULOUS.

28:57.533 --> 28:58.333
>> YEARS AGO, I BUILT THIS BEACH

28:58.333 --> 29:00.066
HOUSE.

29:00.066 --> 29:02.133
THAT'S YOUNGER ME THERE.

29:02.133 --> 29:03.400
THE HOUSE WAS ON THE EDGE OF THE

29:03.400 --> 29:05.233
ATLANTIC OCEAN, A RISKY PLACE

29:05.233 --> 29:08.133
TO BUILD, BUT I BUILT ANYWAY,

29:08.133 --> 29:09.266
'CAUSE A FEDERAL PROGRAM

29:09.266 --> 29:11.633
GUARANTEED MY INVESTMENT.

29:11.633 --> 29:12.533
EVENTUALLY A STORM SWEPT AWAY

29:12.533 --> 29:14.367
MY FIRST FLOOR, BUT I DIDN'T

29:14.367 --> 29:16.033
LOSE A PENNY.

29:16.033 --> 29:17.300
THANKS.

29:17.300 --> 29:18.800
I NEVER INVITED YOU THERE, BUT

29:18.800 --> 29:21.567
YOU PAID FOR MY NEW FIRST FLOOR.

29:21.567 --> 29:23.367
>> John: OKAY, NOW HE'S JUST

29:23.367 --> 29:24.433
BAITING PEOPLE.

29:24.433 --> 29:25.934
BECAUSE UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES

29:25.934 --> 29:27.400
DOES ANYONE WANT TO BE FUNDING

29:27.400 --> 29:29.400
THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE

29:29.400 --> 29:30.600
WORLD'S SMUGGEST MAN'S RICKETY

29:30.600 --> 29:32.533
SEA PRISON.

29:32.533 --> 29:33.333
AND THERE'S LOTS TO BE CONFUSED

29:33.333 --> 29:35.967
ABOUT THERE, NOT LEAST THAT

29:35.967 --> 29:37.734
PHOTO OF STOSSEL, POSING

29:37.734 --> 29:39.467
SHIRTLESS IN SKINTIGHT

29:39.467 --> 29:40.900
WHITE SWIM TRUNKS FROM HUNDREDS

29:40.900 --> 29:42.166
OF FEET AWAY.

29:42.166 --> 29:44.567
WHO TOOK THAT PHOTO?

29:44.567 --> 29:45.734
IT CAN'T BE ANOTHER HUMAN

29:45.734 --> 29:47.300
WHO WANTED IT.

29:47.300 --> 29:49.033
SO HERE'S MY GUESS.

29:49.033 --> 29:49.934
I THINK THAT HE PUT A CAMERA

29:49.934 --> 29:51.133
ON A LONG-DELAY TIMER,

29:51.133 --> 29:52.633
THEN SPRINTED FOR A FULL

29:52.633 --> 29:54.166
45 SECONDS BACK TO THE DECK OF

29:54.166 --> 29:55.533
HIS HOUSE, WHISPERING

29:55.533 --> 29:57.533
"HURRY, HURRY, HURRY" TO HIMSELF

29:57.533 --> 29:58.700
THE ENTIRE TIME, AND GOT IN

29:58.700 --> 29:59.967
POSITION JUST IN TIME

29:59.967 --> 30:02.066
FOR THAT PHOTO TO HAPPEN.

30:02.066 --> 30:03.066
THAT'S THE ONLY SCIENTIFICALLY

30:03.066 --> 30:05.300
POSSIBLE EXPLANATION.

30:05.300 --> 30:07.834
WE DEBATED THIS FOR A WEEK,

30:07.834 --> 30:09.033
AND IT'S THE ONLY SCENARIO

30:09.033 --> 30:17.734
WE COULD ALL AGREE ON.

30:17.734 --> 30:18.700
AND LOOK, HERE'S THE THING.

30:18.700 --> 30:19.500
IF YOU CHOOSE TO BUILD

30:19.500 --> 30:20.166
SOMETHING IN A RISKY PLACE, LIKE

30:20.166 --> 30:20.867
JOHN STOSSEL'S SALT-BATTERED,

30:20.867 --> 30:23.000
BOTTOMS-ONLY BEACH-MISTAKE,

30:23.000 --> 30:23.633
YOU SHOULD ABSOLUTELY BE ALLOWED

30:23.633 --> 30:25.300
TO DO THAT.

30:25.300 --> 30:26.667
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T EXPECT

30:26.667 --> 30:27.667
THE GOVERNMENT TO REPEATEDLY

30:27.667 --> 30:29.233
HELP YOU REBUILD WHEN THINGS

30:29.233 --> 30:31.233
INEVITABLY GO WRONG.

30:31.233 --> 30:32.233
HOWEVER THE VAST MAJORITY

30:32.233 --> 30:35.700
OF NFIP BENEFICIARIES ARE NOT

30:35.700 --> 30:38.400
WEALTHY OR SECOND HOME OWNERS.

30:38.400 --> 30:39.266
THEY OFTEN REALLY NEED THIS

30:39.266 --> 30:40.734
PROGRAM, AND CAN'T AFFORD FOR IT

30:40.734 --> 30:42.300
TO GO UNDER.

30:42.300 --> 30:43.033
AND FOR THOSE STUCK IN

30:43.033 --> 30:44.300
REPETITIVE LOSS PROPERTIES,

30:44.300 --> 30:46.633
IT'S EASY TO SAY THEY SHOULD

30:46.633 --> 30:49.433
JUST MOVE, BUT IT IS MUCH MORE

30:49.433 --> 30:51.000
DIFFICULT THAN THAT,

30:51.000 --> 30:52.333
AS THIS KENTUCKY WOMAN,

30:52.333 --> 30:53.233
WHOSE HOME HAS FLOODED

30:53.233 --> 30:55.066
REPEATEDLY, WILL TELL YOU.

30:55.066 --> 30:56.867
>> WE COULDN'T SELL OUR HOUSE.

30:56.867 --> 30:58.367
WHO WOULD WANT TO BUY A HOUSE

30:58.367 --> 31:00.333
THAT'S HAD THIS MANY REPETITIVE

31:00.333 --> 31:02.066
FLOODS IN IT?

31:02.066 --> 31:04.133
WHO WOULD WANNA BUY IT?

31:04.133 --> 31:05.133
WE HAVE NEIGHBORS THAT HAVE HAD

31:05.133 --> 31:06.367
THEIR HOUSES UP FOR SALE FOR

31:06.367 --> 31:08.300
TWO, THREE YEARS, THAT HAVEN'T

31:08.300 --> 31:09.200
EVEN HAD ANYONE COME AND VIEW

31:09.200 --> 31:11.266
THE HOUSE.

31:11.266 --> 31:13.500
WE NEED A BUYOUT FROM FEMA

31:13.500 --> 31:15.433
OR FROM WHOEVER IT IS

31:15.433 --> 31:21.300
THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

31:21.300 --> 31:22.500
>> John: RIGHT, AND THE DECISION

31:22.500 --> 31:23.166
TO TRY AND LEAVE COULDN'T HAVE

31:23.166 --> 31:23.633
BEEN EASY.

31:23.633 --> 31:24.533
BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO THROW

31:24.533 --> 31:25.300
OUT THE BABY WITH THE

31:25.300 --> 31:27.100
FLOODWATER, BUT AT A CERTAIN

31:27.100 --> 31:27.834
POINT, THE RESPONSIBLE THING

31:27.834 --> 31:28.967
TO DO IS GET A BETTER,

31:28.967 --> 31:31.533
MORE WATER-RESISTANT BABY.

31:31.533 --> 31:32.734
WHICH IS, INCIDENTALLY,

31:32.734 --> 31:33.300
ALSO THE TITLE OF BRITAIN'S

31:33.300 --> 31:34.467
BEST-SELLING BOOK ON TEACHING

31:34.467 --> 31:36.500
CHILDREN TO SWIM.

31:36.500 --> 31:37.567
UNFORTUNATELY, OUR BUYOUT

31:37.567 --> 31:39.400
PROGRAMS ARE HUGELY UNDERFUNDED

31:39.400 --> 31:41.700
AND PROHIBITIVELY SLOW.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.333
IT CAN TAKE YEARS FOR BUYOUTS

31:43.333 --> 31:44.667
TO GET APPROVED, BY WHICH POINT,

31:44.667 --> 31:45.800
HOMEOWNERS HAVE PROBABLY HAD

31:45.800 --> 31:47.667
TO REBUILD THEIR HOUSE,

31:47.667 --> 31:52.133
AT THE GOVERNMENT'S EXPENSE,

31:52.133 --> 31:52.900
AND IT MAY HAVE ALREADY FLOODED

31:52.900 --> 31:53.400
AGAIN.

31:53.400 --> 31:54.300
SO, ESSENTIALLY, A GOVERNMENT

31:54.300 --> 31:55.266
PROGRAM THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO

31:55.266 --> 31:56.633
HELP PEOPLE IN FLOODED HOMES

31:56.633 --> 31:59.967
IS SOMETIMES TRAPPING THEM

31:59.967 --> 32:01.934
INSIDE THEM INDEFINITELY.

32:01.934 --> 32:02.834
TRAPPING PEOPLE IN

32:02.834 --> 32:03.400
STRUCTURALLY UNSOUND HOUSES

32:03.400 --> 32:03.967
ISN'T WHAT THE GOVERNMENT

32:03.967 --> 32:07.000
IS FOR.

32:07.000 --> 32:07.900
IT'S WHAT "BUYING THE BEACH"

32:07.900 --> 32:08.567
IS FOR.

32:08.567 --> 32:09.166
LOOK, THERE JUST HAS TO BE

32:09.166 --> 32:09.934
A BETTER WAY.

32:09.934 --> 32:10.934
AND THERE ARE SOME KEY THINGS WE

32:10.934 --> 32:12.800
CAN DO TO IMPROVE THIS PROGRAM.

32:12.800 --> 32:13.734
WE CAN DO THINGS LIKE MEANS-TEST

32:13.734 --> 32:15.100
IT, AND EVENTUALLY GET RID OF

32:15.100 --> 32:16.867
DISCOUNTS FOR SECOND HOMES,

32:16.867 --> 32:18.667
AND GRADUALLY INCREASE INSURANCE

32:18.667 --> 32:19.967
RATES ON SOME PROPERTIES SO THEY

32:19.967 --> 32:21.934
REFLECT ACTUAL RISK.

32:21.934 --> 32:23.700
UNFORTUNATELY, THE LAST TIME

32:23.700 --> 32:25.000
CONGRESS TRIED A MAJOR REFORM

32:25.000 --> 32:25.500
OF THE NFIP,

32:25.500 --> 32:26.500
WITH THE BIGGERT-WATERS ACT OF

32:26.500 --> 32:28.467
2012, THE RESULT WAS THAT MANY

32:28.467 --> 32:30.200
PEOPLE'S RATES SKYROCKETED

32:30.200 --> 32:31.934
OVERNIGHT.

32:31.934 --> 32:33.500
AND POLITICIANS WERE SO SPOOKED

32:33.500 --> 32:34.800
BY ANGRY CONSTITUENTS,

32:34.800 --> 32:35.500
THEY SIGNIFICANTLY SCALED BACK

32:35.500 --> 32:37.834
MANY OF THE REFORMS.

32:37.834 --> 32:38.800
AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS WILL

32:38.800 --> 32:40.867
EVER BE POLITICALLY EASY.

32:40.867 --> 32:42.133
BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU DO PROPERLY

32:42.133 --> 32:43.967
FUND AND STREAMLINE A BUYOUT

32:43.967 --> 32:45.834
SCHEME, THERE ARE GOING TO BE

32:45.834 --> 32:47.367
CASES WHERE PEOPLE JUST WANT

32:47.367 --> 32:48.767
TO STAY PUT.

32:48.767 --> 32:50.834
RIGHT HERE IN NEW YORK,

32:50.834 --> 32:51.500
THERE'S A LOW-LYING

32:51.500 --> 32:52.700
COMMUNITY CALLED BROAD CHANNEL

32:52.700 --> 32:53.467
WHERE THE STREETS CAN FLOOD

32:53.467 --> 32:56.233
TWICE A MONTH.

32:56.233 --> 32:57.266
ITS RESIDENTS FOUGHT AGAINST

32:57.266 --> 32:58.367
THOSE RATE INCREASES A FEW YEARS

32:58.367 --> 32:59.000
AGO.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.000
AND MANY OF THEM HAVE

33:00.000 --> 33:02.567
NO INTEREST IN LEAVING.

33:02.567 --> 33:03.400
>> NAH, THE NEIGHBORHOOD

33:03.400 --> 33:05.500
IS TOO GREAT.

33:05.500 --> 33:06.533
LISTEN, MY WHOLE HOUSE

33:06.533 --> 33:07.734
GOT DESTROYED BY SANDY.

33:07.734 --> 33:11.867
AND I REDID MY WHOLE HOUSE.

33:11.867 --> 33:12.600
PEOPLE ARE LIKE, YOU'RE CRAZY,

33:12.600 --> 33:13.734
YOU SHOULD MOVE.

33:13.734 --> 33:17.900
I SAID, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

33:17.900 --> 33:18.600
>> John: BUT YOU'RE STANDING

33:18.600 --> 33:21.000
IN WATER RIGHT NOW.

33:21.000 --> 33:21.767
MAYBE THE PEOPLE TELLING YOU

33:21.767 --> 33:22.767
TO MOVE WERE SAYING,

33:22.767 --> 33:24.734
"AT THE VERY LEAST, CAN YOU MOVE

33:24.734 --> 33:28.200
UP FIVE INCHES TO DRY LAND?"

33:28.200 --> 33:30.433
BUT THE HARD TRUTH HERE IS,

33:30.433 --> 33:32.100
EVEN EXPENSIVE INTERVENTIONS

33:32.100 --> 33:32.867
ARE LIKELY TO ONLY BUY THAT

33:32.867 --> 33:34.266
COMMUNITY A LITTLE MORE TIME,

33:34.266 --> 33:35.934
AND PEOPLE IN BROAD CHANNEL WILL

33:35.934 --> 33:38.333
EVENTUALLY BE LEAVING, WHETHER

33:38.333 --> 33:40.467
IT'S BY MOVING TRUCK OR BY BOAT.

33:40.467 --> 33:41.800
BECAUSE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS

33:41.800 --> 33:44.600
ARE GOING TO GET WORSE.

33:44.600 --> 33:45.400
HEAVY DOWNPOURS HAVE INCREASED

33:45.400 --> 33:46.800
IN THE LAST 50 YEARS.

33:46.800 --> 33:48.734
AND SEA LEVELS HAVE BEEN

33:48.734 --> 33:49.200
CLIMBING STEADILY.

33:49.200 --> 33:50.567
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S

33:50.567 --> 33:52.133
BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE,

33:52.133 --> 33:57.000
EVEN THOUGH...

33:57.000 --> 34:01.834
>> IT IS!

34:01.834 --> 34:02.500
>> John: IT JUST IS.

34:02.500 --> 34:03.667
PRECISELY.

34:03.667 --> 34:04.500
THE NFIP IS ACTUALLY DUE FOR

34:04.500 --> 34:05.633
REAUTHORIZATION THIS DECEMBER,

34:05.633 --> 34:06.700
AND I'D ARGUE IT'S TIME TO TAKE

34:06.700 --> 34:07.700
ANOTHER SHOT AT SERIOUS,

34:07.700 --> 34:09.934
THOUGHTFUL REFORM.

34:09.934 --> 34:11.467
BECAUSE WITHOUT IT, WE HAVE

34:11.467 --> 34:13.934
AN UNSUSTAINABLE PROGRAM THAT'S

34:13.934 --> 34:15.333
INDIRECTLY HARMING SOME OF THE

34:15.333 --> 34:16.467
PEOPLE THAT IT WAS DESIGNED

34:16.467 --> 34:19.633
TO HELP.

34:19.633 --> 34:20.934
I DON'T HAVE ANY--

34:20.934 --> 34:22.900
>> JOHN, JOHN, RELAX.

34:22.900 --> 34:26.834
I'M NOT HERE FOR TOSTITOS.

34:26.834 --> 34:27.467
>> John: REALLY?

34:27.467 --> 34:27.900
HOLD ON.

34:27.900 --> 34:31.200
YOU CAN TALK?

34:31.200 --> 34:33.333
>> OF COURSE.

34:33.333 --> 34:34.066
SEAGULLS CAN TALK.

34:34.066 --> 34:34.600
WE JUST CHOOSE TO LISTEN

34:34.600 --> 34:35.066
MOST OF THE TIME.

34:35.066 --> 34:35.700
>> John: THAT'S NICE.

34:35.700 --> 34:36.367
>> I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT

34:36.367 --> 34:36.934
FLOODING, AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:36.934 --> 34:37.367
I'VE SEEN IT.

34:37.367 --> 34:38.767
I'M A SEAGULL.

34:38.767 --> 34:39.967
SOME PEOPLE IN HIGH-RISK AREAS

34:39.967 --> 34:41.133
WILL NEED TO MOVE.

34:41.133 --> 34:43.400
AND WE SHOULD GIVE THEM HELP

34:43.400 --> 34:45.133
TO DO THAT.

34:45.133 --> 34:46.500
BECAUSE WHILE LEAVING YOUR HOME

34:46.500 --> 34:47.800
IS HARD, BEING FORCED OUT WHEN

34:47.800 --> 34:49.233
IT'S UNINHABITABLE IS TEN TIMES

34:49.233 --> 34:50.467
HARDER.

34:50.467 --> 34:51.667
AND AFTER ALL, YOUR HOME

34:51.667 --> 34:53.500
ISN'T JUST WALLS AND A ROOF.

34:53.500 --> 34:54.166
IT'S WHERE THE PEOPLE

34:54.166 --> 34:57.066
YOU LOVE ARE.

34:57.066 --> 34:57.967
>> John: OH, SEAGULL.

34:57.967 --> 34:59.100
I GOTTA SAY THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY

34:59.100 --> 35:00.800
BEAUTIFUL.

35:00.800 --> 35:02.133
>> YEAH, NOT BAD FOR A FLYING

35:02.133 --> 35:08.333
BEACH RAT, HUH?
