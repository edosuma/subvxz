WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:03.421
<i>Previously on "Designated Survivor"...</i>

00:03.546 --> 00:05.756
- I don't understand. Where was I?
- That's my question, Congressman.

00:05.881 --> 00:08.801
Is there a reason you're asking these
questions? Have I done something wrong?

00:08.926 --> 00:10.469
You were supposed
to get a statement,

00:10.594 --> 00:11.804
not turn him into a suspect.

00:11.929 --> 00:12.763
Who is this?

00:12.888 --> 00:14.306
<i>Find room 105,</i>

00:14.432 --> 00:16.475
<i>and you'll understand more
about Peter MacLeish.</i>

00:16.600 --> 00:20.312
My name is Seth Wright. Earlier tonight,
I was named White House Press Secretary.

00:20.438 --> 00:21.897
He's an interesting guy,
your boss.

00:22.023 --> 00:23.733
- I have what you asked for.
- Anything good?

00:23.858 --> 00:25.401
Depends whose side you're on.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.487
Is it true that you gave the order to
take the Algerian air defenses offline?

00:28.612 --> 00:31.323
- Without clearing it through me.
- I did what needed to be done.

00:31.449 --> 00:32.491
General, you are fired.

00:32.616 --> 00:34.952
Admiral... prepare us for war.

01:06.442 --> 01:08.152
Yeah.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.071
<i>Mr. President, it's time.</i>

01:10.571 --> 01:13.115
The estimated
battle damage assessment, BDA,

01:13.240 --> 01:15.326
indicates that we will level
the entire compound

01:15.451 --> 01:17.995
and everything within
a 50-foot radius, Mr. President.

01:18.496 --> 01:21.791
Majid Nassar and his Al-Sakar cell
will be dead by dawn.

01:21.916 --> 01:23.876
Won't the laser-guided bomb's
blast effect

01:24.001 --> 01:25.544
- blow right through this village?
- No, sir.

01:25.669 --> 01:27.171
We only hit what we target.

01:27.296 --> 01:29.548
Good morning, Mr. President.
You wanted to see me?

01:29.673 --> 01:30.841
Thanks for coming in early.

01:30.966 --> 01:33.636
Seth, you've met Admiral Chernow?
He's the new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.346
How are you, sir?
Seth Wright, Press Secretary.

01:35.471 --> 01:37.556
Ah, it'll be a busy day for you, son.

01:37.681 --> 01:39.225
I'll be in Command Ops.

01:39.350 --> 01:40.643
- Admiral.
- Sir.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.812
I had to clear
my entire schedule for the day.

01:42.937 --> 01:44.021
Want to know why?

01:44.146 --> 01:46.565
If I know why, do I have
to lie to the press all day?

01:46.690 --> 01:48.150
- Yeah.
- Okay, then let's just assume

01:48.275 --> 01:50.569
that maybe somewhere
there's gonna be a military strike

01:50.694 --> 01:52.321
against the terrorist
who bombed the Capitol,

01:52.446 --> 01:54.573
- and I'll just know more when I know more.
- Good man.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.200
They can shuffle your schedule, sir,

01:56.325 --> 01:58.410
but the medal ceremony
for first responders,

01:58.536 --> 02:01.413
your absence would be conspicuous.
There's no VP to fill in.

02:01.539 --> 02:03.040
Then we'll make it work.
I'll be there.

02:03.874 --> 02:06.585
I thought <i>I</i> was up early.
I must've missed a memo.

02:06.710 --> 02:08.086
Trying to get ahead of the day.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.588
A losing proposition.

02:09.713 --> 02:11.006
Well, you've won one in Michigan.

02:11.132 --> 02:13.843
The Lieutenant Governor reversed
Royce's orders to the state police.

02:13.968 --> 02:16.428
The roundups arresting Muslim citizens,
they've all ceased.

02:16.554 --> 02:18.597
All it took was putting Governor Royce
in federal prison.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.724
We're gonna have
to deal with that soon. Thank you.

02:21.392 --> 02:24.395
I don't want to be out of line here,
but is all of this about Majid Nassar?

02:24.520 --> 02:27.565
Em, you did a great job in Michigan.
Right now, our main priority is Congress.

02:27.690 --> 02:29.233
I need you to take point on that.

02:30.151 --> 02:31.402
Of course.

02:35.739 --> 02:38.033
The F-18s are just over
the international marker, sir.

02:38.159 --> 02:39.034
At your command,

02:39.160 --> 02:41.370
they'll target Algerian airspace
and destroy the target.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.914
Algerian air-defense radar
still deactivated?

02:44.039 --> 02:46.083
Yes. We'll be in and out.
No one will know

02:46.208 --> 02:47.877
until the villagers
report the fireworks.

02:48.002 --> 02:50.296
What's our contingency plan in case
one of our planes goes down?

02:50.421 --> 02:51.881
Naval search
and rescue chopper,

02:52.006 --> 02:53.132
full squadron of Marines

02:53.257 --> 02:54.717
standing by on the USS Lexington.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.094
Mr. President, the F-18s
have less than 10 minutes

02:57.219 --> 02:58.429
before they have to consider refueling.

02:58.554 --> 03:01.056
If this mission is a go,
it needs to go now, sir.

03:09.398 --> 03:12.026
- It's a go. Strike the enemy.
- Yes, sir.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.196
Patch me in to the Lexington.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.156
The President has given the order.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.074
- You may proceed.
- Admiral, you need to hold.

03:19.450 --> 03:20.409
What's going on?

03:20.534 --> 03:23.746
Sir, I'm getting reports from my station
chief in Tangier. We need to abort.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.623
- Why?
- New intelligence indicates

03:25.748 --> 03:27.458
that the target
is no longer in the compound.

03:28.626 --> 03:29.752
We lost him, sir.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.630
We lost Majid Nassar.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.809
Satellite imagery
from NRO confirms

03:45.935 --> 03:47.686
that Nassar left the compound
two minutes ago

03:47.811 --> 03:49.521
in a small convoy of trucks.

03:49.647 --> 03:51.690
- It gets worse, sir.
- How is that possible?

03:51.815 --> 03:53.692
Seems Nassar was warned.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.694
By someone
inside the Algerian government?

03:55.819 --> 03:56.695
Yes, sir.

03:56.820 --> 03:58.113
Son of a bitch.

03:58.239 --> 04:00.032
Apparently, just prior
to leaving the compound,

04:00.157 --> 04:02.701
he received a call from someone
inside the foreign ministry.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.536
We did this, sir.
We tipped our hand.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.288
No, I did this trying to be diplomatic.

04:07.248 --> 04:09.541
I need you all to use
every resource available.

04:09.667 --> 04:13.545
Do whatever you have to,
but please find Majid Nassar.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.257
Damn it!

04:20.678 --> 04:22.012
Well, well, well.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.014
I wasn't expecting to see you today.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.350
- So, what are you working on?
- Capitol bombing.

04:26.475 --> 04:27.977
So you decided to sleep on it.

04:28.102 --> 04:29.520
Actually, I drank on it.

04:29.645 --> 04:31.355
Hmm. I hope it was a good bottle.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.482
It was the Chardonnay
you bought me last Christmas.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.650
Lightweight.

04:35.985 --> 04:37.194
So, what is all this?

04:37.319 --> 04:39.488
I'm looking for Capitol Room 105.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.825
You might want to try
between 104 and 106.

04:43.826 --> 04:44.910
It's not there.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.745
And this room
is significant why?

04:46.870 --> 04:48.580
Well, I don't know that it is, but...

04:48.706 --> 04:50.749
if the lead pans out,
you'll be the first to know.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.751
All right.
Good to see you.

04:52.876 --> 04:55.546
I'll be back in a few hours.
I need to get to the White House.

04:55.671 --> 04:57.589
- Another briefing?
- No, a medal ceremony.

04:57.715 --> 05:00.217
President decided
he wanted to honor MacLeish

05:00.342 --> 05:02.386
and the first responder
that found him.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.765
- Mind if I tag along?
- No, I think you should stay on that.

05:06.890 --> 05:08.600
Well, the man is a hero and a patriot.

05:08.726 --> 05:10.436
I would love to see MacLeish
get a medal.

05:10.561 --> 05:11.603
Oh, yeah?

05:11.729 --> 05:13.605
That's exactly why I never gave you
an undercover assignment,

05:13.731 --> 05:17.359
because you are a horrible liar.
Horrible.

05:18.319 --> 05:19.570
Come on.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.574
Bill Keirstead ran into the rubble

05:23.699 --> 05:25.617
without any regard
for his own safety

05:25.743 --> 05:28.329
and rescued our only survivor.

05:29.330 --> 05:32.541
Our nation thanks you,
and I thank you.

05:36.712 --> 05:40.049
My Secret Service code name
is Phoenix.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.425
But as most of us know,

05:41.550 --> 05:44.345
there is only one man
who truly rose from the ashes.

05:44.762 --> 05:46.638
And though it might seem odd
to some of you

05:46.764 --> 05:50.809
to award someone for simply surviving,
Congressman Peter MacLeish's story

05:50.934 --> 05:53.729
is anything
but one of simple survival.

05:54.563 --> 05:56.357
It's a story of perseverance.

05:57.191 --> 06:00.944
A soldier at 22,
a Congressman at 28.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.364
He is an inspiration to us all.

06:04.198 --> 06:07.409
Ladies and gentlemen,
Congressman Peter MacLeish.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.792
Just hope you never
look at me like that.

06:16.210 --> 06:18.587
- So good to see you doing so well.
- Sir.

06:18.962 --> 06:21.382
I'm so sorry.
Excuse me for one second.

06:22.216 --> 06:23.675
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

06:23.801 --> 06:25.844
Please join us in the East Room
for refreshments.

06:25.969 --> 06:27.054
Thank you.

06:30.432 --> 06:31.850
Mr. Wright.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.310
- Congresswoman.
- Lovely event.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.396
But I have a question.

06:35.979 --> 06:38.107
When is the United States
going to respond

06:38.232 --> 06:40.484
to Majid Nassar's bombing
of our Capitol?

06:41.235 --> 06:43.404
When our intelligence services
confirm his location.

06:44.405 --> 06:47.324
You're way too smart to play dumb,
Mr. Press Secretary.

06:47.449 --> 06:49.034
I need to talk to the President.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.537
The President's got
a very busy schedule today.

06:51.662 --> 06:52.996
I can wait.

06:53.664 --> 06:54.998
About your room 105,

06:55.124 --> 06:58.001
you might want to check
with the architect of the Capitol.

06:58.627 --> 07:02.423
Be a pain in someone else's ass
for a change, hmm?

07:04.758 --> 07:05.801
Agent Wells.

07:06.635 --> 07:07.886
Good to see you again.

07:08.011 --> 07:10.264
And you. Congratulations.

07:11.849 --> 07:12.891
Yeah, thank you.

07:13.016 --> 07:14.268
Congrats.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.898
Did we find Nassar?
Please sit.

07:20.023 --> 07:24.236
Intelligence still places him in Algeria
about 15 miles from the compound.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.071
But there's a major problem.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.156
What is it?

07:27.281 --> 07:30.159
He's in the basement of a hospital
with at least 100 staff and patients.

07:30.284 --> 07:33.495
Now, if we move forward
with an air strike as originally planned,

07:33.620 --> 07:36.915
we're going to kill a lot of civilians,
including doctors and children.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.501
Which is unacceptable.
What are our other options?

07:39.626 --> 07:41.753
Only one, sir. Navy SEALs.

07:41.879 --> 07:44.173
We'll minimize
civilian casualties, but--

07:44.298 --> 07:46.758
We'll have to put
American boots on the ground.

07:46.884 --> 07:48.385
It's the only way, sir.

07:49.052 --> 07:51.388
May we proceed, Mr. President?

07:59.354 --> 08:00.189
Mr. President.

08:00.898 --> 08:02.900
That's Keyhole satellite footage
of a hospital

08:03.025 --> 08:04.943
where Nassar's holed up
with extensive security.

08:05.068 --> 08:07.279
- And this is his convoy?
- Yes.

08:07.404 --> 08:10.699
But given the complexity of the mission,
this has become a Tier One operation.

08:10.824 --> 08:14.578
Now, JSOC is working with
SEAL Team 6 to plan the assault.

08:14.703 --> 08:18.123
Recent NSA chatter indicates
the potential of new attacks by Al-Sakar,

08:18.248 --> 08:19.750
both at home and abroad.

08:19.875 --> 08:23.337
Nassar could prove to be an extremely
valuable source of intelligence.

08:24.713 --> 08:25.756
Wait a second.

08:26.340 --> 08:28.800
You're talking about
taking Nassar alive?

08:28.926 --> 08:30.802
Won't that increase
the danger to our troops?

08:30.928 --> 08:32.554
Well, there are
no perfect missions, sir,

08:32.679 --> 08:34.389
but our confidence is very high.

08:34.515 --> 08:37.601
As much as I'd like to believe you,
Admiral, I'd like to talk to the man

08:37.726 --> 08:39.770
who's gonna be in charge
of the mission on the ground.

08:39.895 --> 08:40.979
Where is he?

08:41.104 --> 08:43.315
All due respect, sir,
there's a chain of command.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.525
<i>He</i> comes to <i>you.</i>

08:47.444 --> 08:50.280
I'm gonna ask these men
to put their lives on the line.

08:50.405 --> 08:52.950
I'll go see him.
Where is he?

08:53.283 --> 08:54.284
Little Creek, sir.

08:54.409 --> 08:56.119
- And where is that?
- Virginia.

08:56.954 --> 08:58.830
Looks like I'm going to Virginia.

08:58.956 --> 09:00.249
Aaron, make the necessary arrangements.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.959
- Thank you, gentlemen.
- Yes, sir.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.003
Emily. Hey, about this morning--

09:05.128 --> 09:08.632
Unnecessary, Aaron. I understand how
clearance works and that I don't have it.

09:08.757 --> 09:11.677
I just want to be clear you understand
this is not personal at all.

09:11.802 --> 09:13.470
I'm a big girl, Aaron.

09:13.595 --> 09:16.265
The President did what he had to do,
and I work for the President.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.017
Sorry I mentioned anything. Oh, hey.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.978
Uh, do you know a Jeffrey Myers?

09:21.770 --> 09:22.980
Doesn't ring a bell. Why?

09:24.982 --> 09:27.943
Somebody mentioned the name.
Thought he might know the Kirkmans.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.321
It's nothing.

09:36.493 --> 09:38.704
As an expert
on the architecture of the Capitol,

09:38.829 --> 09:40.664
I thought you could help the FBI.

09:40.789 --> 09:43.041
Agent Wells, I've got everyone calling:
NSA, DHS.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.836
Whatever you need, tell my assistant.
I'll get to it when I can.

09:45.961 --> 09:47.713
I know you're busy.
I just have one question.

09:47.838 --> 09:50.048
Room 105, it's not
in any of the Capitol directories.

09:50.173 --> 09:51.341
Is that it?

09:51.466 --> 09:53.051
- Yeah.
- Well, that's easy.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.886
Room 105 wouldn't be
in any official directory.

09:55.012 --> 09:56.513
- It's a hideaway office.
- What is that?

09:57.431 --> 10:00.142
It's a hidden office. There are several
throughout the Capitol assigned

10:00.267 --> 10:03.353
- by seniority to members of Congress.
- And they would have that because...?

10:04.021 --> 10:06.690
Privacy, work, rest.
Helps with late-night votes.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.900
Teddy Kennedy's
was like a clubhouse.

10:09.026 --> 10:10.444
Do you have the blueprints?

10:11.194 --> 10:12.529
Had.

10:12.654 --> 10:15.282
They were in our offices
in the sub-basement of the Capitol.

10:16.033 --> 10:17.909
I gave the digital plans
to the guys on site.

10:18.035 --> 10:20.329
- You might want to check over there.
- Okay, I will. Thank you.

10:20.454 --> 10:21.496
You're welcome.

10:21.622 --> 10:25.042
Next time, wait your turn
like everyone else.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.005
Thank you
for taking the time, Mr. President.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.007
I'll always make time for you, Kimble.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.426
I know how busy you must be
since your schedule's been cleared

10:34.551 --> 10:36.219
of most every appointment.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.765
I suppose you could say
I'm looking for explanations.

10:39.890 --> 10:43.018
In one day, you fired
your Chairman of the Joint Chiefs

10:43.143 --> 10:45.103
and arrested a sitting governor.

10:45.228 --> 10:46.563
It's erratic, sir.

10:47.064 --> 10:49.691
And now I find out that parking lot H
at the Pentagon

10:49.816 --> 10:52.027
was full this morning at 3:00 a.m.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.570
Parking lot H?

10:53.695 --> 10:55.739
It's where combat command parks.

10:56.239 --> 10:58.492
Two-star generals and up.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.870
Is there a question
you want to ask me?

11:02.496 --> 11:04.665
Are we going to war, Mr. President?

11:05.248 --> 11:07.292
I ask because
we're not a dictatorship,

11:07.417 --> 11:09.294
and as the presumptive
Speaker of the House,

11:09.419 --> 11:11.463
I'm here to remind you
of your obligation

11:11.588 --> 11:14.966
to consult with Congress <i>before</i>
taking any military action.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.385
Helicopter's here, sir.

11:17.511 --> 11:18.970
Article 1, Section 8.

11:19.096 --> 11:20.889
I'm aware of the clause,

11:21.682 --> 11:24.559
and I will notify you
as soon as it's appropriate.

11:24.685 --> 11:25.977
Thank you, Mr. President.

11:26.103 --> 11:29.106
It's reassuring to know that you're fully
aware of your constitutional duties.

11:29.690 --> 11:32.567
And thank you
for your continued vigilance.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.797
We're clear!

11:57.426 --> 12:00.637
Commander, do you mind walking me
through the operation?

12:00.762 --> 12:03.515
Plane ride on a C-5 Galaxy
to northern Mali.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.308
From the forward operating base,

12:05.434 --> 12:07.936
we fly two Black Hawks
into the landing zone.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.856
About two miles from the hospital
where Nassar is holed up.

12:10.981 --> 12:13.275
Land just after midnight,
set up a perimeter,

12:13.400 --> 12:15.694
carry out our assault,
all before daybreak.

12:15.819 --> 12:17.446
You make it sound so simple.

12:18.739 --> 12:20.449
Amateurs talk tactics, sir.

12:21.450 --> 12:23.034
Professionals talk logistics.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.536
My men train for missions like this

12:24.661 --> 12:27.497
all day, every day, Mr. President.

12:27.956 --> 12:30.333
I wish I could say the same
about myself.

12:30.459 --> 12:32.586
I mean, as your Commander in Chief.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.338
They're impressive.

12:35.464 --> 12:38.717
- The best, sir.
- That soldier there.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.343
How long
has he been with you?

12:40.469 --> 12:42.137
Chief Marino.
About three years.

12:42.262 --> 12:46.183
He's expecting his first kid
in a couple of months.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.852
How about the man talking to him?

12:48.977 --> 12:50.145
Petty Officer Denton.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.688
Just got married.

12:51.813 --> 12:54.691
Spent his honeymoon with me here
training for an op.

12:55.984 --> 12:57.402
Nonstop sacrifice.

13:00.363 --> 13:02.407
Commander, there is something
I need to know.

13:02.532 --> 13:05.035
Admiral Chernow has great
confidence in the operation,

13:05.160 --> 13:06.912
but you're the one
who has to lead it.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.705
What do you think the odds are?

13:09.623 --> 13:11.082
We'll get it done, sir.

13:11.208 --> 13:13.376
Forgive me, Commander,
but that's not what I asked.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.295
What are the odds?

13:18.215 --> 13:20.342
We don't know
if they've wired the place.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.677
We don't know if they've got
local militia in the area.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.889
We don't know a lot of things, sir.
I'd say our odds are 50/50.

13:27.390 --> 13:30.018
But we do know Nassar is there,

13:30.977 --> 13:33.021
so we have to do it now.

13:34.397 --> 13:35.899
May God have mercy on them,

13:36.024 --> 13:38.193
because the United States Navy
will have none.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.656
Thank you, Commander.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.123
Hector.

13:52.249 --> 13:53.625
You get my message
about MacLeish?

13:53.750 --> 13:55.418
Hey, Hannah, yeah.
I've been working on it.

13:55.544 --> 13:57.462
Okay, did you find his location
during the explosion?

13:57.587 --> 13:59.881
- Yeah, but it's just theoretical.
- Show me.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.633
That's where
MacLeish was found.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.135
Okay, now, I'll superimpose
the Capitol blueprint

14:04.261 --> 14:06.429
to find the Congressman's
exact location.

14:10.433 --> 14:11.852
Room 105.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.939
Can your team piece together parts
of this office from the wreckage?

14:16.064 --> 14:18.859
You realize that debris doesn't consist
of perfect jigsaw pieces?

14:19.442 --> 14:21.570
Besides, we don't even have
the current schematics

14:21.695 --> 14:23.321
on that section
because of the renovations.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.574
- What renovations?
- We just found out ourselves.

14:25.699 --> 14:28.743
Capitol renovations have been classified
since World War II by Congress,

14:28.869 --> 14:31.496
so without any real Congress,
we can't get access.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.164
Let me take care of that.

14:33.290 --> 14:35.458
Do what you can right away.

14:40.463 --> 14:41.756
Mr. President.

14:42.716 --> 14:43.800
Chief Edward Marino.

14:43.925 --> 14:45.886
Our advanced demo expert.

14:46.469 --> 14:47.762
Petty Officer John Denton

14:47.888 --> 14:50.181
will be our assault team leader
on the ground.

14:50.307 --> 14:51.600
Chief Marino.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.895
I want you to get home safely
for the birth of your new child.

14:55.896 --> 14:59.065
Petty Officer Denton, I believe you owe
your wife a honeymoon.

15:00.942 --> 15:03.028
Your country thanks you
for your service.

15:03.153 --> 15:04.738
<i>I</i> thank you for your service.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.699
It's an honor.
Get home safely.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.451
- Thank you, Mr. President.
- Thank you, sir.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.919
How are you feeling, Commander?

15:20.337 --> 15:23.465
Mr. President,
no SEAL has ever been captured

15:23.590 --> 15:26.176
or left behind on a battlefield
dead or alive.

15:26.801 --> 15:31.222
I have zero intention of my team
being an exception to that legacy.

15:31.348 --> 15:34.351
Your team's safety
is my primary concern.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.687
If you have an opportunity
to capture Nassar alive,

15:37.812 --> 15:39.230
that would be optimal.

15:39.356 --> 15:42.567
But if you think it's too risky,
I am ordering you

15:42.692 --> 15:45.862
to take him out
and get your men back safely.

15:46.363 --> 15:48.031
Yes, sir.

15:52.369 --> 15:53.870
Thank you, Commander.

16:05.173 --> 16:07.592
Congresswoman Hookstraten,
thank you for seeing me.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.427
- I'm Agent--
- Agent Wells.

16:09.552 --> 16:11.554
I know who you are.
Please.

16:11.680 --> 16:15.058
I saw you at the medal ceremony
for Congressman MacLeish.

16:15.183 --> 16:18.520
You know, I've often thought
the FBI has to keep quiet

16:18.645 --> 16:21.231
about successes while having
to endure very public failures.

16:21.356 --> 16:24.359
95% of the time
when you guys do it right,

16:24.484 --> 16:27.904
no one knows.
Your heroism is admirable.

16:28.029 --> 16:29.531
When we save lives, it is.

16:30.573 --> 16:33.451
We all feel some responsibility
for not stopping the attack.

16:33.576 --> 16:37.080
But Al-Sakar are the only ones
that are truly at fault.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.416
You know that, right?

16:42.585 --> 16:44.462
I know that you have
a lot on your plate,

16:44.587 --> 16:46.631
but I'd like to request access
to the plans

16:46.756 --> 16:48.967
for the most recent Capitol renovations.

16:49.092 --> 16:50.844
Which are classified.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.929
Yeah, red tape's a bitch.

16:53.054 --> 16:54.848
What are you looking for?

16:55.432 --> 16:57.892
Well, we're investigating
how the bombs got into the building,

16:58.018 --> 17:00.979
and we think they may have used
the construction to do that.

17:01.104 --> 17:02.230
I'll do what I can.

17:03.231 --> 17:05.150
Thank you, Congresswoman.

17:05.275 --> 17:06.608
No, thank you, Agent Wells.

17:19.289 --> 17:20.623
Hey.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.960
They're almost across the Atlantic.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.047
When do they expect to land?

17:28.048 --> 17:30.258
2 hours and 28 minutes.

17:35.764 --> 17:36.598
20 men.

17:37.891 --> 17:41.478
Some of them married fathers.
20 men I've put in harm's way.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.980
I know... that can't be easy.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.484
But then that's the job, right?

17:49.110 --> 17:51.321
There won't be
any easy days here.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.656
No, I guess not.

17:54.657 --> 17:58.495
You're not asking the SEAL team to do
anything they're not trained to do.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.164
You trusted them with this yesterday.

18:01.289 --> 18:03.333
So you should trust them right now.

18:06.961 --> 18:08.505
Tom.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.674
Come to bed, please.

18:18.515 --> 18:21.017
You should get some rest.

18:33.488 --> 18:35.073
You look refreshed, sir.

18:35.198 --> 18:38.409
Two hours sleep is the new eight.
Are they here?

18:38.535 --> 18:39.828
MacLeish is in the Oval.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.246
Hookstraten's running late.

18:41.371 --> 18:42.580
Okay.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.753
Congressman.
So glad to see you here.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.964
Mr. President,
it's an honor, sir, again.

18:51.381 --> 18:53.258
It's actually my first time
in the Oval Office.

18:53.383 --> 18:54.551
What do you think?

18:54.676 --> 18:55.969
Humbling.

18:56.553 --> 18:57.345
Yes.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.140
I have a feeling
that doesn't go away.

19:00.557 --> 19:01.850
- Please.
- Sir.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.226
Mr. President.

19:04.394 --> 19:05.436
Peter?

19:05.562 --> 19:08.022
I didn't expect to see you again so soon.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.274
Hello, Kimble.
I know.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.442
I was wondering
the same thing myself.

19:11.568 --> 19:12.861
Kimble, please take a seat.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.362
Thank you, sir.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.031
Until the governors
appoint their senators

19:17.157 --> 19:18.616
and hold elections
for the House,

19:18.741 --> 19:21.786
you two represent the entire
Congress of the United States.

19:21.911 --> 19:24.747
So I thought it was important
that I invite both of you.

19:24.873 --> 19:28.626
I'm officially notifying you that I have
deployed U.S. troops abroad.

19:28.751 --> 19:31.963
A Navy SEAL team
led by Commander Max Clarkson

19:32.088 --> 19:34.632
will enter the Republic of Algeria

19:34.757 --> 19:37.760
and capture dead or alive Majid Nassar,

19:37.886 --> 19:40.388
leader of the Al-Sakar terrorist group.

19:44.017 --> 19:46.769
Sir, it's the right thing to do.
I completely approve of this action.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.898
He doesn't need our approval, Peter.

19:50.023 --> 19:53.943
He's obliged to tell us. But of course
you have our full support.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.154
Thank you both.

19:56.279 --> 19:59.324
But I wouldn't be doing my job
if I didn't also warn you:

19:59.449 --> 20:03.203
the entire legitimacy of
your presidency depends on this.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.788
If the mission is a success,
you're Reagan.

20:05.914 --> 20:08.166
If it fails, you're Carter,

20:08.291 --> 20:11.419
and Congress
will hold you accountable.

20:12.629 --> 20:15.840
As usual, Kimble,
your support is overwhelming.

20:15.965 --> 20:18.509
Uh, just to be clear,
you're saying if the mission fails,

20:18.635 --> 20:21.429
you'll withdraw your support entirely?

20:21.554 --> 20:23.514
Maybe deny you ever gave it
in the first place,

20:23.640 --> 20:25.183
possibly start an investigation?

20:25.308 --> 20:27.685
So long as we're being communicative.

20:27.810 --> 20:29.103
Thank you, Mr. President.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.231
I'll let you get back to your job.

20:32.815 --> 20:33.900
Coming, Peter?

20:39.447 --> 20:41.157
Sir.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.660
I just want to say...

20:44.077 --> 20:45.036
Godspeed.

20:45.161 --> 20:47.205
Thank you, Congressman.

20:47.330 --> 20:48.456
Thank you.

20:53.253 --> 20:55.546
Sir, I have to point out
we do have an alternative...

20:55.672 --> 20:57.715
for the next Speaker of the House,
I mean.

20:57.840 --> 20:59.717
I don't get to choose
Speaker of the House, Aaron.

20:59.842 --> 21:01.386
No, no, but when the house is seated,

21:01.511 --> 21:03.638
your support
will carry a lot of weight.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.848
Hookstraten won't be
the only senior member.

21:06.474 --> 21:08.101
- MacLeish.
- Yeah.

21:08.685 --> 21:11.271
He just gave you his full support,
no strings attached.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.564
Would you like me to look into it, sir?

21:13.690 --> 21:15.984
I don't see any harm in feeling it out.

21:16.109 --> 21:18.111
- Take Emily, see what he has to say.
- Yes?

21:21.281 --> 21:22.991
Yeah, we'll be right there.

21:23.116 --> 21:26.160
Sir, we have a problem. One of
the SEALs' choppers just went down.

21:26.286 --> 21:27.370
Oh, no.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.003
- Admiral, what's happened?
- Sir.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.922
One of the Black Hawks hit a sandstorm
on descent to the LZ.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.258
Visibility was reduced to zero,

21:40.383 --> 21:42.635
forcing the pilot to perform
a combat landing.

21:43.011 --> 21:46.180
A rollover was averted, but one of the
SEALs was injured in the process, sir.

21:46.306 --> 21:47.765
Petty Officer John Denton.

21:47.890 --> 21:48.766
What's his condition?

21:48.891 --> 21:50.435
Still trying to get
that information, sir.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.853
This is Chernow, Commander.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.604
- Is your team okay?
<i>- Yes, Admiral.</i>

21:53.730 --> 21:56.858
Luckily, Petty Officer Denton
suffered only minor injuries.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.526
<i>Can he go on with the mission?</i>

21:58.651 --> 21:59.777
No, sir.

21:59.902 --> 22:01.904
But we have suitable replacements.

22:02.530 --> 22:04.240
There's no need to alter course.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.617
Commander, I need you to be sure.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.119
<i>Admiral, we're solid.</i>

22:08.244 --> 22:10.621
<i>I would never put my men
in unnecessary danger.</i>

22:10.747 --> 22:12.999
<i>You have to trust me.
Let us do our job.</i>

22:14.751 --> 22:16.586
Green light, Commander. Go.

22:16.711 --> 22:17.920
<i>We'll see you in 24 hours</i>

22:18.046 --> 22:19.380
with one successful body snatch.

22:25.094 --> 22:26.596
All right, just remember,
any questions

22:26.721 --> 22:28.806
involving potential military
action should be deflected.

22:28.931 --> 22:30.099
What military action?

22:30.224 --> 22:31.809
Good job.

22:31.934 --> 22:33.269
General Muñoz was also arrested.

22:33.394 --> 22:35.313
Michigan's Lieutenant Governor
has taken over,

22:35.438 --> 22:37.398
and we're confident
the situation's under control.

22:37.523 --> 22:38.566
Shelly then Brian.

22:38.691 --> 22:39.776
According
to a Pentagon source,

22:39.901 --> 22:43.071
U.S. diplomatic stations in Algiers
have evacuated non-essentials.

22:43.196 --> 22:46.074
Is the White House preparing
military action against Al-Sakar?

22:46.199 --> 22:48.117
No, those stations have planned
to downsize for months now.

22:48.242 --> 22:49.452
It's nothing out of the ordinary.

22:49.577 --> 22:51.162
Come on, Seth.
I talked to my guy.

22:51.287 --> 22:53.664
The Lexington carrier group
has left port for the Mediterranean.

22:53.790 --> 22:55.666
Why else would the Navy
be flexing so much muscle?

22:55.792 --> 22:57.919
As far as I know,
it's part of a routine operation

22:58.044 --> 23:00.004
- to test our battle readiness.
- Give us a break.

23:00.129 --> 23:02.298
All this adds up
to a potential military strike.

23:02.423 --> 23:04.967
What's the real story? You can't
keep pivoting to talking points.

23:05.426 --> 23:07.053
Watch me. Jordan?

23:08.221 --> 23:09.972
- Speaker of the House?
- Mm-hmm.

23:10.306 --> 23:13.267
- You're serious?
- Most importantly, so is the President.

23:13.810 --> 23:15.686
You'd just need
to put your name forward.

23:15.812 --> 23:17.688
With your record and his support,

23:17.814 --> 23:20.149
we think you'd be the obvious choice

23:20.274 --> 23:21.859
for the new members of the House.

23:21.984 --> 23:23.694
And if you're worried about
Congresswoman Hookstraten,

23:23.820 --> 23:25.154
you owe her nothing politically.

23:25.279 --> 23:27.490
Ah, that's got nothing to do with it.

23:29.826 --> 23:32.328
I mean no disrespect,
and I'm honored.

23:32.453 --> 23:33.538
I am.

23:33.663 --> 23:35.832
I just don't want the job.

23:39.419 --> 23:41.295
Uh, your president is asking you.

23:41.421 --> 23:42.547
I know that, and, uh,

23:42.672 --> 23:45.466
he is an honest and a decent man.
He's facing an awesome task,

23:45.591 --> 23:47.301
and there's no one I'd rather serve.

23:48.010 --> 23:51.431
But that's just it.
I-I got into this to serve.

23:52.265 --> 23:53.683
I don't... I don't understand.

23:53.808 --> 23:55.393
Speaker's pure politics.

23:55.518 --> 23:56.727
And, and don't get me wrong.

23:56.853 --> 23:58.062
I-I respect the people

23:58.187 --> 24:00.022
who deftly pull the strings of power.

24:00.148 --> 24:01.315
It's just not me.

24:01.441 --> 24:04.485
I'm not interested in power
for power's sake.

24:04.610 --> 24:07.155
I see.

24:07.655 --> 24:09.907
I don't think you do,
but that's okay.

24:10.032 --> 24:12.535
I had a father
who instilled in me

24:12.660 --> 24:15.913
that there is no higher calling
than to serve your country.

24:16.038 --> 24:18.583
First in uniform,
then in Congress.

24:18.708 --> 24:21.169
I know how it sounds, but, uh...

24:21.294 --> 24:23.880
I mean, I can... I can respect that.
I...

24:26.466 --> 24:28.759
I-I just don't know
what to tell the President.

24:28.885 --> 24:32.930
Well, you tell him I'll support him
in the best way I can,

24:33.055 --> 24:34.432
just not that way.

24:34.557 --> 24:35.892
Not as Speaker.

24:40.313 --> 24:42.940
- Congresswoman.
- Thank you for meeting me.

24:43.065 --> 24:44.775
I have what you asked for.

24:44.901 --> 24:47.945
The last Capitol renovations
took place two-and-a-half months ago.

24:48.070 --> 24:51.574
The upgrades were on several offices
in a first-floor corridor.

24:51.699 --> 24:53.451
And who were the contractors?

24:53.576 --> 24:54.952
Same ones
as we always used...

24:55.077 --> 24:56.412
except one.

24:57.330 --> 25:00.374
A sub contractor that
I've never heard of: Margrove.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.377
Unfortunately,
that company's now defunct.

25:03.503 --> 25:06.589
They worked specifically
on the renovations to room 105.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.133
105?

25:09.258 --> 25:10.801
Well, it might not be relevant,

25:10.927 --> 25:12.929
but that was
a hideaway office, so...

25:13.721 --> 25:16.474
Margrove's workers would've had
to have security clearance, right?

25:16.599 --> 25:19.685
Yes, the names
are in the classified file.

25:22.188 --> 25:25.441
Do you really think these men could be
linked somehow to the bombing?

25:27.109 --> 25:28.319
I do.

25:28.444 --> 25:29.820
There's one condition.

25:29.946 --> 25:32.114
Wherever your investigation leads,

25:32.740 --> 25:34.242
I want to be updated.

25:35.368 --> 25:36.452
Of course.

25:46.462 --> 25:47.797
Hey, you.

25:47.922 --> 25:49.257
- I missed you.
- Oh.

25:49.382 --> 25:51.342
It's so good to see you
outside the Oval hallways.

25:51.467 --> 25:54.512
I know. This place just isn't quite
as conducive to the drop in.

25:54.637 --> 25:55.846
You can say that again.

25:55.972 --> 25:57.014
- Yeah.
- Well, no, tell me.

25:57.139 --> 25:58.266
Start. What?

25:58.391 --> 26:02.562
Well, I wish I was here
on a social... visit.

26:07.483 --> 26:10.611
Yesterday, Aaron asked me
if I knew a Jeffrey Myers.

26:10.736 --> 26:12.029
What?

26:12.154 --> 26:13.197
Why?

26:13.322 --> 26:17.285
Well, you two dated, and now
he's serving time in federal prison.

26:17.410 --> 26:19.453
But that was almost
two decades ago.

26:19.579 --> 26:21.038
Why's he rooting around in that?

26:21.163 --> 26:23.874
He's just doing his job.
Opposition research, most likely,

26:24.000 --> 26:26.294
but a good Chief of Staff
wants to get ahead of anything

26:26.419 --> 26:28.045
that could hurt the President.

26:28.170 --> 26:30.298
Sure, but, uh,
Tom knows everything.

26:30.423 --> 26:33.009
I mean, it couldn't even touch him.

26:34.468 --> 26:36.971
Good. I'll talk to Aaron.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.139
No.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.891
Thank you, but I got it.

26:41.017 --> 26:43.811
Don't even think about it.
I'll talk to him myself.

26:56.032 --> 26:58.075
Sir, the SEALs have secured
the hospital perimeter.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.910
They're about
to enter the building.

27:00.036 --> 27:03.164
We'll be monitoring
the visual feeds from Command Ops.

27:04.040 --> 27:07.126
Sir, I-I can just keep you updated
with any major developments.

27:08.044 --> 27:09.211
No.

27:11.047 --> 27:13.841
I asked these men to go into battle,
risk their lives.

27:14.216 --> 27:16.677
The least I can do
is see it through with them.

27:16.802 --> 27:17.887
Sir.

27:35.321 --> 27:38.240
Perimeter's secure and the snipers
are in place, Mr. President.

27:38.366 --> 27:40.117
Alpha team's proceeding
to the generator.

27:40.242 --> 27:43.663
Gamma is at the hospital rear entrance.

27:46.082 --> 27:48.459
I asked the Congressman to join us.
Peter, sit here.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.044
Thank you, sir.

27:51.712 --> 27:53.923
They're just about
to enter the building.

28:05.226 --> 28:07.478
<i>Alpha team standing by
to blow the generator.</i>

28:07.603 --> 28:09.105
<i>Assault team in place.</i>

28:09.230 --> 28:10.481
<i>On my command.</i>

28:10.606 --> 28:12.066
Breach, breach, breach.

28:19.448 --> 28:21.242
- What's up?
- Lock the door.

28:23.911 --> 28:26.288
Hannah, what's with
the cloak and dagger?

28:30.126 --> 28:31.001
MacLeish.

28:31.127 --> 28:33.337
Hannah, I already told you
you got to let this thing go, all right?

28:33.462 --> 28:35.756
- Unless you have some proof.
- I have it.

28:36.465 --> 28:39.135
I need you to stay,
and I need you to listen.

28:40.803 --> 28:42.805
Gamma assault team is inside.

28:42.930 --> 28:44.306
<i>Gamma team is inside the hospital.</i>

28:47.643 --> 28:49.186
Everyone, get out!

28:49.311 --> 28:50.521
Out, out!

28:50.646 --> 28:52.481
Go, go, go!

28:57.278 --> 28:59.739
Hostile! Hostile!

29:01.907 --> 29:02.742
Take those down.

29:03.325 --> 29:05.327
- Talk to me.
<i>- Upstairs clear.</i>

29:05.953 --> 29:07.455
<i>- Second floor clear.
- Commander,</i>

29:07.580 --> 29:09.957
<i>neither one
of these guys is Mad Hatter.</i>

29:10.332 --> 29:12.042
<i>This is Gamma Zero Six,
first floor secure.</i>

29:12.168 --> 29:13.169
<i>Proceeding to basement.</i>

29:15.421 --> 29:16.547
So what you're telling me

29:16.672 --> 29:19.049
is that room 105
was a hidden office?

29:19.175 --> 29:21.469
Yes, inside the Capitol.
Recently renovated.

29:21.594 --> 29:23.220
All right, and that's important
because...?

29:23.345 --> 29:25.598
Because I went to interview
the men who renovated it.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.309
- This is George Sullivan.
- And what'd he say?

29:28.434 --> 29:31.061
Nothing. He had a heart attack
a month ago. He's dead.

29:31.187 --> 29:33.564
All right, look, with all due respect
to Mr. Sullivan,

29:33.689 --> 29:36.025
I got 1,000 people dead
from this bombing, okay?

29:36.150 --> 29:38.861
So why should I care about
a-a construction worker

29:38.986 --> 29:40.863
- with high cholesterol?
- All right, point taken.

29:40.988 --> 29:42.406
Ask me about Ken Gibson.

29:42.531 --> 29:43.991
Why don't you tell me
about Mr. Gibson?

29:44.116 --> 29:45.201
Car accident two weeks ago.

29:46.368 --> 29:47.787
He's dead, too?

29:55.377 --> 29:57.421
- All these guys are gone?
- Not <i>gone.</i>

29:57.546 --> 29:58.506
Dead.

29:58.631 --> 30:00.883
All eight men
who worked on room 105

30:01.008 --> 30:03.093
where MacLeish was found...
are dead.

30:03.219 --> 30:06.180
All in the last two months
and all accidents or natural causes.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.561
- Clearly, that doesn't sound like a--
- Coincidence?

30:13.020 --> 30:14.021
No.

30:23.405 --> 30:24.949
Hold your fire.

30:25.074 --> 30:26.367
<i>We got a kid down here.</i>

30:27.993 --> 30:29.245
Check that room.

30:31.163 --> 30:32.081
<i>We're clear.</i>

30:33.582 --> 30:35.543
When they go underground,

30:35.668 --> 30:37.711
you can expect the feed
to be interrupted, Mr. President.

30:37.837 --> 30:38.921
Okay.

30:40.422 --> 30:43.926
Admiral, you've done what,
hundreds of these missions?

30:44.051 --> 30:45.427
Does it ever get easier?

30:45.553 --> 30:48.264
No. But you don't want it to, sir.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.106
All right, they were just here.

30:59.441 --> 31:00.860
<i>Mad Hatter's on the move.</i>

31:01.610 --> 31:04.572
So, every single person
that worked on room 105 is dead.

31:04.697 --> 31:06.282
What the hell were they renovating?

31:06.407 --> 31:09.827
That was my question exactly,
so I asked Hector

31:09.952 --> 31:13.330
to recreate 105 from the debris
using the architectural drawings,

31:13.455 --> 31:15.291
and this is what he came back with.

31:15.791 --> 31:17.084
Looks funny, right?

31:17.209 --> 31:19.169
That's because
it's not supposed to be there.

31:19.295 --> 31:20.671
These are reinforced steel,

31:20.796 --> 31:23.424
but the beams are coated
in highly durable elasto-polymer.

31:23.549 --> 31:25.134
And that does what?

31:26.093 --> 31:29.805
It improves air-blast resistance,
rendering it virtually indestructible.

31:30.764 --> 31:32.850
- Are you... Are you saying that...
- Yeah.

31:32.975 --> 31:34.560
They built a bomb shelter...

31:34.977 --> 31:38.480
inside the U.S. Capitol.

31:42.484 --> 31:44.820
Target is close.
Stand by to engage.

31:46.113 --> 31:47.740
Move, move, move, move, move.

31:48.449 --> 31:50.492
Freeze!

31:58.500 --> 31:59.710
Calm down!

32:07.801 --> 32:09.511
We have eyes on Mad Hatter.

32:09.637 --> 32:11.013
That's Majid Nassar.

32:11.138 --> 32:12.681
<i>So, what are you saying?</i>

32:12.806 --> 32:15.476
MacLeish's survival was planned?

32:15.601 --> 32:16.977
This is not theory anymore, Jason.

32:17.102 --> 32:19.813
This is not a figment of my imagination.

32:19.939 --> 32:21.565
During the State of the Union address,

32:21.690 --> 32:23.817
the Capitol blew up and everyone died.

32:23.943 --> 32:25.694
Everyone except one man.

32:25.819 --> 32:28.280
<i>They really want you
to put down your guns.</i>

32:36.038 --> 32:38.749
They said put down your guns!

32:49.551 --> 32:52.012
- What the hell was that?
- We're working on that right now, sir.

32:52.137 --> 32:54.098
I've been
in combat before, sir.

32:54.223 --> 32:56.517
It could just be a flashbang
to disorient the enemy.

32:56.642 --> 32:57.518
Mr. President,

32:57.643 --> 33:00.562
we've currently lost all contact
with our SEAL team, sir.

33:01.397 --> 33:03.440
<i>You have to see how big this is.</i>

33:03.565 --> 33:06.568
That there was a plan to make sure
that only one person survived:

33:06.694 --> 33:08.278
him.

33:08.404 --> 33:10.197
Congressman Peter MacLeish.

33:11.407 --> 33:12.574
Jason.

33:15.577 --> 33:17.121
He's in on it.

33:20.833 --> 33:22.292
Come on.

33:22.418 --> 33:24.086
Come on.

33:32.428 --> 33:35.723
Still haven't reestablished
contact with the SEALs yet, sir.

33:35.848 --> 33:37.474
We may have to prepare
for the worst.

33:37.599 --> 33:40.144
This is my fault. I should've listened
to General Cochrane.

33:40.269 --> 33:41.770
I should've bombed him
when I had a shot.

33:41.895 --> 33:43.939
There's no shame
in exhausting all possibilities.

33:44.606 --> 33:45.941
Mr. President.

33:47.109 --> 33:48.777
We have Majid Nassar.

33:50.279 --> 33:51.447
That means they made it.

33:52.781 --> 33:54.658
They're alive.

33:54.783 --> 33:56.160
They're alive!

33:56.285 --> 33:57.327
Congratulations, sir.

33:57.453 --> 33:59.079
Thank you. Oh, my God.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.082
They made it!
And we got Nassar.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.167
Got the bastard, sir.

34:05.961 --> 34:07.463
Mr. President.

34:08.255 --> 34:09.422
Congratulations, Admiral.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.634
There's been one casualty, sir.

34:14.469 --> 34:17.973
SEAL team leader Max Clarkson
was shot and killed in action.

34:19.891 --> 34:21.268
Oh, no.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.063
Oh, no.

34:39.078 --> 34:41.080
There were seven children
in the room.

34:41.663 --> 34:43.956
They were being held at gunpoint
by the terrorists.

34:44.083 --> 34:45.333
It was a massacre
waiting to happen.

34:46.502 --> 34:48.170
One of the terrorists opened fire.

34:48.295 --> 34:50.130
Commander Clarkson
shielded two of the children

34:50.255 --> 34:51.547
with his own body

34:51.672 --> 34:55.094
while the rest of the SEALs
returned fire, killing the terrorists.

34:56.969 --> 34:59.348
Clarkson took eight rounds
to the back, one to the neck.

34:59.473 --> 35:01.100
He was killed instantly.

35:02.184 --> 35:05.312
The two children that he shielded,
they survived.

35:06.939 --> 35:09.358
Because of him, we managed
to capture Nassar alive

35:09.483 --> 35:10.984
with no civilian casualties.

35:11.110 --> 35:13.529
- But that's exactly what you wanted.
- No.

35:14.530 --> 35:15.531
No.

35:17.116 --> 35:18.784
One of our men died.

35:19.868 --> 35:22.079
And he's dead
because of the orders I gave him.

35:22.204 --> 35:24.581
But you made
the best decision you could

35:24.706 --> 35:26.416
with the information you had, Tom.

35:26.542 --> 35:28.836
Even he said there was
a 50/50 shot at success.

35:28.961 --> 35:32.005
- I should've waited for better odds.
- Which may never have come.

35:32.131 --> 35:34.091
Tom, you took the country
to war today

35:34.216 --> 35:36.260
because you thought
it was the right decision.

35:36.385 --> 35:38.554
Casualties are inevitable.

35:45.227 --> 35:46.603
I still don't get it.

35:46.728 --> 35:48.438
MacLeish says
he just wants to serve,

35:48.564 --> 35:49.773
but he's not interested in power.

35:49.898 --> 35:51.441
Not for power's sake, he said.

35:51.567 --> 35:55.362
We should have Bethesda send over
MacLeish's CT and MRI scans.

35:55.988 --> 35:57.281
He said he wasn't raised that way.

35:57.406 --> 36:00.617
He sounded like a man
with no political ambitions whatsoever.

36:00.742 --> 36:02.619
Who moves to D.C.
and doesn't want power?

36:02.744 --> 36:03.912
Me.

36:05.247 --> 36:06.748
Please, sit.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.878
I didn't move to Washington, D.C.
for power.

36:11.003 --> 36:12.880
But you have to admit it's unusual

36:13.005 --> 36:14.923
that MacLeish would turn down
Speaker of the House.

36:15.757 --> 36:17.759
- What?
- You haven't heard?

36:19.595 --> 36:20.762
No, I didn't.

36:21.388 --> 36:22.556
It's been a long day.

36:31.273 --> 36:32.608
What did he say?

36:32.733 --> 36:35.611
The man said
he came to Washington to serve.

36:36.403 --> 36:39.656
He doesn't think he could do it
as Speaker of the House.

36:39.781 --> 36:40.866
Sounds familiar.

36:41.867 --> 36:42.868
He's right.

36:45.037 --> 36:46.788
Maybe we offered him
the wrong job.

36:51.043 --> 36:53.212
What about the Vice Presidency?

37:04.473 --> 37:05.724
Mrs. Kirkman?

37:07.559 --> 37:08.769
I'm sorry.

37:08.894 --> 37:11.021
I didn't expect anybody in so late.

37:11.146 --> 37:14.316
I hear you've been asking around
about Jeffrey Myers.

37:15.817 --> 37:18.320
Well, Emily's got a better
poker face than I thought.

37:19.655 --> 37:22.449
She said it came up
in your opposition research.

37:22.574 --> 37:23.533
Yeah.

37:23.659 --> 37:27.287
So you know we had a relationship,
and you know he's in prison.

37:27.412 --> 37:28.664
I do.

37:29.665 --> 37:30.916
And so does Tom.

37:32.459 --> 37:34.461
Every detail.

37:38.465 --> 37:40.342
It is not a personal issue for us,

37:41.093 --> 37:44.096
so I don't see why
it should be a political one.

37:45.264 --> 37:46.723
It shouldn't be...

37:46.848 --> 37:49.643
except Jeffrey Myers
has been telling everyone

37:49.768 --> 37:54.147
in his federal prison in Pennsylvania
that he's the father of your son.

37:58.485 --> 38:00.112
Ma'am?

38:01.488 --> 38:02.531
Mrs. Kirkman.

38:06.493 --> 38:09.538
Ma'am, does...
Does Leo know...

38:10.872 --> 38:13.333
that the President
might not be his father?

38:30.642 --> 38:32.519
You haven't said a word.

38:33.145 --> 38:35.022
What the hell do you want me to say?

38:35.147 --> 38:37.899
- That you believe me.
- Of course I believe you.

38:38.233 --> 38:39.943
I didn't want to, but yeah, I do.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.361
Who else have you told?

38:41.862 --> 38:42.696
No one.

38:44.239 --> 38:45.782
Why? What are you thinking?

38:45.907 --> 38:47.117
These people, whoever they are,

38:47.242 --> 38:50.162
they killed almost every senior member
of the federal government

38:50.537 --> 38:53.040
and tied up any loose ends
before we even knew there were any.

38:53.165 --> 38:55.292
So, we need to find out
the how and the why--

38:55.417 --> 38:57.544
Yes, we do,
but we don't know who to trust.

38:57.669 --> 39:00.380
So you cannot say anything
to anybody.

39:00.922 --> 39:02.132
Do you understand me?

39:02.257 --> 39:03.550
No one.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.423
Mr. President.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.926
I'm sorry. I had no idea
you were here, sir.

39:47.594 --> 39:50.764
I wanted to pay my respects
to Commander Clarkson.

39:53.975 --> 39:56.228
Thank you for your incredible bravery.

39:56.645 --> 39:58.230
Just doing my job, sir.

40:00.273 --> 40:02.818
You know, Max wasn't even
supposed to be in the raid.

40:04.444 --> 40:06.822
He was supposed to coordinate
the mission off site.

40:07.823 --> 40:09.783
But when Denton got injured
in the chopper crash,

40:09.908 --> 40:12.661
Max took his place to ensure
the operation would go as planned.

40:14.621 --> 40:16.832
It's because of him
none of those kids were hurt...

40:17.833 --> 40:20.293
and I get to see
the birth of my first child.

40:22.796 --> 40:25.507
I should've waited
for a better window of opportunity.

40:25.632 --> 40:26.675
Don't, sir.

40:28.635 --> 40:31.430
Feel guilty?
A little part of me does as well.

40:32.264 --> 40:35.350
But I also feel honor, respect,

40:35.475 --> 40:37.436
because that's what
this man deserves.

40:38.645 --> 40:40.647
That's how he needs to be remembered.

40:42.023 --> 40:44.734
Don't ever question your decision,
Mr. President.

40:44.860 --> 40:46.570
Because none of us ever did,

40:46.695 --> 40:48.655
especially Max.

40:49.656 --> 40:51.324
I'll leave you to it, sir.
