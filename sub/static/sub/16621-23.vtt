WEBVTT

00:22.322 --> 00:24.089
Nitro, come here.
Come here, boy.

00:30.430 --> 00:32.431
(liquid drops)

00:39.106 --> 00:40.672
(gasps)

00:49.282 --> 00:51.283
¶ ¶

01:14.774 --> 01:17.576
Are you ready?

01:17.611 --> 01:19.111
Yeah.
To that red car
up there.

01:19.146 --> 01:20.746
All right.
Let's do it.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.554
What are you doing?

01:29.589 --> 01:31.323
You said to the red car. I win.

01:33.293 --> 01:34.593
I changed my mind.

01:34.628 --> 01:36.161
In the middle
of the race?

01:36.196 --> 01:38.196
I want to get back
to the house,

01:38.231 --> 01:39.631
maybe take a nice,

01:39.666 --> 01:41.700
hot... shower.

01:41.735 --> 01:43.902
Hot shower, really?
What's up?

01:43.937 --> 01:46.305
Thought you was
a long-distance man.

01:47.374 --> 01:48.507
(laughs)

01:48.542 --> 01:51.309
Oh, hell yeah.

01:51.344 --> 01:54.446
And what are the seven
characteristics of life?

01:54.481 --> 01:56.615
Order,

01:56.650 --> 01:59.151
reproduction, growth,
energy processing.

01:59.186 --> 02:00.085
Hey, angel.

02:00.121 --> 02:01.887
All right, we're gonna
be late for the bus.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.655
Give me three more.
Mom, I know.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.357
Regulation,

02:05.392 --> 02:07.325
response to
the environment, and...

02:07.360 --> 02:09.561
And I would love for somebody
to make me some eggs.

02:09.596 --> 02:10.595
I mean, I'm only

02:10.631 --> 02:13.198
saving the world.
Dad, if you
don't mind,

02:13.233 --> 02:13.932
it's the bio final.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.534
Sorry, sorry.

02:15.569 --> 02:18.737
Your smoothie
is in the fridge.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.172
Mom, focus.

02:20.207 --> 02:21.339
You focus.

02:21.374 --> 02:22.440
And...

02:22.475 --> 02:24.609
evolutionary
adaptation.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.344
Boom.
Boom is right.

02:26.379 --> 02:27.712
Good job.
(phone vibrates)

02:27.747 --> 02:31.216
All right,
let me see.

02:31.251 --> 02:32.818
Good morning, Henrietta.

02:34.554 --> 02:35.787
Okay.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.190
Got it.

02:38.225 --> 02:39.925
MICHELLE:
Everything okay?

02:39.960 --> 02:43.461
All good.

02:43.496 --> 02:44.763
You feel like working today?

02:44.798 --> 02:46.364
MICHELLE:
Sure.

02:46.399 --> 02:47.833
What is it?

02:48.768 --> 02:51.803
Zhrov wants to give up
some information.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.705
In exchange
for a reduced sentence.

02:53.740 --> 02:56.608
But he only wants to
speak to you.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.778
He needs a familiar face,
someone he can trust.

02:59.813 --> 03:00.879
We'll drop Kamran off

03:00.914 --> 03:03.548
at the bus stop, then we'll
head over to Oakville.

03:03.583 --> 03:05.284
Sounds good.

03:07.854 --> 03:11.190
(guard speaking indistinctly
over loudspeaker)

03:15.362 --> 03:16.561
MICHELLE: All right,
this is everything

03:16.596 --> 03:18.663
the CIA has on Zhrov.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.733
He's always maintained
deep ties to the Kremlin.

03:21.768 --> 03:22.600
When I was undercover,

03:22.636 --> 03:24.836
he was handling
all of Isaak Sidorov's

03:24.871 --> 03:25.937
arms-dealing
operations.

03:25.972 --> 03:28.473
SAM: Oh, yeah.
I remember.

03:28.508 --> 03:29.741
Wasn't this Sidorov guy
in love with you?

03:31.311 --> 03:32.277
Whatever happened to him?

03:32.312 --> 03:33.745
You killed him.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.914
That's right.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.682
My bad.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.017
(chuckles)

03:39.052 --> 03:42.387
Hetty say what kind of
information Zhrov has?

03:42.422 --> 03:44.756
She said it's related
to nuclear materials

03:44.791 --> 03:45.824
moving out of Russia.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.759
But you got to figure
this guy will say anything

03:47.794 --> 03:49.527
to get a sentence
reduction.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.829
Mm-hmm.

03:50.864 --> 03:54.399
Well, if he's lying,

03:54.434 --> 03:55.901
I'll know it.

03:56.936 --> 03:59.304
Let's go.

04:03.843 --> 04:06.778
It's a very large amount
of highly enriched uranium.

04:06.813 --> 04:07.645
MICHELLE:
Iran is the buyer.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.981
Who exactly in Russia
is the seller?

04:10.016 --> 04:12.384
The dealer is a...

04:12.419 --> 04:14.352
is a guy
named Belanov.

04:14.387 --> 04:15.553
Who is he for real?

04:15.588 --> 04:18.323
He is an FSB agent.

04:18.358 --> 04:22.327
Kremlin is getting material
into Iran to either blow up

04:22.362 --> 04:23.828
the U.S. nuclear deal or...

04:23.863 --> 04:25.530
When the treaty expires,

04:25.565 --> 04:27.599
Iran can quickly construct
nuclear weapons.

04:27.634 --> 04:29.501
ZHROV: I'm taking
a huge chance

04:29.536 --> 04:30.969
telling you this.

04:31.004 --> 04:32.871
I want to be compensated.

04:32.906 --> 04:34.339
SAM:
We'll vet the story.

04:34.374 --> 04:35.774
If it checks out,

04:35.809 --> 04:37.942
the federal prosecutor will be
in touch with your lawyer.

04:37.977 --> 04:39.911
Okay?

04:39.946 --> 04:41.613
Okay.

04:43.650 --> 04:45.050
Thanks.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.352
Okay, so the CIA
is aware of Belanov.

04:47.387 --> 04:48.353
Mm-hmm.

04:48.388 --> 04:51.389
They think he is an FSB agent.

04:51.424 --> 04:53.858
Well, let's see how
the story checks out.

04:53.893 --> 04:55.060
Yeah.

04:59.032 --> 05:03.868
(sighs) With Kamran going to the
military academy next year...

05:03.903 --> 05:05.804
You want to go back
to field work.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.939
I don't know.

05:07.974 --> 05:10.608
Two Hannas saving the world?

05:10.643 --> 05:11.676
(phone rings)

05:11.711 --> 05:12.810
Hey.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.879
CALLEN: LAPD needs us to
check out a crime scene ASAP.

05:14.914 --> 05:15.713
They think it might be

05:15.748 --> 05:17.482
a revenge attack
on a naval officer.

05:17.517 --> 05:18.683
I can come get you.

05:18.718 --> 05:19.884
How far are you?

05:19.919 --> 05:22.087
Well, according to Waze...

05:22.122 --> 05:23.855
I'm pretty close, actually.

05:23.890 --> 05:26.524
Got to go.

05:26.559 --> 05:27.525
MICHELLE:
All right.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.060
He's always safer
when I drive.

05:29.095 --> 05:30.795
Take care of him.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.530
I always do.

05:32.565 --> 05:34.532
You better.

05:34.567 --> 05:35.900
Don't hurt my car.

05:35.935 --> 05:37.469
See you tonight.

05:42.909 --> 05:44.743
(sighs)

05:47.080 --> 05:50.082
Words translate to
"the revenge has begun."

05:52.051 --> 05:54.552
How do you know
this guy was Navy?

05:54.587 --> 05:55.820
CALLEN:
Sam.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.622
They found an I.D.
on the body.

05:57.657 --> 05:59.090
Okay. Who is it?

05:59.125 --> 06:00.926
It's Tom Olsen.

06:04.998 --> 06:07.732
(sighs)

06:07.767 --> 06:09.067
I'm sorry.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.135
We'd like to
ask you

06:10.170 --> 06:12.637
a couple questions,
but if you need some time...

06:13.673 --> 06:15.173
Nah, go ahead.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.143
You guys were
SEAL teammates, yeah?

06:18.178 --> 06:19.844
Yeah.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.112
Seven years.

06:21.147 --> 06:23.448
He works just a few
blocks from here.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.818
Has anyone notified his wife?

06:26.853 --> 06:28.553
It's in process.

06:28.588 --> 06:30.088
Why don't you take a minute.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.090
Was a good man.

06:34.861 --> 06:36.194
Like a brother.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.096
It is nice to know
how you feel about me.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.098
(laughs)

06:40.133 --> 06:42.200
Tom, you're alive.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.036
You scared the hell out of me.
Come here. Mmm.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.138
TOM: Well, think
how Carol felt

06:47.173 --> 06:48.139
when she got
the phone call.

06:48.174 --> 06:50.442
I had to come up here to
see what was going on.

06:50.477 --> 06:51.810
You're sure this is Mr. Olsen?

06:51.845 --> 06:54.112
Yes, this is definitely
Mr. Olsen. Absolutely.

06:54.147 --> 06:56.714
That supposed to be me?

06:56.749 --> 06:57.782
MAYNE:
Sorry.

06:57.817 --> 07:00.118
Found a driver's license
and passport on the body.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.621
Six weeks ago,
I took the dog for a walk

07:03.656 --> 07:05.457
and someone broke in,
took a camera,

07:05.492 --> 07:07.025
a driver's license
and my passport.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.894
Okay. Let me get
everyone up to speed.

07:09.929 --> 07:11.763
Okay.
Excuse me.

07:11.798 --> 07:12.997
(sighs)

07:13.032 --> 07:14.098
CALLEN:
Arabic writing?

07:14.133 --> 07:16.101
A Navy SEAL?

07:17.136 --> 07:18.870
This guy was targeted.

07:18.905 --> 07:22.040
Somebody thought he was you.

07:22.075 --> 07:23.475
I don't know.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.543
It doesn't say I'm
a SEAL on the I.D.

07:25.578 --> 07:27.912
There's nothing in the
house that says I'm a SEAL.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.948
Also, why would they
fake your death

07:29.983 --> 07:32.116
if they knew it'd be
found out so quickly?

07:32.151 --> 07:34.085
Navy SEAL...

07:34.120 --> 07:37.155
Someone knew they'd get
NCIS's attention.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.525
TOM:
Do you think

07:40.560 --> 07:41.993
it's to draw you guys out here?

07:42.028 --> 07:44.028
I'll go you one better.

07:44.063 --> 07:47.699
They knew Tom was your teammate,
he was a close friend.

07:47.734 --> 07:50.101
That specifically,
it would draw you out.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.604
Since the mole, my family's been
in a secure location.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.974
Now, on the day Michelle
comes out of hiding

07:56.009 --> 07:57.876
to speak to Zhrov, this happens?

07:57.911 --> 07:59.478
It would guarantee
you wouldn't be home.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.081
What's going on?

08:03.116 --> 08:04.782
(line ringing)
Hopefully nothing.

08:04.817 --> 08:06.084
(phone rings)

08:06.119 --> 08:08.720
(alarm keypad beeping)

08:08.755 --> 08:13.492
(phone ringing)

08:15.295 --> 08:18.196
It's been less than an hour
and I already miss you.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.163
SAM:
Hey,

08:19.198 --> 08:20.565
I may be a little paranoid,

08:20.600 --> 08:22.200
but I think
when you spoke to Zhrov,

08:22.235 --> 08:23.268
you may have been compromised.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.170
Somebody was using Zhrov
to find me?

08:26.205 --> 08:27.805
I'm not sure, but I think

08:27.840 --> 08:29.173
you should get out of the house.

08:29.208 --> 08:31.576
I'm just grabbing my gun
and a burn phone.

08:31.611 --> 08:33.645
Okay, do it quickly.
Stay on the line with me.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.813
(glass shatters)
Sam, someone's in the house!

08:35.848 --> 08:37.081
Get LAPD to my house, now!

08:37.116 --> 08:38.816
Somebody's inside!
Michelle?

08:38.851 --> 08:40.285
Michelle?

08:45.124 --> 08:46.258
(keypad beeps)

08:48.261 --> 08:49.928
LAPD's gonna be
three minutes out.

08:51.130 --> 08:52.931
(box unlocks)
(screams)

08:53.600 --> 08:54.833
(grunts)
(groans)

09:00.039 --> 09:01.239
Move, move!

09:13.920 --> 09:15.954
(tires screech)

09:19.025 --> 09:20.825
My house.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.730
FBI AGENT:
Agent Hanna,

09:25.765 --> 09:27.332
we need to speak to you.
Come with me.

09:30.637 --> 09:32.236
Have your children been secured?

09:32.271 --> 09:35.273
Already done; they're en route
to an undisclosed location.

09:35.308 --> 09:36.808
I checked my security
cams remotely.

09:36.843 --> 09:39.811
We already I.D.'d
the suspects' van.

09:39.846 --> 09:41.713
That's what we need.
Send us footage.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.247
Already did. Put out a BOLO.

09:43.282 --> 09:44.682
Go, do it.
Yes, sir.

09:44.717 --> 09:45.716
All right, setting up
a command post here.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.352
We'll be coordinating
with your operation center.

09:47.387 --> 09:48.886
You've got as many men
as you need.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.089
Thank you.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.290
Eric?
ERIC: Hey, Sam.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.092
I'm not seeing
the black Ford van

09:54.127 --> 09:58.029
on any cameras once it's about
one block north of your house.

09:58.064 --> 09:59.797
Okay. If they going north,

09:59.832 --> 10:02.066
there's a good chance they're
trying to make it to the 405.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.335
From there, they can get
to the 110 if they want.

10:04.370 --> 10:04.969
Eric, are there

10:05.004 --> 10:06.337
any routes to the freeway

10:06.372 --> 10:07.405
that could use back alleys?

10:07.440 --> 10:09.941
Uh, there is one that uses
exclusively back alleys,

10:09.976 --> 10:13.277
but the cameras
are all closed-circuit.

10:13.312 --> 10:15.046
We need footage
from those cameras.

10:15.081 --> 10:16.681
On it.

10:16.716 --> 10:17.815
Sending you the addresses.

10:17.850 --> 10:20.018
Hey. We don't have
time for warrants.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.986
I'm not worried about
prosecuting this.

10:22.021 --> 10:23.321
I need to find my wife.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.190
Whatever it takes.

10:28.161 --> 10:31.262
(sighs)
I have a lot of enemies, G.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.998
Michelle hasn't been
an active agent in 12 years.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.333
This is about me.

10:36.369 --> 10:38.002
It's the mole?

10:38.037 --> 10:40.371
Did we miss somebody?

10:40.406 --> 10:41.939
I don't know.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.008
But this all starts with Zhrov.

10:44.043 --> 10:46.044
He's the one
that exposed Michelle.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.285
Oh, so now you
only talk to us

10:54.320 --> 10:55.753
when they have
guards in the room?

10:55.788 --> 10:56.854
What's up with that?

10:56.889 --> 10:58.189
What do you need?

10:58.224 --> 11:00.191
Who paid you to
contact NCIS?

11:00.226 --> 11:01.359
Nobody.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.461
Did everything
I tell you check out?

11:03.496 --> 11:06.130
I don't have time for this.
My wife was kidnapped.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.966
Who told you to ask for her?

11:09.001 --> 11:11.035
I ask for her
'cause I knew her.

11:11.070 --> 11:13.438
I spent months with her
when she was undercover.

11:13.473 --> 11:16.974
She questioned me
when I was arrested.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.242
We're gonna ask you
this one more time.

11:18.277 --> 11:22.780
Who paid you to bring CIA Agent
Michelle Hanna to this prison?

11:22.815 --> 11:24.215
Who am I supposed to call?

11:24.250 --> 11:25.783
I trusted her

11:25.818 --> 11:26.517
'cause I knew her.

11:26.552 --> 11:28.886
Give me a name!
Give me a name!

11:28.921 --> 11:30.154
That's all I need.

11:30.189 --> 11:31.055
He's not hurting him.
Let him answer.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.223
Nobody paid me!

11:32.258 --> 11:33.124
That's a lie!

11:33.159 --> 11:35.126
We know you set my
wife up to be here.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.494
It was not.
I'm telling you the truth.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.062
Believe me.

11:38.097 --> 11:39.164
GUARD:
Get off him!

11:42.201 --> 11:44.001
CALLEN:
Maybe you didn't know

11:44.036 --> 11:45.169
where this was headed
when you signed up.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.904
You give us a name
now, it's gonna make

11:46.939 --> 11:48.339
a huge difference how
this plays out for you.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.274
SAM: If something happens
to my wife, you're gonna be

11:50.309 --> 11:52.310
looking over your shoulder
for the rest of your life!

11:52.345 --> 11:54.078
Get me out.
(gags)

11:54.113 --> 11:56.280
You feel that?
(gagging)

11:56.315 --> 11:58.149
That's your larynx
getting crushed.

11:58.184 --> 12:01.252
I crack it, it's 50-50 they get
a trach tube in you in time.

12:01.287 --> 12:02.420
Who paid you, huh?

12:02.455 --> 12:04.355
That's enough.
Give me a name!

12:04.390 --> 12:05.457
(gasps)

12:07.126 --> 12:09.094
(siren wailing)

12:17.503 --> 12:18.803
Camera.

12:24.844 --> 12:27.178
(helicopter whirring)

12:27.213 --> 12:29.380
Can I help you?
Owner or manager here?

12:29.415 --> 12:31.015
You can call the
number on the sign.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.250
What the hell's
going on out here?

12:32.285 --> 12:34.085
There was a kidnapping.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.119
Listen, you got
surveillance cameras.

12:35.154 --> 12:36.788
We'd love to have
access to those.

12:36.823 --> 12:37.689
I wish I could help you.

12:37.724 --> 12:38.623
You're gonna have
to call the number.

12:38.658 --> 12:40.258
Sir, this is a kidnapping.
If we could just

12:40.293 --> 12:41.993
look at the-- sir?
Sorry.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.196
What do you got?

12:45.231 --> 12:47.265
I got nothing.
No one answers the phone.

12:50.036 --> 12:51.136
How much cash you got?

12:53.239 --> 12:55.239
(cash shuffling)

12:55.274 --> 12:56.440
(banging on door)

12:56.475 --> 12:57.809
(door unlocks)

12:57.844 --> 12:59.343
Five minutes with
the hard drives

12:59.378 --> 13:00.945
attached to those cameras.

13:00.980 --> 13:02.013
That's illegal.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.147
I understand that.

13:03.182 --> 13:04.382
No one has to know.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.385
Five minutes.

13:12.992 --> 13:15.193
Here it is.
Thank you.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.231
Five minutes.

13:20.266 --> 13:21.432
I won't need that long.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.267
Eric, you should be seeing this.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.136
ERIC:
Got it. Downloading now.

13:27.406 --> 13:30.241
They must have followed you and
Michelle home from the prison,

13:30.276 --> 13:32.543
but we still can't find them
on any nearby traffic cams.

13:32.578 --> 13:34.212
Kensi and Deeks, however,
did find the van

13:34.247 --> 13:35.446
on a warehouse
security camera,

13:35.481 --> 13:38.216
headed north in the
alley behind Hawthorne.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.218
They're headed to the 405.
Uh, no, I checked.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.886
I didn't find them
on either of the onramps.

13:41.921 --> 13:43.154
Check it again.

13:43.189 --> 13:44.422
SAM: Is this still
the only footage

13:44.457 --> 13:46.224
you have of the van
once it left my house?

13:46.259 --> 13:47.058
Hold on.

13:47.093 --> 13:47.692
What?

13:47.727 --> 13:49.460
We're getting a video call

13:49.495 --> 13:50.595
from an international number.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.230
ERIC: Eh, it's not
international.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.931
It's being bounced
so we can't trace it.

13:53.966 --> 13:55.300
Bring it up.
ERIC: Okay.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.636
Oh, my God.
Trace it.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.338
Trying.

14:03.309 --> 14:05.042
MAN (voice scrambled):
We're asking for the release

14:05.077 --> 14:07.011
of Tahir Khaled from prison.

14:07.046 --> 14:10.047
In exchange, Michelle Hanna
will be released.

14:10.082 --> 14:13.284
I'm gonna find every single
person involved with this,

14:13.319 --> 14:15.152
and I'm gonna make it
my life's work

14:15.187 --> 14:16.320
to hunt you down.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.089
Sam, is that you?

14:18.124 --> 14:19.357
Michelle, you can hear me?

14:19.392 --> 14:20.992
Are you okay?

14:21.027 --> 14:22.260
MAN:
You are wasting time.

14:22.295 --> 14:25.363
The room you are looking at
is airtight.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.531
Release Tahir Khaled,
or watch your wife

14:27.566 --> 14:30.235
suffocate to death, Sam Hanna.

14:41.280 --> 14:43.014
Can you trace the signal?

14:43.049 --> 14:44.348
Eric?

14:44.383 --> 14:46.217
Uh, he's routing the signal
through different IPs.

14:46.252 --> 14:48.319
Every few seconds, it changes
to a new signal path.

14:48.354 --> 14:49.287
MICHELLE:
Talk to Zhrov.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.956
See who paid him.

14:51.991 --> 14:53.524
We tried. He won't talk.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.159
Work him. Try again.

14:55.194 --> 14:56.294
SAM:
Okay, I will.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.929
But listen to me.

14:57.964 --> 14:59.363
Did you see anything that
could help us

14:59.398 --> 15:00.364
locate you?

15:00.399 --> 15:04.001
They put a hood on me.

15:04.036 --> 15:06.938
Do you have any idea about why
they're letting us communicate?

15:06.973 --> 15:08.006
CALLEN:
No.

15:08.041 --> 15:11.275
But did you hear anything?
Boats, trains, traffic?

15:11.310 --> 15:13.477
There was something, I...

15:13.512 --> 15:15.546
I can't figure it out.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.481
Try to remember.
I was trying to

15:17.516 --> 15:18.716
stay conscious
and count the time,

15:18.751 --> 15:20.318
so I'd see how far we went.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.286
How long do you think
you were driving?

15:22.321 --> 15:24.155
I'm estimating about 90 minutes.

15:24.190 --> 15:25.056
That would track.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.357
Took the kidnappers
two and a half hours

15:26.392 --> 15:27.391
to make contact.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.493
Get a search radius.
Okay.

15:29.528 --> 15:30.694
So, 90 minutes.

15:30.729 --> 15:33.464
How fast do we want to say
the kidnappers are traveling?

15:33.499 --> 15:35.733
SAM: As fast as they could go
without getting a ticket.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.468
Call it 75 miles an hour.

15:37.503 --> 15:38.670
ERIC: All right,
doing the math.

15:40.673 --> 15:43.140
ERIC: Well, half
the area's water.

15:43.175 --> 15:45.209
That's 20,000 square miles.

15:45.244 --> 15:47.211
KENSI:
That's too big an area.

15:47.246 --> 15:48.212
Okay, where the hell is Hetty?

15:48.247 --> 15:49.680
In her office.

15:49.715 --> 15:52.283
Ah. All right, Michelle...

15:53.285 --> 15:54.452
try to stay calm.

15:54.487 --> 15:58.456
I am, I am. I'm good.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.758
What are the dimensions
of the room you're in?

16:00.793 --> 16:04.128
(sighs)
Um, I estimate about...

16:04.163 --> 16:06.431
six by eight by seven feet.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.401
We're gonna find you.

16:11.437 --> 16:13.104
Send this feed to the FBI.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.405
See if they can
make anything out of it.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.673
ERIC:
Yeah.

16:17.743 --> 16:19.410
Hetty,

16:19.445 --> 16:20.745
you got to
give me access

16:20.780 --> 16:21.779
to Zhrov again.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.247
He's the key
to all of this.

16:23.282 --> 16:24.415
Well, I've tried that,

16:24.450 --> 16:27.385
but he's surrounded
by lawyers now.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.619
Then get me in to see Tahir.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.054
I was in the middle

16:30.089 --> 16:31.689
of doing that when I found this.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.261
Tahir was transferred
to Oakville?

16:37.296 --> 16:39.263
That's the same prison
as Zhrov.

16:39.298 --> 16:40.698
SAM: So they found out
who each other were,

16:40.733 --> 16:42.366
and put this whole thing
together.

16:42.401 --> 16:44.335
I'll try to arrange it. Go.

16:45.371 --> 16:46.337
Tell Tahir

16:46.372 --> 16:48.439
speaking with us
is a condition of his release.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.575
Michelle, what can you tell us
about the room you're in?

16:51.610 --> 16:55.312
I'm pretty sure it's a
refrigerator or a freezer.

16:55.347 --> 16:57.381
But it's not
turned on, though.

16:57.416 --> 16:59.550
I-I'm not cold,
it's-it's...

16:59.585 --> 17:01.252
It's getting
hotter, actually.

17:01.287 --> 17:02.386
ERIC:
A unit that size

17:02.421 --> 17:03.687
would be in a large restaurant

17:03.722 --> 17:04.488
or hotel.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.323
Yeah, maybe a school
or a university.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.192
It's got to be somewhere
that's not used anymore.

17:08.227 --> 17:09.693
There can't be anybody around.
That's good, Michelle.

17:09.728 --> 17:10.628
That narrows it down.

17:10.663 --> 17:11.696
Let's find all
those places

17:11.731 --> 17:13.697
within the search area;
we come up with a list.

17:13.732 --> 17:14.965
We divvy it up between
NCIS and FBI.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.268
We get every available agent,
we get 'em knocking on doors.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.336
We do it now.
We're gonna start on
the outside of the circle,

17:19.371 --> 17:21.272
work our way back
toward Sam's house.
Send that first address

17:21.307 --> 17:23.340
to my phone.
Michelle, hold on.
We're coming for you.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.341
Hurry.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.077
(gate buzzes)

17:34.186 --> 17:35.586
(gate closes)

17:35.621 --> 17:37.555
Hello, Sam.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.124
Seems like a real public place
to have a conversation.

17:40.159 --> 17:41.859
You scared to be
in a room with me?

17:41.894 --> 17:44.361
(chuckles)

17:44.396 --> 17:45.763
Can you blame me?

17:47.466 --> 17:49.200
We have a history, you and I.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.301
You really think
you're getting out of here?

17:50.336 --> 17:54.739
I gather somebody has taken
your beautiful wife...

17:56.375 --> 17:57.575
...and are asking for

17:57.610 --> 17:59.844
my release in exchange?

17:59.879 --> 18:01.345
You think this is a game.

18:01.380 --> 18:02.780
If I am released,

18:02.815 --> 18:05.816
I will surely accept it.

18:05.851 --> 18:08.352
But I don't know
who is behind this.

18:08.387 --> 18:10.454
(scoffs)

18:10.489 --> 18:12.490
It must feel

18:12.525 --> 18:15.526
something like when
you took my sister from me.

18:15.561 --> 18:17.428
Look at me.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.230
I am looking.

18:19.265 --> 18:22.600
This face is the last thing
you're gonna see before you die.

18:25.171 --> 18:26.470
You really think you know

18:26.505 --> 18:28.239
what is going to happen
in the future?

18:28.274 --> 18:31.509
No. I'm gonna make it happen.

18:31.544 --> 18:33.611
Oh.
And when the moment comes,

18:33.646 --> 18:35.646
after I'm through with you,

18:35.681 --> 18:37.515
you're gonna be begging to die.

18:37.550 --> 18:39.250
(laughs)

18:39.285 --> 18:42.153
Lots of talking.

18:43.189 --> 18:46.257
Ticktock, Sam.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.426
(imitates suffocating)

18:50.563 --> 18:52.630
(gasps)

19:01.607 --> 19:03.541
(presses button rapidly)

19:06.378 --> 19:07.545
Sam,

19:07.580 --> 19:09.346
I know you've done
the math already.

19:09.381 --> 19:10.748
How much time are we talking?

19:10.783 --> 19:12.516
Based on the size of the room,

19:12.551 --> 19:14.585
and the amount
of oxygen consumed

19:14.620 --> 19:17.521
by an average-sized person...

19:17.556 --> 19:20.591
she's got about eight hours
until she's poisoned

19:20.626 --> 19:22.460
by her own carbon dioxide.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.729
We've used up
about two, so far.

19:25.764 --> 19:30.201
GUARD: All D-block personnel,
prepare for yard transfer.

19:30.236 --> 19:32.203
Sam Hanna, you wanted to speak
to Michael Zhrov again?

19:32.238 --> 19:33.471
Yes.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.340
Well, I'm sorry, he was moved
from the prison 45 minutes ago.

19:36.375 --> 19:37.841
By who?
He was transferred

19:37.876 --> 19:39.577
into the custody of the CIA
for questioning.

19:39.612 --> 19:41.946
I'm sorry.
(sighs)

19:41.981 --> 19:44.481
Ferris and his CIA team
gave Tahir intelligence

19:44.516 --> 19:45.950
when he went
after my son.

19:45.985 --> 19:48.485
Only person we haven't found
in Ferris' group is Sabatino.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.554
(phone rings)

19:50.589 --> 19:51.589
Hello?

19:51.624 --> 19:53.557
SABATINO:
You know who this is?

19:53.592 --> 19:55.559
Speak of the devil.

19:55.594 --> 19:57.328
I'm texting you an address
in San Pedro.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.929
Come alone, Sam.
(call ends)

19:58.964 --> 20:00.063
It could be a trap.

20:00.099 --> 20:02.466
Yeah. It really doesn't matter
now, though, does it?

20:13.879 --> 20:15.813
(engine turns off)

20:26.659 --> 20:28.359
(gate closing)

20:37.002 --> 20:38.535
(gates closes)

20:38.570 --> 20:40.004
SAM:
You decided to to slither out

20:40.039 --> 20:41.372
from under your rock, huh?

20:41.407 --> 20:42.640
SABATINO:
I told you to come alone.

20:42.675 --> 20:43.807
SAM:
Oh, that's cute.

20:43.842 --> 20:45.576
You got cameras
out there?
No.

20:45.611 --> 20:46.610
Three agents in overwatch.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.979
Let's hope Callen doesn't
do anything stupid.

20:49.014 --> 20:50.681
Give me your comm.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.386
(comm drops)

20:55.421 --> 20:56.787
(comm crunches)

21:01.593 --> 21:03.360
Say hello to your buddy.

21:03.395 --> 21:04.428
Ah.

21:04.463 --> 21:06.563
I'm taking a huge risk
pulling him out of prison.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.899
My heart is breaking for you.
I need to question him.

21:08.934 --> 21:12.369
Look, I know there's a clock,
but this has to be clear.

21:12.404 --> 21:14.438
I'm giving you this gift

21:14.473 --> 21:16.006
so that you and
the other Cub Scouts

21:16.041 --> 21:18.542
might finally understand
that I had nothing,

21:18.577 --> 21:21.445
nothing to do with
coming after your team.

21:21.480 --> 21:22.546
I'm trying to help you.

21:22.581 --> 21:23.714
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:23.749 --> 21:25.683
I understand. Done.

21:25.718 --> 21:26.950
Can I question him now?

21:26.985 --> 21:29.687
Questions are for
cops and NCIS agents.

21:29.722 --> 21:32.356
What you need are answers.
Quickly.

21:32.391 --> 21:33.757
Zhrov,

21:33.792 --> 21:36.627
you tried to escape,
jumped from the car, ran,

21:36.662 --> 21:39.730
and got shot
from behind, got it?

21:39.765 --> 21:43.667
I did four years in
Russian Nazarovo prison.

21:43.702 --> 21:46.403
Makes Pelican Bay feel like
a country club full of women.

21:46.438 --> 21:47.705
I'm not talking.

21:47.740 --> 21:48.972
(yells)

21:49.007 --> 21:52.910
(screaming)

21:52.945 --> 21:56.447
(gasping)

21:56.482 --> 21:59.583
(groaning)

21:59.618 --> 22:00.985
Feel like a country club now?

22:02.988 --> 22:06.557
This is a simple
piece of rope.

22:06.592 --> 22:10.127
But it is the difference
between life and death.

22:10.162 --> 22:14.098
You tell this man everything he
needs to know and you get it.

22:14.133 --> 22:17.668
Fool around and you're
surely gonna die, my friend.

22:17.703 --> 22:19.737
So, I would really, really

22:19.772 --> 22:21.806
try and stay conscious
if I were you.

22:22.641 --> 22:24.875
I don't need to
repeat the question.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.577
Tahir...

22:26.612 --> 22:30.147
Tahir offered me the job when I
told him I had history with you.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.281
Who paid you?

22:31.317 --> 22:35.586
The money was transferred
into my account in Russia.

22:35.621 --> 22:37.788
That's all I know.
(phone dials, line rings)

22:37.823 --> 22:39.456
ERIC:
Hey, Sam.

22:39.491 --> 22:41.558
Eric, listen.

22:41.593 --> 22:42.793
Speak!

22:42.828 --> 22:44.762
I need the bank's name
and the account number.

22:44.797 --> 22:45.763
Speak!

22:45.798 --> 22:50.101
Marcov Bank of
Moscow, 04182001.

22:51.937 --> 22:53.170
SAM:
Eric, you got that?

22:53.205 --> 22:55.606
ERIC:
Got it.

22:55.641 --> 22:56.974
SAM: There should be
a large deposit. Trace it.
(groans)

22:57.009 --> 22:58.108
Whoever put that money
in the account,

22:58.143 --> 22:59.977
that's who has Michelle.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.991
$175,000 was transferred

23:14.026 --> 23:15.692
into Zhrov's bank account
four days ago.

23:15.727 --> 23:16.960
ERIC: The money moved
through several banks

23:16.995 --> 23:18.762
in Saudi Arabia,

23:18.797 --> 23:21.665
but originated in a corporate
account in North Sudan.

23:21.700 --> 23:22.833
MICHELLE:
Tahir is North Sudanese,

23:22.868 --> 23:23.968
it makes sense.

23:25.137 --> 23:26.603
Okay.

23:26.638 --> 23:28.038
All right, find out
who controls that account.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.673
W-We need a name.

23:29.708 --> 23:30.707
There's go to be
a connection

23:30.742 --> 23:32.609
to Los Angeles to that account.

23:32.644 --> 23:34.445
Yes.
MICHELLE: Sam...

23:34.480 --> 23:36.647
I know you've calculated
this all out.

23:38.884 --> 23:41.152
You want to tell me
what number you came up with?

23:44.890 --> 23:47.591
You got 12 to 14 hours
of oxygen left.

23:48.727 --> 23:50.027
Maybe a little more.

23:50.062 --> 23:52.095
That's funny, I came up
with something much less.

23:52.130 --> 23:54.198
I started out with eight hours,

23:54.233 --> 23:56.867
and now I'm guessing
I'm down to four.

23:58.971 --> 24:01.939
You want to go over
your math with me?

24:03.575 --> 24:06.143
We're gonna find you
long before that matters.

24:07.679 --> 24:09.646
Stop talking so much.

24:09.681 --> 24:10.881
You're using up oxygen.

24:10.916 --> 24:12.850
Speaking is not my problem.

24:12.885 --> 24:15.052
You've got no leads, baby.

24:15.087 --> 24:17.087
I'm a needle in a haystack.

24:21.026 --> 24:22.660
I need to talk to Hetty.

24:25.063 --> 24:27.064
(door opens, closes)

24:28.967 --> 24:30.934
We're gonna find you, Michelle.

24:30.969 --> 24:33.971
Take care of him, G.

24:36.675 --> 24:38.576
I always do.

24:44.283 --> 24:46.884
HETTY:
I understand.

24:46.919 --> 24:49.686
Yes, please.

24:49.721 --> 24:52.189
SAM: Hetty, I know
the United States has a policy

24:52.224 --> 24:53.824
of not negotiating
with terrorists,

24:53.859 --> 24:55.826
but we're not gonna
find Michelle in time.

24:55.861 --> 24:58.862
We need to start talking
to whoever it is

24:58.897 --> 25:00.664
that can authorize
Tahir's release.

25:00.699 --> 25:01.598
Sam,

25:01.634 --> 25:05.035
I have been working
to get authorization

25:05.070 --> 25:06.637
for Tahir's release

25:06.672 --> 25:08.205
since this began.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.640
Okay.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.775
I am on an open
line with SECNAV,

25:11.810 --> 25:14.311
and the president's
chief of staff.

25:14.346 --> 25:16.747
What are they saying?

25:18.750 --> 25:22.052
Actually, I don't give a damn
what they're saying

25:22.087 --> 25:25.523
because I'm not taking no
for an answer.

25:27.059 --> 25:29.126
Let me keep working.

25:29.161 --> 25:30.761
The best thing you can do

25:30.796 --> 25:32.763
is go talk to Michelle.

25:32.798 --> 25:34.331
Keep her calm.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.100
Don't let her lose hope.

25:37.803 --> 25:41.171
Don't... you... lose hope.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.207
(phone rings)

25:45.844 --> 25:46.877
Yeah?

25:46.912 --> 25:48.745
John,

25:48.780 --> 25:51.181
so help me,
I'm going to

25:51.216 --> 25:52.683
shame you
publicly for this.

25:52.718 --> 25:55.886
Eric, send Michelle's signal
to the armory.

25:55.921 --> 25:58.889
Shut it down in Ops
and cut it off from the FBI.

26:09.768 --> 26:11.768
Michelle, I cut off
the feed to Ops.

26:11.803 --> 26:13.770
It's just me and you now.

26:13.805 --> 26:15.806
(clears throat)
It's getting harder to breathe.

26:15.841 --> 26:16.773
(breathing heavily)

26:16.808 --> 26:17.942
You'll be okay.

26:19.811 --> 26:23.146
There's still plenty
of oxygen in that room.

26:23.181 --> 26:26.883
I'm trying to remember,
there was something...

26:26.918 --> 26:29.653
when we were driving, I...

26:29.688 --> 26:31.021
I can't figure it out.

26:31.056 --> 26:32.256
It'll come.

26:34.092 --> 26:37.194
Just... stay calm.

26:37.229 --> 26:39.830
(breathing heavily)
I'm scared.

26:39.865 --> 26:42.799
Michelle,
listen to me,

26:42.834 --> 26:44.969
you remember the walk?

26:47.839 --> 26:51.742
(crying)

26:51.777 --> 26:54.911
Yeah.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.313
Always.

26:56.348 --> 26:59.816
We went out to eat, we...
(Michelle chuckles)

26:59.851 --> 27:02.219
we... we talked all night.

27:02.254 --> 27:04.888
We stayed till they
closed the place.

27:04.923 --> 27:06.657
(sniffles)

27:06.692 --> 27:09.092
We drank way too much.
(laughs)

27:09.127 --> 27:10.126
(chuckles)
Yeah.

27:11.797 --> 27:14.898
We decided it'd be better
to just... walk home.

27:14.933 --> 27:18.168
We figured it was...

27:18.203 --> 27:19.870
a couple of miles.
(chuckles)

27:19.905 --> 27:22.673
We ended up walking for hours.

27:23.742 --> 27:26.677
(sniffles)
We walked very slowly.

27:26.712 --> 27:28.679
(softly):
Yeah.

27:28.714 --> 27:30.313
We didn't want it to end.

27:30.348 --> 27:33.917
You got on one knee,

27:33.952 --> 27:35.953
and you told me
that you loved me.

27:37.756 --> 27:40.457
(chuckles)
I had a lot to drink that night.

27:40.492 --> 27:43.093
(Michelle laughs)

27:44.930 --> 27:46.263
(sniffles)

27:46.298 --> 27:47.898
(crying):
That was the night that I knew

27:47.933 --> 27:50.701
that I would be
with you forever.

27:50.736 --> 27:53.804
We still have plenty of time.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.374
Do not give up.

28:00.779 --> 28:03.980
I want more time with you.

28:04.015 --> 28:07.918
I want more time with you
and my children.

28:11.123 --> 28:14.791
(Michelle continues crying)

28:14.826 --> 28:16.360
(footfalls approaching)

28:20.465 --> 28:23.467
What is it?

28:23.502 --> 28:29.005
SECNAV has just authorized
Tahir's release.

28:29.040 --> 28:30.741
That's good news.

28:30.776 --> 28:35.011
Under certain stipulations.

28:35.046 --> 28:37.481
Like?

28:37.516 --> 28:41.285
That we don't let him
out of our surveillance.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.553
So to not set precedent,

28:43.588 --> 28:47.023
they want to be able to say that
he was not actually released.

28:47.058 --> 28:48.759
The money trail's
gone dry,

28:48.794 --> 28:51.928
the North Sudanese
government's not cooperating.

28:51.963 --> 28:53.964
That's the only
real lead we have.

28:53.999 --> 28:55.832
There were no other hits
on the black van?

28:55.867 --> 28:57.033
No.

28:57.068 --> 28:58.869
(sighs)

28:58.904 --> 29:02.906
Well, coordinate
with the FBI.

29:02.941 --> 29:05.442
I want you in charge
of the surveillance.

29:12.117 --> 29:15.018
You do realize that if Tahir
doesn't feel completely safe,

29:15.053 --> 29:17.121
he's never gonna
reveal Michelle's location.

29:18.824 --> 29:22.926
I... understand...

29:22.961 --> 29:24.428
the dilemma.

29:33.471 --> 29:36.273
(strained):
You tell the children...

29:36.308 --> 29:41.545
I love them with
every fiber of my being.

29:41.580 --> 29:44.114
You're gonna tell them yourself

29:44.149 --> 29:45.582
when you see them.

29:45.617 --> 29:47.451
HETTY:
Sam?

29:52.123 --> 29:55.392
SECNAV has received
authorization

29:55.427 --> 29:57.093
to release Tahir.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.428
Thank you.

29:58.463 --> 29:59.563
Callen will be
running point

29:59.598 --> 30:02.265
on Tahir's overwatch.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.267
We need to keep him
under surveillance?

30:04.302 --> 30:06.069
That's the best I could do.

30:06.104 --> 30:08.138
(softly):
All right.

30:09.441 --> 30:11.308
Hey.

30:11.343 --> 30:12.475
You hear that?

30:12.510 --> 30:15.212
They authorized
Tahir's release.

30:15.247 --> 30:16.913
Michelle?

30:16.948 --> 30:18.849
Open your eyes, now!

30:21.019 --> 30:22.986
Tahir's being released.

30:23.021 --> 30:25.155
We're almost there.
Keep fighting!

30:26.157 --> 30:28.158
(strained breathing)

30:28.193 --> 30:30.027
I am.

30:31.062 --> 30:32.062
I am.

30:56.288 --> 30:57.554
GUARD:
Shut it.

31:03.995 --> 31:05.062
(tires screech)

31:09.234 --> 31:13.169
(engine revs, tires screech)

31:13.204 --> 31:14.404
(helicopter whirring)

31:23.949 --> 31:25.549
CALLEN (over comms):
Keep a 1,500 foot ceiling.

31:27.185 --> 31:28.118
Nice, clean handoffs, guys.

31:28.153 --> 31:29.286
Keep talking to each other.

31:31.122 --> 31:33.089
Picking up now. I have visual.

31:33.124 --> 31:34.524
CALLEN:
Don't be afraid to lose visuals.

31:34.559 --> 31:35.992
I got him from up here.

31:36.027 --> 31:37.594
We need him to feel safe.

31:37.629 --> 31:39.696
He's heading south on Western.

31:39.731 --> 31:40.997
I got him. You can peel off.

31:41.032 --> 31:42.633
FEMALE AGENT:
Handing off. He's yours.

31:44.035 --> 31:46.503
(helicopter whirring)

31:46.538 --> 31:48.939
CALLEN: He's turning west
on Lemon Grove. Too close.

31:48.974 --> 31:51.574
Stay back. We scare him,
this isn't going to work.

31:51.609 --> 31:53.510
MALE AGENT 2:
Coming up behind you.

31:53.545 --> 31:54.177
I'll take him from here.

31:54.213 --> 31:56.513
MALE AGENT:
He's yours.

31:58.550 --> 32:01.518
CALLEN: He's headed
towards a parking structure.

32:02.187 --> 32:03.653
I see it.

32:03.688 --> 32:06.456
CALLEN: Whoa, whoa, whoa,
watch the red truck.

32:06.491 --> 32:07.424
(tires screech)

32:07.459 --> 32:09.693
That's intentional;
he's making his move.

32:09.728 --> 32:10.427
Can you go around?

32:10.462 --> 32:11.328
MALE AGENT 2:
No, I'm blocked.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.597
The Corolla's driving inside.

32:14.632 --> 32:15.699
I lost visual.

32:15.734 --> 32:16.967
Should I pursue on foot?

32:17.002 --> 32:18.568
CALLEN:
Yeah, but stay back.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.938
He needs to believe
he's not being followed.

32:24.709 --> 32:26.343
Who's close to the exit
on Van Ness?

32:26.378 --> 32:28.078
FEMALE AGENT 2:
I'm two blocks to the east.

32:28.113 --> 32:30.981
Heading to the exit.
If he leaves, I'll pick him up.

32:31.016 --> 32:32.048
The Corolla is exiting

32:32.083 --> 32:33.750
the structure
on the west side.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.051
FEMALE AGENT 2:
Almost there.

32:35.086 --> 32:36.219
I see him.

32:36.254 --> 32:38.388
Don't rush.

32:38.423 --> 32:39.689
There are two white Corollas.

32:39.724 --> 32:41.091
MALE AGENT:
Two?

32:41.126 --> 32:42.325
Trying to get there.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.327
CALLEN:
We have a third.

32:44.362 --> 32:46.096
We'll follow the last one.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.064
MALE AGENT 3: 30 seconds
until I get to the exit.

32:48.099 --> 32:50.000
Eric, Look.
There's a fourth.

32:50.035 --> 32:50.767
Which one should I pick up?

32:50.802 --> 32:52.235
CALLEN:
And a fifth.

32:53.338 --> 32:54.437
MALE AGENT:
Which one? I'm seeing two.

32:54.472 --> 32:55.271
Callen, talk to me.

32:55.306 --> 32:56.740
CALLEN:
He could be in any of them,

32:56.775 --> 32:58.441
or back in the structure.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.076
I'm inside the structure.
I don't see him.

33:00.111 --> 33:01.411
FEMALE AGENT 2:
What's the call?

33:01.446 --> 33:03.179
HETTY:
Let him go.

33:03.214 --> 33:04.214
Pull all the tails.

33:05.316 --> 33:05.983
Who am I speaking with?

33:06.986 --> 33:11.721
This is NCIS Operations Manager
Henrietta Lange.

33:11.756 --> 33:13.556
You heard her,
break off the surveillance.

33:13.591 --> 33:16.526
We're really letting him go?

33:16.561 --> 33:18.261
Stop following those cars,
drive away now.

33:18.296 --> 33:20.430
FEMALE AGENT: Who's
authorizing this? I need a name.

33:20.465 --> 33:22.365
This has been authorized
by SECNAV.

33:22.400 --> 33:23.733
This is Intelligence Analyst
Nell Jones speaking.

33:23.768 --> 33:26.102
FEMALE AGENT 2:
Copy that.

33:26.137 --> 33:26.803
Breaking off.

33:26.838 --> 33:28.038
Break it off.

33:28.073 --> 33:29.773
Let's go back.

33:33.344 --> 33:36.747
There was no authorization,
was there?

33:40.785 --> 33:44.087
You didn't have to
do that, Ms. Jones.

33:44.122 --> 33:48.158
Destroying one career
would have sufficed.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.129
I'm good with my decision.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.803
(door closes)

34:02.707 --> 34:04.240
We just passed hour eight,

34:04.275 --> 34:05.809
there's still no word
from Tahir's people.

34:08.379 --> 34:10.180
How is she?

34:11.216 --> 34:13.416
She's not good.

34:13.451 --> 34:16.253
Well, she's still
breathing, I...

34:18.223 --> 34:21.191
Kamran's only 12-years-old.

34:22.227 --> 34:26.163
I'm aware of the child's age.

34:35.306 --> 34:36.606
Sam.

34:37.742 --> 34:40.410
I figured it out.

34:40.445 --> 34:43.179
What is it?

34:43.214 --> 34:45.815
The van was moving.

34:45.850 --> 34:48.452
The engine was running...

34:50.788 --> 34:54.424
...but there were
no other sounds.

34:54.459 --> 34:57.727
No cars.

34:57.762 --> 34:59.129
Nothing.

34:59.164 --> 35:02.599
(strained breathing)

35:07.338 --> 35:09.139
(line ringing)

35:09.174 --> 35:10.473
G.

35:10.508 --> 35:11.508
Sam.

35:11.543 --> 35:12.575
Michelle says she didn't hear

35:12.610 --> 35:13.877
the sound of any other cars.

35:13.912 --> 35:17.213
What if the kidnappers
were rocking the van

35:17.248 --> 35:19.182
to make her feel
like she was moving,

35:19.217 --> 35:21.918
b-but it was really just
sitting in the garage?

35:21.953 --> 35:24.154
They wanted us to think
they were driving

35:24.189 --> 35:25.222
for 90 minutes.

35:25.257 --> 35:27.190
Well, that would explain
why the van didn't show up

35:27.225 --> 35:28.191
on any of the highway cams.

35:28.226 --> 35:30.727
That's why they let us
communicate with her.

35:30.762 --> 35:33.196
They needed Michelle to tell us
how long they were driving.

35:34.232 --> 35:37.800
G, that van didn't leave
my neighborhood.

35:37.835 --> 35:39.369
Pull back
every agent we have

35:39.404 --> 35:42.539
to within a one-mile radius
of Sam's house now.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.914
KENSI: Eric, what are we
doing? This is 440 Seaton,

35:50.949 --> 35:53.183
the same warehouse that had the
security cameras this morning.

35:53.218 --> 35:54.250
ERIC:
I know.

35:54.285 --> 35:55.351
But looking at the city records,

35:55.386 --> 35:58.288
it used to be a pharmaceutical
distribution center.

35:58.323 --> 36:01.257
Which means they would have
refrigerators to hold the meds.

36:01.292 --> 36:03.260
We'll take it.

36:08.933 --> 36:10.900
Hi. Remember us?
Yeah, how you doing?

36:10.935 --> 36:11.901
You got a refrigerator
in this building?

36:11.936 --> 36:13.403
Yeah.

36:13.438 --> 36:14.904
We need to see that.
Hey, wait, uh...

36:14.939 --> 36:16.906
KENSI:
Excuse us.

36:16.941 --> 36:17.941
(door closes)

36:18.810 --> 36:21.678
(keys jingling)

36:21.713 --> 36:24.247
This is it.

36:24.282 --> 36:25.482
KENSI:
Ready?

36:34.359 --> 36:35.658
Thanks.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.460
Didn't really have a choice.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.584
SAM:
Michelle.

37:01.619 --> 37:03.620
Michelle!

37:08.326 --> 37:10.327
Michelle!

37:11.896 --> 37:13.830
(phone rings)

37:13.865 --> 37:15.331
Hey.

37:15.366 --> 37:17.433
I don't know
if she's still breathing.

37:17.468 --> 37:20.570
I'll be there in a minute.

37:22.774 --> 37:23.906
(sighs)

37:23.941 --> 37:25.541
Did you see the phone
on the table?

37:25.576 --> 37:26.609
Yeah.

37:26.644 --> 37:27.777
He had another one
on his belt,

37:27.812 --> 37:28.911
and there was yet
a different one

37:28.946 --> 37:30.046
in the security room
earlier.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.649
So the guy has three phones.

37:32.684 --> 37:34.984
Yeah.
ERIC: Hey, I'm scrubbing
through the warehouse footage

37:35.019 --> 37:35.985
from this morning.

37:36.020 --> 37:39.322
After the van went by,
there's nothing there.

37:39.357 --> 37:40.456
Meaning what?

37:40.491 --> 37:42.458
Meaning,
I should be seeing you two

37:42.493 --> 37:43.893
when you both
went into the building.

37:43.928 --> 37:44.894
DEEKS:
So the footage

37:44.929 --> 37:47.664
was prerecorded to make us think
the van went by.

37:47.699 --> 37:49.632
So it's still somewhere
in the building.

37:49.667 --> 37:51.768
And so is Michelle.

37:51.803 --> 37:53.936
Beale, we're going in and
we're not waiting for backup.

37:53.971 --> 37:56.039
Send an ambulance.
ERIC: On it.

37:57.375 --> 37:59.976
Deeks, whatever it takes.

38:05.950 --> 38:08.885
ERIC: Callen, Kensi and Deeks
think they found Michelle.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.386
Address is on your phone.

38:10.421 --> 38:12.822
Sam, they may
have found her.

38:16.894 --> 38:18.061
(pick drops)
Ready?

38:18.096 --> 38:19.729
One, two, three.

38:19.764 --> 38:20.863
(automatic gunfire)

38:20.898 --> 38:22.432
Damn it.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.335
Banging.

38:25.370 --> 38:26.402
(pin drops)

38:26.437 --> 38:28.605
One, two, three.

38:30.375 --> 38:31.408
(grenade explodes)

38:36.447 --> 38:37.681
(man yells)

38:47.992 --> 38:48.692
DEEKS:
Drop it!

38:49.394 --> 38:50.093
(yells)

38:53.531 --> 38:54.864
(gun slides)

38:57.769 --> 38:58.835
What...

39:00.171 --> 39:01.604
Kens!

39:25.930 --> 39:27.564
(grunts)

39:43.514 --> 39:45.715
DEEKS:
Michelle.

39:45.750 --> 39:47.884
KENSI: We got her,
guys, we got her.

39:57.762 --> 39:59.162
(indistinct police radio
chatter)

39:59.197 --> 40:00.897
(helicopter whirring)

40:23.187 --> 40:25.188
¶ ¶

40:51.749 --> 40:53.817
Give him some privacy, please?

41:10.234 --> 41:12.235
(sniffles)

41:12.270 --> 41:13.903
(crying)

41:27.618 --> 41:29.185
(crying)

41:29.220 --> 41:30.820
Please...

41:42.867 --> 41:44.534
(sniffles)

41:59.650 --> 42:04.287
Please, please...
