26:17.227 --> 26:20.970

maintenance with the pancakes.

26:21.014 --> 26:23.843
Griffin, you had to
have chocolate chip.

26:23.886 --> 26:26.933
And Ben, it was, uh,
blueberries, right?

26:26.976 --> 26:29.065
- No, it was bananas for him.

26:29.109 --> 26:31.372
You were scared of blueberries
because of Willy Wonka.

26:31.415 --> 26:34.941
Remember that? Dude.

26:37.944 --> 26:40.337
- I got to get to school.
I can walk.

26:41.861 --> 26:43.906
- Class doesn't start
for an hour.

26:51.566 --> 26:55.309
I happen to know that
because I have a meeting there

26:55.352 --> 26:58.617
with your social worker
and the guidance counselor.

26:58.660 --> 26:59.835
- Why?

26:59.879 --> 27:02.490
- Just want to see
how I can help.

27:02.533 --> 27:04.971
- Just so you know,
the social worker,

27:05.014 --> 27:07.190
she thinks my aunt
is still here.

27:08.539 --> 27:11.499
Or she'd, like, put us
in a--a foster home.

27:11.542 --> 27:13.588
- And that guidance counselor
has it out for me.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.155
So don't believe anything
she says.

27:20.290 --> 27:23.250

she care about that?

27:23.293 --> 27:25.644

Aunt Cammy left,

screw things up.

27:30.605 --> 27:33.216
It won't make it worse.
I promise.

27:35.392 --> 27:38.657
Just make sure
you're home later

27:38.700 --> 27:42.573

before I head back. Okay?

27:44.619 --> 27:47.535

Herrmann shut it down so quick.

cosmic justice for a change.

really impressed me.

28:34.060 --> 28:36.366

28:36.410 --> 28:38.281

is worth more to the CFT

28:38.325 --> 28:40.762

than anything else.

28:40.806 --> 28:44.200
May not be pretty,
but it runs.

28:44.244 --> 28:47.160
So we're donating it
to your paramedicine program.

28:49.597 --> 28:51.120

28:51.164 --> 28:52.600

the department

28:52.643 --> 28:55.081

If you can prove it works,

28:55.124 --> 28:56.430
they'll make
the funding permanent.

28:56.473 --> 28:58.475

28:58.519 --> 29:01.087
Your vote of confidence
means so much.

29:01.130 --> 29:04.003

vote of confidence in you

29:04.046 --> 29:05.656

29:09.835 --> 29:13.229

was the one who talked to him.

29:18.104 --> 29:19.235

the boys' guardian

29:19.279 --> 29:20.802
when they were younger?
- Yeah.

29:20.846 --> 29:24.110
About nine years ago now.
They're great kids.

29:24.153 --> 29:25.502

29:25.546 --> 29:26.808
They haven't
been totally honest

29:26.852 --> 29:28.375

as you probably know.

29:29.506 --> 29:31.117
- In what way?

29:31.160 --> 29:33.162

29:33.206 --> 29:36.557

she left over a month ago.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.167

were supposed to report

29:38.211 --> 29:40.300

29:45.174 --> 29:47.176

have this meeting is,

29:53.356 --> 29:55.750

the boys' guardian before

29:55.794 --> 29:58.666

30:16.118 --> 30:18.164

right now.

30:18.207 --> 30:19.339
- How so?

30:19.382 --> 30:21.471

been bounced around

30:21.515 --> 30:23.169
for most of their lives,

30:23.212 --> 30:26.346
and they finally found a place
to call home.

some bumps along the road,
