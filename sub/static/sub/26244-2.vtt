Jorgen? Have you seen him?
Am I too late?

16:28.028 --> 16:30.406
I've waited for so long.

16:30.489 --> 16:33.826
He's been coming here for days.
Why didn't you notice?

16:34.451 --> 16:36.328
I told him not to wait any longer.

16:36.912 --> 16:39.873
The snow must have blocked my ears.

16:40.708 --> 16:41.709
I'm so sorry.

16:44.586 --> 16:45.838
Ah!

16:46.338 --> 16:48.841
[groans]

16:48.924 --> 16:53.679
[all screaming]

16:54.847 --> 16:56.765
-[Alfur] Oof!
-[Jorgen] Ah.

16:56.849 --> 16:57.808
Got you.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.021
Jorgen.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.400
[Jorgen] You're here.

17:06.900 --> 17:10.821
But how?
Where were you on the nights I waited?

17:10.904 --> 17:13.741
My love,
things got complicated after you left.

17:14.616 --> 17:16.243
The little people came.

17:16.326 --> 17:19.371
Everyone was fed up
and decided to leave or hide.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.331
But I couldn't bear to.

17:23.208 --> 17:26.545
<i>I came to the spot we arranged to meet</i>
<i>not long after you left.</i>

17:27.796 --> 17:29.339
<i>I sat down and waited...</i>

17:31.800 --> 17:32.760
<i>and waited.</i>

17:34.470 --> 17:36.722
<i>I must have fallen asleep at some point.</i>

17:36.805 --> 17:38.432
[birds chirping]

17:40.768 --> 17:41.977
I'm so sorry.

17:44.772 --> 17:49.735
[Jorgen] You waited for me
for 4,000 years.

17:50.611 --> 17:51.737
Yep.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.490
[Jorgen] Wow.

18:00.913 --> 18:01.789
Whoa.

18:02.456 --> 18:05.084
[elf king] Oh, um, young lady!
[chuckles]

18:05.167 --> 18:06.835
Ahem, young lady!

18:07.419 --> 18:12.216
Young miss, in light of, um,
recent events, I, the king,

18:12.299 --> 18:17.721
would like to declare the conflict
between yourself and my people over.

18:17.805 --> 18:21.725
You've shown yourself to be
honorable and a proponent of peace.

18:21.809 --> 18:25.187
I will speak
to the prime minister immediately

18:25.270 --> 18:27.815
and inform him of the news.

18:27.898 --> 18:31.902
-It's not official until you sign.
-Oh, I'm signing it this minute.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.531
[elves cheering]

18:35.614 --> 18:37.699
Oh, it's official!

18:37.783 --> 18:39.868
You're no longer an enemy of my people!

18:39.952 --> 18:43.038
[squeals] There's nothing for Mum
to worry about now.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.416
[gasps] What on Earth is going on here?

18:48.001 --> 18:50.379
I know this might seem weird,
but I'm holding a castle,

18:50.462 --> 18:53.882
and this is the king,
and, basically, we don't have to move!

18:55.592 --> 18:57.052
[gasps]

18:57.136 --> 18:59.096
The house! Everything!

18:59.179 --> 19:01.265
It's gone, it's all gone.

19:06.103 --> 19:08.397
They haven't even noticed
what they've done.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.085
We'll be all right, Mum.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.988
[Wood Man] For the fire
in your new place in Trolberg.

19:58.071 --> 19:59.948
Oh, thank you.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.702
-I found this in the rubble.
-My sketchbook.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.831
I certainly have no use for it.
It smells like troll spit.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.628
[Hilda sighs]
I wish I didn't have to leave here.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.131
I'm going to miss all of this.

20:17.591 --> 20:18.675
I'll even miss you.

20:19.176 --> 20:20.802
You know where to find me.

20:21.386 --> 20:23.555
-That's very comforting.
-For you.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.434
Hilda, I'm afraid we need to get going.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.270
[Alfur panting]

20:30.354 --> 20:31.897
Hilda! Wait!

20:31.980 --> 20:33.065
Alfur!

20:35.776 --> 20:39.738
[gasps] I've been up all night filling out
the required paperwork for travel,

20:39.821 --> 20:41.365
and it's official!

20:41.448 --> 20:42.282
Look!

20:42.366 --> 20:46.286
"Northern Elven Counties Passport
and Permission to Travel."

20:46.370 --> 20:49.331
I'm the first elf from these parts
to visit Trolberg

20:49.414 --> 20:52.125
and file reports on life in the big city!

20:52.668 --> 20:55.712
And, if it's
not too terribly inconvenient,

20:55.796 --> 20:57.464
I'd like to hitch a ride with you.

20:57.547 --> 20:59.132
If you don't mind, that is.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.759
Are you kidding?

21:00.842 --> 21:03.136
It'll be so nice
to have a friend from home.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.346
Hop aboard, Alfur.

21:08.725 --> 21:10.811
Hilda, who are you talking to?

21:10.894 --> 21:13.397
Um... I'll tell you on the drive.

21:13.939 --> 21:17.526

Are you already writing your first report?

21:57.566 --> 21:59.401
-We just got here.
-Indeed.

21:59.484 --> 22:02.696
I want to set down my first impressions
while they're still fresh.

22:03.280 --> 22:06.825
More humans
than I've ever seen in one place.

22:06.908 --> 22:09.453
Fascinating noises,
and it's all very strange,

22:09.536 --> 22:11.538
but also exciting.

22:12.706 --> 22:15.667
I think it just seems loud and crowded.

22:15.751 --> 22:19.379
You can barely see the sky,
the trees are too small for climbing,

22:19.463 --> 22:22.632
and they built a wall
to keep out anything interesting.

22:23.925 --> 22:25.177
[sighs]

22:34.353 --> 22:36.688
[thunder rumbling]

22:42.319 --> 22:44.863
