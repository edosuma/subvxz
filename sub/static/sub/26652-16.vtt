00:00.701 --> 00:02.702
Previously on
<i>"Legends of Tomorrow"...</i>

00:02.770 --> 00:04.871
Astra, this place,
it's twisted you.

00:04.939 --> 00:06.372
It's made me more like you.

00:06.441 --> 00:08.341
<i>When you took on
the wand's power,</i>

00:08.409 --> 00:10.843
you also took on its charge.

00:10.912 --> 00:12.979
Oh, Fairy Godmother.

00:13.047 --> 00:16.315
Go find John and help him
rescue Ray from hell.

00:16.384 --> 00:17.717
Gary, you dick!

00:17.785 --> 00:19.685
I have created a simple app.

00:19.754 --> 00:21.487
<i>You will be able to share
monster sightings.</i>

00:21.556 --> 00:22.788
"In exchange for this service,

00:22.857 --> 00:24.790
"the user agrees to forfeit
their eternal soul

00:24.859 --> 00:26.158
to the demon Neron."

00:26.227 --> 00:27.660
He may be planning
a monster attack.

00:27.729 --> 00:29.028
Get every single one
of those monsters

00:29.097 --> 00:30.363
<i>out of the Time Bureau.</i>

00:30.431 --> 00:31.797
It's a bloody jailbreak!

00:31.866 --> 00:34.767
No!

00:34.836 --> 00:36.102
What kind of egg is that?

00:36.170 --> 00:39.505
<i>- It's a dragon egg.</i>
- My name is Zari.

00:46.548 --> 00:48.014
Whoopsie.
Hey!

00:48.082 --> 00:50.483
You haven't happened to see
an ogre wandering around

00:50.552 --> 00:52.952
about yay high, likes to grunt,
drink beer?

00:53.021 --> 00:54.253
Ask Rory.

00:56.958 --> 00:59.125
Ogre wins again.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.594
Cheating bastard.
No one outdrinks Mick Rory.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.263
Hey, fellas.

01:04.331 --> 01:06.632
Sorry to break up all the fun,
but, uh, technically,

01:06.701 --> 01:08.568
I wasn't supposed to allow any
magical creatures

01:08.636 --> 01:09.869
out of the lab, so...

01:12.707 --> 01:14.807
On second thought, why don't
you two finish up here?

01:14.876 --> 01:17.376
And I'll go, uh,
track down the Minotaur.

01:17.445 --> 01:18.844
<i>♪ Whiskey woman... ♪</i>

01:18.913 --> 01:20.746
You're not a horrible mother.

01:20.815 --> 01:22.515
You just have a lot
on your mind.

01:22.584 --> 01:25.551
I left our dragon egg in
the care of nine-year-old me.

01:25.620 --> 01:27.653
Has anybody seen Gary?

01:27.722 --> 01:29.755
Wait, what did you just say?
I was distracted.

01:29.824 --> 01:31.857
I just found out the Eyes app
is stealing peoples' souls,

01:31.926 --> 01:34.226
and then baby me comes home,
and I-I...

01:34.295 --> 01:36.195
You two need to grab
that egg before it hatches.

01:36.264 --> 01:38.464
We can't risk Ne-ray getting
his hands on a baby dragon.

01:38.533 --> 01:39.899
It's already bad enough
that he has Charlie.

01:39.968 --> 01:41.100
- Okay.
- Fair.

01:44.172 --> 01:45.638
Get up.

01:45.707 --> 01:46.872
Time's a-wasting.

01:46.941 --> 01:49.809
There are souls just waiting
to be sold.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.611
You're off your rocker,
you old nag.

01:51.679 --> 01:54.380
This here shape-shifter
don't take requests.

01:54.449 --> 01:58.017
Shape-shifter?
Is that all you think you are?

01:58.086 --> 02:01.487
You may have your human friends
fooled, dearie,

02:01.556 --> 02:05.424
but you and I both know what
you're truly capable of.

02:05.493 --> 02:07.560
- You don't know me!
- Don't I?

02:07.629 --> 02:10.997
The shape your wearing,
though lovely, is a costume.

02:11.065 --> 02:14.667
It's not who you really are.

02:14.736 --> 02:17.336
You aren't meant to hide,
my pet.

02:17.405 --> 02:21.807
You are meant to show humans
their greatest fears.

02:21.876 --> 02:23.409
And lucky for you,

02:23.478 --> 02:27.847
helping monsters fulfill
their potential...

02:27.915 --> 02:29.682
is what I do.

Yes!

02:40.294 --> 02:42.828
Ah!

02:44.365 --> 02:46.265
Damn it, Gary.

02:46.334 --> 02:49.402
Oh, excuse me, hey.
Hi.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.203
Excuse me, sir.

02:51.272 --> 02:54.306
Hi, pardon me, I just,
um... I don't belong here.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.776
No?
And I'm a...

02:56.844 --> 03:00.079
I'm a Fairy Godmother sent
to find John Constantine!

03:01.749 --> 03:03.382
Ooh.
Ooh.

03:05.753 --> 03:08.387
Really?

03:08.456 --> 03:09.889
What, are the King and Queen
of hell

03:09.957 --> 03:11.290
making their grand debut?

03:11.359 --> 03:13.426
Not our debut, dearie.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.495
No, no, no.
Stop.

03:16.564 --> 03:17.730
What are you doing?

03:17.799 --> 03:19.565
As much as I'd like to
pontificate

03:19.634 --> 03:21.100
about my grander plan...

03:22.403 --> 03:23.769
I've taught him better
than that.

03:28.710 --> 03:29.775
Huh.

03:29.844 --> 03:31.177
Who the hell are you?

03:31.245 --> 03:34.146
Really?
The dress doesn't sell it?

03:34.215 --> 03:36.582
You didn't tell me you had
a Fairy Godmother, John.

03:36.651 --> 03:38.350
Not his, Gary's.

03:38.419 --> 03:40.319
And I thought I was the one
being tortured.

03:40.388 --> 03:43.122
Look, Princess, we got rules
here in hell.

03:43.191 --> 03:44.657
All right?
You can't just...

03:46.360 --> 03:47.860
Let's go.

03:47.929 --> 03:49.161
What are you doing?

03:49.230 --> 03:50.996
Going to find Ray,
same way I found you.

03:51.065 --> 03:53.299
The only difference
is Ray doesn't have a body.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.468
So let's go find his soul.

03:55.536 --> 03:59.405
His soul token,
that's the currency in hell.

03:59.474 --> 04:01.140
While a soul is being tortured,

04:01.209 --> 04:03.943
then its token is traded
around town like money.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.711
As long as you have it,
then you'll always

04:05.780 --> 04:06.812
have access to the soul.

04:06.881 --> 04:09.882
But since Neron is
still topside,

04:09.951 --> 04:14.386
then his token's likely
locked in his vault.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.454
Then let's go find it.

04:18.493 --> 04:20.493
- Why isn't this working?
- I'm sorry, love.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.128
You can't just go
poofing yourself

04:22.196 --> 04:23.829
into the vaults of hell.

04:23.898 --> 04:26.265
We'll have to find someone
to help us break in.

04:30.438 --> 04:32.505
And I think I know
just the person.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.408
I don't see her.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.711
How do you know what
nine-year-old me looks like?

04:38.780 --> 04:41.847
I'm just looking for
the coolest kid in school.

04:41.916 --> 04:43.582
Yeah, there's a lot
I haven't told you

04:43.651 --> 04:44.984
about my childhood.

04:45.052 --> 04:48.454
There, that's the spot where
kids used to gang up on me

04:48.523 --> 04:51.624
and say, "Zari, Zari,
why your clothes so sorry?"

04:51.692 --> 04:53.259
Aww.

04:53.327 --> 04:56.428
I would have said, "Zari, Zari,
you smell like calamari."

04:56.497 --> 04:58.831
Bullying is bad.

04:58.900 --> 05:00.199
All right, let's break this up

05:00.268 --> 05:01.700
and find out where I stashed
the egg.

05:01.769 --> 05:04.703
- He's so cool.
- Oh, look how cute he is.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.839
- I want a dragon.
- He's so adorable.

05:06.908 --> 05:07.840
Come here.

05:07.909 --> 05:09.809
I want to take him home with me.

05:09.877 --> 05:12.244
Oh, my God, he hatched.

05:14.048 --> 05:16.048
And I brought him to school.

05:16.117 --> 05:17.449
Okay, so we got
to get him before...

05:17.518 --> 05:18.751
Whoa, wait.
Look.

05:18.820 --> 05:20.519
Mithra, dance.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.822
So cool.

05:25.259 --> 05:28.060
- Awesome, Zari.
- Thank you.

05:28.129 --> 05:29.094
Mm.

05:29.163 --> 05:31.197
Come on.

05:31.265 --> 05:33.399
What's going on, children?

05:33.467 --> 05:36.468
It's okay.
He's my pet, Mithra.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.537
I named him after the...
Run, children.

05:38.606 --> 05:39.939
It's a monster!

05:47.114 --> 05:48.147
Wait, Zari.
Zari, wait!

05:48.216 --> 05:49.715
Wait.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.684
Don't hurt him.

05:57.325 --> 05:58.858
Oh, my God, I lost him again.

06:02.096 --> 06:04.296
<i>Captain, I've located Neron.</i>

06:04.365 --> 06:05.865
<i>Now live to Capitol Hill,</i>

06:05.933 --> 06:07.867
<i>where the Palmer X CEO
is testifying</i>

06:07.935 --> 06:09.235
<i>before the Senate subcommittee.</i>

06:09.303 --> 06:10.769
<i>Look, I know Senator Wellington</i>

06:10.838 --> 06:13.472
doesn't believe that it's
up to the private sector

06:13.541 --> 06:17.309
to intervene in such
a unprecedented crisis.

06:17.378 --> 06:19.178
But I should mention,
not a single one

06:19.247 --> 06:22.581
of my subscribers has been
harmed in a monster attack.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.550
Senator, do you care to respond?

06:26.787 --> 06:29.421
This bloke is just trying
to scare folks

06:29.490 --> 06:33.092
into downloading his evil,
soul-sucking app.

06:33.160 --> 06:37.129
There ain't no such thing
as monst...

06:39.734 --> 06:42.067
This isn't me!

06:42.136 --> 06:43.736
I'm not doing this!

06:48.175 --> 06:51.043
Like I said, they could be
hiding anywhere...

06:51.112 --> 06:53.245
and only you can stop them.

07:08.204 --> 07:09.437
Wait, it might be Charlie.

07:09.506 --> 07:11.572
Well, who am
I supposed to shoot?

07:16.579 --> 07:18.646
There.

07:31.544 --> 07:34.429
Damn pigs!
I'm trying to help you out!

07:46.142 --> 07:47.542
Stay there.

07:49.979 --> 07:50.978
We got to go!

07:52.048 --> 07:53.147
Come on.

07:56.586 --> 07:59.420
Let her go.
She served her purpose.

08:13.937 --> 08:16.971
Astra Logue.
Name's Neron.

08:17.040 --> 08:18.840
I hear good things about you.

08:18.908 --> 08:21.142
Now that I'm taking over
for your former employers, I...

08:21.211 --> 08:22.944
Give it a rest, John.

08:23.012 --> 08:24.278
You think I can't see

08:24.347 --> 08:26.681
through your cheap little
parlor trick?

08:28.918 --> 08:31.285
How'd you get out of
the torture pits anyway?

08:35.825 --> 08:36.857
Nice sparkles.

08:36.926 --> 08:38.860
Nice shoulder pads.

08:38.928 --> 08:40.394
What do you want, John?

08:40.462 --> 08:41.895
And please tell me
you're not here to make

08:41.965 --> 08:44.565
some sad, sappy plea for me
to remember who I really am.

08:44.634 --> 08:48.903
I know exactly who you are.
You're someone I can work with.

08:48.972 --> 08:51.272
Now, the Triumvirate,
they were too short-sighted

08:51.341 --> 08:54.876
to take my deal, and now they
are roasting rats for supper.

08:54.944 --> 08:56.344
But you're smarter
than that, Astra.

08:56.412 --> 08:59.447
All I need is access to
one measly soul,

08:59.516 --> 09:02.250
and in exchange,
I'll go kill Neron,

09:02.318 --> 09:04.652
and your boys will be back
on top.

09:04.721 --> 09:09.190
This soul you're after...
must be pretty special.

09:09.259 --> 09:10.825
He is.

09:12.862 --> 09:16.564
I was special to you,
too, John... once.

09:16.633 --> 09:19.634
And yet, you left me down here
to rot all those years.

09:19.702 --> 09:22.136
- Astra, you can't...
- I'm over it.

09:22.205 --> 09:23.905
I made the best of
a bad situation,

09:23.973 --> 09:25.573
and guess what.

09:25.642 --> 09:26.774
I flourished.

09:26.843 --> 09:29.110
Down here, I had prospects

09:29.179 --> 09:32.280
until Neron wiped his ass
with them.

09:32.348 --> 09:35.583
So do we have a deal?

09:39.155 --> 09:42.356
Let's go rob the King.

09:42.425 --> 09:44.125
<i>Today's attack
at the U.S. Capitol</i>

09:44.194 --> 09:45.993
<i>has sparked worldwide panic
and paranoia</i>

09:46.062 --> 09:47.562
<i>over the threat
of magical creatures.</i>

09:47.630 --> 09:49.263
Enough, Gideon.

09:49.332 --> 09:50.665
Where is Neron in all of this?

09:50.733 --> 09:52.767
Why isn't he responding to
his magical-creature alerts?

09:52.836 --> 09:55.269
What alerts? All the
creatures are here on the ship.

09:55.338 --> 09:56.737
You know what?
It doesn't even matter.

09:56.806 --> 09:58.739
Neron's shown the world that
anyone can be a monster.

09:58.808 --> 09:59.807
People are turning on
each other.

09:59.876 --> 10:00.942
Everyone's terrified.

10:01.010 --> 10:02.443
I thought Neron wanted
to collect souls.

10:02.512 --> 10:04.245
How does hacking the app
only to let it fail

10:04.314 --> 10:05.813
get him what he wants?

10:05.882 --> 10:08.616
It's not about souls anymore.
It's something worse.

10:08.685 --> 10:10.218
Well, they didn't share
their endgame,

10:10.286 --> 10:11.652
but from what I could
figure out,

10:11.721 --> 10:13.187
they don't give a "fa"
about ruling hell.

10:13.256 --> 10:14.522
It's actually fear that
they're after.

10:14.591 --> 10:15.656
Why?

10:15.725 --> 10:18.359
Fear is power.
It's energy.

10:18.428 --> 10:19.961
And thanks to me,
they have a wallop of it

10:20.029 --> 10:21.195
to muck about with.

10:21.264 --> 10:22.730
<i>That might explain the strange</i>

10:22.799 --> 10:25.399
<i>meteorological event
forming over Washington, D.C.</i>

10:25.468 --> 10:27.201
Right above the Time Bureau.

10:27.270 --> 10:29.437
Gideon, do you have a visual?

10:32.475 --> 10:34.976
You're welcome, world.

10:37.780 --> 10:40.948
The air is thick with
human fear.

10:41.017 --> 10:44.285
The hour of our coronation
draws near, my pet.

10:44.354 --> 10:47.788
It's time to send your message
to your legions below.

10:47.857 --> 10:49.657
The bank's right around
the corner.

10:52.795 --> 10:56.197
What's happening?

10:56.266 --> 10:58.132
<i>Denizens of hell,</i>

10:58.201 --> 11:01.369
<i>for far too long, we have been
forced to live like insects</i>

11:01.437 --> 11:03.371
<i>underneath the Earth.</i>

11:03.439 --> 11:05.773
<i>Soon, a door will open.</i>

11:05.842 --> 11:09.243
<i>Look to the sky
and await my signal.</i>

11:09.312 --> 11:12.980
<i>With me as your king,
we will make Earth hell again.</i>

11:14.784 --> 11:17.351
So that's been his play
all along.

11:17.420 --> 11:19.453
We best keep moving, loves,

11:19.522 --> 11:21.956
before all hell literally
breaks loose.

11:31.295 --> 11:34.430
Stay calm, they smell fear.

11:34.498 --> 11:37.366
What if fear is
my natural scent?

11:42.540 --> 11:44.540
Good afternoon, everyone.

11:44.608 --> 11:47.009
We have your favorites.

11:47.077 --> 11:48.977
I know it's
a bit crowded in here,

11:49.046 --> 11:50.846
but we're making the best of it.

11:50.915 --> 11:53.348
Anybody want a sammy whammy?

11:55.453 --> 11:57.820
Put that in your whammy,
you dick.

11:57.888 --> 12:00.456
Okay, uh...

12:00.524 --> 12:01.523
Bon appétit.

12:06.530 --> 12:08.931
They are savages.

12:08.999 --> 12:10.732
Oh, calm down, Gary.

12:10.801 --> 12:13.302
The longer we keep the
magical creatures locked up,

12:13.370 --> 12:16.004
the more they're gonna act like
actual monsters.

12:16.073 --> 12:19.274
They are monsters, you twit,
and so are you.

12:19.343 --> 12:20.576
We all are.

12:20.644 --> 12:23.445
How are we supposed to defeat
fear itself?

12:23.514 --> 12:25.614
I mean, people afraid of Metas,

12:25.683 --> 12:28.584
magical creatures afraid
of people, and...

12:28.652 --> 12:30.853
Monsters hated by everyone.

12:30.921 --> 12:34.923
Not everyone.
Gideon, play the...

12:34.992 --> 12:36.291
<i>The "dancing dragon sneeze"
video.</i>

12:36.360 --> 12:37.259
Yep, that.

12:37.328 --> 12:38.961
<i>Mithra, dance.</i>

12:39.029 --> 12:40.295
- What is this?
- Wicksty.

12:45.569 --> 12:47.202
Aww.

12:47.271 --> 12:49.705
Yeah, this innocent moment
where kids aren't afraid,

12:49.773 --> 12:51.707
it's resonating with people.

12:51.775 --> 12:54.543
They don't see a monster,
they see something amazing.

12:54.612 --> 12:55.711
So do I.

12:55.779 --> 12:57.145
Me on that playground
surrounded by people

12:57.214 --> 13:00.215
who want to be my friend...

13:00.284 --> 13:01.783
Even if it was just for a day,

13:01.852 --> 13:05.354
that little baby dragon
changed my world.

13:05.422 --> 13:07.422
You sound like
my dad's pitch for...

13:09.593 --> 13:11.226
HeyWorld!

13:11.295 --> 13:12.761
Oh, my God, guys, that's it.

13:12.830 --> 13:14.196
What?
What's... what?

13:14.265 --> 13:16.064
My dad had a dream to build
a theme park

13:16.133 --> 13:18.634
that people would come to see
because of magic.

13:18.702 --> 13:20.168
That's what the world needs
right now,

13:20.237 --> 13:22.271
a place for people to come
and see the wonder

13:22.339 --> 13:23.906
of these creatures in person.

13:23.974 --> 13:25.741
What, so they can just
shoot us all in one place?

13:25.809 --> 13:26.942
That's bloody brilliant, that.

13:27.011 --> 13:29.811
No, so they can see creatures

13:29.880 --> 13:32.714
the way that you helped us
see creatures, Charlie.

13:32.783 --> 13:36.418
Not as monsters,
but as misfits just trying to

13:36.487 --> 13:37.953
find their place.

13:38.022 --> 13:40.055
Look, if we can learn
that lesson,

13:40.124 --> 13:41.924
then so can the rest of
the world.

13:41.992 --> 13:45.694
We just need to bring people
and creatures together.

13:45.763 --> 13:49.064
Think of it like
a magical version of Woodstock.

13:49.133 --> 13:50.666
"If we build it"...

13:50.734 --> 13:52.301
"They will come."

13:52.369 --> 13:54.102
How long until we can get it
up and running?

13:54.171 --> 13:56.939
Uh, if Mikey T and the boys
work weekends...

13:57.007 --> 13:58.574
Quick math in my head...

13:58.642 --> 14:01.243
Two, maybe three years.

14:01.312 --> 14:02.678
Oh.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.153
He's not a coin.

14:11.221 --> 14:14.389
- Observant.
- No flesh bags, just souls.

14:14.458 --> 14:17.492
That's why they call it
the Soul Exchange.

14:17.561 --> 14:20.028
Oh, right, then.
I'll be on me way, then.

14:20.097 --> 14:23.732
This is John Constantine.

14:23.801 --> 14:25.934
Oh, and me without
my autograph book.

14:26.003 --> 14:26.969
No worries, love.

14:27.037 --> 14:28.103
Next time, yeah?

14:28.172 --> 14:30.138
Look, if you would like
to convert

14:30.207 --> 14:31.506
his soul into cash, you need...

14:31.575 --> 14:33.342
Maybe you don't get it.

14:33.410 --> 14:36.111
Neron owns the marker
on his soul,

14:36.180 --> 14:39.481
and Neron wants to torture him
as soon as he gets here.

14:39.550 --> 14:42.584
But, hey, if you want to tell
the new boss why

14:42.653 --> 14:45.954
his prized victim isn't waiting
in his vault...

14:49.126 --> 14:50.292
This way.

14:52.096 --> 14:54.196
Not so rough.

14:54.264 --> 14:56.798
FYI, there's no bathroom
in here,

14:56.867 --> 14:58.033
and I'm not feeding him.

14:58.102 --> 15:00.435
I'm a bank teller, not a zoo...

15:03.340 --> 15:06.708
Pretty cool for a grown woman
wearing taffeta and a tiara.

15:06.777 --> 15:08.677
How does this work?

15:08.746 --> 15:11.847
We find a coin?
There are thousands.

15:11.915 --> 15:14.082
Some of history's worst.

15:14.151 --> 15:16.451
Yeah, I'd wager he's keeping
it somewhere special.

15:16.520 --> 15:17.953
Hey, what are you doing?

15:18.022 --> 15:19.588
What?

15:19.657 --> 15:21.056
Revolution's in the air,

15:21.125 --> 15:23.091
I've got to look out for
number one.

15:23.160 --> 15:26.294
You were a golden opportunity
to bankroll my future.

15:26.363 --> 15:28.196
I took it.

15:33.871 --> 15:35.871
What about Bridget's diary?

15:35.939 --> 15:37.339
If we put it in Nate's hands,

15:37.408 --> 15:39.307
he could just dream us up
a theme park.

15:39.376 --> 15:42.444
Z, you are a genius.
The...

15:42.513 --> 15:45.514
Ugh.
It's in the Time Bureau.

15:45.582 --> 15:47.349
It's okay, so we just break in,

15:47.418 --> 15:48.550
but it's not gonna be easy.

15:48.619 --> 15:50.218
Even if it isn't demon central,

15:50.287 --> 15:51.353
the vault that it's being
held in

15:51.422 --> 15:52.621
is practically impenetrable.

15:52.690 --> 15:54.423
Oh, it's penetrable.

15:54.491 --> 15:56.792
Oh, my God.

15:56.860 --> 15:58.627
I love you, Rory.
Mmhmm.

15:58.696 --> 16:00.228
Give it back when you're done.

16:00.297 --> 16:02.597
Buck and Garima's sexual
odyssey is far from over.

16:02.666 --> 16:04.099
All right, team.

16:04.168 --> 16:06.268
Nate, you have a theme park
to dream up.

16:06.336 --> 16:09.104
Gary, help Mona "Pretty Woman"
our creatures into something

16:09.173 --> 16:10.372
a little more kid friendly.

16:10.441 --> 16:12.307
And the rest of us,

16:12.376 --> 16:14.276
it's time to come up
with a marketing plan

16:14.344 --> 16:17.212
for the happiest place
on the planet.

16:20.918 --> 16:22.384
<i>Miss Tomaz,
your simulation program</i>

16:22.453 --> 16:23.652
<i>has detected a change</i>

16:23.721 --> 16:25.220
<i>in your presently
predicted future.</i>

16:25.289 --> 16:26.855
Good change or bad change?

16:26.924 --> 16:29.691
<i>In one potential 2042,
building HeyWorld</i>

16:29.760 --> 16:32.394
<i>leads to an era of
understanding and tolerance.</i>

16:32.463 --> 16:35.697
<i>The Anti-Meta-Human Act
of 2029 never passes,</i>

16:35.766 --> 16:37.132
<i>your parents live out
their lives</i>

16:37.201 --> 16:38.767
<i>peacefully in Seattle.</i>

16:38.836 --> 16:41.603
<i>The future as you know it
would be completely changed.</i>

16:44.608 --> 16:47.809
My parents.
They're, uh...

16:49.113 --> 16:53.115
That means a piece of this
crazy plan actually works.

16:53.183 --> 16:55.050
This is great news, right?

16:57.521 --> 17:00.122
God, I've been running that
stupid program for so long,

17:00.190 --> 17:03.125
I'd given up hope of it
actually working.

17:03.193 --> 17:07.362
If this works,
my brother survives...

17:07.431 --> 17:09.564
I never steal his totem back
from A.R.G.U.S.,

17:09.633 --> 17:11.133
I never join the Legends.

17:13.203 --> 17:15.403
Last two years wouldn't
have happened.

17:17.674 --> 17:21.476
Who knows where I'll be
or who I'll be?

17:21.545 --> 17:23.310
You'll be you.

17:25.382 --> 17:26.681
Because while we're at HeyWorld,

17:26.750 --> 17:29.351
you'll be here on the ship
in the temporal zone,

17:29.419 --> 17:30.852
and you'll be safe.

17:30.921 --> 17:33.088
Sara, I can't...
I can't sit this one out.

17:33.157 --> 17:35.390
Look, I'm not gonna lose
another Legend.

17:35.459 --> 17:38.126
And who said we're not
putting you to work?

17:38.195 --> 17:39.694
Look, we need to make sure
what happens at HeyWorld

17:39.763 --> 17:41.129
is seen globally.

17:41.198 --> 17:43.598
I can use the Eyes app
as a backdoor

17:43.667 --> 17:45.433
into the phones that
downloaded it.

17:45.502 --> 17:46.835
Thank you.

17:58.982 --> 18:01.349
I found it, I found it...
Ray's coin.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.886
So long, then, John boy,
for now.

18:04.955 --> 18:06.721
Whoa, hold on a minute.

18:06.790 --> 18:10.225
Our deal was for his soul,
not a bleeding coin.

18:10.294 --> 18:13.195
Fine, a promise is a promise.

18:34.251 --> 18:35.417
What are they doing to him
in there?

18:35.485 --> 18:36.885
Prepare yourself, love.

18:36.954 --> 18:39.287
What's behind this door,
it won't be pretty.

18:39.356 --> 18:40.989
Down there, they twist
a man's soul

18:41.058 --> 18:42.557
until he's no longer human.

18:42.626 --> 18:43.725
And what they've done to
the big man,

18:43.794 --> 18:45.060
he might not even be...

18:45.128 --> 18:46.394
Ray!

18:46.463 --> 18:48.029
Ray?

18:48.098 --> 18:49.865
Nora, John,
we're just about to start

18:49.933 --> 18:51.666
another game of Giant Jenga.

18:51.735 --> 18:52.701
You got to meet my old friend...

18:52.769 --> 18:54.035
Well, technically,
my new friend.

18:54.104 --> 18:55.370
We used to be mortal enemies.

18:55.439 --> 18:56.805
Oh, hi, guys.

18:56.874 --> 18:59.307
Well, you're just in time
for the next round.

19:03.648 --> 19:04.880
<i>When the world needs heroes,</i>

19:04.949 --> 19:06.793
<i>they answer the call.</i>

19:06.794 --> 19:08.250
We'll be at HeyWorld,

19:08.319 --> 19:11.754
the new adventure capital
of eastern Maryland...

19:11.823 --> 19:14.790
Where we will hit fun
in the bull's-eye.

19:14.859 --> 19:17.960
And we'll give your children
a flash...

19:18.079 --> 19:19.612
of excitement.

19:21.649 --> 19:23.816
And... cut.

19:23.884 --> 19:25.184
Whoo!

19:25.253 --> 19:26.619
- That was good, guys.
- That was a good take.

19:26.687 --> 19:27.886
It felt good.
That was a great take.

19:27.955 --> 19:30.089
Guys, I feel like that
would have worked

19:30.157 --> 19:31.991
a little bit better with
the real Trinity.

19:32.059 --> 19:35.961
Yeah, well, I asked,
and they said hard pass.

19:36.030 --> 19:37.196
We should have done a crossover.

19:37.265 --> 19:38.530
Yeah.

19:38.599 --> 19:39.832
Well, who needs the Trinity
anyway, right?

19:39.900 --> 19:41.734
I mean, the Legends are
super enough.

19:41.802 --> 19:44.169
But HeyWorld isn't
a superhero park.

19:44.238 --> 19:46.305
Promising them something
and giving them something else

19:46.374 --> 19:47.973
feels... I don't know...
Wrong, doesn't it?

19:48.042 --> 19:50.042
People aren't going to go
to a park

19:50.111 --> 19:52.011
filled with things
they're terrified of.

19:52.079 --> 19:56.081
People need franchise
superheroes to feel safe,

19:56.150 --> 19:58.417
so that's how we're gonna
get them in the door.

19:59.820 --> 20:03.889
Okay, everyone,
let's just go around the room

20:03.958 --> 20:06.859
one by one and say what talent
you can contribute

20:06.927 --> 20:09.561
to the HeyWorld revue.

20:09.630 --> 20:11.497
Oh, Minotaur,
let's start with you.

20:11.565 --> 20:13.565
I-I hear you like guitar.

20:13.634 --> 20:15.534
Don't tell her nothing,
bull face.

20:15.603 --> 20:18.537
- Let us out of here.
- We can't do that, Mr. Ogre.

20:18.606 --> 20:20.072
It's not safe out there.

20:20.141 --> 20:21.774
Well, we ain't helping you,

20:21.842 --> 20:25.277
what, with you moving us around
from one prison to another.

20:25.346 --> 20:27.846
So why should we trust you?

20:27.915 --> 20:29.448
Listen up, if you lot
don't want to go back

20:29.517 --> 20:31.817
to a real prison,
then this is your chance.

20:31.886 --> 20:35.120
This is your chance to change
the way that humans see you.

20:35.189 --> 20:38.190
Show them that just because
you look scary...

20:43.097 --> 20:45.964
Doesn't mean you are scary.

20:46.033 --> 20:48.033
That's right, Wolfie.

20:48.102 --> 20:50.836
Look, I know how infuriating
humans can be.

20:50.905 --> 20:52.204
They have a hard time

20:52.273 --> 20:53.772
seeing past their own noses,
don't they?

20:53.841 --> 20:56.742
But they can change...

20:56.811 --> 20:59.178
if you help them to look deeper.

20:59.246 --> 21:01.080
And if they see the amount
of good that

21:01.148 --> 21:02.348
you lot are capable of,

21:02.416 --> 21:04.883
then maybe...
Maybe they'll believe in you

21:04.952 --> 21:06.485
even when you doubt yourself.

21:08.255 --> 21:09.955
Now, I know that there's more
to all of you

21:10.024 --> 21:11.390
than meets the eye.

21:11.459 --> 21:13.892
Like you, Ogre.

21:13.961 --> 21:17.196
My name is Frederic.
But what's the point?

21:17.264 --> 21:20.532
Every time I try to show
a human who I really am,

21:20.601 --> 21:22.301
they run away or try to kill me.

21:22.370 --> 21:24.336
And that must really hurt
your feelings.

21:24.405 --> 21:26.105
Yeah, it does.

21:26.173 --> 21:27.973
All I ever wanted to do
was sing.

21:29.577 --> 21:31.043
Well, it looks like we found
ourselves a double act.

21:31.112 --> 21:32.745
Now, who else has
a hidden talent?

21:34.315 --> 21:36.682
Brilliant.

21:36.751 --> 21:38.150
Beautiful.

21:38.219 --> 21:39.852
I think we've got ourselves
a show.

21:41.889 --> 21:43.088
Wait, what are you doing here?

21:43.157 --> 21:44.156
Are you dead?

21:44.225 --> 21:45.324
Oh, please tell me
you're not dead.

21:45.393 --> 21:46.592
What are you doing in
that dress?

21:46.660 --> 21:47.726
Not that I don't like it, but...

21:47.795 --> 21:48.994
Mmm.

21:51.499 --> 21:52.664
Wow.

21:52.733 --> 21:54.032
Oh!
Idiot!

21:54.101 --> 21:56.068
What were you thinking
selling your soul to a demon?

21:56.137 --> 21:57.903
You... Ray...

21:59.173 --> 22:00.272
You doomed the whole planet!

22:00.341 --> 22:01.440
Look, I didn't have a choice.

22:01.509 --> 22:02.641
He was gonna kill Nate.

22:02.710 --> 22:03.642
It was the only way I could
make sure

22:03.711 --> 22:04.676
my best friend would be safe.

22:04.745 --> 22:07.279
So that was the deal you made...

22:07.348 --> 22:08.614
His life for your body.

22:08.682 --> 22:11.450
Oh, Raymondo, you sweet, dumb

22:11.519 --> 22:13.752
son of a softie.

22:13.821 --> 22:15.020
Yeah, right?

22:15.089 --> 22:16.889
What a guy!

22:16.957 --> 22:21.226
I was sent here to torture him,
but then we got to talking.

22:21.295 --> 22:23.462
Oh, it got really deep, man.

22:23.531 --> 22:25.130
It really did.

22:25.199 --> 22:28.233
What were we even fighting
about all those years ago?

22:28.302 --> 22:29.768
Your compulsion for
world domination

22:29.837 --> 22:31.470
and inability
to accept rejection.

22:31.539 --> 22:35.774
Ah, translation...
It was about a girl.

22:35.843 --> 22:37.042
A girl?
What girl?

22:37.111 --> 22:38.410
It doesn't matter.
We should go.

22:38.479 --> 22:41.513
Wait.
Something's happening.

22:41.582 --> 22:43.081
I think I fulfilled Gary's wish.

22:43.150 --> 22:44.349
Ray, take my hand.

22:44.418 --> 22:46.018
John.

22:46.086 --> 22:47.986
Oh, all right.
Ciao for now.

22:48.055 --> 22:50.856
Say hi to the Legends for me,
will you?

22:55.429 --> 22:58.330
Oh, I love those groovy guys.

22:59.733 --> 23:02.968
Jenga time!

23:03.037 --> 23:05.904
Oh, almost forgot...
Extra hot sauce

23:05.973 --> 23:09.241
for the chupacabra.

23:09.310 --> 23:11.176
What in the hell?

23:11.245 --> 23:12.744
More like "out of it," mate.

23:12.813 --> 23:15.414
It worked! It worked!
You got Constantine.

23:15.483 --> 23:16.882
All right, okay.
Be cool, just be cool.

23:16.951 --> 23:18.317
Simmer down, simmer down,
sunshine.

23:18.385 --> 23:19.451
Where's Ray?

23:19.520 --> 23:21.353
He was just here.
He...

23:23.724 --> 23:25.224
Yeah, that's the only way
he can travel

23:25.292 --> 23:26.692
as long as Neron's using
his body.

23:27.862 --> 23:29.962
Fairy Godmother, I wish for Ray

23:30.030 --> 23:31.296
to get his body back.

23:31.365 --> 23:33.432
Oh, um...

23:34.635 --> 23:36.368
All magic has its limitations...

23:36.437 --> 23:38.136
You know, stroke of midnight
and all that.

23:38.205 --> 23:39.538
But don't worry...

23:39.607 --> 23:42.641
I'm sure the Legends have
something up their sleeves.

23:42.710 --> 23:44.977
This isn't playtime, you twits.

23:45.045 --> 23:47.746
Neron is using fear
to open up the gates of hell.

23:47.815 --> 23:49.515
Well, that's why we have
to fight fear

23:49.583 --> 23:51.083
with something wonderful.

23:51.151 --> 23:52.851
We have to show the world that
these magical creatures

23:52.920 --> 23:54.553
are just that... they're magical.

23:54.622 --> 23:57.256
And everyone else
is on board with this?

23:57.324 --> 23:59.591
- Yeah.
- Yeah, pretty much.

23:59.660 --> 24:01.093
- Bloody hell.
- All right, great.

24:01.161 --> 24:04.129
Well, now that you're all
on board, we have work to do.

24:04.198 --> 24:06.865
There is another way.

24:06.934 --> 24:08.500
Whilst in hell, we learned that

24:08.569 --> 24:10.402
Neron's possession of Ray's body

24:10.471 --> 24:12.771
is contingent on Nate
not being killed.

24:14.008 --> 24:15.741
Is that why Ner-Ray

24:15.809 --> 24:17.776
didn't strangle me when he had
the chance?

24:17.845 --> 24:18.844
Yeah.

24:18.913 --> 24:21.547
A demon is only as good
as his word.

24:21.615 --> 24:22.714
If Neron breaks that deal,

24:22.783 --> 24:24.082
he'll be ejected from
Ray's body.

24:24.151 --> 24:25.617
I could kill him.

24:25.686 --> 24:30.122
And once I do, all the souls
he's nabbed will be released.

24:30.190 --> 24:33.258
And all Neron has to do
is, uh...

24:34.762 --> 24:36.328
Me?

24:38.999 --> 24:40.832
No, absolutely not.

24:40.901 --> 24:44.670
Look, there is no Plan B,
only Plan A, got it?

24:44.738 --> 24:47.372
Yeah, got it.

24:49.510 --> 24:51.209
Look, I meant what
I said earlier.

24:51.278 --> 24:53.145
I am not losing another Legend.

24:53.213 --> 24:54.947
So forget what you heard
back there,

24:55.015 --> 24:58.750
because we are all-in
on HeyWorld.

24:58.819 --> 25:01.286
Now, I believe in you,
and if I'm not mistaken,

25:01.355 --> 25:03.956
someone has a theme park
to build.

25:04.024 --> 25:05.157
Yeah.

25:09.196 --> 25:12.164
I can't believe it all
comes down to this.

25:12.232 --> 25:14.166
After years of anxiety of
whether or not

25:14.234 --> 25:17.202
I could live up to
my dad's expectations,

25:17.271 --> 25:20.305
I'm about to bring
his crazy dream to life...

25:20.374 --> 25:23.041
knowing what it could cost me.

25:23.110 --> 25:25.077
Nate, I'm not going anywhere.

25:32.920 --> 25:35.187
You got this.

25:35.255 --> 25:37.756
Okay.

25:39.493 --> 25:41.259
Let's do this.

26:12.871 --> 26:14.604
I'm standing in front of
HeyWorld,

26:14.673 --> 26:16.973
a new superhero-inspired
theme park

26:17.042 --> 26:20.177
that seems to have sprung up
overnight like magic.

26:23.148 --> 26:25.082
Welcome to HeyWorld,

26:25.150 --> 26:28.018
the happiest place on the globe.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.986
Hey, kid, welcome to HeyWorld.

26:30.055 --> 26:31.988
Try the churros and not just
because the real money

26:32.057 --> 26:34.391
is in the concessions,
they're also delicious.

26:39.531 --> 26:40.630
Z, um...

26:40.699 --> 26:43.200
<i>you and your mom are here.</i>

26:43.268 --> 26:45.702
I see them... I mean us.

26:45.771 --> 26:48.038
All right, stream's up.
You look great, by the way.

26:48.107 --> 26:50.307
Oh, thank you for noticing.
I showered.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.109
How's
the clickety-clackety-hackety

26:52.177 --> 26:53.610
coming along?

26:53.679 --> 26:56.012
Once Ava hits "record,"
this will stream out to about,

26:56.081 --> 26:57.781
you know,
3 billion people or so.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.249
No pressure.

27:00.586 --> 27:02.552
Come one, come all

27:02.621 --> 27:06.556
to our thrilling
stage spectacular...

27:06.625 --> 27:12.129
"Superheroes versus Monsters."

27:12.197 --> 27:14.064
Okay, you got
the choreography down?

27:14.133 --> 27:15.999
Everyone, follow her lead.

27:16.068 --> 27:17.400
Um... Ooh!

27:17.469 --> 27:20.270
Baba Yaga, remember, those kids
are audience members,

27:20.339 --> 27:21.571
not appetizers.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.174
Mike, watch your language
out there, right?

27:24.243 --> 27:25.642
We don't want those wankers

27:25.711 --> 27:28.745
from Standards and Practices
up our you-know-whats.

27:28.814 --> 27:31.214
Everyone, they're gonna love
you guys.

27:31.283 --> 27:34.317
All right, gang, it's showtime.

27:39.691 --> 27:43.660
Ladies and gentlemen,
please don't call them heroes,

27:43.729 --> 27:45.395
call them Legends.

27:45.464 --> 27:48.865
Now, let's see what daring do

27:48.934 --> 27:52.869
the Legends of Tomorrow
get into... today.

27:58.811 --> 28:01.011
And that'll teach those bad guys

28:01.079 --> 28:03.280
that crime doesn't pay.

28:03.348 --> 28:05.715
<i>Thanks for the assist,
Green Arrow.</i>

28:05.784 --> 28:07.651
<i>See you later, Supergirl.</i>

28:07.719 --> 28:09.953
Whoa!
Do you see that?

28:10.022 --> 28:12.522
That's the Flash,
and he wants to hang out.

28:12.591 --> 28:14.791
Should we got hang out?

28:18.497 --> 28:21.832
Break a leg, guys.

28:21.900 --> 28:24.601
Wait a second!
Shh.

28:24.670 --> 28:27.804
I think that I hear something.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.307
Monsters.

28:30.375 --> 28:31.808
What do you think, White Canary?

28:31.877 --> 28:32.909
Should we show 'em what we got?

28:32.978 --> 28:34.711
Wait, hold on.

28:34.780 --> 28:38.448
What if, instead of showing 'em
what we got,

28:38.517 --> 28:43.086
we ask them what they have?

28:43.155 --> 28:44.654
Hmm?

28:44.723 --> 28:47.190
You mean get to know them?

28:47.259 --> 28:49.993
What if, getting to know
them, we realize

28:50.062 --> 28:53.430
that we have nothing to fear.

28:53.498 --> 28:56.366
Minotaur, your passion is music.

28:56.435 --> 28:58.935
Why don't you show us
what you got?

29:00.305 --> 29:02.939
They said this was
a superhero show.

29:03.008 --> 29:04.908
These brats don't respect art.

29:07.279 --> 29:09.646
Hey, hey!
I think we're losing them.

29:13.919 --> 29:15.418
What was that?

29:26.331 --> 29:27.764
Bloody hell, I know that sound.

29:32.170 --> 29:35.939
Finally, a real-life dragon.

29:44.516 --> 29:45.782
Oh, no, is that...

29:45.851 --> 29:46.783
Wicksty?

29:50.822 --> 29:52.622
Now, this is a show.

29:55.127 --> 29:58.261
You really thought
you could stop us?

29:58.330 --> 30:00.196
These fools you brought here

30:00.265 --> 30:03.266
will only serve our hellish end.

30:03.335 --> 30:06.469
Everyone remain calm!

30:06.538 --> 30:09.506
This is all just, uh,
a part of the show.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.913
Damn it, Gary.

30:16.982 --> 30:19.449
Now I'm powerless.

30:20.719 --> 30:22.786
Enough...
Filling your heads with this

30:22.854 --> 30:25.055
silly, little morality play.

30:25.123 --> 30:27.958
Now all of you will
bear witness to the birth

30:28.026 --> 30:29.693
of a new era.

30:30.862 --> 30:32.162
She wants these people scared.

30:32.230 --> 30:33.997
They'll open up the portal
right here.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.373
This way.
Go, go!

30:43.442 --> 30:45.208
We got to get that staff.

30:50.582 --> 30:52.983
We got to get these kids
out of here, go!

30:54.920 --> 30:56.519
Follow them!

31:16.742 --> 31:18.575
Everybody, go back inside.

31:18.643 --> 31:19.876
Back inside!

31:38.163 --> 31:40.397
It's all right.
It's all right.

31:47.939 --> 31:49.839
Burn her.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.841
Burn them all.

32:04.689 --> 32:06.890
Stop!

32:06.958 --> 32:08.391
Stop.

32:10.395 --> 32:14.297
Burn the child.
Do it now.

32:14.366 --> 32:16.733
Kid, you got to run.

32:16.802 --> 32:18.735
Mithra, dance.

32:37.756 --> 32:39.656
No!

32:39.724 --> 32:41.458
Tabitha!

32:49.668 --> 32:51.668
Mithra, wait.

33:16.461 --> 33:18.761
Rise, my demon brethren.

33:18.830 --> 33:22.866
The door is open!
Rise!

33:22.934 --> 33:26.636
Oh, it's gonna take more than
a musical number to stop this.

33:37.001 --> 33:41.136
Neron! This fight is
between me and you,

33:41.205 --> 33:43.605
so let's settle it
once and for all.

33:45.609 --> 33:47.109
Gladly.

33:52.483 --> 33:56.719
I've already won.
Killing you is just a bonus.

33:56.787 --> 33:59.455
You may take me, Neron,

33:59.523 --> 34:02.157
but the Legends will always win.

34:03.794 --> 34:04.860
Ha.

34:13.304 --> 34:14.303
What's happening?

34:14.371 --> 34:15.904
Looks like the deal's off, mate.

34:21.911 --> 34:23.112
No.

34:26.784 --> 34:30.018
Nate?
No.

34:30.087 --> 34:31.553
Gideon, take us to HeyWorld.

34:31.621 --> 34:34.089
<i>I must advise against
that course of action.</i>

34:34.158 --> 34:36.391
<i>The change to your future
is still in progress.</i>

34:36.460 --> 34:38.060
<i>If you leave the temporal zone,</i>

34:38.129 --> 34:41.130
<i>your current memories
won't be safe.</i>

34:43.167 --> 34:45.400
You didn't.

34:45.469 --> 34:47.703
I'm sorry, love.
It was his choice.

34:56.781 --> 34:59.281
- Finish it off, John.
- Gladly.

35:14.565 --> 35:17.065
Come on, Ray.

35:17.134 --> 35:20.369
Raymond Palmer, I return
your soul to your body.

35:25.009 --> 35:27.209
What happened to me?
Where am I?

35:27.278 --> 35:29.011
I'm in HeyWorld?

35:30.614 --> 35:32.147
Everybody's here.

35:34.518 --> 35:36.452
No, Nate.
No.

35:36.520 --> 35:38.120
No!
Ray, Ray.

35:38.189 --> 35:40.355
- No, no, no.
- Ray, I'm so sorry.

35:40.424 --> 35:42.925
Nate, hey.

35:42.993 --> 35:44.827
- You can't be here.
- Come on.

35:44.895 --> 35:47.529
Hey.
Nate, you can't be dead.

35:47.598 --> 35:50.132
Come on.
Hey, come on, come on.

35:50.201 --> 35:51.467
Come on, you can't be...

35:51.535 --> 35:53.001
Bring him back to life, weasel!

35:53.070 --> 35:55.971
Oh, I wish I could, Rory,
but that requires magic

35:56.040 --> 35:57.673
beyond my means, mate.

36:15.493 --> 36:17.826
Not a bad show if you ask me.

36:19.763 --> 36:21.263
Dad.

36:21.332 --> 36:23.298
Hello, Nate.

36:24.702 --> 36:26.435
I missed you so much, Dad.

36:28.973 --> 36:31.039
I haven't been far.

36:33.010 --> 36:35.410
Oh, I guess, um...

36:35.479 --> 36:37.546
I guess it sucks...

36:37.615 --> 36:40.048
Dying before you're ready, huh?

36:40.117 --> 36:42.084
- Sure does.
- Yeah.

36:42.152 --> 36:44.119
Believe me, I went through
all the emotions...

36:44.188 --> 36:46.855
I mean, anger, worry...

36:46.924 --> 36:48.423
I had so many regrets,
I almost missed

36:48.492 --> 36:50.893
my ticket to the happy place.

36:50.961 --> 36:52.094
What changed?

36:52.162 --> 36:53.562
I had faith.

36:53.631 --> 36:54.963
You're saying
there's actually a...

36:55.032 --> 36:56.231
In you, Nate.

36:58.202 --> 37:01.136
And I was right
to believe that my boy

37:01.205 --> 37:04.239
and all his freaky buddies
would see this thing through.

37:06.710 --> 37:08.610
But you know
the only thing missing

37:08.679 --> 37:12.714
from that big show of yours?

37:12.783 --> 37:14.850
Music.

37:39.343 --> 37:40.709
James Taylor?

37:40.778 --> 37:42.311
I don't sing.

37:46.450 --> 37:49.051
I think someone from beyond
is trying to help us out.

37:51.755 --> 37:54.690

38:28.425 --> 38:30.125
that love can be energy, too.

38:32.229 --> 38:35.097
Everyone, if you want to see
Nate up and kicking,

38:35.165 --> 38:37.899
he needs to hear your voices
right now!

38:37.968 --> 38:40.736
We need everyone to hold hands.

38:40.804 --> 38:43.405
And we mean everyone.

38:43.474 --> 38:46.608
- Are we really doing this?
- Couldn't hurt.

38:46.677 --> 38:47.909

38:47.978 --> 38:49.778
We're part of
the circle this time.

38:52.249 --> 38:54.916

Yes!

39:53.143 --> 39:55.811
No.
No, no, no, no.

39:55.879 --> 39:57.112
You're not in the temporal zone.

39:57.181 --> 39:59.181
We changed history.
We changed everything.

39:59.249 --> 40:00.882
I couldn't let you die.

40:02.953 --> 40:04.486
No.

40:08.492 --> 40:11.093
Dude, you just came back
to life.

40:13.097 --> 40:14.529
Something's wrong.

40:14.598 --> 40:16.498
Um, there was more pelvis
in that hug than usual.

40:16.567 --> 40:19.367
It's all good, Nate dog.
Love you, too, bro.

40:21.472 --> 40:22.738
Yeah, my bad, bro.

40:22.806 --> 40:25.607
It just feels like... feels like
something's missing.

40:27.578 --> 40:29.144
Ray.
Aw, buddy.

40:31.215 --> 40:32.481
I can't believe you went
all the to hell

40:32.549 --> 40:33.915
to stop Neron from killing me.

40:33.984 --> 40:35.617
You would have done
the same thing.

40:35.686 --> 40:37.519
I kind of just did.

40:37.588 --> 40:38.954
Yeah, you did.

40:39.022 --> 40:40.388
Ah!

40:40.457 --> 40:43.191
All right, Time Bros...

40:43.260 --> 40:46.528
- Oh, and Time Ladies.
- And Time Monsters.

40:46.597 --> 40:48.697
And Gary?

40:48.766 --> 40:51.867
As I was saying, Legends...

40:51.935 --> 40:54.002
our work here is done.

40:54.071 --> 40:58.507
Gideon, fire up the ship.
It's time to hit it.

41:07.484 --> 41:09.151
I'm here to make a withdrawal.

41:11.522 --> 41:13.622
Whoa.

41:13.690 --> 41:16.992
These are some truly
serious sinners.

41:17.060 --> 41:19.694
Cut down too soon, all of them.

41:19.763 --> 41:23.031
It's a real shame when
someone doesn't get to...

41:23.100 --> 41:25.634
fulfill their destiny.

41:25.702 --> 41:27.235
Don't you think?

41:38.949 --> 41:42.784
Everyone deserves a second act.
