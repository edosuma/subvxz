00:01.502 --> 00:04.737
Sir, i'm gonna respectfully
decline intelligence.

00:04.739 --> 00:06.338
Wasn't the answer
i expected.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.007
(burgess)
my partner and i,

00:08.007 --> 00:09.675
We went through something
with that shooting.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.343
I'm not gonna leave him until
we can both put it behind us.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.644
I should have been there
to cover you at that house.

00:12.646 --> 00:14.747
You can't carry around
this guilt anymore, okay?

00:16.317 --> 00:19.051
You know, we no longer
work together,

00:19.053 --> 00:22.154
So a lot of the old rules
and regulations,

00:22.156 --> 00:24.323
They don't apply anymore.

[bottles clanking together]

00:38.439 --> 00:41.306
I need to rehydrate.

00:41.308 --> 00:43.475
That mean you're done?

00:43.477 --> 00:45.778
No.

00:45.780 --> 00:47.346
No, no, no, no.

00:47.348 --> 00:48.514
Just...

00:48.516 --> 00:51.283
In between rounds.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.696
Hmm.

01:04.697 --> 01:07.232
I need to
tell you something.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.400
You're married?

01:08.402 --> 01:11.437
Not quite.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.305
There's a...

01:13.307 --> 01:15.707
There's a lieutenant
in the zapata cartel

01:15.709 --> 01:17.342
Who's agreed to intro

01:17.344 --> 01:20.245
An undercover
into the organization.

01:20.247 --> 01:23.182
Lang wants us
down there asap.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.517
Where's "down there"?

01:25.519 --> 01:29.488
La paz, bolivia.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.391
We--we roll out tomorrow.

01:39.700 --> 01:43.402
I'm really happy for you.

01:47.341 --> 01:50.242
I still have 24 hours

01:50.244 --> 01:52.644
If you want to try and make
the most of it.

[cell phone trilling]

02:05.392 --> 02:08.360
We just caught
a crime scene.

[siren wailing]

02:22.776 --> 02:24.276
(bob)
neighbor heard gunshots.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.261
Called it in.

02:25.262 --> 02:26.245
So were you
the responding officer?

02:26.247 --> 02:27.412
I was.

02:27.414 --> 02:30.315
All right, bob, thanks.

02:30.317 --> 02:34.353
Oh, hey,
your kid's doing great.

02:34.355 --> 02:35.654
Hey, what's up, pops?

02:35.656 --> 02:37.422
Hey, they brought
in the big gun.

02:37.424 --> 02:38.857
I thought you switched
to days?

02:38.859 --> 02:41.560
Oh, i've been back on midnights
for a few months now.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.195
The city's prettier
at night.

02:43.197 --> 02:45.464
I should get in there.

02:45.466 --> 02:46.465
Yeah, me too, right?

02:46.467 --> 02:49.735
Yeah, of course.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.607
Lucy denton, the mom.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.209
Daughter's name is shelby.

02:57.211 --> 02:58.810
Lucy knew somebody
at the mayor's office,

02:58.812 --> 03:02.247
Which is why you guys
got called in, i guess.

03:02.249 --> 03:03.382
Husband live here?

03:03.384 --> 03:05.484
Yeah, wes denton,
husband and father.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.486
Don't know where he is,
doesn't answer his phone,

03:07.488 --> 03:09.421
And there's
an eight-year-old son, jordan.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.689
Don't know where he is.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.457
Silva from homicide
said they found casings

03:12.459 --> 03:14.226
From a smith & wesson.

03:14.228 --> 03:16.361
Same caliber registered
to wes denton.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.263
We found an open gun case open
in the master closet.

03:18.265 --> 03:19.515
Gun was gone.

03:19.516 --> 03:20.766
(atwater)
motion detectors
and window sensors...

03:20.768 --> 03:22.301
This is top-of-the-line
security system.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.535
Do you know if
the alarm was set?

03:23.537 --> 03:25.204
Technician tells me it is.

03:25.206 --> 03:27.806
So whoever entered
had access to code.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.875
Or they forced someone
to enter it.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.510
Yeah, or that.

03:31.512 --> 03:34.446
Hey, you get a ping
on the father's phone or gps?

03:36.250 --> 03:37.916
Got a location?

03:39.353 --> 03:41.753
I'm just the responding officer.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.389
So that's a no?

03:46.660 --> 03:48.277
Wow.

03:48.278 --> 03:49.895
They don't call it intelligence
for nothing, huh?

03:53.334 --> 03:54.700
Pops, come here.

03:54.702 --> 03:57.002
- What?
- What the hell was that?

03:57.004 --> 03:58.621
I know when i'm being
condescended to.

03:58.622 --> 04:00.239
What are you talking about?
That's just how he is.

04:00.241 --> 04:01.807
He asked you
a question, dad.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.275
He's also my sergeant.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.377
Intelligence is
my team, you know?

04:05.379 --> 04:08.413
The only person i heard
being condescending was you.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.523
(atwater)
yo, i got something.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.425
Yeah, what is it?

04:20.427 --> 04:22.961
- We got blood on the floor.
- Hmm.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.330
(atwater)
and we got this.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.301
How old did they say
the boy was?

04:29.303 --> 04:31.370
Eight.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.007
Patrol's got eyes on
the dad's car.

04:35.009 --> 04:37.342
All right, go tell everyone
the boy is injured,

04:37.344 --> 04:39.411
So we gotta move.

04:49.023 --> 04:49.788
That's it.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.028
Assume denton's armed,
but remember,

04:56.030 --> 04:57.729
We might have a kid in there.

04:59.033 --> 05:01.733
Copy.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.013
Clear.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.983
Hold up.

05:33.967 --> 05:37.803
All right, hit it.

05:37.805 --> 05:40.339
You leaving town?

05:40.341 --> 05:43.108
(wes)
hey, what are you guys doing?

05:43.110 --> 05:44.643
Wes denton?

05:44.645 --> 05:45.877
Yeah.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.079
Where's your son?

05:47.081 --> 05:48.580
What?

05:48.582 --> 05:50.582
What? Wh--home. Why?
What's happened?

05:52.052 --> 05:53.118
What's going on?

05:53.120 --> 05:54.786
There's been a crime.

06:03.764 --> 06:03.995
.

06:03.997 --> 06:06.365
Anyone in your wife's life
or your life

06:06.367 --> 06:07.844
That you were having
problems with?

06:07.845 --> 06:09.322
That would do this?
No.

06:09.323 --> 06:10.800
You own a smith & wesson,
correct?

06:10.804 --> 06:12.571
- That's right, i do.
- So where is it?

06:12.573 --> 06:14.106
- At the house.
- It's not at the house.

06:14.108 --> 06:17.709
Well, then,
i don't know where it is.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.846
Maybe, you know--maybe
whoever did this to my family,

06:20.848 --> 06:22.498
Maybe they took it.

06:22.499 --> 06:24.149
Wes, where's
your son, jordan?

06:25.853 --> 06:28.787
I already told you.
I don't know.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.555
Why did you have
all those clothes in the car?

06:30.557 --> 06:31.623
Where were you headed?

06:32.760 --> 06:35.627
Do i need a lawyer?

06:35.629 --> 06:36.895
(dawson)
why would you
need a lawyer, wes,

06:36.897 --> 06:38.530
If you haven't done
anything wrong?

06:38.532 --> 06:40.849
Because i feel like
you're pushing me

06:40.850 --> 06:43.167
In a direction
that is unthinkable and untrue.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.770
Why all the clothes?

06:44.772 --> 06:48.573
I was coming home from work
in fort wayne.

06:54.548 --> 06:56.114
According to your neighbors,
you're some big shot

06:56.116 --> 06:58.083
At hewlett-packard here
in chicago.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.851
I was laid off a year ago,

06:59.853 --> 07:01.820
And i've been picking up
freelance it work

07:01.822 --> 07:04.823
Installing server systems
at night.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.458
Why was your phone off
all day?

07:06.460 --> 07:07.859
My battery was dead.

07:07.861 --> 07:08.960
I forgot my charger.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.862
It's a three-hour drive home.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.164
Where's your son?

07:14.835 --> 07:18.837
I don't know.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.006
I don't know!

07:21.008 --> 07:23.575
Why don't i start asking you
that question?

07:23.577 --> 07:25.694
Or you!

07:25.695 --> 07:27.812
Isn't that your job,
or do you just sit around

07:27.815 --> 07:30.816
Accusing innocent people
of slaughtering their families?

07:36.089 --> 07:38.223
(roman)
this is jordan denton,
the missing boy.

07:38.225 --> 07:40.826
Intelligence found his bloody
prints in the back of the house,

07:40.828 --> 07:42.561
Which means he may have escaped.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.697
Let's canvass
the neighborhood.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.832
If jordan's out there,
odds are he's hurt and alone.

07:46.834 --> 07:50.235
It's on us to find him.

07:51.505 --> 07:52.804
You ready?

07:52.806 --> 07:54.206
Yeah, i'm thinking
you can take altgeld.

07:54.208 --> 07:55.240
I'll take montana.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.209
How about we do them
together?

07:57.211 --> 07:59.544
Sean, i'm good.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.148
That works too.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.188
Who's that?

08:10.190 --> 08:12.257
Your group supervisor.

08:15.796 --> 08:16.795
Erin lindsay.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.697
Jim anderoff.

08:18.699 --> 08:19.764
You're the number two here?

08:19.766 --> 08:20.765
I am.

08:20.767 --> 08:21.766
Where's lang?

08:21.768 --> 08:23.201
Oh, so you didn't hear.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.803
Well, it turns out
we're not the only ones

08:24.805 --> 08:26.805
Looking into
the zapata cartel.

08:26.807 --> 08:29.708
The fbi has been building a case
against them longer than us,

08:29.710 --> 08:32.010
So he got pulled to washington,

08:32.011 --> 08:34.044
I guess to hash it out
with his bosses.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.214
And no one told me?

08:36.216 --> 08:38.183
I just did.

08:39.152 --> 08:43.621
All right, folks,
renzo zapata.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.857
He is your reason for living.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.692
[phone trills]
rivers, what's up?

08:47.694 --> 08:49.995
All yours.

08:49.997 --> 08:53.231
Zapata has a compound
just outside of la paz,

08:53.233 --> 08:55.417
100 acres--

08:55.418 --> 08:57.602
Rivers at dea is pitching
a bitch about nadis checks.

08:57.604 --> 08:59.704
He wants to run everyone again
before we leave.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.307
[scoffs]

09:02.309 --> 09:03.708
Okay, fine.
We'll push the flight,

09:03.710 --> 09:05.877
So he can untwist his panties.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.546
But we're going in
one way or the other,

09:07.548 --> 09:08.847
So keep your phones on.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.853
Hey, you want to catch
a bite later?

09:14.855 --> 09:18.056
I'd love to pick your brain
more about renzo.

09:18.058 --> 09:21.126
I have a lot of things
to take care of before we leave.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.861
Let's do that
on the flight.

09:23.697 --> 09:25.864
Sure, no sweat.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.036
Any news on the missing boy?

09:31.038 --> 09:34.005
Got every available unit
out searching.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.675
Wes denton tested negative
for gunshot residue.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.612
Doesn't mean
he's not behind this.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.781
I don't know; marriages go south
and everything,

09:42.783 --> 09:44.716
But killing your own kids?

09:44.718 --> 09:47.085
There are some things
in this job, ruzek,

09:47.087 --> 09:49.888
Hopefully you'll never
understand.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.990
Turns out lucy denton
was an investigative journalist

09:51.992 --> 09:53.725
For <i> the chicago source.</i>

09:53.727 --> 09:55.126
Her job was
to antagonize people.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.728
Me and al
are gonna head down there.

09:56.730 --> 09:57.862
Sounds good.

09:57.864 --> 09:58.930
Kick denton?

09:58.932 --> 10:01.333
Yeah.

10:01.335 --> 10:02.867
Hey, sarge, you got a minute?

10:02.869 --> 10:04.869
You gonna ask about your dad?

10:04.871 --> 10:06.104
Yeah.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.338
(voight) then no,
i don't have a minute.

10:07.341 --> 10:09.074
We've got
an eight-year-old kid missing.

10:10.344 --> 10:11.776
All right.

10:13.814 --> 10:15.780
(jim)
her office is this way.

10:15.782 --> 10:18.617
Lucy went after anyone:
Big, small.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.685
If there was a good story,
it didn't matter.

10:20.687 --> 10:22.020
(dawson)
anyone ever threaten her?

10:22.022 --> 10:25.056
You should see some of
the letters that she got,

10:25.058 --> 10:27.759
Some of the things that subjects
said they'd do to her.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.511
So yeah,
there were threats.

10:29.512 --> 10:31.262
Well, we need to see
every letter and email.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.932
I can pull some of them up
for you right now.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.872
(olinsky)
oh, you know her password.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.207
Lucy and i were close.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.875
How close?

10:43.877 --> 10:47.379
I was here all night prepping
thursday's issue, detective.

10:47.381 --> 10:49.414
You want to talk to my staff?

10:50.884 --> 10:52.717
Hey, no offense,
but <i> the chicago source</i>

10:52.719 --> 10:55.286
Is not exactly
the <i> sun-times.</i>

10:55.288 --> 10:59.658
Lucy loved what she did
no matter who she worked for.

10:59.660 --> 11:02.827
Writing for papers
is a dying industry.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.864
Everyone's just trying to pay
their bills at this point.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.266
She ever talk about her husband,
life at home?

11:08.268 --> 11:13.271
Lucy exposed other people's
lives, never her own.

11:23.750 --> 11:24.949
Holy crap.

11:24.951 --> 11:26.785
Disco bob is in the house.

11:26.787 --> 11:29.087
Good to see you, trudy.

11:29.088 --> 11:31.388
What the hell got you out of
the comfy confines of the 26th?

11:31.391 --> 11:33.158
Did you lose a bet
or something?

11:33.160 --> 11:34.392
I'm here to see voight.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.728
Okay, come on.
I'll buzz you up.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.063
No,
he can come down here.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.798
Okay.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.802
(platt)
nadia, send voight down.

11:43.804 --> 11:46.771
He's got a visitor.
Thanks.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.075
- Hey.
- How you doing?

11:51.211 --> 11:53.211
Done well for yourself,
hank.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.412
I thought when you got locked up

11:54.414 --> 11:55.747
That would be
the end of it, but...

11:55.749 --> 11:56.948
You need something, bob?

11:56.950 --> 11:59.784
Yeah,
last night at the crime scene,

11:59.786 --> 12:02.087
I noticed this guy,
a bystander.

12:02.089 --> 12:04.456
I cruised back by
the denton house this morning,

12:04.458 --> 12:05.990
And he's still leaning
on the tape.

12:05.992 --> 12:07.325
- Hmm.
- I know that killers

12:07.327 --> 12:09.461
Sometimes like to visit
their own crime scenes,

12:09.463 --> 12:12.464
So i went up to him,
got his name.

12:12.466 --> 12:15.133
Alexander gage.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.871
All right,
we'll look into it.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.940
- Thanks.
- Hey.

12:21.941 --> 12:24.008
I never weighed in about you and
adam when he got assigned here.

12:24.010 --> 12:26.845
I figured it was short-term,
but...

12:26.847 --> 12:28.313
Looks like it might stick,
huh?

12:30.317 --> 12:31.816
So far so good.

12:31.818 --> 12:33.384
All right.

12:33.386 --> 12:36.521
Well, then i'm gonna say this
to your face:

12:36.523 --> 12:38.923
You send him down a bad road,

12:38.925 --> 12:40.925
And i'm gonna meet you
behind district

12:40.927 --> 12:42.393
And break your jaw.

12:45.899 --> 12:49.467
I think we both know
what's going on here, bob.

12:49.469 --> 12:53.071
And i want you to know
i have said one word to adam

12:53.073 --> 12:54.806
About terrino's.

12:57.177 --> 13:00.245
You heard what i said.

13:05.185 --> 13:08.953
(atwater)
alexander gage, chicago pd!

13:11.925 --> 13:12.991
Clear.

13:15.195 --> 13:18.496
(halstead)
clear.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.198
Whoa.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.535
[camera clicking]

13:27.541 --> 13:30.441
[keyboard clacking]

13:34.281 --> 13:35.814
This dude was stalking her,
man.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.553
Call the tac team and get them
to sit on this apartment.

13:41.555 --> 13:42.554
- Copy that.
- Hold on.

13:42.556 --> 13:44.823
(halstead)
alexander gage?

13:44.825 --> 13:46.424
Stop!

13:46.426 --> 13:47.859
Chicago pd!

13:51.932 --> 13:52.964
(halstead)
damn it.

14:21.928 --> 14:23.595
Jay!

14:23.597 --> 14:24.996
(atwater)
jay!

14:31.104 --> 14:33.071
I didn't kill them.

14:33.072 --> 14:35.039
Yo, kevin,
you can set him down now.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.510
Look, people think their words
don't have any power,

14:39.512 --> 14:41.012
But hers did.
She ruined me.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.113
Keep your hands on the chair.

14:42.115 --> 14:43.114
I had a business.
I had a family.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.916
I had workers.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.184
You know what they do to them,
'cause they're all illegals?

14:46.186 --> 14:47.518
Tell me.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.120
I do time,
they get sent back to mexico,

14:49.122 --> 14:50.588
All because she want to be
susie reporter

14:50.590 --> 14:52.657
For some paper
nobody reads anymore.

14:52.659 --> 14:53.792
So you're gonna follow her?

14:53.793 --> 14:54.926
You're gonna wait
for the perfect moment

14:54.928 --> 14:56.211
And make her pay?

14:56.212 --> 14:57.495
The bitch was cheating
on her husband,

14:57.497 --> 14:58.897
And i wanted to expose her.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.398
Get him up.
Let's go.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.966
Let's go.

15:06.473 --> 15:07.973
.

15:07.974 --> 15:09.474
The guy was definitely stalking
lucy denton,

15:09.475 --> 15:10.975
But he wanted to humiliate her.
He wanted her alive to do that.

15:10.977 --> 15:12.510
That's what he's claiming,
anyway.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.245
Yeah, we're tracking down
another person of interest,

15:14.247 --> 15:16.648
Some ambulance chaser that lucy
was probably sleeping with.

15:16.650 --> 15:19.050
Look, you think there's
something to this lawyer angle,

15:19.052 --> 15:21.953
Run it down,
but gage stays in custody.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.288
(trudy)
her palm scanner didn't work,

15:23.290 --> 15:25.456
Red-faced,
big-time.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.326
I had to buzz her up.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.560
(lindsay)
thank you again, sergeant.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.095
[laughter]

15:32.565 --> 15:34.065
I know.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.434
I'm like the loser
that graduates from high school

15:36.436 --> 15:38.503
And then hangs around
in the parking lot all the time,

15:38.505 --> 15:40.071
'cause i have nothing better
to do.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.411
They treating you all right
over there?

15:46.413 --> 15:47.679
Absolutely.

15:47.681 --> 15:49.981
Anything changes,
you'll let me know, right?

15:51.985 --> 15:53.251
You care.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.986
Yeah.

15:54.988 --> 15:57.689
[laughs]

16:03.630 --> 16:05.296
(halstead)
hey.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.665
You guys got a good one
going here?

16:07.667 --> 16:11.636
Yeah, we'll see.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.271
When--
when are you heading out?

16:13.273 --> 16:17.308
My flight got pushed a day.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.512
How long you gonna be
down there?

16:23.350 --> 16:26.384
Six months...
Give or take.

16:26.386 --> 16:29.420
We could roll out at
any time.

16:32.692 --> 16:34.058
Hey, man.

16:34.060 --> 16:35.626
Atwater got an address
for that lawyer.

16:35.628 --> 16:37.128
I'll be right there.

16:46.339 --> 16:49.607
Take care of yourself
down there, all right?

16:53.646 --> 16:57.348
Jay, i don't have
a crystal ball. Do you?

16:57.350 --> 16:59.250
Can we just agree
that we don't know what happens

16:59.252 --> 17:03.688
Down the road?
And maybe we keep an open mind.

17:10.463 --> 17:13.431
Deal.

17:22.308 --> 17:24.809
Lucy did a piece
on insurance scams.

17:24.810 --> 17:26.377
She interviewed me;
we stayed in touch.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.713
I was helping her file
chapter 11.

17:28.715 --> 17:32.350
What does a p.I. Attorney know
about filing for bankruptcy?

17:32.352 --> 17:34.352
Lucy couldn't afford
the basic 2 grand fee

17:34.354 --> 17:35.686
At a typical
bankruptcy firm.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.121
I was doing it as a friend.

17:37.123 --> 17:38.756
How did she pay you?

17:38.758 --> 17:40.291
Not how you're implying.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.260
Believe me.
They were broke.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.295
I felt sorry for her.

17:44.297 --> 17:45.363
I stopped by a few times

17:45.365 --> 17:47.098
And helped her fill out
the paperwork.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.599
Always when her husband
was out?

17:48.601 --> 17:51.803
She didn't want him to know
about the bankruptcy.

17:51.805 --> 17:54.205
They'd sold off everything
of value.

17:54.207 --> 17:56.207
They were trying to get out
from under the house...

17:56.209 --> 17:57.842
These were desperate people.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.710
Are we talking
a quiet desperation,

17:59.712 --> 18:02.280
Or were they locking horns?

18:02.282 --> 18:04.816
There was some arguing
going on there, yeah.

18:04.818 --> 18:07.685
Enough for wes to kill lucy?

18:07.687 --> 18:10.288
I've heard of crazier things.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.857
But to kill
your daughter too?

18:16.496 --> 18:19.197
(burgess)
you know, we could cover
more ground if we split up.

18:19.199 --> 18:23.167
Two sets of eyes
are better than one, right?

18:24.737 --> 18:26.504
I got this.

18:27.307 --> 18:31.209
It's--it's like riding a bike.

18:37.383 --> 18:38.716
Hi, i'm officer burgess.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.718
This is officer roman.
We're here about--

18:40.720 --> 18:41.886
Shelby.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.589
Yeah,
do you know shelby denton?

18:44.591 --> 18:47.458
We used to be best friends.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.328
We did cheer together.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.296
Then she transferred
to public school this year,

18:52.298 --> 18:55.366
So we didn't see each other
so much.

18:56.503 --> 18:58.870
It seems her younger brother,
jordan, is missing.

18:58.872 --> 19:01.506
Anything you could tell us
would be helpful.

19:01.508 --> 19:03.274
Have you talked
to owen yet?

19:03.276 --> 19:04.442
Owen?

19:04.444 --> 19:06.544
(megan)
her boyfriend--or ex-boyfriend.

19:06.546 --> 19:08.446
You never knew with them.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.314
This owen got a last name?

19:10.316 --> 19:13.351
Reese.
Owen reese.

19:15.555 --> 19:18.156
Kid's been holed up in his room
since he heard the news.

19:18.158 --> 19:19.524
Sad.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.192
Only met shelby a few times.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.728
She seemed like
a sweet girl.

19:23.730 --> 19:26.364
Owen,
the police want to talk.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.366
Hey, mr. Reese,
where was your son last night?

19:28.368 --> 19:29.834
In his room.

19:29.835 --> 19:31.301
Got caught drinking
two weeks ago.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.570
He's been grounded
ever since.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.472
I even took
his car keys.

19:34.474 --> 19:35.540
(roman)
hey, owen.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.441
We're looking
for jordan denton.

19:37.443 --> 19:39.777
He's alive?
We're hoping.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.679
But with every minute,
the chances decrease.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.447
We know you were over there
a lot.

19:43.449 --> 19:44.448
How well do you know him?

19:44.450 --> 19:46.484
He's a good kid,
looked up to me.

19:46.486 --> 19:49.387
I mean, sometimes he'd...

19:49.389 --> 19:51.389
Sometimes he'd what?

19:51.391 --> 19:53.324
Tell them.

19:53.326 --> 19:55.193
You've got to understand.

19:55.195 --> 19:56.561
Shelby hated being home.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.796
Her parents
were always fighting.

19:58.798 --> 20:02.433
Shelby and me, we had this spot
we used to go to,

20:02.435 --> 20:04.302
This foreclosed house
a couple blocks from hers,

20:04.304 --> 20:07.438
To get away.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.608
Jordan followed us in there
a few times.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.510
Give us the address.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.990
Police.
Anyone down here?

21:19.479 --> 21:21.045
(jordan)
[coughs]

21:21.047 --> 21:22.313
Over there.

21:22.315 --> 21:23.314
Jordan!

21:23.316 --> 21:24.382
(burgess)
oh, my god.

21:28.421 --> 21:29.887
2113 squad emergency.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.389
You got him?

21:31.391 --> 21:33.057
Inform chicago med
we are en route

21:33.059 --> 21:35.926
With a tender-age male,
gunshot wound to the shoulder.

21:35.928 --> 21:36.994
He's lost a lot of blood.

21:40.900 --> 21:41.332
.

21:41.334 --> 21:43.434
All right.
Thanks, roman.

21:43.435 --> 21:45.535
(halstead)
okay, so jordan's alive,

21:45.538 --> 21:46.937
But he's critical
and heading into surgery now.

21:46.939 --> 21:49.473
(ruzek)
all right,
we like the dad for this.

21:49.475 --> 21:50.908
I just got off the phone
with dentons' bank.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.544
Got $800 in savings.
Credit cards are maxed out.

21:53.546 --> 21:56.013
They're on their second
mortgage.

21:56.015 --> 21:59.717
(atwater)
both wes and lucy denton have
$500,000 life insurance policies

21:59.719 --> 22:01.402
Taken out when they were flush.

22:01.403 --> 22:03.086
Wes' lapsed.
Kept the premium paid on lucy's.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.588
And with double indemnity,

22:04.590 --> 22:06.457
Wes denton is gonna get
paid out $1 million.

22:06.459 --> 22:07.892
Look, i hate to ruin
the party here,

22:07.894 --> 22:09.994
But i cross-referenced
all the subscribers

22:09.996 --> 22:11.762
And mudd and tolls
on wes' phone.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.347
Nothing stood out.

22:13.348 --> 22:14.931
Tech lab checked all
the searches and the activity

22:14.934 --> 22:16.734
On the home computer,
nothing.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.669
So if he hired someone
to kill his wife,

22:18.671 --> 22:19.670
He was careful.

22:19.672 --> 22:20.838
So he was careful.

22:20.840 --> 22:21.839
We got financial motive
for the husband.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.040
We need to bring him in.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.642
Well, he ain't coming in
voluntarily again.

22:24.644 --> 22:25.943
I'll tell you that much.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.479
(olinsky)
if wes hears we found his kid

22:28.481 --> 22:30.681
And he might get id'd,
he'll bolt.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.817
(dawson)
plus, to me,
he looks like one of those guys

22:32.819 --> 22:34.452
Whose mouth starts moving
when they feel the bracelets

22:34.454 --> 22:35.586
Slapped on their wrists.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.825
Let's hit it.

22:40.827 --> 22:43.794
Let's go.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.530
(roman)
hey, al.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.566
What's the deal with voight
and my dad?

22:48.568 --> 22:49.867
I'm not looking
for a fairy tale.

22:49.869 --> 22:50.868
I just...

22:50.870 --> 22:52.069
Oh, man,
that was a long time ago.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.105
15 years?

22:54.107 --> 22:55.906
A bunch of us were at
a retirement party

22:55.908 --> 22:57.908
For this guy,
eddie terrino.

22:57.910 --> 23:00.745
Voight was knee-deep
in the gang unit at that time.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.513
Your dad had a couple
of cocktails in him,

23:02.515 --> 23:04.014
And he starts making
some comments

23:04.016 --> 23:05.916
About voight being dirty.

23:05.918 --> 23:08.085
So now everyone was trying to,
you know,

23:08.087 --> 23:10.654
Calm him down,
but your dad kept right it,

23:10.656 --> 23:11.922
Really kept at it.

23:11.924 --> 23:14.492
So, voight, he had
a couple cocktails in him.

23:14.494 --> 23:17.061
He gets up,
and he calls your dad a dog cop.

23:19.132 --> 23:21.399
Huh.

23:21.401 --> 23:24.535
You know, kid,
there are cops

23:24.537 --> 23:26.670
Who want to be the first
through that door,

23:26.672 --> 23:29.173
And there are cops who want
to keep traffic flowing.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.809
Everybody chips in different.

23:31.811 --> 23:34.445
Now, if your old man
wants to clock in and clock out

23:34.447 --> 23:39.016
On a decent beat,
i got zero problem with that.

23:39.018 --> 23:43.654
So that whole evening
at terrino's was...

23:43.656 --> 23:46.056
Regrettable.

23:52.899 --> 23:54.932
(wes)
guys, we're asking you
to please,

23:54.934 --> 23:58.702
Please come back here or call in
if you find anything,

23:58.704 --> 24:00.438
No matter how small it is,

24:00.440 --> 24:02.673
That might indicate
what direction he went in.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.875
(roman)
mr. Denton, we've got to ask you
a few more questions.

24:04.877 --> 24:06.944
(olinsky)
and it might be better
if we conduct this privately.

24:06.946 --> 24:08.913
Yeah, i'm leading a search
for my son.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.698
We can see that.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.482
(wes)
so if you have something to ask,
either grab a flashlight

24:12.485 --> 24:15.152
And a flyer and find my boy,
but do not come here

24:15.154 --> 24:17.955
And waste my time
when i have none left.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.191
Sir, please.

24:20.193 --> 24:21.559
All right, let's back it up.

24:21.561 --> 24:22.726
Do you see what he's doing?

24:22.728 --> 24:24.161
Do you guys see this?

24:24.162 --> 24:25.595
(bob) hey, what the hell
is going on here?

24:25.598 --> 24:26.964
(roman)
dad, walk away.
All right, we got this.

24:26.966 --> 24:27.965
Do you?

24:27.967 --> 24:28.966
What about that guy
i gave voight?

24:28.968 --> 24:30.501
I said we got it.

24:30.503 --> 24:32.536
If we need any more
of your help, we'll call you.

24:32.538 --> 24:34.839
All right?

24:54.994 --> 24:57.027
They got the dad
downstairs in the cage.

24:57.029 --> 24:58.929
You give him anything
on the ride over?

24:58.931 --> 25:01.198
Not a word.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.801
Any word on the boy?

25:04.971 --> 25:06.971
Still in surgery.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.890
Money makes people do
crazy things.

25:25.892 --> 25:28.959
Not enough or too much--
it doesn't seem to matter.

25:28.961 --> 25:31.562
What does that have to do
with anything?

25:31.564 --> 25:33.964
Forget to mention
when we spoke before

25:33.966 --> 25:35.966
You and your wife
were about to go broke?

25:35.968 --> 25:37.902
It's immaterial.

25:37.904 --> 25:40.037
No, that's motive.

25:40.039 --> 25:44.074
See, you have a need to be seen
a certain way: Successful.

25:44.076 --> 25:45.810
That's why you killed lucy.

25:45.811 --> 25:47.545
You found out
she filed for bankruptcy.

25:47.547 --> 25:49.613
No, no.
None of this is true.

25:49.615 --> 25:51.766
You were out of runway,

25:51.767 --> 25:53.918
So you figure you'd cash in
on her life insurance policy,

25:53.920 --> 25:55.185
The one you're
making payments on

25:55.187 --> 25:57.621
When you can barely
afford groceries.

25:57.623 --> 26:01.692
Lucy must have been
paying those premiums.

26:01.694 --> 26:05.329
Besides which, none of this
makes me a murderer.

26:05.331 --> 26:08.799
Do yourself a favor.

26:08.801 --> 26:10.801
Tell me how you
set this thing up

26:10.803 --> 26:12.303
And the state's attorney
will thank you

26:12.305 --> 26:15.172
By giving you a life sentence
with possibility.

26:15.174 --> 26:17.841
I didn't do this!

26:19.045 --> 26:22.012
I was trying to hold
my family together.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.647
Guess what?
We found your son--

26:23.649 --> 26:26.850
Half-conscious,
bullet in his shoulder,

26:26.852 --> 26:28.953
Clinging to life.

26:28.955 --> 26:30.120
He's in surgery now.

26:30.122 --> 26:31.322
I-i have to see him.

26:31.324 --> 26:32.656
Not yet.

26:32.658 --> 26:34.592
Please, you can't keep me
from my boy.

26:34.594 --> 26:36.327
I got a court order
keeps you from seeing him.

26:36.329 --> 26:37.895
He needs his father.

26:37.897 --> 26:39.229
What's he gonna tell us

26:39.231 --> 26:41.832
If he makes it through
this surgery, hmm?

26:44.971 --> 26:47.705
This is your last chance
to get out in front of this.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.211
What happened?

26:57.950 --> 27:00.751
I want to see my lawyer.

27:00.753 --> 27:03.287
Now.

27:11.897 --> 27:12.129
.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.482
(halstead)
before they went bust, they
donated to a lot of charities.

27:14.483 --> 27:16.834
They were on the board
of directors at the o.G. Grill.

27:16.836 --> 27:18.335
It's a catering company
up on the north side

27:18.337 --> 27:19.737
That hires ex-cons.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.238
Yeah, they teach them
food service skills.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.940
I got a cousin
that went through there.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.892
A couple cousins, actually,
and my aunt.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.843
(halstead)
right, well, it's a good place
to hire a parolee

27:26.846 --> 27:28.212
Looking to do a murder for hire.

27:28.214 --> 27:30.014
It's worth checking out.
What's the address?

27:30.016 --> 27:32.282
I know how to get there.
We can roll.

27:41.260 --> 27:43.827
(atwater)
sir...

27:43.829 --> 27:45.396
Atwater, dawson,
chicago pd.

27:45.398 --> 27:47.231
You are?

27:47.233 --> 27:48.399
Russell moore.
I'm the manager.

27:48.401 --> 27:50.234
And unless you're looking
for catering,

27:50.236 --> 27:52.453
I got nothing to say to you.

27:52.454 --> 27:54.671
Hey, a couple of your volunteers
were murdered two nights ago,

27:54.674 --> 27:57.841
Lucy denton
and her daughter, shelby.

27:57.843 --> 27:59.977
The dentons used to
come around every sunday.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.013
I haven't seen them
in a while.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.048
(atwater)
you ever notice wes denton
rapping with your employees

28:04.050 --> 28:05.949
In an extra-curricular
kind of way?

28:05.951 --> 28:08.385
Rich family gets killed,
you think one of my guys did it?

28:08.387 --> 28:10.387
Yeah, basically.

28:12.158 --> 28:14.258
(dawson)
we're not trying to knock
what you're doing here, russell.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.827
But we need your help.

28:16.829 --> 28:18.429
How?

28:18.431 --> 28:21.265
Employee photos going back
two years.

28:24.136 --> 28:26.070
All right, i got all
the pictures of the ex-cons

28:26.072 --> 28:27.104
Working at the kitchens.

28:27.106 --> 28:28.472
We can do a photo array.

28:28.474 --> 28:30.207
Perfect.

28:31.711 --> 28:33.410
Sergeant hank voight,

28:33.412 --> 28:35.279
Talia davis
with child's advocate center.

28:35.281 --> 28:37.281
Anything you want to ask jordan,
i need to be there.

28:37.283 --> 28:39.116
You're up to speed
on the case?

28:39.118 --> 28:41.251
I'll break the news
about his mother and sister.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.087
But if i feel like he needs
to take a breather...

28:43.089 --> 28:46.423
I'll be doing the talking.

28:47.359 --> 28:48.358
- How you doing?
- Hey.

28:48.360 --> 28:52.129
Hey.

28:52.131 --> 28:55.833
My mom heard a noise
and told me to hide.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.202
I did,
but when i heard yelling,

28:58.204 --> 29:00.971
I got scared and ran out.

29:00.973 --> 29:03.974
The man chased me,
shooting.

29:06.245 --> 29:08.178
Had you ever seen
this man before?

29:08.180 --> 29:09.813
No.

29:09.815 --> 29:14.218
Did my mom and shelby
go to the hospital too?

29:14.220 --> 29:16.120
(roman)
you know, jordan,

29:16.122 --> 29:18.822
I've met a lot of brave people
in my life,

29:18.824 --> 29:20.524
But you, pal,
i'd say you're the bravest.

29:20.526 --> 29:23.360
You know what i mean?

29:23.361 --> 29:26.195
(voight)
jordan, we've got some pictures
we want you to look at, okay?

29:26.198 --> 29:30.167
I want you to just tell me
if one of these guys

29:30.169 --> 29:32.936
Is the man who was in
your house.

29:40.212 --> 29:41.211
Are you okay, jordan?

29:41.213 --> 29:43.213
He's fine.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.153
(jordan)
[labored breathing]

29:52.258 --> 29:53.257
Is that him?

29:53.259 --> 29:54.458
Jordan,
is that the man you saw?

29:56.095 --> 29:57.895
Sergeant,
can you step outside?

29:57.897 --> 29:59.263
Just tell me, jordan.

29:59.265 --> 30:00.197
(talia)
sergeant.

30:00.199 --> 30:01.198
Jordan, is--

30:01.200 --> 30:03.233
Yes, that's him.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.002
(roman)
got it.

30:05.004 --> 30:07.271
[touch-tones beeping]

30:11.177 --> 30:12.910
You're safe now.

30:19.852 --> 30:21.985
(jim)
all right, folks, new deal.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.021
Until things get sorted out
in d.C.,

30:24.023 --> 30:25.956
The feds are taking the lead
on this case.

30:25.958 --> 30:28.392
[people groaning]

30:28.393 --> 30:30.827
But the hell if they're gonna
take all the credit.

30:30.830 --> 30:32.129
We're still going in.

30:32.131 --> 30:34.298
It's just more
of a backseat capacity.

30:34.300 --> 30:37.000
Hey, you guys have a problem
with getting paid

30:37.002 --> 30:39.369
Chillin' poolside
in 70-degree temps?

30:39.371 --> 30:41.338
[laughter]
yeah, i didn't think so.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.874
Look, for now,
i can only take along six agents

30:43.876 --> 30:45.209
So if you need to drop out,
let me know.

30:45.211 --> 30:47.411
Otherwise, i'm making up
the roster on my own.

30:47.413 --> 30:49.112
If it's a boondoggle,
i'll stay--

30:49.114 --> 30:50.547
Your skills are needed.

30:50.549 --> 30:52.482
Oh, okay.

30:52.484 --> 30:54.551
Yeah, the informant's wife
needs to be babysat,

30:54.553 --> 30:56.887
So keep an eye on her.

30:56.889 --> 30:59.423
Go with her to get her hair
done, nails done, whatever.

30:59.425 --> 31:00.624
[laughter]

31:00.626 --> 31:03.293
All right, guys,
keep me posted.

31:10.402 --> 31:13.503
Frank carriger did five years
for aggravated burglary

31:13.505 --> 31:15.038
And narcotics possession.

31:15.040 --> 31:16.206
When he was released,

31:16.208 --> 31:18.942
His p.O. Got him a job
at the o.G. Grill.

31:18.944 --> 31:21.144
I put out an investigative alert
on him.

31:21.146 --> 31:22.479
Any lkas for this guy?

31:22.481 --> 31:24.414
Yeah,
i got his last three.

31:24.416 --> 31:25.983
Yeah, we still can't find
any communication

31:25.985 --> 31:27.451
Between him and wes denton.

31:27.453 --> 31:31.054
What about between him
and lucy's stalker, gage?

31:31.056 --> 31:32.706
Zero.

31:32.707 --> 31:34.357
(voight)
well, somebody gave carriger
that alarm code.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.492
(atwater)
copy that. Thanks.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.361
We might have eyes on carriger.

31:37.363 --> 31:39.329
Loyola station,
boarding the el right now.

31:39.331 --> 31:41.431
Beautiful.

31:46.205 --> 31:51.275
Witness said he's wearing jeans
and a black leather jacket.

31:57.383 --> 31:59.616
- I don't see him.
- Me neither.

31:59.618 --> 32:01.184
I'll take the back car.

32:01.186 --> 32:02.185
We'll start up front,
and meet you in the middle.

32:02.187 --> 32:04.087
All right.

32:18.337 --> 32:20.270
Excuse me.

32:20.272 --> 32:21.238
Excuse me.

32:21.240 --> 32:24.174
Excuse me.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.209
Got him.
He just exited the train.

32:26.211 --> 32:27.444
- Chicago pd!
- Excuse me!

32:27.445 --> 32:28.678
- Get out of the way!
- Out of the way!

32:30.416 --> 32:31.982
He's running down the platform!

32:31.984 --> 32:33.500
(woman) hey, move it.
- Watch out!

32:33.501 --> 32:35.017
Suspect's heading down
the station to ashland and lake.

32:36.422 --> 32:39.189
[siren wailing]

32:39.191 --> 32:42.659
(olinsky)
there. That's him.

32:42.661 --> 32:44.161
All right, i got him.

32:48.167 --> 32:50.367
Out of the way!

32:50.369 --> 32:52.235
Hey, watch it!

33:14.226 --> 33:16.293
(electronic voice)
door is closing.

33:23.502 --> 33:25.068
[horn blares]

33:26.205 --> 33:27.604
Damn!

33:36.615 --> 33:38.315
Aah!

33:38.317 --> 33:39.583
[shouts]

33:39.585 --> 33:41.051
Stay down.

33:41.053 --> 33:42.652
Put your arms behind your back.

33:42.654 --> 33:44.454
You like shooting kids,
huh?

33:44.456 --> 33:46.556
Owen reese,
the girl's boyfriend.

33:46.558 --> 33:48.358
He had me do it.
He had me do it.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.527
(roman)
get up.

33:59.405 --> 33:59.636
.

33:59.638 --> 34:03.240
See, owen gave me
the alarm code.

34:03.242 --> 34:06.543
He said they have money
and jewelry lying around.

34:07.679 --> 34:11.782
And we drove by,
and he showed me the house,

34:11.784 --> 34:15.185
And yeah,
i believed him.

34:16.422 --> 34:18.422
But when i got in there,
they didn't have nothing.

34:18.424 --> 34:21.658
I found the gun,

34:21.659 --> 34:25.429
I woke those bitches up,

34:25.431 --> 34:29.399
And marched them down
in the living room,

34:29.400 --> 34:31.534
And i gave them a choice.

34:38.143 --> 34:40.777
Why did you put him up to it?

34:47.186 --> 34:50.687
We can sit here for days, kid.

34:50.688 --> 34:52.556
I make good money overtime.

34:54.193 --> 34:56.426
Carriger's laying it
all out in there.

34:56.428 --> 34:57.861
One guy gets to make a deal.

34:57.863 --> 34:59.096
The one who keeps
his mouth shut,

34:59.098 --> 35:00.781
He's gonna take a ride.

35:00.782 --> 35:02.465
You keep sitting there
with your thumb in your ass,

35:02.468 --> 35:03.767
It's over.

35:03.769 --> 35:07.637
Hey, aggravated home invasion,
double murder,

35:07.639 --> 35:11.108
And attempted murder
of a tender-age boy.

35:11.110 --> 35:12.776
You hear that?

35:12.778 --> 35:15.412
You will be charged
for all of that.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.287
I met shelby at the grill.

35:28.727 --> 35:31.628
Mrs. Denton thought i wasn't
good enough for her daughter.

35:31.630 --> 35:35.432
I swear, i didn't think
he'd kill them.

35:35.434 --> 35:37.667
I told him to go in
when they were sleeping,

35:37.669 --> 35:39.369
Scare shelby's mom.

35:39.371 --> 35:41.371
So she'd run back into
your arms?

35:41.373 --> 35:43.540
Mrs. Denton should have
told him the truth,

35:43.542 --> 35:45.308
Given frank what he wanted.

35:45.310 --> 35:48.278
(halstead)
they were broke.

35:48.279 --> 35:51.247
Shelby's parents didn't tell her
they were gonna lose the house.

35:59.625 --> 36:03.360
I loved her.

36:06.665 --> 36:11.601
Today was harder than
i thought it was gonna be.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.338
I had a feeling
you weren't ready.

36:17.676 --> 36:20.544
I'm ready.

36:20.546 --> 36:23.380
The problem is,
you're not.

36:23.382 --> 36:25.649
Look, i know that you think
that you're looking out for me,

36:25.651 --> 36:29.352
But you can't do this job
if you're always worried.

36:29.354 --> 36:32.556
And i can't do my job
if i'm worried about you...

36:32.558 --> 36:33.757
Worrying about me--

36:33.759 --> 36:35.759
Worry--wha--okay.

36:35.761 --> 36:38.828
No--ugh,
you get the point.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.699
We're the police.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.301
The second we start
doubting each other,

36:44.303 --> 36:46.970
It's both of us
lying on the pavement.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.438
You're right.

36:48.440 --> 36:51.474
You got shot.
It happened, but you're back.

36:51.476 --> 36:52.642
Exactly.

36:52.644 --> 36:53.877
And to commemorate you
not worrying about me

36:53.879 --> 36:55.312
Not worrying about you
not worrying--

36:55.314 --> 36:56.813
I get it.
Hilarious.

36:56.815 --> 37:00.684
What better way to bury
the past than...

37:00.686 --> 37:01.785
I got you this.

37:01.787 --> 37:03.486
Oh, my old vest!

37:03.488 --> 37:05.755
Hey, the thing kept us
from losing our best customer.

37:05.757 --> 37:08.258
We couldn't just
throw it out.

37:09.461 --> 37:11.761
Thanks.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.330
Welcome back, partner.

37:13.332 --> 37:15.298
Thanks, roman.

37:21.807 --> 37:23.340
[laughs]

37:31.250 --> 37:32.782
Hey.

37:37.756 --> 37:40.857
It's never fun,
you know,

37:40.859 --> 37:45.862
Looking at family members
as suspects.

37:45.864 --> 37:48.665
The upside is,
sometimes they're innocent.

37:50.936 --> 37:55.939
I'm sorry for your loss

37:55.941 --> 37:57.941
And for what we
put you through.

37:57.943 --> 38:01.878
[sighs]

38:01.880 --> 38:06.549
I never even knew shelby
had a boyfriend.

38:06.551 --> 38:11.421
If i'd--
i'd been around more, maybe--

38:11.423 --> 38:13.957
You were trying to support
your family.

38:15.694 --> 38:18.061
Listen, i can...

38:19.865 --> 38:22.666
I can tell jordan about your
wife and daughter if you want.

38:22.668 --> 38:24.868
Sometimes it's easier
coming from the police.

38:28.373 --> 38:29.906
I'm all he has now.

38:32.444 --> 38:34.811
He should hear it from me.

39:01.640 --> 39:02.639
Pops.

39:02.641 --> 39:03.707
Hey.

39:03.709 --> 39:04.808
Could i get a beer or something?

39:04.810 --> 39:05.909
- Sure.
- Thanks.

39:05.911 --> 39:07.977
Hey.

39:07.979 --> 39:09.612
Hey. Hey, listen.
Thanks for meeting me.

39:09.614 --> 39:10.780
Oh, of course.

39:10.782 --> 39:14.751
Listen,
about last night--

39:14.753 --> 39:16.853
Oh, no, it's done.
I'm over it.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.823
No, no, no, i...You know,
i didn't mean it like that.

39:19.825 --> 39:21.424
I just was all worked up,

39:21.426 --> 39:23.793
And i must have sounded
like an ass, so...

39:23.795 --> 39:27.597
Thank you.
I'm sorry.

39:27.599 --> 39:31.034
Adam...

39:31.036 --> 39:35.438
The night you were born
and i held you in my arms,

39:35.440 --> 39:36.873
I made a decision.

39:36.875 --> 39:39.576
It was more important to me

39:39.578 --> 39:43.113
To be your dad
than to be a cop.

39:44.683 --> 39:47.684
So i transferred to the 26th,
and i stayed in uniform.

39:47.686 --> 39:50.553
Did i make all the busts
that voight did?

39:50.555 --> 39:53.089
No.

39:53.091 --> 39:56.826
But i was there to coach
your teams

39:56.828 --> 40:00.997
And drive you to school,
take you to the movies.

40:02.868 --> 40:07.937
I wanted to come home
to my son every night.

40:13.111 --> 40:15.478
I didn't know that.

40:15.480 --> 40:17.614
Thanks, dad.

40:19.885 --> 40:23.486
I-i heard once that

40:23.488 --> 40:26.756
A man's greatest achievement

40:26.758 --> 40:29.793
Is when his son becomes
more successful than him.

40:29.795 --> 40:31.694
[laughs]

40:31.696 --> 40:34.631
I just want to know that
you're happy where you're at.

40:34.633 --> 40:37.000
I am.

40:37.002 --> 40:38.768
I like being the first
through the door.

40:38.770 --> 40:39.903
That's the kind of cop i am.

40:39.905 --> 40:43.540
I like doing it
in this unit.

40:43.542 --> 40:46.176
You know, i wouldn't want
to be anywhere else.

40:54.753 --> 40:57.687
[knocking at door]

41:02.894 --> 41:04.761
[knocking at door]

41:04.763 --> 41:07.197
[safety clicking]

41:07.199 --> 41:09.566
[knocking resumes]

41:17.843 --> 41:20.910
(lindsay)
hank, put the gun down.
It's me.

41:22.614 --> 41:24.614
You lose your key?

41:24.616 --> 41:26.950
It's been a rough day.
I didn't want to get shot too.

41:30.555 --> 41:31.988
Is it too late to get
my spot back in intelligence?

41:34.059 --> 41:38.027
This task force,
it's all politics

41:38.029 --> 41:39.929
And a numbers game
and...

41:39.931 --> 41:41.931
And the way that
they just chew people up

41:41.933 --> 41:43.266
And then spit them
back into the system--

41:43.268 --> 41:45.001
This isn't me.

41:45.003 --> 41:47.537
This has never been me.

41:47.539 --> 41:50.573
I became a cop to try to bring
a little justice to this city--

41:50.575 --> 41:52.075
To <i> my</i> streets
the way you taught me.

41:52.077 --> 41:53.910
Welcome back.

41:56.047 --> 41:58.548
I'm all yours.

41:58.550 --> 42:01.751
Hey, come here.

42:01.753 --> 42:02.752
Thank you.

42:02.754 --> 42:05.021
You kiddin'?

42:05.023 --> 42:07.790
You seen the faces
i gotta look at every morning?

42:07.792 --> 42:10.226
[laughs]
yeah.

42:47.933 --> 42:50.934
