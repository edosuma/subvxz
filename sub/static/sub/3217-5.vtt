-She's garbage. Man, they all are.

31:46.779 --> 31:49.489
We can push them.
We can make them do whatever we want.

31:52.160 --> 31:55.162
Are you really this stupid? Is it--?

31:55.330 --> 31:59.291
You learn you got a twin,
you call him up.

31:59.459 --> 32:02.586
You go out for a drink.
You don't start killing people.

32:02.754 --> 32:06.089
I wanted to tell you for so long, bro.

32:06.257 --> 32:10.594
But he didn't let me.
He said I had to wait until the time--

32:10.762 --> 32:13.305
-Who?
-The man with the yellow eyes.

32:16.476 --> 32:17.768
What are you talking about?

32:17.936 --> 32:21.813
He came to me, in my dream.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.149
He said I was special.

32:25.985 --> 32:28.862
He told me he's got big plans for me.

32:29.030 --> 32:31.490
Wait till you see what's in store,
Andy, for both of us.

32:33.368 --> 32:36.745
See, he's the one who told me
that I had a brother.

32:37.956 --> 32:39.039
A twin.

32:45.713 --> 32:49.216
Why did you kill our mother?
And why Dr. Jennings?

32:49.384 --> 32:50.717
Because they split us up!

32:52.929 --> 32:54.805
They ruined our lives, Andy.

32:55.390 --> 32:57.182
We could have been together
this whole time.

32:58.685 --> 33:00.727
Instead of alone.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.230
I couldn't let them do that.

33:03.439 --> 33:07.693
I couldn't let them get away with that.
No.

33:18.788 --> 33:19.871
I see you.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.334
Bye-bye.

33:31.134 --> 33:32.551
[GUNSHOT]

33:59.954 --> 34:01.955
ANDY:
He shot himself.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.332
[ECHOING]
And you all saw it happen.

34:06.711 --> 34:09.004
Yeah. We did.

34:10.255 --> 34:12.424
Look at him. He's getting better at it.

34:20.183 --> 34:22.684
EMT:
You'll be okay, miss.

34:30.777 --> 34:32.944
Won't even look at me.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.655
Yeah, she's pretty shaken up.

34:35.864 --> 34:40.159
No, it's-- This is different. This is, uh....

34:40.828 --> 34:44.998
I never used my mind thing on her
before last night.

34:47.877 --> 34:49.878
She's scared of me now.

34:54.967 --> 35:00.555
Andy, I hate to do this, but, um,
we have to get out of here.

35:00.723 --> 35:01.765
[SCOFFS]

35:01.933 --> 35:04.601
Here. I wrote down my cell.

35:05.269 --> 35:06.937
You don't have to be alone in this.

35:07.105 --> 35:11.316
If anything comes up, you call me up.

35:16.697 --> 35:18.532
Wha...? What...?

35:18.699 --> 35:21.660
-What am I supposed to do now?
-You be good, Andy.

35:23.538 --> 35:24.746
Or we'll be back.

35:33.297 --> 35:34.965
Looks like I was right.

35:35.133 --> 35:37.134
-About what?
-Andy.

35:37.301 --> 35:39.511
He's a killer after all.

35:40.304 --> 35:43.223
No, he's a hero.
He saved his girlfriend, he saved my life.

35:43.391 --> 35:45.517
Bottom line, last night,
he wasted somebody.

35:47.019 --> 35:48.895
He's not a foaming-at-the-mouth psycho.

35:49.355 --> 35:51.690
He was just-- He was pushed into that.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.984
Webber was pushed, in his own way.

35:54.485 --> 35:57.070
Max Miller was pushed.
I was pushed by Jessica's death.

35:57.238 --> 35:58.321
What's your point?

35:58.489 --> 36:01.241
Right circumstances,
everyone's capable of murder.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.704
Maybe that's what the demon's doing,
pushing us, finding ways to break us.

36:05.872 --> 36:07.789
We don't know what
the demon wants, okay?

36:08.541 --> 36:10.333
Quit worrying about it.

36:11.377 --> 36:14.337
I heard you before, Dean,
when Andy made you tell the truth.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.883
-You're just as scared of this as I am.
-That was mind control.

36:18.050 --> 36:20.260
It's like being roofied, man.
It doesn't count.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.304
-What?
-No, I'm calling do-over.

36:22.471 --> 36:23.805
-Are you 7?
-Doesn't matter.

36:23.973 --> 36:27.142
We gotta keep doing what we're doing,
find that evil son of a bitch and kill it.

[CELL PHONE RINGING]

36:30.771 --> 36:32.397
Yeah. I guess.

36:35.193 --> 36:36.276
Hello?

36:37.862 --> 36:40.614
Ellen, what's going on?

36:42.617 --> 36:44.701
Yeah, we'll be right there.

36:51.876 --> 36:55.295
Jo, go pull up another case of beer.

36:55.504 --> 36:58.590
-Mom--
-Now. Please.

37:01.260 --> 37:05.764
So you, uh, wanna tell me
about this last hunt of yours?

37:06.307 --> 37:07.766
DEAN:
No, not really.

37:10.102 --> 37:12.771
No offense.
It's just kind of a family thing.

37:14.023 --> 37:15.732
Not anymore.

37:16.525 --> 37:17.776
I got this stuff from Ash.

37:20.988 --> 37:23.657
Andrew's house burned down
on his 6-month birthday...

37:23.824 --> 37:25.116
...just like your house.

37:25.284 --> 37:28.745
You think it was the demon both times.
It went after Gallagher's family?

37:29.664 --> 37:30.956
-Yeah, we think so.
-Sam.

37:31.123 --> 37:32.666
-Why?
-None of your business.

37:33.626 --> 37:35.293
You mind your tongue with me, boy.

37:35.461 --> 37:37.379
This isn't just your war, this is war.

37:37.546 --> 37:39.506
Something big and bad is coming,
and fast.

37:39.674 --> 37:42.801
Their side holds all the cards.
Now, at best, all we got is us.

37:43.636 --> 37:47.347
Together. No secrets or half-truths here.

37:52.395 --> 37:54.521
SAM:
There are people out there.

37:54.689 --> 37:56.940
Like Andy Gallagher.

37:58.776 --> 38:00.443
Like me.

38:04.532 --> 38:06.533
And we all have some kind of ability.

38:06.701 --> 38:09.327
-Ability?
-Yeah. Psychic ability.

38:11.247 --> 38:16.209
Me, I have, um, visions.

38:17.628 --> 38:22.215
Premonitions. I don't know,
it's different for everybody.

38:24.135 --> 38:27.637
The demon said he had plans
for people like us.

38:27.805 --> 38:30.181
-What kind of plans?
-We don't know for sure.

38:30.349 --> 38:33.059
These people out there, these psychics.
They dangerous?

38:33.227 --> 38:35.687
No. Not all of them.

38:35.855 --> 38:37.814
But some are. Some are very dangerous.

38:37.982 --> 38:41.318
-How many of them we looking at?
-We've been able to track a pattern.

38:41.485 --> 38:44.529
They had house fires
the night of the kid's 6-month birthday.

38:44.697 --> 38:47.407
-That's not true.
-What?

38:48.367 --> 38:53.747
Webber, or Anson Weems,
or whatever his name is.

38:55.124 --> 38:58.585
I looked at his files,
and there was no house fire.

38:58.753 --> 39:00.462
There's nothing out of the ordinary.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.548
Which breaks pattern.

39:03.716 --> 39:06.634
If there's others like him,
there'd be nothing in the system.

39:07.428 --> 39:09.471
No way to track them all down.

39:10.639 --> 39:13.058
So who knows how many of them
are really out there?

39:14.935 --> 39:16.227
-Jo, honey.
-Yeah?

39:16.854 --> 39:18.646
Better break out the whiskey instead.
