Great, we're all here.

00:10.845 --> 00:12.244
What's this all about?

00:12.246 --> 00:13.746
We're gonna look at everything we know

00:13.748 --> 00:14.847
about Erik and Kate's disappearance,

00:14.849 --> 00:16.482
and try to make sense of it all.

00:16.484 --> 00:17.649
Sal helped me put this together.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.351
(girl) Yay, Sal.

00:19.353 --> 00:22.755
(laughter)

00:22.757 --> 00:24.823
Why is it doing that? I
found it on your phone,

00:24.825 --> 00:27.159
and I thought everyone should see it.

00:27.161 --> 00:28.227
Boy's got moves!

No! Just go!

Come on, hey, make it
stop, this is serious.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.435
All right, Erik and Kate were last seen

00:36.437 --> 00:37.503
at the opera house.

00:37.505 --> 00:39.004
We found a note there
in Kate's handwriting

00:39.006 --> 00:42.207
that said one word... "Saganash."

00:42.209 --> 00:44.510
A family that the Hunters did
business with centuries ago.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.845
Tess talked to an old guy named Rinus

00:46.847 --> 00:48.147
who used to work here.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.449
But he kind of got mad at
her before she could...

00:50.451 --> 00:52.051
learn anything.

00:52.053 --> 00:54.553
Wasn't my fault, and I
did learn something.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.355
The Saganash family is still around,

00:56.357 --> 00:57.890
and they're dangerous.

00:57.892 --> 01:00.092
Rinus said we shouldn't get involved.

01:00.094 --> 01:02.094
And then we got a message
on the telegraph machine

01:02.096 --> 01:06.331
signed "E & K," said they needed help.

01:06.333 --> 01:10.169
How does it all fit together?

01:10.171 --> 01:12.738
Well, it all has to be connected,

01:12.740 --> 01:14.506
but there are too many gaps

01:14.508 --> 01:16.075
to pull anything together.

01:16.077 --> 01:18.010
I hate this! I don't wanna be talking

01:18.012 --> 01:19.578

already bought the paint.

rolled your ankle.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.952
I do about 400 of these every day.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.924
Every day. Keep it up, man.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.058
Yeah.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.259
(shorts ripping)

12:08.261 --> 12:10.195
(laughter)

12:32.419 --> 12:34.552
(Tess) I don't like the look of this.

12:34.554 --> 12:37.055
Somebody was tied up in here.
Two people.

12:39.192 --> 12:40.358
Back up, old man!

12:40.360 --> 12:42.093
I know karate and jiu jitsu

12:42.095 --> 12:44.129
and a few other Japanese words.

12:44.131 --> 12:45.864
You...

12:45.866 --> 12:47.799
You're the Hunter girl.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.901
That's right. And you're Rinus.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.936
What are you doing here?
Where are Erik and Kate?

12:51.938 --> 12:53.171
You tell me.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.372
What?

12:54.374 --> 12:55.840
You're not holding them prisoner?

12:55.842 --> 12:58.676
Why should I do something like that?

12:58.678 --> 13:02.147
Would you mind not shining
that thing in my eyes?

13:02.149 --> 13:03.581
Well, how did you get this?

13:03.583 --> 13:07.218
You searched my coat?

13:07.220 --> 13:09.154
So, if you didn't take Erik and Kate,

13:09.156 --> 13:10.755
what are you doing here?

13:10.757 --> 13:12.490
The same as you. I'm looking for them.

13:12.492 --> 13:14.459
How do you even know they're missing?

13:14.461 --> 13:19.197
After your little visit,
I tried to call Erik

13:19.199 --> 13:22.200
a bunch of times. His phone was dead.

13:22.202 --> 13:25.136
So, I watched the house, but
I didn't see them there.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.305
You spied on us?

13:27.307 --> 13:30.475
No, not on you. I was looking for them.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.243
Listen, I... I discovered that

13:32.245 --> 13:34.245
they were last seen at the opera.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.147
And the guy at the opera told me

13:36.149 --> 13:37.982
a taxi brought 'em here.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.686
I don't buy it. Look at him,

13:41.688 --> 13:43.021
he won't even look us in the eye.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.223
How can I when you're blinding me

13:45.225 --> 13:47.158
all the time with that light?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.727
Listen, I've known Erik

13:49.729 --> 13:53.731
since he was a boy. I
practically raised him.

13:53.733 --> 13:57.468
You know, Kate and Erik,
they mean everything to me.

13:57.470 --> 14:00.538
And you kids, you mean
everything to them.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.473
So, we're in this together.

14:03.677 --> 14:07.245
So, let's help each other find them.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.983
I believe him.

14:11.985 --> 14:16.621
The note on the photo we found
did say he was almost a Hunter.

14:18.158 --> 14:19.991
Yeah, I guess I believe him too.

14:19.993 --> 14:21.259
(scoffs) Max!

14:21.261 --> 14:23.261
Oh, sorry.

14:31.404 --> 14:32.937
I've searched the place,

14:32.939 --> 14:35.807
but my eyes aren't
what they used to be.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.010
(Max) What's this?

14:39.012 --> 14:40.578
(Tess) A notebook?

14:44.117 --> 14:48.152
It's blank. This is interesting.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.358
♪♪

14:59.332 --> 15:00.965
Hi again.

15:03.737 --> 15:06.704
S-sorry. (clears throat, laughs)

15:10.677 --> 15:12.844
Here you go.

15:12.846 --> 15:14.279
Thanks, Simone.

15:14.281 --> 15:15.980
It was either this or arrest you

15:15.982 --> 15:17.315
for indecent exposure.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.252
Guess I'll be... heading home.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.922
I'll walk with you.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.757
I'm gonna need my jacket back.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.759
Right.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.994
You actually look
pretty good in a skirt.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.798
I've been told I have really nice legs.

15:33.800 --> 15:34.933
(laughs)

15:34.935 --> 15:36.434
Come on.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.372
(machine whirring)

15:44.778 --> 15:47.645
We just needed more pressure!

15:47.647 --> 15:49.747
12 bars ought to do it!

15:51.351 --> 15:53.384
Ma'am, I'm on my way, but I
might be five minutes late.

15:53.386 --> 15:56.087
Just have to make a quick
stop to check on the kids.

15:56.089 --> 15:59.924
Shouldn't it be doing something
besides making noises?

15:59.926 --> 16:01.392
Pressure needs to build.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.295
(doorbell rings)

16:16.743 --> 16:18.676
(machine whirring)

16:19.746 --> 16:22.747
I guess I just like helping people.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.684
That's not good.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.119
Max?

16:31.825 --> 16:34.158
Max? Are you here?

16:36.563 --> 16:38.963
Here it comes.

16:38.965 --> 16:42.400
Three... two... one...

16:42.402 --> 16:43.468
Max?

16:54.814 --> 16:58.349
Is everything all right in here?

17:03.723 --> 17:06.290
Why is our front door open?

17:06.291 --> 17:09.227
Is... is that Simone's bike?

17:10.630 --> 17:12.696
(sighs)

17:12.699 --> 17:15.299
Well, it was nice knowing you.

17:15.300 --> 17:16.768
What?

17:16.770 --> 17:21.539
Would someone please tell
me where your parents are?

17:24.109 --> 17:26.944
I want some answers!
Are they even here?!

17:29.015 --> 17:31.883
Daniel?!

17:31.885 --> 17:33.384
Well?

17:33.386 --> 17:35.119
Tim's a pretty sharp guy.
I'm sure by now,

17:35.121 --> 17:36.988
he's found out the truth
about Erik and Kate.

17:36.990 --> 17:38.456
I'm gonna go pack my bags.

17:38.458 --> 17:39.657
Stop overreacting.

17:39.659 --> 17:40.925
I'm not overreacting!

17:40.927 --> 17:42.360
I've been down this road before, okay?

17:42.362 --> 17:45.963
I'm history. We all are.

17:45.965 --> 17:48.800
They wouldn't just split you
kids up like that, would they?

17:48.802 --> 17:50.301
Mister, these guys may act

17:50.303 --> 17:51.869
all nice and concerned, but
at the end of the day,

17:51.871 --> 17:53.504
it's all about covering their backs.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.306
When they figure out Erik
and Kate are missing,

17:55.308 --> 17:57.842
pfft, we're... we're done.

17:57.844 --> 18:01.446
I wish there was something
I could do to help.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.815
Maybe there is.

18:03.817 --> 18:05.516
I hate to be that guy,

18:05.518 --> 18:08.186
but you guys aren't leaving
me a lot of choice.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.221
Now, either somebody tells me
what's going on or else I'll...

18:10.223 --> 18:13.091
How may I help you?

18:13.093 --> 18:14.926
Are you are?

18:14.928 --> 18:17.028
Casper Hunter. Erik's older brother.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.765
Much older, I'd say.

18:20.767 --> 18:25.036
Yes, yes, yes, it's true
I'm no spring chicken.

18:25.038 --> 18:28.005
Good thing you are all
so easy to take care of,

18:28.007 --> 18:29.607
or I wouldn't be able to handle it

18:29.609 --> 18:33.211
every time Erik and Kate
ask me to look after you.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.879
Where are Erik and Kate?

18:34.881 --> 18:37.448
Didn't the children tell you?

18:37.450 --> 18:41.219
Why are you keeping it a secret, huh?

18:41.221 --> 18:44.122
They're out of town on
an unexpected trip.

18:44.124 --> 18:47.859
Sort of a... a very important...

18:47.861 --> 18:51.229
archeological finding, you know?

18:51.231 --> 18:54.065
Now, how come no one has
offered this gentlemen...

18:54.067 --> 18:55.500
Tim.

18:55.502 --> 18:58.402
How come no one has offered Mr.
Tim some clean clothes?

18:58.404 --> 19:00.004
Where are your manners?

19:00.006 --> 19:03.107
Sorry... Uncle Casper.

19:03.109 --> 19:06.544
Well, I'm glad somebody
is looking after them.

19:06.546 --> 19:09.080
Yes, well, of course. (chuckles)

19:09.082 --> 19:11.349
You don't think Kate and Erik

19:11.351 --> 19:13.351
would leave them all alone, do you?

19:13.353 --> 19:15.686
No, of course they wouldn't.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.855
I don't know what I was thinking.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.190
(Anika) Yeah.

19:22.228 --> 19:23.928
Thanks for letting me borrow these.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.229
No worries.

19:25.231 --> 19:26.731
Anything for the Timster.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.099
(chuckles)

19:28.101 --> 19:30.601
Are you sure you don't want
me to wash your clothes?

19:30.603 --> 19:32.436
Um... I wouldn't.

19:32.438 --> 19:35.039
Laundry isn't exactly
Daniel's strong suit.

19:35.041 --> 19:37.575
It's okay.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.043
I should get moving.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.578
I've got an appointment in 20 minutes,

19:40.580 --> 19:42.580
and have to bike all
the way across town.

19:44.050 --> 19:46.250
I'm gonna be seriously late.

19:46.252 --> 19:47.818
Why don't you let me give you a ride?

19:47.820 --> 19:50.021
I can get a car from the station.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.522
It's just around the corner.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.624
I don't wanna put you out. You're not.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.927
I'm almost off duty anyway.

19:55.929 --> 19:59.697
Well, then... okay.

19:59.699 --> 20:00.998
Thanks.

20:02.902 --> 20:06.170
See ya, Daniel. Take
care of those legs.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.306
(chuckling) Yeah.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.074
Long story. I'll tell you in the car.

20:10.076 --> 20:11.909
I can't wait.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.588
You really used to work here?

20:23.590 --> 20:26.257
Yes, for years and years.

20:26.259 --> 20:29.060
I'm more confused than ever!
Who took Erik and Kate?

20:29.062 --> 20:30.561
Why haven't they contacted us?

20:30.563 --> 20:32.630
Don't kidnappers usually want a ransom?

20:32.632 --> 20:34.632
And what about all that
Saganash business?

20:34.634 --> 20:35.933
You know something about Saganash.

20:35.935 --> 20:37.201
(Tess) Yeah, you got really mad

20:37.203 --> 20:38.469
when I thought your name was Saganash.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.870
Come on, tell us.

20:39.872 --> 20:41.205
Why would Kate write down that name?

20:41.207 --> 20:43.841
And who leaves a blank notebook behind?

20:53.886 --> 20:55.152
It isn't blank.

20:57.423 --> 20:59.523
What are you doing?

20:59.525 --> 21:02.059
The writer used some
kind of invisible ink.

21:05.331 --> 21:07.531
(sniffs) From the smell,

21:07.533 --> 21:10.001
I'd say carboxylate.

21:12.872 --> 21:14.138
(Max) What's it say?

21:15.908 --> 21:20.311
"The fight will rage forever
over Josephine's one true love."

21:20.313 --> 21:22.613
What's that mean?

21:22.615 --> 21:24.382
Who's... who's Josephine's
one true love?

21:24.384 --> 21:26.450
Who's Josephine?

21:26.452 --> 21:29.153
Do we have any clue
whose notebook this is?

21:34.894 --> 21:36.027
Mm-hmm.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.463
Saganash?

21:39.465 --> 21:42.099
I'm afraid so.
