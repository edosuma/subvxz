Leon: Sheriff Miller?
It's your wife, sir. She's dead.

00:06.049 --> 00:08.834
I'm Evelyn Barret. I'm the new
sheriff of Willard's Mill.

00:08.878 --> 00:12.142
Every sheriff we've ever had
has died an early, violent,

00:12.186 --> 00:14.927
horrible death.

Except Stan.

twice each year.

00:21.238 --> 00:23.414
There's five of them.Should we get
a new map now?

00:23.458 --> 00:25.982
When the first flowers bloom,
the portal will open,

00:26.026 --> 00:28.854
and the Land of the Dead shall
corrupt the Land of the Living.

00:28.898 --> 00:30.465

I'm going to be able to do that
