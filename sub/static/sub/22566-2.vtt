I'll give you a tour.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.667
IAN:
I'm ready to work hard.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.103
BRIA:
I'm ready to work hard.

15:36.203 --> 15:38.838
Here as always, safety first.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.440
If you have a,
a big day at work

15:40.540 --> 15:42.575
you don't get anything done
but you stay safe

15:42.675 --> 15:43.876
that's a good day, okay?

15:43.977 --> 15:46.980
If you see somebody getting
their clothing or body part

15:47.080 --> 15:50.517
caught in this line here,
hit the kill switch.

I know a few people in town,
but not very well.

I know a few people in town,
but not very well.

16:39.299 --> 16:42.469

My cousin is helping me
with the transition.

My cousin is helping me
with the transition.

IAN:
I have a daughter.
I love her very much.

BRIA:
I have a daughter.
I love her very much.

16:54.081 --> 16:57.150
Her mother was a dear friend.
She died in a car accident.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.587
She didn't have
any other family.

17:02.489 --> 17:06.693
Adopting her was the best
decision I ever made.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.795
KAYLA:
Fuck you, you're the worst
person I've ever met

17:08.895 --> 17:12.332
in my entire fucking life!
Hope you fucking die!

17:12.432 --> 17:15.102
BRIA:
Being a mother is the most
rewarding role in life.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.669
KAYLA:
I would still be with my dad!

17:16.769 --> 17:19.639
Now, I'm never gonna be fine
because fucking...

17:21.308 --> 17:22.709
IAN:
How do you feel?

17:25.345 --> 17:27.580
This all seems so silly.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.584
Well, it's not, it's...
It-it works.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.220
Just takes some time.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.088
BRIA:
How much time?

17:43.296 --> 17:45.098
You can trust me.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.402
I don't have a choice.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.571
MAN 8:
Have a look at this.
This is the motherboard.

18:24.671 --> 18:27.907

Sterilizes the cans, fills 'em.

18:28.007 --> 18:29.776
Puts the tops on.

18:29.876 --> 18:31.578
So we wanna make sure
and monitor this thing

18:31.678 --> 18:33.780
make sure they all get
12 ounces.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.448
No more, no less.

18:35.548 --> 18:36.983
After you're here
for a year or two

18:37.083 --> 18:38.418
if you wanna take
the training program

18:38.518 --> 18:40.320
it's a little bit
more advanced

18:40.420 --> 18:41.754
than some
of the other positions.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.925
IAN:
You'll be in a class
of maybe 40.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.260
KAYLA:
So how far is it?

18:47.360 --> 18:49.362
IAN:
It's about a 15-minute walk
from here.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.498
But I'll be here
to take you every morning

18:51.598 --> 18:53.866
and to bring you back
at the end of every day.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.902
KAYLA:
I can just walk it now.
It's not a big deal.

18:56.002 --> 18:59.706
IAN:
Well...as a precaution

18:59.806 --> 19:01.674
you'll go with me,
you know, for your safety

19:01.774 --> 19:04.110
and further on down the line,
you can go by yourself.

19:04.211 --> 19:05.612
KAYLA:
So, how am I supposed
to explain

19:05.712 --> 19:07.280
who you are
to all my teachers?

19:07.380 --> 19:09.682
- Well, I'm your cousin.
- I'm tired.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.654
You tired, sweetie?
You wanna watch some TV?

19:14.754 --> 19:16.689
I think we're gonna watch TV
and get to bed.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.327
Okay.

19:20.427 --> 19:21.961
I know when I'm bein'
told to leave.

19:22.061 --> 19:24.831
No, no, no, you've been...
I'm sorry.

19:24.931 --> 19:27.200
You've been so great all day
with me and Kayla

19:27.300 --> 19:28.701
I-I think we're just, uh...

19:28.801 --> 19:30.069
It's been a long day, so, we're
just getting tired, I think.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.137
No, it's fine.

19:31.238 --> 19:33.206
We need to go to sleep,
you know.

19:33.306 --> 19:34.741
No. It is-it is fine.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.709
So, Kayla, I'll see you
tomorrow for schooling

19:36.809 --> 19:39.011
and, Bria,
we can talk later tonight.

19:39.111 --> 19:41.548
Probably, tomorrow we'll talk.

19:41.648 --> 19:45.318
I'm gonna go straight
to sleep...after TV.

19:47.254 --> 19:50.790
IAN:
All right, well, ladies,
make sure to get some rest.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.261

Goodbye.

You're such a fucking cunt!

20:39.205 --> 20:41.341
As soon as I find a way
to get home, I'll make sure

20:41.441 --> 20:43.876
he finds you
and he fucking kills you!

for another 45 minutes.

Yeah, this is Lola.

Glad you called.

Well, I wasn't sure if you
responded to my post.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.630
Thank you.

23:22.134 --> 23:23.536
Yeah.

23:32.244 --> 23:35.582
Yeah, sorry, my daughter
was in the other room asleep

23:35.682 --> 23:39.418
but I'm in my bedroom now,
so I can talk properly.

23:43.656 --> 23:46.459
Yeah, I love her very much.

23:46.559 --> 23:48.728
She was my
best friend's daughter

23:48.828 --> 23:51.531
but she died
in a car accident...

23:53.065 --> 23:56.603
...and, no, she had
no one else to go to

23:56.703 --> 24:00.106

looking after her.

Yeah, it's really tough, but...
