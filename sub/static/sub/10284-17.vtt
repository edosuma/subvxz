00:05.867 --> 00:07.449
Previously on ER...

00:07.666 --> 00:08.959
Alex, what happened?

00:09.007 --> 00:11.528
No, you can't break and steal
things, Alex. You know that.

00:11.537 --> 00:13.782
Are you sending me to live
with Grandma and Grandpa?

00:14.409 --> 00:16.190
That's who I used to be,
it's not who I am anymore.

00:16.204 --> 00:19.350
No, it's okay. It's no big deal.
I won't be a part of this.

00:19.387 --> 00:22.239
Have Crenshaw get me a surgeon
who actually wants to operate.

00:22.421 --> 00:23.736
Leaving so soon?

00:24.600 --> 00:26.696
Did your drunk ass hit that kid?

00:26.955 --> 00:29.870
Look, you talk about raising K.J.
to be honest, right?

00:30.064 --> 00:31.643
My dad's going away, isn't he?

00:32.436 --> 00:34.483
A secret engagement will be fun.

00:45.184 --> 00:47.502
When is the last time you
actually went to mass?

00:47.529 --> 00:49.850
That doesn't matter.
It's-it's a tradition.

00:49.877 --> 00:52.802
- Not mine.
- Churches are beautiful.

00:53.005 --> 00:54.283
A little bit creepy.

00:54.296 --> 00:56.930
I don't hear you making
any suggestions.

00:57.128 --> 01:01.421
Well, the only thing I know for sure
is that I don't want...

01:01.657 --> 01:04.552
it to even remotely resemble
my first wedding.

01:04.575 --> 01:05.473
Okay.

01:05.706 --> 01:08.860
- Where was your first wedding?
- In his parents' backyard.

01:09.168 --> 01:10.860
- You?
- A church.

01:11.208 --> 01:14.023
Uh, did you wear tule or taffeta?

01:14.475 --> 01:16.973
What do you know about tule or taffeta?

01:17.248 --> 01:19.901
- You going soft on me?
- I read about them online. Look...

01:19.918 --> 01:20.813
tell you what.

01:20.945 --> 01:24.961
Why don't you plan the wedding,
and I'll plan the real important stuff,

01:25.007 --> 01:27.250
- like the honeymoon, hmm?
- Okay. - Yeah?

01:29.837 --> 01:32.032
She needs debridement
and IV antibiotics.

01:32.078 --> 01:34.061
Admit to surgery, we'll do it in the OR.

01:34.067 --> 01:36.993
Ma'am, we're gonna admit you
so we can fix these bedsores, okay?

01:37.227 --> 01:41.272
May I present the esteemed Dr. Neela Rasgotra.
Neela, I want you to say hi to Mae Lee Park.

01:41.285 --> 01:43.520
- She's our new surgical med student.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.462
- Heard a lot about you.
- Oh, great.

01:45.498 --> 01:46.752
- All good, I hope.
- More or less.

01:46.778 --> 01:49.721
We left out the part about you being
our unwanted ER stepchild.

01:49.738 --> 01:51.612
- Hi, I'm Ray Barnett.
- Pleasure.

01:51.748 --> 01:54.840
Mae Lee published a paper
with Dr. Zimmer up at UCSF.

01:54.876 --> 01:57.370
I jumped at the opportunity
to snap her up.

01:57.927 --> 02:00.472
Anyhow, well, that pretty much
concludes our official tour.

02:00.485 --> 02:04.352
- I so appreciate you taking the time.
- Well, it's my pleasure.

02:05.128 --> 02:06.603
We should probably get out of here.

02:07.177 --> 02:09.130
I need you to sign off on
my obstructed CF'r.

02:09.155 --> 02:11.403
I've never seen
a transduodenal choledochostomy.

02:11.418 --> 02:13.830
Yeah, me neither.
Sounds cool.

02:14.816 --> 02:16.420
Didn't know we were getting a new sub-i.

02:16.655 --> 02:19.613
Really?
I'm shocked you weren't notified.

02:19.675 --> 02:21.363
You should bring that up
at your next plebe rally--

02:21.375 --> 02:24.911
add it to your list of demands.
Allons-y, Neela, vite, vite.

02:25.155 --> 02:27.472
Where do you work?
Connie's Cakes.

02:27.717 --> 02:31.143
Place is like Temptation Island.
Cakes as far as the eye can see.

02:31.176 --> 02:34.000
- My hips could not cope with that.
- You're telling me, sister.

02:34.015 --> 02:36.590
Well, what's the deal with the wedding
cakes? How come they're so expensive?

02:36.608 --> 02:39.100
Saw one that costs $2,000.

02:39.356 --> 02:42.031
Can you really put a price on
the most special day of your life?

02:42.298 --> 02:45.733
- Well, what if it sucks?
- That's what the tasting's for.

02:46.008 --> 02:47.450
Okay, Hope, what's your plan?

02:47.687 --> 02:49.671
Observe for a couple hours,
if no rebound,

02:49.685 --> 02:51.540
home on Benadryl
and a three-day course of pred.

02:51.557 --> 02:54.522
Great. And let's write a scp
for a couple of extra EpiPens,

02:54.537 --> 02:56.351
- just in case.
- Copy that, 23, we'll be ready.

02:56.365 --> 02:58.760
- Need you to sign off on my food allergy.
- Yep.

02:58.805 --> 03:00.060
I need one on my bum-sicle.

03:00.077 --> 03:02.462
Hey, listen up, we got choppers
coming in, two minutes out.

03:02.478 --> 03:05.861
Family crashed in the blizzard.
They were trapped in their car for two days.

03:07.795 --> 03:11.310
Devin Paxon, 40, hip fixed in flexion,
probably dislocated.

03:11.336 --> 03:16.051
- Pulse 86, BP 90/60, sats good.
- EKG, X-rays of pelvis,

03:16.065 --> 03:18.622
right hip, femur, C-spine and chest.

03:18.635 --> 03:22.083
Charlotte, baby, we're okay.
You just be brave.

03:22.097 --> 03:23.763
- Come on, talk to me...
- Everything's okay!

03:23.778 --> 03:27.020
Charlotte, 10. Scalp lac, dehydrated,
hypothermic, but alert.

03:27.037 --> 03:28.410
BP 85 systolic.

03:28.436 --> 03:31.283
Charlotte, we're gonna get you
warmed up and feeling better, okay?

03:31.495 --> 03:34.133
Let's get a Bair Hugger, heated
saline and warm humidified O-2.

03:34.148 --> 03:37.792
- Hey, Dad's definitely more critical.
- Julius Paxon, 45,

03:37.807 --> 03:43.492
hypothermic, bradycardic in the 40s,
BP in the 70s. No sign of major trauma.

03:43.505 --> 03:48.753
All right, EKG monitor, chem panel,
CK, CBC, Foley and a portable chest.

03:48.966 --> 03:50.781
How you doing, Lockhart?
You miss me?

03:50.808 --> 03:53.081
Nope.
Can't say that I did.

03:53.118 --> 03:55.633
I marked your initials
on the back of all the tags.

03:56.328 --> 03:58.080
I can keep track of my own clothes,
you know?

03:58.108 --> 04:00.330
Not you.
I don't know those other kids.

04:01.328 --> 04:05.550
- This is really gonna suck.
- If you keep saying that, it will.

04:05.945 --> 04:10.121
Come on, they got a good soccer team,
an indoor pool-- huh?

04:12.106 --> 04:13.430
Hey.

04:16.065 --> 04:18.303
It's only a couple hours away.

04:18.995 --> 04:20.911
I'm gonna visit every weekend.

04:21.355 --> 04:23.263
Yeah, like that should help.

04:36.876 --> 04:39.650
- Got more saline.
- Good. He's lost his shivering response.

04:39.665 --> 04:42.812
Pupils are sluggish but reactive.
They were out there for two days?!

04:42.925 --> 04:46.061
Trapped in their car after they veered
off the road, skidded into a ditch.

04:46.075 --> 04:48.923
The road they were traveling on,
supposed to be closed for the winter.

04:48.945 --> 04:52.062
- Shawnee National Forest.
- Shawnee?! That's far.

04:52.106 --> 04:53.473
You were the closest open to trauma.

04:53.485 --> 04:56.571
- How we doing over here, Ray?
- I was driving when the blizzard hit.

04:56.748 --> 04:59.913
We were lost.
I couldn't see.

04:59.975 --> 05:03.220
Hip definitely looks dislocated. Other
than that, just cold and a few abrasions.

05:03.236 --> 05:05.952
- Pulse is 90, BP's 95 over 60.
- You have to go and find Spencer.

05:06.498 --> 05:08.690
- Sats are good.
- Four more of morphine.

05:09.265 --> 05:11.700
- Hope, talk to me.
- She's just a little dehydrated.

05:11.715 --> 05:14.532
- BP holding at 85 systolic.
- All right, doesn't look too bad.

05:14.558 --> 05:16.330
- How do we proceed?
- CBC, C-spine,

05:16.346 --> 05:18.672
- chest X-ray and a rectal temp.
- Good. Make that happen.

05:18.725 --> 05:20.561
Hey, your name is Charlotte, right?

05:20.826 --> 05:23.241
I know it seems scary,
but we're gonna fix you up, okay.

05:23.277 --> 05:26.431
- Your mom and your dad, too.
- What about Spencer?

05:26.777 --> 05:28.863
- Who's Spencer?
- Her 14-year-old brother.

05:28.878 --> 05:31.403
- He's still out there.
- What, is he on another chopper?

05:31.417 --> 05:33.410
No, he went to look for help
sometime last night.

05:33.426 --> 05:34.883
That's how we found them.

05:34.925 --> 05:36.930
Kid must have set fires
close to the location.

05:36.965 --> 05:39.591
We followed the smoke to the family,
no sign of the boy.

05:39.767 --> 05:43.183
Please, you have to go
and get Spencer.

05:43.638 --> 05:45.252
Sats are dropping, only 83.

05:45.275 --> 05:49.340
Okay, please tell Mr. Morales
there are things that he can buy

05:49.357 --> 05:51.680
that won't get stuck up there.

05:52.228 --> 05:54.821
You know, with, like, a wide base
or a string attached.

05:54.838 --> 05:57.660
My Spanish definitely ain't that good.

05:58.158 --> 06:00.041
Uh, seÃ±or, huh?

06:00.688 --> 06:05.390
Esta una salida. Huh?
No entrada.

06:06.778 --> 06:09.212
No, okay.
Just get me a translator, please.

06:11.096 --> 06:13.380
Hey, Morris, you still use
that travel agent?

06:13.435 --> 06:15.873
Angie. Yeah, yeah. She's the best.
You gonna go somewhere?

06:15.905 --> 06:17.490
Oh, I just need to get
away from the cold.

06:17.605 --> 06:21.342
I'll get you her number. Hey, Sam, my ankle
guy's still waiting for his posterior splint.

06:21.357 --> 06:22.770
Do I look like a magician?

06:22.857 --> 06:25.351
It'll be done when it's done, Archie.
You'll be the first to know.

06:25.405 --> 06:28.502
Tread lightly, my friend.
She's been barking since she got here.

06:28.556 --> 06:30.473
I can hear you, Frank.
What, do you want some, too?

06:30.598 --> 06:34.850
- Sam. Hey, hey. Everything okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

06:36.727 --> 06:38.121
I, uh...

06:38.678 --> 06:40.552
I'm gonna send Alex away...

06:41.225 --> 06:45.450
to a school for at-risk teens. You know,
for emotional problems and stuff.

06:45.465 --> 06:48.480
- Might be good. He's dealt with a lot.
- Yeah.

06:53.358 --> 06:55.751
I just can't help but feel
like I'm giving up on him.

06:56.025 --> 06:57.952
We both know that's not true.

06:59.025 --> 07:00.873
- Yeah.
- Little help here.

07:01.466 --> 07:04.650
Mario Dunston, 42.
Single GSW to the left chest.

07:04.697 --> 07:06.193
How are you doing, sir?

07:06.375 --> 07:10.180
- Hurts really bad when I breathe.
- Pulse ox 92 on five liters.

07:10.204 --> 07:13.033
Tachy at 120, BP 100 palp,
had four of MS.

07:13.047 --> 07:15.073
- How's the other dude?
- Got another guy right behind us.

07:15.204 --> 07:17.932
Okay, call X-ray for a portable,
and set me up for a chest tube.

07:17.949 --> 07:19.902
Morris, Trauma Two.
Hey, Dawn.

07:20.356 --> 07:23.630
Donnie Moore, 17, GSW, entrance
to the right temple, no exit.

07:23.645 --> 07:25.472
Tubed him for agonal resps.

07:25.805 --> 07:28.421
Donnie? Donnie?

07:28.916 --> 07:32.880
Purposeful hand movement.
Okay, hold CT and an OR.

07:33.206 --> 07:35.060
This guy may have a chance.

07:36.775 --> 07:38.732
- Thanks for lending us your truck, Tony.
- Yeah.

07:38.787 --> 07:41.332
- We'll see you later tonight.
- I shouldn't be too late.

07:42.756 --> 07:44.731
What are you doing?
Let your grandmother sit in front.

07:44.746 --> 07:48.132
It's fine. Makes me feel like
I'm being chauffeured.

07:48.346 --> 07:50.420
All right. Be good.
Don't steal any paintings.

07:50.438 --> 07:52.932
- Don't kill any patients.
- I'm allowed one a day.

07:53.268 --> 07:54.433
One.

07:56.606 --> 07:58.281
Okay, curved Kelly.

07:59.186 --> 08:00.852
Hemocue is 14.2.

08:02.555 --> 08:06.521
- Need to ask you a few questions, Mario.
- I'm a little preoccupied, man.

08:06.855 --> 08:08.751
What kind of beef you got
with your Two-Niner buddy?

08:08.776 --> 08:12.110
What you sweating me for?
I ain't do nothing but get shot.

08:12.135 --> 08:14.382
Y'all need to get out there and arrest somebody.

08:14.405 --> 08:17.430
- You got anybody in mind?
- How should I know? Y'all the cops.

08:17.457 --> 08:20.500
All right, guys, come on, let us work.
He's not going anywhere.

08:21.166 --> 08:22.271
Thanks.

08:22.386 --> 08:26.363
- That was for me, not you.
- 32 French on a vascular clamp.

08:27.596 --> 08:30.433
- How many times you been shot?
- This makes eight.

08:31.666 --> 08:33.400
O silk on a driver.

08:33.977 --> 08:35.942
Only 200 cc's out.

08:35.955 --> 08:39.321
Looks like you didn't bag a main vein.
You're one lucky guy.

08:39.568 --> 08:42.592
Yeah, I'm what they call black Irish.

08:44.034 --> 08:45.480
He's having a lot of ectopy.

08:45.508 --> 08:48.603
- QRS is wide. What's his temp?
- Down 84.

08:48.635 --> 08:51.353
- What's happening?
- He's vasodilating,

08:51.366 --> 08:55.573
which means the colder blood from his
extremities is lowering his core temp.

08:55.657 --> 08:58.692
- Charlotte, honey?
- I'm okay, Mom.

08:59.377 --> 09:01.140
That's my good girl.

09:02.078 --> 09:04.422
Don't worry, they're gonna
find your brother.

09:04.678 --> 09:07.510
- We're all gonna be okay.
- I can't get this hip back in place.

09:07.546 --> 09:09.491
- All right, let me try.
- Wait, hold on.

09:09.508 --> 09:10.870
Hold on, hold on.

09:12.997 --> 09:14.570
- All right, I got it.
- He's in V-fib.

09:14.606 --> 09:17.333
- All right, start CPR.
- Charge to 200.

09:18.528 --> 09:19.821
Charging.

09:20.957 --> 09:22.173
Clear.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.350
- No change.
- What are they doing?

09:25.376 --> 09:27.400
Your mom's asleep,
so they could fix her hip.

09:27.417 --> 09:29.862
And right now, they're trying
to help your dad's heart.

09:31.746 --> 09:34.642
- Still V-fib. Charge to 300.
- Dad?!

09:34.925 --> 09:36.691
All right, Hope, let's move her
out into the hallway.

09:36.707 --> 09:38.781
Come on, Charlotte.
We got to let them work.

09:38.807 --> 09:40.310
No, I want to stay.

09:40.568 --> 09:42.440
- Dad!
- Clear.

09:43.537 --> 09:47.581
- No change. One milligram epi.
- He can't stay in V-fib for much longer.

09:48.386 --> 09:49.940
Clear.

09:52.945 --> 09:55.991
Mario Dunston.
Street name's Monster.

09:56.248 --> 09:58.291
Got out of Stateville a few weeks ago.

09:58.507 --> 10:01.503
- He's a real O.G., huh?
- Did 20 years.

10:01.688 --> 10:04.310
Gang-related shooting,
he left a kid paralyzed.

10:04.915 --> 10:08.180
Well, if he remains stable,
you guys can talk to him soon.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.490
- How's he doing?
- Still 250 cc's out.

10:11.675 --> 10:15.292
You collapsed a lung, minor bleeding.
Should take about three days to heal.

10:15.756 --> 10:17.951
The cops need to ask you some questions.

10:18.495 --> 10:21.213
What for?
I got an IS ?

10:21.277 --> 10:24.601
You just did 20 years.
You cooperate, maybe they'll be lenient.

10:24.638 --> 10:27.732
Lenient?
What they need to be lenient for?

10:27.758 --> 10:30.401
- I didn't do nothing.
- Well, then tell them who did it.

10:32.235 --> 10:35.471
- I ain't see who did it.
- Oh, you were just an innocent bystander?

10:35.505 --> 10:37.890
Yeah, okay, Monster.
Suit yourself.

10:37.905 --> 10:41.190
Name's Mario.
Or Mr. Dunston.

10:41.365 --> 10:43.690
- Witch ever you prefer.
- Morris!

10:44.515 --> 10:45.991
What's up?

10:47.738 --> 10:49.441
You need anything?

10:49.908 --> 10:51.892
Nah, I'm straight.

10:53.326 --> 10:54.973
Is he gonna be all right?

10:55.665 --> 10:57.053
I don't know.

10:57.086 --> 10:59.490
Sam! Could you give us
a hand in here, please?

11:20.228 --> 11:21.492
Junior?

11:30.677 --> 11:31.741
Junior!

11:32.607 --> 11:33.380
Hey!

11:34.075 --> 11:35.333
- Junior!
- Hey, lay down!

11:35.378 --> 11:37.341
You're going to pull
your chest tube out!

11:37.665 --> 11:40.490
Sam, call security!
What the hell are you doing, man?!

11:41.348 --> 11:42.830
Come on!
Get security now!

11:42.857 --> 11:47.422
You don't need no security.
That's my son! Junior! Junior!

11:47.767 --> 11:50.302
That's my son.
Junior!

11:54.235 --> 11:55.470
Is he all right?

11:55.577 --> 11:58.422
They found him unconscious
at the bottom of some stairs,

11:58.457 --> 12:01.601
- not far from where they found you.
- Is he all right?

12:01.788 --> 12:05.773
We won't know for sure until he's had a CT.
He took a pretty hard blow to the head.

12:06.577 --> 12:08.882
And you still have absolutely
no idea what happened?

12:09.657 --> 12:11.831
- Damn it!
- V-fib again.

12:12.005 --> 12:13.392
Anything I can do?

12:13.477 --> 12:15.491
- Charge to 360.
- Come on, Donnie.

12:15.767 --> 12:16.880
Charged.

12:17.177 --> 12:18.900
Blew a pupil.
Clear!

12:20.986 --> 12:22.273
Clear. Another amp of epi.

12:22.288 --> 12:24.542
Dr. Gates, why is this patient
in brain stem failure?

12:24.556 --> 12:28.222
Multiple hematomas push the uncus
across the free edge of the tentorium,

12:28.247 --> 12:32.050
compressing the brain stem, knocking
out his vegetative functions.

12:33.356 --> 12:35.372
- This guy's a goner.
- Clear!

12:36.557 --> 12:38.823
Okay, another round.
Charge at 360.

12:40.907 --> 12:42.282
Clear!

12:45.447 --> 12:47.073
Okay, that's it.

12:47.756 --> 12:51.612
Clear the room and have Social
Work try to contact the family.

12:51.635 --> 12:55.992
- Gates, call it.
- Time of death, 11:12 a.m.

13:09.445 --> 13:10.601
How does it feel?

13:10.866 --> 13:13.281
- Throbby.
- That will go away.

13:13.536 --> 13:17.163
Can I get you anything?
Hot chocolat or some Jell-O?

13:17.488 --> 13:19.462
Is my dad gonna die?

13:21.135 --> 13:23.900
You know, there's some great doctors

13:23.938 --> 13:27.280
working very hard right now
to make sure that doesn't happen.

13:27.878 --> 13:31.791
You just need to try
and think positive thoughts.

13:32.058 --> 13:34.443
You are a tough little girl.
I can tell.

13:34.458 --> 13:36.962
Film looks good, Mrs. Paxon.
Your hip is back in place.

13:37.008 --> 13:40.511
Thanks, it feels much better.
Hi, baby. You okay?

13:40.526 --> 13:41.513
She's good.

13:41.537 --> 13:44.891
Mrs. Paxon, we're going to need your consent
for a procedure on your husband.

13:45.276 --> 13:47.510
- What kind of procedure?
- There's a problem with his heart.

13:47.648 --> 13:51.350
Oh, my God.
Charlie, baby, Mommy will be right back.

13:51.767 --> 13:54.263
Mrs. Paxon, your husband's heart
has stopped from being too cold.

13:54.278 --> 13:56.630
We need to perform
what's called a thoracotomy.

13:56.725 --> 13:57.731
What is that?

13:57.776 --> 13:59.950
It's a procedure where
we cut open his chest

13:59.978 --> 14:02.383
and then we're going to pour warm
water directly onto his heart.

14:02.405 --> 14:05.382
That sounds dangerous.
Is there another way?

14:05.497 --> 14:08.243
It's not a standard procedure, but it's
the fastest way to get his temperature up.

14:08.278 --> 14:11.690
- That's why we need your consent.
- I don't know. I-I...

14:12.456 --> 14:14.142
Maybe we could wait until he wakes up

14:14.178 --> 14:15.693
- and then we can ask.
- Right now, the risk of dying

14:15.706 --> 14:18.312
from hypothermia could probably be
greater than the risk of this procedure.

14:18.356 --> 14:20.690
- I, I, I can't do this.
- Mrs. Paxon...

14:21.115 --> 14:23.290
...we cannot do this
without your permission.

14:23.406 --> 14:26.120
What would your husband want?
Is he a fighter?

14:26.596 --> 14:29.931
- Yes. Yes, he is.
- Then sign the consent.

14:30.787 --> 14:31.783
- Hey.
- Hey there.

14:31.798 --> 14:34.063
- I haven't seen you.
- Yeah, I've been buried.

14:34.258 --> 14:37.081
Yeah, me too. I'm knackered.
Lunch later?

14:37.136 --> 14:39.782
Kovac has me on scut patrol
and this board is chock-full.

14:39.806 --> 14:42.082
- Maybe after your shift?
- Yeah, I'll drive you home.

14:42.585 --> 14:46.302
- Hey, Neela, they need you in Trauma One.
- I'm on my way. I'll see you later.

14:46.328 --> 14:49.662
Hey, uh, Angie's number. I gave her
the heads up, she's expecting your call.

14:49.678 --> 14:50.423
Thanks, Archie.

14:50.436 --> 14:52.860
Said she has some great
family resort hook-ups.

14:52.877 --> 14:56.040
Fun for the gremlin, swimming
with dolphins, water slides.

14:56.077 --> 14:59.080
We might not be bringing Gremlin.

14:59.398 --> 15:03.481
Oh, a little kick start to
the old post-partum love life.

15:03.506 --> 15:05.202
I feel you, big guy. All right.

15:05.277 --> 15:08.461
Hey, Frank, I'm going to get
my caffeine on if anybody's looking.

15:08.476 --> 15:12.133
Hey, is uh...
Dr. Kovac going on vacation?

15:12.145 --> 15:14.522
Yeah-- little romantic getaway, I guess.

15:14.996 --> 15:16.740
They're getting married;
I just know it.

15:16.756 --> 15:18.850
Abby was asking a patient
about wedding cakes this morning,

15:18.875 --> 15:20.813
and that little getaway
smacks of honeymoon.

15:20.835 --> 15:23.703
Oh, have you met Abby Lockhart?
Not exactly the marrying kind.

15:23.728 --> 15:26.271
We're female--
we're all the marrying kind.

15:26.368 --> 15:30.870
I can smell a wedding a mile away,
Archie. It's like a sixth sense.

15:31.228 --> 15:33.181
- Still in v-fib. No pulse.
- Rib spreader.

15:33.268 --> 15:35.551
All right.
Hold ventilation for a minute.

15:37.648 --> 15:39.643
Okay, now...

15:39.976 --> 15:43.093
as the lung deflates,
try to feel for the heart.

15:45.536 --> 15:47.241
- Okay, I feel it. No effusion.
- All right, good--

15:47.256 --> 15:49.503
now you can start
internal compressions.

15:50.207 --> 15:52.003
Got the first 10 liters.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.442
Hey, Pratt.

15:58.086 --> 16:00.843
- Hey, Charlotte, how'd you get in here?
- The door.

16:00.857 --> 16:03.050
- We ready for the saline?
- Yeah, go ahead. Uh,

16:03.067 --> 16:05.282
pour in the first liter
and get suction ready.

16:05.315 --> 16:07.952
Come on, turn around.
You shouldn't see this.

16:08.657 --> 16:10.611
Okay, the first liter is going in.

16:11.918 --> 16:13.461
What are they doing to my dad?

16:13.476 --> 16:17.090
Pouring warm water on his heart
to help him fight off the cold.

16:18.028 --> 16:20.110
This is all my mom's fault.

16:20.777 --> 16:23.192
You were in an accident, Charlie.
It's nobody's fault.

16:23.988 --> 16:26.500
She was driving and they were fighting.

16:26.625 --> 16:29.650
- Families fight. It doesn't mean that...
- It's because she cheated.

16:31.496 --> 16:33.463
That's why they're getting a divorce.

16:33.855 --> 16:37.103
Oh, thank goodness. Sorry--
I came back out and she was gone.

16:37.138 --> 16:39.240
Come on, sweetie,
your mom's asking for you.

16:39.455 --> 16:41.312
I want to stay with my dad.

16:43.407 --> 16:46.070
All right. Tell her mom she'll be fine.
It's okay.

16:46.108 --> 16:47.142
I'm here. Where do you need me?

16:47.155 --> 16:49.851
Start internal compressions.
Sterile sixes to Neela.

16:50.075 --> 16:53.172
- What are you expecting a call?
- Spencer.

16:53.476 --> 16:57.212
I keep texting him,
but he hasn't written back yet.

16:59.396 --> 17:00.413
Charge!

17:01.248 --> 17:03.841
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a rhythm and a pulse.

17:03.878 --> 17:05.393
Is this the father of the family
that got rescued?

17:05.406 --> 17:08.992
Yeah, tried for 48 hours after an MVA.
Hypothermic to 84 degrees;

17:09.007 --> 17:12.961
- v-fib arrest; refractory to shocks.
- Why is his chest open?

17:12.974 --> 17:16.333
Bypass wasn't available, so we did
a thoracotomy for a rapid re-warming.

17:16.356 --> 17:18.590
- Was that really necessary?
- Well, we've got a rhythm back.

17:18.607 --> 17:21.069
Okay, we'll close him up.
Suction fluids from the chest.

17:21.105 --> 17:23.413
Cover the incisions,
so we can take him to the OR.

17:23.436 --> 17:25.473
- Don't you want me to scrub in?
- No, it won't be necessary.

17:25.508 --> 17:26.981
This is a good teaching
case for Mae Lee.

17:27.005 --> 17:28.753
Stay down and finish your consult.

17:29.745 --> 17:30.881
What's going on?

17:31.258 --> 17:33.933
Oh, he wanted to talk to his son,
so I was giving him a few minutes.

17:34.126 --> 17:36.561
Dr. Morris, the police want to know
if they can talk to the boy.

17:36.578 --> 17:38.462
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.

17:39.937 --> 17:41.411
Hey, hey, man, what you doing?
We ain't finished yet.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.483
- Police need to talk to your son.
- What for?

17:43.605 --> 17:45.801
They found him at the scene.
They think he might be involved.

17:45.877 --> 17:48.350
Hey, don't say nothin', Junior.
Everything's gonna be all right.

17:48.367 --> 17:50.730
Damn, man!
Stop calling me that, man!

17:50.777 --> 17:55.871
We still gotta wait for the CT but, so
far, it looks like just a mild concussion.

17:55.997 --> 17:58.170
My guess is he's fine.

18:02.398 --> 18:04.792
So, did he tell you what happened today?

18:05.746 --> 18:08.381
- Fell down some stairs.
- He fell.

18:09.197 --> 18:11.233
- That's it.
- That's it.

18:11.715 --> 18:13.872
You're only making this harder
on yourself, you know.

18:13.896 --> 18:17.330
- Give it up, Junior. Come on.
- I told you I don't know nothing!

18:17.345 --> 18:20.932
88th Street Bishop on Two-Niner turf--
what were you doing over there, man?

18:21.056 --> 18:24.292
- We know you had beef with Donnie.
- Hey, where they taking him?

18:24.377 --> 18:26.350
- Up to that CT I told you about.
- Got one of Donnie's homeboys

18:26.368 --> 18:28.820
- saying you two had words this morning.
- So?

18:29.098 --> 18:31.853
Heard you guys got
pretty hot, got into it.

18:32.107 --> 18:35.132
- Why don't they just leave him alone?
- Hey, hey, lay down, okay?

18:35.145 --> 18:36.900
Come on, you don't want to pull
that chest tube out-- trust me.

18:36.916 --> 18:39.053
Hey, yo, cop! Hey!

18:39.578 --> 18:40.841
I'm in here!

18:41.877 --> 18:43.243
What do you want?

18:44.807 --> 18:47.780
- Y'all want a statement?
- Oh, now you're ready to talk.

18:48.715 --> 18:53.050
Yeah, I shot that punk.
Nine milli.

18:53.955 --> 18:58.420
Would've capped his ass again too,
but he got me before I could.

19:00.506 --> 19:01.871
You shot him.

19:02.945 --> 19:04.201
Yeah, that's right.

19:04.636 --> 19:06.030
What, I stutter?

19:07.418 --> 19:11.431
So why don't y'all go on ahead and ask me
your little questions for your little report.

19:12.085 --> 19:13.613
What you wanna know?

19:17.178 --> 19:19.143
...so have search

19:19.156 --> 19:21.683
and rescue contact us at County if
there's any information.

19:21.706 --> 19:24.232
Dr. Lockhart--
L-O-C-K-H-A-R-T.

19:24.355 --> 19:28.052
- Didn't find Spencer yet, huh?
- Hey, guys, I made a latte run.

19:28.107 --> 19:30.501
I remembered how much you like
extra cinnamon, Abby.

19:30.516 --> 19:32.390
- I'm gonna put them in the Break Room.
- Thank you, Hope.

19:32.405 --> 19:35.053
- Pratt, you got a minute?
- Yeah. Come on, walk with me.

19:35.105 --> 19:37.392
Hey, Pratt, I gotta sign out.
I have a family emergency.

19:37.416 --> 19:38.631
- Wait-- what?
- It's really important--

19:38.646 --> 19:40.202
I'll be back in the morning.

19:40.908 --> 19:42.211
You know, there's always
something with that guy.

19:42.225 --> 19:45.320
Hey, so check this out:
I got this OG with a GSW.

19:45.335 --> 19:47.690
Just confessed to shooting
some kid from a rival gang.

19:47.708 --> 19:50.291
But it doesn't add up.
I don't think he did it.

19:50.316 --> 19:53.623
Okay, first he says he had nothing
to do with it. Then he confesses.

19:53.726 --> 19:57.391
I mean, if he did it, why would he confess?
And if he didn't do it, why would he confess?

19:57.455 --> 19:59.120
How would I know?
Did you ask him?

19:59.137 --> 20:00.880
Well, I thought maybe
you could talk to him.

20:01.135 --> 20:03.520
- Did you ask Kovac?
- Why would I do that?

20:03.658 --> 20:07.570
Uh, let me think. Uh... chief of the ER,
great with people, years of experience.

20:07.587 --> 20:10.260
Yeah, but, you know, this is kind of
more in your wheelhouse.

20:10.278 --> 20:14.043
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
And exactly what wheelhouse is that?

20:15.776 --> 20:18.213
You want me to talk to this dude
because I'm black.

20:18.416 --> 20:21.110
Well, yeah.
I mean, you are black, aren't you?

20:21.156 --> 20:23.873
- That's wrong, Morris.
- What?! We do this all the time.

20:23.975 --> 20:26.253
If I had a pregnant girl,
I might get Abby.

20:26.277 --> 20:27.720
Big Croatian-- Kovac.

20:27.748 --> 20:29.352
I didn't come to you
with my autistic Irish kid.

20:29.377 --> 20:32.092
You could've. You should've.
Hey, what is the big deal?

20:32.106 --> 20:37.082
- You know that I love the black man.
- You don't want to get into this with me.

20:37.208 --> 20:39.523
Look, I got a black guy
from the inner city

20:39.536 --> 20:41.421
confessing to a crime
that I don't think he committed.

20:41.436 --> 20:44.370
Okay, last time I checked, you were
a black guy from the inner city.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.782
Forgive me if I thought
you could relate on a level I can't.

20:46.988 --> 20:49.341
So you think that just because
we both grew up black and poor,

20:49.358 --> 20:53.993
- we somehow magically relate.
- Well, there's nothing magical about it.

20:54.405 --> 20:55.750
Black isn't just one thing, Morris.

20:55.775 --> 20:58.402
We don't all share some sort
of collective consciousness.

20:58.616 --> 21:01.892
I know you may think we all look alike,
but we're not.

21:07.576 --> 21:09.141
- Thanks for making a coffee run.
- Yeah, no problem.

21:09.155 --> 21:10.763
There's sugar there, too.

21:11.166 --> 21:15.761
Oh! Where is my darn stethoscope?
It's the third one I've lost.

21:23.478 --> 21:24.511
- I knew it!
- What?

21:24.536 --> 21:25.782
- You're getting married.
- Am not.

21:25.807 --> 21:27.231
Well, why are you looking at
the wedding mags?

21:27.247 --> 21:28.880
Because they're-- they're there.

21:28.906 --> 21:31.303
And why were you asking all
the wedding cake questions earlier?

21:31.317 --> 21:35.001
- I was... I was curious.
- Okay. Fine.

21:35.217 --> 21:37.293
Look me in the eye and tell me
you're not getting married.

21:37.305 --> 21:38.450
- No.
- Why not?

21:38.467 --> 21:40.740
'Cause that's stupid. I...

21:45.347 --> 21:47.050
- I am not getting married.
- You looked away!

21:47.078 --> 21:49.153
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it!
Oh, God...

21:49.377 --> 21:51.483
- This one would look so pretty on you.
- Okay, listen, Hope,

21:51.505 --> 21:53.463
- Luka asked if we could just keep this quiet.
- It's in your eyes.

21:53.478 --> 21:56.492
You have the glow. I can't wait for the glow.
I can't wait to try on wedding dresses...

21:56.578 --> 21:58.021
Hope!

21:59.465 --> 22:01.400
If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.

22:03.355 --> 22:04.660
Do you hear me?

22:05.316 --> 22:07.250
Kill you. As in dead.

22:07.916 --> 22:09.243
Got it?

22:15.275 --> 22:18.382
- What's up, bruh?
- Mr. Dunston, I'm Dr. Pratt.

22:18.407 --> 22:20.722
I'm gonna go get his next dose of Ancef.

22:22.416 --> 22:24.301
Looks like your bleeding has slowed down.

22:24.338 --> 22:26.762
Your lung should heal in a few days
with the chest tube.

22:27.165 --> 22:29.591
Yeah, that's what the other dude told me.

22:30.026 --> 22:31.553
Y'all changing shifts?

22:33.607 --> 22:36.240
No, no.
Not exactly.

22:37.157 --> 22:39.760
Just thought maybe you'd want to talk to somebody.

22:41.757 --> 22:45.493
- What, you like a shrink?
- No. I'm not a shrink.

22:46.875 --> 22:50.940
But for some reason, Dr. Morris thinks you
didn't commit the crime you confessed to.

22:53.426 --> 22:54.471
Oh!

22:55.296 --> 22:58.693
So this like a black thing.
Hey, excuse me, nurse.

22:58.705 --> 23:02.241
I'm sorry, you might want to step out.
We about to have black man talk.

23:02.258 --> 23:04.602
- Ain't that right, Doc?
- Hey, man, I'm trying to help you.

23:04.806 --> 23:06.701
Hey, go ahead, break it down.

23:06.877 --> 23:09.803
Why don't you tell me what kind
of help you think I need, Doc.

23:10.515 --> 23:11.810
You know what? Forget it.

23:11.838 --> 23:14.001
That's right, we ain't got
nothing to talk about.

23:14.017 --> 23:16.211
- You don't know me, fool.
- No, I don't know you;

23:16.617 --> 23:19.800
I know I work on a parade of dudes
just like you every day.

23:20.905 --> 23:25.450
Where you from, Dr. Pratt? Huh?
You one of them North Shore brothers?

23:27.795 --> 23:30.180
Nah. I'm from right here.

23:30.515 --> 23:32.362
55th and Michigan.

23:34.118 --> 23:37.283
So you think 'cause you got
your little doctor degree,

23:37.488 --> 23:39.790
you got out the ghetto,
you can come back and judge me?

23:39.807 --> 23:42.042
Nobody's judging you.
The mistakes you made are all yours.

23:42.175 --> 23:47.341
That's right. And 20 years I spent
paying. I did my time, brother.

23:49.108 --> 23:52.410
Strip searches, nasty-ass food,
piss when they tell you,

23:52.438 --> 23:55.302
take a dump when they tell you.
It's like you didn't even exist.

23:55.327 --> 23:56.720
Everything--

23:58.006 --> 24:01.200
your family, your friends,
your whole life just disappears.

24:01.296 --> 24:05.072
- And you still didn't learn a damn thing.
- Hey, man, look here, I learned.

24:05.087 --> 24:08.431
- Yeah, but you're still banging, right?
- I ain't say that.

24:09.037 --> 24:10.431
But, yeah.

24:11.786 --> 24:15.620
Yeah, I used to bang. Back in the day,
boy, couldn't tell me nothing.

24:18.935 --> 24:20.971
But then my son came.

24:23.186 --> 24:26.353
I gave all that up, man, years ago.

24:27.998 --> 24:29.181
Now I'm just...

24:30.455 --> 24:32.593
I just get through the day...

24:33.515 --> 24:35.441
trying to raise my boy right...

24:36.426 --> 24:38.491
make up for lost time, you know.

24:41.177 --> 24:43.303
Then how come your boy is concussed,

24:43.517 --> 24:46.653
the other kid is dead, and you're sitting
here with a bullet in your chest?

24:48.975 --> 24:51.201
Mario?
Hey, Mario! Hey!

24:53.106 --> 24:56.262
- When was his last morphine?
- Four migs, about an hour ago.

24:57.336 --> 24:59.153
All right, we got muffled heart sounds.

24:59.175 --> 25:01.840
- Pressure's down, 80/60.
- All right, give me the sonosite.

25:01.856 --> 25:04.983
- Is there more blood in the thoraseal?
- No. Not a drop.

25:10.636 --> 25:13.063
Squeeze in a liter of saline.

25:15.587 --> 25:17.750
Mario! Mario!

25:19.008 --> 25:20.011
Keith.

25:20.195 --> 25:22.592
- Hey, Ton', how you been?
- I'm all right. Where is he?

25:23.237 --> 25:24.262
He's over there.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.541
You know I wouldn't have
called you unless it was bad.

25:26.678 --> 25:29.471
He started up with one of my customers.
He almost got himself killed.

25:29.526 --> 25:30.692
How much does he owe?

25:30.707 --> 25:32.841
Tony, your pop, he's on a bender, you know.

25:33.026 --> 25:34.761
Most of the time, it's just the weekends, but...

25:34.777 --> 25:36.403
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got it.

25:44.208 --> 25:45.380
Mike.

25:48.248 --> 25:50.190
What the hell are you doing here?

25:51.367 --> 25:54.542
Shouldn't you be off playing doctor with somebody's wife somewhere?

25:54.557 --> 25:56.632
- That's enough. Let's go.
- Get your hands off me!

25:56.677 --> 25:59.032
That's enough, you're done!
Let's go!

26:02.106 --> 26:05.031
Little Tony.

26:11.258 --> 26:13.831
Can't drain with a catheter.
We'll never get it all out.

26:14.185 --> 26:16.383
- This the tamponade?
- He's a perfect candidate for

26:16.407 --> 26:18.570
- a subxiphoid pericardial window.
- She's right.

26:18.658 --> 26:20.480
Prep from nipples to umbilicus.

26:20.625 --> 26:23.801
- Pressure's only 80 after two units.
- He needs to be decompressed now.

26:23.915 --> 26:28.030
Masks and sterile gloves for me
and Mae Lee, 30 cc's of one percent lido.

26:28.767 --> 26:31.100
You ever seen
a subxiphoid pericardiostomy?

26:31.138 --> 26:33.350
- I've read about them.
- Dr. Dubenko, I can...

26:33.378 --> 26:35.332
It's a little crowded in here,
Neela-- could you run down

26:35.356 --> 26:37.843
and tell the Paxon family
dad's chest closure went really well.

26:37.857 --> 26:40.463
They can see him in Recovery.
Two of versed.

26:40.566 --> 26:43.510
- Take the edge off.
- What are y'all doing to me?

26:43.538 --> 26:46.680
Uh, we need to drain some blood
caught in the sac around your heart

26:46.708 --> 26:48.300
keeping it from beating normally.

26:48.317 --> 26:51.613
The CT on the Dunston boy was clear--
no fractures, no bleeding.

26:51.845 --> 26:54.653
- Is that Junior?
- Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

26:57.748 --> 26:58.812
H... Hey.

26:59.837 --> 27:02.031
Take a look at him, make sure.

27:02.798 --> 27:05.593
- Versed's going in.
- Here you go, Morris.

27:13.305 --> 27:15.221
Hey, man, when y'all
gonna let me out of here?

27:15.635 --> 27:18.452
Oh, my bad.
You got someplace to be?

27:18.755 --> 27:21.121
Man, don't worry where I got to be.
Just do your little chart,

27:21.138 --> 27:23.640
- and let me up out of here.
- What, you got a job to go to?

27:23.678 --> 27:25.393
You going to school or something?

27:28.538 --> 27:32.350
Look, you got a mild concussion.
Gonna get out of here today.

27:32.866 --> 27:35.492
It's too bad I can't say
the same thing about your pops.

27:35.705 --> 27:37.490
Man, he ain't my pops.

27:38.256 --> 27:41.120
Only time I ever seen
that fool was on visiting day.

27:42.025 --> 27:44.630
Yeah, well, looks like you're
gonna be visiting him again.

27:45.808 --> 27:47.363
What, you didn't know?

27:47.615 --> 27:50.001
Yeah, man, he's going back in
for shooting that Two-Niner.

27:50.028 --> 27:52.843
Hey, Dawn, what was his name again?
Like, Donnie, right?

27:52.856 --> 27:54.182
- Mm-hmm, Donnie Moore.
- Right.

27:54.607 --> 27:58.562
Let me tell you something, Junior,
your pops, he ain't no joke.

27:58.906 --> 28:01.040
He told five-oh everything.

28:01.678 --> 28:04.262
Man, he must really want
all the credit for this.

28:04.668 --> 28:07.372
Come on, man, you don't
have to front for me.

28:07.477 --> 28:10.101
I mean, tell the truth,
it's got to be kind of cool, right?

28:10.137 --> 28:11.963
To have a pops like that
with that kind of rep.

28:12.007 --> 28:15.450
I mean, look at him, the man's been
shot eight times and he's still here.

28:15.905 --> 28:18.713
Yeah, that's one bad dude
right there, Junior.

28:18.735 --> 28:21.211
Look, man, don't call me that, man!

28:21.588 --> 28:23.493
Look, he ain't even do nothing!

28:24.078 --> 28:25.603
I shot that fool!

28:25.626 --> 28:27.072
- Yeah, right.
- It was me!

28:27.107 --> 28:28.461
Yeah, okay.

28:29.247 --> 28:32.903
All right. Look, yo, five-oh!
Yo, get your ass in here, man!

28:33.125 --> 28:35.781
Look, he ain't do nothing!
He ain't got nothing to do with this.

28:35.807 --> 28:38.362
I shot that fool.
Then this mother...

28:38.377 --> 28:40.431
He tried to stop me,
so I shot his ass, too.

28:40.457 --> 28:43.622
And I threw my nine down the garbage
chute. Y'all look, y'all find it, all right?

28:43.636 --> 28:46.471
Look, man, you ain't my father, man!
Look, stay out my life, all right?!

28:46.556 --> 28:47.993
You ain't my father!
You a bitch!

28:48.008 --> 28:50.682
- The hell you think you're doing?!
- Get off me, man! You a bitch, man!

28:50.705 --> 28:52.042
- Come on, let's go.
- No! Get off me!

28:52.058 --> 28:54.723
Get your hands behind your back!
Put him down, put him down.

29:00.476 --> 29:03.232
Grab you a hot chocolate,
then go up and see your dad?

29:03.517 --> 29:06.711
- You sure you don't want anything?
- Oh, no, thanks. I'm fine.

29:07.205 --> 29:09.691
- Why is she so sleepy?
- Oh, no, it's just the medicine, sweetie.

29:09.707 --> 29:13.012
- Pulse 48, BP 75 systolic.
- Spencer!

29:13.058 --> 29:15.383
- He's unresponsive.
- Oh, my gosh, how did you find him?!

29:15.405 --> 29:17.813
Damndest thing--
they triangulated his cell phone

29:17.838 --> 29:19.770
from text messages
someone was sending him.

29:19.786 --> 29:22.683
- Spencer, it's okay. It's gonna be okay.
- I'll go get Dr. Kovac.

29:22.708 --> 29:27.032
CBC, chem panel, EKG, CK, warm saline,
a Bair Hugger and a portable chest.

29:27.075 --> 29:29.530
Honey, stay out there
while we work, okay?

29:41.167 --> 29:42.471
Hey, I got to go wake up the mom.

29:42.487 --> 29:45.200
Yeah, Dr. Pratt gave her five of versed.
You might want to try Flumazenil.

29:45.218 --> 29:46.513
You got it.

29:49.588 --> 29:52.270
Are they gonna cut open Spencer
like they did my dad?

29:52.507 --> 29:54.223
No, only if they have to.

29:55.425 --> 29:57.430
I hope they don't have to.

30:03.866 --> 30:08.250
Only 400 cc's of mediastinal output.
BP is 124/82.

30:08.278 --> 30:10.452
- Everything's back to normal.
- How about his crit?

30:10.555 --> 30:13.761
Holding steady at 40.
This guy's as tough as nails.

30:15.006 --> 30:18.890
- Hey, about earlier...
- Ah, no, no, no. Don't sweat it.

30:19.406 --> 30:22.130
I just want you to know
you can come to me for help anytime.

30:23.588 --> 30:25.443
- Likewise.
- All right.

30:26.478 --> 30:27.500
All right.

30:29.066 --> 30:30.102
Hey.

30:30.817 --> 30:34.342
Yeah, uh... not supposed
to hang on that long, Morris.

30:34.356 --> 30:35.531
Oh, okay, yeah.

30:35.547 --> 30:37.501
- Or that tight.
- Oh, yeah. Sorry.

30:38.287 --> 30:40.280
- Peace out, man.
- All right.

30:47.336 --> 30:49.053
So it looks like you're good.

30:49.385 --> 30:52.071
No more bleeding in your chest,
nothing around your heart.

30:52.858 --> 30:54.882
Those tubes, they stay in a few days.

30:55.255 --> 30:58.250
- Could I get something to drink?
- Uh, yeah. Water okay?

31:00.498 --> 31:04.880
Just wanted to apologize about
how things went down today.

31:04.907 --> 31:07.991
Don't even trip.
I should be thanking you.

31:08.416 --> 31:10.352
Saved my life, man.

31:12.528 --> 31:14.170
I meant your son.

31:15.345 --> 31:18.341
I mean, you bust your ass trying
to protect the ones you love,

31:18.547 --> 31:22.022
- try to keep them from making mistakes...
- Yeah, and they make them anyway.

31:22.816 --> 31:25.123
Kept telling him to forget it.

31:25.898 --> 31:30.172
Shot that Donnie kid over nothing.
'Cause he looked at him the wrong way.

31:31.457 --> 31:32.941
Kids, man.

31:33.296 --> 31:35.502
Guess you try to hold on
to them as long as you can.

31:35.526 --> 31:38.873
Then one day, got to let go.

31:40.116 --> 31:42.213
And maybe someday they'll come back.

31:43.207 --> 31:44.942
Yeah, maybe.

31:47.526 --> 31:50.931
- Hey, good luck to you, man.
- Thanks, Doc.

31:51.988 --> 31:54.531
Hopefully, I never see your ass again.

31:59.498 --> 32:02.941
- Hey. They found Spencer Paxon.
- Get out of here. How is he?

32:02.958 --> 32:04.033
Not great.

32:04.237 --> 32:07.270
- Well, do they need some help in there?
- Uh, Kovac and Abby are in there.

32:07.498 --> 32:09.742
- You have a good night.
- All right.

32:13.147 --> 32:16.082
- Asshole slumlord.
- You got one week, Mike-- one.

32:16.186 --> 32:18.471
Should've been paying me to live in that dump.

32:18.497 --> 32:20.963
Then you're on your own.
You can stay in my room.

32:22.048 --> 32:24.920
Listen, Ton', I want you to know,
I really appreciate it, Ton'.

32:24.935 --> 32:29.412
I mean, I really do.
You won't even know I'm there.

32:36.697 --> 32:37.943
Hello.

32:38.628 --> 32:40.672
- You're home early.
- Yeah.

32:41.548 --> 32:44.211
Everyone, this is Mike.
Mike, everyone.

32:45.717 --> 32:49.881
- It's a pleasure.
- These are the Rileys, Meg's parents.

32:51.728 --> 32:54.783
Oh. I'm sorry about your girl.

32:55.355 --> 32:57.543
It's a damn shame.

33:02.438 --> 33:03.973
Where's the head?

33:04.618 --> 33:06.343
Over there.

33:12.576 --> 33:16.300
- Who is that guy?
- That was, uh, my father.

33:16.355 --> 33:19.571
He wasn't feeling so well,
so I thought I'd help him out.

33:19.585 --> 33:21.571
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he's fine.

33:21.808 --> 33:25.883
- So, how many paintings did you steal?
- Just one. A lovely Degas.

33:26.005 --> 33:28.480
Yeah, it's a poster. We're gonna get
it framed for my bedroom.

33:28.505 --> 33:30.073
That sounds terrific.

33:30.436 --> 33:32.982
- Tony, a minute?
- Sure.

33:35.417 --> 33:37.502
Everything okay?
She behave herself?

33:37.518 --> 33:41.341
Yeah, you bet. Had a great day.
She seems to be handling it well.

33:41.375 --> 33:46.050
Well, she has good days and bad days.
You know, she's a fighter like Meg.

33:48.385 --> 33:51.543
We don't want to disrupt her school year;
we know she's been through a lot.

33:51.555 --> 33:55.642
But we should start working out
the details for the move.

33:55.988 --> 34:01.963
- She'll adjust quickly, she's young.
- Yeah, well, family's best.

34:01.976 --> 34:07.360
Oh, yeah. We have six acres,
the horses and the good schools.

34:07.596 --> 34:12.693
And we'll want you to visit--
you know, birthdays, Thanksgiving,

34:13.014 --> 34:15.121
- you're always welcome.
- Oh, thank you.

34:15.137 --> 34:17.610
- Wisconsin's a great place.
- It is.

34:17.716 --> 34:19.623
- Hey, Grandpa?
- Yeah?

34:19.658 --> 34:22.011
What's up with that secret ingredient?

34:27.318 --> 34:30.261
It's secret now-- remember, don't look.

34:32.886 --> 34:35.492
- You guys seen Tony?
- Uh, he left early.

34:35.928 --> 34:39.612
- Gates leave me a message, Frank?
- Lemme check. No.

34:40.098 --> 34:43.693
- I'm out of here. Uh, you leaving?
- Yeah.

34:44.616 --> 34:48.592
Hey! I have info.
About Abby and Luka.

34:49.016 --> 34:52.851
Excuse us, nosy Nellie.
Can you keep a secret?

34:53.317 --> 34:54.803
It's confirmed.

34:55.596 --> 35:00.012
- The wedding is on.
- No way. Wow.

35:00.347 --> 35:04.473
- I guess this means I owe you dinner.
- Have you ever known Abby to be violent?

35:04.627 --> 35:08.163
Your rescue kid is crashing.
Kovac wants you back in Trauma.

35:09.345 --> 35:11.771
- Please, can I go in there?
- No, it's not a good idea, sweetie.

35:11.787 --> 35:13.733
Go back and wait with your mom.
She'll be waking up soon.

35:13.756 --> 35:16.833
I won't freak out. I promise.
Okay, fine, just wait right there.

35:16.858 --> 35:20.381
- What happened?
- Runs of V tach. Need you for CPR.

35:20.398 --> 35:23.410
- Temp's 86.
- Bypass should be available by now.

35:23.436 --> 35:26.050
Let's get the perfusionist down here now!

35:26.505 --> 35:28.520
I'm not cracking his chest.

35:50.126 --> 35:53.541
Excuse me.
Hi, I'm, uh, Samantha Taggart.

35:53.578 --> 35:56.882
- This is my son, Alex.
- Ms. Taggart, we've been expecting you.

35:57.118 --> 36:00.173
Nice to meet you, Alex.
I'm Mrs. Dawson.

36:00.915 --> 36:03.833
Need you to fill this paperwork out.

36:17.396 --> 36:21.351
Ho, yo, Greg, what's up, man?
How you been?

36:22.196 --> 36:24.262
- I'm good. I'm doing good.
- All right.

36:24.705 --> 36:27.543
- How about you?
- How you think?

36:28.435 --> 36:32.390
- Yeah. Stupid-ass question.
- It's good to see you, dawg.

36:32.405 --> 36:35.541
- Been a long time.
- Yeah. Too long.

36:37.476 --> 36:39.243
But seriously, I mean...

36:40.265 --> 36:41.953
How you holding up?

36:44.758 --> 36:46.440
It's hard, man.

36:46.988 --> 36:50.923
Waitin' on trial over a year now.
Food sucks.

36:54.658 --> 36:57.270
Mostly, just miss KJ, you know.

36:58.396 --> 37:00.500
Miss seeing him growing up.

37:01.516 --> 37:05.441
Worry about him... all the time, man.

37:06.218 --> 37:09.123
Then I think about that kid
I hit when I was drunk.

37:10.215 --> 37:14.282
His folks.
What I made them go through.

37:17.567 --> 37:21.430
I don't want this for KJ.
I don't want him to end up like me.

37:21.908 --> 37:24.451
And ain't nothing I can do
about it in here.

37:26.097 --> 37:27.660
Hey, D, um...

37:29.877 --> 37:32.433
...man, I'm sorry I never
wrote you back, man.

37:32.758 --> 37:36.580
- So you got my letters.
- Yeah, I got them.

37:38.377 --> 37:39.960
Should've visited.

37:41.116 --> 37:43.381
On the real, man,
I didn't know what to say.

37:44.158 --> 37:46.711
I just know I hate seeing you in here.

37:48.027 --> 37:52.041
And believe me, I tried to do everything
I could to keep you out of here. But...

37:52.077 --> 37:55.981
Yeah, yo, Greg, don't even
worry about that, man.

37:56.415 --> 37:58.293
All that's on me.

37:58.955 --> 38:02.312
If it hadn't been for you, I'd probably
still be out there drinkin'.

38:05.878 --> 38:08.803
It's all good, baby.
We straight.

38:13.877 --> 38:16.043
You know I'll always be your friend, man.

38:17.077 --> 38:19.523
Thanks for coming.
For real.

38:22.077 --> 38:25.081
Okay, Spencer, can you squeeze my hand?

38:27.798 --> 38:30.300
Come on, Spencer, try to squeeze my hand.

38:32.176 --> 38:35.210
- There you go. Good job.
- Core temp is 94.

38:35.328 --> 38:37.790
- Nice work. ICU ready for him?
- Yep.

38:39.766 --> 38:42.642
- Is he gonna lose the frostbitten toes?
- Three of them don't look salvageable.

38:42.657 --> 38:44.842
- Small price to pay.
- I'm going to call Pratt.

38:44.855 --> 38:46.830
He worked on the family;
I'll tell him the kid's okay.

38:46.846 --> 38:49.262
- Hey, do you want to say hi?
- Can he hear me?

38:49.278 --> 38:51.042
Yeah... yeah, yeah, yeah.

38:54.378 --> 38:56.613
Spence, it's me, Charlie.

38:57.435 --> 38:59.151
You saved us.

39:00.346 --> 39:02.272
You saved us all.

39:04.245 --> 39:06.633
- Okay, let's go.
- Move back, sweetie.

39:53.526 --> 39:54.781
Hello?

39:55.185 --> 39:57.020
Oh, hey, Abby.

39:58.246 --> 39:59.423
Really?

39:59.828 --> 40:01.931
Oh, wow, thas, that's, that's great.

40:02.877 --> 40:07.241
No. No. No, I appreciate the call.
Thanks for calling.

40:07.877 --> 40:10.771
No, no, no, no, I'm fine.

40:11.596 --> 40:16.223
Really, that's really great news.
I'm just... just tired.

40:17.088 --> 40:19.401
Yeah, it's been a long day.

40:20.065 --> 40:21.370
All right then.

40:22.267 --> 40:24.523
All right.
Good night.

40:40.705 --> 40:43.603
- You remember that?
- How could I forget?

40:44.475 --> 40:47.281
Okay, yeah, that was,
that was a fun night.

40:47.965 --> 40:51.002
Oh, God, it seems like a million years ago.

40:51.696 --> 40:53.661
Well, we need to do
that again sometime.

40:53.776 --> 40:56.482
Minus the whiskey.
I can't bounce back like I used to.

40:56.506 --> 40:58.313
Yeah, tell me about it.

40:59.686 --> 41:02.982
Well, thanks for the ride.
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:03.758 --> 41:04.960
Mm, I'm off.

41:07.125 --> 41:11.741
Okay, then...
I'll see you when I see you.

41:12.516 --> 41:13.762
Neela...

41:35.235 --> 41:37.140
We'll just show you to the room then.

41:39.846 --> 41:41.422
Okay, buddy.

41:42.777 --> 41:45.632
Behave yourself, okay?
I'll see you in a couple of weeks.

41:53.166 --> 41:55.191
Mom, I don't want to stay here.

41:57.065 --> 41:59.201
Come on, it's going to be okay.

42:01.978 --> 42:03.311
Mom, please.

42:03.905 --> 42:07.090
I'll be better. I promise.
Okay. I'm sorry.

42:08.637 --> 42:10.511
I'm sorry.

42:11.987 --> 42:13.263
Hey.

42:14.075 --> 42:16.372
You gotta be brave, okay, baby?

42:18.628 --> 42:20.120
I love you.

42:22.358 --> 42:24.580
Mom, I'm sorry, okay?

42:31.477 --> 42:33.222
Mom, please!

42:33.497 --> 42:35.491
Mom, I'll be better, okay?

42:36.096 --> 42:38.340
Mom, I'm sorry!

42:40.107 --> 42:42.701
I'm sorry.
Please.
