NO ONE GETS T.B. ANYMORE.

09:23.875 --> 09:25.834
NOT HERE MUCH,
BUT IT'S ON THE RISE

09:25.875 --> 09:28.041
IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.
WHAT--WHAT ABOUT ELISHA
AND THE BABY?

09:28.083 --> 09:30.041
WHAT IF THEY GET IT?
WE CAN TEST HER.

09:30.083 --> 09:33.041
IF SHE'S POSITIVE,
WE CAN GO AHEAD AND TREAT HER.
THE MASK SHOULD PROTECT HER,

09:33.083 --> 09:35.041
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
I'D LIKE SAM

09:35.083 --> 09:37.291
TO CHECK YOU INTO ST. AMBROSE,
RUN SOME TESTS,

09:37.333 --> 09:39.417
FIND OUT WHAT STRAIN YOU HAVE

09:39.458 --> 09:42.417
AND GET YOU STARTED
ON ANTIBIOTICS.
WAIT, I--IF IMMIGRATION
FINDS OUT I HAVE T.B.,

09:42.458 --> 09:44.041
WHAT ABOUT MY GREEN CARD?

09:44.083 --> 09:47.041
I NEED YOU TO SIGN OFF ON
MY PHYSICAL, TO SAY I'M OKAY.
ESAU...

09:47.083 --> 09:50.250
NO, HIS VISA'S EXPIRED.

09:50.291 --> 09:53.083
IF YOU DON'T SEND THAT FORM IN,
THEY'LL SEND HIM AWAY.

09:53.125 --> 09:55.959
DR. BENNETT, PLEASE.

10:04.583 --> 10:06.667
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

10:06.709 --> 10:09.041
OKAY. SO THE NURSES
ARE FINISHING UP ON HIM.

10:09.083 --> 10:11.041
UH, THEN YOU CAN GO IN.

10:11.083 --> 10:12.750
I PUT HIM ON ANTIBIOTICS

10:12.792 --> 10:15.333
AND TOOK SOME CULTURES
TO VERIFY THE STRAIN.

10:15.375 --> 10:17.041
AND WHAT ABOUT THE FORM,
DR. BENNETT?

10:17.083 --> 10:20.875
I HAVE A LEGAL OBLIGATION
TO TURN THAT FORM IN,

10:20.917 --> 10:23.709
AND I-I CAN'T LIE ON IT.
BUT HE'S GONNA GET DEPORTED.
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MARRIED.

10:23.750 --> 10:25.709
I'M GONNA HAVE HIS BABY
IN A FEW WEEKS.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.709
CAN YOU HOLD OFF
ON SENDING THE FORM IN?
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

10:28.750 --> 10:31.000
WITHHOLDING INFORMATION
FROM THE GOVERNMENT.

10:31.041 --> 10:34.000
IF HE DOESN'T HAVE THAT FORM,
HE'S ILLEGAL AND HE CAN'T WORK

10:34.041 --> 10:36.041
AND HE COULD BE DEPORTED
AT ANY TIME.

10:36.083 --> 10:39.041
I...

10:39.083 --> 10:42.375
OKAY, OKAY, UM...

10:42.417 --> 10:46.125
W-WE'LL JUST GO LIVE
WITH HIS--HIS PARENTS IN KENYA.

10:46.166 --> 10:48.041
ELISHA, UH...

10:48.083 --> 10:50.291
YOU CAN'T LEAVE THE COUNTRY.

10:50.333 --> 10:53.667
IF HE'S GOING,
I'M GOING WITH HIM.
HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE BABY.

10:53.709 --> 10:55.041
HE NEEDS SURGERIES

10:55.083 --> 10:57.375
AND EXTENSIVE CARE
FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS.

10:57.417 --> 11:00.959
YOU WON'T HAVE ACCESS TO
THE CARE THAT HE NEEDS IN KENYA.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.375
(sniffles) OH.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.583
I'LL HOLD OFF
ON--ON SENDING IN THE FORMS.

11:08.625 --> 11:10.792
WE'LL GET HIM TREATED

11:10.834 --> 11:13.959
AND WE'LL WORRY
ABOUT IMMIGRATION LATER.
THANK YOU.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.000
THANK YOU.
OKAY.

11:16.041 --> 11:18.041
OKAY.
OKAY.

11:23.041 --> 11:25.625
THANK YOU, SAM.
YEAH.

11:27.166 --> 11:28.959
(woman) HEY, YOU.

11:29.041 --> 11:31.000
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
AT YOUR OFFICE TODAY.

11:31.041 --> 11:33.542
OH, HEY. NO, CHANGE OF PLANS.
OH.

11:33.583 --> 11:37.792
UH, UH, VANESSA HOYT,
THIS IS ADDISON MONTGOMERY.

11:37.834 --> 11:40.667
VANESSA HOYT
THE, UH, PERINATOLOGIST?

11:40.709 --> 11:42.041
AND NEONATOLOGIST.

11:42.083 --> 11:44.583
I'VE HEARD A LOT
ABOUT YOU, TOO. GOOD THINGS.
FROM SAM?

11:44.625 --> 11:48.041
UM, NO. I DIDN'T REALIZE
THE TWO OF YOU KNEW EACH OTHER.

11:48.083 --> 11:50.792
I-I DIDN'T REALIZE YOU TWO
KNEW EACH OTHER EITHER. YEAH.

11:50.834 --> 11:53.166
WELL, SAM ASKED ME TO CONSULT
ON A CASE LAST WEEK,

11:53.208 --> 11:56.000
AND WE JUST HIT IT OFF.
(chuckles)

11:56.041 --> 11:57.583
WELL, THAT'S NICE...

11:57.625 --> 12:00.041
THAT HE ASKED YOU TO CONSULT
ON A CASE...

12:00.083 --> 12:01.417
YEAH.

12:01.458 --> 12:05.041
INVOLVING A PREGNANT PATIENT
FROM HIS PRACTICE.

12:05.083 --> 12:08.625
SO I HAVE A MINUTE
IF YOU WANT TO GRAB COFFEE?

12:08.667 --> 12:12.041
SURE, SURE. LET'S GO.
OKAY. NICE TO MEET YOU.

12:12.083 --> 12:14.041
(Sam) OKAY.

12:14.083 --> 12:15.667
(Naomi) HEY.

12:15.709 --> 12:16.875
HI.

12:16.917 --> 12:18.875
THANKS FOR FITTING THIS
INTO YOUR DAY.

12:18.917 --> 12:20.834
I THOUGHT MAY WAS HAVING
AN ALLERGIC REACTION,

12:20.875 --> 12:23.625
BUT I-I JUST CAN'T
PIN IT DOWN.
NO WORRIES.

12:26.083 --> 12:28.041
MM.

12:28.083 --> 12:31.792
YOU SEEM... MORE RELAXED
THAN I'VE SEEN YOU IN A WHILE.

12:31.834 --> 12:35.208
WELL, THAT'S WILLIAM.
AH, LOVE.

12:35.250 --> 12:37.709
NO, NOT--NOT LOVE.

12:37.750 --> 12:40.625
WELL, MAYBE EVENTUALLY LOVE.

12:40.667 --> 12:43.041
NO, HE'S WOOING ME.

12:43.083 --> 12:45.834
WELL, I GOTTA HAND IT
TO THE GUY. HE'S GOT CLASS.

12:45.875 --> 12:48.041
AND IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU LOOKING SO HAPPY.

12:48.083 --> 12:49.250
(laughs)

12:49.291 --> 12:52.417
YOU AND ADDISON...

12:52.458 --> 12:55.041
I DIDN'T THINK
ANYBODY KNEW ABOUT THAT.

12:55.083 --> 12:58.208
YEAH, WELL, ADDISON TOLD ME.
WHAT ABOUT YOU AND VIOLET?

12:58.250 --> 13:01.041
VIOLET'S ON VACATION.
WELL, DON'T YOU THINK
THAT COULD BE GOOD FOR VIOLET,

13:01.083 --> 13:04.041
GETTING AWAY FROM IT ALL?
SHE'S SPENT THE LAST NINE MONTHS
AWAY FROM IT ALL.

13:04.083 --> 13:05.834
OH.

13:05.875 --> 13:07.709
OH.

13:07.750 --> 13:09.083
WHAT IS IT?

13:09.125 --> 13:11.333
(Naomi)
THE TESTS FROM YOUR EXAM

13:11.375 --> 13:13.667
SHOW THAT YOU HAD
AN ALLERGIC REACTION.

13:13.709 --> 13:18.083
AND THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT IN
DR. WILDER.
SO WHAT'S SHE ALLERGIC TO?

13:18.125 --> 13:20.125
SHE'S ALLERGIC
TO YOUR SPERM.

13:20.166 --> 13:22.125
MY SPERM?

13:22.166 --> 13:24.792
YES, IT'S A RARE REACTION
TO A PROTEIN IN THE FLUID.

13:24.834 --> 13:26.792
WHICH CAN LEAD TO
AN ANAPHYLACTIC REACTION

13:26.834 --> 13:29.041
THE NEXT TIME
SHE'S EXPOSED.

13:29.083 --> 13:31.041
IT'S SORT OF LIKE
A PEANUT ALLERGY.

13:31.083 --> 13:33.041
ONCE YOU HAVE IT,
THE NEXT TIME'S USUALLY WORSE.

13:33.083 --> 13:35.709
BUT YOU CAN FIX IT, RIGHT?

13:35.750 --> 13:38.083
WELL... (sighs) THIS TYPE
OF ALLERGY IS COMPLICATED.

13:38.125 --> 13:40.083
I'M LOOKING INTO
POSSIBLE TREATMENTS,

13:40.125 --> 13:43.667
BUT RIGHT NOW...
NO, I CAN'T.

13:43.709 --> 13:46.333
(May) WE CAN'T BE ALLERGIC
TO EACH OTHER.

13:46.375 --> 13:49.500
A-AND WHAT ABOUT KIDS? WE BOTH
WANT TO HAVE KIDS SOMEDAY.

13:49.542 --> 13:52.500
AND IF I'M ALLERGIC
TO HIS SPERM--
THAT'S--THAT'S WHERE
WE CAN HELP.

13:52.542 --> 13:54.792
WE CAN WASH THE SPERM
AND INSEMINATE.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.333
AND IF THAT DOESN'T SOLVE
THE PROBLEM,

13:57.375 --> 14:00.041
THEN WE CAN DO IN VITRO
WITH YOUR EGGS.

14:00.083 --> 14:02.625
SO, UH, A BABY SOMEDAY.

14:02.667 --> 14:07.041
BUT--BUT WE CAN'T BE, UM...
INTIMATE?

14:07.083 --> 14:09.750
Y-YES, YOU CAN BE,
JUST SAFELY.

14:09.792 --> 14:12.208
YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE
YOU USE A CONDOM

14:12.250 --> 14:15.583
UNTIL DR. WILDER
CAN FIGURE THIS OUT.

14:15.625 --> 14:18.208
I JUST WANTED EVERYTHING
TO BE PERFECT.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.041
(elevator bell dings)

14:20.083 --> 14:22.041
THANK YOU.

14:22.083 --> 14:23.542
(sighs)

14:23.583 --> 14:25.834
BUENOS DIAS!

14:25.875 --> 14:28.583
WELL, LOOK WHO FORGOT
THE S.P.F.

14:28.625 --> 14:31.792
(laughs) THIS IS FOR YOU.

14:31.834 --> 14:33.208
(inhales deeply)

14:33.250 --> 14:36.583
(clears throat) COSTA RICA--
BEST COFFEE IN THE WORLD.

14:36.625 --> 14:39.583
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
TOUCHING MONKEYS.
THAT WAS THE PLAN,

14:39.625 --> 14:41.583
AND THEN WE WENT
TO THE AIRPORT,

14:41.625 --> 14:44.000
AND WE SAID, "NO PLANS--
COSTA RICA."

14:44.041 --> 14:46.041
WHITE SAND BEACHES,
FABULOUS MUSIC,

14:46.083 --> 14:48.417
A STEADY STREAM OF ALCOHOL...

14:48.458 --> 14:50.333
IT WAS VERY ZEN.

14:50.375 --> 14:53.834
DID YOU JUST SAY "ZEN"
TO ME?
IT WAS RELAXING, CHARLOTTE.

14:53.875 --> 14:56.834
(elevator bell dings)
DID YOU GO TO CENTRAL AMERICA
OR DID YOU JOIN A CULT?

14:56.875 --> 14:58.375
(laughs)
COOP, YOU'RE BACK.

14:58.417 --> 15:00.709
PETE!

15:00.750 --> 15:02.166
HE'S ZEN.

15:02.208 --> 15:06.000
MM. BEST COFFEE
IN THE WORLD. MM-HMM.

15:06.041 --> 15:08.917
UM, I ACTUALLY CAME
TO BORROW A BOOK FROM YOU.

15:08.959 --> 15:11.291
SEMEN ALLERGIES.
I'LL SEE WHAT I HAVE.

15:11.333 --> 15:13.375
SO... WHAT ABOUT VIOLET?

15:13.417 --> 15:15.000
IS SHE ZEN, TOO?

15:15.041 --> 15:17.375
OH, VIOLET. VIOLET, UH,
SHE DIDN'T COME BACK.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.041
SHE DECIDED TO STAY.

15:20.083 --> 15:22.041
(MoZella's "Four Leaf Clover"

15:22.083 --> 15:24.208
(Pete) SHE DECIDED TO STAY?

15:24.250 --> 15:27.917
I-I... SHE WON'T SEE HER KID,
SHE WON'T GET HELP,

15:27.959 --> 15:30.083
AND SUDDENLY
SHE'S A COSTA RICAN WOMAN.

15:30.125 --> 15:32.542
OOH. LIGHT JUST WENT ON
IN THE DEN.

15:32.583 --> 15:35.041
I BET HE'S POURING HER
A GLASS OF WINE--

15:35.083 --> 15:38.333
A BIG OLD GLASS OF RED WINE,
MY WINE.

IT'S OBVIOUS WHAT HE'S DOING.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.333
OOH, OOH. LIGHT JUST WENT OFF
IN THE KITCHEN.

15:45.375 --> 15:47.125

COME AWAY FROM THE WINDOW.

A NUMBER FOR VIOLET.

17:40.083 --> 17:42.875
ONE OF HER PATIENTS--I NEED
TO GET HER ON A PLANE.

17:42.917 --> 17:45.834
I MEAN, VIOLET'S PATIENT,
NOT VIOLET.
NO, SORRY. SHE'S TREKKING
IN THE RAIN FOREST,

17:45.875 --> 17:47.834
NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS.

17:47.875 --> 17:50.709

I'M ALL FOR THERAPEUTIC--

17:55.083 --> 17:57.792

HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL.

17:57.834 --> 18:01.041
SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THEM. SHE KNOWS THEY'RE--
WELL, GREAT, GREAT.
NO PRESSURE THERE.

18:01.083 --> 18:03.041
SORRY. IT'S JUST, UH,

OH, I FOUND ZEN... ONCE.

18:19.166 --> 18:22.458
IT WAS THE BEST COUPLE HOURS
OF MY LIFE.

18:22.500 --> 18:25.041
HOW LONG DOES HE HAVE TO BE
IN QUARANTINE?

18:25.083 --> 18:27.458
UP TO SIX MONTHS.
WE CAN'T RISK AN OUTBREAK.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.458

DRIVE UP TOMORROW.

18:47.208 --> 18:48.792
I DON'T NEED TO FLY.

18:48.834 --> 18:51.792
I CAN HAVE A GOOD LIFE
WITHOUT EVER LEAVING THE GROUND.

18:51.834 --> 18:53.792
YOU WANTED THIS, NATASHA.

18:53.834 --> 18:55.542
WHAT'S THE POINT?

18:55.583 --> 18:57.542
WE'VE BEEN OVER THE CRASH
A HUNDRED TIMES.

18:57.583 --> 19:00.417
THEN LET'S NOT TALK
ABOUT THE CRASH.

19:00.458 --> 19:02.583
LET'S TALK ABOUT YESTERDAY.
OKAY? TALK ME THROUGH IT.

19:02.625 --> 19:05.583
WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT TRIGGERED YOU. OKAY?

19:05.625 --> 19:07.375
(exhales) OKAY.

19:07.417 --> 19:10.792
UM...

19:10.834 --> 19:13.000
WE SAT DOWN.

19:13.041 --> 19:15.375
AND... THEN
THE ANNOUNCEMENT CAME ON,

19:15.417 --> 19:19.125
TALKING ABOUT
THE EMERGENCY PROCEDURES.

19:19.166 --> 19:22.417
AND I WAS STILL OKAY.

19:22.458 --> 19:25.041
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

19:25.083 --> 19:28.333
I MEAN, WHAT STARTED YOU
FEELING ANXIOUS?

19:28.375 --> 19:30.041
I DON'T KNOW.

19:30.083 --> 19:32.959
I JUST FREAKED OUT.

19:33.000 --> 19:36.041
THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE
THINKING BEFORE THAT HAPPENED.

19:36.083 --> 19:40.333
YOU KNOW, YOU TALKED ABOUT
YOUR SISTER AND THE WEDDING...

19:44.000 --> 19:47.333
NATASHA?

19:47.375 --> 19:49.208
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:53.250 --> 19:55.834
IT WAS YOU.

19:55.875 --> 20:00.208
YOU TOUCHED MY ARM
AND TOLD ME TO BREATHE

20:00.250 --> 20:03.041
JUST LIKE SHE DID.

20:03.083 --> 20:05.041
LIKE VIOLET?

20:05.083 --> 20:08.083
NO, THE WOMAN WHO SAT
NEXT TO ME IN THE CRASH.

20:10.875 --> 20:13.375
THE WOMAN I KILLED.

20:22.041 --> 20:24.000
ANY LUCK IN FINDING THEM?

20:24.041 --> 20:26.000
I'VE CALLED EVERYONE
IN ELISHA'S FILE.

20:26.041 --> 20:28.417
NO ONE'S HEARD FROM THEM--
THE GRAD SCHOOL, NOTHING.

20:28.458 --> 20:32.208
AND ESAU
HAS NO FAMILY HERE, SO...
THEY COULD BE ANYWHERE,
INFECTING ANYONE.

20:32.250 --> 20:34.834
WE SHOULD'VE TALKED TO ELISHA
MORE AFTER WE TOLD HER

20:34.875 --> 20:38.208
SHE COULDN'T TAKE HER BABY
OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
YOU'RE SAYING I SCARED HER?

20:38.250 --> 20:41.166
NO, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I SAID, SAM.
ALL RIGHT.
WELL, I'M CALLING IMMIGRATION.

20:41.208 --> 20:45.041
NO, SAM. THAT IS NOT OUR JOB.
WE'RE NOT THE POLICE.
LEAVING ISOLATION
AT THE HOSPITAL

20:45.083 --> 20:49.041
WAS IRRESPONSIBLE.
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO KNOWINGLY
PUT ANYONE AT RISK.

20:49.083 --> 20:52.083
LET ME TRY
AND FIND THEM, OKAY?
NOW YOU'RE BEING IRRESPONSIBLE.

20:52.125 --> 20:54.083
OH, REALLY?
I'M BEING IRRESPONSIBLE?

20:54.125 --> 20:55.375
(scoffs)

20:55.417 --> 20:58.041
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

20:58.083 --> 20:59.917
OH, THIS IS ABOUT VANESSA.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.375
SHE WORKS ON BABIES, SAM.

21:01.417 --> 21:04.041
YOU'RE DATING SOMEONE
YOU THINK WILL GET TO ME.

21:04.083 --> 21:06.500
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE JEALOUS.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:06.542 --> 21:11.041
YOU DON'T GET TO BE JEALOUS
BECAUSE YOU MADE YOUR CHOICE.

21:11.083 --> 21:13.333
SAM, DON'T CALL, OKAY?

21:13.375 --> 21:15.625
LOOK, THEY'RE SCARED.
THEY'RE IN TROUBLE.

21:15.667 --> 21:20.375
THE LAST THING THEY NEED IS
IMMIGRATION COMING DOWN ON THEM.

21:22.500 --> 21:24.959
(crying) I LOOKED OUT
AND...

21:25.000 --> 21:27.542
I SAW THE WING HIT THE GROUND.

21:27.583 --> 21:29.917
AND THERE WAS...
(sniffles)

21:29.959 --> 21:32.458
THERE WAS SMOKE...

21:32.500 --> 21:35.542
AND THEN FIRE...

21:35.583 --> 21:39.166
AND SCREAMING.

21:39.208 --> 21:41.166
I UNBUCKLED MY SEAT BELT.

21:41.208 --> 21:43.792
BUT THE WOMAN NEXT TO ME,
SHE...

21:43.834 --> 21:46.000
SHE COULDN'T
GET HER BELT UNDONE.

21:46.041 --> 21:49.750
AND... SHE WAS SCREAMING,

21:49.792 --> 21:54.375
"HELP ME. PLEASE HELP ME."

21:54.417 --> 21:57.333
BUT I JUST WANTED TO GET OUT.

21:57.375 --> 22:00.250
I WAS SO SCARED.

22:00.291 --> 22:04.291
AND I LOOKED AT HER,
AND SHE WAS SCARED.

22:04.333 --> 22:06.959
BUT I RAN.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.041
(sniffles)

22:08.083 --> 22:10.041
I COULD HEAR HER SCREAMING,
AND...

22:10.083 --> 22:12.542
AND I JUST RAN AWAY.

22:12.583 --> 22:15.542
YOU DIDN'T KILL HER.
THE CRASH DID.

22:15.583 --> 22:19.041
IF YOU HAD STAYED,
YOU WOULD'VE DIED, TOO.
I COULD'VE DONE MORE.

22:19.083 --> 22:22.500
I WAS AWFUL.
I KILLED THAT WOMAN.

22:22.542 --> 22:25.500
(sniffles) I CAN'T
TALK MY WAY OUT OF THAT.

22:25.542 --> 22:28.709
I CAN'T BREATHE MY WAY
PAST IT.

22:28.750 --> 22:30.000
NATASHA--

22:30.041 --> 22:33.458
NO. TELL VIOLET
I'M DONE WITH THERAPY. I QUIT.

22:37.792 --> 22:39.750
(William)
I'M ONLY SAYING,

22:39.792 --> 22:42.166
IF WE CAN BLOCK THE FORMATION
OF CICATRICIAL TISSUE--

22:42.208 --> 22:44.166
THE NEURONS ARE SPARED
PERMANENT DAMAGE,

22:44.208 --> 22:46.667
AND PEOPLE LIKE ME
WOULD BE ABLE TO WALK

22:46.709 --> 22:49.542
NO MATTER HOW BAD
THE INJURY THEY SUSTAINED?

22:49.583 --> 22:53.041
I READ LAST MONTH'S
"NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL," TOO.

22:53.083 --> 22:57.125
I'LL LEAVE YOU TO IT.

22:57.166 --> 22:58.375
FIFE.

22:58.417 --> 23:00.333
I DON'T LIKE
BEING PATRONIZED.

23:00.375 --> 23:02.041
EVEN BY OUR PATRON?

23:02.083 --> 23:04.417
WHAT DO YOU
HAVE AGAINST HIM?

23:04.458 --> 23:06.417
HEY! WHAT?

23:06.458 --> 23:09.458
WILLIAM WHITE DOESN'T KNOW YOU.
HE JUST LIKES THE IDEA OF YOU.

23:09.500 --> 23:11.625
YOU'D BE LIKE
A TROPHY IN HIS CASE.

23:11.667 --> 23:14.041
THAT'S WHAT YOU'D DO FOR HIM.

23:14.083 --> 23:15.500
BUT SINCE I READ ONCE,

23:15.542 --> 23:18.083
WHEN YOU'RE FIGHTING
FOR A GIRL YOU LOVE,

23:18.125 --> 23:20.417
YOU SHOULDN'T PUT DOWN
THE COMPETITION

23:20.458 --> 23:22.417
BECAUSE IT MAKES YOU
LOOK INSECURE,

23:22.458 --> 23:24.417
I'LL BRING IT BACK TO ME.

23:24.458 --> 23:26.875
UM... I KNOW I'M ABRASIVE.

23:26.917 --> 23:30.250
I KNOW I'M SNIDE.

23:30.291 --> 23:32.583
BUT...

23:32.625 --> 23:34.709
YOU MAKE ME A BETTER PERSON.

23:37.083 --> 23:40.834
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO...
FOR ME.

23:43.083 --> 23:46.000
(motor whirring)

23:51.667 --> 23:53.458
(sighs)

23:55.083 --> 23:57.709
YOU GONNA EAT IT
OR MAKE LOVE TO IT?

23:57.750 --> 23:59.083
BANANAS ARE AMAZING.

23:59.125 --> 24:02.083
I WILL NEVER LOOK AT ONE
THE SAME WAY AGAIN.

24:02.125 --> 24:06.041
HERE. YOU CAN HAVE THIS ONE.
I'LL FIND ANOTHER.

24:06.083 --> 24:09.709
OOH! WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
(lowered voice)
CUT THE ZEN CRAP, COOPER.

24:09.750 --> 24:13.709
YOU FOLLOW ME INTO THE BATHROOM
AND THEN TAKE OFF FOR TWO WEEKS.
I KNOW. IT WAS A MISTAKE,
WHICH IS WHY I LEFT.

24:13.750 --> 24:16.917
BUT I'M NOT ANGRY ANYMORE.
WELL, I AM.

24:16.959 --> 24:19.291
THE SEX DIDN'T HAVE TO MEAN
WE WERE A HAPPY COUPLE AGAIN,

24:19.333 --> 24:22.041
BUT IT HAD TO MEAN SOMETHING.
IT DID.
IT MEANT I WAS STILL ANGRY.

24:22.083 --> 24:24.500
I'VE BEEN SITTING ON A BEACH
WITH A THERAPIST

24:24.542 --> 24:26.083
WORKING THIS OUT.

24:26.125 --> 24:29.333
THAT MOMENT HAS PASSED.
WE CAN MOVE ON WITH OUR LIVES.

24:29.375 --> 24:31.458
I FORGIVE YOU.
YOU FORGIVE ME?

24:31.500 --> 24:33.792
YES. OW! OW!

24:33.834 --> 24:35.792
(exhales deeply)

24:35.834 --> 24:37.792
YOU NEED
TO TALK TO SOMEBODY

24:37.834 --> 24:39.667
ABOUT YOUR EATING DISORDER.

24:39.709 --> 24:41.250
SHUT UP.

24:41.291 --> 24:43.041
FIFE'S IN LOVE WITH ME.

24:43.083 --> 24:45.041
REALLY?

24:45.083 --> 24:47.375
MM-HMM.
YOU'RE SURE?

24:47.417 --> 24:49.875
YEAH, BECAUSE HE TOLD ME SO.

24:49.917 --> 24:52.458
HE SAID
I MAKE HIM A BETTER PERSON.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.041
DAMN IT.

24:54.083 --> 24:56.041
YEAH.

24:56.083 --> 24:59.041
JEEZ. HOW DO YOU TURN DOWN
THE GUY IN THE WHEELCHAIR?

24:59.083 --> 25:01.083
WHAT? OH, GOD. I DON'T--

25:01.125 --> 25:03.041
I DON'T EVEN NOTICE
THE WHEELCHAIR ANYMORE.

25:03.083 --> 25:06.041
I MEAN, BUT--BUT WHO...
WHO DOES HE THINK HE IS?

25:06.083 --> 25:09.000
HOW DOES GET OFF LOVING ME?
I MEAN, HE IS MEAN.

25:09.041 --> 25:12.041
HE IS MEAN AND HE IS SARCASTIC
AND HE'S MORALLY ADRIFT.

25:12.083 --> 25:14.041
HE'D STEAL MY D.N.A.
AND CLONE ME

25:14.083 --> 25:16.041
IF HE COULD GET AWAY WITH IT.

25:16.083 --> 25:18.041
HE--HE IS EVERYTHING
THAT I HATE.

25:18.083 --> 25:20.792
NO, HE'S NOT--HE'S NOT ALLOWED
TO--HE'S NOT ALLOWED TO LOVE ME.

25:20.834 --> 25:22.041
OH.

25:22.083 --> 25:24.291
WHAT?

25:24.333 --> 25:25.959
YOU LIKE HIM.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.834
NO. I AM DATING WILLIAM.

25:28.875 --> 25:32.041
YOU LIKE HIM A LOT.

25:32.083 --> 25:34.250
OH, MY GOD.

25:34.291 --> 25:36.041
I LIKE HIM A LOT.

25:36.083 --> 25:39.041
YES.

25:39.083 --> 25:41.375
UH, SHE CAN'T BREATHE.

25:41.417 --> 25:43.792
SHE--SHE THREW UP, AND, UH,
SHE STARTED SWEATING.

25:43.834 --> 25:46.792
SLOW DOWN.
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.
UH, WE USED A CONDOM.
I DON'T KNOW.

25:46.834 --> 25:48.792
WE THOUGHT WE WERE BEING SAFE.

25:48.834 --> 25:51.333
SHE ALMOST STOPPED BREATHING
IN THE AMBULANCE.
(man) EPI'S ON BOARD,

25:51.375 --> 25:53.792
BUT HER PULSE OX IS DROPPING.
(gasping)

25:53.834 --> 25:55.792
I'M GONNA INTUBATE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE...

25:55.834 --> 25:57.750
DON'T TALK. I NEED TO LISTEN.
PREP THE TUBE,

25:57.792 --> 25:59.834
BUT GIVE ME ONE MINUTE.
SHE MAY NOT HAVE A MINUTE.

25:59.875 --> 26:02.667
MAY, I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED...
DR. WILDER!

26:02.709 --> 26:04.667
BUT IT'S MAKING
YOUR BREATHING WORSE.

26:04.709 --> 26:06.875
I NEED YOU TO TAKE
SLOW, DEEP BREATHS.

26:06.917 --> 26:10.041
HENRY, COME TAKE HER HAND.
SLOW, DEEP BREATHS.

26:10.083 --> 26:12.792
FEEL THE AIR FILL YOUR LUNGS.
GOOD.

26:12.834 --> 26:14.709
(inhales deeply)
GOOD. JUST LIKE THAT.

26:14.750 --> 26:17.041
(breathing raspily)

26:17.083 --> 26:20.166
GOOD.

26:20.208 --> 26:22.083
HER AIRWAYS ARE OPENING UP.

26:22.125 --> 26:23.792
(Henry) WHAT HAPPENED?

26:23.834 --> 26:26.792
HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN
AFTER WE TOOK EVERY PRECAUTION?

26:26.834 --> 26:28.166
I DON'T KNOW.

26:28.208 --> 26:29.166
I DON'T KNOW.

26:34.125 --> 26:35.917
HI.

26:35.959 --> 26:40.208
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF THE CONDOM BROKE OR LEAKED.

26:40.250 --> 26:41.834
IT COULD'VE BEEN TOO BIG.

26:41.875 --> 26:44.625
PEOPLE HAVE A TENDENCY
TO BUY 'EM A LITTLE BIG.

26:44.667 --> 26:48.041
ANYWAY, THERE WAS
SEMINAL FLUID PRESENT.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, HENRY.

26:48.083 --> 26:50.041
BUT IT IS.
YOU'RE ALLERGIC TO ME.

26:50.083 --> 26:53.458
WE GOT UNLUCKY. IT BROKE.
HOW OFTEN DOES THAT HAPPEN?

26:53.500 --> 26:55.041
WE'LL BE FINE.

26:55.083 --> 26:57.333
I-I CAN'T HAVE SEX
KNOWING THAT EVERY TIME,

26:57.375 --> 26:59.750
SOMETHING COULD GO WRONG
AND I COULD KILL YOU.

26:59.792 --> 27:01.417
HENRY--
I LOVE YOU.

27:01.458 --> 27:05.041
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D FIND
SOMEBODY WHO GETS ME.

27:05.083 --> 27:08.041
I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE,
BUT THE THOUGHT OF HURTING YOU--

27:08.083 --> 27:10.041
GUYS, GUYS,
LET ME FIND SOMETHING.

27:10.083 --> 27:14.333
THE LAST THING I WANT
IS FOR YOU TO... FORGO SEX.

27:14.375 --> 27:17.041
I WILL FIND A WAY. OKAY?

27:17.083 --> 27:19.834
(monitor beeps rhythmically)

27:26.333 --> 27:28.375
I HAVEN'T BEEN STOOD UP
SINCE...

27:28.417 --> 27:30.000
OH, THAT'S RIGHT. EVER.

27:30.041 --> 27:32.000
I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU
FOR LETTING ME EXPERIENCE

27:32.041 --> 27:33.583
THAT UNIQUE HUMILIATION

27:33.625 --> 27:37.166
THAT I HAD SOMEHOW MANAGED
TO ESCAPE... UNTIL NOW.

27:39.500 --> 27:42.959
I WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET YOU
BACK AT YOUR PLACE.

27:43.000 --> 27:45.083
YOU'RE JUST REMEMBERING THIS?

27:45.125 --> 27:47.041
VANESSA, I'M SO SORRY.

27:47.083 --> 27:50.041
I HAD A PATIENT, AND--AND HE'D
LEFT THE HOSPITAL.

27:50.083 --> 27:51.959
I'M SO SORRY.

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
I LIKE YOU, SAM.

27:54.041 --> 27:56.166
I COULD REALLY
SEE MYSELF WITH YOU.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.709
AND A FEW YEARS AGO, I'D HAVE
IGNORED THIS VOICE IN MY HEAD

27:58.750 --> 28:00.792
THAT SAYS
YOU'RE NOT WHERE I AM.

28:00.834 --> 28:03.583
I'D TRY AND MAKE YOU FEEL
WHAT I'M FEELING.

28:03.625 --> 28:06.625
I-I FEEL... I LIKE YOU.

28:06.667 --> 28:08.583
ADDISON MONTGOMERY.

28:08.625 --> 28:11.166
MY ENTIRE PROFESSIONAL LIFE,

28:11.208 --> 28:14.166
I HAVE BEEN RIDING
IN THE SHADOWS OF THE REPUTATION

28:14.208 --> 28:16.792
OF THE FAMOUS
DOUBLE BOARD CERTIFIED REDHEAD.

28:16.834 --> 28:19.792
I AM NOT GONNA DO IT
IN MY PERSONAL LIFE, TOO.
AD-ADDISON AND ME--

28:19.834 --> 28:22.417
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

28:24.208 --> 28:26.041
I'M A CATCH, SAM--

28:26.083 --> 28:27.834
AN HONEST-TO-GOD CATCH.

28:27.875 --> 28:31.792
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
CHASE ME TO CATCH ME.

28:31.834 --> 28:33.583
VANESSA--

28:33.625 --> 28:35.625
(cell phone beeps)

28:42.083 --> 28:44.375
ESAU, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

28:44.417 --> 28:46.417
IT'S ELISHA. SHE'S IN LABOR.
OKAY, LET'S NOTIFY THE O.B.

28:46.458 --> 28:49.041
AND GET HER UPSTAIRS
ON A MONITOR.

28:49.083 --> 28:51.834
YOU'RE DOING GREAT, ELISHA.
WE WERE ON OUR WAY
TO HER MOM'S

28:51.875 --> 28:53.917
BECAUSE I WAS SCARED
ABOUT IMMIGRATION,

28:53.959 --> 28:56.041
BUT THEN
THE CONTRACTIONS STARTED.

28:56.083 --> 28:59.500
COME ON, WE SHOULD GET YOU
BACK TO ISOLATION.
NO, NO. I NEED TO BE WITH HER.

28:59.542 --> 29:01.583
IT'S NOT SAFE
FOR EITHER OF THEM.

29:01.625 --> 29:03.834
COME. COME WITH ME. ESAU.

29:09.417 --> 29:12.041
YOU GONNA PULL YOUR HAIR OUT?

29:12.083 --> 29:14.166
NO, NO.
YEAH, WELL... MAYBE.

29:14.208 --> 29:16.792
I'M NOT SURE BALD'S
THE RIGHT LOOK FOR YOU.

29:16.834 --> 29:19.166
I'M JUST HAVING A BAD RUN.

29:19.208 --> 29:21.166
YOU, TOO? (chuckles)

29:21.208 --> 29:24.834
COOPER'S BACK.
HE'S ALL ZEN.

29:24.875 --> 29:26.041
(sighs)

29:26.083 --> 29:27.417
IT BOTHERS YOU?

29:27.458 --> 29:29.417
I BEAT HIM WITH A BANANA.

29:29.458 --> 29:32.041
YOU GONNA SHRINK ME
AND TELL ME WHY?

29:32.083 --> 29:33.667
HE'S PAST THE ANGER.

29:33.709 --> 29:36.041
YOU'RE AFRAID IT MEANS
HE'S REALLY OVER YOU.

29:36.083 --> 29:38.041
YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD
AT THIS STUFF.

29:38.083 --> 29:40.875
(scoffs) NO.
NO, I'M FAILING EVERYBODY.

29:40.917 --> 29:42.875
I TRY TO HELP PEOPLE,
AND THEY RUN.

29:42.917 --> 29:44.667
VIOLET RAN.
HER PATIENT RAN.

29:44.709 --> 29:46.667
TWO MEANS
YOU'RE FAILING EVERYBODY?

29:46.709 --> 29:49.041
DON'T SHRINKS TELL PEOPLE

29:49.083 --> 29:51.041
TO AVOID GLOBAL STATEMENTS
LIKE THAT?

29:51.083 --> 29:53.041
YEAH, WELL,
IT FEELS LIKE EVERYBODY.

29:53.083 --> 29:55.125
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD
I TRIED TO HELP VIOLET?

29:55.166 --> 29:58.000
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T PUSH TOO HARD.
YOU DIDN'T PUSH HARD ENOUGH.

29:58.041 --> 30:00.125
I CAN'T FORCE A PATIENT
TO CONTINUE THERAPY.

30:00.166 --> 30:03.000
YOU CAN LET HER KNOW
QUITTING'S FOR LOSERS.

30:03.041 --> 30:05.166
NUDGE HER
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

30:05.208 --> 30:07.792
YOU CAN SHOW HER SETTLING
IS A COWARD'S WAY OUT.

30:07.834 --> 30:11.458
OR YOU CAN SIT HERE AND PULL
YOUR HAIR OUT UNTIL YOU GO BALD.

30:11.500 --> 30:13.041
THANK YOU.

30:13.083 --> 30:14.959
WHATEVER.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.041
PETE...

30:20.083 --> 30:22.083
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO FIND A CURE.

30:22.125 --> 30:24.041
(voice breaking)
HE BROKE UP WITH ME.

30:24.083 --> 30:27.542
I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW.

30:27.583 --> 30:30.709
I DIDN'T WANT
TO WASTE YOUR TIME.
I'M SO SORRY, MAY. HERE.

30:33.041 --> 30:35.417
OH. (blows nose)

30:35.458 --> 30:36.750
(sobs)

30:36.792 --> 30:38.166
I CAN'T STOP CRYING.

30:38.208 --> 30:39.792
WELL, I KNOW IT'S HARD,

30:39.834 --> 30:41.792
LOSING SOMETHING
YOU FELT WAS RIGHT,

30:41.834 --> 30:44.375
BUT SEX...

30:44.417 --> 30:46.041
IS IMPORTANT.

30:46.083 --> 30:48.041
AND MAYBE IT'S BETTER
TO END IT NOW

30:48.083 --> 30:50.000
BEFORE IT GOT SERIOUS.

30:50.041 --> 30:52.041
I KNOW I JUST MET HIM,

30:52.083 --> 30:54.041
AND THAT MAY NOT
MAKE SENSE TO YOU,

30:54.083 --> 30:56.041
BUT... OH, HE WAS THE ONE.

30:56.083 --> 31:00.041
I'VE SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE
WAITING FOR SOMEONE LIKE HENRY.

31:00.083 --> 31:03.625
(sobs)
AND NOW HE'S GONE.

31:03.667 --> 31:05.875
(sniffles)

31:05.917 --> 31:08.792
BUT... OH,
HE STILL HAS MY HEART.

31:08.834 --> 31:11.166
AND MAYBE HE ALWAYS WILL.

31:11.208 --> 31:14.041
YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE ELSE.
JUST GIVE IT TIME.

31:14.083 --> 31:17.375
DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?

31:17.417 --> 31:19.792
I DO.

31:19.834 --> 31:21.792
I'M SORRY.

31:24.083 --> 31:27.417
TELL NAOMI TO FORGET ABOUT
THE EGGS, TOO.

31:27.458 --> 31:29.750
I CAN'T DO IT ON MY OWN.

31:29.792 --> 31:31.250
AFTER HENRY...

31:31.291 --> 31:33.000
I'M DONE.

31:36.250 --> 31:38.166
ELISHA'S LABOR
IS PROGRESSING QUICKLY.

31:38.208 --> 31:40.458
BUT THE BABY--
EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD SO FAR.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.458
I'LL HAVE A NEONATAL TEAM
STANDING BY.

31:42.500 --> 31:46.333
I'LL GIVE YOU AN UPDATE AS SOON
AS THE BABY'S BORN, OKAY?

31:50.458 --> 31:53.709
IS THAT ESAU AJAWKE?
YES, IT IS.

31:53.750 --> 31:56.041
I'M AGENT JONES WITH IMMIGRATION
AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT.

31:56.083 --> 31:59.041
I HAVE AN ORDER HERE
TO DETAIN MR. AJAWKE.

32:06.083 --> 32:08.166
ADDISON.

32:08.208 --> 32:11.041
I TOLD YOU NOT TO CALL.
WELL, I DID
WHAT I THOUGHT WAS RIGHT.

32:11.083 --> 32:13.041
HOW IS
TEARING THEM APART RIGHT?

32:13.083 --> 32:16.041
SHE CAN'T GO TO KENYA.
HE CAN'T STAY HERE.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

32:16.083 --> 32:18.041
SOMETIMES LOVE
DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK OUT.

32:18.083 --> 32:19.709
NO, SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T.

32:19.750 --> 32:22.709
OH, COME ON NOW.
I'M TRYING TO MOVE ON HERE.

32:22.750 --> 32:24.291
I'M TRYING TO BE HAPPY.

32:24.333 --> 32:26.041
YEAH, WELL, GOOD FOR YOU.

32:26.083 --> 32:28.667
IN THE MEANTIME, I HAVE TO
DELIVER ELISHA'S BABY--

32:28.709 --> 32:31.083
A BABY THAT ESAU
ISN'T EVEN GOING TO SEE.

32:31.125 --> 32:34.000
HOW ARE THEY
SUPPOSED TO MOVE ON?

32:37.083 --> 32:39.041
"ON SEMEN"?
A LITTLE LIGHT READING?

32:39.083 --> 32:40.083
(laughs)

32:40.125 --> 32:41.750
MAY ALMOST DIED.

32:41.792 --> 32:44.709
HENRY'S CONDOM BROKE
OR LEAKED.

32:44.750 --> 32:46.792
HE LEFT HER.

32:46.834 --> 32:48.709
OH, THAT'S AWFUL.

32:48.750 --> 32:50.166
THEY WERE PERFECT.

32:50.208 --> 32:52.750
IT MAKES YOU WONDER IF THERE'S
SOME KIND OF MESSAGE IN IT--

32:52.792 --> 32:54.750
BIOLOGY TELLING THEM
THEY DON'T BELONG TOGETHER.

32:54.792 --> 32:56.750
WELL... I MEAN,
THERE ARE THE PEOPLE

32:56.792 --> 32:58.750
THAT ARE RIGHT
FOR YOU ON PAPER,

32:58.792 --> 33:01.458
AND THEN THERE ARE THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE JUST RIGHT.

33:01.500 --> 33:03.000
IS IT SETTLING

33:03.041 --> 33:06.333
IF YOU GO WITH THE PERSON
WHO'S RIGHT FOR YOU ON PAPER?

33:06.375 --> 33:08.291
MAYBE THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH SETTLING...

33:08.333 --> 33:11.333
WITH BEING WOOED.
SOMETIMES THE PERSON
WHO'S JUST RIGHT...

33:11.375 --> 33:13.083
DOESN'T WANT YOU.

33:13.125 --> 33:17.375
OR THEY DO,
AND THEY ARE JUST... WRONG.

33:17.417 --> 33:18.834
YEAH.

33:22.041 --> 33:23.792
ARE WE GONNA HAVE--

33:23.834 --> 33:27.041
HAVE THIS DISCUSSION? NO, NO.
NO, OKAY.

33:27.083 --> 33:30.291
OH. GOD, I REALLY WANTED MAY
TO GET HER GUY.

33:30.333 --> 33:32.417
ME, TOO.

33:35.625 --> 33:37.458
(clicks keyboard keys)

33:44.834 --> 33:47.750
(rings doorbell)

33:47.792 --> 33:50.542
I'M SORRY.
THIS ISN'T SOMETHING I DO.

33:50.583 --> 33:53.542
I VALUE YOUR PRIVACY AND YOUR
DECISION TO NOT DO THERAPY.

33:53.583 --> 33:56.041
DR. WALLACE--
NO, I JUST
HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,

33:56.083 --> 33:57.542
AND THEN I'LL LEAVE,

33:57.583 --> 34:00.041
AND YOU CAN DO
WHATEVER FEELS RIGHT FOR YOU.

34:00.083 --> 34:02.792
I WANTED TO BE A SURGEON.
LOOK, I D--I DON'T--

34:02.834 --> 34:05.250
MEDICAL SCHOOL,
STANFORD, 1986--

34:05.291 --> 34:09.375
E.R. ROTATION
DURING MY INTERNSHIP.

34:09.417 --> 34:11.041
(exhales)

34:11.083 --> 34:14.041
MY FIRST NIGHT ON CALL,
THERE WAS A BUS ACCIDENT.

34:14.083 --> 34:16.041
THE PLACE
WAS FLOODED WITH PEOPLE,

34:16.083 --> 34:18.583
AND I WAS ASSIGNED THIS GUY
WHOSE LEG WAS MANGLED,

34:18.625 --> 34:20.583
AND--AND HE WAS IN PAIN.

34:20.625 --> 34:25.417
HE WAS YELLING
AND SCREAMING AT ME, AND...

34:25.458 --> 34:29.041
I COULDN'T STOP THE BLEEDING.

34:29.083 --> 34:31.792
I CALLED FOR HELP,
AND--AND EVERYONE WAS BUSY.

34:31.834 --> 34:35.041
AND THIS GUY, HE--HE STARTED
KICKING AND YELLING AT ME.

34:35.083 --> 34:37.041
AND I LET GO
OF THE COMPRESSION,

34:37.083 --> 34:39.583
AND HE BLED OUT.

34:39.625 --> 34:42.709
AND HE KEPT YELLING AT ME
UNTIL HE WAS DEAD.

34:45.041 --> 34:47.000
I FAKED ILLNESS
FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK,

34:47.041 --> 34:49.458
AND AS SOON AS I COULD,
I SWITCHED TO PSYCHIATRY.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.041
SEE, I RAN.

34:51.083 --> 34:53.667
MY FATHER WAS A SURGEON.

34:53.709 --> 34:57.417
AND THAT'S ALL I EVER WANTED
WAS TO MAKE HIM PROUD.

34:57.458 --> 35:00.542
I HAVEN'T BEEN THROUGH
A PLANE CRASH.

35:00.583 --> 35:02.458
BUT I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

35:02.500 --> 35:06.041
NOT TO PUSH THROUGH
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

35:06.083 --> 35:08.041
AND Y-YOU SAVED YOURSELF,
NATASHA.

35:08.083 --> 35:11.959
THAT-THAT'S NOT WRONG.
NO, IT--IT'S HUMAN. IT IS.

35:12.000 --> 35:14.083
AND I DON'T WANT
TO PUSH YOU TO BE SCARED.

35:14.125 --> 35:16.083
I WANT TO PUSH YOU
PAST BEING SCARED

35:16.125 --> 35:18.959
SO YOU CAN HAVE WHAT YOU WANT,
SO YOU CAN HAVE THE LIFE

35:19.000 --> 35:20.959
YOU WANTED TO HAVE
BEFORE THE CRASH.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.333
AND I KNOW I'M NOT VIOLET,
BUT I CAN HELP YOU.

35:23.375 --> 35:25.458
SO JUST PLEASE...
LET ME HELP YOU.

35:36.709 --> 35:39.625
WE'LL BE HEADING OUT SOON.
MM-HMM.

35:41.208 --> 35:43.417
COPY THAT.

35:45.792 --> 35:48.750
THE AMBULANCE ARRIVED.
WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING HIM NOW.

35:48.792 --> 35:51.166
UH, I'M SORRY. YOU CAN'T.
THE NURSES JUST PAGED ME.

35:51.208 --> 35:53.542
HIS OXYGEN LEVELS
HAVE DROPPED.

35:53.583 --> 35:55.500
IT'S PROBABLY
DUE TO THE INFECTION

35:55.542 --> 35:59.041
OR THE FLUID THAT'S COLLECTING
IN HIS LUNGS.
IS THAT RIGHT?

35:59.083 --> 36:01.041
LOOK, IF YOU TAKE HIM NOW,

36:01.083 --> 36:04.166
YOU'LL HAVE A BODY ON YOUR HANDS
BY THE TIME YOU GET THERE.

36:04.208 --> 36:07.542
THANK YOU.

36:07.583 --> 36:09.041
(Esau coughs)

36:09.083 --> 36:11.166
DR. MONTGOMERY'S
DELIVERING YOUR BABY.

36:11.208 --> 36:13.792
IF YOU WANT TO SEE HIM,
PUT THIS MASK ON

36:13.834 --> 36:16.041
AND START ACTING SICKER.

36:16.083 --> 36:18.166
(coughing)
I THINK YOU'RE LYING.

36:18.208 --> 36:21.041
ARE YOU SURE?
ARE YOU A DOCTOR?
(continues coughing)

36:21.083 --> 36:23.750
YOU MIGHT WANT TO STEP BACK.
HE'S VERY CONTAGIOUS.

36:23.792 --> 36:25.750
WOULDN'T WANT
TO PUT YOU AT RISK.

36:25.792 --> 36:27.125
(coughing continues)

36:27.166 --> 36:29.125
WE'LL WAIT
TILL HE'S STABLE.

36:29.166 --> 36:32.333
(coughing continues)

36:39.583 --> 36:42.166
HENRY.

36:42.208 --> 36:44.875
I ASKED HENRY TO COME
BECAUSE--
HE CAN FIX IT, MAY.

36:44.917 --> 36:46.458
YOU--YOU CAN FIX IT?

36:46.500 --> 36:49.458
I CAN TRY TO FIX IT.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.458
THERE ARE BREAKTHROUGHS
BEING MADE

36:51.500 --> 36:53.458
IN DESENSITIZING PEOPLE
TO THIS TYPE OF ALLERGY.

36:53.500 --> 36:55.041
UH, DESENSITIZING, HOW?

36:55.083 --> 36:57.041
I WOULD USE INJECTIONS
OF HENRY'S SEMINAL FLUID.

36:57.083 --> 36:59.583
MM-HMM.
EXPOSE YOU TO SMALL TRACES

36:59.625 --> 37:02.333
AND BUILD UP
YOUR IMMUNE RESPONSE OVER TIME.

37:02.375 --> 37:05.333
HOW MUCH TIME?
IT COULD TAKE SIX MONTHS,
MAYBE A YEAR.

37:05.375 --> 37:07.959
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
THIS WILL WORK.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.333
LOOK, I TOLD YOU
THAT IT WOULD BE OKAY,

37:10.375 --> 37:12.083
YOU COULD MOVE ON.

37:12.125 --> 37:14.500
BUT WHAT YOU TWO HAVE,
I ENVY IT.

37:14.542 --> 37:19.625
SO MAYBE IT'S ENOUGH TO SURVIVE
FOR SOME TIME WITH NO SEX.

37:19.667 --> 37:22.208

I'VE BEEN
TO SAN FRANCISCO TODAY...

39:09.166 --> 39:11.834
ON A PLANE WITH THE PATIENT
WHO WAS AFRAID TO FLY.

39:11.875 --> 39:15.125
SHE DID GREAT.
SO THAT'S MY WAY OF SAYING,

39:15.166 --> 39:18.583
"THANKS FOR KICKING MY BUTT
INTO GEAR."
CONGRATULATIONS. YOU DID IT.

39:18.625 --> 39:22.041
NO. NO, YOU DID IT. SO TAKE
THE THANKS, TAKE THE SOURDOUGH

39:22.083 --> 39:24.542
AND, UH, WELL, TAKE THIS.

39:29.166 --> 39:31.125
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
A HUGGY-TYPE PERSON.

39:31.166 --> 39:33.583
BUT I, UH, I REALLY NEEDED
TO DO THAT.

39:33.625 --> 39:36.041
DIDN'T KILL ME.

39:36.083 --> 39:37.125
(laughs)

39:37.166 --> 39:40.166
WELL, I SHOULD, UH... GO.

39:42.041 --> 39:44.333
SHELDON.

39:44.375 --> 39:46.333
DO YOU LIKE MARTINIS?

39:46.375 --> 39:49.792
(Phender's "Electric Baby"
playing)

39:49.834 --> 39:52.959
I RAN TRACK IN HIGH SCHOOL.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.959
WELL, I WENT OUT
FOR THE TEAM.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.333
