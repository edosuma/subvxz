00:02.970 --> 00:06.207
*

00:12.313 --> 00:16.717
TOSCA: 1-Adam-13, show us
code six on citizen flag-down.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.787
There's something going on
in there.

00:19.820 --> 00:22.756
(clacking, shuffling)

00:42.743 --> 00:44.478
Cops!

00:45.579 --> 00:49.317
Shots fired! Shots fired!

00:49.350 --> 00:52.386
Officers need help!
Roll SWAT now!

00:52.420 --> 00:55.323
*

00:57.658 --> 00:59.660
(siren wailing)

00:59.693 --> 01:03.164
BUCK: We got five,
six active shooters.

01:03.197 --> 01:06.267
We're gonna be a code six.
We need to initiate an HRT.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.170
Everyone knows their
positions. Keep it clean.

01:09.203 --> 01:10.804
Make it a
work of art.

01:10.838 --> 01:12.306
All right, 15 seconds out.

01:12.340 --> 01:14.808
Lakers play tonight?
Golden State.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.610
Let's clean this up in
time for the second half.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.379
All right,
I want you to fill the gaps,

01:18.412 --> 01:19.647
stay liquid.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.282
You with us, Hondo?
Fill the gaps,

01:21.315 --> 01:23.317
stay liquid.
You say it so damn much, Buck,

01:23.351 --> 01:24.852
I finally got it tattooed
on my ass.

01:24.885 --> 01:27.288
(laughter)
All right, here we go!

01:27.321 --> 01:30.224
(tires screeching)

01:38.366 --> 01:40.134
(groans)
Officer down!

01:40.168 --> 01:41.669
Officer down!

01:41.702 --> 01:44.638
(gunfire continues)

01:49.310 --> 01:50.678
(shouting)

01:52.646 --> 01:56.484
(shouting
in foreign language)

01:57.685 --> 01:59.420
We got rabbits!

01:59.453 --> 02:00.421
You all right?

02:00.454 --> 02:02.223
He took one in the arm.

02:02.256 --> 02:03.557
Ambulance is
on the way.

02:03.591 --> 02:06.260
(panting)

02:06.294 --> 02:07.495
(gunfire)
(grunting)

02:08.796 --> 02:11.165
Move! Move!

02:14.802 --> 02:16.103
(shouts)

02:19.973 --> 02:22.142
(grunting)

02:34.455 --> 02:36.457
BOY:
Mama, fireworks!

02:36.490 --> 02:37.925
Hey, you're okay.
You're okay.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.860
Go inside, hide.

02:39.893 --> 02:42.363
(dogs barking)

02:45.566 --> 02:47.801
I got him!

02:55.409 --> 02:57.345
(gunfire continues)

02:57.378 --> 02:59.713
(shouting in foreign language)

03:04.618 --> 03:06.820
(horns honking)

03:13.594 --> 03:15.463
Hondo, suspect left.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.865
Luca, with me.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.969
(indistinct shouting)

03:23.604 --> 03:25.939
(grunting)

03:30.844 --> 03:33.381
(tires screech)

03:36.817 --> 03:37.818
Get out! Get out!

03:37.851 --> 03:38.919
Situation's going south.

03:38.952 --> 03:40.821
We got to shut this down.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.823
Get out of the car!
I got the guy with the beard.

03:42.856 --> 03:45.025
Yeah, I got Justin Bieber.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.427
DEACON:
We're a gun short here, Hondo.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.496
(grunts)

03:48.529 --> 03:49.763
(screams)

03:49.797 --> 03:51.599
I'll be there!
Start the countdown.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.801
(grunting)

03:53.834 --> 03:56.570
All right, we'll go on my count.
On three.

03:56.604 --> 03:58.872
One...
Take the dude
with the beanie, Hondo.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.343
Two...

04:03.911 --> 04:04.778
Three.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.680
(simultaneous gunshots)

04:06.714 --> 04:08.248
(gasping)

04:10.518 --> 04:12.853
(panting)

04:17.625 --> 04:19.893
(grunts, panting)

04:21.529 --> 04:23.397
(woman screaming)

04:23.431 --> 04:24.898
(people shouting, yelling)

04:24.932 --> 04:26.300
MAN:
Get down!

04:26.334 --> 04:27.968
(shouting continues)

04:42.583 --> 04:44.918
BUCK:
Oh, God.

04:48.756 --> 04:51.291
*

04:57.631 --> 04:59.633
BUCK: Civilian is down.
I repeat, civilian is down.

04:59.667 --> 05:00.734
I need backup.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.636
Hey. We got help coming.

05:02.670 --> 05:03.871
All right, stay with me.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.906
Stay with me.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.040
You're okay.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.376
Just stay with me.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.411
You're all right, stay with me.

05:10.444 --> 05:11.512
I got it, Buck.

05:11.545 --> 05:13.947
(indistinct chatter)

05:13.981 --> 05:16.116
HONDO: Hey, kid.
Look at me, talk to me.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.618
Talk to me, what's your name?

05:17.651 --> 05:19.052
Raymont.
Raymont?

05:19.086 --> 05:20.521
All right.
You live here?

05:20.554 --> 05:22.556
Yeah? Me, too.

05:22.590 --> 05:23.824
I grew up four blocks that way.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.994
I kissed my first girl, Yvonne
Thomas, behind that rec center.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.029
Huh? Come on, you know what
I'm talking about, right?

05:29.062 --> 05:31.064
They still making out
over there?

05:31.098 --> 05:32.766
Huh? Talk to me.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.902
Stay with me. They still
making out over there?

05:34.935 --> 05:36.470
Yeah.

05:36.504 --> 05:38.772
Yeah.
I don't got a girl.

05:38.806 --> 05:41.041
Okay, okay, that's cool. That's
cool, don't even worry about it.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.644
You wait till the girls see this
new scar you're about to have.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.679
You're gonna have
your pick, trust me.

05:45.713 --> 05:47.047
Ambulance went
to the wrong spot.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.782
They're still ten minutes out.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.786
This kid doesn't
have ten minutes.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.955
Luca, get him on the truck.
Let's go. Let's get the doors.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.625
Come on. Come on.
Okay? Let's go.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.760
(crowd clamoring)
MAN: He ain't no gangbanger!

06:01.462 --> 06:03.831
HONDO: I know you're probably
scared right now,

06:03.864 --> 06:05.433
and that's all right.
No, no, no, it's all right.

06:05.466 --> 06:06.800
Scared is good.

06:06.834 --> 06:07.968
It means your brain's
working right,

06:08.001 --> 06:08.969
it means your body's fighting.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.170
You and me, we got this.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.772
We both fight together.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.909
(siren wailing)

06:27.588 --> 06:30.090
I stopped the bleeding,
started a line.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.192
Kid says he's O positive,
blood pressure's dropping.

06:32.225 --> 06:35.162
We got it from here.
Let's go.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.582
*

06:54.615 --> 06:56.950
(siren wailing in distance)

07:09.930 --> 07:11.431
(car door closes)

07:15.035 --> 07:16.737
What happened?

07:16.770 --> 07:18.739
That neighborhood
is all shot to hell.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.108
Not our bullets.
What about the bullet
in that kid?

07:21.141 --> 07:22.643
Well, he's
in surgery now, but...

07:22.676 --> 07:24.912
Doctors say maybe
yes, maybe no.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.113
DEACON: If it
wasn't for Hondo,

07:26.146 --> 07:27.515
he'd have been D.O.A.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.617
Nice save.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.853
Deacon, the team's yours

07:32.886 --> 07:34.087
until Buck's
cleared for duty.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.490
Yes, ma'am.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.176
All right, thanks.

07:56.777 --> 07:57.978
What's the word, Hondo?

07:58.011 --> 08:01.782
Raymont's still in surgery.
We'll know more in the morning.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.517
Man, poor kid.
LUCA:
I mean,

08:03.551 --> 08:05.553
it was an accident.
HONDO: True or not, Luca,

08:05.586 --> 08:08.055
there's too much bad history
for a lot of these folks.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.529
Tomorrow's looking
like a busy day.

08:15.563 --> 08:16.797
Buck will be back.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.832
Soon.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.701
Until then,
let's make him proud.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.936
I'll see you
in the morning.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.105
(exhales)

08:43.056 --> 08:44.324
(gasps)

08:44.357 --> 08:46.193
You scared me.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.762
(laughs)

08:54.001 --> 08:55.703
You don't feel scared to me.

08:55.736 --> 08:58.071
(laughs)

09:01.241 --> 09:04.912
That neighborhood
is so angry.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.648
And it's only
gonna mushroom.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.583
Buck shot an unarmed kid.

09:09.617 --> 09:11.318
It was a
split-second call.

09:11.351 --> 09:14.221
Bullets were flying.

09:15.823 --> 09:20.193
Listen, there's something else
I need to talk to you about.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.330
What's that?

09:23.363 --> 09:25.866
Us.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.268
This is more than just
hooking up at this point.

09:28.301 --> 09:31.204
You have a key, toothbrush,
change of clothes.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.307
I'm about to get my
own coffee cup, right?

09:34.341 --> 09:37.077
Hmm?
(both laugh)

09:37.110 --> 09:38.912
Think you've earned it?

09:38.946 --> 09:41.281
You tell me.

09:43.183 --> 09:45.318
Actually...

09:45.352 --> 09:48.155
(drawer opens, closes)

09:48.188 --> 09:50.724
...I meant this.

09:58.198 --> 10:01.101
"Professional
relationship disclosure"?

10:01.134 --> 10:02.269
This is a joke, right?

10:02.302 --> 10:04.237
It's department policy.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.773
It's a policy that
everybody ignores.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.274
I'm a woman.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.342
I'm young. I'm an immigrant.

10:09.376 --> 10:13.213
That's three strikes
for a lot of the brass.

10:15.716 --> 10:19.820
You don't want to call it
a relationship, officially.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.222
I like this, obviously.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.324
But I'm not gonna
lose my career over it.

10:24.357 --> 10:25.726
I spent the last 12...

10:25.759 --> 10:27.227
Okay. Hey, hey, hey.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.231
I'll sign it.

10:31.264 --> 10:32.866
You will?

10:32.900 --> 10:34.134
Yeah.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.976
(laughs)

10:46.446 --> 10:48.381
MAN: Yeah, I know.
We're changing now.

10:48.415 --> 10:50.417
We're doing a live feed.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.886
(reporters chattering)

10:54.955 --> 10:56.924
(chatter continues)

10:56.957 --> 10:59.292
*

11:04.497 --> 11:06.867
(tires screech)

11:13.306 --> 11:15.342
There you are.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.946
Hicks needs you right now.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.449
What the hell is this?

11:22.482 --> 11:23.751
Just smile and nod.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.953
We'll talk afterwards.

11:36.263 --> 11:40.167
In the course of responding to
an attack on two police officers

11:40.200 --> 11:41.969
last night, the SWAT unit

11:42.002 --> 11:45.138
to my right killed four
suspects and rescued a family

11:45.172 --> 11:47.507
who had been carjacked.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.944
Well, sadly, a 17-year-old
young man, Raymont Harris,

11:50.978 --> 11:54.314
was accidentally shot
and seriously injured

11:54.347 --> 11:56.483
by team leader, Buck Spivey.

11:56.516 --> 12:00.220
Now, this morning,
I terminated Sergeant Spivey.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.756
SWAT demands
the highest standards,

12:02.790 --> 12:04.792
and Angelenos
have the right to know

12:04.825 --> 12:08.428
that actions have consequences.

12:08.461 --> 12:12.232
Sergeant Harrelson,
would you please join me?

12:15.969 --> 12:18.939
Today I am assigning
20-David designation,

12:18.972 --> 12:22.175
the senior SWAT sergeant
and command of this unit,

12:22.209 --> 12:24.878
to Sergeant Daniel Harrelson,

12:24.912 --> 12:28.148
who exhibited immense bravery
under fire

12:28.181 --> 12:29.983
to prevent last night's incident

12:30.017 --> 12:34.454
from becoming far worse than
what it otherwise might've been.

12:34.487 --> 12:35.989
So, please join me

12:36.023 --> 12:38.926
in congratulating
Sergeant Harrelson

12:38.959 --> 12:41.494
on a well-deserved appointment.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.174
Good work, gentlemen.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.976
Hicks made the decision himself
this morning.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.444
And he thinks

12:57.477 --> 12:59.412
promoting a black man on live TV
is gonna fix that?

12:59.446 --> 13:00.948
JESSICA: He thinks it's
better than doing nothing.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.850
Come on, Jess.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.317
The people there can see
right through this kind of BS.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.419
They know the difference
between a press conference

13:06.453 --> 13:07.387
and what really goes down

13:07.420 --> 13:08.455
on the street.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.356
How many times have you told me

13:09.389 --> 13:10.457
there's a better way
to do things here?

13:10.490 --> 13:13.861
Treat the community like family
rather than the enemy.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.228
Now's your chance to prove it.

13:15.262 --> 13:16.897
He doesn't want my ideas.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.165
He wants a mascot.

13:18.198 --> 13:19.432
He's giving you a team.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.334
What you do with it
is up to you.

13:21.368 --> 13:22.936
Deacon was up next.

13:22.970 --> 13:24.404
Deacon is a good man.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.940
You lead, he'll follow.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.441
All right,
until I can figure out a way

13:28.475 --> 13:29.910
to get Buck back on this team,

13:29.943 --> 13:31.078
give me Rankins.

13:31.111 --> 13:32.245
You're getting Jim Street.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.181
Who is Jim Street?

13:34.214 --> 13:35.949
Transfer from Long Beach.

13:37.617 --> 13:40.353
So now I got to break in
a new guy?

13:40.387 --> 13:41.855
We're starting you slow.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.056
Hicks wants you at
the protest rally.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.457
Starts in an hour.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.059
Thanks.

13:46.093 --> 13:48.028
Crowd control. No.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.396
I want to be out there
trying to get the guy

13:49.429 --> 13:50.530
we just lost last night.

13:50.563 --> 13:53.100
The gun dealer you caught
last night, Yorba Glennon,

13:53.133 --> 13:55.168
was selling weapons to
the man who got away.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.236
Doesn't know his name.

13:56.269 --> 13:57.938
Okay, so we'll look into it.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.372
Mumford's team is running point.

13:59.406 --> 14:02.375
You're gonna give Mumford
the good lead?

14:02.409 --> 14:04.211
And me
community relations?

14:04.244 --> 14:06.546
You know I'm not that guy.

14:06.579 --> 14:09.149
If anyone can bridge the gap
between that community

14:09.182 --> 14:11.985
and the police, it's you.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.595
(grunting)

14:25.598 --> 14:27.534
Buck got boned big-time.

14:27.567 --> 14:28.902
How do we fix this?

14:28.936 --> 14:30.437
They can't just fire him

14:30.470 --> 14:32.672
without having done
an investigation.
They just did.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.909
And Hondo's great and all,
but that job's yours, Deac.

14:35.943 --> 14:38.078
I mean, all the years
that you put in and waited.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.913
I mean, you earned it.
HONDO: No one knows

14:39.947 --> 14:41.314
Buck got screwed more than me.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.350
I learned everything I
know about SWAT from him,

14:43.383 --> 14:46.053
so I'm not about
to switch up anything.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.554
Now, we have to change
into our dress blues.

14:47.587 --> 14:48.555
We're going to Avalon Park

14:48.588 --> 14:50.057
to keep the peace.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.224
We heading out a man down?

14:51.258 --> 14:52.292
HONDO:
Nope.

14:52.325 --> 14:55.162
Getting Jim Street.

14:55.195 --> 14:56.363
Who?

14:56.396 --> 14:58.565
*

15:02.235 --> 15:04.704
* I got a one-way street
and I'm ready to roll *

15:04.737 --> 15:07.007
(siren wailing)
* Uh-huh

15:08.741 --> 15:11.578
* Yeah, we're blacktop burning
and I'm out of control *

15:11.611 --> 15:15.983
* All right, all right

15:16.016 --> 15:21.021
* Yeah, the flag goes down,
I'm ahead of the pack now. *

15:27.160 --> 15:29.129
Just leave the ticket
on my bike.

15:29.162 --> 15:32.966
I'm late for work! Sorry!

15:35.402 --> 15:37.370
You Hondo?

15:37.404 --> 15:39.106
Jim Street.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.608
You're cutting it
a little close, Street.

15:41.641 --> 15:45.178
Sorry, yeah, I, uh, hit, like,
a thousand red lights.

15:45.212 --> 15:46.346
We don't do excuses here.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.048
And you're in
the wrong uniform.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.416
Go get changed up.
We're rolling out.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.584
Music to my ears.
Don't worry about me.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.386
You just point me in
the right direction.

15:53.420 --> 15:54.754
Here to kick ass.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.656
SWAT isn't
about kicking ass.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.191
It's about saving lives.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.427
Yeah, which
sometimes requires

16:00.460 --> 16:02.362
kicking a little ass.

16:02.395 --> 16:05.365
Right?

16:05.398 --> 16:07.500
MUMFORD:
Hey-hey! If it isn't

16:07.534 --> 16:08.601
America's top cop.

16:08.635 --> 16:09.702
Did you drive into work
this morning

16:09.736 --> 16:10.737
or swing
from building to building

16:10.770 --> 16:12.205
like Spider-Man?

16:12.239 --> 16:14.207
(laughs)
Spider-Man.

16:14.241 --> 16:16.343
Those were Hicks'
words, not mine.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.011
STREET: I miss some kind
of drama or is this guy's

16:18.045 --> 16:20.047
default button just
set on dick mode?

16:20.080 --> 16:22.049
Don't know who
your new smart-ass is,

16:22.082 --> 16:23.116
but good luck with that.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.717
We're on our way
to find the guy

16:24.751 --> 16:26.786
that Buck let
get away last night.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.356
Later.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.626
*

16:49.642 --> 16:51.411
MAN:
Hondo.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.148
How you doing, brother?

16:55.182 --> 16:56.449
Doing good.

16:56.483 --> 16:57.717
So you here for business
or pleasure?

16:57.750 --> 16:59.586
Here on business, Dale.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.321
But also making sure that you're
not stealing too many hearts

17:01.354 --> 17:04.057
from all these fine ladies
out here.
(laughs)

17:04.091 --> 17:07.327
So, I saw on the TV that
you got some big promotion.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.461
Does that mean
that you can do

17:08.495 --> 17:10.230
something about
what's going on?

17:10.263 --> 17:13.166
I aim to try, Dale.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.202
Well, I'll be watching.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.104
We all will be.

17:17.137 --> 17:21.441
Say hi to your aunt
and nieces for me.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.677
I'll see you around.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.313
MAN: What color you
supposed to be, brother?

17:26.346 --> 17:27.414
Black or blue?

17:27.447 --> 17:30.550
You gonna have to pick.

17:31.851 --> 17:33.653
I saw your K-9 patch.
Where's the mutt?

17:33.686 --> 17:35.288
Champ? Just retired.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.424
His hip started to go.

17:37.457 --> 17:38.758
I got him at my place.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.660
I'm getting ready
to train a new dog.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.362
You pick one out yet?

17:42.395 --> 17:44.097
Nope. Still choosing.

17:44.131 --> 17:45.598
Maybe, uh,

17:45.632 --> 17:50.737
off-duty, you could
teach me a few tricks.

17:51.738 --> 17:55.175
I like dogs, not dawgs.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.709
LUCA: Hey, texted with
a buddy down in Long Beach

17:56.743 --> 17:58.211
about you, Street.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.613
Sounds like it ended
pretty rocky down there.

18:00.647 --> 18:02.482
Anything we should know?
Nothing stays secret

18:02.515 --> 18:04.684
too long in SWAT.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.753
I plan on keeping any
secrets from you guys,

18:06.786 --> 18:08.455
I'll let you know.

18:13.260 --> 18:14.727
Hey, Deac.

18:14.761 --> 18:18.131
I was thinking me and you
could go grab a beer one night.

18:18.165 --> 18:21.134
Talk about ways to make
the team more efficient.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.337
Depends on the night.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.609
(over speakers):
I'm Gerald Ewing,

18:29.642 --> 18:31.278
and Raymont Harris
is my cousin.

18:31.311 --> 18:34.781
Raymont's a straight "A" student
at his high school.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.683
Last night,
picking up some groceries,

18:36.716 --> 18:38.185
a cop shot him.

18:38.218 --> 18:41.488
This is the third
police shooting here

18:41.521 --> 18:43.156
in the last six months.

18:43.190 --> 18:46.159
You don't see them shoot people
in Brentwood, do you?!

18:46.193 --> 18:47.527
CROWD: No!
Bel Air?!

18:47.560 --> 18:48.561
CROWD:
No!

18:48.595 --> 18:50.363
How many times are we gonna

18:50.397 --> 18:52.165
let this happen before some...
(gunshot)

18:52.199 --> 18:53.533
(grunts)
(woman screams)

18:53.566 --> 18:56.203
(crowd screaming)

18:56.236 --> 18:58.271
(gunfire)

19:02.375 --> 19:04.611
The roof! Northeast!

19:10.283 --> 19:13.253
Go, go, go.
Go, go!

19:13.553 --> 19:14.621
(tires screeching)

19:14.654 --> 19:16.423
WOMAN:
Hey! You crazy?!

19:37.410 --> 19:39.446
(sirens wailing in distance)

19:40.647 --> 19:41.814
CHRIS:
Nothing.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.883
Nope.
Nada.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.453
Hey. You're a hot mess.

19:46.486 --> 19:47.920
You're out of position,
you're moving too fast.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.456
They teach you anything
down in Long Beach?

19:49.489 --> 19:50.557
Moving too fast?

19:50.590 --> 19:52.392
I was trying to get to
the shooter before he got away.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.361
By running through the middle
of the park with no cover?

19:54.394 --> 19:57.264
I got here before
anyone else, didn't I?

19:57.297 --> 19:59.866
Lesson one, Street.

19:59.899 --> 20:02.502
Never be in a hurry to die.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.975
(sirens continue wailing)

20:18.985 --> 20:20.920
Dead cop. Dead civilian.
Both white.

20:20.953 --> 20:22.855
Someone knew what
they were doing.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.557
Expert shot, line of
sight, escape route.

20:24.591 --> 20:26.259
Best we could do
from security cameras.

20:26.293 --> 20:27.627
No I.D.

20:27.660 --> 20:29.462
We know the shooter's
black-- racial payback

20:29.496 --> 20:30.997
for the Raymont
Harris shooting.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.732
MUMFORD:
Robbery-Homicide found some

20:32.765 --> 20:33.766
unusual shell casings.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.834
Might track back
to the sniper.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.002
Best lead we have.

20:36.035 --> 20:38.438
Couple different ways I can
think of to track that down.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.340
Coordinate with RHD,
take point on it.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.575
You bet.
Hondo, your team will
pick up any spillover duties.

20:42.609 --> 20:44.844
At least until there's
another press conference?

20:47.079 --> 20:49.316
These are outstanding warrants
for felons

20:49.349 --> 20:51.818
in a three-mile radius
of the park shooting.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.987
Coordinate with South Bureau's
Gang Enforcement.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.989
Start knocking some doors down;
I want to see what oozes out.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.291
I want to make
that neighborhood hurt.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.659
HONDO:
Those are proud people

20:59.692 --> 21:01.428
who usually get
the short end of the stick,

21:01.461 --> 21:02.829
and you want to make them hurt?

21:02.862 --> 21:04.597
They started a war
with us, Hondo.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.666
Black on white.
Maybe you noticed.

21:06.699 --> 21:08.835
So we're gonna squeeze 'em,
until someone tells us

21:08.868 --> 21:10.637
who did this. Clear?

21:10.670 --> 21:12.739
Crystal.
Pick out the promising ones,

21:12.772 --> 21:15.375
give the others to Hondo.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.410
Don't come back empty-handed.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.011
Be careful, but be quick.

21:19.045 --> 21:20.980
We already had a bank robbery
we couldn't respond to

21:21.013 --> 21:23.316
because of this shooting.

21:26.953 --> 21:29.389
Hey. Guess who's
in the locker room.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.026
Get out of here, Hondo.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.862
You don't want to be
around my stink.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.097
We're gonna fix this. I'm
gonna push Hicks and Cortez.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.466
This is not
the end, Buck.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.568
Stop. All right, it's over.

21:41.601 --> 21:42.869
I was chasing
a white suspect,

21:42.902 --> 21:45.505
end up shooting
an unarmed black kid.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.874
Not exactly protocol.
It was an accident.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.809
Not one that I would
tolerate on my team.

21:49.842 --> 21:51.077
Buck, this is wrong.

21:51.110 --> 21:52.645
Look, you and Jenny,
come over the house,

21:52.679 --> 21:54.447
I'll make that gumbo you
like, and then we'll...

21:54.481 --> 21:56.849
Jenny... Jenny left.
Four, five months ago.

21:56.883 --> 21:59.051
How come you didn't
say anything?

21:59.085 --> 22:00.587
Because I wasn't looking
for sympathy.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.589
I wanted to do the job.

22:02.622 --> 22:03.890
It's your job now.

22:03.923 --> 22:05.091
This is some job.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.494
Hicks got me running around,
just smiling for the cameras,

22:07.527 --> 22:10.597
and now he sandbags me and puts
this Street kid on the team.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.899
I asked Hicks to put Street
on the team in my place.

22:12.932 --> 22:15.101
Why? What do you even
know about the guy?

22:15.134 --> 22:16.736
Yeah, I've been watching
him for a while.

22:16.769 --> 22:17.904
I think he's got potential.

22:17.937 --> 22:19.472
I can't be here to help him,

22:19.506 --> 22:21.608
I'm-I'm hoping you will.
I got enough troubles

22:21.641 --> 22:23.410
without trying to get
this kid over the hump.

22:23.443 --> 22:25.378
Here's a dirty little secret.

22:25.412 --> 22:27.480
I had no idea what
I was doing half the time.

22:27.514 --> 22:28.948
You know, I mean,
I think the key was

22:28.981 --> 22:30.617
to not let you clowns
realize it.

22:30.650 --> 22:34.353
Don't run the team the way
that I would. Be Hondo.

22:35.121 --> 22:37.890
You find your own way.

22:38.791 --> 22:41.360
Stay liquid.

22:46.599 --> 22:48.768
Warrant bingo.

22:48.801 --> 22:49.802
Great.

22:49.836 --> 22:51.538
Needle-in-a-haystack time.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.840
Hey, we don't write
the music, we just play it.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.408
It's wrong.

22:56.609 --> 22:57.944
Taking the fight
to South L.A. is just wrong.

22:57.977 --> 23:00.947
It won't work.
Well, those are the orders.

23:03.483 --> 23:05.418
And this is my team.

23:05.452 --> 23:06.453
Hicks wants to fire me,

23:06.486 --> 23:08.087
let him fire me.

23:08.120 --> 23:11.090
But we're gonna go
a different way.

23:11.123 --> 23:14.794
Which way is that?

23:16.929 --> 23:19.799
We treat 'em like family.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.837
(phones ringing, lively chatter)

23:24.871 --> 23:27.406
WOMAN:
Excusez-moi.

23:32.078 --> 23:35.114
(rap music playing
over speakers)

23:35.147 --> 23:38.017
Hey, ladies.
Hey.

23:40.186 --> 23:43.790
One for each of us.

23:43.823 --> 23:45.892
(woman laughs)

23:45.925 --> 23:48.495
Ooh, and one for Denise.

23:48.528 --> 23:50.930
Hondo.

23:50.963 --> 23:53.866
Don't tell me, you finally came
down here to propose to me?

23:53.900 --> 23:56.569
Come on now, Bree, I done
told you a thousand times,

23:56.603 --> 23:58.137
you way too much woman for me.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.607
Only one way to find out
for sure.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.209
(laughs) Girl, you don't
ever quit, do you?

24:03.242 --> 24:05.545
Not till you come to
your senses. (laughs)

24:05.578 --> 24:07.547
I got to talk a little business.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.982
We're looking into
that park shooting

24:10.016 --> 24:12.218
down the block,
and we both know,

24:12.251 --> 24:13.920
don't nothing happen
in this zip code

24:13.953 --> 24:15.054
that doesn't get
discussed or dissected

24:15.087 --> 24:16.923
by the ladies
up in this room.

24:20.059 --> 24:24.664
I'm not sure it'll help,
but maybe talk to Jemele.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.800
Jemele, you got a little
something I can use?

24:29.702 --> 24:31.571
My friend Penny,

24:31.604 --> 24:34.574
she has this ex who's always
trying to get back with her.

24:34.607 --> 24:35.942
Texted her this afternoon,
talking about

24:35.975 --> 24:38.778
he saw the shooter driving away
from the park.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.847
Now, Penny figured it was just
another one of his lies,

24:40.880 --> 24:42.682
but, well, you know how that go.

24:42.715 --> 24:45.117
You think you can get
this Penny on the phone?

24:45.151 --> 24:48.921
(scoffs)
Of course I can.

24:53.660 --> 24:56.028
*

24:56.062 --> 24:58.130
What's up, shorty?
You're a hard man to find.

24:58.164 --> 25:00.533
I know you?

25:01.768 --> 25:05.872
Dogs for all my guys, please.

25:07.907 --> 25:09.876
You know, when you
witness a crime,

25:09.909 --> 25:11.944
you're supposed to
tell the police.

25:11.978 --> 25:14.046
Brother, I ain't seen no crime.
Oh, yeah?

25:14.080 --> 25:18.217
Then why'd you text this
to Penny girl?

25:18.250 --> 25:20.753
You talk to Penny?
What she say about me?

25:20.787 --> 25:23.322
Come on now, you know you got
to say something to me first.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.791
(sighs)

25:24.824 --> 25:26.292
What'd you see, shorty?

25:27.259 --> 25:29.929
I was setting up down the road
from the park.

25:29.962 --> 25:31.664
Figured I'd make
a couple dollars, you know,

25:31.698 --> 25:33.566
'cause the rally
was going on.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.267
Heard some shots,
30 seconds later,

25:35.301 --> 25:37.103
tow truck came ripping
right past me.

25:37.136 --> 25:39.171
Tow truck? Wait, so you didn't
actually see a shooter?

25:39.205 --> 25:41.974
Not sure if it was the shooter
or not, but...

25:42.008 --> 25:44.611
he was driving fast,
like he ain't want to be there.

25:44.644 --> 25:45.778
Did you see who was
behind the wheel?

25:45.812 --> 25:47.279
You see a name on the truck?

25:47.313 --> 25:48.948
No, just a logo, like,
like an anchor or something.

25:48.981 --> 25:51.183
That sounds like
Hook & Go Towing.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.319
Used to be Old Man Roger's
place before he died.

25:53.352 --> 25:54.687
I'm not sure who owns it now.

25:54.721 --> 25:55.922
Guess we better find out.

25:55.955 --> 25:58.891
Ooh.

25:58.925 --> 26:00.226
Mmm.

26:00.259 --> 26:02.261
So what Penny got to say
about me?

26:03.730 --> 26:05.898
I think it's time for you to
look for other options, shorty.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.233
You sure?

26:07.266 --> 26:09.636
Damn sure.

26:13.272 --> 26:16.242
*

26:34.226 --> 26:36.228
Can I help you?

26:36.262 --> 26:38.330
Tell him we're looking
for a black guy.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.833
Yeah, are you the owner here?
Yeah, that's right.

26:40.867 --> 26:42.702
We're Metro SWAT.
We're talking to people

26:42.735 --> 26:44.403
in the neighborhood
about the park shooting.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.537
Anyone take that tow truck
out today?

26:45.571 --> 26:48.274
Yeah, Luis ran some errands
earlier this afternoon.

26:48.307 --> 26:50.242
You buy this place
from Old Man Rogers?

26:50.276 --> 26:52.912
My uncle did. I run it now.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.146
What's your name?

26:54.180 --> 26:55.715
(laughs) Why?

26:55.748 --> 26:57.249
Did I do something wrong?

26:57.283 --> 26:59.251
How 'bout you cops go roust
some actual criminals?

26:59.285 --> 27:00.687
STREET:
How 'bout you show

27:00.720 --> 27:02.655
a little respect?
Answer the question.

27:02.689 --> 27:03.856
Why don't you take your
question and shove...

27:03.890 --> 27:04.857
Hey-hey-hey, chill out.
Chill out.

27:04.891 --> 27:06.025
Chill out.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.760
Talk to me.

27:07.794 --> 27:10.396
So no one else has access
to that tow truck out there?

27:10.429 --> 27:13.232
(laughs) No.
Just the two of us.

27:13.265 --> 27:15.234
DISPATCHER:
20-David, 20-David,

27:15.267 --> 27:17.403
50-David in need of
immediate assistance

27:17.436 --> 27:19.171
at the intersection
of 22nd and Hooper.

27:19.205 --> 27:21.774
Let's go.
On our way.

27:21.808 --> 27:23.876
Nice chatting.

27:23.910 --> 27:25.011
(crowd clamoring)
MAN: That's what you doing!

27:25.044 --> 27:27.146
Here we go again!

27:27.179 --> 27:28.280
Stop and look
what they doing!

27:28.314 --> 27:29.682
We'll take care of this!

27:29.716 --> 27:30.883
You got to stay calm.

27:30.917 --> 27:33.786
I need you to stay calm.
(sirens wailing)

27:33.820 --> 27:35.187
This will be over soon.

27:35.221 --> 27:37.389
Please, just stay calm
and let us...

27:37.423 --> 27:38.791
MAN:
Really? Really?

27:38.825 --> 27:41.728
(clamoring continues)

27:43.062 --> 27:45.297
HONDO:
Everybody! Everybody, back up!

27:45.331 --> 27:47.399
This does not need to escalate!

27:47.433 --> 27:49.702
Them boys didn't do nothing!
Two of them have warrants!

27:49.736 --> 27:52.138
What about the other two?
Resisting.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.106
You always say
they're resisting!
Hey, hey! Calm down! Calm down!

27:54.140 --> 27:56.208
I need you all
to allow these officers

27:56.242 --> 27:57.744
to take these men
into custody.

27:57.777 --> 28:00.747
Men? One of them is 16!
Listen to me!

28:00.780 --> 28:02.715
Listen to me!

28:02.749 --> 28:05.284
You have my word they'll be
treated respectfully.

28:05.317 --> 28:06.819
(crowd grumbling)

28:10.456 --> 28:14.193
Now, let 'em through.
Let 'em through!

28:14.226 --> 28:16.062
Back up, please.
Back up, please.

28:16.095 --> 28:19.165
(clamoring continues)

28:27.774 --> 28:29.075
You can't just ignore
Hicks's orders

28:29.108 --> 28:30.910
and expect me to
cover for you.

28:30.943 --> 28:32.511
There are better ways
to find the shooter.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.946
Now Deacon says
you're going

28:33.980 --> 28:35.882
down to the hospital
to see Raymont Harris.

28:35.915 --> 28:37.149
He's out of surgery,
he's conscious.

28:37.183 --> 28:38.785
I want to pay
my respects.
No.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.787
We both know
there's a lawsuit coming.

28:40.820 --> 28:43.890
So you can't see that kid.

28:45.858 --> 28:48.327
Hey.

28:48.360 --> 28:52.264
Been trying to read your
tone the last 24 hours.

28:52.298 --> 28:54.300
Not exactly sure
where you and I are at.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.102
You're under
my direct command now.

28:56.135 --> 28:58.370
No relationships allowed.

28:58.404 --> 29:01.440
You're saying maybe
we should discuss this

29:01.473 --> 29:03.342
a little further later tonight,
at your place?

29:03.375 --> 29:06.045
No.

29:06.078 --> 29:09.148
You saying tomorrow night, then?

29:09.181 --> 29:11.550
(chuckles)

29:11.583 --> 29:15.487
Hondo, don't make
this hard, okay?

29:16.923 --> 29:18.224
If we want to stay together,

29:18.257 --> 29:20.359
it means one of us
has to give up our job.

29:20.392 --> 29:22.394
Well, I'm not letting you give
up yours; you work way too hard.

29:22.428 --> 29:24.463
And I'm not letting you
give up yours.

29:24.496 --> 29:27.466
What you're doing is
too important.

29:27.499 --> 29:30.169
Guess that settles that, then.

29:34.340 --> 29:36.542
See you tomorrow, boss.

29:38.845 --> 29:42.014
(door opens, closes)

29:45.985 --> 29:47.820
(grunting)

29:55.261 --> 29:56.362
Hey.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.230
Hey.

30:04.336 --> 30:07.339
Thought I'd, uh,
get an early start.

30:07.373 --> 30:10.109
Yeah, me, too.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.244
(panting)

30:22.354 --> 30:23.856
Hey, Street.

30:23.890 --> 30:26.158
You want to know how
you ended up on my team?

30:26.192 --> 30:27.860
How's that?

30:27.894 --> 30:30.629
Buck Spivey recommended you.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.264
Yeah?

30:32.298 --> 30:34.166
You know, Buck taught me
everything I know about SWAT.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.167
Just not...

30:35.201 --> 30:37.036
Not everything he knows.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.604
Yeah, I heard that one.

30:38.637 --> 30:41.040
(panting)

30:41.073 --> 30:43.509
How far you and Buck go back?

30:43.542 --> 30:45.477
Since I was a kid.

30:45.511 --> 30:47.313
Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

30:47.346 --> 30:50.316
What, he coach your
Little League team?

30:50.349 --> 30:54.386
He, uh... he knew my mom.

30:54.420 --> 30:55.654
He date her or something?

30:55.687 --> 30:57.489
Put her in prison.

31:01.493 --> 31:03.896
Is she still there?
Yup.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.998
Next question.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.972
Look, kid,

31:13.005 --> 31:14.440
when I was new to SWAT,

31:14.473 --> 31:16.608
I prided myself on being
the first one in the door,

31:16.642 --> 31:18.344
never scared of nothing.

31:19.711 --> 31:22.014
But then Buck sat me down,

31:22.048 --> 31:24.450
and he said whatever
anger is motivating me,

31:24.483 --> 31:26.118
I better find someplace else
to put it,

31:26.152 --> 31:29.121
or it might be the person
next to me that I get killed.

31:30.422 --> 31:32.624
I got no idea
what's going on in your life.

31:32.658 --> 31:34.693
But whatever it is,
I'm telling you,

31:34.726 --> 31:38.130
find someplace else to put it.

31:45.504 --> 31:48.040
(indistinct chatter)

32:03.355 --> 32:05.324
(monitor beeping steadily)

32:05.357 --> 32:08.060
This isn't your place.

32:08.094 --> 32:11.163
I know it isn't.

32:11.197 --> 32:13.565
None of us should be
here right now.

32:13.599 --> 32:16.168
Ma'am, would you
mind if I said

32:16.202 --> 32:19.271
just a few words to your son?

32:25.577 --> 32:27.179
You were the one that saved me.

32:27.213 --> 32:28.647
GERALD:
His partner was the one

32:28.680 --> 32:30.649
that tried to kill you.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.620
(sighs)

32:34.653 --> 32:36.122
The surgeon saved you,
Raymont.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.157
I just helped you get here
in one piece.

32:38.190 --> 32:39.758
I want you to know

32:39.791 --> 32:41.660
how sorry I am
this happened to you.

32:41.693 --> 32:44.396
Nobody on the force wanted this.

32:50.136 --> 32:53.672
Look, the truth is...

32:53.705 --> 32:57.043
when I was younger,
I got into it with the cops.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.711
I didn't do nothing wrong,
but somehow I still ended up

32:59.745 --> 33:03.382
with a broken arm and my face
down in the pavement.

33:05.184 --> 33:06.652
I went home, and for weeks,

33:06.685 --> 33:09.521
I was bitching about the cops
this and the cops that.

33:09.555 --> 33:11.557
But finally, my daddy looked
at me, and he said,

33:11.590 --> 33:13.559
"Boy, if you really want to do
something to change

33:13.592 --> 33:16.128
the police, join them."

33:17.529 --> 33:20.166
And I did.

33:20.199 --> 33:22.801
My point is, you're the type
of kid that I promised myself

33:22.834 --> 33:25.637
I would always try to protect.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.043
Thank you.

33:31.077 --> 33:33.645
You get better.

33:45.224 --> 33:47.559
*

33:51.797 --> 33:53.832
What?

33:53.865 --> 33:56.535
NEWS ANCHOR: It was opened
in our mailroom 30 minutes ago.

33:56.568 --> 33:59.138
The writer vows to kill
two African-American children

33:59.171 --> 34:02.474
in Los Angeles as they leave
school this afternoon,

34:02.508 --> 34:05.511
in retaliation
for the two white victims killed

34:05.544 --> 34:08.580
at the rally
in Avalon Park yesterday.

34:08.614 --> 34:11.450
(school bell ringing)

34:11.483 --> 34:13.719
LUCA: Don't let those guys
catch up. Come on now.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.787
MAN: That's my son!
LUCA: Back up. No, no, no.

34:15.821 --> 34:18.157
So you go. Perfect.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.326
There we go. Find any seat

34:20.359 --> 34:22.694
on the bus, okay?

34:22.728 --> 34:24.296
You got it. Come
over here, buddy.

34:24.330 --> 34:26.298
Here we go, love.

34:26.332 --> 34:28.667
Let's go. On the bus.

34:33.372 --> 34:35.707
LUCA:
Keep going to the back.

34:37.643 --> 34:40.612
You're Raymont's cousin,
right?

34:41.780 --> 34:43.282
Yeah.

34:43.315 --> 34:44.483
What's up?

34:44.516 --> 34:47.353
Hey, look, man,
I'm no snitch.

34:47.386 --> 34:49.555
Sure. I see that.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.290
But I appreciate what
you said in the hospital.

34:51.323 --> 34:53.592
And I see
what you're doing here.

34:53.625 --> 34:55.761
I get you're different
than the rest of them.

34:55.794 --> 34:57.796
So this is just us talking,
not me snitching.

34:57.829 --> 34:59.598
Of course.

34:59.631 --> 35:01.533
I had this friend
that I grew up with.

35:01.567 --> 35:02.534
Good cat.

35:02.568 --> 35:03.702
Funny.

35:03.735 --> 35:05.371
Joined the Army.

35:05.404 --> 35:07.173
I didn't see him for a while.

35:07.206 --> 35:10.509
Came home a couple months ago,
talking all this nonsense

35:10.542 --> 35:12.844
about needing to tear down
the system.

35:12.878 --> 35:16.248
Just last week I saw him,
and he was talking like

35:16.282 --> 35:18.750
things were happening and I was
never gonna see him again.

35:18.784 --> 35:21.387
The thing is,
what he did in the Army,

35:21.420 --> 35:23.255
he was a sniper.

35:23.289 --> 35:25.391
I don't know if that's
got anything to do

35:25.424 --> 35:27.793
with what went down
in the park, but...

35:27.826 --> 35:29.461
What's his name?

35:29.495 --> 35:31.530
Daronte Drummond.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.332
Where does he live?

35:33.365 --> 35:35.334
GERALD: Said he and these
white dudes from his unit

35:35.367 --> 35:38.437
were sharing a crib
in Echo Park.

35:48.414 --> 35:50.749
HONDO:
Street!

36:03.495 --> 36:04.630
Stay down.

36:06.265 --> 36:08.667
Runner!

36:18.710 --> 36:19.678
Right side clear!

36:19.711 --> 36:21.413
TAN:
Left side clear!

36:21.447 --> 36:22.748
STREET:
Room clear!

36:22.781 --> 36:24.683
HONDO:
There's no Daronte.

36:24.716 --> 36:26.485
Boss!

36:34.426 --> 36:36.395
STREET:
Check it out.

36:36.428 --> 36:38.730
That's Daronte

36:38.764 --> 36:40.732
with our two guys
from Hook and Go Towing.

36:40.766 --> 36:44.670
And that's the guy Buck
was chasing the other night.

36:45.404 --> 36:46.938
This is all connected.

36:46.972 --> 36:48.307
TAN: How?
HONDO: I don't know.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.741
But Street, Tan, grab Deacon,

36:49.775 --> 36:51.610
get down to that garage. Go!

36:52.378 --> 36:53.412
This rooftop.

36:53.445 --> 36:54.780
Chris, where the hell is this?

36:54.813 --> 36:56.515
That's downtown
by 4th and Fig.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.284
All right, let's move.

37:02.354 --> 37:03.655
HONDO:
What'd he say?

37:03.689 --> 37:05.824
Not much.
Our gunrunner Yorba confirmed

37:05.857 --> 37:08.527
he was selling weapons
to a group of ex-military guys.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.262
No. Something doesn't add up.

37:10.296 --> 37:11.930
Why is a black guy threatening
black schoolkids

37:11.963 --> 37:13.465
as payback for two white people
that he killed?

37:13.499 --> 37:15.401
Daronte and those guys

37:15.434 --> 37:17.436
from Hook and Go
were discharged from the Army

37:17.469 --> 37:19.338
after posting online about
overthrowing the government.

37:19.371 --> 37:22.274
They bought the guns
from Yorba's crew.

37:22.308 --> 37:23.642
When Raymont Harris

37:23.675 --> 37:24.776
gets accidentally shot,

37:24.810 --> 37:26.612
they take advantage
of all the anger.

37:26.645 --> 37:28.046
Drummond shoots the two people
at the rally

37:28.079 --> 37:30.282
to get this city
to turn on itself.

37:30.316 --> 37:31.850
This isn't racial.

37:31.883 --> 37:34.386
It's political.

37:36.388 --> 37:38.290
(tires screeching)

37:38.324 --> 37:40.959
*

38:07.386 --> 38:08.920
CHRIS: What was his plan?
They can't shoot

38:08.954 --> 38:11.923
any schoolkids from here.
So what's the target?

38:12.558 --> 38:14.360
Get me through, get me through.

38:14.393 --> 38:15.861
Left side clear.

38:15.894 --> 38:17.529
TAN:
Right side clear.

38:17.563 --> 38:18.897
Room clear.

38:22.901 --> 38:25.471
"And the dead officers are
proof of your stupidity.

38:25.504 --> 38:28.340
"The money we took from your
bank will go towards destroying

38:28.374 --> 38:30.609
the corrupt system you
foolishly worship."

38:30.642 --> 38:31.610
Dead officers?

38:31.643 --> 38:34.112
I don't think we were
supposed to find that yet.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.447
Let's roll out.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.716
Hondo.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.451
They're planning
on taking down some bank.

38:39.485 --> 38:40.519
(sirens wailing in distance)

38:40.552 --> 38:43.389
Is that Mumford and his guys?

38:43.422 --> 38:45.023
Yeah. What the hell?

38:45.056 --> 38:46.625
Cortez!

38:46.658 --> 38:48.360
What's 50-David doing downtown?

38:48.394 --> 38:50.462
There's a silent alarm
at First Finance Bank.

38:50.496 --> 38:52.464
Mumford's team
was the only one in the area.

38:52.498 --> 38:54.466
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

38:54.500 --> 38:56.735
Didn't you say there was
a bank robbery during

38:56.768 --> 38:58.904
the rally shootings and most of
the cops in the city were there?

38:58.937 --> 39:00.005
That's right.

39:00.038 --> 39:01.540
And now there's
another bank job.

39:01.573 --> 39:02.541
And all our cops

39:02.574 --> 39:04.376
are watching the schools.

39:04.410 --> 39:05.511
These are the same guys.

39:05.544 --> 39:06.745
It's an ambush.

39:06.778 --> 39:09.347
Cortez. We need...
(gunfire)

39:19.024 --> 39:20.392
HONDO:
Go! Go!

39:25.797 --> 39:28.066
(siren wailing)

39:28.099 --> 39:29.768
HONDO: Deac, there's
a robbery going down

39:29.801 --> 39:31.570
at First Finance Bank on Grand.

39:31.603 --> 39:32.738
Head straight there.

39:32.771 --> 39:33.939
You heard him.

39:35.541 --> 39:37.876
(officer grunting,
crowd murmuring)

39:40.946 --> 39:42.948
MAN:
Their cars got trashed.

39:42.981 --> 39:45.517
(people screaming)

39:52.057 --> 39:53.825
MAN:
Get back!

39:58.730 --> 40:00.966
I got the rabbit! Get Mumford!

40:12.010 --> 40:14.546
(siren wailing)

40:16.748 --> 40:18.984
Take care of business, fellas.

40:19.785 --> 40:22.120
(tires screeching)

40:26.492 --> 40:27.759
Why'd we let him drive?

40:28.660 --> 40:30.095
(woman screaming)
Come on, come on!

40:30.128 --> 40:32.664
(men shouting)

40:34.199 --> 40:36.802
Quit shooting,
get inside!

40:36.835 --> 40:39.471
(siren wailing)

40:42.641 --> 40:43.909
Street.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.811
Street!

40:45.844 --> 40:47.679
Street!

40:59.525 --> 41:01.660
Rick, get up!

41:04.930 --> 41:07.933
*

41:18.744 --> 41:20.011
(both grunting)

41:39.665 --> 41:41.032
(panting)

41:41.066 --> 41:42.568
Hey.

41:44.202 --> 41:45.971
I would've had him.

41:46.004 --> 41:48.273
* Yeah

41:48.306 --> 41:50.542
* Uh-huh

41:50.576 --> 41:52.277
* There's only one place
I'd rather be... *

41:52.310 --> 41:54.813
STREET: No catch? All I got
to do is not get pinned

41:54.846 --> 41:56.147
inside a second,

41:56.181 --> 41:58.049
cash is mine.
That easy.

41:58.083 --> 42:00.185
Beautiful.

42:00.218 --> 42:01.653
All right.

42:01.687 --> 42:03.054
One...

42:03.088 --> 42:04.590
two...

42:04.623 --> 42:05.591
three!

42:05.624 --> 42:06.692
(shouts)

42:06.725 --> 42:08.727
Luca's department champ,

42:08.760 --> 42:10.161
three years running.

42:10.195 --> 42:11.863
That's the easiest
money ever.

42:11.897 --> 42:13.031
Better luck next time,
Long Beach.

42:13.064 --> 42:14.299
Anyway.
TAN:
Hey, man.

42:14.332 --> 42:15.901
Congratulations, Luca.

42:15.934 --> 42:17.168
Here's your cut.

42:17.202 --> 42:18.604
LUCA:
Really?
TAN: Here's
your cut.

42:18.637 --> 42:20.238
Where you going?

42:22.774 --> 42:25.844
Nobody likes the boss messing
up a perfectly good party.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.278
Hey!

42:27.312 --> 42:29.615
Good work today.

42:29.648 --> 42:31.783
I'm out.
All right.

42:31.817 --> 42:33.018
Have a good one, boss.

42:33.051 --> 42:34.620
Night.

42:34.653 --> 42:35.787
Deac.
Ah!

42:35.821 --> 42:37.756
(knocking on door)

42:42.828 --> 42:47.198
I forgot my toothbrush.

42:50.636 --> 42:53.905
You disobeyed my order not
to see Raymont in the hospital.

42:55.306 --> 42:58.143
Everyone who works for me
gets one free one.

42:58.176 --> 43:00.746
Nobody gets a second.

43:06.251 --> 43:08.787
I'm sorry.

43:23.869 --> 43:26.204
(phone beeping)

43:35.180 --> 43:37.716
*

43:47.693 --> 43:49.094
We're up!

43:49.127 --> 43:51.663
Ooh!

43:56.301 --> 43:58.236
(siren wailing)

43:58.269 --> 44:00.806
